00:10.900 --> 00:12.633
Your friend Dary
said he can beat up

00:12.666 --> 00:14.766
your friend Dan
the other day.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.866
WAYNE:
You're dreaming, bud.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.266
DARYL: Am not.
DAN: Are, too.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.166
You're Joseph
and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat, bud.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.733
All I'm saying is,
if it came down to it
and I hope it wouldn't...

00:22.766 --> 00:24.200
Well, see you're soft
on it already, Dary.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.366
I could beat Dan
in a fight.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.966
You're mixing
a Hardy, bud.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.333
Am not.
Are, too.

00:28.366 --> 00:30.700
You're down there
mixing a Tom Hardy.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.166
Oh, I would smash
that dude

00:32.200 --> 00:33.733
like a Terry's
Chocolate Orange

00:33.766 --> 00:35.333
Same. How's your beers?

00:35.366 --> 00:36.433
ALL: I'll have a beer.

00:36.466 --> 00:37.833
Must be nice,
you can pick up
some extra shifts here

00:37.866 --> 00:40.933
while Gail's down
at her South American
Single's Resort, huh, Bonnie?

00:40.966 --> 00:42.666
You wanna know what?
If two of my bars burnt down

00:42.700 --> 00:43.933
I'd be fucking off, too.

00:43.966 --> 00:45.200
I'm envious
of that old goat.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.266
It's light lifting.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.333
This place could run
off honor system
if it had to.

00:48.366 --> 00:49.833
DARYL: Okay,
Katy and Bonnie,

00:49.866 --> 00:52.000
who do you think
would win a fight,
me or Dan?

00:52.033 --> 00:53.333
Dan.
(SIGHS)

00:53.366 --> 00:54.700
Why don't you two
just arm wrestle

00:54.733 --> 00:56.066
and get
to the bottom of it.
No.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.500
Why not?

00:57.533 --> 01:00.033
Well, because arm wrestling
is not a legitimate barometer
for strength,

01:00.066 --> 01:01.133
and certainly
not toughness.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.166
You're either born
a good arm wrestler
or you're not.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.733
Youse could leg wrestle.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.033
WAYNE: No.
Why not?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.100
Well, because if they're
on the floor rubbing
their legs together,

01:08.133 --> 01:09.333
they've both lost.

01:09.366 --> 01:11.133
How are we gonna
sort this out?
Oh, youse could have to fight.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.666
No.
Sure.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.066
See, you're
a good friend, Dan.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.333
How is Dan
a good friend
in all of this?

01:15.366 --> 01:17.133
Well, Dan sees you're
quite upset about this.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.500
He's willing to put
his beer down,

01:18.533 --> 01:20.066
come over there
and beat the shit out of you
so that you're over it.

01:21.933 --> 01:25.700
Tyson, who would win
in a fight between
Dan and Dary?

01:25.733 --> 01:27.700
Dary.
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

01:27.733 --> 01:30.000
KATY: Why?
Longer reach,
quicker on his feet.

01:30.033 --> 01:31.833
Not above a nut shot
or a hair pull.

01:31.866 --> 01:33.633
Joint Boy?
Squirrelly Dan.

01:33.666 --> 01:35.300
KATY: Why?
'Cause he's Squirrelly.

01:37.133 --> 01:39.833
Who do youse think
would win in a fight
between you two?

01:39.866 --> 01:41.300
(BOTH SCOFF)
BOTH: Me.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.700
BOTH: You?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.233
BOTH: Me.

01:49.966 --> 01:51.233
(THUDDING)

01:53.366 --> 01:55.333
See, now there's a good friend.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.366

02:05.766 --> 02:08.133
Fifteen‐four

02:08.166 --> 02:10.100

You're right, Dan.

03:33.733 --> 03:34.866
It's okay, good buddy.

It's just that I, uh...

03:38.700 --> 03:41.000
...wish I could take
some of her pain
from last year,

03:41.966 --> 03:43.266

He's been spelling
out of his own weight class
for years now.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.900
Like, she forgot
a silent E.

04:03.933 --> 04:06.066
Completely out
of character for her.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.366
Do you wanna know what?
That silent E may follow

04:07.400 --> 04:09.033
her around
for the rest of her life.

04:09.066 --> 04:11.066
She's worns it

KATY: Who's doing all
the hollering down there?

04:29.066 --> 04:31.266
She's tryings
to studies, Waynes.

04:35.966 --> 04:38.066
Like, it's clear
what needs to be done here.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.333
Wanna make a pact?
Of course, we makes
a pacts, Dary.

04:40.366 --> 04:42.633
I'm surprised we're not
making a pact right now.

04:42.666 --> 04:45.066
We works around the clocks
to helps her get her spellings

04:45.100 --> 04:46.200
ups to hers potential.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.300
We don't sleep.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.966
Keep her focused.
Keep her inspired.

04:49.733 --> 04:50.866
Keep her hydrated.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.633
We're coming in.

04:55.666 --> 04:56.733
So cover up.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.000
REILLY: Okay, girls.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.633
Girls?
That's what I said.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.000
Who you calling girls?

05:04.033 --> 05:07.800
(STAMMERS) Oh. No,
we mean women.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.400
Yes, that is my bad.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.400
I am sorry.
It is an old habit.

05:11.433 --> 05:14.000
See, we call the men
on our team "Boys."
So I just...

05:14.033 --> 05:15.300
It's completely inappropriate.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.666
Okay.
Mary‐Anne over there
is not a girl.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.833
When's the last time
you saw a girl's tits
sag so low,

05:19.866 --> 05:21.266
she could tuck 'em
into her joggers?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.766
You're right,
Betty‐Anne.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.133
To call us girls is
wildly inappropriate.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.200
Look at you.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.400
When's the last time
you saw a girl

05:27.433 --> 05:29.733
with enough pubic hair
to lose her keys in?

05:29.766 --> 05:31.900
Along with the buoyant
Canadian Tire key chain?

05:31.933 --> 05:34.300
Okay, okay, okay.
That's enough, uh...

05:35.733 --> 05:37.166
Ladies.
Yes, ladies.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.933
I'm even
more offended
by that.

05:38.966 --> 05:40.333
Tell me how
Mary‐Anne's a lady?

05:40.366 --> 05:42.066
Her Jill‐strap's got
more skid marks

05:42.100 --> 05:44.300
than a runaway truck
laying on a coastal
mountain highway.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.933
Yes, I'm afraid
you guys missed
the mark again.

05:46.966 --> 05:48.066
Betty‐Anne's no lady.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.866
She picks and flicks
more boogers

05:49.900 --> 05:52.400
than a restless
Dutch eight‐year‐old
with Asperger.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.000
Well‐done, Mary‐Anne.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.433
You're unpredictably articulate

05:55.466 --> 05:58.000
for a girl who waves
goodbye to her pee
when she flushes the toilet.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.633
You wanna talk
about unpredictable,
Betty‐Anne?

06:00.666 --> 06:03.000
Who would have thought
the girl who ingested
mosquito eggs

06:03.033 --> 06:04.666
after drinking
out of mud puddles

06:04.700 --> 06:07.300
would ever almost
be accepted
to community college.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.366

get out here.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.266

It's getting pretty cold
out there, eh?

06:19.166 --> 06:21.633
Down to almost
ten Degrassi Junior Highs.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.100
You guys bring your coats?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.666
(BOTH STAMMER)
I'm just kidding.
I don't give a fuck.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.133
I'm used to you two
embarrassing me.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.033
I go to bed at night,
fucking embarrassing.

06:28.066 --> 06:30.233
I get up in the morning,
fucking embarrassing.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.666
The only time you two
have ever humiliated me

06:33.700 --> 06:35.266
is when you
started spelling.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.933
Now please, tell me.
You put in the work this year.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.700
We always put in
the work, coach.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.066
We never wanna
let you down
or the boys.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.100
But we've been upfront
about being

06:45.133 --> 06:47.166
dog‐shit spellers
from get go, so...

06:47.200 --> 06:49.366
We're trying our best,
but we're Math guys,
Coach.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.233
Don't fucking bullshit me.

06:53.266 --> 06:57.033
Okay, if it were a
Chelling Bee.., I mean...

06:57.066 --> 07:00.066
Dog‐shit spellers.
Unreal chellers.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.066
(SNAPS FINGERS)
You two, focus!

07:02.100 --> 07:03.200
I have money
on this, all right?

07:03.233 --> 07:05.800
And for me to get that money,
I've done a little...

07:05.833 --> 07:07.800
tinkering behind the scenes.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.900
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yes.

07:09.933 --> 07:13.366
I think you two
are going to do
quite well this year.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.000

07:35.133 --> 07:37.000
(STRUMMING GUITAR)

07:40.266 --> 07:42.366
Hey, Katy,
I made you a smoothie.
It's on the counter.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.700
What's in it?

07:43.733 --> 07:45.333
Half an avocado,
half a banana,

07:45.366 --> 07:46.866
half a cup
of blueberries,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.666
a scoop of vanilla‐whey
protein powder,

07:48.700 --> 07:50.700
half a cup of water,
13 almonds.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.200
Hope you're
not triskaidekaphobic.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.333
That's the fear
of the number 13.

07:54.366 --> 07:55.766
You can spell
that, right?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.933
It's one of the most commonly
used words in spelling bees,
everybody can.

07:58.966 --> 08:00.000
You staying hydrated?

08:00.733 --> 08:02.100
What are you doing?

08:02.133 --> 08:04.000
Who me? Sudoku.

08:04.033 --> 08:06.700
Didn't you not know
that doing number puzzles
and games increases

08:06.733 --> 08:08.000
the neuroplasticity
within the brain

08:08.033 --> 08:09.933
and helps it
reorganize itself.

08:09.966 --> 08:11.000
Did you wanna do one?

08:11.033 --> 08:12.100
No.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.666
Dan, why are
you lifting weights?

08:15.700 --> 08:16.833
Who's? Mes?

08:16.866 --> 08:18.633
Didn't you nots knows
that exercisings

08:18.666 --> 08:21.266
allows your brains
to takes on the proteins
called BDNF,

08:21.300 --> 08:23.700
which helps with focus,
concentrations and memories?

08:23.733 --> 08:25.066
Here's, I gots ones
for youse, too.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.200
No.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.333
What?

08:29.366 --> 08:30.633
You play guitar now?

08:30.666 --> 08:32.800
Who me?
Of course, I do.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.333
Didn't you not know
that playing an instrument

08:34.366 --> 08:35.900
