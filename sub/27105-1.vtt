01:01.722 --> 01:04.081
Uh, hey, Jenna.

01:04.081 --> 01:07.412
Hey, Max.

01:07.422 --> 01:09.622
-Thanks for calling me.
-Yeah.

01:09.622 --> 01:12.652
I saw we were both orphans
on this holiday

01:12.662 --> 01:14.602
and figured we might as well
be orphans together.

01:14.602 --> 01:17.102
Anything's better than
being alone on Christmas Eve.

01:18.472 --> 01:19.632
Yeah.

01:19.632 --> 01:22.803
That sounded awful.
I'm sorry.

01:22.803 --> 01:25.033
No.
It's all right.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.972
So, uh, what is this?

01:26.972 --> 01:29.603
I have no idea,

01:29.613 --> 01:31.642
but I'm pretty sure it's
the only thing playing tonight.

01:31.652 --> 01:34.182
Sounds fantastic.

01:34.182 --> 01:36.913
Although, looks like
a hot ticket.

01:36.923 --> 01:38.192
Hope we can get a seat.

01:38.192 --> 01:39.793
Don't worry.
I made reservations.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.532
Smart man.

01:57.173 --> 01:58.632
Hello.

02:00.973 --> 02:05.913
Uh, there should be two tickets
under Max Clayton.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.234
Okay. All set.

02:22.933 --> 02:26.793
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Just one minute.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.504
Okay.
Sorry about that.

03:06.514 --> 03:08.254
-Want to go inside?
-Uh, sure.

03:13.014 --> 03:14.775
When I was a kid,
I thought it was

03:14.785 --> 03:17.615
"visions of Sugar Plum <i> Fairies</i>
dancing in their heads."

03:17.625 --> 03:19.194
Isn't it?

03:40.914 --> 03:43.085
Interesting crowd.

03:43.085 --> 03:46.885
I guess this is the Christmas
Eve theater crowd, looks like.

05:13.676 --> 05:15.746
Yeah, I'm still on hold.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.677
Do you ever get a negative
answer to that question?

05:18.677 --> 05:19.907
I got to be out of here
by 6:00.

05:22.087 --> 05:24.687
Darren will nail you before you
get anywhere near that exit.

05:24.687 --> 05:28.027
Yeah. Can you see if you can
get that clean this time?

05:28.027 --> 05:30.227
I got to get the twins' toys
together when I get home.

05:30.227 --> 05:31.697
I heard it's mandatory now

05:31.697 --> 05:33.328
because Suzanne
bawled her eyes out

05:33.328 --> 05:35.087
when no one showed up last year.

05:35.097 --> 05:37.167
Oh, shit, the gift exchange.

05:51.048 --> 05:52.788
What are you saying?
I-I-I...

05:52.788 --> 05:55.208
Time is now.
Godspeed.

05:55.218 --> 05:58.423
No, your partner's an idiot.
I don't know why I pay you.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.977
What am I paying you for?

05:59.987 --> 06:01.348
Oh, my God,
you're like my ex-girlfriend.

06:01.358 --> 06:03.688
All you do is bitch.

06:03.688 --> 06:07.157
Just get in there and fucking
tell them, "Quality. Quality."

06:07.157 --> 06:09.757
That's what we are.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.268
Oh, my God.

06:21.344 --> 06:23.238
It's been a good year
for Chem-Ways.

06:23.248 --> 06:26.118
We've seen some pretty good
growth across the board.

06:26.118 --> 06:29.918
So I would like to take
this moment to dole out

06:29.918 --> 06:33.178
some individual congratulations
on a job well done.

06:34.758 --> 06:36.258
Oh, we're gonna have to
put a pin in that.

06:36.258 --> 06:39.028
I've got to
hop on this call.

06:39.028 --> 06:41.468
Spencer, can I get you
to take over?

06:42.968 --> 06:45.838
Go for Darren.

06:45.838 --> 06:49.309
Uhh huh huh huh...

06:49.309 --> 06:52.778
Suzanne, you wanted
to go over some rules.

06:52.778 --> 06:54.749
Uh, yes, thank you.

06:54.749 --> 06:58.418
Okay, here are the rules.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.878
Someone will open a gift,

07:00.878 --> 07:06.019
and the next person who opens
one can either keep the gift

07:06.019 --> 07:10.049
or they can steal someone else's
already opened gift.

07:10.059 --> 07:11.289
Got it?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.929
Oh!
This is gonna be so much fun!

07:28.080 --> 07:30.979
Alissa, why don't you go first?

07:30.979 --> 07:32.309
Sure, why not?

07:37.349 --> 07:40.220
This looks like something
I could use.

07:43.929 --> 07:45.830
Balsamic vinegar.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.460
I make it myself!

07:47.460 --> 07:49.459
Let's hope no one
steals that away from you.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.870
Let's hope.

07:51.799 --> 07:53.430
Ty, why don't you
go next, sweetie?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.110
Okay.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.950
-Hey.
-Ah, just kidding.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.090
Holy fuck!

08:17.290 --> 08:18.920
I'll call 911.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.460
I don't have a signal.

08:22.470 --> 08:24.501
The door's jammed.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.460
There's no signal
on mine either.

08:27.470 --> 08:29.501
Oh, my God!

08:32.380 --> 08:35.480
Scott! Scott! Scott!

08:35.480 --> 08:37.380
Try the office line!

09:01.471 --> 09:05.442
<i>I can't wait</i>
<i>to watch you all die.</i>

09:13.251 --> 09:14.581
Who is this?

09:14.581 --> 09:16.881
<i>Interrupt me again, Spencer,</i>

09:16.891 --> 09:19.161
<i>and I'll eat</i>
<i>your fucking heart out!</i>

09:22.892 --> 09:23.991
What is that?

09:23.991 --> 09:28.521
<i>I'm filling the room with gas.</i>

09:34.171 --> 09:38.372
<i>And if you don't listen,</i>
<i>you're all gonna die!</i>

09:40.642 --> 09:42.612
<i>I've added a few presents</i>
<i>of my own.</i>

09:42.612 --> 09:46.641
<i>Take turns opening them.</i>

09:46.651 --> 09:49.582
<i>Some</i> could <i> save you, but...</i>

09:51.252 --> 09:53.682
<i>If you live, I'll let you go.</i>

09:55.632 --> 09:58.462
<i>And if you don't play,</i>
<i>you die.</i>

10:05.142 --> 10:07.642
<i>You have 10 minutes</i>

10:07.642 --> 10:09.283
<i>before I kill you myself.</i>

10:10.542 --> 10:12.642
O-Okay, I have to go.
I have to go now.

10:12.642 --> 10:15.272
-All right, calm down.
-No, no, I can't do this!

10:15.282 --> 10:17.152
-I have to leave. This is crazy.
-Listen, we have 10 minutes.

10:17.152 --> 10:18.623
We've just got to
play his game...

10:18.623 --> 10:21.193
I'm not touching anything
on this table.

10:21.193 --> 10:22.652
I'll go first.

10:40.242 --> 10:41.273
It's empty.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.273
Let me see that.

10:44.673 --> 10:46.373
Bad move, asshole.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.173
What is it?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.283
Manny.

10:56.293 --> 10:58.123
Manny.

10:58.123 --> 11:01.723
Manny, help me, please.

11:01.733 --> 11:05.234
Hey, hey. You break that, and
all that gas is coming in here.

11:15.614 --> 11:17.284
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you,

11:17.284 --> 11:19.704
you psycho son of a bitch!

11:28.354 --> 11:30.514
-You gonna go next?
-Hell no!

11:30.524 --> 11:32.524
He said everyone has to go.

11:32.524 --> 11:35.224
Well, he can go fuck himself!

11:37.264 --> 11:38.594
Scott.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.635
Wait, wait, wait!

12:22.115 --> 12:23.245
What if it's a bomb?

12:32.555 --> 12:35.865
Everyone opens their gifts
from over here, okay?

12:39.525 --> 12:40.625
Scott.

12:43.665 --> 12:45.525
Yeah, okay.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.476
Fuck it.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.766
<i> Alissa...</i>

13:55.437 --> 13:56.537
Shut the card.

14:03.317 --> 14:04.686
Kara, shut the card.

14:04.686 --> 14:08.377
Shut the card.
Shut the damn card!

14:12.757 --> 14:13.897
Wait a minute.

14:15.497 --> 14:17.597
Oh, shit.

14:17.597 --> 14:20.327
Little Scotty boy
has a thing for Alissa.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.587
Who cares about that right now?

14:21.597 --> 14:25.397
No.
No, no, think about it.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.907
I'm onto something here.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.978
So, what was it, Scott?
Were you in love with her?

14:31.907 --> 14:34.438
Must have been a real bitch
to know she was fucking Ty.

14:34.448 --> 14:36.818
-Knock it off, Manny.
-Get off me.

14:36.818 --> 14:38.417
He's trapped in here
with the rest of us.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.752
Yeah, and Ty's brains
are all over the wall!

14:40.753 --> 14:42.548
This sick psycho
probably got off on it.

14:42.558 --> 14:44.588
Manny, stop!

14:44.588 --> 14:47.818
Think about it, Spencer.
It was him.

14:47.828 --> 14:51.362
No one gets in this building
without security clearance.

14:51.363 --> 14:54.628
It had to be one of us, and I'm
picking this jealous psycho.

14:54.628 --> 14:55.957
No.

14:59.668 --> 15:05.538
Tell your friend outside to turn
off the gas and open the door.

15:05.548 --> 15:07.378
It wasn't me.
It wasn't...

15:07.378 --> 15:08.437
It's over!

15:08.447 --> 15:10.288
-But I wasn't...
-Let us out!

15:10.288 --> 15:11.978
That's enough!

16:00.469 --> 16:02.039
Manny!

16:02.039 --> 16:04.469
Oh, no!

16:16.519 --> 16:17.949
No!

16:17.949 --> 16:20.549
Oh, God, no!

16:28.429 --> 16:30.629
Oh, f...
Oh, my God.

16:51.950 --> 16:54.810
<i> Ohh!</i>

16:54.820 --> 16:57.620
<i>Scott! No!</i>

16:57.620 --> 16:59.390
<i>Scott's gone!</i>

17:05.871 --> 17:07.569
<i>No one told you</i>
<i>to stop playing.</i>

17:11.569 --> 17:13.700
We have to keep going.

18:17.741 --> 18:19.172
Suzanne?

18:19.172 --> 18:21.802
Someone help me
get her away from the vent!

18:21.812 --> 18:24.882
Kara!
Get back!

18:27.152 --> 18:29.082
Come on, help!

18:29.082 --> 18:31.212
It's too late.
Get away! Come on.

18:31.222 --> 18:33.492
No, no!

18:34.852 --> 18:37.482
I'm sorry!

18:46.602 --> 18:49.472
Manny, you've got to go now.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.132
Fuck it.

18:59.912 --> 19:02.112
No, open it
over in the corner.

19:02.112 --> 19:05.643
This blows up, I'm taking
all you assholes with me.

19:20.933 --> 19:24.232
<i>Listen, uh,</i>
<i>I just got word from upstairs.</i>

19:24.242 --> 19:27.578
<i>They want us to start trimming</i>
<i>the fat from this floor.</i>

19:27.579 --> 19:30.773
<i>Honestly, I'm surprised</i>
<i>Manny wasn't fired months ago.</i>

19:33.113 --> 19:34.214
<i> Sounds good.</i>

19:38.953 --> 19:42.253
Manny.
I don't...

19:42.263 --> 19:43.863
You have no idea
the pressure we're under

19:43.863 --> 19:46.564
to turn a profit here.

19:49.134 --> 19:51.534
Come on, Manny.
We have to stick together.

19:51.534 --> 19:54.194
-No, Manny, stop.
-Kara, get out of the way!

19:55.903 --> 19:57.603
Back off!

19:59.274 --> 20:03.874
You fucking asshole.
We really should've fired you.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.824
I just opened this.

20:24.704 --> 20:27.274
What are you doing?!
Get off!

21:30.635 --> 21:33.996
What the hell was that?

21:34.006 --> 21:37.705
I have no idea.

22:12.276 --> 22:15.676
<i>Attention, customers.</i>

22:15.686 --> 22:18.056
<i>The store will be closing</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

22:20.986 --> 22:25.846
<i>Please take your purchases to</i>
<i>the nearest available register.</i>

22:28.326 --> 22:31.826
<i>From all of us here</i>
<i>at Headley's department store,</i>

22:31.826 --> 22:34.727
<i>we'd like to wish you</i>
<i>a very happy holidays.</i>

22:51.787 --> 22:55.127
Hey. I'm literally getting
in the car as we speak.

22:55.127 --> 22:56.386
I got everything.

22:56.386 --> 22:58.816
No, they were out of that.

22:58.826 --> 23:01.797
Well, I got everything the store
wasn't already out of.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.227
No, they didn't
have that either.

23:04.227 --> 23:05.787
I'm getting in
the car right now.

23:05.797 --> 23:09.097
Right now. See you in a bit.
Love you.

23:57.848 --> 23:59.108
No.

24:03.888 --> 24:09.258
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

24:10.299 --> 24:12.139
Fuck!

24:17.909 --> 24:19.949
Aah!

24:20.339 --> 24:21.969
You...

24:32.249 --> 24:35.978
Hello?
I just need to use your phone.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.589
Hello?!

25:35.280 --> 25:38.310
Hello?
I locked my keys...

25:39.420 --> 25:42.321
Hey there.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

25:42.321 --> 25:44.020
I locked myself out of my car.

25:44.030 --> 25:46.160
I was wondering if you had
a phone I could borrow.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.660
- You don't have a phone?
- Yeah, no, I have one.

25:48.660 --> 25:51.560
I just locked it in my car
with my keys.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.240
That sucks.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.240
Uh, yeah, it does.

25:59.411 --> 26:01.981
So do you have one
I could borrow,

26:01.981 --> 26:05.121
just to call
roadside assistance?

26:06.450 --> 26:08.250
Hello?

26:12.221 --> 26:14.681
Sasha, you're making a mess.

26:19.461 --> 26:21.120
Sure.

26:22.261 --> 26:24.461
No problem.

26:26.141 --> 26:28.370
It's a burner.
A prepaid.

26:28.370 --> 26:30.101
So please don't use up
all our minutes.

26:30.111 --> 26:31.681
No problem.
I'll be quick.

26:41.421 --> 26:43.562
Hi, I locked my keys
in my car.

26:43.562 --> 26:50.191
Eric Turner.
Member number is 3433-1D.

26:50.361 --> 26:54.431
Date of birth is 12/25/81.

26:54.431 --> 26:56.122
Thanks.

26:56.132 --> 26:57.962
Yeah, I'd really rather not
spend my birthday

26:57.972 --> 27:00.972
in a parking lot, so please tell
me you can send someone soon.

27:03.142 --> 27:05.212
All right, well, if they can
get here a lot sooner,

27:05.212 --> 27:06.552
then I'd really appreciate it.

27:06.552 --> 27:09.401
Merry Christmas.
Thanks.

27:15.382 --> 27:17.081
Mind if I call my wife?

27:17.091 --> 27:19.022
Of course.
Go ahead.

27:19.022 --> 27:20.282
Be quick.

27:31.602 --> 27:34.733
Hey, it's me.
I'm using someone else's phone.

27:34.743 --> 27:36.412
No, no, no, I'm fine.

27:36.412 --> 27:39.543
I just locked my keys
in the car.

27:39.543 --> 27:42.043
They said 30 to 40 minutes.

27:42.043 --> 27:45.742
No, no, stay there.
No, do not send my dad.

27:45.752 --> 27:47.523
He'd just get lost
and we wouldn't see him again

27:47.523 --> 27:49.323
till the new year.

27:49.323 --> 27:52.393
It's tempting, I know.

27:52.393 --> 27:54.533
I'll be home as soon as I can.

27:58.132 --> 27:59.803
All done?

28:01.303 --> 28:03.042
Yeah. Here.

28:11.543 --> 28:14.273
You sure you don't want
to wait in the van?

28:17.353 --> 28:20.283
You know what?
I should wait by my car.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.813
Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky
and pick the lock.

28:24.623 --> 28:26.353
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

28:26.363 --> 28:28.064
Happy almost birthday.

29:51.815 --> 29:55.514
We decided we couldn't let you
freeze to death on Christmas.

29:57.315 --> 29:58.475
Uh, thanks.

30:16.235 --> 30:17.235
Want some?

30:17.235 --> 30:19.765
No, I'm good.

30:25.716 --> 30:28.346
See? Not poisoned.

30:35.726 --> 30:37.466
So, what was the plan, Eric?

30:38.696 --> 30:39.696
Plan?

30:39.696 --> 30:41.625
Yeah.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.596
You having family over
for Christmas Eve?

30:43.596 --> 30:44.896
Yep, yep.

30:44.896 --> 30:47.896
Wife, kids, parents,
the whole nine.

30:49.976 --> 30:51.705
But you know how family gets.

30:51.705 --> 30:54.236
You're around them too much,
and you just want to...

30:59.217 --> 31:00.956
But it's good too.

31:03.316 --> 31:06.517
Do you two have any plans
for the holidays?

31:07.756 --> 31:08.927
You're looking at it.

31:19.237 --> 31:22.366
Do you need any money?

31:22.366 --> 31:24.597
It's the least I can do
since you... you helped me out.

31:24.607 --> 31:26.267
Thanks, but we're okay.

31:26.277 --> 31:28.847
I didn't mean
to insult you guys.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.747
-I just wanted to...
-We're good.

31:33.347 --> 31:35.446
-Is there someone else...
-What?

31:35.446 --> 31:36.947
Your door's open.

31:36.957 --> 31:39.427
Uh, yeah, it's an old van.
This thing is glitchy.

31:39.427 --> 31:40.747
I got it.

31:43.297 --> 31:45.557
Jesus Christ!

31:45.557 --> 31:47.828
-What else is back there?
-What are you talking about?

31:47.828 --> 31:49.357
There's something
in the back of your van.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.902
-Just us.
-Hey, come out of there!

31:50.903 --> 31:52.858
Dude, there's no one else there.

31:59.607 --> 32:01.007
The tether is
with it, the tether must hold.

32:01.007 --> 32:02.608
The evil must not be free.

32:02.608 --> 32:04.007
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:04.017 --> 32:05.618
The evil must not be free.

32:05.618 --> 32:06.717
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.317
The evil must not be free.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.848
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:09.858 --> 32:11.687
The evil must not be free.

32:11.687 --> 32:13.318
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:13.328 --> 32:15.488
-The evil must not be free.
-Are you okay?

32:15.488 --> 32:17.388
...the tether must hold.
The evil must not be free.

32:17.398 --> 32:18.498
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:18.498 --> 32:19.898
The evil must not be free.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.938
The tether is with it,
the tether must hold.

32:21.938 --> 32:23.857
Aah!
What the fuck?

32:23.867 --> 32:25.438
Renew the tether
with fresh blood.

32:25.438 --> 32:26.838
The new keeper
has been found.

32:26.838 --> 32:30.578
Aah!
Get the fuck off of me!

32:30.578 --> 32:32.408
We're free.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.808
Let's go.

32:33.808 --> 32:35.608
Get off of me!

32:35.608 --> 32:38.638
Sasha, wait!
It's not finished!

32:43.718 --> 32:45.578
Frankie.

32:46.788 --> 32:48.488
How far am I?

33:00.568 --> 33:02.468
Please.

33:03.409 --> 33:05.048
I'll go back.

33:07.648 --> 33:09.479
Please.

33:09.479 --> 33:11.479
I'll go back.

33:11.479 --> 33:13.709
I'll go back.

33:14.689 --> 33:16.459
Please.

33:18.559 --> 33:20.529
Please.

33:23.629 --> 33:24.968
No!

33:32.439 --> 33:35.039
The tether will hold.
The tether will hold.

33:35.039 --> 33:39.699
Aah!
Get the fuck off! Aah!

33:39.709 --> 33:42.640
-...18, 19...
-What the hell is this?

33:42.650 --> 33:45.380
...20,

33:45.380 --> 33:47.049
21.

33:53.459 --> 33:55.560
Oh, shit.

33:55.560 --> 33:58.519
Stop.
Stop or it'll kill your family.

33:58.899 --> 34:01.169
-What?
-If you run, it will kill you.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.469
When it's done with you,
it won't stop killing.

34:03.469 --> 34:05.510
It won't stop until
another tether is found.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.130
You're full of shit.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.840
Hey!
Don't test it, Eric.

34:13.549 --> 34:17.080
-What is it?
-It's pure fucking evil.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.810
You're responsible for it now.

34:22.949 --> 34:25.520
Listen. Listen!

34:25.520 --> 34:27.889
This is important.

34:27.889 --> 34:30.489
Only one who shares
the day of their birth

34:30.500 --> 34:33.971
with the unconquered son
can tether this evil.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.501
It means you were born
on Christmas, Eric.

34:36.501 --> 34:38.761
Just like me,
just like Sasha.

34:38.771 --> 34:41.101
We're the only ones
that can bear the mark,

34:41.110 --> 34:44.011
and we're the only ones
that can keep this evil at bay.

34:44.011 --> 34:45.841
Why?

34:45.841 --> 34:47.870
Who fucking knows?

34:47.880 --> 34:52.850
Okay, you stay within 20 feet of
that thing, and you stay safe.

34:52.850 --> 34:56.880
Your family stays safe.
Everyone's safe.

34:56.891 --> 34:59.461
Once you break that boundary,
you're fucked.

35:01.531 --> 35:03.631
This isn't happening.
I'm going home.

35:03.631 --> 35:07.001
Is your bedroom
within 10 paces of that van?

35:07.001 --> 35:10.471
How about
your children's play room?

35:11.841 --> 35:13.741
You really want that thing
around your family

35:13.741 --> 35:15.811
if you step outside
that circle?

35:23.011 --> 35:24.641
I don't need those.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.221
Maybe you'll get lucky,

35:28.221 --> 35:32.981
find some other loser
born on December 25th.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.631
It only took us three years.

35:52.542 --> 35:56.071
-What's your address?
-Go to hell.

36:01.091 --> 36:02.592
Take me home.

36:02.592 --> 36:04.232
<i>Finding directions home.</i>

36:06.562 --> 36:09.162
I'll leave them
on your doorstep.

36:24.542 --> 36:25.642
Hey.

36:27.682 --> 36:29.882
Happy birthday to us.

36:53.243 --> 36:55.783
This isn't happening.

38:19.964 --> 38:24.404
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>

38:32.374 --> 38:35.805
<i> ...town to bring you joy</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve!</i>

38:35.815 --> 38:39.315
<i>So, Merry Christmas, Steve!</i>

38:39.315 --> 38:41.914
<i>My name's not Steve.</i>

38:42.985 --> 38:45.085
<i>No, I'll come after shopping.</i>

38:45.085 --> 38:46.145
<i> From home.</i>

38:46.155 --> 38:49.255
<i>- No! Get back!</i>

38:49.255 --> 38:51.285
<i>What did you do to him?</i>

38:51.295 --> 38:53.265
<i> You don't know</i>
<i>what you're doing! Don't!</i>

38:59.105 --> 39:01.876
Oh, shit!

39:01.876 --> 39:03.475
Jesus Christ, Michael.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.845
I see you scaled it back
on the decorations this year.

39:05.845 --> 39:07.745
Oh, yeah, my...
my kids like them.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.076
That sounds awful.

39:09.076 --> 39:10.845
Oh, I don't mind
putting up the decorations.

39:10.845 --> 39:12.705
No, I meant having kids.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.486
Uh, speaking of which, my, uh...

39:16.486 --> 39:18.715
my eldest
is collecting donations

39:18.726 --> 39:20.226
for the United National
Christmas Fund.

39:20.226 --> 39:23.896
Wanted to know if you
could toss in a few bucks.

39:23.896 --> 39:27.901
What's wrong? He can't come over
and beg for money himself?

39:27.902 --> 39:30.426
Come on, Chet, it's...
it's for a good cause.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.105
Fine.
Let me get my wallet.

39:33.906 --> 39:35.236
What's happening?

39:35.236 --> 39:37.506
Oh, my God, the door
won't stop closing.

39:37.506 --> 39:39.936
It's like it has
a mind of its own.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.786
I know you trashed
my light-up Santa!

39:44.786 --> 39:46.356
Asshole.

39:48.287 --> 39:50.457
<i>It's just a meager pittance.</i>

39:50.457 --> 39:52.857
<i>It does not matter</i>
<i>in the least.</i>

39:52.857 --> 39:55.857
<i>His heart does not</i>
<i>warm that way.</i>

40:00.237 --> 40:03.866
<i>-But it's Christmas.</i>
<i>-He cares not about the date.</i>

40:03.866 --> 40:04.826
Fuck this.

40:21.057 --> 40:23.157
-Linda.
-You've got to be kidding me.

40:23.157 --> 40:25.527
-It's Christmas Eve.
-That isn't work, is it?

40:25.527 --> 40:27.267
No. No, Mom,
it's just a friend.

40:27.267 --> 40:29.887
A friend she's banging.

40:29.897 --> 40:33.067
-Is your friend coming over?
-No, no, he's not.

40:33.067 --> 40:35.897
-Is dinner ready yet?
-Did you ask him?

40:35.897 --> 40:37.967
Yeah, Linda, did you ask me?

40:37.967 --> 40:39.368
Who's she talking to?

40:39.368 --> 40:41.437
Fine. Would you like
to come over for dinner?

40:41.437 --> 40:43.237
No, I have plans.

40:43.237 --> 40:44.807
O-Oh, yeah, okay.

40:44.807 --> 40:46.437
Uh, what...
what are those plans?

40:46.447 --> 40:49.288
I was gonna have you come over
so we could eat sushi

40:49.288 --> 40:51.578
off each other's naked bodies.

40:51.588 --> 40:53.087
You know, I could just pick up

40:53.087 --> 40:54.588
an order to go
on my way over there.

40:54.588 --> 40:58.127
Does your mom like tuna rolls
or spicy beef or...

40:58.127 --> 40:59.957
Very funny.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.857
<i>Perhaps that's</i>
<i>the answer he's looking for.</i>

41:02.857 --> 41:05.557
What the fuck?

41:05.567 --> 41:08.438
<i>I'm afraid it'll only fill him</i>
<i>with more loneliness.</i>

41:08.438 --> 41:10.207
-Hello? What's going on?
-Nothing.

41:10.207 --> 41:12.138
-I'll call you back in a minute.
-Merry Christ...

41:17.408 --> 41:20.068
What?! Shit!

41:25.188 --> 41:29.228
Hey, Mike?
Keep your trash off my property!

41:32.228 --> 41:34.128
I'm keeping this!

41:39.928 --> 41:43.998
<i>You will be visited</i>
<i>by three ghosts.</i>

41:48.608 --> 41:51.238
<i>Pure poppycock!</i>

42:00.019 --> 42:01.318
<i>Yes.</i>

42:01.318 --> 42:04.088
<i>Yes, t-that's all</i>
<i>that it is.</i>

42:04.088 --> 42:06.149
<i>This is poppycock.</i>

42:12.269 --> 42:14.969
<i>Perhaps a tonic</i>
<i>will help settle this.</i>

42:26.049 --> 42:27.289
Aah!

43:03.650 --> 43:07.620
How'd you get in here?
Are you Michael's brat?

43:13.360 --> 43:16.190
Would you look
at little Chester?

43:16.200 --> 43:19.230
Aren't you the most adorable
little thing?

43:19.230 --> 43:21.560
Now, sing a Christmas song
for Grandma.

43:21.570 --> 43:25.211
Come on, Chester. Sing a song
for your grandmother.

43:25.211 --> 43:27.110
Anybody care
if I get out of here?

43:27.110 --> 43:29.580
-Honey, it's... it's Christmas.
-Yeah, we opened the presents.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.410
Oh, just let him
go to a bar already.

43:31.410 --> 43:33.211
-He's not gonna go...
-Why don't we all go to a bar?

43:33.211 --> 43:35.441
- Would you two stop?
- Please, sing

43:35.451 --> 43:37.751
See what happens when you
don't do what you're told?

43:37.751 --> 43:39.981
<i>Now sing for Grandma.</i>

43:39.991 --> 43:42.221
<i>Come on, kid, sing!</i>
<i>Now!</i>

43:42.221 --> 43:45.291
<i>Sing the goddamn song.</i>

43:45.291 --> 43:47.391
<i>Honey, language.</i>
<i>Sing.</i>

43:47.401 --> 43:48.760
-Stop it!
<i>-Sing!</i>

43:48.760 --> 43:50.391
Stop it!
Leave me alone!

44:01.141 --> 44:03.041
Fuck. Fuck!

44:04.581 --> 44:07.791
Oh, my God.
Where's my fucking phone?

44:10.151 --> 44:12.111
Um... Um...

44:12.121 --> 44:15.581
I'm calling the cops!
R-Right now!

44:16.722 --> 44:20.521
Yes, Officer,
my home is being invaded!

44:20.531 --> 44:25.071
My address is 2740 Chandler Way!

44:25.071 --> 44:29.172
Oh, you're coming right now
with a SWAT team?!

44:29.172 --> 44:30.531
Thank you, Officer!

44:30.541 --> 44:33.182
You're fucked now!

44:43.222 --> 44:44.492
Fuck.

44:50.792 --> 44:52.621
I've got a gun.

44:52.631 --> 44:55.572
You got three seconds before
I come out shooting!

44:55.572 --> 44:58.762
Chet.

45:09.112 --> 45:11.412
All alone on Christmas, Chet?

45:11.412 --> 45:12.673
What of it?

45:12.683 --> 45:15.083
No, I think it's great.

45:15.083 --> 45:16.482
You got that right.

45:16.482 --> 45:19.553
No stupid decorations,
no annoying friends.

45:19.553 --> 45:22.383
Freeloading family around
to suffocate us.

45:22.393 --> 45:25.493
Hell yeah,
we got this shit beat.

45:26.232 --> 45:27.803
I don't think there's
anywhere else to go.

45:27.803 --> 45:29.303
Wait.

45:29.303 --> 45:30.603
-Yeah.
-What are you talking about?

45:30.603 --> 45:32.773
I think we're done here.

45:32.773 --> 45:36.242
It's been a wonderful
fucking life, bro.

45:36.242 --> 45:37.873
No fucking way!

45:37.873 --> 45:39.403
Then why are you doing that?

45:39.413 --> 45:41.282
Fuck!

45:42.613 --> 45:44.213
Fuck.

45:46.413 --> 45:49.213
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>

45:49.223 --> 45:52.363
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>

45:58.293 --> 46:01.524
You rosy-cheeked son of a bitch.

46:11.644 --> 46:14.144
Okay, I know
I'm a little bit drunk,

46:14.144 --> 46:16.174
but I think this is something
we need to discuss.

46:16.184 --> 46:19.184
Okay, we have been neighbors now
for five years,

46:19.184 --> 46:20.444
and every Christmas, you...

46:21.924 --> 46:23.554
Is that my Santa?

46:23.554 --> 46:25.814
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>

46:25.824 --> 46:28.154
What, are you stealing
my Christmas decorations now?!

46:28.164 --> 46:29.364
No!
No, no, no, no, no.

46:29.364 --> 46:30.864
No, shut up!
I don't want to hear it!

46:30.864 --> 46:33.734
Every year, it's the same
"I hate Christmas" routine.

46:33.734 --> 46:36.304
-Help me.
-Man, let go!

46:36.304 --> 46:38.304
No, I have to show you
something in the bathroom!

46:38.304 --> 46:39.874
What is wrong with you, man?!

46:43.404 --> 46:45.274
Oh, shit.

47:05.395 --> 47:09.725
<i>A sad fate to die all alone</i>
<i>without a friend.</i>

47:09.735 --> 47:11.695
I'm not alone.
I have friends.

47:11.705 --> 47:14.205
<i>There he'll lie to rot away.</i>

47:14.205 --> 47:16.505
Someone'll come by
any minute now.

47:16.505 --> 47:18.935
Linda's probably on her way
over here right now.

47:18.945 --> 47:22.275
<i>But, Chet, she has her family</i>
<i>to keep her company tonight.</i>

47:22.285 --> 47:23.614
She probably started
heading over here

47:23.614 --> 47:25.415
the second I got off
the phone with her.

47:25.415 --> 47:27.715
I'll get some CPR.
I'll be good as fucking new.

47:27.725 --> 47:30.425
And then drinks
and blowjobs later. You'll see.

47:30.425 --> 47:31.760
<i>Oh, yes, of course.</i>

47:31.761 --> 47:34.355
<i>Drinks and blowjobs.</i>
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

47:34.365 --> 47:36.835
<i>Poor deluded bastard.</i>

47:45.936 --> 47:46.935
What are you doing?

47:46.935 --> 47:48.706
No, they'll come.

47:48.706 --> 47:50.766
They'll come.

47:50.776 --> 47:52.775
Stop.
Stop it!

47:52.775 --> 47:55.876
Stop it.
Stop it!

47:55.886 --> 47:57.385
Stop it!
Stop it!

47:57.385 --> 47:58.516
Aaah!

47:58.516 --> 48:00.015
Aaah!

48:00.015 --> 48:02.745
<i>All that's left</i>
<i>is food for the rats.</i>

48:12.696 --> 48:15.026
<i>Oh, I can't watch.</i>

48:17.506 --> 48:18.976
<i>Let me have a look.</i>

48:43.996 --> 48:47.027
Ohh, ohh...

48:47.037 --> 48:48.536
Aah!

48:51.937 --> 48:56.006
I know I am a little bit drunk,
but we need to discuss this.

48:56.006 --> 48:59.077
Okay, we have been neighbors
for five years now,

48:59.077 --> 49:03.376
and every year at Christmas,
you pull the same shit.

49:03.386 --> 49:05.686
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

49:10.956 --> 49:12.057
For your kid.

49:15.367 --> 49:16.437
Merry Christmas.

49:16.437 --> 49:18.757
Merry Christmas.

49:18.767 --> 49:20.397
Merry Christmas!

49:20.397 --> 49:22.797
Merry Christmas!

49:22.807 --> 49:24.537
Whoo!

49:24.537 --> 49:26.697
Merry Christmas!

49:26.707 --> 49:29.537
Whoo!

49:29.547 --> 49:31.847
God, I hate Christmas.

49:34.347 --> 49:35.978
Is that my wreath?

49:39.957 --> 49:41.927
Whoo!

50:15.428 --> 50:17.029
Do you want to?

50:28.768 --> 50:30.698
I have to pee.

50:30.708 --> 50:33.979
Is that too much information
on a first date?

50:33.979 --> 50:36.849
Is this a date?
Should I be asking that?

50:36.849 --> 50:38.488
Just go.

50:39.649 --> 50:42.549
-Go.
-Okay.

50:44.559 --> 50:45.858
Could I get a water?

50:53.158 --> 50:54.459
Thanks.

51:16.049 --> 51:21.079
Don't patronize me.
No, I can't. I'm fine.

51:21.089 --> 51:24.519
Yes, I know it's tonight.

51:24.529 --> 51:26.799
Because I'm out with someone.

51:30.170 --> 51:31.669
-I just...
-Hey.

51:31.669 --> 51:33.500
Is everything all right?

51:33.500 --> 51:35.800
Uh, yeah, I'm just dealing
with some work stuff.

51:37.740 --> 51:39.770
Sorry, I have to take this.

51:39.780 --> 51:42.510
Uh, I'll see you inside?

51:42.510 --> 51:45.740
-Uh, see you there.
-Leave me alone.

52:14.251 --> 52:17.620
-Sorry about that.
-It's all right.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.520
Not a lot of people coming back
from intermission.

52:23.550 --> 52:26.051
-Do you think <i> we</i> could...
-Shh.

53:13.172 --> 53:15.632
<i>...in the middle</i>
<i>of a 24-hour rock block</i>

53:15.642 --> 53:18.781
<i>of all Christmas hits here</i>
<i>in Southern California...</i>

53:42.932 --> 53:44.832
Shit!

53:47.272 --> 53:48.933
God damn it!

53:56.152 --> 53:58.823
Fuck.

56:04.215 --> 56:05.515
Who's there?

56:49.856 --> 56:52.526
Are these the prints?

56:55.136 --> 56:57.366
-Hi.
-Hi.

56:58.336 --> 57:00.806
And I'll take this.

57:12.016 --> 57:14.086
I didn't think you were
coming until tomorrow.

57:14.086 --> 57:17.056
Well, I didn't want to
put this off another day,

57:17.056 --> 57:19.926
so I decided to change
my travel plans.

57:19.926 --> 57:23.056
You, my friend,
should be very flattered.

57:25.266 --> 57:28.467
And plus I couldn't leave you
all alone on Christmas, right?

57:28.467 --> 57:31.407
Who knows that kind of
trouble you'd get into.

57:38.207 --> 57:40.937
Let me have a look.

57:40.947 --> 57:43.577
Some of my favorites.

57:43.577 --> 57:45.146
I guess they're not bad.

57:46.117 --> 57:49.357
Oh, are you expecting someone?

57:49.357 --> 57:50.957
No.

57:52.486 --> 57:54.187
Come on.

57:59.467 --> 58:01.237
[ Bellowing

58:01.237 --> 58:02.967
What was that?

58:02.967 --> 58:04.897
What...

58:08.207 --> 58:10.507
-There's somebody upstairs.
-Well, who is it?

58:10.507 --> 58:12.138
-Who's upstairs?
-I don't know.

58:12.148 --> 58:13.447
What do you mean,
you don't know?

58:13.447 --> 58:15.387
I'm gonna go look.
You stay right here.

59:18.279 --> 59:20.078
No.

59:20.078 --> 59:22.178
No! No!

01:00:03.389 --> 01:00:05.020
Guy?

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.089
Guy?

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:21.239
Guy, what happened in here?

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.500
Sorry.

01:01:58.511 --> 01:01:59.642
Not tonight.

01:02:01.141 --> 01:02:02.402
Not tonight.

01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:06.652
Hello?

01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:08.251
Hey, Steve, where are you?

01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:10.386
-Home.
-Well, are you coming over?

01:02:10.387 --> 01:02:12.782
I told you I can't
go out tonight, Gabby.

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:17.162
Come on, it's Christmas Eve.
You can't spend it alone.

01:02:17.162 --> 01:02:18.732
I have to.

01:03:03.673 --> 01:03:05.203
Gabby!

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:09.442
Dude, let me in.
What are you doing in there?

01:03:09.442 --> 01:03:13.313
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

01:03:16.723 --> 01:03:19.493
We brought Christmas dinner
to you, you grumpy bastard.

01:03:19.493 --> 01:03:20.858
You shouldn't have done that.

01:03:20.859 --> 01:03:22.353
I know we shouldn't
have done it,

01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:25.233
but we're awesome,
so deal with it.

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:26.934
-I'll warm everything up.
-Oh, I'll help.

01:03:26.934 --> 01:03:31.434
-I'll grab the serving dishes.
-I'm gonna make myself a drink.

01:03:31.434 --> 01:03:33.833
How do you not have bitters?

01:03:34.404 --> 01:03:35.503
Whoa!

01:03:36.874 --> 01:03:38.333
What's up?

01:03:41.414 --> 01:03:42.848
We're just gonna talk, right?

01:03:42.849 --> 01:03:45.213
You couldn't have picked
a worse time.

01:03:45.213 --> 01:03:46.814
Okay, listen.

01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:48.584
It started
10 years ago tonight.

01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:50.883
Before that day,
I always celebrated Christmas.

01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:53.253
-But then...
-Hey, guys, dinner's ready.

01:03:55.964 --> 01:03:58.494
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Actually, you know what?

01:03:58.494 --> 01:03:59.894
I need a cigarette
before dinner.

01:03:59.894 --> 01:04:01.324
We'll talk about this later.

01:04:01.334 --> 01:04:02.704
-Gabby!
-Later!

01:04:13.444 --> 01:04:15.375
Oh, that's really weird.

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:19.684
Hey, guys, come check out
this star.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.995
<i>Atomic activity on the moon.</i>

01:04:27.995 --> 01:04:30.530
<i>I never saw anything like them.</i>

01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:32.455
<i>They must be</i>
<i>from another planet.</i>

01:04:32.465 --> 01:04:34.604
<i> You aren't going in</i>
<i>the right direction, Earth man.</i>

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.564
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

01:04:36.564 --> 01:04:38.864
<i>- And leave the ray gun?</i>
<i>- What else can we do?</i>

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:52.445
Oh, I just had
the strangest...

01:04:55.285 --> 01:04:57.615
Oh. I don't remember
bringing all of this.

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.995
Would you like to come in
and eat with us?

01:04:59.995 --> 01:05:03.025
-Sure.
-Would you like to sit here?

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:06.925
It is the only empty chair.

01:05:13.836 --> 01:05:15.765
Should we say a blessing?

01:05:15.775 --> 01:05:17.475
Steve, would you like to?

01:05:17.475 --> 01:05:18.876
I don't know one.

01:05:21.716 --> 01:05:24.316
Gabby, would you?

01:05:24.316 --> 01:05:27.375
Uh, I-I don't
really know one either.

01:05:30.085 --> 01:05:32.056
I have to use the bathroom.

01:05:41.866 --> 01:05:44.596
Do you like Christmas, Gabby?

01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:46.706
Yeah, sure.

01:05:48.036 --> 01:05:51.866
Could you tell us about one
of your own Christmas memories?

01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:59.456
Uh, you guys
are messing with me, right?

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:08.366
Oh, did you guys
get high without...

01:06:10.497 --> 01:06:13.426
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Fuck, Steve!

01:06:16.136 --> 01:06:18.476
Steve, are you still there?

01:06:29.016 --> 01:06:31.086
Oh, my God, Steve,
what have you done?

01:06:31.086 --> 01:06:33.786
Not what you think.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.997
Would you like to join us
for dinner, Steve?

01:06:42.997 --> 01:06:45.097
Looks like <i> you</i> got
invited to the party.

01:06:45.097 --> 01:06:47.727
Oh, my God!

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.767
Oh, my God,
you guys suck so bad.

01:06:50.767 --> 01:06:55.407
Yeah, nice joke.

01:06:56.647 --> 01:06:59.717
Okay, you got me.

01:06:59.717 --> 01:07:02.957
It was a good prank, okay?
Now stop being assholes.

01:07:02.957 --> 01:07:05.447
I got to smoke a cigarette.

01:07:09.028 --> 01:07:11.798
Would you like to join us
for dinner, Gabby?

01:07:11.798 --> 01:07:15.768
Yeah, Gabby, join us for dinner.
Tried to warn you.

01:07:15.768 --> 01:07:19.807
Would you like to sit here
in the only empty chair?

01:07:27.507 --> 01:07:30.538
Would you like to
say a blessing?

01:07:30.548 --> 01:07:31.718
So, what's going on here, Steve?

01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:34.738
Is this, like, group hypnosis?

01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:36.148
Did you get a book on how to

01:07:36.148 --> 01:07:37.547
hypnotize your friends
at dinner parties?

01:07:37.547 --> 01:07:39.048
Would you like to
say a blessing?

01:07:39.058 --> 01:07:41.523
They're not our friends.
They just took on their forms.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.718
What do you mean, "they"?

01:07:42.728 --> 01:07:44.628
Would you like
to say a blessing?

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.968
You had me with the gun thing,
but you kind of lost me with...

01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:48.588
Would you like
to say a blessing?

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:49.899
Jesus Christ, Mary!

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.868
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:08:13.888 --> 01:08:15.249
Would you like eggnog?

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:20.698
Would you like
some m-m-mixed nuts?

01:08:21.868 --> 01:08:24.769
Would you like to help us
decorate a tree?

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:32.499
You're the one who wanted
to spend Christmas with me.

01:08:47.519 --> 01:08:49.219
What the hell do they want?

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:50.790
Not sure.

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:53.089
They just take me up
and ask me questions.

01:08:53.099 --> 01:08:54.764
Have you ever asked them?

01:08:54.765 --> 01:08:56.828
No, Gabby, in 10 years
I've never once asked them

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:58.290
what their end game might be.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.229
Would you like to enjoy
some more sugary foods?

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.939
No, thank you.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:06.010
Would you like to open
your presents now?

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.010
Why are you doing this?

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.810
I forgot to tell you,
they don't really like it

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:14.020
when you ask that question.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.660
I hate it.
I hate it. Okay.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.850
So, what happens now?

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:26.630
We play their game.

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.229
Oh, screw that. I'm gonna
take my chances out there.

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:35.580
Take a seat.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:41.750
Yeah, okay.
Sure.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:46.740
Who wants to g-go first?

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:50.020
Gabby, would you like
to open your present first?

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.060
Okay.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.191
Do you like it?

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:06.661
Yes.

01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:09.911
Steve, would you like
to go next?

01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:11.010
Okay.

01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:24.211
Okay, I'm done now.
C-Can I please go home?

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:26.651
Don't you want to open
your other present?

01:10:38.232 --> 01:10:41.002
You...

01:10:41.002 --> 01:10:43.672
Okay, I'm...
I'm done with this.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.972
Can I just go now?

01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:48.212
-What's wrong, Gabby?
-Don't you like it?

01:10:48.212 --> 01:10:50.172
Isn't it what
you've always wanted?

01:10:50.182 --> 01:10:51.911
Shut up, Mary.

01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:54.681
Why is it so important for Steve
to celebrate Christmas?

01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:56.212
-Why Gabby?
-Why Gabby?

01:10:56.222 --> 01:10:57.922
-Why Gabby?
-Why?

01:10:57.922 --> 01:10:59.922
Because I never
had one, okay?!

01:11:01.092 --> 01:11:03.952
My parents
didn't celebrate Christmas,

01:11:03.962 --> 01:11:09.132
so we never put up a tree
and I never got any presents.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.292
And this...

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:18.802
This was the doll that
I begged for and I never got.

01:11:18.812 --> 01:11:21.182
Why don't you guys go abduct
my parents and ask them

01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:24.883
why they had to be such
assholes every December 25th?

01:11:24.883 --> 01:11:27.283
So now that I'm older,

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:31.212
I hold the holidays
pretty fucking dear to my heart.

01:11:31.222 --> 01:11:35.352
So merry fucking Christmas.
Are you fucking happy?

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:48.162
Ow!

01:12:04.293 --> 01:12:07.963
-Are we back?
-I think so.

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.333
Thought you might want this.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.873
Merry Christmas.

01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:25.464
Hey.
Thanks for calling me.

01:13:25.474 --> 01:13:27.175
I noticed we're both orphans
this holiday,

01:13:27.175 --> 01:13:30.434
so why not
be orphans together?

01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:32.445
Anything beats being alone
on Christmas Eve.

01:13:33.344 --> 01:13:36.375
That sounded awful.
I'm so sorry.

01:13:37.485 --> 01:13:39.045
That's fine.

01:13:45.865 --> 01:13:47.825
Interesting-looking crowd.

01:13:47.825 --> 01:13:49.225
Yeah,
I guess this is what

01:13:49.235 --> 01:13:53.335
the Christmas Eve theater crowd
looks like.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:02.305
-What's wrong? Are you okay?
-I'll... I'll be right back.

01:14:02.315 --> 01:14:04.585
Guess a lot of people aren't
coming back from intermission.

01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:06.405
Max?

01:14:06.415 --> 01:14:09.215
-Do you think we could...
-Shh.

01:14:14.986 --> 01:14:17.516
Sorry.

01:14:17.526 --> 01:14:19.956
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

01:14:22.996 --> 01:14:25.296
I'll be right back.

01:14:31.236 --> 01:14:32.966
Max?

01:14:40.546 --> 01:14:43.216
Are you there?

01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:46.246
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

01:14:47.926 --> 01:14:51.457
I tried.
I thought...

01:14:51.457 --> 01:14:52.956
I thought I could beat it.

01:14:54.966 --> 01:14:59.567
But it's too close now.
It's too late.

01:15:01.437 --> 01:15:04.037
I'm sorry.

01:15:04.037 --> 01:15:06.407
I...

01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:07.906
I have to feed.

01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:28.467
Is it over?

01:15:28.467 --> 01:15:32.467
I'm starving.
How about you?

01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:44.417
Oh, is it over?

01:15:46.487 --> 01:15:49.217
I'm starving.

01:15:52.628 --> 01:15:54.127
How about you?

01:15:56.727 --> 01:15:59.527
Whoa. Hey.

01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:01.187
Are you okay?

01:19:52.332 --> 01:19:57.462
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

01:20:07.252 --> 01:20:09.382
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho!</i>

01:20:09.382 --> 01:20:13.913
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

01:20:14.305 --> 01:20:20.301
