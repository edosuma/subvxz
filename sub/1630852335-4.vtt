So, let's get started with the
beij  .

01:50.810 --> 01:52.744
It's a very easy type of bread.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.114
It's been widely used by
indigenous natives of the amazon

01:56.183 --> 01:57.349

bread alternative in brazil.

the pan?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.625
There's no paste or water or
egg?

02:06.693 --> 02:08.227
You don't use nothing.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.508
[jimmy] yeah.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.442
My grandmother raised me in a
tin shack, literally.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.776
Yeah.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.445
And it's poor people's food,
right?

03:33.513 --> 03:34.579
[jimmy] it is.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.348
[wes] because she would harvest
it, grate it, right...

03:36.416 --> 03:37.549
[jimmy] yeah.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.351
...And then she would make
pudding--cassava pudding

03:39.419 --> 03:40.418
With it.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.519
-[jimmy] that's it.
-And she would sell it.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.387
That's how we would make a
living.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.322
Right.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.589
Cassava is originally from
brazil.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.890
Now we have it all around the
world.

03:45.959 --> 03:46.758

03:46.826 --> 03:47.892
I loved it.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.394
And you definitely get it all
over the caribbean.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.964
So, jimmy, are you a chef, or
why did you wanna bring

03:53.033 --> 03:54.666
This to canada?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.067
That's a big question.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.802
I wanted to move here.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.971
I did own a restaurant in
brazil...

04:00.040 --> 04:01.439
[manjit] okay.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.375
[jimmy]...And I was starting
thinking a business that we

04:03.443 --> 04:07.613
Could do here, and then I saw
this company, beij   foods,

04:07.681 --> 04:10.315
And I ended up making a deal on
the whole of the business.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.553
But at that point, I was without
money, because all the currency

04:15.556 --> 04:17.956
In brazil, it just like dropped.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.424
[manjit] crashed.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.894
So I got an investor, which
sometimes I call her mom also.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.496
-[manjit] okay.
-[chuckles]

04:24.564 --> 04:26.398
And then we are here working
hard since then.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.233
So, jimmy, who owns the
business?

04:28.302 --> 04:29.734
Like, what percentage do you
own?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.470
-It's my mother's.
-So she owns 100%?

04:31.538 --> 04:32.604
[jimmy] yeah.

04:32.672 --> 04:33.672
[michele] that's real love
money.

04:33.740 --> 04:34.906
[vincenzo] it is.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.508
[manjit] how much did she pay
for the business?

04:36.576 --> 04:39.645
So in the end, the whole thing
was $40,000.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.645
$40,000.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.447
We did have some inventory at
that point.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.982
[manjit] how much does this sell
for?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.917
The waffles, we are selling them
for $12.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.520
[manjit] and how much does it
cost you?

04:48.588 --> 04:51.590
$6.50 each pack.

04:51.658 --> 04:55.293
And that's one of the needs for
a partner, is to scale

04:55.296 --> 04:57.562
Production and reduce the
prices,

04:57.630 --> 04:59.764
Especially on the waffles.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.232
I'm doing it by hand.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.568
-I have the waffle makers.
-[manjit] right.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.736
[arlene] yeah.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.971
So how much revenue in total do
you think you'll do?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.807
-[jimmy] this year?
-[wes] yeah.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.176
We would end around $80,000,
$90,000.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.847
But definitely next year, I
would be looking for something

05:15.915 --> 05:19.351
Around $180,000, $200,000
revenue.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.019
-[michele] yeah.
-Interesting.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.054
So when you came to the show...

05:23.123 --> 05:24.689
[jimmy] yeah.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.291
...Did you have already somebody
in mind?

05:27.427 --> 05:29.027
I would say jim, but he's not
here.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.129
-No.
-[laughter]

05:31.197 --> 05:33.565
-Good answer, jimmy!
-[arlene] good answer.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.999
-[michele] the best answer!
-Here's to jim!

05:35.068 --> 05:36.568
[laughter]

05:36.636 --> 05:39.271
[wes] well, jimmy, I love your
immigrant story.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.538
[jimmy] thank you.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.207
And this is a place where dreams
are made.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.410
You just gotta keep on working
hard and keep hustling the way

05:45.478 --> 05:48.146
You are, and you're gonna taste
the canadian dream.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.016
But because of the size of the
business, to me,

05:52.085 --> 05:53.351
It's just too small.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.820
So for that reason, I'm out.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.323
I do believe we can really grow.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.059
We are just scratching the
surface at vancouver.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.095
We have other places that want
to carry us,

06:04.098 --> 06:05.931
But I do think we can go
all over canada.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.199
I'm just not sure where you fit.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.201
Like, it's not quite a health
product, but it's also like a

06:10.204 --> 06:11.736
Bit of an indulgent product.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.737
It's cheese bread.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.039
And then you have to educate the
market.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.274
I think it's a bit of an uphill
battle here.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.776
So, for that reason, I'm gonna
be out.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.378
Yeah.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.915
For me, jimmy, I don't think
you're investible at this stage.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.185
Thank you for choosing canada,
but I'm gonna be out.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.257
[arlene] so, jimmy, I could go
next.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.759
I think your waffle product is a
home run.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.661
I do believe it's a whole new
category of waffle.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.829
-It's something different.
-[arlene] it is.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.233
-Super innovative.
-Thank you.

06:41.301 --> 06:46.104
I'm gonna give you $20,000 for
25%, and I will give you

06:46.106 --> 06:50.708
The $100,000 in a convertible
note, so whatever the next round

06:50.711 --> 06:54.713
We raise at, it'll be a 20%
discount to that, okay?

06:54.781 --> 06:55.914
It's amazing.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.215
I think we can make a lot of
money with that waffle.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.584
-I truly believe.
-[arlene] yeah.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.654
-So that's my offer.
-[jimmy] that's great.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.788
Let's wait.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.190
Mr. Sunshine?

07:07.794 --> 07:10.162
-So I'll make you an offer.
-Whoa.

07:10.864 --> 07:20.505
I'll give you $40,000 for 33%,
but I want you to take $20,000

07:20.507 --> 07:24.175
Of the $40,000, pay back your
mother so that she owns a third,

07:24.178 --> 07:25.677
You own a third, and I own a
third.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.583
And I'll give you the $100,000,
but we're gonna have to up

07:31.651 --> 07:33.418
The royalty because I wanna be
out of there

07:33.486 --> 07:34.986
With that $100,000 quickly.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.722
Call it 10%.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.625
Because I want you to push the
other product, the one that you

07:40.693 --> 07:41.960
Cooked with.

07:42.028 --> 07:42.994
-[jimmy] ah, the beij  .
-[manjit] the beij  .

07:43.062 --> 07:43.928
[vincenzo] the beij  .

07:43.997 --> 07:45.063
This is where the money is for
me.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.931
I don't think the money's in
those waffles.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.633
Then you don't know much what
was going on in grocery.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.934
Of course, I know nothing.

07:50.003 --> 07:50.969
You're the only one who knows
anything.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.304
No, but you're the only one who
knows anything!

07:52.372 --> 07:53.471
[arlene] no, but you don't
know--I'm telling you--

07:53.540 --> 07:54.305
No, but you're the only one who
knows anything!

07:54.308 --> 07:55.507
[wes] come on, children.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.608
-Now, now.
-[arlene] okay, you know.

07:56.676 --> 07:57.775
[manjit] okay, jimmy, you have
two offers.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.544
[wes] jimmy, I think you have a
decision to make.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.745

How much does it take to make

space that I can step into

valuation you're proposing here?

21:15.474 --> 21:16.440
-[manjit] $2 million.
-It's $2 million.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.110
You have $370,000 in sales.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.446
So we took a revenue-based
approach to this.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.115
Looking at reaching a million in
sales next year.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.319
And there is a movement called
the 15% pledge which is major

21:28.387 --> 21:32.256

15% of their shelf space

21:32.258 --> 21:34.191

21:34.259 --> 21:39.296

21:40.632 --> 21:41.532
[michele] right.

wanna bring in.

21:47.573 --> 21:53.143

the people that will dictate

21:53.146 --> 21:56.013
The shelf space you'll get is
the customer.

21:56.082 --> 21:59.283

22:04.290 --> 22:05.556

listen, as a check marking a lot

22:21.374 --> 22:24.875

if there's anything that can get

22:24.943 --> 22:27.645
Your foot in the door first,
take it.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.281
And then in the end, prove why
you should be there,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.316
And then just blow it up.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.217

the battle you're about to go

25:35.901 --> 25:38.235
A cat-lover from toronto who
thinks he has the perfect

25:38.237 --> 25:40.170
Opportunity for a dragon
investment.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.440
-[manjit] kitty cat.
-[vincenzo] oh my god.

25:43.442 --> 25:47.645
-[michele] we got a kitten.
-[mikey] meow-dy, dragons.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.846
My name's mikey 5 bucks.

25:48.914 --> 25:49.913
This my kitty, evil.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.448
And we're coming in hot from
parkdale, toronto.

25:53.185 --> 25:58.255
And we're here seeking $50,005
for 20% of our company:

25:58.323 --> 25:59.590
Catnip dispensary incorporated.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.593
-[manjit] $50,005?
-[michele] $50,000 and what?

26:02.595 --> 26:04.428
-[mikey] yeah, $50,005.
-[manjit] okay.

26:04.496 --> 26:08.332
-[mikey] or--oh no, sabotage.
-[manjit] for 20%, perfect.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.067
[mikey] yeah.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.602
Meow, I'm what you would call a
crazy cat person.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.605
-My apartment is--
-you said it, not us.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.374
-[mikey] yeah, fair enough.
-And you don't have shoes on.

26:17.442 --> 26:18.408
[mikey] uh, no.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.377
We can get into that later,
I'm sure.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.679
-[michele] okay.
-Okay.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.880
So I always pop into different
pet stores, and it always leads

26:23.883 --> 26:26.016
Me into the catnip section.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.252
Now, one thing that I found with
catnip is that every company

26:29.321 --> 26:31.154
Pretty much has one type of
catnip.

26:31.157 --> 26:34.091
So, I thought maybe there was
different strains out there that

26:34.159 --> 26:36.226
Have different effects with
cats.

26:36.294 --> 26:38.028
So I started collecting
different strains of catnip from

26:38.030 --> 26:41.665
All over the world and testing
them out on all my friends' cat.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.333
[wes] friends' cats.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.968
Did your friends know that you
were testing them out

26:44.971 --> 26:45.869
On their cats?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.037
-[mikey] oh, absolutely, yeah.
-Oh, nice.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.939
-This is catnip here.
-Consent is important.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.408
Let's see, like a lemon catnip
from the uk.

26:51.476 --> 26:54.445
Here's a hungarian cat-mint.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.247
-Here's a japanese cat-mint.
-Oh.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.249
So they all have different
effects, which is absolutely

26:59.317 --> 27:00.985
Amazing so--

27:01.053 --> 27:02.519
I think evil needs some energy
right now.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.054
[mikey] oh yeah, we can
definitely get into that.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.489
[michele] evil is really
chill.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.591
-[mikey] yeah.
-I have a video cued up here.

27:07.659 --> 27:08.725
[manjit] sure.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.460
[mikey] so you can see I have
cativas for energy.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.962
[michele] oh my god, like
sativas.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.563
[manjit] instead of sativa.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.399
[mikey] yeah, so we have freddy
puurcury if you want nice stage

27:15.467 --> 27:16.333
Presence for your kitty.

27:16.401 --> 27:17.534
[michele and manjit] okay.

27:17.602 --> 27:21.238
[mikey] we also have meower
diesel which is our heaviest

27:21.306 --> 27:22.939
Cativa, so it's strong.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.008
Get the laser pointer ready.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.275
Your cat's going to be flying on
this stuff.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.610
[manjit] oh my god.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.446
[mikey] now for the more mellow,
we have critical mouse.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.616
Our cats sometimes need to shut
off because they got pretty

27:32.618 --> 27:33.717
Busy lives.

27:33.719 --> 27:34.852
[michele] yeah.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.752
[mikey] fuzz aldrin, so get a
little bit of ups,

27:35.821 --> 27:37.187
A little bit of down.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.222
-This is so funny.
-[mikey] right?

27:39.225 --> 27:41.191
-Or not.
-[wes] so do they get high?

27:41.259 --> 27:42.559
-Oh yeah, yeah.
-[wes] oh, they do?

27:42.628 --> 27:43.860
[mikey] yeah.

27:43.929 --> 27:47.864
Meow, beside you, you'll notice
some of my products there.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.634
And I'll meow answer any
questions that you have.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.904
-[michele] okay.
-So what is catnip?

27:53.906 --> 27:56.573
[mikey] catnip is this plant
right here.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.175
[evil purrs]

27:58.243 --> 28:00.077
It's in the mint family, and it
produces nepatalactone,

28:00.145 --> 28:01.578
Which is the essential oil.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.615
So when they breathe it in, it
creates a stoned-like sensation.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.517
So is that something that the
owner would give the cat

28:07.586 --> 28:08.652
Like regularly?

28:08.721 --> 28:09.720
You can.

28:09.788 --> 28:11.388
It's whenever you wanna spoil
them as well too.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.723
[arlene] it's like a treat
almost.

28:12.725 --> 28:13.990
-[wes] oh, a treat.
-[mikey] yeah, exactly.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.193
Mikey, before we go any further
in this pitch...

28:16.261 --> 28:18.161
-[mikey] yeah.
-...Okay, I have to ask...

28:18.230 --> 28:20.330
-Absolutely.
-...What's up with the beard?

28:20.398 --> 28:23.400
Okay, so for pretty much the
last 15 years, I've pretty much

28:23.469 --> 28:25.269
Done anything for $5, just as a
side gig.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.607
I was getting paid $5 a week to
grow a beard in the first place.

28:30.675 --> 28:33.343
Someone else said, "I'll give
you $5 if you last a week

28:33.345 --> 28:34.544
With it half-shaved."

28:34.547 --> 28:36.814
And then it turned to $5 to have
half your body shaved.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.148
-[arlene] oh my god.
-[wes] mikey, only $5?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.183
-[mikey] yeah.
-[arlene] wait, what else?

28:39.251 --> 28:40.417
[wes] good going.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.120
Oh, you know go out and do your
pitch on<i> dragons' den</i>

28:43.122 --> 28:44.287
In bare feet.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.889
See how many times you can say
"meow" in your pitch.

28:45.958 --> 28:46.690
Oh, so this is a bet?

28:46.759 --> 28:47.758
A $5 bet to come without shoes?

28:47.826 --> 28:48.592
Absolutely.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.660
Yeah, I'm always doing it.

28:49.662 --> 28:52.162
So how much did you make just
for this pitch?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.163
-$20.
-[arlene] $20.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.132
Yeah.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.099
$5 has been very good to you
your whole life,

28:56.168 --> 28:57.267
So you're just going
to continue on.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.836
Absolutely, I ended up here
because of it.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.139
Do you have a physical location
or is this all e-commerce?

29:02.207 --> 29:04.307
This is all out of my bachelor
apartment.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.509
[arlene] oh, out of your
apartment, okay.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.311
So I just did a kickstarter, and
I just took the lid off

29:08.314 --> 29:10.580
Of this three months ago, all
right, so--

29:10.583 --> 29:12.616
How much did you do on your
kickstarter?

29:12.684 --> 29:16.386
I asked for $5,200, and I got
$13,102...

29:16.454 --> 29:17.654
-What?
-Whoa!

29:17.722 --> 29:18.855
-[wes] no way!
-[michele] are you kidding?

29:18.858 --> 29:20.590
[mikey]...And it just went like
crazy.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.460
Sorry, you have to understand
that $13,000 is more than many

29:23.462 --> 29:24.528
Early stage entrepreneurs come
on here.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.062
-[wes] yes.
-[mikey] yeah.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.031
So I even priced it really
aggressively,

29:28.099 --> 29:29.800
Because I don't
have too, too much.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.268
I'm trying to get a facility
right now.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.402
And so what is aggressive?

29:32.404 --> 29:33.804
How much does one of these
little pouches cost?

29:33.806 --> 29:35.072
And how much are you selling it
for?

29:35.140 --> 29:37.374
[mikey] so I tested out
different levels of it,

29:37.442 --> 29:40.511
So I was even selling, you know,
one bag for $25, one for $35...

29:40.579 --> 29:42.279
-Oh, wow.
-[mikey]...One for $45.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.214
-[michele] what?
-That's expensive.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.850
I mean, I had to, you know, move
forward somehow, right?

29:46.918 --> 29:48.285
[michele] yeah, right meow.

29:48.353 --> 29:51.121
So it cost me about 15 cents for
one of those because I'm doing

29:51.189 --> 29:52.222
All the work.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.089
Oh, right.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.758
So you're at 100% margin
effectively.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.926
Yeah.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.761
This is like a wolf in sheep's
clothing.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.363
You're like a joke, but you
actually know how to run

29:59.431 --> 30:00.330
A business.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.865
Thank you, I appreciate that.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.633
And so have you delivered
$13,000 worth of product?

30:03.702 --> 30:05.569
Yesterday I did the rest of it,
yeah.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.703
I shipped the rest out of my
apartment.

30:06.772 --> 30:07.937
[wes] wow.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.673
Your kickstarter closed four
days ago, I just checked.

30:09.741 --> 30:10.974
And you've already delivered the
product?

30:11.043 --> 30:13.009
Yeah.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.145
Tell me, what did you do before
this?

30:15.213 --> 30:16.313
Like, I mean--

30:16.381 --> 30:18.015
Yeah, I was working at an animal
hospital, and then I'd be

30:18.083 --> 30:21.718
Working festivals, then I'd get
picked up by a sideshow,

30:21.786 --> 30:23.620
And then bands would pick me up
to entertain their guests as

30:23.688 --> 30:26.056
They would come in and then--and
it just--I don't know,

30:26.124 --> 30:27.958
Just it's been a
pretty crazy ride.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.392
[michele] yeah.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.428
This is a better business than
most.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.362
Oh.

30:32.430 --> 30:33.330
[michele] this is 100% margin...

30:33.332 --> 30:34.531
Mm hmm.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.433
...And this is probably some of
the most brilliant marketing

30:36.501 --> 30:37.567
We've seen.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.436
[mikey] oh, thank you.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.271
But this is a good business for
you.

30:41.273 --> 30:44.608
Not good for me as an investor,
so I'm gonna be out.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.509
For meow.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.776
-For meow.
-Yeah, for meow.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.215
So every pitch that comes,
one of the questions that I ask

30:51.283 --> 30:52.216
Myself is:

30:53.419 --> 30:55.919
In the event something were to
happen to

30:55.987 --> 30:57.187
This exceptional
individual...

30:57.189 --> 30:58.588
-[mikey] mm hmm.
-...How do I replace them?

30:58.657 --> 31:00.790
-How do I go on without them?
-Right.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.628
[vincenzo] so truth of the
matter is I'm having a hard time

31:04.696 --> 31:05.829
Finding a replacement for you.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.163
-[laughter]
-it's not possible.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.698
[michele] it is not possible.

31:08.701 --> 31:12.536
He now becomes the genius that I
have to protect.

31:12.604 --> 31:13.870
I'm still here though.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.372
And only for that reason,
I'm gonna be out.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.076
-Okay.
-[evil meows]

31:20.545 --> 31:22.712
So for me, I think you're an
evil genius.

31:22.781 --> 31:24.514
Much appreciated.

31:24.582 --> 31:27.350
I'm not quite sure if somebody
bet you $5 and you're gonna go

31:27.419 --> 31:28.485
Focus on something else.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.388
You know, you put something in
front of a cat and they just

31:31.456 --> 31:33.390
Jump at it.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.058
Mm hmm.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.826
[wes] so as they would say in
jamaica, meowt.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.828
-[arlene] oh, meowt.
-Okay, awesome.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.730
[michele] oh, that's cute.

31:40.733 --> 31:44.334
Mikey, I'm sorry but this just
is not purrrfect for me.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.236
-[laughter]
-[mikey] no worries.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.506
-[arlene] oh mikey.
-Hi.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.274
[arlene] hi.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.110
I have to say, I love your
approach to life in general.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.211
Thank you.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.346
I can't see it scaling as an
investment...

31:56.348 --> 31:57.614
[mikey] okay.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.316
...But I hope you knock it out
of the park and make yourself

31:59.384 --> 32:01.885
A small fortune.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.219
Awesome, I appreciate that.

32:03.288 --> 32:06.222
[arlene] I'm gonna be out,
but wow, it's a first.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.958
-[manjit] yeah.
-Well, thank you for your time.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.694
-Bye mikey, thanks for coming.
-[michele] lovely to meet you.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.728
[mikey] thank you very much.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.196
-Say "bye", evil.
-[dragons] bye evil.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.398
-[wes] all right, evil.
-[michele] bye mikey.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.700
[mikey] see ya.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.702
Despite all the cat calls,
he took it well.

More and more everyday is

36:45.703 --> 36:47.437

36:47.505 --> 36:49.573
That statement today is--I wanna
show you something.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.143
The same bottle that arlene
used.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.079
The proof is in the pudding,
right?

36:56.147 --> 36:57.046
You're gonna drink it.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.114
[manjit] oh my goodness, don't!

36:58.182 --> 36:58.982
-No, don't drink it!
-Oh my god, don't drink it!

36:59.050 --> 37:00.182
-[wes] terry, don't do it!
-Oh my god!

-Terry, we gotta talk, man.
-No, this is what it is.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.722

product.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.790
Oh my god.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.959
[terry] to make that statement,
you gotta prove it.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.527
So basically, I'm willing to
back up.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.396
I advise nobody to ever drink a
cleaning product.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.465
-[manjit] okay.
-[wes] please do not.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.133

37:18.337 --> 37:19.302

-Really?

37:27.645 --> 37:28.478
[manjit] wow.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.479

37:29.547 --> 37:30.980
Like, this is truly unique to
the market.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.816
This didn't happen overnight.

37:32.884 --> 37:37.220

different generations to prove

37:37.288 --> 37:38.688
That it worked.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.491
And even the chemist says,
"what's in that bottle shouldn't

37:41.559 --> 37:42.892
Do that."

37:42.894 --> 37:44.961
-Wow.
-And who owns the formula then?

37:45.030 --> 37:46.129
I do 100%, yeah.

37:46.197 --> 37:46.963
[arlene] you do, you own it all?

37:47.032 --> 37:48.297
Yeah.

37:48.299 --> 37:49.299
[manjit] there's a lot of
cleaners on the market that

37:49.367 --> 37:51.534

eco-friendly, safe...

37:51.536 --> 37:52.402
[terry] yeah.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.572
[manjit]..And so on a shelf,
how do you educate your consumer

37:56.575 --> 37:57.774
That this works better?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.008

38:08.153 --> 38:10.887

be, I worked in the industrial

38:10.955 --> 38:12.589
Space my whole life.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.223
I work for a company called
pratt & whitney.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.392
-Mm hmm.
-Like my dad!

38:15.460 --> 38:16.859

in common, vince.

38:16.928 --> 38:17.893
-We're part of an alumni.
-Yeah, my dad was a machinist.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.295
-That was his first job.
-[terry] same as me.

38:19.364 --> 38:24.500
So fast-forward, I get in the
business selling machine tools,

38:24.569 --> 38:25.802
And then covid hit.

38:25.870 --> 38:29.739
And we were selling three, four
machines a week.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.207
-We went to zero in a hurry.
-Wow.

38:31.275 --> 38:32.208
[michele] wow.

38:32.277 --> 38:35.244
And we closed offices, laid off
staff and--

38:35.313 --> 38:36.579
So tough.

38:36.581 --> 38:37.847
And I was getting more and more
depressed because it was only

38:37.849 --> 38:38.815
Going to last a month...

38:38.883 --> 38:40.082
[arlene] yeah, true.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.351
...And then it was three months
and then it was four months.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.986
And finally, my wife's turning
around, kicked me square in the

38:43.989 --> 38:46.689
Rear, and said, "you've always
figured it out,

38:46.758 --> 38:47.957
Go do something."

38:48.025 --> 38:49.092
-Oh, good for her.
-[michele laughs]

38:49.160 --> 38:51.527
The evolution started at that
point.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.263
But what used to marvel me as a
machinist, we would take

38:54.332 --> 38:57.167
The parts off the machine, go
over to these dunk tanks,

38:57.235 --> 39:00.236
Right to our elbows in varsol,
and our hands were

39:00.304 --> 39:01.471
Breaking out steady.

39:01.539 --> 39:02.905
And I'm sure your dad can attest
to that.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.707
-Yeah, my dad--yeah.
-[terry] it was hard on us.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.843

like this on the market

39:06.845 --> 39:09.045
At that time.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.247

39:48.753 --> 39:49.952
I felt hopeless.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.988
Your story is the story of so
many entrepreneurs in canada

39:52.056 --> 39:53.523
Who've struggled through covid.

39:54.593 --> 39:55.725
[terry] I'm doing it the hard
way.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.927
-[arlene] yeah.
-[terry] I'm mowing doors down.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.662
I don't have the contacts, I
don't have the rolodex,

39:59.730 --> 40:01.064
But I'm making them.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.400
I have two retailers right now,
one with 1,100 stores,

40:04.469 --> 40:07.704
One with 500 stores that I have
verbals for national rollout.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.440
It's not reflected in my
valuation because we're not here

40:10.508 --> 40:12.242
To sell futures.

40:12.310 --> 40:15.445
As you see in my valuation,
I'm not here for the money.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.913
-It's not about money--
-so how much have you sold?

40:16.981 --> 40:19.682
So in four months, what's done
is $82,000.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.716
In four months?

40:20.785 --> 40:22.385
And the first product that we'd
come up with was

40:22.454 --> 40:24.253
The industrial grade.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.922
And the reason I went down that
road was because--like,

40:25.990 --> 40:29.659
I sold to gm, ford, pratt's a
big customer of ours--knowing

40:29.727 --> 40:31.594
I could just call on the people
I already sell to and hit

40:31.663 --> 40:32.829
The ground running.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.030
-Which we did.
-[manjit] okay.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.199
[terry] we launched on amazon
three weeks ago,

40:36.267 --> 40:38.868
And we were ranked number one of
the 100 top new releases, so.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.203
-[arlene] awesome.
-It's pretty cool, right?

40:40.205 --> 40:41.871
-[arlene] yeah, it's very cool.
-Yeah.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.675
So, terry, you saying that, you
know, and I do agree with you,

40:45.743 --> 40:48.244
You're not here for the money,
there's no question about that,

40:48.313 --> 40:50.780
But I think what you're saying
to us, that you want us.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.681
I want a mentor.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.617

propose something here

you were telling me the story,

When you were at pratt &
whitney, it brought me back to

heard my dad trying to explain

41:44.936 --> 41:48.271
