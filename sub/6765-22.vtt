00:02.335 --> 00:04.671
(phone ringing)

00:07.006 --> 00:07.841
Hello.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.635
Hi, uh, Mrs. Pruit,
it's Valerie again.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.929
Um, has Ray gotten back, yet?

00:13.012 --> 00:14.180
Oh, hi, Valerie.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.098
Hi.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.434
{\an1}I think you may've
just missed him, honey.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.476
Just let me check.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.227
Thank you.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.104
You sure picked yourself
a doozy.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.689
Just tell her I'm not home.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.443
Sorry, honey,
he just pulled out.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.778
Has he been getting my messages?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.113
Every last one.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.281
(knock at door)

00:31.364 --> 00:32.991
Hold on just a second.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.452
Can you tell him that I called

00:35.535 --> 00:37.912
and it's very important
that he gets back to me?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.956
I sure will.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.002
(sighs)

00:50.550 --> 00:52.802
Mr. Sanders,
come on in.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.928
Hello, Val.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.513
Why don't you call me Rush?

00:55.597 --> 00:59.642
Okay, Rush, come on in.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.230
{\an1}Wow, quite a dorm
you got here.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.982
Thank you.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.025
Can I offer you a drink?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.026
Whatever you're having.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.652
{\an1}Shirley Temple?
Hardly.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.862
(both chuckle)

01:10.945 --> 01:12.322
{\an1}Okay, I'll have a scotch
on the rocks.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.574
Coming right up.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.954
{\an1}Well, tell me,
what's on your mind?

01:20.038 --> 01:23.374
{\an3}I just thought we ought
to get to know each other

01:23.458 --> 01:24.125
a little better.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.252
Really?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.004
For what possible reason?

01:28.087 --> 01:30.381
Does there have
to be a reason?

01:32.258 --> 01:35.345
Valerie, honey, I'm old enough
to be your father.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.014
And I'm sure a young lady
like you doesn't get too lonely

01:38.097 --> 01:39.224
on cold winter nights.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.562
Okay,
I'll be honest with you.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.315
You have something I want.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.943
Ah, what is that?

01:50.026 --> 01:51.986
The Peach Pit After Dark.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.113
{\an3}I want to take it
off your hands.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.575
You?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.871
(laughing)

02:01.955 --> 02:03.164
I'm sorry, it's not for sale.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.041
Oh, come on.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.709
{\an3}I've heard everything
is for sale.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.669
Is that so?

02:11.131 --> 02:14.884
Actually, everything
is negotiable.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.761
Okay...

02:18.137 --> 02:21.224
then let's negotiate.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.208
How much further?

04:10.291 --> 04:12.835
{\an3}Why are you asking me
so many fool questions?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.379
Don't you trust me?

04:14.462 --> 04:16.339
GIRL:
Shh, they're here.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.841
{\an5}Is that Donna's voice
I just heard?
Yes, it is.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.345
ALL:
Surprise!

04:22.428 --> 04:23.346
What's going on here?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.222
{\an1}Well, just
a little party

04:24.305 --> 04:25.056
to welcome you back
to the real world.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.266
{\an1}Yeah, we thought
we'd lost you forever.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.851
Yeah, you almost did.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.729
{\an1}But never underestimate
the power of love.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.647
{\an3}Uh-oh.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.357
Welcome back, Kel.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.193
{\an1}I should be saying
the same thing to you.

04:37.276 --> 04:40.071
{\an4}It's been a long time
since you've set foot
on this campus.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.198
Yeah, it must've been
a different lifetime.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.742
{\an1}KELLY:
I'm glad you're here.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.245
{\an3}Me, too.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.205
Come on, guys, let's eat up.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.873
{\an1}We gotta get back
to class.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.252
{\an1}Well, I hate to not eat
and run, but I got to go.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.379
{\an3}Donna, Donna, Kelly
just got here.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.714
Sorry, Kel.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
I told Ray I'd meet him
at the club

04:59.298 --> 05:01.300
to have a quick sound check--
catch you at home?

05:01.384 --> 05:04.429
Okay.
Thanks, for everything.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.888
You know what, Donna?

05:05.972 --> 05:06.931
I need a ride somewhere.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.057
{\an3}Can you take me?
Let's go.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.350
{\an1}Thanks.
Later, Chief.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.021
{\an6}I think Donna's
joined her own cult,
the Ray Pruit Society.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.856
David, did you leave your bike
parked on the rack at the dorm?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.274
{\an3}No, ma'am, I don't
own a bike.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.860
Lucky for you, 'cause no one
else does now either.

05:18.943 --> 05:19.736
What happened?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.112
Someone stole four bikes
this morning,

05:21.195 --> 05:22.739
including mine,
a brand new Lite Speed.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.906
STEVE:
Ouch.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.533
{\an5}WOMAN:
Whoever it was knew
what they were after.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.743
Took all the good ones
and left the junk.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.370
Did you tell campus security?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.247
Like that's gonna do any good.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.249
Talking to campus security is
like dealing with Barney Fife.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.417
(laughs)

05:34.500 --> 05:36.377
{\an3}Better watch out,
Mr. President.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.920
{\an3}They're gonna say
you're soft on crime.

05:39.630 --> 05:44.427
{\an3}The only thing around here
I'm soft on is you.

05:45.011 --> 05:45.887
{\an1}Oh...
Aw...

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
{\an3}Don't you believe
in knocking?

06:06.365 --> 06:08.493
{\an1}Don't you believe
in returning phone calls?

06:08.576 --> 06:09.952
Don't take it personally, Val.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.579
How am I supposed
to take it, Ray?

06:11.662 --> 06:13.790
Luckily, I have
a forgiving nature

06:13.873 --> 06:15.500
and a positive mental attitude.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.294
Why don't you take your positive
mental attitude out the door?

06:18.377 --> 06:20.588
You know, you're really burying
yourself, Ray.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.756
Oh, is that what I'm doing?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.425
It would be in your best
interest to start treating me

06:24.509 --> 06:25.468
with a little more respect.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.542
No.
Hmm.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.050
{\an1}I know you guys must
have a million questions.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.176
I would have told you sooner,

11:17.259 --> 11:19.095
but it all came down
so suddenly.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.429
Isn't it great?!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.431
{\an1}What do you know about
running a nightclub, Val?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.599
{\an1}VALERIE:
Not a thing, but...

11:23.682 --> 11:25.476
I'm willing to work hard
and learn.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.602
And that's a start, right?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.771
Well, I think it's terrific.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.564
I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.565
Thanks, Donna.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.775
I knew I could count on you.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.959
(knocking)

11:52.002 --> 11:54.213
(knocking continues)

11:54.296 --> 11:56.298
DYLAN:
Hold on.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.266
What?

12:05.349 --> 12:06.976
I want to celebrate.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.227
Celebrate what?

12:09.311 --> 12:11.647
I just made an acquisition.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.941
(sighs)
What did you acquire?

12:14.024 --> 12:17.153
Hmm?
I bought Steve's father's share

12:17.236 --> 12:19.155
of the Peach Pit After Dark.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.115
So now I know you're crazy.
Come on.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.826
{\an3}Go.
Well, it runs in the family.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.328
But look what I scored.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.457
Fresh... Humboldt County pot.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.292
Oh, take a whiff of that.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.294
Yeah, no thanks.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.628
Come on, Dylan.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.505
Let's smoke ourselves silly

12:36.589 --> 12:37.673
and make love all night.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.342
You're already silly, I'll pass.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.052
On me or the pot?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.345
Both.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.305
What's gotten into you?

12:46.098 --> 12:49.143
Oh, that's right.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.145
You're stuck on Kelly.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.190
But you have to admit,
I'm not bad for backup.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.691
Good night, Val.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.651
Come on, Dylan.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.195
Don't make me go.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.362
I feel so good.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.989
I just want to share it
with somebody.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.074
Somebody else.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.660
I don't have anybody else.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.747
Are you telling me
it's lonely at the top?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.627
Okay, I get the message.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.170
I'll go.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.674
Sleep tight.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.770
It definitely looks
like Beverly Hills

13:32.853 --> 13:34.063
has gone to our
Valerie's head.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.606
{\an1}Maybe she's just
lost her mind.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.316
Maybe we should call Abby.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.235
I don't think
Abby swings much weight

13:39.318 --> 13:40.694
with her daughter
these days, Mom.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.905
Well, I'm sure
you're right, but...

13:42.988 --> 13:44.532
I mean, with all that money,

13:44.615 --> 13:46.325
you'd think she'd send some
of it home to her family.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.580
We should do something.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.083
Well, honey, it's her money,
she's on her own.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
I don't think
there's much we can do.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.378
I know.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.088
I don't just want to see her
get in any trouble.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.714
{\an6}Believe me,
first sign of trouble,
(ringing)

14:00.798 --> 14:02.925
she'll be on our porch faster
than you can snap

14:03.008 --> 14:04.843
your fingers.
Yeah.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.096
Hello?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.305
Brandon.
Oh, hey, Steve.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.100
We were just talking about
your best friend, Miss Valerie.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.601
Don't go there, Brandon.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.727
You talk to your dad?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.604
Yeah, I spoke to him.
We're going to have lunch today.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.772
But that's not the reason
I'm calling.

14:16.855 --> 14:17.606
What's going on?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.108
Well, I hate to ruin
your morning,

14:19.191 --> 14:20.442
but I thought you should know.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.944
Three frat houses
got hit last night.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.237
So why are you telling me?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.655
You're the president.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.907
You're supposed to do something
about this crime wave.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.909
Well, what am I supposed to do?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.411
Call out the National Guard?

14:30.494 --> 14:31.870
Hey, pal, you're the one

14:31.954 --> 14:33.789
who's supposed to have
the answers, not me.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.255
(ominous music plays)

15:01.358 --> 15:03.110
{\an1}What time did Valerie
say to meet her?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.487
{\an3}Hmm, 11:00.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.281
Why? Is that a problem?

15:07.364 --> 15:08.616
No, I can make it.

15:08.699 --> 15:09.950
{\an1}I just can't imagine
what it's going to be like

15:10.034 --> 15:11.827
booking bands with her.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.662
{\an3}If we can work
with Rush Sanders,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.832
{\an3}I think we can probably
work with anyone.

15:16.915 --> 15:18.542
{\an3}Bye.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.674
(gasps)

15:25.758 --> 15:26.967
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.636
I just wanted
to return David's notes.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.512
Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.931
{\an4}CLARE:
Yeah, actually
I was just leaving.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.892
Not on account
of me, I hope.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.352
I have a class.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.686
Don't flatter yourself.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.525
{\an3}Your girlfriend sure goes
out of her way to avoid me.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.860
{\an1}Oh, no, don't worry
about it, man.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.528
{\an1}She's just not
a morning person.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.780
Eh, it's okay.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.531
It's not like she's the only one
around here who doesn't like me.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.866
Come on, what are you
talking about?

15:50.949 --> 15:52.076
Come on, David.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.744
Compared to all you guys,
I'm an old man.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.373
You know, I don't understand
why you moved in the dorms.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
I would've figured you
for, uh...

15:59.124 --> 16:00.376
I don't know,
apartment off campus

16:00.459 --> 16:02.753
{\an1}or something?
Can't afford it.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.046
But you were in the army.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.547
Don't you get any GI benefits

16:05.631 --> 16:06.882
{\an1}or anything?
No.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.717
Why not?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.512
It's a long story.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.596
The upshot is,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.599
I've got to beg, borrow
and steal to make ends meet.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.810
Yeah, well, I wouldn't say that
too loud around here

16:17.893 --> 16:19.228
with all those bikes missing.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.271
What kind of a crack is that?

16:21.355 --> 16:23.357
It was just a joke.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.692
Well, it's not funny.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.572
Lenny, I was,
I was just kidding.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.074
Yeah, right.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
JESSE:
<i>Oh, yeah? How's Hannah?</i>

16:39.957 --> 16:41.166
Finally asleep.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.376
I thought I'd never
get her down for a nap.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.795
Jesse, she has been like this
ever since you left town.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.089
And how about her mom?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.382
{\an1}You having trouble
sleeping, too?

16:48.465 --> 16:49.299
Me, definitely.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.386
I toss and turn all night long.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.138
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better,

16:54.221 --> 16:57.433
given how great my interview
went with Judge Costello today,

16:57.516 --> 16:59.309
it looks like Boise
may be out of the running.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.770
Jesse, I hate
to break it to you,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.440
but Kansas City doesn't sound
much more thrilling than Boise.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.191
Well, the steaks are great.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.402
And when was the last time
you saw me eat red meat?

17:08.484 --> 17:10.154
(knock at door)

17:10.237 --> 17:11.696
Somebody's at the door, hold on.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.075
Surprise.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.743
Shh!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.244
Who's that?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.913
{\an3}Uh, it's, uh,
my grandmother.

17:19.997 --> 17:20.998
Grandmother?

17:21.080 --> 17:22.374
Oh, give her my love, would you?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.334
{\an1}Jesse sends
his love, Grandma.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.752
You know what, honey?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.422
{\an1}Um, maybe I should
call you back.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
Uh, you know what? I'm going
to be running around all day.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.843
Why don't I give you a call
before I go to bed, all right?

17:32.926 --> 17:34.803
{\an1}Great.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.971
I love you.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.306
Yeah, and me, too.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.600
Bye.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.101
Hubby in Boise again?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.644
No, Kansas City.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.022
Oh, well, I hear everything's
up to date there.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.441
Peter, I asked you
not to come by here.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.318
What if-- what if Jesse
were here?

17:49.401 --> 17:50.986
Or my parents
or my grandmother?

17:51.069 --> 17:53.489
Wait a minute, I thought I was
your grandmother.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.409
Look, stop kidding around, okay?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.244
I mean, this thing makes me
just too nervous.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.829
You've got to go.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.831
I will. I promise.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.166
Just not yet.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.835
(Andrea laughs)

18:06.919 --> 18:09.797
Mm...

18:12.925 --> 18:15.177
Oh, I must be crazy.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.930
{\an1}My daughter's sleeping
in the next room.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.265
You're not crazy.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.850
You just can't keep
your hands off me.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.727
(chuckles)

18:23.811 --> 18:26.188
What are we going to do?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.190
{\an3}We'll figure
something out.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.399
You're working
tonight, right?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.360
Yes, 5:00 to 7:00,

18:31.443 --> 18:34.071
{\an1}and you better behave
yourself, promise?

18:34.154 --> 18:36.824
{\an3}Sorry, that I
cannot promise.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.283
Come here.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.379
Hey, Nat.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.255
You seen your new
partner around?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.216
Yeah, she's next door,
redecorating.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.551
She doesn't waste any time, huh?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.928
{\an3}(laughing)

18:58.971 --> 19:00.556
{\an3}Tell her to bring
back my hammer.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.724
{\an1}Will do.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.435
It <i> is</i> my hammer.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.570
Installing a new
dart board, huh?

19:14.653 --> 19:16.238
{\an1}First big
management decision?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.282
Yeah.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.242
What do you think?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.660
{\an1}Well, I can think
of a few faces

19:21.743 --> 19:23.370
{\an1}I wouldn't mind
pinning up there.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.666
Be my guest.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.252
{\an1}So my mother said
you called.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.296
Lordy have mercy.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.715
{\an3}She finally gave you
a message, huh?

19:34.798 --> 19:36.300
{\an1}What do you want,
Valerie?

19:37.885 --> 19:40.429
{\an3}We have some unfinished
business to discuss.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.556
{\an1}I think I already
know the terms.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.765
I'm not interested.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.226
Look, Ray,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.770
{\an3}personally, I'd
like nothing better

19:48.854 --> 19:50.272
{\an3}than for you to continue
playing here.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.608
Said the spider to the fly.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.068
Is my web so unpleasant?

19:57.070 --> 19:59.197
What's the matter, Ray?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.617
I mean, don't you
like the success?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.453
{\an3}Hundreds of adoring
fans out in the crowd.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.582
{\an3}And that one, especially one
adoring fan backstage?

20:08.665 --> 20:10.834
{\an1}It's not worth
the price, Valerie.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.294
I can't lie to Donna.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.463
You already have.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.299
{\an1}What do you want Valerie?
Spell it out.

20:17.382 --> 20:21.303
{\an3}How can I make it
clearer to you?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.013
I want you back in my bed.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.474
{\an1}And if I don't,
then you're going

20:25.557 --> 20:27.309
{\an1}to go tell, Donna, right?
Is that the deal?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.811
{\an3}No. Why would I
want to hurt Donna?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.063
She's one of my best friends.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.689
{\an1}But if we don't pick up
where we left off,

20:32.773 --> 20:34.316
{\an1}then I'm never going
to work here again, huh?

20:34.399 --> 20:36.526
You know people overestimate

20:36.610 --> 20:38.320
{\an3}the value of a
college education.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.782
{\an3}You're much smarter
than I thought.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.576
And you're far more vicious.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.844
VALERIE:
<i>Don't get me wrong, guys.</i>

21:02.928 --> 21:04.680
{\an3}I think Ray's music
is very solid

21:04.763 --> 21:06.556
{\an3}and his band has a
hardworking sound, but...

21:06.640 --> 21:08.475
don't you think it's time to get
some new blood around here?

21:08.558 --> 21:11.019
{\an3}See, I couldn't agree
with you more.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.187
David!

21:12.270 --> 21:13.313
It's not like I want to ace
the guy out of anything,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.482
but I don't know, I just think
there's a lot of great

21:15.565 --> 21:16.858
{\an3}bands out there that
deserve a shot.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.360
My sentiments exactly.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.404
Are you not going to let Ray
play at all anymore?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.239
Well, we'll see,
but in the meantime,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.156
I'd like a proposed schedule

21:23.240 --> 21:24.992
of the bookings
for the next two months.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.077
{\an3}You know, to publish
a calendar.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.078
Is that a problem?

21:28.161 --> 21:29.997
It's no problem at all.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.040
{\an3}Just give us a couple days,
we'll get everything together.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.668
{\an3}That's what I
wanted to hear.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.253
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.946
{\an1}Hi, son.
How're you doing?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.240
Don't "hi, son" me okay?

22:05.323 --> 22:07.826
{\an1}I can see you are
your usual charming self.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.620
{\an1}Scotch on the rocks,
how about you?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.831
I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.876
{\an1}I, on the other hand,
am starved.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.754
So I think I'm going to have
a New York Strip medium rare,

22:18.837 --> 22:20.756
baked potato, sour cream

22:20.839 --> 22:22.424
and some of those
sautéed mushrooms,

22:22.507 --> 22:23.925
{\an1}the whole nine yards.
What do you say?

22:24.009 --> 22:25.552
I said I'm not hungry, okay?

22:27.554 --> 22:29.181
I can see you're
not too thrilled

22:29.264 --> 22:31.516
about, uh, my selling the club.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.436
Did you sleep with Valerie?

22:34.519 --> 22:35.979
What?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.439
{\an3}Don't play
dumb with me.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.608
{\an1}(chuckles)
You got

22:39.691 --> 22:41.568
quite an imagination.

22:41.651 --> 22:42.944
Or you got a dirty mind.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.113
{\an3}How else did she get you
to sell the club, Dad?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.740
How about money?

22:46.823 --> 22:47.949
That's how people usually

22:48.033 --> 22:49.910
do business.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.995
Matter of fact,
this is for you.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.413
Oh, what's that?

22:53.497 --> 22:54.706
That's your commission.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.292
{\an1}If I say so myself,
I made a very tasty profit

22:57.375 --> 22:58.919
{\an1}for a three-month
investment.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.004
{\an1}Commission?
Mm-hmm.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.760
Oh...

23:06.843 --> 23:09.471
uh, this is all for me?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.806
All yours, sonny boy.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.474
{\an1}If it wasn't for you,
I never would have

23:12.557 --> 23:14.142
{\an1}been in that club
in the first place.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.477
Well, thanks.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.020
My pleasure.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.481
{\an3}You know, maybe I will
have that steak now.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.816
And that Vegas salad.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.567
{\an3}You know, the one where
the lettuce dances

23:22.651 --> 23:24.528
around the plate in that
lovely vinaigrette sauce.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.488
(laughs)
Waiter, get over here!

23:26.571 --> 23:29.658
(indistinct, distant shouting)

23:50.262 --> 23:54.724
♪ ♪

24:07.612 --> 24:08.864
She fired him?

24:08.947 --> 24:12.033
I wouldn't say that.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.828
I got the feeling there
were, um...

24:14.911 --> 24:16.163
creative differences.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.707
I thought Valerie liked
Ray's music.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.542
I don't know.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.461
She just called
David and I in,

24:23.545 --> 24:25.380
{\an3}and told us to start
looking for new bands.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.382
{\an1}But you guys told her
that Ray's great,

24:27.465 --> 24:28.884
{\an1}and that's she's crazy
to get rid of him, right?

24:28.967 --> 24:30.385
{\an3}Yeah, I tried; she
wouldn't listen to me.

24:30.468 --> 24:31.386
What about David?

24:31.469 --> 24:35.557
Um... he, uh...

24:36.600 --> 24:38.226
Stabbed Ray in the back, right?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.561
I wouldn't put it that way.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.645
Oh, I would.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.441
You know it's one thing to hurt
me, but to hurt someone

24:44.524 --> 24:46.735
who's struggling to make
something of himself?

24:46.818 --> 24:47.986
That is so low.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.447
{\an1}Poor Ray.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.782
He must be feeling really
terrible right now.

25:04.502 --> 25:07.297
{\an3}Guess the apple doesn't
fall very far from the tree.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.924
{\an1}What is that
supposed to mean?

25:09.007 --> 25:11.801
Running away, just
like your father.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.303
I am not running away.

25:13.386 --> 25:14.596
I'm getting run out of town.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.764
{\an1}There's a big
difference.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.600
Oh, some club closes
its door to you,

25:18.683 --> 25:19.935
and you're ready
to head for the hills?

25:20.018 --> 25:21.228
Look, I got a booking agent

25:21.311 --> 25:23.104
setting up gigs
in colleges all over

25:23.188 --> 25:24.731
the Northwest.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.400
Besides, out of sight is
out of mind, and right now

25:27.484 --> 25:28.443
{\an1}that's probably
my best bet.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.570
And what about Donna?

25:32.656 --> 25:34.991
I love Donna.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.243
But I don't want to hurt her.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.495
But you're going to sneak out
of town without telling her?

25:38.578 --> 25:41.248
I will call her
from the road.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.124
{\an3}I thought you were
supposed to work tonight.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.752
{\an5}Mom, did you hear anything
I just said?
Answer me.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.462
Are you booked
to do a show tonight?

25:47.545 --> 25:49.839
Yes.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.969
Well, then if you have
any pride in your work,

25:54.052 --> 25:57.013
{\an3}and any decency
in you heart,

25:57.097 --> 25:59.432
{\an3}you will show up
at that club tonight

25:59.516 --> 26:00.934
{\an3}and you will honor
your commitment.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.480
{\an3}And then afterwards, you'll
go out back with Donna,

26:05.563 --> 26:07.649
and you'll take her in your arms

26:07.732 --> 26:09.693
and you will give
her a kiss she'll remember

26:09.776 --> 26:11.528
for the rest of her life.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.116
{\an1}(sighs)

26:35.552 --> 26:38.305
{\an1}I'd like the, uh,
presidential suite, please.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.807
Stones, man!

26:40.890 --> 26:42.809
{\an3}Hey, where the hell
have you been?

26:42.892 --> 26:44.519
You don't call,

26:44.602 --> 26:46.062
{\an3}you don't write,
you never fax me...

26:46.146 --> 26:48.565
Hey, I'm here, man.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.025
Come on.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.693
{\an1}I'll get you a cup
of bad coffee.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.363
Speaking of bad coffee,
it kind of goes with the decor.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.240
{\an5}How'd you get stuck
in this dump?
Hey, my family

26:57.324 --> 26:59.159
{\an1}owns this dump.
Oh.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.411
Being here keeps me
out of trouble.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.872
Gives me a lot of time to write.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.541
Speaking of trouble, um...

27:06.624 --> 27:07.709
I almost got in some today.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.461
Oh...

27:09.544 --> 27:11.254
{\an1}Well, that explains
why I'm seeing your mug

27:11.338 --> 27:12.422
for the very first time

27:12.505 --> 27:13.673
since we got out of rehab.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.050
How about you?

27:15.133 --> 27:16.676
Are you staying clean?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.220
I have no choice.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.640
{\an3}If it hadn't been
for a big wind today

27:22.724 --> 27:25.560
I probably would've, uh,
got one lit up, you know?

27:25.643 --> 27:28.021
{\an1}You can't fool
Mother Nature, huh?

27:28.104 --> 27:29.064
So what got to you?

27:29.147 --> 27:30.523
Take a guess.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.485
Ah... a woman.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.236
Yeah.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.863
Kelly? Valerie?

27:36.946 --> 27:39.032
They ganged up on me.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.409
Val supplied the
smoke, but Kelly,

27:41.493 --> 27:42.786
she supplied the motivation.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.329
Let her go, man.

27:44.412 --> 27:47.290
You got to let her go.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.793
I am trying, but...
No, no, no-- no, buts.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.920
{\an1}"But" is just an excuse
to get high, man.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.255
I figured it out,

27:54.339 --> 27:55.757
all by myself.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.092
Good!

27:57.175 --> 27:59.260
Good.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.262
So what the hell are
you bothering me for?

28:01.346 --> 28:04.140
Oh, I just came for the
incredibly bad coffee.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.435
Stones, man...

28:07.519 --> 28:09.479
you ever give some thought
to the concept that maybe

28:09.562 --> 28:10.939
{\an1}you ought to figure out
what to do with your life?

28:11.022 --> 28:13.566
Yeah, I considered it.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.652
And?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.738
I don't know.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.117
{\an1}Well, you better
come up with something.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.868
{\an1}Because one of these days
the wind is not

28:23.952 --> 28:26.246
going to be blowing when you go
to fire up that joint.

28:32.877 --> 28:36.131
Tell me something, if your
mother's condo got robbed,

28:36.214 --> 28:38.258
{\an1}would she call the mayor
of Beverly Hills?

28:38.341 --> 28:39.759
Well, technically,

28:39.843 --> 28:41.428
{\an3}she's on the Los
Angeles border, so...

28:41.511 --> 28:42.929
{\an1}Oh, no, no, no--
that's not what I mean.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.305
What I mean is,
why is everybody

28:44.389 --> 28:45.765
coming to me with this?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.518
What do I have to do
with campus security?

28:48.601 --> 28:50.145
They have to have
somebody to blame.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.521
{\an1}Tell me about it.
You should've heard them

28:51.604 --> 28:52.647
at the senate meeting.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.442
Like I have anything to do
with the university budget.

28:55.525 --> 28:58.319
{\an1}Like I have anything
to do with hiring campus cops.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.113
{\an3}Well, they probably
think that you

29:00.196 --> 29:02.615
{\an6}will talk to
the chancellor.
I did.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.868
{\an1}Kelly, people get
ripped off all the time:

29:04.951 --> 29:07.203
car stereos, bikes.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.997
{\an1}What am I supposed
to do about it?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.623
{\an1}I'm the Student Body
president,

29:10.707 --> 29:12.667
I am not Batman.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.627
Yeah, but I bet you
look cute in tights.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.171
Well, thank you for that.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.506
{\an3}You know, you are getting
far too wound up over this.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.343
I know. It's at times like
this when I hate this job.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.636
I'll tell you what.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.638
{\an3}I will go home and draw
you a nice warm bath

29:25.722 --> 29:27.015
and give you a back rub,

29:27.098 --> 29:28.183
and everything
will be okay.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.559
{\an1}Well, that sounds
very agreeable.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.394
(rustling)

29:31.478 --> 29:33.480
Did you hear that?

29:33.563 --> 29:35.064
What?

29:35.148 --> 29:37.317
{\an3}I don't know, I swear
I heard something.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.860
{\an1}That was my stomach.
I'm hungry.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.196
{\an1}Let's go get something
to eat.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.532
{\an3}All of a sudden, I'm getting
the creepiest feeling.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.783
Well, all right. Okay.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.577
Come on. Let's get out.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.745
I'm scared.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.371
Isn't everybody?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.415
{\an1}The thing is that,
we were right there,

29:52.499 --> 29:53.541
we were steps away...

30:05.845 --> 30:09.140
{\an3}So on a scale of one to
ten, how mad at me is she?

30:09.224 --> 30:10.934
{\an1}Somewhere between
ten and 11.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.560
{\an3}See, Clare, why couldn't
you just tell her

30:12.644 --> 30:14.270
{\an3}that I supported
Ray, too?

30:14.354 --> 30:15.522
{\an1}I did. She wouldn't
believe me, okay?

30:15.605 --> 30:18.566
Hey, I thought I heard
you guys out here.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.026
Here, man.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.486
I was out of line yesterday,

30:21.569 --> 30:23.404
so I made you a copy
of my Hendrix bootleg.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.406
{\an3}Oh, thanks.
Anytime.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.408
Excuse me.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.035
Hey, where are
you going, Amy?

30:29.118 --> 30:30.453
Home to my parents.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.579
This school isn't safe anymore.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.623
{\an3}What's the matter, they
steal another two-wheeler?

30:33.706 --> 30:34.958
This isn't about
bicycles, Lenny.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.210
Melody Reynolds
was raped this afternoon.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.754
What?

30:39.837 --> 30:40.964
In the bushes
behind the South Quad.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.799
In broad daylight?

30:43.841 --> 30:44.592
That's awful.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.428
{\an1}Is she gonna be okay?
I don't know.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.764
I saw the ambulance on my way
back from chem lab.

30:49.847 --> 30:51.099
I heard she was slashed up

30:51.182 --> 30:54.310
{\an1}pretty good.
Any idea who did it?

30:54.394 --> 30:55.812
No, but the police
are all over campus.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.146
I got to go.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.440
Well, let's look
on the bright side.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.276
At least they won't
be stealing any bicycles

31:01.359 --> 31:02.902
in the next few days.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.073
{\an1}You know, Lenny,
you're a real charmer.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.801
{\an4}What do you say,
get a cup of coffee?
No can do.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.469
I've got another meeting
in a few minutes.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.306
{\an1}How many bureaucrats does it
take to catch a rapist?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.682
Don't ask me man.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.100
{\an3}If I ever thought
I had an idea

31:34.183 --> 31:35.977
{\an3}about how this
university's run,

31:36.060 --> 31:37.979
{\an3}it's been shattered
in the last two hours.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.439
What's that mean?

31:39.522 --> 31:41.649
{\an3}You know these people,
they make all these noises

31:41.733 --> 31:43.651
{\an3}about student
involvement all year,

31:43.735 --> 31:45.778
{\an3}and then as soon as
there's a crisis they say,

31:45.862 --> 31:47.614
{\an3}"Brandon the administration
will handle this."

31:47.697 --> 31:48.990
{\an1}Well, what about
that girl that was raped?

31:49.073 --> 31:50.158
{\an1}Wasn't she
in the student senate?

31:50.241 --> 31:51.284
Not exactly.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.327
{\an3}She was on a lot
of committees.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.870
{\an3}I know her.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.163
{\an1}Is there any truth
to that rumor

31:55.246 --> 31:56.873
that they have a suspect?
I don't know.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.374
{\an3}They aren't telling
me anything.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.293
Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you.
Hey, Kel.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.961
{\an3}Hey, are you okay?
No, I'm scared.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.004
Isn't everybody?

32:03.087 --> 32:05.340
{\an3}The thing is, we were
right there, steps away

32:05.423 --> 32:06.841
from where it happened.
It could have been me.

32:06.924 --> 32:09.344
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
take it easy.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.012
Do me a favor.
Don't walk around

32:11.095 --> 32:12.388
alone anymore until this
whole thing's settled.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.308
When's that going to be?

32:15.391 --> 32:17.185
I wish I knew.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.104
(tuning)

32:33.951 --> 32:36.037
I heard you were here.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.497
So?

32:37.580 --> 32:38.706
Didn't expect you.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.875
Well, I have a contract
with this nightclub.

32:40.958 --> 32:42.543
Tonight's my last date.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.463
I believe in fulfilling
my obligations.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.590
How professional of you.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.384
Of course, if you want to pay me
not to play,

32:49.467 --> 32:50.718
I'd be more than happy to leave.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.847
I don't believe in paying
someone for nothing.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.391
Is Donna here yet?

32:56.474 --> 32:58.226
Why?

32:58.309 --> 33:00.019
Just wanted to say hello.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.230
Look, you stay away from her,
Valerie, you understand that?

33:02.313 --> 33:04.941
Is that a threat, Ray?

33:05.024 --> 33:05.983
'Cause for the life of me,

33:06.067 --> 33:08.236
I can't see what you have
to threaten me with.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.071
That's where you're wrong.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.197
I've got one thing.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.365
And what's that?

33:12.448 --> 33:13.741
The truth.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.452
Oh, please.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.080
You wouldn't dare tell sweet
Donna the truth about us.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.581
{\an1}Break
the illusion that

33:20.665 --> 33:23.084
her country boy isn't
just another snake in the grass.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.753
You're the snake
in the grass, Valerie.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.603
What's this?

33:42.687 --> 33:44.772
It's your present.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.608
Well, more for me.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.943
Yeah.

33:49.026 --> 33:51.571
So do you have
any plans tonight?

33:51.654 --> 33:53.448
Yeah, I do,
they just don't happen

33:53.531 --> 33:54.907
to include you.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.592
('50s style rock playing)

34:12.675 --> 34:13.717
You could pick something

34:13.801 --> 34:15.803
{\an1}a little more upbeat,
couldn't you?

34:15.887 --> 34:17.929
{\an3}Well, if I'd known you were
going to be here, I would've.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.931
Pick one.
(buttons clicking)

34:20.016 --> 34:21.809
{\an1}So are you
going to stick around

34:21.893 --> 34:23.478
for Ray's farewell concert?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.521
I don't think so.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.649
{\an1}You know, I never got
a chance to tell you how much

34:28.733 --> 34:31.235
it meant to me that you came to
see me on campus the other day.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.987
It's no big deal.

34:34.071 --> 34:35.782
Well, it was to me.

be evolving with Finley

34:51.088 --> 34:53.507

for the fraud that he is.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.456
Jesse's mom, why?

35:25.540 --> 35:27.375
{\an1}Think she can stay
a little late?

35:28.918 --> 35:30.211
What is that?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.504
Keys to a motel room.

35:31.587 --> 35:32.713
<i>Our</i> motel room.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.006
I booked it by the week.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.258
Peter, I don't know.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.593
{\an3}That sounds just a
little bit sleazy to me.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.887
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

35:42.515 --> 35:44.433
Tonight?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.560
No, not tonight.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.728
Jesse's mom would
never understand.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.230
Then tomorrow night.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.731
{\an1}And the day after that.
Maybe.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.191
{\an1}And the day after...
Maybe!

35:59.991 --> 36:02.076
{\an1}You know, I'm not sure
it was such a smart move

36:02.159 --> 36:03.202
{\an1}not going
to the club tonight?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.872
I told Valerie we were checking
out an act across town.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.373
Oh, great, I told her
we were studying.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.125
You know, maybe
we shouldn't be booking bands

36:09.208 --> 36:10.376
at all for her.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.627
Look, don't worry about it,
all right?

36:11.711 --> 36:12.753
Donna will be over everything

36:12.837 --> 36:14.088
as soon as Ray
books another gig.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.133
{\an5}You'll see.
I don't know,
I hope so.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.176
Oh, there's Lenny.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.428
{\an3}Do you have to invite
him over here.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.971
Yes. Lenny.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.222
{\an1}Over here.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.390
No, that's okay.

36:24.473 --> 36:25.433
You two don't need company.

36:25.516 --> 36:26.726
Have a nice evening.

36:30.187 --> 36:31.731
No, come on over.

36:31.814 --> 36:32.857
Sit down.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.402
Hey, how you
doing, Lenny?

36:36.485 --> 36:37.737
I'm getting by.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.071
Thanks.
How's it going?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.072
{\an3}Good.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.074
So you know a lot
of people on campus, huh?

36:42.158 --> 36:44.327
Well, what can I say?
I'm Mr. Popularity.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.497
What did you think
of my Hendrix tape?

36:48.581 --> 36:49.790
Oh, it was cool.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.126
{\an1}That, uh, that
one track, the, uh,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.253
the "Manic Depression"

36:54.337 --> 36:56.130
{\an1}where he's on the...
Excuse me.

36:56.213 --> 36:57.465
Leonard Ziminski?

36:57.548 --> 36:58.758
{\an3}Yes?

36:58.841 --> 37:01.260
Detective Hank Garcia, LAPD.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.803
{\an3}Would you come
with us, please?

37:04.013 --> 37:06.140
What, am I under arrest
or something?

37:06.223 --> 37:07.808
{\an1}No, sir, we just have
a few questions.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.936
{\an1}About what?
We don't want to make

37:10.019 --> 37:11.395
this any more difficult
than it has to be.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.151
I didn't steal
any of those bicycles.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.153
This isn't about
bicycles, Mr. Ziminski.

37:19.236 --> 37:20.947
Then what is this about?

37:21.030 --> 37:22.448
David, it's okay.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.082
Let's go.

37:34.585 --> 37:35.503
I don't get this.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.837
What's going on here?

37:36.921 --> 37:38.881
They don't think
he's the rapist, do they?

37:51.394 --> 37:53.354
You were great tonight.
Thanks.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.065
{\an3}So how about breakfast?
I'm starved.

37:56.148 --> 37:58.859
{\an1}I'm not really
in the mood to eat.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.861
{\an3}Look, don't let it
get to you.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.072
{\an3}You're gonna find another
gig a whole lot sooner

38:03.155 --> 38:05.992
{\an3}than she'll find another
band as good as yours.

38:06.075 --> 38:08.995
{\an1}I already found
another gig, Donna.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.496
{\an3}Really?

38:10.579 --> 38:12.373
That's great! Where?

38:12.456 --> 38:15.001
I got to leave town
for a little while.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.377
What?

38:16.460 --> 38:17.878
I've got this agent

38:17.962 --> 38:19.755
{\an1}who's booked a bunch
of clubs for me up north.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.049
Mostly college towns.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.386
So why didn't you tell me?

38:25.469 --> 38:28.556
Well, I wasn't sure until today.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.224
And I didn't want to upset you.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.227
When are you leaving?

38:33.310 --> 38:35.104
Tonight.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.941
Oh.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.861
Look, will you tell me
that you're gonna miss me?

38:41.944 --> 38:43.154
'Cause I'm really
gonna miss you.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.658
You know I will.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.244
So when are you coming back?

38:50.327 --> 38:52.204
I don't know.

38:55.207 --> 38:56.751
What's the matter?

38:56.834 --> 39:00.171
This... just isn't like you.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.133
There's something
I've got to tell you, Donna.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.885
Something important.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.136
What?

39:11.015 --> 39:12.683
I love you.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.936
I know that.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.939
{\an3}And there's something else.
No.

39:19.023 --> 39:23.110
Nothing else matters.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.113
You love me,
and that's all I need to know.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.323
Do you mean that?

39:29.366 --> 39:31.327
With all my heart.
