<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.133 --> 00:11.720
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:14.389
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:18.060
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.563
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>

00:21.813 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.608
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:29.988
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:36.703
Hey, great idea bringing
the couch out here

00:36.787 --> 00:38.413
- from your den, Peter.
- Yeah, Lois and I

00:38.497 --> 00:40.666
dragged it out here last night
for a little hump sesh,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.209
so I figured I'd let it dry.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.962
"Couch." That's one of those words

00:45.045 --> 00:46.171
that if you say it over and over

00:46.255 --> 00:47.756
it starts to sound silly.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.967
Joe, you need
to take a class on small talk.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.177
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm in one.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.596
It sure is cloudy today.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.516
Good. You could have
also responded to Janet,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.059
who said her son died.

00:59.268 --> 01:02.521
I'm sorry your son died
on such a cloudy day.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.070
All right, kids, here's your bacon.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.322
- I call the paper towel!
- Aw, damn it!

01:12.489 --> 01:15.993
Ha-ha! You got to move fast
when Meg's at the table, Brian.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.203
All right, well, I get the box
when we have pizza for dinner.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.247
Uh-uh.
It doesn't work that way.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.207
You got to call it when it's happening.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.334
Good morning, family.
I'll be out front

01:24.418 --> 01:25.836
with the guys if anybody needs me.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.171
Peter, I thought we were gonna try

01:27.254 --> 01:29.047
to get the garden going again today.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.718
I know, sweetie, but then
I realized how stupid that is.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.304
Okay, bye. You guys are my everything.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.014
Why'd you ever marry him?

01:37.139 --> 01:40.392
Believe it or not, he used
to look like a young Gene Hackman.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.395
That's... that's not even good.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.605
It's gone!

01:44.771 --> 01:45.981
What? What's gone?

01:46.190 --> 01:48.525
Our drinking couch!
Somebody must've stole it!

01:48.734 --> 01:50.485
You left a couch out on the curb?

01:50.569 --> 01:52.571
Well, somebody probably thought
it was trash and took it.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.282
You said you were gonna bring
the couch right back in!

01:55.365 --> 01:57.951
- What were you thinking?
- I'll tell you what I was thinking.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.078
I was thinking we lived
in a safe neighborhood.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.413
But apparently, I was wrong!

02:01.580 --> 02:04.499
Wait, you're saying
you were wr... wr...

02:04.583 --> 02:07.127
wro... wrrr...

02:07.211 --> 02:09.838
Oh, I get it...
the Fonz can't say "wrong."

02:09.922 --> 02:12.633
No, Peter, he's 70...
he's having a stroke.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.848
Wow, Peter, I think
starting a community watch

02:19.932 --> 02:22.976
- is a great idea.
- Yeah, I even got shirts made up for us.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.603
This is quality work.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.772
Where did you get these?
Via the Web?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.232
Hey, listen, Joe,

02:28.315 --> 02:29.858
you think you can get us all guns?

02:30.108 --> 02:31.693
No, Peter, they're too dangerous.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.779
Besides, you can't just go get a gun,

02:33.862 --> 02:36.031
you have to be certified in gun safety,

02:36.114 --> 02:38.367
go through an extensive
background screening process.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.868
- Got 'em.
- Whoa.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.036
How'd you get 'em so quick?

02:41.119 --> 02:43.330
It was easy...
like pressing that "easy" button

02:43.413 --> 02:44.998
at the office supply store.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.959
- Hey, thanks for all your help.
- No problem.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.836
Why don't you go ahead
and hit the "easy" button.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.920
Okay.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.632
What did I just do?
Don't worry about it.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.430
Hey, Quagmire, you're a sex guy.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.559
You watch any good pornos lately?

03:03.642 --> 03:06.103
I mean... I guess.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.521
So what's your pleasure?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.022
What kind of movies you like?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.650
I don't know.
MILF stuff's kind of cool.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.151
What... what about you?

03:13.235 --> 03:15.988
Me? I have very particular tastes.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.198
- I like a soapy bottom.
- What?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.867
Soft-core soaped-up butts,

03:19.950 --> 03:21.994
like from a PG-13 camp movie.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.580
I can't get enough of it.
Drives me wild.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.206
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.541
All right...

03:29.168 --> 03:31.587
it's kind of too cool
for the air-conditioner

03:31.670 --> 03:33.380
and too warm for the heater, huh?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.384
Ah, got to walk that boner off, huh?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.844
Yeah.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.057
Hey, guys, you better come with me.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.643
There's some weird, big-nose guy
hiding in the bushes

03:46.727 --> 03:48.187
outside some chick's house.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.524
"My heart always timidly hides itself

03:52.608 --> 03:53.734
"behind my mind."

03:55.152 --> 03:57.487
"I set out to bring down stars

03:57.571 --> 03:58.822
"from the sky..."

03:59.615 --> 04:01.325
-"Ow. Ow.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.161
"Oh, my God,
four men are beating me.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.330
"My arm. I think it is broken.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.831
"Who are you guys?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.416
"Why? Why?

04:09.499 --> 04:12.836
"I'll give you anything
if you would only stop hitting me.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.838
"Please stop pulling my nose.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.298
"It is not fake.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.091
"I think I am dying.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.552
"Please take me to the hospital."

04:20.802 --> 04:22.679
Your words have bewitched me.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.556
I need your arms around me.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.308
Come to
my chamber at once.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.060
"Come to my chamber at once."

04:28.143 --> 04:31.313
- And bring pound cake.
-"And bring pound cake."

04:35.400 --> 04:36.652
Peter, please come to bed.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.320
Enough of the community watch.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.489
We live on a very safe street.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.075
Lois, you wouldn't believe
the things we see out there.

04:43.158 --> 04:46.078
There was a kid riding his bike
while holding a tennis racket.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.956
- For real.
- Come on! Let's fool around,

04:49.039 --> 04:50.374
or watch a movie,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.960
or finally click that
"Crackle" icon on the TV.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.546
Lois, I am an unelected vigilante,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.464
and I take my job very seriously.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.466
Like Serious George.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.343
Hey, George, want to go to the park?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.679
Thank you, but no.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.306
It's a beautiful day...
lots of mischief to get into.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.641
I don't doubt that,

05:07.724 --> 05:09.184
but as you can see,
I'm pretty busy.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.520
I'm trying to get
a head start on my taxes.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.147
Oh, I see... trying
to figure out a way

05:14.231 --> 05:15.774
to deduct <i>bananas?</i>

05:15.858 --> 05:18.902
'Cause I eat bananas. Terrific.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.196
Hey, your inside,
so don't wear a hat.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.491
Unless you're leaving,
which would be terrific also.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.793
What the hell? Hey, you!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.213
Step away from that table.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.717
Brain fart.
Window. Sorry.

05:42.593 --> 05:43.760
Hold it right there!

05:44.261 --> 05:46.263
I'm warning you!
Hands where I could see 'em.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.941
Cleveland Jr.?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.402
Mr. Griffin! You shot me!

06:00.611 --> 06:02.112
Oh, my God!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.406
Peter, where are you?

06:04.489 --> 06:08.744
Peter? Okay, I'm starting
<i>The Good Wife</i> without you.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.162
Phew! Heh.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.414
Unlike you, I just dodged a bullet.

06:19.421 --> 06:23.425
Okay, next is the... brown family.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.719
Oh. Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.930
Sometimes I write descriptions
of my patients

06:28.013 --> 06:29.223
to help me remember them.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.808
No, it's okay. Our last name is Brown.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.185
Oh, okay. Phew.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.979
Ah, then this must be
"Chubster Dumb-Dumb."

06:37.481 --> 06:39.191
I'm sorry, sir. No visitors.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.277
Excuse me, I'll have you know
I'm the shooter!

06:42.361 --> 06:43.779
So, how's he doing?

06:43.862 --> 06:46.031
"How's he doing"?
How do you think he's doing!

06:46.114 --> 06:47.491
You shot my son!

06:47.699 --> 06:49.243
Look, Cleveland, I'm real sorry.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.412
I thought someone was breaking
into your house, and I panicked.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.914
It was dark. I...

06:53.997 --> 06:55.457
I don't know
why he didn't just say it was him.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.252
I couldn't hear you.
I was listening to music,

06:58.335 --> 07:00.921
I went to turn it down,
and the next thing I know,

07:01.004 --> 07:02.005
you shot me!

07:02.089 --> 07:03.298
Why the hell
were you climbing in the window

07:03.382 --> 07:04.675
of your own house anyway?

07:04.842 --> 07:06.552
My dad says opening the door

07:06.635 --> 07:08.428
lets out too much air-conditioning.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.597
I already have a bullet in my son,

07:10.681 --> 07:12.349
I don't need one in my wallet.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.893
You wouldn't have fired
that gun if he was white!

07:14.977 --> 07:16.645
That's not true... I'll shoot anybody.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.855
Joe, give me your gun.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.398
Here you go... Hey, wait a second!

07:19.606 --> 07:21.358
Look, let's all just calm down.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.568
Calm down?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.611
I want this racist out the room,

07:24.695 --> 07:25.863
and I want him arrested!

07:25.988 --> 07:28.490
Racist? I put these gloves on
for everybody.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.867
Oh, oh, you're talking to him.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.161
Look, the police department
has deemed the shooting accidental.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.622
Given the circumstances,
Peter was within his rights

07:35.706 --> 07:36.748
to fire his weapon.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.918
And what about my son's rights
not to beshot?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.420
Look, Cleveland...

07:41.503 --> 07:43.547
Lat... Latisha?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.007
I thought he had a gun.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.801
I'd never want to do anything
to hurt you or your family.

07:47.885 --> 07:48.886
You're my friend.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.262
I was your friend.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.555
Now, get out of here!

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
You're nothing but a worthless bigot!

07:56.852 --> 07:58.729
Wow, I really messed up.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.940
I haven't felt this bad
since I drove by that speed sign.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.408
Aw...

08:22.294 --> 08:24.421
Hey, does anybody know
if Cleveland's coming by?

08:24.505 --> 08:26.840
I was hoping to apologize
and collect his deposit

08:26.924 --> 08:29.384
- for the community watch shirts.
- I talked to him earlier.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.929
He... he doesn't want
to be anywhere near you.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.014
Hey, look, they're talking
about the shooting.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.516
Good evening. Two nights ago

08:35.599 --> 08:38.185
there was a shooting right here
in our own backyard.

08:38.268 --> 08:42.064
a 14-year-old boy
named Cleveland Brown Jr.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.525
Joining me tonight
is his father, Cleveland Brown.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.110
So that's not really Quahog?
It's just a big picture?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.780
Now, Mr. Brown, I understand
you're trying to get the police

08:49.863 --> 08:51.281
to reopen the investigation.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.867
That's right, Tom.
My family and I believe

08:53.951 --> 08:57.120
this shooting was a hate crime,
and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin

08:57.287 --> 08:59.081
held accountable for his actions.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.250
Hate crime? That's crazy!

09:01.333 --> 09:02.459
I love all people!

09:02.543 --> 09:04.127
I love blacks, I love Asians...

09:04.211 --> 09:06.463
hell, I even love gay Aborigines.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.228
Wow, this is just great, Peter.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.146
Everyone in town hates us now.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.858
The cashier at the grocery store
told her to "push on,"

09:25.941 --> 09:27.484
and then she snapped her fingers,

09:27.568 --> 09:30.571
and now I think she's my new
favorite lady in the world.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.282
I don't understand. I'm not a racist.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.701
It's well documented
that my dream three-way

09:35.784 --> 09:38.537
is S. Epatha Merkerson
and CCH Pounder.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.289
S., this is CCH.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.832
CCH, this is S.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.667
It is my intention that we conduct this

09:43.750 --> 09:45.836
with both sexiness and dignity.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.838
Peter, this is a hot-button issue.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.507
I mean, you shot
an African-American kid.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.176
Of course this isn't just gonna go away.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.761
Well, there's got to be something I can do
to make things right.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.472
I'll just have to prove to everybody
that I'm not a racist.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.725
- How are you gonna do that?
- Well, for starters,

09:59.808 --> 10:01.518
I'm gonna head over to the YMCA.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.395
There's nothing black guys like more

10:03.478 --> 10:06.440
than out-of-shape
indoor-basketball white guys.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.069
Hey! I'm trying my best here.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.530
And trying is what matters most of all.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.990
You're right, Peter.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.533
We need to give you a chance,

10:16.617 --> 10:18.285
no matter what color your skin is.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.037
Come on, let's play some ball.

10:21.705 --> 10:25.125
"...and then Peter and his new friends
went for ice cream."

10:25.209 --> 10:26.460
The end.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.547
Okay, kids, are your parents
out of the room?

10:30.631 --> 10:34.468
Good. Let's get back
to <i>Sloppy Floppers</i> magazine.

10:39.723 --> 10:40.891
What are you doing?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.060
Lois, to show I'm in touch
with what it's like

10:43.143 --> 10:45.354
to be African-American,
I am gonna go to the middle

10:45.437 --> 10:48.440
of the town square, get naked
and paint myself brown.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.400
No, no, that's offensive.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.818
You can't pretend to be black.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.237
That's a stupid idea.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.280
- What?
-It's a stupid idea!

10:55.364 --> 10:58.825
You're a stupid man!
A stupid, stupid man!

10:58.909 --> 11:01.912
Ow, you're hurting me!
Stop it, stop it, Lois!

11:01.995 --> 11:04.414
No! I'm so sick of your crap.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.792
Why do you always
do these stupid things?

11:06.875 --> 11:10.212
And why do you always announce
them to me before you do them?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.714
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

11:12.798 --> 11:16.176
Are you happy now?
Is this what you want?

11:16.260 --> 11:18.220
Oh, no, it's not what I want!

11:18.303 --> 11:21.223
It's not what I want.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.686
It's never been this bad before.
What do we do?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.312
What we always do.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.899
I'm in charge of my head...
that much I know!

11:36.822 --> 11:39.157
What the hell
are you doing on my property?

11:39.241 --> 11:40.951
Look, it's time we bury the hatchet.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.828
So I brought a bottle
of your favorite booze.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.080
Now let's just have a drink
and put this all behind us.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.748
I don't want nothing from you.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.208
Well, hold on, I got something else.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.961
Cigars. We can smoke 'em together,
all happy,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.963
like a bunch of douche bags
outside a wedding.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.214
Peter, get out of here.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.508
I'm never gonna forgive you
for what you did.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.677
Aw, come on.
This'll change your mind.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.891
Oh, my God!
Quick, do something!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.562
It's not working. Get rid of it!

12:15.694 --> 12:17.446
Get your family out of that house!

12:17.529 --> 12:19.239
If they don't leave, they'll die.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.116
Round up your family and get out

12:21.200 --> 12:22.326
or you're all gonna be sorry.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.702
Get out, now!

12:25.037 --> 12:27.164
See, kids, I told you
we'd make friends here.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.292
I guess me getting transferred
by the Xerox Corporation

12:30.375 --> 12:32.252
wasn't the worst thing
after all.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.638
Oh, thank God, Joe.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.723
Are you here to give me
the deposit for the shirts?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.808
No, Peter, I'm here to place you
under arrest

12:46.892 --> 12:48.936
for the attempted murder
of Cleveland Jr.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.480
What are you talkin' about?
You know it was an accident.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.233
Yeah, but let's just say,
public opinion has shifted.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.860
And the boys upstairs said
they can no longer ignore it.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.695
Who the hell are the "boys upstairs?"

12:58.820 --> 13:00.614
I have no idea. There's no elevator.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.782
But whoever they are,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.575
they're pretty steamed
about this whole thing.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.453
Peter, what's going on?

13:06.537 --> 13:07.871
They're taking me to jail!

13:07.955 --> 13:09.081
Oh, my God!

13:09.164 --> 13:10.290
Don't worry, Dad!

13:10.374 --> 13:12.918
I'll send you a cake with a file in it!

13:14.419 --> 13:17.422
These are just the owner manuals
for all our kitchen appliances.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.091
Well, guess I finally have time

13:19.174 --> 13:21.635
to learn to reset the clock
on the coffee maker.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.972
<i>He never did.</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:33.897
You're...

13:33.981 --> 13:35.816
you're not gonna rape me, are you?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.693
Of course I'm not gonna rape you.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.862
I'm gonna make you
fall in love with me.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.364
Then... we'll see what happens.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.576
Oh, no. It's already working.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.703
Griffin, you have a visitor.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.331
- Carter? What are you doing here?
- Hello, Griffin.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.250
I'd like to talk to you
about these charges

13:53.333 --> 13:54.751
that have been
brought against you.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.670
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

13:57.379 --> 13:59.965
I... guess I'll see you in a little bit?

14:00.048 --> 14:02.134
It's gonna feel like an eternity.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.470
How is it that I'm only
just now meeting you?

14:07.848 --> 14:09.474
Look, Carter, you got to believe me.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.935
I didn't shoot Cleveland Jr.
because he was black!

14:12.144 --> 14:14.021
Hey, you don't have
to tell me that.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.690
But the media's out there
making you look like a monster,

14:16.773 --> 14:19.443
all for exercising
your constitutional rights.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.777
Grover's a monster.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.071
But don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of this.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.740
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back

14:24.823 --> 14:26.533
and let them do this
to one of my own.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.619
- What, you mean your family?
- Huh?

14:28.744 --> 14:30.245
Oh, yeah, yeah, that. Yeah, right.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.080
Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here,

14:32.164 --> 14:34.583
set you up with my lawyer,
and get these charges dropped.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.834
Well, how you gonna do that?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.753
Don't worry.
I'll come up with a good story,

14:37.836 --> 14:39.129
and they'll eat it up.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.507
Not like when I read
my JAG fan fiction

14:41.590 --> 14:43.634
at the NCIS convention.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.344
"JAG stood up and yelled,

14:45.427 --> 14:47.971
"'Objection, Your Honor, by Navy law.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.723
"He then turned to the lady lawyer,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.600
"the gal from the October <i>Maxim,</i>

14:51.683 --> 14:53.018
"who still managed to be hot

14:53.101 --> 14:55.896
"despite her sexless, pageboy haircut.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.356
"Or perhaps because of it."

14:57.439 --> 14:58.732
- Boo!
- Terrible!

14:58.857 --> 15:01.860
Right branch of the military,
wrong investigative arm!

15:07.616 --> 15:09.993
And I was trying to
get back into my house,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.871
and my neighbor, Mr. Griffin, shot me.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.082
He said he felt threatened by me,

15:15.165 --> 15:17.501
and that hurt even worse
than getting shot!

15:17.668 --> 15:19.086
Aw!

15:19.294 --> 15:21.755
Your Honor, permission
to hug the witness?

15:21.839 --> 15:22.840
Granted.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.760
Don't worry, Mr. Griffin.

15:26.844 --> 15:27.928
You're every bit as sympathetic

15:28.011 --> 15:29.972
as this chubby-cheeked cocoa angel.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.015
I haven't been listening.
What's goin' on?

15:32.266 --> 15:33.809
I don't think it's lost on any of us

15:33.892 --> 15:36.103
that the laws are written on white paper.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.564
Yeah, white paper.
Check your jacket pocket.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.399
"I don't think it's lost on any of us

15:40.482 --> 15:42.234
"that the laws
are written on white paper."

15:42.317 --> 15:43.819
Hey, look, I'm just saying,

15:43.902 --> 15:46.530
it's no surprise
that justice isn't colorblind.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.031
Check your other jacket pocket.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.658
"Hey, look, I'm just saying

15:49.741 --> 15:51.702
"it's no surprise
that justice isn't colorblind."

15:51.785 --> 15:52.828
Stewie, you're a jerk!

15:52.911 --> 15:54.037
Check Chris' pocket.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.873
What? There's nothing in here, and...

15:55.956 --> 15:58.250
Oh, God, the bottom of the pocket's
been cut out!

15:58.417 --> 15:59.668
Thanks, Brian!

15:59.751 --> 16:02.838
I was the mastermind
behind this whole thing!

16:03.046 --> 16:04.173
Your witness.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.383
All right, watch this.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.344
This is where we take control
of the situation.

16:09.553 --> 16:12.347
Mr. Brown, you testified
that you were listening to music

16:12.431 --> 16:14.266
- at the time of the shooting.
- That's right.

16:14.433 --> 16:17.269
- And isn't Jay-Z music?
- Yes.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.023
And doesn't he have the lyrics,
"I put the gun to you.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.150
"I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up,

16:23.233 --> 16:25.652
"put ya inside the mattress
like drug money"?

16:27.154 --> 16:30.490
I was listening
to Neil Sedaka's Hanukkah album.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.284
And isn't true
that your last name

16:32.367 --> 16:34.328
is the same as Chris Brown's?

16:34.411 --> 16:35.913
Yes, but I don't see what...

16:35.996 --> 16:37.915
And what did Chris Brown do to Rihanna?

16:38.081 --> 16:40.501
He hit her, like, a hundred times.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.586
Your Honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence

16:42.669 --> 16:44.922
this photo of a badly beaten Rihanna

16:45.005 --> 16:47.633
as well as this print ad
for the <i>Entourage</i> movie.

16:47.716 --> 16:48.717
Why?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.052
I can't unsee this!

16:50.135 --> 16:51.178
Who is this for?

16:51.303 --> 16:52.471
What's he doing?

16:52.554 --> 16:54.389
He's making Cleveland Jr.
look like a thug.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.225
I know. That's the idea.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.976
You don't want to go
back to jail, do you?

17:03.690 --> 17:04.733
I don't know.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.401
Maybe.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.238
Mr. Brown, please pick up this knife.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.822
Aah! He's got a knife!

17:21.625 --> 17:22.835
This isn't fair!

17:22.918 --> 17:25.462
They're making my son
look like a common hoodlum!

17:25.546 --> 17:27.756
Joe, you're a cop! Do something!

17:27.965 --> 17:29.967
No, the soap covers everything.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.178
You might see, like,
the very top of the crack,

17:33.262 --> 17:35.556
but that's... that's not what it's about.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.312
How do you sleep at night?

17:42.563 --> 17:44.982
Propped up on pillows,
on account of my fat throat.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.900
If I lay flat on my back, I die.

17:46.984 --> 17:49.653
I need pillows
between my thighs myself.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.780
And this friendship is over!

18:02.583 --> 18:04.084
Thanks for letting me sit in the back.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.752
I was flipping people off the whole way.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.007
Get out of here, all of you!

18:10.090 --> 18:12.926
My son didn't do anything wrong!

18:16.805 --> 18:19.933
Carter, I think this has
all kind of gone too far.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.018
What do you think you're doing?

18:21.101 --> 18:23.103
I'm gonna make this right.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.981
Everyone! Everyone!

18:26.231 --> 18:28.233
Listen, I have something to say.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.736
Cleveland Jr. doesn't deserve any of this.

18:30.819 --> 18:34.031
All those things you heard
about Cleveland Jr. were lies.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.449
He didn't do anything to me.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.076
He's a good kid, from a good family.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.121
I just got scared,
and I did something stupid.

18:41.205 --> 18:43.707
I swear, it had nothing to do
with the color of his skin,

18:43.790 --> 18:46.418
but... I did shoot him.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.173
I deserve to be held
responsible for my actions.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.634
Even if that means going to jail.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.177
You heard him, other cops.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.470
Let's take him in.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
He doesn't know our names, does he?

18:58.639 --> 18:59.765
I don't think he does.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.853
Wait a minute.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.605
Peter didn't shoot my son.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.148
I did.

19:09.525 --> 19:11.985
Peter was just taking the blame for me.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.737
He's a good friend.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.407
Mr. Brown, what exactly are you saying?

19:17.616 --> 19:21.036
I'm saying that I,
Cleveland Brown, a black man,

19:21.119 --> 19:23.413
shot Cleveland Brown, Jr.,

19:23.497 --> 19:24.915
another black man.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.962
Wait, where did everybody go?

19:30.045 --> 19:31.880
You want to make the media go away?

19:31.964 --> 19:34.216
Just mention black-on-black crime.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.635
Boy, the world we live in, huh?

19:36.718 --> 19:39.096
Brian, reach into Meg's pocket.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.722
Go ahead, Brian.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.891
I... I don't want to.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.269
Cleveland, why did you do that?

19:45.352 --> 19:49.273
Peter, since this is about racism,
why don't we take a slow,

19:49.356 --> 19:52.150
hands-clasped-behind-
the-back walk together?

19:52.234 --> 19:55.195
Listen, I know you wouldn't
have shot Cleveland Jr.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.572
on account of his race.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.699
You shot him because you're stupid.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.659
That's all I'm trying to say!

20:00.868 --> 20:03.203
And I know you don't have
hate in your heart.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.164
You were willing to go to jail
for shooting my son.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.166
You took responsibility.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.877
That's what's important.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.212
So... you forgive me?

20:12.504 --> 20:14.339
Of course I do.

20:14.715 --> 20:17.050
Oh, thanks, Cleveland.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.761
Hey, how you feeling there, champ?

20:19.845 --> 20:20.846
I'm good.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.097
Getting better every day.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.640
Aw, I'm happy to hear that.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.768
Look, I hope you know I'm sorry.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.687
Hey, these things happen.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.480
That's my boy.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.610
- Mr. Griffin?
- Yeah?

20:34.693 --> 20:35.944
Just so you know,

20:36.028 --> 20:37.779
I'm gonna be coming for your ass.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.156
Wh... What's that now?

20:39.364 --> 20:40.824
I'm saying it's on!

20:40.908 --> 20:42.910
You ever feel the cool steel

20:42.993 --> 20:45.662
of a switchblade
pressed against your temple?

20:47.206 --> 20:48.999
Hey, Mr. Griffin,

20:49.124 --> 20:50.250
I'm just kidding.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.585
Or am I?

20:51.668 --> 20:54.171
You're gonna wonder about that,
you fat bitch.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.255
See you later!
