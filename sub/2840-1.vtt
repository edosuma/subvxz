56:45.194 --> 56:47.196
Then we have no
problem, Billy.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.115
No, we don't
have a problem.

56:49.198 --> 56:50.991
I'll be hearing from
you later.

56:51.075 --> 56:52.326
Yes, you will.

56:52.868 --> 56:55.037
Speak to you later.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.132
Is that all?

57:06.674 --> 57:07.675
Yeah.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.760
- Thank you.
- He's waiting.

57:16.892 --> 57:20.563
(phone ringing)

57:24.900 --> 57:28.904
recording: The number you have
reached is not in service at this-

57:36.579 --> 57:39.582
So I called three
times and there's no answer.

57:39.665 --> 57:40.916
Nothing?

57:41.292 --> 57:42.543
So try again.

57:43.252 --> 57:45.921
So you gonna tell me
what's going on?

57:46.130 --> 57:47.465
We've been waiting here.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.175
We're waiting
for Pablo and Glen.

57:49.258 --> 57:51.260
Hey, they're supposed
to be here.

57:51.552 --> 57:53.679
- Where's Pablo?
- I don't know, he's not here.

57:53.762 --> 57:56.056
I trust Glen, you don't
trust Pablo?

57:56.140 --> 57:59.351
Maybe we should just stay put
until they get back, don't you think?

57:59.435 --> 58:02.146
This is where we said we
were gonna meet.

58:02.229 --> 58:07.318
I can tell you we got a bag of
cash here, we got another bag coming.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.403
Sit tight and don't
get nervous.

58:15.075 --> 58:16.619
This is not gonna work.

58:16.702 --> 58:18.871
I mean, what if they got caught
by the police or something?

58:18.954 --> 58:20.206
Like--

58:21.123 --> 58:22.291
I gotta
get out of here.

58:22.374 --> 58:23.375
We've all gotta get
out of here.

58:23.459 --> 58:25.461
Let's give
them 30 more minutes.

58:25.878 --> 58:28.214
He's not here in 30 minutes,
we take our cut,

58:28.297 --> 58:31.550
what's left of it,
and we get the fuck out.

58:31.634 --> 58:34.595
But you're making--
You're beginning to make me nervous.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.472
And we gotta stay cool
right now, man.

58:36.555 --> 58:37.806
Pablo: Yo.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.353
Jesus fucking Christ,
where the fuck have you two been?

58:42.436 --> 58:43.521
Where the fuck you
think, man?

58:43.604 --> 58:45.981
Cops every-fucking-where,
man, we had to take a detour.

58:46.065 --> 58:49.026
Yeah, man, it was a landslide
or earthquake some shit

58:49.109 --> 58:52.321
and traffic is bad, cops
trying to kill us, and all kinds of shit.

58:52.404 --> 58:54.073
Oh, that is fucking beautiful.

58:55.783 --> 58:57.785
- A hard day's work, baby.
- Yeah.

58:57.868 --> 58:58.953
It's all fucked up.

58:59.036 --> 59:00.329
Yes, sir-- yes, sir.

59:00.412 --> 59:01.789
- Not bad, right?
- There it is, it's green and it spins,

59:01.872 --> 59:03.123
and it's good.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.291
Right?

59:04.375 --> 59:05.376
Where's the fucking
money, huh?

59:05.459 --> 59:06.460
Glen: What?

59:06.544 --> 59:07.545
What are
you talking about?

59:07.628 --> 59:08.754
Where's the fucking money--
That's not it.

59:08.837 --> 59:09.880
Glen: This bitch
is talking to me?

59:09.964 --> 59:11.924
"Is this bitch talking to me?"

59:12.007 --> 59:15.261
Mike: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

59:15.344 --> 59:16.595
What is this?

59:16.679 --> 59:18.013
What's this, what's this?

59:18.347 --> 59:20.015
What are you talking
about man?

59:20.099 --> 59:21.517
- Money.
- Where's the rest of it?

59:21.600 --> 59:22.810
What's wrong with you?

59:22.893 --> 59:24.144
Mike: Go ahead, look at the bag
and look at this bag.

59:24.228 --> 59:25.229
I mean, where's
the rest of the money?

59:25.312 --> 59:26.313
You guys stash it?

59:26.397 --> 59:27.481
I don't wanna look at shit, man,
I don't want to look at you either.

59:27.565 --> 59:29.441
What is wrong--
Who is this motherfucker?

59:29.525 --> 59:30.526
Why'd you bring him
over here?

59:30.609 --> 59:32.611
Mike, it's good,
it's all there.

59:32.945 --> 59:34.196
All right?

59:34.446 --> 59:35.948
- No, I'm not stupid, all right.
- Everybody be cool.

59:36.031 --> 59:37.116
Nobody's
calling you stupid, man.

59:37.199 --> 59:38.784
Look at how light this bag is,
and look how heavy mine--

59:38.867 --> 59:40.494
If it's green and it spins, then it's good,

59:40.578 --> 59:42.746
and the rest of it
is in your fuckin' ass, I guess.

59:42.830 --> 59:43.956
Mike: What the fuck is this--
You think I'm some--

59:44.039 --> 59:46.834
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up!

59:46.917 --> 59:48.127
Where the fuck is the rest
of the money at?

59:48.210 --> 59:49.461
Mike, relax, man.

59:49.712 --> 59:50.963
Trust me, relax.

59:51.046 --> 59:52.256
Shut the fuck up
and sit the fuck down.

59:52.339 --> 59:53.382
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.801
- Yo Mike, man, it's cool.
- Pablo, shut the fuck up, I'll shoot you!

59:55.884 --> 59:57.553
Shut the fuck up
and sit down!

59:57.636 --> 59:58.971
Where's
the fucking money, huh?

59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.598
You did take it, didn't you?

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.516
Whoa, hey, baby, baby, calm--
Baby, calm down!

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.601
You did take it!

01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:04.935
(everyone shouting)

01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:07.771
This is not it--
Where's the fucking money?

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.857
- You got--
- Where's the fucking money?

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.859
- You did take it!
- Put the gun down!

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:12.943
You did, didn't you?

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.862
- Where's the money?
- I'll kill you by looking at you, bitch!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:15.946
I'll kill looking
at you!

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.031
Get your bitch man.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.992
Put your gun down,
I'll kill by looking at you.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.077
I'll look at you and kill you.

01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.412
I'm a killer!

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:24.788
I kill people.

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:27.082
You pull a gun on me,
you god damn whore?

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.751
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.836
Look, man, I just
want my fucking money!

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.254
Calm the fuck down!

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.799
We gonna split this shit up, we gonna
get the fuck out of here, all right?

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.217
Good idea he's got.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:40.179
Let's cut the money up
and let's go.

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:43.098
Okay, come on,
let's get paid, all right?

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:44.183
Y'all ready to get paid?

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:45.267
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:46.352
- We got it, we did it.
- Let's go.

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:47.478
Yeah, let's go.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.812
Let's go.

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.899
Motherfucker!

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.235
(cackling)

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:57.613
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.698
Oh, my gosh, I just killed
three people.

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.158
(laughing)

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.787
Fucking asshole.
(thumping)

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.373
I couldn't kill her
looking at her,

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:08.791
but I had to shoot her.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.209
Some things never
change.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.419
You know
what I like, Pablo?

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:13.504
I like winning.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:14.838
I like pussy.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.466
I like beer, too.

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.052
I like you.

01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:21.553
Now,
listen to me.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:23.347
I like you right now.

01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:24.973
But just right now.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.434
Yeah?

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.519
- Yeah.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:29.895
We still have
a million dollars.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:30.979
- You know where it is.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.064
- So we're down, right?
- Yeah.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.148

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.198
- But let's keep it that way.
- Yeah.

01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:44.034
- I like you.
- You're fuckin' crazy man.

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:45.369
Let's keep it that way--
Let's keep it that way.

I like you,
Pablo, I like you.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.457

say right before they're killed.

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:33.084
Martinez arranged through his Mexican
connections to get him a kidney.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.841
The same kidney that you
let slip through your fucking hands.

01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:44.929
Now, don't ask me why.

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:50.476
But I cannot nail Martinez unless
Esteban gets that kidney.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:56.065
So I need you to find that
kidney and get it to Esteban.

01:30:37.266 --> 01:30:38.600
I mean, they bandaged
me up.

01:30:38.684 --> 01:30:40.894
I mean...
nothing but a flesh wound.

01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:42.646
I should be all right.

01:30:52.573 --> 01:30:55.576
You know when I first
got out of jail?

01:30:58.579 --> 01:31:01.915
I kinda felt like there
was nobody there for me.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:07.463
I felt like my daughter didn't even
know who her father was.

01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:14.011
I kinda felt
the same way about you, too.

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:17.681
Nah.

01:31:21.101 --> 01:31:25.772
When you were locked up,
I was locked up.

01:31:26.607 --> 01:31:29.610
I felt like I was
in prison every day.

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:34.031
I couldn't stand to see
you in there.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:35.741
You didn't
do anything.

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.701
You know?

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:40.370
That hurt me
the most.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.751
We blood.

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:55.844
We blood...
And that's that.

01:31:56.887 --> 01:32:01.558
Always have your back, I'll be here for you,
even when I'm not around.

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:06.021
Tre.

01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:11.902
Thank you.

01:32:13.403 --> 01:32:14.655
For what?

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:18.408
Everything.

01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:25.999
Thank you
for everything.

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.214
That's what I'm
here for, bro.

01:32:34.925 --> 01:32:36.176
Look, uh...

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.805
Do me a favor.

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:41.765
Sit tight, alright.

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:44.101
I don't want you to
move too much.

01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:47.854
I'm going to run in
the crib and pick up something.

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:52.943
See, all this time, I've been working and
putting together some money.

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.114
I got enough
for us to start over.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:59.741
I got enough.

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:04.288
It's gonna be
all right.

01:33:06.665 --> 01:33:08.000

Tre: I still never really figured out
what they meant by the code 5-1-3.

01:38:36.202 --> 01:38:39.164
For what I understand
or believe it to be,

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:42.918
it's the name the Feds used
when dealing with this operation.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.713
When I looked it up, it read:

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.550
"When a bullet comes
out the barrel of a gun,

01:38:50.634 --> 01:38:53.595
it comes out at 513 degrees
Fahrenheit."

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:57.974
I found it to be ironic.

01:38:58.058 --> 01:39:00.393
That they arrested
my brother on 5/13.

01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:05.315
Looking back, I never
questioned how or why

01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:09.402
the feds were putting so much
pressure on me to help them.

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:13.782
They held my brother over
my head like a dangling carrot,

01:39:13.949 --> 01:39:15.951
knowing that my brother
was innocent.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:21.247
After a four-and-a-half
year full-on investigation,

01:39:21.331 --> 01:39:24.668
the district attorney's office dropped
all charges against my brother.

01:39:27.087 --> 01:39:29.756
A matter of which
I knew nothing about.

01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:33.259
And so the trap was laid.

01:39:34.552 --> 01:39:38.348
I would sign the deal that would
ultimately cause bullets to fly

01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:40.100
and lives to be lost.

01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:45.563
The day my brother
walked into that store,

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:49.401
the bait was set and
5-13 was born.

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:59.619
Lisa, the girl who
shot my brother...

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.623
Just a civilian touched
by the air of confusion.

01:40:06.084 --> 01:40:10.422
Me, I thought I was smarter
that everyone.

01:40:11.965 --> 01:40:13.717
I didn't realize that I was, in fact,

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:18.304
the metaphor of the dog
who ran in circles chasing his tail

01:40:18.388 --> 01:40:21.057
only to be stopped by
his own fatigue.

01:40:22.267 --> 01:40:27.230
And when I open my eyes,
I saw a pregnant girlfriend.

01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:31.359
I figured out something,
though.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:36.948
You have to be
careful of the deals you sign,

01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:39.659
because it's true what they say.

01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:46.666

goes around.
