at the doors of destruction,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.821
uh, go get shmacked, right,

16:27.946 --> 16:29.531

16:35.412 --> 16:37.080
coming up with one
of your creative, crazy ideas

16:37.205 --> 16:38.498
to get those rats out of here

16:38.623 --> 16:40.625

16:45.839 --> 16:47.966
I got it, yeah.
A pizza suit.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.968
Put a bunch of pizza
on this-on a suit,

16:50.093 --> 16:51.595
and then the rats all come to it
and they-and they ge-

16:51.720 --> 16:53.346
They start eating it...
- Oh, that's good.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.806
- And then while they're
eating it, you strip it off,

16:54.931 --> 16:56.808
and you-
you put it on the-

16:56.933 --> 16:59.561
the slingshot from
American Gladiate-Ders, right?

16:59.686 --> 17:00.812

17:06.693 --> 17:08.319
is somebody loco enough to get
in that suit, right?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.070
- Exactly.
- My cousin Danny's loco.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.656
At family barbecues, he'll take
his penis out and put it

17:12.781 --> 17:14.242
in a hot dog bun
and will walk around to my aunt
