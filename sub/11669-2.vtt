00:02.035 --> 00:04.299
- AMY: Roy had the kids, so me and Trev...
- Oh, great.

00:04.404 --> 00:05.803
- We hit the road.
- Fun.

00:05.872 --> 00:06.861
Antiquing.

00:06.939 --> 00:07.929
- Fun.
- Heaven.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.532
- Oh!
- Welcome back, home shoppers.

00:09.609 --> 00:13.841
Over the break, we sold 600
Steve Irwin Commemorative Coins.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.143
- 600.
- Now, this is the perfect gift for someone

00:16.216 --> 00:18.912
who does not have a Steve Irwin coin.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.976
- God, I miss Steve, you know?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.043
You know what's great about him?

00:22.122 --> 00:23.146
- He, he...
- Everything.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.554
- Everything and...
- Yeah?

00:24.624 --> 00:27.092
He had the kind of body
where he didn't work out,

00:27.160 --> 00:29.094
- but it looked like he worked out.
- Sure!

00:29.162 --> 00:30.561
Got one of these for my wife.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.290
Your what?

00:32.698 --> 00:33.757
Okay.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.061
Oh, next up, what do we have?

00:35.135 --> 00:36.397
- Oh!
- Oh, boy.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.663
- Okay, okay.
- Stop.

00:37.737 --> 00:38.931
Now, speaking of perfect gifts,

00:39.005 --> 00:41.599
now, this is a no brainer, all right?

00:41.674 --> 00:43.266
Now, this is a gun.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.709
Just your regular, run of the mill,

00:45.779 --> 00:47.178
meat and potatoes handgun.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.106
- Now, how cute is that?
- I love that.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.444
- How cute... We can pick it up?
- Look at this.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.848
- Oh, heavy, oh...
- Ooh, can I see this?

00:51.918 --> 00:53.510
- You can hold it, sure.
- Oh, wow!

00:53.586 --> 00:55.383
- Look at that.
- Wow, look at that. (IMITATES GUN FIRING)

00:55.455 --> 00:56.786
- Wow!
- Bam-bam, bam-bam!

00:56.856 --> 00:59.484
It's like a toy, but it's extremely real.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.527
Yeah, and now here is
what's great about this.

01:01.594 --> 01:04.563
Now, pretty much anyone can purchase this.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.962
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay?

01:06.032 --> 01:08.432
- Oh, my God, this is so fun, I love this.
- It's fun.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.765
Hey, lady, give me all your
money and your makeup!

01:10.837 --> 01:12.065

01:15.008 --> 01:15.997

01:20.947 --> 01:22.278
- I'm sorry.
- But that's okay.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.337
You want a gun?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.008
<i>Oh, no, I could never get a gun.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.109
<i>I have several violent felonies.</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:28.242
Oh, no.

01:28.321 --> 01:30.118
Caller, you bite your tongue, you silly goose.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.123
You can absolutely get a gun

01:32.192 --> 01:33.454
if you have several felonies,

01:33.526 --> 01:35.858
as long as you buy it on the Internet...

01:35.929 --> 01:37.624
- Right.
- Or at a gun show,

01:37.697 --> 01:41.098
and, caller, guess where you are right now?

01:41.167 --> 01:42.464

01:42.535 --> 01:44.230
Bam! You're at a gun show!

01:44.304 --> 01:45.328
You're at a gun show.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.067
Yes, if you go to a gun show you
can get an unlicensed seller

01:48.141 --> 01:50.405
to sell you a gun, no <i>questiones</i> asked.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.037
That's right, not one question for you, caller.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.838
<i>Great, I'll get one for me</i>
<i>and my mouthy cunt wife.</i>

01:55.949 --> 01:57.780
- Ooh, one's for your wife.
<i>- In a way.</i>

01:57.917 --> 01:58.906
Great.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.850
You know the guns my wife
can't get enough of?

02:01.020 --> 02:02.112
These.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.088
You are really committing
to the whole wife thing.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.488
- She's real.
- What's her name?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.751
Ben...

02:08.527 --> 02:09.859
(IN SPANISH ACCENT) From <i>Espa√±a.</i>

02:09.929 --> 02:13.660
That's fantastic, and just as a reminder
to all the parents at home,

02:13.733 --> 02:16.065
these make perfect stocking stuffers.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.228
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.702
- For as young as...
- Beautiful.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.033
It doesn't matter, okay?

02:20.106 --> 02:22.836
These are great for any age group.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.240
It's like the bottom of the stocking.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.868
- It is, it's shaped...
- It's like the foot.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.071
Very stocking-like.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.239
It's like a metal foot.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.214
- Very stocking-like shape, okay?
- Fantastic.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.614
My wife's in the States, by the way.

02:31.684 --> 02:33.447
I said she's Spanish,
but she is from the States.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.544
Let's keep these calls coming.

02:34.621 --> 02:37.886
We only have 65 million left.

02:37.957 --> 02:39.219
And here's some good news.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.784
Even a blind person can see
what a great deal this is

02:42.862 --> 02:45.228
and take advantage of this
deal by buying a gun.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.424
Totally legal!

02:46.499 --> 02:50.299
So, if you're Stevie Wonder,
you don't have to wonder

02:50.370 --> 02:51.803
if you can get a gun.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.463
Uh, caller, I, I hope you just called to say

02:54.574 --> 02:55.632
you want a gun.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.766
- Stevie Wonder reference.

No one can tell you that
you don't have a right

you're trying to destroy.

- You're funny today.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh!

03:16.162 --> 03:17.322
- Whoa! What is that?
- You know what that means.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.058
Mass shooting. We've had a mass shooting.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.997
Which means the government
could be coming

03:21.067 --> 03:22.591
for your guns soon,

03:22.669 --> 03:25.502
like they never have, but always might.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.561
Scary.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.038
Now, we're gonna go to commercial.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.507
When we come back... Ooh,
you're gonna like this.

03:30.577 --> 03:34.240
We'll be selling United States
Congressmen and Senators

03:34.314 --> 03:36.043
whose influence can be purchased

03:36.115 --> 03:37.377
for much cheaper than you think.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.942
Yes, and they're selling out fast,

03:40.019 --> 03:42.214
ranging from $1,000 to...

03:42.288 --> 03:43.380

Shh...

03:45.959 --> 03:46.948
Shit!

03:48.328 --> 03:51.695
Argh, argh, fuck, fuck!

03:51.764 --> 03:52.822
Oh! Shit!

03:52.899 --> 03:54.389
It was his foot's time.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.835
(MUSIC PLAYING)

04:05.044 --> 04:06.602
There was a shooting at a screening

04:06.679 --> 04:08.647
of the movie I made last summer

04:08.715 --> 04:11.206
and, um, these two girls,

04:11.517 --> 04:13.144
Jillian Johnson and Mayci Breaux,

04:13.353 --> 04:16.151
were shot and killed and, uh,
I just like, was so angry

04:16.221 --> 04:17.279
and I wanted to help.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.057
You know, people are like,
"Ew, like, we don't like

04:21.127 --> 04:23.095
"when celebrities get involved in politics."

04:23.162 --> 04:25.357
And I hear you and I feel the same way.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.991
I remember when Scarlett
Johansson endorsed Obama.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.058
I was like, "Who gives a fuck?"

04:30.136 --> 04:32.161
- Like, why do we care?
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:33.072 --> 04:35.836
Your superpower and your hero
movie is just like

04:35.908 --> 04:37.068
you have a hot ass.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.874
But, I met with people, the victims' families

04:40.947 --> 04:43.347
and they have, like, buttons with the pictures

04:43.416 --> 04:44.815
of their children or their par...

04:44.884 --> 04:46.317
And so, and they're like, "Will you help us

04:46.386 --> 04:47.785
"'cause no one listens to politicians,

04:47.854 --> 04:48.980
"they listen to you idiots."

04:49.055 --> 04:50.147
And what are you gonna be like,

04:50.223 --> 04:52.691
"No, I don't want to annoy people on Reddit."

04:52.759 --> 04:54.852
(MUSIC PLAYING)

04:55.561 --> 04:58.086
Welcome to <i>Chip Chat,</i> here on Geekview,

04:58.164 --> 04:59.995
YouTube channel of the tech blog dorkist

05:00.066 --> 05:01.863
a division of Gawker media.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.434
Recently, Twitter made waves

05:03.503 --> 05:06.028
when they replaced their
"fave" button with a heart.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.630
Here to discuss yet another
addition to their interface

05:08.708 --> 05:11.677
is Twitter's VP of
communications, Cathy O'Doherty.

05:11.744 --> 05:12.836
Thank you for having me.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.611
So, Cathy, tell me about this new feature.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.479
Well, Jared, whether it's
"thumbs up" or "LOL,"

05:17.550 --> 05:19.313
people appreciate having a shortcut

05:19.385 --> 05:21.285
for something they frequently communicate,

05:21.354 --> 05:24.755
and there is one sentiment that
is constantly expressed online

05:24.824 --> 05:26.291
but has never had its own button.

05:26.359 --> 05:30.090
- Hmm.
- That is why we are proud to present this.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.359
Our new "I'm going to rape
and kill you" button.

05:35.768 --> 05:36.894
Interesting, I love this.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.405
Did you know that over 120%
of tweets directed at women

05:40.473 --> 05:42.407
refer to raping andlor killing them?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.466
I never really thought about it,
but it's what I would guess.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.203
Our new button will allow you
to express that notion,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.113
but still free up 30 precious characters

05:50.249 --> 05:51.807
for other comments about that woman.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.286
- Like what ugly sluts they are?
- Bingo.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.787
Let me show you how it works.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.385
Okay, so right now we're
looking at basic cable

05:59.459 --> 06:00.983
and clickbait sensation Amy Schumer.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.325
Yes. Now, before our "I'm gonna
rape and kill you" button,

06:04.397 --> 06:06.092
if you wanted to tell
Amy Schumer that you were

06:06.165 --> 06:07.223
going to rape and kill her,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.734
you would have to hit "reply".
And then fully type out

06:09.802 --> 06:11.360
"I'm gonna rape and kill you."

06:11.437 --> 06:13.564
But now, you can simply click

06:13.639 --> 06:15.732
the "I'm gonna rape and kill you" button,

06:15.808 --> 06:17.776
and Amy Schumer will
much more instantly know

06:17.877 --> 06:19.640
of your threat to rape and kill her.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.770
Very cool.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.508
Very cool, but who is the target user?

06:22.915 --> 06:24.678
Uh, it's typically a guy whose profile pic

06:24.751 --> 06:27.618
is him in a sports jersey with
his child on his shoulders

06:27.687 --> 06:29.450
and a bio that reads "proud Christian."

06:29.522 --> 06:31.854
- Mmm-hmm.
- But also, everyone.

06:31.924 --> 06:32.913
Oh, everyone.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.687
It's been years in the making.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.490
The beta version was simply, "You're fat."

06:36.896 --> 06:37.920
Oh.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.495
But it turns out people
prefer to type that one out.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.330
That way they can spell "you're"
as incorrectly as they want.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.033
Hmm, it is fun to write.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.072
It is the perfect way to rob a stranger

06:47.140 --> 06:49.734
of all her confidence
because you feel powerless

06:49.809 --> 06:50.901
- and invisible.
- Exactly.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.912
But, what's the point of using
the anonymity of the Internet

06:53.980 --> 06:56.505
to just call someone fat when
you can also make them feel

06:56.582 --> 06:58.277
- physically threatened.
- Physically threatened, yes.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.252
That is what "I'm gonna rape
and kill you" is for.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.844
Here's a fun example.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.720
If you read this tweet from
a female video game designer

07:05.792 --> 07:08.784
and you break into cold sweats
of fury and you feel like

07:08.861 --> 07:11.329
someone took a shit
in your pool with their period.

07:11.697 --> 07:15.326
You just lightly tap the button and <i>voila.</i>

07:15.835 --> 07:17.097
JARED: "I'm gonna rape and kill you."

07:17.236 --> 07:19.033
- Exactly.
- It's so easy.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.402
Now, what's next for Twitter?

07:20.473 --> 07:21.997
Any other shortcuts we can look forward to?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.672
Well, nothing that I can make public yet,

07:24.744 --> 07:26.678
but let's just say there's a certain racial slur

07:26.746 --> 07:29.476
that's going to be much easier
to sling in the near future.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.141
Oh, I think I know what it is.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.411
Well, that's all the time we have

07:32.485 --> 07:34.248
on this week's episode of <i>Chip Chat.</i>

07:34.320 --> 07:36.788
You can follow Cathy on Twitter
at the handle below.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.118
(PHONE TWEETS)

07:38.257 --> 07:39.417
Oh.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.084
Someone used the button on me.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.285
That was me.

07:42.361 --> 07:43.953
But I'm not really going to rape and kill you.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.488
Or am I?

16:43.402 --> 16:45.427
We're the nation's largest
gun violence prevention

16:45.504 --> 16:46.903
advocacy organization.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.497
Can you explain to me as if
I'm a 9-year-old...

16:49.842 --> 16:51.275
Mmm-hmm.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.901
What Everytown does.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.277
Everytown is helping create
this really exciting movement

16:56.348 --> 16:59.408
of Americans who are
joining together to help

17:00.085 --> 17:01.916
save lives in this country from

17:01.987 --> 17:04.319
really sad and scary gun violence.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.756
What are the biggest misconceptions

17:06.825 --> 17:08.884
that people have about what you do?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.252
That we're trying to take all your guns away.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.358
Yeah, why would anyone think
that you're just trying

17:14.433 --> 17:15.422
to take their guns away?

17:15.501 --> 17:18.128
You know, I think there were
different points in history

17:18.203 --> 17:19.329
where there were conversations

17:19.405 --> 17:21.066
about banning certain types of guns.

17:21.140 --> 17:24.371
What we're really just trying
to do is improve public safety.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.637
So, we're not talking about
law-abiding citizens'

17:27.012 --> 17:29.105
access to guns and go hunting and shooting

17:29.181 --> 17:30.239
and protect their families, right?

17:30.315 --> 17:31.907
We're talking about terrorists and rapists.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.282
How can you not get burned out and just go,

17:34.353 --> 17:35.547
"Fuck it.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.118
"Everyone's insane.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.445
"They don't want to save lives"?

17:38.524 --> 17:41.425
Actually, my colleagues and I are so inspired

17:41.493 --> 17:44.690
by our work because I've been
in conversations like this

17:44.763 --> 17:47.163
all over the country with
people who you would not think

17:47.232 --> 17:48.961
would be with us, um...

17:49.034 --> 17:50.695
- Like who?
- From Maine to Montana.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.330
Sheriffs and hunters and
conservative elected officials.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.297
- Yeah.
- But we're able to find common ground

17:56.542 --> 17:59.010
because we can all agree that
we should just be doing more

17:59.211 --> 18:00.769
to keep guns away from dangerous people,

18:01.146 --> 18:02.670
so that part's really inspiring.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.340
- So I'm a guy at a bar...
- Mmm-hmm.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.283
And I'm fucking so hot,
and I'm gonna give you my card

18:07.352 --> 18:08.614
and it says, "I'm an NRA member."

18:08.687 --> 18:09.711
(LAUGHING)

18:09.788 --> 18:12.586
What do you, like, what does
that do to you and your vagina?

18:12.891 --> 18:15.917
What's kind of amazing
is that most NRA members

18:15.994 --> 18:18.053
are completely reasonable Americans

18:18.130 --> 18:20.257
like the rest of Americans
who overwhelmingly agree

18:20.332 --> 18:21.697
with the policies that we're pushing.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.265
- Okay.
- But the leadership is crazy town.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.501
Is crazy bad shit.

18:26.572 --> 18:27.698
- Totally crazy.
- Nuts.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.434
There's this great myth

18:29.541 --> 18:31.509
that they are untouchable and unbeatable,

18:31.577 --> 18:34.102
but the fact of the matter is,
they're way too extremist

18:34.179 --> 18:35.168
for the American public.

18:35.247 --> 18:37.272
Give me...
What is the most disturbing statistic?

18:37.349 --> 18:40.682
I think it's that Americans
are 25 times more likely

18:40.752 --> 18:42.344
to be murdered with guns than people

18:42.421 --> 18:43.888
in other developed nations.

18:44.156 --> 18:45.885
Not developing, not third world, like...

18:47.126 --> 18:49.060
Yeah, similar economies, similar lifestyles.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.823
They watch the same Hollywood movies,

18:50.896 --> 18:52.158
they also struggle with mental illness...

18:52.231 --> 18:53.425
Do you think they liked <i>Trainwreck?</i>

18:53.632 --> 18:54.656
Probably, yeah.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.201
Um, so, a lot of people don't know that

18:57.569 --> 19:01.972
gun violence really is
heavily a woman's problem.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.701
- Mmm-hmm.
- Can you talk about that a little bit?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.977
American women are 11 times more
likely to be murdered with guns

19:07.045 --> 19:08.444
than women in other countries.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.912
Um, I mean, the majority of mass shootings

19:10.983 --> 19:13.747
are actually incidents
of family or domestic violence

19:13.819 --> 19:17.380
where an abuser gets a gun
and kills his family

19:17.456 --> 19:18.855
or his ex and her friends.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.551
So, what American women
are really at risk of

19:21.627 --> 19:24.357
is being shot to death and so...

19:24.930 --> 19:28.593
- By their spouse.
- Right, or...

19:28.667 --> 19:29.656
- Or boyfriends.
- Boyfriends.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.032
- Ex-boyfriends.
- Or like, a casual hookup.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.092
Yeah.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.331
Do you want to say anything?

19:33.405 --> 19:35.305
You guys should go to everytown. Org,

19:35.374 --> 19:36.898
you can sign up to join our email list

19:36.975 --> 19:38.567
and learn how to get involved
in your community,

19:38.644 --> 19:40.475
and you need to vote.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.343
It's an election year. It's really important

19:42.414 --> 19:44.382
that more Americans get out there and vote

19:44.449 --> 19:46.474
for candidates who are gonna
stand up for this issue

19:46.552 --> 19:47.541
and fight to end gun violence.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.112
Right, 'cause it's like...

19:49.788 --> 19:51.813
Don't wait till it happens to you or your kid.

19:51.890 --> 19:52.914
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.015
- You know.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.957
You guys are not looking
to take away everybody's guns,

19:56.028 --> 19:57.791
you're just trying to keep guns
away from dangerous people.

19:57.863 --> 19:58.887
Exactly.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.624
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:06.471 --> 20:08.166
So, guns.

20:09.074 --> 20:10.098
Yeah.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.335
What do you think?

20:11.476 --> 20:12.500
I, I wear one.

20:12.844 --> 20:13.902
Do you think people
should be able to get a gun

20:13.979 --> 20:15.446
if they're severely mentally ill?

20:15.647 --> 20:16.705
- No.
- Absolutely not.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.613
Well, then are you willing
to turn in your gun?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.281
No, I'm, I'm a responsible person.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.820
(LAUGHING)

20:23.355 --> 20:25.346
Who do you think should not
be allowed to get a gun?

20:25.691 --> 20:26.919
Anybody?

20:27.292 --> 20:30.921
No, there are rules and
regulations in this country...

20:31.196 --> 20:32.754
- Right.
- And they should be followed.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.163
Do you think a good solution
is to give everybody guns?

20:35.667 --> 20:36.656
No.

20:36.768 --> 20:38.099
What do you think a good solution is?

20:38.670 --> 20:39.967
I'll get back to you.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.806
DIRECTOR: Why didn't you get on the horse?

20:43.875 --> 20:45.399
Because I feel like my character...

20:45.477 --> 20:47.104
(LAUGHING)

20:47.646 --> 20:48.738
Sorry, you just made me laugh.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.406
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:50.816 --> 20:51.976
Twenty-eight-second wave, yeah.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.039
MAN: Twenty-eight-second wave.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.107
WOMAN: Oh, yeah.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.208
Cunts.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.152
(CREW LAUGHING)

20:57.556 --> 20:58.955
MAN: We got that on camera, guys.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.580
Thank you, cut and roll.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.018
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

21:02.227 --> 21:03.285
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

21:06.098 --> 21:07.565
I love the Latina body.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.601
The big ass and the flat chest.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.834
- (LAUGHING)
- Benita.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.371
It's my wife's... (CLEARING THROAT)

21:14.439 --> 21:15.428
Can we go back? (CLEARING THROAT)

21:15.507 --> 21:16.565
Sorry.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.734
(CHUCKLING) I mean...

21:17.809 --> 21:20.004
This gives me a
giant fucking boner, this thing.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.102
AMY: Ew!
