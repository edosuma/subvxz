into a scoundrel.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.625

in the system.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.333
I skirted the man.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.500
I sent a big "eff you"

08:41.500 --> 08:44.834
And now that she's dead,
I'm-I'm ready

08:44.834 --> 08:46.625
to go back to who I was:

08:46.625 --> 08:48.750
an upstanding citizen,

08:48.750 --> 08:51.041
someone who respects
community,

08:51.041 --> 08:52.792

08:52.792 --> 08:56.417
emerging from a chrysalis,
forever changed.

08:56.417 --> 08:59.333
I pledge to you, Mr. Adeeb

08:59.333 --> 09:03.125
and to all the other members
of this big fat marble we're on,

09:03.125 --> 09:08.041

change who I am again.

09:21.750 --> 09:22.208

09:22.208 --> 09:23.583

09:23.583 --> 09:25.792

at Legal Seafoods.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.583
Amy Schwartzman.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.375
- A Jew?
- Mm. She wanted

09:32.375 --> 09:33.917
to move back to Chicago.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.625
So I quit school, followed her,
proposed.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.333
She said yes, if I converted.

09:39.208 --> 09:43.792
So I took off the turban,
cut my hair...

09:43.792 --> 09:45.917

to Jerry.
