<i>A new world enslaved.</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:12.074
<i>This is a land
in need of a hero.</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:13.327
<i>They call him</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:18.204
<i>Machete. Machete.
Machete.</i>

01:20.414 --> 01:22.416
<i>He knows the score.</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:23.842
We need a leader.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.420
We need a revolution.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.176
We need you, Machete.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.349
<i>He gets the space babes.</i>

01:30.924 --> 01:33.052
<i>The people
need us, Machete.</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:34.682
<i>This is a new Network.</i>

01:34.761 --> 01:37.640
It's all galactic and shit.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.647
He thinks he's God
in Heaven.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.274
So Heaven must fall.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.482
<i>And he kills
the bad guys.</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:48.530
<i>Starring Danny Trejo,</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:50.782

03:32.170 --> 03:34.298
Where the fuck are they?

03:35.132 --> 03:37.226
Hands up, assholes!

03:37.300 --> 03:38.973
ICE. You're under arrest!

03:41.972 --> 03:42.973
Stay down!

03:45.308 --> 03:46.309
Immigration?

03:46.768 --> 03:48.145
The fuck is this?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.354
What the fuck
does it look like?

03:49.438 --> 03:50.906
Get your ass
on the ground.

03:50.981 --> 03:54.656
Sweetheart, I'd lose whatever
strapdick you rode in on...

04:01.241 --> 04:03.209
Don't call me sweetheart.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.252
Move and I'll blow
your brains out.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.083
You can't!
You don't have jurisdiction!

04:10.167 --> 04:11.840
We're the goddamned military!

04:11.918 --> 04:15.172
You're selling military
weapons to the cartel.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.925
Did you really think
they were gonna pay you?

04:19.341 --> 04:21.470
You're lucky we got here first.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.523
Cartel.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.304
Where's <i>el cohete?</i>

04:56.379 --> 04:58.052
It's about goddamn time!

04:58.131 --> 04:59.929
You fuckholes were
supposed to be waiting.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.983
Save these two for me.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.287
I know you.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.587
You're Machete.
Enemy of the cartels.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.710
It's my lucky day.

05:30.789 --> 05:35.090
A man who kills a legend
becomes a legend himself.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.931
Who are these guys?

06:02.863 --> 06:03.864
All right, let's go.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.164
No! He said <i>"cohete."</i>

06:05.991 --> 06:08.494
These guys are pros. They didn't come
here for a couple of used M-16s.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.703
Let's go,
it's not worth it.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.459
You're the one that
taught me that the law

06:11.538 --> 06:13.632
and justice aren't
always the same thing.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.627
We gotta stop 'em.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.380
Oh, shit.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.437
I wish you hadn't seen this.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.138
You have the right
to remain silent.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.968
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.313
That is quite
the resume you got there, Taco.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.689
I mean, one might
consider you

07:56.768 --> 07:59.692
to be a bit of an overachiever
when it comes to killing people.

07:59.771 --> 08:03.776
I bet you consider yourself a
mean motor scooter, don't you?

08:04.275 --> 08:06.994
Especially now we
got 24 cartel boys

08:07.070 --> 08:09.368
laid out in pieces
all over my desert.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.575
Well, I got news
for you, Taco.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.707
They was the reserves.
They was the peons.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.715
They're the red-headed mongoloid
runts of Los Cuerpos,

08:18.790 --> 08:21.009
and Los Cuerpos
don't take kindly

08:21.084 --> 08:23.052
to strangers
disciplining their own.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.347
Can I get an amen
on that, Clebourne?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.719
Amen, sir.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.010
See, here's the bad
news for you, Taco.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.597
I'm the only one who plays
vigilante around these parts.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.734
And since you just killed
yourself a Federal officer,

08:38.268 --> 08:43.024
I'm about to have me and mine
a hog-killing good time.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.983
I didn't kill her.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.861
Tomato, tomato.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.948
Let's not get hung up
on the details, shall we?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.453
Drop him, Clebourne.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.908
Well, I'll be goddamned.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.698
They say
he doesn't die, sir.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.448
Been shot, stabbed.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.080
Doesn't ever die.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.706
Bull-fucking-shit.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.255
This Pedro has just
got a thick neck is all.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.057
Sheriff, it's for you.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.889
It damn sure ain't the governor.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.354
It's the President.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.020
The President.
Yeah?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.233
Of course, Mr. President.
Yes, sir.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.469
This is Machete.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.926
Machete.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.344
Welcome to
the White House.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.471
Good thing we got
to you when we did.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.180
Southern hospitality
can be a bitch.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.053
Why am I here?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.638
Right to the point.
I like that.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.849
No bullshit.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.027
I'm a bit of a
no-bullshit guy myself.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.397
So, all bullshit aside...

12:52.480 --> 12:54.858
Get someone else.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.159
We need you, Machete.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.415
We got a situation
on our hands.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.619
There's a revolutionary south of
the border named Marcos Mendez.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.079
You heard of him?

13:07.161 --> 13:09.789
He's crazy.
He's out of his mind.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.465
He's got a missile
aimed at Washington.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.639
He says he's gonna blow us up
if we don't invade Mexico,

13:17.714 --> 13:19.341
clean up the cartels,
and stop the violence

13:19.424 --> 13:20.801
they're spreading
across the land.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.635
What's that got
to do with me?

13:22.719 --> 13:26.769
The basic violation of sovereignty
aside, we can't take the bait.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.985
However, you know Mexico.
Hell, you are Mexico.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.812
I want you
to head back south,

13:32.895 --> 13:36.195
find Mendez,
and just check him out.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.244
But if what
he's saying is true,

13:41.237 --> 13:42.409
kill him.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.875
I'm not interested.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.005
Motherfucker, I'm not asking
if you're interested.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.755
I'm the President of the
United fucking States, man.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.595
Machete don't smoke.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.021
I could just as easily
send you back to your pals

14:07.096 --> 14:08.848
in Hang 'Em High,
Arizona.

14:08.931 --> 14:13.107
The way I see it, you ain't
got much to chew on, hombre.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.112
You know what this is?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.493
Your criminal record.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.993
Do this for us
and, poof, it's gone.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.040
Your past
no longer exists.

14:26.115 --> 14:30.291
In exchange for your services,
I'm making you legal.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.747
You don't have
to sign anything,

14:31.829 --> 14:33.251
raise your right hand,
none of that shit.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.174
I just stamp this
bad motherfucker,

14:37.502 --> 14:40.381
and you are now an official
citizen of the USA.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.562
I just saved you from your noose.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.809
Save me from mine.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.687
Do it for your country,
your new country.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.115
Isn't that what your dead
girlfriend would want?

14:59.190 --> 15:00.988
Agent Sartana?

15:04.654 --> 15:06.531
If you won't do this
for me, Machete,

15:08.157 --> 15:09.909
do it for her.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.509
<i>Your contact
is in San Antonio.</i>

15:22.588 --> 15:25.182
<i>She'll brief you and get you
across the border wall.</i>

15:26.300 --> 15:29.179
<i>Your nation owes you a debt
of gratitude, Machete.</i>

15:29.679 --> 15:31.807
<i>Go kick some ass.</i>

15:32.515 --> 15:36.941
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, El Rey
Network's very own Miss Texas Pageant</i>

15:37.019 --> 15:40.865
<i>presents Miss San Antonio!</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:42.237
Thank you.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.285
What do I believe?

15:45.153 --> 15:47.326
I believe ¡n the word "equality."

15:47.405 --> 15:49.328
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.454
Choose what?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.410
A snow cone, if that's what
she's in the mood for.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.963
I believe in good barbecue, the
two-step, and the right to carry a gun.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.336
World peace?
Sure, why not?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.293
But if we really wanna
talk about world peace,

16:00.376 --> 16:03.220
we have to start by tearing down that
wall that separates us from Mexico.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.298
That wall only enables
us to ignore

16:05.381 --> 16:07.349
the violence and injustice
that is occurring down there,

16:07.425 --> 16:11.726
thus making world peace nothing more
than a beauty pageant pipe dream.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.390
God bless Texas.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.771
Thank you.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.425
You must be Machete.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.929
Blanca Vasquez.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.803
Codename,
Miss San Antonio.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.177
I'll be your handler for the
duration of your assignment.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.227
You get into a stitch,

16:52.303 --> 16:54.021
and I'll be in your ear
with the what's what,

16:54.096 --> 16:56.565
the who's who and the
when's where of it all.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.820
Try not to be distracted by the
cleavage and the hairspray.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.614
It's part of my cover.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.824
This gig keeps me
close to the border

17:09.904 --> 17:12.248
and the designer duds
ain't bad, either.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.040
What happened
to world peace?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.117
Fuck world peace.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.078
The M4 carbine long-range.

17:17.161 --> 17:21.883
It's got reflex sights, micro-polymer
grip, a customized trigger.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.710
Fast enough to nip a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.757
That is, of course,

17:25.836 --> 17:28.259
you happen to come across a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.388
Or, my personal favorite,
the grappler.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.469
Fires up to 30 yards.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.228
Good for when you gotta scratch
those hard to reach places.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.432
I like this.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.519
I like your style.
Low-tech.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.481
But this ain't your
mama's cane cutter.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.990
Consider this the Swiss
Army Knife of machetes.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.696
Machete.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.866
Tell me about Mendez.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.831
Marcos Mendez
is the most sick and twisted

17:57.910 --> 18:00.038
fuckity-fox I've ever
had to keep tabs on.

18:00.121 --> 18:03.250
People down south call him
Marcos the Madman.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.130
He used to run
with Los Cuerpos

18:05.209 --> 18:06.961
until one day
he wakes up

18:07.044 --> 18:10.594
and decides he's gonna turn on the
cartel, fight for the people.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.721
We figure he's laired-up
in the jungle somewhere

18:12.800 --> 18:14.677
since our satellites
can't pinpoint him.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.139
Our only lead is
this prizewinner,

18:18.222 --> 18:20.816
a working girl, goes
by the name of Cereza.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.564
Find her, find Mendez.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.611
Where can I find her?
In Acapulco.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.112
Her information, including the address
to her brothel, is in this dossier.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.567
Uh, uh, uh.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.787
First, I'm gonna need
something from you.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.706
See, even here,
people talk about Machete.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.200
The man.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.545
The myth.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.670
The legend.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.299
I just wanna know the
legend inside and out.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.471
I just lost someone.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.720
Why don't you let me turn that
frown upside down, <i>Papi?</i>

19:32.922 --> 19:34.424
How long
since you've been back?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.843
Since before
the wall went up.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.678
A lot has changed
since then.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.855
It's a run and gun
free-for-all out there.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.682
Acapulco is a war zone,

19:42.765 --> 19:44.438
and we're dropping you
right in the middle of it.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.691
Here. It's a direct
line to yours truly.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.236
You get into a pinch, you just
press pound to phone home.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.659
It's good for calls,
texts, tweets.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.281
Machete don't tweet.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.281
You do now.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.457
You ready for this?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.001
Good luck
on that pageant.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.453
I'm gonna need
a lot more than luck!

20:03.536 --> 20:05.413
Did you see the ass
on Miss Corpus Christi?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.231
All right.

20:31.313 --> 20:35.739
For all of you new girls,
it's peso-pussy Tuesday.

20:35.818 --> 20:41.245
So keep your panties dropped, your legs
spread, and your snatch well-oiled,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.667
'cause you're not walking any
straight lines tomorrow.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.377
As you know,

20:45.453 --> 20:50.084
every jerk-off low-life from
this side of Rio Grande

20:50.166 --> 20:53.670
is gonna pile through that door
as soon as the sun comes down,

20:53.753 --> 20:57.758
so get them off
and get them out.

20:57.840 --> 21:03.938
And, ladies, every stiff pecker
in my parlor pays to play.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.065
No freebies.
Those are house rules.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.439
Doors open
in five minutes.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.774
You're early, handsome.

21:14.857 --> 21:19.283
But then again, the early
bird gets the fresh egg.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.580
I'm looking for a girl.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.204
And I'm looking at a man that
came to the right place.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.535
Pick your poison.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.120
This is the one I want.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.047
Why this one?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.469
Best in Mexico.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.797
Have a seat on the couch,
lover boy.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.757
I'll go fetch her for you.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.376
Where's the girl?

22:07.535 --> 22:11.756
Upstairs. Room six.
But don't go.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.084
You'll miss the peepshow.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.428
I blew my wad,
lover boy.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.225
Get him!

22:37.106 --> 22:38.278
Who the fuck are you?

22:38.357 --> 22:39.483
Machete.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.865
I've heard
Mendez speak of you.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.821
You want to use me
to get to him?

22:46.615 --> 22:47.616
Take me.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.918
Now.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.382
Cereza!

23:00.004 --> 23:02.507
I said no freebies.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.643
You know, the first thing we are
taught is to defend ourselves.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.396
Any one of us
could have killed you.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.896
You think my mom
had bite?

23:13.976 --> 23:16.900
Mendez is gonna gut
you like a game hen.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.731
That was your mother?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.283
You're here to kill him,
aren't you?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.952
Look, don't be
a fucking hero, man.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.452
Mendez is many things, but
merciful is not one of them.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.744
He'll skin you alive for
laying your hands on me.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.670
I'm his cereza,
his virgin.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.841
Mendez isn't who
you think he is.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.466
The terrible things he did, he
did them for the greater good.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.423
All he truly wants
is a better Mexico.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.224
Machete, you have
to promise me

23:46.300 --> 23:48.974
you'll spare his life
and help him.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.058
Please, Machete.

23:52.348 --> 23:56.353
If you've ever loved
anyone, you'd understand.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.702
Do nothing, say nothing,
or you're dead.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.878
Who's this?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.415
New bodyguard.
Mother's orders.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.917
Go ahead, Zaror.
Call it in.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.052
Tell Mendez the muscle
comes or I don't.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.274
Yes.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.071
So here's the thing.

24:41.230 --> 24:45.110
He's lost his mind. There
are two sides to him now.

24:45.442 --> 24:50.118
Some days he's Mendez the
Revolutionary, fighting for the people.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.830
But other days he's
Mendez the Madman,

24:53.909 --> 24:55.877
reliving his cartel glory.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.130
It's a toss-up which
one you're gonna get.

24:58.288 --> 25:02.134
So he'll either hug you
or he'll kill you.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.586
His condition gets worse every day.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.933
The boss has a message
for you, Machete.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.113
End of message.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.299
WOW!

25:48.797 --> 25:51.846
Look what the little
whore dragged in.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.103
Machete Cortez.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.143
Yes, I've heard
your stories.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.143
People still sing
songs about you.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.857
Raise your hand
if you have sung a song

26:05.939 --> 26:07.532
about our friend
Machete here.

26:17.493 --> 26:23.171
Only son of a bitch who gets his
praises sung around here is me.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.837
So tell me, Machete, what did
you think of my Cereza, huh?

26:28.337 --> 26:30.260
It's a shame
I had to let her go,

26:30.339 --> 26:33.183
but by bringing you here
she betrayed me.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.845
She was trying
to save you.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.184
You know what this is?

26:39.056 --> 26:41.684
This is the enema
I plan to fire up

26:41.767 --> 26:43.565
the asshole of
the United States.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.688
Why, Mendez?

26:46.188 --> 26:49.408
Because our people don't
need songs or stories.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.531
They need action.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.074
There's other ways.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.031
The motherfuckers
run this country,

26:56.198 --> 26:59.873
the corrupt politicians,
the media, hiding the truth,

27:00.035 --> 27:03.380
and the cartels killing anything and
anyone who stands in their path.

27:03.539 --> 27:07.043
The US is responsible
for a lot of this.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.928
So since they don't take care
of their part of the problem,

27:10.087 --> 27:12.556
then we will send our part
of the problem to them.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.848
You're crazy.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.386
With a capital
<i>muchacho.</i>

27:18.262 --> 27:20.230
I know why
you're here, Machete.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.604
You work for
the enemy now, huh?

27:22.891 --> 27:24.063
Mmm.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.903
Just another Pancho
doing their dirty work.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.281
I got news
for you, <i>cabrón.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:32.238
Killing me ain't
in the cards.

27:32.401 --> 27:37.749
'Cause I am the ticking, ticking
wrath of Mexico, motherfucker.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.455
Thanks to my good
doctor here,

27:41.535 --> 27:46.462
that missile's system
is linked right into my heart.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.092
So if my heart
stops beating,

27:49.251 --> 27:51.379
Washington will become
the bright shining light

27:51.461 --> 27:53.134
it always thought it was.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.758
Disarm it.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.100
There's only two men in the
world who know how to do that.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.107
Correction, one.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.435
Who's the other one?

28:05.601 --> 28:08.104
The one who created this
beautiful device, of course.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.774
But since he lives in the US,
I'm afraid you are fucked.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.613
Your mission is over,
<i>cabrón.</i>

28:14.276 --> 28:15.619
You have failed.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.328
Machete don't fail.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.336
What you gonna do,
you gonna kill me?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.721
That's a motherfucking
bomb, <i>pendejo!</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:35.763
I'm not gonna kill you.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.264
I'm gonna kill your men, steal your
choppers, get you over the wall.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.515
Leave him to me!

28:41.136 --> 28:43.013
And find the other one
that can disarm you.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.433
Shoot me!

28:53.815 --> 28:57.490
Let me take care
of him. Please.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.019
You won't
make it, amigo.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.851
Even if we get out
of here alive,

29:24.930 --> 29:27.228
my men are instructed
to put a bounty on my head.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.563
$10 million.

29:28.725 --> 29:31.399
We won't survive a mile,
let alone the border.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.321
And the best part is,

29:35.148 --> 29:38.869
the fail-safe on my ticker
here just went live.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.163
You have 24 hours,
my friend.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.582
$10 million! If the assassins
don't get us, the cartels will.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.337
Hell, anyone with
a loaded weapon

29:49.413 --> 29:51.336
and a bill to pay
will make a run at us.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.718
And, boy, it's a long way
to the wall.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.473
Yeah? What's the status?
Is he dead?

30:42.966 --> 30:44.513
I have Mendez
in custody.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.641
In a chopper.
He's alive.

30:46.803 --> 30:47.804
Wait a second.

30:52.309 --> 30:55.313
Machete, what's this I hear about
you having Mendez in custody?

30:55.479 --> 30:57.652
Things got complicated.
No shit!

30:57.814 --> 30:59.532
You were supposed to take him
out, not give him a joyride

30:59.608 --> 31:01.110
on the Good Ship Lollipop!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.495
Damn it, I didn't recruit you
for your sense of compassion.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.655
Machete kills.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.450
That's what he does! He
doesn't save the bad guys!

31:08.617 --> 31:10.290
Now shoot that motherfucker!

31:10.452 --> 31:13.296
If he dies, you die. The
missile is wired to his heart.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.332
Come again?

31:15.499 --> 31:16.967
Machete, can it
be disarmed?

31:17.042 --> 31:18.669
Only where it was made.

31:20.504 --> 31:21.505
VozTech.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.345
VozTech is the biggest weapons
supplier to our military!

31:24.424 --> 31:26.677
You want to bring him all the way
back to the fucking manufacturer?

31:26.760 --> 31:28.762
I need your help
getting him across the border.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.223
This is part of something big.
I can feel it.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.432
Not happening.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.189
Last time I sent a black
op team into Mexico,

31:34.267 --> 31:36.065
they got dead and I got
the Oval ass-fuck.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.487
You're on our own, Machete.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.944
We cannot help you until you're
out of Mexico. You hear me?

31:40.023 --> 31:41.991
Get the hell out of there
as fast as you can!

31:42.442 --> 31:43.944
Machete, double-time it
to the border.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.579
I'll assist you as
much as possible,

31:45.654 --> 31:47.452
but you've got
to move your ass!

33:06.401 --> 33:07.698
Oh, what happened?

33:11.031 --> 33:12.248
You don't remember?

33:14.367 --> 33:16.745
I have this condition,
I'm afraid.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.416
I seem to switch
personalities unexpectedly.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.839
You tried
to kill yourself.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.716
You strapped a bomb
to your chest.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.766
Then it seems events
are already in motion.

33:33.428 --> 33:38.150
I am Marcos Mendez, leader of
the revolution. And you are?

33:38.225 --> 33:40.273
Machete.
Oh, Machete.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.444
I've heard of you.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.897
People sing
songs about you...

33:42.979 --> 33:44.902
We've had this talk already.
Come on, get up.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.451
I didn't hurt anyone,
did I?

33:49.611 --> 33:51.409
You had Cereza killed.

33:56.743 --> 34:00.748
Then I'm a monster
and I must die.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.086
Let's go.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.377
I will lay down my life
for the cause.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.217
And if you choose to
remain in my company,

34:07.295 --> 34:10.139
I fear you will become
its casualty, as well.

34:10.924 --> 34:11.971
Come on.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.434
Should've kept
up with your Spanish there, son.

34:58.513 --> 35:02.518
Sounds like we may be able to
string up this piñata after all.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.228
Let's get on it,
Clebourne.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.485
Sounds like bean-fried Pedros
are back in season.

35:07.564 --> 35:08.781
Come on!

35:19.576 --> 35:21.453
You wouldn't happen
to have a Popsicle

35:21.536 --> 35:22.753
I could stick up
my ass, would you?

35:28.501 --> 35:31.801
A martini. Extra dirty.
Two olives.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.882
All we have is tequila
and Chango.

35:34.883 --> 35:35.930
Right.

35:36.009 --> 35:39.309
For a moment there, I forgot I was
in a black hole of sophistication.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.434
Chango it is.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.644
Although, your limited
selection of Mexican beer

35:45.727 --> 35:46.728
is not what
brings me here.

35:46.811 --> 35:47.983
So what does?

35:48.063 --> 35:49.235
You do, Carlos.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.706
But it can't be.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.324
They say you don't
have a face.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.499
They say you don't exist.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.749
I may not exist,
but this gun does.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.459
You don't have
to do this!

36:05.538 --> 36:08.792
You can tell whoever hired you
that I'll give back the money.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.798
This isn't about
the money, Carlos,

36:10.877 --> 36:12.299
and it isn't about
my employer.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.347
It's about ethics.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.221
Now if I don't shoot you
square in the face,

36:17.300 --> 36:19.553
I would be violating a contractual
obligation and, well...

36:19.636 --> 36:21.684
Please.
Don't beg.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.607
Emotional confrontations
make me very uncomfortable.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.107
How much for
the Change?

36:28.269 --> 36:29.270
50 cents.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.939
I'm gonna give you 75.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.408
Do you have change
for a dollar?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.762
I don't know
where the hell we are.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.475
Excuse me.

37:05.390 --> 37:09.145
We're a little lost. Any chance
you could steer us to León?

37:09.894 --> 37:11.066
I could.

37:11.813 --> 37:16.319
The trouble is, you've seen my
face and I've just changed.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.162
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

37:28.163 --> 37:31.463
It's just a matter of time and
place not meeting in your favor.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.632
<i>I am lost.
Can you help me with directions?</i>

37:43.845 --> 37:46.348
<i>Is there a bus
that goes nearby?</i>

37:54.189 --> 37:55.532
"Maneater."

37:56.024 --> 37:59.494
That's what they used to call me
when I was just a little girl.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.952
I didn't know
what that meant,

38:03.198 --> 38:05.292
but that never
stopped my daddy

38:05.366 --> 38:08.836
from coming into my bed
after a night of drinking.

38:11.539 --> 38:16.466
So, one night, I gave
him what he deserved.

38:17.879 --> 38:21.975
I chewed his balls off
with my teeth!

38:24.719 --> 38:25.936
The next day,

38:26.012 --> 38:30.643
I went to school with pieces
of him still in my braces.

38:32.727 --> 38:38.075
I became what he always
said I was, a maneater.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.865
I despise men.
I can't trust them.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.581
I think that
pussy clouds their minds.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.372
And now my little
Cereza lays dead

38:52.497 --> 38:55.501
because of that reason.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.218
And that's where
you come in.

39:02.924 --> 39:07.555
As random as a selection
as you might be,

39:08.263 --> 39:14.612
you're still a man, <i>Papi,</i>
and I am fucking famished!

39:19.774 --> 39:20.775
Madame?

39:21.276 --> 39:22.323
Yes?

39:22.402 --> 39:23.449
We've found them.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.280
Mendez and Machete.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.914
Bring me my double-D's.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.745
Gather all the girls.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.878
We're going
to avenge my Cereza.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.263
Hey! You want Mendez?
Here I am!

39:44.591 --> 39:46.685
<i>You read
my mind, Machete.</i>

39:47.886 --> 39:51.390
Yup. yup. yup, this is the
perfect place for my last meal.

39:55.143 --> 39:59.319
Give me and my friend here a
plate of your finest cabrito.

40:00.189 --> 40:05.491
And bring some bread and wine,
too, please. Thank you.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.183
See, Machete, you're the
only one who doesn't want me dead.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.620
<i>Puta madre,</i> Machete.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.827
What the hell are you
doing back in Mexico?

40:49.989 --> 40:51.832
Our federales brothers
were very upset

40:51.908 --> 40:54.206
that you abandoned us
in the heat of battle.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.213
I heard you moved to the US and
cleaned rich people's pools, huh?

40:57.372 --> 40:58.794
Put the gun down.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.874
This man's a murderer.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.881
<i>He killed 13 federales
in cold blood.</i>

41:02.043 --> 41:04.387
13 crooked federales.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.719
Dirty lint in
Los Cuerpo's pocket.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.724
How the fuck do
you know that, <i>puto?</i>

41:08.883 --> 41:10.226
I was undercover.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.432
An agent?

41:12.845 --> 41:14.062
There's no agents
in Mexico.

41:14.222 --> 41:18.728
You're looking at Mexico's first,
last, and only secret agent.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.315
Give me one
fucking good reason

41:20.395 --> 41:22.238
I shouldn't shoot him
like the dog that he is.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.900
If he dies, thousands in
Washington die with him.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.068
And if he lives?
How many more will die?

41:27.235 --> 41:28.657
And why help the US?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.743
'Cause I'm the only one
who can.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.750
You were always
the sensitive one, Machete.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.497
Bloody hell!
It's a Mexican stand-off!

41:38.871 --> 41:39.963
I'm taking him in.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.336
Oh, really? Where?

41:41.499 --> 41:44.002
You will take me straight
to the cartels.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.846
Machete.
This man is a dirty cop.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.344
Shut your fucking mouth!
Shut up, <i>loco!</i>

41:49.424 --> 41:51.267
You shouldn't have
said that, <i>amigo.</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:58.274
Because if you call me loco, then
I'm afraid <i>loco</i> is what you get!

42:09.444 --> 42:10.696
Hello again, Machete.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.030
Say one more word!

42:12.196 --> 42:13.573
Let's make a better
Mexico, Machete.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.704
All you have to do is pull
that fucking trigger. Come on.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.287
Come on!

42:26.627 --> 42:27.719
See, Machete?

42:28.713 --> 42:31.557
Justice and law aren't
always the same thing.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.236
What the fuck
is going on here?

42:45.354 --> 42:46.697
Where's my cabrito?

42:49.317 --> 42:50.318
Machete!

43:36.155 --> 43:37.532
Hola.

43:49.210 --> 43:50.803
Ah, look at me,
top scores.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.465
Forgive my excitement, but I'm
just learning to speak Spanish.

43:53.631 --> 43:57.135
Not by choice, but I can't get the,
uh, CD to change for the life of me.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.224
But fuck it.
When in Rome, right?

43:59.387 --> 44:02.812
Well, I'm trying to find a
place called Villa Guerrero.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.642
Perhaps you've heard of it?
<i>No sé, señor.</i>

44:04.725 --> 44:07.478
You haven't heard of it, or "no sé,"
you don't understand the question?

44:11.482 --> 44:13.735
Allow me to use
a more useful illustration.

44:14.735 --> 44:16.157
I'm really trying here.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.994
And if you say "no sé"
one more time,

44:19.073 --> 44:21.872
I'm gonna put a bullet in your
brain out of sheer frustration.

44:23.411 --> 44:26.585
Now then, Villa Guerrero?

44:32.420 --> 44:35.765
Your sense of direction doesn't
inspire confidence, señor

44:38.593 --> 44:40.345
Allow me to translate.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.115
Damn. I was just starting
to get used to this face.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.094
Ooh.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.320
<i>Muy bien,</i> indeed.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.174
<i>El doctor.</i>

46:00.091 --> 46:01.263
Come quick.

46:04.512 --> 46:07.106
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm performing surgery.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.602
Put him in the bed there.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.031
Where are they?
Still inside.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.316
Okay, you two
take the rear.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.054
Machete!

46:39.380 --> 46:40.723
Come out and play!

46:41.716 --> 46:43.309
It's time
we had another fling!

46:43.718 --> 46:46.221
And bring that
baby-killer Mendez!

47:01.736 --> 47:03.659
Pucker up, lover boy.

47:04.572 --> 47:05.619
Suck on this!

47:25.426 --> 47:27.428
Ugh, that's disgusting!

47:40.858 --> 47:42.986
So I'm still alive.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.989
Good for you, Machete.
Good for you.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.332
This is the crazy
you talking?

47:50.159 --> 47:52.958
I can't continue to
live my life like this.

47:53.162 --> 47:54.914
You used to be cartel.

47:55.915 --> 47:58.259
And then you became
a revolutionary.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.175
Why?
I was never cartel.

48:03.422 --> 48:06.596
I was a secret agent
for the Mexican government.

48:07.593 --> 48:11.268
<i>My mission was
to infiltrate Los Cuerpos.</i>

48:11.680 --> 48:13.603
<i>I had to see things.</i>

48:14.600 --> 48:16.523
<i>I had to do things.</i>

48:17.186 --> 48:21.282
I had to watch people die in
ways that no man ever imagined.

48:21.524 --> 48:25.950
<i>Compromising everything I
believed, I became one of them.</i>

48:27.363 --> 48:29.081
I remember calling
my supervisor,

48:29.156 --> 48:31.705
telling him that
I wanted out,

48:31.784 --> 48:33.502
that I wanted
my life back.

48:34.954 --> 48:37.127
<i>What I didn't know,
he was dirty.</i>

48:38.124 --> 48:40.297
<i>He had been bought
by the cartels.</i>

48:40.960 --> 48:43.964
<i>They took me to
the killing room</i>

48:44.046 --> 48:46.469
<i>where my wife
and daughter were waiting.</i>

48:47.800 --> 48:49.222
<i>And they made me watch</i>

48:51.303 --> 48:55.900
as they beat them,
tortured them.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.061
<i>And then it happened.</i>

48:59.979 --> 49:02.573
<i>The Madman took over
for the first time.</i>

49:02.898 --> 49:07.825
<i>My wife and baby girl died because I
trusted a system that did not exist.</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:11.790
<i>I realized that if I was
ever going to change Mexico,</i>

49:12.700 --> 49:14.543
I must do it myself.

49:14.994 --> 49:16.337
<i>I started my own revolution</i>

49:16.412 --> 49:20.883
<i>against every single rotten motherfucker
responsible for this violence.</i>

49:21.584 --> 49:23.586
<i>I will die to see it through.</i>

49:25.337 --> 49:28.181
The real tragedy
in it all is that

49:28.257 --> 49:30.851
people will never know
the truth about me.

49:31.510 --> 49:35.105
How about you? Does anybody
know the real Machete?

49:35.598 --> 49:38.568
Where's your partner?
Every cop has a partner.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.691
You couldn't keep
them alive, could you?

49:41.061 --> 49:42.563
Think about it.
How old are you?

49:43.230 --> 49:46.609
In your line of work, why
have you lived so long?

49:47.651 --> 49:50.746
Your partners knew about
self-sacrifice for the greater good.

49:51.238 --> 49:52.490
Not you, though.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.495
You know what
you are?

49:54.825 --> 49:55.997
Vengeance.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.080
You are vengeance.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.332
And vengeance never dies.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.176
It only changes targets.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.137
Blessing in disguise,
<i>chacho.</i>

50:10.299 --> 50:12.848
You'd never make it past the
wall in this piece of shit.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.513
You need a stronger vehicle,
an armored vehicle,

50:15.596 --> 50:17.439
and I know where
we can get one.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.767
Small town near
the border.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.527
There's a chop-shop there.

50:25.272 --> 50:26.489
<i>Satellite feed coming online.</i>

50:27.191 --> 50:29.910
Once he crosses the
border, we can move in.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.383
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

50:45.209 --> 50:48.429
Come on, you want to get
across that wall or what?

50:48.504 --> 50:49.630
This is cartel turf.

50:49.672 --> 50:52.050
You led us right to 'em, you
crazy son of a bitch! Shh.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.476
No, no, no, no.
Be quiet.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.895
They're all around us.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.394
Waiting.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.643
Lurking.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.821
We're looking for a ride.

51:12.987 --> 51:16.332
Well, this ain't Enterprise
fucking Rent-A-Car.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.501
These are custom orders.

51:19.660 --> 51:21.458
I would do as
he says, <i>Grasa.</i>

51:21.620 --> 51:24.294
Well, look at this.

51:24.456 --> 51:28.586
Marcos Mendez
in the flesh.

51:28.752 --> 51:29.753
This will do.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.180
No shit it'll do.

51:31.338 --> 51:34.012
That baby's my
fucking masterpiece.

51:34.633 --> 51:37.136
Could take her through a
minefield without a flat tire.

51:47.521 --> 51:48.693
Cartel!

51:51.817 --> 51:52.864
Easy, <i>hombre.</i>

51:53.527 --> 51:56.701
You wouldn't shoot a man in
a wheelchair, would you?

51:58.198 --> 51:59.324
No.

52:14.715 --> 52:16.558
I'm jealous.

52:45.204 --> 52:46.831
Go, Machete, go!

52:54.755 --> 52:56.883
<i>Hola,</i> motherfucker.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.184
<i>Let's go to the nude beach.</i>

53:30.249 --> 53:31.922
Hey there, lover boy!

53:37.464 --> 53:38.807
Ladies, give them hell.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.684
Save lover boy
for Mama.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.602
I have a special package
for him.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.976
Killjoy, give me
my strap-on!

53:57.651 --> 53:58.994
Grab the wheel.

54:04.992 --> 54:06.335
Get out!

54:22.134 --> 54:23.852
Fuck!
<i>You're dead.</i>

55:08.555 --> 55:11.900
Fuck, Machete!
You're crazier than I am!

55:12.351 --> 55:15.070
Crazy like
a gypsy fuck, man!

55:15.687 --> 55:17.155
Oh, what you gonna do?

55:17.231 --> 55:19.074
Drive through it? It's solid concrete.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.568
Machete, what the hell
are you doing?

55:21.735 --> 55:23.829
Even Jesus couldn't get
through that damn wall!

55:23.904 --> 55:25.702
Do you know another way?
There is no other way!

55:25.864 --> 55:28.708
That's why they call
it a wall, God damn it!

55:29.243 --> 55:30.665
I know a way.

55:30.828 --> 55:33.047
See that graffiti tag
on the wall?

55:33.580 --> 55:35.048
Drive straight for it.

55:35.207 --> 55:38.427
An inch to either side and they'll
be scraping us off the cement.

55:38.585 --> 55:39.757
Which Mendez are you?

55:39.920 --> 55:42.548
The one who wants to help
you get across the border.

55:42.631 --> 55:43.928
Hit it!

55:51.598 --> 55:54.272
We built the tunnels
when they built the wall.

56:16.415 --> 56:17.632
You made it!

56:19.126 --> 56:21.925
Well, sweet Jezebel!

56:22.254 --> 56:25.178
I think we just hit us
a stroke of beaner's luck

56:25.257 --> 56:26.930
running into
you again, Taco.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.890
You know, you and your
compadre are going for about

56:28.969 --> 56:31.097
10 million buckaroos
a head.

56:31.263 --> 56:33.391
I was never straight A's
in algebra,

56:33.473 --> 56:37.819
but that is a shit-fire-fuck-me-hallelujah
lot of money.

56:38.312 --> 56:41.282
I figure we oughta take advantage
of your lucrative predicament

56:41.815 --> 56:43.613
and get us up to squares.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.823
No distractions this time,
right, Clebourne?

56:45.986 --> 56:47.238
That's right, Sheriff.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.447
All right then.

56:49.281 --> 56:50.908
Sayonara, Taco.

57:10.677 --> 57:12.304
Special Agent Mendez.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.515
How many of you
are there?

57:14.848 --> 57:16.475
Sorry, that's classified.

57:19.478 --> 57:20.821
What the hell is that?

57:24.191 --> 57:25.693
My welcome party.

57:31.657 --> 57:33.455
You didn't think
it would all be over

57:33.533 --> 57:35.331
once we crossed
the border, did you?

57:35.702 --> 57:38.296
Who do you think gave me that
missile in the first place?

57:40.707 --> 57:43.506
There is a grand
conductor behind all this.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.220
Zaror! You're alive!

58:30.924 --> 58:33.222
<i>Why re-elect
President Rathcock?</i>

58:33.385 --> 58:36.104
<i>He dished out $6 million
of taxpayer money</i>

58:36.263 --> 58:39.267
<i>to space technology companies
like VozTech Industries.</i>

58:39.433 --> 58:42.903
<i>He built a wall protecting us
from the threat of illegals.</i>

58:43.061 --> 58:47.567
<i>He took a stand and defended our
second amendment with a vengeance.</i>

58:47.941 --> 58:50.945
<i>And to boost our national
economy to an all-time high,</i>

58:51.111 --> 58:54.081
<i>he made marijuana
legal in 48 states.</i>

58:54.239 --> 58:57.459
My fellow Americans, it's
been a groovy four years.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.790
But there is still so
much left to accomplish.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.456
For me, winning was
only the beginning.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.124
Re-elect Rathcock.

59:04.291 --> 59:07.636
<i>A name you like,
a face you can trust.</i>

59:25.270 --> 59:27.272
Don't worry,
Mr. Cortez.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.987
You haven't failed
your mission yet.

59:34.321 --> 59:35.493
Where am I?

59:35.655 --> 59:38.534
Recuperating in my sumptuous
healing pool right now.

59:38.617 --> 59:39.869
Do you like it?

59:39.951 --> 59:40.918
And as you can see,

59:40.994 --> 59:45.841
our friend Marcos Mendez is still
very much alive and ticking.

59:47.459 --> 59:50.963
Which makes him
still very much a threat.

59:51.129 --> 59:52.972
It needs to be disarmed.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.013
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.677
Well, actually, I do.

59:57.135 --> 59:58.478
I invented it.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.688
Allow me to
introduce myself.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:04.268
My name is Luthor Voz.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.278
Let me admit, I've been following
your career for quite some time now.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.860
I am a tremendous fan
of your work, Mr. Cortez.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.651
As an aficionado of
the arts of war myself,

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:15.037
I just gotta say that you
are one genuine article,

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.994
Genghis Khan, high caliber,
fucker-people-upper.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.451
You're a warrior,
Mr. Cortez. A killer.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.542
A survivor. Like me.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.041
Just try to relax.

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:30.711
I mean, if I wanted you dead,
you'd be fucking dead.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.675
Are you gonna
disarm it or not?

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.718
I'm leaning towards not.

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:38.348
But that all very much
depends on you, Mr. Cortez.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.847
You sold Mendez
the missile.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:45.184
No. I gave it to him.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.194
But then, I've given a lot of bad
things to a lot of bad people,

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.230
but that does not
make me one of them.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.858
Get dressed, Mr. Cortez.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.035
Allow me to try
and convince you.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.248
I'll turn my back.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.498
Welcome to VozTech,

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:12.886
the world's premier space technology
and weapons manufacturer.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:15.968
You know, Time Magazine
once called me

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.891
a merchant of death
with an assembly line.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.554
But one very special day,
I began to think bigger.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:28.402
And now I've turned science
fiction into science reality.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:33.406
And this, this is where
we conduct our training exercises.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.693
For what?
Our exodus.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.361
When NASA asked
me to build them

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.617
a new state-of-the-art
luxury spacestation,

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.282
I luxuriously told
them to fuck themselves.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:45.123
Why, you ask? Well, because I'd
already built one of my own.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.754
It's up there right now, just
floating the fuck around,

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.881
waiting for me and my
people to inhabit it.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.917
In fact, Mr. Cortez...
Machete.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.551
Incidentally, Mr. Machete,

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:56.426
I plan on moving into my new
space pad very, very soon.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:58.927
I'm very excited.
Here, have a heart.

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.133
What about the heart?

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.561
Well, that's why
I'm relocating.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:03.928
Climb aboard.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.311
Yes, I'm a <i>Star Wars</i> fan.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.943
Tanks, missiles,
bread and butter.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.238
It's the simple
things that fund

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.657
my more out-of-this-world
enterprises.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.567
Why Mendez?
Why?

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.904
Well, bin Laden is dead

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.705
and America has always
needed its boogeyman,

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.499
so I created a new one.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.667
Yes, I supplied Señor Mendez
with the fireworks.

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:32.628
<i>But given Mendez's
aptitude for the unpredictable,</i>

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.336
<i>I left one of my men
behind to keep me abreast</i>

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.420
<i>of his process
or lack thereof.</i>

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:39.006
<i>What's your plan
have to do with me?</i>

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.675
I have high hopes
for you, Mr. Machete.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:43.969
Higher than you could
mentally ascend to.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.483
A spaceship?

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:53.987
Technically speaking,
space shuttle.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.689
Not to mention,
my legacy.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:58.150
It all started about
six years ago.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:02.116
I privately funded a suborbital launch.
Went up myself.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.832
Yeah, I was something of a
thrill-seeker back then.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.501
Before what I like to
call "the incident."

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:13.499
I was up amongst the stars and
something inexplicable happened to me.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:14.882
<i>I saw the future.</i>

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.714
<i>I saw the world ending.</i>

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.717
It unfolded right before
my very eyes.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.016
And that's why
I built this.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:28.560
Aboard it, me and anyone who wants
to join me will take flight.

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.942
And when kingdom comes,
as it surely will,

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.270
we'll be safe
amongst the stars.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.238
Noah had his ark,
I got mine.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.448
You really believe that?

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.860
I believe what I see.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:46.073
And luckily for you, sir,
I saw you up there with me.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:49.080
I see glimpses
of what lies ahead.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:52.212
It's a condition I was left
with after the incident.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:57.004
Speaking of which, I'd take a
step or two back if I were you.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.050
You ever had déja vu?
Lasts a couple of seconds, right?

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:07.219
With me,
it's been two years.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.726
You don't believe
me now, but you will.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.809
Now if I couldn't
see into the future,

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:16.270
then how could I have
made all these?

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:20.612
Mr. Machete, I present to
you the arms of tomorrow.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.071
Pick your fancy.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.127
And you pick the only one
in the place that's faulty.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.417
I'm sorry, but my molecule
blaster doesn't quite work yet.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.584
It keeps turning
shit inside-out.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.092
Perhaps this is more
your speed anyway.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.302
Primitive, lightweight.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:48.305
Retro, yet high-tech.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.311
Demonstration?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.194
Like it?

01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:59.486
Yes.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:00.647
It's yours.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:04.284
And now, Mr. Machete, if I
could just cut to the rub.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.158
I'd like to recruit you.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.580
You already have
enough men.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.160
No, but not the best
by any means.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.623
How can they be when you so
dominantly claim that title yourself?

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.454
Demonstration.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.167
Good luck.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.707
Encore.
Encore.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.173
Or three?

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:06.053
Genetically engineered
super soldiers, you see.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:07.551
Clones.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.558
Have at 'em.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.389
Just as I predicted.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:53.055
No match for
the likes of you.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:03.611
I created my clones because where I'm
going, I'm going to need an army.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.864
And that poor dead bastard
you met in Mexico, Zaror,

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.192
he was my prototype.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:12.120
But since you fucked him up like a
Special Ed science fair project,

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.823
I'm left to regret
my choice.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.409
You still haven't
told me why I'm here.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:20.704
I need a stronger specimen from
which to draw a new batch of clones

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.336
and I was hoping that you
would do me that honor, sir.

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.759
There is only one Machete.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.462
But what if
there were more?

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:32.057
What if there was an army
of enhanced Machetes?

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.429
Machete, Machete.
Everywhere Machete!

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:38.597
You and I together, we'd be a
force to be reckoned with.

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.940
I'm sorry.
I may have overreacted,

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:52.657
but that numbnuts was about to spill
a bottle of 1787 Chateau Lafite.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.287
No more games.

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:57.115
Disarm it.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.454
Join me.

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.960
Surely you know by now that I
know how all this turns out.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.871
Then you know
I'm taking this.

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:05.005
Oh, and where will you go?

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.799
You know I'm the only
one that can disarm it.

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.715
I'll find someone else.

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.304
Oh, good luck with that.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:13.556
But I think there's one more
little thing you should know.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:16.721
Mendez wasn't
my only boogeyman.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.647
North Korea, Russia,
I have a Mendez everywhere.

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:24.317
And in a matter of hours,
they'll launch on one another,

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:28.354
throwing the world into gargantuan,
unrecoverable anarchy.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:29.947
Too many syllables?

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.323
The world is fucked.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.571
Why?

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.328
This world must end in order for
a more perfect one to emerge.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.491
And like it or not, Mr. Machete,
you're coming with me.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.068
Goddamn, you're good!

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:09.395
Get that bastard!

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.904
Try not to get too many of yourselves
killed in the process!

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:56.072
<i>My molecule blaster
doesn't quite work right yet.</i>

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.491
<i>It keeps turning
shit inside-out.</i>

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.003
What took you so long?

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.921
You're luck I came at all.

01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:51.896
Oh, we'll meet again,
Mr. Machete.

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:55.023
I've seen it.

01:11:57.605 --> 01:12:00.700
Been tracking you since your
bounty hit the airwaves.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.236
Quite a shit-storm you
stirred up down south.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.872
I thought I'd tap in. Couldn't
let you have all the fun.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.459
Hey. I'm sorry
about Sartana.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:12.290
We all are.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.131
She was one
of the good ones.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:19.340
As you can see, the
Network's gone full scale.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.925
We're new and improved.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:25.884
Over 500,000 extractions
and counting.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:30.855
When they put up the wall, we had
to up our game, find funding.

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:36.152
Now, our reach extends all
the way to San Cristóbal.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:38.779
The rules are the same.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.736
You get in,
you gotta earn it.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:43.617
We monitor our members to make
sure they're doing their part.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:47.576
If they're not, I'll deport
their asses myself.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.252
Missing?
All of them?

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:55.747
MIA. Every last
one of them.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.382
One minute they're tearing
ass for the border,

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.552
the next,
they're vanished.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.463
Disappeared without
a trace.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:07.099
It's like aliens abducted
by goddamn aliens.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:09.469
You gotta check this out.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.854
This is the surveillance
footage we got.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.944
We think the same douchebag
that took you took them.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.606
Seems like he's building
some sort of secret weapon,

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.116
possibly needs the Mexican
labor to finish it.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:25.447
It's in space.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:28.204
He wants to get there before
the missiles take off.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:31.036
What missiles? What the
fuck are you talking about?

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.293
Launch trigger is wired
to a biological clock.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.546
We need to find someone
to disarm it.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.089
You got anybody
in the Network?

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.252
Yeah. But you
don't like him.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.722
Osiris.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.195
Come on, Machete,
he's with us.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.696
He's not with me.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.532
He's our only bomb guy.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.662
You wanna choke
him out, go ahead.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.664
I hear it's always
the blue wire.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.162
What's he doing here?

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.497
He came to me about
six months ago.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:21.416
Said he'd changed his tune.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.425
Cabrones ain't got no tune.

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.214
I know that you would prefer
to see me all sorts of dead,

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:30.930
but God has already cursed
me for what I did to Padre.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.094
That's why I'm here.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.854
To finish your brother's work.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.941
My only redemption
is in righting that wrong.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:43.863
So, please, give me mercy and I
swear I will make it up to you.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.857
Or die trying.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:48.609
I'd have it no other way.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.863
This is your bomb guy?

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.869
You can try
the Yellow Pages.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.294
I gotta make a call.

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.626
You'd better be somewhere
with shit reception,

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.548
because I've been trying
to reach you all damn day.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.633
<i>Where's Mendez?</i>
Dead.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.544
But his heart still beats.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.008
<i>You're joking, right?</i>

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.885
Machete don't joke.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.306
<i>Humor me.</i>

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:12.801
Who's got the heart?

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:16.722
Voz. He's bad news. Been using
Mendez to do all his dirty work.

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.810
<i>Machete, I'm gonna stop
you right there, okay?</i>

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:22.227
Luthor Voz may have his hand in a
lot of pockets, but he's harmless.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:24.771
He sponsors my damn
pageant, for Christ's sake.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.071
You need to alert
the President.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.694
<i>Just calm down.</i>

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.610
<i>Tell me your location and we'll
talk about this in person.</i>

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.405
<i>Better meet somewhere else.
Have it your way.</i>

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:36.575
I'm gonna text you a rendezvous point
after my swimsuit competition.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.582
Who's the bitch?

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:45.837
Handler.

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:51.718
You fuck her?

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:56.218
Yeah, you did.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:57.974
What, you got a problem?

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.684
Yeah, I got a problem.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:02.984
When you smell like pussy, it
means you're pussy-whipped.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:05.736
And when you're pussy-whipped,
your judgment's cloudy.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.863
Just jealous.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:11.108
Is that her?

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.111
I thought Machete
don't text.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:18.328
Machete loves everybody.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:21.703
Man, screw this.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:24.671
Where you going?

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.964
With you.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:31.296
It takes a bitch to make a
bitch and I smell fish taco.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.468
Tito, Osiris.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.259
Taco time.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.286
What do you know?
I won.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:04.913
Congratulations.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.497
It's exciting, right?

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:08.833
You're looking at
the new Miss Texas.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.000
Who are they?

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.171
Listen, cariño, I would love
to stay and chit-chat with you,

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.431
but not while there's a live
missile inside state lines.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:16.806
So would you please,
pretty please,

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.010
get into the car and debrief
me on your mission?

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:22.180
If that's even what you'd like to
call your blood-splattered fiasco.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:23.939
How'd you know?
Know what?

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.100
The missile.
That it was here.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.029
Look at you.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.574
Smarter than
the average Mexican.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.200
You work for Voz.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:39.113
I promised to turn you over to Voz
and Voz promised me the crown.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.955
See, I can't really
sing or twirl a baton,

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:45.954
but I can win.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.540
Oh.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.466
<i>Papi,</i> I'm sorry.

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.966
You and I really could
have had something,

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.924
but I just love killing
a good romance.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.222
Make it count.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.755
I knew I smelled bitch
in the air tonight.

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:32.542
Payback's the only bitch
you need to worry about.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.757
This dress costs more
than your fucking life!

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:41.096
Didn't anybody ever tell you not
to wear a dress to a gunfight?

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.517
Oh, baby, I always
dress to the nines.

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.183
I dress to kill.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.354
Wait, no, wait!
No, wait!

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:09.374
Where's Tito?
He's down.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.807
Go, I got this.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:28.897
How many do we got?

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:41.652
Fuck!

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:49.998
He's on the roof!

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.503
Yeah, no shit
he's on the roof!

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:55.132
Will one of you please get
him off the roof... Shit!

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:57.967
For crying out loud,

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.886
will one of you well-paid,
well-trained

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.056
gentlemen please shoot
that motherfucker?

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.551
Thank you!

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.706
This is the President.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:29.742
<i>Mr. President,
it's Miss San Antonio.</i>

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.203
<i>Machete never showed
up to the rendezvous.</i>

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.462
<i>I just hope
that he's still alive.</i>

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.962
<i>It doesn't matter.
It's not worth it. Let's go.</i>

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.140
<i>Aren't you the one that
taught me that the law and justice</i>

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:45.761
<i>aren't always the same thing?</i>

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:48.010
<i>We gotta stop 'em.</i>

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.643
Fuck it.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:18.518
Who am I kidding?

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:27.948
I really must hand
it to you, mi amigo.

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.988
You are a difficult man
to catch up with.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.786
You have no idea what I
went through to get here.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.998
Hours, I spent stranded
on that desert highway

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.414
until this holy rolling
rig came along.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:50.175
Lady. Please. Help me.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.810
You and all your drug-pushing
compadres just derailed my pursuit,

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:58.016
so frankly, I'm leaning in
another direction entirely.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:22:59.315
Give me mercy.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.819
There's about three things
I'd rather give you

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:04.147
and they're all in the
chamber of this gun.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.532
Straight up?

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:09.238
Or with some flair?

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:11.946
Straight up?

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.948
Or flair?

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:17.042
Whatever is the more
interesting way to die.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:25.129
Weirdo.

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:48.775
You know, I rather
enjoy my new disguise.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.575
I must apologize for making
you dig your own grave.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:56.411
It's appalling, not offering you
a more professional courtesy,

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:58.575
but I'm not
one for hard labor.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:02.872
You on the other hand, being Mexican
and all, you must be used to it.

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:04.414
And...

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:09.837
Holy fucking
underground tunnel!

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:26.277
People!

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.488
Did you see the Mexican guy?

01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:30.156
Drop it!

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:34.282
Reach for the sky before I put
that illegal face in a tussle.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.454
You have it all wrong.
This is all a big mistake.

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:43.837
Only mistake you made was dancin'
across that border, muchacho.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.873
No, no, you don't understand.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.295
I am no Mexican.

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.426
Don't move your hands, amigo!

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:53.806
Sir, really, listen
to my voice.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:55.799
Do I sound Mexican?

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:58.219
I am from Ontario,
for fuck's sake!

01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:01.305
Canadian and Mexican.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:03.064
Double-whammy.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.608
Smoke this fool!

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:49.982
Get him some water!

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:52.439
No time for water.

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:57.695
Doc Felix needs to see him right away.
Machete!

01:25:58.612 --> 01:25:59.864
You're back.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.497
Sorry if I smell.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.210
Did you know the average person
passes gas 14 times a day?

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.048
It's true.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.544
Our target, Luthor Voz.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.884
The same proper fuck who's
been jacking our members.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:20.551
As we speak, he's got a missile
pointed right up our ass.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:26.891
And since it looks like no one else
is gonna stop him, it's on us.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:30.402
Machete's mission with Voz
has nothing to do with us.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.483
We are the Network.

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:34.068
Our mission is Mexico.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.904
Our mission has changed.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:37.238
He's right.

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:38.568
I'll go it alone.

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:40.996
You're not going anywhere
without me, cabrón.

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:43.077
No time to argue.

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:45.116
Fuck that.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.004
Let me explain
something, mi gente.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.666
This isn't about
Mexico no more.

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:53.751
It's about the world.

01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:57.759
No world, no Mexico.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.260
Count me in.

01:26:59.423 --> 01:27:01.346
Me, too.
Me, too.

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:03.351
Ditto.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:05.595
Viva Machete!

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:11.276
Looks like
it's settled, Machete.

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:12.944
When do we hit 'em?

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.650
Tonight.

01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:24.493
<i>Network-1 in position.</i>

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.329
Network-2 in position.

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:28.414
Copy that.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.585
Here you are.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:32.122
Thank you.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:52.776
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, your host, Voz!</i>

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.532
My fellow travelers,
my friends,

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:12.630
I proudly present the Millennium-1
ready to launch right on schedule.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.131
Now before long,

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:18.635
we'll be transported to the heavens on
a maiden voyage of Titanic proportion.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:21.296
And once the world is purged,

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:26.601
we'll return to bring about
a new world together!

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.479
In a moment, the boarding
process will begin.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:37.358
But first, my friends,
prepare for infinity!

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:40.820
Reveal your new selves to me!

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.418
Why don't you
tell them the truth?

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:58.588
Tell them you orchestrated all this.
The missiles, the heart.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.755
Would someone please help the help?
He seems to be lost.

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:06.971
Tell them if the world ends,
you're the one who ended it.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.604
How can this be? This isn't
supposed to be happening.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:13.106
No, this isn't supposed to be...
I never saw this.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.897
Machete happens.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.070
Look, this is no time
for second thoughts.

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:21.774
The end is near,
I assure you.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.283
For you.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:25.443
Let's do this.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:37.923
Well, ladies and gents, I had hoped
to have an uninhibited evening,

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.214
but now it seems...

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:42.878
Guards!

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.981
What about Voz?
We find the heart first.

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:00.487
After you, chief.

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:10.159
Motherfuckers!

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.127
What the beating
fuck is that?

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:23.760
Yeah, I'm more of a cherry bomb,
matchstick kind of guy, you know.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:27.423
Semtex, TNT.
50-50 shot on a good day.

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:30.968
But this... I mean, high
octane organs ain't my bag.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:33.637
Then what good are you?

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:46.028
Never mind.
We're live.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.991
It's a shame I have to kill you now,
Mr. Machete, but if you gotta go,

01:30:55.325 --> 01:30:56.827
go inside-out.

01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.544
No!

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:01.715
We're even.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:53.258
Well, what can I say?

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:58.059
I suppose we both like getting
our hands a little dirty.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.611
You can't beat me, you know.

01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:13.745
I know your every move
even before you do.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:22.170
Nobody knows Machete.

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:24.122
That's true.

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:29.511
Ever since I met you, the future has been
more unclear, and that, that puzzles me.

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:34.929
But then I figured it out.

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.807
There's just not a whole lot
going on up there, is there?

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:46.152
I admit, I may not be able to
predict you as accurately now,

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:51.942
but I assure you, I'm every bit
as merciless as what you are.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.285
Demonstration?

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.579
Keep fighting, God damn it!

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:44.328
Preach it, sister.

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:51.046
How poetic.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:54.383
Now you really are
the blind leading the blind.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.738
Round them up, let's go!
Get them on the shuttle now.

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:15.108
And someone find Voz.

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:47.765
All right, folks,
let's keep it moving.

01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:50.936
Form a single-file line,
one after another. Thank you.

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:54.773
<i>Missile launch in T
minus two minutes.</i>

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:57.909
One after another.
What the hell?

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:04.120
Keep your hands in the straps
and hold on tight.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.273
Really?

01:35:38.942 --> 01:35:40.535
You're gonna make
me kill a blind chick?

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:44.330
I'm pretty sure they're gonna
take my crown for that.

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:48.119
That's all right. They'll just give it to
the next bimbo who spreads like butter.

01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:02.640
All right, darling.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.510
You wanna tango?

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:08.850
Let's tango.

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.686
<i>Mano-a-mano,</i> motherfucker.

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:21.276
<i>Missile
launch in T minus one minute.</i>

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:23.327
Watch it now, pussycat.

01:36:23.486 --> 01:36:27.161
That's not a very lady-like
kind of thing to say.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:28.540
I don't do lady-like.

01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:36.508
So what then, you're just a
regular old cranky bitch?

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:38.051
Or is it PMS?

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:40.632
If it were PMS,
you'd be dead already.

01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:58.859
It was fun while it lasted.

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.485
So now what happens?

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:42.115
Ask the last guy
who shot my eye out.

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:58.164
It appears
we have a stray.

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:02.798
And where, oh, where might our mutual
acquaintance be at this moment?

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.428
Pissing on your sunny day.

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:06.260
You fucked with
the wrong Mexican.

01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:07.719
Indeed I have.

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:10.268
However, in 20 seconds,
none of that will matter,

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:14.476
but you, well, you're looking at
a pickle any way you slice it.

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:17.438
I can't see, but I could
still kick your ass.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.819
That's why I'm taking
you with me.

01:38:24.774 --> 01:38:26.071
Ah!

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.823
Load her onto the shuttle.

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:40.669
Bring them.

01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:43.627
They can join the other
laborers we abducted.

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:47.673
There'll be plenty of work
to be done up there.

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:52.014
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:57.687
<i>I apologize in advance for the discomfort
you may experience during our travels,</i>

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:00.352
but we are unforeseeably
overbooked.

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:05.194
So please hang on and try
and enjoy the flight.

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:11.700
See you in space,
Mr. Machete.

01:39:58.576 --> 01:40:00.749
Get the fuck off that man.
He just saved the world's ass.

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:06.376
Machete, I got your message. We
were able to stop the other missiles.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:08.044
Where's that
son of a bitch Voz?

01:40:11.088 --> 01:40:13.021
Are you telling me
that turkey is just up

01:40:13.047 --> 01:40:15.118
there floating around
with weapons and shit?

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:20.140
I got a wild idea.
Just hear me out.

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:25.111
I can put you on a SpaceX
rocket, top of the line.

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:29.111
You go up into space.

01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:30.570
I'll do it.

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:33.907
I'll do it.

01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:36.573
Your country thanks you.

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:48.793
Good luck, Machete.
Get the bastard.

01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:57.320
I'm President Rathcock
and I approve this message.

01:47:36.992 --> 01:47:39.711
You can't surprise
pussy-punch someone.
