02:09.916 --> 02:11.674
Deeper.

02:12.624 --> 02:14.549
Come on, deeper, deeper.

02:17.166 --> 02:20.631
Come on, deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.

02:22.082 --> 02:24.256
From here, boy, here!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.150
That's it.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.424
Now, loosen up.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.632
Come on, loosen up.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.841
Come on, boy, loosen 'em up.

02:40.042 --> 02:43.733
That's it. Now, on the spot.
One, two! One, two! One, two!

02:43.833 --> 02:47.192
- What are your legs?
- Springs. Steel springs.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.942
- What are they going to do?
- Hurl me down the track.

02:50.042 --> 02:52.483
- How fast can you run?
- As fast as a leopard.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.983
- How fast will you run?
- As fast as a leopard.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.008
Then let's see you do it.

03:15.126 --> 03:17.300
Are you ready, leopard?

03:17.418 --> 03:19.389
On your mark!

03:23.126 --> 03:24.470
Get set!

03:34.419 --> 03:36.391
Come on, boy.

03:38.502 --> 03:40.059
Come on, boy.

03:50.335 --> 03:53.967
- How'd it feel?
- All right.

03:58.169 --> 04:00.556
Nine and five-eighths.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.102
Whoa!

04:19.420 --> 04:22.236
Rusty, you useless mutt!

04:22.336 --> 04:26.403
Get after him, Perce. Where did you learn
to ride? On a rocking horse?

04:26.503 --> 04:28.778
Les! Go and open the gate.

04:28.878 --> 04:31.820
- Black can do that.
- I want you to do it.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.935
- When I'm ready.
- Now!

04:36.712 --> 04:38.612
Les, don't split 'em!

04:38.712 --> 04:40.154
Bastard.

04:40.254 --> 04:42.475
Billy, Zac, bring up the tail!

04:54.129 --> 04:56.303
Get 'em up, get 'em up!

04:56.921 --> 04:58.893
Whoo!

05:02.712 --> 05:03.780
Whoo!

05:03.880 --> 05:07.559
Ha! Hey! A wash, lovely, lovely.

05:09.172 --> 05:13.322
Come on! Leave me alone, will ya?

05:13.422 --> 05:15.905
Hey, Archy, him wash.

05:16.005 --> 05:19.322
Prefer the company
of blacks, hey, Archy?

05:19.422 --> 05:21.927
- Zac's my mate.
- We run together.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.905
You fancy yourself as a runner, eh?

05:25.005 --> 05:27.947
He's more than a runner.
He's top bloody athlete.

05:28.047 --> 05:30.197
Girls run.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.905
Men box.

05:32.005 --> 05:33.905
Lay off him, Les.

05:34.005 --> 05:36.198
He can run faster than you can ride!

05:36.298 --> 05:40.771
Jeez! Is that a fact?

05:41.756 --> 05:43.906
I'll beat you to the home gate.

05:44.006 --> 05:46.281
Me on horseback, you on foot?!

05:46.381 --> 05:49.598
I'll go cross-country,
you take the track.

05:49.923 --> 05:53.489
That's a fair bet.
That track's five miles further.

05:53.589 --> 05:55.182
Yeah, have a go, Les.

05:56.506 --> 06:00.221
Ha! Ha, OK! You're on!

06:04.006 --> 06:05.563
Barefoot.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.848
You're on.

06:16.215 --> 06:19.407
Ha, ha, ha!
Make your bets, boys. Whoo!

06:19.507 --> 06:21.282
Steady. Whoo-hoo!

06:21.382 --> 06:25.392
Bareback. Barefoot-bareback!

06:26.424 --> 06:28.990
Les is gonna ride bareback.
That's a joke.

06:29.090 --> 06:31.907
- You wanna lay money?
- Five bob on Les.

06:32.007 --> 06:34.657
- You cover that, Archy?
- He just said he'd cover it.

06:34.757 --> 06:38.449
- Two to one, right?
- I'm in for five bob.

06:38.550 --> 06:40.658
Don't go on the rocks.

06:40.758 --> 06:43.366
Don't go to the rocks,
go to the mountain.

06:43.466 --> 06:45.283
My money's on Les.

06:45.383 --> 06:49.228
- There's my dough.
- Got a good bet there.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.908
Let's go, boys. You right, Archy?

06:53.008 --> 06:54.491
Line 'em up.

06:54.591 --> 06:56.408
Don't go on the rocks.

06:56.508 --> 06:59.357
On your marks... get set.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.533
Go!

07:16.051 --> 07:18.225
Go, mare!

07:38.926 --> 07:41.100
Ho! Pick it up! Ha!

07:44.968 --> 07:46.265
Come on!

08:34.594 --> 08:37.527
You lose, sonny boy! Enjoy the walk!

08:39.969 --> 08:42.392
Yee-hee! Get up! Ha!

08:57.012 --> 09:00.478
Whoa, Abbie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:01.429 --> 09:03.105
Whoa, boy.

09:16.387 --> 09:20.612
Ha ha! Archy! You win! Archy!

09:22.263 --> 09:24.538
Hooray, Archy! Les fell down!

09:28.305 --> 09:30.288
Archy, Archy, Les...

09:30.388 --> 09:31.871
Zac! What happened?

09:31.971 --> 09:36.812
Les fell down! Les fell down!
Archy, my brother, you win!

09:44.346 --> 09:47.038
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry, Uncle Jack.

09:47.138 --> 09:50.664
You've got the God-given ability
to be amongst our greatest.

09:50.764 --> 09:54.414
You could be up there with Lasalles.

09:54.514 --> 09:56.622
- Uncle Jack...
- Greater than him.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.206
And three days before
your first big race, you do this.

10:00.306 --> 10:02.414
- I'll still win.
- Yeah?

10:02.514 --> 10:04.956
Running's not all there is to life.

10:05.056 --> 10:07.774
Come on, kids, scram. Come on.

10:11.972 --> 10:14.081
Peter Trevelyan joined up last week.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.195
No more of that. You're underage.

10:23.598 --> 10:27.644
- You ran away when you were younger.
- Not to a war.

10:27.765 --> 10:30.540
Been all round the world
by the time you were 18.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.248
- Barbary Coast... Spice Islands.
- I made those stories up.

10:34.348 --> 10:37.623
You didn't. Dad said you were
nearly killed several times.

10:37.723 --> 10:40.998
I judged the risks and took my chances.
War's different.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.730
- How's it...
- It's just different.

10:46.015 --> 10:48.873
There's no hope your parents
would let you go,

10:48.973 --> 10:52.191
so what's the point
in talking about it?

10:52.766 --> 10:55.485
I thought you might help me.

11:05.558 --> 11:08.124
Careful with the plate, darling.

11:08.224 --> 11:10.398
When's this race?

11:11.599 --> 11:12.999
Saturday.

11:13.099 --> 11:16.458
- How long are you going to be gone?
- Just over the weekend.

11:16.558 --> 11:20.958
Fine time to go off in town-right
in the middle of the bloody muster.

11:21.058 --> 11:23.459
Don't swear in front
of the girls, Wallace.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.375
Put in your fair share of work
before you go.

11:26.475 --> 11:28.317
Yes, Dad.

11:30.684 --> 11:34.542
"The fire was burning furiously
at the end of the branch.

11:34.642 --> 11:38.292
"Mowgli struck right and left
and the wolves ran howling

11:38.392 --> 11:40.792
"with the sparks burning their fur.

11:40.892 --> 11:43.917
"At last there were only
Akela, Bagheera,

11:44.017 --> 11:48.241
"and perhaps ten wolves
that had taken Mowgli's part.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.709
"Then something began
to hurt Mowgli inside him

11:52.809 --> 11:55.793
"as he'd never been hurt
in his life before.

11:55.893 --> 11:58.876
"And he caught his breath and sobbed.

11:58.976 --> 12:01.565
"And the tears ran down his face.

12:04.060 --> 12:07.241
"'What is it? What is it? ' he said.

12:08.851 --> 12:13.543
"'I do not wish to leave the jungle,
and I do not know what this is.

12:13.643 --> 12:15.817
"'Am I dying, Bagheera? '

12:16.560 --> 12:19.148
"'No, little brother,' said Bagheera.

12:19.726 --> 12:22.585
"'Those are only tears,
such as men use.

12:22.685 --> 12:27.711
"'Now, I know thou art a man
and a man's cub no longer.

12:27.811 --> 12:30.316
"'Let them fall, Mowgli.

12:30.894 --> 12:33.068
"'They are only tears.'

12:33.769 --> 12:37.752
"So Mowgli sat and cried
as though his heart would break,

12:37.852 --> 12:41.733
"and he'd never cried
in all his life before.

12:42.894 --> 12:45.068
"'Now... ', he said.

12:47.061 --> 12:49.235
"'I will go to men."'

12:51.144 --> 12:53.544
Go on. One more chapter.

12:53.644 --> 12:55.961
Children, come on, inside.

12:56.061 --> 12:58.878
Come on, kids.
Don't get Uncle into trouble.

12:58.978 --> 13:02.878
Bedtime. Come on, inside,
out of the wind.

13:02.978 --> 13:04.920
In to bed.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.443
Hey! Stop that!

14:12.022 --> 14:16.130
"London, 29th April,
the War Office announces...

14:16.230 --> 14:18.755
"'Despite continual opposition,

14:18.855 --> 14:23.339
"'our troops have established
themselves across... Galliple..."'

14:23.439 --> 14:25.162
Gallipoli.

14:34.315 --> 14:36.131
Listen to this.

14:36.231 --> 14:40.756
"The Turkish defences included
wire entanglements on land and sea,

14:40.856 --> 14:43.381
"and deep pits with spiked bottoms."

14:43.481 --> 14:44.659
Bastards!

14:48.398 --> 14:50.215
That's it.

14:50.315 --> 14:52.370
I'm gonna join up.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.614
Me, too.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.965
What about you, Barney?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.590
No.

15:01.690 --> 15:05.716
Oh, be in it.
The girls go wild over a uniform.

15:05.816 --> 15:06.841
Yeah?

15:06.941 --> 15:11.049
In your case, I don't think
anything'd help. But you could try.

15:11.149 --> 15:13.424
Hey, we could all join up together.

15:13.624 --> 15:17.424
Count me in.
Come on, Frank, you gotta be in it.

15:18.965 --> 15:22.007
No thanks, if you blokes
all want to go get yourselves shot,

15:22.107 --> 15:23.216
go ahead.

15:23.316 --> 15:26.424
Well, I'm not scared to die
for my country, Frank.

15:26.524 --> 15:29.091
Good for you, Snowy, sign yourself on.

15:29.191 --> 15:33.466
- Nothing's worse than this.
- Can't argue with that.

15:33.566 --> 15:37.874
- Comin' to join, then?
- No. But I won't stay here either.

15:49.525 --> 15:53.322
Dunne, Lewis, Wilkes!
Where the hell are you?!

16:10.484 --> 16:12.741
There she is!

16:13.151 --> 16:15.718
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?

16:15.818 --> 16:17.593
Don't worry, boss.

16:17.693 --> 16:19.551
You young bastards!

16:19.651 --> 16:22.426
I'll have you shot! Do you hear me?

16:22.526 --> 16:25.541
You'll never work
for the railways again!

16:27.484 --> 16:30.286
It's on top of the cupboard.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.040
Come on, lad.

16:42.652 --> 16:44.135
Coming.

16:44.235 --> 16:46.160
Come on.

16:51.235 --> 16:54.552
- Give us those shoes, little man.
- Bye, Arch.

16:54.652 --> 16:56.135
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

16:56.235 --> 16:58.927
- Goodbye, Mum.
- Hey! It's only two days.

16:59.027 --> 17:01.885
Come on, we've got a race to run.

17:01.985 --> 17:03.957
Children!

17:04.859 --> 17:06.885
Good luck, Son.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.676
Bye, Archy. Come back with a medal.

17:09.777 --> 17:12.545
Goodbye, Archy.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.917
- Bye, kids.
- Bye!

17:20.528 --> 17:22.702
You better win!

17:35.195 --> 17:37.369
It's so beautiful!

17:40.695 --> 17:42.721
Here we go!

17:47.946 --> 17:51.429
- Get out of my car.
- Just having a look, boss.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.160
- Go on, get out.
- Yeah, right-o, right-o.

17:56.987 --> 18:01.887
...these bottled preserves

...very exciting one-mile race.

18:56.156 --> 18:59.764
- What about the handicap?
- I can't talk about that now.

18:59.864 --> 19:03.973
- This where you enter for the Gift?
- Entries closed a week ago.

19:04.073 --> 19:05.681
I've been outback.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.389
- What's your name?
- Dunne.

19:07.489 --> 19:09.348
- You registered?
- In Perth.

19:09.448 --> 19:13.681
- When did you run your last race?
- Fremantle, about... six months ago.

19:13.781 --> 19:16.713
I know you, the stand-up start.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.890
- We got a scratch sheet?
- Give him a go.

19:20.990 --> 19:25.182
- What's the prize money?
- Ten guineas... and the medal.

19:25.282 --> 19:29.541
- Anyone take bets?
- No, it's against the law.

19:31.615 --> 19:34.932
- How much was you wanting to lay?
- Twenty quid.

19:35.032 --> 19:36.932
You're pretty confident.

19:37.032 --> 19:39.206
Where's your twenty?

19:41.115 --> 19:43.765
- Archy Hamilton's running.
- Who's he?

19:43.865 --> 19:46.932
Fastest kid in West Australia,
if not the country.

19:47.032 --> 19:49.475
- What's he run?
- Under ten.

19:49.575 --> 19:52.957
Wouldn't want to take your money
without fair warning.

19:54.908 --> 19:57.248
What's my mark?

19:58.408 --> 20:00.582
Same as the local kid.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.171
All right. You're on.

20:11.616 --> 20:13.641
You can still pull out, lad.

20:13.741 --> 20:18.975
Lasalles pulled out of the Barlow Cup
and nobody thought the worse of him.

20:19.075 --> 20:21.250
Come on.

20:22.992 --> 20:25.249
Push!

20:25.576 --> 20:30.559
Now the big event, the one you've all
been waiting for! The Kimberley Gift!

20:30.659 --> 20:32.833
There you go, boss.

20:33.201 --> 20:35.142
Announcing a late entry.

20:35.242 --> 20:38.184
F.C. Dunne of Perth,
starting off three yards,

20:38.284 --> 20:42.129
the same mark as our own champion,
Archy Hamilton.

20:45.117 --> 20:46.851
Right, start your breathing.

20:46.951 --> 20:48.726
Come on, Archy, boy!

20:48.826 --> 20:51.331
Come on! Deeper, from here!

20:52.368 --> 20:54.791
Now, what are these?

20:55.077 --> 20:57.310
- Come on!
- Steel springs.

20:57.410 --> 20:59.060
- Again!
- Steel springs.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.893
- What will they do?
- Hurl me down the track.

21:01.993 --> 21:04.643
- How fast can you run?
- Fast as a leopard.

21:04.743 --> 21:07.810
- How fast are you going to run?
- As fast as a leopard!

21:07.910 --> 21:11.173
Right! Then let's see you do it.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.685
This is the big one, Simmo!

21:25.828 --> 21:29.091
Beat all those other people!
You can do it!

21:43.453 --> 21:45.627
Runners! Dig in!

21:48.911 --> 21:50.634
Set!

21:56.579 --> 22:00.803
- Come on, champion!
- Go on!

22:44.871 --> 22:48.337
Lads for the Light Horse, over here.

22:49.371 --> 22:53.631
Come on, don't let your mates
over there do all the fighting.

22:55.163 --> 22:57.188
Bring your beer.

22:57.288 --> 23:01.632
If you're fit and you can ride,
get over here and find out how to join.

23:03.914 --> 23:08.689
The Empire needs you. Your country
needs you and your mates need you.

23:08.789 --> 23:12.337
So come and find out how to get into
the greatest game of all.

23:31.998 --> 23:36.756
- That was bad luck, mate.
- Let's just forget it?

23:40.040 --> 23:44.315
Nine and five-sixteenths,
you've equalled the great Harry Lasalles.

23:44.415 --> 23:47.732
- Nothing's going to stop you...
- Jack!

23:47.832 --> 23:49.804
I'm not coming home.

23:55.498 --> 23:57.773
No, I didn't think you were, lad.

23:57.873 --> 24:00.047
Your bag weighed a ton.

24:00.790 --> 24:03.806
- What have you got in it?
- Books, mostly.

24:04.624 --> 24:07.483
What if they don't take you?
You don't look 21.

24:07.583 --> 24:11.131
They won't ask questions
when they see me ride.

24:21.624 --> 24:26.547
We've been through a lot of scrapes
together. Take care of it.

24:28.708 --> 24:32.816
Let's get down there before
those other blokes drink the piss!

24:32.916 --> 24:34.234
Come on, Arch!

24:34.334 --> 24:36.508
I'll write.

24:39.292 --> 24:41.466
God bless you, boy.

24:49.167 --> 24:52.025
- Twenty-one?
- Yes, sir.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.067
You don't look it.
Got a birth certificate?

24:55.167 --> 24:58.150
I didn't know we were supposed
to bring one, sir.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.234
Go on, mount up.

24:59.334 --> 25:01.150
Excuse me, sir.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.735
I know this lad and he's only eighteen.

25:04.835 --> 25:07.693
His father would skin him
if he knew he was here.

25:07.793 --> 25:13.226
We can turn a blind eye if it's just
six months, but not at 18. Come on.

25:15.168 --> 25:18.776
Come back here! Come back!
Don't be such a bloody fool!

25:18.876 --> 25:20.818
Hey, hey, pull him off!

25:20.918 --> 25:25.068
- You show 'em, mate!
- You little beauty!

25:25.168 --> 25:28.716
- Go, young Archy!
- Good on you, Arch!

25:40.192 --> 25:41.859
Morning.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.510
Three and six?

25:50.252 --> 25:53.486
- "After months of hard training..."
- "Training"!

25:53.586 --> 25:55.760
"...Australia's fighting..."

25:56.127 --> 25:58.763
- G'day.
- G'day.

25:59.294 --> 26:02.777
"...Australia's fighting force
faced it's baptism of fire

26:02.877 --> 26:07.551
"on the rocky slopes of... Gallipoli,
and proved themselves heroes."

26:24.753 --> 26:29.310
Sorry about yesterday, mate.
You run a great race. Frank Dunne.

26:30.003 --> 26:31.403
Archy Hamilton.

26:31.503 --> 26:35.487
It gave me a hell of a shock
to be beaten out here.

26:35.587 --> 26:38.153
I won everything
there was to win in Perth.

26:38.253 --> 26:39.278
I was just lucky.

26:39.378 --> 26:44.029
Anyone who runs under nine and a half
with crook feet isn't just lucky.

26:44.129 --> 26:47.988
- You joinin' up?
- No, I missed out. I'm underage.

26:48.088 --> 26:50.571
You want something to eat?

26:50.671 --> 26:52.738
You mean, would I like to order.

26:52.838 --> 26:55.696
- Are you from the city?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

26:55.796 --> 26:58.196
Well, we don't put on the dog here.

26:58.296 --> 27:01.613
- What do you want?
- If that's your attitude, nothing.

27:01.713 --> 27:05.758
- Suit yourself.
- He's not finished. Are you, mate?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.489
Thank you.

27:11.589 --> 27:15.386
- You better have something.
- I'm not hungry.

27:17.964 --> 27:19.989
- Don't you want it?
- No.

27:20.089 --> 27:22.891
Well, I can't see good food wasted.

27:25.422 --> 27:27.239
Gonna try again?

27:27.339 --> 27:29.739
I can't. They know I'm underage.

27:29.839 --> 27:31.976
Not here, in Perth.

27:43.340 --> 27:45.311
Now!

28:00.715 --> 28:02.687
You bastard!

28:06.173 --> 28:09.888
Come on! Come on!

28:14.341 --> 28:15.741
Whoo!

28:15.841 --> 28:19.407
- Nearly lost me, mate.
- You sure it's headed for Perth?

28:19.507 --> 28:23.553
Course it bloody is.
Nowhere else for it to go.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.602
Hey! Come on, mate, we're here.

29:02.925 --> 29:05.099
Perth?

29:05.425 --> 29:08.440
Er... No, mate, not quite.

29:12.842 --> 29:14.399
Morning.

29:14.675 --> 29:17.264
We seem to have... lost our train.

29:22.384 --> 29:25.518
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks! Bugger it!

29:27.384 --> 29:31.016
Unless you're game enough
to cross the lake.

29:35.134 --> 29:38.730
Hey, Arch, two weeks,
that's not too long...

29:40.593 --> 29:43.618
- Hey, Arch, hang on!
- Better take this.

29:43.718 --> 29:47.515
Hey, Archy, will ya... Arch!

29:48.384 --> 29:53.119
Archy, we'll fry like eggs out there.
Let's give this a little thought, eh?

29:53.219 --> 29:55.393
You'll never make it!

29:56.135 --> 29:59.285
- Archy, wait!
- There's fifty mile o' that!

29:59.385 --> 30:00.943
Oi!

30:01.510 --> 30:05.189
If the snakes don't get you,
the black fellas will!

30:09.260 --> 30:10.983
Wait!

30:12.760 --> 30:14.785
You're mad. We should have waited.

30:14.885 --> 30:16.910
It's quicker this way.

30:17.010 --> 30:20.025
That's what Burke and Wills thought!

30:22.136 --> 30:24.745
How do you know
we're not going in circles?

30:24.845 --> 30:27.019
The sun.

30:27.803 --> 30:31.161
- What if we run out of water?
- We find it.

30:31.261 --> 30:33.995
- How do you find it?
- Cockatoos.

30:34.095 --> 30:36.861
Sunset, they lead you straight to it.

30:37.470 --> 30:42.357
Oh, that's lovely! We put our lives
in the hands of a mob of parrots.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.664
What's all this watch business?

31:57.764 --> 32:00.498
When you point twelve o'clock
to the sun,

32:00.598 --> 32:04.063
north is halfway
between the hour hand and twelve.

32:06.181 --> 32:09.039
- Can you ride, Frank?
- Yeah, why?

32:09.139 --> 32:12.581
Just wondered why
you didn't try for the Light Horse.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.164
Didn't want to.

32:14.264 --> 32:17.248
- What then, infantry?
- I'm not joining anything.

32:17.348 --> 32:21.373
- But you gotta be in it!
- Not if you don't want to.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.647
You gotta be.

32:24.348 --> 32:28.312
No, I don't. It's a free country,
or haven't you heard?

32:29.599 --> 32:31.999
I'd be ashamed if I didn't fight.

32:32.099 --> 32:35.499
That only proves one thing...
that you and I are different.

32:35.599 --> 32:37.985
Let's drop it, eh?

32:40.682 --> 32:43.040
You of all people should be going.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.165
Why me of all people?

32:45.265 --> 32:47.249
Cos you're an athlete.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.832
What's that got to do with it?

32:49.932 --> 32:53.124
I've mates who'd be lucky
to run the hundred in twelve

32:53.224 --> 32:56.082
and they're going,
so why shouldn't you?

32:56.182 --> 32:58.415
Because it's not our bloody war!

32:58.515 --> 33:00.708
What do you mean, not our war?

33:00.808 --> 33:03.916
It's an English war,
it's nothing to do with us.

33:04.016 --> 33:08.027
You know what you are,
you're a bloody coward.

33:09.808 --> 33:13.708
There's only one reason
I haven't knocked you down, mate.

33:13.808 --> 33:14.938
What?

33:17.350 --> 33:20.083
Cos I don't feel like carrying you.

33:20.183 --> 33:24.526
Now shut up and don't open
your yap about the war again!

34:17.685 --> 34:19.859
Where's your sun now?

35:27.354 --> 35:29.195
Frank!

35:55.105 --> 35:56.235
Stop!

35:56.730 --> 35:58.702
Hey!

36:04.605 --> 36:06.577
Hey!

36:06.896 --> 36:09.071
Stop!

36:15.897 --> 36:19.529
This would have to be your lucky day.

36:22.064 --> 36:24.756
We were told there's a property
due south.

36:24.856 --> 36:27.756
Old Dan's place.
You got about ten more miles.

36:27.856 --> 36:29.881
He'd give you a ride to Wallaby.

36:29.981 --> 36:32.214
- Where you headed?
- Perth.

36:32.314 --> 36:37.006
I nearly went there once. Thought I should
see one big city before I die.

36:37.106 --> 36:38.589
You looking for work?

36:38.689 --> 36:41.715
- No, I'm off to the war.
- What war?

36:41.815 --> 36:43.989
The war against Germany.

36:44.773 --> 36:46.994
I knew a German once.

36:48.190 --> 36:51.340
- How did it start?
- Don't start him.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.715
Don't know exactly,
but it was the Germans' fault.

36:54.815 --> 36:57.965
- The Australians fighting already?
- Yeah, in Turkey.

36:58.065 --> 37:00.757
Turkey?! Why's that?

37:00.857 --> 37:04.090
- Ask him.
- Cos Turkey's a German ally.

37:04.190 --> 37:07.407
Well, you learn something every day.

37:08.648 --> 37:11.549
Still, can't see
what it's got to do with us.

37:11.649 --> 37:14.913
We don't stop them there,
they could end up here.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.740
And they're welcome to it.

37:29.774 --> 37:32.161
We made it, you bastard!

37:42.274 --> 37:43.702
Whoo!

38:09.484 --> 38:11.967
- G'day.
- G'day.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.991
Don't wear out the leather
on them boots, will ya?

38:32.568 --> 38:35.385
The truth is there was no choice.

38:35.485 --> 38:36.593
Mary.

38:36.693 --> 38:40.135
You're very brave
to set off without a compass.

38:40.235 --> 38:45.834
Not really. With a watch and the sun
you can find your way anywhere.

38:47.986 --> 38:50.344
Why are you boys going to Perth?

38:50.444 --> 38:53.661
- I'm going to join the Light Horse.
- Good.

38:53.819 --> 38:55.511
You too, Frank?

38:55.611 --> 38:58.386
No, business interests to attend to.

38:58.486 --> 39:02.844
While the Germans are crucifying kittens
on church doors in Belgium.

39:02.944 --> 39:06.011
- Yes, yes...
- I love their uniforms.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.302
Most of the boys around here joined.

39:08.402 --> 39:11.177
If I'd had a son, he'd have joined too.

39:11.277 --> 39:15.011
Let's drink a toast to our brave
young friend. The Light Horse.

39:15.111 --> 39:16.677
The Light Horse.

39:16.777 --> 39:21.831
- The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.

39:36.862 --> 39:39.762
What did you mean
about business interests?

39:39.862 --> 39:42.595
Business interests, you know, finance.

39:42.695 --> 39:47.553
- You told me you were broke.
- Hell, I am, thanks to you.

39:47.653 --> 39:51.096
What would you have done
with the money if you'd won?

39:51.196 --> 39:53.582
I was gonna start a bike shop.

39:59.779 --> 40:03.263
They only take toffs
and farmers' sons in the Light Horse?

40:03.363 --> 40:05.304
You thinking of joining?

40:05.404 --> 40:08.513
Well, there's no way
you'd get me near the infantry.

40:08.613 --> 40:11.638
But the Light Horse,
now that's got a bit of class.

40:11.738 --> 40:14.291
Whoo-hoo!
We could join together.

40:16.029 --> 40:18.054
There's only one problem, mate.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.221
What?

40:19.321 --> 40:22.089
You know I told you I could ride...

40:23.530 --> 40:25.704
Come here.

40:26.239 --> 40:29.918
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in his shoulder, up.

40:30.030 --> 40:31.680
Knee in his shoulder.

40:31.780 --> 40:35.097
No, no. Foot in the stirrup first.
Swing up.

40:35.197 --> 40:36.930
Swing up.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.264
Bloody thing won't stand still.

40:39.364 --> 40:40.861
Get on him!

41:29.782 --> 41:31.956
What name?

41:32.366 --> 41:34.391
What do you mean?

41:34.491 --> 41:38.750
What do you want to call yourself?
Can't use your own name.

41:41.949 --> 41:44.123
Lasalles.

41:45.991 --> 41:49.042
Archibald... Lasalles.

42:00.950 --> 42:05.624
By the time I'm finished with you,
you'll look the other side of 40.

42:10.033 --> 42:13.914
Where Mother Nature fails...
Frank Dunne succeeds.

42:15.617 --> 42:16.767
Oh, no!

42:16.867 --> 42:19.253
- Hang on.
- No, Frank.

42:19.783 --> 42:21.183
It looks good.

42:21.283 --> 42:24.298
- Oh, no... look...
- Hang on.

42:24.742 --> 42:27.267
- A little glue, some hair.
- Oh, no.

42:27.367 --> 42:30.715
- I've done it before, pal.
- Bugger off, Frank.

42:31.909 --> 42:33.934
Have another drink.

42:34.034 --> 42:38.726
- Whisky doesn't make you look old.
- Doesn't it? Have you seen my dad?

42:38.826 --> 42:42.872
I know he looks like a wreck,
but he's really only 35.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.167
Jesus.

42:47.993 --> 42:49.559
How's he look, Dad?

42:49.659 --> 42:53.809
Fine. But what the hell
do you want to join up for?

42:53.909 --> 42:58.309
The English killed your grandfather.
Hung him with his own belt...

42:58.409 --> 43:00.810
five miles from Dublin.

43:00.910 --> 43:03.727
I'm not going to fight
for the British Empire.

43:03.827 --> 43:05.852
I'm gonna keep my head down.

43:05.952 --> 43:10.176
Learn a trick or two, and...
come back an officer.

43:11.327 --> 43:13.299
Maybe.

43:13.494 --> 43:16.019
I don't want to be
pushed around forever.

43:16.119 --> 43:17.462
Right.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.004
Right.

43:35.245 --> 43:37.134
Lasalles!

43:37.536 --> 43:39.177
Lasalles!

43:45.953 --> 43:48.061
Lasalles?

43:48.161 --> 43:51.278
Any relation to Harry Lasalles,
the famous runner?

43:51.378 --> 43:53.135
No, sir.

43:57.786 --> 44:00.228
All right, Lasalles, up to the dock.

44:00.328 --> 44:02.503
Thank you, sir.

44:05.954 --> 44:07.979
- Dunne.
- Sir.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.771
Any military experience?

44:09.871 --> 44:12.354
Five years
in the Melbourne Horse Cadets.

44:12.454 --> 44:14.437
Never heard of them.

44:14.537 --> 44:18.133
They never received as much
recognition as they deserved.

44:22.621 --> 44:24.178
Thank you, sir.

44:28.579 --> 44:31.594
Come on, move it along.

44:32.121 --> 44:34.792
Present arms!

44:35.705 --> 44:38.980
OK, Lasalles, you're in.
Report to that group.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.605
Dunne, mount up.

44:40.705 --> 44:43.980
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in his shoulder and relax.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.254
Thanks, mate.

44:47.038 --> 44:50.272
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in the shoulder...

44:50.372 --> 44:51.730
Thank you.

44:51.830 --> 44:56.671
G'day, pal. I'm your uncle Frank.
Tough but fair, so no nonsense?

45:03.997 --> 45:06.764
Hurry up, Dunne,
or the war will be over.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.481
Ha!

45:10.581 --> 45:12.755
Kick him!

45:23.039 --> 45:25.213
Kick him!

45:28.039 --> 45:30.213
Give him a rocking horse!

45:31.498 --> 45:34.300
All right, Dunne.
Thank you very much.

45:52.332 --> 45:54.607
All right, pick up your bags, fellas.

45:54.707 --> 45:57.591
Right turn! Quick march!

46:08.916 --> 46:12.483
Right! All you blokes
from the Tenth Reinforcements

46:12.583 --> 46:15.930
know you're not supposed
to be in here-out now!

46:17.000 --> 46:19.588
That means you too, Lasalles.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.380
- See you when I see you.
- Yeah.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.925
Not if I see you first.

46:51.209 --> 46:55.255
- See you later, mate.
- All the best, Bill.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.975
I wish I was goin' with you.

47:53.211 --> 47:55.385
Look after yourself!

47:57.961 --> 48:02.304
Four pairs of socks, plenty of singlets
and Eno's for your stomach.

48:03.253 --> 48:04.653
And this...

48:04.753 --> 48:07.306
to drink on our anniversary.

48:09.003 --> 48:11.223
Please come home.

49:35.006 --> 49:37.614
Now, come on, Jim, you're not stupid!

49:37.714 --> 49:41.239
That was three years ago!
We're in the middle of a drought!

49:41.339 --> 49:43.864
That's my whole point, you stupid galah!

49:51.965 --> 49:55.448
- What are you blokes doing here?
- It's our last night.

49:55.548 --> 49:58.990
If you're not going to fight,
at least buy us a beer.

49:59.090 --> 50:00.303
Make it four, Perce!

50:12.798 --> 50:15.600
I've got me horse outside, mate.

50:22.591 --> 50:24.148
Next!

50:27.508 --> 50:28.491
Arms up.

50:28.591 --> 50:30.158
- Hat off!
- Sorry.

50:30.258 --> 50:34.199
Come on, another quarter of an inch.
Come on, come on.

50:34.299 --> 50:36.616
Teeth aren't all that good.

50:36.716 --> 50:39.533
You're supposed to shoot the enemy,
not bite him.

50:39.633 --> 50:42.647
We don't take anyone with bad teeth.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.972
If you don't pass him,
you've lost all four of us.

50:48.841 --> 50:51.015
Over there.

50:51.133 --> 50:53.105
Next.

50:56.384 --> 50:57.941
Open.

51:08.967 --> 51:11.104
Atten-tion!

51:40.218 --> 51:44.264
Something's gotta be done
about that lofty bastard.

51:44.593 --> 51:48.734
- Crikey, they're big.
- Yeah, so's that bloody Victorian.

51:49.218 --> 51:51.618
Hello, Australia, welcome.
Antiques...

51:51.718 --> 51:52.701
No, no, no.

51:52.801 --> 51:56.285
I reckon it took 100,000 blokes
20 years to build that.

51:56.385 --> 51:59.661
Must've been a lot of blokes around
with crook backs.

51:59.761 --> 52:04.786
- It's not just a monument, you know.
- It's a bloody great pile of rubble.

52:04.886 --> 52:06.744
The Pharaoh, mate...

52:06.844 --> 52:10.327
his wife and everything
they had were buried in there.

52:10.427 --> 52:14.568
Yeah... That's man's first attempt
to beat death.

52:18.886 --> 52:22.077
Thanks, professor, can you get
your mind back on the game?

52:22.177 --> 52:25.369
Let's think about
the West Australians' first attempt

52:25.469 --> 52:27.643
to beat the bloody Vics.

52:27.802 --> 52:32.561
Something's gotta be done about
that long, thin streak of pelican shit.

52:36.303 --> 52:40.267
Yeah, get him, Bill.
Sort the bastard right out.

53:07.138 --> 53:13.151
All right, men. You are shortly to be
let loose on the local inhabitants...

53:13.763 --> 53:18.022
who, you will be surprised to find,
don't look at all like you.

53:18.679 --> 53:22.524
A fact of which they are,
no doubt, eternally grateful.

53:23.429 --> 53:27.079
First up, beware of the local eggs,

53:27.179 --> 53:30.413
which can be distinguished
only by their antiquity,

53:30.513 --> 53:33.481
the local liquor, which is poisonous,

53:34.472 --> 53:39.205
and for those of you contemplating
some horizontal refreshment...

53:41.014 --> 53:43.188
Just be warned.

53:43.597 --> 53:47.205
Because those proverbial
few moments of pleasure...

53:47.305 --> 53:53.402
are very likely to leave you
with a legacy which is horribly painful...

53:53.972 --> 53:56.872
difficult to cure
and may get you sent home

53:56.972 --> 54:02.497
to face embarrassing questions
from girlfriend and or... wife.

54:02.597 --> 54:07.248
However, I know nothing I say
is going to discourage some of you,

54:07.348 --> 54:10.665
so I'm going to hand you over
to Doc Morgan

54:10.765 --> 54:13.248
who has had it all and cured it all.

54:14.473 --> 54:18.732
He will show you how to minimise
the risk, so pay attention.

54:19.431 --> 54:22.020
Company... atten-tion!

54:25.140 --> 54:26.123
Quiet!

54:39.932 --> 54:43.777
Hey! Hey, come back here, gippo!
Come back here!

55:04.099 --> 55:06.417
Hey, how much for one mule? How much?

55:09.558 --> 55:13.833
- Hang on, how much is he charging?
- Five, that's what he wants.

55:13.933 --> 55:15.250
- Nah.
- Four, four.

55:15.350 --> 55:18.792
- Nah, the official price is two.
- No, no, five piasters.

55:18.892 --> 55:21.417
- Two.
- Give him a bit more.

55:21.517 --> 55:25.657
There is a correct price-we pay more,
we encourage dishonesty.

55:26.475 --> 55:31.197
Yah, or we could
join Dickie and the chaps at seven.

55:34.183 --> 55:37.042
Do you mind shifting those animals
out of the way?

55:37.142 --> 55:39.115
Sorry, sir.

55:52.101 --> 55:54.876
Hey, those four there.
Ten piasters. OK.

55:54.976 --> 55:59.084
- The correct price is two piasters.
- It'll be worth it, Snow!

55:59.184 --> 56:02.614
Are you going
to the Governor General's ball?

56:04.601 --> 56:08.398
I say, Carruthers, there's Dickie
and the chaps up there.

56:09.769 --> 56:12.571
I say, good morning, chaps!
How are we?

56:13.185 --> 56:15.294
Tally-ho! After the fox.

56:15.394 --> 56:19.752
You Australians are crude
and the most ill-mannered soldiers ever.

56:19.852 --> 56:21.877
Wait till you see the New Zealanders!

56:21.977 --> 56:23.252

Now, how can they do that, Frank?

57:46.230 --> 57:50.463
Life is cheap here, Snow, and the women
have no respect for themselves.

57:50.563 --> 57:53.047
It's the same in most foreign places.

57:53.147 --> 57:54.797
Barney!

57:59.730 --> 58:01.713
Insolent!

58:05.105 --> 58:07.693
Have a look at this, fellas.

58:07.855 --> 58:10.325
Over a thousand years old.

58:10.855 --> 58:15.946
- How much did you pay for it?
- I beat him down to two quid.

58:19.689 --> 58:21.839
Bastard! How much did you pay?

58:21.939 --> 58:24.113
Five bob.

58:25.439 --> 58:29.673
See, what did I tell you?
These gippoes are a pack of thieves.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.947
Me take picture.

58:37.064 --> 58:39.238
That one, I think.

58:41.856 --> 58:43.828
Ready?

58:45.023 --> 58:46.995
Let's go.

58:56.315 --> 58:57.882
Oi!

59:01.065 --> 59:03.882
- Shalom, shalom.
- What can I do for you, gentlemen?

59:03.982 --> 59:07.049
We Australians
come to your country as guests.

59:07.149 --> 59:09.674
You are an old civilisation,
we are a new...

59:09.774 --> 59:14.215
Bill, don't give him the geography lesson,
tell him to cough up.

59:14.315 --> 59:18.340
Listen, we are not just soldiers,
we are diplomats for our country.

59:18.440 --> 59:21.008
Give my mate his money
or I'll flatten you.

59:21.108 --> 59:23.966
- No.
- But Frank, they're bloody thieves.

59:24.066 --> 59:26.675
They've got a different way
of seeing things.

59:26.775 --> 59:30.591
You see, our problem is
I bought this from another shop

59:30.691 --> 59:33.050
and paid five shillings for it.

59:33.150 --> 59:37.216
Whereas my friend, Mr Wilson,
bought this... from you...

59:37.316 --> 59:42.369
which you can see is exactly
the same-and paid two pound,

59:42.816 --> 59:46.300
which in my country
would seem to be pretty unfair.

59:46.400 --> 59:47.550
Too right.

59:47.650 --> 59:51.051
So, we were wondering
if you wouldn't mind taking it back

59:51.151 --> 59:53.426
and giving us the two pound.

59:53.526 --> 59:57.051
No, no, no, this is not mine.
This is yours.

59:57.151 --> 59:59.384
If you tried that where we come from,

59:59.484 --> 01:00:03.791
you'd last about as long as
a snowflake in summer, now cough up.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:08.009
- This is not mine!
- I'm gonna get really angry here.

01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:10.884
Snow! Now listen, mate.

01:00:10.984 --> 01:00:12.801
I know how you feel.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.075
But while a sale is a sale...

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:20.290
- Now, what I was saying...
- Careful, Frank!

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.534
OK, OK, OK!

01:00:25.235 --> 01:00:27.409
Take your money and go!

01:00:28.235 --> 01:00:31.368
You're dealing with Australians here.

01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:42.927
Hey, fellas...

01:00:43.027 --> 01:00:45.302
That wasn't the shop.
This is it, here.

01:00:45.402 --> 01:00:48.583
Hey, fellas,
it was the wrong shop. Hey!

01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:01.077
Hey, fellas, this way!

01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:15.124
We clean, no dirty, we very clean.

01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:25.244
Come on, come on.

01:01:37.529 --> 01:01:41.574
Hello, honey bunny,
you want to come with me?

01:01:44.529 --> 01:01:45.887
Nah.

01:01:45.987 --> 01:01:49.666
I don't believe it. Frank, Frank.

01:01:52.487 --> 01:01:54.661
I don't believe...

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.786
Sink your bo peepers on that.

01:01:59.113 --> 01:02:01.287
I...

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:06.096
I wonder if it'd be too much trouble
to ask... how much?

01:02:06.196 --> 01:02:07.555
Twenty piasters.

01:02:07.655 --> 01:02:11.305
- Cripes, that's only four bob!
- Barney, cut it out!

01:02:11.405 --> 01:02:15.263
Snow, this is wartime and...
in a month we might be dead.

01:02:15.363 --> 01:02:18.875
Billy, they're common, they're cheap.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.930
- Relatively.
- Beats antiques, I'm game.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.846
Wait here, Snow,
we'll be back in a few minutes.

01:02:24.946 --> 01:02:28.495
Don't give 'em a penny
till it's all over.

01:02:29.406 --> 01:02:32.373
You know what? I'm disgusted.

01:02:33.156 --> 01:02:36.764
What are you going to say
to your wives on your wedding night?

01:02:36.864 --> 01:02:41.097
Calm down, you don't win
a medal for finishing third.

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:43.722
Hello, my friend.
Welcome, Australia.

01:02:43.822 --> 01:02:45.764
Bugger off.

01:02:52.572 --> 01:02:56.369
Hello, Australia!
Hello, hello! Hello, Australia.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:02.711
Welcome to my country.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:07.015
You buy from me, my name is Yosef.

01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:09.289
Company! Halt!

01:03:09.907 --> 01:03:11.932
Rest easy.

01:03:13.698 --> 01:03:15.848
Put that canteen away, that man!

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:18.122
You buy?

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.745
All right, let's have some quiet.

01:03:24.407 --> 01:03:26.581
As you all know...

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:33.921
this morning's exercise involves
a frontal assault on an enemy trench,

01:03:35.658 --> 01:03:39.917
the enemy being some gentlemen
from the Light Horse.

01:03:41.033 --> 01:03:43.058
Now, these gentlemen,

01:03:43.158 --> 01:03:47.832
presumably because their arses
are higher from the ground than ours...

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:53.683
tend to assume airs of superiority.

01:03:55.574 --> 01:03:58.933
But they won't have their horses
with them today.

01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:03.183
So I want you to go out there
this morning,

01:04:03.284 --> 01:04:05.642
and short of actually killing them...

01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:09.290
show them the stuff
the infantry is made of!

01:04:28.867 --> 01:04:30.839
Load!

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:35.750
Keep calm and keep steady.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:46.000
Aim high!

01:04:46.868 --> 01:04:48.626
Fire at will!

01:04:49.243 --> 01:04:51.215
Fire!

01:05:10.952 --> 01:05:13.256
Yosef! Me, Yosef!

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.686
Hello! Hello!

01:05:54.912 --> 01:05:57.770
- How are you, Frank?
- You bugger!

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.770
- What do you men think you're doing?
- We're mates, sir.

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:05.544
- This is supposed to be warfare.
- Break this up over here.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.961
Jolly enthusiastic.

01:06:25.663 --> 01:06:28.251
Someone's taken my bloody oranges!

01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:36.604
Right, survivors, dress the wounded
and carry them back to the A-post.

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:44.253
Lie down, Arch, come on.

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:49.230
Well, you can't all be bloody wounded!

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:53.755
Those of you not designated
to be dead, on your feet now!

01:06:57.789 --> 01:07:01.834
Beat it, mate, we're dead.
We're dead, mate, piss off!

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:05.922
- Three!
- Five piasters.

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:13.940
See you there. Tuesday at seven.
Don't forget!

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.214
Bye, boys.

01:07:17.956 --> 01:07:19.356
Bye!

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:22.023
Hey, you know what your problem is?

01:07:22.123 --> 01:07:25.190
- What?
- The way you start.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:27.273
You're wrong, Arch.

01:07:27.373 --> 01:07:31.273
No, crouching makes all the difference.
Lasalles proved that.

01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:35.273
You're wrong. If you crouch down,
you've got further to go to get up.

01:07:35.373 --> 01:07:37.398
Try it.

01:07:37.498 --> 01:07:39.672
First to the pyramids.

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:42.845
OK, you're on.

01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:44.844
Ready?

01:07:45.457 --> 01:07:46.649
Set.

01:07:46.749 --> 01:07:48.010
Go!

01:08:29.457 --> 01:08:31.631
We... We're both...

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:35.381
We're both mad!

01:09:20.002 --> 01:09:21.194
Whoo-ee!

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:31.184
No.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:33.609
Maybe if you were brothers.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.277
- But, sir, we...
- I said no.

01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:42.551
Sir, we're not taking our horses,
so he wouldn't have to ride at all.

01:09:44.335 --> 01:09:48.652
Now, look. Your own blokes
are going across very soon.

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:50.819
Why do you want a transfer, Dunne?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.403
We're mates, sir.

01:09:52.502 --> 01:09:55.518
- That's not good enough.
- We train together, sir.

01:09:56.586 --> 01:09:58.528
- You runners?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.361
- Sprinters?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:00.461 --> 01:10:04.111
- What's your best time for the 100?
- We both run under ten.

01:10:04.211 --> 01:10:08.684
That's a coincidence.
Young Lasalles runs under ten.

01:10:12.628 --> 01:10:16.638
Well, a fast pair of legs
is never a drawback in any troop.

01:10:17.545 --> 01:10:20.477
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.

01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:34.345
Buy antique.

01:10:37.754 --> 01:10:39.654
Antique?

01:10:39.754 --> 01:10:42.769
- Antique?
- No, no.

01:10:45.129 --> 01:10:46.971
Billy.

01:10:47.587 --> 01:10:49.761
Morning, ladies.

01:10:52.462 --> 01:10:54.637
Ha, ha!

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.894
What do you think?

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:04.721
It's all right.

01:11:07.922 --> 01:11:11.352
- What's the matter with you blokes?
- Nothing.

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:14.155
Look, I always wanted
to join the Light Horse.

01:11:14.255 --> 01:11:16.843
Infantry not good enough
for you... mate?

01:11:21.463 --> 01:11:26.021
Well, if that's how you're gonna be,
I'll see you when I see you.

01:11:33.214 --> 01:11:34.558
Morning, ladies.

01:11:36.048 --> 01:11:39.739
Come off the boil, Snow.
You know Frank.

01:11:39.839 --> 01:11:43.448
Sell his grandmother for tuppence...
still talk his way to heaven.

01:11:43.548 --> 01:11:47.593
Aw, it's just bad luck
for mates to split up.

01:12:01.965 --> 01:12:04.615
Monsieur Picard.
Telegram, Monsieur Picard.

01:12:04.715 --> 01:12:06.782
Oui, par ici!

01:12:06.882 --> 01:12:09.649
- Monsieur Picard?
- Oui. Merci.

01:12:15.132 --> 01:12:17.436
Message for Major Barton.

01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:21.865
Thank you, sir.

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:28.782
Message for Major Barton.

01:12:28.882 --> 01:12:31.139
Can you see him? Thank you, sir.

01:12:32.675 --> 01:12:34.700
He's just over there.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.658
- Where?
- Just over there.

01:12:36.758 --> 01:12:40.603
Run over and give it to him yourself.
Good evening, sir.

01:13:06.217 --> 01:13:09.034
Message for Major Hamilton.
I see him.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:11.557
Hey, you... Evening, sir.

01:13:18.467 --> 01:13:24.018
Would you mind telling Dunne
that this is a dance for officers only?

01:13:32.593 --> 01:13:34.483
Lasalles.

01:13:35.593 --> 01:13:38.285
Have one or two drinks before you go.

01:13:38.385 --> 01:13:40.143
Sir.

01:13:47.968 --> 01:13:50.023
Cheers.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:45.833
Over there!

01:16:45.933 --> 01:16:48.999
'...north of bay 700. Douse it.'

01:16:49.099 --> 01:16:50.458
All right, douse it!

01:16:50.558 --> 01:16:52.198
Douse it.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.584
Come on, mate, you'll be all right.

01:17:51.268 --> 01:17:53.856
No smoking, no talking, pass it on.

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:15.282
G'day.

01:18:16.727 --> 01:18:19.336
The thing I can't stand
about you, mate,

01:18:19.436 --> 01:18:22.294
is you're always so bloody cheerful.

01:18:22.394 --> 01:18:25.611
Hey, have you got any firewood?

01:18:29.602 --> 01:18:31.627
Don't they ever let up?

01:18:31.727 --> 01:18:35.419
...O'Reilly and Duggan, get over here!

01:18:35.519 --> 01:18:37.044
What's for breakfast?

01:18:37.144 --> 01:18:39.961
Brown biscuit porridge
and fried bully beef.

01:18:40.061 --> 01:18:42.961
If you'd got the bacon
like you promised.

01:18:43.061 --> 01:18:45.252
I can't work miracles.

01:18:45.352 --> 01:18:47.961
You were saying there's bacon around.

01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:51.741
There is. You just gotta
give me time to learn the ropes.

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:57.420
Winner take all.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.545
- What do you mean?
- Insurance.

01:18:59.645 --> 01:19:02.412
Covers everything except sharks.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.370
- Here she comes, look out!
- Down, boys!

01:19:57.522 --> 01:19:59.908
My arm! I'm hit.

01:20:08.355 --> 01:20:10.797
- Payment in full.
- Good on you.

01:20:10.897 --> 01:20:14.130
Now you're flush,
you couldn't lend me five bob?

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:16.130
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

01:20:22.105 --> 01:20:24.090
You got a match?

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:26.743
Eleven o'clock. Go!

01:20:28.231 --> 01:20:30.405
Did you get him?

01:20:32.815 --> 01:20:34.952
Have a look for yourself.

01:20:37.815 --> 01:20:41.743
Hello, Australia!
Good good. Come closer.

01:20:44.981 --> 01:20:47.155
New blokes, are you?

01:20:48.856 --> 01:20:51.590
- Here you go.
- No, thanks.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:53.881
We were all right when we landed,

01:20:53.981 --> 01:20:57.132
but the Turks have had us
pinned down here ever since.

01:20:57.232 --> 01:21:00.507
You blokes have been brought over
for a big push.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:02.882
Good, I haven't seen a Turk yet.

01:21:02.982 --> 01:21:04.507
I'm in no hurry.

01:21:04.607 --> 01:21:06.781
Dead set, mate, I tell you.

01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:10.549
Water bottles!
Water bottles! Bottles!

01:21:10.649 --> 01:21:12.823
Give us a smile.

01:21:16.066 --> 01:21:17.824
Morning, Abdul!

01:21:21.232 --> 01:21:22.424
Bottles.

01:21:22.524 --> 01:21:24.382
Hey, mate, hey! Got a smoke?

01:21:24.482 --> 01:21:26.132
Yeah.

01:21:26.233 --> 01:21:28.407
Keep your head down!

01:21:29.608 --> 01:21:31.675
Here, have two. Got any bacon?

01:21:31.775 --> 01:21:34.577
Yeah, but we're a bit short
on champagne.

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:37.925
Good on you, mate.

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.659
Pleased to meet you.

01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:52.238
- Yeah, it is shorter.
- Yeah.

01:21:52.567 --> 01:21:55.300
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.676
It's a short cut to the beach, isn't it?

01:21:58.776 --> 01:22:01.744
Short cut to the bloody cemetery.

01:22:06.609 --> 01:22:09.198
There you go. What do you reckon?

01:22:10.443 --> 01:22:12.718
- Thanks, mate.
- Yeah, right-o, pal.

01:22:12.818 --> 01:22:14.114
Keep down.

01:22:17.859 --> 01:22:20.246
Righty-ho, all the way.

01:22:24.651 --> 01:22:27.240
We need some more supplies over here.

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:32.344
Come on, don't dawdle!

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:39.326
You gotta be joking.

01:22:39.777 --> 01:22:41.951
You two mongrels!

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.034
Strewth!

01:22:52.985 --> 01:22:55.787
Sneddy, give us a hand with this, mate?

01:22:59.569 --> 01:23:01.761
He doesn't look too fierce to me.

01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:04.303
He's the midget of the family.

01:23:04.403 --> 01:23:06.992
Get an eyeful of that.

01:23:09.028 --> 01:23:11.202
Crikey!

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:14.761
- Here, take 'em.
- Sorry, mate, no sale.

01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:17.345
- I'll throw that in.
- Sorry, no deal.

01:23:17.445 --> 01:23:21.345
- What's it worth to you, mate?
- The bacon and the flask.

01:23:21.445 --> 01:23:25.636
- Bit rough.
- Take it or leave it, I've gotta go.

01:23:25.736 --> 01:23:27.910
Yeah, I suppose.

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:41.330
...that means you, Private Wilson!

01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:45.262
Straight out of the boats!

01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:47.536
Hey, Barn!

01:23:49.279 --> 01:23:51.453
Bill? Snowy!

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:56.679
We're bound to lose for sure now!

01:23:58.529 --> 01:24:00.637
You pack of bastards!

01:24:00.737 --> 01:24:04.180
- Good to see you, mate!
- We're all together again!

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:08.847
Hey, Arch! Come here, mate,
I've got some blokes for you to meet!

01:24:08.947 --> 01:24:13.388
How's your donger, you bugger?
You look like a bloody pirate!

01:24:13.488 --> 01:24:16.972
Fellas, I'd like you to meet
a mate of mine. This is Archy.

01:24:17.072 --> 01:24:19.013
This here's Barney.

01:24:19.113 --> 01:24:21.097
- Billy.
- How's it going?

01:24:21.197 --> 01:24:24.680
- This little bloke here is Snowy.
- G'day. Where are you from?

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.954
Out in the bush.

01:24:27.405 --> 01:24:29.430
Nice to meet you all.

01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.430
- Has he been talking about us?
- You know Frank.

01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.722
He likes the sound of his own voice.

01:24:34.822 --> 01:24:36.306
I know more about you
than your mothers.

01:24:36.406 --> 01:24:37.703
I should hope so!

01:24:40.364 --> 01:24:43.723
What you're telling me, sir,
correct me if I'm wrong,

01:24:43.823 --> 01:24:47.806
is the infantry attack and our attack
on the Nek are just diversions.

01:24:47.906 --> 01:24:52.331
Not just diversions, Major,
vitally important diversions.

01:24:53.698 --> 01:24:57.743
Tonight, 25,000 British troops
will land here at Suvla Bay.

01:24:58.823 --> 01:25:02.963
Our attacks are to draw the Turks
on us so the British can get ashore.

01:25:03.989 --> 01:25:07.474
Sorry I didn't tell you
this before, secrecy is vital.

01:25:07.574 --> 01:25:09.515
But, sir, the Nek is a fortress,

01:25:09.615 --> 01:25:12.557
with five machine guns
at point blank range.

01:25:12.657 --> 01:25:14.057
We've considered that.

01:25:14.157 --> 01:25:17.432
We'll hit them with the heaviest barrage
of the campaign

01:25:17.532 --> 01:25:20.749
just before your men go over the top.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:24.724
By the time we've finished,
there won't be a Turk within miles.

01:25:24.824 --> 01:25:28.599
The Turks can keep us pinned down
at Anzac forever.

01:25:28.699 --> 01:25:31.807
This new British landing
is our only hope.

01:25:31.907 --> 01:25:35.349
We must do what we can
to make it succeed.

01:25:35.449 --> 01:25:40.141
Because if it does succeed,
we'll have Constantinople in a week...

01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:43.266
and knock Turkey out of the war.

01:25:43.366 --> 01:25:47.308
- So, everything's ready?
- All the guns are in position.

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:51.100
We start the bombardment at dawn
and stop at 0430, sharp.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.459
That's... just over
twelve hours from now.

01:26:00.283 --> 01:26:05.225
"Your name has been selected
at random by the Ladies' Auxiliary."

01:26:05.325 --> 01:26:10.711
Da-da-da..."We hope this parcel
does its bit to keep up morale."

01:26:11.242 --> 01:26:13.416
Look at this.

01:26:13.576 --> 01:26:16.851
Crikey, they chose
the measurements at random, too.

01:26:16.951 --> 01:26:20.214
Some soap, ointment, lavender water...

01:26:20.659 --> 01:26:22.892
talcum powder, Eno's...

01:26:22.992 --> 01:26:25.476
The old ducks have sent
half a chemists'.

01:26:25.576 --> 01:26:28.684
A cook book?!
What do they think it is, a picnic?

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:32.726
- It's the thought that counts.
- It'd count more if they'd think.

01:26:32.826 --> 01:26:34.726
Oh! That does it.

01:26:34.826 --> 01:26:40.128
The bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago
sent me a bill for seven and six!

01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:44.547
How's the time?

01:26:44.743 --> 01:26:46.917
Half past four.

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:52.133
- When are you going over?
- Half past five.

01:26:54.452 --> 01:26:58.018
- You going for the ridge?
- No. What's it called?

01:26:58.118 --> 01:27:00.292
Lone Pine.

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.185
- What are you blokes doing?
- We're going for the Nek tomorrow.

01:27:05.285 --> 01:27:09.018
The Nek? Turks got machine guns
everywhere up there.

01:27:09.118 --> 01:27:13.046
Ships' guns gonna knock 'em out
before we go over.

01:27:15.328 --> 01:27:16.936
Like a drink?

01:27:17.036 --> 01:27:22.311
Go on, Snow. The Lord won't mind,
he turns a blind eye before a battle.

01:27:22.411 --> 01:27:24.585
He's right.

01:27:27.661 --> 01:27:29.882
Hey, you beauty, Snowy.

01:27:36.203 --> 01:27:38.459
When are they going?

01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:42.936
Right about now.

01:28:17.288 --> 01:28:19.711
Serious cases to the tent.

01:28:20.871 --> 01:28:23.969
Slightly wounded over here.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:34.335
Put him aside.
Down to the tent with that one.

01:28:39.205 --> 01:28:42.396
Morphine! We need some more
morphine over here!

01:28:42.496 --> 01:28:44.670
All right, mate.

01:28:46.996 --> 01:28:51.305
You'll be all right, mate...
be back in Adelaide in no time.

01:28:51.956 --> 01:28:56.564
Anyone seen Billy Lewis?
Barney Wilson? Snow?

01:28:58.664 --> 01:29:01.466
Hey, mate, you seen Billy Lewis?

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:07.175
Bill? You... you all right?

01:29:08.539 --> 01:29:10.511
Barney's dead.

01:29:15.664 --> 01:29:18.679
He was runnin' alongside of me and...

01:29:19.581 --> 01:29:21.886
I thought he just tripped.

01:29:25.582 --> 01:29:27.968
You know how clumsy he is.

01:29:31.832 --> 01:29:33.175
Snow?

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:40.815
They won't give me any food
or anything to drink.

01:29:40.915 --> 01:29:45.648
- Why do you reckon that is?
- They know what they're doing, Snow.

01:29:45.748 --> 01:29:49.107
We got there, but, Frank.
We took their bloody trenches.

01:29:49.207 --> 01:29:53.253
Yeah, Billy said you were a real hero.

01:30:01.333 --> 01:30:04.715
Just give me diary to Mum
and Dad, will ya?

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.968
I just want them to know what I did.

01:30:23.249 --> 01:30:25.424
Another bleeder for ya.

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:42.141
Hey.

01:30:43.542 --> 01:30:45.183
Oi!

01:30:54.167 --> 01:30:58.760
Come on, no Turk in his right mind's
gonna waste a bullet on you.

01:31:09.293 --> 01:31:13.008
- Get some sleep, mate.
- Yeah.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.465
That's you, mate.

01:31:27.794 --> 01:31:29.968
Here's one. You hungry?

01:31:37.752 --> 01:31:40.175
Sharp enough for you, sir?

01:31:42.877 --> 01:31:45.300
Nine and five sixteenths, eh?

01:31:46.294 --> 01:31:50.361
Kimberley Gift.
You're Archy Hamilton, aren't you?

01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:52.717
Excuse me, sir.

01:31:53.544 --> 01:31:58.017
Don't worry, I'm not going to turn you in.
I'm proud to have you.

01:31:58.212 --> 01:31:59.278
Thank you, sir.

01:31:59.378 --> 01:32:02.678
Matter of fact,
I want you as a runner tomorrow.

01:32:02.962 --> 01:32:04.987
But, sir... l'd rather fight.

01:32:05.087 --> 01:32:08.820
A few extra yards of speed
could save the lives of hundreds of men.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.070
I've come a long way,
I can't miss out.

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:15.362
I need a runner. Communications
won't last once the shelling starts.

01:32:15.462 --> 01:32:20.070
You could use Frank. He's just
as fast and I got him into this.

01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:23.054
He wanted to start a bike shop.

01:32:23.962 --> 01:32:26.301
- Is he scared?
- No, sir.

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.393
Well, just a bit.

01:32:32.379 --> 01:32:34.553
Who isn't, son?

01:33:54.256 --> 01:33:56.430
Do you mind?

01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:02.865
- Dunne, report to Major Barton.
- What the hell for?

01:34:02.965 --> 01:34:07.190
You're off the hook.
He needs a runner. Go on, hop to it.

01:34:10.966 --> 01:34:15.106
Can I have your luck? Malish, fate.

01:34:20.632 --> 01:34:23.979
Well... see you when I see you.

01:34:28.632 --> 01:34:30.853
Not if I see you first.

01:34:38.008 --> 01:34:39.767
Fix bayonets.

01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.266
Fix bayonets, first wave.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.186
First wave, fix bayonets.

01:34:49.508 --> 01:34:51.682
First wave, fix bayonets.

01:34:52.967 --> 01:34:55.141
Fix your bayonets.

01:34:55.842 --> 01:34:57.814
Dunne.

01:34:58.883 --> 01:35:01.057
Keep your heads down!

01:35:03.383 --> 01:35:05.059
Fire!

01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:25.784
"I know you haven't forgiven
me for running off,

01:35:25.884 --> 01:35:30.368
"but I'm sure in my own mind I was right.
So would you if you were here.

01:35:30.468 --> 01:35:34.284
"We're getting ready for an all-out
assault on Johnny Turk,

01:35:34.384 --> 01:35:38.284
"and we know we're going to give
a good account of our country.

01:35:38.384 --> 01:35:40.535
"Everyone is terribly excited.

01:35:40.635 --> 01:35:45.642
"There's a feeling we're all in
an adventure that's larger than life."

01:35:48.969 --> 01:35:51.143
Cease-fire!

01:35:51.385 --> 01:35:53.310
Cease-fire!

01:35:59.594 --> 01:36:01.270
Jesus!

01:36:01.677 --> 01:36:05.369
Shouldn't have stopped yet, sir.
There's still seven minutes.

01:36:05.469 --> 01:36:07.660
Maybe they're luring the Turks back.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.523
Dunne, get on to headquarters,
find out what's happening.

01:36:14.345 --> 01:36:17.411
- What's happened?
- Damned if I know.

01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:21.036
If the Turks get back in the trenches
we'll be cut to pieces.

01:36:21.136 --> 01:36:25.728
- They'll make another final burst.
- They're going back in the trenches.

01:36:31.345 --> 01:36:32.745
Colonel Robinson.

01:36:32.845 --> 01:36:36.078
- Barton, sir.
- I don't care what your watches say.

01:36:36.178 --> 01:36:38.911
They should have gone
three minutes ago.

01:36:39.011 --> 01:36:43.287
- Sir, they're back in the trenches.
- I know. I still say you must go.

01:36:43.387 --> 01:36:45.810
Look to your front, boys.

01:36:47.012 --> 01:36:48.902
Yes, sir.

01:36:50.929 --> 01:36:52.829
It's too late now.

01:36:52.929 --> 01:36:54.954
We go ahead, as planned.

01:36:55.054 --> 01:36:59.662
Come on, lads. Unload your rifles.
We're going in with the bayonets.

01:36:59.762 --> 01:37:04.371
No bullets. Nothing up the spout.
We're going in with the bayonets.

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.608
Steady, lads. Wait for it!

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:34.104
Come on, lads!

01:37:39.138 --> 01:37:44.191
Get ready, second wave!
Leave the wounded and get up to the wall!

01:37:56.098 --> 01:37:57.276
Les?

01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:00.317
Stick with me, mate.

01:38:05.473 --> 01:38:07.498
Second wave, get ready.

01:38:07.598 --> 01:38:12.402
- Keep moving! Get up to the wall.
- Close to the wall, men!

01:38:16.889 --> 01:38:19.657
Come on, boys, face to the wall!

01:38:21.557 --> 01:38:24.165
OK, lads, look to your front.

01:38:52.475 --> 01:38:54.916
Third wave, take positions.

01:38:55.016 --> 01:38:57.458
I'm not sending
any more men out into that.

01:38:57.558 --> 01:39:02.529
Come on, boys.
Third wave, get up to the wall.

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:08.375
What's happening, Lieutenant?

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:10.625
It's all pretty confusing, sir.

01:39:10.725 --> 01:39:14.625
- Has it been a success, or not?
- Well, it's hard to say, sir.

01:39:14.725 --> 01:39:18.000
One of our marker flags
was seen in the enemy trench.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.084
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello, sir?

01:39:23.184 --> 01:39:25.772
Hello? Hello!

01:39:28.809 --> 01:39:30.209
Damn! Dunne.

01:39:30.309 --> 01:39:32.959
Third wave, take up your positions.

01:39:33.059 --> 01:39:36.334
Stretcher-bearers,
get me some stretcher-bearers.

01:39:36.434 --> 01:39:39.449
- Line cut?
- Yes, sir.

01:39:39.934 --> 01:39:41.959
Take that to the Colonel.

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:45.690
I've said it once before,
now face the wall!

01:39:46.517 --> 01:39:49.188
Gangway! Urgent message
for Colonel Robinson.

01:39:52.602 --> 01:39:55.085
Two more men here, quickly.

01:40:01.352 --> 01:40:03.793
Third wave, fix your bayonets!

01:40:03.893 --> 01:40:07.572
No bullets! Bayonets only.

01:40:16.018 --> 01:40:19.002
Tell Major Barton
the attack must proceed.

01:40:19.102 --> 01:40:21.877
Sir, I don't think you got the picture.

01:40:21.977 --> 01:40:24.669
They're being cut down
within five yards.

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:29.461
Bloody line. Our marker flags
have been seen in the Turkish trenches.

01:40:29.561 --> 01:40:32.836
The attack must continue at all costs.

01:40:32.936 --> 01:40:35.987
I repeat, the attack must proceed.

01:41:05.812 --> 01:41:07.986
Steady, lads.

01:41:24.354 --> 01:41:27.213
Who told him there were marker flags?

01:41:27.313 --> 01:41:29.838
I heard someone say
they'd seen one, sir.

01:41:29.938 --> 01:41:32.963
- Who? Who?!
- I'm not sure, sir.

01:41:33.063 --> 01:41:36.921
Gray, you bloody idiot.
Nobody got further than ten yards.

01:41:37.021 --> 01:41:40.238
Why don't you go above
Robinson's head, sir?

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.505
General Gardner. Go like the wind.

01:41:46.605 --> 01:41:52.204
Message for GHQ! Message for GHQ!
Urgent message! Urgent message!

01:42:06.022 --> 01:42:07.615
Jesus!

01:42:57.065 --> 01:43:00.090
It does sound pointless.
On the other hand...

01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:02.799
Sir, the British are at Suvla.

01:43:02.899 --> 01:43:05.716
- Are they meeting heavy opposition?
- None, sir.

01:43:05.816 --> 01:43:10.216
Apparently the officers are sitting
on the beach drinking cups of tea.

01:43:10.316 --> 01:43:13.331
Tell Major Barton the attack is...

01:43:14.066 --> 01:43:17.117
Just tell him I'm reconsidering
the situation.

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:19.284
Yes, sir.

01:44:25.693 --> 01:44:28.551
They're not going to make us go,
are they?

01:44:28.651 --> 01:44:30.825
No, there's no point.

01:44:39.361 --> 01:44:42.594
They should have gone, Barton.
Flags have been seen.

01:44:42.694 --> 01:44:46.302
Not by me, sir. I've asked for
confirmation from General Gardner.

01:44:46.402 --> 01:44:48.636
Your orders are to attack.

01:44:48.736 --> 01:44:51.844
The British must be allowed ashore.
Is that clear?

01:44:51.944 --> 01:44:54.677
- You are to push on.
- It's cold-blooded murder.

01:44:54.777 --> 01:44:56.702
I said push on.

01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:01.333
Right, sir.

01:45:03.236 --> 01:45:06.867
Can't ask the men to do
what I wouldn't do myself.

01:45:11.903 --> 01:45:13.928
All right, men...

01:45:14.028 --> 01:45:16.202
We're going.

01:45:17.987 --> 01:45:21.085
I want you all to remember who you are.

01:45:22.153 --> 01:45:26.413
You're the Tenth Light Horse!
Men from Western Australia.

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.970
Don't forget it.

01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:31.012
Good luck.

01:45:31.112 --> 01:45:34.458
- Good luck, sir.
- You too.

01:46:21.905 --> 01:46:25.180
...though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:28.347
I shall fear no evil,
for God art with me.

01:46:28.447 --> 01:46:31.514
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

01:46:31.614 --> 01:46:33.788
My cup runneth...

01:46:49.781 --> 01:46:54.788
What are your legs?
Springs. Steel springs.

01:46:56.740 --> 01:47:01.710
What are they going to do?
They're going to hurl me down the track.

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:04.164
How fast can you run?

01:47:05.156 --> 01:47:07.330
As fast as a leopard.

01:47:07.656 --> 01:47:10.056
How fast are you going to run?

01:47:10.156 --> 01:47:12.348
As fast as a leopard!

01:47:12.448 --> 01:47:15.002
Then let's see you do it!

01:47:20.699 --> 01:47:24.460
Gangway! Gangway!
Gangway! Urgent message!
