WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:08.370
- What it is we're hunting?
- Animal, vegetable, mineral.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.126
I know you boys think
I'm a bag of loose screws.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.129
Martin saved Dad
more than we can count.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.563
- He's a great hunter.
- No, I'm not. I'm useless.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.044
You asked me if I lost someone.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.409
I did. My husband.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.562
- Amelia? You okay?
- It's Don.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.561
He's alive.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.924
I'm Benny.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.567
I just might be that hunter that runs
into Benny one day and ices him.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.047
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.486
Yeah.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.967
Yeah, you keep saying that.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.888
I sent Anthony home,
so the kitchen's all yours.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.520
Be sure to lock up the door,
and set the alarm...

01:11.680 --> 01:14.570
...turn off the a.c., check the burners,
check the griddle...

01:14.760 --> 01:18.560
And clear off the cold table.
I got it. Go on now.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.128
Thank you, Roy.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.723
Oh, and, uh, don't forget
to Z out the register.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.360
And batch out the credit-card machines?
I know.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.564
Darling, it's not my first rodeo,
all right?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.042
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.246
Hell of a girl, that Elizabeth.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.882
Yeah. Yeah, she really is.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.166
- Refill?
- Sure.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.964
You got designs?

01:52.960 --> 01:57.807
No. She's more like a little sister to me,
you know?

01:58.240 --> 02:00.402
So you don't mind if I take a shot?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.650
She's all yours, chief.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.525
Hey.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.081
Please?

02:22.520 --> 02:24.329
Thanks.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.771
Yeah. And you're certain?

03:50.080 --> 03:53.846
You sure? Okay, great. Just hang
tight until you hear from me, okay?

03:54.480 --> 03:56.130
Who is it?

03:56.280 --> 03:59.124
No, listen to me. I said hang tight.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.565
We gotta get.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.202
Can I at least finish my burger?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.931
We got a vamp kill, Dean.
Carencro, Louisiana.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.571
Huh.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.610
It's been a while
since I've had some étouffée.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.923
- Who's the source?
- Martin Creaser.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.329
Sorry, for a minute there
I thought you said Martin Creaser.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.324
Crazy Martin? From the loony bin?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.482
Glendale Springs discharged him
last month.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.484
And? Shouldn't he be assembling toys
in a padded room?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.881
- What's he doing back on the job?
- I asked him.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.082
- You what?
- He called me when he got out.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.961
Okay? Asked if I had anything that might
help him ease back into the game.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.726
He seemed okay, mostly,
so I said yes.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.324
I've had him tracking Benny
for the past week.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.243
You put mostly-okay Martin on Benny?

04:55.480 --> 04:57.687
What is mostly-okay doing
hunting at all?

04:57.840 --> 05:00.525
Not hunting, Dean. Tracking.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.081
Observe and report only.
I was clear about that.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.204
- I can't believe that.
- Really, Dean? You don't believe that?

05:06.360 --> 05:07.600
Because Benny's a vampire.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.367
And any hunter worth his salt isn't
gonna let one just walk around freely.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.770
So I had Martin keep tabs on him. And
it's looking like I made the right call.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.570
- So Martin's saying Benny did this?
- Yeah.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.600
Okay.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.609
Okay?

05:28.720 --> 05:31.644
If Benny's in Louisiana draining folks...

05:31.880 --> 05:34.042
...we should look into it.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.125
You said look for an eruption.
How's Mount Vesuvius?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.769
I got into town about a week ago.
Up until last night, nothing.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.605
- He's been clean.
- Doing what?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.366
Minding his own business,
working at the Gumbo Shack.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.047
- Benny's working at the Gumbo Shack?
- Yeah.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.084
Slinging hash, pouring coffee,
the whole bit.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.242
And he may be Benny to you...

06:36.400 --> 06:38.641
...folks round here call him Roy.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.407
Martin, you sure you're running
on a full charge?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.601
Yeah. Yeah, I...

06:45.800 --> 06:49.168
Little shock therapy in the morning
and I'm... I'm good to go.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.801
Tell us what happened.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.725
So I followed him home,
just like every night.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.451
He turned up a path, I hear a scream.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.645
I catch up, then boom, there he is...

07:01.800 --> 07:04.804
...the old coot that Roy was eyeballing
at the joint, vamped.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.330
Wait, did you actually see Benny
kill the guy or not?

07:10.480 --> 07:12.801
- I saw enough.
- How can you be sure it was Benny...

07:12.960 --> 07:16.248
- ...if you didn't see him?
- Because I saw Benny turn up the path...

07:16.400 --> 07:19.643
...and two seconds later,
I trip over a body with its throat ripped.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.485
Look, man,
you ever hear of Occam's razor?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.321
Keep it simple, stupid.
It's not that complicated.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.403
- There's a lot of holes, Martin.
- Holes?

07:27.560 --> 07:30.484
The only holes we should be looking at
are in the vic's neck.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.811
- This sound like the Benny you know?
- I don't know Benny.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.486
The Benny you know? Say what?

07:36.680 --> 07:40.401
Why am I getting the impression that
your brother is vouching for a vampire?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.523
- Let's not argue.
- Nobody's arguing.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.160
- But if this is Benny, and that's a big if...
- It's him.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.970
I got history with the guy.
Okay?

07:47.120 --> 07:50.010
I'm not signing up for a witch-hunt.
I owe him more than that.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.444
What in God's great creation
could a Winchester...

07:54.600 --> 07:55.840
...possibly owe a vampire?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.809
Am I hearing this right?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.650
Look, until we get the facts...

07:59.800 --> 08:02.451
...we stow the bloodlust
and we work this case right...

08:02.600 --> 08:03.965
...or we work it separately.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.124
Doing it right would be separating
his head from his shoulders.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.965
- I need some time.
- And let the fang take another life?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.168
- I don't think so.
- How much time you need?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.687
- You're not considering this?
- Couple hours tops.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.686
- And what if it turns out to be Benny?
- Then it's Benny and I'll deal with it.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.164
Couple hours, Dean. No more.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.766
I'll be in touch.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.891
Hey. Look.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.565
Hey.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.720
You're joking, right?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.522
We're doing this
as soon as he pulls away.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.568
No, we're not, Martin.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.802
We're gonna give him
a little bit of time.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.288
Well, hey, he's your brother.
It's your call.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.165
How long you gonna let him go on like this?
It's staring him right in the face.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.561
Well, sometimes it's not easy
to see things for what they are.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.528
Get the ball. Come here.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.844
Come here.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.449
Come here. Good job.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.840
You thought about
what you're gonna say to him?

09:27.720 --> 09:31.520
I've thought about it and thought about it,
and I still don't know.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.965
I'm sure you have a lot of people telling
you what the right thing to do is here.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.451
Sam.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.602
He's your husband, Amelia.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.123
But I... I don't...

09:48.480 --> 09:51.802
I don't wanna do the right thing.
This is the right thing, you and me.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.646
Maybe I'm going to hell for saying this,
but I'm not ready to give this up.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.564
Neither am I.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.482
Would it bother you if I just took
a few days to clear my head?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.244
Um...

10:15.400 --> 10:18.768
Of course.
Take whatever time you need.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.248
- Okay, put it on the tab.
- Okay, all right.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.802
- Actually, I already know what I want.
- Let me guess. Gumbo?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.322
It was gonna be the gumbo
until I saw...

10:44.520 --> 10:45.681
...pie.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.884
Well, special is pecan.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.682
Of course it is. Let's do that.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.963
Ooh. Bad news.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.530
You're out of pecan.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.441
Story of my life. That's all right.
Maybe you can make it up to me.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.881
I'm actually looking
for an old friend of mine.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.725
I heard he's kicking around these parts.
His name's Roy.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.805
Well, Roy works the night shift here.
If we're talking about the same Roy.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.251
Yeah, he putts around
in a beat-up camper.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.971
- Thing looks like a rolling death trap.
- Ha.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.245
Here I thought I was the only one who
gave him trouble over that piece of junk.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.722
You wouldn't happen to know where
he's parking that thing, would you?

11:31.960 --> 11:35.487
Well, he was parking it out back,
but he just called to tell me...

11:35.640 --> 11:38.246
...he's gone up the road
to Mill Creek for a few days.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.727
Okay. Uh, did he say why?

11:41.160 --> 11:44.004
Oh. Fishing, I think.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.205
He really deserves a break.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.681
He's been working doubles
for the last two weeks straight.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.923
Uh, listen, I... I tell you what.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.845
If he pops up before I can find him...

11:55.000 --> 11:58.607
...do me a favor,
just have him give me a buzz.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.760
Or you could just drop a dime yourself.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.289
Sure thing.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.001
- "Dean."
- And, uh, you are?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.281
Elizabeth.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.131
Elizabeth. All right.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.601
Take a rain check on that pie.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.564
Definitely.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.642
Leave a message at the beep.

12:29.800 --> 12:34.283
Benny, I got a body here in Carencro
with two holes in it...

12:34.520 --> 12:37.205
...and I just found out
you went fishing.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.324
Do I need to tell you
what this looks like?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.369
It's not me, Dean.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.361
Which me are we talking about,
Benny or Roy?

13:42.640 --> 13:44.369
I'm just trying to blend in.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.803
Blend in.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.046
Who'd you plant, Benny?

13:51.960 --> 13:53.610
Victim number two.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.969
You're concerned
about the missed calls.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.202
I didn't wanna get you involved.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.042
Now, wanna safety that thing...

14:07.240 --> 14:08.969
...talk a little bit, or what?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.365
I'm all ears.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.486
Rogue vamp.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.922
Came into the café
a couple nights ago.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.084
Youngster.
Goes by the name of Desmond.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.323
He, uh, remembers me
from the good old days.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.930
The good old days?

14:42.120 --> 14:46.205
I know it's hard to believe, but I haven't
always been this cute and cuddly.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.048
He's chasing a memory, Dean.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.283
That's all.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.568
He's crewing up a new nest.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.451
He's hoping I can give him some cred.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.285
I told him no.

15:01.760 --> 15:06.448
All right. So far so good.
Let's get to the part about the blood.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.287
He didn't wanna take no
for an answer.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.965
He's trying to roust me out...

15:14.120 --> 15:18.205
...leaving dead bodies in my wake
till I sign up.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.805
Two bodies in two days.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.770
No amateur is gonna kick me
out of my own hometown, Dean.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.160
Not this time.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.450
Hometown?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.045
You grew up here?

15:31.320 --> 15:33.163
Born and bred.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.610
With Andrea gone
and you hunting again...

15:38.600 --> 15:41.649
...it seemed like the right time
for a homecoming.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.123
You two being the only ones
who keep all my ducks in a row.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.324
Went back to my old job at the café...

15:49.680 --> 15:52.843
...and I even found someone
to hold myself accountable to.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.291
The best kind of someone, Dean.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.006
Family.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.251
Huh.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.320
Elizabeth.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.605
My great-granddaughter.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.764
Really?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.009
Now, hold it now, you didn't...?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.527
Uh, no. Ha.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.046
Does she know?

16:23.160 --> 16:27.165
No. No, as far as she's concerned,
I'm just another drifter.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.522
I'd like to keep it that way.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.010
It's been tough walking the line here...

16:33.160 --> 16:37.131
...after all those years in purgatory
not having to deal with the hunger.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.562
But Elizabeth...

16:40.320 --> 16:42.209
...she keeps me honest.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.647
I finally feel
like got a handle on this thing.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.690
Handle on things?
Benny, you got two stiffs on your hands...

16:47.840 --> 16:49.569
...and two hunters on your ass.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.361
Please. That half-wit who found me
at the café? I'll take my chances.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.329
That half-wit was sent by my brother.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.290
Trust me, m brother's not
someone Y you wanna mess with.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.367
I don't have time
to worry about them, Dean.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.406
I didn't think Desmond had an ounce of
steel in his spine, but I was wrong.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.325
So now I gotta do
what I should have done two days ago...

17:11.480 --> 17:14.324
...which is put him back
where he belongs.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.526
You know there's only one way
to do that, right?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.084
For you to sit on the sideline...

17:22.240 --> 17:25.084
...while I convince Sam and Martin
to go after Desmond.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.404
They see you, they don't care if you're
collecting for the March of Dimes.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.724
They're gonna slice first and
ask questions later. You know that.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.244
You really think they'll go for that?

17:43.840 --> 17:45.444
Let me get this straight.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.523
I follow your boy...

17:48.960 --> 17:53.045
...down a frigging path
and trip over fresh vamp kill...

17:53.400 --> 17:59.123
...and then you practically catch him
in the act of burying a second body...

17:59.640 --> 18:01.722
...and you're still taking his side?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.611
Vampires pick people off
from the outskirts of town, okay?

18:07.280 --> 18:10.807
Not in the cafes that they work in
with their great-grandkids.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.486
In fact, killing any human,
it's not his style.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.768
Not his style?

18:16.120 --> 18:18.441
Not his style?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.802
Listen, Dean.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.803
We came here on a dead body.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.971
You asked for some time
and now there's another dead body.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.769
Are we just going on trust here?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.640
Yes.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.122
Okay, because we've killed
for a lot less.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.282
You know how these things
turn out for us.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.680
Yes I do, too well.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.481
In fact, every relationship I've ever had
has gone to crap at some point.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.605
But the one thing I can say about Benny,
he has never let me down.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.803
Well, good on you, Dean.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.806
It must feel great finally finding someone
you can trust after all these years.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.923
All I'm saying
is that Benny is innocent.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.123
Ahem. No.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.521
You're too close to this.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.281
You're not gonna find him.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.361
And if you do, I'm gonna tell you this.
You'll be lucky to get out alive.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.124
And you, you go with him?

19:23.280 --> 19:25.931
You're a dead man, period.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.006
These are innocent lives
we're talking about, Dean.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.891
And you're willing to risk that
on Benny's word alone?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.209
Damn right I am.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.691
- What was that?
- Dean made his choice.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.004
Let's go do our job.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.411
I'm glad your dad wasn't around
to hear that.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.927
He'd have a mind
to take you both out the shed...

19:55.080 --> 19:58.084
...and show you what's what.
I'm half inclined to do it myself.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.086
Listen to me. I brought you into this,
I can bring you out, just as easy.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.007
The only thing you're gonna be inclined
to do is shut up and follow my lead.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.683
Okay. You say so.

20:15.240 --> 20:19.006
Just saying, brother chooses a vampire
over a brother?

20:19.160 --> 20:20.889
I know how I'd feel.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.287
You are Sam, right?

20:39.280 --> 20:42.489
Relax. I ain't here to fight.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.891
I heard about what happened to you.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.803
Rough deal.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.451
Yeah, well, I appreciate that.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.527
We got ourselves a situation here now,
though, don't we?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.050
I guess we do.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.607
Truth is I can't blame either of you
for what happened.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.528
Hell, there were days there
I thought I was a dead man.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.481
But when I do come back...

21:24.640 --> 21:27.405
...and what I come back to is this...

21:27.560 --> 21:29.847
...it ain't no mystery
if part of me's thinking:

21:30.040 --> 21:32.327
"What's wrong with this picture?"

21:32.480 --> 21:35.404
- Don...
- Sam, let me finish.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.967
I know part of her loves me...

21:43.480 --> 21:48.042
...and now part of her loves you.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.928
But the only one that knows
what's best for Amelia is Amelia.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.085
So when all of this is said and done
and she's made her decision...

21:59.680 --> 22:01.842
...I'll respect it.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.480
And if you truly love her,
you do the same.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.005
He could use another.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.722
Come on.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.087
- What'd they say?
- They didn't go for it.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.925
They're on their way to you.
I'd get scarce.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.443
No offense, Dean, but your little brother
doesn't exactly put chills up my spine.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.763
Benny, listen to me, do not
underestimate my little brother, okay?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.922
He can and will kill you
given the chance.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.246
All right.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.405
So, what now?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.286
I go find Desmond.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.130
You take me with.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.966
Hey, I just told you,
best thing you can do is lay low.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.282
That ain't gonna work this time, bub.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.081
You take me with
or I don't tell you where he is.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.810
You know where he is?

23:30.760 --> 23:34.082
He said he's not gonna stop the killing
till I join his little nest.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.288
Two bodies is enough.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.044
I told him I'm in.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.281
Benny.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.205
Dean, this is my fight.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.487
Are you in or are you out?

23:55.240 --> 23:57.083
Something spooked him.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.247
Sam. Sam.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.689
Sam.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.201
Sam.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.686
Winchesters, man.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.642
This is the place, huh?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.843
So, what's the plan?

25:01.360 --> 25:05.729
I hang back while you guys do
some trust falls and binge drinking?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.570
If I didn't know you better...

25:08.720 --> 25:12.042
...I'd say you have an extremely
low opinion of us vamps.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.402
Call it healthy skepticism.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.608
Benny never told me
he was bringing a friend.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.603
You're not gonna talk a lot, are you?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.886
I have been dealing with crazy...

26:17.240 --> 26:18.810
...all day.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.288
Son of a...

26:43.600 --> 26:45.204
It took you long enough.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.287
You've lost a step, friend.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.286
You need to lay off the junk food.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.450
Ah.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.931
You okay?

27:04.440 --> 27:06.283
I'm fine.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.285
My life here is over, isn't it?

27:27.760 --> 27:29.524
Afraid so.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.167
Once word gets out...

27:35.440 --> 27:38.410
The machete swingers
that'll come for you...

27:38.920 --> 27:41.287
...you can't take them all,
it's impossible.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.684
And even if you could...

27:45.000 --> 27:46.809
We'd have a problem.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.725
Guys like us, we don't get a home.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.526
You know, we don't get family.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.647
You got Sam.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.369
Yeah.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.044
Benny,
you gotta go deep underground...

28:09.360 --> 28:12.011
...where nobody knows who you are.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.330
Yeah.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.201
I got one last thing I gotta do.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.887
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.364
What are you doing?

28:46.680 --> 28:48.921
I'm, uh... Ahem.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.041
I'm leaving.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.889
What?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.604
- Don found you at the bar.
- Amelia.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.250
- He threatened you.
- Amelia.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.528
No, he didn't threaten me.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.764
Look, I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

29:06.920 --> 29:10.811
The right thing? This morning you and I
were the right thing, remember?

29:13.200 --> 29:17.125
I know that you and Don
deserve a chance, okay?

29:17.280 --> 29:18.770
And I think you know that too.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.922
Just give him a chance.
Like you gave me.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.645
I mean...

29:31.600 --> 29:33.284
...Amelia, you saved me.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.323
Time to go, buddy.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.571
Thanks for not giving up on me,
brother.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.802
Don't give me a reason to.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.321
Hey, Dean.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.484
I'm calling to let you know
that the situation is resolved.

30:47.640 --> 30:51.087
Benny was not lying, there was another vamp
and we ganked him, together.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.490
- Oh, that's good, Dean.
- Yeah, shut up and listen to me.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.689
Benny's long gone,
and he won't be coming back ever.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.208
So for your own sake,
do not follow him.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.521
Are we clear?

31:02.680 --> 31:06.162
You don't have to worry about me, Dean.
I'm long gone too.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.409
- Oh, and, Martin.
- Yeah?

31:10.880 --> 31:13.201
Find a new line of work.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.851
Hey, Liz.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.727
How's your shift going?

31:39.200 --> 31:43.364
I'd say she's covering for you just fine,
Benny.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.205
It's us regulars, we miss you.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.291
Who is this?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.528
I think you know who this is.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.241
How the hell you get her phone?

31:55.760 --> 31:58.081
- You enjoy the cherry?
- No.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.369
I'm sorry. Not quite done yet.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.765
- Did you reach your friend okay?
- I did. Thanks.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.605
I can't believe
I left my cell on the bus.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.969
The wife says I'd lose my own head
if it wasn't screwed on.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.640
- I'll just be another minute.
- You take your time.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.290
Thank you.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.285
She's a nice girl.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.011
Takes kindly to strangers.

32:24.480 --> 32:28.724
You leave her alone, now.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.610
How far away are you?

32:34.800 --> 32:36.211
An hour.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.201
You got 45 minutes.

32:43.640 --> 32:47.725
Miss, your cell phone.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.124
Lay down your arms, you unholy thing.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.167
You got me here now.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.568
Why don't you just let her go
and walk away?

33:30.040 --> 33:32.008
I don't think so.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.691
You realize I'm not asking?

33:36.960 --> 33:39.201
I realize that completely.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.089
Roy, what's going on?

33:46.640 --> 33:48.642
It's okay, Lizzy.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.484
He ain't gonna hurt you.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.642
Ain't that right?

33:53.160 --> 33:56.767
Come on, now. I got no beef with you,
you got no beef with me.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.366
- I got plenty of beef with your kind.
- All right.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.362
That may be so,
but not for anything that happened here.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.891
I did not kill those people.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.371
I heard.

34:06.560 --> 34:11.885
You and Dean had a little
purgatory reunion. Touching.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.886
Roy, please just tell me
what's going on here.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.608
Please, I'm asking you. Do not do this.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.371
The bad guy is gone, okay?

34:25.239 --> 34:27.083
She doesn't know.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.571
Benny.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.929
ROY

34:32.080 --> 34:33.320
...who's Benny?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.603
Who's Benny?

34:38.560 --> 34:41.040
Let's find out, shall we?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.610
Stay back.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.926
Look, look.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.844
See that? Dilated pupils.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.049
Hair standing.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.929
Signs of hunger.

34:59.400 --> 35:04.247
Don't worry,
he won't feed off his own flesh and blood.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.400
Flesh and blood?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.290
Tell her, Benny.

35:12.920 --> 35:17.289
Tell her how you're her
long-lost grandpappy.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.011
Tell her about
all the dead you left behind.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.164
Tell her about the monster
that you are.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.525
What do you want?

35:40.960 --> 35:42.962
Isn't it obvious?

35:43.160 --> 35:46.642
I want your head on a stake.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.841
Roy, no.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.170
No.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.488
I'm sorry.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.447
Well, hope they're saving
a special place for you.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.646
- Wherever it is you've come from.
- No!

37:41.440 --> 37:42.805
I feel all right tonight

37:49.600 --> 37:51.921
- Yeah.
- Dean?

37:52.120 --> 37:53.281
Hey. Hang on.

37:55.760 --> 37:56.807
Elizabeth?

37:58.280 --> 38:03.127
You told me to call you if I saw him.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.126
What do you mean? Roy?

38:06.280 --> 38:08.328
Is he there right now?

38:08.520 --> 38:10.761
Elizabeth, what's going on?

38:11.040 --> 38:13.327
Just come.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.129
Sammy?

40:19.040 --> 40:22.203
"Sam, I need your help. Come quick."

40:23.200 --> 40:24.850
Nice one.

40:25.520 --> 40:29.525
Swapping Amelia's phone out with a burner,
sending a distress signal.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.091
You got me good.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.921
- When did you do that?
- Awhile back, in case I needed it.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.764
Looks like I made the right call.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.849
So did you see her?

40:40.040 --> 40:41.849
Yeah. Yeah, I saw her. Ahem.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.123
She's doing just fine.
But, of course, you know that.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.090
Actually, I didn't.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.971
I did know it was the only way
to get you to lay off.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.368
Ha. So...

40:54.600 --> 40:55.806
...is it done?

40:56.920 --> 40:58.888
Yeah, it's done.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.963
Any casualties?

41:02.240 --> 41:03.287
Martin.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.491
Was it Benny?

41:09.600 --> 41:13.047
He had it coming, Sam.
I'll tell you what happened.

41:13.240 --> 41:17.768
- I know what happened, Dean.
- Okay, you wanna listen to me or not?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.611
Damn it.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.201
I knew that was you.
