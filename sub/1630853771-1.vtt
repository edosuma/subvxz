00:44.425 --> 00:47.752
Over 300 criminals head overseas
to flee from the police every year

00:47.753 --> 00:50.258
Many of them hide in Southeast Asia

00:50.259 --> 00:53.845
and continue their criminal activitis
against Korean tourists and businessmen

00:56.654 --> 01:01.449

SONS SUKKU

01:20.764 --> 01:24.133
PARK JI-HWAN

01:42.627 --> 01:45.522
Isn't it great? It's close to the city too

01:45.523 --> 01:48.417
It's the perfect spot to build your resort

01:49.023 --> 01:50.621
Why isn't this area developed yet?

01:50.622 --> 01:52.738
It was the site of semiconductor factory

01:53.041 --> 01:55.892
but that plan got scrapped it'll
be changed to a tourist zone

01:56.282 --> 02:01.077
With such prime location and view
it'll be a major tourist hotspot

02:03.109 --> 02:04.750
Who am I meeting today?

02:05.097 --> 02:08.509
He has a big rental car business,
he's dying to meet you

02:09.418 --> 02:10.627
How much did he pay you?

02:10.628 --> 02:12.096
It's not like that

02:12.442 --> 02:13.175
You so got paid.

02:13.176 --> 02:16.070
Do I look like someone who'd take bribes?

02:17.282 --> 02:19.311
He’ll do anything to get on your good side

02:24.929 --> 02:27.348
Mr. Choi how's your hangover?

02:27.349 --> 02:30.157
Why was last nights beer tap so much?

02:30.158 --> 02:33.570
I got to drink Louis XIII
for the first time thanks to you

02:34.133 --> 02:36.594
And you let him drink that?
You should've stopped them!

02:36.596 --> 02:38.324
But you won a ton

02:38.325 --> 02:39.663
Winning is one thing,

02:39.664 --> 02:43.119
spend money wisely don't
dump it all on booze

02:43.942 --> 02:46.101
Let's finish up and get hangover soup

02:46.102 --> 02:48.607
This guy was begging to see you in person

02:48.910 --> 02:49.731
He's got some money

02:49.732 --> 02:51.847
He doesn't do business only with Koreans

02:52.540 --> 02:54.526
He's got a few buildings in Ho Chi Minh too

02:58.762 --> 03:00.014
Mr. Choi Yong-gi?

03:00.879 --> 03:01.656

03:04.033 --> 03:04.637
Hop in

03:05.114 --> 03:06.711
Have a great chat

03:08.138 --> 03:09.434
Aren't you hot?

03:10.169 --> 03:10.989
Having a snack?

03:13.020 --> 03:14.748
You should eat something good

03:23.909 --> 03:26.846
So Jong-hoon tells me you
run a huge rental car biz

03:27.194 --> 03:28.791
You're filthy rich, I hear

03:28.792 --> 03:29.439
What?

03:30.996 --> 03:32.248
You son of a bitch

03:32.249 --> 03:33.242
Asshole!

03:37.002 --> 03:38.341
Lift up your head!

03:43.613 --> 03:45.859
You bastards what's the matter with you?!

03:46.335 --> 03:47.846
What is it?! You fuckers!

03:48.149 --> 03:49.358
Move aside

03:53.378 --> 03:55.667
Do I look like I run a rental car business?

03:57.785 --> 03:58.648
Do I?

04:06.859 --> 04:08.283
You're kidnapped

04:11.180 --> 04:15.024
THE ROUNDUP
(The Outlaws 2)

04:16.667 --> 04:18.653
Buddy! Drop the knife

04:18.741 --> 04:19.518
Heady! Bud!

04:19.520 --> 04:22.110

04:22.112 --> 04:24.616

04:34.038 --> 04:35.894
Damn! Not answering again

04:36.932 --> 04:38.876
Here! Over here!

04:40.951 --> 04:42.894
This way, this way!

04:42.895 --> 04:43.975
Afternoon, captain!

04:43.976 --> 04:45.444
- Here here
- Where is he?

04:45.747 --> 04:46.610
He's inside

04:46.654 --> 04:48.079
No, where's Seok-do?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.721
He's not answering the phone!

04:50.716 --> 04:51.752
Damn it...

04:56.981 --> 04:58.838
Drop the knife, Heady!

05:01.605 --> 05:02.900
Good to see you, sir.

05:04.067 --> 05:04.844
What's going on?

05:05.104 --> 05:06.270
What took you so long?!

05:08.431 --> 05:09.337
a blind date...

05:09.641 --> 05:11.196
How do you have weekly blind dates?

05:11.197 --> 05:12.880
He's gotta get married someday

05:13.271 --> 05:14.350
What's with him?

05:14.352 --> 05:16.726
He's known as Heady, a big nutjob for sure.

05:16.727 --> 05:17.721
Heady?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.708
He escaped from an asylum

05:19.709 --> 05:20.529
Hostage?

05:20.530 --> 05:22.992
Two, the shop keep randa college girl

05:22.993 --> 05:24.288
Should we just barge in?

05:24.289 --> 05:28.177
No.way! It's too dangerous,
let's get the SWAT

05:28.351 --> 05:30.985
We don't know what that lunatic will do...

05:30.986 --> 05:32.066
Where did they go?

05:32.067 --> 05:34.442
Go easy on him, there are too many eyes!

05:34.832 --> 05:36.084
You sons of bitches!

05:36.474 --> 05:38.029
Do you know how hard thugs have it?

05:38.030 --> 05:39.540
I know, I know

05:40.665 --> 05:42.090
My mom's from Suncheon!

05:42.091 --> 05:42.954
-What about her?
- She can't cook shit!

05:44.986 --> 05:47.318
Damn, I feel so bad for you

05:47.319 --> 05:51.078
Come inside
l'll give yo a scratch!

05:51.511 --> 05:53.626
Put the knife down!

05:54.146 --> 05:55.096
What the?!

05:58.380 --> 05:59.287
Goddamn..

05:59.634 --> 06:01.793
Shit, we're fucked!

06:04.300 --> 06:05.466
Yo, Heady!

06:05.597 --> 06:06.243
What are you gonna do?

06:06.244 --> 06:07.151
What ?!

06:07.152 --> 06:08.058
Come here, let's talk

06:08.060 --> 06:09.052
What ?!

06:09.788 --> 06:10.435
Stay back!

06:10.436 --> 06:11.516
Come on, man!

06:11.732 --> 06:13.244
- Don't come near me!
- Easy,easy.

06:13.245 --> 06:14.324
That's dangerous

06:14.325 --> 06:15.577
Hey, Heady

06:15.578 --> 06:17.738
Never seen me, right?
I've never seen you too.

06:18.559 --> 06:19.725
Do you trust me or not?

06:19.726 --> 06:20.891
What’s there to trust?!

06:21.368 --> 06:24.002
Put the knife down,
it’s really dangerous!

06:29.361 --> 06:30.355
Take them outside!

06:30.356 --> 06:31.434
Okay, Hong-seok!

06:31.435 --> 06:33.206
Please come out!
This way!

06:33.899 --> 06:35.841
Hurry,put them in the car!

06:36.664 --> 06:37.916
You son of a bitch.

06:38.047 --> 06:39.471
If you stab people with this knife,

06:39.472 --> 06:41.416
would it hurt or not?
Hurt or not?

06:42.065 --> 06:42.799
It hurts!

06:42.800 --> 06:43.792
You punk-ass.

06:44.787 --> 06:45.305
Get up.

06:48.978 --> 06:50.230
Goddamn!

06:53.212 --> 06:56.366
Bastard, are you a zombie or something?

06:59.910 --> 07:02.934
Get over here, no photos please!

07:04.231 --> 07:07.212
Police's excessive force,
12 weeks in rehab..

07:08.509 --> 07:10.841
How was this excessive force?

07:11.015 --> 07:13.002
Maybe we should have
asked the nutjob politely,

07:13.262 --> 07:15.681
"Excuse me,sir,
could you calm down?"

07:15.682 --> 07:19.656
They were cheering and clapping,
what a messed up article

07:20.564 --> 07:23.155
lt’s okay. I'm unrecognizable
with censored eyes

07:23.156 --> 07:25.229
Your body has to be censored
to be unrecognizable

07:25.230 --> 07:26.439
No, no one cant tell

07:27.304 --> 07:31.019
Honestly, anyone could mistake him
for a criminal with that face

07:31.020 --> 07:32.402
Our rookie's all grown up.

07:32.403 --> 07:36.031
He does kinda look like a Russian thug.

07:37.113 --> 07:40.871
If you look at it that way,
your captain's a terrorist

07:41.304 --> 07:44.327
His face has been drooping,
since high school days.

07:44.588 --> 07:45.235
Am I right?

07:45.970 --> 07:49.426
He kind of looks like
a village totem pole!

07:49.427 --> 07:51.889
His face expands and
contracts ending on the day

07:51.890 --> 07:53.833
- When I first met the captain
- Quiet,shut up!

07:53.835 --> 07:54.870
I almost cuffed him!

07:54.872 --> 07:56.556
Cuff what, asshole,
shut up, buddy.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.469
Having fun?
Are you happy?

08:05.156 --> 08:05.673
Hey man.

08:06.322 --> 08:10.210
You feel good to be on the newspaper?

08:11.723 --> 08:15.222
It's a sin to be a captain.

08:17.729 --> 08:19.197
Did they whoop you good?

08:19.976 --> 08:22.049
I'll go talk to the chief.

08:22.439 --> 08:24.123
Forget it, forget it.

08:24.556 --> 08:26.068
You need to go to Vietnam.

08:26.587 --> 08:27.579
Why there?

08:27.710 --> 08:29.221
Heard of Yoo Jong-hoon?

08:29.222 --> 08:29.913
No clue, who is he?

08:29.914 --> 08:33.456
it's those guys who robbed a
jewelry shop in Garibong district

08:33.457 --> 08:34.796
Yoo was the lookout

08:34.797 --> 08:36.999
These punks, l remember.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.586
He turned himself in
in Vietnam tor that case.

08:41.061 --> 08:41.752
Why?

08:41.753 --> 08:42.962
Who knows,

08:42.963 --> 08:46.245
so go fetch him, think of it
as a 3-day business trip.

08:46.246 --> 08:48.450
Going overseas for once.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.400
Who do i bring?

08:49.401 --> 08:52.252
Boss, my father is a
Vietnam war veteran

08:52.253 --> 08:53.635
It’s his son's turn to go there.

08:53.636 --> 08:56.573
Sir,my sister's friend's
close associate lives in Vietnam!

08:56.574 --> 08:58.344
- Whats with you?
- I'll do my best!

08:58.345 --> 09:00.894
- Look at this punk
- You got no seniority, piss off!

09:00.895 --> 09:01.974
You idiots!

09:02.882 --> 09:05.387
You think this is an
all-inclusive vacation?

09:05.561 --> 09:08.844
It's an important job to
repatriate a violent criminal!

09:10.660 --> 09:12.301
I'm gonna go with him.

09:13.296 --> 09:14.418
- Wait, hold on.
- What is it?

09:14.419 --> 09:17.486
You can't go, I need someone
who speaks English

09:17.487 --> 09:18.263
English?

09:18.264 --> 09:19.214
Can you speak English?

09:19.215 --> 09:20.986
You're asking me if I speak English?

09:21.202 --> 09:21.634
Prove it

09:21.635 --> 09:23.967
I like to order salad first

09:23.968 --> 09:24.658
But..

09:24.659 --> 09:25.954
no onion,

09:26.604 --> 09:28.591
no Balsamic vinegar.

09:28.937 --> 09:29.455
Happy?

09:29.456 --> 09:31.615
Wow. You speak English really well

09:31.616 --> 09:35.806
That's right, you'll be just fine
if you stay with me overseas!

09:35.807 --> 09:36.929
Forget it, forget it.

09:36.930 --> 09:40.040
No more on this,
trust me and follow my lead.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.726
Our captain is incredible!

09:47.042 --> 09:50.022
HO-CHI MINH
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

09:53.523 --> 09:54.819
Trust you,huh?

09:58.017 --> 09:59.312
These guys don't understand
British accent at all

09:59.313 --> 10:03.244
Man, the Balsamic vinegar
was a huge red flag...

10:03.936 --> 10:06.355
I always wanted to come here.

10:07.091 --> 10:08.515
Hey,excuse me.

10:08.516 --> 10:11.280
Hello? Hello? Hello?

10:12.059 --> 10:16.206
I, uh...
we're Korea police,police.

10:16.769 --> 10:19.188
We're really busy,
so we have to go.

10:19.405 --> 10:20.786
Out, okay? Out.

10:21.565 --> 10:22.687
Be quiet!

10:24.503 --> 10:25.929
Fuck, this guy doesn't
understand any English.

10:25.930 --> 10:27.916
Don't swear, I can speak Korean!

10:27.940 --> 10:28.940
Sit!

10:31.676 --> 10:32.712
Let's go sit.

10:34.398 --> 10:35.477
l'm really sorry

10:40.188 --> 10:41.182
Thank you

10:42.825 --> 10:45.113
My apologies,
I'm a bit late

10:45.331 --> 10:47.335
I'm Park Chang-su
resident officer at the consulate.

10:47.793 --> 10:50.169
So good to meet you!

10:50.256 --> 10:51.767
I'm. Capt. Jeon Il-man
from Geumcheon Police

10:51.768 --> 10:52.934
You're the captain!

10:52.935 --> 10:53.928
I'm Det. Ma Seok-do.

10:53.929 --> 10:55.310
- Detective...
- Hello, hello.

10:55.311 --> 10:59.026
My underling can't speak
any English at all,

10:59.027 --> 11:01.446
thats why we' re in this
laughable predicament

11:01.447 --> 11:03.391
- What the...
- Right.

11:03.780 --> 11:06.243
It's all right, should we
go for a meal first?

11:06.244 --> 11:08.317
Yes, absolutely!
Sure thing.

11:08.318 --> 11:10.218
- Grab all the luggage!
- Your luggage...

11:10.564 --> 11:11.687
Hey!

11:11.688 --> 11:13.847
Are there any good diners?

11:13.848 --> 11:14.322
Jeez...

11:24.952 --> 11:26.637
This is only $1? Really?

11:27.114 --> 11:28.667
- Yes
-   That’s incredible

11:28.842 --> 11:31.303
How could they travel without any cash?

11:31.304 --> 11:32.600
They were haggling nonstop

11:32.817 --> 11:34.890
Those bastards are Korean thugs.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.118
Korean thugs are dime a dozen.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.841
Many Korean shops opened up,
and gangs appeared alongside,

11:43.360 --> 11:45.174
and violent crimes rose as well.

11:46.341 --> 11:48.285
What the fuck is he looking at?

11:48.761 --> 11:51.137
Hi thugs, good to meet you.

11:51.483 --> 11:52.865
You travelled a long way
to Vietnam

11:52.866 --> 11:54.809
Fuck, he's a cop.

11:54.810 --> 11:57.618
- Seriously?
- You sure?

11:57.878 --> 12:01.031
Look at it, they got some
drugs and marijuana too.

12:01.032 --> 12:02.241
They look fishy.

12:02.242 --> 12:04.358
- That’s not marijuana.
- I'll be right back.

12:04.359 --> 12:06.734
Come on, you're mistaken!

12:06.735 --> 12:09.327
- But those bastards.
- We need a break, man!

12:09.328 --> 12:11.314
-  Look, they're leaving!
-  Let them!

12:11.315 --> 12:12.465
Are you Koreans?

12:13.044 --> 12:15.420
We're having a grand opening,
we'll treat you right.

12:15.421 --> 12:16.326
Korean again?

12:16.327 --> 12:18.055
Gangnam service
Ho Chi Minh price!

12:18.057 --> 12:20.950
Piss off!
Get that out of my face

12:22.248 --> 12:23.414
Detective Ma!

12:23.889 --> 12:25.185
Yo, Gasoline!

12:26.699 --> 12:27.648
Boss...

12:27.865 --> 12:30.371
Damn, what are you doing here?

12:30.934 --> 12:31.279
KOREAN KARAOKE

12:31.712 --> 12:34.562
Looking towards my future,

12:34.693 --> 12:36.766
I couldn’t continue living like
that in Korea.

12:37.285 --> 12:40.957
Then forget night jobs,
and do something in daylight.

12:41.477 --> 12:43.031
But he works so brightly.

12:43.248 --> 12:44.155
Who's this bastard?

12:44.156 --> 12:45.494
l'm Cooking Oil

12:46.532 --> 12:47.006
What the  hell...

12:48.044 --> 12:50.982
What brings you all here?
To catch a criminal?

12:50.983 --> 12:52.969
We're on a vacation.

12:52.970 --> 12:56.036
Boss you have to be careful.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.888
Korean police wield no power here.

12:58.889 --> 13:02.821
A ton of gangsters here
carry guns around.

13:02.822 --> 13:03.555
Guns?

13:03.556 --> 13:06.882
Yes.they got guns and
machetes this big,

13:07.185 --> 13:09.085
things are really different here.

13:10.254 --> 13:12.975
Who cares about that, we're on vacation.

13:13.408 --> 13:15.049
lt’s not like we'll ever get shot.

13:15.050 --> 13:17.079
- Then come have fun!
- Sure thing.

13:17.556 --> 13:18.592
All right.

13:18.593 --> 13:19.845
Gangnam service!

13:19.846 --> 13:20.968
At Ho Chi Minh price!

13:20.969 --> 13:23.604
CONSULATE GENERAL
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

13:23.605 --> 13:26.326
Consulate offices aren't
all that different from ours.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.271
Such a poor condition.

13:28.877 --> 13:31.079
At least we got air conditioning.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.634
Yeah, it’s really hot here.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.968
- How could anyone...
- Thank you for waiting!

13:36.136 --> 13:38.468
- lt's really hot.
- lt sure is.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.930
Are there many missing tourist cases?

13:40.931 --> 13:44.041
With 30.000 tourists a month,
there are quite a bit of those.

13:44.518 --> 13:46.591
Some disappear on their own.

13:46.938 --> 13:49.097
Money is always the problem.

13:49.487 --> 13:50.912
Please sign here.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.986
Once you submit this
to the immigration office,

13:52.987 --> 13:55.665
you can fly him out
after 10 AM tomorrow.

13:55.925 --> 13:57.695
Why are there so much paperwork?

13:57.696 --> 14:01.023
This is such a unique case.

14:01.802 --> 14:05.776
There's no precedent for a criminal
turning himself in to a consulate.

14:06.036 --> 14:08.844
We freed up a room
and kept him here,

14:09.364 --> 14:10.961
but it’s such a hassle for us.

14:11.697 --> 14:13.553
Why did he turn himself in?

14:15.542 --> 14:17.788
He felt a pang of guilt.

14:18.005 --> 14:19.473
What? He felt what?

14:21.073 --> 14:23.189
A pang of guilt.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.140
Pang of..

14:27.208 --> 14:28.244
A pang of guilt.

14:29.109 --> 14:31.960
Damn, I made a mistake,

14:32.566 --> 14:33.688
I signed 'Jeon Guilt.'

14:35.202 --> 14:36.670
Sorry about that.

14:42.935 --> 14:44.015
Hey Jong-hoon.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.607
Why did you turn yourself in?

14:47.818 --> 14:48.908
I'm so very remorseful.

14:51.448 --> 14:52.829
I'll receive my punishment in Korea.

14:52.830 --> 14:55.681
You want to serve
your time in Korea?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.557
You sure eat like a snake.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.323
Captain.

15:05.706 --> 15:07.045
To the Truth Room.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.379
Here?

15:14.002 --> 15:15.211
Okay, one sec.

15:15.602 --> 15:16.335
Give me that!

15:26.058 --> 15:27.050
All ready!

15:27.051 --> 15:29.254
Keep a look out.

15:29.557 --> 15:30.119
Okay!

15:32.841 --> 15:33.791
Relax, it’s okay

15:36.255 --> 15:37.896
Det. Ma can find out everything.

15:38.156 --> 15:40.575
What? Find what out?

15:41.051 --> 15:42.476
Why did you turn yourself in?

15:43.255 --> 15:44.118
I felt a pang of guilt...

15:44.421 --> 15:45.371
A pang of guilt?

15:49.174 --> 15:49.605
J- J- JD!

15:49.606 --> 15:51.420
J- J- JD!

15:52.934 --> 15:54.790
JD tried to kill me!

15:55.051 --> 15:58.377
Lee JD, that idiot
you kept around?

15:58.594 --> 15:59.759
He's here, yeah?

16:00.496 --> 16:01.618
No.

16:01.921 --> 16:02.698
No?

16:06.069 --> 16:07.969
Det. Ma can find out everything.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.642
Let’s take one of your ears.

16:11.643 --> 16:12.895
My ear,  my ear!

16:12.896 --> 16:15.487
Hey De. Ma
go easy on him!

16:15.488 --> 16:17.648
He's got too many ears, can take one of them.

16:17.649 --> 16:19.161
Buddy, spill it at once

16:19.162 --> 16:20.716
Why did JD tried to kill you?

16:20.717 --> 16:21.796
Hurts! lt hurts!

16:24.347 --> 16:26.679
I messed with JD's girl...

16:26.680 --> 16:27.743
Bastard, rip his ear off.

16:29.013 --> 16:32.555
lf JD is here,
then Ki-baek is too?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.672
The three of you are a set, you punk!

16:34.673 --> 16:35.536
No...

16:37.525 --> 16:38.629
All right, don't answer.

16:39.167 --> 16:42.536
Even if you don't say it,
Det. Ma can find out everything.

16:43.660 --> 16:46.382
Are you doing that thing?
Hold on,wait!

16:46.988 --> 16:48.197
You really shouldn't.

16:49.494 --> 16:51.538
Don't move, stay still,
you'll get hurt,

16:51.957 --> 16:53.727
If you move, you might die.

16:55.716 --> 16:56.882
Don't kill me!

16:59.216 --> 17:00.727
ls there construction?

17:01.074 --> 17:04.616
My eardrum's about to burst,
stop it, it hurts!

17:10.710 --> 17:12.178
You're not sure?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.597
But you're sure about JD?

17:16.110 --> 17:17.190
Yes...

17:18.919 --> 17:21.511
I don't think we should go
and get him on our own.

17:21.512 --> 17:24.664
Bringing in two perps instead of one
is instant promotion for you.

17:24.665 --> 17:27.992
No, we got no jurisdiction here.

17:27.993 --> 17:30.541
Investigation and arrest
are all illegal.

17:31.147 --> 17:34.170
Wel I just tell him nicely
to turn himself in, that's all.

17:34.171 --> 17:35.912
If you're involved,
it's an investigation!

17:35.943 --> 17:39.096
Blind dates you go on?
Those are investigations!

17:39.098 --> 17:41.344
What did Yoo say?

17:41.906 --> 17:43.850
He keeps saying bullshit.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.917
Captain. I'll submit this
to the immigration office then.

17:46.918 --> 17:47.912
Yes,sure.

17:47.913 --> 17:50.763
I have a friend in Ho Chi Minh
I gotta meet...

17:50.764 --> 17:51.411
I see.

17:51.412 --> 17:53.010
Do you know where this is?

17:53.011 --> 17:55.127
It's not too far from here.

17:55.387 --> 17:57.719
But it's a rough neighborhood.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.491
I'm okay with that.

18:00.357 --> 18:01.652
He's rougher.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.484
It’s over here.

18:14.831 --> 18:16.256
People are home.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.145
It’s locked.

18:21.312 --> 18:22.738
- Locked?
- Yeah.

18:29.479 --> 18:30.515
It's open now.

18:32.072 --> 18:34.619
How could you break that!

18:34.621 --> 18:37.169
JD, Jong-hoon spilled his guts.

18:37.602 --> 18:38.855
Let’s go home...

18:41.577 --> 18:43.953
What the hell?!

18:48.534 --> 18:49.484
Jeez...

18:49.658 --> 18:51.558
Goddamn, what happened?

18:53.806 --> 18:55.274
This is a murder.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.804
This messes things up.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.971
Call Mr. Park immediately.

19:07.114 --> 19:09.360
Buddy, get the hell up!

19:11.003 --> 19:12.817
You fucking dare to lie to me?

19:13.292 --> 19:14.415
What's going on?

19:14.719 --> 19:17.051
JD was murdered, asshole.

19:18.348 --> 19:21.069
What have you been doing?
Tell me everything.

19:21.502 --> 19:22.538
How's a beating first?

19:22.539 --> 19:24.871
Sir, deputy, this could
spark a big problem.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.507
Captain,
can you please stop him?

19:28.675 --> 19:29.711
Don't do it.

19:32.737 --> 19:35.717
Let's not do this,
I'll release you, just go.

19:35.891 --> 19:36.495
What?

19:36.496 --> 19:38.267
I think that's the best way,
get out of here.

19:38.268 --> 19:39.346
Go, come on, go.

19:39.347 --> 19:42.112
Detective, I turned myself in.

19:43.668 --> 19:44.445
Turned yourself in?

19:44.446 --> 19:45.914
l won't accept it, just go.

19:45.915 --> 19:46.778
Get over here!

19:46.779 --> 19:47.470
Get the hell out!

19:47.471 --> 19:49.069
I turned myself in, goddammit!

19:49.934 --> 19:52.655
"Goddammit"? You swore at me?

19:52.656 --> 19:54.081
- Detective!
- I'll escort you out.

19:54.082 --> 19:56.457
- Help! Please help!
- Let’s go, let’s go home!

19:56.458 --> 19:58.099
Wait, please!
What are you doing?!

19:58.100 --> 20:00.562
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

20:03.803 --> 20:07.345
We kidnapped a man here
with a guy named Kang Hae-sang!

20:08.341 --> 20:09.592
Who? Kang Hae-sang?

20:10.242 --> 20:13.827
He lured us to kidnap Choi Yong-gi,
who runs a resort business.

20:13.958 --> 20:15.512
Choi came from money.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.697
That young bloke was a chump
but spent money like a champ!

20:20.698 --> 20:21.648
Give me that.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.105
This is only $50.000.

20:26.878 --> 20:28.734
And this is barely $90.000.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.586
Which is less than
$20.000 per head.

20:31.717 --> 20:33.271
No fucking way.

20:33.705 --> 20:35.864
Asswipe, what happened?

20:35.865 --> 20:37.874
We went through all that mess
just for this?

20:38.198 --> 20:39.363
Speak your mind.

20:40.013 --> 20:40.919
Mr. JD,

20:41.309 --> 20:44.635
You said your friends are pros,
but they're amateurs.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.104
- What?
- Amateurs?

20:46.623 --> 20:47.919
Maybe they're simpletons.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.172
Fucking hell?!

20:55.050 --> 20:57.295
What did you just say, asshole?

20:57.296 --> 21:00.838
If it wasn't for Choi's money,
you'd already be dead.

21:01.704 --> 21:03.863
I went too easy on you.

21:04.598 --> 21:05.764
Fuckers.

21:07.234 --> 21:09.134
Don't want to make money?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.554
There's a limit to my patience.

21:12.031 --> 21:13.845
- Du-ik, you...
- Fucking bitch!

21:14.105 --> 21:15.616
Stop it!

21:17.648 --> 21:18.338
What in the world?!

21:18.987 --> 21:20.109
Get that bastard!

21:21.061 --> 21:23.264
- Stop right there!
- You fucker!

21:24.172 --> 21:25.425
We'll continue this chat.

21:26.030 --> 21:27.887
Get that fucker!

21:39.684 --> 21:41.239
Goddamn, you!

21:41.413 --> 21:42.923
You can't lose him!

21:43.789 --> 21:45.429
Stop right there!

21:47.072 --> 21:48.239
Get up!

21:49.968 --> 21:51.392
Grab him!

21:51.437 --> 21:52.819
Son of a bitch!

21:57.140 --> 21:58.824
You fucking bitch!

22:02.758 --> 22:04.312
Fuck, get over here!

22:05.826 --> 22:07.467
Fucking bastard!

22:07.813 --> 22:10.448
You got a death wish?

22:11.572 --> 22:12.652
Wait, please!

22:12.653 --> 22:17.793
I'll pay you $100.000 per head
that’s a promise!

22:17.794 --> 22:18.874
Fuck...

22:18.875 --> 22:19.392
$100.000per head!

22:19.393 --> 22:21.207
For real? You sure?

22:21.208 --> 22:24.923
I got $200.000 in my hotel room,
and some gold bars too.

22:24.924 --> 22:27.299
So what's the passcode?!

22:27.300 --> 22:29.244
2963! 2963!

22:29.245 --> 22:31.750
2963? That's the real one?

22:32.010 --> 22:36.071
We could've saved so much-trouble
if you let us borrow some earlier.

22:36.072 --> 22:36.978
Sorry.

22:37.368 --> 22:40.305
Why didn't you say so,
what are we doing here?

22:40.306 --> 22:43.805
We could open a resort
without that bastard!

22:43.806 --> 22:45.187
Look at this fucker.

22:45.188 --> 22:48.298
If you lie, you're as good as dead.

23:02.774 --> 23:04.718
He's dead?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.255
Are you out of your mind?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.588
How could you kill him?

23:11.935 --> 23:16.039
We gotta get paid
before chopping him up, asshole!

23:16.040 --> 23:17.551
Fucking bastard, money...

23:19.280 --> 23:20.878
What the fuck?!

23:30.039 --> 23:32.080
One less head means
more for all.

23:44.385 --> 23:47.883
What are you doing?
Dig properly, asshole!

23:57.045 --> 23:58.815
Working overseas sure is nice.

23:59.335 --> 24:02.445
Cops are loose,
easy to get the job done

24:02.922 --> 24:07.069
$200.000 and gold bars
from the hotel safe.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.280
That’s all?

24:11.218 --> 24:12.988
I could squeeze more out ot him.

24:15.453 --> 24:16.489
You there.

24:19.384 --> 24:20.378
Hold on.

25:08.254 --> 25:12.055
Mr. Choi here's your son's arm,
send $500.000 and he's yours.

25:12.056 --> 25:12.919
And then?

25:14.216 --> 25:18.191
2 days later, he got paid,
and JD and I just ran.

25:18.581 --> 25:20.697
With money in his hand,
he turned evil.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.758
For a few days now,
I sensed men following me.

25:26.099 --> 25:29.909
I think Kang sent his men to kill me!

25:32.018 --> 25:32.666
I'm sorry.

25:33.272 --> 25:35.431
You should've said so earlier!

25:36.642 --> 25:38.327
That’s why you turned yourself in?

25:38.328 --> 25:39.320
Yes...

25:39.624 --> 25:42.214
Kang must've killed JD.

25:42.734 --> 25:44.720
If he finds out that I'm here
I'm dead as well.

25:44.721 --> 25:48.566
Please send me to Korea, boss!

25:48.567 --> 25:51.202
Now what then?
We heard everything

25:52.585 --> 25:54.053
Let's find the bodies first.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.738
He's so excited.

25:55.739 --> 25:57.510
Write down the address here.

25:57.511 --> 25:58.720
- Address?
- Yeah.

25:59.239 --> 26:02.349
Deputy Captain,
this will cause headaches for a lot of people.

26:02.350 --> 26:05.935
Yeah, but l still need
the address.

26:06.541 --> 26:07.589
It’s okay, it’s okay.

26:08.227 --> 26:11.120
Captain, this has to be
handed over to the local police.

26:11.121 --> 26:13.540
Or he will be deported!

26:13.800 --> 26:15.355
Yes, please make that happen.

26:15.356 --> 26:15.873
Pardon?

26:15.874 --> 26:17.861
Please get him deported!

26:18.899 --> 26:20.713
Captain, I'm begging you.

26:21.837 --> 26:23.824
GEUMCHEON POLICE

26:25.942 --> 26:28.317
Boss, are you having fun?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.953
See if anything pops up
on one Kang Hae-sang,

26:33.245 --> 26:36.355
and a missing person report
on one Choi Yong-gi.

26:36.356 --> 26:38.126
Kang Hae-sang and Choi Yong-gi?

26:39.337 --> 26:40.762
Any other details to go on?

26:40.763 --> 26:41.713
Nothing else.

26:42.664 --> 26:43.873
Get on it.

26:44.176 --> 26:44.780
Yes, I understand.

26:45.603 --> 26:46.639
Thank you.

26:47.158 --> 26:49.145
So, what did they say?

26:49.664 --> 26:53.120
Cops don't sympathize
with other cops.

26:53.121 --> 26:55.453
lt'll take about a month
before a warrant is issued.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.693
Kang will fleer te another country
before then!

26:58.694 --> 27:00.422
Then what can.we do?
We're not in Korea.

27:00.423 --> 27:01.502
What can we do?

27:01.503 --> 27:03.490
Shouldn't you do Something?

27:03.966 --> 27:05.218
Nothing can be done.

27:05.219 --> 27:06.428
Like what?
Nothing can be done

27:06.688 --> 27:07.551
Damn it!

27:07.552 --> 27:08.631
Where are you going?

27:08.805 --> 27:11.699
Where is he off to now?

27:11.700 --> 27:14.767
Mr. Park,please go stop him,
he probably won't

27:15.330 --> 27:16.539
listen.

27:19.132 --> 27:20.428
Have you seen this person?

27:20.429 --> 27:22.112
I don't know what you mean.

27:22.114 --> 27:23.539
Can you understand him?

27:23.540 --> 27:25.050
A few months ago, I think.

27:25.312 --> 27:26.875
Seok-do, I now I can't stop you,

27:28.292 --> 27:29.761
but this isn't Garibong district.

27:31.144 --> 27:32.958
Hey,hey!

27:32.959 --> 27:33.995
Wait a minute!

27:33.996 --> 27:35.681
- Stop it,man!
- Stop doing that!

27:36.200 --> 27:37.884
What’s the matter with you?

27:37.885 --> 27:40.952
Just let me find this prick,
move out of the way.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.155
Wait!

27:43.286 --> 27:45.446
Det. Ma,you really can't do this

27:45.619 --> 27:47.649
Will you be responsible
for any problems?

27:47.650 --> 27:49.248
This is clearly an illegal activity!

27:49.249 --> 27:53.871
If this country's laws can't protect
our people, then shouldn't we?

27:53.872 --> 27:55.556
Seok-do, you're right, but...

27:55.557 --> 27:57.500
Am l wrong?

28:04.155 --> 28:05.364
Call the Cops.

28:05.841 --> 28:07.223
We'll all be arrested.

28:14.828 --> 28:17.981
Christ, is it even here?

28:20.186 --> 28:24.679
Are you gardening?
Hurry up and do it right!

28:24.680 --> 28:26.105
Here,here!

28:26.625 --> 28:27.661
lt's a worm...

28:28.050 --> 28:28.568
Damn it.

28:32.587 --> 28:33.234
What's this?

28:40.538 --> 28:41.833
Damn!

28:43.476 --> 28:45.981
Found it, it's right there!

28:46.328 --> 28:47.406
What?

28:48.531 --> 28:49.265
Holy cow!

28:49.525 --> 28:50.907
I got one here too!

28:51.426 --> 28:52.549
Another one?

28:55.229 --> 28:56.307
We're in hell,

28:56.308 --> 28:57.907
I'll notify the authorities.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.067
Four bodies in total.

29:15.709 --> 29:17.696
I really did come here
on a vacation.

29:18.302 --> 29:19.209
Detective, what's up?

29:19.210 --> 29:21.888
Have you heard of-Kang Hae-sang?

29:22.364 --> 29:23.313
What?

29:23.876 --> 29:25.690
You're after that bastard too?

29:26.252 --> 29:27.461
How do you know him?

29:28.629 --> 29:33.986
A local Korean thug named Raku
was looking for Kang

29:34.635 --> 29:35.887
about 3 days ago.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.529
Raku?

29:37.919 --> 29:39.905
- Where is he now?
- I don't know

29:40.857 --> 29:43.319
- Is something up?
- Look into it and call me ASAP!

29:43.320 --> 29:44.961
What is Korean detective doing here?!

29:44.962 --> 29:47.467
ls there a law in your country?!

29:47.814 --> 29:48.850
We'd like to apologize.

29:50.838 --> 29:52.695
You'll be responsible for this.

29:53.085 --> 29:54.294
Go back to your hotel!

29:55.073 --> 29:55.936
- What? Hotel?
- What did he say?

29:57.881 --> 29:59.867
I call your...

29:59.868 --> 30:01.855
We'ree cops too!

30:02.030 --> 30:04.620
How could we stand back
when our people are butchered?!

30:04.622 --> 30:05.096
Captain!

30:05.314 --> 30:07.041
Even if we don't have
any jurisdiction...

30:07.042 --> 30:08.942
Easy,easy.they're
pulling out their guns.

30:09.332 --> 30:11.059
But even so...

30:11.536 --> 30:13.436
I'll sort it out here,
please stay at the hotel.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.028
Okay, I understand,
sorry, sorry.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.836
I'm getting this fucker
no matter what.

30:19.745 --> 30:23.244
If we bring him to the consulate,
we could put him on a flight.

30:23.245 --> 30:26.139
How do we catch him?
You got a plan?

30:28.775 --> 30:29.869
Come with me.

30:42.386 --> 30:44.287
So humid..

30:50.293 --> 30:51.805
You're here?

30:51.806 --> 30:52.410
Where?

30:52.411 --> 30:53.317
Over here! Boss!

30:54.830 --> 30:55.866
Let’s go.

30:56.343 --> 30:57.681
Find it at once!

30:57.941 --> 31:00.360
There should be $500.000
in cash,so search thoroughly.

31:02.435 --> 31:04.379
You saw him with your own eyes?

31:04.380 --> 31:07.576
Yes. I'm sure.
I saw him myself.

31:08.226 --> 31:09.953
I saw Kang leave this morning.

31:10.819 --> 31:11.941
I found it!

31:15.139 --> 31:16.219
Good, you may go.

31:16.825 --> 31:17.817
Okay...

31:19.201 --> 31:20.281
Thank you.

31:21.621 --> 31:23.175
lt’s a lot.

31:25.423 --> 31:26.718
Look at this fucker.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.224
That’s gotta be way more than $1M.

31:29.744 --> 31:31.083
How many did he kill?

31:31.084 --> 31:32.681
Let’s send the money back first.

31:33.244 --> 31:34.194
Okay.

31:35.534 --> 31:37.996
Yes, we found it.

31:45.646 --> 31:46.768
What brings you here?

31:46.769 --> 31:47.978
A bus brought us here.

31:49.966 --> 31:51.607
Wow, just look at them.

31:52.342 --> 31:54.200
Look, a sea of Koreans.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.304
Hey,buddy!

32:00.293 --> 32:01.386
Come here!

32:02.799 --> 32:03.575
What is it?

32:03.576 --> 32:07.076
Fetch me Raku or Roku or whatever.

32:07.682 --> 32:08.718
Who are you people?

32:09.021 --> 32:11.224
They're all Korean hooligans.

32:11.311 --> 32:12.952
Boys, gather around!

32:13.299 --> 32:15.199
Oh, you guys are cops?

32:15.546 --> 32:17.532
Leave and save yourself
some bloodshed.

32:18.095 --> 32:18.483
ls he there?

32:19.218 --> 32:19.908
Where you going?

32:26.563 --> 32:27.254
Dude...

32:30.064 --> 32:31.532
Stay down.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.303
You'll get hurt!

32:34.125 --> 32:35.421
Just stay down.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.037
Stop!

32:48.038 --> 32:49.247
Stay on the ground.

32:49.465 --> 32:53.050
Why are fucking Korean po-pos
making noise on my property?

32:53.699 --> 32:55.210
Are you the local police/

32:55.211 --> 32:56.333
You're Raku?

32:56.334 --> 32:58.840
I am, motherfucker.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.281
Boss!

33:03.593 --> 33:04.629
And you are?

33:04.630 --> 33:05.753
I'm Cheeky.

33:05.754 --> 33:06.963
Don't be cheeky!

33:09.902 --> 33:10.895
Hey!

33:12.062 --> 33:13.358
You're all fucking dead bastards.

33:13.618 --> 33:16.641
This is Vietnam, not Korea
you fucking shit!

33:21.007 --> 33:23.900
Fuck, this is a real gun
you thought you could kill me?

33:23.901 --> 33:25.240
Come here, come here!

33:25.760 --> 33:27.789
- I'll kill you!
- Stay back!

33:28.222 --> 33:29.648
Stay the fuck back!

33:30.211 --> 33:32.326
Nobody move!

33:32.327 --> 33:34.487
Don't you dare to move!

33:37.772 --> 33:39.370
Stay where you are, assholes!

33:39.371 --> 33:42.092
Choose your words carefully,
or this is your last day.

33:42.093 --> 33:42.697
Yes, sir.

33:42.698 --> 33:43.993
Speak properly.

33:44.685 --> 33:46.024
Why did you look for Kang Hae-sang?

33:46.025 --> 33:49.049
We were paid to track him down,
I don't know the details.

33:49.309 --> 33:51.338
So who hired you?!

33:51.944 --> 33:55.530
Some mercs from Korea,
that’s all l know!

33:55.531 --> 33:56.610
Mercs?

33:57.302 --> 33:58.252
Yes, sir.

33:58.469 --> 33:59.980
So did you find Kang?

34:01.623 --> 34:03.653
He guided them.

34:04.561 --> 34:06.591
Yo, who are you?

34:07.629 --> 34:08.320
I'm Cheeky.

34:08.321 --> 34:10.221
You fucking cheeky monkey,
get over here!

34:11.993 --> 34:13.893
- I'll be back!
- See you soon!

34:17.567 --> 34:18.646
Where are you, sir?

34:18.647 --> 34:20.936
We're heading to Kang's location.

34:21.024 --> 34:22.189
Did you find anything?

34:22.364 --> 34:25.906
I asked an friend in the Intelligence
for Kang's files

34:25.907 --> 34:30.140
and strangely, Choi was
never reported missing.

34:30.141 --> 34:30.615
Yeah?

34:31.480 --> 34:35.109
What's the deal with his family?
What does his father do?

34:35.110 --> 34:38.263
Choi Choon-baek,
head of Joeun Capital,

34:38.264 --> 34:39.516
he's a glorified loan shark.

34:39.517 --> 34:41.115
Choi Choon-baek, I think
I've heard of him.

34:42.383 --> 34:43.211
He's infamous in Myeongdong,

34:44.400 --> 34:47.683
and main business is
lending money to corporations,

34:48.245 --> 34:51.787
daily cash transaction amount
is said to be in millions.

34:52.178 --> 34:54.855
But he never reported
his own son missing?

34:54.856 --> 34:56.022
Should I dig in further?

34:56.023 --> 34:57.664
Yeah,look into it.

34:57.924 --> 34:58.917
Okay.

34:59.869 --> 35:01.337
What did he say?

35:02.504 --> 35:06.564
It looks like Choi's father
sent mercs to kill the kidnappers.

35:27.652 --> 35:28.817
Let’s get ready.

37:08.631 --> 37:09.926
Look at this punk.

38:46.583 --> 38:47.187
Die!

38:57.127 --> 38:58.465
You from Korea?

39:28.842 --> 39:30.051
You took my money?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.587
Who sent you?

39:44.484 --> 39:45.822
Fuck you, asshole.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.853
Choi...
Choi Choon-baek!

39:56.150 --> 39:57.403
Choi Choon-baek?

39:57.792 --> 39:59.304
Yong-gi's father?

40:06.996 --> 40:10.106
JOEUN CAPITAL

40:15.507 --> 40:16.803
Mr. Choi,

40:18.576 --> 40:19.741
this is Kang Hae-sang.

40:20.433 --> 40:22.204
You're not dead yet?

40:22.637 --> 40:24.537
You sent men to kill me?

40:25.272 --> 40:27.691
You took my money
and killed my son,

40:28.427 --> 40:30.370
you thought you'd be safe?

40:30.588 --> 40:35.193
I said you'd get him back,
but didn't say he'd be alive.

40:36.150 --> 40:38.222
I...

40:39.532 --> 40:41.172
will kill you.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.870
Why did you take my money?

40:50.377 --> 40:51.586
Return it.

40:51.976 --> 40:53.790
Or I'm coming to Korea.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.240
His manners are fucked-up.

41:17.858 --> 41:19.629
Dude, wait a minute!

41:20.623 --> 41:21.054
All ready!

41:21.401 --> 41:22.999
Why did you bring the gun?

41:23.302 --> 41:25.505
i forgot to return this to him.

41:25.506 --> 41:26.585
Wait for me!

41:30.086 --> 41:31.295
The door's open.

41:32.290 --> 41:35.141
Dang,he got wind of it
and fled already.

41:39.722 --> 41:40.887
Holy shit!

41:40.888 --> 41:41.924
What the hell?

41:42.401 --> 41:43.869
What's all this?

41:45.512 --> 41:47.368
How many are dead here?

41:47.542 --> 41:49.227
I think we're too late.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.461
Damn it..

42:00.980 --> 42:02.923
Why are there so many bags?

42:04.437 --> 42:07.763
This fucker targeted Korean tourists.

42:09.406 --> 42:10.787
Look at these passports.

42:11.264 --> 42:12.429
What’s this?

42:13.899 --> 42:15.713
I found it, it’s Choi Yong-gi

42:16.146 --> 42:17.399
Jeez..

42:31.053 --> 42:32.565
Get over here,asshole.

42:51.405 --> 42:52.873
Fucking bastards...

42:54.084 --> 42:55.681
You're Kang Hae-sang?

43:03.158 --> 43:04.150
Police!

43:05.361 --> 43:06.656
Don't move...

43:08.990 --> 43:09.984
Drop the knife.

43:10.676 --> 43:12.100
Drop it,asshole!

43:24.935 --> 43:27.743
Get off! Son of a bitch!

43:38.763 --> 43:40.144
Come here asshole!

43:59.114 --> 43:59.847
Fuck...

44:04.255 --> 44:05.249
Goddammit!

44:09.960 --> 44:11.125
Captain!

44:12.898 --> 44:14.625
Bang! Bang!

44:14.842 --> 44:16.440
Fuck it...

44:16.960 --> 44:19.292
Useless piece of shit...

44:21.626 --> 44:22.878
THONG NHAT ARMY HOSPITAL

44:24.564 --> 44:26.594
Yes, I didn't know at all.

44:26.595 --> 44:32.038
But this happened because
they were working for our Korean Tourists,

44:32.039 --> 44:33.896
so if you decide to do that...

44:33.897 --> 44:36.359
Yes, I know the procedure,
Mr. Consulate,but...

44:37.656 --> 44:38.304
Seok-do..

44:38.305 --> 44:40.852
Let's catch him,
I'm so angry

44:41.026 --> 44:43.963
I catch him.
so get some rest.

44:43.964 --> 44:47.637
How could I?
can't even piss on my own...

44:47.638 --> 44:50.488
Call me when you need to piss, goddammit!

44:51.569 --> 44:57.099
By the way, how long
do we need to be locked up here?

44:57.791 --> 44:58.612
Hey, Hong-seok!

44:59.045 --> 45:01.333
Are you all right, boss?
How's the captain?

45:01.594 --> 45:04.359
Captain's good,
any updates on Kang?

45:04.360 --> 45:07.383
The Intelligence has been gathering
information on kidnapping

45:07.384 --> 45:09.630
and murder cases in Southeast Asia
against Korean tourists.

45:09.631 --> 45:11.445
The Philippines, Cambodia, etc.

45:11.446 --> 45:12.352
All four cases
resemble Kang's MO.

45:14.471 --> 45:17.969
Make contact, get friendly
kidnap,then demand ransom,

45:18.143 --> 45:20.475
but even after ransom,
none of them came back.

45:20.693 --> 45:21.988
How many in total?

45:21.989 --> 45:23.975
Four have been identified so far.

45:24.495 --> 45:25.358
Also, boss,

45:26.482 --> 45:29.593
the chief wants you to
stop causing trouble..

45:29.594 --> 45:31.062
All right! I'm hanging up!

45:31.451 --> 45:34.000
Captain,how are you feeling?

45:34.433 --> 45:34.820
It's okay.he's fine,
he's a crybaby.

45:37.112 --> 45:40.049
I told you stay at the hotel...

45:40.438 --> 45:41.388
Oh man..

45:41.907 --> 45:44.715
You two are being deported.

45:46.055 --> 45:46.617
What?

45:46.618 --> 45:49.425
The authorities will
take you to the airport.

45:49.426 --> 45:50.419
Wait a minute..

45:50.420 --> 45:51.671
Stay where you are.

45:51.672 --> 45:54.005
We have to arrest Kang here!

45:54.007 --> 45:56.165
Det. Ma, please.

45:57.118 --> 45:59.018
What exactly is the reason?

45:59.019 --> 46:01.265
you're going this far in
someone else's country?

46:01.611 --> 46:04.462
Should there be a reason
for wanting to catch a killer/

46:05.456 --> 46:07.400
A bad guy must be caught!

46:07.617 --> 46:10.640
We have to catch that bastard,
I won't leave without him!

46:10.641 --> 46:11.635
Never!

46:12.629 --> 46:13.579
I'm sorry about this.

46:13.580 --> 46:16.171
l won't leave. l'm too angry.

46:16.518 --> 46:17.598
I'm not leaving!

46:17.900 --> 46:18.894
Oh yeah.

46:19.629 --> 46:21.313
That tall bastard I brought in...

46:27.969 --> 46:28.961
What?

46:29.524 --> 46:31.380
Help me! Help me!

46:32.289 --> 46:34.664
The Korean detectives
in custody ran away!

46:34.665 --> 46:36.350
I need backup!

46:37.129 --> 46:39.072
Back up, back up, back up!

46:52.468 --> 46:54.065
Motherfucker..

46:55.190 --> 46:58.084
Buddy,where jest Kang Hae-sang?

46:59.770 --> 47:02.534
Are you gonna take the fall
for the eight bodies we found?

47:04.048 --> 47:06.640
The local police wil kill you
if you stay here.

47:08.455 --> 47:09.534
Buddy!

47:10.399 --> 47:12.472
Tell me where Kang is,

47:13.856 --> 47:16.102
and I'll repatriate you.

47:18.912 --> 47:20.422
Effective immediately!

47:20.899 --> 47:22.799
You'll be deported from Vietnam!

47:23.837 --> 47:25.133
Take him to the airport!

47:25.134 --> 47:26.256
No cuffs needed!

47:26.257 --> 47:28.157
I can't! l won't go!

47:28.158 --> 47:30.577
Hold up, stop! Stop!

47:30.578 --> 47:31.787
- Seok-do!
- Out of the way!

47:31.788 --> 47:33.471
Don't do that, come on!

47:33.948 --> 47:36.237
All right, we have to go!

47:36.238 --> 47:37.274
- Go!
-We have to!

47:37.275 --> 47:38.656
- Go where?
- To Korea!

47:38.657 --> 47:39.261
Why there?

47:39.262 --> 47:41.552
We’re being deported,
we must be deported!

47:41.726 --> 47:42.545
We are?

47:42.547 --> 47:44.015
Yes, obey the law!

47:44.016 --> 47:45.484
Translate for us.

47:45.787 --> 47:47.213
They'll cooperate.

47:47.214 --> 47:49.027
Let's go to the airport now!

47:49.028 --> 47:50.539
Us, Korea, speed, speed!

47:51.189 --> 47:52.872
Okay, let’s go, let’s go!

47:53.046 --> 47:54.990
- We have to go.
- Are you nuts?!

47:54.991 --> 47:56.286
We have to catch Kang!

47:56.979 --> 47:58.835
He's in Korea
to meet Choi Choon-baek.

47:59.917 --> 48:00.996
Let’s go!

48:04.626 --> 48:05.230
Hey boss.

48:05.534 --> 48:07.304
Look at this fuck
grinning like an idiot

48:07.305 --> 48:08.471
- Allow me.
- Yeah, here.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.538
Captain, look at you.

48:11.539 --> 48:12.575
Don't even mention it.

48:12.576 --> 48:16.896
l was ambushed by dozens
of baddies with machetes.

48:16.897 --> 48:17.718
Go rest up at home.

48:17.719 --> 48:19.792
Go rest... How could I?

48:19.793 --> 48:22.298
I need to head back
and report to the chief.

48:22.299 --> 48:24.327
- As the captain ...
- Give the captain his luggage.

48:24.328 --> 48:25.754
- Yes of course .
- Let's move quickly.

48:25.755 --> 48:27.179
What are you doing?

48:27.698 --> 48:29.685
You gotta carry this for me,
hey, Dong-gyun!

48:29.686 --> 48:31.241
Buddy,my hands!

48:31.544 --> 48:33.790
Flying around a in't easy.

48:33.791 --> 48:35.691
What a mess.

48:35.692 --> 48:40.185
Hong-seok and the rookie's
looking into smuggling vessels,

48:40.835 --> 48:42.908
he'll smuggle in, right?

48:42.909 --> 48:44.204
Yeah, I'm sure.

48:44.464 --> 48:46.969
The captain almost died.

48:48.699 --> 48:51.549
That vicious bastard,
I'm getting mad thinking about it.

48:51.550 --> 48:52.888
How could he stab a cop?

48:54.575 --> 48:56.562
Just give me one chance.

49:12.463 --> 49:13.888
Which floor are you here for?

49:14.234 --> 49:15.487
3rd floor

49:15.661 --> 49:16.480
Come with us.

49:16.481 --> 49:18.209
I'll  get it done right...

49:18.210 --> 49:19.116
Delivery!

49:19.117 --> 49:21.579
Those guys weren't my guys!

49:21.580 --> 49:22.443
Where should l put it?

49:22.444 --> 49:23.869
Just put it there!

49:24.345 --> 49:26.332
Sir! Sir!

49:28.537 --> 49:30.610
Fucking hell...

49:35.840 --> 49:36.659
Have a great meal.

49:40.506 --> 49:42.493
I'll turn this place upside down.

49:43.573 --> 49:46.900
Here eat this.he even ordered
sweet and sour pork.

49:46.901 --> 49:49.103
- Thanks for the meal.
- All of this for one?

49:52.259 --> 49:54.029
How did you know l was here?

49:54.030 --> 49:55.628
Ever heard of GPS?

49:55.629 --> 49:57.183
Everything is searchable.

49:57.659 --> 49:58.609
Asshole!

49:59.647 --> 50:02.282
Sit down, you illegal alien,
come sit down.

50:02.542 --> 50:06.171
I've been legal so long,
and ever since l almost died,

50:06.431 --> 50:08.288
I only do legal work.

50:08.548 --> 50:11.701
Finding work for illegal alien
is what you call legal?

50:11.702 --> 50:13.645
Enough, we got no time,

50:14.122 --> 50:17.016
give me intel on any vessels
coming in from China.

50:17.838 --> 50:19.825
I left that life so long ago!

50:20.431 --> 50:23.238
What's with your hand?
You rude mofo.

50:24.319 --> 50:27.041
I've had it with you,
it's been a while.

50:28.425 --> 50:29.461
Here.

50:31.276 --> 50:32.226
Listen here.

50:32.227 --> 50:33.133
Not coming?

50:33.610 --> 50:35.552
I'm not the same Jang Isu
from before!

50:36.289 --> 50:37.325
One.

50:38.665 --> 50:42.034
If you mess with me,
l won't take it on my ass!

50:42.338 --> 50:43.028
Two.

50:55.861 --> 50:56.811
Yeah...

50:58.281 --> 51:01.262
So anything came in
since yesterday?

51:03.639 --> 51:05.539
All right, I'm hanging up.

51:06.923 --> 51:07.657
Who was that?

51:08.738 --> 51:10.724
He's known as Captain One-eye

51:10.725 --> 51:13.230
He's the only game in town
when it comes to China.

51:13.231 --> 51:14.570
SKIPPER KIM GYO-BUM

51:14.571 --> 51:17.854
He said a new vessel
came into Goongpyong port.

51:17.855 --> 51:19.711
- Call Hong-seok.
- Calling.

51:21.528 --> 51:23.125
Hong-seok, where are you?

51:23.299 --> 51:26.582
Go to Goongpyongport and
get all security cam footages.

51:26.886 --> 51:27.749
Yeah,one sec.

51:30.731 --> 51:31.638
And    ?!

51:32.373 --> 51:33.712
That's it!

51:33.713 --> 51:34.360
That's all.

51:35.096 --> 51:37.341
You can't just barge in
and harass me!

51:37.342 --> 51:39.804
Shut your face and answer me
when l call, got that?

51:40.453 --> 51:41.619
Let’s move.

51:43.607 --> 51:46.112
You fucking bastard!

51:48.922 --> 51:50.692
- Did you call me?
- No, sir.

51:52.767 --> 51:55.100
What a fucking dickhead...

51:57.218 --> 51:59.420
GEUMCHEON POLICE

51:59.421 --> 52:02.099
GOONGPYUNGMART CAM #3

52:02.878 --> 52:03.958
Where is this?

52:03.959 --> 52:07.544
Parking lot behind the port,
I got nothing

52:08.842 --> 52:10.007
Check the next one.

52:13.638 --> 52:15.106
- Sir.
- What?

52:17.613 --> 52:20.334
This guy's suspicious,
he's checking tires.

52:20.681 --> 52:21.760
Maybe for car keys?

52:22.409 --> 52:24.179
Boss, I think we got something.

52:24.180 --> 52:25.087
You found him?

52:25.563 --> 52:26.556
Rewind it

52:27.508 --> 52:28.068
Let’s see

52:29.755 --> 52:30.531
Stop.

52:31.051 --> 52:31.828
Zoom in

52:33.254 --> 52:34.636
2608251...

52:34.637 --> 52:36.062
Yeah, that's him.

52:36.322 --> 52:38.697
- Send out an APB for it.
- We got you asshole.

52:48.724 --> 52:51.834
Chairman, seems like Kang
entered Korea

52:52.483 --> 52:54.253
Get some more mercs.

52:54.644 --> 52:56.068
Bring them from overseas.

52:57.021 --> 53:01.080
Give them 2 large upfront,
and another 2 after the job.

53:01.082 --> 53:03.242
Dead or alive.

53:03.890 --> 53:05.272
Yes, chairman.

53:25.408 --> 53:27.481
KOREAN COPS WERE
STABBED IN VIETNAM

53:27.482 --> 53:30.982
With your order, l sort it out
with the media.

53:31.674 --> 53:33.790
All right, go on.

53:37.982 --> 53:39.191
Ma Seok-do!

53:39.192 --> 53:41.870
I told you to keep a low profile.

53:42.087 --> 53:44.764
You made a big ass mess
to fuck with me, right?

53:44.938 --> 53:47.443
No way.
I was just trying to catch a perp.

53:48.654 --> 53:50.641
Why were you trying
to catch a perp there?!

53:50.643 --> 53:52.369
They got cops there too!

53:52.630 --> 53:56.432
And you, I sent you
to keep an eye on him,

53:56.433 --> 53:58.808
yet you fueled the fire,
and shot a gun too!

53:59.025 --> 54:01.487
l barely shot any,
it was busted.

54:02.655 --> 54:05.807
Why is this being handed over
to Foreign Affairs?

54:05.808 --> 54:08.876
We're about to close it
with security cam evidence,

54:08.877 --> 54:10.647
how could you hand it all over now?

54:10.648 --> 54:11.165
Yeah!

54:11.339 --> 54:12.851
I'm powerless on this!

54:13.067 --> 54:15.271
lt’s no use telling me!

54:16.006 --> 54:18.770
Always so powerless,
that's so weird.

54:21.536 --> 54:26.288
Our chief didnt read our report
thoroughly again right?

54:26.376 --> 54:27.412
- Again?!
- Yeah!

54:27.413 --> 54:28.579
No wonder

54:29.659 --> 54:30.653
What do you mean?

54:30.654 --> 54:35.362
Jeez, a total of four bodies
were uncovered in Vietnam.

54:35.752 --> 54:40.028
Of the missing Korean tourist cases
in the Philippines and Cambodia,

54:40.029 --> 54:42.189
Kang is suspected of four of them!

54:42.190 --> 54:42.707
Four!

54:42.708 --> 54:45.041
This guy is in a class of his own!

54:45.043 --> 54:47.287
That’s why Foreign Affairs
is taking over!

54:47.289 --> 54:50.140
If that's the end of it,
your call is the right one.

54:50.443 --> 54:51.782
There's something else?

54:51.783 --> 54:55.368
To seek revenge
for the death of his son,

54:55.369 --> 54:59.387
Choi's father sent Korean mercs
to kill Kang and his men!

54:59.603 --> 55:02.108
But Kang killed even those guys,

55:02.109 --> 55:04.269
and he's here to find
Choi Choon-baek!

55:04.270 --> 55:07.639
If Kang suddenly shows up,
would Choi just stay back?

55:07.899 --> 55:08.893
Isn't it insane?

55:09.239 --> 55:09.930
lt sure is.

55:10.449 --> 55:12.436
Choi will send out gangsters,

55:12.912 --> 55:14.423
Seoul will turn into a bloodbath!

55:14.640 --> 55:16.713
Then we'll be on TV.

55:16.714 --> 55:19.003
If that happens,
we're all dead.

55:19.004 --> 55:19.695
All dead.

55:19.696 --> 55:21.164
Especially you,
you're double dead!

55:21.424 --> 55:21.769
So dead.

55:21.770 --> 55:23.540
- As the head police!
- So head.

55:23.541 --> 55:26.478
You got that in the report?
That shit will hit the fan?

55:26.479 --> 55:30.410
I'm begging you, please!

55:30.411 --> 55:32.354
Read the report thoroughly

55:34.387 --> 55:36.287
I can stall them for a week.

55:36.288 --> 55:37.712
Close this case within a week!

55:37.714 --> 55:39.613
A week! You got it.

55:39.917 --> 55:41.170
A week!
A week!

55:41.430 --> 55:42.725
Nice! A week!

56:05.065 --> 56:08.650
You're the detective
who brought my boy back, right?

56:10.595 --> 56:11.675
Yes, ma'am.

56:15.953 --> 56:17.248
Thank you.

56:19.194 --> 56:20.662
Please stay for a meal.

56:21.960 --> 56:22.952
Yes, ma'am.

56:27.836 --> 56:28.699
She's his second wife.

56:29.520 --> 56:32.242
He never had any children
with his first before she died,

56:32.502 --> 56:33.193
and Choi Yong-gi
was his only offspring.

56:36.608 --> 56:38.032
No wonder he sent mercs.

56:38.033 --> 56:38.594
Yeah, I guess.

56:40.669 --> 56:42.612
This is a gangster sausage party.

56:43.262 --> 56:44.384
Yes,indeed.

56:45.638 --> 56:47.063
Beautiful weather.

56:47.452 --> 56:49.396
Do we get any gas stipend?

56:49.699 --> 56:52.335
You serious? Dumbass

56:53.286 --> 56:55.402
How many months financed?

56:55.576 --> 56:58.340
60 months. I got 59 left.

56:58.773 --> 57:02.142
Go easy with it,
don't use it on operations.

57:03.612 --> 57:04.260
Do you know how much
I cherish my baby?

57:04.261 --> 57:05.383
Isn't this a second-hand car?

57:05.384 --> 57:07.544
Yeah, Dong-gyun,
I got it.

57:09.662 --> 57:11.562
- Your keys.
- Why?

57:11.736 --> 57:14.327
Dong-gyun found Kang's car.
l'll go check it out.

57:14.328 --> 57:15.321
I'll come with you.

57:15.322 --> 57:18.216
No, you stay here and watch Choi,

57:18.217 --> 57:20.203
and rookie, watch
the cams thoroughly, got it?

57:20.204 --> 57:20.852
Yes,sir.

57:20.853 --> 57:22.667
- Give him your key,hurry.
- My key?

57:22.668 --> 57:25.129
Give me yours,
I like this type of car,a USB.

57:26.643 --> 57:28.025
It's SUV...

57:35.890 --> 57:37.963
Damn,didn't work.

57:46.778 --> 57:47.728
Boss.

57:48.074 --> 57:49.283
Did you get anything?

57:49.284 --> 57:51.616
Kang is so fucking meticulous.

57:51.963 --> 57:55.030
He wiped the vehicle down
before ditching it.

57:55.550 --> 57:57.147
No security cams nearby either.

57:57.926 --> 57:59.351
This won't be easy.

58:19.877 --> 58:22.079
They're standing by
in the lower parking lot.

58:22.339 --> 58:25.061
Theyre triad Chairman Ju's boys?

58:25.062 --> 58:26.918
Yes,they're a sure thing.

58:26.919 --> 58:29.338
If you fail this time,
you'll die first.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.288
Yes,sir.

58:32.277 --> 58:34.350
The chairman's heading down, standby.

58:44.635 --> 58:46.189
I'm coming down.

58:48.221 --> 58:49.344
Copy.

58:52.715 --> 58:53.794
Let’s go.

58:58.807 --> 59:00.102
Wait a sec.

59:01.399 --> 59:02.954
Who are those assholes?

59:16.307 --> 59:18.337
I don't see any resemblance...

59:26.548 --> 59:27.971
I'm Kang Hae-sang.

59:28.189 --> 59:28.965
You bastard!

59:38.342 --> 59:39.465
Die!

59:51.780 --> 59:53.594
Die,you fuck!

1:00:13.385 --> 1:00:15.156
I told you l'd come to Korea.

1:00:15.848 --> 1:00:17.230
Where's my money?

1:00:17.965 --> 1:00:19.909
Greet the chairman properly,

1:00:20.082 --> 1:00:22.415
and we just need to kill Kang Hae-sang.

1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:27.081
It’s just one guy,
this will be over quickly.

1:00:35.724 --> 1:00:37.062
What's going on here?

1:00:57.457 --> 1:00:58.752
Come here, asshole.

1:01:20.013 --> 1:01:21.308
It's been a while.

1:01:22.302 --> 1:01:23.987
Who are these fucks?

1:01:25.241 --> 1:01:26.752
Pay us more for them.

1:01:33.796 --> 1:01:35.826
What's that?

1:01:37.685 --> 1:01:38.159
Crap!

1:01:39.630 --> 1:01:41.962
Hong-seok! B1!

1:01:41.963 --> 1:01:43.819
Choi is being kidnapped!

1:01:46.499 --> 1:01:47.579
Out of the way!

1:01:48.271 --> 1:01:48.789
Shit!

1:01:56.826 --> 1:01:58.857
B1! Equus! Equus!

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:02.356
You fucker! Stop right there!

1:02:09.314 --> 1:02:10.350
Stop...

1:02:17.178 --> 1:02:18.516
Are you all right?

1:02:18.517 --> 1:02:19.856
Did you get the plate number?

1:02:19.881 --> 1:02:20.917
Yes...

1:02:24.825 --> 1:02:26.510
Is the camera on?

1:02:26.813 --> 1:02:28.325
Do you see this?

1:02:29.449 --> 1:02:32.041
His-head comes off tomorrow.

1:02:32.776 --> 1:02:33.725
Here.

1:02:34.116 --> 1:02:35.022
Okay.

1:02:38.005 --> 1:02:39.905
Have $2 M ready by tomorrow.

1:02:40.208 --> 1:02:41.676
Keep your phone on.

1:02:46.214 --> 1:02:48.936
When did you receive this?

1:02:51.053 --> 1:02:53.126
Last night by a courier.

1:02:58.312 --> 1:03:00.126
- Rewind it a bit.
- Okay.

1:03:02.331 --> 1:03:03.151
- They're brothers?
- Yes.

1:03:05.658 --> 1:03:07.472
Contract killing, armed robbery...

1:03:07.473 --> 1:03:11.620
These guys can't be recycled.

1:03:12.398 --> 1:03:15.639
They fled tothe Philippines
with warran,ts for their arrest

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:18.274
nd they were on Interpol's radar
over a Korean murder case.

1:03:18.578 --> 1:03:19.959
I checked their records,

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:23.416
and their stay in the Philippines
overlaps with Kang's by 6months.

1:03:26.139 --> 1:03:28.644
Was there one near
where the car was found?

1:03:30.935 --> 1:03:33.051
We're not getting any support,

1:03:33.052 --> 1:03:37.070
so go to Ilsan and look around
with patrols over there.

1:03:37.071 --> 1:03:38.582
Understood.

1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:47.181
Are we okay on our own?

1:03:47.354 --> 1:03:49.600
If things go sour,
we'll be on the hook.

1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:51.978
There's no time.

1:03:52.627 --> 1:03:57.724
He and Yong-gi may not
be clean, but they're my family.

1:03:59.411 --> 1:04:00.663
Please do whatever it takes
to arrest him.

1:04:04.423 --> 1:04:06.107
What can l do to help?

1:04:07.534 --> 1:04:09.304
So the thing is..

1:04:09.997 --> 1:04:12.027
We can't transfer the ransom.

1:04:12.071 --> 1:04:14.576
Once he sends it overseas
it’s untraceable.

1:04:14.793 --> 1:04:16.866
and we can't ensure
your husband's safety.

1:04:16.867 --> 1:04:19.977
So we have to
make the trade in person,

1:04:20.151 --> 1:04:22.267
we need you to lure him.

1:04:22.441 --> 1:04:24.817
Don't get worked up
while on the phone.

1:04:24.818 --> 1:04:27.106
We'll guide you along the way...

1:04:27.929 --> 1:04:29.439
I'm sorry to make you do this.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:29.871
No need to be sorry,
there's no other way.

1:04:36.268 --> 1:04:37.606
We got the call,
it's him!

1:04:37.607 --> 1:04:37.952
Get ready!

1:04:39.336 --> 1:04:41.107
- Quiet down,quiet!
- One moment.

1:04:41.928 --> 1:04:43.354
One,two,

1:04:43.614 --> 1:04:44.260
three.

1:04:44.392 --> 1:04:45.255
Please answer.

1:04:50.311 --> 1:04:51.217
Hello?

1:04:51.478 --> 1:04:53.119
This is Kang Hae-sang.

1:04:54.631 --> 1:04:57.267
This will go smoothly
if you follow my orders.

1:04:58.002 --> 1:04:59.081
Is the money ready?

1:04:59.816 --> 1:05:02.192
I'll send you my account info.

1:05:02.453 --> 1:05:03.704
- Are you an idiot?
- What?

1:05:04.181 --> 1:05:04.828
Why should l pay you $2M?

1:05:06.557 --> 1:05:07.420
Hold on.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:08.933
Give her a minute.

1:05:08.934 --> 1:05:09.970
You bastard.

1:05:10.489 --> 1:05:12.864
You killed my son even after
receiving the ransom.

1:05:13.687 --> 1:05:16.235
There's no guarantee
you'll let my husband go,

1:05:16.754 --> 1:05:18.525
so why should I
send you money?

1:05:18.613 --> 1:05:19.778
So you won't even try?

1:05:20.556 --> 1:05:22.284
If not, your husband will die for sure.

1:05:22.674 --> 1:05:24.100
I'd thank you for it.

1:05:25.310 --> 1:05:26.389
What?

1:05:26.995 --> 1:05:29.889
Buddy, you killed my son.

1:05:30.063 --> 1:05:33.087
If you kill my husband too,
who'll end up with his money?

1:05:33.822 --> 1:05:35.852
You'll flee the country, no?

1:05:36.372 --> 1:05:37.364
Am l right?

1:05:38.143 --> 1:05:40.605
I'll give you $2 M in cash.

1:05:41.816 --> 1:05:43.500
Trade with him in person.

1:05:43.501 --> 1:05:45.617
I'll hand it over
when l see him alive.

1:05:45.964 --> 1:05:47.907
You're a great negotiator.

1:05:49.463 --> 1:05:49.981
Okay.

1:05:51.624 --> 1:05:54.432
Bring $2 M in a suitcase tomorrow.

1:05:55.211 --> 1:05:59.400
If I find a tracker,
or if you mess with me,

1:05:59.401 --> 1:06:00.783
I'll kill your husband
and come after you.

1:06:00.784 --> 1:06:02.166
1 DRIVER

1:06:02.599 --> 1:06:03.938
Understand?

1:06:04.371 --> 1:06:07.783
Come to Ilsan Central Intersection
by 1 PM tomorrow alone.

1:06:08.648 --> 1:06:09.597
Did you get that?

1:06:10.247 --> 1:06:13.486
I can't drive,
I'll need a driver.

1:06:13.834 --> 1:06:14.782
Jesus Christ...

1:06:15.173 --> 1:06:15.863
No good?

1:06:16.599 --> 1:06:17.505
No deal?

1:06:17.982 --> 1:06:19.450
Just one driver?

1:06:19.666 --> 1:06:20.660
Okay

1:06:21.352 --> 1:06:23.381
Let’s do this right
and keep your hus..

1:06:28.784 --> 1:06:30.598
Bad manner runs in the family.

1:06:35.092 --> 1:06:36.085
Could I get some water?

1:06:36.086 --> 1:06:37.252
- Water!
- Yes, sir.

1:06:39.369 --> 1:06:40.751
You did great.

1:06:45.290 --> 1:06:46.671
Here, have some water.

1:06:59.808 --> 1:07:01.967
That lady is no joke.

1:07:02.573 --> 1:07:04.602
I really want to get this bastard.

1:07:05.338 --> 1:07:08.405
So who should we use
as the driver?

1:07:08.968 --> 1:07:10.997
We can't use one of ours
he'll clue in.

1:07:10.999 --> 1:07:12.120
Then who?

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:16.097
If we use a pushover,
this will go sour very fast.

1:07:23.054 --> 1:07:24.867
Fake marriage isn't a bad thing.

1:07:25.085 --> 1:07:27.719
All new lives start out that way.

1:07:28.325 --> 1:07:31.220
Just hang in there for 3 months.

1:07:34.850 --> 1:07:36.405
Did you bring the money?

1:07:39.905 --> 1:07:42.496
What is man's face?

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:44.225
What he look?

1:07:45.306 --> 1:07:47.163
He'll be here in a few.

1:07:51.312 --> 1:07:52.305
You punk!

1:07:52.306 --> 1:07:54.811
Ignoring my calls?
I'll fucking kill you!

1:07:55.028 --> 1:07:57.231
You just made me
drive across town.

1:07:57.750 --> 1:07:59.132
What's going on here?

1:07:59.133 --> 1:08:02.027
I'm barely making ends meet here.

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.446
What’s this?
Marital status form?

1:08:04.448 --> 1:08:05.744
You asshole!

1:08:05.745 --> 1:08:06.694
Excuse me.

1:08:06.695 --> 1:08:08.897
This guy is a con man,
please go home.

1:08:08.898 --> 1:08:10.971
Don't give him money,
go home.

1:08:11.189 --> 1:08:13.089
Please go, go home.

1:08:13.090 --> 1:08:14.990
He's an illegal alien.

1:08:16.115 --> 1:08:17.366
You're coming with me.

1:08:17.584 --> 1:08:20.089
I need you to drive let’s get going.

1:08:21.947 --> 1:08:24.064
Hey Jang! How have you been?

1:08:24.885 --> 1:08:26.958
Hey : One-eye
get me a boat.

1:08:26.959 --> 1:08:27.823
For which day?

1:08:28.342 --> 1:08:29.508
Tomorrow

1:08:29.509 --> 1:08:31.711
Tomorrow? So suddenly?

1:08:32.922 --> 1:08:35.168
That's gonna be tough.

1:08:35.558 --> 1:08:37.977
Unless l get some extra.

1:08:38.669 --> 1:08:39.748
I'll pay double

1:08:40.872 --> 1:08:41.779
Time and how many?

1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:43.076
1 AM, 3 people.

1:08:43.249 --> 1:08:45.624
1 AM. 3 people, okay.

1:08:46.057 --> 1:08:47.093
Okay.

1:08:49.903 --> 1:08:50.939
You vouch for him?

1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:52.581
All routes to China are blocked,

1:08:52.582 --> 1:08:52.927
this fucker is the only quiet way in.

1:08:52.928 --> 1:08:55.389
SKIPPER KIM GYO-BUM

1:08:55.996 --> 1:08:57.377
We're right here.

1:08:57.638 --> 1:08:58.371
Go North.

1:08:58.891 --> 1:09:00.705
Drive around lsan,

1:09:01.051 --> 1:09:03.124
when I give you a signal
lead her down.

1:09:03.644 --> 1:09:06.495
We lose that bitch here,
get the money and ship out.

1:09:06.496 --> 1:09:07.532
Why just the two of us?

1:09:07.792 --> 1:09:08.828
You fuck...

1:09:09.305 --> 1:09:10.988
Don't try to be smart.

1:09:10.989 --> 1:09:13.884
Are you trying to take
the money for yourself?

1:09:13.885 --> 1:09:14.618
Right?

1:09:17.384 --> 1:09:21.056
You will be following the money,
you got some trust issues?

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:24.815
You trust us?

1:09:25.766 --> 1:09:26.802
Do you?

1:09:28.273 --> 1:09:30.086
Were getting Kang today.

1:09:30.606 --> 1:09:33.629
He knows captain and my faces,
so you guys tail him.

1:09:33.630 --> 1:09:34.278
Get off here and check the vicinity.

1:09:36.136 --> 1:09:39.031
Yes, sir.

1:09:40.544 --> 1:09:42.185
Jang is heading out.

1:09:44.692 --> 1:09:47.197
This is fucked up..

1:09:59.686 --> 1:10:00.981
Hop in.

1:10:00.982 --> 1:10:03.487
Put the money in the back,
where I can see it.

1:10:20.339 --> 1:10:22.383
The lady's leaving now with
a driver. No cops around?

1:10:22.932 --> 1:10:24.011
None!

1:10:24.704 --> 1:10:27.165
Move as we planned when they
enter the Central Intersection.

1:10:27.425 --> 1:10:29.758
Just follow my orders,okay?

1:10:30.882 --> 1:10:34.986
He's ordering us around
in the comfort of the hideout.

1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:37.016
He think he's the boss.

1:10:37.579 --> 1:10:38.788
Stay on them.

1:10:54.301 --> 1:10:56.115
- Detective

1:10:57.930 --> 1:10:59.528
Thank you for helping me.

1:11:00.479 --> 1:11:02.292
Uh,yeah...

1:11:05.319 --> 1:11:06.139
Dun worry.

1:11:11.626 --> 1:11:12.231
Eyeballs on the Mercedes.

1:11:13.355 --> 1:11:14.435
Okay.

1:11:15.041 --> 1:11:16.206
Everyone, standby.

1:11:16.251 --> 1:11:18.021
Hong-seok, scan the other cars.

1:11:18.281 --> 1:11:19.879
Sang-hoon, take over

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:20.958
Copy

1:11:21.089 --> 1:11:23.638
Central unit check your surroundings.

1:11:25.886 --> 1:11:27.095
I'm on them.

1:11:35.910 --> 1:11:37.378
What the hell?

1:11:38.158 --> 1:11:39.799
Stay right on their ass.

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:46.280
Boss, we found the derelict factory area.

1:11:46.842 --> 1:11:49.737
The search area is huge,
it will take some time.

1:11:49.997 --> 1:11:52.199
Find Choi as quickly as possible!

1:11:52.373 --> 1:11:53.539
Copy,boss!

1:12:05.681 --> 1:12:06.934
I found the Jang brothers.

1:12:06.935 --> 1:12:09.785
White Avante , 38M1775.

1:12:09.786 --> 1:12:11.082
Is Kang with them?

1:12:11.298 --> 1:12:12.724
No.it's just two of them.

1:12:13.070 --> 1:12:16.440
Damn, where the hell is he?

1:12:19.205 --> 1:12:22.618
200m to Central Intersection,
we're almost there.

1:12:23.095 --> 1:12:24.346
We're close.

1:12:25.471 --> 1:12:28.019
Dun worry,tis my specialty.

1:12:32.428 --> 1:12:34.804
Stay calm, just stay calm.

1:12:36.706 --> 1:12:37.915
Hello?

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.772
You arrived right on time.

1:12:40.032 --> 1:12:40.895
Where are you?

1:12:41.631 --> 1:12:42.710
Make a U-turn.

1:12:42.970 --> 1:12:43.920
What?

1:12:44.267 --> 1:12:46.080
I think that-mail truck
is following us

1:12:46.557 --> 1:12:47.593
Let's begin.

1:12:47.767 --> 1:12:48.414
Slow down.

1:12:53.686 --> 1:12:54.636
Shit,what the hell?

1:12:54.637 --> 1:12:55.889
What do we do?

1:12:57.229 --> 1:12:58.092
Hold on tight.

1:13:01.118 --> 1:13:02.240
He's making a U-turn!

1:13:02.241 --> 1:13:03.018
Should l stay on him?

1:13:03.019 --> 1:13:04.617
No, no, just drive straight!

1:13:08.507 --> 1:13:10.321
Why is he making a U-turn?

1:13:10.322 --> 1:13:11.314
Sang-hoon,just drive! Go!

1:13:11.402 --> 1:13:12.697
Drive away! Go!

1:13:15.075 --> 1:13:16.284
Stay close to her.

1:13:16.544 --> 1:13:18.746
This fucker'ssmoking us out,
I'll get on his tail!

1:13:19.870 --> 1:13:20.906
Let's move

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:23.111
These bastards are
trying to be smart

1:13:23.413 --> 1:13:25.444
Hong-seok,standby
at the intersection.

1:13:26.136 --> 1:13:28.771
Captain, Sang-hoon,
back him up.

1:13:28.772 --> 1:13:29.636
Copy,boss.

1:13:29.938 --> 1:13:30.542
We're on the way!

1:13:41.044 --> 1:13:44.067
How am l supposed to search all of these?

1:13:44.975 --> 1:13:45.623
Have you arrived?

1:13:46.876 --> 1:13:48.388
How many U-turns am l doing?

1:13:48.389 --> 1:13:49.813
Do another one.

1:13:49.814 --> 1:13:51.240
Are you kidding me?

1:13:51.586 --> 1:13:53.097
You don't want to get paid?

1:13:53.574 --> 1:13:56.165
Shut your hole and do what l say.

1:14:06.925 --> 1:14:08.652
Fuck! Turn it around!

1:14:09.561 --> 1:14:10.553
Fucking hell..

1:14:15.048 --> 1:14:16.041
Seok-do, we'll drive straight.

1:14:17.166 --> 1:14:18.547
Sang-hoon, you're up.

1:14:24.338 --> 1:14:25.893
Boss, it’s bad to delay
any more time.

1:14:25.894 --> 1:14:27.880
Were making fourth U-turn already.

1:14:28.486 --> 1:14:28.961
They'll find us out soon.

1:14:30.128 --> 1:14:32.159
Seok-do, let's grab
the brothers first.

1:14:32.419 --> 1:14:34.837
Well take them by surprise,
and cut off their communication,

1:14:34.838 --> 1:14:36.868
and find Choi in the meantime.

1:14:37.042 --> 1:14:39.633
No, we need to secure Choi first.

1:14:39.634 --> 1:14:41.102
Choi is a priority too,

1:14:41.103 --> 1:14:42.615
what if we lose these pricks too?

1:14:42.616 --> 1:14:44.213
No,hostage comes first!

1:14:44.214 --> 1:14:45.423
I don't believe this.

1:14:48.579 --> 1:14:49.874
Damn..

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:07.460
Holy shit!

1:15:12.042 --> 1:15:13.467
Yeah? What about Choi?

1:15:13.468 --> 1:15:15.671
don't see him,
but I'll check the building.

1:15:15.672 --> 1:15:16.881
Call as soon as you find him!

1:15:16.882 --> 1:15:18.004
Roger,boss!

1:15:18.437 --> 1:15:20.207
Cap. Dong-gyun found the Equus!

1:15:20.208 --> 1:15:22.930
He did? Okay got it
I'll go back him up!

1:15:29.455 --> 1:15:32.781
I'm feeling it now.

1:15:35.936 --> 1:15:37.275
This is it.

1:15:38.918 --> 1:15:42.979
Mr. Choi where could you be?

1:15:46.523 --> 1:15:47.601
Shit!

1:15:48.856 --> 1:15:50.238

1:15:51.535 --> 1:15:53.478
Are you all right?

1:15:56.028 --> 1:15:57.324
Can you get up?

1:15:59.917 --> 1:16:01.558
We have to get out,

1:16:03.028 --> 1:16:04.367
You okay?

1:16:04.670 --> 1:16:06.873
Almost there, we're almost there.

1:16:30.380 --> 1:16:32.063
Suspect found, requesting back up!

1:16:32.064 --> 1:16:33.490

Get back here!

1:17:03.607 --> 1:17:05.377
Isn't that Choi Choon-baek?

1:17:09.138 --> 1:17:12.464
Arrest the brothers! We found Choi!

1:17:12.637 --> 1:17:13.587
You found him?!

1:17:13.588 --> 1:17:15.143
Yeah! We got him!

1:17:15.533 --> 1:17:17.519
Good, we'll initiate the op!

1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:19.463
Why didn't you answer my call..

1:17:22.446 --> 1:17:22.964
What’s wrong?

1:17:24.304 --> 1:17:25.211
Dong-gyun!

1:17:25.773 --> 1:17:28.408
What's wrong with you?

1:17:28.409 --> 1:17:30.438
Captain... I'm sorry..

1:17:30.742 --> 1:17:31.778
Shit!

1:17:31.779 --> 1:17:33.593
I let Kang slip through.

1:17:34.674 --> 1:17:35.408
What happened?

1:17:35.409 --> 1:17:37.136
Call the paramedics!
Stay awake!

1:17:37.137 --> 1:17:38.389
What's going on?!

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:40.895
Dong-gyun got stabbed.

1:17:41.199 --> 1:17:42.105
What?!

1:17:42.106 --> 1:17:44.092
Kang stabbed him and fled!

1:17:47.853 --> 1:17:49.148
Fuck

1:17:55.415 --> 1:17:56.580
Where are you?

1:17:56.625 --> 1:17:58.957
How many times do l have to tell you?

1:17:59.303 --> 1:18:02.111
Central lntersection
near LC Department Store.

1:18:02.544 --> 1:18:04.142
Pull out for now,

1:18:04.531 --> 1:18:06.518
What are you saying? Cops?

1:18:07.124 --> 1:18:07.568

1:18:08.118 --> 1:18:09.154

1:18:09.241 --> 1:18:10.191
Forget it

1:18:10.192 --> 1:18:11.530
Return to the motel

1:18:11.531 --> 1:18:14.080

1:18:17.969 --> 1:18:19.351
Jang Ki-chul.

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.116

We got Choi, and now

1:18:43.808 --> 1:18:46.572
Kang fled after stabbing Dong-gyun,
and if we lose those guys,

1:18:46.573 --> 1:18:47.696
we can't get to Kang.

1:18:47.697 --> 1:18:48.431

He's safe, so don't worry.

1:19:09.345 --> 1:19:12.152
Jang Isu, do you see
a white Avante behind you?

1:19:13.103 --> 1:19:13.665

On my cue, block him
at the next intersection

1:19:41.060 --> 1:19:43.046
What if they're really cops?

1:19:43.177 --> 1:19:44.775
Shit,who cares.

1:19:45.035 --> 1:19:46.244

1:24:17.682 --> 1:24:19.063
Fucking bitch.

1:24:31.681 --> 1:24:32.501
Let me through!

1:24:34.533 --> 1:24:35.742
Get over here!

1:24:41.792 --> 1:24:43.346
Where's your fucking driver?!

1:24:43.995 --> 1:24:44.988
Where's my money?

1:24:45.983 --> 1:24:46.976
Where is it?

1:24:48.748 --> 1:24:49.698
Where?!

1:24:51.254 --> 1:24:52.722
Get up,you bitch!

1:24:53.631 --> 1:24:54.796
You fuck!

1:24:54.927 --> 1:24:56.092
Get out of here!

1:24:56.872 --> 1:24:58.729
- Are you okay?
- This way!

1:25:17.741 --> 1:25:19.080
Wanna go back down?

1:25:32.605 --> 1:25:34.073
- One moment!
- Police!

1:25:34.420 --> 1:25:35.542
Out of the way!

1:25:40.901 --> 1:25:41.851
Take that thing away!

1:25:45.569 --> 1:25:46.690
Let’s cleanup.

1:25:53.648 --> 1:25:54.641
Nice!

1:25:56.457 --> 1:25:57.407
Very nice!

1:26:08.555 --> 1:26:09.721
Shit..

1:26:11.882 --> 1:26:13.091
Who the fuck?

1:26:23.592 --> 1:26:25.233
Come on!

1:26:36.728 --> 1:26:37.764
Step on it,go!

1:26:44.290 --> 1:26:45.758
Excuse me! Sir!

1:26:47.315 --> 1:26:48.394
Pardon me..

1:26:55.999 --> 1:26:58.721
Show's over fucking go home!

1:27:18.338 --> 1:27:20.800
This is how a new life starts!

1:27:26.764 --> 1:27:27.670
Boss!

1:27:28.536 --> 1:27:30.349
Jang lsu managed to shake off Kang.

1:27:30.567 --> 1:27:33.460
But Kang stabbed patrols
and is on the run

1:27:34.066 --> 1:27:35.448
Motherfu...

1:27:36.486 --> 1:27:37.825
Send out national APB on Kang.

1:27:37.826 --> 1:27:38.473
Okay

1:27:38.646 --> 1:27:39.467
How's Dong-gyun?

1:27:39.468 --> 1:27:41.195
Captain took him to the hospital.

1:27:42.017 --> 1:27:43.960
Boss, I can't reach Jang Isu.

1:27:43.961 --> 1:27:46.855
He's not answering his cell phone,
I think he took off with the money

1:27:48.152 --> 1:27:51.262
Two suspects involved in
a kidnapping case were arrested.

1:27:51.522 --> 1:27:54.676
The police released an APB
for a suspect who fled

1:27:54.677 --> 1:27:56.534
after stabbing patrol officers.

1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:01.891
They've also issued a warrant
for Korean-Chinese Jang lsu,

1:28:01.892 --> 1:28:02.799
who fled with $2 M ransom.

1:28:04.529 --> 1:28:07.509
They believe that Jang will
smuggle out to China,

1:28:07.510 --> 1:28:09.540
and are canvasing the west sea.

1:28:17.015 --> 1:28:17.965
Fuck..

1:28:22.115 --> 1:28:22.675
Hello?

1:28:22.893 --> 1:28:23.841
One-eye.

1:28:24.103 --> 1:28:25.268
What’s up?

1:28:25.269 --> 1:28:26.737
I need a boat to China.

1:28:27.083 --> 1:28:28.119
Boat to China?

1:28:29.115 --> 1:28:31.144
There aren't any at this time.

1:28:31.145 --> 1:28:33.175
Come on man, do me a favor!

1:28:33.392 --> 1:28:38.403
I'm not Uber, I can't have
a boat on standby for you.

1:28:38.966 --> 1:28:40.650
- Come on!
-I got none

1:28:40.997 --> 1:28:42.119
I'll pay quadruple.

1:28:42.509 --> 1:28:44.323
There is a boat at quadruple.

1:28:45.317 --> 1:28:47.304
But no vacant seat.

1:28:47.521 --> 1:28:51.236
Then I'll pay double of that quadruple, you fuck!

1:28:52.188 --> 1:28:52.921
Where are you?

1:28:53.225 --> 1:28:55.471
I'll send my boy to pick you up.

1:28:56.336 --> 1:28:57.718
Behind the coastal parking lot.

1:28:57.719 --> 1:28:58.928
Okay!

1:29:17.811 --> 1:29:18.932
Are you Jang lsu?

1:29:21.786 --> 1:29:23.383
Did you bring the money?

1:29:24.206 --> 1:29:25.674

1:29:25.934 --> 1:29:27.099

1:29:40.279 --> 1:29:41.099

1:29:44.427 --> 1:29:45.765

1:29:49.180 --> 1:29:52.290

1:30:00.457 --> 1:30:02.271

1:30:05.340 --> 1:30:06.937

1:30:12.211 --> 1:30:13.333

1:30:52.827 --> 1:30:53.473

1:30:53.474 --> 1:30:56.152
No, stay there, stay there.

1:32:37.521 --> 1:32:39.206
This is the police!

1:32:39.552 --> 1:32:43.354
I'm involved in an active case,

1:32:43.528 --> 1:32:45.038
Please get off for a moment.

1:32:46.854 --> 1:32:47.761

- Thank you
- Take care,be careful.

1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:05.261
You're making me sweat
you wanker.

1:33:05.608 --> 1:33:07.853
How did you think about
chasing a bus?

1:33:08.588 --> 1:33:09.755
You're smarter than you look.

1:33:10.144 --> 1:33:11.224
Better than most.

1:33:14.378 --> 1:33:16.970
Why are you on my ass
like a dog in heat?

1:33:18.698 --> 1:33:19.994
Do you need money?

1:33:22.631 --> 1:33:23.753
Do you want a cut?

1:33:29.155 --> 1:33:30.494
Split 50-50?

1:33:32.482 --> 1:33:33.605
Who's 50?

1:33:37.494 --> 1:33:39.437
You're a lost cause.

1:33:39.828 --> 1:33:40.993
Shit!

1:33:42.117 --> 1:33:43.975
You need a good ass whooping.

Your family as well..

1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:41.260
Oh man, what a mess.

1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:00.748

1:37:14.791 --> 1:37:16.735
Ma Seok-do, you punk!

1:37:29.612 --> 1:37:30.907

You got a warrant out for me,
and tell me l did good?

1:37:52.513 --> 1:37:55.753
We got serial numbers for that cash,
once you use it, it'll be tracked.

1:37:55.754 --> 1:37:57.050
I knew it,fuck...

1:38:01.544 --> 1:38:03.141
Son of a bitch!

1:38:07.766 --> 1:38:08.672
What did you say?

1:38:08.674 --> 1:38:10.444
I almost died trying to
get Kang off my back!

1:38:10.445 --> 1:38:12.994
Actually,stowaway out of the country.

1:38:13.859 --> 1:38:14.636

1:38:24.921 --> 1:38:25.957
Stowaway?

1:38:26.259 --> 1:38:28.722
Be honest asshole you were

1:38:29.284 --> 1:38:33.561
Hello? Hello?

1:38:33.649 --> 1:38:35.981
Signal here is bad..

1:38:37.278 --> 1:38:39.524
Hello? Jang Isu!

1:38:41.469 --> 1:38:42.894
Stupid bastard...

1:38:56.419 --> 1:39:00.047
Kang, who murdered 13 people,
has been arrested.

1:39:00.048 --> 1:39:03.807
Kang targeted and murdered
Korean tourists in Southeast Asia,

1:39:03.808 --> 1:39:07.869
and was caught-while trying to flee
after a kidnapping case.

1:39:08.518 --> 1:39:12.189
Choi, Who sought revenge for
the murder of his son,

1:39:12.190 --> 1:39:15.949
hired mecenaries to kill Kang,
and will be tried.

1:39:15.973 --> 1:39:18.045
The police are looking into
sending officers to regions

1:39:20.141 --> 1:39:25.411
where crimes against
Korean nationals are rampant.

1:39:26.104 --> 1:39:28.513
Captain, my car's side mirror
is all busted, do I get anything?

1:39:28.523 --> 1:39:29.214
Mine too!

1:39:29.215 --> 1:39:31.978
Who cares about your car,
I got stabbed big time.

1:39:31.979 --> 1:39:35.262
You got stabbed-with a knife
this big, you crybaby.

1:39:35.522 --> 1:39:37.768
That machete l was stabbed with,

1:39:38.417 --> 1:39:40.015
it was about this long.

1:39:40.016 --> 1:39:44.163

I thought l was a goner.

1:39:44.164 --> 1:39:45.330

1:39:45.331 --> 1:39:47.014

Dude, stop exaggerating!

1:39:49.047 --> 1:39:49.651

1:39:52.114 --> 1:39:54.576
They deserve real beef!

1:39:54.577 --> 1:39:55.829
