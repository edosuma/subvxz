00:01.171 --> 00:06.171
(film roll rattling)
(soft dramatic music)

00:10.062 --> 00:12.550
(soft dramatic music)

00:12.550 --> 00:13.780
- [Rianne] On the first day class,

00:13.780 --> 00:15.930
Professor Rossi walked in and said,

00:15.930 --> 00:17.520
it is completely normal for a man

00:17.520 --> 00:19.800
to come back home from work,
hit the head of his wife

00:19.800 --> 00:22.570
against the kitchen table and kill her.

00:22.570 --> 00:26.167
Remember, we're still the
most dangerous animal.

00:26.167 --> 00:29.334
(soft dramatic music)

00:33.855 --> 00:38.855
(throat clearing)
(soft dramatic music)

00:40.670 --> 00:45.490
- Honey, can you please pick
up your brother on Wednesday?

00:45.490 --> 00:46.930
- How 'bout you send a taxi to get him?

00:46.930 --> 00:48.363
- God, no.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.900
If you don't want to pick him up,

00:51.900 --> 00:53.503
then I will figure out a way.

00:54.950 --> 00:55.783
- No, Mom, it's fine.

00:55.783 --> 00:56.616
I'll pick him up.

00:56.616 --> 00:57.449
It's fine.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.620
I just want you to answer
something for me first.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.453
- What's that?

01:03.930 --> 01:06.720
- Would you visit me twice a
month if I went to prison, too?

01:06.720 --> 01:09.262
- Of course not.

01:09.262 --> 01:11.612
No matter what you did,
they'd never catch you.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.760
- That's not a valid answer.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.063
- It's not the answer that you
wanted, but it is an answer.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.470
Wednesday at 10.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.100
Please don't be late.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.090
- It's not what I asked.

01:25.090 --> 01:28.893
- And please do not get in his case.

01:29.810 --> 01:31.810
Okay, it's the last thing that he needs.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.493
- Sure, promise.

01:46.008 --> 01:47.880
(hand knocking)

01:47.880 --> 01:49.180
- Hey you.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.000
Hey, are you back with us this term?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.630
Wait, did you register with me?

01:52.630 --> 01:53.808
How was vacation?

01:53.808 --> 01:55.358
Did we talk about that already?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.039
- Yes, this is my final term.

01:58.039 --> 02:00.360
Yes, I chose you as my
advisor for my senior project

02:00.360 --> 02:01.950
so I'm already registered.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.320
No, it wasn't a vacation.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.570
It was a leave of absence to
come back with a vengeance.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.000
And no we haven't talked about it already.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.080
Am I interrupting?

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
- Absolutely.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.450
Everybody waited last minute to register.

02:11.450 --> 02:12.283
- Guilty as charged.

02:12.283 --> 02:13.116
Sorry.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.760
Didn't know if I was gonna
be able to afford the time.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.250
- Well, at least you're
one of the good ones,

02:16.250 --> 02:17.860
so I can let it slide.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.870
Anyway, if this is a social visit,

02:19.870 --> 02:20.847
can we reschedule to next week?

02:20.847 --> 02:23.067
'Cause I am really busy.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.530
- Yeah, I actually wanted to talk

02:25.530 --> 02:27.357
to you about my senior project.

02:27.357 --> 02:30.460
- You are making it about
your brother's case, right?

02:30.460 --> 02:32.940
- But Nick is actually getting out soon.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.380
- [Rossi] Already?

02:34.380 --> 02:36.016
- [Rianne] Time flies.

02:36.016 --> 02:37.810
I'm thinking I should just move on

02:37.810 --> 02:39.160
and work on something else.

02:40.571 --> 02:43.190
- Cool your jets, space girl.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.390
How close are you to him?

02:45.390 --> 02:48.180
Because you've been working
on his case for years.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.090
If you push through, you could even write

02:50.090 --> 02:52.430
that book you always talk about.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.963
- It would be too personal.

02:55.662 --> 02:58.002
- Let me be blunt here.

02:58.002 --> 03:03.002
You have never been a normal
person and you never will be.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.200
And yes, I know when I'm
talking about weirdos,

03:05.200 --> 03:07.220
I'm the worst one out there,

03:07.220 --> 03:09.680
but you have to embrace what you're about

03:09.680 --> 03:11.790
and push beyond that.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.053
You know this already.

03:13.908 --> 03:15.440
You have a beautiful mind.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.662
Use it.

03:16.662 --> 03:19.963
Just be the hunter you are meant to be.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.160
- I was talking more about his feelings,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.469
but I guess you kind of have a point.

03:25.469 --> 03:26.569
- Kind of?

03:26.569 --> 03:28.973
You just came here for
the pep talk, didn't you?

03:30.579 --> 03:31.540
Come on, pitch it to me.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.940
Rough is fine.

03:32.940 --> 03:33.773
Just shoot.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.490
- Passion crimes is a
gateway to serial killing.

03:38.490 --> 03:39.870
- Wow, I love it.

03:39.870 --> 03:42.680
Wait, are you saying you think

03:42.680 --> 03:44.840
your brother's gonna kill more people?

03:44.840 --> 03:47.690
- I was thinking of using him
as the passion crimes part.

03:48.642 --> 03:50.043
- I'm sold.

03:50.043 --> 03:52.510
Just iron it up and send me the layout.

03:52.510 --> 03:53.660
- Oh, well now, hold on.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.829
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

03:54.829 --> 03:57.810
I wanna see how things are
with Nick at home first.

03:57.810 --> 04:01.300
- Well, come back when you've
made up your mind, okay.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.133
Bye now.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.433
- Will due.

04:04.433 --> 04:05.700
Thanks.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.250
- A pleasure as always.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.200
- [Rianne] Bye now.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.893
- I guess this is as good a spot as any.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.850
So the big question is-

04:22.850 --> 04:24.347
- Whoa, are you proposing?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.560
No, no, no, no, no.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.393
Don't, don't, don't.

04:26.393 --> 04:27.370
I don't want you to propose.

04:27.370 --> 04:28.203
No.

04:28.203 --> 04:29.550
- I'm just asking you want to eat here.

04:29.550 --> 04:32.550
- Oh, you made it sound like a big moment.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.763
Yes, I am starving.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.253
I don't wanna pick him up.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.490
- Is he really dangerous?

04:45.490 --> 04:47.363
- No, he's just an asshole.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.990
Professor Rossi is right.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.133
This could be my book.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.500
- Boo, you don't even like your brother.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.420
You probably won't see him
again after you graduate.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.368
Do what's best for you.

05:05.368 --> 05:09.705
Nobody cares about your
future as much as you do.

05:09.705 --> 05:12.318
Except me of course.

05:12.318 --> 05:14.420
I just wanna know about your future,

05:14.420 --> 05:16.973
so I can plan around your crazy fantasies.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.447
- Can you imagine how boring
your life would be without me?

05:20.447 --> 05:23.240
You're always so predictable and stable.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.073
- Oh yeah.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.246
I fantasize about it all the time.

05:26.246 --> 05:27.143
- Babe.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.923
- But I wouldn't trade
my boo for anything ever.

05:34.747 --> 05:36.570
- What would I do without you?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.778
- You'd probably just slowly drift away.

05:39.778 --> 05:41.244
- Mm hm.

05:41.244 --> 05:44.411
(soft dramatic music)

06:20.260 --> 06:21.593
Sorry, I'm late.

06:23.866 --> 06:26.676
- What's up with the costume?

06:26.676 --> 06:28.143
- It's not a costume.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.073
- Whatever you say, Marilyn Manson.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.290
- Look, I wanna be left alone.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.230
You wanna be left alone.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.010
Let's just stay out of
each other's way, okay.

06:39.010 --> 06:39.843
- Or else?

06:41.751 --> 06:44.673
- What do you want from me, Nick?

06:44.673 --> 06:47.840
(soft dramatic music)

06:49.180 --> 06:51.570
- I want you help me find Gwen's killer.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.923
- Seriously?

06:52.923 --> 06:53.915
You haven't even been out a day

06:53.915 --> 06:55.350
and that's what's on your mind?

06:55.350 --> 06:56.640
- What else you want me to think about?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.962
Going to a costume party with you?

06:58.962 --> 07:01.180
- Can't you just move on?

07:01.180 --> 07:03.289
- No, I can't just move on.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.560
If you've ever been in
love, then you'd know that.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.260
- Oh, you think you're the first person

07:06.260 --> 07:07.970
to fall in love like ever?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.700
- No, but compared to
you I'm a fucking expert.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.867
- Oh yeah, you were in one
relationship in you're an expert.

07:11.867 --> 07:12.949
- It wasn't one relationship.

07:12.949 --> 07:14.300
It was the relationship.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.920
- [Rianne] Okay, Nick.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.064
- [Nick] So you're gonna help me or not?

07:17.064 --> 07:18.300
- No.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.400
Of course not.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.920
Okay, can't you tell that the entire rest

07:20.920 --> 07:22.263
of the world has moved on?

07:24.330 --> 07:29.003
- You know, Gwen always
tried to include you in it.

07:33.507 --> 07:35.403
- Are you guilt tripping me?

07:37.762 --> 07:38.933
- How can I?

07:38.933 --> 07:40.384
You don't care about anybody.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.280
- Please.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.113
- All right.

07:45.790 --> 07:48.690
Guess just have to do it myself.

07:48.690 --> 07:49.523
- Oh yeah.

07:49.523 --> 07:51.843
And what are you gonna do
when you find him, kill him?

07:56.170 --> 07:59.233
You know, you can't go around
saying things like that.

07:59.233 --> 08:00.683
At least not in front of mom.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.930
- You could pretend to
tolerate me, Rianne,

08:04.930 --> 08:06.873
at least in front of mom.

08:06.873 --> 08:07.763
- I told you.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.370
You leave me alone, I'll leave you alone.

08:10.370 --> 08:11.430
- Fine, let's do that.

08:11.430 --> 08:12.563
- Okay, let's do that.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.960
- He really thought you
weren't gonna leave him a tip.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.793
- I thought about it.

08:25.793 --> 08:28.430
You expect me to behave
like a lady when I'm hungry.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.200
- His face was priceless.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.053
I don't think I can let you do that.

08:33.269 --> 08:35.970
- Maybe he's just from France, babe.

08:35.970 --> 08:38.159
- No way in hell he's French, boo.

08:38.159 --> 08:41.063
His accent changed like
15 times during the meal.

08:46.362 --> 08:47.453
- What is it?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.300
- My mom.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.090
She just drained all the
money from my account.

08:53.090 --> 08:54.797
- I'm sorry, babe.

08:54.797 --> 08:56.630
- It was a matter of time.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.300
She can't say no to him.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.200
- Yeah, but it didn't even take a day.

09:03.941 --> 09:07.868
We're not gonna let this
bring us down, all right?

09:07.868 --> 09:10.563
We'll get through this
just like we always do.

09:11.540 --> 09:15.110
Plus you have me, the hottest, smartest,

09:15.110 --> 09:16.500
bestest girlfriend ever.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.390
- Bestest?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.430
Really, babe?

09:18.430 --> 09:19.540
- You're such a grammar Nazi.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.850
- I'm just saying bestest is not a word.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.330
- Stop, stop.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.127
This is about me supporting you.

09:26.127 --> 09:27.927
Don't you try to change the subject.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.773
Just remember I love you tons.

09:34.820 --> 09:35.653
- [Rianne] Okay.

09:35.653 --> 09:37.310
- Anyway, this cute brain of yours

09:37.310 --> 09:39.760
probably came up with a
plan for this months ago.

09:42.663 --> 09:45.830
(soft dramatic music)

09:54.680 --> 09:56.540
- I understand how you feel,
bro, but what are you gonna do?

09:56.540 --> 09:58.890
Go around and ask if they
killed your girlfriend?

09:58.890 --> 09:59.820
- No.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.630
I'm gonna ask if they know who killed her.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.690
Pay good money for it, too.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.570
- It's only gonna mess with
your head trying to figure out

10:05.570 --> 10:07.950
if the leads they give you are true.

10:07.950 --> 10:08.810
- Well if you have a better idea-

10:08.810 --> 10:10.040
- I do.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.703
Get a job, move on, try to
catch up with your life.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.477
- You know I can't do that, man.

10:18.477 --> 10:20.413
- Well, if you change your mind,

10:21.299 --> 10:23.477
my boss agreed to meet with you.

10:23.477 --> 10:25.500
It's not an interview though.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.453
It's more of a meet and
greet type of thing.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.370
- Thanks, man.

10:29.370 --> 10:30.203
That's cool.

10:30.203 --> 10:31.036
Thanks, man.

10:34.370 --> 10:35.977
Is this the company?

10:35.977 --> 10:38.863
- No, that's a taxi service
I do through the phone.

10:40.890 --> 10:41.820
- Sounds legit.

10:41.820 --> 10:42.653
Does it pay well?

10:42.653 --> 10:43.830
Maybe I can do that.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.344
- Pays all right.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.223
You just wouldn't qualify.

10:48.890 --> 10:49.723
Sorry.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.493
- True.

10:54.630 --> 10:55.710
- [Julian] You wanna see something cool?

10:55.710 --> 10:57.079
- [Nick] Sure.

10:57.079 --> 10:58.483
- [Julian] Check this out.

10:59.620 --> 11:00.453
- [Nick] What's that?

11:00.453 --> 11:01.286
- A camera.

11:04.274 --> 11:06.016
- What do you mean a camera?

11:06.016 --> 11:07.099
No, it's not.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.330
- It's HD, bro.

11:10.330 --> 11:11.981
Sometimes people get rowdy.

11:11.981 --> 11:12.814
- [Nick] What the fuck?

11:12.814 --> 11:13.913
This thing is puny.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.223
- And it's motion activated, right.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.450
Cool or not cool?

11:20.450 --> 11:22.305
- Really fucking cool.

11:22.305 --> 11:23.138
Holy.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.580
Man.

11:30.580 --> 11:31.413
Things change.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.490
- Listen, I know Gwen
was something else but-

11:36.490 --> 11:37.323
- Stop.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.156
- [Julian] You should be open to the idea.

11:38.156 --> 11:38.989
- Stop.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.009
- [Julian] I'm seeing a
super cute girl right now.

11:40.009 --> 11:40.842
- Quit it.

11:40.842 --> 11:42.740
- [Julian] It's not too
serious, but it's really nice

11:42.740 --> 11:44.140
to have someone else around.

11:49.227 --> 11:50.190
- It's gonna take me a second

11:50.190 --> 11:52.033
to start thinking about girls again, man.

11:54.730 --> 11:57.283
- Anyway, I gotta get back to work, man.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.116
- Yeah.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.428
- Just one more thing though.

12:01.428 --> 12:02.261
- What?

12:03.900 --> 12:06.920
- I didn't tell my boss
why you went to prison,

12:06.920 --> 12:09.687
so when you meet with her
just don't go into details.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.339
You know what I mean?

12:11.339 --> 12:14.089
- Yeah, I wasn't planning to but.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.060
Thanks a lot for the hookup, man.

12:17.060 --> 12:18.753
- Yeah, yeah, got you.

12:19.677 --> 12:21.377
You might wanna take care of this.

12:23.090 --> 12:23.923
- Care of what?

12:24.920 --> 12:25.783
- All that.

12:33.130 --> 12:35.000
- Shit, I didn't even think about it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.420
- Yeah bro, you gotta
look good to feel good.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.420
Right now you don't look good at all so.

12:41.780 --> 12:42.613
- Yeah.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.174
Yeah.

12:46.174 --> 12:47.007
Well thanks, man.

12:47.007 --> 12:47.840
- [Julian] Yeah.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.223
- I like this new look, hon.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.147
It suits you.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.840
- It's not like I wasn't gonna clean up

13:03.840 --> 13:05.320
before going to my interviews.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.153
- Wait.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.490
You got an interview already?

13:07.490 --> 13:08.630
- It's like those manifestation books

13:08.630 --> 13:10.130
you gave me always say, right.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.900
- Everything finds its place.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.720
- [Nick] It's finally happening, Mom.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.700
Yeah, yeah.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.073
Better enjoy me while I
still got free time, kid.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.364
- What do you mean?

13:23.364 --> 13:27.055
- Well, I told you that your
brother is staying with us.

13:27.055 --> 13:28.222
- Permanently?

13:29.254 --> 13:30.600
- Why are you defensive?

13:30.600 --> 13:32.800
Didn't I drive you to your
piano lessons every week

13:32.800 --> 13:34.420
when you had to become a virtuoso.

13:34.420 --> 13:37.130
- Yeah, so you could take
the car and screw Gwen.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.570
- Yeah well, what about when I bought

13:38.570 --> 13:39.613
your classmates lunch every Saturday

13:39.613 --> 13:40.980
because you were too much of a nerd

13:40.980 --> 13:41.813
to make your own friends?

13:41.813 --> 13:42.690
- Yeah, every penny Mom gave you,

13:42.690 --> 13:44.740
then you would use it to impress Gwen.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.573
- Well, it worked out, didn't it?

13:45.573 --> 13:46.750
Because she was crazy about me.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.540
- Mm hm, how'd it work out for her?

13:48.540 --> 13:49.440
- Stop it, Rianne.

13:55.970 --> 14:00.970
Anyway, I am very happy
that you're starting

14:01.110 --> 14:02.960
to think about your future already.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.793
- Yeah.

14:05.868 --> 14:07.470
Talking about the future.

14:07.470 --> 14:08.303
I was.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.800
- What is going on?

14:11.800 --> 14:14.680
- I was talking to your
brother about the fact

14:14.680 --> 14:16.690
that you and Mariah spend
so much time together

14:16.690 --> 14:19.333
and you might be moving in with her soon.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.520
- Are you kicking me out?

14:23.520 --> 14:24.580
- No.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.521
We're just planning ahead, that's all.

14:27.521 --> 14:28.460
- What's next?

14:28.460 --> 14:30.488
Selling my organs to pay for his new suit?

14:30.488 --> 14:35.423
- Well Mom did always say that
you eat really healthy so.

14:35.423 --> 14:38.590
(soft dramatic music)

15:09.093 --> 15:10.233
It's okay, kid.

15:11.206 --> 15:14.700
Thought I'd apologize for spazzing out.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.340
- Why are you always such an asshole?

15:17.340 --> 15:19.990
- Oh probably because you're
always such a snowflake.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.253
You moving out?

15:25.534 --> 15:30.293
- Look, I can't help
you with your project,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.603
but this might be a good place to start.

15:37.060 --> 15:37.893
- What's that?

15:40.370 --> 15:41.890
- After the cops left your place,

15:41.890 --> 15:43.300
I took anything that I thought might be

15:43.300 --> 15:44.463
of sentimental value.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.233
- My stuff?

15:50.510 --> 15:51.803
- Mostly Gwen's.

15:52.960 --> 15:53.948
I think.

15:53.948 --> 15:57.115
(soft dramatic music)

15:58.110 --> 15:59.197
- Thanks.

15:59.197 --> 16:02.364
(soft dramatic music)

16:03.640 --> 16:04.618
- Bye.

16:04.618 --> 16:07.785
(soft dramatic music)

16:12.760 --> 16:14.940
I'm making my senior project
on Gwen Anderson's case.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.650
I'm gonna try to fill in
all the missing information

16:16.650 --> 16:17.990
and then make a psychological profile

16:17.990 --> 16:19.933
of the killer to wrap it all up.

16:19.933 --> 16:20.766
- And what is this?

16:20.766 --> 16:22.080
- The research I did three years ago.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.120
It has a timeline of the crime

16:23.120 --> 16:24.360
and a list of all the missing information

16:24.360 --> 16:25.193
for your reference.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.170
By Cameron.

16:26.170 --> 16:27.400
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.980
- Are you saying you
talked to your brother

16:28.980 --> 16:30.788
and he agreed to help you with this?

16:30.788 --> 16:32.033
- Kinda.

16:33.020 --> 16:33.853
- Sit down.

16:36.608 --> 16:37.950
- I have most of the data

16:37.950 --> 16:39.460
from the research I did three years ago.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.190
My brother can help fill
in some of the blanks,

16:41.190 --> 16:42.023
but other than that-

16:42.023 --> 16:43.902
- Blanks that are crucial.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.083
He may even show you where the knife is.

16:46.083 --> 16:46.985
- Well the way I see it,

16:46.985 --> 16:49.370
I don't wanna be overambitious and fail.

16:49.370 --> 16:52.070
- That's the most not Rianne
thing you have ever said.

16:53.710 --> 16:55.810
- Like you said, I can save
the best part for the book

16:55.810 --> 16:57.130
and go into that with more detail

16:57.130 --> 16:59.710
without the deadline of graduation.

16:59.710 --> 17:00.543
- And I like that.

17:00.543 --> 17:02.340
That sounds more like you.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.430
Well just keep me updated

17:03.430 --> 17:05.786
so I know you're not losing perspective.

17:05.786 --> 17:06.762
- Will do.

17:08.599 --> 17:09.433
Bye, Cameron.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.647
- Bye now.

17:11.647 --> 17:14.815
(soft dramatic music)

18:31.874 --> 18:36.565
(phone beeping)
(soft dramatic music)

18:36.565 --> 18:40.274
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

18:40.274 --> 18:41.520
- Yeah, hi.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.813
Is Katie Morrison there?

18:44.550 --> 18:45.626
Sorry, wrong number.

18:45.626 --> 18:46.459
I'm sorry.

18:53.225 --> 18:56.392
(soft dramatic music)

18:58.748 --> 19:03.748
(soft dramatic music)
(keyboard clacking)

19:15.410 --> 19:18.577
(soft dramatic music)

19:34.762 --> 19:39.762
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

19:45.660 --> 19:47.693
Yeah, is Samantha L. there?

19:47.693 --> 19:48.860
Samantha Latt?

19:54.773 --> 19:56.913
- Spit it out, Nick.

19:58.374 --> 19:59.207
- Okay.

20:00.160 --> 20:00.993
I think.

20:02.770 --> 20:07.770
If I just look over her
last few days or weeks,

20:08.220 --> 20:11.590
then I'll probably be
able to find some clue

20:11.590 --> 20:14.090
or some lead or something.

20:14.090 --> 20:17.027
- I told the cops everything.

20:17.027 --> 20:18.653
There's not much left to say.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.450
- I think she was seeing somebody else.

20:26.450 --> 20:30.440
- Well, it's obvious
that whoever killed her

20:30.440 --> 20:32.923
hated her or loved her.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.963
Why else would he have
stabbed her 27 times?

20:38.970 --> 20:41.470
- Well if he knew her,
then he would've come here.

20:42.419 --> 20:45.660
He would've visited
her, checked in on her.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.900
Dropped her off, picked her up.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.623
- I don't know what to tell you.

20:49.586 --> 20:53.630
- Was she acting funny
in the last few days?

20:53.630 --> 20:54.700
Skipping work?

20:54.700 --> 20:55.650
Leaving work early?

21:02.497 --> 21:06.126
You know, Gwen told me a story about you.

21:06.126 --> 21:07.470
Time that you saved that kid

21:07.470 --> 21:09.483
from getting hit at the supermarket.

21:12.332 --> 21:16.307
Then you fractured your
eye socket when he hit you.

21:17.387 --> 21:19.083
And you almost lost that eye.

21:23.460 --> 21:27.090
And I always thought that's somebody

21:27.090 --> 21:28.823
that I want taking care of my kid.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.750
I just always wanted to say that.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.170
Anyways, thanks for seeing me.

21:40.860 --> 21:41.693
- Wait.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.593
Sit down.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.740
I never was comfortable
with their relationship.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.300
However to be fair, they
were very professional

22:01.300 --> 22:02.380
at least until the end.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.463
- What do you mean?

22:04.320 --> 22:05.820
- Well, she had a friend here.

22:06.930 --> 22:08.390
About a month before she was killed,

22:08.390 --> 22:10.053
they had a falling out.

22:13.180 --> 22:15.363
Never thought much about it until now.

22:16.230 --> 22:19.020
- You didn't tell the cops this because?

22:19.020 --> 22:24.020
- The cops talked to him, but
it was different back then.

22:29.746 --> 22:32.623
- And when you said that you didn't

22:32.623 --> 22:35.580
have anything else to tell me?

22:35.580 --> 22:38.363
- I knew it was much more
complicated than it seemed.

22:42.246 --> 22:44.890
I think about it sometimes,

22:44.890 --> 22:48.540
but I just always felt
I shouldn't get involved

22:48.540 --> 22:50.363
without knowing all the facts.

22:55.070 --> 22:59.313
Gwen liked to talk and he liked to listen.

23:05.100 --> 23:10.063
Maybe he remembers if she
was going through something.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.023
- Cameron?

23:12.023 --> 23:14.730
- Yeah, he was devastated
when he found out.

23:14.730 --> 23:15.900
- Cameron who?

23:15.900 --> 23:17.350
What's his last name?

23:17.350 --> 23:18.183
- Porter.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.820
- Samantha.

23:20.820 --> 23:21.653
Thank you.

23:22.786 --> 23:24.708
Thank you very much.

23:24.708 --> 23:27.875
(soft dramatic music)

23:48.940 --> 23:50.340
You knew I didn't kill Gwen.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.060
- What?

23:53.060 --> 23:54.450
- And yet you didn't bother to look

23:54.450 --> 23:56.690
at any of the things
that you put in the box.

23:56.690 --> 23:58.353
- Those were personal things.

24:00.850 --> 24:01.700
- You have a beautiful mind.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.820
Use it.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.220
Mr. P.

24:05.220 --> 24:06.830
- Who's Mr. P.?

24:06.830 --> 24:10.450
- Mr. Porter was our math
teacher in middle school.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.130
You know that cool teacher

24:12.130 --> 24:13.970
everybody wanted to be friends with?

24:13.970 --> 24:17.150
- And he gave that book to Gwen?

24:17.150 --> 24:19.760
- In eighth grade just a few years

24:19.760 --> 24:22.550
before they worked
together at the orphanage.

24:22.550 --> 24:23.999
- That's creepy.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.630
If you're going where
I think you're going.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.880
- Yeah, it seems like
they were pretty close.

24:30.360 --> 24:34.823
This card was also in the box.

24:43.130 --> 24:43.963
- Wait a minute.

24:43.963 --> 24:44.941
You think the same guy-

24:44.941 --> 24:46.220
- Honestly, I'm just all over
the fucking place right now.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.970
I could really use a cool
head to help me see straight.

24:53.799 --> 24:54.653
- Okay.

24:54.653 --> 24:56.153
Can you move back?

24:57.040 --> 24:58.510
Look, we need to organize ourselves

24:58.510 --> 25:00.310
before making contact with him.

25:00.310 --> 25:01.930
Make a timeline of where

25:01.930 --> 25:03.700
and how often he was contact with Gwen.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.500
That way we can anticipate
any alibi he might have

25:06.500 --> 25:07.340
and stay ahead of him.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.670
- Okay, why not just confront him?

25:08.670 --> 25:09.503
- No.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.660
If he knows that we're onto him,

25:13.660 --> 25:16.070
he could destroy any
link he has to the case.

25:16.070 --> 25:17.620
I mean, he may have kept
the knife as a trophy,

25:17.620 --> 25:19.470
so we should try and find that first.

25:23.890 --> 25:24.723
Nick.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.030
It's imperative that we
do not reach out to him

25:28.030 --> 25:30.173
until we know as much as we can, okay.

25:32.680 --> 25:33.513
I mean it.

25:33.513 --> 25:35.450
Don't contact him until we're both ready.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.711
- Heard you the first
time, kid, all right.

25:37.711 --> 25:39.860
This is what he looks like, by the way.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.713
He's a real dapper dresser.

25:42.889 --> 25:43.722
What are you thinking?

25:43.722 --> 25:45.717
What?

25:45.717 --> 25:47.873
- We should be very careful.

25:50.030 --> 25:51.330
- Hey.

25:51.330 --> 25:53.240
- What does the P stand for?

25:53.240 --> 25:54.073
- What?

25:57.330 --> 25:59.910
- What does the P stand for?

25:59.910 --> 26:01.750
What's your middle name?

26:01.750 --> 26:04.344
- The P stands for Porter
which is my last name

26:04.344 --> 26:06.640
and my middle name is something else,

26:06.640 --> 26:09.483
which I will never tell
you or anyone else.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.030
- I thought your last name was Rossi.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.570
- Well that's my second last name.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.230
I'm Hispanic, remember?

26:16.230 --> 26:17.920
People around here kept using Rossi,

26:17.920 --> 26:20.600
so I stopped trying to explain it to them.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.921
Anyway, what do you need?

26:22.921 --> 26:25.691
(soft dramatic music)

26:25.691 --> 26:27.893
- [Rianne] We found a suspect.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.856
- Wait, what do you mean?

26:31.856 --> 26:33.480
Are you saying Nick didn't do it?

26:33.480 --> 26:35.020
- First of all, all the evidence they had

26:35.020 --> 26:36.470
on Nick was circumstantial.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.990
And second of all, we found out that Gwen

26:38.990 --> 26:41.910
had a falling out with a
coworker that she was close with.

26:43.175 --> 26:44.460
- Go on.

26:44.460 --> 26:45.650
- You know, it actually seems

26:45.650 --> 26:47.493
like they knew each other for years.

26:50.416 --> 26:52.760
And if that's true, imagine this.

26:53.650 --> 26:57.990
Imagine that you are that guy
and you've been seeing Gwen

26:57.990 --> 27:00.680
and you're totally invested in her.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.663
She's the love of your life and then boom.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.696
You find out that she'll
leave you for her boyfriend,

27:08.696 --> 27:10.787
which means you're the disposable one.

27:11.794 --> 27:13.877
That would be the motive.

27:15.326 --> 27:16.493
- But what if?

27:17.425 --> 27:19.950
What if it was the other way around?

27:19.950 --> 27:22.030
What if this guy was Gwen's real partner

27:22.030 --> 27:25.920
and it was Nick the one who
lost it when he found out?

27:25.920 --> 27:27.630
I mean, we know Gwen
was seeing other people.

27:27.630 --> 27:29.430
Why would this one be any different?

27:30.330 --> 27:32.138
- This one loved her.

27:32.138 --> 27:34.570
- And the others didn't?

27:34.570 --> 27:36.463
- The others were too young.

27:37.370 --> 27:40.523
This one was a real
man hopelessly in love.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.230
- How do you know Nick's not using you

27:43.230 --> 27:45.260
to blame someone else?

27:45.260 --> 27:46.600
- Nick, no.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.280
Doesn't have it in him.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.923
- We all think it's not in us.

27:51.119 --> 27:53.810
That's what's so fascinating
about passion crimes.

27:53.810 --> 27:56.350
Everybody is a suspect.

27:56.350 --> 27:57.920
What else?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.423
- That's it for now.

28:00.950 --> 28:04.433
- Well, if Nick didn't do it,
we need to find out who did.

28:05.420 --> 28:06.510
Keep going.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.610
You're onto something.

28:09.850 --> 28:10.683
Wait.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.290
Did you ever find out what
happened to Katie Morrison?

28:15.290 --> 28:16.200
- No.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.390
Why?

28:17.390 --> 28:18.670
- I always thought it was strange

28:18.670 --> 28:20.740
she went missing right after.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.821
I mean, if Nick didn't kill Gwen,

28:22.821 --> 28:25.270
wouldn't Katie be the next suspect?

28:25.270 --> 28:27.476
- I don't have anything on her.

28:27.476 --> 28:30.643
(soft dramatic music)

29:08.300 --> 29:09.550
- Hi, I'm Mariah.

29:09.550 --> 29:10.550
I'm Rianne's friend.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.650
- Nick, but you probably
know about me, right.

29:14.650 --> 29:16.026
- A thing or two.

29:16.026 --> 29:19.419
- Rianne hasn't told me a thing about you,

29:19.419 --> 29:23.010
but we can all clearly see
that you make her very happy,

29:23.010 --> 29:24.600
which is surprising really.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.420
- She likes perfection.

29:26.420 --> 29:27.380
What can I say?

29:27.380 --> 29:28.540
- Yeah, well it's nice to that yeah,

29:28.540 --> 29:30.890
she found some sugar for her coffee.

29:30.890 --> 29:32.790
- Is that an innuendo?

29:32.790 --> 29:33.623
- No, no, no, no.

29:33.623 --> 29:35.203
Like.

29:35.203 --> 29:37.550
You're like the sweet part of her life.

29:37.550 --> 29:38.740
- I'm just messing with you.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.450
I know what you meant.

29:40.450 --> 29:41.660
- Oh.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.493
Sorry.

29:42.493 --> 29:45.293
She can be pretty extreme so.

29:45.293 --> 29:46.726
- Oh, I would know, trust me.

29:46.726 --> 29:47.559
- Yeah?

29:47.559 --> 29:49.062
You think you know her well?

29:49.062 --> 29:50.213
- You think you know her better?

29:50.213 --> 29:51.247
- I mean, well you know about the time

29:52.210 --> 29:56.730
that she sprained her ankle
while playing hooky, right?

29:56.730 --> 29:57.563
Or what about the time

29:57.563 --> 29:58.640
that she went skinny
dipping at public point?

29:58.640 --> 29:59.473
Know about that?

29:59.473 --> 30:00.670
- Skinny dipping?

30:00.670 --> 30:05.400
- This girl runs into the city
pool butt ass fucking naked.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.770
Okay, can you imagine that?

30:06.770 --> 30:07.603
- No freaking way.

30:07.603 --> 30:08.644
She would never do that.

30:08.644 --> 30:11.080
- I couldn't find my swimsuit
because this jerk hid it.

30:11.080 --> 30:11.913
- Oh.

30:11.913 --> 30:14.000
Dude, she didn't care about that, okay.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.740
She runs out.

30:15.740 --> 30:17.410
Just stripped.

30:17.410 --> 30:18.711
She was really skinny back then, too,

30:18.711 --> 30:20.030
so she was running like a
little stick figure, you know.

30:20.030 --> 30:20.863
Like an old cartoon.

30:20.863 --> 30:21.858
Like she runs in.

30:21.858 --> 30:22.960
She couldn't swim either.

30:22.960 --> 30:23.870
She was like kneeing in the noodle.

30:23.870 --> 30:25.560
She was like ah splish splash.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.490
Ah.

30:26.490 --> 30:27.630
- You're full of crap.

30:27.630 --> 30:28.720
- [Nick] I am dead serious.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.553
Ask her.
- I'm ready.

30:29.553 --> 30:30.500
Lets go.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.130
- It was fun meeting you.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.050
- Nice to meet you, too.

30:34.050 --> 30:34.883
See ya.

30:34.883 --> 30:35.966
- [Nick] Bye.

30:43.973 --> 30:45.663
- Want more ice cream, boo?

30:45.663 --> 30:47.033
- No thanks, babe.

30:49.650 --> 30:52.043
- Are you annoyed that I
talked to your brother?

30:52.920 --> 30:55.213
- No, I'm annoyed that
you keep bringing it up.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.440
- Okay, got it.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.770
- Why does he think he's so smart?

31:02.770 --> 31:04.833
- I think he's just trying to compensate.

31:04.833 --> 31:07.277
- Compensate for what?

31:07.277 --> 31:10.320
- I don't know, everything.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.170
- He's smart, funny, handsome,

31:12.170 --> 31:14.030
and even my gay girlfriend
thinks he's a catch.

31:14.030 --> 31:14.863
What more does he want?

31:14.863 --> 31:17.810
- You know that's not how it works.

31:17.810 --> 31:19.350
He's just afraid.

31:19.350 --> 31:21.050
- Afraid of what?

31:21.050 --> 31:22.844
- Of you, boo.

31:22.844 --> 31:25.700
You're like a walking brain
always analyzing everything

31:25.700 --> 31:28.820
and absorbing information and finding out

31:28.820 --> 31:31.043
all the right answers at the same time.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.150
As annoying as it sounds,
I know I can call you up

31:35.150 --> 31:36.450
because you're always right.

31:36.450 --> 31:38.933
- Is that what you think of me?

31:38.933 --> 31:40.683
That I'm a walking computer?

31:43.150 --> 31:43.983
- I'm sorry, boo.

31:43.983 --> 31:45.943
I shouldn't get involved between you two.

31:46.850 --> 31:48.130
- Oh, no.

31:48.130 --> 31:50.280
It's too late to be sorry.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.040
Now you're gonna have to make it up to me.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.600
- You're so manipulative sometimes.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.253
What do I have to do?

31:57.253 --> 31:59.070
- Can you get me some more ice cream?

31:59.070 --> 32:00.820
- You just said you didn't.

32:03.194 --> 32:05.383
What flavor do you want?

32:05.383 --> 32:08.550
(soft dramatic music)

32:44.290 --> 32:45.470
- Looking sharp.

32:45.470 --> 32:46.810
- How long you fucking Gwen?

32:46.810 --> 32:48.130
- What?

32:48.130 --> 32:50.271
- You fuck her the day she died?

32:50.271 --> 32:52.940
- Yo man, you're really freaking me out.

32:52.940 --> 32:54.410
- You fucking piece of shit.

32:54.410 --> 32:55.243
- Hey, man.

32:55.243 --> 32:56.076
Hey, you should've told her.

32:56.076 --> 32:57.870
You should've told her that, man.

32:57.870 --> 32:58.703
You get in my face.

32:58.703 --> 33:00.420
Never forced her to do anything.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.530
She liked being with
dudes since high school.

33:02.530 --> 33:04.169
Everybody knew that.

33:04.169 --> 33:05.170
- She liked attention.

33:05.170 --> 33:06.003
That doesn't mean you get

33:06.003 --> 33:07.230
to take advantage of her like that, man.

33:07.230 --> 33:08.370
- Nobody took advantage of her.

33:08.370 --> 33:10.560
She's a grown ass woman.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.883
- She was a fucking kid.

33:13.378 --> 33:15.150
All right, she couldn't say no, you idiot.

33:15.150 --> 33:17.377
- Nick, that's who she was.

33:18.350 --> 33:19.570
She liked getting it on.

33:19.570 --> 33:21.040
She liked the attention.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.640
There's nothing wrong with that.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.433
- Who else?

33:29.110 --> 33:30.610
- Everybody.

33:30.610 --> 33:31.443
She was hot.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.470
Who would say no to her?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.290
Look, I know deep down inside,
you're not surprised at all.

33:37.290 --> 33:39.333
You have to understand it
had nothing to do with you.

33:41.070 --> 33:43.308
Look, for what it's worth,

33:43.308 --> 33:45.823
I still hear her laughter all the time.

33:46.830 --> 33:47.990
I loved her, too, man.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.473
I just wasn't fool enough to
think that I could own her.

33:51.870 --> 33:52.970
- Go fuck yourself.

33:52.970 --> 33:53.803
- Go cool off.

33:53.803 --> 33:55.728
- Go fuck yourself.

33:55.728 --> 33:58.895
(soft dramatic music)

34:02.200 --> 34:03.350
When you say everybody.

34:07.329 --> 34:08.329
- Everybody.

34:09.373 --> 34:11.572
Nobody talked about it
but it wasn't a secret.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.263
Sorry man.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.429
(soft dramatic music)

35:10.160 --> 35:13.743
(dramatic music continues)

35:45.670 --> 35:50.670
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

35:51.060 --> 35:52.700
- Mr. Porter.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.470
Mr. Porter, I don't
know if you remember me.

35:55.470 --> 35:57.313
My name is Nick Angers.

36:01.807 --> 36:02.640
We have to talk.

36:18.880 --> 36:22.050
- Would you like to sit down
or would you rather walk?

36:22.050 --> 36:24.200
I prefer if we sit here
if I can be honest.

36:37.407 --> 36:39.913
- Did you kill her
because she preferred me?

36:41.290 --> 36:42.450
- Funny.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.010
That was gonna be my line.

36:44.010 --> 36:46.053
But it turns out, you didn't do it.

36:47.098 --> 36:48.633
Do you have any leads?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.920
- What bothers me the most
is that you don't even try

36:51.920 --> 36:54.303
to deny that you groomed
her since like that what?

36:54.303 --> 36:56.150
Middle school?

36:56.150 --> 36:57.680
- The cats out of the bag already.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.670
I mean, are you really gonna judge me

36:59.670 --> 37:01.230
for liking the same girl you

37:01.230 --> 37:03.510
and the whole damn school had a crush on?

37:03.510 --> 37:04.890
- She could've been your daughter.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.710
- But she wasn't.

37:06.710 --> 37:09.240
And I loved her in ways
you can't even imagine yet

37:09.240 --> 37:11.043
because you're young and stupid.

37:12.090 --> 37:14.470
She enjoyed my company.

37:14.470 --> 37:15.840
Can you say the same?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.847
- Apparently a lot of people can.

37:17.847 --> 37:18.743
- Not really.

37:23.380 --> 37:27.480
- I think she dumped you
and you fucking lost it.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.433
- I hated you so much back then.

37:31.430 --> 37:34.610
But now, I just feel bad for you.

37:34.610 --> 37:35.810
You lost everything.

37:35.810 --> 37:38.713
Gwen, your freedom, your future.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.667
- Gotta roll with the punches, man.

37:43.950 --> 37:46.140
- We want the same thing, Nick.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.940
We need to work together if
we're gonna find our killer.

37:51.408 --> 37:52.900
- All right.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.703
What do you know?

37:55.673 --> 37:59.210
- Well that last year, she
was experimenting a lot.

37:59.210 --> 38:02.720
Started liking girls,
but it wasn't enough.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.036
- Yeah, she wanted kids.

38:06.036 --> 38:08.782
- I thought she was too young.

38:08.782 --> 38:10.323
- I told her I was too young.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.510
- That's why I think
the killer was a girl.

38:15.630 --> 38:18.300
Gwen was probably actively
trying to get pregnant

38:18.300 --> 38:20.350
and when the girl found out, she lost it.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.630
- Okay, what makes you say that?

38:23.630 --> 38:25.440
- The guys Gwen got with were trash.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.640
Her girl must've been offended.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.140
When she found out Gwen wanted one

38:29.140 --> 38:32.483
of these guys to knock
her up, that was it.

38:35.798 --> 38:37.800
- You know, Gwen was with a lot of people.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.290
I think anybody could've done it.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.860
- Not anybody.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.360
Only one who really loved her.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.670
- Well that brings it
back to you, doesn't it?

38:47.670 --> 38:48.503
Apparently.

38:51.820 --> 38:53.253
- What about Katie Morrison?

38:55.070 --> 38:55.970
They were an item.

38:57.730 --> 39:02.640
- I could see that, but
Katie's not the violent type.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.373
- Anybody can be the violent type.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.100
But what do we have to lose?

39:08.100 --> 39:10.113
Let's find her and ask her.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.630
- I never said I trusted you, man.

39:16.917 --> 39:19.400
- You know, the way I look at it is this.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.000
You haven't killed me because either A,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.853
you don't have it in you, or
B, you think I didn't do it.

39:27.619 --> 39:29.702
- The answer's B for now.

39:33.307 --> 39:34.973
- I'm gonna go with C.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.767
All of the above.

39:38.764 --> 39:41.931
(soft dramatic music)

40:23.860 --> 40:25.320
- What?

40:25.320 --> 40:27.290
You waiting for me to apologize

40:27.290 --> 40:30.797
for calling you out on something you did?

40:30.797 --> 40:32.983
- You could've texted me
saying that you were coming.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.390
My girl's sleeping.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.810
Did I tell you I managed to
set up your meeting for Monday?

40:42.810 --> 40:43.810
- The job interview?

40:45.660 --> 40:46.493
Wait, dude.

40:46.493 --> 40:47.326
It is Saturday.

40:47.326 --> 40:49.197
When the fuck were you gonna tell me?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.043
- I just did.

40:50.940 --> 40:51.903
- Gee, thanks.

40:53.950 --> 40:54.783
You busy?

40:56.386 --> 40:57.886
Need your help with something.

40:58.880 --> 40:59.723
- With what?

41:01.210 --> 41:02.398
- I gotta go talk to somebody.

41:02.398 --> 41:03.698
I don't wanna do it alone.

41:05.580 --> 41:06.940
- Are you for real?

41:06.940 --> 41:08.820
Are we in some kind of trouble?

41:08.820 --> 41:09.653
- Probably.

41:12.068 --> 41:12.901
- Dammit, Nick.

41:12.901 --> 41:14.692
Why you always try to get me involved?

41:14.692 --> 41:16.213
- You're the only friend I have, man.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.540
It's not like you have any
special skills or anything so.

41:21.540 --> 41:22.403
- Fuck you.

41:24.830 --> 41:25.937
Where we going?

41:25.937 --> 41:28.604
(ominous music)

41:36.120 --> 41:38.406
Do I need to look tough like
I'm about to beat him up?

41:38.406 --> 41:40.510
- Man, just you know, watch my back.

41:44.324 --> 41:46.890
- I don't think he can hear that.

41:46.890 --> 41:47.723
- He's out.

41:47.723 --> 41:48.693
I'm just checking.

41:52.050 --> 41:52.883
For hair.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.876
- Gotta be kidding me.

41:58.876 --> 42:01.543
(ominous music)

42:33.601 --> 42:35.031
- I just wanna talk to him.

42:35.031 --> 42:37.307
I don't wanna go alone.

42:37.307 --> 42:40.593
- Man, help me look so we
can get out of here faster.

42:41.648 --> 42:44.140
- What are we looking for?

42:44.140 --> 42:46.320
- A knife or anything related to Gwen.

42:47.205 --> 42:50.205
(suspenseful music)

43:37.474 --> 43:38.870
- Do you remember Ryan Root?

43:38.870 --> 43:40.723
Lanky guy from high school?

43:42.430 --> 43:43.363
- Rings a bell.

43:45.150 --> 43:46.273
- Quite bit of a jerk.

43:48.150 --> 43:50.250
He got better and kept in touch.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.013
- Julian, what does this
have to do with anything?

43:52.920 --> 43:54.397
- He went missing.

43:54.397 --> 43:57.397
(suspenseful music)

44:06.780 --> 44:08.580
We should read that somewhere else.

44:08.580 --> 44:11.580
(suspenseful music)

44:21.600 --> 44:22.450
- Hey, I looked at the list

44:22.450 --> 44:23.748
of names you told me and they say-

44:23.748 --> 44:25.310
- Missing.

44:25.310 --> 44:27.860
- Why'd you make me look
it up if you already knew?

44:29.050 --> 44:29.900
- Just found out.

44:31.967 --> 44:33.710
- Where did you find this?

44:33.710 --> 44:34.760
- Mr. Porter's trash.

44:35.661 --> 44:36.494
What?

44:36.494 --> 44:38.072
His door was open.

44:38.072 --> 44:41.072
(suspenseful music)

44:57.880 --> 45:00.460
- These files are very detailed.

45:00.460 --> 45:02.213
- Yeah, he likes doing his homework.

45:03.490 --> 45:04.351
- Nick.

45:04.351 --> 45:06.020
Nick, these are his trophies.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.890
He's gonna notice that somebody took them.

45:07.890 --> 45:08.760
- Done.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.443
Let's just see what we can find.

45:11.591 --> 45:14.591
(suspenseful music)

45:19.820 --> 45:21.593
- Everyone that loved her died.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.350
- Just to cover all the bases.

45:24.350 --> 45:25.183
- What?

45:27.020 --> 45:28.931
- Julian was fucking Gwen.

45:28.931 --> 45:30.931
Julian was fucking Gwen.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.340
- Your friend Julian?

45:35.340 --> 45:36.560
- Yeah.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.061
Julian Hansen.

45:38.061 --> 45:41.061
(suspenseful music)

45:42.820 --> 45:44.743
His name's not in any
of Mr. Porter's files

45:44.743 --> 45:47.073
and he wasn't in any of the
police reports either so.

45:49.434 --> 45:51.203
- How did you find this out?

45:51.203 --> 45:52.743
I mean, did he tell you?

45:53.640 --> 45:54.630
- Don't worry about it, kid.

45:54.630 --> 45:55.493
I got my ways.

45:58.460 --> 45:59.293
- Okay well.

46:00.330 --> 46:01.670
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

46:01.670 --> 46:03.640
So far Mr. Porter is
still our main suspect.

46:03.640 --> 46:06.124
Don't tell anything else to Julian.

46:06.124 --> 46:07.593
- Hey, you know Katie Morrison?

46:09.490 --> 46:10.387
- What about her?

46:11.355 --> 46:12.911
- I mean, she was Gwen's best friend.

46:12.911 --> 46:13.744
You know-

46:13.744 --> 46:14.977
- She's missing, too.

46:14.977 --> 46:17.977
(suspenseful music)

46:19.100 --> 46:21.618
- She disappeared two months
after Gwen got killed.

46:21.618 --> 46:22.451
- Yeah.

46:22.451 --> 46:23.990
And everybody else went missing

46:23.990 --> 46:26.370
within a six month period three years ago.

46:26.370 --> 46:28.030
- So Porter killed them.

46:28.030 --> 46:29.640
- Yeah, there are two types of killers

46:29.640 --> 46:30.540
that leave a body behind.

46:30.540 --> 46:33.083
The ones that wanna make a
statement and the stupid ones.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.585
This one didn't wanna leave a trace.

46:35.585 --> 46:36.769
- Yeah, Porter disappeared-

46:36.769 --> 46:39.670
- He kept the flyers as trophies

46:39.670 --> 46:40.910
because they're not real evidence.

46:40.910 --> 46:43.523
- That still leaves Julian and Katie.

46:45.209 --> 46:46.623
- Then Katie is in hiding?

46:49.440 --> 46:52.083
- I think Katie could be Gwen's killer.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.370
- Okay, stop it.

46:54.370 --> 46:56.200
You're starting to lose perspective here.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.700
Yeah, Katie is a loose end, true,

46:57.700 --> 47:00.270
but everything else points to Mr. Porter.

47:00.270 --> 47:01.230
I mean, look.

47:01.230 --> 47:03.021
He probably tracked down all the people,

47:03.021 --> 47:04.850
all the guys that were close to Gwen

47:04.850 --> 47:08.260
and well, now they're missing.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.390
- Look man, I don't know.

47:10.390 --> 47:13.746
Anyway you slice it, I just
don't see Porter killing Gwen.

47:13.746 --> 47:16.746
(suspenseful music)

47:18.512 --> 47:21.179
- You talked to him, didn't you?

47:22.947 --> 47:24.170
- It was the only lead that we had.

47:24.170 --> 47:26.480
- Dammit, Nick, and
now he got in your head

47:26.480 --> 47:27.650
and you're sympathizing with him

47:27.650 --> 47:29.800
and you can't see things objectively.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.030
- Porter may have killed these guys.

47:31.030 --> 47:32.280
Yeah okay, sure.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.560
Fuck it, fine.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.763
I just do not think that he killed Gwen.

47:35.763 --> 47:37.213
I think somebody else did it.

47:38.070 --> 47:39.143
- Don't think so.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.463
- Well then, see what else
you can find about Katie.

47:50.098 --> 47:51.622
- I'll do it tomorrow.

47:51.622 --> 47:53.037
I'm on my way out.

48:02.481 --> 48:06.731
- I'm not sure why we go
out when you're in a mood.

48:08.270 --> 48:09.660
- Please don't start, babe.

48:09.660 --> 48:12.934
With work and school and
Nick, I have a lot on my plate

48:12.934 --> 48:15.020
and it's giving me a lot of anxiety.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.420
- Tell you what.

48:16.420 --> 48:18.220
I'm gonna give you a nice, little massage,

48:18.220 --> 48:20.223
help you relax, and then we're gonna see

48:20.223 --> 48:22.193
if you're feeling a little sexy later.

48:23.940 --> 48:25.890
- And you say I'm the manipulative one.

48:36.380 --> 48:38.510
- Nick is not like how
I imagined him at all.

48:38.510 --> 48:39.850
He seems pretty down to earth.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.130
- Babe.

48:41.130 --> 48:43.040
- When you think about
it, he could be the hero

48:43.040 --> 48:46.240
that comes back from prison
and avenges his girlfriend.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.919
Like the movie "The Crow", remember?

48:49.919 --> 48:51.680
- First of all, the guy from "The Crow"

48:51.680 --> 48:52.750
comes back from the dead.

48:52.750 --> 48:54.810
And second of all, Nick does not qualify

48:54.810 --> 48:55.920
as any kind of hero.

48:55.920 --> 48:58.080
He's never had any long term goals.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.860
- He seems pretty determined to find out

48:59.860 --> 49:01.970
what happened to his girl.

49:01.970 --> 49:02.803
- Oh yeah?

49:02.803 --> 49:04.240
Did you guys talk about that?

49:04.240 --> 49:05.570
- No.

49:05.570 --> 49:08.530
He said that apparently
it'll make you happy.

49:08.530 --> 49:09.940
- How would he know?

49:09.940 --> 49:10.853
- Really, babe?

49:11.961 --> 49:12.794
- I'm just saying.

49:12.794 --> 49:14.120
It's not like I tell him things like that.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.480
It's personal.

49:15.480 --> 49:16.600
- Are you upset?

49:16.600 --> 49:18.020
- No.

49:18.020 --> 49:18.853
Maybe.

49:18.853 --> 49:20.133
You like him too much.

49:23.380 --> 49:24.830
- I'm not Gwen, okay.

49:24.830 --> 49:26.477
I won't betray you like she did.

49:28.780 --> 49:29.680
- How do you know?

49:31.037 --> 49:33.787
- Has anyone ever told you
that you might be psychotic?

49:35.600 --> 49:38.640
- Is that your professional
opinion, Dr. Lee?

49:38.640 --> 49:40.690
- Well, that's just a theory.

49:40.690 --> 49:42.560
So far you haven't shown disregard

49:42.560 --> 49:45.610
for morality so that's a plus,

49:45.610 --> 49:49.783
but you also don't seem to be
very empathetic towards anyone

49:50.665 --> 49:53.313
so that makes me wonder sometimes.

49:54.550 --> 49:56.000
- You know what I'm thinking?

49:57.020 --> 49:58.610
- Is that when you decide work means

49:58.610 --> 50:00.810
more fun than hanging with me?

50:00.810 --> 50:03.700
- Not all psychopaths are serial killers.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.745
They might just need one less
justification to become one.

50:06.745 --> 50:07.870
Imagine this.

50:07.870 --> 50:11.490
Imagine you have functional
psychopath, a high achiever,

50:11.490 --> 50:13.510
and for some reason they kill somebody.

50:13.510 --> 50:14.910
- A passion crime?

50:14.910 --> 50:16.790
- I was thinking more
self defense but yeah.

50:16.790 --> 50:18.140
A passion crime works, too.

50:19.090 --> 50:20.650
And there are no consequences.

50:20.650 --> 50:23.150
They kill someone and
nothing happens to them.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.460
- That would confirm the idea

50:24.460 --> 50:26.340
that they're involved in society.

50:26.340 --> 50:28.263
- Right and justify their behavior.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.170
- Nick is very charming,
so I wouldn't be surprised.

50:31.170 --> 50:33.310
- No, I was actually talking
about Professor Rossi.

50:33.310 --> 50:34.860
Can we leave Nick out of this?

50:34.860 --> 50:37.407
Honestly, can we just leave
him out of everything?

50:37.407 --> 50:42.370
- Or we can just stop talking at all?

50:42.370 --> 50:43.203
- Stop.

50:43.203 --> 50:45.280
Okay, I should be focusing

50:45.280 --> 50:48.020
on Professor Rossi instead of Nick.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.173
- And we lost her.

50:50.230 --> 50:52.880
- This is the premise
I needed for my book.

50:52.880 --> 50:56.040
Passion crimes is the
ongoing obsession of love.

50:56.040 --> 50:57.400
- Night, boo.

50:57.400 --> 51:01.000
Don't forget to tuck me
in when you go to sleep.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.113
Before I pass out,

51:06.810 --> 51:07.770
I love you tons.

51:08.952 --> 51:09.785
- Okay.

51:10.727 --> 51:13.894
(soft dramatic music)

52:10.991 --> 52:14.574
(dramatic music continues)

52:33.202 --> 52:36.023
(phone beeping)

52:36.023 --> 52:39.190
(soft dramatic music)

52:58.266 --> 53:02.153
Thank you for this
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:02.153 --> 53:07.153
Thank you for this
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:07.273 --> 53:10.088
Thank you for the
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:10.088 --> 53:12.733
(soft dramatic music)

53:12.733 --> 53:15.263
Thank you for the
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:16.944 --> 53:19.623
Thank you for the
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:22.395 --> 53:23.228
Oh no.

53:23.228 --> 53:24.773
Thank you for the
opportunity, Miss Perkins.

53:25.646 --> 53:28.813
(soft dramatic music)

53:43.050 --> 53:45.400
- Giancarlo Camporrosso.

53:45.400 --> 53:48.610
- You better not use any of
my articles in your project.

53:48.610 --> 53:51.777
(soft dramatic music)

53:54.240 --> 53:55.340
- Why the pseudo name?

53:57.410 --> 54:00.810
- Those are just ideas
I don't wanna explain.

54:00.810 --> 54:03.793
Helps me articulate my thoughts
regardless of the readers.

54:10.860 --> 54:13.223
- You're writing a book
about my brother's case.

54:14.270 --> 54:16.560
- No, I'm writing a book
and your brother's case

54:16.560 --> 54:18.173
just happens to be a part of it.

54:19.090 --> 54:20.650
Did you just figure that out?

54:20.650 --> 54:22.540
- Yeah, I thought you were helping me

54:22.540 --> 54:23.980
out of academic interest.

54:23.980 --> 54:26.370
- That is why I'm helping you.

54:26.370 --> 54:28.250
Your brother's case
just happens to be part

54:28.250 --> 54:30.453
of a much, much bigger subject matter.

54:33.970 --> 54:34.913
- Which is?

54:36.850 --> 54:37.970
- You write your book.

54:37.970 --> 54:38.803
I'll write mine.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.473
- I love the one where you talk

54:45.473 --> 54:47.103
about love being like a prison.

54:48.493 --> 54:49.783
It was so spot on.

54:51.490 --> 54:54.840
- In order for it to be love,
there has to be obsession so.

54:54.840 --> 54:57.193
- Few people get to experience real love.

55:01.410 --> 55:02.263
I did once.

55:04.900 --> 55:06.360
I loved this girl so much

55:06.360 --> 55:08.260
that I completely forgot about myself.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.090
It was beautiful.

55:14.210 --> 55:15.043
And terrible.

55:16.032 --> 55:16.932
- What did you do?

55:22.610 --> 55:23.827
- I had to let her go.

55:27.330 --> 55:30.433
- It truly is beautiful and terrible.

55:32.198 --> 55:34.950
It only gets worse when she's not around.

55:34.950 --> 55:38.173
It's like having your
chest ripped open forever.

55:39.035 --> 55:41.035
- Time heals everything.

55:41.960 --> 55:44.763
- The stump may heal but
the arm doesn't grow back.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.200
How can you replace the irreplaceable?

55:48.200 --> 55:49.613
- Why would you?

55:49.613 --> 55:51.260
- To stop the pain.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.263
- How far would you go to stop the pain?

55:54.230 --> 55:55.433
- Is this for your project?

55:55.433 --> 55:57.827
What is it you really want from me?

55:57.827 --> 56:00.494
(ominous music)

56:01.990 --> 56:04.700
- Nick isn't much of
an interesting subject

56:04.700 --> 56:06.270
if I'm being honest.

56:06.270 --> 56:07.970
- And you think I am?

56:07.970 --> 56:10.943
- You are the most interesting
person I have ever met.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.860
Everything clicked once
I read your articles.

56:13.860 --> 56:16.170
Okay, I've been writing nonstop.

56:16.170 --> 56:17.880
- I should warn you not to mention me

56:17.880 --> 56:19.393
in your project or your book.

56:21.830 --> 56:24.023
As your advisor, it's my obligation.

56:28.740 --> 56:30.013
- Understood.

56:31.509 --> 56:34.720
I just thought I could help you move on.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.663
- At my age, there is no moving on.

56:37.660 --> 56:38.763
Only cleaning up.

56:40.210 --> 56:41.310
- That explains a lot.

56:50.388 --> 56:51.721
I almost forgot.

56:55.610 --> 56:57.490
Julian Hansen.

56:57.490 --> 56:59.680
Apparently he was one of Gwen's lovers.

56:59.680 --> 57:00.930
I missed him the first time around.

57:00.930 --> 57:02.660
Didn't get to talk to him.

57:02.660 --> 57:04.100
- How did you miss him?

57:04.100 --> 57:05.680
- He's Nick's best friend.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.870
He was right in front of me so.

57:07.870 --> 57:09.570
But hopefully I'll talk to him soon.

57:09.570 --> 57:10.503
Maybe this week.

57:11.870 --> 57:12.893
- Another suspect.

57:14.210 --> 57:16.990
- Just another one of her men.

57:16.990 --> 57:17.823
- Well.

57:18.750 --> 57:19.910
Go get him.

57:19.910 --> 57:22.910
(suspenseful music)

57:34.760 --> 57:35.593
- Hey, honey.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.593
Are you okay?

57:45.880 --> 57:47.280
- When did I fuck it all up?

57:52.770 --> 57:53.770
I had it all, right?

57:54.680 --> 57:56.940
And then poof, I'm in prison.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.190
Nobody comes to visit me.

58:00.500 --> 58:02.333
- It was a complicated case.

58:05.038 --> 58:06.423
- Complicated how?

58:11.146 --> 58:11.979
- Well.

58:14.700 --> 58:17.370
For instance, it came up during the trial

58:19.110 --> 58:22.923
that Gwen was how should I say?

58:25.400 --> 58:26.903
Crazy about boys.

58:29.150 --> 58:31.503
And some of them were
your so called friends.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.520
- You never thought to tell me.

58:38.050 --> 58:38.883
- Why?

58:39.973 --> 58:42.640
She wasn't serious about any of them

58:43.600 --> 58:46.490
and it certainly wouldn't
have helped your case.

58:46.490 --> 58:49.780
It only would've made you feel
worse than you already were.

58:50.710 --> 58:52.810
- You could've saved me so much time, Mom.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.210
Now I'm trying to pick
up the pieces of my life

58:58.210 --> 59:00.160
and the only person I have left is you.

59:05.350 --> 59:07.917
- You were very checked
out during the trial.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.083
I did my best.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.593
Anyway.

59:16.550 --> 59:18.623
Julian got you that job interview today.

59:22.490 --> 59:23.590
- Wasn't an interview.

59:24.890 --> 59:27.543
Lady just wanted to see the
ex-con fresh out of jail.

59:28.540 --> 59:30.270
Made me so fucking angry.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.103
- Did Julian know?

59:33.103 --> 59:34.353
- I don't know.

59:35.300 --> 59:36.890
He wasn't there.

59:36.890 --> 59:38.690
He's not answering his phone either.

59:43.600 --> 59:47.390
- Maybe you could just
get away for a little bit.

59:47.390 --> 59:48.223
Take a vacation.

59:51.130 --> 59:55.050
I have some money saved up for
Rianne's graduation present.

59:55.050 --> 59:56.800
I could easily just-

59:56.800 --> 1:00:00.020
- All the money in the world
couldn't help me now, Mom.

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:02.593
Thanks though.

1:00:03.903 --> 1:00:07.070
(soft dramatic music)

1:00:14.870 --> 1:00:16.920
- Long time no see, stranger.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.251
- Thanks for buying groceries yesterday.

1:00:19.251 --> 1:00:20.084
- Yeah, no problem.

1:00:20.084 --> 1:00:21.560
I figured you were back to double shifting

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:24.785
trying to make up for your big withdrawal.

1:00:24.785 --> 1:00:26.035
- Please don't.

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:36.630
Have you spoke to Mariah
about moving in together yet?

1:00:36.630 --> 1:00:39.670
- Mom, I told you we'd talk
about when I finish school.

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:41.220
Nick can wait that much longer.

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:44.730
- But you have to remember

1:00:44.730 --> 1:00:47.510
that he needs more help than other people.

1:00:47.510 --> 1:00:49.030
He always has.

1:00:49.030 --> 1:00:50.680
He used to have this gate

1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:52.850
that all the other kids laughed at.

1:00:52.850 --> 1:00:54.120
- And he laughed along with them

1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:56.330
because he was too little to understand

1:00:56.330 --> 1:00:58.323
that they were laughing at him.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:03.500
I know.

1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:05.193
You told me many times.

1:01:06.230 --> 1:01:08.280
- And then you started growing up

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.940
and doing everything on your own.

1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:12.410
- Yup, so you had to bring me down

1:01:12.410 --> 1:01:14.510
to make him feel less inadequate.

1:01:14.510 --> 1:01:18.070
- He is your brother and he needs us.

1:01:18.070 --> 1:01:20.723
Is that too much to ask?

1:01:21.787 --> 1:01:24.553
- Mom, Mariah's waiting for me.

1:01:24.553 --> 1:01:25.743
- Goddammit, Rianne.

1:01:27.938 --> 1:01:30.690
What is it gonna take for
you to care for your brother?

1:01:30.690 --> 1:01:31.790
- Why?

1:01:31.790 --> 1:01:33.658
He's just gonna throw
everything away anyway.

1:01:33.658 --> 1:01:34.491
- We'll help him.

1:01:34.491 --> 1:01:37.252
- People like him can't be helped, Mom.

1:01:37.252 --> 1:01:40.419
(soft dramatic music)

1:02:03.923 --> 1:02:04.756
I'm sorry.

1:02:06.075 --> 1:02:09.242
(soft dramatic music)

1:02:26.030 --> 1:02:28.770
Babe, today's one of those days
where I need our safe space.

1:02:28.770 --> 1:02:30.083
- Who's Katie Morrison?

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:32.860
- What?

1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:35.740
- You left your email
account open in my computer,

1:02:35.740 --> 1:02:38.130
but it wasn't even your account.

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:41.310
It was Katie Morrison's
or whoever that is.

1:02:41.310 --> 1:02:43.010
- But you respected the
fact that it wasn't yours

1:02:43.010 --> 1:02:44.830
and you didn't touch anything, right babe?

1:02:44.830 --> 1:02:47.220
- Can you tell me what's going on?

1:02:47.220 --> 1:02:48.480
- Did you touch anything?

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:49.530
- You don't trust me?

1:02:50.608 --> 1:02:53.608
(suspenseful music)

1:03:04.232 --> 1:03:05.860
- That's just research, Mariah.

1:03:05.860 --> 1:03:06.890
You'd die of boredom.

1:03:06.890 --> 1:03:09.123
- Why don't you let me decide for myself?

1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:12.020
- What are you talking about?

1:03:12.020 --> 1:03:13.943
- Nothing about you is simple, boo,

1:03:15.134 --> 1:03:17.084
but I'm really happy with us right now.

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:20.750
If this is something that's
gonna change us, please stop.

1:03:20.750 --> 1:03:23.870
- Not everything is about us.

1:03:23.870 --> 1:03:26.560
- Anything that happens
to you happens to us.

1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:28.350
Whatever you do, we do.

1:03:28.350 --> 1:03:31.180
- We don't become one
person because we're dating.

1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:32.490
What I do is what I do.

1:03:33.542 --> 1:03:36.709
(soft dramatic music)

1:03:55.150 --> 1:03:57.653
- Love is not just about
what one person feels.

1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:02.181
It's about two people
sharing everything together.

1:04:02.181 --> 1:04:05.348
(soft dramatic music)

1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:12.960
Love is about trust and commitment.

1:04:15.068 --> 1:04:15.901
- I know.

1:04:16.930 --> 1:04:18.894
You taught me that.

1:04:18.894 --> 1:04:22.061
(soft dramatic music)

1:04:47.650 --> 1:04:49.833
I won't let anything change us.

1:05:03.310 --> 1:05:04.890
- Hi.

1:05:04.890 --> 1:05:07.010
I don't know if you remember my name.

1:05:07.010 --> 1:05:08.820
- I know who you are.

1:05:08.820 --> 1:05:10.180
I'm trying to understand
why you didn't text

1:05:10.180 --> 1:05:12.423
before showing up like normal people,

1:05:13.270 --> 1:05:16.063
but you probably got
institutionalized already, right?

1:05:17.090 --> 1:05:17.923
Nevermind.

1:05:17.923 --> 1:05:19.140
What do you want, Nick?

1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:19.973
- May I come in?

1:05:19.973 --> 1:05:20.940
- No.

1:05:20.940 --> 1:05:22.090
Just say what you need.

1:05:23.887 --> 1:05:25.087
- I'm looking for Katie.

1:05:27.218 --> 1:05:28.423
- She's dead.

1:05:30.010 --> 1:05:31.150
- Excuse me.

1:05:31.150 --> 1:05:32.470
- She's dead.

1:05:32.470 --> 1:05:34.940
She went missing in
October eight years ago

1:05:34.940 --> 1:05:36.130
a bit after Gwen was killed.

1:05:36.130 --> 1:05:37.290
You should really do your homework

1:05:37.290 --> 1:05:38.370
before going to people's homes.

1:05:38.370 --> 1:05:40.391
It's kind of wrong to just show up.

1:05:40.391 --> 1:05:42.920
- If she's missing, then
maybe she's still in hiding.

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:44.110
- Hiding?

1:05:44.110 --> 1:05:45.191
From whom?

1:05:45.191 --> 1:05:47.350
Nobody could've kept her
in a basement too long.

1:05:47.350 --> 1:05:48.950
Katie was like a feral cat.

1:05:48.950 --> 1:05:51.510
She would've dug through
anything and anyone to break free

1:05:51.510 --> 1:05:53.380
and then come home to tell me about it.

1:05:53.380 --> 1:05:56.120
- Wouldn't you have heard her come back?

1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:57.680
- The only reason I'm talking to you

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.650
is because I know you didn't kill Gwen.

1:05:59.650 --> 1:06:00.483
Whoever killed Gwen is out and about

1:06:00.483 --> 1:06:02.940
and it's the same bastard
that killed my daughter.

1:06:04.728 --> 1:06:06.336
- Got any theories?

1:06:06.336 --> 1:06:07.410
- The killer was in love with Gwen

1:06:07.410 --> 1:06:08.990
and killed her when he found
out she was with Katie.

1:06:08.990 --> 1:06:11.323
Then killed Katie out of jealously.

1:06:12.333 --> 1:06:16.700
Honestly, I think you were
probably more of a cover for Gwen

1:06:16.700 --> 1:06:18.200
to look respectable, you know.

1:06:20.039 --> 1:06:21.760
- You know, everybody keeps telling me

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:23.713
the killer was involved with Gwen, too.

1:06:24.632 --> 1:06:25.465
- Of course.

1:06:25.465 --> 1:06:27.610
Wasn't she stabbed 27 times?

1:06:27.610 --> 1:06:30.680
That's someone that was
hurting very, very badly.

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:32.330
If you hadn't been in prison
when Katie went missing,

1:06:32.330 --> 1:06:33.930
I would've thought of you first.

1:06:35.032 --> 1:06:36.440
- Got anybody else in mind?

1:06:38.012 --> 1:06:40.273
- I wasn't that involved in their lives.

1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:43.090
All this thinking happened later.

1:06:44.550 --> 1:06:46.227
- You keep saying he.

1:06:46.227 --> 1:06:47.870
What if it's a she?

1:06:47.870 --> 1:06:48.840
- He, she, it.

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.350
It doesn't matter.

1:06:50.350 --> 1:06:53.210
Someone with two hands and a broken heart.

1:06:53.210 --> 1:06:55.060
Anyway, I have things to do.

1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:56.068
Sorry.

1:06:56.068 --> 1:06:56.985
- Go 'head.

1:06:58.155 --> 1:07:00.530
- I meant I'm sorry you went to prison.

1:07:00.530 --> 1:07:03.010
I always thought you were a good guy.

1:07:03.010 --> 1:07:04.931
A bit dim but good.

1:07:04.931 --> 1:07:08.098
(soft dramatic music)

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:35.753
- Katie's dead.

1:07:38.003 --> 1:07:39.953
- I thought you said she was in hiding.

1:07:44.690 --> 1:07:47.410
- I emailed her and someone replied,

1:07:47.410 --> 1:07:49.873
but I don't think it was her actually.

1:07:49.873 --> 1:07:51.593
I actually think it's Julian.

1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:56.130
- Wait, what?

1:07:56.130 --> 1:07:56.963
- Here's my theory.

1:07:56.963 --> 1:07:58.520
So.

1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.427
Porter, he kills all the other ones

1:08:00.427 --> 1:08:01.400
out of jealously or spite.

1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:02.320
We know that.

1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:04.820
- Can't prove it but agreed.

1:08:04.820 --> 1:08:05.653
- Okay.

1:08:05.653 --> 1:08:10.653
So what if Julian killed
Gwen and then he kills Katie?

1:08:10.842 --> 1:08:12.740
- Why would he do that?

1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:14.030
Okay, he knew all along that Gwen

1:08:14.030 --> 1:08:15.646
was getting with other people.

1:08:15.646 --> 1:08:16.478
I mean, you were her boyfriend

1:08:16.478 --> 1:08:18.521
and he didn't try and kill you.

1:08:18.521 --> 1:08:19.990
- I thought about it a lot

1:08:19.990 --> 1:08:22.920
and I think it was
because Katie is a girl.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:25.550
- He felt threatened by one
girl than a bunch of guys?

1:08:25.550 --> 1:08:27.112
- It's just one girl, right?

1:08:27.112 --> 1:08:28.010
I mean, she's like thee girl.

1:08:28.010 --> 1:08:31.250
Like the only girl that
Gwen was ever with.

1:08:31.250 --> 1:08:32.500
That's gotta make her special.

1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:37.500
- I don't think it makes her
special, but I see your point.

1:08:39.830 --> 1:08:44.280
So, Julian hacked Katie's
email to get you offtrack?

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:45.680
- To push me towards Porter.

1:08:48.309 --> 1:08:50.017
- What are you gonna do?

1:08:54.050 --> 1:08:55.300
- I don't know.

1:08:56.589 --> 1:08:59.451
You know, Julian hasn't
responded to me in like two days.

1:08:59.451 --> 1:09:01.951
I actually think that he's
onto us being onto him.

1:09:03.486 --> 1:09:06.130
- Maybe we should leave it here.

1:09:06.130 --> 1:09:08.100
I mean, I have school picking up

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:09.733
and you gotta get a job so.

1:09:10.590 --> 1:09:11.590
- Detective quitter.

1:09:12.919 --> 1:09:15.559
Throwing in the towel already, huh?

1:09:15.559 --> 1:09:17.550
- Take a step back, Nick.

1:09:17.550 --> 1:09:20.880
You're twisting your logic
to see anything as evidence.

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:22.840
Why do you wanna stay trapped in the past?

1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:23.673
- It's not about me, kid.

1:09:23.673 --> 1:09:24.505
- Maybe it should be.

1:09:26.984 --> 1:09:30.023
You already gave up
nine years of your life.

1:09:31.057 --> 1:09:33.700
How many more are you willing to put in?

1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:36.040
- You don't have to help
me if you don't want to.

1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:38.663
- Thank you for mansplaining the obvious.

1:09:38.663 --> 1:09:41.830
(soft dramatic music)

1:09:47.853 --> 1:09:48.687
- Rianne.

1:09:52.030 --> 1:09:54.112
I was in prison for nine years.

1:09:57.490 --> 1:10:00.440
I only got three small scars though.

1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:01.400
Do you know how crazy that is?

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:03.343
Do you have any idea how rare?

1:10:05.690 --> 1:10:08.253
I was on like all the fucking time.

1:10:09.911 --> 1:10:11.893
I wanted to die a lot like everyday.

1:10:14.930 --> 1:10:16.690
Think about this.

1:10:16.690 --> 1:10:19.389
Thinking about this is what kept me going.

1:10:19.389 --> 1:10:21.490
This is the biggest part of a new me, man.

1:10:22.420 --> 1:10:23.952
You gotta take it or leave it.

1:10:26.050 --> 1:10:27.870
You know, it's not that
I don't wanna stop, man.

1:10:27.870 --> 1:10:29.520
It's not that I don't wanna stop.

1:10:30.963 --> 1:10:31.860
I would love to stop.

1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:32.960
I can't.

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:33.793
I can't.

1:10:35.180 --> 1:10:36.263
- What if it is true?

1:10:37.632 --> 1:10:39.520
What are you gonna do to Julian?

1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:40.853
Don't answer that.

1:10:42.570 --> 1:10:43.520
- I gotta find him.

1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:49.282
- I can't help you be this new person.

1:10:51.490 --> 1:10:52.883
It's not good for you.

1:10:57.330 --> 1:10:58.610
- That's fine.

1:10:58.610 --> 1:10:59.893
That's fine then.

1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:03.433
You can go back to playing
with your fucking dolls.

1:11:03.433 --> 1:11:04.943
I don't give a shit, man.

1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:10.094
- Fine, I'll do that.

1:11:10.094 --> 1:11:11.907
- You do that then.

1:11:11.907 --> 1:11:14.907
(suspenseful music)

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:29.990
- Wakey, wakey.

1:11:29.990 --> 1:11:31.297
- Five more minutes.

1:11:32.133 --> 1:11:34.460
- You can spend all day
here for all I care,

1:11:34.460 --> 1:11:35.883
but don't be late for class.

1:11:37.132 --> 1:11:39.090
- I don't care if I'm late for class.

1:11:39.090 --> 1:11:40.021
- Okay.

1:11:40.021 --> 1:11:40.973
Gotta go.

1:11:40.973 --> 1:11:41.806
Have a good one.

1:11:41.806 --> 1:11:43.050
- All right, babe.

1:11:43.050 --> 1:11:43.883
See you tonight.

1:11:45.130 --> 1:11:47.952
- Boo, if you're spending
all your time here,

1:11:47.952 --> 1:11:50.032
why don't we make it official?

1:11:51.190 --> 1:11:53.543
I'm not talking about the proposal.

1:11:54.510 --> 1:11:56.520
Just move in officially.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.230
That way you'll be closer to school,

1:11:58.230 --> 1:11:59.940
we get to spend all day together,

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.889
and you won't see your brother anymore.

1:12:03.530 --> 1:12:06.620
- If I move out, there's no going back.

1:12:06.620 --> 1:12:08.420
- So you don't think it'll work out?

1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:11.362
- That's not what I said.

1:12:12.900 --> 1:12:14.200
- I know.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.866
Just think about it.

1:12:15.866 --> 1:12:16.699
Gotta go.

1:12:22.189 --> 1:12:24.100
I love you tons.

1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:25.441
- Okay.

1:12:25.441 --> 1:12:28.608
(soft dramatic music)

1:12:46.305 --> 1:12:49.360
A love obsession surviving
the object of affection.

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:50.193
- I got your email.

1:12:50.193 --> 1:12:51.026
Sit down.

1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:55.280
Was it something I said
the last time we spoke?

1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:56.370
- Yes.

1:12:56.370 --> 1:12:58.343
Everything clicked the
last time we talked.

1:12:58.343 --> 1:13:00.490
Okay, I thought that a passion crime

1:13:00.490 --> 1:13:02.469
could reveal a part of a
person that was unknown to them

1:13:02.469 --> 1:13:04.490
and once that potential was unlocked,

1:13:04.490 --> 1:13:06.163
it could not be put away.

1:13:06.163 --> 1:13:07.920
- But now you think that obsession

1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:09.480
is helping to keep the door open.

1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:10.313
- Right.

1:13:10.313 --> 1:13:14.130
And when the obsession is
gone, the door can be closed.

1:13:14.130 --> 1:13:16.610
- But now the person
is aware of that power.

1:13:16.610 --> 1:13:18.469
The power that allowed them to correct

1:13:18.469 --> 1:13:19.580
all the wrongs done to them.

1:13:19.580 --> 1:13:21.530
Why would they give it up?

1:13:21.530 --> 1:13:25.059
- To not hurt the people around them.

1:13:25.059 --> 1:13:26.180
The other people they love.

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.620
- Yet a crime has been committed.

1:13:28.620 --> 1:13:30.290
Gears have been put in motion.

1:13:30.290 --> 1:13:32.520
And consequences will come.

1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:34.580
- Okay, a passion crime is just that.

1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:36.830
A blinding moment of pain and anger,

1:13:36.830 --> 1:13:38.090
but after that the obsession

1:13:38.090 --> 1:13:40.433
just feeds itself with more vengeance.

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:43.950
- What if the obsession is
helping to restore balance?

1:13:43.950 --> 1:13:45.280
- To the same things that twist it

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:46.559
and corrupt it originally?

1:13:46.559 --> 1:13:48.469
- Love is the obsession.

1:13:48.469 --> 1:13:50.020
Otherwise it's just friendship.

1:13:50.020 --> 1:13:51.120
Fraternal connection.

1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:54.853
- Love is trust and commitment.

1:13:56.670 --> 1:13:58.830
- Let's say you're correct.

1:13:58.830 --> 1:14:00.480
What are you suggesting?

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.610
How can you prevent the consequences?

1:14:02.610 --> 1:14:05.723
- Maybe it's not about
preventing the consequences,

1:14:07.530 --> 1:14:08.813
but surviving them.

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:12.653
- And you think you can?

1:14:12.653 --> 1:14:15.820
(soft dramatic music)

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:28.590
- Yes?

1:14:28.590 --> 1:14:29.880
- Is Julian home?

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:30.713
- No.

1:14:32.507 --> 1:14:33.993
- Hey, I'm Nick.

1:14:37.696 --> 1:14:40.697
I've been trying to reach
him for like a week.

1:14:40.697 --> 1:14:42.639
I haven't heard back from him.

1:14:42.639 --> 1:14:44.290
- Well, he's going through
something right now,

1:14:44.290 --> 1:14:46.023
so just give him some time.

1:14:48.505 --> 1:14:49.480
- I mean, is this normal?

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:50.420
Does he just take off for days

1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:52.200
at a time without telling anybody?

1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:53.059
- Yeah, sometimes.

1:14:53.059 --> 1:14:54.690
And he always comes back
feeling a lot better,

1:14:54.690 --> 1:14:57.288
so just give him some space.

1:14:57.288 --> 1:14:58.705
- What's he upset about?

1:14:58.705 --> 1:14:59.930
- That's none of your business.

1:14:59.930 --> 1:15:00.900
- Hey.

1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:02.300
Sorry.

1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:04.452
I'm just really fucking worried about him.

1:15:09.870 --> 1:15:11.910
- He should be coming home soon.

1:15:11.910 --> 1:15:12.743
- How do you know?

1:15:12.743 --> 1:15:13.840
What makes you so sure?

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:16.440
- Well, he wasn't planning
on leaving for long.

1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:18.627
His car's right outside.

1:15:18.627 --> 1:15:20.245
- Do you have a key?

1:15:20.245 --> 1:15:23.412
(soft dramatic music)

1:16:25.660 --> 1:16:26.493
Hey, man.

1:16:27.469 --> 1:16:29.571
Do you mind taking a look at this, please?

1:16:29.571 --> 1:16:32.737
(soft dramatic music)

1:16:34.753 --> 1:16:37.483
Dude, please look at this.

1:16:40.154 --> 1:16:41.952
- What is this?

1:16:41.952 --> 1:16:44.370
- I found it in Julian's car.

1:16:45.330 --> 1:16:46.780
- Is this a camera?

1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:50.219
- Yeah, he uses it when
he's like driving people.

1:16:50.219 --> 1:16:51.862
- Ew, a creepy recording.

1:16:51.862 --> 1:16:53.075
- Can you just play it?

1:16:53.075 --> 1:16:55.075
- Yeah okay, I'm trying.

1:17:00.942 --> 1:17:02.290
- What's taking so long?

1:17:02.290 --> 1:17:03.782
- It's loading, Nick.

1:17:06.910 --> 1:17:07.983
- Okay, that one.

1:17:07.983 --> 1:17:09.733
That one right there.

1:17:17.384 --> 1:17:20.384
(suspenseful music)

1:17:28.227 --> 1:17:29.443
- [Rianne] Holy shit.

1:17:30.539 --> 1:17:33.313
This could be enough to send him to jail.

1:17:34.318 --> 1:17:36.719
(suspenseful music)

1:17:36.719 --> 1:17:39.577
- [Nick] Why'd he wait until right now?

1:17:39.577 --> 1:17:41.559
- This is exactly what you needed.

1:17:41.559 --> 1:17:44.559
Okay, maybe he's gonna
confess to killing the others.

1:17:44.559 --> 1:17:46.952
- Why'd he wait until I got
out of prison to kill Julian?

1:17:46.952 --> 1:17:50.370
Why'd he wait so many years?

1:17:50.370 --> 1:17:51.202
I don't.

1:17:51.202 --> 1:17:52.090
- Hey, Nick, look.

1:17:52.090 --> 1:17:52.923
Listen to me.

1:17:52.923 --> 1:17:54.250
You have to go to the police.

1:17:59.973 --> 1:18:01.993
- Porter has to die.

1:18:01.993 --> 1:18:05.160
(soft dramatic music)

1:18:08.219 --> 1:18:09.291
- Nick.

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:12.459
(soft dramatic music)

1:19:26.736 --> 1:19:27.568
You can do this.

1:19:27.568 --> 1:19:29.081
You can do this.

1:19:29.081 --> 1:19:32.248
(soft dramatic music)

1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:35.883
Hey, hey, can you help me?

1:19:37.559 --> 1:19:40.780
I got a flat tire and nobody came

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.933
and I don't know how to take the tire off.

1:19:45.550 --> 1:19:47.930
- Well, if it's just a flat,
it shouldn't be a problem.

1:19:47.930 --> 1:19:49.480
I can change it for you.

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:50.313
- Thank you.

1:19:50.313 --> 1:19:52.496
Thank you so much.

1:19:52.496 --> 1:19:53.580
- No problem.

1:20:00.559 --> 1:20:02.350
- [Rianne] I'm just getting nervous

1:20:02.350 --> 1:20:03.873
because there's nobody around.

1:20:06.210 --> 1:20:07.400
- Totally.

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:09.499
I saw some homeless people
camping in the area.

1:20:09.499 --> 1:20:11.260
I mean, that doesn't mean anything but-

1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:13.800
- Yeah, that's what I was talking about.

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:15.414
- You have a spare?

1:20:15.414 --> 1:20:16.623
- In the trunk.

1:20:19.550 --> 1:20:20.620
- [Katie] Do you live around here?

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:21.452
- Not really.

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:24.197
- We met before?

1:20:24.197 --> 1:20:26.760
You look so familiar.

1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:27.743
- I would remember.

1:20:29.405 --> 1:20:32.755
- Well, you are kind of
cute, so maybe that's why.

1:20:32.755 --> 1:20:35.755
(suspenseful music)

1:20:56.002 --> 1:20:58.701
(gun firing)

1:20:58.701 --> 1:21:01.868
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:36.065 --> 1:21:37.282
- Hey boo.

1:21:37.282 --> 1:21:40.450
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:45.910 --> 1:21:47.094
If this is about you moving in-

1:21:47.094 --> 1:21:48.662
- Sh.

1:21:48.662 --> 1:21:51.829
(soft dramatic music)

1:21:59.925 --> 1:22:01.710
- Is everything okay?

1:22:01.710 --> 1:22:05.460
(soft dramatic music)

1:22:05.460 --> 1:22:06.293
- Yeah.

1:22:07.478 --> 1:22:09.431
I just need a minute.

1:22:09.431 --> 1:22:12.598
(soft dramatic music)

1:22:20.330 --> 1:22:22.386
- You sure everything's okay?

1:22:22.386 --> 1:22:25.553
(soft dramatic music)

1:22:33.511 --> 1:22:36.178
(alarm beeping)

1:22:44.689 --> 1:22:47.856
(soft dramatic music)

1:23:11.688 --> 1:23:12.793
- Excuse me.

1:23:14.270 --> 1:23:15.323
- Ah, Rianne.

1:23:16.170 --> 1:23:17.300
Good morning.

1:23:17.300 --> 1:23:21.677
If you're looking for Professor
Rossi, he's not in today.

1:23:21.677 --> 1:23:23.197
- How come?

1:23:23.197 --> 1:23:24.450
- I don't know.

1:23:24.450 --> 1:23:26.400
He's always been here earlier than normal

1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:29.410
and today he just wasn't.

1:23:29.410 --> 1:23:31.600
- Did you try calling him?

1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:34.803
- Well, it's more complicated than that.

1:23:34.803 --> 1:23:36.530
- Look, I'm not gonna leave

1:23:36.530 --> 1:23:38.918
until you tell me what's going on.

1:23:38.918 --> 1:23:41.323
Sorry, I'm just being honest.

1:23:44.130 --> 1:23:48.370
- A couple of police
detectives were here earlier.

1:23:48.370 --> 1:23:52.330
Professor Rossi's neighbors
heard gunshots yesterday

1:23:52.330 --> 1:23:53.743
and they called the police.

1:23:54.610 --> 1:23:56.378
When the officers arrived,

1:23:56.378 --> 1:23:58.952
they walked in and found basically-

1:24:00.192 --> 1:24:02.780
- They broken in probably.

1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:05.590
- They walked in and they
found nothing strange

1:24:05.590 --> 1:24:09.869
other than a strong smell of bleach.

1:24:09.869 --> 1:24:11.919
- Like somebody had cleaned up the place.

1:24:12.947 --> 1:24:15.440
- Yes, Rianne, like a crime scene,

1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.809
but don't jump to conclusions.

1:24:17.809 --> 1:24:20.030
The officers, they arrived
there fairly quickly,

1:24:20.030 --> 1:24:23.760
so it's hard to imagine
that someone did something

1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:25.790
and then they had time to clean up.

1:24:25.790 --> 1:24:27.930
- What else did the detectives say?

1:24:27.930 --> 1:24:29.193
Any homicide detectives?

1:24:30.077 --> 1:24:32.830
- They were just asking routine questions.

1:24:32.830 --> 1:24:35.330
It's not a missing person case yet.

1:24:35.330 --> 1:24:36.910
- So we're just hoping
that Professor Rossi

1:24:36.910 --> 1:24:39.639
will show up at a later
day, today or tomorrow,

1:24:39.639 --> 1:24:41.663
and just tell us what happened.

1:24:41.663 --> 1:24:42.963
- Pretty much.

1:24:44.327 --> 1:24:47.040
Is there something I could help you with?

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:48.980
- No, I just I had some questions

1:24:48.980 --> 1:24:51.670
about my senior project, but I can wait.

1:24:51.670 --> 1:24:52.940
I'll check back in tomorrow.

1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:53.773
Thanks.

1:24:53.773 --> 1:24:54.606
- Mm hm.

1:25:04.350 --> 1:25:06.960
- Mom, what are you doing here?

1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:09.580
- I told them I'd work from home today.

1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:12.232
Do you know where your brother is?

1:25:12.232 --> 1:25:13.065
- No.

1:25:13.930 --> 1:25:15.620
I was at Mariah's all day yesterday

1:25:15.620 --> 1:25:18.050
and then I went straight to school.

1:25:18.050 --> 1:25:21.032
- He didn't come home last night.

1:25:21.032 --> 1:25:23.407
- Maybe he's with Julian.

1:25:23.407 --> 1:25:24.702
- No, I don't think so.

1:25:26.130 --> 1:25:28.063
He sent me this text last night.

1:25:29.871 --> 1:25:32.910
I need some time away.

1:25:32.910 --> 1:25:34.410
Don't worry about me.

1:25:34.410 --> 1:25:35.243
Love you.

1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:38.059
Weird, right?

1:25:38.059 --> 1:25:39.577
- No.

1:25:39.577 --> 1:25:41.400
I mean, he has the money you gave him.

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:43.180
He probably just needs some time off.

1:25:43.180 --> 1:25:46.160
- Yeah, but it just doesn't seem like him.

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.877
- Mom, you just gotta give him some time.

1:25:49.764 --> 1:25:52.916
- I just thought that he
would stay a little longer.

1:25:52.916 --> 1:25:56.083
(soft dramatic music)

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:20.690
- I'll be at Mariah's if you need me.

1:26:20.690 --> 1:26:22.163
- Are you coming back tonight?

1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:28.666
- I'll see you at dinner.

1:27:05.541 --> 1:27:06.540
- Let's get going.

1:27:06.540 --> 1:27:07.553
- Holy fuck.

1:27:18.068 --> 1:27:20.930
The cops are looking for you.

1:27:20.930 --> 1:27:24.150
- They probably don't even
know where to start yet.

1:27:24.150 --> 1:27:26.553
(soft dramatic music)

1:27:26.553 --> 1:27:28.829
- You set Nick up.

1:27:28.829 --> 1:27:30.130
- You're welcome.

1:27:30.130 --> 1:27:31.360
You wanted to get rid of him.

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:32.573
I just played along.

1:27:36.110 --> 1:27:37.277
- Where is he?

1:27:38.258 --> 1:27:41.210
- Might wanna get rid of that video.

1:27:41.210 --> 1:27:43.532
It could link you to some bad mojo.

1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.100
- You were waiting for him.

1:27:48.100 --> 1:27:51.021
That's why the place was
clean when the cops arrived.

1:27:51.021 --> 1:27:53.433
- Glad to see your
education wasn't wasted.

1:27:57.018 --> 1:27:58.969
- What happens next?

1:27:58.969 --> 1:28:00.884
- We draw Katie out.

1:28:00.884 --> 1:28:01.717
- We?

1:28:02.647 --> 1:28:04.860
- Just a figure of speech.

1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:07.371
- How are you gonna draw Katie out?

1:28:07.371 --> 1:28:09.853
- Her mom lives in the same place.

1:28:12.430 --> 1:28:13.880
- What if Katie doesn't show?

1:28:14.827 --> 1:28:16.493
- Why wouldn't she?

1:28:20.224 --> 1:28:22.307
- There's plenty options.

1:28:24.630 --> 1:28:28.120
- You think Gwen loved
Katie more than anyone else?

1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:30.190
- I don't think it matters anymore.

1:28:32.523 --> 1:28:33.821
- Pull over.

1:28:33.821 --> 1:28:36.987
(soft dramatic music)

1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:41.993
- Wait.

1:28:43.389 --> 1:28:44.933
What are you really asking me?

1:28:46.050 --> 1:28:49.823
- Do you really think love
survives the object of affection?

1:28:50.790 --> 1:28:52.190
- It depends.

1:28:52.190 --> 1:28:56.141
Are you talking obsession
based love or deep caring love?

1:28:56.141 --> 1:28:57.891
- Is the answer different for each?

1:28:59.389 --> 1:29:00.223
- Yes.

1:29:01.126 --> 1:29:04.610
Obsession based love
may become more intense.

1:29:04.610 --> 1:29:08.830
Like any obsession intensifies
by the absence of the object

1:29:08.830 --> 1:29:12.090
because it'll be fueled
by fantasies and what ifs.

1:29:12.090 --> 1:29:14.950
On the other hand, deep caring
love may become more subdued

1:29:14.950 --> 1:29:18.013
because of the acceptance
of loss as facts.

1:29:19.487 --> 1:29:22.739
- You have a beautiful mind, Rianne.

1:29:22.739 --> 1:29:25.906
(soft dramatic music)

1:29:29.326 --> 1:29:31.076
- What just happened?

1:30:15.527 --> 1:30:18.193
(phone ringing)

1:30:22.096 --> 1:30:23.430
Hey, babe.

1:30:23.430 --> 1:30:24.900
- I love you tons, boo.

1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:28.093
- Babe, where are you?

1:30:28.093 --> 1:30:31.280
- Did you really think I
didn't know it was you?

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:33.947
(ominous music)

1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:37.493
- What are you talking about?

1:30:37.493 --> 1:30:40.982
- You knew Katie wasn't coming
back because you killed her.

1:30:40.982 --> 1:30:43.333
That's all I wasn't sure about.

1:30:46.290 --> 1:30:48.083
- If this is your idea of a joke.

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:51.490
- [Cameron] I'm a hopeless
romantic actually.

1:30:52.624 --> 1:30:54.593
Look on the table.

1:30:54.593 --> 1:30:57.260
(ominous music)

1:31:21.752 --> 1:31:23.469
- What do you want?

1:31:23.469 --> 1:31:26.736
- I want to know why you killed Gwen.

1:31:26.736 --> 1:31:29.403
(ominous music)

1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:35.226
Did you really love her?

1:31:35.226 --> 1:31:37.893
(ominous music)

1:31:43.416 --> 1:31:46.050
- I thought I was special to her.

1:31:46.050 --> 1:31:48.933
- Yet you replaced her so easily.

1:31:50.460 --> 1:31:52.193
- She has nothing to do with this.

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:55.200
- [Cameron] Of course she does.

1:31:55.200 --> 1:31:57.683
I'm gonna show you what
love is really about.

1:31:59.325 --> 1:32:01.403
- I don't love that bitch.

1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:03.073
Let her go.

1:32:03.073 --> 1:32:04.860
- [Cameron] You know the thing about love

1:32:04.860 --> 1:32:09.090
is once it's in your
bones, it never goes away.

1:32:09.090 --> 1:32:10.580
- No, that's just a fixation.

1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:14.020
Love nurtures, heals, protects.

1:32:14.020 --> 1:32:15.297
- I did all that.

1:32:16.141 --> 1:32:17.910
I healed her wounds.

1:32:17.910 --> 1:32:19.550
Nurtured her passions.

1:32:19.550 --> 1:32:22.184
I protected her from her own insecurities.

1:32:22.184 --> 1:32:24.219
- That was a long time ago.

1:32:24.219 --> 1:32:26.430
- [Cameron] Maybe you can
follow your own advice

1:32:26.430 --> 1:32:31.059
and just move on, but if not,

1:32:31.059 --> 1:32:33.913
how can you escape the
prison of her absence?

1:32:34.850 --> 1:32:37.183
- Just let her go please.

1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:41.317
- [Cameron] How long do you
think you can go without her?

1:32:43.295 --> 1:32:45.712
- Look, I'll do anything you want.

1:32:45.712 --> 1:32:47.190
- Anything.

1:32:47.190 --> 1:32:49.090
- Just let her go.

1:32:49.090 --> 1:32:50.639
- I always liked you, Rianne,

1:32:50.639 --> 1:32:52.719
but not even you can imagine the pain

1:32:52.719 --> 1:32:54.053
of going on without her.

1:32:56.059 --> 1:32:57.032
- What do you want?

1:32:57.032 --> 1:32:58.132
Would you just say it?

1:33:00.250 --> 1:33:01.773
- [Cameron] I want you to be free.

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:05.150
- Don't do this.

1:33:05.150 --> 1:33:08.358
- Go to the balcony and climb out.

1:33:08.358 --> 1:33:11.025
(ominous music)

1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:32.219
- Just put her on the phone please.

1:33:32.219 --> 1:33:33.202
- I'm sorry, boo.

1:33:33.202 --> 1:33:34.618
I don't know what happened.

1:33:34.618 --> 1:33:35.752
- It's okay.

1:33:35.752 --> 1:33:37.133
It's okay, babe.

1:33:37.133 --> 1:33:39.800
(ominous music)

1:33:41.223 --> 1:33:42.123
I love you tons.

1:33:44.690 --> 1:33:45.573
- [Cameron] I'm waiting.

1:33:47.323 --> 1:33:48.156
Now fly.

1:33:52.014 --> 1:33:54.764
(dramatic music)
