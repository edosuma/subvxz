[Laughing]

00:31.520 --> 00:33.520
Hi, guys.
Who's up tonight?

00:33.520 --> 00:34.760
Kiki.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.400
Kiki?
She just told one!

00:37.400 --> 00:38.520
So?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.120
So, what happened?

00:40.120 --> 00:42.520
Did she threaten to pound you if
you didn't give her another turn?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.160
She probably
could, too.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.200
Ahem! Wait till
you guys see this.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.560
Wow.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.080
[Whistles]

01:00.440 --> 01:02.000
Chill out, guys.
It's no big deal.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.440
I don't believe it!

01:07.040 --> 01:08.160
Y-y-you look like...

01:08.160 --> 01:10.400
Like...
Like a girl.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
What did you think
I was, squirt?

01:14.960 --> 01:16.600
Did you do this
for your story?

01:16.600 --> 01:18.520
Whoa. This can be
really scary.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.960
I'm doing this
to make a statement.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.960
Everybody's got
more than one side,

01:27.960 --> 01:31.200
so don't think you know
everything about someone

01:31.200 --> 01:33.440
by looking
at them one way.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.440
If you do that,
you could miss out

01:36.440 --> 01:39.040
on a whole lot
beneath the surface.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.480
And that could be
a major mistake,

01:44.480 --> 01:47.480
because what you don't
know about somebody

01:47.480 --> 01:49.880
could turn out to be
the one thing

01:49.880 --> 01:52.560
your life depends on.

Submitted
for the approval

01:56.960 --> 01:58.960

01:58.960 --> 02:01.480
I call this story...

02:17.480 --> 02:19.920
<i> Stacey was smart,
funny, pretty,</i>

02:19.920 --> 02:21.400
<i> and better at hoops</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:22.920
<i> than just about
every guy at school.</i>

02:22.920 --> 02:24.800
<i> But some kids
didn't see any of that.</i>

02:24.800 --> 02:26.720
No way. Forget it.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.480
This isn't
your call, Billy.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.040
We've got signals,
and we've got plays.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.360
She never gets it
until someone repeats it,

02:33.360 --> 02:34.920
and then it's too late.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.040
You act like she's
dumb or something.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.000
You said it. I didn't.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.480
He's just
being a jerk.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.040
What'd she say?

02:49.040 --> 02:51.640
She says maybe you're the
one who doesn't understand.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.160
Exactly.
We can't win

02:53.160 --> 02:55.040
if we've got to do
everything special for her.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.720
Stace, come on.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.200
Way to go, jerk.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.680
It's not my fault

03:04.680 --> 03:06.920
she's sensitive
about being deaf.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.200
I can't believe him.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.840
He's so... Ugh!

03:46.160 --> 03:47.440
[Footsteps]

03:59.440 --> 04:01.960
No geeks, no nerds,

04:01.960 --> 04:03.800
no freaks.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.920
Meaning?

04:05.920 --> 04:08.320
[Beeping sound]

04:08.320 --> 04:12.320
Adolescent phraseology
indicative of non-generic,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.400
behavioral or physical
characteristics to be avoided.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.880
[Zapping sound]

06:29.520 --> 06:30.640
Pass to him--

06:30.640 --> 06:32.480
what a move!

06:35.600 --> 06:37.240
Yes! This kid's
unstoppable.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.320
[Zapping sound]

06:41.160 --> 06:43.160
Yo. Kid.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.840
You talking to me?

06:44.840 --> 06:47.520
You've got excellent
moves on the court, dude.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.080
What are you guys?

06:50.080 --> 06:51.480
Scouts?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.640
Yes. Something
like that.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.840
In your dreams.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.680
Please.
Come with us.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.080
Yeah, right.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.640
What are you gonna do,
change my channel?

07:05.640 --> 07:08.920
[High-pitched noise]

07:56.280 --> 07:58.480
I say. What ho.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.320
Jolly good.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
Stop right there!

08:04.320 --> 08:05.800
[Zap]

08:09.200 --> 08:10.560
Malfunction?

08:10.560 --> 08:12.720
Negative.
You missed her.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.160
Hey! Let me go!

08:27.160 --> 08:30.640
[Screeching noise]

08:30.640 --> 08:31.720
The alarm!
Turn it off!

08:34.159 --> 08:36.360
Turn it off!

08:38.880 --> 08:42.120
The alarm!
Turn off the alarm!

08:42.120 --> 08:43.799
Turn to the left!
Turn it off!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.720
[Squelching noise stops]

08:55.240 --> 08:57.720
We won't miss again.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.680
<i>[Computerized voice] You are now

10:02.600 --> 10:06.560
We don't want you to
disappoint your public.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.400
Interesting.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.840
Hmm.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.440
As you can see,
by the display

10:19.440 --> 10:23.760
I had been
expecting a boy.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.160
In case your small mind
is curious,

10:29.160 --> 10:33.440
you are among the first
specimens we've collected.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.640
But soon we'll be
fully operational.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.400
Natural habitats.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.920
Exotic specimens.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.120
A foray of refurbished
snack bars.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.120
Oh, for the
delectation of...

10:50.120 --> 10:51.960
Humph.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.120
Well, let's just say
there are those

10:54.120 --> 11:00.240
who will pay handsomely for
such an educational experience.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.320
Do you do any tricks?

11:03.640 --> 11:06.560
Not very bright,
are you?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.440
Well, that may be
to your advantage.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.720
In my experience, the
bright ones don't last.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.560
If you're thinking
of escape...

11:24.600 --> 11:26.880
[Screeching noise]

11:26.880 --> 11:29.000
Understand?

11:34.160 --> 11:39.760
At first, the sound
merely paralyzes.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.080
After that,
your mind will feel

11:43.080 --> 11:47.560
as if it's seeping
out of your ears.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.000
Make yourself at home.

11:52.720 --> 11:57.840
You're going to be here
for quite some time.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.920
Come on, stop pointing
that thing at me.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.480
I'm going in, see?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.840
Stacey?

12:24.520 --> 12:26.600
Where are we?

12:28.920 --> 12:31.880
What is this place?!

12:31.880 --> 12:35.600
Perfect. I get stuck with
someone who can't even talk.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.920
I am out of here.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.920
What?

12:44.440 --> 12:46.880
Grrraah.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.920
Look--I don't get it.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.360
You're an animal?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.560
In a cage?

12:55.560 --> 12:56.960
A zoo!

12:58.440 --> 12:59.760
This is a zoo?

13:01.600 --> 13:02.880
Where are
all the animals?

13:04.560 --> 13:07.360
Yeah, right.
Like I really believe that--

13:09.440 --> 13:10.440
Who are they?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.240
I'm gettin' outta here.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.600
[Squelching noise]

13:42.400 --> 13:44.360
That new girl.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.840
Something odd
about her.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.480
I'm afraid she will
need to be eliminated.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.440
But don't alarm
the others.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.280
We don't want an
uprising on our hands.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.520
This really is
a zoo, isn't it?

14:26.680 --> 14:29.600
What is this?

14:29.600 --> 14:32.040
Hurry, or they won't
feed you!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.480
Oh, man.
Someone who can talk.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.520
Where are we?

14:51.520 --> 14:54.200
We call it the future.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
They call it the past.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.400
It's not bad
if you don't look at it.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.400
How long have
you been here?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.280
Just a couple
of days, I think.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.640
I was first, but new kids
are coming all the time.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.440
There's gotta be
a way out.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.120
No. The sound bars
are everywhere.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.280
What's wrong with her?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.480
She's deaf.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.760
Wow.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.920
[Whispers]
She's deaf.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.960
I don't get it!
What's the big deal?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.480
Don't you see?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.720
The keepers use sound
to keep us in.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.240
Man: Silence!

15:34.240 --> 15:36.120
[Screeching
sound]

15:39.800 --> 15:43.720
For the benefits
of our new guests,

15:43.720 --> 15:49.240
at feeding time
children should be seen

15:49.240 --> 15:51.560
and not heard!

15:56.800 --> 15:58.520
Not hungry?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.720
You will be.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.280
Feeding time is over!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.240
Get back to this place.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.240
When you finish
cleaning up,

16:16.240 --> 16:19.200
collect that one.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.840
We have to get rid of her.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.680
What happened?

16:42.680 --> 16:44.240
What's the matter?

16:46.040 --> 16:48.600
You can read lips.
What'd that guy say?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.600
Are you sure?

16:57.760 --> 16:59.080
Then run for it!

16:59.080 --> 17:01.840
The sound can't hurt you.
Nothing's keeping you here.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.760
What?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.280
What's keeping you here?

17:18.280 --> 17:21.280
They'll hear the alarms
and they'll get you anyway.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.640
Yeah, maybe you're right.
What's the second thing?

17:29.160 --> 17:29.920
Me?

17:30.720 --> 17:33.480
You wanna stay
because of me?

17:34.960 --> 17:40.160
Why? I haven't been
exactly nice to you.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.520
That's because
I can hear

17:43.520 --> 17:47.600
but you don't
listen.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.640
Well, I'm listening now.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.360
Have any idea how
to get out of this place?

18:07.240 --> 18:08.640
You lost me.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.640
You want a mirror?

18:10.640 --> 18:13.240
I'm doing my best, ok?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.120
Slow down!
That's gotta last!

18:18.120 --> 18:19.720
What are you doing?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.160
I get it.
The mirror! The foil!

18:23.160 --> 18:24.640
But why?

18:25.480 --> 18:26.600
Look out!

18:28.480 --> 18:30.800
The alarm
didn't go off.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.160
The light
reflected--

18:33.160 --> 18:34.680
the mirror.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.680
That's why you
need the mirror.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.720
You're a genius.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.520
It's stuck.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.920
[Crash]

18:50.920 --> 18:52.880
Uh-oh!
We're being watched!

18:59.240 --> 19:00.840
What about me?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.880
<i>Hey, you really
are a genius.</i>

19:26.400 --> 19:29.040
Come on! They've got
cameras! We've gotta move.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.360
Stop!

19:30.360 --> 19:31.640
Run!

19:37.960 --> 19:40.480
[Squelching noise]

19:51.680 --> 19:54.280
Now what? They'll be here
any second.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.520
Oh! The door!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.240
I don't get it.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.120
I think I do. Not bad.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.120
Where do you come from?

20:18.400 --> 20:21.040
<i>Man, you are good.</i>

20:21.040 --> 20:22.520
Come on! Hurry up!

20:25.160 --> 20:26.640
Billy: Where do you
come from?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.000
We've gotta hurry!

20:40.640 --> 20:41.760
Come on! Hurry up!

20:43.520 --> 20:45.160
[Banging on door]

20:47.080 --> 20:48.280
Move!

20:48.280 --> 20:52.040
Man: Children!
Open this door!

20:52.040 --> 20:55.240
Come on! We've gotta
get going!

20:57.240 --> 20:58.120
Move!

21:05.640 --> 21:08.400
Good bye.
Thank her for me.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.760
Come on, stace.
Let's book!

21:19.400 --> 21:21.880
Going somewhere?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.120
[Screeching noise]

21:23.120 --> 21:24.880
Primitive responses.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.520
I see I was right
about you.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.440
[Screeching noise]

21:29.440 --> 21:32.520
That's more like it.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.040
You disrupted my zoo.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.760
You freed my specimens.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.360
Now you're going to pay!

21:43.960 --> 21:44.720
No!

21:45.560 --> 21:49.600
You wouldn't want to hurt
your friend, would you?

21:52.280 --> 21:54.600
Stacey, please.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.240
Hit it!

21:57.360 --> 21:59.200
No-o-o-o-o-o!

22:03.480 --> 22:05.600
I'm going to find you!

22:07.520 --> 22:10.800
I'm going to find you!

22:10.800 --> 22:15.040
And bring you back!

22:28.560 --> 22:31.040
We're back. It worked.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.960
They're gone.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.840
I don't know
how to thank you.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.480
Oh. I get it.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.640
Thank you.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.720
You're welcome.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.520
After their strange
adventure,

23:09.520 --> 23:12.240
Stacey and Billy
became friends.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.760
No one believed their
story about the zoo,

23:15.760 --> 23:18.240
but they always knew
they could talk about it

23:18.240 --> 23:19.520
with each other.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.280
The end.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.520
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society closed.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.960
Kiki, you want to go
shopping tomorrow?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.520
Get real.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.560
Let's get out of here.
