We're about to arrive in Bangkok.

Any passengers alighting at Rangsit,

01:18.250 --> 01:22.583
please make sure you have all

01:28.000 --> 01:29.458
<i>I'm nearly in the city.</i>

01:32.208 --> 01:34.791
<i>I have an urgent problem.
I need your help.</i>

01:34.875 --> 01:36.500
<i>I'll tell you in person.</i>

01:38.375 --> 01:42.375
JO

01:52.791 --> 01:54.375
Do you think we'll make it in time?

01:55.166 --> 01:56.000
Of course.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.750
What an asshole.

02:11.708 --> 02:14.416
Do you know how to drive?
Did you buy your driver's license?

02:15.250 --> 02:16.083
Kat.

02:16.666 --> 02:20.333
You should ask yourself
how you got your license. Calm down.

02:20.416 --> 02:22.958
Are you messing with me?

02:23.041 --> 02:25.958
Kat, calm down. I don't want to die yet.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.791
Do you want to play with me?

02:29.875 --> 02:31.666
What's this?

02:33.500 --> 02:35.125
How do you play it?

02:36.166 --> 02:37.083
Show me.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.375
It's broken.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.041
Let me see.

02:43.666 --> 02:44.750
How is it broken?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.666
It works now. Here.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.291
You'd better

03:00.375 --> 03:02.375
be careful when you're in the city.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.708
It's dangerous. There are many bad people.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.666
-Okay.
-Good girl.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.208
Thank you so much
for fixing my daughter's toy.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.791
You're welcome.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.291
Do you live in Bangkok?

03:12.375 --> 03:14.708
No. It's my first time.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.083
I got a job here.

03:18.166 --> 03:21.458
Where will you go
when we get there? How about this?

03:21.541 --> 03:23.416
You can ride with me. We can go together.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.208
It's okay. My brother
will pick me up. Thank you so much.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.083
-Okay, then.
-Thanks.

03:31.791 --> 03:34.166
Hey, stop the car!

03:39.041 --> 03:42.333
I'LL GIVE YOU INFO ON RUAMPALANGJAI.

03:44.125 --> 03:44.958
Oops.

03:48.791 --> 03:53.000
Hey, about my idea for a story
on that illegal gambling joint,

03:53.083 --> 03:55.916
did you tell Wee for me? Did you?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.333
Yes, I did.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.666
But he didn't buy it.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.916
What? Why not?

04:02.666 --> 04:04.375
What's going on with him?

04:05.166 --> 04:06.000
Kat.

04:06.958 --> 04:08.208
Just be patient.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.166
You're still new.
You don't have much experience.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.875
What's the rush?

04:13.958 --> 04:15.541
So what if I'm new?

04:17.708 --> 04:19.375
BANGKOK-BUENGKAN KHON KAEN

04:19.458 --> 04:22.916
Anybody want a ride?

04:24.333 --> 04:25.541
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

04:25.625 --> 04:26.666
Where is building two?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.708
Over there. There's a sign
for building two.

04:28.791 --> 04:29.708
-Thank you.
-No problem.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.916
It's Wee. What should we do?
Who wants to take it?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.833
Can't they welcome the new CEO without us?

04:45.916 --> 04:48.250
Okay, Kat. You talk. Hi, what's up?

04:48.333 --> 04:49.583
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

04:49.666 --> 04:50.916
I told you to come early.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.541
-Mr. Artorn is about to give his speech.
-<i>We'll</i>

04:53.625 --> 04:54.791
be there in ten minutes.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.000
Make that five minutes.
I'll step on the gas.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.583
We were making ourselves
beautiful for the new CEO.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.375
Take it easy.

05:01.458 --> 05:02.791
Calm down.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.375
Can you make it in five minutes?

05:05.458 --> 05:07.000
Why not say 10 or 15 minutes?

05:07.083 --> 05:08.875
-It's too late.
-What?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.333
Go!

05:26.166 --> 05:28.125
Hey, young man. We meet again.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.541
Let me see.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.916
It's working now.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.375
Are you sure you don't want a ride?

05:36.458 --> 05:38.291
It's okay. My brother is picking me up.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.458
Good luck then.

05:39.541 --> 05:40.416
Thank you.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.208
Bye. Good luck.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.666
Bye.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.791
-That much?
-Yes.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
Kat!

07:07.833 --> 07:09.708
Hey, watch out! Come here!

07:25.583 --> 07:26.500
Kat.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.083
Kat.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.791
What?

07:35.500 --> 07:36.375
Kat.

07:40.708 --> 07:44.833
Namnueng! My baby!

07:44.916 --> 07:47.416
Please help my baby!

08:18.333 --> 08:19.458
Kat.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.583
Muay.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.458
My baby!

08:30.666 --> 08:33.166
Kat.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.416
Jo?

09:05.666 --> 09:06.875
Jo!

09:08.833 --> 09:10.250
-Jo!
-Bakchai.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.166
Jo.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.083
Hey.

09:17.541 --> 09:19.458
My leg is broken.

09:21.750 --> 09:22.916
Come on.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.583
MOBILE AMBULANCE CENTER

09:37.916 --> 09:39.458
Follow me as soon as you're done.

09:39.541 --> 09:41.291
Bakchai. Wanchai.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.166
Sir.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.166
Let me take care of him.

09:47.125 --> 09:48.916
-Step back, please. Step back.
-Bakchai.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.083
Wanchai, don't go.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.958
-Stay.
-Let them do their job.

09:52.041 --> 09:52.875
Stay still, please.

09:54.916 --> 09:55.750
You'll be okay.

09:59.625 --> 10:00.500
Jo.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.916
Sak.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.250
I'm sorry.

10:07.583 --> 10:08.625
I'm sorry.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.500
Don't speak.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.041
Aod!

10:14.125 --> 10:15.041
Yes, sir?

10:15.125 --> 10:16.041
His leg is stuck.

10:16.625 --> 10:17.625
-Hurry.
-Okay.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.041
Don't say anything now.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.000
My goodness.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.791
His right leg looks bad, Sak.

10:28.916 --> 10:29.750
Jo.

10:30.458 --> 10:31.333
Don't say anything.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.875
Jo is one of mine.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.833
Someone like you shouldn't touch him.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.125
Hey.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
Wanchai.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.791
-My brother. Jo!
-Hey. What are you doing?

10:59.875 --> 11:00.916
He's my brother!

11:01.666 --> 11:02.500
Jo.

11:03.541 --> 11:04.500
Jo!

11:04.583 --> 11:05.416
Hey.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.666
-Jo.
-He has no pulse.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.291
Jo.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.416
How is that possible?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.333
He was talking to me just now.

11:15.416 --> 11:16.541
-Jo.
-Hey.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.375
Listen, I'm sorry.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.375
-Jo.
-Listen.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.375
-Jo.
-Hey, get up.

11:24.291 --> 11:27.166
-Muay.
-Muay.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.750
-Muay.
-Hang in there.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.458
Go get help.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.916
-Someone's trapped over here.
-Muay.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.333
Excuse me. Let me through.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.125
Keng.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.875
Nay.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.166
There's another body here. Hurry.

11:53.916 --> 11:54.833
Put Jo in our vehicle.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.250
Excuse me. Is he
the driver of this sports car?

12:01.208 --> 12:02.833
Yes, but he's passed away.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.791
We're sending him to the morgue.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.750
Was he in the car alone?

12:08.666 --> 12:09.708
It looks like it.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.625
Thank you.

12:16.666 --> 12:17.666
Where are you taking my brother?

12:18.791 --> 12:19.625
Jo.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.208
-Pipo, help Bua.
-Go.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.625
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.333
RUAMPALANGJAI FOUNDATION

12:34.291 --> 12:35.125
Are you coming?

12:40.833 --> 12:41.958
Let's go.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.958
EMERGENCY

13:01.041 --> 13:03.041
The patient is unconscious.
We're doing CPR.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.958
Jo told me his brother
was coming from out of town.

13:15.958 --> 13:16.791
To be honest,

13:17.375 --> 13:18.583
you shouldn't have come.

13:20.791 --> 13:22.208
Take good care of Jo's body.

13:22.791 --> 13:23.625
Yes, sir.

13:24.583 --> 13:25.875
-Doctor.
-Yes?

13:26.833 --> 13:27.875
I need to talk to you.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.208
Okay.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.791
…Nine, ten.

13:40.958 --> 13:43.375
Take the body to the autopsy room.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.375
You heard him. Go.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.583
Sir, you can't enter.

13:47.666 --> 13:48.791
Let's get you treated first.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.250
Make way.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.291
Muay, we're at the hospital.
Hang in there.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.208
You're going to be okay.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.125
Muay.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.458
Muay.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.875
Muay, you have to be okay.

14:02.958 --> 14:05.458
-You can't go in.
-Muay!

14:05.541 --> 14:07.208
-Be strong.
-Let's treat you first.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.208
-Please come this way.
-No, I'm fine.

14:09.291 --> 14:10.208
Muay.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.875
You two, please wait out here.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.708
Please let us through.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.416
Kat.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.625
Muay is a fighter. She'll be fine.

14:37.541 --> 14:38.375
Trust me.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.166
Are you okay?

14:49.625 --> 14:50.500
Why?

14:51.416 --> 14:53.625
I want to know how it happened.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.000
Hey, what's the rush?

14:57.666 --> 14:58.541
Look at you.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.041
Why don't you take a break?

15:03.416 --> 15:04.583
I'll do it myself.

15:04.666 --> 15:05.750
Hey.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.083
I was shocked.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.458
There were so many people waiting.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.458
Excuse me. Were you at the accident?

15:14.208 --> 15:16.333
-Fine.
-I'm a reporter. Can I interview you?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.625
Sure.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.000
Can you tell me what happened back there?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.708
I was waiting for my friend
by the bus terminal,

15:22.791 --> 15:25.458
then this sports car flipped over.

15:25.541 --> 15:28.208
Was that the only car? Or…

15:28.291 --> 15:32.250
I'm not sure how many
there were. It happened so fast.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.791
Thank you for saving me.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.500
No need.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.250
How are your friends?

16:03.125 --> 16:04.500
One of them is fine,

16:04.583 --> 16:06.708
but the other one is in the ER.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.625
Is anyone you were with hurt?

16:12.958 --> 16:13.916
My brother…

16:15.958 --> 16:17.166
is dead.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.125
He was in the sports car
that caused the accident.

16:29.833 --> 16:30.666
I see.

16:32.541 --> 16:33.583
I'm sorry.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.250
Kat.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.083
We can see Muay now.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.458
Tell me if I can do anything to help.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.416
I'm a reporter.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.125
MATIMUANCHON

16:54.791 --> 16:55.833
Thank you.

16:55.916 --> 16:56.750
Let's go.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.041
Excuse me.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.333
Are you a relative
of Mr. Jirayu Praisoong?

17:11.416 --> 17:13.000
Can I see my brother now?

17:14.041 --> 17:15.416
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.833
You can't see your brother yet.

17:19.791 --> 17:20.791
We will do an autopsy.

17:20.875 --> 17:21.875
Dr. Tawan.

17:24.416 --> 17:28.250
The Ruampalangjai Foundation
will take care of the expenses.

17:28.833 --> 17:29.666
Right.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.583
You two, wait outside.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.958
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.125
Listen,

17:57.500 --> 18:00.083
Jo wasn't driving that sports car.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.791
I saw someone take
the driver away after the accident.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.291
Is that so?

18:10.166 --> 18:12.875
I'll ask the police to look into it.

18:14.750 --> 18:15.791
Stay strong, young man.

18:17.916 --> 18:18.916
Jo's no longer suffering.

18:23.666 --> 18:25.750
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

18:41.541 --> 18:42.416
Hello.

18:43.125 --> 18:43.958
Theep.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.375
How are you? It's been a long night.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.458
Yes, sir.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.166
There were many casualties.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.666
This is Jo's brother.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.833
What?

18:54.916 --> 18:55.958
Jo's brother?

18:56.708 --> 18:57.625
What's your name?

18:59.750 --> 19:00.583
Wanchai.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.583
Wanchai.

19:03.416 --> 19:04.875
I'm really sorry.

19:04.958 --> 19:06.375
I'd better get going.

19:06.458 --> 19:07.458
See you.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.833
I'll get going, Theep.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.000
It's late.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.458
Do you have a place to stay?

19:20.166 --> 19:21.291
I'll take you to Jo's place.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.250
You can sleep there.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.291

19:52.625 --> 19:54.333

19:56.541 --> 19:57.833
Make yourself at home.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.375
Don't worry about the rent.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.416
We'll talk about it later.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.333
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.041
Who is this guy?

20:06.875 --> 20:07.916
Jo's brother.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.375
This is the room.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.541
We're finished, sir.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.500
Pratheep.

20:35.791 --> 20:38.666
The police will find out
whose car it is, won't they?

20:39.416 --> 20:40.625
Of course, they will.

20:42.166 --> 20:45.458
I'll look into it myself tomorrow morning.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.791
As for Jo's personal life,

20:49.333 --> 20:50.458
I don't know much about it.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.583
What if he was driving?

20:52.666 --> 20:53.791
-It'd be--
-That's impossible.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.333
Jo wasn't driving.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.958
I saw the driver with my own eyes.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.291
We'll see.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.250
For now,

21:08.291 --> 21:09.416
we've had enough to deal with.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.083
If anything comes up,
drop by the foundation tomorrow.

21:13.791 --> 21:14.666
We'll talk then.

21:18.666 --> 21:19.500
Pratheep.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.500
If Jo had a sports car,

21:24.666 --> 21:26.833
why didn't he find a better place to stay?

21:28.125 --> 21:28.958
That's a good point.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.291
That's Wanchai, Jo's brother.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.958
Sweet, cool, and delicious.

22:48.625 --> 22:49.625
Hi.

22:50.541 --> 22:52.791
Have you eaten yet?

23:07.791 --> 23:08.708
You know what?

23:09.916 --> 23:11.500
There was a big accident tonight.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.958
We were all working hard.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.208
We're understaffed.

23:18.791 --> 23:20.458
Will I find your body on the street?

23:21.041 --> 23:21.875
Please.

23:22.541 --> 23:24.833
Working like you do would also kill me.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.000
Can you even pay Mom's hospital bills?

23:28.083 --> 23:30.958
I might as well go for a fucking ride.

23:32.958 --> 23:33.791
Cheep.

23:34.333 --> 23:37.083
Mess around all you want,
but you have training tomorrow!

23:44.375 --> 23:45.208
Let's go.

24:02.458 --> 24:03.375
You should get some rest.

24:11.708 --> 24:12.958
Be reasonable with him.

24:14.166 --> 24:18.791
He's a lot like you used to be.
Do you realize that?

24:42.916 --> 24:45.750
I'M NEARLY IN THE CITY.

24:45.833 --> 24:49.166
I HAVE AN URGENT PROBLEM. I NEED
YOUR HELP. I'LL TELL YOU IN PERSON

Hey, it's Chai.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.000
<i>Mom.</i>

27:35.583 --> 27:37.125
I have something to tell you.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.083
<i>Chai, how are you doing?</i>

27:39.166 --> 27:42.833
<i>I thought you'd forgotten
about us now that you're in Bangkok.</i>

27:43.833 --> 27:46.000
<i>Have you seen your brother?</i>

28:02.166 --> 28:03.166
I saw Jo.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.416
He's fine, Mom.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.541
<i>That's good.</i>

28:13.166 --> 28:16.625
<i>By the way, how's the money situation?</i>

28:24.083 --> 28:25.166
Don't worry.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.833
I'll take care of it soon.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.125
Don't think too much about it.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.166
I have to go, Mom.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.750
Please tell Dad

28:50.500 --> 28:52.041
that I'll send the money soon.

28:52.541 --> 28:55.583
<i>Okay, if that's all you have to say.</i>

28:55.666 --> 28:56.958
Call me often, okay?

28:58.916 --> 29:01.791
He found him. All is good.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.500
Jo is doing fine.

29:03.583 --> 29:04.541
See?

29:05.125 --> 29:07.125
My children are doing well.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.500
-Just like their dad.
-Yes, that's right.

29:59.958 --> 30:00.875
Jo!

30:03.041 --> 30:04.000
He has no pulse.

Why don't you take a day off?

30:36.333 --> 30:38.083
You were in an accident.

30:38.166 --> 30:40.250
As you can see,
there's nothing wrong with me.

30:52.458 --> 30:53.291
You dropped this.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.375
Here.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.083
Also,

31:00.166 --> 31:02.416
-take this food.
-Okay.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.333
Hold on.

31:07.958 --> 31:10.666
I forgot to ask
which celebrity you're meeting today.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.083
Get me their autograph.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.291
Mom.

31:13.375 --> 31:14.708
Drive safely.

Hey, guys.

31:46.458 --> 31:47.833
This is Wanchai,

31:47.916 --> 31:48.875
Jo's brother.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.958
Hello.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.500
Let's go. We can talk in the office.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.541
Okay.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.458
We have a newbie.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.291
Did Jo work for the foundation?

32:14.291 --> 32:15.291
Among other things.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.708
But working for the foundation

32:19.375 --> 32:20.875
barely pays anything.

32:22.625 --> 32:23.875
It's volunteer work.

32:26.083 --> 32:29.166
Jo must have had
another job in mind for you.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.541
What was it?

32:34.041 --> 32:36.125
WEALTH, PROSPERITY,

32:41.416 --> 32:43.791
Why don't you go check over there,

in case they need anything?

PRATHEEP SAENGTHARNSONG

32:49.750 --> 32:50.583
Hello.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.208
Pratheep,

32:52.833 --> 32:54.875
I heard that last night

32:54.958 --> 32:56.583
there was a terrible accident. Is it true?

32:57.333 --> 32:59.375
Yes, but we handled it.

33:01.333 --> 33:04.041
This is Ms. Malee,
the successor to the foundation.

33:04.916 --> 33:05.791
Hello.

33:06.958 --> 33:10.333
This is Wanchai,
Jo's brother. He arrived last night.

33:10.916 --> 33:11.750
My goodness.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.625
I'm so sorry.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.416
Your brother

33:17.500 --> 33:20.125
was one of our best volunteers.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.500
Please stay strong.

33:25.666 --> 33:26.500
Thank you.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.916
You're always welcome here.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.958
I need to get back to work.

33:36.041 --> 33:37.583
We'll talk about work later.

33:39.708 --> 33:40.666
Excuse me.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.000
Please sit down.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.041
I don't dare get involved.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.416
-You're a good dancer.
-Wow.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.458
You rock.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.083
Hi.

34:10.208 --> 34:11.458
Is business good?

34:11.541 --> 34:13.083
What, you don't sell noodles?

34:25.375 --> 34:27.750
Be careful in the big city.
It's dangerous.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.458
<i>There are a lot of bad people.</i>

34:31.458 --> 34:32.958
Cake, hurry up.

34:33.541 --> 34:35.125
-What are you doing?
-What?

34:54.166 --> 34:56.416
The police investigation
has concluded that

34:56.500 --> 34:58.916
this sports car flipped over

34:59.000 --> 35:02.583
and caused the accident here last night.

35:02.666 --> 35:06.250
A total of 12 people died
and over 30 were injured.

35:06.333 --> 35:10.583
The driver of the sports car was a man
named Jirayu Praisoong, or Jo, aged 38,

35:10.666 --> 35:13.583
a former volunteer rescue worker
at the Ruampalangjai Foundation.

35:13.666 --> 35:17.208
The police are still investigating
how Jirayu lost control of his car.

35:17.291 --> 35:19.625
There are also questions

35:19.708 --> 35:23.666
as to how a volunteer rescue worker
could afford such a luxurious sports car?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.125
The public is asking questions

35:25.208 --> 35:26.791
about this tragedy,

35:26.875 --> 35:29.250
whether there's more
to the story than meets the eye,

35:29.333 --> 35:32.583
especially concerning
Jirayu 's work as a rescuer

35:32.666 --> 35:34.791
and his past misdemeanors.

35:34.875 --> 35:39.333
Social media is rife with accusations
concerning Jirayu and a past accident

35:39.416 --> 35:42.333
that is believed to have been
caused by volunteer rescuers.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.500
If I'd been concentrating,
Muay would have been--

36:47.583 --> 36:49.166
Don't blame yourself, Kat.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.625
It was an accident.

36:54.958 --> 36:55.833
Sir…

36:57.916 --> 36:58.833
do you know

36:58.916 --> 37:00.625
what Muay has been investigating?

37:06.291 --> 37:07.125
It's…

37:08.375 --> 37:09.875
the rescue foundation.

37:09.958 --> 37:12.166
I tried to stop her.
I told her it's not worth it.

37:16.916 --> 37:20.083
These days, why do you seem to be

37:20.166 --> 37:23.875
against us covering the news
that could benefit society?

37:26.458 --> 37:28.625
What are you talking about?

37:29.208 --> 37:31.916
Well, there's the rescue story
Muay was on, and then there's

37:33.291 --> 37:35.500
the illegal gambling joint
that I wanted to do.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.958
You brushed them both off,
even though these topics--

37:38.041 --> 37:39.291
Don't talk nonsense.

37:39.375 --> 37:40.541
-But--
-Sir.

37:41.541 --> 37:44.500
Do you still have the old files?

37:44.583 --> 37:45.416
I'll take a look.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.333
Thank you.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.500

37:50.375 --> 37:51.416

38:02.500 --> 38:05.416

Hello, Tui.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.250
Hi, Kat.

38:51.708 --> 38:52.625
Hello.

38:53.708 --> 38:57.125
I don't think we met
at the party last night.

38:57.208 --> 38:58.333
I'm Artorn.

39:00.291 --> 39:01.125
Hi.

39:01.625 --> 39:03.250
I know who you are.

39:03.333 --> 39:05.458
And you are?

39:05.541 --> 39:06.750
I'm Kat.

39:06.833 --> 39:09.791
Are you the Kat who was
in the accident last night?

39:09.875 --> 39:12.166
I heard one of our reporters
got seriously injured.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.125
That's right.

39:13.916 --> 39:14.750
Her name is Muay.

39:15.708 --> 39:17.458
She's in a coma right now.

39:18.083 --> 39:20.875
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:20.958 --> 39:24.291
Unfortunately, my schedule
is full at the moment.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.833
There's a lot of restructuring to do here,

39:26.916 --> 39:28.500
as well as meeting with sponsors.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.916
Otherwise, I'd definitely
make time to visit Muay.

39:56.416 --> 39:57.666

40:01.791 --> 40:04.083
<i>I tried infiltrating the Rescue Team.</i>

40:20.208 --> 40:22.541
PHONE LOST IN ACCIDENT.
PARAMEDICS DON'T KNOW.

40:22.625 --> 40:26.291
WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE ME TO A HOSPITAL
NEARBY. WE WENT SO FAR. #RUAMPALANGJAI

40:26.375 --> 40:28.416
I LOST SOME JEWELRY MY MOM GAVE ME.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.041
IT SEEMS THE RESCUERS TOOK IT.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.375
FORMER RUAMPALANGJAI RESCUER
JAILED FOR THEFT.

40:38.125 --> 40:41.250
HE STARTED A NEW FOUNDATION, JAITHAM.

40:43.833 --> 40:44.666
Muay?

40:50.500 --> 40:51.708
A rescue worker stealing money?

40:53.666 --> 40:54.625
"Jaitham."

41:05.666 --> 41:07.625
MR. WEE

41:07.708 --> 41:08.541
Yes, sir?

41:10.083 --> 41:12.125
<i>Kat, don't forget</i>

41:12.208 --> 41:14.541
<i>the celebrity story
I asked for. I want it tonight.</i>

41:16.166 --> 41:17.000
<i>Kat.</i>

41:17.875 --> 41:19.625
Yes, sir.

41:25.333 --> 41:26.458
Why does he keep bugging me?

41:27.416 --> 41:29.208
Why would I care
if those celebs want to bang?

41:37.458 --> 41:38.833
We're here. Over there.

41:38.916 --> 41:40.125
-Over there?
-That's right.

41:46.041 --> 41:47.125
How much?

41:47.208 --> 41:48.041
Eighty baht.

41:48.625 --> 41:49.458
Thank you.

41:52.083 --> 41:54.750
Please have a seat. Sit down.

42:03.750 --> 42:07.375
JAITHAM RESCUE FOUNDATION

42:18.375 --> 42:23.958
LOOKS AFTER YOURSELVES WHEN YOU'RE
OUT WORKING. FROM PO, JAITHAM.

42:26.333 --> 42:27.541
Give me some rice.

42:30.916 --> 42:31.750
Here you go.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.541
-Thank you.
-This is my mom.

42:35.583 --> 42:36.750
-Hello.
-Hello.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.208
I'm going back to the kitchen.

42:43.666 --> 42:45.208
The foundation is empty during the day.

42:47.416 --> 42:49.708
Most of them are out, waiting for calls.

42:51.583 --> 42:54.750
This is where we usually meet up.

42:57.791 --> 42:59.208
You coming all the way here…

43:01.125 --> 43:02.125
is no coincidence, is it?

43:07.666 --> 43:08.541
Last night…

43:11.458 --> 43:13.333
When you were trying to help Jo…

43:17.333 --> 43:19.041
I saw Jo talking to you about something.

43:22.416 --> 43:23.458
He said he was sorry.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.250
To be honest…

43:28.833 --> 43:30.166
I don't get it either.

43:36.708 --> 43:39.083
I used to volunteer at Ruampalangjai,
but that was a long time ago.

43:42.333 --> 43:44.166
Jo and I worked together.

43:45.791 --> 43:46.708
But it's fair to say…

43:47.958 --> 43:49.416
we were in different groups.

43:57.958 --> 43:59.083
How long since you left?

44:00.375 --> 44:01.208
It's a long story.

44:03.666 --> 44:04.750
As for Jo,

44:06.208 --> 44:07.416
we didn't stay in touch.

44:13.333 --> 44:14.500
I'm sorry.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.875
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

44:27.458 --> 44:28.666
Yes. Thanks.

44:30.375 --> 44:32.000
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

44:32.083 --> 44:34.666
Where is the Jaitham Foundation?

44:34.750 --> 44:38.291
There. The guy in the hat. That's him.

44:46.666 --> 44:48.583
<i>Control calling Jaitham. Code seven.</i>

44:48.666 --> 44:50.750
<i>We received a report
of a person being impaled.</i>

44:50.833 --> 44:51.916
This is two speaking.

44:52.000 --> 44:52.833
I'm on my way.

44:53.750 --> 44:54.791
Excuse me.

44:54.875 --> 44:58.166
-Mom, I have to go.
-Sure. You go ahead.

44:58.250 --> 44:59.083
Do you mind

45:00.208 --> 45:01.250
if I go with you?

45:06.166 --> 45:08.000
Hey!

45:08.083 --> 45:09.208
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

45:09.291 --> 45:10.458
Hey, wait!

45:13.583 --> 45:14.583
What's the rush?

45:21.166 --> 45:23.333
<i>Ten, head to the site. Fifteen?</i>

45:23.416 --> 45:24.875
<i>The injured party is aged 35.</i>

45:24.958 --> 45:28.708
<i>It's a three-meter-high fence.
His leg is stuck. He can't move.</i>

45:31.500 --> 45:33.416
The ladder is here, Aod.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.958
Calm down. Take it easy.

45:35.041 --> 45:37.291
-Take deep breaths.
-Let us through.

45:37.375 --> 45:38.750
Right over there.

45:40.416 --> 45:42.875
We're from the foundation.
Let us take it from here.

45:44.166 --> 45:45.666
Drop the leg.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.666
-The rescuers are here.
-Let me take over.

45:47.750 --> 45:49.291
I'm coming. Stay still.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.375
-Hey, there.
-Help me.

45:51.458 --> 45:52.958
-I'll go.
-Please step back.

45:53.041 --> 45:54.791
-Hurry up.
-Let me help you.

45:56.458 --> 45:58.291
His pulse is racing, Doctor.

45:58.375 --> 46:00.708
-Give him oxygen now.
-Bring the cutter.

46:02.958 --> 46:04.916
-Hold it.
-Sir.

46:05.000 --> 46:05.833
Give it here.

46:07.583 --> 46:08.750
Pipo, Bua, hurry.

46:09.333 --> 46:10.625
Try not to move.

46:10.708 --> 46:12.083
Put your hands around my neck.

46:12.166 --> 46:14.208
-Cheep, get the cutter.
-Sure.

46:14.291 --> 46:16.041
Take a deep breath.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.833
Please prepare an IV line and saline.

46:19.916 --> 46:21.666
Please calm down. You're safe now.

46:22.791 --> 46:24.041
He's about to pass out.

46:24.125 --> 46:26.750
Take deep breaths.
The oxygen tank is here.

46:27.375 --> 46:28.416
Hey.

46:28.958 --> 46:31.458
-The patient is unconscious.
-Can somebody hold him?

46:31.541 --> 46:33.583
-I need a hand.
-He's unconscious!

46:33.666 --> 46:35.708
I'm coming. Take the lines.

46:35.791 --> 46:36.750
Sorry.

46:37.708 --> 46:38.833
Hurry up!

46:41.708 --> 46:43.916
-Sir.
-Hey.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.541
Hold on.

46:45.625 --> 46:47.666
Hang in there.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.250
We won't abandon you.

46:50.333 --> 46:52.958
The doctor is here. Don't worry.

46:54.958 --> 46:56.666
-Cheep! The cutter, now!
-I'm on it.

46:57.458 --> 46:58.583
Hey.

47:04.458 --> 47:05.958
It's nearly through. Stay calm.

47:06.041 --> 47:08.416
It's coming off.
A little more. Just a little more.

47:09.333 --> 47:11.583
Okay. It's through.

47:12.208 --> 47:13.250
Slow and steady.

47:14.291 --> 47:15.458
Give me a hand.

47:15.541 --> 47:18.250
-Step back, please.
-Hold the stretcher.

47:18.333 --> 47:19.375
Hurry up.

47:20.375 --> 47:22.500
-Hurry up.
-Hold him up.

47:23.958 --> 47:26.291
Cheep, pack up the equipment.

47:28.875 --> 47:29.791
Hey.

47:30.750 --> 47:31.666
Are you all right?

47:34.708 --> 47:35.541
Are you okay?

47:39.250 --> 47:40.625
You're new to this, right?

47:42.250 --> 47:43.708
You'll be fine.

47:53.375 --> 47:55.666
JAITHAM FOUNDATION

47:58.541 --> 47:59.375
Cheep, come on.

48:01.416 --> 48:02.500
Hurry up.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.208
Wanchai.

48:07.291 --> 48:08.458
Let's go.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.833
I'll find my own way back.

48:18.041 --> 48:18.875
Damn!

48:26.000 --> 48:28.083
-Has your car broken down?
-It…

48:29.458 --> 48:30.541
Yes.

48:30.625 --> 48:32.166
It's old.

48:32.250 --> 48:33.375
It's my mom's.

48:34.416 --> 48:37.250
Can you open the hood?

48:37.333 --> 48:40.041
Do you have water and a cloth?

48:43.541 --> 48:46.083
I only have water. I don't have a cloth.

48:48.208 --> 48:49.875
That's okay. Just water is fine.

48:55.291 --> 48:56.250
Please open the hood.

49:26.791 --> 49:28.083
I think it's the radiator.

49:33.000 --> 49:33.833
All sorted.

49:36.250 --> 49:38.250
Thank you.

49:38.333 --> 49:41.833
I think you should have
the radiator checked out.

49:41.916 --> 49:42.875
Take the car to a garage.

49:43.666 --> 49:44.500
So…

49:45.250 --> 49:47.125
how will you get home?

49:52.291 --> 49:53.333
Do you want a ride?

50:00.333 --> 50:01.250
Thank you.

50:04.958 --> 50:05.791
Here you go.

50:06.875 --> 50:08.375
That's my shirt.

50:14.958 --> 50:17.500
Put your seat belt on.

50:18.208 --> 50:19.916
You should put your shirt on first.

50:26.458 --> 50:28.750
Pull over on the right.

50:28.833 --> 50:31.125
-Where?
-Right there, by the alley.

50:31.208 --> 50:32.083
-Whoops.
-There.

50:39.416 --> 50:40.541
Thank you for the ride.

50:41.250 --> 50:42.208
Don't mention it.

50:42.791 --> 50:44.416
Actually,

50:45.708 --> 50:48.375
I wanted to talk to you
about what happened last night,

50:49.583 --> 50:52.250
but I suppose you need time to grieve.

50:53.666 --> 50:55.625
If you have time, I'd like to talk to you.

50:56.791 --> 50:59.208
A colleague of mine who's a reporter

50:59.291 --> 51:00.875
was in the accident last night.

51:01.875 --> 51:05.500
She's been working on a story
about the Ruampalangjai Foundation.

51:07.916 --> 51:09.791
I only just found out about Ruampalangjai.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.250
I'm sorry, I might not be much help.

51:14.791 --> 51:16.458
I'll get going then.

51:25.125 --> 51:25.958
Wanchai.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.583
Yes?

51:31.916 --> 51:32.750
Well…

51:34.041 --> 51:35.958
How well do you know Somsak?

51:38.000 --> 51:38.916
We just met.

51:39.958 --> 51:41.791
He helped my brother after the accident.

51:43.166 --> 51:46.125
Did you know
that Somsak used to work here?

51:48.041 --> 51:48.875
I know.

51:49.708 --> 51:52.416
Do you also know that Somsak was jailed

51:53.000 --> 51:54.541
for stealing money from the foundation?

51:57.333 --> 51:59.458
My colleague was looking into it.

52:00.875 --> 52:03.458
I think it's probably related

52:04.041 --> 52:05.833
to corruption within the foundation.

52:14.708 --> 52:16.125
I came across something strange too.

52:17.208 --> 52:19.708
Something strange? What is it?

52:20.791 --> 52:22.791
I saw one of the Ruampalangjai volunteers

52:24.416 --> 52:26.500
wearing a necklace
belonging to this kid I met.

52:27.541 --> 52:29.541
<i>The kid died in the accident last night.</i>

52:31.291 --> 52:33.208
I'm sure it's the same necklace.

52:34.583 --> 52:35.541
To be honest,

52:36.541 --> 52:37.625
this line of work

52:38.708 --> 52:41.500
lends itself to dishonest people
doing things like that.

52:43.208 --> 52:44.041
I know.

52:49.666 --> 52:50.500
So…

52:51.375 --> 52:53.333
what are you going to do?

52:55.166 --> 52:58.250
I'll deal with my brother
and then go back home.

53:00.250 --> 53:01.500
I have no reason to stay.

53:02.416 --> 53:03.791
I don't know anyone here.

53:09.333 --> 53:10.375
Hi, Wanchai.

53:10.916 --> 53:12.375
You've only been in Bangkok for one night,

53:13.208 --> 53:14.458
and you have a girl dropping you off.

53:16.333 --> 53:18.458
I'll get going then. Let's talk later.

53:19.041 --> 53:20.000
Sure.

53:34.125 --> 53:35.458
I didn't mean to interrupt,

53:35.541 --> 53:36.958
but I wanted to take you

53:37.041 --> 53:38.083
to get a motorbike

53:38.750 --> 53:39.583
from Em's auto shop.

53:40.416 --> 53:41.416
-Okay.
-Let's go.

54:07.291 --> 54:08.333
Hi.

54:08.416 --> 54:09.250
Em.

54:11.208 --> 54:13.958
Get me a bike for Wanchai to use.

54:15.583 --> 54:16.416
Theep.

54:18.083 --> 54:19.708
I can't just take it.

54:21.375 --> 54:22.541
Come on, don't worry about it.

54:23.916 --> 54:25.041
When you find a job,

54:26.291 --> 54:27.791
you can pay me back.

54:28.333 --> 54:29.166
Okay.

54:30.041 --> 54:30.875
Here.

54:32.791 --> 54:33.625
It's inside.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.541
The third one along. It's gray.

54:36.625 --> 54:38.208
-I've filled up the tank.
-Thanks.

55:22.708 --> 55:26.083
<i>The police investigation
has concluded that this sports car</i>

55:26.166 --> 55:27.583
<i>flipped over</i>

55:27.666 --> 55:32.083
<i>and caused the accident here last night.</i>

55:32.166 --> 55:35.083
<i>The driver of the car was a man
named Jirayu Praisoong,</i>

55:35.166 --> 55:37.208
<i>or Jo, aged 38.</i>

56:13.833 --> 56:15.875
MOM, MISSED CALL

56:18.791 --> 56:22.000
<i>Your dad and I saw
the news about Jo. It's not true, is it?</i>

56:26.583 --> 56:28.458
<i>The news about Jo isn't true, is it?</i>

56:32.250 --> 56:35.125
<i>Why aren't you answering my calls?
Are you all right?</i>

56:37.416 --> 56:41.583
<i>Call me back. I'm so worried about you.</i>

57:17.958 --> 57:18.791
What?

57:27.000 --> 57:28.500
Come here. Come on.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.125
Dear.

57:42.750 --> 57:44.500
What's going on?

57:44.583 --> 57:46.458
Chai called, but the line was dead.

57:46.541 --> 57:47.958
What's going on with him?

57:49.083 --> 57:49.916
Kiew.

57:58.500 --> 57:59.333
Kiew.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.541
What happened to Jo?

58:01.625 --> 58:03.333
I asked you a question!

58:04.000 --> 58:05.500
What happened to Jo?

58:22.500 --> 58:23.541
How was it, Daddy?

58:24.416 --> 58:25.958
You made good time, Jack.

58:49.666 --> 58:51.541
Are you wondering

58:51.625 --> 58:53.333
why you got beaten up?

58:54.500 --> 58:55.416
The answer is

58:56.416 --> 58:58.833
because you are Jo's brother.

58:58.916 --> 59:00.000
What the hell are you talking about?

59:00.083 --> 59:00.916
Let me go!

59:09.250 --> 59:12.333
You don't get to talk until I'm done.

59:12.416 --> 59:13.250
You
