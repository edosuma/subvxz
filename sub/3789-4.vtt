01:19.178 --> 01:21.476
This place is beautiful, Vincent.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.209
You have really
outdone yourself.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.342
Not bad for a kid
from Queens, huh?

01:25.384 --> 01:27.716
Not bad for a kid from anywhere.
Who's gonna decorate?

01:27.753 --> 01:30.017
I'm gonna do it.
You know I got a great eye.

01:30.056 --> 01:32.524
- Lots of reds.
- Don't be an idiot, Drama.

01:32.558 --> 01:34.389
You know, I almost went
to Parsons, Shauna.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.055
What you mean you almost went
to Parsons? What does that mean?

01:37.096 --> 01:39.462
Get out of here.

01:39.498 --> 01:41.625
When are you gonna cut him
off already, huh?

01:41.667 --> 01:43.794
You know you're doing him
a huge disservice.

01:43.836 --> 01:46.202
Do you know that I carried
my brother for 15 years?

01:46.238 --> 01:48.365
And now he's living in a van
outside of a Target.

01:48.407 --> 01:50.705
- Really?
- We don't talk about him.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.439
How about your decorator?
You know how much I love your place.

01:53.479 --> 01:55.447
Carrie Carlson.
She's the best in the biz.

01:55.481 --> 01:58.075
I guarantee you she'll get you
into "Architectural Digest."

01:58.117 --> 02:01.018
Well, hook it up.
I'm gonna go christen the bathroom.

02:01.053 --> 02:03.044
All right.
Congratulations, sweetie.

02:03.089 --> 02:05.683
And to think this all started
from a Vicks commercial.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.556
Amazing!

02:08.594 --> 02:11.495
You guys are so fucked!

02:11.530 --> 02:14.795
I bet you're gonna sink
at least three mil into this place.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.597
I guessed five.

02:16.635 --> 02:19.627
- You must be freaking out, Eric.
- Cool as a cucumber, Shauna.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.163
- So not like you.
- If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.675
There you go, E.

02:23.709 --> 02:25.939
Finally turning into a human being
I can hang out with.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.378
See that? Things are finally starting
to pan out for me.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.814
I think "Variety" is gonna run
the "Aquaman" announcement tomorrow.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.318
- I'm hoping for the cover.
- Oh, cool. Don't let them use

02:33.352 --> 02:35.650
- that smiley face picture.
- I love that picture.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.246
Vince hates it.
It drives him crazy.

02:37.289 --> 02:39.382
Use the "What the fuck
are you looking at?" shot.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.393
Maybe we'll land him
the next Scorsese movie.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.621
- That'd be nice.
- Nice.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.594
I think we should turn
the pool to face south.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.066
Very feng shui.

02:49.101 --> 02:51.729
Will you just let the professionals
handle this stuff?

02:51.771 --> 02:54.331
Shauna, obviously
you never saw my condo.

02:54.373 --> 02:57.365
No, but I'm picturing
lots of leopard sheets and leather.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.639
You know you should go easy
on me, Shauna.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.168
I'm going in for surgery.

03:01.213 --> 03:02.874
Surgery?
Are you okay?

03:02.915 --> 03:04.576
It's elective.
I'd rather not talk about it.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.916
He's having his botched
adult circumcision corrected.

03:10.856 --> 03:13.950
Hey, Ronnie!
Yo, that 70" beast is for my room.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.927
Vince only wanted a 50".

03:15.961 --> 03:17.952
I swear to God!
Ask him.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.158
- Hello.
- Yo, Suit.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.829
Billy, how are you?

03:24.870 --> 03:27.532
I'm fucking amazing!
Guess what?

03:27.573 --> 03:29.700
- What, you finally showered?
- Fuck you.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.710
- We got into Sundance!
- We got in!

03:31.744 --> 03:34.144
- We got into Sundance!
- We're in, motherfucker!

03:34.180 --> 03:36.740
Gonna be the first back-to-back winner
in the festival's history.

03:36.782 --> 03:39.615
Vince, come here! Congratulations,
Billy. You did a great job.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.643
If you go out tonight, call me.
We'll celebrate.

03:41.687 --> 03:43.552
Absolutely.

03:43.589 --> 03:46.854
- "Queens Blvd." got into Sundance.
- Wow. That's awesome.

03:46.892 --> 03:48.689
We are having
a fuckin' good month!

03:48.727 --> 03:50.718
Good job, E.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.323
This and "Aquaman" will get us
the "Variety" cover for sure.

03:53.365 --> 03:55.196
Sundance, baby.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.498
Yeah. You did this.

04:00.372 --> 04:02.203
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Hi.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.674
Is he decent?

04:03.709 --> 04:06.177
Eric, I'll deny I said this,
but no, he's not decent.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.679
He's an awful human being.

04:07.713 --> 04:09.476
You'll have to bring
your own thermals.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.745
But I'll get you
on all the hot party lists.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.378
Turtle did this.
Not bad, right?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.450
You know "The Station
Agent," Eric?

04:18.490 --> 04:22.324
- Yeah.
- Monster fuckin' hit at Sundance!

04:22.361 --> 04:25.387
Did you see it? It's about the midget
who lives by the train tracks.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.831
The last time I saw him,
he was in a FedEx commercial.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.664
They were overnighting him
to London.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.728
His name is Peter Dinklage. He's doing
a movie with Vin Diesel right now.

04:32.771 --> 04:34.830
Really? Which one?
Is it "Twins Part Deux"?

04:34.874 --> 04:37.502
You'll never give me credit
for anything, will you?

04:37.543 --> 04:41.138
You got me. Are you kidding? Sundance
is a great festival for little people.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.081
You should kill over there.
But for the rest of us normal folk,

04:44.116 --> 04:45.845
it's just a chance to try
to fuck a Mormon.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.877
Whoo! Pleasure as always, Ari.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.718
- I'll see you on the slopes.
- Eric.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.519
- Yeah?
- Sit down.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.957
What's up?

04:55.227 --> 04:57.422
It's about
the "Aquaman" offer.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.796
- What about it?
- It's M.I.A.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.893
- What do you mean?
- I mean we don't have it yet.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.699
What do you mean?
We already had it.

05:05.738 --> 05:08.298
We had it,
but we haven't gotten it.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.274
We're waiting
on the paperwork, right?

05:10.309 --> 05:11.936
Yeah, I've been waiting.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.306
Okay, all right.
I'm missing something here.

05:16.348 --> 05:19.408
- They made us an offer and we accepted.
- Uh-huh. Yup.

05:19.451 --> 05:21.851
And you said we were waiting on
the paperwork. So what's goin' on?

05:21.887 --> 05:24.981
- I don't know.
- Well pick up the phone and find out!

05:25.024 --> 05:27.458
You don't think
that I've picked up the fucking phone?

05:27.493 --> 05:30.291
- Well, pick it up again!
- I told you guys not to sit on this!

05:30.329 --> 05:33.958
You know how much time was wasted
getting Drama on as his personal chef

05:33.999 --> 05:36.524
and Turtle as his driver?
I mean, come on.

05:36.568 --> 05:39.196
Ari, you realize that Vince
just bought a house for $5 million.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.706
Was I the one that told you guys
to do a 10-day escrow?

05:42.975 --> 05:45.102
Ari, find out
what the fuck is going on.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.805
Call me. Please.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.784
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.218
Dr. Green's office.

06:04.563 --> 06:07.794
- Dr. Green?
- Yeah.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.996
- He's good.
- The best.

06:11.036 --> 06:12.970
Johnny Chase?

06:15.441 --> 06:18.842
I'm just getting
my girlfriend something.

06:18.877 --> 06:20.868
- As a gift.
- Oh, you have a girlfriend?

06:20.913 --> 06:22.642
Yeah.

06:22.681 --> 06:24.273
That's too bad.

06:28.654 --> 06:32.055
So, tell me, Mr. Chase, why are you
interested in calf augmentation?

06:32.091 --> 06:34.252
Well, Doc,
I've always felt top heavy.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.022
Out of proportion.

06:36.061 --> 06:39.326
You know, I work out every day
and they just don't grow.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.663
Well, we're all victims
of our genetic heritage.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.793
Yeah, well,
I was a double victim.

06:43.836 --> 06:47.567
We used to say about Pops,
"No child support and no calves."

06:47.606 --> 06:49.335
We can do it for you,
Mr. Chase.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.003
But it is something that you
have to be very be sure of,

06:52.044 --> 06:53.568
because this is
major surgery.

06:53.612 --> 06:55.944
Doc, I'm an actor
by trade.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.245
My legs
are my livelihood.

06:58.283 --> 07:00.877
You know,
I've got great thighs,

07:00.919 --> 07:02.546
very aesthetic knees.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.716
And I feel pretty good
about my ankles.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.022
It's just my calves
I can't live with.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.354
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure
I want to do it.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.559
Then I'll have Rita
schedule you in.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.568
Excellent.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.092
Thank you, Doc.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.832
Pleasure.

07:19.872 --> 07:23.933
Oh, Mr. Chase, the cost
of the operation will be $10,000.

07:24.943 --> 07:27.343
Do you take
S.A.G. Insurance?

07:27.379 --> 07:29.813
This is Michael
and Catherine's living room.

07:29.848 --> 07:32.146
Oh, did they fight
over that rug.

07:32.184 --> 07:35.244
Catherine's got all the T-mobile money
coming in right now.

07:35.287 --> 07:37.278
- Bet she won, huh?
- Exactly.

07:37.322 --> 07:39.119
Brad and Jen's master bath.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.616
Heartbreaking, although I heard
they might be getting back together.

07:42.661 --> 07:45.687
Carrie, you have any pictures
of Jen in the tub?

07:45.731 --> 07:48.666
How 'bout I tell Brad Pitt
that you said that, Turtle?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.861
- He'll kick your fuckin' ass.
- Please.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.804
I don't think you get where
we come from, okay, Shauna?

07:53.839 --> 07:55.932
I will slap Brad Pitt
in his face.

07:55.974 --> 07:58.704
I don't know, Brad looked pretty
ripped in "Troy."

07:58.744 --> 08:00.268
That's all C.G.I., Drama.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.246
They're gonna make Vince look
ripped up in "Aquaman."

08:02.281 --> 08:04.613
- Thanks, Turtle.
- David Schwimmer's kitchen.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.642
Notice the accents
in the marble and the full line

08:07.686 --> 08:10.416
- of Miele ovens and ranges.
- Mieles are awesome, Vince.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.550
They go from 0-400Â°
in four seconds.

08:13.592 --> 08:17.084
And they have a roast probe,
which is nice to have.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.893
How have we lived this long
without a roast probe?

08:19.932 --> 08:23.026
Look, Vince, the point with the house
is that it's yours.

08:23.068 --> 08:26.435
And I work 24 hours a day, seven days
a week to make sure it feels that way.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.940
- Sounds good. Let's do it.
- All right.

08:28.974 --> 08:31.636
- What do you charge?
- It's a $150,000 retainer.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.645
And then I get
10% of all purchases.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.113
But I also get 20% off
all purchases.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.308
So really, you're coming
out 10% ahead.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.909
- That sounds fair. You take a check?
- Of course.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.386
Actually, we're a little
low on cash flow right now.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.220
- Maybe if there's...
- We're waiting for money to come in.

08:46.258 --> 08:49.284
Big money, Carrie. You're gonna
be doing Aquaman's house.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.057
Ooh, fancy.

08:51.096 --> 08:54.031
We should get you guys an aquarium then.
I know the best place.

08:54.066 --> 08:57.365
It's fine. We can get started.
I know you're good for the money.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.240
Come on, Chris,
I painted your house for you.

09:03.275 --> 09:05.140
You stiffed me three grand.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.908
I would have forgotten about it
but I need the money right now.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.245
You begged me
to paint my house, Drama,

09:11.283 --> 09:14.377
and you fucked it up so bad
I had to pay somebody else to redo it,

09:14.419 --> 09:17.286
and I still gave you $2,500
'cause I'm a generous guy!

09:17.322 --> 09:19.552
Come on, Chris, we had a deal.
Don't make me beg.

09:19.591 --> 09:21.752
What do you need this money for?
You in trouble?

09:21.793 --> 09:24.023
No no, it's nothing
like that.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.731
- It's elective surgery.
- What are you getting your nose done?

09:28.767 --> 09:31.361
No, implants.

09:31.403 --> 09:34.566
- Calf implants.
- You're sicker than I thought.

09:34.606 --> 09:36.369
You gonna give me
the money or not?

09:36.408 --> 09:38.808
Yeah, I'll give you
the money for a shrink.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.978
You know what, fat boy?
I'll tell you what.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.880
How 'bout I come in
there, I beat your ass

09:44.917 --> 09:46.407
and then you give me
the money.

09:46.451 --> 09:48.214
You're looking slow
in there, Chris.

09:48.253 --> 09:51.347
You beat my ass
I'll give you the money.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.857
All right.

09:54.526 --> 09:57.723
I gotta warn you, Chris, I'm in the best
shape of my life right now.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.561
You know every time we get
in the ring together

10:00.599 --> 10:02.533
you end up
gettin' busted up.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.208
Dana Gordon,
you made Junior VP

10:10.242 --> 10:12.210
and I gotta wait three days
for a call back?

10:12.244 --> 10:15.338
Sorry, Ari, we were moving offices.
You know how it is.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.143
Where's the Vinny Chase offer?

10:17.182 --> 10:19.446
- What are you...
- Dana?

10:19.484 --> 10:21.475
Are you taking
a piss, Ari?

10:23.021 --> 10:25.489
That check you wrote me
isn't going to bounce, is it?

10:25.524 --> 10:28.049
No. I'd wait till Thursday
to cash it, though.

10:28.093 --> 10:30.789
- Excuse me?
- I'm kidding. It's fine.

10:31.997 --> 10:34.625
It is calming.

10:34.666 --> 10:38.500
You know, Vince, Oscar De La Hoya has
a shark in his house.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.596
Aquaman should
have one in his.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.072
Yeah.
How much, Keith?

10:42.107 --> 10:44.940
That guy right there is $6,500,
but he's a mutt.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.571
You want a purebred White Tip,
it'll cost you around $11,000.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.547
Maybe we should get two,
so they have a friend?

10:49.581 --> 10:51.071
Definitely, man!
Look at that.

10:51.116 --> 10:53.016
- What do you think, E?
- About what?

10:53.051 --> 10:55.076
Getting a couple sharks
for the house?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.850
- Well, how much is a shark?
- 11 grand.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.754
You really think we need
a shark, Vince?

10:59.791 --> 11:03.318
Yes, we do, E! And we should consider
gettin' some lobsters, too.

11:03.362 --> 11:06.763
We get bored with 'em, Drama can throw
'em in that new oven we're getting.

11:06.798 --> 11:09.392
It's Ari.
I'm gonna take this.

11:09.434 --> 11:12.494
As much as I'd love to spend the rest
of my day with you guys, I must go.

11:12.537 --> 11:14.801
I've got to drag Russell Crowe
out of Tom Bergin's.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.808
He's got "Leno" tonight.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.776
- See you.
- Ciao, beautiful.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.573
Ciao.

11:20.612 --> 11:23.308
- What's up, Ari?
- Just had lunch with Dana Gordon.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.873
- What'd she say?
- Everything's going to be great.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.351
Boss is in France.
He just has to sign off on the details.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.548
- You believe her?
- I've known her a very long time.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.386
Just stay calm.
We're gonna be okay.

11:32.424 --> 11:36.019
I will be calm when Vince has that check
in his hands, okay, Ari?

11:37.062 --> 11:39.257
Neurotic Irish fuck.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.929
Here's your left implant!

11:46.972 --> 11:48.496
Here's your right implant!

11:48.540 --> 11:51.634
Left! Right!

11:51.677 --> 11:54.441
And by the way,
I'm going to lose this weight,

11:54.479 --> 11:56.379
but you're never going
to get smart.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.280
Ask your fucking brother
for the money.

11:58.317 --> 12:01.616
All right, Chris.
How about half the money?

12:01.653 --> 12:04.019
I'm not just talking
about the fish.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.924
I mean, to spend $50,000 on a tank
is insane. We don't even have a couch.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.519
This morning this guy was
all for making the house nice.

12:10.562 --> 12:12.359
We'll just wait
for Carrie's discount.

12:12.397 --> 12:15.195
- She gets a discount on fish?
- Shauna says she's the best.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.531
I think she gets a discount
on everything.

12:17.569 --> 12:19.901
Hell, what the fuck
happened to you?

12:19.938 --> 12:21.735
I just worked out
with Chris Penn.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.536
Why do you always
work out with him?

12:23.575 --> 12:27.534
- You catch a beating every time.
- No, this is nothing.

12:27.579 --> 12:30.946
Look, bro, you know
I'd never ask you for anything,

12:30.982 --> 12:34.418
but I'm in dire need
of 10 grand.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.944
Drama, it's just
now's not a good time.

12:36.988 --> 12:38.751
Vince has a lot
of expenses right now.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.280
Is your name Vince?

12:40.325 --> 12:42.520
Look, I've exhausted
all available options.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.791
You know I'd never come
to you for money.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.559
And you know I'd never
say no to you.

12:46.598 --> 12:49.032
But, Johnny,
this is insane.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.659
This is my life!

12:50.702 --> 12:52.761
Are these things gonna
feel like fake tits?

12:52.804 --> 12:55.534
- I'm not in the mood, Turtle.
- I'm just asking a question.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.235
You think girls sit
around like us,

12:57.275 --> 12:59.368
"You like a guy with
real calves or fake calves?"

12:59.411 --> 13:01.242
As long as you go
underneath the muscle,

13:01.279 --> 13:03.213
like with tits,
they have a natural feel.

13:03.248 --> 13:05.307
So you've felt
a man's fake calf before?

13:05.350 --> 13:07.318
- Ugh!
- Uh, listen Johnny.

13:07.352 --> 13:09.479
I'll think about it,
all right?

13:10.622 --> 13:13.420
- Vince.
- Yeah?

13:13.458 --> 13:15.221
You know I love you,
right, bro?

13:15.260 --> 13:16.784
I know. I know.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.926
Oh yeah.
Sweet sweet sweet.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.129
Yeah, we could drop
some serious coin in this place.

13:24.169 --> 13:26.603
God, I hate shopping.

13:26.638 --> 13:28.936
Hmm.
This is kind of comfy.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.135
I could take a nap
right here.

13:31.176 --> 13:34.475
Now that is the couch
of a movie star if I've ever seen one.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.481
Josh Weinstein.
What's going on, man?

13:36.515 --> 13:38.710
Hey, Sundance, baby!
We did it.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.514
Don't forget, Josh Weinstein's the one
that found you that script.

13:41.553 --> 13:43.020
- We remember.
- Great.

13:43.054 --> 13:44.681
This is my girl Ima.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.953
Did three episodes
of "North Shore" last year.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.927
We're movin' in together.
Might even buy the same couch as you.

13:51.596 --> 13:53.621
Okay, baby.
Go check out a lamp, okay?

13:53.665 --> 13:56.566
- Seriously.
- Nice to meet you.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.705
So, guys,
congrats on J.C.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.502
That's a big score.

14:02.541 --> 14:06.272
I mean, I love "Aquaman," but I didn't
think they could land a whale like that.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.711
- What are you talking about?
- J.C., baby.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.045
James Cameron's directing
"Aquaman."

14:11.082 --> 14:14.609
What, you guys didn't know?
Ari is slackin'.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.111
Well, just remember Josh
Weinstein told you first.

14:22.961 --> 14:26.158
Yo, James Cameron, baby.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.428
This could be the worst
piece-of-shit movie ever,

14:28.467 --> 14:30.332
and it'll still make
a billion dollars.

14:30.368 --> 14:32.461
I would give my left arm
to do a Cameron movie.

14:32.504 --> 14:35.234
- How 'bout your left calf?
- Do you think it's true?

14:35.273 --> 14:36.900
I don't know.
I can't find Ari.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.536
You are on fire, E.
It's crazy.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.445
You read these things and you can
never guess what it's gonna be.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.278
But with a guy like James Cameron,

14:44.316 --> 14:46.614
you know it's gonna be special.
I'm gonna call Ari again.

14:48.019 --> 14:49.486
Ari Gold's office.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.046
Lloyd, it's Eric Murphy.
I need to talk to Ari.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.456
Eric, he told me
if I disturbed him,

14:54.493 --> 14:56.688
he'd chop me up
Benihana style.

14:56.728 --> 14:59.697
This is the most important phone call
you've ever had. I promise you.

14:59.731 --> 15:02.894
Do you how many times I've told him
I'm Chinese? The man does not listen.

15:02.934 --> 15:05.232
I don't care if he's in the middle
of open heart surgery.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.534
- Get him on the phone!
- Okay, fine, E.

15:07.572 --> 15:09.802
But it's just because you are

15:09.841 --> 15:12.469
the only nice person
in this whole fucking town!

15:12.511 --> 15:14.445
Thanks, Lloyd.

15:14.479 --> 15:16.845
I would have to say
it's his anger.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.442
I mean, he goes
from zero to 100 in a second flat.

15:19.484 --> 15:20.951
- Come on.
- Do you feel this is

15:20.986 --> 15:24.149
- an accurate assessment, Ari?
- No. I'm a very calm guy.

15:24.189 --> 15:26.487
I mean, whether it's... that's...

15:28.493 --> 15:31.087
I'm a very calm person,
all right?

15:31.129 --> 15:33.996
Whether I'm at work
or in a social situation,

15:34.032 --> 15:35.863
I am extremely calm.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.766
But my wife,
who I love very dearly,

15:37.802 --> 15:39.770
uh, she likes to nag,

15:39.804 --> 15:42.068
and I react to the nagging.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.768
Overreact.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.939
Sometimes,
okay, maybe.

15:49.981 --> 15:52.006
But without the nagging,

15:52.050 --> 15:53.813
no reaction.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.877
Well, what he
calls "nagging,"

15:55.921 --> 15:57.821
I call trying to have
a relationship.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.416
Look, there's
no proverbial judge

16:00.458 --> 16:03.086
sitting on
a bench judging you.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.119
Ari, I told you
to turn that off.

16:05.163 --> 16:07.427
I did turn it off, but this
is the emergency line.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.695
- This is the Bat Line.
- Do you need to get that?

16:09.734 --> 16:12.134
- I do need to take this, yes.
- No, he doesn't.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.139
I ask for one hour out of a day
for his undivided attention,

16:15.173 --> 16:17.937
- and I can't even have that.
- You can have it if you want to live

16:17.976 --> 16:20.240
in Agoura fucking Hills
and go to group therapy.

16:20.278 --> 16:22.974
But if you want a Beverly Hills mansion
and a country club membership

16:23.014 --> 16:24.641
and nine weeks a year
at a Tuscan villa,

16:24.683 --> 16:27.174
then I'm gonna need to take a call
when it comes in at noon

16:27.218 --> 16:29.379
on a motherfucking Wednesday!

16:29.421 --> 16:31.013
See, that's it.
There it is.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.184
You know what?
I have to take this.

16:36.494 --> 16:39.986
There better be a Scud missile heading
towards Beverly Hills, Eric.

16:40.031 --> 16:41.692
No, there's a fucking iceberg, Ari.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.702
- What?
- James Cameron's directing "Aquaman"!

16:44.736 --> 16:46.931
Fuck you.
Where'd you hear that? Friendster?

16:46.972 --> 16:49.065
No, I heard it
from Josh Weinstein, you jerkoff.

16:49.107 --> 16:52.474
Now get your hand off your dick
and go call somebody.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.375
I don't care if he's
in the Arctic Shelf.

16:54.412 --> 16:57.040
Get James Cameron on the phone!
Get Dana Gordon on the phone!

16:57.082 --> 16:59.175
Tell her assistant
if she does not call me back,

16:59.217 --> 17:01.549
I will fuck her worse
than I did in Cabo in '92.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.384
- Do you really want me to say that?
- Improvise, Lloyd.

17:04.422 --> 17:07.084
I'm gonna be there in 90 seconds.
Find out who covers Warner's.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.717
If all this is not taken care of

17:08.760 --> 17:11.092
I will choke you out
with a strap-on!

17:11.128 --> 17:14.155
See you when you get here.
Potty-mouth.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.362
James Cameron is not in.
Dana Gordon is not in.

17:19.404 --> 17:21.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Peter Cole covers Warner.

17:21.172 --> 17:22.833
- Who?
- Peter Cole.

17:22.874 --> 17:25.172
- Where's Mr. Cole's fucking office?
- That way.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.702
Call Gordon and Cameron every
five minutes until someone picks up!

17:28.747 --> 17:31.682
Cole?! Where is Mr. Fucking
Peter Cole's office?

17:31.716 --> 17:33.911
Cole? Where the fuck
is Peter Cole's office?

17:33.952 --> 17:35.817
- Right there.
- Right here?

17:36.888 --> 17:39.254
James Cameron
is directing "Aquaman"?

17:39.290 --> 17:40.814
That's great.
That's awesome.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.554
"That's awesome," huh?

17:42.594 --> 17:45.563
You didn't think to bring
it up in the fucking staff meeting?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.827
An e-mail?
A yellow fucking sticky something?

17:47.866 --> 17:50.391
I didn't know I was supposed
to know that kind of stuff.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.630
What is it you're supposed
to know, do you think?

17:52.671 --> 17:54.104
What the fuck
do we pay you for?

17:54.139 --> 17:55.697
To get your agency card laminated

17:55.740 --> 17:58.334
so you can go to Shelter
and try to fuck Mischa Barton?

17:58.376 --> 18:00.344
- I didn't think...
- Let me tell you something.

18:00.378 --> 18:02.073
You don't have to say anything.
You know why?

18:02.113 --> 18:04.411
'Cause you pick up
all your stuff

18:04.449 --> 18:06.781
because you're
motherfucking fired!

18:13.191 --> 18:15.625
- What happened?
- I don't know.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.992
I was dropping off Peter's mail

18:18.029 --> 18:20.122
and then Mr. Gold fired me.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.156
My life is over.

18:26.671 --> 18:28.366
I've got Dana Gordon
on the phone.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.505
Is it true?

18:37.549 --> 18:41.007
Ari, listen, I couldn't say anything,
okay? We were negotiating.

18:41.052 --> 18:44.112
Did you tell Jimbo Vincent Chase
is attached to this project?

18:44.155 --> 18:47.147
- It's all gonna be fine.
- Don't fuck me, Dana!

18:47.192 --> 18:50.628
Who got you that job?
Who pulled you out of accounting?

18:50.662 --> 18:52.857
Okay, Ari, listen to me,
all right?

18:52.897 --> 18:55.764
I'm gonna tell you this,
but if you tell anyone that I told you

18:55.800 --> 18:58.530
- I will deny it until my death.
- All right.

18:58.570 --> 19:02.666
Alan and Jim are in Paris right now,
and as soon as they are done,

19:02.707 --> 19:04.607
- they will take care of Vince.
- Uh-huh.

19:04.642 --> 19:07.873
And, Ari, listen.
Alan loves Vince, okay?

19:07.912 --> 19:11.006
His 14-year-old daughter has
Vince posters all over her walls.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.778
We're all good.

19:14.018 --> 19:16.111
Dana, I love you.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.952
And if I wasn't married,
I'd take you back to Cabo with me.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.550
Yeah, it wasn't Cabo, Ari.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.959
It was a Red Roof Inn
in Rosarito.

19:23.995 --> 19:25.860
It sure felt like Cabo
to me, Dana.

19:25.897 --> 19:27.387
Goodbye!

19:27.432 --> 19:29.491
Bye.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.466
Hey, Lloyd, get in here.
I want to make out with you!

19:33.505 --> 19:34.972
Coming.

19:51.623 --> 19:55.855
Hey, Vince, you wanna tell these cunts
that I'm with you?

19:55.894 --> 19:57.828
Is this guy with you, Vince?

19:57.862 --> 20:00.490
This guy's gonna win Sundance
for the second time this year.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.397
Billy Walsh.
You don't know him?

20:02.433 --> 20:04.958
- Well, alrighty then, Mr. Walsh.
- Let him in.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.470
Enjoy your evening.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.050
Come on, guys.
Yo, Ari, the boys are here.

20:20.084 --> 20:22.314
Hey, hey.
Is anybody on time anymore?

20:22.353 --> 20:23.980
- What's up, baby?
- Whoo-hoo!

20:24.022 --> 20:26.286
There he is, Mr. Walsh.
Congratulations, my friend.

20:26.324 --> 20:27.621
Oh, great!
Another suit.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.627
Suit Number One,
sit with Suit Number Two.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.652
Great, he can direct us, huh?

20:33.531 --> 20:35.396
Congratulations, Billy.

20:35.433 --> 20:38.231
Hey, Skirt Suit,
move over would you?

20:38.269 --> 20:40.999
- Let me get in next to the models.
- Asshole!

20:41.039 --> 20:44.475
Billy, am I gonna be happy
with myself in the cut?

20:45.844 --> 20:48.074
Happiness is a state
of mind, Johnny.

20:48.112 --> 20:50.740
Now let me get your place.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.546
I like your girl better, okay?
Move over. Come on.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.985
You hear anything?

20:56.020 --> 20:58.682
- It's all good.
- No, it's not all good.

20:58.723 --> 21:01.283
Vince hired a decorator
today for a $150,000.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.726
- Oh yeah, who'd you get?
- Carrie Carlson.

21:03.761 --> 21:06.491
- She's good. She's expensive.
- What are you, an asshole?

21:06.531 --> 21:09.295
No, I'm the guy that just got you
that James Cameron movie.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.666
Do not fuck with me, Ari.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.295
Just talked to the studio.

21:13.338 --> 21:16.273
They're wrapping him up then
they're gonna wrap us up.

21:16.307 --> 21:19.765
I wanted to wait to tell you so you
could grab the glory and tell your boy.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.245
- You wanna hug it out? Come here.
- Yeah!

21:23.581 --> 21:25.378
Vince, Cameron's in!

21:25.416 --> 21:27.407
We're doing
a James Cameron movie!

21:27.452 --> 21:30.387
Wow!
That's truly amazing!

21:30.421 --> 21:32.446
Holy shit.
Yo, Johnny!

21:32.490 --> 21:34.458
- Yo!
- I think it's retarded,

21:34.492 --> 21:36.483
but if you want
to do your legs, you got it.

21:36.527 --> 21:39.553
- What are you doing to your legs?
- Nothing.

21:39.597 --> 21:43.260
Thanks, bro, but could we talk
about that later please.

21:43.301 --> 21:46.236
I wanna say something!
Everybody grab a glass!

21:46.271 --> 21:48.034
See this guy right here?

21:48.072 --> 21:49.869
See that guy right there!

21:49.908 --> 21:51.876
Nobody believed in them.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.878
I did.
And it paid off.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.641
And we believed
in you, Vince.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.545
And that really
paid off, baby.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.982
To Sundance and beyond!

22:00.018 --> 22:01.849
Thank you!

22:03.121 --> 22:05.851
Yo, Eric, if you guys
wanna move on down,

22:05.890 --> 22:08.518
it seems a little crowded,
you can take over Leo's table.

22:08.559 --> 22:11.187
- Why? He's not coming in?
- No no.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.288
Leo went to Paris
to talk to James Cameron

22:13.331 --> 22:14.992
about some fish movie.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.269
We are so fucked.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.333
We are so fucking fucked.

22:26.305 --> 22:32.554
