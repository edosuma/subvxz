in their hands.

Uh, Utah? Respectfully,
may I ask,

07:16.914 --> 07:19.308
what does this case
have to do with us?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.614
KILBRIDE:
Valid question.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.442
This was private land.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.400
Now, after the rangers found
the dead bodies,

07:24.531 --> 07:26.184
they went to
the cabin's owner

07:26.315 --> 07:28.883
Weber Yamada
and found him dead.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.146
There were personal items
at the cabin

07:31.276 --> 07:32.713
belonging to Tom Olsen.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.585
Sam's friend Tom Olsen
from the teams?

07:35.716 --> 07:39.502
Yeah. It seems
these shooters came after him.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.331
Tom took two of them out and
then disappeared into the woods.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.028
I was put on the case

07:44.159 --> 07:45.552
because Justice wants to know
who these guys are.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.293
Got in a shoot-out
with an ex-team guy,

07:48.424 --> 07:51.122

on any of our databases.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.472
Okay.

07:52.602 --> 07:53.951
Do we think that this might have

07:54.082 --> 07:55.431
something to do with
his writing career?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.607
Well, Tom does have
a pretty large public persona

07:57.738 --> 07:59.653
due to his fiction career
taking off,

07:59.783 --> 08:02.699
but his publishers say that
there's been no signs of

08:02.830 --> 08:04.701
a threat or
any security issues.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.095
And this is all happening
in real time,

08:07.225 --> 08:10.315
but it looks like the rangers
found boot prints following Tom,

08:10.446 --> 08:12.230
so he's not in the clear.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.930
KILBRIDE:
After he left the teams,
Tom went to work for the CIA.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.673
He crossed paths many times
with Vostanik Sabatino.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.434
What kind of a dog
is Francis?

11:38.523 --> 11:39.960
He's a Rottweiler.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.397
You have a Rottweiler
named Francis.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.965
Badass.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.754
I can't see myself
dating another woman.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.539
Not...
Not right now.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.934
It just doesn't seem like
the right thing to do.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.157
Yeah.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.376
Colonel Tuivasa,
what do you got?

12:05.507 --> 12:08.205
No one at SOCOM
or JSOC had an issue

12:08.336 --> 12:10.033
with Lieutenant Olsen's
works of fiction.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.775
If anything, lot of the guys
read his books and dig 'em.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.037
[chuckles]
Understood.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.952
Uh, what about specific threats

12:16.083 --> 12:18.215
or chatter about Tom
or his team?

12:18.346 --> 12:19.913
I've got intel
scrubbing for that now,

12:20.043 --> 12:22.393
but there was nothing found
in our prelim search.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.743
Keep me posted.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.223
You'll be my first call,
Admiral.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.834
Got to think that
after the teams

12:27.964 --> 12:28.878
and then his stint at the CIA,

12:29.009 --> 12:31.228
there's some enemies out there.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.796
You're probably not wrong.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.452
Back in the day, team guys
would stay low profile

12:37.582 --> 12:40.237
when they rotated back
into the civilian sector.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.370
Things are a little
different these days.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.024
Can't blame the guys
for wanting to earn a living

12:44.154 --> 12:45.460
when they get out.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.418
No. No, you can't.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.551
Although I am very happy
that no one

12:49.681 --> 12:52.293
in the Twitter-Tok universe
knows who the hell I am.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.034
Roger that.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.950
Now, thank you, Colonel.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.386
Thank you, Admiral.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.389
[hang-up chime]

13:02.651 --> 13:03.695
Hey, guys.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.567
Hey.This is Lauren Olsen.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.570
Thanks for driving
her down, Castor.My pleasure.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.267
Go ahead.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.617
Ms. Olsen,
I'm Special Agent Namazi,

13:12.748 --> 13:15.969
this is Special Deputy
U.S. Marshal Sabatino.

13:16.099 --> 13:19.799
So we know that there was
an attempt made on Tom's life

13:19.929 --> 13:21.539
in Utah early this morning.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.455
All signs point to him
still being alive.

13:24.586 --> 13:25.413
He is.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.197
Why do you say that?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.330
'Cause she knows what
her husband is capable of.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.073
Tom's comfortable
in the South Valley.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.901
He's got home-field
advantage there.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.427
With, um, all
of Tom's success

13:39.557 --> 13:42.256
and the publicity
that comes with that,

13:42.386 --> 13:45.259
were there
any security risks

13:45.389 --> 13:47.000
or threats that
you were aware of?

13:48.088 --> 13:49.437
No...

13:49.567 --> 13:52.788
All Tom ever wanted to do
was write stories.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.312
We're so blessed that he's
even able to make a dollar

13:55.443 --> 13:58.620
being able to do
what he loves. But...

13:58.750 --> 14:00.361
What is it?

14:01.623 --> 14:04.060
He battled with this
career choice every day.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.889
Tom didn't want to do
any of the publicity,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.544
the interviews,
the YouTube shows.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.459
He just wanted to write.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.941
But that's not how
the book business works.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.074
You got to be a publicity
machine these days.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.164
Was he worried
that the notoriety

14:21.295 --> 14:23.166
would cause him danger?

14:23.297 --> 14:26.169
Tom didn't care
if anyone came after him.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.172
But, me and Robbie,
our boy...

14:29.303 --> 14:32.349
There's not much
my husband is scared of,

14:32.480 --> 14:35.787
but someone attacking us,
that terrified him.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.878
We'll take you and Robbie
to a safe house

14:39.008 --> 14:40.836
until we figure out
who's trying to hurt Tom.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.752
We got people headed to Utah
right now to locate him.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
LAUREN:
Roger that.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.672
[Kilbride sighs]

14:50.802 --> 14:53.631
Sir.We got no threats,
no suspects,

14:53.762 --> 14:57.984
and no idea why two shooters
came after a decorated veteran

14:58.114 --> 15:00.290
this morning.Yeah.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.944
All right.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.077
If we can't figure
out the why,

15:04.207 --> 15:05.513
we need a better answer
for the who.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.950
I want to know everything
about these two shooters

15:08.081 --> 15:09.517
Tom took out.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.823
I've got names, but they're
tied to coroner records

15:11.954 --> 15:12.824
from five years ago.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.304
So they're not real.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.827
Well, you find out
who these bastards are

15:15.958 --> 15:17.655
'cause right now
they're all we've got.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.527
Yes, sir.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.707
All right.
Should be there soon.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.579
Did I tell you that I read
all four of Tom Olsen's books?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.625
LANCE:
So, were they good?They're awesome.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.235
I mean, because he
actually lived the life,

15:32.366 --> 15:33.802
you know, he doesn't
write superheroes,

15:33.933 --> 15:36.196
he writes real characters,
they get scared, they get hurt.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.241
They're great.
You should read them.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.244
I'm more of a "wait till it
gets to the movie" kind of guy.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.376
[chuckles]
Of course you are.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.204
Yeah.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.162
All right.
Let's see here, um...

15:47.947 --> 15:49.992
Locals were only able
to track Tom's footprints

15:50.123 --> 15:52.734
for about 20 yards
from the point of conflict,

15:52.864 --> 15:54.910
and then he disappears.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.869
Which I guess makes sense,
since Darren McCall was trained

15:58.000 --> 15:59.219
by an expert tracker and scout

15:59.349 --> 16:00.829
in Colorado when
he was a kid. [laughs]

16:00.960 --> 16:02.570
And who's Darren McCall?

16:02.700 --> 16:05.051
He's the lead character
in every one of Tom's books.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.532
And he writes about his skill
with such detail

16:08.663 --> 16:11.927
and expertise that what
Darren knows, Tom knows.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.102
Makes sense.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.930
[beep]

16:15.061 --> 16:17.019
Oh, no...

16:18.803 --> 16:20.588
Rangers just found

16:20.718 --> 16:22.982
four separate boot tracks
going after Tom.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.028
Four against one.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.509
Looks like Tom's in
for one hell of a fight.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.553
Yep.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.252
So are we.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.353
You guys really need
to swap out these magazines.

16:46.483 --> 16:47.789
Nobody cares what the car
of the year was

16:47.919 --> 16:51.227
in 2009.I care.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
That was the year I got
my driver's license.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.145
Oh, geez.
I have jeans as old as you.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.451
Well, you're in luck,

16:57.581 --> 16:59.322
'cause those jeans
are back in style.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.889
[door opens]

17:02.847 --> 17:04.675
Hey, guys.Hey.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.113
This is Marina...
I didn't catch your last name.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.984
MARINA:
I didn't throw it.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.117
That's okay, Castor.
Marina and I go way back.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.641
[Sabatino grunts]

17:13.771 --> 17:15.382
FATIMA:Whoa!

17:15.512 --> 17:17.339
That was for Kyoto.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.951
[groans] Hey, I didn't know
you were in that store.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.127
Didn't know or didn't care?

17:22.258 --> 17:23.999
I'm just gonna lay here
for a second.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.740
Does anybody like you,
Sabatino?

17:25.869 --> 17:26.958
Mm...
Third wife?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.960
I'm Marina.[groaning]

17:29.091 --> 17:30.397
Hi. Special Agent Namazi.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.051
Good to meet you.

17:32.181 --> 17:35.141
So, you worked with
Tom at the Agency?Yeah.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.446
And this moron.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.014
Hey, don't make me stand.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
After your office told me
what happened to Tom,

17:41.234 --> 17:42.844
I had our team do
some digging.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.194
I'm sure your team is
very good at that digging.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.588
So, not specifying how
we got our information,

17:47.718 --> 17:50.156
but there was a credible
threat at a book signing

17:50.286 --> 17:51.766
in Huntington Beach
last month.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.726
The guy was diverted by security
before Tom got to the signing.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.772
It's doubtful that Tom
even knew that it happened.

17:57.902 --> 17:58.947
Did you get a name?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.079
Ah, my foot hurts.Luke Austin.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.732
[grunts, sighs]

18:01.863 --> 18:05.084
As always, you are a pleasure
to deal with, Marina,

18:05.214 --> 18:06.868
and a little ray of sunshine.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.174
You want me
to spit on you?

18:08.304 --> 18:11.699
Well, it's official.
You miss me.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.135
She misses me.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.311
Seems like it.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.881
[knocks on door]Enter.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.057
Sir, Kensi and Lance
just landed in Utah.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.667
They're on their way
to the crime scene now.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.191
What about that guy

18:25.321 --> 18:27.541
who was removed from
Tom Olsen's book signing?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.195
Luke Austin.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.588
I was able to locate him, and...

18:31.719 --> 18:33.851
Sabatino and Fatima are
on their way to talk to him now.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.288
I made them aware that he has

18:35.418 --> 18:38.247
four handguns
and an AR-15 registered.

18:38.378 --> 18:41.816
Well, then he's not a felon yet.
Anything else?

18:41.946 --> 18:44.253
Well, his social media
is pretty heavy

18:44.384 --> 18:45.776
on the guns
and motorcycle clubs.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.300
Is he a member?

18:47.430 --> 18:48.736
Doesn't look like it,

18:48.866 --> 18:51.042
and he doesn't even have
a motorcycle license.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.828
But I'm running a search now
to see if any of those clubs

18:53.958 --> 18:56.222
ever called out Tom or any
of his books on social media.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.136
All right,

18:57.266 --> 18:59.529
smart, and send me that VP

18:59.660 --> 19:02.315
at the publishing company's
number, um...

19:02.445 --> 19:04.404
Copy that,
her name's Kelsey Shore.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.884
Yeah, well, I want to ask
Kelsey why she withheld

19:07.015 --> 19:09.626
this information
on Luke Austin.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.237
Yes, sir.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.155
Okay, so...

19:16.285 --> 19:17.460
they found Tom's pack outrig

19:17.591 --> 19:20.202
filled with deer meat
and nothing else.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.770
They also found
two automatic rifles.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.468
Local lab looked at them--
no fingerprints, but get this--

19:25.599 --> 19:27.775
the frames and receivers
had no serial numbers.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.081
Ghost guns.Yeah. Untraceable.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.605
You?
What'd you figure out?

19:31.735 --> 19:33.911
Tom put up
one hell of a fight.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.610
Takes the first guy down
with his bow over here.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.916
Then he retreats
to cover position,

19:39.047 --> 19:41.397
takes fire,
pulls out his handgun,

19:41.528 --> 19:44.487
then drops the second guy
down the hill.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.229
Then retreats to the east
through those bushes.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.275
So we're thinking he
disappeared through there?

19:49.405 --> 19:50.972
Yeah.
All right.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.279
Shall we?
After you.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.547
Austin works at
that hardware store.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.462
He should be off
any minute.Nice.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.507
Stop him before he gets
to his vehicle.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.509
You know, the odds are low
that he'll have his gun on him.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.033
Yeah, every once in a while,
I'll have a good idea.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.081
What?

20:14.474 --> 20:15.736
Nothing.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.261
What?
You're looking at me.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.916
It's-it's really nothing.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.267
Actually, okay.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.269
Everyone says that you
talk a mile a minute,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.271
and Kensi says that you're
straight up hilarious.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.795
She said that?Yeah, so what gives?

20:31.926 --> 20:33.667
You've barely
talked to me today,

20:33.797 --> 20:35.364
and I haven't heard you say
one hilarious thing,

20:35.495 --> 20:37.584
nothing even
borderline humorous.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.891
Well, you know, maybe those are
gross generalizations

20:41.022 --> 20:42.806
of who I was when I was
a younger man.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.548
Oh, from six months ago?Yeah, people can change.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.159
Okay. Fine.
Maybe it's just me.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.509
Maybe it is.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.563
You've got
no sense of humor.

No offense.
Some taken.

You know, everything's so
precious and serious and so,

[mumbling]: you can't
say that, you know?

Oh, come on.

from the NCIS HR lady.

good eye, you know,

things, they go in a file.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.585
Uh-huh.
What is that?

21:22.716 --> 21:24.065
I've had things put
in some magical file

21:24.195 --> 21:25.849
since I was ten years old.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.199

what's never happened?Career advancement?

got a sense of humor.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.425
So I can mess with you?
You can take it?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.471
Yeah, of course
I can take it.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.081
You know, something
you might not realize is,

21:40.211 --> 21:41.517
we're actually tougher
than you think.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.519
Okay, we get a lot
of hate coming at us.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.261

22:34.309 --> 22:35.571

Could be his

22:35.702 --> 22:37.617
or one of the guys
tracking him.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.619
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.106
LANCE:
Blood's still wet.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.544
Either way, somebody's been here
the last couple of hours.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.995
[sighs]

23:08.125 --> 23:09.475
That's B negative.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.520
That's Tom's blood type.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.958
That's rare.
Odds are our man's wounded.

23:15.089 --> 23:18.353
Well... let's make sure
we find him before they do.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.398

I'm Special Agent Namazi,
this is U.S. Marshal Sabatino.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.321
We need to ask you some
questions about Tom Olsen.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.975
Oh, my G...

23:32.106 --> 23:33.803
Did those rent-a-cops
at the book signing

23:33.934 --> 23:35.805
really run this up
the flagpole or something?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.504
Uh... no.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.244
Oh.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.898
Well, then what do you want
to know about Tom Olsen,

23:42.029 --> 23:43.247
that elitist, arrogant turd?

23:43.378 --> 23:44.771
What's your issue with Tom?

23:44.901 --> 23:47.251
[clucks tongue] Mainly
that he's a hack of a writer

23:47.382 --> 23:49.297
who cares nothing
about his loyal fan base

23:49.428 --> 23:51.386
that got him to where he is.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.605
So, this is about his books?

23:52.735 --> 23:55.869
Well, specifically
about Andre Gane.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.218
Who's Andre Gane?

23:57.348 --> 23:59.046
Oh, my God.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.700
You probably think that
the only character that matters

24:00.830 --> 24:02.441
is Darren McCall,

24:02.571 --> 24:05.705
but Andre is the moral compass
of the entire series.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.229
And Tom Olsen,
in his infinite wisdom,

24:08.359 --> 24:11.145
decides to just...
kill off Andre in Got My Six.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.321
So, you tried to
confront Tom

24:13.452 --> 24:15.062
because of the death
of this character?

24:15.192 --> 24:17.238
Mm-mm, no, confront
is a strong word.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.196
No, he's a Navy SEAL.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.894
No, I just wanted him to know

24:21.024 --> 24:22.548
that it was really not cool
to do Andre like that.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.201
Okay, so you weren't
trying to hurt him?

24:24.332 --> 24:25.768
Dude, look at me.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.422
Do you really think
I could hurt Tom Olsen?

24:27.553 --> 24:28.684
All right.
What's with all the guns?

24:28.815 --> 24:29.946
I like guns.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.731
That's not a crime yet, is it?

24:31.861 --> 24:33.384
No, it is not.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.604
Luke, have you left the
state in the past week?

24:35.735 --> 24:38.085
I haven't left Orange County
in, like, five years.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.348
Gotcha. Okay.
All right, we're good here.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.525
Yeah. Thank you.Well-- Actually, Austin.
You're 22, right?

24:43.656 --> 24:44.744
Yeah.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.485
So I'm trying to learn here.

24:46.615 --> 24:49.096
What's the beef between
your people and the millennials?

24:49.226 --> 24:52.186
You mean, why do we think
that an entire generation

24:52.316 --> 24:54.754
that identifies with specific
houses in Harry Potter

24:54.884 --> 24:56.016
is super annoying?

24:56.146 --> 24:58.453
Okay, wow.That's really funny.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.150
Yeah, I mean,
can they literally squeeze

25:00.281 --> 25:02.718
any more identifying words
into their Twitter bio?

25:02.849 --> 25:05.504
Yeah, yeah, they do use their
bio like it's their résumé.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.157
Yeah, but it's not
their fault.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.377

Tom was still able to get him.

from that hill and then moved.

Wish we had a way
to contact him

25:49.330 --> 25:51.332
and tell him we're here
to take him home safely.
