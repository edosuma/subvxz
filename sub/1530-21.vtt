00:00.960 --> 00:03.088
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.160 --> 00:05.527
- Ward is HYDRA.
- No, I don't believe it.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.409
You think I don't wanna
watch him suffer?

00:07.480 --> 00:08.527
Not suffer, die.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.171
Tell us how to unlock the drive.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.362
I start the hack,
and once we reach altitude, it unlocks.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.441
Now bring him back.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.409
These vials contain the raw materials

00:16.480 --> 00:20.041
of whatever Jesus juice brought
Coulson back from the dead.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.724
I can't succeed without your help.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.043
We'll need a base of operation,
weapons, tactical backup.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.282
There is no backup. It's over.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.044
There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.130
Grant Ward?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.849
My name's John Garrett.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.971
Quartermaster at your military
school is an old buddy of mine.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.808
Told me about a pissed-off young cadet

01:08.920 --> 01:10.649
with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination

01:10.720 --> 01:12.484
who went AWOL, stole a car,

01:12.560 --> 01:13.925
drove 1,000 miles home

01:14.000 --> 01:16.082
only to try and burn the place down.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.001
I must say, I find a young man
like that intriguing.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.844
I'm curious.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.165
Did you know your brother
was in the house

01:29.240 --> 01:30.924
when you set it on fire?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.403
No, sir, I did not.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.362
I was a pyro as a kid, too.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.444
Ended up making
a pretty good living at it.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.730
I'm here to make you
a one-time offer, so listen up.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.484
Your family's lawyer's gonna
be here in about 20 minutes.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.847
Not only are your folks
pressing charges against you

01:56.920 --> 01:58.490
for arson and attempted murder,

01:58.560 --> 02:00.449
but your older brother's
petitioning the court

02:00.520 --> 02:03.046
to have you tried as an adult.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.441
Now, you can spend
the next few years locked up in a cage,

02:05.560 --> 02:06.925
blaming Mommy and Daddy

02:07.000 --> 02:09.970
and mean older brother
for your problems,

02:10.039 --> 02:13.123
or you can let me get you out of here
and teach you how to be a man.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.924
I work for a secret organization

02:18.000 --> 02:20.651
that's always looking to recruit
young men like you.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.130
And why should I trust you?

02:23.200 --> 02:27.091
You shouldn't.
Don't trust anybody. Ever.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.810
Especially me.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.084
Let me be clear.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.690
Going with me will be the
hardest thing you've ever done.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.484
But, on the other hand,

02:38.560 --> 02:40.927
no one will ever screw with you again.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.084
Say yes. It'll be hard, but fun.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.087
Ten seconds and I walk out that door.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.764
Say yes.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.846
- Yes.
- Get down!

03:04.920 --> 03:06.684
Everybody, down! On the ground!

03:06.760 --> 03:08.444
Nobody move!

03:09.080 --> 03:11.162
I told you it was gonna be fun.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.530
Eye witnesses claim the assailant
smashed through several walls

03:18.600 --> 03:21.285
before killing Colombia's
most notorious drug lord,

03:21.360 --> 03:24.091
Alejandro Castillo, AKA El Dogo.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.449
Speculation continues as to whether
this superhuman assassination

03:28.560 --> 03:31.928
was carried out by a man,
monster, or machine.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.288
The correct answer is
all of the above.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.881
What the hell is Deathlok
doing in Bogotá?

03:38.960 --> 03:41.691
And why would he kill a drug lord
with known ties to HYDRA?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.885
Well, if they really are in Colombia,

03:43.960 --> 03:47.567
then Garrett and our hijacked plane
might not be in American airspace.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.324
- I have to expand our search.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.007
Guys, you wanna come in here
for a minute?

03:57.360 --> 04:00.682
This is just about everything
we've been dealing with.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.450
And this

04:05.440 --> 04:07.090
connects them all.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.801
Cybertek built Deathlok,
shipped items to Quinn,

04:10.880 --> 04:13.042
who was working for The Clairvoyant,

04:13.120 --> 04:14.929
who turned out to be Garrett,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.889
who planted Ward on our bus,

04:16.959 --> 04:20.089
because he wanted to know
why I didn't stay dead.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.970
Should've drawn another chart
for this part.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.087
No, I get it.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.441
Garrett's been developing
Centipede serum all this time.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.761
- Yes.
-And he wants GH-325

04:28.840 --> 04:30.524
as its final ingredient.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.763
A way to stabilize and regenerate
his Centipede soldiers.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.127
And it's why Ward came back
for the hard drive.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.646
It had all of your research
about Coulson and Skye.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.210
It's all on there.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.044
But that's not the only thing on there.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.565
Skye left them a little surprise.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.766
A Trojan horse.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.525
It's been slowly mapping every
system they've uploaded it to.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.642
That's brilliant. You can wake it up
and take over their systems.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.290
- A Trojan horse. Well done, Skye.
-Yeah. Thanks.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.361
Except, it doesn't work that way

04:52.440 --> 04:54.807
because I didn't
have enough time to build it,

04:54.880 --> 04:59.283
so we need to plug this
into one of their computers to activate it.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.562
Spoiler alert, we can't seem to find one.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.721
I think we have.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.485
Garrett and Cybertek have been
working together for years.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.971
If it's on Garrett's system...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.280
It's on Cybertek's.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.408
Which is why we're gonna go
into one of their offices.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.762
We have no authority to do this.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.683
We're no longer S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,
we're...

05:16.760 --> 05:18.364
We're vigilantes.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.487
I was gonna say,

05:19.560 --> 05:23.406
"Doing this because it's the
right thing to do," but, yeah.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.402
So, if you're with me,
I'm gonna finish what I started.

05:27.480 --> 05:31.166
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
Garrett and Ward get away with murder.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.410
And I want my plane back.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.605
I could've crossed off
that drug lord

05:36.680 --> 05:38.330
without getting my picture taken.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.204
Single shot, half a mile away.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.520
You're missing the point.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.649
I didn't want to just cross him off,
I wanted to make a spectacle.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.927
People are killed by guns
every day in Bogotá.

05:47.320 --> 05:51.962
But how often does a monster
punch a drug lord's head clean off?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.083
Hell, that's international news.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.970
Spectacular thing you did
back there, Mikey.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.405
If I didn't know better,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.370
I'd swear you were
starting to enjoy your job.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.442
You get the impression
he's enjoying his job?

06:03.520 --> 06:05.045
Somebody does.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.122
I'd like to think we all enjoy our work.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.447
And why not?
These are exciting times full of rewards.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.450
Which reminds me.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.842
--Zeller, yeah, it's me.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.485
Stream Mike Peterson some video
of his son this afternoon.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.849
--Don't mention it.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.567
How about that guy?
I've turned him into a new man.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.404
Is that what he is?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.482
Are you still sore
about what he did to you?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.767
No, I'm sore at you for making him do it.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.411
Look, we're on the verge
of completing something

06:37.480 --> 06:40.404
I've been chasing for 25 years.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.767
Can't you just be happy for me?

06:45.560 --> 06:49.281
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Happy campers.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.249
I think you'll be happy, too.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.482
We're close to replicating
the drug that healed Skye

06:53.600 --> 06:55.364
and brought Coulson back to life.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.091
And the data from Skye's hard drive,
all that research?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.161
It's been a big help.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.447
I've uploaded everything
to the lab in Cuba.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.363
They'll have initial results
by the time we land.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.966
You never disappoint, do you, Flowers?

07:06.040 --> 07:09.408
Wish everyone on my team
had the same success rate.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.600
Okay. We'll see you this afternoon.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.046
We're on with the R&D department
up at Cybertek's Palo Alto offices.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.287
It'll be okay, Fitz.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.521
No matter how deep they dig,

07:24.600 --> 07:26.602
they'll only find
the new identities I've created.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.481
It's not that. It's the idea of giving them
access to all of our designs.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.449
We're not actually
giving them anything.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.285
We just need to get inside
so we can plug Skye's flash drive

07:35.360 --> 07:37.249
into one of their computers.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.961
You don't have to go.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.327
It's not that, either.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.004
It's Ward.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.368
What if Garrett put an exploding eye
into him to control him?

07:46.440 --> 07:47.851
Maybe that's why he betrayed us.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.322
I'm pretty sure there's
a much simpler reason. He's evil.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.648
I don't believe that people are born evil.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.323
Something must've happened.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.604
Sorry it took so long.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.649
My mom's real sentimental

08:00.720 --> 08:02.961
about Grandad's
Howling Commando stuff.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.045
Now, Trip was generous
enough to offer up

08:05.120 --> 08:07.726
some of his granddad's
spy tech to help us out.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.320
We should systematically
take a full inventory of...

08:10.400 --> 08:14.041
Oh, my God!
Is that a handheld hypno-beam?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.248
One of the original betas.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.810
See how it has the switch
on the bottom?

08:17.880 --> 08:21.202
The production models moved it
to the side. This is amazing.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.682
- Almost as cool as a...
- Transistorized blast gun.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.531
Okay, the two
of you can get a room later,

08:29.600 --> 08:31.523
but we have a plane to catch.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.601
No.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.602
Where did they buy this stuff?
From the back of a comic book?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.206
Come on, girl,
that's not really a joy buzzer. That's a...

08:38.559 --> 08:39.721
EMP.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.768
Knocks power out
in about a 10-foot radius.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.207
Yeah. A lot of vintage
S.H.I.E.L.D. spy craft

08:44.280 --> 08:46.806
was designed to look innocent
in case the spy was caught.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.924
Like, okay...

08:49.120 --> 08:51.168
Like these smokes.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.566
Oh.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.682
Thanks, Trip.
This is a huge help.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.967
Gives us a fighting chance
against these bad guys.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.644
- Oh, Fitz.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.646
Watch out, HYDRA, here we come.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.881
I'm gonna retire out here one day.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.486
A thousand acres of
Wyoming woods and meadows,

09:18.560 --> 09:20.244
already paid for.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.891
Speak up, son. I'm not a mind reader.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.243
What if the police find us?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.243
Nobody's looking.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.970
Family would be happy
to never see you again.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.566
As for cops, well,

09:33.640 --> 09:35.927
they do best when they stay
out of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s way.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.288
So is S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy near here?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.283
Right now,
you have more pressing issues.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.442
Like what you're gonna eat tonight.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.925
I thought that was our dinner.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.810
No, this is my dinner.
I shot 'em, I eat 'em.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.645
Hell, Buddy deserves
these birds more than you do.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.131
He retrieved 'em.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.965
Out here, son, you want something,
you have to earn it.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.691
From here on out, you earn everything.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.127
You want a warm place to sleep,
you make it.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.645
You want something to eat, you kill it.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.609
Wait. You can't be serious.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.648
All I have in here are some clothes.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.768
All right. This isn't fair.
If you'd have told me,

10:07.840 --> 10:09.524
I'd have brought tools or food...

10:09.600 --> 10:11.443
Stop blaming me for your own failure.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.204
Makes me not like you.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.847
You want it easy? Go back to juvie.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.809
They'll give you
three squares and a cot.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.004
Confirm what your family believes,

10:21.080 --> 10:22.491
what everybody believes.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.410
That Grant Ward is weak and worthless.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.080
I'll tell you what. I'll leave Buddy here.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.441
You take care of him,
maybe he'll take care of you.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.330
I'll be back in a couple of months.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.722
Either you'll be here or you won't.
It's up to you.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.050
For what it's worth,

10:43.560 --> 10:45.847
- I believe you can do it.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.165
Hi. Welcome to Cybertek. Sit, please.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.168
I'm Ott, Senior VP of R&D. This is Diaz.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.402
I'm Theo Tittle, this is Dr. Roum.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.848
Thanks so much for seeing us
on such short notice.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.447
We've met with a number of other
former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists recently,

11:21.600 --> 11:25.241
and, I must say,
thus far we're underwhelmed.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.845
HYDRA, on the other hand,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.365
less constrained in their thinking.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.646
And younger.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.051
- Usually younger.
-Yeah.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.202
I told you we should've gone in.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.682
Oh, hush. May looks barely a day over...

11:37.240 --> 11:39.607
Thirty. You're gorgeous.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.207
Score one for the Howling Commandos.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.204
Your grandpa's pin should help
me locate Cybertek's mainframe.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.328
I didn't know they had
Wi-Fi back in the day.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.084
They didn't.
That's the beauty of the pin.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.282
It uses UHF to search for data.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.326
Nobody's even scanning those
frequencies for potential leaks.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.171
That's weird.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.568
I'm not finding any
digital data about anything.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.404
Let alone a source for it.
How's that possible?

12:06.480 --> 12:10.371
Maybe it's protected.
Or insulated somewhere inside.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.962
Guys, just keep them busy
a minute longer.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.327
Okay, now, show them the ICER bullet.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.085
I designed this to be powerful...

12:18.160 --> 12:20.925
I designed this to be
powerful, non-lethal,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.209
and to break up
under subcutaneous tissue.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.442
And my challenge was
that it could only hold a dose of...

12:26.520 --> 12:28.887
85 micrograms of dendrotoxin.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.850
He should've run the specs by me
before building the molds.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.649
But I think we can all agree that...

12:33.720 --> 12:36.690
The true beauty is
in my hyper-concentrated...

12:36.760 --> 12:37.807
- Dendrotoxin...
-My cartridge casing...

12:37.880 --> 12:40.121
...dendrotoxin formula...
-Projection system. Obviously.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.328
...with compressed air expulsion.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.368
We've seen one of these bullets before.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.405
What did they use it with?

12:46.480 --> 12:49.529
- The sleepy-sleep gun, I think.
-That's right.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.762
Our team took this rudimentary concept

12:51.880 --> 12:54.360
and converted it into
an aerosol grenade.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.124
Much more useful.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.690
But this is an ICER.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.286
Yes, but this is an ICER.

13:00.360 --> 13:04.001
Triple the stopping power
and a much cooler name.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.530
What else do you have?

13:07.880 --> 13:08.961
Here we go.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.169
Building permits
Cybertek's filed in the city.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.768
There's something funky
about the fourth floor.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.888
Only one way in or out.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.409
Extra reinforced security door.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.124
That's gotta be it, right?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.123
Coulson, May,
can you get to the fourth floor?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.089
It's a shame it didn't work out.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.361
It is.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.522
So lovely meeting you both.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.284
Does your sweater itch?

13:53.360 --> 13:55.044
- A little bit.
-Yeah.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.370
I don't know if I've said it enough,

14:16.440 --> 14:18.124
but I'm glad you're back.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.884
Try not to set the drapes on fire.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.280
Skye, I think I know why
you couldn't find the mainframe.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.001
There isn't one.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.764
What do you mean, there isn't one?

14:46.400 --> 14:48.243
All the files are hard copies.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.482
That's why Granny
was typing during our meeting.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.964
We're here. Might as well look around.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.205
You're staring at me again.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.601
You gave them my son.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.570
All I see are pictures of him in a cell.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.326
I was following orders. Just like you.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.723
So is someone
playing God with you, too?

15:13.800 --> 15:16.041
Seeing everything you see?

15:16.320 --> 15:17.765
Waiting to push a button

15:17.840 --> 15:20.844
and blow a hole in your skull
if you disobey?

15:21.640 --> 15:23.290
Is there?

15:23.520 --> 15:24.521
No.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.250
Then why are you here?

15:27.160 --> 15:31.370
For you and others like you.
People with gifts.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.844
I'm waiting for what's inside
to be revealed.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.803
The girl, Skye.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.168
What do you know about her?
Where does she come from?

15:44.240 --> 15:45.924
Why do you care?

15:46.040 --> 15:47.883
Because inside,

15:47.960 --> 15:51.009
I believe she and I
have something in common.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.564
Hey, Coulson.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.564
Mike Peterson's file.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.321
How can this all
be Project Deathlok?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.970
1990?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.724
How far back does this thing go?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.562
Garrett was the first Deathlok.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.930
Let's go.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.651
Skye, Trip, get ready
for a large file transfer.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.370
How large?

16:53.720 --> 16:55.449
- Back it up.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.970
You were gonna let me die!

17:37.040 --> 17:41.250
Okay, first off, I think
we should use our indoor voices.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.891
Since the day we met,
I have done everything you asked.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.490
I'm not sure we can say everything.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.245
You were gonna let Deathlok kill me
to get that hard drive?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.846
Come on, we both know the girl
wasn't gonna let you die.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.161
You said yourself, Skye's a soft touch.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.004
Just like you.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.809
I am not that scared kid anymore.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.123
Then stop acting like it.
Stop being weak.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.244
All these years,
and you're still playing the victim.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.210
Sometimes I ask myself
why I ever bothered.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.371
John? John!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.843
Everybody out, now!

18:15.800 --> 18:17.484
All right, here we go.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.410
That's it.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.164
I said, get the hell out!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.684
You heard the man.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.484
All right, hang in there.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.009
I'll get you stabilized.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.166
Garrett started
Project Deathlok way back in 1990.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.607
Look at this. He was Patient Zero.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.003
We've been
looking at all this backwards.

18:47.200 --> 18:51.000
Garrett doesn't just want GH-325
for his Centipede soldiers,

18:51.080 --> 18:52.764
he wants it for himself.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.042
So he can become a real live boy again.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.170
And if he happens to create an army

18:58.280 --> 19:01.363
of programed super-soldiers
for HYDRA along the way,

19:01.440 --> 19:02.566
triple bonus points.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.324
How do we know Garrett
didn't do that to Ward, too?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.890
Maybe he's been programed.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.645
Fitz, when are you gonna
stop clinging to the idea

19:08.720 --> 19:10.927
that Ward's the victim
and not the perpetrator?

19:11.120 --> 19:14.249
When I see something that tells me
I shouldn't with my own two eyes.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.731
We don't know all the facts.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.650
You want a fact, Fitz?
Ward murders people.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.130
I should've let Mike finish him
when I had the chance.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.091
I'm stupid and weak.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.208
You weren't weak.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.442
You had compassion. That's harder.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.766
We'll find him.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.286
Pizza delivery for Pablo Jimenez!

19:40.760 --> 19:42.444
That's me!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.124
Bio-mechanics rebooting.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.204
There.
That should do it.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.966
You scared me.
Hasn't happened like that in a while.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.963
Yes, it has.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.930
Been happening more and more.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.209
The bio-mechanics are fine.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.282
It's my organs that are failing.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.604
What are you saying, John?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.128
I'm dying.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.249
Cybertek team gives me a month.
Two, tops.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.004
You never came out to eat.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.730
Not much of an appetite.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.410
Look.

20:42.480 --> 20:46.166
Fitz can't process the truth about Ward.
Not yet.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.687
What he said,
it's what he needs to believe.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.489
Do you think Ward's being controlled?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.210
Absolutely not.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.684
Neither do I.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.840
You know,
I never gave you enough credit

21:04.920 --> 21:07.844
for this whole Zen warrior thing.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.686
But I got to admit, it'd be nice
to feel nothing right now.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.444
You think I don't feel anything?

21:13.840 --> 21:19.131
Look at you. You're a statue.
And you and Ward had a thing.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.043
So if anyone should be furious...

21:21.240 --> 21:22.924
lam.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.370
I'm furious.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.806
But I'm sure as hell
not gonna waste it on a tantrum.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.486
I'm gonna mine it. Save it.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.487
And when we find Ward,

21:37.560 --> 21:41.610
I'm gonna use every bit of it
to take him down.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.051
Wish I knew how to use that hate-f...

21:47.920 --> 21:49.604
I'm up most mornings at 5:00.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.449
Trip ID'd a number
of Cybertek shipments

21:55.520 --> 21:57.010
that ping-ponged across the globe.

21:57.080 --> 22:01.404
Brazil, Cambodia, Syria,
but they all ended up in Havana.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.130
S.H.I.E.L.D. used to have a base there.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.204
I told you we'd find him.
We're going to Cuba.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.651
Five bucks? That's it, huh?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.125
Si.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.248
Same thing cost me $30 in Rome.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.842
- There it is. The face of our future.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.605
Mr. Quinn's the poster boy
for our new enterprise.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.285
Not sure how that's supposed to work.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.001
He's also an international fugitive
accused of a laundry list of crimes.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.965
Accused by S.H.I.E.L.D.,

22:38.040 --> 22:40.281
of whom I've been
a vocal critic for years.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.522
Now S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
gone down in flames,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.165
while I arise from the ashes,

22:44.240 --> 22:47.722
all charges dismissed and
my sterling reputation restored.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.729
I knew there was a reason I didn't
rip out that silver tongue of yours.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.490
Everything on schedule?

22:54.600 --> 22:58.366
Your flamboyant display in Bogota
got a lot of people's attention.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.648
I'll be in DC tomorrow capitalizing on it.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.724
- Good.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.484
It's Raina.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.484
Maybe she has news.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.080
Okay, Ernesto.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.771
Let's show them
what handsome really looks like.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.562
- Everything okay?
-Everything's fine.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.849
- Is there a problem with the drug?
-This isn't about the drug.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.209
I thought Agent Garrett
shared my interest

23:27.280 --> 23:29.806
in special people, in transformation.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.402
But now I realize
he was just afraid to die.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.365
So I'm not sure how interested he'll be
in what I found out about Skye.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.604
Skye?

23:42.040 --> 23:44.441
I probably shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.090
I should go straight to Garrett.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.448
Garrett's got more important
things to worry about.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.970
You can tell me instead.

23:56.120 --> 24:00.728
I've been looking through the files
that Skye downloaded from the plane.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.691
And in addition to medical records,

24:03.760 --> 24:07.481
I found hospital files,
adoption agency searches.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.610
Skye's an orphan.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.125
Been looking for her parents for a while.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.725
It's not exactly a secret.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.010
But that's what intrigued me.
That and her DNA.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.721
It appears to be a match

24:20.800 --> 24:22.962
for someone I heard about
a long time ago.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.210
You know something
about Skye's history?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.126
I can't confirm it's her,

24:28.200 --> 24:30.009
but I did hear a story about a baby girl.

24:31.880 --> 24:32.927
Years ago,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.881
a village in the Hunan Province
in China was destroyed.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.644
Every man, woman and child

24:39.720 --> 24:42.883
torn apart by monsters
trying to find that baby.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.960
Did the monsters
kill the baby's parents?

24:47.160 --> 24:50.846
No. That's what's so interesting.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.481
The baby's parents were the monsters.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.930
Give me one reason
not to blow your head off.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.484
I brought tacos.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.407
I was half-expecting you
to be long gone.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.528
I was half-expecting you
to never come back.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.571
You said a couple of months.
It's been six.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.166
Been out of the country on assignment.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.726
Seems like you and Buddy
did okay without me.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.729
First few weeks were rough.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.126
But then I realized
my thinking was limited.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.884
So I started raiding cabins.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.161
Got some tools, the tent. Life got easier.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.369
Gonna build a cabin over there.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.201
See? I told you you could do it.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.843
Damn, son,
you stepped up in a big way.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.729
I couldn't be prouder
if you were my own.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.684
I lied about the tacos.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.004
What's that for?

26:23.160 --> 26:24.844
Your next lesson.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.770
Your turn.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.126
Stick with me, kid.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.050
In a couple years,
you'll shoot better than that.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.400
Something about that woman
unnerves me.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.204
It's those eyes.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.011
It's what's behind those eyes.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.088
What'd she text you about earlier?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.486
She had questions about your decision

27:04.600 --> 27:06.329
to pack up the lab
and move it to the States.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.167
We planned to expand
operations anyway.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.851
The fact that the Deathlok files
were stolen from Cybertek

27:13.920 --> 27:15.729
just speeds up my decision.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.170
I heard you wanted to hang on
to this during the flight.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.050
You heard right.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.923
You've recreated GH-325?

27:24.120 --> 27:25.610
Almost.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.284
We've distilled the genetic components

27:27.360 --> 27:30.170
of all the previous samples
down to one single vial.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.084
And it'll do what we talked about?

27:32.720 --> 27:35.087
It should regenerate and heal cells,

27:35.160 --> 27:37.845
just like it did in Skye and Coulson.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.524
So take good care of it.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.921
That's the only one in the world.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.961
You sure you don't want
anything else?

27:47.040 --> 27:50.886
How about one of these
quarter walkie-talkies?

27:50.960 --> 27:52.610
They have a built-in homing beacon.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.444
- Okay.
-I'll keep one, too.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.161
- Thanks.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.288
Don't wanna be greedy.
We've already got the D.W.A.R.F.s.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.204
No problem. All right.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.886
Because we had
to fly in low,

28:07.960 --> 28:10.531
we'll have to search for our plane
from the ground.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.365
Fitz, Simmons, you have the maps.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.363
Do not engage
under any circumstances.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.522
If you find the bus,
call us and stand down,

28:17.600 --> 28:18.840
or come back here and wait.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.570
- We'll be careful.
-Understood, sir.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.490
Let's do it.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.130
We're too late. They're gone.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.565
They knew we were coming.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.210
I'm not sure everyone's gone.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.567
Something's generating
a lot of volts in there.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.563
--Yeah?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.291
Sir, we found the bus.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.842
It's on an airfield outside Abel
Santamaria packing up to leave.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.401
We're on our way.
How far is that from our location?

28:48.600 --> 28:49.647
About three hours.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.881
But by the looks of it,

28:50.960 --> 28:52.883
they'll be long gone
by the time you can get here, sir.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.565
Get out of there, right now.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.723
Do not engage.
Wait for us back at the Jumpjet.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.490
Copy that, sir.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.967
Garrett's leaving.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.690
We have to at least try
and get over there.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.881
Or not.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.564
We still have this little puppy.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.728
If there's a computer system
in that barber shop,

29:07.800 --> 29:08.881
we don't have to chase them anymore.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.042
We just plug it in,
we wake up the Trojan horse,

29:11.120 --> 29:12.360
and we're off to the races.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.124
Worth a shot.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.924
Let's do it.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.764
I know we're not
supposed to engage,

29:17.840 --> 29:20.081
but if they get away,
we'll be back to square one.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.404
I can't handle square one again.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.124
Garrett's there, which means
Ward's probably there, too.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.131
What if we send
a D.W.A.R.F. into the plane from here?

29:33.200 --> 29:35.521
It can stow away inside,
so we can track where the bus is going.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.444
Yes, Simmons, excellent suggestion.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.965
We can send Sleepy,
he's our best listener.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.087
Next to you, of course.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.606
Okay, I'll go get him from the car.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.644
Long time no see.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.004
Here you go.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.083
You know
he's not human, right?

30:02.160 --> 30:04.128
Of course, I know.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.567
He's better than human.

30:06.640 --> 30:10.008
Smart, loyal, trustworthy.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.881
Yeah, where does all that
trust and loyalty lead?

30:14.400 --> 30:17.768
Abandoned in the woods,
or dumped at the pound?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.164
I learned that lesson the hard way.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.208
I know you've never asked,
but I'm sure you're curious.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.964
Nickel version,

30:30.840 --> 30:35.164
I got fragged by an IED
outside Sarajevo.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.971
When I radioed for medevac,

30:38.040 --> 30:40.611
I got nothing but an earful of excuses.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.806
That's when I realized

30:42.880 --> 30:47.090
I was more loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D.
than S.H.I.E.L.D. was to me.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.324
So I decided, if I made it out,
if I survived,

30:51.400 --> 30:54.370
I was gonna treat them
the way they treated me.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.082
Then I stuffed my intestines
back inside,

30:59.160 --> 31:02.528
duct taped myself shut
and humped my way out.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.284
You remember when we first met?

31:06.520 --> 31:08.329
Told you I worked for
a secret organization?

31:09.440 --> 31:11.841
It's more like I work for
a secret organization

31:11.920 --> 31:13.809
inside another secret organization.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.564
You ever heard of HYDRA?

31:15.960 --> 31:17.644
- Mmm-mmm.
-Huh.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.850
HYDRA understands
the importance of survival.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.884
Here they are.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.241
This is our plane. We want it back.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.846
Really? Just like that, kid?

31:38.040 --> 31:39.963
Coulson probably figured out
we were using the barbershop.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.690
Call Kaminsky. He'll know what to do.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.161
All right, let's close up the ramp
and get this bird off the ground.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.770
Tell the pilot to keep it low
and in Harrier mode

31:45.880 --> 31:47.530
-till we're out over the Gulf.
-Will do.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.204
What's he got there?

31:52.840 --> 31:54.490
One of those prank joy buzzers.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.323
Yeah, you know me.
Always kidding around.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.290
What the hell was that?

32:03.240 --> 32:04.446
An EMP.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.170
Looks like the joke's on you.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.246
Garrett's dying. Not sure this will work.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.561
Fitz shorted him out with an EMP.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.687
Call Cybertek.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.444
Let them know what happened.
See what they can do.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.204
Get back.

32:28.200 --> 32:33.047
I'm glad that I did it.
You hear me? You lose, we win.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.451
You're dead.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.646
No worse than you.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.200
And you don't have to take
orders from him anymore, Ward.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.249
Ward! Let him die.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.928
He deserves to die.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.684
Get them out of here.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.564
Clear! Everybody out!

32:54.720 --> 32:56.802
I have some good news.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.564
Can it wait a minute?

33:02.800 --> 33:05.963
Damn dog takes off running
every time I take a shot out here.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.562
That deer's 1,800 meters out.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.243
Gonna take him a while to find it.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.126
I'm all ears.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.841
You've been accepted
by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Operations Division.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.604
Effective immediately.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.162
We need to pack up.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.527
Thank you, sir. For everything.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.250
Don't do that.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.526
You don't owe me
or anybody else a thing.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.768
You earned it by yourself.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.289
It's gonna be hard when you get there.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.124
If you're gonna work within
S.H.I.E.L.D. for HYDRA,

33:39.200 --> 33:42.363
you can't ever get attached to
anyone or anything.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.444
You have to fight that weakness in you.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.806
- Yes, sir.
-Good.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.888
Now take care of Buddy
and we'll get out of here.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.444
That's not a weakness, is it?

33:58.440 --> 34:01.125
- No, sir.
-Good. I'll be at the truck.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.645
The internal battery must have fried.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.848
We're gonna have to open it up.
See if there's a mechanical fix.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.724
I talked to Cybertek.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.570
They're prepping a facility in Miami.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.324
Good.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.487
I need you to do something for me.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.165
Yeah, anything.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.889
Put down Fitz and Simmons.

34:21.159 --> 34:25.005
What? No. There's plenty of time.
I won't leave you.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.764
And I'm telling you
to cross them off for me.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.004
It's not a weakness, is it?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.366
No.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.123
Then take care of them.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.922
I'll take care of me.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.801
I've cheated death plenty of times.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.083
I'll stay.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.569
- Skye, where are the computers?
- I'm working on it.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.769
Trip, got anything in your granddad's kit
might help us out here?

35:07.840 --> 35:10.525
Always. Let me take a look.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.649
There's a mechanical fail-safe
in case the electronics shut down.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.011
I'm pretty interesting inside.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.970
That's my Centipede serum.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.281
It's the only thing that's been
keeping me alive

35:39.360 --> 35:41.044
these past few months.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.890
Why isn't it making you strong?

35:44.400 --> 35:46.209
I'm too far gone.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.244
I'm afraid your entire system
is shutting down.

35:53.320 --> 35:57.723
Maybe we can jump-start it with this.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.125
Coulson will find us,
won't he?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.168
Man won't rest until every HYDRA agent

36:04.240 --> 36:06.402
is either dead or behind bars.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.564
Go!

36:15.760 --> 36:17.444
Go!

36:19.120 --> 36:20.167
Oh! Oh!

36:20.280 --> 36:22.328
- Fitz!
-Get in there! Go!

36:27.000 --> 36:28.684
Open the door, Fitz.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.609
Ward, please.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.684
- I need to understand.
-You need to accept the truth, Fitz.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.525
He doesn't care about us.
About anything.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.602
No, I don't believe that.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.047
We're friends, aren't we?

36:43.120 --> 36:46.203
We've been friends.
We've had laughs together.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.642
I know that
you're a good person, Ward.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.882
And you can choose right now
to be good. It's a choice.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.809
I've got my orders. Open up the door.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.124
No.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.004
Not a chance.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.331
Okay, have it your way.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.924
Wait. What are you doing?

37:33.280 --> 37:35.760
- Fitz.
-Okay. Wait.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.921
- What are you doing?
-Wait.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.002
- No. Ward, just think about this.
-Okay, wait.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.880
- Wait. Ward. Okay, wait.
-Just give it a second.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.849
- Ward, look at me.
-Think about this!

37:45.080 --> 37:46.570
Ward, just turn around!

37:46.640 --> 37:49.564
Don't do it! Don't do it, Ward!
Okay, you don't have to do this.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.369
- Ward!
-You don't have to. You have a choice.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.044
Ward, look at me!

37:53.120 --> 37:55.646
I know that you care about us, Ward!

37:57.040 --> 37:59.202
You're right. I do.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.044
It's a weakness.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.210
Ward!

38:31.680 --> 38:33.364
I can't promise it'll work,

38:33.560 --> 38:36.166
and once it's gone,
I won't be able to make any more.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.644
This is the end of the road.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.643
Without it, I'm dead for sure.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.564
So, what the hell?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.924
That's it.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.089
The final ingredient.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.964
Is it done?

39:26.120 --> 39:27.804
If the job was easy...

39:54.480 --> 39:56.164
What are you feeling?

40:00.320 --> 40:02.004
The universe.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.924
Come on.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.884
Over here.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.409
There's something behind this wall.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.240
Okay, I got something.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.004
A secret door?

40:17.760 --> 40:19.808
I got this. They're, like, my thing.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.404
Here we go.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.930
Finally.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.204
It's a Centipede soldier.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.366
Bogotá was a freebie, a calling card.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.644
A demonstration of what we can do.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.484
It was a circus.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.370
It was a single man

41:09.440 --> 41:12.842
with no support team
and no extraction plan.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.890
I mean, come on, tell me,

41:16.960 --> 41:19.486
how much did you spend
to get bin Laden?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.528
Between the ships,
and the choppers, support troops?

41:21.600 --> 41:23.807
What was it? Thirty million?
Fifty million?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.564
Whatever the price, it was worth it.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.409
Maybe.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.563
My super-soldier could have done
it for a fraction of the price.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.484
Is that why you're here?

41:32.560 --> 41:35.484
Are you proposing to sell us
this super-soldier of yours?

41:36.440 --> 41:38.204
God, no.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.965
I'm proposing to sell you 1000 of them.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.929
Better, stronger, faster.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.367
Gentlemen, with the continued exposure

41:50.440 --> 41:53.011
of corrupt institutions like S.H.I.E.L.D.,

41:53.080 --> 41:55.686
with the terrifying rise of HYDRA,

41:55.760 --> 42:00.527
the need for reliable security
is at an all-time high.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.246
Which is why we are expanding
our super-soldier operations

42:05.320 --> 42:06.685
into a brand new,

42:06.760 --> 42:10.082
state-of-the-art Cybertek facility.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.650
So, would you and your friends
like a tour?
