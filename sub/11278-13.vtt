        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:06.100 --> 00:08.300
          What's going on there?

00:08.400 --> 00:10.700
There appears to be a man       
lying in the street.            

00:10.800 --> 00:12.100
    Oh, my God, it's Woody!     
Woody.                          

00:12.200 --> 00:13.100
  Excuse us,                    
  excuse us.                    

00:13.200 --> 00:14.500
  Move back, please,            
  a doctor coming.              

00:14.600 --> 00:15.500
Are you                         
all right?                      

00:15.600 --> 00:16.700
 Don't move me, don't move me!

REBECCA:                        
Don't move him!                 

00:17.900 --> 00:19.400
Somebody get help!

00:24.500 --> 00:25.500
                Thanks, Woods.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.800
Hey, Carla, you'll never believe
          what I found          

01:39.900 --> 01:41.500
     in the storage closet.     

01:41.600 --> 01:43.100
This great old foosball table.  

01:43.200 --> 01:44.800
        (screams)               

01:44.800 --> 01:47.400
          Yeah, I was           
      pretty excited, too.      

01:47.500 --> 01:49.700
  This foosball table is evil.  

01:49.800 --> 01:51.200
          It's cursed.          

01:51.200 --> 01:52.500
What are you talking about?     

01:52.500 --> 01:56.900
    One day, it mysteriously    
appeared in the alley out back. 

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
From the moment we started      
          to play it,           

01:59.100 --> 02:01.700
    this place turned           
    from a nice local tavern    

02:01.800 --> 02:05.800
      into a seething pit       
of resentment and backstabbing. 

02:05.900 --> 02:08.699
    Oh... so that's             
    how it happened.            

02:12.800 --> 02:15.300
I'm telling you, things got ugly
          around here.          

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
One time,                       

02:16.500 --> 02:19.000
        the ball flew out and   
        hit Clavin in the eye   

02:19.100 --> 02:20.700
                  for no earthly
                         reason.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.000
                     (laughing):
                It was funny.   

02:24.100 --> 02:25.600
              But it was spooky.

02:25.700 --> 02:26.900
That's when                     
I realized                      

02:27.000 --> 02:28.700
                    that this   

02:28.700 --> 02:30.700
is an evil foosball table.      

02:30.800 --> 02:33.000
            Well, why didn't you
                  get rid of it?

02:33.100 --> 02:35.300
Well, we tried to throw it away,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.300
                but the trashman
                who picked it up

02:37.300 --> 02:40.600
                slipped and fell
          backward into traffic.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.200
    I'll never forget           
    his last words...           

02:44.300 --> 02:46.200
         "What the...?"         

02:53.300 --> 02:57.700
Well, it's, it's not exactly    
"The Telltale Heart," but...    

02:57.700 --> 03:00.200
it's a pretty good story.       

03:00.200 --> 03:01.400
                Gee, Carla, I   
                    had no idea.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.900
                     I'll put it
                     right back.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.700
                Hey, Cliffie!   
                Huh?            

03:03.900 --> 03:05.800
                  Check it out--
                 the foos table.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
                  Too late.     

03:06.900 --> 03:08.800
            It has risen from   
            its resting place   

03:08.800 --> 03:11.700
                to feed upon the
            fat and middle-aged.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.300
            Uh, Sam.            

03:15.400 --> 03:18.500
         Oh, hey, John,         
how very nice to see you again. 

03:18.600 --> 03:19.200
You're lying, aren't you?       

03:19.400 --> 03:20.700
        Yes, I am.              

03:22.100 --> 03:24.500
Mr. Hill, I just had lunch      
     up at your restaurant      

03:24.500 --> 03:26.400
        and the risotto with bay
        scallops and fennel--   

03:26.500 --> 03:28.300
          oh, I think it was the
                  most delicious

03:28.400 --> 03:30.000
thing I've ever had             
to eat.                         

03:30.100 --> 03:30.900
We'll name it for you.          

03:30.900 --> 03:32.200
                    Thank you.  

03:32.200 --> 03:33.000
        Hey, come here.         

03:33.100 --> 03:34.300
                          I hate
                    this guy.   

03:34.400 --> 03:36.100
          What are you, what are
      you kissing up to him for?

03:36.200 --> 03:39.000
I'm not kissing up, Sam,        
I like the food.                

03:39.100 --> 03:41.300
Sam, you don't have             
to be jealous.                  

03:41.400 --> 03:43.700
You are a very                  
handsome businessman,           

03:43.700 --> 03:46.000
and you own the                 
hottest spot in town.           

03:46.000 --> 03:47.800
                Oh, oh, thank   
                  you very much.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.100
 <i>That's</i> kissing up.             

03:53.900 --> 03:56.000
Sam, I think we both know       
         why I'm here.          

03:56.100 --> 03:58.800
    I bet you want the number   
to my hairstylist. Don't you?   

03:59.000 --> 04:00.700
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

04:00.800 --> 04:02.200
      Now, that was cruel.      

04:06.100 --> 04:08.000
Sam, as we both know,           

04:08.100 --> 04:10.800
I own legal title to your       
poolroom and both bathrooms.    
                            Hey,

04:10.800 --> 04:12.800
 why do you keep repeating that 
 every time you come down here? 

04:12.900 --> 04:14.500
 You're driving me up the wall. 

04:14.600 --> 04:15.700
        That's why.             

04:15.700 --> 04:17.300
Now where was I?                

04:17.399 --> 04:19.500
Oh, yes, as you know, I own     
legal title to your poolroom    

04:19.600 --> 04:22.000
and both bathrooms,             

04:22.100 --> 04:24.900
and rent on said property is    
past due since last Wednesday.  

04:25.000 --> 04:26.300
I hope you haven't              
forgotten me, Sam.              

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
                  Forgotten you?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.200
John, I could never forget you. 

04:29.300 --> 04:31.400
    You're in my bad dreams     
          every night.          

04:31.400 --> 04:32.900
    You're the reason           
    why I'm in therapy          

04:33.000 --> 04:34.200
 for the first time in my life. 

04:34.300 --> 04:35.700
Well,                           
don't forget                    

04:35.800 --> 04:37.800
to mention to your therapist    
that I own legal title to y...  

04:37.800 --> 04:38.900
                      All right,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.200
     all right, all right,      
        all right.              

04:41.300 --> 04:44.000
         I'll write you         
    your stupid check.          

04:44.000 --> 04:45.600
         Sam, I'm a little hurt.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.500
            If you felt the need
             to see a therapist,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.500
                  why didn't you
                     come to me?

04:48.600 --> 04:49.700
     Oh...                      

04:49.800 --> 04:51.400
      Well, I-- you know,       
    I was looking, sort of,     

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
    for a doctor that,          
    you know, didn't know me    

04:53.600 --> 04:54.700
so well,                        

04:54.700 --> 04:58.600
    who has, uh, blonde hair    
         and smoky eyes         

04:58.600 --> 05:03.000
and wears miniskirts and crosses
     her legs all the time.     

05:03.000 --> 05:04.200
              Oh.               

05:04.300 --> 05:05.300
Connie Forsythe, a fine doctor. 

05:05.300 --> 05:06.400
Yeah.                           

05:06.400 --> 05:07.200
        (chuckles)              

05:07.400 --> 05:08.200
She'll straighten you out.      

05:08.300 --> 05:09.000
          Oh, she did.          

05:10.800 --> 05:12.100
Here's my personal check.       

05:12.200 --> 05:14.000
              You'll notice that
                I made it out to

05:14.000 --> 05:16.600
      John "You Stink" Hill.    

05:16.600 --> 05:19.600
Sam, this is not up             
to your usual standards.        

05:19.700 --> 05:20.100
         (blows raspberry)      

05:20.300 --> 05:21.500
        Now it is.              

05:22.900 --> 05:25.700
 Man, I can never get the guy.  

05:25.700 --> 05:27.600
     I hate him. Just once      
  I would like to do something  

05:27.700 --> 05:29.100
that gets under his skin.       

05:29.200 --> 05:30.500
  Sam, forget him, he's gone.   
No, he's                        

05:30.600 --> 05:32.100
        not gone,               
  there's no escaping the guy.  

05:32.200 --> 05:34.000
            I mean,             
  I-I walk down my own hallway  

05:34.100 --> 05:35.600
and I know that I'm on his turf.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.300
  I can't even go to the damn   
 bathroom without getting mad.  

05:38.300 --> 05:40.600
    Oh, you, too, Sammy?        

05:42.700 --> 05:44.400
You know something?             

05:44.500 --> 05:45.400
I'm out of here.                

05:45.500 --> 05:46.700
I'm gonna go see                
Dr. Forsythe.                   

05:46.700 --> 05:48.500
I got to get this               
out of my system.               

05:48.600 --> 05:49.900
            You're going to talk
                to her about it?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.200
      No, I'm gonna get it      
    out of my system. Talk?     

05:55.600 --> 05:56.800
                Excuse me.      

05:56.800 --> 05:58.600
                     Are you Mr.
                         Malone?
             Yeah.              

05:58.700 --> 06:00.800
    Well, there seems to be a   
        problem with this check.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.700
Oh, what? I just                
made a joke name up.            

06:02.700 --> 06:03.900
    Big deal.                   

06:04.000 --> 06:05.900
All he has to do                
is make sure he endorses it     

06:06.000 --> 06:07.100
John "I Stink" Hill.            

06:07.100 --> 06:08.200
         (laughs)               

06:08.300 --> 06:10.700
        No, Mr. Malone,         
 you made it out for too much.  

06:10.800 --> 06:13.000
                    You added an
                     extra zero.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.600
        Wow.                    

06:14.700 --> 06:17.000
Oh, well, thank you             
very much, it's...              

06:17.000 --> 06:19.200
        I'm kind of surprised   
          someone as nice as you

06:19.300 --> 06:21.600
                  works for that
            bald-headed jackass.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.600
Oh, I don't work for him.       

06:22.700 --> 06:24.900
I'm the bald-headed             
jackass' daughter,              

06:24.900 --> 06:27.600
Valerie "You Stink" Hill.       

06:28.400 --> 06:30.800
                  I'm sorry.    

06:30.900 --> 06:33.300
            I-I-I never intended
          for anyone to see that

06:33.400 --> 06:34.800
                 except John.   

06:34.800 --> 06:36.400
And all the people at the bank. 

06:36.500 --> 06:38.100
                 Well, yeah.    

06:39.500 --> 06:41.700
                  I'll write you
                  another check.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.200
Valerie, what are you doing     
down here?                      

06:45.300 --> 06:48.000
          I asked you           
    never to come down here.    

06:49.900 --> 06:52.600
I just wanted to get            
the right amount on the check.  

06:52.700 --> 06:55.700
Well, I was perfectly pleased   
     with the amount as written.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.500
                Besides, I don't
            want you associating

06:57.500 --> 06:58.900
with the element                
that hangs around               

06:59.000 --> 07:01.800
                    in this bar.
                Wipe your hands.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.800
        Thank you.              

07:06.200 --> 07:07.500
                Sam, I heard you
                  say you wanted

07:07.600 --> 07:09.100
                    to get under
                Mr. Hill's skin.

07:09.200 --> 07:09.800
        Yeah.                   

07:09.900 --> 07:11.200
              Well, I got a way,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.700
                  but... I think
                it's impossible.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.600
You're thinking that maybe      
I should date his daughter?     

07:15.600 --> 07:16.800
     (laughs)                   

07:16.800 --> 07:18.400
          Great idea!           

07:18.400 --> 07:21.700
 No, no, no, if you really want 
 to get under Mr. Hill's skin,  

07:21.800 --> 07:25.900
the best way is we shrink you   
down to microscopic size        

07:26.000 --> 07:27.500
and then we put you             
in a syringe                    

07:27.600 --> 07:29.800
and we inject you               
right into his arm.             

07:29.900 --> 07:31.600
But I still say                 
it's impossible.                

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
                Oh, I love this.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.700
        This is a great idea.   

07:34.700 --> 07:35.900
                      Oh, great.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.600
      Now I got Sam trying      
         to contradict          

07:37.700 --> 07:39.200
 the immutable laws of science. 

07:40.800 --> 07:43.200
    When am I going to learn    
     to keep my mouth shut?     

07:51.000 --> 07:52.900
     (elegant music plays)      

07:53.000 --> 07:56.300
        You know, Sam, I have to
              confess I've never
                 really been out

07:56.400 --> 07:57.600
                 with a guy like
                     you before.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.300
              I'm afraid I don't
        even know how to act.   

07:59.300 --> 08:00.800
Ah, well,                       
it's really easy.               

08:00.900 --> 08:02.400
Shimmy over here                
a little bit, will you?         

08:02.500 --> 08:03.400
There you go.                   

08:03.500 --> 08:05.800
Now... first off,               
just, you know,                 

08:05.900 --> 08:08.400
adjust your, uh,                
outfit a little bit there.      

08:08.400 --> 08:09.500
Very good.                      

08:09.500 --> 08:11.100
Laugh like hell                 
at everything I say             

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
and, oh, yeah,                  
put your hand in my lap.        

08:13.200 --> 08:14.800
                  (laughs)      

08:14.900 --> 08:17.000
          (chuckling):          
  No, th-that was not a joke.   

08:17.000 --> 08:21.500
    Sam, I really feel like I   
  don't know what to say to you.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.500
Well, it doesn't                
really matter, sweetheart,      

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
    it's just...                

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
All you got to do               
is make sure you whisper it     

08:26.500 --> 08:28.000
right here,                     
right in my neck.               

08:28.100 --> 08:29.700
Yeah, there you go.             
Oh, hi, John!                   

08:29.700 --> 08:31.400
(laughs)                        

08:31.400 --> 08:33.500
Boy, I didn't expect            
to see you here tonight.        

08:33.600 --> 08:35.799
 Sam, I see you've made friends 
    with my daughter.           

08:35.900 --> 08:38.200
Oh, yes, we're very good        
friends by now, John.           

08:38.200 --> 08:41.900
I've discovered how her eyes    
dance in the light,             

08:42.000 --> 08:46.300
how neat her hair smells,       
how soft her skin feels.        

08:46.300 --> 08:48.900
Modesty prevents me             
from going on.                  

08:49.000 --> 08:50.500
        Fine, I'll send         

08:50.600 --> 08:51.700
          the wine steward over.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.400
        Sam, I liked what you   
             said about my eyes,

08:57.500 --> 08:59.800
                but you know I'm
            wearing contacts.   

08:59.900 --> 09:01.100
        Hmm?                    

09:01.200 --> 09:02.500
Oh, yeah, yeah,                 
I know.                         

09:02.500 --> 09:05.400
I saw them swimming around      
in there earlier.               

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
Here, here, o-open up.          

09:10.300 --> 09:11.300
Hey, John, look at this.        

09:11.400 --> 09:13.800
Your daughter and I             
are sharing food together.      

09:16.000 --> 09:17.800
I hope                          
I'm not interrupting,           

09:17.800 --> 09:19.800
but has anybody told you about  
the specials for tonight?       

09:19.900 --> 09:22.300
 Oh, it doesn't really matter,  
  John. We're just gonna have   

09:22.400 --> 09:26.700
a ton of raw oysters            
and then dash out of            
here all out of breath.         

09:28.700 --> 09:31.500
The oysters are delicious.      

09:32.300 --> 09:35.000
What the hell kind              
of father is he?                

09:35.100 --> 09:37.300
Here I am, smelling your hair,  
talking oysters.                

09:37.400 --> 09:39.500
I mean, I could be the          
biggest creep in the world.     

09:39.600 --> 09:41.500
I could be taking you out       
for all the wrong reasons.      

09:41.600 --> 09:43.100
                Are you, Sam?   
No, of course not.              

09:43.900 --> 09:45.600
Here, jump in my lap.           

09:45.700 --> 09:47.700
             There you go.      

09:47.800 --> 09:49.400
Sam, I'm not sure               
I feel comfortable              

09:49.500 --> 09:50.800
sitting in your lap             
like this.                      

09:50.800 --> 09:52.500
            Hmm? Oh. How's that?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.100
     Oh, I like that.           

09:56.500 --> 09:59.900
Uh, Sam, I wonder if I could    
speak with you for a moment?    

10:00.000 --> 10:01.800
            Well, sure, John.   

10:01.900 --> 10:03.600
              Will you excuse me
          for a minute, Valerie?

10:03.700 --> 10:05.400
Oh, do I have to move?          

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
         Usually, but, uh, we'll
          talk about that later.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.800
Yes, John?                      

10:14.900 --> 10:16.600
                      Sam, I was
              thinking if you're

10:16.700 --> 10:18.100
      considering dessert,      
     I'd like to recommend      

10:18.200 --> 10:20.300
the Grand Marnier soufflé       
            for two.            

10:20.400 --> 10:21.600
                      It's quite
                        elegant.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.100
    The only thing is,          
      you have to order it      

10:23.200 --> 10:24.500
at least a half an hour ahead...

10:24.600 --> 10:27.100
Oh, please, don't take her away 
         from me, Sam.          

10:27.100 --> 10:29.000
    She's the only daughter     
         I've ever had.         

10:29.100 --> 10:31.000
            Please, Sam, please.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.100
Oh, John, I-I was just          
taking her out to annoy you.    

10:34.200 --> 10:38.300
I had no idea it would cause    
such genuine pain.              

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
          I'll give you anything
                  you want, Sam.

10:43.100 --> 10:43.900
                You want your   
                        poolroom

10:43.900 --> 10:46.000
              and both bathrooms
                rent-free, fine.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.700
          Just promise me you'll
        never see Valerie again.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.800
Oh, John, what kind of guy      
do you think I am?              

10:50.900 --> 10:52.300
I mean,                         
how can I go along              

10:52.300 --> 10:54.500
with a sleazy arrangement       
like that? Oh, boy, oh, boy.    

10:54.600 --> 10:56.900
        I'll give you my parking
        space for your Corvette.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.900
          Deal.                 

11:05.300 --> 11:06.600
  I'm telling you guys,         
  it was beautiful.             

11:06.700 --> 11:07.600
                        Yeah?   

11:07.700 --> 11:09.300
     I now have my poolroom     

11:09.400 --> 11:10.700
  and my bathrooms rent-free,   

11:10.700 --> 11:13.500
        but better yet,         
    I had the guy in tears.     

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
  Look at that--                
  I got some of them            

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
  right there                   
  on the napkin.                

11:17.100 --> 11:18.600
                      Very nice.
            Now, what are you   

11:18.700 --> 11:20.200
    gonna do about the date     
         with the girl?         

11:20.300 --> 11:21.400
      What?                     

11:21.400 --> 11:23.800
Oh, thank you, ooh.             

11:23.900 --> 11:26.000
          (laughing):           
        I forgot.               

11:26.000 --> 11:27.700
         Sam,                   

11:27.700 --> 11:28.900
I finished                      
all the oysters                 

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
and I'm feeling                 
kind of funny.                  

11:32.500 --> 11:33.600
  What do you want to do now?   

11:33.600 --> 11:35.700
         Actually, Val,         
     I'm kind of busy here.     

11:35.700 --> 11:37.400
 Uh, a problem's just come up.  

11:37.400 --> 11:39.500
         Uh, something          
      with the kegs here.       

11:39.600 --> 11:40.700
     The kegs are leaking.      

11:40.800 --> 11:41.800
                      What?!    

11:41.900 --> 11:43.900
He's feeding her                
a line, stupid.                 

11:43.900 --> 11:47.000
      Well, you don't joke about
    that kind of thing, ever.   

11:47.100 --> 11:48.000
VALERIE:                        
Well...                         

11:48.100 --> 11:49.800
maybe when                      
you're through here             

11:49.800 --> 11:51.000
we can go for a drive.          

11:51.100 --> 11:52.100
            Oh, I don't know.   

11:52.200 --> 11:54.500
              Uh, these kegs are
         a never-ending problem.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.300
         I'm thinking of getting
          rid of them, actually.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.800
          Hey, I don't find this
            kind of thing funny.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.500
            Okay, maybe it's me.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.500
Well, maybe we can              
do it another time.             

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
Uh... I don't, I don't think so.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.200
      I-I don't think things are
        working out, Valerie.   

12:07.300 --> 12:09.100
        All right.              

12:10.300 --> 12:11.900
    Was it something I did?     

12:11.900 --> 12:13.300
          Oh, no, no-no, no, no.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.600
    Uh, you know, some things   
    work out, some things don't.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.000
    This is one of those that   
        just didn't work out.   

12:21.100 --> 12:23.500
        Oh. Okay.               

12:24.900 --> 12:27.200
        Well, bye.              

12:27.300 --> 12:29.200
              Bye.              

12:32.500 --> 12:33.900
        (snaps fingers)         

12:36.900 --> 12:39.500
  I tell you, man, this is the  
  best deal I've ever scammed.  

12:39.600 --> 12:40.800
    I get my poolroom           

12:40.900 --> 12:42.700
  and my bathrooms rent-free,   
      and all I had to do       

12:42.700 --> 12:44.600
  was throw a little fish back  
     I didn't want anyway.      

12:44.700 --> 12:45.800
                CLIFF: Yeah, way
                to go, Sammy.   

12:45.900 --> 12:46.800
      You want to, uh, go       

12:46.900 --> 12:48.600
        shoot some stick        
    in <i>your</i> poolroom?           

12:48.700 --> 12:50.300
     No, I don't think so.      

12:50.400 --> 12:52.300
  Well, how'd you like to wash  
        your hands, Sam,        

12:52.400 --> 12:54.100
    in <i>your</i> bathroom?           

12:54.100 --> 12:55.400
            No, no.             

12:55.400 --> 12:56.700
     What <i>do</i> you want Sam?      

12:57.600 --> 12:59.000
 I want that little fish back.  

13:09.900 --> 13:11.600
                            Yes!
          Oh, we're tied!       

13:11.600 --> 13:14.100
        We're tied!             
                      (shouting)

13:14.900 --> 13:16.800
        Carla, give us the ball.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.300
    No, this is an evil game    
     and it brings a curse      

13:19.400 --> 13:20.700
    on anyone who plays it.     

13:20.700 --> 13:22.300
        I'm just trying         
    to save you guys.           

13:22.400 --> 13:23.500
             Oh, come on, Carla.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.900
            It's just a harmless
                  foosball game.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.300
          We're just having fun.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.800
                  So look, here,
            you drop the ball   

13:27.900 --> 13:30.100
     so I can tear the heads off
         these pasty-faced geeks

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
                 and drink their
                warm, red blood!

13:38.200 --> 13:40.700
                Did my head just
         turn completely around?

13:42.700 --> 13:45.000
                Or was that just
        a trick of the light?   

13:47.600 --> 13:50.800
        I can't believe I traded
              her for bathrooms.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.400
Sam, give me a break.           

13:53.400 --> 13:55.000
The only reason you're          
interested in that girl         

13:55.100 --> 13:56.600
is because you can't have her.  

13:56.600 --> 13:58.000
It was the same thing with me.  

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
You wanted her,                 
too, Miss Howe?                 

14:06.200 --> 14:09.700
  Boy, I've been in this city   
      one month too long.       

14:09.700 --> 14:10.900
      No, no...                 

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
                        Woody...

14:12.100 --> 14:13.600
he wanted me because            
he couldn't have me.            

14:13.700 --> 14:14.800
You know, Sam,                  

14:14.900 --> 14:16.700
if I told you right now         
you could have me,              

14:16.800 --> 14:18.200
I bet you wouldn't              
even be interested.             

14:18.300 --> 14:21.200
                 Maybe, but I'd,
            uh, still perform   

14:21.200 --> 14:22.800
      'cause I'm a professional.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.500
                  So, uh, Sammy.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.000
                 What is it now?
          What are you gonna do?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.900
I'm gonna see her again.        
                        FRASIER:
                            Sam,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.900
if you do that, you may         
end up having to pay rent       

14:32.000 --> 14:33.700
again on the poolroom           
and on the bathrooms.           

14:33.700 --> 14:35.000
          Why is that?          

14:35.100 --> 14:36.800
Well, if you take an action,    

14:36.900 --> 14:39.000
you'll have to face             
the consequences.               

14:39.100 --> 14:41.000
          No, I don't.          
        I'm Sammy.              

14:41.100 --> 14:43.100
      Where have you been       
        all these years?        

14:43.100 --> 14:44.800
Oh, right.                      

14:44.800 --> 14:46.400
I forgot, you're                
Nietzsche's Superman.           

14:46.500 --> 14:47.700
                          CLIFF:
                    Oh, yeah.   

14:47.800 --> 14:49.300
                 Is that the one
        with the craggy face,   

14:49.400 --> 14:51.200
         uh, looks like granite?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.900
        No. No-no,              
 that's, uh, Bizarro Superman.  

14:53.900 --> 14:57.300
      Oh, wait, which one       
was weakened by red Kryptonite? 

14:57.400 --> 14:58.900
                  Blue Superman.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.400
     I thought he was black     
and he wore the big hats.       

15:01.500 --> 15:02.900
     No, that's Super Fly.      

15:08.100 --> 15:09.600
  Woody, come over here, man.   

15:09.700 --> 15:12.100
  I want you to run a note up   
    to Valerie for me.          

15:12.200 --> 15:13.400
"I'm sorry for everything.      

15:13.400 --> 15:15.600
"Would you please go away       
with me this weekend?           

15:15.600 --> 15:17.200
I can't stop thinking           
of you. Sam."                   

15:17.200 --> 15:18.500
Take it upstairs.               

15:18.500 --> 15:20.600
Just make sure her father       
doesn't get this, all right?    

15:20.700 --> 15:22.500
                  No sweat, Sam.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.800
You know, back in Hanover,      

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
    I was the official town     
          go-between.           

15:25.900 --> 15:29.200
     Anytime anybody needed     
     a love note delivered,     

15:29.200 --> 15:30.800
they'd call on Woody Boyd.      

15:30.800 --> 15:33.700
It got to where all I had       
to do was knock on a door,      

15:33.800 --> 15:35.900
    my butt was filled          
         with birdshot.         

15:37.500 --> 15:39.700
                      All right,
                 I got the ball.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.500
All right.                      
                 Foos 'em if you
            got 'em, come on.   

15:41.500 --> 15:42.700
                    Let's go!   
     Fools!                     

15:42.800 --> 15:44.000
         Nonbelievers!          

15:44.100 --> 15:46.500
  Can't you see what this evil  
    machine has done?           

15:46.500 --> 15:48.000
     Look, you're trapped!      

15:48.100 --> 15:50.600
  You're spending every minute  
of every day in this bar.       

15:51.500 --> 15:52.900
    We always do that.          

15:53.000 --> 15:56.200
 Yeah, but now you're doing it  
          standing up.          

15:57.300 --> 15:58.100
NORM:                           
Ooh,                            

15:58.200 --> 16:00.100
     that is kind of eerie.     

16:00.200 --> 16:01.900
FRASIER:                        
Oh, Carla!                      

16:02.000 --> 16:04.900
     This machine does not      
    have a demonic capacity!    

16:05.000 --> 16:06.500
        Even if it did,         
    what could it do to you?    

16:06.500 --> 16:07.700
  It's got a tiny little ball.  

16:07.800 --> 16:09.500
            It's got these-these
             little plastic men.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.200
    Or do you suppose that if   
you, you stick your hand here   

16:12.200 --> 16:14.000
                  into the goal,
          it'll bite it off? Ow!

16:14.000 --> 16:14.500
        (screams)               

16:14.500 --> 16:16.000
         (men laughing)         

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
                         See?   

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
                I'm just playing
          on your superstitions.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.600
     Hey. Hey, my hand's caught.

16:23.700 --> 16:24.800
     (Norm and Cliff laugh)     

16:24.900 --> 16:26.100
                    No, no, it's
                  really caught.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.300
    I know, that's why          
        we're laughing.         

16:31.100 --> 16:33.200
        Oh, good, Woody, did you
         deliver the note there?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.600
  Uh, yeah. Well, I-I couldn't  
        find Miss Hill,         

16:35.700 --> 16:37.700
    so I waited around          
      a while and ended up      

16:37.800 --> 16:39.200
    leaving it with Reuben,     
          the busboy.           

16:39.300 --> 16:40.700
          Oh, good, thanks, man.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.000
 Yeah, he's-he's really looking 
    forward to the weekend.     

16:43.000 --> 16:44.700
        He wants to know        
      what he should wear.      

16:47.600 --> 16:49.300
            Woody, Woody, didn't
                 you tell Reuben

16:49.400 --> 16:50.800
  that the note was for Valerie?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.800
            Oh, Sam,            
    I didn't have the heart.    

16:52.900 --> 16:54.100
        He was so happy.        

16:54.200 --> 16:55.800
     He was walking on air.     

16:57.600 --> 17:00.500
     Sam, this isn't fair.      

17:00.600 --> 17:02.600
         It's one thing         
      to string me along,       

17:02.700 --> 17:05.800
    but our busboy, Reuben,     
 is in a very vulnerable state. 

17:07.200 --> 17:09.000
        He just split up        
     with the pastry chef.      

17:09.099 --> 17:10.500
    No, Valerie! Wait!          

17:10.599 --> 17:11.700
                      Val, wait!

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
  That note wasn't for Reuben.  

17:12.900 --> 17:14.000
     That note was for you.     

17:14.099 --> 17:15.700
I don't understand.             

17:15.800 --> 17:17.099
You just brushed me off.        

17:17.200 --> 17:18.200
          Oh, no, no, that was--

17:18.200 --> 17:19.900
            I just had a problem
            with the kegs there.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.500
              Did that seem like
             a brush-off to you?

17:21.599 --> 17:23.500
                      I'm sorry.
        See, I wouldn't know.   

17:23.599 --> 17:24.900
              I've never brushed
              anyone off before.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.900
                        (scoffs)

17:29.100 --> 17:31.400
              Listen, I-I really
                 like you a lot,

17:31.400 --> 17:32.800
  and I'd like to see you again.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.000
  You know, maybe we could go up
      to the Cape for a weekend.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.200
    What do you say? I hear it's
        really nice up there.   

17:37.200 --> 17:39.200
                I wouldn't know.
I've never been there myself.   

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
                        (scoffs)

17:47.000 --> 17:48.100
        What do you say?        

17:48.200 --> 17:49.500
        Gee, it sounds like fun.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.200
      Good. All right, uh,      
         just make sure         

17:51.300 --> 17:52.500
         you don't tell         
    your father, all right?     

17:52.500 --> 17:54.000
                      Good idea.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.500
            You know, you may   
            not believe this,   

17:55.600 --> 17:57.900
      but I get the feeling he'd
        rather I didn't see you.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.700
Oh, well, that's not the        
problem, really. It's just that 

17:59.800 --> 18:01.600
I don't like to do my           
romantic stuff in public.       

18:06.300 --> 18:07.900
                I don't know,   
          you seemed so forward.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.700
              You had me sitting
     on your lap and everything.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.000
        I'm sorry.              
     Did that seem forward?     

18:12.100 --> 18:14.000
I wouldn't know. I've never done
anything like that before.      

18:14.100 --> 18:16.000
        (scoffs)                
            (scoffs)            
                        (scoffs)

18:20.800 --> 18:23.100
         What's wrong with them?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.400
         Oh, uh, well,          
  the blonde has bad sinuses.   

18:26.500 --> 18:28.400
        The rest of them        
    just have bad attitudes!    

18:36.600 --> 18:38.500
            I feel so stupid.   

18:40.300 --> 18:43.200
         I can't believe my hand
is stuck in this stupid hole.   

18:43.300 --> 18:45.500
    Breathe easy, Doc.          

18:45.500 --> 18:47.100
I brought an expert to help you.

18:47.200 --> 18:47.900
             Great!             

18:51.000 --> 18:52.900
CARLA:                          
Okay, Father.                   

18:53.000 --> 18:54.700
         Get out your holy water

18:54.800 --> 18:57.700
        and cast Satan from that
            foosball machine.   

18:57.800 --> 19:00.400
      Carla, I didn't come      
    to perform an exorcism.     

19:00.400 --> 19:02.800
I came because you told me      
that-that you had a friend      

19:02.800 --> 19:04.500
who was thinking of converting. 

19:04.600 --> 19:05.900
            Oh, he will, Father.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.900
                Go with me on   
                 this one, Fras.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.100
                      But first,
            you have to exorcise

19:11.200 --> 19:12.300
            this foosball table.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.200
     Carla, it may surprise     
          you to learn          

19:14.300 --> 19:17.400
    that since Vatican Two,     
the church does not accept      

19:17.500 --> 19:20.100
        the existence of        
     Satanically-possessed      

19:20.100 --> 19:22.000
      amusement machines.       

19:23.700 --> 19:26.000
        First you dump Latin,   
                and now this.   

19:26.100 --> 19:28.400
              What do we pay you
            guys for, anyway?   

19:28.500 --> 19:29.700
Well, I know                    

19:29.700 --> 19:31.100
      exactly what to do.       

19:31.100 --> 19:33.400
    You relax and put           
    your faith in me.           

19:33.500 --> 19:35.000
  You do trust me, don't you?   

19:35.000 --> 19:35.800
      Absolutely, Father.       

19:35.900 --> 19:37.000
             Good!              

19:37.100 --> 19:39.300
        (screams)               

19:39.400 --> 19:40.800
            (moans)             

19:40.900 --> 19:43.300
        My thumb!               

19:43.400 --> 19:47.300
    Offer the pain up to God    
  for the poor souls, my son.   

19:47.400 --> 19:49.600
             What?!             

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
                I think you just
            lost one, Father.   

19:53.200 --> 19:55.000
        Boy, it was hard        
     sneaking out of there,     

19:55.100 --> 19:57.100
but I don't think he saw me.    

19:57.200 --> 19:59.800
      Good. So you're sure, now,
    your father doesn't know?   

19:59.900 --> 20:01.100
      Oh, Dad stepped out.      

20:01.200 --> 20:02.500
I meant Reuben the busboy.      

20:02.600 --> 20:04.000
      He's still in tears.      

20:05.800 --> 20:07.500
              You know, I really
            feel bad about that.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.800
                  Maybe I should
             send him something.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.100
Why don't we just get up        
to the car here, all right?     

20:12.100 --> 20:14.500
        Sam, I'd like to freshen
             up before we leave.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.800
Oh, well, all right.            
I'll meet you up at the car.    

20:16.900 --> 20:18.200
                     Uh, Sam.   
      Yeah?                     

20:18.300 --> 20:20.500
         I like the way         
     your hair smells, too.     

20:20.600 --> 20:22.000
         Oh, thank you.         

20:23.900 --> 20:26.800
    She's really nice,          
    isn't she, Woody?           

20:26.800 --> 20:30.200
          Oh, she's really nice.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.400
              And sweet and warm
                  and wonderful.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.700
             Yeah?              
                        Yeah.   

20:33.800 --> 20:34.900
                Back in Hanover,

20:34.900 --> 20:36.700
    me and my brother           
      used to have a name       

20:36.800 --> 20:38.500
     for a girl like that.      
Yeah, what's that?              

20:38.600 --> 20:40.000
                    Mom.        

20:42.800 --> 20:44.400
                By the way, Sam,
             if I ever catch you

20:44.400 --> 20:46.000
        anywhere near my mother,
            you'd better pray   

20:46.100 --> 20:48.000
 that God takes you before I do.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.600
            Oh, Sam.            

20:51.600 --> 20:53.500
        I've written up         
    a new agreement stating     

20:53.600 --> 20:56.000
that since you've agreed        
to never see my daughter again, 

20:56.100 --> 20:58.900
you now have full use           
of the poolroom...              

20:58.900 --> 21:00.400
That's funny,                   
that looks just like            

21:00.400 --> 21:01.600
my daughter's suitcase.         

21:01.700 --> 21:02.900
                No, that's mine.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.500
          You know what they say
                 at the airport:

21:04.500 --> 21:06.600
      "Many bags do look alike."

21:06.700 --> 21:09.100
Isn't that                      
her monogram: V.H.?             

21:09.200 --> 21:12.400
    Uh, actually I think it used
         to belong to Van Halen.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.300
Sam, indulge me.                

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
You're telling me               
this is your suitcase,          

21:20.500 --> 21:23.600
so by extension,                
would this be your negligee?    

21:23.600 --> 21:25.300
                      All right,
            the secret's out.   

21:25.300 --> 21:28.100
    I'm a transvestite, John.   

21:28.100 --> 21:29.900
    And a size seven?           

21:30.000 --> 21:31.700
      A guy can dream, can't he?

21:33.700 --> 21:36.100
Sam, you are not                
a transvestite.                 

21:36.200 --> 21:38.300
      Hey, hey, those are       
    fighting words there...     

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
                          Daddy?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.300
     Daddy, you may as well     
        know the truth.         

21:41.300 --> 21:44.900
    I'm going away with Sam     
  to the Cape for the weekend.  

21:45.000 --> 21:47.400
             I see.             

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
      Well, since there's       
nothing I can do about it,      

21:49.600 --> 21:51.000
I'll give you my blessing.      

21:51.000 --> 21:53.100
          Really?               

21:53.200 --> 21:54.400
        Darling, I have         
     complete faith in you.     

21:54.400 --> 21:57.200
  If this is the man you want,  
that's good enough for me.      

21:57.200 --> 21:58.700
          Wait, all right, wait.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.400
            I see what you're   
                     doing here.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.900
  Yeah, y-you think... you think
    that I just wanted to go out

22:02.900 --> 22:04.800
    with your daughter 'cause   
    you said that I couldn't.   

22:04.900 --> 22:06.200
                    And now that
              you say it's okay,

22:06.200 --> 22:07.500
              you're hoping that
                I won't want to.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.700
          Well, that won't work,
      because I really like her.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.000
                So forget it.   
            Come on, Valerie.   

22:11.100 --> 22:12.000
                    Let's go.   

22:12.100 --> 22:13.500
    Gee, I don't know, Sam.     

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
                      Why? What?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.000
Well, it seemed                 
really exciting                 

22:18.100 --> 22:20.500
when Daddy didn't               
want me to date you.            

22:20.500 --> 22:23.000
But now, I don't know.          

22:23.100 --> 22:25.700
It just seems like I'd be       
dating some greasy bartender.   

22:27.700 --> 22:28.600
                 Excuse me?     

22:28.700 --> 22:30.000
    Well...                     

22:30.000 --> 22:31.700
Really, you're not              
exactly my type.                

22:31.800 --> 22:33.800
          Oh, hey, don't you see
                what he's doing?

22:33.800 --> 22:34.900
Please, Sam.                    

22:35.000 --> 22:37.100
Let's not prolong this.         

22:37.200 --> 22:39.700
The smell of your hair          
is making me queasy.            

22:41.700 --> 22:43.000
     Well, Sam,                 

22:43.000 --> 22:44.500
since you've broken             
the agreement,                  

22:44.500 --> 22:46.200
it seems that once again I have 

22:46.300 --> 22:48.400
legal title                     
to your poolroom                

22:48.500 --> 22:50.200
and your bathrooms.             

22:50.200 --> 22:52.400
I'll be expecting the rent      

22:52.400 --> 22:54.100
promptly at the first           
of every month.                 

22:54.100 --> 22:55.600
        Oh, by the way,         

22:55.700 --> 22:57.700
    I'm doubling the amount.    

22:57.700 --> 22:59.500
            Have a good evening.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
        Oh, he's so bad!        

23:01.700 --> 23:03.400
I hate him!                     

23:03.500 --> 23:04.600
    I hate his whole family!    

23:04.700 --> 23:06.100
        I hate everybody        
      he's ever talked to!      

23:06.100 --> 23:08.400
  Well, you know, I may not be  
 able to take his daughter out, 

23:08.500 --> 23:10.300
and I may have to pay him       
        his stupid rent,        

23:10.400 --> 23:12.200
        but I can still         
    hit him where it hurts.     

23:12.200 --> 23:13.400
Yeah, you know something?       

23:13.400 --> 23:14.900
    This is the busiest time    
in his restaurant, right?       

23:15.000 --> 23:15.900
          Watch this.           

23:16.000 --> 23:17.500
          Hey, Reuben,          
         get your coat!         

23:17.600 --> 23:19.500
      We're going dancing!      

23:20.305 --> 23:26.410
