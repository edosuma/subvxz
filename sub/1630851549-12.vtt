WEBVTT

00:11.881 --> 00:13.230
Morning, Baker.

00:13.274 --> 00:16.016
Archbishop Kearns
is in your office, waiting.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.067
Finally.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.200
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What're you doing here?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.636
I couldn't sleep.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.899
Clearly.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.815
Thank you.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.256
So?

00:41.693 --> 00:44.740
I saw your press conference
last night, Frank.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.698
The one where
you announced an arrest

00:46.742 --> 00:48.222
in the Stephanie Miller case.

00:48.265 --> 00:51.486
Yeah, we arrested a guy,
Lamar White. What about it?

00:51.529 --> 00:53.270
He didn't do it.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.493
His fingerprints were
on the knife, and he confessed.

00:58.536 --> 01:02.410
Somebody else murdered
Stephanie Miller.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.020
Oh?

01:04.064 --> 01:06.849
Trust me.
You've got the wrong man.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.112
That's all you need to know.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.771
This came from a confession.

01:15.814 --> 01:19.166
I cannot confirm or deny that.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.037
So, yes.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.300
Well, your confessor
might be lying.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.476
People don't lie
in the confessional, Frank.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.391
Kevin, if you're not
gonna tell me who it is,

01:27.435 --> 01:29.001
why'd you
bring it to me?

01:29.045 --> 01:31.874
Because I can't sit by and watch
an innocent man take a fall.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.571
Potentially innocent man,

01:33.615 --> 01:36.226
and unless you give me
a name, I can't help you.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.186
I thought I could
count on you for your help.

01:39.229 --> 01:42.754
Well, the Lord helps those
who help themselves,

01:42.798 --> 01:44.887
so give me the name
of your confessor,

01:44.930 --> 01:46.671
and I'll see what I can do.

01:46.715 --> 01:47.933
Frank, we're talking
about statutory,

01:47.977 --> 01:49.587
evidentiary privilege.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.633
I can't give you that name,
and you know it.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.246
Then I can't help you.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.906
Did I ever say that to you

02:03.949 --> 02:06.735
when you came to me for help?

02:06.778 --> 02:08.476
Never.

02:18.399 --> 02:21.489
Word is you're by the book,
but fair.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.968
Locker room translation,
ball buster.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.622
Whoa. See that guy?
He just ran that stop sign.

02:24.666 --> 02:25.884
We're really gonna
pull him over?

02:25.928 --> 02:27.495
- What's the problem?
- We're not traffic cops.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.211
Shut it off.
License and registration.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.432
Hey, Officer. Look, man,
I didn't do anything.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.349
Run it.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.915
Where you going
in such a hurry?

02:56.959 --> 02:59.396
Okay, I didn't see
the stop sign.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.659
- You own this car?
- No, it's my boss's car.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.748
Look, please, Officer,
- I'm gonna be late.
Hey, Sarge.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.361
He's got an outstanding
felony warrant.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.581
Sir, step out
of the car, please.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.322
It was a mistake... Let's go. Right now.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.238
Out. Come on.
On the back of the car.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.720
- You're under arrest.
- Cuff him up.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.025
Make sure you
give him a toss.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.555
You got a lot of cash
in the backseat.

03:27.598 --> 03:28.904
You want to tell me
what that's about?

03:28.947 --> 03:31.602
I want a lawyer.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.561
What was that you said
about being traffic cops?

03:36.128 --> 03:38.957
- About time.
- Well, I brought you a coffee.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.394
Nice of you
to show up, Reagan.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.352
We got a fresh one under
the Williamsburg Bridge.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.745
Uh, actually, boss, could you

03:43.788 --> 03:45.137
give it to Peterson
and Covino?

03:45.181 --> 03:46.965
- 'Cause I caught another case.
- No.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.445
You and Baez
are up next.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.666
Okay, but I got another case
I got to look into first.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.755
- What other case?
- I can't tell you.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.278
Excuse me?

03:55.322 --> 03:58.107
It came from
a confidential source.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.109
- Who's the source?
- I can't tell you.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.633
- Says who?
- Says One PP.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.680
Oh, I see where
this is going... It's not what you think it is.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.508
Daddy's the PC.
- I get it.
- No.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.161
That's not it...

04:09.205 --> 04:10.554
Look, if you want
the truth,

04:10.598 --> 04:12.513
Lieutenant Gormley came to me.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.776
Gormley should've came to me.
I'm the boss.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.908
I'm sure he didn't mean
any disrespect.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.170
Could've fooled me.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.350
Madeline Gleeson?

04:23.393 --> 04:25.352
- Yeah.
- I'm Officer Janko.

04:25.395 --> 04:28.137
This is Officer Badillo.
You called 911?

04:28.180 --> 04:31.140
I want to report a rape.

04:33.142 --> 04:36.232
Okay. May we come in?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.103
Yeah.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.590
You want to tell us
what happened.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.853
I met this guy for a date.

04:48.897 --> 04:52.292
We went to Martello's
on-on Madison.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.337
Got some drinks.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.035
He was really nice, at first.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.081
And then we
went back to...

04:59.124 --> 05:01.431
his apartment...

05:01.475 --> 05:04.521
I-I got up to go,

05:04.565 --> 05:07.916
and he-he blocked the door.

05:07.959 --> 05:12.181
I-I kind of pushed him
and said no.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.444
He got really aggressive.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.361
How do you know him?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.537
We met online.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.539
Was this your first date?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.499
Yeah.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.718
We need his name
and his address.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.199
Mark Roland.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.854
One second.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.597
Left your sweater
at my place.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.425
- Get away from me.
- Listen to me.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.513
That's him.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.036
That's the one who raped me.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.038
- I didn't rape you.
- Back up.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.736
Turn around.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.825
Hands behind your back.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.262
I know my rights.
I'm a lawyer.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.395
I don't care who you are.
You're under arrest for rape.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.223
Let's go.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.360
We got one under on
an outstanding warrant.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.058
Have him sign for the funds and
voucher the rest as personals.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.320
- You got it, boss.
- Yeah.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.582
Hey, Jamie.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.584
Hey, Joe. What's going on?

06:07.628 --> 06:09.847
Actually, you tell me.
Come here.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.722
You picked up Manuel Ruiz?

06:14.765 --> 06:16.376
On an outstanding warrant. Why?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.942
I'm working on
an FBI task force.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.075
This is my boss, Jeff Green.
- He's group supervisor.
- Hey.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.642
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.252
We're working a case,
and Ruiz is one of our targets.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.514
That was drug money
he had in his car.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.037
We think he was gonna use it
to make a buy.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.561
So, we'll take the arrest.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.563
Uh...
Uh, what's the plan here?

06:29.606 --> 06:30.868
We were going to
follow him

06:30.912 --> 06:32.522
and collar him
after he made the exchange.

06:32.566 --> 06:33.697
- And now?
- And now, we'll convince him

06:33.741 --> 06:35.220
- to cooperate.
- How you gonna do that?

06:35.264 --> 06:36.526
He already asked for a lawyer.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.919
When we tell him we're gonna

06:37.962 --> 06:39.703
take the money and release him
without a receipt,

06:39.747 --> 06:41.139
he'll be begging us
to cooperate.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.880
You're gonna take the money,

06:42.924 --> 06:44.491
but you're not gonna
give him a receipt?

06:44.534 --> 06:45.753
Bosses will kill him for that.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.407
Which is why
he'll agree to cooperate.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.496
So, you're threatening his life
if he doesn't cooperate?

06:49.539 --> 06:50.801
We're giving him incentive.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.281
Is that what you call it?

06:54.457 --> 06:55.632
We'll take it from here.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.374
I don't think so.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.767
What?

06:59.810 --> 07:01.421
It's my arrest.
- You can't have him.
- What?

07:01.464 --> 07:02.857
Malone.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.424
When you're done,
- put Ruiz in the cell.
- Copy that.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.990
- What are you doing?
- My job.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.339
This is a fed case.
You can't do that.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.558
I'll take this all the way
up to the director.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.646
You can take it
wherever you want.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.433
I thought you said
this guy was okay.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.523
Jamie, what the hell
are you doing?

07:16.566 --> 07:18.089
I just started
on this task force.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.613
You're blowing my first case
out of the water.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.832
We don't threaten people's lives
to get them to cooperate.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.138
- "We"?
- We don't purposely

07:23.181 --> 07:24.487
withhold a receipt
from a drug courier

07:24.531 --> 07:26.054
knowing they'll put
a price on his head.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.577
Are you kidding me? "W-We"?

07:27.621 --> 07:31.146
J-- I'm not a part of you.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.873
You have any gang affiliations?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.397
No.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.921
Tattoos?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.842
Just this one.

08:14.885 --> 08:15.799
"Milagro"?

08:15.843 --> 08:18.889
My daughter. It means "miracle."

08:21.805 --> 08:22.763
Is this her?

08:22.806 --> 08:24.373
Yeah.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.636
And my wife.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.333
Mm-hmm.

08:28.377 --> 08:32.294
My wife and I saved up
to buy a place in Orlando.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.165
My daughter
loves Disney.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.559
You're telling me the $32,000
in the backseat

08:36.603 --> 08:37.908
was for the place
in Orlando?

08:37.952 --> 08:39.301
We're gonna move there.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.998
Right, so it's just
a coincidence that you have

08:41.042 --> 08:42.957
drug possession with intent
to sell charges pending?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.264
My lawyer told me
not to talk to you.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.439
You can do
whatever you want,

08:47.483 --> 08:49.529
but if you don't make
a deal to cooperate,

08:49.572 --> 08:51.574
she's gonna be in college
by the time you get out.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.534
You're just trying to scare me.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.537
You should be scared.
You're looking at serious time.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.712
Let me ask you
something.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.019
Why didn't you hand me over
to the Feds?

09:02.063 --> 09:04.848
Is that what you want? You want
me to hand you over to the Feds?

09:04.892 --> 09:06.763
No. Man, I just don't understand
why you want to help me.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.246
Here's why.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.207
Think about them.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.562
Were you first
- on the scene?
- Yeah.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.737
What did you see?

09:23.780 --> 09:25.303
When I walked in,
I saw Stephanie Miller

09:25.347 --> 09:27.175
lying there,
covered in blood.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.785
And Lamar White? Where was he?

09:28.829 --> 09:31.309
He was holding her with one arm,
had the knife in his other hand.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.355
Did he say anything?

09:33.398 --> 09:35.792
He kept saying to me, "Did
I kill her? Did I kill her?"

09:35.836 --> 09:38.882
Huh.
No signs of
forced entry?

09:38.926 --> 09:41.624
No, but the window
was open, like halfway.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.409
So, you would say
he was cooperative?

09:44.453 --> 09:46.673
I'd say the guy was in shock.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.457
Anything else
you can tell us?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.720
I know this sounds weird,
but he was hysterical,

09:50.764 --> 09:51.939
like he really
loved her.

09:51.982 --> 09:55.246
Okay, well, we'll take
a look around. Thanks.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.297
You got something?

10:02.340 --> 10:03.820
Maybe.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.345
Hidden camera.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.869
Memory card's
missing.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.522
Crime Scene didn't recover that.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.786
I would've noticed it
in their evidence log.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.439
Maybe she planted it

10:14.483 --> 10:16.006
in case something
like this ever happened.

10:16.050 --> 10:19.357
Or maybe he planted it and
saw something he didn't like.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.446
Something that would
give him motive

10:21.490 --> 10:23.971
to commit murder maybe?

10:28.497 --> 10:29.629
Hey!

10:31.500 --> 10:33.241
Good afternoon,
Officer Janko.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.938
What is going on?
Who told you you could leave?

10:34.982 --> 10:36.592
This is the officer
who arrested me.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.289
I'm Mr. Roland's attorney.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.335
He should've never been arrested
in the first place.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.641
He raped a young woman.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.643
The D.A.'s office
is declining to prosecute.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.254
No, that-that's not possible.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.082
You have an issue with that,
take it up with them.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.605
Let's go.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.912
Take care, Officer Janko.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.658
And the 6-5 felonies
are down across the board

10:58.701 --> 10:59.746
for the last month.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.444
Great. Set up a call
with the C.O.

11:02.487 --> 11:03.488
Will do.

11:03.532 --> 11:04.664
On that other case, I got

11:04.707 --> 11:05.882
someone looking into it, boss,

11:05.926 --> 11:08.929
but nothing to
substantiate yet.
Okay.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.193
What case?

11:12.236 --> 11:14.108
Nothing.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.416
Doesn't concern you.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.376
So, a secret case?

11:21.419 --> 11:22.899
No, no.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.729
Who's looking into
this secret case?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.600
Why're you giving me
the third degree?

11:28.644 --> 11:30.254
Why are you avoiding
the question?

11:30.298 --> 11:33.867
This has something to do
with Archbishop Kearns.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.826
You're looking into
a case for Kearns?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.698
A secret case?

11:42.397 --> 11:44.007
This isn't exactly kosher.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.531
Okay. Garrett, Abigail,

11:46.575 --> 11:47.924
give us the room.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.726
And, Sid, I appreciate you
talking to Danny,

12:06.769 --> 12:09.511
but I don't want you to have
any more involvement in this.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.296
Hey, once an altar boy, I'm in.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.863
But,

12:13.907 --> 12:16.518
if it ever gets out that
we're even looking into this,

12:16.561 --> 12:19.042
based on the hearsay
of the archbishop,

12:19.086 --> 12:21.262
we'd be ripped to shreds
in the press.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.221
Then we proceed very quietly.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.572
And Danny's on board with this?

12:27.616 --> 12:28.835
The case against
Lamar White

12:28.878 --> 12:31.011
is pretty rock solid,

12:31.054 --> 12:32.752
so it'd sure as hell
help to find out

12:32.795 --> 12:34.318
who the guy is
that confessed.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.973
Danny wants to get ahold
of security cameras.

12:37.017 --> 12:40.281
Oh, archbishop's
never gonna go for that.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.936
But, boss, we have access to all
the other security cameras

12:42.979 --> 12:44.415
surrounding the church.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.942
And we don't need
the archbishop's permission

12:48.985 --> 12:50.247
to see them.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.771
But if we go that route,

12:51.814 --> 12:54.469
you'll alienate
the archbishop completely.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.129
I know, Sid, I know.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.265
You let a rapist walk?

13:08.309 --> 13:09.745
Excuse me?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.529
You dismissed the case
against Mark Roland.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.794
First of all,
that was not my case.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.448
Secondly, I happen to agree
with the assessment.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.798
You agree?

13:18.841 --> 13:20.451
Yeah. It'd be
almost impossible

13:20.495 --> 13:22.758
to prove that case
beyond reasonable doubt.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.935
Roland said it was consensual,
witnesses saw them kissing,

13:25.979 --> 13:28.155
Gleeson willingly went up
to that apartment,

13:28.198 --> 13:30.113
there was large amounts
of alcohol...

13:30.157 --> 13:31.898
So, Erin, if you go up
to a man's apartment,

13:31.941 --> 13:33.160
you're asking
to be raped?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.466
Uh... I did not say that.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.643
Okay, we cannot prosecute a case
if we do not believe

13:38.687 --> 13:40.994
we can prove it
beyond reasonable doubt.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.299
So, you're just gonna let it go?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.171
You're not gonna try
to investigate to see

13:44.214 --> 13:46.695
if the case has merit?
'Cause you know what?

13:46.738 --> 13:49.393
The case has merit. I know it.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.830
Well, good for you,
but I can't use

13:50.873 --> 13:52.483
your gut instinct as evidence.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.312
You're screwing over
- a victim here.
- Okay, you're out of line.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.444
No, you are.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.619
You are!
I have to go up

13:57.662 --> 13:58.925
to Madeline Gleeson

13:58.968 --> 14:01.841
and say, "I'm so sorry
that you were raped,

14:01.884 --> 14:04.147
but nothing
is gonna happen to Roland."

14:05.322 --> 14:07.324
Thanks for nothing, Erin!

14:19.467 --> 14:21.295
Hey, yo, my man,
I already told you,

14:21.338 --> 14:24.472
my boss gave me the $32,000
to buy a brick of fentanyl.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.865
That was the money
you had on the backseat

14:25.908 --> 14:27.649
- when you got pulled over?
- Yeah.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.564
I was supposed to deliver it
to some guy in the Bronx.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.695
What guy?

14:32.915 --> 14:35.091
His name is Manny Lopez.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.791
We're gonna need you
to arrange to drop off

14:39.835 --> 14:41.924
the money in exchange
for the fentanyl.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.360
Then, we'll move in

14:43.404 --> 14:45.797
and make the arrest
after the exchange is made.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.190
The deal was for
a reduced sentence

14:47.234 --> 14:48.757
in exchange
for information.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.411
Now, you're talking about
doing a drug transaction.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.195
That's a lot more
dangerous.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.328
- That's the deal.
- Take it or leave it.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.639
All right.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.166
I'll do it under
one condition.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.297
Okay. What's that?

15:09.299 --> 15:11.388
Sergeant Reagan
is my point person.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.398
All right, well, I want
to read that testimony

15:21.442 --> 15:23.444
before I sign off on the plea.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.750
Okay, thanks.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.666
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.233
This is
Madeline Gleeson.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.888
Thank you so much
for meeting

15:32.932 --> 15:35.412
with me, Ms. Reagan.
I-I really appreciate it.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.501
- Oh.
- I knew that you wanted to hear

15:37.545 --> 15:39.764
firsthand the details
from Madeline,

15:39.808 --> 15:42.071
so we could figure out a way
to get her justice.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.507
So what do you
think's best?

15:43.551 --> 15:46.119
In here or
in the conference room?

15:53.778 --> 15:54.736
Hey.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.217
Hey, Jamie.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.436
He asked to work with you?
What did you say to the guy?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.525
Nothing. Maybe I just
treated him with respect.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.223
Great. Could you treat me
with a little respect, please?

16:03.266 --> 16:05.529
Let's not forget I'm the reason
that he's cooperating.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.749
My team has been all over
this case, all right?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.099
We've been following this guy
- for the last three weeks.
- Congratulations.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.883
I don't understand
what the problem is here.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.276
I don't like the way
your team operates.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.408
Well, they make a lot
of good collars.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.844
Are all those
good collars legit,

16:15.887 --> 16:17.367
or are they like Ruiz?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.456
Strong-arming and bullying
people to get what you want?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.111
I didn't realize you were
so invested in perps.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.462
I'm invested in operating
by the book.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.334
We're not doing
anything illegal.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.813
Fine. Let's just say
I like being able

16:28.857 --> 16:30.990
to look myself
in the mirror in the morning.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.948
Now I know why Danny
calls you a Boy Scout.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.341
Hey!

16:34.384 --> 16:36.125
Before, you said
you're not one of us, right?

16:36.169 --> 16:38.432
Well, I think you're
absolutely right. You're not.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.956
You're nothing like your father.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.526
Okay, and this is the best
number to reach you at?

16:45.569 --> 16:46.962
- Yes.
- Okay, well,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.442
I will be in touch.

16:48.485 --> 16:52.315
If you can wait for Detective--
Uh... Officer Janko

16:52.359 --> 16:53.795
at the elevators,
please.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.362
Okay.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.410
And thanks

17:00.454 --> 17:02.108
again. I...

17:02.151 --> 17:04.371
I can't tell you how much
this means to me,

17:04.414 --> 17:07.069
you taking a personal
interest and all.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.028
My pleasure.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.473
- Don't be mad.
- Don't be mad?

17:19.516 --> 17:21.953
I don't even know
where to start.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.259
How could youdo that?

17:23.303 --> 17:24.869
How could you bring her
in here, unannounced,

17:24.913 --> 17:26.436
without even
checking with me?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.308
I just thought that if you heard
her story firsthand...

17:28.351 --> 17:29.831
I know her story.
I read the complaint.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.137
She's devastated, Erin.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.530
This is not about
sympathizing with victims,

17:33.574 --> 17:35.054
it's about being able
to prove a rape,

17:35.097 --> 17:36.794
and right now, we don't have
enough evidence, Eddie.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.579
Then let's get
enough evidence.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.102
What do you need?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.191
I need you to get out
of my office.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.586
Now.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.562
How you doing,
Lamar?

18:05.606 --> 18:07.086
I'm Detective Reagan.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.913
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.829
Hey.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.919
What happened to your lip?

18:14.963 --> 18:18.619
I think I'm supposed
to say I fell.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.447
Lamar, we're looking into
your girlfriend

18:20.490 --> 18:22.188
Stephanie Miller's murder.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.146
We have a few questions for you.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.192
How long did you date her?

18:26.235 --> 18:29.543
We met in March,
moved in together in July.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.762
That's pretty quick.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.938
I knew she was the one
after the first date.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.506
Did you know she had
a hidden camera

18:36.550 --> 18:38.117
installed in the apartment?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.814
For what?

18:39.857 --> 18:41.685
We were hoping
you could tell us.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.513
Nah. No way,
that wasn't her style.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.993
She didn't like security?

18:45.036 --> 18:47.952
She didn't like when people
put cameras everywhere.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.564
She was a really private person.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.436
Did you install
the smoke detector for her,

18:53.480 --> 18:54.829
or did she do it herself?

18:54.872 --> 18:55.960
The building put those in.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.005
They send someone
to check on it

18:57.048 --> 18:59.007
every six monthsor so.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.269
Do you know who?

19:00.313 --> 19:02.097
I was never there when he came.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.186
You could ask the super.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.971
Do you know if there was anyone
who bothered Stephanie,

19:07.015 --> 19:09.017
creeped her out?

19:09.060 --> 19:10.366
Not really.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.107
Anyone who ever scared her?

19:16.503 --> 19:19.158
She told me about a guy she
caught looking in her window.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.422
- Hmm.
- Like a Peeping Tom?

19:22.465 --> 19:24.250
She called me all scared.
I told her to call the cops.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.078
- And did she?
- No. He left.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.863
Did she describe this guy?

19:28.906 --> 19:32.171
Tall, like six feet,

19:32.214 --> 19:35.348
blonde hair, stocky. Why?

19:35.391 --> 19:38.873
We're just looking into
a few things.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.791
Lamar,
in your statement,

19:43.834 --> 19:45.662
you told detectives

19:45.706 --> 19:47.838
that you stabbed
Stephanie to death.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.625
- So?
- So, you confessed,

19:51.668 --> 19:53.496
but did you do it?

19:55.498 --> 19:56.673
I must've.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.502
You must've?

19:59.546 --> 20:02.157
- What does that mean?
- It means we were drinking.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.813
I did shots, too many.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.380
I blacked out.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.514
When I woke up, Steph was dead.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.994
There was blood everywhere.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.648
But you don't remember
if you did it?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.824
Does it matter, hmm?

20:16.867 --> 20:19.261
If I was blacked out
and killed her,

20:19.305 --> 20:21.698
or if I was blacked out
and didn't save her.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.311
Either way, I'm guilty.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.711
Hey.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.844
I know she told you
what she did.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.672
- Who?
- Eddie.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.978
- Oh.
- Oh?

20:41.022 --> 20:43.024
That's all you have
to say, is "oh"?

20:43.067 --> 20:46.027
Look, she got overly
invested in the case,

20:46.070 --> 20:47.550
happens to the
best of us.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.466
Yeah, but you talk to me
about it. You don't just...

20:50.510 --> 20:52.642
What? Pull a Reagan?

20:52.686 --> 20:54.253
Pull a Reagan?

20:54.296 --> 20:56.037
What's that
supposed to mean?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.518
She used any means
necessary.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.041
Some might say
unorthodox.

21:00.084 --> 21:03.349
Well, some might say rude
and unprofessional.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.525
To get your attention.
She knew you'd get invested

21:05.568 --> 21:06.874
once you talked
to the victim,

21:06.917 --> 21:09.268
and by the looks of it,
she was right.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.444
Well, who said
I was invested?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.923
Well, isn't that
why you're here?

21:12.967 --> 21:14.534
To tell me to dive
into this case?

21:14.577 --> 21:15.752
No.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.101
Then why are you here?

21:17.145 --> 21:19.843
To tell you to dive
into this case.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.410
But I still say

21:21.454 --> 21:23.891
the way she went about it
was wrong.

21:23.934 --> 21:24.892
Hmm.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.763
Unbelievable.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.724
Okay, here's

21:30.767 --> 21:33.901
it's possible, but not provable.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.468
I told you.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.949
All I'm saying is his prints
could be on the knife

21:38.993 --> 21:40.951
because he touched it
after the fact.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.127
- So, you'll release him?
- Kevin,

21:43.171 --> 21:44.912
he still confessed,

21:44.955 --> 21:47.306
and his prints are still
on the murder weapon.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.921
So... who's your guy?

21:53.964 --> 21:56.793
We have to make this
right, Frank.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.971
You're gonna have to work
with me, Kevin.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.669
All I want is justice

22:02.712 --> 22:04.975
for Stephanie Miller
and her family,

22:05.019 --> 22:06.760
and to put her killer away.

22:06.803 --> 22:10.503
And he will be, just not by me.

22:10.546 --> 22:14.333
Why don't you tell that
to the dead girl's family?

22:17.814 --> 22:20.687
You don't think this
is killing me, Frank?

22:20.730 --> 22:23.385
But it's not my job
to do your work for you,

22:23.429 --> 22:25.909
and I'm not protecting
her killer.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.998
That's exactly
what you're doing, Kevin.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.914
Oh, no. I'm protecting
the seal of the confessional.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.177
That's my job.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.354
That's what I swore
an oath to do,

22:35.397 --> 22:36.616
and I'm okay with that.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.182
Well, I'm not.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.501
I can't remember working a case
where I was hoping the guy

22:52.545 --> 22:54.590
who I collared
didn't actually do it.

22:54.634 --> 22:57.724
What's the case?
It's, uh...

22:57.767 --> 23:00.335
No case.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.382
Hypothetical case.
That's why I can't remember.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.122
You going all soft on us?

23:05.166 --> 23:07.342
No, Gramps.
Still pissing people off.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.866
This week, it's my boss.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.912
Your C.O. mad at you?

23:11.955 --> 23:14.349
Well, actually, he's mad
at me and my former C.O.,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.046
but hopefully,
he'll get over that.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.223
Well, pissing people off
is a job hazard.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.487
Well, it doesn't have to be
if you do it right.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.619
Sometimes,
being passionate

23:23.663 --> 23:27.144
about your job
- pisses people off.
- Ah.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.711
Is that what
you're calling it?

23:28.755 --> 23:30.452
I think it's a,
it's a Reagan hazard.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.672
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ah, just means that

23:32.715 --> 23:34.848
I think, for some people,
we're a lot to take.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.284
What're you talking about?

23:36.327 --> 23:37.590
You know, we're strong,
opinionated, outspoken.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.809
Oh.
Stubborn, headstrong,

23:39.853 --> 23:42.421
- relentless.
- Table full of type A's.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.988
- That is true.
- Well, you're one of them.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.729
By marriage,
not by blood.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.252
What difference does that make?
Yeah.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.124
I think it makes
a very big difference.

23:50.167 --> 23:53.475
For instance, how often have you
or you gone into Erin's office

23:53.519 --> 23:55.608
to fight for a case,

23:55.651 --> 23:57.566
or a subpoena, or a warrant?

23:57.610 --> 23:59.089
Okay, so that's where
you're going with this?

23:59.133 --> 24:00.395
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.918
And, apparently, it's okay,
if you're blood.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.050
No. No.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.617
It's not okay,
and it's different

24:04.660 --> 24:06.140
than dragging a victim

24:06.183 --> 24:08.577
into my office
unannounced.

24:08.621 --> 24:11.667
Something going on here
we should know about?

24:11.711 --> 24:13.408
No.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.715
Look...

24:15.758 --> 24:18.282
being passionate, I mean,
whether you want to call it

24:18.326 --> 24:21.547
being type A or a Reagan hazard,

24:21.590 --> 24:23.853
I think it's commendable.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.508
Thank you.

24:26.552 --> 24:27.683
Yeah.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.380
I agree, Francis.

24:29.424 --> 24:30.599
Not everybody feels that way.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.036
Some Reagans don't even want
to be Reagans.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.909
You got to be talking about Joe.

24:35.952 --> 24:39.086
Yeah, we're working
the same case, and, uh,

24:39.129 --> 24:41.088
he's keeping it a secret
that we're related.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.132
No.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.091
Maybe he wants

24:44.134 --> 24:46.049
to keep it a secret 'cause
he's not sure he wants to be

24:46.093 --> 24:48.312
a part of this particular club.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.793
Well, don't count him out.
Yeah,

24:50.837 --> 24:53.535
and if all else fails, we'll
just bring in the big guns.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.972
- What's that?
- Irish Catholic guilt.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.408
Dad wrote the book on it.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.721
Thank you for coming in.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.070
ADA Reagan,

25:07.114 --> 25:08.550
the charges against
my client were dropped,

25:08.594 --> 25:10.117
so why are we here?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.119
I am supervising
this case.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.644
I just want to make sure my ADA
is doing her due diligence.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.124
I can save you the trouble.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.517
You have nothing.
Mark...

25:18.560 --> 25:20.910
She came to my place,
wanted to have sex with me.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.565
It's not my fault if she
had regrets afterwards.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.959
I wouldn't characterize
a rape charge

25:26.002 --> 25:27.787
as having regrets.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.877
What exactly do you need
from us, Ms. Reagan?

25:30.920 --> 25:33.357
Ms. Gleeson told us that
she said no several times.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.577
That she tried
physically to stop you.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.883
This is crazy.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.014
Did she say no?

25:38.058 --> 25:41.235
No. Do I look like a rapist?

25:41.278 --> 25:42.584
I don't know.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.238
What does a rapist look like?

25:44.281 --> 25:45.848
If you thought there
was any merit to this,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.458
Mr. Roland
would be in Rikers.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.591
Your office declined
to prosecute.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.375
Pending further investigation.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.812
You can do all the investigating you want.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.378
- We will.
- But, be assured,

25:54.422 --> 25:56.424
you won't find
any evidence I raped her.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.905
We came here as a courtesy,
but if you're gonna start

25:58.948 --> 26:00.863
to harass my client,
we're leaving.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.125
Let's go.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.920
So, what do you think?

26:13.963 --> 26:17.227
He never said that
he didn't rape Ms. Gleeson.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.621
He said there wasn't evidence
that he did.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.668
Well, he's a lawyer, so he knows
his way around the law,

26:22.711 --> 26:24.408
but he's cocky,

26:24.452 --> 26:26.323
which means he's probably
done this before.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.456
Doesn't have any priors.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.371
None filed.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.199
Dig deeper.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.072
So the super has
no knowledge

26:36.116 --> 26:37.900
of anyone installing
smoke detectors.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.903
Great. Anything on
our Peeping Tom?

26:40.947 --> 26:43.732
I pulled all the complaints
that may involve a Peeping Tom,

26:43.776 --> 26:46.387
thinking that maybe he's
targeted other women,

26:46.430 --> 26:48.650
- not just Stephanie.
- Okay. What'd you find?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.260
12 guys to check out.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.697
Do any of them
fit the description

26:51.740 --> 26:53.263
of <i>our</i> Peeping Tom?

26:53.307 --> 26:56.615
Six-foot tall,
blonde hair, stocky.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.920
No.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.402
Okay, well, maybe
our Peeping Tom

27:01.445 --> 27:03.012
is the guy who went
to confession

27:03.056 --> 27:05.754
with Archbishop Kearns on
the day of Stephanie's murder.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.583
It's not like the church keeps
a list of its penitents.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.717
No, but I could get access
to the security footage

27:11.760 --> 27:13.109
surrounding the church.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.634
How? Never mind.
I don't want to know.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.419
Look, how hard could it be
to find the footage

27:18.462 --> 27:21.117
of our Peeping Tom
walking into the church?

27:21.161 --> 27:23.859
Right. It's only the busiest
avenue in Manhattan.

27:23.903 --> 27:28.124
During a two-hour window
of confession.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.825
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.783
We found something
worth looking into.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.090
We?

27:37.133 --> 27:38.613
I invited Eddie
to come with me.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.180
So where is she?

27:40.223 --> 27:42.443
She thinks you might
still be mad at her.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.923
- She was scared to come up.
- Scared of me?

27:43.966 --> 27:45.098
Well, you can be scary.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.668
Okay, so what did we find?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.495
Our friend Roland had
an HR complaint

27:51.539 --> 27:53.410
lodged against him last year,

27:53.454 --> 27:56.022
and the law firm where
he worked as a third year.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.720
An HR complaint. I mean,
that could mean anything.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.722
He could've used
the wrong adjective.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.681
The complaint was found
to have merit.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.422
He was fired,
and his accuser resigned.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.859
What was the charge?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.251
Rape.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.431
How dare you!

28:16.259 --> 28:18.479
Archbishop Kearns
is here, sir.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.702
Thank you, Baker.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.970
You used the church, my church,

28:31.013 --> 28:32.449
in your investigation.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.191
No, we didn't.
We reinvestigated a case

28:35.235 --> 28:36.932
and narrowed down a suspect.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.195
You infiltrated
our security system.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.763
Did I ask for security
footage from you?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.373
No.

28:43.417 --> 28:45.462
Did I ask for the names
or descriptions

28:45.506 --> 28:47.029
of any of your flock?

28:47.073 --> 28:48.639
No.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.294
All you need to know is
I did what I had to do

28:51.338 --> 28:53.688
to put a murderer away.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.212
You can look at the surveillance
footage if you'd like.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.824
I will do no such thing.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.695
It's not my job
to put people away.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.525
No. Your job is to save souls,
and you do it well.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.962
My job is to get justice
for victims,

29:07.006 --> 29:08.921
and I do it equally well.

29:10.574 --> 29:14.535
Mm. How did you find him?

29:14.578 --> 29:17.407
We got a description.

29:17.451 --> 29:18.408
And?

29:18.452 --> 29:20.019
And we matched it to a member

29:20.062 --> 29:21.150
of your congregation.

29:21.194 --> 29:22.499
By spying on us.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.414
You're compelled to protect
your confessor.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.287
I would like to protect
our investigative techniques.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.638
Investigative techniques my foot.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.553
Those security cameras
around our perimeter...

29:32.596 --> 29:34.424
Are not owned by you.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.949
Right. But they're there because
we agreed to give

29:36.992 --> 29:39.865
the NYPD access
to prevent the church

29:39.908 --> 29:42.432
from being victimized
by terrorists.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.478
Not to be used against us.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.916
If we can put a murderer away
and free an innocent man,

29:47.960 --> 29:50.658
I'm okay with that.

29:52.486 --> 29:55.706
Don't throw my words
back at me, Frank.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.839
You betrayed me.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.799
Aw. Kevin...

30:11.026 --> 30:12.811
He asked me to work late,

30:12.854 --> 30:14.856
then ordered food and wine
up to the floor.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.640
As it got later, I realized

30:16.684 --> 30:18.642
I wasn't there
because of the case,

30:18.686 --> 30:20.949
and I got a little
uncomfortable.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.169
I told him I was leaving,

30:23.212 --> 30:26.476
and that's when he
blocked the door...

30:26.520 --> 30:29.131
pushed me up against the wall

30:29.175 --> 30:31.394
and attacked me.

30:32.526 --> 30:33.744
You didn't call 911?

30:33.788 --> 30:36.922
I thought about it,
but he's a lawyer.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.838
I'd seen him destroy
victims in court.

30:39.881 --> 30:44.712
And I was just a first year
trying to make my way up.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.366
I didn't want the
charge to go public.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.063
What if I got blacklisted?

30:48.107 --> 30:51.240
Did you go to the hospital
or tell anyone after?

30:51.284 --> 30:55.418
I told my roommate,
and I went to HR,

30:55.462 --> 30:58.160
just because I didn't want it
to happen to another woman.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.337
And what happened
when he found out

31:01.381 --> 31:02.948
about the HR complaint?

31:02.991 --> 31:07.256
He told me I didn't have a case.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.911
That I ordered the
liquor on my card,

31:09.955 --> 31:12.305
which was against firm policy.

31:12.348 --> 31:15.612
And that I asked for it,

31:15.656 --> 31:17.658
and no one would believe me.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.882
Would you be willing to file

31:23.925 --> 31:25.927
a criminal complaint
against him now?

31:25.971 --> 31:28.364
Why?

31:30.453 --> 31:32.673
He did it to someone else,
didn't he?

31:32.716 --> 31:35.632
I think you would regret it
if you did not come forward.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.069
Do you think there's a shot
at convicting him

31:37.112 --> 31:38.287
if I come forward?

31:38.331 --> 31:39.680
I do.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.205
He threatened me
after it happened.

31:43.249 --> 31:46.208
Said if I ever went
to the police, he'd destroy me.

31:46.252 --> 31:49.124
Well, how about we
destroy him first?

31:52.998 --> 31:55.522
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:56.697 --> 32:00.135
Anthony is taking
her statement now.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.354
Is it enough to press charges?

32:01.397 --> 32:02.921
It is. I'm gonna
charge Roland

32:02.964 --> 32:04.052
with two counts of rape,

32:04.096 --> 32:05.358
one for each victim.

32:05.401 --> 32:08.448
Oh, Erin, this is,
this is great.

32:08.491 --> 32:12.408
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
I was such a pain.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.803
Are you? Sorry?

32:15.846 --> 32:17.631
What?

32:17.674 --> 32:20.677
Do you really regret
fighting for that case?

32:20.721 --> 32:22.636
- Well, no.
- Okay.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.116
So why are you apologizing?

32:25.421 --> 32:26.683
As women, we are
always taught

32:26.727 --> 32:29.643
to apologize
for being assertive

32:29.686 --> 32:32.951
or demanding our voice.

32:32.994 --> 32:35.301
Don't. Don't do that.

32:36.345 --> 32:39.218
You're right.
I'm not sorry.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.742
I'm glad I had you take
a second look.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.005
Otherwise Roland might have
gotten away with it.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.572
So own it.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.139
I will.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.402
But if you ever
do that again,

32:49.445 --> 32:51.578
bring a victim into
my office unannounced,

32:51.621 --> 32:54.059
I'll make sure that you regret
the day you were born.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.365
Okay.

33:05.722 --> 33:08.638
What up, G?
What's up, baby?

33:08.682 --> 33:10.336
$32,000, like you asked.

33:10.379 --> 33:12.207
Where's the fentanyl?

33:12.251 --> 33:13.600
I don't have it
with me right now.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.471
What you mean you don't have
it with you right now?

33:15.515 --> 33:16.995
That's not the deal.

33:17.038 --> 33:20.041
I think he's been made.
I think we should move in.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.912
I think we should wait.
I agree.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.436
Let's see what happens.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.698
Give me the money.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.004
I'll drop off the drugs later.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.006
Hey, yo, my man,
that's not the deal.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.312
I want the fenty now,

33:30.356 --> 33:32.488
or you don't get
the money.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.663
How 'bout you give me
the money,

33:33.707 --> 33:34.969
or we kill your family.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.623
My family?

33:36.666 --> 33:39.321
What are you talking about?

33:39.365 --> 33:40.583
Go.

33:43.325 --> 33:46.328
Daddy! Daddy!

33:46.372 --> 33:48.504
- Let's go.
- ESU, go!

33:48.548 --> 33:49.940
Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:51.768 --> 33:53.901
Daddy!

33:54.989 --> 33:56.295
We got a man down!

34:00.560 --> 34:02.475
Gray Mercedes
fleeing the scene.

34:02.518 --> 34:05.695
Central Team One, we need a bus
to this location forthwith.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.175
Let's go. All units move in.
All units.

34:07.219 --> 34:10.048
Stay put. We have help
- on the way, okay?
- My family!

34:11.266 --> 34:12.746
My family.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.530
We're gonna do everything we
can to get your family back.

34:28.979 --> 34:30.546
- Is he gonna make it?
- Yeah, why?

34:30.590 --> 34:32.113
You plan on using his family
to get him to do something else

34:32.157 --> 34:33.375
to help out your case?

34:33.419 --> 34:35.769
It's not my fault
they took his family, Jamie.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.162
No, but if we'd moved in
quicker, maybe we could've

34:37.205 --> 34:38.946
stopped 'em from taking off
with his wife and kid.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.948
We had to wait for confirmation
that they had the drugs.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.558
That's the point, Joe,
we didn't need to wait.

34:42.602 --> 34:43.907
Okay.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.866
Hey, you know what
your problem is?

34:45.909 --> 34:47.650
- Right now it's you, man.
- You haven't learned yet

34:47.694 --> 34:48.869
that only thinking about collars

34:48.912 --> 34:50.392
and not thinking things through
is gonna

34:50.436 --> 34:51.567
get you or someone else killed.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.134
Great. Then I'll be
just like my dad, huh?

34:53.178 --> 34:56.224
Yo, we got a hit
from the GPS.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.097
- They're headed to Brooklyn.
- Let's go.

35:10.151 --> 35:11.674
- We're going in the front.
- I'll cover the side.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.112
Two in the back.
You go with him.

35:25.297 --> 35:28.300
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

35:34.958 --> 35:36.308
I see the wife and the daughter.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.399
Jamie, what are you doing?

35:40.442 --> 35:42.662
They're alone.

35:44.533 --> 35:45.534
We have to wait
for the signal.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.669
You're big on waiting.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.340
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

36:08.383 --> 36:09.341
Come on!

36:10.864 --> 36:12.518
Watch him get
past the defense.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.217
Come here.

36:16.261 --> 36:20.700
It's okay, he's a cop.
He's going to help us.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.268
- Come on.
- Go. Go.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.400
I'm gonna hold your hand and
we're gonna go outside, okay?

36:26.662 --> 36:28.403
Hey. I got her.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.580
Okay.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.976
Stay right here,
stay right here. Okay?

36:36.019 --> 36:38.587
Takes a shot that is blocked.

36:38.631 --> 36:39.893
Aw, man!

36:44.158 --> 36:46.291
Stay quiet, we're gonna
get you out of here.

36:46.334 --> 36:47.988
Okay.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.773
Quiet.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.210
Quiet, quiet...

36:53.428 --> 36:54.603
What's going on out there?

36:56.344 --> 36:58.738
Go, go, go!

37:00.740 --> 37:01.828
Stay, stay.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.441
Are you okay?
Yeah.

37:15.363 --> 37:18.061
You didn't kill Stephanie.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.759
What?

37:19.802 --> 37:21.891
It was the Peeping Tom
you told us about.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.806
He's the one that installed
the hidden camera

37:23.850 --> 37:26.069
inside the smoke detector.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.159
And then he eventually
worked up the nerve to attack.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.467
You sure?

37:32.511 --> 37:34.904
The hidden camera recorded
Stephanie's murder.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.255
We found the memory card
in his apartment.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.083
So, yeah, we're sure.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.609
I could have helped her.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.872
- Maybe.
- If I had been awake.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.917
Or if I hadn't had
too much to drink...

37:47.961 --> 37:49.832
Maybe you could have
helped her. Maybe.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.314
Or maybe you would have
gotten killed, too.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.883
I wish I did.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.146
Lamar, you can't
live like that.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.279
It's not gonna work.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.020
Trust me, I've been there.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.501
Stephanie loved you, right?

38:07.981 --> 38:10.549
Like no one else.

38:10.592 --> 38:13.508
So she wouldn't want you
to stop living your life.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.124
No.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.433
So maybe the best way
you could pay tribute

38:25.477 --> 38:28.436
is to just...

38:28.480 --> 38:30.133
carry on.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.529
Somehow find a way to be happy.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.888
Let's get this man home.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.654
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.440
It has been two months
since my last confession.

39:15.483 --> 39:18.268
And what are your sins?

39:18.312 --> 39:22.621
Well, a friend of mine
thinks I betrayed him.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.362
And did you?

39:25.928 --> 39:28.191
Well, I don't see it that way.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.933
The way I see it is
I betrayed him

39:30.977 --> 39:33.196
in order to help him.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.722
Which is still a betrayal.

39:36.765 --> 39:40.726
Well, see, that's
the hard part because

39:40.769 --> 39:43.903
I'm not really sorry
for what I did.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.995
I can't absolve you
if you're not sorry.

39:49.038 --> 39:52.694
I mean I'm not sorry
for what I did,

39:52.738 --> 39:56.263
but I am sorry
that I upset him.

39:58.265 --> 40:03.096
Sounds like your actions
hurt your friend deeply.

40:03.139 --> 40:07.361
But see, I treasure
our friendship,

40:07.405 --> 40:09.407
so...

40:09.450 --> 40:13.236
I'm not asking for absolution.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.718
I'm just hoping
that he will forgive me.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.681
Say six Hail Marys,

40:22.724 --> 40:25.858
and as an act of contrition,

40:25.901 --> 40:28.034
take your friend out to dinner.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.907
Steaks at Gallaghers?

40:31.951 --> 40:33.953
See you at 8:00.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.529
All right,

40:44.572 --> 40:46.835
anyone want to tell me
what's going on?

40:46.879 --> 40:48.533
We thought you knew.

40:48.576 --> 40:49.838
Don't look at me.

40:49.882 --> 40:52.885
Dad? What are
- we doing here?
- Ask Jamie.

40:52.928 --> 40:55.496
Chicago Texas Hold 'Em,
Reagan style.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.325
It's a good game,
if you like wild cards.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.066
Yeah. You should be able
to relate.

41:00.109 --> 41:02.242
It's basically Texas Hold 'Em.

41:02.285 --> 41:05.027
Hundred-dollar buy-in,
one to ante, but...

41:05.071 --> 41:06.942
nines and threes are wild.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.031
All right. Why this game
in particular?

41:09.075 --> 41:11.207
This was your dad's favorite.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.513
'Cause he won it all the time.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.515
Not all the time.
Some of us knew his tells.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.039
He would clear his throat
whenever he had a good hand.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.519
All you need to know
about this game is

41:18.563 --> 41:20.260
you've got to have patience.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.522
And a knack for the hot seat.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.089
Yeah.

41:23.132 --> 41:24.960
And you gotta be able
to handle pressure.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.180
Like everybody at this table.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.791
Like everybody in this family.

41:29.835 --> 41:30.966
Challenge accepted.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.751
Good. Two dollars to you.

41:36.276 --> 41:38.365
Make it 20.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.630
- Whoa.
- Fold.

41:42.674 --> 41:45.851
- I fold.
- I got <i>schmegegge.</i> I fold.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.114
Make it 40.

41:48.157 --> 41:49.637
Ooh.

41:54.642 --> 41:55.730
You've got a pair.

41:55.774 --> 41:57.950
So I've been told.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.431
You got a good poker face.

42:02.476 --> 42:03.782
So I've been told.

42:13.574 --> 42:15.489
Fold.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.449
All right,

42:19.493 --> 42:20.929
Dad, you deal next.

42:20.973 --> 42:22.191
Okay.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.369
But this time...

42:26.413 --> 42:28.284
let's up the ante.
