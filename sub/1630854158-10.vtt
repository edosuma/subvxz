It's the money

01:59.511 --> 02:01.269
You buy it

Milhouse,
what's really going on here?

04:31.513 --> 04:33.421

09:12.052 --> 09:14.368
when you run a business,
as we are,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.203
you need a product and a market

10:04.087 --> 10:05.678
Would you like to
put your feet up on my desk

10:05.755 --> 10:07.564
as we daydream about our goals?

10:12.261 --> 10:13.612
(helicopter blades whirring)

10:13.763 --> 10:15.505
(chuckles)

10:15.523 --> 10:17.449
(both sigh)

10:21.196 --> 10:24.347
And top salesperson of the day
goes to...

10:24.366 --> 10:27.125
Sherri, who unloaded
150 rainbow mohawks

10:27.276 --> 10:29.461
at ten Bobux a pop.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.278
(cheering)

10:31.373 --> 10:32.797
Couple more days like that,

10:33.024 --> 10:34.782
and you're getting
the trip to Honolulu.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.859
(gasps)

10:35.952 --> 10:36.801
This is new.

10:36.953 --> 10:39.212
An ice cream truck.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.956
Wait, they're shooting
ice cream at us.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.701
(grunting)

10:44.794 --> 10:47.128
BART:
It's an ice cream drive-by. Run!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.872
(Milhouse panting)

10:48.965 --> 10:51.733
Oh, no. It's a trap.

10:53.136 --> 10:56.029
(Bart yells)

10:56.214 --> 10:58.156
Not unicorns.

10:58.233 --> 11:01.326
They're my second-favorite
magical horse.

11:05.223 --> 11:07.314
JIMBO:
<i> "Boblox</i> belongs to us."

11:07.334 --> 11:11.060
People, looks like
we've got ourselves a turf war.

11:11.079 --> 11:13.296
(grunting)

11:19.087 --> 11:21.754
-Bad news,
we've got competition.
-Who?

11:21.907 --> 11:26.518
The Sunflower gang's IP address
belongs to some place called...

11:26.669 --> 11:28.928
Limitless Frontier Horizons.

11:29.097 --> 11:30.246
Hmm, what do you know?

11:30.265 --> 11:32.649
The Montessori School.

11:40.926 --> 11:42.775
Check out
the fancy groundskeepers.

11:42.928 --> 11:46.037
Those aren't groundskeepers.
They're parent volunteers.

11:46.264 --> 11:48.932
Pay for tuition,
then work for free.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.858
What a racket.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.769
(grumbles)

11:52.862 --> 11:54.771
Good morning,
Principal Skinner.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.622
Hello, "kids-call-you-Sandra."

11:56.699 --> 11:58.717
Um... (clears throat)
maybe you're not aware of this,

11:58.944 --> 12:01.052
but, uh, some of your students
have been interfering

12:01.221 --> 12:04.781
with some of my kids', um,
independent study project.

12:04.799 --> 12:08.560
Ooh, I'd love to help, but
our curriculum is student-led.

12:08.787 --> 12:11.471
So if their passion is the
monetization of coding errors,

12:11.565 --> 12:14.640
it's part of our core belief
system that I support them.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.403
That's, uh, progressive school
mumbo jumbo for "screw you."

12:18.630 --> 12:21.406
You can't tell me
you want war with us.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.968
Um, well, "can't"
is a word we don't use here.

12:24.986 --> 12:27.728
We also don't say "don't."
We just can't.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.563
Are you even in charge?

12:29.657 --> 12:31.565
No! I just send out emails

12:31.585 --> 12:34.068
trying to convince parents
there's a plan to all this.

12:34.162 --> 12:36.813
Oh, please come to
our silent auction next week.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.982
One of our dads is Drake.

12:39.075 --> 12:41.150
He'll emcee but not perform.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.486
(sighs) That'll be all, Sandra.

12:43.505 --> 12:46.631
Oh, that is a really nice tower,
Truth-Anne.

12:46.783 --> 12:48.600
Yeah, yeah, they're all nice.

12:48.827 --> 12:50.251
Let's take a walk.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.937
Let me show you
what I've built here.

12:53.164 --> 12:55.665
From day one, these curiosity
seekers have been told

12:55.683 --> 12:58.184
they can succeed at
anything they set their mind to.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.612
Do you think you can win
against that unbreakable,

13:00.781 --> 13:02.429
unearned self-confidence?

13:03.358 --> 13:06.284
Look, there's room in
the<i> Boblox</i> scam for both of us.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.103
You take the gumdrop fields
and teddy bear bouncy rooms.

13:09.197 --> 13:11.772
We keep the penguin fun land
and the mushroom castles.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.609
Well, sharing is one of
the habits of the heart.

13:15.703 --> 13:16.961
We accept.

13:17.113 --> 13:20.006
(chuckles) Can you excuse us
for a moment?

13:22.210 --> 13:24.210
What the hell are you doing?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.212
What? We had to make a deal.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.140
With only half the money,
there's no revolving stage,

13:29.292 --> 13:31.125
no flying wire harness system.

13:31.219 --> 13:33.127
Good luck doing
<i> Angels in America.</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:35.129
We can't go to war
with these psychos.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.040
Their self-esteem
is off the charts.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.299
Take the deal.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.393
(groans)

13:41.321 --> 13:45.139
So, fellow lifelong learners,
do we have an understanding?

13:45.233 --> 13:47.884
Yes, uh, we have
an understanding.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.552
Understand this:

13:49.571 --> 13:52.813
"When you come at the king,
you best not miss."

13:52.907 --> 13:55.482
(chuckles): You're going
to quote<i> The Wire</i> to me?

13:55.502 --> 13:59.337
My dad directed three episodes
in the dockyards season.

13:59.488 --> 14:02.248
That season was slow, and also:

14:02.417 --> 14:04.917
This. Is. War.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.219
(groans)

14:13.502 --> 14:15.745
Look, we can still get
a deal with these guys.

14:15.763 --> 14:17.355
-Let's just go
back in there and...
-You're out.

14:17.582 --> 14:18.915
-What?
-You don't have the stones

14:18.933 --> 14:20.692
for the mohawk trade.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.360
You can't fire me.

14:22.511 --> 14:24.863
You're right, people
who are fired get a severance.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.772
You get nothing.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.108
This is my grift.
I brought you in.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.851
It's all in the game, son.

14:30.871 --> 14:34.447
All in the video game game.

14:34.599 --> 14:37.100
Those self-esteem punks
are gunning for us.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.118
I need a ruthless,
bloodthirsty general.

14:39.287 --> 14:42.714
-Milhouse, you're up.
-(spits, coughs)

14:42.790 --> 14:45.625
Me? But what about Bart?

14:45.777 --> 14:47.218
(scoffs) He's history,

14:47.370 --> 14:49.053
and this school
doesn't teach history.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.614
Do it and you'll never
have to play dodgeball again.

14:51.633 --> 14:55.042
And I get the pretty teacher
for fifth grade.

14:55.136 --> 14:58.897
-Mrs. McCarthy?
-You know who I'm talking about.

14:59.124 --> 15:01.357
Mm. Ms. Tanaka.

15:03.052 --> 15:05.128
Let's hit these sunflowers
where it hurts.

15:05.146 --> 15:08.481
They steal our princess tiaras,
we kill their unicorns.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.133
They strangle our gnomes,

15:10.151 --> 15:11.743
we glitter-bomb
their pumpkin patch.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.745
So get out there
and paint the streets

15:13.896 --> 15:15.988
with the blood
of tomorrow's leaders.

15:16.141 --> 15:18.249
<i> ASTRID AND FRENCH FRY:</i>
<i> Let's talk</i> Boblox!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.585
Hey, everybody!
It's me, Astrid.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.587
And it's me, French Fry!

15:22.814 --> 15:24.480
-Hi, Astrid.
-Hi, French Fry.

15:24.499 --> 15:26.907
Have you been seeing
all this craziness in<i> Boblox?</i>

15:27.001 --> 15:28.501
It's so crazy.

15:28.653 --> 15:30.111
The Springfield kids
were selling mohawks,

15:30.171 --> 15:32.004
but so were
the Montessori Sunflower kids,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.656
so they got in a gang war.

15:33.675 --> 15:36.509
Everyone is being so grouchy,
makes me sad.

15:36.661 --> 15:38.919
Check out what happened
to the Springfield kids

15:39.013 --> 15:40.179
at the Candyland.

15:41.182 --> 15:43.424
I like bears,
but this one looks mean.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.184
(growling)

15:45.336 --> 15:47.336
-Aah!
-Ew. He was mean.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.338
You are always right
about bears.

15:49.507 --> 15:51.340
Don't ever rip me in half,
French Fry.

15:51.434 --> 15:53.934
(gasps) I would never, Astrid.

15:54.028 --> 15:55.845
<i> BOTH: Online friends forever!</i>

15:55.863 --> 15:58.514
Oh, look, it's a fashion show.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.349
I love fashion shows.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.943
This Nelson guy looks
so cute in a vest.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.253
Cutie alert!

16:06.040 --> 16:09.300
Ouch. That Sunflower kid
is stabbing him.

16:09.527 --> 16:10.543
Stabbing's for jerks.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.378
The Springfield gang
is getting wiped out.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.531
Astrid, why are candy canes
only for Christmas?

16:15.624 --> 16:16.882
Great question.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.718
Subscribers, post your theories.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.627
No racist stuff, you guys.

16:20.722 --> 16:22.438
BOTH: Bye!

16:24.392 --> 16:27.735
HOMER: We did it.
We made our house in<i> Boblox.</i>

16:28.804 --> 16:31.823
Aw, I wish Lisa were here, too.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.974
Guys, you've been
in this game so long

16:33.994 --> 16:35.309
that, out in the real world,

16:35.403 --> 16:37.720
the lawn is overgrown,
Bart bought a Lexus,

16:37.813 --> 16:40.890
and I had to go to my own
parent-teacher conference.

16:40.908 --> 16:44.651
Turns out I'm a joy to have in
class and I might need glasses.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.580
Guess what, honey.
Maggie talks in here.

16:48.733 --> 16:52.826
Whoa, Maggie, you're
communicating using only emojis,

16:52.846 --> 16:55.179
like an old person trying
to act like a teenager.

16:55.331 --> 16:58.591
Ha! And, Dad,
you're not at Moe's?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.243
Why would I be at Moe's

17:00.245 --> 17:02.186
when we can play volleyball
with my head?

17:02.413 --> 17:03.312
(grunts)

17:04.098 --> 17:06.357
-Whee!
-(laughter)

17:06.526 --> 17:09.676
Who would have thought that
our family would be happiest

17:09.696 --> 17:11.437
inside a video game?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.181
HOMER:
It's heaven, and it's all
from the comfort

17:14.275 --> 17:17.285

17:42.787 --> 17:44.729
They've taken it all.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.142
Hmm. I'm gonna show these kids

something

18:19.415 --> 18:22.174
He's destroyed
the community wasabi garden.

18:22.251 --> 18:24.160
He's heading
for the computer lab.

18:24.178 --> 18:26.479
What kind of nurturing is this?

18:28.775 --> 18:29.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.184
Out of my way.

18:32.337 --> 18:33.945
Don't do this, Seymour.

18:34.172 --> 18:35.521
Oh, I'm doing it.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.674
If I crush their computer lab,
we beat these psychos.

18:38.693 --> 18:41.768
Look at yourself. You're
about to bulldoze a school.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.455
They took Daddy's money...

18:44.682 --> 18:46.682
(engine revving)

18:46.684 --> 18:48.275
...and I'm the daddy!

18:48.294 --> 18:51.612
What's happening? We're in
unchartered school territory.

18:51.706 --> 18:53.356
(clucks)

18:53.374 --> 18:55.358
I've spent
the best years of your life

18:55.376 --> 18:57.135
trying to drive you insane,

18:57.286 --> 18:59.044
and now I don't want that.

18:59.197 --> 19:01.139
This isn't you.
You're not a psycho.

19:01.215 --> 19:04.200
You're lame,
like unfrosted cornflakes.

19:04.293 --> 19:06.293
But I want to be Lucky Charms.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.463
It's okay. Corn Flakes
is a surprisingly good cereal.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.983
But crushing
this kombucha academy,

19:12.210 --> 19:14.043
that'll ruin your life.

19:14.136 --> 19:16.470
And being partners with you
has made me realize

19:16.564 --> 19:18.805
you're... a human being.

19:18.883 --> 19:20.049
No, I'm not.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.476
You are. Walk away.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.163
But I already rented
the costumes for<i> Seussical.</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:27.832
It was never meant to be.

19:28.059 --> 19:30.001
But... Josh Gad.

19:30.228 --> 19:31.669
Josh Gad is not real.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.320
He never was.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.465
(sighs)
Right, of course he's not.

19:38.069 --> 19:41.253
(backup alarm beeping)

19:41.406 --> 19:43.514
Maybe there's
a teachable moment here.

19:43.741 --> 19:47.593
In a sense, the bulldozer
is Anglo-Saxon privilege.

19:47.762 --> 19:49.094
You're fired, Sandra.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.171
Oh, thank you!

19:51.265 --> 19:53.524
Come on, let's head

19:53.676 --> 19:55.026
I'll buy you a shake

19:55.177 --> 19:57.010

your other stupid dreams

19:57.104 --> 19:58.362

19:58.514 --> 20:01.365
No, Bart, I'm done

20:01.592 --> 20:05.185
<i> because a fantasy world</i>
<i> is no place to live.</i>

20:05.354 --> 20:07.020

20:07.189 --> 20:09.707
the newspapers have been
stacking up on your porch.

20:09.858 --> 20:12.585
I just thought I'd peek in
