01:58.301 --> 02:00.349
Otto!

02:00.345 --> 02:02.018
Open inspection.

03:36.858 --> 03:38.781
I don't think so.

03:38.777 --> 03:40.745
It doesn't feel right, somehow.

03:58.046 --> 04:00.549
Only people who like garlic
as neighbours.

04:00.549 --> 04:02.847
They're the best neighbours to have.

04:02.843 --> 04:06.473
We're here. The train station's there.

04:06.471 --> 04:09.350
No more than five minutes' walk.

04:09.349 --> 04:13.320
The bus routes are there and there.
About six or seven, I think.

04:13.311 --> 04:15.609
Let's walk it and see.

04:15.605 --> 04:17.482
- Hiya.
- Hi.

04:17.482 --> 04:19.325
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.681
There - that's 6.5 minutes again.

04:49.639 --> 04:51.516
Fingers crossed.

05:23.506 --> 05:25.725
King! Wakey wakey!

05:25.717 --> 05:27.594
This'll wake him.

05:31.222 --> 05:33.065
J' Wassup, muthafucka? J'

05:33.058 --> 05:34.776
Wassup, motherfucker!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.146
J' Don't fuck with me,
you pussy-assed muthafucka

05:37.145 --> 05:40.069
J' 'Cause ah'm tha one
I'm not fuckin' with

05:40.065 --> 05:42.193
J' When I a baby boy, I killed my twin

05:42.192 --> 05:43.910
J' Brother grim, suffocated him... J'

05:43.902 --> 05:45.745
King!

05:45.737 --> 05:49.583
J' ..they held me, repelled me,
expelled me to the penitentiary

05:49.574 --> 05:52.327
J' Yessiree, none could fuck with me,
and in society I rule

05:52.327 --> 05:55.547
J' Ah'm the dominator, terminator,
re-indicator of direction

05:55.538 --> 05:57.290
J' Ah'm born to die to make you cry... J'

05:57.290 --> 05:59.543
- King home?
- Yeah, course he is.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.169
King!

06:01.169 --> 06:04.173
J' I'm the scariest
fuckin' nigga ever stood

06:04.172 --> 06:06.800
J' Ah'm the one, ah'm the one,
ah'm the one

06:06.800 --> 06:09.644
J' Ah'm a crazy muthafucka,
fuckin' awesome muthafucka

06:09.636 --> 06:11.183
J' Ah'm a scary fuckin' nigga

06:11.179 --> 06:12.726
J' Finger on the fuckin' trigger

06:12.722 --> 06:15.225
J' Ah'm a finger-fucking frigger
In my bitch!

06:15.225 --> 06:16.852
J' Now, I rule these fuckin' streets

06:16.851 --> 06:18.979
J' And the cops on their beats,
I don't give a fuck

06:18.979 --> 06:20.981
J' Fuck the police,
they don't fuck with me no more

06:20.981 --> 06:23.530
J' 'Cause they fuckin' know if they cheat
they're dead meat in the street

06:23.525 --> 06:26.620
J' In two seconds less than it takes for
me to piss on their bullet-ridden body

06:26.611 --> 06:29.615
J' Ah'm a cop killer, shoplifter,
e seller, bank teller

06:29.614 --> 06:31.582
J' Ah'm out to smash, to kill and crash

06:31.574 --> 06:33.292
J' And turn the fuckin' cops to trash

06:33.284 --> 06:35.537
J' Ah'm fuckin' public enemy
fuckin' number one

06:35.537 --> 06:38.165
J' Ah'm more dangerous
than Attila the fuckin' Hun!

06:38.164 --> 06:41.043
J' Ah'm the one! Ah'm the one!
Ah'm the one!

06:41.042 --> 06:43.966
J' Ah'm a crazy muthafucka
fuckin' awesome muthafucka

06:43.962 --> 06:46.841
J' Ah'm a scary fuckin' nigga,
finger on the fuckin' trigger

06:46.840 --> 06:49.468
J' Ah'm a finger-fuckin' frigger
in my bitch!

06:49.467 --> 06:52.186
J' Bitches and ladies,
you don't know shit

06:52.178 --> 06:53.725
J' Let me tell you right... J'

07:04.899 --> 07:07.322
So you bought the place, hey?

07:07.318 --> 07:08.865
Yeah.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.956
Otto.

07:10.947 --> 07:13.166
I'm a chef.

07:13.158 --> 07:15.911
My wife's Maria.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.959
In the corporate world.
Executive assistant.

07:18.955 --> 07:23.506
Max, science teacher.
Therese, tax accountant.

07:23.501 --> 07:26.050
Looks like the men do all the cooking.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.716
You know - bubble, bubble.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.844
I see.

07:31.843 --> 07:33.686
Hello!

07:33.678 --> 07:36.557
Maria, this is Max.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.275
They're the ones. They bought the place.

07:41.269 --> 07:44.864
You are the only ones
who ever said 'hi'.

07:44.856 --> 07:48.201
You wouldn't believe it, but everyone
else always ignored us.

07:48.193 --> 07:50.821
We were hoping you'd be the ones.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.501
Just met the neighbours on this side.
They seem really nice.

08:00.497 --> 08:02.215
Otto and Maria.

08:02.207 --> 08:04.426
Otto's Mr Have A Chat.

08:28.233 --> 08:30.361
A good balance then!

08:30.360 --> 08:33.034
What?

08:33.029 --> 08:37.284
Nice on one side
and very interesting on the other.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.720
Careful you don't cut yourself
on the fence there.

08:53.716 --> 08:56.890
I'm sitting on my slippery dip.

08:57.929 --> 09:00.227
Hmm.

09:03.893 --> 09:05.816
I'm Therese, your new neighbour.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.439
I know that.

09:11.401 --> 09:13.449
And you are?

09:13.444 --> 09:17.449
Mirabelle. But you don't
have to call me that.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.415
- No?
- No.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.844
And what should I call you?

09:36.217 --> 09:38.345
Maybe we should start
on the lower branches,

09:38.344 --> 09:40.267
open it up underneath.

09:40.263 --> 09:41.856
For some native grasses, maybe.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.725
- Yeah.
- OK.

09:43.725 --> 09:45.898
I'll do the acacias,
you do the casuarinas

09:45.894 --> 09:47.896
and we should
do the grevilleas together.

09:47.896 --> 09:49.523
- Sounds like a plan.
- Mmm.

10:19.135 --> 10:21.513
I think I've just seen
a drug deal go down.

10:24.474 --> 10:26.568
What?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.187
J' Ah'm the one, ah'm the one,
ah'm the one

10:29.187 --> 10:32.111
J' Ah'm a crazy muthafucka,
fuckin' awesome muthafucka

10:32.106 --> 10:34.985
J' Ah'm a scary fuckin' nigga,
finger on the fuckin' trigger

10:34.984 --> 10:37.783
J' Ah'm a finger-fuckin' frigger
in my bitch... J'

10:37.779 --> 10:40.248
Don't worry. That's not the worst of it.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.244
I've had to call the cops
a number of times.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.416
You wouldn't believe
the racket some nights.

10:46.788 --> 10:49.086
Mmm, I sort of feel safer this way.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.006
You know - if we maintain
good relations with them,

10:52.001 --> 10:53.844
they'll keep an eye out on the place.

10:53.836 --> 10:56.589
Know they're on to a good thing
with us as neighbours.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.843
Yeah.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.814
You want a cup of tea?

11:08.810 --> 11:11.063
Yes, please.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.198
It sounds like
someone's getting murdered.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.824
Mmm.

11:22.824 --> 11:24.792
Maybe we should call the cops.

11:24.784 --> 11:29.164
No, amphetamines. They're out of
control, but it sounds worse than it is.

11:30.999 --> 11:33.422
The ice sends them...

11:36.087 --> 11:38.181
How do you know so much about it?

11:49.017 --> 11:51.145
A broken window.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.317
Mmm. Two broken windows.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.532
A big night.

11:57.025 --> 11:59.369
Don't you work?

11:59.360 --> 12:02.079
No, no, no. We have jobs.

12:02.071 --> 12:03.618
We're just on holidays.

12:03.614 --> 12:05.241
Can I come over then?

12:05.241 --> 12:07.960
Maybe you should
ask your mum or your dad.

12:07.952 --> 12:10.080
I already did.

12:12.457 --> 12:14.801
You'll have to lift me over.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.840
Are you sure you're allowed?

12:16.836 --> 12:20.716
She did ask, but
only if it's OK with you.

12:20.715 --> 12:22.388
- Yeah!
- Of course it is.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.471
Come on, monkey.

12:31.893 --> 12:35.067
Thanks. But send her back
as soon as you're sick of her.

12:35.063 --> 12:36.815
She'll be fine.

12:45.990 --> 12:48.368
Psst! Psst!

12:48.368 --> 12:49.961
Psst! Hey!

12:59.754 --> 13:02.724
I'm King. I'm your neighbour.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.968
Hi, I'm Max. This is Therese.

13:04.967 --> 13:07.516
Yeah, doin' the garden nice, hey?

13:09.597 --> 13:13.067
Yeah, we're trying. Probably
do some planting next weekend.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.359
Put some more natives in.
And once they're established...

13:16.354 --> 13:19.733
- ..no watering.
- Look, gotta go. Nice talking to ya.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.250
I still can't believe it.
He just ignored me.

13:33.246 --> 13:37.342
Well, he was talking to the patriarch.
Women don't rate in his paradigm.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.506
Max, it's as if I wasn't even there.

13:40.795 --> 13:42.342
Look!

13:46.759 --> 13:48.306
Another drug deal.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.267
How would you know?

13:53.182 --> 13:56.026
I'm a tax accountant.
I know the criminal mind.

13:57.186 --> 14:00.190
More like you have one.

14:00.189 --> 14:02.942
It's bad enough for us.
It must be impossible for you.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.489
Oh, no. No worries.

14:04.485 --> 14:06.158
We're pretty tolerant.

14:06.154 --> 14:09.533
Yep, best neighbours on one side,
most interesting on the other.

14:10.658 --> 14:13.377
- Tell him.
- What?

14:13.369 --> 14:18.296
Well, Mirabelle and I were
talking about the possibility

14:18.291 --> 14:20.919
of a magic door in the fence.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.468
- Can we, Mum?
- Yep.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.466
The matriarch paradigm.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.895
J' I'm the scariest
fuckin' nigga ever stood... J'

14:33.890 --> 14:36.689
It would help
if he played a different song.

14:36.684 --> 14:39.528
He's been trying to learn the words.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.113
J' Ah'm a scam fuckin' nigga... J'

14:41.105 --> 14:42.982
Really?

14:42.982 --> 14:45.986
That's actually quite nice,
then.

14:48.279 --> 14:51.874
Yeah. He's got a creative streak.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.403
Thank God for that.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.533
Just means that
somebody called the cops.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.160
That's all.

15:54.303 --> 15:57.056
Seven, eight...
And it's just lying there.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.730
Don't show Otto. He'll be up for it.

15:59.725 --> 16:03.195
Could be the police arrived
and they ditched it over the fence.

16:03.187 --> 16:05.281
Yeah, Otto called them again last night.

16:05.273 --> 16:08.402
I'll take that.
I'll put it in the compost bin.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.074
Oh!

16:11.279 --> 16:12.952
Oh, hello.

16:12.947 --> 16:15.541
When are we gonna make the magic door?

16:31.632 --> 16:34.977
Let them in? You let them
two fuckin' cops into your house?

16:34.969 --> 16:38.018
Should've said, 'Where's
your fuckin' warrant, you cunts?'

16:38.014 --> 16:40.437
Should've fuckin' shot 'em dead!
Boom! Dead!

16:42.101 --> 16:44.524
I would've grabbed him
by the fuckin' hair!

16:44.520 --> 16:47.069
I don't care if one of them was bald.

16:47.064 --> 16:49.567
I would've grabbed him
by his fuckin' skull then!

16:49.567 --> 16:52.366
Then I would've let 'em have it!
Fuck them right up the arse!

16:52.361 --> 16:54.489
Right up the fuckin' arse!

16:56.157 --> 16:59.331
- Then I would've fuckin' shot the cunt!
- You're full of shit.

16:59.327 --> 17:01.295
Fuckin' give it to you up the arse!

17:01.287 --> 17:04.006
- I'm sure you'd love to, hey, buddy?
- Actually, I would.

17:09.837 --> 17:12.761
I reckon he's been in jail.

17:12.757 --> 17:14.509
Who?

17:14.508 --> 17:17.227
The big bloke who's around all the time.

17:17.219 --> 17:20.098
- Shrek.
- What?

17:20.097 --> 17:24.068
Well, in my mind, I call him 'Shrek'.

17:24.060 --> 17:28.361
He reminds me of a Shrek.
In physical appearance only.

17:28.356 --> 17:31.781
What about the other one?
The mean-looking one.

17:32.985 --> 17:37.331
He seems to think he's some big,
South American drug boss,

17:37.323 --> 17:39.121
on his mobile all the time.

17:41.202 --> 17:43.705
- 'Escobar', then.
- Who?

17:43.704 --> 17:46.332
I thought you might know
a little bit about that.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.879
What?!

17:47.875 --> 17:51.049
Escobar, South American drug lord.

17:51.045 --> 17:52.968
You sound like Trivial Pursuit.

17:52.963 --> 17:54.636
Well, I'm a teacher.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.260
I'm meant to know these things.

18:28.582 --> 18:32.257
Get out! Get out!

18:32.253 --> 18:35.507
Get out of the fucking car,
you fuckin' piece of shit!

18:35.506 --> 18:38.430
Get the fuck out! You son of a bitch,
get the fuck out!

18:38.426 --> 18:40.099
-  What's going on?

18:40.094 --> 18:43.519
Fuck off! Piss off, you cunt,
or I'll fuckin' smash ya! Fuck off!

18:43.514 --> 18:45.357
Off!

18:45.349 --> 18:47.147
Now, listen, get me my fuckin' money.

18:47.143 --> 18:49.612
In fuckin' half an hour,
you get me my fuckin' money

18:49.603 --> 18:51.856
and get back here in
half an hour or I'll kill ya!

18:51.856 --> 18:56.236
Get the fuck in the car and fuck off
outta my sight, you fucking fat cunt!

19:01.282 --> 19:04.502
Whoo! Whoo!

19:06.078 --> 19:09.173
I don't want to go down
that path, Therese.

19:09.165 --> 19:12.214
I just think it's gonna make things
a whole lot worse.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.547
If you don't, I will.

19:25.681 --> 19:27.308
OK.

19:27.308 --> 19:30.938
At least then I can say
I've never called the cops on them.

19:48.412 --> 19:50.460
Well, that shut them up.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.800
Mm-hm.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.590
That shut the fuckers up!

20:09.934 --> 20:11.777
No, not the hammer, thanks.

20:11.769 --> 20:14.147
Could you pass me the tin snips, please?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.614
Those ones there.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.743
Over there with the blue handles.

20:20.027 --> 20:21.574
They're the ones.

20:21.570 --> 20:23.368
These are the tin snips.

20:23.364 --> 20:26.538
And here we go - magic door!

21:06.198 --> 21:10.544
I'm just gonna put this... in here.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.334
Like that.

21:12.329 --> 21:15.173
Now, what's the first rule
of the magic door?

21:15.165 --> 21:18.715
Always ask you or Therese.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.930
Very good. And the second rule?

21:20.921 --> 21:26.303
If you say yes, always ask
Mummy or Daddy.

21:26.302 --> 21:27.849
Very good.

21:27.845 --> 21:30.564
Max, have you seen what King is doing?

21:30.556 --> 21:32.183
No.

21:32.182 --> 21:35.311
He's hacking down every bit
of vegetation in his front yard.

21:35.311 --> 21:38.736
Oh. I guess he's entitled to.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.529
He's just an idiot.

21:40.524 --> 21:42.993
' Hmm!

21:42.985 --> 21:44.737
Nice door.

21:47.197 --> 21:49.291
We're talking about the rules.

21:49.283 --> 21:52.787
Ah, yes, the most important three rules.

21:54.038 --> 21:56.382
And he managed to get as much...

21:57.917 --> 22:00.966
J' GENTLE SWING

22:18.187 --> 22:20.064
Evening.

22:20.064 --> 22:22.192
Could we borrow your bottle opener?

22:22.191 --> 22:25.536
We can't get it open.

22:26.904 --> 22:28.451
Need a bottle opener.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.415
Corkscrew.

22:33.535 --> 22:35.629
Hang on.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.964
It's King and Escobar.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.587
They want a corkscrew.

22:51.095 --> 22:53.689
Is that the old one?

22:53.681 --> 22:55.354
- Yeah.
- Just give it to them.

23:00.688 --> 23:02.315
Keep it.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.282
It's a spare.

23:23.585 --> 23:26.680
I don't trust that Escobar.

23:35.180 --> 23:38.024
I don't want him to have
an excuse to come back.

24:34.865 --> 24:37.038
Fuck. We've been done over.

25:00.432 --> 25:03.356
If you find anything else missing,
just call it through.

25:03.352 --> 25:05.320
I shouldn't think so.

25:05.312 --> 25:08.282
Whatever disturbed them
did so at just the right time.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.241
A bowl of coins.

25:10.234 --> 25:13.158
I've seen people lose every stick
of furniture in the house.

25:13.153 --> 25:16.373
I doubt he'll find anything.

25:16.365 --> 25:20.666
If anything turns up, we'll let you
know, but don't expect anything.

25:20.661 --> 25:23.460
OK, thank you.
- Thanks.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.426
They can't do anything.

25:28.418 --> 25:30.546
They say 85% of burglaries
are never solved.

25:30.546 --> 25:32.093
- Do they?
- Yeah.

25:32.089 --> 25:34.387
- I thought it was 95%.
- They left us this.

25:34.383 --> 25:36.511
Apparently, we're victims of crime.

25:36.510 --> 25:40.014
- We're to have no expectations.
- You're lucky nothing really went.

25:40.013 --> 25:41.765
They get much?

25:41.765 --> 25:44.393
No, just some loose change, that's all.

25:44.393 --> 25:46.236
That's 'cause I stopped them.

25:46.228 --> 25:49.152
Yep, darkies in your house, mate!

25:49.148 --> 25:51.901
Aborigines, taking your shit,
goin' out the front door.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.028
I said, 'Fuck 'em. I'll call the cops.'

25:56.905 --> 26:00.785
OK, no need to thank me, but it's
just the neighbourly thing to do, huh?

26:00.784 --> 26:03.583
Thanks.

26:03.579 --> 26:06.253
Hello. Have a good day.

26:09.543 --> 26:11.386
Shrek's full of shit.

26:11.378 --> 26:14.348
That front door was deadlocked.
It hadn't been opened.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.592
You mean, you think... he...?

26:16.592 --> 26:18.435
No.

26:18.427 --> 26:21.556
Even they wouldn't be that stupid.

26:21.555 --> 26:25.276
I should've seen this
as structurally the weak spot.

26:25.267 --> 26:28.862
Pretty handy, aren't you?

26:28.854 --> 26:32.233
Let's see them get through this.
Bastards.

26:32.232 --> 26:34.906
Idiots.

26:34.902 --> 26:37.405
You locked up yet?

26:37.404 --> 26:39.577
Just doing it now.

26:39.573 --> 26:42.372
I don't like living like this.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.244
- What?
- What? Nothing.

26:44.244 --> 26:45.917
I'm just talking to myself.

26:45.913 --> 26:49.759
I like to sleep with the windows open.

26:49.750 --> 26:53.380
- What?
- Nothing. Just talking to myself.

26:53.378 --> 26:56.222
Speak up. I can't hear you.

27:15.192 --> 27:17.115
What?

27:17.110 --> 27:18.862
Bastards.

27:26.119 --> 27:28.918
Bastards.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.461
Who? Who bastards?

27:30.457 --> 27:32.209
Bastards.

27:32.209 --> 27:34.337
They bastards.

27:36.755 --> 27:40.476
In my country,
we kill bastard like that.

27:42.135 --> 27:46.231
I live around the corner.
They're... they're bastards.

27:47.808 --> 27:50.607
How can you live
next door to the bastards?

27:52.813 --> 27:54.656
- It's not easy.
- Petrol bomb.

27:57.985 --> 27:59.532
The cops no good here.

27:59.528 --> 28:04.329
In my country, the cop
no good - petrol bomb.

28:04.324 --> 28:05.871
What is your country?

28:05.867 --> 28:07.790
Sicily.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.130
- Oh, in Italy?
- Sicily!

28:10.122 --> 28:15.344
OK, OK. Um... I better get going.

28:15.335 --> 28:16.962
You have a nice day.

28:20.382 --> 28:22.384
It's my gun.

28:23.427 --> 28:27.307
I lend you my good gun
for shoot the bastards.

28:28.974 --> 28:32.148
Thanks. I'll think about that.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.863
- I'll see you.
- Bastards.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.447
Shoot the bastards.

28:48.035 --> 28:50.208
And our other
neighbours were saying

28:50.203 --> 28:53.047
that we ought to put
a contract out on King.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.213
Oh, this is all getting out of control.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.633
Yeah, I prefer the petrol bomb idea
myself.

28:58.628 --> 29:00.972
No, no, no. I don't think
that's what she meant.

29:00.964 --> 29:03.342
Surely we should just talk to him first.

29:03.342 --> 29:07.267
Everybody? Like some kind
of UN delegation?

29:07.262 --> 29:09.981
No, I sort of meant you.

29:11.475 --> 29:14.979
He seems to regard you
as some sort of friend.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.740
Oh.

29:45.801 --> 29:49.931
Hey, King. I thought we might
sit out here and have a beer.

29:52.265 --> 29:54.643
Oh, you that Mack from next door?

29:55.894 --> 29:58.113
I'm that Max from next door.

29:59.648 --> 30:01.400
Yeah, I know how you feel.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.574
They give me the shits too.

30:06.113 --> 30:09.083
But I'm doing my best
to clean up the place.

30:09.074 --> 30:12.374
You know, doin' the garden nice.

30:12.369 --> 30:14.417
You know what I mean?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.470
I asked them to leave. They just won't.

30:21.461 --> 30:23.759
It's those young girls.

30:23.755 --> 30:27.100
They come around every night,
makin' a racket.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.186
Won't leave when I ask them.

30:31.138 --> 30:33.391
You gotta tell them, King.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.017
You can't ask them.

30:35.016 --> 30:38.646
Whose place is it, anyway?
Yours or theirs?

30:38.645 --> 30:41.194
It's my sister's place.

30:41.189 --> 30:42.816
She lets me stay here.

30:44.484 --> 30:46.782
She had this accident, see?

30:46.778 --> 30:48.701
She lives in the hospital now.

30:48.697 --> 30:50.620
In a coma.

30:51.658 --> 30:54.002
But she lets me stay here.

30:53.994 --> 30:57.749
I can't do anything
'cause it's not my place.

30:57.747 --> 31:01.047
And she can't do anything either.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.090
I just can't do anything.

31:06.715 --> 31:10.686
Listen to me, King. This is serious.

31:10.677 --> 31:13.931
I'm telling you this as a favour.

31:14.973 --> 31:18.318
To let you know how upset,
how upset all the neighbours are.

31:18.310 --> 31:22.736
To make you realize
that things can't go on like this.

31:23.982 --> 31:29.034
I've had three different people
talk of taking out a contract on you.

31:29.029 --> 31:31.031
Really.

31:31.031 --> 31:33.830
I've had one bloke
offering to lend me his gun to kill you.

31:33.825 --> 31:38.706
Although you know, I... I...
I'd never do that.

31:38.705 --> 31:43.552
I've had four people talk
about petrol bombing this place

31:43.543 --> 31:45.261
just to stop the noise.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.965
They gonna petrol-bomb my place?!

31:47.964 --> 31:49.887
I didn't say they'd do it.
I just said...

31:49.883 --> 31:52.511
Do they know
who they're fuckin' dealing with?

31:52.511 --> 31:55.685
I'll burn down... No, no.
I'll get my mates around here.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.729
They're bikies, you know.
A bikie gang's my mates!

31:58.725 --> 32:00.398
- Yeah!
- Just calm down, King.

32:00.393 --> 32:04.068
We'll burn every house around here.
Yeah, that's what we'll do!

32:04.064 --> 32:06.362
We'll burn every house
till there's none left!

32:06.358 --> 32:08.031
Calm down!

32:08.026 --> 32:09.903
Jesus!

32:09.903 --> 32:13.783
No... No-one is gonna be doing this,
King.

32:13.782 --> 32:16.126
I was just telling you how people felt.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.846
Well, they'd better
not fuckin' try, I'm telling you.

32:39.933 --> 32:42.027
He's hopeless.

32:45.522 --> 32:47.524
Hopeless.

33:11.089 --> 33:14.093
- That's it.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.810
I'm calling the police.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.770
No, no, she's screaming.
Can you hear this?

33:20.765 --> 33:22.859
-  Did you hear that?

33:22.851 --> 33:25.604
No, it doesn't sound
like simple domestic violence.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.107
What's so simple
about domestic violence, anyway?

33:28.106 --> 33:31.827
Is there a court order?
How in the hell should I know?

33:31.818 --> 33:33.866
This is happening next door, right now!

33:33.862 --> 33:35.785
This is happening right now!

34:10.065 --> 34:12.193
- G'day.
- Hey.

34:12.192 --> 34:13.944
- You the one who called?
- Yep.

34:13.943 --> 34:17.117
Seems to be a young fella and his girl
involved. They've scarpered.

34:17.112 --> 34:18.659
Nothing we can currently do.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.331
I feel sorry for you people
living next door to this lot.

34:22.744 --> 34:24.996
Isn't there anything that can be done?

34:24.996 --> 34:27.748
Go see a lawyer. Sue them
for disturbing your peace.

34:27.748 --> 34:31.128
Go and see a politician. Get the law
changed so we can do something.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.676
Anyway, good luck.

34:34.714 --> 34:36.591
Thank you.

34:39.386 --> 34:42.264
The cops feel sorry for us.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.824
Right, that's it.

35:00.281 --> 35:03.876
- King! King!

35:03.868 --> 35:05.620
King!

35:07.497 --> 35:10.751
If this screaming does not stop
in 30 seconds,

35:10.750 --> 35:12.593
I'm calling the cops again!

35:13.628 --> 35:16.347
Oh, mate, don't call the cops.

35:16.339 --> 35:20.344
- She's fuckin' crazy, you know?

35:20.343 --> 35:22.311
He's a friend of mine.

35:22.303 --> 35:26.479
Listen to me, King.
I'm patient and tolerant.

35:26.474 --> 35:30.104
And you know I would not normally call
the cops, no matter what you do.

35:30.103 --> 35:33.698
But if I hear a woman,
in distress, in your house,

35:33.690 --> 35:35.237
I'm calling the cops!

35:35.233 --> 35:37.986
Fuckin' mind your own fuckin' business!

35:37.986 --> 35:41.286
Now, fuck off or I'll burn
your fuckin' house down!

35:50.039 --> 35:51.962
He's not your friend, King.

35:51.958 --> 35:54.586
He's sucking you dry.

35:56.546 --> 35:58.389
Now, I'm calling the cops again.

35:58.381 --> 36:00.475
In 30 seconds.

36:00.467 --> 36:02.890
Oh, no... Don't.

36:04.679 --> 36:06.681
Civil rights.

36:08.308 --> 36:10.231
Ah.

36:10.226 --> 36:14.026
Here's another one that'll probably...

36:15.482 --> 36:17.735
...turn out like King.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.917
Or Shrek or Escobar
or that punk from the other day.

36:24.908 --> 36:27.411
It says here
that you can launch a civil action.

36:27.410 --> 36:30.584
Sue them for damages
for reducing the quality of your life.

36:30.580 --> 36:34.881
King up in court.
Now, that'd be something.

36:34.876 --> 36:38.380
Oh, they'd work out a payment plan
for him, probably ten bucks a week.

36:38.379 --> 36:40.222
And he'd break that, pleading poverty.

36:40.215 --> 36:42.513
And they'd counsel him
and that would go nowhere

36:42.509 --> 36:45.934
and all the while we'd be the bad
bastards making his life miserable

36:45.929 --> 36:47.522
and be a fair target.

36:47.514 --> 36:49.061
We have to do something.

36:52.435 --> 36:54.187
Send her back when you've had enough.

36:54.187 --> 36:56.485
No, she's OK. Hello!

36:56.481 --> 36:58.028
Hello.

37:03.738 --> 37:06.036
Rule number three?

37:11.037 --> 37:12.584
Mm-hm.

37:12.580 --> 37:19.338
So Rupert and puppy can't
go through when no-one's watching

37:19.337 --> 37:20.964
and go on the road.

37:20.964 --> 37:23.308
- Very good!
- ARRRGGGH!

37:23.299 --> 37:26.018
Ha-ha-ha!

37:26.010 --> 37:28.684
-  ' Monkey!

38:00.753 --> 38:02.596
Be careful.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.570
Can I help you?

38:17.562 --> 38:19.564
Yeah, um...

38:19.564 --> 38:22.613
King wants to know
if you got a lighter.

38:22.609 --> 38:26.489
You know - cigarette lighter.

38:28.865 --> 38:32.665
Please, it's 20 past 2 in the morning

38:32.660 --> 38:36.039
and it's inappropriate to be knocking
on people's doors.

38:38.541 --> 38:40.714
But King wants to know.

38:42.503 --> 38:46.303
You can tell King
not to be such a coward.

38:46.299 --> 38:49.519
Sending over people like you.

38:51.387 --> 38:55.017
You can tell him to come over here
himself and I'll light up his night.

38:55.016 --> 38:57.189
Go on.

38:57.185 --> 38:59.279
But he wants to know.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.523
I told you to go.

39:02.565 --> 39:04.112
Go on.

39:05.818 --> 39:07.786
Fuck off.

39:13.326 --> 39:15.454
Fuck you.

39:29.717 --> 39:32.812
Hey, I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at King.

40:28.151 --> 40:30.279
Can you make out
what they're saying?

40:30.278 --> 40:32.531
No.

40:48.171 --> 40:51.141
Are you sure you don't want me
to come and pick you up?

40:51.132 --> 40:53.134
No, it's OK. I'll get the bus.

41:05.980 --> 41:08.654
What a useless prick!

41:10.485 --> 41:14.706
He said that the legal process
we would have to go through

41:14.697 --> 41:18.247
would be long, stressful and expensive,

41:18.242 --> 41:20.870
and, at the end of it,
we would probably be no better off.

41:20.870 --> 41:24.124
- What? No kiss?
- Oh, Max! Max!

41:24.123 --> 41:26.376
He said there's only
one thing we can do.

41:26.375 --> 41:28.548
- What's that?
- Wear earplugs.

41:28.544 --> 41:30.797
Useless bloody lawyers!

41:30.797 --> 41:34.097
What I can't understand is
how an intelligent person -

41:34.092 --> 41:38.563
two intelligent people -
cannot deal with this!

41:38.554 --> 41:40.648
How those dumb jerks next door

41:40.640 --> 41:42.938
just get away with
whatever it is they want to do

41:42.934 --> 41:44.561
and we just have to take it!

41:44.560 --> 41:46.733
Fucking helpless!

41:50.650 --> 41:53.278
Oh, Max!

41:56.155 --> 41:58.203
It's evolution.

41:58.199 --> 42:00.668
- Evolution?
- Evolution.

42:01.702 --> 42:03.955
We - well, you and I -

42:03.955 --> 42:06.754
we've got no street cunning left.

42:06.749 --> 42:11.300
In an evolutionary sense,
we're too far ahead.

42:11.295 --> 42:15.641
We can't compete with
those animals in the urban jungle.

42:15.633 --> 42:18.011
We're too civilized.

42:18.010 --> 42:19.512
Do you really think that?

42:20.555 --> 42:23.229
In a street fight,
we're no match for them.

42:23.224 --> 42:26.945
Civilized?
Useless against the barbarians.

42:26.936 --> 42:31.942
Intelligent? We've got nothing compared
to the rat-like street cunning

42:31.941 --> 42:33.614
that they've got.

42:33.609 --> 42:38.991
Maybe earplugs are the only solution.

42:42.493 --> 42:45.372
Yeah, well...

42:52.670 --> 42:55.173
I bought some.

42:56.507 --> 42:59.977
Come on. Let's go to bed.

42:59.969 --> 43:04.099
They've driven us
to drink, Maxy.

43:04.098 --> 43:06.942
You'll feel better about it
in the morning.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.575
I think we've been burgled.

44:02.531 --> 44:04.329
- Hello'?
- What?

44:04.325 --> 44:06.669
We've been robbed.

44:09.413 --> 44:13.543
My wallet, both mobiles and
the bowl of loose change that was there.

44:13.542 --> 44:16.091
Oh, my bag. Oh, fuck!

44:16.087 --> 44:19.307
My wallet, my cards, my iPod -
everything!

44:19.298 --> 44:21.141
Fuck! How did they get in?

44:21.133 --> 44:23.352
The door.
I must've forgotten to lock it. No!

44:23.344 --> 44:24.687
Then they got the keys!

44:24.679 --> 44:26.056
- That's the car.
- The car!

44:27.098 --> 44:29.817
Shit!

44:29.809 --> 44:32.779
So here's some information
for victims of crime.

44:32.770 --> 44:35.319
No, thanks. You've already
given us one of those.

44:35.314 --> 44:37.191
I doubt he'll find anything there.

44:37.191 --> 44:42.197
And I know 85% of these
types of crimes are never solved.

44:42.196 --> 44:44.369
It's more like 95%, actually.

44:44.365 --> 44:46.584
Oh, that makes it better, then.

44:46.575 --> 44:50.421
I guess you'll remember
to lock your doors from now on.

44:51.914 --> 44:53.507
See you later.

44:56.627 --> 44:59.426
...bank credit card,
your credit union debit card,

44:59.422 --> 45:02.266
your Medicare card, your Medibank card

45:02.258 --> 45:05.762
and your gym membership, although
I can't see how they'd use that.

45:05.761 --> 45:08.264
- God! This is horrible.
- What else?

45:08.264 --> 45:10.892
All the locks changed again.

45:10.891 --> 45:12.859
All our phone numbers
gone, all the cards

45:12.852 --> 45:14.604
that have to be stopped and replaced.

45:14.603 --> 45:16.150
What else?

45:17.606 --> 45:21.236
Oh, my God, my driver's license,
I forgot my driver's license. Damn!

45:21.235 --> 45:23.533
- I'll put that on the list.
- Bastards.

45:29.285 --> 45:32.084
Max, is it just a coincidence
they came around

45:32.079 --> 45:33.956
the one night the door wasn't locked?

45:35.916 --> 45:38.590
Or do they come around
every few days and check?

45:40.212 --> 45:43.307
Or do they come around
every night and check?

45:46.552 --> 45:48.270
Think about it.

45:50.848 --> 45:52.225
I don't wanna think about it.

45:53.267 --> 45:55.440
I don't wanna live my life like that.

45:55.436 --> 45:58.565
We don't know who did this.

45:58.564 --> 46:00.612
It's too much of a coincidence.

46:09.450 --> 46:12.624
You're right. You're right.

46:18.751 --> 46:20.594
It may not be you, King.

46:20.586 --> 46:23.305
In fact, I know it's not you.

46:23.297 --> 46:26.221
But they're your friends.
You allow this to happen.

46:26.217 --> 46:29.687
You cause it. I'm holding you
responsible if it happens again.

46:29.678 --> 46:32.557
I know, I know! I'm sorry. I know.

46:32.556 --> 46:35.105
In fact, I'm holding you
responsible for this one.

46:35.101 --> 46:38.025
I've a good mind to call the police
and tell them you caused it.

46:38.020 --> 46:41.024
Oh, shit, mate! Don't do that!
I never done it!

46:41.023 --> 46:44.744
Well, no, I'm... just thinking about it.

46:44.735 --> 46:46.737
I might know where your car is.

46:49.907 --> 46:53.081
I'll go and see 'em. I'll bring it back.

47:04.255 --> 47:07.259
King reckons he might
be able to find the car.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.477
He's part of it.

47:09.468 --> 47:11.687
He just said he might know where it is.

47:11.679 --> 47:14.228
He knows! He fucking knows!

47:16.434 --> 47:19.358
Look, King's back
with someone and a car.

47:21.188 --> 47:22.735
Start that fuckin' car!

47:24.108 --> 47:26.156
Oh, get the phone, get the phone!

47:26.152 --> 47:28.826
They're transferring the stash.
I'm calling the cops.

47:28.821 --> 47:30.915
Go, Max! The phone!

47:30.906 --> 47:34.501
The number plate.
I can't get the number plate.

47:34.493 --> 47:37.417
Go outside and get it as he drives out.

47:37.413 --> 47:39.006
The phone, the phone!

47:51.135 --> 47:54.730
We can't just wait for his sister
to wake up and kick him out.

47:54.722 --> 47:56.724
We have to get rid of him somehow.

47:56.724 --> 47:58.647
Why would he move out?

47:58.642 --> 48:02.021
And he can't sell the place,
although I'm sure he would if he could.

48:03.147 --> 48:05.616
The ice works in a funny way.

48:05.608 --> 48:08.862
He's on the edge
of paranoia all the time.

48:08.861 --> 48:11.740
Maybe we could tip him over the edge.

48:12.781 --> 48:14.704
Send him mad?

48:14.700 --> 48:17.544
Just make him believe that someone

48:17.536 --> 48:20.756
or a whole group of different people
are out to get him.

48:20.748 --> 48:22.466
Not us, but like, his own kind.

48:22.458 --> 48:26.554
Dealers, customers who aren't satisfied.
Even Escobar or Shrek.

48:30.841 --> 48:34.266
Just make him afraid
to be living in that house.

48:36.305 --> 48:38.103
Mmm.

48:39.934 --> 48:44.531
So we should start off
with the warning on the front fence.

48:44.522 --> 48:48.447
I think it's important for him to start
to worry as to who it might be.

48:48.442 --> 48:50.444
It's all in the wording.

48:50.444 --> 48:53.869
We could scatter nails
out the front of his house

48:53.864 --> 48:56.162
so that all the customers
get ï¬‚at tires.

48:56.158 --> 48:59.037
Maybe better - how about this?

48:59.036 --> 49:02.415
To superglue
some sort of pins on the roadway.

49:02.414 --> 49:05.543
That might work better, and then
he would know it was deliberate.

49:05.543 --> 49:08.137
Every time he replaces one,
we should break it again.

49:08.128 --> 49:11.678
King doesn't replace his broken windows,
so how does that work?

49:12.883 --> 49:15.432
- I've got it.
- Yeah, what?

49:15.427 --> 49:20.149
The wording. 'Rip-off
drug dealer lives here.'

49:21.475 --> 49:24.945
Close. Just a bit not angry enough.

49:24.937 --> 49:26.484
How about...

49:28.232 --> 49:31.486
'Rip-off drug-dealing scum'?

49:31.485 --> 49:33.738
'Lives here'. You have
to have the 'lives here'

49:33.737 --> 49:36.741
otherwise it could be interpreted
as a general sort of message.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.788
'Rip-off drug-dealing scum lives here.'

49:57.928 --> 49:59.555
Hey, Mack.

50:00.806 --> 50:02.729
- Max.
- Oh.

50:02.725 --> 50:06.525
Do you reckon, uh, I could have
some of those bottles

50:06.520 --> 50:08.238
worth a bit of money?

50:08.230 --> 50:09.823
I gotta make some phone calls

50:09.815 --> 50:12.910
and maybe get me something
to eat, a burger like.

50:12.901 --> 50:16.201
You know? Me pension doesn't
come through till Thursday.

50:17.823 --> 50:19.621
Well, I...

50:19.617 --> 50:22.837
It doesn't matter if you can't.
I understand.

50:22.828 --> 50:24.830
No, no, that's not what I meant.

50:24.830 --> 50:28.255
It's just that somebody
comes to collect these bottles.

50:29.501 --> 50:31.503
But just...

50:37.509 --> 50:39.637
Take this.

50:39.637 --> 50:43.107
Now you can get yourself a burger
and make some phone calls.

50:43.098 --> 50:45.977
Pay me back whenever you can.

50:45.976 --> 50:48.946
Sure. Thanks, Mack.

50:48.937 --> 50:51.065
Me pension comes on Thursday.

51:11.210 --> 51:13.087
Pathetic.

51:29.561 --> 51:32.030
I don't think we ought to do it.

51:34.066 --> 51:35.613
Why not?

51:35.609 --> 51:38.283
'Cause we're not like this.

51:39.905 --> 51:44.126
It's been fun thinking about it
and useful to get the anger out,

51:44.118 --> 51:46.371
but this isn't us.

51:46.370 --> 51:49.374
What happened to patience and tolerance?

51:51.125 --> 51:53.674
They wore a bit thin after a while.

51:55.713 --> 51:59.308
Let's go back to thinking about
the brighter side of things.

51:59.299 --> 52:05.648
Because it's true - they are more
interesting than dull neighbours.

52:05.639 --> 52:11.646
And... there's something
so pathetic about King.

52:18.026 --> 52:20.404
OK.

52:20.404 --> 52:22.623
Get it out there!
- Fuckin' come on.

52:22.614 --> 52:24.833
- Fuck off!
- Fuckin' hurry up.

52:24.825 --> 52:28.250
Here goes. One, two, three.

52:38.088 --> 52:40.386
- Hey!
- Hello.

52:43.635 --> 52:45.512
Hello!

52:45.512 --> 52:47.731
Hi.

52:53.312 --> 52:54.859
Garlic fingers.

52:57.107 --> 53:01.032
Saw that!

53:01.028 --> 53:02.746
Guess what.

53:02.738 --> 53:04.285
What?

53:04.281 --> 53:07.831
The police called.
I went to the station.

53:07.826 --> 53:09.373
They found the car.

53:11.205 --> 53:12.957
Burnt out? It's been trashed?

53:12.956 --> 53:16.130
Apparently not bad. They're holding it
until it's fingerprinted.

53:16.126 --> 53:18.299
But they know who did it.

53:18.295 --> 53:22.675
Found it in his backyard when they went
to question him for something else.

53:23.717 --> 53:27.392
I saw his photo.
I've seen him next door.

53:27.387 --> 53:29.105
So they've got him?

53:32.518 --> 53:35.692
He's got a record as long as your arm
and he's out on parole,

53:35.687 --> 53:38.361
but because he would go
straight back to jail,

53:38.357 --> 53:40.735
he's got his girlfriend
to say that she did it

53:40.734 --> 53:42.828
and she'll get off with a bond.

53:42.820 --> 53:47.371
And the police reckon that she's going
to say that she found it abandoned

53:47.366 --> 53:49.915
in the street
with the keys still inside it.

53:49.910 --> 53:53.039
So she avoids the charge
for the theft as well!

53:53.038 --> 53:55.211
Oh, no.

53:58.794 --> 54:01.547
For society to function properly,

54:01.547 --> 54:07.145
it relies on people following
a set of basic and minimum rules.

54:07.135 --> 54:09.388
If they refuse to,
then they have no place in it

54:09.388 --> 54:11.186
and they should be driven out.

54:11.181 --> 54:12.854
That's the way it's always worked.

54:12.850 --> 54:16.150
And as society becomes
more and more complex,

54:16.144 --> 54:19.694
it becomes more and more important
that this be the case.

54:19.690 --> 54:23.160
Though it's harder and harder to police.

54:23.151 --> 54:26.906
There's no way that the cops have
the resources to deal with all this.

54:26.905 --> 54:28.873
They can barely keep the traffic moving.

54:28.866 --> 54:32.712
Therefore, we are justified
in taking action.

54:32.703 --> 54:36.253
Local action, for the greater good
of our society.

54:36.248 --> 54:38.125
The petrol bomb principle?

54:38.125 --> 54:40.594
No, no, no petrol bombs.

54:40.586 --> 54:42.463
I'm just joking.

54:42.462 --> 54:44.715
But that sort of settles it, doesn't it?

54:48.427 --> 54:49.974
I guess it does.

54:49.970 --> 54:55.898
So I slip back inside, and if anyone
comes to the door, you answer it

54:55.893 --> 54:58.396
and tell them you heard
someone running down the side

54:58.395 --> 55:00.397
towards the back fence.

55:00.397 --> 55:03.446
By that time, I'll have changed
out of my disguise

55:03.442 --> 55:07.242
and I'll come wandering up
sleepily in my tracksuit

55:07.237 --> 55:08.864
and I'll take them back there.

55:16.163 --> 55:19.133
This is where we will...

55:23.462 --> 55:26.261
...discover the broken trellis,
which is where

55:26.256 --> 55:28.725
they must've gotten over the back fence.

55:28.717 --> 55:29.889
Good.

55:29.885 --> 55:32.013
Probably won't happen,
but you never know.

55:32.012 --> 55:34.640
What about paint? We need paint.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.734
We have that tin of purple
we didn't use.

55:36.725 --> 55:38.272
They'll never trace it.

55:43.315 --> 55:44.908
Maybe I should just do it.

55:44.900 --> 55:49.201
No. I don't want you
getting tangled up with them.

55:49.196 --> 55:50.743
Who knows what they'll do?

55:50.739 --> 55:55.791
You're the brains of this operation.
Your mind's more perverse.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.914
I'll do the physical stuff.

56:00.582 --> 56:04.587
Yeah. What the fuck do you want?

56:04.586 --> 56:07.055
You son of a bitch!

56:12.970 --> 56:15.268
Hopeless.

56:29.987 --> 56:32.160
'Drug-dealing scum live here.'

56:32.155 --> 56:36.410
'Rip-off drug-dealing scum live here.'

56:36.410 --> 56:39.664
Remember, we want King to think
it's a dissatisfied customer.

56:39.663 --> 56:41.256
Yes, of course.

56:41.248 --> 56:43.922
What do you do with
the paint when you're done?

56:43.917 --> 56:47.262
I throw the paint into King's yard.

56:50.215 --> 56:51.933
Hey.

57:26.585 --> 57:29.179
Lid... off.

57:39.931 --> 57:42.229
Shit!

57:44.895 --> 57:47.068
Come on! Come on!

57:50.192 --> 57:52.194
Shit!

57:52.194 --> 57:53.946
Bugged

58:01.036 --> 58:03.789
- What happened?
- The paint's not working.

58:10.712 --> 58:14.433
You forgot to stir it!

58:14.424 --> 58:17.223
Me? We both forgot to stir it!

58:17.219 --> 58:20.018
This paint is old. How was
I supposed to know?

58:20.013 --> 58:22.687
Oh, my poor boy! Mwah!

58:22.682 --> 58:25.356
- Argh!
- You should have seen your face.

58:25.352 --> 58:27.696
'The paint's not working!'

58:27.687 --> 58:30.156
- Don't!

58:30.148 --> 58:33.527
Oh. It's all very, very stupid

58:33.527 --> 58:35.154
and we should give it up now.

58:35.153 --> 58:38.202
- It is stupid.

58:38.198 --> 58:39.871
And we should. We should.

58:39.866 --> 58:42.870
Shush!

58:42.869 --> 58:44.963
'The paint's not working!'

58:44.955 --> 58:47.674
- 'The paint's not working!'
- Shush!

58:49.209 --> 58:51.086
King!

58:51.086 --> 58:53.180
King! Hey!

58:53.171 --> 58:55.845
I'm gonna get some ciggies.
You want some?

58:55.841 --> 58:58.765
Ciggies? Yeah, yeah.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.889
Yeah.

59:21.575 --> 59:24.249
Hello! Hello?

01:00:02.782 --> 01:00:04.876
Yeah, fuck off!

01:00:10.123 --> 01:00:13.172
She's pissed herself!
What a fuckin' baby!

01:00:13.168 --> 01:00:14.886
- Mirabelle!

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:17.381
Get a fuckin' potty!

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.133
You fuckin' little sock!

01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:22.227
Fuck off!

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.597
- You fuckin' crybaby!
- Fuck off!

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:33.735
You OK? It's OK. It's OK.

01:00:48.662 --> 01:00:50.460
We didn't fuckin' touch her.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.094
- Fuck off!

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:09.479
I've got the best idea.

01:01:19.317 --> 01:01:22.161
Go on. I'm keen to hear it.

01:01:26.408 --> 01:01:29.503
We get into King's house
when he's not there...

01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:33.585
...and plant some
of our own stuff in there.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:38.470
Hide it, so that King can't
easily find it, but the cops will.

01:01:40.171 --> 01:01:42.765
Maybe the icons and some other stuff.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:46.936
And then fake a robbery here.

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.775
Get King in here first to get
his fingerprints on some stuff

01:01:51.766 --> 01:01:54.144
so that they can pin it on him,

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:59.275
and then plant the stuff
and then call the cops.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:04.948
Maybe a few broad hints
that we reckon it's King.

01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:22.093
Might need some refining,
but you're right.

01:02:24.257 --> 01:02:26.055
It's the best idea.

01:02:29.095 --> 01:02:30.722
How's Mirabelle?

01:02:30.722 --> 01:02:33.225
She won't come out of her room,

01:02:33.224 --> 01:02:36.444
except to go to the bathroom,
and even then Maria has to go with her.

01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:39.485
Maria has had to take time off work.

01:02:41.149 --> 01:02:43.948
- Bastards.
- So sorry, Otto.

01:02:43.943 --> 01:02:48.574
No, no, it's my fault.
I forgot to padlock our side.

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.872
We'll leave one of these on the ï¬‚oor
when we fake the robbery.

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.965
Oh, my icons.

01:02:56.956 --> 01:03:00.506
It's OK. We'll get them back afterwards.

01:03:02.253 --> 01:03:03.880
King!

01:03:08.676 --> 01:03:10.553
King!

01:03:12.472 --> 01:03:14.941
You there, King?

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.732
Sorry I haven't got
that ten bucks for you.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.275
No, no, it's nothing like that.

01:03:20.271 --> 01:03:23.115
I wanted to ask you a favour and I...

01:03:23.108 --> 01:03:24.951
There might be something in it for you.

01:03:24.943 --> 01:03:26.820
Yeah?

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.914
Yeah. Can you come over
in a few minutes?

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:31.374
I wanna show you something.
I wanna ask you about it.

01:03:31.366 --> 01:03:33.869
Yeah, I just gotta wash my face.

01:03:53.138 --> 01:03:55.186
There's two good prints.

01:03:55.181 --> 01:03:56.979
Yeah.

01:03:56.975 --> 01:03:59.148
Hey, King.

01:03:59.144 --> 01:04:01.488
You want a beer?

01:04:02.897 --> 01:04:04.899
Beer. Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:04.899 --> 01:04:10.247
Therese, get a beer for King,
and one for me too.

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:15.372
So we got these, see?

01:04:16.911 --> 01:04:19.915
And we wanna sell all of these,
but we got no idea how to go about it

01:04:19.914 --> 01:04:22.087
because they're black.

01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:24.256
Hmm.

01:04:24.252 --> 01:04:26.755
Don't look black.

01:04:26.754 --> 01:04:29.473
Well, they are. They're really black.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:32.561
Black? Black.

01:04:32.552 --> 01:04:36.147
You know - you don't ask
where they come from.

01:04:37.182 --> 01:04:39.901
Oh, you mean 'hot'.

01:04:39.893 --> 01:04:43.113
Hot, black, what's the difference?

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:45.990
Yeah. What's the difference.

01:04:47.025 --> 01:04:49.198
Look at the workmanship on that, hmm?

01:04:49.194 --> 01:04:51.413
Some of these date back
to the 16th century.

01:04:54.449 --> 01:04:55.996
Oh, yeah.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.245
They're good.

01:04:59.871 --> 01:05:02.340
I'm sorry. I didn't think
he was gonna take one away,

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.801
- I had no choice.
- We do it tonight.

01:05:04.792 --> 01:05:08.342
- If he goes out.
- Yeah, of course if he goes out.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:11.182
You're mad about the icon.

01:05:13.301 --> 01:05:16.054
Sometimes I just wanna kill him.

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:19.940
Mm-mm. Fingerprints.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.113
- What's this?
- Don't ask.

01:05:29.108 --> 01:05:30.655
Therese...

01:05:30.652 --> 01:05:33.121
There's enough there
to put him in jail for a spell.

01:05:34.948 --> 01:05:37.872
- Where did you get this?
- Don't ask. I'm on watch.

01:05:58.429 --> 01:06:01.182
He's gone. I'm gonna take watch outside.

01:06:09.524 --> 01:06:12.323
Stay in the shadows, whatever you do.

01:06:12.318 --> 01:06:15.322
- Is my number dialled in?
- Yep.

01:06:17.448 --> 01:06:19.246
Yours on vibrate?

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.290
Yep.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.463
- All set?
- Yep.

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.763
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

01:07:01.868 --> 01:07:03.415
What?

01:07:05.496 --> 01:07:08.420
What? You scared the hell out of me.

01:07:13.212 --> 01:07:15.055
Shit!

01:07:25.266 --> 01:07:27.268
Fuck!

01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:28.861
Argh!

01:07:30.772 --> 01:07:33.696
Shit!

01:09:35.813 --> 01:09:37.359
What are you doing here?

01:09:37.356 --> 01:09:40.451
I called because a car
cruised by looking for a deal

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:42.194
and you didn't answer.

01:09:43.488 --> 01:09:45.331
Shit! I've lost it.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.460
It was outside the window.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.830
Thank you.

01:09:51.828 --> 01:09:54.252
Oh, my God!

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.002
This is disgusting!

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.721
You should go back on watch.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.739
Are you all right?

01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:30.710
Yeah. Switch on the torch.

01:10:30.701 --> 01:10:32.248
I've lost it.

01:10:32.245 --> 01:10:34.964
Oh. Is he okay?

01:10:34.956 --> 01:10:36.503
Yeah, yeah. He's out of it.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:39.719
Out of it okay,
or out of it not okay?

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:41.257
He should be okay.

01:10:41.254 --> 01:10:43.006
But he's not moving.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.632
That's because he's out of it.

01:10:44.632 --> 01:10:47.181
Yeah, he's always out of it,
but he's usually moving.

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.099
Is he breathing?

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.862
Shh!

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:07.121
I can't hear him breathe.

01:11:07.113 --> 01:11:10.037
I can't either.
That's because he's unconscious.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.376
Oh, so he's unconscious now,
not just out of it.

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:15.121
- Let's get out of here.
- I think we should check his pulse.

01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:18.546
A few hours ago, you wanted to kill him,
now you want me to check his pulse!

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.839
I am not doing anything
until I know that he's OK.

01:11:20.835 --> 01:11:23.429
Then we can anonymously
call an ambulance.

01:11:23.421 --> 01:11:26.595
You can put on one of your voices.
You can pretend you're his friend.

01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:29.891
'Hey, motherfucker,
dude. My buddy needs a ride.'

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:30.933
Shush!

01:11:30.928 --> 01:11:33.681
'In your white machine,
'cause he nearly died!'

01:11:33.681 --> 01:11:35.399
Very funny.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.357
I can't find a pulse.

01:11:42.356 --> 01:11:45.280
Here, let me try. I've got
a Senior First Aid certificate.

01:11:45.276 --> 01:11:48.325
- Try the other arm.
- What difference would that make?

01:11:48.321 --> 01:11:52.326
Maybe he's been injecting or something
and collapsed the veins.

01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:54.669
Max, I thought you were
a science teacher.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.662
I'm looking for an artery, not a vein.

01:11:56.662 --> 01:11:58.630
Yes, of course.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.505
I can't find anything.

01:12:06.881 --> 01:12:09.009
- Switch on the light.
- What?!

01:12:09.008 --> 01:12:12.137
Sorry. Please. Would you
switch on the light, please Max!

01:12:12.136 --> 01:12:14.230
All right. No need to get narky.

01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:15.894
Do you reckon it's safe to?

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:18.359
If he's dead,
it's not gonna get any worse.

01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:21.525
Oh, my God, he's dead! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.490
Close his eyes, close his eyes.
I can't stand them staring.

01:12:24.482 --> 01:12:27.656
- I don't think I should touch him.
- Please, Max, please!

01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:31.577
Please. If I accidentally
even glance at him again,

01:12:31.572 --> 01:12:33.324
I'm gonna start screaming.

01:12:48.756 --> 01:12:50.474
You can look now.

01:13:00.851 --> 01:13:02.603
What are we gonna do?

01:13:06.065 --> 01:13:07.942
I don't know.

01:13:17.702 --> 01:13:19.704
We have to call the police.

01:13:19.704 --> 01:13:21.251
And tell them what?

01:13:21.247 --> 01:13:24.547
That we broke in and when he came home
to his own house, I bumped him off?

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:27.341
You didn't need to kill him.
He was just holding onto my arm.

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.430
It was dark.
You were screaming, remember?

01:13:29.422 --> 01:13:31.766
- It was an accident.
- So that'll be your defense?

01:13:31.757 --> 01:13:34.431
- What?
- That it was an accident.

01:13:34.427 --> 01:13:36.976
- My defense?
- That's what's gonna happen!

01:13:45.896 --> 01:13:48.240
I say we don't call the cops.

01:13:48.232 --> 01:13:50.200
I agree.

01:13:52.403 --> 01:13:54.701
Or maybe we do, and we tell them

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:57.291
that we heard noises
and shouting from next door

01:13:57.283 --> 01:13:59.285
and then we saw two guys walking out

01:13:59.285 --> 01:14:02.380
and one of them saying to the other,
'You didn't need to kill him.'

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:03.998
But then the police will come here

01:14:03.998 --> 01:14:06.421
and declare the whole place
a major crime scene.

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:08.966
Forensics will find
your prints everywhere.

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:12.757
And my... my blood!

01:14:12.757 --> 01:14:14.350
Your blood? Show me.

01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:18.896
I cut it climbing in on the window.
Who knows where I've spread it.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:22.392
- No cops.
- No cops.

01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:27.071
We can't just leave him here.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.940
Why not?

01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:31.067
Can we?

01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:34.658
We lock up and we leave.

01:14:34.653 --> 01:14:39.079
It'll be weeks before Shrek and Escobar
figure something's wrong and break in.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:41.669
What do you reckon they'll do
when they find the body?

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:47.042
They'll freak and be out of here so fast
they'll be falling all over each other.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.464
Right. Exactly right.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:53.889
And then they'll call the cops.

01:15:01.639 --> 01:15:06.315
What if we injected him
with a lethal overdose

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:08.529
of some of that stuff you got?

01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:10.364
Maybe that'd do it.

01:15:10.356 --> 01:15:12.950
The cops won't care.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:15.536
It's one more problem off their books.

01:15:15.528 --> 01:15:18.577
Maybe that'd put them off the scent.

01:15:20.324 --> 01:15:21.871
What scent?

01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:24.962
The scent that leads to us.

01:15:27.164 --> 01:15:29.383
You'd be killing him twice.

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:31.218
A double murderer.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.804
- It was an accident.
- I'm joking.

01:15:43.389 --> 01:15:45.357
Maybe we should just hide him.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:53.616
If he's gone, no-one's gonna
even miss him. How tragic.

01:15:55.276 --> 01:15:57.779
They'd just think
he's on the run from someone.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.160
Where hide him?

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.543
I don't know where.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:16.131
We could collect his mail
and pay his bills.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:21.136
In cash, at different post offices.

01:16:21.135 --> 01:16:22.682
Wherever.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.984
No-one would suspect anything.

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:43.825
You're on to something.

01:16:49.455 --> 01:16:52.755
We can hide him up there.
In the roof cavity up in there.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:55.003
- Won't that stink?
- I don't think so.

01:16:55.002 --> 01:16:58.256
It's so hot and dry,
he'll probably mummify.

01:16:58.255 --> 01:17:01.179
That's if the rats
don't completely consume him.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:05.813
Then we clean up the fingerprints
and the blood.

01:17:05.804 --> 01:17:07.431
No, no, no, no,

01:17:07.431 --> 01:17:10.605
we take his blood and put it
over wherever my blood is

01:17:10.601 --> 01:17:13.445
and we rub dirt wherever
your fingerprints may be.

01:17:13.437 --> 01:17:15.360
Are you sure?

01:17:15.356 --> 01:17:16.949
It's brilliant, Therese.

01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:21.117
If we get found out about the bills,
we'll say he gave us a wad of cash

01:17:21.111 --> 01:17:23.580
and told us to take care of it
for a few months.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.324
And how did he get up there?

01:17:25.324 --> 01:17:26.997
Well, who knows?

01:17:26.992 --> 01:17:30.792
They won't find him until they sell the
place and that could be years away.

01:17:30.788 --> 01:17:32.586
Not until his sister dies.

01:17:33.624 --> 01:17:36.047
What do you think?

01:17:36.043 --> 01:17:38.466
This could be the way.

01:17:48.472 --> 01:17:50.600
Back door.

01:17:55.813 --> 01:17:57.360
Anything up there?

01:17:57.356 --> 01:18:00.951
Bags of junk, rat droppings.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.787
It's perfect.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:08.660
Pass me up the block
and tackle thing and the cord.

01:18:08.659 --> 01:18:10.753
What?

01:18:10.744 --> 01:18:12.417
The wheel thingy.

01:18:12.413 --> 01:18:14.040
You mean the pulley?

01:18:14.039 --> 01:18:16.007
The pulley wheel thingy.

01:18:24.508 --> 01:18:26.681
- Got it?
- Got it. Thanks.

01:18:41.275 --> 01:18:43.403
OK, let's lift him up.

01:18:45.362 --> 01:18:48.832
OK, put his... put his arm
over your shoulder.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:53.079
OK? OK, you ready?
We're gonna lift him up.

01:18:53.078 --> 01:18:56.082
One, two...

01:18:56.081 --> 01:18:57.879
Christ, he's heavy!

01:18:59.752 --> 01:19:02.471
- Awkward!

01:19:02.463 --> 01:19:04.010
He's really awkward and heavy.

01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:07.476
Maybe we should just wait
for rigor mortis to set in.

01:19:07.468 --> 01:19:09.015
That'll be hours.

01:19:10.137 --> 01:19:14.688
OK, one more and we'll...
and we'll get him this time. Yep.

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.356
- Yes.
- OK.

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:19.105
So, once again.

01:19:20.647 --> 01:19:23.776
So... lift him up.

01:19:25.903 --> 01:19:28.952
OK. OK, and put... put...

01:19:28.947 --> 01:19:32.201
Put your head under his arm.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:34.295
' - Yep? OK.

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:36.209
OK, OK.

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.378
One, two...

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:40.047
Oh, my God! He stinks.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:44.013
I can't... I can't...
I can't... I can't...

01:19:44.004 --> 01:19:45.881
I can't put my face near his armpit.

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:48.930
- Oh!
- Oh. Oh...

01:19:50.803 --> 01:19:52.350
- It's OK.
- Mm-hm.

01:19:52.346 --> 01:19:53.893
- OK?
- It's OK.

01:19:57.935 --> 01:19:59.903
We're gonna drag him.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:02.398
Yeah?

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:03.945
We'll drag him.

01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:07.491
OK. Get his arm.

01:20:07.486 --> 01:20:10.786
- Yep.
- And put... one hand under here.

01:20:10.781 --> 01:20:12.328
No, not the armpit.

01:20:12.324 --> 01:20:14.918
You've got gloves on.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.083
I don't care.
These are my washing-up gloves.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.626
Let's drag him by the feet.

01:20:19.665 --> 01:20:21.417
Yeah, yeah. OK, yeah.

01:20:25.295 --> 01:20:28.048
OK. Through this door here.

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:34.805
Now, take the strain.

01:20:34.805 --> 01:20:36.807
What?

01:20:36.807 --> 01:20:38.354
Take the strain.

01:20:39.893 --> 01:20:44.774
Um... pull the rope, not too hard,
and take up the slack.

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.946
OK, that's good.

01:20:48.902 --> 01:20:50.825
OK.

01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:54.917
Now, reach up as high
as you can with your hands.

01:20:54.908 --> 01:20:58.913
And we'll... we'll pull down
using our... using our body weight.

01:20:58.912 --> 01:21:00.710
- Yep?
- Yep, yep-

01:21:00.706 --> 01:21:02.583
- Here we go.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:39.996
OK, good. Going well.

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:43.632
Come around, come around, come around.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.714
- OK.
- Yep.

01:21:48.378 --> 01:21:50.005
Oh, Christ, he's heavy!

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:57.851
Must've jammed. Jumped the wheel.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.723
I'll have to go up.

01:22:09.733 --> 01:22:11.735
Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:15.989 --> 01:22:17.662
King!

01:22:20.953 --> 01:22:22.580
What the fuck is going on here?

01:22:23.622 --> 01:22:25.295
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:27.793 --> 01:22:30.967
You're that fuckin' next-door neighbour.
What are you doing here?

01:22:30.963 --> 01:22:33.637
I think the King is dead.

01:22:33.632 --> 01:22:35.179
Huh?

01:22:35.175 --> 01:22:40.898
Yeah, yep. Um... I...
I was helping the King do a deal.

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.516
We were gonna do a deal together.

01:22:42.516 --> 01:22:44.644
You? You and the King?

01:22:44.643 --> 01:22:51.276
Yeah, just some dope, and he sort of
attack and started bleeding.

01:22:51.275 --> 01:22:54.449
And I was trying to save him.

01:22:54.444 --> 01:22:57.288
You know how if you string them up
like that,

01:22:57.281 --> 01:23:01.161
their heart can fuckin'
start beating again?

01:23:04.329 --> 01:23:06.627
I've never heard of that.

01:23:06.623 --> 01:23:08.170
You?

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.962
No.

01:23:11.962 --> 01:23:14.932
Don't you fuckin' lie to me,
you pink-gloved cunt! You hear me?

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:18.177
- It's true. I have Senior First Aid...
- Who the fuck asked you?!

01:23:18.176 --> 01:23:22.727
Yeah! Who the fuck did ask you?!

01:23:31.481 --> 01:23:33.404
I love ya! Mwah!

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.243
I fuckin' love this cunt!

01:23:39.865 --> 01:23:41.913
I wanna...

01:23:47.497 --> 01:23:49.591
There's fuckin' rats up there.

01:23:50.876 --> 01:23:52.628
What?

01:23:56.673 --> 01:23:58.516
Fuckin' rats up there.

01:23:58.508 --> 01:24:01.728
- No, no, there's no...
- There are fuckin' rats up there!

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.566
You were gonna put King up there
for the rats to eat, you low-life cunt!

01:24:05.557 --> 01:24:07.559
- Come here, come here!
- Hey!

01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:09.812
I'm gonna put a fuckin'
broomstick up your arse

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.404
until you're bits of shish kebab!

01:24:11.396 --> 01:24:13.444
- No!
- Get a fuckin' broom. Get a broom.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.785
We're gonna have
some fuckin' fun with this cunt.

01:24:16.777 --> 01:24:19.496
Huh? Until we fuckin' string you up
and put you up the roof

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:21.661
for the fuckin' rats to eat ya!

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:24.456
Stay still! Stay still!

01:24:24.451 --> 01:24:26.749
Or I'll do your fuckin' missus
as well, huh?

01:24:26.745 --> 01:24:32.297
I'll stick a broom into her! Chicken!
Ch-chicken and lamb shish kebabs!

01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:35.045
Lamb shish kebab. Huh?

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:39.091
What the fuck happened to you?

01:24:39.091 --> 01:24:42.345
Did you collide into a door,
you clumsy cunt?

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:43.891
He'll be all right.

01:24:43.887 --> 01:24:46.436
Only a love tap.

01:24:47.474 --> 01:24:49.192
Take a seat, princess.

01:24:50.394 --> 01:24:53.568
Where's fucking King?
I'm gonna kill the cunt!

01:24:55.315 --> 01:24:57.784
What the fuck is going on here?

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:02.915
We come to kill you, King.

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:06.206
He's already dead.

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.454
What the fuck?

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.709
Fuckin' owed me plenty. Wouldn't pay.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:18.431
I made an example of him.
I fuckin' killed him.

01:25:18.422 --> 01:25:20.299
You said
he had a fuckin' heart attack.

01:25:20.298 --> 01:25:21.845
Shut up, cunt!

01:25:21.842 --> 01:25:24.846
This cunt is talkin' to that cunt,

01:25:24.845 --> 01:25:27.849
- not you, you cunt!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:25:30.517 --> 01:25:32.645
I thought I told you to fuckin' shut up!

01:25:34.646 --> 01:25:37.149
Shut up means fucking shut up, you cunt!

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.953
Shut up, cunt!

01:25:48.368 --> 01:25:51.292
It doesn't mean saying fucking sorry!

01:25:51.288 --> 01:25:54.918
Saying fucking sorry is fucking talking

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:57.715
when I said fucking shut up, cunt!

01:26:09.806 --> 01:26:12.434
Moaning is like talking.

01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:17.022
Good boy.

01:26:22.694 --> 01:26:25.163
Well, I told you...

01:26:25.155 --> 01:26:27.874
He owed me!

01:26:27.866 --> 01:26:29.960
I warned him.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.921
He wouldn't pay up, the cunt,
so I done him in.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:38.593
Reckon I done youse a favour.

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:53.567
That cunt you just did in
owes me 30,000 fuckin' dollars.

01:26:56.436 --> 01:26:59.736
Don't mind the snot.
It was meant for King.

01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:04.612
Didn't know some other cunt'd be
wearing it, or I'd a washed it.

01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:08.036
And if you're extremely lucky, we'll
find the fucking cash in the house.

01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:10.375
King... Someone wouldn't...

01:27:10.367 --> 01:27:14.417
No, no... King doesn't have any money.

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:16.631
He was gonna lend it.

01:27:16.623 --> 01:27:21.220
He was wanted to lend it,
but they wouldn't...

01:27:28.593 --> 01:27:30.311
This your turf?

01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:33.557
Is this your fucking turf?!

01:27:39.396 --> 01:27:41.398
See that bloke?

01:27:58.582 --> 01:28:00.630
He doesn't know a thing.

01:28:00.625 --> 01:28:03.674
His mother dropped him on his head
when he was a baby.

01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:05.843
He's an innocent.

01:28:05.839 --> 01:28:08.638
You, on the other hand,
are not a fucking innocent.

01:28:08.633 --> 01:28:10.601
You're fucking scum!

01:28:10.594 --> 01:28:13.063
Muscling in on my fucking territory!

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:15.022
Killing one of my fuckin' dealers

01:28:15.015 --> 01:28:16.983
who owes me a fuckin' shitload of money

01:28:16.975 --> 01:28:19.649
that he will now never fuckin' pay!

01:28:19.644 --> 01:28:22.818
You're fucking dead.

01:28:22.814 --> 01:28:24.566
He's bullshitting you.

01:28:26.651 --> 01:28:29.404
We're King's neighbours from next door.

01:28:34.034 --> 01:28:36.378
I'm Therese. Hello.

01:28:38.955 --> 01:28:40.628
And this is Max.

01:28:40.624 --> 01:28:45.471
He's a harmless science teacher,
not some fucking tough drug dealer.

01:28:45.462 --> 01:28:48.136
You can see what a fucking nerd he is.

01:28:57.807 --> 01:29:00.185
How come King's dead then?

01:29:00.185 --> 01:29:04.110
It was an accident. King
was drug-fucked and he went for me,

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:08.531
and then Max shoved him
and he hit his head badly.

01:29:08.526 --> 01:29:11.530
He fell and then bang, dead.

01:29:14.991 --> 01:29:16.914
Mmm.

01:29:29.089 --> 01:29:30.966
Talk some science to me.

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:33.060
What?

01:29:33.051 --> 01:29:37.056
Talk some science. I wanna check
if you're really a science teacher.

01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:41.560
Um... H2O.

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.697
That's water.

01:29:48.024 --> 01:29:50.072
Everybody fuckin' knows that.

01:29:50.068 --> 01:29:51.866
Talk some real science.

01:29:51.861 --> 01:29:53.488
I'm fuckin' trying.

01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:55.786
You're a fuckin' useless
science teacher then.

01:29:55.782 --> 01:29:57.876
Like mine was. Hated the cunt.

01:29:57.867 --> 01:30:00.211
OK, OK. Um... What do you want?

01:30:00.203 --> 01:30:02.376
Chemistry, physics or biology?

01:30:02.372 --> 01:30:04.124
Don't be a smart cunt or I'll do you in.

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:06.218
Put the kids out
of their fuckin' misery,

01:30:06.209 --> 01:30:08.052
having you as their science teacher.

01:30:08.044 --> 01:30:11.014
OK, OK. Fuckin' fuck...

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:13.555
- Come on!
- Jeez, I'd have hated you.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.434
OK, OK.

01:30:19.806 --> 01:30:24.733
The stress-strain ratio
is a constant, K,

01:30:24.728 --> 01:30:27.652
known as the elastic modulus.

01:30:27.647 --> 01:30:32.027
In a linear extension,
K equals force over area

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:35.531
divided by extension over load.

01:30:37.073 --> 01:30:40.452
What did he say?
Sounds like bullshit. Is it science?

01:30:40.452 --> 01:30:42.125
Hooke's law.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.044
You can work out how much force you need

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.340
to deform a material
by a certain amount.

01:30:48.334 --> 01:30:51.087
Sounds more like doing normal business.

01:30:51.087 --> 01:30:53.215
Is it science?

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.137
Sorry, bro. It's physics.

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:00.476
Fuck!

01:31:02.182 --> 01:31:04.105
That's it, then. I'm fucked!

01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.148
Fuck!

01:31:13.443 --> 01:31:15.411
We free to go now?

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:18.077
I got some maths for you.

01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:22.670
- King owes me 30,000 fuckin' dollars.
- Mmm.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:26.881
You killed King.
Therefore, you owe me...

01:31:26.873 --> 01:31:29.126
...40,000 fuckin' dollars.

01:31:29.125 --> 01:31:31.002
How do you like that?

01:31:31.002 --> 01:31:34.927
Must've had a lousy maths teacher too.

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:41.271
What'd you do that for?

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:44.607
My law - force over shins equals pain!

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:46.818
Warned you not to be a smart cunt.

01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:49.654
The extra $10,000 is interest.

01:31:49.646 --> 01:31:52.195
25% for the trouble you caused.

01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:54.443
25% would be $37,500.

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:55.989
Max!

01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:59.072
How do you live with this cunt?

01:31:59.072 --> 01:32:01.291
He's not normally like this.

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:04.161
Old warrior instincts
are being awakened.

01:32:05.995 --> 01:32:07.622
It's all that male bonding.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.171
- Don't reckon you'd be too easy either.
- Hmm.

01:32:10.166 --> 01:32:14.216
Now, everybody shut up! I gotta think.

01:32:34.774 --> 01:32:36.776
Shut up, everybody!

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.875
You. Yes, you.

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:52.800
Get up and get out of here,
and take your disabled mate with you.

01:32:52.792 --> 01:32:55.136
I can't fuckin' move.
I can't fuckin' walk.

01:32:55.128 --> 01:32:56.675
Don't make me fuckin' do it.

01:33:08.808 --> 01:33:11.652
And leave the fuckin' science teacher
and his missus alone.

01:33:15.064 --> 01:33:18.284
Arrggh!

01:33:19.611 --> 01:33:21.659
They're valuable fuckin' people to me.

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:29.997
You. Maximus.

01:33:43.635 --> 01:33:47.890
I'll be round tomorrow evening
to collect the deposit.

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:50.017
It's 10%.

01:33:50.016 --> 01:33:55.489
The rest of what you owe me
in two weeks' time. That's 90%.

01:33:58.107 --> 01:33:59.905
Work it out, genius.

01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:05.411
You've got a fair fuckin' idea
what'll happen if you don't have it.

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.535
And don't bother going to the cops.

01:34:08.534 --> 01:34:11.333
You won't live to regret it if you do.

01:34:19.837 --> 01:34:23.216
J' Finger on the fuckin' trigger
I'm a finger-fuckin' frigger... J'

01:34:23.216 --> 01:34:24.763
Fuckin' idiots.

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.853
See what we have to put up with?

01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:31.437
Wear earplugs or fuckin' move.

01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:41.826
I'll let you sort out
this little mess yourselves.

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:48.495
I'll leave you with a small reminder.

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:53.667
Go easy on him. No breaks,
not too much blood.

01:34:53.663 --> 01:34:56.041
He's a fuckin' wuss.

01:34:58.167 --> 01:34:59.919
See you tomorrow.

01:35:00.962 --> 01:35:04.842
And you can take those fuckin' stupid
pink gloves off now!

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:39.293
'If it were 25%, it'd be $37,500!'

01:35:42.879 --> 01:35:44.597
But it would.

01:35:44.589 --> 01:35:46.967
Oh, my brave baby!

01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:00.313
Fuck! Something's wrong here.

01:36:00.313 --> 01:36:03.943
Fuck!

01:36:03.941 --> 01:36:07.115
Oh, fuck!

01:36:08.446 --> 01:36:10.540
- King!
' King, King

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:12.078
King, it's OK.

01:36:13.159 --> 01:36:15.253
It's like I'm fuckin' dreamin', man!

01:36:15.244 --> 01:36:17.121
Nothin' makes sense!

01:36:17.121 --> 01:36:19.215
You're fine, King.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:21.551
You're gonna be just fine.

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:24.967
The money! I gotta get to the money.

01:36:28.091 --> 01:36:30.640
Get the ladder, Therese.
The King wants his money.

01:36:43.356 --> 01:36:46.075
I gotta keep it hidden from my mates.

01:36:46.067 --> 01:36:50.072
They keep on breaking windows
and stuff, trying to get it.

01:36:51.656 --> 01:36:53.784
It's not normal, is it?

01:36:53.783 --> 01:36:56.536
You know, you can't trust your mates.

01:36:56.536 --> 01:37:00.882
They keep on stealing from me
and beating me up.

01:37:00.873 --> 01:37:02.841
Is... is that normal?

01:37:04.419 --> 01:37:06.842
No, it's not, King. It's not.

01:37:08.339 --> 01:37:10.762
The only one I trust is you.

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:14.763
Me neighbours.
You've always been good to me.

01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:20.234
They've got problems, see?

01:37:21.686 --> 01:37:25.987
He's a schizophrenic and the
other one's been dropped on his head.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.738
They don't know I've got it.

01:37:31.737 --> 01:37:34.240
'Cause it's not really mine.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.787
And you can't let 'em have it.

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:38.662
They're comin' around for it tonight
and I've gotta have it!

01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:40.208
I've gotta have it.

01:37:40.204 --> 01:37:41.751
- It's OK, King.
- I'm sorry!

01:37:41.747 --> 01:37:44.216
- It's all right.
- I'm sorry.

01:37:44.208 --> 01:37:46.006
It's OK. It's all right.

01:37:46.002 --> 01:37:48.130
- It's all there.
- Thanks.

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:50.427
I'm sorry!

01:38:25.208 --> 01:38:27.461
What should we do with this?

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:31.297
Give it to King?

01:38:32.507 --> 01:38:34.475
Very funny.

01:38:34.467 --> 01:38:37.346
I'll return it.

01:38:58.783 --> 01:39:00.911
You continue to amaze me.

01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:04.338
Good.

01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:07.630
I wouldn't want you
to become bored by me.

01:39:12.964 --> 01:39:14.841
Ow.

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:19.057
- Ow.

01:39:49.125 --> 01:39:52.971
King! King!

01:39:52.962 --> 01:39:55.715
Any spaghetti left?
- No!

01:40:19.822 --> 01:40:21.745
What did you think of last night?

01:40:23.367 --> 01:40:25.290
Not much.

01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:32.259
Shall we?

01:40:33.919 --> 01:40:36.672
I guess we should.

01:40:48.017 --> 01:40:50.065
We're very sorry to see you go.

01:40:50.061 --> 01:40:52.564
We're very sorry to be leaving.

01:40:52.563 --> 01:40:55.407
I think next place,
we might call in

01:40:55.399 --> 01:40:57.743
on both sets of neighbours
before we buy.

01:40:58.778 --> 01:41:02.578
Oh, I don't know.
Exciting lives we folks lead.

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:23.804
Otto, better get that garlic frying.
Open inspection.

01:41:23.803 --> 01:41:26.977
I'm cooking, I'm cooking.
Adding a bit of rosemary and chilli.

01:41:26.972 --> 01:41:29.771
- Good luck, Denise.
- Fingers crossed.

01:41:29.767 --> 01:41:31.314
Yep.

01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:08.268
Hey, Mack! Hey, Trish!

01:42:08.264 --> 01:42:11.017
I'm sellin' up too!

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:14.858
Me sister died in hospital last week.

01:42:17.815 --> 01:42:19.738
Oh, that ten bucks I owe you?

01:42:19.734 --> 01:42:22.908
I'll give it back to you when the money
from the house comes through.

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:24.405
OK.

01:42:38.586 --> 01:42:41.806
Is it too late to void
the contract and stay?

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:46.052
Yep.

01:42:46.051 --> 01:42:47.598
Damn.

01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:51.350
Well, serves us right, I guess.

01:42:54.143 --> 01:42:56.396
Feel like
doing some renovating?

01:43:37.353 --> 01:43:41.529
