WEBVTT

00:00.099 --> 00:01.584
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.676 --> 00:03.105
Oh, my God, Kaitlin Cooper?

00:03.190 --> 00:05.034
So how long have you been in love with my sister?

00:05.116 --> 00:06.730
I don't have feelings for Johnny.

00:06.819 --> 00:08.663
- Last one in...
- Kaitlin!

00:08.779 --> 00:10.448
- I could really go for a drink.
- You read my mind.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.899
Actually, I was hoping that you might have dinner with me sometime.

00:12.984 --> 00:14.004
Neil, I would love to.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.392
You disrespected me, and the company I'm trying to build.

00:16.462 --> 00:19.530
That guy from Brown, he didn't say that they couldn't take more than one student.

00:19.611 --> 00:21.265
- This might be the year.
- That's right.

00:26.764 --> 00:29.175
Hey, baby, have you seen my lucky tie?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.702
I got it dry cleaned.

00:31.833 --> 00:34.414
Oh. You're an angel.

00:34.506 --> 00:35.194
Big day?

00:35.304 --> 00:39.127
Well, I got to sign some papers, make a few calls, build a hospital.

00:39.231 --> 00:40.432
Building a hospital, wow.

00:40.518 --> 00:44.184
Well, Caleb deserves most of the credit, I just inherited the project.

00:44.283 --> 00:45.349
So who's paying for it?

00:45.447 --> 00:47.477
The board of the Newport Laguna Medical Center.

00:47.621 --> 00:50.794
They commissioned a proposal from us and from a firm in Brea,

00:51.081 --> 00:52.316
and today we're both presenting.

00:52.413 --> 00:53.583
And they're going to pick you.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.556
Well, now that I got my lucky tie.

00:57.772 --> 00:59.181
- Hey.
- Hello. Hi.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.995
Are you okay? You seemed a little distracted last night.

01:03.092 --> 01:06.195
Uh, yeah, no, I'm fine.

01:06.641 --> 01:08.318
I don't think that convinced anyone.

01:08.831 --> 01:12.263
I was leaving school yesterday and Mrs. Rushfield said that some Brown rep called

01:12.338 --> 01:14.892
and wants to interview me on Sunday.

01:15.025 --> 01:17.600
That's great! Why didn't you say anything?

01:17.689 --> 01:20.263
I don't know, I guess it just needed to sink in.

01:20.743 --> 01:22.615
Did Summer get an interview?

01:23.040 --> 01:26.126
I forgot to ask, actually. I was just kind of spinning.

01:26.225 --> 01:28.925
Well, you want me to help you out, maybe uh, ask you a few questions?

01:29.026 --> 01:29.846
Yeah.

01:30.644 --> 01:33.826
Listen, Matt's waiting for me right now. But when I get back, let's talk.

01:33.922 --> 01:35.852
We'll practice, whatever you need.

01:35.944 --> 01:36.547
Yeah.

01:37.568 --> 01:38.337
I got to go.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.474
I better go, too-- Julie and I have a meeting with a new client.

01:41.557 --> 01:42.956
I am so proud of you.

01:43.037 --> 01:43.875
Thanks.

01:46.438 --> 01:47.384
Sure you're all right, man?

01:48.329 --> 01:49.464
Yeah, it's just kind of weird.

01:49.762 --> 01:54.090
It's like, there I am, I'm all ready to go, and I've got my watch set to East Coast time

01:54.159 --> 01:56.760
and then I get this interview, and it just kind of hit me.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.038
I'm leaving Newport.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.011
Well, so, you're having second thoughts.

02:00.099 --> 02:03.910
Dude, I planned my first escape on an Etch-A-Sketch. This is my dream.

02:04.031 --> 02:05.736
It's just, I don't know, now it's real.

02:06.039 --> 02:07.767
Well, why don't you talk to Summer about it?

02:07.849 --> 02:09.539
I mean, I'm sure she's freaking out a little bit, too.

02:09.616 --> 02:12.351
No, I'm fine. Seriously, this is just my process.

02:12.724 --> 02:15.445
Fair enough. You're pouring coffee in your cereal.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.063 --> 02:29.990
Newport, I hardly knew ya.

03:07.169 --> 03:08.766
Cohen! I got one!

03:09.056 --> 03:09.821
Hey, Summer.

03:09.894 --> 03:13.337
My interview with the Brown guy! Mrs. Rushfield just told me and that you got one, too!

03:13.420 --> 03:14.870
Oh, yeah, that's great.

03:14.968 --> 03:15.652
Great?

03:15.741 --> 03:18.551
Mrs. Rushfield said they only interview people that they're serious about.

03:18.637 --> 03:21.400
This like totally increases our chances of getting in together.

03:21.555 --> 03:22.621
Show some excitement!

03:22.719 --> 03:24.339
No, it's amazing. It's just...

03:24.806 --> 03:27.043
are you feeling any anxiety at all about this?

03:27.157 --> 03:27.928
About what?

03:28.030 --> 03:29.799
About leaving Newport and your friends and family

03:29.856 --> 03:32.048
and going somewhere completely new in September?

03:33.602 --> 03:35.079
Yeah, honestly, I was.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.194
- Really? 'Cause...
- But then I talked to Colonel Flynt.

03:37.266 --> 03:39.065
- Who's Colonel Flynt?
- He's my boot camp instructor.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.955
He's a former Delta. He says you can either ride change, or change rides you.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.708
And also, there's no room in the trenches of life for whiny little babies.

03:46.111 --> 03:47.333
Want to see my war face?

03:47.420 --> 03:48.743
That's not necessary.

03:48.846 --> 03:50.579
I got to go. But, um, it's not September.

03:50.653 --> 03:52.773
Freshman orientation starts August 25.

03:54.973 --> 03:55.999
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:59.567 --> 04:03.253
Situated as it is, the hospital will provide ready access to Newport's affluent

04:03.329 --> 04:06.242
and less affluent neighborhoods, servicing the whole community.

04:06.318 --> 04:08.875
There's more detailed budgets and schedules in your folders,

04:08.966 --> 04:11.460
along with copies of the permits that we pulled.

04:11.579 --> 04:13.604
We know you have another proposal to hear today.

04:13.708 --> 04:16.007
You should know we're ready to start any time.

04:16.105 --> 04:17.293
Just give us the green light.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.325
Well, speaking for all of us, you two have done a great job.

04:20.425 --> 04:22.095
I only wish Caleb could have been here.

04:22.198 --> 04:24.539
Thanks, Bill. This project was close to his heart.

04:24.643 --> 04:26.691
He did have one, as it turns out.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.896
We'll contact you as soon as we've made our decision.

04:32.938 --> 04:33.901
Now we wait.

04:36.318 --> 04:36.959
What?

04:39.401 --> 04:41.654
I took a look at Brea Group's plan this morning.

04:42.091 --> 04:45.389
I  didn't want to tell you, because I didn't want to spook you before a presentation.

04:45.482 --> 04:46.139
So?

04:46.391 --> 04:47.176
It's good.

04:47.398 --> 04:48.307
Better than ours?

04:48.437 --> 04:49.529
They're both excellent.

04:49.922 --> 04:54.488
But the Brea Group has been wining and dining Bill Merriam and the board for months.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.814
I mean, dinner, concerts, cruises.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.790
Well, we offered them bagels when they came in.

04:58.878 --> 05:00.353
I'm worried that we've handicapped ourselves.

05:00.432 --> 05:05.144
When I got into this, I said I wouldn't do business by plying people with meals and gifts.

05:05.234 --> 05:07.319
And I respect that. I do.

05:07.397 --> 05:10.676
But what it could all come down to is who Bill Merriam likes more.

05:10.917 --> 05:15.712
Well, hopefully he'll appreciate the fact that we appealed to his intelligence

05:15.820 --> 05:17.560
and not to his taste for pinot.

05:21.077 --> 05:22.830
Here's a picture with Kaitlin.

05:23.318 --> 05:25.617
But what's wrong with this horse?

05:25.706 --> 05:27.829
That's China. She has alopecia.

05:27.974 --> 05:30.200
Oh, she looks like a giant Chihuahua.

05:30.301 --> 05:31.353
Hey, what's up?

05:31.464 --> 05:35.741
Hey. So Kaitlin turns 15 this weekend and I'm putting together an album for her.

05:35.828 --> 05:36.845
Oh,  that's nice of you.

05:36.925 --> 05:40.528
Yeah, well, she hasn't been home for one since she was 12,

05:40.621 --> 05:42.034
so I've got a few to make up for.

05:42.117 --> 05:44.032
Well, as long as it comes with two carat diamond earrings,

05:44.107 --> 05:45.957
I'm sure little Kaitlin will be happy.

05:46.058 --> 05:49.419
My parents kind of went overboard on Kaitlin's birthdays when she was little.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.865
It always made Summer a little jealous.

05:52.168 --> 05:53.742
I need a coffee. Anyone else?

06:01.798 --> 06:02.453
What is it?

06:02.555 --> 06:04.610
It's just looking at these old photos.

06:04.992 --> 06:08.042
I mean, is this really the same girl who stole money from a fraternity

06:08.123 --> 06:10.746
and then lied about paying for an abortion?

06:11.199 --> 06:12.869
I feel like I don't even know her anymore.

06:12.992 --> 06:14.652
Well, families can be like that.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.879
People change on you.

06:17.021 --> 06:19.491
Maybe this is your chance to get to know the new Kaitlin.

06:19.577 --> 06:20.400
I guess.

06:21.344 --> 06:25.820
I mean, otherwise she goes back to school and I have to go to college and that's it.

06:27.641 --> 06:29.103
Cirque du Soleil?

06:29.204 --> 06:30.437
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

06:30.664 --> 06:33.755
Most people I know just had a clown at their birthday party.

06:33.865 --> 06:35.566
My mom went all out.

06:35.766 --> 06:38.772
We had presents, games, a petting zoo,

06:38.893 --> 06:41.503
and honestly the best part was always the after party.

06:41.992 --> 06:43.721
The whole family together.

06:44.909 --> 06:48.923
We'd stay up late and eat cake and watch The Sound of Music.

06:49.395 --> 06:50.255
Sing along.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.005
Oh, you mean, like, um...

06:54.075 --> 06:56.600
I'm 16, going on 17?

06:56.721 --> 07:00.975
Yeah, except however old I was turning, we'd always put in the ages.

07:01.084 --> 07:03.855
I guess as long as we still do that, the rest doesn't really matter.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.022
So have you told Marissa that we're hanging out?

07:09.515 --> 07:10.348
No.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.788
You're not going to tell her, are you?

07:13.610 --> 07:14.979
Not much chance to that.

07:15.594 --> 07:19.536
Now that she's at Harbor, I haven't even talked to her since your mom's party.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.930
You mean, since we had our midnight swim?

07:22.923 --> 07:25.628
You mean since you had your midnight swim and I got you a towel?

07:25.711 --> 07:27.708
Most guys would have taken advantage of me.

07:29.123 --> 07:30.659
Yeah, I guess I'm old-fashioned.

07:31.141 --> 07:32.503
That's  what I like about you.

07:34.596 --> 07:37.238
Let's talk about what you're going to get me for my birthday.

07:55.885 --> 07:59.950
Julie, I am so sorry to keep you waiting. A procedure ran long.

08:00.055 --> 08:02.610
Oh, no, no, it's fine, Neil. It's just...

08:03.362 --> 08:05.765
I have to pick up Marissa from school in a few minutes.

08:05.857 --> 08:06.766
Oh, no.

08:07.881 --> 08:10.108
Well, let's enjoy the time that we have.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.015
I'm just happy that we're finally meeting.

08:12.138 --> 08:16.004
After you postponed twice, I thought maybe you changed your mind.

08:16.113 --> 08:20.606
No, I just kept thinking about the fact that our daughters are best friends,

08:20.709 --> 08:23.919
I'm a recent widow, you're just out of a marriage.

08:25.223 --> 08:28.500
So what finally tipped the scale?

08:30.410 --> 08:31.558
I felt something.

08:34.273 --> 08:35.025
Me, too.

08:40.273 --> 08:43.047
I'm... I'm so sorry. I really have to go.

08:43.136 --> 08:44.261
No, no, no, I got this.

08:44.727 --> 08:46.363
Julie, how about dinner on Sunday night?

08:46.452 --> 08:49.266
I know this terrible burger joint, even the owner avoids it.

08:49.365 --> 08:50.527
We'll be totally alone.

08:52.519 --> 08:53.401
Sunday then.

08:57.564 --> 08:58.271
Hey.

09:01.065 --> 09:02.285
I came to see how you're doing.

09:02.388 --> 09:03.085
Hi, Dad.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.475
It's amazing to think that you'll be leaving in a few months.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.658
Yeah, and I'm freaking out.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.890
For years, I've been talking about how much I want to get out of here, and then,

09:12.562 --> 09:16.597
soon as it's time, I'm all like, "No, no, I'm not ready."

09:16.684 --> 09:18.466
No, what you're feeling is totally natural.

09:18.572 --> 09:19.508
I felt it.

09:20.807 --> 09:22.437
Leaving the Bronx for California?

09:23.802 --> 09:25.552
I was terrified about fitting in.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.616
I spent a month practicing how to say "dude."

09:29.351 --> 09:30.847
You still say it, kind of...

09:30.975 --> 09:33.388
Look, you're about to begin this great adventure

09:33.478 --> 09:35.447
and you have no idea what's going to happen.

09:35.538 --> 09:37.738
Yeah, I just don't really feel like it's the beginning of anything.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.904
I feel like more things are coming to an end.

09:40.002 --> 09:40.820
I'm sorry.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.209
It's the hospital board.

09:43.766 --> 09:46.111
Bill, how you doing?

09:48.135 --> 09:49.689
I'm going to go take a walk.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.839
Good idea. Clear your head. I'll talk to you when you get back.

09:53.212 --> 09:53.999
I'm sorry.

09:54.783 --> 09:57.767
So... are we building a hospital?

09:59.311 --> 10:00.996
Hey, Kaitlin?

10:01.546 --> 10:04.139
Anyone home? Me and Mom got takeout.

10:13.707 --> 10:16.432
Hey, sweetie. Did Marissa tell you we got Thai takeout?

10:16.512 --> 10:17.912
We're doing dinner à la Cohen.

10:18.133 --> 10:20.005
That sounds great. I love Thai.

10:20.099 --> 10:22.711
Oh, you know what? I also picked up a menu from this Armenian place.

10:22.795 --> 10:24.862
I thought you guys could order from there Sunday night.

10:25.044 --> 10:28.284
I have a business dinner. It's totally annoying.

10:28.510 --> 10:29.387
Sunday?

10:29.576 --> 10:32.205
Um, Mom, we've got plans Sunday, remember?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.374
What are you talking about? We don't have plans on Sunday.

10:34.463 --> 10:37.793
Yeah, we do. We were going to order in food, watch The Sound of Music.

10:37.917 --> 10:39.393
The Sound of Music? Why would...

10:44.841 --> 10:50.118
Oh, my God. Baby, I totally forgot. Sunday's your birthday.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.739
Yeah, but hey, if it's business, you can totally reschedule, right?

10:53.849 --> 10:54.870
I can totally reschedule.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.844
You know what? Why bother?

10:56.985 --> 10:57.702
Kaitlin.

10:57.818 --> 11:01.140
No, seriously. I hardly even remembered myself.

11:01.259 --> 11:04.143
I'm going to go meet a friend, because I'm not even hungry.

11:04.270 --> 11:05.377
Kaitlin, wait.

11:18.266 --> 11:21.042
Oh, Sandy, you want to tell the boys that dinner's almost ready?

11:21.369 --> 11:24.371
Well, sure, but Seth's taking a walk. He'll be back soon.

11:26.175 --> 11:26.831
What's wrong?

11:26.948 --> 11:30.151
Oh, Bill Merriam called. It looks like they're going with the group in Brea.

11:30.263 --> 11:31.813
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:32.581 --> 11:34.308
I just really wanted this project.

11:34.449 --> 11:36.456
Is it too late for a new approach?

11:36.564 --> 11:37.783
We took our shot.

11:38.233 --> 11:42.515
Plus, I don't want a contract if we have to get it by plying some guy with Kobe beef.

11:42.621 --> 11:46.021
If that's what you think would convince him, I think you're selling yourself short.

11:46.604 --> 11:47.557
What do you mean?

11:47.706 --> 11:52.181
I just know that when you wooed me, there was no caviar and champagne,

11:52.278 --> 11:53.681
and you did all right.

11:55.653 --> 12:00.628
I should take Bill Merriam out for pizza and bad wine in the back of a mail truck.

12:00.718 --> 12:04.905
I mean, show him who you are beyond schedules and budgets.

12:05.864 --> 12:08.333
And who knows, maybe he loves pizza.

12:18.140 --> 12:18.859
Hi.

12:20.934 --> 12:21.834
Kaitlin?

12:23.182 --> 12:24.228
What are you doing here?

12:26.194 --> 12:29.324
Are you... are you smoking pot?

12:29.528 --> 12:31.381
Yeah. Why? You a cop?

12:31.491 --> 12:34.213
No, but I... You know, I mean...

12:34.574 --> 12:37.667
Relax. Nobody here is gonna bust me.

12:39.060 --> 12:39.992
You want some?

12:40.137 --> 12:41.957
No, I'm okay. I'm good, thanks.

12:42.051 --> 12:46.250
You  sure? It helps take the edge off, and I could tell you could use it.

12:46.339 --> 12:48.349
Yeah, well, I was saving the whole drug thing for college.

12:48.442 --> 12:51.713
Plus, my dad smoked pot at Berkeley, so it...

12:52.072 --> 12:53.727
it's pretty much ruined for me.

12:54.761 --> 12:55.678
Where'd you get that?

12:55.800 --> 12:58.160
School. This girl grows it in her closet.

12:58.347 --> 12:59.692
What made you decide to, uh...?

12:59.797 --> 13:01.465
My mom forgot my birthday.

13:03.321 --> 13:04.063
Wow.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.592
Yeah. That whole time that I was gone,

13:07.696 --> 13:09.847
I kept telling myself that you're paranoid.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.748
They're not gonna forget about you.

13:12.182 --> 13:12.912
Wrong.

13:14.046 --> 13:17.328
Well, you know what? I'm sure your mom feels really bad.

13:17.418 --> 13:18.880
But that's not the point.

13:19.696 --> 13:24.054
Can you imagine growing up with Marissa Cooper as your older sister?

13:25.274 --> 13:29.805
My birthday was the one day I could count on people actually noticing me.

13:30.812 --> 13:31.744
Not anymore.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.009
Kaitlin!

13:33.866 --> 13:35.243
Please don't say anything.

13:35.417 --> 13:36.069
Yeah.

13:38.393 --> 13:39.640
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:39.791 --> 13:42.745
We just bumped into each other. Two ships passing.

13:42.946 --> 13:46.072
Um, come on. Please, can we go home now?

13:47.976 --> 13:49.643
Mom feels terrible.

13:50.899 --> 13:51.696
Fine.

13:52.620 --> 13:53.992
Bye. See ya.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.193
Offer stands.

13:56.859 --> 13:57.958
You know where to find me.

14:06.647 --> 14:08.359
Kaitlin, your phone!

14:17.029 --> 14:17.910
Johnny?

14:18.928 --> 14:20.686
Oh, Marissa, hey.

14:20.788 --> 14:23.396
Hey. Were you calling Kaitlin?

14:23.714 --> 14:26.934
No, I was calling you, um... but...

14:27.927 --> 14:31.679
your phone didn't ring, so I figured I'd give hers a try.

14:32.659 --> 14:33.517
What are you doing?

14:34.164 --> 14:36.526
Hey, it's Johnny. It's for me.

14:37.605 --> 14:38.329
Hey, what's up?

14:38.503 --> 14:41.094
You know, it just seemed like we hadn't talked for a while.

14:41.216 --> 14:42.227
I know.

14:42.473 --> 14:44.736
What are you doing tonight? 'Cause we were all gonna go out.

14:44.826 --> 14:49.128
Oh, uh, thanks, but... I'm gonna be with a friend.

14:49.998 --> 14:53.952
Um... Hey, listen, my mom needs me. Let me, uh, call you later?

14:54.060 --> 14:54.851
Okay.

14:55.158 --> 14:55.888
Bye.

14:57.081 --> 14:59.289
So anytime a guy calls, it's for you?

14:59.810 --> 15:01.024
What are you talking about?

15:01.140 --> 15:02.327
I mean, it was for me.

15:03.534 --> 15:04.465
Forget it.

15:06.936 --> 15:09.576
Look, Kaitlin, I know you're upset about last night, but...

15:09.680 --> 15:11.204
No more talking about it.

15:11.526 --> 15:13.253
Okay, well, um,

15:13.853 --> 15:16.768
we're all going out tonight to the Bait Shop, if you want to come.

15:17.033 --> 15:19.287
I  can't. I'm meeting friends.

15:20.604 --> 15:22.322
I'm going to go take a shower.

15:36.451 --> 15:37.172
Hello?

15:37.282 --> 15:39.716
So, how do you feel about going to the Bait Shop tonight?

15:41.505 --> 15:43.228
Julie.  What a surprise. Come in.

15:43.322 --> 15:45.536
Hi, Neil. Is Summer here?

15:45.683 --> 15:47.037
No, I think she's at Seth's.

15:47.131 --> 15:47.971
Oh, okay.

15:48.075 --> 15:52.069
Well, is there any chance that we could have dinner tonight instead of tomorrow night?

15:52.423 --> 15:55.239
Unfortunately, I'm working. You're not going to cancel on me, are you?

15:55.335 --> 15:58.985
Well, tomorrow's Kaitlin's birthday. I can't believe it slipped my mind.

15:59.141 --> 16:00.728
I'd like to give her a small party.

16:00.838 --> 16:03.298
I guess it'd have to be small. I live in a trailer.

16:03.565 --> 16:04.889
I hope you understand.

16:06.643 --> 16:07.831
Well, why don't you have it here?

16:07.939 --> 16:08.434
What?

16:08.559 --> 16:10.895
There's plenty of room. Girls can use the pool,

16:11.210 --> 16:12.632
and I get to see you.

16:12.942 --> 16:13.797
What do you say?

16:13.922 --> 16:15.784
- I say...
- Wonderful.

16:16.847 --> 16:20.609
Here is a key. You can let yourself in, do all the prep that you need.

16:20.703 --> 16:22.767
I've got a couple of minutes, why don't I give you a tour?

16:26.243 --> 16:28.759
All right, Summer, this one's for you.

16:28.855 --> 16:29.274
Ready?

16:29.374 --> 16:30.390
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- Okay.

16:30.819 --> 16:33.937
Who's been the greatest influence in your intellectual development?

16:34.049 --> 16:35.556
Um, Miuccia Prada.

16:36.353 --> 16:39.516
You probably want to say somebody more like Einstein, or...

16:39.616 --> 16:40.827
So, you want me to, like, lie?

16:40.931 --> 16:45.050
No, I just... I don't think that, uh, Prada is the answer that they're looking for.

16:45.158 --> 16:48.371
Well, this interview could, like, determine the rest of our lives, right?

16:48.525 --> 16:52.346
Well, if I say something that I don't believe in, I could end up with the wrong life.

16:52.442 --> 16:53.676
How awful would that be?

16:54.855 --> 16:55.751
She has a point.

16:56.431 --> 16:57.784
I have to go get a man and pedi.

16:58.951 --> 16:59.662
Summer.

16:59.862 --> 17:03.430
Cohen, if you want to memorize answers you think that they want to hear, that's fine,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.925
but I believe in being myself.

17:06.035 --> 17:08.922
And by the way, Miuccia Prada combines styles from time periods

17:09.003 --> 17:11.623
in ways people never even imagined possible.

17:11.837 --> 17:13.955
Her clothes teach you to change your perspective.

17:16.939 --> 17:17.989
I think she'll be fine.

17:18.273 --> 17:20.116
So where do you see yourself in ten years?

17:20.211 --> 17:23.770
Where do I see, uh, myself in ten years? That's a good question.

17:23.873 --> 17:27.851
Okay, uh, well, I guess more than anything, you know what I would like?

17:27.946 --> 17:30.405
I would like the happiness that I have right now.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.065
Although, I guess, what are the chances of that?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.677
I mean, you go through your life, and you're probably only going to be able

17:34.756 --> 17:36.915
to look back and pinpoint, like, two or three times

17:36.988 --> 17:39.063
where you were genuinely actually happy.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.580
And then, of course, in those moments, you wouldn't have even appreciated it anyways,

17:42.658 --> 17:47.306
because who does, right? So, where do I see myself in ten years?

17:47.405 --> 17:51.810
Um, I guess what I would like is, uh...

17:51.913 --> 17:53.475
I would like to be right here. You know what I mean?

17:53.557 --> 17:55.691
Right now, in this moment, and, uh,

17:55.784 --> 17:58.677
not because I'm afraid of uncertainty, because I'm not.

17:58.759 --> 18:03.394
It's just, you know, I was taught that when you have something good,

18:03.480 --> 18:06.737
what you're supposed to do is you hang on to it, you know?

18:06.839 --> 18:10.760
You hang on to it with both hands, and if somebody tries to take that from you,

18:10.848 --> 18:15.402
what you should do is you should make sure that they pry it from your cold, dead fingers.

18:15.914 --> 18:16.719
Yeah.

18:19.255 --> 18:21.169
- Let's take a break.
- Oh, God.

18:22.105 --> 18:23.114
I'll get you some water.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.882
Hey, I told you to stop coming in on Saturdays.

18:27.980 --> 18:28.963
Look who's talking.

18:29.246 --> 18:34.212
Hey, listen, give Bill Merriam a call and tell him we'd like to take him out tomorrow.

18:35.524 --> 18:37.107
This is a good idea.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.067
I know that they officially haven't given Brea the word yet,

18:39.147 --> 18:42.446
so what should I do, uh, set up a tee time? Reservation at the Arches?

18:42.530 --> 18:44.099
You ever eaten at El Pavo Loco?

18:44.189 --> 18:45.680
No. Is that a new restaurant?

18:45.769 --> 18:46.786
It's a burrito stand.

18:46.895 --> 18:50.046
I thought we'd take him on a walking tour of the neighborhoods around the hospital.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.143
You're kidding.

18:51.242 --> 18:54.072
The Brea Group's hospital is smack in an exclusive area.

18:54.171 --> 18:56.555
Ours would serve more people. I want to bring that home.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.230
Sandy.

18:57.352 --> 19:00.633
I know it's not how the rest of the world does business.

19:02.052 --> 19:02.866
Okay.

19:04.782 --> 19:08.676
I'll tell Bill Merriam that he'll have a day he'll never forget.

19:16.205 --> 19:16.853
Cheers.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.402
Cheers.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.808
How's it going with Kaitlin?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.780
Well, I mean, she was pretty upset.

19:25.952 --> 19:27.185
I invited her out.

19:34.072 --> 19:35.017
Kaitlin?

19:40.639 --> 19:44.033
Oh, my God, Marissa, I totally forgot you were going to be here.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.923
Hey. Well, what are you two doing?

19:48.168 --> 19:49.919
We're just hanging out.

19:50.082 --> 19:51.361
So don't freak out or anything.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.436
Yeah, we probably should have mentioned it.

19:54.562 --> 19:57.139
So, you two are just hanging out?

19:57.227 --> 19:59.797
Well, yeah. He took me home from the party, remember?

19:59.901 --> 20:02.507
And then we had a chance to talk, went for a swim.

20:02.845 --> 20:03.485
Actually, uh...

20:03.586 --> 20:05.927
Oh, so I asked you to drive my little sister home,

20:06.005 --> 20:07.671
and you guys went for a midnight swim?

20:07.770 --> 20:09.887
No. Look, I just got her a towel.

20:11.635 --> 20:14.523
Who were you really calling this morning, me or her?

20:15.598 --> 20:18.075
Look, I knew she was going to freak out like this.

20:22.223 --> 20:24.838
I'm not freaking out. I just don't like being lied to.

20:24.939 --> 20:25.794
Whatever.

20:26.969 --> 20:29.205
Can you take me home? I don't feel very well.

20:31.868 --> 20:32.741
I'm sorry.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.545
You all right?

20:38.117 --> 20:39.243
Yeah, I just...

20:39.586 --> 20:41.364
I don't see why they couldn't tell me the truth.

20:51.235 --> 20:54.295
Come on, watching Marissa get jealous?

20:54.471 --> 20:55.731
Admit it felt good.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.303
She wasn't jealous.

20:57.481 --> 20:59.389
She was so jealous.

20:59.712 --> 21:01.493
Seeing us together...

21:01.629 --> 21:03.299
Kaitlin, I'm not sure about this.

21:03.403 --> 21:06.107
But... I thought you liked me.

21:06.423 --> 21:09.082
I do... but...

21:09.544 --> 21:13.929
Okay, look, even if you weren't Marissa's sister, I'm 17, you're 14.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.047
15 tomorrow.

21:15.182 --> 21:15.975
Still.

21:17.813 --> 21:18.560
Fine.

21:19.382 --> 21:20.367
I get it.

21:21.407 --> 21:22.226
No, look.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.213
I want to keep hanging out,

21:25.603 --> 21:28.790
but as friends, okay?

21:29.509 --> 21:31.057
It'll make Marissa mad.

21:32.529 --> 21:33.722
I can live with that.

21:49.527 --> 21:50.158
Hey.

21:50.738 --> 21:51.691
Oh, my God.

21:51.872 --> 21:55.562
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I know it seems weird. 

21:56.234 --> 21:58.255
Me loitering in the shadows...

21:58.370 --> 21:59.453
It's okay.

22:01.977 --> 22:03.999
I had a feeling you'd come around.

22:13.156 --> 22:14.651
Hey, top of the morning.

22:14.766 --> 22:15.663
Hey.

22:16.255 --> 22:17.701
So today's the day, huh?

22:17.803 --> 22:19.810
Yeah. Interview's not till this afternoon.

22:19.907 --> 22:21.654
Well, your mother's making pancakes.

22:21.787 --> 22:22.485
Come on down.

22:22.584 --> 22:25.879
You know, I already ate, plus I just want to... kind of go over some of this stuff.

22:25.982 --> 22:28.727
At a certain point, cramming becomes counterproductive.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.495
Do something to relax.

22:30.735 --> 22:32.189
I was thinking that myself.

22:32.298 --> 22:33.418
You're going to do great.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.618
Happy birthday.

23:11.290 --> 23:15.191
Look, Kaitlin, I know you think I overreacted or whatever,

23:15.282 --> 23:20.625
but, I mean, Johnny's just a lot older than you, and I don't want to see you get hurt.

23:20.718 --> 23:21.875
Oh, please.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.120
Like that's really why you got mad.

23:24.454 --> 23:26.310
What's that supposed to mean?

23:28.817 --> 23:29.685
Hey.

23:31.087 --> 23:32.258
Look at that.

23:33.130 --> 23:37.581
My two little girls-- or should I say, two young women.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.344
Happy birthday, sweetie.

23:40.991 --> 23:42.841
Oh, gross, Mom, you're all sweaty.

23:42.947 --> 23:45.550
Oh, I know, I'm sorry. I was running.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.589
You know, after years of doing cardio bar and yogilates,

23:48.688 --> 23:51.110
I forgot how good this feels; I got three honks.

23:51.199 --> 23:52.064
That's great, Mom.

23:52.174 --> 23:55.262
Okay, so tonight? Not only have I planned an amazing dinner,

23:55.341 --> 23:57.754
but Dr. Roberts said that we could have it at his house.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.177
Whoa, Dr. Roberts offered you his house?

24:00.280 --> 24:03.768
Yeah, well, I ran into him yesterday, and I mentioned that it was Kaitlin's birthday,

24:03.853 --> 24:06.995
and, voilà, he couldn't take no for an answer.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.551
He's so generous.

24:08.701 --> 24:10.775
Whoever gets him is a very lucky woman.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.509
You know I don't want a birthday dinner.

24:13.232 --> 24:14.432
What are you talking about?

24:14.557 --> 24:16.835
He even said that we could watch the Sound of Music on his plasma.

24:16.932 --> 24:18.061
Maybe next year.

24:18.349 --> 24:23.079
Oh, honey, I am so sorry that I forgot your birthday.

24:23.458 --> 24:26.690
Ever since Caleb's death, things have been a little crazy.

24:27.673 --> 24:29.215
But we really need this.

24:29.321 --> 24:30.395
As a family.

24:31.499 --> 24:32.399
Please?

24:34.705 --> 24:36.443
Only if I can invite a friend.

24:36.539 --> 24:37.368
No.

24:38.065 --> 24:41.135
I mean, isn't it better if it's just our family and the Roberts'?

24:41.288 --> 24:44.064
Well, it's Kaitlin's birthday, she can have whoever she wants.

24:44.185 --> 24:47.181
Oh, maybe we should invite your old friends from the Equestrian Club.

24:47.285 --> 24:48.266
Sure.

24:48.702 --> 24:49.792
Sounds great.

24:49.986 --> 24:51.138
- Bye.
- Okay, bye, honey.

24:55.006 --> 24:57.330
Oh, Marissa, I'm going to need you to help me set up.

24:58.034 --> 25:00.347
Please, I need to make this up to Kaitlin.

25:00.947 --> 25:01.807
Fine.

25:01.966 --> 25:02.893
Okay, thanks.

25:03.041 --> 25:04.850
Oh, sorry about the sweat.

25:06.203 --> 25:11.047
I am 16, going on 17...

25:13.265 --> 25:14.282
Knock, knock.

25:15.151 --> 25:15.812
Hi.

25:17.596 --> 25:19.198
Hmm. You and Marissa.

25:19.666 --> 25:21.206
Looks like the perfect couple.

25:21.367 --> 25:23.596
You know, people used to say that about her and Luke.

25:25.596 --> 25:26.602
Life's weird, huh?

25:26.707 --> 25:27.996
Yeah. What's up?

25:28.752 --> 25:30.263
I need your advice.

25:30.460 --> 25:32.629
My mom's throwing a party for me tonight.

25:32.868 --> 25:34.335
Of course you're invited.

25:34.527 --> 25:37.812
But do you think that Marissa would mind if I invited Johnny?

25:37.903 --> 25:39.317
No, why would she mind?

25:39.420 --> 25:43.128
Well, she seemed a little weird when she saw us together last night.

25:43.694 --> 25:46.591
But they're just friends, so why would it matter if we're hanging out--

25:46.678 --> 25:48.487
if they're just friends?

25:48.769 --> 25:50.605
Kaitlin, what are you trying to do?

25:50.731 --> 25:53.234
Just make everybody happy, I told you.

25:53.325 --> 25:55.728
Because it seems like you're mad at Marissa, and you're...

25:55.882 --> 25:57.835
I don't know, you're looking for a way to hurt her.

25:57.993 --> 25:59.592
What are you talking about?

25:59.773 --> 26:01.654
Marissa's my sister and I love her.

26:01.753 --> 26:05.291
Then why don't you talk to her instead of trying to stir something up?

26:07.768 --> 26:09.820
You know, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

26:09.922 --> 26:12.579
But Johnny's my friend, and I want him at my party.

26:12.736 --> 26:15.203
It's just that look on her face when she saw us together.

26:15.299 --> 26:17.329
But I don't have to tell you about that, do I?

26:18.139 --> 26:19.196
See you tonight.

26:21.148 --> 26:23.327
Thank you so much for your help, Kiki.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.035
God knows I have my talents, cooking is not one of them.

26:26.122 --> 26:28.475
Well, it was nice of Neil to lend you his house.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.171
Yes, he is a gentleman.

26:30.267 --> 26:31.149
Is he?

26:31.807 --> 26:33.302
Kirsten, please.

26:34.048 --> 26:36.889
We've hardly had a real date. We haven't even kissed.

26:36.972 --> 26:39.265
But he offered his house for Kaitlin's birthday.

26:39.350 --> 26:40.539
I'd say that's a good sign.

26:40.626 --> 26:41.999
It is a beautiful house.

26:42.117 --> 26:44.998
Although I was thinking you could change out the marble in the entrance hall,

26:45.077 --> 26:46.913
- and some of the furniture...
- Julie?

26:47.331 --> 26:50.490
Since you haven't kissed yet, you might want to hold off on the redecorating.

26:50.797 --> 26:54.021
Oh, yeah. Just making conversation.

26:54.703 --> 26:55.863
Should I take this out?

26:55.964 --> 26:56.901
Yeah. Please.

27:12.656 --> 27:13.363
Great, thank you.

27:14.220 --> 27:15.211
Here you go.

27:15.716 --> 27:17.276
Newport's finest churro.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.656
Thanks, Sandy.

27:19.231 --> 27:21.270
I don't remember the last time I walked this much.

27:21.376 --> 27:24.395
Well, the hospital would service a wide variety of neighborhoods.

27:24.473 --> 27:26.090
I wanted you to get a sense of that.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.206
Mission accomplished.

27:27.305 --> 27:29.340
And I told you how the free clinic might operate?

27:29.441 --> 27:32.695
Twice. But if you don't mind, I think I need a little break from the hospital.

27:36.799 --> 27:38.955
All right, we're losing him.

27:39.121 --> 27:40.404
Let's do it your way.

27:41.289 --> 27:42.122
Yeah? You sure?

27:42.203 --> 27:44.966
The truth is, the tour worked more on me than it did on him.

27:45.088 --> 27:47.619
I'm not going to rob this community of something it needs just...

27:48.570 --> 27:50.472
just so I can sleep easier.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.357
So come on.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.656
Bill?

27:53.454 --> 27:55.702
It's almost dinner time. Where would you like to go?

28:03.219 --> 28:04.987
Marissa, you should come in.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.264
The water's great.

28:06.446 --> 28:09.215
Yeah, I'd love to, but I'm helping set up for your party.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.474
And I'm so grateful.

28:13.328 --> 28:15.722
Marissa? Kaitlin? Look who's here.

28:15.846 --> 28:17.020
Hi, Dr. Roberts.

28:17.125 --> 28:17.962
Hey, Marissa.

28:18.070 --> 28:18.799
Kaitlin?

28:18.934 --> 28:22.439
Don't you think you should say thank you for Dr. Robert's hospitality?

28:22.614 --> 28:26.563
Oh. Thank you so much for letting me use your house for my party.

28:26.662 --> 28:27.818
You are so welcome.

28:27.933 --> 28:30.066
Johnny! You came!

28:30.609 --> 28:32.842
Oh... my little girl is growing up.

28:32.983 --> 28:34.900
And she wants everyone to see it, too.

28:35.285 --> 28:36.986
Mom, this is Johnny.

28:37.075 --> 28:39.906
Of course. This is Dr. Roberts. This is his house.

28:40.144 --> 28:41.004
Hey, Johnny.

28:41.102 --> 28:42.214
Nice to meet you.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.550
Hey, Marissa.

28:43.672 --> 28:44.194
Hi.

28:44.295 --> 28:47.246
Oh, look, I got you all wet. I'm sorry.

28:47.437 --> 28:50.725
I'm going to go see if Kirsten needs help.

28:58.991 --> 29:00.871
- Seth?
- Yes?

29:00.954 --> 29:02.233
- Hey, man.
- Yes.

29:02.978 --> 29:05.473
Com... geez, man, I'm coming.

29:05.574 --> 29:06.677
Something's blocking the door.

29:06.771 --> 29:07.784
Okay!

29:08.202 --> 29:09.809
Just calm down.

29:10.562 --> 29:12.356
"I got to get in right now."

29:12.847 --> 29:13.825
Coming.

29:14.109 --> 29:14.934
I've got...

29:16.094 --> 29:17.426
to do something real...

29:18.548 --> 29:19.605
Yeah, that's perfect.

29:22.608 --> 29:23.969
- Seth?
- Okay.

29:25.107 --> 29:26.705
God. Listen, hey, man.

29:26.811 --> 29:30.690
I'm sorry, there was a... There was a laundry build up right there.

29:30.920 --> 29:31.758
Geez.

29:31.874 --> 29:35.619
It's almost 3:30, isn't your interview at 4:00?

29:35.712 --> 29:37.232
What are you talking about?

29:38.276 --> 29:40.248
Hey, how'd that happen?

29:40.369 --> 29:41.247
Well, are you ready?

29:41.355 --> 29:42.520
Am I ready?

29:42.809 --> 29:46.168
Do me a favor. Go ahead and feel that.

29:46.288 --> 29:48.156
- Feel that puppy right there.
- No, dude, no.

29:48.253 --> 29:51.138
Okay, you don't want to touch another man, I get it.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.227
I get it.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.491
You find my slender swimmer's body, um... intimidating.

29:55.587 --> 29:56.406
Something smells.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.338
No, it doesn't.

29:57.426 --> 30:02.299
No, it doesn't, but they say the first sign of, um, a brain tumor,

30:02.403 --> 30:05.197
is a phantom smell, so you should lay down.

30:05.283 --> 30:07.304
Hey. Hey.

30:07.934 --> 30:10.355
You've solved it. You've figured it out. That's...

30:10.467 --> 30:13.439
You're a mystery solver. You're like Encyclopedia Brown.

30:13.548 --> 30:17.602
Remember... when Encyclopedia Brown, he went on down to Texas

30:17.696 --> 30:20.599
to solve the mystery of the Great Shootout?

30:20.695 --> 30:22.464
Hey, how about this for a change?

30:22.612 --> 30:24.755
How about in a cage match:

30:24.870 --> 30:31.323
Encyclopedia Brown versus The Great Brain... to the death.

30:34.110 --> 30:35.217
Are you high?

30:39.550 --> 30:41.056
Am I high?

30:41.362 --> 30:43.676
No! No, come on, man.

30:43.762 --> 30:45.201
I love when you go for the comedy.

30:45.317 --> 30:49.408
But I would not quit your day job beating up, uh, people.

30:50.519 --> 30:51.370
I wouldn't.

30:55.417 --> 30:56.995
I don't know how that got there.

31:04.812 --> 31:05.498
Hello?

31:05.591 --> 31:06.765
Hey, Summer.

31:06.870 --> 31:07.928
Are you at the interview yet?

31:08.018 --> 31:10.179
Um, yeah, I'm about to go in.

31:10.263 --> 31:11.742
Can you stretch yours out a little bit?

31:11.836 --> 31:13.352
Seth's going to be late.

31:13.771 --> 31:14.932
Sure. What happened?

31:15.025 --> 31:16.664
I just need to bring him down to earth a little.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.077
We'll be there soon as we can, okay?

31:18.173 --> 31:19.653
Okay. Bye.

31:21.152 --> 31:22.075
Seth?

31:22.186 --> 31:23.177
Hey, man.

31:23.297 --> 31:25.457
Got some coffee for you. I want you to drink it, okay?

31:25.546 --> 31:27.671
Dude, I am not stoned anymore.

31:27.767 --> 31:29.824
Okay, then, uh, why are you in my shower?

31:31.254 --> 31:32.083
Whoa.

31:32.465 --> 31:33.283
How'd that happen?

31:33.374 --> 31:34.513
Just drink the coffee.

31:35.142 --> 31:38.891
Dude, all right, I'm fine. The guy's going to think I'm Rupert the Monkey Boy.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.133
How long you been doing this, man?

31:40.262 --> 31:41.826
Oh, God, it's pot.

31:42.013 --> 31:43.894
Aren't you overreacting a little bit?

31:43.987 --> 31:46.355
You were doing it alone and in secret. It's a little bit different.

31:46.454 --> 31:48.385
Well, this is the first time, I swear.

31:48.482 --> 31:50.305
And this is really just stress about the leaving?

31:50.581 --> 31:53.966
Two years ago this miracle happened to me, okay?

31:54.036 --> 31:57.554
You showed up and Summer started talking to me, and my life changed.

31:57.792 --> 32:00.125
And I'd be leaving that for someplace new.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.863
And it'd just be real easy for things to go back to the way they were,

32:02.958 --> 32:03.807
and I just can't do that.

32:03.908 --> 32:05.704
Well, it wasn't a miracle. You're the one who got up on that coffee cart

32:05.797 --> 32:07.498
and told Summer you loved her.

32:07.633 --> 32:10.256
You've changed, you know? You're going to be fine, wherever you go.

32:10.865 --> 32:13.741
Now tell me you weren't stupid enough to buy the pot down at the pier.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.937
Cause you know half those guys are narcs, right?

32:16.039 --> 32:18.365
No, it was nothing like that. Uh...

32:18.497 --> 32:22.474
Hey, don't get her in trouble with Marissa, but actually, I got it from Kaitlin.

32:22.563 --> 32:23.597
Thank God.

32:23.927 --> 32:26.638
You guys, do you realize I have been in there for an hour and a half?

32:26.729 --> 32:28.012
What took you so long?

32:28.123 --> 32:29.279
He just needed to calm down.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.416
Why don't you head on in and just meet us at Summer's when you're done?

32:32.514 --> 32:33.373
Oh, okay.

32:33.624 --> 32:37.203
Yeah, no pressure. But if you mess it up, our future together is ruined.

33:16.159 --> 33:16.847
Hey.

33:17.085 --> 33:19.317
People I know. Hi.

33:19.847 --> 33:22.857
After Kirsten left, I had no one to talk to.

33:23.444 --> 33:24.853
This is a good turnout though.

33:24.957 --> 33:27.850
Yeah, well, my mom invited Kaitlin's old riding club.

33:27.948 --> 33:29.424
She probably shouldn't have bothered.

33:29.527 --> 33:30.319
Summer.

33:30.452 --> 33:32.051
Oh, excuse me, you guys.

33:34.426 --> 33:35.932
Hey, sweetheart, how'd your interview go?

33:36.828 --> 33:38.018
Everything all right?

33:40.974 --> 33:44.530
Yeah, well, remember when I said I wanted to get to know Kaitlin?

33:45.164 --> 33:46.649
Be careful what you wish for.

33:48.184 --> 33:51.542
In that case, there's something I should tell you about her and Seth.

34:00.479 --> 34:02.299
What are we doing here?

34:02.985 --> 34:04.049
I told you.

34:04.472 --> 34:05.858
Looking for my presents.

34:05.958 --> 34:08.059
Your presents are all downstairs.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.484
Not all of them.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.588
Kaitlin, look, I told you...

34:10.697 --> 34:12.876
That you're 17, and that I'm 14.

34:12.995 --> 34:16.132
But I'm not 14 anymore, remember?

34:16.701 --> 34:19.050
Okay, but look, someone could come in. We should just...

34:19.129 --> 34:20.418
You want to lock the door?

34:20.737 --> 34:22.453
What are you planning on doing to me?

34:22.755 --> 34:23.746
Very funny.

34:23.847 --> 34:26.268
Or is it that you're afraid that Marissa will come in?

34:26.387 --> 34:30.260
She sees you with her little sister, and then you really don't have a chance.

34:30.366 --> 34:30.978
What are you talking about?

34:31.034 --> 34:33.766
Look, you said that you liked me.

34:33.888 --> 34:35.724
Now we're only two years apart.

34:35.887 --> 34:38.114
So unless there's something else...

34:39.302 --> 34:41.106
I'm not interested in Marissa, all right?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.342
Then prove it.

34:42.509 --> 34:44.897
One birthday kiss.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.469
You know, I think we better get back to the party.

35:00.956 --> 35:03.201
You can't stop me. I let this go far enough as it is.

35:03.289 --> 35:05.423
Marissa, look, I know you need to talk to her, but...

35:05.614 --> 35:07.329
Come on, it's your sister. It's still her birthday party.

35:07.422 --> 35:08.998
Hey! I'm back!

35:09.100 --> 35:13.110
From my interview for Brown, which I went to.

35:13.199 --> 35:14.057
Okay.

35:16.013 --> 35:19.348
You told her, didn't you? Okay, first of all, don't blame Kaitlin.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.853
Fat chance of that.

35:20.971 --> 35:22.034
Where have you been?

35:22.136 --> 35:24.282
Oh, Johnny gave me my present.

35:29.793 --> 35:30.797
Shh.

35:40.933 --> 35:44.421
So, looks like Lily and Bill are hitting it off.

35:44.993 --> 35:47.946
Yeah, I balked at taking him out to dinner, but

35:48.081 --> 35:51.587
I'm totally cool about turning your apartment into the Playboy Grotto.

35:51.968 --> 35:54.043
Bill, here you go.

35:54.248 --> 35:55.062
Thanks, Sandy.

35:55.172 --> 35:56.703
Dry martini for you, Lily.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.191
I've got to tell you, I'm glad I didn't go home.

35:59.288 --> 36:00.016
So am I.

36:00.111 --> 36:02.624
Well, this may not seem fair, but I think I'm going to have to

36:02.682 --> 36:04.423
talk to you a little bit more about the hospital.

36:04.523 --> 36:06.044
Sandy, that won't be necessary.

36:06.730 --> 36:08.566
Excuse me, please.

36:11.087 --> 36:11.950
I'm in.

36:12.862 --> 36:13.478
You're in?

36:13.587 --> 36:16.286
Honestly, I didn't see the difference between the proposals.

36:16.548 --> 36:19.634
You're trying to take care of me. The least I can do is take care of you.

36:19.739 --> 36:21.472
I mean, that's business, right?

36:22.609 --> 36:23.991
Caleb would have been proud.

36:25.245 --> 36:26.447
A martini...

36:26.975 --> 36:29.492
and scotch for the lady.

36:31.129 --> 36:32.205
So what he say?

36:32.326 --> 36:33.753
We got the hospital.

36:34.264 --> 36:35.692
- Really?
- Really.

36:35.804 --> 36:37.644
Sandy, that's amazing.

36:45.519 --> 36:46.953
Where are you going?

36:47.070 --> 36:48.925
Leaving. Would you tell Mom?

36:49.033 --> 36:51.360
You're leaving your own birthday party?

36:52.654 --> 36:54.473
I need to talk to my sister.

36:54.635 --> 36:55.219
Listen, Marissa...

36:55.328 --> 36:57.839
Look, I really don't feel like hearing it right now.

37:00.316 --> 37:01.623
What's wrong with you?

37:01.734 --> 37:02.923
Here we go.

37:03.034 --> 37:04.885
Kaitlin, you gave Seth pot.

37:04.995 --> 37:06.835
You stole money from a fraternity.

37:06.929 --> 37:08.287
I don't even know who you are anymore.

37:08.381 --> 37:10.438
Do you want to just spare me the concerned sister bit?

37:10.545 --> 37:12.611
We both know this is about Johnny.

37:13.226 --> 37:14.621
You don't know what you're talking about.

37:14.715 --> 37:17.024
Look, Marissa, anyone can tell that you like him.

37:17.128 --> 37:18.699
You don't think Ryan can?

37:19.567 --> 37:21.771
- I love Ryan.
- Yeah, you love Ryan.

37:21.852 --> 37:24.184
You guys are soul mates, blah, blah, blah.

37:24.295 --> 37:26.423
It doesn't mean that you don't like Johnny.

37:28.018 --> 37:29.955
- I don't.
- Really?

37:30.383 --> 37:33.978
Well, then you wouldn't mind that I just made out with him upstairs.

37:35.182 --> 37:36.082
Yeah.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.799
You may not know me, but I do know you.

37:54.819 --> 37:56.372
Hi. There you are. You all right?

37:56.466 --> 37:57.943
No. It's Kaitlin.

37:58.050 --> 38:00.944
Hey, Marissa, honey. Where's Kaitlin? It's time for the cake.

38:01.285 --> 38:02.994
- She's gone.
- What?

38:03.318 --> 38:05.271
What do you mean she's gone? Of course she's not gone.

38:05.357 --> 38:07.995
I mean, she wouldn't just leave her own party?

38:08.087 --> 38:10.165
Yeah, well, we got into a fight.

38:10.629 --> 38:13.113
You got in a fight at her birthday party? What about?

38:13.215 --> 38:14.885
I don't want to go into it, okay?

38:14.971 --> 38:17.188
How could you do this to your little sister, Marissa?

38:17.363 --> 38:20.233
Do you even know what's she's been through being away for so long?

38:20.331 --> 38:23.049
This was a very important birthday for her. For all of us.

38:23.141 --> 38:26.786
Look, Mom, no offense, but I don't think a party is really going to fix this family.

38:27.266 --> 38:28.477
Excuse me?

38:31.265 --> 38:33.871
You know what, I should just go. Okay, I'm sorry.

38:34.157 --> 38:35.405
Bye, Dr. Roberts.

38:35.508 --> 38:36.016
I'll take you home?

38:36.112 --> 38:39.618
No, I... I want to walk. I need the fresh air.

38:56.718 --> 38:58.148
I don't know what to say, Neil.

38:58.246 --> 39:00.005
It's fine, Julie, it's fine.

39:00.397 --> 39:02.557
- You know, I just wonder...
- Oh, no.

39:02.650 --> 39:04.388
No, I think that you were right to be cautious.

39:04.477 --> 39:05.961
We both have very complex lives,

39:06.039 --> 39:10.720
and maybe we should consider all of the implications before going further.

39:12.964 --> 39:15.623
I'm sorry, it's one of my nurses. They said they'd beep me if I was needed.

39:15.706 --> 39:19.531
- I hate to leave you like this.
- Oh. No, it's fine.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.965
I'll just give these kids some cake and send them home. And...

39:23.940 --> 39:26.576
You're right about the other thing, I completely agree.

39:26.814 --> 39:28.141
So we'll talk.

39:29.380 --> 39:33.182
And you can leave the key on the dish when you leave, all right?

39:40.766 --> 39:41.639
Come in.

39:43.553 --> 39:47.048
Hi, Cohen. I'm looking to see if Brown has a course in human sexuality.

39:47.142 --> 39:49.013
Because no offense, you are so taking that.

39:51.113 --> 39:52.571
- Summer...
- Hmm?

39:53.397 --> 39:55.932
Oh, my God, I'm such an airhead. How did it go?

39:56.037 --> 39:58.230
Please tell me it went okay, please?

40:02.190 --> 40:03.373
It went great.

40:03.919 --> 40:05.038
We totally bonded.

40:05.135 --> 40:08.352
That is amazing. This means we're going to be together next year.

40:08.981 --> 40:10.791
Come here, let's pick out our schedule.

40:10.907 --> 40:11.679
Okay.

40:14.276 --> 40:15.156
Where's the rest of it?

40:15.275 --> 40:17.192
Oh, I threw away the boring courses.

40:17.310 --> 40:20.535
You know, like history, English, health, science.

40:20.638 --> 40:21.867
That was probably a good idea.

40:28.692 --> 40:29.750
Oh, hey.

40:30.269 --> 40:31.389
When'd you get home?

40:31.634 --> 40:33.038
Just a few minutes ago.

40:33.634 --> 40:35.144
I thought you might be sleeping.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.576
No, I waited up.

40:36.695 --> 40:37.528
How'd it go?

40:37.640 --> 40:39.172
Well, we made our case...

40:41.081 --> 40:42.057
and we got it.

40:42.630 --> 40:44.316
Sandy, that's wonderful.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.181
And you did it your way.

40:46.887 --> 40:47.801
Yeah.

40:48.541 --> 40:49.490
When are you coming to bed?

40:49.588 --> 40:53.381
Soon. Bill Merriam is coming by tomorrow, and I thought I should prep a little.

40:54.049 --> 40:55.748
Well, I'm very proud of you.
