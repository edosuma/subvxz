00:01.200 --> 00:03.080
'Previously...'
How's your hand?

00:03.080 --> 00:07.080
Perfect. No strength.
Couldn't crush an Oreo.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.840
Look, Ellen.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.880
You have been
underfoot all week.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.800
This temporary
premature retirement

00:13.800 --> 00:16.560
is harder on me
than you.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.480
Do something better
with your convalescence.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.440
A memoir,
by Dr Mark Craig.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.160
You're a piece of work -

00:23.160 --> 00:26.000
taking a stand
until things get hot.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Next Time you screw up,
don't involve me.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.800
BEEPER

02:44.800 --> 02:48.800
Rats.
I just sat down.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.520
BEEPER

02:55.520 --> 02:59.520
Raisin d'etre.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.760
BEEPER

03:07.520 --> 03:11.520
Coming. I'm coming.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.720
Code blue.
Room 3162

03:22.720 --> 03:26.720
3162.

03:28.920 --> 03:29.880
3162?

03:29.880 --> 03:32.760
I knew
he'd crap out.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.080
You have
to be quicker.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.960
We did our best.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.960
Arriving after me
is too late.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.240
He's still
in v-tach.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.120
Lydocaine.
100 milligrams, I.V.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.520
We wouldn't be
losing him

03:47.520 --> 03:50.880
if one of you
hadn't mismanaged things.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.320
We've watched him.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.760
Who was here last?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.680
Loyalty.
Good to see.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.480
Get out!

04:00.480 --> 04:04.480
Out!

04:06.400 --> 04:07.280
Damn.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.800
Congratulations, Birch.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.800
Your first murder.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.920
KNOCK ON DOOR

04:16.920 --> 04:19.320
Sorry to
keep you waiting.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.240
Take your brother
and sister out.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.680
All right, Mom.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.080
Bye, Tim.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.000
Bye. Keep that
finger out of
gooberville.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.960
Whatever you
gave me took
the pain away.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.480
Need anything else?

04:33.480 --> 04:36.280
To be rowing
in Sebago Lake.

04:36.280 --> 04:39.640
It's the
first summer
we haven't gone.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.960
Next year, Timmy.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.480
Why can't
Timmy go back
on dialysis?

04:44.480 --> 04:46.040
Mom, I said...

04:46.040 --> 04:47.960
I tried to explain,

04:47.960 --> 04:50.840
at this point
in his disease,

04:50.840 --> 04:52.600
dialysis wouldn't
be effective.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.600
Let's go outside.

04:57.040 --> 05:01.040
I heard a good one.
I'll tell you later.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.080
OK.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.280
Latest tests show
Tim's status unchanged.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.160
There must
be something.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.080
A transplant?
The dialysis?

05:12.080 --> 05:14.120
Enough about
the dialysis.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.880
We have to face
the inevitable.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.960
We're down to days.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.400
You're the doctor.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.680
Do something!

05:21.680 --> 05:25.040
The tumour's growing
despite chemotherapy
and surgery.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.320
I would try
any alternative.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.160
I'm telling you,
I'm his mother,

05:30.160 --> 05:32.560
and I won't
give up.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.000
Right, James?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.400
Put Tim back
on the machine.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.720
Malignancy spread
to Tim's brain and lungs.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.160
On dialysis,
he'll die from
another complication.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.680
That's your opinion.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.600
It's against
Tim's wishes,

05:46.600 --> 05:50.600
but if that's
what you want, OK.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.760
Give me more
definite symptoms.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.720
Waah!

06:03.720 --> 06:06.120
That's not
what I meant.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.880
How's she doing?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.000
Stinko.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.360
She's fussy.
She's throwing up.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.280
CBC shows
a rising white count.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.160
Any ideas
what's wrong?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.560
My guess is
intestinal infection.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.920
I started her
on ampicillin.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.800
You know what?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.920
I think we've got
appendicitis here.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.760
She's febrile.
No diarrhoea.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.680
Just because you're
on gastro rotation

06:32.680 --> 06:35.520
doesn't mean every cramp
requires surgery.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.680
Let's try
antibiotics and wait.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.960
She could
become toxic.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.880
I don't like
operating on babies

06:42.880 --> 06:44.760
unless there's
no alternative.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.240
It's a mistake.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.680
Thanks for consulting.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.080
I mean it.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.520
She's my patient.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.520
Face facts.
Diagnosis has never
been your strong point.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.960
Okey-dokey.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.360
Let's get
down to business.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.760
Write the old memoirs.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.120
Ellen, I could use
some more coffee!

07:16.120 --> 07:17.560
A dedication...

07:17.560 --> 07:19.000
Be there shortly.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.440
To Ellen,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.440
for her unflagging support
of me and my career

07:24.720 --> 07:27.480
for nigh on
these many years.

07:27.480 --> 07:31.480
Nigh on?

07:33.400 --> 07:34.320
Pirelli.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.240
Do you call yourself
a gardener?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.640
Unless you've
discovered a way

07:39.640 --> 07:43.000
to make roses thrive
on unfiltered luckys,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I suggest
you pick that up.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.840
Oh, boy.
I forgot.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.800
This is Dr Mark Craig.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.240
Fine, thank you.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.160
That's why I'm calling.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.000
I'd like an appointment
to fill that cavity.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.440
Three weeks?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.360
What's he giving away?

08:21.360 --> 08:25.360
I don't suppose you've had
a cancellation this morning.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.080
No, huh?

08:27.080 --> 08:29.480
OK. I'll call back later

08:29.480 --> 08:31.720
when I know my schedule.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.799
Thanks.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.799
For nothing.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.960
OK. Come on, come on.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.360
Chapter one.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.360
Chapter one.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.760
Let's take this logically.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.760
Where did it begin?

08:59.680 --> 09:01.120
Chapter one.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.360
A chance encounter.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.360
Mother meets father.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.680
Something we said?

09:18.680 --> 09:20.200
Something not said.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.720
She's lucky we didn't
j'accuse her.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.560
               She should have  copped
to the truth.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.680
My point exactly.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.600
We're first-year
residents.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.880
We have to
stick together.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.680
We don't all
get life jackets.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.080
You're on top
of things,

09:37.080 --> 09:39.480
but she's
a ball dropper.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.280
If we're careless,
we'll be Westphalled.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.560
Westphalled?

09:43.560 --> 09:46.360
A medic crushed
under the weight

09:46.360 --> 09:50.360
of a moving
ethical force.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.720
I like him,
but he's the reason

09:53.720 --> 09:57.080
this dump is sliding
into the Charles.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.000
Things
aren't so bad.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.680
You haven't tasted
my sausage.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.040
The O'Connors
will be here
any minute.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.920
If you
see them...

10:07.920 --> 10:09.040
Sure.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.680
I'll say  Johnny boy
isn't critical.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.960
At least I won't
eat dinner here.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.520
Me, neither.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.480
How about you
and me tonight?

10:19.480 --> 10:20.880
Division 16.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.040
Sorry.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.480
You on call?

10:23.480 --> 10:27.480
Involved...
with Dr Westphall.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.280
Oh.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.720
Hey, Birch.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.880
&lt; What?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.160
We got a problem.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.160
Dr Peter Schraith,
the noted sociologist,

10:40.800 --> 10:44.160
offers the theory
that every human being

10:44.160 --> 10:46.720
is uniquely suited

10:46.720 --> 10:49.600
to a single task in life.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.600
But rarely do task and being
become one.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.440
Was I born a surgeon?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.480
Did I intuitively know,

11:02.480 --> 11:06.480
at age 5, why the good lord
put me on this earth?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

11:24.120 --> 11:25.480
What is it?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.480
I brought your coffee.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.400
Your hair's a mess.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.280
How can I get
anything done

11:32.280 --> 11:34.680
when you're
constantly
interrupting me?

11:34.680 --> 11:38.000
I can't work
with all these
distractions.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.480
You wanted coffee.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.880
I'm going
to the hospital

11:41.880 --> 11:43.800
where I can
concentrate.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.800
Besides, my medical files
are stored there.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.880
Testing 1, 2, 3, 4.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.280
The quick brown fox

12:03.280 --> 12:06.800
jumped over the lazy dog.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.480
    # Start spreading the news!

12:10.480 --> 12:14.480
    # I'm leaving  today... #

12:29.040 --> 12:32.000
Hi.
Hi. You got one?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.120
Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.960
Jewish man goes
into the synagogue
and prays.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.360
He says,
"Oh, God, please,

12:39.360 --> 12:41.280
"I've never
won anything.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.160
"Please let me win
the lottery."

12:44.160 --> 12:45.600
You've heard this?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.720
No.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.560
A week later,
he's praying
in the synagogue.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.560
"Oh, God,
is it much to ask
to win the lottery?"

12:55.560 --> 12:57.440
Two weeks go by.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.400
He's back in there.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.200
"God, let me win
the lottery."

13:02.200 --> 13:04.160
Suddenly,
a voice says,

13:04.160 --> 13:06.080
"Saul,
meet me halfway.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.720
"Buy a ticket."

13:09.720 --> 13:12.280
Not bad,
your timing's improved.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.720
Thank you.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.720
You told me this machine
wouldn't do any more good.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.640
Your parents
weren't convinced.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.200
Oh.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.080
You've been straight
from the start.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.480
My parents play
"Let's pretend."

13:27.480 --> 13:30.840
I know I won't
see next summer.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.840
I want to make the best
of the time left.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.320
That's all
anyone wants.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.200
Last month
when I realised
what you meant,

13:41.200 --> 13:43.600
how my kidneys
were failing,

13:43.600 --> 13:47.600
I wanted...
I mean, I wished
that I could have...

13:50.160 --> 13:53.040
Well, you were
there for me.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.240
My family won't talk
about my death.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.240
Every time I start,
they cut me off.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.240
People think
ignoring problems
makes them go away.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.160
Mine won't...

14:06.160 --> 14:08.120
and time's running out.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.400
I'll talk
to your parents.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.280
Thanks. Oh, tell
them that joke.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.280
They could
use a laugh.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.000
My life's changed.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.400
Herding residents,
coping without Craig,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.320
snorkling
with a nurse.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.800
Really? Which one?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.680
My lips are sealed,

14:32.680 --> 14:34.600
which eliminated
oral high jinks.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.520
You're tamping
Chandler's pipe.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.000
I'm not ashamed.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.400
If you knew her,
you would.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.760
Hey, Seth!

14:42.760 --> 14:45.200
I gave the O'Connors
the bad news.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.640
How'd it go?

14:46.640 --> 14:50.600
Fine, considering.
They said you didn't
mention anything.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.640
Yeah, I held off.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.720
Why?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.600
I saw them
in the hallway,

14:56.600 --> 14:59.480
and suddenly I felt
vulnerable, inexperienced.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.400
He was my patient.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.320
I let him down.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.760
Even so...

15:04.760 --> 15:07.040
I'm glad it was you.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.520
You're older.
It's more comforting.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.720
Don't do it again.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.200
I'm sorry, Carol.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.480
Ehrlich wants us
to score an autopsy.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.400
Since you've
established yourself,

15:18.400 --> 15:20.160
will you ask them?

15:20.160 --> 15:24.160
No.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.960
I'm afraid
this is all, Mark.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.360
Our last office.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.760
You gave mine away
quickly.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.720
The body wasn't cold.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.120
This is inappropriate
for Dr Kiem.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.000
But fine for me.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.960
It is rather small.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.360
I'll make do.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.520
Good.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.360
Daniel,
some time I'd like

15:48.360 --> 15:51.040
some information
for my memoirs.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.480
Happy to cooperate.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.360
The past is
a funny thing.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.360
As I start to delve
in the last 30 years,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.080
remembering
colleagues and cases,

16:02.080 --> 16:03.520
it's truly staggering

16:03.520 --> 16:06.400
the amount of good
we've done,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.320
the lives we've saved.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.160
Let's face it, Daniel.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.160
In our own way,

16:12.160 --> 16:14.560
we in this
noble profession

16:14.560 --> 16:16.320
are miracle workers.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.320
I hold to a more
realistic perspective
about what we do.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.160
Keeps me humble.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.080
Can the false modesty.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.400
You know what I mean.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.160
I have patients
waiting.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.600
Remember 1965?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.520
Wasn't that
long ago.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.920
My first heart
bypass operation.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.440
That Irishman from
County Potato Head -

16:38.440 --> 16:39.880
O'Casey.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.560
The man was about
to dip his pen

16:43.560 --> 16:45.960
into the Grim Reaper's
inkwell.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.720
I saved his life.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.760
The hospital was abuzz.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.640
He had
liver complications

16:51.640 --> 16:53.560
resulting
from the by-pass.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.960
The man underwent
miserable treatments

16:55.960 --> 16:59.200
coupled with
many lingering
side effects.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.200
Did I or did I not
save his life?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.800
You did...

17:04.800 --> 17:07.119
I'm not sure
that's the point.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.960
If he had that
problem earlier,

17:09.960 --> 17:12.359
they'd have
rung his bell.

17:12.359 --> 17:13.599
Granted.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.280
What about the quality
of his life?

17:17.280 --> 17:19.119
He didn't complain!

17:19.119 --> 17:23.119
He had no time! Within
six months,  he was dead.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.600
Hi, do you mind?
No. Sit down.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.520
Helen's telling me
about her European trip.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.360
I've always been neutral
about Switzerland.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.760
Marcy seems
happy with Klaus.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.640
Their St Bernard
took to Richard,

17:39.640 --> 17:42.040
who looks adorable
in lederhosen.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.080
He's got the legs.
Can you come to dinner?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.800
Can't,
on call.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.200
What did you
say to my son?!

17:50.200 --> 17:52.600
Please sit down.
I'm too angry to sit!

17:52.600 --> 17:55.400
We just left him. His
conversation's  morbid.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.000
Tim's aware
of what's happening.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.480
You have to
diminish his fears.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.160
Lie to him?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.480
Your son's wonderful.
He's intelligent, funny

18:05.480 --> 18:08.560
and won't be
with us much longer.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.520
I know it's hard,

18:10.520 --> 18:12.920
but he's
the one dying.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.800
I want
another doctor.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.760
I want
another hospital.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.760
He wants us to let
Tim think he'll die.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.360
Do you have children,
Dr Westphall?

18:24.360 --> 18:26.000
A son and daughter.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.360
Suppose you'd
never be able

18:28.360 --> 18:31.280
to camp with
your boy again.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.600
Wouldn't you do
everything to stop that?

18:34.600 --> 18:37.880
Maybe you'd better
find another doctor.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.280
You're damn right.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.280
If Timmy's dying,
you're killing him.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.480
She wouldn't
ask for the autopsy?

18:48.480 --> 18:52.480
Novino said, "Birch iced him.
It's her  responsibility."

18:52.960 --> 18:54.760
First-years' are
soldered together.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760
She has a reason.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.360
She's after me.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.560
Don't be paranoid.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.920
Tonight, when
she's snuggling up
to Westphall,

19:02.920 --> 19:04.840
she'll tell him
everything.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.280
True.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.160
I guess your goose's
really plucked.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.880
I was doing
you a favour.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.880
You injected the dilantin
like you caulk a window.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.200
His BP just
dropped out.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.080
You said
just get it done.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.040
I know.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.480
You're right.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.360
Novino could
screw us both up.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.960
In case she doesn't,
let the paperwork fall.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.920
Maybe I'll
talk to Westphall.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.360
Yeah, great...

19:35.360 --> 19:39.360
then kiss
your residency good-bye.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.040
Hi, kid.
Hi, Dad.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.760
Mrs McCleary wants
the autism group

19:49.760 --> 19:51.520
to meet
here Thursday.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.800
OK.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.240
Hi, sport.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.680
What's for dinner?

19:55.680 --> 19:58.080
You wanted
to barbeque tonight.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.000
Oh, right.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.440
Rough day?

20:01.440 --> 20:02.560
Yeah.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.800
Want to talk
about it?

20:04.800 --> 20:05.920
No.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.280
So instead
you'll sit here,

20:08.280 --> 20:10.200
sip and sulk.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.600
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.040
Must be
administrative.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.760
Everyone says
you're a good doctor.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.680
Little time for it.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.680
No, it's just
I'm treating a boy
about your age, 17.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.320
Dad, I'm 21.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.160
Well, he seems
about your age.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.600
You're saying I act
like a teenager?

20:32.600 --> 20:35.480
No...I just
mean he's young,

20:35.480 --> 20:36.920
and he's dying,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.320
and I can't
do anything

20:39.320 --> 20:42.120
but try and control
his pain.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.960
Must be rough on his folks.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.280
When adults die,
they leave a will,

20:47.280 --> 20:48.760
property, heirloom.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.400
There must be something
a kid can leave

20:52.400 --> 20:53.840
besides a memory.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.760
If I could only...

20:55.760 --> 20:59.760
maybe I'm too locked
into the old methods?

21:00.080 --> 21:02.000
Glad you asked?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.280
Yeah.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.040
I will barbeque.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.800
Come on, son.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.800
Come outside
and help your dad.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.240
Should we get
paper plates?

21:16.240 --> 21:20.240
Or a rubber house.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
DRUMS PLAYING

21:22.920 --> 21:26.920
First time I ever
made love to a beat.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.120
I want to kick
his cymbals.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.520
Keep it down
over there!

21:32.520 --> 21:34.400
DRUMMING STOPS

21:34.400 --> 21:36.800
What's taking
you so long?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.720
I'm looking
for something.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.160
What?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.600
Eye make-up remover.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.080
I'm out.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.760
Didn't I leave some
last time?

21:45.760 --> 21:48.640
Nope.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.960
Mind if I bring over
some essentials?

21:51.960 --> 21:54.080
Thought you'd
never ask.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.960
Your feet
are cold.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.440
So's your floor.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.320
Bring over
a fluffy rug, too.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.720
You got it.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.720
DRUMS PLAYING

22:08.920 --> 22:11.320
I worried about
the passion,

22:11.320 --> 22:12.760
but you are...

22:12.760 --> 22:13.720
Naturally.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.120
And I?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.920
And you what?

22:16.920 --> 22:19.000
Did the earth move?

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
I thought that was
the box springs slipping.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.120
LAUGHTER

22:26.120 --> 22:27.680
I could kill
Jack Morrison.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.680
Now that begs
explanation.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.080
The McClenny baby
was readmitted

22:32.080 --> 22:34.360
with bad
intestinal trouble.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.720
McClenny...yeah,
she's had problems

22:36.720 --> 22:39.600
since her delivery
two years ago.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.480
And Jack, with his
infinite wisdom,

22:42.480 --> 22:44.040
thinks it's
appendicitis.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.480
That's unusual.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.920
Appendicitis?

22:46.920 --> 22:49.200
No, Jack thinking.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.560
Would you
cut it out!

22:51.560 --> 22:53.960
Why are you so hot?

22:53.960 --> 22:57.480
He went  to the parents
behind my back,

22:57.480 --> 22:58.920
got them confused.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.320
I had to
calm them down.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.760
What about Morrison?

23:02.760 --> 23:04.040
Couldn't find him.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.480
Chandler...

23:05.480 --> 23:07.880
tomorrow is
your day off.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.320
Relax.

23:09.320 --> 23:13.320
I can't.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.600
How about now?

23:25.200 --> 23:27.360
Dad?

23:27.360 --> 23:30.840
Dad?

23:30.840 --> 23:34.840
Yes, son.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.960
I want to talk to you
about my future.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.320
Tommy?

23:45.320 --> 23:48.680
I know this is
a touchy subject,

23:48.680 --> 23:51.920
but what will
happen to me later?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.320
Oh, Tommy.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.720
After you're gone,

23:54.720 --> 23:57.640
and Lizzie's married
and moved away?

23:57.640 --> 23:59.560
Who'll
look after me?

23:59.560 --> 24:01.400
I'll always be here.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
No, you won't.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.800
Look, you don't
need anyone.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.680
You're cured.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.520
Dad, this is
only a dream.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.520
Eventually,
you'll have to face
this problem.

24:21.320 --> 24:25.320
I'll never
be all right.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.560
Bye, Dad. I'm
going to watch TV.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.120
No, Tim...

24:30.120 --> 24:31.720
Wait... Tommy!

24:31.720 --> 24:35.720
FREQUENCY HUMS

24:51.040 --> 24:53.400
When was
she treated?

24:53.400 --> 24:55.840
How's the McClenny
baby?

24:55.840 --> 24:58.400
Her temperature's
up to 104.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.280
No improvement?

25:00.280 --> 25:02.680
I want
a surgical consult.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.600
Whoa! You mean
McClenny?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.560
Yes. Her
temperature's 104.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.000
She's still vomiting.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.800
Your call
is appendix?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.200
Uh-huh.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.440
You're willing
to operate?

25:13.440 --> 25:15.320
She hasn't responded.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.880
Antibiotics do not
work instantaneously.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.800
I know, but...

25:19.800 --> 25:23.160
Pretty lame to wait
until chandler's gone

25:23.160 --> 25:25.040
to schedule surgery.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.040
Under no circumstances
change the treatment.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.520
Morning.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.960
Call Audio-Visual
for a camera set up.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.240
State Of The Union
address?

25:36.240 --> 25:39.960
Just an idea
that came to me.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.360
Glad I
ran into you.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.800
Let's have coffee.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.640
I want input
on my book.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.120
Can it wait?

25:48.120 --> 25:50.160
I have a meeting.

25:50.160 --> 25:54.000
What I need is
a jumping off point.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.560
My notion
needs a concept.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.000
What's your notion?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.400
You remember
my first bypass?

26:00.400 --> 26:01.520
No.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.400
Come on.
Sure you do. 1965.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.800
Patient named O'Casey.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.920
Some people
called me a hero.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.600
You've done so many,
it's routine.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.000
Saving lives
is never routine.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
But our methods are.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.720
Dr Auschlander?

26:22.720 --> 26:24.640
Glad I caught you.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.080
How's the family?

26:26.080 --> 26:28.320
Uh...fine.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.720
You know,
I was thinking...

26:30.720 --> 26:33.600
even though
we have tragic events,

26:33.600 --> 26:35.520
mankind continues
to progress.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.560
Nuclear-powered pacemakers,
synthetic genes,

26:38.560 --> 26:41.440
and I don't mean
Levi Strauss.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.880
What's up?

26:42.880 --> 26:45.760
A problem with
my gastro rotation.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.160
There's this
two year old...

26:48.160 --> 26:49.600
..Sorry. One, please.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.600
..There's a two-year-old
I'm convinced
has appendicitis.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.280
Problem is,
she's Chandler's
patient.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.680
He thinks it's
intestinal problems.

26:58.680 --> 27:02.520
Dr Turner heard
about the difference
of opinion.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.600
She ripped me apart.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.040
So?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.760
Well...

27:08.760 --> 27:12.760
I may be
out of line here...

27:13.560 --> 27:15.960
You see,
they're an item.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.880
They're
sort of dating.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.320
Now, I...

27:19.320 --> 27:21.720
That's how
the story goes.

27:21.720 --> 27:25.720
They haven't
made it public yet.

27:27.320 --> 27:31.280
I'm thinking that
Dr Turner may be, well...

27:31.280 --> 27:35.120
you know,
agreeing with Phil
on blind faith.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.040
For the wrong reasons.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.400
I'm stuck just short
of a confrontation.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.800
I am not
in the business
of rumours.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.200
If you disagree,

27:45.200 --> 27:48.000
take it up
with them.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.520
Intrigue or egos

27:49.520 --> 27:51.600
shouldn't hinder
patient care.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.600
This problem
is strictly medical,
you understand?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.440
Mixed doubles
autopsy,

27:59.440 --> 28:01.360
then breakfast
at Wimbledon.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.800
Your serve.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.200
Liver appears
normal in size.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.800
Any surface
irregularities?

28:06.800 --> 28:08.200
Well, um...

28:08.200 --> 28:10.600
some evidence
of chronic
inflammation.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.000
Who got the OK
from the O'Connors?

28:14.000 --> 28:14.960
Me.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.320
Me.
I asked.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.640
No, you blubbered.
I translated.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.040
You didn't
get yes either.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.920
And where were you?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.680
While
they badgered...

28:25.680 --> 28:27.080
That wasn't badgering.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.800
She was crying.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.160
Because her husband
just died.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.880
And who's
responsible?

28:32.880 --> 28:36.240
Meaning what?

28:36.240 --> 28:39.120
Anyway, while
I was explaining to...

28:39.120 --> 28:42.480
Your buddy Westphall
will cover your mistakes.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.480
What?

28:43.480 --> 28:44.600
What?
Really?

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
It's not
your business.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.680
Shut up.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.800
Women.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.640
I'm leaving.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.040
What's wrong
with this statement?

28:55.040 --> 28:57.160
New York, New York.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.560
I said
the state first.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.000
Tim, that's terrible.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.400
Yeah. I know.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.960
Timmy,
where were you?

29:03.960 --> 29:05.440
Discussing
my future.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.840
I'm considering
becoming a doctor.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.160
Where's Mom?

29:09.160 --> 29:12.760
She'll be here once
Aunt Sally comes to babysit.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.200
Can we talk?

29:14.200 --> 29:15.360
Sure.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.760
Get some rest.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.760
OK. Anything but
the dialysis machine.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.440
Timmy seems, uh...
much better today.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.040
More energy.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.080
That's only temporary,
I'm afraid.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.760
Dr Westphall...

29:36.760 --> 29:39.160
He is going to live?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.560
I wish
that were true,

29:41.560 --> 29:44.440
but I'm afraid
that the tumour

29:44.440 --> 29:48.440
has spread
beyond our control.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.840
Last night,
the wife and I  got
into a real screamer.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.000
I know the other
children heard us,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.440
and, well...

30:08.440 --> 30:09.840
I'm worried.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.840
They've spent
so much time
visiting Tim.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.880
And they're
asking me questions.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.360
What do I say?

30:18.360 --> 30:21.840
Tell them the truth.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.720
I know you must
think we're...

30:24.720 --> 30:26.160
we're
terrible parents.

30:26.160 --> 30:30.000
No, I don't.
Not at all.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.760
Is it possible
you could talk to them

30:33.760 --> 30:35.760
about what's going on?

30:35.760 --> 30:37.200
Don't underestimate them.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.080
Kids know intuitively
when something's
happening.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.080
Parents just put it
in perspective.

30:44.360 --> 30:47.600
I can't even
do that for myself.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.160
I think you're
depriving them

30:50.160 --> 30:53.000
of something
they can't do again.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Saying goodbye.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.920
Temperature's
still 104.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.320
She can't keep
liquids down.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.200
Possibly
the appendix ruptured.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.160
Tenderness
on right quadrant.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.560
Becoming generalised.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.960
She hasn't
passed any stool
since admission.

31:37.960 --> 31:41.960
Erica...

31:44.360 --> 31:47.720
Prep OR 3
for a paediatric
appendectomy.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.760
Who's on call?

31:49.760 --> 31:52.160
Yeah. He's fine.
Thanks.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.080
I'll let Chandler know.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.480
Later.
Let's hit the road.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.480
I had enough trouble
delivering her
to lose her now.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.400
Can't stand this weather.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.960
Next you'll
complain about
the wind chill.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.760
I'm going to miss
the snow.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.160
Here's a card
from Eddie.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.560
He's in Saratoga
sneaking into
the track.

32:18.560 --> 32:22.080
"Get well soon."

32:22.080 --> 32:23.640
Fat chance.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.640
Why don't they have
"sorry you're dying"
cards?

32:27.760 --> 32:31.760
Timmy, don't
talk that way.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.360
I'm real tired, Mom.

32:38.840 --> 32:42.840
Close your eyes.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.720
We need rain
to break this humidity.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.560
Paper said we'll
top the record.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.960
I feel like
taking another shower.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.880
I miss the lake.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.800
Shh! Don't say that.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.560
He'll hear you.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.600
No, he's sleeping.

33:03.600 --> 33:07.600
He looks
so peaceful.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.080
Tim?

33:12.880 --> 33:14.480
Timmy.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.400
He had a fever...

33:16.400 --> 33:17.760
Tim?

33:17.760 --> 33:20.040
My God.
Get the doctor.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.000
Timmy?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.960
&lt; I need a doctor!

33:22.960 --> 33:25.040
Tim!

33:25.040 --> 33:29.040
Timmy, don't...

33:35.000 --> 33:38.640
                 Ah.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.640
Ah.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.920
At-choo!

33:47.920 --> 33:51.360
Excuse me.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.840
Ehrlich!

33:52.840 --> 33:55.720
Dr Craig, what
a pleasant surprise.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.160
How's Mrs Craig?

33:57.160 --> 33:58.280
Good.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.240
Barbara?

33:59.240 --> 34:00.160
Barbara?
Good.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.640
Barbara?
Good.
And your hand?

34:01.640 --> 34:02.880
Goodbye.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.280
How does anyone
find anything?

34:05.280 --> 34:06.720
It's a disaster.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.639
What do you want?

34:08.639 --> 34:11.520
Somewhere are some
boxes of mine.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.280
They're my papers.

34:13.280 --> 34:17.280
I saw some stuff
over here with
your name on it.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.960
Aha! Here's
one of them.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.679
Great. Great.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.719
Oh, a lot
of stuff here.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.120
What are you going to do
with all this crap?

34:29.120 --> 34:30.400
Crap?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.320
For your
information, Ehrlich,

34:32.320 --> 34:35.199
in these boxes
is the documentation

34:35.199 --> 34:37.080
of my entire career.

34:37.080 --> 34:41.080
All the blood,
sweat, and triumphs
of 30 years.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.760
Details that will help
guide and inspire

34:44.760 --> 34:46.679
future generations
of doctors.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.639
An instructional tool,

34:48.639 --> 34:50.320
a visual compendium.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.320
Every picture
tells a story.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.280
You are a sap.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.200
I'm writing
my memoirs.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.080
You should know
something about me.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.480
I can type,
take dictation,

35:03.480 --> 35:05.360
even make good coffee.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.960
If there's anything I can do...
Maybe it's a good idea

35:07.960 --> 35:09.840
to have
the pupil's POV.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.800
Fine.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.240
Fine.
The resident's
reminiscences.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.560
Uh-huh.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.640
Ehrlich?

35:14.640 --> 35:15.760
Yes?

35:15.760 --> 35:19.760
Get the light
on your way out.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.160
I told the service

35:26.160 --> 35:28.560
you didn't
have to come back.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.600
The surgery went fine.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.960
That's
nice to hear.

35:31.960 --> 35:32.880
Whose?

35:32.880 --> 35:34.360
The McClenny baby's.

35:34.360 --> 35:38.360
You went to the parents
behind my back again?

35:39.280 --> 35:40.760
Her appendix burst.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.360
What?

35:44.360 --> 35:45.800
How is she?

35:45.800 --> 35:49.800
I said she's fine.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.960
You know the worst part
about this?

35:53.960 --> 35:57.800
You and Roxanne
made me doubt myself.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.760
What did Roxanne do?

35:59.760 --> 36:01.640
Don't give me that.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.520
You had her
keep an eye on me.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.520
She was like a guard dog
sniffing and barking

36:09.800 --> 36:13.160
and refusing to change
the treatment.

36:13.160 --> 36:16.960
It's one thing
if you don't trust me,

36:16.960 --> 36:19.880
it's another
to have your girlfriend

36:19.880 --> 36:21.760
cut me in half.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.680
Jack, I'm sorry.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.680
So am I.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.000
Top of the class.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
What else?

36:56.400 --> 37:00.400
KNOCK ON DOOR
  Hi.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.560
Donald.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.920
I'm glad this day's
almost over.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.360
Yeah, me too.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.760
Still want
to interview me?

37:09.760 --> 37:13.560
There's no rush.
Tomorrow...whenever.

37:13.560 --> 37:17.560
Nice clock.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.520
"Time does not
stand still

37:26.520 --> 37:28.920
"for hearts
beating with love.

37:28.920 --> 37:32.920
"I wait for
our next encounter."

37:33.080 --> 37:34.480
From Eve Leighton.

37:34.480 --> 37:38.040
Your heart transplant
patient two years ago.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.960
Just before she died,

37:39.960 --> 37:43.320
she said she wanted
to sign up

37:43.320 --> 37:45.400
as an organ donor.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.280
Her life
was on the line,

37:48.280 --> 37:51.960
and she's thinking
about how to help others.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.320
That's a brave lady.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.720
You're damn right.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.640
People call us
courageous.

37:58.640 --> 38:02.480
We just
pull the strings,
call the shots.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.400
Our lives go on.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.760
We really
put very little
in jeopardy.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.600
The patients
are the heroes.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.480
The strength
of Eve Leighton's spirit.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.480
That's what my book
should be concentrating on,

38:18.800 --> 38:22.000
not glamorizing myself
and my accomplishments.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
The focus should be
on human beings -

38:26.280 --> 38:30.280
the miracle and
the maintenance of life.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.360
Would you excuse me?

38:36.360 --> 38:38.440
Sure.

38:38.440 --> 38:42.440
See you tomorrow.

38:53.800 --> 38:57.640
Chapter one.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.560
I know how people die,

39:00.560 --> 39:04.560
but I still
don't know why.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.920
Hi, Phil.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.760
I thought
you'd be asleep.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.200
Me, too.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.560
How was your day?

39:22.560 --> 39:24.000
Off.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
It seems
to be going around.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.560
I'm not in the mood now.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.400
What's the matter?

39:37.400 --> 39:41.280
Why were you involved
in the McClenny case?

39:41.280 --> 39:43.280
The child needed surgery.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.560
Yeah, she would
have died.

39:45.560 --> 39:49.560
I mean before that,
with Morrison.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.000
I was
protecting you, pal.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.480
Our sleeping together

39:56.480 --> 40:00.320
doesn't mean you
need to speak for me.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.720
It makes me look bad.

40:02.720 --> 40:06.720
When I have a problem,
don't try and fix it.

40:07.520 --> 40:11.520
You can't tell me things
and not expect me to care.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.040
Something's wrong

40:14.040 --> 40:18.040
if we can't
be each other's
sounding board.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.560
Look, Phil...

40:21.560 --> 40:25.080
we have very special
circumstances.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.360
Yeah.

40:26.360 --> 40:29.240
We need
to have special rules.

40:29.240 --> 40:33.080
If you get the flu,
I'll be here.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.920
Or if you're ticked off
with your folks,

40:36.920 --> 40:40.280
or wonder why God
gave us souls,

40:40.280 --> 40:43.600
but if our love's
going to work,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.000
if it's going to last,

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
let's not talk
about medicine.

40:54.640 --> 40:58.640
Let's leave the hospital
at the hospital.

41:00.400 --> 41:04.240
OK.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.120
Can we put this
behind us?

41:07.120 --> 41:08.560
Sure.

41:08.560 --> 41:11.920
Good.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.920
I still don't want
to make love tonight.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.880
Why is everyone sad?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.720
Mr and Mrs Moynihan...

41:39.720 --> 41:43.720
Tim left you a gift.

41:44.520 --> 41:48.520
He made it this morning.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.360
'Hi, everybody.
It's me, Tim.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.760
'I guess you know that.

42:01.760 --> 42:05.160
'If you don't like
what I'm saying,

42:05.160 --> 42:07.560
'you can shut me off,

42:07.560 --> 42:11.560
'but we've been doing a lot
of that lately.

42:11.840 --> 42:15.680
'Dr Westphall,
what am I supposed to do?

42:15.680 --> 42:17.600
'You're doing
fine.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.600
'OK.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.720
'Um...

42:26.720 --> 42:28.160
'I, uh...

42:28.160 --> 42:32.160
'I want to talk.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.840
'Not about dying,

42:34.840 --> 42:38.840
'but, uh...
what about after?

42:40.160 --> 42:43.520
'Michael, you're going
to be the oldest brother.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.400
'That's
a big responsibility,

42:45.400 --> 42:49.400
'but I think
you can handle it.

42:50.200 --> 42:54.040
'And, uh... Sean,
don't throw dirt,

42:54.040 --> 42:57.880
'even if Wayne McMeehan
throws it first.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.760
'And, uh...

42:59.760 --> 43:01.440
'Kathleen...

43:01.440 --> 43:05.440
'I know you'll grow up
to be a beautiful girl.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.960
'Keep working
on that spelling.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.960
'You'll need that, too.

43:14.160 --> 43:18.160
'I, uh... I guess...
Oh, no. No, wait.

43:19.320 --> 43:23.320
'Mom and Dad...

43:28.120 --> 43:32.120
'I don't know.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.640
'Even though...

43:38.640 --> 43:42.640
'even though we do
a lot of stuff together

43:43.440 --> 43:47.440
'as a family...

43:49.160 --> 43:53.160
'it doesn't mean
we're close.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.360
'I mean, before I was sick,

43:57.360 --> 44:01.360
'I was embarrassed
to tell you how I felt.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.080
'As if being honest
was a weakness.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.600
'No more barriers,
Moynihans,

44:14.600 --> 44:18.600
'cos all we want to do
is be loved by each other.

44:22.280 --> 44:26.280
'And I love you all...

44:26.440 --> 44:30.440
'very much.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.200
'Listen, don't worry
about missing me,

44:35.200 --> 44:39.200
'because I'll always
be there.

44:39.800 --> 44:43.800
'If not in spirit,
on VHS, huh?'

44:52.480 --> 44:54.120
Thank you.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.960
Where's Tim?

44:55.960 --> 45:57.000
Oh. Oh, honey.
