00:01.523 --> 00:03.351
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.394 --> 00:05.614
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:05.657 --> 00:08.356
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:08.399 --> 00:09.618
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.360
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:12.403 --> 00:14.884
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:14.927 --> 00:17.800
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.410
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:19.454 --> 00:21.282
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.066
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:23.110 --> 00:24.676
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.635
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:26.678 --> 00:28.289
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:28.332 --> 00:30.595
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.380
Looks like I need a new name.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.164
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:40.344 --> 00:42.433
Right over here,
Lieutenant.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.872
Thank God you're here.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.613
Dylan Reinhart,
Lizzie's partner.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.398
David Wu,
Jasmine's fiancé.

00:50.441 --> 00:53.314
I just had to go I.D.
Abby's body.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.404
Jazz, I'm so sorry.
Can you tell us what happened?

00:56.447 --> 00:58.841
Some people at Abby's party
kept grabbing at her.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.235
I tried to put a stop to it,
she flipped out,

01:01.278 --> 01:03.454
and she went somewhere
to calm down.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.282
And after a while,
nobody could find her.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.676
Then the valet says she
jumped in some random car

01:07.719 --> 01:08.764
and drove away.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.201
Just give us a minute.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.773
Abby Wright stole a car?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.775
And the valet
let her do that?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.429
He thought the car was hers.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.648
Jazz, I know you want
to be here for Abby,

01:23.692 --> 01:25.476
but you've been
through enough today.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.304
We've got this. Go home.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.393
That's an order
from your friend.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.003
I'll need hourly updates.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.309
Absolutely.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.144
Came down from
up there.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.493
Witnesses say the car

01:42.537 --> 01:45.017
was going way above
the speed limit.

Why would Abby Wright
steal a car

01:47.150 --> 01:48.934
and go speeding off a bridge?

Abby Wright's annual
charity auction.

02:01.164 --> 02:04.428
It's the fun fund-raising gala
of the year.

: Wright is wrong!
Wright is wrong!

02:07.475 --> 02:09.477
For the record, I didn't
ask you to marry me

02:09.520 --> 02:11.609
because you're friends with the
owner of the New York Hudsons,

02:11.653 --> 02:12.915
but it doesn't hurt.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.308
Oh, yeah,
I was a baller

02:14.351 --> 02:15.700

networking

02:15.744 --> 02:17.615

white girl in the Bronx.

not playing, Dylan.

don't watch it live,

over what happens.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.824
she did a full loop
around the block.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.999
Probably thought
she was being followed

10:09.043 --> 10:10.522
and wanted to confirm it.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.872
That would explain
the weaving.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.438
She thought
she could lose him?

10:13.482 --> 10:15.223
DYLAN:
And when she couldn't,
that 911 call

10:15.266 --> 10:16.528
was her last hope.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.095
Any chance
he caught up with her?

10:18.139 --> 10:19.444
Did you find evidence
of another car?

10:19.488 --> 10:21.316
Found pieces
of a rear marker light

10:21.359 --> 10:22.665
in the wheel well.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.930
Matched it to a '69 Mustang.

10:26.974 --> 10:30.064
Some '69 Mustangs have
the exact paint color

10:30.107 --> 10:30.934
found on the vehicle.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.675
Grabber Blue.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.677
Grabber Blue?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.027
I know. Sounds like a character
Burt Reynolds

10:37.071 --> 10:38.899
played in the '70s.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.248
Or something you'd hear
in a Smurfs

10:40.291 --> 10:41.553
sexual harassment deposition.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.294
That's funny.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.687
You're funny.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.255
I gotta say,
I'd never use

10:47.298 --> 10:50.345
a sweet vintage ride like that
to run somebody off the road.

10:50.388 --> 10:53.696
Maybe the killer wanted Abby
to know he was following her.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.393
That's why
you're the cop.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.091
Mm, he's not a cop.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.483
Oh. Uh...

10:58.527 --> 11:00.268
Are you guys...?

11:00.311 --> 11:02.400
No.
No. No.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.101
Let me print out that
diagnostics report.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.582
He's flirting with you.Oh, he's being nice

11:10.626 --> 11:12.497
because we know Detective Fucci.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.890
Stop being uptight.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.152
I'm not uptight.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
Only an uptight person
would say that.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.852
Everything about
this guy is genuine.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.244
His words are unguarded.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.159
When you talk, he focuses
on what you're saying.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.032
His shoulders
slouch towards you.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.468
That means he wants
to take care of you.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.078
Oh, that's a lovely
analysis, Doc,

11:28.122 --> 11:30.080
but I don't need to
be taken care of.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.255
We all do.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.604
Once in a while.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
It's time you got
back out there.

11:34.258 --> 11:37.044
Into the metaphorical field,
if you will.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.785
I won't. I'm not ready.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.047
I just buried my fiancé.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.049
Charlie died over a year ago.

11:42.092 --> 11:45.226
Not that time is a factor
when it comes to grief, but...

11:45.269 --> 11:47.010
I've been paying attention
to you, Detective.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.403
You laugh, you joke.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.405
You want to help
other people.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.843
All strong signs
of recovering from loss.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.717
I'll grease the wheels.No, d-d-don't...

11:57.760 --> 11:59.022
Are you single, Steve?

11:59.066 --> 12:00.284
Asking for a friend.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.939
Is he always this subtle?

12:02.983 --> 12:04.941
Like a monster truck.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.728
I was trying to be professional,

12:08.771 --> 12:10.077
but I think your partner's
giving me

12:10.120 --> 12:11.774
the green light to ask you out.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.430
How about dinner sometime?She'd love to.

12:15.473 --> 12:19.216
Uh, maybe she would like
a say in this.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.435
Uh... Ooh.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.219
Oh.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.136
I'm free tomorrow night.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.659
Great. Yeah.
Great.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.574
Call you later.

12:32.577 --> 12:36.059
Tomorrow night?
You really are a piece of work.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.322
We both know you have
dinner plans tomorrow night.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.760
Takeout, at your desk,
working on this case.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.239
Well, if I have to cancel,
I'll cancel.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.806
It's not a big deal.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.200
What is a big deal
is that we have a solid lead.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.201
And we need to work.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.117
A Grabber Blue '69 Mustang?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.423
I don't know anybody
with a car like that.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.817
Abby called 911
right before she crashed.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.167
We think someone
may have been following her.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.734
Any idea
who that could be?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.432
I don't.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.567
Do... do you think
they killed her?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.483
We don't know. What we do know
is that she was a public figure

13:08.526 --> 13:10.093
getting a lot
of negative attention.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.661
A lot of people hated
her decision to move the team.

13:12.704 --> 13:15.229
Dealing with Abby's hate mail,
hate e-mails, tweets

13:15.272 --> 13:17.100
became a full-time job.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.536
Did that change her in any way?

13:18.580 --> 13:22.192
She seemed more fatigued lately.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.109
Fans were sending bomb threats.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.286
A few tried to get
past security.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.114
We'd get dead rats sent to us.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.812
Ew.Did you save the hate mail?

13:32.855 --> 13:34.248
It's all logged and filed.Great.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.337
We're gonna need
to take them to the station.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.209
We'll be in touch.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.384
Yeah.Thank you.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.169
DYLAN:
Hate mail is usually motivated

13:42.212 --> 13:43.692
by highly charged subjects

13:43.735 --> 13:45.868
like religious
or political beliefs.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.783
Matters of such
critical importance

13:47.827 --> 13:49.916
to some people
that they are defined

13:49.959 --> 13:52.135
by those ideas, but...
sports?

13:52.179 --> 13:54.877
Oh, sports fans
can be fanatics.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.184
That's why I'd rather
play, not watch.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.882
Uh, can you take care
of the hate mail without me?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.319
Yeah. Why?
Where are you going?

14:02.363 --> 14:04.321
Field research.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.110
It's not what you think.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.415
I'm not here to judge.Thanks.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.591
I merely want to observe
sports fans' behavior

14:13.635 --> 14:14.810
in their natural
environment.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.986
Well, we-we feed
the seals at noon.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.683
I'm sorry.
That was patronizing.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.468
Um...

14:20.511 --> 14:22.862
This woman was murdered.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.343
Do you mind: Sorry.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.129
A woman was murdered, and
it's possible her killer

14:29.172 --> 14:31.261
was someone who took his
love of sports too far.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.873
Uh-huh.It would be really useful
for me to understand

14:33.916 --> 14:36.701
that sort of homicidal fervor
in a more emotional way.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.834
"Homicidal fervor"?
What?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.010
Sorry again.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.446
Help me.

14:42.490 --> 14:46.102
I know you. I-I understand
everything about you

14:46.146 --> 14:48.322
except your love of sports.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.019
I mean, you walk around
wearing a jersey

14:50.063 --> 14:51.455
with another man's name on it.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.109
:
Okay.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.068
You want to know the dark secret
about sports fans?

14:55.111 --> 14:56.678
Yes.Get your pen ready now.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.680
Oh, phonographic memory.Mm... okay.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.377
We... we connect with a team.Mm-hmm.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.944
We get to know the players.Mm-hmm.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.599
And we want them to win.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.427
That's all
there is to it.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.124
It's more complicated than that.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.212
Yeah, you're right,
Dylan, you're right.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.998
Sports are also fun.
They're fun.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.130
You know, playing ball with
my buddies after school,

15:14.174 --> 15:15.958
it was the best part
about growing up.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.395
Soccer hooligans, uh,
brawls at games, death threats.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.180
Scientists who study
the brains of sports fans

15:20.223 --> 15:21.833
have recently discovered
mirror neurons...

15:21.877 --> 15:23.792
: I'm not gonna
let you ruin sports

15:23.835 --> 15:26.229
with behavioral analysis,
all right?

15:26.273 --> 15:27.665
Look, uh...

15:27.709 --> 15:29.885
Okay, okay,
let me ask you a question.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.235
If Beethoven and Brahms
were contestants

15:32.279 --> 15:35.195
on a music reality show,
who would you root for?

15:37.197 --> 15:38.981
Hmm?Well, it wouldn't matter.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.678
Because music would win.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.245
Oh...
Classical music

15:42.289 --> 15:44.378
contributes
to the cultural zeitgeist.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.423
Sports are for people
with misplaced aggression.

15:48.077 --> 15:51.428
Let me guess-- you're sorry.

15:51.472 --> 15:55.563
MAN :
...going on and on like this
is the most tragic death

15:55.606 --> 15:58.087
New York City has seen
since John Lennon,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.916
ignoring the fact
that she wasn't one of us.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.179
I don't care if she was born
in the Bronx.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.529
The moment she even thought
of moving our team...Excuse me. Who is that?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.531
...she was no longer
a New Yorker.The mayor of Hudsons Nation.

16:07.575 --> 16:10.752
Does His Honor have a name?Tomahawk.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.319
It's his podcast.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.277
TOMAHAWK:
Look at all these articles.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
The same newspapers
that criticized her...

16:16.062 --> 16:17.541
DYLAN:
The Abby Wright party.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.674
I know that voice.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.502
DYLAN: Pull up that video
of the waiter.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.938
JASMINE:
Wait. That's him.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.374
That's the guy.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.594
I remember that waiter.
Total slacker.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.509
I asked him for a drink
three times.

16:28.552 --> 16:29.684
He's all over social media.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.947
Name is Tom Sarkeysian.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.994
Let's see what else this
attention seeker overshared.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.126
Oh. Is that a mooning?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.215
Two Toronto players. Yeah.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.739
Not at all unusual to expose
one's gluteus maximus

16:41.783 --> 16:43.524
to multimillionaires.

16:43.567 --> 16:47.093
So, he snuck into the party
to get to Abby Wright?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.356
Not only did he sneak in,
but look what he drives.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.706
'69 Mustang,
Grabber Blue.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.924
What a coincidence.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.317
Pick his ass up.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
I want to interrogate him
myself.

17:03.457 --> 17:07.069
So, Tomahawk
sneaks into a private event

17:07.113 --> 17:09.898
so he can scare
a tough-as-nails CEO

17:09.941 --> 17:12.596
into stealing a car
in order to frighten her enough

17:12.640 --> 17:14.859
to run her off the road?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.600
I wouldn't exactly
call it airtight.

17:16.644 --> 17:17.862
Might not make
behavioral sense,

17:17.906 --> 17:19.908
but he snuck in, her
car went off the road,

17:19.951 --> 17:22.258
he drives a '69 Mustang,
and she has the paint

17:22.302 --> 17:23.694
of a '69 Mustang on hers.

17:23.738 --> 17:24.913
Those are facts.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.349
Um, you're single,
ready to date,

17:26.393 --> 17:28.351
a hot guy asks you out,
and you choose a night

17:28.395 --> 17:30.136
you know you won't be free.
Those are facts, too.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.963
My personal life has
nothing to do with this.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.530
I gave him my number.
He hasn't called.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.316
He will. I'm merely stating
that facts and behavior

17:36.359 --> 17:37.926
often contradict one another.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.276
As much as Tomahawk may have
hated what Abby was doing,

17:40.320 --> 17:42.539
he made a living from it,
so why kill her?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.455
He's a testosterone-fueled
sports bro,

17:45.499 --> 17:47.283
pissed that she's
moving his team.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.111
Maybe he took his
aggression too far.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.548
Uh, testosterone does
not cause aggression.

17:51.592 --> 17:52.941
It triggers
whatever behavior

17:52.984 --> 17:55.422
helps a person maintain
his or her status.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.901
Sometimes the facts
don't add up.

17:56.945 --> 18:00.296
And sometimes they do.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.081
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.518
Can I help you?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.998
NYPD. Is Tom
Sarkeysian home?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.348
TOMAHAWK :
They think we can't remember

18:08.391 --> 18:09.436
everything they printed
last week?

18:09.479 --> 18:10.872
And the week before?

18:10.915 --> 18:12.526
That's just his act.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.093
When he's not
in podcast mode,

18:14.136 --> 18:17.270
he's just Tom,
and he's really sweet.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.793
Can you let us
in, please?

18:18.836 --> 18:20.490
Yeah.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.060
Only a wack job
would think about moving a team

18:25.104 --> 18:28.324
from New York City to
a desert wasteland like Vegas.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.805
If someone ran her off the road
like the cops suspect...

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
Tommy.
...you don't
give them jail time.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.548
You give them
a ticker-tape parade.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.419
Tommy!Oh, what the frick?

18:36.463 --> 18:38.508
Tawny, you're gonna
mess up my tracks.

18:38.552 --> 18:39.857
No, we are.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.424
How did you get into

18:41.468 --> 18:42.599
Abby Wright's
party yesterday?

18:42.643 --> 18:44.645
Since we know you're
not a waiter.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.734
What did you do, Tom

18:46.777 --> 18:49.650
Uh, I paid a guy a few bucks
to borrow his waiter uniform.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.434
TAWNY: You actually
went through with that?

18:51.478 --> 18:52.914
I thought you were joking.I-I just wanted

18:52.957 --> 18:56.700
to ask Abby Wrong
a few questions for my podcast.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.485
Catch her off guard,
record her lies.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.313
The fans deserve
to hear from her.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.923
Is that why you followed
her in your car

19:01.966 --> 19:03.664
and tried to force
her off the road?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.970
What? What do I look like,
a psychopath?

19:06.014 --> 19:07.929
DYLAN: If the podcast fits.TOMAHAWK: Okay, look,

19:07.972 --> 19:09.583
just because I said I
thought she should die

19:09.626 --> 19:10.845
doesn't mean I
wanted her dead.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.542
We found pieces of
your rear marker light

19:12.586 --> 19:14.327
in the wheel well
of her SUV.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.938
That's who hit me!DYLAN: You think
Abby Wright swiped you?

19:16.981 --> 19:18.853
Where were you parked?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.637
99th and Lex.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.379
Don't go anywhere until we
check that out. Got it?

19:23.423 --> 19:24.772
Got it.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.514
Hey, is it too late

19:27.557 --> 19:28.689
to file a police report?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.822
I'm just saying, just
because she's dead

19:31.866 --> 19:32.954
doesn't mean her insurance

19:32.997 --> 19:34.085
shouldn't cover the damages.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.087
Uh-uh.
Mm-hmm.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.568
LIZZIE:
99th and Lex,

19:38.612 --> 19:40.179
parked where Tomahawk
said it was.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.137
DYLAN:
Oh, here's Abby.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.883
If she wasn't drunk, what was
making her drive like that?

19:48.926 --> 19:51.102
Hey, Jazz, Tomahawk
was telling the truth.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.975
We just saw Abby
sideswipe three cars.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.542
You're kidding.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.500
JASMINE: Is that Abby?LIZZIE: Yes.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.241
She's going back
the same way she came.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.112
Wait. Where'd that guy
come from?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.552
Get the plate number.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.905
The car belongs to Uri Minkus.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.602
JASMINE:
Oh, my God.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.909
That's him.That's who?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.911
The guy I was talking about,
outside the party.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.913
The one with a gun.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.786
WOMAN: And breathe into
a strong Warrior Two.

20:22.830 --> 20:26.703
Stretch forward,
and into Triangle. Look up.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.272
I thought I asked you
to come later.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.708
I'm on a job.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.276
I'm sorry if our trying
to find a killer

20:34.320 --> 20:36.278
interrupts your spandex safari.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.280
Why were you following
Abby Wright?

20:38.324 --> 20:39.977
That's what her husband
hired me to do.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.416
Russell Wright hired you?

20:43.459 --> 20:44.634
Yes.
LIZZIE:
To chase his wife

20:44.678 --> 20:45.679
to her death?

20:46.984 --> 20:48.725
I stopped following her

20:48.769 --> 20:50.640
long before she drove
off the bridge.

20:50.684 --> 20:54.514
I got stuck behind some moron
who didn't have his E-ZPass.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.125
Why did Russell Wright
hire you to follow Abby?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.170
He didn't say. I didn't care.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.434
It's not my job to find out why.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.436
Now, if you don't mind,
the class is over.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.787
I need to get moving
on my new job.Namaste.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.793
The P.I.'s story
checked out.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.969
Camera at the toll plaza
shows him getting jammed up

21:15.012 --> 21:16.579
in the E-ZPass lane.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.711
So we're at
another dead end.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.366
Damn it!
Abby called 911,

21:20.409 --> 21:22.193
terrified that someone
was trying to kill her,

21:22.237 --> 21:24.935
and then she drives off
a bridge, and we are nowhere.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.721
If it wasn't the podcast guy
or the gun-toting P.I.,

21:27.764 --> 21:29.549
then who was it?I don't know.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.115
Yet. I'm sorry.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.206
Abby needs me,
and I'm failing her.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.383
No. I know things
aren't happening

21:37.426 --> 21:40.386
as quickly as we'd like,
but we'll get there.

21:41.909 --> 21:46.653
Russell asked me to speak
at Abby's memorial service.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.785
Reliving all of those
childhood memories,

21:48.829 --> 21:50.657
I should be sad.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.268
But I can't get past angry.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.878
We're gonna find who did it.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.924
I promise.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.542
Anything in the hate mail?

22:06.586 --> 22:07.761
Not yet.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.153
I finished going
through Abby's phone.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.546
That 212 number--

22:10.590 --> 22:12.200
no record of Abby
calling it before.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.681
Can someone run a dump
on their house phone?

22:14.724 --> 22:15.682
On it.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.119
What 212 number?
Right here.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.294
LIZZIE:
It's the number
Abby dialed

22:19.338 --> 22:20.339
right before leaving the party.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.949
This makes no sense.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.864
Her mother's been dead
for years.

22:23.907 --> 22:27.215
Her mother?This was Abby's home
number growing up.

22:27.258 --> 22:30.305
I probably dialed it 60 times
a day when we were kids.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.482
You said Abby was in a state of
anxiety when you saw her last.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.919
Yeah, I saw her for a few
minutes when she went inside.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.617
She was a lot calmer,

22:37.660 --> 22:39.401
and then she asked me
and Russell

22:39.445 --> 22:41.011
to give her a few minutes alone.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.884
I'll be in my office
if anything comes to you.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.542
Needham.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.761
Oh, good. You?

22:51.805 --> 22:53.415
Oh, it's fine.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.852
Shen Downtown?
Yeah, I know it.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.812
Me, too. Bye.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.596
Shen, huh?
Hmm?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.381
What happened there?
Pad Thai massacre?

23:02.424 --> 23:03.947
Dim sum execution?

23:03.991 --> 23:05.819
SOSA: My finely honed
detective skills tell me

23:05.862 --> 23:09.257
that Detective Needham
has a date.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.999
A date! It's about time.SOSA: Ooh!

23:12.042 --> 23:13.914
Good for you, Lizzie.It's not a big deal.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.306
This case is my
top priority.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.134
I can cancel.

23:17.178 --> 23:20.007
I didn't find the 212 number
in the house phone records,

23:20.050 --> 23:22.444
but there was a 911 call
from seven weeks ago.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.924
Found a police report.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.142
The Wrights had a break-in.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.927
Russell didn't mention that.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.145
Or the P.I.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.321
What was taken?Not a thing.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.149
The housekeeper, uh,
Sofia Gutierrez, called it in.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.021
The Wrights asked the
cops not to pursue it.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.849
You talked to the housekeeper?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.677
Responding officers didn't
even get to talk to her.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.809
By the time they got to
the scene, she was gone.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.812
Never came back to work--
after eight years of service.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.120
RUSSELL:
Our housekeeper, Sofia.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.514
Yeah, that whole
thing was bizarre.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.167
Did you not pursue it
because you...

23:50.211 --> 23:52.518
you were protecting her

23:52.561 --> 23:56.478
A few of Abby's, uh,
knickknacks were missing.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.567
Um, Sofia's undocumented.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.874
She has kids.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.266
If she was desperate
enough to steal,

24:02.310 --> 24:04.094
we didn't want to make her life
any harder.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.400
How much were
they worth?

24:05.444 --> 24:06.793
Uh, I don't know.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.359
Thousand dollars, tops.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.926
What about the P.I. you hired

24:09.970 --> 24:11.885
to follow your wife?

24:11.928 --> 24:15.541
I would have mentioned it,
but he didn't see anything.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.935
But you did hire Uri Minkus
to follow your wife?

24:18.979 --> 24:21.634
Yes.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.766
But not to spy on Abby.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.289
To... to protect her.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.467
The threats against Abby
were getting out of hand,

24:28.510 --> 24:29.685
and she didn't want
a bodyguard.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.818
I was scared for her.

24:31.861 --> 24:34.951
I didn't know how else
to keep my wife safe.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.650
You need to tell us
these things, please.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.608
I'm sorry.
I'm not thinking straight.

24:39.652 --> 24:42.045
I-I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.439
We're gonna need that
housekeeper's information.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.702
Uh... but please don't do
anything to Sofia.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.052
She's a, uh...
she's a good person.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.619
We just want to
talk to her.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.057
DYLAN:
Why would a housekeeper

24:54.101 --> 24:56.495
put eight years
in a secure job in jeopardy

24:56.538 --> 24:58.192
for less than
a thousand dollars?

24:58.235 --> 25:00.629
Maybe she needed the money ASAP.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.458
Hi. I'm Detective
Needham.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.025
This is my partner.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.679
We need to talk
with Sofia.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.202
She's not here.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.290
Where can we find her?

25:09.333 --> 25:10.770
It's important.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.903
We need to speak to her
about Abby Wright.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.775
Uh, uh...

25:15.818 --> 25:17.907
my daughter's gone forever.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.953
What do you mean, "gone"?
Is she still alive?

25:19.996 --> 25:22.303
Uh, she's gone back
to El Salvador.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.565
When did she leave?

25:23.609 --> 25:25.306
Uh...

25:25.349 --> 25:26.960
about two weeks ago.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.352
"About"?

25:28.396 --> 25:29.919
You don't know the exact day

25:29.963 --> 25:31.312
your daughter
left the country?

25:31.355 --> 25:33.314
She's not really gone, is she?

25:33.357 --> 25:34.750
Go away, please.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.056
They'll find out.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.057
Who's "they"?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.538
Please go!

25:50.157 --> 25:52.072
Thanks.The housekeeper's
mother couldn't

25:52.115 --> 25:53.943
get rid of us fast enough.
She was terrified.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.205
So the housekeeper's
in the wind.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.946
Do we have
a photo I.D. of her?

25:56.990 --> 25:58.992
No, but we're trying to
get a photo from Russell,

25:59.035 --> 26:00.907
and we have a few unis
canvassing her neighborhood.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.517
Somebody always
knows something.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.563
Find her. We need
to know what she knows.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.390
We also need to know
what you know.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.566
Excuse me?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.393
You and Abby were friends.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.527
She had a dynamic reputation,
but in the last year,

26:12.571 --> 26:15.486
she decides to move a beloved
New York sports franchise,

26:15.530 --> 26:18.751
she causes a scene
and bolts out of her own party,

26:18.794 --> 26:20.187
her housekeeper disappears.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.406
Is that typical
of the person you knew?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.887
No, until you consider
all the stress she'd been under.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.410
How well did you know Abby?

26:26.454 --> 26:27.542
Are you interrogating
Lieutenant Gooden?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.283
It's fine.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.894
If it leads to somewhere,
I'm happy to talk.

26:31.938 --> 26:35.202
We were tight as kids.

26:35.245 --> 26:39.380
We didn't get together a lot
these last few years,

26:39.423 --> 26:42.426
but when we did,
we just clicked.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.298
Like no time had passed.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.126
What happened
those past few years?

26:46.169 --> 26:47.518
She'd been busier.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.564
Stressed, a little less focused.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.740
She didn't return
my e-mails as much.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.875
And I guess she was
a little more guarded,

26:55.918 --> 26:59.356
but again,
the press was hounding her 24-7.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.880
I'm sure I'd be the same way.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.185
What way was that?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.493
Different.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.191
Can you make a statement?Abby, have you come
to an agreement?

27:08.235 --> 27:10.019
After several rounds
of challenging negotiations,

27:10.063 --> 27:13.414
our games will continue to be
aired on the Hudsons Network

27:13.457 --> 27:15.416
without an added cost
to subscribers.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.636
This is a great way
to start the season.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.246
Go, Hudsons.That was three
years ago,

27:19.289 --> 27:21.074
around the time
that Jasmine says

27:21.117 --> 27:22.597
they started hanging
out less frequently.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.033
Confident, commanding.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.556
Nothing stands out.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.428
Try something more recent.

27:27.471 --> 27:30.692
Uh, two years ago,
after they won the second round.

27:30.736 --> 27:34.522
Yes, this is a big win, but we
still have two rounds to go.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.090
MAN:
We won, Abby!

27:37.133 --> 27:39.527
Have some champagne!

27:39.570 --> 27:41.660
Can somebody get me a towel?

27:41.703 --> 27:43.662
She's on edge, agitated.

27:43.705 --> 27:47.535
Seems odd after a playoff win.

27:47.578 --> 27:50.581
One month ago,
owner's conference.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.149
Fans are guaranteed
to see their team play.

27:53.193 --> 27:56.500
They are not, howev... uh...

27:56.544 --> 27:58.720
She's a shadow
of herself.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.461
Withdrawn, camera-shy.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.636
Different.ABBY: But we cannot promise

28:01.680 --> 28:02.637
that certain players will play.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.508
That is at the dissection...

28:04.552 --> 28:06.467
the-the dissec...

28:06.510 --> 28:09.296
the discretion
of the head coach.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.038
Did you see that hand tremor?

28:12.081 --> 28:13.692
Easily agitated.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.519
Physical tremors.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.696
Difficulty speaking.
Do you think it's possible

28:17.739 --> 28:19.654
Abby was ill
and didn't tell anyone?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.786
Not even her husband?

28:20.829 --> 28:23.223
I'll request
her medical records.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.181
:
Uh...

28:25.225 --> 28:26.922
in the meantime,

28:26.966 --> 28:28.837
any other theories?

28:30.230 --> 28:31.753
You're asking me
for more theories?

28:31.797 --> 28:33.668
You're normally begging me
to keep them to myself.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.539
Maybe I gave your theories
short shrift.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.367
Tell me, what else
could cause Abby's behavior,

28:37.411 --> 28:38.586
apart from illness?

28:38.629 --> 28:40.153
Well, sustained stress

28:40.196 --> 28:43.330
can lead to hormonal
and physiologic...

28:44.418 --> 28:45.767
Oh, oh.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.377
Very clever.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.683
What?
You're stalling.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.467
You think, if you get
caught up at work,

28:50.511 --> 28:52.556
you can use it as an excuse
not to go on your date.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.603
Frankly, I am insulted that you
think I would fall for that.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.865
I'm not stalling.
It's just a date.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.693
I can do it anytime.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.564
And we need to get
Abby's medical records tonight.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.958
Not to mention, we still haven't
found that housekeeper.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.786
We'll put in the request.
And we got unis

29:04.830 --> 29:06.527
canvassing the housekeeper's
neighborhood in Queens.

29:06.570 --> 29:09.660
It's about time you got back
in the game, Needham.

29:09.704 --> 29:10.966
Take it easy on him.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.620
And maybe use some
of that stuff

29:12.663 --> 29:14.796
that makes your lips
look fat.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.624
Oh, yeah, 'cause I
really want to look

29:16.667 --> 29:17.930
like your favorite
blow-up doll.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.714
Oh...
If he tries to kiss you
good night,

29:19.758 --> 29:20.715
maybe don't knee him
in the groin.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.326
Ooh.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.241
Nothing from you, Doc?

29:26.460 --> 29:27.766
Just be yourself.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.640
Only less uptight.

29:33.684 --> 29:34.773
Thanks.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.949
I'll do my best.

29:36.992 --> 29:39.647
But the rapids in Costa Rica
were my favorite.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.388
You ever been
white

29:41.431 --> 29:43.433
No. Sounds fun, though.

29:43.477 --> 29:44.913
Well, what'd you do
for your last vacation?

29:44.957 --> 29:48.308
Uh, it's been a while
since I've had a vacation.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.397
I-I work a lot.
Okay.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.921
So, what do you do for fun?

29:52.965 --> 29:55.837
For fun? I'm... not sure.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.623
Um, work. I'm sorry.

29:59.667 --> 30:02.583
My, um, dating small talk
muscle is a bit rusty.

30:02.626 --> 30:03.714
It-it's okay.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.325
There's no pressure.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.588
And that wasn't small talk.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.807
Hmm?

30:08.850 --> 30:10.330
Kidding.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.985
Our signature roll,
on the house.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.856
Thanks. Thank you.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.166
You don't eat sushi?

30:20.209 --> 30:22.168
Are... are you vegan?
I should've asked.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.865
No, I love sushi.
I... It's, uh...

30:23.909 --> 30:25.693
Well, I used to. Um...

30:25.736 --> 30:27.434
There's a story behind that.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.001
No, just, uh...

30:29.044 --> 30:30.176
It's-it's something
that happened at work.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.612
Never mind. Um...

30:31.655 --> 30:34.136
I would love
to hear about your job.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.964
What happened?

30:36.008 --> 30:39.576
[indistinct broadcast;
crowd cheering]

30:39.620 --> 30:41.796
DYLAN:
Take it to the hole!

30:44.712 --> 30:47.193
What is a Brahms-loving
guy like you

30:47.236 --> 30:49.935
doing in a "misplaced
aggression" joint like this?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.197
More work?

30:51.240 --> 30:53.068
No. Well, yes.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.853
Relationship work.

30:56.289 --> 30:59.683
For starters, I have
brushed up on my basketball.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.816
Or "b-ball," if you will.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.862
Yeah, suck it, New York!

31:05.864 --> 31:08.301
Brave guy.Yeah, or stupid.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.130
Andy, I am so sorry
about what I said before.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.262
It hurts my brain
that I can understand you

31:13.306 --> 31:15.612
on an intellectual level
but not an emotional one.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.701
Maybe that's okay.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.052
You know, a little mystery
can be a good thing, and...

31:20.095 --> 31:21.792
I can't have this argument
with you

31:21.836 --> 31:23.142
every time there's a game on.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.708
I know, it's just that
when I think

31:24.752 --> 31:27.059
about how sports is such
a big part of your life,

31:27.102 --> 31:29.104
I feel...
Embarrassed?

31:29.148 --> 31:31.715
Look, I know I'm
not as smart as...Jealous.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.327
Growing up,
I needed to believe

31:34.370 --> 31:37.504
that sports
were a waste of time.

31:37.547 --> 31:38.940
I was the awkward kid.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.550
You? No.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.946
I never got picked
for any teams.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.121
Hey.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.864
I picked you for my team.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.610
Oh!
: Oh, my God!

31:56.653 --> 31:59.743
Ow. Look, just be
yourself, okay?

31:59.787 --> 32:02.007
These guys aren't too picky.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.835
Just, uh, maybe lose the hat.

32:04.879 --> 32:05.967
Wrong team?

32:06.011 --> 32:08.665
No, no, you-you look ridiculous.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.842
Thank God.All right.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.977
LIZZIE: Oh, this
was a sex worker

32:16.021 --> 32:17.979
that a guy set on fire.
Total meth head.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.850
Have you ever tried
to have a conversation

32:19.894 --> 32:20.982
with someone high on meth?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.636
Can't say that I have.

32:22.679 --> 32:23.942
How's your food?

32:23.985 --> 32:26.205
Oh, good. Uh...

32:26.248 --> 32:29.556
Oh, this guy, he was shot
at point-blank range.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.862
Have you ever seen into
a human head like that?

32:31.906 --> 32:32.951
You're not hungry?

32:32.994 --> 32:34.430
Huh? Oh, no, no.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.736
It's great.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.259
Oh, sorry.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.566
Taru. That's a Finnish name.

32:39.609 --> 32:40.871
Isn't it?

32:40.915 --> 32:42.351
Oh, TARU's not a person.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.005
It's the Technical
Assistance Response Unit.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.703
Think of them as like the
computer nerds of the NYPD.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.532
Sorry. Last one, I promise.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.884
Lizzie, your head clearly
isn't here right now,

32:53.928 --> 32:56.539
and I don't want to hold you
back from your work.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.411
No, I'm fine, really.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.071
Let's call it a night.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.902
[crowd cheering;
indistinct broadcast]

33:14.383 --> 33:15.819
Do you mind?

33:15.863 --> 33:16.951
Did you just push me?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.126
Let it go, Justin.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.475
You're missing the game.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.434
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Damn it.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.001
Hey, ref! Go back
to Foot Locker!

33:23.044 --> 33:24.045
While you're there,
pick up some knee pads.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.786
You're blowing the game.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.657
Contact was initiated
before his feet were set.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.007
The foul was defensive,
not offensive.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.617
The ref made
the right call.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.489
What's offensive is the
stupidity of you saying that.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.014
It's one game out of 82.MAN: And only 82.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.059
No way you guys
are making the playoffs.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.408
Hey, what'd you just say?

33:39.452 --> 33:40.844
Come on, say it to my face.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.020
I'll shorten it.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.108
New York sucks.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.373
Nah-uh. Not in my bar.

33:50.506 --> 33:51.681
Hey, hey, calm down.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.074
ANDY:
Relax, buddy.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.728
Relax, or you're
going out.

33:54.771 --> 33:55.859
All right.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.738
Hypoxia is oxygen starvation.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.393
It deprives the brain
of oxygen-rich blood.

34:07.436 --> 34:10.874
This can lead to confusion,
difficulty with speech

34:10.918 --> 34:13.181
and lack of coordination.

34:14.748 --> 34:17.403
MAN:
Hey, let him go.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.323
For the record,
they didn't start

34:24.366 --> 34:26.499
acting like zoo animals
until you got here.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.717
How's your head?

34:27.761 --> 34:29.719
My head's fine.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.982
It's Abby's we need to look at.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.729
You think Abby was suffering
from traumatic brain injury?

34:39.773 --> 34:41.818
The M.E. just confirmed it.Like what football players get?

34:41.862 --> 34:43.646
Uh-huh.
Did she have a history
of concussions?

34:43.690 --> 34:45.561
No, but she had
a history of odd behavior,

34:45.605 --> 34:47.433
difficulty
interpreting touch.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.304
That's why she had that
mini-meltdown at the party

34:49.348 --> 34:50.784
when everyone
was grabbing at her.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.003
Mm-hmm. She also
struggled with words,

34:53.047 --> 34:55.789
impulsiveness, aggression.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.619
She was being choked.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.795
You think someone
choked Abby at the party?

35:01.838 --> 35:03.449
Most likely before the party.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.756
And the week before that,
and the month before that.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.541
Russell was choking Abby?

35:08.584 --> 35:10.325
But there weren't
any bruises on her neck.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.022
You wouldn't see
any external bruising

35:12.066 --> 35:13.763
if she was choked with an arm.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.504
There's more surface area
spread across the skin,

35:15.548 --> 35:18.072
and so less direct pressure
on a single point.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.900
If Abby didn't die
from the car crash,

35:19.943 --> 35:21.206
it was only a
matter of time

35:21.249 --> 35:22.859
before she died
from her TBI.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.426
Russell killed her.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.949
You can't just come out
and say something like that.

35:25.993 --> 35:27.037
You have to be sure.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.778
She spent
last night at TARU.

35:28.822 --> 35:29.866
What happened to your date?

35:29.910 --> 35:30.954
She was more
interested

35:30.998 --> 35:32.521
in her phone than her date.

35:32.565 --> 35:33.914
Not exactly.

35:33.957 --> 35:34.915
TARU kept texting
with questions,

35:34.958 --> 35:36.569
so I went over
there to look

35:36.612 --> 35:38.875
through Abby's
phone and computer.

35:38.919 --> 35:41.443
Three years ago, Russell
installed malware on her laptop.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.315
Might be the reason she wasn't
answering your e-mails.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.664
She may never have got them.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.926
DYLAN:
He wanted to fracture

35:45.969 --> 35:47.884
her relationships
and spy on her.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.799
Control her.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.888
She was enduring his abuse
for years.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.107
I would have seen it.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.935
I wouldn't miss
something like this.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.893
Oh, Russell and Abby
worked very hard

35:56.937 --> 35:59.157
to keep it a secret-- for
very different reasons.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.334
I kept telling her that she
had the perfect husband.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.510
No wonder she
couldn't tell me.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.599
Her recent behavior
makes more sense now.

36:06.642 --> 36:09.254
Years of abuse,
feeling like a prisoner.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.560
It's probably why she thought
about moving her team.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.781
She was subconsciously trying
to escape from her own life.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.739
Same reason she called
her childhood number.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.480
She was safe back then.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.874
Just dialing it gave her
a moment of comfort.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.484
I also found
a bunch of texts

36:22.528 --> 36:24.617
between Abby
and her housekeeper.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.445
The number's not in service
anymore, but it seems

36:26.488 --> 36:28.011
like they really cared
for each other.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.752
JASMINE:
Then why stage
a break-in,

36:29.796 --> 36:31.928
steal from her and
then disappear?

36:33.626 --> 36:34.801
DYLAN: Why make a house
look disheveled?

36:36.542 --> 36:38.979
Unless it was already
disheveled.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.894
Unless you're trying
to cover it up.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.989
Maybe she didn't.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.948
Maybe there was
no break-in at all.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.994
Maybe Russell attacked Abby

36:54.037 --> 36:55.952
before they left
for work that day.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.563
LIZZIE:
And the housekeeper
called the cops,

36:57.606 --> 36:59.739
hoping they'd put it
together and help Abby.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.828
She double-crossed Russell
by calling the cops,

37:01.871 --> 37:04.004
which is why she knew
she could never come back.

37:04.047 --> 37:07.225
But what I don't understand
is what made Abby run

37:07.268 --> 37:08.922
from her own party.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.924
You said you and Russell
were the last people

37:10.967 --> 37:12.578
to see her before she left.

37:12.621 --> 37:16.016
Did he do or say anything
before you left Abby alone?

37:16.059 --> 37:17.583
Yeah, I heard part
of their conversation

37:17.626 --> 37:20.020
when I returned Abby's bracelet,
but it was benign.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.064
What exactly do you remember?

37:21.108 --> 37:23.415
She apologized for lashing out.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.199
He said it was
embarrassing for him

37:25.243 --> 37:27.027
and that they'd deal
with it at home.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.812
That's it.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.597
That's why she ran.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.859
That's no normal

37:32.902 --> 37:34.469
husband-wife
conversation.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.471
"Deal with it at home"?

37:36.515 --> 37:38.081
He was warning her.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.822
But if he attacked her
so many times before,

37:39.866 --> 37:40.954
then why run that day?

37:40.997 --> 37:42.999
How often does
a domestic abuse victim

37:43.043 --> 37:46.307
get a two-hour warning
before her next attack?

37:46.351 --> 37:49.484
Abby knew what was coming,
and she couldn't face it.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.095
We gotta get
this son of a bitch.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.620
I can't wait for the unis
to finish their canvassing.

37:54.663 --> 37:56.317
We have to find
that housekeeper now.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.974
LIZZIE:
Tell me where Sofia is.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.715
URI:
This feels a lot like blackmail.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.933
Your word, not mine.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.283
You're threatening
to arrest me

38:05.326 --> 38:06.675
if I don't give you
information.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.503
We have video of
you following Abby.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.027
She was driving recklessly
to get away from you.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.942
Criminally negligent
homicide is a felony.

38:12.986 --> 38:15.118
Look, you're reaching.

38:15.162 --> 38:17.033
I was nowhere near her
when she crashed.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.384
No jury will ever
convict me for that.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.994
Maybe, but do you really
want to spend

38:21.037 --> 38:23.257
a year in court
fighting the charges?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.867
You were Russell's fixer.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.347
We both know he threatened
that housekeeper.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.914
Just tell me where she is.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.961
Okay, I will tell you
where she is.

38:32.005 --> 38:35.269
But one day, I may need
some help from you.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.620
Okay, Don Corleone.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.014
LIZZIE:
I know Sofia is here.

38:41.057 --> 38:42.581
Please, I need to
speak with her.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.886
And I've already
told you no.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.192
We are a
sanctuary church.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.412
I don't care about
her legal status.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.022
I'm homicide, not ICE.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.285
I'm sorry, Detective.
It's too risky.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.591
Risky?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.027
Sofia is hiding out here

38:54.070 --> 38:56.029
because a man threatened
to have her deported.

38:56.072 --> 38:59.293
I'm here because I want
to arrest that man.

LIZZIE:
The housekeeper confirmed
it wasn't the first time

39:20.923 --> 39:22.969
she saw the Wrights'
house turned upside down.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.884
She called hoping the
cops would show up

39:24.927 --> 39:26.973
and figure out Russell
was hurting Abby.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.801
Just as you suspected.Gets better.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.716
She actually recorded
Russell yelling at Abby,

39:30.759 --> 39:34.110
but she was too afraid to use
it against him till now.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.419
Hi. Good news?

As a matter of fact, we do.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.815
You're under arrest
for the murder of Abby Wright.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.338
Is that a joke?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.948
Who is accusing me of murder?

39:45.992 --> 39:47.297
Abby.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.822
Or at least her body
is accusing you.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.955
You people are ridiculous.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.131
Her autopsy showed
that she was being choked

39:55.175 --> 39:56.829
over a long period of time.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.005
Which was slowly
destroying her brain.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.789
That's what caused her
to drive off that bridge.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.487
Uh-huh.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.532
Don't you touch me.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.927
I-I was nothing but good to her.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.103
She-she's the one
that acted out all the time.

40:10.146 --> 40:12.192
LIZZIE: You have the right
to remain silent.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.586
This is slander. My lawyer will
sue you for everything you got.

will be held against you

You think you
can do this to me?

40:18.938 --> 40:20.592
Or what?
You gonna hit me?

40:36.869 --> 40:38.653
Sorry to interrupt.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.568
Sorry?

40:40.612 --> 40:42.048
Thank God you're here.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.093
Take all the time you need.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.226
I'm gonna get some water.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.576
Let me call a doctor.

40:53.189 --> 40:54.800
Thanks.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.410
Why are you hitting
Sergeant Harris?

40:56.454 --> 40:59.195
He's the only one
who'll get in here with me.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.284
Brave and stupid.Did hell freeze over?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.286
You're wearing a sports jersey.
Who's Wilson?

41:03.330 --> 41:04.679
Andy. That's
his last name.

41:04.723 --> 41:06.202
He gave it to me.
Hmm.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.769
It's nice to be
part of a team.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.336
Oh, I'm so glad
you're finally focusing

41:09.379 --> 41:11.512
on your own love life instead
of interfering with mine.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.383
I'd love to get you
on the mat

41:13.427 --> 41:15.168
after pressuring me
to go on that date.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.561
Oh, come on.
That poor guy.

41:16.604 --> 41:17.997
You weren't there.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.216
It wasn't as bad as you think.I-I...

41:20.260 --> 41:23.089
I grossed him out.
I humiliated myself.

41:23.132 --> 41:26.179
You feel bad because you
care what he thinks.

41:26.222 --> 41:28.268
Right? And you
went out because

41:28.311 --> 41:31.227
deep down, you care about
having another relationship.

41:31.271 --> 41:34.013
And you acted the way you did
at the restaurant because...

41:34.056 --> 41:35.884
I care about making
a fool of myself?

41:35.928 --> 41:36.972
: Oh, maybe.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.540
The point is-- you care.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.368
And that means you're ready.

41:41.411 --> 41:43.239
To try at least.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.371
Maybe.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.155
There are a lot
of Russells out there.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.114
And there are a
lot of Andys, too.

41:48.157 --> 41:51.204
And do you think I would let
you get involved with a man

41:51.247 --> 41:53.162
before I had analyzed every
single aspect of his behavior?

41:53.206 --> 41:55.600
Oh, if that's supposed
to make me feel better...

41:55.643 --> 41:58.167
I am right about
Hot Mechanic. I am.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.256
Just... so just...
just call him.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.823
Apologize. Ask for
a second chance.

42:01.867 --> 42:03.172
Leave it alone.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.174
Lizzie, your whole life

42:05.218 --> 42:07.699
can't just be about work.You're wasting your energy.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.265
Why? Because you're
a workaholic?

42:09.309 --> 42:12.312
Nope. Because I already
called him and apologized.

42:12.355 --> 42:13.661
Wh You did?

42:13.705 --> 42:16.185
The kicker-- he thought
it was sexy that I, um...

42:16.229 --> 42:18.536
I'm passionate about my work,
and he just felt really bad

42:18.579 --> 42:20.102
that he was keeping me
from my job.

42:20.146 --> 42:21.321
No.We're going out tonight.

42:21.364 --> 42:22.409
What?

42:22.452 --> 42:23.497
Elizabeth Needham.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.498
Mm-hmm.

42:24.542 --> 42:25.630
Good for you.

42:25.673 --> 42:28.328
:
Not so uptight.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.243
Not at all.

42:30.286 --> 42:32.071
This time, though,
just, you know,

42:32.114 --> 42:34.116
keep the crime scene
photos to yourself.

42:35.335 --> 42:36.554
Ooh.

42:37.729 --> 42:39.469
It worked the first time.

42:39.513 --> 42:41.602
Everything works the first time.

42:41.646 --> 42:44.083
Ooh, that's good.
