WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:03.334
WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS

00:03.334 --> 00:07.308
THAT ARE GONNA REQUIRE
SERIOUS WORK.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.381
LYNETTE AND TOM STRUGGLED
WITH THEIR SEPARATION.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.383
MIKE HEARD A CONFESSION...

00:12.383 --> 00:14.345
I KILLED GABY'S STEPFATHER.

00:14.345 --> 00:16.047
AAH!
 UHH!

00:16.047 --> 00:18.049
AND ME AND THE GIRLS
HELPED COVER IT UP.

00:19.390 --> 00:23.394
THAT COULD CHANGE HIS LIFE
WITH SUSAN FOREVER.

00:23.394 --> 00:26.197
BREE SHOWED GABY THE NOTE...

00:26.197 --> 00:29.029
LET'S SAY SOMEONE KNOWS.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.201
I SAY UNTIL THEY TELL US
WHAT THEY WANT,

00:30.201 --> 00:32.162
WE JUST ACT LIKE
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

00:32.162 --> 00:36.067
AND DECIDED SHE NEEDED TO END
HER RELATIONSHIP

00:36.067 --> 00:37.368
WITH DETECTIVE VANCE.

00:37.368 --> 00:41.242
YOU KNOW, BREE, I WOULD HAVE
DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU.

00:43.244 --> 00:46.417
YOU HAVE MADE
A VERY BIG MISTAKE.

00:54.325 --> 00:56.327
(Mary Alice) IT'S OFTEN SAID
THAT CHILDREN LEARN

00:56.327 --> 01:01.192
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

01:01.192 --> 01:07.198
THEY LEARN TO FIND PEACEFUL
WAYS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT...

01:07.198 --> 01:11.442
TO MAKE SMART CHOICES
ABOUT NUTRITION...

01:11.442 --> 01:17.178
TO MASTER THE ART
OF CONVERSATION.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.411
BUT FOR GABRIELLE SOLIS,

01:20.411 --> 01:23.154
THE ART OF MORNING DROP-OFF...

01:23.154 --> 01:26.257
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
COME ON! LET'S GO!

01:26.257 --> 01:28.389
WAS SOMETHING
SHE'D NEVER LEARNED.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.191
(honks horn)

01:30.191 --> 01:32.423
YOU SLOW DOWN, PUSH THE KID OUT,
AND DRIVE OFF!

01:32.423 --> 01:35.126
WHY IS IT SO HARD?!

01:35.126 --> 01:37.298
YOU REALIZE I HAVE TO GO
TO THIS SCHOOL, RIGHT?

01:37.298 --> 01:40.201
OH, COME ON. I'M BEHIND
THE WHEELCHAIR KID?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.432
THAT'S IT, JUANITA. GET OUT.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.304
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TILL WE GET TO THE GREEN ZONE

01:43.304 --> 01:45.136
AND A VOLUNTEER OPENS THE DOOR.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.407
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST WEEK?

01:46.407 --> 01:49.210
YEAH, LAST WEEK I MADE IT
TO MY HOT STONE MASSAGE.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.411
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN,

01:50.411 --> 01:52.443
PRETEND LIKE YOU
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, AND RUN.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.319
(children laughing
and shouting playfully)

02:03.354 --> 02:05.426
(blows whistle) HOLD IT!

02:05.426 --> 02:07.258
OHH.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.463
(whirring)

02:12.463 --> 02:15.306
HI, DANA.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

02:15.306 --> 02:17.268
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
DIDN'T LEARN HER LESSON

02:17.268 --> 02:19.410
THE LAST TWO TIMES
SHE BROKE THE DROP-OFF RULES.

02:19.410 --> 02:22.313
THREE STRIKES, SOLIS.

02:22.313 --> 02:23.474
YOU'RE OUT.

02:23.474 --> 02:25.476
WH--HEY!

02:25.476 --> 02:27.278
I NEED THAT!

02:27.278 --> 02:29.280
YOUR DROP-OFF PRIVILEGES
HAVE BEEN REVOKED.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.282
FROM NOW ON, YOU'LL BE PARKING
IN THE "B" LOT

02:31.282 --> 02:33.224
AND WALKING JUANITA TO CLASS.
 (gasps) THE "B" LOT?

02:33.224 --> 02:36.187
THAT'S, LIKE, A MILE AWAY.
THESE DON'T WALK.

02:36.187 --> 02:39.530
THEY DO NOW.
 OH, YEAH? WELL,
WHO DIED AND MADE YOU BOSS?

02:39.530 --> 02:42.433
MARGARET FRYE. CANCER.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.435
OH. RIGHT. I STILL OWE
FOR THOSE FLOWERS.

02:44.435 --> 02:46.437
(horn honks)

02:46.437 --> 02:49.370
OH, RELAX, PAM! YOU'LL STILL
MAKE IT TO WEIGHT WATCHERS!

02:49.370 --> 02:51.202
PROBLEM HERE, DANA?

02:51.202 --> 02:52.503
OH, GREAT.
NOW THE PIPS ARE HERE.

02:52.503 --> 02:55.446
IT'S SOLIS AGAIN.
SHE'S HOLDING UP TRAFFIC.

02:55.446 --> 02:57.508
YEAH, AND I'M NOT MOVING TILL
YOU GIVE ME BACK MY PLACARD.

02:57.508 --> 03:00.451
(horn honks)
 OH, PAM, EAT A CARROT!

03:00.451 --> 03:02.313
TELL YOU WHAT.

03:02.313 --> 03:05.356
IF YOU CAN TAKE THE PLACARD
FROM ME, YOU CAN KEEP IT.

03:06.457 --> 03:09.460
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT A CHILD.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.492
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
THE SATISFACTION--

03:17.468 --> 03:19.330
OH!

03:19.330 --> 03:21.402
YOU KNOW WHAT, DANA? JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE HEAD OF P.T.A.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.334
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET
TO MAKE THE LAWS!

03:23.334 --> 03:26.477
OH, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU.
HERE AT OAKRIDGE, I AM THE LAW.

03:26.477 --> 03:31.211
YES, SOME OF
OUR MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS

03:31.211 --> 03:33.544
ARE LEARNED
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM.

03:33.544 --> 03:36.487
AND WHEN IT CAME
TO SCHOOL POLITICS,

03:36.487 --> 03:53.304
GABRIELLE'S EDUCATION
WAS JUST BEGINNING.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.336
WHEN IT CAME
TO HER SEPARATION,

03:55.336 --> 04:00.611
LYNETTE SCAVO WAS DETERMINED
TO DO EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.

04:00.611 --> 04:03.444
SHE MADE SURE
HER VISITATION DAYS

04:03.444 --> 04:06.347
WERE EVENLY DIVIDED.

04:06.347 --> 04:11.322
SHE KEPT PERFECT RECORDS
OF HER HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.

04:11.322 --> 04:16.327
SHE FOUND HEALTHY WAYS
TO RELIEVE HER STRESS.

04:16.327 --> 04:18.589
YES, LYNETTE WAS CONFIDENT

04:18.589 --> 04:21.462
HER BY-THE-BOOK APPROACH
WAS THE RIGHT ONE,

04:21.462 --> 04:25.596
SADLY, NOT EVERYONE WAS
ON THE SAME PAGE.

04:25.596 --> 04:28.369
WELL, LOOK WHO CLEANED OUT
THE SAD-SACK AISLE

04:28.369 --> 04:29.540
AT THE BOOKSTORE.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.343
AT LEAST YOUR DIVORCE IS GOOD
FOR THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.305
WE'RE NOT USING THE "D" WORD.

04:34.305 --> 04:35.606
IT'S A SEPARATION.

04:35.606 --> 04:39.510
TOM AND I ARE GOING TO
"HEAL THROUGH COUNSELING"

04:39.510 --> 04:43.354
SO WE CAN FIND
"A ROAD TO RECONNECTION"

04:43.354 --> 04:45.356
AND IF NOT,

04:45.356 --> 04:47.418
"MURDER
ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS."

04:47.418 --> 04:48.489
(car door opens)

04:49.620 --> 04:52.593
(sets book down)
 PENNY, YOUR DAD'S HERE!

04:52.593 --> 04:54.425
EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.296
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO WIN BACK
YOUR HUSBAND,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.569
WHY DO YOU DRESS LIKE YOU SELL
ORANGES BY THE FREEWAY?

04:58.569 --> 05:01.301
(door opens)
 (lisping) HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.603
I HAD TO STOP AT THE STORE,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.535
AND IT TOOK LONGER
THAN I EXPECTED.

05:04.535 --> 05:07.408
BECAUSE YOU
 TAWT YOU TAW A PUDDY TAT?

05:07.408 --> 05:10.310
HA HA.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.484
(normal voice)
IT'S JUST A TEETH WHITENER.

05:13.484 --> 05:15.516
TEETH WHITENING, HUH?

05:15.516 --> 05:18.318
AND UNLESS SWEAT SUITS
ARE THE NEW BUSINESS CASUAL,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.351
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE WORKING OUT, TOO.

05:20.351 --> 05:23.694
I'M TRYING. IT HELPS CHEER ME UP
WHEN THE KIDS AREN'T AROUND.

05:23.694 --> 05:25.526
(Penny) DADDY!
 HEY!

05:25.526 --> 05:27.598
OH!
 REMEMBER TO GET PARKER
AT PRACTICE.

05:27.598 --> 05:30.561
I LOVE YOU.
HAVE FUN AT YOUR DAD'S.
 I LOVE YOU. BYE.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.433
DRIVE SAFE.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.336
HMM.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.411
I'VE GOT A NEW BOOK TITLE
FOR YOU--

05:40.411 --> 05:42.643
"YOUR HUSBAND'S
BANGING SOMEBODY."

05:42.643 --> 05:44.615
WHAT?

05:44.615 --> 05:47.418
CHAPTER ONE--WHITE TEETH.

05:47.418 --> 05:49.480
CHAPTER TWO--WORKING OUT.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.483
CHAPTER THREE--THE NASTY.

05:52.483 --> 05:55.586
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF.

05:55.586 --> 05:57.357
OH, LYNETTE.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.730
I EXPECT YOU TO BE NAIVE ABOUT
HAIR, MAKEUP, AND FASHION,

05:59.730 --> 06:01.562
BUT ABOUT THIS?

06:01.562 --> 06:04.465
TRUST ME.
TOM HAS HOOKED UP.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.697
HE'S NOT. HE'S NOT.
IF HE WAS...

06:06.697 --> 06:08.539
DATING SOMEONE,

06:08.539 --> 06:10.441
HE WOULD TELL ME.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.644
HE WOULD.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.448
RIGHT?

06:35.666 --> 06:38.599
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
TOO SUSPICIOUS.
 (gasps) OH.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.671
I'M SORRY. JUST--
EVERY TIME I CHECK THE MAIL,

06:40.671 --> 06:43.474
I'M AFRAID IT'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE LETTERS.

06:43.474 --> 06:45.676
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS.
MAYBE WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS.

06:45.676 --> 06:47.407
PLEASE DON'T SAY "WOODS."

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
I'M JUST SAYING, IF SOMEONE
WAS TRYING TO BLACKMAIL US,

06:49.409 --> 06:50.641
THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT,

06:50.641 --> 06:52.483
SINCE THEY HAVEN'T ASKED
FOR MONEY OR ANYTHING.

06:52.483 --> 06:55.546
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?
DID THEY JUST DISAPPEAR?

06:55.546 --> 06:56.787
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

06:56.787 --> 06:58.719
NOW THAT CHUCK THE COP
IS OUT OF YOUR LIFE,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.551
SUSAN'S ACTING NORMAL,

07:00.551 --> 07:02.553
I THINK WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.594
(horn honks)

07:03.594 --> 07:06.457
OH, GOOD. HERE THEY ARE. HMM.

07:06.457 --> 07:09.560
OH, DANIELLE AND BENJAMIN.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.562
FUN. WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

07:11.562 --> 07:12.733
HER HUSBAND LEFT HER.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.765
UGH. OKAY.
WELL, I'D STAY AND SAY HI,

07:14.765 --> 07:18.739
BUT THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LOT
OF LISTENING AND SAD NODDING.

07:20.511 --> 07:22.713
OH, HONEY, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT YOU AND LEO.

07:22.713 --> 07:24.444
THANKS, MOM.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.746
NOT THAT I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.648
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.819
NEITHER DID THE MARRIAGE.

07:28.819 --> 07:31.582
SO HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

07:31.582 --> 07:34.485
MY HUSBAND LEFT ME.
IT SUCKS.

07:34.485 --> 07:36.487
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
THAT FEELS.

07:36.487 --> 07:38.829
YOU JUST GOT DUMPED
BY THAT COP, RIGHT?

07:38.829 --> 07:41.461
UM...

07:41.461 --> 07:43.594
ACTUALLY, I AM THE ONE
WHO ENDED IT WITH CHUCK.

07:43.594 --> 07:46.637
HE WANTED TO MARRY ME,
BOUGHT ME A RING,

07:46.637 --> 07:48.669
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.741
THIS WEEK...

07:51.802 --> 07:53.804
OR WEEKS IS ABOUT YOU.

07:53.804 --> 07:56.707
WE ARE GONNA MAKE A PLAN
TO PUT YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER.

07:56.707 --> 07:59.510
A PLAN?
MOM, THIS ALL JUST HAPPENED.

07:59.510 --> 08:02.713
GIVE ME A FEW DAYS
TO EAT ICE CREAM AND VEG OUT.

08:02.713 --> 08:05.686
OF COURSE, HONEY. I PROMISED
YOU ON YOUR WEDDING DAY

08:05.686 --> 08:08.559
THAT I WOULD BE HERE
WHEN HE LEFT YOU.

08:08.559 --> 08:10.661
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:10.661 --> 08:12.693
MAYBE WE'LL JUST CRASH
ON ANDREW'S FLOOR.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.665
WHAT?
THAT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.768
NOT AS BAD AS STAYING HERE
AND GETTING PICKED APART BY YOU.

08:17.768 --> 08:21.772
I PROMISE
I WON'T CRITICIZE YOU.

08:21.772 --> 08:23.804
BESIDES, IF YOU SLEEP
ON ANDREW'S FLOOR,

08:23.804 --> 08:25.606
YOU'LL NEED A TETANUS SHOT.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.879
WHAT? I SAID
I WOULDN'T CRITICIZEYOU.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.841
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

08:30.841 --> 08:32.883
(sighs)

08:43.624 --> 08:45.626
OKAY, I KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT

08:45.626 --> 08:46.797
I SAID YOU COULD TAKE
ALL THE TIME YOU NEED

08:46.797 --> 08:49.660
TO WORK THROUGH
WHAT CARLOS AND I TOLD YOU,

08:49.660 --> 08:50.831
BUT...

08:50.831 --> 08:53.764
WHILE YOU'RE TAKING
ALL THE TIME YOU NEED,

08:53.764 --> 08:56.536
YOU THINK YOU COULD MAYBE...

08:56.536 --> 08:58.538
TELL ME
THAT YOU STILL LOVE ME?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.711
I MEAN...

09:00.711 --> 09:02.743
IFYOU STILL LOVE ME?

09:05.746 --> 09:08.919
(sighs) THERE IS
NOTHING YOU COULD DO

09:08.919 --> 09:12.623
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
STOP LOVING YOU.

09:12.623 --> 09:15.886
MIKE, IT WAS SO HARD
TO KEEP THIS FROM YOU,

09:15.886 --> 09:17.888
LIKE, THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

09:17.888 --> 09:22.763
WELL, AT LEAST I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO DISTANT.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.934
AND TO BE HONEST,

09:23.934 --> 09:25.866
I'M KIND OF RELIEVED
YOU WEREN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.639
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW,

09:28.639 --> 09:30.841
I JUST WANT EVERYTHING
TO GO BACK TO NORMAL.

09:32.803 --> 09:35.706
(sighs) OKAY,
BUT I HOPE YOU REALIZE

09:35.706 --> 09:37.708
IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT EASY.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.783
TAKE IT FROM A GUY
WHO'S DONE THINGS LIKE THIS.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.785
THEY DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.718
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

09:47.718 --> 09:50.921
(sniffles) BUT I THINK
IF I FOCUS ON OTHER STUFF

09:50.921 --> 09:53.794
AND MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE,

09:53.794 --> 09:55.726
IT'LL BE OKAY.

09:55.726 --> 09:56.797
GREAT.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.801
ANDFIRST STEP?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.933
I'M TAKING A PAINTING CLASS
AT THE COLLEGE.

10:02.933 --> 10:05.736
IT'S BEING TAUGHT
BY ANDRE ZELLER.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.710
OKAY,
THAT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.812
IT'S LIKE I'M TAKING
A FOOTBALL CLASS

10:11.812 --> 10:13.784
FROM PEYTON MANNING.

10:13.784 --> 10:14.845
WHOA.

10:14.845 --> 10:15.916
(laughs)

10:15.916 --> 10:17.648
IT'S JUST WHAT I NEED.

10:17.648 --> 10:18.919
I THINK IT'LL BE A GREAT WAY

10:18.919 --> 10:20.821
TO TAKE MY MIND OFF
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.894
SO I'M GONNA GET
MY PORTFOLIO TOGETHER.

10:23.894 --> 10:26.626
MR. ZELLER HAS TO APPROVE
ALL HIS STUDENTS.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.659
NOT THAT I'M WORRIED.

10:28.659 --> 10:30.630
OH, AND, MIKE,

10:30.630 --> 10:33.633
FROM NOW ON, I SWEAR,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.836
NO MORE SECRETS BETWEEN US.

10:43.914 --> 10:45.746
IS THAT MY SCHOOL?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.848
THE TINY, LITTLE BUILDING
WAY DOWN THERE?

10:47.848 --> 10:50.751
IT WOULD'VE BEEN FASTER
IF WE JUST WALKED FROM HOME.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.652
(woman) HEY.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.984
FIRST TIME
IN THE "B" LOT, HUH?

10:55.926 --> 10:57.828
WELCOME.
 WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

10:57.828 --> 10:58.989
(scoffs) PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.692
I LET MY KID GET OUT OF THE CAR
BY HERSELF.

11:01.692 --> 11:03.964
OOH. DANA TAKE YOUR PLACARD?

11:03.964 --> 11:06.837
YEAH, BUT I'LL GET IT BACK
IN A DAY OR TWO.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.999
(laughs)
 (laughs) ARE YOU KIDDING?

11:08.999 --> 11:11.842
SHE'LL HAVE YOU IN HERE
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.944
WHAT?SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

11:13.944 --> 11:15.776
OH, YOU WANNA BET?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.008
I TOOK A CELL PHONE CALL
IN THE GREEN ZONE.

11:18.008 --> 11:19.910
THAT WAS TWO MONTHS AGO.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.813
MY KID HAD PEANUT BUTTER
CRACKERS IN HIS LUNCHBOX.

11:22.813 --> 11:24.755
I'M LOOKING AT FOUR TO SIX.

11:24.755 --> 11:25.916
THIS IS CRAZY.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.788
NO, THIS IS DANA.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.689
DANA "THE PAIN-A." PFFT!

11:29.689 --> 11:31.762
DANA "YOU BETTER NOT
COMPLAIN-A." (chuckles)

11:31.762 --> 11:33.924
DANA "POWER'S
DRIVING ME INSANE-A."

11:33.924 --> 11:36.897
OH, MY GOD. IS THIS
WHAT THE "B" LOT DOES TO YOU?

11:36.897 --> 11:39.970
THAT, FOUR KIDS,
AND THE FLASK IN HER PURSE.
 (exhales deeply)

11:39.970 --> 11:42.032
WELL, IF EVERYONE THINKS
SHE'S SUCH A PAIN-A,

11:42.032 --> 11:43.904
HOW'D SHE GET THE JOB?

11:43.904 --> 11:46.937
IT'S AN ELECTED POSITION.
WE VOTED FOR HER.

11:46.937 --> 11:49.880
WELL, NOT ME. I DON'T VOTE.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.982
ALL RIGHT,
WHEN'S THE NEXT P.T.A. MEETING?

11:51.982 --> 11:53.043
THERE'S ONE THURSDAY.

11:53.043 --> 11:56.787
OKAY. I SAY WE BAND TOGETHER,

11:56.787 --> 11:59.790
STORM THAT MEETING, AND GO
ALL "BRAVEHEART" ON DANA'S ASS.

11:59.790 --> 12:00.951
WHO'S WITH ME?

12:02.993 --> 12:05.055
YOU GUYS NOT SEEN "BRAVEHEART"?

12:05.055 --> 12:08.899
I KNOW IT'S AN OLD REFERENCE,
BUT THIS IS WHEN YOU GO, "YEAH!"

12:08.899 --> 12:10.861
(women, flatly) YEAH.

12:10.861 --> 12:12.062
OH, GOD. COME ON.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.765
IF EVERY FED-UP MOM
IN THIS "B" LOT SHOWS UP,

12:14.765 --> 12:17.007
WE CAN BREAK OUR SHACKLES,
GET OUR PLACARDS BACK.

12:17.007 --> 12:18.969
WE CAN--OH! THE MOVIE "300."

12:18.969 --> 12:21.772
(imitates Gerard Butler
as Leonidas) THIS IS SPARTA!

12:21.772 --> 12:23.073
(normal voice)
YOU'VE SEEN THAT, RIGHT?

12:23.073 --> 12:24.815
(women) YEAH!

12:24.815 --> 12:27.117
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU LADIES
THURSDAY.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.187
MM-HMM.

12:37.187 --> 12:38.989
THIS IS EXCELLENT WORK.

12:38.989 --> 12:42.062
THANK YOU, MR. ZELLER.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.134
NOW I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING--

12:44.134 --> 12:47.337
WHY DOES A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST
WHO CAN DO THIS

12:47.337 --> 12:49.269
WANT TO TAKE A PAINTING CLASS?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.271
(chuckles)
 THAT IS WHAT I'M THINKING.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.274
WELL, MAINLY BECAUSE
I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR WORK.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.307
THAT SERIES YOU DID
BASED ON DANTE'S "INFERNO,"

12:57.307 --> 13:01.251
THE ONE WITH THE GUY CHEWING
THE OTHER GUY'S HEAD OFF--

13:01.251 --> 13:03.213
I WISH I COULD PAINT
LIKE THAT.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.015
YOU'RE VERY KIND,

13:05.015 --> 13:06.386
BUT THEN AGAIN, LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE WITH THESE BUNNIES.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.318
UM, DO YOU START
WITH WATERCOLOR

13:08.318 --> 13:10.190
AND THEN OUTLINE
WITH RAPIDOGRAPH...

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
ACTUALLY,
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.294
I HAVE A VERY STEADY HAND.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.325
WELL, CLEARLY.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.297
(chuckles)
 MY COMPLIMENTS, MS. DELFINO.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.172
OH, THANK YOU.

13:22.172 --> 13:24.234
SO...

13:24.234 --> 13:26.136
OBVIOUSLY, I'M IN.

13:26.136 --> 13:28.408
NO. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE OUT.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.242
WHAT?

13:32.242 --> 13:34.184
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
YOU'RE A FINE ILLUSTRATOR,

13:34.184 --> 13:36.316
BUT THIS ISN'T
WHAT I CALL ART.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.189
EXCUSE ME, BUT MY PAINTINGS
HAVE BEEN IN DOZENS OF BOOKS,

13:39.189 --> 13:41.151
SOME OF THEM BESTSELLERS.

13:41.151 --> 13:45.095
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD
OF "DOCTOR PORCUPINE"?

13:45.095 --> 13:47.397
HE HAS A VERY PRICKLY
BEDSIDE MANNER. (chuckles)

13:47.397 --> 13:50.160
RIGHT. BUT SEE,
WHEN YOU SAY "ART,"

13:50.160 --> 13:52.062
YOU MEAN A HEDGEHOG
WITH A STETHOSCOPE,

13:52.062 --> 13:54.164
AND TO ME, ART MEANS
REACHING DOWN YOUR THROAT,

13:54.164 --> 13:57.337
TEARING YOUR GUTS OUT,
AND SMEARING IT ALL OVER CANVAS.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.141
ANGER, PASSION--
THAT'S WHAT INTERESTS ME.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.312
WELL, UH,

14:02.312 --> 14:05.275
"DOCTOR PORCUPINE LOSES
A PATIENT AND KILLS A HOOKER"

14:05.275 --> 14:07.317
DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RING
TO IT.

14:07.317 --> 14:10.150
I'M LOOKING FOR SERIOUS STUDENTS
OF THE MEDIUM.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.122
YOU'RE A BORED HOUSEWIFE
TRYING TO KILL TIME

14:12.122 --> 14:15.285
BETWEEN SPIN CLASS AND DRIVING
YOUR KID TO SOCCER PRACTICE.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.127
HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.389
UM, JUST BECAUSE
I'VE DONE CHILDREN'S BOOKS

14:19.389 --> 14:21.391
DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE.

14:21.391 --> 14:23.433
REALLY? DO YOU HAVE ANY WORK

14:23.433 --> 14:25.435
THAT REFLECTS
WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

14:25.435 --> 14:29.199
OF COURSE I DO.

14:29.199 --> 14:31.241
I'LL BRING IT IN TOMORROW.

14:33.343 --> 14:37.147
I WOULD BRING IT IN NOW,
BUT I HAVE TO PICK UP MY SON...

14:37.147 --> 14:38.378
FROM PRISON.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.381
(door opens and closes)

14:41.381 --> 14:44.184
(man)
IN 1985, MUSICIAN BOB GELDOF

14:44.184 --> 14:46.316
ORGANIZED A BENEFIT CONCERT
TO FIGHT FAMINE IN...

14:46.316 --> 14:47.487
THERE YOU ARE.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.489
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M SURPRISED.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.391
IT'S WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
THE LAST THREE DAYS.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.463
GUATEMALA. IT'S GUATEMALA!

14:53.463 --> 14:55.425
(woman) ETHIOPIA.
 LOSER.

14:55.425 --> 14:59.129
(man) ETHIOPIA IS CORRECT!
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.331
(turns off TV)
 WELL, GIVEN THAT YOU

15:01.331 --> 15:04.474
WON'T BE MAKING YOUR FORTUNE
OFF GAME SHOWS,

15:04.474 --> 15:07.307
PERHAPS IT'S TIME WE HAD
THAT TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.209
MOM, I'M STILL HEALING.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.440
MY MARRIAGE FELL APART.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.183
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW HOW THAT FEELS.

15:13.183 --> 15:15.285
YES, AND I SAT
IN THAT SAME CHAIR "HEALING"

15:15.285 --> 15:18.188
AND EVENTUALLY TURNED
INTO A RAGING ALCOHOLIC.

15:18.188 --> 15:19.389
OH, MAN.

15:19.389 --> 15:21.351
WINE SOUNDS REALLY GOOD
RIGHT NOW.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.523
WE SHOULD GET A BOTTLE.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.495
WHAT, YOU CAN'T
EVEN HAVE A SIP?

15:25.495 --> 15:27.427
NO! NOW YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT

15:27.427 --> 15:30.260
PUTTING YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER,
GETTING A JOB.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.262
YOU HAVE A SON TO CONSIDER.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.434
OH, JEEZ.

15:36.206 --> 15:37.407
(singsongy) I FOUND YOU!

15:37.407 --> 15:40.240
NOW GO HIDE,
AND WE'LL PLAY AGAIN!

15:41.541 --> 15:44.544
ONE, TWO, THREE...

15:44.544 --> 15:46.346
OKAY, THERE IS SOMETHING

15:46.346 --> 15:47.477
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT DOING.

15:47.477 --> 15:49.419
OH. WHAT JOB?

15:49.419 --> 15:51.451
RETAIL? WAITRESSING?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.384
BETTER. MY OWN BUSINESS.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.556
I DESIGNED
THIS EXERCISE EQUIPMENT,

15:56.556 --> 15:59.229
AND I THINK I COULD SELL IT
ON THE INTERNET.

15:59.229 --> 16:00.560
(chuckles)

16:00.560 --> 16:03.263
DANIELLE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT STARTING A BUSINESS?

16:03.263 --> 16:06.196
I ALREADY HAVE THE DESIGN,
AND I WROTE UP A BUSINESS PLAN.

16:06.196 --> 16:07.537
I THINK IT COULD REALLY WORK.

16:07.537 --> 16:11.201
ALL I NEED IS A LITTLE
SEED MONEY. SAY $5,000?

16:11.201 --> 16:12.442
$5,000?

16:12.442 --> 16:13.543
WELL, I NEED THE SUPPLIES,

16:13.543 --> 16:17.507
AND I HAVE TO RENT A PLACE
TO WORK OUT OF.

16:17.507 --> 16:21.381
I WILL GIVE YOU $500, AND YOU
CAN USE THE TEST KITCHEN.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.254
SERIOUSLY?

16:24.254 --> 16:26.556
MOM, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME.

16:26.556 --> 16:29.289
WELL, I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:29.289 --> 16:32.292
YOU ARE SETTING A WONDERFUL
EXAMPLE FOR BENJAMIN.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.564
OH, CRAP.

16:34.564 --> 16:36.566
READY OR NOT, HERE I COME!

16:40.470 --> 16:41.531
HEY.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.503
SORRY I'M LATE.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

16:43.503 --> 16:45.475
IF I HAVE MY LUNCH
WHILE WE GO OVER OUR SCHEDULES.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.237
THAT'S LUNCH?

16:47.237 --> 16:48.478
PROTEIN SHAKE.

16:48.478 --> 16:52.412
JUST TRYING TO STAY, UH,
LEAN AND MEAN.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.284
I DID THAT ONCE.

16:54.284 --> 16:56.316
ALL I GOT WAS MEAN.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.449
HEY, I HAD TO MOVE MY MEETING
TO WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

16:59.449 --> 17:01.251
THINK YOU CAN PICK UP
THE KIDS?

17:01.251 --> 17:03.323
I'LL COVER PENNY'S ORTHODONTIST
ON FRIDAY.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.396
SURE. AND SATURDAY,
PARKER HAS THAT BIRTHDAY.

17:06.396 --> 17:07.597
SINCE THAT'S YOUR DAY,

17:07.597 --> 17:10.530
YOU CAN HAVE HIM LONGER
ON SUNDAY, IF YOU WANT.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.332
GREAT. YEAH.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.463
OKAY.

17:13.463 --> 17:15.605
THAT IS EVERYTHING ON MY END.
YOU?

17:15.605 --> 17:19.439
UM, I HEARD BACK
FROM THAT COUPLES COUNSELOR.

17:19.439 --> 17:23.272
SHE CAN SQUEEZE US IN
THURSDAY AT 6:00.

17:23.272 --> 17:27.317
I MEAN, IF YOU STILL WANT
TO GO TO THERAPY.

17:27.317 --> 17:28.417
ABSOLUTELY.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.649
OH.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.422
I CAN MAKE THURSDAY WORK.

17:32.422 --> 17:35.385
GOOD.
I'LL BOOK THE APPOINTMENT.

17:35.385 --> 17:36.626
(cell phone rings, beep)

17:36.626 --> 17:39.529
HELLO?

17:39.529 --> 17:40.560
HEY.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.535
Y--HEY,
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.639
OKAY. O-OKAY.
HOLD--HOLD ON A SEC.

17:49.639 --> 17:51.641
UM, THIS IS A WORK THING.

17:51.641 --> 17:53.643
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED FROM ME?

17:53.643 --> 17:55.645
UH, NO.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.407
OKAY. OKAY.

17:57.407 --> 18:00.410
I WILL... SEE YOU THURSDAY.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.581
OKAY.

18:03.653 --> 18:07.417
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I, UH, I WAS IN...

18:15.265 --> 18:16.866
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, JILL.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.728
FOR BACK TO SCHOOL NIGHT
APPETIZERS,

18:18.728 --> 18:21.701
YOU'RE SUGGESTING PRETZELS?
WHAT ARE WE, A PUBLIC SCHOOL?

18:21.701 --> 18:23.133
(laughter)

18:23.133 --> 18:25.104
(lowered voice) HEY. SORRY.
 HEY.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.707
DID YOU GUYS KNOW THERE WAS
AN A.A. MEETING IN THE GYM?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.209
I SAT THROUGH FIVE
"I LEFT MY KID IN THE CAR

18:29.209 --> 18:30.740
WHILE DRINKING" STORIES

18:30.740 --> 18:32.742
BEFORE I REALIZED
I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE.

18:32.742 --> 18:33.813
DOUGHNUT?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.146
(Dana clears throat)

18:36.146 --> 18:38.148
GABRIELLE SOLIS.

18:38.148 --> 18:41.191
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
YOUR FIRSTEVERP.T.A. MEETING?

18:42.852 --> 18:47.257
SAME THING THAT BROUGHT
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS TO...

18:47.257 --> 18:48.858
WHEREVER THEY WENT

18:48.858 --> 18:51.301
WHEN ALL THAT CRAP HAPPENED
WITH ENGLAND--FREEDOM.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.303
FREEDOM?

18:53.303 --> 18:54.864
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:54.864 --> 18:57.267
FREEDOM TO OPPOSE
AN UNJUST RULER

18:57.267 --> 18:59.809
AND HER UNJUST
PLACARD-STEALING WAYS.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.742
WEARE HERE TO TELL YOU
YOUR REIGN OF TERROR IS OVER.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.143
RIGHT, GIRLS?

19:06.216 --> 19:08.218
GUYS, COME ON!

19:08.218 --> 19:11.181
MELISSA, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN

19:11.181 --> 19:14.153
ABOUT THE BLOOD BLISTER YOU GOT
HIKING FROM THE "B" LOT?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.886
AND YOU... OTHER WOMAN,

19:16.886 --> 19:18.888
YOU WERE 20 MINUTES LATE
TO YOUR MANICURE.

19:18.888 --> 19:20.260
SHOW 'EM YOUR HANDS.

19:21.831 --> 19:25.164
THIS CAN'T GO ON.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.766
SHE'S RIGHT.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.239
YEAH. TELL HER, GABY.

19:29.239 --> 19:31.771
ACCORDING
TO YOUR SACRED RULE BOOK,

19:31.771 --> 19:33.773
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS A SNORE FEST,

19:33.773 --> 19:36.306
A GROUP OF FIVE PARENTS
CAN SEEK A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE

19:36.306 --> 19:38.177
IN A PRESIDENT.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.784
SO... I GUESS WE'LL BE
TAKING THAT VOTE NOW.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.887
MELISSA, RACHEL...

19:47.887 --> 19:49.859
YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

19:54.864 --> 19:55.925
(gasps)

19:55.925 --> 19:58.328
(whispers) NO.
IT'S AN OBVIOUS BRIBE.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.900
WELL, IT WORKED.
 YEAH.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.332
WHAT?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.811
GUESS WE WON'T BE HAVING
THAT VOTE AFTER ALL.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.284
SO WHAT?
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO TO ME?

20:14.284 --> 20:16.886
I ALREADY PARK
IN THE "B" LOT.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.000
NICE, MOM.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.837
(buzzing)

20:39.309 --> 20:40.970
(singsongy) HELLO!

20:40.970 --> 20:44.844
MOM. I, UH, I ASKED YOU
NOT TO COME IN HERE.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.276
I AM NOT STAYING.
I JUST THOUGHT

20:46.276 --> 20:49.879
MY LITTLE ENTREPRENEURS
COULD USE SOME LEMONADE.

20:49.879 --> 20:52.021
SO...

20:52.021 --> 20:55.355
THIS IS IT,
THE BIG INTERNET START-UP.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.256
YES,
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

20:57.256 --> 21:01.331
AS SOON AS WE PUT UP THE SITE,
THEY STARTED SELLING LIKE CRAZY.

21:01.331 --> 21:02.892
OVER 200 OF 'EM.

21:02.892 --> 21:05.365
WELL, I STAND CORRECTED.
GOOD FOR YOU.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.998
SO HOW EXACTLY DOES
THIS EXERCISE EQUIPMENT WORK?

21:08.998 --> 21:11.871
UH, WELL, IT KIND OF
INCORPORATES PILATES

21:11.871 --> 21:13.403
AND STRETCHING.

21:13.403 --> 21:16.406
IT'S REALLY MORE
FOR SERIOUS ATHLETES.

21:16.406 --> 21:19.349
(telephone ringing)
 THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER ORDER.
I SHOULD GET THAT.

21:19.349 --> 21:21.881
BUT COULD YOU TAKE BENJAMIN
TO GO GET SOME LUNCH?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.883
OF COURSE. BENJY.

21:25.054 --> 21:28.017
(ring, beep)

21:28.017 --> 21:29.288
(door closes)

21:29.288 --> 21:30.890
HELLO. X-STASY SEX SWING.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.323
WE PUT THE SWING
BACK IN YOUR SEX LIFE.

21:33.323 --> 21:35.425
YES, IT CAN SUPPORT
UP TO 300 POUNDS.

21:35.425 --> 21:37.327
AND WE GUARANTEE
MAXIMUM PLEASURE

21:37.327 --> 21:39.899
FOR YOU AND YOUR PARTNER.

21:41.371 --> 21:44.303
READY?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.905
♪ TA-DA ♪

21:45.905 --> 21:47.306
IS THIS FOR ME?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.339
UNLESS YOU KNOW
ANOTHER PENNY SCAVO

21:49.339 --> 21:52.041
WITH AN INCREDIBLY
GENEROUS MOM.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.083
LOOK, IT EVEN HAS A CAMERA.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.945
COOL!

21:55.945 --> 21:57.387
BUT MY BIRTHDAY WAS
LAST MONTH.

21:57.387 --> 22:00.319
I KNOW, BUT THIS WAY,
WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR DAD'S,

22:00.319 --> 22:01.991
WE CAN VIDEO CHAT,

22:01.991 --> 22:04.053
LIKE, WHEN YOU NEED HELP
WITH HOMEWORK

22:04.053 --> 22:06.426
OR YOU'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE
WITH MATH.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.497
NO, I HAVEN'T.

22:07.497 --> 22:10.400
WELL, YOU MIGHT.
SO... BRING IT.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.001
OKAY?

22:13.363 --> 22:15.935
(tablet chirps)

22:19.068 --> 22:21.971
Hey, sweetie.
Long time no see.

22:21.971 --> 22:24.474
Mom, you just dropped me off.

22:24.474 --> 22:26.446
REALLY? IT FEELS LIKE FOREVER.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.379
The gum you gave me in the car
still has flavor.

22:29.379 --> 22:30.950
WELL, I MISS YOU.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.982
Actually, since you called,

22:32.982 --> 22:34.954
we're multiplying
mixed fractions,

22:34.954 --> 22:37.126
and I'm kind of--
 I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
CAN YOU MOVE YOUR HEAD?

22:37.126 --> 22:40.430
Uh, sure.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.392
So do I need
a common denominator?

22:42.392 --> 22:44.133
HONEY, THE SUN'S
CREATING A GLARE.

22:44.133 --> 22:46.966
WOULD YOU MIND TURNING
YOUR SCREEN JUST A SCOOCH?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.367
Okay.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.539
OOH.

22:49.539 --> 22:52.442
(chuckles)
DAD'S NEW PLACE LOOKS NICE.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.043
Yeah, it is.

22:54.043 --> 22:56.145
HEY! YOU KNOW
WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?

22:56.145 --> 22:59.048
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
A TOUR?

22:59.048 --> 23:02.111
JUST TURN YOUR TABLET AROUND
AND SCAN THE ROOM.

23:02.111 --> 23:04.383
(sighs)

23:04.383 --> 23:07.386
Oh, big-screen TV.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.389
There's a 9.0
on the predictability scale.

23:10.389 --> 23:15.064
EMPTY PIZZA BOX, DIRTY PLATE,
DIRTY GLASS.

23:15.064 --> 23:17.997
It's nice he's kept
the same decorating scheme.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.469
MY ARMS ARE GETTING TIRED.

23:19.469 --> 23:23.002
Little longer.
Think light thoughts.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.434
STOP. GO BACK.

23:24.434 --> 23:28.478
I WANT TO SEE YOUR DAD'S
NEW LOVELY... CURTAINS.

23:28.478 --> 23:31.010
(both speaking inaudibly)

23:31.010 --> 23:32.512
WOW.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.113
THEY'RE NICE.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.115
BUT THEY SEEM A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR HIM.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.419
WHO IS THAT?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.521
THAT'S CHLOE.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.123
SHE LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
SHE'S REALLY NICE.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.154
(scoffs)

23:45.154 --> 23:48.558
APPARENTLY.

23:48.558 --> 23:52.061
SO... IS CHLOE AROUND A LOT?

23:52.061 --> 23:53.503
Sometimes.

23:53.503 --> 23:55.505
She teaches
a Booty Burn Ballet class,

23:55.505 --> 23:58.568
so she's mostly
at the fitness center.

23:58.568 --> 24:01.440
Hey, Mom.
Dad's got black toilets.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.572
You wanna seethem?

24:02.572 --> 24:05.144
NO, THANKS.
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.547
Okay. So when I multiply
these fractions--

24:07.547 --> 24:10.119
OKAY, SWEETIE, I LOVE YOU.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.889
OH, THAT'S DIFFERENT.
 MM-HMM.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.761
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU?

24:21.761 --> 24:25.665
LONELINESS, ISOLATION,

24:25.665 --> 24:29.739
NOT LONG AGO, THIS TREE WAS
LUSH AND GREEN,

24:29.739 --> 24:32.542
BUT NOW IT'S, UH,
LOST ITS LEAVES,

24:32.542 --> 24:35.845
AND WINTER'S AHEAD.

24:35.845 --> 24:38.808
AND IT'S JUST DOING
WHAT IT CAN TO SURVIVE.

24:42.552 --> 24:45.685
SO LET ME GUESS--
YOU'RE THE TREE.

24:48.718 --> 24:50.690
OH, OKAY.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.823
YOU'RE... MOCKING ME AGAIN.

24:53.823 --> 24:55.625
WELL, GOOD-BYE.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.827
HOLD ON. WE'RE HAVING
AN ARTISTIC DIALOGUE HERE.

24:57.827 --> 24:59.799
I BET YOUR NIGHT
WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS--

24:59.799 --> 25:01.801
YOU WENT HOME
AND ASKED YOURSELF,

25:01.801 --> 25:04.604
"HOW DO I PROVE TO ANDRE ZELLER
THAT I'M DEEP?"

25:04.604 --> 25:05.835
(thud)

25:05.835 --> 25:07.837
SO YOU DUG DOWN
THROUGH THE CUPCAKES

25:07.837 --> 25:09.639
AND THE THROW PILLOWS

25:09.639 --> 25:11.581
AND THE ONCE-A-WEEK SEX
OF YOUR LIFE

25:11.581 --> 25:12.782
TO YOUR VERY CORE,

25:12.782 --> 25:16.646
AND YOU FOUND
THIS SAD LITTLE TREE.

25:16.646 --> 25:17.947
"AND IT'S SO PROFOUND

25:17.947 --> 25:20.590
"BECAUSE THE TREE'S LONELY,
JUST LIKE I AM

25:20.590 --> 25:22.892
NOW THAT 'OPRAH'S'
OFF THE AIR ."

25:25.725 --> 25:27.627
HOW DARE YOU.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.659
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

25:29.659 --> 25:31.801
WHAT'S TO KNOW?
YOU'RE SHALLOW,

25:31.801 --> 25:33.763
AND YOUR WORK IS SHALLOW,
AND GOD BLESS,

25:33.763 --> 25:35.965
BECAUSE IF I HAD YOUR LIFE,
I'D BE PAINTING BUNNIES, TOO.

25:35.965 --> 25:37.867
YOU WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE NICE AND PRETTY.

25:37.867 --> 25:40.670
YOU'RE AFRAID OF UGLY.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.772
YOU--YOU THINK
I'M AFRAID OF UGLY?

25:46.876 --> 25:48.648
YOU WANT UGLY?

25:48.648 --> 25:49.679
(cap clatters)

25:49.679 --> 25:50.920
THERE.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.852
THERE'S SOME UGLY FOR YOU.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.884
YOU WANT PASSION?

25:54.884 --> 25:56.856
WELL, HERE YOU GO.
THERE'S PASSION.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.689
PASSION ALL OVER THE PLACE.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.662
YOU KNOW, I AM NOT
SOME SHALLOW SOCCER MOM.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.893
I HAVE DONE THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE.

26:03.893 --> 26:06.696
I HAVE ANGER!

26:06.696 --> 26:08.698
AND I HAVE PAIN!

26:10.670 --> 26:13.803
I HAVE SECRETS IN ME
THAT I WISH...

26:13.803 --> 26:16.005
I COULD GET RID OF,
AND I CAN'T!

26:16.005 --> 26:19.649
(pants)

26:19.649 --> 26:22.812
IT'S FINE. YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU'VE
MADE YOUR MIND UP ABOUT ME.

26:22.812 --> 26:26.756
SO SCREW YOUR CLASS,
SCREW YOUR MEDIUM.

26:26.756 --> 26:28.918
SCREW YOU!

26:52.682 --> 26:53.913
WOW.

27:06.696 --> 27:08.027
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.930
HEY, DO YOU HAVE
A RECIPE FOR...

27:10.930 --> 27:12.001
OH.

27:12.001 --> 27:13.963
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:13.963 --> 27:15.835
FOR WHAT?

27:15.835 --> 27:18.808
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
AND CHUCK WERE BACK TOGETHER.

27:18.808 --> 27:20.810
WE'RE NOT.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.773
WELL, THEN WHY ARE
YOU WEARING A SEX SWING?

27:23.773 --> 27:24.774
A WHAT?

27:26.776 --> 27:29.779
OH, NO. THIS IS, UH,
DANIELLE'S NEW BUSINESS.

27:29.779 --> 27:33.052
SHE'S MAKING
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.784
UH, YEAH,

27:34.784 --> 27:38.858
FOR A VERY SPECIFICKIND
 OF EXERCISE.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.990
(gasps)

27:40.990 --> 27:44.734
SEX SWING?

27:44.734 --> 27:47.797
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

27:51.801 --> 27:54.844
NOW DON'T TRY THIS ONE
IF YOU GET DIZZY EASILY.

27:54.844 --> 27:55.845
OH!

27:55.845 --> 27:57.046
(Danielle) MOM?

27:57.046 --> 27:59.078
EXERCISE EQUIPMENT?

27:59.078 --> 28:02.812
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS,
YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!

28:02.812 --> 28:05.855
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK LATER.

28:05.855 --> 28:07.817
A SEX SWING
IN MY TEST KITCHEN?

28:07.817 --> 28:10.990
DO YOU REALIZE I USED TO MAKE
PEOPLE WEAR HAIRNETS IN HERE?

28:10.990 --> 28:14.924
DANIELLE, I AM
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

28:14.924 --> 28:16.866
GOSH, WHERE HAVE
I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

28:16.866 --> 28:19.799
OH, DON'T YOU TRY
TO TURN THIS AROUND ON ME!

28:19.799 --> 28:21.801
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

28:21.801 --> 28:24.073
I FOUND SOMETHING THAT I'M
GOOD AT AND THAT'S SUCCESSFUL,

28:24.073 --> 28:26.105
AND THAT'S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU!

28:26.105 --> 28:29.939
YOU JUST LIVE TO JUDGE ME.

28:29.939 --> 28:31.781
DANIELLE.

28:31.781 --> 28:33.012
DANIELLE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

28:34.113 --> 28:35.945
(door closes)

28:35.945 --> 28:38.918
NO, I'M TELLING YOU.
IT WAS BAD.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.890
ANDRE PROBABLY CALLED
THE LOONEY BIN,

28:40.890 --> 28:43.853
AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY HERE
RIGHT NOW WITH A BUTTERFLY NET.

28:43.853 --> 28:44.994
IT'S OKAY, BABE.

28:44.994 --> 28:47.927
NO, IT'S NOT.
I JUST RAN OUT OF THERE.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.130
I-I-I FORGOT MY PORTFOLIO.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.162
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
CAME OVER ME.

28:53.162 --> 28:56.135
SUSAN...

28:56.135 --> 28:58.107
I KNOW HOW BADLY YOU WANT

28:58.107 --> 29:00.109
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WOODS
TO GO AWAY,

29:00.109 --> 29:02.171
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

29:02.171 --> 29:04.013
IT'S NOT GOING TO.

29:04.013 --> 29:05.845
IT'S PART OF YOU.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.847
NO.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.148
N--MNH.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.180
I-I DON'T WANT IT TO BE.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.152
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE EITHER,

29:13.152 --> 29:15.024
JUST LIKE I DON'T WANT
MY DARK STUFF TO BE PART OF ME,

29:15.024 --> 29:17.857
BUT IT IS.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.189
(crying) MIKE, PLEASE.
PLEASE STOP SAYING THIS.

29:20.189 --> 29:24.063
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

29:24.063 --> 29:29.038
IF YOU CAN ACCEPT THIS
AS PART OF YOU,

29:29.038 --> 29:32.972
MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO LIVE WITH IT.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.975
BUT IF YOU DON'T,

29:35.975 --> 29:38.978
THAT'S WHEN IT JUMPS OUT
WITHOUT WARNING.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.182
AND TRUST ME,

29:43.182 --> 29:45.985
THAT'S A BAD WAY TO LIVE.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.994
SO...

29:54.994 --> 29:57.967
THINGS ARE NEVER GONNA BE
THE WAY THEY WERE?

29:57.967 --> 30:00.930
THINGS...

30:00.930 --> 30:03.873
ARE HOW THEY ARE.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.238
YOU OKAY?

30:09.238 --> 30:11.881
(M.J.) MOMMY, WILL YOU CHECK
MY MATH WORKSHEET?

30:11.881 --> 30:13.913
IT'S REALLY HARD.

30:15.945 --> 30:18.087
SURE. SURE, HONEY.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.128
(exhales deeply)

30:35.865 --> 30:38.537
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING
HOW I GOT HERE,

30:38.537 --> 30:41.871
THE U.P.S. MAN HEARD MY CRIES
AND CUT ME DOWN.

30:41.871 --> 30:45.544
SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
WE'RE FedEx PEOPLE NOW.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.047
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT I AM JUDGMENTAL.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.979
THINK?

30:49.979 --> 30:51.951
"DANIELLE, YOU SHOULD'VE
GONE TO COLLEGE."

30:51.951 --> 30:54.083
"DANIELLE, YOU DRESS LIKE
A STREETWALKER."

30:54.083 --> 30:57.056
"DANIELLE, I KNEW YOUR MARRIAGE
WOULDN'T LAST."

30:57.056 --> 30:59.628
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

30:59.628 --> 31:02.861
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.594
WHY ARE YOU ADMITTING THIS?

31:05.594 --> 31:07.536
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

31:07.536 --> 31:09.538
AND I REALIZE
I AM FAR FROM PERFECT.

31:09.538 --> 31:12.071
I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE SO CRITICAL.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.873
OKAY,
NOW YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.075
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

31:18.047 --> 31:21.650
JUST KNOW THAT
A CERTAIN RECENT... EVENT

31:21.650 --> 31:25.614
MADE ME AWARE THAT I AM
IN NO POSITION TO JUDGEYOU

31:25.614 --> 31:27.556
OR ANYONE ELSE.

31:27.556 --> 31:29.618
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:29.618 --> 31:31.921
(sighs) IT DOESN'T MATTER.

31:31.921 --> 31:33.892
THE POINT IS...

31:35.594 --> 31:37.566
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

31:37.566 --> 31:41.000
WOW.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.973
THAT'S, LIKE, THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER SAID THAT.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.107
THANK YOU. AND...

31:48.107 --> 31:50.909
YES, I FORGIVE YOU.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.642
AND TO PROVE
THAT I AM SINCERE,

31:53.642 --> 31:55.614
I WOULD LIKE TO INVEST
IN YOUR BUSINESS

31:55.614 --> 31:57.146
AND SUPPORT YOU IN MAKING

31:57.146 --> 32:01.120
THOSE DISGUSTING...LY
HAPPY SWINGS.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.592
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SILENT PARTNER?

32:03.592 --> 32:05.654
A SILENT, INVISIBLE,

32:05.654 --> 32:08.097
AND COMPLETELY UNTRACEABLE
PARTNER

32:08.097 --> 32:11.930
WHO SUPPORTS YOU
FROM FAR, FAR AWAY.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.602
(sighs)

32:13.602 --> 32:15.604
I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.

32:15.604 --> 32:16.966
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

32:16.966 --> 32:17.967
MM!

32:17.967 --> 32:20.939
(sighs)

32:20.939 --> 32:23.072
NOW... GO PACK UP
YOUR SEX FACTORY,

32:23.072 --> 32:26.015
AND I WILL BAKE US
SOME COOKIES.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.050
(sighs)

32:31.050 --> 32:34.083
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PAINT
A HUNDRED BAD PAINTINGS,

32:34.083 --> 32:36.055
SO LET'S GET THOSE
OUT OF THE WAY

32:36.055 --> 32:39.958
SO YOU CAN START PAINTING
THE GOOD ONES.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.061
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:42.061 --> 32:45.134
UH, I FORGOT MY PORTFOLIO.

32:45.134 --> 32:47.166
SIT DOWN.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.098
EXCUSE ME?

32:49.098 --> 32:50.739
SIT DOWN. YOU'RE LATE.

32:52.101 --> 32:54.143
UM...

32:54.143 --> 32:57.046
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE
LETTING ME JOIN THE CLASS?

32:57.046 --> 32:59.048
FOR NOW.

32:59.048 --> 33:02.711
BUT THAT WOMAN WHO SHOWED UP
YESTERDAY--THE CRAZY ONE--

33:02.711 --> 33:05.054
SHE BETTER BE HERE
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

33:05.054 --> 33:07.086
OH.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.758
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF I LIKE THAT WOMAN.

33:09.758 --> 33:11.220
SHE SCARES ME.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.722
GOOD.

33:15.224 --> 33:17.726
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO START

33:17.726 --> 33:20.669
BY FORGETTING EVERYTHING
YOU HEARD ABOUT BRUSH TECHNIQUE.

33:20.669 --> 33:22.201
I'VE SEEN YOUR PAINTING.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.033
EITHER YOU HEARD IT WRONG,

33:24.033 --> 33:26.075
OR ITWASWRONG.

33:27.736 --> 33:29.208
(sighs)

33:31.240 --> 33:33.142
HEY.
ARE YOU READY FOR OUR WALK?

33:33.142 --> 33:35.013
ACTUALLY, CHANGE OF PLANS.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.015
I THOUGHT WE'D GO
TO THAT BOOTY BURN BALLET CLASS

33:37.015 --> 33:39.748
AT THE FITNESS CENTER.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:39.748 --> 33:42.121
NOTHING. CAN'T A WOMAN
JUST WANNA BURN HER BOOTY?

33:44.053 --> 33:46.055
FINE. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT TOM SEEING SOMEONE.

33:46.055 --> 33:47.756
SHE'S AN AEROBICS TEACHER.

33:47.756 --> 33:51.029
(sighs) OF COURSE SHE IS.
CLICHE MUCH?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.702
SO I'M THINKING, I'LL GO
TO HER CLASS, AND I'LL--

33:53.702 --> 33:55.764
ACTUALLY, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I'M THINKING.

33:55.764 --> 33:58.036
YOU'RE THINKING
YOU WANNA SPY ON THIS WOMAN

33:58.036 --> 34:00.038
AND SEE WHAT SHE'S LIKE,
THEN KEY HER CAR ON THE WAY OUT.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.270
IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.772
SO I'M NOT CRAZY?
I SHOULDN'T JUST BE DIRECT

34:03.772 --> 34:05.274
AND ASK TOM
IF HE'S SEEING SOMEONE?

34:05.274 --> 34:06.775
WHY? SO HE CAN LIE TO YOU

34:06.775 --> 34:09.047
THROUGH
HIS UNNATURALLY WHITE TEETH?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.248
OKAY, THEN.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.050
I GUESS WE'RE GOING.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.083
YEAH.
UH, BOOTY BURN BALLET--

34:14.083 --> 34:15.724
THINK WE CAN DO THIS?

34:15.724 --> 34:17.786
OH, PLEASE.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

34:17.786 --> 34:19.257
(dance music playing)

34:19.257 --> 34:21.260
AM I THE ONLY ONE
ABOUT TO PASS OUT?

34:21.260 --> 34:24.132
NO. I KEEP SEEING
MY DEAD GRANDFATHER

34:24.132 --> 34:25.793
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL,

34:25.793 --> 34:28.065
SAYING
"COME TOWARD THE LIGHT."

34:28.065 --> 34:31.800
KEEP GOING, LADIES.
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE THIGHS!

34:31.800 --> 34:34.203
DID SHE JUST USE
A CIVIL RIGHTS RALLYING CRY

34:34.203 --> 34:36.775
TO GET US TO LOSE ASS FAT?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.206
FIRST TIME, HUH?

34:38.206 --> 34:40.208
OH, WHAT GAVE ME AWAY?

34:40.208 --> 34:43.212
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS
LIGHT BLUE WHEN I CAME IN?

34:43.212 --> 34:45.154
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

34:45.154 --> 34:47.216
IF YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK,
I'M A DOCTOR.

34:47.216 --> 34:50.289
THE BAD NEWS IS
IF YOU HAVE ONE, I'M NOT.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.860
OKAY, SO IF I DIE,

34:52.860 --> 34:55.164
PLEASE PUT ME ASS UP
IN THE COFFIN.

34:55.164 --> 34:57.226
I'D HATE FOR ALL THIS WORK
TO GO TO WASTE.

34:57.226 --> 34:58.297
(groans)
 (Chloe claps)

34:58.297 --> 34:59.798
ON YOUR FEET, LADIES.

34:59.798 --> 35:03.172
(panting) OKAY, WE'VE
CHECKED OUT THE COMPETITION.

35:03.172 --> 35:04.273
CAN WE GO NOW?

35:04.273 --> 35:05.274
NO.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.875
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.307
OKAY, EVERYBODY,

35:08.307 --> 35:11.810
TIME TO WORK THOSE QUADS.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.883
I DON'T KNOW WHO I HATE MORE
RIGHT NOW--YOU OR HER.

35:14.883 --> 35:16.245
50 LUNGES!

35:16.245 --> 35:18.847
JUMP TOWARDS
YOUR SKINNY, SKINNY FUTURE.

35:18.847 --> 35:21.150
AND WE HAVE A WINNER.

35:25.894 --> 35:27.326
HI. IT'S MRS. SOLIS.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.328
CAN YOU TELL SEAN I'M RUNNING
ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATE

35:29.328 --> 35:33.131
FOR MY BROW-WAXING APPOINTMENT?
 (shifts gears)

35:33.131 --> 35:35.264
WHAT?
YOU CAN'T HOLD IT FOR ME?

35:35.264 --> 35:39.168
BUT I'VE GOT CATERPILLARS
OVER MY EYES.

35:39.168 --> 35:41.170
FINE. I'LL BE THERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

35:41.170 --> 35:43.842
JUANITA,
GET BACK IN THE CAR.
 (door closes)

35:43.842 --> 35:46.175
WE'RE GOING DROP-OFF.

35:46.175 --> 35:48.217
(tires peal)

35:48.217 --> 35:51.220
(children shouting playfully)

35:55.224 --> 35:57.286
GABY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

35:57.286 --> 36:00.158
YOU CAN'T BE IN THE CARPOOL LANE
WITHOUT A PLACARD.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.391
DON'T GIVE A CRAP. IT'S TIME
SOMEBODY TAUGHT DANA A LESSON.

36:02.391 --> 36:04.863
WE NEED TO BREAK THE BACK
OF OUR OPPRESSOR.

36:13.302 --> 36:15.844
(blows whistle)
MOBILIZE THE CONES!

36:20.949 --> 36:22.281
(tires screech)

36:22.281 --> 36:25.214
GET OUT, SWEETIE. GO.
GO. GO, GO, GO!

36:32.291 --> 36:33.422
(gasps)

36:33.422 --> 36:37.195
(tires screech, thud)

36:37.195 --> 36:38.867
(sighs)

36:38.867 --> 36:41.370
I'M NEVER GONNA GET
THAT EYEBROW WAX.

36:47.806 --> 36:51.440
AGAIN, DANA, I AM SO SORRY.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.613
ON THE UPSIDE,
THAT CAST IS SO SLIMMING.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.446
IT'S LIKE A HARD SPANX.

36:57.446 --> 37:00.619
GABY, THERE'S A REASON
I ASKED TO SEE YOU.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.492
YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME
MY PLACARD BACK. (chuckles)

37:03.492 --> 37:07.726
NO. COULD YOU HAND ME
THOSE PAINKILLERS?

37:08.797 --> 37:10.829
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
UP TO DATE

37:10.829 --> 37:12.831
ON SOME SCHOOL-RELATED NEWS.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.603
GIVEN MY CONDITION,

37:14.603 --> 37:16.605
THEY'VE INFORMED ME
THAT I'M NO LONGER ABLE

37:16.605 --> 37:18.767
TO CARRY OUT MY DUTIES
AS P.T.A. PRESIDENT.

37:18.767 --> 37:21.570
THAT'S A BUMMER.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.512
YES, IT IS.

37:24.773 --> 37:28.617
THE BYLAWS STATE I'M TO
APPOINT AN ACTING PRESIDENT,

37:28.617 --> 37:30.819
AND I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

37:30.819 --> 37:33.822
ME?

37:33.822 --> 37:35.624
WAIT. YOU HATE ME.

37:35.624 --> 37:36.755
VERY PERCEPTIVE.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.628
THAT'LL SERVE YOU WELL
AS P.T.A. PRESIDENT.

37:39.628 --> 37:41.760
W--OKAY, WAIT.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.532
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

37:43.532 --> 37:46.765
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I WAS LIKE
BEFORE I TOOK THIS JOB.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.537
I WAS FUN.

37:48.537 --> 37:49.868
I DRANK AT SCHOOL FUNCTIONS.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.641
MY BOOB FELL OUT
AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY.

37:52.641 --> 37:54.773
I STILL HAD A HUSBAND.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.706
SO WHAT TURNED YOU
INTOTHIS?

37:57.706 --> 37:59.748
THE JOB DID. MM-HMM.

37:59.748 --> 38:02.511
AND IT'S GONNA DO THE SAME
TO YOU.

38:02.511 --> 38:03.712
YEAH, NO TIME FOR MANICURES

38:03.712 --> 38:06.715
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE PLANNING
THE WINTER GALA.

38:06.715 --> 38:08.817
NO MORE SEEING YOUR HUSBAND

38:08.817 --> 38:11.620
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ORGANIZING
THE BAKE SALE.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.791
AND NO MORE FRIENDS,

38:12.791 --> 38:15.864
BECAUSE YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
HITTING THEM UP FOR SOMETHING.

38:15.864 --> 38:19.798
WELL, AS ATTRACTIVE AS YOUR
LITTLE REVENGE FANTASY SOUNDS,

38:19.798 --> 38:21.630
I'M GONNA PASS.

38:21.630 --> 38:25.574
THEN I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GO AHEAD AND PRESS CHARGES.

38:25.574 --> 38:28.707
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.779
I HAVE WITNESSES

38:30.779 --> 38:34.683
WHO HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE
GOING TO BREAK MY BACK.

38:34.683 --> 38:37.746
(clenches teeth)
AND I DO HAVE A BROKEN BACK.

38:37.746 --> 38:38.787
(inhales deeply)

38:44.693 --> 38:48.627
SO THE WINTER GALA...
 (pills rattle)

38:48.627 --> 38:50.729
IT'S IN THE WINTER, RIGHT?

38:50.729 --> 38:52.761
(cap clicks)

38:52.761 --> 38:54.563
THAT'S INTERESTING.
INTERESTING.

38:54.563 --> 38:56.565
SO REALLY,
YOU HAVE THREE CAREERS.

38:56.565 --> 38:58.837
YOU'RE A AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR,
AROMATHERAPIST,

38:58.837 --> 39:00.869
AND A LINGERIE MODEL.

39:00.869 --> 39:03.772
WELL, LINGERIE MODELING IS
MORE OF A HOBBY THAN A CAREER.

39:03.772 --> 39:05.774
OH.
 BUT WHEN GOD GIVES YOU THESE...

39:05.774 --> 39:07.646
(chuckles) RIGHT.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.818
ARE YOU SURE GOD
GAVE YOU THOSE? (chuckles)

39:09.818 --> 39:11.580
I'M JUST KIDDING.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.682
I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S NICE TALKING TO YOU, CHLOE.

39:13.682 --> 39:14.853
READY TO GO?

39:14.853 --> 39:15.884
YES.

39:15.884 --> 39:17.586
SO?

39:17.586 --> 39:19.728
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I'M NOT THRILLED. LOOK AT HER.

39:19.728 --> 39:20.929
BUT IT COULD BE WORSE.

39:20.929 --> 39:22.761
HOW?

39:22.761 --> 39:24.593
SHE COULD LOOK LIKE THAT

39:24.593 --> 39:25.934
ANDHAVE A SINGLE THOUGHT
IN HER HEAD.

39:25.934 --> 39:28.597
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY
TOM'S EVER GONNA GET SERIOUS

39:28.597 --> 39:30.599
ABOUT A WOMAN LIKE THAT,
RIGHT?

39:30.599 --> 39:32.641
YEAH. SHE'S JUST A FLING.
 MM.

39:32.641 --> 39:33.872
A PALATE CLEANSER.
 (chuckles)

39:33.872 --> 39:35.844
THE SORBET YOU EAT
BETWEEN COURSES.

39:35.844 --> 39:38.747
I'M REALLY SORRY
I SAID THAT.

39:38.747 --> 39:40.949
I GIVE THE WHOLE THING
THREE WEEKS.

39:40.949 --> 39:42.751
(Tom) LYNETTE?

39:44.653 --> 39:49.758
HEY! TOM.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:49.758 --> 39:51.820
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CAR.
 OKAY.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.764
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:57.626 --> 39:58.897
I KNOW.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.929
KNOW WHAT?

40:00.929 --> 40:03.672
WH--

40:03.672 --> 40:05.904
OKAY. (sighs)

40:05.904 --> 40:08.006
WE JUST HAD DINNER
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.978
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.911
WHATEVER.

40:14.843 --> 40:17.946
SO THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
SPENDING YOUR FREE TIME NOW,

40:17.946 --> 40:19.718
SPYING ON ME?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.690
WELL, THAT'S
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY, TOM.

40:21.690 --> 40:22.751
ACT LIKE I'M THE ONE
IN THE WRONG.

40:22.751 --> 40:24.853
YOU'RE THE ONE DATING
THE UNDERWEAR MODEL.

40:24.853 --> 40:27.796
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:29.698 --> 40:31.860
CHLOE? I'M NOT DATING CHLOE.

40:31.860 --> 40:34.733
JEEZ, LYNETTE,
GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.905
THEN YOU HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
DINNER WITH? WHY ARE YOU HERE?

40:36.905 --> 40:39.868
I AM PICKING UP JANE,
CHLOE'S MOM.

40:46.915 --> 40:49.948
LIKE I SAID, IT'S JUST
A COUPLE OF DINNERS AND COFFEE.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.980
OH, IT'S COFFEE NOW?

40:51.980 --> 40:54.953
GOD, TOM, WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME THIS?

40:54.953 --> 40:57.826
THURSDAY, IN COUNSELING.

41:00.689 --> 41:01.860
YOU READY TO GO?

41:01.860 --> 41:02.931
YEAH.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.835
LYNETTE, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
THURSDAY, RIGHT?

41:06.835 --> 41:08.797
WHAT'S THE POINT?

41:12.000 --> 41:16.845
YES, WE OFTEN LEARN
OUR MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS

41:16.845 --> 41:21.850
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM--

41:21.850 --> 41:26.955
THE PAINFUL TRUTH ABOUT
THE STATE OF A RELATIONSHIP...

41:26.955 --> 41:32.791
THE UGLY COST
OF CHALLENGING AUTHORITY...

41:32.791 --> 41:39.868
THE SAD FACT THAT LIFE'S COLORS
AREN'T ALWAYS ROSY...

41:39.868 --> 41:42.070
THEN THERE ARE THOSE

41:42.070 --> 41:46.975
WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT
THESE IMPORTANT LESSONS.

41:46.975 --> 41:49.908
THEY SIMPLY WAIT FOR THE CHANCE

41:49.908 --> 41:52.941
TO TEACH A LESSON OF THEIR OWN.

41:56.084 --> 41:58.847
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STILL
STEWING ABOUT THAT REDHEAD.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.921
WELL, I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF GETTING LED ON

42:02.921 --> 42:05.954
AND HUMILIATED,
SO, YEAH, I'M NOT...

42:05.954 --> 42:08.026
DON'T THINK I'M LETTING GO
OF THIS ONE YET.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.898
SUIT YOURSELF.

42:09.898 --> 42:12.030
I GOT SOME MISSING PERSON
REPORTS HERE FOR YOU.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.963
JUST TOSS 'EM OVER THERE.
