WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:06.140
(Mindy)
THERE'S NO BETTER FEELING THAN
HAVING FOUND THE PERFECT MAN,

00:06.174 --> 00:08.609
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHEN YOU START
TO WONDER,

00:08.642 --> 00:12.246
"WHEN'S THIS IDIOT
GONNA LOCK ME DOWN?"

00:12.280 --> 00:13.247
OKAY, WEIRDO.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.685
AND THE HUNT FOR A SIGN THAT
HE'S BUYING AN ENGAGEMENT RING

00:17.718 --> 00:19.287
IS ON.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.189
[clears throat]
EXCUSE ME, MISS.
YES?

00:21.222 --> 00:24.658
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN
PURCHASE AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.494
MM-MM.
DAMN IT.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.662
[shredder whirring]

00:28.696 --> 00:32.266
IF IT'S POSSIBLE, TRY TO CHECK
HIS CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.102
DAMN IT.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.771
IN THE END, YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE
TO GET A LITTLE CREATIVE.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.742
"FOREVER STONES"?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.144
[gasps]

00:43.177 --> 00:44.145
I'M GETTING ENGAGED.

00:44.178 --> 00:47.148
[hip-hop music]

00:47.181 --> 00:55.189
*

00:58.259 --> 01:01.095
(Mindy)
THAT'S IT. YOU GOT IT.
THAT'S IT.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.563
THE BABY'S ALMOST TURNED.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.333
JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
PRESSURE IS FIRM AND CONSISTENT,

01:05.366 --> 01:06.534
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO CONVINCE YOUR BOYFRIEND

01:06.567 --> 01:08.202
TO DO A COUPLES COSTUME.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.203
FOCUS, FOCUS.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.204
(Jean)
DR. LAHIRI?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.539
YEAH?
IN MY OFFICE.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.541
NOW.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.109
(all)
OOH.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.277
OKAY. OKAY.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.511
AM I IN TROUBLE?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.780
IS IT BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE LOST
A PRESS-ON NAIL IN THAT WOMAN?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.182
NO, LAHIRI.
BECAUSE I--

01:21.215 --> 01:22.283
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.818
OVER THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,
YOU'VE PROVEN YOURSELF

01:24.852 --> 01:26.654
TO BE A VERY GIFTED TEACHER.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.589
I LOVE THOSE
LITTLE SONS OF BITCHES.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.858
WHICH IS WHY
I'VE RECOMMENDED YOU

01:30.891 --> 01:34.128
FOR THE MACMILLAN/DOW TEACHING
FELLOWSHIP AT STANFORD.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.229
ME?
YOU.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.497
STANFORD?
YES.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.266
JEAN, THAT'S
FOR THE SMART KIDS.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.301
YOU WILL GO THERE,
YOU WILL LEARN THE LATEST

01:40.334 --> 01:42.603
IN FERTILITY TECHNIQUES
FOR EIGHT MONTHS,

01:42.636 --> 01:44.905
YOU WILL RETURN,
AND TEACH THEM HERE.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.774
WOW, JEAN.
YOU'RE BELIEVING IN ME?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.209
I HOPE IT DOESN'T GO
TO MY HEAD.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.310
SO THAT'S A "YES."

01:49.343 --> 01:50.344
I WANT TO SAY YES.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.712
I REALLY DO.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.348
JUST--I THINK MY BOYFRIEND
IS ABOUT TO PROPOSE TO ME,

01:54.382 --> 01:56.350
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA SPOOK HIM

01:56.384 --> 01:58.786
BEFORE I CAN SINK MY FANGS
INTO HIS LITTLE NECK.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.221
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.722
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.890
LAHIRI...
YEAH?

02:02.923 --> 02:06.727
STANFORD IS
AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.595
I KNOW.
[chuckles]

02:07.628 --> 02:09.797
CAN YOU IMAGINE--
BEING TAN IN FEBRUARY?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.399
JUST KIDDING. BUT I MEAN,
SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.201
OUT, LAHIRI.
YEAH.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.673
(Peter)
HEY.
[knock at door]

02:19.707 --> 02:22.676
SLUMLORD THOUSANDAIRE, I GOT
YOUR RENT CHECK RIGHT HERE.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.213
I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE,
"FOR SEX" ON THE MEMO LINE.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.113
WOW.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.315
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AN EASY MAN
TO IMPRESS,

02:27.348 --> 02:28.816
UNLESS I'M WATCHING
A MAGIC SHOW,

02:28.849 --> 02:31.785
BUT HONESTLY, I'M IMPRESSED.
PETE, YOU'RE REALLY MATURING.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.755
YEAH? ARE YOU IMPRESSED ENOUGH
TO MAYBE SET ME UP ON A DATE?

02:34.788 --> 02:37.291
YOU KNOW WHAT? I MIGHT HAVE
A GIRL FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.360
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AN "A."

02:39.393 --> 02:41.329
IT COULD BE A "B" WITH "D"s,
A "D" WITH "B"s.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.863
OKAY, SHUT UP BEFORE
I CHANGE MY MIND.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.532
OKAY?
IT'S MY FRIEND JESSICA.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.933
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.336
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
SHE'S A DOCTOR.
UH-HUH.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.338
THERE IS ONE SMALL THING.
SMALL.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.839
IS IT A PENIS?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.341
BECAUSE IF IT IS,
BASED ON THE SIZE,

02:53.374 --> 02:54.875
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO WORK AROUND IT.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.311
YOU CAN?
YOU COULDN'T?

02:57.345 --> 02:59.447
LOOK, JESSICA HAS
A THIS CONDITION--

02:59.480 --> 03:02.350
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MINDY
WATCHES IN THE REALITY SHOWS.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.286
IS SHE, LIKE, A REAL HOUSEWIFE
OR A TODDLER WITH A TIARA

03:05.319 --> 03:06.487
OR A RIVER MONSTER?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.990
'CAUSE NONE OF THOSE THINGS SEEM
LIKE DEAL BREAKERS TO ME.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.659
[whispering]
SHE'S A, UH...

03:11.692 --> 03:13.827
SHE'S A HOARDER.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.628
OH.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.529
[normal voice]
OKAY? BUT RECOVERING.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.799
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH
WORKS IN PROGRESS, SO...

03:18.832 --> 03:21.502
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
CAN I HAVE HER NUMBER?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.571
I'D GIVE IT TO YOU,
BUT SHE'S GOT, LIKE, TEN PHONES.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.639
IT'S A WHOLE THING.
SHE'LL FIND YOU.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.641
SHE'LL FIND ME?
YEAH.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.743
I LIKE THAT.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.413
EVERYONE, I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
THAT SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES

03:32.446 --> 03:35.283
IS ONCE AGAIN HOSTING
ITS ANNUAL HOLIDAY PARTY.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.917
OH, MY GOD. JUST CALL
IT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.918
CHRISTMAS PARTY!

03:37.951 --> 03:38.986
YEAH!

03:39.019 --> 03:40.354
HOWEVER, UNLIKE PAST YEARS,

03:40.388 --> 03:42.022
THIS YEAR'S PARTY SHALL BE
AN ELEGANT AFFAIR.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.023
OOH.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.224
OOH!

03:44.258 --> 03:47.261
"ELEGANT"? DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN'T WEAR MY MISTLETOE BELT?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.396
YEAH, WHAT GIVES JEREMY?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.397
CHRISTMAS ISN'T ABOUT ELEGANCE.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
IT'S ABOUT A QUIET NIGHT
WHEN THE KING WAS BORN--

03:51.865 --> 03:53.033
THE PRINCE OF PEACE.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.268
SHUT UP, LINUS.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.437
I WANT A PARTY WHERE I CAN CHOKE
DOWN MY CHAMPAGNE AND CAVIAR.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.871
YEAH!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.907
THE TRUTH IS,
LAUREN HAS IT IN HER HEAD

03:59.940 --> 04:01.008
THAT I'VE RECENTLY GROWN
DISTANT.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.712
SO I'VE INVITED HER NEUROSURGERY
COLLEAGUES TO JOIN US.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.347
WHAT?
UGH!

04:06.380 --> 04:07.381
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I KNOW.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.016
NEUROSURGERY?
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.217
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.320
IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE
A HOLIDAY PARTY NOW.
AMEN, SISTER.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.321
EXCUSE ME?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.988
A RATHER SEMITIC GROUP.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
THAT'S NOT ANTI-SEMITIC
TO SAY THEY'RE SEMITIC.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.759
WE WELCOME JEWS.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.428
SECOND OF ALL,
THOSE STUPID NEUROSURGEONS

04:20.461 --> 04:21.495
THINK THEY'RE BETTER
THAN ALL OF US.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.363
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.298
HOW? THE BRAIN HAS
NO NERVE ENDINGS!

04:24.332 --> 04:25.866
YOU POKE A BRAIN,
WHO CARES?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.001
YOU POKE A VAGINA,
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.303
RIGHT?
AMEN, SISTER.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.671
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BUMP THIS. I'M OUT.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.939
[all gasp]

04:31.972 --> 04:33.073
FINE, MORE GOOSE FOR US.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.875
OKAY, EVERYONE, CALM DOWN.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.978
DR. C'S UNDER A LOT OF STRESS
BECAUSE HE'S MY SECRET SANTA

04:38.011 --> 04:39.413
AND HE HAS THIS PRESSURE TO GIVE
ME A GREAT GIFT,

04:39.447 --> 04:40.414
WHICH HE SHOULD.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.950
OH, MORGAN, DR. C TOLD ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.752
[gasps]
(Beverly)
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.053
BATTERIES?

04:46.086 --> 04:47.688
OH, FOR MY BATTERY COLLECTION.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.022
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS NOW?

04:49.056 --> 04:49.957
I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY
THAT DANNY'S GONE,

04:49.990 --> 04:51.325
BECAUSE
I'M HIS SECRET SANTA,

04:51.359 --> 04:52.426
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO GET HIM.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.761
GOLF BALLS.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.062
NO, THAT'S FOR WHITE PEOPLE.
DANNY IS ITALIAN.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.064
MEATBALLS.
I'LL JUST EAT THEM.

05:01.402 --> 05:05.673
SO YOU WERE ABLE TO CHANGE
THE SETTING, RIGHT?

05:05.706 --> 05:07.708
BUT THE STONE IS STILL
THE FIRST ONE?

05:07.741 --> 05:11.078
PERFECT, THAT'S PERFECT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.113
YEAH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SHOW MY GIRLFRIEND TONIGHT.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.049
[gasps]
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.354
MINDY!

05:20.388 --> 05:22.423
MINDY!
HEY, JESSICA.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.256
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.658
I HEARD YOU CLEARED OUT
YOUR ENTRYWAY,

05:24.692 --> 05:27.428
AND YOU FOUND $5,000
IN UNCASHED PAYCHECKS.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.430
VERY COOL.
YEAH, IT WAS HELL.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.731
BUT MY THERAPIST SAYS,

05:30.764 --> 05:32.733
"YOU DO NOT NEED
12 BROKEN PRINTERS,

05:32.766 --> 05:34.368
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE THEM
TO YOUR KIDS SOMEDAY."

05:34.402 --> 05:35.769
CAN I HAVE THE PRINTERS?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.371
NO.
I MEAN--WHAT AM I SAYING?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.972
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PRINT ANYTHING.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.042
HEY, DANNY IS SETTING ME UP
ON A DATE WITH HIS FRIEND PETER?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.512
BUT WHEN I ASK IF HE'S CUTE,
DANNY JUST TURNS RED

05:44.545 --> 05:46.113
AND SAYS HE CAN'T TELL
WITH GUYS.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.081
OKAY, I'M GONNA PICTURE HIM
WITHOUT HIS PERSONALITY.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.983
WHOA.
PETER MIGHT BE HOT.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.886
OKAY, I CAN'T TELL.
I'M TOO CLOSE TO IT.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.423
BUT HE IS EATING POPCORN
ON THE SOFA IN THE LOUNGE.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.690
OH. THANKS.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.792
UH-UH-UH,
CAN I HAVE SOME?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.429
IT'S MOSTLY
JUST KERNELS LEFT.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.630
OH, GOD, NO ONE LIKES
THE KERNELS.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.131
I'LL THROW IT OUT
FOR YOU.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.500
I'LL SEE YOU, DOC.
LATER, MAN.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.601
BE GOOD.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.604
[crunches loudly]
AAH! OH, MY--

06:10.638 --> 06:12.072
OH!

06:14.007 --> 06:16.076
IT'S JUST KERNELS.
YOU DON'T WANT ANY.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.512
I'M JESSICA.
I--

06:18.546 --> 06:19.713
SORRY THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD,

06:19.747 --> 06:21.649
BUT I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO ON A DATE.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.417
WHOA.
[chuckles]

06:23.451 --> 06:26.520
[chuckles]
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

06:26.554 --> 06:30.057
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL ANGEL,
AND I'M WRECK-IT RALPH.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.625
NO, NO, NO,
I'M DANNY'S FRIEND.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.427
HE'S SETTING US UP.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.462
DID HE NOT TELL YOU?

06:34.495 --> 06:37.431
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALK--

06:37.465 --> 06:39.867
OH, MY GOD.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.535
YOU'RE HIS
SECRET-SANTA GIFT?

06:41.569 --> 06:43.003
[laughs]
UH...

06:43.036 --> 06:45.072
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT STUPID DANCE

06:45.105 --> 06:46.740
HE GAVE DOCTOR L LAST YEAR.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.576
AND THE BATTERIES?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.511
HE KEPT IT UNDER TEN BUCKS.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.212
I ACCEPT.
[chuckles]

06:52.245 --> 06:54.114
(Danny)
MINDY, I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

06:54.147 --> 06:57.851
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED
THIS SPECIAL DINNER TONIGHT.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.821
MINDY LAHIRI,
I FINALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.530
I BOUGHT A BURIAL PLOT.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.598
WHAT?

07:10.631 --> 07:11.765
FOREVER STONES.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.766
EXCUSE ME?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.167
YEAH, IT'S CARRARA MARBLE.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.168
THEY CHANGED THE SETTINGS

07:15.202 --> 07:17.104
SO IT'S LOOKING OVER
FRESH KILLS.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.172
CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I'M PSYCHED.

07:19.206 --> 07:22.142
OH, WELL...

07:22.175 --> 07:24.077
TWIN BURIAL PLOTS
IS KIND OF ROMANTIC.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.781
OH, NO, IT'S--
IT'S JUST FOR ME.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.118
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW YOUR RELIGION
HANDLES THIS KIND OF STUFF.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.153
DON'T THEY LET THE RIVER
JUST TAKE CARE OF IT?

07:33.186 --> 07:35.455
CAN I HAVE
THE DESSERT MENU, PLEASE?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.959
JEAN?
JEAN.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.060
I ACCEPT THE FELLOWSHIP.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.129
IT'S A FELLOWSHIP.
YOU NEED TO APPLY.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.532
JEAN, I'M APPLYING
FOR THE FELLOWSHIP.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.033
GOOD.
IT'S DUE TOMORROW BY 5:00.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.134
DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO IT OR NOT, JEAN?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.602
COME ON.
OF COURSE.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.938
BUT IT REQUIRES
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS

07:50.971 --> 07:52.239
AND A PERSONAL ESSAY.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.508
WHAT DOES DANNY THINK
ABOUT THIS?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.009
I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.845
HE HAS A WAY OF TALKING ME
OUT OF THINGS.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.980
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, I'D BE
COVERED IN SIMPSONS TATTOOS.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.582
BE STRONG, LAHIRI.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.617
A WOMAN'S CAREER AND AMBITIONS

08:03.651 --> 08:05.252
DON'T AGE WELL ON A SHELF.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.555
PUT THEM AWAY
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.957
BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.158
YOU'RE SO WISE.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.860
WHY ARE YOU WASTING TIME
IN MEDICINE?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.629
YOU SHOULD BE A LIFE COACH
ON THE BIGGEST LOSER.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.965
(Danny)
YOU'RE HOME.
HELP ME OUT WITH THIS TREE.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.300
HEY, WHERE'S MY RIHANNA
CHRISTMAS-TREE TOPPER?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.170
A CHRISTMAS TREE IS NO PLACE
FOR EXPOSED BREASTS.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.972
YOU'RE LUCKY I LET YOU PUT UP
THAT WREATH.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
WREATH WITHERSPOON?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.142
THIS IS THE NICEST THING
IN YOUR APARTMENT.
MM-HMM.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.011
HEY, DO YOU HAVE DR. LEDREAU'S
PHONE NUMBER?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.546

ANYONE DATING MY MA--

08:32.580 --> 08:33.981
I'M GONNA DO A FULL BACKGROUND
CHECK ON THAT GUY.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.116
I KNOW WHAT HE EATS
FOR BREAKFAST--

08:36.149 --> 08:38.151
EGGS.
WHY? WHY DO YOU WANT IT?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.821
I AM APPLYING FOR A FELLOWSHIP
AT STANFORD.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.155
I WANT HIM TO WRITE
MY RECOMMENDATION.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.657
I DON'T WANT TO EMAIL WITH HIM,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

08:43.691 --> 08:45.125
EMAILING WITH OLD PEOPLE'S
SUCH A NIGHTMARE.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.328
WAIT. WHAT DID YOU SAY--
"STANFORD"?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.230
THAT'S IN CALIFORNIA.

MATERIALISTIC PART

WHAT ABOUT US?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.870
WELL, DANNY,
YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON

08:56.904 --> 08:58.672
I CONSIDERED NOT APPLYING, BUT,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.873
WE'RE NOT ENGAGED.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.041
THIS IS THE ONLY TIME
I COULD GO.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.710
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.878
I WOULD INVITE YOU,
BUT THE BOYS IN THE CASTRO--

09:04.912 --> 09:07.948
THEY WOULD EAT YOU ALIVE.
YEAH, THEY WOULD.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.316
IT'S ONLY EIGHT MONTHS.

09:09.349 --> 09:13.854
I'LL BE BACK IN TIME
TO RUIN FOOTBALL SEASON FOR YOU.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.889
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.026

09:19.059 --> 09:20.994
(Peter)
SHE'S DOING WHAT?

09:21.028 --> 09:21.995
WHY WOULD MINDY GO
TO STANFORD?

09:22.029 --> 09:24.164
SHE HATES NOT BEING
THE ONLY ASIAN IN THE ROOM.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.166
YEAH, BUT IT'S
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

09:26.199 --> 09:27.334
FOR HER, OKAY?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.036
AND LIKE SHE SAID,
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.971
SHE SAID THAT TO YOU?
YEAH.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.706
MINDY DOESN'T WANT TO GO
TO STANFORD.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.008
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED THIS.
WHAT?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.844
BUDDY, YOU'RE
IN A PROPOSAL TRAP.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.279
STOP! LOOK, MINDY'S NOT
GONNA MOVE FROM A BLUE STATE

09:39.312 --> 09:42.015
TO AN EVEN BLUER STATE
JUST TO GET ME TO PROPOSE.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.817
WE ALL READ HER DIARY.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.254
WE KNOW SHE WANTS
TO BE ENGAGED BY CHRISTMAS.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.124
OH, MAN.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.093
I'LL HAVE TO PAWN
MY GRANDMOTHER'S WHEELCHAIR

09:53.126 --> 09:54.361
TO PAY FOR IT,
BUT WHAT A DATE.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.362
THIS IS YOU.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.997
THIS IS YOUR
APARTMENT BUILDING.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.700
I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU TONIGHT.
YEAH.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.334
I KIND OF WANT
TO INVITE YOU UPSTAIRS,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.236
BUT I'M REALLY EMBARRASSED
ABOUT MY APARTMENT.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.405
I LIVE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER
AND 40 DOGS.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.940
COME ON UP.
YEAH!

10:06.974 --> 10:09.242
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.912
(Morgan)
I DON'T GET HOW HOARDER
IS A BAD THING.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.413
WHY WOULD YOU BE EMBARRASSED
BY THIS PLACE?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.415
IT'S LIKE LIVING
INSIDE OF A CATALOG.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.117
AND YOU HAVE A MOUNTAIN
OF CATALOGS!

10:17.150 --> 10:20.020
I CAN'T BELIEVE AFTER ALL
THE STORIES I'VE HEARD,

10:20.053 --> 10:22.856
I SLEPT
WITH PETER PRENTICE.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.257

10:24.291 --> 10:26.159
(Ledreau)
AH, DANNY.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.329
SAY, I'M WORKING ON THIS
RECOMMENDATION FOR DR. LAHIRI,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.899
AND I'M WONDERING
IF YOU KNOW ANY ADJECTIVES

10:31.932 --> 10:33.033
OTHER THAN "INDIAN."

10:33.066 --> 10:34.101
I'M STUMPED.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.036
YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T WASTE
YOUR ENERGY, DR. LEDREAU.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.105
I DON'T THINK SHE'S SERIOUS
ABOUT STANFORD.

10:38.138 --> 10:38.972
I'D PREFER TO PLEASE HER,

10:39.006 --> 10:40.908
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S
A POSSIBILITY

10:40.941 --> 10:43.010
OF HER FOLLOWING THROUGH
ON ANY OF THOSE THREATS.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.011
LOOK, MINDY GETS EXCITED,

10:44.044 --> 10:46.780
AND SHE JUMPS INTO THINGS
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.282
SHE RAN FOR CITY COUNCIL
JUST TO GET MORE TRANS FATS

10:49.316 --> 10:50.684
IN HER FOOD, SO...

10:50.718 --> 10:53.086
I SEE.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.023
DAN, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.
THANK YOU, SIR.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.992
WORRIED ABOUT MINDY'S
WELL-BEING.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.062
IN MY DAY, WE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT WOMEN'S FEELINGS.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.031
ARE WE BETTER NOW?

11:04.064 --> 11:06.700
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.036
REGARDLESS,
NO RECOMMENDATION?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.304
I WOULD SAY DON'T WRITE IT.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.106
IT'S FINE.
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

11:17.945 --> 11:21.281
DR. REED, ARE PEOPLE ALLOWED
TO GIVE TOASTS TONIGHT?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.117
I HAVE SOME HEARTFELT
HOLIDAY THOUGHTS.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.486
YOU KNOW WHAT, BEVERLY?
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.490
I GOT SOME THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT ISRAEL.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.960

UPON YOURSELF.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.828
LET THAT BE FAIR WARNING
TO YOU ALL.

THINKS I AM SOMEONE ELSE,

11:43.370 --> 11:45.205

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.177
YOUR NAME IS MORGAN?

15:44.211 --> 15:46.513
HE'S ALSO AN EX-CON
WHO LIVES WITH HIS GRANDMA.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.515
DAMN IT!
HOW DID YOU GET OUT?

15:48.548 --> 15:49.516
I WIGGLED.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.519
JESS, JESS, I WANT TO--

15:52.552 --> 15:55.588
WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT DANNY?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.157
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.192
(both)
WHAT?

15:59.226 --> 16:00.327
MEANT EVERY WORD, PAL.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.295
I HAVE TO GO FIND JESSICA.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.563
EXCUSE ME.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.632
DANNY AND I--
WE USED TO HATE EACH OTHER.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.067
OVER TIME, THAT CHANGED,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.602
BUT IT WASN'T
UNTIL I WENT TO HAITI

16:09.636 --> 16:12.005
AND I GOT THIS LETTER
THAT I REALIZED HOW MUCH.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.273
[clears throat]

16:13.306 --> 16:16.543
"MINDY, I'M STILL SURPRISED THAT
YOU LIKE GETTING THESE LETTERS.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.545
"BUT I'M GLAD,
BECAUSE I LIKE WRITING THEM.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.447
"I WOULDN'T SAY I MISS YOU,

"BUT IT HASN'T BEEN THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU HERE.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.652
"FINE. I MISS YOU, BUT
DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.221
YOUR FRIEND, DAN."

16:28.255 --> 16:30.290
GUESS WHAT.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.025
IT WENT TO MY HEAD.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.396
OVER THE YEARS,
DANNY HAS SENT ME MANY LETTERS

16:36.429 --> 16:39.599
APPRECIATING MY WORK--
ALL VERY KIND...

16:39.632 --> 16:41.301
SOME TOO KIND...

16:41.334 --> 16:43.703
IN A WAY THAT CHILLED ME
TO THE BONE.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.573
HE WANTED ME TO MAKE A FILM
ABOUT STATEN ISLAND.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.209
IT WAS ADORABLE COMING
FROM A LITTLE KID.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.510
BUT THE LETTERS DIDN'T STOP.

16:50.543 --> 16:54.147
BY 1998, I WAS LIKE,
"GET A LIFE, NERD."

16:54.181 --> 16:56.083
BUT STILL,
THE LETTERS CAME.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.051
HE HATED IT.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.353
UH, I-I LIKED IT.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.255
I THOUGHT WE HAD GOOD
ON-SCREEN CHEMISTRY,

17:02.289 --> 17:04.524
WHICH MAKES ME THINK
THAT WE WOULD BANG GOOD.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.159
GOD.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.198
[women breathing heavily]

17:11.831 --> 17:13.200
MA.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.334
WHAT?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
MA, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING

17:19.372 --> 17:20.407
WHEN I TANKED HER FELLOWSHIP.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.375
PROPOSING IS THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.243
HOW?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.378
NO, NO, DANNY,
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.347
YOU GOT TO GET MINDY
WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.316
I DON'T KNOW, MA.
A BOOB JOB?

17:29.349 --> 17:32.119
SHE'LL GO TOO BIG, AND I'LL
NEVER GET THE SHAPE I WANT.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.322
NO, YOU GAGOOT, YOU GOT TO TRY
TO GET HER INTO THAT FELLOWSHIP.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.858
MA, OF COURSE.
GET HER INTO THE FELLOWSHIP.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.693
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.795
MA, IF I COULD MARRY YOU,
I WOULD.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.264
YOU STOP BEING WEIRD.
GO.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.598
OKAY.
GO. GO.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.300
JESSICA!

17:47.334 --> 17:49.302
I'M SORRY!

17:49.336 --> 17:51.238
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DECEIVE YOU...

17:51.271 --> 17:53.540
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
ABOUT ME NOT UNDERSTANDING

17:53.573 --> 17:54.607
WHAT DOGS ARE SAYING.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.510
I DO.
THAT IS TRUE.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.511
JESSICA!

17:58.545 --> 17:59.646
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:59.679 --> 18:03.616
UH...

18:03.650 --> 18:05.685
JUST CHILLIN'.

18:05.718 --> 18:09.389
[sighs]
NO, I CAME HERE TO SEE YOU.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.791
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS PETER

18:11.824 --> 18:13.360
UNTIL THE DATE WAS OVER.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.162
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M A MESS.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.230
I JUST BOUGHT A 50-POUND BAG
OF KITTY LITTER.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.398
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAT.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.400
I LITERALLY DON'T HAVE ROOM
IN MY LIFE

18:20.433 --> 18:21.801
FOR A BOYFRIEND
I CAN'T TRUST.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.538
OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND...

18:25.572 --> 18:27.174
YET...

18:27.207 --> 18:28.208
'CAUSE I DON'T DESERVE IT.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.343

TO START OVER,

18:30.377 --> 18:31.411
FROM THE BEGINNING--

18:31.444 --> 18:35.448
JUST TWO STRANGERS,
DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER--

18:35.482 --> 18:38.618
AND JUST SEE
WHERE THAT GOES.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.920
TOTAL HONESTY?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.256
TOTAL HONESTY.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.461
TOTAL HONESTY?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.263
I FARTED.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.598
WHY DON'T WE GO
WITH PARTIAL HONESTY?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.765
OKAY.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.804
HEY, LAUREN.
HEY.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.772
BEFORE YOU GO,
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.410
I KNOW HENRY'S
A BIG FAN OF TRUCKS,

19:03.443 --> 19:04.677
SO I GOT HIM A TRUCK.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.379
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.514
YEAH, YEAH.
NO PROBLEM.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.715
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.750
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S HAPPY HANUKKAH.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.651
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

I FORGOT THAT YOU
WERE A FELLOW SOLDIER..

19:13.586 --> 19:14.354
(both)
IN THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.389
YEAH, YOU HATE CHRISTMAS,
I FORGOT.

[elevator bell beeps]

19:17.790 --> 19:19.459

WHEN PEOPLE START TO COME,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.569
WE'RE GOING TO BE
VERY, VERY STILL.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.471
DR. CASTELLANO?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.805
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.374
WHAT'S THIS?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.875
ARE ALL THE MEN FROM YOUR CHURCH
STILL AT THE OFFICE?

19:35.908 --> 19:36.709
NO.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.412
THIS IS AN ALL-FEMALE,
LIVING NATIVITY.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.980
EVERYBODY?
YEAH.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.385

19:45.418 --> 19:47.554
NO MEN ALLOWED.
YOU'RE RUINING IT.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.888
AREN'T YOU CUTE?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.290
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.225
SORRY. LOOK, I GOT
MINDY'S APPLICATION--

19:52.259 --> 19:55.228
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS,
AND I WROTE THE LAST ONE.

19:55.262 --> 19:59.799
WELL, THAT IS VERY UNSELFISH
OF YOU, DR. CASTELLANO.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.934
ARE THOSE
THE THREE WISE WOMEN?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.303
YES.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.637
OKAY, I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.473
THIS IS BASICALLY WITCHCRAFT.

MMM, MMM.

YOU WILL BE PAID
NOTHING, MORGAN.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.585
DON'T STOP IT, I LOVED IT.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.421
YEAH? YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH
THAT YOU LEFT THE PARTY EARLY?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.489
[sighs]

20:22.522 --> 20:26.326
I LEFT THE PARTY EARLY...
