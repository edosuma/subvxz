03:16.931 --> 03:18.197

03:19.533 --> 03:24.436

03:26.340 --> 03:30.209
Was tagged as a different guy.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.077
So then I tried to interrogate

03:32.079 --> 03:33.512
Him and question him for a

03:33.514 --> 03:35.781
While, and he just kind of kept

Throwing a lot of b.S. To me,

03:37.985 --> 03:42.054
And we didn't talk for a while.

Part of my life.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.928
I, like, live at the mall, and

07:09.930 --> 07:11.763
Fashion capitals is either l.A.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.131
Or new york.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.499
I chose l.A.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.434
I wanted to go to the art

07:15.436 --> 07:16.435
Institute.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.302
>> so you must have been really

07:17.304 --> 07:18.703
Excited cameryn was in

07:18.705 --> 07:19.871
Santa monica.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.639
>> honestly, that's one of the

07:20.641 --> 07:21.940
Reasons why I moved out to

07:21.942 --> 07:22.974
California.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.843
But I didn't tell a lot of

07:24.845 --> 07:26.344
People, just because coming from

07:26.346 --> 07:27.779
A small town and the people I

07:27.781 --> 07:29.514
Know, even my closest friends,

07:29.516 --> 07:31.483
There would be judgment.

07:31.485 --> 07:38.723
And then that's when the excuses

07:38.725 --> 07:40.258
And everything arose.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.161
There was, you know, problems,

07:43.163 --> 07:46.264
And his phone was off.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.466
I told him I was hurt.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.101
He was apologetic, I guess, but

07:50.103 --> 07:51.470
I didn't really try much after

07:51.472 --> 07:53.638
That, I was so disappointed.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.606
I noticed that some of the

07:54.608 --> 07:57.943
Pictures on his fake profile had

07:57.945 --> 08:00.045
A club name on it.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.848
I googled it, and it was a club

08:02.850 --> 08:04.449
In atlanta, and I found out

08:04.451 --> 08:06.051
They had a facebook page.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.352
They had photos, and I

08:07.354 --> 08:08.453
Eventually found one with him

08:08.455 --> 08:09.955
In it, but he was tagged as

08:09.957 --> 08:10.856
Another person.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.923
>> hmm.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.924
>> his name was josh.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.160
I clicked on josh's name, and it

08:15.162 --> 08:17.095
Was a legitimate profile.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.396
I actually messaged josh on

08:18.398 --> 08:19.431
Facebook, and I explained it to

08:19.433 --> 08:21.633
Him, and he obviously blew his

08:21.635 --> 08:22.300
Top.

08:22.302 --> 08:22.968
He was like, "someone's

08:22.970 --> 08:24.269
Pretending to be me?"

08:24.271 --> 08:25.370
At that point, I brought it up

08:25.372 --> 08:27.873
To cam, and he just kept lying

08:27.875 --> 08:28.773
And kept coming up with all

08:28.775 --> 08:29.875
These other stories and

08:29.877 --> 08:31.443
Everything, and I just kind of

08:31.445 --> 08:34.246
Was like, "screw you."

08:34.248 --> 08:35.746
Then, I was going through some

08:35.749 --> 08:37.249
Things again, and I had to move

08:37.251 --> 08:38.416
Home.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.051
A lot of my friends in owatonna

08:40.053 --> 08:41.919
Weren't my friends anymore, and

08:41.922 --> 08:44.556
They just kind of wrote me off,

08:44.558 --> 08:46.258
And I didn't really have anyone

08:46.260 --> 08:49.528
To talk to, and he was one of

08:49.530 --> 08:51.963
The only ones that kind of knew

08:51.965 --> 08:53.365
Everything, and I was like--I

08:53.367 --> 08:54.699
Had to talk to somebody.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.901
>> he also had, like, a new

08:55.903 --> 08:57.536
Story for you when you sort of

08:57.538 --> 08:58.370
Reconnected, right?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.738
>> he said his name was james,

08:59.740 --> 09:00.705
And he actually lives in

09:00.707 --> 09:01.640
Atlanta.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.975
I asked him about his fake

09:03.977 --> 09:06.311
Profile, and he said that he

09:06.313 --> 09:07.546
Wanted to escape, like, his

09:07.548 --> 09:08.480
Reality, I guess.

09:08.482 --> 09:11.116
He's had troubles at home.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.152
But he was there for me, and it

09:14.154 --> 09:15.921
Became, like, a daily thing,

09:15.923 --> 09:17.289
Like, calling him on my breaks

09:17.291 --> 09:19.257
At work, and all of a sudden,

09:19.259 --> 09:21.560
All over again, I'm back in

09:21.562 --> 09:22.761
Love with this other guy, and I

09:22.763 --> 09:25.430
Don't know who it is really.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.598
>> I'd love to see kind of

09:26.600 --> 09:28.099
Everything you have.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.937
>> yeah.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.371
There's, like, 10,000...

09:33.373 --> 09:34.039
>> oh, my god!

09:34.041 --> 09:34.806
>> so it's gonna take a long

09:34.808 --> 09:36.007
Time to get to the top.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.578
>> that is a lot of talking.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.983
>> ♪ I wait for you

09:44.985 --> 09:48.186
♪ to say the words

09:48.188 --> 09:50.922
♪ I want to be true

09:50.924 --> 09:52.023
>> "I gave you every ounce of my

09:52.025 --> 09:53.258
Heart, energy, and time,

09:53.260 --> 09:54.793
Assuming I could get your love

09:54.795 --> 09:57.495
Back and a future with you, not

09:57.497 --> 09:58.964
To get stomped on and walked

09:58.966 --> 10:00.665
Over and taken advantage of."

10:00.667 --> 10:01.666
>> this is right when I found

10:01.668 --> 10:04.803
Out everything was fake.

10:04.805 --> 10:10.475
>> ♪ would I wait all my days

10:10.477 --> 10:11.176
>> were you thinking about

10:11.178 --> 10:13.445
Marrying this guy?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.913
>> yeah.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.681
But obviously, you have to meet

10:16.683 --> 10:17.882
Somebody to marry somebody.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.017
[laughs]

10:19.019 --> 10:22.621
But lots of "I love yous."

10:22.623 --> 10:23.588
>> I just sort of want to make

10:23.590 --> 10:25.624
Sure you're sure that you are

10:25.626 --> 10:28.259
Ready to really find out the

10:28.261 --> 10:29.094
Truth.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.997
>> three years is long enough,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.732
And I'm tired of a "what if?"

10:33.734 --> 10:34.766
I have to know.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.700
I need to know.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.768
I'm ready.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.736
>> all right, well, we're here.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.670
We're gonna do it.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.572
>> oh, thank you guys so much.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.907
Honestly, it means the world to

10:42.909 --> 10:43.675
Me.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.276
Thank you.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.044
>> we'll get to the bottom of

10:46.046 --> 10:46.711
It, yeah.

10:46.713 --> 10:47.379
>> ready?

10:47.381 --> 10:48.046
Let's do this.

10:48.048 --> 10:48.713
>> bye.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.748
>> both: Bye-bye.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.517
>> if this guy is just some

10:52.519 --> 10:54.519
Loser who's manipulating this

10:54.521 --> 10:56.521
Poor girl who has a sick mom...

10:56.523 --> 10:57.722
>> lying about his sister dying

10:57.724 --> 10:58.390
Of leukemia?

10:58.392 --> 11:01.159
>> I'm gonna get really upset.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.894
>> he's lied before.

11:02.896 --> 11:07.666
He's probably lying again.

11:07.668 --> 11:12.337
[knocking at the door]
>> hey, buddy.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.371
You ready to do this?

11:13.373 --> 11:14.039
>> yeah.

11:14.041 --> 11:14.939
>> got the old--

11:14.941 --> 11:16.007
>> I got the notebook.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.775
>> you got the notebook.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.510
>> the special <i>catfish</i> notebook.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.811
>> just gonna make a pit stop

11:19.813 --> 11:20.679
Right here.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.413
>> yup.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.014
Why don't you get your partner

11:23.016 --> 11:24.049
One of those too?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.083
Best part about being on the

11:25.085 --> 11:25.750
Road.

11:25.752 --> 11:26.418
>> cookie.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.485
>> the free cookies.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.453
>> cookie.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.487
>> I'm sensing this is not gonna

11:29.489 --> 11:30.989
Be a long investigation.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.891
We already know something's up.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.592
>> so you ready?

11:34.594 --> 11:37.896
[whooshing]

11:37.898 --> 11:39.597
So here's what we know so far--

11:39.599 --> 11:41.166
This guy used to be "cameryn."

11:41.168 --> 11:42.801
Miranda busted him.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.735
He was using pictures of some

11:43.737 --> 11:45.804
Guy in atlanta.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.238
He says now his name is james.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.606
He sent her new pictures.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.008
>> there's a chance he could be

11:50.010 --> 11:51.076
The guy from the new pictures,

11:51.078 --> 11:51.810
But it's unlikely.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.877
>> it seems unlikely.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.845
>> let's do the image search

11:53.847 --> 11:54.512
First.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.313
>> all right, here we go.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.715
First pic of james, the guy from

11:56.717 --> 11:59.718
The new pictures.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.453
>> both: Nothing.

12:01.455 --> 12:02.587
>> here's the second one.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.421
>> all right, number two,

12:03.423 --> 12:04.456
Number two, do I get a number

12:04.458 --> 12:05.123
Two?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.324
>> can I get a--uh, oh, oh.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.192
>> nothing.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.561
No hits on the pics.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.462
>> so then let's just do a

12:10.464 --> 12:12.397
Search for "james"...

12:12.399 --> 12:13.498
>> james [bleep].

12:13.500 --> 12:17.469
>> what do we got?

12:17.471 --> 12:21.039
There's a lot of facebook hits.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.474
This guy's in georgia.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.142
>> yeah, let's click on that.

12:24.144 --> 12:24.876
>> all right, here we go.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.844
We got some photos.

12:25.846 --> 12:26.878
There's not a lot.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.148
There's this guy.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.751
Here he is with his friends.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.485
All right, well, let's keep

12:33.487 --> 12:35.587
This guy as an option.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.988
Let's do a google search for

12:36.990 --> 12:39.524
"james [bleep]."

12:39.526 --> 12:40.325
Like that?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.392
>> yeah.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.594
>> whoa.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.428
>> did you see that?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.263
>> sex offender.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.232
>> what is that?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.533
>> there he is.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.334
Aliases.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.902
What do we have?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.737
James [bleep].

12:52.739 --> 12:54.572
>> yikes.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.541
>> "traveling to meet minor and

12:56.543 --> 12:58.676
Unlawful sexual offense."

12:58.678 --> 13:00.178
And she was basically a minor

13:00.180 --> 13:02.280
When they started talking.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.415
But look, "status: Confinement."

13:04.417 --> 13:05.950
He is confined to a state or

13:05.952 --> 13:08.052
Federal penitentiary.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.454
Well, maybe that's why he can't

13:09.456 --> 13:10.355
Meet her.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.157
>> that could be why.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.259
>> he's in jail!

13:14.261 --> 13:15.193
>> we know about this, remember.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.595
Like, you don't get countless

13:17.597 --> 13:18.897
Hours in the middle of the night

13:18.899 --> 13:19.964
And in the morning, you know, on

13:19.966 --> 13:20.665
The internet.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.133
Like, he's having a very

13:22.135 --> 13:23.735
Involved relationship.

13:23.737 --> 13:24.769
There's no way he's in prison.

13:24.771 --> 13:25.904
>> you don't know that.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.906
>> I think this is a dead end.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.574
Before we get lost, let's just

13:29.576 --> 13:31.843
Run the numbers.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.077
Here is james' current phone

13:33.079 --> 13:34.846
Number.

13:34.848 --> 13:35.713
>> come on, spokeo.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.514
I don't like it when you touch

13:36.516 --> 13:37.215
Me.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.249
I don't like it.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.217
I don't like it when you bring

13:39.219 --> 13:39.884
Me close to you.

13:39.886 --> 13:40.552
>> please, please.

13:40.554 --> 13:41.452
>> I don't like to feel your

Body warmth...

13:42.455 --> 13:43.121

13:43.123 --> 13:43.822
>> or the hair on your chest.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.257
>> give me a hit.

Who was born in 1991.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.239
>> lived in georgia.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.613
And one in quang ninh.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.614
>> well, that's in thailand.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.648
>> right.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.583
>> there's one.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.250
Georgia.

14:12.252 --> 14:12.917
>> oh, my god.

14:12.919 --> 14:13.785
>> boom.

14:13.787 --> 14:14.853
Click on it.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.254
>> oh, my god.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.923
Who is this?

14:18.925 --> 14:20.525
And look, there's relatives.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.728
James [bleep].

14:23.730 --> 14:26.898
Let's look up this guy.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.068
>> so this hang [bleep] lady

14:30.070 --> 14:32.670
Could be the mom of james.

14:32.672 --> 14:38.042
This is definitely a lead.

14:38.044 --> 14:38.776
>> yeah, the phone number's

14:38.778 --> 14:41.579
Registered to hang [bleep].

14:41.581 --> 14:43.982
Could be the mom of james.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.483
Let's just go over all this

14:45.485 --> 14:48.419
Stuff with miranda and then

14:48.421 --> 14:52.757
Come up with a strategy.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.926
I'm gonna cut this camera, okay?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.060
Cut it, tail slate.

14:56.062 --> 15:02.133
>> hello?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.468
>> good morning.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.837
>> what's going on?

15:05.839 --> 15:14.879
Hi, guys!

15:14.881 --> 15:15.546
>> hey.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.481
>> hi.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.148
>> hey, what's up?

15:17.150 --> 15:17.815
>> nice to meet you.

15:17.817 --> 15:18.483
I'm logan.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.183
>> jordan, this is the little

15:19.185 --> 15:19.851
Sister, right?

15:19.853 --> 15:20.785
>> but taller.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.452
>> yeah. [laughs]

15:21.454 --> 15:22.153
>> well, right, the big little

15:22.155 --> 15:23.187
Sister.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.623
Let's go over here a little bit.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.492
I mean, I know you're her

15:27.494 --> 15:28.760
Real-life best friend, but--

15:28.762 --> 15:29.494
>> yeah.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.261
>> yeah. [laughs]

15:30.263 --> 15:31.129
>> how would you say her

15:31.131 --> 15:32.997
Friendship with james compares

15:32.999 --> 15:34.132
To sort of your friendship with

15:34.134 --> 15:34.866
Her?

15:34.868 --> 15:36.100
>> I feel like some things I

15:36.102 --> 15:37.268
Might even know that james

15:37.270 --> 15:37.936
Knows, so...

15:37.938 --> 15:38.603
>> exactly.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.470
>> I do feel like their bond

15:39.472 --> 15:41.172
Could be stronger than mine and

15:41.174 --> 15:42.173
Hers.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.441
>> I'm not gonna lie.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.609
I've been like, "what are you

15:44.611 --> 15:45.510
Doing?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.312
You need to give up on this."

15:47.314 --> 15:48.813
And she's like, "no, I really

15:48.815 --> 15:51.182
Love this guy."

15:51.184 --> 15:52.450
>> yes.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.117
>> that's cute.

15:53.119 --> 15:53.785
>> yeah.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.452
>> you like it?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.219
>> yeah.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.088
>> yep, we need this one.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.690
>> [laughs]

15:58.692 --> 16:00.858
>> we spent the afternoon doing

16:00.860 --> 16:01.826
Research.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.995
If you want, we can all go now

16:03.997 --> 16:04.963
And kind of go over everything

16:04.965 --> 16:05.730
Together.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.798
>> I mean, they know everything,

16:06.800 --> 16:11.903
Ins and outs, so yeah.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.237
I'm ready.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.272
>> the first thing that we did

16:14.274 --> 16:15.440
Was just a straight-up facebook

16:15.442 --> 16:21.145
Search for "james [bleep]."

16:21.147 --> 16:22.347
Interestingly, someone from

16:22.349 --> 16:23.281
Georgia.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.983
He looks like a nice enough guy.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.785
So so far, our one option is not

16:27.787 --> 16:28.453
Bad.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.021
Not the guy in the pictures, but

16:30.023 --> 16:31.789
Not bad.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.692
Then the next thing is this.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.560
>> read what that says.

16:35.562 --> 16:41.532
>> sexual offender.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.601
>> we went to that page and it

16:43.603 --> 16:48.373
Brought us to this guy.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.208
And it says under his aliases,

16:50.210 --> 16:52.076
If you look at the last one, is

16:52.078 --> 16:55.947
"james [bleep]."

16:55.949 --> 16:58.383
>> this guy was arrested

16:58.385 --> 17:01.019
Soliciting or showing up to some

17:01.021 --> 17:02.787
Underage person's house with

17:02.789 --> 17:05.455
What seemed to be sexual intent.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.391
We don't have any specific

17:06.393 --> 17:08.358
Information to point to him

17:08.361 --> 17:10.361
Being the guy you're talking to.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.797
Showing you everything we found.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.699
This is probably a long shot,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.099
But it's a little too much to

17:16.102 --> 17:17.167
Ignore completely.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.069
>> exactly, yeah.

17:18.070 --> 17:18.903
>> but the next thing that we

17:18.905 --> 17:22.573
Did was we ran the phone number,

17:22.575 --> 17:24.041
And interestingly enough, when

17:24.044 --> 17:25.877
We do a reverse phone search, it

17:25.878 --> 17:28.012
Comes up registered to the name

17:28.013 --> 17:30.281
"hang [bleep]."

17:30.283 --> 17:32.183
So we did a search on facebook,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.719
And we found hang [bleep].

17:34.721 --> 17:37.021
Again, it's a female in georgia.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.791
>> with a son named james.

17:39.793 --> 17:40.491
>> wow.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.993
>> so we clicked on that.

17:41.995 --> 17:47.565
>> we found this guy.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.701
>> I mean, it's possible that,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.638
I guess he could be any of these

17:53.640 --> 17:55.273
People, and honestly, I don't

17:55.275 --> 17:57.041
Know how I'm gonna react or

17:57.043 --> 17:59.877
What's gonna happen really

17:59.879 --> 18:01.946
Until I actually am, like...

18:01.948 --> 18:02.780
>> face-to-face.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.715
>> face-to-face.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.151
>> there's no clear answers.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.152
>> so many options, though.

18:08.154 --> 18:08.820
>> right.

18:08.822 --> 18:09.787
>> it's crazy.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.289
>> I'm gonna stay open-minded,

18:11.291 --> 18:15.026
And I'm just ready to know.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.695
>> I could call him and see if

18:17.697 --> 18:21.065
He would be, finally, willing to

18:21.067 --> 18:23.201
Present himself and meet up.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.269
So what do you think?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.037
>> let's go.

18:26.039 --> 18:26.704
Call him.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.505
>> you want me to call him?

18:27.507 --> 18:28.639
>> yep.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.543
I'm nervous.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.945
>> we have no idea who james

18:33.947 --> 18:36.547
Might really be.

18:36.549 --> 18:42.053
>> he's calling, he's calling.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.621
>> he's calling, oh.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.690
[phone ringing]

18:45.692 --> 18:49.327
>> yeah, hi, is this james?

18:49.329 --> 18:53.131
>> hey, this is nev.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.966
I make a tv show called <i>catfish</i>

18:54.968 --> 18:57.135
<i>On mtv.</i>

18:57.137 --> 18:59.036
<i>>> okay, cool.</i>

18:59.038 --> 19:00.304
<i>I am making an episode right</i>

19:00.306 --> 19:04.008
<i>Now, and the purpose of this</i>

19:04.010 --> 19:05.776
<i>Episode is to help a young lady</i>

19:05.778 --> 19:10.448
<i>Named miranda meet you.</i>

19:10.450 --> 19:17.955
<i>>> well, what is your</i>

19:17.957 --> 19:18.623
<i>Hesitation?</i>

19:18.625 --> 19:21.626
<i>I mean, I can't imagine why you</i>

19:21.628 --> 19:23.127
<i>Wouldn't want to meet her if</i>

19:23.129 --> 19:24.295
<i>You do love her as much as you</i>

19:24.297 --> 19:28.533
<i>Say you do.</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:37.642
<i>>> if this girl is as important</i>

19:37.644 --> 19:39.510
<i>To you as you say she is, you</i>

19:39.512 --> 19:41.646
<i>Would find a way, and this is</i>

19:41.648 --> 19:43.514
<i>Probably your last chance</i>

19:43.516 --> 19:46.117
<i>Because if you--you know, if</i>

19:46.119 --> 19:48.553
<i>You let this opportunity go, I</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:49.787
<i>Think she's gonna have to move</i>

19:49.789 --> 19:50.454
<i>On.</i>

19:50.456 --> 19:52.523
<i>I mean, she deserves to be with</i>

19:52.525 --> 19:57.295
<i>Someone.</i>

19:57.297 --> 20:01.732
<i>>> where are you?</i>

20:01.734 --> 20:04.535
<i>>> so you're in atlanta, okay.</i>

20:04.537 --> 20:06.237
<i>You might be able to figure out</i>

20:06.239 --> 20:07.872
<i>A way to get some free time this</i>

20:07.874 --> 20:09.073
<i>Weekend if we were able to come</i>

20:09.075 --> 20:13.244
<i>Down to atlanta?</i>

20:13.246 --> 20:16.614
<i>>> if I were you, I would just</i>

20:16.616 --> 20:19.884
<i>Prepare to be really honest, and</i>

20:19.886 --> 20:21.385
<i>You'll probably feel a lot</i>

20:21.387 --> 20:22.687
<i>Better, and who knows what</i>

20:22.689 --> 20:24.422
<i>Could happen?</i>

20:24.424 --> 20:31.195
<i>>> yeah, thank you, james.</i>

20:31.197 --> 20:32.597
<i>>> what'd he say?</i>

20:32.599 --> 20:34.765
<i>>> he is in atlanta, so that's</i>

20:34.767 --> 20:35.466
<i>True.</i>

20:35.468 --> 20:36.400
<i>>> okay.</i>

20:36.402 --> 20:37.602
<i>>> he's like, "okay, I will</i>

20:37.604 --> 20:38.669
<i>Meet her.</i>

20:38.671 --> 20:40.304
<i>I do want to meet her."</i>

20:40.306 --> 20:41.772
<i>We can fly down there this</i>

20:41.774 --> 20:43.040
<i>Weekend.</i>

20:43.042 --> 20:45.409
<i>>> I really hope that it's this</i>

20:45.411 --> 20:48.212
<i>Picture that I have.</i>

20:48.214 --> 20:49.146
<i>>> if you had to decide right</i>

20:49.148 --> 20:50.514
<i>Now if you think it's him or</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:52.183
<i>Not, what is your instinct?</i>

20:52.185 --> 20:55.987
<i>>> that it is this time, but I</i>

20:55.989 --> 20:57.121
<i>Need to know.</i>

20:57.123 --> 20:58.990
<i>I need to know.</i>

20:58.992 --> 21:01.292
<i>[laughs]</i>

21:01.294 --> 21:02.994
<i>I'm nervous now.</i>

21:02.996 --> 21:04.295
<i>>> [laughs]</i>

21:04.297 --> 21:04.962
<i>So let's get moving.</i>

21:04.964 --> 21:07.198
<i>>> yes, yeah.</i>

Her to come.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.614
>> we're gonna treat this like a

40:51.616 --> 40:52.649
Military operation.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.083
I've been waiting three seasons

40:54.085 --> 40:55.051
For this moment.

40:55.053 --> 40:55.785
Just hope I don't scare her

40:55.787 --> 40:56.486
Away.

40:56.488 --> 40:57.520
All right, this is it.

40:57.522 --> 40:58.621
Now we're really getting into

40:58.623 --> 41:00.223
The catfish creepy mode.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.558
I assume she's coming from that

41:01.560 --> 41:02.225
Way.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.393
Wait, wait, wait, guys.

41:03.395 --> 41:04.494
This could be it.
