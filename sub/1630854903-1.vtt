WEBVTT

05:13.795 --> 05:17.295
Could you hand me my shirt, baby girl?
I oughta get going.

05:17.628 --> 05:20.836
Come on.
Stay a little longer.

05:22.170 --> 05:25.003
What about round two?
- You for real?

05:25.170 --> 05:26.336
What?

05:26.503 --> 05:30.628
You all outta mojo?
- Hell, you tryin' to kill me, woman?

05:34.170 --> 05:36.336
Don't you want to stay with me?

05:36.711 --> 05:40.295
You know it, baby girl.
But the goats need lovin', too.

05:40.461 --> 05:43.253
Folks don't call me Goat Peter
for nothing.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.878
Very funny.

05:46.503 --> 05:48.170
There you go.

05:52.170 --> 05:53.586
Hey.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.336
Heidi!

06:23.003 --> 06:26.336
You've been visiting Goat Peter again!

06:27.461 --> 06:29.378
And how was your day?
- Look.

06:29.545 --> 06:33.503
That boy is trouble, I'm telling you.
- Here we go again.

06:33.836 --> 06:36.920
Boys his age,
they got one thing on their mind.

06:37.253 --> 06:40.420
So you just stay away from him
before you get hurt.

06:40.586 --> 06:44.003
I know,
but I just so happen to like him a lot.

06:44.586 --> 06:47.253
And I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

06:48.878 --> 06:52.836
You know,
I only want what's best for you.

06:54.003 --> 06:56.128
You're all I have.

06:56.586 --> 06:58.378
Can we just eat, Grandfather?

07:11.086 --> 07:13.920
They say he's involved
in some shady business.

07:14.086 --> 07:16.461
They? Who's they?
- In the village!

07:16.628 --> 07:19.711
How about trusting
your own granddaughter's judgment

07:19.878 --> 07:22.420
instead of some old hag's gossip?
- Heidi!

07:23.670 --> 07:26.378
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

07:29.211 --> 07:32.711
Goat Peter and I love each other.
And that's that.

07:38.003 --> 07:40.211
My dear, dear Heidi.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.670
If only you knew.

08:26.878 --> 08:27.920
You the guy?

08:28.920 --> 08:30.878
I'm the guy, alright.

08:35.128 --> 08:37.711
Straight to business.
I like it.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.461
Rich, creamy,

08:54.295 --> 08:55.461
smooth texture,

08:56.795 --> 08:57.920
exquisite taste.

08:58.253 --> 09:00.711
This goat cheese
is truly out of this world.

09:00.878 --> 09:04.045
Nothing like the crap
they used to sell in the cities.

09:09.378 --> 09:11.420
So it's true what they say about you.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.795
Happy goats...

09:14.961 --> 09:16.836
make happy cheese.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.336
<i>Grüezi, Swiss citizens.</i>

09:22.503 --> 09:26.378
<i>This is a special message
from our Very Swiss Leader.</i>

09:26.545 --> 09:29.711
<i>Today's topic: Nutrition and patriotism.</i>

09:30.628 --> 09:32.045
<i>What could be better</i>

09:32.211 --> 09:35.420
<i>than delicious, cheesy,
traditional Swiss home cooking?</i>

09:35.586 --> 09:37.670
Thanks, honey. Smells delicious.

09:38.003 --> 09:41.753
<i>And what could be worse
than someone who doesn't eat it?</i>

09:43.878 --> 09:47.086
<i>Lactose intolerance
is a threat from within.</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:51.503
<i>One that will smother the Swiss way
of life if we allow it to continue.</i>

09:52.045 --> 09:56.586
<i>Whenever you observe anyone
acting suspiciously lactose intolerant,</i>

09:56.753 --> 09:58.711
<i>call 1-800-LACTOSE!</i>

10:00.586 --> 10:02.920
I'm doing my part.

10:03.628 --> 10:04.628
<i>Your colleague.</i>

10:10.170 --> 10:11.711
I'm doing my part.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.003
<i>Or your girlfriend.</i>

10:16.128 --> 10:18.545
I'm doing my part.

10:19.253 --> 10:20.920
Are you doing your part?

10:21.086 --> 10:23.878
Keep Switzerland
free of lactose intolerance!

10:24.378 --> 10:27.586
<i>Call 1-800-LACTOSE! Anonymity guaranteed.</i>

10:27.753 --> 10:30.211
<i>This message is brought to you
by Meili's Cheese Co.</i>

10:34.128 --> 10:36.795
I look <i>fantastisch</i>.

10:36.961 --> 10:40.086
Good work, Gutzweiler!
- Thank you, my Very Swiss Leader.

10:40.253 --> 10:42.378
I'm very proud of the results.

10:44.086 --> 10:47.003
It could definitely use
some sexy girls, though.

10:47.461 --> 10:51.461
Okay. That is enough praise for today.
Anything else you have for me?

10:52.378 --> 10:54.961
Good news, sir. The French.

10:55.295 --> 10:57.878
They are ready to agree
to our export terms.

10:58.628 --> 10:59.753
But...

11:00.920 --> 11:02.586
My Very Swiss Leader.

11:04.836 --> 11:06.128
I am...

11:41.920 --> 11:44.878
You are one minute and 52 seconds late.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.753
This is not Swaziland.
This is Switzerland!

11:50.086 --> 11:51.836
My sincere apologies.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.461
Apologies?

11:54.753 --> 11:57.836
You are hereby relieved of your duties.
Guards!

12:12.170 --> 12:14.003
Anyway. Where were we?

12:14.503 --> 12:16.045
The French, sir.

12:16.211 --> 12:19.628
They insist on sending
a delegation of food inspectors

12:19.795 --> 12:23.961
to see if we meet their standards
before they make a final decision.

12:24.128 --> 12:27.711
You know the French.
They love their cheese.

12:28.253 --> 12:33.170
Those Brie-eating bastards
want to lecture me about cheese?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.670
Who do they think they are?

12:37.170 --> 12:42.170
Maybe I should invite them
to the National Day celebration.

12:48.628 --> 12:52.420
So... how is the Ultra Swiss cheese
coming along?

12:52.586 --> 12:56.586
Ah, very good, sir. I think
you will be very pleased with the results.

12:57.045 --> 12:58.378
Good.

12:59.295 --> 13:01.170
First France...

13:03.003 --> 13:04.003
and then...

13:04.336 --> 13:05.420
the world!

13:23.295 --> 13:26.295
I heard someone ordered fondue.

13:27.628 --> 13:32.086
Oh, I love the smell of cheese
in the morning.

13:46.503 --> 13:50.420
That wasn't so bad, now, was it?

13:50.961 --> 13:52.295
Please.

13:53.045 --> 13:54.878
No more cheese.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.253
I can't take it.

13:57.586 --> 14:01.045
I am lactose intolerant.

14:01.211 --> 14:03.503
Of course you are.

14:03.836 --> 14:05.545
You filthy foreign fuck!

14:06.586 --> 14:09.086
Well, who is your supplier?

14:10.378 --> 14:12.836
His name is G...

14:13.170 --> 14:14.586
G... G... G...

14:14.753 --> 14:17.211
G... G... G... G... G... G...

14:17.378 --> 14:19.295
Goat Peter.

14:24.211 --> 14:27.003
And where can we find this Goat Peter?

14:27.961 --> 14:29.545
The Alps.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.503
The village above Davos.

14:33.086 --> 14:35.170
Tomorrow.
Please.

14:36.003 --> 14:39.503
I told you what you want to know.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.211
You promised to let me go.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.170
I did. But first...

14:46.003 --> 14:48.836
How about some chocolate for dessert?

15:13.420 --> 15:15.086
Goat Peter!

16:09.211 --> 16:10.336
There you go.

16:15.836 --> 16:18.128
Wait here. I'll be right back.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.211
I love you, Goat Peter.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.253
I love you too, baby girl.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.211
Definitely our goat fucker.

17:02.378 --> 17:06.378
This man has been charged
with the production,

17:06.545 --> 17:09.878
sales and distribution
of illegal dairy products.

17:10.670 --> 17:16.753
Let this be a lesson to you all.
Traitors get what they deserve.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.961
Noooooo!

17:35.128 --> 17:37.336
And who might you be?

17:37.503 --> 17:39.420
Take her away!
- Come with us!

17:45.003 --> 17:47.336
Meili's gonna love this one.

17:49.670 --> 17:52.336
Don't let her get away. Quick!

17:59.836 --> 18:03.545
See, what did I tell you?
They've been down to the village again.

18:03.711 --> 18:06.670
Just wait 'til I give him
a piece of my mind.

18:18.086 --> 18:19.670
Grandfather!

18:41.211 --> 18:43.836
Did you really think
you could get away from me?

18:45.170 --> 18:47.045
Leave the girl alone.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.795
Mind your own business, old man.
It's better for your health.

18:51.961 --> 18:54.211
I said... leave her alone, Knorr!

18:54.545 --> 18:56.920
Or I'll blow your fucking head off.

18:58.211 --> 19:00.503
Wait a minute. Alpöhi?

19:00.836 --> 19:03.586
Is it really you?
- You better believe it.

19:03.753 --> 19:06.753
Get on your merry way
and forget you ever saw the girl!

19:06.920 --> 19:10.836
She's yours?
This just keeps getting better and better.

19:13.711 --> 19:15.170
Final warning!

19:15.503 --> 19:18.378
Your pathetic rebellion
failed a long time ago.

19:23.711 --> 19:25.378
Grandfather!

20:22.170 --> 20:23.753
Don't bother.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.628
It's pointless.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.086
Where are they taking us?

20:32.128 --> 20:33.628
I don't know.

20:43.753 --> 20:45.253
My name is Klara.

20:48.295 --> 20:49.628
What's yours?

21:09.878 --> 21:11.628
Fräulein Rottweiler.

21:16.878 --> 21:18.586
This is the one.

21:20.086 --> 21:21.961
I'm rather unimpressed.

21:22.503 --> 21:25.711
Meili is gonna love her.
You'll see.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.795
Is that so?

21:33.253 --> 21:34.503
Lutz!

21:39.295 --> 21:42.128
You are now property of the Fatherland.

21:42.461 --> 21:45.670
Welcome to Camp Alpenblick!

21:58.336 --> 21:59.420
Next.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.253
Next.

22:03.503 --> 22:04.628
Next.

22:08.378 --> 22:10.003
Well...

22:12.295 --> 22:13.836
Open up.

22:24.545 --> 22:27.128
As suspected.
Lactose intolerant.

22:33.295 --> 22:34.295
Guards!

22:37.253 --> 22:39.253
Never mind that one.

22:48.753 --> 22:50.378
Good. Next.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.295
Well, hello.

23:02.836 --> 23:06.003
Open!
- I'm fine, thank you very much.

23:07.045 --> 23:08.961
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

23:17.211 --> 23:20.836
I see. Spirited, aren't you, huh?

23:23.045 --> 23:27.336
I could do this all day long.
What about you?

23:29.503 --> 23:31.128
Watch out.

23:51.503 --> 23:55.503
The way you were resisting, I was certain
that you would be intolerant.

24:16.336 --> 24:19.003
Oh. Fresh meat.

24:24.211 --> 24:25.795
Just ignore them.

24:31.253 --> 24:33.045
This is Rosie.

24:33.628 --> 24:35.753
She's all bite and no bark.

24:38.003 --> 24:42.545
Me and you, we're going to have
a real good time together.

24:42.711 --> 24:43.711
<i>Quiet in there!</i>

24:49.711 --> 24:51.045
<i>Lights out!</i>

25:06.586 --> 25:08.711
I'm gonna make them pay.

25:09.545 --> 25:11.045
I promise you.

25:27.211 --> 25:29.378
I'm scared. Aren't you?

25:33.211 --> 25:35.128
I gotta get out of here.

25:36.045 --> 25:39.628
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta come up with something.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.461
Klara, you hear me?

25:44.628 --> 25:46.545
We need to stick together.

25:50.211 --> 25:53.211
Even if we managed
to sneak past the guards,

25:53.378 --> 25:55.211
how would we make it out of here?

25:56.420 --> 26:00.003
I mean... We don't even know where we are.

26:00.170 --> 26:01.795
We'll find a way.

26:02.503 --> 26:03.503
We have to.

26:03.670 --> 26:05.003
<i>Quiet!</i>

26:09.753 --> 26:11.253
Good night, Klara.

26:12.461 --> 26:13.753
Good night.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.711
Good morning, ladies.

26:29.295 --> 26:31.711
Good morning, Fräulein Rottweiler!

26:32.836 --> 26:34.586
Congratulations,

26:34.753 --> 26:36.295
new arrivals.

26:36.670 --> 26:39.170
You are the chosen ones!

26:39.878 --> 26:41.586
As you all know...

26:41.753 --> 26:46.295
Schwingen,
also known as Alpine Wrestling,

26:46.628 --> 26:49.961
is our nation's most popular sport.

26:50.586 --> 26:53.670
Today you begin your training!

26:55.128 --> 26:56.295
Lutz!

26:56.670 --> 26:59.086
As there are some newbies here,

26:59.628 --> 27:01.503
we'll start with the basics.

27:06.211 --> 27:07.503
You!

27:13.003 --> 27:14.253
And you.

27:15.170 --> 27:16.795
Into the ring!

27:23.753 --> 27:26.711
We start
with the basic moves of Schwingen!

27:26.878 --> 27:30.878
The "kurz" is the most commonly used grip
on the Schwing court.

27:31.628 --> 27:32.628
Go!

27:53.128 --> 27:56.045
Enough! You're going to kill her!
- Alright!

27:56.461 --> 27:57.961
Get back in line!

28:03.378 --> 28:05.420
Let's see if there's some talent

28:05.586 --> 28:07.753
behind that big mouth of yours.

28:08.961 --> 28:09.961
You.

28:18.545 --> 28:20.961
The next move is the "wyberhaagge".

28:21.628 --> 28:24.128
Not only because of its name,

28:24.295 --> 28:27.253
it is one of the more spectacular swings.

28:30.461 --> 28:32.545
I told you we're gonna have fun.

28:55.086 --> 28:58.336
Found any fishes down there?
No? Check again!

29:04.878 --> 29:07.128
Attention! Stand straight.

29:12.378 --> 29:14.711
You, you, you. Out!

29:16.170 --> 29:19.711
We'll continue the swimming lessons
tomorrow, Bambi.

29:39.920 --> 29:43.045
I present to you our Very Swiss Leader,
President Meili.

30:01.586 --> 30:04.003
Oh. That is what it's like.

30:05.045 --> 30:08.545
Not too shabby at all.
I'm starting to like this place.

30:09.670 --> 30:11.128
Anyway. Knorrli!

30:11.295 --> 30:12.878
It's Kommandant Knorr!

30:14.253 --> 30:16.711
That's the one.
Maienfeld, Adelheid.

30:16.878 --> 30:18.628
24 years old.

30:19.003 --> 30:21.086
Granddaughter of Alpöhi.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.503
Recently deceased.
I took care of that personally...

30:33.795 --> 30:36.961
Ooh! Quite the lively one.

30:38.711 --> 30:41.086
I like that look on your face.

30:42.420 --> 30:45.878
That starry-eyed cluelessness
one only find in the Alps.

30:47.461 --> 30:48.586
Perfect.

30:54.378 --> 30:58.003
I am positively surprised,
Kommandant Knorr.

30:58.795 --> 31:01.586
I did not expect that from you.

31:02.253 --> 31:07.295
Anyway, I have got important things to do.
Cow business, if you know what I mean.

31:12.336 --> 31:13.711
The girl.

31:13.878 --> 31:18.670
I want her to be the main attraction.
This'll be the best Schwing fest in years.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.170
Of course, sir, I have...

32:00.461 --> 32:02.295
I've had it with cheese.

32:03.295 --> 32:05.170
Isn't there anything else?

32:05.503 --> 32:07.503
Oh, let me check.

32:07.670 --> 32:10.878
Oh, no. Just cheese.
Take it or leave it.

32:15.003 --> 32:17.378
<i>All prisoners pick up your meals.</i>

32:30.045 --> 32:31.670
What's the problem, Bambi?

32:31.836 --> 32:34.003
I'm not eating that crap.

32:34.336 --> 32:37.295
Ooh. Are you suddenly lactose intolerant?

32:42.128 --> 32:45.045
Stuff your fat faces
with that garbage all you want.

32:45.378 --> 32:48.170
I'd rather starve to death
than end up as one of you.

32:51.336 --> 32:53.753
Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

33:08.545 --> 33:10.836
Anyone else wants some?

33:13.795 --> 33:15.253
And these two...

33:16.295 --> 33:17.461
Take 'em away!

33:49.086 --> 33:53.128
How the hell did she get that in here?

33:53.961 --> 33:58.336
I have had it
with your sloppy strip searches.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.378
I expect better.

34:00.961 --> 34:03.461
Yes, ma'am, Fräulein Rottweiler.

34:13.086 --> 34:16.086
Oh, is that how you want to play it?

34:16.878 --> 34:18.170
Very well!

34:18.503 --> 34:23.003
In just a few days, you'll be
on your knees, begging for cheese.

35:00.336 --> 35:04.461
<i>In Switzerland, in Switzerland
In Switzerland...</i>

35:35.586 --> 35:37.670
What a pain in the ass!

35:39.211 --> 35:41.670
Woof, woof, woof.

35:41.836 --> 35:43.336
Pugsie!

35:43.503 --> 35:45.378
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

35:45.545 --> 35:48.086
You truly are insatiable, hm?

35:48.545 --> 35:50.128
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

35:50.461 --> 35:51.878
Very well.

36:17.420 --> 36:18.961
Smell that?

36:19.128 --> 36:23.003
All the delicious cheese.

36:33.795 --> 36:35.545
Till tomorrow!

36:48.045 --> 36:51.211
<i>You've been visiting Goat Peter again.</i>

36:51.378 --> 36:54.545
<i>Lunch is getting cold.</i>

37:00.045 --> 37:01.878
<i>Smell that?</i>

37:02.211 --> 37:04.420
<i>I love you, too, baby girl.</i>

37:04.586 --> 37:06.003
<i>Delicious cheese...</i>

37:06.170 --> 37:07.420
What are you staring at?

37:07.586 --> 37:08.711
<i>Delicious cheese.</i>

37:09.045 --> 37:10.795
<i>Lunch is getting cold.</i>

37:11.711 --> 37:13.503
<i>Don't you want some?</i>

37:31.836 --> 37:33.586
Grandfather?

37:57.753 --> 37:58.961
For fuck's sake!

37:59.586 --> 38:02.003
I should have you all arrested.

38:03.336 --> 38:06.128
I'm sure it's just a...
- matter of logistics.

38:06.295 --> 38:10.795
That is what you told me the last time.
Yet here we are, you've nothing to show.

38:12.086 --> 38:13.961
Some more milk.

38:22.670 --> 38:24.128
My Very Swiss Leader,

38:24.461 --> 38:27.920
I promise you,
your new Ultra Swiss cheese

38:28.086 --> 38:31.670
will be ready
in time for Swiss National Day.

38:32.961 --> 38:34.503
It better be

38:34.670 --> 38:38.128
because you are hanging
on a really thin thread,

38:38.461 --> 38:39.545
Schwitzgebel!

38:41.545 --> 38:43.253
Speaking of Swiss National Day...

38:43.920 --> 38:46.836
How is the mountain girl doing?
- Oh...

38:48.128 --> 38:51.295
Very promising.
You were right to choose her.

38:52.086 --> 38:56.711
Good. You would not disappoint me,
would you, Knorrli?

38:57.878 --> 39:00.545
I wouldn't dare, sir. You know me.

39:03.170 --> 39:04.795
I do indeed.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.628
Gentlemen.

39:10.420 --> 39:14.253
To world domination!
- To world domination!

39:26.336 --> 39:27.753
Rottweiler.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.961
Finally!
Meili is getting impatient.

39:31.128 --> 39:35.211
If the girl doesn't deliver at the fest,
he'll have our heads on a platter.

39:36.295 --> 39:39.420
You are giving me orders, Pugsie?

39:39.586 --> 39:40.836
Damn right I am.

39:41.336 --> 39:45.378
That almost sounds
like you are questioning my abilities.

39:45.545 --> 39:47.545
I don't care how you do it.

39:47.711 --> 39:49.753
Just make it happen!

39:59.045 --> 40:00.503
You know...

40:00.836 --> 40:02.586
I'm so glad...

40:04.128 --> 40:05.753
that you didn't listen.

40:09.211 --> 40:10.753
Because...

40:11.170 --> 40:12.795
I'm going to enjoy this...

40:13.545 --> 40:15.461
very much.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.045
It's party time, bitch.

41:05.836 --> 41:09.003
I think she's had enough.

41:09.170 --> 41:12.003
Give us a minute, will you?

41:21.503 --> 41:25.128
You know...
I'm not as bad as you think I am.

41:26.128 --> 41:30.420
I really do care about my girls,
especially you, Heidi.

41:30.586 --> 41:33.045
I only want what's best for you.

41:34.545 --> 41:39.045
Sometimes that requires
a little bit of tough love.

41:39.378 --> 41:42.586
But tough love is still love.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.586
Wouldn't you agree?

41:46.086 --> 41:50.128
Anyway. I've got you a little something...

41:50.795 --> 41:52.086
to cheer you up.

42:00.628 --> 42:05.086
Now how about you have
a little something to eat? Hmm?

42:06.170 --> 42:07.711
What do you say?

42:14.961 --> 42:16.378
Such a good girl.

42:38.628 --> 42:40.795
I'm not a good girl anymore.

42:51.711 --> 42:52.711
Time to leave.

42:56.545 --> 42:58.711
Why?
- I got keys.

42:59.045 --> 43:00.045
Cheese?

43:00.378 --> 43:03.253
No, keys!
We can finally get the hell out of here!

43:03.586 --> 43:06.086
But it's going to be breakfast soon.

43:06.461 --> 43:07.920
Wait, what?

43:08.961 --> 43:11.545
What the hell are you on about?
We gotta hurry.

43:11.711 --> 43:13.670
I need my daily cheese

43:13.836 --> 43:16.461
so I can be big and strong...

43:16.628 --> 43:20.753
and become Switzerland's next top
Schwinger for our Very Swiss Leader.

43:21.670 --> 43:24.128
For fuck's sake, Klara, snap out of it!

43:28.086 --> 43:29.295
Fuck!

43:34.420 --> 43:37.086
Goddamn it, Klara, get up!
I can't do this alone!

43:37.836 --> 43:39.295
I'm leaving.

43:40.628 --> 43:42.336
I'll fix this. I promise.

44:04.128 --> 44:05.628
Ruthli!

44:57.086 --> 44:58.628
This way!

45:24.545 --> 45:28.253
There's nowhere for you to run, Heidi.

45:29.628 --> 45:32.836
Unless you want to join
the rest of your family.

45:34.586 --> 45:35.836
What?

45:41.211 --> 45:43.545
Your grandfather never told you?

45:44.670 --> 45:48.461
I made sure your parents
got what they deserve.

45:49.253 --> 45:51.836
And now it's your turn.

45:52.003 --> 45:55.128
It would be my pleasure to reunite you

45:55.461 --> 45:58.711
and to once again see
that look on a face I saw

45:58.878 --> 46:04.420
when I drained the life out of
your whore mother and your deadbeat dad.

46:05.670 --> 46:09.045
All your sheltered life in the mountains

46:09.211 --> 46:12.378
still led your right into my arms.

46:12.545 --> 46:15.878
You know, personally,
I couldn't give a rat's ass

46:16.211 --> 46:19.211
how much Meili
wants you at his Schwing fest.

46:21.003 --> 46:23.545
So, which will it be?

46:32.045 --> 46:34.628
You do not control my destiny.

46:39.795 --> 46:41.253
God damn her!

47:03.545 --> 47:05.753
Knorrli, I did not expect you here today.

47:05.920 --> 47:10.545
I've got some unfortunate news
that I wanted to tell you in person, sir.

47:12.586 --> 47:14.586
It's the mountain girl, Heidi.

47:16.461 --> 47:18.420
Get to the point.
I haven't got all day.

47:20.420 --> 47:22.086
She's dead.

47:23.045 --> 47:24.378
She's what?

47:25.045 --> 47:26.670
Killed herself.

47:27.961 --> 47:30.003
Un-fucking-believable!

47:31.461 --> 47:34.503
How could you let this happen?
You incompetent fuck!

47:34.836 --> 47:38.211
How hard can it be,
guarding a fucking girl?

47:38.545 --> 47:40.836
We couldn't...
- Shut the fuck up!

47:41.253 --> 47:43.336
We will deal with this later.

50:04.420 --> 50:09.211
My Very Swiss Leader, it's a great honor
to show you the culmination of my work:

50:09.545 --> 50:10.628
Meili's

50:10.961 --> 50:11.961
Ultra

50:12.170 --> 50:13.170
Swiss.

50:14.003 --> 50:17.670
None of this would be possible
without your brilliant plan

50:17.836 --> 50:20.878
for the future of Switz...
- Blow that smoke up your own ass.

50:21.503 --> 50:25.378
Are we going to see results or not?
- Of course, my Very Swiss Leader.

50:31.545 --> 50:33.045
Oh, hello there.

50:33.711 --> 50:35.211
Cheesemaster.

50:36.961 --> 50:40.545
I managed to increase
the lactose proportion

50:40.878 --> 50:44.670
to no less than 88%.

50:45.461 --> 50:46.961
With this new formula,

50:47.295 --> 50:51.336
we can not only reach peak muscle mass
upon short term consumption,

50:51.670 --> 50:54.128
but also peak cerebral softening,

50:54.461 --> 50:57.503
which will result
in near total lack of linguistic skills

50:57.836 --> 51:00.295
and renders the consumer

51:00.628 --> 51:02.836
unconditionally obedient.

51:06.670 --> 51:09.836
Good God,
spare me the scientific mumbo jumbo!

51:10.461 --> 51:13.211
Try speaking
like a normal person for once.

51:13.378 --> 51:15.336
Well, as you would put it, sir,

51:15.878 --> 51:18.420
it's going to make everyone dumb as fuck.

51:18.670 --> 51:22.253
Talk is cheap. Show me!
- Of course, my Very Swiss Leader.

51:23.253 --> 51:27.836
Kari here will have the honor
to sample the new Ultra Swiss.

51:38.211 --> 51:40.628
Oh...
- Go ahead, Kari.

51:49.003 --> 51:51.295
Unbelievably delicious.

51:52.795 --> 51:54.961
Best I've ever eaten.

51:59.003 --> 52:00.878
Well, don't stop now.

52:01.045 --> 52:03.086
It's... But it's...

52:05.586 --> 52:06.878
It's...

52:07.420 --> 52:08.545
It's what?

52:10.545 --> 52:11.586
Come on, spill it!

52:13.211 --> 52:15.211
Cerebral softening, sir.

52:16.753 --> 52:18.420
You also said obedience.

52:19.086 --> 52:20.586
I did indeed. Try it.

52:23.336 --> 52:24.711
Stand straight.

52:32.836 --> 52:34.878
Show me how strong you are.

52:38.836 --> 52:42.211
What, what, what, what? No!

52:44.920 --> 52:47.545
M... Meili! Do something!
- Not him, you idiot!

53:07.836 --> 53:10.836
Sir, I... I'm terribly sorry.

53:11.170 --> 53:13.128
I promise you, I...
- I...

53:16.670 --> 53:18.170
love it!

53:19.461 --> 53:21.878
You crazy genius!

53:23.295 --> 53:27.003
You've created
the perfect Swiss super soldier!

53:38.295 --> 53:42.545
I guess the position
for propaganda minister just opened up.

53:48.461 --> 53:51.211
Sir. You can't be serious.

53:51.545 --> 53:53.753
This thing is supposed to be a soldier?

53:54.086 --> 53:56.295
I don't see how...
- Of course you don't.

53:56.461 --> 53:59.670
You and your soldiers
can't even handle a little girl.

54:00.628 --> 54:03.211
The future is now, old man!

54:06.545 --> 54:08.961
Produce as much of it as you can!

54:09.753 --> 54:12.420
Of course, my Very Swiss Leader.

54:23.086 --> 54:26.295
You may leave whenever you please.

54:26.628 --> 54:29.086
The weapons, they stay.

54:48.503 --> 54:52.711
I am Helvetia, Guardian of the Motherland.

54:55.170 --> 54:58.503
Lust for vengeance
flows through your veins.

54:58.670 --> 55:01.545
Many things you shall learn,
young cub.

55:12.378 --> 55:13.545
Forget joy,

55:13.878 --> 55:15.545
forget sorrow,

55:15.711 --> 55:18.253
forget love, forget hate.

55:18.836 --> 55:21.378
Follow the whispering leaves

55:21.545 --> 55:24.920
and the call of the mountain goat.

55:32.961 --> 55:36.378
Meili's blood's gonna boil
when he sees that one.

55:38.753 --> 55:41.461
I hope he gets
a motherfucking heart attack.

55:45.086 --> 55:47.670
Easy now! It's only me.

55:49.170 --> 55:50.795
Alpöhi?

55:54.711 --> 55:59.711
You got some nerve showing up
on my doorstep after all these years.

56:03.795 --> 56:05.545
Knorr killed your boy.

56:07.128 --> 56:09.420
What the hell you talkin' about?

56:11.795 --> 56:12.836
Goat Peter?

56:17.795 --> 56:19.545
My beautiful boy?

56:20.170 --> 56:23.920
And now he's after my Heidi,
so I'm going to kill the bastard.

56:24.086 --> 56:26.045
And I need your help.

56:28.670 --> 56:33.003
You want us three old guys to...
go after Knorr,

56:34.253 --> 56:37.211
without even knowing where to go,
or what we're up against?

56:37.545 --> 56:39.295
Is this what you're saying?

56:41.336 --> 56:42.753
Exactly.

56:44.670 --> 56:46.295
Alright...

56:47.295 --> 56:50.628
let's go tear that motherfucker
a new asshole.

1:00:45.670 --> 1:00:49.545
I knew I'd find you in here.
As predictable as a good old Swiss watch.

1:00:50.295 --> 1:00:51.670
My Very Swiss Leader.

1:00:52.003 --> 1:00:56.878
Stop moping around, Knorrli.
There's plenty enough boots left to lick.

1:00:57.753 --> 1:01:00.795
You actually look pretty good
sitting behind that desk.

1:01:00.961 --> 1:01:04.461
Who knows, I might have to "promote" you
to prison warden.

1:01:05.003 --> 1:01:06.003
What?

1:01:06.336 --> 1:01:08.920
Relax! I'm just fucking with you.

1:01:10.878 --> 1:01:15.670
Although... I did tell you
to not disappoint me, remember?

1:01:16.378 --> 1:01:18.045
Of course, sir.

1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:23.461
My staff informed me that these are
the two most promising candidates.

1:01:26.503 --> 1:01:27.836
That's it.

1:01:28.170 --> 1:01:30.170
Those two?
Is this your idea of a joke?

1:01:30.503 --> 1:01:35.128
They are fierce warriors and more than...
- I wanted the fucking mountain girl.

1:01:35.295 --> 1:01:38.003
You let her get away.
- She didn't get away.

1:01:38.336 --> 1:01:40.170
She died.
- Whatever, Knorrli.

1:01:40.336 --> 1:01:43.961
This year's fest was destined
for the history books. Now it's just...

1:01:44.503 --> 1:01:48.086
Sir, there is a soldier
who insists on speaking to you.

1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:51.586
Herr... Herr Kommandant!

1:01:54.961 --> 1:01:56.045
Herr Kommandant.

1:01:57.253 --> 1:01:59.753
Our patrol was attacked.

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.128
We didn't stand a chance.

1:02:03.836 --> 1:02:07.170
Get a grip on yourself, soldier.
Now what happened?

1:02:07.336 --> 1:02:10.670
We were... just finishing lunch.

1:02:11.878 --> 1:02:14.378
Suddenly there was this noise.

1:02:34.253 --> 1:02:36.128
That's not a weapon.

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:41.003
This is.

1:02:41.545 --> 1:02:44.920
She... She left me alive
to give you a message.

1:02:45.461 --> 1:02:46.878
She?

1:02:47.253 --> 1:02:48.336
She said...

1:02:48.961 --> 1:02:50.503
Death to the Fatherland!

1:03:00.003 --> 1:03:01.670
Knorrli!

1:03:04.086 --> 1:03:06.170
Are you telling me she did this?

1:03:07.586 --> 1:03:09.628
The fucking mountain girl?

1:03:09.795 --> 1:03:12.211
Not only is she not dead,

1:03:12.545 --> 1:03:15.378
she's also massacring
your goddamn soldiers?

1:03:16.211 --> 1:03:19.211
This is your last goddamn chance.

1:03:19.795 --> 1:03:21.336
You better fucking fix this!

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:34.170
Summon the Neutralizer.

1:03:54.753 --> 1:03:56.961
I'm out of ink.

1:03:57.961 --> 1:04:00.670
<i>Just take the ink pad
from the other stamp.</i>

1:04:01.211 --> 1:04:03.128
What other stamp?

1:04:21.628 --> 1:04:23.045
Right away.

1:04:44.586 --> 1:04:48.003
Long live our Very Swiss Leader.
- Alright, fuck off!

1:04:57.295 --> 1:04:58.836
Got you, fucker!

1:05:08.836 --> 1:05:11.295
Right. This should be the last one.

1:05:12.003 --> 1:05:14.253
Time for a break.
- Well, well, well...

1:05:15.045 --> 1:05:17.628
Something's yodeling in my pants.

1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:23.003
I wouldn't push her off my bed,
that's for sure.

1:05:26.003 --> 1:05:28.836
I heard she took down an entire squad.

1:05:29.170 --> 1:05:31.670
I wish I could be the one to find her.

1:05:32.336 --> 1:05:36.878
I'd teach her some real good manners,
if you know what I mean.

1:05:38.086 --> 1:05:41.336
That's some real big talk
for such puny little boys.

1:05:41.503 --> 1:05:44.461
Ha! It's my lucky day!

1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:47.961
Yodel me this!

1:06:16.670 --> 1:06:19.461
Now that's what I call a swan song.

1:06:24.878 --> 1:06:27.545
You're coming with me!

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:34.878
What the fuck are you supposed to be?

1:07:15.211 --> 1:07:16.795
Bonjour, gentlemen.

1:07:16.961 --> 1:07:20.711
It is my great honor to welcome you
to our National Day festivities.

1:07:20.878 --> 1:07:24.628
Bonjour, monsieur le president,
on behalf of myself and my colleagues,

1:07:24.795 --> 1:07:29.253
let me extend our sincere appreciation
for inviting us to this event.

1:07:32.503 --> 1:07:36.170
<i>Mon pleasure</i>. It is a great opportunity
to celebrate the dawn of a new era.

1:07:39.670 --> 1:07:41.753
But for now, relax, eat.

1:07:42.086 --> 1:07:44.170
We will discuss business later.

1:07:45.878 --> 1:07:47.836
Super. Splendid.
- Excellent.

1:07:51.711 --> 1:07:53.836
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:07:54.795 --> 1:07:57.086
<i>give it up to our...</i>

1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:00.586
Very Swiss Leader, President Meili!

1:08:04.711 --> 1:08:08.128
Happy Swiss National Day, dear citizens.

1:08:09.295 --> 1:08:15.253
Today we shall celebrate
20 years of Switzerland's new order!
