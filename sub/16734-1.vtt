02:45.581 --> 02:48.106
Hello, admitting.

02:48.150 --> 02:51.517
This is Saperstein.
Where is he?

02:53.589 --> 02:55.284
He's cleared admitting?

02:55.324 --> 02:58.657
Right. Bring him in.

03:08.437 --> 03:10.098
He's coming.

03:10.139 --> 03:11.868
Good, good.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.243
Trent?

03:22.284 --> 03:23.945
John J.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.181
Put him in number nine.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.158
You son of a bitch!

03:35.765 --> 03:37.289
Hang on to him.

03:47.610 --> 03:48.907
Get him in there!

03:48.944 --> 03:51.105
No, not me!

03:51.147 --> 03:53.081
No, wait, wait!

03:53.115 --> 03:54.446
This is wrong.

03:54.483 --> 03:57.646
Look, I'm sorry about the balls!

03:57.686 --> 04:00.154
It was a lucky shot, that's all!

04:00.189 --> 04:02.157
Wait!

04:15.271 --> 04:17.171
I'm not insane.

04:17.206 --> 04:18.399
You hear me?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.704
I'm not insane!

04:20.743 --> 04:23.041
I'm not if he's not!

04:24.914 --> 04:27.644
Me neither!

04:27.683 --> 04:33.280
I'm not insane!

05:16.732 --> 05:21.499
We've only just begun

05:21.537 --> 05:24.631
Not the Carpenters, too.

05:28.077 --> 05:31.535
So let me go

06:13.088 --> 06:16.956
This is a rotten way to end it.

06:16.992 --> 06:18.459
This is not the ending.

06:18.494 --> 06:19.961
You haven't read it yet.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.118
All right.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.558
Came in this afternoon?

06:51.594 --> 06:54.495
Yes. How did you
get here so fast?

06:54.530 --> 06:56.122
We've been monitoring
all admissions...

06:56.165 --> 06:57.530
through police
and paramedic channels.

06:57.566 --> 06:58.692
This one fit the symptoms.

06:58.734 --> 07:02.636
Do you think he's one of them?

07:02.671 --> 07:04.195
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you...

07:04.239 --> 07:05.934
that's what I'm here
to find out.

07:05.975 --> 07:08.500
Things must be getting
pretty bad out there...

07:08.544 --> 07:10.239
to bring you fellas in.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.474
Is this it?

07:14.750 --> 07:16.308
Did he make any requests?

07:16.352 --> 07:18.547
Just...

07:18.587 --> 07:19.884
one.

07:19.922 --> 07:21.082
A, uh...

07:21.123 --> 07:24.058
single black crayon.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.280
Hang on.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.216
What's up?

07:55.257 --> 07:58.317
My name is Dr. Wrenn...

07:58.360 --> 08:00.419
and I am going to try
and get you out of here.

08:02.631 --> 08:05.327
After all my redecorating?

08:05.367 --> 08:07.699
No. I think I'll stay.

08:07.736 --> 08:10.398
There's a guard with a pair
of swollen testicles...

08:10.439 --> 08:12.703
who swears you wanted
out of here.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.444
I, uh, well...

08:16.478 --> 08:18.708
I've changed my mind.

08:18.747 --> 08:21.079
I see.

08:21.116 --> 08:24.244
The crosses are a nice touch.

08:24.286 --> 08:27.312
They'd almost have
to keep you in here...

08:27.356 --> 08:30.985
once they'd seen these,
wouldn't they, John?

08:31.026 --> 08:32.618
Got a smoke?

08:47.309 --> 08:49.709
<i>You're waiting to hear
about my "them," aren't you?</i>

08:49.745 --> 08:51.110
Your what?

08:52.614 --> 08:54.309
<i>My "them. "</i>

08:55.417 --> 08:57.510
Every paranoid schizophrenic
has one...

08:57.553 --> 09:00.647
<i>a "them," a "they," an "it. "</i>

09:00.689 --> 09:04.386
<i>And you want to hear
about my "them," don't you?</i>

09:04.426 --> 09:06.417
I want to know how you got here.

09:10.232 --> 09:13.793
Things are turning to shit
out there, aren't they?

09:15.537 --> 09:17.630
Let's talk about you.

09:20.409 --> 09:22.138
Your dime.

09:23.946 --> 09:26.039
I'm, uh...

09:26.081 --> 09:30.609
I was an insurance investigator,
freelance.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.179
Checked out funny claims,
frauds...

09:34.223 --> 09:36.214
the usual kind of thing.

09:36.258 --> 09:40.319
And lately I'd been working
for a firm here in the city.

09:40.362 --> 09:47.234
And all of this started
with the disappearance.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.531
The Sutter Cane...

09:50.572 --> 09:52.130
disappearance.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.041
It's a little hot in here,
isn't it?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.414
It's boiling.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.882
How long I gotta be here?

10:05.921 --> 10:07.889
I mean, uh...

10:07.923 --> 10:10.221
I took care
of all that paperwork.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.284
The check was supposed
to be here three weeks ago.

10:12.327 --> 10:14.921
Right? Isn't that right?

10:14.963 --> 10:16.954
Well, usually, yeah,
that's the way it goes...

10:16.999 --> 10:20.594
but I just have a few final
questions about the fire.

10:20.636 --> 10:21.762
More questions.

10:21.804 --> 10:23.362
I've answered
all your questions.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.531
Enough's enough.

10:24.573 --> 10:27.371
It was supposed
to be cut and dried.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.309
We'll be out of here
in a minute.

10:29.344 --> 10:31.938
See, Robby here,
he owns the company.

10:31.980 --> 10:35.074
And he's hired me to see that
things go smoothly, understand?

10:35.117 --> 10:37.984
It's just a little thing,
but, see...

10:38.020 --> 10:39.988
Robby takes the view
that it was you...

10:40.022 --> 10:43.185
who burned down your own
warehouse on Northern Boulevard.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.090
Me? That's horseshit.

10:45.127 --> 10:46.560
That was all my own stuff
in that warehouse.

10:46.595 --> 10:47.721
That's my whole life.

10:47.763 --> 10:50.630
Believe me, I sympathize.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.395
You're really starting to sweat.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.561
Shall I turn on
the air conditioning?

10:54.603 --> 10:56.070
Oh, no, I'm fine.

10:56.104 --> 10:57.571
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:58.874 --> 11:01.001
I'm running a little late.

11:01.043 --> 11:03.204
Supposed to pick up my wife.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.475
Oh, yeah, your wife.

11:05.514 --> 11:07.311
She's a great lady.

11:08.517 --> 11:10.348
You know her?

11:10.385 --> 11:12.250
No, not really.
We just met briefly.

11:12.287 --> 11:16.451
You know, when I went round
to check up on your story.

11:16.491 --> 11:17.753
We have these photographs...

11:17.793 --> 11:21.752
of your wife
tooling around town...

11:21.797 --> 11:23.094
wearing various articles...

11:23.131 --> 11:26.066
that you claim
were destroyed in the fire.

11:26.101 --> 11:29.264
No, that's impossible.

11:31.773 --> 11:35.209
No, this is all stuff
I bought for her myself.

11:35.244 --> 11:36.905
See, the problem is...

11:36.945 --> 11:39.379
when I went round
to talk to her...

11:39.414 --> 11:42.679
it turned out she knew much more
than she thought she did.

11:42.718 --> 11:44.310
Especially...

11:44.353 --> 11:49.586
Especially after I showed her
pictures of Miss Palminteri...

11:49.625 --> 11:51.217
who appears to be wearing...

11:51.260 --> 11:53.091
even more
of your destroyed articles.

11:55.264 --> 11:57.255
Miss Palminteri?

11:58.667 --> 12:01.295
Miss Rosa Palminteri.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.472
A word of advice.

12:04.506 --> 12:09.637
You want to pull a scam,
don't make your wife a partner.

12:09.678 --> 12:11.737
If you do...

12:11.780 --> 12:14.806
don't fuck around
behind her back.

12:16.985 --> 12:18.976
Trent, beautiful.

12:19.021 --> 12:23.117
Everybody says you got the best
nose for a con in the business.

12:23.158 --> 12:26.218
But to see it firsthand, I mean,
to watch you work...

12:26.261 --> 12:27.592
is incredible.

12:27.629 --> 12:28.926
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.

12:28.964 --> 12:31.694
The guy's wife liked me.

12:31.733 --> 12:33.496
Besides, he was an amateur.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.968
It's too easy with amateurs.

12:35.003 --> 12:38.200
You try to figure out who's
professional and who isn't.

12:38.240 --> 12:42.176
That's when it gets fun,
when you run into a pro.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.804
You know, most of my salesmen...

12:44.846 --> 12:46.837
couldn't sniff out
a phony claim...

12:46.882 --> 12:49.350
if their noses
were nailed to it, but you...

12:49.384 --> 12:51.318
man, you never miss.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.581
What's to miss?

12:52.621 --> 12:55.089
You learn to expect the worst
in people, and you get it.

12:55.123 --> 12:58.149
Everyone's looking
to play an angle.

12:58.193 --> 13:00.855
I'm always there
to clean up the mess.

13:00.896 --> 13:02.158
I'll tell you what.

13:02.197 --> 13:05.098
You stop freelancing,
join my staff.

13:05.133 --> 13:06.998
I'll make it worth your while.

13:07.035 --> 13:09.060
Forget it, Robby.

13:09.104 --> 13:11.572
I'm my own man.
Nobody pulls my strings.

13:11.606 --> 13:12.937
I'm independent, I'm happy.

13:12.975 --> 13:15.535
Well, be my man one more time.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.410
I'm having quite
a difficult mess with Arcane.

13:18.447 --> 13:19.607
The publishing house?

13:19.648 --> 13:21.445
Yeah, my biggest account.

13:21.483 --> 13:25.681
They just filed a claim
that cost me millions.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.621
I want you on this right away.

13:27.656 --> 13:28.782
What's the claim?

13:28.824 --> 13:30.291
Sutter Cane is missing.

13:30.325 --> 13:31.587
Who?

13:31.626 --> 13:32.888
Sutter Cane.

13:53.015 --> 13:55.142
Do you read Sutter Cane?

13:55.183 --> 13:56.582
What?

14:18.073 --> 14:20.200
Horror writer Sutter Cane...

14:20.242 --> 14:23.211
a harmless pop phenomenon...

14:23.245 --> 14:26.180
or a deadly mad prophet
of the printed page?

14:26.214 --> 14:29.809
This was the scene today
outside several city bookstores.

14:29.851 --> 14:31.182
Police believe
the riots began...

14:31.219 --> 14:33.710
because the stores
could not meet the demand...

14:33.755 --> 14:37.282
for advance orders
of Sutter Cane's latest novel...

14:37.325 --> 14:39.088
"In the Mouth of Madness. "

14:39.127 --> 14:41.687
When does fiction
become religion?

14:41.730 --> 14:43.493
And are his fans dangerous?

14:43.532 --> 14:45.693
Only if you count axes.

14:45.734 --> 14:49.261
In related news, there were
eighteen other stores...

15:03.952 --> 15:05.817
Mr. Harglow will see you now.

15:05.854 --> 15:07.014
Thank you.

15:08.857 --> 15:10.984
You're not listening to me.
I needed it yesterday.

15:11.026 --> 15:13.119
If you wait any longer, it'll be
all over the front page.

15:13.161 --> 15:14.287
Get it done!

15:14.329 --> 15:18.390
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.695
It's a pleasure.

15:19.734 --> 15:20.860
Excuse the commotion.

15:20.902 --> 15:24.303
We have something
of a crisis going on.

15:24.339 --> 15:25.966
Everybody out now, please.

15:26.007 --> 15:27.872
I need time with Mr. Trent.

15:27.909 --> 15:30.241
Have Sylvia hold the calls,
and you get Linda in here.

15:30.278 --> 15:34.009
That was great.
I almost left myself.

15:34.049 --> 15:35.778
Sit down, please.

15:35.817 --> 15:38.945
I am a little short
on patience these days.

15:38.987 --> 15:43.617
So, Mr. Trent,
are you familiar with Arcane?

15:43.658 --> 15:44.818
Well, aside from the fact...

15:44.860 --> 15:46.953
that you're insured
by the company I work for...

15:46.995 --> 15:48.587
I never heard of Arcane.
I'm sorry.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.120
You read books?

15:54.336 --> 15:57.362
Linda Styles, John Trent.

15:57.405 --> 16:00.704
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.

16:00.742 --> 16:01.868
Since she joined the firm...

16:01.910 --> 16:04.708
she's been handling
Sutter Cane exclusively.

16:04.746 --> 16:08.375
Isn't he the guy
that writes that horror crap?

16:08.416 --> 16:10.247
Maybe he's too sophisticated
for you.

16:10.285 --> 16:11.684
Sutter Cane happens to be...

16:11.720 --> 16:13.984
this century's
most widely read author.

16:14.022 --> 16:15.956
You can forget
about Stephen King.

16:15.991 --> 16:17.822
Cane outsells them all.

16:17.859 --> 16:21.022
So what happened
to this cash cow of yours?

16:21.062 --> 16:23.929
Cane disappeared two months ago
without a trace.

16:23.965 --> 16:27.526
The police
have turned up nothing.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.299
Who was the last person
to hear from him?

16:30.338 --> 16:31.464
His agent.

16:31.506 --> 16:33.133
Cane mailed him
several chapters...

16:33.175 --> 16:35.336
of his new book,
oh, not two weeks ago.

16:35.377 --> 16:39.143
Plain brown wrapper.
No return address.

16:41.449 --> 16:45.180
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
You don't mind, do you?

16:51.426 --> 16:53.894
What'd the agent have to say?

16:53.929 --> 16:56.591
You heard what he had to say.

16:56.631 --> 16:58.599
What are you talking about?

16:58.633 --> 17:00.692
I understand you were there...

17:00.735 --> 17:04.102
when the poor man went crazy
in midtown Manhattan.

17:04.138 --> 17:06.539
You witnessed the shooting,
I believe.

17:06.575 --> 17:08.839
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?

17:10.145 --> 17:11.942
Hard to believe, isn't it?

17:11.980 --> 17:16.246
Yeah, well, you'd think a guy
that outsells Stephen King...

17:16.284 --> 17:17.979
could find
better representation.

17:20.121 --> 17:21.713
Excuse me.

17:34.436 --> 17:36.267
It's just a little joke.

17:36.304 --> 17:38.534
Well, we're not in the mood.

17:38.573 --> 17:40.040
I'll see you out, Mr. Trent.

17:40.075 --> 17:41.201
Thank you.

17:41.243 --> 17:43.074
Cane is a billion-dollar
franchise.

17:43.111 --> 17:44.738
He's the tent pole
to this company.

17:44.779 --> 17:47.213
We've already sold the film
rights to his new book...

17:47.249 --> 17:50.275
as well as publication rights
in eighteen languages...

17:50.318 --> 17:51.979
The book you can't find?

17:52.020 --> 17:54.750
Well, his agent found it,
at least part of it.

17:54.789 --> 17:57.383
You think he took one look
at this latest work of art...

17:57.425 --> 17:59.689
and went ax-happy
in broad daylight?

17:59.728 --> 18:00.786
I think it's great.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.263
It's great promotion for Arcane,
great publicity.

18:03.298 --> 18:05.266
This was not a publicity stunt.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.494
You were there.

18:06.534 --> 18:09.094
Cane's writing has been known
to have an effect...

18:09.137 --> 18:10.764
on his less stable readers.

18:10.805 --> 18:12.102
An effect? Like what?

18:12.140 --> 18:14.802
Well, disorientation,
memory loss...

18:14.843 --> 18:16.037
severe paranoid reaction.

18:16.077 --> 18:18.671
People pay money
to feel like that? It's cute.

18:18.713 --> 18:20.681
Put it in the press kit.

18:20.715 --> 18:23.013
We need you.

18:23.051 --> 18:26.646
OK. Well, why don't you and I
get together after work?

18:26.688 --> 18:28.485
We'll go through his files.

18:29.658 --> 18:30.955
I don't think so.

18:30.992 --> 18:33.927
I need to see his contracts,
papers, you know.

18:33.962 --> 18:36.328
Impossible.
His agent was a total buffer.

18:36.364 --> 18:39.197
We don't even know
where Cane lives.

18:39.234 --> 18:41.361
What do you know?

18:41.403 --> 18:43.098
For about a year
before he disappeared...

18:43.138 --> 18:46.972
his work became erratic,
bent, more bizarre than usual.

18:47.008 --> 18:49.943
He became convinced his writing
was real, not fiction.

18:49.978 --> 18:52.003
Then the work stopped coming.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.379
I need to know
if he's alive or dead.

18:54.416 --> 18:55.542
And I need that book.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.710
We've delayed publication
as long as we can.

18:57.752 --> 18:59.982
His fans are getting
really restless.

19:00.955 --> 19:02.786
This shit really sells,
doesn't it?

19:02.824 --> 19:04.883
More than you'd imagine.
Surprised?

19:05.994 --> 19:08.428
Lady, nothing surprises me.

19:08.463 --> 19:11.489
We fucked up the air, the water,
we fucked up each other.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.091
Why don't we finish the job...

19:13.134 --> 19:15.762
by just flushing our brains
down the toilet?

19:15.804 --> 19:18.602
Why don't you try
reading his stuff?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.574
See if you can get it.

19:20.608 --> 19:21.939
Got any on tape?

20:03.385 --> 20:04.977
You want some, too, buddy?

20:05.019 --> 20:06.543
No, relax, Robby.

20:06.588 --> 20:09.557
Look, it's a scam,
of course it's a scam.

20:09.591 --> 20:11.024
You see...

20:11.059 --> 20:13.289
all this strange behaviorfrom
people that read the books...

20:13.328 --> 20:15.922
and the agent
going nuts and so on...

20:15.964 --> 20:19.297
Ifigure it's like
mass hysteria, you know?

20:19.334 --> 20:22.235
It's like, um,
it's a pop phenomenon.

20:22.270 --> 20:23.760
It's a craze. It'll pass.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.536
It's this year's Hula-Hoop.
Something like that.

20:27.575 --> 20:31.033
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.

20:31.079 --> 20:33.070
No, it's a setup.

20:33.114 --> 20:35.480
I just have to work out
how it's set up.

20:35.517 --> 20:37.712
It's just a matter of time.

20:37.752 --> 20:38.946
You, too?

20:40.522 --> 20:42.683
God, I've had heartburn,
tell me about it.

20:42.724 --> 20:46.455
Sporadic riots continue
to hit Eastern cities...

20:46.494 --> 20:49.361
and reports of violence
from Boston and Philadelphia...

20:49.397 --> 20:51.194
are now coming in.

20:51.232 --> 20:54.929
Police continue to describe
barely coherent witnesses...

20:54.969 --> 20:56.197
all reporting having read...

20:56.237 --> 20:59.001
horror novelist
Sutter Cane's latest novel...

20:59.040 --> 21:00.837
<i>'Hobb's End Horror. "</i>

21:00.875 --> 21:03.105
Many officers have been
physically attacked...

21:03.144 --> 21:06.079
and more than
three hundred eighty people...

21:06.114 --> 21:09.311
male and female, have been
jailed in New York County.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.750
Two officers in Boston
were hacked to death...

21:11.786 --> 21:15.552
amid jeering crowds
in an attack last night.

21:17.392 --> 21:20.520
What is this horrible,
unexplainable madness...

21:20.562 --> 21:22.393
that is gripping our lives?

21:22.430 --> 21:24.057
What in the world is happening?

21:24.098 --> 21:25.531
I can see.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.865
Now we have an editorial...

21:27.902 --> 21:29.392
Excuse me?

21:29.437 --> 21:32.099
He sees you.

21:33.975 --> 21:35.306
Great. Uh...

21:36.811 --> 21:38.073
Tell him I say hi.

21:49.591 --> 21:52.492
Oh, hi, Robby. Yeah.
Yeah, not a lot.

21:52.527 --> 21:55.018
I picked up some of
these Sutter Cane books.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.496
I've been reading them.

21:56.531 --> 21:57.759
Well, it...

21:57.799 --> 22:00.029
Pulp horror novels.
They're all pretty familiar.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.933
They all seem
to have the same plot.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.801
Slimy things in the dark,
people go mad...

22:03.838 --> 22:05.271
they turn into monsters.

22:05.306 --> 22:08.275
The funny thing is that they're
kind of better written...

22:08.309 --> 22:09.674
than you'd expect.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.201
They sort of get to you
in a way.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.180
I don't know
if it's his style of writing...

22:13.214 --> 22:15.842
or his use of description
or whatever, but...

22:17.785 --> 22:19.514
No, don't be silly.

23:41.469 --> 23:43.733
Do you want some, too, buddy?

23:47.208 --> 23:49.335
He sees you.

23:55.450 --> 23:56.610
What?

24:18.606 --> 24:20.369
Aw, it's just too weird.

24:57.612 --> 24:59.546
Beautiful.

25:04.686 --> 25:06.119
Where'd you go?

25:09.924 --> 25:11.789
Assuming you went somewhere.

26:30.838 --> 26:32.635
Cute.

26:32.673 --> 26:36.473
Now I know why Cane
had the artwork done himself.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.309
See this?
It's a map.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.144
The red dot is Hobb's End.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.843
It's not on any real map,
but look at this.

26:42.884 --> 26:45.614
The two line up.

26:45.653 --> 26:46.950
Like it or not...

26:46.988 --> 26:49.548
Cane's book covers
place Hobb's End...

26:49.590 --> 26:51.285
right in the middle
of New England.

26:51.325 --> 26:53.953
So you're saying the man
went someplace fictional?

26:53.995 --> 26:57.055
It's a real place
in a real state.

26:57.098 --> 26:58.429
New Hampshire, to be precise.

26:58.466 --> 27:00.024
But it's not on the map.

27:00.067 --> 27:03.628
Well, not on any new ones,
but maybe on some old ones.

27:03.671 --> 27:07.471
There's plenty of forgotten
towns across America.

27:07.508 --> 27:09.476
Makes a great contest,
doesn't it?

27:09.510 --> 27:11.068
Put the pieces together,
find the town...

27:11.112 --> 27:13.239
win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.

27:13.281 --> 27:16.580
How can you be sure he's there?

27:17.885 --> 27:20.319
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.

27:20.354 --> 27:22.754
You sure you want me to go?

27:22.790 --> 27:24.917
I'm not suggesting
that you're lying...

27:24.959 --> 27:26.927
that you're about to file
a fraudulent claim...

27:26.961 --> 27:29.156
but forgive me if this sounds...

27:29.197 --> 27:31.688
a little bit
like bullshit to me.

27:31.732 --> 27:33.165
And if you're telling
the truth...

27:33.201 --> 27:34.725
if you really want
your author back...

27:34.769 --> 27:36.703
if you really want your book...

27:36.737 --> 27:38.898
then maybe it's in both
our best interests...

27:38.940 --> 27:40.931
if I go find him.

27:40.975 --> 27:44.069
We have nothing to hide,
Mr. Trent.

27:44.111 --> 27:46.773
I desire only ourfair share
if Cane is dead...

27:46.814 --> 27:49.339
or our property if he's alive.

27:49.383 --> 27:51.908
Since I assume you also
have nothing to hide...

27:51.953 --> 27:55.218
I'm sure you won't mind
if I send Miss Styles along...

27:55.256 --> 27:56.814
on your expedition.

28:00.394 --> 28:02.362
Well, it's your party.

28:05.967 --> 28:09.027
America, the

28:15.376 --> 28:17.571
Beautiful

28:20.581 --> 28:22.879
From sea to

28:25.019 --> 28:27.487
Shining

28:35.696 --> 28:37.891
Who is it? What?

28:37.932 --> 28:39.991
You're awake.

28:43.871 --> 28:46.101
Couldn't you just shake me,
you asshole?

28:46.140 --> 28:47.801
What did I do?

28:50.611 --> 28:52.238
We're lost.

28:52.280 --> 28:57.684
We are lost because there
is no such place as Hobb's End.

28:57.718 --> 28:58.946
Well, we'll see.

29:00.354 --> 29:02.652
Never, never, never...

29:02.690 --> 29:04.351
throw chips at a driver.

29:06.961 --> 29:09.054
God damn it. Shit.

29:09.096 --> 29:10.256
Asshole.

29:16.704 --> 29:18.934
Styles, can I ask you something?

29:18.973 --> 29:22.773
Do you really like working
on Cane's stuff?

29:22.810 --> 29:25.244
Do you really like
busting people?

29:25.279 --> 29:27.839
Yeah. I bust frauds,
I bust phonies...

29:27.882 --> 29:29.179
and, yeah, I love it.

29:29.216 --> 29:31.776
Have you ever busted
anyone you know?

29:31.819 --> 29:33.548
Yeah, sure I did.

29:33.587 --> 29:34.884
Didn't make any difference.

29:34.922 --> 29:37.914
You see, in my business,
you soon find out...

29:37.959 --> 29:39.950
that anybody's
capable of anything.

29:39.994 --> 29:42.656
If you can think of it,
they've done it.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.665
Doesn't leave you much
to believe in.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.189
Yeah.
But think of the upside...

29:46.233 --> 29:48.724
it doesn't leave you much
to be disappointed in, either.

29:48.769 --> 29:51.966
Believe me, the sooner we're off
the planet, the better.

29:52.006 --> 29:54.839
Now you sound like Cane.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.740
No, not me.

29:56.777 --> 29:59.075
You're the Cane lover.

29:59.113 --> 30:01.308
I just like being scared.

30:01.349 --> 30:03.010
Cane's work scares me.

30:03.050 --> 30:04.347
What's to be scared about?

30:04.385 --> 30:06.250
It's not like it's real
or anything.

30:06.287 --> 30:07.777
It's not real
from your point of view...

30:07.822 --> 30:09.881
and right now reality
shares your point of view.

30:09.924 --> 30:12.256
What scares me
about Cane's work...

30:12.293 --> 30:14.693
is what might happen if reality
shared his point of view.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.129
Whoa. We're not talking
about reality here.

30:17.164 --> 30:19.496
We're talking about fiction.
It's different, you know.

30:19.533 --> 30:22.934
A reality is just what
we tell each other it is.

30:22.970 --> 30:25.404
Sane and insane could
easily switch places...

30:25.439 --> 30:27.999
if the insane were
to become the majority.

30:28.042 --> 30:30.943
You would find yourself
locked in a padded cell...

30:30.978 --> 30:34.744
wondering what happened
to the world.

30:34.782 --> 30:37.046
No, that wouldn't happen to me.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.052
It would if you realized...

30:39.086 --> 30:42.021
everything you ever knew
was gone.

30:42.056 --> 30:46.152
It'd be pretty lonely
being the last one left.

30:50.831 --> 30:52.423
Not only in Manhattan proper...

30:52.466 --> 30:55.026
but there was that incident
in Long Island...

30:55.069 --> 30:56.331
that was also related to it.

30:56.370 --> 30:59.567
Come on, I don't buy this.
I mean, what are you saying?

30:59.607 --> 31:00.699
That there's some kind
of disease...

31:00.741 --> 31:02.106
that's spreading
across the country?

31:02.143 --> 31:05.044
It is an addiction
that people have at this time...

31:05.079 --> 31:08.344
fantasy-creating
out of the written material.

31:08.382 --> 31:10.316
How could it be addicting?

31:10.351 --> 31:12.581
Look, I mean this is words.

31:23.998 --> 31:26.831
Or just something
that is created by the press?

31:26.867 --> 31:30.564
No. I think it's acting stupid
is what it is.

31:58.666 --> 31:59.826
Jesus Christ.

32:01.135 --> 32:03.228
I saw a...

32:03.270 --> 32:06.330
A cow, a sheep, a pig?
What'd you see?

32:06.373 --> 32:08.898
Never mind.
It was nothing.

32:08.943 --> 32:10.103
Good.

32:39.773 --> 32:41.138
Don't move him!

32:41.175 --> 32:42.301
Is he alive?

32:42.343 --> 32:43.776
I don't know.

32:43.811 --> 32:45.244
Just don't move.

32:45.279 --> 32:46.940
He'll get a blanket,
so lie still.

32:46.981 --> 32:48.573
I can't get out.

32:48.616 --> 32:49.742
Don't move.

32:49.783 --> 32:52.308
They won't let me out.

33:17.244 --> 33:18.609
He was OK?

33:23.884 --> 33:26.409
Come on, let's go.

33:26.453 --> 33:29.889
We'll tell the cops
when we hit the next town.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.118
You OK?

35:10.658 --> 35:12.319
Oh, I can't believe it.

35:12.359 --> 35:15.294
I must have slept
through the whole night.

35:15.329 --> 35:16.956
Hey, thanks for driving.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.199
What is it?

35:21.235 --> 35:22.497
Look.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.068
Styles, you're fantastic.
You found it.

35:31.011 --> 35:32.171
What's wrong?

35:34.048 --> 35:35.310
You drive.

36:22.629 --> 36:24.256
Cute, cute, cute.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.096
Main Street, USA.

36:32.406 --> 36:33.566
Jesus.

36:44.351 --> 36:45.545
Antiques.

36:51.325 --> 36:52.986
Look at this old crap.

36:53.026 --> 36:55.586
I wonder where they
manufacture this shit.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.578
Look.

37:12.613 --> 37:15.446
Those kids.

37:15.482 --> 37:16.972
You didn't see them?

37:19.553 --> 37:20.850
Where is everyone?

37:20.888 --> 37:22.515
It's like the place
is picture perfect...

37:22.556 --> 37:24.319
and there's nobody around.

37:24.358 --> 37:26.155
Come on.

38:04.631 --> 38:06.394
Styles, how'd you know
about this place?

38:06.433 --> 38:09.197
I thought you'd never
been here before.

38:09.236 --> 38:11.602
I haven't.
I've read about it.

38:11.638 --> 38:12.798
So have you.

38:14.775 --> 38:16.606
This is empty now.

38:16.643 --> 38:19.612
It used to be filled
with strange growing things...

38:19.646 --> 38:20.806
remember?

38:20.848 --> 38:23.681
One night, the townspeople
saw something moving in here...

38:23.717 --> 38:27.483
something enormous,
with arms like snakes.

38:28.522 --> 38:31.389
<i>'Hobb's End Horror. "</i>

38:31.425 --> 38:34.019
The hotelfrom...

38:34.061 --> 38:36.154
<i>'Hobb's End Horror. "</i>

38:36.196 --> 38:38.596
Styles,
you know what I'm thinking?

38:38.632 --> 38:41.260
There's gotta be a great
tie-in for a town like this.

38:41.301 --> 38:44.600
I mean, think of the tourist
potential, for instance, or...

38:44.638 --> 38:47.664
There should be
a painting behind us.

38:49.576 --> 38:51.669
It's nice.

38:51.712 --> 38:53.612
There's a loose board there.

39:01.622 --> 39:02.816
Good morning.

39:04.024 --> 39:05.651
Can I help you folks?

39:05.692 --> 39:06.818
I certainly hope so.

39:06.860 --> 39:08.384
We'd like a room, please.

39:08.428 --> 39:10.259
We're on our way to Boston.

39:10.297 --> 39:11.764
We thought we'd take a...

39:11.798 --> 39:14.096
break in yourfamous
little town.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.567
Famous?

39:15.602 --> 39:18.537
Yeah, what with the whole
Sutter Cane thing and all.

39:18.572 --> 39:20.540
Sut-Sutter who?

39:20.574 --> 39:24.101
Cane. We heard he came
from around here...

39:24.144 --> 39:25.839
and comes back to stay
once in a while.

39:25.879 --> 39:29.975
Uh, I don't know anybody
named Cane.

39:31.451 --> 39:35.683
Ha. Nobody passes
through here much anymore.

39:35.722 --> 39:37.417
Let me get you your keys.

39:37.457 --> 39:40.392
You want me to leave a deposit
or my credit card or something?

39:41.995 --> 39:43.860
Oh, city folk.

39:50.070 --> 39:53.039
Miss Styles,
if that's what you saw, then...

39:53.073 --> 39:56.008
yeah, I guess it would
be a little... unsettling.

39:56.043 --> 39:57.874
I'd be a little unnerved myself.

39:57.911 --> 40:02.007
But regardless of what you saw,
regardless of what you think...

40:02.049 --> 40:05.314
we are not living inside
a Sutter Cane story.

40:06.687 --> 40:08.518
They're all in here.

40:10.557 --> 40:12.422
The Mrs. Pickman
in the book is a lunatic...

40:12.459 --> 40:15.792
who chops her husband
into coleslaw.

40:15.829 --> 40:18.992
That sweet old thing
that we met downstairs...

40:19.032 --> 40:21.626
isn't capable
of anything worse than...

40:22.803 --> 40:25.567
dipping her dentures
into her husband's beer.

40:25.606 --> 40:28.040
Trent, I know
you think this is a joke.

40:28.075 --> 40:30.475
Just listen to me
for a second, please.

40:30.510 --> 40:33.138
What if Cane's work
isn't fiction?

40:33.180 --> 40:35.546
Oh, for Christ's sake.

40:37.117 --> 40:39.017
This is reality.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.578
You hear that?

40:41.622 --> 40:43.180
Reality.

40:43.223 --> 40:45.714
Now, if what you're saying
is true...

40:45.759 --> 40:48.159
there should be
out that window...

40:48.195 --> 40:51.756
a black Byzantine church with
two-hundred-fifty-foot spires...

40:51.798 --> 40:53.823
with gold onions on the top.

40:53.867 --> 40:55.027
Now, look.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.670
You see?
Reality.

40:58.705 --> 41:01.606
You didn't read closely enough.

41:02.676 --> 41:05.167
The view is from the east.

41:13.754 --> 41:15.984
"This place had once been
the seat of an evil...

41:16.023 --> 41:17.615
"older than mankind...

41:17.658 --> 41:19.956
"and wider
than the known universe.

41:19.993 --> 41:21.483
"It was a place
of pain and suffering...

41:21.528 --> 41:23.723
"beyond human understanding. "

41:23.764 --> 41:27.131
You got me reading this thing
like it's a guidebook.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.226
"Originally,
there was an old stone church...

41:29.269 --> 41:31.931
"built on this site
in seventeen eighty-eight...

41:31.972 --> 41:33.269
"but the black church...

41:33.306 --> 41:35.433
"swallowed up
the old sanctuary...

41:35.475 --> 41:37.568
"the way it has swallowed
our minds.

41:37.611 --> 41:41.047
"Now there is nothing left
of what was once here...

41:41.081 --> 41:43.845
"except the mosaic
of our Lord and Savior...

41:43.884 --> 41:46.318
"above the front door. "

41:50.857 --> 41:53.587
"Some believe the old sanctuary
still exists somewhere...

41:53.627 --> 41:56.221
"trapped inside
this evil edifice.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.821
"It's primeval inhabitants...

41:57.864 --> 41:59.889
"were a murderous race
of creatures...

41:59.933 --> 42:02.993
"whose vile existence
contaminated time itself...

42:03.036 --> 42:04.731
"affecting history...

42:04.771 --> 42:06.966
"with their sadistic wickedness. "

42:25.759 --> 42:27.727
It's the battle for heaven.

42:27.761 --> 42:29.353
The archangel Michael's
fighting off...

42:29.396 --> 42:31.728
Don't tell me. "Fighting off
one of the creatures...

42:31.765 --> 42:33.198
"from the other side," right?

42:33.233 --> 42:35.724
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.

42:35.769 --> 42:36.895
"Beyond description. "

42:36.937 --> 42:39.132
Right.
We're wasting our time.

42:39.172 --> 42:41.037
We ought to be asking
about Cane.

42:42.275 --> 42:44.800
We'll have somebody to ask
in about two seconds.

42:48.148 --> 42:51.015
Come on,
we have to get out of here.

42:51.051 --> 42:53.212
We can't be in front
of the church, Trent.

42:53.253 --> 42:54.686
They have guns, Trent.

43:12.072 --> 43:13.972
No, I want to go back.

43:14.007 --> 43:17.340
Give him back!

43:24.217 --> 43:25.650
Johnny!

43:25.685 --> 43:27.448
Johnny-boy!

43:46.973 --> 43:48.338
Is that Cane?

44:20.841 --> 44:22.775
Get in the truck!

44:25.011 --> 44:27.605
Where are they comingfrom?

44:47.834 --> 44:49.802
I see.

44:52.405 --> 44:55.431
Tell me how you knew
about that mob!

44:56.710 --> 44:58.871
You see, you can't bullshit
a bullshitter, can you?

44:58.912 --> 45:00.038
'Cause I'll tell you how.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.275
This whole thing
has been staged, that's how.

45:02.315 --> 45:04.408
You, Harglow, and Cane
put me through all of this...

45:04.451 --> 45:05.850
so I can blab to the media...

45:05.886 --> 45:07.786
about Cane's
haunted little town...

45:07.821 --> 45:09.448
help you sell
a few more million copies.

45:09.489 --> 45:10.683
Well, fuck that.

45:10.724 --> 45:12.749
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

45:12.792 --> 45:14.123
Before I leave
this shitty town...

45:14.160 --> 45:15.991
I'm going to find someone
who's going to come clean...

45:16.029 --> 45:18.259
and we're going to dismiss
your bullshit claim.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.698
You're wrong, Trent.
I know you are wrong.

45:20.734 --> 45:21.860
How am I wrong?

45:21.902 --> 45:24.370
Because you're right.
You're half right.

45:24.404 --> 45:25.701
This was a hoax.

45:25.739 --> 45:27.969
We did send Cane away
on a publicity stunt...

45:28.008 --> 45:29.566
only he never showed up.

45:29.609 --> 45:32.442
Harglow sent me with you
to make it look good...

45:32.479 --> 45:35.380
only we weren't supposed to find
anything, but we did.

45:35.415 --> 45:38.282
That's how I know
what we're seeing is real.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.582
We didn't stage any of this.

45:40.620 --> 45:42.645
It's all happening
for real, Trent.

45:42.689 --> 45:45.385
And it is all in that book,
and that's how I know.

45:45.425 --> 45:46.551
You're lying.

45:46.593 --> 45:48.117
I read the books, too,
you remember?

45:48.161 --> 45:50.425
There's nothing about any mob,
any little girl.

45:50.463 --> 45:53.591
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one!

45:53.633 --> 45:58.570
No one knew what was in it
except me and Cane's agent.

46:04.110 --> 46:06.044
All right.

46:06.079 --> 46:08.104
What's it about, the new one?

46:08.148 --> 46:11.743
It's about the end
to everything...

46:11.785 --> 46:13.946
and it starts here
in this place...

46:13.987 --> 46:16.956
with an evil that returns
and takes over Hobb's End...

46:16.990 --> 46:20.448
piece by piece,
starting with the children.

46:20.493 --> 46:23.428
It's about people
turning into things...

46:23.463 --> 46:25.431
creatures that aren't
human anymore.

46:25.465 --> 46:27.660
It's fiction, Styles, fiction.

46:27.701 --> 46:32.331
We need to read the new book
to find the way out.

46:32.372 --> 46:33.896
How's that gonna help?

46:33.940 --> 46:36.704
We could skip to the ending.

46:36.743 --> 46:39.075
I really hope
you're making this up...

46:39.112 --> 46:42.047
because if you're not,
you're actually crazy.

46:42.082 --> 46:43.640
Please, Trent.

46:45.652 --> 46:48.416
Don't make me do this alone,
Trent.

46:53.493 --> 46:56.121
Are you coming with me?

46:58.198 --> 46:59.358
Fine.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.425
Have a nice bus ride home.

47:34.934 --> 47:36.993
No smoking, please.

47:37.037 --> 47:40.234
It bothers my husband.

47:40.273 --> 47:41.433
I'm sorry.

47:41.474 --> 47:44.204
I just can't seem to
help myself around here.

47:44.244 --> 47:46.007
I was just on my way out.

47:46.046 --> 47:48.674
I thought I'd stop
and admire the artwork.

47:48.715 --> 47:50.273
It's beautiful, isn't it?

47:50.316 --> 47:52.341
Sure is.

47:52.385 --> 47:55.377
Styles told me
you painted it yourself.

47:58.324 --> 48:03.318
You mean the pretty young thing
you came in here with?

48:05.231 --> 48:07.028
I don't know her at all.

48:07.067 --> 48:09.433
Does she know me?

48:09.469 --> 48:11.096
She claims she does.

48:12.138 --> 48:14.106
So you're not responsible
for this?

48:14.140 --> 48:16.267
Hell, no.

48:16.309 --> 48:19.870
Well, it's a nice place
you got here.

48:19.913 --> 48:23.576
It must be a hell
of a thing to keep clean.

48:23.616 --> 48:26.050
You look as if you've
been up all night.

48:27.387 --> 48:28.581
Been reading.

48:58.318 --> 49:00.309
Hush!

49:28.148 --> 49:29.809
You're a writer?

49:33.520 --> 49:34.782
You an actor?

49:34.821 --> 49:37.153
Take a hint, leave.

49:37.190 --> 49:38.953
This ain't no tourist town.

49:38.992 --> 49:42.086
Oh, I've been trying to.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.827
You guys are good, you know.

49:45.865 --> 49:48.129
You,
the old lady at the hotel...

49:48.168 --> 49:49.863
Really, really good.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.633
Cane's been messing
with the church.

49:52.672 --> 49:55.573
Now something came leaking out,
took the little ones first...

49:55.608 --> 49:57.269
then passed it on to us.

49:58.711 --> 50:00.679
Can I buy you a beer?

50:00.713 --> 50:03.978
Don't let it get to you.
Just get out.

50:18.064 --> 50:19.656
Give it.

50:19.699 --> 50:21.792
What are you?
Where do you come from?

50:23.236 --> 50:24.999
Where do you live?

50:25.038 --> 50:26.562
With you.

50:26.606 --> 50:28.130
Who takes care of you?

50:28.174 --> 50:29.300
You do.

50:29.342 --> 50:31.435
You're my mommy.

50:31.477 --> 50:33.638
Know what today is?

50:33.680 --> 50:36.547
Today is Mommy's Day.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.625
Nice to see you again.

53:13.406 --> 53:18.867
You can edit this one
from the inside, looking out.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.549
It's funny, isn't it?

53:24.584 --> 53:27.985
For years, I thought
I was making all this up.

53:32.091 --> 53:34.787
But they were telling me
what to write...

53:45.471 --> 53:48.531
giving me the power
to make it all real.

53:50.910 --> 53:52.241
And now it is.

54:02.455 --> 54:05.481
All those horrible,
slimy things...

54:05.525 --> 54:08.722
trying to get back in?

54:08.761 --> 54:10.661
They're all true.

54:25.611 --> 54:26.873
Come.

54:28.314 --> 54:30.874
See the instrument
of their homecoming.

54:32.151 --> 54:34.142
What you have come lookingfor.

54:35.421 --> 54:36.945
The new Bible...

54:40.326 --> 54:42.920
that starts the change...

54:44.564 --> 54:47.431
helps you see.

55:04.584 --> 55:06.279
Do you like my ending?

55:11.691 --> 55:13.454
Any suggestions?

55:51.430 --> 55:52.658
You found something.

55:52.698 --> 55:54.632
Where the hell did you go?

55:54.667 --> 55:56.134
I'm losing me, John.

55:56.168 --> 55:57.999
Help me.
I'm losing me.

56:00.239 --> 56:01.467
What's happening?

56:01.507 --> 56:02.940
I saw the book.

56:02.975 --> 56:05.773
Don't look at it.
Don't read it, John.

56:05.811 --> 56:08.746
I'm losing me!

56:23.896 --> 56:25.261
Mrs. Pickman!

56:53.926 --> 56:56.622
Come on, you old bitch.

58:09.001 --> 58:11.265
We're going. Now.

59:11.931 --> 59:14.525
You are a dead girl

59:20.706 --> 59:22.936
Fuck you!

59:31.417 --> 59:34.147
You're still here.

59:34.186 --> 59:36.654
Busy night.

59:36.689 --> 59:39.681
Special effects,
hidden speakers.

59:39.725 --> 59:42.387
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.

59:42.428 --> 59:46.228
The thing I can't remember
is what came first...

59:46.265 --> 59:47.892
us or the book.

59:49.435 --> 59:51.903
We are not living
in a Sutter Cane story!

59:51.937 --> 59:53.734
This is not reality!

59:55.074 --> 59:57.736
Reality is not
what it used to be.

59:57.777 --> 01:00:01.679
Oh, Jesus, this place
makes my head hurt.

01:00:01.714 --> 01:00:03.181
Oh, really?

01:00:03.215 --> 01:00:06.582
Come on, look at this.

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:09.850
This was done
by a five-year-old...

01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.447
my five-year-old.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:13.082
Johnny's sister.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:15.855
She did me
after she did her mom.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.630
You're alone.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.336
Shit. Don't.

01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:30.035
I have to.
He wrote me this way.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:04.642
Oh, shit.
The key.

01:01:10.816 --> 01:01:12.681
Jesus!

01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:24.423
Christ.

01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:28.893
Shit.

01:01:55.261 --> 01:01:58.458
Never leave the city.
Why don't I learn?

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.092
Are we leaving?

01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:04.229
We're already home.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:06.261
You should have believed me.

01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:09.534
Where's the fucking highway?

01:02:09.575 --> 01:02:12.203
Cane's writing me.
He wants me to kiss you.

01:02:12.244 --> 01:02:13.802
Why?

01:02:13.846 --> 01:02:15.404
Because it's good for the book.

01:02:15.447 --> 01:02:16.573
Jesus!

01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:17.877
It's what the readers
want to read.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:19.077
Oh, God!

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:27.687
Go! Get... get away from me!

01:02:53.652 --> 01:02:56.280
Cane has a job for you.

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:04.378
Afew bad calls.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:06.186
Afew wrong turns.

01:06:47.186 --> 01:06:51.179
Do you want to know the problem
with places like this?

01:06:51.223 --> 01:06:53.248
With religion in general?

01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:58.355
It's never known how to convey
the anatomy of horror.

01:06:58.397 --> 01:07:01.298
Religion seeks discipline
through fear...

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:04.461
yet doesn't understand
the true nature of creation.

01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:09.771
No one's ever believed it enough
to make it real.

01:07:11.043 --> 01:07:13.671
The same cannot be said
of my world.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.713
Your books aren't real.

01:07:17.749 --> 01:07:20.616
But they've sold
over a billion copies.

01:07:20.652 --> 01:07:24.247
I've been translated
into eighteen languages.

01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:28.055
More people believe in my work
than believe in the Bible.

01:07:32.064 --> 01:07:33.554
You got a point?

01:07:40.305 --> 01:07:42.000
I think you know it.

01:07:43.242 --> 01:07:45.403
There has to be
some kind of an explanation...

01:07:45.444 --> 01:07:47.105
for what I've seen tonight.

01:07:47.145 --> 01:07:50.137
I'll sort this shit out later,
but right now...

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:53.583
there has to be some kind of
a simple fucking explanation.

01:07:53.619 --> 01:07:57.350
Always lookingfor the con.

01:07:57.389 --> 01:08:00.825
Even now you're trying
to rationalize.

01:08:03.495 --> 01:08:05.793
Anyway...

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.662
your books suck.

01:08:13.639 --> 01:08:16.904
You must try
reading my new one.

01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:19.843
The others
have had quite an effect...

01:08:19.877 --> 01:08:23.143
but this one will drive you
absolutely mad.

01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:28.478
So I'm told.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.319
It'll make the world ready
for the change.

01:08:32.357 --> 01:08:33.654
It takes its power...

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:36.354
from new readers
and new believers.

01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:39.386
That's the point.
Belief!

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:43.094
When people begin to
lose their ability...

01:08:43.135 --> 01:08:47.401
to know the difference
between fantasy and reality...

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:53.173
the old ones can begin
their journey back.

01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:56.408
The more people who believe,
the faster the journey.

01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:01.243
And with the way
the other books have sold...

01:09:01.286 --> 01:09:05.245
this one is bound
to be very, very popular.

01:09:08.426 --> 01:09:10.189
Want to see?

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:24.635
All done.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:34.018
"In the Mouth of Madness. "

01:09:41.059 --> 01:09:42.924
Yours to deliver, Trent.

01:09:44.261 --> 01:09:45.490
What?

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:48.260
I will be joining
my new publishers now.

01:09:53.138 --> 01:09:56.403
You take the manuscript
back to the world for me...

01:09:56.441 --> 01:09:57.635
that's what you do.

01:09:57.676 --> 01:10:00.076
What I do?

01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:05.740
You are what I write.

01:10:07.352 --> 01:10:09.946
Like this town.

01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:11.717
It wasn't here
before I wrote it.

01:10:11.757 --> 01:10:14.282
And neither were you.

01:10:18.263 --> 01:10:20.163
I know what's real.

01:10:20.198 --> 01:10:22.462
I know what I am...

01:10:22.501 --> 01:10:24.230
and nobody pulls my strings.

01:10:26.338 --> 01:10:29.830
Did you think my agent
attacked you by accident?

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:33.567
He read about you...
in there.

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:37.571
He knew you'd bring it back
and start the change...

01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:39.811
make what's happened here
happen everywhere.

01:10:39.851 --> 01:10:41.876
He tried to stop you.

01:10:43.688 --> 01:10:45.679
I'm not a piece of fiction.

01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:48.955
I think, therefore you are.

01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:53.995
Read it if you don't
believe me.

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.131
See what I have
in store for you.

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:01.933
I know what I am.

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:12.576
Go back.

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:17.516
Your world lies
beyond that passage.

01:11:28.567 --> 01:11:30.467
Go now.

01:11:30.502 --> 01:11:33.835
I can't hold them back
any longer.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:29.287
"Trent stood
at the edge of the rip...

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:33.855
"stared into the illimitable
gulf of the unknown...

01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:38.700
"the Stygian world
yawning blackly beyond.

01:12:38.737 --> 01:12:41.604
"Trent's eyes refused to close.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.631
"He did not shriek...

01:12:43.675 --> 01:12:47.133
"but the hideous
unholy abominations...

01:12:47.178 --> 01:12:49.237
"shrieked for him...

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:51.772
"as in the same second
he saw them...

01:12:51.816 --> 01:12:54.148
"spill and tumble upward...

01:12:54.185 --> 01:12:58.212
"out of an enormous
carrion black pit...

01:12:58.256 --> 01:13:01.350
"choked with
the gleaming white bones...

01:13:01.393 --> 01:13:04.920
"of countless
unhallowed centuries.

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:06.794
"He began to back away
from the rip...

01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:09.732
"as the army
of unspeakable figures...

01:13:09.768 --> 01:13:12.566
"twilit by the glow
from the bottomless pit...

01:13:12.604 --> 01:13:15.471
"came pouring at him
toward our world. "

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:20.338
Come with me.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.638
I can't.

01:13:23.682 --> 01:13:26.378
I've read to the end.

01:14:42.627 --> 01:14:45.653
Hey, kid.

01:14:49.567 --> 01:14:51.091
You want a paper?

01:14:58.476 --> 01:15:01.343
Have you been in an accident?

01:15:04.582 --> 01:15:06.573
You want me to get somebody?

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.087
No. Just...

01:15:11.756 --> 01:15:14.452
Just point me to the highway.

01:15:14.492 --> 01:15:17.689
Straight up.

01:15:22.133 --> 01:15:23.293
Hey, kid.

01:15:27.872 --> 01:15:30.204
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?

01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:05.495
What?

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:08.165
Package for you, sir.

01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:10.538
But nobody knows I'm here.

01:17:10.575 --> 01:17:12.839
Well, someone does.

01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:41.929
Who delivered this?

01:17:41.973 --> 01:17:43.270
I don't know.

01:17:43.308 --> 01:17:44.434
Who?!

01:17:44.475 --> 01:17:45.942
I don't know!
I wasn't here last night.

01:17:45.977 --> 01:17:47.103
Who was it?!

01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:49.773
I was.
And I didn't see shit.

01:18:09.367 --> 01:18:13.269
I remember New York
during the Depression.

01:18:13.304 --> 01:18:16.501
They think they have it bad now.

01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:20.068
You should have seen
the Bowery back then.

01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:24.673
Bodies piled two, three feet
high off the gutter.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.603
I'm not going anywhere.

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:49.129
I'm God now.
You understand?

01:18:49.173 --> 01:18:51.641
God's not supposed to be
a hack horror writer.

01:18:51.676 --> 01:18:55.373
But maybe
I can help you believe.

01:18:55.413 --> 01:18:57.244
Look around when you wake up.

01:18:57.282 --> 01:19:02.083
Did I ever tell you
my favorite color was blue?

01:19:22.707 --> 01:19:24.004
Relax, buddy.

01:19:24.042 --> 01:19:26.101
Relax.
You're awake now.

01:19:26.144 --> 01:19:29.204
It was just a bad dream.

01:19:30.949 --> 01:19:33.417
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?

01:19:35.219 --> 01:19:38.211
I was just there in the town...

01:19:38.256 --> 01:19:40.315
in that town, and...

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:41.825
there were people there...

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:43.486
and shops and homes and...

01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:45.359
I don't doubt that.

01:19:45.396 --> 01:19:47.956
What I'm telling you
for the tenth time...

01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:50.331
is that it couldn't
have been called Hobb's End.

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:53.860
There never was, is,
or shall be any such place...

01:19:53.905 --> 01:19:55.634
by that name in this state.

01:19:55.673 --> 01:19:56.867
Ever.

01:19:56.908 --> 01:19:59.274
I want to see your supervisor!

01:20:44.389 --> 01:20:46.516
Well...

01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:48.752
that is quite a story.

01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:50.954
If you could write it,
I'd publish it.

01:20:52.964 --> 01:20:54.864
You don't believe it, do you?

01:20:57.735 --> 01:20:59.362
If I don't, what's my option?

01:20:59.404 --> 01:21:02.703
That I'm crazy?

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.435
I'm not crazy.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:07.307
Have you heard the rumors...

01:21:07.345 --> 01:21:12.305
that Cane's books
have affected certain readers?

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.716
Yeah. Styles told me.

01:21:14.752 --> 01:21:19.189
Styles... Oh, that's the girl
you say I sent with you.

01:21:19.223 --> 01:21:22.488
But I know I sent you off alone.

01:21:22.527 --> 01:21:26.088
Why wouldn't I remember her?

01:21:30.835 --> 01:21:33.167
Well...

01:21:33.204 --> 01:21:36.105
That's easy.
She was written out.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.767
Written out?

01:21:37.809 --> 01:21:40.937
Look, do you think...

01:21:40.978 --> 01:21:44.004
those books
somehow infected you?

01:21:44.048 --> 01:21:46.209
Listen to me, Harglow.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:49.913
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.

01:21:49.954 --> 01:21:53.048
And that's why I had to destroy
the last manuscript.

01:21:53.091 --> 01:21:56.117
But I know that's not true.

01:21:57.962 --> 01:21:59.361
What are you talking about?

01:21:59.397 --> 01:22:02.491
You delivered that manuscript
to me months ago.

01:22:02.533 --> 01:22:05.969
To me personally in this room.

01:22:06.003 --> 01:22:07.129
I did?

01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:10.368
Yes, you did.
Last spring.

01:22:10.408 --> 01:22:13.377
For God's sakes,
we published in July.

01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:15.140
The book's been in the stores
for seven weeks.

01:22:17.648 --> 01:22:18.774
Have you read it?

01:22:18.816 --> 01:22:21.478
No.
I never read Cane's work.

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:23.214
I haven't got
the stomach for it.

01:22:23.254 --> 01:22:26.246
Pull it.
Don't distribute it.

01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:29.384
Even if everything I've said
is totally Looney Tunes...

01:22:29.427 --> 01:22:32.191
I know this book
will drive people crazy.

01:22:32.230 --> 01:22:35.393
Well, let's hope so.

01:22:35.433 --> 01:22:37.663
The movie comes out next month.

01:22:39.003 --> 01:22:41.369
Oh, Christ.

01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:51.906
The newest, and presumably
posthumous, work...

01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:55.407
of Sutter Cane continues
to sit at number one...

01:22:55.453 --> 01:22:57.045
on the best-seller list.

01:22:57.088 --> 01:22:59.181
<i>'In the Mouth of Madness"
is expected to break...</i>

01:22:59.223 --> 01:23:01.987
all previous publishing records.

01:23:02.026 --> 01:23:04.654
On the local scene, police
are at a loss to explain...

01:23:04.695 --> 01:23:08.222
the outbreak of violent crime
among the city's clergy.

01:23:08.266 --> 01:23:10.325
The mayor has called
an emergency meeting...

01:23:10.368 --> 01:23:12.632
of law enforcement
and medical agencies...

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:16.697
to discuss an apparent epidemic
of paranoid schizophrenia.

01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:19.209
Just an unbelievably
horrible story, Bob.

01:23:19.243 --> 01:23:20.710
What began locally...

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:23.111
has now broken out
into a global epidemic.

01:23:23.147 --> 01:23:25.707
An epidemic
of monumental proportions...

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:29.686
of senseless, seemingly
unmotivated acts of violence.

01:23:31.055 --> 01:23:32.181
Like the book?

01:23:32.223 --> 01:23:33.747
I love it.

01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:36.692
Good.

01:23:36.727 --> 01:23:38.922
Then this shouldn't
come as a surprise.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:47.134
Jeez!
I don't believe he did that!

01:23:55.513 --> 01:23:57.344
It's spreading out there,
isn't it?

01:23:59.984 --> 01:24:01.884
Just because you know
the symptoms...

01:24:01.919 --> 01:24:04.080
doesn't mean to say
your story's true.

01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:07.056
It's Cane's story...

01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:09.082
and it'll spread
with each new reader.

01:24:09.126 --> 01:24:12.994
That's how it gets its power.

01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:17.057
What about the people
who don't read?

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:21.761
There's a movie.

01:24:23.274 --> 01:24:24.901
Oh, yes, of course.

01:24:31.949 --> 01:24:33.473
I'm gonna leave now...

01:24:33.517 --> 01:24:36.645
but I'll be coming back,
I promise.

01:24:36.687 --> 01:24:38.712
I want to help you.

01:24:38.756 --> 01:24:39.916
There's no hurry.

01:24:39.957 --> 01:24:42.983
It's safer in here now.

01:24:43.027 --> 01:24:46.019
It'll get worse out there.

01:24:46.063 --> 01:24:47.257
Why?

01:24:50.635 --> 01:24:53.399
Every species can smell
its own extinction.

01:24:53.437 --> 01:24:56.565
The last ones left...

01:24:56.607 --> 01:24:58.905
won't have a pretty time of it.

01:24:58.943 --> 01:25:04.210
And in ten years, maybe less...

01:25:04.248 --> 01:25:08.014
the human race
will just be a bedtime story...

01:25:08.052 --> 01:25:09.383
for their children.

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.184
A myth. Nothing more.

01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:35.408
Did he have anything to say?

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.980
No. It was useless.

01:25:39.016 --> 01:25:41.780
He thinks he's fiction...

01:25:41.819 --> 01:25:44.754
and that Sutter Cane's
causing the epidemic.

01:25:47.325 --> 01:25:50.726
Do you read Sutter Cane?

01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:46.309
Oh, God!

01:28:33.657 --> 01:28:35.625
I'll try and continue...

01:28:35.659 --> 01:28:38.787
this emergency broadcast as long
as we can hold out here.

01:28:38.829 --> 01:28:42.094
Um, the city is almost
completely deserted now.

01:28:42.132 --> 01:28:44.623
There are only a few stragglers
left on the streets.

01:28:44.668 --> 01:28:46.898
There are
no emergency services.

01:28:46.937 --> 01:28:50.236
The fires continue
to burn out of control.

01:28:50.274 --> 01:28:54.108
This incredible epidemic
of random mass killing...

01:28:54.144 --> 01:28:56.874
has spread to every country
in the civilized world.

01:28:56.914 --> 01:29:00.247
Every hour, more people
are becoming infected...

01:29:00.284 --> 01:29:04.015
being driven to senseless
acts of extreme violence.

01:29:04.054 --> 01:29:06.614
We have gotten reports,
sketchy at best...

01:29:06.657 --> 01:29:10.889
of people mutating, their bodies
swelling and distorting...

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:13.328
changing somehow.

01:29:13.364 --> 01:29:16.492
Locally, the mass killings
appear to have moved inland.

01:29:16.567 --> 01:29:19.092
All the major cities
on the East Coast are silent.

01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:20.535
We lost contact
with Los Angeles...

01:29:20.571 --> 01:29:22.368
and the West Coast last night...

01:29:22.406 --> 01:29:24.340
so it's impossible
at this time to know...

01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:26.775
how many unaffected people
are left.

01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:29.938
If for any reason...

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.972
you are one of us
who hasn't become infected...

01:29:33.017 --> 01:29:34.746
take shelter immediately.

01:29:34.785 --> 01:29:36.776
Do not trust any friends
or family members.

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.880
I repeat... Do not...

01:29:48.699 --> 01:29:51.827
I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!

01:29:51.869 --> 01:29:53.393
What?!

01:29:53.437 --> 01:29:55.769
I am not insane.

01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:59.264
Do you hear me?
I am not insane!

01:30:02.446 --> 01:30:05.415
Relax, buddy.
You're awake now.

01:30:07.017 --> 01:30:09.815
This is not a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!

01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:11.548
Not reality! Not reality!

01:30:11.589 --> 01:30:14.080
This is reality.
