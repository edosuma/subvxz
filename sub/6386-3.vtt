00:14.863 --> 00:16.297
Morning, sunshine.

00:16.331 --> 00:18.198
First day
of the rest of your life.

00:18.233 --> 00:19.633
Up and at 'em.

00:20.470 --> 00:23.694
Rise and shine,
and give God your glory.

00:23.814 --> 00:26.373
Oh, fuckness.

00:26.408 --> 00:29.410
Yeah, having your stomach
pumped will do that to you.

00:29.444 --> 00:31.545
Sorry I can't keep you
any longer.

00:33.615 --> 00:35.082
That's a shame.

00:35.116 --> 00:36.717
I was just beginning
to acclimate.

00:36.751 --> 00:40.354
5150 hold is only 72 hours max.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.556
You're obviously not crazy.

00:42.590 --> 00:43.957
Obviously.

00:43.992 --> 00:45.459
Do yourself a favor.

00:45.493 --> 00:46.860
Stay away from the drugs.

00:46.895 --> 00:48.195
I don't like the drugs, doc.

00:48.229 --> 00:50.197
The drugs like me.

00:50.231 --> 00:52.032
Cute, clever.

00:52.067 --> 00:54.835
Live fast, die young,
good-looking corpse.

00:54.869 --> 00:56.670
Guess what, asshole?

00:56.705 --> 00:58.839
There's no such thing
as a good-looking corpse.

00:58.873 --> 01:00.107
I see a lot of them,

01:00.141 --> 01:01.342
and they're
fucking ugly as shit,

01:01.376 --> 01:02.609
and they smell like shit too.

01:02.644 --> 01:03.844
You wanna know why?

01:03.878 --> 01:05.312
Because there's literally shit

01:05.346 --> 01:07.348
oozing out
of every goddamn hole.

01:07.382 --> 01:08.749
So keep it up, chuckles,

01:08.783 --> 01:10.818
and I'll be seeing you again
real soon.

01:10.852 --> 01:11.819
Bye now, buh-bye.

01:11.853 --> 01:13.253
Fuck.

01:13.288 --> 01:15.756
Hey.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.157
Oh, my lord.

01:17.192 --> 01:19.159
They must have given me
too much morphine,

01:19.194 --> 01:21.795
because I am hallucinating.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.565
How are you?
How are you feeling?

01:24.599 --> 01:27.768
Like I've been rode wet
and put away hard.

01:27.802 --> 01:30.838
I hear that.

01:30.872 --> 01:31.872
Morning, Hank.

01:31.906 --> 01:32.973
Morning, Marv.
How's it hanging?

01:35.777 --> 01:38.178
- Oh, lord.
- Oh, my God.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.120
Wait... Ooh.

01:46.154 --> 01:47.454
Oh, hey.

01:52.961 --> 02:02.561
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:55.457 --> 02:57.691
Are you for real
or is this your avatar?

02:57.725 --> 03:00.694
Will you stop asking me that?

03:00.728 --> 03:02.062
You didn't have
to give me the bed.

03:02.096 --> 03:04.398
I would have taken the couch,
the floor, anything.

03:04.432 --> 03:07.267
Shut up.

03:07.302 --> 03:10.804
Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

03:10.839 --> 03:12.306
God damn.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.574
You're just being so nice,

03:13.608 --> 03:16.076
it's like I died
and went to heaven after all.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.244
Sit down.

03:17.278 --> 03:18.679
The doctor said
you need to rest.

03:18.713 --> 03:21.348
No, I'm fine.
I'm good, I'm good.

03:21.382 --> 03:23.283
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

03:23.318 --> 03:24.718
That's not funny.

03:24.752 --> 03:26.286
- Dead tired.
- Not funny.

03:26.321 --> 03:28.522
- A little funny?
- Not really.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.525
Maybe you're right.
Too soon?

03:31.559 --> 03:32.826
Yeah.

03:32.861 --> 03:35.929
I'll try again after lunch.

03:35.964 --> 03:37.498
Hank.

03:37.532 --> 03:39.032
Hmm?

03:39.067 --> 03:41.101
I was scared.

03:41.135 --> 03:42.402
I know, baby.

03:42.437 --> 03:44.071
I thought you were gonna die.

03:44.105 --> 03:47.274
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

03:47.308 --> 03:52.679
I mean, I was so busy
being mad at you,

03:52.714 --> 03:55.148
I had no idea
how much pain you were in.

03:55.183 --> 03:58.151
Well, it ain't easy being me.

03:58.186 --> 04:01.088
You've always been able
to laugh it off

04:01.122 --> 04:04.925
and find humor in the most
fucked-up situations.

04:04.959 --> 04:07.995
So for you... for you to want
to go and kill yourself,

04:08.029 --> 04:11.231
I mean, you must
have been in agony,

04:11.266 --> 04:13.133
and I just didn't...

04:13.167 --> 04:16.637
I mean, however furious
I am with you,

04:16.671 --> 04:18.572
even when I hate
your fucking guts,

04:18.606 --> 04:21.241
at least I know
you're out there,

04:21.276 --> 04:23.010
that I'm gonna see you again.

04:23.044 --> 04:26.079
Honey.

04:26.114 --> 04:31.618
I didn't mean to force
moisture from your face.

04:31.653 --> 04:33.620
And I'm glad you feel that way.

04:36.291 --> 04:37.925
But I gotta be honest.

04:37.959 --> 04:41.595
What?

04:41.629 --> 04:42.796
What?

04:46.801 --> 04:49.703
I love you.

04:49.737 --> 04:52.806
And I'm sorry...

04:52.840 --> 04:55.609
For everything.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.278
Just don't do that again, okay?

04:58.313 --> 05:00.347
I mean, no matter
how bad it gets,

05:00.381 --> 05:02.015
you call me, you text me,

05:02.050 --> 05:04.751
you Skype me, you tweet me,

05:04.786 --> 05:06.887
you can fucking Facebook me,
I don't care.

05:06.921 --> 05:11.358
I just... Nothing should be
that bad, okay?

05:11.392 --> 05:13.060
You promise?

05:13.094 --> 05:15.095
Well, texting is for faggots,
but I promise.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.367
Good. No.

05:20.401 --> 05:22.369
No, no.
No, no.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.345
Fuck.

05:33.881 --> 05:35.816
Okay.

05:43.358 --> 05:45.459
You're a cheap date,
you know that?

05:45.493 --> 05:47.494
Well, when you come
perilously close

05:47.528 --> 05:49.296
to shucking off
this mortal coil,

05:49.330 --> 05:51.231
you realize what's important.

05:51.265 --> 05:52.866
A burger, fries,

05:52.900 --> 05:54.868
a nice cold root beer
to wash it down.

05:54.902 --> 05:57.371
Priorities.

05:58.439 --> 06:00.907
Karen thinks I tried
to kill myself.

06:00.942 --> 06:03.677
Well, you did leave
a suicide note.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.545
It was a letter, douche bag.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.780
A letter to Becca.

06:06.814 --> 06:08.215
I was just putting
my thoughts in order

06:08.249 --> 06:09.449
when I was rudely interrupted

06:09.484 --> 06:11.118
by the ill effects
of self-medicating.

06:11.152 --> 06:13.253
Hey, I'm just glad
you have the impulse

06:13.287 --> 06:15.589
to write something.

06:15.623 --> 06:16.757
Don't.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.692
Don't you dare.
Don't ask.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.927
I have to.
It's my job.

06:20.962 --> 06:23.730
So how's it coming?

06:23.765 --> 06:25.198
Just get me out of it, Charlie.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.567
I can't focus on a stupid
fucking screenplay right now.

06:27.602 --> 06:29.002
I can't do that.

06:29.037 --> 06:30.604
Stu's been calling.

06:30.638 --> 06:32.372
- Stu?
- The producer.

06:32.407 --> 06:33.974
He's paying you
out of his own pocket,

06:34.008 --> 06:35.242
did you know that?

06:35.276 --> 06:36.510
I haven't seen any money.

06:36.544 --> 06:38.145
It's tied up
with the attorneys.

06:38.179 --> 06:39.813
Perfect.
No harm, no foul.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.848
Then we're even.
That's it, I'm out.

06:41.883 --> 06:43.784
It doesn't work that way.

06:43.818 --> 06:45.786
He needs a good script.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.521
A good script attracts talent.

06:47.555 --> 06:48.822
Talent attracts money.

06:48.856 --> 06:50.090
You write a good script,

06:50.124 --> 06:53.326
and they will come
all over your face, baby.

06:55.863 --> 06:57.898
Oh, Jesus.

06:57.932 --> 06:59.633
I'm nauseous.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.169
Hey, you know what's weird?

07:02.203 --> 07:04.638
I'm horny as fuck.

07:04.672 --> 07:07.908
No, seriously, I beat off twice
this morning.

07:07.942 --> 07:09.443
Oh, okay, fine.

07:09.477 --> 07:11.611
I made love to myself.

07:11.646 --> 07:12.946
Christ on a stick, Karen,

07:12.980 --> 07:14.748
what is it about talking
about masturbation

07:14.782 --> 07:16.750
that freaks you out so much?

07:16.784 --> 07:19.519
You know you love
to flick that bean of yours.

07:19.554 --> 07:21.054
You do!

07:21.089 --> 07:22.989
Fuck you, don't hang up.

07:23.024 --> 07:26.693
Runkle! Runkle!

07:26.728 --> 07:29.362
Where are you, Runkle?

07:29.397 --> 07:30.931
Hey, is this Runkle's house?

07:30.965 --> 07:32.466
Uh, who's asking?

07:32.500 --> 07:34.101
Where is that
slippery son of a bitch?

07:34.135 --> 07:35.368
Is he inside?

07:35.403 --> 07:37.104
Who the fuck are you?

07:37.138 --> 07:39.239
Sorry, Stu Beggs.

07:39.273 --> 07:40.974
Nice to meet you.

07:41.008 --> 07:44.010
Marcy. Pleasure.

07:44.045 --> 07:46.179
You're the wife?

07:46.214 --> 07:47.514
Soon to be ex.

07:47.548 --> 07:48.915
Interesting.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.051
What's so interesting about it?

07:51.085 --> 07:52.719
So where is he?

07:52.754 --> 07:54.488
I left word with him,
like, a dozen times,

07:54.522 --> 07:58.058
and the shiny fuck
is not returning my calls.

07:58.092 --> 07:59.626
I don't know
where the fuck he is.

07:59.660 --> 08:01.161
Lunch with a client probably.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.395
Moody?

08:02.430 --> 08:03.764
How'd you guess?

08:03.798 --> 08:06.199
Well, as far as I know,
Runkle only has one client.

08:06.234 --> 08:08.869
You're way too hot for him,
by the way.

08:08.903 --> 08:10.203
Thanks.

08:10.238 --> 08:11.872
I always thought so.

08:11.906 --> 08:14.074
Didn't stop him from waving
his thin, bent wang

08:14.108 --> 08:15.308
at anything that bleeds,
though.

08:15.343 --> 08:17.144
Well, you know what they say.

08:17.178 --> 08:18.712
No matter how gorgeous the gal,

08:18.746 --> 08:22.149
there's always some fella
that's tired of banging her.

08:22.183 --> 08:24.117
Well, you know what I say.

08:24.152 --> 08:26.186
No matter how bald the fella,

08:26.220 --> 08:28.321
there's always some gal
who's tired of dealing

08:28.356 --> 08:30.423
with his erectile dysfunction.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.994
You want to grab
a drink sometime?

08:34.028 --> 08:35.428
With you?

08:35.462 --> 08:37.631
Yes.

08:37.664 --> 08:40.567
Who else is asking?

08:40.601 --> 08:42.669
I don't know, Stu.

08:42.703 --> 08:46.139
Life is <i>mucho complicado</i>
right now, Stu.

08:46.174 --> 08:49.209
I'm kind of in the final
death throes of a marriage

08:49.243 --> 08:51.611
and the last days of Escrow,
and...

08:51.646 --> 08:53.880
And what?

08:53.915 --> 08:55.916
What?

08:55.950 --> 08:58.518
And you remind me
of Charlie, physically.

08:58.553 --> 08:59.619
I'm just saying.

08:59.654 --> 09:01.655
Oh, God!

09:01.689 --> 09:02.989
Do I have anything left?

09:03.024 --> 09:05.559
I mean, I'm checking.

09:05.593 --> 09:07.794
No, you're like his fucking
doppelganger, Stu.

09:07.829 --> 09:09.863
You're all bald
and pear-shaped and shit.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.532
It's really kind of
creeping me out.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.201
You know, Marcy,
that all may be true,

09:14.235 --> 09:17.904
but I'm also rich as fuck
and hung like a moose.

09:21.075 --> 09:22.809
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:29.784 --> 09:31.184
Mmm.

09:33.588 --> 09:35.188
♪ ♪

10:08.856 --> 10:09.990
Come on.

10:10.024 --> 10:11.424
Let's pay up.

10:11.459 --> 10:12.659
Don't listen and not pay,
come on.

10:12.693 --> 10:13.760
Don't be cheap.

10:13.794 --> 10:16.062
Let's... There we go.

10:16.097 --> 10:18.365
Sounded great, honey.

10:18.399 --> 10:19.766
What you saving up for?

10:19.800 --> 10:21.167
A place of my own.

10:21.202 --> 10:23.203
Oh, cool.

10:23.237 --> 10:24.237
Where?

10:24.272 --> 10:25.238
The Valley.

10:25.273 --> 10:28.508
Oh, dear.
Why?

10:28.542 --> 10:30.210
- Cheap rent.
- Got ya.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.713
But you know what,
I bet your mom would be happy

10:33.748 --> 10:34.881
to keep a roof over your head

10:34.916 --> 10:36.716
and maybe even give you
three squares a day.

10:36.751 --> 10:37.951
And then you can
save your money

10:37.985 --> 10:39.920
and spend it on cool stuff,

10:39.954 --> 10:41.855
like booze and smokes.

10:41.889 --> 10:45.292
Yeah, I don't laugh
as easily as I used to.

10:45.326 --> 10:47.227
Don't I know it.

10:47.261 --> 10:49.396
Guess things aren't as funny
as they used to be.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.731
We're gonna have to work
on that, sweetheart.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.168
Is everything okay?

10:55.202 --> 10:58.371
Is there anything you want
to talk about?

10:58.406 --> 11:03.243
I know I must have given you
a pretty big scare, honey.

11:03.277 --> 11:04.377
Honey?

11:06.914 --> 11:08.648
Nope, I'm good.

11:08.683 --> 11:10.216
Better get back at it.

11:10.251 --> 11:12.052
Plenty of day left.

11:12.086 --> 11:13.320
Yeah.

11:13.354 --> 11:15.722
Okay, well, you mind
if I just sit here and watch

11:15.756 --> 11:18.925
and listen and be your groupie?

11:18.960 --> 11:21.895
I'd prefer you didn't.
It makes me freeze up.

to kill himself.

21:44.451 --> 21:46.919
He wouldn't do something
like that to me.

21:46.954 --> 21:50.089
So where's this father
you're talking about?

21:50.123 --> 21:52.325
Where is he?

21:52.359 --> 21:56.295
Because I sure don't see him
around here anymore.

22:04.905 --> 22:07.306
You're right.

22:07.341 --> 22:09.575
I wouldn't do that.

22:09.610 --> 22:12.612
I didn't.

22:15.415 --> 22:18.618
Okay?

22:18.652 --> 22:22.154
Come on, look at me.

22:22.189 --> 22:24.890
I just needed
a decent night's sleep.

22:24.925 --> 22:26.425
I drank a little too much,

22:26.460 --> 22:28.327
and I took
a few too many pills.

22:28.362 --> 22:30.963
I screwed up yet again.

22:30.998 --> 22:34.200
But I would never,

22:34.234 --> 22:37.970
ever give up on you like that.

22:38.005 --> 22:41.040
Do you understand me?

22:46.013 --> 22:48.047
Now tell her that.

22:48.081 --> 22:51.484
What?

22:51.518 --> 22:53.519
Tell her what you just told me.

22:53.553 --> 22:55.221
Becca.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.090
What?

22:58.125 --> 22:59.325
It's nothing.

22:59.359 --> 23:00.926
She's upset.

23:00.961 --> 23:02.094
Tell her what you said

23:02.129 --> 23:04.196
so she doesn't have
the wrong idea.

23:04.231 --> 23:06.832
What's she talking about?

23:06.867 --> 23:09.902
You know what, I think
we should all just chill.

23:09.936 --> 23:11.671
Chillax, really.

23:11.705 --> 23:12.905
You know,
I'm calling a time-out.

23:12.939 --> 23:14.073
Hank.

23:14.107 --> 23:16.208
He didn't try to kill himself.

23:16.243 --> 23:20.146
He just fucked up again.

23:22.182 --> 23:23.349
What?

23:23.383 --> 23:26.252
Was I trying to numb the pain?

23:26.286 --> 23:27.787
Yeah, sure.

23:27.821 --> 23:29.655
What are you saying?

23:29.690 --> 23:33.092
I was drinking heavily,

23:33.126 --> 23:37.730
and I miscalculated.

23:37.764 --> 23:38.998
So what are you saying,

23:39.032 --> 23:41.600
that you partied too hard
and then you passed out,

23:41.635 --> 23:44.403
just like any other day
ending in "y"?

23:44.438 --> 23:46.639
That it was all just
a stupid, big mistake?

23:46.673 --> 23:48.808
In a word, yes.

23:57.384 --> 24:00.019
How could you let me...
I mean, how could you do that?

24:00.053 --> 24:01.821
How could I not?

24:01.855 --> 24:04.156
You were being so nice to me,
it was like a dream come true.

24:04.191 --> 24:05.491
I thought I was home again.

24:05.525 --> 24:07.493
But it was a fucking lie!

24:07.527 --> 24:09.228
Hey, just because I wasn't
suicidal then

24:09.262 --> 24:11.197
doesn't mean
I'm not suicidal now.

24:11.231 --> 24:13.365
I mean, I would keep me away
from cutlery if I were you.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.867
I'm feeling
pretty fucking fragile.

24:14.901 --> 24:17.737
Get out, okay?
Just get the fuck out!

24:17.771 --> 24:18.938
So, wait, it was more romantic

24:18.972 --> 24:20.272
when you thought I wanted
to kill myself?

24:20.307 --> 24:21.340
How fucked up is that?

24:21.374 --> 24:22.708
It's completely fucked up,

24:22.743 --> 24:25.244
which is why I can't
be around you anymore!

24:25.278 --> 24:27.713
You're fucking toxic, Hank.

24:27.748 --> 24:28.881
Look, I know
that I've done something

24:28.915 --> 24:30.449
that makes it impossible
for you to live with me,

24:30.484 --> 24:34.920
but I can't keep apologizing
for something I can't change.

24:34.955 --> 24:36.255
All I can do
is keep moving forward

24:36.289 --> 24:39.225
and try to become someone
that you can love again.

24:39.259 --> 24:40.926
Well, good luck with that.

24:47.334 --> 24:48.868
Way to go, dad.

24:48.902 --> 24:52.104
Now I have to listen
to her cry all night again.
