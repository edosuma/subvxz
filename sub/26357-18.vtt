WEBVTT

00:15.616 --> 00:17.017
I love a good panel.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.486
Krusty clearly hates
being there,

00:18.519 --> 00:21.389
but he still gets super mad
when anyone but him talks.

00:21.422 --> 00:24.558
Please welcome
the legendary stars

00:24.592 --> 00:26.927
of the Krusty the Clown Show.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.396
(cheering)

00:28.429 --> 00:29.663
Hey-hey!

00:29.697 --> 00:32.266
And a non-writing producer.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.934
Ooh, non-writing.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.669
Hey-hey, kids!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
ALL:
Hey-hey, Krusty!

00:37.471 --> 00:41.075
Have we got a great panel
planned for you today.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.043
What is it, Howard,
the usual crap?

00:43.077 --> 00:46.714
Oh, yeah,
that'll kill some time.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.120
(audience screams)

00:52.153 --> 00:53.521
(grunting)

00:53.554 --> 00:56.957
Kids, call the police!
This isn't a sketch!

00:56.990 --> 00:58.058
(groans)

00:58.092 --> 00:59.059
Ah.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.394
My legs!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.062
Stick to the script.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.298
(straining):
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04.332 --> 01:07.067
Miami Sound Machine.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.336
♪ Come on, shake... ♪

01:09.970 --> 01:11.539
Where do you come up
with your ideas?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.441
I'm a genius. Next.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.777
-Are there any plans...
-BOTH: For another Krusty movie?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.647
We're waiting for a story
that needs to be told.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.083
Once we see that, we'll copy it
and call it a parody.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.253
Oy. Does anyone have a question

01:25.286 --> 01:27.688
that hasn't been asked
a thousand times?

01:29.757 --> 01:32.593
I have the worst fans
in the world.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.728
Now we've got a big surprise

01:34.762 --> 01:37.498
for the best fans in the world!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.767
We're making some big changes

01:39.800 --> 01:41.969
to your favorite cartoon.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.273
-(audience gasps)
-MAN: It's different.

01:45.306 --> 01:49.143
It's an all-female reboot
of Itchy & Scratchy!

01:49.177 --> 01:52.646
BOTH:
Oh, my God!

01:52.680 --> 01:56.083
Pretty enlightened, eh, kids?
We here at the Krusty Show

01:56.116 --> 01:58.118
really care
about gender diversity.

01:58.152 --> 02:01.855
Ask anyone: our lawyers,
our attorneys, anyone.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.357
A girl Itchy & Scratchy?

02:03.391 --> 02:05.459
No, no, no, this can't be.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.628
They've ruined my childhood.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.963
Your childhood
is currently happening.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.199
That's how I know.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.833
It doesn't make any sense.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.469
In real life,
Itchy and Scratchy are dudes.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.172
Girl mice don't have
the upper body strength

02:18.206 --> 02:19.373
to wield a chain saw.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.542
Is truth dead?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.644
BOYS:
Boo!

02:23.677 --> 02:26.814
Ah, you boys are leaving me
for video games anyway.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.217
Zap, zap, zap,
you'll all die alone.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.118
Girl power is where it's at.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.354
That movie where Superman
was a chick

02:33.387 --> 02:36.524
made a megillah of shekels.
Am I right, ladies?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.326
(girls cheering)

02:38.359 --> 02:40.394
See? Girls like my pandering.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.163
Remember this if there's
ever a gender war.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.165
Oh, this is the worst change

02:45.199 --> 02:47.401
Krusty's ever made to the show,

02:47.435 --> 02:50.338
even worse than
Sideshow Leonard Cohen.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.005
When girl Itchy & Scratchy
comes on,

02:52.039 --> 02:53.541
we should totally hate-watch it.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.009
No, everybody come over
to my house,

02:56.043 --> 02:57.811
and we'll turn off
the TV the second

02:57.845 --> 02:59.046
that girl cartoon comes on.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.215
We'll hate-not-watch it.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.651
Yeah! Hate-not-watch!

03:03.684 --> 03:06.220
Yeah, that won't not show 'em.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.023
I never really thought
about Itchy and Scratchy

03:10.057 --> 03:14.027
as male or female, but it is
cool that they're girls now.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.096
I always thought
they were a married couple,

03:16.129 --> 03:17.998
and that's why
they fought so much.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.434
Mom, they're different species.

03:20.468 --> 03:23.471
I don't know what to be
liberal about anymore.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.908
I am so pumped to hate-not-watch
Itchy & Scratchy.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.744
I've not popped the popcorn,
the lights are not turned down.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.012
Perfect.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.015
Listen, son, I'm proud that
you're starting to hate things,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.049
but take it slow.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.352
If you use up all your hate
when you're young,

03:38.386 --> 03:42.055
one day you'll be an old man
who likes things that suck.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.091
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
Tonight, cabbage.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.894
It is a lovely shade of gray,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.229
and just look at the wrinkling.

03:50.398 --> 03:54.034
All I'm saying is, if they ever
make a female Mr. Magoo,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.804
I will lose it,
I will just lose it!

03:56.837 --> 03:58.071
KRUSTY (on TV):
Hey-hey, kids!

03:58.105 --> 04:00.207
It's time to tickle
your funny bones

04:00.240 --> 04:04.111
and your Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission bones

04:04.144 --> 04:07.147
by presenting
the all-new, all-female

04:07.180 --> 04:09.149
Itchy & Scratchy!

04:09.182 --> 04:11.752
Now to sit in silence
till it's over.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.954
Blindfolds on, gentlemen.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.225
This is Lisa Simpson,

04:18.258 --> 04:21.161
recording my reaction
to this historic moment

04:21.194 --> 04:23.797
in cartoon women's history.

And guess what, you laughed!
It was funny.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.017
I-I wasn't laughing.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.688
I-I was crying a-and burping!

05:22.322 --> 05:25.125
And... open.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.226
We did it.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.629
We prejudged something
without giving it a chance.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.031
I am so proud of us.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.702
Like Bart Simpson would ever
watch a girl Itchy & Scratchy.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.237
Never gonna happen.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.506
-(grunting)
-Yeah.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.475
That little liar.
If only people could know

05:41.509 --> 05:44.378
that Bart laughed
even harder than I did...

05:44.412 --> 05:45.913
(gasps)

05:45.946 --> 05:48.582
All right,
you soda-squirting hypocrite,

05:48.616 --> 05:51.385
I know exactly what to do
with this video.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421
♪

05:58.025 --> 05:59.993
TOSHUA JOSH (on TV):
Welcome to Josh.0,

06:00.027 --> 06:02.763
the show for people who want
to look at the Internet

06:02.796 --> 06:05.165
but don't have a computer
or a phone.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.436
You know what bugs me
about old guys at the gym?

06:08.469 --> 06:11.872
They always forget
to wipe down the machine.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.675
(laughing):
He means the blood.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.446
Now, this boy says he hates
all-girl Itchy & Scratchy,

06:18.479 --> 06:20.347
but then this happened...

06:20.380 --> 06:22.883
(laughing)

06:22.916 --> 06:25.118
Bart, you got to see this!

06:25.152 --> 06:27.521
Some old guy at a gym
got hit by a boat!

06:27.555 --> 06:31.291
Also, now everyone knows you're
the world's biggest hypocrite.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.293
(laughing)

06:33.326 --> 06:37.030
(laughing):
You said you weren't gonna
watch it,

06:37.064 --> 06:39.867
and then you did
and you loved it!

06:39.900 --> 06:44.071
Then you got busted and I called
you in here and laughed at you!

06:44.104 --> 06:47.140
And I'm still doing it!

06:47.174 --> 06:49.042
Look at you.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.044
What a jerk.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.079
(Bart groans)

06:57.618 --> 07:01.121
Well, Bart, how does it feel
to be trolled, memed, giffed,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.390
and, dare I say, pwned?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.058
How do you know those words?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.327
I read about them
in Parade magazine.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.330
Big deal, I was exposed
as a liar on the Internet.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.834
I've got so much cred built up,
nothing can take me down.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.969
You betrayed us, Bart.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.972
And worse, you betrayed
your own wang.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.009
You know what?
Yes, I laughed at a cartoon.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.944
Why? Because it was funny.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.813
So what if Itchy and Scratchy
are girls?

07:25.846 --> 07:28.616
I laughed, and you can't
take back the laugh.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.950
Girls aren't funny.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.019
They're hot or moms.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.020
Or both.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.355
Girls stole Itchy and Scratchy.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.626
What are they gonna take next,
our body spray?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.761
Our puka shell necklaces?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.530
-Yeah!
-Lame!

07:42.563 --> 07:45.999
Girls get everything:
bigger, softer baseballs,

07:46.033 --> 07:49.603
chick flicks,
two-piece bathing suits,

07:49.637 --> 07:51.471
and on House Hunters
International,

07:51.505 --> 07:54.174
they always choose
the house that she wants.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.544
He's right.
The wife gets the beach view,

07:56.577 --> 07:59.479
but it's always a longer commute
for the husband.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.148
-You know, you're right.
-Oh, yeah.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.482
You guys see what's happening?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.718
You're listening to Milhouse!

08:04.752 --> 08:07.320
So? Maybe we are.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.823
MILHOUSE:
They are listening to me.

08:09.857 --> 08:13.627
The next thing I say
must be perfectly chosen

08:13.661 --> 08:16.463
to show I am worthy
of leadership.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.731
Get him!

08:17.765 --> 08:19.867
(shouting)

08:19.900 --> 08:21.869

08:36.283 --> 08:38.485
(hissing)

08:38.518 --> 08:42.255
(gasps) Sixth graders. Tweens.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.992
What are you doing
in the girl's room, Seat Soaker?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.994
No, no, I didn't mean
to come in here.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.596
I need sanctuary.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.065
Hey, you guys have
a candy machine? No fair.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.401
Spin him till he barfs.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.903
Ah!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.105
I'm full of hummus and milk!

08:58.138 --> 09:00.140
(groaning)

09:02.375 --> 09:04.211
Pink spray paint?

09:04.244 --> 09:07.547
Give that back.
That's for Skinner's office.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.183
You tell anyone about this,
you're canceled.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.720
Charlie Rose canceled.

09:12.753 --> 09:16.389
No, no, no, you can trust me.
I'm not just any fourth grader.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.560
Whoa, this dude's El Barto.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.197
Huh, I always thought it was
that fifth grader, Eloise Barto.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.099
Yeah, sometimes
I get her e-mail.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.702
You know, if you fill up
a leaf blower with paint,

09:28.736 --> 09:30.570
you can coat
Skinner's whole office.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.973
-Duh.
-Double duh.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.542
Where are we gonna get
a leaf blower?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.144
Willie's shack.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.478
(sound of bagpipes playing)

09:40.848 --> 09:43.383
Whoa, homemade prank masks.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.185
The knit is on.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.158
This'll teach Skinner
to ban sandals.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.794
Oh, he will not
silence our toes.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.328
Hurry, Skinner's almost back

09:55.362 --> 09:57.264
from his lunchtime
dog-walking job.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.399
(humming)

09:59.432 --> 10:01.434
(door opens)

10:03.203 --> 10:05.639
I will not negotiate
with terrorists.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.608
I'll just give in.
Sandals unbanned.

10:10.377 --> 10:14.147
Ladies, that was smooth,
Barbie smooth.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.949
So smooth.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.285
Hey, why are you still here,
truck-nuts?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.287
Whoa, is this your hideout?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.122
It's the old Home Ec classroom,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.691
where they would brainwash girls

10:23.724 --> 10:25.425
into being good
little housewives,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.027
but now it's our war room.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.429
Also, we cook here,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.998
we do a little bit of sewing.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.800
Stop telling him things!

10:32.833 --> 10:35.168
Cooties be damned,
you girls are badass

10:35.202 --> 10:36.704
and your pranks are next level.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.772
Take a seat and learn something.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.941
We don't do "pranks,"

10:40.974 --> 10:43.143
we drop awareness bombs.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.613
Our protest crew
is called Bossy Riot.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.381
We're pushing back
against the pushback,

10:48.415 --> 10:50.383
starting with this school.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.353
Look at this his-tory book.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.022
BART:
Cool shades.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.828
That is textbook
textbook shredding.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.662
Now do you see
what we're doing here?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.664
I think I do.

11:04.698 --> 11:09.002
You're sticking it to the man,
but this time, the man is men.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.038
Look, you got to let me
join your gang.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.707
You know, if we're really
serious about gender equality,

11:13.741 --> 11:16.243
it's only right
that a boy be our servant.

11:16.276 --> 11:20.814
Okay, No-varies, you're in,
if you pass this test...

11:20.848 --> 11:23.683
Steal Skinner's cell phone.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.585
Work or personal?

11:25.618 --> 11:27.454
-CHALMERS: Skinner!
-AGNES: Seymour!

11:28.521 --> 11:30.523
Welcome to girlhood.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.064
Gentlemen, our way of life

11:37.097 --> 11:39.399
-is under attack.
-Hear, hear!

11:39.432 --> 11:42.669
Society is trying to erase boys.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.873
They give us drugs that make us
do girly things,

11:45.906 --> 11:47.674
like pay attention.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.677
They're putting drugs
in our medication?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.079
We need to band together.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.714
Like a sorority, but for dudes.

11:54.748 --> 11:58.585
I give you
the Boys Rights Association.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.888
-BOYS: BRA!
-B-R-A.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.956
-Right now,
we're just training BRAs.
-Mm-hmm.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.392
But soon,
we'll be the strongest,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.962
most supportive BRAs
anyone has ever seen.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.933
(chanting):
We are BRAs! We are BRAs!

12:12.966 --> 12:15.903
Our son has one, two...
(gasps)

12:15.936 --> 12:17.938
...eight friends.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.274
They're more than just friends,
he's-he's the leader.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.876
(exhales)

12:22.910 --> 12:24.978
I'm feeling this wave of relief,

12:25.012 --> 12:27.247
not worrying about
my son's social life.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.952
I can stop being a mother
and start being a... a woman.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.922
(exhales)
Say it. Say it again.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.958
Our son has friends.

BROCKMAN:
Springfield,

13:27.574 --> 13:29.142
a town living in fear,

13:29.176 --> 13:32.112
as masked pranksters
calling themselves "Bossy Riot,"

13:32.145 --> 13:34.647
spread their terrifying message
of female empowerment.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.985
The latest victim of this "gal
Qaeda," our once-proud symbol

13:38.018 --> 13:40.820
of the portly
pastry-purveying patriarchy.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.822
HOMER:
"Lard Lady"?

13:42.856 --> 13:46.359
But a donut is the ultimate
symbol of masculinity.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.229
The only lead police have
as to the identity of Bossy Riot

13:49.262 --> 13:51.564
is this security camera footage.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.466
(Homer laughs)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.502
HOMER:
Moe and his bats.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.172
Bossy Riot is so cool.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.974
We need fearless
female activists

14:01.008 --> 14:04.511
to fight back against misogyny
and man-spreading.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.248
Well, whoever they are,
they are the coolest badasses

14:08.281 --> 14:11.751
this town has ever seen,
whoever they are.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.221
Ooh, Bart winked at me.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.823
I must be in on a joke.
(chuckles)

14:16.856 --> 14:18.358
-(Bart humming)
-Hmm...

14:20.360 --> 14:24.597
-(screams)
-Bart, are you in Bossy Riot?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.666
-No way.
-Ah, good.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.002
Because if you were fighting
for women's rights,

14:29.036 --> 14:32.739
it would destroy my entire
vision of the universe.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.874
-Actually, I totally am.
-(shouts)

14:39.279 --> 14:41.114
You can't be an activist
for women's rights.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.083
You don't know anything
about the feminist cause.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.052
Sure I do.
Chicks get a raw deal.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.687
I'm a little fuzzy on the deets,
but take my word for it.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.024
(groans) It's all about
the deets. You're not a girl.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.094
-You just want to spray-paint
the world and watch it drip.
-Mm-hmm.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.097
You've never been called shrill
just because you speak up.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.934
And-and girls' clothing
has no pockets,

15:00.968 --> 15:03.703
while yours are lousy
with pockets!

15:03.736 --> 15:06.239
This is good stuff,
I got to write it down.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.544
(Bart humming)

15:11.578 --> 15:13.746
This is someone else's war,

15:13.780 --> 15:17.117
and you,
y-you're just a mercenary.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.419
Mercenaries are cool,
like Boba Fett.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.156
Oh, yeah, Boba Fett,
great character.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.559
Boba Fett's badass.
He wears a jetpack and a cape.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.061
Pick a lane, weirdo.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.097
Why does every discussion
about feminism

15:30.130 --> 15:32.932
turn into an argument
about Star Wars?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.968
If Boba Fett's such
a great bounty hunter,

15:35.002 --> 15:37.437
why is his armor all banged up?

15:37.470 --> 15:40.940
(sighs) It's a look,
like distressed denim.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.942
You shouldn't be
part of a protest

15:42.976 --> 15:45.178
if you don't care
about the cause.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.947
Well, you care.
Why don't you come with?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.616
Maybe I will.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.019
Great. Bring black gloves
and no ID.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.520
You've been Tasered
before, right?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.122
It only hurts
until you pass out.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.590
I'm excited;
I want to, I do, but...

15:57.624 --> 15:59.592
there's a part of me
that's scared,

15:59.626 --> 16:03.096
and that part is my body
and my head.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.364
It's okay, I get it.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.099
There's nothing wrong
with being all talk.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.468
Us feminists need
cheerleaders, too.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.536
(groans)

16:10.970 --> 16:14.207
So, what's up, my fellow
Ruthless Bader Ginsburgs?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.376
What's on the a-gender
for the evening?

16:16.409 --> 16:19.879
Your friends in the so-called
"Boys Rights Association"

16:19.912 --> 16:22.149
have been protesting
The Krusty Show.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.884
I told you
not to light the toys yet.

16:24.917 --> 16:28.355
I didn't,
they just burst into flames.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.058
Krusty caved.
He said he'd never show

16:31.091 --> 16:34.127
another all-girl
Itchy & Scratchy ever again.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.130
So we're gonna destroy
the master tapes

16:37.164 --> 16:39.866
of every Itchy & Scratchy.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.168
Wait, what? No.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.802
I love those cartoons.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.471
I can't let you do it.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.006
Oh, you can't "let" us?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.212
Don't have a lady cow.

16:52.245 --> 16:56.049
All cows are ladies.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.656
That thing you said about me
being all talk?

17:03.690 --> 17:07.160
Well, I have prepared
two comebacks,

17:07.194 --> 17:09.429
and I will now give you both.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.032
Those girls are gonna destroy
every Itchy & Scratchy, forever!

17:13.066 --> 17:16.035
(grunting)

17:16.069 --> 17:18.037
Hey, hey, boys and boys!

17:18.071 --> 17:19.872
Well, congratulations,

17:19.906 --> 17:23.076
I'm never gonna air the girl
Itchy & Scratchy again.

17:23.110 --> 17:27.714
You hit me where it hurts
the most: right in the sponsors.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.048
Buy 'em all.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.223
(gasps)
We're too late.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.195
They're going to destroy
the tapes on live TV.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.197
Let's get him
out of those bras and go.

17:44.231 --> 17:48.368
Uh, no, you can leave me
like this. I'm good.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.069
We are Bossy Riot,

17:50.103 --> 17:53.373
and we're gonna drop all
the original Itchy & Scratchys

17:53.406 --> 17:56.476
into a pool
of nail polish remover.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.744
(all gasping)

18:00.347 --> 18:04.050
That's crazy. We have those
backed up a thousand times.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.052
Right, Howard?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.055
What do you do?!

18:09.088 --> 18:11.057
Don't do it.
Those shows are funny.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.992
Mice killing cats,
guts everywhere.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.995
It doesn't matter
if it's boy guts or girl guts.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.397
Guts are guts.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.599
See, the thing
about comedy is...

18:19.632 --> 18:22.101
Bart, stop mansplaining!

18:22.135 --> 18:23.803
No, no, no, no,
if I keep talking,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.605
they'll get it eventually.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.479
(grunts)

18:37.049 --> 18:39.319
The fumes are burning my eyes.

18:39.352 --> 18:43.122
(all crying)

18:43.156 --> 18:47.126
Look, they're crying,
on live TV.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.129
Glitterize their tears.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.165
Mama!

19:07.914 --> 19:10.617
Don't worry, sir,
your brothers are united

19:10.650 --> 19:12.852
in blaming this on you.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.787
(shouting in agreement)

19:14.821 --> 19:16.823
(groans)

19:19.892 --> 19:21.828
Hey, hey! Come back here!

19:21.861 --> 19:24.531
You there, sweet innocent girls,

19:24.564 --> 19:28.034
did you see three crazed
man-haters run through here?

19:28.067 --> 19:30.903
Gee, Officer,
they went that way.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.039
Thanks, princess. Thank you.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.242
Wait a second.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.678
Do any of you babysit?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.547
Great. Be at my house
Saturday at 7:00.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.049
And if Ralph asks you
to give him a bath,

19:43.082 --> 19:45.352
do not give him a bath.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.054
So I guess I'm not
in the group anymore.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.223
You were never in the group.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.059
We just kept you around
for fingerprints and DNA.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.195
But making those boys cry
was hardcore.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.732
You, uh, ever think
about wearing the yarn?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.701
Me? Join you?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.237
Can I do it?
Can I push my beliefs further

20:04.271 --> 20:06.673
than they've ever gone?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
-Well, let us know.
-(clicks tongue)

20:10.943 --> 20:12.945
Mask me.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.718
("Extreme Ways" by Moby playing)

20:55.655 --> 20:57.724
So spill it, Simpson.
You were on the inside.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.492
What's the deal with girls?

20:59.526 --> 21:02.094
Well, check this out:
they also burp.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.096
No way. From where?

21:04.130 --> 21:05.932
Is that even allowed?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.300
Let's see, what else?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.302
They're always telling
each other they're pretty,

21:09.336 --> 21:11.971
their bathroom candy
tastes really weird,

21:12.004 --> 21:14.674
but there's one thing
that really crushed me.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.909
I almost don't want
to say it out loud.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.578
They don't envy us.
