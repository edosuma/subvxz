00:00.250 --> 00:01.726
Previously on Heartland...

00:01.847 --> 00:03.739
Ahmed, Gypsy is incredible!

00:03.746 --> 00:05.753
We need to train him as a puissance horse.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.822
He loves to jump, just
not the whole course.

00:07.844 --> 00:09.438
Just a single high jump.

00:09.453 --> 00:11.197
I think what you guys really need is...

00:11.384 --> 00:12.465
somebody with a real eye.

00:12.477 --> 00:14.713
Thanks for the interest
in partnering with us, Tim,

00:14.732 --> 00:16.909
but I'm gonna have to go
with my gut on this one.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.951
I would've been a lot better
partner than a competitor.

00:18.970 --> 00:20.225
You guys are married?

00:20.267 --> 00:21.025
Yeah, we are.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.287
How could you not tell us?!

00:22.373 --> 00:25.101
Ahmed, he wants me to keep Gypsy...

00:25.221 --> 00:26.506
As a gift.

00:28.573 --> 00:29.814
Oh my God.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.607
I'm sorry, boy. I can't do it.

01:15.350 --> 01:18.177
Okay... I know, I know, that sucked.

01:18.475 --> 01:19.512
But it's not his fault,

01:19.512 --> 01:21.825
I just haven't been
able to psych myself up.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.553
Where'd that big red wall come from?

01:23.554 --> 01:26.819
Hillhurst. One of the perks
of working for a prince.

01:27.085 --> 01:29.957
You gonna give me a hand? I
may need some moral support.

01:30.643 --> 01:33.222
Sorry, I got lots of homework and stuff.

01:34.621 --> 01:38.426
So, grandpa, will Lisa
be joining us for dinner?

01:38.454 --> 01:39.981
Nope.

01:40.283 --> 01:42.359
I think she'll be staying home tonight.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.619
Oh? And which home would that be?

01:46.859 --> 01:49.645
Come on, Lou, you know perfectly well.

01:49.658 --> 01:50.838
No, I don't.

01:50.958 --> 01:53.316
Where exactly is home for you guys?

01:53.436 --> 01:55.685
Well, here and there.

01:56.536 --> 01:59.316
I think you've hit on the
secret to a happy marriage:

01:59.436 --> 02:01.566
Don't live together, don't change anything,

02:01.572 --> 02:03.752
and most importantly, don't tell anyone.

02:03.770 --> 02:06.020
Oh, Lou.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.608
Hi, Georgie! How was school?

02:09.285 --> 02:10.782
There's fresh muffins.

02:11.068 --> 02:12.287
I'm not hungry.

02:12.624 --> 02:14.227
Wonder what's bugging her?

02:14.436 --> 02:16.410
What's bugging her? Honestly?

02:16.530 --> 02:18.340
What do you think is bugging her, grandpa?

02:18.358 --> 02:20.792
You and Lisa go off and
get married in secret,

02:20.827 --> 02:21.963
like we don't even matter to you.

02:21.976 --> 02:25.504
Lou, you are making way
too much out of this.

02:26.799 --> 02:30.018
Oh, I almost forgot.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.202
Peter called... your husband.

02:33.458 --> 02:34.702
He said he was at work,

02:34.724 --> 02:36.937
he'd call you again when he got home.

02:37.263 --> 02:41.155
You know, his home... in, uh,

02:41.368 --> 02:42.546
Vancouver.

02:48.853 --> 02:50.938
- Let's see what we got.
- All right.

03:02.741 --> 03:04.197
Whoa! Whoa!

03:09.816 --> 03:11.633
Ungh!

03:14.643 --> 03:17.474
- Hey! You all right?
- Yeah.

03:17.594 --> 03:18.512
Wow.

03:18.594 --> 03:21.760
Looks like you guys got yourself
a real good bucking horse there.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.487
Too bad you thought you
were getting a roper.

03:24.607 --> 03:26.031
What're you doing here, Tim?

03:26.263 --> 03:29.442
Me? Oh, I just picked up a
couple of retired racehorses

03:29.461 --> 03:30.604
at rock-bottom prices.

03:30.622 --> 03:32.186
What, you getting back
into the racing business?

03:32.214 --> 03:34.052
No, no. I'm gonna retrain
'em and sell them as jumpers.

03:34.071 --> 03:36.156
What about you guys? What're
doing other than eating dirt?

03:37.162 --> 03:39.020
Well, so far no sales.

03:39.066 --> 03:41.001
Yeah, we've had some
real sweet offers though.

03:41.004 --> 03:42.029
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.767
And we're kind of busy right now though.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.565
Okay. Well, I'd help you,

03:46.931 --> 03:48.514
but I know you don't want my help.

03:49.053 --> 03:50.462
Which is too bad, 'cause...

03:50.490 --> 03:51.715
if you did partner up with me,

03:51.715 --> 03:53.773
you wouldn't have six
horses and no buyers, but...

04:02.270 --> 04:04.200
Georgie?

04:05.142 --> 04:06.953
Brought you a muffin.

04:09.094 --> 04:11.458
Honey, are you okay?

04:11.874 --> 04:13.374
Yeah, I've just got a lot of homework.

04:13.612 --> 04:17.072
Okay.  The solar system!

04:17.148 --> 04:18.834
Hey, do you need any help? Because

04:18.861 --> 04:20.113
when I was in sixth grade,

04:20.142 --> 04:22.424
I made a working model, all nine planets.

04:22.438 --> 04:23.846
Actually, there are only eight.

04:23.966 --> 04:26.605
Pluto was downgraded from
a planet to a dwarf planet.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.807
Really?

04:28.200 --> 04:31.731
But a dwarf planet's still just
like a... little planet, right?

04:31.851 --> 04:34.922
Yeah, so is VP 113 and Sedan.

04:35.206 --> 04:37.199
Astronomers believe that...

04:37.521 --> 04:39.826
there are hundreds,
maybe even thousands more.

04:42.002 --> 04:43.374
Okay.

04:43.676 --> 04:45.999
Well, if you have any other questions or...

04:46.032 --> 04:48.203
Nope. Actually, I got it.

04:48.724 --> 04:50.402
Okay. Okay.

05:32.036 --> 05:36.157
Damn!

Well, if it isn't Hudson
county's most eligible bachelor!

06:26.968 --> 06:29.277
Well I'll be!

06:29.306 --> 06:31.309
How long's it been, Val?

06:31.334 --> 06:33.276
Three, four years? I don't know.

06:33.396 --> 06:35.033
Jack!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.923
It's so good to see you.

06:38.096 --> 06:39.844
So how're you doing?

06:39.844 --> 06:43.466
Well... you know, what can
I say? Florida's wonderful...

06:43.512 --> 06:46.731
the sunshine, the
people, the real estate...

06:46.767 --> 06:47.737
but...

06:47.857 --> 06:50.243
I had to come back.

06:50.252 --> 06:53.344
I feel pretty much the same
way every time I'm away.

06:53.344 --> 06:55.640
Which is what? Once a century?

06:55.760 --> 06:58.073
Oh, dunno. Might try
for twice this century.

06:59.975 --> 07:01.228
So what brings you home?

07:01.247 --> 07:03.240
I just decided I can't
deal with the business

07:03.259 --> 07:05.069
at Briar Ridge anymore...

07:05.087 --> 07:06.944
So I'm here to oversee the transition.

07:07.064 --> 07:08.407
Transition?

07:08.527 --> 07:11.728
Oh, you selling or hiring somebody?

07:11.763 --> 07:13.666
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.364
I want to keep it in the family.

07:23.846 --> 07:25.641
Amy.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.565
What, you're not gonna say hello?

07:28.685 --> 07:31.028
Jesse... Jesse Stanton?!

07:31.148 --> 07:33.532
Wow, you got it in one.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.416
- What?
- So, how you been?

07:35.435 --> 07:37.234
You just got back from Europe, right?

07:37.354 --> 07:38.672
Uh...

07:38.718 --> 07:40.740
Yeah, my mom and Ashley
keep me pretty up to date.

07:40.767 --> 07:41.572
Of course.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.484
Matter of fact, I heard
you're getting married

07:43.511 --> 07:45.332
to that guy I punched out in grade ten?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.535
Yes, Ty.

07:47.564 --> 07:48.944
Um, but the way I remember it,

07:48.962 --> 07:50.819
he kinda punched you out.

07:50.939 --> 07:53.197
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

07:53.224 --> 07:56.152
Well, good choice! I mean, a guy like that,

07:56.170 --> 07:57.533
you can be pretty sure he's got your back.

07:57.653 --> 08:00.231
Yeah. So, how have you been?

08:00.267 --> 08:02.143
Great. I just got my commerce degree,

08:02.170 --> 08:04.777
which I plan on putting to
good use over at Briar Ridge.

08:04.897 --> 08:07.439
So if you're looking for a job,
you can always come work for me?

08:07.483 --> 08:09.213
Yeah, see, I don't think you can afford me.

08:09.232 --> 08:11.353
My last boss was an
actual prince, you know.

08:11.399 --> 08:13.722
So I heard.

08:14.122 --> 08:15.387
But think about it, all right?

08:15.414 --> 08:17.682
I mean, with your talent
and my financial background,

08:17.700 --> 08:19.160
we could really make this happen.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.730
Yeah, I'll think about it.

08:21.743 --> 08:24.880
- Good to see you.
- You too.

08:25.356 --> 08:27.501
- Take care, okay?
- Okay.

08:37.107 --> 08:38.544
You're not even gonna look at it?

08:40.208 --> 08:43.428
Don't have to. I already know what it says.

08:44.114 --> 08:45.889
You gonna give me a hint?

08:45.987 --> 08:48.624
Okay. It's from the AG society.

08:48.643 --> 08:50.991
Turns out we're a wee bit behind
on the boarding for the horses.

08:51.025 --> 08:52.411
How far behind?

08:52.531 --> 08:53.939
About all the way.

08:53.975 --> 08:56.088
What're you talking about?
I just gave you five grand!

08:56.124 --> 08:58.513
Okay, if we don't get these
horses trained and sold fast,

08:58.633 --> 09:00.633
then the food bill, the vet bill

09:00.679 --> 09:01.995
and the stable fees are gonna kill us.

09:02.370 --> 09:05.059
So right now, we just need
to conserve our resources

09:05.179 --> 09:07.929
- and stay the course.
- Are you nuts?

09:08.209 --> 09:10.543
If we don't pay our bills,
we're gonna go into more debt.

09:10.578 --> 09:12.283
Okay. Then what would you suggest?

09:12.310 --> 09:13.874
We sell them now, before we're in so deep

09:13.902 --> 09:15.762
- We can't get out.
- Whoa, whoa.

09:15.882 --> 09:18.438
We're already taking
enough crap from Tim, yeah?

09:18.484 --> 09:20.734
Think what it'll be like
if we can't make this work.

09:20.854 --> 09:22.746
I'm planning on marrying into this family,

09:22.773 --> 09:25.142
so taking crap from Tim
comes with the territory.

09:27.265 --> 09:29.890
So how did it go today
with Caleb and the horses?

09:30.431 --> 09:33.032
Uh, we had some challenges.

09:33.066 --> 09:35.022
We spent most of the afternoon
dealing with this one horse

09:35.035 --> 09:36.897
that was always throwing Caleb
off whenever he roped a steer.

09:36.915 --> 09:38.470
Oh, hold on a second.

09:38.505 --> 09:40.043
You might be going about this backwards

09:40.073 --> 09:42.856
because roping a steer
should be the very last step.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.019
I know, but the thing is,

09:45.037 --> 09:47.607
we don't really have the time or
the money to train them properly,

09:47.634 --> 09:49.454
so I've been trying to
convince Caleb to sell them now.

09:49.473 --> 09:52.455
No, Ty, you cannot sell them,
not before you've trained them.

09:52.575 --> 09:53.852
You'll lose money,

09:53.886 --> 09:56.095
and dad'll never stop
saying "I told you so."

09:56.452 --> 09:58.948
I don't really think we have
any other option, Amy. So...

09:59.068 --> 10:01.363
Well, sure you do. I've got plenty of time

10:01.394 --> 10:04.043
and I happen to know a
thing or two about horses.

10:04.163 --> 10:06.540
- Grandpa!
- Hi!

10:07.153 --> 10:08.700
Hey, everybody.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.242
Hope you don't mind me
dropping by uninvited?

10:11.288 --> 10:13.452
Like always. Of course not, dad.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.010
Where's Jack?

10:15.056 --> 10:16.583
Dining at his new bride's house.

10:18.989 --> 10:20.545
And what about Peter?

10:20.579 --> 10:22.309
He ever coming back from Vancouver?

10:22.319 --> 10:26.956
Yes. But it's not just Vancouver,
it's Fort Mac, Houston...

10:26.984 --> 10:28.493
Wow, the grand tour.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.555
Well, it's not a pleasure cruise.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.194
It's business. He does what he has to do.

10:33.213 --> 10:35.014
Yeah, well, don't we all.

10:35.227 --> 10:36.871
Speaking of which, Amy,

10:36.991 --> 10:39.514
I bought a couple of racehorses
at bargain basement prices.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.188
I'd love you to turn
them into jumpers for me.

10:41.234 --> 10:42.240
Yeah, for sure.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.517
Uh, I've got a few other
things going on right now,

10:44.563 --> 10:45.460
but maybe in a few days?

10:45.469 --> 10:47.288
Okay, yeah, no rush.

10:47.526 --> 10:49.575
And how's the prince?

10:49.941 --> 10:53.554
Uh, well, I'm still on contract with him,

10:53.674 --> 10:56.571
um, but I'm m... mostly
doing my own stuff right now.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.063
The relationship.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.779
It's good, dad. The relationship is great.

11:00.818 --> 11:02.124
There you go. That's important.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.484
Um, may I be excused?

11:15.910 --> 11:18.490
Have you noticed anything
different about Georgie lately?

11:18.535 --> 11:20.493
Yeah. Yeah, she does seem...

11:20.520 --> 11:22.020
- Kinda stressed.
- Yeah.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.703
Maybe there's something going on at school?

11:23.749 --> 11:26.676
Nope. I think there's
something going on at home.

11:27.911 --> 11:29.923
Look, she has been tossed around

11:29.946 --> 11:32.356
between different foster homes and families

11:32.365 --> 11:33.649
for most of her life

11:33.683 --> 11:35.448
and I think she was finally starting to get

11:35.475 --> 11:38.027
that this is the real deal, you know?

11:38.045 --> 11:40.256
That we are the family she never had.

11:40.290 --> 11:43.425
But now, I think she feels
like it's all falling apart.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.453
Because Peter's always in Vancouver?

11:45.573 --> 11:46.943
What?! No.

11:47.246 --> 11:49.258
Because grandpa and Lisa just snuck off

11:49.295 --> 11:50.969
and got married like they did.

11:51.005 --> 11:52.300
You know, Lou,

11:52.334 --> 11:55.039
it sounds a little more like
your problem than Georgie's.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.172
Okay, you know what?

11:57.206 --> 11:59.667
A wedding is not just
about two people, Amy.

11:59.787 --> 12:03.678
It is about sharing a milestone
event with friends and family.

12:03.883 --> 12:05.630
And... and grandpa and Lisa just...

12:05.676 --> 12:07.222
Didn't even think about us.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.850
And I don't know if we're
ever gonna get over that.

12:19.027 --> 12:21.152
So what do you think?

12:21.792 --> 12:24.865
I think that whoever broke these
horses did a lousy job of it.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.549
They're not balanced, they
don't respond to your leg.

12:27.554 --> 12:30.234
That one fights the bit and this
one's gonna need a lot more time.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.988
'Kay, well, what should we do?

12:33.015 --> 12:34.808
- We have to go back to basics...
- Back?

12:34.808 --> 12:36.930
No, there's no back. We have to go forward.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.485
In fact, we have to go full speed forward.

12:38.503 --> 12:40.231
Caleb, that's not how this works.

12:40.247 --> 12:41.905
Well, I'm on a really
tight schedule here, Amy.

12:41.951 --> 12:43.003
You tell that to them.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.805
You think they're gonna
care about your schedule?

12:44.841 --> 12:46.744
Look, I just need you
to get them on their feet

12:46.753 --> 12:48.061
and out of here as fast as possible.

12:48.106 --> 12:51.024
Caleb, I only know one
way to do this, okay?

12:51.051 --> 12:53.827
So if that doesn't work for
you then find someone else.

12:54.188 --> 12:55.743
Okay, um...

12:55.789 --> 12:57.243
I'm... I'm sorry. Just...

12:57.691 --> 13:00.966
Do what you need to do.
It'll work for me, too.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.804
Totally.

13:10.313 --> 13:11.420
Hey, um,

13:11.445 --> 13:13.295
Georgie, I'm gonna head
into town this afternoon,

13:13.295 --> 13:14.493
if you wanna come with.

13:17.081 --> 13:18.792
Georgie, are you okay?

13:19.285 --> 13:21.755
You know, ever since grandpa
announced his secret wedding,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.152
you've seemed sort of, I don't know...

13:24.272 --> 13:25.438
Out of sorts?

13:25.558 --> 13:28.597
I'm not out of sorts, whatever that means.

13:28.816 --> 13:32.237
Well, don't worry, because
you're not the only one.

13:32.698 --> 13:35.703
And I wish I knew how to fix this, but I...

13:36.234 --> 13:38.264
- I don't.
- Well...

13:38.384 --> 13:39.783
We could...

13:39.903 --> 13:41.337
Give them a wedding present.

13:41.365 --> 13:43.084
We didn't give them one
when they got married.

13:43.102 --> 13:45.343
Well, that's because they didn't
tell us they were getting married.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.226
Well then, why don't we have a wedding?

13:47.254 --> 13:50.016
That would be very nice, but
they already had a wedding.

13:50.044 --> 13:51.873
No, I meant like when we have speeches,

13:51.891 --> 13:52.861
and then have a dance.

13:52.981 --> 13:54.690
You mean a reception?

13:54.720 --> 13:56.272
Yeah. They didn't have one of those,

13:56.318 --> 13:58.155
and we could give them the gift.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.557
You know, that is not such a bad idea.

14:00.781 --> 14:02.519
But I thought you were mad at Jack?

14:02.528 --> 14:03.781
Oh, no, no, I am.

14:03.795 --> 14:07.403
But, you know, a nice party,
something we could all share...

14:08.033 --> 14:10.567
Georgie, I am... I am gonna
need your help with this.

14:10.797 --> 14:12.936
How about you are in charge of...

14:12.970 --> 14:15.370
Picking a nice wedding
present for grandpa and Lisa?

14:15.398 --> 14:17.630
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

14:17.909 --> 14:21.361
Okay, I'll admit it, I
have been a total bit...

14:21.956 --> 14:24.673
a little bit stressed lately.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.650
And I don't blame you guys.

14:26.684 --> 14:28.395
It's just...

14:28.515 --> 14:31.523
I feel like I did when I
found out that Mary Jane Sutka

14:31.542 --> 14:33.398
had this amazing twelfth birthday party

14:33.435 --> 14:34.478
and didn't invite me.

14:34.491 --> 14:37.267
Well, this is different.
There was no wedding party.

14:37.387 --> 14:39.142
Well, except your dad.

14:39.262 --> 14:40.931
That is no consolation, Lisa.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.926
But I'm not the only
one who feels left out.

14:43.953 --> 14:47.338
It's Amy, Ty, and Peter and Georgie.

14:47.594 --> 14:49.204
Especially Georgie.

14:49.562 --> 14:51.876
So we have to do something about that.

14:51.912 --> 14:54.811
Well, we're not getting married again, Lou.

14:54.845 --> 14:57.702
No, but we are prepared
to do whatever it takes.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.126
Well, I was talking to Georgie

15:00.246 --> 15:03.116
and she had mentioned how
nice it would be for everyone

15:03.162 --> 15:06.016
if we could... share in your happiness.

15:06.317 --> 15:08.083
So it got me thinking...

15:08.203 --> 15:11.202
That maybe we should
have a little... party.

15:11.322 --> 15:13.424
What type of party?

15:13.452 --> 15:16.452
Oh, you know, a few friends, beef on a bun,

15:16.488 --> 15:18.042
maybe a little music.

15:18.401 --> 15:22.149
Yeah, I like that idea. That
sounds really good to me.

15:22.158 --> 15:24.628
Well, it sounds like a wedding reception

15:24.646 --> 15:26.975
and we decided we didn't
want a wedding reception.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.853
Well, that was before we got married!

15:28.853 --> 15:30.831
And now we're married,
and it's out in the open,

15:30.854 --> 15:32.710
and we can do whatever we want.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.300
All right.

15:39.108 --> 15:40.002
Okay.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.563
Just make sure that you keep it small...

15:43.683 --> 15:46.490
- Yes.
- And not too fancy.

15:46.525 --> 15:49.230
No. Not... not big, not fancy...

15:49.247 --> 15:50.248
- Right.
- A party.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.664
And... and you know what?

15:51.682 --> 15:54.364
It won't be at all like
a wedding reception.

16:02.015 --> 16:03.744
Half an hour, Amy.

16:03.778 --> 16:05.803
You've been spinning that
rope for half an hour.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.892
Yeah, and he's still jumpy.
You wanna give it a try?

16:07.921 --> 16:09.713
No, I don't. I wanna do some actual work.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.099
And what is that supposed to mean?

16:11.117 --> 16:12.615
Put him in the box, chase a steer,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.271
see if you could actually rope something.

16:15.067 --> 16:17.942
Okay. All right, why
don't you give that a try?

16:17.988 --> 16:19.703
Because I've had just about enough of you

16:19.726 --> 16:20.839
telling me how to do my job.

16:20.844 --> 16:22.319
You let me know how it works out.

16:33.588 --> 16:34.700
Hi, Lou!

16:35.970 --> 16:39.471
- Planning a party?
- Val!

16:39.722 --> 16:40.882
Wow!

16:41.221 --> 16:43.077
I haven't seen you in years.

16:43.197 --> 16:44.216
How are you?

16:44.387 --> 16:45.435
I'm okay.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.586
Always loved a Heartland party.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.910
Party? It's no... no, it's nothing.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.134
It's just... it's a little get together.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.984
Well, that is too bad.

16:56.104 --> 16:57.547
I want to meet your new baby.

16:57.594 --> 16:59.438
Actually, she's almost four years old.

16:59.558 --> 17:01.900
Of course she is. Oh my goodness.

17:02.242 --> 17:04.906
And I understand that you've
taken a little orphan girl

17:04.935 --> 17:06.321
- under your wing?
- Georgie.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.680
Aw...

17:07.704 --> 17:08.851
And Jack?

17:09.115 --> 17:10.959
Gotta spend some time with Jack.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.861
We've got a lot to catch up on.

17:12.981 --> 17:15.016
I... I bet you do.

17:15.179 --> 17:18.314
But, um, look at the
time. I really have to run.

17:18.608 --> 17:20.406
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah!

17:20.992 --> 17:22.385
And, uh,

17:23.035 --> 17:24.212
we'll keep in touch.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.810
Okay.

17:31.161 --> 17:32.834
I just couldn't bring myself to tell her

17:32.846 --> 17:34.268
why we were having the party.

17:34.298 --> 17:36.621
I mean, that woman has been
carrying a torch for you

17:36.645 --> 17:37.891
ever since grandma died,

17:37.926 --> 17:40.456
so I don't think it should be my job

17:40.473 --> 17:41.539
to tell her the bad news.

17:41.571 --> 17:44.155
Well, just tell me that
you didn't invite her.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.688
Of course I didn't invite her!

17:45.700 --> 17:47.524
I got out of there as fast as I could.

17:47.971 --> 17:49.762
But since you created this situation...

17:49.774 --> 17:51.659
I didn't create the situation, you did.

17:51.677 --> 17:53.573
Grandpa, even if we weren't having a party,

17:53.583 --> 17:56.301
eventually you would have
to tell Val you married Lisa.

17:56.529 --> 17:58.116
So I'll leave it to you.

17:59.755 --> 18:02.015
So... how's it going?

18:02.272 --> 18:04.848
Great. You know, I've got a
feeling that today's the day

18:04.859 --> 18:06.200
I'm gonna make it over the wall.

18:06.721 --> 18:07.996
Well, that is great.

18:08.418 --> 18:09.536
Do you need a leg up?

18:09.656 --> 18:10.882
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:13.662 --> 18:14.836
Thanks.

18:35.223 --> 18:37.025
You almost had it there.

18:37.145 --> 18:39.321
We had the height,

18:39.330 --> 18:42.077
but my timing was off by just a fraction.

18:42.197 --> 18:43.665
So...

18:44.269 --> 18:46.007
What happened with Caleb?

18:46.127 --> 18:48.317
I tried, Ty. I really did.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.504
Amy, I got a lot of money
tied up in those horses.

18:50.817 --> 18:53.323
It's just wasn't working, okay?

18:53.543 --> 18:54.997
Look... I wasn't making any progress,

18:55.043 --> 18:56.991
and Caleb was driving me nuts.

18:57.111 --> 18:58.720
Okay, well,

18:58.840 --> 19:01.444
maybe you need to look at it
like you're looking at this wall.

19:01.646 --> 19:04.152
You know, you try, you don't make it over,

19:04.418 --> 19:06.553
you pick up the bricks, you put them back,

19:06.673 --> 19:08.808
and eventually...

19:11.024 --> 19:12.625
You're gonna make it over.

19:12.659 --> 19:16.372
Okay. Except this is a
wall made of foam bricks.

19:16.492 --> 19:18.898
- We're talking about Caleb.
- I know.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.183
But he's my partner, Amy,

19:23.457 --> 19:26.485
and I really need a commitment this.

19:30.216 --> 19:32.091
So,

19:32.320 --> 19:34.634
I heard your run into Lou...

19:34.754 --> 19:37.460
- Yesterday.
- Yes I did.

19:37.570 --> 19:41.512
And, uh, if this is about the
party, I'd love to drop by.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.531
Well, it's not really a
party, Val. That's the thing.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.466
It's... it's uh... more like a...

19:47.485 --> 19:50.256
You know, little family
get together is all.

19:50.283 --> 19:52.176
Ah...

19:53.185 --> 19:56.274
I used to feel like I
was part of your family.

19:57.866 --> 19:59.887
We sure have been through a lot together,

20:00.007 --> 20:03.428
- good times and bad, huh?
- Yeah, we sure have.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.156
But you see,

20:05.276 --> 20:07.900
um... this is different...

20:08.677 --> 20:10.333
Because

20:10.689 --> 20:11.842
um...

20:12.043 --> 20:15.788
- Lisa and I...
- W... what? Lisa Stillman?

20:16.131 --> 20:18.675
Is she still around?

20:18.795 --> 20:21.647
Well, yeah. Um...

20:22.347 --> 20:26.796
And I know that you and her,
you never got on that well...

20:26.916 --> 20:30.051
Oh, Jack, I don't care
if she's at the party.

20:30.344 --> 20:32.137
I'm just in town for a few days

20:32.164 --> 20:34.323
and I'd love to spend some time with you.

20:35.183 --> 20:39.029
And this is kind of important to me...

20:39.063 --> 20:42.663
Because I uh... I'm not
in remission anymore.

20:42.691 --> 20:45.572
I've got my cancer back.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.862
Jeez, Val,

20:51.042 --> 20:53.685
I'm sorry. I, I...

20:55.446 --> 20:58.999
Boy, what do you say? I
never know what to say.

20:59.978 --> 21:02.749
I know. It's déjà vu, huh?

21:07.121 --> 21:08.749
Wow.

21:08.959 --> 21:10.944
Anything I can do.

21:13.871 --> 21:17.603
I mean anything at all,
Val, you know I'll be there.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.898
Look, Lou, I found the "Hooves for Hope."

21:28.916 --> 21:31.020
You can adopt a horse in
trouble for Jack and Lisa.

21:31.047 --> 21:32.995
Oh, honey, I'm not sure that uh...

21:33.032 --> 21:35.364
Getting them a horse is such a good idea.

21:35.391 --> 21:36.974
Well, you don't actually get the horse.

21:37.001 --> 21:38.346
You just get a cute little stuffed toy.

21:38.466 --> 21:39.925
With every hundred dollar donation,

21:39.946 --> 21:41.647
you save a horse from
going to the slaughterhouse!

21:41.693 --> 21:44.620
Hmm. Well, it looks like a nice place.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.449
Yeah, and they don't just want your money.

21:46.451 --> 21:47.922
You can go and volunteer there, too.

21:47.949 --> 21:49.971
I tried calling them,
but their line was busy.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.521
Hmm.

21:54.114 --> 21:56.437
Come on. Good boy.

21:56.456 --> 21:58.029
Hey.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.123
- All right.
- What's Amy doing here?

22:00.142 --> 22:01.486
- Get up! Get up!
- She's just giving us a hand.

22:01.531 --> 22:03.389
Well, how much is she charging you?

22:03.509 --> 22:05.117
To tell you the truth,
we actually haven't had

22:05.163 --> 22:06.974
- a chance to discuss fees yet.
- Amy!

22:07.441 --> 22:10.011
I thought you were too
busy to work with my horses?

22:10.131 --> 22:12.215
Well, I am. I've got a
lot of work to do here.

22:12.252 --> 22:14.358
Yeah, I can see that, with Caleb's horses.

22:14.478 --> 22:16.385
Guess the price was right, huh?

22:16.386 --> 22:18.792
Like I said, we haven't had
a chance to talk about fees.

22:18.829 --> 22:20.475
Of course you haven't.

22:21.485 --> 22:23.668
Well, good luck, honey.

22:24.061 --> 22:26.832
She's gonna need it with
those over-priced cow ponies.

22:31.909 --> 22:35.411
Okay, so... even if I cross out
everyone I don't actually like,

22:35.531 --> 22:37.899
I still come up with thirty people.

22:38.019 --> 22:40.022
Yeah, and that's a gala for Jack.

22:40.049 --> 22:42.116
I know, I know. So...

22:43.735 --> 22:46.927
Oh, grandpa, how did Val take the news?

22:46.964 --> 22:49.332
Well, she didn't.

22:49.945 --> 22:52.213
I was just getting around to the subject

22:52.223 --> 22:55.177
when she told me that her cancer is back.

22:55.177 --> 22:56.284
Oh no.

22:56.318 --> 22:58.094
Says her doctors are optimistic.

22:58.113 --> 23:00.866
- She's got a positive attitude.
- Good.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.363
You invited her to come, didn't you?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.174
Yes, I did.

23:06.317 --> 23:08.485
- Tell her about us?
- No, I didn't.

23:08.485 --> 23:11.432
It just wasn't the right time, Lis.

23:11.466 --> 23:14.137
We are going to need a bigger party.

23:14.173 --> 23:16.369
Now why would we want that?

23:16.571 --> 23:18.272
Well, if...

23:18.306 --> 23:20.429
I mean, it would give you
a lot more people to talk to

23:20.429 --> 23:22.496
and you won't have to explain
everything to Val all night.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.307
Exactly.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.731
Okay.

23:27.298 --> 23:29.292
This changes everything.

23:29.316 --> 23:31.752
It certainly does.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.471
You know, it's like he holds
this huge grudge against you,

23:36.490 --> 23:38.172
and now that includes me.

23:38.437 --> 23:39.882
What did he say?

23:39.928 --> 23:41.583
I don't know, just like...

23:41.601 --> 23:44.715
Good luck, you're gonna need it, or
whatever, and then he walked away.

23:44.835 --> 23:47.391
I guess he's taking this competition thing

23:47.410 --> 23:48.800
a little too seriously.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.663
Well, whatever it is, someone
needs to tell him to back off...

23:52.024 --> 23:54.050
And I'm sort of thinking...

23:54.078 --> 23:56.092
That you are the best person for the job.

23:56.212 --> 23:58.092
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

23:58.129 --> 23:59.364
Why not you? He's your dad.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.320
Because you're the competition,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.257
and he's never gonna respect
you if you don't stand up to him.

24:04.636 --> 24:06.397
What, you're saying your
dad doesn't respect me?

24:06.517 --> 24:08.326
No, I'm not.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.649
I'm just saying that he'll respect you more

24:10.659 --> 24:11.720
if you do this for me.

24:12.140 --> 24:14.427
Hmm?

24:22.949 --> 24:26.342
So this "intimate" family
gathering is really happening, huh?

24:26.379 --> 24:27.687
Actually, it's getting a little bigger.

24:27.705 --> 24:30.019
But Georgie has a really interesting idea

24:30.056 --> 24:32.031
for a wedding present.

24:32.830 --> 24:36.332
They buy horses off the
meat truck and re-home them.

24:36.366 --> 24:38.734
She has her heart set on
adopting a horse for them.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.333
"Hooves for Hope." I've
never heard of it before.

24:41.361 --> 24:43.913
Really? It's local.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.410
Huh. You know, maybe before
we give them a cheque,

24:46.410 --> 24:47.663
I should drive over and take a look.

24:47.681 --> 24:49.428
You should take Georgie with you.

24:54.010 --> 24:55.208
Hey, Georgie?

25:01.611 --> 25:03.083
Lou tells me that you have a great idea

25:03.102 --> 25:04.492
for a wedding present.

25:04.839 --> 25:06.778
Yeah, I guess.

25:07.190 --> 25:10.099
See, I've never heard of
this "Hooves for Hope" place,

25:10.135 --> 25:11.946
so I was thinking of
taking a drive out there,

25:11.946 --> 25:13.071
checking it out.

25:13.382 --> 25:15.047
Do you want to come with me?

25:15.304 --> 25:17.791
Maybe later. I've got some stuff to do.

25:18.532 --> 25:20.041
That's too bad,

25:20.077 --> 25:22.355
'cause, you know, they
might let us see the horses,

25:22.475 --> 25:25.380
or maybe even pick one
for grandpa and Lisa.

25:34.530 --> 25:36.469
You here to help me?

25:38.106 --> 25:40.274
- Not exactly.
- Good.

25:40.511 --> 25:42.258
Grab that.

25:42.378 --> 25:45.121
Right here. Just...
I'm gonna cut these off.

25:45.322 --> 25:48.569
So I heard you bumped into
Amy at the rodeo grounds.

25:50.038 --> 25:52.210
Yeah.

25:52.330 --> 25:55.575
She was working for Caleb. How
come nobody tells me anything?

25:55.609 --> 25:58.100
Well, 'cause she's not working
for Caleb, she's working for me.

25:58.136 --> 25:59.546
Well, I don't see the difference there.

25:59.580 --> 26:01.914
The difference is Caleb's not
marrying your daughter, I am.

26:01.942 --> 26:03.725
Yeah, so you keep saying.

26:04.027 --> 26:05.783
Well, you can count on it, Tim,

26:05.820 --> 26:07.887
and that means I'm
gonna be your son-in-law.

26:07.922 --> 26:10.557
So why are you treating Amy
like she's working for the enemy?

26:11.015 --> 26:13.411
And Caleb, you're his role hero,

26:13.531 --> 26:15.469
national all around cowboy.

26:15.589 --> 26:16.987
Yeah.

26:17.344 --> 26:18.798
Four years running.

26:19.466 --> 26:21.150
I've heard,

26:21.270 --> 26:23.070
and so has everybody else.

26:24.735 --> 26:27.406
Tim, I gotta tell you straight, okay?

26:27.441 --> 26:29.793
You gotta get over it and
you gotta stop bugging us.

26:29.913 --> 26:31.631
You really wanna be my son-in-law,

26:31.658 --> 26:33.926
you gotta toughen up.
You think I'm hard on you?

26:34.046 --> 26:37.036
I'm cocktails on the beach compared
to what you're gonna run into

26:37.082 --> 26:37.841
in the horse business.

26:37.878 --> 26:39.835
I'm not talking about the horse business.

26:39.881 --> 26:41.753
I'm talking about Amy.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.612
You've seriously gotta
stop making her feel bad

26:43.640 --> 26:45.277
about working with us, Tim.

26:48.332 --> 26:49.612
All right.

26:51.149 --> 26:52.713
Yeah. What the hell.

26:54.506 --> 26:55.823
But don't be...

26:56.143 --> 26:57.707
Calling me dad.

26:58.759 --> 27:00.314
Don't worry about that.

27:00.351 --> 27:03.771
That's never gonna happen... pops.

27:12.643 --> 27:14.060
Why are we stopping?

27:14.180 --> 27:17.042
Because this is it, 66 Hawk's Head Road.

27:17.162 --> 27:18.817
What're you talking about?

27:19.320 --> 27:21.387
In the picture, there was a big white barn,

27:21.414 --> 27:22.347
and there's no horses.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.752
I know. This is what I was afraid of.

27:24.872 --> 27:27.644
Sometimes these Internet things,

27:27.764 --> 27:29.253
they aren't what they seem,

27:29.281 --> 27:31.568
and it looks like Hooves
for Hope might be a scam.

27:31.805 --> 27:33.799
You knew it was gonna be like this?

27:33.844 --> 27:36.753
No, I didn't know for sure.
I... I was trying to help.

27:36.873 --> 27:38.930
Well, I don't want your help ever again.

27:38.939 --> 27:41.280
Georgie, hold on. Isn't
it better to find out now,

27:41.299 --> 27:43.338
instead of after you've
already given them your money?

27:43.458 --> 27:45.259
Georgie, wait! What...

27:45.286 --> 27:47.344
I hate you! You ruin everything!

27:53.257 --> 27:55.970
Georgie, what is going on with you?

27:56.015 --> 27:57.150
Nothing!

27:57.628 --> 28:00.653
- It's a long walk.
- I don't care.

28:00.865 --> 28:02.829
Look, I'm serious. If you
don't get back in the truck now,

28:02.829 --> 28:03.772
I'm gonna leave you here.

28:03.892 --> 28:05.701
I wanna walk.

28:05.735 --> 28:09.159
Okay, fine. But I'm gonna warn you,

28:09.204 --> 28:12.040
at the pace you're going you're
not gonna make it home before dark.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.719
What do you mean, you can't make it?

28:26.747 --> 28:28.590
It's grandpa's wedding!

28:29.467 --> 28:30.835
Okay, so it's not a real wedding,

28:30.869 --> 28:32.143
but you still have to be there.

28:32.170 --> 28:35.189
Honey, he's your... grandfather-in-law.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.546
Yes, I appreciate that it is a big project

28:38.576 --> 28:40.357
and that your career depends on it, but...

28:41.492 --> 28:44.600
Georgie?

28:44.720 --> 28:46.484
Honey, I'm gonna have to call you back.

28:46.604 --> 28:49.905
Yes. Yeah. We'll talk later. Bye.

28:50.025 --> 28:52.221
What happened?

28:52.256 --> 28:54.259
There's no Hooves for Hope, Lou.

28:54.379 --> 28:57.423
It's all a fake, and
apparently, it's my fault.

29:02.554 --> 29:04.694
You know, you're not the
first person to get fooled

29:04.731 --> 29:06.743
by some scam website, honey.

29:07.467 --> 29:10.494
It's a good thing we were
as careful as we were.

29:10.974 --> 29:12.808
I know it was stupid,

29:12.928 --> 29:14.858
but I didn't think it
would just be more lies.

29:14.978 --> 29:16.941
More lies?

29:17.490 --> 29:20.616
You mean like the way that
grandpa lied about getting married?

29:20.975 --> 29:23.233
Well, that's why he wants
to have this party now.

29:23.270 --> 29:25.164
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

29:25.455 --> 29:27.588
Well, then, what is the problem?

29:28.502 --> 29:30.853
It's hard to explain.

29:31.777 --> 29:32.883
Try.

29:38.938 --> 29:41.262
You have to promise not to tell Amy.

29:41.637 --> 29:44.317
Okay, I promise. What is it?

29:46.420 --> 29:48.094
Okay,

29:48.332 --> 29:50.061
look at this.

29:58.186 --> 30:00.536
Oh, there's Amy.

30:09.469 --> 30:11.801
Oh my God!

30:20.160 --> 30:22.465
So good to see you.

30:24.294 --> 30:26.818
- Hi! How are you?
- Hey. Good.

30:26.837 --> 30:29.197
Pretty lady.

30:29.736 --> 30:31.877
You know, Lou, I think you were right,

30:31.997 --> 30:35.270
- this party was a really great idea.
- Yeah, I guess.

30:35.533 --> 30:38.882
- Is something wrong?
- No, of course not.

30:39.103 --> 30:42.028
Oh, look, here comes Ty.

30:42.339 --> 30:45.079
- Come on, Katie, let's go check on the food.
- Okay.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.585
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.649
Wow. You look amazing.

30:53.684 --> 30:55.835
So do you.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.066
Where's Caleb? I thought
he was coming with you?

30:58.186 --> 31:00.207
Oh, he's putting a little
extra time in with the horses

31:00.225 --> 31:01.149
but he should be here soon.

31:01.269 --> 31:02.336
I don't get it.

31:02.456 --> 31:04.894
Since you talked to my dad,
he's totally backed off.

31:04.929 --> 31:07.212
The work's going well, so why the rush?

31:07.248 --> 31:10.258
Well, it costs a fortune to board
six horses at the rodeo grounds.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.242
Well, then why don't
you just bring them here?

31:12.261 --> 31:14.008
You know, at little extra
feed isn't gonna kill us

31:14.037 --> 31:15.809
and that'll save me the trip every day.

31:16.394 --> 31:18.006
Working for free?

31:18.041 --> 31:19.632
Feeding the horses at your own expense?

31:19.660 --> 31:20.904
You might be good with horses,

31:20.944 --> 31:23.093
but as a businesswoman, you need some work.

31:23.213 --> 31:26.300
Yeah, I guess I do, don't I?

31:31.349 --> 31:34.861
So, uh, I think that
friend you invited is here.

31:36.159 --> 31:37.925
You should go talk to him.

31:38.045 --> 31:40.779
Okay, okay. But remember,
he's not my boyfriend!

31:40.807 --> 31:42.096
I know.

31:44.613 --> 31:46.689
- Hi!
- Hey.

31:46.809 --> 31:48.280
So I'm glad you could come.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.805
Me too. My mom drove me.

31:50.839 --> 31:52.206
Cool.

31:54.765 --> 31:56.366
Oh! Oh, look out, here comes trouble.

31:56.376 --> 31:58.607
- Jack!
- Hi.

31:59.357 --> 32:01.232
- And Lisa.
- Hi.

32:01.251 --> 32:03.684
I'm uh... I'm glad you could make it, Val.

32:03.718 --> 32:06.187
Look at you! The perfect couple.

32:06.221 --> 32:10.013
Yeah. I guess I forgot to mention that...

32:10.041 --> 32:11.458
You two are married?

32:14.329 --> 32:16.305
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you,

32:16.331 --> 32:18.601
but it never seemed like the right time.

32:18.721 --> 32:20.233
Val?

32:25.139 --> 32:27.341
Did you know all along?

32:27.375 --> 32:30.180
Oh, please, Jack.

32:30.211 --> 32:31.991
Everybody in town told me a least once.

32:32.019 --> 32:33.537
Some people told me twice.

32:33.555 --> 32:35.916
But then why didn't you say something?

32:36.036 --> 32:38.084
Because it was so much fun

32:38.120 --> 32:40.032
to watch you tie yourself into knots!

32:41.689 --> 32:45.501
And because it made me
happy to imagine that...

32:45.621 --> 32:48.391
You might care enough to try
to protect me from the truth.

32:48.437 --> 32:50.330
Of course I care.

32:52.366 --> 32:55.077
Don't you go get sentimental on me, Jack.

32:55.762 --> 32:57.701
We might've had our day,

32:58.030 --> 33:00.134
but it was a long time ago.

33:04.277 --> 33:06.481
Um, first of all,

33:06.482 --> 33:08.759
I just want to thank
everyone for coming out

33:08.781 --> 33:11.943
and helping us celebrate
Jack and Lisa's marriage...

33:11.952 --> 33:13.342
Even though it happened months ago.

33:14.921 --> 33:17.577
Seriously, we love you guys.

33:17.890 --> 33:19.725
So, let's get this party started.

33:19.759 --> 33:22.287
I would like invite my
daughter, Georgie, up.

33:22.315 --> 33:24.663
She has a special announcement to make.

33:24.697 --> 33:27.632
Come on, Georgie! Woo!

33:34.900 --> 33:37.799
Later tonight, if you look
up at the sky above the barn,

33:37.919 --> 33:40.378
you will see a big blurry blob of light

33:40.412 --> 33:42.628
called the Andromeda galaxy,

33:42.665 --> 33:47.499
also known as the M31, NGC224.

33:47.619 --> 33:49.505
In that galaxy,

33:49.533 --> 33:55.359
there's a star that used to
be called the HD Triple 2 155.

33:55.394 --> 33:58.228
But now, it's called
the Jack and Lisa star,

33:58.263 --> 34:00.389
so that, whenever Jack and Lisa are apart,

34:00.407 --> 34:02.328
they can both look up at the same star

34:02.333 --> 34:04.066
and know that they'll always be together.

34:06.571 --> 34:09.187
That is so sweet. How did they do that?

34:09.197 --> 34:11.043
Good job. Well...

34:11.164 --> 34:13.193
That is a pretty tough act to follow,

34:13.203 --> 34:15.453
but it's time for the best man's speech.

34:15.572 --> 34:18.096
So, dad, step on up.

34:19.532 --> 34:22.119
Come on, Tim! Let's hear it, Tim!

34:22.152 --> 34:24.186
Well, I have to be honest,

34:24.221 --> 34:27.024
when Jack asked me to be his best man,

34:27.681 --> 34:29.058
I thought it was a joke.

34:29.092 --> 34:31.724
He asked himself to be the best man!

34:31.728 --> 34:32.905
He kinda did.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.713
As all of you know,

34:35.739 --> 34:39.306
Jack and I have a long
history of ups and downs.

34:39.904 --> 34:42.463
We first met at the high river rodeo.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.641
And even though I was
kicking his butt every day,

34:45.675 --> 34:48.289
Jack never held a grudge.

34:49.259 --> 34:53.357
In fact, when I told him that I
was going to marry his daughter,

34:54.083 --> 34:55.862
I could tell it was a big deal for him.

34:56.286 --> 34:59.932
But that was before
everything fell to pieces.

34:59.933 --> 35:02.585
It was a rough ride while I
was married to Jack's daughter

35:02.603 --> 35:05.695
and it was a rougher ride while I was
getting divorced from Jack's daughter,

35:05.713 --> 35:07.798
so I would have to say that, Jack,

35:07.835 --> 35:11.310
you've seen your share of
rough rides and heartbreak.

35:13.535 --> 35:16.404
Jack lost his wife, Lindy, way too soon,

35:16.439 --> 35:19.569
and then a few years later, he lost Marion.

35:19.875 --> 35:24.579
But I can say that marrying
Lisa is something that...

35:24.613 --> 35:26.948
Both Lindy and Marion
would have wanted for Jack.

35:26.983 --> 35:29.522
It's what we all want for Jack.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.113
Everybody says that Jack is
the rock of this family...

35:34.233 --> 35:36.371
just ask him...

35:36.491 --> 35:38.092
But I see it differently.

35:38.126 --> 35:40.966
Jack needs this family
to give him his strength,

35:40.972 --> 35:44.264
and we all know he couldn't do it alone.

35:44.299 --> 35:46.085
So that's why we're here,

35:46.205 --> 35:50.776
to help Lou, and Amy, and Georgie,

35:51.151 --> 35:55.020
and Katie celebrate...

35:55.779 --> 35:59.579
Celebrate this marriage
between Jack and Lisa,

35:59.614 --> 36:02.803
and most importantly,

36:02.923 --> 36:06.820
to welcome Lisa to the
family and into our hearts.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.977
To Jack and Lisa.

36:09.097 --> 36:11.932
- Jack and Lisa.
- To Jack and Lisa.

36:12.159 --> 36:14.045
Cheers! Wow!

36:31.412 --> 36:33.610
- I'll lead.
- Okay.

36:36.115 --> 36:38.065
Oh, look, there's Stephen.

36:38.101 --> 36:40.260
I think he wants to dance with you.

36:40.287 --> 36:41.677
No...

36:41.714 --> 36:43.543
Would you like to cut in?

36:43.589 --> 36:46.022
Uh, yeah. Sure.

36:46.031 --> 36:49.361
- Have fun!
-  Thanks.

36:52.452 --> 36:54.474
I was just...

36:54.594 --> 36:57.483
That thing you did with the
stars, that was pretty cool.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.029
Thanks. I uh...

36:59.149 --> 37:00.172
I found it on the Internet,

37:00.217 --> 37:02.440
when I was looking at my astronomy project.

37:11.283 --> 37:12.300
So,

37:12.420 --> 37:14.906
- have you thought about it yet?
- Thought about what?

37:15.026 --> 37:16.480
Most people,

37:16.498 --> 37:18.794
when you offer them a job
as trainer at Briar Ridge,

37:18.840 --> 37:19.754
they remember it.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.389
Oh. I didn't think you were serious!

37:22.434 --> 37:24.461
Okay, well, let's say I was.

37:24.495 --> 37:26.965
Let's say you could name
your own price. What then?

37:26.966 --> 37:29.435
That's a pretty great offer,

37:29.901 --> 37:32.569
but I think, either way, my answer is no.

37:32.603 --> 37:34.594
Well, that's too bad, Amy.

37:34.603 --> 37:36.372
It could've been a real sweet deal.

37:36.407 --> 37:38.692
Let me know if you change
your mind though, all right?

37:44.881 --> 37:50.233
One dance for old times' sake?

37:50.353 --> 37:52.321
I thought you'd never ask.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.328
Hey, Georgie,

38:01.448 --> 38:03.733
why aren't you dancing
with your friend Stephen?

38:03.853 --> 38:05.655
Well, I can't dance with him too much,

38:05.701 --> 38:07.128
or else everybody will
think he's my boyfriend,

38:07.164 --> 38:08.344
which he's not.

38:08.464 --> 38:10.850
Oh. Well, I'm not much of a dancer,

38:10.896 --> 38:13.118
but at least no one will
think I'm your boyfriend.

38:18.848 --> 38:21.569
Oopsy!

38:25.419 --> 38:28.089
- Hey, Lou.
- Oh, Amy.

38:28.124 --> 38:30.725
I didn't know you were in here.

38:31.127 --> 38:32.527
Is something wrong?

38:32.846 --> 38:34.767
No. Nothing.

38:34.887 --> 38:36.624
Just um...

38:36.744 --> 38:38.899
That was some speech dad gave.

38:38.933 --> 38:41.443
Yeah, at first I didn't know if
it was at a wedding or a funeral.

38:41.563 --> 38:43.666
Yeah, me too...

38:44.139 --> 38:47.425
By the way, I was thinking
we should give a donation

38:47.434 --> 38:48.943
to a real animal sanctuary,

38:48.989 --> 38:51.266
just so Georgie doesn't
think they're all fakes.

38:51.275 --> 38:52.108
Yeah.

38:52.135 --> 38:54.148
So if you have any suggestions?

38:54.182 --> 38:56.850
I doubt she's gonna take
any suggestions from me.

38:56.885 --> 38:59.589
Ever since our trip to "Hooves for Hope",

38:59.634 --> 39:01.765
she's kinda been giving
me the cold shoulder.

39:01.802 --> 39:04.555
She's... Just kinda going through some...

39:04.675 --> 39:06.796
Teenage stuff. Don't worry about it.

39:06.842 --> 39:08.241
Okay, Lou,

39:08.991 --> 39:11.964
- please explain what's going on?
- Nothing.

39:14.241 --> 39:16.481
Except...

39:17.497 --> 39:19.306
Have you talked to Ahmed lately?

39:19.701 --> 39:21.860
Where did that come from?

39:21.896 --> 39:24.256
I'm just curious because you
haven't really talked about him

39:24.274 --> 39:25.875
since you got home, and I...

39:26.122 --> 39:28.198
I'm wondering if you guys keep in touch?

39:28.318 --> 39:32.186
Um... there's been a
few emails, phone calls.

39:32.306 --> 39:34.281
What're you getting at?

39:34.654 --> 39:36.705
It's just there's...

39:36.825 --> 39:39.321
You know what? This isn't
really the right time.

39:39.367 --> 39:40.666
- Why don't we...
- Lou.

39:43.236 --> 39:45.678
Okay. What the heck.

39:45.798 --> 39:47.736
Come here, I have to show you something.

39:50.891 --> 39:54.120
- This is not what it looks like!
- I certainly hope not, Amy.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.772
Because it looks like Ahmed
either just proposed to you

39:56.809 --> 39:58.245
or propositioned you,

39:58.281 --> 40:00.568
and either way, you were well
on your way to saying yes.

40:00.595 --> 40:02.247
I didn't say yes to anything!

40:02.281 --> 40:05.160
They gave me a necklace
and I said thank you.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.861
And that was it! Nothing happened.

40:06.981 --> 40:08.253
He kissed you, Amy,

40:08.535 --> 40:10.529
and it was more than
just a peck on the cheek.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.599
Yeah,

40:11.719 --> 40:14.636
he kissed me. Once.

40:14.974 --> 40:17.295
But that whole time we were on the tour,

40:17.329 --> 40:20.431
he was polite, he was
formal, he was like he is.

40:20.466 --> 40:22.533
And he didn't do anything until that night.

40:22.568 --> 40:23.700
And then...

40:23.709 --> 40:25.621
Then I told him to back off,
that he had crossed a line,

40:25.621 --> 40:28.072
and he said he was sorry.
And it happened that fast.

40:28.319 --> 40:29.189
Honestly?

40:29.234 --> 40:31.887
Lou, it's just my luck that some jerk

40:31.905 --> 40:34.366
would be recording the
whole thing on his phone.

40:36.396 --> 40:39.323
Oh my God, Lou, you can't tell anyone!

40:39.443 --> 40:41.537
It might not be that simple, Amy.

40:41.657 --> 40:44.052
I mean, it's already out there.

40:46.009 --> 40:48.936
But I swear, I won't tell anybody.

40:53.747 --> 40:55.787
You know what, Lou?

40:55.823 --> 40:57.415
You were right.

40:57.461 --> 41:00.662
That was a wedding, it
feels much more real now.

41:00.700 --> 41:03.324
Shouldn't you two be on a
honeymoon someplace exotic?

41:05.205 --> 41:08.391
Not sure there's any place
I'd rather be right now.

41:09.510 --> 41:12.983
Only one thing I regret...

41:13.480 --> 41:15.974
I never danced with you at the party.

41:41.575 --> 41:42.940
Do you need a leg up?

41:42.975 --> 41:44.876
No, I'm fine.

42:48.689 --> 42:51.013
Yes! You did it!

42:55.135 --> 42:57.495
- Good boy.
- Way to go!
