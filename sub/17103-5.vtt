WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:07.241
( theme music playing )

02:22.843 --> 02:26.247
( door creaks )

02:27.348 --> 02:29.783
Ben:
HELLO?

03:08.656 --> 03:11.191
BELYAKOV?

03:17.665 --> 03:19.533
( roars )

03:19.633 --> 03:21.735
( gasps )

03:30.944 --> 03:32.880
BAD DREAM?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.883
- Man: I'LL TAKE TWO.
- Man Â£2: I'M GOOD.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.233
GOT IT?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.903
Fletch:
WHO DO YOU LIKE
IN THE FIGHT TONIGHT?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.538
WHAT FIGHT?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.140
WHERE THE HELL HAVE
YOU BEEN, MARS?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.242
BAER VS. LOUIS?

04:02.343 --> 04:04.545
IT'S THE SO-CALLED
FIGHT OF THE CENTURY.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.881
GOT THAT RIGHT!
JOE LOUIS IS GONNA TEAR
THAT FELLOW APART!

04:07.981 --> 04:10.217
DAMN, IF YOU DON'T GOT
THE CORNER ON STUPID.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.754
EASE UP THERE, FLETCH.
GIVE THE BOY A BREAK HERE.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.823
LOOK, WHAT THESE TWO
GREENHORNS NEED IS

04:15.923 --> 04:18.659
A LITTLE SCHOOLING
IN THE MANLY ARTS.
NOW LOOK, BOYS.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.329
LESSON ONE:
WHEN A WHITE FELLA

04:21.429 --> 04:24.031
GETS IN THE RING
WITH AN EIGHT BALL,

04:24.131 --> 04:26.367
THE EIGHT BALL'S
GOT NO CHANCE.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.703
YOU SEE, THEY CALL BOXING
"THE SWEET SCIENCE."

04:29.803 --> 04:32.340
AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR COLORED
JUST RUNS INTO TROUBLE.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.575
THAT'S JUST
THAT SCIENCE PART.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.445
YEAH, BUT JOE LOUIS
IS A BIG 'UN.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.280
HELL, I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S BIG AS AN OX,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.783
NO JAZZ-BO'S HALF
THE ATHLETE A WHITE MAN IS.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.284
HOW COME?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.620
WELL, BECAUSE
HE CAN'T THINK
ON HIS FEET.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.188
( chuckles )

04:48.288 --> 04:50.257
IT'S HIS ACHILLES' FOOT,
SO TO SPEAK.

04:50.358 --> 04:54.728
NOW, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU PUT ANY OF YOUR RAG MONEY
ON JOE LOUIS.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.531
- A COUPLE BUCKS.
- OH! ( guffawing )

04:57.631 --> 05:01.101
THAT IS A LESSON
HARD LEARNED,
MY FRIEND.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.472
FIGHT OF THE CENTURY,
JEEZ, MORE LIKE LOCK
OF THE CENTURY.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.106
LOOK,
I'LL TELL YOU BOTH WHAT,

05:06.206 --> 05:09.610
IF I WAS YOU,
I'D PUT EVERY JIT I GOT
ON MAX BAER.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.214
OH, TEARS GONNA FALL
LIKE RAIN TONIGHT
IN HARLEM.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.417
( laughing )

05:16.517 --> 05:19.319
MARK MY WORD.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.461
- Woman: MORNING.
- Man: HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

05:27.561 --> 05:31.365
OH, THAT COFFEE TASTES
LIKE PASSED WATER.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.333
IT TASTES FINE TO ME.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.268
WELL, YOU'RE
USED TO IT.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.605
YOU BEEN HERE LONGER
THAN ME.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.508
Lila:
SUGAR, IT ISN'T HOW LONG
YOU BEEN HERE THAT COUNTS.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.476
IT'S WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
BEFORE.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.579
FRENCH BEANS AND CHICORY,
NOW THAT'S COFFEE.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.115
YOU GET USED
TO THE FINER THINGS
IN LIFE, HONEY,

05:48.215 --> 05:49.783
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.786
Rita Sue:
HEARD FROM THE PROFESSOR?

05:52.886 --> 05:55.923
NOT A THING.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.826
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
SAMSON DID HIM IN,
DO YOU?

05:58.926 --> 06:00.227
I DO.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.329
AND I WILL SEE TO IT
THAT LITTLE SHRIMP

06:02.430 --> 06:04.231
PICKS A NUMBER
FOR WHAT HE DONE.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.766
AND YOU CAN STAKE ON IT.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.870
- MAYBE HE RUN OFF
WITH CATALINA.
- CATALINA?

06:09.970 --> 06:13.140
Rita Sue:
THAT LITTLE CHILI-PEPPER
DANCED THE KOOTCH IN LOVING?

06:13.240 --> 06:17.144
RUN RABBIT
THE SAME NIGHT AS LODZ.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.414
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A COINCIDENCE.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.684
IT'S TRAGIC.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.754
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SPIROCHETES
EAT YOUR BRAIN.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.022
EXCUSE ME.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.998
DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY
BUT...

06:39.166 --> 06:41.101
I'VE SEEN HER TOO.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.403
WHO?

06:45.038 --> 06:47.407
YOUR MAMA.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.880
MY MOTHER'S DEAD.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.562
- SOFIE.
- ( Sofie sniffing )

07:08.662 --> 07:10.531
HEY, SOFIE, WAIT.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.066
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- NOTHING.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.203
WHAT?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.541
RUTHIE SAYS
SHE SEEN MY MAMA.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.478
- I'LL GO SET HER STRAIGHT.
- NO, DON'T.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.214
NO, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.982
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.852
Sofie:
IT'S OKAY.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.091
WHEN DO YOU START POURING
THE FOUNDATION?

08:11.191 --> 08:14.261
SIX WEEKS
FROM TOMORROW.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.096
IF YOU WANT IT SOONER,

08:16.196 --> 08:18.799
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PUT ON A SECOND SHIFT.
- COST IS NO OBJECT.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.169
THIS IS THE LORD'S WORK
WE'RE DOING HERE,
MR. BOWLER.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.807
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL,
NORMAN?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.476
IS THIS THE RAMPED
ENTRANCE HERE?

08:29.577 --> 08:30.811
AT THE REAR OF THE TEMPLE?

08:30.911 --> 08:34.582
- YES, SIR, I BELIEVE SO.
- THERE IT IS.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.416
DO YOU SEE?

08:36.516 --> 08:40.320
THAT WAY YOU WON'T MISS
A SINGLE SERVICE.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.890
JUSTIN, I--

08:45.358 --> 08:47.427
GOOD MORNING, IRIS.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.730
MR. DOLAN.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.532
SORRY I'M LATE.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.702
GOT HELD UP ON THE ROAD.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.270
GOD ALMIGHTY,
IT'S BACKED UP FOR MILES!

08:57.370 --> 08:59.773
FOLKS IN JALOPIES,
ON FOOT...

08:59.873 --> 09:02.209
( whistles )
SWELL DESIGN.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.944
THANK YOU, TOMMY.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.880
IRIS, COULD YOU TAKE
MR. BOWLER OUTSIDE

09:06.980 --> 09:09.717
AND SHOW HIM WHERE
WOULD WE LIKE TO PLACE
THE FOUNTAIN?

09:09.817 --> 09:13.621
- OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.956
MR. BOWLER?

09:28.636 --> 09:31.204
DISTURBING NEWS?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.807
I'M AFRAID SO.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.644
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IRIS.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.721
HAWKINS,
WHERE YOU HEADED?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.690
THERE'S A FELLA
I NEED TO TALK TO.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.525
I SAW YOU AND SOFIE
THIS MORNING.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.895
GETTING KIND
OF CLOSE, HUH?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.296
YEAH, SO?

09:56.396 --> 10:00.600
LISTEN, KID,
SHE'S HURTING,
SHE'S LOOKING TO YOU.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.270
THINGS HAPPEN.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.305
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU SAYING?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.374
I'M SAYING
STAY AWAY FROM HER.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.510
I'M SAYING SHE DON'T
NEED THE GRIEF.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.681
I'M SAYING IT'S NONE
OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

10:15.515 --> 10:19.653
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT AIN'T.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.089
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT WHEREVER YOU'RE HEADED,

10:22.189 --> 10:24.624
IT'S LIKELY
TO BE A ONE-WAY TRIP.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.728
AND THAT LITTLE GIRL--

10:27.828 --> 10:30.998
SHE'S LOST ENOUGH
ALREADY.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.176
HAWKINS!

10:48.749 --> 10:51.018
( knocks at door )

10:51.118 --> 10:53.320
COME IN.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.402
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.573
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
HONEY.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.944
BESIDES
I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE SORRY.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.180
YOU MUST THINK
I'M TETCHED.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.583
MAYBE.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.319
SOFIE?

11:29.556 --> 11:31.925
I AIN'T CRAZY.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.996
CLOSE THE DOOR.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.333
PLEASE.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.578
YOU TOLD ME ONCE
YOU...

11:51.678 --> 11:54.281
YOU THOUGHT
YOUR MAMA HAD

11:54.381 --> 11:57.050
ONE FOOT IN THIS WORLD
AND ONE IN THE OTHER.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.452
UH-HUH.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.122
DID SHE EVER SEE
DEAD FOLKS?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.899
I'VE BEEN SEEING THEM.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.336
EVERY DAY.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.039
EVER SINCE
I GOT SNAKE-BIT.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.978
ROUSTIES I USED TO KNOW,
A COUPLE OF OTHERS.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.280
CARNIES.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.351
JUST GOING ABOUT
THEIR BUSINESS.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.822
YOU'VE SEEN MY MAMA?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.859
HER MOST OF ALL.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.528
HAS SHE TOLD YOU
WHAT SHE WANTS?

12:41.628 --> 12:44.497
WHY SHE KEEPS COMING BACK?
ANYTHING?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.066
NOTHING.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.069
NONE OF THEM SPEAK.
NOT A WORD.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.506
THEY'RE JUST...

12:53.606 --> 12:56.043
THERE.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.184
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.890
Tommy:
SHE DID IT, JUSTIN.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.558
THERE'S NO QUESTION.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.793
SHE BURNED DOWN
THE MISSION.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.029
SHE KILLED THOSE KIDS.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.099
- Justin: NO.
- INNOCENT PEOPLE
DON'T DRIVE OUT

13:19.199 --> 13:21.268
TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
TO BURN THEIR CLOTHES.

13:21.368 --> 13:25.038
IT HAD TO BE WHAT
SHE WAS WEARING THAT NIGHT.
NOTHING ELSE MAKES SENSE.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.479
( children laughing )

13:35.348 --> 13:38.018
I ALWAYS SAID
I'D FOLLOW THE TRUTH,

13:38.118 --> 13:40.620
NO MATTER WHERE IT LED.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.323
AND NOW HERE IT IS

13:43.423 --> 13:45.592
AT MY DOORSTEP.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.931
HELLO?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.821
Man:
ARE YOU LOST?

14:48.922 --> 14:52.125
I'M LOOKING FOR
A MR. GEDDES.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.398
I'M EVANDER GEDDES.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.436
DO YOU MAKE MASKS?

15:11.511 --> 15:15.015
( clock chiming )

15:18.952 --> 15:21.021
HEY, MISTER!

15:21.121 --> 15:22.822
Geddes:
I'LL BE JUST A MINUTE.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.359
I DON'T REALLY GOT
A LOT OF TIME.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.230
NONSENSE.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.700
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME
FOR HOT CIDER

15:33.800 --> 15:36.436
AND GOOD COMPANY.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.039
NOW...

15:39.139 --> 15:41.574
WHERE WERE WE?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.410
HENRY SCUDDER.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.711
OH, YES.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.080
HACK SCUDDER.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.915
WE HAD QUITE A TIME
TOGETHER

15:49.016 --> 15:51.518
IN THE OLD DAYS
AT HYDE & TELLER.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.886
YOU MADE A MASK...

15:53.987 --> 15:55.755
OF HIS FACE?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.590
INDEED I DID,
INDEED I DID.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.925
AND A FINE MASK IT WAS.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.361
EXQUISITE.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.365
YOU SEE,
YOUNG FRIEND,
SINCE MY RETIREMENT,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.400
I ONLY MAKE MASKS
OF CHILDREN.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.438
THOSE STILL CLOSE
TO WOMB TIME,

16:11.538 --> 16:16.609
THEIR SWEET LITTLE FACES
NOT YET RAVAGED BY
BROKEN DREAMS.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.281
HENRY SCUDDER WAS
A RARE EXCEPTION.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.052
IN FACT, HE'S THE ONLY ADULT
I'VE DONE IN YEARS.

16:25.152 --> 16:29.289
EVERY PORE, EVERY NUANCE

16:29.389 --> 16:32.325
PERFECTLY RENDERED.
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.561
I NEVER SEEN
NOTHING LIKE IT.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.997
AND I'D WAGER
YOU'RE NOT LIKELY
TO SEE ITS EQUAL AGAIN.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.234
I BET IT WAS EXPENSIVE.
COST A LOT?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.802
OH, YES.

16:42.902 --> 16:47.640
BUT WHAT PRICE CAN ONE
PLACE ON IMMORTALITY,
YOUNG FRIEND?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.676
WHO PAID FOR IT?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.011
WHY, HENRY DID,
OF COURSE.

16:52.112 --> 16:56.383
YOU MEAN HE PAID FOR IT
BEFORE HE DIED?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.618
( guffawing )

16:58.718 --> 17:00.153
WHAT?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.555
OH, MY YOUNG FRIEND, NO.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.792
IT WASN'T A DEATH-MASK
I MADE FOR HENRY.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.530
HE WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.388
DAMN IT.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.243
BEST RIDE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD,
KIDS!

17:56.343 --> 17:59.279
Boy:
THANKS, DAD.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.451
YOU HOLD ON
TIGHT NOW!

18:06.619 --> 18:09.989
YOU JUST LET THEM
KEEP RIDING AND RIDING,
OKAY, SLUGGER?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.724
YOU SURE?

18:11.824 --> 18:15.128
THEY'LL BE SPINNING AROUND
FOR A HALF-HOUR AT LEAST.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.530
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
THIS IS THEIR FIRST TIME UP,

18:17.630 --> 18:20.367
AND, WELL, I JUST WANT THEM
TO ALWAYS REMEMBER IT.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.435
YES, SIR.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.337
GOOD MAN.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.044
THERE GOES
ONE IN A MILLION.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.682
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
HAVING A DAD
LIKE THAT.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.884
COME ON.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.852
YOUR DAD LOVES YOU.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.290
SURE, HE LOVES ME.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.292
BUT NOT LIKE THAT.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.229
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.033
OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T
REALLY BLAME HIM.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.904
I MEAN,
LOOK AT ME.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.640
I'M NOT VERY LOVABLE.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.511
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.515
NOT TRUE AT ALL.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.887
DON'T TALK ABOUT YOURSELF
THAT WAY.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.058
OKAY.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.329
- IF YOU SAY SO.
- I SAY SO.

19:22.429 --> 19:26.233
- Sofie: JONESY!
- WHAT?

19:27.033 --> 19:28.835
WHERE'S BEN?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.704
- HELL, I DON'T KNOW.
- WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HIM?

19:31.804 --> 19:35.275
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE,
A DAMN BABYSITTER?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.295
Woman:
OH, MY WORD.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.702
Young man:
HEY, LOOK AT THAT!

20:05.738 --> 20:08.408
Dealer:
LAST DRAW.
PLACE YOUR BETS.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.421
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

20:21.521 --> 20:24.591
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.094
I'VE SUPPORTED YOU.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.062
I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING,

20:30.162 --> 20:32.665
EVEN THIS PLACE--
THE MONEY, THE TEMPLE.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.135
NONE OF IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FIRE.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.839
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.775
YOU NEEDED MARTYRS.
I GAVE THEM TO YOU.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.346
- I DID NOT ASK YOU--
- YOU NEVER ASK!

20:47.880 --> 20:50.049
YOU NEVER HAVE TO ASK.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.951
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
WHAT YOU WANT,

20:52.051 --> 20:55.322
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE
TO PAY THE PRICE.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.565
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.335
ALEXSEI?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.737
ALEXSEI, PLEASE?

21:12.238 --> 21:15.174
I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE FIRE.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.010
I'M NOT ONE
OF YOUR FOLLOWERS.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.679
IRIS--

21:19.779 --> 21:22.415
IF YOU HAD ANY INTENTION OF
FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THAT,

21:22.515 --> 21:25.017
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.925
IF YOU WANT ME
TO DO THIS...

21:34.226 --> 21:36.796
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.917
GO AHEAD, JUSTIN.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.619
ASK ME.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.822
ASK ME
TO TURN MYSELF IN.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.628
I CAN'T.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.433
ASK ME.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.047
Geddes:
LOVE OF MOTHER,

22:29.582 --> 22:32.452
IT'S A POWERFUL THING,
YOUNG FRIEND.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.222
EVEN THE HARD HEART

22:36.322 --> 22:39.692
BEARS A SOFT SPOT
FOR DEAR OLD MOM.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.729
IS THAT WHY
HE HAD YOU MAKE IT?

22:42.829 --> 22:43.763
YES.

22:43.863 --> 22:48.401
AND A UNIQUELY SUITABLE GIFT,
I MIGHT ADD.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.739
SHE'S BLIND, I'M TOLD.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.040
I KNOW THAT!

22:54.140 --> 22:59.546
LOOK,
I'M TRYING TO FIND
WHERE HE WENT TO.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.647
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.381
HE MUST'VE LEFT
SOMETHING,

23:02.482 --> 23:05.918
SOME WAY
FOR YOU TO REACH HIM
OR SEND THE MASK TO.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.888
I MAY HAVE AN ADDRESS.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.356
WHERE?

23:10.457 --> 23:12.592
I'VE GOT SOME OLD RECORDS
TUCKED AWAY SOMEWHERE.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.360
I'LL TAKE A LOOK LATER.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.163
NO, NOW!
TAKE A LOOK NOW.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.499
WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.834
I DON'T GET MANY VISITORS.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.437
LOOK, MISTER,
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME!

23:24.537 --> 23:27.674
PLEASE GO FIND
THAT ADDRESS!

23:29.776 --> 23:31.978
CERTAINLY.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.914
CERTAINLY.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.584
MAY I SAY

23:37.684 --> 23:42.054
YOU HAVE A MOST
INTERESTING FACE?

23:43.122 --> 23:45.057
STILL YOUTHFUL.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.563
SKIN SOFT
AND SUPPLE.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.167
THE ADDRESS.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.670
AND YET,
THERE'S THE STRONG BROW,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.972
THE CHEEKBONES,
THE DEEP-SET EYES

24:00.072 --> 24:03.810
OF A POWERFUL MAN
WHO WILL SOON EMERGE.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.246
I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING FOOLISH.

24:07.346 --> 24:10.116
I'LL GO LOOK NOW.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.352
Stumpy:
NO, TO THE LEFT.
TAKE IT TO THE LEFT.

24:46.452 --> 24:47.620
TO THE LEFT.
COME ON!

24:47.720 --> 24:50.189
TO YOUR LEFT,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

24:50.289 --> 24:53.726
- ( static )
- IS THAT-- TO THE LEFT,
YOU JACKASS!

24:53.826 --> 24:56.663
THERE'S TOO MUCH
DAMN STATIC.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.465
I GOT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR
LOUIS'S BIG OLE NOGGIN

24:59.566 --> 25:02.068
- WHEN IT SMACKS THE CANVAS!
- CAN IT, DREIFUSS.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.505
- YOU'RE WRECKING THE SUSPENSE!
- ( laughing )

25:11.310 --> 25:14.647
Man on radio:
Drink Moxie, the only
soft drink with...

25:14.747 --> 25:17.483
HEY!
OKAY, DON'T TOUCH IT.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.151
I'M GONNA GO CHECK IN
WITH THE WARDEN.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.988
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE THE BELL.
ALL RIGHT?

25:38.938 --> 25:41.240
THAT GAL'S
REALLY SOMETHING.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.876
YEAH, SHE SURELY IS.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.184
EVERYTHING GOOD?

25:53.519 --> 25:55.054
NOW THIS NEXT GUY,

25:55.154 --> 25:57.724
HE'S REALLY SOMETHING.

25:57.824 --> 26:01.861
HANDSOME TO THE CORE.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.130
FASCINATING
PERSONALITY.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.599
RAZOR-SHARP WIT.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.635
HE IS A...

26:08.735 --> 26:11.137
HE IS A REAL MAN'S MAN,

26:11.237 --> 26:13.139
YET SURPRISINGLY...

26:13.239 --> 26:15.207
( groans )

26:15.307 --> 26:16.676
TENDER.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.846
- SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL CATCH.
- OH, HE IS.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.514
HE IS.
HE SURELY IS.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.450
A REAL BIG SPENDER?

26:24.550 --> 26:26.686
GENEROUS TO A FAULT.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.520
MUST BE QUITE A LOVER.

26:28.621 --> 26:33.760
HE COULD TEACH CLARK GABLE
A THING OR TWO ABOUT
A THING OR TWO.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.862
HE'D BETTER GET
HIS TROUSERS OFF
IN A HURRY

26:35.962 --> 26:38.064
'CAUSE WE AIN'T GOT
ALL DAY!

26:48.074 --> 26:49.742
FELIX?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.911
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE?

26:52.011 --> 26:55.848
AW, JESUS, BABY,
NOT NOW.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.885
YOU CAN TELL ME.
IS IT MORE THAN
$100?

26:58.985 --> 27:01.120
LATER.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.092
$200?

27:06.192 --> 27:08.895
THREE?

27:08.995 --> 27:11.630
COME ON, BABY.
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.867
IT'S FOUR AND CHANGE.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.138
FELIX!

27:19.238 --> 27:20.639
JESUS. WHATEVER.

27:20.740 --> 27:24.744
IT'S JUST A GOD-AWFUL RUN
OF SHIT LUCK.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.214
HOW MUCH YOU GOT RIDING
ON THAT FIGHT?

27:28.314 --> 27:30.950
TONIGHT? NOTHING.
NOT A PLUGGED NICKEL.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.053
NO, I'M THROUGH WITH IT.
NO MORE GAMBLING.

27:34.153 --> 27:39.025
- YOU BETTER BE
TELLING ME THE TRUTH.
- I AM.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.360
GOD'S WITNESS.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.921
BABY, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.460
I SHOULD HAVE
MY HEAD EXAMINED.

28:22.568 --> 28:23.970
NOW, YOUAY
WHAT YOU OWE,

28:24.070 --> 28:26.372
AND THEN NEVER AGAIN.
YOU HEAR ME?

28:26.472 --> 28:28.307
LOUD AND CLEAR, ANGEL.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.010
NEVER AGAIN.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.872
Stroud:
QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.875
ALL THOSE KIDS
WITH THEIR LIFE
IN YOUR HANDS,

29:02.975 --> 29:05.211
TRUSTING YOU
NOTHING WILL
GO WRONG.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.546
GUESS I DON'T
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

29:07.646 --> 29:11.417
I GUESS YOU
HAD BETTER START.

29:11.517 --> 29:15.888
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT STANDS BETWEEN THEM
AND AN UNTIMELY DEATH.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.592
HASTINGS, NEBRASKA,
1908,

29:20.692 --> 29:22.361
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.931
A LITTLE GIRL
STARTED ROCKING
THE CARRIAGE

29:25.031 --> 29:26.866
WHEN IT REACHED
THE TOP.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.201
KIND OF LIKE THAT KID'S
DOING RIGHT NOW.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.604
- Boy: WHOO!
- LITTLE GIRL,
BEAUTIFUL CHILD,

29:32.704 --> 29:35.207
BLONDE HAIR,
BIG BLUE EYES.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.542
FLIPPED IT OVER.

29:36.642 --> 29:39.278
SHE MUST HAVE
FALLEN 40 FEET.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.081
LIKE A DOLL
IN A CRINOLINE DRESS.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.952
UNTIL SHE HIT
ONE OF THEM CROSSBARS.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.654
DAMN, WHAT A SIGHT.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.890
HER MAMA SCREAMING,
"BABY, BABY, BABY,"

29:50.990 --> 29:52.992
PICKING UP THE PIECES
OF THAT LITTLE CHILD

29:53.092 --> 29:55.727
AND TRYING TO PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER

29:55.828 --> 29:58.865
LIKE A PRECIOUS
HUMPTY DUMPTY.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.133
( children laughing )

30:03.069 --> 30:05.905
HEY THERE!
QUIT THAT ROCKING!

30:10.409 --> 30:11.878
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

30:11.978 --> 30:15.181
YOU GOT TO FELLA WORKING
FOR YOU NAME OF SCUDDER?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.717
CAN'T HELP YOU.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.420
CAN'T OR WON'T?

30:21.520 --> 30:25.157
YOU GONNA RIDE OR WHAT?

30:29.595 --> 30:32.031
YOU'RE A PRETTY TOUGH GUY.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.335
( whistling )

30:53.019 --> 30:55.154
( Geddes echoing )
ALWAYS CAREFUL.

30:55.254 --> 30:59.491
ACCURATELY RENDER
EACH PLANE AND CURVE.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.528
A FORM OF PERFECTION
THAT IS

31:02.628 --> 31:07.333
THE ADDITORY SUM
OF INDIVIDUAL IMPERFECTIONS.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.903
MY OBJECTIVE, YOU SEE,

31:11.003 --> 31:14.373
IS TO CAPTURE THE SOUL.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.649
IS TO CAPTURE THE SOUL.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.056
HEY.

31:30.156 --> 31:33.525
EASY, MY YOUNG FRIEND.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

31:36.362 --> 31:40.032
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
- MY WORKSHOP.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.870
( grunting )

31:44.971 --> 31:46.838
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

31:46.939 --> 31:50.509
SOMETHING... MAGICAL.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.816
THAT'S RIGHT,
KEEP STRUGGLING.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.887
PERSPIRATION OPENS UP
THE PORES.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.523
LISTEN.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.825
PLEASE.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.528
LISTEN.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.697
JUST LET ME GO.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.566
I WON'T GO TO THE POLICE,
I SWEAR.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.970
OH, I KNOW YOU
WON'T DO THAT.

32:18.070 --> 32:22.074
NO, NO ONE EVER GOES
TO THE POLICE.

32:29.681 --> 32:33.652
NOW, DON'T FRET,
YOUNG FRIEND.

32:33.752 --> 32:36.222
IT'S A SIMPLE PARALYTIC.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.859
I JUST NEED
TO HAVE YOU HOLD

32:40.959 --> 32:43.662
- PERFECTLY STILL.
- ( muffled screaming )

33:19.765 --> 33:22.101
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

33:26.072 --> 33:28.240
( plaster shatters )

33:30.242 --> 33:33.212
THAT WAS VERY FOOLISH!

33:34.413 --> 33:37.149
YOU COULD'VE
CUT YOURSELF,

33:37.249 --> 33:40.018
OR RAISED A BUMP.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.695
NOW.

33:50.996 --> 33:54.066
YOU'VE HEARD
OF PLASTER OF PARIS?

33:54.166 --> 33:58.770
WELL, THIS IS
PLASTER OF GENOA.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.040
A MUCH FINER
CASTING AGENT.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.210
OF COURSE, I--

34:04.310 --> 34:09.548
I DO ADD A FEW INGREDIENTS
OF MY OWN.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.783
BOILED LINSEED OIL,

34:11.883 --> 34:14.986
AND A TOUCH
OF BEESWAX,

34:15.087 --> 34:17.956
AND A TINY DOSE
OF PARAFFIN.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.393
A LITTLE BIT OF ALUM

34:21.493 --> 34:27.333
TO SPEED UP
THE SETTLING PROCESS.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.102
OH, IT'S LOVELY.

34:30.202 --> 34:34.273
YES, THAT IS...

34:34.373 --> 34:35.807
LOVELY.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.578
( muffled screaming )

34:41.046 --> 34:44.516
( gasping )

34:44.616 --> 34:47.719
- ( coughing )
- Geddes: AH, YOU'RE UP.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.821
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.823
YOU FELL ASLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.992
I DO HOPE YOU HAD
A NICE REST.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.862
Ben:
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

34:56.962 --> 34:59.465
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST--
I WAS HERE.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.267
I WAS PAINTING.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.137
HAVE YOU GOT
A WORKSHOP?

35:05.237 --> 35:08.374
A WHAT?

35:08.474 --> 35:11.143
- WHERE IS IT?
- I DON'T HAVE ONE!

35:14.446 --> 35:17.516
- I KNOW YOU GOT
A BASEMENT.
- NO.

35:17.616 --> 35:21.086
- WHAT'S UNDER THE HOUSE?
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.121
SHOW ME!
( panting )

35:23.222 --> 35:26.692
( chuckles )

35:26.792 --> 35:29.895
Geddes:
YOU SEE?
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.232
NOTHING.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.444
PERHAPS YOU HAD
A BAD DREAM.

35:48.180 --> 35:52.418
WELL, IT MUST'VE BEEN
A DOOZY.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.320
OH!

35:54.420 --> 35:58.857
I FOUND AN ADDRESS
FOR HENRY.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.697
THAT'S HIS MA'S ADDRESS.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.499
I ALREADY BEEN THERE.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.336
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE.

36:10.436 --> 36:13.939
SAY, WHY DON'T YOU
STAY FOR DINNER?

36:15.073 --> 36:16.775
I'M COOKING A BRISKET.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.211
NO. THANKS.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.813
I GOT TO GET BACK.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.325
( truck engine
starting )

37:00.018 --> 37:02.454
( music broadcast playing )

37:07.593 --> 37:11.129
Announcer:
Welcome to the Church
of the Air,

37:11.229 --> 37:16.735
an hour of faith
and hope featuring
our own Brother Justin.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.238
Justin's voice:
I won't lie to you,
brothers and sisters,

37:20.339 --> 37:22.308
when Eve ate the apple,

37:22.408 --> 37:26.778
man's fleeting hopes
for a life in eternal paradise
were crushed.

37:26.878 --> 37:32.351
As a result, we now live
in a world of pain
and despair.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.820
A WORLD OF PAIN
AND DESPAIR.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.223
Announcer 2:
There's a right
to the head!

37:38.324 --> 37:40.292
And a powerful left hook
to the body!

37:40.392 --> 37:42.728
Baer is driven
into the ropes!

37:42.828 --> 37:45.964
There's a right cross,
and another, and another!

37:46.064 --> 37:49.568
- AW, COME ON!
- Joe Louis is merciless
in his pursuit of Max Baer!

37:49.668 --> 37:51.837
Baer staggers back
into a neutral corner.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.806
The clown prince of boxing
seems out on his feet!

37:54.906 --> 37:57.643
Oh doctor, has he taken
a royal beating tonight!

37:57.743 --> 37:59.845
The Brown Bomber closes in,

37:59.945 --> 38:02.448
firing vicious combinations
to the head and body.

38:02.548 --> 38:06.017
Oh, there's a powerful right.
And Baer is down!

38:06.117 --> 38:08.119
- NO! COME ON!
- ( men shouting )

38:08.219 --> 38:10.489
- GET UP,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
- Five, six, seven...

38:10.589 --> 38:13.058
- eight, nine.
It's all over!
- ( bell rings )

38:13.158 --> 38:14.860
( hooting )

38:14.960 --> 38:17.796
In one of the most lopsided
fights in boxing history,

38:17.896 --> 38:20.966
big Joe Louis has
annihilated Max Baer

38:21.066 --> 38:25.170
in two minutes and 23 seconds
of the fourth round!

38:25.270 --> 38:27.238
What a night, folks!

38:27.339 --> 38:29.307
What a night!

38:31.910 --> 38:34.680
LOCK OF THE CENTURY.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.731
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR BETTING ON A HEBE.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.700
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

38:54.800 --> 38:58.003
- I'M JUST SAYING--
- MAX BAER AIN'T NO JEW!

38:58.103 --> 38:59.838
SURE HE IS.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.941
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.343
SHEENY TO THE CORE.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.347
SO, IT WEREN'T A--

39:09.448 --> 39:12.818
A WHITE MAN
FIGHTING A NIGRA.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.388
IT NEVER WAS.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.658
SON OF A BITCH!

39:21.326 --> 39:23.094
IT'S A GODDAMNED JEW.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.165
Roustie:
THIS WAY OUT, FOLKS.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.968
RIGHT THIS WAY.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.741
Woman:
I HAD THE BEST TIME.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.077
- GOOD NIGHT, FOLKS.
- GOOD NIGHT.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.017
Roustie:
THIS WAY, FOLKS,
THIS WAY OUT.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.621
Stroud:
MUST BE NICE.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.357
WHAT'S THAT?

39:52.458 --> 39:55.160
IT MUST BE NICE
BEING SO SMALL.

39:55.260 --> 40:00.165
EVERY MAN, WOMAN
AND HALF-GROWED TYKE
JUST TOWERING OVER YOU,

40:00.265 --> 40:04.169
WANTING TO PICK YOU UP
AND CUDDLE YOU JUST LIKE
A LITTLE BABY.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.506
( snorts )

40:07.606 --> 40:12.010
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
IT'S LIKE ALL RIGHT.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.614
SOMEONE ACTUALLY TOLD ME
YOU RUN THIS PLACE.

40:15.714 --> 40:18.984
- COULD THAT BE TRUE?
- COULD BE.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.119
DOES IT EVER
TIRE YOU OUT,

40:21.219 --> 40:23.722
DEALING WITH
ALL THE BIG FOLKS?

40:25.824 --> 40:28.860
SOMETIMES.
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.597
( laughing )

40:32.931 --> 40:35.333
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

40:35.433 --> 40:39.805
KNEE-HIGH TO A BEDBUG
AND ALL FULL OF SPUNK,

40:39.905 --> 40:41.673
HOW ABOUT THAT?

40:41.773 --> 40:45.844
YOU EVER TRAVEL
WITH A BOY NAME OF SCUDDER?

40:49.247 --> 40:50.982
NOT THAT I RECALL.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.718
NOW THAT IS CURIOUS.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.120
'CAUSE A FELLA DOWN
IN LOVING, NEW MEXICO,

40:55.220 --> 40:56.788
ONE OF THESE LODGE BOYS,

40:56.888 --> 40:59.525
HE TOLD ME
THIS SCUDDER BOY WAS
BUDDIES WITH A MIDGET,

40:59.625 --> 41:02.561
SO I FIGURE
HE'S GALLIVANTING
WITH A CARNY SHOW.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.129
NOT THIS ONE.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.598
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY'S BEEN TELLING ME.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.434
THEY BEEN GIVING ME
THE RUN-AROUND ALL DAY.

41:09.535 --> 41:12.337
AND THEN I SEE YOU,

41:12.437 --> 41:14.706
AND I GET TO THINKING,
"WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

41:14.806 --> 41:19.845
HOW MANY RUNTS LIKE YOU
COULD BE RUNNING DOWN THE SAME
ROAD THIS SCUDDER BOY'S ON?"

41:22.413 --> 41:24.716
- SCUDDER, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.719
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU OUT
WITH THAT.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.188
IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.658
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

41:33.892 --> 41:37.062
YOU MIGHT TRY
THE DAILY BROTHERS' SHOW.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.230
IT'S A FIRST-CLASS
OPERATION.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.600
HE PROBABLY WORKS
FOR THEM.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.336
AND THEY'S LOUSY
WITH MIDGETS.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.740
YOU'D BETTER COOPERATE,

OR I'M GONNA RUN YOU IN.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.543
( snorts )

41:51.643 --> 41:55.080
IF YOU'S A LAWMAN
I GUESS I'M JOHN DILLINGER.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.083
SAVE IT FOR HALLOWEEN.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.918
THIS CARNIVAL IS SHIT!

42:00.018 --> 42:03.922
IT'S NOTHING
BUT HALF-WITS, WHORES
AND TWO-BIT FREAKS.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.125
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T BURN IT
TO THE GROUND.

42:34.686 --> 42:37.455
Rita Sue:
YOU BET ON THAT DAMN FIGHT.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.591
WEEPING JESUS, WOMAN.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.927
WHY YOU ALWAYS GIVING ME
THE UP AND DOWN?

42:42.027 --> 42:44.896
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU DIDN'T!

42:47.465 --> 42:49.534
AS A MATTER OF FACT...

42:49.635 --> 42:52.170
I DID.

42:53.705 --> 42:54.940
ALL OF IT?

42:55.040 --> 42:57.142
YOU BET YOUR BRUNSWICK
ALL OF IT.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.745
YOU LOST EVERYTHING.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.683
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT LOSING?

43:06.517 --> 43:08.086
YOU BET ON JOE LOUIS?

43:08.186 --> 43:10.055
OF COURSE, I DID.
IT WAS A DEAD CERT.

43:10.155 --> 43:13.925
YOU PUT ALL THAT MONEY
ON A SHINE?

43:14.025 --> 43:16.662
WHAT DO I CARE
WHAT COLOR HE IS?

43:16.762 --> 43:21.466
WHAT, DO YOU THINK

43:21.566 --> 43:25.303
YOU SEE THAT--
THAT'S THE SHIT THERE.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.739
THAT'S WHAT I...

43:44.289 --> 43:44.355
THEY'RE CLOSED.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.259
YEAH,

43:48.359 --> 43:50.662
YOU WORK HERE?

43:51.629 --> 43:53.098

44:04.175 --> 44:07.979
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
COULDN'T FIND A DATE?

44:08.079 --> 44:11.049
I DON'T SEE A GAL
HANGING ON YOUR ARM.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.317
OOOOH...

44:12.417 --> 44:14.319
YOU GOT ME THERE.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.522
THAT YOU DID.

44:17.622 --> 44:20.091
I'VE HAD PLENTY OF WOMEN
IN MY DAY.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.628
ALL BACK-STABBING BITCHES
AND OUTHOUSE WHORES.

44:23.729 --> 44:26.297
I'LL TELL YOU, KID,

44:26.397 --> 44:28.800
THE MORE I KNOW WOMEN...

44:28.900 --> 44:31.269
THE MORE I LIKE DOGS.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.043
HEY!

44:40.779 --> 44:43.448
I TOLD YOU
THEY WERE CLOSED.

45:00.598 --> 45:02.167
HEY.

45:05.103 --> 45:07.172
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

45:19.084 --> 45:20.718
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

45:20.819 --> 45:23.688
JUST SOMETHING
I NEED TO TRY.

45:23.789 --> 45:26.091
YOU SEEM NERVOUS.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.229
CUT.

46:01.860 --> 46:04.229
THE TWO OF WANDS.

46:04.329 --> 46:07.232
HERE IS A LORD OVERLOOKING
HIS DOMINION,

46:07.332 --> 46:08.499
YET HE TURNS AWAY.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.837
ASHES, AGONY,
DISFIGUREMENT.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.179
( pig squeals )

46:21.279 --> 46:23.514
( panting )

46:23.614 --> 46:25.516
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN,
ISN'T IT?

46:31.622 --> 46:33.558
SHOULD I STOP?

46:33.658 --> 46:35.793
NO.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.329
KEEP GOING.

46:51.376 --> 46:52.777
( gasps )

46:52.878 --> 46:55.413
( explosion )

46:55.513 --> 46:57.148
( gasps )

47:03.721 --> 47:05.556
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

47:07.825 --> 47:10.161
NOTHING.

47:13.064 --> 47:15.200
IT'S THE LOVERS.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.969
ATTRACTION, PASSION,
TRIALS CONQUERED.

47:23.374 --> 47:25.210
( bays )

47:25.310 --> 47:28.279
- ( screams )
- ( blade zings )

47:31.049 --> 47:33.584
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR
WHAT IT MEANS?

47:35.486 --> 47:37.588
I THINK I KNOW.

47:52.270 --> 47:55.606
Apollonia:
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO READ THE CARDS.

48:07.152 --> 48:10.421
Iris:
I POURED THE GASOLINE
ON THE FLOOR.

48:10.521 --> 48:13.091
I LIT THE MATCH.

48:14.325 --> 48:18.263
I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I STOOD THERE.

48:20.265 --> 48:23.734
I JUST REMEMBER
THE MATCH...

48:23.834 --> 48:26.437
- ( Tommy sighs )
- BURNING MY FINGERS.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.977
AND THEN EVERYTHING
CAUGHT FIRE.

48:34.312 --> 48:36.247
I RAN.

48:39.150 --> 48:42.253
I WATCHED IT BURN
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

48:44.289 --> 48:48.659
I NEEDED
TO SEE IT HAPPEN...

48:51.262 --> 48:55.066
BUT I...

48:55.166 --> 48:58.269
I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR
THE SCREAMS.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.543
WHY?

49:08.879 --> 49:11.549
I FELL UNDER A SHADOW.

49:15.753 --> 49:18.089
IT PREYED UPON ME.

49:20.125 --> 49:23.628
- IT NEEDED TO BE DONE.
- Justin: THAT'S ENOUGH.

49:25.863 --> 49:28.133
DID YOU GET EVERYTHING?

49:31.569 --> 49:33.971
EVERYTHING.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.546
YOU'VE DONE
THE RIGHT THING,
IRINA.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.590
YOU ARE FORGIVEN.

50:12.077 --> 50:14.612
IS THAT WHAT YOU SEEN?

50:19.584 --> 50:21.052
I'VE BEEN THERE.

50:22.187 --> 50:25.156
RECKON THAT'S WHERE
SCUDDER IS?

50:26.724 --> 50:28.693
YEAH.

50:34.099 --> 50:36.434
I'LL TELL THE MAN.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.314
YOU GOT SOMEONE
ON YOUR TAIL.

50:49.414 --> 50:52.183
IS HE A BIG GUY
IN A BROWN SUIT?

50:53.351 --> 50:56.654
I THINK I HOOKED UP WITH HIM
WHEN I COME IN.

50:56.754 --> 50:59.090
A REAL PEACH THAT ONE.

50:59.190 --> 51:02.193
SMILES A LOT,
BUT HE GOT DEAD MAN'S EYES.

51:02.293 --> 51:03.928
WHO DO YOU RECKON
HE IS?

51:04.028 --> 51:07.132
- JOHNNY LAW.
- HIS TYPE'S MORE
COMFORTABLE BEHIND BARS

51:07.232 --> 51:09.800
THAN IN FRONT OF 'EM.

51:18.543 --> 51:22.079
I GOT A FEELING
HE'LL BE BACK THOUGH.

51:46.204 --> 51:47.872
- Jones: THERE YOU GO.
- Man: GOT IT?

51:47.972 --> 51:49.974
THAT'S GONNA DO IT.

51:50.074 --> 51:53.211
- ( chatter )
- STRAIGHT AHEAD.

51:54.712 --> 51:56.113
KEEP GOING.

51:58.483 --> 52:00.451
WE GOTTA GO!
GIVE IT TO ME.

52:00.551 --> 52:02.453
THAT'S IT.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.491
OKAY, SET HER DOWN.

52:06.591 --> 52:08.459
IT'S HEAVY.

52:23.574 --> 52:26.277
Woman:
THIS CAME
SPECIAL DELIVERY.

52:26.377 --> 52:29.146
- WHO'S IT FROM?
- THERE'S NO RETURN ADDRESS.

52:29.247 --> 52:31.316
THANK YOU, DINAH.

53:11.722 --> 53:14.359
( blows )

53:28.739 --> 53:32.410
HEY, KID!
PICK IT UP.
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY!

53:32.510 --> 53:36.080
Jones:
LET'S GO.
PUT THOSE BAGS OVER THERE.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.783
( heartbeat thumping )

53:47.425 --> 53:51.195
Jones:
COME ON, WE GOT A STORM COMING.
LET'S GET WITH IT. LET'S GO!

53:51.296 --> 53:53.130
BRING IT UP!

53:53.230 --> 53:56.567
THERE'S A BUNCH
OF POLES AND SIDING.

54:04.709 --> 54:07.312
LET'S GO, KID!
COME ON!

54:09.680 --> 54:11.849
COME ON!

54:15.386 --> 54:18.255
- ( gasping )
- ( plaster shatters )

54:53.257 --> 54:54.892
Jones:
GOD DAMN IT, HAWKINS.

54:54.992 --> 54:57.595
QUIT YOUR GAWKING.
MOVE!

55:33.130 --> 55:36.434
( theme music playing )
