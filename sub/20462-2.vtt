I'm never gonna be one,

I bet it's a pulled muscle.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.985
[gasps] Or... I heard about this thing

01:51.069 --> 01:53.238
where a spider crawled
into this dude's skin

01:53.321 --> 01:56.407
and laid a bunch of eggs there,
then died and then the eggs hatched,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.535
and there were, like,
a thousand dead spiders

01:58.618 --> 02:01.538
all up in this guy's skin.
Do you think it's that?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.582
I'm gonna kill you for even suggesting it.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.875
[laughs]

02:05.959 --> 02:10.338
Oh, Sophia. Aw.
I'm gonna love you no matter what.

02:10.421 --> 02:14.759
Even if one day a thousand dead spiders
trickle right out of your vag.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.138
-Does it hurt? [laughs]
-No! Only when you poke it.

02:18.221 --> 02:22.016
If you're not gonna listen, at least go
to the free clinic and get it checked out.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.769
No. No, I wouldn't be caught dead
in a place like that.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.354
Everything is free!

02:26.437 --> 02:29.232
I've gotten,
like, a thousand dental dams there.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.943
I use them to wrap up leftovers.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.737
-Here.
-Figures.

02:35.029 --> 02:39.576
Soon as I have an epiphany,
it's coupled with a swig of a shit soda.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.871
Okay, is that what this is? Your epiphany?
[gasps]

02:42.954 --> 02:44.664
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, that jacket.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.833
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh! [laughs]

02:47.417 --> 02:49.294
My life was garbage before this moment.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.920
Right? Oh...

02:58.469 --> 02:59.679

02:59.762 --> 03:02.348
No. Not after what he did to Britney.
No fucking way.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.268
[Sophia] I bought this for nine bucks.
Look how much it's going for.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.978
Sophia, you sneaky bitch.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.813
-Now, I can pay my rent.
-[laughs] Ooh!

03:08.897 --> 03:12.483
Oh, not only that,
but I can, like, live doing this forever.

03:12.567 --> 03:16.029
I mean, all from the comforts
of my small, shitty apartment.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.115
-I never have to get another job again.
-Nice.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.495
So, Dax wants us to go rollerblading,
but I don't wanna see him on rollerblades

03:24.579 --> 03:26.581
and I don't think
he wants to see me on them either.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
I mean, what's the upside to this?

03:28.374 --> 03:31.586
Annie, I'm in the middle of explaining
to you how my life is changing.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.338
Shit, you're right. Keep going.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.591
But can you remind us to come back
to the rollerblading thing?

03:36.674 --> 03:40.678
He's gonna be in shorts, and you know
how weird I am about men and their knees.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.723
Okay, so, my next step is,
I need to find more cool shit to sell

03:43.806 --> 03:45.725
and I don't wanna wait for auction money.

03:45.808 --> 03:49.562
So, I was up all night...
scrounging for cash.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
-How much you got?
-$21.64.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.399
-Not bad.
-Right away I found a 20

03:53.483 --> 03:56.569
in a pant pocket and took the rest
of the night to find the $1.64.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.489
So, if I can dig up
a couple more overlooked pieces,

03:59.572 --> 04:01.783
that's, like, $1,200 right there.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.577
Boom! Dollar, dollar bills, y'all.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.662

04:05.745 --> 04:08.915
Sophia, you found something
that you like doing,

04:08.998 --> 04:13.044
and you are actually doing it.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.422
Yep, I figured out life.
There's nothing left to learn.

Is the<i> Penny Saver </i>number five or six

10:47.521 --> 10:49.774
on the list of habits
of highly effective people?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.859
A, I'm not loving your attitude.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.944
B, I'm looking for estate sales. C--

10:54.028 --> 10:57.490
Babe, I know you are not alphabetizing me
right now.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.116
I didn't have a C anyway.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.576
[chuckles]

11:08.042 --> 11:09.126
[sighs]

11:09.210 --> 11:11.087
-Hey, girl, hey.
-Hey.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.756
Landlord don't like it
when I smoke in my place.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.758
So, you're gonna do it here?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.843
[exhales deeply]

11:18.094 --> 11:23.307
Child, I have been at airport security
all day long, looking people in the eyes.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.851
You only get a split second
to read their souls.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.978
Are they good? Are they evil?

11:28.354 --> 11:31.690
Am I really mankind's last line
of defense?

11:31.774 --> 11:34.693
And when I come home, I needs to smoke up

11:34.777 --> 11:37.446
so I can clear that shit out of my brain.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.906
Or else I go crazy.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.575
So, yeah, I'm gonna smoke here.

11:41.659 --> 11:45.996
Okay, fine. Just don't distract me.
I'm trying to focus.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.709
Okay. But you know how difficult it is
for me to keep my mouth shut.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.711
[exhales]

11:51.794 --> 11:54.463
These old ladies,
they don't wanna check nothing.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.965
One was coming from Napa

11:56.048 --> 11:59.009
with four bottles of Merlot
in her old lady purse.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.553
[chuckles]

12:04.181 --> 12:06.058
War hero. That sucks.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.978
Controversial opinion, but it's your home.

12:09.687 --> 12:10.855
Four bottles.

12:11.272 --> 12:15.109
So, I had to say to her, I said, "Look,
ma'am, you can't bring that on here.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.363
You're gonna either have to throw it out
or drink 'em up right here."

12:20.072 --> 12:22.533
So, goddamn it, she tried.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.327
[laughing]

12:25.411 --> 12:27.413
[children chattering]

12:29.415 --> 12:35.629
This other lady came on
with a baby in a dog carrier.

12:36.046 --> 12:40.009
I said, "No. Oh, hell, no!
Oh, no, you better don't!"

12:40.092 --> 12:42.970
Shh. No one cares about national security.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.723
Rita Wertheimer.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.436
Rita was a hairdresser
who got married to an investment banker...

12:52.563 --> 12:56.066
After that, she quit her job
and started focusing on fund-raising.

12:56.150 --> 13:00.029
Rita, a fixture in San Francisco
high society, never missed a party.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.199
He dies. She never remarries.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.160
No kids. Dead at 76?

13:06.577 --> 13:07.536
Ah!

13:08.037 --> 13:09.872
This bitch's closet runs deep.

13:10.539 --> 13:16.170
But a dog in a baby carrier,
that sounds cute and socially acceptable.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.213
Hmm.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.676
Ooh, I gotta go!

13:23.719 --> 13:25.513
Go get your man, girl!

13:25.721 --> 13:27.473
Romance lives.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.606
[tires squealing]

13:46.492 --> 13:48.327
[man] Why don't you have
a wonderful day.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.537
Master bedroom upstairs?

13:49.620 --> 13:53.165
Uh, yes, but keep in mind,
we have to shut down soon.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.084
Um, watch your step.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.169
[panting]

14:12.101 --> 14:13.102
[sighs]

14:14.728 --> 14:15.896
Oh!

14:16.313 --> 14:17.773
Is-- is that all that's left?

14:17.856 --> 14:20.985
Yes, they're not even my size,
but they're Chanel.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.152
I have to own them.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.365
You know, this is gonna sound so crazy,
but I left some Chanel in here earlier.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.784
You see a grown woman standing
in front of you, right?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.162
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
I could do better.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.833
Get your twiggy little arms off my Chanel!

14:35.916 --> 14:38.627
-[softly] All right, calm down.
-God, you fucking riffraff!

14:52.224 --> 14:53.225
[gasps]

15:01.775 --> 15:04.445
[groans] Holy... fuck.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.323
[groans]

15:07.406 --> 15:08.782
[moans]

15:09.116 --> 15:10.492
Oh, that hurt.

15:11.952 --> 15:15.748
Okay. Time to rest.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.253
Save a spot for me down there, Rita.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.014
Hey, you can't sleep in here.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.349
[Sophia grunts]

15:35.517 --> 15:37.019
How long have I been out?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.021
Hours?

15:40.022 --> 15:41.190
Days?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.192
What time is it?

15:43.692 --> 15:46.028
It's, uh, ten after three.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.738
Hm.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.156
A few minutes then.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.408
Are you okay?

15:53.369 --> 15:54.662
Yeah, I think so.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.081
I was just trying to open that trunk

15:57.164 --> 16:00.000
and a wave of pain
went through every inch of my body.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.710
You want me to call somebody?

16:04.254 --> 16:05.172
No.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.841
I want you to open that trunk.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.719
[grunting]

16:15.057 --> 16:17.559
Oh, thank God. It's just winter clothes.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.355
I once worked one of these sales
with a beautiful roll-top desk.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.232
I opened up a drawer. Full of teeth.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.150
-Gross.
-Yeah, it was a lot of teeth.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.485
More than several mouths.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.404
So, how much for all of this?

16:29.029 --> 16:32.783
Well, we never inventoried it,
so 20 bucks.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.744
I almost died. How about ten?

16:35.828 --> 16:36.787
Mm.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.080
Deal.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.791
[groans]

16:40.874 --> 16:42.626
Are you sure you're okay?

16:43.168 --> 16:47.047
Oh, yeah, I just have this, like,
weird bump near my razor burn area.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.425
Appeared out of nowhere.
I'm hoping it goes away.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.886
Yeah, zits go away on their own.
Everything else just really gets worse.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.472
-Never heard a grown man say "zits."
-I'm serious.

16:55.556 --> 16:59.143
One day, you're looking at a mole,
next day, stage three melanoma.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.311
-Hmm.
-Take it from Rita Wertheimer.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.815
-Rita died from skin cancer?
-No, she shot herself from loneliness.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.152
But through her charity, she raised
money for skin cancer awareness.

17:08.777 --> 17:12.406
So, go get that looked at. For Rita.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.706
My ear's bleeding!

17:21.915 --> 17:22.750
I'm sorry.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.588
As a result of an adulterous affair!

17:29.590 --> 17:31.759
I don't have much to say to you
about that.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.262
Okay!

17:36.055 --> 17:38.348
-[rock music playing on TV]
-[ringing]

17:39.349 --> 17:40.726
Sophia, where are you?

17:40.809 --> 17:44.271
Shane just got this new game.
He and Dax are totally shredding!

17:44.480 --> 17:48.358
Also, did I mention that Shane's here?

17:48.442 --> 17:52.071
Annie, I'm the one who called you.
That means I get to set the agenda.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.783
-Well, talk to me, girl. Set my agenda.
-Ask her when we're hanging out again.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.327
-I'm at the free clinic.
-You're at the free clinic?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.953
-Red flag, dude.
-I'm taking your advice

18:00.037 --> 18:01.663
and getting my snatch looked at.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.415
Can't hear you!

18:03.916 --> 18:05.292
Bleeding ear!

18:05.751 --> 18:08.003
[softly] Oh, boy. This place is awful.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.589
<i>Right now, I'm staring</i>
<i>at a </i>People<i> magazine from the '90s</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:12.216
with Tonya Harding on the cover.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.927
Her face is all red and puffy
from sick hands that have touched it.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.888
<i>-Oh, no, doll. That's just how she looked.</i>
-Harriet Connick Jr.?

18:17.971 --> 18:19.473
Oh, they just called for me.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.892
I'm just gonna call in sick,
and I'll come meet you.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.353
No, don't do that.
It's okay. I'm okay, really.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.773
All right. You are gonna be fine.
I know this, I'm very smart like that.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.359
-Ms. Connick Jr.?
-Yup, that's me.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.277
-I gotta go.
-<i>Love you in case I die.</i>

18:32.361 --> 18:34.113
Love you in case I die. For real.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.158
Yup, I feel it.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.911
-What is it?
-It appears to be an inguinal hernia.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.288
A hernia?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.457
I'm too young to have a hernia.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.002
Well, some people tell me I'm too young
to be a doctor, but here we are.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.880
I may not know everything,
but I know enough.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.300
Okay, so, what's an "inguinual hernia"?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.010
"Inguinal." Uh...

18:57.094 --> 19:00.222
Some tissue, most likely your intestine,
has protruded through the muscle wall.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.516
[clears throat] How did I get it?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.309
It can happen lots of different ways.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.355
Were you engaging in any kind
of unusual strenuous activity?

19:08.438 --> 19:12.151
Um... Oh, yeah. Well, this morning
I was celebrating because I kind of...

19:12.943 --> 19:14.987
figured out life.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.446
So, is it dangerous?

19:16.530 --> 19:19.324
Nah, some live with them for years
and never know they have them.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.745
But if tissue becomes strangulated,
meaning the blood flow to it gets cut off,

19:23.829 --> 19:26.456
it could become necrotic,
and that's potentially lethal.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.835
So, it could be the <i>most</i> dangerous?

19:29.918 --> 19:32.004
Just take it easy.
If it hurts, take an Advil.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.922
Okay, and then how do you fix it?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.215
Do you just pop it back in

19:35.299 --> 19:37.885
and then a bump grows on my head,
like <i>Tom and Jerry</i>?

19:37.968 --> 19:40.762
-Heh, right? If only.
-[chuckles]

19:40.846 --> 19:43.223
No, no, no, you'd have it done surgically.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.518
-How much does that cost?
-Hard to say.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.354
-I'd guess 3,000 to 5,000.
-[gasps]

19:49.438 --> 19:52.191
But if you have health insurance,
it'd just be your deductible.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.400
-Dude.
-Doctor.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.569
You think I would be here
if I had health insurance?

19:55.652 --> 19:58.530
After this, I'm gonna buy Advil
with an Albertsons rewards card.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.116
I wouldn't know where to begin
to get health insurance.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.118
Most people get it through their job.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.703
Christ!

20:05.495 --> 20:06.705
I need to get a job?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.792
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.756
[scoffs, chuckles]

20:19.176 --> 20:21.261
[grunts]

20:21.345 --> 20:24.973
-Everything okay?
-[grunts] No, it is not, sir!

20:25.307 --> 20:27.559
Thank you so much for asking.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.520
What?

20:34.566 --> 20:36.193
Failure to curb tires?

20:36.693 --> 20:39.488
This isn't even a fucking hill!

20:40.822 --> 20:41.823
[groans]

20:42.866 --> 20:43.700
What?

20:44.993 --> 20:46.119
Oh!

20:46.203 --> 20:49.248
Bitches! Nothing but bitches.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.876
Just keeping the woman down.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.586
[sighs]

21:15.107 --> 21:15.941
[Shane] Hey.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.529
Annie told me you're having my baby.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.239
[sighs]

21:22.322 --> 21:24.866
I thought that I was taking steps forward.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.121
Now, I don't even know
what direction forward is.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.664
We should go inside.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.499
Things are supposed to get better.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.044
There's really no guarantee
that that's true.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.632
For tons of people, their lives
just get worse and worse, and then...

21:41.800 --> 21:42.926
that's just it!

21:44.052 --> 21:47.681
They never figured out what they were put
on this goddamn planet to do.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.978
They just live, and then they die,
and they take a big old mud nap?

21:54.062 --> 21:59.693
And I'm standing out here in the rain,
literally with my guts hanging out,

21:59.776 --> 22:03.655
holding a dead woman's clothes
in a dirty laundry bag!

22:03.739 --> 22:05.741
[whimpers, breathes heavily]

22:07.701 --> 22:10.329
My life has got to be better than this.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.665
It just does...

22:16.752 --> 22:17.586
right?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.005
Right?

22:21.506 --> 22:22.632
[exhales deeply]

22:36.229 --> 22:37.147
[keys jangling]

22:46.323 --> 22:48.325
[slow piano music playing]
