00:49.549 --> 00:51.301
These cookies taste better.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.014
Hey,

00:56.973 --> 00:59.142
would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

01:07.358 --> 01:09.277
That guy you hang out with?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.614
You should know that he's a murderer.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.534
-What?
-His name's Sunato Banda.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.995
It was in the newspaper.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.208
Murdered four women, so,
that makes him a serial killer.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.669
And, you know, that's punishable by death.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.547
That's a filthy lie.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.799
No. It's true.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.468
Know what I think?

01:33.551 --> 01:35.845
I think he's the Jack of Hearts.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.808
There's only five of us left.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
Time is running out,

01:42.310 --> 01:44.729
so the Jack's gonna start
to get aggressive now.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.274
Might as well share symbols.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.990
For the moment, you're in a good position.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.327
The Jack still trusts you.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.664
So if anyone is going to lie to the Jack,

02:02.747 --> 02:03.915
it has to be you.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.209
Which means

02:07.085 --> 02:08.962
this game can only end one way.

02:09.712 --> 02:11.422
The key player here is you.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.722
I'm sure this is a lot,
and you don't trust me yet.

02:20.598 --> 02:24.060
For what it's worth,
there's no advantage for me to lie,

02:24.144 --> 02:26.354
so I'll tell you the truth
about your symbol.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.150
Don't you wanna make sure
that Banda's telling you the truth?

02:31.693 --> 02:34.946
What makes you think
that I would trust you over him?

02:35.738 --> 02:37.866
You don't have to if you don't want to.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.286
If I were in your shoes,
I'd want to weigh my options.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.706
And I've got no reason to lie to you.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.209
Banda's a murderer, and that's a fact.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.922
I still don't trust you.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.465
Fine.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.344
You'll see for yourself,
once the next round is over.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.931
You're a spade, just so you know.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.188
So, will you tell me mine?

03:12.525 --> 03:16.237
Come on. I told you what yours is.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.324
I never agreed to this deal.

03:26.998 --> 03:27.999
Heart.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.765
What's happening?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.733
I think the Jack of Hearts is…

03:54.901 --> 03:56.110
is that guy right there.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.116
I thought he was suspicious too.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.495
Well, don't worry.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.124
He'll die this round.
You can trust me on that.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.471
That kid Banda.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.768
He's the one we need to watch out for.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.692
You know that emo kid
who lied first to kill that big guy?

04:36.693 --> 04:39.320
Banda's the one
who convinced him to lie to the man.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.823
-I saw him do it.
-Huh?

04:43.866 --> 04:45.410
He whispered in his ear.

04:46.828 --> 04:52.333
Banda looks innocent, but he's got
no actual empathy for anyone else.

04:53.042 --> 04:56.587
He can only process human emotion
through logic and reason.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.718
He's certifiably psychopathic.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.432
He's the Jack of Hearts. I'm sure of it.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.094
There are only five of us left,

07:08.803 --> 07:10.972
and unfortunately, my partner's dead.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.352
I asked that guy Matsushita
what my symbol is,

07:16.436 --> 07:18.354
but he told me he doesn't trust me,

07:19.564 --> 07:22.024
and I'm pretty sure that he lied to me.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.651
Sort of a hunch, I guess.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.115
So, would you mind
telling me what my symbol is?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.659
I know this is kind of a big ask.

07:32.910 --> 07:36.914
But if you want, I promise to tell you
your symbol in exchange.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.001
I… don't mean to presume,

07:40.084 --> 07:43.421
but you strike me as an honest person,
at least from over here.

07:48.342 --> 07:52.722
Also, that Yaba guy strikes me
as a bit of a conman,

07:53.639 --> 07:56.434
and since you're aligned with him,
I thought you should know.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.992
Let me get right to the point.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.953
Are you the Jack of Hearts or not?

08:17.955 --> 08:19.749
I'll only say this.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.376
I might be the Jack of Hearts,

08:23.211 --> 08:26.297
but the fact that you're bringing it up
means it could be you.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.096
I know one thing.
You and I will never get along.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.600
<i>Your symbol</i>

08:38.768 --> 08:40.019
is a heart.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.147
Now, what about mine?

08:44.732 --> 08:46.234
It's a club, right?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.496
These taste better, you know.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.423
Five people left,
and only two pairs.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.883
The Jack's definitely going
to make a move this round.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.010
Yeah…

10:03.728 --> 10:07.773
I guess that this is the last round.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.626
Heart.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.468
Thank you very much.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.397
Diamond.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.910
Spade.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.340
All right, and now it's my turn.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.513
Spade.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.143
<i>It is time to answer.</i>

11:26.769 --> 11:30.815
<i>Please enter a solitary confinement</i>
<i>cell of your choosing.</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:46.372
I bet Matsushita lied to me.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.832
I'm sure he did.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.169
And Kotoko, she totally ignored me.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.966
Meaning that… it's a diamond,

11:57.049 --> 11:58.843
or a spade, right?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.346
Hmm.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.265
Ah, well…

12:05.683 --> 12:07.184
I'll go with my gut.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.288
<i>Please give your answer.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:16.754
I won.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.840
Huh!

13:37.983 --> 13:40.903
I had a feeling
you were the Jack of Hearts.

13:43.948 --> 13:44.782
But how did you…

13:44.865 --> 13:46.742
You teamed up with Banda from the start,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.245
and he's a murderer,
so it just made sense.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
We should be a team.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.544
<i>Even if somehow,</i>

13:57.127 --> 13:59.630
you were moved
by Banda's little monologue,

13:59.713 --> 14:01.590
I knew you wouldn't trust him.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.969
You don't trust strangers.
And certainly not as fast as that.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.099
Most people
won't even talk to a guy like me.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.976
But you wanted to kill me.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.064
I could sense that in you right away.

14:17.147 --> 14:20.526
So I wanted to see if you were smart,
or just stupid,

14:20.609 --> 14:22.570
or whether you were a true psychopath.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.738
You mean…

14:25.656 --> 14:28.367
You thought you were controlling me
this whole time.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.663
But I was manipulating you
into thinking that way.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.627
Ultimately, it was your huge
superiority complex that gave you away.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.631
That kind of self-importance
usually comes

14:42.715 --> 14:44.633
from being put in a special position.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.802
Something that made you feel untouchable.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.263
Like being chosen as the Jack.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.307
You guys are wrong about this.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.810
-Banda is the Jack of Hearts!
-Sorry, kid.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.941
It's not Banda.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.621
You and Kotoko were connected.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.041
I told Kotoko what her symbol was.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.210
And yet, she still died.

15:23.297 --> 15:28.552
Which means Kotoko was being manipulated
by someone other than me.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.805
Well, then,

15:32.598 --> 15:34.725
you should be accusing this guy instead.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.852
Every time I went to the cafeteria,

15:37.519 --> 15:41.982
you and Kotoko would always be there,
getting snacks at the same time.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.151
This break
couldn't come soon enough.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.236
-I don't…
-I'm scared. Aren't you?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.989
-When you trust…
-I don't know what's going on.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.075
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.618
You can trust me.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.454
Every time I get through it,
I think, "I made it."

15:56.205 --> 15:57.623
<i>And each time,</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:01.001
<i>you'd get the exact same kind of snack.</i>

16:08.592 --> 16:12.638
<i>You and Kotoko were secretly</i>
<i>communicating in the cafeteria.</i>

16:12.721 --> 16:13.681
Spade.

16:15.557 --> 16:19.812
Both of you were just pretending
that you were being controlled.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.698
<i>There were four different flavors</i>
<i>of the snack.</i>

16:32.157 --> 16:35.411
<i>You would confirm your symbols</i>
<i>by checking the packaging,</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:38.664
<i>using those snacks</i>
<i>as a code with each other.</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:40.332
<i>I caught on pretty quickly.</i>

16:56.682 --> 16:57.975
<i>And then,</i>

16:58.642 --> 17:01.478
you told Kotoko
to give me the wrong symbol.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.564
Diamond.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.902
<i>I really did trust her.</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:12.740
Except at the end.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.911
When did the three of you guys
start working together?

17:18.495 --> 17:21.123
Well, the very first announcement said

17:21.206 --> 17:24.251
that this game is about
how much we can trust one another.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.379
So we simply followed that principle.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.593
In order to gain someone's trust,
you can't

17:33.469 --> 17:36.805
control, or manipulate,
or guide them in any way.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.559
You can't brainwash or hypnotize them,

17:40.642 --> 17:42.853
lie to them or instill fear.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.399
It's called equality.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.991
I know one thing.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.951
You and I will never get along.

17:58.827 --> 17:59.912
Tell me.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.915
I want to know

18:03.957 --> 18:06.794
why you're here
playing the games in this country?

18:10.547 --> 18:12.841
I'll tell you why I'm here.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.719
I've never seen a place
more beautiful than this one.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.225
I'm here because I…

18:21.892 --> 18:25.854
because I believe that this world
is a place that is worth conquering.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.736
Well, then, you and I might be
more alike than you think.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.451
I'm starting
to get that feeling too.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.413
Trust is the most important thing
in this game.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.794
We'll be good for each other.

18:48.877 --> 18:52.339
Intellectual equals,
and trustworthy partners.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.765
Wait a sec.
What makes you so sure it's me?

19:01.849 --> 19:04.518
The Jack of Hearts
could easily be one of you guys.

19:04.601 --> 19:08.438
Okay, maybe I did try to blame everything
on you by setting you up, but look!

19:08.522 --> 19:09.898
But that's not enough, huh?

19:09.982 --> 19:13.110
You guys don't have any proof
that I'm the Jack of Hearts, huh?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.654
-You sure about that?
-Huh?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.115
Just think about it.

19:18.198 --> 19:22.870
If they suspected that you were the Jack,
then why did you survive this last round?

19:23.579 --> 19:26.582
Why didn't Banda lie?
Tell you the wrong thing?

19:26.665 --> 19:29.543
The reason you're still alive
is because you're the Jack.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.092
And these guys planned to keep you alive

19:38.218 --> 19:41.388
because they decided they wanna
get information out of you.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.530
<i>Round 14, start.</i>

20:02.784 --> 20:03.785
What are you doing?

20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
There have been so few opportunities

20:07.873 --> 20:10.542
to really get to talk
to the citizens of this place.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.587
We need you to tell us
the ins and outs of this country.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.845
I'm sorry that
we won't be able to kill you, but…

20:24.514 --> 20:26.725
there are a lot of other ways to have fun.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.447
We didn't get very much out of him.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.035
I can't believe he just gave up
like that and said the wrong answer,

21:27.828 --> 21:30.706
even though we told him
what the real answer was.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.085
He certainly gave up
faster than I expected.

21:35.168 --> 21:36.586
Hmm. Yeah.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.393
<i>My name is Kaito Kameyama.</i>

21:52.102 --> 21:53.895
-<i>Fireworks…</i>
-<i>I'll try to get out.</i>

21:55.105 --> 21:56.648
<i>It's lots of fun here.</i>

21:57.357 --> 22:01.445
<i>There are no laws,</i>
<i>so we can loot and kill as we please.</i>

22:02.487 --> 22:03.739
<i>When I play the games,</i>

22:04.239 --> 22:06.116
<i>It's like,"I don't fuckin' care!"</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:07.242
<i>Total freedom. Oh yeah!</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:10.037
<i>It feels pretty great.</i>

22:11.913 --> 22:13.332
<i>I hate it here.</i>

22:13.915 --> 22:16.835
<i>That's why I'm smoking weed…</i>

22:16.918 --> 22:20.422
<i>…and just flipping out!</i>

22:23.383 --> 22:25.010
<i>What is this world?</i>

22:26.511 --> 22:28.138
<i>What are these games?</i>

22:28.930 --> 22:30.682
<i>Who's behind all of this?</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:33.435
<i>You guys are fucking crazy.</i>

22:33.518 --> 22:34.686
<i>I'm gonna kill you!</i>

22:35.979 --> 22:38.732
<i>Hey! Stop filming and help me here!</i>

22:38.815 --> 22:40.525
<i>It's okay!</i>

22:40.609 --> 22:41.902
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

22:42.694 --> 22:44.863
<i>-Come here! I'm gonna kill you!</i>
<i>-Wait! Don't--</i>

22:44.946 --> 22:46.239
<i>-I'm gonna--</i>
<i>-Hey! Don't!</i>

22:52.204 --> 22:54.539
<i>Life is totally meaningless here.</i>

22:58.627 --> 23:00.504
<i>Human beings are worthless.</i>

23:02.589 --> 23:04.966
<i>Is that what this world</i>
<i>is trying to tell us?</i>

23:30.158 --> 23:32.077
Arisu. Do it.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.787
Do we go back where we came from?

23:33.870 --> 23:35.622
<i>Otherwise everyone will die!</i>

23:54.182 --> 23:55.016
There.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.685
Thank you.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.151
You know…

24:07.446 --> 24:10.073
when Kyuma and I were talking
at the end of the game,

24:12.033 --> 24:13.493
I figured something out.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.290
They were all players to begin with,

24:19.791 --> 24:21.168
and then eventually,

24:22.377 --> 24:24.588
they started making the games themselves.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.510
I mean that…

24:32.679 --> 24:34.306
we might not be able

24:35.223 --> 24:36.641
to ever get home…

24:39.186 --> 24:41.563
even if we beat every single game.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.318
Because…

24:48.653 --> 24:51.448
our world might not even exist anymore.

24:54.701 --> 24:55.827
Which means that…

24:57.871 --> 24:59.706
Tatta sacrificed himself

25:01.124 --> 25:02.501
for nothing.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.017
That might not be true.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.396
There might still be a way to get back.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.941
I'll keep trying.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.194
I'll keep playing the games.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.782
Tatta won't have died in vain.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.296
Are you really going?

25:49.005 --> 25:51.216
I'm worried
about Ann and Chishiya.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.552
I'm gonna go look for them.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.349
We need more friends if we're gonna
take down the King of Spades.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.227
And the more games that we beat,

26:03.144 --> 26:05.146
the closer we'll be to our goal.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.526
Don't worry.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.486
We'll see each other again.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.155
Usagi.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.950
You need to rest.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.622
Arisu. Take care of Usagi.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.712
Well, be safe.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.848
<i>You know,</i>

27:22.641 --> 27:25.018
<i>I'd be down with going</i>
<i>to a deserted island.</i>

27:28.480 --> 27:30.940
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.902
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies!

27:33.985 --> 27:36.488
Stop it with the zombie talk, will ya?

27:36.571 --> 27:39.699
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.077
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.495
I doubt that.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.580
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.998
Me? Why's that?

27:48.583 --> 27:50.627
Because I know you'd outsmart 'em.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.264
<i>What?</i>

28:04.683 --> 28:06.893
Why are you acting like your life is over?

28:07.977 --> 28:08.978
Huh?

28:10.146 --> 28:12.982
Why are you making that face?
You look like it's the end of the world.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.444
I was wondering what was on your mind.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.197
So fuckin' stupid.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.700
Is your life so pathetic

28:21.783 --> 28:24.244
that getting a job
will be the end of the world for you?

28:24.327 --> 28:25.578
Don't worry so much.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.288
Use your dad's connections.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.875
Just do whatever you have to do
and leave the deep thoughts for later.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.711
Arisu,

28:33.670 --> 28:36.923
sometimes life
seems like it's at a dead end,

28:37.006 --> 28:40.802
but there's always another path
you can take, even when things go wrong.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.888
Huh?

28:46.266 --> 28:50.520
Not really convincing coming from
a part-time bartender, though.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.106
Do you have anything smart
to add? I highly doubt it.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.899
Let me see…

28:55.650 --> 28:57.819
See, you got nothin'.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.488
-What you said was still really cool.
-Shut up.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.575
-Hard to do on the spot.
-Don't give me your shit.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.619
-See?
-Keep your mouth shut, then.

29:42.697 --> 29:43.573
Oh.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.494
Mugwort.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.233
Hey, do you wanna come hunting?

30:19.943 --> 30:22.111
We don't have any food left.

30:23.738 --> 30:25.240
I managed to pick this,

30:26.032 --> 30:28.034
but we won't survive on plants alone.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.337
Hey!

30:41.130 --> 30:44.008
If you wanna eat meat,
then you need to help.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.615
Arisu! Get it!

31:29.846 --> 31:32.265
Arisu, would you get serious about this?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.561
We don't have food for tonight.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.071
Arisu, look! Over there!

31:52.535 --> 31:53.411
Ah!

32:00.168 --> 32:01.336
It's there! Look, look!

32:07.425 --> 32:08.801
Ah! Aah!

32:09.302 --> 32:10.178
Uh…

32:11.930 --> 32:13.222
Oh, there's one.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.192
Ah, you were so close!

32:24.275 --> 32:26.402
You're terrible at this, you know?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.991
Shit.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.368
Huh.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.246
-What?
-Over there!

32:37.330 --> 32:38.706
This way? Oh!

32:39.415 --> 32:40.833
-Usagi, it's there!
-Huh?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.127
Ah!

32:43.753 --> 32:44.754
Arisu!

32:45.338 --> 32:46.381
Oh, shoot!

32:46.965 --> 32:49.217
Arisu, there it is.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.307
Ah!

32:56.391 --> 32:58.184
Oh, man. I give up.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.937
Damn it.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.147
No meat for you, I guess, huh?

33:04.440 --> 33:05.984
Oh, I'm starving.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.909
Come on.

35:03.684 --> 35:04.894
Are you okay?

35:09.190 --> 35:10.483
Film…

35:11.484 --> 35:13.319
-Huh?
-What film?

35:31.921 --> 35:34.006
In here?

35:58.823 --> 36:00.908
He must have been a photographer.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.291
This is eight millimeter film.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.712
Do you watch it with this?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.130
<i>My name is Kaito Kameyama.</i>

36:57.089 --> 36:59.717
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>electronic devices don't work here.</i>

37:00.676 --> 37:04.472
<i>So I'm using this eight millimeter camera</i>
<i>to make a record of this place.</i>

37:04.555 --> 37:05.723
<i>To document it.</i>

37:07.183 --> 37:08.768
<i>To figure out what's going on.</i>

37:13.022 --> 37:14.357
<i>Lots of fun here.</i>

37:15.107 --> 37:16.734
<i>There are no laws,</i>

37:16.817 --> 37:19.362
<i>so we can loot and kill as we please.</i>

37:19.445 --> 37:21.155
<i>When I play the games,</i>

37:21.239 --> 37:22.949
<i>it's like, "I don't fuckin' care!"</i>

37:23.032 --> 37:24.450
<i>Total freedom. Oh yeah!</i>

37:25.701 --> 37:27.036
<i>It feels pretty great.</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:30.539
<i>I hate it here.</i>

37:31.123 --> 37:33.626
<i>That's why I'm smoking weed</i>…

37:33.709 --> 37:36.963
<i>…and just flipping out.</i>

37:42.718 --> 37:45.596
<i>It's been 26 days</i>
<i>since everyone disappeared.</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:58.567
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

38:00.820 --> 38:01.696
Ann?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.331
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>
<i>Is there something wrong?</i>

38:15.543 --> 38:17.128
<i>There are a lot more fish now.</i>

38:17.211 --> 38:19.380
<i>The plants</i>
<i>are starting to cover everything.</i>

38:19.880 --> 38:22.008
<i>It's like the further</i>
<i>we get from the city,</i>

38:22.091 --> 38:24.218
<i>the more that nature is growing rampant.</i>

38:24.927 --> 38:26.971
<i>Is that because</i>
<i>all the humans are gone?</i>

38:27.054 --> 38:29.140
<i>Well, sure, that's definitely part of it.</i>

38:29.640 --> 38:32.101
<i>But the plants have been growing</i>
<i>way too quickly.</i>

38:33.686 --> 38:36.439
<i>The people that are here</i>
<i>all came at different times.</i>

38:36.522 --> 38:39.567
<i>Certain things are rotting</i>
<i>more quickly than others.</i>

38:39.650 --> 38:41.944
<i>Time doesn't seem</i>
<i>to work the same way here.</i>

38:45.489 --> 38:46.657
<i>Where are you going?</i>

38:49.327 --> 38:51.203
<i>I'm going to try to get out of Tokyo.</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:54.040
<i>I wanna know what's behind all this.</i>

39:01.297 --> 39:04.133
<i>It's been 33 days</i>
<i>since everyone disappeared.</i>

39:05.092 --> 39:07.053
<i>I got a tip from a man I ran into.</i>

39:08.387 --> 39:11.265
<i>Apparently, there's a whole community</i>
<i>outside of Setagaya.</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:12.892
<i>I'm headed there right now.</i>

39:28.449 --> 39:30.951
<i>Hi. I came here</i>
<i>because I heard a rumor</i>

39:31.035 --> 39:33.954
<i>about someone who has a memory</i>
<i>about what happened to us.</i>

39:34.663 --> 39:36.290
<i>Could you take me to them?</i>

39:37.041 --> 39:38.376
<i>Sure, it's just over here.</i>

39:43.089 --> 39:45.174
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what it is they remember?</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:49.387
<i>Do you remember the day</i>
<i>you arrived in this world, huh?</i>

39:50.137 --> 39:51.555
<i>Yeah. I think so.</i>

39:53.057 --> 39:54.892
<i>Did you see something in the sky?</i>

39:55.643 --> 39:58.062
<i>-The fireworks?</i>
-<i>Fireworks?</i>

39:59.688 --> 40:02.608
<i>Yes, I remember. I saw them.</i>

40:05.444 --> 40:06.821
<i>Yeah, I saw them too.</i>

40:08.781 --> 40:10.533
<i>This way. Come on.</i>

40:22.878 --> 40:26.340
<i>This woman has a pretty crazy story</i>
<i>about them. Come on.</i>

40:27.425 --> 40:29.009
<i>She's there. Over there.</i>

40:31.512 --> 40:34.598
<i>This guy wants to hear</i>
<i>about the fireworks. Can you tell him?</i>

40:36.642 --> 40:37.685
<i>Huh?</i>

40:38.519 --> 40:39.437
<i>Oh.</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:41.772
<i>The fireworks.</i>

40:46.652 --> 40:49.822
<i>I have a story about them.</i>
<i>Would you like to hear it?</i>

40:50.781 --> 40:51.782
<i>Yes.</i>

40:54.660 --> 40:56.996
<i>I must be the only one who remembers.</i>

40:58.581 --> 40:59.623
<i>Oh?</i>

41:02.626 --> 41:04.170
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:07.423
<i>I had a brain operation,</i>

41:07.506 --> 41:10.092
<i>so they drilled a hole, a little one,</i>

41:10.176 --> 41:11.886
<i>right here into my skull.</i>

41:13.804 --> 41:15.347
<i>Maybe that's the reason.</i>

41:18.392 --> 41:19.768
<i>I'm the only person</i>

41:20.644 --> 41:23.355
<i>who seems to remember</i>
<i>everything about that day.</i>

41:25.858 --> 41:27.276
<i>When…</i>

41:28.027 --> 41:29.111
<i>those…</i>

41:29.612 --> 41:31.697
<i>fireworks flew up into the sky…</i>

41:34.492 --> 41:35.451
<i>I saw them.</i>

41:36.243 --> 41:37.369
<i>They flashed,</i>

41:38.245 --> 41:39.747
<i>and they looked real.</i>

41:41.499 --> 41:42.374
<i>But…</i>

41:43.709 --> 41:44.752
<i>but…</i>

41:46.420 --> 41:48.047
<i>they weren't actually--</i>

41:55.095 --> 41:57.890
<i>It's the King of Spades!</i>

42:31.632 --> 42:33.092
<i>This documentary…</i>

42:35.177 --> 42:37.763
<i>is the only proof that I ever existed.</i>

42:39.807 --> 42:42.851
<i>I'll do whatever I can to keep it safe</i>
<i>until it's found.</i>

43:15.175 --> 43:16.468
What's that sound?

43:30.482 --> 43:32.651
Arisu, this way!

43:37.156 --> 43:39.366
Watch out! That way!

44:01.180 --> 44:02.097
Usagi!

44:14.026 --> 44:14.985
Hey!

45:27.641 --> 45:28.684
Usagi?

45:33.272 --> 45:34.398
Who's there?

46:01.592 --> 46:03.302
Are you a citizen?

46:04.595 --> 46:05.721
Huh?

46:07.473 --> 46:08.849
I guess you're not.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.355
Why did you attack me?

46:16.774 --> 46:19.234
You woulda gotten killed
if you'd kept running like that.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.864
I told him to leave you behind.
We don't need dead weight.

46:25.240 --> 46:28.368
But guess what?
He wanted to carry you all the way here.

46:29.870 --> 46:30.913
Who did?

46:38.670 --> 46:41.173
You'd better thank him, Arisu.

46:42.966 --> 46:44.718
How do you know my name?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.595
That's what he called you.

46:51.975 --> 46:53.644
Oh, watch out.

46:54.561 --> 46:58.273
He's in a pretty foul mood
since you messed up our plan.

47:43.485 --> 47:44.570
Aguni?

47:47.489 --> 47:48.699
Hey, newbie.
