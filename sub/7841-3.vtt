00:28.120 --> 00:30.259
Okay, Maggie.

00:30.260 --> 00:31.840
Say your "good nights."

00:31.841 --> 00:33.887
Good night, Teddy Bear.

00:33.888 --> 00:36.026
Good night, Justin Timberwolf.

00:36.027 --> 00:38.481
Good night, Bedtime Krusty.

00:38.846 --> 00:40.568
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

00:40.569 --> 00:43.013
Krusty's Anti-Bedbug Spray
sold separately.

00:43.014 --> 00:44.188
May contain poison.

00:44.189 --> 00:46.536
Good night, Maggie.

00:49.035 --> 00:50.970
Come on, sweetie.

00:50.972 --> 00:52.826
Everyone's going to sleep.

00:52.821 --> 00:54.373
You know you make me wanna

00:54.370 --> 00:54.826
Shout!

00:54.829 --> 00:56.093
Throw my hands up and

00:56.095 --> 00:56.592
Shout!

00:56.597 --> 00:57.922
Kick my heels up and

00:57.927 --> 00:58.663
Shout!

01:02.418 --> 01:03.950
A little bit louder now

01:03.967 --> 01:05.663
A little bit louder now

01:14.818 --> 01:15.840
All right,

01:15.876 --> 01:17.900
I'll make you another bottle.

01:20.478 --> 01:22.643
Maggie's so clingy.

01:22.658 --> 01:24.580
Homer, hold her
while I pour the milk.

01:24.586 --> 01:25.920
No problem.

01:26.736 --> 01:29.030
My, you've grown.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.213
Wha...?!

01:38.217 --> 01:39.843
Spilled milk?

01:44.775 --> 01:47.091
All over the floor.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.483
Hey, Apu,

01:51.486 --> 01:52.761
what happened
to all your milk?

01:52.766 --> 01:54.313
I sold it all to teenagers.

01:54.316 --> 01:56.100
There's a rumor you
can mix milk,

01:56.107 --> 01:58.123
Mentos and Lotto scrapings

01:58.126 --> 01:59.483
to make jetpack fuel.

01:59.495 --> 02:00.171
Does it work?

02:00.255 --> 02:01.072
Kinda.

02:05.598 --> 02:06.200
Hey, Moe!

02:06.206 --> 02:06.972
Got any milk?

02:08.375 --> 02:09.941
It's either milk or paint.

02:12.815 --> 02:14.193
It's paint.

02:14.387 --> 02:15.660
Or is it?

02:17.368 --> 02:18.900
Yeah, it's paint.

02:18.988 --> 02:20.401
Well, then I'll have
to charge you extra,

02:20.406 --> 02:21.550
depending on the color.

02:21.557 --> 02:22.871
Uh, stick out your tongue.

02:23.075 --> 02:23.912
Eggshell?

02:23.918 --> 02:24.512
No.

02:24.747 --> 02:26.222
Malabar ivory?

02:26.225 --> 02:26.803
No.

02:26.866 --> 02:28.443
Mediterranean ecru?

02:28.446 --> 02:29.250
No.

02:29.428 --> 02:30.643
Ah! Here it is...

02:30.648 --> 02:31.283
white.

02:32.598 --> 02:34.262
Ooh, that's gonna cost ya.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.140
There must be a Web site

02:36.147 --> 02:37.093
that can help you deal

02:37.098 --> 02:38.130
with a clingy baby.

02:38.138 --> 02:39.212
Oh, I don't want to bother

02:39.217 --> 02:40.833
the Internet with my problem.

02:40.836 --> 02:41.702
Aw, come on, Mom.

02:41.708 --> 02:42.742
We'll help you surf.

02:43.577 --> 02:44.370
Click that one, Mom.

02:44.375 --> 02:44.910
No, go up.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.240
Keep going

02:45.247 --> 02:45.633
up, up, up!

02:45.637 --> 02:46.473
The blue ones are ads.

02:46.488 --> 02:47.260
That's the toolbar.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.313
Now you've opened Word;

02:48.315 --> 02:48.812
close it.

02:48.816 --> 02:50.433
Close it. Do-Don't save it.

02:50.435 --> 02:51.152
Stop clicking.

02:51.158 --> 02:51.740
Don't go there!

02:51.747 --> 02:53.103
Why are you
buying a freezer?

02:53.105 --> 02:54.763
Don't click the cart
or you've bought it!

02:54.765 --> 02:56.863
Aw, you clicked
the cart.

02:56.868 --> 02:59.401
If you're so smart, you do it.

03:04.378 --> 03:05.370
C.R.I.E?

03:05.377 --> 03:06.713
What does that stand for?

03:06.717 --> 03:09.853
"Creative Responses
for Infant Edu-loving!"

03:09.857 --> 03:11.693
Ooh, "edu-loving!"

03:11.698 --> 03:13.170
They come to your home to help

03:13.178 --> 03:14.422
you raise "independent,

03:14.438 --> 03:16.213
self-actualized children."

03:16.217 --> 03:17.533
"The counselors can come

03:17.537 --> 03:18.683
day and night because

03:18.688 --> 03:20.500
they have no families
themselves."

03:20.515 --> 03:22.291
Okay, I'll sign up.

03:22.406 --> 03:24.100
You just bought
another freezer.

03:24.106 --> 03:25.983
Well, maybe I wanted
another freezer!

03:26.428 --> 03:28.452
I've got to find milk somewhere.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.860
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

03:49.637 --> 03:52.013
<i>On the dark side</i>

03:52.706 --> 03:54.403
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

04:01.446 --> 04:03.743
<i>Oh... yeah!</i>

04:05.155 --> 04:06.591
You want milk?!

04:06.598 --> 04:08.770
I got your milk right here.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.580
At first I thought you were
pointing to your crouch.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.551
You thought, huh?

04:15.556 --> 04:16.519
Yo, everybody!

04:16.528 --> 04:18.612
Get a load of "Beautiful Mind" over here,

04:18.618 --> 04:19.540
with the thinkin'.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.881
Listen up, ya humps!

04:22.887 --> 04:24.863
Which one of youz
parked at the bank?

04:24.868 --> 04:27.452
'Cause they're towing
your sorry ass.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.072
That's my car!

04:31.088 --> 04:32.323
Yo, Angelica.

04:32.328 --> 04:33.143
Get over here.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.210
This don't mean nothing.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.743
Ah, please! Give me a break!

04:43.746 --> 04:44.700
I've been driving all night,

04:44.705 --> 04:46.331
looking for milk for my kids.

04:46.866 --> 04:47.912
I'll tell you what.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.803
I'll give you a ride to
the impound lot.

04:49.815 --> 04:51.912
Okay, let me just grab
my registration.

05:01.136 --> 05:03.210
I can't believe your
boss lets you listen

05:03.216 --> 05:05.220
to rock music while you work.

05:05.225 --> 05:06.471
My boss?

05:07.848 --> 05:09.272
I don't think my boss has

05:09.275 --> 05:10.751
a problem with anything I do.

05:10.757 --> 05:13.191
Oh, I'd really like to meet this guy.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.182
Well, he's in this truck right now.

05:18.896 --> 05:20.522
But it's just you and me.

05:21.116 --> 05:22.640
That must mean...

05:22.645 --> 05:24.043
I'm your boss!

05:24.048 --> 05:25.931
I'm sick of you!
You're fired!

05:25.936 --> 05:27.340
No, you dumb Dominick.

05:27.347 --> 05:28.640
I'm my own boss.

05:28.645 --> 05:29.903
Shut up!

05:30.207 --> 05:32.232
When you call in sick,
who do you call?

05:32.235 --> 05:35.102
I don't call in sick.
I work when I want to.

05:35.106 --> 05:36.971
Sometimes you want to work?

05:36.978 --> 05:39.610
Hey, I get to drive around,
eat what I want,

05:39.616 --> 05:41.252
eyeball the highway honeys...

05:42.047 --> 05:44.121
I'm your aunt, stupid!

05:44.127 --> 05:45.650
...and lasso the street cattle.

05:45.658 --> 05:46.581
Street cattle?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.533
The cars I tow,

05:47.536 --> 05:49.240
I got all kinds of names for them:

05:49.247 --> 05:51.163
She-atas, Hebrew canoes,

05:51.166 --> 05:53.430
spam cans,Swedish speedballs,

05:53.438 --> 05:55.620
and of course,stretch lame-os.

05:55.628 --> 05:57.261
Some of those were pretty funny.

05:59.417 --> 06:00.470
Check it out.

06:00.472 --> 06:02.136
We already got a "whine line."

06:02.131 --> 06:03.563
When can I get my Beamer?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.566
I can't be out in this neighborhood!

06:05.579 --> 06:06.981
My jewelry's real!

06:06.985 --> 06:08.570
You can't tow a hybrid.

06:08.578 --> 06:11.451
My blow better still be in the glove box.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.230
Wow, you make people miserable

06:13.237 --> 06:15.023
anthere's nothing they can do about it!

06:15.025 --> 06:16.492
Just like God.

06:16.498 --> 06:19.963
Man, oh, man, you got the greatest job in the world.

06:21.368 --> 06:23.213
You know, if you're interested,

06:23.215 --> 06:25.000
we could use another hook jockey.

06:25.007 --> 06:26.911
The Springfield territory's wide open,

06:26.926 --> 06:28.831
since Flatbed Fred got killed

06:28.837 --> 06:30.870
in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.

06:30.888 --> 06:32.251
I would love to!

06:32.258 --> 06:34.772
Oh, but I don't have a tow truck.

06:34.775 --> 06:37.230
For 500 bucks, I'll sell you this old bucket.

06:37.508 --> 06:41.460
Hmm... I'm not sure my wife will go
for this naughty mud flaps.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.923
Not to worry. These...

06:43.927 --> 06:45.483
are the ones you show at home.

06:45.537 --> 06:48.080
That's still too sexy for my wife.

06:48.127 --> 06:48.951
No problem.

06:50.858 --> 06:54.022
Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day

06:54.025 --> 06:56.041
and it haunts you for the rest of your life.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.683
Now just remember two rules.

06:57.857 --> 06:59.733
One, stick to Springfield.

06:59.755 --> 07:01.113
If I catch you on my turf,

07:01.118 --> 07:02.192
I'll rip off your head,

07:02.207 --> 07:03.171
vomit down your neck,

07:03.177 --> 07:04.093
pull out your heart,

07:04.095 --> 07:04.981
show it to your head,

07:04.985 --> 07:06.952
then shove 'em both down your neck hole,

07:06.955 --> 07:08.483
to which I previously alluded.

07:08.486 --> 07:10.261
"...which I previously alluded..."

07:10.268 --> 07:11.731
Are there two "L's" in "alluded"?

07:11.736 --> 07:12.601
Rule number two,

07:12.608 --> 07:14.242
always keep your hook pointed out.

07:14.256 --> 07:16.392
Why? What happens if I point it this way?

07:16.397 --> 07:17.630
Oh hello-o!

07:17.637 --> 07:20.361
Hello! Hello, Captain Hook!

07:21.116 --> 07:22.551
Oh, spoil sport.

07:22.557 --> 07:23.733
Oh, you're no fun.

07:30.985 --> 07:33.031
Ah, my first tow.

07:34.735 --> 07:37.781
I think it goes... here.

07:42.245 --> 07:43.392
D'oh!

07:46.275 --> 07:48.103
Ah, my first tow.

07:52.575 --> 07:53.502
Stop. Stop.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.141
I'm entitled to park there.

07:55.155 --> 07:57.370
Really? What's your handicap?

07:57.376 --> 08:00.470
Pogonophobia--fear of beards and mustaches.

08:03.505 --> 08:06.160
Well, I guess I can call a cab.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.692
Stay back! All of ya!

08:22.436 --> 08:23.360
Faster!

08:23.815 --> 08:25.050
More dangerous!

08:38.835 --> 08:41.179
Marge, your code pendent hyper-nurturing

08:41.196 --> 08:42.922
has infantilized your baby.

08:42.924 --> 08:44.920
You've made her queen of her "clingdom."

08:44.927 --> 08:46.912
Ooh, did you hearthat, Maggie-wags?

08:46.918 --> 08:48.332
You're a queen.

08:48.335 --> 08:50.132
Marge, you're reinforcing a negative.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.072
I'm what?

08:51.205 --> 08:53.103
Allow me to demonstri-care.

08:54.087 --> 08:55.321
Actualize!

08:59.047 --> 09:02.700
And now you are free
to live like a human being.

09:06.557 --> 09:08.381
Maggie's crying.

09:08.388 --> 09:09.492
She's not crying,

09:09.496 --> 09:11.302
She's celebrating her independence.

09:11.307 --> 09:12.693
Don't crash that party.

09:12.698 --> 09:15.230
Oh... one hug can't hurt.

09:15.236 --> 09:17.313
Yes, it can-- hugs are drugs,

09:17.318 --> 09:18.640
and your daughter's an addict.

09:19.507 --> 09:23.611
I guess it's time to let
my little girl grow up.

09:28.708 --> 09:29.711
You see?

09:30.116 --> 09:32.883
Now her childhood can begin-ualize.

09:33.128 --> 09:35.610
Huh. Thank you, CRIE.

09:36.486 --> 09:38.431
I'm, huh, I'm sorry about the kick.

09:38.435 --> 09:40.703
I've never done anything
like that before.

09:40.707 --> 09:43.663
Yeah, well, I'm glad your first
time was such a success.

09:46.585 --> 09:48.043
What the hell are you doing?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.572
I'm doing my job.

09:49.576 --> 09:51.330
You're hovering over a hydrant.

09:57.316 --> 09:58.851
You're in the sky now--

09:58.855 --> 10:00.311
my domain.

10:12.238 --> 10:13.740
I've got tow dough

10:13.745 --> 10:15.211
I'm looking
to blow, Moe.

10:15.227 --> 10:15.661
Huh?

10:15.668 --> 10:18.663
I'm buying a round of the
fanciest drink you got.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.983
Four "Lobster-politans" comin' up.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.761
Here's to Homer and the cars he towed.

10:34.778 --> 10:36.172
With those jerks out of the way,

10:36.178 --> 10:38.022
I was able to park right outside.

10:38.028 --> 10:38.750
Outside?

10:38.835 --> 10:40.301
That's a one-hour parking zone,

10:40.308 --> 10:41.930
and you've been here a good 81 minutes.

10:41.946 --> 10:44.632
Correction: a great 81 minutes.

10:44.636 --> 10:47.192
'Cause nothing beats hangin' around with old friends,

10:47.198 --> 10:49.822
drinkin' lobster-based designer drinks and...

10:51.838 --> 10:53.653
Huh, good joke, Homer.

10:54.246 --> 10:55.832
You can unhook my car now.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.191
Uh, looks like he's driving away with it.

10:59.195 --> 11:03.001
No, he's just moving it so it won't get towed.

11:19.965 --> 11:23.111
Maggie, what can I get you for breakf...?

11:24.646 --> 11:26.373
You did everything yourself.

11:28.097 --> 11:29.522
Homer, where have you been?

11:29.556 --> 11:32.190
Marge, when you're married
to a midnight towboy,

11:32.355 --> 11:34.150
you might not see him
for days on end.

11:34.286 --> 11:35.840
I don't want to live like that.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.902
Hey, when you married a man
who would, years later,

11:39.007 --> 11:41.212
without warning, become
a tow truck driver,

11:41.457 --> 11:43.730
you knew what the deal
would eventually be.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.841
Well, no one's disputing that.

11:46.016 --> 11:46.910
Guess what, boy?

11:47.048 --> 11:49.530
Last night I towed
your principal's car.

11:49.666 --> 11:51.870
Oh, awesome.
How's he getting around?

11:55.196 --> 11:57.323
You can't impound my spirit.

12:02.278 --> 12:03.600
Top of the mornin', Tow-mer.

12:03.748 --> 12:05.891
It's Homer, idiot.

12:06.356 --> 12:07.362
So it is.

12:07.615 --> 12:10.011
I'm just here to pay the fine
for the Sunday School bus.

12:10.217 --> 12:11.952
You towed it
with the kids still in it.

12:13.307 --> 12:16.253
I guess I'm more powerful
than God now.

12:16.355 --> 12:17.301
You know what they say:

12:17.406 --> 12:19.882
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

12:20.097 --> 12:20.983
Who said that?!

12:21.206 --> 12:22.782
I'll kill them with my power.

12:25.937 --> 12:28.213
Take that, you tow-talitarian.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.712
Doesn't that joke make
light of totalitarians?

12:31.686 --> 12:34.872
Stalin put my grandmother
in a forced labor camp for 20 years.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.861
Look, I was insensitive,
and I'm sorry.

12:37.118 --> 12:39.410
But what this is really about
is a bully with a winch.

12:39.548 --> 12:42.762
If I'd wanted the laws of this
town enforced to the letter,

12:42.938 --> 12:45.272
I wouldn't have hired fatty here
as police chief.

12:45.616 --> 12:47.682
Hear that, Ralphie?
The mayor knows daddy.

12:48.597 --> 12:49.801
All right, listen up.

12:50.057 --> 12:52.283
I know a thing or two
about tow-Joes.

12:52.457 --> 12:55.461
I married three of them,
and they're real territorial.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.012
Now here's the plan...

12:58.318 --> 13:00.580
Get in here, Mel.
I don't bite.

13:00.748 --> 13:02.823
I might gum ya,
and you might like it.

13:15.758 --> 13:18.211
Must we all wait
behind this bush?

13:18.415 --> 13:19.713
I have theater tickets.

13:19.896 --> 13:20.942
Theater tickets, huh?

13:21.545 --> 13:22.552
Now ya got nothin'.

13:38.396 --> 13:40.883
Maggie's completely independent.

13:41.368 --> 13:44.540
At least you need me,
sack of potatoes.

14:03.055 --> 14:04.602
Oh, my God...

14:05.175 --> 14:07.903
multiple tickets,
handicapped spot,

14:08.255 --> 14:11.471
parked by a hydrant,
incomprehensible vanity plate.

14:12.036 --> 14:15.253
If my life as a tow truck driver
were a teleplay,

14:15.385 --> 14:17.422
this would be the end of act two.

14:28.206 --> 14:30.131
I told you to stay off my turf!

14:30.406 --> 14:32.172
What? I'm still in Springfield.

14:35.158 --> 14:36.021
Wha...?!

14:36.575 --> 14:37.701
Okay, I made a mistake.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.572
Why don't you give me
two demerit points

14:39.686 --> 14:41.652
in a point system
we work out right now?

14:50.287 --> 14:51.901
Put me down, you lousy--

14:53.827 --> 14:55.051
Okay, I'm warning you--

14:56.875 --> 14:58.633
I'll kill you, you son of a--

15:00.378 --> 15:02.852
All right buddy,
that's it, I've had--

15:12.737 --> 15:14.201
You... let go!

15:16.018 --> 15:18.432
All right, Just... let... go.

15:21.426 --> 15:23.413
Oh, a trap door.
What's down there?

15:23.577 --> 15:24.742
Your Meatball collection?

15:24.916 --> 15:26.292
- Good-bye.
- I thought we were friends!

15:26.398 --> 15:28.161
I was kidding you
in a friendly fashion!

15:31.905 --> 15:32.963
Who are you guys?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.161
We're just like you.

15:34.565 --> 15:36.382
Tow truck drivers who got greedy.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.832
Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?

15:39.006 --> 15:42.312
No. We're waiting for him
to give us a timesha representation.

15:42.657 --> 15:44.351
Actually,
we're an a cappella group

15:44.466 --> 15:46.301
and we're gonna sing
"Under the BoardWalk."

15:46.485 --> 15:49.031
The truth is, we're just waiting
for each others' hair to grow

15:49.217 --> 15:50.210
so we can braid it.

15:51.808 --> 15:53.862
Okay, I get it.
I'm not stupid.

15:53.985 --> 15:55.302
It's number two, right?

15:56.637 --> 15:59.401
<i>Under the boardwalk</i>

16:00.385 --> 16:04.800
<i>Down by the sea</i>

16:05.456 --> 16:11.680
<i>On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be</i>

16:12.957 --> 16:14.502
<i>Under the boardwalk</i>

16:15.187 --> 16:17.660
<i>Out of the sun!</i>

16:17.785 --> 16:19.500
It sure is great not
having Homer around

16:19.626 --> 16:21.462
to tell us where we
can or can't park.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.630
Yeah, without the crushing
rule of law,

16:23.776 --> 16:26.180
society will do a better job
of regulating itself.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.032
Of all the nerve!

16:45.156 --> 16:47.482
Now to buy some soft luggage.

16:52.416 --> 16:54.210
Dad?
Where are you?

16:54.418 --> 16:56.303
Do not worry.
I am working.

16:56.468 --> 16:57.790
Working?
Where?

16:58.028 --> 16:59.280
Ask no questions.

16:59.395 --> 17:02.070
And do not call the police,
or I will kill me.

17:02.257 --> 17:03.292
You sound weird.

17:03.447 --> 17:05.251
All is well.
Good-bye forever.

17:08.146 --> 17:09.391
Get out of the way!

17:09.518 --> 17:10.602
That's my space.

17:10.746 --> 17:11.910
I was here first.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.542
Avast, ye sky whale!

17:27.887 --> 17:29.271
I need a camera battery!

17:38.206 --> 17:42.740
All the Transformers transformed
back into trucks and cars.

17:43.046 --> 17:44.062
The end.

17:44.235 --> 17:45.520
- That's great.
- Great story.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.220
Okay, we've got time
for one more.

17:47.518 --> 17:48.780
Oh, yeah. All right.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.061
Once upon a time,

17:50.226 --> 17:53.171
there was a hilarious ogre
named Shrek Three.

17:53.346 --> 17:54.901
He lived in medieval times,

17:55.138 --> 17:58.021
but sometimes he'd say things
from today times...

18:00.225 --> 18:01.240
Got one!

18:06.728 --> 18:08.192
We can say these swears
any time we want

18:08.318 --> 18:09.323
because they're
in the Bible!

18:09.458 --> 18:11.371
I don't think "Leviticus"
is a swear.

18:11.506 --> 18:13.183
Shut the hell up,
you damn ass whore.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.091
Bart?

18:15.746 --> 18:18.031
I'm starting to worry
about your father.

18:18.246 --> 18:20.442
Well, I know he seems
to get dumber every year,

18:20.556 --> 18:21.730
but lately he's plateaued.

18:21.895 --> 18:24.263
He hasn't been home in four days.

18:25.157 --> 18:27.250
Well, I guess he told me
not to worry.

18:28.737 --> 18:30.681
Where are you, Homie?

19:15.115 --> 19:16.581
Yah, yah, doggies!

19:38.597 --> 19:41.643
And if elected president
of our small community,

19:41.797 --> 19:47.132
I will determine once and for all
how far we can go without being gay.

19:51.165 --> 19:52.050
Maggie!

20:08.195 --> 20:09.112
We're free!

20:11.036 --> 20:11.903
Maggie!

20:12.156 --> 20:13.510
You did all this?!

20:15.828 --> 20:18.411
And to pay you back,
I'm returning your nose.

20:18.848 --> 20:19.981
Here's your nose.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.612
Daddy's putting back your nose.

20:22.816 --> 20:25.050
That's your--Oh, wait.
That's Lisa's nose.

20:27.205 --> 20:28.102
Homie!

20:28.195 --> 20:29.321
You're all right!

20:31.227 --> 20:32.371
Thanks to her!

20:34.365 --> 20:35.423
Really?

20:35.646 --> 20:36.723
Look at you...

20:36.955 --> 20:38.412
so grown up.

20:38.996 --> 20:41.222
Well, I've moved on, too.

20:51.978 --> 20:53.003
Are you sure?

20:53.518 --> 20:54.402
Hugs are dr...
