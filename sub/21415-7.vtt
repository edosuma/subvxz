01:22.916 --> 01:23.916
Fore!

01:27.121 --> 01:28.522
Pat.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.159
Good to see you taking
some time off to relax.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.626
You obviously haven't seen my golf.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.795
Ah, I've been watching

01:34.862 --> 01:36.830
the box office numbers on Angels.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.233
Looks like your boy genius
has done it again.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.935
It's a Brady-American Picture, Louis,

01:42.002 --> 01:43.837
and it has allowed me this.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.807
Your loan.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.144
$2 million, paid in full, plus interest.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.845
What's this about?

01:51.912 --> 01:54.882
Let's just say I don't like
being in debt.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.450
To me.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.452
I know what Angels made, Pat,

01:58.519 --> 02:00.854
and I know what your
operating costs are.

02:00.921 --> 02:04.958
A check this big leaves you
with nothing in the bank.

02:05.025 --> 02:09.363
And yet, somehow I walk away,

02:09.430 --> 02:12.766
feeling richer than I was before.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.311
I thought we talked about you

02:57.378 --> 02:59.480
watching me sleep.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.349
I'm just thinking too much.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.418
Well, don't do that.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.523
I've kept something from you,

03:09.590 --> 03:12.426
and I don't want it between us.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.531
Minna, um...

03:17.598 --> 03:21.569
she wasn't what the public saw.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.171
Nobody is.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.507
She could be very up,

03:26.574 --> 03:29.877
and then she would spiral into a place

03:29.943 --> 03:34.715
where she just... couldn't be reached.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.521
There was drinking, pills.

03:41.822 --> 03:46.093
The day my doctor told me
about my condition,

03:46.159 --> 03:49.229
I came home to tell her...

03:49.297 --> 03:52.466
I was scared and lost.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.503
But she couldn't...

03:56.970 --> 04:01.442
She relied on me for so much,
she just...

04:01.509 --> 04:03.344
came apart, started screaming,

04:03.411 --> 04:06.347
saying I was going to abandon her,

04:06.414 --> 04:10.818
that I was going to die
and leave her alone.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.591
So I put her in bed, and, uh...

04:17.658 --> 04:21.661
and I gave her some sleeping pills...

04:23.163 --> 04:27.601
and, uh, I went out and I...

04:27.668 --> 04:32.005
hit every bar in town.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.708
And when I got home...

04:38.712 --> 04:40.247
the house was on fire.

04:40.314 --> 04:44.017
She, uh... she'd fallen asleep

04:44.084 --> 04:45.285
with a lit cigarette.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.888
Oh...

04:47.955 --> 04:49.357
I left her.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.191
I left her, and...

04:51.258 --> 04:52.960
No.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.064
It was an accident.
No.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.236
We've all done things we regret.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.741
It doesn't make us bad people.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.780
Maybe it does.
No, sweetheart, it doesn't.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.184
Monroe.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.653
What are you doing here?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.622
I was hoping to catch you alone.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.391
I thought we weren't doing that anymore.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.596
What can I do for you, Mr. Stahr?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.500
I didn't want you to hear it
from someone else.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.369
We've known each other for a long time.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.204
Out with it, Monroe.

06:11.271 --> 06:15.008
I proposed to Kathleen.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.777
We're getting married.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.516
I see.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.085
It's not something I ever thought

06:25.152 --> 06:26.086
would happen for me.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.121
I'm happy for you.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.765
I think I need to be happy for you.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.135
Not quite the same.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.838
It's close enough.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.374
For the moment.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.576
I don't want us to be...

06:48.642 --> 06:50.210
You know, I used to spend summers

06:50.277 --> 06:52.613
with my cousin Margaret.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.883
Her family loved to travel.

06:55.949 --> 06:59.086
They'd always bring us
somewhere different.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.790
That was the gift.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.225
Every summer a clean slate.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.829
It didn't matter what happened
the summer before...

07:08.896 --> 07:12.900
who you'd kissed, who you'd cried over,

07:12.966 --> 07:14.267
what you'd been punished for.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.805
You just got to start over, fresh.

07:19.540 --> 07:23.977
That's what I want for the both of us.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.248
Pat doesn't really know you, does he?

07:29.316 --> 07:33.353
Maybe not.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.524
But he chose me.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.992
I think that counts for something.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.540
I would have run away with you.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.742
In another life.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.245
I would have run away with you, too.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.858
Maybe next summer.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.701
Celia.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.270
Celia. Celia!

08:23.336 --> 08:25.172
Go back to sleep.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.583
But it's morning.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.976
That's not possible.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.780
It's light outside. We need breakfast.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.182
Nathan, why do you have to be so loud?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.585
And lunch. For school.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.219
What time is school?

08:39.285 --> 08:41.488
Never.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.289
Darla...

08:43.356 --> 08:46.259
I told your brother
I would look out for you.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.895
You have to go to school.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.863
Fine.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.902
Okay, breakfast and lunch.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.114
Maybe we'll go out for breakfast.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.618
This is Valentina.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.452
This is Chanel.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.787
This is Schiaparelli,

09:13.854 --> 09:15.656
like Wallis Simpson wore.
Hmm.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.859
This one we love. Very Carole Lombard.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.194
Well, she might need them all.
Oh.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.297
Yeah, full wardrobe.
There'll be press events,

09:24.364 --> 09:26.266
interviews, premieres.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.501
So, day dresses, evening gowns.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.271
This is Adrian.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.706
Mona Bismarck just wore it.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.541
I loathe Mona Bismarck.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.744
Who doesn't?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.782
Any of them appeal to you?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.918
I can pick anything?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.355
Anything.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.923
Who do you want to be?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.763
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.738
Cut on rehearsal!

10:42.876 --> 10:44.912
Honey, what, what's the matter?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.681
Why is it scary?
Huh?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.684
The city. Why is it scary?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.653
Everyone's dancing, and I hated Iowa.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.755
Uh...

10:54.822 --> 10:57.424
What if, before you left home,

10:57.490 --> 11:00.761
your ma warns Aunt Sue
to be careful of pickpockets?

11:00.828 --> 11:03.196
And you say, "That's a funny word."

11:03.263 --> 11:05.265
And your ma says,
"It's not a funny thing."

11:05.332 --> 11:08.201
And what if, in this scene,
you see a pickpocket

11:08.268 --> 11:10.871
steal another man's wallet and run off?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.873
Uh, we could add something like that,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.074
couldn't we, John?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.408
Yeah, sure.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.409
Would that help?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.578
You see, John?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.113
That's called writing.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.490
Rehearsal's up!

11:24.517 --> 11:25.819
And, by the way,

11:25.886 --> 11:27.387
there aren't any buildings

11:27.454 --> 11:28.555
a hundred miles high.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.257
That's way too tall.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.763
All right, everyone, back to the top.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.896
Places, people. Places!

11:35.963 --> 11:37.798
Quiet on the set.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.767
I told Nathan a roast beef sandwich

11:39.833 --> 11:43.203
wasn't really breakfast food,
but he really wanted it, so...

11:45.405 --> 11:46.974
What's this?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.409
I had some groceries
sent over this morning.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.379
The kids didn't have much
to take to school.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.083
Thought I'd set up
a weekly delivery for you,

11:56.149 --> 11:59.619
just until you got back on your feet.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.121
Max?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.622
Thank you.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.024
We can't accept this.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.125
Come on.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.160
You needed food, I got you food.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.728
And, and I'm happy to help.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.031
This week? Next week? Every week?

12:11.098 --> 12:13.200
If that's what you need.

12:13.266 --> 12:17.037
I'm an office boy with two kids to feed.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.040
Until that changes,
I'm always gonna need something.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.146
I want you,

12:26.213 --> 12:28.181
not your money.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.883
And as soon as you start thinking of me

12:29.950 --> 12:32.485
as some... charity case...

12:32.552 --> 12:33.954
That's not how I see you.

12:34.021 --> 12:37.791
This is why people like us
don't end up together.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
Except in the pictures.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.830
Because in real life,
you end up with the son of a banker

12:42.896 --> 12:44.564
or a shipping magnate

12:44.631 --> 12:46.666
or Monroe Stahr.

12:46.733 --> 12:50.103
That's not what I want.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.442
I have to go.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.215
Look magazine just launched.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.217
They need a fresh face
for their next cover.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.286
I've got a friend there,
I can put in a call.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.621
Well, with a pitch that good,
how could they say no?

13:08.688 --> 13:11.124
Well, we all think she's gonna
be great in the picture,

13:11.191 --> 13:13.927
but we can't pretend
anybody knows who she is.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.063
That's your job, isn't it?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.664
I want Kathleen to be a household name

13:17.730 --> 13:20.834
before the first poster goes up
for An Enemy Among Us.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.104
Morning, sunshine.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.482
Did we wake you?
Sorry, I was in a script meeting.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.541
We were just discussing
how to make the world

13:28.608 --> 13:30.077
fall in love with Kathleen.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.344
Should be easy enough.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.880
What made you fall in love with her?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.115
Yeah, Monroe,

13:35.182 --> 13:37.450
tell us what made you pop the question.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.923
Engaged? Wow.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.724
Congratulations, Monroe.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.593
Here's an idea:

13:46.659 --> 13:50.163
she is the studio tour guide
who finally made it.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.966
No, most people think
being a tour guide is making it.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.335
She's Cinderella, the poor ingenue

13:55.402 --> 13:57.037
transformed by the magic of movies.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.606
I'm not sure that would
make me want to buy a magazine.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.576
The thing about Kathleen is...

14:03.643 --> 14:05.712
she's your closest friend,

14:05.778 --> 14:08.681
the girl next door, the waitress

14:08.748 --> 14:12.419
you leave an extra nickel for
because she's got a sweet smile.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.556
We do the interview at the Foxhole.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.025
Where she started.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.727
I want people to see her,
the real Kathleen.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.929
Yes?
Yes.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.130
Let's set it up.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.517
Hello there.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.585
We have to keep looking.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.154
I mean, he could be anywhere.
Who?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.588
He could be here.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.293
You're here with me.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.595
You're safe.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.834
Some water.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.104
Thank you.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.054
Can you lie with me?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.926
Of course.

15:36.003 --> 15:41.908
"Let us pretend that we can make
out a plain and logical story,

15:41.975 --> 15:46.980
"so that when one matter is dispatched,
love for instance,

15:47.047 --> 15:51.584
we go on, in an orderly manner,
to the next..."

16:00.193 --> 16:01.861
So this is where it all started.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.430
How quaint.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.998
Were you secretly dreaming of stardom

16:05.065 --> 16:06.733
while you served up banana cream pie?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.168
My goodness, no.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.936
I think I spent most of my time

16:10.003 --> 16:11.904
trying to remember Nick's specials.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.674
Tell me about your family.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.409
Brothers? Sisters?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.610
No, just me.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.012
And your parents?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.481
My father died when I was young.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.051
My mother got a job
in the sugar factory.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.986
We didn't have much, but it was enough.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.022
Well, she must be very proud.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.024
Will she come over for the premiere?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.293
Oh, no, no.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.264
Um, my mother doesn't like to make a fuss.
Ah.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.199
She thinks Hollywood is folderol.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.967
Well...

16:41.034 --> 16:42.335
we can't put that in the article.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.104
We'd all be out of work.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.039
You know,
this doesn't happen very often,

16:46.106 --> 16:50.910
going from waiting tables
to starring in a big picture.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.845
Does it all feel too good to be true?

16:52.912 --> 16:55.014
Yes.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.317
Sometimes it does.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.392
You were wonderful
in the interview today.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.593
Was I?

17:06.659 --> 17:07.794
Yes.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.298
They're gonna love you.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.766
What does it matter if people love me?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.301
They don't even know me.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.502
Come on.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.339
You're a natural. They'll adore you.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.642
Oh, people believe anything you
write in those silly magazines.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.212
It's all just a story.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.047
It doesn't actually mean anything.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.550
Well, you're not just a story to me.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.564
What if I were?

17:46.699 --> 17:47.834
What do you mean?

17:51.804 --> 17:55.275
Take off your shirt.

17:57.944 --> 18:02.081
I said... take off your shirt.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.584
What?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.154
Your accent.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.322
Kathleen, I'm impressed.
Kathleen?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.591
Never heard of her.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.228
Okay.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.833
You think you know me,

18:20.900 --> 18:23.503
but you don't.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.812
We've never met before.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.747
We are strangers.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.753
you may hear some things tomorrow.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.224
About me.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.558
I'm gonna do something

18:45.625 --> 18:47.394
that's gonna make a lot of people angry.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.128
Can it be helped?

18:49.196 --> 18:51.164
No.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.699
Then do it.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.100
And forgive yourself.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.936
That's right.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.905
Thank you.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.344
You always forgive me, don't you?

19:06.045 --> 19:08.781
I know you love me.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.982
And our daughter.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.718
That I do.

19:11.784 --> 19:15.855
And I know if there was
something I really needed,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.590
you would kill to get it for me.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.492
That I would.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.640
I am suddenly reminded of a time

19:33.706 --> 19:36.443
when I used to sneak into your parents'
house

19:36.509 --> 19:40.480
at the age of 30 to see you.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.924
Your mother would never leave us alone.

19:41.948 --> 19:45.184
Hmm, she knew a wolf when she saw one.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.088
Then we'd go outside

19:49.155 --> 19:51.224
and kiss in the snow.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.927
Doesn't seem so long ago, does it?
Hmm.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.566
What happened to us?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.736
The normal things.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.838
Life.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.275
Hmm.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.709
I still love you, you know.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.611
I do.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.553
And I would do anything for you.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.121
Good.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.668
Let us in.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.179
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.505
Come on, we know he's in there.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.906
Mr. Brady happens to be

20:39.972 --> 20:41.874
on a very important phone call
at the moment.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.219
I'm sure he'll see
you as soon as he's through.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.413
Well, we're not going anywhere
until he does see us.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.156
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.282
What's going on?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.950
You don't know?
No.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.352
Our feudal lord in there

20:52.419 --> 20:54.954
just slashed every salary
on the lot by 30%.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.089
What?
No warning, no reason, just some big,

20:57.156 --> 21:00.026
weepy office memo in
everyone's mailbox this morning.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.461
"Dear valued employee,

21:01.528 --> 21:03.306
"I know this will be difficult,
blah, blah, blah.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.332
"The bank failed, blah, blah, blah.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.233
We're all in this together."

21:07.300 --> 21:10.236
I need to see him.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.838
He's not seeing anyone right now.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.906
I'm not anyone.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.709
I wonder how long I'm gonna live

21:16.776 --> 21:19.546
before I hear you knock
before charging in here.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.947
Sorry, but they're out there

21:21.013 --> 21:22.382
with pitchforks and torches.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.816
I didn't have a choice.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.553
Why didn't you talk to me about this?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.855
Angels is a smash; we're fine.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.957
Now we're fine.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.492
Yesterday we were in debt

21:32.559 --> 21:35.895
to a conniving,
manipulative enemy of this studio.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.531
Oh, Jesus.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.132
You paid Mayer off.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.769
He sat behind this desk like
it was nothing, needling me.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.504
Didn't bother you
the way it bothered me.

21:44.571 --> 21:48.007
So now you feel better
and the whole lot has to suffer?

21:48.074 --> 21:50.009
It isn't gonna last forever.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.079
He stole Margo Taft
right out from under us!

21:53.145 --> 21:56.416
He was trying to steal you!

21:56.483 --> 21:59.586
A studio has gates for a reason, Monroe.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.721
You can't treat people this way

22:01.788 --> 22:04.891
and expect them to do good work, Pat.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.259
No, but you can.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.328
They love you.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.530
They trust you.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.164
You're a sun god around here.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.101
Now, go out there and explain it
to 'em till they understand.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.107
Did you cut my salary, too?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.575
I had to.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.511
Would've looked awful.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.613
Take all of it.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.881
I'll work without pay
until this is resolved.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.550
There you have it;

22:30.617 --> 22:32.452
why they love you.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.387
Go do your job.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.135
I want out.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.437
And I want a pony.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.804
Look,

22:51.871 --> 22:55.007
we're partners,
which means, if I get nothing,

22:55.074 --> 22:56.776
you get nothing.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.711
He proposed.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.681
We're getting married.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.750
Great.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.753
I'll buy you a set of coasters.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.255
But I have an investment in you

23:09.321 --> 23:10.523
and I want my return.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.924
I'm gonna tell him.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.661
You'll be out on your ass.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.062
He'll understand.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.230
He loves me.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.432
You're a fake

23:19.499 --> 23:21.133
and a gold digger.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.069
What is there to love about you?

23:23.135 --> 23:25.505
You don't own me!

23:26.573 --> 23:28.708
Do you love him?

23:30.142 --> 23:32.211
Then picture this:

23:32.278 --> 23:35.047
everyone in town finding out
that Monroe Stahr

23:35.114 --> 23:39.018
got conned by an actress from Wisconsin.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.254
A thing like that
is hard to come back from,

23:42.321 --> 23:45.825
especially after you've broken
his heart, or what's left of it.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.227
What, y-you want to confess?

23:48.294 --> 23:49.729
Get rid of your guilt? Fine.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.098
But it'll destroy him.

23:52.164 --> 23:56.202
It's not a very nice thing to do
to someone that you love.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.908
Congrats on your engagement.

24:24.096 --> 24:27.534
Once I get finished,
nobody'll be any the wiser, dear.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.235
Don't worry.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.237
Thank you.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.510
That's quite a mark.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.714
It was silly, I was, uh,

24:41.781 --> 24:44.651
putting my suitcase on,
on the shelf in the closet.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.319
Fell and hit my face.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.255
Clumsy of me.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.691
Well, take care, Miss Moore.

24:51.758 --> 24:55.194
That face belongs to Pat Brady now.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.731
I'll be more careful.
Mm.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.237
And again.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.373
Don't hold back this time, sweetheart.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.775
Smile with your eyes.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.110
Kathleen, can you, uh,
turn towards camera more

25:11.177 --> 25:14.080
and, and pull your shoulders back?

25:15.548 --> 25:18.150
And again.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.320
Maybe I'm just not photogenic.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.556
Will you give us a minute?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.625
I'm sorry.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.794
For what? What are you sorry for?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.897
You're doing great. Listen to me.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.337
Stay there.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.608
Don't move.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.342
Kiss her again.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.311
Barry.
No, wait, wait, wait.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.513
Celia, I go behind the camera.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.716
Uh-huh.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.386
It's a romance.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.888
That's the story.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.523
People are going to love her

25:57.590 --> 25:59.826
because they see how much you love her.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.561
Well,
how much I love her is my business.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.597
Not anymore.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.398
Kiss her again.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.400
You okay with it?

26:08.467 --> 26:09.969
Of course she's okay with it.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.004
Barry.
Just a couple, Barry.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.917
Hey.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.020
Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.521
Sure, I guess.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.391
In private?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.894
Okay.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.364
Just, uh, follow me this way, everybody.
All right.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.179
Oh, my.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.215
I have to tell you something.
No, I was wrong

26:56.282 --> 26:59.051
and ungrateful.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.353
Monroe was...

27:01.420 --> 27:03.522
That was a little girl's fantasy.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.025
Silly.

27:06.092 --> 27:09.195
And whatever it was, it's over.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.898
I want you.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.734
And you were right.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.535
I know how it feels to be handed things,

27:16.602 --> 27:20.406
to have people think that
you can't do it on your own.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.181
Want me how?

27:33.953 --> 27:36.823
What are my options?

28:00.646 --> 28:04.083
I've never done this before.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.985
Neither have I.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.502
You didn't have to wait up for me.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.204
I'm your mother, Celia.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.107
I'll always be waiting up
for you one way or another.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.445
Oh...

28:33.512 --> 28:37.149
I haven't seen these in so long.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.951
When you were a baby, you couldn't stand

28:39.018 --> 28:40.787
to be away from me, even for a minute.

28:40.853 --> 28:44.891
You'd cry every time I left the room.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.534
Why aren't there any pictures of you?

28:55.601 --> 29:00.773
Well, once you have children,
the pictures are always of them.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.078
You know,
I saw you at the hospital the other day,

29:06.145 --> 29:09.548
taking that Max Miner home.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.650
Yep.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.355
That Max Miner.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.390
Careful.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.626
You're blushing.

29:22.661 --> 29:28.434
It took a little while, but...
we've gotten close.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.770
Are you happy when you're with him?

29:31.838 --> 29:34.440
Yes.
Mm.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.211
Are you "you" when you're with him?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.547
Definitely.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.717
Is that how you knew with Daddy?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.353
Yes.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.355
That's how I knew.

29:49.421 --> 29:52.358
All right.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.560
Well, I'm off to bed.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.896
I'm very tired.
Hmm.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.836
Good night.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.777
Hey. What gives?

30:11.844 --> 30:13.946
You know the rules, George.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.082
Everyone gets 30% less.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.517
We have to do something.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.187
Somebody bashes in your windshield,
you bash in theirs.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.788
This isn't a street fight, Aubrey.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.396
What?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.299
I need to talk to you.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.869
Where is she?

30:36.936 --> 30:39.271
She won't come out.
Sally?

30:39.338 --> 30:40.839
Sally, please.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.808
I'm not coming out!

30:42.875 --> 30:44.610
All right, what's her problem?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.279
We were supposed to receive
Bernadette's script revisions

30:47.346 --> 30:49.091
to rehearse this morning,
but they didn't arrive.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.984
So find Bernadette.
No one knows where she is.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.761
Find another goddamn writer.
There are none.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.988
They all called in sick.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.689
Of course.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.259
The lefties.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.760
Broca!

31:01.827 --> 31:03.462
Yes, Mr. Brady.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.563
Can you write?

31:04.630 --> 31:05.697
Yes, yes, I-I can write.

31:05.764 --> 31:06.933
I-I'm sure I can. Yeah.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.635
Good. Then do that.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.304
Sally?

31:14.340 --> 31:15.674
It's Uncle Pat.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.543
May I come in?

31:17.609 --> 31:19.378
No!

31:21.213 --> 31:24.016
Now, we know that you're upset,
but we've worked it all out.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.352
John's gonna do the revisions.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.519
What?

31:27.586 --> 31:30.256
He can't write, he can barely talk!

31:30.322 --> 31:31.590
Sally.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.260
Aunt Bernadette is the only
person who can write for me.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.396
She's the only person
who understands this movie.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.332
There's a whole crew of people here...
I want Aunt Bernadette!

31:42.301 --> 31:43.511
You can't just arbitrarily decide.
Would you just listen

31:43.535 --> 31:46.072
to yourself, Monroe?
I need you to meet me halfway.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.782
Perhaps if you compensated them
in a manner

31:47.806 --> 31:49.651
commensurate to their worth,
then you wouldn't have

31:49.675 --> 31:51.553
these difficulties.
We do compensate them in a manner...

31:51.577 --> 31:53.612
Who's this?

31:53.679 --> 31:55.481
Mark Brimmer,

31:55.547 --> 31:58.717
executive director of the Screen
Writers Guild of America.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.652
Nice to meet you, Brimmer.

32:00.719 --> 32:01.820
Now get the hell out.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.422
This is not a union lot.

32:03.489 --> 32:07.226
Your writers have every right
to organize, Mr. Brady.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.304
Yeah, they just organized me
out of a day of rehearsal.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.930
It was a protest. We don't
believe you have the right

32:11.998 --> 32:15.534
to arbitrarily cut the incomes
of your employees like that.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.012
It wasn't arbitrary.
It's what the studio

32:17.036 --> 32:18.537
can afford to pay right now.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.440
Meanwhile,
you're jeopardizing the jobs of people

32:21.507 --> 32:23.909
who can't afford
to be out of work like you can.

32:23.976 --> 32:26.345
The grips, costumers, drivers.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.980
That's who we're standing up for.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.315
Aubrey, please, allow me.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.117
No, allow me, Mr. Brimmer.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.319
We do compensate our writers,

32:33.385 --> 32:36.388
better than any other shop in town.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.889
Right?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.391
No?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.994
See, my problem with you is,

32:42.061 --> 32:43.662
a walkout wouldn't cost you a dime,

32:43.729 --> 32:45.897
but it would hurt their careers
immeasurably

32:45.964 --> 32:48.300
and shut down this lot. And for what?

32:48.367 --> 32:50.345
You just robbed your entire
workforce of a living wage.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.271
What are you gonna do about it?

32:52.338 --> 32:56.108
I'm going to make pictures,
and they're going to make money.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.576
And then everyone will be restored

32:57.643 --> 33:01.547
to their rightful salary
and all this will be forgotten.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.850
Until then,
we'll just have to weather this,

33:04.916 --> 33:07.953
like every other struggling
corporation in America.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.555
I hope you're ashamed of yourself.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.123
Well, shame never got a picture made.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.467
It's no time to be glib, Monroe!

33:12.491 --> 33:14.893
That's enough!

33:14.960 --> 33:16.262
You want our board of directors

33:16.328 --> 33:18.330
to yank the studio out from under us?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.766
Put this whole place into receivership?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.834
They're coming here tomorrow,

33:22.901 --> 33:25.137
and they're gonna see this place
as it's meant to be.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.473
Productive.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.411
Get back to work.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.579
Go!

33:50.229 --> 33:51.330
You Max Miner?

33:51.397 --> 33:53.332
Thank you.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.234
Next.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.436
This is terrible.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.791
Hello, princess.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.327
Oh, Daddy.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.793
Christ, you, too.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.297
I was never ashamed of my name
before today.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.632
That's a bit grand, don't you think?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.202
How are the stagehands
supposed to survive on 30% less?

34:30.268 --> 34:31.737
Or the stitchers?

34:31.803 --> 34:33.071
Or Max?

34:33.139 --> 34:34.706
Better than getting fired, isn't it?

34:34.773 --> 34:37.543
Nobody put a gun to your head
and made you pay Mayer back.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.846
Wouldn't be a bad idea
to mind your tone, darling.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.850
I am still your father.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.320
And your goddamn boss.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.556
What you,
and everybody else around here,

34:50.621 --> 34:55.025
seem to be forgetting
is that I didn't ask for this.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.795
The bank failed.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.797
So I turned to Mayer.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.433
And then I watched him
pick it apart piece by piece.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.701
If I didn't do something,

35:02.768 --> 35:04.936
eventually there'd be nothing left.

35:05.003 --> 35:07.906
And-not that it matters...
this company, this thing...

35:07.973 --> 35:10.976
that I seem to be the only one
around here protecting...

35:11.042 --> 35:12.844
will one day belong to you.

35:12.911 --> 35:17.349
And I am not leaving my daughter
an empty shell.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.190
When you're 60, you'll understand!

35:31.863 --> 35:33.265
Hey, I'm not done yet.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.804
You hear me? I'm not done yet.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.539
Yes, you are. We all are.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.874
Face it, Aubrey, we lost.

35:42.941 --> 35:47.546
We didn't lose,
we just didn't think big enough.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.751
There must be some mistake.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.388
Sorry, I seem to have the wrong stage.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.724
Damn secretaries can't keep
anything straight.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.393
You're gonna love
this Sally Sweet number, though.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.094
That kid was born to sing.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.596
We hear she's quite something.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.408
And wait till you see
the circus dog we got her.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.300
An amazingly capable animal.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.247
Damn thing could probably
do your taxes for you.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.339
Quiet out there.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.075
Like a ghost town.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.578
Just dropping by, L.B.?

37:26.645 --> 37:28.013
I guess I picked the wrong day.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.548
A walkout...

37:29.615 --> 37:32.183
on the very day the Gang of Ten
was visiting.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.687
You certainly are well-informed.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.625
Well,
people tell me things now and then.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.328
Honestly, I don't know how you do it,

37:42.394 --> 37:45.331
working so hard while he runs
the studio into the ground,

37:45.397 --> 37:46.557
constant fear of going under.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.799
Must be terrible.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.167
We manage.

37:49.234 --> 37:50.302
By the skin of your teeth.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.037
That's beneath you.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.506
What do you want?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.545
I need to replace Irving.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.547
Let's stop dancing.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.148
Come work for me, Monroe.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.384
Minor disruption?

38:05.451 --> 38:07.052
The lot is deserted.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.396
They'll come around. Believe me.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.422
If they don't...

38:10.489 --> 38:12.157
Fix it, Pat.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.461
They're just children,
throwing a tantrum to embarrass me.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.862
Well, it worked.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.230
We have a bankable hit
with Angels on the Avenue.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.566
It's a huge windfall.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.867
Yes.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.402
After Monroe saved it.

38:23.469 --> 38:27.406
And yet the studio
somehow still is a disaster.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.074
You need to get your house in order

38:29.140 --> 38:31.076
or we'll find someone who will.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.883
I run this studio.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.985
That's not what the town thinks,

38:40.051 --> 38:42.488
and neither do we.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.090
Now, your name might be over the gates,
Pat,

38:45.156 --> 38:46.625
but you know as well as I do:

38:46.692 --> 38:49.561
Monroe Stahr is Brady-American.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.030
Pat's not a storyteller.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.499
You and I both know that.

38:53.565 --> 38:57.102
Think about the pictures
that we could make.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.671
Wizard of Oz.

38:59.738 --> 39:02.908
That script was made for you.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.844
Don't you want to make things
that'll last?

39:05.911 --> 39:11.483
Pictures that people will watch
long after we're gone?

39:11.550 --> 39:14.185
You sure know how to flatter a girl,
L.B.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.087
Well, you make it easy.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.223
And he's an anchor at your feet.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.325
Yeah, sometimes...

39:20.392 --> 39:22.528
that's true.

39:23.795 --> 39:28.967
But before there was Brady-American,

39:29.034 --> 39:31.703
or even Monroe Stahr,

39:31.770 --> 39:34.540
this lot was a couple
of run-down stages,

39:34.606 --> 39:37.042
weeds coming up through the floor.

39:37.108 --> 39:42.047
Pat and I built this place... together.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.651
He made me who I am.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.187
With me you could win Oscars.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.990
You deserve that.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.161
No, L.B.

39:58.029 --> 40:03.502
When I win one for BradyAmerican,
then I'll deserve it.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.804
Mr. Stahr called.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.439
He's coming in to see you.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.040
Is he?

40:09.107 --> 40:13.479
Since when does Stahr decide
what goes on in this office?

40:13.545 --> 40:16.114
Is he running the studio now?

40:16.181 --> 40:17.849
Mr. Brady, I, uh...

40:17.916 --> 40:18.984
No!

40:19.050 --> 40:22.954
From now on, I decide when we meet.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.289
You hear me?!

40:24.355 --> 40:27.593
Mr. Stahr wants to see me,
he makes an appointment

40:27.659 --> 40:30.195
and then he sits and he waits

40:30.261 --> 40:33.364
like everybody else!

40:33.431 --> 40:36.868
Yes, Mr. Brady.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.908
My apologies, Birdy, I...

41:06.297 --> 41:08.767
Congratulations, Aubrey.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.670
For what?

41:11.737 --> 41:13.304
Well, Pat just decided.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.607
Everyone back on full salary.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.243
Well, what do you know.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.379
Sit. We'll drink to it.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.114
To solidarity. To working stiffs.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.482
Hear, hear.

41:24.550 --> 41:27.185
No, thanks.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.254
To the drink or the solidarity.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.056
Look, now Pat Brady knows:

41:31.122 --> 41:34.960
a movie lot without people on it
may as well be an airfield.

41:35.026 --> 41:38.864
I know you think you won
something today,

41:38.930 --> 41:41.066
but you don't see what you lost.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.736
Where'd he find the money?

41:44.803 --> 41:46.437
Under a mattress?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.006
No.

41:48.073 --> 41:51.677
We'll just have less operating capital.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.312
So we'll make two less movies next year,

41:54.379 --> 41:56.281
or develop a few less scripts,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.449
or Enemy gets a few less shooting days,

41:58.516 --> 41:59.751
or less money for sets,

41:59.818 --> 42:02.120
or maybe all of it. Hard to say.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.823
Doesn't matter where he found the money,
Mr. Stahr,

42:04.890 --> 42:07.559
just that he adequately paid
his workforce.

42:07.626 --> 42:10.696
News of this will spread
to other studios,

42:10.762 --> 42:14.032
across the city, the whole nation,
maybe the world,

42:14.099 --> 42:17.936
until people see that it's
the working men and women

42:18.003 --> 42:20.839
who ought to be in charge.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.107
You really believe that?

42:22.173 --> 42:25.210
You think you can start a revolution?

42:25.276 --> 42:27.545
No.

42:27.613 --> 42:31.282
But I think someone like you
very well might.

42:50.636 --> 42:53.104
She's doing well.

42:55.641 --> 42:59.177
Where will she go when she's better?

42:59.244 --> 43:01.246
A long-term facility.

43:01.312 --> 43:02.580
We usually send them to County.

43:02.648 --> 43:04.315
What if she came home with me?

43:04.382 --> 43:05.651
Sorry?

43:05.717 --> 43:08.253
I mean, when she's ready.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.723
Be a lot to take on, ma'am.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.192
She'd be completely dependent.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.327
That makes two of us.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.830
I'll be back in an hour.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.242
There you are.

43:35.647 --> 43:37.949
I have something for you.

43:46.224 --> 43:48.894
It was my mother's.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.397
She gave it to me when I left New York.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.299
"If you find a nice girl."

43:56.601 --> 43:58.269
When I proposed to Minna,

43:58.336 --> 44:02.073
I went to Brock's and bought the
biggest diamond I could find.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.010
No, she needed something showy,

44:05.076 --> 44:07.412
more than Milton Sternberg
could give her.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.582
I was gonna do the same for you,

44:11.649 --> 44:13.251
but, I don't know, this ring is...

44:13.318 --> 44:14.820
Monroe.

44:17.188 --> 44:18.690
It's beautiful.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.428
It's me.

44:25.296 --> 44:28.166
Minna thought that I could do anything,

44:28.233 --> 44:31.737
fix everything.

44:31.803 --> 44:36.441
If that's who you think you're marrying,
please, trust me.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.676
I come up short all the time.

44:38.744 --> 44:41.813
I come up short, too.

44:43.614 --> 44:46.584
I guess I've been practicing too much.

44:46.651 --> 44:48.386
All mixed up.

44:48.453 --> 44:49.855
That's all right.

44:49.921 --> 44:51.365
Wouldn't that be funny?

44:51.389 --> 44:53.158
If I talked like this all the time.

44:54.726 --> 44:58.196
Just be yourself.

44:58.263 --> 45:01.466
I love you exactly the way you are.

45:03.668 --> 45:05.536
Here, try it on.

45:17.348 --> 45:18.817
See?

45:18.884 --> 45:22.954
It fits you perfectly.

45:23.305 --> 45:29.553
