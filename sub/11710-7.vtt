10:28.419 --> 10:30.755
Journey concert.
1987 at the Garden.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.801
Went with my buddy,
Dave "The Boss" Ross.
Did you ever meet Dave?

10:34.801 --> 10:35.885
- No.
- Oh.

10:35.885 --> 10:36.678
You would've liked him.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.180
Once, he put half a bottle
of Tabasco sauce in my Nyquil.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.223
- He sounds like
a very wise man.
- Oh, he is.

10:41.223 --> 10:45.269
One time I passed out
and he shaved off
all my body hair.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.688
Start the movie.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.981
Before the concert,
we go to Charlie O's

10:48.981 --> 10:50.650
and knock back
a few cold ones.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.693
Guess who we run into?

10:51.693 --> 10:55.697
Some other knucklehead
you used to hang out with?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.406
It was crazy Jim Conroy.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.242
He once ate
a dead mouse on a bet.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.911
All right, maybe
I'll just read--

11:01.911 --> 11:03.871
Roy's goin'
to the concert too.

11:03.871 --> 11:04.831
Jim Conroy--
we called him Roy.

11:04.831 --> 11:09.585
He slaps his credit card down
and challenges us to go
shot for shot with him.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.253
I'm like,
"Line 'em up, Jimmer. "

11:11.253 --> 11:14.006
Sometimes
we'd call Roy "Jimmer."

11:14.006 --> 11:15.216
Anyway, 21 shots later--

11:15.216 --> 11:18.845
that's seven each for me,
the Boss, and Jimmer--

11:18.845 --> 11:21.638

ready to go to the show.

a little procrastinating.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.691
What do you think about
Italy for a honeymoon?

11:32.691 --> 11:36.362
Sounds good.

Well, we are, right?

11:41.658 --> 11:42.534
Yeah, yeah,

11:42.534 --> 11:44.161
but we don't have
a wedding date set,

11:44.161 --> 11:46.413
and we agreed not to worry
about the future.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.958
That's the beauty
of our relationship.

Yeah, I agree.

Italy's so romantic,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.345
Yeah, we should
take a trip.

Oh, hey, you know where
I've always wanted to go?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.350
Tahiti.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.020
Tahiti. What made you
think of that?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.980
I don't know--
I guess my old hula lamp

12:10.980 --> 12:12.481
got me thinkin'
about the islands.

12:12.481 --> 12:17.779
I just had some
ginger ale from Canada.
Maybe we should go there.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.866
Nah, nah. Canada
feels like giving up.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.994
So maybe we just
shouldn't go anywhere.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.620
Maybe we should
just stay here

12:26.620 --> 12:28.831
and keep everything
exactly as it is

12:28.831 --> 12:31.083

Or Tahiti.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.218
Hey, so what's
that thing do?

12:41.218 --> 12:44.680
To keep track of the number
of guests so it doesn't
get overcrowded.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.308
And it's not easy
because people keep going

12:47.308 --> 12:49.685
in and out and
in and out and in--

12:49.685 --> 12:51.520
Right, thank you.
Got it. Got it.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.439
Could you do me a favor
by taking this one

12:53.439 --> 12:56.650

comes in the backdoor.

our picture taken
and wind up on page six.

of a Jimmy Buffett concert.
