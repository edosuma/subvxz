WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:05.213
[both breathing heavily]

00:06.923 --> 00:08.508
Bet that burned some calories.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.094
Almost as good as a session of hot yoga.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.596
With considerably fewer wind chimes.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.150
You forgot your phone charger.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.861
Oh, leave it here for next time.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.864
Since when did you start
counting on a next time?

00:30.947 --> 00:33.241
Since the last time we went three rounds.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.576
But if you want to stop…

00:34.659 --> 00:35.660
I didn't say that.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.746
I recall you saying quite the opposite.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.331
I want you not to depend
on this being here for you,

00:40.415 --> 00:42.417
thinking you can
plug in any time you want.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.628
I'm aware that I need
the charger's consent.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.757
You need to see other women.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.717
-Why? I don't really want to…
-No excuses.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.135
If we're gonna keep hooking up,

00:52.218 --> 00:54.220
you should start sleeping
with other people.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.475
You're a very strange woman.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.272
Have you seen my phone?

01:05.315 --> 01:07.692
Oh. And remember,
we have to leave the hospital

01:07.776 --> 01:09.319
by 6:00 tonight for birthing class.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.279
The birthing class that I don't need

01:11.362 --> 01:14.032
on account of my O.B. rotation
in medical school.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.830
But where I will learn how to give you

01:20.914 --> 01:23.583
the support you need
while giving birth to our child.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.710
That is my guy.

01:29.756 --> 01:34.385
I got the results of the fetal DNA test.

01:35.678 --> 01:36.513
Okay.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.724
This will tell us the sex of the baby.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.645
I know. On account of my O.B.
rotation in medical school.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.271
Aren't you excited?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.773
Not by that.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.152
There are only two outcomes
that can be detected on this test,

01:51.236 --> 01:53.196
and I am fine with either.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.906
So am I.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.659
I'm excited to find this out.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.828
Please come here
so we can look together.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.301
It's a girl.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.804
We're having a girl.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.142
Would you like to paint
the nursery pink?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.938
No. This isn't the '50s.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.524
[chuckles]

02:29.607 --> 02:31.484
Oh! [giggles]

02:31.568 --> 02:32.735
Okay.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.237
[laughs]

02:37.157 --> 02:38.616
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.368
-I will see you in class.
-Okay.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.787
Okay. [laughs]

02:46.583 --> 02:47.709
[door closes]

02:49.419 --> 02:51.421
[theme music playing]

03:00.221 --> 03:01.639
I've got Bay 3.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.767
-The chest contusion?
-Uh-huh.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.437
Why are you all bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed over a bruise?

03:13.818 --> 03:16.446
This is Dr. Wolke. I'm Dr. Reznick.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.448
Tell me how you got that
contusion, Mister…

03:18.531 --> 03:20.408
Bradley "The Body" Vargas,

03:20.491 --> 03:22.744
currently top-ranked
in his MMA weight class.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.954
I've seen all of your fights.
You're amazing.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.458
So much for slipping in and out of here
without being recognized.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.379
Mm, sparring,
roundhouse right to the chest.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.089
Mm, that was some kick.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.175
This is a pretty large hematoma.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.176
We need to drain it.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.347
Uh, you're already training for Vazquez?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.474
That fight's not for a couple months.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.767
A real fan.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.728
Drain it? Like with a needle?

03:48.811 --> 03:50.271
We can numb you if you like.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.773
Get that away from me.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.279
Not here.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.494
[Claire] Your pre-op tests
came back normal,

04:04.577 --> 04:07.121
so we can go ahead
with the hip replacement.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.540
My physical therapist says
I should be walking

04:09.624 --> 04:13.419
four hours after surgery
and good to go in ten to 12 weeks,

04:13.503 --> 04:14.837
but I'm aiming for nine.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.130
Can you please tell my mom

04:16.214 --> 04:18.216
that that's not a good idea? [chuckles]

04:18.299 --> 04:20.593
You should not rush your recovery.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.638
Does it matter to you
whether you are having a boy or a girl?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.975
I'm having a boy.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.102
We're gonna name him Ray,
after my dad.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.189
My girlfriend and I
are going to have a daughter.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.857
That's great news, Shaun.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.651
Why?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.072
The procedure will take a couple of hours,

04:41.155 --> 04:43.449
so we should be able to
get you home in a day or two.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.077
Oh, I am looking forward
to getting back in the air,

04:46.160 --> 04:47.537
pain free.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.665
No more pills or cortisone shots or…

04:50.748 --> 04:52.041
[chuckles]

04:52.125 --> 04:53.418
…my internist telling me

04:53.501 --> 04:55.295
my hips are too wide for the cockpit.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.923
Sounds more like a Navy problem,
than a you problem.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.259
Clearly the cockpit needs a redesign…

05:01.342 --> 05:03.344
[scoffs] …as well as a renaming.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.138
-[cell phones chime]
-[chuckles]

05:05.847 --> 05:07.056
O.R. two is ready. It's time.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.481
Both implants seem to be intact.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.025
Thanks.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.277
Sorry I freaked out.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.695
Too many people back there.

05:20.778 --> 05:25.158
If my fans found out I had pec implants,
my career'd be over.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.910
I saw you make McEwan
tap in one round.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.871
Implants had nothing to do with that.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.956
My body's a big part of the brand.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.044
Everything else is real,
100% U.S. prime Bradley.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.837
You do not need to explain anything.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.547
It's just,

05:40.548 --> 05:43.009
how many guys, let alone fighters,

05:43.092 --> 05:44.343
get plastic surgery?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.220
I'm sure more than you think.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.556
When I was a kid,

05:48.639 --> 05:50.683
well, I was a big boy.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.393
I got picked on all the time.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.897
My mom wanted me to
be able to protect myself,

05:55.980 --> 05:57.482
so she put me in jiujitsu.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.485
I loved it.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.028
I started training every day.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.696
It seems to have worked.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.156
Yeah.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.241
After the fat was gone,

06:08.618 --> 06:11.120
well, man boobs don't look good on anyone.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.872
They did very nice work.

06:12.955 --> 06:13.790
I would never know.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.423
We still need to drain it.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.926
I'll get the procedure room set up.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.516
[Dr. Park] Is that why you want me
to sleep with other people?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.434
So you can shamelessly flirt
with patients?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.560
I feel no shame.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.729
And I'm not stopping you.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.648
So why do I need to see other women?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.234
This is embarrassing.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.318
For you.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.695
What man asks that question?

06:44.779 --> 06:47.031
You are soft and prone to attachment.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.033
I promise you I will not get attached.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.536
Empty words. You have
a Bumble profile. Use it.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.453
No need.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.747
What's gonna keep me
from getting attached to you

06:54.831 --> 06:56.415
isn't the charms of other women.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.126
It's your utter lack of any.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.675
[monitor beeping]

07:06.717 --> 07:08.928
[Dr. Lim] Nice osteotomy
of the femoral head.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.014
[Claire] It's bone on bone in here.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.142
I don't know how Jean pushed
through the pain.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.477
A female fighter pilot
in the "Top Gun" era?

07:16.561 --> 07:17.979
She's pushed through worse.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.315
[Shaun] Things are much better
for women today.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.987
In this surgery, I am the only man.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.074
But until they find a way
to put uteruses in men,

07:30.158 --> 07:32.368
biology will always force us
to make sacrifices

07:32.452 --> 07:33.995
our male colleagues don't.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.164
Is that why you don't have children?

07:37.123 --> 07:40.168
Shaun, that is not something
you should ever ask a woman.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.461
Well, I brought it up.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.630
I never consciously made that decision.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.966
But along the way,
I made a bunch of small ones

07:47.049 --> 07:49.844
that put my job in front of
having a family, and…

07:50.970 --> 07:52.346
I don't regret it.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.183
But it does piss me off that
most men don't have to choose.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.103
Mobilize the proximal femur,
then ream and rasp.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.819
[alarm blaring]

08:06.903 --> 08:08.946
Jean's pressure just tanked…
64 over 38.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.323
Push fluids, start pressors.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.159
Heart rate's low at 42, sinus bradycardia.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.244
Her pre-op tests were all normal.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.746
She has no cardiac history.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.706
If she threw a clot, she'd be tachy.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.041
Check for any occult bleeding.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.709
I'll get the transesophageal echo.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.630
There is no bleeding.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.633
Check a twelve-lead,
start troponins.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.134
Her B.P. is stabilizing.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.261
[alarm stops, beeping resumes]

08:35.014 --> 08:38.267
Remove osteophytes, place cup,
direct screws posterolaterally.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.311
Her pressure should not have dropped.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.730
And we don't know why it came back up.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.525
Was it the fluids and pressors
or spontaneous reversal or…

08:45.608 --> 08:47.401
We need to finish her hip arthoplasty

08:47.485 --> 08:49.320
before she bottoms out again,
and then yes,

08:49.403 --> 08:52.031
we need to figure out why it
happened in the first place.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.202
Okay.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.496
[monitor beeping]

08:58.579 --> 09:00.581
Go ahead and advance the needle.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.709
[monitor beeping]

09:06.629 --> 09:07.922
Are you seeing anybody?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.591
Oh, no. Is this about to get weird?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.260
No, I… No.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.219
[chuckles]

09:13.886 --> 09:15.346
I'm taking a flouro shot.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.559
Do you usually date
one person exclusively,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.727
or are you seeing
a few people at once?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.771
Be careful not to breach
the pleural space.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.189
Define your terms.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.317
Does "date" mean "have dinner with"

09:28.401 --> 09:30.528
or "meet up for sex"?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.573
I'm not entirely sure.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.158
Mm, by the time there's food involved,

09:36.242 --> 09:37.702
I prefer to be exclusive.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.579
In the hematoma now.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.622
[monitor beeping]

09:41.706 --> 09:44.166
Mm, I'm not able to aspirate anything.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.085
That's not just clotted blood.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.003
It's a mass.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.216
It's about five centimeters across,
firm, non-mobile.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.384
It's very dense.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.304
Get a biopsy, but that

09:58.139 --> 09:59.557
looks like breast cancer.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.441
[monitor beeping]

10:08.816 --> 10:11.777
If there's a problem with her heart,
should she be straining it?

10:11.861 --> 10:13.571
If I'm gonna have a heart attack,

10:13.654 --> 10:15.114
this is the best place for it.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.449
That is exactly right.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.367
[beeping continues]

10:19.744 --> 10:21.662
It's very likely your mom is fine,

10:21.746 --> 10:24.957
that the blood pressure drop
was just a reaction to the anesthesia.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.335
You're a very successful pilot.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.587
Was that harder
because you are a woman?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.464
For me, standing out was a plus.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.840
It got me noticed.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.760
Mm, that's not always a good thing.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.553
It's the Navy. [laughs]

10:37.637 --> 10:40.640
Was the bar higher for me
than the guys? Yeah.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.101
But pressure's just an opportunity
to get better.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.189
Your mother is very inspiring.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.611
Yes… She is.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.406
I can go harder if you need me to.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.076
Yes, please.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.540
I don't have breasts.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.793
How can I have breast cancer?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.086
You have breast tissue,

11:10.169 --> 11:12.171
and while it's rare in men,
it does happen.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.965
The biopsy has identified
a particularly aggressive tumor.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.051
But the good news is
we caught it early.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.182
[breathes deeply]

11:23.265 --> 11:24.600
W-What's next?

11:24.683 --> 11:25.893
[cellphone chimes]

11:25.976 --> 11:27.061
Sorry.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.316
We're recommending surgery
to remove the mass.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.442
Followed by chemotherapy.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.404
We don't believe there'll be any long-term
loss of strength or…

11:36.487 --> 11:38.489
Can I keep my implants?

11:38.572 --> 11:40.408
Like, will they be able to
work around them?

11:40.491 --> 11:42.743
-It's possible.
-But highly unlikely.

11:46.330 --> 11:50.251
At the end of this,
the Body gotta look like the Body.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.129
Otherwise, I'll lose my sponsors,

11:54.088 --> 11:55.297
my career.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.387
A lumpectomy makes sense
considering…

12:01.470 --> 12:04.682
If we want to let the patient
prioritize his appearance over his health.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.850
He needs a mastectomy.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.603
Would you be so dismissive if our patient
was a woman choosing to preserve her…

12:09.687 --> 12:11.939
-[cellphone chimes]
-Someone's popular today.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.441
They're all dating app alerts.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.818
It's amazing what upgrading
a profile pic can do.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.570
You should vary your password more.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.823
Where'd you get this photo?

12:23.325 --> 12:25.286
I took it for personal use.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.288
But I'm happy to let it be
your introduction

12:27.371 --> 12:28.706
to the world of e-dating.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.250
Fly, muscular sparrow.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.460
Fly.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.838
-This photo's such a…
-The words you're looking for

12:35.921 --> 12:37.756
are "thirst trap," and you're welcome.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.720
[chuckles]

12:43.596 --> 12:46.599
[Melody] <i>Relax. Relax.</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:51.312
While you are under
the soothing touch of your partner,

12:52.146 --> 12:54.732
let's discuss birthing plans.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.110
Okay, maybe just a little less pressure.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.072
-Like this?
-Uh, not really.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.035
Remember, you are in charge
of your birthing experience.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.872
Every aspect of your labor
is your decision,

13:09.955 --> 13:12.041
starting with when you head
to the hospital.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.544
Okay, maybe just stop. It's okay.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.462
It's okay.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.507
I recommend what doulas call
the 4-1-1 rule.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.009
You wait until contractions
are four minutes apart

13:22.092 --> 13:24.011
and last for one minute for at least…

13:24.094 --> 13:26.680
Five minute intervals is safer.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.141
That's one opinion, Dr. Murphy,

13:29.225 --> 13:31.852
for mothers who enjoy waiting
at the hospital.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.564
Once you arrive,
clearly instruct your partner

13:35.648 --> 13:37.316
and your doctor of what you want.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.194
No. The doctor needs to be in charge.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.612
What if there is a complication?

13:41.695 --> 13:42.696
Mm.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.615
Maybe just let her talk.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.910
[quietly] Sorry.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.663
After your water breaks,

13:50.746 --> 13:53.123
fortify yourself for the work ahead.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.752
Be that with meditation
or a pre-selected song

13:56.835 --> 13:59.463
that you find soothing
or perhaps a light snack.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.881
That is a very bad idea.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.926
Dr. Murphy, please hold
your comments until the…

14:04.009 --> 14:05.844
You shouldn't eat
after your water breaks.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.973
Many women experience bowel
incontinence during labor.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.393
[woman] Is that true?

14:12.476 --> 14:14.520
-We might poop ourselves.
-Okay.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.814
No one mentioned
involuntary pooping.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.237
[exhales sharply]

14:27.616 --> 14:29.827
-How was the class?
-Very informative.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.204
-When's the next one?
-There won't be a next one.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.706
We were thrown out.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.085
None of our tests showed any issues
with your heart.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.420
You are in great shape.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.381
Then what caused
the blood pressure drop?

14:42.464 --> 14:45.843
Mm, Dr. Browne must have been right.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.595
It was a reaction to the anesthesia.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
So, when can I get out of here?

14:49.346 --> 14:52.600
When we know you can
get around safely on your new hip.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.602
Oh.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.520
Let's do this.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.616
[exhales sharply]

15:12.411 --> 15:13.454
[exhales sharply]

15:13.996 --> 15:15.497
Careful, Mom. It's not a race.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.292
Everything's a race, dear.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.712
[echoing] Mom!

15:25.841 --> 15:27.843
[dramatic music plays]

15:34.224 --> 15:37.353
Jean's hip is intact,
which means it didn't cause her fall.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.813
No, her blood pressure did.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.107
Jean was still being monitored
when she collapsed.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.818
Her blood pressure fell precipitously,
just like in surgery.

15:46.153 --> 15:50.658
Sudden hypotensive crisis
could be a high spinal cord tumor.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.409
Or carotid stenosis,

15:52.493 --> 15:54.745
or carotid sinus hypersensitivity.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.414
Endocrine deficiency?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.751
Make a list. Start ruling things out.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.881
Uh.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.302
make a list somewhere else.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.777
Shaun!

16:28.612 --> 16:30.114
Come meet Theresa.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.201
She's a doula, and we're talking about
her helping me during my labor.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.869
Hello.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.080
Lea does not need a doula.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.499
I will be helping her.
But thank you.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.920
Let me know what you decide.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.422
Of course. Thank you.

16:52.970 --> 16:57.057
Shaun, I am so excited about our baby.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.435
And I am so scared
about delivering her.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.645
It's gonna hurt.
It could go on for hours.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.855
Possibly over a day.

17:03.605 --> 17:07.276
And I need to know that I can
have whatever I need,

17:07.359 --> 17:10.320
a massage at exactly
the right pressure…

17:10.404 --> 17:13.699
-Mm.
-…a hand to squeeze really hard,

17:13.782 --> 17:15.617
a cool, wet washcloth.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.618
Oh.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.495
Or a warm, wet washcloth.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.580
Oh.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.082
Can you do that?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.837
I can get better at massages.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.922
I'm sure you can,

17:29.214 --> 17:32.134
but those aren't really
your strengths, are they?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.724
It's… just a set-up for failure,

17:38.807 --> 17:41.018
and I know neither of us wants that.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.773
No. We don't.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.399
Yeah.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.491
[Heather] Dr. Park.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.160
Dr. Boyd.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.746
I definitely do not know this

18:00.829 --> 18:03.457
because it's completely confidential,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.168
but hypothetically, if you were treating

18:06.251 --> 18:10.297
MMA rockstar Bradley Vargas,
and if I had a ten-year-old patient

18:10.380 --> 18:12.966
who would go bananas
for a signed photo…

18:13.717 --> 18:14.968
I'll see what I can do.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.680
Thanks in advance for the autograph.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.265
It'll make a ten-year-old's day.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.024
-No.
-What?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.150
She's all wrong.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.278
She's a Pedes resident.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.406
They're all kind and nurturing
and they care about things,

18:36.490 --> 18:39.701
and she obviously wants you to keep
all your chargers at her house.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.163
That's not what you need. You need fun.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.164
Text the redhead.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.085
-What redhead?
-Candace309.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.003
[keyboard clacking]

18:50.629 --> 18:52.673
Change your password
to something I can't guess.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.591
[keyboard clacking]

18:59.179 --> 19:03.350
No tumors in the frontal
or parietal lobes.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.686
Next we should check
for a glial-based tumor

19:05.769 --> 19:06.979
in the brain stem.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.730
Squeeze my hand
as hard as you can.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.946
Lea said she may need to
do that during labor.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.531
I want to be prepared.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.083
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.171
We need a better look
in the high cervical cord.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.341
Is Lea feeling nervous about labor?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.679
She thinks she needs
a doula to support her, but she doesn't.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.556
You squeezed my hand very hard.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.099
I can take it.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.392
Mm, I think there's probably

19:45.475 --> 19:47.686
gonna be more to it than that, Shaun.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.523
I've also looked into
antimicrobial options

19:51.607 --> 19:53.567
for washcloths, to wipe her forehead.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.570
What else?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.698
I don't know.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.535
Neither do you, or Lea,
or the doctor, or the doula…

20:03.619 --> 20:05.370
That's what's terrifying about it.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.624
It's the biggest day of your life,

20:08.707 --> 20:10.542
and the only thing you know for sure

20:10.626 --> 20:13.378
is that another human is gonna
force its way out of you.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.887
High cervical cord is clear.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.980
Breathe.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.649
[exhales slowly]

20:33.732 --> 20:35.025
[breathing shakily]

20:35.108 --> 20:36.777
Good. You're almost there.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.238
The lighting in this room is very harsh.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.531
We didn't call for a surgical consult,
Dr. Murphy.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.533
I know. I'm here for research.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.743
Well, this is a bad time.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.662
Next contraction, I need you to push.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.621
Okay.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.040
I am very interested
in anything you can share

20:50.123 --> 20:51.583
about your experience.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.211
-[exhales sharply]
-What are you feeling right now?

20:54.294 --> 20:57.381
Like… Oh, like he's trying to…

20:57.464 --> 21:00.092
Oh, rip out everything!

21:01.301 --> 21:03.262
Do you wish you had gotten an epidural?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.429
Yes!

21:05.430 --> 21:06.515
It's too late now.

21:06.974 --> 21:07.975
[groans]

21:10.852 --> 21:12.479
Please page Dr. Glassman.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.358
[breathing shakily]

21:21.530 --> 21:23.198
Lea wants to have a doula.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.036
Okay, and, uh, you don't?

21:28.704 --> 21:31.123
Research shows that
doula-assisted births

21:31.206 --> 21:33.542
have fewer complications,
decreased length of labor,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.294
and increased breastfeeding rates.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.754
So, you do want a doula?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.965
N-No.

21:40.048 --> 21:43.969
I can precisely measure
the time between contractions

21:44.052 --> 21:46.513
and get the right washcloths
and I've mapped out

21:46.596 --> 21:48.223
the fastest route from the OB floor

21:48.307 --> 21:50.309
to the cafeteria for ice chips.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.603
I don't want Lea to have a doula.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.692
But… they are good.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.989
I am very bad at massages.

22:07.409 --> 22:11.830
So, you… You want Lea
to have everything that she wants,

22:11.913 --> 22:15.584
but you don't want her
to want a doula?

22:15.667 --> 22:16.668
Yes.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.463
How do I do that?

22:19.546 --> 22:20.714
I don't know.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.883
I just… [chuckles]

22:22.966 --> 22:24.259
It can't be done.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.803
It's like you…
You want a red shirt really badly,

22:26.887 --> 22:28.388
but it has to be green.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.101
Why can't you just give her
what she needs?

22:36.354 --> 22:37.355
Hm.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.234
Okay.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.402
Good.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.490
[Dr. Andrews] We need to expose
the underlying pec major.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.409
Dr. Park, gently cut
with microdissection needle.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.287
Mm. I really need to join a gym.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.582
I mean, I know I'm never gonna
look like "The Body,"

22:55.665 --> 22:59.503
but I could try to look like
I have a body. [chuckles]

23:02.130 --> 23:05.634
Raise the flap and be careful
not to thin it too much.

23:06.676 --> 23:09.429
Bradley's transformation is impressive,
but it's not real.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.266
Strength, determination, hard work…
those things are real,

23:13.350 --> 23:14.726
and worth striving for.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.311
Not to the exclusion of all else.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.232
The day I lost my job as Chief,

23:20.315 --> 23:23.819
I went home and drank myself
to sleep every night for a week.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.988
Better to drown my sorrows
than to let my wife see me cry.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.866
When your marriage fell apart,
did you tell a good friend

23:29.950 --> 23:32.494
that you were heartbroken,
or did you just hit something

23:32.577 --> 23:34.204
really hard for a long time?

23:36.498 --> 23:39.376
Both are fine, but men don't do both.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.464
I'm guessing no one told you
you were a "real man"

23:44.548 --> 23:46.842
when you came out,
but that took a lot more courage

23:46.925 --> 23:49.052
than getting pummeled
inside of an octagon.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.687
I can't see any clear tumor margins.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.481
The tumor extends beyond
what was visible on imaging.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.817
It was obscured by the pec implant.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.904
Close him up.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.533
We need to wake him and get his consent
for a total mastectomy.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.247
I can't go home yet.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.374
I still don't know
what's wrong with my patient.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.209
Then why did you ask me to wait?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.669
This is for you.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.261
Oh. Okay.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.514
This will massage your shoulders
whenever you want

24:34.598 --> 24:36.933
at exactly the right pressure.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.186
There are three settings
and a pulsing option,

24:39.269 --> 24:40.854
which I think would be irritating,

24:40.937 --> 24:42.355
but it is up to you.

24:42.439 --> 24:46.109
When I wear this, you can
squeeze as hard as you want.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.738
Also, I have been building up
my washcloth tolerance.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.531
I am up to 15 seconds.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.327
That's great, Shaun.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.331
But I decided I want Theresa
there for the birth.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.251
It'll make me feel safer
and more comfortable.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.422
I… can make you feel safe
and comfortable.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.345
I am the father.
I am going to be a good father.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.930
I know that, and I believe that.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.848
You don't need her.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.519
Maybe not, but I want her there.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.940
It's my body and my birth experience,

25:25.023 --> 25:27.150
and I want to have
a doula there with me,

25:27.234 --> 25:28.526
so we're gonna have one.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.449
I love you.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.993
I'll see you at home.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.503
[woman on TV] <i>…less than two weeks away,</i>
<i>so don't get too comfortable.</i>

25:46.586 --> 25:48.630
The brain and spinal MRI scans were clear.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.756
You don't have a tumor.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.301
[sighs] One less thing to worry about.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.345
What's left?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.430
There is still a very long list.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.641
I need to perform a carotid sinus massage

25:59.724 --> 26:01.559
to test for hypersensitivity.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.814
I have been working on
my massage technique,

26:05.897 --> 26:06.982
but you may pass out.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.611
That's how we know
if the test worked.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.531
Elongate your neck and turn your head
ten degrees away from me.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.375
Did you have a doula
when you gave birth?

26:25.458 --> 26:27.085
[chuckles]

26:27.168 --> 26:29.713
No one I know had a doula back then.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.966
Or fancy birthing suites
or hypno-breathing

26:33.049 --> 26:35.969
or the luxury of
three months off to recover.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.308
It's not a luxury, Mom.

26:41.808 --> 26:45.228
It's important for the mom and the baby.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.400
If women wanna compete,
then compete.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.403
[chuckles] We can't ask
for special treatment

26:53.486 --> 26:56.197
and then complain that
the playing field isn't level.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.284
I got a long weekend,
and then back in the plane.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.286
I didn't have a choice.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.331
You had a choice.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.291
Stop breathing, please.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.338
You always loved to fly.

27:12.505 --> 27:15.467
Maybe more than being stuck on the ground
with me and Dad.

27:16.801 --> 27:17.635
No.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.515
-Okay.
-[exhales sharply]

27:24.142 --> 27:26.186
I didn't like leaving either one of you.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.026
I just wanted you to see me be strong

27:33.109 --> 27:35.195
so you knew you could be strong, too.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.615
I did.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.538
Being scared and weak,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.665
I wasn't always sure if that was okay.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.048
-[alarm beeping]
-Oh, my God.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.675
Wait, is this what was supposed to happen?

27:57.759 --> 27:59.886
No. This is not supposed to happen.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.097
[beeping continues]

28:11.189 --> 28:13.525
-[exhales sharply]
-You need a total mastectomy,

28:13.608 --> 28:15.443
including the removal
of your pec implant.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.071
But with training,
your strength should fully…

28:18.154 --> 28:21.574
I can't get back in the octagon
with half my chest caved in.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.994
-I'll lose my sponsors.
-Then find new ones.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.038
Once people know
what you've been through…

28:27.122 --> 28:30.625
You honestly think I'm gonna let
anyone know I had breast cancer?

28:32.544 --> 28:34.879
What about non-surgical options?

28:34.963 --> 28:36.089
What about chemo?

28:36.172 --> 28:38.133
Chemo alone isn't the best way
to treat this.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.552
It doesn't have to be the best.
It just has to work.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.886
There's no guarantee it will,

28:41.970 --> 28:44.681
given the tumor's invasiveness,
they'll have to use toxic…

28:44.764 --> 28:47.183
I can take whatever you throw at me.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.729
But I'm not having surgery.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.195
EEG results are normal.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.658
You've never had a seizure before,

29:03.742 --> 29:06.077
but it's possible one was missed.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.537
There are many different types.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.708
Does Jean ever stare off,
become non-responsive?

29:11.791 --> 29:12.876
No.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.627
No.

29:14.711 --> 29:18.631
But there was that one
"bathroom episode"?

29:19.257 --> 29:22.177
When I came to stay with you,
after Dad died.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.470
Oh, that was nothing.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.015
It was late and she
fell asleep watching TV.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.642
She got up to use the bathroom
and got light-headed

29:29.726 --> 29:31.144
and then almost fainted.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.855
I think I was just exhausted.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.982
Did it happen again?

29:36.065 --> 29:37.484
Uh, hardly ever.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.986
A couple times, over the last few years.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.616
There is no mention of this
in your medical record.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.326
I told my internist.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.870
He said it happens to
some women during menopause.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.998
Have you experienced other symptoms

29:52.081 --> 29:54.375
that were attributed to menopause?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.044
Of course.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.463
Tell me what they are
and when they started.

29:58.546 --> 30:02.258
Um, I think I had some
constipation and sleep issues.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.094
-When? How long?
-I-I-I don't know.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.471
I don't remember.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.682
I-I told my doctor,
and he told me not to worry about it.

30:09.766 --> 30:13.102
He told me to forget about it, so I did.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.200
[telephone ringing]

30:30.537 --> 30:31.538
Mrs. Williams.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.167
I have an urgent problem
I have to talk to you about.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.253
You'll need to wait your turn, Mr., uh…

30:38.336 --> 30:40.213
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.006
I need answers about Jean Starzak.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.008
She was your patient.
Now she is my patient.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.011
Dr. Murphy, if you can wait,
we can talk in private.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.596
Okay. Yes.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.598
You failed to chart many
of Jean's symptoms,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.183
constipation, sleep disturbances,

30:52.267 --> 30:53.601
hot flashes, reduced libido.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.228
She doesn't remember
all her symptoms

30:55.311 --> 30:57.230
or when they began,
so we cannot figure out

30:57.313 --> 30:58.439
what is wrong with her.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.400
Sounds to me like
she's in menopause.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.695
You're a talented diagnostician,
Mrs. Williams.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.738
No. She's not.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.449
Menopause doesn't explain
her recent blood pressure issues.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.784
Mrs. Starzak's chart, please.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.077
It's not in there.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.122
And she mentioned
several episodes of nighttime dizziness,

31:14.205 --> 31:15.832
which I believe were seizures.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.626
What is in here is enough
to remind me that

31:18.710 --> 31:20.461
the dizziness was menopause.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.131
Micturition syncope, not seizures.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.676
And the blood pressure issue isn't new.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.513
But also isn't a symptom of anything

31:30.597 --> 31:32.640
besides her anxiety
about forced retirement.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.684
It wasn't…

31:36.019 --> 31:38.771
I know it happened during surgery.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.482
She wasn't anxious.
She was unconscious.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.238
My daughter is never coming to see you.

32:04.422 --> 32:07.508
According to this piece in
"Clinical Endocrinology",

32:07.592 --> 32:10.553
Jean's symptoms match pretty well
with Addison's disease.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.972
She doesn't have hyperpigmentation,

32:13.056 --> 32:14.557
or weight loss.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.644
-Not all cases presented with…
-Cortisol levels are normal.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.480
There have been several
recent case studies

32:20.563 --> 32:24.108
correlating hypothyroidism
with low post-op BP.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.694
Jean's TSH is borderline high.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.448
But her thyroid hormone
is in the normal range.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.162
What about sleep apnea?

32:36.663 --> 32:38.790
I read about a case involving BP crashes.

32:38.873 --> 32:39.916
That's interesting.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.627
Mm, Jean's body type
isn't typical with apnea,

32:42.710 --> 32:44.087
but we could ask about snoring.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.589
I would like to see that case literature.

32:47.715 --> 32:51.719
It's not a conventional case write-up.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.306
I saw a post on Reddit.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.391
Mm.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.066
What subgroup?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.568
The women's health community.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.113
Mm. It's not scientific.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.366
At all. It's not helpful.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.993
But neither is this.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.285
There is nothing here.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.580
The medical establishment
isn't looking into this stuff.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.249
It's ignored women like Jean,

33:21.332 --> 33:23.167
as demonstrated by her own doctor

33:23.251 --> 33:24.711
not charting her symptoms.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.630
That is true, but is still a bad idea

33:27.714 --> 33:29.716
to rely on anecdotal evidence.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.883
I agree with you.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.219
If you have a better idea,
I am happy to go with it.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.102
Keep checking Reddit.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.815
Claire, can you look
at social media postings?

33:47.191 --> 33:49.027
I'll check out the blogs.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.742
You changed your profile picture.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.618
-It sucks.
-It looks like me.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.495
It's not like I photoshopped your head

33:59.579 --> 34:00.705
on someone else's body.

34:00.788 --> 34:01.956
If I'm gonna sell myself,

34:02.040 --> 34:04.000
I at least want to sell
who I actually am.

34:04.083 --> 34:07.253
The women who answer your posts
don't care who you actually are.

34:07.336 --> 34:11.049
And based on this photo,
I don't think you know who you are.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.550
You're reading Proust?

34:12.633 --> 34:14.469
[Bradley vomiting]

34:17.221 --> 34:20.850
Once the ondansetron kicks in,
you should start feeling better.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.977
Just in time
for your next chemo session.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.438
[clears throat, sniffles]

34:25.855 --> 34:26.856
[sighs]

34:28.733 --> 34:30.068
I'll get through it.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.320
I know you will.

34:35.531 --> 34:36.741
Doesn't mean you should.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.287
It's dumb.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.625
You're acting like an idiot
because you're less afraid

34:45.708 --> 34:49.462
of months of pain and nausea
than being exposed.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.842
You've constructed a perfect facade,

34:55.510 --> 34:57.929
and you're gonna kill yourself
trying to preserve it.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.475
But being strong
has nothing to do with being "The Body."

35:02.850 --> 35:04.268
Tell that to my fans.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.062
My sponsors.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.399
I think you should.

35:12.735 --> 35:15.571
Tell them none of this makes you a man.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.575
You were just as brave and strong

35:19.659 --> 35:21.828
back when you were a fat,
bullied little kid

35:21.911 --> 35:24.038
that decided to make a change.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.874
That kid didn't let other people tell him

35:26.958 --> 35:29.585
who he could be
or what he was capable of.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.882
Don't let him down now.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.315
Schedule the surgery.

36:13.713 --> 36:17.717
This woman says she had
chronic low blood pressure

36:17.800 --> 36:20.636
and her doctors blamed it
on her "weight loss obsession".

36:21.345 --> 36:23.389
Turned out she had
congestive heart failure.

36:24.849 --> 36:29.812
This woman's seizures were
attributed to her pregnancy.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.731
She was on her fourth doctor

36:31.814 --> 36:34.275
before they correctly
diagnosed her epilepsy.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.860
[Claire] I got something.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.947
This woman spent years
with the same symptoms as Jean,

36:40.031 --> 36:41.782
before she was diagnosed.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.163
Parkinson's Disease.

36:57.798 --> 37:00.676
You're healing well.
Pathology results show clean margins.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.595
You should regain
full strength and be back

37:02.678 --> 37:04.513
in the octagon in a few months.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.641
Thank you.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.728
There's something I wanna show you.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.944
"My Next Fight is Breast Cancer."

37:19.612 --> 37:23.366
Over a million views,
with some very encouraging comments.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.826
A few you will want to mute.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.161
[chuckles]

37:28.329 --> 37:31.415
And a bunch of women
who are really into scars.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.181
The test confirms you have
Parkinson's Disease.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.852
[Claire] We believe it's been
progressing for a few years.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.981
Your hip pain may well
have been the first indicator.

37:59.777 --> 38:00.903
Can I still fly?

38:00.987 --> 38:02.196
I'm afraid not.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.458
How do we treat it?

38:14.542 --> 38:17.545
Unfortunately, the delay in diagnosis

38:17.628 --> 38:19.797
has allowed the symptoms to intensify,

38:19.880 --> 38:23.134
and there is nothing
we can do to reverse that.

38:23.217 --> 38:27.221
You should still have several
more years of decent mobility,

38:27.305 --> 38:31.142
and we can help
manage the symptoms with medication.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.230
We'll let you two have some time alone.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.578
I'd like to go home.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.622
Can you, uh…

38:55.666 --> 38:57.793
Can you see about getting me discharged?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.134
Tory, please go.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.764
No, Mom.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.315
It's okay.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.867
[sobbing]

39:55.976 --> 39:57.228
How's your phone battery?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.146
'Cause there's a charger at my place.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.233
It's time to retire that metaphor.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.651
I'm busy.

40:05.152 --> 40:05.986
You were right.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.656
I'm attachment-prone,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.242
As long as I'm with someone
who feels the same way.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.743
[Heather] I found the place.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.870
Flannigans.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.664
Oysters. Overpriced IPAs.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.666
The game on three big screens.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.584
-[elevator bell dings]
-Perfect.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.841
See you tomorrow.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.523
I want our daughter to have the chance

40:42.606 --> 40:46.527
to have everything she wants,
and I want you to have

40:46.610 --> 40:48.821
the chance to have everything you want.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.739
But I can't.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.827
Not by myself.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.922
It's okay that I am bad at massages.

41:07.923 --> 41:09.133
She will handle them.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.760
Thank you.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.766
How do you two feel
about frankincense oil?

41:17.850 --> 41:18.851
Um…

41:19.685 --> 41:20.895
[exhales sharply]

41:22.521 --> 41:24.356
No thanks. [chuckles]

41:29.737 --> 41:30.738
Lea,

41:34.450 --> 41:37.953
the world is harder for women.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.041
I want to change that,
but I don't know how.

41:45.753 --> 41:49.381
By being an amazing dad
to our daughter.

41:50.382 --> 41:53.969
By letting her know that
she's loved and supported.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.680
We'll raise her to be strong.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.143
Like you.

42:21.580 --> 42:22.998
[imperceptible conversation]

42:31.882 --> 42:33.884
[closing theme music playing]
