<i>chicken that lay 16 eggs a day,</i>

00:21.213 --> 00:23.163
<i>which is a lot for a chicken.</i>

00:45.161 --> 00:48.638
When you run a research and development department
for one of the largest companies in America,

00:48.673 --> 00:51.421
every day brings exciting new problems
waiting to be solved.

00:51.456 --> 00:52.994
- Ted.
- Veronica.

00:53.145 --> 00:55.808
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Why?

00:56.214 --> 00:58.554
I was just seeing what small talk
might look like.

00:58.589 --> 00:59.890
Oh. Well, usually you--

00:59.925 --> 01:02.354
Please stop. I feel like I just
pissed away my day.

01:02.389 --> 01:03.401
We have a problem.

01:03.436 --> 01:06.431
The food division just told me that the
"extra fun mac and cheese"

01:06.466 --> 01:08.184
I'm supposed to be presenting
to the shareholders

01:08.219 --> 01:10.631
causes blindness if eaten more
than twice a week.

01:10.666 --> 01:13.296
Plus, no matter how long it's cooked,
it never gets hot.

01:13.331 --> 01:15.358
Maybe it's not mac and cheese.

01:15.393 --> 01:18.077
Oh, no. It has to be. They've
already designed the box.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.206
Anyway, I need a new food product
I can unveil next week.

01:21.241 --> 01:25.221
Something splashy, sexy.
The opposite of small talk.

01:25.473 --> 01:27.673
Okay. Well, I'll--
I'll see what we have.

01:27.743 --> 01:30.243
Your hair looks nice like that, by the way.

01:30.921 --> 01:33.002
- It's small talk.
- Oh.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.123
I liked it that time.

01:42.724 --> 01:44.024
<i>This is Linda.</i>

01:45.549 --> 01:46.768
<i>She's great.</i>

01:49.016 --> 01:52.153
<i>But sometimes she gets
frustrated working here...</i>

01:52.883 --> 01:54.225
<i>Which is understandable.</i>

01:54.260 --> 01:56.301
So we looked at what we
have in the pipeline,

01:56.336 --> 01:59.503
and the only food product that's close
to ready is Lem and Phil's project--

01:59.538 --> 02:01.189
beef grown without cows.

02:01.224 --> 02:02.752
Beef without cows?

02:02.787 --> 02:03.890
I'm listening.

02:03.925 --> 02:07.959
We take bovine cells and, surrounding
them in a bed of rich nutrients,

02:07.994 --> 02:11.212
grow them into fully developed
cow tissue, or "beef."

02:11.247 --> 02:13.734
- Cowless meat grown in a lab.
- I just said that.

02:13.769 --> 02:16.282
- I'm explaining it.
- No, you're repeating it.

02:16.317 --> 02:17.567
No, Lem, I'm...

02:21.639 --> 02:24.130
That's something Phil's been
doing a lot of lately.

02:24.165 --> 02:27.897
The company's legal department has come up with
a few theories as to why it's been happening.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.542
<i>One idea is Phil may have
been traumatized</i>

02:31.577 --> 02:34.320
<i>by burning his finger
on a chicken potpie.</i>

02:34.611 --> 02:38.411
<i>Another theory is that it's
an old football injury.</i>

02:43.318 --> 02:48.209
<i>Personally, I think it's because the company
tried to cryonically freeze him for a year...</i>

02:50.110 --> 02:53.510
<i>And then accidentally thawed
him out a few days later.</i>

03:09.055 --> 03:10.507
Did I do it again?

03:10.542 --> 03:13.232
Yes. It seems like it may be getting louder.

03:14.219 --> 03:16.769
- How did I get wet?
- No one knows.

03:17.387 --> 03:19.018
Perhaps you urinated.

03:19.323 --> 03:20.673
In my face?

03:22.163 --> 03:23.686
Sorry I'm late.

03:24.391 --> 03:27.498
The new bathroom towel dispenser
is an incredible jerk.

03:27.533 --> 03:30.151
We're talking about growing meat
in the lab without cows.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.727
Oh, that's creepy.

03:34.604 --> 03:35.604
Right?

03:37.724 --> 03:39.320
Oh, I see. We're doing that.

03:39.355 --> 03:42.396
Yes, we are, and we have five days
to make it happen.

03:43.363 --> 03:44.813
Clean yourself up.

03:52.742 --> 03:56.056
At least meat grown in a test
tube doesn't feel pain.

03:56.091 --> 03:57.593
Please tell me it doesn't feel pain.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.698
- We don't think so.
- Yeah, although interestingly,

03:59.733 --> 04:01.883
it does respond to music.

04:06.140 --> 04:09.855
<i>Lately there's been a little tension
in Phil and Lem's relationship.</i>

04:09.890 --> 04:12.127
Once again, your attempt
to feed the meat blob

04:12.162 --> 04:14.597
is being hindered by your
ridiculous use of mittens.

04:14.632 --> 04:17.209
Sometimes my hands get cold in the lab.

04:17.245 --> 04:18.543
Because you froze yourself.

04:18.577 --> 04:21.077
- Could we not talk about that for one day?
- Fine.

04:21.113 --> 04:22.963
I'll feed the meat blob.

04:26.031 --> 04:28.681
Blobby. Like bobby,
only with an "L".

04:28.796 --> 04:30.867
Don't name it, or you won't
want to eat it.

04:30.902 --> 04:33.202
- Remember Chester the carrot?
- Yeah.

04:34.886 --> 04:36.189
I miss him.

04:44.019 --> 04:45.756
You're stealing more creamer?

04:45.791 --> 04:47.780
It took me 20 minutes to dry
my hands this morning,

04:47.815 --> 04:49.806
so I am owed 20 minutes of creamer.

04:49.841 --> 04:52.250
- And how much is that?
- It's an infinite amount.

04:55.622 --> 04:56.970
I know it doesn't make sense,

04:57.005 --> 05:00.999
but this small act of rebellion
keeps me sane, calm.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.367
- There's no creamer down the hall. Do you--
- No!

05:07.701 --> 05:09.751
You want me to be calm, don't you?

05:09.837 --> 05:11.398
Yeah, I-I do.

05:11.701 --> 05:14.050
I really do. When does that start?

05:19.856 --> 05:22.750
- We should stop smiling at each other.
- I know.

05:22.978 --> 05:26.099
I wish you didn't have your stupid
one-office-affair rule

05:26.134 --> 05:28.935
and that you hadn't used your
one office affair so stupidly.

05:33.525 --> 05:37.670
And I wish you hadn't called me stupid
twice in one sentence, but here we are.

05:38.711 --> 05:40.333
It's just... Veronica.

05:40.368 --> 05:42.590
- Well, it doesn't matter who it was with--
- Linda.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.297
I have to get back to work.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.863
I don't see the appeal, but whatever.

05:49.472 --> 05:51.578
Why is there never any creamer?

05:51.613 --> 05:53.411
Ants. No, ghosts.

05:53.446 --> 05:55.139
No. I don't know.

05:55.669 --> 05:56.996
I have a problem, Ted.

05:57.031 --> 06:00.304
Legal is worried that Phil might
think his annoying outbursts

06:00.339 --> 06:02.774
are connected to our
allegedly freezing him.

06:02.809 --> 06:04.883
We didn't "allegedly" freeze
him. We froze him,

06:04.918 --> 06:06.868
like a human leftover.

06:07.008 --> 06:11.084
Legal says we don't know for sure what
that chamber was that he entered willingly.

06:11.119 --> 06:15.282
The latest theory is that he may have been
attempting to perform a magic trick.

06:15.317 --> 06:18.917
Oh, yeah, that magic trick where
the company freezes him.

06:18.952 --> 06:21.543
The point is, they are not comfortable
with him working on

06:21.578 --> 06:23.872
new projects until we know
he's not gonna sue us

06:23.907 --> 06:26.721
for whatever did or probably
did not happen.

06:26.756 --> 06:29.908
But without Phil, this meat project
isn't gonna happen.

06:29.943 --> 06:31.545
But I need the meat project.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.499
- Then you need Phil.
- But we can't use Phil.

06:33.534 --> 06:35.847
- Then you can't have the meat project.
- But I need the meat project.

06:35.882 --> 06:38.932
- Then you need Phil.
- But I can't use Phil.

06:41.799 --> 06:44.049
You prefer this to small talk?

06:44.223 --> 06:45.571
Why does it have to be Phil?

06:45.606 --> 06:48.329
Can't we just give this to another
team of lab drones?

06:48.364 --> 06:51.285
Veronica, Phil and Lem are
the best scientists we have.

06:51.435 --> 06:52.679
Hey, Phil, would you take
a look at this?

06:52.714 --> 06:55.573
<i>It's true. Together, there's
nothing those guys can't do.</i>

06:55.608 --> 06:59.258
<i>They pioneered retinal
scan technology...</i>

07:02.846 --> 07:04.285
Nice.

07:06.770 --> 07:10.070
<i>Developed the next generation
of pepper spray.</i>

07:15.655 --> 07:18.855
<i>They're even the best dancers
at the Christmas party.</i>

07:22.402 --> 07:25.215
Fine, they're the best, but we can't use
them because we can't use Phil.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.887
And don't say I can't have the meat.

07:26.922 --> 07:28.822
Okay, how about this--

07:29.250 --> 07:31.841
Instead of putting Phil out to pasture,

07:32.119 --> 07:35.969
why don't we try to make him feel good
about what he did?

07:36.282 --> 07:37.600
Because...

07:37.918 --> 07:38.994
Help me.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.997
Phil did something that no one else ever has.

07:42.032 --> 07:43.432
That took courage.

07:43.472 --> 07:46.164
If we help him realize
he's a hero, which he is,

07:46.199 --> 07:48.573
he might look at the experience
more fondly. Plus,

07:48.608 --> 07:51.508
he's a good guy. It's the
right thing to do.

07:52.259 --> 07:55.016
- I'm still not--
- Then he won't sue the company.

07:57.759 --> 08:00.184
Fine. We'll honor Phil.

08:00.698 --> 08:02.348
But he owes me.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.183
Yeah.

08:06.677 --> 08:08.702
<i>The next day, we honored Phil</i>

08:08.737 --> 08:10.677
<i>because it was the right thing to do</i>

08:10.712 --> 08:12.237
<i>and because a happy scientist</i>

08:12.272 --> 08:15.276
<i>is a non-suing, cowless-meat-
making scientist.</i>

08:15.311 --> 08:18.542
And so for bravely pushing back
the boundaries of science,

08:18.577 --> 08:20.558
on behalf of Veridian Dynamics,

08:20.593 --> 08:22.043
I thank you, Phil,

08:22.284 --> 08:25.877
and present you with our first ever
"Trailblazer of the year" award.

08:33.395 --> 08:36.490
I've never been in the executive
dining room before. It's nice.

08:36.525 --> 08:39.270
Well, now you can have lunch
here anytime you want.

08:39.755 --> 08:42.205
- Thank you.
- For the next week.

08:44.295 --> 08:45.620
Cryonics.

08:46.099 --> 08:49.659
The first syllable is "cry", so how
great can it be? Am I right?

08:53.495 --> 08:57.534
Anyway, I thought, if I
can advance science...

09:03.655 --> 09:07.350
What a treat. Do you hear that noise
coming from our hero?

09:08.335 --> 09:11.571
That is the sound of courage,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:11.924 --> 09:13.949
It's like an eagle screech.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.847
And I can't hear it enough.

09:15.905 --> 09:17.995
And neither can any of you.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.010
What was the executive
dining room like?

09:31.045 --> 09:34.189
Oh, yes, please. I never get tired
of hearing that story.

09:34.224 --> 09:37.750
So there are tables, right,
with legs to hold 'em up?

09:37.785 --> 09:39.702
Hey, do the eagle scream.

09:40.495 --> 09:44.397
Oh, I can't just do it, Lonny.
It has to ease out of me.

09:44.454 --> 09:47.510
Like a bowel movement, only
louder and from his mouth.

09:47.545 --> 09:51.650
Okay, you know what?
I am a "Trailblazer", Lem.

09:51.685 --> 09:54.730
My picture is on the front page
of the company newsletter.

09:54.765 --> 09:59.702
I am the "Below zero hero".
Julie in employee services

09:59.737 --> 10:03.758
asked for my autograph. That's right.
Julie, with those breasts in front.

10:03.995 --> 10:07.436
It's a new Phil, Lem. You had
better get used to it.

10:09.355 --> 10:11.486
Wow. That was super aggressive.

10:18.635 --> 10:21.110
We've got four days, Ted.
Where are we on the lab meat?

10:21.145 --> 10:24.270
Great. I'm on my way to Jerome
to have it taste-tested right now.

10:24.305 --> 10:26.950
Jerome? Isn't he still in the hospital from
the "extra fun mac and cheese"?

10:26.985 --> 10:28.580
No, he got his eyesight back.

10:28.615 --> 10:32.160
They just had scrape some of the
"extra fun" off of his optic nerve.

10:32.195 --> 10:35.445
What the hell keeps happening
with the creamer?

10:38.755 --> 10:40.370
You have to stop stealing creamer.

10:40.405 --> 10:42.544
- No. Is Blobby inside?
- Yes.

10:42.835 --> 10:44.685
And we're not calling it Blobby.

10:44.915 --> 10:47.779
You know, 'cause of Chester?
The carrot.

10:49.442 --> 10:52.818
- They're going to catch you.
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.863
Hi, Jerome.
How you feeling?

10:55.164 --> 10:58.764
Better, thanks. Though I still
can't see green.

10:59.105 --> 11:01.594
- What do we have today?
- You tell us.

11:04.555 --> 11:08.084
If they catch you, they're gonna fire you.
And if they fire you, well...

11:08.415 --> 11:09.889
You won't be here anymore.

11:10.795 --> 11:15.238
I know, but if I stop, I feel like
I'll be giving up a piece of my soul.

11:15.273 --> 11:17.425
Besides, when this company
eliminates cows,

11:17.460 --> 11:19.579
those creamers are gonna
be worth a fortune.

11:20.635 --> 11:23.113
It tastes familiar.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.566
Beef?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.072
- No.
- Chicken?

11:27.107 --> 11:28.921
We'll take chicken.

11:30.118 --> 11:31.464
What does it taste like?

11:32.754 --> 11:34.065
Despair?

11:36.324 --> 11:38.674
Is it possible it just needs salt?

11:43.025 --> 11:45.782
"Despair". That's gonna be a challenge
for the guys writing the jingle.

11:45.817 --> 11:48.197
We just have to redouble our efforts
and fix the problem.

11:48.232 --> 11:49.629
That's what we do here.

11:49.664 --> 11:51.421
If anyone can crack it,
it's Phil and Lem.

11:51.456 --> 11:53.343
Hi, guys. Oh, Ted.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.978
I don't think I can work with
Phil anymore, so...

12:07.285 --> 12:09.640
We may have created
a monster in the lab.

12:09.675 --> 12:13.025
It's not a monster. It's a cyborg
that can kill without remorse.

12:13.105 --> 12:15.755
I was talking about Phil.
What -- what are you talking about?

12:17.254 --> 12:19.304
I was also talking about Phil.

12:21.095 --> 12:22.341
It's classified.

12:22.794 --> 12:24.889
But it's gonna be a fantastic new tool

12:24.924 --> 12:28.247
if we can get it to tell the difference
between soldiers and children.

12:28.283 --> 12:31.187
We have a Phil problem, and that
means we have a meat problem.

12:31.222 --> 12:33.932
I can't have a Phil or a meat problem.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.821
It's bad enough I have a cyborg problem.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.777
Stupid thing just kills whatever's
in front of it.

12:38.812 --> 12:42.311
Yeah... anyway, look, I think all the
attention might have gone to Phil's head.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.334
Now he and Lem aren't
working together

12:44.369 --> 12:46.718
That's it. I'm taking care
of this myself.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.158
Don't... hurt him.

12:49.953 --> 12:50.997
I'm not gonna hurt him.

12:51.032 --> 12:53.840
He has an inflated ego, and
that's something I can work with.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.926
I'm gonna save the company from
a lawsuit, get Phil back to work

12:56.961 --> 12:58.878
and grow me some lab meat.

12:58.913 --> 13:00.013
And then...

13:00.403 --> 13:02.573
I'm gonna be "Trailblazer of the year".

13:05.115 --> 13:07.074
You know that's not a real award?

13:07.109 --> 13:08.509
I want it.

13:16.915 --> 13:19.757
Excuse me, fellas.
I need to borrow our hero.

13:29.901 --> 13:32.101
- Hi, hero.
- Hi, Veronica.

13:32.762 --> 13:35.612
Ooh, I like the way you say my name.
Veronica...

13:36.178 --> 13:38.694
Oh. I like the way I say it, too.

13:38.961 --> 13:41.507
I could listen to you say
your name all day.

13:41.542 --> 13:44.197
So could I. Veronica...

13:44.892 --> 13:48.160
- Wait, I can do it better.
- I don't know. That last one was really good.

13:48.357 --> 13:51.319
Oh, thank you, "Below Zero Hero".

13:53.623 --> 13:55.523
Your hair looks great like that,
by the way.

13:55.558 --> 13:59.042
- You think? My wife hates it.
- She's a pig.

13:59.077 --> 14:00.770
I'm sorry. I guess I just

14:00.805 --> 14:02.663
don't like you talking about her.

14:02.698 --> 14:05.199
That's okay. She doesn't like me
talking about her either...

14:05.234 --> 14:06.895
Or even to her.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.216
Hero, can I ask a favor?

14:10.426 --> 14:12.587
Can I... get your autograph?

14:13.401 --> 14:14.695
Of course...

14:15.134 --> 14:16.238
Veronica.

14:19.431 --> 14:20.440
Great. Right here.

14:23.355 --> 14:25.455
And initial here, here and here.

14:30.295 --> 14:31.795
And date it here.

14:34.146 --> 14:37.389
Oh, look, you just signed a waiver saying
that you won't sue the company.

14:37.424 --> 14:40.907
Of all the pieces of paper I could've
randomly picked for you to autograph...

14:40.942 --> 14:43.031
That is so funny.

14:44.083 --> 14:48.020
Oh, well. Hero time's over.
Find Lem and get back to work.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.397
But, Veronica...

14:49.432 --> 14:51.582
Please stop saying my name.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.427
Have you seen Phil or a blood trail
that could lead to Phil?

14:59.462 --> 15:00.745
He's not here.

15:00.780 --> 15:02.080
And I'm stuck.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.807
Maybe the meat blob's not taking
in enough nutrients.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.516
I guess I could try and give it a mouth.

15:06.551 --> 15:08.745
I'm gonna say no to the meat blob
getting a mouth.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.980
Mostly because I don't want to hear
what it has to say.

15:11.445 --> 15:12.795
Oh, joke's on me.

15:13.617 --> 15:14.873
I'm not a hero.

15:14.908 --> 15:17.734
It was all just a big show
to keep me from suing the company.

15:17.769 --> 15:18.920
Not for me it wasn't.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.959
Phil, I always thought what you did

15:21.994 --> 15:23.535
was incredibly brave,

15:23.570 --> 15:26.520
and I just wanted the company
to acknowledge that.

15:29.339 --> 15:30.419
Thanks.

15:31.119 --> 15:33.394
I guess I was exceptionally fearless.

15:33.429 --> 15:35.392
Speaking of a meat blob with a mouth...

15:35.435 --> 15:38.082
Okay, you know what? You have been
on me since I thawed out,

15:38.117 --> 15:40.247
- and I am sick of it.
- All right.

15:40.282 --> 15:42.675
Guys, this project is far
too important to sacrifice

15:42.710 --> 15:44.449
because you two can't get along,

15:44.484 --> 15:47.858
so let's just dissolve the partnership.

15:49.212 --> 15:51.468
Lem, report down to the third floor.

15:51.503 --> 15:53.925
You team up with Richie
and Fuzzel on this.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.960
Fine.

15:55.878 --> 15:57.457
Richie and Fuzzel?

15:57.955 --> 16:00.447
Their knowledge of
microfabrication technology

16:00.482 --> 16:02.050
for vascularized tissue engineering

16:02.085 --> 16:06.495
vis-a-vis bovine muscle protein --
it's so last year.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.082
Well, at least they don't scream
"Car" every 20 minutes.

16:09.117 --> 16:10.874
It is not "Car," you idiot.

16:10.909 --> 16:13.601
Why would I be yelling for a car?
It is just a sound

16:13.636 --> 16:16.386
that I currently have
trouble not making.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.176
Good-bye, Phil.

16:18.590 --> 16:20.229
Fine. Go, go.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.159
So he just goes?

16:25.194 --> 16:28.527
Ten years of being lab partners, and
he just leaves?

16:28.562 --> 16:33.062
You know, when you agreed to be frozen,
you left him just as suddenly.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.375
- What are you saying?
- Maybe Lem felt as

16:35.410 --> 16:37.817
abandoned as you feel right now.

16:37.852 --> 16:38.852
Wow.

16:40.044 --> 16:41.198
You're right.

16:42.222 --> 16:47.858
How can I know so much about the bonds of chemicals
yet so little about the bonds of friendship?

16:49.772 --> 16:51.001
I have to stop him.

16:55.504 --> 16:56.504
Lem.

16:56.639 --> 16:58.933
- You could've died.
- I'm sorry.

16:58.968 --> 17:00.832
Who would've been my lab partner?

17:00.867 --> 17:03.346
- Richie and Fuzzel?
- Those guys?

17:03.530 --> 17:06.205
They don't know anything about
microfabrication technology

17:06.241 --> 17:09.290
- for vascularized...
- Guys, you're together.

17:09.377 --> 17:11.594
And you have 72 hours to make
that thing taste like

17:11.628 --> 17:14.450
something a drunk teenager
would tip over.

17:16.349 --> 17:17.351
Cow.

17:17.527 --> 17:19.027
I'm talking about a cow.

17:25.228 --> 17:28.178
<i>I had wanted Phil to be
recognized as a hero.</i>

17:28.395 --> 17:30.526
<i>But what is a hero anyway?</i>

17:31.927 --> 17:34.984
<i>Working together again, the
guys discovered their problem.</i>

17:35.019 --> 17:38.654
<i>Real cows move around all day, and so,
build muscle and fat,</i>

17:38.689 --> 17:40.622
<i>and that makes them delicious.</i>

17:40.936 --> 17:45.254
<i>So Phil and Lem decided the meat blob
also needed exercise.</i>

17:45.289 --> 17:47.524
<i>Deep tissue massage didn't help,</i>

17:48.445 --> 17:51.070
<i>so other approaches were tried...</i>

18:03.984 --> 18:05.421
<i>And rejected.</i>

18:12.127 --> 18:13.888
<i>But one thing about heroes:</i>

18:13.923 --> 18:15.473
<i>they never give up.</i>

18:49.955 --> 18:52.184
<i>Sure, there may be obstacles,</i>

18:52.219 --> 18:54.877
<i>people who don't share your vision.</i>

18:54.912 --> 18:58.512
<i>But the important thing is
to stay focused.</i>

19:12.814 --> 19:14.264
<i>What is a hero?</i>

19:14.866 --> 19:18.366
<i>Maybe it's just someone who
comes through when others need them to...</i>

19:22.911 --> 19:25.561
<i>So that everyone can be a hero.</i>

19:28.727 --> 19:31.385
The meat cost $10,000 a pound, so...

19:31.420 --> 19:34.298
it's still a few years from production.

19:34.759 --> 19:36.602
Still Phil, the meat...

19:37.024 --> 19:39.899
For a guy who likes to solve problems,
it's been a pretty good week.

19:39.934 --> 19:42.482
And now I am problemless.

19:42.665 --> 19:44.358
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.

19:44.393 --> 19:47.950
- I'm stealing creamers.
- No, you're not. You're replacing them.

19:47.985 --> 19:50.110
You can't do this.
This ruins everything,

19:50.145 --> 19:52.192
and it wasn't that great of
a plan to begin with.

19:52.227 --> 19:53.771
I was just solving a problem.

19:53.806 --> 19:55.760
I cannot not solve problems.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.995
But now I'd be stealing from you,
and that's not gonna help me.

19:59.896 --> 20:01.096
So now what?

20:02.208 --> 20:06.425
Now that you've ruined this, how am I
gonna relieve my stress, huh, Ted?

20:09.627 --> 20:11.477
Can you think of another way?

20:13.451 --> 20:16.101
I would love to help you
with that, Linda..

20:17.139 --> 20:19.395
But I used up my office affair.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.130
It's not like voting, Ted.

20:21.169 --> 20:23.180
You can punch more than one ballot.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.934
I don't want to be a guy
who votes around.

20:27.795 --> 20:31.202
Well, you've taken the creamer from me,
so now what do I do,

20:31.237 --> 20:32.887
Mr. Problem Solver?

20:35.380 --> 20:37.380
