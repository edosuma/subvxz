And if it's gonna be a problem

12:39.556 --> 12:42.023
tying the Brooks B
tabs to the initiative,

12:42.024 --> 12:43.924
then maybe the party's premature.

12:43.925 --> 12:45.625
Oh, it's more of a hiccup than anything.

12:45.627 --> 12:47.767
Your girl, Anne Wu, would
agree if she was here.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.487
Yeah, well...

12:50.732 --> 12:54.932
Have you, uh, heard from Anne
since she left the company?

12:54.936 --> 12:56.076
What do you mean, left the company?

12:56.077 --> 12:58.018
You guys fired her, didn't you?

12:58.043 --> 12:59.410
Yes.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.915
Yeah, we did.

13:01.268 --> 13:02.443
[sighs]

13:02.444 --> 13:04.913
Why can't they just accept
our gift and say thank you?

13:04.914 --> 13:07.181
Hey, you're preachin' to the choir, man.

13:07.182 --> 13:08.652
No, the school board is just nervous

13:08.653 --> 13:10.750
after the whole iPad debacle down in LA.

13:10.752 --> 13:12.219
But don't worry.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.420
Me and Pernell have plenty
of friends on the board.

13:13.421 --> 13:14.681
We'll... we'll push it through.

13:14.689 --> 13:17.924
Oh, that'll make Nathan
feel a lot better.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.795
Having a crazy murderer on our side.

13:19.796 --> 13:22.532
All right, you know,
shut your fuckin' mouth.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.099
You don't know him.
He's not crazy or guilty.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.900
Well, one's a matter of opinion.

13:27.902 --> 13:29.502
The other one's just a matter of time.

13:36.911 --> 13:38.541
Who gets two MRis in one day?

13:38.546 --> 13:39.916
They did one without contrast,

13:39.917 --> 13:42.549
and now they want one with contrast.

13:42.550 --> 13:43.750
Takes a minute.

13:53.261 --> 13:55.231
Any chance you can make
it six hours instead?

13:55.232 --> 13:56.830
Just to be safe.

13:56.831 --> 13:58.101
I can get you an extra thousand.

13:58.102 --> 13:59.600

13:59.601 --> 14:01.561
Four hours is the best I can do.

14:11.113 --> 14:13.843
Asa.

14:13.848 --> 14:15.149
Look at you.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.110
All grown up.

14:17.119 --> 14:18.289
How you doin', Izzy?

14:18.290 --> 14:20.386
- Great.
- Did he call you?

14:20.388 --> 14:23.328
No, he doesn't need to.
I'm ready to get started.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.359
Well, it's not a done deal.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.490
He's considering other reporters.

14:28.496 --> 14:30.936
Why do you sound like you
don't want it to be me?

14:30.937 --> 14:33.462
Maybe I heard how sneaky you can be.

14:33.468 --> 14:35.869
- Who told you that?
- My mother.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.030
Where is Mr. Mayor?

14:38.039 --> 14:40.141
He's in the conservatory.

14:40.142 --> 14:42.742
With a lead pipe.

14:42.744 --> 14:43.844
Have a good one.

14:45.747 --> 14:48.185
Man, you got some competition, Isadora.

14:48.186 --> 14:49.413
The writer from Time Magazine

14:49.417 --> 14:51.155
called me a dozen times already.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.683
Matter of fact, he's attending
a party I'm having tonight.

14:54.689 --> 14:57.924
Well, then he's too late
and I'm right on time.

14:57.925 --> 15:00.794
[chuckles] I don't know.

15:00.795 --> 15:03.595
He's talking about how I
might be the next Cory Booker.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.999
Even made a comparison to the prez.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.860
- Hmm.
- [laughs]

15:07.869 --> 15:10.304
He must know I got a big ego.

15:10.305 --> 15:12.739
Was he at your mom's funeral?

15:12.740 --> 15:14.400
You know, when you made her that promise

15:14.409 --> 15:18.345
about what type of man you would be?

15:18.346 --> 15:21.315
Knowing each other doesn't
make this a done deal.

15:21.316 --> 15:24.050
I'm still considering my options.

15:24.051 --> 15:26.681
You want me to dance?

15:26.688 --> 15:28.455
I want the cover.

15:28.456 --> 15:29.656
You don't want the cover.

15:29.657 --> 15:32.226
Hell, yeah, I do.

15:32.227 --> 15:34.927
[sighs] Damn cover's all any politician

15:34.929 --> 15:36.330
ever wants to talk about,

15:36.331 --> 15:37.791
but my editor's not gonna give it to

15:37.799 --> 15:40.409

nation's 27th largest city

15:40.410 --> 15:43.332

Then fuck him.

15:45.106 --> 15:46.876

15:48.910 --> 15:51.270
I know how this can work.

15:51.279 --> 15:54.019
I write the whole
piece, not a fluff piece.

It doesn't work. Remember?

16:18.306 --> 16:20.276
- Decades.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

16:20.277 --> 16:22.409
Word is you stayed a handful.

16:22.410 --> 16:24.840
And you stayed put.

16:24.846 --> 16:26.446
You know, I admire that.

16:26.448 --> 16:28.817
I could not wait to get out of here.

16:28.818 --> 16:32.016
Crystal, I spoke to Tammy
not half an hour ago.

16:32.019 --> 16:33.754
My decision stands.

16:33.755 --> 16:36.325
Denise has caused enough trouble here.

16:36.326 --> 16:40.024
Matt, are you aware of the term optics?

16:40.027 --> 16:42.737
I know, I know, people
and PR use it way too much,

16:42.738 --> 16:44.760
but it does matter.

16:44.766 --> 16:48.985
My niece is an openly gay...

young woman

16:50.609 --> 16:53.474
protesting for free speech.

16:53.475 --> 16:56.084
Now, the optics of the situation...

16:56.109 --> 16:58.560
[sighs] well...

16:59.046 --> 17:02.349
since you expelled her, there's
a lot of room for improvement.

17:03.498 --> 17:04.938
Uh, give us a minute.

17:06.288 --> 17:08.993
I spent half an hour on the
phone with the superintendent.

17:08.994 --> 17:11.990
I'm guessing you are the one
that got up his ass about this.

17:11.992 --> 17:15.393
Matt, this could be a
fantastic opportunity for you.

17:15.396 --> 17:17.396
I'm not afraid of him.

17:17.398 --> 17:19.768
And I'm sure as shit not afraid of you.

17:19.769 --> 17:21.704
The Harris' don't reach this far.

You're just another trailer
trash Murphy around here.

17:24.539 --> 17:26.577
- What?
- You have a call waiting.

Start at the beginning.

Who was the officer
that took your phone?

I don't know. Uh...

17:48.888 --> 17:50.496
a Mexican with a mustache.

Okay, what park was it?

17:52.334 --> 17:53.741
Guadalupe.

17:53.766 --> 17:55.205
You remember what day it was?

17:55.206 --> 17:58.472
Yeah, same day that judge, the one
that they're saying killed the cop,

17:58.473 --> 18:01.918
he was splashing in the fountain naked.

18:02.644 --> 18:05.479
You're talking about Pernell Harris?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.410
Yeah, and I filmed him with my phone,

18:08.416 --> 18:10.684
which is not illegal.

18:10.685 --> 18:13.055
But one of your cops took my phone,

18:13.056 --> 18:15.054
which is illegal.

34:09.842 --> 34:13.353
We're here to talk about
the ground rules, Bobo.

34:13.847 --> 34:16.719
Well, we could have did that
over the phone, but you came here.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.510
Yep, I came here professionally.

34:21.529 --> 34:23.989
Okay. So, how does this work?

34:23.989 --> 34:28.974
This 24-7, because if you and me
spend too much time in one room,

34:29.429 --> 34:31.630
we're either fighting or fucking.

34:31.632 --> 34:33.062
I mean...

34:33.065 --> 34:34.565
Fighting or fucking.

34:34.568 --> 34:36.806
I get that no one can work all the time,

34:36.806 --> 34:40.203
and I understand that there's a
professional side and a personal side,

34:40.206 --> 34:44.205
and as long as we keep that line clear,

34:44.545 --> 34:47.728
I'm okay with seeing what happens.

34:48.882 --> 34:51.512
And once it gets too
confidential, you step out.

34:51.518 --> 34:52.858
Well, if you're being the mayor,

34:52.859 --> 34:56.021
I think I'm gonna need to be there.

34:56.022 --> 34:57.790
So it's all or nothing.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.660
That's what I told my editor.

35:00.661 --> 35:02.091
I mean, that's what it needs to be

35:02.095 --> 35:03.565
if you want the cover.

35:07.401 --> 35:09.931
Judge Harris, ready to order?

35:09.936 --> 35:13.673
Yes, uh, I'll have the,
uh, New York, uh, rare,

35:13.674 --> 35:17.774
and, uh, Mrs. Harris
will have the usual.

35:19.279 --> 35:20.646
Excellent choice.

35:20.647 --> 35:24.587
The Chateaubriand has many
restorative properties.

35:34.528 --> 35:38.098
[door opens, closes]

35:44.170 --> 35:45.400
Fries?

35:48.742 --> 35:50.112
They're cold but they're good.

35:54.415 --> 35:55.545
Thanks.

36:01.788 --> 36:03.498
Probably time I found my own place.

36:03.499 --> 36:07.190
You can stay as long as you want.

36:07.193 --> 36:10.129
You always have a home with me.

36:10.130 --> 36:12.430
What is that saying?

36:12.433 --> 36:14.463
Home is where they have to take you in?

36:14.468 --> 36:16.438
Even if you're a stuck up bitch.

36:16.439 --> 36:17.938
I'm not stuck up.

36:17.963 --> 36:19.462
I'm particular.

36:22.443 --> 36:24.113
You didn't fail PJ.

36:25.946 --> 36:28.119
He was brilliant and brave.

36:28.144 --> 36:31.514
No, no, Denise is the brave one.

36:31.518 --> 36:33.666
Where do you think she got it from?

36:34.120 --> 36:38.190
Passionate. Unafraid to take a stand.

36:38.191 --> 36:40.417
Opinionated. That's PJ.

36:40.542 --> 36:41.791
That's PJ.

36:41.795 --> 36:43.935
Ah, you only saw him on the holidays.

36:46.733 --> 36:49.602
Hell, I'm not even sure
I ever really knew him.

36:49.603 --> 36:52.772
- Maybe nobody did.
- Oh, bullshit.

36:52.773 --> 36:54.573
This house has been
full of him for years.

36:54.575 --> 36:56.634
Denise was probably one
of PJ's biggest fans.

36:56.659 --> 37:00.680
She must have watched that
manifesto of his on the internet,

37:00.681 --> 37:02.811
like, 100 times.

37:04.084 --> 37:05.554
What manifesto?

37:12.054 --> 37:15.460
Well, he's a doctor, and I'm sick.

37:16.055 --> 37:18.000
He wouldn't even see me.

37:19.232 --> 37:20.718
And Crystal.

37:21.602 --> 37:23.781
She doesn't want to talk to me.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.184
I mean,

37:25.476 --> 37:27.679
how the hell am I supposed
to tell her how much I...

37:27.680 --> 37:29.304
I... I fuckin' love her

37:29.309 --> 37:30.879
if she won't talk to me?

37:33.580 --> 37:37.249
[laughing]

37:37.250 --> 37:39.519
I still got PJ, though.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.543
He won't even leave me alone.

37:46.259 --> 37:49.194
My life's gone.

37:49.195 --> 37:50.235
Just like that.

37:52.132 --> 37:55.232
How the fuck does that even happen?

37:58.071 --> 38:01.401
Maybe some coffee, Judge Harris?

38:01.407 --> 38:03.609
- [pounds table]
- Yes, Manny.

38:03.610 --> 38:05.641
Coffee is exactly what I need.

38:05.666 --> 38:06.949
Coffee.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.582
Yeah. I'll get some coffee.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.552
[chuckling]

38:12.553 --> 38:13.819
Pernell Harris.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.620
I need you to stand up
and turn around, sir.

38:15.622 --> 38:17.722
Son. Son.

38:20.260 --> 38:22.790
You gotta state the charges,

38:22.796 --> 38:24.696
then you Mirandize the suspect.

38:24.698 --> 38:28.300
You... you don't want me getting
off on a technicality, do you?

38:28.301 --> 38:30.171
Pernell Harris, we have
a warrant for your arrest

38:30.172 --> 38:32.483
for violating the
conditions of your bail.

38:33.406 --> 38:36.576
Clear. And sharp. Nice job.

38:36.577 --> 38:38.110
Nice job.

38:38.111 --> 38:39.741
You have the right to remain silent.

38:39.746 --> 38:41.216
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

38:41.217 --> 38:42.244
in a court of law.

38:42.248 --> 38:44.188
[police radio chatter]

38:54.728 --> 38:55.768
[car door closes]

38:55.769 --> 38:57.892
[police radio chatter]

39:00.634 --> 39:01.904
I need a minute with him.

39:03.737 --> 39:05.607
Get the fuck out of the car, rook.

39:06.807 --> 39:08.947
[police radio chatter]

39:18.318 --> 39:20.187
I heard what they were
doing over the radio.

39:20.188 --> 39:22.524
They should have shown
you a little respect,

39:22.525 --> 39:23.852
let you turn yourself in.

39:23.857 --> 39:25.991
How'd they know I left town?

39:25.992 --> 39:27.222
I don't know.

39:27.227 --> 39:29.267
There's a lot about this I don't like.

39:29.268 --> 39:30.862
Don't you worry.

39:30.864 --> 39:32.634
I won't let them parade
you through the front door.

39:32.635 --> 39:34.800
[radio chatter]

39:34.801 --> 39:36.831
Why are you helping me, Kessler?

39:36.837 --> 39:39.461
It's gotta be more than
what I did for your partner?

39:41.407 --> 39:43.773
- Did you kill Caldwell?
- No.

39:43.777 --> 39:45.414
But you knew he was dirty.

39:45.812 --> 39:47.642
He raped my daughter-in-law.

39:48.815 --> 39:50.653
They're trying to bring you down.

39:50.654 --> 39:53.051
They don't want nobody to
know that Shane was dirty.

39:53.053 --> 39:54.653
And that he's not the only one.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.959
Is that what this is?

39:59.960 --> 40:01.120
They're afraid I may dig out

40:01.127 --> 40:03.327
what's fucked in your department.

40:03.329 --> 40:05.965
But not if I'm in jail.

40:05.966 --> 40:07.736
Well, I can't let you go, Judge.

40:07.737 --> 40:10.402
No, of course not.

40:10.403 --> 40:11.973
Maybe you can help me.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.577
I need to find out how I can
get a hold of this witness,

40:16.578 --> 40:18.443
this Mike Alcala.

40:18.444 --> 40:20.284
He's been telling lies about me.

40:21.715 --> 40:23.715
I'll see what I can find.

40:23.717 --> 40:25.417
[shouting]

40:25.418 --> 40:28.928
And the Lord himself was
sent from heaven with a shout.

40:28.929 --> 40:30.722
[congregation responds]

40:30.724 --> 40:34.093
With a sound from an archangel,

40:34.094 --> 40:37.863
and with the voice of God!

40:37.864 --> 40:39.394
Can you hear him?

40:39.399 --> 40:40.439
Come on, worship him.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.363
[speaking foreign language]

40:47.540 --> 40:48.940
Hallelujah!

40:48.942 --> 40:50.509
Can you hear him?

40:50.510 --> 40:52.640
[speaking Spanish]

41:00.053 --> 41:02.183
[speaking in tongues]

41:16.536 --> 41:17.976
I gotta go.

41:19.639 --> 41:20.809
Me, too.

41:23.476 --> 41:25.576
Hey.

41:25.578 --> 41:27.548
Did you and Mom work your shit out?

41:27.549 --> 41:28.647
Yeah.

41:28.648 --> 41:30.491
We always do.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.680
Eventually.

41:39.292 --> 41:44.192
Your mom told me about PJ's manifesto.

41:45.465 --> 41:47.865
You didn't know about that?

41:47.868 --> 41:50.178
Seems there's a lot I
didn't know about PJ.

41:55.776 --> 41:58.576
Over 350,000 views.

41:58.578 --> 42:02.114
That's not Kardashian
numbers, but it's a lot.

42:02.115 --> 42:04.285
It's all over Facebook and Twitter, too.

42:05.485 --> 42:07.155
People are still watching PJ.

42:10.323 --> 42:13.623
You know what I love the
most about this moment?

42:13.626 --> 42:17.462
The only person who knows
where I am right now...

42:17.463 --> 42:18.663
is me.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.699
[speaking in tongues]

42:20.700 --> 42:23.800
The majesty of God is undeniable.

42:24.735 --> 42:26.535
Listen.

42:26.873 --> 42:30.373
The knowledge of God is infinite.

42:30.376 --> 42:31.976
It's fuckin' majestic.

42:31.978 --> 42:34.713
It's like looking into infinity.

42:34.714 --> 42:38.150
This is what perfection looks like.

42:38.151 --> 42:40.619
Big data hates this place.

42:40.620 --> 42:45.020
Lucifer is not content
with the perfection of God.

42:45.025 --> 42:47.292
He despises man,

42:47.293 --> 42:50.633
because man has the only
thing he will never have.

42:50.634 --> 42:51.660
Never.

42:51.664 --> 42:53.964
Free will.

42:53.967 --> 42:56.035
So they trick us.

42:56.036 --> 42:57.576
They take everything they know about us,

42:57.577 --> 42:59.570
and they use it against us.

42:59.572 --> 43:01.402
To control us.

43:01.407 --> 43:05.110
Woman: He rocks him to
sleep with lullabies.

43:05.111 --> 43:08.211
Science, of technology,

43:08.214 --> 43:11.250
of the knowledge of this world.

43:11.251 --> 43:14.381
He wants to use man's own needs,

43:14.387 --> 43:18.157
and urges to make him weak.

43:18.158 --> 43:20.625
They make it so easy.

43:20.626 --> 43:22.326
Don't they?

43:22.328 --> 43:24.098
We can get a pill for any mood online.

43:24.099 --> 43:26.397
We come at the click of a button.

43:26.399 --> 43:29.634
We Uber our food. I mean, what the fuck?

43:29.635 --> 43:32.071
We've given up the right to choose

43:32.072 --> 43:33.532
in exchange for free shipping,

43:33.539 --> 43:36.375
and a money-back guarantee.

43:36.376 --> 43:41.180
We give them our data, and they
make chains that fit us better.

43:41.181 --> 43:44.611
Chains to imprison men.

43:44.617 --> 43:48.087
I created Bathwater as an answer

43:48.088 --> 43:50.589
to help us break those chains.

43:50.590 --> 43:53.590
Oh, the hands of God

43:53.593 --> 43:57.225
will break the chains
that cannot be broken.

43:58.040 --> 44:01.038
Oh, God is the way.

44:01.745 --> 44:04.445
God is the answer.

44:05.156 --> 44:08.648
The hands of God will blind the devil

44:08.673 --> 44:11.014
with holy water.

44:11.577 --> 44:13.708
The hands of God

44:14.466 --> 44:18.035
will free men from the
knowledge of this world.

44:18.084 --> 44:20.923
If they can't track us,
they can't control us.

44:20.924 --> 44:22.421
If they can't control us,

44:22.422 --> 44:24.935
we might be able to
resurrect our future.

44:26.635 --> 44:29.865
I might not be around to see it,

44:30.263 --> 44:32.131
but Bathwater will.

44:32.132 --> 44:34.399
Wash us in the water.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.930
And maybe in some small way

44:36.937 --> 44:39.154
it'll make their control less,

44:39.253 --> 44:41.321
our freedom more,

44:41.674 --> 44:44.709
and help us to wake the fuck up!

44:44.710 --> 44:47.740
Wash us in the water.

44:47.747 --> 44:48.847
And awake us.

44:48.848 --> 44:50.215
Wake the fuck up!

44:50.216 --> 44:53.685
[sobbing] Wash us in the water,

44:53.686 --> 44:55.220
and awake us.

44:55.221 --> 44:57.091
Wake the fuck up!
