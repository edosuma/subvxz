05:20.888 --> 05:23.516
- So how was it?
- Good.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.894
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.

05:27.145 --> 05:29.564
Anything I can do to change your mind?

05:29.772 --> 05:31.649
Nope. No way.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.278
You know, there's an old saying:

05:36.821 --> 05:40.241
"No matter how hot it gets up there
during the day...

05:40.491 --> 05:43.703
...there's not a..."
- "Not a damn thing to do at night."

05:43.911 --> 05:47.790
What the hell are you gonna do
at night in the middle of nowhere?

05:48.499 --> 05:50.084
Sleep like a winner.

05:52.336 --> 05:57.092
Doug, you're a city boy with
a low threshold of boredom.

05:57.509 --> 05:59.261
You'll be back in two weeks.

06:04.057 --> 06:05.893
Come in the office for a minute.

06:06.143 --> 06:08.770
I got people waiting upstairs.

06:11.982 --> 06:13.734
I wanted to tell you...

06:13.984 --> 06:17.321
...Senator Parker's coming
to the dedication tonight.

06:17.529 --> 06:20.782
He's almost guaranteed
the urban renewal contract.

06:21.450 --> 06:22.951
Do you know what that means?

06:23.160 --> 06:26.079
Skyscrapers like this
all over the country.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.790
You design them. I'll build them.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.960
Jim, I think you suffer from
an edifice complex.

06:32.211 --> 06:33.837
You'll never leave.

06:34.087 --> 06:38.175
After the party, come on downstairs
and watch me burn my black tie.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.856
Glad to see you back.

06:53.273 --> 06:55.317
Doug, I can't understand it.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.402
The dampers won't stay opened.

06:57.653 --> 07:00.739
- Whatever happened to "hello"?
- Hello.

07:00.989 --> 07:02.449
- How are you?
- Good.

07:02.658 --> 07:04.034
You look like it took.

07:04.243 --> 07:06.578
- Hi, Mr. Roberts.
- Just a second.

07:06.829 --> 07:07.872
We'll miss you.

07:08.039 --> 07:10.542
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.

07:10.792 --> 07:13.336
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?

07:13.586 --> 07:17.173
- Thompson G-4s.
- Don't you think they should be G-12s?

07:17.966 --> 07:21.553
That's what comes from
last-minute panic. I'll fix it.

07:21.761 --> 07:23.972
There's ground water
on that Atlanta job.

07:24.222 --> 07:25.849
Bring the designs in today.

07:26.099 --> 07:27.851
How about Chicago specs?

07:28.101 --> 07:30.270
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.273
Well, hello.

07:33.523 --> 07:34.732
Welcome back.

07:35.984 --> 07:38.236
Are you taking any calls?

07:38.611 --> 07:39.737
Who's there?

07:42.782 --> 07:44.909
No, I'm not taking any calls.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.110
Are we gonna talk at all?

08:18.360 --> 08:20.779
No. It's my lunch hour.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.701
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger,
you know.

08:26.285 --> 08:29.330
You're better.
All protein, no bread.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.707
All I need to go with you
is about eight glasses of water.

08:32.957 --> 08:35.836
All I need to go with you
is in that suitcase.

08:36.086 --> 08:39.965
I got about a $ 140 worth of
vulgar underwear for you.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.092
First things first.

08:52.019 --> 08:53.521
That's nice.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.610
Years from now, when they talk
about this, and they will...

08:59.860 --> 09:03.280
...remember to tell them that
it was my idea.

09:15.876 --> 09:17.127
Got change for a 50?

09:18.212 --> 09:20.005
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.

09:20.881 --> 09:22.091
Not a chance!

09:22.299 --> 09:24.218
Let's see what we got here...

09:28.013 --> 09:33.061
Twenty-five, 50, 60...

09:34.396 --> 09:37.983
...70, 75...

09:39.067 --> 09:41.611
...85, 95.

09:41.862 --> 09:45.157
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.539
All your security squad's up there...

10:45.551 --> 10:46.969
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.

10:47.220 --> 10:48.429
Hi, Phillip.

10:48.679 --> 10:52.099
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.

10:55.353 --> 10:58.272
Mommy wants to know if
you'll have dinner with us?

10:58.523 --> 11:01.609
Thank you, but I'm going up
to the tower party.

11:01.818 --> 11:03.110
Aren't you coming?

11:09.659 --> 11:13.287
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't
go to parties since Daddy died.

11:15.581 --> 11:17.834
Here, let me take that paint off.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.587
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?

11:21.796 --> 11:25.174
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?

11:25.424 --> 11:26.634
Okay.

11:27.301 --> 11:28.678
Goodbye.

11:29.136 --> 11:31.597
Okay, I'll get on it right now.

11:35.226 --> 11:38.938
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.148
Mr. Callahan?

11:40.356 --> 11:42.233
We still got any G-12 electrodes?

11:42.483 --> 11:44.527
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.

11:44.735 --> 11:47.864
Okay, booster pump, zone one.

11:48.156 --> 11:49.949
- One-ten.
- Check.

11:50.199 --> 11:52.452
Main generator, zone one.

11:52.828 --> 11:54.538
I don't get any reading.

11:54.788 --> 11:57.457
Try the auxiliary generator.

12:00.878 --> 12:02.504
What the hell?

12:04.214 --> 12:05.591
Go ahead.

12:18.145 --> 12:19.188
Here we are.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.982
Are there offices on this floor,
as well as apartments?

12:22.232 --> 12:23.984
I wouldn't like that at all!

12:24.234 --> 12:26.445
The business offices only go up to 80.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.322
From the 81 st floor, here...

12:28.530 --> 12:31.658
...all the way up to 120,
it's exclusively residential.

12:31.909 --> 12:35.829
Now, the apartment
I want to show you is 8145...

13:04.234 --> 13:06.861
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.845
Something's screwed up.

13:32.095 --> 13:34.430
The sensor didn't trip
the fire alarm.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.809
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.

13:38.268 --> 13:39.561
There's no fire.

13:39.811 --> 13:43.231
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.

13:43.481 --> 13:46.568
He said they're having
wiring problems down there.

13:46.818 --> 13:48.611
You better stay with it.

13:51.614 --> 13:55.702
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.

13:57.328 --> 13:58.830
What's the matter?

14:04.919 --> 14:05.962
Hello?

14:08.298 --> 14:11.801
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.

14:13.596 --> 14:15.097
That's nice.

14:18.267 --> 14:21.729
I mean... I guess we've got ourselves
a situation.

14:23.981 --> 14:25.316
It seems.

14:26.775 --> 14:30.446
I want the kind of life
you're talking about. I want that.

14:30.654 --> 14:34.909
I want a place where our kids can
run around and grow and be free.

14:35.117 --> 14:36.160
But?

14:39.413 --> 14:41.373
I want this job.

14:41.582 --> 14:43.083
I wanted it for five years.

14:43.292 --> 14:46.795
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.

14:48.756 --> 14:51.884
See, I have ideas, Doug.

14:52.301 --> 14:57.264
I can do something with it
that hasn't been done before.

14:59.975 --> 15:03.729
I guess I want both, and I
can't have both. Can I?

15:05.856 --> 15:07.608
I don't know.

15:15.866 --> 15:16.909
Where?

15:18.494 --> 15:19.954
Be right there.

15:21.372 --> 15:23.708
Let's hold this off till tonight.

15:29.339 --> 15:30.382
What happened?

15:30.632 --> 15:33.718
We kicked on the auxiliary,
and this shorted out.

15:34.845 --> 15:36.221
Power off?

15:44.229 --> 15:47.274
- What about that?
- It should've been conduit.

15:47.774 --> 15:49.776
Give me a pair of dikes.

16:11.131 --> 16:14.509
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.

16:14.759 --> 16:16.303
Now just how bad is it?

16:16.553 --> 16:18.972
Depends on how good
your imagination is.

16:19.222 --> 16:20.640
Jesus Christ!

16:20.891 --> 16:23.768
Specs called for
conduit safety covering.

16:26.521 --> 16:29.107
How many fuse terminals
did you check?

16:29.357 --> 16:30.650
How many do I have to?

16:33.528 --> 16:35.448
<i>Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.</i>

16:35.656 --> 16:37.325
Okay, send him in.

16:37.575 --> 16:40.703
Now, Doug, one piece of
scorched wire...

16:40.953 --> 16:44.040
...from a burned-out circuit breaker
isn't conclusive.

16:44.290 --> 16:49.003
Maybe not. But now I'm worried about
what other shocks we're in for.

16:50.004 --> 16:52.548
Will, Doug...

16:52.840 --> 16:56.511
...J.D., wait till you see this.

17:02.225 --> 17:04.894
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?

17:05.102 --> 17:08.189
We have an equipment problem.

17:09.732 --> 17:12.777
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.

17:12.984 --> 17:14.569
Come on.
You're just guessing.

17:14.820 --> 17:17.073
I want to talk
to your son-in-law.

17:17.323 --> 17:19.659
I wanna talk to him right away.

17:21.828 --> 17:23.663
<i>- Get Roger Simmons.
- Yes, sir.</i>

17:23.913 --> 17:25.748
I guarantee I'll check this out.

17:25.998 --> 17:27.750
We're all going
to check it out.

17:30.378 --> 17:31.754
I'm missing something.

17:33.256 --> 17:34.799
We damn near had a fire.

17:38.261 --> 17:39.595
Yeah, a fire.

17:42.598 --> 17:45.561
In this building? Come on.

17:45.811 --> 17:48.564
We haven't finished installing
the safety equipment.

17:48.814 --> 17:51.984
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!

17:52.192 --> 17:54.486
Everybody's overreacting.

17:55.112 --> 17:57.781
<i>- Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?</i>

17:57.990 --> 18:01.577
<i>They don 't know, sir,
but I left word for him to call.</i>

18:04.872 --> 18:09.084
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.

18:09.334 --> 18:12.212
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope. Won't wait.

18:26.268 --> 18:27.769
Try zone one again.

18:29.563 --> 18:31.398
Damn it!
This is top priority.

18:31.607 --> 18:33.942
We gotta get these
electrical systems on.

18:34.193 --> 18:37.237
Our security program's
loused up without them.

18:59.010 --> 19:00.470
Don't go away.

19:18.696 --> 19:20.949
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!

19:23.701 --> 19:26.704
Where's that electrical
genius of yours?

19:26.955 --> 19:30.333
I called his office, the club,
the marina. No luck.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.293
What's he done?

19:35.088 --> 19:37.090
Come on, I'll get you a drink.

19:39.425 --> 19:42.095
He must've done something.
My father called.

19:42.345 --> 19:44.389
He hasn't been that upset in years.

19:44.639 --> 19:46.683
Have any idea where he is?

19:48.810 --> 19:51.688
Well my husband's territory
ranges rather widely.

19:51.896 --> 19:56.776
It's like that of the timber wolf,
anywhere within a 50-mile radius.

19:57.318 --> 19:59.404
But if you wanna wait,
he'll show up.

19:59.654 --> 20:01.698
He has to.
His clothes are here.

20:03.741 --> 20:06.452
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

20:08.372 --> 20:11.500
I guess you don't plan to tell me
what Roger's done.

20:18.632 --> 20:20.050
Hi, Doug.

20:20.634 --> 20:22.428
- Honey.
- Hello.

20:23.137 --> 20:26.515
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.

20:27.141 --> 20:29.894
Well, welcome back from
the wilderness.

20:30.144 --> 20:32.563
To what do we owe the pleasure?

20:33.022 --> 20:35.065
Callahan was
testing a backup generator.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.401
There was a systems failure.

20:38.694 --> 20:40.279
How can that be?

20:40.529 --> 20:42.031
It can't be, theoretically.

20:43.616 --> 20:47.411
Unless you screwed around
with the electrical specifications.

20:48.787 --> 20:50.998
That's being rather blunt,
isn't it?

20:51.415 --> 20:52.750
You betcha.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.920
Then you'll understand my being
equally blunt.

20:56.170 --> 20:58.172
What the hell business is it of yours?

20:58.881 --> 21:01.342
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.

21:02.885 --> 21:05.221
I don't have to take crap from you.

21:07.973 --> 21:11.560
Listen. We had an electrical
flare-up in the main utility room.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.772
Some of that wiring
wasn't exactly what I asked for.

21:15.147 --> 21:19.069
All the wire I put in is up to code,
inspected and approved.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.739
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!

21:22.989 --> 21:25.742
I asked for installations
way above standard.

21:25.992 --> 21:29.871
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.669
I want your wiring diagrams
and copies of your work orders.

21:35.919 --> 21:39.381
That would take weeks
and a lot more clout than you have!

21:39.589 --> 21:42.634
In my office! Tomorrow, 9:00.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.682
They say he used to wrestle
grizzly bears in Montana.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.686
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.

21:56.022 --> 21:58.859
You must have enjoyed
all this immensely.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.194
No, I didn't.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.364
Actually, I'm depressed
for both of us.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.659
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.998
If you've done anything to
Dad's building, God help you.

22:13.707 --> 22:17.669
Baby, I don't need God's help
or your old man's. Not anymore.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.214
So don't expect me to shake
every time Daddy barks...

22:22.007 --> 22:25.177
...even if that's
what you want me to do.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.140
All I want is the man
I thought I married.

22:33.186 --> 22:37.106
I guess we're running out of
reasons to stay married, aren't we?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.444
It's getting late.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.363
Mustn't miss the party.

24:24.214 --> 24:28.260
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!

24:28.510 --> 24:31.972
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!

24:43.192 --> 24:44.234
Hi.

24:46.862 --> 24:50.073
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.

24:50.282 --> 24:51.618
At my age?

24:51.868 --> 24:54.329
I only care that they show up at all.

24:55.038 --> 24:56.164
Nonsense.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.210
Be a good girl, Elke.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.922
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.

25:08.092 --> 25:09.928
Did you find Simmons?

25:10.303 --> 25:11.638
Yeah, I found him.

25:11.888 --> 25:14.140
Did he or didn't he change your specs?

25:14.390 --> 25:16.851
He didn't admit it,
but I bet you he did.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.605
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.

25:24.192 --> 25:25.568
Here you are...

25:25.777 --> 25:27.904
...your original specs.

25:28.154 --> 25:30.990
Zone one only, but
we gotta start somewhere.

25:33.910 --> 25:36.663
That son of a bitch
gave us an impossible job.

25:44.003 --> 25:45.296
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.

25:45.588 --> 25:46.631
Good evening.

25:46.881 --> 25:50.176
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations. It's magnificent.

25:50.385 --> 25:51.845
Thank you.

25:52.345 --> 25:53.972
I'll meet you out front.

25:54.222 --> 25:57.058
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.

26:00.478 --> 26:03.148
Find me the architect
who designed you...

26:03.399 --> 26:05.526
...and who needs Doug Roberts?

26:05.776 --> 26:07.069
I do.

26:08.195 --> 26:10.823
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a gala evening.

26:11.031 --> 26:13.534
The entire city
is in a holiday mood.

26:13.784 --> 26:16.704
The list of luminaries reads
like a Who's Who.

26:16.954 --> 26:19.790
There are leaders
from society and government...

26:19.999 --> 26:22.543
...stars of screen and television.

26:22.835 --> 26:26.463
And now, just arriving,
the Honorable Gary Parker...

26:26.672 --> 26:30.009
...chairman of the
Federal Urban Renewal Commission.

26:30.259 --> 26:33.804
The senator's in from Washington
to be here for the dedication.

26:34.013 --> 26:36.473
Senator Parker,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:36.724 --> 26:40.853
We'll try to get him to the microphone
to say a few words for you.

26:46.066 --> 26:48.068
Thank you. Thank you.

26:48.319 --> 26:49.820
Thank you very much.

26:50.613 --> 26:53.157
I'm honored to be here tonight.

26:53.449 --> 26:57.578
This magnificent building
represents yet another landmark...

26:57.828 --> 27:00.748
...in a long succession of landmarks
for this great city.

27:01.499 --> 27:03.584
I think you've
got him in the bag, Jim.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.545
- Being here at
this historic moment.

27:06.795 --> 27:08.172
Thank you.

27:13.887 --> 27:17.766
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.

27:18.016 --> 27:21.728
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter
of the builder, Jim Duncan.

27:28.276 --> 27:29.653
How are you?

27:30.487 --> 27:32.280
Nice to see you, senator.

27:32.531 --> 27:35.075
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.

27:35.992 --> 27:37.494
Where were you all day?

27:37.744 --> 27:41.122
I wasn't aware
the leash was that tight.

27:41.498 --> 27:44.084
Later, I wanna
ask you a few questions...

27:44.334 --> 27:47.170
...and I expect
some straight answers.

27:48.171 --> 27:53.218
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.

28:18.702 --> 28:20.537
I thank you very much.

28:24.584 --> 28:29.005
I hereby dedicate
this magnificent glass tower...

28:29.255 --> 28:32.216
...tallest building in the world!

28:39.098 --> 28:41.893
We'll make it. That's it.

28:47.106 --> 28:48.900
All right, Callahan?

28:50.026 --> 28:51.194
Hit them.

29:21.724 --> 29:22.892
This way.

29:23.726 --> 29:26.312
It's really something, isn't it?

29:29.649 --> 29:31.025
After you.

29:38.116 --> 29:39.159
Come on, Dan.

29:39.368 --> 29:42.496
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

29:58.303 --> 30:01.265
I've never seen
the bridge look like that.

30:02.349 --> 30:04.142
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!

30:19.616 --> 30:23.412
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you. Good night.

30:23.662 --> 30:25.789
Shall I leave you a night line?

30:26.039 --> 30:29.626
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.

30:32.546 --> 30:33.589
Lorrie...

30:33.839 --> 30:36.508
Sorry, but I have
a letter that must go out.

30:36.758 --> 30:38.385
See you Monday, Janet.

30:42.097 --> 30:45.518
Gee, I never thought he'd
come back here before the party.

30:45.768 --> 30:47.604
We almost missed him.

30:47.854 --> 30:50.899
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.

30:51.941 --> 30:53.193
Have a nice weekend.

30:53.401 --> 30:54.444
Thanks. You too.

31:21.221 --> 31:22.430
Hello.

31:23.723 --> 31:24.891
Hi.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.770
- Promise me something?
- What?

31:29.020 --> 31:33.358
If I ever start taking you for granted,
do something about it.

31:33.608 --> 31:35.735
And what do you suggest?

31:36.861 --> 31:38.863
Cut off the phone lines.

31:39.572 --> 31:41.574
Pour coffee down my neck.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.077
Tweak my nose?

31:46.371 --> 31:47.622
I promise.

32:57.860 --> 32:59.820
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.

33:00.070 --> 33:01.655
Good. Gary?

33:02.656 --> 33:05.201
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.

33:05.451 --> 33:09.623
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.

33:10.415 --> 33:12.501
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.

33:12.876 --> 33:15.629
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.

33:15.837 --> 33:18.131
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.

33:18.381 --> 33:21.176
Show him what you've been
hiding back there.

33:21.426 --> 33:22.719
Yes, sir.

33:27.766 --> 33:29.392
1929?

33:29.976 --> 33:32.771
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?

33:33.021 --> 33:35.690
What you don't drink,
we'll ship to Washington.

33:35.941 --> 33:38.527
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.

33:41.154 --> 33:44.199
How did you ever come by a whole case?

33:44.491 --> 33:46.076
Come on, Jim.

33:46.993 --> 33:48.370
It's nothing.

33:55.168 --> 33:57.128
I guess you're looking for someone.

33:57.379 --> 33:58.839
I am. Have you seen him?

33:59.089 --> 34:01.550
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?

34:01.800 --> 34:06.304
- Nothing right now. Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...

34:06.721 --> 34:09.891
What does a girl do in San Francisco
when her old man...

34:10.141 --> 34:12.143
...decides to leave for two years?

34:14.896 --> 34:16.231
Beats me, buddy.

34:16.481 --> 34:18.442
No headhunting?

34:18.693 --> 34:21.112
I've had a little trouble
making that work.

34:21.362 --> 34:23.989
Could we discuss that
tomorrow at lunch?

34:24.239 --> 34:25.574
No.

34:34.958 --> 34:38.129
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.

34:38.379 --> 34:41.132
It gets rather dull
in the south of France.

34:41.382 --> 34:46.387
Nothing but swimming and yachting,
partying and all that sort of thing.

34:46.637 --> 34:51.266
And believe it or not, they fight
over the few eligible bachelors.

34:51.516 --> 34:53.853
Even such old scraps as I.

34:54.061 --> 34:57.398
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?

34:58.900 --> 35:03.905
I decided to come back to
the reality of San Francisco...

35:04.155 --> 35:07.325
...to regain my perspective
and my humility...

35:07.575 --> 35:11.078
...and spend more time at the one
thing I'm really good at:

35:11.329 --> 35:13.039
The stock market.

35:13.539 --> 35:17.627
Monte Carlo's losses,
San Francisco's gains.

35:17.835 --> 35:18.878
Thank you.

35:19.962 --> 35:22.965
Do you believe in destiny?

35:25.218 --> 35:27.637
I believe in all good things.

35:30.641 --> 35:34.520
There must be a reason
for my coming back home.

35:34.978 --> 35:36.188
Meeting you.

35:56.917 --> 35:58.710
This can't be right.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.176
It's too hot.

36:06.718 --> 36:08.720
You better leave it off.

36:18.897 --> 36:20.232
Utility. Wes.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.276
Doug,
I'm up on 83 with Will.

36:22.526 --> 36:25.612
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.

36:25.863 --> 36:28.782
Shut down as many of
the zone one systems as you can.

36:28.991 --> 36:30.200
I can't do that.

36:30.450 --> 36:32.995
All the lights are on
for the dedication ceremony.

36:33.203 --> 36:36.582
You mean the whole building?

36:37.332 --> 36:39.377
We're taking
the overload just fine.

36:40.503 --> 36:42.463
Well, shut it down right away.

36:42.672 --> 36:46.009
I can't do that without an okay
from Mr. Duncan himself.

36:46.217 --> 36:49.470
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!

36:49.679 --> 36:52.223
What about the lights
in the tower for the party?

36:52.432 --> 36:56.060
- Not all the power, just the overload!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!

36:57.520 --> 37:00.690
We better get down to 81
and check the relay systems.

37:00.940 --> 37:03.568
They turned on everything
in the whole building.

37:04.068 --> 37:06.279
There's something on 81.

37:20.001 --> 37:24.255
Phone it in, in case the lines
to the fire department are out.

37:24.506 --> 37:26.299
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.

38:48.507 --> 38:49.717
Get those drapes!

38:55.431 --> 38:57.141
Smother it!
Try to smother it!

38:57.391 --> 39:01.021
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him. Come on!

39:01.229 --> 39:03.481
Let's get some water onto that fire.

39:05.442 --> 39:07.027
Turn it on!

39:31.927 --> 39:34.554
Down, down! Stay low!

39:39.184 --> 39:41.436
Call an ambulance for this man.

39:42.354 --> 39:44.898
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!

39:46.107 --> 39:47.817
I want everybody off this floor!

39:48.068 --> 39:50.195
- The fire department?
- On their way.

39:50.403 --> 39:53.824
Get that ambulance. Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.

39:54.074 --> 39:57.911
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.

39:58.119 --> 40:02.290
This is 81. A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.

40:02.541 --> 40:03.667
Yes, right away.

40:03.917 --> 40:07.504
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.

40:07.754 --> 40:09.631
- What?
- Do it now!

40:26.274 --> 40:27.942
It's Mr. Roberts.

40:28.317 --> 40:30.903
Yeah, Doug. We were
getting worried about you.

40:31.153 --> 40:34.407
Susan's here, Senator Parker,
the mayor and his wife.

40:34.657 --> 40:37.702
They're asking why
the greatest architect isn't here.

40:37.910 --> 40:41.122
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.083
Will Giddings burned? How?

40:44.500 --> 40:47.336
An ambulance is coming,
but you better think about...

40:47.545 --> 40:50.506
...getting those people down
on the ground floor.

40:50.756 --> 40:53.593
What for?
We got a fire here!

40:54.385 --> 40:56.888
Well, I think
it's under control, but...

40:57.221 --> 40:59.557
Well, then why the urgency?

41:00.474 --> 41:01.934
Urgency?

41:02.185 --> 41:04.979
If fluky wiring in this building
caused that fire...

41:05.229 --> 41:07.273
...fires could break out everywhere!

41:07.481 --> 41:11.152
Doug, I think you're overreacting.

41:11.402 --> 41:15.281
I feel sorry for Will Giddings,
but he'll be taken care of.

41:15.573 --> 41:19.660
But I won't concern myself with
a fire in a storage room on 81...

41:19.869 --> 41:22.622
...because it can't possibly
affect us up here...

41:22.873 --> 41:24.875
...not in this building.

41:25.459 --> 41:29.671
Now, have someone call me
when the fire department arrives.

41:29.922 --> 41:34.885
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket
and come up and join the party!

42:07.209 --> 42:11.380
What building's on the corner
of Montgomery and...

42:12.965 --> 42:14.925
Oh, Jesus!

42:16.176 --> 42:18.095
- The glass tower!
- What?

42:18.345 --> 42:20.138
The glass tower!

42:22.099 --> 42:25.561
I sure hope that fire's on
the first floor.

42:27.437 --> 42:29.940
Did you ever fight one
in a high rise?

42:34.696 --> 42:37.031
Is it as rough as I hear?

42:38.783 --> 42:41.619
Like being inside a chimney.

43:02.599 --> 43:03.766
Jesus!

43:03.975 --> 43:07.478
How in the hell did they get here
before we did?

43:08.897 --> 43:11.065
Don't anybody
ever stay home anymore?

43:34.881 --> 43:38.593
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?

43:38.843 --> 43:41.262
We've got lobby control,
second alarm is in.

43:41.513 --> 43:43.973
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.603
Chief...

43:48.312 --> 43:50.231
...this is Roberts, the architect.

43:50.481 --> 43:54.818
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.

43:55.069 --> 43:58.614
It's bad. Smoke's so thick,
we can't tell how far it's spread.

43:58.864 --> 44:01.575
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.

44:01.826 --> 44:03.369
It must be a motor burnout.

44:03.619 --> 44:06.747
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.

44:06.997 --> 44:09.625
- Why not?
- I don't know.

44:11.252 --> 44:12.336
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?

44:12.586 --> 44:15.673
Give us a quick refresher on
your standpipe system.

44:15.881 --> 44:19.635
- Floors have 3 and 1.5- inch outlets.
- GPM?

44:19.844 --> 44:23.389
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68,
1000 from 68 to 100...

44:23.597 --> 44:25.724
...and 500 from there to the roof.

44:25.975 --> 44:29.270
Are these elevators
programmed for emergencies?

44:29.520 --> 44:32.398
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79. My office.

44:32.648 --> 44:36.443
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.

44:36.694 --> 44:38.237
Men, take up the equipment.

44:38.487 --> 44:39.655
Let's go.

44:46.996 --> 44:48.414
Architects!

44:48.622 --> 44:50.124
Yeah, it's all our fault.

44:51.959 --> 44:55.922
You know we can't fight a fire
in anything over the 7th floor.

44:56.131 --> 44:58.675
But you keep building them
as high as you can.

45:00.677 --> 45:03.513
Are you here to take me on,
or the fire?

45:05.140 --> 45:09.060
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?

45:10.812 --> 45:13.273
I wanna see all floor plans,
81 through 85.

45:13.523 --> 45:14.566
Gotcha.

45:15.192 --> 45:18.069
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.

45:18.320 --> 45:22.199
Chief, 81 has been evacuated,
but it doesn't look too good up there.

45:22.407 --> 45:24.409
Give me a list of your tenants.

45:24.659 --> 45:26.786
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.

45:27.037 --> 45:28.455
Not live-ins. Businesses.

45:28.663 --> 45:31.458
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.

45:31.708 --> 45:33.460
Those that have are off at night.

45:33.668 --> 45:35.962
I wanna know who they are, not where.

45:36.213 --> 45:39.090
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?

45:39.966 --> 45:41.927
Any wool or silk manufacturers?

45:42.177 --> 45:44.763
In a fire, wool and silk
give off cyanide gas.

45:45.013 --> 45:48.475
Any sporting-good manufacturers,
like table-tennis balls?

45:48.725 --> 45:52.437
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?

45:52.646 --> 45:54.981
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.

45:58.068 --> 45:59.194
What do we got?

45:59.444 --> 46:01.029
Elevator bank, central core.

46:01.279 --> 46:04.533
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.

46:04.741 --> 46:08.120
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.

46:08.371 --> 46:09.580
- This is south?
- South.

46:09.831 --> 46:12.041
Have you got any construction on 81?

46:12.291 --> 46:15.628
Anything that can blow up, like
gasoline, fabric cleaner?

46:15.878 --> 46:17.463
I don't think so.

46:17.672 --> 46:18.965
Good. I'll be up on 81.

46:19.173 --> 46:23.261
For what it's worth, this is one
building I figured wouldn't burn.

46:24.512 --> 46:25.888
Neither did I.

46:27.849 --> 46:29.892
And they're celebrating.
A party.

46:30.768 --> 46:32.103
What party? Where?

46:32.311 --> 46:34.814
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.

46:35.022 --> 46:36.566
Why didn't you get them out?

46:36.774 --> 46:40.611
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.

46:41.404 --> 46:42.488
I will.

46:46.325 --> 46:47.702
Here he is now.

46:48.744 --> 46:50.204
This is Duncan.

46:52.290 --> 46:53.958
A battalion chief?

46:54.959 --> 46:57.295
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.

47:01.757 --> 47:04.927
Ted, take your men down
to check that hallway.

47:05.219 --> 47:06.262
Jack?

47:06.929 --> 47:08.639
Jack, how bad?

47:09.056 --> 47:12.518
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.

47:19.359 --> 47:22.112
Work it around.
Up there.

47:25.282 --> 47:27.201
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.

47:31.163 --> 47:32.206
Jack...

47:32.539 --> 47:33.999
...watch yourself.

47:35.292 --> 47:37.127
Keep it high.

48:13.872 --> 48:16.166
- Looking for me, chief?
- If you're Duncan.

48:16.416 --> 48:17.459
I am.

48:17.668 --> 48:19.253
Everything under control?

48:19.753 --> 48:21.672
Gotta move these people out of here.

48:21.922 --> 48:23.841
Now, just how bad is it?

48:24.049 --> 48:26.385
It's a fire, mister, and
all fires are bad.

48:27.970 --> 48:31.349
You're not familiar with
the many modern safety systems...

48:31.558 --> 48:33.852
...we have designed into this building.

48:34.060 --> 48:35.311
We've got them all.

48:35.895 --> 48:38.690
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.

48:38.940 --> 48:40.859
I don't think you're listening.

48:41.067 --> 48:45.071
A fire on 81 can't reach up here,
not in this building.

48:46.364 --> 48:48.741
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.

48:49.701 --> 48:51.995
Do you want me to pull rank
with the mayor?

48:52.203 --> 48:54.289
With a fire,
I outrank everybody here.

48:54.789 --> 48:56.708
One thing we don't want is a panic.

48:56.916 --> 48:58.960
I could tell them, but you ought to.

48:59.169 --> 49:02.422
Just make a nice, cool announcement
to all your guests...

49:02.630 --> 49:06.551
...that the party's being moved down
below the fire floor. Now.

49:46.425 --> 49:49.887
Patty, you and Susan stay right here
where I can find you.

49:50.137 --> 49:52.056
Now, don't leave this table.

49:52.306 --> 49:54.141
You, I wanna talk to.

49:58.604 --> 50:01.649
Did you change any of Doug's
electrical specifications?

50:01.899 --> 50:04.610
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?

50:04.860 --> 50:07.488
The reason should be obvious,
especially to you.

50:07.738 --> 50:08.781
We've got a fire.

50:09.031 --> 50:12.284
If it was caused by what you did,
I'll hang you out to dry.

50:12.493 --> 50:14.662
And then I'm going to hang you!

50:18.332 --> 50:20.334
Would you please stop playing?

50:20.584 --> 50:22.294
Stop playing, will you?

50:24.880 --> 50:26.674
Ladies and gentlemen...

50:28.425 --> 50:32.096
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

50:33.430 --> 50:36.433
It seems that we have a small fire...

50:37.184 --> 50:39.228
...in one of our storage rooms...

50:39.478 --> 50:41.021
...50 floors below.

50:41.981 --> 50:44.233
I assure you there's no danger.

50:44.984 --> 50:48.571
But in accordance with
the fire department's orders...

50:49.823 --> 50:52.200
...a purely precautionary procedure...

50:53.243 --> 50:56.913
...we're going to move the party
down to the lobby for a while.

50:57.164 --> 51:01.084
And we'll be serving cocktails and
champagne in our Continental Room.

51:01.334 --> 51:05.130
But I promise you,
dinner will not be delayed.

51:05.547 --> 51:08.383
Now if we can all move
to the elevators...

51:26.610 --> 51:28.320
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

51:28.570 --> 51:30.989
...there's no reason to rush.

51:32.407 --> 51:34.868
Senator Parker, you and your party.

51:36.620 --> 51:38.413
It's really all right.

51:38.663 --> 51:41.208
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

51:46.004 --> 51:47.881
- Lisolette!
- Frank!

51:49.758 --> 51:51.134
Lisolette!

52:10.071 --> 52:12.615
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.

52:13.199 --> 52:15.952
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.

52:16.160 --> 52:17.203
Fire lapping?

52:17.411 --> 52:20.373
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.

52:20.623 --> 52:23.042
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.

52:23.292 --> 52:25.962
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.

52:26.212 --> 52:29.298
Splice these lines into
our two-way communications van.

52:29.465 --> 52:30.508
Sure.

52:30.716 --> 52:31.926
- No problem?
- No problem.

52:32.176 --> 52:34.220
- How long will this take?
- A minute.

52:34.470 --> 52:35.638
Not bad.

52:36.556 --> 52:37.640
Here's our problem.

52:37.849 --> 52:40.518
The fire's lapping
up through the windows.

52:42.854 --> 52:44.105
Get down! Get down!

52:46.065 --> 52:47.984
What was that?

52:51.904 --> 52:54.031
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!

52:59.996 --> 53:03.457
Men trapped! We need help!
Bring a line!

53:07.712 --> 53:09.338
Pull them out, pull them out!

53:09.589 --> 53:12.676
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!

53:26.106 --> 53:28.317
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!

53:28.650 --> 53:30.319
Forward Command, go ahead.

53:30.527 --> 53:33.739
Explosion on 81, fire headed
toward elevator banks!

53:33.989 --> 53:35.991
We need more crews up here fast!

53:36.825 --> 53:40.412
- They need relief on 81. Hit it.
- They're on their way.

53:41.705 --> 53:42.748
Done!

53:42.998 --> 53:45.751
Tell Duncan to stop those
Tower Room people...

53:46.001 --> 53:49.838
...from using that express elevator,
or somebody'll get killed.

53:50.088 --> 53:51.507
Ring in a third alarm.

53:51.757 --> 53:54.426
I want some rescue squads
and some choppers here.

53:54.676 --> 53:57.095
We may need them
to get those people down.

53:57.346 --> 53:58.972
Come on, Park.

54:00.933 --> 54:02.309
I'll be on 81.

54:03.143 --> 54:05.020
The fire's moving toward
the main shaft.

54:05.229 --> 54:07.689
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.

54:13.153 --> 54:14.821
I don't like how you talk to me.

54:15.072 --> 54:16.323
- You drunk?
- Not yet.

54:16.573 --> 54:19.409
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.

54:19.618 --> 54:21.245
Running over budget
and out of money.

54:21.995 --> 54:25.667
Did you ask me then to shave
$2,000,000 off our electrical costs?

54:25.917 --> 54:27.377
Shut up and help these people!

54:27.627 --> 54:29.796
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.

54:30.296 --> 54:33.174
Did you encourage other
subcontractors to cut corners?

54:33.424 --> 54:37.136
Where did you save the other
4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?

54:51.359 --> 54:53.194
Please! Please!

54:53.820 --> 54:55.280
Hold everything.

54:55.530 --> 54:57.448
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

54:57.949 --> 55:00.076
Move back into the Promenade Room...

55:00.326 --> 55:03.204
...and we'll take you down by
the scenic elevator.

55:03.454 --> 55:07.083
Now these express elevators can be
activated by fire.

55:07.333 --> 55:09.878
And with the probability
of short circuits...

55:10.128 --> 55:13.673
...the cars might stop
on the floor where the fire is.

55:13.923 --> 55:18.428
So please, we'll use
the scenic elevators over there.

55:20.305 --> 55:22.849
For God's sake, get out of there!

55:24.184 --> 55:25.226
Please, back!

55:50.127 --> 55:51.504
It looks bad, Jack.

55:51.754 --> 55:53.464
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.

55:53.714 --> 55:54.965
The fire's spreading.

55:55.216 --> 55:57.676
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?

55:57.927 --> 56:01.096
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.

56:01.347 --> 56:04.308
Firemen, let's pull it down
before it falls down.

56:07.686 --> 56:10.314
Bring it out! Take it down!

56:10.606 --> 56:12.525
Empty all the water out.

56:15.986 --> 56:17.446
Chief, it's out of control.

56:17.655 --> 56:19.406
Bring in another line!

56:35.464 --> 56:37.132
Get another tank!

56:57.571 --> 56:58.947
Angela?

56:59.239 --> 57:00.824
Angela?

57:02.075 --> 57:03.326
Phillip?

57:04.035 --> 57:06.204
Phillip, open the door!

58:06.891 --> 58:09.018
What ideas can I use upstairs...

58:09.227 --> 58:11.562
...to explain where I've been
all this time?

58:11.812 --> 58:14.273
Well, what you might do is just...

58:14.524 --> 58:19.445
...walk right up to him and say,
"J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...

58:19.654 --> 58:23.407
...but my secretary
had an urgent personal problem."

58:25.243 --> 58:28.621
What happens if
he asks what the problem was?

58:29.330 --> 58:30.498
He won't.

58:33.876 --> 58:36.170
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?

58:36.420 --> 58:38.422
You make love with a girl...

58:38.673 --> 58:40.842
...and there's no visible evidence.

58:41.092 --> 58:43.970
Nothing to mark the event.

58:44.220 --> 58:48.224
Look at you. You look like you
could be going to church.

58:49.308 --> 58:50.935
In this outfit?

58:52.687 --> 58:54.272
I love you.

58:58.276 --> 59:00.528
Did you leave a cigarette burning?

59:04.282 --> 59:06.368
That's not a cigarette.

59:25.220 --> 59:26.597
Jesus!

59:33.770 --> 59:36.190
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.

59:44.990 --> 59:46.033
Dan?

59:52.414 --> 59:53.707
Right.

59:56.084 --> 59:59.338
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.

01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:05.010
There's nothing to worry about.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.096
We'll just sit tight
and wait till they get here.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:09.890
I won't panic.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.267
Not to worry, baby.

01:00:18.483 --> 01:00:20.985
Please, just join the end of the line.

01:00:22.153 --> 01:00:23.780
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.866
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.

01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:30.036
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.

01:00:30.286 --> 01:00:33.248
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.293
Now, only 12 at a time.

01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:42.090
I'm sorry. That's it.

01:00:44.425 --> 01:00:46.719
We'll be in the next group, maybe.

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.763
It won't be too long.

01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:51.683
What's she doing on 87?

01:00:55.103 --> 01:00:57.438
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.

01:00:58.439 --> 01:00:59.482
Harry.

01:01:01.484 --> 01:01:02.569
Jernigan.

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:05.572
What?

01:01:05.822 --> 01:01:08.366
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!

01:01:08.575 --> 01:01:11.703
How do you expect her to hear
a phone call? She's deaf!

01:01:12.078 --> 01:01:13.997
Sure, the kids can hear!

01:01:14.205 --> 01:01:17.542
I don't know, maybe they
were in the shower when you called.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:20.044
You stay there.
I'll get them down!

01:01:20.295 --> 01:01:23.631
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!

01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:27.177
<i>- We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.</i>

01:01:27.427 --> 01:01:28.637
I'll get them down.

01:01:33.225 --> 01:01:35.060
I'll give you a hand.

01:01:50.951 --> 01:01:52.328
Turn your face away.

01:02:16.644 --> 01:02:18.896
There never were any firemen,
were there?

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.693
I said that to make it easier on you.

01:02:25.819 --> 01:02:28.239
I switched off the phones.

01:02:29.698 --> 01:02:31.367
There's no way to call out.

01:02:36.038 --> 01:02:38.249
Nobody knows we're up here.

01:02:40.836 --> 01:02:43.672
Well, I always did want to die in bed.

01:02:48.927 --> 01:02:50.720
Nobody's going to die.

01:02:53.098 --> 01:02:56.560
At least they'll never find out
about us, will they?

01:03:25.046 --> 01:03:27.883
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.

01:03:34.139 --> 01:03:35.557
Don't go!

01:03:37.475 --> 01:03:40.770
I'll be back with
the whole fire department.

01:06:38.993 --> 01:06:42.038
- You all right?
- The mother and children are in there.

01:06:42.288 --> 01:06:44.582
- Don't worry. We'll get them out.
- Wait!

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:47.210
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.630
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Give it a kick.

01:06:58.513 --> 01:07:00.139
I'll take the back.

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:32.298
I got Mrs. Allbright.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.469
Anybody in here?!

01:08:02.786 --> 01:08:06.040
It's okay, kid. It's okay.
Come on.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:27.853
He's okay.

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:30.481
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:32.983
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.611
Anybody else?

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.738
My sister. Where's Angela?

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.242
He'll get her.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.796
Angela?

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:56.966
Angela?

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.788
Angela, where are you?

01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:41.011
It's gonna be okay, Angela.

01:09:54.567 --> 01:09:56.152
Thank God!

01:10:35.858 --> 01:10:38.110
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.

01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:39.529
- All right!
- That's it.

01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:41.405
Don't crush.

01:10:52.959 --> 01:10:55.212
It'll take hours
to get everyone down.

01:10:55.462 --> 01:11:00.008
Those of us with stout hearts and
trim waistlines should use the stairs.

01:11:00.259 --> 01:11:03.929
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.

01:11:24.324 --> 01:11:26.660
It's closer than they told us.

01:11:28.579 --> 01:11:31.623
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.

01:11:47.347 --> 01:11:48.640
Carlos!

01:11:50.017 --> 01:11:52.144
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.

01:11:52.394 --> 01:11:53.562
Is it stuck?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.357
Here, let me try to kick it.

01:12:01.904 --> 01:12:04.573
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:38.399
Battalion 38
responding to fourth alarm.

01:12:40.151 --> 01:12:42.195
Where are those choppers, Kappy?

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:44.030
Navy's been alerted.

01:12:47.116 --> 01:12:50.078
Why do they make these goddamn
things so heavy?

01:12:50.328 --> 01:12:51.746
You want it easy, chief?

01:12:51.955 --> 01:12:56.167
They should design a survival suit
for us like for football players.

01:12:56.417 --> 01:12:58.628
Who pays to see us play?

01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:06.135
Let's go to work.

01:13:07.762 --> 01:13:10.348
I need two men up the stairwell
to the tower.

01:13:10.598 --> 01:13:13.226
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.

01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:18.274
Okay, you got it.

01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:21.360
Timmy, I want you with me.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:24.947
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?

01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:27.199
Glass will be sailing everywhere.

01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:31.078
Tell the police to move
those barricades four blocks back.

01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:33.038
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.

01:13:40.963 --> 01:13:43.132
Yo! Security guard.
Anyone here?

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:52.683
Hello. Security.

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:03.903
Say, kitty, almost missed you.

01:14:12.036 --> 01:14:13.704
Keep away from the walls.

01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:17.041
There's fire on the other side.

01:14:30.388 --> 01:14:31.848
Wait a minute.

01:14:36.436 --> 01:14:38.813
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!

01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:01.044
Oh, my God!

01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:00.104
Is there any way you can get down?

01:16:00.646 --> 01:16:02.481
I think I can.

01:16:02.732 --> 01:16:03.816
Phillip!

01:16:04.525 --> 01:16:06.110
Let him try.

01:16:07.653 --> 01:16:08.988
There's no other way.

01:16:37.934 --> 01:16:39.810
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.

01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:41.604
That part's easy.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.156
Come on, boy. Easy does it.

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.242
Get your foot over there.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:00.749
Ease down.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.794
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!

01:17:18.308 --> 01:17:22.062
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.

01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:23.480
Easy.

01:17:24.523 --> 01:17:25.774
Easy.

01:17:28.235 --> 01:17:29.945
Don't look down!

01:17:33.574 --> 01:17:34.950
Come on.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.494
I gotcha. I gotcha.

01:17:47.171 --> 01:17:51.842
We were supposed to have fire drills,
but nobody ever told me anything.

01:17:52.217 --> 01:17:56.054
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.

01:18:01.394 --> 01:18:03.313
It's going to be all right.

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.755
It's going to be all right.

01:18:56.574 --> 01:18:57.951
You all right?

01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:00.662
You know, I had a...

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:04.916
I got up, but I'll have trouble
getting down. Can you help me?

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:09.420
Could you just hold on
around my neck, real tight?

01:19:12.633 --> 01:19:14.468
Come on. Give it a try.

01:19:17.221 --> 01:19:21.141
Just put your arms around me,
and you tell me what to do.

01:19:21.392 --> 01:19:23.185
Put her legs down.

01:19:23.936 --> 01:19:27.439
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.

01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:33.821
Just hold on tight.

01:19:34.029 --> 01:19:35.447
Hold on.

01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:19.074
Hold on tight, now.

01:20:26.458 --> 01:20:27.918
It's gonna be okay now.

01:20:33.256 --> 01:20:34.716
Hold on!

01:20:35.008 --> 01:20:36.384
Easy now.

01:20:36.843 --> 01:20:39.346
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!

01:20:39.596 --> 01:20:41.598
Get your arms around my neck!

01:20:41.806 --> 01:20:43.058
Thattagirl.

01:20:54.194 --> 01:20:55.362
Nurse?

01:21:10.627 --> 01:21:12.963
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!

01:21:14.297 --> 01:21:16.216
Take it slowly, now.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.357
You've got about a foot to go.

01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:16.694
Feel around with your feet now.

01:22:16.944 --> 01:22:18.196
Can you see it?

01:22:23.784 --> 01:22:27.121
Hold on to that pole
and grab ahold of my belt.

01:22:36.714 --> 01:22:38.633
Try to get your hand over there.

01:22:44.681 --> 01:22:47.142
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.

01:22:48.602 --> 01:22:50.270
Try to swing now.

01:22:51.772 --> 01:22:53.815
Just try to pendulum.

01:22:55.067 --> 01:22:56.527
Can you swing?

01:22:58.737 --> 01:23:01.740
Come on.
Just get to me over here.

01:23:02.407 --> 01:23:04.243
Mrs. Mueller!

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:15.295
Are you all right?

01:23:19.007 --> 01:23:20.926
All right, let's go.

01:23:40.195 --> 01:23:42.030
Come on. Come on.

01:23:46.368 --> 01:23:47.828
I'm coming.

01:23:48.537 --> 01:23:49.913
I'm coming.

01:24:02.594 --> 01:24:03.720
You okay?

01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:10.560
Nobody's gonna get down this way.

01:24:14.105 --> 01:24:16.399
Oh, God! We're cut off.

01:24:17.317 --> 01:24:19.569
Well, the only way is up.

01:24:19.819 --> 01:24:21.196
Come on, let's go.

01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:38.838
Chief O'Hallorhan?

01:24:39.088 --> 01:24:41.841
Inside, security phone on the right.

01:24:50.391 --> 01:24:53.520
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.

01:24:58.399 --> 01:24:59.484
Can't we go down?

01:24:59.734 --> 01:25:03.571
The fire's below us. We gotta go up,
underneath the Promenade Room.

01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.989
Come on!

01:25:16.293 --> 01:25:17.503
Tim, get that phone.

01:25:17.753 --> 01:25:20.214
Check your ventilating
systems over here.

01:25:21.882 --> 01:25:23.843
I'll send up another truck company.

01:25:24.051 --> 01:25:26.303
Pull this ceiling,
and vent that other side.

01:25:26.512 --> 01:25:28.806
It's the copter air-control officer.

01:25:29.056 --> 01:25:31.892
Thank you. Jack, I know you've
been hitting it.

01:25:32.142 --> 01:25:34.311
I'm getting relief
for you and your men.

01:25:40.609 --> 01:25:42.152
Who am I speaking to?

01:25:42.361 --> 01:25:44.780
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.

01:25:44.989 --> 01:25:47.491
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:52.037
Right away. Our communications will
be near the Forward Command center.

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.957
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.

01:25:55.165 --> 01:25:57.376
Then, sir, we'll just trot
up the stairs.

01:25:57.585 --> 01:26:00.337
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?

01:26:01.088 --> 01:26:02.590
Standing by in the lobby.

01:26:02.798 --> 01:26:04.216
Thank you.

01:26:33.205 --> 01:26:35.373
This ain't gonna help any!

01:26:41.338 --> 01:26:44.382
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:48.011
It's a fire door. It's over
2.5 inches thick.

01:26:48.929 --> 01:26:50.722
I could crawl through the duct.

01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:53.558
Will we be able to go with you?

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:58.021
That leads to a pipe shaft
that's 135 floors straight down.

01:27:01.858 --> 01:27:06.780
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.

01:28:17.351 --> 01:28:18.936
All right, I'll tell him.

01:28:21.564 --> 01:28:23.941
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.

01:28:24.192 --> 01:28:25.818
Well, it's still below us.

01:28:26.027 --> 01:28:29.572
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.

01:28:48.342 --> 01:28:49.426
Come here!

01:28:50.677 --> 01:28:52.930
The master generator's blown.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.267
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.

01:29:09.154 --> 01:29:10.656
What happened?

01:29:15.285 --> 01:29:16.954
Where the hell are we?

01:29:33.262 --> 01:29:37.140
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?

01:29:39.935 --> 01:29:41.728
The whole system's failed.

01:29:42.187 --> 01:29:45.274
What's the last report
on the firemen getting here?

01:29:45.899 --> 01:29:47.526
Are they on their way?

01:29:49.904 --> 01:29:51.948
Hold on to me a second.

01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:33.990
Hold on!

01:30:37.619 --> 01:30:39.329
Christ!
That's one of our men!

01:30:39.579 --> 01:30:40.955
Oh, God!

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:47.128
Go down by rope.
Better get it.

01:30:47.378 --> 01:30:48.671
Sir?

01:30:48.922 --> 01:30:53.510
We'll rappel down to 65 and use
the top of that elevator as an exit.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.387
Why not pry open the doors
at this level?

01:30:57.889 --> 01:30:59.767
I don't think so.

01:31:00.017 --> 01:31:01.519
I can't make it.

01:31:01.769 --> 01:31:04.522
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.

01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:09.568
Then you better go first.

01:31:09.818 --> 01:31:13.280
That way, when you fall,
you won't take any of us with you.

01:31:25.751 --> 01:31:26.961
Let's go to work.

01:31:37.555 --> 01:31:39.723
Check all rooms
in that corridor.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.893
Check this room.

01:31:47.773 --> 01:31:49.567
Tear it down.

01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:51.922
See? Just like we
taught you in training.

01:32:54.591 --> 01:32:56.092
Open it up.

01:33:06.394 --> 01:33:08.396
Of course I read you!

01:33:08.647 --> 01:33:12.067
I don't know where he is,
but if I see him, I'll tell him.

01:33:13.985 --> 01:33:17.197
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.

01:33:17.447 --> 01:33:20.492
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.

01:33:20.742 --> 01:33:23.037
The Navy flight commander needs you.

01:33:23.287 --> 01:33:24.914
Just walk 65 floors down?

01:33:25.164 --> 01:33:28.626
Only five. A freight elevator
on 60's running auxiliary power.

01:33:28.834 --> 01:33:30.920
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.

01:33:31.128 --> 01:33:34.507
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.

01:33:34.757 --> 01:33:36.092
Oh, Mike...

01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:39.053
This one of your men?

01:33:40.763 --> 01:33:42.390
"Dan Bigelow."
Nope.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.475
Must be a civilian.

01:33:51.274 --> 01:33:53.192
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.

01:34:20.303 --> 01:34:21.345
Look!

01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:23.598
There's another one there!

01:34:51.168 --> 01:34:54.254
Carlos, give me that security phone,
will you?

01:34:54.504 --> 01:34:55.923
How'd you get in here?

01:34:56.173 --> 01:34:58.175
I'll give it to you later.

01:34:58.675 --> 01:35:00.135
Give me O'Hallorhan.

01:35:01.136 --> 01:35:02.179
Anybody'll do.

01:35:02.429 --> 01:35:06.225
Listen, the south stairwell is
blocked. Cement, for chrissake!

01:35:06.475 --> 01:35:09.311
Can you send somebody up
to break it loose?

01:35:10.437 --> 01:35:12.564
They're on their way?
How...?

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:19.863
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.

01:35:20.072 --> 01:35:21.782
She's still in the apartment.

01:35:22.032 --> 01:35:25.077
I'm sure the fire
didn't get up that high yet.

01:35:25.327 --> 01:35:27.120
She'll be all right.

01:35:33.085 --> 01:35:34.920
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

01:35:35.170 --> 01:35:38.465
- How're you doing?
- We're fine. Glad to see you.

01:35:38.715 --> 01:35:41.760
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.

01:35:51.521 --> 01:35:53.857
We're gonna have to blow that thing.

01:35:59.696 --> 01:36:01.364
Mrs. Mueller?

01:36:01.614 --> 01:36:03.241
It's Mr. Roberts!

01:36:06.035 --> 01:36:07.829
Mrs. Mueller! Phillip!

01:36:08.079 --> 01:36:11.332
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.

01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:13.251
Get everybody clear.

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:16.212
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?

01:36:18.756 --> 01:36:20.091
Understood!

01:36:24.721 --> 01:36:27.849
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.

01:36:29.559 --> 01:36:32.103
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.

01:36:32.312 --> 01:36:34.898
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.

01:36:37.483 --> 01:36:38.902
Okay, get down low.

01:36:45.074 --> 01:36:48.995
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.

01:36:49.245 --> 01:36:50.538
Blow a hole in anything.

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.804
Here, shine this on the bag for me.

01:37:07.014 --> 01:37:08.849
That's it. Keep it up here.

01:37:11.936 --> 01:37:13.729
Is there gonna be a bang?

01:37:13.979 --> 01:37:17.691
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.

01:37:20.236 --> 01:37:22.696
Okay, everybody ready?

01:37:41.006 --> 01:37:42.716
Good going, Brian.

01:37:46.554 --> 01:37:47.930
You all right?

01:37:58.983 --> 01:38:01.735
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?

01:38:01.986 --> 01:38:05.949
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.

01:38:23.174 --> 01:38:24.843
Everyone, listen!

01:38:25.135 --> 01:38:27.220
- Hold it down!
- Listen!

01:38:29.514 --> 01:38:32.976
I've been informed
that there's no possibility...

01:38:33.185 --> 01:38:35.770
...of using this stairway to get out.

01:38:36.021 --> 01:38:38.273
Now, I'm sorry.

01:38:42.444 --> 01:38:43.612
Patty...

01:38:44.446 --> 01:38:47.365
There's still a chance
we can get out of here.

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.744
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.

01:38:50.994 --> 01:38:54.247
Are you coming or not?

01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:03.632
If you have to wait for permission
to save your own life, go ahead.

01:39:04.132 --> 01:39:06.760
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...

01:39:44.173 --> 01:39:45.341
Come on!

01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:46.592
Come on!

01:39:48.177 --> 01:39:51.597
Let's go. You guys, hose the ceiling.

01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:55.142
You two, in there!

01:40:00.022 --> 01:40:04.402
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.

01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:07.446
You sure you're all right?

01:40:09.824 --> 01:40:13.619
Those helicopters, they'll get
us out of here, won't they?

01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:16.622
Sure they will
if there's not too much wind.

01:40:18.291 --> 01:40:19.959
Some party.

01:40:30.637 --> 01:40:32.681
Can I get you anything else?

01:41:02.711 --> 01:41:07.007
The choppers are here, but the winds
make a landing attempt too risky.

01:41:07.257 --> 01:41:09.885
Get some men on top of
the Peerless Building...

01:41:10.135 --> 01:41:12.554
...and get a breeches buoy
to the Promenade Room.

01:41:12.804 --> 01:41:15.224
We can't shoot a line that far
in this wind.

01:41:15.432 --> 01:41:17.643
Why not shoot it from a chopper?

01:41:17.893 --> 01:41:19.603
I'll get right on it.

01:41:22.564 --> 01:41:25.651
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.

01:41:25.859 --> 01:41:29.404
By the time I got to him,
he was covered with hot stuff.

01:41:54.305 --> 01:41:57.767
Pretty ridiculous spectacle,
right?

01:41:57.976 --> 01:42:00.895
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.

01:42:02.647 --> 01:42:06.860
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.

01:42:07.110 --> 01:42:08.820
Get quietly drunk.

01:42:11.447 --> 01:42:14.868
If you're responsible for this,
I know what you must be feeling.

01:42:15.118 --> 01:42:17.370
You don't know the meaning
of the word.

01:42:17.787 --> 01:42:19.205
- Responsible?
- Feeling!

01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:23.001
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.

01:42:23.251 --> 01:42:26.921
Duncans are big in that department,
at least on the surface.

01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:31.342
That's not fair! I don't think
it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.

01:42:31.551 --> 01:42:35.763
Sometimes, when you turn
the exact same phrase...

01:42:36.014 --> 01:42:38.057
...lift an eyebrow
in the exact same way...

01:42:38.266 --> 01:42:40.768
...I see and I hear your father.

01:42:40.977 --> 01:42:42.729
The two of you, one!

01:42:42.979 --> 01:42:46.691
Like a big tree and a little tree
in its shade, where the acorn fell.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.031
Roger, I came over here to you
because I thought you might need me.

01:42:56.785 --> 01:42:58.037
Right now...

01:42:59.288 --> 01:43:01.040
...what I need most...

01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:02.833
...is this.

01:43:08.756 --> 01:43:12.760
I promised myself if I ever saw you
again, I'd make a full confession.

01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:14.345
No, but thank you.

01:43:14.595 --> 01:43:18.140
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.

01:43:18.933 --> 01:43:20.601
You're penniless...

01:43:20.851 --> 01:43:23.354
...you have no villa
in the south of France...

01:43:23.562 --> 01:43:26.857
...no antiques coming, no paintings.

01:43:27.107 --> 01:43:28.734
But, Harlee, I don't care.

01:43:31.278 --> 01:43:34.573
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.

01:43:34.823 --> 01:43:38.118
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.

01:43:38.327 --> 01:43:40.621
But you see,
your heart isn't in it.

01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:43.207
How can you cheat people
effectively...

01:43:43.457 --> 01:43:45.626
...if you don't enjoy cheating them?

01:43:46.001 --> 01:43:50.798
I came here to sell you 1000 shares
in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!

01:43:51.465 --> 01:43:52.508
Is it a good investment?

01:43:52.716 --> 01:43:55.427
There is no
Greater Anaheim Power and Light.

01:43:55.678 --> 01:43:57.513
Only the certificate I had printed.

01:43:57.763 --> 01:44:01.768
I think you'd have admired
the artwork. Beautiful engraving.

01:44:01.977 --> 01:44:03.520
I'd like to see it.

01:44:05.355 --> 01:44:06.648
It's in my jacket.

01:44:06.857 --> 01:44:10.402
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.

01:44:10.819 --> 01:44:12.070
You see what I mean?

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:15.615
I can't even deliver
a phony stock certificate.

01:44:18.869 --> 01:44:20.370
Did you hear what I said?

01:44:22.163 --> 01:44:23.665
Every word.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.585
Then tell me you're shocked...

01:44:26.835 --> 01:44:28.670
...or at least disappointed.

01:44:28.879 --> 01:44:31.464
- But I'm not.
- You must be!

01:44:32.173 --> 01:44:34.175
Harlee, I'm not.

01:44:49.858 --> 01:44:51.484
I'll be right back.

01:44:53.028 --> 01:44:55.488
Give me a few minutes with Doug,
will you, dear?

01:44:55.739 --> 01:44:57.115
Sure.

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:10.253
Will Giddings is dead.

01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:14.717
He died 20 minutes ago.

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:20.848
Oh, boy.

01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:28.231
I wonder how many more
will be dead tomorrow?

01:45:28.481 --> 01:45:30.358
I thought we were
building something...

01:45:30.608 --> 01:45:33.611
...where people could work,
live and be safe.

01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:38.199
If you had to cut costs, why didn't
you cut floors instead of corners?

01:45:39.283 --> 01:45:40.910
Now listen.

01:45:41.118 --> 01:45:46.249
Any decisions that were made for the
use of alternate building materials...

01:45:46.457 --> 01:45:50.711
...were made because I, as a builder,
have a right to make those decisions.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.839
If I remain within the building code,
and goddamn it, I did!

01:45:54.048 --> 01:45:56.300
Oh, here we go again!

01:45:56.509 --> 01:45:57.927
The building code. Come on.

01:45:58.135 --> 01:46:00.763
That's a standard cop-out
when you're in trouble!

01:46:00.972 --> 01:46:03.057
I was crawling around up there.

01:46:03.307 --> 01:46:05.852
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!

01:46:06.102 --> 01:46:09.522
Corridors without fire doors
and the sprinklers won't work.

01:46:09.772 --> 01:46:12.817
And an electrical system
that's good for what?

01:46:13.067 --> 01:46:15.319
I mean, it's good for starting fires!

01:46:16.153 --> 01:46:18.656
Where was I
when all this was going on?

01:46:18.906 --> 01:46:23.245
Because I'm just as guilty as you
and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!

01:46:24.621 --> 01:46:27.040
What do they call it
when you kill people?

01:46:48.228 --> 01:46:50.147
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.

01:46:50.397 --> 01:46:53.358
- What happened?
- Part of the central corridor just blew.

01:46:53.609 --> 01:46:55.068
We've got in the fifth alarm.

01:46:56.403 --> 01:46:57.571
The helicopters?

01:46:57.779 --> 01:47:02.618
It's too windy. We'll set up the
breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.

01:47:04.119 --> 01:47:05.412
What can we do to help?

01:47:06.246 --> 01:47:08.665
Move your combustible material
away from the window.

01:47:10.167 --> 01:47:11.627
Okay, gotcha.

01:47:25.432 --> 01:47:28.101
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.

01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:30.395
Jake, give me a hand.

01:48:09.644 --> 01:48:10.979
Did you reach her?

01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:12.939
The phones are all out.

01:48:13.857 --> 01:48:17.318
Just a little while longer,
and we'll all be home together.

01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:21.072
If only I could have talked to her.

01:48:21.656 --> 01:48:24.200
Let her know we were thinking of her.

01:48:25.869 --> 01:48:29.831
Told her how precious she is to us.

01:48:34.085 --> 01:48:36.504
She's still such a child.

01:48:37.797 --> 01:48:41.718
She doesn't even know where I keep
the key to the safety deposit box.

01:48:41.968 --> 01:48:44.013
How will she be able to get into it?

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.725
I mean...

01:48:49.226 --> 01:48:50.686
...if she should have to.

01:48:54.523 --> 01:48:56.942
The things you think of.

01:48:58.235 --> 01:48:59.862
Do you wanna help me?

01:49:07.244 --> 01:49:09.914
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.

01:49:10.164 --> 01:49:12.583
We're gonna try for a landing.

01:49:12.833 --> 01:49:14.668
Get Roberts.

01:49:21.008 --> 01:49:24.511
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.263
We're gonna start airlifting.

01:49:26.472 --> 01:49:28.015
Will do.

01:49:31.602 --> 01:49:33.562
Put these over there.

01:49:33.812 --> 01:49:36.190
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.359
Give me that brandy snifter too.

01:49:38.609 --> 01:49:41.403
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.

01:49:41.654 --> 01:49:44.615
We'll send the kids out first,
then the women.

01:49:44.865 --> 01:49:46.825
Number these up to 100 or so.

01:49:47.076 --> 01:49:48.744
High-rise roulette.

01:49:48.994 --> 01:49:51.789
High-rise roulette. That's right.

01:49:52.998 --> 01:49:56.211
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.

01:49:56.461 --> 01:49:58.296
I'll go tell everybody.

01:49:58.547 --> 01:50:00.382
Pass those out when you're ready.

01:50:28.118 --> 01:50:32.247
There'll be a lot of wind up there,
so everybody stay in one group.

01:50:32.497 --> 01:50:33.707
Come on.

01:50:50.056 --> 01:50:51.683
Stay back, stay back!

01:50:57.314 --> 01:50:58.523
Look out!

01:51:42.568 --> 01:51:44.445
Roberts! Roberts!

01:51:44.695 --> 01:51:47.156
Chief O'Hallorhan
wants to speak to you.

01:51:47.406 --> 01:51:50.660
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!

01:51:55.957 --> 01:51:57.750
Here he is now.

01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:03.965
Roberts, I know those pilots
are dead, and I...

01:52:04.632 --> 01:52:06.467
God, it was just awful up there.

01:52:08.135 --> 01:52:11.097
Listen, our best chance now
is the breeches buoy.

01:52:11.347 --> 01:52:13.724
I told my two firemen
to knock out a window.

01:52:13.975 --> 01:52:16.144
We'll try to shoot a line
from a chopper.

01:52:24.236 --> 01:52:27.072
Hey, one of you guys
got a pair of clippers?

01:52:27.322 --> 01:52:30.909
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.

01:52:43.005 --> 01:52:46.133
Step back. The firemen
are gonna knock out the windows.

01:52:46.508 --> 01:52:48.677
Step back and you won't get hurt.

01:54:39.832 --> 01:54:42.293
May I have your attention, please?

01:54:43.627 --> 01:54:46.672
We've activated a gravity brake on
that outside elevator.

01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:50.426
There's no power to bring it back up,
but at least we can get 12 people out.

01:54:50.634 --> 01:54:52.219
Which 12?

01:54:52.386 --> 01:54:55.556
The same group that was
up on the roof and two additions.

01:54:55.764 --> 01:54:58.976
The woman who saved the children's
lives and a fireman!

01:54:59.226 --> 01:55:01.478
I want a trained man in there.

01:55:03.397 --> 01:55:05.232
All right, let's move it out!

01:55:13.115 --> 01:55:14.241
Marge!

01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:17.328
Take this. Take it!
You can get out! Go on.

01:55:17.536 --> 01:55:18.996
What are you doing?

01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:22.333
I'm sorry.

01:55:26.253 --> 01:55:28.547
I want you out of here.

01:55:28.756 --> 01:55:31.926
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?

01:55:32.176 --> 01:55:34.178
It's the only way you can help me.

01:55:34.386 --> 01:55:35.888
Help me.

01:55:49.236 --> 01:55:51.863
If you asked me
to go to the North Pole...

01:55:52.113 --> 01:55:55.700
...or even the cliffs of Mendocino,
I'd go.

01:55:56.493 --> 01:55:58.828
What if I ask you tomorrow?

01:56:08.713 --> 01:56:09.881
Please.

01:56:13.718 --> 01:56:16.137
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.

01:56:16.388 --> 01:56:17.806
Come on, Phillip.

01:56:20.809 --> 01:56:23.353
I'll never let you go anywhere
without me again.

01:56:23.603 --> 01:56:25.355
I don't want to.

01:56:25.730 --> 01:56:27.190
Ever again.

01:56:30.569 --> 01:56:33.071
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.

01:56:33.321 --> 01:56:35.115
We're still a lady short.

01:56:36.032 --> 01:56:38.201
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.

01:56:38.451 --> 01:56:40.537
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.

01:56:40.745 --> 01:56:43.665
Have I ever broken a promise to you?

01:56:46.251 --> 01:56:48.044
Good luck, honey.

01:56:49.546 --> 01:56:50.589
Please.

01:56:52.382 --> 01:56:54.092
All set, everyone?

01:57:03.769 --> 01:57:05.146
Okay, here we go.

01:58:47.332 --> 01:58:49.001
Out of sight!

01:58:50.627 --> 01:58:52.337
Yeah, it's coming.

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.550
Let's untie this, take it off,
pull in the rest of the line!

01:58:56.758 --> 01:58:59.678
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.

01:59:12.441 --> 01:59:13.817
All right,
hold it right there!

01:59:14.067 --> 01:59:17.154
Bring in another 20 feet
of that main line.

01:59:26.748 --> 01:59:27.999
That's it.

01:59:29.542 --> 01:59:31.252
All right, bring in a little more!

01:59:31.502 --> 01:59:34.464
That's it. Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.

01:59:41.763 --> 01:59:43.264
Watch your heads!

01:59:46.893 --> 01:59:49.771
Grab it! Take it back and secure it!

01:59:53.066 --> 01:59:55.527
All right, let it go!
Let it go!

01:59:55.735 --> 01:59:58.321
All right, go on!
Take it out!

02:00:11.042 --> 02:00:12.669
Okay, take ahold.

02:00:23.513 --> 02:00:25.682
How about the main line?
Secured?

02:00:25.932 --> 02:00:27.433
Good!

02:01:17.234 --> 02:01:18.527
Chief!

02:01:22.364 --> 02:01:24.283
Explosion above 110...

02:01:24.533 --> 02:01:28.537
...blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:35.419
- How many people in it?
- Loaded. I'd say about 12.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.345
What're you gonna go?

02:01:50.185 --> 02:01:51.478
Flaker.

02:01:52.312 --> 02:01:54.814
- Flaker!
- Sir?

02:01:56.358 --> 02:01:59.945
Can you give me a chopper
with a winch and some cable?

02:02:00.195 --> 02:02:02.447
Have them pick me up on the
Peerless Building.

02:02:02.697 --> 02:02:03.782
Got it.

02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:10.247
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.

02:02:10.539 --> 02:02:13.375
Drop it down to the deck
by the chopper.

02:02:22.259 --> 02:02:24.427
Mommy, Mommy!

02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:37.148
I won't cry if you won't cry.

02:02:42.737 --> 02:02:43.780
It's all right.

02:03:00.882 --> 02:03:03.426
Yeah, take it up out of there.

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:11.142
Pull it. Come on!

02:03:12.143 --> 02:03:13.644
Tie it over there.

02:03:27.909 --> 02:03:29.410
Okay, let her go!

02:03:32.163 --> 02:03:33.873
Look out below!

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:39.921
Come on.

02:03:41.464 --> 02:03:43.466
Okay, that's it.

02:03:52.767 --> 02:03:54.644
All right!
There's one in there!

02:03:55.019 --> 02:03:56.479
Come on! Pull it in!

02:04:06.698 --> 02:04:09.910
All right, let's haul
that chair in! Come on!

02:04:12.704 --> 02:04:13.914
That's it!

02:04:19.127 --> 02:04:21.004
All right, keep it going!

02:04:21.713 --> 02:04:23.924
All right, hold it right there.

02:04:25.384 --> 02:04:26.593
Who's next in order?

02:04:27.052 --> 02:04:28.387
I am. I am!

02:04:28.679 --> 02:04:31.056
- Come ahead!
- I can't do that.

02:04:31.306 --> 02:04:32.683
Yes, you can.

02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.440
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

02:04:40.691 --> 02:04:42.276
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!

02:04:42.484 --> 02:04:44.778
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!

02:04:46.488 --> 02:04:48.115
Don't let go!

02:04:50.701 --> 02:04:52.286
Don't let go of me!

02:05:25.778 --> 02:05:27.238
Get me out, please!

02:05:27.447 --> 02:05:29.199
Hold it right there.

02:05:38.875 --> 02:05:40.960
Okay, lower the cable.

02:05:46.174 --> 02:05:47.800
Grab that hook!

02:05:48.051 --> 02:05:49.219
Steady.

02:05:51.179 --> 02:05:52.764
What about the torch?

02:05:53.431 --> 02:05:55.058
Lash it tight.

02:06:00.563 --> 02:06:04.025
<i>- This is O'Hallorhan.
- We read you, chief.</i>

02:06:04.317 --> 02:06:06.361
Pick me up with the hook...

02:06:06.611 --> 02:06:09.864
...and set me down on the
scenic elevator.

02:06:10.073 --> 02:06:15.203
Then you'll pick up the elevator
and gently set it down on the street.

02:06:15.537 --> 02:06:16.996
Can you handle the weight?

02:06:17.247 --> 02:06:21.751
<i>I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.</i>

02:06:41.438 --> 02:06:43.023
Watch it!

02:06:47.903 --> 02:06:49.488
Take it away!

02:07:19.101 --> 02:07:21.186
How much time do we have?

02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:25.149
I wish I knew.

02:07:25.858 --> 02:07:28.694
Goddamn it, Jim,
you built the place!

02:07:34.366 --> 02:07:37.704
I just don't think that
all of us are gonna make it.

02:08:35.262 --> 02:08:37.305
Well, I guess I'm next.

02:08:37.973 --> 02:08:40.225
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.

02:08:44.062 --> 02:08:46.064
Come on. I'll see you soon.

02:08:54.699 --> 02:08:56.284
I love you.

02:09:00.121 --> 02:09:01.706
Let it go!

02:09:59.014 --> 02:10:00.515
You think this'll hold it?

02:10:00.766 --> 02:10:04.186
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.

02:10:12.903 --> 02:10:14.988
- What's your number?
- 68.

02:10:15.155 --> 02:10:16.198
47.

02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:07.162
Here, Mrs. Ramsay,
you'll be all right now.

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:11.125
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.

02:13:11.333 --> 02:13:13.586
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.

02:13:13.794 --> 02:13:17.798
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.

02:13:18.591 --> 02:13:19.675
Let's go.

02:13:27.766 --> 02:13:29.476
Oh, my God, you're all right!

02:13:29.727 --> 02:13:31.980
Thank God you're all right!

02:13:34.065 --> 02:13:35.108
Watch the ladder.

02:14:20.153 --> 02:14:21.404
Hey, Mike...

02:14:21.696 --> 02:14:23.698
...deputy wants to see you.

02:14:35.835 --> 02:14:39.339
Mike, we've been checking
the situation in the Promenade Room.

02:14:40.048 --> 02:14:43.302
We figure they've got
17 or 18 minutes left, if that.

02:14:43.553 --> 02:14:46.514
It'll take more than 3 hours
to get them down by breeches buoy.

02:14:46.722 --> 02:14:49.183
They'll die up there
if something's not done.

02:14:49.433 --> 02:14:51.018
We might have the answer.

02:14:51.269 --> 02:14:55.022
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.

02:14:55.231 --> 02:14:58.234
The structural strength
of the joists in that room...

02:14:58.484 --> 02:15:01.070
...could definitely
withstand the explosion.

02:15:03.531 --> 02:15:04.615
What explosion?

02:15:06.659 --> 02:15:08.870
Chief, we've got the copter ready.

02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:10.746
Wait a minute. We'll handle that.

02:15:10.997 --> 02:15:12.915
Just get back to your job.

02:15:15.042 --> 02:15:16.460
Yes, sir.

02:15:18.588 --> 02:15:19.630
What explosion?

02:15:19.881 --> 02:15:22.967
We can blow the tanks
two floors above the Promenade Room.

02:15:23.217 --> 02:15:27.305
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.

02:15:30.558 --> 02:15:33.978
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.

02:15:34.353 --> 02:15:37.023
You could kill everybody up there.

02:15:37.231 --> 02:15:38.608
I don't think so.

02:15:39.817 --> 02:15:40.860
You don't think?

02:15:41.068 --> 02:15:44.238
When you take into account the stress
factors, the design...

02:15:44.447 --> 02:15:46.824
Wait a minute. Just hold it.

02:15:47.074 --> 02:15:48.951
We've already made the decision.

02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:52.997
Someone has got to go up there,
rig the charges and blow them.

02:15:53.248 --> 02:15:57.586
There's only two people qualified
for that. You and Conners.

02:15:57.836 --> 02:16:02.758
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.

02:16:03.675 --> 02:16:07.346
Under the circumstances,
we can't order you to go up there.

02:16:07.596 --> 02:16:10.057
I'm just laying it out for you.

02:16:11.308 --> 02:16:12.434
But you...

02:16:13.810 --> 02:16:15.437
You see how it is, don't you?

02:16:19.650 --> 02:16:21.360
How do I get back down?

02:16:27.491 --> 02:16:29.660
Oh, shit!

02:16:56.352 --> 02:16:57.646
The women are gone.

02:16:59.064 --> 02:17:01.148
We are going next.

02:17:12.912 --> 02:17:14.998
You've all got numbers.

02:17:15.206 --> 02:17:17.333
And you're gonna take your turn.

02:17:17.916 --> 02:17:20.545
And if it's any consolation...

02:17:23.255 --> 02:17:27.718
...I'll be the last one out of here
along with my son-in-law.

02:17:38.062 --> 02:17:40.940
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.

02:17:44.192 --> 02:17:46.404
You got about 15 minutes.

02:17:47.572 --> 02:17:49.531
Now, they want to try something.

02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.619
They wanna blow those
water tanks above you.

02:17:52.826 --> 02:17:54.454
They think it'll kill the fire.

02:18:02.003 --> 02:18:04.172
How are they gonna get the
explosives up here?

02:18:06.090 --> 02:18:09.177
They'll find some dumb
son of a bitch to bring it up.

02:18:16.936 --> 02:18:18.938
Hang on, I'll tell them.

02:18:23.609 --> 02:18:27.362
They want to put out the fire by
blowing the water tanks above us.

02:18:27.737 --> 02:18:32.075
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete,
but if they don't try it, we'll burn.

02:18:32.284 --> 02:18:34.077
The fire's out of control.

02:18:34.662 --> 02:18:37.289
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.

02:18:37.957 --> 02:18:41.627
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.

02:18:48.717 --> 02:18:51.094
Come on. Let's go.

02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:56.058
Get that line.

02:19:05.276 --> 02:19:06.485
Get off!

02:19:06.693 --> 02:19:09.947
- You crazy bastards! Drop this line!
- Let go of me!

02:19:10.197 --> 02:19:12.449
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.

02:19:14.075 --> 02:19:16.287
It won't hold everybody!

02:19:17.413 --> 02:19:18.789
Get off!

02:19:19.915 --> 02:19:21.125
Get off!

02:19:22.501 --> 02:19:24.044
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!

02:19:32.387 --> 02:19:33.805
Get off.

02:19:44.733 --> 02:19:45.775
Chief.

02:19:50.196 --> 02:19:53.200
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.

02:19:53.408 --> 02:19:54.659
It's under control now.

02:19:56.411 --> 02:20:00.290
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.

02:20:01.917 --> 02:20:04.794
I know where to place the charges,
but I don't know how.

02:20:05.712 --> 02:20:07.172
I know how.

02:20:11.593 --> 02:20:13.220
See you up there.

02:20:20.727 --> 02:20:24.814
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...

02:20:25.065 --> 02:20:26.816
...anything you can find!

02:20:27.067 --> 02:20:28.443
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.

02:20:28.693 --> 02:20:30.320
Get some knives.

02:20:33.907 --> 02:20:34.950
There we go.

02:20:37.745 --> 02:20:41.415
For God's sakes, Carlos. Don't tie
yourself up to a lot of glass.

02:20:41.666 --> 02:20:43.084
That's the '29.

02:21:26.669 --> 02:21:27.879
Try it.

02:21:30.047 --> 02:21:31.424
It's okay.

02:21:37.221 --> 02:21:38.306
Doug...

02:21:39.807 --> 02:21:42.310
...I never thought this could happen.

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.728
Sure.

02:24:14.131 --> 02:24:17.760
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.

02:24:18.636 --> 02:24:22.139
We'll have to blow the floors
as well as the tanks, you know.

02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:24.725
All right. This is your detonator.

02:24:24.975 --> 02:24:28.729
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed. Here you go.

02:24:28.979 --> 02:24:31.440
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.

02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:33.609
Later on,
after you throw the wire...

02:24:33.859 --> 02:24:38.489
...we'll plug it and splice it into
the timer, set it, and it blows.

02:24:41.158 --> 02:24:44.787
Set your explosive like this.

02:24:49.291 --> 02:24:52.836
Take your detonator,
pull the plug.

02:24:54.213 --> 02:24:55.589
Toss it.

02:24:59.552 --> 02:25:02.054
- Got it?
- I got it.

02:26:15.962 --> 02:26:18.798
- Good luck. See you later.
- Okay, thanks.

02:27:01.634 --> 02:27:03.010
Here you go.

02:27:23.698 --> 02:27:25.241
What will you set it for?

02:27:26.033 --> 02:27:27.410
Five.

02:27:29.787 --> 02:27:31.789
I think we can make that.

02:27:36.002 --> 02:27:37.044
That's it.

02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:14.291
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!

02:28:29.806 --> 02:28:33.310
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?

02:28:33.518 --> 02:28:34.978
Three and a half.

02:28:35.812 --> 02:28:36.855
Here.

02:28:38.899 --> 02:28:39.942
Here.

02:29:20.358 --> 02:29:21.901
I'm burning up!

02:29:30.952 --> 02:29:32.328
Let's go!

02:29:39.127 --> 02:29:40.461
Fireman?

02:33:22.144 --> 02:33:23.396
Bob!

02:33:23.646 --> 02:33:24.855
Bob!

02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:20.136
Excuse me.

02:37:20.595 --> 02:37:24.516
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady. Mrs. Mueller.

02:37:24.766 --> 02:37:26.226
Have you seen her?

02:37:28.395 --> 02:37:30.981
I'm sorry, she's dead.

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:41.992
Lisa!

02:37:42.909 --> 02:37:44.077
Lisa!

02:37:46.621 --> 02:37:48.874
- Claiborne!
- What?

02:38:40.676 --> 02:38:43.095
I didn't want you to see him.

02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:50.686
You know, there's nothing any of us
can do to bring back the dead.

02:38:59.862 --> 02:39:03.115
All I can do now is pray to God...

02:39:04.659 --> 02:39:07.912
...that I can stop this from
ever happening again.

02:39:47.077 --> 02:39:48.579
I don't know.

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.915
Maybe they just ought to leave it
the way it is.

02:39:52.165 --> 02:39:55.878
Kind of a shrine to all
the bullshit in the world.

02:40:04.803 --> 02:40:08.974
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.

02:40:09.725 --> 02:40:14.479
One of these days, they'll kill
10,000 in one of these firetraps.

02:40:15.355 --> 02:40:18.233
And I'll keep eating smoke
and bringing out bodies...

02:40:18.817 --> 02:40:21.194
...until somebody asks us...

02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:23.780
...how to build them.

02:40:35.334 --> 02:40:38.754
Okay. I'm asking.

02:40:40.297 --> 02:40:42.175
You know where to reach me.

02:40:43.635 --> 02:40:45.303
So long, architect.
