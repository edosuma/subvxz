00:01.435 --> 00:03.537
Previously on Outsiders...
GUARD: Anybody wants to go past

00:03.571 --> 00:06.040
this point here, I got to clear
it with Mr. Meyers' office.

00:06.074 --> 00:07.275
MEYERS: As far as the Farrells,
things will be

00:07.308 --> 00:09.543
a little different
on that front from now on.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.245
HOUGHTON: With things amping up,
I can't protect you.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
So I think it'd be better
if you just disappear.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
Okay.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.252
SALLY-ANN:
What are you looking at?

00:18.286 --> 00:20.154
HASIL: Looks like I got
me a fight club fan.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.090
Wade? Wade Houghton?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.425
Dana Miller.
We should get drinks sometime.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.127
LEDDA:
I was visited, Wade.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.728
I think it was Breece.

00:27.761 --> 00:28.662
He doesn't want me to be scared.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.131
What's the matter?

00:30.164 --> 00:31.465
The hospital called.

00:31.499 --> 00:32.600
I'm in remission.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.069
You should take a rest.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.637
Doesn't help anyone,

00:36.670 --> 00:37.771
especially not the baby.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.109
(helicopter whirring)

00:41.142 --> 00:43.444
G'WIN: The coal company
poisoned our fields.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.318
Sweet Allis Spring, too.
The time for peace is over.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.220
So I think we get
one of them up here.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.321
Make them face us.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.590
Hasil?

00:56.624 --> 00:58.626
Uh, sorry.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.761
G'WIN: We got that coal boss
coming up here.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.364
And her fate
will be tied to ours.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.598
She will sit at our table

01:04.632 --> 01:06.734
and she will drink our water.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.437
-(grunting)
-Put me down!

01:09.470 --> 01:12.606
Let me down now!

01:13.641 --> 01:15.576
(panting)

01:23.551 --> 01:25.186
Ow!

01:28.789 --> 01:30.090
(sniffles)

01:37.565 --> 01:39.367
BIG FOSTER:
Ain't no time to rest.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.202
-On your feet.
-Can't.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.839
-Come on.
-I said I can't...

01:47.708 --> 01:48.742
Ow...

02:02.623 --> 02:04.158
Aah...

02:05.393 --> 02:07.328
(screaming)

02:16.270 --> 02:19.407
Folks don't know these woods
tend to lose their way.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.777
You need help? Huh?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
(grunts)

02:26.880 --> 02:28.882
(choking)

02:31.252 --> 02:33.153
(Haylie crying)

02:35.356 --> 02:38.959
(country blues music)

02:38.992 --> 02:42.663
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

02:42.696 --> 02:47.301
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:47.335 --> 02:50.271
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

02:50.304 --> 02:52.606
* And they'll go running back

02:52.640 --> 02:58.846
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:58.879 --> 03:04.285
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

03:04.318 --> 03:06.954
* And the land

03:06.987 --> 03:10.758
* Will suffer those who came.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.437
BARBARA:
Are you sure?

03:23.471 --> 03:24.838
I kind of liked it.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.974
LIL FOSTER:
It's old.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.644
(speaking native language)

03:30.678 --> 03:32.913
(scoffs)

03:58.972 --> 04:00.441
HOUGHTON: I mean, what
am I supposed to be looking at?

04:00.474 --> 04:03.844
DR. SCHREIER:
That dark shadow.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.579
Well which one is a month ago?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.381
DR. SCHREIER:
The one on the left.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.882
HOUGHTON: How'd it go
from that big to nothing?

04:08.916 --> 04:12.353
Well, it went from four
centimeters to less than two,

04:12.386 --> 04:14.522
which is not quite nothing.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.491
But Ledda's officially
in remission.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.727
Yeah, so, she didn't
have any chemotherapy.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.061
She didn't have radiation,
n-nothing.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.896
I mean,
she didn't have anything.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.565
What happened?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.668
Wade, will you stop
looking for bad news?

04:27.701 --> 04:31.839
I told you,
God has a plan for me.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.311
Thank you.
Y-You have a good day too. Bye.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.779
(Hasil grunts)

04:40.781 --> 04:42.450
I have a job interview.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.618
-Don't say?
-(giggles)

04:44.652 --> 04:46.687
Ain't that fine?
(chuckles)

04:48.789 --> 04:51.659
-Do you know what that is?
-Well, I heard the word "job,"

04:51.692 --> 04:54.762
and I seen you smiling, so I
figured it must be a good thing.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.897
Well, I don't have the job yet,

04:56.930 --> 04:59.400
but they're thinking
of hiring me.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.437
So, just need to meet the boss
first, and if he likes me...

05:03.471 --> 05:07.408
That boss,
he's gonna see you like I do.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.042
He's gonna love you.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.481
(exhales)

05:13.514 --> 05:14.815
(grunts)

05:14.848 --> 05:16.083
-Dang it.
-You okay?

05:16.116 --> 05:18.085
Yeah, I'm just a bit disturbed

05:18.118 --> 05:19.487
from the last fight.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.955
Come on. Come on.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.826
(moans)

05:25.859 --> 05:29.363
(inhales, exhales)

05:29.397 --> 05:31.031
Whoa, that's nice.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.733
You should stop fighting.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.835
Oh, come on.
I'm fit as a fiddle.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.070
What if that sheriff finds you?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.072
Look, the sheriff, he's not
coming for me. All right?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.908
All I'm saying
is how do you know?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.711
He told you he didn't want
to see you down here again.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.746
Could be at every fight club,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.715
just waiting to catch you.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.785
If I stop,
how are we gonna make do?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.487
I got this job interview.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.822
I've applied all over the place,

05:54.855 --> 05:56.724
I'll get a second job,
if we need it.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.692
(sighs)

06:01.094 --> 06:02.863
We'll be okay.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.532
Okay?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.648
(people muttering)

06:26.554 --> 06:28.388
Ah!

06:40.934 --> 06:44.505
My name is G'Winveer Farrell,
and I'm Bren'in to this clan.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.974
You must be thirsty.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.980
This water,
it comes fresh from our spring.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.855
Why am I here?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.191
Because you lead
that coal company.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.993
(laughs)
No, no, no.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.861
There's been a big
misunderstanding.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.563
I don't lead One Planet.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.898
Um...

07:12.700 --> 07:14.067
Hello, everybody.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.235
Hi.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.837
My name is Haylie Grimes,

07:16.870 --> 07:19.072
and I'm the head
of community relations.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.908
Hi.
(chuckles)

07:23.076 --> 07:24.612
It's so nice to meet y'all.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.046
(clears throat)

07:28.181 --> 07:30.050
Uh...

07:30.083 --> 07:34.588
Just outside of Blackburg, we've
built these wonderful condos,

07:34.622 --> 07:37.157
these living spaces
just for you.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.660
They're, um,
one to three bedrooms.

07:39.693 --> 07:43.531
They have all new appliances,
that can, can cook,

07:43.564 --> 07:44.998
and keep food cold.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.606
Uh, my job is to help y'all.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.776
Uh...

08:05.786 --> 08:07.588
Wait.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.889
You promised
she'd drink the water.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.190
(excited chatter)

08:10.223 --> 08:11.825
If she knew about the water,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.994
she would not have raised
the jar to her lips.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.130
No matter. She's with
the coal company, she drinks.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.832
(excited chatter)

08:18.866 --> 08:20.067
Quiet!

08:21.902 --> 08:24.538
That would make us no better
than those who harmed us.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.712
What's with your water?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.915
Come with me.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.786
CROWD:
Yeah!

08:38.819 --> 08:41.154
WOMAN:
Get out of here.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.123
*

08:54.768 --> 08:56.704

09:18.058 --> 09:19.993

10:01.935 --> 10:03.937
Our school.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.739
What language is that?

10:05.773 --> 10:08.676
G'WIN:
We call it Old Tongue.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.877
TEACHER:

10:09.910 --> 10:11.344
CHILDREN:
Hool.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.982
Could I have my phone?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.884
There's no way
it's gonna work up here.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.618
I just would like
to take a picture.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.924
-Tiha.
-CHILDREN: Tiha.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.325

-CHILDREN: Lunn.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.307
G'WIN:
Hmm.

10:42.843 --> 10:47.047
Your village is really
very impressive, G'Winveer.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.718
You know, I never thought

10:50.751 --> 10:54.822
it would be
so planned and organized.

10:54.855 --> 10:59.693
All the craftsmanship
was really very...

10:59.727 --> 11:01.695
(coughs)

11:01.729 --> 11:04.231
Ugh...

11:04.264 --> 11:06.199
(coughing continues)

11:11.772 --> 11:13.440
This was our best spring.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.343
Poisoned.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.814
I showed you mercy
not having you drink that water.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.483
Mercy not shown to us.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.485
Who did this?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.320
You did.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.156
Your coal company.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.032
W... Wait a minute,
what am I doing?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.902
-How do you punch?
-Press X, man.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.937
Well, I'm doing it,
but it's not letting me hit you.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.039
-Why can't I hit you?
-That's 'cause I'm hitting you.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.276
Well, would you stop for a spell
and let me hit you?

11:49.309 --> 11:51.111
Check it out.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.880
(video game characters grunting)

11:52.913 --> 11:56.383
(roars, yells)

11:56.416 --> 11:58.151
Did you just tear my leg off?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.787
Ha-ha-ha! Fatality.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.154
Mortal Kombat!

12:02.255 --> 12:04.091
You want to play again?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.259
-No.
-All right.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.199
So, Butch, I need to...

12:12.232 --> 12:14.067
I need to talk to you.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.402
Damn.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.804
Sounds serious.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.372
Yeah. Look, it, uh...

12:19.406 --> 12:23.443
this ain't an easy decision, but
I can't do fight club anymore.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.445
What the hell are you talking
about, man? Fight's tonight!

12:25.478 --> 12:28.015
-I know. -And you can't back out
at the last minute.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.283
Think of all the money we're
gonna... you're gonna make.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.219
Look, if I get caught,
it doesn't matter

12:32.252 --> 12:34.054
how much paper I got.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.322
Ain't that some shit.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.457
I open my house to you,

12:37.490 --> 12:39.860
let you crash on my couch,

12:39.893 --> 12:41.995
let you eat my food,
and you smoke my weed

12:42.029 --> 12:44.131
if you wanted to--
you didn't; that's your loss.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.933
And this is
your "Thanks, Butch"?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.101
-It's my sorry to you, Butch.
-You already gave me

12:48.135 --> 12:49.202
your sorry once, remember?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.971
Now what are you gonna give me,

12:51.004 --> 12:52.472
a wood-carved jackass
or something?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.041
-Oh, that's funny.
-I mean, seriously,

12:54.074 --> 12:56.076
how are you gonna support
Sally-Ann and that baby?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.078
Look, man,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.080
if you're worried about
the po-po, I'll take care of it.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.915
I'll keep an eye out--
first sign of 'em,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.316
I'll give you the signal:
whoop-whoop!

13:03.350 --> 13:05.218
We'll get you out of there
in a flash.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.454
This ain't gonna work.
See, it's too risky.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.023
-Sally-Ann ain't gonna go
for that. -(sighs)

13:10.057 --> 13:14.127
You just need to finish up
a few more fights, jail-free,

13:14.161 --> 13:16.196
and once you're bringing home
wads and wads of paper

13:16.229 --> 13:18.398
for that sweet little baby,
Sally-Ann will see

13:18.431 --> 13:20.868
that it's all good,
and then she'll say,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.803
(high-pitched):
"Oh, Hasil, I love you so much."

13:25.272 --> 13:28.008
She ain't never said that
to me before.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.077
She will now.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.511
I promise, my dude.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.015
Come on. Let's play another one.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.218
MARYBETH:
Oh.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.553
Oh, Sheriff, thank God.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.189
-You her secretary?
-Yes.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.124
-This her car?
-Yes.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.859
She didn't show up
for her conference call today,

13:45.893 --> 13:47.127
and she never misses a call.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.896
Her phone keeps going
to voice mail.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.363
I came here to find her,

13:50.397 --> 13:52.332
and I found this.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.338
(Marybeth groans)

14:02.175 --> 14:04.577
-(Marybeth sighs)
-You the night manager?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.079
Yeah.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.381
-You see her return last night?
-Nah.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.582
Few days ago.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.319
Uh-huh.
She go straight to her room?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.087
Went to the bar, I think.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.323
Hmm. Bartender in yet?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.557
MAN:
Didn't see her last night,

14:17.590 --> 14:19.592
but she was here
every other night.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.294
Always one glass of Merlot.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.297
Nice-looking chick, but tough,
with a capital "T."

14:24.331 --> 14:26.333
-How's that?
-I tried chatting her up,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.001
but she was having none of it,

14:28.035 --> 14:29.336
always scrolling on her phone.
High-strung.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.338
-Know what I mean?
-Okay, let's...

14:31.371 --> 14:34.007
-Oh, and a bad tipper. Always
only leaves change. -Listen,

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
I'm gonna need you
to focus, okay?

14:35.408 --> 14:38.045
-She ever drink here
with anyone else? -(sighs)

14:38.078 --> 14:40.147
Only other night was
two nights ago.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.681
She was talking to some dude.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.083
Hipster beard.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.384
-Really?
-You know,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.053
the hippy-dippy type,
tree hugger.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.088
Hey, listen, you think
you could describe this guy?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.257
I mean, could you describe him
to a sketch artist?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.292
Yeah, no problem, Sheriff.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
HAYLIE: Six years ago,
this town in West Virginia

14:54.561 --> 14:56.196
sued One Planet.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.697
Their water was tainted,
and they thought

14:57.730 --> 15:00.167
it was because we were dumping
coal waste into it.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.403
But it turned out
it was cyanobacteria from algae.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.938
You think...

15:04.972 --> 15:07.240
that this spring was poisoned
by nature?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.509
I'm just saying
it doesn't prove anything.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.144
You know,
before your company came,

15:11.178 --> 15:12.545
it was always clean.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.049
Did you see anyone poison it?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.551
We did not do it ourselves.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.287
Come on, keep up.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.521
Come on.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.127
Was this done by nature?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.563
I'm sure there's an explanation.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.632
We have chemists.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.001
They can look into it.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.468
(chuckles)

15:35.502 --> 15:38.238
Your plane draped all our fields
in some kind of poison.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.973
These were
our most fertile plots

15:40.007 --> 15:41.241
on this mountain-- now look.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.076
Nothing grows here.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.278
Those planes,
did they have any markings

15:45.312 --> 15:46.679
or anything on them?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.581
The powder burned my eyes.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.583
I'm just now seeing clear again.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.321
So can we agree they could have
come from anyone, anywhere?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.688
Who else besides
your company wants us

15:55.722 --> 15:57.224
off this mountain
with such fury?

15:57.257 --> 16:00.527
One Planet would not starve you
from your home.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.162
That's not possible.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.297
Oh, you're not just starving us.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.266
You're killing us.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.637
Bring her.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.141
(chanting in native language)

16:16.643 --> 16:20.047
(Emelye continues chanting)

16:22.349 --> 16:25.052
A grieving circle.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.287
Who died?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.056
Silas Shay.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.691
Only eight winters old.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.693
(bird cawing in distance)

16:38.131 --> 16:41.234
(birds chirping)

16:47.307 --> 16:50.210
That's one of the coal devils--
she needs to drink

16:50.243 --> 16:52.579
-the water that killed Silas!
-No, Eela, she needs to see

16:52.612 --> 16:54.214
the grief
her company has caused.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.283
EELA:
Who are you to take my boy?

16:56.316 --> 16:59.152
He never had an unkind thought,
never hurt a soul.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.453
I hear you.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.521
Eela!

17:01.554 --> 17:03.423
(crying)

17:03.456 --> 17:05.225
Oh, it's okay.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.694
G'Winveer...

17:07.727 --> 17:09.829
I promise you,
as soon as I'm back down,

17:09.862 --> 17:11.698
I'm gonna do
everything in my power...

17:11.731 --> 17:13.166
Take her.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.138
(sobbing)

17:18.171 --> 17:20.140
HAYLIE:
Ow! Let me go!

17:20.173 --> 17:21.441
Let go of me!

17:21.474 --> 17:22.709
Oh, wait, hold on.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.178
No, no, no! Come on!

17:25.212 --> 17:26.379
I don't want... No!

17:26.413 --> 17:27.780
-Get in there!
-No! No!

17:27.814 --> 17:29.516
(Haylie sobbing)

17:29.549 --> 17:30.683
No!

17:33.820 --> 17:36.223
G'Winveer, wait.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.357
Wait.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.226
What do you want from me?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261
Please, what can I do?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.296
G'Winveer, come back!

17:43.330 --> 17:45.332
-(door thumping)
-G'Winveer!

18:06.753 --> 18:09.389
You can't hide this child
no more.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.293
(Big Foster exhales)

18:15.162 --> 18:17.430
Unless there's
some kind of miracle...

18:17.464 --> 18:19.899
it can't be mine.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.868
Is it Asa's?

18:23.270 --> 18:24.871
Lil Foster's?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.408
Somebody else's?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.744
It ain't Asa's.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.247
And there weren't nobody else.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.415
So it's my boy's.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.318
This is my child, Foster. Mine.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.722
It is my responsibility,
mine alone.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.193
And I am gonna carry it careful,

18:46.226 --> 18:49.262
bring it into this world
healthy and strong.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.831
I already lost one child;
I'm not gonna lose another.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.601
No, I know. I know.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.570
Whether you like it or not,
we are married.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.441
And I will be
this child's father.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.512
You really believe that?

19:05.545 --> 19:09.516
You really think you have
a right or claim on this child?

19:09.549 --> 19:13.786
(sighs) Look, I know,
I know there ain't nothin'...

19:13.820 --> 19:16.956
that I can say to you
that's gonna make you believe

19:16.989 --> 19:19.792
that I can raise this child up
right with you.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.861
So I'm gonna have to show you.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.630
And I will.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.266
You want to show me
you can be a Fa,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.568
then be one to your son.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.578
Hasil, you here?

19:41.414 --> 19:42.615
Hasil?

19:51.791 --> 19:53.626
"Me and Hasil went out.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.863
Won't be late. I think. Butch."

19:56.896 --> 19:58.531
Hmm.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.876
Hey, Frida.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.879
(crowd shouting,
loud music playing)

20:12.912 --> 20:14.947
MAN:
Step back, little boy.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.583
(man grunts)

20:26.759 --> 20:29.596
Hey. Hey. H-How, uh...

20:29.629 --> 20:31.864
how was your job interview?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.266
Not good, Hasil.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.268
And then I find out about this?

20:35.302 --> 20:36.736
-Why'd you lie to me?
-Sally-Ann,

20:36.769 --> 20:38.338
I can't let you burden yourself

20:38.371 --> 20:40.307
being the only one
putting paper down for us.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.710
Look, every Farrell man
does his part raising his child.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.478
Let me do mine.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.581
Now, if there's something else
that I can do down here,

20:48.615 --> 20:50.717
I would, but for now,
this is it.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.789
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.359
-Then we do this my way?
-Yeah.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.694
-Keep you from getting caught.
-Yeah, all right.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
-Okay. -All right,
look, look, if you guys

21:03.696 --> 21:05.064
are worried about the po-po,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.733
I'm clocking that door
all night, okay?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.668
And what about all the doors
I saw coming in?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.303
You know people here--
get some of them

21:10.337 --> 21:11.504
to watch every one of them.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.972
We're gonna have to pay 'em.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.541
You're gonna have to 'em,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.409
'cause it's coming
out of your cut.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.479
-That's just crazy talk. I'm...
-And no selling pot.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.650
N-No, no, no way, no how
I'm letting this happen, okay?

21:23.683 --> 21:24.817
Okay.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.553
Let's go.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.688
Let's go. Come on, we're going.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.724
Wait, wait, wait,
h-hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.494
Please. I promise
I won't sell anything,

21:34.527 --> 21:36.896
but you got to pay
for half the look-outs.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.466
Now, that's fair.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.934
Come on, we got a deal?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.575
Well, all right.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.914
Now go win.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.483
Okay?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.853
* I believe

22:00.887 --> 22:02.422
* That you...

22:05.392 --> 22:07.760
What color wine you want,
yellow or red?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.729
Oh, I boycott wine.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.098
-Oh. -I am against
the systemic slaughter of grapes

22:12.131 --> 22:13.800
in the winemaking process.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.869
Oh, shit.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.671
How you feel about killing hops?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.106
Oh, not a problem.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.375
Ain't nothing wrong
with barley, neither.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.144
You got one of those concoctions
lying around?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.380
I think
I can rustle one up, yeah.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.481
Perfect.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.818
Thank you.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.453
Oh.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.389
* Like it should be...

22:36.423 --> 22:38.057
(sighs)
Cheers.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.026
(chuckles):
Oh. Cheers.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.698
(exhales)

22:46.833 --> 22:49.569
*

22:49.602 --> 22:51.538
Thought you weren't a drinker.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.974
Um... yeah.. It just feels
like a nice idea.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.577
Hmm.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.046
What am I doing?

23:00.079 --> 23:02.081
What the hell am I doing here?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.050
What am I up to?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.753
Uh... one, two.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.722
-I like your house.
-Thanks.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.090
You lived here
with your parents, right?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.159
HOUGHTON: Uh, yeah.
I lived here

23:13.192 --> 23:14.794
pretty much my whole life.

23:14.827 --> 23:18.731
Um, you know, my mom left it
to me and Andi-Rae.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.838
Well, it really is great
about Ledda, huh?

23:25.872 --> 23:27.574
I mean, I do not use
the word "miracle,"

23:27.607 --> 23:30.643
but, honestly,
this sure feels like one.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.778
Yeah.

23:33.813 --> 23:37.149
I don't know about a miracle,
but, uh,

23:37.183 --> 23:39.519
it's not too shabby.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.528
It'll be a miracle if this
thing's gonna be edible.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.997
-(laughs)
-This has gone solid as a rock,

23:51.030 --> 23:53.132
-and that's burning.
-Oh, uh, I-I'm sure it'll be...

23:53.165 --> 23:56.135
-I'm sure it-- um...
-(Houghton laughs)

23:56.168 --> 23:58.471
* When the sun goes down

23:58.505 --> 24:00.773
* On my side of town

24:00.807 --> 24:02.975
* That lonesome feeling

24:03.009 --> 24:05.812
* Comes to my door...

24:05.845 --> 24:08.848
Where's your bedroom?

24:08.881 --> 24:10.116
Down the hall.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.585
Well, I'd sure love to see it.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.656
-Okay.
-* Run-down bar

24:16.689 --> 24:19.659
* Across the railroad tracks

24:19.692 --> 24:21.928
* I got a table for two

24:21.961 --> 24:23.796
* Way in the back...

24:27.534 --> 24:30.937
Well, yeah.
This is it.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.707
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.042
I'll be right back.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.477
Okay.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.917
* Now if you lose

24:44.951 --> 24:47.554
-Oh.
-* Your one and only

24:47.587 --> 24:49.221
* There's always room here

24:49.255 --> 24:52.224
-(sighs)
-* For the lonely

24:52.258 --> 24:54.060
* To watch your broken dreams

24:54.093 --> 24:55.895
* Dance in and out
of the beams *

24:55.928 --> 24:59.899
-Okay... yeah.
-* Of a neon moon.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.801
(door opens)

25:01.834 --> 25:03.135
Oh.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.039
Too many clothes.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.875
Um...

25:08.908 --> 25:10.677
Yeah. Hey, it's uh...

25:10.710 --> 25:12.812
you know, it's, uh,
it's getting kind of late.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.648
-Mmm. Something wrong?
-Oh. Uh...

25:15.682 --> 25:18.017
No. No, I was just, uh...

25:18.050 --> 25:19.719
Yeah. I was just thinking

25:19.752 --> 25:20.920
that, uh, you know, um...

25:20.953 --> 25:22.822
I really-- like, I...

25:22.855 --> 25:25.024
I, uh, you know, we got this,
um, missing person case

25:25.057 --> 25:26.993
-going on at the moment,
and, uh... -Mmm.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.761
You know, I have to get up
really early.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.162
And, uh, you know, uh...

25:30.196 --> 25:32.231
-Wade.
-Yeah?

25:32.264 --> 25:35.768
I'm not getting off this bed
until you have sex with me.

25:35.802 --> 25:39.338
Oh. Okay.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.741
(crickets chirping)

25:46.312 --> 25:48.247
(animals howling in distance)

26:00.192 --> 26:01.961
(crowd cheering)

26:01.994 --> 26:03.930
(bell rings)

26:05.632 --> 26:07.566
-Go, Hasil!
-(grunting)

26:13.740 --> 26:15.241
Come on.

26:28.688 --> 26:31.791
-No, baby, no! -BUTCH: Come on,
man. That was a cheap shot.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.830
-Hasil, stop the fight.
-I can't.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.198
Look, man, you got to get back
in there, or that's it.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.133
-We're done.
-Okay.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.802
-What?
-I love you,

26:42.835 --> 26:44.403
Hasil Farrell, okay?

26:44.436 --> 26:48.340
I love you. Okay?

26:48.374 --> 26:49.408
(crowd cheering)

26:49.441 --> 26:52.078
(crowd claps rhythmically)

26:56.215 --> 26:57.984
(cheering)

27:11.030 --> 27:12.699
(squeals)

27:14.166 --> 27:17.003
-Come on, baby.
-(grunting)

27:29.849 --> 27:30.983
-Come on, Hasil.
-Yeah.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.169
(crowd cheering wildly)

27:53.072 --> 27:55.274
-(bell clangs)
-It's over! It's over!

27:55.307 --> 27:57.176
(cheering and whooping)

28:02.081 --> 28:04.016
*

28:09.355 --> 28:11.023
(Sally-Ann giggles)

28:11.057 --> 28:14.193
How come you never
said that before?

28:14.226 --> 28:16.362
Really?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.064
I love you.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.108
-*
-(crowd cheering)

28:35.314 --> 28:37.149
LIL FOSTER:
The story has it,

28:37.183 --> 28:39.385
when the first Farrells,
Shays and McGintuks,

28:39.418 --> 28:41.754
when they were looking
for a place to settle,

28:41.788 --> 28:43.823
they came to this spot,
right here.

28:43.856 --> 28:48.027
And they decided it would their
new Airnaugh.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.797
Home?

28:50.830 --> 28:53.833
Or heaven, yeah.

28:53.866 --> 28:57.169
Look, right there,
build a house, right?

28:57.203 --> 28:58.537
Dig a well.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.408
Hunt, fish.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.912
I want to spend the rest
of my days up here.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.746
Alone or otherwise.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.789
BARBARA (laughing): What's the
clan gonna think of this?

29:16.823 --> 29:18.190
They can think what they like.

29:18.224 --> 29:22.261
I ain't got a place
in that family no more.

29:22.294 --> 29:26.465
You want to start a new one,
then?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.968
Let me bear another one
of your children.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.972
What are you talking about?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.273
Another?

29:34.306 --> 29:37.109
Uh, I thought you knew.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.945
Knew what?

29:41.580 --> 29:45.952
-Knew what?
-G'Win.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.199
Hey.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.400
Hi.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.970
Hey, hi, there.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.138
Hey, what are y'alls names?

30:06.172 --> 30:08.574
My name's Haylie.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.981
You like this?

30:15.014 --> 30:18.017
You like that?
That's called a watch.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.452
I tell you what.

30:20.486 --> 30:24.090
I will trade you my watch

30:24.123 --> 30:26.092
for those berries.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.494
Huh?

30:32.631 --> 30:34.566
(children giggling)

30:40.139 --> 30:42.441
Mmm.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.112
(indistinct speaking nearby)

30:48.480 --> 30:50.182
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.450
(Ledda chuckles)

30:51.483 --> 30:53.886
Did you meet that woman
last night?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.322
(chuckling): Did I meet
that woman last night?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.656
Why are you asking me that?

30:57.689 --> 30:58.958
'Cause you're smiling.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.027
Well, uh, maybe I'm smiling

31:01.060 --> 31:02.494
'cause your mom's
feeling better,

31:02.528 --> 31:04.163
-did you think about that?
-LEDDA: All right, go.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.099
Get your bags, five minutes,
meet me at the car.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.068
Hup!

31:12.271 --> 31:14.473
Didn't hear you come in
till morning. How'd it go?

31:14.506 --> 31:17.309
Um, yeah.
It was fine.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.112
-It was fine?
-Yeah, it was fine.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.081
(children laughing in distance)

31:24.516 --> 31:26.685
Hey, uh, listen, I've been
meaning to ask you.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.354
You know anything about that guy
who threw coal dust

31:28.387 --> 31:29.588
on Haylie Grimes?

31:29.621 --> 31:33.492
Hmm. Why would I?

31:33.525 --> 31:37.029
Well, 'cause he's a part
of your protest.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.232
What's this about?

31:40.266 --> 31:42.034
Haylie Grimes has gone missing.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.437
It looks suspicious.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.973
We think she might
have been kidnapped.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.448
Recognize this fella?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.265
Sheriff's department.
Open up.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.600
(door opening)

32:18.070 --> 32:19.371
Gordon Jerrod?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.207
Uh, yeah. Can I help you?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.541
JERROD: I don't know where she
could have gone.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.743
Yeah. How do you know her?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.046
I went to her office to
apologize for the coal dust.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.015
You see her any other time?

32:29.048 --> 32:30.516
I mean, I met her
at her hotel's bar.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.118
Oh.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.386
And spent the night,
but just the one night.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.288
-I haven't seen her since.
-Did she mention

32:36.322 --> 32:38.457
anything about taking a trip,
going on a holiday?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.192
Not to me. I mean,
she said her company

32:40.226 --> 32:42.028
moves her around a lot, though.
Did you check with them?

32:42.061 --> 32:43.429
Yeah. Only, you know,

32:43.462 --> 32:45.197
they wouldn't have left her bag
in her car,

32:45.231 --> 32:48.000
with the door open and her shoes
lying in the parking lot.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.336
I mean, if anyone

32:50.369 --> 32:52.638
had a reason to grab her
it's gonna be a shit like you.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.306
I didn't kidnap her.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.008
Look, I was with a friend
last night.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.509
I met her coming outside
of Tiny's.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.744
She was with her friends,
they're witnesses.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.112
-Call them.
-Okay.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.247
What's your friend's name?

33:01.280 --> 33:02.348
Chrissey Kormos.

33:04.116 --> 33:06.518
Chris Kormos, like the waitress
from Silviano's?

33:06.552 --> 33:09.421
Yeah.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.191
Man.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.660
You're working your way through
all the women in the county.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.763
Now, you want to be pretty
careful with that.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.565
There's a lot of vulnerable
people around.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.333
You know, you don't want to go
using them up,

33:21.367 --> 33:24.036
and then tossing them away
like a dirty old towel.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.407
Widows and such.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.442
I'll give Chrissey a call.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.280
Hey, uh...

33:34.313 --> 33:35.714
You didn't, uh...

33:35.747 --> 33:37.349
I mean, you don't know
a woman by the name

33:37.383 --> 33:38.617
of Dana Miller, do you?

33:38.650 --> 33:40.352
No.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.488
Oh, good.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.556
Did he do it?

33:44.590 --> 33:46.758
Sheriff, I'm just concerned
about Haylie.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.227
Please, don't make me beg.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.661
Oh. I'd like to see that.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.263
No. I think he's got
a pretty good alibi.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.798
He just met up with Haylie
a couple of times.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.067
-Couple of times where?
-Like, uh, at her office,

33:55.101 --> 33:57.803
-uh, bar.
-Her office? Really?

34:03.475 --> 34:05.411
(animal howling in distance)

34:10.449 --> 34:13.719
-(people clamoring in distance)
-(owl hoots)

34:21.627 --> 34:24.663
(indistinct chatter)

34:24.696 --> 34:27.799
SHURN:
Eela, come forward.

34:27.833 --> 34:31.337
Eela, I'm so, so sorry
about your son.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.772
-I have a little boy
about that same age. -Hold her!

34:33.805 --> 34:34.706
(gasps)

34:34.740 --> 34:36.342
-No! No!
-Get her!

34:36.375 --> 34:38.477
No! No! Get away from me.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.678
Get away! Get away!

34:39.711 --> 34:41.447
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

34:41.480 --> 34:42.781
(yelling)

34:42.814 --> 34:44.216
-(others shouting)
-No! Stay away from me!

34:44.250 --> 34:45.517
Stay away! Aah!

34:45.551 --> 34:48.354
(Haylie sobbing)

34:51.590 --> 34:52.658
Open her mouth!

34:52.691 --> 34:54.260
(screams)

34:54.293 --> 34:55.561
Pour!

34:55.594 --> 34:58.364
(others continue shouting)

35:00.332 --> 35:02.668
-Hold her mouth open!
-MAN: Yeah-heh-heh!

35:02.701 --> 35:04.436
(screaming)

35:11.210 --> 35:13.645
-Pour it!
-Stop!

35:13.679 --> 35:15.447
-(crowd quiets)
-Stop this!

35:15.481 --> 35:17.549
(sobbing)

35:17.583 --> 35:20.686
Eela, I feel your sorrow,

35:20.719 --> 35:23.189
but do not let your grief
fuel your rage.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.425
-EELA: She deserves to die.
-No, don't do this!

35:26.458 --> 35:27.859
Do you remember our troubles

35:27.893 --> 35:30.429
the last time an outsider
was killed up here?

35:30.462 --> 35:32.431
Do you want those troubles
to come back?

35:32.464 --> 35:35.701
Because they will--
and in greater numbers.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.903
And then
it won't just be Silas,

35:37.936 --> 35:40.506
but all our chilluns
who have to suffer.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.244
(owl hooting)

35:49.581 --> 35:51.517
(shuddering breaths)

35:57.989 --> 36:00.226
(animal chitters in distance)

36:08.867 --> 36:10.469
(frog croaking)

36:16.775 --> 36:18.510
Release her.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.314
Go on.

36:22.348 --> 36:26.452
Many sorrys
for my people's behavior.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.288
You should never have suffered
that attack; it's not our way.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.198
Farrell Wine?

36:42.368 --> 36:45.237
Our tradition has it that when
one wishes to speak to another,

36:45.271 --> 36:46.838
hash out differences...

36:46.872 --> 36:49.408
(laughs) You really think
I'm gonna drink with you?

36:58.450 --> 36:59.751
Please.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.701
Hell, that's like drinkin' silk.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.659
What is that?

37:40.692 --> 37:43.795
-Are you giving me champagne?
-We're celebrating.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.465
Couldn't do it last night--
you were... occupied.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.266
To hope.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.374
Is this sparkling cider?

37:55.407 --> 37:58.710
(chuckles)
Yeah, mine's the hard stuff.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.746
Oh, well, thank you for that,

38:00.779 --> 38:03.549
but, um, I had a beer
last night, actually.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.384
I'm fine.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.888
Listen...

38:09.921 --> 38:13.725
I'm sorry I didn't say anything
about Gordon earlier.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.594
Did he do it?

38:15.627 --> 38:18.530
No. No. No, he didn't.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.532
His alibi cleared.

38:20.566 --> 38:23.802
(sighing)

38:23.835 --> 38:25.404
Handsome fella.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.906
Yes, it was him, Wade.

38:27.939 --> 38:31.076
Well, I kind of figured as much.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.713
Think Breece would've minded?

38:34.746 --> 38:37.949
No. I think that Breece
would want me to live life

38:37.983 --> 38:39.718
and have some fun.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.720
You really think that?

38:41.753 --> 38:44.022
(chuckling):
Hell, no.

38:45.857 --> 38:49.495
(sighs)
No. I think that Breece

38:49.528 --> 38:52.130
would want me to brood
every day,

38:52.163 --> 38:56.402
and never be with another man
the rest of my life.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.604
I love him.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.572
And I miss him.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.876
But we can't...

39:04.910 --> 39:06.945
stop...

39:06.978 --> 39:10.115
Look, we got to keep going.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.584
And sometimes...

39:12.618 --> 39:14.886
you got to be
a little bit selfish.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.021
Mm.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.492
Well, I'm glad
you're sticking around.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.734
He's handsome.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.037
Yeah, he lives with his daddy.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.973
We got divorced,
and I gave him custody.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.176
They're way out in Texas.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.177
(sighs)

39:39.210 --> 39:42.448
I haven't seen Sean...

39:42.481 --> 39:44.015
(owl hooting)

39:44.049 --> 39:46.718
One Planet bounces me around
all over the place

39:46.752 --> 39:48.687
wherever the hell they need me.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.622
You let them keep you
from your home?

39:50.656 --> 39:54.059
You've never lived
off this mountain, have you?

39:54.092 --> 39:57.028
And your company's
not gonna change that.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.465
Can I just tell you...

39:59.498 --> 40:01.667
a itty-bitty little secret?

40:01.700 --> 40:04.570
You can't win.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.672
You just, you can't.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.740
They're too strong.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.009
You sorely underestimate us.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.111
They're not gonna stop.

40:13.144 --> 40:17.549
They are gonna scoop out every
scrap of coal on this mountain

40:17.583 --> 40:19.818
until all of this is flat.

40:21.553 --> 40:25.591
We've endured greater threats
than One Planet.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.694
The Farrells have been on this
mountain for over 200 years.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.563
We've outlasted
coal companies, loggers,

40:31.597 --> 40:33.699
harsh winters,
families killing families,

40:33.732 --> 40:35.200
a war 'tween the states.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.636
We are not gonna give up
this fight.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.944
*

41:04.696 --> 41:07.198
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

41:13.138 --> 41:15.774
MAN:
Steven?

41:15.807 --> 41:18.176
(chuckles)
I thought your name was Gordon.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.746
-(zapping)
-(grunting)

41:20.779 --> 41:22.180
(tires screech)

41:33.258 --> 41:35.193
*

42:00.318 --> 42:03.221
(helicopter blades whirring)

42:16.802 --> 42:19.738
(distorted, echoing howl
in distance)

42:21.072 --> 42:23.541
(distorted chittering
in distance)

42:34.119 --> 42:36.888
(distorted, cackling laughter)

42:41.827 --> 42:44.996
-(yelling)
-Everybody get inside!

42:45.030 --> 42:46.031
(helicopter blades whirring)

42:46.064 --> 42:48.800
(panicked shouts, screams)

42:48.834 --> 42:50.936
(distorted coughing)

42:50.969 --> 42:53.038
(panicked shouts)

43:09.220 --> 43:11.222
(low growling)

43:14.760 --> 43:17.362
(low growling continues)

43:21.867 --> 43:23.201
(grunts, pants)

43:23.234 --> 43:25.303
Huh? Huh?

43:27.873 --> 43:29.908
SEAN:
Mama?

43:29.941 --> 43:31.677
-Mama?
-Sean?

43:32.443 --> 43:35.180
Mama? Mama?

43:35.213 --> 43:36.414
Sean?

43:36.447 --> 43:39.718
-Mama! Mama!
-No! No!

43:39.751 --> 43:40.952
No!

43:40.986 --> 43:42.754
-(sobbing)
-Mama!

43:42.788 --> 43:43.789
(growling nearby)

43:46.257 --> 43:47.659
Mama?

43:47.693 --> 43:48.994
Sean!

43:49.027 --> 43:50.696
(muffled):
No!

43:50.729 --> 43:51.629
Sean!

43:55.200 --> 43:58.169
No...!

43:58.203 --> 44:01.172
(muffled sobbing)

44:01.206 --> 44:03.141
(sobbing echoes)

44:05.010 --> 44:06.878
(Haylie wails)

44:10.916 --> 44:12.951
No! No!

44:17.288 --> 44:19.390
(trembling breaths)

44:21.459 --> 44:22.961
(sobbing)

44:26.932 --> 44:28.834
-(gasps)
-(birds chirping)

44:28.867 --> 44:31.269
(gasping breaths)

44:31.302 --> 44:33.238
(birds singing)

44:45.416 --> 44:48.686
Miss? You all right?

45:00.165 --> 45:02.167
