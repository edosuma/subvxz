00:04.379 --> 00:06.964
Ladies, great news!

00:07.041 --> 00:09.942
You finally got rid of
the water rats in the lake?

00:09.977 --> 00:10.792
Why would I want to do that?
They eat all the garbage.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.712
The news is:

00:13.747 --> 00:15.747
My boyfriend just
asked me to marry him!

00:15.782 --> 00:17.031
You're engaged?

00:17.067 --> 00:18.325
Someone likes you?

00:18.360 --> 00:19.440
There are rats in the lake?

00:21.154 --> 00:23.363
I met him last night online,

00:23.398 --> 00:26.118
at my favorite dating site,
Desperately Seeking Anyone.

00:26.518 --> 00:27.817
And the best news is,

00:27.852 --> 00:30.095
he's a Nigerian prince!

00:30.130 --> 00:32.588
Don't be jealous!

00:32.624 --> 00:37.794
Gladys, the Nigerian prince thing
is a well-known online scam.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.689
Not true! My beloved,
Prince Mutumbo,

00:40.724 --> 00:42.749
is giving me the largest diamond

00:42.784 --> 00:45.035
from the crown jewels
for my wedding ring.

00:45.070 --> 00:46.569
Let me guess,

00:46.605 --> 00:48.747
he just needs you to send
him a few hundred dollars

00:48.783 --> 00:50.265
to help with the shipping cost?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.917
No! A few thousand.

00:54.629 --> 00:56.555
That's a lot of bubble wrap.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.415
Oh, and since I'm out of cash,

00:58.450 --> 01:01.702
I laid off the
entire kitchen staff,

01:01.737 --> 01:04.004
so your cabin has to cook
for the whole camp.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.639
Why us?

01:05.674 --> 01:08.333
Obviously, because
she trusts us Woodchucks!

01:08.368 --> 01:11.636
No, you're just the
first people I ran into.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.872
BTW, the fly swatters make
great spatulas. (CHUCKLES)

01:16.877 --> 01:17.877
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

01:17.903 --> 01:21.930

02:15.602 --> 02:19.004
Aw, look, Mrs. Kipling,

02:19.039 --> 02:21.489
my little sister got a pony
pinata for her birthday party.

02:21.525 --> 02:23.007
(GROWLS)

02:23.043 --> 02:24.818
I really miss my family.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.620
(GROWLING)

02:26.655 --> 02:28.547
I can't tell the guys
I'm homesick.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.182
They'll think I'm a baby.

02:32.511 --> 02:34.886
(BLOWING NOSE)

02:34.921 --> 02:39.974
I cannot believe you just launched
snot rocket into my T-shirt!

02:40.010 --> 02:42.050
I can't use any of mine.
They're all dirty!

02:43.464 --> 02:45.622
He's got a point.

02:45.657 --> 02:47.474
So, Jorge, you want
to go zip-lining?

02:47.509 --> 02:49.050
They finally put a brake
system on that thing.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.270
It beats slamming
into that boulder.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.625
Although, it did knock out
that troublesome wisdom tooth.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.167
Thanks, guys,
but I'm not in the mood.

02:58.203 --> 02:59.483
I'm just gonna go
brush my teeth.

03:01.573 --> 03:03.506
But...

03:03.542 --> 03:05.375
He's brushing his teeth.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.250
He hasn't done
that since... Ever!

03:08.797 --> 03:10.117
I am surprised
he still has teeth.

03:12.434 --> 03:15.259
Dude, is something going on?

03:15.295 --> 03:17.215
I can't talk with
toothpaste in my mouth.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.240
Then spit!

03:19.724 --> 03:20.724
Oh.

03:22.694 --> 03:25.470
Dude, not on my shoes!

03:25.506 --> 03:26.071
I guess I should be grateful he
wasn't going to the bathroom.

03:27.557 --> 03:29.924
Jorge,

03:29.960 --> 03:31.868
if you are having a
problem, you can tell us.

03:31.903 --> 03:33.361
It's nothing.

03:33.396 --> 03:34.804
Dude, it's okay.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.514
I've been a counselor
for a long time,

03:36.550 --> 03:37.590
and I've heard everything.

03:37.876 --> 03:38.876
Okay, fine!

03:39.886 --> 03:40.926
The truth is, I'm...

03:42.489 --> 03:43.730
Scared of goats!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.782
Except that.

03:45.817 --> 03:49.561
Those goats at the camp petting
zoo totally freak me out,

03:49.596 --> 03:51.638
with their beady eyes
and pointy horns.

03:51.674 --> 03:54.091
They're like tiny, furry demons!

03:54.126 --> 03:55.625
So are the kids in Badger cabin,

03:55.660 --> 03:57.127
but you don't
run away from them.

03:57.162 --> 04:00.154
Actually, Xander, the fear
of goats is quite common.

04:00.190 --> 04:02.132
BOTH: It is?

04:02.167 --> 04:05.168
Absolutely. There are
many forms of zoophobia.

04:05.204 --> 04:08.546
I myself am terrified
of jumbo shrimp.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.606
Even their name is a lie!

04:10.642 --> 04:12.722
Well, that sure makes the
goat thing seem less weird.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.752
(CHUCKLING)

04:15.422 --> 04:17.589
(THUMPING)

04:17.624 --> 04:20.884
Guys, these campers
are crazy hungry!

04:20.919 --> 04:23.470
It's like a zombie
apocalypse out there!

04:23.547 --> 04:25.738
They're about to use a kayak
as a battering ram!

04:25.773 --> 04:27.774
Isn't the pizza ready yet?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.810
It's ready to do
something, all right.

04:30.420 --> 04:31.761
It's gonna blow!

04:31.797 --> 04:33.329
Run! (BOTH SCREAMING)

04:33.365 --> 04:34.365
(BOILER RUMBLING)

04:41.865 --> 04:44.140
Emma, did you by any chance

04:44.176 --> 04:45.608
put all of this
baking powder in the dough?

04:45.643 --> 04:48.363
Of course, because we were
baking the pizza. Duh.

04:51.449 --> 04:54.751
Okay, teaching moment.

04:54.786 --> 04:57.078
A little baking powder
makes things rise.

04:57.113 --> 04:59.153
A lot of baking powder
makes things go boom!

04:59.991 --> 05:01.933
Oh, please...

05:01.969 --> 05:03.877
The next thing you're
going to tell me

05:03.912 --> 05:04.511
is that I shouldn't have put
those cans in the microwave.

05:04.546 --> 05:05.786
(MICROWAVE BEEPING) (EXPLOSION)

05:09.734 --> 05:11.926
and I really,
really miss you guys.

05:13.121 --> 05:14.588
Hey, Mrs. Kipling,

05:14.623 --> 05:16.263
how many S's in "miss"?

05:16.499 --> 05:17.499
(SNORTS)

05:18.477 --> 05:19.477
Five it is.

05:24.916 --> 05:26.956
Dude, you just missed
a giant pizza explosion!

05:29.738 --> 05:30.954
You can't just sit
around here all day

05:30.989 --> 05:32.638
because you're afraid of goats.

05:32.674 --> 05:33.674
They're out there.

05:35.644 --> 05:37.402
So, Ravi and I
came up with a way

05:37.437 --> 05:38.953
to help you get over your fear.

05:38.989 --> 05:40.989
Hey, bring in Gilbert Goatfried.

05:41.892 --> 05:43.358
(BLEATING) Oh.

05:43.393 --> 05:44.993
Do not be scared, Jorge.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.512
(BLEATING)

05:48.331 --> 05:49.331
He's so cute!

05:51.143 --> 05:54.119
I mean... Cute in
a terrifying way.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.154
That's probably how
he lures in his victims.

05:57.782 --> 05:59.991
I promise you, he's harmless.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.127
Unless you try to
put a leash on him.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.795
In which case, you will
get an ankle biting

06:03.830 --> 06:04.996
you will not soon forget.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.031
(BLEATING)

06:07.358 --> 06:09.976
Aw, he's just a baby.

06:10.011 --> 06:12.186
Shouldn't he be with his mommy?

06:12.222 --> 06:14.931
No, once a baby goat
is a couple of months old,

06:14.966 --> 06:17.225
it does not need
its mommy anymore.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.976
Although, Gilbert still needs
to learn some manners.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.080
(BLEATING)

06:22.115 --> 06:24.858
Being without his family
must make him sad.

06:24.893 --> 06:26.653
I think it also
makes him hungry.

06:27.913 --> 06:29.796
Hey, these are
my favorite pants!

06:29.831 --> 06:31.848
(GOAT BLEATING)

06:31.883 --> 06:33.607
If I were not a vegetarian,

06:33.643 --> 06:35.968
I would straight up kabob you.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.037
Don't you talk to him like that!

06:38.072 --> 06:39.552
He's going through
a lot right now!

06:41.676 --> 06:42.959
Jorge's cured!

06:42.994 --> 06:45.636
Our plan worked. Indeed.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.797
How fortunate that we are
psychologically intuitive,

06:47.832 --> 06:49.912
and had access to a goat!

06:51.945 --> 06:53.453
I know, little buddy.

06:53.488 --> 06:54.528
You miss your family.

06:55.424 --> 06:56.424
And you know what?

06:56.849 --> 06:59.142
So do I.

06:59.177 --> 07:00.677
We need to figure out
a way for us to go home.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.404
(BLEATING)

07:03.440 --> 07:07.141
And if you need to go
potty, do it in Ravi's bed.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.476
He's the one who
wanted to kabob you.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.511
(BLEATING)

07:15.526 --> 07:17.352
Hey, Gladys. Not now, kid.

07:17.387 --> 07:19.395
I'm registering
for my wedding gifts.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.239
Listen, you may have noticed

07:21.275 --> 07:23.658
I've seemed
a little down lately...

07:23.693 --> 07:26.744
Nope. I notice your parents'
checks clearing, and I stop there.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.980
(GASPING) Do you
like this gravy boat?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.749
Gladys, I'm trying to
tell you...

07:30.784 --> 07:32.167
I'm not happy here.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.019
Well, for once I am!

07:34.054 --> 07:35.894
So quit harshing
my wedding buzz!

07:36.906 --> 07:38.531
But I want to go home.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.083
Sorry, I have two rules.

07:40.118 --> 07:42.527
I don't give refunds,

07:42.563 --> 07:45.324
and I don't tell the health
inspector my real name.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.091
Well, do kids ever get
kicked out of camp?

07:48.126 --> 07:50.051
Only if they get in
a lot of trouble.

07:50.086 --> 07:53.755
Oh, sterling silver
sporks! (GASPING)

07:53.790 --> 07:55.331
Trouble, huh?

07:55.366 --> 07:57.434
Trouble's my middle name.

07:57.469 --> 08:00.203
Hey, Trouble, check out
this fondue pot.

08:00.238 --> 08:02.318
Doesn't that just scream
Nigerian royalty? Oh.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.817
Glad, I'm not going
to that wedding.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.092
MS. GLADYS: You're not invited!

08:11.007 --> 08:12.657
All right, Woodchucks,

08:12.692 --> 08:14.425
just because the entire
kitchen blew up

08:14.461 --> 08:16.061
(COUGHS) Emma.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.720
Which destroyed all the food...

08:17.756 --> 08:19.755
(COUGHS) Emma.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.658
So each cabin has been
left to fend for themselves.

08:22.694 --> 08:24.414
I know, I know. (COUGHS) Emma.

08:25.814 --> 08:27.839
Doesn't mean we'll
never eat again.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.307
All we have to do
is find a kale salad

08:29.343 --> 08:31.543
with a fig balsamic
reduction tree.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.716
It's a good thing
you city girls are pretty.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.800
I think our best bet

08:38.835 --> 08:40.543
is to head to the lake
and catch some fish.

08:40.578 --> 08:43.404
No way.

08:43.439 --> 08:46.524
Jorge's been spending a lot
of time in the lake lately,

08:46.559 --> 08:50.344
and I'd rather starve
than eat fart fish!

08:50.379 --> 08:52.780
Guys, we've got all the food we
need right here in the forest.

08:52.815 --> 08:54.399
Mother Nature provides for all!

08:56.586 --> 08:58.319
Except for you,
Bobcat cabin! Beat it!

09:01.692 --> 09:03.357
Okay, but we should be cautious

09:03.393 --> 09:05.710
before we ingest any
wild fruits or plants.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.113
Many are poisonous
and could kill you.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.681
You know what else
could kill you?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.817
Starving.

09:12.852 --> 09:16.212
Lucky for you guys, you're
with a wilderness expert.

09:16.247 --> 09:17.967
I know these woods
like the back of my hand.

09:19.851 --> 09:20.967
Where did that scar come from?

09:21.003 --> 09:23.837
That's a birthmark. Oh, right.

09:23.872 --> 09:25.580
Now... Let us be
one with nature,

09:25.615 --> 09:27.295
and the food will find us.

09:32.122 --> 09:34.362
Hmm, these leaves feel like
they're exfoliating my skin.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.199
It's kinda tingly.

09:38.794 --> 09:40.912
Lou, these are diablo leaves!

09:40.947 --> 09:43.523
They're poisonous.
They cause fever...

09:43.558 --> 09:45.591
Ooh, I'm hot! Fatigue...

09:45.627 --> 09:47.010
(YAWNS) And super tired...

09:47.045 --> 09:48.519
And one more thing...

09:48.554 --> 09:50.379
(SCREAMS) A fire
breathing dragon!

09:50.415 --> 09:52.123
(SCREAMING)

09:53.994 --> 09:55.514
Oh, yeah, delusions!

10:02.202 --> 10:04.068
I am so glad we were
able to help Jorge

10:04.104 --> 10:06.571
overcome his fear of goats.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.608
Yep, helping kids is the best
part about being a counselor.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.602
Well, that, and watching cute CITs
jump on the water trampoline.

10:12.637 --> 10:15.438
(CHORTLES) I do get some
serious air on that bad boy.

10:16.741 --> 10:17.781
I meant your sister.

10:19.377 --> 10:20.377
So, shall I break?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.713
(ENGINE REVVING)

10:23.748 --> 10:25.748
(CRASHING)

10:25.784 --> 10:26.784
(KIDS GASPING)

10:30.822 --> 10:32.238
Jorge!

10:32.273 --> 10:33.833
The lake is over there!

10:35.610 --> 10:37.293
Oh, yeah. Oops.

10:39.664 --> 10:41.146
First you are scared of a goat,

10:41.182 --> 10:41.964
and then, you wreck a boat?

10:41.999 --> 10:45.760
What, are you acting out
or writing a children's book?

10:45.796 --> 10:47.987
We have to clean
this up right now.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.064
If Gladys sees it,
she'll have a cow!

10:50.099 --> 10:51.819
Oh, great, now I'm doing it!

10:52.677 --> 10:54.493
Xander is right.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.689
You do not want Gladys to
send you home, do you?

10:56.723 --> 10:58.289
Of course not!

10:58.325 --> 11:00.833
But how else
will I learn my lesson?

11:00.868 --> 11:03.695
Here's how.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.404
You will spend the rest of the
day in our cabin, mister!

11:05.439 --> 11:07.323
Um, he ate two bowls
of chili for breakfast.

11:07.358 --> 11:10.318
You will spend the rest of the
day in the girls' cabin, mister!

11:12.639 --> 11:13.663
Hey, guys.

11:13.698 --> 11:16.432
I just took Lou to the
infirmary and we lost her.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.558
(GASPING)

11:17.593 --> 11:19.418
She's dead?

11:19.453 --> 11:21.713
(SHRIEKING) I didn't
even get to say goodbye!

11:21.748 --> 11:24.849
(CHUCKLING) No, I mean she
just ran off into the woods.

11:24.926 --> 11:26.967
But I'm sure by now
she'll be back to normal.

11:27.003 --> 11:28.094
LOU: (INHALING) Whoosh.

11:28.129 --> 11:30.304
Whoosh. Whoosh.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.882
Look at me! I'm riding a dragon!

11:32.917 --> 11:34.258
Or not.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.894
Whoa, boy! Whoa!

11:39.190 --> 11:41.099
Who's my fire-breathing buddy?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.201
Who lays waste
to entire villages?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.853
You do, yes, you do!

11:45.888 --> 11:47.304
Yes, you do! Yeah. Lou,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.732
there is no dragon.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.534
(SCREAMS)
Forest nymph! So tired.

11:54.864 --> 11:55.864
That was odd.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.369
She thought I was a leprechaun.

12:02.405 --> 12:05.631
She kept demanding that I
take her to my pot of gold.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.733
Well, obviously, Lou's not
going to be much help.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.702
But I can set a snare trap!

12:09.737 --> 12:11.029
You know how to do that?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.514
We have two brothers.

12:13.549 --> 12:13.890
It's the only way we kept them
out of our slumber parties.

12:15.793 --> 12:18.144
Great, so let's build this trap!

12:18.180 --> 12:20.300
At this point, I'd eat anything.

12:20.598 --> 12:22.240
Oh, no, no, no.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.075
You're not gonna eat my dragon!

12:25.152 --> 12:27.278
Fly, Seymour, fly! Fly.

12:30.275 --> 12:32.292
Should we go after her?

12:32.327 --> 12:34.167
Eh, she'll be fine.
She has a dragon.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.824
Done. Okay, now let's
hide behind those bushes

12:39.859 --> 12:41.259
and wait for dinner
to come to us.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.254
I hope it's orange chicken.

12:46.224 --> 12:49.542
(RUSTLING)

12:49.577 --> 12:51.327
I hear something!

12:51.362 --> 12:53.654
Whatever it is,
I call drumstick!

12:53.689 --> 12:54.764
(RUSTLING)

12:55.742 --> 12:57.866
(MOANING)

12:57.902 --> 12:58.993
Sounds like we caught a moose!

12:59.028 --> 13:01.896
Yay! That's good.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.971
Although, I'd rather
have chocolate mousse.

13:10.381 --> 13:12.748
Actually, we caught a Lou.

13:12.783 --> 13:13.863
Is there a permit for that?

13:14.661 --> 13:16.101
OMG!

13:16.137 --> 13:17.670
Lou, are you okay?

13:17.705 --> 13:19.338
Hey, tall, bark, and handsome.

13:19.373 --> 13:20.556
You live around here?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.242
(SHUSHING)

13:22.277 --> 13:24.037
Quiet, Seymour, Mommy's talking.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.350
Well, I think we know what
we need to do with Lou...

13:30.385 --> 13:32.385
Season her up,
and toss her on the grill.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.347
What? I'm extremely hungry.

13:43.106 --> 13:46.799
I cannot believe Jorge
drove a boat onto the lawn.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.943
I can't believe you didn't help
me move it back to the lake.

13:48.979 --> 13:50.903
I did help. I cheered you on,

13:50.938 --> 13:52.898
and reminded you
to lift with your legs!

13:55.652 --> 13:57.760
Jorge, we need to talk...

13:57.796 --> 14:01.381
Oh, no! He's gone.
And so is his stuff.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.891
Perhaps he has just
decided to tidy up!

14:03.927 --> 14:05.843
Oh, who am I kidding?
He has run away,

14:05.878 --> 14:07.758
like girls do from me
during prom week.

14:08.122 --> 14:09.122
He left a note.

14:11.692 --> 14:13.876
"Thanks, guys. I'll miss you.

14:13.912 --> 14:17.129
"Ravi, I finally cleaned my
hair out of the shower drain.

14:17.165 --> 14:18.931
(SCOFFS) "I left it
by your toothbrush",

14:18.967 --> 14:21.327
"so you'll remember me. (GAGS)"

14:22.887 --> 14:24.678
"Love, Jorge."

14:24.714 --> 14:26.634
I am simultaneously
touched and revolted.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.282
We have to go find him!

14:28.318 --> 14:30.151
Absolutely!

14:30.186 --> 14:32.186
And perhaps stop
to buy a new toothbrush.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.287
If the bus driver
asks any questions,

14:41.323 --> 14:42.638
you're just a weird-looking dog.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.824
(BLEATING)

14:44.859 --> 14:47.752
(GASPING) Jorge, thank the gods!

14:47.787 --> 14:49.394
We have been looking
everywhere for you.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.305
Dude, we were worried sick!

14:51.340 --> 14:52.582
Ravi almost threw up.

14:52.617 --> 14:53.657
That was from the running.

14:55.819 --> 14:58.037
Jorge, why did you run away?

14:58.073 --> 15:00.414
Uh... (BLEATING)

15:00.449 --> 15:03.393
I wanted to take Gilbert
back to his family.

15:03.428 --> 15:04.744
He's homesick.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.062
(BLEATING)

15:06.097 --> 15:08.814
Oh, so that's what this
whole thing has been about.

15:09.851 --> 15:11.267
You're homesick!

15:11.302 --> 15:13.427
Am not!

15:13.462 --> 15:15.502
Dude, why didn't you
just tell us the truth?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.374
Because I was embarrassed.

15:18.409 --> 15:20.225
I didn't want you
to think I was wimpy.

15:20.261 --> 15:22.011
Have you met Ravi?

15:22.046 --> 15:23.086
He's scared of shrimp!

15:23.939 --> 15:26.123
Just the jumbos.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.158
They are the bullies
of the shrimp world.

15:29.771 --> 15:31.487
Jorge...

15:31.522 --> 15:33.756
Why did you suddenly
become homesick?

15:33.792 --> 15:35.917
Because my family beat a horse,

15:35.952 --> 15:38.494
and I wasn't there to help them!

15:38.529 --> 15:40.289
Maybe I should hold the goat.

15:41.415 --> 15:43.483
I meant a pinata.

15:43.518 --> 15:46.285
It was for my
sister's second birthday,

15:46.321 --> 15:48.220
and seeing all the pictures

15:48.256 --> 15:50.376
made me realize how
much I miss my family.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.666
Aww,

15:52.702 --> 15:54.201
I know just how you feel.

15:54.236 --> 15:55.944
I miss my brother, Luke.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.872
He is at summer school,

15:57.874 --> 16:00.074
and once he learns to write,
I hope I get a letter.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.113
I really miss
our family dinners.

16:05.148 --> 16:07.673
My grandma and mom
cook for hours,

16:07.708 --> 16:09.474
and my grandpa and dad complain

16:09.510 --> 16:11.630
about how long it's taking.

16:13.622 --> 16:16.416
Jorge, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:16.451 --> 16:19.652
Everybody gets homesick. Indeed.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.295
In fact, Xander told me that
he cried for three weeks

16:21.330 --> 16:23.089
when he first got to camp.

16:23.124 --> 16:26.108
Hey, I told you that
in confidence!

16:26.143 --> 16:27.376
Oh. Well, you should not have.

16:27.411 --> 16:28.811
I am a real blabber-mouth.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.007
By the way, Zuri still
sleeps with a night-light.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.842
But you did not
hear that from me.

16:35.419 --> 16:37.419
I'll tell you what, Jorge.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.497
Come back to camp with us.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.357
Give us one chance
to convince you to stay.

16:42.393 --> 16:45.044
Then if you still want to
go home tomorrow,

16:45.079 --> 16:46.178
I'll pay for your ticket home.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.947
(BLEATING)

16:47.982 --> 16:50.216
(CHUCKLES) And Gilbert's.

16:50.251 --> 16:54.195
Well... Maybe I could
stay one more night.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.772
Great! Now let's
get back to camp.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.775
Wha... Can we please
take the bus back? Nope.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.331
Because a bus hasn't
stopped here in 20 years.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.890
(BLEATING)

17:07.276 --> 17:08.316
Can I ride the goat?

17:11.339 --> 17:14.006
Okay, this dinner will be great!

17:14.041 --> 17:15.801
Think of it as surf-and-turf.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.342
Without the surf.

17:17.378 --> 17:18.458
And with real turf.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.789
Psst, Emma,

17:21.825 --> 17:23.849
don't move.

17:23.884 --> 17:26.385
There's a garden gnome
on your back... (GASPS)

17:26.420 --> 17:27.420
And it looks angry.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.231
Got it! (GASPING)

17:31.267 --> 17:32.141
It's on my throat!

17:32.176 --> 17:33.176
(CHOKING)

17:36.472 --> 17:38.280
On the bright side, she's no
longer seeing the dragon.

17:38.316 --> 17:39.316
LOU: (THUDDING) Ow.

17:41.336 --> 17:42.818
(GASPS) (LOU GRUNTING)

17:42.853 --> 17:45.863
Wow! I can't believe she's
wrestling an imaginary gnome.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.639
LOU: (THUDDING) Ow.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.291
I can't believe she's losing.

17:49.327 --> 17:51.652
LOU: (THUDDING) Ow.

17:51.687 --> 17:53.538
Yeah, you think she'd
have the upper hand,

17:53.573 --> 17:54.733
being real and all.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.057
(LOU GRUNTING)

17:57.092 --> 17:58.383
ALL: Oh!

17:58.419 --> 18:00.527
That had to hurt.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.546
Why did Lou just fall
into the fire pit?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.742
Because gnomes fight dirty.

18:05.977 --> 18:09.011
Anyway, Jorge's
a little homesick.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.095
Do you guys think
you could help us

18:10.131 --> 18:11.171
make a special dinner
for him tonight?

18:11.207 --> 18:13.907
We can try,

18:13.942 --> 18:15.551
but we're a little low on supplies
since we blew up the kitchen.

18:15.586 --> 18:18.078
BOTH: (COUGHING) Emma.

18:18.114 --> 18:20.439
All we've got is what
we found in the woods.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.891
Do you guys have
anything we can eat?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.426
Well, we do have one thing...

18:23.461 --> 18:26.070
(GOAT BLEATING)

18:26.105 --> 18:28.705
But I don't think it would
go over well with Jorge.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.145
Although, I know something
he really would love.

18:32.603 --> 18:35.471
(EXHALES) Are you sure this
is going to make Jorge happy?

18:35.506 --> 18:38.586
It better, or we shaved all those
sheep in the petting zoo for nothing.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.586
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:45.391 --> 18:47.199
Hey, guys... Welcome to
dinner with your family...

18:47.234 --> 18:48.767
Son!

18:48.802 --> 18:50.842
EMMA: Welcome home, Jorge!

18:52.832 --> 18:54.712
I hope you wiped your shoes
on the mat.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.344
What the hair is going on here?

18:58.379 --> 18:59.704
We know how much
you missed family dinner,

18:59.739 --> 19:02.014
so we decided to
recreate it for you.

19:02.049 --> 19:05.676
Well, if it isn't
our little grandbaby!

19:05.712 --> 19:07.327
He's such a handsome young man!

19:07.363 --> 19:08.603
(COUGHS)

19:09.324 --> 19:11.448
He takes after me!

19:11.484 --> 19:13.700
Luckily, he didn't get
your nose hair.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.227
It's like snakes
comin' out of there!

19:15.262 --> 19:16.262
Hey!

19:18.616 --> 19:20.616
If you guys are supposed
to be my family,

19:20.651 --> 19:21.651
where's my baby sister?

19:26.207 --> 19:29.417
This is humiliating.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.344
You know, you could
try and sell it a little more.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.938
Sorry. This is humiliating,

19:34.973 --> 19:36.853
wah-wah-goo-goo. Better?

19:38.619 --> 19:40.699
Have a seat, everyone.
Dinner's almost ready!

19:42.306 --> 19:44.226
Don't slouch, dear. Posture.

19:45.676 --> 19:46.968
I feel like an idiot!

19:47.003 --> 19:48.468
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:48.504 --> 19:49.984
I mean, I just made a boom boom.

19:51.907 --> 19:53.941
So, what's for dinner, dear?

19:53.976 --> 19:56.084
Forest stew, sweetie.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

19:56.119 --> 19:58.345
When is it going to be ready?

19:58.381 --> 20:01.882
I would like to eat
before I am in the grave.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.443
One more complaint,
and I'll put you there!

20:04.478 --> 20:06.558
Good! Then, I would finally
get some peace and quiet!

20:08.708 --> 20:11.483
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

20:11.518 --> 20:15.504
Dear, this was supposed to be a
very special dinner for Jorge.

20:15.539 --> 20:17.497
Is this really the best
you could do?

20:17.533 --> 20:19.174
Yes, honey. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

20:19.210 --> 20:23.604
It's not like there are any wild
hamburgers growing out in the woods.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.332
In my day, we ate what
was put on our plate,

20:26.367 --> 20:28.893
or we didn't eat!

20:28.970 --> 20:31.737
How could you eat at all
with your gums flapping

20:31.773 --> 20:33.613
worse than the skin
under your arms?

20:34.216 --> 20:36.417
Ow!

20:36.452 --> 20:37.977
You filled that
with hard candies!

20:40.080 --> 20:41.722
Look, Emma,
all I'm saying is that

20:41.757 --> 20:42.898
this looks like a tree threw up!

20:42.933 --> 20:45.568
Easy to complain about a meal
when you didn't cook it!

20:45.603 --> 20:48.321
(ALL CLAMORING)

20:48.356 --> 20:49.356
Everyone, stop!

20:50.717 --> 20:52.750
I'm sorry, Jorge.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.476
We really messed up
your family dinner.

20:54.512 --> 20:58.605
Yes, our attempt to give you a taste
of home has failed miserably.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.007
What are you talking about?

21:00.042 --> 21:01.675
This is just like home!

21:01.711 --> 21:03.627
ALL: It is?

21:03.662 --> 21:06.706
Yeah, the food is terrible,
like my mom's cooking.

21:06.741 --> 21:08.782
My grandma's hitting my grandpa.

21:08.817 --> 21:11.894
And everyone's arguing,
just like my family!

21:11.929 --> 21:14.429
All that's missing is
my kooky Aunt Rosa.

21:14.465 --> 21:16.390
Seymour the dragon
ate the gnome!

21:18.344 --> 21:20.685
Hey, Leprechaun!

21:20.721 --> 21:22.112
I still want that gold.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.272
Right after nap time.

21:26.461 --> 21:27.461
And there she is!

21:29.338 --> 21:33.106
Wait, so our plan
actually worked?

21:33.142 --> 21:36.168
Totally. There's only one
thing you guys got wrong.

21:36.245 --> 21:38.170
I'm the only one in
my family with hair like this.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.780
Everyone else is blonde.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.515
Thank goodness!

21:41.551 --> 21:43.071
This thing is
suffocating my follicles!

21:45.012 --> 21:46.745
I can't believe
you did all this for me.

21:46.780 --> 21:48.647
Why wouldn't we?

21:48.683 --> 21:51.191
You're a Grizzly,
and Grizzlies stick together.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.510
We wanted camp to feel a
little more like home.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.220
Well, now it does. Thanks, guys.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.110
Wait. So, does this mean
you are staying?

22:01.187 --> 22:04.262
Yup. Besides, I've gotta
keep an eye on Gilbert.

22:04.298 --> 22:06.640
I heard some weirdos
snuck into the petting zoo

22:06.675 --> 22:08.035
and shaved all the sheep.

22:10.338 --> 22:11.338
Uh... Let's toast

22:12.957 --> 22:15.057
to our Camp Kikiwaka family.

22:15.092 --> 22:16.541
We put the "fun"
in "dysfunctional."

22:16.577 --> 22:17.577
(CHUCKLING)

22:21.866 --> 22:23.749
(ALL CHOKING)

22:23.785 --> 22:26.735
What is this stuff? Bark tea?

22:26.770 --> 22:28.770
Don't look at us.
That's just the tap water.

22:34.127 --> 22:37.229
Well, I waited at
the airport for six hours

22:37.306 --> 22:39.548
but Prince Mutumbo never showed up!
(SOBBING)

22:39.583 --> 22:41.959
There's a shock.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.754
I really wanted
to be a princess!

22:44.805 --> 22:46.705
Maybe you still can be.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.824
Our mom says a girl
has to kiss a lot of frogs

22:48.859 --> 22:50.201
before she finds her prince.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.611
But I've been kissing frogs
for years!

22:52.647 --> 22:53.821
That explains the warts.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.784
Hey, guys.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.001
Hey, Lou. How are you feeling?

23:00.037 --> 23:02.187
Much better.

23:02.222 --> 23:04.302
I finally stopped seeing
all that crazy stuff.

23:05.326 --> 23:06.550
Killer shrimp!

23:06.586 --> 23:07.586
(SCREAMING)

23:08.679 --> 23:09.795
(LAUGHING)

23:12.658 --> 23:18.019
I spoke too soon.
