00:14.700 --> 00:15.700
So?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.620
Just kidding. I passed the test.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.700
I knew you would pass.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.380
Even though, statistically speaking,

00:26.460 --> 00:28.500
innocent people fail lie detector tests
50% of the time,

00:28.620 --> 00:30.980
and the guilty are more used
to the psycho-dynamics of lying

00:31.060 --> 00:32.460
on a regular basis, so...

00:33.780 --> 00:36.140
They're just numbers.
They don't really mean anything.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.300
- Thanks, Hayley.
- No problem.

00:38.380 --> 00:41.260
Anytime you need someone
to take a lie detector test for you,

00:41.340 --> 00:42.340
I'm your girl.

00:43.180 --> 00:44.900
Cool.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.460
- We need more time.
- I think you've had enough time here.

00:48.540 --> 00:49.540
Listen, Louis...

00:49.620 --> 00:52.060
If you don't have a search warrant,
you're no longer welcome here.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.620
I see.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.060
Take care, Louis.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.620
I know the Taser's here somewhere.
We'll get him a warrant.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.220
Hey.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.180
Relax, I'm not going to hurt
your diaphragm again.

02:17.980 --> 02:21.860
Listen, um, thanks for taking
the lie detector test for me.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.220
Sure. You're welcome.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.060
But if you ever snoop
through my stuff again,

02:27.140 --> 02:29.300
I will do more than hurt your diaphragm.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.620
- You're getting pretty good.
- Thanks.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.340
Now I know three chords.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.100
- You can start your own band now.
- Mmm.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.180
- What's wrong with my Louie?
- Here, let me see it.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.140
I've been having problems with it all day.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.780
- Um, that's because this is a fake.
- Are you sure?

02:53.860 --> 02:56.300
- So where is my Louie?
- Here.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.980
I'm checking to see if your real Louie
had access here last night.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.700
There you are. 5:00 a.m.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.460
- That's impossible. I was asleep.
- Your Louie wasn't.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.700
You meet any Eagles yesterday?

03:08.460 --> 03:09.980
No. Why would I hang out with them?

03:10.940 --> 03:12.100
What about your brother?

03:13.180 --> 03:14.860
I saw him at the cafeteria, but...

03:18.500 --> 03:20.660
So that's why they
were being so nice to him.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.060
Stole my Louie so they
could break into our clubhouse.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.380
Tell me it's not true, Alex.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.660
- What?
- Did you steal my Louie?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.700
Did you hug me and make peace with me
just to take my Louie?

03:45.580 --> 03:46.940
Alex, is it true?

03:49.300 --> 03:50.580
What do you want from me?

04:26.820 --> 04:27.820
Drop something?

04:28.380 --> 04:30.780
Oh. Hey.

04:30.860 --> 04:31.740
Hey.

04:31.820 --> 04:34.140
Are you going on vacation already?
You just got here.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.180
Actually, I decided to go home.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.060
Oh.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.820
Was it the polygraph test?

04:42.540 --> 04:43.540
No.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.180
It's just this place
is a little too much for me.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.860
You know, the first few days
at the Greenhouse

04:50.940 --> 04:52.380
are always the most stressful.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.580
I'd be worried about you
if you were feeling fine right now.

04:56.860 --> 04:59.700
I know what you mean, but it's not that.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.860
It's just not for me.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.940
Can you make sure Alex gets this?

05:08.540 --> 05:10.420
And take care of him.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.220
Mmm-hmm. Just know our door
is always open to you.

05:15.740 --> 05:18.580
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate to come back.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.020
What is it?

06:01.020 --> 06:03.060
When did you have time
to cook all of this?

06:03.140 --> 06:05.380
I don't know.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.700
Running on the beach
sort of filled me up with energy.

06:09.260 --> 06:12.020
So I thought I'd make us some dinner.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.300
I was looking for you, actually.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.940
And I saw you at the beach.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.460
Yeah.

06:22.540 --> 06:26.620
I was just clearing my head, you know.
Throwing rocks in the ocean.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.260
You were throwing rocks?

06:30.340 --> 06:34.300
Silly, huh?
It sort of helped me relax.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.980
All right, what you got for me, Miller?

07:00.060 --> 07:03.020
Captain, I managed to reroute
the water supply to the laundry room.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.220
- Look.
- You get the paint from the storage room?

07:05.900 --> 07:08.420
Perfect. That's what I call revenge.
Great work, guys.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.060
Eagles are going down!

07:14.860 --> 07:17.100
I forgot what it was like
not to have seven other people

07:17.180 --> 07:18.620
snore in your ear when you sleep.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.060
Did Alex call?

07:24.740 --> 07:27.700
- Dad?
- Huh? I'm sorry, did you say something?

07:27.780 --> 07:29.220
I asked if Alex called.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.060
So, I'm joining a convent.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.700
Yeah, I'm gonna move
to the Vatican next week.

07:37.260 --> 07:38.740
That sounds great, sweetie.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.660
Uh... Wait, what?

07:40.740 --> 07:45.220
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm sorry, I... I was just...

07:45.300 --> 07:48.260
Look, a month before your mother
went up to the space station,

07:48.340 --> 07:50.860
she was meeting with all kinds of people
I'd never met, and...

07:51.580 --> 07:55.420
I never bothered to...
to read these documents properly.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.860
What's the point of all this?

07:56.940 --> 07:59.780
I want to know what your mom was doing
during the last month of her life.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.780
Hey, wait.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.140
You expecting anyone?

08:05.700 --> 08:07.180
Yeah. Owen and Meredith.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.420
Maybe she went for a walk.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.900
Her bed was made.
She didn't spend the night in our dorm.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.620
She did seem upset yesterday.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.340
Something's not right.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.220
Cover for me here, guys.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.820
Hey. You okay, kid?
You know, with your sister and all?

08:38.780 --> 08:40.260
- I'm relieved.
- Yeah?

08:40.340 --> 08:42.340
Yeah. We're gonna kick
Whitney's butt today.

08:42.419 --> 08:45.540
- Yeah!
- They're gonna cry all the way home.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.620
- Yeah!
- They might as well go home right now.

08:48.700 --> 08:49.700
Yeah!

08:49.780 --> 08:52.380
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Eagles! Eagles!

08:52.460 --> 08:54.900
- Eagles! Eagle...
- Whoa.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.540
- Bro...
- What is this?

08:57.660 --> 08:58.660
What the...

09:00.980 --> 09:02.340
It must be the Ravens.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.340
- But how?
- I don't know.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.020
Parker, I didn't know
you joined the WNBA.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.420
Very funny, Brooke.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.780
Help me get this off.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.540
I don't understand.
Why didn't she say something?

09:16.300 --> 09:18.260
I guess she didn't want to bother anyone.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.780
Doesn't make any sense.
I mean, she belongs here.

09:22.980 --> 09:26.380
Leo, you know the Greenhouse
is not for everyone.

09:29.660 --> 09:32.500
You know, we made a bet to see
how long it would take you to break.

09:32.580 --> 09:35.900
I said two days.
So you owe me five bucks, Owen.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.340
Five? I thought it was worth at least ten.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.460
It's not like you wanted to be
the next president or something, right?

09:43.660 --> 09:45.340
So, what did I miss while I was gone?

09:45.420 --> 09:48.700
Oh, my God. They're giving us
way too much homework right now, though.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.220
Probably nothing compares
to the Greenhouse, though, right?

09:51.300 --> 09:54.340
Actually, all we got
was just a glorified treasure hunt.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.500
Such a pretentious school.

09:57.580 --> 10:01.060
Look, the main thing is
is that you're here with us now.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.300
It's what matters.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.940
So what does it mean to be a leader?

10:06.020 --> 10:09.620
Is it something you're born with?
Is it something you learn?

10:09.700 --> 10:12.780
I would like us to think
about these questions using a test case.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.140
We all know what a test case is, right?

10:15.220 --> 10:17.580
I know what a case officer is.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.500
Any ideas for a leader
who could be our test case?

10:21.580 --> 10:24.780
How about the best of the best,
Mr. Steve Jobs? RIP.

10:24.860 --> 10:28.620
But he didn't lead a country.
What about Barack Obama?

10:28.700 --> 10:34.260
- Or an artist, like David Bowie.
- Over Kim Kardashian?

10:37.580 --> 10:39.260
These are all good examples.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.340
I actually thought we'd start
with someone you all know.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.500
Turn on your Louies.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.940
Say hi to Sheriff Woody Pride,
our leader test case.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.140
Your first activity this year
is a short one.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.460
I want you to think of one word.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.900
When we meet again,
I want each of you to give me one word

10:53.980 --> 10:57.340
which describes Sheriff Woody as a leader.
I'll see you in a few hours.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.180
I hope you bring some interesting ideas
to the table.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.340
One word? That's it?

11:02.420 --> 11:04.740
You want us to think
about Sheriff Woody all day?

11:05.580 --> 11:06.900
Welcome to the Greenhouse.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.540
I can't believe a cartoon character
is our test case.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.580
Who invented Woody? Pixar.

11:14.660 --> 11:19.180
And who was Pixar's chairman of the board?
The best of the best, Mr. Steve Jobs. RIP.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.180
I loved Mr. Potato Head.

11:21.260 --> 11:24.020
Jackie, who did you like better,
Woody or Buzz Lightyear?

11:25.580 --> 11:26.700
I don't know.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.820
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.740
But listen...

11:41.620 --> 11:43.860
would you want to work together
on the Toy Story assignment?

11:43.940 --> 11:44.900
No.

11:45.420 --> 11:49.340
- You sure? Why not?
- 'Cause I work alone. Thanks.

11:51.060 --> 11:54.260
You're okay? You looked upset in class.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.860
- I'm fine.
- Oh, cool.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.180
Good luck.

12:00.260 --> 12:03.220
As Woody always says,
"To infinity and beyond!"

12:03.300 --> 12:05.620
Yeah, I love it
when he says that.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.140
Actually, Woody never says that.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.660
Buzz Lightyear says that.

12:11.420 --> 12:13.220
It's okay. I knew you never saw the movie.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.900
- What do you want from me, Max?
- Nothing.

12:17.140 --> 12:20.500
But I can help. You see, Woody
is this toy cowboy who belongs to a boy...

12:20.580 --> 12:24.380
Stop. I don't need your help.
Leave me alone.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.700
- Another leg cramp?
- It's nothing.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.820
You know, Leo's gonna be sorry
when I'm done with him.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.220
Like, I'm so tired of this guy just...

12:35.300 --> 12:37.620
Listen, I saw the medicine
in your locker, Daniel.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.220
What's wrong?

12:42.340 --> 12:45.220
I don't know.
Maybe you not respecting my privacy.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.980
I'll respect your privacy
when you stop keeping secrets from me.

12:50.460 --> 12:51.780
I should go.

12:56.580 --> 12:59.900
What do you mean you found my file?
I thought I deleted everything.

13:05.620 --> 13:06.700
There's no file.

13:07.740 --> 13:10.700
Sorry, it was the only way
I could get you to come here.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.900
What's this for?

13:13.980 --> 13:16.660
I figured you can't finish the assignment
if you haven't even seen it.

13:17.220 --> 13:20.980
I didn't know if you liked buttered
or not, so... I got you both.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.140
Here's a blanket
in case the AC is too strong.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.940
My servers are sensitive.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.940
You're really something,
Maximilian Miller.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.060
That's what my mom always says.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.420
Have fun. It's a great movie.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.420
Ew. Gross.

14:07.060 --> 14:08.820
Dad, come in here!

14:10.620 --> 14:11.620
Dad!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.900
How can you live like this?

14:16.060 --> 14:18.940
- Live how?
- In this filth.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.580
I mean, what is this,
a scientific experiment or something?

14:22.780 --> 14:26.020
If I'd have known you're coming,
I would have cleaned up a bit.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.780
Well, I didn't know I had to give
a heads-up before coming to my own home.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.820
You don't. You're right.

14:36.620 --> 14:37.900
I'll be in my room.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.340
Aren't you a bit curious
as to why I left the Greenhouse?

14:45.260 --> 14:47.980
Yeah, sure. I didn't wanna bother you.

14:48.060 --> 14:50.700
Bother me? How? By communicating with me?

14:50.780 --> 14:53.540
Why? You feel like I don't
communicate with you?

14:53.620 --> 14:55.540
You don't communicate with anyone.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.540
Only with Mom,
and she's not even here anymore.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.940
Now what's wrong with me
thinking about your mom?

15:00.020 --> 15:01.340
She's dead, Dad!

15:02.380 --> 15:03.460
She's not here!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.220
I mean, you don't care!

15:06.300 --> 15:09.100
You haven't said a word to me
since I got home!

15:10.460 --> 15:13.100
All you do is sit there
with that stupid bulletin board.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.340
But you and your two kids
are still alive.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.500
We're alive, Dad.

15:49.620 --> 15:51.740
Yeah?

15:58.540 --> 16:02.420
- What?
- As usual, you were right.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.740
I have to move on with my life.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.580
Thanks for reminding me what's important.

16:18.740 --> 16:19.780
You're welcome.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.700
Oh, and, uh... And one more thing.

16:34.780 --> 16:35.780
Hmm?

16:38.180 --> 16:39.740
This guy just showed up.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.900
- Hey.
- Hey, Woods.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.100
Dad, why are they back?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.620
Oh, he wanted to tell me
they found what they were looking for.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.860
- They found the missing ranger?
- They found the Taser.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.700
Off campus, thankfully.
A fisherman found it at the beach.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.859
So the Taser has nothing
to do with the Greenhouse.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.540
- Okay? End of story.
- Okay.

17:14.540 --> 17:15.859
What are you doing?

17:15.940 --> 17:18.619
Just looking for embarrassing photos
of you from the second grade.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.300
- Oh, here.
- Thanks.

17:23.260 --> 17:26.180
So, Leo, you here
to give me an inspirational speech

17:26.260 --> 17:27.859
about why I belong to the Greenhouse?

17:28.660 --> 17:32.620
Uh, I don't do speeches, Woods.
I just wanted to see where you grew up.

17:32.700 --> 17:37.420
- Look, I just came home to be with my dad.
- Really? Is that the only reason?

17:37.980 --> 17:38.980
He needed me.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.140
- What?
- I don't know.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.740
Your dad needed you.
Your brother needed you.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.380
When you gonna stop
taking care of everyone else

17:52.460 --> 17:53.740
and start taking care of yourself?

17:53.820 --> 17:55.380
I thought you don't do speeches.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.660
- This part always makes me cry, too.
- Shh!

18:09.660 --> 18:11.900
How long have you been there?

18:11.980 --> 18:13.700
I wanted to see the third act again.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.020
- It's a great movie, isn't it?
- It is.

18:18.380 --> 18:21.100
I feel stupid for not seeing it before.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.820
So what? Now you've seen it.

18:24.900 --> 18:28.580
It's... it's not just that.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.180
Why are you being so nice to me?

18:31.260 --> 18:32.260
What?

18:34.380 --> 18:35.660
Look.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.100
They're getting back at Sid
for everything he did to them.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.580
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

19:34.420 --> 19:37.900
Now that Hayley's gone,
we got to get rid of her brother.

19:39.860 --> 19:40.900
Working on it.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.780
Work faster.
