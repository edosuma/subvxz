Hi, Chris.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.403
How'd you do on
your science test?

00:38.405 --> 00:39.404
I got a "D."

00:39.406 --> 00:41.106
A "D"? That's fantastic!

00:41.108 --> 00:43.108
Just kiddin'.
I know it means you suck.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.310
Come here,
you delightful idiot.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.177
Another "D," Chris?

00:46.179 --> 00:49.047
I'm sorry, Mom,
but science is so hard.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.149
Well, maybe you just need
a little extra help.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.917
Dad, would you help me
with my homework?

00:52.919 --> 00:55.120
Uh, Chris, I've got to
tell you, that sounds worse

00:55.122 --> 00:57.656
than a trip to
a failing mall.

00:58.057 --> 00:58.923
All right, kids,
your mom is

00:58.925 --> 01:00.959
going to go to the Cinnabon
that has the cage

01:00.961 --> 01:02.093
pulled halfway down,
and I'm going to go

01:02.095 --> 01:04.996
to the stereo store next
to the dead fountain
with garbage in it.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.899
Let's say we meet back here
under the glue outline

01:07.901 --> 01:09.234
of the old Limited sign.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.835
Well, it doesn't
matter anyway.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.038
Every time I try to study,
the evil monkey

01:13.040 --> 01:15.907
comes out of my closet
and scares me.

01:19.045 --> 01:22.080
Oh, for God's sake, Chris,
you're in high school now.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.349
Stop talking about
that evil monkey.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.417
He's not real.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.885
He is too real!

01:26.887 --> 01:27.485
I can prove it!

01:27.487 --> 01:29.054
Well, you'll have to
do a better job

01:29.056 --> 01:30.355
than you did on
your science test.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.257
Or than God did
when he left the iron

01:32.259 --> 01:34.926
on Ellen Barkin's
face too long.

01:36.262 --> 01:36.995
Oh, damn.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.129
How is it?
You know what?

01:38.131 --> 01:40.165
We'll put you in the '80s.
You'll pass for hot.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.434
Now get in the van
with Kelly McGillis.

01:43.536 --> 01:46.438
Next stop: Hollywood!

01:46.440 --> 01:49.174
(braying)

01:51.577 --> 01:54.345
TV ANNOUNCER:
Up next, the <i>Hannah Montana</i>
<i>marathon.</i>

01:54.347 --> 01:56.081
Yes!
And for all you fans,

01:56.083 --> 01:59.384
the Miley Cyrus tour is coming
to the Quahog Civic Center

01:59.386 --> 02:00.485
for three nights only.

02:00.487 --> 02:01.986
Call to get your tickets now!

02:01.988 --> 02:04.089
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

02:04.091 --> 02:05.890
But not now,
'cause it just sold out.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.992
What? Oh, no! No!
No, no! No!

02:07.994 --> 02:08.727
I'm calling anyway!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.995
I need Hannah Montana tickets
and I need them now!

02:10.997 --> 02:13.531
Never mind who this is!
Can you get them or not?

02:13.533 --> 02:15.366
I guess I should dial
something first.

02:15.368 --> 02:17.802
What's all the noise?
What are you watching?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.404
Sorry, but you
know the rules.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.272
Hannah can't do
the photo shoot

02:21.274 --> 02:23.408
until Miley
finishes her homework.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.143
You can't tell
Hannah what to do.

02:25.145 --> 02:25.977
She's not your daughter.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.214
Wait, so Miley's my daughter,
but Hannah isn't?

02:29.216 --> 02:31.149
Right.
Great.

02:31.151 --> 02:31.950
Put your wig on.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.318
(audience laughter sound effect)

02:33.320 --> 02:35.253
Shut up!
This is real.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.089
Ha! You're watching
<i>Hannah Montana?</i>

02:38.091 --> 02:39.824
Well, yeah.
To make fun of it.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.360
I mean, look how stupid
she is with her clothes

02:42.362 --> 02:44.829
and her makeup
and, and-and, and,

02:44.831 --> 02:46.564
and that fabulous hair
and, oh, my God!

02:46.566 --> 02:49.501
Brian, it's my favorite show!
It's my favorite show ever!

02:49.503 --> 02:50.969
Gay.
And she's coming to town

02:50.971 --> 02:52.103
and I have to get
tickets, Brian.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.671
You have to help me
get tickets!
No.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.207
It's a stupid show
and a huge waste of time.

02:56.209 --> 03:00.111
(voice breaking):
But... she's my favorite.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.280
Oh, my God, are you...
are you crying?

03:02.282 --> 03:05.116
(crying): Yes!
Hannah Montana is my hero!

03:05.118 --> 03:06.050
I love her so, so much.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.419
And this is the only time
she's gonna be in town

03:08.421 --> 03:10.522
and now I'll never
get to see her!

03:10.524 --> 03:12.123
Will you help me?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.492
(sighs)
All right, fine.

03:18.164 --> 03:18.563
Hey, Chris.

03:18.565 --> 03:21.065
You want to practice
kissing again?
I'm busy.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.568
I set up a video camera
last night so I can prove

03:23.570 --> 03:26.070
to Mom and Dad that
the evil monkey is real,

03:26.072 --> 03:28.239
and I want to see
what I got.

03:44.423 --> 03:46.558
(tape squeals
while fast-forwarding)

03:59.038 --> 04:01.306
(fast-forwarding)

04:04.977 --> 04:06.511
Huh. Nothin'.

04:06.513 --> 04:10.348
All right, it's time
to play rough.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.071
I got you, you bastard!

04:34.807 --> 04:37.108
Well, here he is.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.910
The evil monkey!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.578
Do you believe me now?!

04:40.580 --> 04:42.113
Holy crap!

04:42.115 --> 04:42.547
It is real!

04:42.549 --> 04:45.483
Oh, my God!
I thought I was the only one.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.518
Meg, we're do--
we're doin'...

04:47.520 --> 04:49.988
We're doin'
Chris's monkey.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.428
Oh, my God,
Chris was right!

04:57.430 --> 05:00.098
Holy crap, Chris,
is that thing dangerous?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.699
Yes, he's evil!

05:01.701 --> 05:03.167
I'm not really evil.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.135
(gasps)
It talks!

05:04.137 --> 05:05.737
If-If someone will
please untie me,

05:05.739 --> 05:07.171
I'll explain everything.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.740
No, Dad,
don't do it!

05:08.742 --> 05:10.008
He's evil!

05:10.010 --> 05:10.708
Look, just trust me.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.343
This is all a huge
misunderstanding.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.980
Chris, I think we
should give him a chance
to explain himself.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.415
No!

05:18.284 --> 05:20.218
(sighs)
Thank you very much.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.452
Now, I know this looks bad,

05:21.454 --> 05:23.321
me living in your
son's closet and all,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.423
but it's a very
complex situation.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.126
You see, basically, I got home
from work one day,

05:28.128 --> 05:31.262
and found my wife cheating on me
with another monkey.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.430
Oh, that's terrible.

05:32.432 --> 05:35.266
I fell into a deep depression
after the divorce,

05:35.268 --> 05:36.534
which ended up
costing me my job.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.270
All my money was gone,
which means I lost the house.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.538
So, I moved into
Chris's closet,

05:40.540 --> 05:42.373
just until I got
back on my feet again.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.976
Wound up living in there
for nine years.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.512
Oh, my God,
you've missed so much!

05:47.514 --> 05:49.013
Like when America
was attacked

05:49.015 --> 05:51.582
by mentally challenged
suicide bombers.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.584
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

05:54.853 --> 05:55.820
You know something?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.755
You're not evil
at all, are you?

05:57.757 --> 05:58.489
No, he's not.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.359
He's just a poor fellow
who's down on his luck.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.226
Easy for you to say!

06:02.228 --> 06:05.129
He doesn't hide in your
closet making a scary face!

06:05.131 --> 06:06.931
That's just the face
I make when I'm thinking.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.466
And you're always
pointing at me!

06:08.468 --> 06:10.234
I was trying to start
a conversation.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.236
And you do that weird
trembling thing!

06:12.238 --> 06:13.104
I have a copper deficiency.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.106
Look, Chris, I'm sorry
if I scared you before,

06:15.108 --> 06:18.176
but this is a great chance
for us to start over.

06:18.178 --> 06:18.710
No, it isn't!

06:18.712 --> 06:22.146
You can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me!

06:22.148 --> 06:23.581
You go to hell!

06:38.130 --> 06:41.632
(indistinct conversations)

06:47.339 --> 06:48.339
(gasps)

06:48.341 --> 06:50.541
(indistinct conversation)

06:50.543 --> 06:52.510
Okay, now remember
to play it cool.

06:52.512 --> 06:53.778
Act like you belong here.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.214
Oh, my God, Miley!
I love you! I love you!

06:56.216 --> 06:57.415
I love you!
I'm your biggest fan!

06:57.417 --> 06:59.417
Can I touch your hair?!
(screams)

06:59.419 --> 07:00.318
Who are you guys?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.386
How did you get back here?

07:01.388 --> 07:02.920
Look, I'm really
sorry about this.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.855
This is my friend Stewie.

07:03.857 --> 07:08.192
H-He's just a baby and
he's your biggest fan and...

07:08.194 --> 07:09.293
he has cancer.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.628
Oh, my God! Really?

07:10.630 --> 07:12.196
Yeah, he's got
a tumor in his head

07:12.198 --> 07:15.166
the size of a football.
I think I can see it.

07:15.168 --> 07:15.800
Well, in that case,

07:15.802 --> 07:18.136
I wouldn't feel right
about throwing you out.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.471
Especially if you're
my biggest fan.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.440
(shudders happily)

07:24.243 --> 07:27.245
I mean, Sarah Silverman
is just one of the most

07:27.247 --> 07:28.946
wonderful people
you'll ever meet.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.515
Oh, that's so
good to hear.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.750
I want to like her.
She's so funny.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.185
I want her
to also be nice.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.321
Well, I'm glad you guys are
having such a great time

07:37.323 --> 07:39.891
with that evil thing
that tortured me for years!

07:39.893 --> 07:43.461
Dad, I thought you
were going to help me
with my book report.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.463
Chris, there is
a monkey here.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.832
And I just fed him a whole
bag of Subway sandwiches.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.901
In a couple hours,
we are going to sit around

07:49.903 --> 07:52.303
and throw his soft bread stool
at each other.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.872
Now, you are welcome
to be a part of that.

07:54.874 --> 07:55.540
Or not.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.809
I'm just telling you
what's gonna happen.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.145
Well, thanks for
nothing, Dad!

08:01.980 --> 08:02.980
Don't mind him, monkey.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.682
He's just a big
disappointment.

08:04.684 --> 08:08.319
Like things that look
like DVDs from far away.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.654
(gasps):
DVDs!

08:09.656 --> 08:11.289
Aw, books.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.871
(keys clacking)

08:29.675 --> 08:31.576
(scratching)

08:31.578 --> 08:33.911
Ah... that feels so good.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.580
You are an artist.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.447
Thank you.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.349
Lois doesn't like
my toenails

08:38.351 --> 08:40.551
'cause they stab her
in the night.

08:40.553 --> 08:41.619
Hear that, Lois?

08:41.621 --> 08:43.588
Somebody likes my toenails.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.722
Good for you, Peter.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.557
Good for this family.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.426
Good for all of us.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.327
Mom! Dad!

08:49.329 --> 08:51.562
I got an "A"
on my book report!

08:51.564 --> 08:52.630
That's wonderful, honey!

08:52.632 --> 08:55.633
Congratulations, Chris.
What'd you write about?

08:55.635 --> 08:56.400
I, um...

08:56.402 --> 08:59.637
"The Slave Trade Allegory
of <i>Curious George."</i>

08:59.639 --> 09:02.507
W-Wait a minute, I didn't--
I didn't write this.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.608
Oh, really?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.543
Did... Did you
write this?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.978
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.547
I've been listening
to you talk in your
sleep for years,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.649
so I just put your
thoughts on paper,
that's all.

09:11.651 --> 09:15.786
Wow, that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.756
Thanks, evil monk--
thanks, monkey.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.259
Ah, I'd get up to hug you,
but sittin' down's

09:21.261 --> 09:22.960
the only thing
keepin' the poop in.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.629
Nah, that's okay.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.734
I can't believe
I'm sitting here

09:29.736 --> 09:30.968
with you, Miley Cyrus.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.470
It's like I'm in a dream.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.405
Well, that makes
me happy, Stewie.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.373
What are you doing?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.041
Oh, I'm just writing
some new lyrics.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.676
Oh, you write
your own lyrics?

09:38.678 --> 09:41.546
Yeah.
So do I...

09:41.548 --> 09:43.614
Oh, you wrote a song?

09:43.616 --> 09:44.282
Look at you.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.050
You're a regular
little Tim McGraw.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.286
(chuckling):
Oh, oh, I'm...

09:48.288 --> 09:50.655
I'm-I'm a little better
than Tim McGraw.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.658
Hey, these are
pretty good, Stewie.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.325
Really?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.860
Do you think you
could sing them?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.461
Only if you sing with me.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.030
(squealing):

11:09.501 --> 11:10.668
Hey, where you guys been?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.536
We went to the
father/son barbecue.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.039
You drove all the way up
to Fatherson for a barbecue?

11:15.041 --> 11:18.476
No, Dad, it was a barbecue
for fathers and sons.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.578
Wait a minute--
you went with the monkey

11:20.580 --> 11:21.579
to a father/son thing?

11:21.581 --> 11:23.848
Well, it's not like you ever
take me anywhere.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.783
What?
Oh, listen,
Peter, I didn't...

11:25.785 --> 11:27.585
Meg, please!
It's true.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.819
You never want to do
anything with me!

11:28.821 --> 11:32.023
But the monkey's been taking me
to all the fun places I like,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.625
and he's been helping me
with all my homework!

11:34.627 --> 11:37.161
He helped me get
an "A" in algebra!

11:37.163 --> 11:39.997
How did the monkey know you
needed help with algebra?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.466
Because he asked!

11:43.135 --> 11:44.001
That's right, Dad.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.671
You never ask,
and even if you did,

11:46.673 --> 11:47.605
you never listen!

11:47.607 --> 11:49.607
And now you're getting
mad at the monkey

11:49.609 --> 11:51.642
because he actually cares?

11:51.644 --> 11:52.677
Screw you!

11:52.679 --> 11:56.514
You are the worst dad
in the world and I hate you!

11:56.516 --> 11:59.450
Well... Well,
I hate you, too!

12:00.118 --> 12:00.718
Ah, damn.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.587
I left my cell phone up
at that monkey/kid barbecue.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.589
I thought you said it was
a father/son barbecue.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.192
Yeah, but it was up
in Monkeykid.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.460
What?!

12:21.973 --> 12:24.675
Boy, you guys have been
awful quiet this morning.

12:24.677 --> 12:28.212
Lois, could you ask Chris
to pass the maple syrup?

12:28.214 --> 12:29.747
Meg, could you
tell Dad

12:29.749 --> 12:31.782
that he's too fat
to need extra syrup?

12:31.784 --> 12:33.884
Lois, could you tell Chris
that I'm sorry

12:33.886 --> 12:37.121
I ever planted the seed version
of him in your vagina?

12:37.123 --> 12:38.556
I want you two
to stop this.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.725
This is no way for
a father and son to act.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.560
Well, according to him,
that stupid monkey's

12:42.562 --> 12:44.528
more of a father
to him than I am.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.864
He makes time for me
and you never do.

12:46.866 --> 12:50.468
You're supposed to love me
and all you do is hurt me.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.570
This morning I had
a hard poo that hurt,

12:52.572 --> 12:53.304
but then it felt great.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.239
Meg, I'm trying to be
mad right now,

12:55.241 --> 12:57.675
but that's making
me want to smile.

13:02.013 --> 13:05.683
(laughing)
This'll get Chris.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.851
Hey, classmates.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.152
Griffin.
Did you gain weight?

13:08.154 --> 13:09.587
Eh, that's
not important.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.088
But you know
what is important?

13:11.090 --> 13:11.989
I'm gay now.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.725
Let's all of us go be
gay somewhere together.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.160
And then you go
tell all your friends

13:16.162 --> 13:19.096
that I welcome them
to be gay with me, too.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.198
Because I am gay.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.666
I'll be gay with you.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.502
Oh, this is too perfect.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.872
Chris is going to be
so gay by the end of this.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.209
What's this?

13:32.211 --> 13:35.780
"Put your head between
these two restrained logs

13:35.782 --> 13:37.848
and win a free hat"?

13:38.617 --> 13:40.017
Well, that's a no-brainer.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.620
Come on, you fat (bleep).

13:42.622 --> 13:43.888
Do it.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.225
(screaming)

13:48.227 --> 13:50.594
(laughing)

13:51.930 --> 13:53.297
Who's laughing now?

13:53.299 --> 13:56.133
I got my hat.

13:59.304 --> 14:01.038
Hey, guys.
I stopped at Pinkberry

14:01.040 --> 14:02.606
and I got some
for everybody.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.041
Wow, thanks.
You're welcome.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.277
I've got to go put on my
face for press interviews.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.547
Stewie, can you hand
me my cell phone?
Oh, sure.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.948
(static crackles)

14:10.950 --> 14:12.383
Thanks!

14:12.385 --> 14:13.884
That was weird--
did you hear that

14:13.886 --> 14:14.985
when I was giving
her the phone?

14:14.987 --> 14:18.789
No.
It was like,
interference or something.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.158
Wait a second.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.067
(both gasp)

14:33.905 --> 14:35.706
Oh, my God!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.041
She's an android!

14:37.043 --> 14:39.210
Miley Cyrus is an android!

14:39.212 --> 14:39.944
Of course.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.112
She's a product
of Disney Imagineering.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.348
They built a perfect
robot teen idol.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.884
Yes, assuring that
she could never fail.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.752
Like famous duelist
Sir Henry

14:48.754 --> 14:51.722
"Giant-Hole-In-The-Torso"
Wickenshire.

14:53.058 --> 14:53.824
(gunshot)

14:53.826 --> 14:54.892
Aha!
Right through me!

14:54.894 --> 14:57.862
Prepare for returned fire,
Sir Joseph Broadfront.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.598
I give you one last
chance to rescind

15:00.600 --> 15:03.634
your insult of calling
me a "common dandy."

15:03.636 --> 15:05.736
Never!

15:07.272 --> 15:09.206
♪

15:09.741 --> 15:12.276
My God, I can't believe
she's an android.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.212
Do you think we should
tell someone or do something?

15:15.214 --> 15:16.847
Well, we could
do something.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.948
Like what?
Well, look at her.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.852
She dances like a real girl.
She moves like a real girl.

15:21.854 --> 15:22.386
Yeah?

15:22.388 --> 15:24.989
Do you think she
does other stuff
like a real girl?

15:24.991 --> 15:26.423
You know, if you
reprogrammed her?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.826
Brian, that's sick!
She's 16!

15:28.828 --> 15:29.460
I'm eight.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.062
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

15:33.131 --> 15:34.131
Hey, Miley.

15:34.133 --> 15:34.999
Oh, hi, Stewie.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.034
Hey, um, your shirt
tag is showing.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.869
Let me just, uh...

15:40.872 --> 15:42.773
There we go, all done.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.808
(electricity crackling)

15:44.810 --> 15:46.210
Um...

15:47.078 --> 15:49.747
Miley smash!

15:49.749 --> 15:51.148
(roaring)

15:51.150 --> 15:52.816
Uh-oh...
hang on, hang on.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.585
Maybe I can fix this.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.921
(growling)

15:56.923 --> 15:58.656
Run!

16:00.258 --> 16:02.126
Monkey, do you think
you could help me?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.928
I just can't stand
Peter and Chris

16:03.930 --> 16:05.396
being at each other's
throats anymore.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.765
Of course, Lois;
I'm sure if we can just

16:07.767 --> 16:09.099
get them in the same
room together,

16:09.101 --> 16:10.734
I can convince them
to talk it out.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.002
Why don't you invite
Peter to lunch,

16:12.004 --> 16:14.471
and I'll invite Chris,
and we'll see what we can do.

16:14.473 --> 16:18.309
Oh, thank you.
I really appreciate it.

16:23.214 --> 16:24.815
What the hell
are you doing here?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.050
I thought I was
meeting Lois.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.451
She wanted me to
talk to you guys

16:27.453 --> 16:28.986
about the way
you've been behaving.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.121
Look, monkey, Chris is
being a jerk, all right?

16:31.123 --> 16:32.623
And there is
nothing you can say

16:32.625 --> 16:34.491
that will make me
change my mind about that.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.260
Peter, you're
acting bananas.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.561
(laughs)
All right, I'll listen.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.464
You're both good guys
and that's why it's important

16:40.466 --> 16:42.333
for you to reconcile
your differences.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.134
Chris, I know you're angry,

16:44.136 --> 16:45.936
but do you really
hate your father?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.973
No, I just think
he's a douche.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.074
Sometimes he is.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.710
And Peter, do you
really hate your son?

16:52.712 --> 16:55.846
No, but sometimes he's
such a little fat jerk.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.983
Well, it's only because you
never have any time for me!

16:58.985 --> 17:00.351
Peter, do you think
you could make

17:00.353 --> 17:02.686
a little more time
for your son?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.288
Yeah, I guess so.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.890
(Stewie & Brian screaming)

17:06.892 --> 17:08.559
What the hell
was that about?

17:08.561 --> 17:11.028
Was that Stewie
and Brian?

17:12.063 --> 17:14.298
(people screaming)

17:14.300 --> 17:15.866
(explosion)

17:16.735 --> 17:18.902
(roaring)

17:25.276 --> 17:27.277
(roars)

17:27.279 --> 17:29.046
(gasps)
It's Miley Cyrus!

17:29.048 --> 17:31.248
And she's
destroying the city!

17:31.250 --> 17:33.150
Oh, my God!

17:33.284 --> 17:35.719
Ms. Cyrus, I ask you
to stop what you're doing.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.721
I don't just mean this,
I mean everything:

17:37.723 --> 17:41.258
the show, the music--
it's all just awful.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.794
(roaring)

17:43.796 --> 17:45.696
(monkey screams)

17:49.200 --> 17:51.201
Dad, we've got
to help him!

17:51.203 --> 17:52.102
Do something!

17:52.104 --> 17:53.103
What am I supposed to do?!

17:53.105 --> 17:56.373
You're my dad!
Think of something!

18:00.879 --> 18:03.347
Quagmire, fire up
the biplane.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.183
My son needs my help.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.263
(roaring)

18:25.503 --> 18:27.204
All right, Peter,
we're closing in.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.906
Get ready to fire.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.142
(laughs along with
gun firing)

18:32.144 --> 18:35.179
(giggitys along with
gun firing)

18:37.849 --> 18:40.217
(roaring)

18:46.324 --> 18:48.025
(roaring)

18:51.830 --> 18:54.431
(roars)

19:10.115 --> 19:12.216
(guns firing)

19:25.196 --> 19:27.231
(roaring)

19:40.211 --> 19:42.346
(roaring)

19:45.350 --> 19:47.918
Monkey! Grab my hand!

20:14.345 --> 20:15.813
Well, the airplane got her.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.015
Oh, no, it wasn't the airplane.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.285
'Twas beauty
killed the beast.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.220
You know, Brian,
here's your shot.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.855
Go for it.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.457
Oop, too late.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.159
No, it's not.

20:32.263 --> 20:33.397
Thanks for everything,
monkey.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.400
You made me realize how much
Chris really means to me

20:36.402 --> 20:40.204
and how I should always remember
not to take him for granted.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.005
Well, sometimes
all anybody needs

20:42.007 --> 20:43.407
is a little bit
of a wake-up call.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.843
And now that you two
are getting along again,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.010
my work here is done.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.979
Guess I'll be
moving on now.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.113
You have to leave?

20:50.115 --> 20:51.481
But I thought
you were gonna go

20:51.483 --> 20:53.183
back to living
in my closet again.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.619
I think that time of
my life is over, Chris.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.554
But I'll always remember you.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.459
But... where will you go?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.928
I'll go where I'm needed.

21:10.401 --> 21:13.237
Dad, there's an evil
