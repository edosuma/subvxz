WEBVTT

00:41.458 --> 00:46.666
I'm bored,
I'm hot, and I'm starving.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.458
I told you to preserve your rations.

00:49.458 --> 00:52.416
Well... [sighs] ...I got hungry.

00:54.958 --> 00:56.958
We're wasting our time.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.125
This skiff's a heap of junk.

00:59.791 --> 01:04.625
Yes, but with a few repairs, it'll be
a slightly operational heap of junk.

01:04.625 --> 01:07.416
The energy cells have just enough power
to get us to the town

01:07.416 --> 01:09.791
on the other half of the hemisphere.

01:09.791 --> 01:10.875
Power?

01:12.208 --> 01:15.333
We forgot about Gonky.
He's still on the <i>Marauder</i>.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.500
I'm afraid since the thief
disabled the ship's transponder,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.375
we will not be able to locate him.

01:20.375 --> 01:23.250
Not the ship. I mean we can track Gonky.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.125
Oh. Ingenious idea.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.583
Try doing a trace
on his binary reference code.

01:28.583 --> 01:29.500
On it.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.916
Don't get your hopes up, kid.

01:49.916 --> 01:52.625
Shut it, already. I'm getting annoyed.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.208
Mokko, it's Benni.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.208
<i>You're late, kid.</i>

02:04.208 --> 02:08.083
My scouting run took longer than expected,
but I found something you're gonna like.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.166
Lower the shield.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.750
What?

02:41.750 --> 02:42.833
Oh!

02:44.333 --> 02:45.541
Is that--

03:07.041 --> 03:08.375
Hmm.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.375
You said you had something for me, Benni.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.041
Didn't expect this.

03:17.041 --> 03:20.000
I swiped it from some amateurs
poking around the old mines

03:20.000 --> 03:21.250
in the northern territory.

03:25.083 --> 03:28.333
Miners don't travel in ships like this.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.541
Looks specially modified.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.750
This could draw
the wrong kind of attention.

03:36.958 --> 03:42.083
Are you trying to cause problems for me,
after I've been so good to you?

03:42.083 --> 03:43.583
No, Mokko. Honest.

03:43.583 --> 03:47.375
I-I thought you could make some money
off of it. That's all. I-I swear.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.333
Yeah.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.041
All right. I believe you.

03:52.041 --> 03:56.208
But I'll have to sell it off
piece by piece just to be safe.

03:56.208 --> 04:00.375
This'll still put me in contention
for top earner this round, right?

04:01.125 --> 04:03.583
We'll have to see, Benni.
We'll have to see.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.250
But you did good.

04:08.833 --> 04:13.500
As a show of my gratitude,
you can keep the droid.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.291
What about water rations?

04:16.083 --> 04:18.583
I was scouting out there
for four rotations.

04:19.666 --> 04:20.916
Right you are.

04:36.666 --> 04:39.250
Mokko always takes care of his crew.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.958
Strip the ship of anything useful.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.625
Ooh, yeah!

04:43.625 --> 04:44.541
Whoo!

04:44.541 --> 04:45.875
Thanks, Mokko.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.041
Of course. Of course.

05:05.416 --> 05:07.166
I'm getting a reading.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.791
I think I found Gonky!

05:09.791 --> 05:12.000
You-- What?

05:12.625 --> 05:13.750
You found him?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.916
His signal is 100 kilometers east.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.666
If Gonky's still on the planet,
the <i>Marauder</i> must be too.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.166
Let's get this thing running and find out.

05:35.708 --> 05:37.916
Gonky's signal is pinging from down there.

05:38.416 --> 05:41.000
I'm reading minimal life-forms
in his proximity

05:41.000 --> 05:43.791
but an unknown number
in the subterranean level.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.333
This place looks worse
than the abandoned spaceport.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.375
We'll do a split approach.
Stay alert.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.208
Guess I'll have to sell you for parts.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.416
Because you're useless to me.

06:04.416 --> 06:06.875
What am I gonna do
with a defective power droid?

06:07.875 --> 06:10.583
That's our defective power droid.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.083
Now, where's our ship?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.875
Oh.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.041
You see, the thing is--

06:37.166 --> 06:39.875
Hey, Gonky, you okay?

06:41.291 --> 06:43.458
What do you care how that thing's doing?

06:43.458 --> 06:45.291
It's just a beat-up old battery.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.875
Not to us.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.750
Let's try that again.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.541
Where's our ship?

06:52.541 --> 06:55.500
Can you be more specific?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.125
The one you stole yesterday.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.916
Oh, right. That ship.

07:00.916 --> 07:02.166
Well, Mokko has it.

07:02.666 --> 07:04.416
He gave me the droid as a gift.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.875
And who is this Mokko?

07:08.708 --> 07:09.708
Who's Mokko?

07:10.333 --> 07:12.958
He runs this whole town. He's the boss.

07:13.583 --> 07:14.916
Your ship's his now.

07:14.916 --> 07:16.875
Yeah, we'll see about that.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.083
Take us to it.

07:19.583 --> 07:20.666
No way.

07:20.666 --> 07:23.000
I can't help you go against Mokko.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.791
You don't know what he's done for me.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.666
All right, all right.

07:27.666 --> 07:29.625
I can show you where your ship is.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.291
But if you get caught, you don't know me.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.083
Techno Union ran this mine during the war,

07:40.083 --> 07:42.500
but Mokko took over
when they were forced out.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.250
He's kept this operation running
ever since.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.791
So, you're an ipsium miner
and a ship thief?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.250
Mokko says they're useful skills.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.250
Stealing's not a skill.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.041
It is when you're good at it.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.041
The central portal is ray-shielded,

07:59.041 --> 08:02.916
and all subterranean entrances appear
to be guarded in shifts.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.750
Ah, we've stormed
tougher strongholds than that.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.791
You can't use blasters
inside an ipsium mine.

08:08.791 --> 08:11.208
You'll destroy everything
and everyone in there.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.625
Cut your losses now.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.916
There is one covert infiltration point.

08:17.416 --> 08:18.250
From there.

08:22.666 --> 08:25.375
The stack has a lower access hatch inside.

08:25.375 --> 08:29.541
If timed correctly,
we can rappel down between exhaust cycles.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.541
How big of a window is there?

08:33.125 --> 08:34.125
Sixty seconds.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.208
Plenty of time.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.541
Glad you're all so confident,

08:37.541 --> 08:40.208
but getting cooked alive
wasn't on my agenda.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.708
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.

08:43.291 --> 08:46.166
You can go once we have our ship back.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.000
Oh, boy.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.833
Uh, uh-uh.

09:10.916 --> 09:11.916
Set.

09:11.916 --> 09:13.000
On my mark.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.958
This is a very bad idea.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.166
Now.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.125
You said it was unguarded.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.458
It was at the time.

09:44.916 --> 09:46.000
Thirty seconds.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.291
He's not gonna make it.

09:47.791 --> 09:50.375
I'm telling you.
You gotta bail before it's too late.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.500
We don't do that.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.916
This is not good. This is not good.

09:57.125 --> 09:59.125
<i>Hunter, you have to move.</i>

10:10.000 --> 10:11.208
Five seconds.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.458
All clear.

10:29.916 --> 10:32.000
You definitely aren't ipsium miners.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.083
Nope.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.541
You stole the wrong ship.

10:39.916 --> 10:40.916
Let's move.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.250
Shh.

11:11.916 --> 11:15.208
The conditions of this mine
are less than ideal.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.833
It's because the ipsium's become degraded.

11:18.375 --> 11:21.666
Mokko had to lower wages
just to keep this mine up and running.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.583
At least we're still working.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.583
Your ship's in the upper garage bay
across from the central tower.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.958
Come on. I know a shortcut.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.583
No tricks.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.541
Hey, I'm not trying to get caught either.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.000
Well, there's your ship.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
I held up my end of the bargain,
so I'll be off.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.083
Hang on.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.166
The hyperdrive has been removed.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.750
You didn't ask me
what condition it'd be in.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.833
How's that my fault?

12:14.250 --> 12:17.041
Relax. It's not a complicated fix.

12:17.041 --> 12:18.875
It better not be.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.541
Grab the hyperdrive.
Let's make this quick.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.458
What about the ray shield?

12:23.458 --> 12:25.125
We still need to shut it down.

12:25.791 --> 12:28.000
You can only do that
from the central tower.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.041
- Let's go.
- No way.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.625
You stick out too much.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.708
If you don't trust me to go alone,
she'll blend in easily enough.

12:37.833 --> 12:38.833
Hmm.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.833
Well, don't let him out of your sight.

12:41.833 --> 12:45.625
Transfer the data onto this,
and I can access the shield remotely.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.125
Let's go.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.250
Not looking like that.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.416
They can wait till I'm good and ready.

13:22.916 --> 13:25.250
You said the control room's
on the top level.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.833
We can't just walk right in.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.708
Only Mokko's inner circle
has access cards.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.375
We'll need to swipe one.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.416
You're not part of his inner circle?

13:33.416 --> 13:35.500
Not yet, but I will be.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.791
I'm working my way up.

13:37.791 --> 13:42.125
But if Mokko finds out I helped you,
I'll be sent to the mines, so act natural.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.500
We were just talking about you, Benni.
Where you been?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Here and there.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.916
Bet you think
the ship you scored for Mokko

14:05.916 --> 14:08.166
will make you the top earner this round?

14:08.666 --> 14:10.041
Why not?

14:10.041 --> 14:11.916
You can't expect to win every time.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.125
Can't I?

14:23.833 --> 14:25.375
That's Mokko.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.041
About time. I'm starving!

14:33.166 --> 14:35.083
See, it's a skill.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.625
Great, can we go now?

14:37.125 --> 14:39.250
Not yet. I wanna hear the tally.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.291
All right, all right.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.458
Stand sharp.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.583
I know it's been a lean season.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.791
We've all had to make sacrifices
and go without.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.458
Including me.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.458
While some of you have been
working hard this quarter,

14:57.958 --> 15:00.666
others continue to fall short.

15:01.833 --> 15:06.000
But Mokko always takes care of
those who earn.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.833
And, so far, this round's top earner is...

15:11.416 --> 15:12.416
Drake!

15:15.708 --> 15:17.875
You've gotta be kidding me.

15:25.916 --> 15:30.166
As for the rest of you,
rations are low.

15:30.166 --> 15:36.791
Which means you need to work harder
and longer if we're going to survive.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.875
But I won't let my crew starve.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.375
Hey! Watch it!

16:04.541 --> 16:05.583
How's it looking?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.375
I can get most of the systems
back online easily enough,

16:08.375 --> 16:12.333
<i>but we are not going anywhere
until we get the hyperdrive connected.</i>

16:12.333 --> 16:14.291
I'm working on it!

16:17.708 --> 16:19.625
Uh, you all right?

16:20.125 --> 16:21.125
No.

16:21.125 --> 16:25.000
I stole the ship, and it still didn't
make me the top earner.

16:25.541 --> 16:27.833
You shouldn't have to compete for food.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.666
That's how it works here.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.333
We have to earn our share.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.750
But I'll impress Mokko. Just wait.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.000
Hunter, we've reached the control room.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.250
<i>Copy that.
Get the shield code and get back here.</i>

17:24.375 --> 17:26.708
They really treat you
like you're one of them.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.250
I wish Mokko did that.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.208
Doesn't seem like he cares,
about any of you.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.166
Why don't you leave?

17:37.166 --> 17:38.666
You're wrong.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.541
Mokko's kept us in business.

17:41.541 --> 17:45.708
He said with more time and more digging,
we're bound to reach better ipsium soon.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.916
Besides, I can't leave.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.833
This is my home. It's what I know.

17:53.541 --> 17:54.916
I get it.

17:54.916 --> 17:58.125
Our ship is our home.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.708
It's the only one we really have.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.833
I'm, uh, sorry I stole it.

18:06.875 --> 18:10.083
Here, you can have my rations.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.875
I-- Why would you give this to me?

18:14.541 --> 18:15.541
For helping us.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.125
Thanks.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.083
The motivator is installed,

18:46.083 --> 18:49.083
but I still have to connect the primaries
to the guidance system

18:49.083 --> 18:50.833
and adjust the navicomputer.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.416
The weapons system's online.

18:52.416 --> 18:53.958
We're not engaging.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.375
The situation for these kids
is bad enough.

18:57.083 --> 19:01.708
Mokko appears to be using his power
and means as leverage over his workers.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.666
It is a similar tactic used by the Empire.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.458
Although, this operation is
on a smaller scale.

19:17.708 --> 19:20.583
Didn't Bryce and Hugh say
they removed the hyperdrive?

19:21.541 --> 19:23.166
Hey, who are you?

19:23.666 --> 19:26.458
Uh, Mokko sent us.

19:29.041 --> 19:30.125
Easy.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.416
We're just here for our ship.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.958
Get the engines online.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.500
Any luck with the shield code?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Not yet.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.083
Most of this data is
just Mokko's profit reports.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.083
I thought you said
the ipsium here's degraded.

19:52.583 --> 19:53.708
It is.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.625
Not according to this.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.041
Let me see that.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.166
Mmm.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.875
My thief caught another thief.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.625
Nicely done, Benni.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.833
I'm impressed.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.666
Where are the others?

20:18.458 --> 20:19.458
Garage bay.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.625
Sorry. I had to.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.166
That's my boy.

20:26.875 --> 20:31.458
The title of top earner is definitely
in your future.

20:44.666 --> 20:47.083
<i>The hyperdrive is nearly online.</i>

20:47.083 --> 20:48.958
I lost our spies.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.750
And they called in backup.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.750
It appears we have uninvited guests.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.333
Care to show yourselves?

21:04.416 --> 21:07.250
So, you think you can come here
and steal from me?

21:08.125 --> 21:10.583
Technically, this ship belongs to us.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.166
Not anymore!

21:13.083 --> 21:15.875
And I'd rethink the blasters.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.833
One stray shot, and we're all done for.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.750
We don't miss.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.666
I believe you,
but I think you'll reconsider.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.291
No!

21:32.333 --> 21:36.500
Let go! Get off me!

21:40.416 --> 21:43.125
Lower your weapons, or she goes over.

21:58.958 --> 22:01.875
Trespassing and attempted theft.

22:02.458 --> 22:05.708
Ten years in the mines seems
like a reasonable punishment,

22:06.208 --> 22:07.750
if you survive that long.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.041
Take them below.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.333
Stop!

22:17.250 --> 22:19.416
Not now, kid. I'm busy.

22:20.375 --> 22:22.166
You lied to us, Mokko.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.333
The ipsium's not degrading!

22:24.833 --> 22:27.625
You've been cutting us out
and keeping the profits for yourself!

22:28.333 --> 22:31.083
That's a lie. Don't listen to him!

22:31.583 --> 22:33.791
You never cared about us at all.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.500
And I have the proof right here.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.208
Let me see that.

22:44.916 --> 22:47.208
What's going on, Mokko?

22:47.791 --> 22:51.541
We toil down in the mines
while you enjoy the spoils?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.541
I was taking my share!

22:57.541 --> 22:59.750
None of you would've survived without me!

22:59.750 --> 23:01.166
Don't forget that.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.958
Throw her over!

23:35.166 --> 23:37.708
No one's going to take
what belongs to me.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.083
Take care of all of them!

23:49.833 --> 23:51.416
I'll deal with you myself!

23:58.958 --> 24:00.125
Grab my hand!

24:03.166 --> 24:05.125
You never should've crossed me, kid.

24:33.375 --> 24:34.583
Good to have you back.

24:38.583 --> 24:39.958
Here's your stuff.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.250
All of it?

24:42.875 --> 24:44.875
Yeah, don't you trust me?

24:48.500 --> 24:51.125
Okay, that's fair. But it's all there.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.083
So, what will all of you do now?

24:56.791 --> 24:59.000
I guess we'll keep mining ipsium.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.708
It's what we know.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.541
You can be whatever you want.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.375
It's a big galaxy.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.708
You don't have to stay here.

25:06.708 --> 25:08.166
It's not so bad.

25:08.666 --> 25:10.333
And with Mokko gone,

25:11.041 --> 25:13.791
we'll all be getting an equal share
of the profits now.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.750
Benni, chow time!

25:19.083 --> 25:21.000
Thanks for showing me the truth.

25:21.791 --> 25:24.958
Hey, if you ever need a thief, I owe you.

25:30.166 --> 25:31.708
What is it?

25:32.375 --> 25:34.250
The Empire's not the only threat.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.583
We've seen so many
in the galaxy like Mokko.

25:39.375 --> 25:42.916
Unfortunately, yes.

25:44.083 --> 25:47.958
However, there are many like us
out there as well.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.791
And that is something.
