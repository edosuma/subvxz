WEBVTT

01:20.083 --> 01:21.541
Captain, where are you?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.041
I'm heading there with my sister's family.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.250
We're almost there, so hang on.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.166
Is this the right way?

01:32.458 --> 01:34.291
I drove through here dozens of times.

01:34.958 --> 01:36.791
All the other roads would be packed with cars.

01:44.166 --> 01:45.291
Oh...

01:48.500 --> 01:50.875
Please give us a ride.

01:51.625 --> 01:54.708
I have a little girl. I have a wife too.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.291
Please take us to the port.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.166
I'm begging you...

02:00.250 --> 02:02.666
I wasn't bitten! It's not a bite!

02:07.791 --> 02:11.333
If we look dangerous,
at least take our girl. Please.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.958
Sir?

02:13.666 --> 02:15.875
Please! I'm begging you!

02:16.625 --> 02:17.791
Sir! Please!

02:21.208 --> 02:22.375
Jung-seok...

02:23.916 --> 02:25.500
Don't say anything until we're on the ship!

02:33.000 --> 02:36.291
Can you tell us
why this dreadful virus has spread, Paul?

02:36.708 --> 02:39.125
Well, unfortunately, we don't have much information

02:39.333 --> 02:42.750
other than the fact that it started
out of a bio-factory in South Korea.

02:42.833 --> 02:47.541
Uh, it's unclear exactly
how this unidentified virus initially began to spread.

02:48.125 --> 02:51.375
Of course,
sheer pandemonium broke loose in South Korea.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.958
And many people began to believe a rumor

02:54.041 --> 02:55.375
that was circulating online

02:55.458 --> 02:57.708
about a safe region somewhere further down south...

02:57.791 --> 03:00.208
Busan? Is this the correct pronunciation?

03:00.291 --> 03:02.541
That's right. People were evacuated there.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.375
But in the end, no place was truly safe.

03:05.458 --> 03:09.166
But there is an absolute safe place
on the Korean Peninsula.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.208
That's correct.
I believe you're referring to North Korea.

03:12.791 --> 03:16.041
Perhaps it's fortunate
that this happened before the reunification!

03:16.125 --> 03:17.375
So it turns out.

03:17.708 --> 03:21.333
So how long before the Korean government
lost all control?

03:21.416 --> 03:22.958
Just one day.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.625
Please move slowly!

03:28.125 --> 03:29.958
This is Alpha One.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.125
Move on!

03:32.208 --> 03:33.208
Be careful!

03:47.166 --> 03:48.208
This is Alpha Two.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.125
We have about 50 civilians waiting for boarding.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.375
Uncle.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.291
Are you all right, Dong-hwan?

04:12.708 --> 04:13.708
Yes.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.375
Where's Chul-min?

04:15.791 --> 04:17.708
He went to get some relief aid.

04:18.666 --> 04:22.791
But shouldn't we have arrived in Japan by now?

04:23.750 --> 04:25.916
I'm sure we're almost there, don't worry.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.458
Captain!

04:32.208 --> 04:33.208
What is it?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.250
We're being rerouted to Hong Kong.

04:36.583 --> 04:37.583
Why all of sudden?

04:37.916 --> 04:39.416
They're not telling me why.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.166
I have to go check something.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.416
Excuse me.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.666
I'll ask about it,
so go and check what's going on.

05:01.750 --> 05:02.750
Yes, sir.

05:03.375 --> 05:04.416
Excuse me.

05:04.833 --> 05:05.833
Excuse me.

05:12.541 --> 05:13.541
Uh.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.625
Sir!

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Sir!

05:46.291 --> 05:48.416
Is it true that we are rerouting to Hong Kong?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.291
Please return to your seats.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.875
We need to understand the situation, sir!

05:53.750 --> 05:55.250
Everyone's getting nervous.

05:55.541 --> 05:58.916
Please return to your seat
and await further instructions.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.041
Sir!

06:00.166 --> 06:01.166
We have a problem.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.541
We've found an infected person
on the lower deck cabins.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.125
We get ramen too?

06:08.666 --> 06:10.375
Come in. Leave your bag here.

06:10.458 --> 06:11.458
It looks good.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.625
Please come in.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.416
- Infected!
- What?

06:19.083 --> 06:20.125
What is it?

07:15.541 --> 07:17.291
It's okay, I'll be right here.

07:17.791 --> 07:21.208
Breathe, Dong-hwan. I'm not going anywhere.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.875
It'll be okay.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.958
Look at me.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.833
I'll be right here with you.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.375
What do I do?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.541
Your uncle's here, Dong-hwan.

07:46.916 --> 07:47.916
Sis...

07:48.333 --> 07:50.291
- What do we do?
- We have to go.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.708
We have to go now, come on!

07:53.250 --> 07:55.041
- Let's go!
- Your uncle...

07:56.833 --> 07:57.875
We have to go!

07:59.166 --> 08:00.291
We must leave.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.375
Come on!

08:03.208 --> 08:04.250
Sis!

08:21.750 --> 08:23.958
Sis! Sis!

08:38.458 --> 08:39.500
Honey!

08:40.833 --> 08:41.833
No!

09:16.583 --> 09:19.083
There is even a case of infected hosts

09:19.166 --> 09:22.041
that were found on the last lifeboats
to leave for Hong Kong.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.791
After that, the neighboring countries

09:23.875 --> 09:27.041
decided to no longer accept any more refugees.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.833
In effect, Korea became completely quarantined.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.125
Yes, it's been four years already.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.916
Yes. Four years.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.000
Wake him up.

10:46.541 --> 10:49.000
Hey! Wake up!

10:53.458 --> 10:54.500
That's enough!

10:57.875 --> 10:59.416
We are not here to fight.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.250
The boss wants to see you.

11:04.416 --> 11:05.458
Hey!

11:40.333 --> 11:41.333
Come on.

11:49.541 --> 11:50.791
What are you doing here?

11:51.041 --> 11:52.041
Let's leave.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.125
Let go of me.

11:53.791 --> 11:54.791
Hyung!

11:54.916 --> 11:55.916
"Hyung."

11:57.958 --> 11:59.500
It means "brother," doesn't it?

11:59.708 --> 12:01.083
You two brothers? Huh?

12:01.333 --> 12:02.500
No, no, no.

12:02.583 --> 12:04.791
He is my dead wife's brother.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.375
Not brother.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.375
That sounds like a real tragic story.

12:11.416 --> 12:12.458
Have a seat.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.666
I don't know what the hell is it
with you people from the peninsula?

12:14.750 --> 12:18.291
You, uh... have an air about you.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.125
You have a lot of sad, sad tales...

12:21.583 --> 12:23.541
Let's get down to business.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.875
Should I say "your country"
or "the peninsula"?

12:27.458 --> 12:29.500
Look, I, I heard a rumor...

12:29.958 --> 12:33.375
There seems to be some people
that are going back down

12:33.458 --> 12:36.750
into the peninsula
to make their own fate.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.833
Zombies don't give a damn about all
that gold and money,

12:40.916 --> 12:43.708
which is just laying around there unguarded.

12:44.666 --> 12:46.208
I think it's ingenious.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.333
Wow.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.125
You want us to go back in there?

12:51.208 --> 12:52.708
Have you lost your mind?

12:53.416 --> 12:54.625
My brother,

12:55.375 --> 12:58.416
my mind is completely sound, thank you.

12:58.708 --> 12:59.708
Okay.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.333
So...

13:02.291 --> 13:04.708
the neighboring countries around the peninsula

13:04.791 --> 13:07.958
are controlling every ship
and plane that crosses the border.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
How would you get in or out?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.375
It's been done.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.166
You don't need to worry about the coast guard.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.625
As long as we keep paying them,

13:18.708 --> 13:21.000
the ships go in, the ships go out.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.125
As a matter of fact, technically,
we had the money and the truck.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.500
Twenty million dollars.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.166
Until we went missing halfway here.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.500
Where was the last time we...

13:30.583 --> 13:31.833
On the Omok Bridge.

13:31.958 --> 13:32.958
Mok-dong?

13:34.041 --> 13:35.041
What?

13:35.125 --> 13:36.583
Look, I don't think it's too difficult.

13:36.666 --> 13:38.250
You just go in at night,

13:38.333 --> 13:40.750
you get the truck, come back with the money,

13:40.833 --> 13:43.458
and don't worry about those zombies.

13:43.541 --> 13:46.208
I hear they are practically blind at night.

13:46.750 --> 13:47.833
So...

13:48.875 --> 13:50.791
How much money we get?

13:51.041 --> 13:52.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.666
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

13:56.083 --> 13:57.083
Half.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.041
That is, if you come back alive.

14:01.916 --> 14:05.833
That's 2.5 million dollars per head.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.041
Now listen to me.

14:08.208 --> 14:11.000
You have no idea when or even

14:11.208 --> 14:16.291
if the government is ever going
to grant you any refugee status,

14:16.375 --> 14:19.666
so you might as well make your own goddamn future.

14:19.750 --> 14:20.750
Think!

14:32.208 --> 14:36.333
We just have to hop on a boat,
and bring the truck back.

14:36.416 --> 14:37.750
What's so hard about that?

14:38.208 --> 14:39.833
It'll only take half a day.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.291
Are you nuts? You want to go back there?

14:50.750 --> 14:53.166
Then do you want to keep living here,
getting treated like scum?

14:57.708 --> 15:00.791
You should have let me die
with my son and wife!

15:01.291 --> 15:02.458
Why did you do it?

15:03.458 --> 15:07.041
Had I let you die, everyone on
that ship would've died.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.125
Am I wrong?

15:10.375 --> 15:11.791
It was a sensible decision.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.458
Sensible decision, my ass.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.458
Did you even try?

15:21.083 --> 15:22.125
Jung-seok...

15:23.541 --> 15:25.208
You're tormented too!

15:27.125 --> 15:28.833
You just gave up!

15:33.291 --> 15:35.875
Whatever, forget it.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.208
Okay.

15:38.166 --> 15:41.083
Well, I'm going to go there,

15:41.166 --> 15:44.666
so you can do whatever you want.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.833
Let's just not bump into each other.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.125
It's hard for both of us.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.416
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.750
Aren't they bastards from the peninsula?

15:55.833 --> 15:58.041
- What?
- Where the virus came from!

15:58.541 --> 16:00.666
Should you be letting them in here?

16:00.750 --> 16:01.750
Move aside.

16:01.833 --> 16:02.916
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.458
Do you even care about the others?

16:04.541 --> 16:05.583
Stop it.

16:05.666 --> 16:08.208
Is he infected?

16:08.291 --> 16:09.791
Come on. Stop.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.833
I won't take your money, so just leave!

16:13.416 --> 16:14.583
You go ahead.

16:47.708 --> 16:49.833
You're entering the peninsula waters.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.041
Turn back.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.166
You're entering the peninsula waters.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.250
Turn back.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.083
This is Z055 Chungpyung.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.791
- Hello?
- Hello?

17:02.708 --> 17:04.375
It's all good if there's no response.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.000
Almost there!

17:30.916 --> 17:33.208
No need to be so serious.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.291
Soon, you'll be rich!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.250
Take what you need.

17:38.125 --> 17:42.458
Don't forget, the zombies are blind at night
and sensitive to sound.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.708
And the important thing.

17:45.250 --> 17:50.291
We'll drop you off
and stay at sea nearby for three days.

17:54.833 --> 17:55.916
Take these.

17:56.875 --> 17:57.875
One for you.

17:58.458 --> 18:01.541
And... another.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.875
Call me when you get to the port with the truck

18:04.958 --> 18:06.916
and we'll pull up the boat.

18:11.541 --> 18:12.791
And lastly!

18:13.416 --> 18:16.916
You escaped out of there alive,
so you know better...

18:17.458 --> 18:20.708
Don't screw up trying
to save each other for nothing.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.125
Don't worry. We know.

18:23.541 --> 18:24.541
Great!

18:25.208 --> 18:26.375
Do not let us down.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.208
It makes me nervous that you two know each other.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.666
I know.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.458
We have to pull this off no matter what,

18:43.541 --> 18:45.875
so don't let your personal emotions
get mixed up in the way.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.208
We won't even see each other after this,
so don't worry.

18:50.916 --> 18:51.958
Fine.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.583
Whatever, man.

20:18.666 --> 20:25.625
GOD HAS FORSAKEN US

20:46.166 --> 20:47.500
We're not on a tour, you know.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.625
Let's hurry things along,
we should leave before sunrise.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.041
All right, let's get it over with.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.625
Jeez.

21:00.416 --> 21:01.583
Is it working?

21:04.125 --> 21:05.500
Nice!

21:26.625 --> 21:28.708
It's unrecognizable now. My goodness.

21:29.208 --> 21:32.083
The city became a ruin in just four years.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.125
Did you live near here?

21:35.125 --> 21:38.000
I used to drive a cab.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.166
So I pretty much know all the roads.

21:42.416 --> 21:45.041
At the very least,
those jerks put together a good team.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.041
A HEALTHY, CAREFREE COUNTRY

22:20.958 --> 22:22.208
Could that be it?

22:22.458 --> 22:23.625
Where?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.916
The plate number is 6431, right?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.708
We'll find out soon.

22:29.291 --> 22:31.208
You stay here, I'll go alone.

22:31.291 --> 22:32.333
What?

22:32.416 --> 22:34.291
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

23:40.583 --> 23:41.833
Come on, come on, come on!

23:43.000 --> 23:44.250
What's with you?

23:45.083 --> 23:46.250
Is that the truck?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.125
No, it isn't.

23:49.833 --> 23:51.958
It should be nearby.
Let's look around a bit more.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.250
There, I see one more.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.458
Let's check it out.

24:26.625 --> 24:27.875
Okay.

24:46.791 --> 24:50.500
I'll go have a look. You stay here.

24:50.583 --> 24:51.583
Stop it!

24:52.041 --> 24:53.333
I'm not on a tour, you know.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.250
We'll go together.

24:55.791 --> 24:56.791
Mister.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.958
Let's take a look.

25:20.458 --> 25:21.833
Are they Unit 631?

25:23.250 --> 25:25.875
No. They're not.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.041
Jackpot, we found it.

25:55.708 --> 25:56.791
It was true...

26:00.166 --> 26:02.166
What they said was true.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.375
It's all in US dollars. How much is all this?

26:05.208 --> 26:06.958
We confirmed it, so let's get going.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.041
Okay.

26:11.375 --> 26:12.375
Jeez.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.500
Hey! Over here!

26:19.291 --> 26:22.291
He must've been the last person to make contact.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.541
How unfortunate.

26:27.041 --> 26:29.000
He could've been a millionaire.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.958
But it's good for us.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.708
Let's pull him out and go.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.375
Oh, jeez...

26:38.583 --> 26:39.583
He stinks...

26:41.500 --> 26:43.750
Move your leg. Thank you.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.291
Thank you.

26:55.916 --> 26:56.916
Idiots.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.750
Are you okay?

27:08.208 --> 27:09.916
I'm fine, I wasn't bitten.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.541
Gosh, what are they up to?

27:35.250 --> 27:36.541
Get in the car, go!

27:39.416 --> 27:40.500
Back it up!

28:31.541 --> 28:32.791
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

28:32.875 --> 28:33.916
Come on, come on, come on!

28:34.000 --> 28:35.083
All right!

28:37.041 --> 28:37.791
Let's go!

28:37.791 --> 28:39.083
Go! Go!

28:47.291 --> 28:48.458
We're clear, we're clear!

28:48.666 --> 28:49.791
Thank you...

28:50.708 --> 28:53.291
So the money's really there?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.333
You're a millionaire!

28:58.541 --> 28:59.583
Yes!

28:59.666 --> 29:01.291
Awesome!

29:01.666 --> 29:03.000
What will you do with the money?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.541
Me? Uh...

29:04.625 --> 29:05.750
Maybe I'll hire a chauffeur.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.583
Like a real millionaire!

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
So we just have to get
to the harbor and call them in.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.875
This is a piece of cake!

29:18.833 --> 29:20.041
Give me the satellite phone.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.833
Huh? Sure, hold on.

29:33.875 --> 29:35.625
Here.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.291
What's that?

30:00.333 --> 30:01.375
Just drive!

30:01.583 --> 30:03.375
Go, go, go! Just go!

31:49.583 --> 31:50.833
Hop in, if you want to live.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.166
Sorry!

32:25.750 --> 32:27.125
You must've been scared.

32:28.125 --> 32:32.416
Yu-jin, I told you not
to act so friendly to strangers.

32:33.583 --> 32:34.791
Sit back properly.

34:24.958 --> 34:26.375
Dang, he passed out.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.041
Did I not tell him to buckle up?

34:33.625 --> 34:36.375
Joon-i, can you drive through them?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.541
I'm not sure.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.416
Then what? Do I need to get involved?

35:32.291 --> 35:33.500
Ooh...

35:33.583 --> 35:34.958
Ooh.

35:45.625 --> 35:46.833
Uh?

35:55.166 --> 35:56.250
Really?

35:56.958 --> 36:00.375
The ground was weird, it wasn't my fault.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.208
Oh.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.958
I really liked that one, though.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.458
CITY NIGHT CLUB

37:49.458 --> 37:51.875
It's a grocery truck. Nice.

37:52.791 --> 37:54.166
It looks new.

37:59.083 --> 38:01.083
- Who's that?
- He's alive!

38:03.708 --> 38:06.458
- Please, help me...
- Be careful.

38:06.666 --> 38:10.250
- Be careful.
- Help me, I'm begging you...

38:14.041 --> 38:15.875
Help me, please.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.583
What the hell's going on?

38:18.083 --> 38:19.500
He's just an infected, you jerks.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.125
Have you never seen one before?

38:21.666 --> 38:22.666
Please...

38:22.750 --> 38:24.541
It's all right, come here.

38:45.083 --> 38:49.708
Sir, please, help me...

38:49.791 --> 38:52.375
I'm begging you...

38:56.416 --> 38:58.500
- Give it to me.
- Here you go!

39:01.333 --> 39:02.708
Sir...

39:05.916 --> 39:07.291
Nice shot!

39:07.500 --> 39:09.041
Wow, he killed him properly.

39:09.833 --> 39:10.958
Damn it!

39:12.916 --> 39:14.958
It got on my pants. I should get it washed.

39:15.625 --> 39:16.625
Here.

39:17.791 --> 39:19.041
Let's get back, the sun will rise.

39:19.583 --> 39:20.583
Shit...

39:20.958 --> 39:23.416
- Let's go.
- The zombies are coming!

39:25.958 --> 39:27.666
Huh?

39:48.583 --> 39:50.208
You little rascals!

39:50.541 --> 39:53.791
You brought something dangerous instead
of what you were supposed to get.

39:53.916 --> 39:54.958
Hey!

39:55.541 --> 39:59.083
You'd have been locked up for insubordination
if it were the old days!

40:05.791 --> 40:07.083
Lieutenant Yoon! Captain Hwang!

40:07.166 --> 40:08.166
Assemble!

40:08.666 --> 40:10.083
Aren't you going to make a report?

40:10.166 --> 40:11.666
Did you get what I asked?

40:11.958 --> 40:14.625
Salute! Division commander, we did not get it!

40:16.583 --> 40:17.583
Hey!

40:17.916 --> 40:19.250
How could you not get it?

40:19.333 --> 40:21.541
The ROK-US Combined Forces Command
is waiting for my call!

40:21.625 --> 40:22.916
Without batteries...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.125
Come on!

40:24.208 --> 40:25.791
- Are you having fun?
- Joon-i!

40:26.333 --> 40:27.875
- Captain Hwang!
- Grandpa!

40:28.500 --> 40:30.416
How long will you go on with that army stuff?

40:30.500 --> 40:31.500
Aren't you sick of it?

40:31.583 --> 40:32.833
No, it's for real this time!

40:32.916 --> 40:35.500
The newly appointed Major Jane
is totally different.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.208
She and I get along.

40:37.291 --> 40:40.250
And it seems like we'll get rescued soon.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.708
Listen to me, I'm good friends with her, so--

40:42.791 --> 40:44.750
- Stop it! I'm sick of it!
- Yu-jin, you believe me, right?

40:44.833 --> 40:45.833
Who are you?

40:48.791 --> 40:51.166
I guess you've never experienced
a wild dog hunt before.

40:51.250 --> 40:52.750
You should've known that such trucks

40:52.833 --> 40:54.416
would attract their attention.

40:54.750 --> 40:55.833
"Truck"?

40:55.916 --> 40:57.250
Who's that?

40:57.333 --> 40:58.333
Mom!

41:03.500 --> 41:07.666
Sir! Please!

41:09.708 --> 41:12.375
He was almost caught by Unit 631.

41:13.583 --> 41:14.958
You went outside again?

41:15.583 --> 41:17.291
I convinced her to go.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.958
Why don't you ever listen to me?

41:20.750 --> 41:21.916
I'm sorry, Mom.

41:23.666 --> 41:26.250
They're batteries. Grandpa, she got batteries!

41:27.958 --> 41:29.875
Okay! Okay!

41:32.583 --> 41:33.583
They fit.

41:33.666 --> 41:35.666
Hi, Jane? Jane? Major Jane?

41:36.250 --> 41:38.791
Oh, Jane! Oh, Jane! Okay!

41:40.625 --> 41:41.833
Are you okay?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.541
- I'm okay! Yeah!
- You should turn it on.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.041
We are strong soldiers! No problem!

41:46.125 --> 41:47.375
I'm Yu-jin!

41:49.666 --> 41:50.750
When are you coming?

41:50.833 --> 41:53.083
- So people still live here...
- They said they're coming!

41:54.875 --> 41:55.958
Who are you?

41:56.583 --> 41:57.916
Are you with Unit 631?

42:01.875 --> 42:03.916
I don't know what 631 is.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.958
I came to Incheon by boat yesterday.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.333
From Hong Kong.

42:10.791 --> 42:11.791
What?

42:12.916 --> 42:14.375
From where?

42:25.583 --> 42:27.291
Damn, the sun is rising.

42:28.708 --> 42:30.375
Let's hurry up.

42:35.541 --> 42:37.041
The third platoon is returning!

42:37.125 --> 42:38.500
Open the gate!

42:48.250 --> 42:50.708
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six boxes of cookies.

42:51.083 --> 42:52.291
That's all correct.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.000
Scrap soup again?

42:56.291 --> 42:57.416
Eat if you want to live.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.583
That looks good. Have a great meal!

43:00.666 --> 43:02.625
Have a nice meal. Have a nice meal.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.458
The third platoon is back!

43:06.541 --> 43:07.875
They're here!

43:17.833 --> 43:21.541
- They're back!
- They're here!

43:23.208 --> 43:25.416
Great work, everyone.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.166
Look! Isn't it awesome?

43:27.250 --> 43:28.875
- Yeah!
- It sure is.

43:28.958 --> 43:30.583
My boys worked so hard!

43:30.666 --> 43:33.000
Bring us a can of tuna, that's all I ask!

43:33.083 --> 43:34.291
- I'm sorry, sir...
- No, bring one.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.000
We were told to keep a tight lid on supplies.

43:36.083 --> 43:38.541
If I keep handing out stuff,
there won't be anything left.

43:38.625 --> 43:39.833
And Captain Seo is...

43:40.416 --> 43:41.583
One can is too much?

43:41.833 --> 43:42.833
That's not it...

43:43.166 --> 43:44.166
Bring it.

43:44.416 --> 43:45.458
They're serving food at the cafeteria.

43:45.541 --> 43:46.541
Get it!

43:46.625 --> 43:47.708
I said bring it!

43:47.958 --> 43:49.375
So I should just have scraps?

43:49.625 --> 43:50.666
That's not...

43:50.750 --> 43:51.750
Do you want it?

43:52.083 --> 43:54.208
I have to report to Captain Seo first.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.291
Just bring it, asshole!

43:57.500 --> 44:01.541
Report to a guy who's never even fought before?

44:01.958 --> 44:03.291
He's my commander.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.416
- Sergeant...
- Piss off, you bastard!

44:07.083 --> 44:08.833
- What was that?
- I'm talking here!

44:09.208 --> 44:10.708
- What was that?
- Hello?

44:11.125 --> 44:14.041
- Where is it coming from?
- I heard something.

44:17.041 --> 44:18.500
- What? A person?
- Hang on.

44:18.583 --> 44:21.125
Sir, we have a wild dog here.

44:21.958 --> 44:22.958
- What?
- Get him.

44:23.250 --> 44:24.541
What's a wild dog?

44:26.875 --> 44:28.250
Are you soldiers?

44:28.750 --> 44:31.125
Help me, I'm not from here.

44:32.250 --> 44:33.250
Get up, you bastard.

44:33.333 --> 44:34.791
Has the game started?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.041
It hasn't, sir.

44:36.125 --> 44:37.666
Take him to the arena.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.791
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go!

44:41.166 --> 44:42.875
We have a new player!

44:47.541 --> 44:51.958
Keep sucking up to Captain Seo,
and I'll kill you both.

44:52.041 --> 44:53.041
Got that?

44:55.041 --> 44:56.916
You little...

44:59.958 --> 45:01.083
Hey! Hey!

45:02.083 --> 45:03.500
He probably wasted all the flares

45:03.583 --> 45:05.083
without knowing what to get.

45:05.583 --> 45:06.666
That idiot.

45:07.083 --> 45:10.875
He brought so much useless crap last time.

45:15.875 --> 45:17.083
What the hell?

45:17.500 --> 45:19.291
We are strong soldiers!

45:19.583 --> 45:20.875
Strong! Strong!

45:21.791 --> 45:23.041
Strong. Strong.

45:24.291 --> 45:26.416
No one ever came to rescue us in four years,

45:27.458 --> 45:29.125
but some chump change was all it took?

45:32.041 --> 45:33.375
What about your group?

45:38.250 --> 45:39.333
They're all dead.

45:41.208 --> 45:42.291
Everyone.

45:44.666 --> 45:45.875
We got a fresh one!

46:00.416 --> 46:01.791
Hey there, cutie!

46:07.125 --> 46:08.500
Who were those soldiers?

46:08.583 --> 46:10.250
They're called Unit 631.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.250
They used to be a military unit dispatched
to rescue civilians.

46:13.791 --> 46:15.708
You were with them?

46:15.791 --> 46:18.166
We lived there before we escaped.

46:18.250 --> 46:19.750
At first.

46:21.541 --> 46:23.041
They sent out SOS signals for a few years,

46:23.125 --> 46:24.250
which were left unanswered.

46:25.458 --> 46:27.416
After that, they gave up everything,

46:27.541 --> 46:29.625
and now they're all crazy.

46:31.291 --> 46:33.958
Hawaii

47:05.625 --> 47:06.958
Hm.

47:07.833 --> 47:08.916
I'm leaving.

47:18.083 --> 47:19.083
Yes?

47:27.875 --> 47:30.583
Bang!

47:32.041 --> 47:35.208
Awesome, that's great.

47:39.333 --> 47:41.708
I'm not someone who takes bribes, take it back.

47:41.833 --> 47:43.750
Gosh, you're making me sad.

47:43.833 --> 47:45.875
I don't take bribes!

47:45.958 --> 47:47.291
Look at it, it's Black Label.

47:48.416 --> 47:51.083
Thanks, I was finishing my last drink.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.500
Here, accept my drink.

48:02.833 --> 48:04.166
Nothing to report again?

48:04.250 --> 48:05.791
No, nothing happened.

48:06.375 --> 48:10.875
Sergeant Hwang stole a truck
from wild dogs overnight,

48:11.416 --> 48:14.708
and was boasting like crazy,

48:14.791 --> 48:16.791
acting all high and mighty...

48:17.625 --> 48:20.833
So where did our valiant sergeant go today

48:20.916 --> 48:23.458
and what adventure did he have?

48:25.583 --> 48:27.125
What did he bring in?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.750
Captain, that's the weird thing.

48:31.208 --> 48:32.875
The truck was full of US dollars.

48:32.958 --> 48:34.083
US dollars?

48:35.125 --> 48:36.125
How much?

48:37.041 --> 48:39.250
It was quite a bit.

48:39.625 --> 48:42.708
About 20 bags full of them.

48:43.291 --> 48:46.333
But why do you think those idiotic wild dogs

48:46.416 --> 48:49.583
were transporting completely useless money?

48:52.333 --> 48:53.583
Where is it now?

48:54.833 --> 48:56.625
So they took the truck.

48:57.375 --> 48:58.625
What about the satellite phone?

48:59.416 --> 49:01.458
It should be by the driver's seat.

49:09.916 --> 49:12.958
Sir, I'm not from here!

49:14.166 --> 49:16.250
I'm from Hong Kong!

49:18.166 --> 49:19.250
This is brand new.

49:19.333 --> 49:21.125
It's rare. Today is your lucky day.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.416
Got anything else?

49:22.666 --> 49:25.375
I have... a satellite phone!

49:26.750 --> 49:30.041
With a satellite phone,
we can all get out of here!

49:30.958 --> 49:32.500
- Show us!
- Right here!

49:32.875 --> 49:35.208
- You lying sack of shit!
- He doesn't have it!

49:40.291 --> 49:42.791
Where do you think they
were heading with this money?

49:50.083 --> 49:51.791
Sir, where's the truck?

49:53.041 --> 49:54.375
Stop that!

49:54.708 --> 49:55.958
Stop! Please!

49:58.000 --> 49:59.541
Ah...

50:07.625 --> 50:08.708
He's really fresh!

50:08.791 --> 50:11.875
This guy's in good shape. He's a Grade A!

50:15.416 --> 50:16.541
Can you run well?

50:17.125 --> 50:18.125
No?

50:21.333 --> 50:22.500
What should his number be?

50:22.583 --> 50:23.875
Give him Park Chan-ho's number.

50:23.958 --> 50:24.958
Number 61!

50:25.041 --> 50:26.375
Number 61 it is!

50:26.458 --> 50:30.416
Major League pitcher!

50:31.083 --> 50:32.208
That's a great number!

50:37.083 --> 50:38.208
Turn around!

50:41.166 --> 50:43.541
I'm betting a chocolate bar on him.

50:48.708 --> 50:50.791
Sir, where's the truck?

51:02.750 --> 51:06.041
Sir! I'm not from here!

51:06.666 --> 51:08.625
There's money in the truck! Go check it out!

51:08.708 --> 51:11.583
We can all leave if we have that, you idiots!

51:32.583 --> 51:33.583
What...

51:38.750 --> 51:39.791
Hello?

51:39.875 --> 51:41.375
Where are you? The sun is out.

51:41.791 --> 51:42.916
What's going on?

51:44.250 --> 51:46.416
Hello. Who are you?

51:46.708 --> 51:47.708
What?

51:47.791 --> 51:49.083
Who the hell are you?

51:49.250 --> 51:50.500
Where's the money?

52:16.833 --> 52:18.041
Where are you going?

52:19.125 --> 52:20.458
I don't think we should go out...

52:24.125 --> 52:26.208
Number 61! Get out!

52:27.958 --> 52:29.125
Get the hell out!

53:02.541 --> 53:04.041
I don't care who you are.

53:04.125 --> 53:05.125
Just bring the money.

53:05.208 --> 53:07.500
The terms are the same
as the guys we sent in...

53:07.750 --> 53:10.916
Half the money to anyone
that brings it out. Okay?

53:11.625 --> 53:15.000
Are you saying we can get out of here?

53:15.083 --> 53:16.958
We are waiting around Incheon Port.

53:17.041 --> 53:18.583
You call me when you get there.

53:19.250 --> 53:20.291
It's so easy!

53:21.083 --> 53:23.333
Easy, easy. I can do it. I can do it.

53:23.416 --> 53:24.458
All right.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.458
You can drive, right?

53:34.625 --> 53:36.625
Let's just go now, Mom.

53:37.583 --> 53:39.583
I'll bulldoze them all with my car.

53:42.208 --> 53:45.083
You'll just go in there? In broad daylight?

54:59.916 --> 55:02.166
Run faster!

55:21.708 --> 55:25.708
It's time for us. To say goodbye

55:26.083 --> 55:28.541
Let's meet again soon

55:30.041 --> 55:34.041
It's time for us. To say goodbye

55:34.375 --> 55:36.958
Let's meet again soon

55:39.666 --> 55:40.875
Hey, buddy!

55:42.083 --> 55:43.708
If you don't hurry, the doors will shut!

56:10.958 --> 56:12.208
You must be tired.

56:12.375 --> 56:13.625
You did great.

56:13.708 --> 56:15.083
How about a feast?

56:15.291 --> 56:16.708
You want it? Really?

56:17.833 --> 56:19.500
Have some ramen!

56:19.916 --> 56:22.166
Eat slowly! Share them with your friends!

56:22.250 --> 56:23.541
Greedy bastards.

56:28.750 --> 56:29.875
You should share them!

56:31.833 --> 56:35.125
It's too dangerous now.
Let's move after sundown.

56:35.208 --> 56:37.875
I think we can go now, though...

56:38.750 --> 56:40.333
Go? Go where?

56:41.708 --> 56:44.125
Grandpa, we're moving. Let's pack up.

56:44.416 --> 56:45.458
Move?

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Where?

56:47.083 --> 56:48.791
We're going to Incheon Port.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.500
Incheon Port? Are we going to ride a boat?

56:50.583 --> 56:51.583
Okay!

56:51.666 --> 56:52.791
No, no, no!

56:53.208 --> 56:56.583
We must stay here until Jane
comes to rescue us.

56:56.666 --> 56:58.458
It was so hard convincing her!

56:58.541 --> 57:01.208
If Major Jane is coming,
tell her to come to the port.

57:01.291 --> 57:02.625
No way!

57:02.708 --> 57:04.083
You said you two are close.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.416
I guess you aren't.

57:07.208 --> 57:08.208
We're close.

57:08.416 --> 57:10.208
Okay, it's doable.

57:10.958 --> 57:12.416
Incheon? Incheon Port?

57:12.500 --> 57:14.583
- Grandpa, hurry!
- Okay.

57:17.166 --> 57:19.958
You'll take a crazy old man and little kids

57:21.541 --> 57:24.000
to steal a truck from armed soldiers?

57:25.000 --> 57:28.083
Then should I continue living here with my girls?

57:29.458 --> 57:31.333
If you're scared, stay here.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.541
I'll give you this place at a cheap price.

57:36.916 --> 57:38.625
Get him a first aid kit,

57:39.458 --> 57:41.583
and get some sleep. We'll leave after sundown.

58:01.291 --> 58:02.833
Why did you save me earlier?

58:04.166 --> 58:06.625
I was going to leave, but she wanted to save you.

58:07.625 --> 58:11.416
Dad told us we should help the weak
before he went to heaven.

58:12.583 --> 58:14.458
You looked weak.

58:16.708 --> 58:18.666
Stop yapping and go to bed.

58:18.750 --> 58:19.750
No!

58:19.833 --> 58:21.750
I'm going to bed soon too, so go to sleep!

58:21.833 --> 58:22.958
I don't want to!

58:23.375 --> 58:25.083
One! Two!

58:26.541 --> 58:27.666
She's always like that...

58:27.750 --> 58:29.291
She thinks she's so big now.

58:30.958 --> 58:32.541
Maybe we should've left you there.

58:33.166 --> 58:34.875
You're complaining when we saved you.

58:35.958 --> 58:37.416
You look like a zombie.

58:43.458 --> 58:45.791
Mm...

58:47.041 --> 58:49.125
How long does it take to get to Incheon Port?

58:49.208 --> 58:50.500
If we find an unobstructed route,

58:50.583 --> 58:51.958
it'll only take thirty minutes.

58:52.291 --> 58:54.250
Thirty minutes, thirty minutes, thirty minutes...

58:55.208 --> 58:56.750
What about zombies? Wouldn't it be dangerous?

58:56.833 --> 58:58.000
They bite and stuff.

58:58.083 --> 58:59.250
- Captain.
- Yes?

58:59.958 --> 59:01.750
We need to get out of here.

59:01.875 --> 59:03.750
Forget about the zombies!

59:04.666 --> 59:06.416
Should we bring Sergeant Hwang?

59:07.125 --> 59:09.666
He's more dangerous than the zombies.

59:09.750 --> 59:10.750
You're right.

59:10.833 --> 59:13.375
I can keep the gatekeepers off our backs,

59:13.958 --> 59:17.500
but sharp-witted Sergeant Hwang
might get suspicious.

59:19.416 --> 59:21.250
Yes, you're right.

59:22.291 --> 59:28.291
Then I just have to find a way
to distract him, right?

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:11.541
Sir? Sir!

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:14.458
Sir! Please!

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:19.000
Sir! Please just take my girl!

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:26.041
Jung-seok, why are you the only one alive?

1:01:00.375 --> 1:01:01.583
Put it down.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.250
You'll drain the batteries.

1:01:08.750 --> 1:01:11.583
Did Major Jane say she's coming to Incheon Port?

1:01:11.666 --> 1:01:12.750
Huh?

1:01:15.833 --> 1:01:18.791
She should. She has to.

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:23.375
She better rescue my little darlings.

1:01:23.833 --> 1:01:25.291
My treasures.

1:01:26.458 --> 1:01:28.166
Yu-jin and Joon-i,

1:01:29.375 --> 1:01:32.125
they're the beacon of hope in this hell.

1:01:35.041 --> 1:01:40.208
I'll get them out of this hell no matter what.

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:46.083
Major Jane is coming, right?

1:02:07.750 --> 1:02:08.791
Are you okay?

1:02:09.916 --> 1:02:13.583
We stole these when we fled. Take what you need.

1:02:16.916 --> 1:02:19.041
I actually saw you before.

1:02:19.833 --> 1:02:20.833
I...

1:02:21.416 --> 1:02:24.833
came across your family
when I was fleeing to board the ship.

1:02:26.541 --> 1:02:28.250
You begged me to take your girl.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:34.916
Why are you telling me that now?

1:02:36.333 --> 1:02:37.375
Because you feel guilty?

1:02:38.458 --> 1:02:39.666
There were 31 cars.

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:42.625
There were 31 cars that drove past us.

1:02:43.833 --> 1:02:45.750
I thought the first car would stop to help us.

1:02:46.333 --> 1:02:47.708
Or maybe the next one...

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.750
All 31 cars just drove by.

1:02:56.708 --> 1:02:58.416
You're indebted to my girls.

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:06.375
Yu-jin, I'm buttoning you up.
Stand up straight!

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:10.666
Are we going on a boat ride now?

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:13.750
Yes, we just have to get something first.

1:03:17.458 --> 1:03:18.625
What about my cars?

1:03:18.958 --> 1:03:21.458
No way, we can't take them all.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:26.250
Then just this one!

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:27.625
Put it down.

1:03:27.708 --> 1:03:29.375
Please, just one!

1:03:30.083 --> 1:03:31.708
Let me take one!

1:03:35.250 --> 1:03:36.291
Let's go.

1:04:26.833 --> 1:04:27.916
Joon-i.

1:04:28.666 --> 1:04:32.750
Stay here. If I'm not back by sunrise,
head back home.

1:04:33.375 --> 1:04:34.541
Just the three of us?

1:04:35.291 --> 1:04:36.500
What about you?

1:04:37.083 --> 1:04:38.375
How will you come home?

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:41.208
I'll find my way somehow,

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:43.083
so don't worry and head home.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.458
And don't ever leave the car, got it?

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:52.500
Answer me.

1:04:54.666 --> 1:04:55.666
Okay.

1:04:57.666 --> 1:04:59.125
Yu-jin, come here.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.041
I'll be back soon. Listen to your sister, okay?

1:05:07.625 --> 1:05:09.583
You'll really be back soon, right?

1:05:09.875 --> 1:05:11.250
Of course, I'll be right back.

1:05:23.666 --> 1:05:26.791
Commander, take good care of my girls.

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:32.958
Let's go.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:37.166
It's an emergency exit that we found
when we lived here.

1:07:12.875 --> 1:07:14.083
What the hell?

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:33.166
Is that it?

1:07:36.666 --> 1:07:38.166
Yes, that's the one.

1:07:39.583 --> 1:07:40.750
Let's move quickly.

1:07:44.250 --> 1:07:46.083
Ah, ah, ah.

1:07:46.166 --> 1:07:48.833
I brought good news.

1:07:50.875 --> 1:07:57.000
Last night, the third platoon led by Sergeant Hwang

1:07:57.083 --> 1:07:58.541
brought home a truck.

1:07:59.166 --> 1:08:03.416
There was enough food for everyone to eat

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:05.041
for an entire month.

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:12.083
You've worked so hard, I know you did!

1:08:12.166 --> 1:08:17.208
So tonight... there'll be an unlimited game

1:08:17.291 --> 1:08:19.000
for 24 hours!

1:08:21.625 --> 1:08:24.000
And remember.

1:08:24.458 --> 1:08:26.625
Have fun like there's no tomorrow.

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:27.916
Have a great time!

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:35.083
There will be no tomorrow.

1:08:35.375 --> 1:08:39.125
Stop cheering. Doesn't he seem strange?

1:08:39.250 --> 1:08:40.375
I think he's high.

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:42.916
I'm not sure. Let's enjoy this!

1:08:47.833 --> 1:08:50.375
Hey, look over there.

1:08:50.916 --> 1:08:52.041
Shouldn't we report that?

1:08:52.541 --> 1:08:55.541
There aren't that many. Why bother reporting?

1:08:56.375 --> 1:08:57.666
Forget it, don't mind them.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.125
Listen.

1:09:33.916 --> 1:09:35.666
Since you owe my girls,

1:09:37.125 --> 1:09:39.125
do me a favor later.

1:09:53.541 --> 1:09:57.291
Johnnie Walker Black Label!

1:10:00.625 --> 1:10:01.708
You're back.

1:10:03.125 --> 1:10:06.750
Are you supposed to have booze here?

1:10:06.833 --> 1:10:07.875
Well...

1:10:08.125 --> 1:10:11.500
The game is about to start. What brings you here?

1:10:11.583 --> 1:10:14.458
I haven't seen your face in ages.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:18.416
Could I have a sip?

1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:19.833
Sure, help yourself.

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:21.083
- Really?
- Sure.

1:10:22.125 --> 1:10:24.375
So why are you here?

1:10:24.541 --> 1:10:26.833
Do you have something to report?

1:10:26.916 --> 1:10:31.333
No, I was just curious
what gets you up in the morning.

1:10:33.375 --> 1:10:34.750
Hm?

1:10:41.625 --> 1:10:42.666
It's good?

1:10:42.875 --> 1:10:44.125
So good!

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.291
If you love it that much,
you can take the bottle.

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:51.125
It's my gift to you.

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:54.666
- What's with you?
- What?

1:10:55.750 --> 1:10:58.916
I begged for some snacks
for my boys to boost morale,

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.750
but all we got were scraps.

1:11:01.750 --> 1:11:03.333
You were acting so cheap.

1:11:05.166 --> 1:11:06.875
So why the sudden generosity?

1:11:08.041 --> 1:11:10.583
I think I told everyone with my speech earlier.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:15.916
We owe so much to you and your men...

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.041
Bullshit!

1:11:20.458 --> 1:11:23.666
I was just kidding.

1:11:24.875 --> 1:11:28.833
Captain Seo, are you hiding something from me?

1:11:30.833 --> 1:11:32.708
No, of course not.

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:37.208
Captain Seo, I...

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:40.958
Private Kim?

1:11:42.333 --> 1:11:45.000
Do you visit Captain Seo's quarters frequently?

1:11:46.750 --> 1:11:49.208
No... I do not.

1:12:13.583 --> 1:12:16.000
Ah.

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:18.916
You two are a thing?

1:12:20.458 --> 1:12:22.125
- Yes.
- My apologies!

1:12:24.583 --> 1:12:27.083
I'm so clueless.

1:12:27.916 --> 1:12:29.041
I'll leave you two alone.

1:12:30.208 --> 1:12:31.333
Just the two of you...

1:12:31.416 --> 1:12:33.625
Hm?

1:12:34.416 --> 1:12:37.708
I'll tell the boys to avoid dropping in,

1:12:37.791 --> 1:12:38.958
so have a great time.

1:12:39.041 --> 1:12:42.541
Have a hot time, okay?

1:12:43.250 --> 1:12:44.291
All right.

1:12:45.083 --> 1:12:47.041
Love, love is...

1:12:48.958 --> 1:12:51.166
Sir, the preparation is done.
Shall we get to the truck?

1:12:51.250 --> 1:12:53.625
You go ahead. I have something to do first.

1:12:53.708 --> 1:12:54.708
Yes, sir.

1:12:56.916 --> 1:12:59.041
Does he have a death wish or what?

1:13:09.583 --> 1:13:13.125
Joon-i, look up ahead! Quickly!

1:13:23.083 --> 1:13:24.208
It's a march.

1:13:33.958 --> 1:13:36.291
That road is too close to Unit 631.

1:13:36.375 --> 1:13:38.083
Aren't we going to go greet Mom?

1:14:09.791 --> 1:14:11.000
The money is intact.

1:14:33.125 --> 1:14:36.125
Hey, can't you take me with you?

1:14:36.791 --> 1:14:38.250
I really want to get out of here.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:41.875
Go where? Who told you about that?

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:45.791
I overheard Captain Seo talking
on the satellite phone.

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:47.958
Please take me with you.

1:14:48.375 --> 1:14:49.708
Satellite phone?

1:14:50.333 --> 1:14:51.625
Where did you get it?

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.416
The wild dog we found in the truck had it.

1:14:55.250 --> 1:14:56.416
Private Kim!

1:14:56.500 --> 1:14:58.000
Aren't you going to see the game?

1:14:59.375 --> 1:15:00.791
Answer naturally.

1:15:03.916 --> 1:15:05.083
I'm all right.

1:15:05.583 --> 1:15:07.250
You always say that. Oh, right.

1:15:07.666 --> 1:15:10.250
That wild dog who came with the truck,

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:11.958
that guy was no joke.

1:15:12.333 --> 1:15:15.583
He was struggling so much to survive.

1:15:16.750 --> 1:15:18.666
I bet all my canned goods on him!

1:15:19.541 --> 1:15:20.625
I'll see you later.

1:15:22.375 --> 1:15:23.958
Where is the phone now?

1:15:24.416 --> 1:15:25.916
It's not with me.

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:27.583
Captain Seo has it. He'll be here soon.

1:15:31.708 --> 1:15:32.916
Get going.

1:15:33.958 --> 1:15:35.250
I can't wait long.

1:15:41.625 --> 1:15:44.666
Act naturally when that bastard comes, got it?

1:15:46.291 --> 1:15:47.375
Okay...

1:15:48.875 --> 1:15:51.333
Number 61!

1:16:13.958 --> 1:16:15.333
What are you doing? Let's move!

1:16:17.291 --> 1:16:18.583
Captain...

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.583
Long time no see, Captain Seo.

1:16:23.291 --> 1:16:25.458
Min-jung, you were alive. Gosh.

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:28.291
You have the satellite phone, right?

1:16:28.375 --> 1:16:29.500
Hand it over.

1:16:31.458 --> 1:16:32.708
The satellite phone...

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.500
Give me a second.

1:16:35.333 --> 1:16:36.916
Mm. Oh.

1:16:50.666 --> 1:16:51.708
Wasn't that a gunshot?

1:16:51.791 --> 1:16:53.541
Like hell it was. Just shut up and eat this tuna.

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:54.666
Hey!

1:16:59.666 --> 1:17:00.708
Oh.

1:17:03.083 --> 1:17:04.166
Let's go get Mom.

1:17:21.125 --> 1:17:22.916
Look! That bastard!

1:17:27.791 --> 1:17:29.250
Gun! Get the guns!

1:17:32.833 --> 1:17:34.541
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

1:17:35.208 --> 1:17:36.208
Can you get up?

1:17:36.666 --> 1:17:38.583
Yes, I can get up. I can get up.

1:17:45.916 --> 1:17:47.166
Stay behind me.

1:17:49.791 --> 1:17:52.166
Hey, where did he go?

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:53.500
Jesus Christ...

1:17:55.750 --> 1:17:58.958
Min-jung, I was so worried...

1:18:01.041 --> 1:18:02.958
That's mine, give it back...

1:18:06.833 --> 1:18:07.875
Sergeant!

1:18:09.916 --> 1:18:11.583
Where did that bastard go?

1:18:15.875 --> 1:18:17.083
Go look for him.

1:18:24.541 --> 1:18:25.708
Block the entrance!

1:18:29.875 --> 1:18:30.916
Move!

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:22.041
Fire! Fire!

1:19:49.125 --> 1:19:50.500
Hey. Go forward.

1:20:19.625 --> 1:20:20.625
Damn it!

1:20:20.791 --> 1:20:21.791
Jung-seok!

1:20:37.625 --> 1:20:38.708
Sergeant!

1:21:22.708 --> 1:21:23.916
Come on!

1:22:08.041 --> 1:22:10.625
Hurry! Get in!

1:22:15.250 --> 1:22:17.125
Get in! Come on!

1:22:21.333 --> 1:22:22.708
Snap out of it!

1:22:23.416 --> 1:22:24.666
Come on!

1:22:26.083 --> 1:22:27.166
Hurry!

1:22:47.541 --> 1:22:50.541
Go after them!

1:23:05.291 --> 1:23:07.083
Captain, are you okay?

1:23:10.208 --> 1:23:11.375
What do we do now, sir?

1:23:14.666 --> 1:23:15.750
Captain!

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.666
You did all you can.

1:23:26.166 --> 1:23:27.458
That's what matters.

1:23:27.791 --> 1:23:28.916
Get it together.

1:23:53.833 --> 1:23:54.916
Sergeant Hwang!

1:23:56.916 --> 1:23:58.000
Step on it!

1:24:01.333 --> 1:24:05.166
It's time for us. To say goodbye

1:24:05.791 --> 1:24:07.833
Let's meet again soon

1:25:21.750 --> 1:25:22.833
Grandpa, hurry!

1:25:23.208 --> 1:25:24.583
Okay!

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.250
Open the window.

1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:53.875
Mom!

1:25:54.375 --> 1:25:57.000
We came to greet you!

1:25:57.083 --> 1:25:59.333
Why don't you ever listen to me?

1:26:00.583 --> 1:26:01.708
Come on!

1:26:15.708 --> 1:26:16.916
Yee-haw!

1:26:42.166 --> 1:26:44.291
- Hold on.
- Okay!

1:27:13.208 --> 1:27:18.291
Hey! Stop with the damn flares!
Just kill them all!

1:27:38.208 --> 1:27:39.333
They're behind us!

1:27:45.708 --> 1:27:46.875
Hold on tight!

1:28:00.375 --> 1:28:01.583
Come on!

1:28:11.625 --> 1:28:13.541
You asshole!

1:28:21.833 --> 1:28:23.041
He's not bad.

1:29:09.458 --> 1:29:11.416
Pull up closer, asshole!

1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:12.916
This way, move up!

1:29:14.083 --> 1:29:15.083
Kill him!

1:29:30.583 --> 1:29:32.041
Watch the front, asshole!

1:29:32.416 --> 1:29:33.500
Hold the wheel!

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:36.500
Hey!

1:29:46.708 --> 1:29:47.791
Turn on the lights.

1:30:13.458 --> 1:30:14.708
To our right!

1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:32.541
Beside you!

1:30:56.708 --> 1:30:57.708
Watch out!

1:31:43.125 --> 1:31:44.250
Hold on tight!

1:32:57.958 --> 1:32:59.291
Go over to the right!

1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:32.791
Hey! Back up, back up, back up!

1:33:38.541 --> 1:33:40.750
Back it up!

1:33:42.208 --> 1:33:45.125
I said back it up, asshole!

1:33:48.833 --> 1:33:50.625
Just step on it!

1:33:51.708 --> 1:33:54.041
Back the shit up!

1:33:54.833 --> 1:33:56.708
What the hell are you doing? Back it up!

1:34:00.791 --> 1:34:01.875
You bastard!

1:34:27.958 --> 1:34:29.250
We're almost there.

1:34:39.416 --> 1:34:42.083
We arrive at Incheon Port in 15 minutes.

1:35:17.250 --> 1:35:18.250
Joon-i.

1:35:18.875 --> 1:35:21.666
Is that the boat? Oh, yes!

1:35:32.833 --> 1:35:33.875
Yu-jin...

1:35:34.666 --> 1:35:35.791
Yu-jin, are you okay?

1:35:37.083 --> 1:35:38.125
Hi.

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:42.500
Joon-i!

1:35:45.291 --> 1:35:47.708
Put down your gun! Come on!

1:35:49.708 --> 1:35:50.791
Drop it!

1:35:51.333 --> 1:35:53.333
Do you want to see her head blown up?

1:35:53.416 --> 1:35:54.500
Put it down!

1:35:59.541 --> 1:36:01.958
Kick it! Kick it away!

1:36:02.875 --> 1:36:04.291
Yes, that's it.

1:36:08.291 --> 1:36:10.375
I can finally get off this peninsula...

1:36:11.083 --> 1:36:16.125
When I leave, I'm going to live
to the fullest in Hong Kong.

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:21.500
They won't know what I did here.

1:36:21.875 --> 1:36:23.833
I'm going to be a good man.

1:36:24.583 --> 1:36:28.000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:36:28.083 --> 1:36:29.666
I'll thank you every night.

1:36:30.125 --> 1:36:32.291
I really mean it. Thank you so much.

1:36:32.375 --> 1:36:34.791
I love you all!

1:36:34.875 --> 1:36:35.875
Now!

1:36:38.875 --> 1:36:39.875
Okay...

1:36:45.958 --> 1:36:46.958
No!

1:37:18.291 --> 1:37:19.750
Grandpa...

1:37:20.708 --> 1:37:23.458
Grandpa, are you okay?

1:37:23.833 --> 1:37:25.083
Grandpa...

1:37:25.291 --> 1:37:26.875
Mom! Mom...

1:38:00.458 --> 1:38:01.541
The sun is rising.

1:38:01.625 --> 1:38:02.625
A horde's coming.

1:38:03.208 --> 1:38:04.375
We have to depart!

1:38:16.291 --> 1:38:17.375
The money's here.

1:38:20.666 --> 1:38:21.666
Huh?

1:38:22.750 --> 1:38:24.291
It's not him.

1:38:25.750 --> 1:38:27.458
How many times did they switch?

1:38:30.375 --> 1:38:31.583
Nice to meet you...

1:38:32.208 --> 1:38:34.416
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you.

1:38:41.958 --> 1:38:45.000
Get rid of the body!

1:38:59.208 --> 1:39:02.666
Hey, stop!

1:39:12.666 --> 1:39:15.583
Get the money!

1:39:15.666 --> 1:39:18.583
Shut the back hatch! Zombies are coming!

1:39:51.208 --> 1:39:53.916
Grandpa...

1:39:56.625 --> 1:39:59.500
Okay, I'm okay...

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.250
Grandpa...

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:09.083
I wanted to pull you out of this hell...

1:40:12.333 --> 1:40:13.500
No...

1:40:14.958 --> 1:40:17.666
We were together all along.

1:40:19.125 --> 1:40:21.125
Why would this be hell?

1:40:23.166 --> 1:40:24.208
Thank you...

1:40:25.125 --> 1:40:27.041
Grandpa...

1:40:31.083 --> 1:40:32.708
Grandpa!

1:40:34.291 --> 1:40:35.750
I'm sorry...

1:40:37.250 --> 1:40:39.541
for making you live in this world...

1:40:39.916 --> 1:40:42.041
Grandpa...

1:40:43.666 --> 1:40:47.500
- Grandpa...
- I'm sorry...

1:40:47.750 --> 1:40:49.166
Grandpa.

1:40:54.750 --> 1:40:56.208
Grandpa!

1:41:01.333 --> 1:41:03.083
Don't die...

1:41:08.166 --> 1:41:10.875
Grandpa! No!

1:41:13.291 --> 1:41:14.833
Grandpa...

1:41:55.375 --> 1:41:57.083
Girls! The fireworks!

1:41:57.166 --> 1:41:58.208
Hurry!

1:41:59.666 --> 1:42:00.666
Joon-i!

1:42:07.250 --> 1:42:10.666
You promised to do a favor for me.

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.958
Take the girls with you no matter what.

1:42:15.791 --> 1:42:16.833
Got it?

1:42:17.166 --> 1:42:18.166
Promise me, okay?

1:42:18.916 --> 1:42:19.958
Get going!

1:42:20.750 --> 1:42:21.750
Now!

1:42:36.166 --> 1:42:39.291
Commander, thank you.

1:43:26.583 --> 1:43:28.833
Mom's falling behind!

1:44:30.916 --> 1:44:32.083
Are you all right?

1:44:32.291 --> 1:44:33.458
You're safe now!

1:44:37.208 --> 1:44:38.208
Jane...

1:44:38.291 --> 1:44:39.291
Jane!

1:44:39.375 --> 1:44:42.333
Jane! We have to save my mom!

1:44:42.416 --> 1:44:43.750
I'm sorry. It's too late!

1:44:43.833 --> 1:44:45.041
We can't put you in danger.

1:44:45.125 --> 1:44:46.208
We must leave now!

1:44:46.291 --> 1:44:49.041
Please, help my mom!

1:44:49.750 --> 1:44:51.250
Please! Just this once!

1:44:51.416 --> 1:44:52.416
Go! Let's go!

1:44:52.708 --> 1:44:53.708
Let's go!

1:44:53.791 --> 1:44:54.958
You must wait!

1:44:57.666 --> 1:44:58.708
Please...

1:45:00.291 --> 1:45:02.250
Remain calm...

1:45:12.625 --> 1:45:14.000
Don't wait for me...

1:45:38.291 --> 1:45:39.291
No...

1:45:40.708 --> 1:45:41.708
Mom!

1:45:41.791 --> 1:45:44.583
Don't do it, Mom!

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.041
Let go of me!

1:45:58.666 --> 1:45:59.666
Mom!

1:46:08.791 --> 1:46:10.416
Mom, please!

1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:21.291
She made a very sensible decision.

1:46:21.958 --> 1:46:25.833
It was for the best! For everyone...

1:46:26.958 --> 1:46:28.625
Sensible decision, my ass.

1:46:30.666 --> 1:46:31.833
Did you even try?

1:46:34.625 --> 1:46:35.625
Jung-seok...

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:38.500
You're tormented too!

1:46:40.208 --> 1:46:41.541
You just gave up!

1:46:41.625 --> 1:46:44.250
We have to save Mom!

1:46:51.208 --> 1:46:52.791
I'll bring back your mom.

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.208
Wait right here.

1:47:07.208 --> 1:47:09.416
Mom! Run!

1:48:40.458 --> 1:48:42.833
- Mom!
- Mom!

1:48:50.416 --> 1:48:51.416
Mom!

1:50:08.333 --> 1:50:11.166
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

1:50:15.916 --> 1:50:17.208
She'll be fine.

1:50:31.041 --> 1:50:33.750
In a few hours, a new world will be waiting.

1:50:35.541 --> 1:50:39.291
The world I knew wasn't bad either.
