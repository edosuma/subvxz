NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.378 --> 00:06.085
Because Merida has failed
to relinquish her crown,

00:06.173 --> 00:08.334
her brothers Will be executed.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.040
No!

00:13.847 --> 00:14.927
-Ki|| her!

Get us out of here.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.099

00:28.195 --> 00:29.776
Welcome home, Your Majesty.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.102
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:32.449 --> 00:34.906
Oh, does that hurt?
I can make it go away.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.113
I don't need any more
of your dark magic.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.284
Really?

00:38.372 --> 00:41.614
Would you rather I sent you back
to face Merlin and Emma on your own?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.615
My dark magic is what
allowed us to escape

00:43.710 --> 00:45.371
after you let them
take control of Excalibur.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.418
Because you spent the battle
pinned to a tree.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.376
Careful, or you'll wish
you'd never cut me loose.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.423
You think I wanna be working
with a villain like you?

00:52.469 --> 00:55.211
Like it or not, we still need each other.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.466
(LAUGHS) You mean
you need me to help you

00:57.558 --> 00:59.640
finish your pitiful quest
to restore Excalibur.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.557
Which I can use to destroy your sister

01:01.645 --> 01:04.762
so you can escape and give birth
to this precious child of yours.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.814
(SIGHS) What do you suggest?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.482
Because the combined power
of Merlin and the Dark One

01:09.570 --> 01:10.650
makes your knights useless.

01:10.737 --> 01:11.772
Not true.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.905
My knights will help us defeat our foes
if we give them the proper motivation.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.656
How far can your magic transport us?

01:19.746 --> 01:23.330
Far enough. Why?
Where do you want to go?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.159
There's something that could help us
in another land.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.581
A land called DunBroch.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.191
I did it, Dad.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.613
I saved the boys,

01:57.868 --> 02:01.031
and l proved to the Clans
that I am fit to be their queen.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.330
Well, I may have united
the Clans behind me,

02:09.379 --> 02:11.461
but now comes the hard part.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.833
Ruling over them.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.383
You always made it look so easy.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.300
Wish you were here
so I could ask you how you did it.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.563
He's always with you, Merida,

02:29.691 --> 02:31.556
even if it doesn't seem like it.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.194
I miss him, too.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.744
But today is not a day
to wallow in sadness.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.035
-Come.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.295
Show yourself, witch.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.209
There's no witch here.
Just a simple wood carver.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.089
You gave my daughter magic,

03:42.139 --> 03:44.721
turned my wife and boys into bears.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.797
You're a witch!

03:45.934 --> 03:49.301
Perhaps I dabble with magic.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.595
Good.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.316
'Cause I need some.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.278
Invaders are attacking from the south.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.613
If I'm to lead the Clans
to victory over them,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.653
I'm gonna need some magic.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.362
Mmm.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.075
Something to stop
invaders from the south.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.661
Something to ensure
the future of my kingdom.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.338
Yes, I can help you.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.834
But I must warn you,
it won't come cheap.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.258
Whatever your price is, I'll pay it.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.183
I'm not in need of anything right now.
Perhaps in the future.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.268
Call it an IOU.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.365
Very well.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.664
Then we have ourselves a deal.

Wear this helm into battle,
and you'll get exactly what you want.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.085
Aye.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.217
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

05:58.942 --> 06:03.777
On behalf of Clans Macintosh,
Dingwall, and MacGuffin,

06:03.905 --> 06:06.021
we freely give this crown.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.910
Then it is my honor to crown you,

06:18.962 --> 06:21.374
Merida of Clan DunBroch,

06:21.464 --> 06:24.376
as our true and rightful...

06:25.385 --> 06:28.297
Did you forget to invite me, dear?

06:29.806 --> 06:33.048
What are you doing here, witch?
Is this about the magic I took?

06:33.143 --> 06:36.977
No, I'm here because of
another happy customer of mine.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.311
King Fergus.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.639
Lies. My father would never
stoop so low.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.061
He did not stoop,
except to get through the door.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.065
But he did come for magic.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.565
An enchanted helm, to be exact.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.151
One that glistens like the sun.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.997
Merida, I'm afraid that is
your father's mark.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.747
Unfortunately, King Fergus died
before he could pay me what he owed.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.836
Um, with interest, 10,000 gold scats.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.170
(ALL WHISPERING)

07:09.012 --> 07:11.970
That much gold would
bankrupt the Clans three times over.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.803
If you don't have the gold,
you could simply return the helm.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.513
I can't return what I don't have.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.681
Then you best find it.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.021
If you don't return it
by sundown tomorrow,

07:22.108 --> 07:24.690
I'll have no choice
but to curse the entire kingdom.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.147
You wouldn't.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.313
One drop of this,

07:29.366 --> 07:33.154
and all your subjects
will live out the rest of their lives

07:33.703 --> 07:35.284

07:38.500 --> 07:40.957
Quiet! Keep your heads.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.876
Harder than it looks, dear.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.587
If you ever hope to wear that crown,

07:46.675 --> 07:50.884
you need to figure out
how to do what your father couldn't.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.131
Lead.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.145
It's got to be here somewhere.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.524
You won't find the helm here.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.401
I will, if you help me look.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.153
Check that sideboard.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.114
No, you won't find it
because it's not here.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.119
I packed that helm in Dad's trunk myself

08:22.210 --> 08:24.417
when we left to fight
the southern invaders.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.996
You mean, he was wearing that...

08:27.090 --> 08:28.375
When he was killed.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.264
What was the witch on about
when she said

08:42.355 --> 08:44.016
Dad didn't know how to lead?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.856
What do you think
the helm's magic did?

08:47.986 --> 08:51.695
Whatever it did, I'm sure Fergus had
good reason for needing it.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.451
But right now we have
a more pressing question.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.244
If the helm's lost, what are we
going to do about the witch?

08:59.330 --> 09:02.242
I didn't say it was lost,
I just said it wasn't here.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.620
You know where it is?

09:06.129 --> 09:07.994
After the knight killed Dad,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.546
he took the helm from him
right there in the battlefield.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.965
Whoever the killer is, he has the helm.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.635
No, Merida, absolutely not.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.679
I haven't even said anything yet!

09:18.767 --> 09:21.804
But I know what you're thinking.
You are not going after him.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.019
That knight already took
Fergus from me.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.482
I can't lose you too.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.184
If I don't figure out who he is
and where to find him,

09:30.278 --> 09:32.940
my entire kingdom will be doomed.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.771
He killed your father for that thing.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.323
He won't give it up without a fight.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.445
That's what I'm counting on,

09:38.536 --> 09:41.903
because this time my arrow won't miss.

to disrespect my daughter

Dad, it's all right,
I can look after myself.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.392
I'm afraid the front is a lot rougher
than you think, Merida.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.482
They can't be that rough if they're
writing their sweethearts back home.

I'm afraid this is it.

to carry it into your first battle.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.070
You're lucky I'm on your side,
because when I'm done with that girl,

15:05.154 --> 15:08.396
she'll wish that she
never left your prison cell.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.621
This is it.
This is where my dad met his end.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.329
What is it?

15:25.049 --> 15:28.212
This arrow, the fletching,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.337
I made it.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.794
And?

15:30.888 --> 15:31.923
You don't get it, do you?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.925
This is the arrow I fired on that day,

15:34.016 --> 15:35.426
the one thatjust missed
my father's killer.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.383
But you didn't miss his cloak.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.093
We can use this to find him.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.346
We're gonna make him pay
for what he did to my dad.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.149
Mourn on your own time.
We're wasting daylight. Let's go.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.316
What happened to you, Mulan?

15:46.404 --> 15:47.439
What do you mean?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.442
You knew Fergus too, but you're acting
like you never even met the man.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.568
Have you already forgotten our deal?

15:51.659 --> 15:52.694
No, I remember.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.156
But what kind of friend would I be
if I stuck to it?

15:56.247 --> 15:58.533
Why have you closed off
your heart like this?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.617
There's one lesson I didn't teach you
the last time we were here.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.704
A true warrior doesn't let
anything hurt them.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.634
(SWORDS CLANGING)

16:17.185 --> 16:18.721
(GRUNHNG)

16:19.812 --> 16:22.804
Not bad. Next lesson,
you never leave your flank open.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.608
I didn't.
Ijust wanted you to think I had.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.481
(LAUGHING) You're learning.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.689
Fighting isn't about who's stronger.
It's about who's smarter.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.280
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:39.832 --> 16:43.791
Look, fellas, our queen-to-be
knocked over her nursemaid.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.128
Too bad there'll not be any Iassies
for you to fight on the battlefield.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.706
Why? Are you not gonna be there?

16:49.800 --> 16:50.960
Merida, it's not worth it.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.212
Why not?

16:52.303 --> 16:54.214
I could kick his ass in front of everyone.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.591
And that's being strong, not smart.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.843
No one's gonna follow you out of fear.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.766
What will make them follow me?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.344
These are your people, not mine.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.897
If you don't know,
you should ask someone who does.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.724
Someone who they're already following.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.808
(CHEERING)

17:15.952 --> 17:17.237
MERIDA: I love my dad,

17:19.330 --> 17:20.820
and I won't give up until he has justice.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.791
Look, if we find a weaver, they can
tell us where this fabric was made.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.118
Wait.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.419
Someone's coming.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.173
That's a clever little trick,
but not clever enough.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.719
Oh, come now, you wouldn't attack
a mother-to-be, now, would you?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.430
Arthur, what are you doing here?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.686
I'm not going back to your dungeon,
if that's what you're thinking.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.638
You really think I'd come all the way
to this wretched place

17:47.733 --> 17:49.234
just to drag you back to Camelot?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.230
We're here for something else, dear.
Your father's helm.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.697
You with the witch?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.237
Why does everybody want
that bloody helmet?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.360
It's the only way
I'll ever save my kingdom.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.786
So, has the witch threatened to
turn your people into bears too?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.864
You don't even know
what the helm does, do you?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.837
It has the power to make other men
fight your battles,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.206
however dangerous they may be.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.088
You're a liar. That can't be.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.210
It is.

18:14.302 --> 18:17.715
It's the only way I'll ever get my knights
to stand up to Merlin and the Dark One.

18:18.389 --> 18:22.758
No. My dad would never use magic
to force people to fight for him.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.639
Aw! Apparently, Daddy dearest wasn't
the great king that you thought he was.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.557
Back off.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.734
We need that helm to stop the witch
from cursing this land.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.729
I'm afraid you're gonna have to find
some other way to do that.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.105
ZELENA: And who will even notice?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.482
These people are
practically animals already.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.690
Even if we wanted to give it to you,
we can't.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.899
We don't have it.

18:39.994 --> 18:43.111
Perhaps you don't, but we will.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.706
That belonged to my father!

18:47.793 --> 18:50.284
I know, and with a simple Iocator spell,

18:50.379 --> 18:52.370
it will lead us to another
one of his possessions.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.580
The helm.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.462
No. But that bow was the last thing
he ever gave me.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.215
Aw! Then you'll have to console yourself
with memories,

19:00.306 --> 19:04.219
and the knowledge of what
a terrible ruler he turned out to be.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.257
(LAUGHS)

19:06.187 --> 19:07.347
Ta-ta.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.855
Where are you going?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.356
Where do you think? Home.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.904
Well, don't. There's no need.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.527
They may have your bow,
but we have this.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.108
We'll find that helm first.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.618
It's not about how
we find the helm.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.820
It's about what
the helm's magic does.

19:25.915 --> 19:26.950
Why does that matter?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.497
Well, 'cause now I understand
what the witch meant

19:30.503 --> 19:32.869
And if he can't do it without magic,
how can I?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.166
-Merida...
-No!

19:35.257 --> 19:38.169
My father used dark magic to lead
innocent men to their deaths,

19:38.260 --> 19:39.545
and he paid the price for it.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.626
He died too.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.681
I'm not gonna make
the rest of the kingdom suffer

19:42.765 --> 19:44.255
just to prove I could do
what he couldn't.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.634
So you're gonna let the witch
curse DunBroch?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.435
No, I'm gonna do
what I should've from the start.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.060
Tell Macintosh and the rest of the lords
I can't find the helm,

19:53.150 --> 19:56.062
give them enough time to get it
before the witch turns us all into bears.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.405
Those lords can't even find
the pointy end of their spears.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.275
Well, they still stand a better chance
than I ever will.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.857
You cannot give up like this.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.692
Why not? You have.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.239
Or is there another reason you're
out here working for the highest bidder?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.287

20:32.732 --> 20:35.940
I wanted to stand watch for myself.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.358
The invaders will be sailing in
any day now.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.937
Do you think we'll win the war?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.942
We'll give them everything we got.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.737
What is it, daughter?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.282
I can tell something's on your mind.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.750
Mulan's a right good teacher,

20:51.834 --> 20:53.950
but there's one thing she can't teach me
about leading this army.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.079
And what might that be?

20:55.171 --> 20:58.334
How to inspire the Clans
to follow me into battle.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.837
How do you do it?

21:02.928 --> 21:06.967
How have you inspired all these men
to follow you into battle?

21:07.057 --> 21:10.049
Especially when so many of them
know they're gonna die.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.605
Dad.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.108
Is everything all right?

21:21.155 --> 21:22.144
Aye.

21:23.657 --> 21:28.526
There's only one way to get men
to follow you into a deadly battle,

21:29.997 --> 21:34.206
and that's by showing them
you're the first one willing to die.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.581
'Cause if their king
is willing to lay down his life,

21:37.671 --> 21:40.458
they know just how important
winning the battle is.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.665
Is that really what you're gonna do?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.421
You don't have to worry about me, lass.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.595
I'm the Bear King. I faced Mor'du.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.639
I can handle whatever
the southern invaders throw at us.

21:52.853 --> 21:57.973
Now, unless you want them to slip by,
I best keep my eye on the sea.

You're not the first person I've met
who a witch turned into an animal.

Hmm. Yeah, well, wolfing out
is kind of my thing,

24:00.648 --> 24:03.185

to put me under her thrall.

Are you Mulan?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.813
Yes. Have we met?

24:10.908 --> 24:12.990
No, but my friends told me about you.

Phillip and Aurora?

24:16.747 --> 24:21.912
Mary Margaret and Emma,
but I know Phillip and Aurora.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.163
I was in the other land with them.

24:24.254 --> 24:27.621
Last I saw, they were doing great.
They're about to have a child.

Did I say something?

24:33.764 --> 24:34.844
No, I'm fine.

It's just I know how difficult it is,
traveling between realms.

Look, ever since we got back
to Storybrooke,

25:39.830 --> 25:43.698
I feel like I haven't fit in.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.249
And at first I thought it was
because of the curse,

25:46.336 --> 25:48.042
but now that it's been broken, I...

25:48.130 --> 25:50.667
Because you're the only one
of your kind here.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.676
Maybe. I don't know, I...

25:56.638 --> 25:57.764
(SIGHS)

25:57.806 --> 25:59.421
Yeah, probably.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.057
I just...
I want to find more people like me.

26:05.397 --> 26:09.390
So I've been helping Tiny
work on his burnt-out fields.

26:09.485 --> 26:13.694
Back when we thought we were
gonna have to escape Zelena.

26:13.781 --> 26:18.320
And we haven't had much luck,
but we did manage to grow this.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.368
You want to go back
to the enchanted forest.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.495
Please don't try to stop me.
I know you think I'm crazy...

26:30.464 --> 26:32.671
I think you need to do
what makes you happy.

(SIGHS)

26:34.968 --> 26:36.583
Really?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.554
You are my friend. What else
could I possibly want for you?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.886
It doesn't mean
I'm not gonna miss you.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.886
Not as much as I'll miss you.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.315
And did you find
what you were looking for here?

26:52.402 --> 26:53.812
No.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.192
My pack, the others like me, were gone.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.317
There's no trace of them.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.110
So I went to the witch for help.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.160
And that's when she turned you
into her guard dog.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.825
Thank you for freeing me.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.991
At least my visit helped someone.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.125
Why exactly were you there?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.459
I set a bad example for an old friend.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.462
I wanted to find a way
to make things right.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.798
I thought the witch might have
some magic

27:19.888 --> 27:23.176
that would help us track down the man
who killed my friend's father.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.633
That belonged to him?

27:26.186 --> 27:27.722
Yes.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.851
You don't need magic
to hunt the killer down.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.980
Come on, let's go help your friend.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.278
You can't seriously be considering
giving the crown to him.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.906
It's the only way to ensure we won't
all end up under the witch's curse.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.952
I think I'd rather be a bear again
than bow down to Clan Macintosh.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.122
Mum!

27:51.461 --> 27:53.668
If you can find the helm
before the witch's deadline,

27:54.923 --> 27:56.424
the crown is yours.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.509
Don't hand it overjust yet.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.306
You were right, Merida.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.895
I gave up and I was wrong.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.094
But so were you.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.180
We're gonna find the knight
that ran Fergus through.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.559
-How?
-I brought a friend.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.395
I'm gonna sniff him out.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.525
(GROANS)

28:25.787 --> 28:27.288
Have you already forgotten
everything I taught you?

28:27.372 --> 28:31.035
(GROANS) Why do we have to start
before the rooster's even crowed?

28:31.376 --> 28:32.365
(BAGPIPES AND DRUMS PLAYING)

28:35.214 --> 28:36.203
The invaders.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.298
You brought me out here
to keep me from the fight.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.591
Dad put you up to it, didn't he?

28:41.678 --> 28:42.667
Merida...

28:42.763 --> 28:43.798
Out of my way.

28:44.806 --> 28:45.795

We're not ashamed of who we are!

29:29.017 --> 29:32.680

29:32.771 --> 29:35.979

30:33.206 --> 30:34.616
Dad!

30:35.959 --> 30:37.369
Fergus!

30:50.849 --> 30:51.838
(GROANS)

30:57.272 --> 30:58.261
No.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.697
No!

31:17.376 --> 31:18.866
-Dad!
-Stop.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.253
Are you certain the helm's here?

31:31.348 --> 31:34.055
Well, this is where
Daddy DunBroch's bow says it is.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.056
(CHUCKLES)

31:44.569 --> 31:46.651
When will you learn
to stop doubting me, dear?

31:50.951 --> 31:52.361
That doesn't belong to you.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.530
You don't know when to give up.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.909
Where is he?
Where's the man who killed my dad?

31:57.999 --> 32:01.958
That's him. He killed Fergus.
His scent is all over this cloak.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.086
You?

32:06.466 --> 32:08.206
You're the one?

32:09.302 --> 32:12.590
I led my knights on a quest to find
the missing piece of Excalibur.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.387
We heard rumor
of magic in these lands,

32:14.474 --> 32:16.851
so I landed here in the hopes
I could finally complete my sword.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.473
So it's true. You killed my father.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.395
A knight does what he must
on the battlefield.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.517
You're gonna get yourself killed.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.643
She isn't the only one.

32:24.734 --> 32:25.814
This isn't about revenge.

32:25.902 --> 32:29.861
This is about you finding the helm
and saving your people.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.657
But if you're the one who killed my dad,
why don't you have the helm?

32:33.743 --> 32:35.449
I saw you take if off him
with my own eyes.

32:35.537 --> 32:38.995
Because the helm Fergus was wearing
when he died wasn't enchanted.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.117
What?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.744
It was a piece of iron
polished to a shine.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.951
When I put it on to rally my men,
it didn't do anything.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.376
We lost the battle.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.255
Dad must've thrown the helm he got
from the witch into the sea

32:48.341 --> 32:49.672
before the battle began.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.260
And you know what this means, right?

32:52.053 --> 32:54.180
He didn't use magic
to lead the troops into battle.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.176
They followed him
because they believed in him.

32:57.726 --> 33:01.560
Oh, as touching as this family drama is,
we need the helm.

33:02.689 --> 33:06.022
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to
stop you from leaving DunBroch with it.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.690
My people are counting on me.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.984
And so are mine.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.936
I've already killed DunBroch's king.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.489
Now it looks like
I'll have to kill its queen.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.916
You have no idea of
the dark path you sent me down.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.585
I've been down plenty of my own.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.378
It's the burden of wearing a crown.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.957
I blamed myself for my dad's death
when I really should've blamed you.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.462
I'm notjust gonna keep you
from getting the helm.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.547
I'm gonna make you pay
for what you did to him.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.260
Don't take another step.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.390
This isn't your battle.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.063
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.435
You don't scare me.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.235
Sleeping powder. Clever.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.700
She used it on me.
How do you like it now, witch?

33:59.788 --> 34:01.403
Hurry, it won't last long.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.951
(GRUNHNG)

34:08.838 --> 34:09.873
I need that helm

34:09.965 --> 34:13.628
to get Excalibur
and fulfill my destiny as Camelot's king.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.291
(YELLS)

34:19.891 --> 34:21.472
Reach for it,

34:21.560 --> 34:24.427
and I will cut you down
just like your father.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.187
Make another move,

34:28.275 --> 34:30.391
and you'll look like a porcupine.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.852
This time one of those arrows is
bound to hit more than just your cloak.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.068
(SIGHS) Where is that bloody witch
when I need her?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.911
MULAN: She's sleeping on the job.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.624
Even your magic can't stop
all these arrows.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.287
Seems we need to find some
other means of retrieving Excalibur.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.883
Yes, but perhaps that's a discussion
best held in Camelot.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.728
Thank you.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.894
All of you.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.405
I wouldn't have had the helm
if it wasn't for you.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.616
We couldn't let our queen fall.

35:26.708 --> 35:30.326
After all this, you still want me
to be your queen?

35:31.671 --> 35:34.788
You were willing to give up your crown
for the good of the kingdom,

35:34.883 --> 35:37.249
give up your life to get that helm.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.262
I only ever saw one person
make a sacrifice like that,

35:42.349 --> 35:43.805
and it was your father.

35:46.311 --> 35:50.896
If you're not fit to lead the Clans,
no one is.

protector of the Highlands,
and my daughter.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.033
(CHEERING)

36:14.673 --> 36:15.958
You're early.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.880
The sun's nearly set.

36:17.967 --> 36:21.209
Unless you want to rule over
a kingdom of bears,

36:21.304 --> 36:22.589
you'd better have my helm.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.514
Oh, I have it,
but I'm not gonna hand it over to you.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.258
I'm going to destroy it.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.137
Are you sure that's wise, dear?

36:33.191 --> 36:34.180
Merida...

36:34.275 --> 36:36.266
I know what I'm doing, Mother.

36:37.529 --> 36:41.113
No one should have the power to lead
people into a fight they don't believe in.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.982
I'll find a way to stop your curse,

36:44.077 --> 36:47.114
but I am not going to be
bullied into giving this back.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.079
I was hoping you'd say that.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.576
What, now?

36:51.668 --> 36:54.535
This was never about the helm, dear.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.711
This was about you.

36:57.799 --> 37:00.541
You mean this was all a test?

37:00.635 --> 37:03.001
King Fergus came to me
asking for magic

37:03.096 --> 37:07.180
to ensure the future of his kingdom,
and that's exactly what I gave him.

37:07.976 --> 37:11.264
Getting the helm back made me
understand what it takes to rule.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.972
Your magic's never very direct, is it?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.476
It gets the job done.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.234
I pride myself on satisfied customers.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.107
-Are we done then?
-Not quite.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.611
I wouldn't have come to
a coronation without a gift.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.613
It's not another carving of a bear, is it?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.282
A bear.

37:30.373 --> 37:34.867
There's one person who could not be
here today to see you crowned.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.667
My dad.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.378
What's that?

37:43.470 --> 37:44.585
Magical ale.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.629
You know the legend of Seonaidh,
don't you, dear?

37:47.724 --> 37:49.885
Aye. Is it true?

37:49.976 --> 37:51.341
Indeed.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.178
One cup of this can summon
the spirit of anyone

37:54.272 --> 37:56.137
who's passed to the underworld.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.064
You mean I can talk to my dad?

38:04.199 --> 38:05.564
Thank you.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.283

Long live Queen Merida!

38:09.370 --> 38:10.405
(CHEERING)

38:28.389 --> 38:29.765
Thank you.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.716
If it weren't for the two of you,
I'd have let my whole kingdom down.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.099
And if it weren't for you, I'd still be
shaking down thugs in a tavern.

38:36.189 --> 38:39.522
I'd still be licking my chops
in that witch's cottage.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.478
Here.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.734
It wouldn't be honorable
for me to keep this.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.485
Does this mean I can finally ask
what happened before I found you?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.541
Well, if you must know,

38:56.459 --> 38:58.495
I was trying to get over a broken heart.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.955
I waited too long to tell someone
how I felt about them.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.334
And when I finally
worked up the courage,

39:08.888 --> 39:10.469
it was too late.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.139
I'm sorry, Mulan.

39:13.226 --> 39:17.686
You know, I might not be the best
person to ask for dating advice.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.354
I kind of ate the only boyfriend
I've ever had.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.477
Yes, I think that disqualifies you.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.276
But maybe I can help.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.565
Come with me.
It might do you some good.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.024
Searching for werewolves?

39:31.119 --> 39:33.360
It's better than wallowing in self-pity.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.824
-I don't wallow.
-(SCOFFS)

39:38.626 --> 39:42.995
Look, maybe helping someone else
find their path will help you with yours.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.247
Thank you.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.880
Well, good luck.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.051
-Dad.
-Merida.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.975
You did it. You became Queen.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.023
I'm sorry.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.771
For what?

40:47.862 --> 40:50.274
I lost faith in you.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.778
I thought you used the enchanted helm
to lead your troops into battle.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.483
It's all right.

40:55.578 --> 40:59.537
I lost faith in myself
when I went to the witch for that helm.

40:59.624 --> 41:03.867
Why didn't you use it?
What made you change your mind?

41:03.962 --> 41:07.250
You did, the night before the battle.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.291
After I spoke to you, I realized...

41:11.386 --> 41:14.219
If I wanted to show you
what it took to be a leader,

41:14.305 --> 41:15.966
I couldn't use magic to do it.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.547
Aye.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.634
You showed me what a true leader is,

41:20.728 --> 41:22.810
and I will never forget that.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.897
Ijust wanna make you proud, Dad.
