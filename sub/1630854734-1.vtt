00:56.724 --> 00:59.360
- You're gonna
miss this, Juanito.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.694
- I know.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.862
- I am having lots
of second thoughts.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.697
- Nah, you're doing the
right thing, though.

01:03.731 --> 01:04.532
- I hope so.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.866
- Of course you are, man.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.068
- I know, but
working at a desk?

01:08.102 --> 01:09.203
I mean...

01:09.237 --> 01:10.538
- So you guys pick out

01:10.571 --> 01:12.206
a name yet, or-
- You're wasting your time.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.207
It's not gonna be Tony.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.408
- Come on, man!

01:14.442 --> 01:16.744
I mean, Tony, that
is a good-ass name.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.078
I mean, not only you got,

01:18.112 --> 01:19.547
you got Uncle Tony here,

01:19.580 --> 01:22.550
you also got Sir
Anthony Hopkins.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.551
- Hannibal Lecter?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.552
- Shit, yeah!

01:24.585 --> 01:25.719
- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.920
- Well, I mean,
you know he's not

01:26.954 --> 01:28.055
actually Hannibal,
though, right?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.223
- I mean, ask anyone.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.724
Say, "Hey, y'all know
Anthony Hopkins?",

01:30.758 --> 01:33.227
and it'll be like, "Oh,
the dude who eats people?"

01:33.261 --> 01:34.395
Shit!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.564
- All right, well, what
about Marc Anthony?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.398
- Idiot.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.267
Divorced J-Lo, bad move.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.569
- I meant the other,
the other Marc Antony.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.070
- He killed
himself, didn't he?

01:43.103 --> 01:43.904
- Oh, fuck it!

01:43.937 --> 01:44.772
What's it gonna be?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.440
- Juan Jose Ortado Moreno III.

01:46.474 --> 01:50.578
- Fuckin' hell, man!

01:50.611 --> 01:51.745
- No, it's Juan Junior.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.581
- Jeez, that's such a
lack of imagination!

01:53.614 --> 01:55.583
- It's my name, man,
and my dad's name.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.751
- Yeah, but how many Juans do
we need in the world, right?

01:57.785 --> 01:58.919
- Just Juan.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.255
Like Juan Two and
Juan Three?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.625
Man, I can't believe we
have this calvary behind

02:04.658 --> 02:06.594
for such a small-time bust.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.096
It's over the top,
if you ask me.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.631
These guys are small-timers.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.099
- Gotta take out
the small-timers

02:12.132 --> 02:14.635
before they become
big-timers, right?

02:14.668 --> 02:15.769
- Right.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.471
- Now, you sit and
stay here, all right?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.472
- Fuck you!

02:55.008 --> 02:55.809
- Be right back.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.644
- Hey, don't say that.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.845
It's bad luck.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.012
I still need you to
pay for the baptism.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.681
- Yeah, are we done here?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.316
People got responsibilities,
important jobs to do.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.151
Just leave it to the pros.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.153
- Yeah, get
the fuck outta here.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.841
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

03:27.875 --> 03:28.676
- Ándele!

03:28.709 --> 03:29.677
Rápido, rápido!

03:36.717 --> 03:37.518
- Atención!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.353
Esta es la DEA!

03:39.387 --> 03:41.221
- Ándele! Andele!

04:57.465 --> 04:58.799
- No, Fernando's not here yet.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.974
No!

05:10.478 --> 05:11.979
- No, no, no,
.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.458
- Get up.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
Let's go.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.510
- Is everything okay?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.147
Your mom's gonna
say no either way.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.696
- Cover me!

06:10.037 --> 06:11.004
Fucker!

06:17.878 --> 06:19.179
Heads up in the alley!

06:19.212 --> 06:20.180
- Well, I like the two bedroom.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.381
Why don't we get that one?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.518
Okay.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.553
Freeze!

06:25.586 --> 06:26.854
Drop your weapon!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.191
- Shit!

06:35.896 --> 06:36.530
- Oh, my god!

06:36.564 --> 06:38.198
Oh, my god!

06:38.231 --> 06:39.533
Juan!

06:39.567 --> 06:41.535
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my god!

06:41.569 --> 06:42.870
- No, no, no, no, Juan!
- Oh, my god!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.037
- Fuckin' A.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.205
I need some help!

06:46.574 --> 06:47.708
- Oh, my god!
- Come on, man!

06:47.741 --> 06:48.542
Just don't!

06:48.576 --> 06:49.877
Don't you fuckin' do this to me!

06:49.910 --> 06:50.911
Come on, man!

06:50.944 --> 06:51.712
I know!

06:51.745 --> 06:52.713
Fuck!

06:55.949 --> 06:56.784
Fuck, man!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.720
I need some help!

07:01.755 --> 07:04.224
Come on, man!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.092
Fuck, man!

07:06.126 --> 07:07.561
Jesus Christ!

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
I'm so sorry, man!

07:54.508 --> 07:55.643
- Oh, my god!

07:57.010 --> 07:58.612
I don't believe it!

07:58.646 --> 08:00.781
- Hi, Nick!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.950
- How the hell did you find me?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.285
- It wasn't easy, but then
again, it wasn't that difficult.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.453
Permission to come aboard, sir?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.622
- Permission granted.
- Yeah, thank you.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.290
- Care for a libation?
- Always!

08:13.493 --> 08:14.327
Whoo!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.631
So this is what retirement
in Mexico looks like?

08:17.665 --> 08:20.300
- Yeah, it's my house, I guess.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.804
I'm trying to remember,

08:23.837 --> 08:24.972
was that with water, or...

08:25.005 --> 08:26.173
Just a little

08:26.206 --> 08:27.975
ice in there, that's fine.
- All right.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.677
- Yeah!

08:31.011 --> 08:32.980
I could get used to
this very easily.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.315
- Yo!

08:35.348 --> 08:36.516
Oh, salut then.
- Salut.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.890
It's good to see you, Nick.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.192
Yeah.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.228
This isn't a social visit, Nick.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.166
I have three black warrants
I need you to execute.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
- Maybe you didn't get the hints

08:55.235 --> 08:57.504
because of my formal attire,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.872
but I am retired.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.909
- Your country needs you.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.178
- Oh, Francis!

09:05.212 --> 09:07.180
You don't get it, do you?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.016
I mean, do you know
what my day is like?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.518
And I'd say, pretty
much every day.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.855
I get up in the
morning, I take a pee,

09:14.888 --> 09:17.057
then I eat breakfast,
take a shit,

09:18.225 --> 09:20.027
possibly go into town.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.030
The afternoon, I like
to grab a little siesta.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.566
And then at the end of
the day, a cocktail,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.535
just like the one I'm
enjoying right now.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.536
- And that's the
way you'd like to

09:29.569 --> 09:30.738
spend the rest of your days?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.040
- Well, I wouldn't
mind getting laid

09:33.073 --> 09:34.374
a little bit more often,

09:34.407 --> 09:37.377
but yeah, that's pretty much it.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.912
- We have a mole in the agency.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.049
- Oh.
- By the time we

09:42.082 --> 09:43.216
clear everybody
it'll be too late.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.452
That's why we need you,
and we need you now.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.889
I got $600,000 in this bag.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.590
That's $200,000 a warrant.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.229
Imminent danger.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.898
We've got three, four days tops.

10:07.474 --> 10:08.742
- Let me get my readers.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.245
- You must really be retired?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.280
- Yes, I am.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.092
You folks must really
be up against the wall.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.126
- We are.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.462
Yeah, it's nice!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.003
- Bin Farri?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.639
My god, that was 25 years ago!

10:39.673 --> 10:40.607
What is this?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.109
- Well, you know,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.311
after everything went down
in Miami the way it did,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.478
he was untouchable.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.446
Too high profile.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.981
We couldn't go after him again.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.150
Well, he's reappeared on the
radar with something very bad.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.123
Nick, before you say anything,

10:56.156 --> 10:57.958
I gotta let you
know, if you say no,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.159
well, there's a good chance

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
that you might be
exposed about Miami.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.130
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:03.163 --> 11:04.464
It's not me.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.332
You know I wouldn't do
something like that.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.633
It's those guys.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
They can't take a
chance on you saying no.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.002
That's why they sent me.

11:09.036 --> 11:09.970
They know we're friends.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.304
- Oh, some friend you are!

11:11.338 --> 11:12.973
- You've got a lot
of balls sayin' that.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.141
- Huh?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.143
- After everything
I did for your son?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.310
The son you abandoned?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.146
If that doesn't
prove our friendship,

11:19.179 --> 11:20.647
I don't know what does.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.815
What the hell kinda thing
is that to say to me?

11:21.849 --> 11:23.316
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Look-

11:23.350 --> 11:24.484
Okay, yeah.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.153
Well, don't think I'm
enjoying bein' here

11:26.186 --> 11:27.520
layin' all this shit on ya!

11:29.689 --> 11:31.158
Nick, I wouldn't be here

11:31.191 --> 11:33.526
if this wasn't a situation
of national security.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.865
- And who's
the other guy?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.833
- Oh, that's Polat, the Turk.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.334
You take him out,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.837
and, well, Bin Farri's whole
money laundering scheme

11:43.871 --> 11:44.704
goes to hell.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.207
And this guy's some character.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.878
He has a large appetite
for 12-year-old girls.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.847
12-year-old girls
turned prostitutes

11:53.881 --> 11:55.515
by Bin Farri and his people.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.383
- Jesus!

12:00.888 --> 12:03.356
This one?
- That's Mustafar.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.524
He introduced Bin Farri

12:04.557 --> 12:06.860
to a number of
terrorist organizations.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.029
We have confirmation that
they have a cargo shipment

12:09.062 --> 12:10.230
comin' in to Mexico.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.100
We believe it's
biological weapons.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.702
Yeah.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.204
This is serious.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.071
- Well...

12:19.239 --> 12:20.040
- Come on, buddy.

12:20.073 --> 12:20.908
You can do this.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.912
It'll be like old times.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.548
And I'll tell you what,

12:28.581 --> 12:30.050
if they ask you to do
anything after this,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.885
I promise you I'll tell
'em to go fuck themselves.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.253
- Oh!
- I will!

12:33.286 --> 12:34.221
And I'll quit.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.222
- Ho-ho!
- I will!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.723
I'll quit, and I'll come,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.559
and, well, I'll live with
you on this floating mansion.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.794
I'll be your first mate.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.763
What do you say?

12:43.797 --> 12:47.134
- Frankie, if you do
that, remember this.

12:48.135 --> 12:52.072
Out at sea, I am in command.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.774
- Aye aye, Captain.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.619
- Hey, man.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.924
I would encourage you to
ask for a permanent transfer

13:10.958 --> 13:12.325
to another field office.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.428
- I'm good.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.496
- You sure?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.432
Okay.
- What do you got for me?

13:19.466 --> 13:24.471
- So San Mar was
bought five months ago.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.607
They import chandeliers from
China and all their parts.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.808
They assemble them,

13:30.477 --> 13:33.113
then wholesale them
to distributors all
around the country.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.281
Papers are straight.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.116
They're clean as a whistle.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.617
- The shooter?

13:37.650 --> 13:42.122
- Confirmed to be Zacarias
Zapata, a.k.a. Zico.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.491
He was locked up in El
Hongo, last I heard,

13:44.524 --> 13:47.961
but somebody must have paid
lots of money to get him out.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.963
- You're telling me

13:49.997 --> 13:52.799
there are no bad apples
in that entire barrel?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.001
Come on!

13:54.034 --> 13:56.303
- No one seems to
know who Zico is.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.971
They're probably lying,

13:58.005 --> 14:00.507
but I would, if I was
them, too, you know?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.843
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.313
- What is it?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.647
- Polat.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.815
- Polat?

14:08.848 --> 14:09.983
- Yeah.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.484
- Who
the hell's Polat?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.819
- The manager.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.321
He's the only non-Mexican there.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.855
I don't know, somethin'
just rubbed me

14:15.889 --> 14:18.158
the wrong way about him,
so I ran his prints.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.342
I was about to come find you.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.209
Come here.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.012
- I know.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.513
I heard it.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.514
- What do you mean?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.551
- I was on the phone with him.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.353
- Jesus!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.687
- I heard everything.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.356
- I'm so sorry.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.706
- Two fucking hours!

15:08.275 --> 15:09.409
- What?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.710
- I've been waiting
for two hours

15:10.743 --> 15:11.878
to take a piss.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.547
- Sorry, it's been busy here.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.715
- I didn't shoot anyone.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.717
I don't know who that guy was.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.386
I never saw that person
in my entire life.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.720
- Just shut the fuck up.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.788
Yeah?
- Jesus!

15:23.423 --> 15:26.893
- So what do you do for San Mar?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.962
- I manage the
shipping and receiving.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.598
- You wanna try that again?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.134
Polat?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.570
- Polat.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.072
Who is that?

15:39.106 --> 15:42.742
- FBI, Interpol, Europol,
Turkish Intelligence.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.245
Shit, man, you got warrants
out from all of them!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.247
How long you been
on the run, hmm?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.748
- It's been a while.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.250
- Money laundering,
though, that's...

15:50.283 --> 15:51.418
It's good business.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.420
- Until someone gets pissed off,

15:53.453 --> 15:56.289
or you get caught, like this.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.124
I get it!

15:57.157 --> 15:59.092
I'm in shit!

15:59.126 --> 16:00.593
Okay!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.629
Listen.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.797
This is going to be
like Christmas for you.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.436
Okay, I'm going to give you
exactly who you really want.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.803
- Oh, yeah?

16:10.837 --> 16:12.972
And who do we really want?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.144
- You make me a deal,

16:17.177 --> 16:20.480
and I will give you
Hussein Bin Farri.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.119
- Now who the fuck is that?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.620
- You don't know
Hussein Bin Farri?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.788
- No.
- No, we don't know.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.457
- Are you fucking with me?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.991
Do you live in a cave?

16:32.025 --> 16:35.495
- There is Rashida Bin Farri
at the new cultural center.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.796
Nice woman.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.466
- No, no, no, no,
that's the niece.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.800
She is...

16:40.833 --> 16:41.801
Nevermind!

16:41.834 --> 16:43.803
This guy, he's a
terrorist, okay?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.672
- Okay, what the fuck is
this guy talking about?

16:45.705 --> 16:46.839
- Hey, gringo!

16:46.873 --> 16:48.475
You've heard of Bin Laden, yeah?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.642
- Yeah.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.477
- You think Bin Laden
was a terrorist?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.478
- Yeah.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.679
- This guy says to Bin Laden,

16:52.712 --> 16:55.648
"Hey, Osama, get the
fuck out of my way!"

16:55.682 --> 16:57.650
- Okay.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.653
- So señor, if I was you,

17:00.687 --> 17:04.824
I would pay careful attention
to everything I have to say.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.527
But first, we talk deal.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.999
Then I give you everything
about the operation.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.667
- What operation?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.035
- You fucking people!

17:17.704 --> 17:20.673
I will give you a
very small hint, okay?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.376
Unless you do
something to stop him,

17:24.877 --> 17:29.048
Bin Farri is going to level
the United States economy.

17:29.082 --> 17:33.052
And then any country that has
extra cash laying around, hmm?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
- Are you talking about a bomb?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.893
- Better.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.530
They have some
fancy-schmancy machine.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.533
It was unloading when you
guys made your freaky scene.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.902
- You talkin' about
that van outside?

17:49.936 --> 17:51.371
I don't know.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.705
Those guys, they were
just unloadin' somethin'.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.873
They were all clean.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.042
They were unloading a
chandelier or some shit.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.410
- A chandelier, huh?
- Yeah.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.712
- Can a chandelier turn
off a whole country?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.881
Because this one does!

18:01.914 --> 18:03.250
- What are you talking about?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.717
Turn off a country?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.220
- No more until
you make me a deal.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.557
As example of good
faith negotiation,

18:10.590 --> 18:13.226
I will give you all the goods

18:13.260 --> 18:15.094
on Bin Farri's shell companies

18:15.128 --> 18:17.063
where he launders his money.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.566
I just need access to my laptop.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.933
- This guy sounds like a snake,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.069
just willing to
give up his boss.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.937
- Yeah, well, under
these circumstances,

18:24.971 --> 18:28.241
I'm entitled to go through
a selfish phase, no?

18:29.476 --> 18:30.577
- I need some water.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.445
You want some water?
- Yeah.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.080
- I still need to piss.

18:35.282 --> 18:35.948
But sure, okay,

18:35.982 --> 18:36.949
I'll take some water,

18:36.983 --> 18:38.918
but it has to be
sparkling water.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.920
Perrier, Pellegrino,
something like that.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.922
- I'll send someone
to take you to piss.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.592
- I don't
trust the water here.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.633
- So Agent Vanowen...

18:55.302 --> 18:56.102
- Fuck,
I gotta take a piss!

18:56.135 --> 18:56.969
Come on!

18:57.970 --> 18:58.971
- What do you think?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.610
- I mean, shit.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.811
Gotta call the FBI.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.280
- Hey, you guys!

19:07.314 --> 19:09.616
You may wanna let the FBI
know about this, huh?!

19:09.649 --> 19:12.452
This shit is going
to blow their minds!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.187
They'll give me a
better deal, huh?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.456
Hello?!

19:16.489 --> 19:17.957
Hello?!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.659
- I swear.
- Also,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.160
when you extradite me,

19:21.194 --> 19:23.463
and I'm sure you're going
to want to extradite me,

19:23.496 --> 19:28.501
I want a nice suite in
a flashy boutique hotel.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.637
- All right, I'll call the FBI.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.838
- Yeah.
- Okay?

19:33.039 --> 19:36.509
Tell them I want a
total immunity agreement

19:36.543 --> 19:38.144
approved by my attorney.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.011
He's in Texas.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.147
I'll give you the number.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.482
Are you there?!

19:42.515 --> 19:43.483
I have to piss!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.818
- Yeah, go fuck yourself!

20:40.239 --> 20:43.109
- Vanowen.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.077
Yes, sir.

21:09.135 --> 21:09.969
- Nick.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.107
Roger that.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.743
Oh.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.245
You got a room number?

22:05.358 --> 22:08.628
All before noon?

22:08.661 --> 22:09.996
Muí bien.

22:15.034 --> 22:15.968
Eh?

22:18.371 --> 22:20.973
No, we don't want
.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.510
No, no, no, no.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.202
Let's make it an even 200.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.708
- Gracias.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.409
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?

23:30.443 --> 23:32.244
- So the Turk wasn't lying.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.046
- FBI got their
panties in a bunch.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.081
I gotta take him to the border.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.082
- When?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.249
- Right now.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.251
- Well, he's technically
not been detained,

23:39.285 --> 23:41.721
so basically, you're
taking him for a car ride.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.556
- Yeah, the FBI, they'll
pick him up there.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.724
- Okay, I'll get you an escort.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.892
- No, no, no, I'm good.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.560
- No, you should
really take an escort

23:47.594 --> 23:49.061
to get him across the border.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.730
- I don't wanna draw any more
attention than I have to.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.764
- Okay then.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.137
- Hey, chica.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.473
Any chance they could
send us another girl

25:07.506 --> 25:11.644
to work on my legs while you-

25:11.678 --> 25:14.313
I may not get one of
these for a while, huh?

25:21.688 --> 25:24.691
Maybe afterwards, we can
have ourselves a little

25:25.692 --> 25:28.527
Turkish/Mexican ménage à trois?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.699
What say you, darling?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.537
Go low, yeah.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.844
It's time to go, Polat.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.878
- No! What?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.014
Come on!

25:48.047 --> 25:49.048
- We gotta go.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.049
- Why?!

25:51.718 --> 25:53.019
She hasn't even
done my legs yet.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.186
- I don't care.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.860
- Where is my lawyer?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.695
- He's gonna meet
you on US soil, okay?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.363
But we gotta leave
this hotel now, so.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.698
- I'm supposed to have
two more days here, man.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.867
- The party is over, dickhead.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.035
Pack up your shit!

26:09.068 --> 26:10.536
- Okay, okay!

26:10.569 --> 26:12.071
Every party has a pooper.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.547
Why you in a shit mood
all the time, huh?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.883
Life is good, man.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.251
You get ulcers.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.219
How 'bout you and I make a deal?

26:27.253 --> 26:29.221
How 'bout you drive me
to the airport instead,

26:29.255 --> 26:31.758
and I give you the password
for my laptop, okay?

26:31.791 --> 26:32.759
I give you the password,

26:32.792 --> 26:34.060
and I will give you the location

26:34.093 --> 26:36.929
of the man who shot your friend.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.230
Come on!

26:38.264 --> 26:39.565
You will have all of
Bin Farri's assets.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.400
You will get his
friends in the scene.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.769
You will get Bin Farri.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.739
Tell them I had a gun on you.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.774
We can make it work!

26:49.608 --> 26:50.743
Come on, man.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.579
I will deposit $5
million for you

26:53.612 --> 26:55.081
in any account in the world.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.916
100% untraceable.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.785
I can do it from
your cell phone.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.121
Give half the money to
the widow, if you want.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.422
I don't care.

27:05.958 --> 27:06.959
I'll make it 10 million,

27:06.993 --> 27:09.428
but we have to act now!

27:09.461 --> 27:10.596
Come on, man.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.932
- Let's go.

27:12.965 --> 27:13.933
Let's go.
- Come on, man!

27:13.966 --> 27:15.434
Fuckin' hell, man.

27:18.805 --> 27:19.772
Hey, señor, watch it!

27:19.806 --> 27:20.773
Be careful!

27:20.807 --> 27:22.441
That's a $3,000 case, man!

27:22.474 --> 27:23.943
Not a fucking laundry basket!
- Get in the fucking car!

27:30.316 --> 27:31.450
- Fuck!

27:51.670 --> 27:53.806
No!

27:53.840 --> 27:55.141
Not a fucking fence!

28:34.881 --> 28:35.714
- Vanowen.

28:37.383 --> 28:41.520
So his cell phone data shows
that he was at Vista Parallax,

28:41.553 --> 28:43.856
which is a higher-end
looking place.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.358
He was there at least
six times this month.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.861
So we set up a stakeout
across the street.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.898
And since your witness
literally lost his mind,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.901
I thought you might
want to stay occupied

28:54.934 --> 28:56.869
and fill in a hole
in the rotation.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.704
We have eyes on the place.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.406
- Okay, I'll give 'em a call.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.374
- I already did and
you got approved.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.210
Just as a reinforcement.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.379
This is not a DEA
operation, okay?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.747
Just watch the place.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.582
And it wasn't your
fault, Vanowen.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.554
Live and learn.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.890
Next time, you take
an escort with you.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.129
- I'll be right back.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.463
I'm gonna get some audio.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.189
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.528
Just one.
- Of course.

31:02.561 --> 31:03.395
This way, please.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.669
- How do
I get over here?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.171
- That's
the VIP section.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.540
- Ahh, how do I become a VIP?

31:15.908 --> 31:18.344
- VIPs don't need to
tell anyone they're VIPs.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.846
- Okay.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.181
- I'll be
back to take your order.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.778
- Sorry?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.251
Shit!

32:35.121 --> 32:36.122
Do I know you?

32:36.155 --> 32:37.923
- No, you don't.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.092
- Ah, I'm pretty sure
I've seen you before.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.427
- I'm sure you have.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.929
- No, the Parallax, right?

32:43.962 --> 32:44.796
- How do you know?

32:44.830 --> 32:46.598
- I've been there a few times.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.599
Seen you around.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.634
- I'm usually in the kitchen.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.801
- Oh, Anthony.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.471
- I still don't remember you.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.973
- Can we talk?

32:55.007 --> 32:57.309
- Listen, I'm not used to
speed dating at the market.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.611
- No, no, I'm not
trying to hit on you.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.946
I was just hoping we
could talk in private,

33:00.979 --> 33:03.782
so I don't get into trouble.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.650
Por favor?

33:05.684 --> 33:06.485
Come on.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.790
- I have nothing
to do with the business

33:11.823 --> 33:14.160
or anything that goes on there.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.961
I just make food.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.963
- No, I know.

33:17.996 --> 33:18.830
I know.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.966
- So what do you want from me?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.135
- What's your name?
- Mina.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.836
- Mina, Mina, that's nice.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.640
I got a big favor
to ask from you.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.142
- From me?

33:30.176 --> 33:32.844
- Yeah, I need you to place this

33:32.878 --> 33:35.647
underneath the VIP
table at the Parallax.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.516
- No!

33:38.517 --> 33:39.818
Why?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.553
- It's for an investigation
the DEA's running.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.490
- Are they selling
drugs in there?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.158
Fuck!
- Maybe.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.527
- Are you gonna be
shutting down the Parallax?

33:48.560 --> 33:49.695
- Why?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.497
- So I can start
looking for another job.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.998
- No, no, no, I...

33:53.031 --> 33:53.832
Gosh.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.833
I don't know, okay?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.368
But I doubt the people involved

33:56.402 --> 33:58.170
have anything to do with
the actual business, okay?

33:58.204 --> 34:00.672
But there's only
one way to find out.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.375
I mean, no one would
ever know it was you.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.511
- There's lots of cameras.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.845
- Just stick it under the table.

34:06.878 --> 34:07.713
That's all.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.551
- What's in it for me?

34:14.086 --> 34:15.687
- Come on!

34:15.721 --> 34:17.189
This'll take you
like 10 seconds.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.890
- I don't know, that
expression on your face

34:18.924 --> 34:21.193
tells me this is
a buyer's market.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.695
- Am I the buyer or the seller?

34:23.729 --> 34:25.531
- You are the seller.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.698
- Okay.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.733
- How about this?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.370
I do this thing for you,

34:31.403 --> 34:33.372
and then we get married,

34:33.405 --> 34:34.540
so I can get a green card,

34:34.573 --> 34:36.242
so I can join the CIA.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.045
- You wanna join the CIA?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.881
- The Culinary
Institute of America.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.250
It's in New York.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.885
Best cooking school in the US.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.720
- Wow! Okay.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.422
Let me think about that.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.058
Did not plan on getting
married anytime soon.

34:53.091 --> 34:53.925
- I'm just kidding.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.562
You're not even my type.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.230
- Ouch!

34:58.264 --> 34:59.765
- Gotta go to work now.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.078
I'll do it,

35:13.111 --> 35:14.480
but you will owe me one.

35:17.783 --> 35:18.584
- Of course.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.252
Don't tell anyone.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.454
- If I get fired, it's
gonna be your fault.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.090
- Fair enough.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.093
- You know, when you
were talking to me
back at the market,

35:28.126 --> 35:29.795
before I knew you
were a law man,

35:30.962 --> 35:32.664
I actually thought
it was my lucky day.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.173
- All
right, here she goes.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.528
Hell yeah!

36:47.239 --> 36:48.507
Yeah.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.736
Hey, let me get that.

37:55.941 --> 37:56.908
- How are
you doing, my friend?

37:56.942 --> 37:58.076
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.078
Welcome to Tijuana.
- Thank you.

38:14.793 --> 38:15.927
- Do
you enjoy hookahs?

38:15.961 --> 38:18.597
- Thank you, but
I prefer to work first.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.765
- Everything okay?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.601
- That's why you're here.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.102
- So
tell me, Fernando,

38:24.135 --> 38:25.771
how come you cost
me so much money

38:25.804 --> 38:27.473
after I pay for everything else?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.108
Let me see it.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.109
Where is it?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.611
- Do you have payment?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.446
- Half
as agreed now,

38:34.480 --> 38:37.315
the rest after it's installed.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.629
So want a hit?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.130
- The machine's hardwired

38:52.163 --> 38:54.800
to a local cellular network.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.667
- No, no!

38:56.668 --> 38:59.805
Where the fuck are they goin'?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.535
- Watch out there.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.921
- What the hell is that, guys?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.525
Come on!

40:07.906 --> 40:08.740
All right.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.381
I can't believe it.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.248
- It's all here.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.722
Easier than take-out.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.591
Please, try it yourself.

40:34.099 --> 40:34.900
- Motherfucker!

40:34.933 --> 40:36.234
Come on!

40:40.606 --> 40:42.073
- It's just
like changing a TV channel.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.918
- But next time,

40:52.951 --> 40:54.786
it could be the
entire power grid

40:54.820 --> 40:57.288
on the east side of
the United States.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.758
- So we're
done here then?

40:59.791 --> 41:01.259
Congratulations.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.093
Are we still on for tomorrow?

41:02.127 --> 41:03.128
- Of course.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.931
- Let's eat then.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.104
- Who's there?

41:22.013 --> 41:23.448
- Let him shoot!
- Yeah, follow me!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.283
Let's go!

41:40.165 --> 41:45.170
- What the fuck?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.311
- DEA, freeze!

42:13.364 --> 42:15.200
DEA, drop the weapon!

42:16.868 --> 42:17.836
Drop it.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.341
Fuck!

44:01.472 --> 44:02.273
- What happened?

44:02.307 --> 44:03.775
- Yeah, you shouldn't be here.

44:03.809 --> 44:05.310
- What did you do?

44:05.343 --> 44:06.778
- Me?! Nothin'.

44:06.812 --> 44:08.947
- Is this because of the-
- No, no, no, no.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.281
Definitely not.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.625
- Was
he actually here?

44:20.658 --> 44:21.827
- Yeah, yeah.

44:21.860 --> 44:22.794
No, someone knew
he'd be here, so.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.629
- Right under our fucking noses?

44:24.662 --> 44:25.496
- Yep.

44:27.999 --> 44:28.867
- Well...

44:30.335 --> 44:32.337
So that's Zico, for sure.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.638
- Yeah.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.707
- And the other guy
there was Bin Farri.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.644
These guys are like bodyguards,

44:39.677 --> 44:42.513
and who the fuck is the cowboy?

44:42.547 --> 44:44.482
The other ones, I don't
know who they are.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.819
- Yeah, we lost
power a few times.

44:47.853 --> 44:51.656
- Yeah, the whole city
went dark twice last night

44:51.689 --> 44:53.158
without no reason.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.359
- Wait, wait, the entire city?

44:54.392 --> 44:55.693
- The entire city.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.831
- All right, you know what?

45:01.900 --> 45:03.168
The camera had a battery.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.036
I bet it recorded everything.

45:22.553 --> 45:23.721
- Fuck off!

45:24.589 --> 45:25.423
- It was them.

45:27.392 --> 45:28.393
- Holy shit!

45:30.228 --> 45:31.562
Oh, this can't be good.

45:31.596 --> 45:34.866
- No, I mean, if you
think that's bad, I bet...

45:34.900 --> 45:37.202
Shit, man, I bet that
was just a rehearsal.

45:37.235 --> 45:38.069
- Fuck!

45:40.405 --> 45:41.239
- Yeah.

45:58.423 --> 46:00.558
- Okay, here it is.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.559
Where do you want it?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.098
- I have something to show you.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.435
I will transfer the
money right away.

46:10.468 --> 46:12.904
- I need the money
you already owed me.

46:12.938 --> 46:13.905
- What money?

46:13.939 --> 46:15.740
- Your guys showed me the money,

46:15.773 --> 46:17.742
then I demonstrated
the system to you.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.277
Suddenly, I was being shot at.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.613
- It seems that the
money is missing,

46:22.647 --> 46:24.449
but don't worry, we
will make it up to you.

46:24.482 --> 46:25.616
- Look, I just want my money,

46:25.650 --> 46:26.952
and I'm out of here, okay?

46:27.953 --> 46:28.954
- Please follow me.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.627
Khalil was going to
do the work here.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.429
Now, you must do it.

46:38.463 --> 46:39.264
- Me? No.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.098
No fucking way!

46:40.131 --> 46:41.099
I made what you wanted,

46:41.132 --> 46:42.433
I am delivering what you wanted,

46:42.467 --> 46:43.935
and I showed you that it works.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.437
I did my job and I
need to be paid now.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.273
- What can I offer you
to change your mind?

46:48.306 --> 46:49.774
- I watched my cousin
get killed because of you.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.443
- I'll give you three
times what we agreed.

46:52.477 --> 46:53.311
- $30 million?

46:56.147 --> 46:57.615
- As long as you
give me your word

46:57.648 --> 46:59.985
that you will stay
until the job is done,

47:02.487 --> 47:03.955
I'll do it right now.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.165
- 50 million.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.968
- 50?

47:17.002 --> 47:18.803
- Before you fuck up
the global economy,

47:18.836 --> 47:20.371
I'd like to have some security.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.978
- How long will it take?

47:27.012 --> 47:28.146
- A day or two,

47:28.179 --> 47:29.981
plus whatever the code
takes to propagate

47:30.015 --> 47:31.349
all over the internet.

47:34.352 --> 47:35.486
- Okay.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.354
- Okay.

48:38.583 --> 48:39.550
- Stunning.

48:39.584 --> 48:40.718
Thank you so much for...

48:40.751 --> 48:41.552
You making it here

48:41.586 --> 48:43.921
is a completely-
- Hi.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.391
Anthony Vanowen.

48:46.424 --> 48:47.225
- Rashida Bin Farri.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.726
It's a pleasure to meet you.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.562
- Is there somewhere we
could speak in private?

48:51.596 --> 48:52.430
- About what?

48:53.431 --> 48:55.266
- Hussein Bin Farri.
- My uncle?

48:56.634 --> 48:58.303
Why don't you talk
to him yourself?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.573
- Actually, I'd
rather speak with you.

49:02.607 --> 49:03.741
- Excuse me.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.076
Are you police?

49:05.110 --> 49:05.943
- DEA.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.746
- DEA.

49:08.779 --> 49:09.914
Do you think my uncle,

49:09.947 --> 49:12.250
who's funded most
of this institution,

49:12.283 --> 49:14.252
is somehow involved
in illegal narcotics?

49:14.285 --> 49:16.087
- No, it's not about that.

49:16.121 --> 49:17.588
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.257
- Hope you're enjoying yourself?

49:19.290 --> 49:20.958
- Absolutely.
- Hmmm.

49:22.493 --> 49:23.961
- Mina, my darling,
would you make sure

49:23.995 --> 49:26.431
everyone has champagne
by the end of my speech?

49:26.464 --> 49:27.265
- Of course.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.800
Excuse me.

49:29.834 --> 49:31.136
- Excuse
me, I have to go.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.303
- Is there any way...

49:32.337 --> 49:33.604
It's very important
that we speak.

49:33.638 --> 49:34.939
- I have to go.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.141
Call my office.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.344
- Sure.

50:47.712 --> 50:49.380
- That's the same guy
who tried to stop us

50:49.414 --> 50:51.182
outside the Parallax.

50:51.216 --> 50:53.518
- Our
guests of honor for the night.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.519
- The shooter?

50:54.552 --> 50:56.020
- Has to have been.
- No.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.388
I've seen him before.

50:58.223 --> 51:00.024
He's DEA.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.892
He was outside the
San Mar warehouse.

51:05.230 --> 51:08.399
- Did you know the DEA
had a history with San Mar

51:08.433 --> 51:09.434
before we bought it?

51:10.568 --> 51:11.702
- No.

51:13.404 --> 51:14.539
- So you didn't know

51:14.572 --> 51:16.574
that the San Mar
brothers smuggled drugs?

51:18.075 --> 51:19.210
- No.

51:19.244 --> 51:20.578
- Then why is the
DEA up my ass?!

51:24.415 --> 51:26.584
Go do something about it.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.221
Make sure it's him.

51:34.425 --> 51:35.726
- That's the guy!

51:35.760 --> 51:39.264
I know it's him.

52:31.982 --> 52:32.817
- Shit!

52:37.655 --> 52:38.489
- Gracias.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.994
Are you gonna follow me again?

52:45.162 --> 52:46.331
- What are you doin' out here?

52:46.364 --> 52:47.665
- I'm done for the night.

52:49.334 --> 52:50.635
- You happen to see a old guy

52:50.668 --> 52:53.804
come out here,
like, seconds ago?

52:53.838 --> 52:55.206
- You mean the guy in the Jeep?

52:56.341 --> 52:57.675
- Old guy?

52:57.708 --> 52:58.809
- That's him right now.

52:58.843 --> 52:59.844
He just left.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.484
- Shit!

53:06.517 --> 53:07.818
Is this you?
- Mm-hmm.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.320
- Go ahead, get in.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.156
We're gonna follow him.

53:18.363 --> 53:19.830
- Did you catch him smoking weed

53:19.864 --> 53:21.198
in the bathroom or something?

53:21.232 --> 53:22.199
- What? No, no!

53:23.368 --> 53:24.702
- Why are
we following him?

53:30.375 --> 53:31.509
- Come on!

53:31.542 --> 53:32.510
Look, look,
You're gonna lose him.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.178
- You wanted me to follow him,

53:34.211 --> 53:35.713
I'm following him.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.383
- You should
turn the lights off.

53:38.416 --> 53:40.184
- You're getting a
little too pushy, okay?

53:40.217 --> 53:41.386
I don't like that.

53:42.887 --> 53:43.688
- Look, I'm sorry.

53:43.721 --> 53:44.522
I just...

53:44.555 --> 53:46.190
I cannot lose him.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.358
- Happy?

53:47.392 --> 53:48.426
I can't see anything.

53:49.727 --> 53:50.861
- Your
eyes will adjust.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.229
- By the
time my eyes adjust

53:52.263 --> 53:54.064
we're gonna be
wrapped around a pole.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.033
- Wow.

54:00.771 --> 54:01.906
- So now what?

54:02.940 --> 54:06.110
What did he do?

54:07.578 --> 54:08.713
- Okay.

54:08.746 --> 54:11.215
I mean, I guess I could
tell you.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.551
I think that guy-
- No, no, no, no, no.

54:13.584 --> 54:14.752
Wait, wait, wait, no.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.721
I don't wanna know.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.390
I just changed my mind,
just like right now.

54:19.424 --> 54:20.591
Don't tell me anything.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.226
Don't you tell me anything,

54:22.259 --> 54:23.728
because I don't wanna have
to testify about anything.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.229
Nevermind.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.765
- I'm sorry if
any of this scared you, or...

54:30.601 --> 54:31.436
- Scared me?

54:33.270 --> 54:34.472
What is wrong with you?

54:36.106 --> 54:37.274
- Nothing.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.909
It's just the way you're
lookin' at me right now

54:38.943 --> 54:41.612
is making me think, I
don't know, maybe...

54:48.285 --> 54:49.920
- So what's next?

54:49.954 --> 54:51.422
I'll help.

54:51.456 --> 54:54.425
Even if it's just another
little job like the microphone,

54:54.459 --> 54:55.593
that was fun.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.294
- Another job?

54:57.328 --> 54:58.596
- Another bug?

54:58.629 --> 54:59.664
Secret camera?

55:00.798 --> 55:01.932
In "Breaking Bad",

55:01.966 --> 55:04.469
he puts that GPS
thingie by the tire.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.103
I can do that.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.605
Do you want me to put
one of those thingies

55:07.638 --> 55:09.106
on the Jeep's tire?

55:09.139 --> 55:12.943
- No, no, I don't want you
to put any thingie anywhere.

55:12.977 --> 55:15.613
- I just fucking tailed someone!

55:15.646 --> 55:17.615
This is so cool!

55:17.648 --> 55:20.117
So technically
speaking, what am I,

55:20.150 --> 55:23.988
a DEA, a CI, an informant?

55:25.022 --> 55:26.323
- Listen, Mina.

55:28.192 --> 55:29.960
You did me a huge favor,

55:29.994 --> 55:33.330
and then you did me another
favor, and I appreciate that,

55:33.364 --> 55:34.799
and I owe you one,

55:34.832 --> 55:37.134
but there are no more jobs.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.669
- Fine!

55:40.838 --> 55:42.006
So, now what?

55:43.007 --> 55:43.841
Take you back?

55:47.678 --> 55:48.679
- How 'bout a drink?

55:51.181 --> 55:52.817
- I know the perfect place.

56:10.034 --> 56:11.669
- What's that?

56:11.702 --> 56:13.337
- Do you care?

56:13.370 --> 56:15.172
- No, I don't care.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.380
- So what's your story?

56:24.549 --> 56:25.850
- My story?

56:25.883 --> 56:26.684
- Where did you grow up?

56:26.717 --> 56:27.752
- Fort Wayne, Indiana.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.721
Raised by my grandparents.

56:31.722 --> 56:32.557
- How come?

56:34.892 --> 56:37.394
- My mom died when I was a kid.

56:39.396 --> 56:42.733
My dad, he took me
to live with them.

56:43.601 --> 56:45.202
- Sorry.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.071
- It was a long time ago.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.940
- So your dad just
left you there?

56:51.576 --> 56:52.409
- Yeah.

56:53.578 --> 56:55.880
- You don't
abandon your kid.

56:55.913 --> 56:57.081
You just don't.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.921
- When did you learn
to speak English?

57:05.089 --> 57:06.557
- This is Tijuana.

57:06.591 --> 57:07.758
Learn or starve.

57:09.093 --> 57:11.395
Your Spanish is not bad.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.063
A little chunky.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.765
- Chunky.
- But cute.

57:18.135 --> 57:20.237
- Thought I wasn't your type?

57:20.270 --> 57:21.438
- You're not.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.094
- This is me.

57:44.128 --> 57:45.630
Thank you.

59:37.241 --> 59:40.544
Morning, sir.
- Mornin'.

59:40.577 --> 59:41.912
- Driver's license, please.

59:45.282 --> 59:48.753
- You're a little out of your
jurisdiction, aren't ya, son?

59:51.922 --> 59:53.557
Here you go.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.925
- Where you goin'?

59:54.959 --> 59:57.628
- Oh, over to the mercado,
get some groceries.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:03.934
Did I do something wrong?

1:00:05.135 --> 1:00:06.403
- I'm not a traffic cop.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:07.905
DEA.

1:00:07.938 --> 1:00:09.640
Special Agent Anthony Vanowen.

1:00:13.778 --> 1:00:14.945
Hi, Dad.

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:18.415
- Have a seat.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:19.483
Can I get you somethin'?

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.453
- Yeah, I'll take
a beer, if you have any?

1:00:23.487 --> 1:00:24.621
- Got that.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.629
There you go.

1:00:45.676 --> 1:00:46.476
- What?

1:00:49.313 --> 1:00:50.347
- I don't know, I'm...

1:00:52.850 --> 1:00:54.651
I'm just lookin'
at ya, and you...

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:57.121
You're a man.

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:57.988
You've grown up.

1:00:59.656 --> 1:01:00.825
You look so different.

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.462
Like, how
many years has it been?

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:06.330
Jesus!

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:12.837
I guess I owe you
an explanation.

1:01:14.338 --> 1:01:16.206
You think so, do you?

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:21.478
- You remember when you
and I drove from Cincinnati

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:23.147
up to Chicago to see the Cubs?

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:24.314
- The day my mom died?

1:01:24.348 --> 1:01:26.150
Yeah, I remember that.

1:01:26.183 --> 1:01:28.853
- And that man that
killed your mom

1:01:31.021 --> 1:01:32.689
was, in fact, trying to kill me.

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:36.360
- Wait.

1:01:36.393 --> 1:01:37.862
No.

1:01:37.895 --> 1:01:40.330
Wait, Why would
anyone wanna kill you?

1:01:40.364 --> 1:01:41.498
- The year before,

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:44.869
I filled his hotel room
with carbon monoxide,

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:50.174
and it killed his wife, his son,

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:52.242
his daughter, and his father.

1:01:54.544 --> 1:01:55.379
Everyone.

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:01.685
And he wasn't even there.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.687
He was supposed to be,
but he wasn't even there.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.189
- And you told me you were...

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:06.356
What was it?

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:07.892
An industrial lubricant
salesman, right?

1:02:07.925 --> 1:02:09.526
You traveled across the world

1:02:09.559 --> 1:02:11.561
all the time.
- No, my job

1:02:11.595 --> 1:02:15.199
was with a shadow
agency of the NSA,

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:18.568
and it was my job to
execute black warrants

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:20.704
and kill enemies of the state.

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:25.042
- You just kill people
for a living, that's all.

1:02:25.075 --> 1:02:26.376
- You know, when you
put it like that,

1:02:26.410 --> 1:02:28.879
it doesn't sound so
good, but it was my job.

1:02:28.913 --> 1:02:29.746
- It's not great.

1:02:32.116 --> 1:02:33.884
- I decided it was
time to let you go,

1:02:33.918 --> 1:02:36.720
and I knew one
day you'd move on.

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:39.890
You'd get married and
have kids of your own,

1:02:39.924 --> 1:02:42.392
and I would never
get to meet them,

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:45.595
and that was painful for me.

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:49.934
I
got a lot of regrets.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:55.973
The one regret that I never
allowed myself to have

1:02:57.441 --> 1:02:59.143
was the decision to protect you.

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:02.612
- Yeah, okay.

1:03:06.984 --> 1:03:07.818
- Tony?

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:12.957
I will be here if
you wanna talk.

1:03:15.292 --> 1:03:16.126
- Yeah, sure.

1:03:17.494 --> 1:03:18.328
Yeah.

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:39.649
- Tony?

1:03:40.985 --> 1:03:41.986
Tony, Tony?

1:03:44.488 --> 1:03:45.322
Take this.

1:03:46.490 --> 1:03:48.292
If you need to
talk, just call me.

1:03:48.325 --> 1:03:49.693
Dial direct, one.

1:03:51.495 --> 1:03:53.463
- Yeah, I'll call you.

1:03:53.497 --> 1:03:54.331
- Please.

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:00.137
Hey!

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:05.976
No!

1:05:03.267 --> 1:05:06.403
- How much longer?

1:05:06.436 --> 1:05:08.205
- I'd say about 24 hours.

1:05:13.944 --> 1:05:18.048
- Okay.

1:05:36.133 --> 1:05:38.102
Must be cheating on someone.

1:05:38.135 --> 1:05:40.237
Two phones.

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:41.105
I know.

1:05:42.106 --> 1:05:45.275
Let me ask you, Agent Vanowen,

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:47.111
have we met before?

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:50.580
Then what is it?

1:05:50.614 --> 1:05:53.583
What is it that I
did to piss you off?

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:54.951
Why are you in my life?

1:05:56.987 --> 1:05:59.289
- How the fuck should I
know who you are, huh?

1:06:00.957 --> 1:06:03.960
- You were at my
warehouse messing around.

1:06:03.994 --> 1:06:06.263
Then the other night, you
tried to stop my vehicle

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:08.165
after somebody tried
to assassinate me!

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:11.135
What am I to think?!

1:06:11.168 --> 1:06:12.602
- I don't know.

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:13.937
Why don't you ask your
trigger-happy friend here?

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:16.440
He's the one that
killed my partner.

1:06:16.473 --> 1:06:17.307
Yeah, I see you.

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.949
- What happened to Polat?

1:06:25.982 --> 1:06:27.451
- What happened?!

1:06:27.484 --> 1:06:29.786
He put a bullet in his head!

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.455
- That's not true.

1:06:31.488 --> 1:06:32.622
- I was there.

1:06:32.656 --> 1:06:34.491
- What did Polat tell you?

1:06:37.694 --> 1:06:39.963
- What is it that you want, huh?

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:44.301
- Uh-oh.

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:46.836
Yeah, I learned that from-

1:06:49.873 --> 1:06:53.310
Wait, does that
not mean pepperoni pizza?

1:06:55.679 --> 1:06:56.646
Know what?

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.182
Now, I just wanna kill you.

1:07:11.027 --> 1:07:12.162
Hey, what?!

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:21.838
- What is going on?

1:07:32.082 --> 1:07:33.550
- Fuck you!

1:07:36.586 --> 1:07:39.723
- They could be tracking him.

1:07:47.564 --> 1:07:48.398
Hello?

1:07:52.402 --> 1:07:53.270
It's for you.

1:07:55.739 --> 1:07:56.773
- Bin Farri?

1:07:57.907 --> 1:07:59.543
- Who is this?

1:07:59.576 --> 1:08:02.212
- Someone who
knows you very well.

1:08:02.246 --> 1:08:05.415
It's been over 20
years since Miami.

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:07.751
- It's you.

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:10.086
It all makes sense now.

1:08:13.423 --> 1:08:17.093
You used this DEA agent
as bait to find me.

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:18.928
Clever.

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:22.399
- Why weren't you in Miami?

1:08:22.432 --> 1:08:24.401
Your family was there, but no,

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:26.736
you were in some hotel
with your mistress.

1:08:26.770 --> 1:08:28.738
- We all have regrets.

1:08:28.772 --> 1:08:31.275
- How did you find
out about my son?

1:08:32.276 --> 1:08:33.076
- Son?

1:08:33.109 --> 1:08:34.244
- Anthony!

1:08:34.278 --> 1:08:35.412
Who else?

1:08:35.445 --> 1:08:37.447
- Anthony Vanowen is your son?

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:39.916
- Let him go.

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:41.918
- That's not going to happen.

1:08:51.461 --> 1:08:52.429
- What, big man?

1:08:52.462 --> 1:08:54.097
- You can't kill a DEA agent.

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:55.465
- Everyone can be killed.

1:08:56.466 --> 1:08:57.301
- Bring it.

1:08:58.635 --> 1:09:01.271
Bring what?

1:09:23.693 --> 1:09:25.795
- That door was
supposed to be locked!

1:09:25.829 --> 1:09:26.796
- He's the fuckin' janitor.

1:09:26.830 --> 1:09:27.664
He has keys to everything.

1:09:27.697 --> 1:09:29.132
It was locked.

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:32.302
- What's this?

1:09:32.336 --> 1:09:33.670
- I'll check
the main power.

1:09:35.004 --> 1:09:35.972
- Was that you, Fernando?

1:09:36.005 --> 1:09:37.841
- Of course not.

1:09:59.896 --> 1:10:00.830
- Qué pasa?

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.343
- Took
you long enough.

1:10:13.377 --> 1:10:15.211
- Well, I'm here now.

1:10:19.716 --> 1:10:21.851
Time to go home, Son.

1:10:29.726 --> 1:10:30.560
- Come on!

1:10:35.899 --> 1:10:38.368
- Vámonos!

1:11:06.430 --> 1:11:07.897
- Captain?

1:12:02.185 --> 1:12:03.453
- Is this their Wi-Fi?

1:12:24.173 --> 1:12:25.842
- That was pretty amazing.

1:12:26.876 --> 1:12:28.144
- Nah.

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:30.013
- That was you at
the Parallax, huh?

1:12:31.548 --> 1:12:32.682
- Uh-huh.

1:12:32.716 --> 1:12:34.217
- Pretty sure you
almost killed me there.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:39.322
- You know, I was
just thinkin' about that.

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:40.824
- Yeah.

1:12:40.857 --> 1:12:42.526
- And it's a good
thing you told me

1:12:42.559 --> 1:12:46.362
you were with the DEA,
or otherwise, who knows?

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:50.567
- Jesus!

1:13:09.385 --> 1:13:12.355
Oh, shit.

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:15.525
Fuck.

1:13:20.564 --> 1:13:23.199
- You sleep down below.

1:13:23.232 --> 1:13:24.400
I'll take up top.

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:26.870
Take a shower.

1:13:26.903 --> 1:13:28.872
It'll probably make
you feel better.

1:13:28.905 --> 1:13:31.541
- Yeah.

1:13:31.575 --> 1:13:32.576
- Thanks, yeah.

1:13:35.579 --> 1:13:37.581
- You said you were
at my high school.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.386
Graduation?

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:45.088
- Yes, I was.

1:13:45.121 --> 1:13:48.091
- Was that just another
one of your lies, or what?

1:13:49.759 --> 1:13:51.928
- No, I was there.

1:13:53.463 --> 1:13:55.565
And you were with
your girlfriend.

1:13:55.599 --> 1:13:56.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:13:58.768 --> 1:14:01.437
And afterwards,

1:14:01.471 --> 1:14:04.574
the two of you went
out and had a pizza.

1:14:04.608 --> 1:14:07.243
You were still wearing
your graduation robes

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:10.747
and looked absolutely
adorable, if I say so.

1:14:16.953 --> 1:14:18.955
I was sittin' at the
table right next to you.

1:14:22.492 --> 1:14:25.128
Yeah, that was the
last time I saw ya.

1:14:27.296 --> 1:14:28.131
Hmm.

1:14:31.635 --> 1:14:34.638
- Is that-
- Mm-mmm.

1:14:34.671 --> 1:14:35.505
Yeah.

1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:39.776
Yeah.

1:14:39.809 --> 1:14:41.778
I...

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:44.848
After her burial, I moved
her out, outta there.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:47.116
- Why?

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:47.951
- I don't know.

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:49.118
I just...

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:51.320
I didn't feel right
leavin' her behind,

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:54.991
and I missed her.

1:14:55.024 --> 1:14:55.859
Yeah.

1:14:57.694 --> 1:15:00.296
She's been there
all these years.

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:02.198
- Excuse me.

1:15:05.835 --> 1:15:08.972
Oh, my god!

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:10.840
Mina, hi.

1:15:10.874 --> 1:15:12.308
I...

1:15:12.341 --> 1:15:14.978
I really, I meant
to call, I just...

1:15:15.011 --> 1:15:16.179
I was kinda tied up.

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:19.182
- Tony?

1:15:20.550 --> 1:15:21.685
- Hola, gringo.

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:48.678
- What?

1:15:48.712 --> 1:15:50.513
Hey!
- I'm gonna kill that fucker!

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:51.681
- Tony, Tony!

1:15:51.715 --> 1:15:52.849
Hey!
- No!

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:54.050
- Let the cops
take care of this one.

1:15:54.083 --> 1:15:55.184
- No, I'm
gonna kill that fucker.

1:15:55.218 --> 1:15:56.019
- And then what?

1:15:56.052 --> 1:15:57.020
- And then Bin Farri!

1:15:57.053 --> 1:15:57.854
- Oh, and then what?

1:15:57.887 --> 1:15:59.355
You're a DEA agent.

1:15:59.388 --> 1:16:01.524
- All right, fine, fuck it.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:03.026
- No, no!

1:16:03.059 --> 1:16:04.360
Listen to me.
- What?

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:06.429
- You cross that line,
you end up like me.

1:16:09.733 --> 1:16:11.735
I know what I'm talkin' about.

1:16:47.603 --> 1:16:49.305
- Put the gun down
or I shoot her.

1:16:50.774 --> 1:16:52.575
Put the fucking gun down.

1:16:57.947 --> 1:16:58.782
- All right.

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:04.253
- And the other one.

1:17:12.128 --> 1:17:13.096
- What now?

1:17:13.129 --> 1:17:13.963
- Sit down.

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:17.633
Call him.

1:17:18.501 --> 1:17:19.769
- Your boss?

1:17:19.803 --> 1:17:21.270
- The old guy that got you out.

1:17:21.304 --> 1:17:22.138
- Why?

1:17:23.807 --> 1:17:27.443
- Call him or she's dead.
- Fuck you!

1:17:27.476 --> 1:17:30.446
You and I both know you're
not gonna shoot her.

1:17:30.479 --> 1:17:31.948
- I won't?

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:32.816
- No.

1:17:32.849 --> 1:17:34.984
This neighborhood at this time?

1:17:35.018 --> 1:17:37.286
Cops'll be swarmin'
this place in minutes.

1:17:38.822 --> 1:17:41.290
- Okay.

1:17:42.658 --> 1:17:44.660
Call him or I throw her off!

1:17:44.694 --> 1:17:46.162
- Fine.

1:17:48.164 --> 1:17:48.998
Now, let her go.

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:57.841
Hey, Dad, it's me.

1:18:36.379 --> 1:18:37.213
It's okay.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:39.849
- Where do I find him?

1:18:39.883 --> 1:18:41.550
- Like I'm gonna
fuckin' tell you!

1:18:43.052 --> 1:18:44.353
- Ow, fuck!

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:47.523
You could've just
asked me again!

1:18:47.556 --> 1:18:49.525
- I'm old and I don't
have that kinda time!

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:51.060
- I don't fucking know!

1:18:51.094 --> 1:18:52.862
All he told me was to get you!

1:18:52.896 --> 1:18:54.397
- And how were you
supposed to contact him?

1:18:54.430 --> 1:18:55.865
- Fucking text!

1:18:55.899 --> 1:18:57.366
- And what were you
supposed to say in the text?

1:18:57.400 --> 1:18:58.567
- That I'm on my way.

1:18:58.601 --> 1:19:00.870
- Text him!
- All right, all right!

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:08.544
- Give me the phone.

1:19:08.577 --> 1:19:10.713
Give me the phone!

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:11.915
- Fuck!

1:19:13.416 --> 1:19:17.420
- "Kill the agent, make Nick
watch, then bring him here."

1:19:17.453 --> 1:19:19.722
"I'll give you the
million dollars."

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.424
Look, he shared
his location, too.

1:19:23.092 --> 1:19:24.560
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars.

1:19:24.593 --> 1:19:27.396
- Bin Farri has a
fucking hard-on for you.

1:19:27.430 --> 1:19:28.397
I don't know what you did,

1:19:28.431 --> 1:19:29.732
but he wants you fuckin' dead.

1:19:29.765 --> 1:19:31.734
- A million dollars.

1:19:31.767 --> 1:19:33.736
I guess you didn't wanna
share that with anyone,

1:19:33.769 --> 1:19:35.571
so that's why you're here alone?

1:19:35.604 --> 1:19:38.741
That's pretty
industrious of you, Zico.

1:19:38.774 --> 1:19:40.743
- Who fucking cares, all right?

1:19:40.776 --> 1:19:42.611
I'm fucked!
- Maybe.

1:19:44.447 --> 1:19:45.581
Maybe not.

1:19:45.614 --> 1:19:47.951
Maybe you can help
get Bin Farri to me,

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:50.786
and you keep the million.

1:19:50.820 --> 1:19:52.288
- The fuck I will.

1:19:53.289 --> 1:19:54.790
Yeah fuckin' right.

1:19:54.824 --> 1:19:56.092
- And then we just part ways,

1:19:56.125 --> 1:19:57.260
and never see each other again.

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:58.461
Gentleman's agreement.

1:19:59.295 --> 1:20:00.596
- No!

1:20:00.629 --> 1:20:02.131
Fuck that!

1:20:02.165 --> 1:20:04.934
I will kill him before
I let him walk away with

1:20:04.968 --> 1:20:06.435
a million fuckin' dollars!
- Tony?

1:20:06.469 --> 1:20:07.470
- Are you kiddin' me?

1:20:07.503 --> 1:20:09.138
- Bin Farri's the target.

1:20:10.306 --> 1:20:12.475
- You know you killed
my best friend, right?

1:20:12.508 --> 1:20:13.943
For no fuckin' reason!

1:20:13.977 --> 1:20:15.611
- I don't wanna
kill nobody, man!

1:20:15.644 --> 1:20:18.114
I just don't wanna
go to El Hongo, man!

1:20:18.147 --> 1:20:20.616
I don't
wanna go back there.

1:20:20.649 --> 1:20:22.485
Just fucking kill me now!

1:20:22.518 --> 1:20:24.453
- I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1:20:24.487 --> 1:20:27.323
Now that kid's gotta grow
up without a fucking dad

1:20:27.356 --> 1:20:29.792
all because of a piece
of shit like you!

1:20:29.825 --> 1:20:30.793
- Then fucking kill me!

1:20:30.826 --> 1:20:33.129
- Gladly!
- No, no, no, Tony!

1:20:33.162 --> 1:20:34.630
No, no, no!

1:20:34.663 --> 1:20:35.798
We need him.

1:20:35.831 --> 1:20:36.665
We got a deal.

1:20:41.704 --> 1:20:44.140
Come on, you sorry sack of shit.

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:46.642
- Fuck that!
- Get up!

1:20:46.675 --> 1:20:48.144
Get on your feet!

1:20:58.854 --> 1:21:02.658
- There are 20 patrol
cars outside the building.

1:21:02.691 --> 1:21:04.660
There's a bomb squad.

1:21:04.693 --> 1:21:05.995
They're trying to
dismantle something

1:21:06.029 --> 1:21:07.163
that looks like a bomb.

1:21:07.196 --> 1:21:09.332
- It doesn't look like a bomb.

1:21:09.365 --> 1:21:10.166
- What is this?

1:21:10.199 --> 1:21:11.534
Why are you involved?

1:21:13.236 --> 1:21:14.837
Why am I involved?

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:17.840
- We will go to Dubai
tonight for the time being.

1:21:17.873 --> 1:21:19.842
You will learn more
as I need you to.

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:22.011
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:21:22.045 --> 1:21:23.679
- You will go where I tell you.

1:21:23.712 --> 1:21:25.348
- No!

1:21:25.381 --> 1:21:26.682
I live here.

1:21:26.715 --> 1:21:28.584
And you haven't
answered my question.

1:21:29.885 --> 1:21:31.520
Did you bring a
bomb to my building?

1:21:31.554 --> 1:21:33.022
- It's not a bomb.
- What is it then?!

1:21:33.056 --> 1:21:34.723
- I had a personal project!

1:21:34.757 --> 1:21:36.892
- Your personal project
was to build a bomb?

1:21:36.926 --> 1:21:38.727
We're not that family anymore.

1:21:38.761 --> 1:21:41.030
- I needed a place to
keep a quantum device.

1:21:41.064 --> 1:21:42.365
It's not a bomb.

1:21:42.398 --> 1:21:44.867
That's why we needed
to upgrade the power.

1:21:44.900 --> 1:21:46.535
- You used me?

1:21:46.569 --> 1:21:48.437
- You had no problems
taking my money.

1:21:52.575 --> 1:21:53.409
What?

1:21:54.743 --> 1:21:55.578
- You know what?

1:21:55.611 --> 1:21:56.712
Fuck this!

1:21:56.745 --> 1:21:58.047
I'm not going anywhere.

1:21:58.081 --> 1:21:59.215
- You agreed to do this.

1:21:59.248 --> 1:22:00.049
- Not this!

1:22:00.083 --> 1:22:01.250
I'm out!

1:22:01.284 --> 1:22:04.053
The device is being
dismantled as we speak.

1:22:04.087 --> 1:22:05.721
You haven't paid me!

1:22:05.754 --> 1:22:06.555
Manuel is dead.

1:22:06.589 --> 1:22:08.091
It's all over.

1:22:08.124 --> 1:22:10.059
Your people can't keep
a train on tracks.

1:22:10.093 --> 1:22:11.894
Talk about incompetent idiots.

1:22:11.927 --> 1:22:14.897
- Fernando, there's no one else.

1:22:14.930 --> 1:22:16.065
You're the only
one who can do it.

1:22:17.266 --> 1:22:19.102
- That was enough!

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:29.412
- What?

1:22:49.132 --> 1:22:50.933
- Open the door.

1:23:05.648 --> 1:23:07.283
- Get him in the back.

1:23:08.651 --> 1:23:09.618
- Copy.

1:23:09.652 --> 1:23:10.486
- He's here.

1:23:23.332 --> 1:23:24.833
Set him over there.

1:23:28.504 --> 1:23:30.173
- What the hell is going on?

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:38.681
What is this?

1:23:40.015 --> 1:23:41.650
What-

1:23:41.684 --> 1:23:44.320
- Fuck!

1:23:44.353 --> 1:23:45.188
Are we good?

1:23:46.355 --> 1:23:47.323
Okay.

1:23:47.356 --> 1:23:48.357
Can we do this now?

1:23:50.025 --> 1:23:51.494
It got a little bit weird.

1:23:51.527 --> 1:23:53.329
- Same account?
- No.

1:23:53.362 --> 1:23:55.164
Use this one.

1:23:55.198 --> 1:23:56.832
Fuck.

1:24:00.703 --> 1:24:02.004
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1:24:02.037 --> 1:24:02.871
- Okay.

1:24:06.041 --> 1:24:08.511
Wondering what's next?

1:24:08.544 --> 1:24:09.378
- Nah.

1:24:10.879 --> 1:24:13.216
Judgin' by that
character over there,

1:24:13.249 --> 1:24:14.517
I get the idea.

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:17.386
Looks like you boys
started the party early.

1:24:18.721 --> 1:24:20.356
- Let me see him.

1:24:33.736 --> 1:24:34.537
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Ooohh!

1:24:38.741 --> 1:24:39.742
- Do something!

1:24:39.775 --> 1:24:42.545
- I can't.

1:24:42.578 --> 1:24:43.912
I don't have any bullets.

1:24:43.946 --> 1:24:45.548
- Okay, okay, okay!

1:24:46.915 --> 1:24:47.750
- No!

1:24:49.252 --> 1:24:50.085
Madam?

1:24:52.255 --> 1:24:53.222
You need to get outta here.

1:24:53.256 --> 1:24:54.223
Go home!

1:24:54.257 --> 1:24:56.058
- I live here.

1:24:56.091 --> 1:24:57.260
- What?

1:24:57.293 --> 1:24:58.727
- Go to
the Cultural Center,

1:24:58.761 --> 1:25:00.563
ask for Captain Escalante,

1:25:00.596 --> 1:25:02.798
give him this address,
he'll know what to do.

1:25:03.766 --> 1:25:04.733
- Go!

1:25:13.108 --> 1:25:15.077
- Okay, okay.

1:25:15.110 --> 1:25:16.912
Now you tell me what you want.

1:25:16.945 --> 1:25:18.414
A million dollars?

1:25:18.447 --> 1:25:19.282
- No.

1:25:29.124 --> 1:25:30.926
- You fucking predator!

1:25:30.959 --> 1:25:32.795
Let's talk about this!

1:25:33.962 --> 1:25:35.764
- No.

1:25:43.306 --> 1:25:46.475
- Okay, gringo, how
do I get my money?

1:25:48.644 --> 1:25:49.645
- Get a job.

1:25:52.147 --> 1:25:52.981
- What?

1:26:27.683 --> 1:26:29.852
- Zico?

1:27:20.436 --> 1:27:21.870
- Whoa, there's a wave comin'!

1:27:21.904 --> 1:27:23.205
And then another wave!

1:27:23.238 --> 1:27:25.207
What are we gonna do, Captain?

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:26.542
What are we gonna do?

1:27:26.575 --> 1:27:28.377
Oh, my god, look at that fog!

1:27:28.411 --> 1:27:29.378
No, don't cry!

1:27:29.412 --> 1:27:30.546
No, don't.
- You want

1:27:30.579 --> 1:27:31.580
everything on it, right?

1:27:31.614 --> 1:27:32.715
- Yes, yes.

1:27:32.748 --> 1:27:34.249
Here, I'll take that.

1:27:34.283 --> 1:27:35.418
- Oh, my!

1:27:36.251 --> 1:27:37.920
- All right, you'll trade off.

1:27:37.953 --> 1:27:39.755
- Whoo!
- Do you have a drink?

1:27:39.788 --> 1:27:40.889
- Yeah, I think I do.

1:27:40.923 --> 1:27:41.890
Thank you.

1:27:41.924 --> 1:27:43.392
- Mina?

1:27:45.761 --> 1:27:47.229
I gotta tell you,

1:27:47.262 --> 1:27:49.765
this is probably the best
hamburger I've ever had.

1:27:49.798 --> 1:27:51.767
You can't get a decent
hamburger in Mexico.

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:53.802
You just gotta rely on the taco.

1:27:56.104 --> 1:27:57.072
- Thank you.

1:27:57.105 --> 1:27:58.407
I'm better now.
- Aww!

1:27:58.441 --> 1:27:59.575
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1:27:59.608 --> 1:28:01.243
- I love this junebug.

1:28:01.276 --> 1:28:02.611
Could hold him all day.

1:28:03.812 --> 1:28:04.913
- You guys eat first.

1:28:04.947 --> 1:28:06.248
I'm good right now.

1:28:06.281 --> 1:28:07.950
My stomach is still
turning from the boat ride.

1:28:07.983 --> 1:28:10.419
- Yeah, it was a little
choppy out there today.

1:28:10.453 --> 1:28:11.286
I'm sorry.

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:12.588
Ah, it was lovely.

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:14.757
I'm just not used to it.
- Yeah.

1:28:14.790 --> 1:28:15.924
Hey!

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:17.092
I wanted to ask,

1:28:17.125 --> 1:28:18.927
how are you settling
into the new apartment?

1:28:18.961 --> 1:28:19.795
It's good?

1:28:19.828 --> 1:28:21.464
- Everything is brand new.

1:28:21.497 --> 1:28:23.098
- Hmm.

1:28:23.131 --> 1:28:25.434
- We love our
little place, don't we?

1:28:25.468 --> 1:28:26.935
- Do you...

1:28:26.969 --> 1:28:28.103
Do you need anything else?

1:28:28.136 --> 1:28:29.104
- We're good.

1:28:29.137 --> 1:28:30.272
Thank you.

1:28:30.305 --> 1:28:31.774
You've done enough.

1:28:31.807 --> 1:28:35.110
I still can't get over that
whole life insurance thing.

1:28:35.143 --> 1:28:35.944
- Yeah, I know, that was...

1:28:35.978 --> 1:28:37.980
That was pretty odd.

1:28:38.013 --> 1:28:38.947
- What happened?

1:28:38.981 --> 1:28:40.449
- No.

1:28:40.483 --> 1:28:41.617
My husband never told me

1:28:41.650 --> 1:28:43.486
he had a million
dollar life insurance.

1:28:44.687 --> 1:28:47.289
I thought I'd end up in
the streets with a baby.

1:28:47.322 --> 1:28:48.991
Anthony remembered, thank god!

1:28:50.826 --> 1:28:52.795
And he made them pay.

1:28:52.828 --> 1:28:53.996
Can you imagine?

1:28:54.997 --> 1:28:56.965
- Oh, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy.

1:28:56.999 --> 1:28:58.467
Yeah, yes, da!

1:28:58.501 --> 1:28:59.802
Yessa!
- Hey!

1:29:01.036 --> 1:29:01.837
- Right?
- Thanks to his daddy

1:29:01.870 --> 1:29:03.472
and Uncle Tony,

1:29:03.506 --> 1:29:05.641
this big guy's gonna grow up
in such a nice neighborhood

1:29:05.674 --> 1:29:07.476
with lots of other kids.

1:29:07.510 --> 1:29:08.644
- Yep.

1:29:08.677 --> 1:29:09.845
And you're gonna
go to college, too.

1:29:09.878 --> 1:29:11.179
- Are you?

1:29:11.213 --> 1:29:13.315
Are you gonna go to college?

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:14.316
You better.

1:29:14.349 --> 1:29:16.018
- Maybe he'll go to Berkeley?

1:29:16.051 --> 1:29:17.319
- Berkeley?

1:29:17.352 --> 1:29:18.821
Oh, no, no, no,
not Berkeley, no.

1:29:18.854 --> 1:29:21.323
He's going to Notre Dame on
a full football scholarship.

1:29:21.356 --> 1:29:22.491
Mark my words.

1:29:22.525 --> 1:29:23.325
Yeah.

1:29:23.358 --> 1:29:24.660
- Vanowen.

1:29:24.693 --> 1:29:25.861
- Look out
over your starboard bow

1:29:25.894 --> 1:29:26.895
by the breaker wall.

1:29:29.865 --> 1:29:31.834
There you go.

1:29:31.867 --> 1:29:33.335
- Hey.

1:29:33.368 --> 1:29:35.538
- I see you guys are
having a party without me?

1:29:35.571 --> 1:29:37.840
Well, I'm not upset about that.

1:29:37.873 --> 1:29:39.207
This isn't a social call.

1:29:41.209 --> 1:29:42.678
- I figured it wasn't.

1:29:42.711 --> 1:29:44.379
- I need a tag-team to
carry out a black warrant

1:29:44.413 --> 1:29:45.748
in San Diego right away.

1:29:46.915 --> 1:29:48.183
- All right, cool.

1:29:48.216 --> 1:29:49.351
- Tell the
old man I'm not upset

1:29:49.384 --> 1:29:50.853
about not bein'
invited to the party.

1:29:50.886 --> 1:29:52.020
- Yeah, okay.

1:29:52.054 --> 1:29:52.888
Thanks.

1:29:59.928 --> 1:30:00.863
- Fuckin' Frankie!

1:30:00.896 --> 1:30:02.197
He's always wearin' that suit.

1:30:02.230 --> 1:30:03.365
What's that all about?

1:30:03.398 --> 1:30:04.199
- I don't know,

1:30:04.232 --> 1:30:06.068
but he's got a job in San Diego.

1:30:06.101 --> 1:30:07.369
Do you wanna join?

1:30:07.402 --> 1:30:11.740
Yeah, count me in.

1:30:15.744 --> 1:30:16.745
- All right.

1:30:17.746 --> 1:30:21.216
- Yeah.

1:30:29.758 --> 1:30:30.893
- Oh, lord.
