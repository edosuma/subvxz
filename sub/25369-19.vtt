so I had a choice.

I could accept those limitations
or I could overcome them.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.381

09:50.381 --> 09:54.219
I was also treated
as an outsider growing up,

09:54.219 --> 09:57.347
but I dealt with it...
differently.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.726

to just detach myself

blessed isolation.

are to impress sentient ooze?
[yells]

11:44.162 --> 11:46.164
[grunts]

11:46.164 --> 11:50.710
The day has finally come,
Spider.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.837
Venom will destroy you!

11:52.837 --> 11:56.591
Speaking in third person
to sound more intimidating?

11:56.591 --> 11:58.885
Ha! I invented that.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.264
[Venom grunting]

12:03.264 --> 12:04.474
Aah!

12:04.474 --> 12:05.725
[Anna Maria]
Good work, team.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.185
We cleaned up
in a single morning.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.104
This is proof that no one,
not even super‐villains,

12:10.104 --> 12:12.023
can derail us from‐‐ Huh?
[crash]

12:12.023 --> 12:14.651
[grunts, yells]

12:14.651 --> 12:17.111
[grunts]
Oh, come on!

12:17.111 --> 12:20.531
[yells]
[grunts]

12:20.531 --> 12:22.951
Get these students
out of here! Aah!

12:22.951 --> 12:25.828
You heard the web‐head. Go!
[gasps]

12:25.828 --> 12:27.664
[whimpering]

12:27.664 --> 12:29.916
No. Not again.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.834
We gotta go, Thompson!

12:31.834 --> 12:34.295
[sniffing]
[straining]

12:34.295 --> 12:36.005
Ahh.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.759
I'd know the smell
of that fear anywhere.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.762
Flash Thompson.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.723
You'll be next.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.062
[grunts]

12:58.486 --> 13:00.989
Ride the lightning, creep!

13:00.989 --> 13:03.825
[screams]

13:03.825 --> 13:07.453
There's more
where that came from,
you literal slimeball!

13:07.453 --> 13:09.455
Aah!
Aah!

13:09.455 --> 13:11.457
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

13:11.457 --> 13:13.001
Spidey, help!

13:13.001 --> 13:16.170
Anna Maria! Flash!
[grunts]

13:17.213 --> 13:18.381
[grunts]

13:18.381 --> 13:22.051
Let them go!
[grunting]

13:22.051 --> 13:25.930
[Venom]
Such emotion.
Friends of yours?

13:25.930 --> 13:29.267
Give yourself to me, Spider,

13:29.267 --> 13:33.438
or I will end these two!
[gasps]

13:33.438 --> 13:35.732
<i>These feelings...</i>

13:35.732 --> 13:39.027
<i>It is as if their lives</i>
<i>are more important than my own.</i>

13:39.027 --> 13:41.029
<i>But that would defy logic,</i>

13:41.029 --> 13:44.741
<i>for I, above all,</i>
<i>am superior.</i>

13:44.741 --> 13:49.495
Yes, make the right choice.
Come to me.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.497
Ugh!

13:51.497 --> 13:55.084
A trick!
You're not him! Liar!
Aah!

13:55.084 --> 13:57.503
Your friends will be destroyed!

14:00.089 --> 14:02.967
Bring me the real
Spider‐Man now!

14:02.967 --> 14:06.679
I am the real Spider‐Man!
[grunts]

14:06.679 --> 14:09.057
I bonded with the spider!
[yells]

14:09.057 --> 14:12.185
[straining]
If you will not
bring me the real spider,

14:12.185 --> 14:14.395
you are useless to me!

14:14.395 --> 14:18.024
He is right.
I am useless and a failure.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.819
Because of me, the only friends
I have ever known will perish.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.530
<i>It looks like somebody</i>
<i>needs a hug.</i>
<i>[grunts]</i>

14:24.530 --> 14:27.867
<i>Ock, I don't have</i>
<i>much time left,</i>
[straining]

14:27.867 --> 14:31.412
<i>but I'll give you</i>
<i>everything I've got.</i>
[screaming]

14:33.456 --> 14:35.374
[grunts]

14:35.374 --> 14:38.002
[both groaning]

14:38.002 --> 14:40.922
Another robot toy!

14:40.922 --> 14:41.964
Enough!

14:47.136 --> 14:50.723
<i>[static]</i>
<i>Ock! What are you doing?</i>
<i>Get back out there!</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:52.975
I'm not going back.
<i>What?</i>

14:52.975 --> 14:55.394
<i>You can't leave</i>
<i>those people to Venom.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:59.232
<i>You've lived my memories.</i>
<i>You know Uncle Ben</i>
<i>would never want that.</i>

14:59.232 --> 15:03.027
I know what Ben would want.
I'm not going back out there.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.154
You are.
[beeps]

15:10.868 --> 15:14.080
So, here we are,
in the moment of transfer.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.249
A microsecond of time.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.252
You made it
pretty clear yesterday
you would never do this.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.045
Why give me
my body back now?

15:21.045 --> 15:25.049
I‐‐ I failed, Parker.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.553
And because of that,
good people are about
to lose their lives.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.265
I thought more technology,
more reason, more logistics

15:32.265 --> 15:34.934
would make me a better hero
than you ever were.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.311
Maybe it has.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.065
No. Seeing you
show up just now,

15:41.065 --> 15:45.111
willing to use
the last few minutes
of your life to save mine,

15:45.111 --> 15:48.531
save the man who took
everything from you‐‐

15:48.531 --> 15:51.534
That is illogical,
preposterous,

15:51.534 --> 15:54.370
and completely heroic

15:54.370 --> 15:56.998
in a way I realize
I never could be.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.042
I have been a fool.

16:00.042 --> 16:05.173
You, Peter Parker,
were always
the Superior Spider‐Man.

16:05.173 --> 16:10.469
But, Ock,
the circuits in the arms‐‐
they're degrading quickly.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.848
You're swapping your mind
into a place that can't
keep it alive for long.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.975
I am well aware.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.227
But I have the power
to do this,

16:18.227 --> 16:21.397
so I have the responsibility
to do it too.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.734
I only ask that you save
Anna Maria and Flash.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.653
That will make
this decision worth it.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.952
[muffled grunting]
Show yourself,
or it's over for this one!

16:34.952 --> 16:36.120
[both grunt]

16:36.120 --> 16:38.164
[grunts]
Whoa!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.166
I forgot how bad
you smell up close.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.293
I bet when you chop onions,
you make <i>them</i> cry.

16:42.293 --> 16:45.004
Silence, fraud!

16:45.004 --> 16:47.048
[grunting]
"Fraud"? You mean
you don't recognize

16:47.048 --> 16:50.134
your friendly, neighborhood me?
[grunting]

16:50.134 --> 16:51.302

[growls]

16:55.056 --> 16:58.643
What‐‐ S‐Spider‐Man,
you saved me.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.853
Flash, get to safety.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.190
I'll get your friend
out of the clutches
of ol' Gooey McGoo‐Face here.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.026
Quips? Jokes?
[grunts]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.111
Perhaps...

17:09.111 --> 17:12.323
Ugh!
[grunting]

17:12.323 --> 17:14.825
That is a pretty gross
ID check you got.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.161
Maybe next time,
I can just show you my bus pass?

17:17.161 --> 17:22.041
It is you,
the real Spider‐Man,

17:22.041 --> 17:24.418
Peter Parker!
Hmm?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.589
[both grunting]

17:28.589 --> 17:30.925
Spidey, electrical shock!

17:30.925 --> 17:32.969
It was working earlier! Try...

17:32.969 --> 17:35.638
Who am I to ignore good advice?
[grunts]

17:35.638 --> 17:38.099
Power line, meet Venom.
Venom, power line!

17:38.099 --> 17:39.934
[screaming]

17:41.018 --> 17:43.104
[sighs]
Not enough juice.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.690
It's too easy for him
to get away from it!

17:45.690 --> 17:48.651
We were once bonded,
paired,

17:48.651 --> 17:50.278
and you rejected me!

17:50.278 --> 17:52.905
Is that what
this whole thing is about?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.575
Bonding to Eddie Brock?
Stalking me?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.119
All because I didn't
want to be your anger puppet?

17:58.119 --> 17:59.912
[growls]

17:59.912 --> 18:03.374
Together, you and I
could be so much,

18:03.374 --> 18:05.334
rule so much!

18:05.334 --> 18:07.753
We would be superior!

18:07.753 --> 18:10.715
Where have I heard
that line before?

18:10.715 --> 18:13.259
But if bonding with you
stops all this,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.136
then I guess
I have no choice.

18:15.136 --> 18:19.515
[growls]
You would be my host?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.143
If it'll save lives,
then yes.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.730
Besides, it might <i>overload</i>
my expectations.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.107
[growls]

18:28.107 --> 18:32.236
This is what I desire!

18:32.236 --> 18:35.281
We will be one!

18:35.281 --> 18:37.408
[roars]

18:37.408 --> 18:42.038
Spidey, one overload, coming up!
[grunts]

18:42.038 --> 18:44.915
Huh? What?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.752
[roaring]

18:49.670 --> 18:52.214
What is this?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.258
I will‐‐
[yells]

18:57.928 --> 18:59.513
Spidey!

18:59.513 --> 19:04.226
[groans]
I hate being the bait.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.646
But, hey, I've had
more disgusting wins.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.606
Actually, no.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.524
That was amazing.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.110
Oh, thank you, miss.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.446
Uh, I don't think
we've been introduced.

19:15.446 --> 19:19.367
No need to pretend, Peter.
I heard. I know it's you.

19:19.367 --> 19:24.205
Oh, uh, look, I know
this is going to sound strange.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.291
I am Peter Parker,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.585
but you and I
have never met.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.839
Ock, I brought
your friend.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.841
She's safe.
Flash too.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.095
<i>[static]</i>
<i>Thank you, Spider‐Man.</i>

<i>My real name is Otto,</i>

Not without a body to‐‐
Wait!

20:14.380 --> 20:16.424
There still might be time!

20:22.096 --> 20:25.182
Who is this?
Otto Octavius,

20:25.182 --> 20:27.268
the man who saved your life.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.270
This is his former body.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.314
And if we're lucky,
his future one.

20:37.945 --> 20:42.158
Did it work?
[monitor beeping]

20:42.158 --> 20:44.785
[beeping intensifies]
[Spider‐Man]
Increased brain activity.

20:44.785 --> 20:49.790
He's still in a coma,
but... I think his mind
is back where it should be.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.294
Everything you told me‐‐
it's nearly impossible
to believe.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.338
But one thing's for certain:
the Peter Parker I met,

20:56.338 --> 21:00.009
the man now in this body‐‐
he was a hero.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.221

How are you?

What do you care... Ock?

21:12.396 --> 21:15.399
Uh‐uh. Guess again.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.652
Peter?! No! No way!

Would you like to see me
dance the robot?

21:22.239 --> 21:25.451
Huh. I never thought
I would enjoy seeing that.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.623
Hello again, New York!
Spider‐Man is back!

21:30.623 --> 21:31.624
Whoo‐hoo!
