You wanna do the honors, Chambers?

00:35.368 --> 00:36.828
Hey, lady, I have rights.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.457
The only right you have now is
to... stay silent.

They're a small, but powerful group.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.784
-They feel GLOW is too... sexual.
-[scoffs]

01:15.867 --> 01:18.411

01:18.495 --> 01:21.289
You know,
and, uh, "the senseless violence,

01:21.372 --> 01:24.334
-explicit and tasteless sexuality,
-No.

01:24.459 --> 01:29.047
and promotion of the occult seen on GLOW
can have a lasting and dangerous effect

01:29.130 --> 01:31.466
on the youth of this country."
I don't know.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.594
-Wait, who's promoting the occult?
-[Bash and Debbie] Sheila.

01:35.303 --> 01:39.557
Well, the CWA lobbies
for more wholesome content.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.311
And if we don't, you know,
listen in some regard,

01:43.478 --> 01:45.438
they boycott our-- our sponsors.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.441
So, you're saying if we don't bend over,
no more Patio Town?

01:48.525 --> 01:51.069
[laughs] Not "bend over."

-[chuckles]

01:53.363 --> 01:54.531

01:54.614 --> 01:59.077
An easy fix would be to throw in
a positive message or two.

You know, show our characters

02:01.121 --> 02:03.832

a fucking public service announcement.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.794
That's great!

"Change the whole show.

to the task

Oh.

"The thrill can kill."
Or-- or-- or-- or... "Users are losers."

02:47.041 --> 02:48.877
Personally,
I think it's a great opportunity.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.255
If K-DTV likes the spot, they can run it
during their other shows,

because, instead,

ahead of her.

Are teenagers really having so much sex
that we need to make a PSA about it?

Yeah. Tons of stupid girls get pregnant.

but I'm on the pill. So, it's fine.

you mean, like...

Like, most days.

Like, whenever I see Billy.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.180
-[Dawn] Get fucked! Yeah!
-Get fucked!

11:21.263 --> 11:24.725
-[Dawn] Who are we fucking?
-[Rhonda] We can do it!

11:26.477 --> 11:28.479
-Hey, good morning.
-Good morning.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.732
I love that it's chilly out.
I get to break out my ankle boots.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.401
-Cute.
-[woman] Yeah.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.737
-[knock on door]
-[man] New pages for you.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.447
Thanks.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.911
Whoa! Whoa! Where-- where are my lines?

11:43.994 --> 11:48.207
Okay. So it looks like you'll be in here
for about an hour for the relaxer,

11:48.290 --> 11:53.170
-and maybe two more for the styling.
-What? Why? What's going on?

11:53.963 --> 11:56.757
Looks like the producers are making
some changes to your look.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.844
Uh-uh. No.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.096
I need to speak to the director.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.975
Someone needs to run this by me first
before you put that toxic shit on my head.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.728
I'm running it by you now.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.232
[sighs] Listen, honey,
I just do hair, but I hear a lot.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.025
And it seems to me like everyone

12:15.109 --> 12:16.986
around here's trying
to fix your character.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.739
If that includes straight hair,
I wouldn't fight it.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.157
That's just me.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.411
[gentle music playing]

12:26.912 --> 12:27.830
Good.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.098
[Cherry sniffling]

12:51.479 --> 12:54.148
-Good morning.
-Yeah. Let me see what I'm shooting.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.525
Okay.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.448
What the hell is a pre-coital...

13:03.157 --> 13:06.619
fantasy flashback? What is that?
I told you to keep it simple.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.995
It is simple. I timed it.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.748
Ten seconds over here, 20 seconds
over there, 40 seconds in the ring.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.541
-Done.
-Yeah, on the page.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.127
It's gonna take a half a day
to shoot this.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.463
-Who's playing the teenager?
-Justine.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.466
Well, who the fuck is gonna kiss her?

13:22.134 --> 13:25.304
Oh, no. No. Bash is not kissing her.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.431
Don't worry, she's safe.
She's on the pill.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.476
-I don't...
-If you wanna waste another half day

hey, be my guest.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.230
All right.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.650
-Fine. It's fine.
-Okay.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.735
Oh, you're welcome.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.447
Okay, listen.
Fellas, we're gonna shoot this fast.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.699
One size for each shot.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.953
No fancy camera movements. Capisce?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.873
Copy, loud and clear.
You're the boss, not the ladies.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.291
That's right.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.961
-That's right. All right.
-Absolutely.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.922
Hi, boys.

14:00.256 --> 14:04.009

It's gonna be wild. [chuckles]

14:04.093 --> 14:06.512
Sorry, I, uh... I have plans tonight.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.430
[Melrose] Oh, well...

14:08.514 --> 14:11.267
Okay. Well, I wasn't actually talking
to you, anyway. [chuckles]

14:11.642 --> 14:16.105
But if you have any hot guy friends,
send them over.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.022
I'll be there.

14:19.066 --> 14:19.984
Um...

14:23.737 --> 14:25.739

14:28.784 --> 14:30.995
Teen sex might sound sexy.

14:31.453 --> 14:35.374
But a baby you're not ready for...
Oh, that can really ruin your future.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.005
All right, that's it. Enough already.
Cut!

14:41.589 --> 14:42.840
Come on, moving on.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.425
Great. Moving on.

-[chuckles softly]
-[Keith] Sam? Hey.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.727
-What's going on?
-Oh, man. Cherry's in a bad place.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.980
This pretentious asshole director
doesn't understand her.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.774
She's locked herself in the trailer,
refusing to come to set.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.568
It's not my problem anymore.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Okay. Now look, man.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.574
Anytime you need Cherry,
she shows up for you.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.368
She taught a bunch of actresses
how to wrestle

15:11.452 --> 15:13.454
so you'd look like you knew
what you were doing.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.289
-Oh, what? So I owe her?
-Yes!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.377
She's got a lead role.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.923
And she's about to get fired.
And I don't know how to help her.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.262
[sighs]

15:30.512 --> 15:33.432
Hey, Debbie, do you think you can oversee

15:33.515 --> 15:35.601
the last 30 seconds
of your masterpiece here?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.227
Totally. Yeah, we got it covered.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.189
[laughing]

15:41.482 --> 15:42.441
I'm sorry.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.905
Cherry! Come on, baby, come out, Cherry!

15:48.364 --> 15:49.823
All right, all right, all right.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.535
Hey-- hey, Cherry, it's Sam.
You want to come out and talk?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.913
[Cherry]
I can't believe you brought him here!

15:55.996 --> 15:58.165
-He wants to help.
-[Cherry] Well, I'm not coming out.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.501
And you don't have to, baby. No pressure.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.503
She needs to get the fuck out
of that trailer.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.173
All right, all right. Listen, Cherry.
You don't have to come out.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.718
But why don't you just let me in,
and we can talk?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.595
[Cherry] Talk about what?

16:12.388 --> 16:13.973
[crying] I have no lines!

16:14.139 --> 16:17.977
My scalp's on fire!
They put all this shit in my hair!

16:18.060 --> 16:20.354
All right.
Well, can't you just wash it out?

16:22.523 --> 16:25.567
No, I can't wash it out! It's permanent.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.365
I got this job. So, I did something right.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.450
-Right?
-[both] Yeah.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.368
Yeah, yeah.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.579
But now, no one would explain
what the fuck I'm doing wrong!

You know what?

I'd just love to redo my narration.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.711
We can do that tomorrow,
or anytime.

You take off,
and Ruth and I can stay and finish.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.550
Really? Don't you have to go home?

No, I have a babysitter for tonight.

I've ever worked with.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.442
What?

23:24.611 --> 23:27.614
Oh, this is fucking bullshit.
That should've been me.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.492
[sighing]

23:30.575 --> 23:34.663
And finally, when all the joy
has been sucked out of your life,

23:34.996 --> 23:36.832
there is but one thing left.

23:38.625 --> 23:42.712
And finally, when all the joy
has been sucked out of your life,

23:42.838 --> 23:44.714
there is but one thing left.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.558
Okay, I think that'll do it.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.811
Done? What time is it?

23:58.603 --> 24:00.730
I don't know. Ten? Late?

24:01.398 --> 24:02.232
Who cares?

24:06.069 --> 24:07.154
Okay.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.661
Do you want to get some food?

24:15.036 --> 24:18.206
Celebrate our successful collaboration?

24:18.790 --> 24:21.168
It was a PSA. Carmen wore a diaper.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.087
Don't romanticize it.

24:24.504 --> 24:25.881
We could go to Du-Par's.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.134
-They're open late.
-I have to get home.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.303
Oh. [laughs]

24:33.388 --> 24:34.222
What?

24:35.682 --> 24:38.393
I just thought
maybe you didn't want to go home.

24:41.771 --> 24:42.939
[sighs]

24:45.817 --> 24:47.486
I have to let the babysitter go.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.156
See, I'm losing money every minute
I stand here talking to you.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.912
Sorry you missed your date with Russell.
