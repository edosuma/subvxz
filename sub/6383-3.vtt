00:00.400 --> 00:02.290
Previously on "Californication"...

00:02.300 --> 00:04.590
- So, Hank.
- Mereth.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.190
Have you written anything
I might have read?

00:06.200 --> 00:08.490
Well, that depends on whether
or not you read, meredith.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.890
The good people hell-a are very
interested in your thoughts.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.190
They would like you to blog for them.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.490
Jesus H.Christ.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.790
I am 16, you know.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.890
So I've been told.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.990
- Hi, d...!
- Honey, put some clothes on.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.090
We have company.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.390
Are you totally serious
about marrying bill?

00:27.400 --> 00:29.290
Yes.Why?

00:29.300 --> 00:30.590
What about hank?

00:30.600 --> 00:32.390
Game on, broheme.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.390
You want to get fucked up?

00:36.900 --> 00:38.790
Oh, god.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.190
- Must be weird, though.
- What?

00:42.200 --> 00:44.690
Becoming the employee of
a man you so clearly hate.

00:44.700 --> 00:45.890
What are you talking about?

00:45.900 --> 00:49.290
My father -- he
owns hell-a magazine.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.790
Once upon a time, I wrote a book.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.990
People seemed to dig
it, so I wrote another

01:00.000 --> 01:04.390
and one after that.That's when
hollywood came knocking at my back door.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.890
As soon as I cashed that check,

01:05.900 --> 01:10.990
I wrapped my lips around the mighty erection
that is the film industry and sucked hard --

01:11.000 --> 01:13.290
just like a good whore should.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.890
Unfortunately, I had to be
taught not to orphan the balls.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.190
Moody!

01:17.200 --> 01:20.390
Ladies and gentlemen, todd
carr -- the caramel-coated,

01:20.400 --> 01:24.490
chrome-domed auteur who took my
precious little novel, wiped his ass,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.890
and transformed it into
the craptastic crowd-pleaser

01:26.900 --> 01:30.990
also known as "crazy
little thing called love.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.990
" My people.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.090
You still bitching about whoring
yourself out to hollywood?

01:35.100 --> 01:37.190
Only when my pimp's not around.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.990
You're no goddamn fucking
faulkner, you know.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.490
And you're no brett fucking ratner.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.390
Although that could be a compliment,
and in that case, I didn't mean to.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.190
I'm sick of you talking
shit about me in the press.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.590
Oh, that's why you're here.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.490
I thought you might have come by

01:50.500 --> 01:53.790
because you found out I fucked your
wife in almost every room of your house.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.190
No?Every room of your house.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.690
And I'm sorry about the rug.I didn't
realize the old lady was a squirter.

Californication
Season 1 Episode 03

03:07.900 --> 03:09.490
Hank.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.790
Where's karen?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.890
Home, with becca.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.290
She's funny, that one.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.090
- Becca?Yeah, she is a
real character. -No --

03:17.100 --> 03:18.290
karen.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.090
She knows how to push my all buttons.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.490
I don't think she's trying
to push your buttons, hank.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.290
Bill, I'm not really interested in what
you think, but thank you for sharing.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.190
I wanted to come.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.390
You did?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.690
I'm not the bad guy.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.290
You're not the bad guy?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.590
Life is complicated, man.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.490
"Life is complicated,
man." That's what you got?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.690
Way to dip into the platitudes.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.990
I guess that's why
you're the writer, hank.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.390
Oh, fuck.I didn't ask for you
to fucking come bail me out.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.290
I didn't ask for a fucking job.I don't
know who the fuck you think you are.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.590
You think I'm dying to
be in business with you?

03:50.700 --> 03:54.890
Some rude, disrespectful jackass
who can't get out of his own way?

03:54.900 --> 03:57.090
You looking for a dick punch?

03:57.100 --> 03:59.090
Do you want to punch me in the dick?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.190
I kind of do, yeah,

04:00.200 --> 04:02.790
but standing here talking about it
is beginning to sound kind of gay.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.890
Go ahead.Take a
shot.But think --

04:06.100 --> 04:08.490
would you want becca to see this?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.590
I'll settle for a titty twister.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.089
God.You're 11.

04:16.700 --> 04:17.690
Fuck.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.690
Keep the job, hank.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.290
Get back on your feet.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.890
Get on with your life.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.490
And forget about the woman
you didn't want to marry.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.190
Don't make me get up and kick
your ass all over again, bill!

05:14.100 --> 05:16.190
hi.Remember me?

05:16.900 --> 05:17.990
How could I forget?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.090
Best blind date of my life, asshole.

05:20.100 --> 05:20.990
We don't have much time.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.990
Your suitor will be returning
from the shitter posthaste,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.790
but in his absence, I would like
to offer my sincere apologies.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.690
My behavior the other night was beyond
appalling, despicable, reprehensible.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.090
I was a mess.I have no words.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.990
For a guy with no words,
that was a lot of words.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.090
That's funny.I-I wouldn't
have expected that from you.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.590
Because you had me so nailed.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.590
Well, let me make it up to you.Let
me -- can I...take you out sometime?

05:47.700 --> 05:51.690
I'm out right now -- with
a guy who's not an asshole.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.990
Right.Well, do you see
yourself marrying this fella?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.290
You never know.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.690
Girls know in a matter of seconds whether
they want to fuck, marry, or kill a guy.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.490
Which begs the question, how am I doing?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.090
Bye now.

06:05.900 --> 06:10.090
Be good to her, my friend.I had a
shot with her once, but I blew it.

06:10.100 --> 06:16.390
Hang out with your wang out, but
remember -- no gloving, no loving.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.890
Au revoir, mes enfants.***

06:28.600 --> 06:29.890
So...

06:30.400 --> 06:32.390
you were brought up on the east coast.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.090
Jersey maybe.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.890
No -- long
island.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.590
Dad had a chip on his
shoulder, blue on his collar.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.390
Mom was a little beat down by it all,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.690
but she was the one who
encouraged you to dream big.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.890
They fought like cats and dogs,

06:43.900 --> 06:46.590
but they stayed together
through good times and bad.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.490
You had sisters.You learned about girls.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.290
You were good with them
-- maybe a little too good.

06:53.300 --> 06:57.490
You read books, and you didn't want to
die five miles from where you were born.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.790
So you escaped into the
city you romanticized

06:59.800 --> 07:03.090
and reinvented yourself
as a poor man's mcinerney.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.990
How am I doing?

07:05.700 --> 07:09.090
Pretty good -- a lot
more gracious than mine.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.190
I-I blacked out there in the middle,

07:11.200 --> 07:15.190
when you were really strumming
my pain with your fingers, but...

07:15.500 --> 07:17.190
well done.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.390
How long you been working on that?

07:19.800 --> 07:21.390
A couple of weeks.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.190
It's a good story.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.890
Any idea how it ends?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.190
Hey, where are you going?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.890
I have to get to work.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.590
A job?What do you do?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.790
Well, don't you remember?I'm
a poor gal's martha stewart.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.390
Don't you remember I'm an asshole?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.690
Right.I'm an attorney.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.090
Oh, then we're both assholes.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.590
What's your thing?

08:14.600 --> 08:15.990
Divorce.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.490
Aye, you must be a busy girl.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.490
That I am, which is
why I have to skedaddle.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.790
I can't believe you were trying to slink
out of here without saying goodbye to me.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.990
Hank.Please.I assume
this was a one-time thing.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.390
Why would you assume
something like that?

08:33.500 --> 08:37.090
No offense, but you don't seem like the kind of
guy who's looking for a lot of repeat business.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.590
I'm offended.How about tonight?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.890
Are you sure?

08:40.900 --> 08:45.590
Yeah, a proper date --
dinner, 20th-century style.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.890
I'd be just as happy to come back here.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.390
No.No, no, no.Dinner.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.890
A girl's got to eat.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.190
That she does.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.790
are you gonna flush?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.790
What the fuck are you doing here?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.390
The redhead let me in.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.390
Question -- does the carpet
match the drapes, hanky-panky?

09:33.400 --> 09:34.590
You scared the shit out of me.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.190
I know.You screamed
just like a little girl.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.690
Kind of a turnoff, actually.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.390
What the fuck do you want?

09:40.400 --> 09:43.490
- I'm late.
- What?!That's not possible.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.390
I-I-I wore
a condom.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.490
That's -- that would be like
the immaculate conception.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.990
And you -- you're the one who
-- y-you -- and then you left.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.390
I'm late for school.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.790
Okay.Well, then, what do you
want from me, besides the obvious?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.690
Don't flatter yourself, champ.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.690
I have a creative-writing course, and
I need to turn something in today, so...

10:07.700 --> 10:09.190
okay, what's the problem?

10:09.200 --> 10:12.790
It's creative writing.Be
creative.Write something.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.390
This from a guy who hasn't
written a word in five years?

10:16.400 --> 10:17.690
Nobody likes a smartass.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.590
You must have some piece-of-shit short story
you nevepublished around here somewhere.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.690
No.No, nothing.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.590
Hank?

10:25.800 --> 10:32.890
Stop that.And don't move.Don't
fuck around.Do not fuck around!

10:32.900 --> 10:34.790
It's not funny.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.190
Hey, look who's here.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.990
***You don't call.You don't write.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.590
- You look like shit. -
And you look beautiful --

10:45.600 --> 10:48.590
far too beautiful for these four
walls.Let's go out and get some breakfast.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.990
- I'm getting coffee.
- No, we'll go out.We'll get it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.390
- Get dressed.
- Fuck!

10:58.200 --> 10:59.490
- Hank?
- Yeah?

10:59.800 --> 11:02.090
I just
wanted --

11:04.000 --> 11:05.590
what, no points for safety?

11:05.600 --> 11:08.190
Yes, but magnums?Wow.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.090
Yeah, well, you know.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.690
Did you have a growth spurt?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.990
Well, no, I been --
I been working out.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.990
Just a lot of vitamins.I
got whole -- I got a regimen.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.090
Hank, do not quit this job.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.890
It's hardly a job, karen.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.190
It's a blog.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.890
It's by far the best thing that's happened
to you in a long time, and you're good at it.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.690
Well, I just can't work for bill.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.290
Why not?

11:31.300 --> 11:33.490
Well, for one, he's a dick.

11:33.500 --> 11:37.790
Could you just swallow your
stupid pride and keep the job,

11:37.800 --> 11:40.590
keep writing, keep doing what
you were put on this planet to do?

11:40.600 --> 11:45.590
What else is there for you besides
drowning in a sea of pointless pussy?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.790
- It's the neighbors.
- Okay.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.590
Do you know what?I should go in there.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.790
- I'm gonna go in there.
- no

11:55.800 --> 11:59.590
I'm gonna go in there and tell her
what to expect and how to treat it.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.590
It's only fair.

12:00.600 --> 12:05.690
There are some images you don't want
floating around your pretty little head.

12:05.700 --> 12:10.990
Trust me, it's like a mapplethorpe
shoot in there, except with less cock.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.490
Shut up, okay?Shut up.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.590
Keep the job, hank.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.690
Do it for becca's sake.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.090
Give her something to look up to.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.790
Thanks for stopping by.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.090
Just suppose you're a guy and you're
getting a massage from another guy,

12:53.100 --> 12:55.290
and it's nice, it's relaxing.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.490
Then all of a sudden, you get a little
tingle, a little unintentional stim.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.990
What do you call that, where
you get a little turgidity?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.490
You know, you get a
rollover going there.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.390
That was nora from hell-a magazine.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.190
She wants to know when she
can expect the new piece.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.690
What would you call that phenomenon?

13:11.700 --> 13:15.690
Hank, the whole idea behind the
blog is an ongoing narrative.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.590
You understand?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.690
A series of events that follows
another series of events.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.490
I get that.I get that.I really do.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.090
I just can't whore myself
out to the tall man anymore.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.990
Ongoing or not, I can't do it.Capisce?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.290
With all due respect, hank,
grow the fuck up already.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.390
Come on, you're the lying cocksucker
that got me into this in the first place.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.790
You set me up.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.890
If by set you up,

13:36.900 --> 13:41.090
you mean contrive a situation in which you
might actually start to produce words again,

13:41.100 --> 13:42.890
then, yes, okay, guilty as charged.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.290
You should have told me what
you were up to.That was bullshit.

13:46.300 --> 13:50.390
You wouldn't have done it!Okay, you
see?You see what I'm getting at here?

13:50.400 --> 13:52.590
Oh, fuck you.You're fired.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.390
You know that you've fired me roughly every
90 days since we started to work together.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.390
Yeah, because I'm a
consistent motherfucker.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.590
Don't do this, hank, okay?Not now.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.790
No other agent in their right mind
would take you on at this point.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.090
And the ones who would wouldn't be able
to get you a job writing kiddy porn.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.690
Yeah, we'll see about that.It's
a broner.It's a broner --

14:13.700 --> 14:14.890
the word I'm looking for.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.790
Unintentionally
man-inspired boner --

14:16.800 --> 14:19.690
broner.Duly noted.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.990
Broner!

14:25.000 --> 14:29.090
What is so fucking difficult about
distinguishing diet from regular, huh?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.990
Here.Just go.You're fired, all right?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.890
Get out.Go!Fucking get out of here!

14:43.100 --> 14:45.390
You okay there, tiger?

14:46.900 --> 14:49.590
Did you ever have one of those
days where you feel like a tired,

14:49.600 --> 14:52.990
old whore whose uterus
is about to fall out?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.090
I think I'm in touch with that emotion.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.490
Really?I was just
being dramatic.Do tell.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.990
That guy you saw me with last night?

15:02.100 --> 15:03.290
He's married.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.090
Oh, you dirty cheater, you.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.290
Five years.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.990
Been fucking a married
guy for five years?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.790
Classy, huh?

15:12.200 --> 15:16.390
I tend to think of myself as a
whatever-makes-you-happy kind of a guy,

15:16.400 --> 15:20.990
but I have to ask --
what's in it for you, lady?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.090
I love him.

15:23.100 --> 15:26.090
And I tend to believe him
when he says he loves me.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.190
That sounds like a
charming little romcom,

15:29.200 --> 15:32.090
except for the part where
he won't leave his wife.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.490
The guy's richer than god.He
doesn't want to cut it in half.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.890
I haven't known you very long,

15:36.900 --> 15:39.590
and this probably means
precious little coming from a guy

15:39.600 --> 15:43.790
who treated you like a piece
of prison ass on a blind date,

15:43.800 --> 15:47.090
but I think you deserve
a hell of a lot more.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.790
My baby.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.890
You have a baby with the
married guy?Holy fuck.

15:55.900 --> 15:59.490
No, my dog...

15:59.800 --> 16:01.790
cat stevens.

16:01.800 --> 16:07.390
You have a dog named
cat stevens.Holy fuck!

16:09.100 --> 16:11.690
A gift from married guy.

16:12.100 --> 16:16.890
I know it sounds incredibly
lame, but he was like our baby.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.890
The one thing that
was ours -- just ours.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.590
So, his wife goes out of town, and I
bring cat stevens over to the house.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.190
Naturally, the bitch comes home early.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.190
I barely have enough time to put on
my clothes and sneak out the back.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.790
And then I realized I left him behind.

16:35.800 --> 16:40.290
That fucking bitch thought sweet
little cat stevens was a gift for her.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.090
Married guy doesn't say anything?

16:43.100 --> 16:45.290
How could he?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.490
Hmm, that is sick.Come on.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.990
Where are we going?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.290
We're gonna fix this.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.890
i'm sorry***

18:19.800 --> 18:21.890
Hey, honey.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.290
You're insane.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.690
You've been fucking a
married guy for five years,

18:36.700 --> 18:39.490
you've got a dog named cat
stevens, and I'm insane?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.490
Point taken.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.390
I got to figure out a way to get in there
without breaking a window or something like that.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.190
How about this?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.190
Cat?

19:03.700 --> 19:06.090
And you'll never have dried-up
meat in the refrigerator.

19:06.100 --> 19:10.490
Hey.Cat stevens.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.790
Come here, cat.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.400
Roast beef, lamb, turkey.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.890
This knife is like a hot knife
going right through butter.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.990
It has a fork with the end, so you
pick up the meat, dip it into the gravy.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.090
Remember, here's a
grapefruit.Look at this.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.990
Not a seed, not a drop
of juice comes out.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.590
Come here.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.490
I'll take you away from all this.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.390
Cat!Yusuf islam!

19:37.300 --> 19:41.890
"Be straight" is a good song.Come
here, cat.Come here.Come on.

19:56.500 --> 20:01.490
Go!Go!Go.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.490
Go, go, go.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.490
Don't worry, I'll be gone
for good in a few minutes.

20:13.500 --> 20:19.290
actually, I was, um --
I was gonna call you.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.090
You could've e-mailed.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.090
I-I think I overreacted yesterday,

20:25.100 --> 20:31.990
and I'm sorry about that,
so, uh, the job is yours if --

20:32.000 --> 20:33.790
if you still want it.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.890
I want it.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.590
Good.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.390
But...

20:40.400 --> 20:42.790
but?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.490
From now on, if I make a
mistake or I screw something up,

20:47.500 --> 20:52.190
you should feel free to discipline
me in whatever way you see fit.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.790
You're the boss.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.490
Oh, and, um, hank called.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.590
He said you could still
be his agent if you want.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.190
I thought that was you.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.190
I would have focused on a
different area altogether.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.290
Get your ass back in bed then.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.890
I got to go to work.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.290
Ah, yes, I don't think I've ever
dated a woman who had a job before.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.290
Is that what we're doing?Dating?

21:41.100 --> 21:47.090
It does feel that way -- kind
of, sort of, maybe, a little bit.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.990
Yeah.I guess it kind of does.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.890
Too many tongues.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.890
Hey, take your fucking dog.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.890
I didn't have the heart to tell
you, but that's not cat stevens.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.090
What?

22:04.100 --> 22:05.490
You took the wrong dog.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.690
So not your fault -- the
bitch has a lot of them.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.190
Look on the bright side.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.190
He seems to really like you.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.990
Thank you.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.190
This is not a macchiato.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.890
A
macchiato --

22:34.600 --> 22:39.290
what am I going to do with you?

22:39.300 --> 22:41.990
Whatever you want, boss.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.390
Look what a mess I've made.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.590
Guess who.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.190
something's familiar.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.090
Did you switch to camel lights?

23:35.400 --> 23:37.590
that's cute.What you reading?

23:37.600 --> 23:41.690
Oh, you're not gonna go through
with that barbaric ritual, are you?

23:41.700 --> 23:43.590
I was thinking about it.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.090
You don't sound too excited.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.990
I am.It's just weird.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.390
I never thought I'd get married.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.290
You had me convinced it was
all a bullshit fairy tale.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.290
And it's not?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.190
Not if you meet the right person.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.390
You say it's about meeting mr.Right.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.390
I think you're settling for
mr.Right in front of you.

24:01.400 --> 24:05.390
I'm asking you to consider
mr.Lurking right above you.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.690
Hank, hank, hankie.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.890
I wouldn't want to erase the fact that,
once upon a time, I used to love you.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.090
But
--

24:14.100 --> 24:15.090
Hank!

24:15.100 --> 24:16.190
Hello.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.390
William.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.890
I-I have something for you.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.890
Hank, uh, hank, you
didn't have to do this.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.990
Considering I got my precious
bodily fluids all over yours,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.390
I felt like, yeah, I kind of did.

24:29.400 --> 24:35.190
But that piece of, um, art
is worth a small fortune.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.190
Don't look a gift piece of
overpriced pop art in the mouth.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.090
I know people who know
people.Just enjoy it.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.090
Consider it a belated
engagement present.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.490
Hang it over your marital bed.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.290
What's up with you?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.990
You seem
kind of, um --

24:50.000 --> 24:51.290
- jaunty?
- Yes.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.790
- Devil-may-care?
- Yes.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.790
- Happy?
- Even.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.190
Well, maybe I met a girl.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.390
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, honey.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.690
I've got something for you,
too.Just hold on.Stay right there.

25:05.700 --> 25:09.190
I'm partial to yusuf islam, but
you can call him whatever you want.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.090
And, bill, don't
worry.He can stay with me.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.690
That's so nice of you, hank.

25:13.700 --> 25:16.590
Yes, hank, that's very nice of you.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.590
Well, you guys look like one big happy.

25:20.600 --> 25:25.290
I am proud to report that my daughter has just
penned one of the most impressive short stories

25:25.300 --> 25:27.590
I have ever had the pleasure of reading.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.190
Now, the prose was a bit on
the purple side, but still,

25:31.200 --> 25:33.590
I had no idea she had it in her.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.190
I'm sure the prose wasn't that purple.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.990
No, it was, but still,
it was good stuff.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.790
That is something.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.990
Well, it's what I do.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.090
Speaking of which, dare
I ask about the blog?

25:48.500 --> 25:53.990
Honey, to quote the clash, should
I stay or should I rock the casbah?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.990
Do what you want, dad.I
love you no matter what.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.790
Good morning, hell-A.

26:03.300 --> 26:07.090
In the land of the lotus-eaters,
time plays tricks on you.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.590
One day you're dreaming.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.990
The next, your dream
has become your reality.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.090
It was the best of times.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.990
If only someone had told me.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.790
Mistakes were made, hearts were
broken, harsh lessons learned.

26:24.100 --> 26:31.190
My family goes on without me, while
I drown in a sea of pointless pussy.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.590
I don't know how I got here.

26:35.600 --> 26:41.290
But here I am, rotting away
in the warm california sun.

26:41.300 --> 26:46.290
There are things I need to figure
out, for her sake, at least.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.190
The clock is ticking.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.590
The gap is widening.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.990
She won't always love me no matter what.
