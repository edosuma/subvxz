(DANIEL GROANS)

00:22.760 --> 00:24.380
What are you doing back there?

00:24.440 --> 00:25.940
None of them are chilled.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.340
Uh, it's 10am and you're drinking.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.940
The temperature is the least
of your problems.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.940
I'm not drinking it.
Wuss! I'll drink it.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.500
No, it's for Brian,
who bought 29 Stafford Street.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.700
I bought a bunch, but I forgot
to put them in the fridge.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.620
Hopefully it'll chill
before he gets here.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.620
Do we shake it and spray it on him
like race car drivers?

00:41.680 --> 00:43.180
Or does he spray it on us?

00:43.240 --> 00:45.620
We give it to him
and he drinks it at home.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.500
Pfft! Boring!

00:47.560 --> 00:50.220
Oh, we got another inquiry
for Farland Street too.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.260
Oh, really? That's great.
Did they find us on the website?

00:53.320 --> 00:54.740
They did.
Mmm!

00:54.800 --> 00:56.380
I told you
updating it was a good idea.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.620
Did I tell you Mum actually said
"good job" to me yesterday?

00:58.680 --> 00:59.980
You told me many times.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.140
Just thought I did a good job,
said, "Good job."

01:02.200 --> 01:04.420
So what? I found five bucks
in my jeans.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.940
Oh, that's mine. I lost five bucks.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.940
In my jeans?
Yes. They look good on me.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.580
(PHONE DINGS)

01:09.640 --> 01:10.820
Oh, sweet!

01:10.880 --> 01:13.020
What?
We got a review.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.380
What review?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.900
I listed us on Google
so people could leave reviews online.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.940
We just got our first one.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.940
Oh! Well, this calls for champagne.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.340
Just buy your own.
It's 10am.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.060
I don't want the bottle shop guy
thinking less of me

01:23.120 --> 01:24.780
than he already does.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.900
Actually, Mrs Marsh,
can you read it, please?

01:26.960 --> 01:28.700
"Very unprofessional."

01:28.760 --> 01:30.060
What?!

01:30.120 --> 01:31.580
One star?!

01:31.640 --> 01:33.340
(CORK POPS)
Whoo!

01:33.400 --> 01:35.220
One star isn't good.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.700
Well, it's open now.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.900
# Yeah, we know

01:48.960 --> 01:52.660
# Even if we had so far to go

01:52.720 --> 01:55.740
# Even if the pace is slow

01:55.800 --> 01:58.900
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again

02:01.080 --> 02:03.700
# If we find

02:03.760 --> 02:07.660
# Something to feel that we belong

02:07.720 --> 02:10.780
# If we could right all the wrongs

02:10.840 --> 02:14.020
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again. #

02:20.880 --> 02:24.180
Don't worry about it.
Even Space Jam got bad reviews.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.780
Whenever someone searches for us,
"very unprofessional" will come up.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.500
You know, we're salespeople.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.580
No-one's gonna want to list with us
if they read that.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.460
At least they're searching for us.
And it's only one review.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.060
Yeah, but we don't have
any other ones.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.300
And we can't take it down either.
It's just up there forever.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.100
They didn't even
have to provide proof.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.260
They just put it up
and, boom, we're unprofessional.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.380
I'll put one up.
"Very professional. Six stars."

02:45.440 --> 02:47.900
No, if someone finds out
you work here, it'll look worse.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.620
We need to find...

02:49.680 --> 02:51.740
..Mel and get them
to take it down.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.060
Have you ever been in contact
with someone called Mel?

02:54.120 --> 02:55.180
Don't think so.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.820
Well, you must have
dealt with someone.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.980
Why me?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.900
I say this with the utmost respect,

03:00.960 --> 03:03.180
but if someone was gonna
write a review

03:03.240 --> 03:05.820
about someone in the office
not being professional,

03:05.880 --> 03:06.940
it's probably gonna be about

03:07.000 --> 03:09.020
the person with the stegosaurus
on their desk.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.620
You bought me that.
But not to put on your desk.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.540
Maybe the review was about you.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.180
(SCOFFS) Well, I doubt it.
Mum said "good job", remember?

03:16.240 --> 03:19.180
Well, it could have been
about Barbara. Or Mrs Marsh.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.580
We don't know.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.780
Maybe Mel's another realtor
who's trying to tear us apart

03:22.840 --> 03:24.460
and this is exactly what she wants.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.380
How would you feel
about wearing a blazer?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.060
Pig.
Well, it's just a thought.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.860
It wouldn't be all the time...
No, look, there's a pig.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.180
What?

03:32.240 --> 03:34.660
Oh, just ignore it. It'll go away.
Ignore it?

03:34.720 --> 03:37.340
If we look at it, it's our problem.
If we don't, it's someone else's.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.740
I'm already looking at it.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.460
Let's just focus on
being more professional.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.820
Absolutely.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.340
Right after I make friends
with this pig.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.620
No. Em...
Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig!

03:45.680 --> 03:47.860
(SHOP BELL RINGS)
Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig!

03:49.920 --> 03:51.820
Oh! Look at it!

03:51.880 --> 03:53.020
Just leave it.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.460
I think it's lost.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.060
Maybe it knows
exactly what it's doing

03:56.120 --> 03:57.420
and you're disturbing its plans.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.540
Maybe its plans are
to find new friends.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.700
You did it!

04:00.760 --> 04:02.620
Someone will own it.
It'll probably just walk home.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.740
Let's bring it into the office.
I don't think Mum will like that.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.580
Well, she didn't like me
at first either.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.580
Yeah, but you're not a pig.
What if it gets hit by a car?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.180
It managed to get this far just fine.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.140
Can you just go in the kitchen
and get some snacks?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.580
We don't have any pig food.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.340
All food is pig food. Just do it.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.300
How many bad reviews will we get if
people found out we let a pig die?

04:18.360 --> 04:19.620
(SCOFFS) That won't happen.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.460
It will, because
I'll be the one writing them.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.460
I'll bring us down from the inside.
Don't think I won't.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.740
(GROANS)

04:25.640 --> 04:28.100
Hey, buddy. Do you want to
come in the office?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.900
You want to come? Come on, Daniel!
Coming!

04:31.960 --> 04:34.220
Tea bags?!
You said all food is pig food.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.860
Fine. Hold the door.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.460
You want to come in?
Yeah, that's it. Come on.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.300
Oh! It's nice in the office.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.820
Well, this is great.
It's working!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.620
This'll give us the edge
over other agencies.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.140
Good boy, yes!

04:45.200 --> 04:46.660
Ohh, walking, walking.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.940
Shut the door!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.500
That's my desk. Yes, it's mine.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.420
Mrs Marsh, do you know
who might own this pig?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.420
It might be from the butcher.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.420
Oh, of course, the butcher.
So I'll give them a call.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.020
No! You can't call the butcher.
What if he's escaped?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.860
That's why I'm calling the butcher.
The butcher will kill him!

05:03.920 --> 05:06.060
Em, you eat bacon all the time.
You had some on the weekend.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.180
No, I ate YOUR bacon.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.860
So, technically, you killed a pig

05:09.920 --> 05:11.700
and I was just making sure
it didn't die in vain.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.580
(SCOFFS)
Just wait!

05:13.640 --> 05:16.900
Please don't call the butcher.
I haven't made a mistake in ages.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.420
Please, can I just hang out
with a pig? Just for a bit?

05:19.480 --> 05:22.260
(PIG GRUNTS)

05:25.000 --> 05:26.700
(GRUNTS)

05:26.760 --> 05:29.220
Oh, he's so thirsty!

05:29.280 --> 05:32.060
Maybe he's wild.
Does Tasmania have wild pigs?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.580
I don't think so.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.700
Wild pig. Out there in the wild.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.500
You've seen some things.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.180
Oh! One star!

05:40.240 --> 05:42.100
Do you think they even care
who they're hurting?

05:42.160 --> 05:43.820
Like, what the consequences are?

05:43.880 --> 05:47.220
Mrs Marsh, have you ever come
in contact with someone called Mel?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.540
No.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.340
OK, could you do a search
of all our records

05:50.400 --> 05:54.220
and see if we've ever dealt with, or
are dealing with, someone called Mel?

05:54.280 --> 05:56.900
Possibly short for Melissa,
or Melinda, or...

05:59.760 --> 06:01.500
You could check the computer.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.900
There's a Melvin
at the Kemp Street flat.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.420
The fox terrier?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.100
Well, you never pat him.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.020
Any luck?

06:18.200 --> 06:19.500
He needs a name.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.220
No.
He looks like a George.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.500
Hi, George!

06:23.560 --> 06:25.700
His name is 'generic pig
that we have to give back'.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.380
He doesn't mean it, George.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.020
You're cleaning it up
if he poos or wees anywhere.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.380
So you're cleaning vomit?
No, no.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.100
Anything out of any hole
is your responsibility.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.660
Hi, Mum. How are you?

06:33.720 --> 06:36.220
Why is there a pig in my office?

06:36.280 --> 06:37.820
What did you call me?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.220
He was lost.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.780
Right, so he just opened the door
and walked in, did he?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.980
Well, uh, we...coaxed him in.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.820
Um...one of us more than the other.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.300
Have you called the butcher?
We're not calling the butcher.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.660
What's the problem? You eat bacon.
Not anymore.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.460
Neither does Daniel.
I haven't agreed to that.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.180
Well, if it belongs to the butcher,
we just have to return it.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.060
As inconvenient as it might seem,
theft is illegal.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.540
What if they kill George?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.580
George?

07:00.640 --> 07:01.940
Emma named him.
Mrs Marsh named him.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.300
Oh, God!

07:03.360 --> 07:05.020
What if he's someone pet?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.500
Don't get your hopes up.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.820
Um, Mum, we have another problem.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.780
Is there a cow in the kitchenette?

07:09.840 --> 07:12.460
No. We got a one-star review.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.260
What are you talking about?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.500
If you look up McCallum Real Estate
online,

07:16.560 --> 07:20.020
next to our office is
a one-star review, out of five.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.300
So?

07:21.360 --> 07:22.940
Well, they said
we were "very unprofessional".

07:23.000 --> 07:24.500
Who said that?
Mel.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.220
Mel who?
Well, we don't know.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.660
Have you worked with or are
you working with someone called Mel?

07:28.720 --> 07:30.500
Could be a fake name.
Oh, could be a fake name.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.100
I don't care what some random person
on the internet said.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.540
It's our only review.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.740
If you're so worried
about being unprofessional,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.180
don't bring a pig into the office.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.980
I agree. It was her idea.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.820
Go and buy a leash and a blanket.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.820
Are we keeping him?
No.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.580
We're gonna tie him up outside
until I can figure out who owns him.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.060
You've seen Babe.
They don't need leashes.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.700
It wasn't a doco.
Go.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.820
I'll stay and keep him company.
No, you don't.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.380
I don't want you getting
any more attached.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.820
Can you send me photos
if he does something cute?

07:58.320 --> 08:00.420
Sorry, I mean
WHEN he does something cute.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.780
(DOOR CLOSES)

08:08.480 --> 08:10.580
I don't think Mum understands
what a big deal this is.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.300
I know! In some cultures, a pig
in the office is probably good luck.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.900
No, I'm talking about the review.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.220
Still? You can't control
what people say about you online.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.100
I could post a 10-minute video
talking about how much you stink.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.700
I'll post an 11-minute video
talking about how much YOU stink.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.660
We should make a video about George.
While we can.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.260
I know it sucks, but Mum's right.
We need to find out who owns him.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.180
What if someone was gonna eat you
and you escaped

08:34.240 --> 08:36.660
and then some strangers were trying
to take you back to get eaten?

08:36.720 --> 08:39.100
Well, if I was a pig, I don't think I
could comprehend what was happening,

08:39.160 --> 08:40.420
so I probably wouldn't care.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.980
Pigs are really smart, you know.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.500
Can they track people?
Maybe he can find Mel.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.180
Mel's not a truffle.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.620
You're not gonna let this go,
are you?

08:47.680 --> 08:48.740
We got one star!

08:48.800 --> 08:50.380
And now we've got a pig
running around the office,

08:50.440 --> 08:51.540
we'll probably get more bad ones.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.380
Look, if it makes you feel
any better,

08:53.440 --> 08:55.620
let's get George
a little shirt and tie.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.700
Or you could wear a blazer
like I suggested.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.540
What's wrong with what I wear?

09:03.080 --> 09:04.740
It's...it's a little casual.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.180
Yeah. My look is approachable,
functional, yet comfortable.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.820
Basically, it's cardigans.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.340
I just want us to look like
we know what we're doing.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.180
Steve Jobs wore turtlenecks.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.100
And The Wiggles.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.100
Are you gonna start
wearing turtlenecks now?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.660
No! Gross.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.620
This place is huge!

09:28.680 --> 09:30.740
Do you need any worming tablets?
No, I'm good.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.100
What colour leash should we get him?
I don't think he'll mind.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.020
It doesn't really matter.
We're not keeping him.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.620
WOMAN: Hi. Do you guys need a hand?

09:36.680 --> 09:38.580
We've got a special
on feedbags today.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.420
Two feedbags for the price
of one and a half feedbags.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.540
We need a leash for a pig
about this big,

09:43.600 --> 09:44.940
but it doesn't matter what colour,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.660
because Daniel doesn't care
if it lives or dies.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.100
This is Daniel.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.580
We also need a blanket.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.980
Sure.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.500
I'd recommend something like...this.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.700
Cheap but sturdy if you're not
gonna be needing it long.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.900
Oh, 'cause he'll be dead soon?
I mean, you can say it.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.540
We're not gonna need it long
because we're going to kill George.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.460
So Daniel can eat him, probably.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.140
Daniel. Right here.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.700
I'm sorry, is the pig a pet or...?
Oh, no, it's not a pet.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.100
And if you're looking to slaughter,
our man Gary can cut him up for you.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.780
Oh, no, no, thank you.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.980
Has anyone come in today
asking about a pig they lost?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.460
No.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.460
Right. Uh, then just
the leash, please.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.980
And a blanket, just enough
to make sure he stays warm outside.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.700
Oh, so you care if he's warm
but not if he's dinner?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.460
Why don't we skip the blanket
and get him an oven?

10:25.520 --> 10:28.620
We had chicken parmas two weeks ago,
with ham, and you finished off mine.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.220
That was before I met this pig.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.260
Oh, so you thought
ham was vegetarian? It's not.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.740
It doesn't grow on plants.
It grows on...pigs.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.180
Is that everything?

10:39.240 --> 10:43.340
Um...I don't suppose
the owner is around?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.900
Uh, hi... Bob?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.500
Yes.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.420
Are you the owner here?

10:50.480 --> 10:52.980
I am. Is there a problem?

10:53.040 --> 10:54.540
Oh, no, no,
I actually just wanted to say

10:54.600 --> 10:56.220
I had an excellent time
in the store today.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.540
Very helpful staff.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.620
Ah. Well, that's good to hear.
Yeah, no worries.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.900
I'll certainly be leaving
a glowing review online.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.580
Excuse me?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.260
Uh, just when you search
Western Animal Supplies,

11:05.320 --> 11:07.980
you'll see my review up there
with five stars, of course.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.060
Oh, right. Thanks.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.300
Uh, no worries.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.820
Listen, I'm from McCallum
Real Estate - two Cs, two Ls,

11:13.880 --> 11:15.860
and I was just wondering,
if I left you a good review,

11:15.920 --> 11:17.660
would you consider leaving us one?

11:17.720 --> 11:18.940
Only if you wanted to.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.020
I just think it's a great way

11:20.080 --> 11:22.660
for small businesses like ours
to help each other out.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.100
Listen, mate,
I've got a lot of work to do.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.940
You know, we've got the special
on feedbags.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.340
Oh, yeah, and it's a great deal.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.220
Yep, sorry to interrupt.
Just a thought.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.140
Um, thanks again for having me,

11:32.200 --> 11:34.860
and I'll...I'll post that review
now, so...

11:36.040 --> 11:37.940
See you later.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.300
I got a blue one.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.260
You're right. I do like ham.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.940
And bacon. Burgers. Meatballs.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.380
I just don't think about it.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.740
I know I'm a hypocrite,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.820
but I just met an animal
and I don't want it to die.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.140
Is that so crazy?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.340
Mum asked me to help
prepare a chicken once.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.500
It still had its feathers on it,
and I just...I couldn't do it.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.420
Ended up just having salad
that night.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.260
I still feel bad,
'cause it had eggs in it.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.860
The chicken had eggs in it?
No, the salad.

12:26.320 --> 12:29.100
Maybe George is someone's pet.
He's pretty fit-looking.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.980
Could be 'cause
he goes on heaps of walks.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.580
Maybe that's why he hasn't gone
to the toilet on the floor yet,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.500
'cause he knows
how to behave indoors.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.860
And he likes herbal tea,
so he's fancy.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.100
Maybe he lives in a mansion.
(PHONE DINGS)

12:40.160 --> 12:41.540
Oh. Got another review.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.580
What's it say?

12:43.640 --> 12:46.340
"McCallum Real Estate just tried
to elicit a good review from me

12:46.400 --> 12:47.820
"despite me not using their services.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.540

very unprofessional."

12:49.600 --> 12:51.380
One star?! Bob backstabbed me!

12:51.440 --> 12:53.660
Who's that?
The owner of Western Animal Supplies.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.540
He must have wrote it
as soon as I walked out.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.100
Did you? Try and elicit
a good review from him?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.860
Well...well, only if he wanted to.
I gave them five stars.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.860
So? Reviews don't matter.
They do matter.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.860
As soon as you go on the webs...
Hey! Let it go.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.940
I gave YOU five stars. I...I just
think it's a bit mean, is all.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.620
Yeah, but you used our services.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.980
I haven't used yours.
I certainly won't be now.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.020
OK, well, maybe
I'll give you one star.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.260
Were you dissatisfied
with my service?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.340
Oh, no, um...

13:21.400 --> 13:22.860
What did I do wrong?
Oh, n-nothing.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.020
Daniel's under a lot of stress today

13:25.080 --> 13:27.140
because his friend George
is probably gonna die.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.220
Oh.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.700
It's a pig.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.700
Still very upsetting. Come on, Dan.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.900
OK. Clearly this is
very important to you.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.780
Maybe I could be
a teeny bit more professional.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.260
Would that help?
Thanks.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.340
It's not even that good a deal!

13:40.400 --> 13:41.820
It was my idea.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.380

Now, I'm not throwing anything out,
but doesn't that look better?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.580
It looks boring.
It looks professional.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.460
Now, how would you feel
about losing the cardigan?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.860

I'd buy a house from you.

You can wear my blazer.

Uh-uh.
OK, baby steps.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.580
Um, I was also hoping we could
change your email signature.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.180
What's wrong with
my email signature?

14:31.240 --> 14:33.580

Fine. Anything else?

14:44.960 --> 14:47.900
Yes. If I print something out,
please walk it over to me.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.260
Don't fold it into a paper plane
and throw it at me.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.180
It's a time-saver.
Neither of us have to get up.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.020
Yes, but most of the time,
it doesn't reach me.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.740
That's why I need the practice.
OK, just...

14:55.800 --> 14:57.820
Fine. No planes. Is that it?

to forgive us when we get back.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.700
Daniel...

18:26.200 --> 18:27.460
That was close.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.100
It's not your fault, George.
This is bullshit.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.020
They call themselves
a wildlife sanctuary?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.380
A pig isn't wildlife.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.740
Well, I didn't know that!
I mean, he's not a person!

18:37.800 --> 18:39.380
What about a farm?

18:39.440 --> 18:40.660
A farm might eat him too.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.300
No farm. Can he stay with you
and Grace until we figure this out?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.020
Yeah, I...I don't think
that's gonna work.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.340
We don't even have a fence.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.220
Well, the spare room, then.
Just until I find someone.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.580
I really don't want to keep
a stolen pig at my house.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.100
(PHONE CHIMES)
Oh.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.540
Oh, Brian left a review.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.900
"I like the house I bought,

18:56.960 --> 18:58.900
"but the woman seemed mad at me
for something.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.660
"I told a joke
and she just stared at me."

19:00.720 --> 19:02.060
What woman?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.660
"And the champagne wasn't cold."

19:03.720 --> 19:05.500
I just grabbed one off the bench.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.580
One star! Ugh!

19:07.640 --> 19:10.460
That's three stars now.
They're not cumulative!

19:10.520 --> 19:12.180
Maybe we ARE a one-star business.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.020
You know, we're supposed to be
at work right now,

19:14.080 --> 19:15.860
but instead, we've stolen a pig.

19:15.920 --> 19:20.500
I think we should take him to the
butcher and head back to the office.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.500
Nah.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.020
You don't have to do anything.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.740
I'm just gonna take him
to a secret location,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.580
which may or may not be
your old cubbyhouse,

19:31.640 --> 19:33.540
and secretly take care of him
forever.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.220
(POLICE SIREN BLEEPS)

19:35.280 --> 19:36.420
Was I speeding?

19:37.880 --> 19:39.180
I don't know.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.140
(GASPS) That pig wants bacon.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.940
No, Em...
No, it's not happening today.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.220
Emma...
We've come so far!

19:44.280 --> 19:45.580
No, no, no...
I just...I didn't see him.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.180
I can see him.
Doesn't matter if you can see him.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.860
This piggy is going home!
Emma...

19:59.880 --> 20:02.020
Emma. Daniel.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.660
Hi, Greg.
Hi, Greg.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.220
I had a phone call from Barbara
that you two had stolen Cathy's pig.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.500
Don't know what
you're talking about.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.380
We were gonna return him.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.020
After he died of old age.
Yeah.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.380
Look, I'm really sorry about this,

20:19.440 --> 20:22.580
but I'm gonna have to escort
you both to the butcher's now.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.300
Cuff me.
What?

20:24.360 --> 20:27.500
I will not drive this pig
to that butcher. Cuff me.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.420
(GROANS) Uh...

20:29.480 --> 20:32.300
Hang on. Wait a sec.
I think they're in the glove box.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.740
And a gun,
'cause you'll have to shoot me.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.500
Well, taser me.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.540
And put it on a low setting. Please.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.140
Em, we tried.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.020
Do you really think George
would want you to get tasered?

20:44.200 --> 20:46.220
That's a very complex thought
for a pig.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.340
They're very smart.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.980
We did everything we could.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.540
You can drive.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.860
I must have left them
at the station.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.780
We can pick them up on the way
if you like.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.420
Come on, George. Come on, buddy.
That's it. Come on.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.340
This isn't going on our record,
is it, Greg?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.780
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about that.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.540
Maybe it should.
No, it doesn't have to.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.900
Well, let's wait and see
what Cathy says.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.060
I would like it on record
that I tried to escape.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.340
George.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.020
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to write it up.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.420
No, too much paperwork.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.740
Actually, I quite enjoy
writing the reports.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.980
The other day,
I caught a man, mid-40s,

21:25.040 --> 21:26.980
throwing an apple core
onto the ground.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.180
You'd think that'd
barely manage a paragraph,

21:30.240 --> 21:32.220
but when you really dig into

21:32.280 --> 21:34.220
what must have been going
through his mind...

21:34.280 --> 21:35.860
I...I don't think George likes me.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.220
For starters,
he was quite near a bin,

21:38.280 --> 21:39.820
so we're not dealing with laziness.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.340
George, you're being unreasonable.
This man had made a choice.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.540
He said it was biodegradable

21:44.600 --> 21:46.780
and it was gonna end up
on the ground at the tip anyway.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.020
George...

21:48.080 --> 21:51.100
Which made me think that perhaps
the litter laws were more about...

21:51.160 --> 21:52.260
Come on, George.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.900
..aesthetics rather than
protecting the environment.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.180
Attaboy.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.460
Anyway, report ended up being five
pages by the time I sent it off.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.180
And someone reads that?
I'm not sure.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.020
Come on. Come on.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.820
Hello, Cathy.
Hi, Greg.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.180
Handcuffs?

22:10.240 --> 22:11.820
Her idea.

22:11.880 --> 22:16.140
I just need to say, this pig is
very smart and really nice to me

22:16.200 --> 22:18.020
and he doesn't deserve
to be hot dogs.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.620
And I know I'm a hypocrite,
but he's not just a pig.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.460
George is now a friend and...

22:22.520 --> 22:24.060
You mean Ned?

22:24.120 --> 22:26.300
What?
His name's Ned.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.620
Ned?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.900
Yeah, Ned.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.380
So he IS your pet?

22:30.440 --> 22:32.020
Yeah.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.540
Thought you'd go for a walk
to the real estate office, did you?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.180
Looking for your own place, mate?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.940
You're not gonna kill him?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.980
No, no. My niece met him
and fell in love.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.020
And if she ever comes round to visit
and Ned's not around, she loses it.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.540
And he's not bad company.
(GRUNTS)

22:47.600 --> 22:49.460
You want to press charges, Cathy?

22:49.520 --> 22:51.020
Want to press charges, Ned?

22:52.320 --> 22:53.900
Nuh. We're good.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.740
Should we get some sausages
to celebrate?

22:58.360 --> 23:00.020
It was obviously a joke.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.780
I'll see you back at the office.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.460
Do you think he misses us?
Probably.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.820
Me especially.
Pfft! Yeah, right.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.740
Salad for dinner?
Yeah.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.300
(PHONE CHIMES)

23:30.800 --> 23:32.260
We got another review.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.420
You know what? Don't care.
Not gonna look.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.620
Well done.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.660
Can you please look?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.620
We got five stars!

23:40.680 --> 23:41.780
No way. Really?

23:41.840 --> 23:44.660
"Thank you, McCallum Real Estate,
for taking such good care of Ned."

23:44.720 --> 23:46.500
And the internet doesn't know
Ned's a pig.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.900
It could be a property mogul.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.580
Go, team! Mrs Marsh?

23:49.640 --> 23:51.420
Mexican wave!

23:53.200 --> 23:55.980
Fine. Barbara! Coming your way!

24:00.760 --> 24:02.260
Whoo!

24:10.520 --> 24:12.460
Did somebody die in this house?

24:12.520 --> 24:13.660
Uh...

24:13.720 --> 24:15.820
You said "little old lady".
Maybe she was massive.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.260
A massive old lady?

24:17.320 --> 24:19.380
He loved the place and I didn't want
to ruin it for him.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.740
I mean, the fact
someone died in there

24:20.800 --> 24:23.380
doesn't change anything
about the property.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.140
(SOBS)

24:25.200 --> 24:26.660
This is too much. I want out.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.260
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.580
What's going on?
We're having a wake.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.540
Hey!
Nailed it!

24:37.600 --> 24:38.980
You have to sign it.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.340
It's all creased.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.900
Where's the other page? Wait...

24:44.680 --> 24:46.100
You also got a package.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.300
I'm kidding. Nah, I'm not!
