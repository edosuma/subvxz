01:28.824 --> 01:30.628
We are not an established gang yet!

01:35.496 --> 01:38.600
My friend, you should be very cautious.

01:38.601 --> 01:42.297
In my opinion,
we should try to make friends with all the gangs,

01:42.835 --> 01:44.498
The Japanese, the Chinese.

01:45.578 --> 01:51.861
Al Capone once said,
"There is enough money
to be made in this business for all of us." 

01:52.110 --> 01:53.829
It's all up to Fujiyama.

01:54.154 --> 01:57.644
He wants to make a certain treaty
with the Chinese gangs,
not the Japanese, 

01:57.678 --> 01:59.264
especially the Ginzas. 

01:59.962 --> 02:01.352
 Here comes the boss.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.172
What happened, Okamura-san?

02:15.250 --> 02:17.473
No. No deals, no friendships with anybody.

02:22.422 --> 02:26.188
- Right now, I want that old Chinese fox dead. 
- Okay, Boss.

02:27.588 --> 02:31.510
You heard the order?
I do not agree with the fighting.

02:33.166 --> 02:37.566
Okamura, it is not for us to decide.
It is up to the boss. 

02:39.094 --> 02:40.671
It's the order of Katana.

02:43.191 --> 02:44.608
We fight.

03:14.454 --> 03:16.854
Good morning, Mr. Li. 

03:19.923 --> 03:21.589
Have you decided to work with us?

03:27.631 --> 03:30.307
In no way we go under Fujiyama's flack.

03:32.339 --> 03:35.260
Mr. Fujiyama doesn't want to waste any more time. 

03:55.625 --> 03:57.817
- Come on, come on. Let's get going.
- Move it! 

03:58.909 --> 04:01.050
- You did it.
- The job is done. 

04:07.842 --> 04:10.545
I'm responsible for bringing you from San Diego, 

04:10.580 --> 04:13.248
are you sure this is a good bust? 

04:13.283 --> 04:14.228
Yeah, cocaine. 

04:18.928 --> 04:21.303
- Sergeant, how are you? 
- I'm just fine. 

04:21.851 --> 04:25.823
- We're going to go catch us some bad guys. 
- Good luck. Call me if you need me. 

04:25.858 --> 04:27.607
- See you.
- See you later.
- All right.

05:01.143 --> 05:04.689
- Who gave you the information? 
- A Chinese gang member. 

05:04.724 --> 05:07.690
His boss was killed by the Katana gang. 

05:09.085 --> 05:11.585
There's the blue van over there. 

05:11.586 --> 05:13.956
- So the van belongs to the Katana gang? 
- Yeah. 

05:15.230 --> 05:17.530
Let's call for the helicopter. 

05:19.520 --> 05:22.020
- Peggy, where are you? 
- I'm landing.

05:23.511 --> 05:27.235
No, no, no, don't land. We need you.
I'll give you the direction. 

06:07.798 --> 06:09.471
I can see the blue van. 

06:27.265 --> 06:32.635
- Peggy, Peggy, do you hear me? 
- Yeah, Frank. I can hear you. 

06:33.456 --> 06:34.758
Watch for the boat.

06:40.544 --> 06:44.319
There's lots of boats in the marina.
How am I supposed to know
which one is carrying the coke? 

06:44.620 --> 06:49.602
Just keep an eye on the van, Peggy. 
I'm well-informed there's a large suitcase
full of coke in the back. 

06:50.170 --> 06:52.007
They're going to make the swap somewhere in the marina.

06:52.324 --> 06:56.381
- Just stay close to them. 
- Okay, Joe. Keep it up. 

06:56.602 --> 06:59.168
Oh, it's up and ready, you just keep it warm.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.403
It's warm and ready. 

07:25.007 --> 07:27.121
Okay guys, I think we're getting close. 

07:27.122 --> 07:31.545
- There's a boat headed full speed towards the van. 
- Good, good. Just follow.

07:33.326 --> 07:37.116
- Try to stay out of sight, Peggy.
I don't want you scaring them off. 
- You got it, Joe. 

08:07.802 --> 08:10.298
- They'll come with the boat? 
- Yeah, yeah. 

08:13.346 --> 08:15.524
You stay here and wait.

08:24.532 --> 08:28.050
Hey Peggy, can you see them?
It seems like we've lost them.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.846
They'll have to come by this way,
it's the only road out. 

10:54.448 --> 10:56.748
Shoot! Shoot them!

11:03.250 --> 11:04.600
- Stop!
- Hold on.

11:05.814 --> 11:06.814
I got him! 

11:08.762 --> 11:10.262
Hey, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.400
Ow!

11:12.425 --> 11:15.825
Hey man, watch it.
Watch it.
Oh, man. 

11:20.530 --> 11:24.230
- Hey, let's call for backup.
- We'll call them when we need them.

11:34.269 --> 11:35.469
Shoot, shoot them! 

11:41.434 --> 11:43.934
Shoot, shoot them! 

11:48.100 --> 11:49.900
Shoot, shoot.

11:50.162 --> 11:52.662
- You got him.
- Yeah, I got the bastard.

12:06.781 --> 12:08.181
Let's go. Go! 

12:20.212 --> 12:23.342
Faster. Go, go, faster. 

13:20.422 --> 13:22.254
He's burning! He's burning! 

13:24.171 --> 13:26.575
He's on fire! He's on fire!
He's burning! Burning!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.750
Do something!
Man, he's burning!

13:29.917 --> 13:33.917
- We got to do something! 
- Man, you grab the blanket.
I'll get the fire extinguisher.

13:40.727 --> 13:42.427
Put the blanket on him. 

13:43.168 --> 13:45.668
That's it, that's it.
That's enough, he's out. 

13:52.846 --> 13:56.146
Good job guys. This calls for a celebration.

13:57.825 --> 14:01.125
You got it.
I'll see you back at your place. 

15:46.032 --> 15:48.032
The boss is coming.

16:07.873 --> 16:13.273
- So they call him samurai, huh? 
- Yes. His real name is Joe Marshall.

16:13.274 --> 16:19.274
He speaks fluent Japanese.
He got his martial arts training from the masters in Japan. 

16:20.687 --> 16:24.887
He was brought over here from the police force
in San Diego to fight us. 

16:25.088 --> 16:27.888
To fight us?
To fight me. 

16:28.189 --> 16:33.989
To destroy my operation.
To kill you and my other men.
To put handcuffs on me

16:33.990 --> 16:36.990
and put me in the gas chamber.

16:40.715 --> 16:45.515
Samurai, if he is a samurai,
what the hell are you? 

16:45.716 --> 16:49.316
I'll get to know him and then we'll see
who the real samurai is. 

16:49.317 --> 16:51.517
So you know where our man is? 

16:51.518 --> 16:54.518
Yes boss.
I know the hospital and the room. 

16:54.519 --> 17:00.519
And he's burned bad, real bad.
He won't be able to talk.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.720
I want him dead.
I want his head cut off and brought here. 

17:05.359 --> 17:07.060
I want his head on this piano,

17:07.060 --> 17:10.161
so that every man
in my organization understands once more

17:10.162 --> 17:14.762
that no Katana gets captured alive or talks.
Got that?! 

17:21.065 --> 17:24.464
I will bring you his head
and I will place it on your piano. 

17:24.465 --> 17:27.165
I know the real samurai is here.

17:31.837 --> 17:35.837
So, I'm lying there in bed with probably,
the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my life. 

17:35.838 --> 17:37.838
Hey, what are you talking about? 

17:37.839 --> 17:40.439
I'm just kidding.
You know you're number one. 

17:40.740 --> 17:43.040
- So anyway, this guy-
- I've heard enough of the stories.

17:43.041 --> 17:49.041
So anyway, you get on the phone and you tell me that this,
what's his name, Omaha, Yamaha, whatever his face
or his name is right, is after me? 

17:49.042 --> 17:53.642
So I figure, I'm going to have to knock a couple
of these guys off and I know I'm going to get the speech
from Captain Roma,

17:53.643 --> 17:57.143
"I've told you guys, I don't want anymore dead bodies."
Well, what am I gonna- 

17:57.744 --> 18:00.744
Frank, come to my office.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.379
- Hi Joe.
- Hi Aoki. 

18:13.408 --> 18:16.808
- In trouble again?
- What's it going to be today?

18:24.200 --> 18:27.000
- Hello sir.
- Joe.

18:27.068 --> 18:29.468
- Hey Steve, how are you doing?
- What's going on Steve?

18:29.969 --> 18:33.769
Not much sir.
There's a nurse and they're giving him an injection.
He's burned pretty bad. 

18:34.070 --> 18:35.770
Let's check it out.

18:48.105 --> 18:50.105
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:50.106 --> 18:53.606
How is he?
Do you think he'll be able to answer a few questions? 

18:53.607 --> 18:56.207
No way. His lips are burned.

18:56.208 --> 19:01.208
- So what? He'll never be able to talk again? 
- Oh, he'll talk again but you just have to
give him a couple of weeks. 

19:01.209 --> 19:05.209
- Next time guys, catch him in one piece.
- Thanks, nurse.

19:05.210 --> 19:09.710
- Do you like what you see?
- I love what I see.

19:10.469 --> 19:15.269
- Would you like to touch what you see?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

19:16.134 --> 19:20.834
- Would you like to go out with me?
- Uh-huh. Yes, I would.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.367
Would you like to fuck me?

19:29.363 --> 19:32.963
- Bingo.
- Well then let's see what you've got.

19:35.273 --> 19:39.273
- It doesn't interest me. Nothing there.
- Nothing there?

19:43.270 --> 19:47.670
Just exactly, what would interest you? 
Something the size of a jumbo jet?

19:50.024 --> 19:53.524
- Have you been circumcised? 
- Yeah, I have. Why?

19:53.525 --> 19:57.025
Well, your doctor must have cut a big portion of it off.

19:57.026 --> 20:01.826
- No. He was a good doctor.
- Good doctors make mistakes too.

20:01.827 --> 20:07.827
- That's why they buy insurance. 
- Hey, don't worry. I got enough. 

20:08.228 --> 20:11.228
- It's big. 
- I want bigger.

20:12.203 --> 20:13.803
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I have uh...

20:16.667 --> 20:19.467
- Have you been circumcised? 
- Shut up.

20:22.344 --> 20:25.344
Okay, Steve, I want you
to watch the room and watch it good. 

20:26.564 --> 20:28.964
You got three more officers coming to assist you. 

20:28.965 --> 20:32.245
And remember, no one goes in the room except for
doctors and nurses, got it? 

20:32.246 --> 20:33.946
- Okay, Joe.
- All right, let's go.

20:47.662 --> 20:49.962
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Frank. How are you doing? 

20:49.963 --> 20:54.263
Watch the room from all sides.
The burned man is very important to us. 

20:54.264 --> 20:55.264
Okay, sir.

21:04.529 --> 21:08.129
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- I have to change the trash, is that all right? 

21:10.175 --> 21:11.175
All right. 

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Oh, my God.

23:49.669 --> 23:50.669
Call security!

24:10.864 --> 24:12.264
I'm in corridor 2.

24:20.337 --> 24:22.637
Hey, wait a minute, nurse.
Wait a minute.

24:35.703 --> 24:37.003
Get up.

24:42.012 --> 24:43.412
Good job.

24:52.501 --> 24:55.901
No one's around.
Let's go. 

25:22.650 --> 25:25.150
Hey, wait a minute.
I want to talk to you. 

25:30.195 --> 25:31.495
Hey, wait a minute, stop.

25:38.945 --> 25:40.645
Come on, come on, let's get going.
Move it.

25:49.992 --> 25:53.192
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute, doctor.
I'd like to talk to you. 

25:53.273 --> 25:55.573
Can I see some ID?

26:21.390 --> 26:25.390
- Captain, what did I do wrong? 
- Everything you did was wrong.

26:25.903 --> 26:29.322
You're the one that talked me into bringing this moron
from San Diego

26:29.357 --> 26:31.969
to fight that Japanese Katana gang.

26:32.004 --> 26:35.904
You know what the results are?
A man in our custody lost his head,

26:35.905 --> 26:40.905
an officer lost his hand,
and there are three police officers
in the hospital right now. 

26:40.906 --> 26:43.812
God damn you guys.
All you've done is cause me

26:43.847 --> 26:45.727
bloodshed and mayhem.

26:45.762 --> 26:47.607
And me, misery in my future.

26:48.302 --> 26:52.302
This man has been here one week and I almost lost my job.

26:52.303 --> 26:54.603
If he's here one more week, I might well end up in jail

26:54.604 --> 26:56.762
and die of a heart attack and I don't like that.

26:57.005 --> 27:00.230
- SHey, I've been here one week.
- And just how long will it take you
to bring him to their knees?

27:00.388 --> 27:02.878
One week? One month?
Next year?

27:03.092 --> 27:05.085
At what cost and how many lives?

27:05.120 --> 27:09.407
With all due respect sir, now I can get these guys.
All I'm asking for is more time. 

27:09.408 --> 27:11.715
But I don't have the time and I don't have the patience.

27:12.399 --> 27:15.871
And I don't have much more credit in this department
to have bodies lying around me. 

27:15.906 --> 27:19.709
Fine. You don't want me here anymore?
All you got to do is ship me back to my place in San Diego.

27:20.110 --> 27:23.710
You bet your ass I will.
You're on your way to San Diego and I'll write the order. 

27:24.617 --> 27:26.817
Hey, Joe.
Wait, just wait.

27:28.736 --> 27:32.736
Look, captain, you know it, and they know it themselves.

27:32.737 --> 27:36.137
And what they want is results.
That's what we're going to give them.
We're going to give them the results. 

27:37.767 --> 27:42.744
Now, why don't we give Samurai here a second chance
because I need him, we need him, so why don't we just help him 

27:43.268 --> 27:47.362
and support him, all right?
Well, what do you say huh, cap?

27:48.109 --> 27:52.109
I feel like somebody stuck a big club up my ass and it hurts.

27:52.911 --> 27:56.411
I've got to figure out a way to get it out of there.

27:56.412 --> 28:00.212
God damn it, get the hell out of my office.
Get out of here!
I don't want to see your face. 

28:04.906 --> 28:05.835
Muah!

28:06.119 --> 28:09.519
You son of a bitch.
Come back here you motherfucker! 

28:25.926 --> 28:29.726
- What happened? You out or in? 
- Baby, I'm always in.

28:30.127 --> 28:35.527
Okay, Mr. Joe Samurai, now that you're in,
I've got some interesting news for you.

28:35.528 --> 28:37.128
What is it? 

28:37.429 --> 28:42.529
Well, it seems there's this restaurant,
Blue Lagoon on Third Street near Downtown.

28:42.530 --> 28:48.530
Well, Mr. Fujiyama, the head of the Katana gang,
this is where he's been hanging out.

28:48.531 --> 28:51.931
- What does Katana mean?
- It means Japanese sword.

28:53.304 --> 28:57.104
Also, there are two other Japanese gangs,
the Shinjuku and Ginza gangs.

28:57.105 --> 29:00.105
They're both rivals to the Katana.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.306
All right, both of those gangs are willing
to cooperate with us. 

29:03.307 --> 29:07.307
They're a small gang, mostly in gambling.

29:07.308 --> 29:11.308
They're afraid of Katana.
That's why they're willing to help us. 

29:13.194 --> 29:15.894
All right, in time,
we'll use their service but not now.

29:15.895 --> 29:19.895
Right now, I say you and I go pay a visit
to this Blue Lagoon Restaurant. 

29:23.199 --> 29:27.999
- You want to go? 
- I can't, but I'll be home later on.

29:29.688 --> 29:33.288
I may stop by, so keep it warm.

29:33.943 --> 29:36.143
Come on, Frank, let's go. 

29:44.321 --> 29:47.121
Jennifer, I have a small present for you.

29:47.667 --> 29:50.254
Thank you Mr. Fujiyama but I don't know
if I should accept that.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.368
Please, take it.

30:03.891 --> 30:06.391
Thank you. It's beautiful. 

30:09.598 --> 30:12.598
Hello, Mr. Fujiyama.
Hi, everybody. 

30:12.599 --> 30:15.199
- Hey, Tony. You're late.
- Oh, sorry.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.500
- Please have a seat.
- Thanks.

30:40.203 --> 30:44.703
- Are you Fuj... Fujiyama?
- Yes, I am. Who are you? 

30:45.042 --> 30:46.542
I'm a cop.

30:48.667 --> 30:53.067
In that case, you'll talk to me.
I am Mr. Fujiyama's attorney. 

30:53.068 --> 30:54.468
What do you want?

30:54.469 --> 30:58.169
So you're the infamous boss of this shit Katana gang, huh?

31:08.822 --> 31:10.222
Sit down.

31:16.067 --> 31:20.067
Look. Officer, you have no right insulting my client.

31:20.068 --> 31:23.068
- You have nothing on him.
- And yes we have.

31:23.069 --> 31:27.065
We have many things on him.
And this client of yours is going to need more than a lawyer

31:27.100 --> 31:28.724
to clean up his shit. 

31:28.759 --> 31:32.771
Officers,
if you have anything against me, then book me.

31:32.772 --> 31:35.972
Otherwise, as they say, "Get the hell out of my face."

31:36.473 --> 31:39.973
This is America, land of freedom and law.

31:41.709 --> 31:46.309
A man is innocent until he's proven guilty.
You have nothing on me. 

31:46.310 --> 31:48.610
Well, I got a lot of shit on you.

31:51.071 --> 31:56.071
I'll sue you and the department
for this insult to my client.

31:56.072 --> 31:58.872
I'll file a case first thing in the morning.

31:58.873 --> 32:02.873
Hey counselor, 
you still have three or four hours before the courthouse closes.

32:05.163 --> 32:10.163
Now, I'm telling these son of a bitches,
that we respect the Japanese of this country 

32:10.164 --> 32:14.664
who are honest businessmen.
And yeah, this is the land of opportunity 

32:14.665 --> 32:19.065
for legitimate business, not for death merchants

32:19.066 --> 32:23.066
who distribute drugs to our children
through schools and on the streets.

32:24.355 --> 32:29.355
Now, I'm telling these motherfuckers
that if they continue killing our children

32:29.356 --> 32:32.956
to make their precious millions that they deposit
in their secret Swiss bank accounts...

32:34.602 --> 32:38.202
Counselor,
before your lawsuit even gets off the court clerk's desk,

32:38.203 --> 32:41.603
I'll have their stinking bodies in garbage bags

32:41.604 --> 32:44.104
and ship them back to Japan for fertilizer,

32:44.105 --> 32:45.505
got it?

32:45.906 --> 32:47.506
And you, too.

32:51.580 --> 32:53.780
Excuse me, miss. 

32:54.181 --> 32:59.481
By the way, what's an all-American girl like you
doing with a geek like this? 

33:07.713 --> 33:09.313
See you around.

33:16.488 --> 33:19.188
Hey, counselor, we'll see you in court.

33:27.889 --> 33:33.689
- Who's that blond girl?
- Oh, her name is Jennifer.
She's the boss.

33:34.025 --> 33:38.725
- The boss? You mean she owns this place?
- Her mother owns the place.

33:38.726 --> 33:41.526
- Where is her father?
- Bang.

33:41.527 --> 33:44.527
- Killed? Who shot him?
- He.

33:44.608 --> 33:45.728
- Who?
- Him.

33:45.829 --> 33:47.729
- Who's him?
- Himself.

33:47.919 --> 33:50.919
- Oh, he committed suicide?
- Yes.

33:50.920 --> 33:58.320
Listen, when you see Jennifer alone,
tell her I think she is very lovely. 

33:59.061 --> 34:00.361
I'll do that. 

34:00.362 --> 34:04.962
- Tell her I'll try to see her soon. 
- Good. I'll help you.

34:05.183 --> 34:06.683
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:06.684 --> 34:09.984
I like cops.
My cousin's a cop.

34:10.806 --> 34:14.306
- Oh, really? Where?
- In Costa Rica.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.554
Oh, good.

34:16.936 --> 34:21.235
- What's your name? 
- Alfonso Rafael Federico Sebastián.

34:21.437 --> 34:26.437
- This is my first name. 
- Uh, what's your last name?

34:26.438 --> 34:29.938
- Oh.
- Oh, that's all right. We just need your first name.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

34:29.938 --> 34:33.539
Bye, bye.
I'll tell my cousin I know you. 

34:35.793 --> 34:37.532
Why didn't you let me hear his last name?

34:37.567 --> 34:41.329
Oh, come on, man.
His last name would have made a book.

34:41.364 --> 34:42.795
Hey, check it out.

35:12.683 --> 35:14.083
You're under arrest! 

36:02.789 --> 36:06.289
Idiots.
Get my men dead or alive.
Move!

36:13.096 --> 36:15.596
So what are you going to do,
fight this guy barehanded? 

36:27.716 --> 36:32.642
Freeze, you motherfuckers, leave him alone!
Uncuff him. I mean it, uncuff him!

36:43.195 --> 36:44.895
Damn.

36:51.298 --> 36:52.998
Frank, look out!

37:24.607 --> 37:26.207
Come on, get out of here! 

38:37.689 --> 38:43.189
- Son of a bitch. He killed his own men. 
- I know. It's called code of silence. 

38:43.190 --> 38:48.190
- He doesn't want anybody talking.
- God. And look what they've done to my car.

38:48.191 --> 38:52.991
- Captain Rome is going to burn my ass.
- Yeah, he's going to burn it charcoal black.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.692
- It is black. 
- Right on.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.838
Get the hell out of here. 

39:02.294 --> 39:04.994
Captain, what do you want me to do about the case? 

39:04.995 --> 39:07.795
- What case? 
- The Los Feliz case.

39:07.796 --> 39:11.796
You're the officer in charge of the case, go do it.
Bring me an arrest. 

39:13.775 --> 39:15.275
All right, captain. 

39:17.497 --> 39:24.497
- Mr. Fujiyama is very upset.
- Yes, counselor. I mean, he has every right to be,

39:25.670 --> 39:29.670
- but frankly, I don't give a damn.
- But Captain Roma, let me warn you.

39:29.671 --> 39:34.170
Fuck you and your client.
And you get your ass out of my office

39:34.205 --> 39:36.572
or you'll have to go to surgery
to get my foot out of it. 

39:36.573 --> 39:39.573
Get out of here, you asshole!
Leave me alone.

39:39.574 --> 39:42.574
I got more important things than a sheister like you.
Get out of here! 

39:42.775 --> 39:47.175
- I'll see you in court.
- You motherfucker, I'll see you in hell.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.476
Leave me alone.
Get a job! 

40:06.128 --> 40:08.628
Mr. Okamura, the police officer is here.

40:10.795 --> 40:11.795
Come on in.

40:19.310 --> 40:22.379
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.711
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by to see you.

40:25.755 --> 40:30.957
- Police questions?
- No, no, just friendly conversation.

40:31.225 --> 40:34.925
You know, rumor has it that, you own the restaurant.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.839
- It's a very nice restaurant.
- Thanks.

40:39.553 --> 40:43.427
You're a police officer,
questioning is the nature of your business, isn't it? 

40:43.462 --> 40:47.489
Yeah. But my visit today is simply social.

40:47.490 --> 40:52.329
- Why?
- Well, let's just say, I think you're very pretty.

40:52.330 --> 40:56.172
- Thank you.
- Geez, where are my manners,

40:56.173 --> 41:01.630
I haven't even introduced myself.
My name is Joe, Joe Marshall. 

41:01.631 --> 41:06.121
- I know. And they call you samurai?
- It seems you know a lot about me? 

41:06.937 --> 41:10.337
- They talk.
- Who's they, your Japanese friends?

41:10.338 --> 41:14.838
- They're not my friends.
- Well, if they're not your friends,
then how did you get to know them?

41:14.839 --> 41:17.677
I mean, do you know who they are, or where they came from? 

41:17.712 --> 41:22.708
Did you know that Fujiyama is the number one most wanted
criminal on the police list right now?

41:22.743 --> 41:25.495
Well, I don't know him well.
As far as I know, he's just a businessman.

41:25.569 --> 41:27.360
And he's been helpful to my mother and I.

41:28.299 --> 41:32.299
- How did you get to know him in the first place? 
- My father passed away.

41:32.300 --> 41:37.800
He owned this restaurant.
He left my mother and I buried under 400,000 dollars in debt. 

41:37.801 --> 41:43.801
So Mr. Fujiyama helped us out.
I guess, you could say, he owns the restaurant now. 

41:43.802 --> 41:46.302
That's why my mother and I feel indebted to him.

41:46.303 --> 41:49.303
You see, whatever he's done for you,
it doesn't mean anything.

41:49.304 --> 41:53.104
And the money that he spent on you
in this restaurant is drug money,

41:53.105 --> 41:54.405
dirty.

41:54.706 --> 41:58.406
You see, guys like Fujiyama make millions of dollars every year 

41:58.407 --> 42:00.707
in this town by selling drugs and destruction.

42:01.623 --> 42:04.623
And I don't know you too well, but...

42:04.624 --> 42:08.424
I think it's pretty safe to say that,
you shouldn't have any interest for what this guy is doing.

42:08.425 --> 42:12.125
Well, you're right.
I have no interest at all in their activities.

42:13.708 --> 42:17.363
Good. Well,

42:17.398 --> 42:20.220
I suppose being the restaurant owner,

42:20.255 --> 42:21.897
you must be here quite a bit?

42:21.932 --> 42:27.810
- Yeah, day and night, why? 
- How would you like to eat somewhere else for a change?

42:27.811 --> 42:32.411
- With me.
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm really busy. 

42:34.092 --> 42:37.592
Well, you're the boss.
Can't you get somebody else to do it?

42:37.893 --> 42:40.239
Not today.
My bookkeeper is coming by later. 

42:42.790 --> 42:45.255
Okay, how about tomorrow?

42:48.737 --> 42:52.237
Tomorrow is Friday and that's one of our busiest days.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.738
All right, Sunday. Sunday it is.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.300
Sunday, I go to church.
Besides, Sunday is my birthday.

42:59.601 --> 43:02.901
- Oh, Sunday is your birthday? Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

43:04.065 --> 43:07.365
- What church do you go to? 
- The Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.

43:07.866 --> 43:11.066
Ah, the Episcopal Church.
That's very nice.

43:13.342 --> 43:16.042
- Well, it was nice meeting you, Jennifer.
- You too.

43:16.735 --> 43:19.135
- See you later.
- Bye.

43:41.564 --> 43:44.464
- Don't move!
- What are you going to do, shoot me?

43:44.465 --> 43:48.665
Maybe a little later.
Right now, I got orders to break both your legs.

43:48.666 --> 43:50.366
Come on, let's go. Move.

43:58.002 --> 44:00.002
Stay back, this guy is mine.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Oh, my legs, my legs.

44:52.659 --> 44:54.859
- Tell me, who hired you?
- I don't know.

44:54.860 --> 44:58.860
- Tell me, who hired you to kill a cop?
- I swear, I don't know.

44:58.861 --> 45:02.161
Don't lie to me or I'll break your fucking wrist.
Now tell me!

45:02.162 --> 45:04.662
I can't, they'll kill me.

45:04.663 --> 45:07.663
No, they won't.
I'll help you. 

45:08.030 --> 45:12.430
Assaulting a police officer
with a deadly weapon will get you 15 years but if you tell me

45:12.431 --> 45:15.431
who hired you, I'll get them.

45:16.132 --> 45:19.132
- Okamura. Okamura sent me. 
- Which one is he?

45:22.292 --> 45:24.692
He's the big bald man.

45:30.554 --> 45:32.754
All right, I need his address.

45:32.755 --> 45:35.755
How do we know that this is the right house?

45:36.018 --> 45:40.718
If Okamura is here, then we'll arrest him.
Then we'll have a solid case against the Katana gang 

45:40.719 --> 45:43.719
for hiring four assassins to kill a policeman. 

45:43.720 --> 45:47.120
On the other hand, if it's the wrong house,
then we'll apologize to the owner, 

45:47.121 --> 45:48.121
the usual police routine.

45:48.611 --> 45:51.411
- Who's going to answer to Captain Roma on this?
- You.

45:52.088 --> 45:55.088
Shit, man.
He'll burn my ass. 

45:55.597 --> 45:58.797
You don't have to worry about that.
It's already-- 

45:58.798 --> 46:03.098
Yeah, yeah, I know it's already black, huh?
This time, he'd probably cut my dick too, huh?

46:03.099 --> 46:06.499
You better come to my house
before you report to the captain.

46:06.800 --> 46:10.100
- For what?
- Let's use it before you lose it.

46:11.821 --> 46:15.221
All right guys, listen up.
Peggy, you and Johnson go around the front.

46:15.222 --> 46:17.222
Frank and I are going to go around the back.

46:17.223 --> 46:19.923
If you hear shooting, come running.
Let's go. 

46:25.343 --> 46:29.943
- Hey, preacher?
- Yeah?
- You and I got nothing to do.

46:29.944 --> 46:33.744
- Let's fuck.
- Shut up.

46:46.571 --> 46:47.571
Damn.

46:50.439 --> 46:53.439
But you promised to buy me those Japanese pearls. 

46:53.740 --> 46:55.940
- Did I?
- Yes. You promised.

46:57.399 --> 47:00.149
- A favor is a favor.
- Okay.

47:00.184 --> 47:02.900
Can you satisfy me?

47:17.257 --> 47:19.357
- Hey, take a look behind the building.
- All right.

47:29.418 --> 47:30.418
Freeze!

47:47.123 --> 47:50.123
- Do you hear something?
- No. Is that him?

47:50.124 --> 47:54.124
I guess so.
Looks like this is his last fuck.

47:54.125 --> 47:57.525
- Let him finish it then.
- The hell I will.

48:03.170 --> 48:05.870
- Hey, look! 
- Police!
Don't move, you're under arrest!

48:07.554 --> 48:11.854
- Johnny, get your gun. Quick!
- Hurry! That way!
- Cops are here! Get them off my back.

48:13.695 --> 48:14.995
Freeze, Okamura!

48:23.475 --> 48:24.475
Freeze!

49:57.915 --> 50:02.315
I'm unarmed.
You're going to shoot me or fight me like a man? 

53:11.700 --> 53:15.500
He's under arrest.
Watch his arm, I might have broken it.

53:16.127 --> 53:17.527
Looks like you did.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.701
You're under arrest.
Come on, get up, get up! 

53:43.388 --> 53:45.388
Holy shit. 

53:46.603 --> 53:49.603
Well, this one is dead too.
Not captured alive. 

53:53.932 --> 53:58.532
We have some problems in the police department.
We have several new enemies.

53:59.623 --> 54:06.094
There's Captain Roma, Lieutenant Washington,
Andrew Johnson, Peggy Lee Thomas,

54:06.129 --> 54:09.724
and this kid they call the samurai cop,
Joe Marshall. 

54:11.109 --> 54:16.509
Most important, is Captain Roma.
We buy him, the others don't matter.

54:17.010 --> 54:23.707
No way boss, no way.
I tried to set them all up on private business.

54:23.708 --> 54:26.181
They would be financially-secured
for the rest of their lives.

54:26.535 --> 54:28.835
It's a downhill situation.

54:30.219 --> 54:33.172
I say, if we cannot buy them, we kill them.

54:34.190 --> 54:39.990
It is a most difficult situation.
If any of those guys are hurt,

54:39.991 --> 54:44.459
they would suspect us,
especially after Okamura's death.

54:53.353 --> 54:58.522
I have an idea.
Let's use an outside source.

54:59.566 --> 55:02.566
I'll call New York and we'll have them all wiped out.

55:06.786 --> 55:11.786
We cannot kill any of them now.
But we should punish them somehow.

55:13.784 --> 55:16.830
Call New York and get somebody to break both

55:16.831 --> 55:19.204
of those samurai cop's legs.

55:19.491 --> 55:23.549
- But don't you or your men get involved.
- It shall be done.

55:23.807 --> 55:26.807
Who could shoot this in a Mafia boss's house?

55:26.808 --> 55:28.808
One of his own men.

55:30.757 --> 55:35.457
Excuse me, where did the tall guy with the ponytail go? 

55:35.866 --> 55:39.566
- He is upstairs with my boss.
- Thank you.

55:50.129 --> 55:54.629
- Can I help you?
- Well, just a little business with him.

56:20.900 --> 56:23.900
- Are you expecting anybody?
- No.

56:23.901 --> 56:26.701
That's the warning bell.

56:27.202 --> 56:30.002
Oh, yeah?
Wait here.

57:07.421 --> 57:08.421
Freeze!

58:35.977 --> 58:38.393
Yeah, boss?

58:39.228 --> 58:40.810
Are they there?

58:40.845 --> 58:42.578
I'll be there right away.

58:44.282 --> 58:46.582
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to a party.

59:18.471 --> 59:21.671
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi. You're going to church too? 

59:21.672 --> 59:24.272
Yeah. I was in there preaching, didn't you see me? 

59:24.273 --> 59:27.573
- No, you weren't. Stop kidding me.
- Nah, I'm just kidding.

59:31.453 --> 59:35.453
Hey, hold on.
I have to ask you some more questions. 

59:35.454 --> 59:40.054
- Police questions?
- Well, let's just say some questions.

59:42.674 --> 59:46.174
- Okay, where?
- In my car. Come on.

01:00:00.372 --> 01:00:03.972
So this is the police station where you're interrogating me?

01:00:03.973 --> 01:00:06.673
- This is the place.
- Is this your house?

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:11.974
Yeah, I own it, month to month.
Come on, let me show you around.

01:00:18.017 --> 01:00:20.017
She left with the cop. 

01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:28.811
She left with the cop.

01:00:36.311 --> 01:00:40.011
- Kill him! 
- My pleasure.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.500
-Wow!
-Ain't that perfect!
-Boy!

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:58.890
- It seems like you went to a lot of trouble.
- You know what, as a matter of fact, I did.

01:00:58.891 --> 01:01:03.591
This chicken, I have a neighbor next door,
and she has farm animals.

01:01:04.338 --> 01:01:08.138
And what I did was I jumped the fence,
I stole one of her chickens and then killed it.

01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:10.939
- Great.
- I mean because I really wanted to impress you.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:16.140
- So I hope you're impressed.
- How did you know I'd come home with you?

01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:21.703
Let's just say, I can read eyes.

01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:48.931
- My God, oh my God!
- Come here, bitch.

01:01:48.932 --> 01:01:51.932
- What are you doing?
- Who the hell are you?

01:01:51.933 --> 01:01:56.133
- What the hell do you want?
- My husband, he's a police officer.
You can't do this to us.

01:01:56.134 --> 01:01:59.734
Yeah I know.
I want to know where your samurai friend is 

01:01:59.735 --> 01:02:04.535
- and I want to know now.
- I don't know. We're not good friends.

01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:13.192
John, John help me!
John do something.

01:02:14.115 --> 01:02:15.194
Leave her alone.

01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:22.841
Leave her alone, damn it!

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:27.054
Tell me where he is or I'll hack her throat
out piece by piece.

01:02:27.055 --> 01:02:30.755
- I swear, I don't know where he lives.
- Who knows?

01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:35.756
Well, please don't do anything foolish.
How about Frank or Peggy, the girl cop?

01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:40.073
- You lie.
- They're pretty good friends, maybe they know where he lives.

01:02:40.108 --> 01:02:44.390
Please don't hurt my wife.
Damn you!

01:02:44.391 --> 01:02:47.074
My God!
Oh my god!

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.206
This is Washington's address.
Chuck, you and your brother go there,

01:03:06.246 --> 01:03:08.861
we'll go to the policewoman's.

01:03:08.862 --> 01:03:11.964
He lives alone but sometimes,
his girlfriend is with him.

01:03:12.182 --> 01:03:15.563
- You know how I operate.
- We know boss.

01:03:15.564 --> 01:03:17.500
Good, good.

01:03:17.764 --> 01:03:20.364
- If you get the information,
you give it to me on the car phone.
- All right.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.640
- Let's go.
- Sally! Sally!

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.700
Sally! Oh my God.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.380
Surprise...

01:04:28.392 --> 01:04:32.392
- Who the hell are you? What do you want?
- I want information.

01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:36.571
What kind of information?
Want information about my butt?

01:04:36.615 --> 01:04:37.594
Sit down!

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:39.880
We'll shoot you.

01:04:41.439 --> 01:04:44.839
I'd love to put a bullet in your head.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
Oh, yeah.

01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:52.406
Hey, hey take it easy man, come on.
Talk to me, what do you want? 

01:04:52.407 --> 01:04:56.807
I could kill you now or I can relieve you of this gift.

01:04:57.208 --> 01:05:02.200
This black gift.
In a split second you won't enjoy yourself
for the rest of your life. 

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:09.109
- All I want is samurai's address. His address!
- It's over there in the closet.

01:05:10.518 --> 01:05:11.518
- Go get it.
- Yeah.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.166
Ain't nothing here.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.555
Ain't a damn thing in here.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.952
Cop,

01:05:33.953 --> 01:05:35.353
ain't nothing here at all.

01:05:39.496 --> 01:05:41.196
Leave him alone!

01:05:41.797 --> 01:05:43.297
Leave him alone I said!

01:05:43.498 --> 01:05:46.498
Drop it!
Or I'll cut his throat!

01:05:46.816 --> 01:05:47.816
I said leave him alone.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.600
Shoot him, shoot.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:53.016
Shoot him in the head.

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:53.800
Leave him alone!

01:05:53.999 --> 01:05:54.900
He's dead.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:07.050
You love cutting people, huh?
Now, you're going to get it. 

01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:22.102
Now that is real professional.

01:06:22.137 --> 01:06:23.381
- I thought so.
- No.

01:06:25.988 --> 01:06:27.388
Answer the phone.

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:34.800
Oh, God.

01:06:50.147 --> 01:06:52.447
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:08.118
Hey, baby.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:27.026
Get up! Hold her.

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:29.027
Get up! 

01:08:32.247 --> 01:08:33.247
Hold her.

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:45.667
This thing burns, you know.

01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:48.167
- Fuck you!
- Maybe some other time.

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:51.368
Right now, I want to know where your samurai friend is.

01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:53.370
I don't know.

01:08:56.207 --> 01:09:01.207
Maybe that will help you remember?
Now, you tell me where he his, I want his address now!

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:05.207
So foolish.

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:14.609
- No! No stop! You're burning me!
- Yes it burns and it's going to burn more.

01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:19.106
- Now, you tell me where he is. 
- No! No!

01:09:19.441 --> 01:09:25.392
He lives in Zuma Beach,
Number 35. 

01:09:28.938 --> 01:09:31.938
Thank you for you cooperation.

01:09:41.971 --> 01:09:47.372
Now, I'm going to burn that samurai lover of hers.
Cool down, young one.

01:09:56.529 --> 01:10:06.529
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear, Jennifer, happy birthday to you. 

01:10:07.351 --> 01:10:10.830
- You thought of everything.
- Well, you can't have a birthday without a cake.

01:10:11.131 --> 01:10:13.331
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:13:22.036 --> 01:13:23.236
Come on, Joe.

01:13:30.123 --> 01:13:34.423
- Hello.
- Listen, get out of your house.
I mean fast. Get out fast, man.

01:13:34.424 --> 01:13:36.624
Those guys are looking for you.

01:13:37.396 --> 01:13:39.396
Oh, yeah? What happened?

01:13:56.195 --> 01:13:58.995
Come on. Just get out fast.
I'll explain later, okay?

01:13:58.996 --> 01:13:59.996
They're coming after you.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.860
Looks like they're already here. Gotta go.

01:14:21.175 --> 01:14:22.175
Come on!

01:15:21.938 --> 01:15:24.138
Listen, don't worry.
Get back inside.

01:15:27.268 --> 01:15:30.468
You can run all you want,
but you'll never get away from me!

01:15:43.441 --> 01:15:44.441
Johnny, come on.

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.315
Hi, mom.

01:16:18.043 --> 01:16:20.774
Where the hell have you been?
I've been worried sick about you!

01:16:20.775 --> 01:16:24.239
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's easy for you to say.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.240
Mr. Fujiyama was very angry.
He made arrangements for you birthday.

01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.552
He got you presents.

01:16:29.553 --> 01:16:32.471
I don't care!
I don't want him to ever do anything for me again.

01:16:32.472 --> 01:16:35.641
What is the matter with you?
The man has been good to you.

01:16:35.643 --> 01:16:42.243
I don't give a damn!
And you know why? Because I'm in love.

01:16:50.479 --> 01:16:52.554
I should fire the both of you.

01:16:52.555 --> 01:16:56.434
You never brought me one of those bastards in alive,
so I can nail him with something.

01:16:57.709 --> 01:17:00.854
And because of you, I'm about to be fired.

01:17:00.855 --> 01:17:04.025
I'm going to lose my pension.
That means my future is gone.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:08.405
But you know something?
I don't give a fuck!

01:17:08.608 --> 01:17:14.240
There's only one thing in this world I want.
I want you to find
that mother-fucking Japanese gangster! 

01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:16.699
I want you to kill him, and I want you
to kill every one of his men. 

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:21.334
I want you to burn this house in bloodbath!
Don't leave anybody alive! 

01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:27.911
And when they're all dead, you come back to me
and all three of us will turn our badges in.

01:17:27.912 --> 01:17:32.212
So if I do it, we'll be off this police force for good.

01:17:34.157 --> 01:17:36.457
- Now you're talking. 
- All right.

01:17:37.306 --> 01:17:40.906
- See you, captain. 
- See you in hell.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:42.991
Let's go, Frank.

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:23.234
- Why did you come under? 
- 'Cause I'm an undercover cop.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.500
Come on.

01:18:59.087 --> 01:19:01.587
- They're here, boss.
- Where's the girl? 

01:19:01.588 --> 01:19:04.088
- She's down in the basement.
- The mother?

01:19:04.089 --> 01:19:07.089
- They kept her in the villa.  
- Use it. Finish him!

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:08.000
Okay, boss.

01:19:15.466 --> 01:19:17.666
- Go watch the other door!
- Okay, boss.

01:19:26.997 --> 01:19:28.397
We're behind you, get back!

01:19:49.564 --> 01:19:50.564
Drop it.

01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:48.291
All right Samurai, drop your gun
or your sweetheart will be dead.

01:21:50.248 --> 01:21:52.648
All I want to do is get out of this country.

01:21:56.618 --> 01:22:00.118
- I thought you were fond of her?
- Yes I was before you came in.

01:22:01.206 --> 01:22:04.806
Now that she loves you,
you'd have to worry about her life, not me.

01:22:05.107 --> 01:22:06.607
Neither do I.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.220
Drop it.

01:22:15.027 --> 01:22:18.027
- Drop it or I'll shoot you. 
- Take it easy, Frank. 

01:22:18.028 --> 01:22:21.428
Go ahead and shoot.
Her head will be blown off before I go down. 

01:22:22.577 --> 01:22:24.740
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on.

01:22:25.503 --> 01:22:28.680
How do I know if I drop my gun you won't shoot me? 

01:22:28.761 --> 01:22:31.478
Well, for one thing,
I don't want any more trouble with the police.

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:35.379
Bullshit.
The minute we disarm, he's going to shoot. 

01:22:47.598 --> 01:22:51.598
Drop the gun Frank.
I don't want Jennifer hurt.

01:22:52.099 --> 01:22:56.599
He's not stupid.
He doesn't want to do the killing himself. 

01:22:58.251 --> 01:23:00.451
Go ahead and drop it Frank.

01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:10.931
You American cops aren't as smart as I thought you were.

01:23:10.932 --> 01:23:13.932
Your cinnamon always gets in the way of your intelligence. 

01:23:26.198 --> 01:23:28.898
- It's your turn now cop. Say sayonara.
- No!

01:23:34.453 --> 01:23:36.653
- Frank, are you all right, man? 
- Yeah.

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:45.934
Well, he was smart in every way except one thing. 

01:23:45.969 --> 01:23:49.420
- What's that? 
- With all his money and success,

01:23:49.455 --> 01:23:51.577
he's not as smart as I am. 

01:23:52.765 --> 01:23:55.970
- To do what? 
- Put on a bulletproof vest, man. 

01:23:56.850 --> 01:24:00.850
- Let's go home. 
- I've got one more thing to take care of. 

01:24:00.991 --> 01:24:05.791
- What? 
- Yamashita. He's still alive.

01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:06.792
Oh, God.

01:24:21.509 --> 01:24:24.009
- Hey, come on. It's lunch time.
- Gonna be ready!

01:25:07.948 --> 01:25:11.548
- Look out, Joe.
- Don't worry.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.720
God damn it.

01:25:33.069 --> 01:25:36.369
Hey guys, the cops are here.
Come on, come on guys!

01:27:47.332 --> 01:27:48.332
Come on.

01:27:55.746 --> 01:27:59.146
- Yamashita is here. Watch out. 
- Let's split up. 

01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:58.396
Go get my sword.

01:28:58.397 --> 01:28:59.376
Hey Joe.

01:28:59.411 --> 01:29:01.689
So they call you Samurai? 

01:29:01.690 --> 01:29:05.681
Let's see how good you are with a sword,
samurai super cop.

01:29:13.739 --> 01:29:15.539
Come on, try me. 

01:32:31.428 --> 01:32:35.782
You lost.
You lost face.

01:32:42.626 --> 01:32:48.100
You know the code of the Bushita?
Kill me. 

01:33:08.995 --> 01:33:10.995
No Joe, you're a cop! 

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:29.244
What is he doing? 

01:33:29.578 --> 01:33:35.316
No. Leave him alone. He's a samurai. 

01:33:35.351 --> 01:33:38.249
He wants to die with honor.

01:33:39.305 --> 01:33:45.386
