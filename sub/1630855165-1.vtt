00:39.312 --> 00:40.673
[client]<i> I need money</i>
<i>and I need jobs.</i>

00:40.776 --> 00:42.412
<i>So is this-- Is this</i>
<i>a thing you can provide?</i>

00:42.514 --> 00:44.146
- [Lenny]<i> Yes.</i>
-<i> 'Cause you said you could.</i>

00:44.248 --> 00:45.680
<i>I-- I'd like to do one TV spot,</i>

00:45.782 --> 00:47.352
<i>- maybe, could you...</i>
- [Lenny]<i> Yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

00:47.454 --> 00:48.714
[client]<i> Could you get me</i>
<i>on one of the</i> Jimmys?

00:48.817 --> 00:50.521
- [Lenny]<i> Yes.</i>
- [client]<i> I need money...</i>

00:50.623 --> 00:51.691
- [Lenny]<i> Yeah.</i>
- [client]<i> ...and I need</i>
<i>opportunities.</i>

00:51.793 --> 00:52.960
<i>And I wanted to get--</i>

00:53.062 --> 00:54.191
<i>I want to get</i>
<i>into the comedy clubs,</i>

00:54.293 --> 00:55.557
<i>like, uh, the--</i>
<i>The Laughing Hut.</i>

00:55.659 --> 00:57.363
[Lenny]<i> Yes, I could</i>
<i>totally see you there.</i>

00:57.465 --> 00:59.025
[client]<i> And can you-- can you</i>
<i>get me into these places?</i>

00:59.127 --> 01:00.428
[Lenny]<i> Yeah, I can get you</i>
<i>into all those places, buddy.</i>

01:00.530 --> 01:02.035
-<i> Yes.</i>
- [client]<i> Yeah, like, I need--</i>

01:02.137 --> 01:03.633
<i>But I need that</i>
<i>to happen, like, now.</i>

01:03.735 --> 01:05.204
<i>I need something to happen</i>
<i>finally, you know what I mean?</i>

01:05.306 --> 01:07.104
- [Lenny]<i> Yes!</i>
- [client]<i> Okay, so let's go.</i>

01:07.206 --> 01:09.140
- Make it happen.
- Hey, I get it.

01:09.242 --> 01:12.309
Look, fame, fortune,
that's everything

01:12.411 --> 01:14.343
and don't let anybody
tell you otherwise,

01:14.445 --> 01:16.677
because without that,
you're nobody.

01:16.779 --> 01:20.684
But you can't do it alone.
It takes two to tango.

01:20.786 --> 01:23.988
Okay, I feel like
you're not listening to me
or hearing me at all.

01:24.091 --> 01:25.422
No, I hear you.
You're in a rut.

01:25.524 --> 01:27.456
You're not booking.
You wanna make some changes.

01:27.558 --> 01:30.296
So, we'll find a new agent,
new manager,

01:30.398 --> 01:32.132
and, you know, maybe
you could shake things up too.

01:32.234 --> 01:34.199
Like, work a dummy
into your act or something.

01:34.301 --> 01:36.167
I hear ventriloquism
is making a comeback.

01:36.269 --> 01:38.235
It's not. I don't know
who told you that.

01:38.337 --> 01:40.441
- People, and it is.
- No, it is not.

01:40.543 --> 01:41.469
Yes, it is.

01:41.571 --> 01:43.542
Find a puppet
that looks like you.

01:43.644 --> 01:44.777
[laughs]

01:44.879 --> 01:45.945
I can see it right now.

01:46.047 --> 01:48.012
- [laughs]
- That's not a thing.

01:48.115 --> 01:49.445
- It is a thing.
- No, it's not.

01:49.548 --> 01:50.915
- It's a great thing.
- What are you talk--

01:51.017 --> 01:52.081
What is this? What is this--

01:52.183 --> 01:53.314
this puppet suggestion?

01:53.416 --> 01:55.250
Look, it's been months, okay?

01:55.352 --> 01:56.416
And you've brought me nothing.

01:56.518 --> 01:58.188
Nobody. No agents,
no managers.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.157
You've introduced me
to zero people.

02:00.259 --> 02:02.061
Well, it takes time.
[chuckles]

02:02.163 --> 02:03.695
Yeah. I'm not sure
I even know what you do.

02:03.797 --> 02:05.265
What do you do?

02:05.367 --> 02:08.434
What do you mean "what"?
I do it all. I'm your guy.

02:08.536 --> 02:10.568
You said you're a publicist,
but you don't even
have a website.

02:10.670 --> 02:12.331
- There's no
phone number to call.
- No, I am. I am.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.667
Oh, excuse me, uh...

02:13.770 --> 02:16.504
- Are you a publicist?
- Yes. Eight dollars?

02:16.606 --> 02:18.212
- You are?
You're a real publicist?
- Yes.

02:18.314 --> 02:20.808
- You have other clients?
- Excuse me, I'm counting.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.612
One...

02:23.552 --> 02:24.311
Two...

02:24.413 --> 02:27.551
[distant siren blaring]

02:30.256 --> 02:31.450
- Three.
- I'm letting you go.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.584
- I'm moving on.
- What?

02:32.687 --> 02:35.527
- You're fired.
- What about us?

02:35.629 --> 02:37.256
- What about our relationship?
- "Us"? What does that mean?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.197
- What about the tip
that you promised?
- There is no us. The tip?

02:39.299 --> 02:41.263
There is no us.
You care about yourself.

02:41.365 --> 02:42.497
You don't care
about me at all.

02:42.599 --> 02:46.034
That is not true.
No, I think of both.

02:46.136 --> 02:47.373
I need you.

02:48.007 --> 02:49.375
I don't need you.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.507
Fine! Rip my heart out,
why don't you?

02:54.609 --> 02:55.908
No, I don't need you, anyway.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.977
I'll find somebody better.
Just you wait and see.

02:58.079 --> 03:00.681
- I'll find myself
a real somebody.
- [door closes]

03:00.784 --> 03:04.321
[doctor 1] The patient,
essentially, is nobody.

03:04.423 --> 03:07.756
- No family, no friends.
- [doctor 2] Hmm.

03:07.858 --> 03:11.793
His condition is quite frankly
bizarre, to say the least.

03:12.761 --> 03:15.496
He has the mind of a--
a five-year-old,

03:15.598 --> 03:19.773
or say, um,
a Labrador retriever.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.240
Understanding very little

03:21.342 --> 03:24.242
and allowing himself
to be quite easily led.

03:24.344 --> 03:27.875
Observe. Patient,
would you stand up?

03:28.576 --> 03:30.848
Stand up. Yeah, up, up.

03:30.950 --> 03:32.583
Yeah. Perfect.

03:32.685 --> 03:34.849
How about you, uh, maybe
put your hand on your head?

03:34.951 --> 03:37.350
Can you do that for me? Yeah,
put your hand on your head.

03:37.452 --> 03:39.026
On your head. Yep.

03:39.128 --> 03:41.755
Now your nose,
your finger on your nose.

03:41.858 --> 03:45.396
Yeah, yeah. Right.
How about your chin? Do that?

03:45.498 --> 03:47.664
How about for your--
Can you find your ear?

03:48.233 --> 03:50.738
Yeah. Great. Have a seat.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.606
You can have a seat now.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.368
Have a seat.

03:54.470 --> 03:56.573
No, no. Sit. You're done.

03:56.675 --> 03:58.904
Here you go, just sit down.
Yeah, you're good.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.311
You're good. We're done.
No, no, you did great.

04:01.413 --> 04:04.683
You did wonderfully.
Good job.

04:05.353 --> 04:07.821
- See? It's...
- What do you think it is?

04:07.923 --> 04:09.418
Age regression, perhaps?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.652
We do think
it is that, in part,

04:11.754 --> 04:14.391
possibly caused
by some severe trauma,

04:14.493 --> 04:16.394
the loss of a loved one.
It's hard to say.

04:16.496 --> 04:18.596
The patient has lost
the ability to speak.

04:18.698 --> 04:21.198
- [doctor 2] Oh, I see.
- [doctor 1] He's not deaf

04:21.300 --> 04:23.234
and he's technically not mute.

04:23.336 --> 04:25.171
His case is medically
undefinable.

04:25.273 --> 04:26.566
[doctor 2]
Is his condition reversible?

04:26.668 --> 04:28.040
[clicks tongue] Mm, you know,

04:28.142 --> 04:29.373
with a proper amount of care

04:29.475 --> 04:32.112
and, uh, a lot
of exposure therapy

04:32.214 --> 04:34.809
and neurophysical
cognitive therapy,

04:34.911 --> 04:39.180
and if he were to have
one meaningful connection,

04:39.282 --> 04:43.223
yes, it's possible
that he could regain
his understanding of the world,

04:43.325 --> 04:46.552
his ability to speak,
his-- his emotions.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.162
- Fascinating.
- Hmm.

04:49.264 --> 04:51.363
So, what's our first course
of action?

04:51.466 --> 04:53.664
Well, the state is not gonna pay
for any of that,

04:53.766 --> 04:57.932
so we are gonna put his ass
on the first bus downtown.

05:02.077 --> 05:04.037
[bright upbeat music playing]

05:18.455 --> 05:20.427
Hey, Don, it's Lenny!

05:21.694 --> 05:24.691
You don't even know
why I'm calling you, buddy.

05:25.227 --> 05:28.730
Okay, that, yeah, that is why
I'm calling you. But listen.

05:28.832 --> 05:31.001
No, I'm just talking
about representation.

05:31.103 --> 05:32.599
Hello? Oh, man.

05:32.701 --> 05:35.470
Geez, Louise. Geez, Louise!

05:35.572 --> 05:37.807
[both struggling, grunting]

05:42.313 --> 05:44.246
[train whooshing]

05:44.348 --> 05:46.612
[train horn blaring]

05:46.714 --> 05:48.548
Mikey. Mikey, please.

05:48.650 --> 05:51.056
I just-- I'm begging you.

05:51.158 --> 05:54.126
I just-- I need a client.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.523
No, you're getting personal.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.597
I am a real publicist, Mikey.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.294
No, I get people things.

05:59.396 --> 06:01.633
[children laughing]

06:04.137 --> 06:07.773
[whistle blowing]

06:07.876 --> 06:09.042
[laughing]

06:09.144 --> 06:11.709
[bright upbeat music continues]

06:14.014 --> 06:16.010
[cheering]

06:17.217 --> 06:19.585
What? Are you kidding?

06:21.890 --> 06:22.984
[groans] No!

06:23.892 --> 06:25.454
God! Ugh!

06:25.556 --> 06:27.791
[bright upbeat music continues]

06:31.966 --> 06:34.534
Hi, Armando.

06:35.335 --> 06:37.771
Yeah. How you doin', buddy?

06:37.873 --> 06:39.803
Oh. Oh, shoot.

06:40.736 --> 06:42.509
Hold on, let me call you back.

06:44.408 --> 06:45.809
[Lenny grumbling]

06:50.513 --> 06:52.816
[people chattering]

07:05.561 --> 07:07.765
[soft music playing]

07:16.907 --> 07:19.639
Hey, it's Lenny
from Starmaker Publicity.

07:20.275 --> 07:23.109
I'm sorry, I just don't see
your name on the list.

07:23.211 --> 07:25.413
Um, which film production
are you with again?

07:25.515 --> 07:26.782
I'm with the, um...

07:26.885 --> 07:28.850
Um, you know me,
I'm a big-time publicist, so...

07:28.952 --> 07:30.589
- You said that.
- I mean, well, you know,

07:30.691 --> 07:33.591
I'm not some bozo
that, um, you know, just...

07:33.693 --> 07:37.660
I-- I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I don't, um...

07:37.762 --> 07:40.063
Okay, look.
I can give you some money.

07:40.165 --> 07:43.032
I mean, just a little bit.
I mean, not now,
but down the line.

07:43.134 --> 07:46.768
Look, I find the right client,
I cut you in on the profits.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.970
Bing, bang, boom.
We're somebodies.

07:49.072 --> 07:50.871
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

07:50.973 --> 07:52.675
Okay, well, wait,
wait, wait. Okay.

07:52.777 --> 07:54.642
I'll give you
five dollars. Please.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.649
Just let me on the lot, please.

07:56.751 --> 07:58.849
Please let me on the lot.
Please let me on the lot.

07:58.951 --> 08:01.522
Please let me on the lot.
Please let me on the lot.

08:02.387 --> 08:03.689
[car engine starts]

08:04.752 --> 08:06.387
[tires screeching]

08:06.489 --> 08:08.896
[producer] What?
What do you mean he won't
get outta the trailer?

08:08.998 --> 08:10.862
[assistant on phone]
<i>I don't know, he said</i>
<i>he lost the character.</i>

08:10.964 --> 08:15.530
Ugh, you know what? I've had it
with his method acting bullshit.

08:15.632 --> 08:17.299
It's just all nonsense.

08:17.401 --> 08:21.404
All he's gotta do
is go hit the mark,
say his words and that's it.

08:21.506 --> 08:22.773
Spencer Tracy said that.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.942
Good enough for him,
that's good enough for me.

08:25.044 --> 08:26.908
- Put him on the phone.
- [assistant]<i> I tried already.</i>

08:27.010 --> 08:28.747
<i>He said phones</i>
<i>weren't invented yet.</i>

08:28.849 --> 08:31.617
Trailers with air conditioning
weren't invented yet either,

08:31.719 --> 08:34.550
but he doesn't mind sitting
in one of those all day.

08:35.153 --> 08:36.954
- Fuck off.
<i>- Well, production's</i>
<i>at a standstill.</i>

08:37.056 --> 08:39.057
- Fuck off!
-<i> They need you</i>
<i>to think of something.</i>

08:39.159 --> 08:40.561
<i>Please. Now.</i>

08:44.296 --> 08:45.632
Holy shit.

08:47.128 --> 08:49.702
- [cars honking]
- [tires screeching]

08:51.132 --> 08:53.640
- [tires screeching]
- [cars honking]

08:56.273 --> 08:57.303
Oh.

08:59.343 --> 09:00.374
Get in.

09:01.043 --> 09:02.579
Come here. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Get in.

09:02.681 --> 09:04.547
Get in. You--
you speak English?

09:04.649 --> 09:06.483
Come here, I got a job for you.

09:06.585 --> 09:08.050
Come on, this is gonna be good.

09:08.152 --> 09:10.183
Come on, I promise you.
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

09:10.285 --> 09:12.289
Oh, you should have
brought some. That's okay.

09:12.391 --> 09:15.292
[producer laughs]

09:15.394 --> 09:17.631
[tires screeching]

09:18.726 --> 09:20.128
[car honks]

09:21.697 --> 09:23.901
[soft music playing]

09:27.636 --> 09:28.906
[car honking]

09:51.297 --> 09:52.661
Latte. Pronto.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.192
- [tires screech]
- Got it.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.637
Get Booker a latte
as fast as possible.

10:00.470 --> 10:01.539
Updates?

10:01.641 --> 10:03.308
Mr. Bingsley's still
in his trailer.

10:03.410 --> 10:04.708
- Sir.
- Excuse me?

10:04.810 --> 10:06.678
Remember to call him
Sir Bingsley.

10:06.781 --> 10:08.712
I don't want another episode
like last time.

10:08.814 --> 10:10.648
Sorry, Sir Bingsley's
still in there.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.081
We've been shooting
second unit stuff,

10:12.183 --> 10:13.912
but the rest of the cast
is getting a little irritated.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.622
Nobody's-- nobody's walked.

10:15.724 --> 10:17.150
Chad Luxt went for a drive
to blow off some steam,

10:17.252 --> 10:18.886
- but he said he'd be back.
- Is he sober?

10:18.988 --> 10:20.419
- For now.
- All right. Christiana?

10:20.521 --> 10:22.791
She's fine. She's Skyping
with the government of Uganda

10:22.893 --> 10:25.028
about a charity visit
or something.

10:27.230 --> 10:29.696
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

10:29.798 --> 10:31.430
So, what's the plan?

10:32.303 --> 10:33.267
Him.

10:36.338 --> 10:39.405
- [TV playing indistinctly]
- [Bingsley laughs]

10:41.545 --> 10:45.378
[laughing]

10:47.652 --> 10:50.952
[Bingsley spits, laughs]

10:51.054 --> 10:52.792
- Look at that!
- [knock on door]

10:52.894 --> 10:55.825
- Sir Bingsley. May I come in?
- [laughing continues]

10:56.294 --> 10:58.961
[Bingsley] What the hell kind
of highfalutin name is that?

10:59.063 --> 11:02.433
I answer to one name
and one name only...

11:02.535 --> 11:04.001
and that's Billy the Kid.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.208
Uh-huh. All right,
Billy the Kid.

11:08.310 --> 11:10.009
Okay, what-- Hang on,

11:10.511 --> 11:11.906
don't drop the "Sir" part now.

11:12.008 --> 11:14.173
- Excuse me?
- Sir Billy the Kid.

11:14.275 --> 11:15.779
I think that gonna
suit me just fine.

11:15.881 --> 11:17.784
Got kind of a nice ring
to it, don't it?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.612
How about you call me that
from now on, all right?

11:19.714 --> 11:22.115
Yeah, make an announcement
to whoever all
is out there, right?

11:22.217 --> 11:25.258
It's Sir Billy the Kid
from now on.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.758
Listen to me, fuckface.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.158
You're either a Sir
and an actor from England,

11:29.260 --> 11:32.396
or you're Billy the fucking Kid,
but you can't be both.

11:32.498 --> 11:33.699
[speaking gibberish]

11:33.801 --> 11:35.964
No, I'm done. I'm done.
I'm sick of this shit.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.298
- I'm sick of it.
- [laughs, spits]

11:38.400 --> 11:40.867
Yappin' your fuckin' mouth,
you ain't worth shit.

11:40.969 --> 11:42.237
Take a look at this guy.

11:45.312 --> 11:46.279
What about him?

11:46.381 --> 11:47.943
He's a dead ringer for you.

11:48.045 --> 11:49.274
This man don't look
nothin' like me.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.747
I mean, look at him.
He's too short.

11:50.849 --> 11:52.145
He's the exact
same height as you.

11:52.247 --> 11:53.817
He's just not wearing
lifts like you do!

11:53.919 --> 11:55.149
Hey, now you listen
to me, all right?

11:55.251 --> 11:56.985
I never worn a lift
in my goddamn life.

11:57.087 --> 11:58.757
You know what? I'm done.
I'm fuckin' done.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.222
I probably don't even know
what a lift is

12:00.324 --> 12:01.627
- 'cause they haven't
been invented yet.
- Stop.

12:01.729 --> 12:04.059
- Stop the shit.
- Stop and cut the shit.

12:04.161 --> 12:05.662
Don't think I'm not gonna
take him into makeup

12:05.765 --> 12:07.265
so he can finish
the day for you.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.936
Ooh! [laughing]

12:10.038 --> 12:10.766
Yeah?

12:10.868 --> 12:13.436
Now we rollin',
big boss-man.

12:13.538 --> 12:14.802
Now we rollin'.

12:14.904 --> 12:16.035
And guess what, fuckface?

12:16.137 --> 12:18.042
I'd like to see you try that.

12:18.973 --> 12:20.847
Let's go. Let's go!

12:21.981 --> 12:23.444
Okay, let's see what
we're working with here.

12:23.546 --> 12:25.577
- Oh, my God,
it's a spitting image.
- Oh, my God...

12:25.679 --> 12:28.149
- You look exactly like him.
- I don't see it at all.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.316
- How are gonna do this?
- All you have to do

12:30.419 --> 12:31.789
- is just put some color on.
- [overlapping]

12:31.891 --> 12:33.222
You're actually
way more attractive.

12:33.324 --> 12:34.794
I would agree with that,
actually. The bone structure.

12:34.896 --> 12:36.488
But I don't see it at all,
I don't see it all.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.390
- You are always so negative.
- You're crazy.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.195
Would you help instead
of hurting things?

12:40.297 --> 12:42.429
- I just-- Over here.
- Is this your first time?

12:42.531 --> 12:44.804
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, let's sit back down.

12:44.906 --> 12:46.501
Let's sit back down.
You're stressing him out.

12:46.604 --> 12:48.667
- Why are you moving your face?
- Look at you,
how gorgeous you are.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.206
[producer] All right, so this is
the sound stage. Real dirt.

12:51.308 --> 12:54.511
That's the bank over there,
that's the saloon.

12:54.613 --> 12:57.210
So... Tony. Tony.

12:57.312 --> 12:59.449
This is Tony London,
the director.

12:59.551 --> 13:01.151
This is the guy.

13:04.722 --> 13:06.222
[indistinct chatter]

13:07.789 --> 13:08.789
Fine.

13:08.891 --> 13:10.329
Chad, Chad. Chad.

13:10.431 --> 13:11.423
This is Chad Luxt.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.966
Okay, he plays Black Bart,
the other lead.

13:17.366 --> 13:20.005
I understand you're
from the streets, hmm?

13:21.742 --> 13:23.937
Mad respect, bro.
Mad respect.

13:24.039 --> 13:26.675
Word. All right.
[chuckles]

13:26.777 --> 13:28.208
He's a character.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.983
Uh, and this is the great
Christiana Dior.

13:31.085 --> 13:34.116
I'm sure you know who she is.
She's playing your wife,

13:34.218 --> 13:36.384
the one that you're leaving
for Bart's girl.

13:38.858 --> 13:41.455
Nice meetin' you.
Oh, right. Uh...

13:41.557 --> 13:44.157
See, you ain't accustomed
to seeing me like this.

13:44.259 --> 13:46.295
I'm fixin' to stay
in character.

13:47.268 --> 13:48.332
[spits]

13:49.101 --> 13:50.768
- Too short, ain't he?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.873
I'm gonna put him
on an apple box.

13:54.671 --> 13:55.972
[spits]

13:56.074 --> 13:58.538
All right, as for you--
Hey, hey, hey.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.374
As for you, Bart knows
you're sleeping with his girl.

14:02.476 --> 14:05.080
Your wife is ready
to blow her brains out,

14:05.182 --> 14:08.520
so what I need from you
is give me a--

14:08.622 --> 14:10.856
"This is such a mess."

14:10.959 --> 14:13.421
That kind of look, that--
that kind of feel.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.457
You got it? Yes or no?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.934
Jesus Christ,
can you even talk?

14:22.197 --> 14:24.069
You don't know
if you can talk?

14:24.171 --> 14:27.339
- [Chad] Let's go, it's hot.
- All right, just fuck it.

14:27.441 --> 14:28.501
Do nothing.

14:28.603 --> 14:30.240
- [Chad grunting]
- Works for tons of actors.

14:32.376 --> 14:35.641
- Take it, Tony.
- [Chad continues grunting]

14:37.882 --> 14:39.849
[upbeat music playing]

14:39.952 --> 14:41.886
[huffs air] Fly.
Fly like a bird.

14:41.988 --> 14:43.517
- [exhales]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:44.624 --> 14:46.259
Ready? Say a prayer.

14:46.361 --> 14:47.689
[Tony chuckles]

14:47.791 --> 14:49.259
Right here, sir.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.761
Nope, nope, nope.
Right here. Just hold still.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.031
[Chad grunting]

14:55.133 --> 14:57.003
Right, I need you here.
I need you here.

14:58.001 --> 14:59.338
The guy won't stop moving.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.439
No, it's fine.

15:01.975 --> 15:03.939
[production assistant
sighs, grunts]

15:04.041 --> 15:05.374
Up on the box, please, sir.

15:06.075 --> 15:07.710
Stay, no, right there.

15:08.179 --> 15:09.381
- On the box.
- On the box, buddy?

15:09.483 --> 15:10.242
Got him? Fine.

15:10.345 --> 15:11.713
- On the box.
- On the box.

15:11.815 --> 15:12.847
Right there.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.847
All right, just be yourself now.
Be yourself. Come on.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.856
Just connect your emotions with
the suffering of the streets.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.292
[breathes deeply]
Feel me? Hmm?

15:21.394 --> 15:23.993
I'm gonna come at you hard, bro.
I'm gonna come at you real hard.

15:24.095 --> 15:26.594
Stay on the box.
Right here. Good.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.400
Come on, let's spin 'em.

15:28.502 --> 15:31.397
32-A, take one.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.471
- [Chad grunts]
- [Tony] All right.

15:33.573 --> 15:36.067
And... action.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.874
You think you can mess
with my girl, Billy?

15:39.976 --> 15:41.110
You get him, Bart.

15:41.212 --> 15:43.178
He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.816
You think you're fast,
but I'm faster.

15:45.918 --> 15:48.885
You wanna get to know my blade?

15:48.987 --> 15:50.717
You wanna get to know my blade?

15:50.819 --> 15:53.323
- He's looking right
into camera.
- Just keep rolling.

15:53.425 --> 15:56.794
You wanna-- You wanna
get to know my blade? You wanna?

15:56.896 --> 15:58.661
Do you want-- What is the line?

15:58.763 --> 16:01.695
- "And you will know the other."
- [spits] I don't need
the line reading.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.231
- Also, it's a stupid line.
- Just say the goddamn line,

16:04.333 --> 16:05.665
- will ya?
- It's a terrible line.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.302
The line is terrible, okay?
I don't wanna say it.

16:07.405 --> 16:09.372
I'll say it for you
if you can't figure out how.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.277
- No, I know how to say it.
- Talkin' about your gun.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.640
- No, I know what... [mumbling]
- In case you didn't
read the script.

16:13.742 --> 16:15.944
- Maybe you should go home...
- [Tony] Try not looking

16:16.046 --> 16:17.914
at the camera on this one?

16:18.016 --> 16:19.412
- Yeah, you.
- Terrible line.

16:19.514 --> 16:21.486
- Come over here. Step...
- Marker.

16:21.588 --> 16:23.619
And, action.

16:23.722 --> 16:26.692
- [Chad] You think
you can mess...
- [Tony] Right into camera.

16:26.794 --> 16:28.226
It's his first time doing this.

16:28.328 --> 16:30.124
[Christiana] He's a cheatin'
sack of shit as it is.

16:30.226 --> 16:32.426
Over there. Over there. There.

16:32.528 --> 16:34.359
All right. Can we--
Can I just go back?

16:34.461 --> 16:35.932
[Tony] Put him back on the box.

16:36.035 --> 16:38.602
- Take three.
- And, action.

16:38.704 --> 16:40.804
[Chad grunting]

16:40.906 --> 16:42.372
- There we go.
- Four.

16:42.474 --> 16:44.068
- [Tony] Action!
- I'm feelin' good now.
Feelin' good.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.906
- Can I just go back?
- [Tony] Yes. Uh, take it
from the top.

16:47.008 --> 16:48.178
Take five.

16:48.280 --> 16:51.243
You gonna step in line
and get the blade,

16:51.345 --> 16:53.383
or you gonna get the...

16:53.485 --> 16:56.355
- What-- what is the line?
- Just the word "other"!

16:56.457 --> 16:57.952
[sighs]

16:58.054 --> 16:59.184
[Chad] The other.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.693
- Oh.
- Twenty.

17:00.795 --> 17:01.992
- [Tony] Action.
- You think

17:02.094 --> 17:03.958
you can mess
with my girl, Billy?

17:04.060 --> 17:05.495
You get him, Bart.

17:05.597 --> 17:07.792
- [Chad] Hmm?
- He's a lyin' sack
of shit as it is.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.932
- Cut his tiny little balls off.
- Oh, shut up, you.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.302
Hey, don't improv.

17:12.404 --> 17:14.438
- You don't improv.
- How many fucking times?

17:14.540 --> 17:17.170
We're over lunch by an hour.
All these extras
are in pain and...

17:17.272 --> 17:19.210
[Tony] Rolling. Action.

17:19.312 --> 17:23.815
Now, you should step in line
and get the blade...

17:23.917 --> 17:26.317
[tense quirky music playing]

17:32.058 --> 17:34.622
- The other.
- I hate you, Billy!

17:36.225 --> 17:38.959
- [yells]
- Bang, and cut!

17:39.061 --> 17:40.760
[buzzer blaring]

17:42.033 --> 17:43.128
[Chad] Hey, hey, hey.

17:43.998 --> 17:46.131
- You gotta breathe.
- [Tony] We're going
to go again.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.734
Latte, pronto.

17:49.478 --> 17:50.510
Good work.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.812
Excuse me, Mr. Pronto.
I'm a publicist for the, um...

17:54.914 --> 17:56.346
Can I call you Latte?

17:56.448 --> 17:58.610
- Is that your name?
- Oh, my God, I love that name.

17:58.712 --> 18:00.352
- Amazing. You are.
- I had no idea!

18:00.454 --> 18:02.848
A lot of big stars are going
by inanimate objects these days.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.892
Stepping in. Uh, we're
at lunch, folks. That's lunch.

18:05.994 --> 18:07.323
- Oh, thank you. Yeah, yeah.
- Aww.

18:07.426 --> 18:09.455
I'm gonna take Latte Pronto
if you need us.

18:09.557 --> 18:11.524
- [chuckles]
- I'm sorry. Who?

18:11.626 --> 18:13.999
Oh, oh, no, it's,
uh, Latte Pronto.

18:14.101 --> 18:15.795
He's the star of--
Yeah. Latte Pronto.

18:15.897 --> 18:18.099
- Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Pronto.
- Oh. [stammers]

18:18.201 --> 18:19.201
I will write that down.

18:19.303 --> 18:20.501
- Oh, that's okay.
- It's okay.

18:20.603 --> 18:21.975
You're doing great,
you're doing awesome.

18:22.077 --> 18:23.840
- So sweet.
- No, you guys are so sweet.

18:23.942 --> 18:26.477
Are you kidding me?
You've just been so great
in expediting everything.

18:26.579 --> 18:28.573
- Thank you. Okay,
I'm so sorry again.
- Oh, it's okay.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.082
All right, see you
guys at lunch.

18:30.184 --> 18:31.280
- We'll be on the lot.
- See you at lunch.

18:31.382 --> 18:32.477
- Absolutely, thank you.
- See you there.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.778
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.419
- She's disgusting.
- She is the absolute

18:35.521 --> 18:36.648
- worst person on this Earth.
- I can't stand her.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.186
Are you kidding me?
"It's time for lunch."

18:38.288 --> 18:40.524
[Lenny laughing] Right here.

18:40.626 --> 18:41.823
Hmm.

18:41.925 --> 18:44.857
Mm...

18:45.898 --> 18:47.926
Wow. Latte Pronto.

18:48.028 --> 18:50.763
You and me are gonna do
big things, pal, I can feel it.

18:50.865 --> 18:52.667
Look, that guy's the head
of the studio over there.

18:52.769 --> 18:55.140
All his teeth are fake,
by the way. I'll say hi later.

18:55.242 --> 18:57.108
Oh, see her? The one
who looks like a model?

18:57.210 --> 18:59.443
Don't look. She's actually
a prostitute.

18:59.545 --> 19:02.245
- Hi.
- Hi. Let's do two
of the salmon salads--

19:02.347 --> 19:03.777
Hold the salmon
'cause of the mercury.

19:03.879 --> 19:06.385
No cheese or fatty nuts
of any kind on there, please.

19:06.487 --> 19:09.248
Oh, balsamic on the side--
Actually, scratch that.
No dressing,

19:09.350 --> 19:12.018
just the lettuce rinsed
thoroughly with Evian water,
we're gonna split that.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.453
Oh, and five energy drinks.
You want any?
Oh, and take this away.

19:14.556 --> 19:16.160
What, are you
trying to kill us?

19:16.262 --> 19:18.163
Who still serves bread
at a restaurant?

19:18.265 --> 19:19.561
Might as well feed us
a pack of cigarettes.

19:19.663 --> 19:21.100
- You don't smoke, do you?
- [cell phone ringing]

19:21.203 --> 19:24.297
Well, hang on.
That's the production. Hello?

19:24.399 --> 19:26.671
Yeah, I'm with Mr. Pronto.

19:26.773 --> 19:27.801
Wait, what?

19:29.107 --> 19:32.212
Slow down. What? What?

19:32.943 --> 19:33.972
Okay.

19:34.914 --> 19:36.883
I'll let him know.

19:36.985 --> 19:39.315
- [cell phone thuds]
- [sighs]

19:39.417 --> 19:41.579
Great news, Latte. Sir
Bingsley's dead.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.152
As some of you may have heard,

19:44.254 --> 19:46.622
Sir Thomas Kit Bingsley

19:47.554 --> 19:49.257
died a few hours ago.

19:49.359 --> 19:50.763
- [murmuring]
- [woman] Died?

19:50.865 --> 19:52.161
[man] Who? What? How is...

19:52.263 --> 19:53.327
Of course, there's gonna be

19:53.429 --> 19:56.031
a complete autopsy eventually,

19:56.700 --> 19:59.797
<i>but it appears</i>
<i>that he asphyxiated himself,</i>

19:59.899 --> 20:02.373
presumably while trying
to find some truth

20:02.475 --> 20:05.740
for the big hanging scene
we're shooting tomorrow.

20:08.314 --> 20:11.515
The asphyxiation
may also have been...

20:13.184 --> 20:15.087
autoerotic in nature.

20:15.189 --> 20:16.685
- [all exclaiming]
- Now, that makes sense.

20:16.787 --> 20:20.722
We, we-- we don't know and--
and it's all very unclear.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.296
Uh, but I think it was.

20:25.428 --> 20:26.727
- Wow.
- Well, that was stupid.

20:26.829 --> 20:30.068
Now, I'd like to take
a moment to speak towards

20:30.170 --> 20:32.904
what-- what Tommy
would've wanted.

20:33.006 --> 20:35.207
He, of course, would say,

20:35.309 --> 20:38.307
"Let's stop filming,
can the entire movie."

20:38.409 --> 20:40.278
- What? That's crazy.
- Yeah.

20:40.380 --> 20:43.208
No, no, we gave it a go.
You know, we tried.

20:43.678 --> 20:46.847
But you all know
and would agree,

20:48.154 --> 20:49.722
Tommy was a fuckin' asshole.

20:49.824 --> 20:50.883
- Yes.
- Well...

20:50.985 --> 20:52.722
- Yeah, he was.
- He was a bit of an asshole.

20:52.824 --> 20:55.754
- [all chattering]
- That's the long
and short of it.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.427
But we're gonna
finish this movie

20:57.529 --> 20:59.357
and we're gonna finish it
with that guy.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.961
[all chattering]

21:03.467 --> 21:05.734
- [man] Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

21:06.741 --> 21:09.474
[laughing]

21:09.576 --> 21:11.773
Got no time to lose.
Can't let them
change their minds.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.946
This is big time.
Move outta the way.
Move, move!

21:15.048 --> 21:16.248
Stars coming through.

21:16.350 --> 21:19.214
Hey, Latte. Welcome.
Welcome to your team.

21:19.316 --> 21:20.649
You got me, your agent.

21:20.751 --> 21:23.189
I'll handle all incoming calls.
I take ten percent.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.454
Got your manager.
He'll manage affairs.

21:25.556 --> 21:27.860
Ten percent also.
It's industry standard.

21:27.962 --> 21:28.986
Got your business manager.

21:29.089 --> 21:31.497
He'll manage business affairs.
Five percent.

21:31.599 --> 21:34.259
Got your lawyer,
litigation, of course.
Five percent too.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.100
Got your publicist,
you know him,
we'll put him on a weekly.

21:37.202 --> 21:38.435
Stylist. Weekly, also.

21:38.537 --> 21:40.940
We got a personal assistant.
She's hourly.

21:41.042 --> 21:42.408
Plus, we got you an intern.

21:43.538 --> 21:45.039
Good news is he's free.

21:45.775 --> 21:48.375
- [whispering indistinctly]
- Really? Hmm.

21:48.477 --> 21:52.047
Well, I guess there's a law
against that now,
so you'll have to pay him too.

21:52.149 --> 21:53.551
[Lenny] Ah.

21:55.586 --> 21:58.286
Ah, Latte. Who's got
your back, huh?

21:58.388 --> 22:01.391
You know, the studio was gonna
stick you in some hotel
or apartment somewhere,

22:01.493 --> 22:03.092
but I talked
some sense into them.

22:03.194 --> 22:04.956
Look at this spot.

22:05.059 --> 22:07.565
It's perfect for you,
Latte. Think about it.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.562
You can look over the streets
you once begged on.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.834
Latte Pronto killing it.

22:14.772 --> 22:17.509
- [distant sirens blaring]
- [insects trilling]

22:23.314 --> 22:26.914
[floorboards creaking]

22:35.391 --> 22:37.628
[soft music playing]

23:01.649 --> 23:03.549
[soft music continues]

23:03.651 --> 23:05.854
[distant siren blaring]

23:26.812 --> 23:28.777
[Lenny] Latte! What, are you
trying to sleep out here?

23:28.879 --> 23:31.511
What are you looking for?
Drugs? That's no good.

23:31.613 --> 23:35.221
Look, I can get you some
if you need it, but we can't
have that in the papers.

23:35.323 --> 23:36.848
No, I've been
following you all night.

23:36.950 --> 23:38.455
I was parked
outside your house,

23:38.557 --> 23:39.586
waiting to take you
to set tomorrow,

23:39.688 --> 23:41.321
but enough is enough, buddy.

23:41.423 --> 23:44.023
Gosh, you gotta be
on set in two hours.
You're gonna be exhausted.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.464
I mean, I like a good walk
as much as anybody,

23:46.567 --> 23:47.962
but let's not make a habit
out of this, okay?

23:48.064 --> 23:49.798
- Walking around the street?
- Walking around outside?

23:49.900 --> 23:51.765
- The streets of LA?
- You could've been mugged.

23:51.867 --> 23:53.271
That's insane.
Nobody walks in LA.

23:53.373 --> 23:54.604
Have the studio
call a car for you.

23:54.707 --> 23:56.135
- Are you serious right now?
- [overlapping]

23:56.237 --> 23:58.737
Looking really-- it's looking
blotchy on this side.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.138
- On this side...
- Wake up.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.711
- Oh, my God, this is insane.
- [knock on door]

24:01.813 --> 24:03.349
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
knocking on the door again?

24:03.451 --> 24:05.309
- Wow, wow.
- He just got in the chair!

24:05.411 --> 24:08.317
I need you not to rush me,
all right? Where is the wig?

24:08.419 --> 24:10.182
[Tony] Cameras rolling.

24:11.155 --> 24:12.423
Action.

24:12.525 --> 24:13.884
[Christiana]
Don't leave me, Billy.

24:14.487 --> 24:17.561
You leave me, Billy,
I swear to God,
I'll blow my brains out.

24:17.663 --> 24:20.526
Christ. He can barely
keep his eyes open.

24:20.628 --> 24:21.966
Just keep rolling.

24:22.068 --> 24:24.166
Latte. Open.

24:24.268 --> 24:26.872
Open. Eyes open.

24:26.974 --> 24:28.104
I mean it, Bill.

24:28.706 --> 24:30.973
What does that other girl
have on me, huh?

24:31.742 --> 24:34.211
Is it the tobacco?
'Cause I can quit that.

24:34.313 --> 24:35.546
[Tony] Why is he smiling?

24:35.649 --> 24:36.811
There's nothing
in the script about smiling.

24:36.913 --> 24:38.813
I-- I know there's nothing
in the script.

24:38.915 --> 24:40.979
Look, he's about to leave
his wife, right?

24:41.081 --> 24:43.487
And I can't have him
smiling! [grunts]

24:43.589 --> 24:46.886
Latte. Latte, no.
No, no smiling.

24:46.988 --> 24:49.788
The script says,
"Look sorrowful," so...

24:49.890 --> 24:51.830
[producer] Just do nothing!

24:51.933 --> 24:54.266
It doesn't say do nothing.
It actually says,
"Look sorrowful,"

24:54.368 --> 24:56.733
- if you have the sides.
- Elaine?

24:56.835 --> 24:58.367
- I'm just gonna...
- [Tony sighs] Oh, God...

24:58.469 --> 25:00.801
Bill, is it my clothes?

25:00.903 --> 25:03.503
My hair? Is it the fact
that we's cousins?

25:03.605 --> 25:05.673
He's blinking now.

25:05.775 --> 25:08.311
Look at... [sighs]
Look at her.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.015
Look, look, look at her.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.620
Her. Yeah, yeah, look at the--
the pretty dirty lady.

25:15.251 --> 25:16.522
Yes!

25:16.624 --> 25:19.658
Have it your way, Billy.
I hate your guts, anyway.

25:22.463 --> 25:25.392
Now she's doing it.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:25.494 --> 25:26.761
[sighs] Cut!

25:26.863 --> 25:28.968
- [buzzer blaring]
- [Tony] Moving on.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.398
I think we got it.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.962
[people chattering]

25:32.065 --> 25:33.772
Are you ready
for this next bit?

25:33.874 --> 25:35.901
I'm gonna come at you hard, bro.
You better start stretchin'.

25:36.003 --> 25:38.108
Stretch 'em out now.
Stretch 'em out.

25:38.210 --> 25:39.337
[Chad grunts]

25:42.578 --> 25:44.848
[grunts] Fuck. Ugh.

25:46.416 --> 25:47.950
[snoring]

25:51.158 --> 25:53.156
That's what you get.

25:53.258 --> 25:54.490
[spits] Dumbass.

25:54.592 --> 25:56.821
[tense dramatic music playing]

25:56.923 --> 25:58.323
[Chad] How did that feel?

26:00.596 --> 26:04.869
I'm gonna kill you,
Billy, you no good,
woman-stealing sack of shit.

26:04.971 --> 26:06.701
Hmm?

26:06.803 --> 26:08.670
- Yeah, that's it!
- More pain.

26:08.772 --> 26:10.539
- Harder! Harder!
- More pain!

26:10.641 --> 26:13.041
Come on, now,
get on up there.

26:13.574 --> 26:14.476
Yeah.

26:14.578 --> 26:17.181
Yes, yes,
it's great. Yes!

26:17.283 --> 26:19.915
Yeah. Messin' around

26:20.017 --> 26:22.685
- with another man's wife.
- [Tony] Excellent!

26:22.787 --> 26:24.256
- More struggle.
- [Chad] There's rules.

26:24.358 --> 26:26.288
There are rules to this, Billy.

26:26.924 --> 26:29.022
- You gonna pay the price now.
- More pain!

26:29.124 --> 26:31.492
- More pain, it hurts!
- [Chad grunting]

26:32.027 --> 26:34.628
Nice, huh? That's nice
and tight, huh?

26:34.730 --> 26:36.567
Yeah. Now, how that feel?

26:36.669 --> 26:39.001
- That's it. Perfect.
- [Tony laughs]

26:40.967 --> 26:42.541
Can I get you a coffee, sir?

26:42.643 --> 26:45.007
Or did you wanna sit?
Let me get you a chair.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.412
Hey, bud. How you feelin'?

26:47.514 --> 26:49.114
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.749
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

26:51.850 --> 26:54.382
You were good.
You were good,
I felt the fear.

26:54.484 --> 26:55.580
It was palpable.

26:56.417 --> 26:59.719
Yeah, I go half method
these days, yeah. [chuckles]

26:59.821 --> 27:00.988
Used to go full method.

27:01.090 --> 27:03.192
But, uh, you know,
some people got hurt.

27:03.294 --> 27:04.997
Not me.

27:05.099 --> 27:05.858
[clears throat]

27:05.961 --> 27:07.832
Kinda like Tommy,
you know.

27:09.566 --> 27:10.868
Couldn't handle it.

27:12.639 --> 27:14.407
Amazing how much
you look like him, huh?

27:14.509 --> 27:16.472
It's like, it's
truly remarkable.

27:16.574 --> 27:17.872
[chuckles] It's uncanny.

27:17.974 --> 27:19.171
Can I get you guys
some chairs, or--

27:19.273 --> 27:20.978
No, no, no.
We're good.
We're good.

27:22.081 --> 27:26.611
Hey, I just want to tell you
that I dig what you're doing.

27:27.480 --> 27:32.856
Really, I just think,
like, words are overrated.

27:32.958 --> 27:34.585
You know? They're such
crutches for us as actors.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.560
- Can I get you guys
some chairs?
- No. We're standing.

27:38.296 --> 27:41.498
You know, Spielberg said
that you should be able
to watch a movie

27:41.600 --> 27:42.962
with the sound off if it's...

27:43.064 --> 27:45.566
Hey, guys.
Got those chairs for you--

27:45.668 --> 27:47.069
Get 'em outta here.

27:50.975 --> 27:52.641
You know, sometimes
I'll go to the movies

27:52.743 --> 27:55.077
and I'll plug my ears. Yup.

27:55.179 --> 27:58.116
I'll even go the extra mile
and close my eyes too.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.751
[inhales deeply]

27:59.853 --> 28:03.588
Yeah. You know, to really
experience something,

28:03.690 --> 28:05.956
you have to completely
shut it out.

28:07.495 --> 28:10.488
I did that
with my ex-wife too.

28:10.590 --> 28:15.262
Yeah, didn't talk to her
or look at her for a month once.

28:16.502 --> 28:18.067
She didn't get it at all.

28:19.870 --> 28:21.673
Hey, I'm throwing
a party tonight.

28:21.775 --> 28:24.404
You'll love it. But, uh,
I'll give you a ride.

28:24.506 --> 28:27.910
I'm gonna go do some push-ups.
Get jacked for this one. Ah.

28:28.012 --> 28:30.813
[clears throat]
I got your chair, Mr. Pronto.

28:30.915 --> 28:32.477
They're ready
for you, Mr. Pronto.

28:33.749 --> 28:34.880
[tires screeching]

28:34.982 --> 28:37.757
[upbeat music playing]

28:44.364 --> 28:45.391
Have some of that.

28:47.096 --> 28:48.826
James Dean died
right over there.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.995
[engine revving]

28:51.097 --> 28:52.532
[Chad] Terrible tragedy.

28:53.469 --> 28:56.974
Except I got the big brake kit
in this baby. Watch it go.

28:57.677 --> 29:00.278
- [engine revving]
- [laughing]

29:00.380 --> 29:01.846
Yeah, motherfucker!

29:01.948 --> 29:04.447
Hold the wheel.
Stay straight,
stay straight.

29:04.549 --> 29:05.878
[tires screeching]

29:05.980 --> 29:07.353
Where the fuck is it?

29:07.455 --> 29:10.356
- [gun clicks]
- [laughs]

29:10.458 --> 29:12.289
- [gunshots]
- [Chad yelling]

29:12.391 --> 29:15.227
Whoo! Yeah!

29:15.329 --> 29:17.060
[yelling, laughing]

29:20.201 --> 29:21.163
[sizzles]

29:22.934 --> 29:24.802
- [glass shatters]
- What the fuck?

29:24.904 --> 29:27.770
That was a fresh
fuckin' drink, douchebag!

29:27.872 --> 29:29.675
Ugh, Christ.
Who the fuck does that?

29:29.777 --> 29:31.940
This party sucks.
And this house sucks.

29:32.042 --> 29:33.272
Hey, have any of you
seen my boyfriend?

29:33.374 --> 29:35.547
Hello? No one? None of you
have seen Greg?

29:35.649 --> 29:37.811

50:46.680 --> 50:48.852
- [drum pounding]
- [chanting indistinctly]

50:48.954 --> 50:50.016
- [thuds]
- Good, we're done.

50:50.118 --> 50:51.384
I really do apologize

50:51.487 --> 50:54.191
for getting a little bit
of wax in your eyeball.

50:55.490 --> 50:59.028
So, today's session
will be 6,000 dollars,

50:59.130 --> 51:01.493
and, uh, for check
writing purposes,

51:01.596 --> 51:03.431
I know I told you my name
is Mountain Bride,

51:03.533 --> 51:06.663
but, uh, if you could
make it out to Shelley Gube.

51:06.765 --> 51:09.072
- We are mosquito people now.
- [laughing]

51:09.174 --> 51:10.908
- We sure are.
- Isn't that right, Latte?

51:11.010 --> 51:12.877
My psychic said
it was gonna happen.

51:12.979 --> 51:14.276
I knew we were gonna
work together again.

51:14.378 --> 51:15.473
- We are so excited.
- Have you been working out?

51:15.575 --> 51:17.080
We're so excited.
You look so good.

51:17.182 --> 51:18.545
You do, it looks like
you've been in the sun.

51:18.647 --> 51:20.347
- Have you gotten sun?
You've gotten sun.
- Yeah.

51:20.449 --> 51:22.517
I feel like--
have you been using that--

51:23.053 --> 51:24.552
- Which line?
- Hey, boss?

51:24.654 --> 51:26.588
I know you're waiting
on number one
to jump out of HMU,

51:26.690 --> 51:29.725
but I want you to know
that FX is all set
and ready to pop, okay?

51:29.827 --> 51:30.994
What the hell is this?

51:31.563 --> 51:34.294
This is your tennis ball
cannon, okay? We're set,
we're ready to go.

51:34.396 --> 51:35.660
I got your speed,
I got your violence,

51:35.762 --> 51:37.561
I got your velocity,
I got all you can handle.

51:37.663 --> 51:39.067
Okay, I thought it was
gonna be like a--

51:39.169 --> 51:40.971
Like a handheld thing
so you can--

51:41.073 --> 51:42.404
That's-- that's not
what I was told.

51:42.506 --> 51:44.234
Talk to your production
designer. Watch your face.

51:44.336 --> 51:46.976
But we're gonna be over here.
I'm on 13. You tell me
anything you need.

51:47.078 --> 51:48.042
- All right?
- Excellent. Thank you.

51:48.144 --> 51:49.510
You look great in that hat.

51:50.517 --> 51:51.614
Thank you.

51:51.716 --> 51:53.818
[metal clanking]

51:53.920 --> 51:56.513
Oh, um...
Ugh, this is Victor.

51:56.615 --> 51:58.583
He specializes
in monster makeup.

51:58.686 --> 52:00.523
He'll be applying
your mosquito prosthetics,

52:00.625 --> 52:02.654
- so good luck with that.
- [woman 1] Just hold
your breath.

52:02.756 --> 52:04.160
- [woman 2] Wow.
- [woman 1] Hold your breath.

52:04.262 --> 52:05.625
[woman 2] You look like
the Mosquito already.

52:05.727 --> 52:08.564
[woman 1] It's almost on
your face. Just count to three.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.927
[rumbling]

52:14.334 --> 52:16.570
[tense music playing]

52:20.776 --> 52:21.740
Oh!

52:27.016 --> 52:28.747
Okay, let's do this.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.282
Okay, so, uh,
here's the action.

52:31.384 --> 52:32.954
You got tennis ball one.

52:33.056 --> 52:34.254
That's gonna be Crow Man.

52:34.356 --> 52:35.757
All right?
Crow Man comes at you.

52:35.859 --> 52:37.058
Ah! You duck.

52:37.160 --> 52:38.458
Tennis balls two and three,

52:38.561 --> 52:41.397
those are blasts
from his bug spray cannons.

52:41.499 --> 52:43.532
All right, they hit you.
Okay, then I need a, you know,

52:43.634 --> 52:46.062
"Oh, shit, I'm down. Crow Man's
gonna eat me," kind of face.

52:46.164 --> 52:47.871
And that's when you do your
eye thing right to the camera.

52:47.973 --> 52:49.639
You ready? Here we go, folks.

52:49.741 --> 52:51.574
And playtime.

52:52.044 --> 52:53.607
- [ball fires]
- [ball thuds]

52:54.540 --> 52:55.739
Okay, let's-- let's do it again.

52:55.841 --> 52:57.941
Again, you gotta duck.
All right, buddy?

52:58.043 --> 53:01.345
Just don't let it hit you.
Just, you know, avoid it.

53:01.981 --> 53:04.253
- Gotta get down, big time.
- No, that's all right.

53:04.356 --> 53:05.751
I got it, I'll direct him,
if you don't mind.

53:05.853 --> 53:07.885
All right, this one's coming
real quick, real quick,

53:07.987 --> 53:10.419
so get ready to duck.
All right, ready and playtime.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.589
[ball fires, thuds]

53:11.691 --> 53:13.457
- Playtime!
- [ball fires, thuds]

53:13.560 --> 53:15.266
- And playtime!
- [fires, thuds]

53:15.368 --> 53:17.365
- All right, now you hit him.
- [firing, thudding]

53:17.468 --> 53:19.804
[Lex] More, more juice.
Come on, hit him harder!

53:19.906 --> 53:21.303
More speed. Faster, faster!

53:21.405 --> 53:22.568
You're likin' it now.
Right, tell your talent

53:22.670 --> 53:24.000
- to slow down a little bit.
- Playtime!

53:26.275 --> 53:28.975
Ugh! Cut! Nose came off, Victor.

53:29.077 --> 53:31.074
[buzzer blaring]

53:32.110 --> 53:34.180
- [machine whirring]
- [woman 2] You're like
cool-going.

53:34.282 --> 53:35.652
[man] You look so good.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.052
Okay, okay.

53:37.154 --> 53:38.253
This is gonna get really bad.

53:38.355 --> 53:40.418
- [saw buzzing]
- Oh, God. [laughs]

53:40.520 --> 53:42.388
- [overlapping chatter]
- Ooh!

53:42.490 --> 53:43.855
All right, Latte,
here's the deal.

53:43.957 --> 53:45.290
We're gonna help you out
with the choreography now, okay?

53:45.392 --> 53:47.059
So, uh, let's get ready.

53:47.161 --> 53:49.498
[rope reeling]

53:50.565 --> 53:52.166
- Here we come.
- [launcher cocks]

53:52.269 --> 53:54.003
- And playtime.
- [ball fires]

53:54.106 --> 53:55.706
- [ball thuds]
- [ball fires]

53:55.808 --> 53:58.275
[firing, thudding]

53:58.377 --> 54:01.637
And playtime. More speed.
Come on. Beautiful!

54:01.740 --> 54:03.512
- [balls firing]
- [rope reeling]

54:04.611 --> 54:06.249
- And cut!
- [buzzer blaring]

54:06.351 --> 54:08.451
All right, that's a wrap
for today, everyone.

54:09.547 --> 54:12.323
[indistinct chatter]

54:17.027 --> 54:18.757
Latte. Energy drink?

54:19.359 --> 54:24.064
Nope? Good news, bud.
I got you into the<i> Sexism</i>
magazine party. [laughs]

54:24.166 --> 54:26.863
I think that's what it's called.
Sounds wrong now that
I'm saying out loud.

54:26.966 --> 54:29.869
Anyway, big-time publication,
classy stuff,

54:29.971 --> 54:32.242
and I'm pushing to get you
on the cover, but it's tough.

54:32.344 --> 54:34.141
They normally go
for a monster set of cans.

54:34.243 --> 54:35.643
Okay, we gotta roll, hmm?

54:36.648 --> 54:37.612
Oh.

54:39.213 --> 54:40.415
Let's go.

54:40.517 --> 54:44.487
["Nights On Broadway"
by Bee Gees playing]

54:47.156 --> 54:50.460
[speaking loudly]

55:42.310 --> 55:44.811
[insects trilling]

55:48.947 --> 55:51.917
- [engine revving]
- [gunshots firing]

55:54.926 --> 55:55.987
[Chad sighs]

55:58.095 --> 55:59.722
Oh. [clears throat]

55:59.824 --> 56:01.429
- Oh, shit.

56:01.531 --> 56:04.363
- [belt jangling]
- [rat squeaking]

56:04.465 --> 56:06.437
I just pissed on a rat.

56:07.570 --> 56:11.007
Oh, man, I love it
down here. [inhales]

56:11.109 --> 56:12.839
I can just see the air.

56:13.945 --> 56:16.410
[sighing]

56:16.512 --> 56:19.417
Parties, man,
they're so cliché.

56:21.018 --> 56:22.079
Like words.

56:23.350 --> 56:24.620
You want some?

56:26.726 --> 56:29.259
[sighs]

56:29.361 --> 56:31.528
Yeah, it's real
small batch stuff.

56:32.095 --> 56:33.931
[clears throat]

56:34.033 --> 56:36.031
Yeah, I made it myself.

56:36.133 --> 56:37.932
I'm into that, yeah.

56:38.568 --> 56:40.966

indoor farming.

56:41.566 --> 56:43.673
Oh, and gold.

56:44.409 --> 56:46.642
Yeah, I got pockets
full of it, yeah.

56:47.979 --> 56:49.007
Want some?

56:49.981 --> 56:50.807
Yeah, here.

56:51.376 --> 56:55.384
Yeah, I make rings
and bottle openers
and whatever, yeah.

56:55.486 --> 56:57.587
Keep it, keep it.
That one's, uh...

56:58.320 --> 56:59.655
That one's, uh...

57:01.725 --> 57:03.354
I think that one's
a paperweight, I think. Yeah.

57:03.456 --> 57:05.823
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [paparazzo] Chad,
Latte! Over here!

57:05.925 --> 57:09.199
[grunts] These fuckin'
guys. Hey, man.

57:09.301 --> 57:10.663
Hey, man,
you think I'm some--

57:10.765 --> 57:12.566
You think I'm some
animal in the zoo

57:12.668 --> 57:13.999
you could just take
a picture of?

57:14.101 --> 57:15.371
- [paparazzo] Easy!
- Huh? Is that what you think?

57:15.473 --> 57:16.804
- Get off me, man. I'll sue.
- Huh?

57:16.906 --> 57:18.306
- What am I, just a cow
in the zoo...
- Get off me!

57:18.408 --> 57:19.507
...you can take a picture of?

57:19.609 --> 57:21.007
- Moo!
- Get off me, man. Get off me.

57:21.109 --> 57:22.712
Moo!

now face your right.

57:30.321 --> 57:32.319
Nope, sir, face the camera.

57:32.421 --> 57:34.256
Nope, sir, we're not done.

[groovy music playing on radio]

57:40.559 --> 57:41.928
[Lenny sighs]

57:45.434 --> 57:47.032
Look, I'm not mad at you.

57:47.907 --> 57:48.935
I get it.

57:50.305 --> 57:51.273
[brakes squeal]

57:51.375 --> 57:52.972
You gotta let off some stream.

57:53.872 --> 57:55.343
You know, sow your wild oats.

57:55.445 --> 57:57.614
But do not blow this for me!

57:58.514 --> 58:00.050
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

58:00.152 --> 58:01.448
No, look, I'm your guy.

58:01.550 --> 58:03.554
I got your back no matter what.

58:04.583 --> 58:05.853
No matter what.

58:07.225 --> 58:08.625
I'm always on your side.

58:13.061 --> 58:16.364
So, Latte, what are you,
big time now? You a hotshot?

58:16.467 --> 58:17.997
- Don't be a hotshot.
- Shh.

58:18.099 --> 58:20.536
I-- I don't wanna deal
with your macho shenanigans.

58:20.639 --> 58:23.173
Listen to me.
These outbursts,
they gotta stop.

58:23.276 --> 58:24.474
- They gotta stop.
- Shut up.

58:24.576 --> 58:26.076
The head of the studio,
he's coming down here

58:26.178 --> 58:27.742
right now
to chew you out.

58:27.844 --> 58:29.542
- This is a problem.
- This isn't good, Latte.

58:29.645 --> 58:31.106
Just stop it.
This is not good.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.848
They are mumbling
about replacing you.

58:32.950 --> 58:35.917
- Are mumbling about
replacing you--
- Just shut up!

58:36.019 --> 58:36.983
You!

58:37.586 --> 58:39.323
Now you listen here, you...

- ...Boy,<i> Mosquito Boy</i> .

58:49.030 --> 58:52.636
I mean, we've already spent,
uh, two million...

58:53.434 --> 58:54.736
Two million...

58:54.838 --> 58:56.236
- [whispers indistinctly]
- Two hundred million

58:56.338 --> 58:57.740

58:57.842 --> 59:00.177
And I'm not gonna spend
one more cent on your dumbass

[elevator music playing]

59:27.072 --> 59:28.166
[clears throat]

59:29.273 --> 59:30.737
Hey, uh, Mr. Pronto,

59:30.839 --> 59:33.574
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

59:33.676 --> 59:35.372
- I'm-- I'm your stand-in.
- Ah.

59:35.474 --> 59:39.617
I stand on, you know, your marks
while they light the scenes.

59:40.550 --> 59:42.246
It's a huge honor to meet you.

59:43.082 --> 59:46.523
I really respect all--
all you, every--

59:46.626 --> 59:48.191
your whole story of how
you made it, honestly.

59:48.293 --> 59:49.488
Thank you, thank you.

59:50.157 --> 59:52.289
- You're a real
inspiration to me.
- Yeah.

59:55.467 --> 59:56.930
- It's so cool to be...
- Okay.

59:57.032 --> 59:59.763
- ...in an elevator with you.
- Yeah. We get it.

59:59.865 --> 01:00:00.932
[elevator bell dings]

01:00:01.034 --> 01:00:02.231
I'm just so impressed
with your talent

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.571
and I respect the fights
you get in and stuff,

01:00:03.673 --> 01:00:04.670
- but I--
- Will you get away?

01:00:04.772 --> 01:00:05.871
- Yes, sir, sorry.
- Geez.

01:00:05.973 --> 01:00:07.342
- [chuckles] Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

01:00:07.444 --> 01:00:09.378
Good to have you back.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.111
Excuse me.
Hey, uh, look,

01:00:11.213 --> 01:00:13.115
I just wanna talk you through
the stunt we're doing today,

01:00:13.217 --> 01:00:15.517
and then I'll get you
through hair and makeup
and all that shit, okay?

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.080
- Good plan.
- Hey, shut up, please.

01:00:17.182 --> 01:00:18.584
Thank you. All right,
come with me.

01:00:18.686 --> 01:00:20.050
Okay, so, here's the scene.

01:00:20.152 --> 01:00:21.820
You get chased up
to this rooftop, right,

01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:23.527
by, uh, Crow Man's
henchman, right,

01:00:23.629 --> 01:00:24.788
because you got
the secret blood formula.

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.190
And it's inside your nose

01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:27.896
or whatever the fuck,
I don't know. But anyway,

01:00:27.998 --> 01:00:29.961
you've been backed into
this corner right here, right?

01:00:30.063 --> 01:00:32.362
And-- no way out.
What's gonna happen?

01:00:32.464 --> 01:00:35.568
For the first time,
this is when you sprout
your wings,

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.840
you jump and then you fly.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.745
Right? Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, don't worry.

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:44.540
Don't worry, no stress, okay?
It's easy. All right?

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:47.881
All you gotta do is just go over
and let gravity do the rest.

01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:50.115
Latte, all the top guys
do their own stunts.

01:00:50.217 --> 01:00:51.888
- Mm-hmm. Will you
fuck off, please?
- Okay.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.088
Yeah, thank you.
All right, here, listen.
This stuff is easy.

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.424
You know what?
We'll rehearse one.
You'll get a feel for it.

01:00:56.526 --> 01:00:57.726
Hey, are my henchmen ready?

01:00:57.828 --> 01:01:00.928
Okay, so, all right,
here we go. And playtime!

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:05.300
- [actors shouting]
- [dramatic music playing]

01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:07.166
[weapons clanking]

01:01:10.571 --> 01:01:12.971
[shattering]

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:15.706
[nurse speaking
indistinctly on PA]

01:01:15.808 --> 01:01:19.915
[monitor beeping]

01:01:24.816 --> 01:01:26.949
There he is.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.891
You're lucky to be alive.

01:01:30.492 --> 01:01:32.059
Energy drink?

01:01:33.495 --> 01:01:35.060
No? Okay.

01:01:35.162 --> 01:01:38.395
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

01:01:40.138 --> 01:01:41.168
[sighs]

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.868
Latte, I can't actually see you.

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.607
I've had a little work done

01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:47.102
and I have to wear
these bandages

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.106
for another week or so, but...

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:51.341
I understand you're
in terrible shape.

01:01:51.443 --> 01:01:54.081
Well, I'm glad you're alive,
I really, truly am,

01:01:54.183 --> 01:01:58.116
but I can't take these wild
emotional swings anymore.

01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.821
You're getting arrested
and then the lawsuits,

01:02:00.923 --> 01:02:02.686
and now this attempt
on your own life.

01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:05.221
Well... [sighs]

01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:07.930
There's no easy way
to say it, but...

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.460
we're getting divorced.

01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:14.266
I'm with Chad now.

01:02:15.674 --> 01:02:17.907
- Where is he?
- [Chad] I'm over here.

01:02:21.313 --> 01:02:23.044
[sighs] Sorry, bro.

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.048
[Christiana] Take care, Latte.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.784
Oh...

01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:34.121
- [PA system beeps]
- [indistinct PA announcement]

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.288
Bummer.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.058
Well, look on the bright side.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.298
They finished the film
with your stand-in

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.358
and word on the street,

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.429
and I don't want you
to get too excited,

01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:48.335
is that it's the best movie
in the history of filmmaking.

01:02:48.437 --> 01:02:49.339
[sighs]

01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:50.704
"One of the worst movies

01:02:50.806 --> 01:02:52.876
in the history of filmmaking"?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:55.337
"Latte Pronto's old tricks
of breaking the fourth wall

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:58.340
grow older than
a fossilized mosquito.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.749
In this he sucks
more than just blood."

01:03:00.851 --> 01:03:02.315
Okay, guys,
let's keep it going, huh?

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:05.081
I got you a second truck so it
wouldn't take forever. Let's go.

01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:06.850
What the hell's
going on here?

01:03:07.453 --> 01:03:08.920
- What are you doing?
What is that?
- Oh.

01:03:09.022 --> 01:03:10.085
What's going on here, guys?

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.057
Hey, Latte, how you doin'?

01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:14.124
Remember me?
I'm your business manager.

01:03:14.226 --> 01:03:15.965
Yeah, a little bit
of bad news.

01:03:16.067 --> 01:03:19.736
Uh, it looks like between
the shamans, the divorce,

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.570
and your expensive lifestyle
in general,

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.837
you-- you don't have any monies.

01:03:23.939 --> 01:03:25.572
Isn't it your job
to make him money?

01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.574
You from the IRS?

01:03:27.676 --> 01:03:28.973
No, I'm an intern.

01:03:29.075 --> 01:03:30.645
Oh, well, then the answer is no,

01:03:30.747 --> 01:03:32.075
it's my job to make me money.

01:03:32.177 --> 01:03:34.647
That's what a job is. [laughs]

01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:36.579
- Nice.
- Yeah.

01:03:37.488 --> 01:03:38.751
Do you need an intern?

01:03:38.853 --> 01:03:39.984
[manager] I can't pay you.

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:41.625
[intern] Legally you'd have to.

01:03:41.727 --> 01:03:42.822
Well, no, there's
ways around that.

01:03:42.924 --> 01:03:44.725
You got a lot to learn, kid.

01:03:44.827 --> 01:03:46.088
You want the job or what, eh?

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.060
- Sure.
- Ah, good move.

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.230
You're gonna do
very well in this town.

01:03:50.332 --> 01:03:52.732
Now, go get me a coffee
and keep the receipt, okay?

01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:53.865
[intern] Oh, no problem.

01:03:53.967 --> 01:03:55.400
Take care, Mr. Pronto.

01:03:58.076 --> 01:04:01.772
Latte, things turn around
for you, you gimme a call, okay?

01:04:01.874 --> 01:04:03.243
I'm your guy.

01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:04.981
[Lenny] I think it's time
we popped in on your agent

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.146
and let her know you're ready
to get back in the game.

01:04:07.249 --> 01:04:08.877
And there's nothing to panic
about here, pal.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.152
You're still an A-list guy,
so let's keep
our heads up, right?

01:04:12.254 --> 01:04:15.659
Hi, I'm here with Latte Pronto
to see his agent.

01:04:15.761 --> 01:04:17.820
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's in a meeting.

01:04:17.923 --> 01:04:19.157
We can wait.

01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:21.525
Well, she has a lot
of meetings today.

01:04:21.627 --> 01:04:24.493
How can you-- How do you know?
What is-- You know what?

01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:28.297
You can't do this.
I'm here with Latte Pronto.

01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:29.900
- Uh-huh?
- Do you know who he is?

01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:31.937
He's an A-list guy.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.710
- Uh-huh, right.
- No, he's an--

01:04:34.812 --> 01:04:37.273
- He's an A-list guy!
- Right.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.378
You can't do this,
and you know what?

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.585
I need to talk to your--
No, I don't-- We're going in.

01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:45.481
Hey, you can't go back there!

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:47.519
- [door slams]
- What the hell is going on?

01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:51.628
This some kind of power play?
Latte Pronto is an A-list guy.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.489
He's an A-list
and he wants to work,

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:56.733
so let's get cracking--
Wait, what is this?

01:04:56.835 --> 01:04:58.767
Look, I would love
to help you guys,

01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:00.534
but between the fighting
and the ODs,

01:05:00.636 --> 01:05:03.166
and most importantly,
the bad movie,
the phone's just not ringing.

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:05.306
What-- You put him
in that movie.

01:05:05.408 --> 01:05:10.006
What do you want me to say?
The phone... is not... ringing.

01:05:10.108 --> 01:05:11.580
What the-- [grumbles]

01:05:11.682 --> 01:05:13.609
Well, then call somebody.

01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:16.214
Look, why don't you just lay low
for a little while?

01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:17.479
I'll call you
if something comes up.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.187
Right now, there's just
nothing happening.

01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:21.318
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.321
You remember
your stand-in, right?

01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:26.424
Is this has-been
gonna take up all my time?

01:05:26.526 --> 01:05:29.361
Get the hell outta here, man.
You make me sick.

01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:32.395
You make me sick!
You're why<i> Mosquito Boy</i> sucked.

01:05:32.497 --> 01:05:35.069
You know what?
We don't need you guys.

01:05:35.171 --> 01:05:37.700
I'll get Latte a gig myself.
You're fired!

01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:00.426
[soft mysterious music playing]

01:06:05.063 --> 01:06:06.300
Come this way.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:08.132
Just down here.

01:06:08.234 --> 01:06:10.337
[people shouting indistinctly]

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:20.743
- This one's mine.
- [distant siren wailing]

01:06:26.222 --> 01:06:28.383
I'm sorry, this place
is a bit of a mess.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.226
Just all about work these days.

01:06:34.196 --> 01:06:39.833
Also, if I'm being
completely honest, I...

01:06:39.935 --> 01:06:41.335
I haven't made much money.

01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:44.767
You're my first real client.

01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:49.508
I'm from a small town
in Northern Canada.

01:06:53.516 --> 01:06:55.882
[voice breaking]
I don't really have
anyone back there.

01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:57.219
Or here, for that matter.

01:07:05.893 --> 01:07:07.130
Except you.

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.104
I'm so grateful to you.

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:17.767
[sniffles] You have no idea.

01:07:19.408 --> 01:07:22.942
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. [sniffles]

01:07:23.044 --> 01:07:25.310
Let me finish. [sniffles]

01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:29.449
Don't worry, pal.
I'll get us back on top.

01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:33.453
It's just baby steps.
It's just baby steps. [mumbles]

01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:37.024
I'll get you in front
of that camera where you belong.

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:39.690
'Cause it only takes
one good gig.

01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:49.100
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:07:49.202 --> 01:07:50.407
[soda can hisses open]

01:07:50.509 --> 01:07:51.841
[sighs] Okay,

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.172
they're reducing
the offer by half,

01:07:53.274 --> 01:07:54.439
but they'll let you
keep the mask.

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.947
I know I used your celebrity
to get the gig,

01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:58.648
but I'm starting to think
it's for the best

01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.774
that you stay anonymous.

01:07:59.877 --> 01:08:02.017
Are you sure you don't need
an energy drink? Mm.

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:04.514
Remember, it's not porn,
it's erotica,

01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:06.651
so just be yourself
and try to have fun.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.325
[woman grunts, sniffles]

01:08:11.624 --> 01:08:16.133
Well, I can't afford
the rent, Mr. Landlord.

01:08:16.235 --> 01:08:19.796
But I'm sure there are some
other ways I can pay you.

01:08:20.737 --> 01:08:22.000
[chuckles]

01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:24.372
Come on, big boy.

01:08:26.374 --> 01:08:29.472
Let's see what we're
workin' with here.

01:08:29.574 --> 01:08:32.548
- Huh? Huh?
- [bed squeaking]

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:33.576
Here. Here.

01:08:33.678 --> 01:08:37.048
What the fuck, Lance?
What is this?

01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:38.653
[director groans]

01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:42.686
Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
You like that, baby?

01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:45.459
You like watching your wife
fuck the landlord

01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:48.825
'cause your limp dick
can't pay the fucking rent?

01:08:50.628 --> 01:08:52.728
Okay. That was not
a great idea.

01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:55.535
Erotica, my ass.
That was definitely pornography.

01:08:55.637 --> 01:08:58.203
We should have tried to book
a sitcom or a commercial.

01:08:58.305 --> 01:08:59.671
No, we went too far, too fast.

01:08:59.773 --> 01:09:01.271
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second. Wait a second.

01:09:01.373 --> 01:09:02.372
Did they see your penis?

01:09:02.474 --> 01:09:04.947
Oh, I can see the papers now.

01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:06.243
Oh, it's the only thing
in showbiz

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:07.444
you can't get away with.

01:09:07.546 --> 01:09:09.551
They'll crucify you!
We'll be ruined!

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:11.119
Mm, mm, mm.

01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:13.690
Okay. Okay, we can put
a good spin on this.

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:16.391
No, no. Ah, there's, uh...

01:09:17.662 --> 01:09:18.756
I just gotta--

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:22.293
Oh, God.

01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:24.498
- [thuds]
- [can clattering]

01:09:32.007 --> 01:09:33.870
[machine beeping]

01:09:45.483 --> 01:09:47.354
Excuse me, Mr. Pronto?

01:09:47.456 --> 01:09:49.721
Could I speak to you
in the hall, please?

01:09:57.234 --> 01:10:00.633
So, there's no easy way
of saying this.

01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:05.166
Could I take a selfie?

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.639
For my wife, really.
She's a big fan!

01:10:08.742 --> 01:10:11.144
This one is stable.
I'll move him down to three.

01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:12.744
I got a dead John Doe here.

01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:15.615
Take him down to cremation.
I'll start the paperwork.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.382
- Oh, this is great.
- [camera clicking]

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:22.384
Oh, this is perfect!

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:23.519
Sorry it's so many.

01:10:23.621 --> 01:10:25.794
Maybe funny faces this time.

01:10:25.896 --> 01:10:27.627
<i>Mosquito Boy</i> sucked!

01:10:29.966 --> 01:10:31.267
Sorry about that.

01:10:31.369 --> 01:10:33.666
Let's take a couple
more pictures. Carol, come here!

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.470
My wife's gonna love this.

01:10:37.573 --> 01:10:41.306
My whole family's
gonna love this. [laughs]

01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.446
Oh. Were you with the patient?

01:10:45.477 --> 01:10:46.775
I'm afraid he passed.

01:10:46.877 --> 01:10:49.286
We just sent him down
to cremation.

01:10:50.586 --> 01:10:53.521
I'm so sorry.
You missed his final moments.

01:10:56.894 --> 01:10:58.658
[machine beeping]

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:03.696
[soft emotional music playing]

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.329
Hello, is anyone there?

01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:07.997
How are you feeling?

01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:11.807
Alive. That's good, I guess.

01:11:11.909 --> 01:11:13.343
That's everything.

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.047
Is there anyone here for me?

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:21.949
Hmm, there was a man,
but he left.

01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:23.452
He didn't come back.

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.656
Hmm... That makes sense.

01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:35.090
I did him wrong, really.

01:11:36.994 --> 01:11:39.094
I never should have
pushed him that hard.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.836
What was I thinking?

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.304
Erotic films?

01:11:48.406 --> 01:11:50.347
I lost my mind.

01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:55.781
I don't always see
the big picture.

01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:08.596
I need to be more observant
to the needs of others
around me.

01:12:15.368 --> 01:12:16.769
[sighs tearfully]

01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:19.637
I mean, you get that.

01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:21.840
That's what you do
all day, right?

01:12:25.443 --> 01:12:27.417
Oh, she's gone.

01:12:28.415 --> 01:12:30.585
[quirky music playing]

01:12:32.387 --> 01:12:34.722
I'm sorry about the epitaph.

01:12:34.824 --> 01:12:39.092
It was the only urn
I had available
in your price range.

01:12:39.828 --> 01:12:45.134
On another note,
I'm a huge fan
of all your movies.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.800
The big ones
and the little ones.

01:12:49.306 --> 01:12:52.068
Catch my drift?
[clicks tongue]

01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:55.241
[emotional music playing]

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:57.913
- [Lenny]<i> Hey, Don.</i>
- [Don on phone]<i> Who's this?</i>

01:12:58.015 --> 01:12:59.080
<i>Oh, it's Lenny.</i>

01:12:59.182 --> 01:13:01.116
- [Don]<i> Who?</i>
- Lenny.

01:13:01.218 --> 01:13:02.447
<i>What-- what number is this?</i>

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:04.680
Oh, it's a new number. New cell.

01:13:04.783 --> 01:13:06.048
<i>No! I told you not to call me.</i>

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.489
From that number.
Yeah, but this is a new number.

01:13:08.591 --> 01:13:09.985
<i>- Don't call me</i>
<i>from any number!</i>
- Okay.

01:13:10.088 --> 01:13:12.462
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>
<i>to you anymore, Lenny!</i>

01:13:14.059 --> 01:13:16.364
- [Lenny] It's solid gold.
- I can see that,

01:13:16.466 --> 01:13:18.193
but you engraved
that stupid saying on it

01:13:18.295 --> 01:13:22.103
- and nobody is gonna
want it now.
- [grumbling]

01:13:22.205 --> 01:13:23.502
Fine. I'll take anything.

01:13:23.604 --> 01:13:25.371
- Nope, it's worthless.
- Please.

01:13:25.473 --> 01:13:27.404
Buddy, it is worthless to me.

01:13:27.506 --> 01:13:29.279
Have some compassion.

01:13:29.381 --> 01:13:31.177
- It's worthless.
- I'm on my last legs.

01:13:31.279 --> 01:13:32.812
- No!
- I...

01:13:34.382 --> 01:13:36.618
[somber music playing]

01:13:39.355 --> 01:13:41.458

[somber music continues]

01:14:17.423 --> 01:14:18.726
Keep in touch.

01:14:22.727 --> 01:14:24.798
[somber music continues]

01:14:38.612 --> 01:14:40.715
Latte, where are you, buddy?

01:14:42.051 --> 01:14:43.146
Latte?

01:14:44.515 --> 01:14:45.819
Latte...

01:14:51.126 --> 01:14:52.529
Latte...

01:14:57.133 --> 01:14:58.667
[crackling]

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.299
[man]<i> Pronto, wake up.</i>

01:15:04.969 --> 01:15:07.372
Pronto, wake up!
Wake up, Pronto!

01:15:07.474 --> 01:15:09.177
It's me, the Dagger.

01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:11.410
You're not safe here.

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.077
Come with me. Come on.

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:15.946
[dogs barking]

01:15:16.049 --> 01:15:19.622
They watching us, man.
They always watching.

01:15:21.257 --> 01:15:22.691
[train horn blaring]

01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:26.662
Come on, this way.

01:15:31.202 --> 01:15:33.196
[quirky music playing]

01:15:40.439 --> 01:15:42.144
There.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.506
Welcome to my hideout.

01:15:44.242 --> 01:15:45.907
The trains disrupt
the government frequencies.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.149
They can't listen to us here.

01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:49.613
We can speak freely.

01:15:50.449 --> 01:15:52.716
Now, I know you think
what's been happening
to your career

01:15:52.818 --> 01:15:55.056
is accidental, or fate even.

01:15:55.692 --> 01:15:58.760
But I'm telling you,
everything is by design.

01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:00.891
Climb a little too high

01:16:00.993 --> 01:16:02.790
and they'll take you
down eventually.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.161
It keeps happening.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:07.069
Bruce Lee, dead.

01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:09.130
Brandon Lee, dead.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.605
George Lopez?
Where the hell is he?

01:16:11.707 --> 01:16:13.006
Is he in that urn
you're holding?

01:16:14.043 --> 01:16:17.474
Inch by inch, they'll try
to erase you from the record.

01:16:17.576 --> 01:16:19.081
I should know.

01:16:19.183 --> 01:16:20.375
It happened to me.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:23.486
I was Kyle Tyson.

01:16:23.588 --> 01:16:26.181
The biggest box office star
in the world.

01:16:26.284 --> 01:16:28.688
Millions of fans,
with a seven-picture deal.

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:31.060
But I must have climbed
a little too high.

01:16:31.595 --> 01:16:34.457
But you know what?
The joke's on them, man.

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:36.799
Because I had the realization.

01:16:36.901 --> 01:16:40.534
They can take away the movies,
and the cars, and the women,

01:16:40.636 --> 01:16:42.567
but they can't take away
the Dagger

01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:44.333
because I am the Dagger!

01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:47.776
And you're the Mosquito.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.306
And I can prove it.

01:16:51.381 --> 01:16:53.847
[quirky music playing]

01:16:53.949 --> 01:16:56.719
See all these cars rushing
here and there to work?

01:16:58.023 --> 01:16:59.153
Watch this.

01:16:59.255 --> 01:17:00.488
By Zeus's sword,

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:03.253
I summon the power
of invisibility!

01:17:11.334 --> 01:17:13.235
[tires screeching]

01:17:13.904 --> 01:17:16.304
Look, they don't even see us.
They're riding right past.

01:17:16.406 --> 01:17:18.169
[cars continue honking]

01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:21.678
You hungry?

01:17:23.543 --> 01:17:24.780
Watch this.

01:17:26.212 --> 01:17:29.686
By Odin's hammer,
freeze these insubordinates!

01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:32.887
[mysterious music playing]

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.387
[quirky music playing]

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.294
You want a bite?

01:17:45.996 --> 01:17:48.334
You see? Look at that.

01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:49.633
That's you.

01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:51.972
Yeah, the Mosquito.

01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:54.373
It's in the universe.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:55.637
And what's this?

01:17:56.407 --> 01:17:59.110
"When emotions get in the way
of your cons.

01:17:59.212 --> 01:18:03.748
Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt
are Emoticons."

01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:05.249
That look like shit, right?

01:18:07.223 --> 01:18:08.252
Oh...

01:18:09.094 --> 01:18:10.188
Hell, man.

01:18:11.923 --> 01:18:13.829
See you later, Lopez.

01:18:14.892 --> 01:18:16.458
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

01:18:19.634 --> 01:18:21.870

01:18:30.843 --> 01:18:32.243
Let's send him off here.

[birds squawking]

01:18:41.153 --> 01:18:44.525
Lopez, you made us laugh,
you made us cry.

01:18:44.627 --> 01:18:46.996
Travel now down the River Styx.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:49.861
May Zuul meet you
at the smoky gates

01:18:49.963 --> 01:18:52.901
with the power
of a thousand daggers.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.308
[birds squawking]

01:19:08.384 --> 01:19:09.412
Damn, man.

01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:11.480
My bad.

01:19:14.687 --> 01:19:17.420
[coughing]

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.329
[choking, coughing]

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:42.084
Good thing you were here.
You saved that guy's life.

01:19:42.186 --> 01:19:43.215
Wait.

01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:45.283
Are you Latte Pronto?

01:19:47.524 --> 01:19:49.053
Oh. [chuckles excitedly]

01:19:49.155 --> 01:19:51.557
Oh, my God, Alvie!
It's Latte Pronto!

01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:53.590
Latte Pronto. Huh?

01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:54.725
[laughs]

01:19:54.827 --> 01:19:56.161
Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:58.731
[sighs] Look, Lenny,
you're just not on the list.

01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:00.703
But you know me by now, Gandhi.

01:20:00.805 --> 01:20:02.298
Yeah, but that doesn't put you
on the list.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.473
But you're not even looking
at the list.

01:20:04.575 --> 01:20:05.974
'Cause I know you're not on it.

01:20:07.573 --> 01:20:10.343
Look, I'm sorry, you're right.
Anything we can work out?

01:20:10.445 --> 01:20:11.172
[sighs]

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.714
Hey, did you hear about Latte?

01:20:12.816 --> 01:20:14.882
No. You know something
about Latte?

01:20:14.985 --> 01:20:17.013
They're giving him a key
to the city. [chuckles]

01:20:17.115 --> 01:20:18.852
Some guys got all the luck, huh?

[crowd cheering and applauding]

01:20:33.498 --> 01:20:35.568
Now, don't try to get in
the City Hall with that.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:36.769
It's purely symbolic.

01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:38.468
- [chuckles]
- [crowd laughs]

01:20:39.476 --> 01:20:40.768
But all jokes aside,

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:44.445
I'd like to talk to you
in earnest about
running for office.

01:20:44.547 --> 01:20:46.113
Let's grab lunch, huh?

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:48.512
I've had a good run.

01:20:49.215 --> 01:20:51.184
But nobody wants
to be mayor forever.

01:20:53.021 --> 01:20:54.116
If you're not moving up
in this world,

01:20:54.218 --> 01:20:57.056
you're moving out, or over.

01:20:57.158 --> 01:20:59.357
[chuckles] Or whatever
the expression is.

01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:03.296
That's why I'm gonna take a run
at the Senate. [chuckles]

01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:06.230
Now, I'm gonna need somebody
to fill my shoes.

01:21:06.332 --> 01:21:09.001
Somebody who's gonna
endorse me, of course.

01:21:09.103 --> 01:21:11.903
And someone
who the people will love.

01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:14.776
And that's where you come in.

01:21:14.878 --> 01:21:17.340
Well, people love
a comeback story.

01:21:17.443 --> 01:21:20.145
If you can pretend to be
a person in the movies,

01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:22.479
you can pretend to be
a person in life.

01:21:22.581 --> 01:21:24.753
- [footsteps approaching]
- [woman] Sorry, I'm late.

01:21:24.855 --> 01:21:26.950
Did some quick polling.
They love him.

01:21:27.052 --> 01:21:28.484
They absolutely love him.

01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:30.452
- Ah.
- I've always been able
to pick a winner.

01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:33.958
Well, speaking of winners,
Latte, this is Terry.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.760
[Terry] We have a lot to do.

01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:37.263
His image is fine,

01:21:37.365 --> 01:21:39.294
but we have to figure out
what platform he'll run on.

01:21:39.396 --> 01:21:41.837
Oh, that's easy.
He's for the people.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.704
Well, every candidate
is for the people.

01:21:43.806 --> 01:21:45.136
That's why it works. [chuckles]

01:21:45.238 --> 01:21:48.002
No. The people
are ready for change.

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:50.438
How about, um...

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:54.409
Freeing America
from its corporate grip?

01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:57.047
He's the anti-big
business candidate.

01:21:57.149 --> 01:22:00.220
The-- the corporation killer.

01:22:01.986 --> 01:22:03.085
I like that.

01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:06.658
And, yes, he is for the fucking
people too, for Christ's sake.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.629
[both laughing]

01:22:08.731 --> 01:22:09.927
[quirky music playing]

01:22:10.029 --> 01:22:11.699
We'll be in touch, Latte.

01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:13.294
You're gonna be great, Latte.

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:15.136
But I'm gonna need this back.

01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:17.336
They're just for show.

01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:32.252
Get in.

01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:39.424
[suspenseful music playing]

01:22:55.976 --> 01:22:57.244
[elevator bell dings]

01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:04.482
[elevator bell dings]

01:23:10.793 --> 01:23:13.359
[elevator bell dinging]

01:23:19.099 --> 01:23:21.268
[dinging stops, door opens]

01:23:22.905 --> 01:23:25.140
[suspenseful music continues]

01:23:49.225 --> 01:23:52.433
[man groaning]

01:23:52.535 --> 01:23:57.031
[Ed] I'm afraid my brother
is under the weather,
Mr. Pronto.

01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:01.770
So, I will be speaking
on his behalf.

01:24:03.109 --> 01:24:05.477
You're a man of few words.

01:24:08.712 --> 01:24:12.517
It is very hard to trust
a man of few words.

01:24:13.484 --> 01:24:15.418
It is hard to know
where he stands.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.861
So when he is selected,
and believe me,

01:24:18.963 --> 01:24:21.559
all men in your position
are selected,

01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:26.295
it is very disconcerting
to discover that suddenly,

01:24:26.397 --> 01:24:28.731
he is a man with an agenda.

01:24:29.567 --> 01:24:33.269
He has traded in
his cape for a cause.

01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:36.908
He is a "corporation killer."

01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:38.741
"Anti-big business."

01:24:39.749 --> 01:24:42.646
He's for the people.

01:24:45.888 --> 01:24:47.750
Some dissent is good.

01:24:49.893 --> 01:24:52.293
You must allow some dissent.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.529
But is that what
"the people" want...

01:24:59.966 --> 01:25:01.368
Mr. Pronto?

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:06.804
What do you know
of the people, hmm?

01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:12.513
For the people
are bloodthirsty, Mr. Pronto.

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:17.918
They sit in the dark
and sip syrupy sodas

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.420
like the blood of their enemies

01:25:20.522 --> 01:25:25.554
while they watched
hyper-realized versions
of themselves

01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:29.829
kill and kill
and kill some more.

01:25:29.931 --> 01:25:31.827
And do you know why?

01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:36.502
Because it makes them forget.

01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:42.072
It makes them
stop asking questions.

01:25:42.607 --> 01:25:46.446
Because we want
to ask the questions.

01:25:47.079 --> 01:25:48.951
Such as...

01:25:49.053 --> 01:25:52.947
Who are you really,
Latte Pronto?

01:25:58.928 --> 01:26:00.328
Where do you come from?

01:26:02.899 --> 01:26:04.661
What do you want, really?

01:26:04.763 --> 01:26:08.298
Our little birdies
couldn't find a thing on you,

01:26:08.401 --> 01:26:11.504
and we find that
most disturbing.

01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:14.903
Most disturbing, indeed.

01:26:17.073 --> 01:26:22.076
However, I do not need
to know your true identity.

01:26:22.746 --> 01:26:25.350
I don't need to know
your past history

01:26:25.452 --> 01:26:28.383
to know what it is
that you really want,

01:26:28.485 --> 01:26:30.759
because it is what I want.

01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:33.261
It is what all men want.

01:26:33.363 --> 01:26:38.065
That is why we crave fame,
and power and money.

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:41.132
For what you want,
what I want,

01:26:41.234 --> 01:26:43.566
and what all men want

01:26:43.668 --> 01:26:48.974
is the unimpeded expulsion
of our jism!

01:26:49.076 --> 01:26:50.076
[Don Cote groaning]

01:26:50.178 --> 01:26:52.741
And when you seek to destroy

01:26:52.843 --> 01:26:56.711
another man's fame,
or wealth, or power,

01:26:56.813 --> 01:26:59.384
you seek to eliminate
the very tools

01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.787
he has amassed to ensure
that expulsion!

01:27:05.828 --> 01:27:06.858
[bangs table]

01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:10.029
My brother and I
will not be robbed

01:27:10.131 --> 01:27:12.527
of our ability to expel!

01:27:13.163 --> 01:27:18.571
We will not have the flow
of our natural desires
plugged up!

01:27:19.837 --> 01:27:23.675
Our fluid will not be forced
to retreat inward!

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.879
So help me God!

01:27:25.981 --> 01:27:27.943
[Don Cote yelling]

01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:31.582
[dramatic music plays]

01:27:31.684 --> 01:27:34.386
Latte! My man.
It's good to have you back!

01:27:34.488 --> 01:27:36.924
You're a hero.
Everybody loves a hero!

01:27:37.026 --> 01:27:38.627
Key to the city? Come on!

01:27:38.729 --> 01:27:39.820
And great news.

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:41.724
Despite being a colossal
critical failure,

01:27:41.826 --> 01:27:43.431
<i>Mosquito Boy</i>
did rather well overseas.

01:27:43.533 --> 01:27:46.131
I guess, uh, mosquitoes
are kind of a global irritant,

01:27:46.233 --> 01:27:47.266
so people could relate.

01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:48.662
I just feel like,
at this point,

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.038
you need someone
that gets you.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.969
"I get Latte."
You know?

01:27:53.071 --> 01:27:55.304
And the first step--
'cause you and I
are gonna do big things.

01:27:55.406 --> 01:27:59.380
So the first step for that
is you gotta cut the rest
of the team loose.

01:27:59.482 --> 01:28:03.282
Cut ties. You and me
are now doing big things.

01:28:03.384 --> 01:28:05.079
We are out there.
We are scared.

01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:07.882
We don't have a plan,
so we're thinking on our feet.

01:28:07.984 --> 01:28:10.291
We're on our backs,
thinking on our feet.

01:28:10.393 --> 01:28:12.259
We don't know what these
big opportunities are.

01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:13.889
We just know that
we have to get them.

01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:16.230
And that-- that's what's
so exciting about being--

01:28:16.332 --> 01:28:17.726
being a young performer
at this time.

01:28:17.828 --> 01:28:19.463
Like, Latte, we want
big things together.

01:28:19.565 --> 01:28:20.695
What are you doing
up there, bud?

01:28:20.797 --> 01:28:22.470
Bud, we want big things,
not this.

01:28:22.572 --> 01:28:25.206
Bud? Hey, excuse me, bud?
Bud, what are you doing, Latte?

01:28:25.308 --> 01:28:27.906
Latte! Can't have
you there! Latte!

01:28:28.008 --> 01:28:29.204
Latte!

01:28:29.306 --> 01:28:30.610
Latte!

01:28:31.276 --> 01:28:33.112
Latte! Latte!

01:28:33.214 --> 01:28:35.417
[emotional music playing]

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:03.038
[emotional music continues]

01:29:08.978 --> 01:29:11.217
[client]<i> Look, you gotta</i>
<i>take him back.</i>

01:29:11.319 --> 01:29:12.914
Come on, you know you love him.

01:29:13.017 --> 01:29:14.988
You know you need him.
He's got what it takes.

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:16.856
Give us another shot.

01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:18.056
Please.

01:29:18.726 --> 01:29:20.960
- I thought you didn't need me.
- Oh, but I do.

01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:25.366
I do. And I'm willing to change.
Big time, right?

01:29:25.468 --> 01:29:28.800
Yeah. I want
the Latte Pronto treatment.

01:29:33.508 --> 01:29:35.510
Latte Pronto...
[chuckles softly]

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.046
I don't know.

01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:41.043
Fame, fortune,
do they matter?

01:29:42.548 --> 01:29:44.518
You really wanna be somebody,

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:48.721
I'd say find someone
who really cares about you.

01:29:50.622 --> 01:29:52.021
That's what really matters.

01:29:53.592 --> 01:29:55.794
[emotional music continues]

01:29:58.869 --> 01:30:00.062
Jumpin' Jesus.

01:30:01.299 --> 01:30:02.364
Latte!

01:30:02.466 --> 01:30:03.837
Latte, wait!

01:30:03.939 --> 01:30:05.100
Latte!

01:30:06.437 --> 01:30:08.873
Latte! Latte!

01:30:10.078 --> 01:30:11.443
Latte, wait!

01:30:11.545 --> 01:30:14.175
[bright orchestral
music playing]

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:23.724
Latte!

01:30:23.826 --> 01:30:24.856
Latte!

01:30:26.026 --> 01:30:27.089
Latte.

01:30:28.457 --> 01:30:29.729
Latte.

01:30:31.196 --> 01:30:32.226
Latte.

01:30:33.902 --> 01:30:34.932
Latte.

01:30:43.074 --> 01:30:47.076
[panting] Latte, please.
Just let me say one thing.

01:30:47.743 --> 01:30:49.480
I'm sorry. [exhales]

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:51.979
I did you wrong.
I see that now.

01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:53.614
If there's something
you need to tell me,

01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:55.152
then just say it.

01:30:55.254 --> 01:30:56.821
Say it.

01:30:56.923 --> 01:31:00.362
I can handle it. I can change.
Just let me have it.

01:31:00.464 --> 01:31:02.795
Help me become
the better version of myself.

01:31:04.599 --> 01:31:08.003
Got it. Silent treatment.
That's fair.

01:31:08.105 --> 01:31:09.269
You probably hate my guts.

01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:11.265
But listen,
for what it's worth,

01:31:12.274 --> 01:31:13.938
I don't care about the work.

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.072
I just miss you.

01:31:17.277 --> 01:31:20.643
I just miss you.

01:31:20.745 --> 01:31:22.683
'Cause I really love you, pal.

01:31:23.315 --> 01:31:24.685
I mean it.

01:31:29.785 --> 01:31:31.956
I... love you too.

01:31:35.393 --> 01:31:36.631
Thank you.

01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:39.095
Thank you.

01:31:42.732 --> 01:31:44.971
Thank you. [sobs]

01:31:45.074 --> 01:31:46.102
Thank you.

01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:51.580
[laughing]

01:31:55.415 --> 01:31:56.981
What's this? For me?

01:31:59.451 --> 01:32:00.688
[chuckles]

01:32:03.858 --> 01:32:06.089
Is this for real, pal?
[chuckles] It's just...

01:32:08.729 --> 01:32:10.665
What am I looking
at here? Is this...

01:32:11.761 --> 01:32:14.566
Could be real. Yeah...

01:32:14.668 --> 01:32:16.704
It could be a bunch
of fool's gold.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.334
You know?

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:24.146
You know what?

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:25.977
Forget it. We got each other.

01:32:28.013 --> 01:32:30.619
You hungry? Come on,
let's grab a bite to eat.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.656
[soft music playing]

01:38:01.076 --> 01:38:02.577
[music ends]
