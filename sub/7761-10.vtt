[both moaning]

01:25.486 --> 01:29.557
- RELAX AND COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM TEN, MR. KINNEY.

02:07.928 --> 02:11.131
- [grunting]

02:25.813 --> 02:28.582
- BRIAN--
- DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.651
- LOOK, I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A TEMPORARY MALFUNCTION.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.254
IT TAKES TIME FOR YOUR BODY
TO HEAL ITSELF

02:33.287 --> 02:35.289
AND FOR YOU TO REGAIN
YOUR STRENGTH.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.790
BE PATIENT.

02:36.824 --> 02:40.461
EVERYTHING WILL BE UP
AND RUNNING IN NO TIME.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.565
- THANKS FOR NOT
SAYING ANYTHING.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.439
- I WANT TO GET
THOSE COOL PUMAS

02:51.472 --> 02:53.941
AND A PAIR OF DIESEL JEANS,
MAYBE TWO.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.409
- HEY, HEY.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.944
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
MADE OF MONEY?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.579
- LIKE, YEAH.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.414
YOU'RE HAVING A MOVIE MADE.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.949
- WE HOPE.
AND I DIDN'T WORK MY ASS OFF

03:01.982 --> 03:04.952
SO I COULD PUT EXPENSIVE JEANS
ON YOURS.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.321
- BEN, I WANT TO GET
A COUPLE PAIRS OF DIESEL JEANS.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.957
- PULL UP YOUR PANTS.
I CAN SEE YOUR SHORTS.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.592
- THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
- WE'RE TAKING HUNTER
TO BUY SOME NEW CLOTHES.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.995
- AND HAVE PIZZA AND GO
TO A MOVIE.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.765
- NOT A BRETT KELLER MOVIE.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.734
SO TOMORROW NIGHT?
THE MALL? THE THREE OF US?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.436
- UH, SURE. FINE.
[cell phone rings]

03:22.470 --> 03:24.338
AH, MUST BE MARK BLUESTEIN.
HE HAS THE FLU.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.240
I SAID I'D COVER HIS CLASS.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.509
HELLO?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.579
HEY.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.847
UH-HUH.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.849
SURE.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.386
UH, BREAKFAST, LUNCH,
WHATEVER.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.455
YEAH, SEE YOU THEN.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.856
- FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S LAID UP
WITH FLU,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.392
HE HAS
A PRETTY HEALTHY APPETITE.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.593
- OH, YEAH, THAT WASN'T MARK.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.860
IT WAS ANTHONY,
FROM THE LIBRARY.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.729
YOU REMEMBER,
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.631
- YEAH, HOW COULD I FORGET?
HE ONLY CALLS YOU EVERY HOUR.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.600
- [scoffs]
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.735
- MAYBE HE HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.737
HE'S JUST A NICE KID
WHO WANTS TO BE A WRITER.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.773
WE GET TOGETHER
AND DISCUSS BOOKS, THAT'S ALL.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.509
SO TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.345
PIZZA, MOVIE,
AND DIESEL JEANS.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.379
- TIGHT.

04:05.413 --> 04:09.016
- YEAH, YOU MEAN, "LOOSE."

04:09.049 --> 04:13.787
[both groaning]

04:30.103 --> 04:31.805
- OH, TOUCHDOWN!

04:31.839 --> 04:37.645
[laughing]

04:37.678 --> 04:41.649
MY, HOW THE BOY CAN SCORE.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.051
- I GOT A GOOD KICKER.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.919
- I'LL SAY.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.423
- THAT'S A QUARTERBACK'S
SECRET WEAPON.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.827
- SPEAKING OF SECRETS...

04:53.861 --> 04:55.396
DOES YOUR FIANCEE KNOW?

04:55.429 --> 04:57.398
- KNOW WHAT?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.533
- THAT YOU'RE...MM?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.402
- THAT I'M--

05:01.435 --> 05:03.437
- DO I REALLY HAVE TO SAY IT?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.406
THAT YOU'RE, UH, THE "H" WORD.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.575
- HARD-BODIED?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.810
HOT?
HUNG?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.545
YEAH, SHE KNOWS ALL THAT.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.447
- I MEANT, UH, HOMOSEXUAL.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.848
GAY. QUEER.

05:14.882 --> 05:18.419
- HEY, I'M NOT A FAG.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.454
- DID I USE THAT WORD?

05:20.488 --> 05:25.025
- A FAG IS
A SISSY, GIRL, A PANSY.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.094
YOU THINK I'M THAT?
- HARDLY.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.629
- A FAG CAN'T EVEN THROW
A BALL.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.963
DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR
I CAN THROW?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.433
- I RECKON A COUNTRY MILE.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.435
- I'M A HERO TO MILLIONS.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.003
NAME ONE FAG WHO'S A HERO.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.971
NAME ONE FAG WHO'S GOT A CALL
FROM THE PRESIDENT

05:38.005 --> 05:40.107
SAYING, "GREAT GAME."

05:40.140 --> 05:43.010
NAME ONE FAG THAT'S FUCKED
EVERY DALLAS CHEERLEADER,

05:43.043 --> 05:46.914
AND I DON'T EVEN PLAY
FOR DALLAS.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.050
NAME ONE FAG EVERY KID WANTS
TO GROW UP TO BE.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.920
- HARVEY FIERSTEIN?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.456
- SO WHY WOULD ANYONE THINK
I WAS A FAG?

05:55.489 --> 06:00.461
- MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAD
YOUR DICK UP MY ASS?

06:00.494 --> 06:02.930
- SO I LIKE TO FUCK GUYS.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.866
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I LOVE THEM
OR WANT TO KISS THEM

06:05.899 --> 06:08.869
OR EVEN KNOW THEM.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.540
THIS IS JUST FOR FUN.
TO GET OFF.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.609
AND NO ONE'S TO EVER HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.746
UNDERSTAND?

06:18.779 --> 06:22.950
- WHO'D BELIEVE ME
IF I TOLD THEM?

06:22.983 --> 06:27.421
- NEXT WEEK, AN ENORMOUS
250-FOOT MURAL OF YOURS

06:27.455 --> 06:29.557
WILL BE UNVEILED
AT PENN PLAZA.

06:29.590 --> 06:33.561
TOMORROW, AN EXHIBITION
OF YOUR DRAWINGS OPENS HERE,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.663
AT THE SIDNEY BLOOM GALLERY.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.431
TELL ME, MR. AUERBACH,

06:37.465 --> 06:39.099
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE PITTSBURGH?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.768
- WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE
A PIRATES FAN,

06:40.801 --> 06:43.036
THERE'S NOT A GODDAMN REASON
TO COME HERE.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.038
NOW THERE WILL BE.
- THAT'S PERFECT.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.708
- I'VE HEARD YOUR EGO
IS AS BIG AS YOUR MURAL.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.177
- I HOPE
I HAVEN'T LET YOU DOWN.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.446
I MEAN...I HOPE
THIS BAGEL-DEPRIVED BURG

06:52.480 --> 06:55.849
FEELS THE SAME WAY
WHEN THEY SEE MY WORK.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.118
- I THINK THAT'S ALL WE NEED.
THAT'S GOOD.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.988
THAT WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.824
- ANY TIME, HONEY.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.663
HOW WAS I?
- OKAY, I GUESS.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.199
I WASN'T REALLY LISTENING.
I WAS WORKING.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.067
- I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T DISTRACT YOU.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.205
- NOT AT ALL.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.474
- YOU KNOW...
[chuckles]

07:20.508 --> 07:25.078
I HAVE THIS STRANGE FEELING
THAT I'M BEING...IGNORED.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.680
STRANGE, BECAUSE, I MEAN,
LET'S--LET'S FACE IT,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.215
I'M NOT USED TO BEING IGNORED.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.951
IN FACT, I THINK THE LAST TIME
IT HAPPENED, I WAS 14.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.220
SUZIE SCHROEDER WAS HER NAME.
- OH.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.888
- SHE DITCHED ME
AT A TASTEE FREEZ

07:34.922 --> 07:38.759
FOR A GUY WITH A TRIPLE SCOOP.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.628
BROKE MY HEART.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
- WELL, YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.965
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO A TASTEE FREEZ IN YEARS.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.634
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER
AND FLIRT

07:46.667 --> 07:50.037
WITH THAT NICE GIRL REPORTER
AND LEAVE ME TO MY WORK?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.777
[phone rings]

07:56.810 --> 07:59.780
- HARVEY, WHEN HAVE I EVER
LET YOU DOWN?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.114
- ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.850
- NAME ONE TIME.
- THE TIME I ASKED YOU

08:02.883 --> 08:04.251
OUT ON A DATE, AND YOU SAID,
"THANKS, BUT NO."

08:04.284 --> 08:05.986
- OKAY, NAME A SECOND.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.921
- OH, JESUS, BRIAN, I WAS ONE
OF YOUR FIRST CLIENTS.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.590
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
A BIG SHOT NOW...

08:09.623 --> 08:12.259
[phone rings]
- HOLD ON.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
MR. DECARLO,
SORRY TO KEEP YOU.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.863
- WHEN IS THAT CAMPAIGN
GONNA BE READY?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.197
- WE'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.132
- HOW DOES IT LOOK?
- IT LOOKS GREAT.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.134
- I NEED IT FOR
THE NEXT STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.537
- WHEN?
- FRIDAY, 3:00,

08:23.571 --> 08:25.606
OR THEY'LL HAVE MY BALLS.
- HOLD ON.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.141
[beep]

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
TELL JACOB THAT IF THE ART
FOR DANDY LUBE

08:30.243 --> 08:32.212
ISN'T ON MY DESK
BY 9:00 A.M. FRIDAY,

08:32.245 --> 08:33.881
HE'LL BE TEACHING
REMEDIAL FINGER PAINTING

08:33.914 --> 08:37.217
TO KINDERGARTNERS.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.154
MR. DECARLO, HOW DOES 10:00 A.M.
FRIDAY SOUND?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.890
- STILL HAVE MY BALLS.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.758
[beep]

08:44.792 --> 08:46.760
[phone rings]

08:46.794 --> 08:48.629
- HARVEY, DID YOU THINK
OF A SECOND?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.764
- ACTUALLY, NO.
- SEE? I TOLD YOU.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.633
- LOOK, YOU OWE ME BIG, BRIAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED--

08:52.666 --> 08:55.168
- NOW STOP WORRYING,
I'LL GET YOU THE BACK COVER.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.105
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU,
HOT SHOT.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.674
- JEEZ, WITH AN ACT LIKE THAT,
YOU SHOULD BE IN VEGAS

09:00.708 --> 09:03.777
MAKING TIGERS VANISH
INTO THIN AIR.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.078
- THROW ME A BONE.

09:05.112 --> 09:09.116
I'M TRYING TO JUGGLE 15 BALLS
AT ONCE.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.918
NO REMARKS.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.319
THAT'S A NICE SUIT.

09:12.352 --> 09:18.058
- YEAH? WORKED WONDERS
ON SON OF DANDY LUBE.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.728
- YOU KNOW, I LIKE YOUR NEWFOUND
SELF-CONFIDENCE, THEODORE.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.130
FAR PREFERABLE
TO YOUR FORMER LACK THEREOF.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.599
- SO WHAT'S MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT,
JIM?

09:25.633 --> 09:27.000
- CONGRATS.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.136
BROWN ATHLETICS IS COMMITTING
A COOL MIL

09:29.169 --> 09:31.605
TO SNAG A MODEL
FOR THEIR NEW UNDERWEAR LINE.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.340
- WELL, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
I'M AVAILABLE.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.075
- UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

09:35.108 --> 09:36.209
WITH A HIGHER PROFILE.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.878
- NOT TO MENTION
A BIGGER BASKET.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.947
- THEY WANT
A FAMOUS SPORTS FIGURE.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.149
- I HAPPEN TO BE
PITTSBURGH'S 1986 JUNIOR CLASS

09:42.182 --> 09:43.684
PING-PONG CHAMPION.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.219
WELL, RUNNER-UP.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.355
- SO AT WHAT HOUR OF THE DAY
OR NIGHT

09:48.388 --> 09:51.358
AM I SUPPOSED TO CONDUCT
THIS STAR SEARCH?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.861
- I'LL DO IT FOR YOU, BRI.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.897
- YOU?
- YEAH.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.699
I LANDED DANDY LUBE,
DIDN'T I?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.268
LOOK, I'LL TALK TO SOME AGENTS,
A FEW MANAGERS,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.236
SEE WHO'S INTERESTED,
THEN PUT TOGETHER A SHORT LIST.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.404
FINAL DRAFT CHOICE,
OF COURSE, IS YOURS.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.839
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS PERFECT,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.274
EXCEPT FOR
ONE ITTY-BITTY DETAIL.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.710
YOU DON'T KNOW A FUCKING THING
ABOUT SPORTS.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.144
- BUT I KNOW ABOUT SEX,

10:11.178 --> 10:13.246
WHAT LOOKS GOOD
IN A PAIR OF SHORTS.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.282
AFTER ALL, I AM A GAY MAN,

10:15.315 --> 10:18.752
AND SEX IS
OUR NATIONAL PASTIME.

10:22.222 --> 10:26.193
- THESE DRAWINGS OF RAGE
AND JT ARE HOT.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.896
WHY CAN'T WE EVER SEE ZEPHYR
IN A FUCK-FEST

10:28.929 --> 10:30.731
WITH SOME GREAT-LOOKING GUY?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.767
- BECAUSE NOBODY BUYS OUR COMICS
TO SEE ZEPHYR GET LAID.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.135
- THAT IS SO NOT TRUE

10:35.168 --> 10:36.804
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE IT.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.272
- IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT
TO SEE IT.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.041
IT'S THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.409
- WELL, I CAN.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.011
WHEN HE AND HIS HUNKY BOYFRIEND,

10:44.044 --> 10:45.312
THE WORLD-FAMOUS PALEONTOLOGIST,

10:45.345 --> 10:47.014
PROFESSOR KEN KIRSCHNER,
GET IT ON,

10:47.047 --> 10:52.419
THEY REALLY RATTLE
THE OLD DINOSAUR BONES.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.788
EXCEPT EVER SINCE
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

10:54.822 --> 10:58.291
REJECTED THE PROFESSOR'S
LATEST RESEARCH FINDINGS,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.994
THEY HAVEN'T FELT MUCH LIKE
DOING IT.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.163
- I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.033
JT HASN'T GOTTEN A RISE
OUT OF RAGE

11:06.066 --> 11:10.938
SINCE ICE TEENA ZAPPED HIM
WITH HER RADIATION GUN.

11:10.971 --> 11:11.972
- YOU MEAN--

11:12.005 --> 11:14.441
- NOT SINCE THE OPERATION.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.243
- BUT I THOUGHT THE DOCTOR
SAID THAT...

11:16.276 --> 11:18.045
- NOTHING WOULD BE AFFECTED?

11:18.078 --> 11:22.482
YEAH, WELL, SOMETHING
SURE AS HELL ISN'T WORKING.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.384
- MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
SOME VIAGRA.

11:24.417 --> 11:28.455
- YOU TRY TELLING HIM THAT.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.058
- OKAY, SO HOW ABOUT WE TAKE
A LITTLE TRIP TO CHINATOWN?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.793
- I ALREADY ATE.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.828
- I MEANT TO SEE MASTER NEE.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.830
- WHO'S HE?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.465
- HE'S THIS HERBALIST
BEN SEES.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.333
HE SAYS HE'S A MIRACLE WORKER.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.802
HE GAVE HIM THIS STUFF
THAT ACTUALLY HELPED

11:41.835 --> 11:43.270
LOWER HIS VIRAL LOAD.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.205
- COME ON, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.208
- CHINESE MEDICINE'S BEEN
WORKING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.843
WHO AM I TO DOUBT IT?

11:49.877 --> 11:52.212
BESIDES, IF HE CAN HELP LOWER
BEN'S COUNT,

11:52.245 --> 11:55.816
MAYBE HE'LL BE ABLE TO RAISE...

11:55.849 --> 11:59.853
- THE TITANIC?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.388
- I GIVE THEM AN ASSIGNMENT

12:01.421 --> 12:03.423
TO CRITIQUE ONE
OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS' PLAYS,

12:03.456 --> 12:04.992
AND WHAT DO THEY DO?

12:05.025 --> 12:08.996
THEY RIP HIM TO SHREDS,
LIKE A PACK OF JACKALS.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.098
- OH, YOU KNOW
HOW SOME QUEERS ARE.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.432
THEY'RE NOT CONTENT
TO CRITICIZE,

12:12.465 --> 12:15.368
THEY HAVE TO SEEK AND DESTROY.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.506
- ALL I KNOW IS, IT'S A LOT
HARDER TO CREATE SOMETHING

12:19.539 --> 12:21.975
THAN IT IS TO TEAR IT APART.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.377
- LIKE YOUR BOOK.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.247
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
LIKE GIVING BIRTH.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.149
- MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.851
- I DO.

12:30.884 --> 12:35.522
EVERY SENTENCE I WRITE,
OR TRY TO, IS AGONY.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.424
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO IT.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.859
- PROBABLY FOR THE SAME REASON
I DO,

12:38.892 --> 12:40.994
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.130
IF YOU EVER WANT ME
TO READ ANYTHING,

12:43.163 --> 12:47.400
A STORY,
CHAPTER, SENTENCE...

12:47.434 --> 12:50.037
JUST ASK.
I PROMISE TO BE GENTLE.

12:50.070 --> 12:53.173
- I'M SURE YOU WOULD BE.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.044
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT EDMUND WHITE?

12:57.077 --> 13:00.447
- WHY, HIS ESSAYS AND ARTICLES
ON BEING POSITIVE

13:00.480 --> 13:02.883
INFLUENCED ME TREMENDOUSLY.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.019
BUT I PARTICULARLY LOVE
HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL FICTION.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.454
IN FACT, A BOY'S OWN STORY

13:07.487 --> 13:10.423
INSPIRED ME TO WRITE R-U-1-2.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.327
- THEN HOW ABOUT COMING WITH ME
TO HIS LECTURE TOMORROW NIGHT?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.163
I'VE GOT AN EXTRA TICKET.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.332
- YOU KNOW, I...I WOULD LOVE TO,

13:19.366 --> 13:21.068
BUT, UH, I ALREADY MADE PLANS

13:21.101 --> 13:23.570
WITH MY PARTNER
AND OUR FOSTER SON.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.338
- THAT TAKES PRIORITY.

13:25.372 --> 13:31.044
BUT IN CASE SOMETHING CHANGES,
I'LL SAVE YOU THE SEAT.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.246
- OKAY.

13:33.280 --> 13:38.251
[moaning]

13:55.635 --> 13:58.105
- HONEY?
- HMM?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.374
- THAT FEELS WONDERFUL.
- I'M GLAD.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.476
- BUT--BUT DO YOU MIND IF WE...

14:03.510 --> 14:05.578
- WHAT?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.086
- IF WE USE THIS?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.988
- GLINDA'S MAGIC WAND?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.958
WE HAVEN'T USED THIS SINCE
DOROTHY WENT HOME TO KANSAS.

14:17.991 --> 14:21.094
- I JUST FELT, I DON'T KNOW,
IN THE MOOD, I GUESS.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.495
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO--

14:22.529 --> 14:23.630
- NO, NO, NO,
IF IT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

14:23.663 --> 14:27.000
THEN LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL.

14:27.034 --> 14:31.871
[buzzing]

14:36.576 --> 14:38.912
- OH, GOD!

14:38.946 --> 14:42.983
[moaning]

14:43.016 --> 14:45.285
- THERE YOU GO.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.420
- THANKS.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.291
- TAKE IT EASY, DEB.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.626
- YEAH, YOU TOO, BETTY, HONEY.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

15:07.307 --> 15:11.178
- IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
I WAS IN THE DINER.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.580
- I NOTICED.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.450
- WALK YOU HOME?

15:17.484 --> 15:20.287
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.289
- IT'S LATE.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.458
- I'VE BEEN DOING IT ON MY OWN
FOR 20 YEARS.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.194
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

15:27.227 --> 15:31.031
- AND YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT HOOK
TO PROVE IT.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.601
[clears throat]

15:34.634 --> 15:36.703
- YOU'RE WORKING LATE.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.338
- JUST GOT TO GET THE JOB DONE.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.573
- USED TO BE THE ONLY REASON
YOU'D STAY UP

15:40.607 --> 15:43.576
WAS BECAUSE IT WAS STILL UP.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.046
- A LOT OF THINGS
"USED TO BE."

15:46.079 --> 15:48.081
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.254
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
WHAT I DID ABOUT VIC.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.598
- YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.335
NOT THAT YOU WERE WRONG.

16:08.368 --> 16:12.072
HE WAS LUCKY
HE GOT THOSE EXTRA YEARS.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.241
BUT IT'S THE WAY YOU SAID IT.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.776
JUST TOSSING IT OFF
LIKE IT DIDN'T MEAN A THING,

16:16.809 --> 16:19.979
LIKE HIS WHOLE FUCKING LIFE
DIDN'T MEAN A THING.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
- I SEE YOUR POINT.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.122
- YEAH, SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
SEE IT THEN?

16:32.825 --> 16:37.630
- MAYBE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I HAD CANCER THEN.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.633
- WHAT?

16:40.667 --> 16:44.003
- ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ME
SAY IT TWICE?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.174
- I JUST WANT TO BE SURE
THAT I HEARD--

16:47.207 --> 16:50.177
- YOU HEARD IT.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.580
- SHIT.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.784
ARE YOU OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT?

16:57.817 --> 17:00.553
THEY THINK.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.124
BUT WHO THE HELL KNOWS?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.458
- WELL, THEN WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING

17:05.492 --> 17:07.060
OUT AT 2:00
IN THE MORNING?

17:07.094 --> 17:09.696
YOU SHOULD BE HOME GETTING
YOUR REST, HONEY.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.798
- I CAN'T SLEEP.
I KEEP HAVING THESE DREAMS.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.666
- WELL, FORCE YOURSELF.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.702
AND MAKE SURE YOU EAT,
YOU HEAR ME?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.705
YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR STRENGTH UP.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.310
- YES, MOTHER.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.348
- DOES SHE KNOW?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.720
- SO FAR,
JUST MICHAEL AND JUSTIN.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.523
AND...THEODORE.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.160
- AND NOBODY TOLD ME?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.562
- I'M TELLING YOU.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.297
- HOW COME?

17:44.331 --> 17:48.768
- SO THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
AND TAKE PITY ON ME.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.208
- SON OF A BITCH.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.116
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY,
YOU HEAR ME?

18:06.653 --> 18:09.622
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.866
- HEY, I'M MAKING A LIST
FOR THE GROCERY.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.601
TIDE, BUTTER, OATMEAL.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.869
CAN YOU THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.738
- BATTERIES.
- HUH?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.674
- AFTER LAST NIGHT,
GLINDA'S MAGIC WAND'S

18:27.707 --> 18:28.908
GOING TO NEED RECHARGING.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.778
- OH.
- YOU WERE WILD, HONEY.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.246
- [chuckles]
MEL.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.514
- DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.816
IT WAS HOT TO SEE YOU
SO TURNED ON.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.651
- OKAY, WE'RE OUT OF FRUIT.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.220
PEARS, APPLES.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.754
SHOULD I GET MORE BANANAS?

18:41.788 --> 18:42.889
I MEAN...

18:42.922 --> 18:45.625
- I WOULD SAY SO.
- YEAH.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.360
- BY THE WAY,
I TALKED TO DUSTY,

18:47.394 --> 18:49.629
AND SHE SAID THAT WE
CAN DROP GUS OFF AROUND 4:00,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.231
WHICH GIVES US PLENTY OF TIME
TO GET READY

18:51.264 --> 18:52.232
AND GO TO THE OPENING.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.500
- CRANAPPLE JUICE...

18:53.533 --> 18:54.634
- DO YOU WANT TO GO TOGETHER,

18:54.667 --> 18:55.902
OR DO YOU
HAVE TO GET THERE EARLY?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.570
- I DON'T NEED TO BE THERE
AT ALL.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.905
- OH, SO YOU CAN BE A GUEST
JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.641
- I MEAN,
I'VE DECIDED NOT TO GO.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.276
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S YOUR SHOW.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.277
YOU PUT THE WHOLE THING
TOGETHER.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.645
- I KNOW.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.247
- WELL,
SO WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO--

19:07.280 --> 19:08.815
- I'VE SPENT ENOUGH TIME
ON IT ALREADY, OKAY?

19:08.848 --> 19:11.251
IT'S TIME I STARTED
BEING MORE ATTENTIVE TO YOU,

19:11.284 --> 19:12.552
TO OUR FAMILY.

19:12.585 --> 19:15.455
MICHAEL EVEN HAD TO GO
TO LAMAZE FOR ME.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.424
- HEY, HEY, HEY, WHEN I
FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GETTING

19:17.457 --> 19:19.792
ENOUGH ATTENTION,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.729
NOW, I WANT YOU TO GO
AND GET SOME OF THE ATTENTION

19:22.762 --> 19:24.864
YOU DESERVE.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.667
- WELL, MAYBE I'LL STOP BY
LATER, WHEN IT'S OVER,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.603
SEE HOW IT WENT.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.873
NOW...

19:33.906 --> 19:36.843
I'M OFF TO THE GROCERY.

19:38.478 --> 19:44.317
[indistinct chatter]

19:44.351 --> 19:45.952
- SINCE WHEN DID TED SCHMIDT,

19:45.985 --> 19:47.954
REIGNING OPERA QUEEN
OF PITTSBURGH,

19:47.987 --> 19:50.723
TRADE IN PUCCINI
FOR PIGSKIN?

19:50.757 --> 19:53.560
- SINCE I TOLD BRIAN I'D HELP
HIM FIND A FAMOUS SPORTS FIGURE

19:53.593 --> 19:55.562
TO MODEL BROWN ATHLETICS'
NEW UNDERWEAR LINE.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.564
- MMM, SOUNDS HOT.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.999
SO, UH, WHICH HUNKY JOCK
DID YOU SELECT

20:00.032 --> 20:02.435
TO DROP TROU AND SMILE
FOR THE BIRDIE?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.003
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO ANY OF THESE GUYS ARE.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
- OH, PERHAPS
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.907
- YOU?
[scoffs]

20:07.940 --> 20:09.609
LOOK, AT LEAST I KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE

20:09.642 --> 20:11.444
BETWEEN A FOOTBALL,
A BASEBALL, AND A BASKETBALL.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.347
- BALLS ARE BALLS.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.617
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

20:17.650 --> 20:21.388
- WHO?
- DREW BOYD.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.457
STAR QUARTERBACK

20:24.491 --> 20:26.859

62% PASS COMPLETIONS.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.029
THREW TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES
LAST GAME AND RAN FOR TWO.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031
LED ALL QUARTERBACKS
IN THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING YARDS.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.600
I MEAN, IF HE KEEPS PLAYING
THE WAY HE'S BEEN,

20:33.633 --> 20:34.767
HE'S A CINCH
TO LEAD HIS TEAM

20:34.801 --> 20:36.336
TO A CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP,

20:36.369 --> 20:39.772
THEN TO THE SUPER BOWL.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.343
WHAT?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.744
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT?

20:44.777 --> 20:47.480
- HMM, WELL,
LIFE'S FULL OF SURPRISES.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.615

20:48.648 --> 20:50.016
- HE'S ALSO GORGEOUS.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.884
LOOK AT THAT SMILE

20:51.918 --> 20:54.621
AND THOSE BROAD SHOULDERS

20:54.654 --> 20:57.824
AND THOSE BURLY, BURLY ARMS.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.392
[chuckles]
AND THAT ROCK-HARD BUTT.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.693
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.696
YOU'RE DROOLING
ALL OVER THE MAGAZINE.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.702
WELL, HE IS HOT.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.939
MM, TOO BAD HE'S STRAIGHT.

21:21.714 --> 21:29.689

21:54.747 --> 21:56.416

UH, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING TO...

21:58.918 --> 22:00.453

22:28.080 --> 22:31.851
- OH!

22:31.884 --> 22:32.985
COME TOO FAST?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.587
- UH, NO, IT'S NOT FOR ME.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.988
IT'S FOR MY FRIEND.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.466
EXHAUSTED CHANG MERIDIAN.

BUT NO WORRY.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.039
WE MAKE YOU HARD, LIKE ROCK.

IT'S FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.411
- IT'S FOR MY BOYFRIEND.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.079
HE HAD TO HAVE
A TESTICLE REMOVED,

23:00.112 --> 23:01.648

23:01.681 --> 23:04.617

29:35.908 --> 29:37.009
AND YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE MISSED IT.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.573
- YES, I'M SURE.
- WELL, I'M NOT.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.909
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT

30:09.942 --> 30:12.044
OF CONTRADICTORY FEELINGS
GOING ON HERE.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.913

30:36.668 --> 30:38.204
- AND IT ISN'T TRUE
WHAT YOU SAID.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.272
- LIAR, LIAR.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.974
- I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR YOU.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.844

OH, MY GOD!

31:43.369 --> 31:45.037

31:45.071 --> 31:46.572
AND TO THINK,
I NEVER WOULD'VE HEARD OF HIM

31:46.605 --> 31:48.707
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR YOUR CLASS.

31:48.740 --> 31:54.146
- OH, I'M SURE YOU WOULD'VE
DISCOVERED HIS WORK EVENTUALLY.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.282
- I THOUGHT THE PART
WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT...

31:56.315 --> 31:58.350
HOW BEING POSITIVE
CHANGED HIS LIFE

31:58.384 --> 32:00.619
WAS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL,
DIDN'T YOU?

32:00.652 --> 32:03.022
- HMM.
OH, I'D BETTER NOT.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.623
- AW, COME ON.

THE BOTTLE.

32:06.525 --> 32:10.062

32:10.096 --> 32:13.632
YOU KNOW, WHAT CONSTANTLY
IMPRESSES AND AMAZES ME,

32:13.665 --> 32:16.435
HOW WHEN CONFRONTED
WITH THE WORST OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

32:16.468 --> 32:20.106
WE, AS GAY MEN, SOMEHOW MANAGE
TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.575
- LIKE EDMUND WHITE.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.193
IF THIS IS WHERE ALL THIS
HAS BEEN LEADING,

32:41.227 --> 32:42.728
YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.631
- I DON'T THINK SO.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.069
- I HAVE A PARTNER.
WE HAVE A FOSTER KID.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.138
- I KNOW,
AND I'M NOT ASKING

32:52.171 --> 32:54.606
FOR ANYTHING I CAN'T HAVE.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.109
ALL I WANT...

32:59.178 --> 33:01.447
IS THIS.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.151
FROM THE MOMENT I SAW YOU,

33:05.184 --> 33:08.387
I FANTASIZED ABOUT YOU...

33:08.420 --> 33:10.389
ADMIRED YOU...

33:15.527 --> 33:18.464
WANTED TO BE LIKE YOU.

33:22.668 --> 33:27.139
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME THE GIFT.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.644
- WHAT?

33:32.678 --> 33:35.381
- I WANT YOU TO BE THE ONE.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.650
- ANTHONY--
- MAKE ME POSITIVE...

33:38.684 --> 33:40.119
LIKE YOU.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.387
- WHAT ARE YOU--STOP IT!

33:41.420 --> 33:43.122
- IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.391
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE IT DOES.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.393
- NOT IF YOU'RE SAFE.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.796
- WHY BE SAFE?

33:50.829 --> 33:54.733
ALL MY FRIENDS WHO'VE CONVERTED
SAY THEY FEEL LIBERATED.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.269
FREE.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.838
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.741
IT'S OVER.
DONE.

34:02.774 --> 34:07.213
I WANT TO BE LIKE THEM...

34:07.246 --> 34:09.315
LIKE YOU.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.289
- IT'S LATE.

34:17.323 --> 34:20.259
I HAVE TO GET HOME.

34:27.199 --> 34:31.069
[door opens, closes]

34:57.896 --> 34:59.331
- HERE.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.600
[groans]
DRINK THIS.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.535
- IT SMELLS LIKE YAK SHIT.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.605
- YEAH, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THAT WAS IN IT TOO.

35:06.638 --> 35:10.809
IT'S A MAGIC POTION
FROM A CHINESE HERBALIST.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.478
- WILL IT MAKE ME SMALL?

35:12.511 --> 35:14.213
- I'M HOPING...

35:14.246 --> 35:16.415
THAT IT WILL MAKE YOU LARGE.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.851
VERY, VERY LARGE.

35:35.267 --> 35:38.370
- [groans]

35:38.404 --> 35:39.638
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

35:39.671 --> 35:43.141
- WHO CARES?
AS LONG AS IT WORKS.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.280
- [sighs]

35:58.824 --> 36:01.760
- YOU FEELING ANYTHING?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.597
- WELL, IF YOU'RE EXPECTING
MY GLASSES TO STEAM UP,

36:05.631 --> 36:08.534
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.437
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO REKINDLE
THE FIRE IN YOUR LIFE GATE.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.472
- [scoffs]
MY LIFE GATE?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.674
- I KNOW
IT SOUNDS LUDICROUS, BUT...

36:15.707 --> 36:16.975
IF IT WORKS,
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.677
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE IT CAN ALSO STOP ME

36:18.710 --> 36:20.312
FROM THINKING
ABOUT WHAT'S NO LONGER THERE,

36:20.346 --> 36:23.349
AND THAT IN ITS PLACE
IS THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.486
OR FROM PICTURING THEM
SUCKING A BLOODY,

36:27.519 --> 36:31.757
DISEASE-RIDDEN BALL
OUT OF ME.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.292
OR FROM FEELING SO SHITTY

36:33.325 --> 36:34.760
FROM HAVING THEM
BURN ME TO A CRISP

36:34.793 --> 36:36.295
WITH THEIR RAY GUN
THAT ALL I WANT TO DO

36:36.328 --> 36:38.297
IS DIG A HOLE AND CRAWL IN,

36:38.330 --> 36:41.733
ONLY I'M TOO BUSY VOMITING.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.237
WHO KNOWS?

36:45.271 --> 36:48.840
MAYBE THEN I MIGHT EVEN
BE ABLE TO GET IT UP.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.244
- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.

36:52.278 --> 36:57.883
- WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S NOT A CUP OF LIPTON'S.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.551
- [sighs]

37:33.785 --> 37:36.822
- YOU'RE ALL WET.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.691
HOW WAS THE OPENING?

37:39.725 --> 37:41.427
- IT WAS PRACTICALLY SOLD OUT.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.695
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.631
CONGRATULATIONS.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.366
- THANKS.

37:47.399 --> 37:51.670
- AREN'T YOU GLAD
I MADE YOU GO?

38:06.084 --> 38:09.688
- AS YOU KNOW, I DON'T COME HERE
A HELL OF A LOT.

38:09.721 --> 38:10.789
I FIGURE YOU GOT ENOUGH
ON YOUR HANDS

38:10.822 --> 38:13.925
WITHOUT HEARING FROM ME.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.829
BUT, UM, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

38:19.631 --> 38:25.537
IT'S ABOUT MY BROTHER, VIC.
VIC GRASSI.

38:25.571 --> 38:30.342
HE'S GAY, WHICH SEEMS TO, UM,
BOTHER SOME OF THE PEOPLE

38:30.376 --> 38:32.944
YOU GOT WORKING FOR YOU.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.946
BUT I SAY--
[scoffs]

38:34.980 --> 38:36.882
CONSIDERING WHAT'S BEEN GOING
ON IN YOUR CHURCH LATELY,

38:36.915 --> 38:40.018
THEY GOT SOME HELL OF A NERVE
JUDGING OTHERS.

38:44.155 --> 38:48.827
I'M SURE YOU HAVE MORE LOVE
IN YOUR HEART THAN THEY DO...

38:48.860 --> 38:51.430
AND THAT THERE'S
A SPECIAL PLACE IN HEAVEN

38:51.463 --> 38:54.833
JUST FOR VIC.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.902
BUT, UH...

38:56.935 --> 39:01.640
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM,
JUST IN CASE.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.910
ONE MORE THING.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.613
BRIAN KINNEY.

39:07.646 --> 39:12.050
NO DOUBT
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.586
HE WOULDN'T LIKE ME
TELLING YOU THIS, BUT...

39:14.620 --> 39:19.725
THE BIGGEST ORGAN
HE'S GOT IS HIS HEART.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.994
SO PLEASE, GOD...

39:23.028 --> 39:26.064
MAKE HIM WELL.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.033
PLEASE.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.671
WELL...

39:32.704 --> 39:34.673
I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.743
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.645
AMEN.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.094
JOAN?

39:56.127 --> 39:57.763
IT'S DEBBIE.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.765
DEBBIE NOVOTNY.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.634
- HELLO, DEBBIE.

40:02.668 --> 40:05.771
I'M...
SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.206
- WELL, AS I WAS JUST SAYING,
I DON'T STOP BY TOO OFTEN.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.908
BUT WHEN THE GOING
GETS TOUGH,

40:09.941 --> 40:11.577
I STILL HAUL MY ASS
BACK HERE,

40:11.610 --> 40:14.580
YOU KNOW, LIKE
A GOOD LITTLE CATHOLIC GIRL.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.583
- WELL, THAT'S THE BLESSING
OF SUFFERING.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.785
IT BRINGS US CLOSER TO GOD.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.720
- WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.522
ANOTHER WAY IS TO SAY TO HIM,

40:23.555 --> 40:27.192
"COULD YOU CUT IT OUT ALREADY?"

40:27.225 --> 40:29.928
- I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S PASSING.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.797
PLEASE ACCEPT MY CONDOLENCES.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.565
- THANKS.

40:33.599 --> 40:37.135
- I REMEMBER
WHEN I LOST MY SISTER.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.606
I FELT LIKE I HAD...

40:40.639 --> 40:43.008
LOST MY BEST FRIEND,
MY CONFIDANTE...

40:43.041 --> 40:44.476
[chuckles]

40:44.510 --> 40:45.811
MY WITNESS.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.680
- THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP.

40:48.714 --> 40:51.550
- WELL, AT LEAST WE HAVE
OUR CHILDREN.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.619
THAT'S SOME COMFORT.

40:53.652 --> 40:57.489
PROVIDED THEY'RE TALKING
TO YOU.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.024
WELL...
[clears throat]

40:59.057 --> 41:02.160
GOD BLESS.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.897
- JOAN.

41:05.931 --> 41:08.967
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO BRIAN?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.638
- IT'S...BEEN A WHILE.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.906
- WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE HIM A CALL.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.744
- [scoffs] I DOUBT HE HAS
ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.013
- WELL, THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO HIM.

41:25.016 --> 41:25.984
[beep]

41:26.017 --> 41:27.152
- I GOT HIM.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.888
- GOT WHO?
- DREW BOYD.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.056
HE'S AGREED TO BE
THE NEW UNDERWEAR MODEL

41:31.089 --> 41:32.991
FOR BROWN ATHLETICS.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.259
- THAT'S WONDERFUL, TEDDY.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.762
- [laughs]
IT'S BEYOND WONDERFUL.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.630
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S ASTONISHING.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.299
IT'S...UNBELIEVABLE.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.001
- IT'S NOT THAT UNBELIEVABLE.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.036
AFTER ALL, THEY ARE PAYING HIM
A MILLION DOLLARS.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.605
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

41:46.638 --> 41:49.941
- UH, WELL, THEY ARE,
AREN'T THEY?

41:49.975 --> 41:52.678
- YEAH, BUT--
- WHY ARE YOU SO AMAZED?

41:52.711 --> 41:54.813
- NEVER MIND.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.783
- YOU KNOW, I-I ABSOLUTELY HATE
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.284
- DO WHAT?

41:59.317 --> 42:01.653
- START TO SAY SOMETHING
AND THEN SAY, "NEVER MIND."

42:01.687 --> 42:02.954
THEN I HAVE TO SPEND
THE NEXT TEN MINUTES

42:02.988 --> 42:04.289
BEGGING YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT IT IS.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.024
- I NEVER KNEW
IT IRRITATED YOU THAT MUCH.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.893
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
- WELL, WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO?

42:07.926 --> 42:10.028
YOU'D JUST GET HURT AND SULK.
- I WOULD NOT SULK.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.563
- AND THEN I'D HAVE TO SPEND
ANOTHER TEN MINUTES

42:11.597 --> 42:13.064
CONVINCING YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU

42:13.098 --> 42:14.766
AND BEGGING YOU TO FORGIVE ME,
WHICH YOU FINALLY WOULD.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.635
SO WILL YOU PLEASE JUST TELL ME
WHAT THE FUCK IT IS,

42:16.668 --> 42:20.238
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE ENTIRE SONG AND DANCE?

42:20.271 --> 42:24.042
- I FORGOT WHAT IT IS
I WASN'T GOING TO TELL YOU.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.345
- YOU WEREN'T GOING TO TELL ME
WHY IT IS SO UNBELIEVABLE

42:27.378 --> 42:31.049
THAT DREWSIE--
D-DREW BOYD SAID YES.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.652
- UH, RIGHT.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.254
BECAUSE I WAS SURE
THAT HE WOULD SAY NO.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.989
THAT HE WOULD
TURN ME DOWN FLAT,

42:38.023 --> 42:39.725
AND THEN I'D HAVE
TO FACE BRIAN'S WRATH

42:39.758 --> 42:41.192
FOR BEING
A WRETCHED FAILURE.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.062
- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
HE SAID YES.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.798
- AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

42:46.832 --> 42:48.667
- ME? WH--

42:48.700 --> 42:50.201
- WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SUGGESTED HIM, AREN'T YOU?

42:50.235 --> 42:53.705
- OH, YEAH, HMM,
I SUPPOSE I DID.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.206
- ALTHOUGH...

42:55.240 --> 42:57.843
I MUST'VE BEEN
PRETTY DAMN IMPRESSIVE

42:57.876 --> 43:01.613
TO CONVINCE A BIG-TIME JOCK
LIKE DREW BOYD

43:01.647 --> 43:05.050
TO STAND AROUND
IN HIS SHORTS.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.955
HUH.

43:09.988 --> 43:12.624
- THERE YOU GO.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.361
PROFESSOR BRUCKNER.
- I'D LIKE TO CHECK THESE OUT.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.096
- CERTAINLY.
- ANTHONY--

43:18.129 --> 43:20.899
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT, BEN.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.001
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU
IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

43:23.034 --> 43:25.771
- IT WASN'T SO MUCH AWKWARD
AS IT WAS UPSETTING

43:25.804 --> 43:27.105
TO LEARN
THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED

43:27.138 --> 43:30.108
WAS FOR ME TO GIVE YOU
"THE GIFT."

43:30.141 --> 43:33.044
- YOU WERE AND STILL ARE
MY INSPIRATION.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.113
- THEN LISTEN TO ME.

43:35.146 --> 43:37.716
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
IT'S REALLY LIKE TO BE POSITIVE.

43:37.749 --> 43:41.386
NO BOOK, NO LECTURE
COULD EVER DESCRIBE THAT.

43:41.419 --> 43:44.322
SO PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN
I TELL YOU YOU DON'T WANT IT.

43:44.355 --> 43:46.391
YOU DON'T.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.994
- WELL, THANKS FOR TRYING
TO TALK ME OUT OF IT,

43:49.027 --> 43:51.129
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

43:51.162 --> 43:53.064
YOU SEE, I WENT
TO A PARTY LAST NIGHT.

43:53.098 --> 43:55.033
- WHAT KIND OF PARTY?

43:55.066 --> 43:57.002
- IT'S CALLED
A CONVERSION PARTY.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.738
I HAD UNPROTECTED SEX
WITH A DOZEN OR SO GUYS.

43:59.771 --> 44:02.140
IT'S NOT THE WAY
I WOULD'VE PREFERRED IT,

44:02.173 --> 44:05.143
BUT HOPEFULLY,
IT WORKED.

44:05.176 --> 44:06.878
- OH, ANTHONY,
FOR GOD'S SAKE...

44:06.912 --> 44:11.016
- THEY SAID I SHOULD KNOW
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

44:11.049 --> 44:14.185
THE SAME TIME THESE BOOKS
ARE DUE BACK.

44:23.829 --> 44:25.296
- HEY.

44:25.330 --> 44:30.035
- YOUR NEW OFFICE
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

44:30.068 --> 44:34.305
AND I LIKE THE NAME,
KINNETIK WITH TWO "N"s.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.943
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.814
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

44:44.750 --> 44:47.418
- WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.257
- I SAW THAT...

44:52.290 --> 44:55.193
DEBBIE NOVOTNY
IN CHURCH THIS MORNING.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.795
- WELL, WHAT THE HELL
WAS SHE DOING THERE?

44:56.828 --> 45:00.799
- WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO,
PRAY.

45:00.832 --> 45:03.869
[chuckles]
SHE'S QUITE A CHARACTER.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.937
- YEAH, WELL,
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

45:05.971 --> 45:08.406
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW HER POOR SON EVER SURVIVED.

45:08.439 --> 45:11.843
- MAYBE BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM.

45:17.182 --> 45:21.086
- AND I LOVE YOU.

45:21.119 --> 45:25.156
WELL, YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THAT,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

45:25.190 --> 45:29.294
THAT'S WHY IT HURT SO MUCH
THAT I HAD TO HEAR IT FROM HER

45:29.327 --> 45:33.298
AND NOT FROM YOU.

45:33.331 --> 45:36.902
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

45:36.935 --> 45:38.436
- THE REASON BEING?

45:38.469 --> 45:40.171
- SO I COULD HELP YOU.

45:40.205 --> 45:43.842
- WELL, I'M A BIG BOY, MOM.
I CAN DRESS MYSELF.

45:43.875 --> 45:47.846
- I MEANT PRAY FOR YOU.
HELP YOU TO SEE GOD'S PLAN.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.848
- [chuckles]
GOD HAS A PLAN?

45:49.881 --> 45:53.384
- HE SPARED YOU FOR A REASON.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

45:53.418 --> 45:56.387
- TO TORMENT YOU.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.189
I MEAN, NO MARTYR
WAS EVER SAINTED

45:58.223 --> 46:01.392
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A SHITLOAD
OF PAIN AND SUFFERING.

46:01.426 --> 46:06.865
WELL, SAINT JOAN,
SAY HELLO TO YOUR SHITLOAD.

46:06.898 --> 46:09.134
- BRIAN.

46:09.167 --> 46:13.939
WHATEVER ANGER,
WHATEVER HATRED YOU HAVE FOR ME,

46:13.972 --> 46:15.807
YOU'RE STILL MY SON,

46:15.841 --> 46:18.209
AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING
TO SAVE YOU

46:18.243 --> 46:20.211
FROM THE ETERNAL FIRE.

46:20.245 --> 46:22.280
EVERY TIME YOU ENGAGE
IN BEHAVIOR

46:22.313 --> 46:25.416
THAT THE BIBLE EXPRESSEDLY SAYS
IS AN ABOMINATION,

46:25.450 --> 46:29.054
YOU'RE ADDING ANOTHER ETERNITY
TO YOUR SENTENCE.

46:29.087 --> 46:30.922
- WELL, I WISH
I WAS ENGAGING IN IT.

46:30.956 --> 46:32.590
- IT BRINGS TEARS
TO JESUS' EYES,

46:32.623 --> 46:35.026
KNOWING THAT YOU'VE SINNED.

46:35.060 --> 46:39.464
BUT ONLY YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF
FROM GOD'S PUNISHMENT.

46:39.497 --> 46:45.070
- YOU THINK GOD GAVE ME CANCER
TO PUNISH ME?

46:48.606 --> 46:50.241
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

46:50.275 --> 46:51.977
YOU CAN STILL CHANGE.

46:52.010 --> 46:55.246
I KNOW YOU CAN.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.048
- I CAN?

46:57.082 --> 46:59.117
- THOUGH IT WON'T BE EASY.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.920
YOU'LL HAVE
TO FIGHT TEMPTATION.

47:01.953 --> 47:04.189
BE STRONG.
HARDEN YOURSELF.

47:04.222 --> 47:06.257
- I WANT TO BE HARD, MOM.

47:06.291 --> 47:12.130
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I WANT TO BE HARD.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.332
OH, LORD, MAKE ME HARD,

47:14.365 --> 47:20.205
SO THAT I CAN FUCK
EVERY HOT GUY I SEE!

47:20.238 --> 47:23.008
THAT'S WHY GOD
GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE, MOM,

47:23.041 --> 47:25.076
SO THAT I CAN USE
THE ONE BALL I HAVE LEFT.

47:25.110 --> 47:27.946
- SHAME!

47:27.979 --> 47:29.647
SHAME ON YOU!

47:29.680 --> 47:31.149
- AND IF I HAVE TO SPEND

47:31.182 --> 47:33.551
AN ETERNITY OF ETERNITIES
BURNING IN HELL,

47:33.584 --> 47:35.353
IT'S BETTER
THAN SPENDING ONE GOOD DAY

47:35.386 --> 47:38.990
IN HEAVEN WITH YOU!

48:03.148 --> 48:05.483
[sighs]

48:08.186 --> 48:10.555
THANK YOU.

48:12.357 --> 48:16.027
- SO IN THIS DREAM,
THERE'S THIS GIGANTIC BILLBOARD

48:16.061 --> 48:19.998
OF YOU, TIMES SQUARE,
LIKE, 40 STORIES HIGH,

48:20.031 --> 48:22.300
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.402
- MY AGENT
SAID IT'D BE GREAT EXPOSURE.

48:24.435 --> 48:26.037
- [chuckles]

48:26.071 --> 48:28.539
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW
I HAVE THIS, UM,

48:28.573 --> 48:31.409
LITTLE ECCENTRICITY
ABOUT SIZE,

48:31.442 --> 48:34.012
AND YOUR CROTCH
GOES FROM, LIKE,

48:34.045 --> 48:38.183
THE 16TH TO THE 23RD FLOOR.

48:38.216 --> 48:41.286
SO I GET ON THIS SCAFFOLDING
THAT CONVENIENTLY HAPPENS

48:41.319 --> 48:43.154
TO BE THERE,
PULL MYSELF UP,

48:43.188 --> 48:48.026
AND THE AMAZING THING IS,
THE BILLBOARD COMES TO LIFE.

48:48.059 --> 48:52.297
SO I LEAP OUT ONTO YOUR SHORTS,
PULL THEM DOWN,

48:52.330 --> 48:55.466
AND YOU HAVE
THIS HUMONGOUS BONER

48:55.500 --> 48:59.170
THAT EXTENDS HALFWAY
ACROSS TIMES SQUARE.

48:59.204 --> 49:01.606
SO I CLIMB OUT ONTO IT
TO GIVE YOU A BLOW JOB,

49:01.639 --> 49:05.043
AND I'M HANGING OFF IT--
AHHH--DOING MY THING,

49:05.076 --> 49:08.213
WHEN SUDDENLY,
YOU SHOOT.

49:08.246 --> 49:11.582
OKAY, IT IS LIKE
THIS EXPLODING CASCADE,

49:11.616 --> 49:14.752
AND I RIDE IT...

49:14.785 --> 49:16.721
AND LAND, SAFELY,

49:16.754 --> 49:19.190
IN FRONT
OF THE WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,

49:19.224 --> 49:22.227
WHERE MAMMA MIA!
IS PLAYING.

49:22.260 --> 49:24.062
[chuckles]

49:24.095 --> 49:26.731
- YOU'RE A VERY WEIRD GUY.

49:26.764 --> 49:29.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK IT MEANS?

49:29.500 --> 49:31.736
FOR ONE THING, YOU'RE
A BIGGER-THAN-LIFE PERSON.

49:31.769 --> 49:33.204
- GOT IT.

49:33.238 --> 49:36.241
- AND I GUESS
I'M AFRAID THAT...

49:36.274 --> 49:38.609
ONCE THE REST OF THE WORLD
SEES YOU,

49:38.643 --> 49:43.548
I'LL BE JUST ANOTHER FACE
IN THE CROWD.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.392
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

49:54.425 --> 49:58.129
- 'CAUSE I WANTED TO.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.100
[In Your Presence playing]

50:02.133 --> 50:05.536
- * IN YOUR PRESENCE

50:05.570 --> 50:08.806
* THERE IS LIFE

50:08.839 --> 50:10.375
- HEY!

50:10.408 --> 50:12.510
MM!

50:12.543 --> 50:14.245
WHAT'S UP?

50:14.279 --> 50:17.782
- IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

50:17.815 --> 50:19.250
- WHOA!

50:19.284 --> 50:21.652
- IS THAT A THING OF BEAUTY?

50:21.686 --> 50:24.789
- [grunts]
AND A JOY FOREVER.

50:24.822 --> 50:30.328
*

50:30.361 --> 50:35.200
[moaning]

50:35.233 --> 50:39.570
*

50:39.604 --> 50:42.807
SO THAT HAPPY-TIME TEA
ACTUALLY WORKED?

50:42.840 --> 50:46.177
- MMM, UNLIKELY.

50:46.211 --> 50:50.148
- THEN WHENCE THE WOODY?

50:50.181 --> 50:54.719
- LET'S JUST SAY THAT GOD
GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE.

50:56.187 --> 50:58.289
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW IT.

50:58.323 --> 51:01.692
BUT...
YOU FEEL FREE TO.

51:01.726 --> 51:05.363
- * IN YOUR PRESENCE

51:05.396 --> 51:07.398
* THERE IS LIFE

51:45.636 --> 51:47.272
- WELL?

51:47.305 --> 51:51.276
- YOU SURE YOU WANT MY OPINION
AFTER THE LAST TIME?

51:51.309 --> 51:52.677
- YEAH, I WOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED YOU TO READ IT

51:52.710 --> 51:55.646
IF I DIDN'T.

51:56.814 --> 51:59.250
- OKAY, UM...

51:59.284 --> 52:03.921
MY HONEST OPINION IS...

52:03.954 --> 52:07.525
IT'S BRILLIANT.

52:07.558 --> 52:09.894
I MEAN IT.
- [exhales]

52:09.927 --> 52:12.430
- AT FIRST, I WAS SHOCKED
AND EVEN DISGUSTED

52:12.463 --> 52:15.366
THAT ANYONE WOULD
ACTUALLY WANT TO BE POSITIVE.

52:15.400 --> 52:16.934
BUT SOMEHOW, BY THE END,

52:16.967 --> 52:20.805
I-I REALLY FELT SORRY
FOR THE GUY...

52:20.838 --> 52:23.941
THAT HE COULD BE
THAT LOST...

52:23.974 --> 52:26.344
AND ALONE.

52:30.848 --> 52:34.552
AND IT TAKES
A PRETTY AMAZING WRITER...

52:34.585 --> 52:37.688
TO BE ABLE
TO PULL THAT OFF.

52:40.325 --> 52:43.294
- [chuckles]

53:05.650 --> 53:06.951
SO HOW WAS THE TRIP
TO THE MALL?

53:06.984 --> 53:09.820
[both chuckling]

53:09.854 --> 53:12.890
- I SPLURGED.
I BOUGHT HUNTER HIS JEANS.

53:12.923 --> 53:14.425
- [groans]

53:14.459 --> 53:17.728
- AND HE GOT US SOMETHING,
A CD.

53:17.762 --> 53:19.430
- UH, NOT SOME RAP CRAP.

53:19.464 --> 53:20.998
- NOW, NOW, DEAR.

53:21.031 --> 53:23.468
MUSTN'T CRITICIZE
THE YOUNGER GENERATION'S MUSIC.

53:23.501 --> 53:26.437
- [scoffs]
YEAH.

53:26.471 --> 53:29.440
[Keep the Flame playing]

53:29.474 --> 53:30.575
*

53:30.608 --> 53:32.443
[laughs]

53:32.477 --> 53:34.612
OH, MY--

53:34.645 --> 53:36.747
NOT BAD.

53:36.781 --> 53:39.317
- COME ON, YOU BIG LUG,
WALTZ ME AROUND THE ROOM.

53:39.350 --> 53:42.320
- HMM.

53:42.353 --> 53:44.755
*

53:44.789 --> 53:48.726
- * I JUST CAN'T TELL MYSELF
NOT TO LOVE YOU *

53:48.759 --> 53:50.795
- [laughing]

53:50.828 --> 53:56.767
- * ANY MORE THAN I CAN STOP
MY BEATING HEART *

53:56.801 --> 53:59.404
* EVERY MOMENT I'M AWAKE

53:59.437 --> 54:02.773
* I'M THINKING OF YOU

54:02.807 --> 54:07.378
* AND HOPING
THAT WE'LL NEVER BE APART *

54:07.412 --> 54:08.879
*

54:08.913 --> 54:14.619
* I COULD SAY,
TIME TO GIVE UP THIS FIGHT *

54:14.652 --> 54:16.354
* SURRENDER
TO WHAT'S GONNA BE *

54:16.387 --> 54:18.923
- YOU KNOW WHAT PART
OF YOUR STORY I LIKED BEST?

54:18.956 --> 54:22.493
- HMM?

54:22.527 --> 54:24.662
WHAT?

54:24.695 --> 54:27.064
- THE PART
WHERE THE GIFT-GIVER

54:27.097 --> 54:31.669
DECIDES NOT TO SLEEP
WITH THE BUG-CHASER...

54:31.702 --> 54:34.372
AND GOES BACK
TO HIS PARTNER.

54:34.405 --> 54:39.076
- * AND SO I KEEP THE FAITH
TO BELIEVE LOVE CAN BE TRUE *

54:39.109 --> 54:44.849
* WE MAY TRY TO RUN AWAY,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO *

54:44.882 --> 54:47.918
* IF IT'S MEANT TO BE

54:47.952 --> 54:52.923
* THEN THERE'S
ONLY ME AND YOU *

54:52.957 --> 54:57.428
*

54:57.462 --> 55:02.933
* I'LL ALWAYS KEEP THE FLAME

55:02.967 --> 55:08.873
* HOPING YOU FEEL THE SAME

55:08.906 --> 55:13.344
* WHEN I WHISPER YOUR NAME

55:13.378 --> 55:19.350
* IT'S BECAUSE
I'M THINKING OF YOU *

55:19.384 --> 55:21.419
*

55:21.452 --> 55:26.957
* BABY, MY LOVE IS PURE

55:26.991 --> 55:31.095
* I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE SURE

55:31.128 --> 55:33.864
*

55:33.898 --> 55:37.101
* WITHOUT SHAME

55:37.134 --> 55:40.104
* I NOW PROCLAIM

55:40.137 --> 55:44.509
* I WILL ALWAYS

55:44.542 --> 55:50.381
* ALWAYS KEEP THE FLAME

55:50.415 --> 55:58.355
*

56:08.699 --> 56:14.539
* SO MANY ARE DOUBTFUL
AND DESPAIRING *

56:14.572 --> 56:18.943
* MAKING FUN OF THOSE
WHO DARE TO DREAM *

56:18.976 --> 56:20.878
*

56:20.911 --> 56:25.182
* THEY SAY THEY'RE PAST
THE POINT OF EVER CARING *

56:25.215 --> 56:27.017
*

56:27.051 --> 56:32.890
* BUT I KNOW IT'S
NOT AS DARK AS IT MAY SEEM *

56:32.923 --> 56:38.896
* AT THE MOMENT
TROUBLE TRIES TO FIND US *

56:38.929 --> 56:43.768
* AND WE BRACE
AGAINST THE FIERCEST STORM *

56:43.801 --> 56:45.169
*

56:45.202 --> 56:51.041
* IT ONLY TAKES
A TINY SPARK OF KINDNESS *

56:51.075 --> 56:55.713
* TO START A BLAZING FIRE
TO KEEP US WARM *

56:55.746 --> 57:01.185
* I'LL ALWAYS KEEP THE FLAME

57:01.218 --> 57:05.055
* HOPING YOU FEEL THE SAME

57:05.089 --> 57:07.558
*

57:07.592 --> 57:09.594
* WHEN I WHISPER YOUR NAME
