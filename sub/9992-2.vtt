WEBVTT

00:06.560 --> 00:08.330
I have a theory.alma

00:08.360 --> 00:09.560
We all eat.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.260
We all sleep.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.530
We all dream.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.530
WOMAN:
Manuel?

00:23.900 --> 00:24.860
Can you hear me?

00:27.580 --> 00:30.880
Manuel wake up
Huh?

00:31.910 --> 00:34.080
What?
What are you doing?

00:34.110 --> 00:37.910
What, what, what are...
what are you talking about?

00:37.950 --> 00:41.350
Geez, Manny,
are you all right?

00:41.380 --> 00:43.980
What do you mean?

00:44.010 --> 00:45.950
You wet the bed.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.910
Our dreams reveal us
to ourselves.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.050
The people we are.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.650
Don't just shoot,
you gotta aim it.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.810
So when that site is in
the middle of the clown's mouth,

00:59.850 --> 01:02.250
then you shoot.
Okay, Daddy.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.980
The people we'd like to be.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.350
Whoo! Yeah!

01:07.380 --> 01:09.180
You don't need much.

01:09.210 --> 01:11.350
Just a little push.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.850
Oh, hole in two!

01:14.880 --> 01:15.880
Hey!

01:15.910 --> 01:17.510
Ah, come on, boy!

01:20.780 --> 01:22.110
You guys have fun?

01:22.150 --> 01:24.010
Oh... sure did.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.010
(grunting):
All right.

01:29.410 --> 01:30.610
Here's your deposit.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.080
A lot of people tell me
the game's even more fun

01:33.110 --> 01:35.250
when they bring their own kid,
rather than renting one.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.210
I know. I heard that.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.410
You know how
to get one?

01:39.450 --> 01:41.250
I know people.

01:49.750 --> 01:50.980
(grunting):
Yeah.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.150
(sighing):
Wait a second, will you?

01:57.180 --> 01:58.680
What are you talking about--

01:58.710 --> 02:00.110
"heads blown off"?

02:05.080 --> 02:07.080
Mm... do me a favor,
look around.

02:07.110 --> 02:11.150
Sometimes... a kid will hide
under the bed, in a closet.

02:13.780 --> 02:15.150
All dead.

02:15.180 --> 02:19.750
No, I have no idea
where the mayor is.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.050
It's 5:52 in the morning.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.580
I'm guessing
that he's at home, asleep.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.650
Wait a second,
give me an address.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.680
How many children?

02:32.050 --> 02:34.350
No, don't move anything,
just lock it down.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.110
I'm maybe 35 minutes away.

02:36.150 --> 02:38.550
I'll be right down there.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.110
Some people have dreams
that amaze them...

02:51.280 --> 02:52.450
...and entertain them.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:28.080 --> 03:31.010
And then there are my dreams.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.770
Where is your head?

03:37.820 --> 03:42.620
You keep staring at the ceiling
like your mind is somewhere else.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.760
Like your mind is on someone else.

03:48.930 --> 03:56.130
It's rude to pay a woman for her attention

03:56.820 --> 03:58.320
and then not give her any.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.640
MAN:
Speak English.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.010
You want English?

04:06.040 --> 04:08.640
Why'd you come to Indonesia?

04:08.670 --> 04:09.940
Go home to America.

04:13.910 --> 04:15.310
Where are you going?

04:15.340 --> 04:16.440
I'm going
to the airport.

04:16.470 --> 04:17.839
I'm going home.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.769
(scoffs)
I feel
like going home.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.769
You can't do that.

04:21.810 --> 04:24.910
You're intoxicated.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.170
Do you even have a ticket?

04:28.340 --> 04:32.740
Besides...
it's early in the morning.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.770
It's not time for traveling.

04:35.810 --> 04:39.640
It's time to make love.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.340
Keep the change.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.370
What's the matter?

05:20.410 --> 05:22.040
What's going on?

05:22.070 --> 05:24.770
A dream?
Ugh, yeah.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.340
You want to talk
about it?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.670
I don't know.

05:30.710 --> 05:35.010
I'm not sure there's anything
to talk about.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.740
Oh, wow.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.310
Well, that's a first.

05:41.910 --> 05:46.140
I mean,
it took place in Indonesia.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.810
I don't know anyone
in Indonesia.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.540
You would've
liked it, though.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.410
There was a naked
girl in it.

05:58.970 --> 06:01.340
This is weird.

06:01.370 --> 06:03.140
I just had the
exact same dream.

06:03.170 --> 06:05.240
Oh, really.

06:05.270 --> 06:06.570
Truly.

06:06.610 --> 06:11.740
Was there a guy in your dream
who got his head chopped off?

06:11.770 --> 06:13.570
No.

06:13.610 --> 06:15.510
I just had the
naked girl part.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.740
I see.

06:17.770 --> 06:19.210
You had a guy...

06:23.610 --> 06:26.170
Well, I hope you're happy.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.940
Now I'm afraid to
go back to sleep

06:27.970 --> 06:29.110
and finish the dream.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.870
Yeah, well,
welcome to my world.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.970
BRIDGETTE:
I have a sore throat.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.610
What are you
talking about?

07:24.640 --> 07:26.510
Don't make me
say it again.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.940
It really hurts.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.070
Come here, Bridge.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.970
Let's have a
look at you.
No, don't, Daddy.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.910
(giggling loudly):
Hey, hey!

07:41.940 --> 07:43.370
Oh, what do you know?

07:43.410 --> 07:44.940
All cured.

07:44.970 --> 07:46.210
No, wait.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.640
That was my tickle throat,
not my talking throat.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.070
(chuckles)
Well, you can use

07:51.110 --> 07:52.340
your tickle throat
in school today.

07:52.370 --> 07:54.340
No one will know
the difference.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.510
Bridge...
Hmm?

07:56.540 --> 07:59.640
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

07:59.670 --> 08:01.370
No, you'll just
think it's stupid.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.670
Well, maybe, maybe not.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.510
Well, I had the funnest
dream last night,

08:07.540 --> 08:08.870
and I was sort of hoping

08:08.910 --> 08:11.510
that I could stay in bed
and have it again today.

08:11.540 --> 08:12.870
What kind of dream?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.870
It was a cartoon
with monkeys in it.

08:18.370 --> 08:19.410
BRIDGETTE:
Oh, no.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.210
Hello?

08:23.240 --> 08:25.070
If I swing by your house
in 20 minutes,

08:25.110 --> 08:27.910
could you join me for a
little trip to Paradise Valley?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.410
Uh, hang on a second.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.110
I have to ask my husband if he
can run the girls to school.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.909
Yes, I can run the
girls to school.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.710
And don't worry, Bridge,
if you start feeling

08:36.740 --> 08:39.659
a little feverish, I'll
just tickle you some more.

08:39.659 --> 08:42.360
Not funny, Daddy.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.419
Not...
Whoa!

08:43.460 --> 08:45.060
funny... Daddy.
(giggling)

08:45.090 --> 08:47.760
Not funny.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.320
So what are we
rushing off to see?

08:52.360 --> 08:55.390
Well, I can't seem to get a
straight answer on that one.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.660
I asked Detective Scanlon if
he thought it might be useful

08:57.690 --> 08:59.190
to have you on the scene,

08:59.220 --> 09:01.220
and he indicated that it
certainly couldn't hurt.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.760
You seem awfully thirsty.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.360
You okay?

09:10.390 --> 09:11.990
It's the heat.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.160
You'd think, after all these
years, a body would adjust.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.220
REPORTER:
But I don't understand.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.690
Why are we not being told
the exact nature of the crime?

09:24.370 --> 09:25.970
DINOVI:
You're not being told
the exact nature

09:26.010 --> 09:28.010
of the crime because the
investigation is ongoing

09:28.040 --> 09:29.070
and has not yet reached a stage

09:29.070 --> 09:30.470
where we can make
that determination.

09:30.510 --> 09:31.810
REPORTER 2:
Where is the mayor?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.040
We're hearing rumors
of a cult-like slaughter,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.270
a Manson-style killing spree.

09:35.310 --> 09:36.910
Shouldn't the mayor be here?

09:36.940 --> 09:38.240
I spoke with the mayor
early this morning.

09:38.270 --> 09:40.670
He's rushing back
from a fact-finding mission.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.940
I'm sure he'll have plenty
to say when he gets here.

09:42.970 --> 09:44.240
Sorry, folks.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.140
I'm afraid that's all
I have for now.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.010
Thank you.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.340
Thanks.

09:52.870 --> 09:54.740
Fact finding mission?

09:54.770 --> 09:56.270
That's what
his girlfriend said.

09:56.310 --> 09:58.210
A Las Vegas
fact finding mission.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.670
Apparently, that's where
all the best facts are found.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.810
Okay.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.870
My interest is piqued.

10:04.910 --> 10:07.470
What exactly are we
looking at here, Lee?

10:07.510 --> 10:09.010
Not exactly sure yet.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.110
Wealthy family-- mother,
father, three kids.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.640
Live-in help had
the weekend off.

10:13.670 --> 10:14.910
Housekeeper
lets herself in

10:14.940 --> 10:17.670
at 5:00 a.m., discovers
all of them shot to death.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.270
Was it a robbery?

10:19.310 --> 10:21.240
Maid says
nothing's missing.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.770
Family attorney's
on his way over

10:22.810 --> 10:24.510
with a locksmith
to look in the vault,

10:24.540 --> 10:27.510
but our guys are telling
me it hasn't been touched.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.740
Put your party clothes on,
I'll show you what we got.

10:29.770 --> 10:32.140
SCANLON:
We're guessing
the wife here

10:32.170 --> 10:34.140
heard the shots
from the family room

10:34.170 --> 10:36.210
and was standing, attempting
to get out of the tub

10:36.240 --> 10:37.210
when her attacker came

10:37.240 --> 10:39.470
to this doorway.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.110
There was no weapon present
when the first team

10:54.140 --> 10:57.210
of responding officers
showed up this morning.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.070
Doesn't appear to be
a murder-suicide.

11:00.110 --> 11:01.170
TV REPORTER:
Now for more on
the market sell-off...

11:02.870 --> 11:03.940
Honey?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.770
TV REPORTER:
...early warning
stock predicting...

11:10.970 --> 11:13.110
The kids were all
shot in their beds.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.940
Dog's in here, too.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.440
DEVALOS:
Allison?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.640
Yeah, I know, the kids.

11:27.670 --> 11:31.370
I'll take your word for it.

11:32.810 --> 11:34.040
We need to find out
everything we can

11:34.040 --> 11:35.270
about the man
of the house.

11:35.310 --> 11:38.210
Maybe... it's
a revenge killing.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.110
Pretty savage
form of revenge.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.470
Maybe the attorney will open

11:41.510 --> 11:44.210
the safe and tell us
the family jewels are missing.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.970
Sorry, guys, but I seriously
doubt this was a robbery.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.870
Why do you say that?

11:48.910 --> 11:50.140
That's an Armand Vartanian,

11:50.170 --> 11:51.270
probably worth three quarters

11:51.310 --> 11:53.010
of a million dollars.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.740
I mean, if you're looking
for something of value.

11:55.770 --> 11:59.010
I'm gonna visit
the powder room,

11:59.040 --> 12:00.870
then we'll be
on our way.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.540
See you in about an hour.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.740
Can I help you?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.570
I don't know.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.640
I'm gonna call the police.

12:29.670 --> 12:31.840
If you need help,
they can help you.

12:31.870 --> 12:33.310
What?

12:33.340 --> 12:34.510
I would really appreciate it

12:34.540 --> 12:36.410
if you could just wait
for them the sidewalk.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.540
This your house?

12:40.570 --> 12:42.370
Phoenix Police, this
is Allison Dubois

12:42.410 --> 12:43.940
with the District
Attorney's office.

12:43.970 --> 12:44.940
Phoenix?

12:44.970 --> 12:46.840
I'm in Phoenix?
I made the plane?

12:46.870 --> 12:49.440
I have a man here
standing on my front porch.

12:49.470 --> 12:51.110
No, you don't.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.370
No, no, you don't.

12:52.410 --> 12:53.610
I don't know who he is.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.010
He didn't identify himself.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.740
Oh, that's not true.
That's not true.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.010
My name's Clay Bicks.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.810
Clay Bicks.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.110
Oh, my God.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.070
(chuckles):
Hey...

13:04.110 --> 13:05.940
Clay.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.070
You cut your hair.

13:10.110 --> 13:11.610
What'd you say
your last name was?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.310
Dubois.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.510
Benoit.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.610
Allison Benoit.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.770
Al.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.260
Cut your hair, too.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.240
Come here, you.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.870
No, no, back up, back up.

13:25.910 --> 13:29.170
I, uh... it's been awhile
between showers, you know?

13:30.910 --> 13:31.940
I still can't believe

13:31.970 --> 13:35.010
they let me on the plane.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.170
God, you look great.

13:37.210 --> 13:38.770
Plane from where?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.040
Indonesia.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.870
Indonesia.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.440
Yeah, I'm a shooter--
photographer.

13:43.470 --> 13:45.870
You know, magazines,
wire services.

13:45.910 --> 13:47.340
Sounds dangerous.

13:47.370 --> 13:48.540
I know.

13:48.570 --> 13:52.310
I get a little anxious
just talking about it.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.140
What kind of idiot
goes over there,

13:54.170 --> 13:55.640
seeks work like that, huh?

13:56.910 --> 13:58.670
They do have
a couple of

13:58.710 --> 14:01.070
excellent bars, though.

14:01.110 --> 14:04.740
Damn, you look, uh... great.

14:04.770 --> 14:07.710
You look different.

14:07.740 --> 14:10.070
And how dare you change
when I wasn't looking?

14:10.110 --> 14:12.610
Well, it's a long time
since high school, Clay.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.170
Yeah... You got
kids now, huh?

14:14.210 --> 14:15.410
Mm-hmm.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.970
Yeah... Why'd you go
do that without me?

14:18.010 --> 14:21.410
What, just 'cause you ain't
seen me in 17, 18 years?

14:23.140 --> 14:25.570
Bet you're
married now, huh?

14:25.610 --> 14:27.870
Happy, well-adjusted.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.710
Bet you never get
stinking drunk.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.040
Bet you bathe every day.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.220
You know...

14:40.220 --> 14:43.460
I got a weird confession
to make.

14:43.490 --> 14:45.890
I been in a couple
of hairy spots in my life.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.490
Stared down a couple of
loaded barrels,

14:48.520 --> 14:51.320
had a couple of
scary helicopter rides.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.920
Got taken hostage once
for three days in Samoa.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.760
And you know that moment when
you're thinking, "This is it."

14:58.790 --> 15:01.620
You know,
the Clay Bicks Show is over.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.160
You know who'd keep
popping in my head?

15:07.190 --> 15:08.460
You.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.520
Ms. Benoit.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.090
Voted most likely
to stay in someone's head

15:14.120 --> 15:17.790
long after they've let them go.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.820
Maybe they shouldn't have.

15:25.890 --> 15:29.520
You're my favorite regret.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.220
You don't remember
getting on the plane?

15:37.260 --> 15:39.160
Nah, I was pretty loaded.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.020
And you don't remember
getting off here in Phoenix?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.920
Why don't you come in the house?

15:49.960 --> 15:51.720
We'll have a cup
of coffee, and...

16:00.430 --> 16:02.960
mom this is......???

16:02.960 --> 16:05.710
and ????

16:05.740 --> 16:07.020
so...????

16:07.020 --> 16:07.670
you know.do???

16:09.420 --> 16:11.090
Just...
I'll be there in a second.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.070
BRIDGETTE:
Are we having dinner yet?

16:14.070 --> 16:15.840
ARIEL: Uh, what are you
talking about?

16:15.840 --> 16:18.500
Daddy's not even home yet.
And it's, like, 5:30.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.000
And why are you
in your pajamas?

16:20.040 --> 16:21.440
Well, as soon
as dinner's over,

16:21.470 --> 16:22.770
I want to go
right to bed.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.770
Why?
I had the funnest
dream last night.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.070
It was a cartoon
called The Monkeyheads,

16:27.100 --> 16:28.640
and I can't wait
to see more of it.

16:28.670 --> 16:29.640
TheMonkeyheads?!

16:29.670 --> 16:31.470
That's so over.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.300
That was on when
I was little.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.470
BRIDGETTE:
So? I don't care.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.870
I still like it.

16:37.940 --> 16:41.770
DEVALOS:
Yeah... my whole
morning's open.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.470
Just set the appointment,
e-mail me the time.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.970
Right. I'm home now.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.900
Just e-mail me the time.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.870
Okay.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.240
Whew... Damn.

16:56.270 --> 16:59.140
There are just some
days that can't end

16:59.170 --> 17:01.640
fast enough.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.500
Mmm! Smells good.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.540
Smells good.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.740
Call them back
and tell them

17:08.770 --> 17:09.770
you're not free
tomorrow morning.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.770
I called Dr. Berman.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.240
He remembered you.

17:14.270 --> 17:15.900
I made an appointment
for 10:30.

17:15.940 --> 17:18.640
I'll drive you.

17:18.670 --> 17:19.869
I'm a grown man.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.839
I can make my own
doctor's appointments,

17:21.869 --> 17:23.869
thank you very much.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.470
There's something
wrong, Manuel.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.940
I'm worried you're
falling apart inside.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.540
Sometimes, I wake up
in the morning,

17:36.570 --> 17:38.770
and you're laying
there and I...

17:38.800 --> 17:42.340
I think you're dead.

17:42.370 --> 17:44.800
I can't hear you breathe,
you're covered in sweat,

17:44.840 --> 17:46.100
you're white as a ghost.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.570
I'm fine.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.240
It's Phoenix-- it's
hot and I sweat.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.740
Tomorrow, I will
find a doctor.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.470
I will call and I will
make an appointment.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.540
And when the time comes,
I'll drive myself.

17:57.570 --> 18:00.670
Right now, I'm hungry,
and I'm, uh...

18:00.700 --> 18:02.670
gonna eat.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.940
How do you think
he knew where you lived?

18:23.620 --> 18:25.750
I have no idea.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.820
How do you think
he knew you'd be home?

18:27.850 --> 18:30.220
I have no idea.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.490
What do you think he wanted?

18:32.520 --> 18:36.050
(sighs):
I have no idea.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.790
I think maybe
I'm a little jealous.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.720
He's dead, Joe.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.050
Well, you know,
in some ways,

18:46.090 --> 18:48.090
that could give him
an unfair advantage.

18:55.950 --> 18:58.050
I don't think
he knows he's dead.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.720
What? You trying to get me
to feel sorry for him?

19:00.750 --> 19:01.820
I think maybe

19:01.850 --> 19:03.420
that's why he's here.

19:03.450 --> 19:06.490
Maybe that's why
he's waiting for me.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.890
I think maybe
I'm supposed to tell him.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.190
You don't think
he'll get the gist

19:11.220 --> 19:13.290
when he looks in the mirror
and there's nobody there?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.390
When the phone
stops ringing?

19:16.420 --> 19:18.690
When nobody bothers
to check his theater stub

19:18.720 --> 19:20.850
after he comes back
from the candy counter?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.600
I think they've
got a pretty good

19:23.640 --> 19:25.700
orientation system
already in place.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.270
Then why did I have
that encounter?

19:30.300 --> 19:31.640
And why was he brought here?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.570
I don't know, he needed
the extra frequent flier miles,

19:34.600 --> 19:35.840
figured an extra stopover?

19:35.870 --> 19:36.870
I believe these things

19:36.900 --> 19:38.140
happen to me for a reason.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.840
The challenge is
to have the patience

19:39.870 --> 19:42.540
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.470
Hmm... profundity.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.370
If I dig it out, will you write
that in my high school yearbook?

19:49.540 --> 19:51.470
(singsong):
Someone is jealous.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.240
Of your high school boyfriend?
I think not.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.440
He was pretty wild.

19:57.470 --> 19:58.500
I was pretty wild.

19:58.540 --> 20:00.670
Well, he's not wild now.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.040
I'm sorry.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.920
I've really had
my fill of death today.

20:14.950 --> 20:17.420
I really have.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.300
Deputy Mayor DiNovi.
I'll tell you what I know.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.170
The Costigans all died
early this morning

20:25.200 --> 20:26.500
of close-range shotgun wounds.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.500
Preliminary investigations
suggest that the killings

20:29.540 --> 20:31.240
were not related to
Mr. Costigan's employment.

20:31.270 --> 20:34.000
We are aware of
similar home invasions

20:34.040 --> 20:35.870
in Wyoming and New Mexico

20:35.900 --> 20:37.740
during the last 12 months.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.940
Beyond that,
it's an active investigation.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.370
Hopefully, we'll know
more in the morning.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.800
WOMAN:
Do you have
anything to say

20:43.840 --> 20:46.270
to the people of Phoenix
who are obviously frightened?

20:48.270 --> 20:50.140
Phoenix is a safe city.

20:50.170 --> 20:52.540
But obviously, people need
to take precautions.

20:52.570 --> 20:54.570
Lock your doors,
lock your windows.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.840
Check in on your loved ones,

20:55.870 --> 20:57.740
check in on your neighbors,

20:57.770 --> 21:01.800
and know that we are
gonna find these people.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
We're gonna stop these people.

21:03.870 --> 21:06.740
REPORTER:
And what does the mayor have
to say about all this?

21:06.770 --> 21:09.170
DINOVI:
The mayor fell ill
prior to boarding a plane

21:09.200 --> 21:10.200
back to Phoenix this morning.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.200
(phone ringing)

21:15.370 --> 21:16.670
Hey.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.370
Yeah, I saw it;
of course I saw it.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.040
You were great.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.900
You couldn't hear me cheering
from over here?

21:23.270 --> 21:24.540
You coming over?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.300
I don't care.

21:27.340 --> 21:29.570
Ring the bell, wake me up.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.570
I mean it.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.640
2:00 in the morning.
Whenever.

21:31.670 --> 21:32.740
Wake me up.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.600
It was so random.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.700
They were so unprepared.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.340
I mean, in his wildest dreams,
could he have ever imagined

22:03.370 --> 22:07.400
that he would have died
lying on his belly...

22:07.440 --> 22:09.340
reading the paper?

22:09.370 --> 22:12.440
And the mom.

22:12.470 --> 22:16.470
Was she singing in the shower,
seconds before it happened?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.770
And the kids.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.040
What were they dreaming about

22:23.070 --> 22:25.500
before their lives
were snuffed out?

22:27.670 --> 22:30.270
Are you sure
everything's locked?

22:30.300 --> 22:32.170
I'll go check again.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.170
Mom?

23:48.270 --> 23:50.500
Mom?!

23:50.540 --> 23:52.940
Mom...!

23:57.800 --> 23:59.900
Mom, please!

24:01.500 --> 24:02.900
Mom!

24:02.940 --> 24:04.300
Help!

24:11.670 --> 24:12.900
BRIDGETTE:
Mommy...

24:12.940 --> 24:16.170
I just had a bad dream.

24:17.470 --> 24:19.140
Yeah, me, too.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.100
You know you don't have
to go to bed early

24:21.100 --> 24:22.940
to see The Monkeyheads,
they're all out on DVD.

24:22.970 --> 24:24.070
Well, I don't care!

24:24.100 --> 24:25.570
I hate The Monkeyheads!

24:25.600 --> 24:28.100
Somebody had
a nightmare last night.

24:28.140 --> 24:30.400
So that's what you were doing
in our bed

24:30.440 --> 24:32.600
this morning.
Well, Monkeyheads are scary.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.740
Monkeyheads aren't scary,
they're just stupid.

24:34.770 --> 24:36.200
You're stupid!

24:36.240 --> 24:37.340
Nobody's stupid.

24:37.370 --> 24:38.370
Marie, baby, we're all out

24:38.400 --> 24:40.070
of Nutty Wutteys.
How about

24:40.100 --> 24:42.440
some flakes?

24:42.470 --> 24:44.470
We have millions of kinds
of flakes.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.300
I want some eggs!

24:47.470 --> 24:48.970
Did you see this?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.240
How do you feel about frying
your daughter some eggs,

24:51.270 --> 24:52.270
so I could sit down

24:52.300 --> 24:53.900
and have myself
a cup of...
Oh, sure.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.740
I'm done.
I'm done.

24:55.770 --> 24:58.000
Daddy's making you eggs.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.140
Thanks, Daddy.

25:00.170 --> 25:02.100
So, I know that Bridgette
had a nightmare.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.340
Tell me about your nightlife.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.840
Any visits from old boyfriends?

25:05.870 --> 25:07.070
No.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.340
I suppose he figured out
where he was supposed to be,

25:09.370 --> 25:10.970
and how to get there,
all by himself.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.540
What do you mean?
Are you telling me

25:12.570 --> 25:14.970
that you actually had
a sound night's sleep?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.670
I didn't say that;
I just didn't see

25:16.700 --> 25:19.000
any news you can use,
if you know what I mean.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.800
Nothing about Clay,

25:20.840 --> 25:22.600
nothing about this.

25:22.640 --> 25:26.300
I did have a terryfying dream
about a little  b-o-y.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.540
That took place I
don't know where,

25:28.570 --> 25:31.500
I don't know when,
involving I don't know who.

25:31.540 --> 25:32.640
Isn't that what you said

25:32.670 --> 25:33.940
about your Indonesian nightmare?

25:33.970 --> 25:36.370
I mean, before you realized who
and what it was really about.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.840
Well, that's what has me
so worried.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.870
Oh, Lee.

25:49.900 --> 25:50.780
Can I talk to you
about something?

25:50.790 --> 25:52.450
I don't know if it
means anything but...

25:52.490 --> 25:53.920
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.620
You mind taking a ride,
we'll talk in the car?
Sure.

25:56.650 --> 25:58.650
What's going on?

25:59.820 --> 26:01.820
Some hikers spotted a
minivan, sitting upside-down

26:02.050 --> 26:05.440
in a couple feet of water.
?????es in it.

26:05.570 --> 26:06.470
There are.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.840
A mother and her son.

26:08.870 --> 26:11.700
Okay.

26:11.740 --> 26:13.440
And you wanted to
talk to me about...?

26:13.470 --> 26:15.470
We just covered it.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.740
Someone slept alone
last night.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.140
You really are psychic.

26:31.400 --> 26:31.500
Ha, ha.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.270
Shaving cream.
Yeah, clever.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.970
No woman would let a man
leave home like that.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.700
Yeah, well, wasn't
for lack of trying.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.740
She's just been working
all hours.

26:39.770 --> 26:42.070
Between this home invasion thing
and the mayor

26:42.100 --> 26:43.470
flaking out.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.800
Hm.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.520
How old were you
when you got married?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.620
Me? Um... nine.

26:51.650 --> 26:53.420
I've been married 12 years.

26:53.450 --> 26:54.920
So, yeah, nine, mm-hmm.

26:54.950 --> 26:57.290
Yeah, well, I'm
pushing 14 myself.

27:01.050 --> 27:03.650
You know, I never really
lived with anyone.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.320
Not long-term.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.150
Hey, if it works for you.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.790
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure
it does anymore.

27:11.550 --> 27:14.320
Tough to make the leap.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.970
But I'm thinking there might be
some leaping in my future.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.140
Well, go on, Baryshnikov.

27:37.370 --> 27:39.420
You can see where the big SUV
pushed against it,

27:39.420 --> 27:40.590
forced it off the road.

27:42.420 --> 27:45.050
Maybe.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.070
It's just so eerie.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.840
Everything I dreamt about
happened.

28:00.870 --> 28:04.400
Well, that has to give you
some sense of satisfaction.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.870
No, it doesn't.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.300
I feel like
a walking carnival trick.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.400
I dreamt about this little boy
drowning to death.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.540
What do you know?

28:12.570 --> 28:13.870
It really happened.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.100
What is the point?

28:15.140 --> 28:17.840
Why show it to me
if I can't prevent it?

28:17.870 --> 28:20.700
So I have answers
for the police questions

28:20.740 --> 28:23.100
15 minutes before they
would have them otherwise?

28:23.140 --> 28:24.840
You know, um,

28:24.870 --> 28:27.500
a very intuitive lady
once said to me...

28:27.540 --> 28:30.340
"I believe these things happen
to me for a reason,

28:30.370 --> 28:32.100
"and the challenge is having
the patience

28:32.140 --> 28:34.500
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself."

28:34.540 --> 28:36.000
Oh, zip it.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.800
Anyway, I called Mrs.
Pasternack down the street.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.500
She's going to take the girls
home with her.

28:41.540 --> 28:44.100
So if you could stop by
her place on the way home...

28:44.140 --> 28:46.770
Thy will be done.

28:51.270 --> 28:53.100
CRIME TECH:
Everything we can do
here, we've done.

28:53.140 --> 28:54.240
The rest of it

28:54.270 --> 28:55.940
really ought to happen
back at the lab.

28:55.970 --> 28:58.000
I made a call-- flatbed's
on its way out here.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.700
Anything you want to share?

28:59.740 --> 29:00.900
Well, wherever
they were going,

29:00.940 --> 29:03.500
they knew it was going to
take them a while to get there.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.940
Car's full of clothes,
toiletries...

29:05.970 --> 29:07.070
No maps, though.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.070
No tickets or brochures.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.170
You get the feeling that maybe

29:10.200 --> 29:11.440
it was
a pretty spontaneous trip.

29:11.470 --> 29:13.500
But you got a lot of
the kinds of things

29:13.540 --> 29:17.100
you see on a long road trip,
like DVDs for the kid,

29:17.140 --> 29:19.370
fast food wrappers,
juice boxes...

29:19.400 --> 29:21.340
What's this?
It was in the player.

29:21.370 --> 29:22.970
They must've had it on

29:23.000 --> 29:24.740
when they went over the side--
The MonkeyHeads.

29:24.770 --> 29:27.000
Did you say Monkeyheads?

29:27.040 --> 29:28.300
Mm-hmm.

29:28.340 --> 29:30.200
SCANLON:
What's the big deal?

29:30.240 --> 29:31.500
Does that mean something?

29:31.540 --> 29:32.510
(gasping):
Oh, boy...

29:42.020 --> 29:43.250
Hey, I'm home.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.850
Shh, shh, shh.
You'll wake the baby.

29:45.890 --> 29:47.340
Marie's already down?

29:47.340 --> 29:48.570
Have you looked
at your watch?

29:48.600 --> 29:50.240
It's after 9:00.

29:50.270 --> 29:52.770
Wow.
You do good work.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.070
What about Bridgette?

29:54.100 --> 29:55.570
I really need to
talk to Bridgette.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.700
Well, I don't know,

29:56.740 --> 29:58.340
she's been in bed
for half an hour,

29:58.370 --> 30:00.440
but I couldn't tell you
if she's asleep or not,

30:00.470 --> 30:02.340
'cause she fought me
every step of the way.

30:02.370 --> 30:04.400
Three days ago, she couldn't
wait to get to bed,

30:04.440 --> 30:05.470
and now she acts like

30:05.500 --> 30:07.100
I'm sending her off
to the electric chair.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.500
You going to have
some food?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.400
Later.
(sighs)

30:11.440 --> 30:13.400
Did you feel that?

30:13.440 --> 30:14.540
What?

30:14.570 --> 30:15.940
That blast of cold air?

30:15.970 --> 30:19.100
What are you talking about?

30:19.140 --> 30:22.240
I don't even think
the air-conditioning's on.

30:22.270 --> 30:22.440
I don't know.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.870
I've been
feeling them all night.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.600
Maybe it's just my imagination.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.770
Maybe you're going through
the change of life.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.300
Ah, could be.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.270
(whispering):
Bridgette.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.900
Bridgette?

30:43.970 --> 30:45.970
Hey. Hey.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.870
(gently):
Hey...

30:47.900 --> 30:49.470
What are you doing
with this?

30:49.500 --> 30:51.000
This is your sister's.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.640
Well, I wasn't hurting it.

30:52.670 --> 30:54.500
I was just listening to it.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.370
Well, you're not supposed
to be listening to it,

30:56.400 --> 30:58.270
you're supposed
to be asleep.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.100
Well, I don't want to be asleep.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.840
Sleeping is scary.

31:01.870 --> 31:04.100
I seeMonkeyheads
when I sleep.

31:04.140 --> 31:06.940
And why is that scary?

31:06.970 --> 31:09.040
Monkeyheads aren't scary.
Monkeyheads are funny.

31:09.070 --> 31:11.140
No, no, they're not.
Not lately.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.370
Really?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.140
Tell me what you've seen.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.640
Well, the other night,

31:19.670 --> 31:22.340
this mama monkey
and this baby monkey,

31:22.370 --> 31:23.470
they were in their car,

31:23.500 --> 31:25.870
and then these bad monkeys
chased them

31:25.900 --> 31:27.700
and chased them

31:27.740 --> 31:30.870
and then pushed them right off
the road and into this lake.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.640
And then?

31:32.670 --> 31:34.240
And then they just sat there,

31:34.270 --> 31:37.000
and they were upside-down,
and they were bleeding,

31:37.040 --> 31:39.240
and the car got filled
up all with water.

31:39.270 --> 31:40.800
And they just sat there.

31:40.840 --> 31:43.540
And then they were breathing
funny little cartoon bubbles.

31:43.570 --> 31:46.740
And then they
finally fell asleep,

31:46.770 --> 31:48.970
and turned into Angel Monkeys,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.840
and floated out the car
and up to heaven.

31:55.570 --> 31:57.540
Sweetie...

31:57.570 --> 32:00.440
Well, I can see why
you wouldn't want to have

32:00.470 --> 32:03.140
another dream like that.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.400
But here's
the thing, Bridge--

32:05.440 --> 32:09.140
I am almost 100% sure

32:09.170 --> 32:11.970
that the bad dreams are over.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.340
I really think it's okay
to go back to sleep.

32:15.370 --> 32:17.440
You do?
I do.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.700
And if, for some strange reason,
I'm wrong,

32:19.740 --> 32:21.840
you can come into my bed.

32:21.870 --> 32:25.840
But... I don't think I'm wrong.

32:25.870 --> 32:27.770
I think the bad dream
is over.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.470
Well, I hope so.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.970
'Cause it's really tiring
trying not to sleep.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.640
She dreamt it, too.

32:35.670 --> 32:37.200
The little boy,
the drowning.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.740
What are you
talking about?

32:38.770 --> 32:41.100
She dreamt a cartoon version
of the same thing I did.

32:41.140 --> 32:42.970
Cartoon?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.940
Why a cartoon?

32:44.970 --> 32:46.440
The little boy

32:46.470 --> 32:48.300
was watching cartoons
when he drowned.

32:48.340 --> 32:51.240
I suppose he was trying to make
peace with the way he died,

32:51.270 --> 32:54.100
trying to find someone
to tell his story to.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.040
They're about
the same age.

32:57.070 --> 32:59.470
I hate that she dreams
that stuff.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.900
I know.

33:00.940 --> 33:04.270
For what it's worth,
I think she's okay.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.570
She really thinks
it is a cartoon.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.740
A scary cartoon,
but still a cartoon.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.470
And I do think it's over.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.770
Oh...

33:13.800 --> 33:15.270
God.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.940
Tell me you don't feel that.

33:16.970 --> 33:18.570
Feel what?

33:18.600 --> 33:19.940
It's like arctic.

33:19.970 --> 33:23.070
You didn't feel
that cold blast of air?

33:23.100 --> 33:27.040
Come here, let me
feel your head.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.540
You don't feel feverish.

33:34.570 --> 33:36.100
But why don't you go
lay down in bed?

33:36.140 --> 33:37.540
I'll be in in a minute.

33:37.570 --> 33:38.740
I don't feel sick.

33:38.770 --> 33:40.570
I don't know what to tell you.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.170
It's Phoenix, Arizona.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.740
If you're feeling the chills,
you're getting sick.

33:44.770 --> 33:46.070
Just go.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.940
I'll clean up.
I'll lock up.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.840
Hey, Al.

34:09.870 --> 34:12.500
Sorry about the cold.

34:12.540 --> 34:15.440
I hear it goes away,
eventually, though.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.600
What else have you heard?

34:18.639 --> 34:22.040
Oh... that you can see me.

34:22.070 --> 34:24.300
That you can hear me.

34:24.340 --> 34:28.100
That, uh, that's pretty rare.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.469
I am really sorry, Clay.

34:32.469 --> 34:35.120
The other day,
outside my house...

34:35.120 --> 34:36.230
I wasn't sure.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.540
I thought you might be...

34:38.570 --> 34:40.300
But I wasn't sure.

34:42.340 --> 34:45.199
I'm really glad you're here.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.800
I'm really glad
I get to say good-bye.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.600
Don't be sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.

34:50.639 --> 34:53.969
Truth is, I've been flirting
with this all my life.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.540
Now that I'm here...

34:56.570 --> 35:00.170
it's not like the view's
all that bad.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.640
You know what
else I heard?

35:04.670 --> 35:06.400
What's that?

35:06.440 --> 35:09.700
That if I try hard enough,

35:09.740 --> 35:14.070
that if I want it bad enough,

35:14.100 --> 35:17.840
sometimes, someone like me

35:17.870 --> 35:21.740
can be felt...

35:21.770 --> 35:24.070
by someone like you.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.070
I have to tell you,
I've never...

35:26.100 --> 35:28.200
Allison?

35:28.240 --> 35:29.940
Do you want a hand
locking up?

35:32.240 --> 35:34.500
Uh... sure.

35:34.540 --> 35:37.500
Absolutely.

35:48.470 --> 35:50.140
Hello, Detective.

35:50.170 --> 35:51.390
Your deputy-ship.

35:51.390 --> 35:52.990
Haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.390
You know what's been going on.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.520
I look up from my desk,
it's 11:00 at night.

35:56.550 --> 35:57.850
Well, the mayor's
back in town now.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.620
I saw it right on the
front page of the paper.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.650
No reason for you not
to come over tonight.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.450
Well, then maybe I will.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.650
Well, if you ring the bell,
maybe I'll let you in.

36:05.690 --> 36:06.950
10:00-ish okay?

36:06.990 --> 36:08.630
I got a call from this woman
in the third district.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.040
Worked on our last campaign.

36:10.070 --> 36:11.240
Wants to buy me a drink.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.340
She was very insistent.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.440
You sure it was a woman?

36:15.820 --> 36:17.200
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

36:17.200 --> 36:18.440
Oh, um...

36:18.470 --> 36:22.440
So... 10:00-ish.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.840
Hey.

36:30.870 --> 36:32.800
Hey.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.100
(clears throat)
Allison here yet?

36:35.140 --> 36:37.340
She's the one who wanted
to have this meeting.

36:37.370 --> 36:40.070
I've got a doctor's thing
this afternoon,

36:40.100 --> 36:41.500
desk full of work.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.200
Excuse me.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.140
SCANLON:
The dead woman, the
driver of the minivan,

36:48.170 --> 36:50.000
name is Olga Bankova.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.500
She's a naturalized
U.S. citizen,

36:51.540 --> 36:54.100
34 years old, single mother,
artist of some kind.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.870
Also works as a substitute
teacher; no priors.

36:55.900 --> 36:58.540
They were over 200 miles
from home when they died.

36:58.570 --> 37:01.070
The child in the backseat
was her son Ian.

37:01.100 --> 37:02.070
Seven years old.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.300
What else do we know?
Not much.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.200
We're checking paint and body
shops around the state,

37:06.240 --> 37:08.500
looking for any large vehicles
with horizontal abrasions

37:08.540 --> 37:09.800
consistent with
the minivan's.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.300
So...

37:12.340 --> 37:14.840
we're certain the car
was pushed into that lake bed?

37:14.870 --> 37:17.370
No.
Yes.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.400
No one in the crime lab
is willing to say

37:19.440 --> 37:21.240
in a definitive way that the
minivan was actually pushed

37:21.270 --> 37:22.130
into that lake bed.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.550
Yes, there's paint on the car,
yes, the side is scraped

37:24.550 --> 37:25.790
consistent with that kind
of scenario

37:25.820 --> 37:27.350
but the vehicle also took
about a 40-foot fall,

37:27.390 --> 37:28.750
which could account
for the damage

37:28.790 --> 37:31.050
and the mismatched paint could
also be from a previous mishap.

37:31.090 --> 37:32.390
That coupled with the fact
that no one

37:32.420 --> 37:34.220
can seem to come up
with any kind of motive...

37:34.250 --> 37:36.150
I know that she was pushed
off the road.

37:36.190 --> 37:37.990
I saw it happen.
My daughter saw it, too.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.050
Your daughter?

37:40.090 --> 37:41.350
Really?

37:41.390 --> 37:42.590
Did either one of you,
perchance,

37:42.620 --> 37:44.090
see who was driving
the other vehicle?

37:44.120 --> 37:47.050
I didn't, no.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.780
What about your daughter?

37:49.790 --> 37:52.620
My daughter doesn't have any
information you could use.

37:52.650 --> 37:53.890
I don't understand.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.220
I'm gathering that, like you,

37:56.250 --> 37:57.990
your daughter saw all this
in a dream.

37:58.020 --> 38:00.490
Don't you think
it might be useful to us

38:00.520 --> 38:02.750
to interview her, see
if we couldn't piece together

38:02.790 --> 38:04.250
some kind of description?

38:04.290 --> 38:06.750
I'm familiar with a number of
people from around the state

38:06.790 --> 38:08.250
who have a lot of expertise

38:08.290 --> 38:09.750
when it comes
to interviewing children.

38:09.790 --> 38:12.590
I mean, we'd have to finesse
the whole dream thing,

38:12.620 --> 38:14.750
but I'm sure
it could be handled.

38:16.790 --> 38:20.950
She saw them,
but she didn't see them.

38:21.850 --> 38:23.520
Look, it was a cartoon.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.150
She saw the whole thing
as a cartoon.

38:25.190 --> 38:29.020
The people who pushed
the minivan off the road

38:29.050 --> 38:31.190
were cartoon people.

38:31.220 --> 38:35.050
Everybody was a cartoon.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.220
I see.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.700
Any news
on the home invasion front?

38:42.740 --> 38:44.200
SCANLON:
Not really. No.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.200
Place turned out to be
amazingly clean.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.800
I mean,
clearly these guys were pros.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.370
Aha.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.720
No leads
on the home invasion front.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.350
Dark cartoon forces at work,

38:54.390 --> 38:56.050
pushing vehicles off
our thoroughfares.

38:56.090 --> 38:57.950
It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.820
Excuse me?

38:59.850 --> 39:01.520
You're excused.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.190
(mimics):
"It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney."

39:06.190 --> 39:07.680
You know the man's under
a lot of pressure.

39:07.690 --> 39:09.720
That's not the point.
It was mean.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.850
It was needlessly mean.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.050
He's not himself.

39:12.090 --> 39:13.490
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.350
Who are you guys talking about?
Nobody.

39:15.390 --> 39:17.190
You know, all they're talking
about on the radio is

39:17.220 --> 39:18.520
how these guys are
still out there,

39:18.550 --> 39:20.620
it's just a matter of time
before they do it again.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.990
Okay, I get it.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.390
He's under a lot of pressure
on that case,

39:24.420 --> 39:25.990
and I'm not helping him
on that case.

39:26.020 --> 39:27.150
Well, I'm sorry.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.790
I wish I could pick and choose
what I dream

39:28.820 --> 39:30.320
on any given day, but I can't.

39:30.350 --> 39:31.690
So it isn't
the crime du jour.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.190
I can't help that.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.750
I see what I see, and I know
what I know and my daughter...

39:35.790 --> 39:37.090
Uh-uh...
I think you're blowing this

39:37.120 --> 39:38.950
way out of proportion.
My daughter

39:38.990 --> 39:40.790
doesn't get to specify
the style of presentation

39:40.820 --> 39:43.920
when someone reaches out to her
from the great beyond

39:43.950 --> 39:46.090
to tell her something.
"Well, I'm sorry,

39:46.120 --> 39:47.950
we're not accepting
cartoon dreams today."

39:47.990 --> 39:50.890
The district attorney prefers
his clues from the other side

39:50.920 --> 39:52.520
more straightforward.

39:52.550 --> 39:53.890
More crime, less character.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.850
More like an episode
of Law & Order.

39:55.890 --> 39:56.850
Allison.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.450
Are you talking about me?

39:58.490 --> 40:00.050
No, honey,
nobody's talking about you.

40:00.090 --> 40:01.850
Nobody's talking about anybody.

40:01.890 --> 40:04.290
I need a bath.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.150
Is something wrong, Mommy?

40:07.190 --> 40:08.450
It's not you guys.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.420
Mommy just had a hard day.

40:11.490 --> 40:14.550
No, I'm, uh, I'm still here.

40:14.590 --> 40:16.420
Of course.
I know it's dinnertime.

40:16.450 --> 40:17.750
He just wanted
to run some tests,

40:17.790 --> 40:20.690
and I'm just sitting here
waiting for the results.

40:22.390 --> 40:24.050
I'll call you when I'm done.

40:24.090 --> 40:25.720
I love you, too.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.520
I've been guarding
it with my life.

40:39.550 --> 40:42.190
I appreciate it.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.720
Yeah?

40:50.750 --> 40:52.220
Bridge and Marie are down.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.250
Ariel's taking a shower.

40:54.290 --> 40:56.890
I thought I would just lock up
and go to bed.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.950
Oh, my God,
how long have I been in here?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.150
That's all right;
you look comfortable.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.420
You're allowed.

41:01.450 --> 41:03.720
I'll be back.
I won't let you drown.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.550
WOMAN:
We're very aware
of everything

41:20.590 --> 41:22.120
that's been going on
with the mayor.

41:22.150 --> 41:25.590
We're all aware
of how mercurial he can be.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.650
You've been very deft

41:27.690 --> 41:29.250
the way you've covered for him.

41:29.290 --> 41:30.890
That's my job.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.050
Oh, and you
do it well.

41:32.090 --> 41:36.420
You seem very, um,
at ease on television.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.580
Oh?

41:37.590 --> 41:39.880
Have you ever considered
running for office?

41:39.890 --> 41:41.350
Excuse me?

41:41.350 --> 41:44.720
We'd like to see you go after
a spot on city council.

42:06.420 --> 42:07.990
Oh, let me ask
you something.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.620
How do I do this?

42:09.650 --> 42:10.790
Just ask her.

42:10.820 --> 42:11.890
You got a boyfriend?

42:11.920 --> 42:13.850
Hopefully, a doctor
or a lawyer.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.790
Someone with some standing.

42:18.090 --> 42:19.850
I'm just kidding.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.850
But seriously, is there someone
we should know about?

42:23.890 --> 42:27.250
Whoever they are,
they're going to end up
being very involved.

42:27.250 --> 42:28.320
Please, whomever it might be,

42:28.350 --> 42:30.050
just don't let it be
a civil servant.

42:30.090 --> 42:32.220
All of the union agreements
are coming up in January,

42:32.250 --> 42:33.650
(laughs):
and that's all we need.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.120
I'd do that for you,
if I could.

42:50.450 --> 42:52.230
I'm beginning to think
it's a big lie.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.100
What are you doing here?

42:57.850 --> 42:59.050
But that's crazy.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.110
That's wrong.
You can't be here.

43:02.150 --> 43:03.830
You can't do this.

43:03.830 --> 43:05.900
I have a family,
and you have someplace

43:05.930 --> 43:07.060
you're supposed to be.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.760
Well, I like it here.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.560
I like your house;
it feels good.

43:10.600 --> 43:11.700
I like your kids.

43:11.730 --> 43:14.060
You're not thinking clearly.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.060
You must still be in shock.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.600
And you're leaving
out my husband.

43:17.630 --> 43:19.100
I have a husband.
I have a life.

43:19.130 --> 43:20.760
Really?
(door opens)

43:20.800 --> 43:22.200
Locked and loaded.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.900
Hey, you know what?

43:28.930 --> 43:31.730
Wet becomes you, my darling.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.200
You look good like that.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.360
I may toss you
in that tub every night.

43:37.430 --> 43:39.060
"Wet becomes you"?

43:40.860 --> 43:43.160
This is so unfair.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.260
(chuckles)
What's that?
I say the wrong thing?

43:46.300 --> 43:47.760
You want me to go?

43:47.800 --> 43:49.460
Just say, "Clay,
I need you to go."

43:49.500 --> 43:51.630
JOE:
I can't help it.
You come over here

43:51.660 --> 43:54.760
and look at yourself
in that water,

43:54.800 --> 43:56.760
in the candlelight.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.200
Sorry, baby, it's
bigger than both of us.

43:59.230 --> 44:00.500
Kind of a goofball, huh?

44:00.530 --> 44:02.430
Stop it.

44:02.460 --> 44:03.530
You're seriously
bothered?

44:03.560 --> 44:06.960
Just say, "Clay, I need
you to go."

44:07.000 --> 44:09.360
See, this is it.
This is the kind of stuff.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.200
This is why we were
never meant to be.

44:13.260 --> 44:14.460
What are you talking about?

44:14.500 --> 44:16.130
"Never meant to be"?

44:16.160 --> 44:18.230
Does he know he's got
toothpaste on his mouth?

44:18.260 --> 44:20.660
Does he have any idea
how sad and pathetic

44:20.700 --> 44:22.530
this all is?
Clay, I need you to go!

44:22.560 --> 44:24.560
Clay?

44:25.930 --> 44:27.230
Did you say "Clay"?

44:28.300 --> 44:30.330
As in high school Clay?

44:30.360 --> 44:32.130
Is he here?

44:33.160 --> 44:35.700
Allison?

44:35.730 --> 44:37.300
Hey, Allison!

44:37.330 --> 44:39.400
Allison!

45:34.200 --> 45:36.260
(screaming):
Mommy!

45:36.300 --> 45:38.330
Is he in here?
I don't see him, no.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.900
Then where is he, Allison?

45:39.930 --> 45:41.560
I don't know.
I don't see him, either.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.000
You expect me
to believe that?

45:43.030 --> 45:45.000
BRIDGETTE (screaming):
Mommy!

45:51.760 --> 45:54.100
Hello?

45:54.130 --> 45:55.160
Hey, you still coming over?

45:55.200 --> 45:56.230
How'd the drink thing go?

45:56.260 --> 45:58.500
They just left.
It went great.

45:58.530 --> 46:00.530
It went really great.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.360
But I need to talk
to you about something.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.200
Anything.
What's going on?

46:06.800 --> 46:08.660
Hang on a second, honey,
I'm getting another call.

46:12.860 --> 46:15.700
Baby, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to hold.

46:15.730 --> 46:17.530
I just got a call.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.130
Somebody hit a mansion
in Bear Park.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.530
I don't have all
the details yet,

46:20.560 --> 46:23.830
but, uh, looks like I'm gonna
have to run out there.

46:27.930 --> 46:29.900
Hello?

46:31.260 --> 46:32.900
Oh, yes, I understand.

46:32.930 --> 46:34.900
He's right here.

46:36.430 --> 46:38.400
Manuel?

46:38.430 --> 46:40.800
What are you doing?

46:40.830 --> 46:43.830
There's been another one
of those house things.

46:43.860 --> 46:45.860
Okay, I know.

46:47.260 --> 46:48.660
The light is on, right?

46:48.700 --> 46:50.160
You turned
on the lamp?

46:50.200 --> 46:52.060
The lamp is on?
What are you talking about?

46:52.100 --> 46:53.600
Yes, the light is on.
They're on the phone.

46:53.630 --> 46:56.160
Shh, don't panic. Just tell them
I'll call them back.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.660
What are you talking about
you'll "call them back"?

46:58.700 --> 46:59.960
Lilly...

47:00.000 --> 47:01.860
listen to me.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.530
Don't be alarmed...

47:04.560 --> 47:06.360
but I can't see a damn thing.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.300
(crying)
Shh, Bridgette.

47:10.330 --> 47:13.130
(phone ringing)
Sweetie, it was
just a bad dream.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.600
Sweetie, stop. You're
gonna make yourself sick.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.600
It's Scanlon.

47:19.630 --> 47:20.860
Hello?
Come here.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.900
SCANLON (on phone):
Allison, it happened again.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.030
They got the man of the house.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.330
He has a golf club.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.200
The Mom...

47:29.230 --> 47:30.360
In the hall, yeah.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.860
What about the baby?

47:32.900 --> 47:34.900
Did they get the baby?

47:34.930 --> 47:37.400
Yeah, they got the baby, too.

47:37.430 --> 47:39.150
How'd you know?

47:43.110 --> 47:44.610
Go to sleep, Joe.

47:44.650 --> 47:46.810
I can't go to sleep.

47:48.650 --> 47:50.650
He's not here.

47:51.650 --> 47:52.810
You don't know that.

47:54.310 --> 47:56.210
I don't see him.
I don't see him anywhere.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.510
I would tell you
if I did.

47:57.550 --> 47:59.450
But you're not
even looking.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.950
I don't see him.

48:03.980 --> 48:06.110
I swear.
Right.

48:06.150 --> 48:08.350
Uh-huh.
What, you don't
believe me?

48:08.380 --> 48:10.880
Allison, the man has
apparently been here

48:10.910 --> 48:12.280
for two whole days.

48:12.310 --> 48:13.650
Now, either you forgot

48:13.680 --> 48:15.610
to mention it or he
can choose when it is

48:15.650 --> 48:17.650
that you see him, and neither
of those two scenarios

48:17.680 --> 48:19.810
makes me particularly
comfortable.

48:19.850 --> 48:21.710
You know, you can
really be an ass.

48:21.750 --> 48:22.850
I didn't do this, Allison.

48:22.880 --> 48:24.310
I'm going to go sleep
in the girls' room.

48:24.350 --> 48:26.950
Go.
Holler if you see a ghost.

48:26.980 --> 48:28.710
Yeah, if you see a ghost,
remember:

48:28.750 --> 48:30.710
you're a married woman.

48:33.510 --> 48:36.150
Hey, "Allibaster."

48:36.180 --> 48:38.110
Your guy's got quite
the temper, huh?

48:38.150 --> 48:39.650
You think he has a temper?

48:39.680 --> 48:41.280
Shh, down, girl.

48:41.310 --> 48:44.480
How dare you--
camp out in my house?!

48:44.510 --> 48:46.480
Toy with my family,
toy with me,

48:46.510 --> 48:48.480
someone you claim to care about?

48:48.510 --> 48:49.650
I hate you.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.710
No, you don't.
Yes,

48:51.750 --> 48:54.150
I do and I need you
to leave my house.

48:54.180 --> 48:56.380
Funny how
things work out.

48:56.410 --> 48:58.180
You know, when we were in
school, I thought you were

48:58.210 --> 48:59.710
the smartest thing
on two legs.

48:59.750 --> 49:02.210
When we were in school,
I thought you were smug.

49:02.250 --> 49:05.450
And vain and selfish
and nice to look at

49:05.480 --> 49:06.950
and maybe, deep down,
had a heart.

49:06.980 --> 49:08.480
I guess I was wrong
about the heart.

49:08.510 --> 49:11.350
You know, he's mistaken
about you in there.

49:11.380 --> 49:13.280
Pissed off becomes you.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.710
Leave my house!

49:14.750 --> 49:16.750
Don't you think I
would, if I could?

49:16.780 --> 49:19.750
Well, maybe you just
have to try harder.

49:19.780 --> 49:22.210
Come on, you can do it.

49:22.250 --> 49:24.410
Find a light
and walk into it.

49:24.450 --> 49:26.250
You think it's just
a coincidence I ended up here,

49:26.280 --> 49:27.780
out of all the places
in all the world?

49:27.810 --> 49:29.410
Your house?

49:29.450 --> 49:32.150
You think it's an
accident you can see me?

49:32.150 --> 49:35.450
Hear me? I don't.

49:35.480 --> 49:38.050
I've been to a lot of places,
I've seen a lot of things.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.380
I don't believe in coincidence.

49:40.410 --> 49:41.910
I'm here for a reason...

49:41.950 --> 49:44.580
like it or not, baby.

49:44.610 --> 49:46.610
I think that
reason is you.

49:48.110 --> 49:50.750
Mommy, I got scared and I
thought I heard voices.

49:52.250 --> 49:54.950
It's just me, sweetie,
talking to myself.

49:54.980 --> 49:56.810
Did you have a bad dream?

49:56.850 --> 49:59.910
Uh... kind of.

49:59.910 --> 50:02.880
Do you want to come in my
bed and sleep with me?

50:02.910 --> 50:04.650
That might make it all better.

50:06.980 --> 50:08.580
If you don't mind.

50:08.610 --> 50:10.010
Okay, just this once.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.910
As long as we don't
make a habit out of it.

50:11.950 --> 50:14.010
(chuckles):
Okay.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.680
(beeping)
MAN:
Mr. Devalos.

50:19.710 --> 50:22.280
I'm going to shine a very bright
light into your eyes.

50:22.310 --> 50:23.550
I need you to tell me
if you see something.

50:23.580 --> 50:25.550
Anything.

50:25.580 --> 50:27.110
DEVALOS:
Uh, yeah.

50:27.150 --> 50:30.080
It's very blurry, but I can see.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.980
I see you and I see the room.

50:33.010 --> 50:34.580
And I can see you, Lilly.

50:34.610 --> 50:37.650
My best guess is
that we're looking
at a severe case

50:37.680 --> 50:39.580
of diabetic retinopathy.

50:39.610 --> 50:41.150
Blood sugar's
off the charts.

50:41.180 --> 50:43.080
You're lucky you
can see at all.

50:43.110 --> 50:44.680
You're lucky
you're conscious.

50:44.710 --> 50:45.950
DEVALOS:
What does this mean?

50:45.980 --> 50:47.610
Is this thing curable?

50:47.650 --> 50:48.950
It means we wait.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.250
Wait for that insulin
we're putting in you

50:51.280 --> 50:53.080
to hopefully start
doing its work.

50:53.110 --> 50:54.750
And wait for the
doctors who really

50:54.780 --> 50:55.910
know their way
around this stuff

50:55.950 --> 50:58.350
to get here, which
may be a little bit.

50:58.380 --> 50:59.810
It is 4:00 in the
morning, you know.

50:59.850 --> 51:01.480
LILLY:
But he's gonna be okay?

51:01.510 --> 51:03.650
We just have to hope the
damage isn't too great.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.610
Mr. Devalos...

51:06.650 --> 51:08.480
when was the last
time you saw a doctor?

51:09.710 --> 51:13.450
DEVALOS (sighing):
I honestly don't know.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.650
I really can't remember.

51:17.310 --> 51:19.880
I'm gonna shut
this light off.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.910
I suggest you
get some rest.

52:21.650 --> 52:23.950
Okay.
Mommy.

52:23.980 --> 52:25.350
I know.

52:25.380 --> 52:26.950
I saw it, too.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.580
It's okay, honey.

52:28.610 --> 52:30.180
It's okay,
it was just a cartoon.

52:30.210 --> 52:32.050
Okay? Shh.

52:38.700 --> 52:40.300
DEVALOS:
Hey.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.500
I can see you.

52:44.530 --> 52:46.930
Hey.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.600
I can see you, too.

52:48.630 --> 52:51.260
You look kind of soft and gauzy,

52:51.300 --> 52:54.230
kind of like an angel.

52:54.260 --> 52:57.200
Kind of like...

52:57.230 --> 52:58.860
we might be in heaven.

52:58.900 --> 53:00.260
We're not dead, are we?

53:00.300 --> 53:01.860
God, I hope not.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.030
I have a bunch of stuff I have
to pick up at the dry cleaners.

53:05.060 --> 53:07.330
If I'm dead,
Joe will never remember

53:07.360 --> 53:08.930
where I keep the tickets.

53:08.960 --> 53:12.430
What did you do?

53:12.460 --> 53:15.530
The dentist, the doctor, flying.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.300
Those are my three big demons.

53:19.330 --> 53:21.960
When I was a teenager,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.900
my... my mother

53:24.930 --> 53:27.600
worked in a department store
refolding merchandise

53:27.630 --> 53:29.960
at night after
everyone had gone home.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.400
She didn't even feel bad.

53:34.430 --> 53:36.530
Just a little pain
under her arm.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.330
Ignored it for the longest time.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.300
Store insisted she see someone.

53:43.330 --> 53:45.330
And then, six weeks later...

53:48.260 --> 53:51.760
I do believe that's
the last time I ever cried.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
Got a life's worth of tears out.

53:58.330 --> 53:59.500
You come all this way

53:59.530 --> 54:02.230
just to give me that
swell-looking balloon?

54:04.260 --> 54:06.630
Olga Bankova and her son
were run off the road

54:06.660 --> 54:10.300
by the same people who killed
the Costigan family last week,

54:10.330 --> 54:12.960
slaughtered the Milano family
last night.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.330
And you know this how?

54:15.360 --> 54:17.800
I know.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.330
We're still in the land
of cartoon people, right?

54:23.360 --> 54:26.300
I'd really like to see
where they lived,

54:26.330 --> 54:27.860
this boy and his mother.

54:27.900 --> 54:30.030
We've already had
a detective out there,

54:30.060 --> 54:32.060
but, sure, you're welcome
to take a look.

54:35.060 --> 54:36.130
Hey, hold on a second.

54:36.160 --> 54:38.260
Uh, thought you
were a friend.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.930
Gaze into your crystal ball.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.330
Give a sick man some hope.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.460
It just doesn't work that way.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.700
A lot of times,

54:50.730 --> 54:53.160
the people closest to me...

54:53.200 --> 54:56.760
I didn't even know you were ill.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.960
I do know
that your wife loves you.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.460
We passed
in the hall.

55:01.500 --> 55:04.200
She was going home to clean up,

55:04.230 --> 55:06.000
call relatives.

55:06.030 --> 55:08.800
It just poured off her.

55:08.830 --> 55:10.730
"I love this man.

55:10.760 --> 55:13.460
"I'm so angry at this man.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.660
"I love this man.

55:14.700 --> 55:17.700
I am so angry at this man."

55:26.530 --> 55:28.530
ALLISON:
Thank you.

55:37.130 --> 55:40.000
They smashed their way
through this door.

55:40.030 --> 55:42.500
Who, the cartoon bad guys?

55:42.530 --> 55:44.200
It's an old,
rotted doorjamb,

55:44.230 --> 55:46.430
an old, rotted door.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.900
If she didn't have it locked,
didn't have the chain on it,

55:48.930 --> 55:49.930
you could kick this open,

55:49.960 --> 55:52.000
we'd never even know.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.260
What is it we're
looking for again?

56:01.300 --> 56:04.960
I don't know, a reason why
killers who hit wealthy families

56:05.000 --> 56:06.700
for no reason at all
would also kill

56:06.730 --> 56:09.100
a substitute teacher
and her child.

56:14.480 --> 56:17.480
SCANLON:
Methinks the woman
liked to paint.

56:28.110 --> 56:28.680
Look at this.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.710
It looks like she's trying
to learn how to paint

56:30.750 --> 56:32.280
in the style
of this artist.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.250
Do these look familiar?

56:40.280 --> 56:42.710
Sure. I'd recognize
that squiggle anywhere.

56:42.750 --> 56:44.280
It's after
5:00, Allison.

56:44.310 --> 56:46.650
We've got at least a
two-hour drive back.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.550
Allison?

56:50.550 --> 56:54.210
The food court at the mall?

56:54.250 --> 56:56.510
You can have dinner
anywhere you want,

56:56.550 --> 56:59.250
and you want to have it
at the food court at the mall?

56:59.280 --> 57:01.810
Daddy, if you don't really
want to know, you shouldn't ask.

57:01.850 --> 57:03.810
What's wrong with the
food court at the mall?

57:03.850 --> 57:05.050
They have everything.

57:05.080 --> 57:07.210
They have food from
all over the world.

57:07.250 --> 57:10.110
Okay, the people have spoken.

57:10.150 --> 57:11.750
Let me just get
out of these clothes,

57:11.780 --> 57:13.580
and we'll head out to the mall.

57:13.610 --> 57:15.710
Yippee.

57:33.380 --> 57:34.450
Hello?

57:43.850 --> 57:45.850
She is my wife, you know.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.650
Mine.

57:52.680 --> 57:54.310
I know what you're thinking.

57:54.350 --> 57:57.010
You're thinking,
what am I gonna do, kill you?

57:59.710 --> 58:01.680
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

58:01.710 --> 58:03.310
But I will figure something out.

58:03.350 --> 58:07.210
I am gonna make your death

58:07.250 --> 58:10.210
more miserable than your life.

58:18.710 --> 58:20.510
She's mine.

58:25.710 --> 58:28.710
Hey, Ariel?

58:28.750 --> 58:30.750
Ariel, sweetie,
come here for a second.

58:35.210 --> 58:36.910
Hey, come here.
What are you doing?

58:36.950 --> 58:38.310
I thought you
were changing.

58:38.350 --> 58:40.810
I thought we were
going to the mall.
We are, we are.

58:40.850 --> 58:42.250
Just have a look
around the room.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.350
Okay.

58:43.380 --> 58:45.410
What am I
looking for?

58:45.450 --> 58:46.850
I don't know.
What do you see?

58:46.880 --> 58:49.550
Do you see anything?

58:49.580 --> 58:51.010
What are you
talking about?

58:51.050 --> 58:52.550
I see what you see.

58:52.580 --> 58:53.610
It's your room.

58:53.650 --> 58:56.110
It looks like your
room always looks.

58:56.150 --> 58:57.310
Are you okay?

58:57.350 --> 58:58.580
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just curious.

58:58.610 --> 59:00.280
So...

59:00.310 --> 59:03.650
there's nothing you see in here
that's out of the ordinary?

59:03.680 --> 59:04.850
I don't know.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.750
Did Mommy get a new
bedspread or something?

59:09.750 --> 59:11.280
Huh.

59:14.480 --> 59:15.680
It's the wind, Daddy.

59:20.380 --> 59:22.080
It's just the wind.

59:22.110 --> 59:24.310
Huh.

59:24.350 --> 59:25.610
I'm really hungry.

59:25.650 --> 59:27.250
We're all
really hungry.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.250
Yes, me, too.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.610
Come on.

59:29.650 --> 59:32.650
I'll change later.
Let's get out of here.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.050
Let's go.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.530
Look at this.
Together again.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.400
If we're here,
who's running the city?

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.760
Could you have picked
a more out of the way place?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.360
Yeah, pretty
obscure, huh?

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:20.080
May I start you off
with something to drink?

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:21.550
You on the clock?

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.110
I'll have a scotch
and soda.

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:26.850
The lady will have
a dirty martini.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.310
So, when last we spoke, uh...

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:30.650
DINOVI:
When last we spoke...

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.010
Where do I start?

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.710
Drinks... Lady from
the third district...

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.150
It went great.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.250
It's been 24 hours, and
I still don't believe it.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280
Believe what?

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.450
They want me to run
for city council.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:48.850
(exhales)
I should cancel the cocktails

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.280
and get us
a bottle of champagne.

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.510
Don't do that.
I've been dreaming

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:52.610
about a martini all day.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.910
A martini? Not me?

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.250
A martini and you.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.910
I was just

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.450
so completely
taken by surprise.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.250
Then they started hitting
me with questions.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.480
Questions?

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.510
"Where were you born?
Are you a native?

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:06.750
"Do you belong
to any clubs?

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.780
Are you involved
with anyone?"

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.080
You fess up?

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.110
I told them the truth.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.050
That, for all intents
and purposes, I'm...

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.780
You're at my house
one or two nights a week.

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:16.580
Well, no, I didn't
tell them that.

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:18.680
I don't think a woman
running for office

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.410
should be bragging about
making the walk of shame

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.680
from her lover's apartment to
her car at 6:30 in the morning,

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.550
praying that nobody sees her.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.150
Yeah, well...

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.810
...I want to talk to you
about that.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.580
No, it's okay.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:33.950
I realized something.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.480
I like what we have,
the way we have it.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.750
I wasn't sure
at first.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.180
Never been with someone who
didn't want to come home with me

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.980
to my folks at
Christmas, but...

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.980
but it's okay.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:47.210
It's actually good.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.250
One of the things these
people said to me was,

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.010
I guess a lot of the
union agreements--

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:56.010
police, fire, teachers--
they're all coming up next year.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:02:00.210
I mean, the last thing they
wanted to hear was that I'm--

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:04.480
whatever you call this thing we
have-- with a civil servant.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.050
Is that what I am,
a civil servant?

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.780
What? No.

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.210
That's their word.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.250
It's really just about...

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.510
I get the point.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:18.700
They don't want you
sleeping with the help.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:20.630
It's really just about
these negotiations.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.930
What did you say?

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.810
(cell phone ringing)
There was nothing to say.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.110
Got it.

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:33.480
I'll see you there.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.900
Wait a second.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.130
I thought we were having dinner.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.310
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:39.950
I'm just a civil servant.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.050
I get a call, I go to work.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.950
Lee...
What?

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.060
Hey, some people just got shot
to death in Hasbrook Heights.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.180
The mayor's back in town,

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.780
so you're not
getting the call,

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.210
but I'm just a working guy.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.210
Enjoy your drink; it's paid for.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.350
Are you hurt?

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.380
You don't even let me keep
a toothbrush at your place

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:01.380
and you're hurt?!

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.880
I'm not hurt.

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:03.880
I'm thrilled for you.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.980
You have my vote.

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:08.380
But I got to go.

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.810
Will the gentleman
be returning?

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:23.050
It's Scanlon.
He says it's important.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.850
You didn't have another
bad dream, did you?

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.480
Hello?

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:34.110
SCANLON:
You want the good news, the bad
news or the very bad news?

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:35.910
Just tell me
what's going on.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.410
(over phone):
Another home invasion.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:41.010
Only this time, the homeowner
was packing heat.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.950
Killed all three of them.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.180
I think it's over, Allison.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.880
I think it's all over.

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.380
Okay.

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:49.850
What about the very bad news?

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.580
Your boss is still
in the hospital.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:53.450
I need you to get dressed
and come downtown

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.180
and help me interrogate
the solid citizen

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.550
who gunned down
these three bastards.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.880
What is it, Mommy?

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.310
Who's on the phone?

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:00.680
Hold on.

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:01.680
It's the police, honey.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.450
They got the bad Monkeyheads.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.880
They're not gonna bother
anybody anymore.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.910
SCANLON:
Spell your name
for me, please.

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:10.450
Alan Gardner.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.950
G-A-R-D-N-E-R.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.450
And I should warn you,

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.710
I don't think
I'm actually sick, but I...

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.260
We know.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.330
We know that you've been through
a lot tonight.

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.250
The officer mentioned
that you've been throwing up.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.800
I think it's just nerves.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.630
I'm actually feeling
a little better right now.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.400
You want to tell
us what happened?

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:33.760
What happened...

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.300
I don't know...
I mean, I guess,

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.430
like everybody with a big
house, I've been on edge.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.560
It was the staff's
night off.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
I had been reading.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.160
Fell asleep in bed.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.260
Then the alarm went off.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.200
What did you do?

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:50.100
I ran into the closet.

01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.860
It's like a little
vault, actually--

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.230
fireproof.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.700
I keep some papers there,
antiquities, canvases.

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:00.430
I'm an art dealer.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.100
And I thought, well, I'll just
lock the door and stay in here.

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:04.730
I don't think they can
shoot through it.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.060
Like a panic room.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.060
Yeah.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.060
But small.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.160
And there's monitors in there.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.400
So I can see them moving
through the house.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.300
And I know the police
are trying to call.

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:16.600
And I thought for a moment,

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.360
I think I might actually
live through this thing.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.260
Then they shot Keezey.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:32.300
That little schnauzer
is the only family I have.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.800
I mean, you go through
the housebreaking,

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:41.860
the bladder infections,
the doggie tumors,

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.900
and you just never imagine...

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.260
Even on the
black-and-white monitor,

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.460
I can see him lying there,

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.900
the blood coming
out of his body.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.200
That's when I saw the gun...

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.660
the rifle, box of ammo...

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.400
I got it, like,
six years ago,

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:07.160
to go skeet shooting with
a client, which I hated.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.830
So much noise, and it...

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.830
hurt my shoulder.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.200
Then I went out
into the hall.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:22.660
The way the stairs work,
you can't see into the hall

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.200
unless you're at the top.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.460
And I just waited.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.700
(gunshots)

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.400
(gently):
Mr. Gardner?

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:46.930
I am a civilized person.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.660
I know they were killers.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.160
They killed my Keezey.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.860
But I just never imagined,
in the course of my life,

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.000
that I would actually
kill another man.

01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:01.530
Three other men.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:06.100
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.460
Look who's returning
to the marital bed.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.100
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.200
It's nice of you to
make an appearance.

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.560
It's, like, 5:00.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.900
Or five-oh-s...

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.360
...seven.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.060
I think it's really over.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.100
The home invaders are dead.

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:54.100
This meek little
art dealer shot them

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:58.130
'cause they killed his dog.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.200
Bridgette will be relieved.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.360
No more bad dreams.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.400
It's funny the way
stuff happens.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.000
I think your boyfriend's
gone, by the way.

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.600
ALLISON:
Oh, yeah?

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:18.500
JOE:
We had a chat.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.960
I mean, I had a chat.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.300
And I think
he heard it,

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.660
because I haven't felt
any cold breezes,

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.660
and he hasn't
been seen since.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.460
What do you mean?

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.200
Seen by who?
Who could see him?

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:33.300
He's a ghost.

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.700
I had Ariel take a
little look for him.

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:38.330
I mean, she didn't know

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:39.830
that that's who she
was looking for.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:41.830
You did not.
Yes...

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:47.700
I certainly did.

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:51.029
Did you think I was just gonna
give you up without a fight?

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.500
I love you with
all my heart.

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.160
You got it now?

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.229
You got it figured out?
'Cause I got to go.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:47.830
SCANLON:
Wow, what are you doing here?

01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:49.460
Aren't you the lady
who was with me

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.160
till almost 4:30 this morning?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.729
Shouldn't you be
at home sleeping?

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.730
I tried sleeping.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.530
I kept dreaming.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560
What about you?
Why aren't you home sleeping?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.660
I don't know.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.460
Phone kept ringing.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.760
You wanted to see me.
Is something up?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.260
It's like I said,
I keep having dreams.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.430
Yeah? So?

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.300
Isn't that kind of like Einstein
always having brainstorms?

01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:14.330
You recognize this?

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
Thought you said
you would

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.600
recognize this
squiggle anywhere.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.160
It's that painting Devalos
told us was so valuable,

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.630
that was hanging
at the first house.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:23.730
Okay.
Remember

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.630
those little paintings at Olga's
house I was looking at--

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.930
I told you they reminded me
of something?

01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:30.500
This is the painting
they remind me of.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:32.900
I'm glad we, uh,
solved that mystery.
I think she was

01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:35.360
trying to learn how to paint
in the style of this painter.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.430
I think she was trying to learn
to paint this painting.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.230
You think they killed her
for that?

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.830
How does that explain
the other killings?

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.730
How does that explain the home
invasions in two other states?

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.460
To be honest, I don't know.
I just...

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.400
Both those houses are still
crime scenes, right?

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:53.560
Could someone possibly

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.660
just bring me this painting?

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.260
Maybe all the little ones
I was looking at

01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.700
at Olga's house?
Allison, is it possible

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:02.030
that in all the hubbub last
night, that you missed the part

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.560
where the home invaders
were shot to death?

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.900
No, I heard that.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.800
Did you miss the part
where I said
(phone rings)

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.900
I was still having
dreams about it all?

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.300
So what do you think?

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:17.810
I think someone's in a mood.

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:19.380
Sorry.

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:22.680
A friend of mine who was
visiting left suddenly.

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.210
I guess...

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.150
I guess I wanted to say good-bye
more than I realized.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.380
Yeah, good-byes are
a bitch, aren't they.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:30.410
WOMAN:
How's your vision?

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.380
It's good.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:32.350
I can see perfectly.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.680
I feel good, too.

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.410
Frankly, Doctor, I feel ready
to get out of here.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:36.710
Ready to get back to work.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.580
Well, that's what's going
to kill you, you know.

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:39.710
How good you feel.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.410
You have diabetes,
Mr. District Attorney.

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.510
I think that you've probably
had it for years,

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:46.610
but you just didn't know.

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:48.450
It's a sneaky little bastard.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.080
If you're not checking for it,

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.550
it doesn't let you know it's
there until it's good and ready

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.550
to give you a stroke
or a heart attack,

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:56.760
make you impotent
or strike you blind.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.230
Are you trying to frighten me?

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.030
No, I am trying
to warn you.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.100
Now, I can see you
every three months.

01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:04.230
We can monitor this thing.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.500
I can teach you how to get
on top of it.

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.560
Or I can see you
in a couple of years.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.430
Now, if they manage to keep
you alive until you get

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.200
to the hospital,
well, then we can

01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:15.960
chat about how high on your leg
we need to amputate

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.660
or maybe
where the best Braille

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.860
classes are.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.960
Okay, so what
does this prove?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.030
You know, I don't know anything
about this stuff, Allison.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.500
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:40.760
But I know someone who does.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.400
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:43.560
I'm heading out to Carefree.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.260
Paying a visit to Alan Gardner.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.260
That gallery owner who shot
those three home invaders.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.630
Are you okay to drive?

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:52.130
What'd you get,
about 15 minutes sleep?

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.700
No, I'm fine.

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.130
I'm not going to be there long.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.030
I've just have a couple
paintings in the car

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.130
I asked him to take a look at.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.860
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.500
Hmm? Sure.

01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:05.000
What did you say to him?

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.630
What are you talking about?

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.630
To Clay. Last night.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.060
You know what?

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.000
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
It was silly.

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:17.760
I'm sure that
there was nobody there.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.400
Okay. But what did you say
to him?

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.530
Hello?

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:30.900
CLAY:
He said, "She's mine."

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:34.800
He said everything
you'd want him to say.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.800
He said everything
you'd hoped he'd say,

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.430
if some crazy numbskull
showed up on your doorstep

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.460
with the idea that maybe
he could have you back.

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.330
Sorry. I-I lost you.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.430
Yeah, well, um, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.130
I don't know, exactly,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.600
what I said, and I really
don't think it matters.

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:04.830
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.800
I mean, I don't know what I was
getting so worked up about.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.800
After all... I'm here.

01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:15.200
Till death do us part.

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.600
Yes.

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:19.430
And who knows.
Maybe longer.

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.130
I'll see you when I get home.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.960
I will see you
when you get home.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.260
He's a good man.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:37.260
I know.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.860
I was wrong
about why I'm here.

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.560
And you were right.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.530
And I am smug, vain, selfish...

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.230
even in death.

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.830
None of this has anything
to do with me.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.460
I finally figured that out
last night.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.230
I'm not here to woo you.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.830
I'm here to help you.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.060
To tell you something

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.560
that you otherwise
wouldn't know.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.160
To redeem myself.

01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:12.830
And then, Allison,
I think I'll be on my way.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.360
You sent me that dream
last night, didn't you?

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.400
The one with

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.730
the cartoon?

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.300
I know where you're going.

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.930
And I know what you're
about to do.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.660
And I know how it all ends up.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.830
But I need to get you
to do something first.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:41.660
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.000
Mr. District Attorney,

01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:44.800
I'd like to introduce
you to Alan Gardner.

01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:46.360
The gentleman who
single-handedly stopped

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.660
those three ruthless
home invaders.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.930
This is an honor,

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.900
sir.
No, it's an honor
meeting you, sir.

01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:52.200
Please.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:55.000
I apologize for not being made
available to you sooner.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.500
I was a bit
under the weather.

01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:58.960
But I just wanted you to know
that this office stands ready

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.060
to help you navigate whatever
legal hurdles your

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.230
extraordinarily brave actions

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.730
may have created
for you.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.960
Oh.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.110
Should I have brought

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.250
my lawyer?

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.010
Both the detective

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:12.280
and Mrs. Dubois,
the other night,

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:13.580
seemed to indicate
that... that...

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:14.910
That shooting
three people to death

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.310
to protect one's own life

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.650
is a perfectly justifiable
course of action? Absolutely.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.950
So long as you can prove
that you were in mortal

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.850
danger, you have nothing to fear
from the justice system.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.110
Well, is there any doubt
about that?

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:28.580
Doubts? No.

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:30.410
No doubts, but questions.

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:31.980
There are always questions.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:33.850
There's quite a lot

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.880
of valuable art in your
home, isn't there, sir.

01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:37.280
I own two art galleries.

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:39.050
Of course there's art
in my home.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.380
You may have heard,
in addition to your home,

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:44.310
and the two others in the
Phoenix area, two others

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.880
in the Southwest were also hit.
Guess what they all had

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:48.710
in common?
Every family that was

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.850
targeted, owned at least
one major work of art.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.050
But I-I don't understand.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.310
I thought I read that
nothing had been taken from

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:56.850
the homes.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.450
The papers never mentioned
anything about art being stolen.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.380
And it appears that none had,
but then...

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.010
Mrs. Dubois here
developed a theory.

01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:05.950
Well, what if you could find
someone who could paint

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.850
near-perfect copies
of modern masterpieces?

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.250
You go into a home.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.610
You massacre everyone
who lives there.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.710
You replace the authentic
painting with the fake.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:21.010
Then while everyone is consumed
with the grief and horror

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:24.080
you quietly sell the priceless
originals to wealthy collectors

01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:25.310
in the Middle East and Asia.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.480
Wow.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:30.180
You think that's
what's been going on?

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.660
Well, that's the reason

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.780
I brought that painting to you
yesterday.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.850
It came from the Costigan home
after the massacre.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.010
I was really hoping
to get your expert opinion

01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:41.780
as to its authenticity.

01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:43.210
Well, I'll sign anything.

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:45.380
And happily testify under oath,
the painting you showed me,

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.550
the one you said came
from the Costigan home,

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.810
that's absolutely an original
Armand Vartanian.

01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:52.850
Easily worth at least
a million dollars.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.710
Maybe twice that, depending
on the appetite of the buyer.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:57.910
So much for your theory.

01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.650
So you would be
willing to sign

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.910
a sworn statement

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:04.710
vouching for the painting's
authenticity?

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.980
Well, I'd have no choice.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.710
Sorry about that.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:19.680
Mm.
I appreciate this.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.130
And let me present you
with this.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.700
And this is?
That...

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:28.200
that's a search warrant.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:31.830
Actually, the detectives should
be arriving at your house

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.100
right about now.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:34.730
To look for what?

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.930
That painting
that I brought you yesterday--

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.500
an old friend suggested,
before I gave it to you,

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:42.560
that I mark it in some way.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.160
So, on the back,
where it would do no damage,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.860
I wrote the initials, "C.B."

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.830
in indelible marker.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.560
That is the painting
that you gave back to me.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.130
And, yes, it's the real
actual painting.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.930
But it's not the painting
I brought to your house.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160
No initials.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.100
The painting

01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:14.260
I brought to your house was the
one you had Olga Bankova paint.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.830
What are you suggesting?

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:20.360
What are...
What are you talking about?

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400
Those home invaders

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.560
worked for you,
Mr. Gardner.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.760
So did Olga.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.560
Although we're fairly
certain she had

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.960
no idea what she vas involved
in until it was too late.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.100
When you realized I was going
to pay you a visit,

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:32.730
you thought I might be
on to something.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.630
So you gave me
the authentic painting

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.030
to throw me off the scent.

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.860
This is preposterous.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.300
DEVALOS:
Really?

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.600
What about the part where you
suggested to your hired killers

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:45.130
that you needed them
to hit one more home-- yours.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.630
But, unlike everyone else,

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.660
you weren't surprised when they
showed up-- you were waiting.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360
You can't prove that.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.100
Oh, I think we can.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:56.360
What was your story--

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.900
waiting at the top
of the stairs?

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:00.060
We think maybe you were
hiding at the bottom.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:02.230
DEVALOS:
According to ballistics,

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.900
you shot those men in the back.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.060
Your dog, too.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.230
Now, if you'll

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.830
excuse us, I need to give myself
a little insulin shot

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:12.260
and I'd love a word with you.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.360
Detective, read this
man his rights.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.460
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.260
Anything you say
can and will be

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.930
(in distance):
used against you
in a court of law.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.700
Nice work, Allison.
I mean that.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.600
I'd like to think
if I'd been feeling better

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.900
I might have listened
more and sooner.

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:32.100
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.430
It wasn't just me;
I had a lot of help.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.460
Yeah, I know,
your daughter.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.460
The cartoons.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.430
Yeah, and an old friend.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:41.060
Well, thank him for me, too.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.330
Yeah, well, if I see him,
I will.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.060
ALLISON:
Some say sleep is the death
of each day's life.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.600
But I say sleep is the gateway
to our dreams.

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:57.400
And our dreams are the map
of our humanity.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:00.560
Ever watch a child sleep?

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.160
They almost always smile.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.200
They know what's coming.

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.730
And adults?

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.260
Ever notice how we try to tidy
up our lives just before bed?

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.200
Did you take your pills?

01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:21.160
Check your sugar?

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.330
You die on me, I'll
never forgive you.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.400
Don't worry.

01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:36.130
I'm not going anywhere.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.960
Or what a disappointment it is

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.700
when we're lurched out
of our sleep,

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.800
(phone rings)
or our dreams,
by something unexpected.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.200
Scanlon.

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.160
Hi.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.300
Who is it?
Is it work?

01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:02.200
Uh...
Want me to go?

01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:04.230
No. It's okay.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.630
It's nothing. Wrong number.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.260
Hey, Al.

01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:31.860
Allibaster.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.900
You know what I heard?

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:37.430
That if I want it bad enough...

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.900
if I try hard enough...

01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.460
sometimes, someone like me...

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.130
can actually be felt...

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.400
by someone like you.

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:52.860
A great man once said,

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.160
"If a little dreaming
is dangerous,

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.100
"the cure for it
is not to dream less...

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:01.460
but to dream more."

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.760
Did you think I was just going
to give up

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.730
and let you dream this dream
without a fight?

01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:16.910
Dream all the time.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:20.110
Yeah, I'm for that.

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:28.650
