00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:06.131
Gina doesn't want me.
Henry doesn't want you.

00:06.589 --> 00:07.590
We're leftovers.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.426
I happen to be in love with Gina, Fay.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.928
Love? Is that what they're
calling it these days, Henry?

00:12.012 --> 00:16.182
I haven't had time to do a whole lot
in the way of decorating yet.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.600
That's perfectly understandable.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.980
Get behind my funding request
for the SEVM prototype.

00:22.063 --> 00:25.191
Now, that's the
Strategic Entry Vehicle Modification.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.318
Yeah, I know about it,
and I don't want us behind it, Howard.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.528
I don't want us anywhere near it.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.116
RENKO: Mick?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.618
-(indistinct shouting)
-Mick! Get out of here, Mick!

00:35.702 --> 00:37.120
-(clattering)
-(screams)

00:37.203 --> 00:40.040
-HUNTER:<i> This is the police!</i>
-We're the police!

00:40.123 --> 00:45.295
What I'd like to do is suggest
we all go out to dinner tonight.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.212
Are you nuts?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.214
I know why you didn't like me.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.134
Why, because you're young
and beautiful and rich?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.385
-(glass clinking)
-Whoa!

00:52.469 --> 00:53.803
-Hey.
-FAY: Watch it!

00:54.471 --> 00:56.473
-(gunshots)
-(screaming)

00:57.515 --> 00:58.808
(clattering)

01:02.979 --> 01:07.108
Item 11, starting today,
I'm asking all sector-C patrols

01:07.192 --> 01:10.487
to include the lots next to the
Case and Western freight yards

01:10.570 --> 01:11.529
on their pass-bys.

01:11.613 --> 01:15.033
Seems we got a Hooverville all of our own
springing up over there.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.411
People living in storage cases,
boxes, all kinds of things.

01:18.578 --> 01:22.332
Also, we're getting incident reports
from the neighborhood merchants.

01:22.415 --> 01:26.419
So that's continuing
until otherwise notified, okay?

01:26.503 --> 01:29.881
All sector-C patrols.
Item 12, undercovers.

01:29.964 --> 01:34.511
Detective Belker is at Hal's 3-hour French
cleaners and tailors over on Rosemont,

01:34.594 --> 01:38.014
which we've pegged for moving warm
and counterfeit-labeled garments.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.851
Also, Detectives Mayo
and Garibaldi continue prep

01:42.102 --> 01:43.895
on Operation Salsa,

01:44.395 --> 01:47.524
false documentation sales to aliens.

01:47.941 --> 01:52.695
Item 13 is an attaboy
to Sergeant Lucille Bates,

01:52.779 --> 01:56.783
who spotted famed purse snatcher
Virgil "Road Runner" Lentson

01:56.866 --> 02:00.036
four storefronts. She still beat him
to the Stinson overpass.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.206
(all cheering, applauding)

02:03.289 --> 02:06.126
The only-- the only casualty
of this collar being

02:06.209 --> 02:07.961
that the sarge turned her ankle.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.672
-ALL: Oh!
-So because of her temporary layup,

02:11.422 --> 02:13.967
-Jablonski is coming out of mothballs.
-OFFICER 1: What?

02:14.175 --> 02:17.428
Yeah, Sergeant Bates is gonna be
running the squad room today,

02:17.512 --> 02:20.974
and yours truly is gonna be riding
with Joe Coffey.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.226
(clamoring)

02:23.309 --> 02:25.895
RUDY: Hey! They recommissioned
the<i> New Jersey, </i>didn't they?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.313
Yeah, and it sank.

02:28.690 --> 02:34.279
Item 14, Lieutenants Calletano and Hunter
take their captaincy exams today.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.947
I know that we all wish them well.

02:36.030 --> 02:40.660
And Item 15 is a welcome
to Detective Phil Dugan over there,

02:40.743 --> 02:41.953
center back of the room.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.123
Now, Detective Dugan
is a transfer from Midtown.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.668
He's gonna be working warrants
with LaRue and Washington

02:48.751 --> 02:50.420
until we can make a permanent pairing.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.631
Welcome to the Hill, Detective.
Okay, that's it.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.425
-Let's get out there.
-Excuse me, Sergeant.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.594
-STAN: What?
-Can we hold it a moment, please?

02:58.761 --> 03:02.223
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Uh... this is from Division.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.935
"In accordance with the terms
of the PBA Contract Agreement,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.938
"the shift of this precinct
has been selected at random

03:09.439 --> 03:11.149
"for drug toxicity testing.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.234
"Please make urine samples available

03:13.318 --> 03:16.112
"to the medical technicians
who are stationed upstairs

03:16.404 --> 03:19.282
-for collection and analysis."
-(clamoring)

03:19.365 --> 03:21.284
Okay, that's it.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.662
Let's go upstairs.
Let's, uh... let's urinate.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.081
Uh... let's, uh, let's have a good shift.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.927
-You know why I didn't call, Patsy?
-'Cause you're a bum.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.721
'Cause I'm a bum.
You know it's "eat with a bum" week?

03:43.014 --> 03:43.890
I don't think so.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.226
Come on, forgive me.
You'll be a better person.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.312
See? You're feeling better!
You're letting it go.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.442
"...will submit to testing
for a controlled or illegal substance

03:54.525 --> 03:56.444
as deemed appropriate by Command."

03:56.861 --> 03:58.071
MAN: Have asparagus last night, Raymondo?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.697
BOBBY: Yeah, let me see that.
Let me take a look at that.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.783
Fill and cap this, please,
and return it to me.

04:01.866 --> 04:02.700
Just peachy.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.702
They're saying that
they don't need cause, right?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.162
They can just ask us out of thin air.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.164
I always thought
"deemed appropriate action"

04:08.248 --> 04:09.707
was when you come in with your eyeballs

04:09.791 --> 04:12.335
-swimming around your head like this.
-(laughs)

04:12.418 --> 04:15.296
I'm gonna talk to my law professor.
I don't think they can do this.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.257
-Jablonski, S.
-MAN: Thank you.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.634
-Let's hit the street, Joseph!
-Right away, Sarge.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.636
Fill and cap this and return it to me.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.013
Listen, you think you could
red-light the guys behind me

04:24.097 --> 04:25.848
-till I come out?
-Excuse me?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.350
LaRue, J.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.103
-And if--
-I have--

04:30.186 --> 04:31.854
Come on, Joe. Let's not make it more
of a production than it already is.

04:31.938 --> 04:32.772
Still nothing?

04:32.855 --> 04:34.190
HENRY: You know something,
Detective Torriello?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.818
I think you're lying.
You've got more than you're telling me.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.236
I think if you don't have more
after three weeks,

04:38.319 --> 04:40.113
-you're a lousy excuse for a cop.
-Henry.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.614
-Right with you.
-Now!

04:43.241 --> 04:45.368
Listen, I want you to call me
this afternoon, Detective.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.454
Not if you get anything!
I want you to call me either way.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.291
What?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.959
You're gonna have to stop
harassing Midtown.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.753
It's like the murder never happened.
Gina's dead three weeks.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.380
I don't even know
where they're taking the investigation.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.133
That's policy, and you know it.
Look, I know you're hurting--

05:00.216 --> 05:03.136
-Save the goo. Am I doing my job?
-That's not the point.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.512
It's the only point
you get to make, Frank.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.639
I'm doing my job.
You leave the rest of it the hell alone.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.977
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:12.687
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:12.770 --> 05:16.524
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:16.607 --> 05:18.318
(sirens wailing)

05:23.823 --> 05:26.409
(theme music playing)

06:56.833 --> 06:59.210
-MAN: Fill it to the line and cap it.
-Bates, Lucille.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.838
Sarge, how come you're not out
of here on the street yet?

07:01.921 --> 07:05.049
Joe's having trouble relieving himself.
He's loading up the tank.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.178
Howard, Howard, whatever our differences,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.431
I wish you only good luck
in the interview.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.434
(chuckles) Well,<i> buena suerte</i>
back to you, Raymondo.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.394
These are as many of the questions
I could remember

07:16.477 --> 07:18.938
from earlier interviews.
Feel free to look at them.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.649
Judas, this goes back
to the Carter administration.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.568
I just got off the phone
with my law professor,

07:23.651 --> 07:24.944
and he says this urinalysis thing

07:25.027 --> 07:26.988
is in violation of our
Fifth Amendment rights.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.906
Agreement to test is in the PBA contract.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.450
What? I mean, a cop is not a citizen?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.326
A cop has less rights than a citizen?
Come on, Captain!

07:32.410 --> 07:33.703
I think it's a good directive.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.371
If cops are using,
Command ought to know about it.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.291
Okay, but they can't just come in
here at any time they want--

07:38.374 --> 07:40.042
You're barking up the wrong tree, Harry.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.962
Oh, that's great. Welcome to Russia.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.215
Think we can move Joe Biomonte's warrant
to the head of the class, fellas?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.842
Case comes up
with the grand jury tomorrow.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.136
Hey, look. We've been trying Biomonte
for six weeks now.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.221
Now, the guy, he knows he's hot.
He's hiding.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.432
Simple, friendly inquiry, Detective.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.560
-Everyone give?
-Cup and a half.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.812
Waiting for the line to shorten up.
What'd your teacher say, Harry?

07:59.896 --> 08:02.315
That it's probably illegal.
Furillo isn't interested.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.733
I got to make a phone call.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.443
-Neal, you okay?
-Yeah.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.654
Isn't this lame? Doesn't this stink?

08:09.697 --> 08:10.531
You know what we ought to do, J.D.?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.992
We ought to play a joke on them
and mix up our whiz.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.786
Party down a little heavy
last night, Harry?

08:17.163 --> 08:20.917
Great timing.
I'm with a hippy-dip stewardess.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.585
I take three tokes of reefer.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.421
Is there any way you can
help me out, J.D.?

08:27.131 --> 08:27.965
What's the matter?

08:28.716 --> 08:31.135
We're gonna have to bring in
Henry Goldblume from the cold

08:31.219 --> 08:32.595
on the Sgrignoli killing
pretty soon, Irwin.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.223
-He's a loose cannon.
-Then tell him that.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.599
Tell him there's been progress,

08:36.682 --> 08:38.351
but he hasn't been cleared
for the particulars.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.102
And have him go totally renegade?

08:40.436 --> 08:42.188
Frank, we know he's running a separate
investigation right now.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.564
FRANK: Then how much longer?

08:43.981 --> 08:45.691
We're still working on
some of the things--

08:45.775 --> 08:46.692
How long, Irwin?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.946
I don't know. It goes a lot of places.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.782
I saw Phil Dugan's on the transfer list.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.116
What about him?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.327
His name came up
in the Keenan investigation,

08:56.410 --> 08:58.663
-but it didn't go anywhere.
-FRANK: It came up how?

08:58.788 --> 09:02.667
Uh, Keenan was Dugan's rabbi.
It didn't go anyplace.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.962
I know Henry's your friend.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.880
I know what it must
feel like stonewalling.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.299
When it's over, I'll run it for him myself

09:10.383 --> 09:11.467
chapter and verse.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.849
I got your sample.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.311
There's going and there's going.
I got to make number two.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.813
Yeah, what do we do with this thing?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.398
Fill it to the line, seal it,
return it to me.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.399
Okay, got you.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.902
-(toilet flushing)
-(Joe sighs)

09:33.447 --> 09:34.365
Hey, Joe.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.494
You believe this? This is so humiliating.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
-J.D.?
-J.D.: Standing by.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.499
Coming over.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.627
Any progress?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.297
Sarge, I think it's coming any second now.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.756
HARRY (whispers): J.D.? J.D.!

09:56.429 --> 09:57.722
What's going on over there?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.142
Nothing, Sarge.
J.D. just forgot his bottle.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.811
J.D. was in here before. He went with me.

10:04.937 --> 10:05.980
What are you two doing?

10:06.063 --> 10:08.274
We figured we'd play a little joke
on them, Sarge.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.319
-LaRue!
-J.D.: Sarge.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.945
Give me that container.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.574
Out!

10:19.118 --> 10:20.036
Over there.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.294
Go. You too.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.212
(zipper unzips)

10:32.131 --> 10:33.007
(sighs)

10:39.639 --> 10:44.018
Lieutenant, would you say that
you were the guiding force

10:44.101 --> 10:48.064
behind fielding that battering ram
for use in drug arrests?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.983
(chuckles) Well, I weren't agin' it.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.653
Well, Chief Daniels
"weren't agin' it," either.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.198
Oh, I call Chief Daniels' support
farsighted and paramount.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
WARREN: Uh,
how'd your captain feel about it?

11:00.034 --> 11:05.206
Well, Captain Furillo was not a fan
of this particular acquisition.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.334
Pulled a little end run around
Captain Furillo, Lieutenant?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.753
Well, I don't know
if I'd call it an end run.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.172
WARREN: He, uh, he didn't want it.
You knew you were right.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.050
Showed a little initiative,
went right to the chief.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.595
Well, gentlemen,
I take a back seat to no one

11:20.012 --> 11:24.350
in my personal and professional admiration
of Captain Furillo.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.645
I think if the captain
has a single blind spot

11:27.728 --> 11:29.188
in his professional outlook,

11:29.271 --> 11:33.275
it may be in staying absolutely
current on hardware.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.405
I'm proud to say that in that area,

11:38.531 --> 11:41.784
I am the captain's eyes.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.665
Oh, I didn't mean to hog, fellas.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.458
I think I've got enough.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.963
-That's it?
-Thank you, Lieutenant.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.424
It's my pleasure, gentlemen.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.977
How did it go, Howard?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.398
-Aced it.
-WARREN: Lieutenant Calletano?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.611
-Ah, Lieutenant. Come in, have a seat.
-(glass pouring)

12:17.695 --> 12:20.865
You know, uh,
Captain Leder, Captain Wilson.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.950
How do you do? How do you do?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.746
-Would you like some water?
-Thank you, no.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.042
I have an opening statement
I would like to make.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.463
(Ray clears throat)

12:40.426 --> 12:42.261
I want this job very much.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.518
Is it better if I don't read
an opening statement?

12:50.394 --> 12:55.649
It's a-- it's a bit unusual, Lieutenant,
but, uh, that's your choice.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.567
It's all right.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.285
No. Please begin with the questions.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.209
-Thank you. I think I will.
-(glass pouring)

13:13.292 --> 13:15.252
-(clattering)
-Oh, I'm sorry!

13:15.628 --> 13:18.881
-I'm terribly sorry!
-Uh, that's all right, Lieutenant.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.217
It's-it's all right. It-it missed me.
Don't worry.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.511
Lieutenant, sit down, relax. Okay?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.980
(water splashing)

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
(siren wailing)

13:37.107 --> 13:38.067
(tires screeching)

13:39.985 --> 13:42.863
Tie up my telephone.
I let you use my toilet all the time

13:42.947 --> 13:44.156
at the end of my busy night.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.700
I gotta bag my garbage up
at 7:00 in the morning!

13:46.784 --> 13:48.536
Here. Here comes the cops now.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.498
You tell those buddies
in Boxtown that you messed with.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.542
Police officers! Put the gun down!

13:55.125 --> 13:56.335
-Here.
-Put it down!

13:56.418 --> 13:58.087
Yeah, you're gonna get shot or busted.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.005
All right. Let him alone! Let him alone!

14:00.673 --> 14:02.925
He robbed me! He stole my papers!

14:03.008 --> 14:04.385
You got a permit for this thing?
Get it out.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.845
Yeah, I got a permit.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.680
Get the change off him.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.849
Whatever change he's got
in his pocket is mine.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.892
Forty cents of this is mine!

14:11.976 --> 14:14.019
All right, just calm down.
I'm just checking for a weapon, all right?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
I got 40 cents from the aluminum.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.941
If you're gonna take me in,
at least let me take it to my wife.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.110
-You better calm down.
-She ain't got no money, man!

14:21.193 --> 14:23.612
She all by herself.
I got four little kids.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.197
How many papers did he steal?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.950
Uh, look at 'em. He broke in there.
He took them all before I got here.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.452
How many papers did he steal?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.913
-Twelve. He got 12 of 'em.
-Twelve. That's three dollars.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.791
-You want to press charges? Three dollars.
-Hell, yes, man!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.710
-These people from Boxville...
-(groans)

14:37.793 --> 14:40.129
...they been breaking in,
robbing and doing everything.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.090
She's by herself. She ain't got no money.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.259
All right,
we'll just do it as fast as we can.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.136
Come along with me, Mr. Sodowski.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.638
-I got to lose time now?
-RENKO: Yes, you do.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.098
And let me tell you one more thing,

14:51.181 --> 14:54.476
if you shoot an individual on a petty,
little crime like this,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.937
there ain't no way
the police are gonna protect you.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.565
You are gone! Now come on!

15:09.867 --> 15:10.910
I'm shy, okay?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.329
I can't just go on command.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.916
Ah, forget about it, Joe.
People got their quirks.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.667
Yeah, now everybody knows mine.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.336
You know what I do?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.255
I imagine a bowling ball
rolling down an alley.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.174
Gets me started every time.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.012
Educate me, Joe.
Where are the action joints?

15:30.304 --> 15:31.555
See the chicken-and-rib place?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.681
-Yeah.
-Numbers.

15:33.515 --> 15:37.061
(chuckles) They can carry on all they like
about drugs and prostitution.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.564
I still say policy is money-maker
number one with the wise guys.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.816
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Any unit vicinity 112th and Jerome.</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:44.777
<i>Robbery in progress. Corales Mini Mart.</i>

15:44.860 --> 15:46.695
-Unit 2203 responding.
-(siren wailing)

15:46.779 --> 15:48.614
WOMAN:<i> Roger 2203, code three.</i>

15:48.697 --> 15:51.909
-(siren wails)
-(tires screeching)

15:58.874 --> 16:01.627
-(pounds)
-That-that's crazy. Back up.

16:02.544 --> 16:06.799
-(tires screeching)
-(siren wailing)

16:23.065 --> 16:23.899
(rattling)

16:24.775 --> 16:25.693
(groans)

16:47.214 --> 16:48.090
MAN: Catch him!

16:50.217 --> 16:51.677
Thief! Thief!

16:53.095 --> 16:54.972
-That's enough!
-I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

16:55.055 --> 16:57.516
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You pipe down already!

16:58.475 --> 17:00.060
-You all right, Sarge?
-Yeah.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.938
-Kick him! Kick him!
-Secure the suspect.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.941
JOE: Hey! I'm gonna pop you, too!
Now shut up!

17:06.817 --> 17:09.486
You pop me, I pop him. I pop him good!

17:10.529 --> 17:12.031
Got to get you running some
wind sprints, Sarge.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.324
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.424
Good Lord Almighty,
will you look at this mess?

17:30.507 --> 17:31.759
Look at these people.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.012
Yeah, I know.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.099
Excuse me, uh, are you Mrs. Jackson?

17:42.019 --> 17:42.936
On top.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.358
Jackson? Mrs. Jackson?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.947
-You Mrs. Jackson?
-What happened to Pablo?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.742
Nothing happened, ma'am.
He didn't get hurt or anything.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.078
But he's, uh, under arrest
down at Hill Street.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.370
What he do?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.207
Ma'am, he's accused
of stealing some newspapers.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.919
He asked us to come down and tell you.
He said he'd try to make it back tonight.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.837
Will they let him out?

18:09.296 --> 18:12.591
We don't know that yet, ma'am.
It depends whether they set bail or not.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.928
Ma'am, if he can't get out,
I think maybe you should get the kids

18:16.011 --> 18:18.180
and-and take them down
to the city shelter.

18:19.431 --> 18:23.268
-Well, he said that he didn't want you--
-(train rumbles)

18:23.352 --> 18:25.896
He didn't want you down here by yourself.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.191
No, no, no, they'll...
they'll take my children from me.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.485
-They separate the families there.
-BOBBY: Ma'am, you don't understand.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.653
Mr. Jackson doesn't want you
down here alone.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.656
We paid our rent first of every month,
and we still got evicted!

18:35.739 --> 18:37.699
The man we paid didn't pay the landlord.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.202
We ain't got no address.
We can't get no welfare check.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.037
No check, I can't get my man out.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.665
Now we ain't done nothing wrong!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.209
We ain't done nothing wrong!
This isn't right!

18:47.835 --> 18:48.710
Come on.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.343
-Come on.
-(mumbling)

18:57.886 --> 18:59.888
Davenport, I believe these
intake files are yours.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.891
Hey, it's got to be your computers.
I'm telling you I paid those tickets!

19:02.975 --> 19:05.018
All right, this is good.
Then we'll straighten it out.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.478
Leo, traffic warrants.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.938
Let's take a shot at this Biomonte.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.606
Hey, we told you the guy
went underground, Phil.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.608
Then we'll blow some smoke up his tunnel.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.070
-Uh, Miss Davenport?
-JOYCE: Officers?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.614
Have you done an intake yet
on a Pablo Jackson?

19:18.323 --> 19:19.241
Second on my list.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.369
Can you take a quick look and see
if they might release on recognizance?

19:23.745 --> 19:25.080
-No address.
-That's because--

19:25.164 --> 19:27.541
Well, he doesn't have a permanent address
'cause he got evicted.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.669
And then the man they gave the money
to was a lessor, and he didn't turn it in.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.546
And then they got cut off welfare.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.632
And now he's living out
in Boxville by the tracks,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.342
with his wife and four children.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.345
The theft is a small amount,
but without an address,

19:40.429 --> 19:43.056
I think the probation department
will probably recommend bail

19:43.140 --> 19:44.433
instead of OR release.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.312
-Can't save the world.
-Sometimes you can't even flag it down.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.191
-I'll push hard for the OR.
-Thanks, ma'am.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.734
(clamoring)

19:53.817 --> 19:56.361
Well, look at this.
Sarge got himself a great big perp!

19:56.445 --> 19:59.323
-I was just a spectator.
-Malarkey! He was great.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.532
Hey, Joe.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.077
-(imitates water running)
-That's not funny, Renko.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.498
-What have you got, Lonnie?
-More goose eggs, Lieutenant.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.751
-Nobody's got nothing on that hit.
-Stay on it.

20:11.001 --> 20:14.004
I'm telling you, it was an outfit whack.
Out-of-town talent.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.840
-Stay on it.
-I feel bad taking your bread, Lieutenant.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.176
Fay, what's this note?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.553
"Does Mrs. Furillo want to reschedule?"

20:21.637 --> 20:23.222
You canceled the appointment
with the hypnotist?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.141
Hi, Henry.
And, yes, I canceled the appointment

20:26.225 --> 20:28.518
-that you made without telling me.
-HENRY: Fay.

20:28.602 --> 20:33.065
Henry, I am not going under anymore.
It didn't work the first time.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.358
I didn't come up with a single thing

20:34.441 --> 20:36.068
about the shooting that
I hadn't already remembered.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.779
And once is your limit.
That's as far as you'll go to find a guy

20:38.862 --> 20:40.405
who guns down a woman
at your dinner table?

20:41.281 --> 20:44.743
Whether you realize it or not,
the shooting was traumatic for me, too.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.621
I know how painful this is for you,

20:49.039 --> 20:50.415
but I think it's time you asked yourself

20:50.499 --> 20:53.502
whether this one-man crusade of yours
wasn't getting obsessive.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.629
I've got too many other
questions to ask, Fay.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.050
-FAY: Hi, Harry.
-Hi, Mrs. Furillo.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.886
Mrs. Furillo?
I mean, just because we stopped dating,

21:02.970 --> 21:04.513
it doesn't have to be Mrs. Furillo.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.597
I'm sorry, Fay.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.433
-(Fay gasps) Oh!
-Oh!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.605
-Would you watch where you're going?
-MAN: Right, sorry.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.942
PHIL: No, I'm not kidding!

21:18.026 --> 21:22.030
Every year, we draw four names
from the flight manifests

21:22.114 --> 21:22.990
to Las Vegas.

21:23.865 --> 21:27.202
Was your husband in Vegas
the past 12 months, Mrs. Biomonte?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.707
We draw the winners,
and we bring them on our sister ships

21:31.790 --> 21:33.542
the<i> Shasta, </i>and the<i> McKinley.</i>

21:33.834 --> 21:35.544
See, we want people
to find out for themselves.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.962
There's nothing they can do in Vegas

21:37.045 --> 21:41.633
they can't do on our luxurious ships,
with the full casinos.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.303
And plus, we got the ocean.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.516
Ma'am, he won five grand
and a 21-day cruise. That's correct.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.394
Could you put the lucky man on?

21:53.437 --> 21:58.233
Are you kidding, Mrs. Biomonte? Geez. No.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.861
He's got to come down to our agency.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.823
Our manager, Mr. Furillo,
has got to make the presentation.

22:04.906 --> 22:05.741
(chuckles)

22:06.491 --> 22:09.911
Mrs. Biomonte, if your husband
doesn't call us back within half an hour,

22:10.370 --> 22:12.122
we've got to go to our alternate names.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.584
You think you could do that?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.046
Hold on. I'll give you our number.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.423
-We got a blind number?
-Yeah.

22:23.592 --> 22:30.140
Ma'am, it's JL5-4712. Right.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.101
Got to be inside half an hour, Mrs. B.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.022
Philip Dugan, that's correct. Attagirl.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.027
Joe Biomonte. Psh!

22:43.070 --> 22:44.905
Want to make the presentation, Captain?

22:54.623 --> 22:57.084
It was awful.
I bent over to light her cigarette,

22:57.626 --> 22:59.836
and it sounded like a cannon
exploded behind me.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.798
See, there's no material left to let out.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.843
So, what I would do,
I would put a gusset in these

23:07.010 --> 23:10.889
and buy a new pair
with a somewhat larger size.

23:10.972 --> 23:11.807
Come here.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.934
Yeah, but I'm gonna lose weight.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.144
Well, when you lose the weight,
you can take them in.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.355
We got some lovely pants here.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.817
They're nice... contemporary.

23:22.317 --> 23:25.153
A gusset in the old pants,
new pants with alterations.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.071
Bada-bing, bada-bing.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.657
I can let you have the whole deal
for 30 bucks.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.159
-Available when?
-MICK: Well, I got your measurements.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.078
I could have them for you tomorrow.

23:33.453 --> 23:37.666
-You got a deal.
-Deal? Satisfaction, Mr. Simpson?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.085
MR. SIMPSON: Very satisfied.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.547
-I'll see you, Mr. Berman.
-BERMAN: See you.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.967
Ya blimp. So, what did you sell him?

23:47.467 --> 23:51.096
Uh, a gusset for his old pair
and the 48s off this rack.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.559
-A gusset?
-I thought I'd save him a couple of bucks.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.894
You want Mr. Dirigible to die
a rich man, Mike?

23:57.978 --> 23:59.563
-That's your life's ambition?
-MICK: I just thought--

23:59.646 --> 24:01.606
Why are you here?
To help Berman make a living.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.524
Now, I thought--

24:02.607 --> 24:04.943
If the man's a candidate
for several pairs of pants,

24:05.026 --> 24:06.653
several pairs of pants
is what we sell him!

24:06.736 --> 24:07.612
It's my mistake.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.656
BERMAN: Don't make any more, Mr. Gusset.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.076
If you want to do charity,
go work on a telethon.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.162
-Here, we go for profit.
-All right.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.541
Here. Go get me a lamb-kabob
at the Greek's.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.544
-Lemon?
-Yeah!

24:24.713 --> 24:28.300
Oh. Order from the old man.
Sometimes he forgets to collect.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.634
Yes, sir.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.763
(car horn honks)

24:38.143 --> 24:41.563
-STAN: I mean, if you mind.
-I said I don't mind.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.441
I get ants in my pants sitting over there.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.234
-Sarge, will you just drive?
-Yeah.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.740
-Nice pep in these new units.
-Yeah, they went back to the V-8s.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.241
(tires screeching)

24:53.325 --> 24:54.201
Did you see that?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.578
-You see what that guy just did?
-Yeah.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.039
Yeah. Run the plates on that guy, Joe.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.832
Jerk's a menace.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.084
JOE: You know, Sarge,
we were kind of close there.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.254
No offense, but did you ever think of
using your glasses when you drive?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.632
Just for reading. Why?

25:09.090 --> 25:09.925
(computer beeps)

25:10.926 --> 25:11.843
No reason.

25:11.927 --> 25:16.181
YRX-247. That's an '82 Pontiac, dark blue.

25:16.264 --> 25:20.185
Which ain't the guy in front of us.
What I tell you, Joe? Guy's rolling.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.855
-(siren wailing)
-(tire screeching)

25:30.403 --> 25:34.699
Ah! Sarge. Sarge, no!

25:53.927 --> 25:55.387
All right, freeze! That's it!

25:56.680 --> 25:58.640
Don't move! No more moving!

26:11.403 --> 26:13.530
I never thought
I'd get in touch with him in time!

26:13.613 --> 26:14.864
-Wasn't that lucky?
-(giggles)

26:14.948 --> 26:18.201
You know, if your nephew and Mrs. B.
want to come to the presentation,

26:18.285 --> 26:19.828
that's great, Mr. Biomonte.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.581
But I'm afraid they'll have to take
their own transportation.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.125
She can take a cab,
but he goes everywhere with me.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.502
-Joseph.
-Uh, the contest rules say that

26:27.586 --> 26:29.588
a companion's ixnayed. Okay, Mr. Dugan?

26:30.088 --> 26:32.173
The limousine ride's actually
part of the prize.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.594
-Your nephew's not a prizewinner.
-I'll follow right behind you, Joe.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.847
-Presentation ceremony, Neal.
-NEAL: Yes, sir.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.060
Look at that, a colored driver.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.103
MAN: Come on.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.485
Just between us, fellas, I...

26:53.111 --> 26:56.072
is there any way I could take
a friend along on this cruise

26:56.156 --> 26:57.324
instead of the wife?

26:57.866 --> 26:59.034
Let me be the heavy with her, Joe.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.410
I'll tell her the other
ticket fell through.

27:00.493 --> 27:04.289
Yeah, 'cause two weeks on
a boat with that battleaxe,

27:04.873 --> 27:07.125
-I'm gonna get a heart attack.
-Very doable.

27:08.835 --> 27:13.590
So, you drew my name off
a Vegas plane list, huh?

27:14.507 --> 27:15.508
That was it, right?

27:16.217 --> 27:17.886
Yeah, 'cause I'm not listed anywhere,
you know.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.554
I'm-I'm not even in the phone book.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.682
It was either off a plane list
or a warrant.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.645
What's that supposed to mean?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.731
You're way too modest, Joey.
You say you're not listed anyplace.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.233
Your name is on five different wants.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.320
Listen, I-I'm getting a sick feeling.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.155
It's a pop, Joey.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.325
-Are you kidding?
-Would we kid you, Joey?

27:40.575 --> 27:43.328
-You have the right to remain silent.
-Unbelievable.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.121
If you give up that right,

27:45.830 --> 27:48.583
anything you say can
and will be used against you.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.211
I'm sick. Can I have a drink?

27:51.628 --> 27:54.506
Pay attention to the man, Joey.
He's telling you what you won.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.841
You have the right
to speak with an attorney.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.596
Your Honor, Mr. Jackson's accused
of stealing goods worth three dollars

28:01.680 --> 28:03.765
in order to buy necessities
for his family.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.601
They're at the shantytown
by the freight yards.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.021
The living situation is precarious.
Mr. Jackson's family needs him.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.400
I strongly urge a recognizance release.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.028
I'm looking at the probationer's report
right here, Ms. Davenport.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.572
Specific recommendation
against recognizance

28:19.656 --> 28:20.782
because the man has no address.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.158
It's because the man has no address

28:22.242 --> 28:23.868
that he's here in the first place,
Your Honor.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.871
The family was subletting.
The lessor absconded with a rent--

28:26.955 --> 28:29.374
All right, how about no time
on a guilty plea?

28:29.457 --> 28:30.417
He can't plead, Your Honor.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.043
There's a matter
of an old parole situation.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.213
Look, we can't turn ourselves inside out
on a single case.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.132
-Five hundred dollars. Cash or bond.
-(gavel bangs)

28:38.091 --> 28:39.843
-What's going on?
-They're holding you over.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.720
Oh, no, Your Honor, please!

28:41.803 --> 28:44.305
My wife and my babies.
Please, you got to help me.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.766
They don't have nobody out there
to take care of them!

28:46.975 --> 28:47.892
Your Honor, please!

28:47.976 --> 28:51.479
Yes, I know in order to do your job
you need a viable system of distribution.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.274
Why can't the man just walk down
to your office and pick up the check?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.358
Ain't that viable enough for you people?

28:55.442 --> 28:57.902
We got this situation, Lynn.
I was hoping you might do a story.

28:57.986 --> 29:01.239
The man is living in a box
with his entire family!

29:01.531 --> 29:03.616
Does that sound like
a welfare cheat to you?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.035
A family, four little ones,
living in that Boxville.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.872
The rent got screwed up.
They can't get welfare without an address.

29:08.955 --> 29:12.041
And now the city won't provide housing
without separating the family.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.129
Well, the husband is in jail. He can't
make bail on a three dollar arrest.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.381
So you got his wife,
his kids living down there...

29:18.465 --> 29:20.008
BOTH: ...in a cardboard box.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.762
Interested enough to take
a camera crew down there?

29:23.845 --> 29:25.221
-(telephone ringing)
-All right.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.559
-LUCY: Hill Street station.
-Hm?

29:29.851 --> 29:30.685
LUCY: Have you asked him

29:30.769 --> 29:31.811
-to turn down the radio?
-Oh, Judas,

29:31.895 --> 29:34.230
and they promised
the captain's rankings by 2:00.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.692
Are you surprised, Howard?
When was this department ever on time?

29:38.109 --> 29:41.488
-Well, you take waiting better than I do.
-I've had nine years' training.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.785
-You should be ashamed of yourself.
-I am. I hate myself.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.703
You get her out of here, will ya?
I'm gonna bust an ulcer.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.831
Phil, we didn't get a chance yet.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.291
-Henry Goldblume.
-How you doing?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.709
-You got a second?
-Yeah.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.840
I want to ask you about
a Midtown homicide guy,

30:00.924 --> 30:02.926
-Detective Torriello?
-Giovanni?

30:03.009 --> 30:05.011
HENRY: Working the Gina Sgrignoli killing?

30:05.094 --> 30:07.305
Whoa! Henry Goldblume.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.225
-She was my girlfriend.
-Right. I'm sorry.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.228
Can you tell me anything
about what Torriello's got?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.731
-Not really, Lieutenant.
-HENRY: What do you mean, "not really"?

30:16.898 --> 30:18.191
I mean, I'm not really sure.

30:18.566 --> 30:20.527
I mean, but plus,
aren't you supposed to stay clear?

30:20.610 --> 30:21.486
HENRY: Hey, listen.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.657
Listen, I've been getting
handled for three weeks, shut out.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.827
They shot her down in front of me.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.038
I'd appreciate it if you know anything,
I'd appreciate it if you'd say.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.419
I think they got a guy on ice
at the Hotel Worth.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.088
Torriello's down there every day.

30:42.674 --> 30:47.053
-Don't get stupid with it, Lieutenant.
-Thanks.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.770
What the hell are you
doing here, Lieutenant?

30:55.854 --> 30:59.023
Torriello, if you don't let me in,
I swear to God, I'll do violence.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.526
(sighs)

31:08.533 --> 31:09.868
Visitors!

31:11.202 --> 31:12.871
Sonny Murdo, Lieutenant Goldblume.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.372
Hi ya, Lieutenant.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.586
-Sonny.
-From where's he from?

31:22.797 --> 31:23.882
Don't recognize me, huh, Sonny?

31:23.965 --> 31:28.136
Geez, (chuckles) did we talk already?
I'm seeing so many people.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.805
He was at the hit, Sonny,
sitting at the table.

31:31.848 --> 31:32.765
No kidding.

31:34.809 --> 31:38.062
You know,
it's not about personalities, Lieutenant.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.898
Let him ask you what he wants to know.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.150
Absolutely, sure.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.612
Why was she killed?

31:47.947 --> 31:50.325
Be honest with you,
I couldn't tell you, Lieutenant.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.328
I know the hit came
from Sgrignoli's brother.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.413
-Brother's in soomers 17 to--
-Who hired you?

31:57.832 --> 31:59.000
Freddy Charles.

32:00.001 --> 32:03.338
I got $1,500 in front,
six grand at the whack.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.131
TORRIELLO: Charles is a contract guy.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.928
So, what did they tell you about Gina?

32:11.471 --> 32:12.764
She was a young one.

32:15.391 --> 32:18.144
Said if I had a clear shot
to put one in her mouth.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.736
I guess 'cause she was talking, see?

32:32.325 --> 32:33.326
He's just a button guy,

32:33.409 --> 32:35.036
but he's given us some
pretty decent stuff.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.788
-How they piece the work out.
-How long?

32:36.871 --> 32:37.705
How long what?

32:40.541 --> 32:42.543
When did you make the bust?
How long you been sitting on him?

32:42.627 --> 32:45.129
I grabbed him the next morning.
The morning after the hit.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.381
Come on, let go.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.551
You know how many snitches got rousted,

32:50.635 --> 32:52.887
how many favors got called in
the past three weeks?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.974
Lieutenant, you've been going with a girl
with nothing but bad connections.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.393
Plus, you're doing pretty good
with the clothes and the rest of it.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.106
Nobody knew where you stood,
why you're asking the questions.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.357
I loved her!

33:05.441 --> 33:07.151
Tell you the truth, that's what I said.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.569
That it was probably
just that you loved her.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.197
But we figured your captain
had the best read.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.448
He knew what to give you.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.411
-What do you mean?
-We kept Captain Furillo apprised.

33:18.371 --> 33:21.249
We figured he'd bring you up to speed
when he thought you ought to know.

33:27.005 --> 33:27.922
I'm sorry, kid.

33:30.925 --> 33:31.843
(sighs)

33:34.804 --> 33:37.598
Come on, forget the water.
We're moving in a straight line here.

33:37.765 --> 33:41.269
-You okay, Sarge?
-Uh... gas. Come on, over here.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.898
-Grand theft auto, resisting arrest.
-"A" collar, guy.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.945
-And the bonus was, we lived.
-Oh? Was Stan the wheelman?

33:51.237 --> 33:52.488
A regular Barney Oldfield.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.617
-I got pain here.
-LUCY: What's wrong?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.745
-(groans)
-Stan.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.954
-JOE: Sarge.
-I can't breathe!

34:00.038 --> 34:01.164
-Stan.
-JOE: Easy, easy, easy.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.957
-LUCY: Call an ambulance, Natalie!
-(groans)

34:03.041 --> 34:04.584
It's like-- it's like a fist.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.711
Never mind the ambulance.
Joe, drive him to Mercy.

34:06.794 --> 34:07.879
All right, we got a unit outside.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.672
Just take it easy.
Come on, here we go, Sarge.

34:09.756 --> 34:10.798
(Joe grunts)

34:10.882 --> 34:12.383
-Come on. Stay with us.
-A little better now.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.260
-Stay with us.
-OFFICER 1: You're gonna be fine, Sarge.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.679
-We'll go in separate cars.
-I'll bring it around.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.599
You bastard.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.186
I never even thought to ask you.
I mean, you are my friend.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.812
I figured if you knew anything,
you'd tell me.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.856
Henry, there are reasons
why family isn't apprised

34:26.939 --> 34:27.982
till after disposition.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.275
-Don't quote policy to me.
-(sighs)

34:29.358 --> 34:30.401
And what would you have done with it?

34:30.485 --> 34:31.986
What would you have done
if I had told you?

34:32.445 --> 34:33.321
I'd have known.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.990
And when you found out that
they had pleaded him down

34:36.074 --> 34:37.867
in order to get information,
what would you have done with that?

34:37.950 --> 34:39.827
Gone to the papers? Gone after him?

34:40.536 --> 34:42.413
Then what kind of friend
would I have turned out to be?

34:42.497 --> 34:45.583
-Probably would have cost you your job.
-You don't get to choose my life!

34:48.002 --> 34:50.213
-I won't forgive you for this.
-I've got to get to the hospital.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.715
Did you happen to notice
Stan Jablonski on the way in?

34:57.136 --> 34:59.806
Hear anything good, Luce?
Why don't you mind your own business?

35:06.479 --> 35:07.897
LUCY: Woman in the locker room!

35:09.190 --> 35:10.066
No ranks.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.861
No ranks.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.616
I'm speaking for a lot of people
getting real tired of waiting

35:18.699 --> 35:19.951
for you to get off this thing.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.621
Sick of you being rude and taking shots
and sick of walking on eggs.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.207
You are not the first person
who has ever had a loss,

35:26.290 --> 35:28.626
and it doesn't give you
the right to stop being human.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.011
Woman coming out!

35:41.681 --> 35:45.560
(siren wailing)

35:45.643 --> 35:47.728
Hey, fellas, you like the suits, huh?

35:47.895 --> 35:50.690
Hey, take a look at the name
in the label in the jacket.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.734
-You recognize that famous designer?
-Yeah, I heard of that.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.571
Anywhere else downtown,
they charge an extra $100.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.240
I ain't asking how you can afford
to sell them 80 cheap, man.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.658
Good. Don't ask.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.410
See they don't steal nothing.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.036
BERMAN: What could I do for you, fellas?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.538
-Hal Berman?
-Uh-huh.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.416
We're associates of Lieutenant Flaherty
from Midtown, Hal.

36:08.916 --> 36:12.295
-Hey. Why don't you guys beat it?
-Why is that?

36:13.462 --> 36:15.840
-'Cause I said so.
-Hey, take it easy!

36:15.923 --> 36:17.341
Man, take it easy.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.094
-Hey. Them's customers, you know?
-Hal, look at me.

36:20.803 --> 36:24.307
We're working on those suits got stolen
from Jason's Clothiers.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.933
Same case as Lieutenant Flaherty.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.436
Lieutenant sent us for some more evidence.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.397
What size evidence you need?

36:31.647 --> 36:36.027
-Uh, 42 long with a 34 inseam.
-MAN 2: And a 40 regular.

36:36.110 --> 36:40.781
The 42-34 will be a charcoal suit,
plus sports coat and slacks.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.118
Hey, look, fellas,
I'm-I'm trying to be cooperative,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.537
but this is getting to be
a lot of free garments now.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.249
Hal, you're moving hot clothes
out of here.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.544
Now, plan "A" is you can alter
some with our measurements,

36:53.628 --> 36:55.546
or plan "B" is you can take a bust.

36:55.838 --> 36:59.842
-"A." Plan "A"?
-Right. "A" is always the best.

37:00.801 --> 37:06.140
They... they boosted a nice bolt
of pinstripe flannel.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.645
-I'll custom-make your suit.
-Hal, I got a christening on Friday.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.063
You'll have it.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.398
I'll get the material.
You come back tomorrow afternoon.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.777
-Hal, you're a prince.
-It's my pleasure.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.158
It's a disgrace what they
get away with in this city!

37:24.242 --> 37:28.621
I know. Uh, Mr. Berman, um,
you think I could take my hour now?

37:28.996 --> 37:31.249
BERMAN: You don't get paid, you know.
This ain't United Way.

37:33.876 --> 37:37.463
So alcohol's included?
No particular reason.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.258
I just wanted to know the range
of what you were checking for.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.342
(knocking on door)

37:41.968 --> 37:44.136
Yeah, right. Thanks.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.433
-Mick?
-Uh...

37:50.643 --> 37:54.438
we got some dirty cops at Midtown.
They just came into my undercover.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.649
-They're shaking down the owner.
-They make you?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.943
I couldn't put a name
on either one of them.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.780
Possible they were impersonating cops
just to run the shakedown?

38:02.863 --> 38:03.906
They had the shields.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.742
I was gonna take the place tomorrow.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.870
I think we ought to postpone the bust
and see what we can get on these guys.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.789
Okay, I'll have IAD
run some photos for you.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.586
MALE ANCHOR (on TV):
<i>...from Lynn Williams. Lynn?</i>

38:18.129 --> 38:20.673
WILLIAMS:<i> Were you there</i>
<i>when the officers arrested your husband?</i>

38:21.841 --> 38:23.884
<i>No, they came and told me about it.</i>

38:24.927 --> 38:27.888
<i>Are you frightened with your husband</i>
<i>in jail, being here alone?</i>

38:29.974 --> 38:31.892
<i>He kept watch through the night.</i>

38:33.644 --> 38:35.896
<i>How long can you survive</i>
<i>like this, Mrs. Jackson?</i>

38:38.149 --> 38:39.025
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:41.527 --> 38:42.445
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:43.571 --> 38:45.656
LUCY: They just don't
have any place to go.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.075
-Ray, Howard?
-Interview results, Frank?

38:48.367 --> 38:53.080
-Uh, end of suspense, Raymondo.
-I probably spoke too fast again.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.167
I tried to measure my breathing.
(chuckles)

38:56.584 --> 38:58.461
Uh, could you give us just a minute,
Howard?

38:58.794 --> 38:59.837
Oh,<i> absolutamente.</i>

39:05.843 --> 39:09.555
-Fourth.
-Fourth? Really?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.266
Yeah, maybe this time's the charm.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.851
Fourth, Frank?

39:15.686 --> 39:16.687
Thank you.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.360
Rarefied air, Ray? Upper half?

39:23.402 --> 39:26.113
-Fourth, Howard. Fourth.
-Fourth?

39:29.241 --> 39:30.576
(chuckles) Is that so?

39:31.202 --> 39:32.203
(Frank clears throat)

39:35.915 --> 39:36.957
Fifteenth.

39:38.125 --> 39:42.713
Fifteenth, Frank?
Judas, there only were 15.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.883
I don't know how to sugar
the pill for you, Howard.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.393
Did they give a reason?

39:56.602 --> 39:59.230
-"Poor cognizance of command structure."
-HOWARD: What?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.857
Frank, I take the chain of command
as gospel.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.152
I would no more usurp a superior's
prerogative in the field than--

40:05.236 --> 40:09.198
Did you happen to talk about the tank?
Going to Daniels for funding?

40:11.534 --> 40:13.119
Maybe they thought that was out of line.

40:16.622 --> 40:19.250
Well, if that's their idea
of command prerogative, uh...

40:19.917 --> 40:22.837
-who initials a purchase order.
-I'm sorry, Howard.

40:28.175 --> 40:31.470
Well, leave it to the bureaucrats, Frank.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.056
They'll be fighting this war
for urban survival

40:34.140 --> 40:36.684
with snub-nosed organizational charts.

40:39.353 --> 40:43.357
(siren wailing)

40:43.941 --> 40:45.109
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Dr. Hammil.</i>

40:45.192 --> 40:48.362
<i>Dr. C. Hammil, please report to O.R. stat.</i>

40:48.612 --> 40:50.364
<i>-Dr. Hammil.</i>
-Doc, he's family.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.243
You have no cardiac irregularities,
no enzyme changes.

40:54.326 --> 40:56.454
We're 98 percent sure
you didn't have an attack.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.958
All of which I could have told you.
It's angina. I'm out of here.

41:01.041 --> 41:04.336
You're not out of here.
I want another 24 hours' observation,

41:04.712 --> 41:06.964
see if we want to change
the regime on your medication.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.717
-What's the matter with the old regime?
-Sarge.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.511
I agree this is probably just a slightly
more intense episode

41:12.595 --> 41:14.513
of what you've been living with
for the last six years,

41:14.597 --> 41:15.723
but it can also be a warning.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.267
I want you here long enough
to rule that out.

41:19.101 --> 41:20.394
Okay, Dr. Jablonski?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.022
-Will you not give me a hard time?
-Yeah.

41:24.398 --> 41:25.483
See you in the morning.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.988
You are a very tough customer.

41:31.071 --> 41:35.493
Eh, enzyme blenders!
It's all a bunch of gobbledygook.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.870
Uh, Mick, here.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.997
This is what I want you
to do for me tomorrow.

41:40.664 --> 41:44.084
"Collect warrants and Division memos.
Place on clipboard at podium."

41:44.168 --> 41:47.213
Yeah, it all comes in a packet
about a quarter to 7:00.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.590
It's just in case the sawbones
is late in signing me out.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.676
-He said they're keeping you here!
-In a pig's eye.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.764
Mick, hell or high water, I'm out of here.
I'm at that podium tomorrow a.m.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.641
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>All visitors, please be advised...</i>

41:58.724 --> 42:00.643
-What?
-You are a pistol.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.520
I am a pistol.

42:04.438 --> 42:07.733
Couple of seconds there in the squad room,
I thought I was out of rounds.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.778
(sighs) I'll call you later on.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.073
Yeah, I don't know what time
the switchboard closes.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.035
-Thanks for coming, Mick.
-Hmm.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.872
(monitor beeps rapidly)

42:22.831 --> 42:25.876
Ah, it's on a fritz.
Damn thing does that all the time.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.254
-Good night.
-Good night.

42:29.922 --> 42:30.756
Change?

42:44.603 --> 42:47.064
I should have never said anything.
I was totally out of line.

42:47.648 --> 42:50.442
-What are you talking about?
-Goldblume.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.195
Somebody had to say something.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.239
I mean, I like the guy, Joe.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.157
I wasn't looking to put
my finger in his face.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.410
It's not like he hasn't been
having a rough time.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.745
Luce, you just said
what everyone's been thinking

43:01.829 --> 43:02.997
for the last of couple weeks.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.165
Now either he can take it,
or the hell with him.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.167
Great. So now he's not gonna talk to me

43:07.251 --> 43:08.669
-for the rest of my life.
-(Henry clears throat)

43:11.672 --> 43:12.590
HENRY: Good night, Luce.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.222
MICK: He was feisty. He was looking good.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.142
-Come sit with us, have a beer.
-No, I got to get home.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.102
-Spread the word around for me?
-Yeah.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.895
-See you in the morning.
-MICK: Okay.

43:38.115 --> 43:39.450
Is that the guy that bites?

43:39.867 --> 43:43.203
Belker. The best undercover
I've ever seen.

43:43.579 --> 43:46.540
I hear he's working that outlet
for the clothes they stole from Julio's.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.876
That where it's from?
That store in Midtown?

43:49.376 --> 43:50.502
How's he doing with that?

43:52.087 --> 43:54.506
Garibaldi and I were supposed to do backup
and arrest tomorrow,

43:54.590 --> 43:58.469
but it was postponed.
Are you writing a book?

43:58.552 --> 44:00.804
(scoffs) No.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.224
I was remembering how much I like you.

44:06.518 --> 44:09.229
It was one night, Dugan.
Don't make it<i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>

44:09.688 --> 44:14.276
-That's all it was? Just once?
-Just once.

44:15.402 --> 44:17.154
How about we double our quota, Patsy?

44:20.032 --> 44:22.368
Ply me with a little more hooch.
We'll talk.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.211
-PHIL: Hey, guys.
-Hey.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.007
What do you think?

44:37.091 --> 44:38.509
-Phil?
-J.D.: Mm-hmm.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.344
Sweet pickup on that ginzo shylock.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.097
-Guy reminds me of me.
-NEAL: Meaning what?

44:43.514 --> 44:45.766
Meaning I like him, okay?
But I don't exactly trust him.

44:46.141 --> 44:46.975
Hmm.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.481
-How about it?
-How about what?

44:53.023 --> 44:55.275
How 'bout you tell me
what you've been sitting on all day.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.405
You know, if they test for codeine
in those samples,

44:59.488 --> 45:00.698
I'm coming up positive.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.742
(hisses) For your knee.
I thought you had a script.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.744
It's not from the department doc.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.498
He wanted to take me off the streets.
I told him the knee was better.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.166
Started using my own guy.

45:12.042 --> 45:14.044
They don't want you to work
the street behind painkillers.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.379
It screws up their liability.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.965
Hey, Neal, come on. Cheer up.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.969
Worst case, we're talking disability.
We're talking winters in Antigua.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.929
Hey, look, man, I don't like Antigua,

45:24.012 --> 45:26.682
and I don't like beaches,
and I don't like handouts.

45:26.932 --> 45:29.727
-I like working.
-That's a sick attitude.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.481
MALE ANCHOR (on TV)<i>:</i>
<i>...very happy to present that money now</i>

45:34.898 --> 45:36.817
<i>to Mr. and Mrs. Pablo Jackson.</i>

45:37.735 --> 45:41.029
<i>Thank you. It has indeed</i>

45:41.113 --> 45:42.239
<i>for the Jackson family.</i>

45:42.531 --> 45:45.451
<i>But it's also an extraordinary day</i>

45:45.951 --> 45:48.787
<i>There are those, of course,</i>

45:50.164 --> 45:52.791
-BOBBY: Thanks, Ray.
-That's a good woman.

45:54.877 --> 45:55.794
Don't I know it?

45:57.463 --> 46:00.424
Felt like we worked pretty good together
ourselves for being rusty.

46:02.468 --> 46:03.385
Worked okay.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.015
WILLIAMS (on TV):
<i>A check in the amount of $840.</i>

46:08.599 --> 46:09.725
PABLO (on TV)<i>: Thank you.</i>

46:09.808 --> 46:12.853

46:13.520 --> 46:17.107
<i>I'd like to say thank you.</i>
<i>God bless you, all of you.</i>

<i>This is gonna go for our first month,</i>

46:21.278 --> 46:22.196
WILLIAMS:<i> All for the apartment?</i>

46:24.531 --> 46:27.242
<i>Couple of dollars</i>
<i>for Donald's birthday cake.</i>

46:27.910 --> 46:29.953
<i>I also understand another</i>
<i>generous citizen put a--</i>

46:30.037 --> 46:30.871
(television turns off)

46:33.332 --> 46:34.917
Makes it look easy, doesn't it?

46:37.377 --> 46:40.464
Look, here's a poor person.
Let's all pitch in and help.

46:41.840 --> 46:45.761
(sighs) A few hours later, poof.
He's not poor anymore.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.307
Am I sensing a bit
of jealousy here, counselor?

46:51.892 --> 46:53.852
Are you saying Miss Williams
did more for your client

46:53.936 --> 46:55.687
-than you could have done?
-(chuckles)

46:57.147 --> 47:00.734
I just wonder if that kind
of sentimental quick fix

47:00.818 --> 47:04.780
doesn't make people more impatient
with the problems that can't be solved

47:04.863 --> 47:06.824
between the 6:00

who still have the problems

-It was just angina.

47:27.553 --> 47:30.138

47:30.764 --> 47:33.350

without me, all right?

47:33.433 --> 47:35.769

the roll call without you.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.488
(chuckles) You too.

48:01.295 --> 48:05.215
