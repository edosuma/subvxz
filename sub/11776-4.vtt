we've been testing you

00:15.833 --> 00:18.267

needed to become an Ink Master.

This week,
these are your canvases.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.100
Wow.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.833
[narrator] The artists'
shading skills

00:25.900 --> 00:28.267

in the Flash Challenge.

It's called
three-quarter lighting.

into a art class...

00:31.733 --> 00:33.033

stood out the most was Al.

another head tattoo.

Everything that's covered
by hair right now,

00:51.700 --> 00:53.133
I would like to be covered
by a tattoo.

00:53.733 --> 00:55.267
My clients are going to be
the death of me.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.467

all the time.

00:57.533 --> 00:58.867
The door is right there.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.000
Don't let it hit you
on the way out.

01:00.067 --> 01:02.033

the [bleep] thing wrong,

01:02.100 --> 01:03.767

-Bull[bleep].

just be real.

I'd be real.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.500

like that particular image.

01:17.933 --> 01:18.900

that's on somebody forever.

Any one of you could
justifiably be sent home.

Al, you don't have
what it takes

01:38.100 --> 01:39.100

Seven artists remain,

01:42.267 --> 01:45.833

a $100 thousand prize

it's bull[bleep].

the canvas I wanted.

at that one no more.

I've got to just not get
some weird-ass client again.

starting to get serious.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.100
I know who
my competitors are,

03:09.167 --> 03:10.867
I know what their strengths
and weaknesses are,

03:10.933 --> 03:13.433
and I got a really good chance
of winning this.

right now.

Inked Magazine,

the title of Ink Master.

This week, we're testing
your technical precision.

As always, we begin
with the Flash Challenge.

The winner will get first pick
of the human canvas

03:40.067 --> 03:41.400
for the Elimination Tattoo.

03:41.467 --> 03:42.900
In this Flash Challenge,
you'll be applying

03:42.967 --> 03:45.133
one of the most popular designs
to your canvas,

03:45.833 --> 03:46.500
a beveled star.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.767
Sounds kind of easy, right?

03:51.367 --> 03:52.233
Not necessarily.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.800
Each one of your clients
wants their star

03:54.867 --> 03:55.800
on either their knee...

03:57.633 --> 03:58.467
or on their elbow.

03:59.067 --> 04:00.367
[Bleep]

04:00.433 --> 04:01.900
Lord have mercy.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.967
It's really hard
to get a beveled star

04:04.033 --> 04:06.500
on a kneecap or an elbow.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.933
Basically, the skin
is very calloused.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.300
So it's going
to be really hard

04:10.367 --> 04:12.200
to get the points
really, really tight

04:12.267 --> 04:13.300
on some crazy skin.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.933
[Dave] Your star must be smooth
with tight lines

04:16.000 --> 04:17.767
and a clear,
symmetrical design.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.200
Not only is
the skin calloused

04:19.267 --> 04:22.500
and possibly scarred from just,
you know, years of abuse,

04:22.567 --> 04:24.733
but you're dealing
with a warping area of skin

04:24.800 --> 04:25.833
that's constantly stretching.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.733
You'll be judged by Oliver Peck,

04:27.800 --> 04:29.200
Chris Nunez, and myself.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.833
Plus, today, we have
a very special guest judge.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.833
As creative director of
Inked Magazine,

04:34.900 --> 04:36.567

04:36.633 --> 04:37.500

[Todd] Through my work
at Inked Magazine,

04:41.167 --> 04:43.167
I see a lot of tattoos.

04:43.233 --> 04:46.033
I'm looking more
from a creative standpoint.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.667
So I look more for
the placement of the tattoo,

04:48.733 --> 04:50.833
color, the idea behind it,
the concept.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.467
Todd,
in your experience,

04:52.533 --> 04:55.167
what makes some tattoos
stand out more than others.

04:55.467 --> 04:56.967
[Todd] Well, Dave,
I'm a visual person,

04:57.033 --> 04:59.167
so I'm really into,
like, bright colors

04:59.233 --> 05:00.433
and, like, placement
of tattoos.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.800
So it's really more about,
for me, the visual element.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.233
[Dave] Well, thanks for helping
us out today, man.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.467
-[Todd] Sure.
-[Dave] Alright, guys.

there's a Flash Challenge

with tattooing.

what I can do.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.433
As you can see,
there are seven stars here.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.967
Each star has one of
your names on the back.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.333
One by one, the canvases
will select a star

05:21.400 --> 05:23.533
to determine which of you
will be their artist.

going to be a lot nicer

the guys' knees or elbows.

Get to work.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.667
Technical precision,
in this challenge,

05:51.733 --> 05:54.200
means putting very straight,
perfect lines

05:54.267 --> 05:56.233
on very rounded objects.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.400
Basically, knees and elbows
have peaks

05:58.467 --> 05:59.900
and they have valleys.

05:59.967 --> 06:01.767
Trying to do straight lines
through both of those are...

06:01.833 --> 06:02.800
Very hard to do.

really, really hard

06:09.567 --> 06:11.067

07:42.333 --> 07:44.500
Red goes in
dang near anywhere,

a lot better putting red

pointier in the center.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.700
It's a little bit wide
where the stars line up.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.133
I'm getting
pretty exasperated.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.533
My work just seems
to go unnoticed.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.567
It'd be Nice
to win something for once.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.700
-How you doing, Shane?
-[Shane] What's up, man?

09:30.067 --> 09:30.967
[Dave] Did you pick that color?

09:31.033 --> 09:32.233
I gave her
a few bright colors.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.733
I asked her which one
she liked the best.

09:34.367 --> 09:37.667
The color, I was hoping
it'd be a little more vibrant.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.067
I'm hoping
it'll brighten up with time.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.433
It could heal
and be just fine,

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
but just being that light
on the skin,

09:44.567 --> 09:45.433
it's a little tricky.

09:46.633 --> 09:47.933
[Josh] He was struggling
with the color.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.267
It's one of his weakest
Flash Challenges for him.

09:50.333 --> 09:53.267
This is a competition,
so the more bad tattoos I see,

09:53.333 --> 09:54.400
the better
it means for me.

09:55.533 --> 09:57.000
[Dave] And James,
let's take a look at the star.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.567
[Todd] You have, like,
a big field of red

10:00.633 --> 10:03.067
and then, like, a sharp drop
right to the skin,

10:03.133 --> 10:04.567
stopping right at the line.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.167
It doesn't really
look intentional.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
[Oliver] I think if
you would have left

10:07.567 --> 10:09.200
a negative space
in the black as well,

10:10.033 --> 10:12.667
it would have been more
uniform all the way around.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.433
[Shane] Come on, man.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.233
That's a critical,
critical mistake.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.300
Josh, let's take a look.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.900
[Todd] It fits his arm
really well,

10:21.967 --> 10:23.433
fits Nice and squarely
on there,

10:24.033 --> 10:25.833
and the color looks
nice and even throughout.

10:25.900 --> 10:26.833
-It looks good.
-[Oliver] Yeah, it looks even.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.567
The skin doesn't look
traumatized.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.000
[Chris] The outline's
perfectly straight.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.733
[Dave] What's up, Bili?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.300
Dan got his knee done.
Let's take a look.

10:35.833 --> 10:36.967
It's weird,
it's kind of Brown.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.200
So's he.

10:38.967 --> 10:42.200
[Dan] It actually goes from,
like, a burgundy out to...

10:42.267 --> 10:44.000
That's actually
lipstick red, but...

10:44.067 --> 10:45.267
[Todd] Nah, it looks Brown.

10:46.833 --> 10:47.633
[Dave] Now Lea.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.567
[Oliver] I think
it's super bright and solid.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.633
If anything, it could have
gone just a little lower.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.200
We put it lower before,

10:54.267 --> 10:57.067
the stencil, and it looked
kind of like a starfish.

10:57.133 --> 10:58.633
That's why
we put it higher,

10:58.700 --> 11:00.700
so it look more like--
like a star.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.067
I don't think
her lines are as clean

11:02.133 --> 11:03.333
as they could have been.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.733
The ends of the stars
were not very crisp.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.700
They kind of came off
to a rounded point.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.300
Todd,
what are your thoughts?

11:12.367 --> 11:15.467
Aesthetically, the double
outline that Shane did,

11:15.533 --> 11:16.433
I thought was very cool.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.567
[Dave] The color wasn't as solid
as some of the others.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.700
I personally
didn't like James'.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.767
It's not really
uniform throughout,

11:25.833 --> 11:27.667
so it kind of looks
like it could be

11:27.733 --> 11:28.833
perceived as a mistake.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.900
I think that Heather and Josh
both did a really great job.

11:33.967 --> 11:37.167
Josh's line was really straight,
really symmetrical.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.433
If you think about
his work last week,

11:39.500 --> 11:40.600
he was in the bottom.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.033
He was almost
sent home.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.633
This is about
being well-rounded.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.733
Your tattoo today,
you didn't hit

11:45.800 --> 11:46.933
this Black and Gray Challenge.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.400
Hopefully, you know,
he can come back.

11:50.733 --> 11:51.600
Clearly there's a winner.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.800
Let's go let them know.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.367
So for this Flash Challenge,

11:55.433 --> 11:57.533
we tested your technical
precision skills

11:58.067 --> 11:59.467
by seeing how well
you tattooed

11:59.533 --> 12:02.133
a simple beveled star
on a difficult place.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.700
There is one artist
who stood out.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.633
[suspense music]

12:10.167 --> 12:11.100
And that one is Josh.

12:11.167 --> 12:14.433
[applause]

12:14.500 --> 12:16.000
[Dave] How quickly
the tide turns.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.000
Back from the dead.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.700
-[Dave] Look at that.
-That was the goal.

12:18.767 --> 12:20.567
So Flash Challenge win
number two.

12:20.633 --> 12:21.833
I'm super stoked.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.300
Now they're going to have
a hard time

12:23.367 --> 12:24.767
trying to eliminate me.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.733
I'm a little disappointed
I didn't get the first place.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.733
I feel like my star
was so frigging tight.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.933
I think Josh is one of
the weaker ones of the group.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.967
As the winner
of the Flash Challenge,

12:34.033 --> 12:36.333
you'll be given first choice
of the human canvases

12:36.400 --> 12:37.800
in this week's
Elimination Tattoo.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.067
You can all head down
to the brownstone.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.600
The competition is
getting tougher.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.000
The pressure is on.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.400
Everybody wants,
like, back pieces

12:49.467 --> 12:50.867
and full sleeves
and chest panels,

12:50.933 --> 12:52.567
and all that [bleep]
takes five hours.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.000
I don't think this is
an Ink Master piece.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.967
It's more like
an Ink Disaster piece.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.800
This is not
a good one out of you.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.167
[Josh] That was probably
the straightest, cleanest tattoo

13:08.233 --> 13:09.767
I've ever tried to do
in my life.

13:09.833 --> 13:10.967
[Shane] I didn't think
he had it in him.

13:11.033 --> 13:13.333
I feel like my star,
like, showed off

13:13.400 --> 13:15.867
some crazy linework
on a kneecap.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.067
They go around
and critique it and say,

13:17.133 --> 13:20.533
"This is based on
bold, solid color."

13:20.600 --> 13:22.133
Well, then I would have
[bleep] done that

13:22.200 --> 13:23.433
instead of wasting an hour

13:23.500 --> 13:25.900
doing the most precise [bleep]
you ever seen on a knee.

13:25.967 --> 13:26.933
At this point in the game,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.567
for as Long as
he's been tattooing,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.567
Shane should have picked
different color choices.

13:31.267 --> 13:32.533
[Shane] Ah, this pisses [bleep].

13:40.500 --> 13:41.567
We've all heard the saying

13:42.433 --> 13:43.900
"Picture paints
a thousand words."

13:44.333 --> 13:45.867
Today the Elimination Tattoo

13:46.467 --> 13:47.333
will do just the same.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.233
You'll be using
all of your precision skills

13:50.300 --> 13:52.000
to create
a photo-realistic tattoo.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.533
Photo-realism is probably

13:56.600 --> 13:59.100
the toughest thing
to do in tattooing.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.100
You just have
to look at a picture

14:01.167 --> 14:04.000
and duplicate it on the skin.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.733
Your design will need
to look like an actual photo.

14:07.167 --> 14:10.033
That means it must have
three-dimensional qualities.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.267
[Shane] So photo-realism,

14:11.333 --> 14:12.500
that's my thing,
you know what I mean?

14:12.567 --> 14:13.533
I don't expect anybody

14:13.600 --> 14:14.733
to beat me in this challenge.

14:15.700 --> 14:16.800
Let's meet your canvases.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.067
Down here on the end,
we have Robert.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.500
Robert wants a tattoo of food.

14:29.933 --> 14:32.767
Sandy wants either
a mountain lion or a wolf.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.800
Chris here,
a barn swallow in flight.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.033
Vic wants howling wolves.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.367
And Dawn wants
a snow leopard.

14:40.933 --> 14:44.300
Keith wants an incision
that reveals muscle and bone.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.967
And Scott there

14:46.033 --> 14:47.833
wants a fireman's helmet
with a shield.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.367
Alright, Josh, because
you won the Flash Challenge,

14:51.433 --> 14:53.367
you get the first pick
of the human canvases.

14:57.733 --> 14:58.933
Where are you looking
to put yours?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.800
Either right here,
a wolf or a tiger.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.700
My ideal canvas
would definitely be, like,

15:04.767 --> 15:06.467
paper White skin.
I love color,

15:06.533 --> 15:08.900
so that's going to do my work
tons of justice.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.733
And where you looking
to put yours?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.267
On my whole entire
left shoulder.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.600
Front, top, and back.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.967
And I'm looking for
someone who's got a great idea.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.000
What you looking to get done?

15:18.067 --> 15:19.433
Looking to get
fruits and vegetables

15:19.500 --> 15:21.567
down from my elbow all the way
down to my wrist into my hand.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.567
I'm gonna pick you, man.

15:30.433 --> 15:31.600
[Dave] A selection
has been made.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.100
[applause]

15:34.167 --> 15:36.000
I had a feeling
that Josh was going to pick

15:36.067 --> 15:37.333
the guy who wanted the fruit,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.767
because it really falls
into his style.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.767
I don't think he's as good
with photo-realistic stuff.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.400
So he'll be able to hide
some mistakes

15:44.467 --> 15:45.767
with these bright, bold colors.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.700
Alright,
the rest of the canvases

15:47.767 --> 15:50.367
will one by one pick up
a skull with your name on it.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.733
The canvas
that draws your name

15:51.800 --> 15:52.700
will be your client.

15:53.067 --> 15:55.300
Sandy, would you like
to come up and grab a skull?

15:55.367 --> 15:56.167
Sure.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.000
Tommy.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.067
Bili.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.500
I specialize
in photo-realism.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.500
I'm going to do well
this round.

16:05.967 --> 16:06.767
James.

16:08.533 --> 16:09.367
Lea.

16:09.433 --> 16:10.233
That's me.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.033
Shane.

16:13.167 --> 16:13.967
Heather.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.533
Alright, guys, you have
the rest of the afternoon

16:16.600 --> 16:17.800
to talk with your human canvas

16:17.867 --> 16:19.033
and come up with a design.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.767
Tomorrow, you'll have
six hours to tattoo.

16:22.033 --> 16:22.833
Good luck.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.567
Technical precision
relates to photo-realism

16:26.633 --> 16:28.033
because you have
to translate

16:28.100 --> 16:29.500
what's on the picture directly

16:29.567 --> 16:31.100
to what's going
on the skin.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.733
And when you have a picture
that you're working off,

16:33.800 --> 16:34.933
there are elements
in the picture

16:35.000 --> 16:36.433
that have to be hit
just right

16:36.500 --> 16:39.200
or it's never going to look
like that beautiful photo

16:39.267 --> 16:40.300
when it hits the skin.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.733
Kinda like you to figure out
the placement of it.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.933
We'll look at your efforts.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.133
Actually, I'm going
to leave it all up to you.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.267
-Really? Okay.
-Yeah.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.967
I want you to be
as creative as possible.

16:48.033 --> 16:48.833
Okay, cool.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.100
The reason why I'm getting
this tattoo is because my father

16:52.167 --> 16:53.400
-was an inspiration in my life.
-Sure.

16:53.467 --> 16:54.867
He was a fireman
and I'm a fireman.

16:54.933 --> 16:56.633
So I figured
there'd be nothing better

16:56.700 --> 16:58.333
than to get a helmet,
his old school helmet,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.233
with maybe some kind
of flames coming under it.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.400
Okay, I'm going to need
to take some photos of it.

17:02.467 --> 17:05.000
Photo-realism is obviously
exactly how it sounds.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.099
You're taking a photograph
and you're reproducing it.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.367
So you have to begin
with a really good photo.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.367
That's the most important part
of the tattoo.

17:11.867 --> 17:12.633
We're going to have
a lot of pictures

17:12.700 --> 17:13.500
to go through in a minute.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.666
The competition is stiff
and I want to win it.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.467
[James] I like
tattooing animals.

17:22.532 --> 17:23.733
I wanted
one of the animals,

17:23.800 --> 17:26.367
either the wolf
or the snow leopard.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.667
Uh, but I ended up
getting the birds.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.267
There's a lot of them
by my house

17:32.333 --> 17:33.333
-and they're always--
-Right, right.

17:33.867 --> 17:34.667
Close-knit.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.333
[James] Well, I'm trying to find
something in flight, you know?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.400
Like you were saying.

17:40.467 --> 17:41.667
It's going to be hard to find

17:41.733 --> 17:45.067
a really photo-realistic
picture of swallows.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.267
Man, I am so worried
about this one.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.000
My canvas Vic is asking
for four howling wolves,

17:53.067 --> 17:54.833
so I'm thinking, "Alright,
that's some cool images,"

17:54.900 --> 17:56.000
but then he tells me that

17:56.067 --> 17:57.933
it's... not
four howling wolves.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.967
It's, like,
a couple little cubs

18:00.033 --> 18:02.267
and they're all symbolizing
his kids and him and his wife,

18:02.333 --> 18:04.200
and there's a whole
giant scene behind it.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.467
Nobody on the planet
can do all this

18:06.533 --> 18:07.867
in the time we're given--
I can do some.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.500
What are the most
important parts of it to you?

18:09.567 --> 18:10.600
The wolves.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.033
Which wolves are
the most important part?

18:12.100 --> 18:13.700
-All of them.
-I know, dude.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.133
You... you just
can't do it.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.767
Even the four wolves
can't be done

18:16.833 --> 18:18.067
in that amount of time,

18:18.133 --> 18:20.833
so I have to talk him
into what can be done.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.767
If we motored
through the wolves,

18:22.833 --> 18:25.367
you're sacrificing
some quality.

18:25.433 --> 18:26.500
This is a competition, dude.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.800
I'm not going to do
a [bleep] quality tattoo

18:29.867 --> 18:31.600
and not show the judges
what I can do.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.033
[Bili] Well, my client today
wants to do a tattoo

18:38.100 --> 18:39.667
revealing the inner workings
of the body

18:39.733 --> 18:41.300
beneath the arm
and the collarbone.

18:41.367 --> 18:43.900
You want to do some
photo-real, like, sutures?

18:43.967 --> 18:45.200
No, no.

18:45.267 --> 18:46.867
[Bili] This is all the things
you can put in there.

18:47.267 --> 18:50.867
You can put the bones,
the veins, tendons...

18:52.333 --> 18:53.467
-Ligaments.
-Mm-hm.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.567
He's not really flexible.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.167
He definitely doesn't want
to allow me

18:57.233 --> 18:59.567
to approach this
in the most realistic fashion.

19:00.033 --> 19:01.367
The only thing I'm
concerned about is the skin.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.000
For just an incision,

19:03.067 --> 19:05.733
it's not going to give us
photo-real bloody stuff.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.067
I don't want
dripping blood

19:07.133 --> 19:08.767
like it's from the movies
from Hellraiser.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.733
I am a little stressed
right now.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.933
I'm getting these clients

19:12.000 --> 19:13.467
that aren't the easiest
to work with.

19:13.533 --> 19:14.967
I could be in for
a [bleep] storm.

19:15.033 --> 19:17.133
There is a possibility that
they could send me home on this.

19:29.033 --> 19:29.833
A few weeks in,

19:30.167 --> 19:31.333
everything's
more stressful.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.767
Just got to make sure
I can do it better

19:32.833 --> 19:35.033
than at least, you know,
a few other people.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.267
Josh is one of the people

19:36.333 --> 19:37.700
I think's a serious competitor
in our whole show.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.333
Time constraint's obviously
not a problem for you.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.233
I'm going to come out
with a tattoo this big.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.933
You're going to come out
with a tattoo this big.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.767
I don't want to only
do it better than somebody.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.533
I want to stay
at the top of the pack.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.433
[Bili] I'm here to win.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.300
I'm just going to do
a good tattoo.

19:50.367 --> 19:51.967
I figured if I trick the eye

19:52.033 --> 19:53.233
into perceiving that it's real,

19:53.833 --> 19:55.800
that's realism,
and that's... that's how I do--

19:55.867 --> 19:57.267
that's how
I define realism, so...

19:59.767 --> 20:00.967
Morning, everybody.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.267
It's time for you all to use
your technical precision

20:03.333 --> 20:05.533
to create
a photo-realistic design.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.500
The judges will be looking
for how realistic it looks.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.033
You have six hours
to complete your tattoo.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.133
And the clock starts now.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.600
Technical precision
plays heavy

20:18.667 --> 20:20.200
in the photo-realism category,

20:20.267 --> 20:23.633
just because you're dealing
with detailed images

20:23.700 --> 20:24.933
that have to look
a certain way.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.067
And if you
can't technically get

20:27.133 --> 20:28.533
the right sharp lines

20:28.600 --> 20:31.667
and the right smooth shading
in the right solid areas,

20:31.733 --> 20:32.933
your design's going to suffer.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.300
[Lea] The competition
is getting tougher.

20:36.367 --> 20:37.867
The pressure is on.

20:37.933 --> 20:40.200
So one really wants
to pull out their best job.

20:40.267 --> 20:41.733
And I want to win this.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.700
I love it.
It's great.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.367
Oh, yeah, dude.
Okay.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.367
Actually looks
really awesome,

20:48.433 --> 20:49.767
but I'm afraid it's coming into

20:49.833 --> 20:52.500
-this section too far.
-Okay, yeah, you can shrink it.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.200
My strategy right now
is to stay focused.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.433
This competition
is $100 thousand.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.833
And I want to win it.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.200
So I'm not just going
to slap a stencil on someone

21:01.267 --> 21:02.033
and go with it.

21:02.833 --> 21:03.700
Let me see your chest.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.567
There. Stand natural.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.600
There aren't too many shots
that really show what he wants

21:09.667 --> 21:10.900
without all
the blood and gore.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.200
It's been tough,
piecing them together,

21:12.267 --> 21:13.867
but I have
a really good plan.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.333
This is what people
come to me for.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.067
I specialize in photo-realism,

21:17.133 --> 21:19.233
and even when I'm doing stuff
that's completely made up

21:19.300 --> 21:21.967
and, you know, from my own head
or from the client's head,

21:22.033 --> 21:23.333
I apply
a realistic touch to it.

21:23.733 --> 21:24.800
Alright, you can sit down.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.400
For my taste, I would
want it in a little bit more.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.300
I'm going to put it on
one more time,

21:34.367 --> 21:36.533
'cause I know
I'll get penalized

21:36.600 --> 21:38.667
if it isn't exactly
correct on the chest.

21:39.467 --> 21:40.833
Everybody wants, like,
back pieces

21:40.900 --> 21:42.300
and full sleeves
and chest panels,

21:42.367 --> 21:44.433
and all that [bleep]
takes five hours, six hours,

21:44.500 --> 21:46.300
it's not possible
for us to do that.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.600
Okay, everybody.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.867
Five hours to go.
That's one hour down.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.767
Mother[bleep].

21:55.833 --> 21:57.233
[needles whirring]

21:57.300 --> 21:58.933
[Josh] My client has given me
a list of fruits and veggies

21:59.000 --> 21:59.767
that he wants.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.333
You can do so many things
with fruit and food

22:03.400 --> 22:05.500
as far as
making it look real.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.167
It's going to be a little bit
more of an advantage for me.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.667
What I had to end up doing

22:12.733 --> 22:15.167
is drawing each one
of these little birds.

22:15.233 --> 22:19.133
And to draw it photo-realistic
has been really, really hard.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.333
James is doing
a whole drawing beforehand.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.333
I honestly
don't understand that.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.067
You're looking at a photo,
you're sketching it here,

22:26.133 --> 22:27.567
and then you're going
to tattoo from your sketch.

22:27.633 --> 22:28.900
There's too many spaces
in there

22:28.967 --> 22:30.200
where you could screw it up.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.700
Can't screw up here
in this competition.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.733
The number one thing
you want to accomplish

22:36.800 --> 22:39.600
with a photo-realistic tattoo
is duplicating the image

22:39.667 --> 22:41.233
as close as possible.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.833
If it's an animal,
landscape, whatever it is,

22:42.900 --> 22:45.200
you need to have the elements
in the exact spaces

22:45.267 --> 22:48.133
from the stencil or you've
screwed yourself from there on.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.900
Once again,
using black and Gray.

22:49.967 --> 22:51.167
Shocking.

22:51.233 --> 22:53.900
Shane hasn't touched
any color since he's been here.

22:53.967 --> 22:56.567
He's done black and gray,
black and gray, black and gray.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.900
To become a Ink Master,
I think it's really

22:59.967 --> 23:02.000
going to have to be shown
that he can do color.

23:02.433 --> 23:03.533
That's [bleep] dope, man.

23:04.433 --> 23:06.167
This is a three-hour call,
everybody.

23:06.233 --> 23:07.033
Halfway done.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.467
Did you go in and get a lot of

23:18.533 --> 23:20.900
actual muscle structure
research done on this?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.200
Yeah, yeah, we did.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.433
We're doing
different levels.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.333
You know, some places,
it's going to show tendons,

23:25.400 --> 23:28.733
some places muscle,
some places bone.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.367
The big thing with photo-realism
is tricking the eye.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.967
You may have a subject
that's not realistic,

23:34.033 --> 23:35.467
but if you can make
the eye perceive

23:35.533 --> 23:37.000
that it's actually there

23:37.067 --> 23:38.633
and not a flat picture
on the skin,

23:38.700 --> 23:39.933
then you've achieved
your goal.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.867
Wanted to do more of
an abstract, artistic opening

23:43.933 --> 23:45.800
to reveal the realism.

23:46.067 --> 23:48.233
In this challenge,
there's a lot of room for error,

23:48.300 --> 23:51.100
just because people,
when trying to do photo-realism,

23:51.167 --> 23:54.467
they try to add
their own artistic eye into it.

23:54.533 --> 23:57.367
It's not lifelike,
it's supposed to be real,

23:57.433 --> 24:00.500
so there's very little room
for [bleep] around.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.367
I'm actually really
struggling with this tattoo.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.400
The flames on Scott
are just not popping.

24:11.467 --> 24:13.500
And I'm trying
different things

24:13.567 --> 24:15.000
to make them stand out.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.500
I'm putting a lot darker shading
than I would normally,

24:17.567 --> 24:19.067
because Scott's skin
is so dark.

24:20.267 --> 24:21.967
Heather's piece,
it's super cartoony.

24:22.033 --> 24:23.300
And it looks almost rushed.

24:23.367 --> 24:25.033
It's one of
the worst pieces for sure.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.000
-You're doing great, man.
-[pained laugh]

24:29.067 --> 24:31.300
-Hurting, huh?
-That is such a sensitive spot.

24:32.167 --> 24:33.433
That one, too.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.100
[Shane] I'm very happy
with the wolf design.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.267
There's a lot of color in it
that I can really play with,

24:37.333 --> 24:39.167
and make it
really bounce off her arm.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.167
It should do well
in the judging.

24:40.833 --> 24:41.567
Having fun yet?

24:42.633 --> 24:43.467
One hour left.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.700
I'm feeling a lot of pain
in my neck

24:48.767 --> 24:50.067
and back and shoulder
right now.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.833
The problem with tattooing
is just, the vibrations,

24:52.900 --> 24:54.167
they go right through
your bones.

24:54.967 --> 24:56.433
I don't know
what Heather's ailment is,

24:56.900 --> 24:58.567
but I've been tattooing
20 years,

24:58.633 --> 25:00.067
and I bend over all day long

25:00.133 --> 25:01.400
and I don't have that much pain.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.800
I think a lot of
the pain she's having

25:03.867 --> 25:04.833
could be all in her head.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.133
Okay, in five,...

25:10.833 --> 25:12.533
four, three,...

25:13.233 --> 25:14.033
two,...

25:14.567 --> 25:15.300
one...

25:15.833 --> 25:17.100
And that's it. Time's up.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.500
Put your machines down.
No more ink.

25:20.767 --> 25:21.867
Alright, girl.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.233
You did [bleep] awesome.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.067
I swear, it looks just like
a bear and two cubs.

25:27.133 --> 25:28.400
I'm such a [bleep] badass that,

25:28.467 --> 25:30.067
even if I reduce my quality,

25:30.133 --> 25:32.100
it's still better
than everybody else.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.500
His tattoo ended up

25:35.567 --> 25:40.133
being a little more traditional
and a little less photo-real.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.233
I think that, although
it's not a realistic subject,

25:42.300 --> 25:43.533
I nailed it when it came to

25:43.600 --> 25:45.167
getting it accurate
and realistic-looking.

25:48.033 --> 25:49.733
[Bleep] fire hat
is stupid as [bleep].

25:50.267 --> 25:51.533
It's so stupid-looking.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.267
I do [bleep] smoking tattoos.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.367
I don't know
what's more sore,

25:57.433 --> 25:59.333
his skin or my eyes.

25:59.867 --> 26:00.967
I want to see competition.

26:01.033 --> 26:02.667
I want to see a star.

26:02.733 --> 26:03.933
I want to see
somebody shine.

26:04.000 --> 26:04.800
I haven't seen it.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.700
[Bili] Like, I would've rocked
the [bleep]

26:13.767 --> 26:15.000
out of that fireman's helmet.

26:15.567 --> 26:18.400
When you have a picture
and then you have a tattoo,

26:18.867 --> 26:19.933
and they don't look
the same...

26:20.533 --> 26:22.100
[Tommy] See, I didn't see
the original picture--

26:22.367 --> 26:23.467
It totally doesn't
look the same.

26:24.867 --> 26:27.100
She had
the fireman's helmet there

26:27.167 --> 26:28.767
and she was able
to take photos of it,

26:28.833 --> 26:30.967
but the work
kind of looks like [bleep].

26:31.533 --> 26:34.067
She said she was going to try
to do the flames realistic.

26:34.133 --> 26:34.933
[Josh] Yeah.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.433
Yeah, but you don't
outline them.

26:36.767 --> 26:37.567
[Bili] She outlined them?

26:37.833 --> 26:38.900
[Tommy] She outlined
the whole thing.

26:39.367 --> 26:40.967
I was trying to help her
with her work last night.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.467
And she was like,
"Ah, it looks perfect.

26:42.533 --> 26:43.467
I'm going to bed."

26:43.533 --> 26:44.967
And I was like,
[bleep] that.

26:45.033 --> 26:46.300
I'm staying,
you know what I mean?

26:46.367 --> 26:47.967
Like, you got $100 thousand
at the end of this trail.

26:48.033 --> 26:49.867
Like, I'm [bleep] fighting
for that [bleep], dude.

26:50.533 --> 26:52.867
Either she wasn't
capable of doing it

26:52.933 --> 26:54.933
or she just really didn't
want to be here tomorrow.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.800
That's what I think.

26:59.833 --> 27:01.467
How you guys think you did
on the challenge?

27:01.533 --> 27:03.433
Definitely comes down
to what people got

27:03.500 --> 27:04.900
and the placement
of it, like...

27:06.067 --> 27:07.867
The [bleep] fire hat's
stupid as [bleep].

27:07.933 --> 27:10.233
It really Is. Like, it looked
like you could [bleep] pick it

27:10.300 --> 27:11.300
off the dude's chest.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.033
That's really not fair.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.033
I thought, that was jt
a low blow on his part.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.300
I don't think I deserve that.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.133
It's so stupid-looking.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.300
Heather's fire helmet,

27:19.367 --> 27:20.600
the whole [bleep]
thing was horrible.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.633
To stay here in the house,
she needs to buck up

27:23.700 --> 27:26.000
and do a much better job
than that.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.067
She dropped the ball.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.300
[Dave] Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.433
This week, we tested
your technical precision skills.

27:45.867 --> 27:46.900
Now it's time to see
how you did

27:46.967 --> 27:48.567
with photo-realistic tattoos.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.200
Josh, you're up first.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.433
-How you feel about this?
-I like it.

28:00.267 --> 28:01.367
He's a great client,

28:01.433 --> 28:03.267
gave me a lot of
artistic freedom. It was fun.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.667
My complaint is
this tattoo looks more

28:05.733 --> 28:07.200
like a pop-art painting.

28:07.267 --> 28:10.233
Artistically illustrated,
other than photo-realistic.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.367
Proportionately,
I think that the...

28:13.433 --> 28:16.300
Avocado seed
looks really large

28:16.367 --> 28:18.133
in proportion to
the rest of the piece.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.933
[Dave] That strawberry is about
the size of that avocado.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.167
That blueberry is enormous.

28:24.233 --> 28:27.000
They're not really
proportioned with one another.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.867
In order to put
good detail in it,

28:28.933 --> 28:31.133
I wanted to make
each fruit larger

28:31.200 --> 28:32.933
so that I could make it
more realistic.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.933
That's not necessarily
"Realistic."

28:39.133 --> 28:39.933
[Dave] Alright, Tommy.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.867
Did she want color
or was that your call?

28:45.933 --> 28:47.800
She never really mentioned
black and gray or color.

28:47.867 --> 28:48.900
She just said,
"Do what you want."

28:49.267 --> 28:51.333
The tricky thing is,
when you start working

28:51.400 --> 28:52.700
with these colors,

28:52.767 --> 28:54.700
in trying to get
a realistic view,

28:54.767 --> 28:56.333
more times than not,
comes out looking

28:56.400 --> 28:59.200
really illustrated
and really like a painting.

28:59.267 --> 29:00.633
And that's kind of
what we got here.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.767
Typically, I work in color.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.933
It seems that's my style
when it comes out.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.233
The only thing that
I would like to have seen

29:06.300 --> 29:08.100
that would have changed
the whole look of this thing,

29:08.167 --> 29:09.967
and probably would have
shut Oliver up,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.900
is if you would have
hit the hairs,

29:12.967 --> 29:14.300
made them more like hairs.

29:14.367 --> 29:15.933
If you would've got
a little trickier in the ear,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.367
'cause the side of the head
and the ear is

29:17.433 --> 29:19.333
where it kind of drifts off
more into a paint style

29:19.400 --> 29:20.433
than a realistic style.

29:21.167 --> 29:22.733
We're getting up
in these last challenges.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.667
We're really
stepping up the notches

29:24.733 --> 29:26.933
into higher and higher
skill levels in tattooing.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.667
And just treading on some
water that's...

29:30.233 --> 29:31.033
pretty deep.

29:38.567 --> 29:39.367
Shane.

29:42.667 --> 29:45.300
This wolf on the left
is unbelievable.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.567
Those eyes look
like they're living.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.667
I love the little
white highlights in their eyes

29:49.733 --> 29:51.633
and their teeth.
It really makes it look real.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.600
I think, when it comes
to photo-realism,

29:53.667 --> 29:55.033
you know,
it's all about texture.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.467
And you hit textures.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.300
All the little hairs there,
you know,

29:58.367 --> 29:59.467
it's nice, man.

29:59.533 --> 30:00.767
Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

30:05.233 --> 30:06.033
James.

30:07.433 --> 30:08.467
How do you feel about this?

30:08.533 --> 30:12.033
Photo-realism's
not really my strong suit.

30:12.100 --> 30:15.233
I drew everything rather than
taking it from a photograph

30:15.300 --> 30:16.767
because every photograph
I found

30:16.833 --> 30:18.733
was basically
from the bottom,

30:18.800 --> 30:20.367
you know, pointing up.

30:20.433 --> 30:23.967
Some of the angles on
the heads look a little bit off.

30:24.033 --> 30:25.967
But I think that's
part of the piecing together

30:26.033 --> 30:28.700
different elements to try to get
a finer result.

30:29.033 --> 30:30.633
I was kind of stacked
against a wall a little bit

30:30.700 --> 30:32.433
with trying to find
photographs.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.600
They do look illustrated.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.467
I think everybody's
going to agree with that.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.433
I just feel like
the weak link of this tattoo

30:38.500 --> 30:40.200
is the background.

30:40.267 --> 30:42.567
There's not any structure
or form

30:42.633 --> 30:44.233
of which way
these clouds are flowing,

30:44.300 --> 30:46.833
it's just kind of like
a spotty shading here and there.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.333
Think you could have used
a lot more planning

30:49.400 --> 30:52.300
with that background to make
this piece hold together.

30:52.367 --> 30:53.633
I just don't think
it hit home.

30:58.733 --> 30:59.533
[Dave] Lea.

31:01.833 --> 31:05.567
This is absolutely
unbelievable.

31:05.633 --> 31:08.300
[Oliver] The detail on the face,
the shading,

31:08.367 --> 31:10.667
everything captures
the personality of this animal.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.700
You have that really cool
other back paw

31:12.767 --> 31:14.233
that comes out to the side,

31:14.900 --> 31:17.867
and that really gives
this leopard a turning flow.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.133
All in all, you executed
a really beautiful tattoo today,

31:21.200 --> 31:24.267
the best one of
this competition for you by far.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.233
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

31:31.033 --> 31:31.833
Heather.

31:34.567 --> 31:35.867
How you feeling
about this piece?

31:35.933 --> 31:38.100
I realized today

31:38.167 --> 31:40.067
I don't really do a whole lot
of photo-realism.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.600
You know,
I kind of do more anime,

31:43.267 --> 31:45.033
animation kind of tattoos.

31:45.100 --> 31:48.400
You had the advantage
of positioning this

31:48.467 --> 31:49.800
and photographing it

31:49.867 --> 31:51.400
with the angle and the light
that you wanted.

31:51.467 --> 31:53.267
Well, I wouldn't say
the angle I wanted

31:53.333 --> 31:54.300
or the light I wanted.

31:54.367 --> 31:55.733
You know what
we're going for here.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.800
I've got to tell you,

31:58.867 --> 32:01.667
I don't really know
what's more sore,

32:01.733 --> 32:03.567
his skin or my eyes.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.333
The numbers
and the letter-forms

32:06.400 --> 32:09.100
look very janky
and don't look very clean.

32:09.167 --> 32:10.933
Well, they were
supposed to be like that,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.267
because they were burned up.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.400
It's rough.
The shading in this is rough.

32:14.467 --> 32:16.200
There's no, like,
gradual anything.

32:16.567 --> 32:17.667
His skin is a little dark,

32:17.733 --> 32:19.433
so I was trying
to compensate for that.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.533
I mean, it looks
like it hurt.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
It looks painful.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.567
[Oliver] Although it is a big,
rugged black helmet,

32:24.867 --> 32:26.700
it just does not
look like...

32:28.133 --> 32:30.067
anything that would exist
in real life.

32:38.267 --> 32:39.067
[Dave] Bili.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Does it feel like
an illustration?

32:46.067 --> 32:48.300
Yes. I think the arteries

32:48.367 --> 32:50.833
or the veins look
a little bit like tendrils,

32:50.900 --> 32:52.467
almost, like, fantastic,

32:52.533 --> 32:54.500
which kind of makes me feel
that it has

32:54.567 --> 32:56.967
more of, like,
a horror, Sci-Fi kind of vibe.

32:57.033 --> 32:59.767
He wanted to avoid
doing torn skin,

32:59.833 --> 33:01.267
he wanted
to avoid stitches,

33:01.333 --> 33:02.700
he wanted to avoid
anything that I could use

33:02.767 --> 33:04.367
to make it
that much more realistic.

33:04.667 --> 33:05.933
I'm not really
blown away by it.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.700
Really, have you achieved
the goal of the challenge

33:08.767 --> 33:10.733
and make something
that's photo-realistic?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.067
No, I don't really
believe so.

33:12.133 --> 33:13.633
I tried to accommodate him
as much as I could

33:13.700 --> 33:15.067
in a way that I thought,
you know,

33:15.133 --> 33:16.733
I could give this guy
a good tattoo.

33:17.033 --> 33:18.067
I just don't think
this tattoo

33:18.133 --> 33:20.033
falls into the category
of photo-realism.

33:26.933 --> 33:28.433
[Chris] This is the part
of the competition

33:28.500 --> 33:29.700
where things heat up

33:30.167 --> 33:32.233
and where
the competition becomes

33:32.300 --> 33:34.833
a lot harder to judge
who's going to go.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.100
Everybody that's left
in this competition

33:37.167 --> 33:38.500
is a major player.

33:38.967 --> 33:41.533
This is the end for everyone,
except one.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.133
[Dave] Alright, guys,

33:44.400 --> 33:45.667
we're gonna make
a decision here,

33:45.733 --> 33:47.367
and once that decision
has been reached,

33:47.833 --> 33:49.033
we will call
four of you back.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.433
I'm [bleep] pissed off, dude.

33:59.933 --> 34:01.367
Lea's getting
all praised like that.

34:01.433 --> 34:02.533
I mean, she did
a nice job, dude.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.100
That tattoo's [bleep] easy.

34:06.267 --> 34:07.067
Whatever.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.000
Now I don't feel so safe.

34:10.067 --> 34:11.433
I did a good tattoo,

34:11.500 --> 34:13.167
and it just wasn't
the right style.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.433
Like, I would hate
to get eliminated like that.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.766
I don't think that's what's
going to happen, dude.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.033
I don't think that's
what's going to happen.

34:20.867 --> 34:21.766
Heather's going home.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.867
She's done crap.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.233
What was
her last good tattoo?

34:27.467 --> 34:28.600
There ain't no way, dude.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.433
Two, there are two
quality tattoos you guys did.

34:32.132 --> 34:35.167
If one of you ain't coming back,
you better make a [bleep] scene.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.699
I'm here for
a competition, man.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.100
And I want to be one of the last
people there, man.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.533
I know that, you know?
And I'm trying my hardest, man.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.199
And I'm [bleep]
staying up all night.

34:52.266 --> 34:53.199
I don't give a [bleep].

34:53.632 --> 34:54.667
I see where
you're coming from.

34:54.733 --> 34:56.266
You know, the longer we go,

34:56.333 --> 34:57.700
I think some of us
are gonna crack.

34:57.767 --> 34:59.367
[Bleep] it, this is
what the [bleep] thing is.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.367
[Heather] If they send me home,
they can suck it.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.267
I do [bleep]
smoking tattoos.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.267
There's some great examples of
technical precision in this one.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.000
I think Shane really
did a great job.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.400
Shane came in and
did those little fine details

35:15.467 --> 35:17.300
that I was looking for

35:17.367 --> 35:19.533
to really replicate
the photo-realism.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.600
He really hit it.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.267
Josh did a great job
with this tattoo,

35:23.333 --> 35:25.867
but his perspective is
way out of whack.

35:26.967 --> 35:29.367
A photo is
a captured moment in time,

35:29.433 --> 35:31.633
a specific millisecond,

35:31.700 --> 35:34.967
and Lea's tattoo
looks like exactly that.

35:35.033 --> 35:37.800
If she flexed
her quad muscles,

35:37.867 --> 35:39.067
you would almost feel like

35:39.133 --> 35:40.833
the snow leopard
was going to move

35:40.900 --> 35:42.600
and, like,
pounce on something.

35:42.967 --> 35:44.100
Tommy hit it, too, man.

35:44.167 --> 35:46.400
My complaint is just,
it's not a photo.

35:46.467 --> 35:48.133
He went from a photo,

35:48.200 --> 35:49.567
but he painted it.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.167
[Dave] Bili's work here...

35:53.867 --> 35:55.100
How many times is this guy

35:55.167 --> 35:56.733
going to have bad luck
with a client?

35:56.800 --> 35:58.733
He can't always
blame the client.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.767
I wish that Bili would've
gotten the fire helmet,

36:00.833 --> 36:02.767
'cause I think
he would've killed it.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.167
The reverse side
of that coin,

36:04.233 --> 36:06.133
if Heather would've got
this muscle structure,

36:06.200 --> 36:07.100
I don't think
she would have done

36:07.167 --> 36:08.333
-as good as Bili did on it.
-No.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.800
Alright, guys,
so I think it's pretty clear

36:09.867 --> 36:11.033
-what we're gonna do.
-Yeah.

36:11.367 --> 36:12.167
-Yeah.
-I agree.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.233
Alright, guys.

36:20.267 --> 36:21.933
-Mr. Peck.
-It's that time again.

36:23.367 --> 36:25.567
We need to see Bili,...

36:27.033 --> 36:27.833
Josh,...

36:28.967 --> 36:29.767
Heather,...

36:30.333 --> 36:31.133
and Lea.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.233
Meet you in the shop.

36:37.733 --> 36:38.667
[Bleep]

36:39.600 --> 36:40.933
Alright, well,
let's just get it over with.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.500
Let's get it over with.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.100
[relieved whistle]

36:55.867 --> 36:58.433
Tonight, we judged
your technical precision skills

36:58.500 --> 36:59.867
with a photo-realistic tattoo.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.267
Unfortunately, for one of you,

37:02.333 --> 37:03.433
this will be
your last night here.

37:05.300 --> 37:06.100
It's getting thinned out.

37:06.567 --> 37:07.467
Less and less people.

37:07.933 --> 37:09.933
That means the better
you're going to have to do

37:10.500 --> 37:13.167
at executing the challenges
set for you.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.000
The less people there are,

37:15.067 --> 37:16.233
the less leeway
there's gonna be.

37:16.733 --> 37:19.800
So concentrate
on what the challenge is.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.300
Let's start with you, Lea.

37:24.300 --> 37:25.633
Congratulations.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.167
The judges feel that tonight
you had the best tattoo.

37:28.900 --> 37:29.700
Well done.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.000
You really captured
the aspect of the photo

37:33.067 --> 37:35.167
and, for this challenge,

37:35.233 --> 37:36.867
you did exactly
what was asked of you.

37:37.467 --> 37:38.233
Thank you.

37:42.067 --> 37:45.200
Josh, do you feel you
deserve to be here right now?

37:45.267 --> 37:47.200
I guess it depends
on what you're gonna tell me.

37:48.067 --> 37:49.133
I thought that it looked

37:49.200 --> 37:51.467
like a really, really nice
oil painting.

37:53.267 --> 37:56.167
But it didn't capture
a photo-realistic sense

37:56.233 --> 37:57.400
of what the challenge
asked for.

37:57.467 --> 38:00.633
I think I did a good,
clean, realistic tattoo.

38:00.700 --> 38:02.833
I don't think that
anybody can say

38:02.900 --> 38:05.067
that the strawberry doesn't
look like a strawberry.

38:05.133 --> 38:06.300
-It does.
-Yeah.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.033
It's just, the proportions
and everything,

38:08.100 --> 38:09.433
to make it photo-realistic.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.733
So you would do a strawberry

38:11.633 --> 38:13.700
that little on a hand
and leave the rest of it?

38:13.767 --> 38:14.733
Maybe three.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.100
Maybe some grouped over
each other,

38:16.167 --> 38:17.567
to make it
a little more interesting.

38:17.633 --> 38:18.667
If we took a photograph,

38:19.267 --> 38:21.133
that wouldn't be the way
the photograph would be,

38:21.200 --> 38:23.367
and it was based on
photo-realism.

38:23.433 --> 38:24.533
It just didn't hit the mark.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.567
Bili, why do you think
you're here?

38:31.467 --> 38:32.800
It's an organic piece.

38:32.867 --> 38:33.967
I think that's
why I'm up here.

38:34.033 --> 38:35.267
[Todd] It's definitely
a different take

38:35.333 --> 38:36.433
than what I would expect.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.867
I was expecting

38:37.933 --> 38:39.200
something a little bit
more clinical and medical.

38:39.267 --> 38:40.700
[Bili] You know,
it's made up realism.

38:40.767 --> 38:42.300
But I still tried
to incorporate that

38:42.367 --> 38:43.500
into the realism
by, you know,

38:43.567 --> 38:45.167
adding the cast shadows
and drop shadows

38:45.233 --> 38:46.200
to, you know,
to give it depth.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.767
In terms of what the challenge
was, photo-realism,

38:48.833 --> 38:50.233
I just think
it missed its mark.

38:50.300 --> 38:51.267
Just the card I was dealt.

38:54.767 --> 38:55.567
Heather.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.533
I definitely did not like
this tattoo at all.

38:59.133 --> 39:01.433
I don't think this is
an Ink Master piece.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.400
It's more like
an Ink Disaster piece.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.300
The tattoo doesn't come even
close to being photo-realistic.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.333
There's a lot of elements
that could have

39:10.400 --> 39:11.633
made it look more real.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.400
And I just think you just
missed the mark completely.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.900
This is a... this is not
a good one out of you.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.833
I'm just tired
and exhausted, and...

39:20.533 --> 39:22.733
But a true Ink Master
has got to be able

39:22.800 --> 39:25.133
to do every kind of tattoo
equally well.

39:25.633 --> 39:27.833
To hold that title
is something that, like--

39:27.900 --> 39:29.833
you've got to excel
in every type of genre.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.633
I'm not trying
to make excuses.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.333
I could go off on a tangent
about staying up all night

39:34.400 --> 39:35.533
and then tattooing all day.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.000
I pretty much thought
we were all competing.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.700
You've been through
some rough critiques.

39:39.767 --> 39:40.933
This one's
going to get it again.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.300
I want to see competition.

39:42.367 --> 39:44.000
I want to see a star.

39:44.067 --> 39:46.000
I want to see somebody shine.
I haven't seen it.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.433
The judges have decided.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.067
Heather, you do not
have what it takes

40:00.133 --> 40:01.333
to become Ink Master.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.267
Please pack up your machines
and leave.

40:05.067 --> 40:05.867
Bye.

40:07.933 --> 40:12.833
I think to feel like
you're losing is always hard.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.000
I'm a really, really good
tattoo artist.

40:15.067 --> 40:17.000
There's nothing
that I can't do.

40:17.567 --> 40:20.133
To leave... it was hard.

40:21.167 --> 40:21.967
It was hard.

40:24.867 --> 40:27.000
[narrator] On the next episode
of Ink Master...

40:27.067 --> 40:28.267
I'm a shark attack survivor.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.967
I had to actually fight
a shark to get away.

40:31.033 --> 40:33.167
Oh, my god,
this is intense.

40:33.233 --> 40:35.233
I hope I'm not going
to [bleep] it up.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.667
You do black and Gray every
[bleep] tattoo you've done.

40:37.733 --> 40:40.667
Shane hasn't touched
any color since he's been here.

40:40.733 --> 40:42.233
What are you gonna do,
[bleep] fight me?

40:42.767 --> 40:43.533
Game on.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.667
In my head, it's done.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.500
The whole composition
of this tattoo

40:46.567 --> 40:47.867
is just painful for me.

40:47.933 --> 40:50.533
This is probably the most
disappointing tattoo of the day.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.333
-[Chris] What is that stuff?
-That's straight Brown.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.733
Whatever it is,
it's straight wrong.
