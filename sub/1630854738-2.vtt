WEBVTT

00:08.591 --> 00:12.679
So… what's the deal?
Are we doing this or not?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.055
I don't know.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.724
I'm literally wearing <i>this</i>.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.226
Yeah, they're daring us to do it.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.146
Yeah, they didn't think
that messaging through.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.732
Bro, does this count as a lighter?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.025
Uh, yeah.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.237
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm from a famous family.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.698
My cousin did Brett Favre's bathroom.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.243
I'm sorry. I can't do
your Brett Favre bathroom story again.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.955
Guys, we learned about this
in health class.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.540
I think we should just say…

00:41.124 --> 00:41.958
Whoa.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.628
-Babe, are you feeling it?
-I don't think so.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.424
Why is Donkey Kong
a gorilla and not a donkey?

00:51.342 --> 00:52.510
It's a lie.

00:53.762 --> 00:57.057
They based their entire empire on a lie.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.810
Yeah, I'm not feeling it either.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.694
Interesting.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.864
Dude, these old flannels are so dope.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.452
Those are my grandpa's flannels.
He's married to what's-her-name.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.039
Wait… What's her name?!

01:21.998 --> 01:23.208
Hey, who am I?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.002
Your grandpa's body.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.797
It was there. It was gone.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.341
Just like love.

01:32.383 --> 01:35.553
Leia, do you want to hear about
the Donkey Kong conspiracy?

01:36.471 --> 01:37.847
He's a gorilla!

01:38.640 --> 01:41.351
It's kinda like how Sheryl Crow
isn't actually a crow.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.853
Totally.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.273
Grandpa's body's hungry.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.985
I'll get snacks. What do you guys want?

01:51.528 --> 01:52.570
Raisin Bran.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.447
Raisin Bran.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.615
Raisin Bran!

01:56.241 --> 01:57.158
On it.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.371
Wait, what was I getting?

02:02.038 --> 02:03.456
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

02:14.592 --> 02:17.137
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

02:18.096 --> 02:21.224
Well, I just… I don't know
what to do with my evenings anymore

02:21.307 --> 02:23.476
with these summer reruns.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.980
I would murder someone
for a fresh <i>Party of Five</i>.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.108
If I have to sit through
another<i> Grace Under Fire</i> rerun,

02:30.608 --> 02:31.901
I'm gonna root for the fire.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.699
Kitty, I've got the first haul
from my vegetable garden.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.535
Show us your harvest.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.042
Wow!

02:49.961 --> 02:54.549
I am gonna just slice this up
and put it on some burgers.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.593
Doll burgers.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.597
-What are you doing out of the basement?
-Calling it like I see it.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.185
Oh, here's the kitchen. Wild.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.770
Hi!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.190
Clearly.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.153
So… you having fun downstairs
with your new friends?

03:15.236 --> 03:17.280
It's everything I've ever wanted.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.865
Besides Raisin Bran.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.533
Oh, I think we're all out.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.076
What?!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.287
But I… I promised Raisin Bran.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.791
If I don't find some Raisin B,
I'm gonna be alone again!

03:29.751 --> 03:31.044
Are you okay?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.054
Well, now, who wouldn't want
to be your friend?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.847
You are smart and charming.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.226
In fact, you deserve a cookie.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.942
If any of those kids give you guff,

03:54.025 --> 03:56.861
I will grab them
by the back of their collar

03:56.945 --> 03:59.239
-and toss them into next week.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.160
That's right. He can do it too,
now that his shoulder is healed.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.620
Which reminds me,

04:05.703 --> 04:08.456
are you gonna be able to drive me
to physical therapy tomorrow?

04:10.166 --> 04:13.294
Oh. I'm getting my hair done.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.504
But I'll make it work.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.590
Now, dance with me, you big gorilla.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.178
Okay. Good talk.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.936
-I think this is Leia's room.
-Yeah. Where is she?

04:30.019 --> 04:31.020
Huh.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.065
Pretty sensible sleepwear.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.402
Oh no. She's got high blood pressure.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.405
It's her grandparents' room.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.243
Holding this has become less exciting.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.247
It's the mother lode!

04:49.914 --> 04:50.790
I'm goin' in.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.335
Oh, you'd look so good in this, babe.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.921
Like a hot lumberjack.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.674
Makes me wanna do stuff with you
in the woods.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.593
I just pitched a tent.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.722
Bro, this will make it go away.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.476
This is mine now.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.313
Oh, here you guys are.
In my grandparents' room.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.481
The room I've never dared
set foot in my whole life.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.984
-Is it cool that we're up here?
-Yeah, I'm cool.

05:18.067 --> 05:22.071
It's the summer. Let's have fun.
We should do whatever we want. Right?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
Wrong.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.829
-Buh-bye now.
-Get out.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.581
-See you soon.
-Get out.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.875
-Don't be a stranger.
-Get out.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.126
Extra icing.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.836
That was mine.

05:36.919 --> 05:40.089
-We never lock the sliding door.
-We do now.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.177
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.180
Look, I lived through this once before.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.474
And I'm not gonna do this again
without some ground rules.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.851
So you tell your friends,

05:51.934 --> 05:56.105
no eating my food, no drinking my drinks,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.774
and if they go in my room,

05:58.483 --> 06:00.651
my foot goes in their ass.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.864
You know, people keep all kinds of
private things in their bedroom.

06:04.947 --> 06:10.495
My father kept a whip hidden
in my parents' room in case of a burglar.

06:10.578 --> 06:14.749
Also, he had a pair of furry handcuffs,
in case…

06:17.377 --> 06:18.378
Oh dear lord.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
I think they think I'm cooler than I am.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.716
Since I got here, it's been amazing.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.675
We smoked…

06:25.510 --> 06:26.344
a ham,

06:27.011 --> 06:28.388
and we tapped a…

06:29.597 --> 06:30.431
a ham.

06:32.016 --> 06:35.103
I'm worried they're expecting
more ham, you know?

06:36.521 --> 06:39.232
That's an awful lot of ham.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.610
Honey, I think you're putting
too much pressure on yourself.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.405
Why don't you invite them back
for a movie night?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.031
Is nobody listening to me?

06:48.866 --> 06:51.619
I don't know, Grandma.
A movie night? It's not boring?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.871
No, it'll be fun.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.373
We'll do it tomorrow.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.126
We'll rent a movie and make a ham.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.420
Since you kids are so obsessed with it.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.550
-I'll get it!

07:08.886 --> 07:11.264
Hey, which one of you yelled at my kids?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.141
Red, it's for you.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.561
I don't know which ones are yours,
but they deserved it.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.480
Oh, that's Gwen and Nate, and thanks.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.065
I'm sick of yelling at them.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.110
Yesterday, I caught Nate
on the roof trying on rollerblades.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.112
I was pregnant with him for ten months.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.948
The doctor said it was okay,
but I don't think it was.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.411
You moved in next door, right?

07:33.494 --> 07:38.207
I waved at you last week, but you were
washing your hair with the hose, so…

07:38.291 --> 07:41.085
I am Kitty and this is Red.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.880
Oh, I'm Sherri.
And, yeah, my shower head's broke.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.425
Turns out it can't support
the weight of two fully grown adults.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.596
Oh, well, look at you and your hubby
keeping things saucy.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.848
Oh. Actually, the hubby's
out of the picture,

07:53.931 --> 07:56.934
but the guy I've been seeing
is talking about us moving in together.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.603
How long have you been seeing each other?

07:58.686 --> 07:59.812
Two weeks.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.231
Two weeks and he already wants to move in?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.943
Yeah, he's kinda clingy.
I should probably break things off.

08:06.027 --> 08:10.114
It's too bad. He's got it all.
Good looks, good job, blue Miata.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.868
Hey. You guys mind
if I pop this in your microwave?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.786
It'll take a hour if I use mine.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.331
Sure, sure. It's in the kitchen.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.167
Oh. Kitty, you're a sweetheart. And Red…

08:22.043 --> 08:23.002
Yeah.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.466
She has all sorts of things in that bag.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.886
Yeah, she's like a trashy Mary Poppins.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.392
Maybe you're overthinking this.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.979
Could we fast-forward
to the part where you pick a movie?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.898
Oh!

08:43.981 --> 08:46.567
"Fast-forward"! That is clever!

08:46.651 --> 08:48.694
I should send that in to Leno.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.073
It's really important I don't pick
something everyone will think is dorky.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.034
Well, you couldn't pick something dorky
if you tried.

08:55.117 --> 08:58.955
-Come on. What's your favorite movie?
-Um, I guess <i>Free Willy</i>.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.707
Whoa. Dork city!

09:05.044 --> 09:06.546
I'm gonna go ask for some help.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.717
-Stick 'em up!
-Aah! Take my money! Take everything!

09:11.801 --> 09:15.304
My boss never locks her car!
Her license plate says MOVIESLUT!

09:15.388 --> 09:18.474
I know. I don't want to say it.
I'm just letting you know.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.892
Please…

09:19.976 --> 09:22.478
Jay, it's just me. I was joking.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.814
Oh. Yeah.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.275
Me too.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.192
Good one.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.362
-I, um, didn't know you worked here.
-Oh.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.282
Well, I didn't want to brag about
being in show business.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.701
Right. Um…

09:36.784 --> 09:39.745
So I'm trying to find
a cool movie for movie night,

09:39.829 --> 09:42.331
and, not that I'm super worried about it
or anything,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.250
but what's that one movie?

09:44.333 --> 09:48.462
You know, with all the guys
and the place and… the guys?

09:49.046 --> 09:50.923
-Uh, <i>Clerks</i>?
<i>-Clerks</i>, yes!

09:51.007 --> 09:53.843
Get out! I love<i> Clerks.</i>
Kevin Smith, right?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.638
Oh yeah! He was so sexy in that.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.725
Okay. Cool.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.020
Uh, well, let's see if I have it.
Let's see…

10:06.272 --> 10:07.481
Ah, crud, it's out.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.526
Some guy has had it for six weeks.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.279
Yo, Jay. I need your help in the bathroom.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.615
It's a<i> Joe Versus the Volcano </i>situation.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.159
Later, girl.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.666
-Come on, Grandma. We gotta go.
-Oh, just a sec.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.794
Pastor Dave, it's Kitty!

10:28.878 --> 10:31.922
I haven't seen you since the potluck.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.884
That was very unholy.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.057
Hey, Mr. Forman.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.476
Look what I found
in your garden of tiny vegetables.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.935
Baby cucumber.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.646
Give me that.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.523
That is normal-sized.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.569
Don't be embarrassed.
Maybe it's a grower, not a shower.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.659
Anyway, I came by
to talk to you about your flannels.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.243
Can I have one?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.161
Why?

11:02.995 --> 11:07.500
My girlfriend said I looked good in it,
and she's kinda out of my league.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.127
But I love her so much,
and I want to keep her happy.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.087
That's sweet.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.882
I had a similar thing
with my first girlfriend.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.927
You know what her name was?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.387
Get out.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.847
Yes, sir.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.891
Hey, neighbor.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.188
Kitty said until I get
my shower situation fixed,

11:29.271 --> 11:31.357
I can rinse my nooks and crannies
over here.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.901
Well, this is my house too.

11:33.984 --> 11:37.697
So you can just take your crannies home.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
I'm gonna need to borrow a razor too.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.951
Blue Miata is taking me
to dinner at Houlihan's.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.829
When a guy springs for Houlihan's,
you gotta whack the weeds.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.916
Are you sure it's okay

11:48.999 --> 11:51.836
that we're just showing up
at somebody's house to get a movie?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.713
I'm out of options here, Grandma.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.466
What if we get murdered?
Who's gonna turn off the Crock-Pot?

12:04.181 --> 12:05.391
Aw, man!

12:08.519 --> 12:10.521
Halloween snuck up on me again.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.065
Hey, listen. I don't have any candy, man,

12:13.149 --> 12:15.359
but I do have some matches

12:15.443 --> 12:18.446
and a parking ticket from 1975.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.158
Leo. Hi.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.868
Don't you recognize me?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.244
I do.

12:25.911 --> 12:30.583
Yeah. You're dressed like Kitty,
the lady with the house and the hair.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.710
Killer costume, man.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.755
Did you rent the movie <i>Clerks</i>
and not return it?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.882
Are you guys cops?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.884
Leo, focus.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.428
Hey, if you cops are looking
for Leo Focus,

12:42.511 --> 12:44.346
you got the wrong guy, man.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.308
Please, Leo. This is important.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.311
You know what I've been watching
a ton of lately?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.396
<i>The Real World</i>.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.356
Because think about it.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.902
If that's the real world, what's all this?

13:00.070 --> 13:02.156
This might be a dead end.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.244
Wait. Leo, it <i>is</i> Halloween.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.747
And you know what I really want
instead of candy?

13:09.830 --> 13:11.749
The movie <i>Clerks</i>.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.710
Crazy! I got a copy.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.046
I'll get it for you.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.841
-Wait. So how do you know this guy?
-Oh, he just… He's…

13:20.925 --> 13:23.010
It's the usual.
You know, he's an older man

13:23.093 --> 13:27.598
who used to hang out with your dad
and his friends when they were teenagers.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.811
Nah.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.814
They would have said something.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.775
Okay, are you the cops
looking for a movie?

13:38.359 --> 13:39.235
Yes, we are.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.781
-Happy Halloween, man.
-Thank you. Thank you.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.119
There you are.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.248
Leia and I had such a fun afternoon.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.376
Kitty, this house is under attack.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.045
There are teenagers everywhere

13:58.128 --> 14:02.591
and a half-naked lady
swinging her bits around my house.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.636
Oh good. Sherri's using the shower.

14:05.719 --> 14:10.808
Why did you open our house to chaos again?

14:10.891 --> 14:15.020
We had it made.
All the dumbasses were gone!

14:16.564 --> 14:18.065
Well, I miss them.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.527
It's been too quiet
around here for me, Red.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.779
Well, then, get a parrot!

14:24.280 --> 14:27.950
And if that's not enough squawkin'
for you, invite your sister.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.619
I like having Leia visit for the summer.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.162
The house is alive again.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.876
The other day, I walked into the bathroom,
someone had tinkled, left the seat up,

14:36.959 --> 14:39.295
and it made me so happy.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.381
I could do that for you!

14:42.965 --> 14:45.175
Complain all you want,
but these past few weeks

14:45.259 --> 14:47.553
I have seen glimpses of the old Red.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.472
The fire, the passion. I miss him.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.224
He's retired.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.102
But he's still alive.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.812
You can't spend all day

14:56.896 --> 15:00.482
scraping around in your garden,
playing with your tomatoes.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.695
-You love my tomatoes!
-Your tomatoes are small!

15:09.575 --> 15:10.784
Your head is sweaty.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.039
-Your chest is heaving.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.465
Well, so much for a quiet retirement.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.927
There's no more lint in my dryer filter.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.347
Is it safe to come out?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.390
Sherri.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.562
I was taking a shower. When I got done,
you guys were dirty doggin' it,

15:38.646 --> 15:40.940
so I just hunkered down
and rode out the storm.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.692
I told you I heard the toilet flush.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.573
Sorry, I was only up here 'cause I was
getting ready for this mistake of a date.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.783
A date?

15:50.866 --> 15:53.160
Blue Miata, Houliha… Keep up.

15:54.119 --> 15:57.373
But it did give me time to think,
which I never get to do.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.708
I mean, what do I want from my life?

15:59.792 --> 16:00.960
Because I'm pretty sure

16:01.043 --> 16:05.047
hiding in my neighbor's bathroom
listening to old people bang isn't it.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.883
Sounded like somebody was eating
corn on the cob.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.970
What's wrong with me?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.848
Why do I keep making the same mistake
over and over?

16:14.932 --> 16:19.395
Oh, honey. Go easy on yourself.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.064
You have a steady job.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.901
You are raising two wonderful kids
all on your own.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.736
You are amazing.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.115
-Kitty, why are you lying to her?
-Red…

16:31.699 --> 16:32.825
But he's not wrong.

16:32.908 --> 16:36.370
Okay, maybe it's time
to take a break from the fellas

16:36.453 --> 16:38.789
and see what it's like on your own.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.374
Being alone sounds scary.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.710
Well, you're not alone. You've got us.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.627
Us?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.130
You'd think you'd be
in a better mood right now.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.720
Welcome to movie night.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.972
It's gonna be pretty major,
so to kick things off right

16:55.055 --> 16:57.933
I got everyone
their own box of Raisin Bran.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.811
Raisin Bran! Raisin Bran!
Raisin Bran!

17:00.894 --> 17:02.521
Everybody loves it. Remember?

17:02.604 --> 17:05.190
No? Did that not happen?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.152
Oh, you know who loves Raisin Bran?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.653
My cousin who did Brett Favre's--

17:09.737 --> 17:11.155
Do not.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.825
-So what are we watching?
-Uh, my favorite movie.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.744
<i>Clerks, </i>starring Kevin Smith.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.495
I'll take a slice of that.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.749
Okay…

17:24.418 --> 17:27.296
<i>Hey, MTV. I'm Leo, man.</i>

17:27.963 --> 17:29.923
<i>I'm 74 years young,</i>

17:30.007 --> 17:33.135
<i>and I'd be perfect</i>
<i>for </i>The Real World, <i>man.</i>

17:33.218 --> 17:34.219
What's this?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.056
I don't know.
It was supposed to be <i>Clerks.</i>

17:37.139 --> 17:38.640
Fun facts about me.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.103
I've fallen off of
three roller coasters, man.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.107
Well, four, if you count the fourth one.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.111
Uh… forget movies.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.238
Does anyone have
any funny stories to share?

17:54.865 --> 17:55.741
Oh good, Nate.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.536
No. He's choking on the Raisin Bran.
It's too dry.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.163
Give him something to drink.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.208
Forget the straw!

18:05.793 --> 18:07.461
Okay. Drink, baby, drink.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.799
I'm good. It went down.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.345
No, you gotta clear it out like this.
Like…

18:17.846 --> 18:21.558
Leia, you should be an event planner.
This is so fun.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.310
Gah! I'm sorry!

18:24.103 --> 18:26.522
I really wanted this
to be a perfect night.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.440
Forget it.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.318
Leia…

18:33.320 --> 18:34.696
Hey, stop eating that.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.739
I'm hungry!

18:37.449 --> 18:39.910
Yo, drama queen. What was up with that?

18:40.494 --> 18:41.537
I'm a fraud.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.247
I've never even seen <i>Clerks</i>.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.749
My favorite movie is… <i>Free Willy</i>.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.710
It's about a boy.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.046
And his whale.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.965
So?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.467
So he tries to get Willy
back in the ocean.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.554
No. I mean,
why did you melt down in there?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.098
It's just…

19:01.932 --> 19:04.226
I feel like an imposter in this group.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.563
You guys are all so close and so cool,

19:08.397 --> 19:10.274
and I'm just me.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.152
If you're ever doubting yourself,
just remember,

19:13.986 --> 19:15.988
you have a <i>killer</i> basement.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.533
I thought you were gonna say
something way nicer.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.661
You know how boring it is around here?

19:22.744 --> 19:27.374
Last week, we threw a stick in the creek
and tried to hit it with other sticks.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.626
Nate called it Stick Stick.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.591
It's not just about your basement, dummy.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.302
If you're stressing about me, we're good.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.264
And if you're worried about
fitting in with everyone else,

19:42.347 --> 19:44.433
you found the people who don't fit in.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.476
And I am their queen.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.688
Never had a friend like you.

19:50.939 --> 19:51.940
I know.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.401
Guys!

19:54.484 --> 19:56.987
We just found another bag inside this bag.

19:57.946 --> 19:58.989
<i>Bag </i>bag!

20:00.449 --> 20:01.909
I just came up with that.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.958
The stuff in that <i>bag </i>bag was <i>good </i>good.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.004
Not as good as <i>Free Willy.</i> I love it.

20:14.087 --> 20:17.007
Check yourself.
This is just<i> E.T.</i> with a whale.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.345
I know it's not <i>Clerks</i>,
but it's kinda cute, right?

20:21.428 --> 20:24.097
It's like… I'm the boy

20:25.224 --> 20:26.850
and Willy's the rubber band.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.685
I get it now.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.813
Leia, is Willy gonna make it?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.690
Did E.T. make it?

20:35.442 --> 20:36.693
-Come on, Willy.
-Come on.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.611
You can do it.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.321
-You got this. Come on.
-Yes, Willy.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.405
Yeah!

20:40.489 --> 20:41.657
He made it!

20:50.499 --> 20:51.875
This never happened.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.462
Hey, Mr. Forman.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.381
I found this in my van.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.591
Looks like I have a secret admirer.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.593
It's you, isn't it?

21:02.678 --> 21:05.889
It's just a shirt. Don't make it weird.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.057
I'm not.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.103
-Can I call you Uncle Red?
-Get out.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.482
Bye, Uncle Red.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.445
Kitty.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.158
<i>That's </i>what you're wearing
to break up with a guy?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.788
I can't imagine
what you would wear to a pool party.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.584
What? This is my funeral outfit.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.879
It's what I wear
to say goodbye to someone forever.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.426
That's him. Oh God, I'm just so nervous.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.969
I've eaten a ton of my hair.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.888
This was so much higher.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
Well, stop that.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.018
-You are strong.
-Yeah.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.644
-You're independent.
-Yeah.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
You're still young…

21:53.812 --> 21:54.771
-Yeah.
-…ish.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.318
-He is just some guy with a fancy horn.
-Right.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.944
Now, go.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.155
Dump that chump!

22:03.238 --> 22:05.532
That's what they say on <i>Ricki Lake.</i>

22:23.925 --> 22:26.762
I thought it would be fun
for you to see me look this sexy.
