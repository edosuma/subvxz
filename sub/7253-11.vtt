WEBVTT

00:17.852 --> 00:19.311
WHAT IN THE HELL

00:17.852 --> 00:19.311
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.479
I WAS JUST

00:19.353 --> 00:20.479
GETTING SOME COFFEE.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.772
YOU CAME

00:20.521 --> 00:21.772
BEHIND MY COUNTER.

00:21.814 --> 00:22.940
I SAW LORELAI DO IT

00:21.814 --> 00:22.940
THE OTHER DAY.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.817
LORELAI

00:22.982 --> 00:24.817
IS MY FIANCEE.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.027
ONLY PEOPLE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH

00:24.859 --> 00:27.027
ARE ALLOWED BEHIND THE COUNTER?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.654
YES.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.739
WELL, I DON'T REALLY

00:28.696 --> 00:30.739
KNOW YOU THAT WELL, LUKE.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.658
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT YOU DO

00:30.781 --> 00:32.658
FOR A LIVING,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.827
AND I KNOW YOU'RE A SCORPIO,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.827
AND YOU SMELL OKAY,

00:34.869 --> 00:37.162
BUT WE'VE NEVER REALLY CONNECTED

00:34.869 --> 00:37.162
ON A DEEPER LEVEL.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.664
GET OUT FROM BEHIND

00:37.204 --> 00:38.664
MY COUNTER, KIRK.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.166
WELL, NOW

00:38.706 --> 00:41.166
IT'S A DEFINITE NO.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.253
OH, MY GOD.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.253
LOOK WHO'S BACK.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.172
WELL, I BELIEVE IT'S

00:45.295 --> 00:47.172
THOSE ADORABLE GILMORE GIRLS.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.132
MY, HOW WE

00:47.214 --> 00:49.132
HAVE MISSED THEM.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.552
I HEAR THEY'RE DIFFERENT NOW --

00:49.174 --> 00:51.552
A LITTLE SAD.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.552
A LITTLE BROKE.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.345
DON'T YOU TWO

00:51.593 --> 00:53.345
BELIEVE IN JET LAG?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.848
NO WAY. WE'RE STILL FLYING

00:53.387 --> 00:55.848
ON THE ATLANTIC CITY BUZZ.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.017
HEY, HANDSOME.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.017
WERE YOU BAD WHILE I WAS GONE?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.143
I WAS. I WENT TO BED

00:58.058 --> 01:00.143
EVERY NIGHT AT 10:15.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.979
GRANDPA,

01:00.185 --> 01:01.979
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU?

01:02.021 --> 01:03.898
HEY, LUKE.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.898
HEY, RORY.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.358
WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE NOT

01:03.939 --> 01:06.358
BEEN TO BED SINCE WE LEFT.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.943
WE DID FALL OVER ONCE,

01:06.400 --> 01:07.943
THOUGH.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.653
DID YOU HAVE

01:07.985 --> 01:09.653
A GOOD TRIP?

01:09.695 --> 01:11.739
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE BEST

01:09.695 --> 01:11.739
BELATED 21st-BIRTHDAY PARTY

01:11.780 --> 01:13.657
ON RECORD.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.492
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

01:13.699 --> 01:15.492
NO KALUA.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.202
OH, RIGHT.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.202
WHICH REMINDS ME --

01:17.244 --> 01:19.872
SORRY ABOUT ALL THE DRUNKEN

01:17.244 --> 01:19.872
LATE-NIGHT PHONE CALLS.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.999
WHAT DRUNKEN

01:19.914 --> 01:21.999
LATE-NIGHT PHONE CALLS?

01:22.041 --> 01:24.209
UH, SO, UM,

01:22.041 --> 01:24.209
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

01:24.251 --> 01:26.253
ALL THE THINGS WE<i> CAN</i> TELL YOU

01:24.251 --> 01:26.253
ABOUT OUR TRIP?

01:26.294 --> 01:27.713
I'M NOT SURE.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.798
FIRST OF ALL,

01:27.755 --> 01:29.798
VIDEO POKER IS MY CALLING.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.175
I THINK I'M TOTALLY GONNA

01:29.840 --> 01:32.175
DEDICATE MY LIFE TO IT,

01:32.217 --> 01:35.012
ESPECIALLY THE THIRD MACHINE

01:32.217 --> 01:35.012
IN THE SECOND ROW OF MACHINES

01:35.054 --> 01:37.305
AS YOU HIT THE ENTRANCE

01:35.054 --> 01:37.305
OF TRUMP TAJ MAHAL.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.725
I'M MORE OF A ROULETTE GIRL

01:37.347 --> 01:39.725
MYSELF.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.351
AND WE DID THE WHOLE THING

01:39.767 --> 01:41.351
UP RIGHT.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.186
WE DID THE MARTINIS

01:41.393 --> 01:43.186
AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.939
AND WE PRETENDED

01:43.228 --> 01:44.939
I WAS TURNING 21

01:44.980 --> 01:46.440
WHILE WE WERE

01:44.980 --> 01:46.440
PLAYING 21.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.650
AND WE ACTUALLY WON

01:46.481 --> 01:48.650
AND BOUGHT OUR 21 ITEMS.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.444
SHOT GLASSES,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.444
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK COASTERS,

01:50.485 --> 01:51.570
SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS,

01:50.485 --> 01:51.570
PASTIES.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.154
OH, AND LOOK.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.865
WHAT'S THAT?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.865
21 GUYS'

01:53.196 --> 01:54.865
PHONE NUMBERS.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.575
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF

01:54.907 --> 01:56.575
HOW QUICKLY WE GOT THEM

01:56.617 --> 01:58.577
AND ALSO OF THE FACT

01:56.617 --> 01:58.577
THAT NO ONE QUESTIONED US

01:58.619 --> 02:00.245
WHEN WE SAID OUR NAMES

01:58.619 --> 02:00.245
WERE WENDY AND LISA.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.872
SO, TELL ME,

02:01.914 --> 02:03.707
HOW WAS PAUL ANKA --

02:01.914 --> 02:03.707
THE PERSON, NOT THE DOG?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.834
WE DIDN'T

02:03.749 --> 02:05.834
GET TO SEE HIM.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.963
WHY NOT?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.963
HIS SHOW HAD ACTUALLY CLOSED

02:05.876 --> 02:08.963
A WEEK BEFORE WE GOT THERE.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.798
SO, WHO'D YOU

02:09.004 --> 02:10.798
END UP SEEING?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.883
IT CAME DOWN TO JOURNEY WITHOUT

02:10.839 --> 02:12.883
THEIR ORIGINAL LEAD SINGER,

02:12.925 --> 02:14.927
INXS WITHOUT

02:12.925 --> 02:14.927
THEIR ORIGINAL LEAD SINGER,

02:14.969 --> 02:16.971
QUEEN WITHOUT

02:14.969 --> 02:16.971
THEIR ORIGINAL LEAD SINGER,

02:17.012 --> 02:18.806
THE SUPREMES WITHOUT DIANA,

02:18.847 --> 02:21.850
AND, WEIRDLY, THE JAMES BROWN

02:18.847 --> 02:21.850
BAND WITHOUT JAMES BROWN.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.103
BUT WE WOUND UP SEEING

02:21.892 --> 02:24.103
TONY DANZA, WHO WAS SUBLIME.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.771
OH, THE TAP DANCING.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.356
WHY "TAXI" NEVER UTILIZED

02:25.813 --> 02:28.356
HIS MUSICAL-COMEDY SKILLS

02:28.398 --> 02:29.399
IS ASTONISHING.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.943
SOUNDS GREAT.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.778
OH, AND WE SNAGGED YOU

02:30.985 --> 02:32.778
A PAUL ANKA T-SHIRT.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.613
HAD SOME LEFT OVER.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.990
WEAR IT TONIGHT.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.199
OKAY.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.199
I'M MAKING YOU BURGERS.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.161
WAIT, WAIT. YOU HAVEN'T

02:38.241 --> 02:41.161
SEEN THE BEST PART YET.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.997
WE WERE WALKING...

02:43.038 --> 02:45.749
SORT OF WALKING, SORT OF DRUNK

02:43.038 --> 02:45.749
GIRLS IN HIGH HEELS STUMBLING.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.584
...DOWN THE STREET,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.584
AND WE SEE THIS GUY.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.670
AND, LUKE, MY HAND TO GOD,

02:47.626 --> 02:49.670
IT'S YOU.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.463
IT'S TOTALLY YOU.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.463
LUKE 2.0.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
WE CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
YOUR DOPPELGANGER, MY FRIEND.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.216
SO WE FOLLOWED HIM.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.216
YEAH, 'CAUSE WE<i> HAD</i> TO.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.176
HE WENT INTO THIS NIGHTCLUB,

02:55.258 --> 02:57.176
SO WE FOLLOWED HIM.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.387
'CAUSE WE'RE STALKERS OBSESSED

02:57.218 --> 02:59.387
WITH GETTING HIS PICTURE.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.683
WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH THIS

02:59.429 --> 03:02.683
GRUNGY PLACE. HE GOES BACKSTAGE.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.309
'CAUSE HE'S IN THE BIZ.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.020
WE SNEAK BEHIND THE CURTAIN,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.020
AND WE TRACK HIM DOWN.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.813
WE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT YOU, AND

03:06.061 --> 03:07.813
THEN I SHOWED HIM YOUR PICTURE,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.272
AND HE TOTALLY

03:07.855 --> 03:09.272
FREAKED OUT.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.735
LUKE, I WANT YOU

03:09.314 --> 03:13.735
TO MEET DEREK McKINNEY,

03:13.777 --> 03:15.278

03:13.777 --> 03:15.278

03:15.320 --> 03:17.280
THIS IS A MAN

03:15.320 --> 03:17.280
DRESSED LIKE DOLLY PARTON.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.658
YOU SHOULD HEAR HIM

03:17.322 --> 03:19.658
DO "JOLENE" -- AMAZING.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.409
YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE

03:19.700 --> 03:21.409
A GUY DRESSED AS DOLLY PARTON?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.746
A LITTLE LESS WITH THE MAKEUP,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.746
BUT CHECK OUT THE CHINS.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.748

04:29.519 --> 04:31.438

04:31.479 --> 04:34.315
FOR THE VERY LONG 30-MINUTE

04:31.479 --> 04:34.315
DRIVE BACK TO SCHOOL?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.568
THANK GOD. I DON'T THINK

04:34.357 --> 04:36.568
I WOULD HAVE MADE IT.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.653
DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.653
I THINK SO.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.155
[ GASPS ]

04:38.695 --> 04:40.155
OH, NO!

04:40.197 --> 04:42.116
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:40.197 --> 04:42.116
WHY DO YOU HATE THE BOXES?

04:42.157 --> 04:45.202
OH, NO!

04:42.157 --> 04:45.202
OH, NO! OH, NO!

04:45.244 --> 04:48.205
I ACCIDENTALLY FORGOT TO TURN IN

04:45.244 --> 04:48.205
MY COMMUNITY-SERVICE VEST.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.664
SO?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.875
SO THIS VEST

04:49.706 --> 04:51.875
BELONGS TO THE STATE.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.752
I HAVE NOW STOLEN

04:51.917 --> 04:53.752
STATE PROPERTY.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.420
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE ME

04:53.794 --> 04:55.420
COMMUNITY SERVICE

04:55.462 --> 04:57.589
FOR STEALING

04:55.462 --> 04:57.589
MY COMMUNITY-SERVICE VEST.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.008
HAND ME THE VEST. I WILL

04:57.631 --> 05:00.008
DELIVER IT TO THE STATE, OKAY?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.261
WHAT'S NEXT

05:00.050 --> 05:02.261
ON YOUR AGENDA?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.096
I'M JUST GONNA HEAD STRAIGHT

05:02.302 --> 05:04.096
OVER TO PARIS' APARTMENT.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.599
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA

05:04.138 --> 05:07.599
LIVE WITH PARIS AGAIN -- AGAIN.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.684
SHE'S GOT AN EMPTY ROOM,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.684
AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.437
THE HOUSING ON CAMPUS IS TAKEN,

05:09.726 --> 05:12.437
SO IT'S THAT OR A CARDBOARD BOX.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.189
OKAY, BUT HOW BIG

05:12.479 --> 05:14.189
A CARDBOARD BOX?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.276
AFTER I DUMP MY STUFF AT PARIS',

05:14.231 --> 05:17.276
I HAVE TO HIT CAMPUS.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.236
I HAVE TO ADD TWO COURSES

05:17.317 --> 05:19.236
TO MY SCHEDULE

05:19.278 --> 05:21.071
IF I'M GONNA MAKE UP ALL

05:19.278 --> 05:21.071
THE WORK I'VE MISSED THIS YEAR.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.864
YOU DON'T HAVE TO

05:21.113 --> 05:22.864
MAKE UP EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.533
I DO IF I WANT TO GRADUATE

05:22.906 --> 05:25.533
THE SAME TIME I WOULD HAVE.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.328
I HAVE TONS OF BOOKS TO BUY.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.328
I HAVE A MEETING WITH THE DEAN.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.372
AND, OF COURSE, I HAVE A MEETING

05:28.369 --> 05:31.372
WITH THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.209
BACK UP. I'M SORRY.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.209
YOU -- A MEETING WITH WHO?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.044
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.044

15:57.290 --> 15:59.166
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

16:04.714 --> 16:06.591

16:04.714 --> 16:06.591
WE'RE DONE WITH WHAT?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.927
WITH THE WEDDING PREPARATIONS.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.927
WE'RE ALL DONE.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.470
WHAT?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.096
I JUST DROPPED OFF

16:10.511 --> 16:12.096
A DEPOSIT CHECK TO THE CATERER,

16:12.138 --> 16:13.807
AND I BROUGHT YOU SOME

16:12.138 --> 16:13.807
DUCK-SAUSAGE ROLLS, BY THE WAY.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.600
DUCK-SAUSAGE ROLLS.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.685
THEY SOUNDED WEIRD TO ME, TOO,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.685
BUT THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.186
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.186
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

16:19.228 --> 16:20.814
THIS MORNING,

16:19.228 --> 16:20.814
YOU DIDN'T KNOW

16:20.855 --> 16:22.565
WHETHER YOU WERE GONNA WEAR

16:20.855 --> 16:22.565
A WHITE DRESS OR NOT.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.151
BUT THEN SOOKIE AND WENT TO

16:22.607 --> 16:25.151
CHECK OUT THESE INVITATIONS,

16:25.192 --> 16:27.654
AND RIGHT NEXT DOOR, THERE WAS

16:25.192 --> 16:27.654
THIS LITTLE BRIDAL SHOP.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.824
AND WE THOUGHT, "WE'LL JUST GO

16:27.695 --> 16:30.824
IN, LOOK AROUND, NO BIG DEAL."

16:30.865 --> 16:32.617
JUST GIRL FUN, RIGHT?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.744
AND I WENT IN,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.744
AND I TURNED AROUND,

16:34.786 --> 16:36.955
AND THERE IT WAS --

16:34.786 --> 16:36.955
THE PERFECT DRESS.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.507
GOES INTO A TRAIN.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.010
AND, OH,

16:47.548 --> 16:51.010
IT HAS A CREAM, SATIN SASH,

16:51.051 --> 16:52.386

WHICH I KNOW

16:52.428 --> 16:53.972
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.389
I TRIED IT ON,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.389
AND IT FIT ME PERFECTLY,

16:55.431 --> 16:57.475
AND IT WAS ON SALE,

16:55.431 --> 16:57.475
AND SO I BOUGHT IT.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.185
AND FROM THE MINUTE

16:57.517 --> 16:59.185
I BOUGHT THE DRESS,

16:59.226 --> 17:01.228

16:59.226 --> 17:01.228
FELL INTO PLACE.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.856
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS

17:10.947 --> 17:12.615
A LITTLE GIRLY,

17:12.657 --> 17:15.159
BUT, SERIOUSLY, THERE ARE

17:12.657 --> 17:15.159
NO MACHO WEDDING INVITATIONS,

17:15.201 --> 17:16.911
SO PLEASE JUST

17:15.201 --> 17:16.911
GIVE ME THIS ONE, OKAY?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.579
OKAY.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.498
SO I BOUGHT THE INVITATIONS.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.498
THE PLACE IS RUNNING A SPECIAL.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.500
THEY PRINT THE INVITES

17:20.540 --> 17:22.500
AND MAIL THEM FOR YOU

17:22.542 --> 17:25.127
AND HANDLE THE RSVP LIST,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.127
SO THAT'S DONE.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.587
THEN WE GO

17:25.169 --> 17:26.587
TO GET SOME COFFEE,

17:26.629 --> 17:28.172
AND IN THE WINDOW

17:26.629 --> 17:28.172
OF THE COFFEE SHOP,

17:28.214 --> 17:31.676
THERE IS A PICTURE OF A

17:28.214 --> 17:31.676
BEAUTIFUL ROSE-COVERED CHURCH.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.094
I THOUGHT, "GEE, THAT'S PRETTY.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.094
I WONDER WHERE THAT IS."

17:34.136 --> 17:35.346
AND DO YOU KNOW

17:34.136 --> 17:35.346
WHERE IT IS?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.723
NO.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.265
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER

17:36.764 --> 17:38.265
FROM THE COFFEE SHOP.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.559
SO WE WENT IN

17:38.307 --> 17:39.559
AND TALKED TO PASTOR TODD.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.101
PASTOR TODD?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.062
AND OUT BACK,

17:41.143 --> 17:43.062
THERE'S A SEPARATE FUNCTION HALL

17:43.103 --> 17:46.440

17:46.482 --> 17:48.943
AND BEHIND THE HALL

17:46.482 --> 17:48.943
IS THIS OLD CARROUSEL.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.110
A CARROUSEL?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.696
FROM 1850.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.781
AND IT SHOULD BE FULLY RESTORED

17:51.738 --> 17:53.781
AND WORKING BY JUNE 3rd,

17:53.823 --> 17:55.533
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

17:53.823 --> 17:55.533
IS THE DATE OF OUR WEDDING.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.910
JUNE 3rd?

17:56.951 --> 17:59.412
YES. WHICH IS ALSO

17:56.951 --> 17:59.412
MIRACULOUSLY A DATE

17:59.453 --> 18:01.831
THAT NO ONE IN STARS HOLLOW

17:59.453 --> 18:01.831
HAS A CONFLICT WITH,

18:01.873 --> 18:03.499
AND THE PASTOR

18:01.873 --> 18:03.499
WAS RUNNING A SPECIAL.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.585
A SPECIAL?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.585
YEAH.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.585
I RENTED THE CHURCH.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.420
AND HE GAVE ME THE HALL

18:05.626 --> 18:07.420
FOR HALF PRICE,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.756
AND HE THREW IN THE USE

18:07.461 --> 18:09.756
OF THE CARROUSEL FOR NOTHING.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.466
AND HIS SISTER RUNS A CATERING

18:09.797 --> 18:12.466
COMPANY, AND SOOKIE BLESSED IT,

18:12.508 --> 18:14.385
AND SO BASICALLY THAT'S IT --

18:12.508 --> 18:14.385
WE'RE DONE.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.221
IT WAS SO WEIRD

18:14.427 --> 18:17.221
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.473
IT'S LIKE THE DRESS WAS A SIGN

18:17.263 --> 18:19.473
OR SOMETHING.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.934
THERE ARE NO SIGNS.

THAT, MY FRIEND,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.649

THAT IS NOT A SIGN.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.902

BUT I'M THINKING

21:23.490 --> 21:25.492
I MAY NOT EVEN USE IT

21:25.534 --> 21:27.620
'CAUSE THE STAIRS

21:25.534 --> 21:27.620
ARE EXCELLENT EXERCISE.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.457
AND I LOVE HAVING A HALLWAY.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.457
I'VE NEVER HAD A HALLWAY BEFORE.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.334
AND I AM REALLY LUCKY

21:31.498 --> 21:34.334
THAT PARIS AND DOYLE

21:34.376 --> 21:36.921
HADN'T RENTED OUT

21:34.376 --> 21:36.921
THAT OTHER ROOM YET.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.715
I MEAN, THIS LOCATION

21:36.963 --> 21:39.715
IS REALLY IN DEMAND.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.217
REALLY?

21:39.757 --> 21:41.217
OH, YEAH.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.594
I MEAN, IT IS LITERALLY

21:41.259 --> 21:43.594
10 MINUTES FROM CAMPUS.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.680
YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'M GONNA HAVE

21:43.636 --> 21:46.680
TO WORK TO BE LATE FOR CLASS?

21:46.722 --> 21:50.309
THOSE GUYS DOWN THERE --

21:46.722 --> 21:50.309
ARE THEY YOUR NEIGHBORS?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.895
UM, NO.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.895
THEY'RE A DOO-WOP GROUP.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.856
YOU HAVE SOME PLUTONIUM

21:52.937 --> 21:55.856
BACK THERE OR SOMETHING?

21:55.898 --> 21:58.067
UH, NO, JUST PARIS.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.067
SHE'S QUIRKY.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.902
OKAY,

21:58.109 --> 21:59.902
WELCOME TO MY PLACE.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.487
NO.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.656
MOM, GIVE IT A CHANCE.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.656
NO.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.616
LOOK, WE HAVE

22:03.697 --> 22:05.616
A REALLY BIG LIVING ROOM.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.201
NO.

22:07.243 --> 22:10.246
IT JUST LOOKS RUNDOWN,

22:07.243 --> 22:10.246
BUT EVERYTHING WORKS FINE.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.247
NO!

22:10.288 --> 22:11.247
MOM.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.665
NO.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
OKAY, TOUR'S OVER.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
TIME FOR LUNCH.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.002
NO.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.462
LET'S GO.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.462
NO. NO.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.257
Doyle:

22:18.504 --> 22:21.257
SAROYAN! SAROYAN!

22:21.299 --> 22:22.341
AAH!

22:22.382 --> 22:24.969
NO, NO, NO.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.969
OKAY. OKAY.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.514
IT'S VERY NICE.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.514
IT'S ONE OF A KIND.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.391
WILL YOU TAKE $250?

22:28.555 --> 22:31.391
IT DOES HAVE SOME NICKS.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.061
THAT CHAIR IS 200 YEARS OLD.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.061
IT'S GONNA HAVE SOME NICKS.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.562
IT SAT IN

22:34.103 --> 22:35.562
JAMES MADISON'S BEDROOM.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.273
THIS CHAIR

22:35.604 --> 22:37.273
IS A PIECE OF HISTORY.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.025
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ALLOWED

22:37.315 --> 22:39.025
TO SELL IT TO YOU.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.693
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN

22:39.066 --> 22:40.693
TO INSULT YOU.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.444
YOU DIDN'T INSULT ME.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.613
YOU INSULTED THE CHAIR AND

22:42.486 --> 22:44.613
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.364
ALL RIGHT.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.364
$300's FINE.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.450
FORGET IT.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.450
THAT'S WHAT

22:46.406 --> 22:48.450
THE PRICE TAG SAYS.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.411
THE PRICE JUST WENT UP. IF YOU

22:48.492 --> 22:51.411
WANT THE CHAIR, IT'S $350.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.498
IF YOU DON'T, PLEASE LEAVE.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.498
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.666
BYE.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.626
$350 -- HERE.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.626
DO YOU TAKE CASH?

22:57.668 --> 22:59.128
EXACT CHANGE ONLY.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.505
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE

22:59.170 --> 23:01.505
A DELIVERY SERVICE.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.342
OH, THAT'S OKAY. I'LL --

23:01.547 --> 23:04.342
I'LL TAKE IT WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.848
YOU FORGOT TO KICK HER IN

23:08.512 --> 23:10.848
THE PANTS AS SHE WALKED OUT.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.432
I MADE THE SALE,

23:10.890 --> 23:12.432
DIDN'T I?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.434
YES, BUT WITH LESS BITE,

23:12.474 --> 23:14.434
A CUSTOMER MIGHT COME BACK.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.978
YOU ALWAYS

23:14.476 --> 23:15.978
DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.938
YES, I DO.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.938
WE DO HAVE A DELIVERY SERVICE.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.815
YEAH, ME IN A MINIVAN --

23:17.980 --> 23:19.815
NOT IN THE MOOD,

23:19.857 --> 23:22.026
NO MATTER HOW EXCITING

23:19.857 --> 23:22.026
THE PROSPECT OF A $2 TIP IS.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.611
TOO BAD IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS --

23:22.068 --> 23:24.611
THAT SMILEY FACE OF YOURS

23:24.653 --> 23:27.156
WOULD CHEER UP CHILDREN

23:24.653 --> 23:27.156
FOR MILES AROUND.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.701
ZACH. ZACH.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.371
YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE JUST TO

23:30.743 --> 23:33.371
WALK INTO MY PLACE LIKE THIS.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.497
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:33.411 --> 23:35.497
THIS IS A PLACE OF BUSINESS.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.874
MAYBE I WANT TO BUY

23:35.539 --> 23:36.874
SOME ANTIQUES.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.334
OH, RIGHT!

23:38.376 --> 23:40.418
YOU'RE NOT

23:38.376 --> 23:40.418
WEARING YOUR GLASSES ANYMORE.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.005
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ZACH?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.005
I THINK YOU

23:40.460 --> 23:43.005
HAVE A CD OF MINE.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.422
WHAT CD?

23:44.464 --> 23:45.799
THE ONE WITH

23:44.464 --> 23:45.799
A CRAZY-LOOKING CHICK ON IT.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.509
I DON'T HAVE

23:45.841 --> 23:47.509
ANY OF YOUR CDs, ZACH.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.345
I CAN GO UP TO YOUR ROOM

23:47.551 --> 23:49.345
AND CHECK.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.014
NO! ZACH, YOU CAN'T

23:49.387 --> 23:52.014
GO UP TO MY ROOM AND CHECK.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.766
IF I FIND A CD WITH

23:52.056 --> 23:53.766
A CRAZY-LOOKING CHICK ON IT,

23:53.807 --> 23:55.893
I'LL MAIL IT TO YOU.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.521
SERIOUSLY, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS

23:55.935 --> 23:59.521
AND LOOK NOW.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.521
I'M WORKING, ZACH.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.275
I CAN TELL THERE'S A MAJOR RUSH

23:59.563 --> 24:02.275
ON ANCIENT CRAP GOING ON.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.442
BYE, ZACH!

24:02.316 --> 24:04.442
FIVE MINUTES, LANE.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.444
OUT, ZACH!

24:04.484 --> 24:06.444
IT'S MY FAVORITE CD.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.197
OUT!

24:06.486 --> 24:08.197
FINE!

24:10.490 --> 24:12.993
HEY, YOU BREAK IT,

24:10.490 --> 24:12.993
YOU BUY IT!

24:13.035 --> 24:15.746
OH, RORY.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.746
COME ON.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.746
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.331
IT'S "ANGELA'S ASHES."

24:15.788 --> 24:17.331
IT'S BASIC.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.083
IT'S "SANFORD AND SON."

24:19.125 --> 24:22.086
MOM, THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS SAFE.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.086
A TON OF KIDS LIVE THERE.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.004
AND THEY HAVE A SAFETY VAN

24:22.128 --> 24:24.004
THAT GOES TO AND FROM CAMPUS,

24:24.046 --> 24:25.672
SO I DON'T HAVE TO

24:24.046 --> 24:25.672
WALK HOME AT NIGHT.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.591
THAT WASN'T A DOO-WOP GROUP,

24:25.714 --> 24:27.591
WAS IT?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.591
NO.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.677
LET'S CALL DADDY, MAKE HIM PAY

24:27.633 --> 24:30.677
FOR AN APARTMENT WITH ONE LOCK.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.347
NO. LOOK, THIS IS THE WAY

24:30.719 --> 24:33.347
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.224
I AM IN COLLEGE.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.224
DON'T YOU SEE?

24:35.266 --> 24:37.143
I'M SUPPOSED TO

24:35.266 --> 24:37.143
LIVE IN A CRAPPY APARTMENT.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.103
I'M SUPPOSED TO EAT

24:37.184 --> 24:39.103
RAMEN NOODLES

24:39.145 --> 24:40.938
AND MAC AND CHEESE

24:39.145 --> 24:40.938
FOR MONTHS.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.274
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN A POOL HOUSE

24:40.980 --> 24:43.274
WITH MAIDS

24:43.316 --> 24:46.693
AND FRESH-CUT FLOWERS AND MINTS

24:43.316 --> 24:46.693
ON MY PILLOW EVERY NIGHT.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.195
YOU GOT TO LOVE MY MOTHER

24:46.735 --> 24:48.195
SOMETIMES.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.406
THIS IS GOOD AND RIGHT,

24:48.237 --> 24:50.406
AND I'M HAPPY,

24:50.448 --> 24:53.951
AND I HAVE ROOMMATES WHO

24:50.448 --> 24:53.951
ARE LEARNING TO KILL PEOPLE.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.494
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.494
HOW ARE THE WEDDING PLANS GOING?

24:56.536 --> 24:58.247
DONE. ALL DONE.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.247
WHAT?

24:58.289 --> 25:00.333
THE DRESS, THE CAKE,

24:58.289 --> 25:00.333
THE PLACE, THE INVITATIONS.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.499
JUNE 3rd, BY THE WAY.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.002
WOW.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.295
I ALSO BOUGHT

25:03.043 --> 25:04.295
YOUR DRESS AND SHOES.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.921
HOW DID ALL THIS HAPPEN?

25:05.963 --> 25:07.423
WELL,

25:05.963 --> 25:07.423
I FOUND THIS DRESS,

25:07.465 --> 25:09.883
WHICH, AT THE TIME,

25:07.465 --> 25:09.883
SEEMED LIKE THE PERFECT DRESS.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.510
AND FROM THE DRESS, ALL THE

25:09.925 --> 25:12.510
OTHER DETAILS FELL INTO PLACE.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.347
THAT'S GREAT.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.347
IS IT?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.890
ISN'T IT?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.890
I DON'T KNOW.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.890
SURE, I THOUGHT IT WAS.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.685
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SIGN OR

25:16.932 --> 25:19.685
SOMETHING -- FINDING THE DRESS.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.270
THEN WHEN

25:19.726 --> 25:21.270
IT STARTED TO SNOW,

25:21.312 --> 25:23.605
I WAS LIKE, "SOMEBODY'S

25:21.312 --> 25:23.605
TELLING ME SOMETHING."

25:23.647 --> 25:26.108
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.108
THEN I STARTED THINKING.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.943
UH-OH.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.943
IT WAS ALL TOO EASY.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.821
PLANNING A WEDDING SHOULDN'T BE

25:27.985 --> 25:30.821
EASY BECAUSE MARRIAGE ISN'T.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.365
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

25:30.863 --> 25:32.365
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.907
EXACTLY.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.035
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MARRIED

25:33.949 --> 25:36.035
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY,

25:36.076 --> 25:38.037
AND I USUALLY FREAK OUT

25:36.076 --> 25:38.037
AND SCREW EVERYTHING UP.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.913
I FREAKED OUT AND SCREWED

25:38.078 --> 25:39.913
EVERYTHING UP WITH MAX.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.540
YEAH, BUT--

25:39.955 --> 25:42.540
BUT I HAVEN'T FREAKED OUT

25:39.955 --> 25:42.540
ABOUT LUKE YET.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.293
WHY HAVEN'T I

25:42.582 --> 25:44.293
FREAKED OUT ABOUT LUKE YET?

25:44.335 --> 25:45.794
IT'S WHAT I DO,

25:44.335 --> 25:45.794
AND THEN I STARTED FREAKING OUT

25:45.836 --> 25:47.338
ABOUT THE FACT

25:45.836 --> 25:47.338
THAT I HADN'T FREAKED OUT.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.423
YOU GOT CAUGHT

25:47.380 --> 25:49.423
IN THE CIRCLE OF FREAK OUT.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.343
WHAT IF THIS DRESS IS REALLY

25:49.465 --> 25:52.343
A BAD SIGN, NOT A GOOD SIGN?

25:52.385 --> 25:55.012
WHAT IF THE DRESS IS TELLING ME

25:52.385 --> 25:55.012
THAT IT'S SO RIGHT, IT'S WRONG?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.348
MOM--

25:55.054 --> 25:57.348
WHAT IF I'M ABOUT TO BAIL OUT

25:55.054 --> 25:57.348
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT?

25:57.390 --> 25:59.183
YOU ARE

25:57.390 --> 25:59.183
DRIVING YOURSELF CRAZY.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.559
WHAT IF ALL THE SIGNS ARE SAYING

25:59.225 --> 26:01.559
THINGS SHOULDN'T BE THIS EASY,

26:01.601 --> 26:03.521
THAT I SHOULDN'T

26:01.601 --> 26:03.521
GET THE GUY I WANT?

26:03.561 --> 26:05.939
WHAT IF IT'S LIKE THAT

26:03.561 --> 26:05.939
"TWILIGHT ZONE" WHERE

26:03.561 --> 26:05.939
THE WOMAN ON A HORSE

26:05.981 --> 26:07.649
IS BEING CHASED

26:05.981 --> 26:07.649
BY ANOTHER WOMAN ON A HORSE

26:07.691 --> 26:09.943
WHO TURNS OUT IS OLDER HER

26:07.691 --> 26:09.943
CHASING YOUNGER HER,

26:09.985 --> 26:12.196
TRYING TO TELL HER

26:09.985 --> 26:12.196
THAT SHE SHOULD NOT RUN OFF

26:12.238 --> 26:14.198
WITH THE GUY

26:12.238 --> 26:14.198
SHE'S GOING TO RUN OFF WITH

26:14.240 --> 26:16.116
BECAUSE IT WILL BE

26:14.240 --> 26:16.116
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.952
KING GEORGE, TAKE A BREATH,

26:16.158 --> 26:18.952
EAT A FRY, AND LISTEN TO ME.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.454
THE DRESS

26:18.994 --> 26:20.454
IS A GOOD SIGN.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.456
EVERYTHING FELL INTO PLACE

26:20.496 --> 26:22.456
