WEBVTT

00:41.097 --> 00:43.444
May I ask you something?

00:43.478 --> 00:46.102
I can't promise I'll answer.

00:47.655 --> 00:51.383
R... right, that's exactly
what I meant.

00:51.417 --> 00:55.145
Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?

00:55.180 --> 00:57.975
I was thinking
there might be rules.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.770
Let me put it this way

00:59.805 --> 01:04.188
very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.

01:04.223 --> 01:07.606
People are overcome with
a strange and sudden need

01:07.640 --> 01:10.298
to confess on these trips.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.473
And not all of it
can be said to be

01:12.507 --> 01:15.096
of great rhetorical quality

01:15.131 --> 01:18.444
but do carry on merrily

01:18.479 --> 01:21.654
just don't believe you're
going to tell me something

01:21.689 --> 01:23.725
I haven't heard before.

01:33.459 --> 01:36.186
I will tentatively
divide my tale

01:36.221 --> 01:39.534
into five randomly
chosen incidents

01:39.569 --> 01:41.743
over a twelve-year period.

02:08.529 --> 02:12.049
So I'm standing here
holding this jack

02:12.084 --> 02:14.569
crap's not working.

02:14.604 --> 02:17.193
Do you, uh, do you have a jack
I could borrow?

02:17.227 --> 02:19.505
No, I'm sorry.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.024
- No?
- No

02:21.058 --> 02:22.715
- No?
- No

02:24.372 --> 02:28.135
That's odd,
I thought everyone had a jack.

02:28.169 --> 02:30.033
I don't.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.553
Perhaps you could
have a look at my car?

02:34.210 --> 02:37.868
Well, I don't have to
have a look at your car.

02:37.903 --> 02:40.768
The issue with your jack
is it's broken.

02:40.802 --> 02:42.045
There.

02:44.668 --> 02:49.604
So, uh, what's a person
like me supposed to do?

02:49.639 --> 02:53.470
Well, I suppose

02:53.505 --> 02:57.371
I could, uh, drive over
to Sonny's repair shop

02:57.405 --> 02:59.821
and call for roadside
assistance.

02:59.856 --> 03:03.170
It's about, uh,
five miles from here.

03:03.204 --> 03:04.654
What kind of repair shop is it?

03:04.688 --> 03:07.001
It's... it's..
Sonny's a blacksmith, very good one.

03:07.035 --> 03:09.279
Blacksmith.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.076
Well, maybe this Sonny can
repair the jack?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.147
You'd have to talk to Sonny
about that.

03:16.562 --> 03:19.738
Perhaps, I could entice you
to drive me there?

03:19.772 --> 03:21.912
- Please.
- Um..

03:44.038 --> 03:46.937
Oops, that was a mistake.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.595
Mistake?

03:49.630 --> 03:52.288
Me getting in this car
with you.

03:52.322 --> 03:53.472
What was it one's mother
used to say

03:53.496 --> 03:56.775
about not getting into cars
with strangers?

03:56.809 --> 03:58.984
Well..

03:59.018 --> 04:01.814
I wouldn't know what
your mother said.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.471
You might as well be
a serial killer.

04:05.059 --> 04:07.130
I'm sorry but you do kind of
look like one.

04:09.028 --> 04:10.754
You'd like me
to drive you back to your car?

04:12.308 --> 04:14.931
No, no.
I can take care of myself.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.762
I'm sorry,
were you offended

04:18.797 --> 04:20.625
that I called you
a serial killer?

04:21.869 --> 04:22.973
No.

04:24.251 --> 04:27.081
It's of absolutely
no importance to me.

04:30.464 --> 04:32.742
Maybe it's just the van.

04:32.776 --> 04:36.263
It's the kind one might expect
to be kidnapped in

04:36.297 --> 04:38.817
or used to transport corpses.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.648
But if you really were
a serial killer

04:42.683 --> 04:43.970
I guess the easiest thing
would be just

04:43.994 --> 04:48.930
to bury my body back up there
by those trees

04:48.965 --> 04:51.174
but you'd have to remember
to dig six feet down

04:51.208 --> 04:53.314
so the foxes couldn't
dig up my grave.

04:55.627 --> 04:58.388
What would I do?

04:58.423 --> 05:01.288
What would I do to keep you
from getting away with it?

05:02.979 --> 05:06.293
Of course, I'd just

05:06.327 --> 05:09.330
pick up that jack and hit you
over the head with it.

05:09.365 --> 05:11.194
A jack like that can do quite
a bit of damage

05:11.228 --> 05:12.437
don't you think?

05:14.818 --> 05:16.544
I'm not a medical examiner.

05:16.579 --> 05:18.960
It'd do quite a lot of damage.

05:39.602 --> 05:43.433
Don't forget this.
Good luck with Sonny.

05:43.468 --> 05:47.092
Um, would it be too much to ask
for you to drive me back?

05:47.126 --> 05:49.128
If this Sonny is as fast as
you say he is?

05:51.890 --> 05:54.168
I'm sure Sonny is perfectly
capable of giving you

05:54.202 --> 05:55.687
a lift back to your..

05:55.721 --> 05:57.792
As... as I told you before,
I don't like

05:57.827 --> 05:59.138
driving with strangers.

06:01.037 --> 06:03.453
Well, I'm just as much of
a stranger as Sonny is.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.868
Oh, getting along just fine.

06:04.903 --> 06:06.783
I'll just go speak to Sonny,
just take a moment.

06:19.573 --> 06:20.850
Sonny.

06:22.127 --> 06:23.887
Hi, Jack.

06:23.922 --> 06:25.026
How's it going?

06:25.061 --> 06:26.994
Well, I was working
on Miller's tractor

06:27.028 --> 06:30.273
but this lady is being
really persistent.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.343
You don't say.

06:42.181 --> 06:44.839
Big mistake.

06:44.874 --> 06:47.300
The reason serial killers can
roam around free in our country

06:47.324 --> 06:50.673
is that they have no connection
between themselves

06:50.707 --> 06:52.260
and their victims.

06:52.295 --> 06:54.815
So, you just made
a big mistake

06:54.849 --> 06:56.713
letting Sonny see
the two of us together.

07:08.691 --> 07:11.418
You know..

07:11.452 --> 07:14.386
...honestly,
I have more important things

07:14.421 --> 07:16.595
to be doing with my life

07:16.630 --> 07:19.115
than messing around
with this crap.

07:19.149 --> 07:21.635
You... you said
he was really good.

07:21.669 --> 07:23.844
Yeah, well,
I'm sure Sonny was just

07:23.878 --> 07:26.985
distracted by your
goddamned blabbering.

07:27.019 --> 07:29.228
Now I have to go,
I have an appointment.

07:29.263 --> 07:30.782
Appointment,
what appointment?

07:34.164 --> 07:36.235
That's none of your goddamn
business now, is it?

07:38.065 --> 07:40.239
You're not just gonna
leave me here.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.621
In fact, yes, that is kind of
what I was thinking.

07:45.106 --> 07:48.351
I'm sure there will be another
serial killer passing by

07:48.385 --> 07:50.629
who can give you a lift
back to Sonny's.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.808
That is, unless he decides
to kill you first.

07:59.051 --> 08:01.882
Even if I was to beg you
to drive me back?

08:01.916 --> 08:03.470
Just a last time?

08:04.712 --> 08:06.196
Pretty please.

08:20.728 --> 08:22.696
You know,
I take it all back

08:22.730 --> 08:26.044
what I said earlier about you
looking like a serial killer.

08:26.078 --> 08:28.771
No, no, no,
you don't have the disposition

08:28.805 --> 08:30.048
for that sort of thing.

08:31.532 --> 08:34.846
You're way too much
of a wimp to murder anyone.

08:51.172 --> 08:54.451
Oh, dear,
you are a dangerous man

08:54.486 --> 08:57.800
smacked her with a jack,
did you?

08:57.834 --> 09:00.147
Honestly, I've heard of
more murders

09:00.181 --> 09:02.908
than I can count.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.635
And by the way,
what does this ridiculous man

09:05.670 --> 09:07.706
have to do with anything?

09:07.741 --> 09:09.881
It's Glenn Gould

09:09.915 --> 09:12.539
one of the greatest piano
players of our time.

09:14.023 --> 09:15.921
He represents art.

09:20.616 --> 09:23.860
So a jack in the face of

09:23.895 --> 09:28.106
an admittedly unbearable lady
was great art.

09:28.140 --> 09:31.523
Is that what I'm to make of it?

09:31.558 --> 09:34.975
Dear Mr. Verge,
please give me a chance

09:35.009 --> 09:38.979
to cast some supplemental
light on the story of the jack.

09:39.013 --> 09:42.776
The old cathedrals often have
sublime artworks hidden away

09:42.810 --> 09:46.124
in the darkest corners
for only God to see

09:46.158 --> 09:48.713
or whatever
one feels like calling

09:48.747 --> 09:50.853
the great architect
behind it all.

09:52.302 --> 09:54.097
The same goes for murder.

09:58.343 --> 10:00.621
When I say cathedrals

10:00.656 --> 10:05.108
it is first and foremost the
gothic buildings we admire.

10:05.143 --> 10:08.525
Here elegant, pointed arches
have replaced the earlier

10:08.560 --> 10:11.494
more primitive rounded arches.

10:11.528 --> 10:15.636
The art of engineering is first
and foremost about statics

10:15.671 --> 10:18.432
that is so things remain
standing in spite of

10:18.466 --> 10:21.677
the various forces that impact
the buildings.

10:21.711 --> 10:26.474
In this way, the pointed arch
created a possibility to build

10:26.509 --> 10:29.823
much higher
and with much more light

10:29.857 --> 10:33.896
but most importantly
with less use of material.

10:33.930 --> 10:37.347
I often say that
the material does the work.

10:37.382 --> 10:40.868
In other words it has
a kind of will of its own

10:40.903 --> 10:44.044
and by following it,
the result will be

10:44.078 --> 10:45.459
the most exquisite.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.394
So the material was the jack

10:49.428 --> 10:53.156
and it jumped into the lady's
face on its own.

10:54.951 --> 10:56.643
Art is many things.

10:58.196 --> 11:00.819
Very convenient and unusual

11:00.854 --> 11:03.442
in the pile of bad excuses.

11:03.477 --> 11:06.204
But all of that
is of no interest whatsoever

11:06.238 --> 11:08.344
unless you're an engineer.

11:09.621 --> 11:11.105
I am an engineer.

11:19.113 --> 11:22.151
My mother was of the opinion
that becoming an engineer

11:22.185 --> 11:26.189
was the more financially
viable choice

11:26.224 --> 11:29.572
but my really big dream
was to become an architect.

11:35.164 --> 11:37.131
Right before the lady
and the jack

11:37.166 --> 11:38.926
I purchased a building lot

11:38.961 --> 11:42.067
and since
I was my own developer

11:42.102 --> 11:44.725
due to a substantial
inheritance

11:44.760 --> 11:47.624
no one could keep me
from drawing up

11:47.659 --> 11:50.662
my own plans
for my own house.

11:56.737 --> 12:00.223
Engineer or architect

12:00.258 --> 12:04.158
what I see is an OCD patient
in full bloom.

12:04.193 --> 12:07.058
Ordnungszwang Jack

12:07.092 --> 12:10.406
to use a good German word.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.029
Yes, perhaps, it is
in any case true

12:13.064 --> 12:16.377
that I suffered from
compulsions as a child.

12:16.412 --> 12:19.656
I was completely hysterical
about cleaning

12:19.691 --> 12:21.797
and could never leave
a room that wasn't

12:21.831 --> 12:23.764
perfectly neat and clean.

12:23.799 --> 12:26.698
A standard that was
difficult to maintain

12:26.733 --> 12:28.873
in the walk-in freezer.

12:28.907 --> 12:31.358
The walk-in freezer?

12:31.392 --> 12:34.119
The walk-in freezer
on Prospect Avenue.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.433
The sign has been broken
for forever

12:37.467 --> 12:40.263
so no one really knew what
the name of the street was.

13:09.361 --> 13:11.536
I bought the pizzas
from the former owner

13:11.570 --> 13:13.745
of the walk-in freezer.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.989
He claimed it was a great deal

13:16.023 --> 13:18.439
but of course I never managed
to sell them

13:18.474 --> 13:21.546
so it all became
too much for me.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.135
I only ate one of those
shitty pizzas.

13:26.689 --> 13:28.449
Pizza, pizza!

13:38.666 --> 13:41.704
And then there was a door
to another room

13:41.738 --> 13:44.293
which I never managed to open.

13:53.681 --> 13:57.754
A fucking neurotic riddled
with obsessive compulsions

13:57.789 --> 14:00.896
and a pathetic dream
of something greater.

14:18.810 --> 14:20.363
And what about the police?

14:20.398 --> 14:23.677
I imagine they started
coming around a lot.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.822
No, call it luck
if you will.

14:32.099 --> 14:34.343
I had attempted
to hide her car..

14:37.001 --> 14:39.589
...but to my great annoyance

14:39.624 --> 14:43.007
you could still catch a glimpse
of it from the main road.

14:45.941 --> 14:48.944
You know, without realizing
where I had parked the car

14:48.978 --> 14:50.669
was a stroke of genius.

14:50.704 --> 14:54.225
You see, the small brook
defines the state border

14:54.259 --> 14:55.951
and the local police,
per definition

14:55.985 --> 14:58.056
can't see across state lines.

14:58.091 --> 14:59.713
It's not their jurisdiction.

14:59.747 --> 15:02.785
So I had no inquiries
from the police.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.236
And by the way,
I don't even know if Sonny

15:05.270 --> 15:06.720
had told them about me.

15:06.754 --> 15:08.964
We met up quite
a few times since

15:08.998 --> 15:11.069
but never spoke of it.

16:43.092 --> 16:44.438
Hang on.

16:48.304 --> 16:49.961
Hi.

16:49.996 --> 16:50.997
Hi.

16:52.619 --> 16:54.517
Who are you?

16:54.552 --> 16:55.656
Police.

16:57.900 --> 16:58.901
Did something happen?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.213
Oh, no, no, no

17:00.247 --> 17:03.630
luckily nothing exactly
has happened as of yet.

17:03.664 --> 17:05.563
I understand that
you are fond of

17:05.597 --> 17:09.912
shopping at
Carlson's Supermarket.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.810
Why? Did something happen
at Carlson's?

17:11.845 --> 17:16.505
No, uh, however
we'd like to, uh, prevent

17:16.539 --> 17:20.542
things from happening
to businesses in the vicinity

17:20.578 --> 17:25.340
like Carlson's Supermarket.

17:26.894 --> 17:30.001
Yeah, may... may,
may I come in?

17:30.036 --> 17:32.279
I'd like to see
a police badge.

17:34.626 --> 17:35.903
So would I.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.184
Unfortunately, that today

17:40.218 --> 17:42.531
is going to be a bit of
a problem.

17:42.565 --> 17:44.429
Now, ahem..

17:44.464 --> 17:47.674
...I can tell by your expression

17:47.708 --> 17:49.020
that you think it's a bad thing

17:49.055 --> 17:52.196
that I don't have my police
badge on me.

17:52.230 --> 17:53.231
Right.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.415
Well, I'm here to tell you that

17:54.439 --> 17:55.992
it's a, it's a good thing..

17:58.236 --> 17:59.651
...for the police department

17:59.686 --> 18:01.653
and I'm not going to
lie to you, okay?

18:01.688 --> 18:03.183
It also happens to be
a good thing for me

18:03.207 --> 18:06.002
on a personal level. Yeah.

18:06.037 --> 18:10.317
You see my... my badge

18:10.352 --> 18:13.458
it's, uh, at the silversmith.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.426
Yeah, it's at the,
the silversmith.

18:15.460 --> 18:20.086
They're... they're shining it up
and, ah..

18:21.880 --> 18:25.401
...adding a few additional
citations to it.

18:25.436 --> 18:26.989
I've been promoted.

18:30.820 --> 18:33.029
- Okay.
- Right.

18:33.064 --> 18:35.031
So now you're..

18:35.066 --> 18:36.757
Now... now what are you?

18:36.792 --> 18:39.622
Like, what's your,
what's your rank now?

18:41.003 --> 18:43.626
We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

18:43.661 --> 18:46.284
Ah, that's considered
classified information.

18:46.319 --> 18:50.461
However, I think this is safe
to say that

18:50.495 --> 18:51.945
it's a considerable..

18:54.154 --> 18:55.397
...leap up the ladder.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.918
- Uh, ahem, now may I...
- No.

18:59.953 --> 19:02.438
Not without a badge.

19:03.646 --> 19:06.753
Bravo, bravo, bravo,
that's excellent.

19:06.787 --> 19:10.170
That's exactly just the type of
response we like to see.

19:10.205 --> 19:14.174
- You say no, that makes my day.
- Right.

19:14.209 --> 19:17.419
Of course, everybody's always
talking about security

19:17.453 --> 19:19.800
but what... what is actually
anybody doing about it?

19:19.835 --> 19:22.389
No, is quite
the correct answer.

19:22.424 --> 19:24.874
Yeah, it's quite
the correct answer indeed.

19:24.909 --> 19:28.430
Of course you'll never allow
somebody in your home

19:28.464 --> 19:31.053
just because they say,
"Oh, I'm a police officer."

19:31.087 --> 19:32.848
No. No, no, no.
You don't do that.

19:32.882 --> 19:34.574
No.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.817
You wait until they show you
the proper..

19:36.852 --> 19:40.096
- Badge.
- Yeah. The badge.

19:40.131 --> 19:42.651
- Yup.
- That's correct. Yeah.

19:42.685 --> 19:43.755
Um..

19:45.895 --> 19:49.278
May I, uh, ask you a..

19:50.348 --> 19:53.800
...ah, somewhat
personal question?

19:53.834 --> 19:57.252
Um, when exactly

19:57.286 --> 20:00.186
was it that you lost your,
your husband?

20:01.670 --> 20:05.708
It was just over
six months ago

20:05.743 --> 20:08.159
that my husband passed..

20:08.194 --> 20:09.885
Where are you going with this?

20:09.919 --> 20:12.750
Oh, I'm just thinking
about your..

20:12.784 --> 20:15.753
Your pension, yeah.

20:15.787 --> 20:18.687
I bet with a simple phone call
to one of my colleagues

20:18.721 --> 20:21.586
down in headquarters,
I could get you a, ah..

20:21.621 --> 20:24.037
...considerable increase
in your pension.

20:24.071 --> 20:25.970
I bet that I could,
I could double

20:26.004 --> 20:27.592
what you're currently receiving.

20:29.801 --> 20:31.389
Wait a minute.

20:33.322 --> 20:36.152
You could get me
double my pension

20:36.187 --> 20:38.154
from the police department
by calling people?

20:38.189 --> 20:40.674
Uh, forgive me, uh, uh..

20:40.709 --> 20:44.299
...I, I've tricked you, a bit.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.267
In fact, as it, as it stands

20:47.302 --> 20:50.960
I'm not,
I'm not a police officer.

20:50.995 --> 20:52.376
What?

20:52.410 --> 20:55.344
I'm an insurance agent, lady.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.313
The, the whole story
that I told you about the badge

20:58.347 --> 21:02.834
that's, t-that's something
that we've been asked to do

21:02.869 --> 21:06.459
by the authorities,
it's, it's for statistical

21:06.493 --> 21:08.323
purposes or something.

21:09.496 --> 21:12.050
- Hi, Glenn.
- Hi, Claire.

21:12.085 --> 21:14.639
- It's my friend Glenn.
- Glenn. Yeah, great guy.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.469
- You know Glenn?
- Yeah, sure.

21:16.503 --> 21:18.712
Uh, listen, are you interested

21:18.747 --> 21:21.336
in this, this increase,
uh, the money?

21:22.647 --> 21:24.615
Well, if you can double it.

21:24.649 --> 21:27.203
It won't take more than
a few minutes of your time.

21:27.238 --> 21:29.999
Alright, listen,
you can come in.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.347
This damn door sticks.

21:32.381 --> 21:34.152
I mean, what the heck's
the worst that could happen

21:34.176 --> 21:36.282
as long as you can
double my pension.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.666
Damn it.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.874
Something wrong?

21:45.498 --> 21:47.603
This is so damn humiliating.

21:50.157 --> 21:53.989
You know being forced
to, to stand out there

21:54.023 --> 21:57.717
exposed, time and time again

21:57.751 --> 22:01.997
have to be
put in these situations

22:02.031 --> 22:03.136
I don't know why.

22:03.170 --> 22:05.587
Listen, I'm sorry,
uh, I-I.. I was jus..

22:05.621 --> 22:07.623
You know
how humiliating it is?

22:07.658 --> 22:12.145
I am constantly being
put in these situations.

22:12.179 --> 22:13.629
It's just not fair.

22:13.664 --> 22:14.906
- No.
- Do you think it's fair?

22:14.941 --> 22:17.495
- No.
- No.

22:17.530 --> 22:18.748
Do you want me
to get you a cup of tea?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.706
Nah, nah, nah.
Don't worry about it.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.576
Ow! Fuck.

22:29.611 --> 22:33.891
Ow! Fuck. Ah, fuck. Fuck.

22:35.962 --> 22:37.757
The hell do you think
you're going?

23:22.146 --> 23:25.667
Oh, no. Oh, no.

23:30.085 --> 23:31.914
Here.

23:31.949 --> 23:33.433
Put this under your head.

23:37.506 --> 23:39.612
I'm sorry. Ow.

23:47.413 --> 23:50.381
I'm so sorry.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.142
Oh..

23:54.489 --> 23:56.525
What can I do
to make this good again?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.221
- What can I do?
- Ugh!

24:03.256 --> 24:05.120
How can I help you?

24:05.154 --> 24:06.432
What can I do
to make it better?

24:08.123 --> 24:10.643
- Speak to me?
- Talk..

24:10.677 --> 24:12.921
- Can't talk? Okay.
- Can't.

24:27.936 --> 24:29.627
Hold on a second.

24:29.662 --> 24:33.251
I have something else I think
you're gonna like quite a bit.

24:33.286 --> 24:35.702
Do you like donuts?

24:40.120 --> 24:41.121
Shh.

24:46.126 --> 24:48.266
Have here..

24:50.924 --> 24:51.925
Here we go.

24:55.066 --> 24:57.344
Yes, chamomile.

24:58.138 --> 24:59.346
It's good for you.

25:20.609 --> 25:22.404
Jesus Chri..

29:18.778 --> 29:21.781
A murderer with OCD.

29:21.816 --> 29:24.611
It's almost ridiculous

29:24.646 --> 29:26.821
but how unfortunate
for you, Jack.

29:26.855 --> 29:30.859
And to top it off,
with cleaning compulsions.

31:35.432 --> 31:36.743
Shit.

33:53.604 --> 33:55.123
Please get out of the car, sir.

34:09.379 --> 34:11.418
Do you mind if I take a look
in the van please, sir?

34:15.212 --> 34:18.215
- I'd be a bad guy if I said no.
- Alright, open her up, please.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.389
Okay.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.088
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
been a minor break-in

34:29.123 --> 34:31.539
down the street just now.

34:31.572 --> 34:32.826
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

34:32.850 --> 34:35.922
about anything you may
have seen or heard, yeah?

34:35.956 --> 34:39.098
Glenn said you were
visiting Claire.

34:39.132 --> 34:41.755
I'm sorry y... you said something ab...
about a break-in?

34:41.790 --> 34:43.137
- Uh-huh.
- Well..

34:44.310 --> 34:48.728
Well, unfortunately
I think you've got

34:48.763 --> 34:50.696
a more serious problem.

34:51.628 --> 34:54.907
Claire, she's disappeared.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.049
Clair Miller has disappeared?

34:59.084 --> 35:02.363
Yeah, I've been,
uh, sitting out here

35:02.397 --> 35:05.642
for the last two hours
in my van waiting for her.

35:05.676 --> 35:07.092
Right.

35:07.126 --> 35:09.577
You see, ahem,
I contacted Claire

35:09.611 --> 35:13.581
because, uh, her late husband
was a dear friend of mine.

35:13.615 --> 35:15.169
We worked together
for number of years

35:15.203 --> 35:18.620
on the railroad
and, uh, I'm a collector.

35:18.655 --> 35:20.139
Yeah, I collect.

35:20.174 --> 35:23.349
Uh, I collect Trax.

35:23.384 --> 35:24.523
- Trax?
- Old issues of Trax.

35:24.557 --> 35:28.285
It's a, uh, publication
owned by the railroad

35:28.320 --> 35:31.702
and, uh, Jerry, uh

35:31.737 --> 35:33.497
I know, I happen
to know for a fact

35:33.532 --> 35:36.707
that he also subscribed
and was an enthusiast

35:36.742 --> 35:38.606
such as myself.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.850
So Claire said
she'd run inside

35:41.885 --> 35:43.369
and see if she could rustle up

35:43.404 --> 35:46.303
a couple of back issues for me.

35:46.338 --> 35:47.960
She didn't ask me in.

35:47.994 --> 35:48.995
Right.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.687
Better safe than sorry

35:50.721 --> 35:53.759
when an oddball like myself
just turns up, right?

35:53.793 --> 35:56.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:56.900 --> 36:01.629
So I knocked several times
and, uh, she hasn't answered.

36:01.663 --> 36:03.941
Okay.

36:03.976 --> 36:07.048
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to stay right here.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.843
I'm just gonna go take a look.

36:24.445 --> 36:26.654
Claire, it's Ed.

36:29.691 --> 36:32.280
- Maybe the door is open.
- What?

36:33.074 --> 36:35.180
Or maybe not.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.413
Claire, you here?

37:06.107 --> 37:07.350
Claire?

37:14.184 --> 37:15.679
- Is she up there?
- No, she's not up there.

37:15.703 --> 37:17.912
Maybe she went out
through the back.

37:17.946 --> 37:20.880
I, I think
I would have noticed that.

37:20.915 --> 37:25.402
Uh, this is really,
really strange.

37:25.437 --> 37:26.852
If you ask me, I'd say

37:26.886 --> 37:29.613
that this needs to be
thoroughly investigated.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.028
Right, well
I'm not askin' you.

37:31.063 --> 37:33.548
You know, I have to say,
also, that I heard

37:33.583 --> 37:38.312
uh, some noises coming
from... the living room.

37:38.346 --> 37:40.279
- Noises?
- Yeah, some noises.

37:40.314 --> 37:42.971
I, I, of course, I can't be sure

37:43.006 --> 37:44.973
but it sounded
a little bit like a..

37:45.008 --> 37:46.803
Like a scuffle of some kind.

37:46.837 --> 37:48.770
Scuffle?

37:48.805 --> 37:51.428
No, no, no. You're gonna have
to put that back down, now.

37:51.463 --> 37:54.259
Sir, that kind of investigation,
that's for police, don't.

37:54.293 --> 37:55.570
Right, right.

37:55.605 --> 37:58.263
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the house.

37:58.297 --> 38:01.404
- I'm sorry?
- Sir, now!

38:01.438 --> 38:03.302
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

38:03.337 --> 38:05.511
You know, I'm gonna
do so under protest.

38:05.546 --> 38:09.032
I, I feel like
that my observations

38:09.066 --> 38:12.587
well, they could be of use
in an investigation.

38:12.622 --> 38:15.728
As a tax-paying citizen,
someone who is fully aware

38:15.763 --> 38:17.454
of my constitutional rights.

38:17.489 --> 38:18.731
What?

38:18.766 --> 38:21.320
O... officer, please
allow me to finish

38:21.355 --> 38:24.116
I'm just trying to be
of assistance, okay?

38:24.150 --> 38:25.196
You've got one minute, sir.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.843
I would like
to recommend one thing

38:26.877 --> 38:28.707
and it's within my right,

38:28.741 --> 38:32.849
that this room
is inspected impeccably.

38:34.402 --> 38:38.510
With a magnifying glass
if you catch my drift.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.892
- Get out.
- Have a nice day, officer.

38:41.927 --> 38:43.377
Get out, sir.

39:36.084 --> 39:41.158
♪ Fame fame makes a man
take things over ♪

39:41.193 --> 39:45.991
♪ Fame fame lets him loose
hard to swallow ♪

39:46.025 --> 39:51.168
♪ Fame fame puts you there
where things are hollow ♪

39:51.203 --> 39:53.136
♪ Fame ♪ Fame ♪

39:55.966 --> 39:58.106
Don't the police officers
in your story

39:58.141 --> 40:00.661
seem exceptionally naive?

40:00.695 --> 40:02.939
Is that the point?

40:02.973 --> 40:07.668
No, but here it comes,
the point that is.

40:07.702 --> 40:09.635
I can hardly wait.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.613
The great rain!

40:23.477 --> 40:27.066
It washed away the long track
from my escape.

40:29.724 --> 40:31.416
Now, I don't consider myself

40:31.450 --> 40:34.522
a decidedly
devoted man of faith.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.974
Which, of course, is a
totally crazy thing to say

40:38.008 --> 40:41.080
considering
our present situation

40:41.115 --> 40:43.497
but I must admit..

40:43.531 --> 40:47.259
...I experienced the rain,
the fiercest I have ever seen

40:47.293 --> 40:50.642
as a kind of a blessing.

40:50.676 --> 40:54.542
And the murder
as a kind of liberation.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.200
I felt I had
a higher protector.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.895
And in the reality you were

41:02.930 --> 41:05.864
just a terrifying
perverted Satan.

41:15.460 --> 41:19.981
But, did you understand,
or even better, did you accept

41:20.016 --> 41:23.502
the connection
to your own personality?

41:23.537 --> 41:27.126
That you yourself
were a psychopath?

41:35.031 --> 41:36.929
Well, I'm not stupid.

41:39.484 --> 41:41.244
That's rather unusual.

41:41.278 --> 41:43.453
The psychopath
will never accept

41:43.488 --> 41:45.559
his own diagnosis.

41:48.285 --> 41:50.149
But I did!

41:50.184 --> 41:52.427
For instance,
the psychopath's

41:52.462 --> 41:54.913
lack of empathy.

41:54.947 --> 41:58.917
I went to great lengths
to fake normal empathy..

41:58.951 --> 42:02.127
...in order to hide
amongst the masses.

42:02.161 --> 42:04.543
Smile.

42:06.856 --> 42:09.928
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

42:16.072 --> 42:17.418
Disappointed.

42:18.868 --> 42:22.147
Very, very disappointed.

42:37.887 --> 42:42.961

42:47.966 --> 42:49.105
♪ Fame fame.. ♪

42:49.139 --> 42:50.555
And the reeds?

42:51.763 --> 42:54.731
I was a very sensitive child..

42:54.766 --> 42:57.596
...profoundly
afraid of playing.

42:57.631 --> 42:59.943
For example, hide and seek.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.566
In the case of hide

43:01.600 --> 43:04.603
I always chose to run
in near panic

43:04.638 --> 43:07.917
into a field
of reeds to hide.

43:07.951 --> 43:11.817
I see something
other than a scared kid.

43:11.852 --> 43:15.580
I see a kid with a more
mysterious goal.

43:15.614 --> 43:19.756
The choice of the dash through
the reeds was an escape

43:19.791 --> 43:22.759
but also an open
invitation to the pursuer

43:22.794 --> 43:27.937
because of the clear path
of broken reeds left behind.

43:27.971 --> 43:31.112
Was there an element
of come and catch me

43:31.147 --> 43:33.045
in you as a child?

43:33.080 --> 43:36.186
Or perhaps, more importantly

43:36.221 --> 43:38.326
in you as a person?

43:40.674 --> 43:43.918
Was there never a tiny grain
of disappointment

43:43.953 --> 43:47.094
about the great rain
that washed away

43:47.128 --> 43:50.028
your tracks so you
couldn't be caught?

43:50.062 --> 43:52.306
More like amazement..

43:52.340 --> 43:55.620
...when I think about all the
things I've done in my life

43:55.654 --> 43:59.037
without it, in any way,
resulting in punishment.

44:17.814 --> 44:20.092
I loved when the men
from the village

44:20.127 --> 44:22.405
cut the meadows
with their scythes.

44:29.446 --> 44:32.380
Back then one spoke
of the breath of the meadow.

44:33.865 --> 44:35.729
Everyone working in rhythm

44:35.763 --> 44:38.870
exhaling when they mowed,
and inhaling when they pulled

44:38.904 --> 44:40.250
the scythes back.

45:03.549 --> 45:06.345
It was as if the meadow
lived at its fullest

45:06.380 --> 45:08.106
in my consciousness..

45:08.140 --> 45:10.522
...when I listened
to its breath.

46:34.468 --> 46:37.126
Stop that.

46:39.749 --> 46:41.026
Stop it.

46:43.063 --> 46:44.858
Stop it!

46:47.653 --> 46:49.586
Stop it!

47:10.918 --> 47:14.991
Experience had taught me
how to strangle correctly

47:15.026 --> 47:16.890
and for long enough.

47:25.174 --> 47:27.038
Bravo, Jack!

47:27.072 --> 47:31.180
You certainly
are clever and tough..

47:31.214 --> 47:33.976
...just like
all the other criminals.

47:54.824 --> 47:58.793
The fact is, when,
after several more murders

47:58.828 --> 48:01.555
I felt my OCD diminish

48:01.589 --> 48:03.868
I started to take
greater chances.

49:13.627 --> 49:16.871
This time I was completely
dissatisfied with the pictures

49:16.906 --> 49:19.322
so I decided to take new ones.

49:55.565 --> 49:58.258
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck it!

50:22.903 --> 50:25.078
Shit!

50:25.112 --> 50:27.287
It struck me like lightning
from a clear sky.

50:27.321 --> 50:28.322
Fuck!

50:28.357 --> 50:29.530
I couldn't resist running

50:29.565 --> 50:31.015
that little old lady over.

50:32.499 --> 50:35.053
It made my already rather
daring plan of bringing

50:35.088 --> 50:37.366
the first body back
to the scene of the murder

50:37.400 --> 50:40.265
in order to take
some more inspired photos

50:40.300 --> 50:42.888
a great deal more dangerous.

50:42.923 --> 50:45.546
I now had a severely
hemorrhaging body

50:45.581 --> 50:50.068
and another body in a bizarre,
frozen position on my hands.

50:50.103 --> 50:51.656
Goddammit!

50:53.071 --> 51:00.009
♪ Fame fame fame fame ♪ Fame fame ♪

51:00.044 --> 51:02.218
Could you elaborate a little

51:02.253 --> 51:05.221
on why the old lady had to die?

51:05.256 --> 51:09.398
I can't explain it all,
but perhaps I can describe it

51:09.432 --> 51:11.262
as the kind of blood frenzy

51:11.296 --> 51:14.230
an ermine experiences
in a hen house.

51:15.921 --> 51:18.441
Do you know Blake's poems..

51:18.476 --> 51:20.616
...about the lamb
and the tiger?

51:21.755 --> 51:25.448
I do know Blake superficially

51:25.483 --> 51:30.074
but I'm afraid I won't escape
a comprehensive tutorial.

51:32.559 --> 51:35.079
God created both
the lamb and the tiger.

51:37.391 --> 51:39.393
The lamb represents innocence

51:39.428 --> 51:41.913
and the tiger represents
savagery.

51:41.947 --> 51:44.916
Both parts are perfect
and necessary.

51:44.950 --> 51:46.952
The tiger lives
on blood and murder

51:46.987 --> 51:48.920
kills the lamb..

51:48.954 --> 51:52.544
...and that is also
the artist's nature.

51:52.579 --> 51:56.617
You read Blake like
the devil reads the Bible.

51:56.652 --> 51:59.965
After all, the poor lamb
didn't ask to die

52:00.000 --> 52:04.246
in order to become even
the greatest art.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.731
The lamb has been bestowed
with the honor of living

52:06.765 --> 52:10.044
forever in art,
and art is divine.

52:14.152 --> 52:17.776
But still the same red van.
Now all bloody.

52:17.811 --> 52:19.606
Somewhat reckless,
I should think

52:19.640 --> 52:21.918
if you don't want
to be found out.

52:23.886 --> 52:27.234
Now, that's exactly
what I thought..

52:27.269 --> 52:29.857
...but I didn't have
the strength to change it

52:29.892 --> 52:32.998
and besides, everything was
still going remarkably well.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.866
Sometimes the best way
to hide is to not hide at all.

52:54.296 --> 53:00.094
But now, as I said,
the OCD was on decline..

53:00.129 --> 53:03.546
...so I took deliberate risks
and didn't remove the blood

53:03.581 --> 53:06.377
from either the bedroom
or the car.

53:06.411 --> 53:09.690
It was actually quite
liberating to reach that point.

53:13.763 --> 53:18.043
It turned out the little old
lady who was merely an accident

53:18.078 --> 53:22.220
added a great touch of humor
to my staged photographs.

53:22.255 --> 53:24.395
And I was very pleased
with the outcome.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.268
Sophistication.

53:36.648 --> 53:39.824
Mr. Sophistication? Of course!

53:39.858 --> 53:43.068
Your narcissism
knows no bounds.

53:50.283 --> 53:52.388
I sent the picture
to the local paper

53:52.423 --> 53:55.736
which usually distinguished
itself by running stories

53:55.771 --> 54:00.258
about missing, not to say,
uh, stolen garden gates

54:00.293 --> 54:03.744
and so, might do well
with a story with a, you know

54:03.779 --> 54:06.022
little more bite.

54:06.057 --> 54:08.922
For me though, what was really
sensational about the work

54:08.956 --> 54:11.511
with the photo,
it wasn't the image

54:11.545 --> 54:13.306
but the negative.

54:16.619 --> 54:18.828
When I was ten years old,
I discovered

54:18.863 --> 54:21.245
that through the negative,
you could see

54:21.279 --> 54:25.697
the real inner
demonic quality of the light.

54:25.732 --> 54:27.389
The dark light.

55:15.678 --> 55:19.510
But what about
repentance, Jack?

55:19.544 --> 55:23.376
The ones I deal with tend
to repent all over the place.

55:25.378 --> 55:27.311
I repent nothing

55:27.345 --> 55:29.934
no matter how long
we have to walk

55:29.968 --> 55:32.833
but I did think
of something the other day.

55:32.868 --> 55:36.147
Imagine a man
walking down a street

55:36.181 --> 55:38.667
underneath the street lamps.

55:38.701 --> 55:41.290
Right under a light
his shadow is the densest

55:41.325 --> 55:43.706
but also the tiniest.

55:43.741 --> 55:45.363
Then when he starts to move

55:45.398 --> 55:48.193
his shadow grows
in front of him.

55:48.228 --> 55:50.817
The shadow becomes
bigger and bigger

55:50.851 --> 55:54.027
while it thins out
and the shadow behind him

55:54.061 --> 55:56.581
from the next lamppost emerges

55:56.616 --> 55:59.481
and becomes
shorter and shorter

55:59.515 --> 56:01.931
until it reaches
its ultimate density

56:01.966 --> 56:05.728
as the man stands directly
underneath the light.

56:05.763 --> 56:07.420
Let's say that the man standing

56:07.454 --> 56:09.698
underneath the first lamppost
is me

56:09.732 --> 56:11.493
when I've just
committed a murder.

56:11.527 --> 56:14.599
I feel strong and content.

56:14.634 --> 56:18.914
I start to walk and the shadow
in front of me grows bigger

56:18.948 --> 56:21.882
like my pleasure,
but at the same time

56:21.917 --> 56:25.610
pain is on its way,
represented by the shadow

56:25.645 --> 56:28.302
behind me
from the next lamppost

56:28.337 --> 56:32.203
and at the midpoint
between the lampposts

56:32.237 --> 56:36.621
the pain is so great
it outweighs my pleasure.

56:36.656 --> 56:39.728
And with every step forward
pleasure dissolves

56:39.762 --> 56:42.524
and pain
intensifies behind me.

56:42.558 --> 56:46.631
Finally the pain
is so unbearably intense

56:46.666 --> 56:49.565
that I have to act,
so when I reach the point

56:49.600 --> 56:52.154
with the next lamp in zenith

56:52.188 --> 56:53.776
I will kill again.

56:55.502 --> 57:00.127
I know you want
to be someone special, Jack

57:00.162 --> 57:03.372
but let's face it,
this illustration can be used

57:03.407 --> 57:06.306
for any addict's tale of woe.

57:06.340 --> 57:09.067
The alcoholic empties
the bottle at the zenith

57:09.102 --> 57:10.690
et cetera, et cetera.

57:12.416 --> 57:14.348
But what about the family?

57:21.735 --> 57:24.600
I understand that your
occupation didn't leave

57:24.635 --> 57:27.500
any room for a family
in your life.

57:27.534 --> 57:30.261
No, why?

57:30.295 --> 57:33.195
Well, it could be,
despite everything

57:33.229 --> 57:36.232
that speculating about this
might have triggered

57:36.267 --> 57:39.166
just a tiny bit
of human feeling.

57:39.201 --> 57:44.586
For example, a variation on
what those of us less clever

57:44.620 --> 57:46.553
might call need.

57:46.588 --> 57:49.314
Need? Because
I never had a family?

57:49.349 --> 57:52.352
No, I can't say that it did.

57:52.386 --> 57:55.873
But the concept of family
actually inspired

57:55.907 --> 57:58.289
one of my greatest works.

58:23.797 --> 58:25.661
Okay, hats for everyone

58:25.696 --> 58:27.767
you are to keep
your hats on at all times.

58:27.801 --> 58:30.321
- Thank you.
- Safety procedures.

58:36.569 --> 58:38.122
Can we go up there, mom?

58:38.156 --> 58:40.193
Of course we're gonna go up.

58:40.227 --> 58:42.851
Smile, grumpy, it'll be fun.

58:42.885 --> 58:45.060
I don't think so.

58:45.094 --> 58:47.718
It's for your sake we've come
all the way out here.

58:47.752 --> 58:50.341
I told you I didn't wanna go.

58:50.375 --> 58:51.791
You wanna see the weapons?

58:54.069 --> 58:57.003
This, George, is a rifle.

58:57.037 --> 59:00.385
This rifle has the capacity
to hit its target

59:00.420 --> 59:03.630
at a distance
of several 100 yards.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.114
And kill larger animals.

59:07.496 --> 59:09.947
Have you killed
any large animals?

59:10.672 --> 59:12.846
Well, yes, I have.

59:12.881 --> 59:14.814
But that's not something
that I'm proud of.

59:14.848 --> 59:17.195
If I'd killed
some large animals

59:17.230 --> 59:18.576
I'd be proud of it.

59:18.611 --> 59:22.338
I guess that's where
you and I differ, Georgie.

59:22.373 --> 59:24.133
This here is a shotgun.

59:25.618 --> 59:28.275
It's what they call
a smoothbore weapon.

59:28.310 --> 59:30.795
This is not as precise
as the rifle

59:30.830 --> 59:32.797
but it's more effective

59:32.832 --> 59:34.868
when the animal is closer
and moving.

59:36.594 --> 59:38.147
You can touch it if you want.

59:38.182 --> 59:39.459
Can I?

59:41.012 --> 59:42.531
Yeah.

59:42.566 --> 59:44.740
Are we going hunting?

59:44.775 --> 59:45.775
No.

59:46.949 --> 59:49.055
Hunting is such
an unpleasant thing.

59:52.368 --> 59:55.130
I used to hunt quite a bit,
but I've stopped.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.132
Why?

59:57.166 --> 01:00:01.619
To be honest,
I find hunting distasteful.

01:00:01.654 --> 01:00:04.760
For example, if I wanted
to shoot some of the crows

01:00:04.795 --> 01:00:07.625
up in that tree,
we'd be talking about

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.353
what is known as culling,
which quite simply means

01:00:11.387 --> 01:00:15.288
you want to determine which
animals you are going to allow

01:00:15.322 --> 01:00:16.910
to live in your forest.

01:00:18.153 --> 01:00:20.396
The crow has no value as prey

01:00:20.431 --> 01:00:23.468
but can be culled because
they are seen as something

01:00:23.503 --> 01:00:27.438
of a threat to animals
you wanna cultivate.

01:00:28.819 --> 01:00:33.375
Culling, it's also such
an unpleasant word.

01:00:33.409 --> 01:00:37.482
It has a tinge of ethnic
cleansing about it.

01:00:37.517 --> 01:00:41.417
The very sick
and twisted act of hunting

01:00:41.452 --> 01:00:43.523
has been ritualized

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.802
to such an unsettling degree.

01:00:46.837 --> 01:00:49.529
The battue, for example

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.049
where a row of beaters
scares the living daylight

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:53.844
out of an entire forest.

01:00:56.294 --> 01:00:59.159
Not to mention the trophy
parade, practiced primarily

01:00:59.194 --> 01:01:01.541
in Europe
at the end of the hunt

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.612
as a final insult

01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:07.236
in which each species
has its own traditional place.

01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:09.480
We want to go up
in the tower, mom.

01:01:09.514 --> 01:01:10.895
Shh. George, wait.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:13.070
Yep, we are going up.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.944
Okay, George,
you want to shoot?

01:01:31.502 --> 01:01:34.160
I'll aim..

01:01:34.194 --> 01:01:35.609
...you pull the trigger.

01:01:38.958 --> 01:01:39.959
Fire!

01:01:42.651 --> 01:01:43.997
Excellent!

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:53.248
To fell an animal of this size

01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:55.319
you have to be sure
to hit it in the vitals

01:01:55.353 --> 01:01:58.115
which is to say here,
in the area of the lungs.

01:01:59.495 --> 01:02:02.084
As you can see,
this one was hit here

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:04.500
in the hind quarter.

01:02:04.535 --> 01:02:06.054
An animal could run
a great distance

01:02:06.088 --> 01:02:08.435
with an injury such as this.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.541
That's why typically
a good hunter would have

01:02:10.575 --> 01:02:15.304
a Schweiss-dog, that's trained
in following a blood trail

01:02:15.339 --> 01:02:18.238
so you can track the animal
down and finish the job.

01:02:20.413 --> 01:02:25.383
Schweiss, well, that's
the word we use for blood trail.

01:02:25.418 --> 01:02:29.353
Congratulations, young Georgie,
you hit the animal.

01:02:31.217 --> 01:02:35.393
So you had found yourself
a family?

01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:40.571
Yes, that's also how
I like to see it.

01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:47.371
But it's all so much
simpler with animals.

01:02:47.405 --> 01:02:49.580
What do you mean?

01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:52.134
The order is important.

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:55.724
The hind will typically run in
the front with the largest fawn

01:02:55.759 --> 01:02:58.071
following the smallest last.

01:02:58.106 --> 01:02:59.659
You'd typically shoot
at the deer

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:01.143
starting with the rear one

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:04.526
based on the fact that the two
older animals can survive

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.114
without the young one

01:03:06.148 --> 01:03:08.979
whereas, if you shot
the mother first

01:03:09.013 --> 01:03:10.912
and didn't get the others

01:03:10.946 --> 01:03:13.984
both fawns would probably
not survive.

01:03:14.018 --> 01:03:17.366
So in this manner,
you then shoot the bigger fawn

01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:19.403
and then the mother last.

01:03:23.614 --> 01:03:25.616
Stay down!

01:03:31.518 --> 01:03:33.693
Stop! George!

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.801
George!

01:03:37.835 --> 01:03:40.665
My family was moving
in the wrong order.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.634
I have always taken
ethical hunting rules

01:03:43.668 --> 01:03:45.843
very seriously.

01:03:45.878 --> 01:03:50.192
On that point,
I think of myself as a bit of a gentleman.

01:03:52.022 --> 01:03:53.817
A gentleman, really?

01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:55.163
Hmm.

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:57.924
Or a Mr. Sophistication even?

01:04:21.534 --> 01:04:25.987
No! No!

01:04:30.094 --> 01:04:31.094
No!

01:05:10.464 --> 01:05:12.915
George doesn't seem to have
much of an appetite.

01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.575
Perhaps he'd like
some of that pie.

01:05:25.065 --> 01:05:28.586
You know, when I was a boy,
I never got enough pie.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:32.348
Why don't you do as I say..

01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:36.421
...and give the youngster
a little piece of pie?

01:05:39.424 --> 01:05:41.909
It's if have no say
in the matter.

01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:51.333
This was supposed to be
an enjoyable picnic.

01:06:47.897 --> 01:06:49.899
This has been a good day.

01:06:53.282 --> 01:06:55.007
An excellent day.

01:06:58.494 --> 01:07:00.323
Do you have a favorite number?

01:07:02.877 --> 01:07:04.155
Any number?

01:07:06.053 --> 01:07:07.813
Everybody has
a favorite number.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.995
Twelve.

01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:18.238
Twelve.

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:22.518
That's an excellent number.

01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:27.937
Very good number indeed.

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:31.665
Picnic's over.

01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:35.979
You can go ahead.

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:40.191
I'll take care of the kids.

01:07:47.784 --> 01:07:49.165
One.

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.650
Two.

01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:57.998
Three.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.276
Four.

01:08:02.173 --> 01:08:04.071
Five.

01:08:05.106 --> 01:08:06.521
Six.

01:08:08.556 --> 01:08:09.833
Seven.

01:08:12.144 --> 01:08:13.318
Eight.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:16.941
Nine.

01:08:18.322 --> 01:08:19.944
Ten.

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:21.359
Eleven.

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:25.122
Twelve.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.705
Schweiss.

01:08:58.913 --> 01:09:00.502
Exactly.

01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:12.047
Do you expect me
to praise you or applaud?

01:11:12.082 --> 01:11:14.602
You know, I'm sad

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:17.018
that you're
so judgmental, Verge.

01:11:17.052 --> 01:11:20.918
Don't look at the acts,
look at the works.

01:11:20.953 --> 01:11:22.506
The whole notion of trophies.

01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:25.544
No. No, no, no!

01:11:25.578 --> 01:11:28.926
You're constantly
trying to manipulate me.

01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:30.825
And with children

01:11:30.859 --> 01:11:33.241
the most sensitive
subject of all.

01:11:34.553 --> 01:11:36.624
I'm also sensitive, Verge.

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:42.975
I cannot sleep on a sheet with
even the smallest wrinkle.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:50.085
The hunt, after all,
is a metaphor for love.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.674
And that is your weakness,
Jack.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:55.884
So much has happened
during those days

01:11:55.919 --> 01:11:58.577
let's call it signs
in the sun and the moon

01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:02.373
which claimed my presence
for yet another work of art

01:12:02.408 --> 01:12:04.617
and roused my aggression.

01:12:14.489 --> 01:12:16.111
First, the eclipse.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.946
Then the volcanic eruption
of Mount St. Helens

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.224
which I could see
from my lot.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:28.503
I had just then decided
that using cinder blocks

01:12:28.538 --> 01:12:31.230
was totally, totally wrong.

01:12:32.645 --> 01:12:34.647
So I decided
to change the material.

01:12:36.442 --> 01:12:37.961
The divine material.

01:12:39.687 --> 01:12:41.620
Love, Jack.

01:12:41.654 --> 01:12:44.174
Love is also an art.

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:46.072
Not to mention intimacy.

01:12:51.664 --> 01:12:54.805
The Iceman always inhaled
his victims' last breath.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.427
Jack!

01:12:56.462 --> 01:12:58.740

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.673

01:14:50.956 --> 01:14:52.336
Verge?

01:14:52.371 --> 01:14:54.062
I'm here, Jack.

01:15:05.073 --> 01:15:06.799
I don't feel so good, Verge.

01:15:11.079 --> 01:15:13.979
There's a sour taste
in my mouth.

01:15:14.013 --> 01:15:17.499
You want me to show you the
way to the next whiskey bar?

01:15:21.538 --> 01:15:24.437
It's the acid
you are starting to taste.

01:15:26.336 --> 01:15:28.407
It appears at this depth.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.344
I'm afraid you are going
to have to get used to it.

01:15:53.808 --> 01:15:56.811
I placed Grumpy
in the anteroom..

01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:01.056
...and left him there
until rigor mortis

01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:02.471
had disappeared.

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:07.131
I had a plan
for little Grumpy.

01:16:09.133 --> 01:16:10.687
What does that mean?

01:16:13.517 --> 01:16:17.348
Those who are really good
at taxidermy

01:16:17.383 --> 01:16:19.937
can make the animals
look alive

01:16:19.972 --> 01:16:22.940
by changing their expressions
and positions

01:16:24.286 --> 01:16:27.634
so it becomes
a whole little scene.

01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:43.604
I discovered that if I worked
around rigor mortis

01:16:43.638 --> 01:16:46.503
and worked before
the corpses froze

01:16:46.538 --> 01:16:50.266
then I could manipulate
their expressions

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.856
and positions with
steel wire, pins, tape

01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:55.927
and things like that.

01:16:55.961 --> 01:16:57.929
And then when they were frozen

01:16:57.963 --> 01:17:00.310
remove it all
and have a nearly

01:17:00.345 --> 01:17:02.243
credible human being.

01:17:03.278 --> 01:17:06.591
Grumpy was grumpy no more.

01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:09.687
Was that what you were after?

01:17:09.722 --> 01:17:12.897
A completely credible
human being?

01:17:12.932 --> 01:17:16.142
Without becoming too romantic,
might one say

01:17:16.177 --> 01:17:19.421
that exactly that
is reminiscent

01:17:19.456 --> 01:17:22.079
of a kind of desire
for love?

01:17:24.114 --> 01:17:26.840
I had a romance.

01:17:45.859 --> 01:17:48.862
Where did the crutch
come from, Jack?

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:52.176
You hadn't hurt yourself,
had you?

01:17:52.211 --> 01:17:55.904
A very useful little trick
if you wish to look harmless.

01:17:55.938 --> 01:18:00.115
In general, if you carry some
luggage and a crutch

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:02.738
people come running
to assist

01:18:02.773 --> 01:18:05.224
and then you force them
into the car with a weapon.

01:18:05.258 --> 01:18:07.881
What does that
have to do with love?

01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:13.404
I really had strong feelings
for this one

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:17.270
much stronger than a psychopath
should be able to have.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:28.247
Smile.

01:18:40.707 --> 01:18:41.984
Hey.

01:18:46.265 --> 01:18:47.749
Talk to me.

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:50.131
I can't.

01:18:51.339 --> 01:18:53.444
I hate the way you look at me.

01:18:59.588 --> 01:19:01.211
The way I look at you?

01:19:04.904 --> 01:19:06.319
Okay.

01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:46.428
Can you tell me
what's on your mind now?

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:55.126
I just don't know
where I've got you.

01:19:57.267 --> 01:19:59.924
Are you trying to leave me?

01:19:59.959 --> 01:20:01.995
I feel like you're trying
to leave me.

01:20:03.514 --> 01:20:05.206
I'm not going to leave you.

01:20:07.311 --> 01:20:08.588
I'm right here.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.322
You feel that?

01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:24.363
I'm right here,
on the other end of the line.

01:20:30.714 --> 01:20:32.163
Hang up for a second.

01:20:43.244 --> 01:20:45.867
- Hello.
- Who am I speaking with?

01:20:50.354 --> 01:20:52.356
You know who
you are speaking with.

01:20:55.773 --> 01:20:57.741
You know I'd never leave you.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.365
Now what do you say?

01:21:04.955 --> 01:21:06.957
Don't you think we deserve
a drink?

01:21:09.546 --> 01:21:11.341
Sure.

01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:12.997
I'll be over shortly
for cocktails.

when you call me Simple.

01:21:31.602 --> 01:21:34.191
My name is Jacqueline.

01:21:34.225 --> 01:21:35.468
Jacqueline?

01:21:37.194 --> 01:21:40.991
Did old Mr. and Mrs. Simple really
have that vivid an imagination?

01:21:43.062 --> 01:21:45.720
Jacqueline..
I bet they got that

01:21:45.754 --> 01:21:49.068
right out of "The New York Times"
crossword puzzle.

01:21:49.102 --> 01:21:52.071
To me, your name is
Simple, simple.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.284
Hey, you've got great tits.

01:21:59.458 --> 01:22:01.770
Why do you always
have to be so crude?

01:22:03.116 --> 01:22:05.843
What..

01:22:05.878 --> 01:22:07.914
Is that being crude?

01:22:07.949 --> 01:22:09.537
I don't think
I was being crude.

01:22:11.573 --> 01:22:13.334
Have you figured out
the difference between

01:22:13.368 --> 01:22:14.956
lions and tigers?

01:22:18.408 --> 01:22:20.168
Tigers have stripes.

01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:21.583
And where do they live?

01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:25.691
Africa?

01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:33.630
And the difference between
an architect and an engineer?

01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:38.566
Architect draws houses?

01:22:41.051 --> 01:22:42.673
And an engineer?

01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:50.094
Also draws houses?

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.477
You call that a difference?

01:22:55.065 --> 01:22:58.758
An engineer reads music,
an architect plays music

01:22:58.793 --> 01:23:02.797
if that's something your
limited brain can process.

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:08.803
Why do you always
have to be so cruel?

01:23:10.356 --> 01:23:12.703
I'm not completely stupid.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:15.879
That fucking depends on your
definition of "Completely."

01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:22.309
Can we just talk
about something normal?

01:23:22.333 --> 01:23:23.680
- Like..
- Like?

01:23:23.714 --> 01:23:25.302
What you do,
something like that?

01:23:25.336 --> 01:23:27.408
Information about what I do.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:32.620
In simple terms that
a simpleton can understand

01:23:32.654 --> 01:23:34.242
is that right, Simple?

01:23:35.968 --> 01:23:37.210
Yes.

01:23:42.008 --> 01:23:43.458
I kill.

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:47.428
Okay.

01:23:52.536 --> 01:23:55.297
I've killed 60 people.

01:23:57.645 --> 01:23:59.888
I'm a serial killer, Simple.

01:24:02.373 --> 01:24:04.617
You're weird.

01:24:04.652 --> 01:24:07.102
I'm weird?

01:24:07.137 --> 01:24:10.174
Why, because I'm saying that
I've killed 61 people?

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:13.592
You said 60 before.

01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:21.703
If you weren't as dumb
as a fucking doorknob

01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:24.430
you would be familiar
with the term "Updated."

01:24:26.846 --> 01:24:30.850
Just because the number
was 60 an hour ago

01:24:30.885 --> 01:24:33.991
doesn't mean that
it can't easily become

01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:36.511
61 in just
a couple of minutes.

01:24:36.546 --> 01:24:38.513
Well, I'm not dumb
as a doorknob.

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:42.241
Maybe I haven't
read as many books as you.

01:24:42.275 --> 01:24:44.692
Simple, come on.

01:24:44.726 --> 01:24:46.417
You're as dumb as fuck.

01:24:48.558 --> 01:24:50.156
Now why don't you be
a good little dreamboat

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.803
and go get me a magic marker.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:54.667
Could you bring me
a magic marker?

01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.464
Red or black?

01:24:59.534 --> 01:25:01.087
E... either one's fine.

01:26:44.743 --> 01:26:46.537
You're fucking weird.

01:27:02.519 --> 01:27:03.658
Excuse me.

01:27:03.693 --> 01:27:05.764
- Officer.
- Yeah.

01:27:05.798 --> 01:27:08.594
My friend is, like,
totally weird

01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:11.355
and he said he killed
60 people

01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:13.634
or maybe even 61.

01:27:13.668 --> 01:27:15.497
Have you been drinking?

01:27:15.532 --> 01:27:18.673
Um, yeah.

01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:19.985
Then stop.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.610
Everything that this woman
has said..

01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:27.164
...is true.

01:27:30.271 --> 01:27:32.514
I have killed 60 people!

01:27:33.688 --> 01:27:36.208
Sixty people!

01:27:36.242 --> 01:27:37.692
I'm a serial killer.

01:27:37.727 --> 01:27:40.591
Please help me.

01:27:40.626 --> 01:27:43.802
I've also been
a horrible human being..

01:27:45.838 --> 01:27:47.564
...to this woman right here..

01:27:51.223 --> 01:27:53.018
...Ms. Jacqueline.

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:01.371
Miss, would you be kind enough
to sweep up your friend here

01:28:01.405 --> 01:28:03.166
and take him back inside?

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.064
I can't order you both
to stop drinking

01:28:05.099 --> 01:28:06.687
but I would recommend it.

01:28:41.342 --> 01:28:43.068
I can never make it up to you.

01:28:45.139 --> 01:28:47.210
Never be able
to make it up to you.

01:29:02.432 --> 01:29:03.709
Can you forgive me?

01:29:06.263 --> 01:29:07.471
Yeah.

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:13.029
I forgive you.

01:29:19.035 --> 01:29:22.141
Come on.
Let's go inside.

01:29:27.837 --> 01:29:30.149
You need some pills.

01:29:30.184 --> 01:29:32.324
I've got a friend
who's got some good pills.

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.876
Are you leaving?

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:23.400
I was just gonna go
get some pills.

01:31:31.581 --> 01:31:34.549
Do you have my... my keys?

01:31:34.584 --> 01:31:37.104
I'm not gonna take
some random pills.

01:31:41.453 --> 01:31:44.766
You know, I really think
I deserve better than this.

01:31:48.632 --> 01:31:50.565
I'm gonna hang on to the keys.

01:31:53.568 --> 01:31:56.019
It's a bad habit for you to

01:31:56.054 --> 01:31:58.573
go rushing downstairs
every time

01:31:58.608 --> 01:32:00.748
we start to have,
have a good time.

01:32:02.508 --> 01:32:03.751
Right?

01:32:06.823 --> 01:32:09.515
You're walking
without your crutch.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.592
And you weren't
using it downstairs either.

01:32:34.057 --> 01:32:37.267
You're Mr. Sophistication,
aren't you?

01:32:42.272 --> 01:32:44.067
If you feel like screaming..

01:32:45.655 --> 01:32:47.657
...I definitely think
that you should.

01:33:06.607 --> 01:33:08.436
You call that screaming?

01:33:09.679 --> 01:33:12.199
Help! Help!

01:33:14.304 --> 01:33:15.926
Help!

01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:18.032
Yes, help!

01:33:18.067 --> 01:33:20.621
There's a murderer
in the building!

01:33:20.655 --> 01:33:22.588
It's Mr. Sophistication!

01:33:22.623 --> 01:33:25.074
Help!

01:33:25.108 --> 01:33:27.076
Help!

01:33:29.112 --> 01:33:30.458
Shh!

01:33:32.150 --> 01:33:34.462
Shh! Hey.

01:33:34.497 --> 01:33:35.636
Hey. Hey.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.501
Shh!

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:52.204
Do you hear?

01:33:52.239 --> 01:33:54.724
Do you hear anything?

01:33:54.758 --> 01:33:57.382
Do you hear anybody
running downstairs to help?

01:34:02.145 --> 01:34:04.734
Some neighbors you have.

01:34:04.768 --> 01:34:06.701
You want to try the window?

01:34:06.736 --> 01:34:08.979
I just want my keys.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.605
I just want my keys.

01:34:13.639 --> 01:34:15.227
I want my keys.

01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:18.886
Help!

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.371
Help!

01:34:22.752 --> 01:34:25.444
Help me!

01:34:26.825 --> 01:34:29.207
Please help me!

01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:47.777
You know, maybe I'm mistaken,
but..

01:34:47.811 --> 01:34:49.399
...as far as I can tell..

01:34:51.367 --> 01:34:54.680
...not a single light
has gone on

01:34:54.715 --> 01:34:57.545
in any apartment or stairwell.

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.891
You know why that is?

01:35:00.307 --> 01:35:03.689
'Cause in this hell of a town..

01:35:05.519 --> 01:35:07.245
...in this hell of a country..

01:35:09.316 --> 01:35:14.183
...in this hell of a world,
nobody wants to help!

01:35:19.498 --> 01:35:22.260
You can scream..

01:35:22.294 --> 01:35:25.573
...from now until Christmas Eve

01:35:25.608 --> 01:35:28.783
and the only answer
you'll get

01:35:28.818 --> 01:35:31.648
is the deafening silence
that you're hearing right now.

01:35:46.318 --> 01:35:48.044
Can't we talk?

01:35:49.908 --> 01:35:52.566
There's a time for talking

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.465
and a time for being quiet.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.709
Open your mouth.

01:35:57.743 --> 01:35:59.400
Open your mouth!

01:36:33.503 --> 01:36:34.987
Okay, Simple.

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:38.232
Oh, I'm sorry,
Ms. Jacqueline.

01:36:38.267 --> 01:36:41.649
Now, it's time..

01:36:43.133 --> 01:36:44.963
...for you to choose a knife.

01:36:46.171 --> 01:36:48.035
All you have to do is nod.

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:52.419
No?

01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.423
What about this one?

01:36:57.769 --> 01:36:59.564
You don't like
that one either?

01:36:59.598 --> 01:37:00.772
Okay.

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:04.189
How about this one?

01:37:07.019 --> 01:37:08.228
Hmm.

01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:11.610
Well..

01:37:13.957 --> 01:37:16.028
...that's an interesting
choice, Simple.

01:37:27.523 --> 01:37:29.110
You know..

01:37:30.905 --> 01:37:34.875
...there is something that has been
bothering Mr. Sophistication..

01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:39.604
...for quite a bit.

01:37:39.638 --> 01:37:42.365
And perhaps it's more
interesting to him..

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.886
...than it would be to you.

01:37:48.233 --> 01:37:50.753
But to be honest

01:37:50.787 --> 01:37:53.963
he gets pretty fuckin' pissed
when he thinks about it.

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:58.174
Why is it always
the man's fault?

01:38:00.970 --> 01:38:04.249
No matter where you go

01:38:04.284 --> 01:38:08.288
it's like you're some sort of
wandering guilty person.

01:38:11.463 --> 01:38:15.778
Without even having harmed
a single kitten.

01:38:19.368 --> 01:38:21.922
I actually get sad
when I think about it.

01:38:27.617 --> 01:38:30.965
If one is so unfortunate..

01:38:32.898 --> 01:38:36.419
...as to have been born male..

01:38:38.007 --> 01:38:40.320
...then you're also born guilty.

01:38:42.494 --> 01:38:44.876
Think of the injustice in that.

01:38:47.361 --> 01:38:49.777
Women are always
the victims, right?

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:57.337
And men, they are always
the criminals.

01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:24.568
Told you before,
this is private property.

01:39:27.364 --> 01:39:28.779
I want you to leave.

01:39:33.128 --> 01:39:36.580
All the king's horses
and all the king's men

01:39:36.614 --> 01:39:39.617
couldn't put Simple
back together again.

01:39:41.964 --> 01:39:44.242
Why are they always so stupid?

01:39:45.278 --> 01:39:47.073
Who's stupid?

01:39:47.107 --> 01:39:52.078
All the women you kill strike
me as seriously unintelligent.

01:39:52.112 --> 01:39:53.493
Come on.

01:39:53.528 --> 01:39:55.322
I've also killed men.

01:39:55.357 --> 01:39:58.567
But you only talk
about the stupid women

01:39:58.602 --> 01:40:02.537
unless you think
all women are stupid.

01:40:02.571 --> 01:40:05.816
Well, the stories I've told
were selected at random, but...

01:40:05.850 --> 01:40:09.958
You feel superior to women
and want to brag?

01:40:09.992 --> 01:40:12.823
It turns you on,
doesn't it, Jack?

01:40:12.857 --> 01:40:15.342
No, no,
but women are easier.

01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:18.725
Not physically, they're
just easier to work with.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.071
More cooperative.

01:40:20.106 --> 01:40:21.901
To kill, you mean.

01:40:21.935 --> 01:40:23.661
If you like.

01:40:24.696 --> 01:40:27.319
Mr. Sophistication believes
in that theory.

01:40:27.353 --> 01:40:32.186
So, Mr. Sophistication
is, uh, the theoretician?

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.567
I can tell
you're lapping it up

01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:36.224
when I tell you about
Mr. Sophistication.

01:40:36.259 --> 01:40:38.468
"So Jack hears voices

01:40:38.503 --> 01:40:41.229
"that order him
to do this or do that.

01:40:41.264 --> 01:40:43.369
Jack must be psychotic."

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:46.407
I loathe diagnosis you can
just write down in letters.

01:40:48.202 --> 01:40:52.068
That's not fair,
the letters are clear.

01:40:52.102 --> 01:40:54.898
They look after us
and create boundaries

01:40:54.933 --> 01:40:58.592
between good and evil,
and they carry religion.

01:40:58.626 --> 01:41:01.387
Religion has ruined
human beings

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:05.184
because your God teaches people
to deny the tiger in themselves

01:41:05.219 --> 01:41:08.325
and turns us all
into a throng of slaves

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.466
too shameful to acknowledge it.

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.675
Oh, Jack, you should have read

01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:15.263
the right letters in your life

01:41:15.298 --> 01:41:17.852
but you didn't want to.

01:41:17.887 --> 01:41:22.754
♪ Fame fame what you like
is in the limo ♪

01:41:22.788 --> 01:41:27.275
♪ Fame fame what you get
is no tomorrow ♪

01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:30.106
The collection of corpses were
mostly frozen

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.556
shortly after death

01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:34.420
however, I think a handful
of them, by chance

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:38.942
had reached, uh, at least, a
certain degree of putrefaction

01:41:38.977 --> 01:41:41.497
before I managed
to get them on ice.

01:41:41.531 --> 01:41:45.397
Can you say if putrefaction
is good or evil?

01:41:45.431 --> 01:41:48.573
Most people would say,
it's the natural breakdown

01:41:48.607 --> 01:41:51.196
which, in the end,
is a reaction of matter

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:53.923
which is the basis for life
on earth.

01:41:53.957 --> 01:41:56.753
Thereby, it's neither
particularly good nor evil

01:41:56.788 --> 01:41:59.687
and that a human being must be
perceived as alive

01:41:59.722 --> 01:42:02.518
if you're to describe
that person's qualities

01:42:02.552 --> 01:42:05.693
and identify that person's
ultimate goal.

01:42:05.728 --> 01:42:08.351
But this is where
Mr. Sophistication

01:42:08.385 --> 01:42:11.319
has a very different opinion.

01:42:11.354 --> 01:42:14.081
He argues quite well
that the ultimate goal

01:42:14.115 --> 01:42:17.153
for the human being
is not prior to death

01:42:17.187 --> 01:42:18.706
but after.

01:42:18.741 --> 01:42:22.089
You reduce everything human
to matter

01:42:22.123 --> 01:42:25.748
and that way life disappears
and along with it art

01:42:25.782 --> 01:42:28.198
which you value so highly.

01:42:28.233 --> 01:42:32.168
Verge, you're a bitter
old bastard.

01:42:32.202 --> 01:42:36.413
You kill art by imposing
your moral ruler on life

01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:37.967
which I want to free

01:42:38.001 --> 01:42:40.625
because art is so immeasurably
vaster

01:42:40.659 --> 01:42:42.316
than we will ever understand.

01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:44.111
May I illustrate now?

01:42:44.145 --> 01:42:47.666
There is no avoiding it,
is there?

01:42:52.119 --> 01:42:55.467
I don't have a handle on
how many processes take part

01:42:55.501 --> 01:42:58.332
in the decay of a dead human

01:42:58.366 --> 01:43:00.714
but I know a bit
about dessert wines.

01:43:02.370 --> 01:43:05.166
In order to achieve
the most sublime sweetness

01:43:05.201 --> 01:43:07.686
and the greatest wines,
nature has provided us

01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:09.067
with various methods.

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:14.106
The three most common forms
of decomposition are

01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:16.039
frost..

01:43:16.074 --> 01:43:18.007
...dehydration..

01:43:18.041 --> 01:43:19.698
...and a fungus
with the enticingly

01:43:19.733 --> 01:43:22.494
mysterious name,
the noble rot.

01:43:29.639 --> 01:43:32.297
The first method is the one
that in Germany

01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:34.886
is used to produce "Eiswein."

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.957
The method
quite simply entails

01:43:36.991 --> 01:43:39.304
leaving the grapes on the vine
for so long

01:43:39.338 --> 01:43:43.066
that they are exposed to frost
for a certain number of nights

01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:44.550
before they are pressed.

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:47.243
This method increases
the sugar content

01:43:47.277 --> 01:43:49.625
in the wine dramatically.

01:43:49.659 --> 01:43:53.490
It is very risky,
as the grapes must have certain qualities

01:43:53.525 --> 01:43:56.562
in order to be able to
withstand the process.

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:58.668
On top of that,
there can be uncertainty

01:43:58.703 --> 01:44:01.015
about whether or not the first
night's frost

01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:05.606
lives up precisely to the
expectations, et cetera.

01:44:05.641 --> 01:44:08.920
The second method
is called "Trockenbeeren"

01:44:08.954 --> 01:44:11.508
in which the grapes are
allowed to hang on the vine

01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:15.961
until they dry up and very
nearly become raisins.

01:44:15.996 --> 01:44:18.308
The last method,
which, for example

01:44:18.343 --> 01:44:21.415
is essential for the
production of Sauternes

01:44:21.449 --> 01:44:23.659
is a kind of mold
that causes grapes

01:44:23.693 --> 01:44:25.764
to be very full-bodied

01:44:25.799 --> 01:44:30.044
and have an explosively high
sugar content.

01:44:30.079 --> 01:44:32.460
You could say about
all three processes

01:44:32.495 --> 01:44:34.600
that it's the breakdown
that lifts the living grape

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:36.361
up to be a part of an artwork.

01:44:37.914 --> 01:44:40.952
You can view the processes
that start in a human being

01:44:40.986 --> 01:44:43.195
after death in the same manner.

01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:48.269
Says you! And I still say that
without love there is no art.

01:44:48.304 --> 01:44:51.031
It's not up for debate.

01:44:51.065 --> 01:44:53.723
The thing you are talking
about with the grapes

01:44:53.758 --> 01:44:57.278
is just nature's
method of decomposing.

01:44:57.313 --> 01:45:01.731
If decomposition
is a way to salvation

01:45:01.766 --> 01:45:03.975
then what about your house?

01:45:05.148 --> 01:45:07.530
By God, you cannot convince me

01:45:07.564 --> 01:45:10.636
that the idea of your first
house being torn down

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:13.018
was, in any way, satisfying.

01:45:13.053 --> 01:45:16.815
Do you claim that
it was built to be torn down?

01:45:18.127 --> 01:45:20.716
No, of course it wasn't ideal

01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:22.476
and I'm sorry to say
that it happened

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:24.581
no less than three more times

01:45:24.616 --> 01:45:28.137
that I started construction
and then became doubtful.

01:45:28.171 --> 01:45:30.346
It was difficult to create
the house

01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:31.865
that I had dreamed of.

01:45:31.899 --> 01:45:34.868
The material didn't do
what I wanted it to do.

01:45:34.902 --> 01:45:37.456
The houses I had drawn
had already

01:45:37.491 --> 01:45:39.907
at the very first detail,
something banal

01:45:39.942 --> 01:45:41.944
not to say ordinary,
about them

01:45:41.978 --> 01:45:46.465
Isn't that what in art
you would call epigonism?

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:49.606
Your great talent
only reached so far

01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:52.161
you, artist of all times.

01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:56.372
When you were writing,
didn't you yourself plan

01:45:56.406 --> 01:45:59.064
the destruction of your most
popular literary work?

01:46:00.307 --> 01:46:02.792
"The Aeneid"
was a commissioned work

01:46:02.827 --> 01:46:07.176
where the ruling power and
its ideas were glorified by me

01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:11.111
to the point
where it was no longer art.

01:46:11.145 --> 01:46:14.252
But if glorification
could demean a work..

01:46:15.943 --> 01:46:17.980
...why should destruction
and demolition

01:46:18.014 --> 01:46:21.397
not be able to do the opposite
and create art?

01:46:23.364 --> 01:46:26.574
Albert Speer invented
"The Theory of Ruin Value"

01:46:26.609 --> 01:46:29.336
by examining the Greek
and Roman ruins

01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:32.822
and constructed his buildings
using both weaker

01:46:32.857 --> 01:46:34.479
and stronger materials

01:46:34.513 --> 01:46:37.309
so that they, in a thousand
years, would appear

01:46:37.344 --> 01:46:39.277
as aesthetically perfect ruins.

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:43.384
Which fortunately
were smashed to atoms

01:46:43.419 --> 01:46:47.733
in mere few years
after their construction.

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:51.185
Hubris is punished by nemesis

01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:54.257
if I may use an old-fashioned
expression.

01:46:54.292 --> 01:46:56.225
But an artist must be cynical

01:46:56.259 --> 01:47:00.470
and not worry about the welfare
of humans or Gods in his art.

01:47:00.505 --> 01:47:02.714
This talk about
the value of ruins

01:47:02.748 --> 01:47:06.614
makes it too obvious, not to
mention, another subject.

01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:08.133
The value of icons.

01:47:26.255 --> 01:47:27.843
The Stuka

01:47:27.877 --> 01:47:30.776
without a doubt the world's
most beautiful airplane

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:35.057
and to top it off featuring an
eerily sophisticated detail.

01:47:35.091 --> 01:47:37.783
I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about.

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:41.546
No, by God
that has never interested me

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:43.824
but do tell me about it.

01:47:43.859 --> 01:47:45.688
The Stuka was a dive-bomber.

01:47:45.722 --> 01:47:47.932
They say that the pilots
actually passed out

01:47:47.966 --> 01:47:50.313
for a brief moment
during the actual dive.

01:47:50.348 --> 01:47:53.282
But the detail per favore.

01:47:53.316 --> 01:47:54.939
Fantastic.

01:47:54.973 --> 01:47:56.354
Incomparable.

01:47:56.388 --> 01:47:59.081
Notice the sound
when the plane dives.

01:47:59.115 --> 01:48:01.531
The screeching sound.

01:48:01.566 --> 01:48:05.397
A result of poor design
if you ask me.

01:48:05.432 --> 01:48:08.331
Poor design, please.

01:48:08.366 --> 01:48:12.370
On the contrary,
the screeching was intrinsic

01:48:12.404 --> 01:48:15.821
sirens were attached to
the undercarriage of the plane

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:20.792
purposely designed as a
psychological act of war.

01:48:20.826 --> 01:48:24.969
No one who heard it in action
will ever forget that sound.

01:48:25.003 --> 01:48:27.903
It made the blood run cold
in everyone's veins.

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.906
Known as Jericho's Trumpet.

01:48:32.977 --> 01:48:35.772
Sadistic, but in your eyes

01:48:35.807 --> 01:48:38.189
probably a masterpiece.

01:48:38.223 --> 01:48:42.020
No, more than a masterpiece.

01:48:42.676 --> 01:48:44.678
An icon.

01:48:44.712 --> 01:48:47.543
The person or persons,
who conceived the Stuka

01:48:47.577 --> 01:48:51.029
and its functions,
were icon-creators.

01:48:51.064 --> 01:48:52.893
What I'm getting at is this

01:48:52.928 --> 01:48:54.653
as disinclined
as the world is

01:48:54.688 --> 01:48:57.656
to acknowledge
the beauty of decay

01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:01.039
it's just as disinclined
to give credit to those

01:49:01.074 --> 01:49:03.593
no credit to us

01:49:03.628 --> 01:49:06.217
who create the real icons
of this planet.

01:49:07.701 --> 01:49:09.289
We are deemed
the ultimate evil.

01:49:13.638 --> 01:49:17.849
All the icons that have had
and always will have

01:49:17.883 --> 01:49:19.540
an impact on the world

01:49:19.575 --> 01:49:22.198
are for me extravagant art.

01:49:34.486 --> 01:49:36.143
The noble rot.

01:49:36.178 --> 01:49:40.458
Stop it... you Antichrist!

01:49:40.492 --> 01:49:42.978
I don't recall ever having
escorted

01:49:43.012 --> 01:49:47.016
a so thoroughly depraved
person as you, Jack.

01:49:50.485 --> 01:49:53.695
Since you have now apparently
set your heart

01:49:53.729 --> 01:49:56.145
in mass extermination

01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.493
let me make a brief comment

01:49:58.527 --> 01:50:01.047
about the Buchenwald camp

01:50:01.081 --> 01:50:06.293
that emphasizes my attitude
towards art and love.

01:50:06.328 --> 01:50:10.574
In the middle of this
concentration camp stood a tree

01:50:10.608 --> 01:50:13.335
and not just any old tree,
but an oak

01:50:13.369 --> 01:50:16.994
and not just any oak,
but the one Goethe

01:50:17.028 --> 01:50:18.685
when he was young,
sat beneath

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:23.448
and wrote some of humanity's
most important works.

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:24.726
Goethe.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.383
Here you can talk about
masterpieces

01:50:27.418 --> 01:50:30.076
and the value of icons.

01:50:30.110 --> 01:50:33.838
The personification
of humanism, dignity

01:50:33.873 --> 01:50:38.636
culture and goodness
was by the irony of faith

01:50:38.671 --> 01:50:40.742
suddenly present

01:50:40.776 --> 01:50:43.399
in the middle of one
of the all time

01:50:43.434 --> 01:50:46.368
greatest crimes
against humanity.

01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:50.993
Some people claim
that the atrocities we commit

01:50:51.028 --> 01:50:53.686
in our fiction
are those inner desires

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.828
which we cannot commit in our
controlled civilization.

01:50:57.862 --> 01:51:01.176
So they are expressed instead
through our art.

01:51:01.210 --> 01:51:03.143
I don't agree.

01:51:03.178 --> 01:51:06.422
I believe heaven and hell
are one and the same.

01:51:06.457 --> 01:51:10.703
The soul belongs to heaven
and the body to hell.

01:51:10.737 --> 01:51:15.397
The soul is reason and the body
is all the dangerous things

01:51:15.431 --> 01:51:18.227
for example art and icons.

01:51:22.369 --> 01:51:24.302
Let me finish
with a curiosity.

01:51:26.373 --> 01:51:28.030
I've always considered it
ridiculous

01:51:28.065 --> 01:51:29.894
when I've heard about the
serial killer's

01:51:29.929 --> 01:51:31.758
favorite trophy.

01:51:31.793 --> 01:51:33.277
Here you are, Jack.

01:51:34.761 --> 01:51:38.040
And yet I let myself be
tempted to not let

01:51:38.075 --> 01:51:40.146
Simple's other breast
go to waste

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.873
but have it prepared and sown.

01:51:42.907 --> 01:51:44.944
Also a small icon.

01:51:46.152 --> 01:51:47.463
Thank you, sir.

01:52:14.939 --> 01:52:16.838
Do you wanna fucking die?

01:52:18.909 --> 01:52:21.774
- No.
- Then do what I fucking say.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.433
Do what I say!

01:52:28.953 --> 01:52:30.334
Unlock it.

01:52:32.232 --> 01:52:33.578
Drop the keys.

01:52:34.856 --> 01:52:36.374
Turn around.

01:52:38.756 --> 01:52:39.756
Cuff.

01:52:40.862 --> 01:52:41.863
Cuff!

01:53:18.934 --> 01:53:20.073
Kneel down.

01:53:24.215 --> 01:53:26.355
We're freezing.

01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:28.288
One of the others
fainted earlier.

01:53:29.773 --> 01:53:31.153
We're dying of cold.

01:53:32.258 --> 01:53:33.708
We're dying.

01:53:37.504 --> 01:53:39.472
Really? "We're freezing."

01:53:41.405 --> 01:53:43.959
I guess I owe you gentlemen
an explanation.

01:53:47.722 --> 01:53:50.000
During World War II
on the eastern front

01:53:50.034 --> 01:53:54.383
German soldiers had large
programs of executions

01:53:54.418 --> 01:53:56.903
but were in short supply
of ammunition

01:53:56.938 --> 01:54:01.874
so they experimented with the
execution of several individuals

01:54:01.908 --> 01:54:05.015
with one,
just one single bullet.

01:54:05.049 --> 01:54:07.914
Now as a tribute
to that, uh, ingenuity..

01:54:09.882 --> 01:54:13.402
...I'm going to conduct a small
experiment of my own.

01:54:14.541 --> 01:54:16.302
I'm going to use..

01:54:19.029 --> 01:54:21.479
...a full metal jacket bullet

01:54:21.514 --> 01:54:23.309
which has the capacity

01:54:23.343 --> 01:54:26.519
to pass through each and every
one of your heads.

01:54:26.553 --> 01:54:29.004
That's not something
that I would be able to do

01:54:29.039 --> 01:54:30.972
with basic hunting ammunition.

01:54:33.043 --> 01:54:35.286
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, sir, sir.

01:54:35.321 --> 01:54:37.392
I... it's a
misunderstanding, sir.

01:54:37.426 --> 01:54:38.842
- I hear that a lot.
- No, sir.

01:54:38.876 --> 01:54:40.129
W... what I mean is
that you are wrong

01:54:40.153 --> 01:54:42.535
about the ammunition, sir.

01:54:42.569 --> 01:54:45.710
That is not full metal
ammunition, sir.

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:48.058
I'm a military man,
and I know, sir.

01:54:52.407 --> 01:54:53.477
Fuck.

01:54:54.823 --> 01:54:58.137
You're right!
This is a hunting round.

01:55:02.451 --> 01:55:05.040
This box, it's... it's
completely mislabeled.

01:55:05.075 --> 01:55:06.524
Goddammit!

01:55:08.906 --> 01:55:11.667
Forgive me, gentlemen,
I'm gonna have to, uh

01:55:11.702 --> 01:55:12.876
step out for a moment.

01:55:14.636 --> 01:55:18.605
I know it's not
an ideal situation.

01:55:20.159 --> 01:55:22.057
Don't die on me guys, okay?

01:55:54.779 --> 01:55:57.230
I've never yelled
at you before, Al

01:55:57.265 --> 01:55:59.405
but I'm about to now.

01:55:59.439 --> 01:56:01.856
What does that look like to you,
what does that say there?

01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:05.066
Uh, thirty odd six..

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.378
- Thirty odd six, that's correct.
- Yeah.

01:56:07.413 --> 01:56:09.691
It also says full metal jacket.

01:56:11.451 --> 01:56:13.143
And when I look inside..

01:56:15.628 --> 01:56:17.837
Get me a goddamn box, Al,
and this time

01:56:17.872 --> 01:56:21.910
make sure it's got full metal
jacket bullets in it!

01:56:21.945 --> 01:56:25.880
Is it too much to fucking ask
that the contents of the box

01:56:25.914 --> 01:56:28.744
match what's written
on the label?

01:56:28.779 --> 01:56:31.920
I can, I can see
that the, you're right

01:56:31.955 --> 01:56:34.889
the label doesn't
quite match the..

01:56:36.338 --> 01:56:37.546
...uh, content.

01:56:37.581 --> 01:56:39.963
- W... well, that's correct.
- Yeah, but..

01:56:39.997 --> 01:56:42.344
The thing is that
what I can't see

01:56:42.379 --> 01:56:45.692
is that the... the..

01:56:45.727 --> 01:56:50.387
...the box was bought here
in the shop.

01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:51.664
Uh..

01:56:51.698 --> 01:56:54.598
Well I buy all my shit here.

01:56:54.632 --> 01:56:56.738
I have, for 20 years.

01:56:56.772 --> 01:57:01.294
I'm in here
almost every other week.

01:57:01.329 --> 01:57:02.744
What's wrong with you, Al?

01:57:04.125 --> 01:57:05.885
I'm sorry,
I need to see a receipt.

01:57:06.817 --> 01:57:08.336
- Receipt?
- Yeah

01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:10.027
Well, I don't have a fuckin'
receipt.

01:57:10.062 --> 01:57:12.340
I don't ever recall getting a
receipt here.

01:57:12.374 --> 01:57:14.100
Now I'm in a fucking hurry.

01:57:14.135 --> 01:57:16.551
Let me buy a new box.

01:57:16.585 --> 01:57:17.966
But this time make sure
it contains

01:57:18.001 --> 01:57:19.519
full metal jacket bullets.

01:57:22.074 --> 01:57:26.216
Okay, uh, c... can I just see
some ID first?

01:57:27.596 --> 01:57:28.943
Don't fucking do this, Al.

01:57:28.977 --> 01:57:32.947
The thing is, the... the law
requires that I have...

01:57:32.981 --> 01:57:34.155
How about this..

01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:36.053
No doubt about
your... your identity...

01:57:36.088 --> 01:57:38.262
Sell me just one full metal
jacket bullet.

01:57:38.297 --> 01:57:40.747
Can I, can I just ask..

01:57:43.026 --> 01:57:45.338
...why just... one?

01:57:45.373 --> 01:57:47.375
Well, that will be none of your
fuckin' business.

01:57:47.409 --> 01:57:49.204
- That... that's right. I'm sor...
- Okay?

01:57:49.239 --> 01:57:52.069
I do business here because you
don't ask stupid questions.

01:57:52.104 --> 01:57:56.280
I'm... I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:57:56.315 --> 01:57:59.594
- Shut it down, Al, go home, have a sandwich.
- Okay.

01:57:59.628 --> 01:58:00.948
You've lost
your fucking mind, Al.

01:58:00.975 --> 01:58:02.838
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm so..

I need a full metal jacket
cartridge.

01:59:00.034 --> 01:59:04.831
Yesterday,
the police visited Al

01:59:04.866 --> 01:59:07.006
and then me

01:59:07.041 --> 01:59:09.422
with lights and sirens

01:59:09.457 --> 01:59:10.596
to get you.

01:59:12.046 --> 01:59:13.978
It's over now, Jack.

01:59:16.705 --> 01:59:17.982
What's over?

01:59:19.363 --> 01:59:21.296
They know what you've done.

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:26.888
We..

01:59:26.922 --> 01:59:28.959
Alright, what have I done?

01:59:29.753 --> 01:59:31.099
The robbery.

01:59:32.687 --> 01:59:34.033
Robbery?

01:59:34.068 --> 01:59:36.691
You guys better
fucking get it together.

01:59:36.725 --> 01:59:39.383
I haven't robbed anybody.

01:59:39.418 --> 01:59:41.109
This is ridiculous.

01:59:43.353 --> 01:59:46.080
I'm gonna call the police, Jack.

01:59:47.874 --> 01:59:49.497
Give me your gun.

01:59:51.292 --> 01:59:53.915
I don't run around
with guns on me.

01:59:53.949 --> 01:59:56.573
This is, this is crazy.

01:59:56.607 --> 01:59:58.402
Sit yourself down, Jack.

02:00:11.898 --> 02:00:13.590
This is S.P.

02:00:15.454 --> 02:00:17.111
I wanna get ahold of Rob.

02:00:22.944 --> 02:00:24.877
Well, when you get hold of him,
you'll tell him

02:00:24.911 --> 02:00:26.879
to get over here straight away.

02:00:28.777 --> 02:00:30.572
I've caught Jack.

02:00:38.891 --> 02:00:41.135
I'm kind of glad that you are
the one that caught me.

02:00:45.553 --> 02:00:47.382
Perhaps you don't know this..

02:00:49.591 --> 02:00:51.973
...but I think of you
as my best friend.

02:00:55.942 --> 02:00:58.290
Now that might not be
a big deal to you..

02:01:00.154 --> 02:01:03.467
...but you've meant
a great deal to me.

02:01:07.506 --> 02:01:10.612
It feels quite nice
knowing that it's all over.

02:01:17.688 --> 02:01:20.208
Somebody had to free me

02:01:20.243 --> 02:01:24.661
and stop me from stealing things
that don't belong to me.

02:01:26.421 --> 02:01:29.424
And that someone
turned out to be you.

02:01:31.185 --> 02:01:35.430
Do you remember the time you
took down that eight pointer

02:01:35.465 --> 02:01:37.501
that I'd been tracking
for four days?

02:01:40.608 --> 02:01:43.611
It was on my territory
for sure.

02:01:43.645 --> 02:01:45.854
No one's questioning that.

02:01:45.889 --> 02:01:47.615
You've always been
a great shot.

02:01:49.272 --> 02:01:52.861
Now would you, uh,
quit pointing that gun at me?

02:01:54.277 --> 02:01:56.244
Kind of hurting my feelings
a little bit.

02:01:58.591 --> 02:02:00.421
I'm not going anywhere.

02:02:02.146 --> 02:02:04.114
After all you know me, S.P.

02:02:09.982 --> 02:02:10.982
Yeah.

02:02:12.536 --> 02:02:13.848
I know you.

02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.716
And you've never lied to me.

02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:21.787
No.

02:02:31.659 --> 02:02:34.869
Just as fast
as I always was, huh?

02:02:37.043 --> 02:02:39.045
You wouldn't make it
to the door.

02:02:45.259 --> 02:02:46.708
What have I done?

02:04:23.799 --> 02:04:25.076
You got him, S.P.

02:04:27.078 --> 02:04:29.426
Well, I'll take it from here.

02:05:10.398 --> 02:05:11.951
Can we agree on this?

02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:15.886
Is that a full metal jacket
cartridge?

02:05:19.061 --> 02:05:21.823
Yes, sir. That is..

02:05:21.857 --> 02:05:24.826
That is a full metal jacket
rifle cartridge.

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:26.241
Oh, please, please

02:05:26.275 --> 02:05:28.208
please, don't do this, please.

02:05:28.243 --> 02:05:30.763
- Alright, come on.
- Don't do it, please!

02:06:21.192 --> 02:06:22.400
No, no.

02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.851
I can't focus.

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.129
It's too close.

02:08:32.323 --> 02:08:33.531
Perfect.

02:08:40.159 --> 02:08:41.470
Jack!

02:08:49.306 --> 02:08:50.687
Jack!

02:09:11.708 --> 02:09:12.778
Who are you?

02:09:13.675 --> 02:09:15.090
Call me Verge.

02:09:21.545 --> 02:09:23.340
How did you get in here?

02:09:26.446 --> 02:09:27.655
What do you want?

02:09:28.725 --> 02:09:31.313
As I see it,
it's you who called me.

02:09:39.839 --> 02:09:43.774
I've been with you for a while,
you just didn't notice me.

02:09:59.997 --> 02:10:03.138
So, did you come here
to stop me?

02:10:05.693 --> 02:10:08.350
I haven't come here to stop you
from anything.

02:10:08.385 --> 02:10:10.836
I just have one question.

02:10:13.562 --> 02:10:16.117
What's the question?

02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:19.810
Wasn't there something about
you building a house?

02:10:22.019 --> 02:10:24.884
Wasn't Jack going to
build a house?

02:10:33.582 --> 02:10:34.791
Yes.

02:10:37.034 --> 02:10:40.106
I... I... I was..

02:10:44.801 --> 02:10:46.043
...trying..

02:10:47.217 --> 02:10:49.081
...but I didn't get very far.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.546
This is the police.

02:11:06.581 --> 02:11:09.308
Come out with your hands
where we can see them

02:11:14.934 --> 02:11:17.626
I can see it's going to be
a bit difficult

02:11:17.661 --> 02:11:20.698
to get that house built,
but perhaps another one.

02:11:24.219 --> 02:11:27.119
Think, Jack, after all
you are an engineer

02:11:27.153 --> 02:11:29.224
and call yourself an architect.

02:11:36.162 --> 02:11:38.509
I've been told you have an
interesting theory

02:11:38.544 --> 02:11:41.789
about the material

02:11:41.823 --> 02:11:45.206
which you claim
has its own will.

02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:48.209
Find the material, Jack

02:11:48.243 --> 02:11:50.211
and let it do the work.

02:12:43.574 --> 02:12:45.922
Your house is a fine little
house, Jack.

02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:51.065
It's absolutely usable.

02:13:09.255 --> 02:13:10.878
Are you coming, Jack?

02:13:58.995 --> 02:14:02.895
I'm here... Jack.

02:14:11.007 --> 02:14:13.181
May I ask you something?

02:14:13.216 --> 02:14:15.494
I can't promise I'll answer.

02:14:16.944 --> 02:14:19.705
R... right,
that is exactly what I meant.

02:14:21.051 --> 02:14:23.812
Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?

02:14:25.124 --> 02:14:27.368
I was thinking
there might be rules.

02:14:28.541 --> 02:14:29.991
Put it this way

02:14:30.026 --> 02:14:33.857
very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.

02:14:33.891 --> 02:14:36.101
People are overcome
with a strange

02:14:36.135 --> 02:14:39.483
and sudden need
to confess on these trips.

02:14:39.518 --> 02:14:41.382
And not all of it can be said

02:14:41.416 --> 02:14:45.006
to be of great
rhetorical quality

02:14:45.041 --> 02:14:46.870
but do carry on merrily

02:14:46.904 --> 02:14:49.597
just don't believe you're
going to tell me something

02:14:49.631 --> 02:14:51.564
I haven't heard before.

02:16:29.835 --> 02:16:31.630
Do you hear a buzzing sound?

02:16:31.664 --> 02:16:32.664
Yes.

02:16:33.804 --> 02:16:35.841
And I don't think
you want to know

02:16:35.875 --> 02:16:37.636
where it's coming from.

02:16:41.502 --> 02:16:43.090
I wanna know everything.

02:16:44.815 --> 02:16:47.163
For thousands of years
human beings

02:16:47.197 --> 02:16:50.062
have tried to localize hell.

02:16:50.097 --> 02:16:51.442
Among other methods

02:16:51.477 --> 02:16:55.308
by seeking the sound
it generates.

02:16:55.343 --> 02:16:59.968
One shouldn't focus on
extracting screams and wailing

02:17:00.003 --> 02:17:03.179
because the cries of pain
of so many millions

02:17:03.213 --> 02:17:05.664
of individuals together..

02:17:07.665 --> 02:17:10.117
...becomes what you have
just heard.

02:17:10.151 --> 02:17:13.016
A buzzing sound whose intensity

02:17:13.049 --> 02:17:15.777
will increase
as we get ever closer

02:17:15.812 --> 02:17:18.090
to the presence of suffering.

02:18:49.975 --> 02:18:51.356
Verge?

02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:53.184
I'm here, Jack.

02:19:03.781 --> 02:19:05.784
I don't feel so good, Verge.

02:19:09.857 --> 02:19:11.790
There's a sour taste
in my mouth.

02:19:13.170 --> 02:19:16.726
You want me to show you the way
to the next whiskey bar?

02:20:56.826 --> 02:20:59.346
Those are the Elysian Fields.

02:21:02.901 --> 02:21:04.799
We don't have access here.

02:23:07.163 --> 02:23:10.338
That's how deep
the deepest hell goes.

02:23:17.967 --> 02:23:21.004
It's actually not here
I'm to deliver you..

02:23:22.799 --> 02:23:25.215
...however improbable
that may sound..

02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:28.598
...but a couple of circles
higher up.

02:23:36.261 --> 02:23:39.022
I took you down here
as a kind of a favor..

02:23:40.541 --> 02:23:44.649
...because you did after all
give me a little to chew on

02:23:44.683 --> 02:23:46.996
with your story,
and I understood

02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:49.239
that you wanted to see it all.

02:24:05.290 --> 02:24:09.018
When you are done looking,
we'll turn back.

02:24:13.954 --> 02:24:15.818
Where does that path lead?

02:24:16.853 --> 02:24:18.303
On the other side.

02:24:20.650 --> 02:24:25.206
It leads out of hell and up.

02:24:27.795 --> 02:24:31.281
As you can see
there was once a bridge

02:24:31.316 --> 02:24:33.352
but that was before my time.

02:24:42.189 --> 02:24:45.606
Isn't it possible
to climb all the way around?

02:24:49.576 --> 02:24:50.887
This way..

02:24:52.268 --> 02:24:54.235
...and make it over
to the other side?

02:24:56.652 --> 02:25:00.172
