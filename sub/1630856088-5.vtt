00:22.564 --> 00:23.941
I know what this is.

00:25.734 --> 00:30.030
You think you can intimidate me
with all this secret "black ops" bullshit?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
Good luck.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.600
Hey!

01:01.019 --> 01:02.312
Where is Colonel Shaw?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.566
I know you guys can hear me!

01:08.068 --> 01:10.195
I want to talk to someone in charge!

01:11.488 --> 01:12.739
<i>My father is</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:14.157
<i>Hiroshi Randa!</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:15.784
<i>Randa!</i>

03:00.264 --> 03:01.515
Feeling better?

03:02.724 --> 03:05.602
I can still count to ten on my toes.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.605
You're very lucky we rescued you
when we did.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.690
You didn't.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.734
- Kentaro did.
- What were you doing out there?

03:13.944 --> 03:17.030
I assume you were following the data
on our stolen files.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.617
We couldn't recover anything.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.619
Maybe you're not as good as you think.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.497
But a smart girl like you
would have a backup, no?

03:26.623 --> 03:29.376
- Out there in the ether.
- Shouldn't you be off

03:29.376 --> 03:32.754
chasing big, scary monsters or something?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.716
You know, there's one not too far
from here.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.720
We have a team in place.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.055
They've never seen anything like it.

03:42.931 --> 03:48.770
You know, traditionally,
when someone discovers a new species,

03:49.813 --> 03:51.565
they get to name it for themselves.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.152
But we have a dilemma here.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.155
Should we call it...

04:00.282 --> 04:03.660
<i>Titanus May Hewitt</i>?

04:04.661 --> 04:05.662
Or...

04:06.830 --> 04:07.831
is it...

04:10.042 --> 04:14.588
Lyra Mateo of Tacoma, Washington?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.135
That picture doesn't really look like you.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.984
It's not crazy to think
we could help each other.

04:38.737 --> 04:43.825
Like I said, it's always good
to have a backup, no?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.681
The Randa children know nothing.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.767
Wait. Hang on a sec. No. That's--

05:08.767 --> 05:13.480
No, they are Hiroshi Randa's kids.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.400
They are Bill and Keiko Randa's grandkids.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.610
We're treating them
like they're criminals.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.696
Says the man who tried to abduct them.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.489
Okay. Mistakes were made.

05:22.489 --> 05:27.286
She's a schoolteacher, okay?
No record. The son is "an artist."

05:27.286 --> 05:28.370
What about her?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.123
This one is interesting.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.834
From the way she swept her apartment,
she knows how to disappear.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.420
Why?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.297
What is she hiding from?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.717
Unclear. There's no outstanding warrants.
No one seems to be looking for her.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.844
At least, not officially.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.554
So, what do we do with them?

05:48.140 --> 05:52.644
This organization is in their blood.
We can teach them who they are.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.563
You don't mean recruit them?

05:54.563 --> 05:56.565
Monarch is their legacy.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.444
Legacy hasn't served people well
around here, has it?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.740
You end up dead... or close to it.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.617
Well, he's right about one thing.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.076
They're looking for something.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.163
It has to do with their father.
So, fine, it has to do with Monarch.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.332
And I guess they're not going to give up, right?

06:14.750 --> 06:18.587
So I say we put them on a long leash,
see where they lead us.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.755
What about him?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.056
He's my problem now.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.412
Hi.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.456
Why don't you guys go ahead
and come on out?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.542
Please do watch your step though.
It's slippery.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.884
Passports.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.431
New and clean.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.728
And plane tickets, money, phones.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.063
Courtesy of Monarch.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.066
I'm very sorry about all of this.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.442
- Prick.
- Asshole.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.780
I'm genuinely sorry for your loss.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.490
Thank you, prick-asshole.

07:34.413 --> 07:35.414
What do you think?

07:36.123 --> 07:40.502
That you're on some righteous crusade
to uncover the truth, huh?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.881
Wake up!

07:44.548 --> 07:47.050
You stuck your noses
in shit you don't understand.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.553
You are goddamn lucky to be alive.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.847
So take your shiny new passports
and go home.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.933
I've already used
what little influence I have

07:54.933 --> 07:56.393
to cover your asses this time.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.021
Don't expect it to happen again.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.072
- How was that?
- You're learning.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.227
"I'm sorry for your loss." Like they care.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.062
Clearly not. Basic economy.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.274
Hey, what time is this flight boarding?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.861
Tokyo.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.530
Wowee.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.075
That's a ways from here.
How did you enjoy your time in Alaska?

08:53.075 --> 08:56.078
I didn't. And that'll be reflected
in my Tripadvisor review.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.204
Two stars tops.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.289
Wait. You're leaving?

08:59.289 --> 09:03.126
Yeah. You heard the man.
We have lives to get back to.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.461
What life?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.380
In Tokyo? The one you said I destroyed.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.007
I have to do...

09:10.259 --> 09:12.469
Stop it.
Is there a bar anywhere, somewhere?

09:13.595 --> 09:14.721
It's not open yet.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.806
One star.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.518
Excuse me. Just--

09:21.186 --> 09:22.312
Sorry.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.273
- What about Colonel Shaw?
- What about him?

09:24.273 --> 09:27.359
Everything he said turned out to be true.
He knew our father was still alive.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.862
No. No, he did not. And neither do you.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.322
But we don't know that he's dead either.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.157
Not anymore.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.952
I'm not stopping.
I need to know what happened to him.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.328
Okay. So what now?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.749
Monarch may know how to find the Titans,
but they don't know how to find Dad.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.586
Do we? I already searched his office an--

09:45.586 --> 09:47.421
Not the one in San Francisco.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.089
Backup family. Backup office.

09:49.715 --> 09:50.799
Worth a shot, right?

09:52.176 --> 09:55.387
I'm assuming you have a copy of the files
in the cloud somewhere, May.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.724
Y'all can have the files.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.728
- But they could get you killed.
- Or you.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.563
We can't split up.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.065
We need you.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.631
How's it going, Lee?

11:13.674 --> 11:16.093
Deputy Director Verdugo.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.011
I should have known.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.973
How is the view from the almost top?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.810
Almost high enough.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.687
Well, you're young.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.771
Life's long.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.483
The Randa boy had that film on him.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.569
I'd never seen it.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.030
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.699
It's kinda funny.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.201
I mean, feels a little more
like you're sitting on them, you know?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.329
Weighing them down,
doing what Monarch does best.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.874
And what's that, Colonel?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.000
Nothing.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.503
Absolutely nothing.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.885
And traipsing around the globe
with Hiroshi Randa's kids,

11:57.885 --> 11:59.136
that's doing something?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.680
Those kids have already survived
more situations

12:01.680 --> 12:04.141
than half the people you got
working in your field out there.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.268
And you nearly got them killed.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.353
They're a lot tougher than you think.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.564
Not so much.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.734
They're scared. They're gullible.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.862
- Chatty.
- Stop.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.822
They don't know anything.
I made sure of that.

12:18.822 --> 12:19.948
And you already know it.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.167
You ever think Hiroshi had a reason
for not telling his kids what he did here?

12:33.212 --> 12:35.297
Maybe he didn't want this life for them.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.883
I have thought about that, actually.
Quite a lot.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.677
I'll ask him when I see him.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.933
I'm assuming you don't mean
in the afterlife.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.100
No.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.395
- You're not going anywhere.
- And you're not getting anywhere, are you?

12:51.021 --> 12:53.607
Deputy... Director.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.868
You say he helped found Monarch.
But that was in the '50s.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.496
Forties actually,
though he came a few years later.

13:07.496 --> 13:10.541
So he should be, what? Ninety, at least?
How does he look like that?

13:11.083 --> 13:15.587
There's rumors of a mission gone bad.
But it's classified.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.631
Who is he now?

13:17.631 --> 13:20.592
How did he go
straight from an old folks home

13:20.592 --> 13:24.304
to finding a Titan no one
in the entire organization knew existed?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.933
What does he know?
And don't tell me it's all in the files.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.481
Probably is.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.291
The car will be here in ten minutes.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.834
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

13:53.834 --> 13:55.878
<i>In uncertain times,</i>

13:56.378 --> 13:59.548
<i>when unspeakable disasters strike
without warning,</i>

13:59.548 --> 14:01.425
<i>the lucky might survive,</i>

14:02.009 --> 14:04.178
<i>but the smart will thrive.</i>

14:04.720 --> 14:09.183
<i>Straata Secure Homes is a below-ground,
multi-level luxury living galleria,</i>

14:09.183 --> 14:12.311
<i>offering titanium-forged
subterranean safety</i>

14:12.311 --> 14:14.479
<i>from our violent, unstable world...</i>

14:14.479 --> 14:16.315
But who wants to live in a custom bunker?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.152
Tech bros. Only ones who can afford it.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.660
Hey.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.538
You good?

14:33.582 --> 14:35.959
Not how I thought I'd make my first trip
to the States.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.296
What? Feeling lost?

14:39.838 --> 14:43.300
Unsure of what you're looking for,
what you're gonna find.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.803
You know, that's how she must have felt,
landing on your doorstep.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.062
Cate!

15:01.276 --> 15:02.277
Damn it.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.867
I'm sorry. What kind of car did you order?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.369
- Who is this?
- It's James.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.162
Cate.

15:12.663 --> 15:16.291
- Hey, welcome home.
- What are you doing here, James?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.543
I told Mom we'd be fine.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.919
But we're not fine.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.299
Hello. I'm James, Caroline's work friend.
Pleasure to meet you.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.636
These are my friends not from work,
May and Kentaro.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.096
- Welcome.
- Hey.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.765
Welcome. Hop in.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.891
I got us a car.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.102
- Cancel it.
- I don't wanna cancel it.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.645
I told Mom we'd take a ride-share.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.941
She insisted.

15:40.941 --> 15:45.404
And it's my pleasure.
I'm here already. So grab your coat.

15:45.404 --> 15:46.780
Grab your coat.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.491
She's okay. Let's roll.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.285
Hit the road!

16:03.463 --> 16:07.176
FEMA tried relocating people,
but most didn't wanna go.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.845
Hard to walk away
from San Francisco real estate.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.098
Is it true they're selling tours
of the destroyed city?

16:14.016 --> 16:17.352
They did.
Before the military walled it off.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.105
"Trauma tourists,"
getting off on the disaster porn

16:20.105 --> 16:23.483
or trying to prove
it was all a government conspiracy.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.736
Sick freaks.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.948
My mother tried signing up for one...

16:31.241 --> 16:32.492
to find my father.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.091
Get over there.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.386
- Good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.471
Take care of yourself.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.809
Tell your mom I'll see her tonight.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.728
Welcome back.

16:59.728 --> 17:00.812
Thanks.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.444
He seems very American.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.911
We're gonna go on a walk.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.330
Yeah. Just give you guys
some time alone first.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.708
Good idea.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.377
You can break it to her gently.

17:23.919 --> 17:25.503
Like I did with your mom?

17:25.503 --> 17:28.632
Wow. Cate, you're back.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.303
You're back.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.768
Hey.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.479
And you've brought some friends.

17:43.564 --> 17:46.692
Mom, this is May and Kentaro.

17:48.569 --> 17:49.570
I'm Caroline.

17:49.570 --> 17:50.654
Hi. Pleasure.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.114
Nice to meet you.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.198
Welcome.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.451
Wow. So you both come from Tokyo?

17:57.870 --> 17:59.246
- Yeah.
- Which part?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.622
Because my husband used to
travel there a lot--

18:00.622 --> 18:02.457
Mom, this is Kentaro Randa.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.548
You asked what I found in Tokyo.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.562
You must be so tired,
having come from so far.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.647
Why don't you come on in?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.486
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry for the mess.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.075
James and I-- James is my work friend--

18:38.619 --> 18:41.371
we collect people's personal items
from the ruins.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.458
And it always seems I'm bringing work
home with me.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.668
Please have a seat.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.253
Mom.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.299
You know, people are so funny.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.593
They never ask for money or valuables.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.762
They always seem to be
asking for these things.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.555
Their personal memories.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.099
Mom, stop.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.851
- Wait, let me help you.
- I got--

19:05.479 --> 19:06.480
Stop!

19:09.066 --> 19:10.400
I got it.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.671
Why don't you guys wait in my room?
It's down the hall on the left.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.936
What the hell is going on?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.315
Quite a lot, actually.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.817
You know what I mean.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.778
Inviting him in to get settled

19:54.778 --> 19:57.155
like your husband's secret son
walks in every day.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.909
What do you expect me to do?
Throw him out?

20:02.703 --> 20:03.912
Have a hysterical breakdown?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.831
Go for it. I wouldn't blame you.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.250
It's okay.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.505
Cate.

20:14.548 --> 20:15.549
Cate...

20:19.970 --> 20:22.431
Your father was never really all here.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.101
And when you found that lease,

20:26.852 --> 20:28.353
I thought maybe that you could...

20:29.188 --> 20:31.899
find out if he was having an affair
or had a girlfriend--

20:31.899 --> 20:33.192
So you sent me there.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.861
- But--
- You pushed and you pushed

20:35.861 --> 20:37.196
because you wanted the truth,

20:37.196 --> 20:39.156
but you were too chickenshit
to go yourself.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.327
Don't talk to me like that. I only wanted
what was best for you and--

20:43.327 --> 20:46.038
- And this was it?
- Yes. Yes.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.584
Okay, I pushed you.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.878
What was I supposed to do?

20:52.878 --> 20:57.549
You spent all day, every day,
wasting away in that room of yours.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.259
You wouldn't even try any support groups--

20:59.259 --> 21:02.054
Because pottery classes are gonna
bring my kids back from the dead.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.060
You couldn't even lift a finger
to help yourself.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.187
It was my choice.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.816
And I wasn't going to sit around
and watch my daughter kill herself.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.906
Fine. You wanted to get me out of my room.

21:21.615 --> 21:22.866
Give me something to live for.

21:23.659 --> 21:24.826
Mission accomplished.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.746
We're going to Dad's office.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.540
What? Why?

21:29.540 --> 21:31.041
To find what else he was hiding from us.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.085
We don't even know
if there's anything left of his office.

21:33.085 --> 21:35.087
Well, you can get us into the city
to find out.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.755
No, not into the red zone.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.883
The military has it cordoned off.
They're arresting looters every day.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.260
Some of them even get shot.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.136
So they're getting in.
We'll go in with them.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.041
Hey there.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.794
Hey. Where's Colby tonight?

22:15.794 --> 22:18.046
- Kid's got the flu.
- Again?

22:25.262 --> 22:28.015
Here you go. For your troubles.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.392
We don't wanna hold your line up.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.105
All right, open it up.

22:36.273 --> 22:37.232
Hey!

22:38.358 --> 22:40.527
Get these folks moving.
They're good to go.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.237
- <i>We're good to go.</i>
- Roger that.

22:45.657 --> 22:46.742
All right. We're good.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.161
All clear.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.791
Hope you get a day off tomorrow, Carla.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.002
You deserve it.

22:57.628 --> 22:58.629
Thanks.

22:58.629 --> 22:59.713
Good to go.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.593
All right. Let them through.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.728
How can anyone believe this is fake?

23:57.729 --> 24:00.190
It's easier than waking up every day
and thinking,

24:00.899 --> 24:02.860
at any moment,
the same could happen to you.

24:10.576 --> 24:12.661
All right. This is as far as we can go.

24:13.245 --> 24:17.791
The guards make sure that
everybody we bring in comes out with us.

24:17.791 --> 24:21.420
If they catch you,
they'll assume you're looters.

24:22.254 --> 24:25.883
No questions, no excuses. You understand?

24:26.466 --> 24:28.427
And we need to leave by morning.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.304
All of us, together.

24:30.304 --> 24:31.513
We'll be here at 8:00.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.224
At 8:15, they close the gates.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.601
Mom, we get it.

24:35.601 --> 24:36.977
I hope so.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.796
<i>Yeah, I didn't like what they did to you,</i>

25:05.297 --> 25:08.467
<i>after everything you sacrificed
for this organization.</i>

25:08.467 --> 25:10.093
<i>I think you mean that.</i>

25:10.093 --> 25:12.095
<i>Did you lift any fingers
to do anything about it?</i>

25:12.095 --> 25:15.182
I did what I could.
It wasn't my day to run the company.

25:15.182 --> 25:16.850
Still isn't, apparently.

25:20.812 --> 25:24.525
You went decades between escape attempts.

25:24.525 --> 25:26.693
Why start raising hell again now?

25:26.693 --> 25:31.823
The world is on fire.
I decided to do something about it.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.578
Do you wanna help?

25:37.412 --> 25:38.914
I'd like to think I am.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.208
<i>We have the smartest people on the planet
working on it.</i>

25:41.208 --> 25:42.709
Colonel, you can stand down.

25:43.377 --> 25:46.797
"The smartest people on the planet"
have had 60 years to prepare for G-Day.

25:47.673 --> 25:48.674
"Let 'em fight."

25:49.800 --> 25:51.385
<i>That's the best they could come up with?</i>

25:52.261 --> 25:56.515
What if Godzilla had lost?

25:59.476 --> 26:01.019
What's hiding in Bill Randa's files?

26:01.019 --> 26:04.606
Nothing you don't already know,
and everything you don't wanna believe.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.691
Word games.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.652
Is that what it's gonna be, Colonel?

26:08.652 --> 26:10.445
You think you had it rough,

26:10.445 --> 26:12.948
playing shuffleboard
and trimming your bonsai trees?

26:12.948 --> 26:15.033
I never said I had it rough.
I got pretty good at bocce ball--

26:15.033 --> 26:16.159
I swear to God,

26:17.369 --> 26:21.498
I can bury you deep
or I can bury you shallow.

26:24.668 --> 26:25.669
Your call.

26:27.004 --> 26:28.005
Bury me?

26:29.506 --> 26:31.216
Who's playing word games now?

26:32.050 --> 26:34.720
And wasting time none of us have.

26:35.804 --> 26:39.224
<i>Monarch is wrong.</i>

26:40.642 --> 26:41.810
<i>And has been...</i>

26:42.811 --> 26:45.772
for a long, long time.

27:13.509 --> 27:14.635
Were you not listening?

27:16.261 --> 27:17.513
They shoot looters.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.515
I'm eating the evidence.

27:26.271 --> 27:29.650
Even if a building looks undamaged,
the attack undermined the foundations.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.652
So sometimes you'll hear one
just suddenly collapse.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.947
Let's go.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.100
I used to grade papers here.

28:05.018 --> 28:06.436
Was this your neighborhood?

28:06.937 --> 28:07.938
Yeah.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.901
It was our favorite little coffee shop.

28:19.825 --> 28:22.494
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.747
I needed this.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.342
I needed that.

28:48.353 --> 28:49.855
<i>How long have you been waiting?</i>

28:49.855 --> 28:54.151
I was up and out by 5:30.
Trying to dodge Mrs. Yee.

28:54.151 --> 28:56.570
Yeah, of course.
It's the first of the month.

28:56.570 --> 29:00.699
It's turning into a real cat and mouse.
She's got all my escape routes covered.

29:01.783 --> 29:06.747
You know, you're paying a fortune
for an apartment that you're never at.

29:06.747 --> 29:10.083
And it's cheaper to live with two
rather than one.

29:11.877 --> 29:13.879
Look, you don't have to choose between

29:13.879 --> 29:18.133
your Ethiopian dark roast
or food every day.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.349
Haven't you learned your lesson?

29:26.975 --> 29:27.976
Haven't you?

29:36.902 --> 29:40.489
Why don't you tell Mrs. Yee
that you're putting in your notice

29:40.489 --> 29:44.201
and that you'll be out
by the end of the month.

29:57.631 --> 29:58.966
So it begins.

30:14.356 --> 30:15.899
The teacher's coming.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.568
No phones in class.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.862
I told you guys.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.323
Where is everyone?

30:23.949 --> 30:25.158
They stayed home.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.369
Their parents are scared of
the giant monsters.

30:27.369 --> 30:28.579
Mine aren't.

30:28.579 --> 30:32.082
My dad said it's a hoax
to burst the real estate balloon.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.426
All right. Phones away.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.431
Chad's father's probably right.
This has to be a prank of some kind.

30:48.891 --> 30:50.058
Everyone okay here?

30:52.436 --> 30:54.021
- Cate?
- We're fine.

30:54.897 --> 30:57.983
Today's lesson: Don't believe
everything you see on the Internet.

30:59.151 --> 31:01.111
We're monitoring the situation closely.

31:01.111 --> 31:02.446
Make sure their phones are charged

31:02.446 --> 31:04.781
and they all know
their family reunification plans.

31:05.574 --> 31:07.576
We'll let you know
if we decide to close the school.

31:11.663 --> 31:12.873
Ms. Randa.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.959
Are they coming here next?

31:22.090 --> 31:24.551
It's like a cat lady's fantasy island.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.430
Or a cat man's.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.143
My uncle is a cat man.

31:35.395 --> 31:36.396
Cool.

31:55.874 --> 31:56.875
We should keep moving.

32:02.631 --> 32:04.341
Yeah, I'll check it out.

32:04.341 --> 32:05.634
Over there.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.515
Who's there?
Come out where we can see you!

32:23.402 --> 32:25.404
- Where's this one headed?
- North, towards the Golden Gate.

32:25.404 --> 32:26.822
- Come on in.
- Come on.

32:26.822 --> 32:29.032
Eva, come on. Just leave it. It's okay.

32:29.032 --> 32:30.951
- How can I help?
- It's up to you.

32:30.951 --> 32:33.370
I'm staying with the kids in the gym
until they get picked up.

32:33.954 --> 32:35.038
You go ahead. I'll be right there.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.498
The mayor said shelter
in the BART stations.

32:36.498 --> 32:38.917
Yeah, and we will
if the parents don't show up.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.711
I don't know where those fools think
they're going.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.671
They're only letting buses
across the bridges.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.464
Cate, are you chaperoning this one?

32:44.464 --> 32:46.383
I can take it if you want to stay
with Dani.

32:46.383 --> 32:47.467
Pull up.

32:50.679 --> 32:54.600
You're in violation of a federal order.
Come out slowly.

33:02.024 --> 33:03.525
Yo, come on out!

33:09.990 --> 33:11.283
I know you're around here.

33:11.783 --> 33:12.784
Cate.

33:14.411 --> 33:15.454
I got this.

33:30.636 --> 33:31.637
You got movement?

33:38.101 --> 33:39.603
Just more goddamn cats.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.355
Think we should start shooting them.

33:41.355 --> 33:42.856
- Come on, man.
- Yeah.

33:42.856 --> 33:43.941
Yeah, I'm serious.

33:49.613 --> 33:50.822
You all right?

33:52.115 --> 33:53.116
I'm fine.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.638
Oh, yeah. We'll be there in no time.

34:15.389 --> 34:16.389
This way.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.071
Anyone know a good song?

34:36.118 --> 34:37.119
Lower the volume.

34:40.998 --> 34:43.583
Get out of my way.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.259
Quiet.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.516
Tastes so good! This is it.

35:03.896 --> 35:05.856
Dad would sing these cheesy commercials.

35:06.773 --> 35:09.234
He'd make his serious,
time-to-listen-to-me face

35:09.234 --> 35:11.737
and then do something so silly.

35:12.446 --> 35:13.530
Yeah.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.454
<i>What is the secret of the triangle shape?</i>

35:22.372 --> 35:24.958
<i>The secret of deliciousness is...</i>

35:24.958 --> 35:26.293
<i>I'm not going to tell you!</i>

35:26.293 --> 35:28.504
- <i>Tada!</i>
- Let's use our inside voices.

35:30.464 --> 35:33.091
Do you remember the Arnold ones?

35:33.091 --> 35:34.301
Hey! Come here!

35:37.554 --> 35:38.889
Go!

35:45.270 --> 35:46.271
Down here.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.066
All right.

35:50.359 --> 35:51.401
Go around.

35:52.486 --> 35:53.487
This way.

36:01.787 --> 36:02.788
It's okay.

36:08.836 --> 36:10.212
- They went this way.
- Help me.

36:11.213 --> 36:12.422
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

36:13.674 --> 36:15.050
This way.

36:15.050 --> 36:16.677
I heard two!

36:18.387 --> 36:20.722
They're down here. I'm with you.

36:22.558 --> 36:23.725
Let's go.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.979
No trespassing in the secured area.

36:37.406 --> 36:39.283
Hey, you! Get 'em!

36:39.283 --> 36:40.659
Get on the ground!

36:41.368 --> 36:43.203
You people can't be living down here!

36:43.787 --> 36:44.788
Stop!

36:49.585 --> 36:51.920
- Let's check over here.
- Come on.

36:53.839 --> 36:55.465
- Which way?
- This way.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.550
Let's go.

37:05.601 --> 37:06.727
Hey.

37:07.644 --> 37:10.063
Come on. Keep going. Like this.

37:10.063 --> 37:12.858
No. You go ahead without me.

37:14.818 --> 37:15.903
Cate, we need you.

37:15.903 --> 37:19.531
- We're going together or not at all.
- Yeah. Come on, you can do this.

37:19.531 --> 37:20.741
You've come this far.

37:22.117 --> 37:24.912
- You got it, yeah?
- Okay.

38:15.379 --> 38:17.714
- We'll have to try another way.
- There's so many ways.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.633
- One of them goes through.
- No, you don't know that.

38:19.633 --> 38:22.177
You can't know that.
We're gonna die down here.

38:22.177 --> 38:23.637
You'll be all right.

38:25.848 --> 38:27.558
I'm sorry, Cate.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.853
But you are strong.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.896
You'll be all right.

38:33.939 --> 38:35.941
What do you have to do
that's more important than us?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.282
I'll just go ahead and find a way out.

38:45.868 --> 38:46.869
Just go.

38:54.585 --> 38:57.379
Dad!

39:03.177 --> 39:05.262
Do you wanna sit down?

39:12.394 --> 39:13.520
Give me this.

39:14.313 --> 39:15.314
Okay.

39:21.278 --> 39:22.696
Breathe with me.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.449
No, I can't.

39:25.449 --> 39:28.785
Bullshit. Yes, you can. Come on, Randa.

39:29.745 --> 39:30.746
In.

39:32.164 --> 39:33.332
Out.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.168
Good job. One more.

39:36.710 --> 39:37.711
In.

39:39.796 --> 39:40.797
Out.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.469
Can you feel my hands?

39:46.220 --> 39:47.429
Yeah.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.056
Look at me.

39:52.935 --> 39:54.937
Don't see anything else but me.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.242
Hey.

40:09.576 --> 40:10.827
You're not that late yet.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.001
Are you moving?

40:25.759 --> 40:27.177
No, I'll go. It's fine.

40:27.177 --> 40:28.512
Go. Now.

40:31.306 --> 40:32.516
Emily, come on.

40:34.142 --> 40:36.770
Cate, I didn't learn my lesson.

40:38.105 --> 40:41.942
We were good.
You just-- You don't want good.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.076
I don't deserve this.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.995
I don't think anyone deserves this.

40:52.995 --> 40:56.874
No, I mean
that anyone would do shit for me

40:56.874 --> 40:59.585
when all I ever do is let 'em down.

41:00.836 --> 41:05.883
I hate him for leaving.
But how am I any better?

41:06.466 --> 41:10.721
You didn't let me down
when I was freezing to death in Alaska.

41:14.850 --> 41:17.811
The only way out is through.

41:23.108 --> 41:25.319
- I found a way up.
- What?

41:25.319 --> 41:26.612
Just follow the cats.

42:00.354 --> 42:03.148
- What floor is it on?
- Dad loved a view.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.069
Okay.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.007
Okay.

42:29.007 --> 42:30.884
Hell, wouldn't it be funny

42:30.884 --> 42:33.053
if there was nothing left
behind this door?

42:34.513 --> 42:35.514
Hilarious.

43:24.396 --> 43:25.856
At least we know where to look.

43:34.698 --> 43:39.077
What? No. There has to be something.

43:39.578 --> 43:41.163
Okay, the sun's coming up.

43:41.163 --> 43:43.624
So, let's just remember,
we gotta get out of here soon.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.084
That's not being helpful. Be helpful.

43:46.084 --> 43:48.253
I don't know your dad like that.

43:58.430 --> 44:01.141
I used to think this had
something to do with his satellite work.

44:02.309 --> 44:03.310
What do you mean?

44:06.813 --> 44:09.149
The orbital arcs of satellites
are sine waves.

44:09.149 --> 44:13.987
These pathways... they're something else.

44:15.113 --> 44:17.741
You listened to Dad when he was
talking about that satellite stuff?

44:17.741 --> 44:20.661
I teach science to middle schoolers.
They ask questions.

44:23.247 --> 44:24.331
Let me see the files.

44:30.629 --> 44:31.755
Okay.

44:36.885 --> 44:38.220
These points--

44:38.220 --> 44:39.888
They're like constellations.

44:41.139 --> 44:42.307
But it's not a star map.

44:43.016 --> 44:44.268
No.

44:44.268 --> 44:48.105
It's a world map,
but he's hidden the continents.

45:02.536 --> 45:03.579
Give me that.

45:09.418 --> 45:10.419
What are you doing?

45:12.337 --> 45:14.131
Can you hold that up over there?

45:24.349 --> 45:25.392
Why are we doing this?

45:26.268 --> 45:29.021
My first art installation
was about projected images.

45:29.646 --> 45:33.108
How putting one image on another
can reveal something completely new.

45:33.609 --> 45:34.818
Yeah, I remember.

45:55.422 --> 45:56.423
Yeah.

46:08.519 --> 46:09.811
San Francisco.

46:10.896 --> 46:12.397
Alaska.

46:16.443 --> 46:17.319
Africa.

46:20.489 --> 46:22.074
This must be the path he took.

46:22.950 --> 46:24.868
Yes, this is it.

46:24.868 --> 46:28.121
This is what we wanted.
High fives all around. We gotta go.

46:54.690 --> 46:56.316
So, you and James.

46:57.734 --> 46:59.152
Are you guys...

47:01.446 --> 47:05.158
He's waiting for me to be ready.

47:07.619 --> 47:09.413
I'm sorry for what Dad did to you.

47:10.414 --> 47:12.040
Thirty years. You wasted your life on him.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.375
No, I--

47:16.128 --> 47:19.673
I could have found out
that he was cheating on me.

47:20.299 --> 47:21.550
I could've asked.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.928
I could have gone to Tokyo.

47:26.263 --> 47:31.685
But I didn't wanna know the truth.
I liked having a part-time husband.

47:32.269 --> 47:34.771
But that meant that
you had a part-time father...

47:36.356 --> 47:38.233
and you deserved more than that.

47:51.580 --> 47:53.373
Dad didn't die in Alaska.

47:54.750 --> 47:55.751
What?

47:57.002 --> 48:03.217
He worked for some secret organization
like the CIA, but for Godzilla.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.432
I'm gonna find him.

48:17.147 --> 48:18.357
So, how are you feeling?

48:19.525 --> 48:20.526
Good.

48:21.026 --> 48:23.278
Like, for the first time
since my father disappeared,

48:23.278 --> 48:26.740
maybe everything isn't shit, you know?
Is that weird?

48:27.991 --> 48:31.995
I've recently updated my definition
for weird. So, I don't know.

48:34.581 --> 48:35.832
I'm gonna call my mom.

48:36.625 --> 48:38.502
Okay. Remember the rule.

48:38.502 --> 48:39.920
- Nonspecific.
- Yep.

49:11.159 --> 49:15.664
I wanna go home.
Tell me what I need to do.

49:19.626 --> 49:21.920
Smart girl. I'll be in touch.
