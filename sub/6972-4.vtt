That's somewhat comforting.

40:09.507 --> 40:12.777
- Look, I don't know what
the point of all this is.
- I'll prove it to you.

40:12.777 --> 40:16.447
No, you won't. But I wouldn't mind
if you came clean with me.

40:16.447 --> 40:19.917
Scientific proof about what happened
to us on that road two nights ago.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.753
- Fair enough?
- [ Door Opens ] 

40:22.753 --> 40:26.757
I am calling the police.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.226
- [ Door Slams ] 
- Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher.

40:29.226 --> 40:33.219
I will prove it
to you, Scully. Tonight.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.667
 I'll prove everything. 

40:36.667 --> 40:40.660
Okay?

 [ Car Engine Starts ] 

40:56.954 --> 41:00.947
[ Ringing ]

41:04.228 --> 41:06.464
- Howard Grodin.
- [ Morris ] Mr. Grodin?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.500
This is Special Agent Mulder of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.836
- How are you this morning?
- How did you get this number?

41:11.836 --> 41:14.171
Frankly, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

41:14.171 --> 41:17.842
Sir, I am obligated to tell you that you
have a security leak in your facility.

41:17.842 --> 41:21.835
A man with whom you have worked
very closely has contacted this
office on several occasions...

41:23.013 --> 41:26.283
and offered me access
to highly classified information.

41:26.283 --> 41:29.620
- Would you happen to have
a name for this man?
- Why, yes.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.613
Yes, I would.

42:30.748 --> 42:34.741
 [ Cell Phone Ringing ] 

42:35.252 --> 42:37.922
- Scully.
- You're in Nevada again.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.357
Uh, sir, I--

42:40.357 --> 42:42.993
[ Kersh ]
Do not speak, Agent. Listen.

42:42.993 --> 42:46.964
Your partner already apprised me of
his conversation with the air force...

42:46.964 --> 42:50.957
and his fervent desire to save you
from making a fatal career mistake.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.972
Therefore, you will follow
my instructions to the letter.

42:54.972 --> 42:57.007
Sir, I don't know
what Mulder told you--

42:57.007 --> 43:00.210
You will follow my instructions
to the letter.

43:00.210 --> 43:04.203
Otherwise don't bother
coming back from Nevada.

43:28.305 --> 43:32.298
Can I help you?

43:33.811 --> 43:37.804
Scully, I got it.
I got the proof.

- I'm sorry.
- Scully, you?

44:12.850 --> 44:15.719
- Damn it, Morris.
- You! You son of a bitch!

44:15.719 --> 44:19.657
You orchestrated this whole thing!
He's not me, Scully!

44:19.657 --> 44:22.993
Would I do this?
Would I do this?

44:22.993 --> 44:25.963
Scully! No, you bastard!
Tell her the truth!

44:25.963 --> 44:28.699
Scully, he's not me!

44:28.699 --> 44:31.035
He's not me!

44:31.035 --> 44:35.028
 Scully, he's not me! 

45:17.114 --> 45:18.816

 I made this! 

45:18.816 --> 45:22.809
