He's the greatest
dog in the world.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.417
[both] We've never had our
own action sequence before!

10:40.500 --> 10:42.709
Best vacation ever.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.458
Thank you for looking after
Milo, I'm so sorry...

10:45.542 --> 10:50.250
That was thrilling! Who knew
vacations could be so... Exciting.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.583
I guess Milo showed us there's more
to vacations than the Grand Canyon.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.792
That's my boy.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.792
It's like my dad always says,

10:56.875 --> 10:59.417
"Family vacations are
the only trip you take,

10:59.500 --> 11:03.625
where you go away to get closer
to what you already have."

11:03.709 --> 11:04.709
Jar!
