WEBVTT

00:40.207 --> 00:41.809
<i>Twelve seconds on the clock.</i>

00:41.843 --> 00:44.846
<i>Third down with 52 yards</i>
<i>to the end zone.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.848
<i>Yeah, Chuck,</i>
<i>they're about five yards shy</i>

00:46.881 --> 00:48.850
<i>from being</i>
<i>within field goal range.</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:51.385
<i>I really think</i>
<i>they're gonna need a Hail Mary</i>
<i>to make this play.</i>

00:51.418 --> 00:53.120
<i>And here's the hike.</i>

00:53.153 --> 00:55.723
<i>Boy wonder quarterback</i>
<i>Casey Rhodes got the ball.</i>

00:55.757 --> 00:58.325
<i>Landon Morris</i>
<i>has shut down Ben Roy.</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:00.460
<i>Rhodes is running it!</i>
<i>He's running it!</i>

01:00.494 --> 01:02.229
<i>And the crowd is loving it!</i>

01:02.262 --> 01:04.799
<i>And Rhodes is making a mockery</i>
<i>of Atlanta's defense!</i>

01:04.832 --> 01:06.834
<i>Jowon Briggs</i>
<i>is gaining on Rhodes.</i>

01:06.868 --> 01:09.236
<i>- Rhodes is gonna get up.</i>
<i>- He's going!</i>

01:09.269 --> 01:11.739
<i>- Oh! Whoa, whoa!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:11.773 --> 01:15.442
<i>Oh, Jowon Briggs sacked Rhodes</i>
<i>on the two-yard line.</i>

01:16.376 --> 01:18.513
<i>We are not made</i>
<i>to bend that way.</i>

01:18.546 --> 01:21.248
<i>Oh, that's devastating, Dave,</i>
<i>for Rhodes.</i>

01:21.281 --> 01:24.384
<i>All play-off hopes are gone</i>
<i>in one savage tackle.</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:28.221
- <i>Well, you know,</i> <i>Chuck, that's football.
- </i> -<i>That's football.</i>

01:40.735 --> 01:43.270
Hey, you guys gotta move.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.840
You're blocking us in.

01:45.873 --> 01:46.908
What the hell?

01:46.941 --> 01:48.676
Nathanial Wilson!

01:48.710 --> 01:52.312
You live at 1403 Angel Avenue
with your wife and daughter.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.849
Open the truck and forget
that I know where you live.

01:54.882 --> 01:58.452
Don't think about your job.
Think about your fucking family!

01:58.485 --> 01:59.787
Nathanial!

01:59.821 --> 02:01.221
Don't do it,
don't do it.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.930
Move. Give me the keys!

02:08.963 --> 02:10.330
Go!

02:11.198 --> 02:13.467
Get on your knees.
Hands behind your head.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.535
Do it!

02:17.337 --> 02:18.706
Thirty seconds to go.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.376
Twenty-nine, 28...

02:25.278 --> 02:27.214
Fifteen, 14...

02:29.216 --> 02:31.653
Twelve, 11, ten,

02:31.686 --> 02:35.890
nine, eight, seven...

02:35.923 --> 02:37.257
He's running!
You mother--

02:37.290 --> 02:40.728
...two, one.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.363
Time's up. Let's move!

02:48.736 --> 02:50.404
Come on, come on, come on.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.209
Check the alley.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.845
Knight, get your ass
downtown now!

03:04.519 --> 03:05.586
Let's go.

03:12.727 --> 03:14.896
Drop your keys!
Whoa! You can have the car.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.965
Get the fuck outta here!

03:19.967 --> 03:22.436
- Let's go!
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.005
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:24.038 --> 03:26.808
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

03:26.841 --> 03:28.676
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:28.710 --> 03:30.377
- You're up, Mike.
- I'm on it.

03:33.648 --> 03:36.584
Let's go!
Mike, let's go!

03:42.623 --> 03:44.291
Don't leave anyone behind.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.560
Let's go!

03:53.735 --> 03:55.235
Oh, for fuck's sake!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.574
Where are you going?

04:00.041 --> 04:01.274
Fuck!

04:02.710 --> 04:04.344
I'm going.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.028
Let's go!

04:25.900 --> 04:27.635
Come here, piggies!

04:36.978 --> 04:40.313
Yo, where are you going?
The car's this way.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.816
Police! Freeze!

04:41.849 --> 04:42.984
Drop your weap--

04:43.017 --> 04:44.986
Get down! Shit!

04:45.019 --> 04:46.453
Hey, man.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.457
What's all
that cowboy shit, man?
Stick to the plan!

04:50.490 --> 04:51.826
I'm playing to win.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.027
Ah, fuck.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.431
You should've said "Please."

04:58.465 --> 04:59.934
Fuck you, buddy.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.402
No, thanks.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.076
I'll get 'em this time.

05:09.110 --> 05:11.846
On three, you ready?
On three, you move. One...

05:11.879 --> 05:13.346
-Two.
-Three. Go!

05:18.119 --> 05:20.988
-I got one.
-Let's get outta here.

05:21.022 --> 05:23.090
Hey-- Get the fucking car.
Let's go.
What the fuck?

05:23.124 --> 05:24.357
After you.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.032
Knight.

05:34.902 --> 05:35.903
Come on. Let's go!

05:45.046 --> 05:46.047
On your mark!

05:52.186 --> 05:53.888
All right, get in the car.
Let's go!

05:53.921 --> 05:55.355
Let's go! Come on!

06:02.129 --> 06:03.798
Help me, James.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.702
Watch out, watch out!

06:16.143 --> 06:19.412
Knight, help me.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.041
Casey, can we talk about
what happened?

07:20.808 --> 07:23.210
I didn't sign up
to shoot cops, man.

07:24.045 --> 07:26.147
The whole FBI
is probably chasing us by now.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.785
It was us or them.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.654
That cop did his job,
we did ours.

07:33.688 --> 07:36.991
We did it better on the day.
For what? A couple grand?

07:38.159 --> 07:43.097
Uh, six, seven, eight,
minus Winna's cut.
So, that's, uh, 134K.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.465
134?

07:46.233 --> 07:47.802
That make it okay
to shoot cops then?

07:47.835 --> 07:51.772
No, but I mean, it's 134.

07:51.806 --> 07:54.008
Should we
just head to Vegas?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.110
Have a cocktail.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.681
I'm down.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.585
Yo.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.727
So, what in the actual fuck
was that about?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.663
You told me to take care of it,
so I took care of it.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.165
Besides, you're the one
who shot the fucking cop.

08:18.199 --> 08:20.101
Because I was cleaning up
your fucking mess.

08:20.134 --> 08:21.769
You keep
telling yourself that.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.705
You told me to do something,
and I fucking did it.

08:24.739 --> 08:29.076
I mean, that was better
than a fucking Pick 6
on a Sunday fucking afternoon.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.311
That's not the point of it.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.279
Whoa, whoa. What's your point?

08:32.313 --> 08:33.981
You not only
put my life in danger,

08:34.015 --> 08:36.650
you tried to screw over
our fucking teammates.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.886
Do you think I don't have
your fucking back?

08:38.919 --> 08:41.088
Huh?
Is that what you're saying?

08:41.122 --> 08:43.758
You're the one coming to me,
"Oh, my knee is busted.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.760
Oh, shit.
Give me some fucking pills.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.329
Oh, come practice with me
so I can make
a fucking comeback.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.165
Oh, my life is over." Huh?
Who had your fucking back then?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.801
You asked me to go,
and I fucking go.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.236
Fuck you, Casey.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.606
You know I'm not in this
for the money.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.325
- Move, move.
- Coming through.

09:18.359 --> 09:20.227
Everybody,
please get out of the way.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.869
Hey. Yeah, we made it.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.370
Your fuckin' plane was late.

10:08.309 --> 10:11.212
Well, Mercer went off.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.350
Yeah, we'll be at LaGuardia
in four hours.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.986
No, fuck LA.
Oh, fuck Mercer.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.821
I'm never working
with him again.

10:22.423 --> 10:23.791
Bye.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.172
Whoo!

11:14.308 --> 11:17.311
Yeah. All right, I'll get
Mercer's cut to him.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.345
Thank you.

11:18.379 --> 11:21.315
138K. This is Winna's cut.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.449
Hey, Case.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.419
I know the last time,
it went to shit.

11:26.287 --> 11:28.289
But I've been working
on something.

11:28.322 --> 11:30.724
I watch this guy
on YouTube,
super legit.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.160
And guess what?
I copied him.

11:34.228 --> 11:36.297
And I was thinking,
for next time--

11:36.330 --> 11:38.832
The fuck are you
talking about, man?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.000
Hold that thought.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.344
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.079
Easy.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.147
What the--

11:56.518 --> 11:57.751
A fucking pipe bomb?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.526
Get that out of here
right now.

12:04.559 --> 12:06.927
If we need a distraction,
we could use it.

12:06.961 --> 12:09.964
Then we'll have
Homeland Security on your asses
for, like, the end of time.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.165
You built this?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.499
From scratch, bro.

12:12.534 --> 12:14.168
That guy from YouTube,

12:14.201 --> 12:16.103
he could teach a toddler
to make one of these things.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.171
That's terrifying.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.806
Yeah.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
Yeah, it kind of
is terrifying.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.244
Whoa. You want me
to get rid of it?

12:23.277 --> 12:26.413
Yes! Obviously.
I can't even believe
this is a real conversation.

12:26.447 --> 12:31.051
Let's stash it, you know,
for an emergency.

12:31.085 --> 12:33.254
You're both insane.
I'm just thinking ahead.

12:33.287 --> 12:35.889
Like Cap taught me,
right, Case?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
Okay, goodbye.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.197
Come on.
You're a little bit impressed.
Where are you going?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.567
Out.
Sykes.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.569
Wait, wait, wait, Sykes.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.504
I'm having a little
get-together tomorrow night.

12:49.537 --> 12:52.373
Couple of people.
If you wanna come by,
just come by.

12:53.274 --> 12:54.375
Maybe.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.210
Bye.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.079
What's her deal?

13:00.615 --> 13:01.915
Bye, Sykes.

13:01.949 --> 13:02.950
Bye!

13:03.984 --> 13:05.185
She's right, you know?

13:06.220 --> 13:07.821
You are insane.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.357
No, but I love it.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.327
My man.

13:15.563 --> 13:17.364
Now...

13:18.132 --> 13:21.302
How'd you do this?

13:21.335 --> 13:23.070
I'm actually glad you asked.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.481
How do you do that?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.118
Lots of practice.

13:38.152 --> 13:40.854
How can you be
at the wrong place

13:40.888 --> 13:43.324
at the right time
all the time?

13:44.058 --> 13:46.561
These guys were spraying
and praying.

13:46.594 --> 13:49.229
<i>It was 50/50 that they would</i>
<i>have hit you or Fitz.</i>

13:49.263 --> 13:52.099
One day, your luck is going
to run out, cowboy.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.869
I should have done it alone.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.338
He'll pull through.

13:58.472 --> 14:03.110
Listen,
we are outgunned, outpaced.

14:03.143 --> 14:07.281
The only way
to catch this crew
is in the act.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.517
You got a theory?
Yeah.

14:10.484 --> 14:12.953
Those guys are smart,
trained.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.223
I mean, all they stole
is just a bit of cash

14:16.256 --> 14:19.594
and an old deck
of baseball training cards.

14:19.627 --> 14:22.329
Smart people don't rob banks.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.566
Yeah, true that.

14:24.599 --> 14:27.434
This crew is tight.
And they move like a team.

14:27.468 --> 14:29.203
Hmm.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.270
Yeah, but--

14:30.304 --> 14:32.272
Athletes.

14:32.306 --> 14:35.309
<i>The guard said</i>
<i>he got truck stick</i>
<i>trying to escape.</i>

14:36.611 --> 14:38.312
That tracks.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.981
You know,
the rest of the team think

14:41.014 --> 14:43.417
that I'm crazier than you
for thinking like this,

14:43.450 --> 14:44.686
but hear me out.

14:44.719 --> 14:46.387
Those guys
are not from here.

14:47.555 --> 14:51.258
One of the witnesses said
that they speak with
a New York accent.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.426
So?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.596
Have you heard
of phantom planes?

14:54.629 --> 14:56.063
The Phantom?

14:56.096 --> 14:59.400
The one in the purple suit
with the dog?

14:59.433 --> 15:01.969
I'm talking about planes.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.539
Phantom planes.

15:04.572 --> 15:09.042
They fly around the country
with no manifests, no record.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.979
They go from one city
to the next one,
pick up people.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.952
Now, there are a couple of jobs
around the country
that fits the MO.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.055
The Miami Credit Union
two months ago.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.224
The Fenway Currency Exchange.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.728
The Austin crypto hit.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.597
The FAA logs tail numbers.

15:30.532 --> 15:32.966
There was only one plane

15:33.000 --> 15:36.538
that was in the same city
as all those jobs.

15:37.505 --> 15:40.608
The plane is registered
to a New York shell company

15:40.642 --> 15:43.277
that goes by-- by Winna.

15:44.178 --> 15:45.212
Winna?

15:50.785 --> 15:52.453
Shit.
You know him?

15:52.486 --> 15:54.388
Mm-hmm. He's a bookie.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.023
Hmm.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.058
That's not
our jurisdiction.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.628
But I can make a call
and get some information.

16:03.531 --> 16:04.965
Where the fuck you going?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.502
New York.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.504
Fuck.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.159
I want to be
a Paw Patrol officer.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.362
We got no pigs
in this house.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.565
They're not pigs.
They're dogs.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.701
Do pigs have paws?

16:40.735 --> 16:43.538
No, they don't have paws.
They got those, uh...

16:43.571 --> 16:45.807
Babe, what do pigs have?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.542
Hooves?
Hooves! Hooves.

16:47.575 --> 16:49.711
Yeah, they got
those hooves.

16:49.744 --> 16:52.279
What about a Gyptian mummy?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.515
Gyp-- Egyptian.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.015
Come on, say that.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.620
E-gyp-tian.

16:58.653 --> 17:00.120
Egyptian.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.489
Gyptian.
That's close enough.

17:02.524 --> 17:05.760
Okay.
Hey, we'll pick out a costume
once I get back.

17:05.793 --> 17:08.128
All right? Love you.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.164
You got another thing there.
Give me a headbutt.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.332
Love ya.
Love you too.

17:12.366 --> 17:13.568
Bye.

17:13.601 --> 17:15.737
You going on a grocery run?

17:15.770 --> 17:18.071
Oh, let's just get takeout,
yeah?

17:18.105 --> 17:19.774
I read too much grease
is bad for kids.

17:19.807 --> 17:23.310
Okay, groceries it is.
You got cash?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.446
Uh, no.
The foreman owes me a check.
I'm gonna go pick it up.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.516
Where?
Where?

17:28.550 --> 17:30.417
Where are you going?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.687
The site. I'm gonna go
get it at the job site.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.756
The one by Broadway?
Yeah.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.323
The construction job?

17:36.356 --> 17:38.660
Yes. The construction job.

17:38.693 --> 17:40.628
Hmm. That's strange,

17:40.662 --> 17:42.830
'cause there isn't
a construction going on
on that block.

17:42.864 --> 17:44.699
Yeah, it's right by it.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.601
I drove by yesterday,

17:46.634 --> 17:48.736
'cause Clara wanted
to see her dad at work.
Jesus Christ.

17:48.770 --> 17:51.471
I want to know
where the father
of my child is going.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.440
Is that--
Is that so wrong?
I'm working.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.474
On what?

17:54.509 --> 17:56.744
On providing for this family.

17:56.778 --> 17:59.681
Casey, you can't provide
for this family if you're
in a fucking jail cell.

17:59.714 --> 18:02.517
Oh, no. I can't provide
for this family with
a nine-to-five, darling. Okay?

18:02.550 --> 18:03.685
That's not enough. Right?
Hmm.

18:03.718 --> 18:05.185
Look, I'm not asking
for much.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.486
Oh, that's bullshit.

18:06.521 --> 18:07.622
Bullshit?
Bullshit!

18:07.655 --> 18:08.723
- Bullshit?
- Yeah!

18:08.756 --> 18:10.825
You love that old lifestyle.

18:10.858 --> 18:13.260
You married a quarterback
who can't play football anymore.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.563
Okay? Poor woman,
having to slum it
with a has-been.

18:15.597 --> 18:18.800
But this is what you got.
This is the real world, okay?

18:18.833 --> 18:22.135
I bust my ass for you,
and I am here.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.838
You're here?
Yes, I'm here.

18:23.871 --> 18:26.373
You think you're here?
No, you're not fucking here.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.909
Half the time,
you're on pain pills.

18:27.942 --> 18:29.544
You're like
a fucking zombie.

18:30.344 --> 18:31.512
And I-I understand.

18:31.546 --> 18:33.413
I see what you
put your body through,

18:34.949 --> 18:37.785
but you're a fucking
drug addict, Casey.

18:38.686 --> 18:39.787
That's nice.

18:39.821 --> 18:41.188
It's the truth.

18:42.724 --> 18:44.692
Hey, darling. Hey.

18:44.726 --> 18:46.861
Hi, hey. I'm sorry...
Ugh.

18:46.894 --> 18:47.929
It's okay.

18:47.962 --> 18:49.864
...that Daddy's screaming.

18:51.566 --> 18:53.367
Did you ever call
Coach Cogburn back?

18:54.936 --> 18:59.406
Um, no. I'm not working
for $18 an hour. All right?

18:59.439 --> 19:03.544
Then Daddy would have to
work for 90 hours a day--
and that's not possible--

19:03.578 --> 19:05.445
so I could provide for you.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.582
To provide for me?

19:07.615 --> 19:09.249
Yeah. Yeah,
you know what I mean.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.318
You know what I mean.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.620
Yeah, yeah.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.793
Come here, okay?
Hey, I--

19:19.994 --> 19:22.396
I love you. I'm sorry.
I just--

19:22.429 --> 19:23.798
I love you, okay?

19:23.831 --> 19:25.566
No. You love getting
under my skin.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.668
It's true.

19:26.701 --> 19:27.935
Hi!

19:27.969 --> 19:29.336
Hi.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.674
Look, I really just
don't need anything more

19:32.707 --> 19:34.509
than what we have right here.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.413
Okay?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.652
You watch your mama
while I'm gone.
Okay.

19:44.686 --> 19:46.253
Okay?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.889
We'll pick out
some costumes.

19:47.922 --> 19:50.190
We'll pick 'em
when I get back. All right.

19:51.793 --> 19:52.794
Okay.

19:53.895 --> 19:55.763
Go eat your sandwich,
okay?
Okay.

19:55.797 --> 19:56.831
Okay.

21:01.562 --> 21:02.830
How's the knee, sausage?

21:04.565 --> 21:06.634
Uh, it's pretty awful,
but thank you for asking.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.971
You know, I got some Tiger Balm
if you wanna, uh, rub me up.

21:10.004 --> 21:12.673
You'd like that?
Oh, I really, really would.

21:12.707 --> 21:14.041
Hmm.

21:15.977 --> 21:17.377
You know the rules.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.346
Help goes around back, okay?

21:19.379 --> 21:21.414
Your breath, man,
it's disgusting.

21:25.787 --> 21:28.790
Arch your back.
Loosen your grip.

21:29.624 --> 21:32.492
And when you're ready,
just take a swing.

21:32.527 --> 21:33.761
Nice!

21:36.130 --> 21:37.665
So you think you're funny?

21:37.698 --> 21:38.766
Not-- Not really.

21:39.534 --> 21:41.702
Get out of here.
It's business time.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.408
-Yeah, uh, golf?
Not really your sport.
-Oh.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.945
Have you ever considered,
uh, power walking?

21:50.978 --> 21:52.747
Oh, so you are funny.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.749
Brigga, punch him.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.991
-Did you do it yet?
-Now that's out of the way,
tell me all about it.

22:04.025 --> 22:06.027
Um, how'd it go?

22:06.060 --> 22:08.830
Uh...

22:08.863 --> 22:11.398
-It was nothing
but a good time, man.
-Yeah?

22:11.431 --> 22:13.366
Yeah.
Exciting.
You got the money?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.636
I got the money.
Here you go, every cent.

22:16.737 --> 22:17.772
Brigga.

22:19.574 --> 22:21.108
Tell me more. Right?

22:21.142 --> 22:23.611
Show me the dailies,
as they say. Go.

22:23.644 --> 22:26.147
Better than any touchdown.

22:26.180 --> 22:30.051
That's what I'm talking about.
A man who's passionate
about his work.

22:30.084 --> 22:33.054
All right, real talk now.
Coach and the captain.

22:33.621 --> 22:35.422
I did see the fireworks.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.558
Yeah, we got it done.
No.

22:37.592 --> 22:40.862
No, what you got was heat.

22:40.895 --> 22:43.430
The cops want both our heads now
for lighting up that detective.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.099
-Yeah? So what? Who cares?
-So what?

22:45.132 --> 22:47.134
Hazard of the job.
Oh, hazard of the job?

22:47.168 --> 22:50.738
-Yeah, hazard of the job.
You have some rats on the force.
-What of it?

22:50.771 --> 22:53.941
So what's their take?
Anyone ID us?
Not that I heard.

22:55.142 --> 22:56.944
But if you
can stand the heat,

22:58.779 --> 23:00.848
I might have another job
for you.

23:00.882 --> 23:01.949
Yeah.

23:04.752 --> 23:06.687
Come on, take it.

23:14.862 --> 23:16.163
Come on.
Nah.

23:16.197 --> 23:18.199
They say it'll sell
for $1.2 million.

23:18.232 --> 23:20.968
$1.2 million.
That's extraordinary, right?

23:21.002 --> 23:22.870
Think about it.
If you can get that,

23:22.904 --> 23:25.106
that's like 200K each
for you and your crew.

23:26.941 --> 23:27.975
250.

23:28.009 --> 23:29.577
250 times five, do the math.

23:29.610 --> 23:32.079
I should just buy
the thing myself. 220.

23:32.113 --> 23:34.916
I'm not working with Mercer.
Three-man team this time.

23:34.949 --> 23:36.617
It's not my problem.

23:37.551 --> 23:38.986
All right.
All right?

23:39.020 --> 23:40.721
Yeah. Get the money ready.
Get the fuck out of here.

23:40.755 --> 23:41.889
All right.
All right, go.

23:46.027 --> 23:47.595
Bring back the girl.

23:55.169 --> 23:58.606
Yeah, I'm just
finishing up here, and I'll
be home in a little bit.

23:59.206 --> 24:01.474
No, that's okay.
Perfect.

24:02.243 --> 24:03.611
Bye.

24:28.703 --> 24:29.870
Come on.
Not now.

24:29.904 --> 24:31.038
All right.

24:43.818 --> 24:45.152
Hey.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.089
What's up, Dave?
How you doing?

24:50.725 --> 24:52.693
Hey, champ.
What's up, brother?
Hey, man.

24:52.727 --> 24:54.895
What the fuck is this?
What, I can't have a party?

24:54.929 --> 24:57.231
How the fuck does a guy
who got dropped by the Mets

24:57.264 --> 24:59.066
and hauls scrap
at his dad's junkyard

24:59.100 --> 25:00.801
pay for a party
like this, huh?

25:00.835 --> 25:03.771
First rule, right?
Don't flash your fucking cash.

25:03.804 --> 25:06.674
What did you do--
What did you do with your cash?
Thanks for asking.

25:06.707 --> 25:09.076
I'm saving it,
so I can get the fuck out
of this neighborhood

25:09.110 --> 25:10.711
and buy new friends.

25:11.445 --> 25:14.048
Dude, I don't want you
to go to jail.

25:14.081 --> 25:15.950
All right, all right.

25:15.983 --> 25:19.587
But we're here. It's a party.
Enjoy it, man. Have a beer.

25:20.621 --> 25:22.656
You're freaking me out.
Jesus.

25:25.693 --> 25:27.128
Hi, Ms. Kandinsky.

25:28.829 --> 25:29.997
What did Winna say?

25:30.031 --> 25:31.065
Um...

25:32.166 --> 25:34.101
Winna said
we did good work.

25:34.135 --> 25:36.771
And that we maybe have
some heat for the cop thing.

25:36.804 --> 25:40.775
But the cop didn't die,

25:40.808 --> 25:42.977
so, you know,
it should blow over.

25:43.911 --> 25:45.346
That come from his rat?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.815
No. They didn't ID
any of us and they won't

25:47.848 --> 25:50.684
as long as we keep
our mouths shut and
don't throw fucking parties.

25:53.654 --> 25:55.756
Uh, but I got
some good news. Hey.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.859
Hi there.

25:58.893 --> 26:01.362
Uh, Winna's got another gig
lined up for us.
Oh, come on.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.898
I'm in.
Why do you want to keep
working with this guy?

26:03.931 --> 26:06.634
'Cause he's given us
five gigs in five months.

26:06.667 --> 26:10.938
Uh, he's got a jet
to fly us anywhere,
take any heist anytime.

26:10.971 --> 26:13.808
And did I mention the part
that we're getting 220?

26:13.841 --> 26:16.811
Whoa, 220?
220.

26:16.844 --> 26:20.614
What about the fucking cop?
Enough with the fucking cop.
Please, okay?

26:20.648 --> 26:22.149
He didn't die, right?
He's okay.

26:22.183 --> 26:24.085
Gonna get paid.
It's gonna be fine.

26:24.118 --> 26:26.020
Yeah. maybe-- maybe
we did him a favor.

26:26.053 --> 26:28.923
Okay, maybe not a favor, but--

26:28.956 --> 26:30.858
That guy
was doing his job.

26:30.891 --> 26:32.760
So were we, okay?

26:32.793 --> 26:34.962
Suddenly,
you're a bank robber
with a heart of gold?

26:36.664 --> 26:38.699
Casey pulled the trigger,
but we're all still guilty.

26:38.732 --> 26:40.167
Just wanna
let you know that.

26:40.201 --> 26:42.937
You're all fucked.
You're all so fucked.

26:42.970 --> 26:46.040
So go see a priest
and confess.
Just not at my party.

26:46.073 --> 26:48.976
Look, Sykes, if you've just
gone up and grown a conscience,
that's fine.

26:49.009 --> 26:51.278
You can walk.
I'm not gonna stop you.

26:53.314 --> 26:55.082
But I want you.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.722
Shut the fuck up
and just tell me
what the score is.

27:04.425 --> 27:06.760
Check this out.

27:06.794 --> 27:08.696
Oh, come on.

27:08.729 --> 27:10.030
Here.

27:10.064 --> 27:12.066
Oh, shit.

27:12.099 --> 27:14.368
No, we're gonna die.
For real.
Fuck off.

27:16.170 --> 27:17.905
No.
One-of-a-kind
collector's item

27:17.938 --> 27:20.107
that sells
at an auction.

27:20.141 --> 27:23.677
Guys, um,
we do this job, right?

27:23.711 --> 27:26.380
We're gonna have
a nice little deposit
for our pensions.

27:28.716 --> 27:31.285
Come on. I've seen it.
I got it all in my head.

27:31.318 --> 27:33.387
I know all the angles.
We can do this.

27:36.056 --> 27:38.058
I'm gonna pass
unless I have my team.

27:38.959 --> 27:40.394
What about Mercer?

27:40.427 --> 27:42.763
Fuck Mercer, okay?

27:42.796 --> 27:45.900
I got one fucking cowboy
right here.
I don't know about Mercer.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.470
Fine.
I'm in.

27:49.504 --> 27:51.906
Let's go steal
Wayne Gretzky.
Have a salami.

27:51.939 --> 27:53.240
Fuck you.
Fuck off.

27:53.274 --> 27:55.109
You couldn't
afford a heater?

27:58.445 --> 28:02.917
Every move
should improve your position
or hurt the enemy.

28:02.950 --> 28:06.053
This is a battlefield.
And never forget
why you're fighting.

28:07.922 --> 28:09.423
Now, the knight.

28:09.456 --> 28:11.759
The knight
is the most dangerous
piece on the board.

28:12.693 --> 28:15.296
The knight can strike
when you least expect it.

28:17.264 --> 28:20.134
The knight moves in ways
most people won't understand.

28:27.074 --> 28:30.411
Now, what the hell?
How the fuck did you--
Where the fuck is my security?

28:30.444 --> 28:31.845
Where's Brigga?

28:31.879 --> 28:34.014
I hope I'm not, uh,
interrupting.

28:34.048 --> 28:37.151
Detective,
you're a long way from home,
you know that?

28:37.184 --> 28:39.286
-Who are you?
-Sango.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.921
Oh, gesundheit.

28:40.955 --> 28:43.490
Welcome to my humble fortress.

28:43.525 --> 28:46.160
- Nice place for a bookie.
- Thanks.

28:46.193 --> 28:48.362
Yeah, we say if there's
a sport with a winner,

28:48.395 --> 28:50.965
then there's also a loser
that was willing to bet on it.

28:50.998 --> 28:53.367
-We need a word.
-You need a word? I got a word.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.401
"Lawyer."

28:54.435 --> 28:55.936
Lawyer?

28:55.970 --> 28:58.506
I got four more words.
"Speak to my lawyer."

28:58.540 --> 29:01.475
As you can see,
I'm in the middle
of a lesson here.

29:01.509 --> 29:06.548
Do you know who this is?
This is the youngest
chess master in history.

29:06.581 --> 29:08.048
Well, good for him.

29:08.082 --> 29:11.085
Hey, this is my home.
All right?

29:11.118 --> 29:12.186
Show some respect.

29:12.219 --> 29:14.288
I apologize
for these clowns.

29:14.321 --> 29:18.058
Hey, kid,
go learn a real sport.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.362
Sit.

29:24.265 --> 29:26.400
Now, detectives,
talk to me.

29:27.167 --> 29:28.435
What can I do you for?

29:28.469 --> 29:30.838
We know all about you,
Winna.

29:30.871 --> 29:33.307
Kicked out of Goldman Sachs
for insider trading.

29:33.340 --> 29:36.176
Got a sweetheart deal
with the judge.

29:36.210 --> 29:40.080
You were a CI
for the local PD and feds.

29:40.114 --> 29:42.983
Oh, so you found
my Wikipedia page, did you?

29:43.017 --> 29:46.453
And I'm glad to see
the government's finally
hiring guys who can read.

29:46.487 --> 29:50.024
So tell me,
if I turn your pockets
inside out,

29:50.057 --> 29:51.258
what am I going to find?

29:51.292 --> 29:53.360
I don't know.
What will you find?

29:54.461 --> 29:56.964
Perhaps a lawsuit
for breaching
my civil liberties?

29:56.997 --> 29:58.365
Really?
Yeah.

29:58.399 --> 30:00.301
You know a lot of ex-pros.

30:00.334 --> 30:02.002
Make some scratch.

30:02.036 --> 30:03.904
Yep.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.973
I'd like a couple of them
for a messy job.

30:06.006 --> 30:08.342
A messy drug job.

30:08.375 --> 30:11.078
You know anything
about that?
No.

30:11.111 --> 30:12.880
Not to the best
of my recollection.

30:13.515 --> 30:14.815
Think real hard.

30:15.449 --> 30:17.017
And what's in it for me?

30:17.051 --> 30:18.986
Christmas dinner
at my place.

30:19.019 --> 30:20.154
Oh, yeah?

30:21.088 --> 30:22.289
I think I'll pass.

30:22.323 --> 30:25.092
Well, better
than the alternative.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.528
And what's that?

30:26.561 --> 30:28.996
You have dinner at his.

30:31.131 --> 30:32.600
You know,
call ahead next time.

30:32.634 --> 30:35.002
I'll make sure
the gates are locked.

30:35.035 --> 30:39.006
If you're covering for them,
I'll find out.

30:41.108 --> 30:42.876
Now, is that a threat,
Detective?

30:44.978 --> 30:46.914
Got a lot of property here.

30:48.315 --> 30:53.053
Lot of places
to get lost, disappear.

30:55.189 --> 30:56.490
Lot of places.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.494
We're done.

31:01.629 --> 31:02.930
Get out.

31:29.957 --> 31:31.125
Wait here.

31:42.637 --> 31:44.672
What the fuck
are you doing here?

31:45.472 --> 31:46.940
What do you got?

31:49.143 --> 31:50.177
What do I got?

31:52.614 --> 31:54.982
What about
the truck heist?

31:55.015 --> 31:58.285
I don't know anything about it,
but if I did know
something about it...

32:00.254 --> 32:01.422
I would look at Casey Rhodes.

32:01.455 --> 32:03.056
Casey Rhodes?

32:03.090 --> 32:04.626
Yeah, look to him.

32:07.629 --> 32:10.197
Yeah, where can I find him?

32:10.230 --> 32:12.499
I'm not gonna do
your fucking job
for you, buddy.

32:12.534 --> 32:15.335
And I shouldn't have to
explain why this can't
come back to Winna.

32:15.369 --> 32:17.004
<i>Don't forget.</i>

32:17.037 --> 32:18.506
You still owe him.

32:18.540 --> 32:21.308
Is that a fact?

32:22.644 --> 32:25.112
Yeah. It's a fact.

32:25.145 --> 32:27.080
Now get the fuck
outta here.

32:43.798 --> 32:45.265
Yo, you got my stuff?
Yeah.

32:45.299 --> 32:46.333
Yeah.

32:46.366 --> 32:48.202
Any news
on the next one?

32:48.235 --> 32:50.705
Uh, nothing yet.
I'll let you know.

32:54.141 --> 32:56.009
No serial numbers.
Complete virgin.

32:56.811 --> 32:59.547
Not for long.
Yes.

32:59.581 --> 33:01.616
All right. Let's get
the fuck outta here, yeah?
Sure.

33:01.649 --> 33:03.350
Casey Rhodes.

33:05.352 --> 33:07.354
-Give that to--
-I'm not going back
to jail, man.

33:07.387 --> 33:09.223
You're not gonna--
If they had anything on us--

33:09.256 --> 33:10.725
Lose it behind
your fucking back.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.729
Can I help you?

33:14.762 --> 33:16.330
Can I see some ID?

33:18.065 --> 33:20.033
You know,
I think I left it at home.

33:20.067 --> 33:22.336
What about you?
Do you, uh--
Do you have your ID?

33:22.369 --> 33:25.138
Yeah, I think
I left mine at home too.

33:25.172 --> 33:26.373
I know who you are.

33:27.274 --> 33:29.476
Casey Rhodes.
And?

33:29.511 --> 33:31.411
Rookie of the year.

33:32.279 --> 33:34.147
Drafted by the Chargers.

33:34.949 --> 33:36.718
That's a really good memory,
pops.

33:38.085 --> 33:39.721
Numbers are good?

33:39.754 --> 33:41.288
Astronomical.

33:41.321 --> 33:43.156
The next Tom Brady.

33:43.858 --> 33:47.060
Lost a lot of money.
Went bankrupt.

33:47.094 --> 33:48.730
Oh, I've heard about you.

33:48.763 --> 33:51.064
Didn't you get banned
for shaving points?

33:51.098 --> 33:52.534
Yeah, you want
a fuckin' autograph?

33:55.269 --> 33:56.804
Get in the fucking car.
Let's go.

33:57.739 --> 33:59.273
Knight.

34:03.343 --> 34:04.712
<i>Knight, help me.</i>

34:08.716 --> 34:10.417
Yeah, you want
a fuckin' autograph?

34:12.219 --> 34:14.488
Knight, you okay?

34:17.291 --> 34:20.562
I was talking about you,
not to you.

34:20.595 --> 34:23.230
Okay, now we have
a mutual friend. Winna.

34:23.263 --> 34:24.364
Uh, Winna.

34:24.398 --> 34:26.466
Hmm. You guys--
You know Winna?

34:26.501 --> 34:28.268
It's a small world.

34:28.302 --> 34:31.405
Maybe we could
all grab some brunch
or something sometime.

34:31.438 --> 34:33.273
Really nice.

34:33.307 --> 34:35.543
That's real cute.
What's your current address?

34:36.176 --> 34:37.344
Me?

34:37.377 --> 34:39.413
Uh, you got a pen?

34:39.446 --> 34:41.683
Okay. It's, uh,
just on the corner

34:41.716 --> 34:44.418
of, uh, "Speak to my"
and "Fuckin' lawyer."

34:44.451 --> 34:46.453
It's a new suburb.

34:46.486 --> 34:48.856
You're friends
with Winna, obviously.

34:48.890 --> 34:51.258
He must train his dogs
really well.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.760
Woof.

34:52.794 --> 34:56.229
Stay safe out there.
Be seeing you.

34:57.331 --> 34:58.666
You too.

35:19.687 --> 35:20.855
Captain. Captain Shea.

35:21.723 --> 35:23.390
Detective Sango.
Mmm.

35:23.423 --> 35:25.425
Thanks for taking the time.
Where's your partner?

35:25.459 --> 35:26.928
He's not my partner.

35:26.961 --> 35:28.763
What can I do for you,
Detective?

35:28.796 --> 35:31.532
We're here as a gesture
of goodwill.

35:31.566 --> 35:33.801
I was wondering if we
could share information.

35:33.835 --> 35:35.670
You're out
of your jurisdiction.

35:36.904 --> 35:42.309
Captain, we have a cop
who is right now fighting
for his life.

35:43.911 --> 35:47.649
Detective Knight
had some leads regarding
some old friend of his.

35:47.682 --> 35:49.349
Andrew Winna.

35:50.250 --> 35:51.819
Old friend?

35:51.853 --> 35:54.221
Yeah, he might have
been a bookie or CI.

35:54.254 --> 35:56.758
Just an old friend
of Knight.

35:56.791 --> 35:59.326
Does he know him
or "he knew him"?

36:01.294 --> 36:04.264
Knight might be
rough around the edges,

36:04.297 --> 36:05.767
but he's a good cop.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.200
Mm-hmm.

36:07.234 --> 36:08.468
Got anything concrete?

36:09.570 --> 36:12.239
Winna's head of security,
Brigga.

36:12.272 --> 36:14.241
He played football
with Casey Rhodes.

36:14.274 --> 36:15.743
I guess they had
a falling out,

36:15.777 --> 36:18.646
because he implicated Casey
and his crew in the heist.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.882
They cover their tracks
very well.

36:20.915 --> 36:23.551
Hit the target
and disappear like ghosts.

36:23.584 --> 36:25.853
Look, Detective,
I know your captain.

36:25.887 --> 36:28.255
She vouched for you,
but not your partner.

36:28.288 --> 36:29.624
She sent me his file.

36:29.657 --> 36:32.392
It is the opinion
of the department

36:32.426 --> 36:34.662
that if James Knight
wasn't hunting bank robbers,

36:34.696 --> 36:36.496
he'd be robbing banks.

36:37.065 --> 36:38.966
He's a thug with a badge.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.868
If they strike again,
I'll give you clearance.

36:40.902 --> 36:42.837
But stay out of our way.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.639
Welcome to New York,
Detective.

36:44.672 --> 36:48.341
Have fun being a tourist
in my city.
Mmm.

37:02.023 --> 37:04.692
That was in!
Get the fuck out of the way.
That was in!

37:04.726 --> 37:06.861
What are you, blind?
Who the fuck is that ref, huh?

37:06.894 --> 37:09.864
He's a dead man,
that's who he is.

37:09.897 --> 37:13.400
You guys are good
at what you do, all right?
You both work for me now, okay?

37:13.433 --> 37:15.737
25%, your take. No cutting
or I take it out in blood.

37:15.770 --> 37:17.839
I'm kidding,
but not really.

37:19.974 --> 37:21.509
What?

37:21.542 --> 37:23.611
It's Knight.
What the fuck does he want?

37:25.713 --> 37:27.280
Give me that phone.

37:28.448 --> 37:31.284
What the fuck are you doing?

37:31.318 --> 37:33.554
Why are you rolling on me
with that jamoke, huh?

37:33.588 --> 37:35.355
We have an understanding,
Detective.

37:35.388 --> 37:37.625
<i>Stay away, or else.</i>

37:37.658 --> 37:39.426
<i>They got him on life support.</i>

37:39.459 --> 37:42.730
Oh, okay.
Well, hazard of the job.
Send him some flowers.

37:42.764 --> 37:44.397
Who shot him?

37:44.431 --> 37:46.366
<i>How the fuck would I know</i>
<i>who shot some guy</i>

37:46.399 --> 37:47.502
<i>in your dirty little city?</i>

37:47.969 --> 37:49.604
<i>We spoke to him.</i>

37:49.637 --> 37:52.372
Yeah, Casey Rhodes.
And his buddy.

37:54.675 --> 37:56.677
They're both stand-up guys.

37:56.711 --> 37:59.346
We both agreed
not to ask questions that
we don't want answers to.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.516
<i>If I get the evidence</i>
<i>that Rhodes shot Fitz--</i>

38:01.549 --> 38:04.852
Uh-uh. Watch that tone,
Detective.

38:04.886 --> 38:07.755
<i>I could always call IA</i>
<i>and let them know about</i>
<i>our little chat.</i>

38:07.789 --> 38:10.558
<i>We threatening</i>
<i>each other now?</i>
No.

38:10.591 --> 38:13.594
No, we are not.
Now, listen to me.

38:13.628 --> 38:17.565
Back off from Rhodes
and Mercer.

38:17.598 --> 38:19.767
<i>If I find out you had</i>
<i>anything to do with this--</i>

38:19.801 --> 38:22.804
Oh, so much plot
and excitement.

38:22.837 --> 38:24.906
Listen to me.
No more empty threats,
Detective.

38:24.939 --> 38:26.974
I can take you out
whenever I want,

38:27.008 --> 38:29.010
<i>wherever I want, okay?</i>

38:29.043 --> 38:32.046
If you don't believe me,
I'd love to give you
a demonstration.

38:32.079 --> 38:34.015
Fitz is still in the ICU,
right?

38:34.916 --> 38:36.416
One call from me,

38:36.449 --> 38:38.385
I'll have him moved
to the morgue. Bye.

38:54.502 --> 38:55.736
And the good news?

38:55.770 --> 38:58.739
Uh, you're late.

38:58.773 --> 39:02.375
How 'bout getting
a fucking watch?
You find the blueprints?

39:02.409 --> 39:06.647
Yeah. But I did
some digging on those cops
that paid you a visit.

39:08.149 --> 39:09.951
Anything good?

39:09.984 --> 39:14.889
Yeah. So first up,
we have Detective
Godwin Frensaw Sango.

39:14.922 --> 39:17.525
Analyst with the CIA
for seven years.

39:17.558 --> 39:21.095
He settled down in LA,
made detective in a year.

39:21.128 --> 39:23.396
- In a year?
- Yeah.

39:23.430 --> 39:26.667
That's good.
What about the other guy?
The bald guy.

39:27.869 --> 39:28.903
The other bald one?

39:28.936 --> 39:30.671
Uh-huh.

39:30.705 --> 39:32.940
So that's Detective
James Edward Knight.

39:32.974 --> 39:35.009
He served in the marines,
got out after a tour,

39:35.042 --> 39:37.578
met his wife and had a kid.

39:37.612 --> 39:38.646
Guess where.

39:38.679 --> 39:40.447
In the back of his car?

39:40.480 --> 39:42.683
No, dumbass. Newark.

39:44.118 --> 39:47.054
This says here
that he made detective
in two years.

39:47.088 --> 39:49.924
And then here's where it gets,
like, super interesting.

39:49.957 --> 39:53.160
Nine years ago,
Knight is transferred
to Los Angeles.

39:53.194 --> 39:54.896
Why?

39:54.929 --> 39:57.064
This all starts with a guy
named Jerry Leach,

39:57.098 --> 40:00.201
an ex-con who the cops liked
for killing a bank manager
during an armed robbery.

40:00.234 --> 40:02.169
<i>Fast forward a few years later,</i>

40:02.203 --> 40:04.705
IA investigated
Knight's involvement
in an off-duty shooting.

40:04.739 --> 40:06.207
The victim, Jerry Leach.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.042
And who was
the unlucky bank manager?

40:08.075 --> 40:10.611
Knight's old man,
William Knight.

40:10.645 --> 40:13.881
But here's the craziest part.
Guess who the last person
to see Jerry Leach alive was?

40:13.915 --> 40:14.949
- Winna?
- Yeah.

40:14.982 --> 40:16.717
Winna was a CI.

40:16.751 --> 40:18.953
He must have tipped off Knight
to Leach's whereabouts

40:18.986 --> 40:21.088
in exchange
for owning Knight a favor.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.456
Witnesses claimed
they didn't see anything,

40:23.490 --> 40:25.126
the IA always leaning
towards Knight.

40:25.159 --> 40:28.062
They made a deal
to send him out west
just to get rid of him.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.997
Since then,
Knight had caught
some big cases.

40:30.031 --> 40:32.700
But he got divorced
and seems to have
some disciplinary hearing

40:32.733 --> 40:34.467
at least once a year.

40:34.502 --> 40:36.469
Boo-hoo.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.172
I don't think we should
get between these guys,

40:38.205 --> 40:40.741
especially with this Knight guy
wanting Casey's head.

40:42.043 --> 40:45.146
If they had anything on us,
we'd be in cuffs right now,
right?

40:46.814 --> 40:48.115
So we proceed.

40:49.517 --> 40:50.551
Blueprints.

40:50.584 --> 40:52.053
Right.

40:53.921 --> 40:57.858
So the good news is,
there are plenty of exit points.

40:57.892 --> 41:01.128
All right, which means
there's plenty of places
for us to get caught, right?

41:01.162 --> 41:02.964
- Right.
- From the top.

41:03.998 --> 41:06.167
7:07, red carpet ends.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.737
Okay, 7:09, one of us
enters through the lobby,
dressed as a server.

41:09.770 --> 41:13.541
-7:25, the auction begins.
-7:30, we cut the lights.

41:13.574 --> 41:15.776
7:31, the snatch goes down.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.745
7:32, we all meet
at the getaway car.

41:17.778 --> 41:20.715
And by 7:33, we're all dead

41:22.083 --> 41:23.818
or rich as fuck.

41:25.052 --> 41:26.554
Fuck yeah.

41:26.587 --> 41:28.522
Now the last thing
we have to decide,

41:29.657 --> 41:31.491
which one of us
makes the grab?

41:36.230 --> 41:37.631
<i>All right, Mike.</i>

41:37.665 --> 41:38.966
You're first up. Let's go.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.802
All right.

41:41.836 --> 41:43.070
On you.
Here we go.

41:48.242 --> 41:49.844
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

41:56.317 --> 41:57.952
No.

41:57.985 --> 42:01.088
- How was that?
- No, horrible. Again.

42:01.122 --> 42:03.157
Alarm will sound
as soon as you snatch it.

42:03.190 --> 42:05.326
You got 30 seconds
to get to the getaway car.

42:05.359 --> 42:08.329
Well, if this was real surface,
things would be different.

42:08.362 --> 42:10.331
Yeah, no shit.

42:10.364 --> 42:13.034
If you can execute here,
you have no excuse
to screw it up on the day.

42:13.067 --> 42:14.135
All right.
Let's go.

42:23.044 --> 42:24.311
Nice.

42:24.345 --> 42:25.980
Go, go, go, go.

42:35.890 --> 42:37.892
-No.
-Nothing?

42:37.925 --> 42:39.794
No. Not even close.

42:39.827 --> 42:42.063
- All right, move aside. I'm up.
- Come on.

42:44.698 --> 42:45.733
All right, ready?

42:49.003 --> 42:50.838
Go!
Yeah!

42:50.871 --> 42:53.607
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come and get it.

42:53.641 --> 42:55.376
Hit the corner.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

42:55.409 --> 42:57.378
Ow! Ow, fuck!

42:57.411 --> 42:59.013
Go, go, go, go, go.

43:03.150 --> 43:04.218
Ugh.

43:04.251 --> 43:05.286
No. Time.

43:05.319 --> 43:07.388
We gotta get this.
Mike!

43:07.421 --> 43:09.857
Come on!
All right.
Take a breath.

43:10.858 --> 43:11.959
Ready? And go!

43:16.230 --> 43:18.265
Come on, come on,
come on, come.
Go, go, go, go.

43:23.804 --> 43:25.339
Come on.

43:25.372 --> 43:26.874
Time.

43:26.907 --> 43:28.075
Ugh!

43:28.109 --> 43:29.643
How was that?

43:30.311 --> 43:31.378
No.

43:31.412 --> 43:32.947
God.

43:32.980 --> 43:34.248
We gotta get this.

43:37.251 --> 43:38.385
You're up.

43:38.419 --> 43:41.055
Okay.
Thought you'd never ask.

43:41.088 --> 43:42.223
Quickly.

43:47.428 --> 43:48.696
We're fucked.

43:50.331 --> 43:52.199
Ready?
Ready.

43:52.233 --> 43:53.267
Go.

44:08.282 --> 44:10.718
Whoa, whoa. Hopefully...

44:13.387 --> 44:14.855
How'd I do?

44:14.889 --> 44:15.990
How did you do that?

44:16.023 --> 44:18.125
Anticipate the turns.

44:18.159 --> 44:20.227
You're right.
We got too much muscle.

44:20.261 --> 44:21.896
Okay, nobody
ever said that.

44:23.797 --> 44:27.935
-You think you're up for this?
-Yeah. Yeah.

44:28.969 --> 44:30.070
Okay.

44:30.104 --> 44:31.071
All right.
Okay.

44:31.105 --> 44:32.740
Set.

44:32.773 --> 44:34.074
Do it blindfolded.

45:19.853 --> 45:21.322
Our auction
will begin shortly.

45:21.355 --> 45:23.958
Please start to find your way
to your seats.

45:31.832 --> 45:34.168
How do I look?

45:34.201 --> 45:36.437
Like Tom Cruise
wants his mask back.

45:36.470 --> 45:38.038
Let's go with that.
Let's go.

45:49.984 --> 45:52.453
The auction will begin
in two minutes. Two minutes.

45:52.486 --> 45:54.221
Please, everyone,
take your seats.

47:14.101 --> 47:16.538
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Maxwell Wyatt.

47:16.571 --> 47:19.306
Tonight, you may walk home
with a piece of sports history.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.241
Without further ado,
our first item.

47:21.275 --> 47:22.577
1,000, 1,000.

47:22.610 --> 47:24.311
For 10,000.

47:24.345 --> 47:25.879
$10,000.

47:25.913 --> 47:27.414
Do I have $25,000?

47:29.651 --> 47:31.218
Who the fuck is that?

48:00.214 --> 48:01.315
How are we lookin'?

48:01.348 --> 48:03.384
I am fan-fucking-tastic.

48:03.417 --> 48:05.520
Now shut up
and let me do my job.

48:05.553 --> 48:08.021
<i>Copy.</i>
Thank you.

48:08.055 --> 48:09.156
Jesus.

48:10.124 --> 48:12.259
Hey, I was actually
just looking to make some--

48:12.292 --> 48:14.261
Shut your mouth
and turn around.

48:14.294 --> 48:15.530
Hands where I can see 'em.

48:15.563 --> 48:16.598
Okay.

48:18.332 --> 48:20.200
NYPD. You're under arrest.

48:20.234 --> 48:22.035
Yeah, east wing,
we got a party crash--

48:34.081 --> 48:39.219
Rhodes, Mike,
this place is crowded
with undercover cops.

48:40.287 --> 48:42.891
Ah, they're probably just
moonlighting as security, right?

48:43.892 --> 48:47.194
Here for the cash handout
and seafood buffet.

48:47.227 --> 48:48.462
Proceed as planned.

49:10.585 --> 49:12.720
Hey, gorgeous.
Fancy seeing you here.

49:12.754 --> 49:15.690
Can I help you?
Oh, cut the charade.
Nobody can hear us.

49:15.723 --> 49:18.560
So how's the big mission going?
You ready to make
the big swipe, huh?

49:18.593 --> 49:20.427
Okay, use your head.

49:20.461 --> 49:22.029
Someone could ID us later on.

49:22.062 --> 49:24.064
See, that's why
I like you, Sykes.

49:24.097 --> 49:26.233
You're as smart
as you're hot.

49:26.266 --> 49:28.001
How about we find
a little corner somewhere

49:28.035 --> 49:30.370
and we can, uh, you know,
have a little talk?

49:30.404 --> 49:32.439
Okay, we're here
to steal that card.

49:32.473 --> 49:34.509
I know.
And a little action
before the big action

49:34.542 --> 49:36.243
won't hurt nobody, right?

49:36.276 --> 49:40.214
Oh.
Oh, you were dead serious.

49:41.014 --> 49:43.050
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

49:43.083 --> 49:45.219
Okay, real talk.

49:45.252 --> 49:49.089
You're a bourgie,
rich asshole acting like
you have a wild side.

49:49.122 --> 49:52.392
You give Casey some jobs,
so you feel like you're
part of a team,

49:52.426 --> 49:55.563
but I bet you were never
picked for any sports team.

49:55.597 --> 49:58.031
You're nothing more
than just another dick
in a suit

49:58.065 --> 50:00.367
who's never had to work
a day in his life.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.035
Now that
we've cleared that up,

50:02.069 --> 50:04.271
let's keep it
fucking professional

50:04.304 --> 50:06.440
and stay the fuck
out of our way.

50:20.522 --> 50:22.590
Gerald Maywood.

50:22.624 --> 50:25.392
You have a wife and two kids
and live at 506 Oakley Drive
in Monterey Park.

50:25.425 --> 50:28.730
Now, do as I say,
and the guy parked
outside your house

50:28.763 --> 50:31.533
won't turn into the guy
who goes inside your house.

50:33.233 --> 50:35.302
Now, wipe the cameras
for the last hour.

50:37.505 --> 50:38.673
There you go.

50:41.174 --> 50:42.309
Stand up

50:43.778 --> 50:45.445
and walk to that room.

50:45.479 --> 50:47.147
I'm gonna lock you in it.

50:52.754 --> 50:54.589
The centerpiece item
of the evening.

50:54.622 --> 50:56.824
A 1979 Wayne Gretzky
rookie card

50:56.858 --> 50:58.726
from before his time
with the Oilers.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.595
Bidding will start
at $1 million.

51:00.628 --> 51:01.829
Do I have one million?

51:01.863 --> 51:04.131
One million over there.
Do I have 1.1?

51:05.198 --> 51:07.669
1.1, anyone? 1.1.

51:07.702 --> 51:09.704
1.2? 1.2? 1.2.

51:09.737 --> 51:11.639
Do I have 1.5? 1.5.

51:11.673 --> 51:14.341
Do I have 1.8? 1.8? 1.8.

51:14.374 --> 51:17.444
Do I have two?
Two million? Two million.
Two million.

51:17.477 --> 51:19.847
2.1?
Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

51:19.881 --> 51:21.248
2.1?

51:21.281 --> 51:23.618
2.1. 2.1?

51:24.251 --> 51:27.120
2.2? 2.2? 2.2.

51:27.154 --> 51:30.123
Going once, twice, sold.

51:30.157 --> 51:32.292
Well, that was exciting.

51:32.326 --> 51:33.795
Moving to position now.

51:33.828 --> 51:35.429
Okay.

51:35.462 --> 51:38.398
Three, two, one, go.

51:46.473 --> 51:47.809
Everyone, stay calm.

51:55.248 --> 51:56.551
Stop her.

52:01.221 --> 52:02.422
Oop. Shit.

52:03.156 --> 52:04.826
Hey. Hey, stop there.

52:08.896 --> 52:11.599
Get the card. No one can leave
until we search all of them.

52:11.633 --> 52:13.333
Lock down the building.

52:13.367 --> 52:15.469
What the fuck are you doing?

52:24.211 --> 52:26.213
Hey, Sykes, they're coming
down the stairwell.

52:31.385 --> 52:32.620
Ah, shit.

52:43.998 --> 52:46.801
The fuck, Sykes? We good?
We gotta go.

52:46.834 --> 52:48.368
Mike, can you hear her?

52:48.402 --> 52:50.437
<i>Not since she swiped the card.</i>

52:50.470 --> 52:52.974
Sykes? Fuck.

52:53.007 --> 52:54.942
<i>So much for getting out</i>
<i>in 30 seconds.</i>

52:59.379 --> 53:01.248
Shit.

53:01.816 --> 53:02.950
Shit.

53:05.419 --> 53:07.722
Uh, hello.
This is your captain speaking.

53:07.755 --> 53:11.793
<i>I have a very special message</i>
<i>for a very important person.</i>

53:11.826 --> 53:14.494
<i>And that message is:</i>
<i>"Left, right, right, left."</i>

53:16.531 --> 53:18.933
<i>Got my toy in the truck</i>
<i>if we need it, Case.</i>

53:18.966 --> 53:20.935
<i>No fucking way.</i>
<i>She's got this.</i>

53:22.804 --> 53:25.272
Come on. Shit.
Come on, Sykes. Come on.

53:27.642 --> 53:30.310
<i>Case, we gotta leave now.</i>

53:46.861 --> 53:48.428
There she is.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.736
- Freeze.
- Hands up.

54:26.701 --> 54:28.335
Come on. Move.

54:28.368 --> 54:29.537
We gotta go!
Come on!

54:29.570 --> 54:30.705
Let's go!
Yo, where's Sykes?

54:30.738 --> 54:31.873
Come on.

54:33.608 --> 54:35.710
Let's go! Come on!

54:35.743 --> 54:38.079
Let's go, buddy.

54:38.112 --> 54:40.782
We have to get out,
for fuck's sake.

54:43.818 --> 54:45.385
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

54:45.418 --> 54:47.688
We needed Mercer.
Rather him than fucking Sykes!

55:01.269 --> 55:04.071
Case, we have to
go back for her.

55:04.105 --> 55:06.908
It's gonna be okay.
Just stick to the plan.

55:10.678 --> 55:12.079
Here you go.

55:12.647 --> 55:14.515
Come on, come on, come on.

55:37.404 --> 55:38.706
They wiped the counters.

55:38.739 --> 55:40.407
There's fingerprints
everywhere.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.475
This is open and shut.

55:42.510 --> 55:46.446
Yo, check it.
We got fucking Dave Chapelle
and Patrick Stewart over here.

55:46.479 --> 55:49.784
I can't believe the captain's
letting them tag along.

55:49.817 --> 55:52.887
Watch your back. Yep.
There you go.

55:54.522 --> 55:55.857
What was stolen?

55:55.890 --> 55:59.794
Uh, some one-of-a-kind
sport card.

55:59.827 --> 56:01.494
Some shit like that.

56:01.529 --> 56:03.030
Sold at 2.2 million.

56:03.064 --> 56:05.666
The woman we picked up
didn't say a word.

56:06.300 --> 56:07.935
She didn't
have it with her.

56:07.969 --> 56:10.004
It must still be in here.

56:10.037 --> 56:11.539
Officers.

56:12.974 --> 56:14.441
Hey.

56:14.976 --> 56:16.777
I remember you.

56:16.811 --> 56:20.548
-Some night, huh?
-Yeah, walk the scene.

56:21.682 --> 56:23.150
Yeah, see what you see.

56:26.187 --> 56:27.555
I love that guy.

56:28.089 --> 56:29.757
If you're involved,

56:30.258 --> 56:31.893
I won't cover for you.

56:35.596 --> 56:37.565
I was just here
for the auction, sir.

56:37.598 --> 56:38.833
Shut up.

56:40.501 --> 56:42.069
Nice badge.

56:42.937 --> 56:44.005
Thanks.

56:45.472 --> 56:48.910
However, my escort tonight
has already left,

56:48.943 --> 56:51.712
so, uh,
I'm gonna need a new one.

56:52.613 --> 56:53.881
That's where you come in.

56:53.915 --> 56:55.549
So why don't you walk me out?

56:57.852 --> 56:58.953
No.

57:00.054 --> 57:01.956
No?
No.

57:01.989 --> 57:04.926
You ain't the only friend
I got in the department.

57:04.959 --> 57:07.628
So, tell you what.
You do this for me, and, uh--

57:07.662 --> 57:08.696
Fuck off.

57:08.729 --> 57:11.032
Oh, "fuck off."

57:11.065 --> 57:12.566
Yeah.
That's a no too, right?

57:14.268 --> 57:16.037
Walk me through that line,
Detective.

57:16.070 --> 57:18.072
I said no.
No.

57:18.105 --> 57:20.207
You don't get to say no.

57:20.241 --> 57:22.576
You seem to have forgotten
a phone call we had earlier,

57:22.610 --> 57:23.911
so let me remind you.

57:24.946 --> 57:27.949
<i>Fitz, God bless him, is alive,</i>

57:27.982 --> 57:29.884
<i>but only as long as I allow.</i>

57:31.085 --> 57:33.220
<i>You shouldn't have come back,</i>
<i>Detective.</i>

57:33.254 --> 57:36.123
<i>But since you're here,</i>
<i>I'm calling in that favor.</i>

57:42.897 --> 57:44.632
Now walk.

57:47.835 --> 57:49.637
Let's go.

57:52.239 --> 57:53.708
He's clear.

57:55.109 --> 57:56.744
After you.

58:12.693 --> 58:14.028
What the hell
just happened here?

58:14.061 --> 58:15.529
Did you search him?

58:15.563 --> 58:17.665
S-So you just let him go?
Just like that?

58:17.698 --> 58:19.000
You know what?

58:19.867 --> 58:21.802
Something is going on there.

58:21.836 --> 58:23.971
-He's got something on you.
-On me?

58:24.005 --> 58:26.607
You're a fucking disgrace now.
You don't deserve this badge.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.209
I'm going to report you.

58:51.632 --> 58:52.800
You're fine.

58:58.105 --> 59:00.741
Fuck, man.
We gotta go back and get her.

59:01.742 --> 59:03.344
I'm gonna call Winna.
Okay?

59:03.377 --> 59:05.312
He's got cops in his pockets.
He'll know what to do.

59:05.346 --> 59:07.815
Winna only cares about himself.
He doesn't give a fuck about us.

59:07.848 --> 59:10.951
Exactly.
What's good for us
is good for everybody.

59:10.985 --> 59:14.789
Sykes isn't gonna give us up.
Hey, you know that. Right?

59:14.822 --> 59:17.792
It's in everybody's
best interest
to get her free.

59:17.825 --> 59:21.228
Now, flip the plates,
burn everything, stick
to the fucking plan, baby.

59:21.262 --> 59:22.863
Let's go. You got it.

59:28.302 --> 59:31.038
<i>- Hey, Casey, my friend.</i>
<i>- How you doing?</i>

59:31.072 --> 59:33.174
Hey, before you say anything,
no, okay?

59:33.207 --> 59:34.742
Sykes isn't gonna give us up.

59:34.775 --> 59:36.844
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

59:36.877 --> 59:38.345
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

59:38.379 --> 59:40.781
<i>It means I got people</i>
<i>in the system.</i>
Yeah.

59:40.815 --> 59:43.918
<i>Don't ask.</i>
<i>If you think she's gonna</i>
<i>be a problem, just say so.</i>

59:43.951 --> 59:45.352
<i>I can make it so she ain't.</i>

59:46.120 --> 59:48.856
No, no, okay?
She's part of the team.

59:48.889 --> 59:50.758
<i>Look, okay, I get it.</i>
<i>You're right. Fine.</i>

59:50.791 --> 59:52.359
<i>Just forget anything I said,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

59:52.393 --> 59:55.729
<i>Listen, good news,</i>
<i>we got the card.</i>

59:55.763 --> 59:58.732
<i>But bad news is, well,</i>
<i>Sykes handed it off to me,</i>

59:58.766 --> 1:00:00.801
<i>which was smart in the moment.</i>

1:00:00.835 --> 1:00:03.637
<i>But to get out myself,</i>
<i>I kind of had to pass it</i>
<i>off to a cop.</i>

1:00:03.671 --> 1:00:05.840
<i>And now, I have no idea</i>
<i>where this cop is.</i>

1:00:05.873 --> 1:00:08.843
<i>But don't worry about that.</i>
<i>All is well.</i>
<i>All will be well.</i>

1:00:08.876 --> 1:00:11.312
<i>We'll just track him down</i>
<i>and we'll get the card.</i>

1:00:11.345 --> 1:00:13.013
Hello?

1:00:13.047 --> 1:00:15.082
<i>We are going to be rich,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

1:00:15.116 --> 1:00:18.419
<i>I told you, I got your back.</i>
<i>You have nothing to worry about.</i>

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:21.856
<i>Life is good.</i>
<i>We're on top of the world.</i>
<i>I will speak to you soon.</i>

1:00:22.356 --> 1:00:23.390
Hello?

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:28.329
All right. Sounds good.

1:00:31.132 --> 1:00:32.166
Ho!

1:00:34.401 --> 1:00:35.636
Hey, Mike!

1:00:41.842 --> 1:00:42.910
Whoo!

1:00:45.746 --> 1:00:47.448
Yo, Mike.

1:00:47.481 --> 1:00:48.716
What the fuck is that?

1:00:52.486 --> 1:00:53.888
Case!

1:00:54.955 --> 1:00:55.890
Fuck!

1:01:17.077 --> 1:01:18.078
Fuck.

1:01:34.295 --> 1:01:35.763
Uh-uh.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.294
Die!

1:02:34.455 --> 1:02:38.092
Okay, you're out of ammo.
This should be some fun.

1:02:44.599 --> 1:02:45.966
Hey, Mike!

1:02:47.234 --> 1:02:49.370
Mike!

1:02:52.973 --> 1:02:54.241
You all right, buddy?

1:02:56.511 --> 1:02:59.346
You fucking piece of shit.

1:03:02.950 --> 1:03:04.151
Yo, I know this guy.

1:03:06.854 --> 1:03:08.355
He's security for Winna.

1:03:10.157 --> 1:03:11.225
Yo, Mikey?

1:03:16.330 --> 1:03:17.364
You okay?

1:03:18.165 --> 1:03:20.100
I'll get you to the hospital,
all right?

1:03:20.134 --> 1:03:21.368
Okay, Mikey, look.

1:03:22.637 --> 1:03:24.004
Hey, Mikey.

1:03:24.639 --> 1:03:26.373
Hey, Mike! Mike!

1:03:27.107 --> 1:03:29.009
Hey, buddy, you're okay.
You're okay.

1:03:29.043 --> 1:03:32.079
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
You're all right, buddy.

1:03:32.112 --> 1:03:35.583
We're gonna
get you to the hospital.
You're gonna be all right.

1:03:35.617 --> 1:03:37.084
Hey, Mikey.

1:03:37.619 --> 1:03:40.220
Oh, fuck. Mike!

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:35.309
<i>You think you're here?</i>

1:04:46.353 --> 1:04:48.322
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

1:04:49.657 --> 1:04:50.692
Hi.

1:04:50.725 --> 1:04:53.360
Hey, baby.
<i>Hi. Hi.</i>

1:04:53.394 --> 1:04:56.631
Lily, I need you
to leave the house,
get Clara and get to a hotel.

1:04:56.664 --> 1:04:58.566
<i>What? What is-- What--</i>

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.968
<i>Casey, what are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>
Something fucked-up happened.

1:05:01.001 --> 1:05:03.170
<i>What did you do?</i>
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:05.339
Hey, I need you
to leave the house
right now, okay?

1:05:05.372 --> 1:05:07.474
<i>What did you do, Casey?</i>
I don't have time to explain.

1:05:07.509 --> 1:05:09.376
Just leave the house.
<i>Jesus! I can't believe it.</i>

1:05:09.410 --> 1:05:11.311
<i>Did you hurt someone?</i>
No, it's not that.

1:05:11.345 --> 1:05:14.682
Leave the house, Lily! Go!

1:05:15.683 --> 1:05:17.050
Hell--

1:05:19.453 --> 1:05:20.588
God!

1:05:21.321 --> 1:05:23.390
Fuck. Fuck.

1:05:31.064 --> 1:05:32.634
Mercer.

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:36.203
It's Rhodes. I need to meet.

1:05:41.509 --> 1:05:42.943
We need to talk.

1:05:54.789 --> 1:05:57.991
So, from the top.
Is Knight dirty?

1:05:58.025 --> 1:06:00.194
I don't know. Maybe.

1:06:00.227 --> 1:06:03.230
We think Winna's involved
in these heists?

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:05.600
Well, it's not a coincidence
that he was there.

1:06:08.101 --> 1:06:10.505
How many cases has Knight
tanked for Winna?

1:06:13.073 --> 1:06:14.676
Honestly, none.

1:06:16.477 --> 1:06:18.580
I think it was
just a case of

1:06:18.613 --> 1:06:20.782
"Looking the other way"
situation, you know?

1:06:20.815 --> 1:06:24.719
But Knight doesn't let
anything slide, ever.

1:06:24.752 --> 1:06:26.487
He's too proud.

1:06:31.291 --> 1:06:32.326
Fitzgerald.

1:06:32.794 --> 1:06:34.027
Who?

1:06:35.496 --> 1:06:38.633
His partner. The one
who got shot by Rhodes.

1:06:39.667 --> 1:06:42.604
Bet you Winna
threatened his life.

1:06:42.637 --> 1:06:44.304
That explains it.

1:06:44.338 --> 1:06:46.641
A bad guy said
he'd hurt his friend?

1:06:46.674 --> 1:06:48.543
He is a cop.

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:51.278
He knows better
than to let a perp leave
the scene of a heist.

1:06:51.311 --> 1:06:53.213
And not just any perp.

1:06:53.247 --> 1:06:57.417
FBI, CIA, ATF
all have open cases on Winna.

1:06:57.451 --> 1:06:59.721
He's a slimy, rich
asshole bastard.

1:06:59.754 --> 1:07:03.056
He's been sliding out of
each and every investigation,
throwing his money around.

1:07:03.090 --> 1:07:05.560
He is the cause
of what's wrong
with this city.

1:07:05.593 --> 1:07:09.631
He even used to be a CI
and played the force
to eliminate his rivals.

1:07:09.664 --> 1:07:11.365
You think we don't know
about Winna?

1:07:11.398 --> 1:07:13.066
We have been on his ass
for years!

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:15.469
And two city cops from LA
walk in here

1:07:15.503 --> 1:07:17.237
and think they're
gonna handle this shit,

1:07:17.271 --> 1:07:19.239
fuckin' up
the whole entire case?

1:07:20.508 --> 1:07:22.577
The woman, she said something?

1:07:23.711 --> 1:07:25.680
Not a word.
Listen.

1:07:27.615 --> 1:07:30.083
I can get her to speak.
Give me five minutes.

1:07:30.117 --> 1:07:32.820
Be lucky you are not
in the cell next to her.

1:07:32.854 --> 1:07:36.390
Knight goes anywhere
near this case or Winna,

1:07:36.423 --> 1:07:38.292
I will have him
in a cell so long

1:07:38.325 --> 1:07:40.160
it will rot
his fucking head off.

1:07:42.564 --> 1:07:43.698
Get out of my office.

1:08:09.524 --> 1:08:12.359
<i>You're a fucking disgrace now.</i>
<i>You don't deserve this badge.</i>

1:08:13.828 --> 1:08:17.431
<i>Something is going on there.</i>
<i>He's got something on you.</i>

1:09:53.995 --> 1:09:56.631
<i>Hey, it's your favorite CI</i>
<i>Winna.</i>

1:09:56.664 --> 1:09:59.433
<i>Just letting you know,</i>
<i>Leach will be coming by</i>
<i>any second.</i>

1:09:59.466 --> 1:10:02.637
<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>don't forget, Detective,</i>
<i>you owe me.</i>

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.836
<i>How's my favorite detective?</i>

1:10:34.869 --> 1:10:36.671
Yeah, what's it to you?

1:10:36.704 --> 1:10:39.439
Oh, let's meet.

1:10:39.473 --> 1:10:41.542
I think we should meet.

1:11:34.061 --> 1:11:35.563
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Hi, Casey.</i>

1:11:35.596 --> 1:11:36.898
You guys at the hotel?

1:11:37.632 --> 1:11:39.734
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1:11:39.767 --> 1:11:41.836
What do you mean?
<i>We're not at the hotel.</i>

1:11:41.869 --> 1:11:44.939
No, no, no, no.
Hey, no. No. I need you--
I need you to trust me.

1:11:44.972 --> 1:11:46.941
<i>This is insane.</i>
Baby, I need you to trust me.

1:11:46.974 --> 1:11:49.977
I need you to get your shit,
get Clara and get
to a hotel right now.

1:11:50.011 --> 1:11:51.913
<i>No, I don't want to do that.</i>
No!

1:11:51.946 --> 1:11:54.015
<i>You're being paranoid.</i>
No, I'm not. I promise you.

1:11:54.048 --> 1:11:56.449
<i>You are being paranoid.</i>
I'm not being paranoid, okay?

1:11:56.483 --> 1:11:58.853
- People are after me.
- You're not safe.

1:11:58.886 --> 1:12:02.123
You're not safe.
<i>Well, I feel safe. And I don't--</i>
<i>I'm over this. I'm done.</i>

1:12:02.156 --> 1:12:03.891
You-- Fuck.

1:12:11.732 --> 1:12:13.000
Oh, fuck.

1:12:17.972 --> 1:12:19.607
Oh, fuck.

1:12:27.081 --> 1:12:28.616
Ah, fuck.

1:12:28.649 --> 1:12:31.018
Fuck.

1:12:37.859 --> 1:12:39.894
They shot Mike.

1:12:39.927 --> 1:12:43.430
And Sykes is
locked up somewhere, man.
It's absolutely fucked.

1:12:44.464 --> 1:12:46.567
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1:12:47.467 --> 1:12:48.502
Hmm?

1:12:49.170 --> 1:12:51.404
Can you try to have a heart?

1:12:51.438 --> 1:12:52.974
I'm here, aren't I?

1:12:53.007 --> 1:12:54.942
I mean, there,
that's some good news.

1:12:56.043 --> 1:12:58.980
Man, you've always had
a fucked-up definition
of good.

1:13:02.449 --> 1:13:04.719
Man, if you're feeling
the heat, get--

1:13:04.752 --> 1:13:06.187
You know, go to Mexico
or something.

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.189
Mexico, and then what?

1:13:08.222 --> 1:13:09.790
Well, live.

1:13:09.824 --> 1:13:11.959
Be free.
Not go to fucking jail.

1:13:12.693 --> 1:13:15.162
Winna tried
to wipe me out, man.

1:13:20.201 --> 1:13:21.602
You have anything on you?

1:13:22.970 --> 1:13:24.505
Jesus, man.

1:13:25.606 --> 1:13:27.808
Just slow down, buddy.

1:13:38.485 --> 1:13:40.453
Do you feel better?

1:13:40.487 --> 1:13:41.522
Okay.

1:13:42.723 --> 1:13:44.892
All right, so what's the play?

1:13:47.929 --> 1:13:50.932
Well, Winna's not gonna stop
until I'm dead.

1:13:51.966 --> 1:13:53.901
Probably.

1:13:53.935 --> 1:13:56.469
So I gotta figure out a way
to get close to him.

1:13:57.638 --> 1:13:58.906
And then what?

1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:00.541
The fuck you think?

1:14:01.409 --> 1:14:04.078
No, come on, bro.
You're not a fucking killer.

1:14:04.111 --> 1:14:07.014
You've been
a grumpy little bitch
ever since you shot that cop.

1:14:07.048 --> 1:14:08.215
Man, fuck you.

1:14:10.551 --> 1:14:12.954
Man, you're talking
about premeditated murder.

1:14:13.754 --> 1:14:17.124
Not this fluffy little
self-defense shit.

1:14:17.158 --> 1:14:20.227
You got to walk up to him,
put a gun to his fucking head

1:14:20.261 --> 1:14:21.796
and pull the trigger.

1:14:23.130 --> 1:14:25.099
Come on, Casey,
you're not that guy.

1:14:31.072 --> 1:14:32.974
I know how we can get
close to him.

1:14:35.710 --> 1:14:38.212
The card is
in a cop's desk, right?

1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.082
So, we sneak into--

1:14:43.184 --> 1:14:44.819
Sneak--

1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.556
We just gotta sneak
into a police station.

1:14:50.057 --> 1:14:51.192
Fuck, right.

1:14:53.094 --> 1:14:54.929
No, no, no, no, no.

1:14:55.563 --> 1:14:56.964
One of us can.

1:14:56.998 --> 1:15:00.067
One of us can. Okay?

1:15:00.101 --> 1:15:02.603
Just like a fucking
football play, brother.

1:15:02.636 --> 1:15:04.605
I fucking fake left,
you go right.

1:15:06.874 --> 1:15:11.078
You say I do,
I'll fucking do it.

1:15:11.112 --> 1:15:14.815
Dude, I can't let you--
I can't ask you to do that.
I mean, come on.

1:15:14.849 --> 1:15:17.084
I'll create a diversion,
get the cops to follow me.

1:15:17.118 --> 1:15:19.620
All you gotta do is find
a way to get in there.

1:15:19.653 --> 1:15:21.622
And guess what, baby?
It's fucking Halloween.

1:15:23.124 --> 1:15:24.725
It is Halloween.

1:15:25.860 --> 1:15:28.562
One time a year
you can wear a mask
anywhere you want.

1:15:30.197 --> 1:15:31.265
No...

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:34.535
Get creative.

1:15:36.103 --> 1:15:37.938
It'd be fun.

1:16:29.323 --> 1:16:30.891
Hey!

1:16:32.359 --> 1:16:33.594
What's up?

1:16:34.028 --> 1:16:35.229
Jesus Christ.

1:16:36.197 --> 1:16:39.133
How are those
Scots-Irish genes
treating you now?

1:16:40.868 --> 1:16:44.038
Worse than the English.
Yeah.

1:16:44.071 --> 1:16:46.073
You woke me up.

1:16:48.342 --> 1:16:50.211
All right, come on, pal.

1:16:52.413 --> 1:16:54.615
It's still raining,
isn't it?

1:17:00.754 --> 1:17:04.158
I'm losing my mind
trying to figure this out.

1:17:04.959 --> 1:17:06.060
Nikki Sykes.

1:17:06.794 --> 1:17:08.262
Ex-Olympic gymnast.

1:17:09.063 --> 1:17:11.031
Finished fourth at Rio.

1:17:11.065 --> 1:17:14.201
And then
she got banned for life
from the sport.

1:17:14.235 --> 1:17:15.669
For coming in fourth?

1:17:15.703 --> 1:17:17.238
No.

1:17:17.271 --> 1:17:20.207
For selling medical records
of her fellow Olympians.

1:17:20.241 --> 1:17:22.209
They couldn't prove it.

1:17:22.243 --> 1:17:25.279
Apparently,
the buyer is a guy
who allegedly worked for--

1:17:25.312 --> 1:17:26.847
Let me guess.

1:17:27.882 --> 1:17:29.350
Winna.

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:31.252
That's right.
Mm-hmm.

1:17:31.285 --> 1:17:33.988
Sykes hasn't said a word.

1:17:34.021 --> 1:17:37.992
But these days,
the metadata on phones
do all the talking.

1:17:38.025 --> 1:17:44.131
So I got a buddy of mine at NSA,
you know, to QTap her phone.

1:17:44.165 --> 1:17:46.066
Just to see what kind
of cluster of friends

1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:48.669
she's chatting with
consistently.

1:17:49.170 --> 1:17:50.337
Who else?

1:17:50.371 --> 1:17:52.239
Mike Rochester.

1:17:52.273 --> 1:17:55.009
Went to the same college
as Rhodes
and got drafted by the Mets.

1:17:55.042 --> 1:17:56.343
Mm-hmm.

1:17:56.377 --> 1:17:58.145
And then only played
for one year, because...

1:17:58.179 --> 1:18:01.282
Mm-hmm.
...he was partying too much.
They cut him.

1:18:02.750 --> 1:18:04.818
Well, he's dead now.

1:18:04.852 --> 1:18:09.456
They found his body
in his uncle's junkyard.
Oh.

1:18:09.490 --> 1:18:12.860
I guess Rhodes wanted
one less share to go around.

1:18:12.893 --> 1:18:14.228
Yeah, that doesn't track.

1:18:20.100 --> 1:18:22.169
They're not gonna
leave anybody behind.

1:18:23.804 --> 1:18:25.072
What if it was Winna?

1:18:26.140 --> 1:18:27.841
He knows heat
is coming his way,

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:31.178
so he tried to merc them,
but screws the hit.

1:18:33.314 --> 1:18:37.384
He-He knows that Mercer
and Rhodes won't go quietly.

1:18:38.819 --> 1:18:40.788
Odds are pretty good.

1:18:40.821 --> 1:18:43.390
I mean, they'll choose death
before they go to prison.

1:18:43.424 --> 1:18:46.160
Mm-hmm.
I think it's a bet
that Winna will take.

1:18:46.827 --> 1:18:49.964
Has the card turned up?
No.

1:18:49.997 --> 1:18:51.533
What about the DA?

1:18:51.566 --> 1:18:54.201
Can you tie them
to the robberies?

1:18:54.235 --> 1:18:56.136
The security guard
from the arena,

1:18:56.170 --> 1:18:58.339
he thinks he can ID
Rhode's voice.

1:18:58.372 --> 1:19:00.007
Circumstantial.

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:01.543
Nah, come on, man.

1:19:01.576 --> 1:19:03.143
No witnesses.

1:19:03.177 --> 1:19:05.846
Come on. Everyone
can see that it's them.

1:19:05.879 --> 1:19:07.481
Rhodes executed both jobs

1:19:07.515 --> 1:19:12.453
like it was straight
out of Belichick's playbook.

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:14.188
Why don't you call Bill up?

1:19:15.590 --> 1:19:17.024
Maybe he's moonlighting.

1:19:17.057 --> 1:19:19.059
Come on, don't be pithy.

1:19:19.093 --> 1:19:21.195
You don't have
a shred of evidence.

1:19:21.228 --> 1:19:24.832
These guys made a living
fighting over a pigskin.

1:19:24.865 --> 1:19:26.233
I mean,
it's not a big stretch

1:19:26.267 --> 1:19:28.302
from being
an ex-football player...
Mm-hmm.

1:19:28.335 --> 1:19:31.105
...to becoming a bank robber.
Mm-hmm.

1:19:32.339 --> 1:19:33.974
This was fun.

1:19:34.008 --> 1:19:36.377
That's it?

1:19:39.614 --> 1:19:43.183
You know,
I was thinking.

1:19:45.286 --> 1:19:47.054
What if we try your way?

1:19:47.087 --> 1:19:49.390
You know, like,
we go old school on them.

1:19:49.423 --> 1:19:52.359
Just try to shake a few cages
and see what falls out.

1:19:53.227 --> 1:19:54.461
Are you wearing a wire?

1:19:54.495 --> 1:19:56.363
Come on,
you must be kidding.

1:19:56.397 --> 1:19:58.365
Do you have something
on you now?

1:19:58.399 --> 1:20:03.137
I just want to close
this book on these fuckers
and just go back home.

1:20:03.170 --> 1:20:04.204
I hate New York.

1:20:05.072 --> 1:20:06.307
No, I don't.

1:20:07.308 --> 1:20:09.310
Well, I do.

1:20:12.547 --> 1:20:15.583
They can get to Fitz
anytime.

1:20:15.617 --> 1:20:17.418
I can't run that risk.

1:20:19.453 --> 1:20:21.455
If Fitz was in your shoes,

1:20:21.488 --> 1:20:26.026
wouldn't you want him
doing everything in his power
to stop Winna?

1:21:12.072 --> 1:21:13.907
Oh, no!
No, no, no!

1:21:13.941 --> 1:21:17.211
- All right, everybody stay
on the fucking ground.

1:21:17.244 --> 1:21:20.280
We're gonna
make this real quick.
It's a bank robbery.

1:21:20.314 --> 1:21:23.484
As you probably know,
load this fucking bag right now!

1:21:23.518 --> 1:21:25.486
You! All against
the fucking wall.

1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:28.590
Pull out your phones
and dial 911!

1:21:28.623 --> 1:21:32.527
Okay. Now you call and say
to the New York police,

1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:35.663
"Hello, we are being robbed
by the big, bad wolf.

1:21:35.697 --> 1:21:38.098
And we're scared,
scared little piggies!"

1:21:38.132 --> 1:21:41.368
You're gonna dial it!
Dial 911!

1:21:41.402 --> 1:21:43.103
Thank you.

1:21:43.137 --> 1:21:48.208
Send everybody who can,
every fucking piggy in the NYPD,

1:21:48.242 --> 1:21:50.110
you send my fucking way.

1:21:52.614 --> 1:21:54.281
211 in progress.

1:22:00.588 --> 1:22:02.289
<i>What don't we try your way?</i>

1:22:02.322 --> 1:22:06.493
<i>He knows that Mercer</i>
<i>and Rhodes won't go quietly.</i>

1:22:06.528 --> 1:22:07.562
Nice badge.

1:22:08.763 --> 1:22:10.565
<i>I think we should meet.</i>

1:22:12.534 --> 1:22:16.704
And thank you very much.
You're very fast.
Very efficient!

1:22:16.738 --> 1:22:20.642
Okay, thank you very much!
Happy Halloween!

1:22:20.675 --> 1:22:23.110
And have a wonderful,
wonderful day.

1:22:23.143 --> 1:22:25.179
Don't stay up
too late, piggies.

1:22:27.615 --> 1:22:29.283
There he is!

1:22:42.162 --> 1:22:44.064
Hold back, hold back.

1:22:44.097 --> 1:22:45.567
Pull back! Pull back!

1:23:10.057 --> 1:23:11.425
We have you surrounded.

1:23:11.458 --> 1:23:14.161
Drop your weapon.
Come out with your hands up.

1:23:26.406 --> 1:23:28.308
Shit! Stay down, stay down!

1:23:58.372 --> 1:24:00.274
Where's your partner?

1:24:00.307 --> 1:24:02.442
Shoot me.

1:24:02.476 --> 1:24:04.646
- Where is Rhodes?
- Shoot me.

1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:08.415
Do it. Do it!

1:24:09.884 --> 1:24:11.218
You pussy.

1:24:24.866 --> 1:24:27.467
To all units,

1:24:27.502 --> 1:24:30.470
be on the lookout
for one Casey Rhodes.

1:24:30.505 --> 1:24:33.307
Male, Caucasian, in his 30s.

1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:35.610
He's armed and dangerous.

1:25:19.252 --> 1:25:21.556
Hi, I'm here
to pick up the, uh--

1:25:21.589 --> 1:25:23.457
Whatever. Go on in.

1:25:57.792 --> 1:26:00.260
I can't see in this thing.

1:26:08.002 --> 1:26:09.469
Good to see you.

1:26:09.504 --> 1:26:11.271
You looking for something?
Ah, fuck!

1:26:43.705 --> 1:26:45.773
Hop in.
Are you, uh,
trying to be funny?

1:26:45.807 --> 1:26:47.742
No, not at all.

1:27:16.504 --> 1:27:17.839
Where are we going?

1:27:21.374 --> 1:27:23.911
Where are we going?

1:27:28.750 --> 1:27:33.353
What, are you gonna
drive me somewhere
and shoot me in the head?

1:27:33.386 --> 1:27:35.957
What kind of cop are y--

1:27:40.528 --> 1:27:42.429
Oh, fuck!

1:27:45.967 --> 1:27:49.302
Uh...

1:27:51.438 --> 1:27:53.808
They treat you like royalty.

1:27:55.009 --> 1:27:57.578
Did you know that, Knight?

1:27:57.612 --> 1:27:59.814
You know that.
You get the money, the fame.

1:27:59.847 --> 1:28:01.414
The women.

1:28:01.448 --> 1:28:03.551
And then the moment
you think you deserve it...

1:28:04.786 --> 1:28:06.053
...boom, they take it away.

1:28:06.087 --> 1:28:07.855
And all those people
you thought loved you,

1:28:07.889 --> 1:28:09.690
they disappear too,

1:28:09.724 --> 1:28:12.760
until all you're left with
is migraines and a fucked knee!

1:28:17.565 --> 1:28:20.535
And a confused family
who just wants the old you back.

1:28:23.571 --> 1:28:25.540
I just want it to end.

1:28:29.877 --> 1:28:31.712
I mean, you get it, don't you?

1:28:35.683 --> 1:28:38.519
You're always trying
to be normal.

1:28:39.153 --> 1:28:40.621
But you're not normal.

1:28:40.655 --> 1:28:42.355
You don't even know
what normal is,

1:28:42.389 --> 1:28:44.792
so you-- you do
what they trained you to do.

1:28:44.826 --> 1:28:47.094
You-- You--
You keep moving.

1:28:47.128 --> 1:28:49.130
<i>You go faster. You jump higher.</i>

1:28:49.163 --> 1:28:50.898
<i>You hit harder.</i>

1:28:50.932 --> 1:28:52.767
Always chasing.

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:54.101
Winna knew that!

1:28:56.737 --> 1:28:58.973
Are you even listening to me?

1:28:59.006 --> 1:29:00.808
Are you listening to me?

1:29:03.678 --> 1:29:05.713
They threatened my family.

1:29:08.950 --> 1:29:11.118
Winna's gonna send Brigga
after them.

1:29:11.986 --> 1:29:15.656
And I know-- I know if I--
if I have this card,

1:29:15.690 --> 1:29:16.991
I can get close to him.

1:29:17.024 --> 1:29:18.860
And if I can get close to him,

1:29:18.893 --> 1:29:22.395
I-- I can make sure
that he never hurts anybody
ever again.

1:29:26.499 --> 1:29:29.904
I don't want my daughter
to grow up without her father.

1:29:32.573 --> 1:29:33.674
I mean, she's--

1:29:33.708 --> 1:29:35.743
She's my-- She's my world.

1:29:37.444 --> 1:29:39.080
And I did all of this for her.

1:29:44.451 --> 1:29:46.486
I mean,
that's not completely true.

1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:48.522
I mean,
I did a lot of it for me.

1:29:48.556 --> 1:29:50.490
I did a lot of it for me, man.

1:29:51.158 --> 1:29:52.492
I just--

1:29:53.527 --> 1:29:55.162
Fuck.

1:29:55.196 --> 1:29:56.964
You fucking idiot.

1:30:02.503 --> 1:30:04.605
Yeah,
it fucking serves me right.

1:30:30.631 --> 1:30:33.935
Oh, God. Damn it. Fuck.

1:30:39.507 --> 1:30:40.741
Winna.

1:30:42.643 --> 1:30:44.745
You know Winna's got guards
everywhere, right?

1:30:44.779 --> 1:30:45.980
So?

1:30:47.882 --> 1:30:51.619
All right, give me a gun.

1:30:53.187 --> 1:30:54.956
Give me a fucking gun.

1:30:56.791 --> 1:30:58.491
Please?

1:31:15.309 --> 1:31:16.544
Ah!

1:31:29.690 --> 1:31:30.958
Knight is here.

1:31:45.039 --> 1:31:47.908
You were right.
We should have gotten more guards.

1:31:56.617 --> 1:32:00.087
Goddamn. Rhodes too?

1:32:00.121 --> 1:32:02.123
That means the cops
aren't far behind.

1:32:04.125 --> 1:32:07.561
Will you just kill the guy?

1:32:07.595 --> 1:32:08.629
Please?

1:32:09.330 --> 1:32:11.966
Now?
Yeah.

1:32:11.999 --> 1:32:13.300
Thank you.

1:32:33.854 --> 1:32:35.556
Where's the card?

1:32:37.858 --> 1:32:38.893
The cash first.

1:32:38.926 --> 1:32:40.795
I got your cash.

1:32:58.813 --> 1:33:01.015
Kill the cop.
Move on the family.

1:33:14.261 --> 1:33:16.230
Fuck.

1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:27.975
I gotta do everything myself.

1:33:41.922 --> 1:33:43.257
Get out of the way.

1:34:07.848 --> 1:34:09.850
Motherfucker.

1:34:17.158 --> 1:34:18.192
Hey!

1:34:23.797 --> 1:34:25.132
Wish he'd have wrote.

1:34:35.843 --> 1:34:38.078
Fuck!

1:34:45.886 --> 1:34:46.921
How's the knee?

1:35:09.176 --> 1:35:10.911
Guards!

1:35:12.846 --> 1:35:13.914
Guards!

1:35:22.823 --> 1:35:24.091
Guards!

1:35:55.590 --> 1:35:57.424
Trick or treat, motherfucker!

1:36:31.425 --> 1:36:33.528
I wanted this
for a long time.

1:36:34.261 --> 1:36:35.429
Fuck.

1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:36.890
Sir, we found Knight.
Rhodes ran off.

1:37:36.924 --> 1:37:39.326
Uh, what do you want us
to do about Knight, sir?

1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:42.162
Take him.

1:37:42.196 --> 1:37:44.599
Don't move. Hold it.

1:37:45.099 --> 1:37:46.967
Cuff him.

1:37:50.971 --> 1:37:52.206
<i>We got him.</i>

1:38:02.249 --> 1:38:03.417
Trick or treat.

1:38:05.953 --> 1:38:08.422
The other house had
full-size candy bars.

1:38:09.022 --> 1:38:11.291
Oh, thank you.

1:38:11.325 --> 1:38:12.459
Come on.

1:38:26.106 --> 1:38:28.041
You having fun?
Yeah.

1:38:28.075 --> 1:38:29.343
Okay, good.

1:38:44.224 --> 1:38:45.192
Wait.

1:38:52.366 --> 1:38:55.202
-Hey. Hey.
-Casey?

1:38:58.506 --> 1:38:59.607
No, no.

1:39:02.276 --> 1:39:03.477
- Hands up.
- No.

1:39:03.511 --> 1:39:05.045
Hands up!

1:39:09.149 --> 1:39:10.184
Oh, my God.

1:39:17.224 --> 1:39:19.426
No, sweetie. No. No.

1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:23.363
You got the right
to remain silent. Easy.

1:39:23.397 --> 1:39:24.732
Stop hurting my dad!

1:39:24.766 --> 1:39:27.100
Oh, my God.

1:39:27.134 --> 1:39:29.604
Don't do anything to my dad!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry!

1:39:29.637 --> 1:39:31.371
I'll find a way
to make this right!
