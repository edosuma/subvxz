08:56.270 --> 08:57.402
My picture is good though,
right?

08:57.504 --> 08:59.638
It was my idea
to lean in that doorway.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.639
- Sure, uh, look,

09:01.642 --> 09:02.440
I just didn't realize
that you got the award

09:03.343 --> 09:05.010
for "flattening
the homelessness curve".

09:05.112 --> 09:07.312
- Mm-hmm,
not all heroes wear capes.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.381
Although I did just order
a cape from asos.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.816
- Return it.
Don't even open the box.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.920
Look, I didn't necessarily want
to tell you this today,

09:15.022 --> 09:18.356
but my team has been cleaning
up data from the past year

09:18.458 --> 09:20.759
and the city's homeless count
was a mess--

09:20.861 --> 09:22.694
- what?
- Look, I'm happy to share

09:22.796 --> 09:24.563
the data inconsistencies
with you,

09:24.665 --> 09:25.797
because they definitely suggest

09:25.899 --> 09:29.200
that the unhoused population
went up.

09:29.303 --> 09:32.604
- Wow, I can't tell if you're
just desperate to convince neil

09:32.706 --> 09:34.005
that you're more useful
than me,

09:34.107 --> 09:35.941
or if you just can't stand
that I got an award

09:36.043 --> 09:37.642
that isn't just
for corporate sellouts.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.210
- Malala was on the same
list with me.

09:39.313 --> 09:40.512
- Well, the creative exec
who runs

09:40.614 --> 09:42.747
her production shingle was
on mine, okay?

09:42.849 --> 09:46.351
Arpi? Arpi, the I-team
is trying to claim

09:46.453 --> 09:48.286
that our homeless count
was off.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.721
- Is this all how you
consulting groans

09:49.823 --> 09:51.856
know how to do?
Regurgitate things

09:51.959 --> 09:54.025
other people have been
saying forever?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.627
- Wait you agree with james?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.729
No, arpi,
he's the villain here.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.230
- Oh, come on, I am a good guy.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.398
I haven't said anything about

10:00.484 --> 10:02.267
how that award misspelled
"absolutely."

10:02.369 --> 10:03.668
- oh, come--[gasps]

10:03.770 --> 10:05.370
- the homeless count
is never right.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.039
L.A. Doesn't have the resources
to recruit, train,

10:08.141 --> 10:10.875
or equip enough volunteers
for a proper count.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.111
So the city took a page
from new york--

10:13.213 --> 10:14.746
- the "flavor of love"
contestant.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.748
You mean the city.
New york city.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.351
Okay. I'm starting
to feel this fifth can.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.419
- Nyc conducts
its homeless count

10:21.521 --> 10:22.887
on the coldest night
of the year,

10:22.990 --> 10:24.923
when the fewest people
are actually on the street.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.058
But since l.A.
Is never that cold,

10:27.160 --> 10:30.862
dhs decided our count
would be on oscar night.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.864
- The day l.A.
Moves all the unhoused people

10:32.966 --> 10:36.001

to the city of glendale.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.302
- And potential volunteers

10:37.404 --> 10:39.037

at home with oscar fever.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.640

thought in the 21st century,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.576
in los angeles,
homelessness didn't go up?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.911
- But, but I got a trophy--

10:47.014 --> 10:50.415
- and you "absotudely"
don't deserve it.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.083
I'll be on the roof.

They're not that safe.

11:11.972 --> 11:15.340

it's dehumanizing.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.063
- Well if it's all a housing
cost issue,

14:25.148 --> 14:26.931
we can just raise
the minimum wage--

14:27.033 --> 14:28.299
- to keep up with inflation.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.702
We need to raise it

14:30.787 --> 14:32.237
What else you got?
- Okay.

14:32.322 --> 14:36.007
Um, we could build more
single room occupancy units--

14:36.109 --> 14:39.711
- nimby. Angelenos don't
want 'em in their backyards.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.680
Community boards block that
every time we try it. Next.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.349
- Then declare a state
of emergency--

14:45.802 --> 14:47.468
Don't give us
extra funding or power.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.721

equinox memberships.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.790
- And clear everybody out by
5:00 am for "best butt ever"?

14:52.893 --> 14:54.926

as the only boy in a tap show.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.828
- Okay, okay. Withdrawn.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.163
- Look, I get that
the situation is worse

17:45.198 --> 17:46.731
than when we arrived,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.633
and I might not have
a quick fix for that.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.802
But I think if we're going
to be persistent about it,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.004
we first need to get
a real accurate count,

17:53.039 --> 17:55.573
and I need the I-team
to help me with that.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.810
- Oh, okay. Great.

17:58.845 --> 18:03.347
But you do realize that if
we get a truly accurate count,

18:03.383 --> 18:05.016
we're not gonna get any praise.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.185
You know, if anything, it's
just gonna make people more--

18:07.220 --> 18:08.686
- more furious with us? Yeah.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.022
I'm familiar with how ugly
social media can be.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.090
I posted a picture of myself
in the cape that I bought

18:13.109 --> 18:15.159
and I trended briefly
as "lady farquaad."

18:15.195 --> 18:17.161
- wow, that's an old reference.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.198
Well, don't worry. I got you.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.634
Uh, I mean, we got you.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.136
- Well, thank you,

18:25.171 --> 18:27.705
and I look forward
to working with you as well.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.042
- Ooh-whoo!

18:31.077 --> 18:33.211
Sorry, I was watching the
"saved by the bell" reboot

18:33.246 --> 18:35.012
on my phone.
[giggles]

18:35.515 --> 18:37.215
- yeah.
[clears throat]

18:37.250 --> 18:38.316
- thank you, stephen.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.319
I'm not sure how dating
your mom would help the city,

18:41.354 --> 18:42.920
but she seems like
a lovely woman

18:42.956 --> 18:46.157
I will certainly keep
her number on file.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.492
- Nice work, stephen.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.828
- Chopper's on the roof, boss.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.731
- That's it! That's this
year's staff t-shirt.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.167
- Whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, sir?

18:56.202 --> 18:58.903
- Arpi, I've been here
for four hours.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.005
I can't use any of these ideas.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.940
- It doesn't matter.
It's yes day,

19:02.976 --> 19:04.575
and you promised your children.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.878
Jayden's not going
to be 41 forever.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.915
- Okay, kwapis,
let's hear your pitch.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.383
- Great. Actually,
I have ten pitches--

19:12.418 --> 19:13.751
- you can do one--
- four?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.253
- One.
- 29?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.621
- One.
- Fine.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.322
I wrote it out.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.959
[clears throat]
"I get sad when we all fight.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.195
"I think siblings should be
nice to their siblings

19:24.230 --> 19:26.430
and share things with them."

19:26.466 --> 19:28.199
- sure. Yeah.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.401
And that's your pitch
for the city of los angeles?

19:30.436 --> 19:34.071
- Yes, I say we invite all of
l.A.'s sister cities to visit

19:34.107 --> 19:35.907
because then we can
all share ideas.

19:36.776 --> 19:40.178
Athens has dealt with smog
and hosting a recent olympics.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.447
Auckland is a leader
in gun control and green tech.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.982
And split, croatia?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.118
That's where "game of thrones"
filmed dragon stuff.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.787
It is time that l.A.
Got to know its 25 sisters

19:49.822 --> 19:51.289
and they got to know
their one brother.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.357
Because l.A. Is a boy.

19:54.093 --> 19:57.028
- Jayden that's actually great.
It's global,

19:57.063 --> 19:59.230
and it shows our commitment
to new ideas.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.299
- And, frankly,
unlike most I-team ideas,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.301
we could probably do it
by the end of the year.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.970
- Almost makes me want to hear
your other 28 pitches.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.838
- Idea number two, city lizard.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.307
It's like city bike
but with lizards,

20:09.342 --> 20:11.475
for angelenos whose moms
are lizard-reluctant.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.944
- Okay, thank you.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.681
- Teri.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.116
- Oh, how are you
the hardest part of my day?

20:19.152 --> 20:21.051
- Teri,
I just wanted to apologize

20:21.070 --> 20:22.987
for overlooking the problems
in the shelter

20:23.022 --> 20:24.322
and to let you know
that we're gonna get

20:24.357 --> 20:27.558
a true, accurate count
of the unhoused population.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.694
It won't fix everything,

20:29.729 --> 20:32.163
but it's the first step
towards real solutions.

20:32.198 --> 20:32.930
- Cool.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.782
So is this the part
in your movie

20:34.834 --> 20:37.768
where that kt tunstall song
starts to play?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.103
- Yeah, you know what?
I was lying before.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.505
Teri isn't
that pretty of a name.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.242
- Thank you for that.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.079
- For what?
- You didn't patronize me.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.681
I miss people feeling
comfortable to be

20:50.717 --> 20:52.316
low-stakes petty around me.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.353
- Oh, low-stakes petty
is where I reside.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.623
Can I tell you how much
I hate my sister's baby?

20:58.658 --> 20:59.890
- If you buy me sweetgreen.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.827
- Okay, deal.
- Okay.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.562
So the second
that I got this job,

21:04.597 --> 21:05.830
she took her first steps,
and apparently

21:05.865 --> 21:07.865
it was
"early for her age".

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
Okay, vivian, I see you.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.702
Also, she stays acting like
she can't pronounce my name.

21:11.738 --> 21:12.803
She calls me g-boo.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.240
That's not even close.
G-boo? My name is mikaela.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.775
- Yeah,
I'm also going to be needing

21:17.794 --> 21:20.478
a jasmine lemonade, g-boo.
- Totally.
