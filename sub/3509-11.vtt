WEBVTT

00:02.415 --> 00:04.574
Game over, and you lose, Tom.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.490
Drop it. Put down the gun, or I
swear, I'll blow his head off.

00:07.491 --> 00:08.890
You know I can't do that, Tom.

00:08.891 --> 00:10.646
You think I'm kidding around here,
detective Heat?

00:10.647 --> 00:12.371
No, I don't.

00:12.372 --> 00:15.135
I think you feel trapped,
and you're serious as hell.

00:15.234 --> 00:16.138
But right now

00:16.139 --> 00:18.613
I need you to think about
the people who love you.

00:18.614 --> 00:22.128
And they need you to
put down that gun.

00:22.129 --> 00:23.623
I can't take it anymore.

00:24.722 --> 00:26.164
The character of Nikki Heat

00:26.165 --> 00:28.836
is a smart, complicated detective

00:28.837 --> 00:31.235
with... with enormous depth,

00:31.236 --> 00:34.785
and then... the
studio goes and casts

00:34.786 --> 00:36.579
the braless coed in
blood-soaked t-shirt

00:36.580 --> 00:37.334
from "Knife II"?

00:37.335 --> 00:38.885
Oh, "Knife II"
made a lot of money, honey,

00:38.886 --> 00:41.697
thanks in no small
part to Natalie Rhodes.

00:41.878 --> 00:44.277
And your books are not exactly
Shakespeare. Thank you.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.058
I was just hoping to
elevate their stature

00:47.135 --> 00:47.691
by not casting

00:47.692 --> 00:48.859
the chainsaw wielding hooker

00:48.860 --> 00:51.412
from "Hallowscream."
Hey, I like that movie.

00:51.904 --> 00:53.242
If I'd seen it, which I haven't.

00:53.243 --> 00:57.089
Look, this is an audition tape.
Give the girl a chance.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.540
According to "US Weekly," for
her movie "Hell's Crawl Space,"

00:59.541 --> 01:01.673
she actually lived in her
house's crawl space for a week

01:01.674 --> 01:03.529
to prepare for the role.
Well, you gotta admit,

01:03.530 --> 01:05.373
that's, uh,
dedication to the craft.

01:05.375 --> 01:09.151
How about that dialogue? 
I mean, how hacky is that?

01:10.299 --> 01:12.570
"Right now you need to think
about the people who love you."

01:12.571 --> 01:14.731
Like that's gonna stop a murderer?

01:14.732 --> 01:17.152
That screenwriter needs to
spend a week in a crawl space.

01:17.153 --> 01:19.341
Okay, darling,
enough with the complaining.

01:21.865 --> 01:22.988
It's Beckett.

01:23.177 --> 01:26.359
She is gonna hate the
idea of Natalie Rhodes.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.285
Pick it up, dad. A murder
will make you feel better.

01:32.803 --> 01:33.780
Morning, boys.

01:34.102 --> 01:37.126
Excuse me. Hey, Castle.
How's it going?

01:37.624 --> 01:38.931
Good. What's up?

01:41.736 --> 01:42.673
Ryan.

01:44.094 --> 01:44.999
I don't know what to say.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.297
I mean, I'm flattered, but...

01:46.298 --> 01:48.837
Oh, come on.
It's nice, right? Right?

01:49.256 --> 01:50.709
Jenny is a lucky girl.

01:50.727 --> 01:51.837
So how are you gonna
pop the question...

01:51.838 --> 01:54.477
Hot air balloon,
skywriter, jumbotron?

01:54.478 --> 01:55.932
Uh, I thought I'd just ask.

01:55.933 --> 01:59.522
No, no. You can't "just ask."

01:59.767 --> 02:01.959
You gotta make a statement.
It's gotta be big.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.366
A helicopter ride...
Actually, most girls

02:03.367 --> 02:05.418
prefer something a
little more intimate.

02:05.582 --> 02:07.867
What, so he's just supposed
to be boring and ask,

02:08.519 --> 02:09.779
will you marry me?

02:13.415 --> 02:15.805
And helicopter rides are intimate.

02:15.806 --> 02:18.487
Yeah, sure, if you want to
share the most romantic moment

02:18.488 --> 02:21.196
of your life with Reggie
the chopper pilot.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074

02:32.155 --> 02:35.935
Our victim is Stacey Collins.
She's 45.

02:35.936 --> 02:36.942
According to her business card,

02:36.943 --> 02:40.131
she's a high-end matchmaker.
Like "Millionaire Matchmaker."

02:40.132 --> 02:41.835
Without the reality show.
Or pulse.

02:41.836 --> 02:44.719
That, too. Defensive wounds
indicate that she was attacked.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.953
We found her purse with wallet,
credit card and cash inside.

02:47.954 --> 02:49.883
But the thing that was
missing were her keys.

02:49.884 --> 02:51.876
Uniforms are on their way
to her apartment and office

02:51.877 --> 02:53.665
to see if our killer
decided to use them.

02:53.666 --> 02:56.709
Yo. So apparently our victim
was at a surprise party

02:56.710 --> 02:58.019
thrown in her honor last night

02:58.020 --> 02:58.839
by all the happy couples

02:58.840 --> 03:00.903
that she'd matched up.
Where was the party?

03:00.904 --> 03:02.518
Oscar's Grill, 85th and Third.

03:02.519 --> 03:03.777
That's only seven
blocks from here.

03:03.778 --> 03:05.500
Collins left the party
just before 10:00.

03:05.501 --> 03:07.848
M.E. estimates the time of
death between 10:00 and 11:00.

03:07.849 --> 03:10.296
Killer could've been at the
party and followed her.

03:10.297 --> 03:11.791
Gosh. You don't think
a married person

03:11.792 --> 03:15.048
killed the woman who gave
them such happiness, do you?

03:17.474 --> 03:19.806
Yeah, I'll start on
bringing them in.

03:24.642 --> 03:26.397
Surprise visit from the mayor?

03:26.698 --> 03:27.612
Better.

03:39.524 --> 03:40.613
Holy smoke.

03:40.817 --> 03:42.284
That's Natalie Rhodes.

03:43.961 --> 03:45.055
It sure is.

03:45.173 --> 03:47.996
Apparently she is
playing Nikki Heat.

03:47.997 --> 03:49.625
What? That's awesome.

03:49.626 --> 03:52.093
Yeah, it's awesome. What is she
doing here? She called and asked

03:52.094 --> 03:53.497
if she could shadow
me for a little while.

03:53.498 --> 03:55.576
She wanted to get an authentic
feel for what it's like

03:55.577 --> 03:57.575
to be Nikki by following the

03:57.576 --> 04:00.210
person who inspired Nikki.
And you said yes?

04:00.211 --> 04:01.015
Yeah.

04:01.016 --> 04:04.423
Detective Beckett.
My God. You are exactly

04:04.424 --> 04:06.679
what I imagined Nikki
Heat would look like.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.004
Natalie, this is Richard Castle.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.413
And this is detective
Javier Esposito.

04:11.513 --> 04:12.432
Hey.

04:12.713 --> 04:14.103
Just so you know, detective,

04:14.104 --> 04:15.452
I'm very method.

04:15.530 --> 04:17.146
So it's all about
getting inside of you,

04:17.147 --> 04:19.112
which starts with
observing and noting.

04:19.113 --> 04:21.612
Okay. Well, observe and note away.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.161
I'm already used to it.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.197
I'm sorry. I don't think you heard.
I'm Richard Castle.

04:27.510 --> 04:28.426
Great.

04:28.648 --> 04:31.346
I-I wrote "Heat Wave."

04:31.470 --> 04:34.010
Oh. I thought your
name sounded familiar.

04:35.047 --> 04:37.898
Hey, I just got off the phone
with the guys at the, uh...

04:39.286 --> 04:40.242
Hi.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.419
Natalie, this is
detective Kevin Ryan.

04:45.141 --> 04:47.337
Uh... hi.

04:48.119 --> 04:50.092
Ryan, the call?

04:50.269 --> 04:52.154
Yeah. Looks like our killer

04:52.155 --> 04:53.951
took our victim's
keys for a reason.

04:53.952 --> 04:56.431
Uniforms just got to her office.
Place has been tossed.

04:56.432 --> 04:58.287
You guys go to the office,
see what the killer was after.

04:58.288 --> 04:59.886
We'll go interview
party guests and see

04:59.887 --> 05:02.707
if we can shed some light on
what this was all about. Right.

05:04.895 --> 05:05.805
Come on.

05:08.721 --> 05:09.706
Hello.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.525
I'm your creator.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.235
So who would want to
kill a matchmaker?

05:15.236 --> 05:17.104
Well, that's what
we have to find out.

05:17.105 --> 05:20.254
And the first 48 hours
are the most critical.

05:20.255 --> 05:23.005
After that,
evidence gets corrupted,

05:23.006 --> 05:25.614
witnesses get less reliable,

05:25.615 --> 05:27.332
and... Oh.

05:28.401 --> 05:29.791
I'm so sorry everyone is staring.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.764
I already talked to them,
but it's just...

05:31.872 --> 05:34.374
It's not every day we get
someone famous in here.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.195
Listen up, everybody.

05:36.519 --> 05:37.709
This is Natalie Rhodes.

05:37.710 --> 05:39.575
She will be shadowing
me for a little while,

05:39.576 --> 05:41.837
so if you want to gawk,
just get it over with

05:41.838 --> 05:43.660
so we can all get back to work.

05:43.661 --> 05:45.682
And if anyone wants a
picture and autograph,

05:45.683 --> 05:47.143
just come on over.

05:53.223 --> 05:55.827
I can't believe you said it
was okay for her to tail us

05:55.879 --> 05:57.588
without asking me first.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.766
Not "us," Castle. Me.

06:00.287 --> 06:01.610
Oh, my God.

06:02.135 --> 06:03.696
You like her, don't you?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.296
Mm. Yeah. So?

06:05.297 --> 06:07.375
So was it her work in
"Mutilation High"

06:07.376 --> 06:10.221
that changed your life,
or perhaps "Demon Patrol"?

06:10.222 --> 06:11.879
Well, the way that she
beheaded those zombies

06:11.880 --> 06:13.356
with the samurai sword
was pretty cool.

06:13.357 --> 06:16.329
Yes, it was cool, but that
does not make her Nikki Heat.

06:16.749 --> 06:17.984
Nikki Heat...

06:18.398 --> 06:21.522
Is classy, she's complicated,
she's a...

06:21.583 --> 06:23.075
A thinking-man's cop.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.880
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:27.075 --> 06:28.970
Yeah. Well, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.912
Yes. Actually, yes, I can,
when it's my book.

06:32.499 --> 06:34.265
And she's a civilian.

06:34.313 --> 06:35.730
I mean, aren't you afraid
she's gonna get in the way

06:35.731 --> 06:38.472
and mess up the case?
You're kidding, right?

06:41.279 --> 06:42.882
Right this way, please.

06:43.717 --> 06:46.599
Hey, Natalie. Want to join
in on your first interview?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.398
Yep. Be right there. 
Okay, ready?

06:48.399 --> 06:50.570
Hey, that looks great!

06:52.518 --> 06:54.498
Our killer was definitely
after something.

06:55.101 --> 06:56.893
"Pleased to meet you, Ms. Rhodes."

06:56.894 --> 06:58.450
How hard is that to say?

06:58.623 --> 07:01.150
Now she thinks I'm an idiot.
Yeah, probably.

07:01.151 --> 07:04.051
Great. And she's on my list. 
What?

07:04.052 --> 07:06.414
My freebie five. You know,
the celebrities you're allowed

07:06.415 --> 07:08.094
to make an exception with
if you ever got the chance?

07:08.095 --> 07:11.291
Jenny even knows.
I wouldn't worry about it, bro.

07:11.374 --> 07:14.187
Oh, my God. What happened?

07:14.550 --> 07:15.525
And you are?

07:15.526 --> 07:18.898
Julie Taylor, I work here,
for Stacey Collins.

07:19.725 --> 07:21.922
I'm afraid we have some bad
news for you, Ms. Taylor.

07:24.116 --> 07:26.104
Well, I hope we were helpful.

07:27.219 --> 07:28.156
Wow.

07:28.228 --> 07:30.569
Are all the folks you interview
always that unhelpful?

07:30.570 --> 07:31.695
It's a numbers game.

07:31.696 --> 07:34.660
You talk to enough people,
something usually shakes out.

07:34.661 --> 07:36.975
That is going in the movie.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.869
Yeah, being a cop, it's...

07:40.243 --> 07:42.224
Kind of like being a prospector.

07:42.235 --> 07:43.345
You gotta sift
through a lot of rock

07:43.346 --> 07:46.884
before you finally hit gold.
No. Her line was better.

07:46.885 --> 07:50.364
"Usually shakes out."

07:52.142 --> 07:54.549
Besides client files,
was there anything of value here?

07:54.550 --> 07:56.211
Did she keep cash on hand?

07:56.212 --> 07:58.524
No. I mean, especially not lately.

07:58.525 --> 08:02.235
Business is way down. 
Did you guys take a hit from the economy?

08:02.236 --> 08:05.551
Mostly it was Stacey.
She kept turning down clients.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.654
Why would she do that?
All I know is,

08:07.655 --> 08:10.534
two months ago, she started
rejecting applications,

08:10.535 --> 08:13.160
and here we are, barely making it.

08:13.161 --> 08:14.950
We think the killer may have
followed her from the event.

08:14.951 --> 08:17.230
Did she have issues
with any of the guests?

08:17.231 --> 08:20.635
Oh, no. Those were
her success stories...

08:20.636 --> 08:21.777
60 happy couples.

08:21.778 --> 08:23.967
They put the party
together in her honor.

08:23.968 --> 08:27.054
They wanted her to see how
many lives she'd touched.

08:27.697 --> 08:29.317
You know what's so sad?

08:29.448 --> 08:32.089
I don't think that Stacey ever
found a soul mate for herself.

08:32.090 --> 08:35.078
It's crazy. Without her,
we wouldn't even be together.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.111
How can she be dead?

08:36.113 --> 08:38.645
Was there anyone acting
strangely at the party?

08:38.645 --> 08:40.120
Not that we noticed.

08:42.821 --> 08:45.793
What about after the party?
Did you see Stacey leave?

08:45.794 --> 08:47.658
Actually, yeah,
someone picked her up.

08:47.659 --> 08:51.389
Any idea who? 
I didn't see. The cars windows were tinted.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.968
What kind of ve...
what kind of vehicle was it?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.399
A sports car.

08:55.596 --> 08:58.286
It was a Boxster,
a silver Boxster.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.399
Did she have any enemies,

08:59.400 --> 09:01.542
anybody who might have
wanted to do her harm?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.509
Oh, man. 
What?

09:04.936 --> 09:06.031
Brad Williams...

09:06.032 --> 09:08.661
Stacey's boyfriend,
until yesterday.

09:08.865 --> 09:09.965
What happened yesterday?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.924
When I came in in the morning,
they were fighting.

09:11.925 --> 09:15.669
- About what? - I don't know,
but they were both pretty upset.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.285
Brad was screaming, and
Stacey just told him to leave.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.533
I think I heard him say

09:21.534 --> 09:23.678
he wanted her to give
him something back.

09:23.679 --> 09:25.874
Do you have any idea what? 
No.

09:26.806 --> 09:27.802
Excuse me.

09:30.455 --> 09:32.465
Did Brad know about
the party? Esposito.

09:32.466 --> 09:34.088
Oh, he was gonna be there,

09:34.089 --> 09:37.744
but then when they split up,
I had to uninvite him.

09:37.754 --> 09:40.634
Ms. Taylor, does
anyone in Stacey's life

09:40.635 --> 09:42.455
drive a silver Boxster?

09:42.547 --> 09:44.991
Yeah. Brad does.

09:53.358 --> 09:55.856
I was in love with Stacey.
What makes you think

09:55.857 --> 09:58.305
I could possibly kill her?
If you were so in love with her,

09:58.306 --> 10:01.558
why did you have a screaming
match in her office yesterday?

10:01.722 --> 10:05.637
We argue. I'm a passionate
person. Obviously.

10:06.678 --> 10:08.120
And then after she dumped you,

10:08.121 --> 10:10.293
you couldn't handle the rejection,

10:10.294 --> 10:12.901
and so you killed her.
That's not true.

10:12.902 --> 10:15.934
When you and Stacey fought, you
said you wanted something back.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.952
What was it? 
My dignity.

10:17.953 --> 10:21.453
You trashed her office
looking for your dignity?

10:21.466 --> 10:24.380
I didn't kill her and I
didn't trash her office.

10:24.401 --> 10:28.064
Stacey stepped out on me.
That's why we broke up.

10:28.065 --> 10:30.328
And that gives you even greater
reason to have killed her.

10:30.329 --> 10:31.810
She's amazing. You think
that I'd tell you that...

10:31.811 --> 10:35.569
Look at her eye contact.
The way she won't let go...

10:36.228 --> 10:37.239
I love that.

10:37.740 --> 10:40.504
So what did you think of
"Heat Wave"?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.024
Are you kidding? 
I love it.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.642
Spike Rosenberg is one of
my favorite screenwriters.

10:45.643 --> 10:47.252
You know, he did the
uncredited final pass

10:47.253 --> 10:49.155
on "Hell's Crawl Space." 
Yeah.

10:49.156 --> 10:50.996
Not the... not the script,
the book...

10:50.997 --> 10:53.224
the... the... the real "Heat Wave."

10:53.225 --> 10:54.879
I haven't read it.

10:55.932 --> 10:57.763
You... you took the
part of Nikki Heat

10:57.764 --> 11:00.321
without even reading the book?

11:00.413 --> 11:02.874
Well, Spike made a lot of
changes in the screenplay.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.091
I didn't want to confuse
the character in my head.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.115
"Changes."

11:10.151 --> 11:11.386
What... what changes?

11:11.387 --> 11:14.232
And then two months ago,
she started to pull away.

11:14.305 --> 11:16.866
Next came some phone calls
at odd hours from some guy.

11:16.867 --> 11:19.693
She wouldn't say who.
I mean, the signs were all there,

11:19.694 --> 11:21.237
I just didn't want to see them.

11:21.238 --> 11:22.613
Well, just because she
was getting phone calls

11:22.614 --> 11:24.572
doesn't mean that she
was having an affair.

11:24.894 --> 11:28.538
I followed her last week,
saw her meet the guy...

11:28.549 --> 11:29.952
a real lowlife.

11:29.968 --> 11:32.525
When I confronted her,
she denied everything.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.292
I called her a liar.

11:36.633 --> 11:37.956
And now she's dead.

11:38.151 --> 11:41.057
And then prior to her death,
she was seen getting into your car.

11:41.058 --> 11:43.858
After the party, I offered her a ride,
thinking we could talk.

11:43.859 --> 11:44.653
Where did you go?

11:44.654 --> 11:47.929
Nowhere. She was barely in
the car when he called again.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.743
I started to get upset.
She just got out.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.384
Then where'd you go after

11:51.385 --> 11:53.813
you dropped her off?
I didn't go anywhere.

11:53.968 --> 11:55.783
I noticed I was in front
of the Nautilus Diner.

11:55.784 --> 11:59.179
I went in and was there
until after midnight.

11:59.247 --> 12:01.115
The hostess at Nautilus
confirms Brad's story.

12:01.116 --> 12:03.712
Has him there from a few minutes
after 10:00 till about midnight,

12:03.713 --> 12:05.795
drowning his sorrows in
five orders of baklava.

12:05.796 --> 12:07.952
Ooh. I love their baklava.

12:07.953 --> 12:10.713
The honey actually oozes
out of the sides...

12:11.057 --> 12:13.385
But the salient point here

12:13.386 --> 12:16.698
is that Brad Williams
just alibied out.

12:16.741 --> 12:17.996
Check into Stacey's phone records.

12:17.997 --> 12:20.295
- Let's see if we can find
that new boyfriend. - Right.

12:22.998 --> 12:26.050
Oh, C.S.U. found a key
hidden under a ceiling tile.

12:26.051 --> 12:27.884
They say there's no
lockbox in Stacey's office

12:27.885 --> 12:29.378
and her assistant
doesn't recognize it,

12:29.379 --> 12:30.548
so C.S.U. is running it down.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.711
Well, maybe that's what the
killer was looking for.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.765
Maybe it's the key

12:34.845 --> 12:37.596
to unlocking the mystery
of Stacey's murder.

12:40.016 --> 12:41.552
So what are you thinking
about right now, detective?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.970
What's our next move?

12:42.979 --> 12:46.504
I'm thinking...
I need a cup of coffee.

12:46.505 --> 12:49.119
Me, too. God, we are so in sync.

12:54.302 --> 12:55.089
Hey, Castle.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.464
So I-I... I booked
that chopper ride.

12:57.465 --> 12:59.081
We're even gonna fly
over K.J. McDoogal's.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.255
It's the bar where
Jenny and I met.

13:01.256 --> 13:02.895
And then tomorrow,
I'm going out to flushing

13:02.896 --> 13:04.016
to ask her parents for her hand.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.751
I told Jenny I'm playing
darts with Esposito.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.259
All right. Well, you're all set.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.493
Um, I-I still need to
pick a romantic restaurant

13:10.494 --> 13:13.397
that's near the west
side heliport. Any ideas?

13:16.214 --> 13:17.288
Does she like Italian?

13:17.289 --> 13:19.128
You are amazing.
Oh.

13:19.129 --> 13:20.168
In fact, I've already picked up

13:20.169 --> 13:23.504
on a couple of your little secrets.
Oh, really. Like what?

13:23.505 --> 13:26.458
That thing you do, pushing
your hair back behind your ear,

13:26.459 --> 13:28.614
it's a device to distract
whomever you're talking to.

13:28.615 --> 13:30.700
Gives you an extra few seconds
to think about what to say.

13:30.701 --> 13:33.534
Huh. Really? I did not know that.

13:33.535 --> 13:36.483
Yeah, and there's those
crazy 4-inch spiked heels.

13:36.484 --> 13:38.689
God, they must be hell to run in.

13:38.982 --> 13:39.817
You know, you wouldn't admit it,

13:39.818 --> 13:41.355
but it's tough being
an attractive woman

13:41.356 --> 13:44.512
in such a testosterone-fueled
profession.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.088
The heels give you stature.
When guys have to

13:46.089 --> 13:49.935
literally look up to you, it
gives you a psychological edge.

13:49.936 --> 13:51.854
Well, you're right about
the heels and the stature.

13:51.855 --> 13:54.206
But it's not because I need it.
I just like it.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.171
Yo, Beckett.

13:56.668 --> 13:57.872
We got something.

14:02.364 --> 14:03.194
Brad was right.

14:03.195 --> 14:05.573
Stacey did get a call just
before she was killed,

14:05.755 --> 14:07.403
from one Duke Jones.

14:07.404 --> 14:09.295
Guy's got a sheet that
reads like a primer

14:09.296 --> 14:11.019
on small-time crookery.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.484
We got B&Es, racketeering,
and assault.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.173
What's a high-class matchmaker
doing with a guy like that?

14:16.174 --> 14:18.314
Whatever it is, I'm guessing
that it's complicated.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.139
According to Stacey's
bank records,

14:20.140 --> 14:22.383
she was making weekly
payments of $5,000 to the guy

14:22.384 --> 14:24.014
for the last two months.

14:24.547 --> 14:25.373
Anyone else notice

14:25.374 --> 14:27.403
that two months has
been a recurring theme?

14:27.404 --> 14:28.345
What was the money for?

14:28.346 --> 14:31.100
I don't know. Neither does her
boyfriend or her assistant.

14:31.101 --> 14:33.215
Well, it looks like we'll
have to ask him ourselves.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.246
Ready to hit the bricks, Natalie? 
Yeah.

14:37.372 --> 14:40.266
Just have to put on your
basic famous person disguise

14:40.267 --> 14:42.020
so I'm less distracting.

14:42.266 --> 14:43.704
Does that really fool people?

14:43.979 --> 14:45.920
Yeah. It works in L.A.

14:46.371 --> 14:48.801
What about you? Do you do
anything to hide your fame?

14:49.171 --> 14:51.046
It doesn't really
come up that much.

15:02.499 --> 15:03.434
Hi.

15:04.162 --> 15:05.160
Can I help you?

15:05.161 --> 15:06.295
Yeah, we're looking
for Duke Jones.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.277
* Who's looking for the Duke? *

15:08.608 --> 15:11.068
Detective Beckett. NYPD.

15:11.168 --> 15:13.378
Oh. Chloe...

15:13.624 --> 15:15.087
Why don't you get some air?

15:17.511 --> 15:19.899
We're investigating the
death of Stacey Collins.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.399
Stacey's dead?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.339
She was murdered. Ooh.

15:23.340 --> 15:27.009
What was the nature of your relationship?
I work as a P.I.

15:27.309 --> 15:30.386
She hired me to run background
checks on potential clients.

15:30.939 --> 15:32.728
At 5 grand a week?

15:32.797 --> 15:36.126
Seems pretty steep, especially
considering business was down.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.674
Hey. You get what you pay for.

15:39.077 --> 15:41.451
And what was that exactly?

15:41.990 --> 15:44.423
Let's just say,
I'm not afraid to go deep

15:44.424 --> 15:46.564
to find out who someone really is.

15:46.606 --> 15:50.264
And why would Stacey need
your services all of a sudden?

15:50.265 --> 15:53.622
So she could vet her clients.
She made a bad call

15:53.623 --> 15:54.352
on one of 'em, and it came

15:54.353 --> 15:56.667
back to bite her in the ass.
Did she tell you who?

15:56.668 --> 15:58.763
No. 
Nature of the, uh, ass biting?

15:58.764 --> 16:00.295
Not that either. 
You called

16:00.296 --> 16:02.983
Stacey 20 minutes
before she was killed.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.268
What was it about?

16:04.269 --> 16:05.834
I'd finished a background check.

16:05.835 --> 16:08.087
I was just giving
her the download.

16:08.088 --> 16:10.049
And where were you last night
between 10:00 and 11:00?

16:10.050 --> 16:15.265
Ooh. I was banging my neighbor.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.422
She can vouch for me.

16:17.968 --> 16:19.970
Great. We'll be
sure to talk to her.

16:19.971 --> 16:20.890
Mm.

16:20.891 --> 16:23.289
So you think this
ass-biting client

16:23.290 --> 16:25.240
might actually have something
to do with Stacey's death?

16:25.241 --> 16:27.080
Well, recent conflict
in a victim's life

16:27.081 --> 16:30.877
is definitely a red flag,
so we gotta look in to it.

16:31.114 --> 16:32.160
Excuse me, guys.

16:34.181 --> 16:35.287
Esposito.

16:35.556 --> 16:38.101
Yeah, I need you to look in to
a couple of Stacey's clients.

16:38.102 --> 16:40.081
She is crazy smart.

16:40.302 --> 16:43.434
You know, sexy... commanding.

16:43.727 --> 16:46.982
On a good day,
maybe I'm... one out of three.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.842
Well, that's why you're here,
isn't it,

16:48.843 --> 16:52.329
to learn the ways of Beckett?
I'm trying.

16:52.350 --> 16:55.903
You know, Nikki is such a complex,
juicy character.

16:56.638 --> 16:59.169
I just really want to
get her right, you know?

17:00.791 --> 17:02.861
Is it true you lived in
your house's crawl space

17:02.862 --> 17:05.204
for a week to prepare for
"Hell's Crawl Space"?

17:05.205 --> 17:06.194
No.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.318
A month. I told the
tabloids a week

17:09.319 --> 17:11.372
'cause I didn't want them
to think I was obsessive.

17:11.373 --> 17:14.231
Really? 
Okay. Thanks.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.491
So C.S.U. had a hit on
Stacey's hidden key.

17:18.492 --> 17:19.617
The one they found in her office.

17:19.618 --> 17:20.829
What's it for?

17:23.092 --> 17:23.800
All right.

17:23.801 --> 17:24.742
Stop there.

17:34.437 --> 17:36.182
Odd place to store luggage.

17:49.147 --> 17:51.117
Whoa. That's a lot of cash.

17:51.118 --> 17:53.380
That's gotta be at least a
couple of hundred grand.

17:53.934 --> 17:56.002
Now we know what our
killer was looking for.

18:00.515 --> 18:02.146
So according to
Stacey's assistant,

18:02.147 --> 18:05.434
the business barely had any money,
let alone 250 grand.

18:05.435 --> 18:07.707
And as for this Berglin-Eklof bag,

18:07.708 --> 18:11.138
it's definitely not Stacey's.
Our vic was a tumi girl.

18:11.139 --> 18:13.615
Well, maybe the money belongs
to the person who owns the bag.

18:13.616 --> 18:15.008
Yeah, well, good luck
finding that person.

18:15.009 --> 18:16.575
You can't pull prints off
of this kind of material.

18:16.576 --> 18:18.419
You can just check the registry.

18:18.695 --> 18:19.582
Registry?

18:19.583 --> 18:22.953
That's a $6,000,
handcrafted German bag.

18:22.954 --> 18:25.417
All Berglin-Eklofs are
signed and numbered.

18:25.418 --> 18:26.978
When you buy it,
you register with the company

18:26.979 --> 18:29.428
in case you lose it
or it gets stolen.

18:29.429 --> 18:33.198
What kind of an idiot would
pay 6 grand for this bag?

18:33.199 --> 18:34.594
I have a full set.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.642
There should be a number
sewn in there somewhere.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.937
A guy from Munich with
a colonel Klink accent

18:42.938 --> 18:45.225
just e-mailed over
the bag registration.

18:45.226 --> 18:48.509
The owner of this bag
is Tonya Wellington.

18:49.770 --> 18:52.729
You know, you might have just
cracked this case wide open.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.211
Seriously? 
Yeah.

18:54.212 --> 18:55.517
It's addictive, right...

18:55.518 --> 18:57.840
that rush you get
from solving a crime?

18:57.841 --> 19:00.665
Yeah. I didn't get
that from the script.

19:00.666 --> 19:04.071
Yeah. You should really read the book.
I definitely will.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.361
Yo. I knew that name was familiar.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.067
Tonya Wellington and
her husband Bill

19:08.068 --> 19:09.634
were invited to
Stacey's surprise party.

19:09.635 --> 19:12.090
But we talked to all the guests.
I don't remember that name.

19:12.091 --> 19:14.519
They were invited,
but they declined.

19:16.366 --> 19:17.851
Let's see if they'll
accept an invitation

19:17.852 --> 19:19.630
to my interrogation party.

19:21.763 --> 19:22.960
That's a little uncanny. Spooky.

19:22.961 --> 19:23.971
Sexy.

19:28.010 --> 19:29.971
Are you doing... me?

19:30.139 --> 19:32.017
I'm just working on your posture.

19:32.034 --> 19:33.023
You know, it changes

19:33.024 --> 19:35.926
depending whether you have a suspect or not.
Really?

19:35.927 --> 19:38.345
Like I said,
getting inside your head.

19:38.346 --> 19:40.663
When I'm done,
I'll do you better than you.

19:46.827 --> 19:48.775
Tonya Wellington. Now.

19:48.776 --> 19:49.669
Right.

19:58.634 --> 20:00.257
You were a client
of Stacey Collins,

20:00.258 --> 20:02.079
is that correct, Ms. Wellington?

20:03.897 --> 20:04.829
Yes.

20:04.906 --> 20:07.001
She introduced me
to my husband Bill.

20:07.002 --> 20:08.514
But you didn't go to
her party last night.

20:08.515 --> 20:10.227
Why is that? But you didn't

20:10.228 --> 20:12.241
go to her party last night.
Why is that?

20:12.242 --> 20:14.823
That was a great Beckett. 
Yeah.

20:14.929 --> 20:18.464
Almost creepy great.
Not that you're... creepy.

20:18.465 --> 20:20.830
Just... great.

20:23.809 --> 20:24.759
Ms. Wellington, we found

20:24.760 --> 20:27.141
a Berglin-Eklof bag
registered to you,

20:27.142 --> 20:29.573
containing $250,000,

20:29.574 --> 20:32.378
hidden in Stacey Collins' office.

20:32.777 --> 20:34.300
Can you explain where
that came from?

20:34.301 --> 20:35.461
I'm afraid Ms. Wellington chooses

20:35.462 --> 20:37.492
not to answer that question.

20:39.295 --> 20:41.132
Did you give Stacey that cash?

20:42.431 --> 20:43.834
What was it for?

20:46.222 --> 20:48.461
Ms. Wellington,
who else knew that she had it?

20:48.462 --> 20:49.721
Again, my client's asserting her

20:49.722 --> 20:52.016
right to not answer.
And I will remind your client

20:52.017 --> 20:53.464
that this is a
murder investigation,

20:53.465 --> 20:55.377
and I believe that
that bag and money

20:55.378 --> 20:57.731
are at the heart of this case.
Tread lightly,

20:57.732 --> 20:59.931
detective. My client's
here as a courtesy.

20:59.932 --> 21:01.244
And her husband, Bill Wellington,

21:01.245 --> 21:02.721
is a powerful man.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.248
Ms. Wellington...

21:07.772 --> 21:09.663
What happened two months ago?

21:10.860 --> 21:12.152
This meeting's over.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.132
Drop it. Put down the gun, or I
swear, I'll blow his head off.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.204
You know I can't do that, Tom.

21:25.205 --> 21:27.080
You think I'm kidding around here,
detective Heat?

21:27.081 --> 21:28.755
No, I don't. 
Torturing yourself?

21:28.756 --> 21:31.576
I think you feel trapped,
and you're serious as hell.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.567
Reconsidering actually.

21:34.796 --> 21:37.151
I think there's more
to her than I thought.

21:37.276 --> 21:38.899
I think she might surprise you.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.963
She had this great emotional
scene in "Knife 3D."

21:40.964 --> 21:42.735
It was actually pretty moving.

21:43.363 --> 21:45.311
If I'd seen it, which I haven't.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.718
Thanks, Castle.

21:56.719 --> 21:58.166
That... that's... I was...

21:58.428 --> 22:00.003
Uh, you're welcome.

22:00.907 --> 22:02.271
So... where are we?

22:02.272 --> 22:04.682
Ryan and Esposito are digging
in to Tonya Wellington.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.877
Mm. What about Duke Jones?

22:06.878 --> 22:08.926
His neighbor confirm his romantic evening?
He...

22:08.927 --> 22:10.104
So did a couple of other neighbors

22:10.105 --> 22:11.546
who complained about the noise.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.096
So it looks like Duke
Jones alibis out.

22:15.874 --> 22:17.016
What she said.

22:19.036 --> 22:20.624
Can we talk for a second?

22:21.028 --> 22:21.959
Sure.

22:26.626 --> 22:28.520
She took my coffee, Castle.

22:29.428 --> 22:30.472
It's just coffee.

22:30.795 --> 22:32.754
Then what's next, my soul?

22:32.755 --> 22:34.467
Everything I do, she does.

22:34.468 --> 22:37.377
Even when I'm thinking,
I can feel her in my head,

22:37.378 --> 22:39.471
like some kind of a
brain-eating parasite

22:39.472 --> 22:42.199
from one of her movies.
She's a dedicated actress.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.062
She just wants to do a good job.

22:44.554 --> 22:47.359
Hey. No update on what
that 250k was for,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.882
but I think we found
that bad client

22:49.883 --> 22:51.570
that Duke Jones mentioned.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.384
It's Tonya's husband...
Bill Wellington.

22:54.385 --> 22:56.944
Turns out, Tonya's
wife number three.

22:56.945 --> 22:58.586
Bill divorced the
other two just before

22:58.587 --> 23:00.587
their prenups expired,
leaving them without a dime,

23:00.588 --> 23:02.759
and get this, he was about
to do the same to Tonya.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.530
He filed for a divorce
two months ago.

23:04.531 --> 23:06.720
So that's why Stacey became
more selective with her clients.

23:06.721 --> 23:08.671
She knew Tonya would
be left with nothing.

23:08.672 --> 23:10.272
Not exactly nothing.

23:10.273 --> 23:12.783
The Wellingtons' prenup
has an infidelity clause,

23:12.784 --> 23:14.874
which Bill violated.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.956
He owes Tonya 100 million bucks

23:17.957 --> 23:18.754
for cheating on her.

23:18.755 --> 23:20.705
She even has the boudoir
shots to prove it.

23:20.706 --> 23:23.542
You have the photographs?
From where?

23:23.543 --> 23:25.348
Her divorce file.
Pretty salacious, too.

23:25.349 --> 23:26.963
Can I see?

23:27.062 --> 23:29.778
Castle, we're looking into a murder,
not dirty photos.

23:29.779 --> 23:32.957
Or maybe we can do both.
Look familiar?

23:33.069 --> 23:35.466
That's Chloe...
Duke Jones' assistant.

23:35.467 --> 23:38.437
That 250 grand,
that was a payment to Stacey

23:38.438 --> 23:39.904
to break up Tonya's prenup.

23:39.905 --> 23:42.224
So Stacey hired Duke in order
to get photographic evidence.

23:42.225 --> 23:44.833
Mm-hmm, and Duke's assistant
Chloe here was the bait.

23:44.834 --> 23:47.040
And then they honey
trapped Bill Wellington

23:47.041 --> 23:50.836
to break up the prenup,
costing him $100 million.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.918
Man, if I were him,
I'd be out for blood.

23:55.864 --> 23:57.152
Let's bring him in.

23:59.794 --> 24:00.680
You have copies of that file?

24:00.681 --> 24:02.230
Oh, I copy everything.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.441
Guy looks like a pit bull.

24:06.442 --> 24:07.095
I could see him sticking

24:07.096 --> 24:09.685
someone through a wrought iron fence.
Yeah.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.874
Stacey must have felt
incredibly guilty,

24:11.875 --> 24:14.235
putting Tonya in a
relationship with him.

24:14.681 --> 24:17.087
So she decided to level
the playing field.

24:18.011 --> 24:19.242
Legally, does it
matter to the case

24:19.243 --> 24:22.103
why Stacey did what she did? 
No.

24:22.104 --> 24:22.958
Good afternoon, Mr. Wellington.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.308
But that's what makes Beckett
such a great detective.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.933
She invests in the victim.

24:26.934 --> 24:30.301
I'm investigating the murder of Stacey
Collins. When was the last time you saw her?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.733
You think I did this
to Stacey Collins?

24:32.734 --> 24:34.204
What's my motive?

24:34.205 --> 24:35.707
Because of what she
did to your marriage.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.757
It's not like she put a
gun to my head and said,

24:37.758 --> 24:40.309
"marry the beast." 
Well, that's very big of you, Mr. Wellington.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.004
We also know

24:41.005 --> 24:44.146
that you were having an
affair with this woman.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.653
What does my personal
business got to do

24:46.654 --> 24:48.342
with the murder of Stacey Collins?

24:48.343 --> 24:50.526
I will be asking the questions,
Mr. Wellington.

24:50.527 --> 24:53.780
How did you meet Chloe?
At the bar at Il Mulino.

24:54.521 --> 24:57.413
She liked my watch,
and I liked her eyes.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.388
She had a suite at
the Beaumont Hotel.

24:59.389 --> 25:01.581
It used to be, a guy could
get a little on the side

25:01.582 --> 25:04.374
without worrying about
some moron with a camera

25:04.375 --> 25:07.119
ruining his life.
Expensive affair.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.104
I understand that it
cost you $100 million.

25:10.105 --> 25:12.223
You must have been pretty
angry when you discovered

25:12.224 --> 25:14.764
Stacey Collins engineered
the whole thing

25:14.765 --> 25:16.655
in order to break your prenup.

25:16.656 --> 25:18.460
That bitch did what?
Mr. Wellington...

25:18.461 --> 25:21.453
Are you telling me that this
piece of tail worked for Stacey,

25:21.454 --> 25:23.957
and that Stacey and my
wife arranged all this?

25:23.958 --> 25:25.627
Cost you 100 million bucks.

25:25.628 --> 25:27.470
I've seen people
kill for far less.

25:27.471 --> 25:29.514
Now you listen to me, detective.

25:29.515 --> 25:31.513
I had nothing to do
with that murder,

25:31.514 --> 25:35.387
because had I known, I would've
killed Stacey and Tonya,

25:35.388 --> 25:36.326
both!

25:37.743 --> 25:40.242
Where were you last Sunday night,
Mr. Wellington?

25:40.769 --> 25:42.919
Hong Kong?
He was there for a week.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.970
His jet touched down at
Westchester county airport

25:44.971 --> 25:47.569
yesterday afternoon.
Maybe he hired someone.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.299
We should recheck his financials.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.856
Beckett, just got
back from Duke's.

25:51.857 --> 25:53.833
The entire place is cleaned out.
There's no files,

25:53.834 --> 25:55.812
no computers,
not even a paperclip.

25:55.813 --> 25:57.542
Checked his home address, too.
No sign of him.

25:57.543 --> 25:59.503
He's gone. 
What about our honey trap Chloe?

25:59.504 --> 26:01.786
No Chloe Graves
matching her description

26:01.787 --> 26:02.921
in the Tristate area.

26:02.922 --> 26:05.520
And Stacey's assistant
Julie never heard of her

26:05.521 --> 26:07.224
or Duke or honey trapping.

26:07.225 --> 26:10.448
With her and Duke gone,
there's no way to track 'em down.

26:10.449 --> 26:12.869
So either Stacey's
murder spooked them both

26:12.870 --> 26:13.946
and they got out of dodge or...

26:13.947 --> 26:16.510
Or they killed Stacey and
now they're on the run.

26:21.074 --> 26:23.321
Wellington said Chloe had a
suite at the Beaumont Hotel.

26:23.322 --> 26:24.567
You guys see what you can dig up.

26:24.568 --> 26:27.779
- We'll run background and see
what we can find on Duke. - Right.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.635
Natalie Rhodes? 
Yes.

26:37.737 --> 26:38.673
What did you get?

26:38.674 --> 26:41.110
Oh, just a little something
to help with my research.

26:41.441 --> 26:42.804
Where's the ladies room?

26:42.977 --> 26:45.009
Yeah, over... just by the elevator.

26:45.010 --> 26:46.575
Great. Thanks.

26:47.883 --> 26:49.694
Yeah, I know her. That's Greta.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.400
Greta?
Greta Morgan.

26:51.642 --> 26:53.477
And she stayed here about three
weekends ago. Is that right?

26:53.478 --> 26:55.342
Yes, and checked out last Monday.

26:55.343 --> 26:56.651
2-week stay, huh?

26:56.863 --> 27:00.035
Did you notice anybody with her?
This guy perhaps?

27:00.413 --> 27:03.297
Yeah. Yeah, he met her in
the lobby a couple of times.

27:03.298 --> 27:05.111
She must really be
in big trouble, huh?

27:05.771 --> 27:07.635
Why is that? 
There was a cop here the other day

27:07.636 --> 27:09.375
asking all the same questions.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.189
Duke's assistant Chloe...

27:14.580 --> 27:15.797
Greta Morgan.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.879
Former exotic dancer,

27:16.880 --> 27:19.623
picked up a couple of
times for solicitation...

27:19.624 --> 27:22.618
probation and time served.

27:22.619 --> 27:25.402
Well, it looks like she decided
to go a little more upscale. Hmm.

27:25.403 --> 27:27.323
You know, given how
much Tonya paid Stacey

27:27.324 --> 27:30.758
and how little Stacey paid Duke,
looks like money is our motive.

27:30.759 --> 27:32.903
Maybe. 
A.P.B.s are out on Greta,

27:32.904 --> 27:34.771
and I contacted other
precincts to find out

27:34.772 --> 27:36.949
who else is investigating
her and for what.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.625
Talk to enough people,
something usually shakes out.

27:42.983 --> 27:44.619
Just like I dreamed it.

27:46.237 --> 27:47.787
Wh... Did I say that out loud?

27:47.998 --> 27:51.908
Here you go, Beckett. 
Thanks, Johnson. It's Johnson, isn't it?

27:51.909 --> 27:54.650
It's Velazquez.
And you are not me.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.362
No.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.531
But I'm getting warmer.

28:00.027 --> 28:01.261
You certainly are.

28:01.689 --> 28:04.158
Okay. So the word's out on Greta,

28:04.159 --> 28:06.693
and we're already tracking
Duke's credit cards.

28:06.694 --> 28:10.062
Why don't we just call it a night?
What? But it's still early.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.091
Yeah. Yeah, well,
it's a high-stress job.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.423
And I wouldn't want
anyone to get burnt out.

28:16.260 --> 28:18.785
All right. I'll go
pack up my things.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.167
You cannot tell me
that that is normal.

28:25.168 --> 28:27.242
She's just committed to the role.

28:30.262 --> 28:31.585
You should be flattered.

28:31.590 --> 28:33.504
Yeah. Sure.

28:34.544 --> 28:37.996
Until she steals my boyfriend
and kills me in my sleep.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.262
Let me carry that for you.

28:39.732 --> 28:40.709
Thank you.

28:42.074 --> 28:45.812
Oh, look at me. All dressed up
and no crime to solve. Yeah.

28:46.064 --> 28:48.394
And I had my heart set on
doing research tonight.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.300
Oh.

28:50.376 --> 28:51.540
So what do you think?

28:52.081 --> 28:54.093
Am I everything you
imagined Nikki would be?

28:54.094 --> 28:55.035
Uh-huh.

28:55.879 --> 28:57.197
You know, I read
"Heat Wave" last night.

28:57.198 --> 28:58.077
Really?

28:58.078 --> 29:00.904
You're right. It was so much
better than the screenplay.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.649
I went right out and read
"Naked Heat."

29:02.650 --> 29:04.866
You know, I realized the
character of Jameson Rook

29:04.867 --> 29:06.909
is based on you.
Well, yeah, I guess I drew

29:06.910 --> 29:10.781
on my relationship with detective Beckett.
Even the sex scenes?

29:11.312 --> 29:12.616
No, that was just...

29:12.617 --> 29:14.289
fantasy...

29:14.290 --> 29:16.125
Like me, now?

29:17.524 --> 29:20.011
Well, you... you know,
you want to give the audience

29:20.012 --> 29:21.068
what they want.

29:21.069 --> 29:22.247
Oh, yeah.

29:26.673 --> 29:29.151
You know, the script is
so much about the passion

29:29.152 --> 29:30.741
between Nikki and Rook.

29:31.279 --> 29:33.163
And if I want to
play Nikki right...

29:35.991 --> 29:37.604
I gotta feel that heat.

29:38.206 --> 29:39.321
Natalie, I'm...

29:39.322 --> 29:40.361
Not Natalie.

29:41.882 --> 29:42.829
Nikki.

29:56.041 --> 29:57.104
Good morning, Castle.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.950
Ah, good morning, detective.

30:03.916 --> 30:06.178
Is that for me or for the
fictional version of me?

30:06.179 --> 30:08.608
Or have you already taken
care of her this morning?

30:08.716 --> 30:10.444
What is... what is that
supposed to mean? I...

30:10.445 --> 30:14.356
Jenny! Jenny! Wait. Could...

30:15.236 --> 30:16.407
Excuse me.
Jenny! Could you please...

30:16.408 --> 30:18.266
Sweetie, could we
just talk about this?

30:21.934 --> 30:23.873
I hate you, Kevin Ryan.

30:25.453 --> 30:26.370
Ooh.

30:26.526 --> 30:27.978
That was dramatic.

30:28.854 --> 30:29.906
What happened?

30:30.620 --> 30:33.311
I accidentally left
my phone at home,

30:33.312 --> 30:34.781
and she brought it to me,
and while she was here,

30:34.782 --> 30:38.242
she asked Javier how
darts was last night.

30:38.412 --> 30:41.380
Uh... Oh, your cover story
for going to see her parents.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.633
Oh. You shoulda told me, bro.

30:42.634 --> 30:44.210
She thought you lied to her.

30:44.211 --> 30:47.556
Yeah, and then she found
out I was working with you,

30:47.557 --> 30:50.775
which I hadn't told her.
What's the big deal about that?

30:51.898 --> 30:53.264
You're on my list.

30:53.730 --> 30:54.376
What list?

30:54.377 --> 30:57.814
My list. My... my freebie five.
The... the five celebrities

30:57.815 --> 31:00.444
you could sleep with if
you had the chance to...

31:00.848 --> 31:04.053
And, uh, now she thinks
that last night, that we...

31:04.441 --> 31:07.583
And I-I should probably
stop talking right now.

31:07.584 --> 31:09.367
I should call her
is what I should do.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.421
Excuse me.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.223
Freebie five, huh?

31:13.809 --> 31:15.374
Wonder what number I am?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.287
Why does that not surprise me?

31:18.009 --> 31:19.433
So any update on
our honey trapper?

31:19.434 --> 31:22.059
Uh, yeah. I heard from all
of the other precincts,

31:22.060 --> 31:24.167
and none of the other
cops were looking for

31:24.168 --> 31:27.825
a Chloe Graves/Greta
Morgan at the Beaumont.

31:28.124 --> 31:29.368
Well, someone was.

31:29.701 --> 31:31.273
What about Duke? Any sign of him?

31:31.274 --> 31:34.505
Well, we are looking into his
credit cards and his phone,

31:34.506 --> 31:36.914
but so far, no hits.
Well, maybe not on Duke's cards,

31:36.915 --> 31:38.613
but I just found
something on Greta's.

31:38.614 --> 31:40.739
She put holds on rooms at
two other pricey hotels

31:40.740 --> 31:43.333
within the last week.
The charges were reversed,

31:43.334 --> 31:46.172
and the rooms were ultimately
paid for on another credit card,

31:46.173 --> 31:48.259
a corporate card belonging
to a Stacey Collins,

31:48.260 --> 31:50.758
our victim. 
The last week?

31:50.759 --> 31:51.821
That was long after they'd gotten

31:51.822 --> 31:54.010
the evidence they needed
on Bill Wellington.

31:55.022 --> 31:57.100
They were honey
trapping other men.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.557
So one of the other men
finds out he's being set up.

32:00.558 --> 32:01.516
He follows Greta

32:01.517 --> 32:03.496
from the Beaumont
Hotel back to Stacey.

32:03.497 --> 32:05.574
He confronts her.
They get into an argument.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.865
In a rage, he kills her...
taking her keys to get rid

32:07.866 --> 32:10.812
of any incriminating evidence
of the affair at her office.

32:13.106 --> 32:13.953
Check the other hotels.

32:13.954 --> 32:16.040
Let's see what we can find on Greta. 
Right.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.697
Thanks. I'm gonna check on Ryan.

32:18.698 --> 32:19.603
Great.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.901
Can I ask you a question? 
Sure.

32:28.057 --> 32:29.516
Is Castle gay?

32:31.667 --> 32:34.292
I'm sorry. What? 
No, no.

32:34.293 --> 32:35.145
Then you two are an item,

32:35.146 --> 32:37.218
but you're sworn
to secrecy, right?

32:37.219 --> 32:40.331
No, we are not an item. 
Why?

32:41.455 --> 32:44.816
Last night, I invited
him back to my place.

32:44.820 --> 32:46.851
And he said something
to me I have never heard

32:46.852 --> 32:48.337
from a man before.

32:49.669 --> 32:50.608
What?

32:51.467 --> 32:52.416
No.

32:53.203 --> 32:54.144
No?

32:54.764 --> 32:55.823
I don't get it.

32:56.052 --> 32:57.263
He's into you.

32:57.531 --> 32:59.339
But you're determined not
to give in to these feelings

32:59.340 --> 33:01.143
that you clearly have for him.

33:01.268 --> 33:03.894
So he fantasizes about
you through his writing.

33:03.895 --> 33:05.686
It's literally...
Verbal masturbation.

33:05.687 --> 33:08.687
Wh... Okay, so what does this
all have to do with me?

33:08.688 --> 33:11.243
I am not wearing this
getup for my health.

33:11.485 --> 33:13.422
You're Nikki Heat.
He is Jameson Rook.

33:13.423 --> 33:16.281
I need to sleep with him in the
name of character research.

33:16.282 --> 33:19.751
Can you talk to him? 
And say what?

33:19.752 --> 33:22.071
I don't know. Give him
permission or something.

33:25.748 --> 33:26.936
I need to go...

33:27.595 --> 33:28.655
Over there.

33:41.704 --> 33:42.676
Everything okay?

33:43.826 --> 33:45.375
Do I really do that?

33:46.291 --> 33:48.320
Yes. And it's adorable.

33:48.321 --> 33:51.278
If it's so adorable,
why didn't you sleep with me?

33:52.202 --> 33:53.690
Her me, not "me" me.

33:53.691 --> 33:54.607
Oh.

33:55.469 --> 33:58.259
Well, a fictional
character that I wrote,

33:58.260 --> 34:00.242
based on you,
played by Natalie Rhodes?

34:00.243 --> 34:01.635
That's just...

34:02.142 --> 34:03.380
Way too meta.

34:06.951 --> 34:08.754
We really should have a
code word so we all know

34:08.755 --> 34:10.471
which Beckett to kill when
her clone army attacks.

34:10.472 --> 34:12.231
Unless we make a
preemptive strike.

34:12.232 --> 34:14.661
Mm-hmm. 
Get through to Jenny yet?

34:14.661 --> 34:16.743
Still not picking up.
Not to worry.

34:16.744 --> 34:18.067
You'll be laughing
about it soon enough.

34:18.068 --> 34:20.222
We are. Thanks.

34:20.223 --> 34:23.045
So I've been running through
all Stacey's client files.

34:23.047 --> 34:25.389
Three couples have filed for
divorce within the last month.

34:25.391 --> 34:27.692
Can you believe that?
You marry the love of your life.

34:27.693 --> 34:30.138
Next thing you know, they're
cheating on you with someone... Ryan.

34:31.254 --> 34:34.397
Sorry. Anyways, two of the
guys have rock-solid alibis

34:34.398 --> 34:35.516
for the time of Stacey's murder.

34:35.518 --> 34:38.532
The third divorce had
nothing to do with cheating.

34:40.309 --> 34:41.112
What are you guys doing?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.103
Hiding from creepy Beckett.

34:42.103 --> 34:45.958
Oh. We're not hi... 
Did you find anything on Greta Morgan?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.395
Yeah. I found something
pretty interesting

34:47.396 --> 34:50.889
at the Meritage Hotel. 
What?

34:51.348 --> 34:52.411
Greta Morgan.

34:57.352 --> 35:00.830
I didn't kill her. I told
you where I was that night.

35:00.831 --> 35:02.215
People saw me. 
Doesn't matter.

35:02.216 --> 35:04.750
We already have you on
prostitution and extortion,

35:04.751 --> 35:06.592
so you're looking at ten years.

35:06.593 --> 35:08.400
But if you decide to
help us find the truth,

35:08.401 --> 35:10.823
I might be inspired to
recommend that the D.A.

35:10.824 --> 35:12.823
give you a suspended sentence.

35:15.602 --> 35:16.422
What do you want to know?

35:16.423 --> 35:19.332
Were there any other marks
besides Bill Wellington?

35:20.842 --> 35:22.583
Stacey hated that, because of her,

35:22.584 --> 35:25.693
these women were in
relationships with bad men.

35:25.694 --> 35:26.917
She felt an obligation

35:26.918 --> 35:28.982
to give them a way
out with dignity...

35:28.983 --> 35:32.463
The others. How many were there? 
Two.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.233
I'm gonna need their names.

35:38.025 --> 35:39.437
Their names, Greta.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.378
Now.

35:44.238 --> 35:46.458
Rich Weiss and Scott Donner.

35:50.527 --> 35:53.085
Tall with dark hair...
they both match the description

35:53.086 --> 35:55.205
of the guy who was sniffing
around the Beaumont Hotel.

35:55.206 --> 35:57.130
We talked to both of those guys.

35:57.131 --> 35:58.955
You're saying one of
them might be the killer?

35:58.956 --> 36:00.906
Yeah, but which one did it,
and how do we prove it?

36:00.907 --> 36:03.395
By figuring out which cheater
went home with his wife...

36:03.396 --> 36:06.040
And which one stayed
behind to commit murder.

36:13.727 --> 36:17.713
So it comes to this...
two phone calls to two wives,

36:17.714 --> 36:21.213
one of whom has been sleeping
with a cold-hearted killer.

36:21.521 --> 36:24.092
See, this should totally
be in the movie.

36:24.293 --> 36:26.668
No twisty this,
no melodramatic that.

36:26.669 --> 36:29.178
Ah, people love twisty thises
and melodramatic thats.

36:29.179 --> 36:32.187
They love what's real.
You know, less is more.

36:32.253 --> 36:34.270
The hardest thing to
perform as an actor...

36:34.271 --> 36:35.200
doing nothing,

36:35.501 --> 36:38.385
just being still, being quiet.

36:38.582 --> 36:40.168
Yeah, I'd love to see that.

36:41.070 --> 36:43.691
So... Rich's wife confirms
that after the party,

36:43.692 --> 36:45.491
the two of them
went straight home.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.945
Yes, thank you.

36:48.133 --> 36:50.277
Scott's wife confirmed
that the two of them

36:50.278 --> 36:52.250
went straight home as well.

36:53.933 --> 36:56.237
But then Scott went back out

36:56.238 --> 36:58.284
and met his cousin
Benjamin for a drink.

36:58.285 --> 37:01.275
Only Benjamin doesn't
remember having that drink.

37:01.276 --> 37:03.355
Turns out Scott and his
wife left the party

37:03.356 --> 37:05.618
an hour before Stacey left,
giving him plenty of time

37:05.619 --> 37:08.391
to get back there and follow her.
So what do you say, Natalie,

37:08.392 --> 37:11.478
you want to join us on your first arrest? 
Hell, yeah.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.718
Let's take that
cheating dirtbag down.

37:14.885 --> 37:15.877
Too much?

37:16.877 --> 37:18.837
I-I just usually say, "let's go."

37:18.838 --> 37:20.775
See? Less is more.

37:20.811 --> 37:21.762
Okay.

37:24.765 --> 37:27.002
Mr. Donner,
detective Beckett, NYPD.

37:27.003 --> 37:29.256
We're here about
Stacey Collins' murder.

37:29.428 --> 37:30.131
I don't understand.

37:30.132 --> 37:32.436
I told you everything I
know down at the station.

37:32.437 --> 37:33.587
Yes, but you didn't tell us

37:33.588 --> 37:36.020
where you were when
she was murdered.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.823
We know you weren't
with your wife.

37:37.824 --> 37:40.178
Or with your cousin having a drink.
You lied about that.

37:40.179 --> 37:43.103
So where were you? 
I was...

37:43.104 --> 37:47.137
What did you stand to lose, $30,
$40 million after the divorce?

37:47.138 --> 37:50.387
You confronted Stacey and you
asked her for those photos.

37:50.388 --> 37:53.595
She refused, and then you killed her.
No, no, no, no.

37:53.596 --> 37:56.404
Mr. Donner, you're under arrest for...
No.

37:56.405 --> 37:57.802
Gun! Hey!

37:58.150 --> 37:59.462
You stay back, all of you.

37:59.463 --> 38:01.525
You do not need to do this, Scott.
Give me the gun.

38:01.526 --> 38:04.414
No. I didn't mean to kill her.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.163
I just wanted the pictures.

38:06.190 --> 38:08.138
She tried to break away!

38:08.367 --> 38:10.412
I didn't even see the gate there,

38:10.413 --> 38:14.407
and those spikes. 
Okay, fine. It was an accident.

38:14.408 --> 38:17.504
Oh, what does it matter?
It's all over for me.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.472
Scott, give me the gun,

38:19.473 --> 38:22.358
and I promise you,
you will get a fair trial.

38:22.386 --> 38:25.622
You think I'm fooling around here, detective?
No, I don't.

38:26.251 --> 38:29.215
I think you feel trapped,
and you're serious as hell.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.674
But right now you need to think
about the people who love you.

38:34.418 --> 38:35.894
And they need you...

38:36.457 --> 38:38.477
To put down that gun.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.611
I guess that script
wasn't so hacky after all.

39:06.547 --> 39:08.280
You know, it's tragic, really.

39:08.453 --> 39:10.411
All Stacey wanted was
to help save these women

39:10.412 --> 39:12.414
from getting screwed
in their divorces.

39:12.415 --> 39:14.373
Instead, she winds
up getting killed.

39:14.616 --> 39:17.476
Well, thanks to you, we only
have one death on our hands.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.459
I'm just glad it all worked out.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.366
But I could've used another take.

39:21.367 --> 39:23.810
I should've added a
beat in that last line.

39:23.980 --> 39:26.037
Instead of "put down that gun."

39:26.038 --> 39:30.451
I should've said,
"put down... that gun."

39:30.568 --> 39:32.554
Hear the difference?
Totally adds layers.

39:32.555 --> 39:34.700
Sounded good to me.
Sounded just like me.

39:34.701 --> 39:36.107
Thanks for everything, Kate.

39:36.382 --> 39:38.533
I'll try to do you
and Nikki justice...

39:40.169 --> 39:41.087
Even if I didn't get to do

39:41.088 --> 39:43.526
all the character
research I'd hoped.

39:47.419 --> 39:48.822
Visit me on set, Castle.

39:48.823 --> 39:49.999
I wouldn't miss it.

39:51.887 --> 39:52.833
I wouldn't.

39:54.490 --> 39:55.488
Mm. Natalie Rhodes.

39:55.489 --> 39:58.367
And I thought it was cool
working with you, Castle. Nice.

39:59.961 --> 40:01.879
Hi, guys. Hey. Hey.

40:02.863 --> 40:05.188
Jenny, I am so glad to see you.

40:05.189 --> 40:07.028
Mm. I-I just wanted
to tell you all,

40:07.029 --> 40:10.382
I'm sorry about before.
I-I made a scene.

40:10.383 --> 40:12.394
Jenny, it's okay.

40:12.395 --> 40:15.271
No. You're the best thing

40:15.272 --> 40:17.047
that's ever happened to me, Kevin.

40:17.048 --> 40:20.763
And I want you to know that
I trust you and I love you.

40:20.918 --> 40:21.851
I'm sorry.

40:22.512 --> 40:23.507
No, I...

40:28.541 --> 40:30.656
No, I'm the one who's sorry,
because...

40:30.657 --> 40:32.298
I lied to you.

40:32.322 --> 40:34.432
But I'm gonna set the
record straight right now,

40:34.433 --> 40:37.941
because you deserve the truth,
so wait here just one second.

40:40.323 --> 40:41.067
What is he doing?

40:41.068 --> 40:42.031
Shh.

40:44.532 --> 40:46.858
I didn't play darts

40:46.859 --> 40:48.598
with Javier last night.

40:49.986 --> 40:51.606
I went go see your parents

40:51.825 --> 40:53.767
because I had a question for them.

40:57.605 --> 40:59.694
Jennifer Scout

41:00.050 --> 41:01.566
Duffy-O'Malley...

41:02.467 --> 41:04.483
will you make me the
happiest guy in the world

41:04.484 --> 41:05.615
and marry me?

41:08.045 --> 41:09.027
Oh, my God.

41:09.461 --> 41:12.002
Uh, y-yes. Yes! Yes. 
Yes?

41:14.293 --> 41:15.931
Oh, my gosh. 
That was big.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.440
Oh, and intimate.

41:17.441 --> 41:25.953
* In the power of love *
