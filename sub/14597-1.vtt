# THE MENTAL FACULTY OF STORING PAST
EXPERIENCES AND RECALLING THEM AT WILL #

00:49.756 --> 00:53.330
# 2. THE ACT OF AN INSTANCE
OF REMEMBERING, RECOLLECTRION #

00:53.480 --> 00:58.639
# 3. ALL THAT A PERSON CAN REMEMBER. #

01:38.168 --> 01:40.668
No! No!

02:04.806 --> 02:08.292
As a researcher in the field of
memory loss, I know how daunting

02:08.324 --> 02:11.207
it can be to reach results for
patients with Alzheimer's syndrome.

02:11.904 --> 02:14.404
As someone who's felt the
effects of this disease personally,

02:14.586 --> 02:18.188
I truly understand that
all that matters is life.

02:18.223 --> 02:22.482
And our lives, ladies and gentlemen,
are nothing more than our memories.

02:23.270 --> 02:25.770
Alright, thank you.

02:27.223 --> 02:29.723
I'll be back.

02:30.744 --> 02:34.024
Thought you were over doctors. - I'll be
all over Doctor Mills tonight, trust me.

02:34.258 --> 02:37.658
Yeah, well, I'll be all over my bed. We
got an early start, man, I'm just exhausted.

02:37.659 --> 02:41.952
Don't forget to pack your diapers, little
baby.- Look, while I'm working my ass off,

02:42.120 --> 02:45.094
you're flirting with doctors and
checking on your fantasy football team.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.587
That's why I'm always
in the playoffs, baby!

02:47.588 --> 02:50.908
You think you have problems, try being a
single dad. - What are you talking about?

02:50.909 --> 02:54.029
What I'm talking about? I'm talking
about I haven't had a decent breakthrough

02:54.030 --> 02:56.230
in over a year and a half, alright?
A year and a half.

02:56.720 --> 03:02.100
I'm touring, I'm speaking on what I ask you.
- Taylor make sense.

03:02.632 --> 03:05.832
Listen, you're trying to do something
good for society as well as for your mom.

03:06.538 --> 03:09.038
Trying to cure a disease takes time.

03:09.343 --> 03:12.383
I look at her, right, and I think in
ten years time, that's going to be me.

03:12.430 --> 03:15.870
Pretty soon I'm not even going to recognize
you. - Hey, you don't know that for sure.

03:15.871 --> 03:18.071
You know, I've got a 50%
chance of having Alzheimer's.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.105
Yeah, but you shouldn't
think of it like that.

03:20.106 --> 03:22.830
Come on, you got to live your
life, man! One more shot, Rico!

03:22.885 --> 03:25.385
One more shot, please.

03:27.860 --> 03:31.444
Night Dr. Briggs! You have an
urgent message. It's from the hospital.

03:31.507 --> 03:34.007
Thank you.

03:37.742 --> 03:40.128
I knew you were in
Brazil for the convention.

03:40.129 --> 03:42.797
I am Dr. Costas, Head of
Neurology for the hospital.

03:43.012 --> 03:45.732
We got your message. Got here as
soon as we could, and here we are,

03:45.733 --> 03:47.879
we don't... not
exactly sure as to why.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.520
At first we diagnosed it

03:51.899 --> 03:54.468
as a cerebral hemorrhage.
- Right.

03:55.341 --> 03:57.929
Then the MRis came back.

03:58.336 --> 04:00.575
We've never seen anything like it.
- Really.

04:01.113 --> 04:03.613
Please. Come.

04:04.610 --> 04:07.264
This is Dr. Salvo, the
attending physician.

04:08.241 --> 04:11.663
Who is he?
- We don't know. We think he's American.

04:14.382 --> 04:19.266
What's that on his skin?
- Red ocher. Amazonian Indians up the river,

04:19.951 --> 04:22.328
use it as a tribal body dye.

04:22.329 --> 04:26.617
And how can we help? - If you will just take
a look at these scans, you will understand.

04:33.546 --> 04:35.934
As you can see, the
tumors have formed in...

04:35.935 --> 04:40.296
Which area dealing, with memory?
- We would appreciate your input.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.083
Did he have anything with him?
- Just that.

04:56.237 --> 05:01.689
What is this substance? - I'm not sure.
He had ingested a great deal of that powder.

05:02.831 --> 05:06.674
When he dies, where will the post mortem
be done? - Due to the unknown condition,

05:07.145 --> 05:09.743
the authorities demand that
we cremate him immediately.

05:10.131 --> 05:12.923
I want to say cancer, but I've...

05:14.520 --> 05:20.509
never seen cancer attack
memory centers so selectively.

05:23.796 --> 05:26.734
You ever seen anything like that?
- Never heard of anything like that.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.291
Hey!

06:55.542 --> 06:58.102
Hey!
Stop, would you?

07:10.760 --> 07:13.260
Hey!

07:26.437 --> 07:28.937
Taylor, we're going to
miss this flight, damn it!

07:29.511 --> 07:32.011
What the fuck happened to you?
- I don't know.

07:32.454 --> 07:35.708
You're soaking wet.
- I know. I'm dehydrated.

07:37.806 --> 07:40.541
Did you go out again last night?
- No.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.442
I took a shower.

07:47.982 --> 07:51.614
You bang your head or what?
- God, that all seemed so real.

07:52.091 --> 07:54.591
What was so real?
- I thought I was chasing this guy.

07:54.648 --> 07:58.872
He had a black, Burberry overcoat.
- Burberry. Nice, buddy.

08:04.274 --> 08:06.520
Crap!
- What?

08:06.521 --> 08:08.801
The pow... I'm such and idiot!
The powder, I got that...

08:08.802 --> 08:11.962
It's just... - Fucking powder! - It's
just a rash! - I know man! I got a hole,

08:11.963 --> 08:14.363
We'll miss this flight. - My
club had a rip in it. I got...

08:14.364 --> 08:16.704
Ah shit!
- Come on!

08:27.484 --> 08:30.164
Excuse me, do you know what
happened to the patient that was here?

08:30.165 --> 08:32.265
He die, a few hours ago.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.890
Do you know where Dr. Costas is?
- I'm not sure. I think he's gone.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.222
Thank you.

09:42.077 --> 09:44.419
Hey you.
- Oh, hey!

09:44.420 --> 09:48.613
How's she doing? - Good, she's been smiling
ever since we started watching 'Jerry'.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.495
Started to watch Jerry?
What else did you watch?

09:52.946 --> 09:58.061
Well, we do crocodile hunters at seven.
Then we shop on QBC for about an hour.

09:58.302 --> 10:02.871
Nice. - Carol dropped of another one of
those crazy study things for you. - Crazy.

10:03.468 --> 10:06.588
Okay, I'll see you later. - Drive safe.
#KEEP AN OPEN MIND THIS TIME, CAROL #

10:06.589 --> 10:09.269
Thank you. Bye. #NEW AGE HERBAL
TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER's DESISE #

10:16.445 --> 10:18.945
Got another one for the collection.

10:34.141 --> 10:36.641
It's good to be home.

10:40.647 --> 10:43.147
I missed you Mom.

11:00.823 --> 11:04.639
# TO DO LIST 1) PICK UP SCUBA GEAR
2) DAY CLEANING 3) PRESCRIPTION FOR MOM #

11:22.641 --> 11:25.141
Run a check on that, will you?

12:10.831 --> 12:14.575
Carol?
- Surprise!

12:15.045 --> 12:17.596
Surprise, how are you?

12:18.815 --> 12:21.315
Happy birthday

12:22.416 --> 12:24.916
Happy birthday buddy.

12:25.387 --> 12:29.178
I told you I'd get you.
- Thank you, girl.

12:30.509 --> 12:34.289
Hi everybody. - Have a drink.
- It's exactly what I need.

12:34.950 --> 12:38.227
See ya darling.
- Excuse me. How are you?

12:49.675 --> 12:52.755
Didn't know I had so many friends.
- They just came here for the free booze.

12:53.426 --> 12:55.926
It ain't the art.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.291
You know, I...

13:00.696 --> 13:03.196
I went to see your mother,
while you were gone.

13:03.627 --> 13:05.922
Did you happen to get the
report that I left for you?

13:05.923 --> 13:08.511
I did, but I didn't get
a chance to look at it.

13:10.259 --> 13:13.160
You know, I think that I
finally found someone for you.

13:13.770 --> 13:19.738
Believe it or not, just easy going,
a good listener, and very lonely.

13:20.795 --> 13:23.648
I want you to meet Barb. Barb, Taylor.

13:25.426 --> 13:28.423
Aren't you going to say hi?
- Hi, Barb.

13:28.647 --> 13:32.594
That's right. Now Barb, this gentleman
is going to take care of you from now on,

13:32.747 --> 13:37.773
and I want you to be nice to him, stay with
him and make sure he doesn't get introuble.

13:38.022 --> 13:41.362
Carol, I don't know how to take care
of a fish. - It's not organic chemistry.

13:42.423 --> 13:47.641
Anybody seen Max?
- He's late as usual... excuse me.

13:48.098 --> 13:51.115
I, you, that's, I'm going to...
- Talk to him, talk to him.

13:51.150 --> 13:54.133
Would you like a...
- No, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.479
I just had one. I'm... new friend?
- Thanks for asking.

13:57.861 --> 14:01.021
Do you feel any better?
- Well, yeah... yeah.

14:02.111 --> 14:04.611
No, I just think I had too much
to drink, you know. - Good.

14:05.193 --> 14:07.693
What do you think of those
three artists over there?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.806
Yeah, you know, we'll see.
- Usually I don't mind a little moustache,

14:11.807 --> 14:14.788
but I think that is out of the question.
That's all I've got to say.

14:16.453 --> 14:19.630
What are you two delinquents up to?
- Max, you missed the whole party, buddy.

14:20.288 --> 14:22.788
Hey slick, it wasn't my
birthday, you know what I mean.

14:23.551 --> 14:26.140
But I did have to close a little deal.
- Cubans.

14:27.635 --> 14:32.075
250 a box baby, and I got a box
for you in the car. - I love you Max.

14:32.279 --> 14:35.673
And happy birthday Deep... - Come on now.
I got you a fish. Hope you don't mind.

14:35.674 --> 14:39.264
Hey birthday boy, I got a little something
for you. - No, for me? - Yeah, for you buddy.

14:39.722 --> 14:42.642
And we're going to open this downstairs.
You want to come with us, Deep?

14:43.894 --> 14:48.653
I think I'm going to go check out some art.
- Yeah, right.

14:49.392 --> 14:51.892
Save the two brunettes for me, will ya?

14:53.091 --> 14:57.278
Hey. You want the little cracker and some
cheese? - Yeah, maybe in Carol's office.

14:59.379 --> 15:01.879
This is supposed to be 'Numero Uno'.

15:04.361 --> 15:09.404
It was grown, on the
lushest hill in Bordeaux

15:09.455 --> 15:11.955
by a one-legged man named Pepe.

15:13.298 --> 15:17.647
And it was bottled in 1971,
the year of your birth,

15:19.195 --> 15:22.111
and my marriage,

15:24.391 --> 15:26.891
and Pepe's untimely divorce.

15:28.646 --> 15:31.146
Let it breathe now.

15:32.878 --> 15:35.378
Alright.
- Cheers.

15:43.011 --> 15:46.058
That's kind of weird.
- It's dog shit.

15:47.819 --> 15:50.091
I spent 400 on this garbage.

15:50.092 --> 15:53.000
I'm sorry. Let it breathe a little bit.
- Let it breather nothing.

15:53.063 --> 15:55.563
See if there's any beer in there. God!

15:56.669 --> 15:59.028
In there.

15:59.029 --> 16:02.712
God.
- We're in luck. Two Miller's.

16:03.275 --> 16:06.490
Good, yeah, well. It's Miller time now.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.539
Get this taste out of my mouth.

16:13.025 --> 16:15.525
Oh yeah.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.379
Oh, Taylor...

16:24.852 --> 16:27.352
I'm getting old.

16:28.067 --> 16:32.986
Seems like yesterday, that I was
toasting your arrival with champagne.

16:34.004 --> 16:39.967
It was pretty good stuff too. Your
mom, she'd bring you by to visit.

16:40.718 --> 16:43.218
You're like the son I never had.

16:45.002 --> 16:47.502
Look at you now.

16:48.153 --> 16:50.653
And me.

16:53.723 --> 16:57.642
And that's our future, Taylor
Briggs. Never turns out the way

16:57.786 --> 17:01.913
you think it's going to.
- Well, cheers to that.

17:05.664 --> 17:09.428
Are you going to still help me, move
my Mom's stuff? And buy the beer?

17:09.718 --> 17:12.143
How am I going to move
the stuff if I'm drunk?

17:12.144 --> 17:14.644
Hasn't hurt your golf aim has it?

17:17.326 --> 17:21.476
Well, if I haven't told
you, sport, happy birthday.

18:07.985 --> 18:11.403
# SUNDAY, MARCH 21. 1971 #

18:13.647 --> 18:15.987
Hey!

18:15.988 --> 18:18.488
Wait!

19:42.619 --> 19:46.736
How did he do? - Well, Nick dropped
the ball in the outfield and lost the game.

19:46.782 --> 19:50.098
Oh man, I'm sorry.
- And, you know, I've been working with him,

19:51.335 --> 19:53.835
I don't know.

19:55.908 --> 19:58.166
You look like shit.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.667
Thanks. You're a good friend, Deep.
- Yeah.

20:01.545 --> 20:04.843
Hey little man. - Hey, bud. -
What's up, Taylor? - Nothing.

20:04.844 --> 20:07.584
What do you mean nothing? There's
always got to be something?

20:07.628 --> 20:10.482
Yeah, right, there's something.
- Hey, Nick, check this out.

20:11.394 --> 20:13.894
Yeah, you just build on that.
- You got it.

20:19.946 --> 20:22.411
It happened again.
- What, puberty?

20:22.412 --> 20:24.912
No, I saw the guy in the trench coat.

20:25.418 --> 20:29.118
So, who is this guy? - That's just it,
I don't know, I, I can't see his face.

20:31.144 --> 20:33.744
Taylor, you banged the crap out
of your head in that hotel room.

20:34.617 --> 20:37.257
You know, concussions can cause
memory loss, memory regression,

20:37.308 --> 20:40.297
all kinds of stuff, you know this.
- That's just it, it's not my memory.

20:41.392 --> 20:44.790
He had a newspaper dated
March 21st, 1971, in his car.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.348
Okay, so why is this guy walking
around with an old newspaper?

20:49.514 --> 20:53.186
It wasn't old at the time.
- Let me get this straight.

20:54.007 --> 20:57.247
You're telling me you're seeing things
that happened a year prior to your birth.

20:57.791 --> 21:00.291
Why are you treating this so seriously?

21:03.023 --> 21:05.523
Just humor me, will you?
Test the powder.

21:44.259 --> 21:49.401
Tulane University's Masters thesis.
"Dreaming with the Dead", William Terrel.

21:51.471 --> 21:55.655
Part of an ancient worldwide religion,
red ocher was used as a body dye by man

21:55.779 --> 21:58.428
and his ancestors for
almost two million years.

21:58.970 --> 22:01.808
As a geneticist, I intend
on traveling to Brazil.

22:04.430 --> 22:08.017
Amazonian Indians are the last to
practice this once universal ceremony.

22:11.552 --> 22:15.270
Covered in red ocher, they are branded with
a symbol before they ingest sacred powder.

22:19.518 --> 22:23.103
As they claim to see through
the eyes of their dead ancestors.

23:25.266 --> 23:28.795
You should have discovered here, is that
we're not really drawing this scene at all.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.053
But merely trying to capture
the light it's giving off.

23:34.411 --> 23:39.323
The object is always an illusion.
Okay? We'll continue this next week.

23:41.570 --> 23:43.818
Stephanie Jacobs?
- What can I do for you?

23:43.819 --> 23:46.107
My name is Taylor Briggs. Hi.

23:46.108 --> 23:49.199
I'm interested in buying one of
your paintings. - You buy a lot of art,

23:49.431 --> 23:51.931
Taylor Briggs?
- Only the good stuff.

23:54.427 --> 23:57.698
Great work this week.
Do you buy hot chocolate?

23:59.964 --> 24:04.046
I graduated Med School 10 years ago.
- So, go on.

24:05.043 --> 24:07.832
And then I decided, I didn't
want to be a doctor, at all.

24:09.403 --> 24:12.545
You sound more confused than I am.
- Well, I knew I didn't want to work

24:12.612 --> 24:15.918
for the HMOs or the insurance companies,
because they don't give two shits

24:15.975 --> 24:20.349
about helping people. And I finished
my residency and became a researcher.

24:21.748 --> 24:24.248
What do you research?
- Alzheimer's Syndrome.

24:33.268 --> 24:35.768
So, you like the painting
of the man in the coat?

24:37.067 --> 24:40.443
What makes you say that? - It's my
only painting on the market right now.

24:42.085 --> 24:44.585
Right.

24:46.353 --> 24:49.381
What made you... What made
you create it? - I don't know,

24:49.537 --> 24:52.262
I came home one day and it
just sort of, painted itself.

24:54.879 --> 24:58.916
Do you sell a lot of paintings?
- No, not many.

25:00.338 --> 25:03.529
I mostly teach, which is, actually
what I have to do right now.

25:04.821 --> 25:07.321
Bye, Doctor Briggs.
- Goodbye.

25:13.181 --> 25:17.544
It's sand, but I want to
be sure. So I smoked it.

25:20.247 --> 25:22.600
Cute. Appreciate it.

25:22.601 --> 25:26.354
Taylor, it's sand, and 4
percent ground up cerebral tissue.

25:26.692 --> 25:30.453
Great. Brain.
- Yeah, yeah, I found traces of melatonin,

25:30.511 --> 25:32.990
which is only from the pineal gland.
- Pineal?

25:32.991 --> 25:36.471
Yeah, it's just trace amounts, okay. I even
ran some samples, on some of the lab rats.

25:37.124 --> 25:38.928
Came back as nothing. It had no effect.

25:38.929 --> 25:40.849
What am I seeing,
a fucking fantasy world here?

25:40.942 --> 25:43.442
You have another theory?
- You know that patient in Brazil,

25:44.125 --> 25:46.625
he was an American geneticist
named William Terrel.

25:47.314 --> 25:49.648
He was doing a study of
a remote tribe of Indians,

25:49.649 --> 25:53.416
that were engaged in this ancient ceremony
that dates back almost two million years.

25:53.786 --> 25:58.783
It involves ingesting sacred powder.
I think Terrel, I think he stole it.

25:59.095 --> 26:01.768
And the guy got exposed to it,
and my goddamn glove ripped.

26:03.088 --> 26:08.395
The crazy part is this, these Indians, and
they could let you see through the eyes

26:08.514 --> 26:12.924
of your dead ancestors. They
can see things, and images,

26:13.637 --> 26:15.864
that happened before you were born.
- Are you serious?

26:15.865 --> 26:20.138
You're spouting mystic mumbo-jumbo. The
lab rats showed no changes. It's nothing.

26:20.439 --> 26:22.939
What am I supposed to do?
- Go get laid.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.378
Actually, I met a girl the
other day. She's an artist.

26:28.016 --> 26:30.239
Really, I thought you didn't go for that.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.740
And she's no ordinary artist.
- Does she paint naked?

26:33.478 --> 26:36.932
You're an idiot. She did this painting,
I liked it, she was all business though,

26:36.978 --> 26:40.612
she blew me off.
- See. That's why you like her.

26:41.202 --> 26:45.782
That about covers it, so thank you, for
everything, and we'll see you all tomorrow.

26:58.636 --> 27:02.215
The pineal gland is actually the
ancient remains of a primordial eye,

27:02.270 --> 27:04.770
pointing straight up out of the head.

27:07.752 --> 27:13.621
Pineal gland also creates DMT, the most
powerful hallucinogenic known to science.

27:18.969 --> 27:24.517
DMT is often attributed to the out-of-body
experiences in near death situations.

27:38.207 --> 27:40.707
Gee... Jesus!
- Sorry.

27:40.843 --> 27:45.344
Sorry about that. Run out of ideas?

27:47.502 --> 27:50.002
And you came all the way
over here to ask me that?

27:50.179 --> 27:55.402
No, you scared me. I was improvising.
- So what did you come over here for?

27:56.800 --> 28:01.175
Well, you know when H-2-0
cools to a certain temperature,

28:01.233 --> 28:04.226
it forms this solid, called...
- Ice.

28:04.572 --> 28:08.121
That's it. And, you know sometimes
people like to strap blades,

28:08.715 --> 28:12.620
to the bottoms of their feet and
glide across it. So, you know,

28:12.921 --> 28:18.062
I was wondering, if, well,
do you like having fun?

28:20.939 --> 28:23.521
It's funny, I used to come
here all the time when I was a kid.

28:24.159 --> 28:27.561
This is an abandoned building.
When was the last time you skated?

28:29.452 --> 28:33.138
I have to admit, it's been a while.
- Well, it's probably better this way.

28:33.989 --> 28:37.429
Skating's not my forte.
- Yeah, well what did you do as a kid?

28:38.433 --> 28:41.871
Not much. - You didn't skate, you
didn't swim, or anything? - No,

28:41.926 --> 28:46.170
I nearly drowned when I as little. -
That would put a damper on things? - Yeah.

28:46.835 --> 28:51.616
I was sick for a long time. But,
being cooped up inside all the time,

28:51.656 --> 28:54.092
got me into art. So...

28:56.083 --> 28:58.658
Yeah. This place is over.

28:59.528 --> 29:02.463
Well this, this was a unique experience.

29:03.133 --> 29:05.598
I don't really hang out in
condemned buildings much.

29:05.633 --> 29:08.509
Well, give me a couple of days,
I could top that. - Try me.

29:16.330 --> 29:19.530
Let me give you a hand with that.
- Taylor, we're running out of space in here.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.340
Max and I are going to move your
stuff this weekend, don't worry.

29:22.341 --> 29:24.381
Hall closet, hall closet.
- Thanks, Nurse Ratched.

29:54.487 --> 29:56.987
Mom.

30:02.277 --> 30:04.777
The three mountain peaks?

30:08.995 --> 30:12.478
# LAKE SARAWAC, N. H. 1971 #

31:35.642 --> 31:38.142
# NO TRESSPASSING LAKE SARAWAK
WATERSHED PROJECT 1982 #

32:09.326 --> 32:11.826
Why is it clearing?

33:08.586 --> 33:11.302
Damn it! Fucking keys!

33:20.927 --> 33:23.427
Come on.

33:31.072 --> 33:33.351
Taylor, it's a coincidence.

33:33.352 --> 33:36.770
Come on, there's a freezer right
where I remember it being 30 years ago.

33:38.111 --> 33:40.862
Yeah, but you saw it in
a clearing, not in a lake.

33:44.568 --> 33:48.107
That was three decades ago man,
the lake would have changed by then.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.960
Come on. You still dating this
off a newspaper from a dream?

33:52.215 --> 33:55.789
I found the exact place from my
dream, just like I remembered it,

33:55.833 --> 33:59.091
it had a lake, it had trees,
it had three mountain peaks.

33:59.333 --> 34:02.098
All because you saw a photo
of your mom up there in '71?

34:02.580 --> 34:04.921
I mean, it's plausible she
took you up there as a kid

34:04.922 --> 34:07.422
and maybe the memories sat
dormant in your subconscious.

34:07.594 --> 34:10.166
Maybe that's why you see
yourself in these visions. - No.

34:11.230 --> 34:14.835
Fine. Then give me a rational
explanation as to how you can see things,

34:14.931 --> 34:18.013
that ever happened, before
you were even born. - I can't.

34:20.092 --> 34:24.661
So, how's the artist doing?
- Steph? She's good. Thanks.

34:25.232 --> 34:29.197
Coming to the Wednesday dinner. - She's
going to a Wednesday dinner? - Yeah.

34:29.303 --> 34:31.223
You're going to introduce
her to Max before me?

34:31.224 --> 34:32.829
You know, I got to break her in slowly.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.268
I want to make sure she likes
me before I introduce her to you.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.176
Steph, this is my Mom's friend, Carol.
- How nice to meet you.

34:41.255 --> 34:43.755
Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you look familiar.

34:44.366 --> 34:47.858
Well, I'm a painter.
- Maybe I saw you at an opening.

34:48.254 --> 34:51.210
Yeah, probably. You know, I've heard
of your gallery. - Well, good.

34:51.346 --> 34:54.563
You know, Steph did a painting
of a man in a trench coat,

34:54.706 --> 34:59.064
I thought it was really interesting, and,
I stalked her and made her go out with me.

34:59.337 --> 35:03.011
Yes, he did.
- I'd love to see your work sometime.

35:03.252 --> 35:06.910
Sure, anytime. So,
is Max a great cook?

35:07.954 --> 35:12.630
I wouldn't really use
that word... great,

35:12.700 --> 35:15.713
I mean it's, - Burnt. -
more like burnt, yes, burnt.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.923
How do you guys all know each other?
- I met Alicia, that's Taylor's mother,

35:21.723 --> 35:25.554
at Mass General, where she trained with Max.
- You're a doctor as well?

35:25.786 --> 35:29.140
No, no, no, no. I went there
to get stitched up one time.

35:29.341 --> 35:33.016
And Alicia took care of me,
and we've been friends ever since.

35:36.989 --> 35:41.718
How's the food? - It's going to be great.
I picked up some choice chops at the store.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.377
Stephanie.
- Max.

35:44.378 --> 35:47.496
Taylor's been very evasive
about you to all of us.

35:47.765 --> 35:51.731
Now I'm going to want a full report
and I'm willing to share information.

35:52.405 --> 35:54.952
Well, Max, I think
we're going to have to talk.

35:55.312 --> 36:00.120
My two loves were medicine and Jenny.
I miss her more than life itself.

36:00.823 --> 36:03.236
Of course she could get
under my skin like nobody...

36:03.237 --> 36:05.737
I like the painting.
- Oh yeah?

36:07.099 --> 36:10.379
She always wanted to be an astronaut.That's
why I had that made for her birthday,

36:10.908 --> 36:15.905
years ago, it's been up there so long, I
never even thought about taking it down now

36:18.256 --> 36:22.739
So, how are the chops?
- Well done.

36:22.897 --> 36:25.374
No, no, no, that's
blackened Cajun-style.

36:25.936 --> 36:29.636
Now, no one can resist lamb chops a la Max.

36:31.403 --> 36:37.098
Hey, you watch it now. Both of you.
- So are you going to brief me on Taylor here?

36:37.174 --> 36:40.534
Listen, I got the whole story on him, right
in the living room. - No, no, you know,

36:40.535 --> 36:43.815
I think it's getting a little late. I
think we should be going. It's the traffic.

36:43.816 --> 36:46.032
No problem, no problem, we'll see you later.
- Thanks.

36:48.264 --> 36:51.275
Get in there brother, get in there.
- You're evil.

36:51.891 --> 36:55.324
Come on, skip that for tonight.
- You know I don't like a mess,

36:56.203 --> 37:01.806
in anybody's house. Come on. - You know
my new screening room, it's got everything.

37:03.672 --> 37:06.001
I just don't know how to turn it on.

37:06.002 --> 37:11.018
Nope. Got to be this,

37:13.614 --> 37:16.114
Alright, there we go.

37:20.202 --> 37:23.022
Which one are you? - I'm the
one scoring the touchdown, naturally.

37:23.893 --> 37:28.498
That's me, in my stud days.
- Look how young Carol and Mom were.

37:31.010 --> 37:33.730
You can see we're a bunch of show-
boaters. - Yeah, I can see that.

37:35.349 --> 37:37.849
I'm going to fast forward.

37:38.843 --> 37:42.373
It took us about two months
to talk his mom into this deal.

37:46.187 --> 37:51.171
That took all of about 5 seconds.
And it took, well I had to listen

37:51.231 --> 37:55.910
to his mom for the next 5 years about
it. That was back when Taylor's mom

37:55.987 --> 37:58.487
and I worked at Mass General Hospital.

38:00.865 --> 38:03.365
That's Carol.

38:08.033 --> 38:10.533
Is that you and your mom?

38:18.152 --> 38:20.652
Yeah, me and my Jenny.

38:30.146 --> 38:32.976
I can see they're kind of
like parents to you. - Yeah.

38:35.040 --> 38:39.534
So, where are your parents?
- That. My mother is here in Boston

38:40.096 --> 38:43.001
and as for my father, I never
knew him. He died before I was born.

38:44.161 --> 38:46.661
I know what that is like. I was adopted.

38:50.909 --> 38:55.458
Well, Taylor Briggs, it's a...
chilly night.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.368
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.

39:10.048 --> 39:13.993
Barb... how's the water temperature?

39:18.508 --> 39:21.008
Is that better?

40:35.579 --> 40:38.079
1971.

40:46.841 --> 40:49.341
Five year old Allison Frost
perished with her father.

40:49.959 --> 40:52.459
The burning vehicle collided with a tree.

41:05.268 --> 41:09.043
# A PHOTO OF ALLISON FROST TAKEN
ONE WEEK BEFORE THE ACCIDENT #

41:39.895 --> 41:43.135
Taylor, what do you want me to say? You're
telling me there's some guy out there

41:43.186 --> 41:45.685
kidnapping little girls,
before we were even born?

41:45.743 --> 41:48.211
Yeah, well, all the facts
are coming together. - Facts?

41:48.212 --> 41:51.119
Allison Frost died in a car
accident. Her body was found,

41:51.256 --> 41:55.374
ID'ed and buried. Facts.
- Fact. I saw her, March 21st, 1971.

41:55.511 --> 41:58.896
One, she was alive.
Two, her tooth had grown in

41:59.916 --> 42:02.571
Which proves she didn't die
in a goddamn car accident.

42:02.633 --> 42:05.945
Taylor, you're refuting documented
news articles with your own dreams?

42:06.011 --> 42:08.609
I found her. I pulled her name
on the internet. She exists!

42:12.465 --> 42:16.030
Jessica Arnold. I just pulled her out of
thin air. I even thought she'd be brunette.

42:16.638 --> 42:19.138
Come on.
- Paula James.

42:19.613 --> 42:22.413
Maybe you saw a picture of her and
your mind just filled in the gaps.

42:23.780 --> 42:27.172
Paula James.
- She's hot.

42:28.849 --> 42:32.294
Oh shit man, come on!
I'm not making this up!

42:33.380 --> 42:35.880
What I'm feeling is
fucking real, I don't care.

42:38.210 --> 42:40.710
Close the door behind you.

42:50.584 --> 42:55.429
We've got to get you out of here.
Beautiful sunshine, it's good for you.

42:55.976 --> 43:00.068
Yeah. Did you hear me?

43:00.734 --> 43:03.975
Totally fucked!
- Just can't find a good hot dog these days.

43:06.243 --> 43:10.192
See the big, red light that's up there.
You got your on, you got your off.

43:10.743 --> 43:14.090
Channel, volume, give it a hit.

43:14.643 --> 43:17.143
Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:22.136 --> 43:24.636
Hello.

43:30.196 --> 43:34.314
This is, really good.
- Yeah, it's my first.

43:35.579 --> 43:39.509
I got it, don't I?
- Yeah, I have to admit, you've got talent.

43:39.705 --> 43:41.938
Thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable.

43:42.388 --> 43:45.321
I'm kind of busy here.
- Take your time, smells good.

43:46.251 --> 43:48.751
Hello. That wasn't there, was it?

43:49.278 --> 43:51.778
Watch it.
- Sorry.

43:53.517 --> 43:57.120
Do you live here alone?
- Yeah, I like space.

44:05.363 --> 44:08.748
Is that original, Stephanie Jacobs?
- Yeah.

44:09.986 --> 44:12.486
It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

44:19.982 --> 44:22.482
I hope you're hungry.

44:34.426 --> 44:37.026
Oh God, you'd be perfect if you
drank beer and played poker too.

44:41.392 --> 44:44.198
I only play high stakes.
- I got no problem with that.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.100
This is going to hurt.

45:03.519 --> 45:07.619
I feel like I'm back.
- Forget the comeback. Take it off.

45:16.844 --> 45:19.844
Is this what you want to see?
- You're the one who wanted the high stakes.

45:20.552 --> 45:23.052
At least I know I'm going to bed a winner.

45:26.548 --> 45:29.048
Well...

45:35.003 --> 45:37.503
I'm going to bed naked.

45:46.187 --> 45:49.850
So, when do I meet the family?
- You're a bad one,

45:49.971 --> 45:52.471
I'm not taking you home to meet them.
- What?

45:52.904 --> 45:58.264
Besides, they're retired and travel a lot.
- I'll show them a few magic tricks.

45:58.859 --> 46:02.275
Yeah, they're not into magic. - Alright,
then I'll get in good with the brother.

46:03.018 --> 46:06.018
Brother's overseas in the military.
- Then I'll get in good with the dog.

46:06.212 --> 46:08.712
Dog's dead.
- Then I'm fucked.

46:11.283 --> 46:13.283
You know what, I'm thirsty,
how about some water?

46:13.284 --> 46:14.995
That's a good idea, that sounds great.

46:17.591 --> 46:20.091
I'll get that.

46:59.501 --> 47:03.108
The last couple of times were great.- Daddy,
I don't like it here as much though.

47:03.175 --> 47:06.929
The water's too cold. - We're lucky
to be in here after hours at all, okay.

47:36.309 --> 47:38.809
Daddy?

47:41.652 --> 47:44.152
Dad! Daddy! Dad, help me!

47:44.740 --> 47:47.240
Dad! No!

47:52.940 --> 47:55.440
Somebody help me! Daddy!

47:56.800 --> 47:59.300
Daddy, why won't you help me!

48:04.269 --> 48:06.769
Daddy!

48:06.873 --> 48:09.373
Taylor. Taylor.

48:11.038 --> 48:13.851
It wasn't Allison Frost this
time. It was a different girl.

48:14.788 --> 48:17.288
It's crazy, I kind of became him.

48:17.935 --> 48:20.435
Goddamn it, it felt like he was...

48:22.530 --> 48:25.074
He knows what he's doing is wrong, and he,

48:26.430 --> 48:28.791
will do anything to try to stop it, and...

48:31.699 --> 48:34.617
it's as if he's lost something
that he's trying to get back.

48:35.656 --> 48:38.983
What's he lost?
- A child maybe.

48:40.656 --> 48:43.918
I saw him kidnap a little girl in the
locker room and he started some fire and,

48:46.382 --> 48:48.904
Oh God. I'm the date
from hell, I'm sorry.

48:53.229 --> 48:55.729
This happened recently?

48:56.040 --> 48:58.540
This happened over 30 years ago.

49:03.672 --> 49:06.478
There's more.
- What?

49:11.148 --> 49:13.648
He looks like the figure in your painting.

49:17.352 --> 49:19.967
Why didn't you tell me this before?
- It sounded so nuts.

49:22.033 --> 49:24.533
How could I?

49:30.400 --> 49:32.900
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

49:37.230 --> 49:41.441
# OVERCOAT SYRINGE KIT
SPOTLIGHT BLACKGLOVES #

49:42.142 --> 49:45.651
Hello? - Check your e-mail. I
researched your locker room story.

49:53.753 --> 49:56.253
Three die in fire at community college.

50:01.018 --> 50:04.282
Lisa Mullins, her father and an
unidentified second child perished.

50:06.872 --> 50:11.338
This is her. - But you didn't say anything
about a second child in the janitor's closet.

50:13.194 --> 50:17.098
I don't know, but this is the girl.
- The other little girl was never identified.

50:17.288 --> 50:20.171
You sure about this?
- I'm not sure about anything,

50:20.197 --> 50:23.076
but is this community college still around?

51:08.736 --> 51:11.236
He brought another body, in a bag,

51:12.625 --> 51:15.125
that he had over there.
- You sure?

51:15.865 --> 51:19.720
Gas tanks here, gas
tanks. To start a fire.

51:23.952 --> 51:26.452
It started prematurely.

51:26.783 --> 51:29.283
Oh God, this stuff is real, isn't it?
- Yeah.

51:31.324 --> 51:33.824
Let's get out of here.
- In a minute.

51:33.912 --> 51:36.412
Taylor, please.

51:40.304 --> 51:42.537
I know what the second body is for.
- Yeah.

51:43.563 --> 51:46.220
What if, every time he takes a little girl,

51:46.776 --> 51:49.276
he leaves a surrogate body in her place.

51:49.536 --> 51:51.896
Somebody's going to notice
the corpse isn't the same girl.

51:51.897 --> 51:55.446
Not if it's burnt beyond recognition,
and the dental records are inconclusive,

51:55.587 --> 51:57.360
They didn't have DNA testing then.

51:57.361 --> 51:59.201
Yeah, but Taylor, he didn't take Lisa Mullins.

51:59.227 --> 52:04.426
Exactly. The fire, it startedprematurely,
and he didn't have time to switch bodies,

52:04.627 --> 52:07.787
that's why he found Lisa's dad, Lisa
and another body meant to replace her.

52:09.965 --> 52:12.465
So you think he switched a
body for Allison Frost too?

52:15.495 --> 52:19.207
No one ever saw that car hit the tree.
No one ever saw that fire break out.

52:21.045 --> 52:24.506
All they found was a burnt car, burnt
bodies. We have no idea what happened then.

52:25.437 --> 52:29.207
Finding a girl replacement is not
easy. - God, what if he's switching...

52:30.524 --> 52:32.912
What if he's switching the
last ones with the next.

52:32.913 --> 52:37.563
Look, Taylor, this is irrelevant. If
this stuff happened over 30 years ago,

52:37.610 --> 52:40.110
isn't it too late to help them now?

52:57.949 --> 53:00.449
Photo download complete.

53:25.892 --> 53:28.607
Son of a bitch. You're still alive.

53:30.717 --> 53:33.217
What have you been doing all this time?

53:42.870 --> 53:46.407
Elementary school... Carmen
Flaherty burned to death...

53:54.679 --> 53:57.179
Olivia Vazquez, house fire.

54:00.250 --> 54:03.105
Bonnie McHale, burned
to death in a forest fire.

54:08.331 --> 54:11.497
Taylor Briggs.
- You're in a good mood.

54:12.459 --> 54:15.311
Yeah, well, to be honest, I've
been hanging out with this girl

54:15.377 --> 54:17.605
that I met at your birthday party.
- Really?

54:17.606 --> 54:20.106
Yeah, she's pretty cool.
What are you doing here?

54:20.687 --> 54:23.087
You're going to kill me.
I'm going to need a favor. - What?

54:23.088 --> 54:26.556
I need some old coroner's reports.
- You want fries with that too?

54:28.497 --> 54:33.078
I just need 3 files, okay? I'm sure that
you can get them through the med school.

54:34.709 --> 54:37.869
Look, I'll do it this time, okay, but
you are really starting to creep me out.

54:38.094 --> 54:41.876
Come in for some tests. - Do it.
I'll be in. - Deal. - Thank you.

54:43.810 --> 54:47.261
Between an accordion and an onion? - I
don't know. What's the difference between...

54:47.338 --> 54:49.789
accordion and an onion?
- An accordion and an onion?

54:49.790 --> 54:55.368
Nobody cries when you cut up an accordion.
- You find that really funny?

54:56.064 --> 54:58.948
No!
- It's a sympathy laugh.

55:10.490 --> 55:12.990
# HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE DOING #

55:19.178 --> 55:21.905
The only body that was
unrecognizable, was Bonnie McHale.

55:22.430 --> 55:25.710
What happened to her? - Missing on a scout
trip in New Hampshire four months ago.

55:25.866 --> 55:28.226
Look at this, a fire breaks
out, the only thing they find,

55:28.227 --> 55:32.231
are the unrecognizable remains of
Bonnie McHale. He took her. I know it.

55:34.487 --> 55:36.999
It's just like he did with
Allison and Lisa back in '71.

55:40.809 --> 55:43.309
Hello?

55:43.929 --> 55:46.136
Be right over.

55:46.137 --> 55:48.688
Some of the advanced lab
works came back on the powder.

55:49.967 --> 55:53.390
We found traces of
di-methyltryptamine. - Di-methyl what?

55:54.153 --> 55:57.749
DMT, it's one of the most
powerful hallucinogenics known,

55:58.420 --> 56:01.713
it's created in the pineal gland secreted
in the brain at the point of death.

56:02.158 --> 56:04.658
It's thought that it might
numb the experience of death.

56:06.011 --> 56:09.253
Do you remember the rats
I gave the samples to? - Yeah.

56:09.403 --> 56:12.403
One of them turned out to be pregnant.
Now we didn't think anything of it,

56:12.944 --> 56:15.444
until one of the babies got in here.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.811
Those are the two babies.

56:24.812 --> 56:27.734
How many times has he done that?
- This is his first.

56:28.928 --> 56:31.428
He's never done this before?
- No, but his mother has.

56:32.172 --> 56:34.672
How long did it take for her to learn?
- 3 months.

56:34.852 --> 56:37.652
What are you saying? - I wish
I had some more of this powder to test.

56:38.048 --> 56:43.380
But it's all gone. All I can say now,
is that it appears that the powder

56:43.451 --> 56:47.634
has given this litter of rats,
their mother's memories of this maze.

56:48.019 --> 56:50.824
How could memories be
transferred between organisms?

56:51.946 --> 56:54.446
This powder is lighting up
the same primordial areas,

56:55.136 --> 56:57.700
stuff dealing with instincts
and long-term memories.

57:00.271 --> 57:04.045
You know, the only thing is, how can
memories be passed from a parent to a child?

57:04.414 --> 57:06.914
Deep, you remember
the human genome project?

57:07.751 --> 57:11.181
95 percent of our DNA serves
no purpose in our life function. - So?

57:11.441 --> 57:16.079
So, what if our genes stored
the memories of our parents,

57:16.809 --> 57:21.194
right up the point of birth. What if the
DNA link is severed right at that point?

57:21.670 --> 57:23.910
Taylor, I don't know what to tell you.
- Wait a minute.

57:24.312 --> 57:27.512
These memories would have to come from...
- Someone with a direct genetic link,

57:27.513 --> 57:30.538
like a mother, or a father.

57:34.831 --> 57:39.225
My Mom's personal stuff. I don't know
why she didn't put these photos in albums.

57:59.216 --> 58:01.941
I've never seen her
shout at my father before.

58:11.503 --> 58:15.515
How many scout clubs hike up
in those mountains? - What?

58:19.070 --> 58:22.848
If he kidnapped Bonnie McHale, then
he knew she was going to be out there.

58:27.114 --> 58:30.557
He knew her.
- Wait, where are you going?

58:33.851 --> 58:36.351
Come on Ricky, we're going
to be late, let's go, buddy.

58:37.002 --> 58:41.692
This is really messed up. Don't
you think this is a little too far?

58:42.618 --> 58:45.118
Call me on the cell
phone, if they get back.

59:41.641 --> 59:44.141
Funeral service?

01:00:29.508 --> 01:00:32.008
Princess B1 is now online.

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:38.189
Message received from Leizfak.
#LEAVE IT ALONE TAYLOR #

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.914
Shit! Oh, Goddamn it!

01:00:53.352 --> 01:00:56.822
# I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE #

01:00:59.218 --> 01:01:01.718
Damn it.

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:39.290
You dying Taylor?
- Never better.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:42.578
Nick, give Dad a minute, okay?
- Okay.

01:02:43.444 --> 01:02:45.944
See you sport.

01:02:48.276 --> 01:02:51.076
What's happening? - You went into
a seizure. Steph brought you in.

01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:53.706
You've been here all night.
- Am I okay?

01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:57.634
I ran an MRI scan.

01:03:02.955 --> 01:03:06.872
Oh great, I'm going to end up like Terrel.
- Slow down, the anomalies are still small.

01:03:07.002 --> 01:03:09.502
And you only touched it that once, right?
- Yeah, just once.

01:03:09.713 --> 01:03:12.273
Okay, so I think you'll be fine,
but you need to get some rest.

01:03:12.274 --> 01:03:14.938
DMT is dangerous.
- No, you need to get me out of here.

01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:18.206
Taylor, I can't release you..
- You get me out of here, goddamn it.

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:21.770
Deep, I know what I'm seeing right now, I
don't care if I walk out of here bare-ass,

01:03:21.771 --> 01:03:25.371
you're going to get me the hell out of here.
- But what you're seeing doesn't make sense.

01:03:25.372 --> 01:03:28.132
Out of all a person could remember,
why are you seeing these things?

01:03:28.533 --> 01:03:31.653
Will you tell him to take it easy,
alright, he's not listening to me anymore.

01:03:33.914 --> 01:03:37.886
My earliest memory is burning my
finger on a sparkler on the 4th of July.

01:03:38.246 --> 01:03:41.893
What's yours? - Getting a tube shoved down
my throat in the hospital, when I was sick.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:45.683
Okay, trauma, right,
regret. I'm seeing his regrets.

01:03:45.745 --> 01:03:48.807
Why regrets?
- Because regrets, the highs, the lows,

01:03:48.969 --> 01:03:51.469
these are the only things
we remember from our lives.

01:03:52.054 --> 01:03:55.534
It's the only thing that would be passed on
from organism to offspring, don't you see?

01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:58.338
What did you see this time?
- I saw Allison again.

01:03:59.907 --> 01:04:04.209
I took her to a shack in the woods
and made a cast impression of her face.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.319
Is he in love with them?
- It's like they're his children,

01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:12.476
no, it's not sexual, it's
more like a parent's love.

01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:15.312
It's like he's trying to help them.
- He's trying to help them?

01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:18.180
He's keeping them in
fridges. Let's go to the cops.

01:04:18.295 --> 01:04:20.808
To tell them what, that I'm
getting all this from a dream.

01:04:20.866 --> 01:04:23.546
They wouldn't believe me.
- It's better than breaking into houses.

01:04:50.677 --> 01:04:53.305
You scared the shit out of me.
- You scared the shit out of you.

01:04:53.805 --> 01:04:56.070
The side door is open.
Anybody could be in here.

01:04:56.071 --> 01:05:00.102
You know, I came to see Alicia,
and this place was a mess.

01:05:00.112 --> 01:05:02.392
I wasn't really expecting
company, Carol, you know.

01:05:02.393 --> 01:05:04.893
You haven't thrown out
the garbage in three days.

01:05:05.497 --> 01:05:07.997
Oh, hi Stephanie.
- Hi.

01:05:08.835 --> 01:05:11.929
You know, I would love to
drop by and see your work.

01:05:12.319 --> 01:05:16.769
I work out of my loft on
Berry, so anytime you... - Great.

01:05:23.115 --> 01:05:26.651
Carol, there's something I want to ask you.
- Sure.

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:33.598
Is there anything you can tell me
about my Father? - What's this all about?

01:05:34.118 --> 01:05:37.822
You know those, all those alternative
journals you've been giving me,

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:40.392
with the past life regressions and the...
- Yes... Yes.

01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:45.516
...channeling whoever, well,
have you ever, come across something

01:05:45.569 --> 01:05:50.872
that has to do with seeing
your parents' memories? - No.

01:05:53.303 --> 01:05:55.803
What have you been seeing?

01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:02.244
Is this my Dad's car?

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:07.242
How would I know that? - I don't
know, you guys were friends, right?

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:15.578
You know your mother never liked to
talk about it. She was very young,

01:06:17.671 --> 01:06:21.751
and I think that he, hurt her, very much.

01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:25.391
Maybe Max knows.

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:32.152
Max was the Chief Resident
at Mass General and,

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:35.786
your mother was an intern,
and I was the patient. - Right.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:39.716
This was after she had
ended it with your father.

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:45.321
And I really have no idea whose car that is.
- Okay. Thanks.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.540
You have to forget about the past.

01:06:50.002 --> 01:06:53.300
Just move forward, and would you please,

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.176
please, get some rest.

01:07:00.158 --> 01:07:02.812
This was his username on Bonnie's computer.

01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:06.372
You ever hear of that?
- No.

01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:16.522
Nothing.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.500
Hey, look at this.

01:07:27.895 --> 01:07:30.395
Kafziel appears in a
shining blast of light.

01:07:30.586 --> 01:07:33.746
You've got to be kidding me. - He was
the angel of death over little children.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.426
He was cast out of heaven.

01:07:37.892 --> 01:07:41.481
He took no interest in boys, but dedicated
himself to preserving the innocence

01:07:42.301 --> 01:07:44.801
of little girls.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.653
This is really scary to me.

01:07:57.597 --> 01:08:00.097
That's why you can't be around here anymore.
- What?

01:08:01.766 --> 01:08:04.486
I may not have these memories in
my head, but I'm part of this now.

01:08:04.487 --> 01:08:09.653
I know, and that's the problem. I
don't know where this is going. I'm...

01:08:11.365 --> 01:08:14.859
That's it? - Yeah... - You're being
ridiculous! Why are you acting like this?

01:08:14.894 --> 01:08:16.974
Because I don't think you
should be here right now.

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:18.854
I don't think you should
be with me right now,

01:08:18.856 --> 01:08:21.104
and I think you should go, right now.

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:27.435
Get out, please.

01:08:28.663 --> 01:08:31.163
Get out!
- Fine!

01:08:35.337 --> 01:08:37.837
Shit.

01:09:52.575 --> 01:09:55.477
Ready to move?
- Max, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot.

01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:59.964
What the hell have you been doing, Rip
Van Winkle, I left 3 messages for you.

01:10:00.077 --> 01:10:04.382
I haven't been feeling too good, man.
- No shit.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:09.259
Viral?
- I don't know. Probably, maybe.

01:10:11.485 --> 01:10:14.883
Well, we don't need
to move this shit today.

01:10:17.265 --> 01:10:19.765
The smoke bother you?
- No, it's fine.

01:10:20.642 --> 01:10:24.245
I think I'll just stick
around and nurse myself a beer.

01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:35.976
You're looking at my shoes. - Yeah,
they're really cool, where did you get those?

01:10:36.112 --> 01:10:39.460
I've had these forever. I mean,
I use them to just, you know, I...

01:10:41.093 --> 01:10:44.449
...you know, fart around the
house in them. They're back in style,

01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:47.013
I'll get you a pair, pal.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

01:10:48.749 --> 01:10:51.249
Are you okay?

01:10:52.567 --> 01:10:55.067
Deep says that you need to get laid.

01:10:55.939 --> 01:11:00.495
Now that Steph... She's great
looking to me, I think?

01:11:03.782 --> 01:11:08.161
If I don't lie down, I don't
know what I'm going to do, Max.

01:11:10.204 --> 01:11:13.530
Okay, I can go rent myself
some DVDs or something.

01:11:15.643 --> 01:11:18.910
I'm sorry, Max.
- No, no, no, you get some rest, buddy.

01:11:19.587 --> 01:11:22.386
I will. - Okay, pal.
- Have a good night. Bye bye.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.390
Bonnie.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.000
Bonnie!

01:11:57.706 --> 01:12:00.206
Bonnie.

01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:06.534
Bonnie!

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.910
Bonnie!

01:12:10.105 --> 01:12:12.605
Hello?

01:12:41.814 --> 01:12:44.314
Get away!

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:30.636
Go away.

01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:33.731
No.

01:13:48.104 --> 01:13:50.604
Max? Max! Max!

01:13:55.757 --> 01:13:58.257
Man, come on!

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.440
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:33.966
What have I done?

01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:36.467
Oh my God! Fuck!

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.642
Carol!

01:15:01.643 --> 01:15:04.143
Carol!

01:17:32.984 --> 01:17:36.354
Allison Frost... what
are you doing here?

01:17:48.415 --> 01:17:50.915
These are copies of all my stuff.

01:17:57.877 --> 01:18:00.744
# GENETICALLY INHERITED MEMORY? #

01:18:09.148 --> 01:18:14.560
Leizfak is now online.
- They've been finding them on the internet.

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:33.004
Psych evaluation report.

01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:38.625
Carol Barbara Hargrave

01:19:41.504 --> 01:19:44.518
Doctor for 3 years before
killing her abductor.

01:19:45.696 --> 01:19:49.151
Patient raped and impregnated
by deceased abductor.

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:33.616
Adopted by Dr. Alisha Briggs.

01:20:36.473 --> 01:20:38.973
Witnessed by Max?

01:20:41.266 --> 01:20:43.766
Biological mother.

01:20:47.707 --> 01:20:50.207
Carol Hargrave.

01:22:25.496 --> 01:22:27.996
God. Dear God.

01:23:15.561 --> 01:23:18.061
Steph?

01:23:26.347 --> 01:23:28.847
What? What is it?

01:23:55.762 --> 01:23:59.489
Why didn't you tell me? - You don't
need to know about your real father.

01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:03.289
He was a story no one wants know.

01:24:04.292 --> 01:24:08.221
Why did you have to kill Max?
- I made it look like you did it.

01:24:09.162 --> 01:24:13.661
Max wasn't your father. He was
the last link to the adoption.

01:24:14.748 --> 01:24:19.092
I had to kill him so that I
wouldn't have to kill my own son.

01:24:21.252 --> 01:24:26.849
You're going to have to kill me now.
- You will never take this away from me.

01:24:27.711 --> 01:24:32.620
Where's Bonnie?
- Be calm, Taylor, I know what you've seen.

01:24:33.521 --> 01:24:36.862
But every memory has to have an end.

01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:43.076
It'll go in a blinding light.
And it'll just get colder,

01:24:44.086 --> 01:24:46.480
and colder,

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:50.733
but unlike you, they will live on forever.

01:24:51.571 --> 01:24:54.821
Goodbye Taylor.
Goodbye Taylor.

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:58.169
Goodbye Taylor.

01:25:42.823 --> 01:25:45.323
Where's Bonnie?

01:25:46.663 --> 01:25:49.163
Bonnie?

01:25:55.331 --> 01:25:57.831
Bonnie?

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.329
Come on, girl.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:13.249
Come on.

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:19.498
Come on, go get it.
There you go. You get that?

01:27:20.094 --> 01:27:22.594
Come on.
- Bonni?

01:27:29.927 --> 01:27:33.887
Bonnie? Oh, my God! My God!

01:27:34.898 --> 01:27:39.064
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:42.910
My God!

01:28:02.423 --> 01:28:04.923
You're going pro with those
new glasses, buddy. - Nice.

01:28:05.867 --> 01:28:09.356
Good news.
- Clean bill of health. You fucker.

01:28:09.757 --> 01:28:12.885
What did you say, Dad?
- I said, you're lucky, buster,

01:28:13.089 --> 01:28:15.589
because we're going to
get a pizza after the game.

01:28:16.383 --> 01:28:18.883
It's good to be alive, Deep.
- Yeah, it is.

01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:33.851
She'll always be my mother to me.

01:28:38.093 --> 01:28:40.593
This was her favorite room in the house.

01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:46.761
If she were alive, she'd
want you to work here.

01:28:57.683 --> 01:29:00.362
Oh, boy, got to get Nick to
the game, before he kills me.

01:29:00.562 --> 01:29:03.062
No, no, no, no.

01:29:09.129 --> 01:29:11.584
Thank you.
- For what?

01:29:11.585 --> 01:29:15.169
Everything.
- Yeah, alright.

01:29:18.243 --> 01:29:20.843
Is there anything else a big,
strong man can do before we leave?

01:29:20.844 --> 01:29:23.428
Yes, certainly. You can
log that upstairs for me.

01:29:23.589 --> 01:29:26.089
Oh, really? Alright.
- Yeah.

01:29:29.521 --> 01:29:32.625
Anything interesting? - Well, if you
find a kid's keepsakes interesting,

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.801
check it out by all means.
- Alright.

01:29:42.101 --> 01:29:44.601
You okay?

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:54.458
So did you break anything?

01:29:57.389 --> 01:29:59.889
Taylor?

01:30:02.053 --> 01:30:04.553
Are you okay?
- Where did you get this?

01:30:06.705 --> 01:30:10.065
I don't know. I had it on me in the hospital,
when they pulled me out of the water.

01:30:15.834 --> 01:30:18.334
Is Stephanie Jacobs your real name?

01:30:21.803 --> 01:30:24.303
The Jacobs named me that
when they adopted me.

01:30:25.389 --> 01:30:27.889
I don't remember my real name, why?

01:30:38.438 --> 01:30:40.938
Taylor, why?
