lucas! come on. it's me. open up.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.350
look. i am sorry i am late,

00:12.385 --> 00:13.700
but i couldn't get away.

00:13.735 --> 00:15.000
are you there?

00:16.600 --> 00:17.900
hey. hey.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.850
are you looking for lucas?

00:20.885 --> 00:22.542
uh,no. i'll just come back.

00:22.577 --> 00:24.165
well,he should be here.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.465
his car's parked in his space and mine.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
could you tell him that
those parallel white lines

00:28.535 --> 00:29.765
actually serve a purpose?

00:29.800 --> 00:31.500
i had to park on the street again.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:51.500 --> 00:52.100
lucas

00:53.300 --> 00:54.900
somebody help!

00:58.800 --> 01:00.300
i don't know. i just
saw him lying by his car.

01:00.335 --> 01:01.900
so tell me again what happened,ma'am.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.300
hello?

01:21.700 --> 01:23.400
yes. this is melinda gordon.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.200
sure i remember you.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.700
lucas? i'm so sorry.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.200
um,yeah,ok.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.400
thanks.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.950
ok. weird.

01:42.985 --> 01:44.300
what was that?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.600
well,this guy from my high school,

01:46.635 --> 01:48.800
lucas marston, he died.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.500
i never heard you talk about him.

01:51.535 --> 01:53.400
was he a good friend? no.

01:53.435 --> 01:54.400
not at all.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.100
so why did i just get
invited to his funeral?

02:03.800 --> 02:06.300
grace: there's haylie.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.699
haylie,hi.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.200
guest of honor here yet?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.300
i don't see him,but
i've seen a couple people

02:15.335 --> 02:17.700
checking me out just in case i did.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.400
honey,i think they were
just checking you out.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.800
i've literally heard,like,5
guys say how beautiful you were.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.700
yeah. meaning how much i've changed,

02:24.735 --> 02:26.400
but one thing has not.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.865
hey. i think they probably included you

02:27.900 --> 02:30.400
because they remembered you
and maybe they liked you.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.700
i was the kid who was caught talking

02:31.800 --> 02:32.900
to dead people,ok?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.600
they called me a freak,a mental case,

02:34.700 --> 02:37.100
and my personal favorite
- meloony gordon.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.300
catchy,i know, but not at the time.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.550
all right. so it was a drag,

02:40.585 --> 02:41.700
but then why are we here?

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
well,because lucas always
seemed like a nice guy

02:42.900 --> 02:44.500
and grace,too, but then again,

02:44.600 --> 02:46.000
maybe they were so into each other,

02:46.100 --> 02:47.800
they were too busy to be mean.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.865
which one's grace?

02:48.900 --> 02:50.000
uh,pretty blond. the one that got

02:50.100 --> 02:51.500
icy reception from haylie.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.165
they used to be friends.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.300
haylie,you know, she was lucas'

02:55.400 --> 02:57.300
on-and-off-again
girlfriend.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.600
i thought you said you
didn't know these people.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.100
oh,i knew of them. everyone did.

03:01.135 --> 03:03.500
you know,they were a power clique,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.900
superbeautiful and all best friends.

03:06.935 --> 03:08.965
go. let's go.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.600
grace: i'll be right back.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.100
oh. looks like grace is with ryan now.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.365
him i know.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.600
really? how do you know him?

03:16.700 --> 03:20.100
he's a surgical resident
at grandview hospital.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.965
that is so disappointing

03:22.000 --> 03:24.500
when the person who's voted most
likely to succeed actually does.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.700
um... guess i was right

03:25.800 --> 03:27.500
about why i was asked here.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.600
melinda.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.800
grace,hi.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.000
uh,you met my husband jim,right?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.800
yes,hi. and actually, i
have a favor to ask hi.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.165
that i hope you won't mind,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.700
but,um,if you're going
back to grandview,

03:39.800 --> 03:42.400
would you mind riding with me?

03:47.700 --> 03:49.100
grace: the reason i called you was,

03:49.200 --> 03:50.265
you remember in high school

03:50.300 --> 03:53.600
how you said you could see ghosts?

03:53.635 --> 03:56.100
i never said that.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.865
not if i could help
it, and i still don't.

04:00.900 --> 04:07.200
but do you believe that you
can,um,see them,the dead?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.100
have you seen lucas?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.400
no.

04:15.500 --> 04:21.600
so what is it like when
someone is haunting you?

04:21.635 --> 04:22.967
i mean,are they around all the time,

04:23.002 --> 04:24.300
or do they just kind of come and go?

04:24.400 --> 04:27.000
i mean,what can they do to someone?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.800
you mean,to you.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.800
look. i-i found him,

04:35.900 --> 04:38.500
and there was blood, not just on lucas

04:38.600 --> 04:39.800
from where he'd collapsed

04:39.900 --> 04:42.800
but streaked across his car window.

04:42.835 --> 04:44.700
i know it sounds crazy.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
i'm so nervous.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
grace?

04:50.100 --> 04:52.700
ahh. oh-oh,god. oh,god.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.250
that is disgusting.

04:54.285 --> 04:55.700
are you all right?

04:55.800 --> 04:56.900
melinda, the medical examiner

04:57.000 --> 04:58.100
said that when they found lucas

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
he had been dead for hours,

04:59.300 --> 05:01.600
but i saw that blood appear,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.865
and ever since i saw it,

05:03.900 --> 05:06.200
i've felt something around me.

05:06.235 --> 05:07.465
i can't describe it.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
i'm not sure you have to.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.400
because-because you know the feeling?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.000
yeah. pretty well.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.800
child,whispering: can you see us?

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
<font color=#4096d1>-

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
<font color="#4096d1">- =http:/www.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.560
eli: wait. so the ghost
smeared its own blood

05:57.570 --> 05:58.580
for grace to see?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.860
melinda: well,yeah,eli.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.800
i mean,you've seen them
move objects around.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.800
it's pretty much the same principle.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.000
the on the way home hurled
itself against the windshield?

06:06.100 --> 06:07.700
ghosts can sometimes act out.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.000
hey. if i'm gonna hear ghosts,

06:09.100 --> 06:10.800
i might as well get the whole picture.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.000
you know what? that surprises me

06:12.100 --> 06:14.100
because most people in
your position,they just-

06:14.200 --> 06:16.000
you mean,who died and come
back with bonus features?

06:16.035 --> 06:17.700
you know that many of us?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.165
melinda,i've written books
upon books on subjects

06:20.200 --> 06:23.600
about a thousandth as cool as what's
going on in my skull right now.

06:23.635 --> 06:24.700
i mean, don't get me wrong.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.265
this whole ghost thing,

06:26.300 --> 06:28.165
it's kind of creepy at times,

06:28.200 --> 06:31.600
but this,this psycho paranormal whatever

06:31.700 --> 06:33.100
is a trip.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.300
glad to hear it.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.465
how can i help?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.800
well,anytime that a ghost comes to you-

06:37.835 --> 06:38.917
no. i mean,you.

06:38.952 --> 06:40.000
loop me in.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.200
how else am i gonna learn?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.400
can i use your computer?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.350
eli: who knew hamilton high was

06:44.385 --> 06:46.165
a feeder school for the ivies?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.500
after yale, mr. lucas marston worked

06:48.535 --> 06:50.117
in the skiing industry.

06:50.152 --> 06:51.700
he was a lift attendant.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.200
he dabbled in real estate development.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.800
his dad owns an apartment building.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.000
i overheard someone at the wake saying

06:56.035 --> 06:57.565
that he was the handyman.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.000
so if you know so much about the ghost,

06:59.100 --> 07:00.800
why are we bothering
with the obituary spin?

07:00.900 --> 07:03.600
well,because lucas' background
is just a starting place.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.900
i mean,the truth is,i didn't
get a good look at the ghost.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.300
that alone can tell you something.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.300
chockfull of antioxidants.

07:11.335 --> 07:13.600
no,thanks.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.100
so you think the ghost

07:16.200 --> 07:18.500
miss popular mowed down the
night of her friend's wake

07:18.535 --> 07:19.700
was somebody random?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.965
no. there's always a connection,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.200
but if the ghost that i saw on the road

07:22.300 --> 07:25.200
was lucas,why wasn't
he at his own funeral?

07:25.235 --> 07:26.900
soaking up the kind words.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.300
yeah. something like that.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.600
maybe the words people
said under their breaths

07:29.700 --> 07:30.965
weren't so kind.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.800
call me crazy,but when a
perfectly healthy,bright,

07:33.900 --> 07:36.900
but underachieving 29-year-old
suddenly keels over,

07:36.935 --> 07:37.900
i smell...

07:38.000 --> 07:39.165
drugs.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.700
i haven't seen the
result of the tox report,

07:40.800 --> 07:44.400
but they're saying it was an overdose.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
grace,don't do this.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.900
we don't have anything
to feel guilty about.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.565
we know what we did.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.800
i have to scrub up, but we'll talk.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.600
no,we won't, not about this.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.700
more light,please.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.200
would somebody get that
out of my eyes,please?

08:39.299 --> 08:41.400
are you ok, dr. hellar?

08:41.434 --> 08:43.465
yeah.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.300
then why don't you close up?

08:45.335 --> 08:46.500
right.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.700
all right. stitch and dress.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.465
ok.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.900
we're good here.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.600
nice work,everybody.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.000
whoa,whoa. what the hell?

09:06.100 --> 09:08.200
the wound's closed. where's
this blood coming from?

09:08.300 --> 09:10.400
whoa! oh,my god!

09:11.500 --> 09:14.000
no. what's going on?

09:14.100 --> 09:16.900
i'll get dr. dugan.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.400
aah!

09:20.500 --> 09:22.200
i'll take over.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.465
jim,voice-over: ryan
comes tearing out of there.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.800
the nurse i spoke to said
there was blood everywhere.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.400
what happened? i don't know,

09:34.500 --> 09:36.000
but when the surgeon comes back,

09:36.100 --> 09:38.500
no more blood, patient is fine.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.165
the blood has to mean something.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.500
thanks. and why don't you
not go to work right now?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.000
as much as i love
playing hooky with you,

09:45.035 --> 09:46.100
i have to go.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
oh. you forgot one of your tear sheets.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.200
wait a minute. we're
putting a 6-burner stove

09:50.300 --> 09:51.100
in the nursery?

09:51.200 --> 09:52.365
it's for the garage.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.700
i was thinking that we could convert it

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
into a guest house, you know,

09:54.900 --> 09:57.000
for a live-in sitter
or for our mothers.

09:57.035 --> 09:58.165
i mean,it's a good idea,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.665
but,uh,i mean,
converting the garage now.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.000
aren't we getting a
little ahead of ourselves?

10:03.035 --> 10:05.317
because i'm not getting pregnant?

10:05.352 --> 10:07.600
hey. no,no. because when you do,

10:07.700 --> 10:08.900
we'll still have 9 months.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.300
i mean,let me run the
numbers a little bit,

10:11.335 --> 10:12.700
think about it,ok?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.700
ok. sure.

10:20.700 --> 10:25.200
ryan: lucas' death,well,
it freaked us both out,

10:25.300 --> 10:27.000
i have to be honest,

10:27.100 --> 10:28.100
but what happened at the hospital-

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
i think it was a ghost.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.900
did you feel anything strange,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.100
a chill you couldn't explain,

10:37.135 --> 10:38.400
after lucas died?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.300
ghosts. we're talking ghosts now with-

10:41.335 --> 10:43.617
ryan,i asked melinda for her help.

10:43.652 --> 10:45.900
look. a suture must have ruptured.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.100
i made a mistake,ok? it happens.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.850
i've been stressed.

10:50.885 --> 10:53.500
i work crazy hours,

10:53.600 --> 10:56.300
and my best friend from
high school just died.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.900
so you and lucas were still close?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.100
we were fine.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.300
i am happy to finish my coffee

11:05.400 --> 11:07.065
and go back to my life

11:07.100 --> 11:09.400
because i am not afraid of the d dead,

11:09.500 --> 11:13.700
but you came to me,and an
innocent person lost a lot of blood

11:13.800 --> 11:15.600
because you have something
you need to resolve

11:15.635 --> 11:17.400
with either lucas or someone else.

11:17.435 --> 11:18.600
who else would it be then?

11:18.700 --> 11:21.400
i haven't seen the ghost,
so i don't know who it is,

11:21.435 --> 11:23.100
but when a ghost doesn't
reveal themselves,

11:23.200 --> 11:24.265
it's for a reason.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.800
either they're hiding something,

11:25.835 --> 11:27.300
or they have a project in mind,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.200
like torturing you.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.500
why don't you try to not say that

11:32.600 --> 11:33.400
like you enjoy it?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.000
i don't,

11:35.100 --> 11:38.000
and i don't like seeing souls linger,

11:38.100 --> 11:39.800
but that's what they do when they're

11:39.900 --> 11:41.100
trying to finish something.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.000
well,you're casting an
awfully wide net there.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.700
i don't know what lucas
did for the last 10 years

11:45.800 --> 11:48.300
when he was supposed to be
building a career,a life.

11:48.335 --> 11:50.065
you want to know? ask haylie.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.300
she waited around long enough
for him to get his act together.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.600
all i know is that he o.d.ed at 29,

11:54.700 --> 11:57.000
so if you want to know
what he didn't finish,

11:57.100 --> 11:59.000
why don't you try everything?

12:02.100 --> 12:04.100
and he's got no one
to blame but himself.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.700
oh,my god!

12:08.800 --> 12:10.100
you're bleeding.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.700
ryan.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.000
i need another napkin.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.700
what was that?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.500
you found him. you were
there when the police came.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.200
are they sure his body wasn't moved?

12:32.235 --> 12:33.417
what are you talking about?

12:33.452 --> 12:34.600
grace,let's go. come on.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.200
i've had enough.

12:36.235 --> 12:38.200
ok.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.100
we don't need your
particular brand of help,ok?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.500
i wouldn't be so sure about that.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.500
ah. hamilton high, 1998-

12:59.600 --> 13:01.200
big hair and big dreams.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.265
oh,wait. that's not you!

13:03.300 --> 13:06.500
no,it's not,but will show you lucas.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.765
the guy who died? he's so cute.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.100
yeah. died or was
murdered by his friend.

13:12.135 --> 13:13.200
i saw it in a vision,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.300
but i only got a piece of the story.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.400
ich is not exactly the
story ryan's telling?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.365
no. he seems pretty keen

13:18.400 --> 13:19.900
on blaming lucas for his own death.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.300
he said he was a real screw-up

13:21.335 --> 13:23.817
and that if i doubted him

13:23.852 --> 13:26.076
i could talk to haylie.

13:26.111 --> 13:27.705
well,color me doubtful.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.300
hmm. my favorite color.

13:29.335 --> 13:31.700
ha ha ha!

13:31.800 --> 13:33.300
are you calling haylie?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.300
are you kidding? the girl
was so perfect in high school,

13:35.400 --> 13:36.600
there's not crack in her demeanor.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.400
she would never open up to me.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
come on. you are not still afraid

13:40.600 --> 13:42.000
of the popular girl?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.400
hardly.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.900
besides,eli is a very
experienced grief counselor,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.200
and he wants to learn,so
let him melt the ice queen.

13:52.235 --> 13:55.400
i spent a third of my
life as lucas' girlfriend,

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
give or take our many breakups,

13:57.600 --> 14:01.200
and even in death, who
does he go to? grace.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.400
look,haylie. it isn't just grace.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.100
lucas is haunting ryan,too.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.600
were they rivals?

14:06.700 --> 14:08.100
lucas and grace, i mean,they were

14:08.200 --> 14:10.050
closer to each other than to anybody

14:10.085 --> 14:11.900
they were actually sleeping with.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.465
come on. ryan know this?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.465
well,i'm sure. they never hid it.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.400
they'd be on the phone
for two hours at a stretch.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.865
there was something unhealthy about it.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.000
that wasn't exactly helping
his battle with drugs.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.365
he took antianxiety medication,

14:25.400 --> 14:27.400
but i never saw him take anything else.

14:27.435 --> 14:29.400
i've treated a lot of addicts.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.300
they're very secretive.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.200
he wasn't always.

14:35.300 --> 14:39.500
it wasn't always so
hard for him to be happy.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.200
you make it seem like
something happened.

14:42.235 --> 14:43.517
what was it?

14:43.552 --> 14:44.800
i wish i knew.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.300
i think that ryan and grace do

14:49.400 --> 14:51.900
because senior year, the 3 of them,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.900
they went to look at some colleges.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.400
they were gone for 4 days,

14:55.500 --> 14:59.700
and when they came back,
lucas was never the same.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.800
melinda: haylie gave you
her keys to lucas' apartment?

15:05.900 --> 15:07.165
you're a quick study.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.700
what can i say? people trust me.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.300
i'm a professional.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.200
it sounds like to me that lucas

15:14.300 --> 15:17.400
was still in love with
grace and ryan knew it.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.900
i'm not sure this was about grace.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.200
it seems like lucas was
more haunted than haunting.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.865
so the question is,who
or what was haunting him,

15:24.900 --> 15:28.265
and is it the same spirit
that's haunting ryan and grace?

15:28.300 --> 15:32.000
shouldn't we be,like,wearing
latex gloves,carrying flashlights?

15:32.035 --> 15:33.265
knock yourself out.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.500
no need. these will do the trick.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.000
benzodiazepine-

15:38.100 --> 15:40.350
a little dose will
help you get some sleep.

15:40.385 --> 15:42.600
a larger dose will
help you with anxiety.

15:42.635 --> 15:44.900
supersizing can kill you.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.450
whoa. oh.

15:49.485 --> 15:50.600
what is it?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.900
looks like family,
maybe a sister or niece.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.100
lucas was an only child.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.700
grace: oh,my god,lucas. oh,
my god,oh,my god,oh,my god!

16:09.800 --> 16:10.865
grace,grace, shut up!

16:10.900 --> 16:12.500
oh,my god! what are we gonna do?

16:14.300 --> 16:16.600
what? what is it?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.400
the 3 of them...

16:19.900 --> 16:21.700
they killed a man.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.500
that's it then.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.700
the ghost was telling you
he was murdered,not lucas.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.200
he didn't tell me anything.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.600
i got a vision from his picture,

16:28.700 --> 16:30.200
but i still don't know who he is,

16:30.300 --> 16:31.400
and if he wants me to know the truth,

16:31.500 --> 16:33.000
then why isn't he coming to me?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.700
maybe he wants you to come to him.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.400
for someone who's gift is in their ears,

16:36.500 --> 16:39.300
you're not a very good listener.

16:39.335 --> 16:40.700
eli?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.800
this wasn't just for pictures.

16:44.835 --> 16:46.600
the victim kept i.d. in here,too,

16:46.700 --> 16:47.800
which i'm sure lucas trashed

16:47.900 --> 16:49.900
in case anyone found it.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.100
there was something in this
sleeve for a very long time.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.300
haylie said something about a
road trip fall of your senior year.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.000
she mentioned something happened

16:58.100 --> 16:59.565
and oktoberfest in cambridge.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.200
well,that gives us a definite weekend.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.000
that,a partial name and address,

17:03.100 --> 17:07.099
and it sure looked like he
had a child with someone.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.700
his widow. that's my next step.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.865
what if i took that step for you?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.700
i think i'm up to it if
you think it could help.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.800
yes. that would help a lot.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.900
ok. ok.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.700
hey. no,no,no. no. it's not even 3:00.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.100
no. oh,look. i got
to go cover for sully.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.900
i really got to go,and i'm
gonna be late,so don't wait up.

17:35.100 --> 17:38.300
hey. what's wrong?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.900
well,i just kind of thought we could-

17:41.000 --> 17:42.800
i mean,if we're gonna
get pregnant,you know,

17:42.835 --> 17:43.800
we have to...

17:43.900 --> 17:44.865
have sex!

17:44.900 --> 17:46.100
we got that covered,right?

17:46.200 --> 17:49.400
today. it's just i've
been tracking my cycle,

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
and there's this window,

17:50.600 --> 17:53.365
and it's basically closing tonight.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.300
right,and that's
- that's why you've been playing hooky from work.

17:56.335 --> 17:57.465
well,it's not the only reason,

17:57.500 --> 18:00.200
but we did agree that we would try,so...

18:00.235 --> 18:01.800
you're right. we did,we did,

18:01.900 --> 18:05.200
but,i mean,honey,do we have to
schedule our sex life,you know,

18:05.235 --> 18:06.600
or convert a garage to have kids?

18:06.700 --> 18:09.500
it's just so much pressure.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.300
you're right. you're right.

18:14.900 --> 18:19.100
hey. i want you, i always want you,

18:19.200 --> 18:22.200
but it's just we got so
many stresses in our life.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.700
let's not make this
another one,all right?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.700
yeah. can i help you? mom?

18:35.800 --> 18:39.300
hi. my name is eli james. i'm sorry
i didn't call before i came over.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.600
yeah?

18:44.800 --> 18:48.300
i'm sorry. i just-
i'm here because-

18:48.400 --> 18:49.900
male ghost: that's
right. you've seen her.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.500
that girl grew up without a father.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.500
ahh,ahh.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.700
because?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.300
tell her you have something of theirs.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.700
i'm sorry. tell her.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.600
tell her now.

19:00.700 --> 19:01.900
i'm just
- ok.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.600
no,no. i have something of yours.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.100
i mean,i have something
of your husband's.

19:07.135 --> 19:10.500
uh,honey,can you go check on the dinner?

19:10.600 --> 19:11.500
yeah,yeah.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.950
i'll be out back.

19:13.985 --> 19:16.300
i don't understand.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.300
you said these photos of my husband were

19:17.400 --> 19:18.900
in your friend's apartment?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
how-how could that be?

19:20.100 --> 19:21.900
i was hoping you could tell me.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.500
well,i don't know any lucas,

19:23.600 --> 19:25.400
and tim's wallet was with his body.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.567
this was all that was missing.

19:27.602 --> 19:29.700
didn't you find that strange?

19:29.800 --> 19:32.600
mister,i had a toddler and dead husband.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.900
worrying about a few photos wasn't

19:34.000 --> 19:35.600
at the top of my list.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.700
i'm sorry.

19:37.735 --> 19:39.665
i am,too.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.900
sorry he died out on that
road alone,pitch black,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.300
rain pouring down.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.400
the coroner said that
he'd severed an artery

19:48.500 --> 19:50.200
so it was probably fast,

19:50.300 --> 19:53.400
but define fast,you know,if you're tim.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.800
what did they tell
you about the accident?

19:58.900 --> 20:02.000
just that. it was an accident.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.500
there were no other skid marks

20:03.535 --> 20:05.000
from another vehicle,

20:05.100 --> 20:07.250
the road was slick.

20:07.285 --> 20:09.400
he just wiped out.

20:09.450 --> 20:10.510
who found him.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.010
a little lady drived her
little husbhud to work.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.480
what wouldn'ldgive e them.

20:16.890 --> 20:18.695
girl: are you ok,mom?

20:18.730 --> 20:20.500
hi,honey. it's ok.

20:20.535 --> 20:23.500
ok.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.165
so how did your friend

20:26.200 --> 20:28.300
get these from my husband unless-

20:28.335 --> 20:30.400
unless hew as there when he died.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.900
you said you didn't know lucas.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.700
do you know these people?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.900
they'd be older now.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.300
no.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.600
hold on. him. him i know.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.400
him? that's lucas.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.200
no. he said his name was mark.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.265
you met him? when?

20:47.300 --> 20:48.900
he came by the house a few months

20:49.000 --> 20:50.700
after my husband's death,

20:50.735 --> 20:52.567
said he worked with tim once

20:52.602 --> 20:54.400
and that he owed him some money.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.665
seemed like he didn't have much,

20:55.700 --> 20:57.500
but he sent what he
could over the years.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.800
wait. over the years?

20:59.900 --> 21:01.700
every once in a while,
i'd get a cashier's check

21:01.800 --> 21:04.500
for 50 bucks, a few hundred.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.800
well,i cashed them.

21:11.900 --> 21:15.400
i thought he was a buddy,
you know,took pity on us,

21:15.500 --> 21:17.300
and frankly,we needed the money,so...

21:17.400 --> 21:21.700
i never realized that
it was,um,sort of...

21:21.800 --> 21:23.300
male ghost: blood money.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.400
eli: you should have heard it.

21:28.435 --> 21:29.767
this guy sounded so bitter,

21:29.802 --> 21:31.065
like a big hunk of bitterness

21:31.100 --> 21:32.965
in the front row seating
in my frontal lobe.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.500
yeah,but it sounds like
lucas was haunted for years,

21:35.535 --> 21:37.100
but why not grace and ryan?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.400
i mean,they were there,too.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.900
who says they weren't
haunted this whole time?

21:40.935 --> 21:42.600
maybe they just dealt with it better.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.000
no. it was new for grace.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.200
she was scared. she kept
asking what a ghost could do.

21:47.235 --> 21:50.100
because she thinks it killed her friend,

21:50.200 --> 21:52.800
and she just realized...

21:52.835 --> 21:54.500
they're next.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.500
grace: can't you just drive
me back to the city tonight?

21:58.600 --> 22:00.300
lucas' sendoff is tomorrow

22:00.400 --> 22:01.500
the people that
couldn't make the funeral

22:01.600 --> 22:02.500
are flying in.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.500
"his sendoff." i hate that phrase.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.417
you said "memorial" sounded geriatric.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.300
is there anything i can say right now

22:09.400 --> 22:10.500
that won't piss you off?

22:10.600 --> 22:12.165
you could tell the truth.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.600
yeah. we all could have,but we didn't.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.600
we made a choice to
get on with our lives.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.600
don't you feel it?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.600
he is with us!

22:22.400 --> 22:24.100
he was with lucas all the time.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.300
grace,the man died 10 years ago,ok?

22:26.400 --> 22:29.300
it's ridiculous. crazy
people believe in ghosts.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.800
ryan.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.600
no!

22:55.000 --> 22:56.830
they brought them in about an hour ago,

22:56.850 --> 22:58.270
and ryan was pretty banged up,

22:58.290 --> 22:59.820
and they're giving him a full body scan,

22:59.910 --> 23:01.160
but he was lucky.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.770
grace had some contusions,
but his side took

23:03.810 --> 23:05.190
the brunt of the roll.

23:05.225 --> 23:06.290
how did she seem?

23:06.300 --> 23:07.355
i didn't talk to her,

23:07.390 --> 23:09.570
but they said she was really shaken up.

23:09.830 --> 23:10.870
grace.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.440
please. make him stop.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.400
so i was just kicking and screaming,

23:21.470 --> 23:24.180
and this policeman took his hand,

23:24.190 --> 23:26.200
and he just dragged
it along the windshield

23:26.210 --> 23:29.540
just to show me that it
was just mud. it was mud.

23:29.630 --> 23:31.080
do you know what i thought it was?

23:31.340 --> 23:32.140
blood?

23:33.380 --> 23:34.260
yes.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.390
i've seen it,too.

23:38.930 --> 23:41.410
i know about the guy
who died 10 years ago.

23:42.990 --> 23:46.210
so it was him all along?

23:47.290 --> 23:48.800
how did he die?

23:54.940 --> 23:56.100
we took a road trip. i don't know.

23:56.220 --> 23:58.160
i mean,we were just going
to see some colleges...

23:58.260 --> 23:58.940
so we're at this party,right?

23:58.960 --> 24:00.800
and ryan knew this guy up in binghamton,

24:00.900 --> 24:03.585
and he invited us to a frat party,

24:03.620 --> 24:06.235
and we should have just stayed there,

24:06.270 --> 24:07.900
but we promised our parents
that we would head home.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.080
and lucas was supposed to
be the designated driver,

24:11.130 --> 24:13.410
but he ended up just
being the least drunk,

24:13.420 --> 24:14.540
and that was not like him.

24:14.550 --> 24:15.500
he was always so responsible.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.300
he was a really good guy.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.400
and he was driving
superslow when this guy

24:19.500 --> 24:21.800
on a motorcycle just came up behind us.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.100
this guy's practically on our fender

24:24.200 --> 24:25.365
what's he doing?

24:25.400 --> 24:28.500
grace: he wants you to speed up.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.760
but the road, it just-it curved,

24:31.770 --> 24:34.400
and it was so foggy,
and i guess that the guy

24:34.440 --> 24:36.490
just got stuck and it pissed him off,

24:36.540 --> 24:38.550
and that's when he decided
to try to take us on.

24:38.590 --> 24:40.870
you ok,lucas? yeah,sure.

24:40.920 --> 24:41.970
slow down,slow down. slow way down.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.070
just teach him a lesson.

24:43.105 --> 24:44.600
[horn honking[

24:44.700 --> 24:46.950
well,come on! what,you
want to join our party?

24:46.990 --> 24:49.500
ryan! ryan!

24:50.600 --> 24:52.400
whoa,whoa,whoa! did you see that?

24:58.700 --> 25:00.300
oh,my god!

25:04.600 --> 25:06.200
you got to stay in the car.

25:06.235 --> 25:07.600
please.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.700
he must have been thrown.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.800
here we go.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.900
come on!

25:54.300 --> 25:55.600
come on!

25:55.700 --> 25:57.300
ryan.

25:57.335 --> 25:58.865
come on.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.300
oh,my god! oh,my god!

26:00.400 --> 26:02.365
his leg is half off.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.200
oh,my god! grace,grace,shut up.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.700
what are we going to do?

26:06.735 --> 26:09.100
there's nothing we can do.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.400
a phone. a phone. we'll call 911.

26:12.435 --> 26:15.400
he's dead, and you're drunk,

26:15.500 --> 26:16.800
and we're all drunk.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.300
i'm not drunk.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
tell that to a breathalyzer.

26:20.435 --> 26:22.400
ryan,what are you saying?

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
i'm saying this never happened.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.700
we didn't hit him. there's no evidence.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.300
it's his own fault!

26:30.400 --> 26:32.700
ok,ok. so we'll tell the cops that.

26:32.735 --> 26:35.000
listen. you want your life ending

26:35.100 --> 26:37.100
on this road tonight,too?

26:51.900 --> 26:56.000
what we did, it haunted lucas.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.800
and you.

26:58.900 --> 27:03.100
you said you felt it, an angry presence.

27:03.135 --> 27:06.100
yes. ever since lucas died.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.165
but not before? no.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.700
not that i don't think
about it all the time.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.900
the blood.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
there was so much blood.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.300
i cannot stand the sight of it.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.700
your fear of blood,

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
did you ever talk to lucas about it?

27:28.900 --> 27:33.100
yeah. he was the only
one i could talk to.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.165
lucas?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.700
you can skip the blood
and tell me what you want.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.500
i know it's you.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.400
i never said i was anyone else.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.100
no. i guess you didn't have to.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.500
you just let their guilt do the work.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.800
ryan's guilt has a ways to go.

27:57.835 --> 28:00.000
he'd do anything to cover this up.

28:00.035 --> 28:01.365
let me help you.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.500
we could talk to them together.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.400
they wouldn't listen
to me when i was alive.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.700
why would they listen to me now?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.600
you could have told
the truth at any time.

28:09.635 --> 28:11.000
no one was stopping you.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.100
no. you're wrong.

28:13.200 --> 28:18.500
for years,all it took was one word
- grace.

28:18.535 --> 28:20.700
what's this gonna do to her?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.565
i mean,i know you still love her.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.800
you think i don't know how
often you two see each other,

28:24.900 --> 28:25.900
how often you talk?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.600
leave her out of this.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.500
look. if you do this,you're not
just taking me down with you.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.065
grace was there,too.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.900
i didn't come asking
for permission this time.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.400
i didn't back down. i made my decision.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.800
how do you think that went over?

28:40.900 --> 28:42.065
why don't you tell me?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.800
the one night that ruined my life

28:43.900 --> 28:49.000
gave him
everything-grace-

28:49.100 --> 28:53.400
because i couldn't stand
the darkness between us-

28:53.500 --> 28:57.300
a career because one man's death

28:57.400 --> 29:01.000
drives another's decision to save lives,

29:01.100 --> 29:04.750
as if ryan cared about
anyone else but himself.

29:04.785 --> 29:08.400
you have to stop blaming
him for something you did.

29:08.435 --> 29:12.300
i know what i did on that road,

29:12.335 --> 29:14.500
but i didn't do this.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.800
i didn't kill myself.

29:16.835 --> 29:19.000
i wasn't a drug addict.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.500
whose life do you think
would be a lot better

29:21.535 --> 29:23.700
with me gone?

29:23.800 --> 29:26.400
are you saying ryan killed you?

29:26.500 --> 29:28.300
i'm dead,aren't i?

29:45.300 --> 29:46.500
eli.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.400
i know how ryan killed his friend.

29:49.435 --> 29:50.700
now we know that lucas was on

29:50.800 --> 29:52.950
some pretty hefty happy pills.

29:52.985 --> 29:55.100
you mean, antidepressants.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.800
yes. they were in his apartment,

29:56.900 --> 29:58.265
but he also had a prescription

29:58.300 --> 30:01.260
for some pretty hardy tranquilizers.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.600
now there's contraindications,

30:03.700 --> 30:06.500
meaning that's a very bad combo.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
he had to go to two
pharmacies and two doctors

30:08.700 --> 30:10.200
to get them filled.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.200
how do you know that?

30:11.300 --> 30:12.500
i'm a doctor.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.900
i called a few drug stores in hamilton.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.900
you're a ph. d., not an m.d.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.800
i'm not named dr. hellar either,

30:17.900 --> 30:19.200
but they didn't need to know that.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.500
ok. so we know that he
gave his best friend drugs.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.900
did he have any idea that the
combination would kill him?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
i should have changed.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.000
it is this guy's memorial.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.100
it's just a get-together
with old friends.

30:32.135 --> 30:34.100
besides,i don't think
we'll be staying long.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.000
you're not the only one
who's crashing the party.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.300
let's go.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.600
why? just...

30:42.700 --> 30:45.500
and i think in his own way

30:45.600 --> 30:47.865
he loved every single person here,

30:47.900 --> 30:51.200
and what i think that
he would want the most

30:51.300 --> 30:53.165
is for all of us to move forward,

30:53.200 --> 30:55.600
to find the things that
he was still searching for

30:55.635 --> 30:57.800
with the people that we love.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.400
grace and i are doing that.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.000
we're getting married.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.300
and when i say that
we lost our best man,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.600
i mean it in every sense of the word.

31:12.635 --> 31:15.400
we all did.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.400
to lucas.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.600
to lucas! to lucas!

31:19.700 --> 31:20.900
want to do something,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.400
or should i?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.500
we should go outside and talk.

31:28.535 --> 31:30.600
look. i know what grace told you,

31:30.700 --> 31:32.600
and there's a statute of limitations,

31:32.635 --> 31:33.865
even on obsessive guilt.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.000
you might want to restart the clock

31:35.100 --> 31:36.500
from the time that you
prescribed the medicine

31:36.600 --> 31:38.100
that killed your friend.

31:42.100 --> 31:45.400
tell me you didn't give him those drugs.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.265
grace,he came to me,ok?

31:48.300 --> 31:49.500
because he wanted to come clean.

31:49.535 --> 31:50.465
he told you that?

31:50.500 --> 31:52.900
yeah. he brought me up to speed

31:53.000 --> 31:55.100
on the plans that the
two of you made together.

31:55.135 --> 31:57.200
i met with him because he
had inherited some money

31:57.235 --> 31:58.400
and he wanted to put
it into a trust account

31:58.500 --> 32:00.000
for that man's daughter.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.700
he figured he could do some good,

32:01.800 --> 32:02.965
maybe get some peace.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.100
you couldn't let him
have that,could you?

32:05.135 --> 32:06.200
you would rather see him dead.

32:06.235 --> 32:10.900
ah,no.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.500
grace,wait!

32:13.900 --> 32:16.000
you think you're the only
person that cared about him?

32:16.035 --> 32:18.065
he was my best friend.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.400
i was just trying to make things ok.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.065
that's all i ever did.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.500
grace,it was our mistake that

32:23.600 --> 32:25.000
he was driving that car.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.500
it was our fault.

32:26.535 --> 32:27.900
that's the big secret

32:28.000 --> 32:29.400
that we never discuss.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.300
what happened that night,lucas?

32:31.400 --> 32:32.900
i think you know.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.100
you were so responsible,
such a good guy until...

32:37.135 --> 32:38.800
ryan: the party at binghamton.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.000
he's here,isn't he?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.900
since seventh grade,
we were best friends.

32:52.935 --> 32:54.200
on the first day of high school,

32:54.300 --> 32:58.500
he introduced me to the girl
that he'd met over summer,

32:58.600 --> 33:01.300
and every single day,
i fell harder for her.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.600
and nothing happened for so long...

33:05.700 --> 33:07.350
no,man. i'm good,thanks.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.442
until that stupid frat party

33:09.477 --> 33:11.500
at the end of the road trip.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.300
who was that?

33:29.100 --> 33:30.000
here you go,lucas.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.700
thanks,man.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.000
later,i tried to act
like nothing happened,

33:36.100 --> 33:37.865
and i realized that we all were

33:37.900 --> 33:40.600
and that lucas knew and
that's why he was drinking.

33:40.635 --> 33:41.900
it wasn't like him.

33:42.000 --> 33:52.200
it was our fault. we did this to him.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.100
leaving that guy on the road,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.500
i wasn't just protecting myself.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.400
i was protecting all of us,

33:59.500 --> 34:01.400
and when my best friend came to me,

34:01.500 --> 34:04.400
falling apart after 10 years,

34:04.500 --> 34:05.800
i just tried to do the same thing.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.300
i tried to save him...

34:08.400 --> 34:10.900
or at least,that's what
i thought i was doing.

34:10.935 --> 34:13.400
i didn't come asking
for permission this time.

34:13.500 --> 34:17.465
ryan,a man died because i was drinking,

34:17.500 --> 34:20.000
because we left him there like
he was some kind of animal.

34:20.034 --> 34:21.400
ahh,ahh.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.199
because i told you to.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.500
look. the guy was gone.

34:24.600 --> 34:25.800
there was nothing we could do.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.500
he had a wife and a kid.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.665
i can't live like this anymore.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.500
really? how are you gonna
live in a 10x10 cell?

34:31.600 --> 34:35.699
look. as your friend, i am begging you,

34:35.800 --> 34:37.800
please stop torturing yourself.

34:37.835 --> 34:41.100
if i don't do this,

34:41.199 --> 34:43.100
i think i'm gonna die.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.949
i can't get out of my head,

34:44.985 --> 34:46.699
i can't sleep, i can't think.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.500
you still seeing your shrink?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.364
i'm done with all that.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.264
whatever decision you
make,i'm behind you,

34:54.300 --> 34:57.300
but don't make a decision
like this without a clear head.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.700
look. you said you
haven't been sleeping.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.700
i'm gonna give you something,ok? yeah.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.900
you just take a couple of days.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.200
do that for me, all right?

35:07.235 --> 35:08.500
yeah.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.100
i told him don't mix
those pills with anything.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.600
i swear,

35:13.700 --> 35:15.100
and when i found out that he o.d.ed-

35:15.200 --> 35:17.365
ask him. please,melinda.

35:17.400 --> 35:22.400
if lucas is here, ask
him if that is true.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.200
he told me.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.000
but it wasn't the pills.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.400
it was the silence. i remember now.

35:34.435 --> 35:37.200
late at night every night.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.700
i hadn't slept for so long.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.300
the pills my shrink
had prescribed to me,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.100
they weren't helping,
they didn't do anything,

35:43.135 --> 35:46.800
so what harm could a sleeping pill do?

35:46.900 --> 35:48.400
i woke up again.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
it had to have been hours
since i took the first one.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.900
why wasn't i sleeping?

36:05.700 --> 36:07.700
i went out to my car to get headphones.

36:07.735 --> 36:09.100
i had neighbors,

36:09.200 --> 36:11.300
and next thing i know...

36:15.100 --> 36:17.500
i'm standing over my own body.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.700
i saw grace. she looked so sad,

36:20.800 --> 36:23.500
even before she found me.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.200
i needed to make them understand.

36:25.300 --> 36:30.600
the sadness,it just doesn't go away.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.265
lucas may not have realized it,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.400
but i think he was trying to save you.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.800
from what?

36:37.200 --> 36:39.900
from making the same mistake he did.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.665
he was afraid that if you kept

36:41.700 --> 36:45.200
your guilt a secret
it would ruin your life

36:45.300 --> 36:47.500
the way that it ruined his.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.065
lucas,i'm sorry.

36:51.100 --> 36:55.700
we are both so sorry.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.700
i didn't see it coming.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.900
my girlfriend, my best friend.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.400
did you? you saw everything
back in high school.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
you were always so quiet,

37:14.600 --> 37:17.600
taking it all in.

37:17.700 --> 37:21.400
you're asking me?

37:21.500 --> 37:23.900
what a difference 10 years makes.

37:31.500 --> 37:35.100
what i see now is that
it was an accident-

37:35.135 --> 37:37.700
the crash,your death, all of it.

37:37.800 --> 37:41.000
you made a mistake.

37:41.100 --> 37:42.300
it's time for you to move on

37:42.400 --> 37:45.900
and let your friends do the same.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.400
mrs. graber,these are the
two people i told you about.

38:00.500 --> 38:03.900
this is grace, and this is ryan.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.100
i hope she can forgive them.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.600
they're going to the authorities,

38:10.700 --> 38:12.100
they're taking responsibility.

38:12.135 --> 38:14.700
maybe that will help.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.100
i don't think she wants revenge.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.800
i think she wants to
know what it was like

38:19.900 --> 38:22.365
for her husband

38:22.400 --> 38:24.100
in those final moments.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.500
maybe she'll take comfort
in knowing he wasn't alone.

38:54.300 --> 38:57.500
all those years, you held it in

38:57.600 --> 38:59.900
for grace, for both of them.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.500
it's all i could think about

39:05.535 --> 39:06.800
my whole adult life.

39:06.900 --> 39:10.800
well,now you can just let go.

39:10.900 --> 39:13.500
but what comes next?

39:13.600 --> 39:15.800
the light.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.600
what's that like?

39:17.700 --> 39:19.900
i don't know.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.900
d- doesn't that
s- scare you?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.700
the light doesn't scare me.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.300
no,no,no.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.300
i'm talking about the unknown.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.300
i'm just like anyone else.

39:32.335 --> 39:34.200
of course it scares me.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.200
yeah.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.100
but it's ok to be scared.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.200
wow!

39:55.500 --> 39:59.400
take care of them, will you,all of them?

39:59.500 --> 40:02.000
i will.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.500
you're all right, meloony gordon.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.700
don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.900
hey.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
what are you doing?

40:43.100 --> 40:44.000
i lost your tear sheet,

40:44.100 --> 40:46.300
so i'm kind of winging it right now.

40:46.335 --> 40:48.500
no. i mean,i thought we were gonna wait

40:48.600 --> 40:49.700
until i got pregnant

40:49.800 --> 40:52.400
because then we would
still have 9 months.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.100
yeah. yeah, that was my plan.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.400
very logical, but,uh,didn't seem to

40:57.435 --> 40:59.200
make you very happy.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.000
it's not you.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.765
it's what i do.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.100
silly fears and anxieties,

41:10.200 --> 41:12.700
stupid things that ghosts say.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.100
like what?

41:17.300 --> 41:18.500
what?

41:22.200 --> 41:26.200
that there might be
a price for me to pay

41:26.300 --> 41:30.500
for what i do, putting myself

41:30.600 --> 41:34.400
in places where i might not belong.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.700
what kind of places?

41:35.800 --> 41:38.800
the unknown...

41:38.900 --> 41:40.400
death.

41:42.300 --> 41:46.400
you know,that's exactly why we do this.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.250
yeah. this project, all of it.

41:48.285 --> 41:50.000
i was wrong, you were right.

41:50.035 --> 41:51.000
why?

41:51.100 --> 41:52.100
because of what you do.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.465
every day,you know, you believe.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.700
we should believe that the right thing

41:55.800 --> 41:57.100
is gonna happen no matter what,

41:57.200 --> 41:59.800
so we just keep pushing
and pushing until it does.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.865
what if it doesn't?

42:02.900 --> 42:04.600
well,then we push some more.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.400
where did you learn to be so brave?

42:09.435 --> 42:11.167
where do you think?

42:11.202 --> 42:12.900
she's right here.
