WEBVTT

00:03.985 --> 00:05.696
Hurry. Get him inside.

00:09.741 --> 00:10.950
Put him on the table.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.000
Step back. Step back. Okay.

00:18.416 --> 00:21.128
It's okay, Dad.
We're home, we're home.

00:23.338 --> 00:25.882
You're home.
Give me something for the pain.

00:25.882 --> 00:27.133
Hold still.

00:29.136 --> 00:30.221
Here, this.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.557
Here we go.

00:34.891 --> 00:38.521
Okay, that's it. Relax.

00:40.898 --> 00:43.108
Okay, there you go.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.960
He's strong. He'll pull through.

01:11.219 --> 01:13.054
I want to be alone with him.

01:13.764 --> 01:15.099
Sure.

01:26.318 --> 01:28.154
He was really something out there.

03:13.175 --> 03:15.468
Garrett, potatoes are over there.

03:15.468 --> 03:17.138
Get them. I'll get these.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.724
Quit fucking around.

03:30.233 --> 03:33.696
Hey! What are you doing?
Get out of my shop!

03:39.243 --> 03:40.411
Stop!

03:41.536 --> 03:43.706
Don't fucking move!

03:48.169 --> 03:50.045
You boys are a bit far from home.

03:50.796 --> 03:52.672
What's in the bag, boys?

03:54.924 --> 03:56.259
Fuck!

03:58.888 --> 04:00.097
Morning, Bill.

04:15.028 --> 04:16.489
Hope I'm not intruding.

04:16.489 --> 04:19.700
Bill. Not at all.
You're a few minutes early.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.702
That's a good habit to cultivate.

04:22.327 --> 04:25.580
Well, we're going to have to do
something about those clothes though.

04:25.580 --> 04:26.748
Is there a problem?

04:27.332 --> 04:30.919
You start chucking concrete in those
shoes, you'll find out quick.

04:30.919 --> 04:33.756
Probably split a seam
in those trousers too.

04:35.924 --> 04:37.676
What size do you wear?

04:38.802 --> 04:40.095
Ten and a half.

04:44.558 --> 04:47.436
Now, these might be a little tight.
Give 'em a try.

04:48.770 --> 04:51.898
I was under the impression I was gonna
be working on the books.

04:51.898 --> 04:54.068
Well, I'm sorry if I wasn't clear, Bill.

04:54.068 --> 04:56.987
You'll have to start at the bottom,
like everyone else.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.197
It's a matter of perception.

04:59.197 --> 05:00.490
Perception?

05:00.490 --> 05:03.952
If my men were to see me give a family
member an unfair advantage,

05:03.952 --> 05:05.997
they'd lose all respect for me.

05:06.455 --> 05:07.914
Of course.

05:13.211 --> 05:14.797
A little early for you, isn't it?

05:15.131 --> 05:17.966
I need your help.

05:20.051 --> 05:22.555
My boys got arrested last night.

05:22.555 --> 05:26.267
They got themselves into a bit
of trouble with a chink grocer.

05:26.267 --> 05:30.104
In Chinatown? Jesus.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.982
Look, I'll be the first to admit my boys
aren't perfect,

05:32.982 --> 05:36.151
but they're just...
trying to feed themselves.

05:36.735 --> 05:38.779
That's why I gave 'em a fucking job.

05:39.447 --> 05:41.657
You're right. They fucked up.

05:42.491 --> 05:46.746
But they don't belong behind bars.

05:54.002 --> 05:55.295
I'll see what I can do.

06:14.773 --> 06:16.024
Fuck.

06:17.568 --> 06:21.405
Come here! Come back here,
you fucking whore! Come here!

06:21.405 --> 06:24.450
Ming Yu. Long time.

06:26.201 --> 06:28.995
Word is you brought my whores
back from the sticks.

06:28.995 --> 06:30.246
I came to get them.

06:30.246 --> 06:33.291
I don't know.
Your girls seem pretty happy here.

06:34.918 --> 06:38.380
That white bitch brought the bulls
to my place and stole my property.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.299
I'm reclaiming what's mine.

06:40.883 --> 06:44.929
You sure you want to whine about your
property while trespassing on mine?

06:47.682 --> 06:49.433
This is Hop Wei territory.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.062
Funny. They're not here now.

07:19.379 --> 07:20.715
Get him out of here.

07:31.183 --> 07:33.768
I didn't realize
you two knew each other.

07:34.352 --> 07:38.941
We appreciate you taking the time
to meet us. I know you're a busy man,

07:38.941 --> 07:40.942
what with campaigning,
running the city.

07:40.942 --> 07:43.696
Which is why I'm confident
you'll get right to the point.

07:45.615 --> 07:50.118
We'd like to make things easier for you.
Grease the wheels, as it were.

07:51.244 --> 07:54.289
I'd gladly welcome a donation
to my campaign fund.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.084
Fuckin' hell.

07:59.836 --> 08:03.048
You like your conversation fast
and blunt, Mr. Buckley,

08:03.048 --> 08:04.383
so I'll be both.

08:04.383 --> 08:08.554
No amount of money will give you
what you need to win this race.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.722
And what's that?

08:12.141 --> 08:15.602
Charm, grace, personality.

08:16.186 --> 08:18.855
The charisma to win the hearts
and minds of the people,

08:18.855 --> 08:21.983
something Mr. Thayer has in spades.

08:22.944 --> 08:24.111
I see.

08:26.447 --> 08:31.201
I appreciate your perspective,
but if you'll excuse me.

08:31.201 --> 08:34.038
Please sit down, Mr. Buckley.
You're gonna want to hear this.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.130
I've spoken to Mr. Thayer,

08:43.130 --> 08:47.843
and it seems that despite his vision
for the future of this city,

08:47.843 --> 08:49.679
he's having second thoughts.

08:50.179 --> 08:52.055
Second thoughts?

08:54.557 --> 09:00.146
That's right. Some folks just don't have
the stomach for politics.

09:02.983 --> 09:04.818
Well, it's not for everyone.

09:05.653 --> 09:07.113
No, it is not.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.117
I don't like owing people favors.

09:12.784 --> 09:16.247
Then maybe you don't have
the stomach for it either.

09:17.455 --> 09:18.790
It's very simple, Mr. Buckley.

09:18.790 --> 09:22.878
Mr. Leary and I can hand you the race,
right here, right now.

09:22.878 --> 09:24.379
And in exchange,

09:24.379 --> 09:28.467
you are going to make sure
that our interests are looked after.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.760
Am I clear?

09:47.861 --> 09:52.032
Looks like we're bringing out
the expensive shit tonight. Huh?

09:52.907 --> 09:54.660
Gonna offer me some?

09:55.870 --> 09:58.038
You know where the glasses are.

09:59.289 --> 10:02.627
Abigail, don't mourn so much.

10:03.376 --> 10:08.633
Getting mixed up with that cop
was only gonna end one way.

10:09.883 --> 10:12.218
- Which way is that?
- The bad way.

10:13.928 --> 10:17.600
Comes a time when every man's got
to answer for his shit.

10:17.932 --> 10:19.435
Simple as that.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.520
I reckon that goes for you, too.

10:29.111 --> 10:30.445
You lied to me.

10:30.445 --> 10:32.030
I was trying to look out for you.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.793
You fuckers should have stayed
where I sent you.

10:45.503 --> 10:47.420
We like here better.

10:49.089 --> 10:51.634
Not too sure about you though.

10:51.966 --> 10:55.470
Yeah? What the fuck are
you gonna do about it, cop?

10:56.680 --> 10:58.515
He's not going to do anything.

11:19.954 --> 11:21.454
The deal was done.

11:22.831 --> 11:26.501
All we had to do was ride out of there.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.506
He was just a kid.

11:32.507 --> 11:33.967
You had to do something.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.138
I don't think Young Jun sees it
that way.

11:39.014 --> 11:40.683
Not with Father Jun getting shot.

11:44.352 --> 11:46.647
I feel like every time I try
to do the right thing,

11:46.647 --> 11:48.357
I just fuck things up even worse.

11:52.778 --> 11:56.657
Maybe that's because you haven't
decided which side you're on.

12:05.749 --> 12:13.090
In the riot, you weren't fighting
for Hop Wei or Long Zii,

12:13.090 --> 12:15.675
you were fighting for what was right.

12:16.886 --> 12:18.136
That means something.

12:18.887 --> 12:23.183
I was just trying to stay alive,
like everyone else.

12:24.642 --> 12:26.728
But you're not like everyone else.

12:31.566 --> 12:32.734
You're not.

12:34.612 --> 12:35.820
You...

12:39.115 --> 12:42.494
You are so much more
than what Young Jun

12:42.494 --> 12:45.831
or your sister want you to be.
You have to know that.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.104
I'm gonna show you something.

13:15.986 --> 13:18.989
I can't just wait around
for things to change.

13:20.491 --> 13:24.327
When my father dies and my brother
takes over the shop, then what?

13:33.169 --> 13:35.797
So, I'll do Young Jun's dirty work
for now if that's what it takes,

13:35.797 --> 13:38.049
but I need to look after
my own future.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.858
You've been stealing from us?

13:54.441 --> 13:57.612
I'm just printing a few extras.
No one's gonna know.

13:59.279 --> 14:01.364
- If Young Jun finds out...
- He's not.

14:01.364 --> 14:03.700
He won't unless you tell him.

14:07.579 --> 14:09.456
This money buys me a future.

14:10.958 --> 14:12.667
Or at least a chance at one.

14:12.667 --> 14:16.672
I can get on a train. I can go
somewhere far. I can start over.

14:20.843 --> 14:26.307
You have to promise me
not to take any more. Okay?

14:26.890 --> 14:28.183
Okay.

14:38.526 --> 14:41.197
You're a soldier. Listen to me!
You are the tong!

14:41.197 --> 14:44.240
Dad. What are you doing?
You should be in bed.

14:46.451 --> 14:49.914
We can't take the navy head on.
They've got too many ships.

14:49.914 --> 14:51.499
What are you talking about?

14:51.499 --> 14:54.292
What am I talking about?
Those fucking cannons.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.963
- They'll blow our men to pieces.
- Dad, dad, easy.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.506
We need to attack at night!

14:58.506 --> 15:01.466
You're bleeding through your bandages.

15:12.519 --> 15:14.814
There's too many of them.

15:16.564 --> 15:19.360
It's going to be okay. Just rest.

15:43.634 --> 15:46.302
What the fuck is this?
Where's Bill?

15:47.178 --> 15:50.598
My guess is he's sleeping off
a raging hangover.

15:51.434 --> 15:54.395
- He fucking quit.
- Get the fuck out of here.

15:56.147 --> 15:57.398
What happened?

15:57.815 --> 16:00.108
You'll have to ask the new Chief
about that.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.374
- Chief Atwood.
- Do you have an appointment?

16:16.208 --> 16:18.585
I'm Dylan Leary.
We haven't met yet, but...

16:18.585 --> 16:21.505
I know who you are. If there is
something you want to discuss,

16:21.505 --> 16:23.633
come back when
you have an appointment.

16:27.678 --> 16:32.099
Look, I've always had a good
relationship with the boys in blue.

16:33.017 --> 16:35.310
A relationship that works
for both sides.

16:47.656 --> 16:50.993
There's a couple of boys
in your holding cell who got drunk

16:51.744 --> 16:53.536
and did something stupid.

16:56.207 --> 16:57.500
I know these lads,

16:59.085 --> 17:01.545
and they were only trying
to feed their families.

17:08.802 --> 17:11.763
If you'd see fit
to cut 'em a little slack,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.766
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

17:17.561 --> 17:20.189
I went through hard times
as a young man, too.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.321
But I never broke the law.

17:29.949 --> 17:33.827
They robbed a fucking Chinaman.
They're not criminals.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.040
Let's take a look.

17:41.001 --> 17:45.089
Conor and Garrett Donahue.
Breaking and entering,

17:45.589 --> 17:50.303
larceny. Let's add assaulting
an officer while we're at it.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.432
I'm in the business of law and order.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.644
My predecessor might have turned
a blind eye to drunken thuggery,

17:58.644 --> 18:00.104
but it's a new day.

18:04.482 --> 18:06.526
You sure this is how
you want to play this?

18:11.740 --> 18:13.659
I'm dead fucking certain.

18:15.870 --> 18:17.580
You're not Irish, are you?

18:18.414 --> 18:21.916
No. I'm an American.

18:23.919 --> 18:26.629
Well, no one's perfect.

18:57.828 --> 18:59.080
Fuck's sake.

19:01.831 --> 19:03.416
Leave the door open.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.964
How's it going out there, Bill?

19:08.923 --> 19:10.049
No complaints.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.843
Actually, there have been a few.

19:12.843 --> 19:15.179
The foreman says
you're lagging behind the others.

19:15.595 --> 19:17.764
I'm still learning the ropes.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.518
Patrick and Dylan are lapping you
out there.

19:20.518 --> 19:23.854
And those boys aren't much smarter
than the rocks they're hauling.

19:23.854 --> 19:25.772
They're also half my age.

19:27.065 --> 19:30.069
Well, I hope you don't think
this kind of work is beneath you.

19:35.116 --> 19:36.659
I'll do better tomorrow.

19:37.993 --> 19:39.537
That's the spirit, Bill.

19:48.420 --> 19:52.382
- This doesn't get easier.
- Just keep practicing.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.109
Hi.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.154
Hello.

20:14.821 --> 20:17.365
Would you mind giving us a moment?

20:17.991 --> 20:21.203
Of course. I will wait right outside.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.210
Excellent manners.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.259
Not really your type.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.888
Not really your business.

20:39.680 --> 20:45.560
Fair enough.
I don't know if you heard,

20:45.560 --> 20:49.189
but Li Yong and I are engaged.

20:50.774 --> 20:51.943
I did.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.657
Congratulations.

20:58.114 --> 21:01.785
Thank you.
I'd like you to be at the wedding.

21:06.998 --> 21:09.250
Because we're in business together?

21:10.252 --> 21:12.004
Because you're my brother.

21:21.639 --> 21:22.847
Okay.

21:23.557 --> 21:24.933
Good.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.401
Bring your friend, too.

21:43.077 --> 21:45.705
You smell that? Mr. Wu.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.665
- Yes, sir.
- Bag of chestnuts.

21:50.250 --> 21:54.421
Thanks. You have to try these.
He roasts them with sugar.

21:55.089 --> 21:57.091
Well, do I just...

21:59.884 --> 22:02.470
Here, you have to peel it. Like this.

22:03.431 --> 22:05.640
Who says chivalry is dead?

22:06.767 --> 22:08.435
Wow, that is good.

22:10.770 --> 22:14.983
So, I'm thinking about staying
in San Francisco a little longer.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.904
I've been offered a residency.
It's only a few weeks, but...

22:22.658 --> 22:26.329
Well, if you're gonna stick around,

22:27.203 --> 22:28.788
you better learn.

22:33.836 --> 22:36.547
Come back here.
You can't leave me like that.

22:43.012 --> 22:44.513
Son of a bitch.

22:49.310 --> 22:51.896
Ethan won't stop going on
about trains.

22:53.147 --> 22:55.899
Horace promised him a trip
when the weather turns.

22:56.317 --> 22:58.110
That's mighty generous of him.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.032
You must be sore.

23:03.658 --> 23:05.867
Working in a few new muscles is all.

23:06.744 --> 23:08.370
So, it's going all right then?

23:08.370 --> 23:11.790
Yeah. Foreman says I'm making
the other fellas look bad.

23:12.832 --> 23:14.918
And most of them are half my age.

23:16.837 --> 23:19.839
Well, I'm sure Horace will have
you working the books in no time.

23:19.839 --> 23:22.467
I talked to Maggie
about moving things along.

23:23.469 --> 23:27.848
In the meantime, what am I going to do
about having this big strong man

23:27.848 --> 23:29.350
in the house?

23:31.227 --> 23:33.062
I'm hoping you'll get used to it.

23:38.191 --> 23:40.403
Don't stay in here all night.

24:23.613 --> 24:24.864
Fucking hell!

24:27.449 --> 24:29.284
The fuck? You crazy chink!

24:57.313 --> 24:59.273
I wondered where you made off to.

25:05.655 --> 25:07.698
You gonna tell me
what happened out there?

25:10.367 --> 25:11.660
Someday.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.247
Right now,
I'd rather think about the future.

25:20.001 --> 25:23.547
This future you're so sweet on
isn't gonna be any easier.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.342
Inside these four walls,
we're good. But outside...

25:27.342 --> 25:28.552
Yep, yep.

25:34.225 --> 25:36.352
I never told you how my husband died.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.359
You don't have to.

25:43.984 --> 25:45.486
No. You need to understand.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.614
Happy Jack's always been
a self-serving asshole.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.324
But his brother Wesley
was a good man.

25:52.785 --> 25:55.955
He had a job down at the docks.
It didn't pay much,

25:55.955 --> 25:59.041
but it was honest work,
and that's what mattered to him.

26:00.208 --> 26:04.213
One night, he was walking home
and ran into some white boys

26:04.213 --> 26:08.008
out looking for trouble.
It was four against one.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.555
And both sides were bloodied up
by the time the cops came.

26:13.263 --> 26:15.015
Wes tried to tell them what happened.

26:15.890 --> 26:19.145
But they saw the color of his skin
and decided he was in the wrong.

26:22.063 --> 26:29.071
When the cops tried to cuff him
and he resisted, they shot him.

26:32.908 --> 26:36.329
Being good didn't get
my husband anywhere, but dead.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.292
So, when Happy Jack asked me
to work for him, I said yes.

26:41.708 --> 26:45.587
Fact is, you gotta be crooked
to get along in a crooked world.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.343
Do you regret what we did to Jack?

26:50.343 --> 26:53.636
God, no. Wes didn't get enough time
on this green earth.

26:55.221 --> 26:59.185
The way I see it, Happy Jack got
more than his share.

27:07.400 --> 27:11.613
There she is.
Another day, another dollar.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.657
Young Jun.

27:17.077 --> 27:18.579
What's going on?

27:20.538 --> 27:22.249
We need to ramp up production.

27:22.832 --> 27:25.586
Splitting our take
with the Long Zii is killing us.

27:25.586 --> 27:28.338
Well, there's only so much I can do
by myself.

27:28.338 --> 27:30.090
Yeah, I figured.

27:30.090 --> 27:34.178
I want you to train my men on the press.
Teach them everything you know.

27:38.808 --> 27:42.394
Printing like this
is a delicate process.

27:43.020 --> 27:48.025
Not everyone can do it.
And even if they are capable,

27:48.025 --> 27:51.612
it's gonna be months before they make
anything that you could actually use.

27:54.656 --> 27:56.909
Then I guess you better get started.

27:58.202 --> 28:00.370
Hey, don't take it personally.
It's just business.

28:01.371 --> 28:04.249
I mean, what if something
were to happen to you?

28:05.751 --> 28:09.004
I'd lose the only set of hands
capable of making my chop.

28:28.732 --> 28:31.943
Well, look at that,
a dead man pouring drinks.

28:34.529 --> 28:36.699
I asked you to contact me
if you heard from him.

28:36.699 --> 28:39.035
Lucky for me,
I don't work for you.

28:42.163 --> 28:44.040
That one's a spitfire, isn't she?

28:45.790 --> 28:48.169
Someone sure cleaned
your plough good.

28:48.169 --> 28:51.421
What, this? I've had worse.

29:03.141 --> 29:06.979
You're starting to make a habit out
of handing in badges, aren't you?

29:10.650 --> 29:12.275
What happened to you?

29:15.613 --> 29:17.822
My family won't be coming after me anymore,

29:17.822 --> 29:21.451
which means I no longer need
the Service's protection.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.246
Not that it did me much good anyway.

29:24.956 --> 29:27.916
Funny, I didn't peg your kin
as the forgiving type.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.627
You must be mighty persuasive.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.589
You take care of yourself,
Agent Moseley.

29:34.172 --> 29:37.133
I've grown to like you, Mr. Lee,
in my way,

29:38.052 --> 29:40.930
which is why I'm gonna do you
the courtesy of speaking straight.

29:42.263 --> 29:46.102
I just took a bullet for you and nearly
gave up the goddamn ghost.

29:46.102 --> 29:48.145
Now, someone's gonna pay for that.

29:48.938 --> 29:50.564
It's not my fight anymore.

29:51.439 --> 29:54.694
I disagree, as does
the federal government.

29:55.486 --> 29:58.446
Now, family matters aside, you still
have a murder charge to contend with.

29:58.446 --> 30:01.908
And that doesn't go away until
I say it does, which I will do

30:02.909 --> 30:05.621
as soon as those plates
are in my hands.

30:07.498 --> 30:11.292
But we're past sticks and carrots,
aren't we?

30:21.262 --> 30:22.220
Ming Yu.

30:22.638 --> 30:25.141
Ah Toy has come here at my request

30:25.141 --> 30:29.686
as a demonstration of her respect
and her desire to resolve the issue.

30:32.773 --> 30:36.568
I don't give a shit about her respect.
I want my whores back.

30:37.486 --> 30:40.823
I didn't steal the girls.
I gave them a place to stay.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.575
They don't belong to anyone.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.161
No one is buying into
your high and mighty act.

30:46.161 --> 30:48.873
You make your money selling pussy,
same as me.

30:50.207 --> 30:54.128
Ah Toy, I'm not going to ask you
to hand over the girls.

30:54.128 --> 30:56.588
But Ming Yu's business
is under my protection.

30:56.588 --> 31:00.092
To that end, I would like to see him
compensated for his loss.

31:15.483 --> 31:19.445
This is an insult. My girls make
more than this in a month.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.281
There would have been more,
but you owe me a new table.

31:27.577 --> 31:29.372
You think you can fuck with me
like this?

31:29.372 --> 31:31.916
Ming Yu, sit down.

31:34.585 --> 31:36.379
Sit down!

31:41.383 --> 31:44.844
You lost your girls to the bulls,
not to Ah Toy.

31:44.844 --> 31:46.514
By rights, she owes you nothing,

31:46.514 --> 31:48.391
and she's offering you
more than you deserve.

31:48.391 --> 31:51.017
Now take it,
and stop wasting my time.

32:00.777 --> 32:03.990
Good. Li Yong will walk you out.

32:17.044 --> 32:21.924
The last time I saw you, you were
lying in bed, bleeding to death.

32:23.050 --> 32:25.886
And the Irish were tearing our streets
to pieces.

32:26.679 --> 32:30.057
One of these days, we must meet
under friendlier circumstances.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.020
I don't know if you've heard,
but I'm getting married.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.980
I did. Congratulations.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.608
Consider yourself invited.

32:41.943 --> 32:44.029
Friendlier circumstances, right?

32:44.738 --> 32:46.741
I'm honored. Thank you.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.788
Your new place is very... Chinese.

32:52.788 --> 32:54.290
You don't like it?

32:54.874 --> 32:56.207
It's beautiful.

32:56.541 --> 33:00.211
But? You can speak freely to me.

33:02.673 --> 33:06.718
It's very traditional. Like the version
of us the Ducks expect.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.804
Their ideas, not yours.

33:11.348 --> 33:17.730
Our future here must be as Americans,
not as an exotic cultural curiosity.

33:18.856 --> 33:20.149
It was a strategy.

33:20.982 --> 33:24.528
A way to lure them in,
but perhaps that was a mistake.

33:26.364 --> 33:29.158
The only mistake was assuming
that appealing to them

33:29.158 --> 33:31.743
would change how they treat us.

33:31.743 --> 33:36.248
We belong here, Mai Ling.
Even if the Ducks don't know it yet.

33:55.141 --> 33:56.852
Hey. Where's Father Jun?

33:56.852 --> 33:58.187
He went out.

33:59.146 --> 34:02.108
The fuck you mean he went out?
Why didn't you stop him?

34:03.024 --> 34:05.819
- He's Father Jun.
- You fucking moron.

34:14.328 --> 34:17.372
Father Jun, find him! You two,
that way! You two, with me!

34:28.718 --> 34:30.051
What the fuck is all this then?

34:30.761 --> 34:33.680
I got jumped by a mob of chinks
outside The Pearl.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.557
There must've been a dozen
of the fuckers.

34:35.557 --> 34:39.103
If they attacked him there,
they'll attack us anywhere!

34:39.103 --> 34:41.105
- Hold on! Everyone calm down.
- Fuck that!

34:41.105 --> 34:43.940
I say we show these slants
who they're messing with!

34:49.447 --> 34:52.158
I said hold the fuck on!

34:53.367 --> 34:56.495
- You trying to start another riot?
- They are the ones that started it.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.665
We lost good men that day.

35:01.333 --> 35:05.545
Sons. Brothers. Friends.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.800
And what did all that loss accomplish?

35:11.093 --> 35:12.511
Not a goddamn thing.

35:13.012 --> 35:16.264
- Just seems like you've given up.
- Given up?

35:19.018 --> 35:21.686
We are weeks away
from having a mayor

35:21.686 --> 35:24.231
who's gonna ban Chinese labor
once and for all.

35:25.232 --> 35:28.819
Hundreds of jobs are about to come
our way. And who did that?

35:29.986 --> 35:33.532
Was it you, going whoring
and getting your ass kicked?

35:35.116 --> 35:36.827
Was it any of yous?

35:41.082 --> 35:45.960
I am the only one looking out
for you lot, day after day.

35:47.003 --> 35:50.466
Defending you against men
who see you as thugs and hooligans.

35:53.135 --> 35:55.554
No better than the chinks,
just more expensive.

35:57.264 --> 35:59.683
You want to go out
and prove them right?

35:59.683 --> 36:03.228
Because I can tell you,
no one's gonna hire you then.

36:05.397 --> 36:08.400
And tomorrow morning,
when the whiskey clears,

36:09.610 --> 36:13.322
you'll either be sleeping it off
in a cell or right back here,

36:14.031 --> 36:17.451
bitching and moaning how
your families are going hungry.

36:19.452 --> 36:23.416
And this time, I'll have to tell you
you're shit out of luck.

36:25.542 --> 36:27.461
You lot stay the fuck put.

36:31.881 --> 36:33.383
I'll handle the Chinese.

37:00.244 --> 37:01.578
Fucking hell.

37:09.919 --> 37:11.546
Hey, don't move unless I say.

37:17.344 --> 37:19.138
What the fuck are you doing here?

37:19.138 --> 37:21.473
Relax. I'm not here for a fight.

37:22.932 --> 37:24.352
Do I look worried?

37:25.560 --> 37:29.023
A few of your boys attacked an Irishman
minding his own business last night.

37:29.023 --> 37:30.524
Beat him pretty badly.

37:30.524 --> 37:32.026
Shit happens.

37:32.026 --> 37:35.987
Yeah, well, I'm trying to stop that shit
from turning into a full-blown riot.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.909
I figure you hand over those boys,
we'll call it even.

37:40.659 --> 37:45.997
Sure. As soon as you give us the men
who robbed one of our grocers.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.750
Those lads are already locked up.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.377
Sounds like a no deal then.

37:53.254 --> 37:56.050
- My people are out for blood.
- So, what are they waiting for?

37:56.050 --> 37:58.468
We both know what'll happen
if I let 'em go.

38:01.638 --> 38:03.808
Since when do you care
what happens in Chinatown?

38:04.850 --> 38:09.021
I don't. I care about what happens
to my people.

38:10.231 --> 38:12.275
Your men crossed the line.

38:12.275 --> 38:14.277
Kind of like you're doing right now.

38:15.151 --> 38:17.112
I'm just delivering a message.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.616
Keep the Chinese
out of our fucking neighborhood.

38:24.619 --> 38:26.289
I got some bad news for you.

38:32.044 --> 38:33.587
I don't control Chinatown.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.927
There's a 10-foot fucking portrait
on a wall says otherwise.

38:40.635 --> 38:43.556
I'll keep my boys in
if you keep yours out.

38:44.347 --> 38:45.890
And maybe between the two of us,

38:46.516 --> 38:48.686
we keep a bunch of people
from ending up dead.

38:55.443 --> 38:57.153
I'll do what I can.

39:04.327 --> 39:08.039
You know, the politicians
would love nothing more

39:08.039 --> 39:09.707
than for us to kill each other.

39:09.707 --> 39:12.209
Then who would build their cities?

39:13.127 --> 39:15.086
There's always another group
of desperate fucks willing to do

39:15.086 --> 39:16.255
their dirty work.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.638
It's funny. I've never been
to Chinatown before.

39:25.306 --> 39:26.807
Don't make a habit of it.

39:27.515 --> 39:28.893
Don't give me a reason to.

39:36.399 --> 39:37.860
What do you want to do?

39:39.362 --> 39:46.077
Put out the word. Anyone who goes
into the pond answers to me.

39:51.207 --> 39:54.209
Long Zii, you son of a bitch!

39:54.961 --> 39:57.420
Come out and face me like a man!

39:58.797 --> 40:01.383
Come on! Come on, Long Zii!

40:06.472 --> 40:10.225
Yeah? You sent these hatchets
to fight me?

40:11.143 --> 40:13.229
I'll dice every one of you fucks,

40:14.562 --> 40:16.899
and still have enough left
for that dog cunt!

40:18.442 --> 40:19.693
Coward!

40:22.404 --> 40:25.532
Show me what you've got.
Come on.

40:30.454 --> 40:32.623
You fucking onion. Come on.
Show me something.

40:32.623 --> 40:35.668
Show me what you got.
What, you're afraid?

40:36.127 --> 40:38.962
What is it, dog?
Is this the best you got?

40:38.962 --> 40:41.131
Get inside. All of you.

40:42.466 --> 40:45.218
Where are you going?
Where the fuck is Long Zii?

40:51.851 --> 40:54.769
I've looked everywhere.
No one's seen him.

40:54.769 --> 40:56.104
He'll be back, brother.

40:56.104 --> 40:59.525
He's probably just blowing
some chop at the fan tan tables.

41:02.111 --> 41:03.321
What the fuck?

41:12.705 --> 41:14.998
Dad. Are you okay?

41:20.754 --> 41:22.006
Are you okay?

41:22.006 --> 41:26.177
I don't know what's...

41:27.345 --> 41:30.973
He got lost. But he is fine.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.563
Dad...

41:38.563 --> 41:43.777
What's going on?
Please, I don't know...

41:48.448 --> 41:51.327
It's okay. You're home.

41:52.662 --> 41:54.872
- This is your home.
- Home?

41:55.205 --> 41:58.125
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Home...

42:00.752 --> 42:02.337
Come on, Dad.

42:09.387 --> 42:10.513
Let's go inside.

42:11.846 --> 42:13.473
Come on, Father Jun.

43:11.574 --> 43:16.287
You. You have any idea what you did?

43:16.787 --> 43:18.455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

43:22.460 --> 43:24.503
You play stupid, you get hit.

43:24.503 --> 43:27.339
Your idiot friends here
been bragging all over town.

43:27.339 --> 43:29.133
I just did what you would have done.

43:29.133 --> 43:31.176
No, I'm not that stupid.

43:31.176 --> 43:34.430
We're this close to all hell
breaking loose 'cause of you.

43:34.430 --> 43:36.681
You want another riot here?

43:36.681 --> 43:38.350
If that's what it takes.

43:41.270 --> 43:44.564
Maybe you don't remember because
you were hiding with your daddy,

43:44.564 --> 43:46.816
but people died. A lot of them.

43:47.526 --> 43:50.154
Now the ducks are looking
for any reason to kill us,

43:50.154 --> 43:51.530
and you just gave 'em one.

43:54.115 --> 43:57.912
If they come back,
that blood will be on your hands.

44:00.623 --> 44:03.875
You tell your friends,
anyone else gets itchy,

44:03.875 --> 44:07.087
I will fucking hear about it.
You get me?

44:09.465 --> 44:13.427
Good. Now go home.
Go, go!

44:14.470 --> 44:16.180
Show's over.

44:24.813 --> 44:27.692
Sending away customers
isn't great for business.

44:28.316 --> 44:29.484
I know.

44:33.154 --> 44:36.033
- Sorry about that.
- What'd he do?

44:38.452 --> 44:43.332
Something stupid. And now the Irish
are ready to come in here

44:43.332 --> 44:45.083
and tear things up again.

44:48.670 --> 44:50.422
Kind of inevitable, isn't it?

44:52.216 --> 44:55.635
Someday, maybe. But not tonight.

45:00.057 --> 45:03.019
Didn't you throw some onion
over the banister the other day?

45:03.602 --> 45:05.646
Technically, Lai kicked him over.

45:10.484 --> 45:11.861
That's usually my job.

45:12.903 --> 45:16.281
Yeah. But from what I hear,
you've got your own problems.

45:25.790 --> 45:28.877
So, you going to Mai Ling's wedding?

45:32.214 --> 45:35.133
Yeah. How about you?

45:39.846 --> 45:43.433
I have been saving a dress
for a special occasion.

45:44.769 --> 45:46.228
Another one?

45:48.271 --> 45:49.607
Of course you have.

45:55.321 --> 45:56.529
Mr. Strickland.

46:14.632 --> 46:17.093
You must be quite happy with yourself.

46:17.593 --> 46:20.470
You got what you wanted.
I'm dropping out of the race.

46:20.470 --> 46:25.183
Well, that's a shame. You seemed
to have a real knack for campaigning.

46:26.936 --> 46:28.562
I was certainly thrashing you.

46:29.730 --> 46:31.856
It's ironic, actually,

46:33.608 --> 46:37.446
how despite everything, you're still
the one who warrants pity.

46:38.364 --> 46:41.825
I have a family I love,
things I believe in.

46:41.825 --> 46:43.119
What do you have?

46:45.495 --> 46:49.333
Not even a friend to share
a celebratory drink with.

46:50.250 --> 46:54.005
Because everybody knows
what kind of man you really are.

46:59.385 --> 47:00.677
Unlike you.

47:02.178 --> 47:04.640
A soft, entitled man of middling charm

47:04.640 --> 47:06.726
who inherited his wealth yet clings
to the notion

47:06.726 --> 47:10.020
that he accomplished something
beyond an accident of birth.

47:11.397 --> 47:14.442
You never fought
for a single thing in your life.

47:15.109 --> 47:19.446
And that's why men like you will
always be undone by men like me.

47:19.446 --> 47:22.115
- Listen to me, Walter...
- This conversation is over.

47:22.115 --> 47:26.661
I suggest you go home and spend some
time with that lovely family of yours.

47:36.464 --> 47:39.884
I hear congratulations are in order,
Mister Mayor.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.895
Winning suits you, Walter.

47:51.896 --> 47:54.439
Yes, it does.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.273
You good, boss?

48:38.985 --> 48:40.652
Not really, Hong.

48:42.195 --> 48:45.949
My father's losing his fucking mind

48:47.993 --> 48:50.078
because my best friend had
to play hero.

48:50.662 --> 48:53.289
And now we're shoveling shit
for his sister.

48:55.167 --> 48:57.044
Are you sensing a pattern here?

48:57.877 --> 49:01.882
The last thing he wanted
was to make a deal with Mai Ling.

49:02.549 --> 49:03.884
He did it to help you.

49:03.884 --> 49:06.845
I suppose he's fucking that
printer girl to help me too, right?

49:08.597 --> 49:10.515
We're supposed to be brothers.

49:11.516 --> 49:14.602
And now I got to find out what
he's been up to from Mai Ling?

49:16.397 --> 49:18.065
It's fucking bullshit!

49:24.196 --> 49:27.950
We've let too many goddamn fucking
outsiders in.

49:30.368 --> 49:33.080
The Hop Wei has to come first.

49:34.707 --> 49:38.209
But Ah Sahm,
I'm not sure he believes that.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.548
If we can get rich
without dicing each other,

49:42.548 --> 49:44.966
maybe this partnership isn't so bad.

49:46.509 --> 49:50.055
Sometimes I forget
just how fresh you are, man.

49:51.014 --> 49:54.184
Peace never lasts.

49:54.184 --> 49:57.229
And when this deal
with Mai Ling blows up,

49:57.229 --> 50:01.192
I'm gonna need soldiers
who are loyal to me.

50:02.525 --> 50:04.487
And when it comes to Ah Sahm...

50:05.529 --> 50:07.739
He'd dice or die for you, boss.

50:10.743 --> 50:12.203
I'm not sure about that.
