00:20.024 --> 00:21.225
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.259 --> 00:23.161
Let him go.

00:24.762 --> 00:25.997
You did this.

00:25.998 --> 00:29.733
<i>This whole journey you've
taken with your friends.</i>

00:29.766 --> 00:31.835
Gar.

00:31.868 --> 00:33.868
You brought me
here, Rachel.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.441
<i>It's all been to make
this moment happen.</i>

00:38.443 --> 00:40.744
<i>It's heartbreaking,
isn't it?</i>

00:40.779 --> 00:44.682
<i>Your purpose was to bring me
into your world.</i>

00:44.715 --> 00:47.317
<i>Let your heart break.</i>

00:47.351 --> 00:49.753
<i>You're a monster inside.</i>

00:49.786 --> 00:51.755
<i>A bringer of death.</i>

00:51.789 --> 00:53.156
We have a solid plan.

00:53.191 --> 00:55.125
<i>We shut this operation down
for good.</i>

00:55.158 --> 00:56.627
Hank!

00:56.659 --> 00:58.195
No!

00:58.228 --> 01:00.131
<i>You can nurse me
back to health.</i>

01:00.164 --> 01:03.968
Two fractures, three concussions in
the last year, and a herniated disc.

01:04.001 --> 01:06.137
He should quit.
You both should.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.405
<i>That's the plan.</i>

01:07.438 --> 01:10.408
- And we will, right?
- As promised.

01:10.441 --> 01:13.009
I've been thinkin'
about San Francisco.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.045
Titans again.

01:14.078 --> 01:15.679
Titans are back, bitches!

01:15.680 --> 01:17.214
You're kind of an asshole,
aren't you, kid?

01:17.215 --> 01:18.810
Maybe it's time
for a do-over.

01:18.811 --> 01:21.885
If there's anything you need,
you let me know.

01:21.918 --> 01:23.718
<i>On one condition.</i>

01:25.456 --> 01:27.756
What is this place?

01:27.825 --> 01:28.825
Home.

01:36.834 --> 01:40.937
Got a triple venti mocha for Rochelle
and a small coffee for Dirk.

01:40.938 --> 01:41.970
Dick.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.075
Excuse me?

01:44.108 --> 01:45.343
Oh. Uh...

01:45.376 --> 01:48.212
- Never mind. Here.
- Nice.

01:48.245 --> 01:51.781
So, have you put any thought
into our name?

01:51.814 --> 01:53.685
What do you mean?

01:53.718 --> 01:56.953
Well, you, Hank, Dawn, and Donna
were the Titans.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.489
So, what are we?
The New Titans?

01:59.524 --> 02:02.959
- Titans 2.0?
- Titans: The Next Generation?

02:02.992 --> 02:04.295
You're not helping.

02:04.328 --> 02:06.039
Look, Rach, it doesn't
matter what you're called.

02:06.063 --> 02:08.532
It matters what you do. We're
training for whatever's next.

02:08.566 --> 02:10.366
There's never a shortage
of people out there

02:10.366 --> 02:12.068
who wanna screw things up
for the rest of us.

02:12.069 --> 02:14.371
You know what they say,
"All it takes for evil to succeed..."

02:14.372 --> 02:16.074
"Is for good men and women
to do nothing."

02:16.108 --> 02:20.243
That's Titans. Good men and
women not doing nothing.

02:20.277 --> 02:22.377
You could put that
on a T-shirt, Dirk.

02:30.587 --> 02:34.658
When I give the word, come
at me, and don't hold back.

02:34.692 --> 02:39.692
- Did you just nod?
- Yeah, got it. Just don't hold back.

02:40.163 --> 02:41.163
Go!

03:25.877 --> 03:27.846
- Fuck, man!
- You said don't hold back.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.979
What were you doing?
I was fucking blindfolded.

03:30.014 --> 03:32.181
You said, "Don't hold back."

03:32.182 --> 03:33.716
- Should I get the hose?
- What's goin' on?

03:33.717 --> 03:35.585
We did what you said,
the blindfold thing,

03:35.586 --> 03:37.754
- then he went nuts on me.
- He said, "Don't hold back."

03:37.756 --> 03:39.522
Then why do we even learn
to fight like this, man?

03:39.524 --> 03:41.424
Hey, it's idiotic.
We have eyes.

03:41.425 --> 03:43.427
In battle, anything
can be taken from you.

03:43.461 --> 03:48.164
Your hands...

03:48.199 --> 03:51.335
your feet...

03:51.368 --> 03:53.737
and your eyes.

03:53.771 --> 03:56.340
No matter what is taken, you
must be able to keep fighting.

03:56.373 --> 03:59.075
And win.

03:59.110 --> 04:00.311
All right, get changed.

04:00.312 --> 04:02.478
Attack scenarios in the
tech room in five minutes.

04:02.479 --> 04:04.479
Then breakfast.

04:06.217 --> 04:08.452
Yo, look, it's been
three months, man.

04:08.453 --> 04:10.019
When do I get to go back
to Gotham City?

04:10.020 --> 04:12.555
Bruce doesn't think you're
ready yet, and neither do I.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.225
- I'm sorry, man. You blew your privileges.
- What?

04:14.227 --> 04:16.999
The Batmobile joyrides, the
motorcycle on the staircase...

04:17.000 --> 04:18.527
I was practicing
my tactical maneuvers.

04:18.528 --> 04:20.164
And those websites
you bookmarked?

04:20.165 --> 04:22.365
You know that's not what the
Batcomputer is used for.

04:22.399 --> 04:24.234
Oh, come on, man.
This gig is a waste of time!

04:24.235 --> 04:25.902
It's called training.

04:25.903 --> 04:27.703
And you know as well as I do,
it never stops.

04:27.704 --> 04:31.175
- But all we do is fight each other.
- Yeah, like equals.

04:31.209 --> 04:33.019
When you're fighting with
Batman, you're a sidekick.

04:33.043 --> 04:35.189
- There are no sidekicks in Titans.
- You're kidding, right?

04:35.213 --> 04:38.317
Because that's literally all
the Titans are, are sidekicks.

04:38.350 --> 04:41.052
I mean, it's practically the fucking motto.
Wonder Girl, Aqualad...

04:41.086 --> 04:43.654
You're thinking of the old Titans.
This is the new Titans.

04:43.687 --> 04:45.254
That was the whole point
when Donna and I

04:45.255 --> 04:46.689
put the team together
the first time.

04:46.690 --> 04:48.424
We're partners.
We have each other's backs.

04:48.425 --> 04:50.694
Yeah, well,
tell that to Tiger Boy.

04:52.831 --> 04:54.632
Okay, look,
here's the thing.

04:54.665 --> 04:56.935
I could actually use some
help with the others.

04:56.968 --> 04:59.637
They don't have
the experience you have.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.906
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

05:01.939 --> 05:03.817
Have you noticed how they
sort of look up to you?

05:03.841 --> 05:07.110
Follow your lead? When you're
on point, they're on point.

05:07.144 --> 05:09.413
- When you're not?
- It's true.

05:09.447 --> 05:10.915
They need
your leadership, Jason.

05:10.949 --> 05:15.949
You need to set the tone. I'm
not Robin anymore. You are.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.122
Hey, wait.

05:18.154 --> 05:21.425
If I'm Robin...

05:21.459 --> 05:25.295
who are you?

05:25.329 --> 05:28.778
That's a good question.

05:46.651 --> 05:48.451
Security breach
in cell block two.

05:48.485 --> 05:50.120
Security breach
in cell block two.

05:50.154 --> 05:52.065
- Do you copy?
<i>- All security personnel,</i>

05:52.089 --> 05:54.826
<i>report to cell block two.
This is not a drill.</i>

05:54.858 --> 05:56.827
<i>Repeat.
This is not a drill.</i>

05:56.860 --> 05:58.971
We have a security
breach in cell block two.

05:58.995 --> 06:02.298
Is anybody there?

06:47.745 --> 06:52.382
Good. I
thought the fun was over.

06:52.415 --> 06:54.016
Please.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.290
Don't. Please.

06:59.322 --> 07:03.961
No!

07:11.435 --> 07:13.937
Whoa, whoa.

07:13.971 --> 07:15.507
All right. This is all right.

07:15.540 --> 07:19.211
- First thing, you stay calm.
- What am I supposed to do, like...

07:19.244 --> 07:24.580
Just pet her. Slow, firm strokes.
There you go.

07:24.581 --> 07:27.384
Good. Now you can
get her attention.

07:27.418 --> 07:30.420
Grab the reins
and turn her head.

07:30.454 --> 07:31.622
Look at you, cowboy.

07:31.656 --> 07:35.660
- Thanks, Hank.
- That's all you, Ellis.

07:35.692 --> 07:37.113
Yee-haw!

07:40.697 --> 07:43.300
You look really good out there.

07:43.334 --> 07:45.403
Mmm. You smell like a horse.

07:45.435 --> 07:47.337
Quiet.
The horses can hear you.

07:48.740 --> 07:50.273
Sure beats Georgetown.

07:50.274 --> 07:52.843
I was actually a little worried
you'd be bored out here.

07:52.877 --> 07:54.710
You're all the excitement
I need.

07:58.382 --> 07:59.716
I spoke to Dick today.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.153
- How is hero academy going?
- Pretty good, I guess.

08:03.187 --> 08:04.889
He wants us to come visit.

08:04.923 --> 08:08.324
- See the Tower and the city.
- We should.

08:08.358 --> 08:10.095
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

08:10.127 --> 08:12.863
Isn't San Francisco
like a 24-hour party?

08:12.896 --> 08:14.399
You wanna put yourself
through that?

08:14.432 --> 08:17.536
You know the first thing
they teach you in recovery?

08:17.569 --> 08:20.838
The world's not gonna change just
because you decided to get clean.

08:20.872 --> 08:22.406
It's not just that.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.701
I don't think a room full of
masks is what we need right now.

08:29.213 --> 08:33.451
Hey, Ellis's dad brought over,
like, 40 pounds of rib eye.

08:33.484 --> 08:35.885
Fresh cut.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.355
- Yeah?
- How's steak sound tonight?

08:39.389 --> 08:41.926
I don't know.
Are you cooking?

08:41.960 --> 08:43.995
- Yeah, I'm cooking.
- Mmm.

08:44.028 --> 08:46.263
Who else is gonna cook
around here? You?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.635
I'm good, Dawn.

08:51.668 --> 08:54.572
You don't have to
worry about me.

08:54.605 --> 08:55.654
I know.

09:20.164 --> 09:24.369
- Did you get any jellies?
- No one likes jellies.

09:24.402 --> 09:27.138
Maybe no one on Tamaran,
but humans love jellies.

09:27.172 --> 09:28.739
That's kind of
why we invented them.

09:28.773 --> 09:30.942
Oh, so now you're human.
Got it.

09:30.975 --> 09:34.410
I'm half human. And that
half really likes jellies.

09:34.445 --> 09:36.080
Did I miss anything?

09:36.114 --> 09:40.283
No sign of Shimmer. I don't know.
Maybe she's not gonna show.

09:40.317 --> 09:42.353
She'll show.

09:42.354 --> 09:45.524
I don't know. I'm starting to think
that Roy Harper's intel was wrong.

09:45.557 --> 09:49.193
Well, you're the one that said
Shimmer will do anything for money.

09:49.226 --> 09:51.095
- If that includes murder...
- It does.

09:51.129 --> 09:54.431
Then this is the place
those deals get done.

09:54.465 --> 09:56.533
So, it might
take a few weeks.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.401
Don't you ever get tired?

09:58.402 --> 09:59.402
Or impatient?

09:59.403 --> 10:01.306
- Or pissed off?
- Where I come from,

10:01.339 --> 10:04.241
- it doesn't really pay to get pissed off.
- So you like it better here?

10:04.275 --> 10:07.177
In this van? No. I do not like
it better here in this van.

10:07.211 --> 10:08.711
On Earth.

10:10.950 --> 10:14.918
It's nice to be in a place where people
are still figuring themselves out.

10:14.952 --> 10:17.554
So, Earth is kind of
like one big middle school?

10:17.587 --> 10:19.957
In a way. You're young,

10:19.990 --> 10:22.460
you're just starting out.

10:22.493 --> 10:24.595
But you're born with options.

10:24.629 --> 10:26.130
Right? You live with options.

10:26.163 --> 10:28.466
Sounds like you're thinking
of staying more permanently.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.703
I was thinking, after we wrapped,
I might head to Florida.

10:32.738 --> 10:36.006
I hear there's places where it
actually gets above 50 degrees.

10:36.039 --> 10:40.610
Hey, speaking of options, have
you heard anything from Dick?

10:40.644 --> 10:43.280
No. Have you?

10:43.315 --> 10:46.049
Nope. I keep thinking
he's gonna call

10:46.083 --> 10:50.154
and beg me to help with the
kids, but so far, nothin'.

10:50.187 --> 10:53.423
- You good with that?
- I'm great with that.

10:53.456 --> 10:55.157
I did my time in the Tower.

11:09.474 --> 11:11.609
- Welcome, sir.
- Keep it close.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.892
Yes, sir.

11:25.089 --> 11:28.558
"In all fighting,
the direct method

11:28.591 --> 11:30.360
may be used...

11:30.394 --> 11:32.197
but...

11:32.230 --> 11:35.399
indirect methods
will be needed

11:35.432 --> 11:39.470
in order to secure victory.

11:39.503 --> 11:42.052
As..."

12:22.479 --> 12:23.589
Come in.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.817
Thought you might
be hungry.

12:27.851 --> 12:30.320
Thanks.

12:30.354 --> 12:34.692
"The onset..."

12:34.725 --> 12:36.894
Gar.

12:36.927 --> 12:39.596
Did you want to come in?

12:39.629 --> 12:40.629
Sure.

12:45.769 --> 12:48.004
- You make this?
- Dick did.

12:48.038 --> 12:50.875
The crust is made
out of cauliflower.

12:50.908 --> 12:52.277
Why would somebody do that?

12:52.309 --> 12:55.212
If we hate eating, then we
have more time to train.

12:55.245 --> 12:57.548
Okay, so it's just not me.
He's totally obsessed, right?

12:57.581 --> 13:01.485
He's turning into Mr. Miyagi
before our very eyes.

13:01.518 --> 13:02.686
Good one.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.291
Have you noticed
the other thing?

13:06.292 --> 13:07.292
What other thing?

13:07.293 --> 13:09.192
He's always trying to be
extra nice to me.

13:10.327 --> 13:14.431
- Yeah.
- I guess he's trying to make up for...

13:14.465 --> 13:15.731
- Killing you.
- Yeah.

13:15.732 --> 13:16.700
Hmm.

13:16.701 --> 13:20.801
- Is it working?
- Not really.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.408
This feels good. I...

13:25.409 --> 13:26.810
We haven't talked like this
in a while.

13:26.811 --> 13:30.048
Yeah. Well, my fault.

13:30.081 --> 13:33.951
- It's all good.
- No, it's not.

13:33.985 --> 13:36.086
I feel different.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.923
Like I'm not the same person
I used to be.

13:39.956 --> 13:42.125
None of us are.

13:42.159 --> 13:43.692
Have you talked to Dick
about it?

13:43.693 --> 13:44.695
God, no.

13:44.729 --> 13:46.398
- You probably should.
- I can't.

13:46.431 --> 13:50.668
It's so important to him that
we stay strong, you know?

13:50.701 --> 13:54.038
Especially me.
I'm his A student.

13:54.072 --> 13:56.474
I can't let him down
like that.

13:56.508 --> 14:01.508
Are you worried that he's
gonna think you're a failure?

14:02.246 --> 14:04.846
I'm worried he's gonna
think he's a failure.

14:07.951 --> 14:11.960
- God, I miss Kory.
- Me, too.

14:11.961 --> 14:13.323
Road trip?

14:13.357 --> 14:16.159
I think that would be
highly unrecommended.

14:17.326 --> 14:19.126
What's that?

14:25.971 --> 14:30.971
<i>Pull the
vehicle to the side of the road.</i>

15:01.873 --> 15:04.418
...live at a
downtown car chase <i>in a stolen vehicle.</i>

15:04.442 --> 15:09.442
<i>Police seem to have
the suspect cornered.</i>

15:10.148 --> 15:11.447
Freeze!

15:13.049 --> 15:15.552
Freeze! Ahh!

15:21.357 --> 15:22.398
<i>Now it looks
like the suspect...</i>

15:22.399 --> 15:23.759
Who the hell is that?

15:23.760 --> 15:26.041
A total badass.

15:34.605 --> 15:36.683
<i>The suspect
does appear to be female,</i>

15:36.707 --> 15:40.311
<i>she's got silver hair. She does seem to
be injured, we're not sure how badly...</i>

15:40.345 --> 15:42.279
Get down
on the ground!

15:42.312 --> 15:45.649
Freeze!

15:45.683 --> 15:49.683
<i>Watch for it...
Not sure where she thinks she's...</i>

15:52.222 --> 15:54.924
So this all fits the legal
definition of collusion.

15:58.095 --> 15:59.662
<i>Oh, my.
Okay. Did you see that?</i>

15:59.663 --> 16:00.797
<i>I absolutely did...</i>

16:00.798 --> 16:02.399
I'll be back.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
<i>...suspect actually jumped
from the roof of the parking garage.</i>

16:04.402 --> 16:06.331
<i>Now, that's seven stories...</i>

16:33.464 --> 16:36.000
You were really good out there
with Ellis today.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.600
He's really getting the hang
of those horses.

16:38.602 --> 16:41.871
You know, he's been clean
almost five weeks.

16:41.905 --> 16:45.109
No relapses.

16:45.143 --> 16:46.977
You don't seem happy.

16:47.010 --> 16:50.280
His friends...

16:50.315 --> 16:52.149
if that's what
we're gonna call 'em,

16:52.182 --> 16:55.452
are startin' to slither out
of the woodwork.

16:55.486 --> 16:57.655
Trying to get him
to party with them again.

16:57.688 --> 17:00.091
Should he stay here
for a few days?

17:00.124 --> 17:01.458
No.

17:01.493 --> 17:06.130
He's gonna have to learn to
deal with it on his own.

17:06.163 --> 17:09.564
We can't do it for him.

17:13.037 --> 17:15.673
You know how proud
I am of you?

17:15.707 --> 17:18.343
And what you're doing
to change his life?

17:18.375 --> 17:21.011
You're a hero to him.
You know that, right?

17:21.045 --> 17:24.414
He's the one
doing all the work.

17:24.449 --> 17:26.915
- I'm just coaching him from the sidelines.
- No.

17:26.951 --> 17:29.153
I think this might be
your thing.

17:29.186 --> 17:33.458
I think helping kids
might be your best skill.

17:33.490 --> 17:36.026
- I got other skills.
- You do?

17:36.027 --> 17:37.626
- Greater skills.
- No.

17:37.627 --> 17:38.627
Yeah.

17:39.963 --> 17:43.064
- Really?
- Watch this.

18:55.105 --> 18:57.205
What the hell?

19:12.021 --> 19:15.922
Yo, go check the fuse box.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.825
What the fuck was that?

20:18.623 --> 20:21.025
Please, don't kill me.

20:21.057 --> 20:23.595
Where's your phone?

20:23.627 --> 20:25.997
<i>This is 911.
What's your emergency?</i>

20:26.030 --> 20:33.202
Um... There's a meth lab
at 2751 Hollister Lane.

20:33.203 --> 20:36.973
It's being run by...

20:37.007 --> 20:40.344
Three complete dipshits...

20:40.377 --> 20:43.882
Three complete dipshits, so...

20:43.914 --> 20:48.752
You better have someone come down and
arrest us. Thank you for your time.

20:48.787 --> 20:53.586
Your mother would be
very proud.

21:16.146 --> 21:17.497
How long?

21:25.021 --> 21:26.221
A month.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.884
Where were you?

21:52.916 --> 21:57.288
There's a meth lab where
Ellis' friends used to cook.

21:57.320 --> 22:01.125
Used to?

22:01.157 --> 22:04.394
Not after tonight.

22:04.428 --> 22:06.830
God damn it, Dawn.

22:06.865 --> 22:09.767
- You could've been killed.
- I'm always careful, you know that.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.703
Goin' out by yourself
like that?

22:12.737 --> 22:15.138
I know what I'm doing.

22:15.172 --> 22:19.376
We had an agreement.

22:19.410 --> 22:22.246
We have no future
with Hawk and Dove.

22:22.278 --> 22:26.218
No marriage, no kids, no life.

22:26.250 --> 22:31.250
We got lucky for a while, and then
that luck stopped, so we stopped.

22:33.457 --> 22:37.057
It's just too dangerous.

22:41.665 --> 22:46.036
Too dangerous for you.

22:46.069 --> 22:47.739
What?

22:47.771 --> 22:52.771
We became Hawk and Dove to
deal with pain. Our pain.

22:53.210 --> 22:55.980
And it worked.

22:56.013 --> 22:59.349
But then, it wasn't enough for
you, and you found other ways.

22:59.383 --> 23:01.885
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

23:01.920 --> 23:05.221
That's why I went alone, so that
you wouldn't risk a relapse.

23:05.256 --> 23:06.857
Oh, I see.

23:06.891 --> 23:10.761
So, you were doing me a favor sneaking
out behind my back like that.

23:10.795 --> 23:14.833
- Maybe I was.
- Bullshit, Dawn!

23:14.865 --> 23:17.434
You were in a coma for a month.

23:17.468 --> 23:20.203
You got to sleep through it,
but I didn't.

23:20.204 --> 23:25.204
I had to sit by your side, wondering if
you were gonna die, every fucking day.

23:27.045 --> 23:32.045
Being Hawk and Dove
was dangerous for both of us.

23:32.415 --> 23:34.685
I stopped,

23:34.719 --> 23:39.356
but if you can't...

23:39.390 --> 23:43.259
we're done.

23:51.769 --> 23:55.405
- Ellis?
- Hey, you okay?

23:55.439 --> 23:59.788
What's wrong with him?

24:01.378 --> 24:02.814
- Oh, my God!
- No. No, no!

24:02.846 --> 24:07.846
- We gotta go.
- Ellis! No! We have to help him!

24:42.753 --> 24:44.521
- Hank?
<i>- We got trouble.</i>

24:44.555 --> 24:47.025
Dawn and I just got a visit
from Dr. Light.

24:47.057 --> 24:49.727
- <i>Are you okay?
- We are.</i>

24:49.760 --> 24:52.328
There was a kid
we were helping...

24:52.363 --> 24:53.530
He wasn't so lucky.

24:53.564 --> 24:55.065
You sure
it was Dr. Light?

24:55.066 --> 24:56.700
Just saw a kid burn up
from the inside out.

24:56.701 --> 24:57.935
I'm pretty sure
it was him.

24:57.969 --> 25:01.438
All right, I'm sorry.
It's just...

25:01.439 --> 25:02.806
I thought
he was still in prison.

25:02.807 --> 25:05.174
<i>I guess
he paroled himself.</i>

25:05.209 --> 25:06.377
This is bad.

25:06.411 --> 25:08.746
- No shit.
<i>- You guys should come here.</i>

25:08.779 --> 25:11.380
We should get together
to figure this out.

25:16.453 --> 25:19.653
<i>Okay. We're on our way.</i>

25:36.347 --> 25:38.509
<i>Access denied.</i>

25:38.541 --> 25:42.291
Going somewhere?

25:49.319 --> 25:51.519
We need to talk.

25:53.624 --> 25:55.826
You can't keep me here
against my will.

25:55.859 --> 25:58.195
- It's kidnapping.
- Call it a precaution.

25:58.229 --> 26:00.797
I saw what you could do
out there on the street,

26:00.798 --> 26:02.333
and it looked like
you might need some help.

26:02.334 --> 26:05.536
- Better safe than sorry.
- So you brought me here unconscious?

26:05.568 --> 26:07.237
You can leave
whenever you want.

26:07.270 --> 26:08.538
Great.

26:08.571 --> 26:10.907
They're still out there.

26:10.942 --> 26:13.877
And if I could find you,
so can they.

26:13.911 --> 26:18.816
It's pretty clear
you're running from someone.

26:18.849 --> 26:21.317
Do you wanna tell me who?

26:21.352 --> 26:23.788
- No.
- Okay.

26:23.820 --> 26:26.557
Let's start with who you are.

26:26.590 --> 26:29.693
- You got a name?
- Like you haven't gone through my stuff.

26:29.727 --> 26:31.228
I haven't.

26:31.229 --> 26:33.998
Look, there are a lot of ways
I could find out who you are.

26:34.031 --> 26:36.533
But I'd rather
you just tell me.

26:36.534 --> 26:38.000
The less you people know,
the better.

26:38.001 --> 26:39.835
You don't need to
worry about us.

26:39.836 --> 26:41.037
We can take care
of ourselves.

26:41.038 --> 26:43.640
Yeah, what the hell
is this place anyway?

26:43.641 --> 26:45.075
This is a place
where people like you

26:45.076 --> 26:47.378
can learn how to be the best
version of who you are.

26:47.412 --> 26:51.715
And you can do it without
being afraid for your life.

26:54.417 --> 26:57.018
Boy, are you deluded.

26:58.556 --> 27:01.159
Bringing me here
was a big mistake.

27:01.192 --> 27:02.960
He'll kill you
and everyone else

27:02.961 --> 27:05.194
in this place
just to get to me.

27:05.229 --> 27:07.665
Who? Who is he?

27:07.699 --> 27:12.699
The more you know, the more
trouble it makes for all of us.

27:13.237 --> 27:15.105
Now...

27:15.140 --> 27:19.375
are you gonna
let me outta here?

27:31.323 --> 27:34.092
You know, they did write
music after 1979.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.993
They didn't just crank out "We
Are Family" and call it quits.

27:36.994 --> 27:39.163
Mmm. They should have.

27:39.196 --> 27:40.765
Can we please
dip a toe into the '80s?

27:40.798 --> 27:45.798
Just five minutes of Madonna,
that's all I need.

27:48.471 --> 27:49.773
Hm.

27:49.807 --> 27:52.109
That's it.
Tonight's a bust.

27:52.143 --> 27:56.097
She ain't showin'.
Let's get tacos.

28:02.186 --> 28:04.455
So what do you think
is going on out there?

28:04.489 --> 28:07.791
He's probably just trying
to find out who she is.

28:07.825 --> 28:09.193
He's giving her a sell job.

28:09.227 --> 28:11.395
That's what he does, 'cause
he can't resist a stray.

28:11.429 --> 28:15.097
I mean, I knew he'd be bringing
in new people. I just...

28:15.098 --> 28:16.700
I guess I didn't think
it'd be so soon.

28:16.701 --> 28:18.802
We don't even know
if we can trust her.

28:18.803 --> 28:20.403
Hell, we don't even know
what the fuck she is.

28:20.404 --> 28:23.406
What she is,
is a person who needs help.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.244
Or is she a person?

28:27.278 --> 28:29.213
How did she
survive the jump?

28:29.247 --> 28:30.580
So, you think
she's a metahuman?

28:30.614 --> 28:33.250
Yeah, or an alien, like Kory.

28:33.284 --> 28:36.054
Well, if she was like Kory, those
cops wouldn't be alive right now.

28:36.086 --> 28:38.355
She can fight, all right.
I'll give her that.

28:38.390 --> 28:39.957
Whoever she is,
she's had training.

28:39.990 --> 28:41.826
Did you guys see her eye?

28:41.858 --> 28:43.260
When Dick was changing
the bandage?

28:43.294 --> 28:46.029
- What about it?
- It was gone.

28:46.064 --> 28:48.965
- But the wound had already healed.
- Are you serious?

28:50.669 --> 28:53.938
She's been here one hour, and you
guys are already obsessed with her.

28:53.971 --> 28:55.406
She's a freak.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.741
- Look, my vote is we kick her ass out.
- Okay, wait.

28:57.775 --> 28:59.076
Who says we even get a vote?

28:59.109 --> 29:01.112
Who says she even
wants to stay?

29:01.144 --> 29:02.747
Look, it's hard to believe,

29:02.748 --> 29:05.748
but maybe her idea of paradise isn't
sharing a bathroom with you, Jason.

29:08.385 --> 29:12.046
I know how we can find
out exactly who she is.

29:20.030 --> 29:22.330
Is she gone?

29:23.034 --> 29:25.668
She's in her room.

29:25.669 --> 29:27.571
Sounds like
she's staying.

29:27.605 --> 29:30.775
Maybe not. She's pretty
intent on leaving.

29:30.807 --> 29:35.779
Do we get a vote?

29:35.813 --> 29:37.847
Look, I know
it seems uncomfortable,

29:37.882 --> 29:41.118
the idea of a stranger
joining our...

29:41.152 --> 29:43.819
family. But you guys
have to trust that I know...

29:43.820 --> 29:46.222
I think it's a great idea.

29:46.256 --> 29:47.959
Really?

29:47.991 --> 29:49.461
It's what you do.

29:49.493 --> 29:52.396
Face it, Dick, you can't resist
a bird with a broken wing.

29:52.430 --> 29:55.599
- I wouldn't say I can't.
- Come on. You helped me. You helped Gar.

29:55.634 --> 29:58.802
- I didn't help Jason.
- Can anyone help Jason?

30:00.705 --> 30:04.107
This is the reason you
restarted Titans, isn't it?

30:04.142 --> 30:09.712
So people like us and her,
whoever she is, can have a home.

30:09.713 --> 30:12.282
- This is different, Rachel.
- How?

30:12.317 --> 30:13.950
When you came to me,
you wanted help.

30:13.951 --> 30:15.385
She doesn't.

30:15.419 --> 30:17.188
Hmm.

30:17.221 --> 30:20.124
Maybe she doesn't know it.

30:20.157 --> 30:21.893
Or can't admit it.

30:21.925 --> 30:24.929
It's pretty obvious
she needs help.

30:24.961 --> 30:29.267
That's what you do best.
You're good at it.

30:29.299 --> 30:31.435
I'm not sure
if it's the right thing to do.

30:31.469 --> 30:36.269
I don't think
you have a choice.

30:50.555 --> 30:53.723
So, what is the deal
with you and Shimmer, anyway?

30:53.758 --> 30:54.758
- "The deal"?
- Yeah.

30:54.759 --> 30:56.461
Why are you so desperate
to take her down?

30:56.493 --> 31:01.493
Hmm. Well, first, her name is Shimmer.
That's just annoying.

31:01.633 --> 31:06.633
Well, it is your lucky day.
Look who just showed.

31:10.141 --> 31:12.843
- She actually shimmers.
- Yeah.

31:12.876 --> 31:14.144
Huh.

31:14.178 --> 31:17.178
Selinda Flinders, we're
taking you into custody.

31:19.150 --> 31:21.684
Don't make this
harder than it has to be.

31:21.719 --> 31:25.769
But that's what I do, love.

31:28.960 --> 31:33.160
- I'll go high.
- I'll go low.

31:48.878 --> 31:50.981
Really?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.414
Couldn't resist.

32:09.732 --> 32:10.934
Bruce Wayne.

32:10.968 --> 32:13.171
How did I know
you'd be awake?

32:13.203 --> 32:15.071
Is everything all right?

32:15.105 --> 32:17.708
<i>Got kind of
a weird situation.</i>

32:17.740 --> 32:18.876
Found this young woman,

32:18.910 --> 32:21.945
and she's in trouble.
Someone's trying to kill her.

32:21.979 --> 32:24.015
<i>But she's special, Bruce.</i>

32:24.048 --> 32:27.417
<i>You and me kind of special.</i>

32:27.451 --> 32:29.386
I think
she can heal herself.

32:29.420 --> 32:32.789
- Where is she now?
<i>- Here, in the Tower.</i>

32:32.823 --> 32:34.724
She doesn't wanna stay.

32:34.758 --> 32:36.826
You didn't wanna stay either.

32:36.861 --> 32:40.596
Not at first.

32:40.631 --> 32:42.467
How long did it take?

32:42.500 --> 32:45.336
- A long time.
<i>- I don't have a long time.</i>

32:45.369 --> 32:48.205
- Do you know why I stayed?
<i>- I think so.</i>

32:48.239 --> 32:50.474
It's hard to be angry
in a vacuum.

32:50.508 --> 32:54.845
I provided a target
and a focus for your rage.

32:54.878 --> 32:58.215
I became a tangible enemy.

32:58.249 --> 33:00.684
I was mad at fate
and death.

33:00.719 --> 33:04.188
<i>But those are just concepts.
You're a person.</i>

33:04.221 --> 33:06.022
More or less.

33:06.057 --> 33:08.727
Well, she's a tougher case
than me.

33:08.759 --> 33:12.997
- She's scared. Really scared.
<i>- Do you know who she is?</i>

33:13.029 --> 33:15.165
She doesn't
want me to know.

33:15.199 --> 33:17.201
Well, there are
ways to find out.

33:17.234 --> 33:18.702
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

33:18.737 --> 33:20.872
And I haven't put nine trackers
in her, either.

33:20.905 --> 33:23.074
<i>I know that's your thing,
but it's not mine.</i>

33:23.106 --> 33:25.042
It's not about
"my thing" or "your thing."

33:25.076 --> 33:27.913
You can't make an informed
decision without information.

33:27.945 --> 33:30.648
<i>That's the point. I'm not
sure it is my decision.</i>

33:30.682 --> 33:33.851
<i>You adopted me when I was a kid.
She's an adult.</i>

33:33.884 --> 33:35.219
Still.

33:35.252 --> 33:37.655
You said she's scared
and in trouble.

33:37.689 --> 33:41.392
That's no frame of mind for anyone
to make life or death choices.

33:41.425 --> 33:44.762
We keep her there
till she can make them,

33:44.796 --> 33:49.066
and then make sure
they're the right ones.

33:49.099 --> 33:51.067
Okay, here's what
I have to know.

33:51.102 --> 33:54.137
Would you do it again?

33:54.172 --> 33:56.239
Take me in...

33:56.240 --> 34:00.840
devote all that time and trouble for
someone that just wants to leave?

34:04.080 --> 34:08.380
I would do everything
exactly the same.

34:23.201 --> 34:26.436
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna need the rope.

34:26.471 --> 34:30.041
No worries, love.
I'll be seeing you again.

34:30.074 --> 34:35.074
Doubt it. And seriously,
change the name.

34:39.114 --> 34:40.217
Hey, I gotta take this.

34:40.251 --> 34:41.751
Meet you at the taco truck?

34:41.784 --> 34:43.420
Yeah. What do you want?

34:43.454 --> 34:46.090
Surprise me.
Just not chicken.

34:46.123 --> 34:48.059
Or pork.

34:48.092 --> 34:52.092
- Or veggie.
- Beef tacos. You got it.

35:01.038 --> 35:05.038
Hello, Ms. Koriand'r.

35:11.114 --> 35:14.114
Surprised to see me?

35:16.454 --> 35:19.356
What are you doing here?

35:19.389 --> 35:21.492
I was expecting
more enthusiasm.

35:21.525 --> 35:23.960
After all, I came
a long way just for you.

35:23.994 --> 35:27.197
Who else did they send?

35:27.231 --> 35:30.034
Just me.

35:30.067 --> 35:32.235
They should have sent more.

35:35.505 --> 35:40.306
Sorry about that,
Your Highness.

35:43.213 --> 35:44.714
- Chicken burrito?
- That's me.

35:44.715 --> 35:47.918
Chicken taco.
There you go.

35:47.952 --> 35:51.054
Kory?

35:54.826 --> 35:58.302
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, it's Dawn. We have a problem.</i>

36:09.340 --> 36:10.774
Figured you'd be gone.

36:10.775 --> 36:12.040
You said
you were buying coffee.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.276
I like coffee.

36:14.277 --> 36:17.014
Good. We got
something in common.

36:27.592 --> 36:28.693
You're going
the wrong way.

36:28.726 --> 36:30.260
The BART station's
back there.

36:30.293 --> 36:32.295
We're not going
to Embarcadero.

36:32.329 --> 36:35.166
- We're going to Glen Park.
- Why?

36:35.199 --> 36:38.903
So I can drive around and see
if we're being followed.

36:38.936 --> 36:43.840
You didn't need to do this.
I'm fine on foot.

36:43.873 --> 36:45.143
- Right.
- I am.

36:45.177 --> 36:48.413
I couldn't let you just
walk out the front door.

36:48.445 --> 36:50.748
You sure you won't stay?

36:50.780 --> 36:52.782
I'm sure.

36:52.815 --> 36:53.917
Okay, look.

36:53.918 --> 36:55.285
Probably shouldn't have
just picked you up

36:55.286 --> 36:57.254
off the street
and taken you in.

36:57.255 --> 36:58.655
I overstepped.

36:58.688 --> 37:00.092
You think?

37:00.125 --> 37:03.760
What you do has to be
your own decision, obviously.

37:03.793 --> 37:06.597
But?

37:06.630 --> 37:09.333
Each of those kids has something
special, just like you.

37:09.367 --> 37:14.367
But they've learned that being
special and alone doesn't work.

37:15.706 --> 37:18.175
I'm teaching them
to have each other's back.

37:18.208 --> 37:21.278
I could teach you, too.

37:21.311 --> 37:26.311
That's it. I'm done.
Sales pitch over.

37:39.695 --> 37:41.030
Hang on.

37:41.065 --> 37:42.899
Here.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.901
What's that for?

37:43.902 --> 37:46.237
My number's in the contacts,
just in case.

37:46.269 --> 37:48.840
No.

37:48.873 --> 37:53.873
I know you don't think you need
it, but when you do, call me.

37:57.614 --> 38:01.751
Will you at least
give me your name?

38:01.784 --> 38:03.920
Rose.

38:03.954 --> 38:08.125
Nice to meet you, Rose.

38:08.159 --> 38:10.126
And, Rose?

38:10.161 --> 38:13.931
You can keep
the letter opener.

38:13.963 --> 38:15.014
Thanks.

38:19.036 --> 38:20.385
Get down!

38:35.052 --> 38:37.152
What was that?

38:44.195 --> 38:46.262
Come on.

38:46.297 --> 38:48.230
Come on.

38:48.231 --> 38:49.399
<i>Match identified.</i>

38:49.400 --> 38:51.969
"Rose Wilson."

38:52.003 --> 38:55.402
And that's her dad,
Slade Wilson.

38:58.342 --> 39:02.146
No fucking way.

39:02.179 --> 39:04.447
What?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.884
Deathstroke.
