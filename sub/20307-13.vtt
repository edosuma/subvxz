WEBVTT

00:08.174 --> 00:09.634
Put your end up, boss.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.639
Watch it!

00:14.723 --> 00:15.724
Sorry.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.771
All right, close it up, Jimmy.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.065
All aboard!

00:37.620 --> 00:40.749
(horn blows)

00:41.708 --> 00:42.792
LUCY: Fabian.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.047
Fabe.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.383
Hi, Luce.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.509
Hi.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.762
What time is it?

00:53.845 --> 00:55.930
A little after 6:00.
I'm on my way to work.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.933
Okay, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.562
Okay. I left you some breakfast.

01:02.645 --> 01:03.813
I'll call you later.

01:04.564 --> 01:05.648
Okay.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.275
Glad you're here.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.235
Okay.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.793
(traffic noises)

01:24.876 --> 01:26.294
(indistinct chatter)

01:26.377 --> 01:28.797
-Thank you.
-Oh, Captain. Graham Wells.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.882
-How do you do?
-Appreciate you taking the time.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.842
-It's all right.
-Would you like a menu, sir?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.929
Uh, no, thank you. Just black coffee
and whole-wheat toast.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.263
Right away.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.141
Hold my order till the captain's
is ready, will you, Evie?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.267
Yes, Mr. Wells.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.228
Pretty spartan fare, Captain.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.063
I'm not a big breakfast eater.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.147
Mm-hmm.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.484
(sighs) Well, uh,
should we wait to break bread

01:49.567 --> 01:51.236
or shall I go ahead and explain myself?

01:52.028 --> 01:52.904
I'm listening.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.533
A fortune teller friend said
you made an appearance

01:56.616 --> 01:59.160
-in his crystal ball the other night.
-Oh? What was I doing?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.663
Being offered Fletcher Daniels' job.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.456
(chuckles)

02:04.207 --> 02:06.918
Hope telling fortunes
isn't how your friend makes a living.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.920
(laughs) That's funny.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.799
No, no, no.
I think he has other sources of income,

02:12.882 --> 02:14.926
but indulge the hypothetical, Frank.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.636
Excuse the presumption.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.430
Some perspectives becoming chief of police

02:19.514 --> 02:21.432
would be an attractive prospect.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.768
Some perspectives
it would culminate a career.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.103
Hypothetically speaking.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.815
Uh-huh. That's why I wanted you to know
that there are people in this town,

02:28.898 --> 02:31.109
and you're sitting across
the table from one of them,

02:31.192 --> 02:33.945
that think if you take an offer like that
you're selling yourself short.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.449
They think the next desk you sit at ought
to have the seal of the city on its front,

02:39.033 --> 02:40.618
and they want to help you get there.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.788
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:45.957
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

02:46.040 --> 02:49.752
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:51.379
(theme music playing)

03:56.110 --> 03:58.112
(upbeat music playing)

04:58.756 --> 05:01.467
Item six, until notice,

05:01.551 --> 05:04.429
all EATer calls are referred to the Polk.

05:04.512 --> 05:08.016
Lieutenant Hunter and his men are
escorting the city marshals this morning.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.810
They're gonna serve a citation
to this Russian freighter

05:10.893 --> 05:13.229
that's been dumping
all that gunk in the harbor.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.189
You believe those creeps? Dumping sewage?

05:15.273 --> 05:19.736
Item seven,
Officer Hill's father passed yesterday.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.363
Bobby's gonna be off
for the next three days.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.616
Officer Renko's gonna team
with Officer Garfield

05:25.700 --> 05:27.493
until Bobby gets back.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.247
Eight, armed robbery and narcotics theft

05:31.331 --> 05:33.833
at Volker's Pharmacy last night.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.835
Now, the description's consistent

05:35.918 --> 05:38.963
with the J9 composite
that's posted upstairs

05:39.047 --> 05:41.674
of this guy been knocking
off all the drugstores.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.384
This perp's wrong, people,

05:43.468 --> 05:45.303
and he's been getting more active.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.514
A Jablonsky citation to the cop
that makes the collar.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.143
Item last, Detective Belker
has asked to address the shift.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.561
(indistinct talking)

05:53.644 --> 05:55.480
Get married, babe!

05:56.647 --> 05:58.733
-(laughing)
-MAN: Look who's here!

06:00.318 --> 06:02.862
Everyone who's been trying
to attend my wedding

06:02.945 --> 06:04.197
for the last several days...

06:04.280 --> 06:06.866
(laughter)

06:06.949 --> 06:08.159
-Everybody.
-Right!

06:11.746 --> 06:15.416
I wanted to apologize
for lousing up your schedules.

06:17.001 --> 06:21.547
Um, Robin and I are getting married
noon today at City Hall.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.592
-MAN: Sure.
-(laughter)

06:24.675 --> 06:27.095
And then we'll stop back here
after the ceremony

06:27.178 --> 06:28.304
on our way to Pearlman's,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.391
which is a lodge where we have
a honeymoon package at.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.686
Actually, we have two days left
on the package we bought.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.314
(indistinct chatter)

06:38.398 --> 06:40.358
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.781
Yeah, the detective's talking
like he committed a Brink's job.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.116
(laughter)

06:48.658 --> 06:50.868
Everybody knows that he was on a case.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.788
And I'm sure that everybody wishes

06:53.871 --> 06:57.375
the detective and the future Mrs. Belker
all the best.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.294
(applause)

07:02.046 --> 07:04.048
Okay, that's it! Let's go!

07:04.132 --> 07:05.550
They're getting away out there!

07:07.718 --> 07:09.512
We gotta get that refrigerator over here.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.222
I don't do no heavy lifting, babe.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.267
Mick, you got nothing
to apologize for, alright?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.144
It's been a very awkward situation.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.896
He's just trying to get rid
of his best man, that's all.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.606
Aw, that's not correct.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.318
Will you be talking to Bobby?

07:24.402 --> 07:26.904
Calling tonight. He's going home
with his daddy's remains.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.490
Oh, good. Um, could you convey
our sympathies?

07:29.574 --> 07:30.575
Right.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.243
Well...

07:34.328 --> 07:35.663
Excuse me.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.748
I'm gonna go home now and wait.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.083
-MAN: I'll be right out.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.043
(indistinct chattering)

07:41.586 --> 07:42.920
OFFICER: Hey, good luck.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.800
So he's a little nervous,
a little wound up.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.927
-LUCY: A little?
-He'll be okay.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.513
Well, today better be the charms.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.683
That boy's brain's floating toward
the thin ice of mental health.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.852
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Sid.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.103
Hey, what you got, Sidney?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.897
Sid, you know any cheap delivery people?

08:00.980 --> 08:02.315
Delivery of what commodity?

08:02.398 --> 08:05.401
Pick up a refrigerator at the Kubiak
and bring it over here.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.153
Legal delivery, I can't help you.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.237
On the other hand,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.865
you guys want to pop
that mad dog pharmacy killer?

08:10.948 --> 08:12.617
Hey, guy hasn't killed anybody, Sid.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.701
Oh. Oh, I see,

08:13.784 --> 08:16.287
and the department's just waiting
for that to occur?

08:16.370 --> 08:18.414
Whatever happened to first strike?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.332
Listen, guys.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.585
I got somebody with reliable access
to this creep.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.504
-Cooperative?
-Not exactly.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.173
But, uh, you could bust her for receiving.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.009
Make a deal. $200 buys my assistance.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.802
-Half a ball.
-$50?

08:31.886 --> 08:34.180
Hey, look, fellas,
this isn't like farming.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.558
I fink on a source,
they're lost to me forever.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.185
I think Leon's got a truck.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.395
Maybe he could bring the fridge
over here himself.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.481
I think we might be
on Leon's hate list, baby.

08:43.564 --> 08:47.193
(chuckles, applauds)
Kentucky freeze out. Very amusing.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.363
All right. $50. Let's do it.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.282
You know, I happen to like this lady,
but guess that doesn't count

08:53.366 --> 08:55.159
-for anything, either.
-Nope.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.537
-Morning.
-Captain.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.082
Couple of real softies.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.586
-Good morning, Captain.
-Stan.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.712
A lot of phone calls.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.214
I think, uh, Lieutenant Hunter

09:08.297 --> 09:10.466
might have stepped
in something down at the harbor.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.345
He's leaning against the door saying,

09:14.428 --> 09:16.764
"How you doin', Luce?" (laughs)

09:16.847 --> 09:19.225
Fabulous Fabe.
How long is he gonna be here?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.686
-We don't know yet.
-We don't know yet?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.980
I mean, when does he have
to be back at school?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.898
He thinks he might go to school up here.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.901
-Luce.
-They're getting away from us out there.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.820
-Luce, wait a minute.
-What?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.947
Didn't we go
through this jackpot last year?

09:33.030 --> 09:34.991
-What jackpot?
-Look, Fabian's not talking

09:35.074 --> 09:38.202
about moving in with his mother, right?
He knows she's back hooking again?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.413
-Right.
-So he's talking about moving in with you?

09:40.496 --> 09:41.539
Also right.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.043
Don't you think you've had
your quota lately, Luce?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.712
-Of what?
-Of getting hurt.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.798
When I saw that kid leaning up
against the doorway like that,

09:50.881 --> 09:52.300
that's the best feeling
I had in a long time.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.968
But what about what comes afterward?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.178
We're taking this one step
at a time, alright?

09:56.262 --> 09:59.807
The first step is he is here
and he thinks he wants to stay.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.642
Now, if he decides that is what he wants,

10:01.726 --> 10:03.811
I'll do everything
I can to make that happen.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.980
I know it might be a mess. You're right.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.524
But on the other hand, it might work out.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.485
When do I get to see him?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.324
He's coming up later today.
He's so big you're gonna die.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.241
You are crazy.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.243
You're an artist, Terry.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.495
It's like this gentleman's body

10:21.579 --> 10:24.165
is the cover of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>

10:24.248 --> 10:26.083
and you are Norman Rockwell.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.418
Don't move around.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.004
-Oh.
-That's gotta set.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.715
Save the sugar, Sid.

10:33.716 --> 10:34.925
How do you know these guys?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.595
I know the white guy from Harrisonville.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.847
The black guy is a friend
of the white guy.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.351
Terry, Johnny.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.774
Cold hands. I like that in a man.

10:49.857 --> 10:50.858
Pleasure's all mine.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.860
And, uh, that's Neal.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.529
He's, uh, catching 40 winks.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.406
Hi.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.620
So, who wants the tattoo?

11:02.703 --> 11:06.624
Well, actually, Johnny inherited
a TV camera that he, uh,

11:06.707 --> 11:09.502
-wants to dispose of.
-Good luck.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.962
I thought maybe you knew some people
in the industry.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.216
-Are you a cop?
-Me? Absolutely.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.884
So is he. Want to see our badges?

11:17.343 --> 11:21.055
Ter, doesn't that kid, uh, Jamie
make films or something?

11:21.138 --> 11:22.640
I don't know.
Why don't you call him and find out?

11:22.723 --> 11:25.893
Hey. Fine. You don't want the business?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.730
-How much do you want for it?
-$750.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.898
Four bills.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.110
Earth to Neal. Go get the camera.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.986
(grunts)

11:36.696 --> 11:37.988
Hey! Ooh!

11:38.072 --> 11:39.824
Salome won't hurt you.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.785
Feel her.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.078
She's cold...

11:44.161 --> 11:46.205
like your hand.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.541
Yeah, yeah. Oh, God! It's squeezing me!

11:48.624 --> 11:50.418
You should feel honored.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.880
She usually doesn't like strangers.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.550
Even a herpetophiles
such as I rarely elicit

11:57.633 --> 12:00.344
-such a positive response from a boa.
-Yeah.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.264
Got a bill of sale?

12:03.347 --> 12:04.849
I inherited, remember?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.058
Oh, yeah.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.478
Um, you, uh, inherit pretty regular?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.731
Couple of times a month.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.776
Well, uh, come back
next time you're in mourning.

12:15.860 --> 12:21.073
-Yeah. I'm sorry, honey. You're busted.
-Yeah, baby, you're arrested.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.743
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right--

12:23.826 --> 12:26.787
-Sid, you creep!
-You're cops? You guys are cops?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.122
Oh, save the crap.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.125
Come on, Terry. A guy's gotta eat.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.835
-Cuff her, Neal.
-Unh-unh.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.296
Here on this floor.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.839
Be careful. He's got an axe.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.507
BOBBY: (grunts) Harold!

12:38.591 --> 12:41.093
-That's enough, mister!
-Says who?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.970
-Says me. Now drop that pick.
-Oh, my lord.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.180
You know this guy?

12:45.389 --> 12:47.558
Bobby? Bobby!

12:47.641 --> 12:50.352
Why are you smashing in that lock?

12:50.436 --> 12:51.854
To get inside.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.401
-Do I recognize you?
-Not in your present condition you don't.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.362
The instruments in this locker are mine.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.864
Is your name Parsons?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.116
These instruments were stolen from me!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.160
Bobby, if you don't put down that axe,

13:06.243 --> 13:07.953
I'll have to take you in, buddy.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.663
You ain't taking me anywhere.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.166
All right. Watch his hands.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.798
Bobby, you're busted.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.801
Damn. You look familiar.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.476
Heard you had some excitement
at the harbor, Howard.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.311
We butted a few helmets.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.897
Hey, good for you, Lieutenant.
I heard you cussed them out.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.649
Lieutenant, the captain's looking for you.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.858
Howard.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.319
Oh, Frank, we couldn't serve the summons.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.780
We were bushwhacked
by some federal bureaucrats.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.698
Mm-hmm, I heard the story, Howard.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.244
I heard it from the chief's office,
from the mayor's office,

13:48.327 --> 13:49.453
and the state department.

13:49.537 --> 13:53.374
Ah, the Monday morning quarterbacks
have been checking in, are they, Frank?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.044
Your assignment
was to safeguard the marshals.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.713
Instead, you engage the ship's mate

13:59.797 --> 14:02.091
in a bullhorn shouting match.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.011
Then you search nonpublic
areas of the ship

14:06.095 --> 14:07.972
for nonexistent defectors

14:08.681 --> 14:12.726
and you make totally unfounded
accusations about spying

14:12.810 --> 14:16.105
accompanied by frisks
of two Soviet citizens.

14:16.188 --> 14:20.276
Frank, it is well-known, KGB are assigned

14:20.359 --> 14:21.986
to every so-called merchant vessel.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.489
What is well-known to the officials
who have called me

14:25.573 --> 14:29.410
is that your cowboy patriotism
could precipitate an incident.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.954
The chief's office wants
you to draft an apology.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.456
(chuckles) Judas H., Frank.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.500
And I happen to agree.
Within the hour, Howard.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.547
If you'll excuse me,
I'll consider my response.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.673
Your apology.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.593
Very well.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.387
Excuse me.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.602
You know what our Russian friends
would say about this, Frank?

14:54.685 --> 14:55.769
What's that?

14:56.312 --> 15:01.275
(speaking Russian)

15:02.651 --> 15:06.780
This eats large toilet bowl.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.783
Lieutenant.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.660
Miss Davenport.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.165
-Everything okay?
-Just Howard...

15:17.166 --> 15:19.168
trying to start World War III.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.883
Come with me
to the Monsignor Keller dinner tonight.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.468
I thought we turned that down.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.470
Well, Walt Callahan got the flu

15:29.553 --> 15:32.264
and they just called
and asked me to deliver the address.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.391
I'll get our duds from the cleaners.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.226
Dish the dirt, Furillo.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
What was breakfast
with Graham Wells about?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.608
He said Fletcher Daniels
may resign next month.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.736
Evidently he's been offered a consultancy
with the crime institute.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.238
What's that got to do
with political kingmaking?

15:48.322 --> 15:51.492
Wells said that if they offer
me Daniels' job, before accepting,

15:51.575 --> 15:55.871
I should keep in mind that he thinks
I'd be a viable candidate

15:55.955 --> 15:58.082
in the mayoral race.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.917
Furillo, you political hunk.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.628
Oh, I think he's in left field.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.589
I've never heard of Mr. Wells
playing that position.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.926
Was it Wells who, uh, invited you
to make the speech tonight?

16:09.009 --> 16:11.220
The Keller Committee
just called a few minutes ago.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.930
You don't think there's a connection?

16:14.556 --> 16:15.766
I hadn't thought about that.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.519
What's your speech
gonna be about, Furillo?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.771
-I haven't thought of that, either.
-Hmm.

16:20.854 --> 16:25.776
How about rising young Italians?

16:29.530 --> 16:32.491
Apologize. Apologize for what?

16:32.992 --> 16:36.453
For taking the kid gloves off
when it comes to dealing with a bear?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.122
You'll be pumping iron then, sir?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.541
Judas. If I can find my weights.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.713
Alright. Who moved them?
Where the hell are they?

16:45.796 --> 16:46.755
(chuckles)

16:46.839 --> 16:50.384
All non-departmental property was removed
from the equipment lockers, sir.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.095
To where and by whom?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.930
I believe the storage room, sir.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.974
Where the hell's the storage room?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.142
By the boiler room, sir.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.394
-Oh, Judas priest.
-Sergeant Jablonsky!

17:04.648 --> 17:06.483
Goddamn Russkies.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.986
That sickle and hammer.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.323
Please!

17:17.911 --> 17:19.038
Ah!

17:19.747 --> 17:21.498
Red menace.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.464
Conspiracy.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.260
Ah!

17:33.343 --> 17:34.428
(thud)

17:34.511 --> 17:36.930
(moans)

17:37.014 --> 17:39.683
I can't tolerate this.
I won't tolerate it.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.477
Man thinks he can run roughshod on me.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.187
Now, Mr. Parsons, I know you're upset.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.189
Bobby thinks
he don't have to answer to no one.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.357
But there's an area
I have to keep clear here, huh?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.568
Oh, there he is! There's the great man!

17:49.651 --> 17:52.196
-The a-number one horse's a--
-Why, you!

17:52.279 --> 17:54.782
-Hey, don't be kicking him.
-Man, you sold me out!

17:54.865 --> 17:57.618
Oh, preach on it, Bobby!
Blame everyone but your damn fool self!

17:57.701 --> 17:59.620
-Officer, you gonna book this man?
-Yes, I am.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.372
Would you please move out of my way, sir?
Mr. Angel is very busy right now.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.375
Busy? Busy stealing my possessions.
That was my cubicle he broke--

18:05.459 --> 18:07.878
I was trying to get my
damn instruments back!

18:07.961 --> 18:10.547
They ain't yours no more, Bobby.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.551
You ignored one too many court order
and one too many notice to pay.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.595
What the hell you wanna
do with that stuff, Ned?

18:16.678 --> 18:19.139
All you know is grinding money
out of people who play those things.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.100
-Is that so?
-Come on!

18:21.183 --> 18:25.229
I guess it wasn't me starving with you
those 11 years on the road, huh?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.272
Riding my back, you mean.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.526
And I guess it wasn't you that checked me
into that damn detox.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.694
Closer than I ever want to get to hell
and be alive!

18:32.778 --> 18:34.530
Which was to go there or to go to jail

18:34.613 --> 18:36.240
and you should've stayed there
until you was well!

18:36.323 --> 18:37.699
Listen to me now!

18:38.158 --> 18:40.119
Do you want to charge him
with attempted theft?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.412
We already got him
for destruction of property.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.581
Go ahead, Ned. Drive another nail in.

18:45.082 --> 18:48.877
-It ain't worth my time.
-So long, Ned.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.547
Go find yourself another picker
to sink your teeth into.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.715
Bobby, turn around here
now and talk to this lady.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.551
Empty your pockets. Put it on the counter.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.595
Well, I'll take my trousers off
if you ask real nice.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.930
-Hey, shut up!
-For crying out loud.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.057
Turn around here and face this counter.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.353
Hey, just a second. I recognize you.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.690
You're the son of a buck that got me
popped for possession last week

19:09.773 --> 19:11.358
and got me into this whole damn mess!

19:11.441 --> 19:15.279
Last week? It was six months ago, pal!
And your manager's right.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.865
You got yourself into this
all by your own lonesome.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.700
Six months?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.327
(chuckles)

19:23.203 --> 19:25.789
My, time sure flies
when you're having fun.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.083
-Put that thing down! Book him!
-Walk over there.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.003
Okay, let's take your picture, dude.
Come on.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.796
Lord, have mercy on me.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.049
(groans)

19:36.800 --> 19:38.927
(engine chugging, squeaking)

19:39.011 --> 19:40.179
Where am I?

19:40.637 --> 19:41.889
Ugh.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.600
Oh.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.816
Ugh.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.865
Damn.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.285
Of course.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.666
EATer Brigade.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.460
Code 5.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.922
Men?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.007
Are you down here?

20:31.688 --> 20:33.440
Any other captives?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.699
Or am I the only one
the Russkies have taken?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.244
You two probably won't believe

20:45.327 --> 20:48.288
that I was formerly
a university instructor.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.374
14 years.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.042
Where'd you use to teach?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.294
Various institutions.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.880
Now I'm driving a taxicab.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.715
Are you gonna take the Parkway?

20:58.799 --> 21:02.844
The Parkway is closed to southbounds
from 11:00 to 2:00, sir.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.180
Would you like to do the driving for me?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.474
-Would you like to do my job?
-MAN: Police officer!

21:07.557 --> 21:08.392
-(whistle blows)
-No.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.645
Alright. I'm trying to get to there.
I'm going as fast as I can.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.981
-What are you doing?
-I'm not going.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.565
You're grabbing my shoulder.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.775
(growling)

21:16.858 --> 21:19.361
You're grabbing my shoulder, sir,
and you're growling!

21:20.654 --> 21:22.614
-He's got him.
-He's got him. He's busted.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.492
-BOTH: He's got him.
-Sir, I am becoming very anxious.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.410
(growls)

21:26.493 --> 21:28.578
-Hey, hey, green! Go! Let's go!
-(horns honking)

21:28.662 --> 21:31.415
-Let's go. Go, go, go.
-I will! I will! I'm driving!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.752
With this ring I thee wed.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.839
And with all my worldly goods,

21:39.589 --> 21:40.841
I thee endow.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.011
I now pronounce you man and wife.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.595
Finally.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.973
You may kiss the bride.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.980
Didn't think we'd bring this one
home after three days.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.857
My warmest congratulations to you both.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.233
Thank you.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.443
Thank you, sir.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.194
My bill.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.700
I know it's high,
but I had a lot of downtime on this one.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.868
(chuckles)

22:13.123 --> 22:15.292
Taking an American prisoner.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.587
An American citizen, prisoner.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.088
Oh.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.008
Beat him about the head...

22:25.510 --> 22:27.846
throwing him... ow...

22:28.472 --> 22:31.850
into this dungeon of a boiler room.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.977
(sighs)

22:34.061 --> 22:36.688
If you think
Howard Hunter goes peacefully,

22:36.772 --> 22:40.692
you comrades of the SS Gulag, think again.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.196
(coughs)

22:48.450 --> 22:51.620
You have invited an asp to your breast.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.206
You have swallowed a piranha.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.750
(pipes squeak)

22:56.833 --> 22:59.127
Yes. (laughs)

22:59.211 --> 23:00.462
If this...

23:01.671 --> 23:03.882
Rust bucket sinks...

23:05.717 --> 23:07.511
I'm Eleanor Roosevelt.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.637
(chuckles)

23:16.144 --> 23:18.855
Detective,
I'm representing Terry Sylvestri.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.399
Yeah, who'd the snake hire?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.483
I don't understand.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.193
Private joke, Miss Davenport.

23:23.276 --> 23:26.822
Ms. Sylvestri informs me you suggested
on the way to the station house,

23:26.905 --> 23:29.783
her cooperation in another matter
might get charges dropped.

23:29.866 --> 23:30.909
Worth a conversation.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.702
We could have another one on entrapment.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.746
I'll get an interrogation room.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.666
-Is anybody else hot?
-Here they come. Here.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.836
-MAN: Get ready. Here they come.
-Do you believe that creep Leon?

23:40.919 --> 23:43.463
Double sawbuck
and he's late with Belker's refrigerator.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.967
Hey, congratulations!

23:47.050 --> 23:49.177
(cheering and laughter)

23:56.852 --> 24:00.564
I may not have been there,
but I'm still the best man, huh?

24:00.647 --> 24:01.565
Aw.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.442
Aha.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.361
Aha, congratulations, Mick!

24:06.445 --> 24:07.571
Thank you, Stan!

24:08.613 --> 24:11.700
-Did you come by dog sled, Leon?
-Registration lapsed. I got pulled over.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.785
Come on, give it to me.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.245
Uh, excuse me.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.790
Uh, excuse me. Everybody listen up.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.586
Mick, Robin, as head
of the group-gift committee,

24:22.669 --> 24:25.005
it gives me great pleasure to present you

24:25.088 --> 24:28.091
this 21-cubic-foot,
frost-free refrigerator

24:28.175 --> 24:30.802
from your friends and fellow officers
at Hill Street Station.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.180
-(cheering)
-Thank you!

24:34.014 --> 24:35.223
That's so sweet, J.D.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.517
Now, that's what I volunteered for.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.269
This is great!

24:39.352 --> 24:42.189
-Is it me, or is anybody else hot?
-No, it's hot.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.984
Spy ship without a radio transmitter.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.779
(door opens)

24:52.699 --> 24:55.577
Lieutenant? Sir?

24:55.660 --> 24:56.828
You down here?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.705
Ballantine?

25:01.416 --> 25:02.959
Ballantine, are you all right?

25:03.043 --> 25:04.377
We were looking for you, sir.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.714
Who's "we," Ballantine?

25:07.797 --> 25:10.300
Or just myself, I guess, sir.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.094
You're at large on an enemy vessel?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.138
Your liberty granted to you?

25:15.639 --> 25:16.473
Sir?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.727
Ballantine, I can only conclude
they have brainwashed and turned you.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.729
No, sir, I came down looking for you.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.397
You owe me no apology, Ballantine.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.316
Torture is a terrible thing.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.152
Was it the tiger cages?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.864
Nobody's tortured me, sir,
honest to goodness.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.574
I say, there's no shame, Ballantine.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.161
The only shame is not admitting the truth.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.249
Sir, the truth is I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.254
(chuckles)

25:48.088 --> 25:49.881
Very well, Ballantine.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.928
Oh, look, the Miss America contestant.

25:55.011 --> 25:55.887
Oh!

26:00.433 --> 26:03.270
Sorry, old sport. We'll deprogram you
when you come to your senses.

26:03.353 --> 26:06.273
(pipes squeaking)

26:08.984 --> 26:12.612
(pipes rattling)

26:23.999 --> 26:27.085
Interrogation room B.
Miss Sylvestri's already in there.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.964
Comfy in here, Sarge.
Reminds me of the Bataan death camps.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.132
FRANK: Drive carefully.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.967
-See you in a couple days.
-Bye.

26:34.050 --> 26:34.884
Bye.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.053
Henry.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.639
Have you seen Howard?

26:39.723 --> 26:42.642
Not for a while.
Last time I saw him, he was stewing.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.477
When he turns up tell
him I want to see him.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.604
Alright.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.356
Stan, we've got to do
something about this heat.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.858
Boiler man's on his way.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.444
Sarge, you better have him check
the water pressure, too.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.529
Oh, here, speak of the devil.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.533
Big Bertha's hot to trot today.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.535
You gotta go downstairs right away, Sal.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.579
-You could boil an egg in here.
-On my way.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.998
Bertha and I got an intimate relationship.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.625
Sergeant Buntz around today?

27:06.708 --> 27:08.793
Uh, that would be Lieutenant Buntz.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.879
No, a blondie, tall drink of water.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.589
Tell her Sal's looking for her.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.639
What do you people pay for heat?

27:21.389 --> 27:23.016
No wonder the city's going broke.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.643
Let's finish this quickly.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.812
Charges are dropped
against Ms. Sylvestri in today's arrest.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.023
Additionally,
she is immune from prosecution,

27:30.106 --> 27:32.192
other than crimes of violence
during the period

27:32.275 --> 27:33.985
-her business is under surveillance.
-Deal.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.322
Purpose of surveillance
is arrest and prosecution

27:37.405 --> 27:41.117
of male Caucasian,
tattooed, approximately 35,

27:41.201 --> 27:43.953
suspected in various armed robberies
of drugstores

27:44.037 --> 27:45.372
during the past six weeks.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.290
Doesn't narrow the field much, gentlemen.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.541
All we got.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.798
Where'd you learn to give tattoos?

27:54.881 --> 27:56.049
San Diego.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.551
Come on in. I'll give you a butterfly.

27:59.844 --> 28:00.887
Already got one.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.975
STAN: No, no, we got a Norman Buntz.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.727
Hey, Tommy!

28:07.811 --> 28:09.854
They don't call you Guido over here?

28:09.938 --> 28:10.897
Tommy Donahue.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.607
We were partnered at the Heights.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.026
-Stan Jablonski.
-Stan's our turnout sergeant.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.153
How you doing? You got a place?

28:17.237 --> 28:18.363
Yeah, come on.

28:18.446 --> 28:19.614
Good to meet you.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.410
It's everything they say.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.911
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.040
You gotta take a ride with me, Guid.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.209
Yeah? Who we gonna see?

28:31.292 --> 28:33.253
A juice guy, one Edward Fertello.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.380
I believe Edward needs to be arrested.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.090
I ought to hit you right in the head.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.509
Yeah, please give me a lecture now.
That's what I was hoping I could hear.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.261
When you gonna smarten up, Tommy?

28:41.344 --> 28:42.345
Hey, no price.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.848
(sighs) How much you owe?

28:44.931 --> 28:47.726
Couple of bucks. Hey, this guy's a crook.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.519
What difference does it make what I owe?

28:49.602 --> 28:52.021
Oh, are we arresting Mr. Fertello?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.190
We're not playing "improve my loan," huh?

28:54.274 --> 28:56.401
We are arresting him.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.862
I may have subsequent plans.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.658
(sighs)

29:03.742 --> 29:06.536
What, are they giving you female hormones
up here, Guid?

29:06.619 --> 29:08.163
-Shut up.
-(chuckles)

29:09.789 --> 29:10.623
When?

29:10.707 --> 29:14.210
Now. Guy eats at the Ginzo Social Club.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.632
(sighs)

29:19.716 --> 29:22.719
Now, look, uh, I'm not happy, Tommy.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.680
We're policemen, Norm.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.807
We're doing our duty.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.851
Happy don't enter in.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.519
(sighs)

29:38.693 --> 29:40.153
Ain't it kind of hot in here?

29:40.737 --> 29:42.906
We're trying to locate
the source of the problem.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.115
What can I do for you?

29:44.199 --> 29:45.742
Just give me an educated guess.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.161
How much bail do you think
they'll want for Bobby Angel?

29:48.244 --> 29:50.455
I just book them, mister.
I don't fix their bail.

29:50.538 --> 29:51.581
Yeah.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.458
-Officer?
-Uh-huh?

29:53.541 --> 29:55.960
What do you suppose the bail's gonna be

29:56.044 --> 29:57.837
for Bobby's hoo-ha down
there at the storage?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.839
I don't think it makes much difference.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.842
As far as I know,
Bobby ain't got no money, does he?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.345
I'll go it for him.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.222
You'll go it for him
after all that hoo-ha?

30:08.473 --> 30:09.766
Course, I can relate to that.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.935
There is something
about that jerk, isn't there?

30:12.018 --> 30:13.937
It's a particular kind of jerk.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.480
The probable truth is,

30:15.563 --> 30:17.357
until Bobby runs out of people like us,

30:17.440 --> 30:19.776
he ain't never gonna
cut it as a human being.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.403
That should do it. Hold the bail for him.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.113
Tell him, uh...

30:25.031 --> 30:27.075
hell, tell him
it's from some secret admirer.

30:27.158 --> 30:30.370
-(telephone rings)
-Hey, Luce, look who's here.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.747
Fabian, how you doing?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.416
-Hey, Joe.
-Good to see you, buddy, how are you?

30:35.500 --> 30:36.835
-Great.
-Look at you.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.837
It's like he went
and turned into a beanpole.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.088
It's hot in here.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.507
They're working on it.
They're gonna fix it.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.592
Joseph, uh, excuse us for a second.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.762
Sure. Listen, what about dinner,
all of us, tonight?

30:48.429 --> 30:49.430
-Come on.
-Great!

30:49.514 --> 30:51.182
Alright, I'll see you later.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.685
I have to talk to you about some stuff.

30:53.768 --> 30:55.228
About me staying with you?

30:56.312 --> 30:57.647
Yeah, about that.

30:57.730 --> 30:58.648
I want to.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.943
You don't wanna
go back to your grandmother's?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.736
I don't like it there so much.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.864
My grandmother doesn't have any patience,

31:05.947 --> 31:08.992
-and she's always mad at me.
-You don't wanna stay with your mom?

31:09.450 --> 31:13.079
When you called me, I'd been asking
for you to call me for a couple of weeks.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.081
Fabian.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.711
If you lived with me,
I'd be like your mom,

31:19.794 --> 31:21.629
which means
you'd have to enroll in school,

31:21.713 --> 31:23.006
and you have to do what I say.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.591
That's okay. You're not too strict.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.509
We'll have to get the courts
to give their okay.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.386
Hire a lawyer and everything.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.346
Lawyers charge a lot of money, huh?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.849
Yeah, that's why
I wanna know if you're sure.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.601
Well, pretty sure.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.436
Which is it, sure or pretty sure?

31:36.519 --> 31:38.730
I don't want you to spend a lot of money.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.899
Don't worry about it. That's my problem.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.443
Otherwise, okay?

31:43.526 --> 31:44.444
Okay.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.113
(chuckles)

31:47.196 --> 31:50.158
(mumbling)

31:50.909 --> 31:52.535
Night-combat conditions.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.954
Become the environment.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.373
Come on, Ivan.

32:00.084 --> 32:03.713
See if you like
what this does to your engines.

32:03.796 --> 32:09.052
-(rattling)
-(mumbling)

32:17.185 --> 32:21.105
-(engine chugging)
-(water dripping)

32:45.088 --> 32:46.798
-(mumbling)
-Ugh!

32:49.258 --> 32:51.886
You shanghaied the wrong year, my friend.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.975
(pipes squeak)

32:57.058 --> 32:59.394
(engine chugging)

33:03.481 --> 33:05.441
That's why nobody likes
dealing with you guys.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.359
Shut up, Eddie.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.486
And that's why ex-cops don't get a loan.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.571
Look at my eyes, Eddie.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.948
Figure out how much I care.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.075
Don't screw around
with my phonebook, please!

33:14.158 --> 33:15.535
What does this look like, Norm?

33:15.618 --> 33:17.537
Could it contain some sort of code?

33:17.620 --> 33:18.705
Aw.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.877
What you want, you freaking deadbeat?
You're already six weeks overdue.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.254
Ugh!

33:26.337 --> 33:27.797
TOMMY: No attitude, Eddie.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.549
Attitude brings fractures.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.843
Alright, alright.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.220
Alright. Oh! Oh.

33:36.639 --> 33:37.724
(moans)

33:39.726 --> 33:41.644
Hey, go on back to the card game, fellas.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.021
Deal another hand, huh?

33:43.104 --> 33:45.064
Go on! Get out of here, you hear me?

33:51.529 --> 33:53.489
-Tommy?
-Norman.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.076
Believe this?
This was total mistaken identity.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.537
Eddie's being a real prince.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.998
Go away.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.218
(car door closes)

34:20.058 --> 34:21.100
Stan.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.895
Is there a window still open?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.772
No, windows are tight.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.232
He must have shut down the boiler
so he could work on it.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.902
Could get double-triple pneumonia in here.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
I'm suing for loss of income.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.827
Somebody please go down
and check on that damn repairman.

34:39.911 --> 34:40.995
My pleasure.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.372
Mine, too.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.419
In English. That figures.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.421
Left over from Langley's.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.965
(chuckles)
Great progress you've made, Boris.

34:54.050 --> 34:54.884
(door opens)

34:54.967 --> 34:56.385
Huh?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.595
Damn!

34:58.471 --> 35:00.056
They're looking for their mate.

35:01.474 --> 35:05.228
Very well, Mr. Molotov,
they're coming down to you.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.396
Fortitude, Ballantine.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.816
The greater glory lies beyond this world.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.110
(mumbling)

35:12.193 --> 35:13.820
Stand back, whoever you are,

35:13.903 --> 35:16.447
or this gulag goes to Davy Jones' locker!

35:16.531 --> 35:17.490
Lieutenant Hunter?

35:17.573 --> 35:18.908
(mumbling)

35:18.991 --> 35:20.660
A rescue party!

35:20.743 --> 35:23.830
You've saved me! Are you alright?

35:23.913 --> 35:25.164
Have we seized the ship?

35:25.248 --> 35:27.041
-Lieutenant!
-What?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.751
This is the Hill Street Station.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.503
(mumbling)

35:31.129 --> 35:33.422
Some unfortunate pawn of the commissar.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.091
Now that we're in command,

35:35.174 --> 35:36.425
can we medevac him out of here?

35:38.219 --> 35:39.720
Sure, Howard.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.730
I wasn't being recalcitrant
on this apology.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.065
Don't worry about it, Howard.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.109
The chief's issuing
a "department regrets."

35:53.192 --> 35:54.485
I see.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.487
Other than a concussion,
I think you survived

35:56.571 --> 35:58.698
your encounter with the steam pipes,
Lieutenant.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.408
(chuckles) Thank you, Doctor.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.618
I wouldn't drive for 24 hours.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.328
I'll drive him home.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.622
It was a most extraordinary experience.

36:07.081 --> 36:11.627
The entire hallucination had
this most extraordinary sense of reality.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.840
-What's the matter, Howard?
-(chuckling)

36:15.923 --> 36:18.551
I'm just so glad to be back in America.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.639
-(moaning)
-(telephone ringing)

36:23.723 --> 36:25.183
-Stan?
-Hmm?

36:28.436 --> 36:30.313
Let's notify the city attorney.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.607
-Civil suit?
-Big.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.151
(moaning)

36:36.777 --> 36:39.864
Blondie! My tall drink of water!

36:41.991 --> 36:43.743
Why don't you go back to sleep?

37:02.595 --> 37:04.555
Well, ain't you nice to say so?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.724
You know, I just want
to tell you something.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.267
You have been a perfect gentleman,

37:08.351 --> 37:11.062
and I don't know
where those stories come from.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.065
Well, I wanna thank you
folks for having me.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.525
And God bless you
and old Ned Parsons, too,

37:16.609 --> 37:18.194
for helping me out in court today.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.154
Where do you have to go so soon, Bobby?

37:20.238 --> 37:23.407
Well, I'm beginning to think
you folks is temperance.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.660
And seeing how it's getting
that time of evening,

37:25.743 --> 37:27.203
I like to wet my whistle!

37:27.286 --> 37:29.372
Oh, Andy, do you think a single drink--

37:29.455 --> 37:32.625
-Daryl Ann, he--
-Don't you folks disagree on my account.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.211
Oh, Andy, my daddy's
sweet briar corn mash--

37:35.294 --> 37:36.963
it's made in the family way.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.340
It couldn't do any harm
on a cold night like this.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.551
-Daryl Ann, I--
-Honey, sing him one of your songs.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.345
You write some tunes, Andy, do you?

37:44.428 --> 37:46.722
-Well, sir, yeah.
-Sing him the police one!

37:47.807 --> 37:50.768
Okay. I'll pick you one.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.230
(playing the guitar)
<i>♪ I am a policeman in a... ♪</i>

37:54.313 --> 37:56.774
I can't sing in front of you.
I'm too embarrassed.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.694
Just a little case of stage fright, Andy.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.989
Boy, honey ain't sweeter
than straight from the comb!

38:05.491 --> 38:06.993
Oh, my lord.

38:09.745 --> 38:12.373
Whoo-oo-oo!

38:12.456 --> 38:14.583
Boy, that would kill an ordinary man!

38:14.667 --> 38:18.379
Oh, mama, help me put out the fire!

38:18.462 --> 38:20.548
Bobby, don't be tickling me, now!

38:20.631 --> 38:22.675
(both laughing)

That's about it! Stop it!

38:45.614 --> 38:48.784
Wait a minute, Andy.
I'm just having a little fun.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.829
Oh, I gotta get my inspiration
from somewhere!

38:51.912 --> 38:54.832
Not with my wife, you don't!
I'm gonna tell you something.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.543
You just crossed
the Mason-Dixon line, hoss!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.670
Get out of my house!

38:59.754 --> 39:02.548
-One-way?
-Don't you never come back here again!

39:04.050 --> 39:06.719
Hey, well, like I always say,

39:06.802 --> 39:08.179
don't count me out,

39:08.262 --> 39:09.680
but don't count on me either.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.515
-(laughs)
-Get out.

39:11.599 --> 39:12.558
(door slam)

39:15.853 --> 39:18.022
You guys could be here for a while.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.149
He won't come in unless he pulls a job.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.485
I've been on worse stakeouts.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.741
-You wanna play some gin?
-Oh, sure. Winner plays the snake?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.951
(chuckles)

39:31.035 --> 39:32.828
You don't wanna play Salome.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.497
She cheats.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.165
Yo, babe, company coming.

39:37.249 --> 39:38.084
Right.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.924
Hey, Lucius, you put on a little weight?

39:45.007 --> 39:47.218
Terry. (chuckles)

39:47.301 --> 39:48.677
My main woman.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.513
(laughs)

39:50.596 --> 39:52.431
Yeah. Say, bro.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.557
What you got?

39:54.433 --> 39:56.811
Something your friend might like.

39:57.770 --> 40:01.023
Pure cashmere, baby. Look about your size.

40:01.107 --> 40:01.941
Looks good.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.401
<i>Try it on.</i>

40:03.484 --> 40:06.278
<i>I got something else here for Ter.</i>

40:06.862 --> 40:09.949
You been hitting
those restaurant checkrooms again, Lucius.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.618
Me? No, no, these fell off a truck.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.540
-How much?
-$1,500 for both.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.291
$400.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.336
(laughs) Wait. That ain't right.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.214
No, no, I got to have
a whole lot more than that.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.133
-I got problems.
-Take it or leave it.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.219
Afraid I'm gonna
have to take all of it, then, Terry.

40:30.302 --> 40:32.721
<i>Just freeze. Take it easy.</i>

40:32.805 --> 40:34.140
This ain't smart.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.516
How's this thing open?

40:35.599 --> 40:39.645
Just tell me how this thing opens.
You know how it opens?

40:39.728 --> 40:42.064
Hey, baby! I want a tat.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.482
Oh, man!

40:43.566 --> 40:45.234
I ought to make you eat this.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.944
Don't hurt me, man!

40:47.027 --> 40:49.196
Don't hurt me, man! Take the coats!

40:49.280 --> 40:50.281
(grunts)

40:55.369 --> 40:57.580
I didn't want to jeopardize
the undercover.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.832
Men of action turn me all the way on.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.086
Hey, yeah, that's the gym.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.046
That's where I used to play volleyball

41:06.130 --> 41:08.549
when all the guys were playing basketball.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.260
Now the girls probably
play basketball, too, huh?

41:11.343 --> 41:12.595
Yeah, all the time.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.805
Where's them volleyball players?

41:15.848 --> 41:16.682
Who's that?

41:17.808 --> 41:20.811
That is Sister Elizabeth.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.857
She was my homeroom teacher,
and she also coached the volleyball team.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.860
She's a nun, right?
That's why she has that scarf on.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.111
Mm-hmm. Right.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.198
Is that you?

41:33.365 --> 41:34.825
No, I don't think so.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.119
Come on, Fabe.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.205
What do you think about the school?

41:39.288 --> 41:40.539
It seems pretty cool.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.749
Yeah.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.876
That's you, ain't it, Luce?

41:45.711 --> 41:47.463
-Maybe.
-(chuckling)

41:47.546 --> 41:49.256
Why do you got your eyes closed?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.591
I don't know. Because...

41:50.674 --> 41:52.885
that's what I was doing
when the guy took the picture.

41:52.968 --> 41:56.555
Oh, give me a break, you dumpster.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.433
(indistinct chatter)

42:07.691 --> 42:08.859
(clears throat)

42:08.943 --> 42:11.403
I, uh, know we all wish Walter Callahan

42:11.487 --> 42:13.739
a quick victory
in his bout with the flu bug.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.699
Father Farren's going
to intercede for Walt

42:15.783 --> 42:18.077
-with an influential friend.
-(laughter)

42:18.160 --> 42:20.162
Our loss is also our gain.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.999
Like me, I'm certain all of you
followed the deliberations

42:24.083 --> 42:25.334
and applauded the findings

42:25.417 --> 42:27.503
of the so-called Furillo Commission.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.588
But I can claim a leg up

42:29.672 --> 42:31.757
in having followed the career
of this gentleman

42:31.840 --> 42:34.009
for a number of years before that.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.428
I remember, eight years ago now,

42:36.512 --> 42:38.764
reading
about a persevering young lieutenant

42:38.847 --> 42:41.475
arresting Al "Big Ben" Biamonte.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.811
And in the intervening years,
I've watched him grow

42:43.894 --> 42:45.271
from strength to strength.

42:45.354 --> 42:48.107
It's my honor
to introduce someone I suspect

42:48.190 --> 42:50.401
we may be hearing more from and about

42:50.484 --> 42:51.944
in the months and years to come.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.488
Captain Francis X. Furillo.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.698
(applauding)

43:02.955 --> 43:06.125
Thank you, Father Walton, Father Farren,

43:06.208 --> 43:07.626
distinguished guests.

43:08.168 --> 43:12.881
Uh, I want to thank Mr. Wells
for his gracious introduction.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.344
It is the small consolation
of being a late replacement

43:17.428 --> 43:21.056
that no one expects you
to have a speech prepared.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.309
I'm not going to disappoint you.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.977
(laughter)

43:26.645 --> 43:28.522
You were gangbusters, Furillo.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.191
Yeah, I think it went alright.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.318
(chuckles)

43:33.944 --> 43:37.197
Shall I tell you
what our new friend, Mr. Wells, told me?

43:37.281 --> 43:38.866
Mm-hmm.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.201
Promise not to get a swelled head?

43:41.285 --> 43:43.329
What did Graham have to say?

43:43.829 --> 43:46.790
Graham said, "Your husband
has marvelous presence."

43:46.874 --> 43:47.916
Hmm.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.002
I said, "Graham,

43:50.085 --> 43:52.296
you're preaching among the converted."

43:56.091 --> 43:59.428
I wish I had a peek
at my friend Graham's hole card.

43:59.511 --> 44:00.554
Hmm.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.557
Relax, Furillo.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.226
Enjoy the ride.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.395
Don't change the subject.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.815
(both laugh)

44:14.068 --> 44:15.110
That's them now.

44:21.784 --> 44:22.785
Hi, Aunty.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.745
Oh, honey.

44:28.832 --> 44:31.126
George Foster,
Foster and Sons Mortuary, sir.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.127
Is this the departed?

44:33.128 --> 44:35.005
My assistant will bring
the car around, sir.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.341
Trip all right?

44:37.424 --> 44:40.135
It was fine. How's Uncle Cy?

44:40.219 --> 44:42.805
Oh, he has his aches and pains.

44:42.888 --> 44:44.390
You'll see him back at the house.

44:44.473 --> 44:47.434
I was planning on you staying with us.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.977
Appreciate it.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.147
Welcome home, Leland.

44:52.940 --> 44:53.982
Leland?

44:54.900 --> 44:58.028
You didn't know
that your daddy's first name was Leland?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.321
Where did Reggie come from?

44:59.822 --> 45:02.825
His name was Leland Reginald Hill.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.912
I used to say your daddy
had a bank president's name

45:06.995 --> 45:09.415
and a bank robber's heart.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.709
(both laugh)

45:11.792 --> 45:13.919
I'm glad you've brought him here.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.672
Didn't know where else
to bring him, Aunty.

45:16.755 --> 45:20.467
I meant, I'm glad you came with him.

45:22.010 --> 45:25.764
(melancholic music playing)

45:31.603 --> 45:33.188
(sighs)

45:33.272 --> 45:34.565
Appreciate the rhythm, Guid.

45:34.648 --> 45:36.400
The kid I'm paired with now
don't know the play.

45:36.483 --> 45:37.443
Yeah.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.280
Alright, let's get it off our chests.

45:41.363 --> 45:45.075
What part don't you know about, Tommy?
What part do I have to tell you?

45:45.159 --> 45:48.036
I didn't wanna get into this.
There's some stuff going on at home.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.663
That's bull.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.957
Oh, man, you're gonna tell me
what this money's for?

45:52.040 --> 45:55.127
Obviously, you think it's gambling.
It happens to be a domestic problem.

45:55.210 --> 45:57.004
Tommy, A, I don't believe you,

45:57.087 --> 45:58.797
and B, this sucked, no matter what.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.799
Which Righteous Brother were you?

46:00.883 --> 46:03.218
This was a stone, freaking shakedown!

46:03.302 --> 46:05.053
This crap's why I transferred!

46:05.971 --> 46:09.975
You transferred?
What happened to division pulled you?

46:10.893 --> 46:12.686
I put in for a transfer,

46:12.770 --> 46:14.605
and this kind of stuff is why.

46:14.688 --> 46:16.023
Jeez, that's beautiful.

46:17.483 --> 46:18.609
You asked to split up?

46:18.692 --> 46:20.486
Forget about what's right or wrong.

46:20.569 --> 46:22.613
You keep this up,
you're gonna get whacked.

46:22.696 --> 46:25.240
Not me. I'm a defender of the community.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.577
Plus, I thought I was your pal.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.705
Unh-unh. No, this was no friend.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.500
This was muscle you wanted today.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.294
That must have been someone else I stepped
in front of a couple of years ago.

46:37.377 --> 46:38.337
Must not have been you.

46:39.046 --> 46:40.380
No, that was me.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.092
But you were different.

46:44.176 --> 46:46.970
Oh, I'm a different guy!
I must not have a scar, then!

46:47.054 --> 46:48.430
That was a cheap freakin' shot.

46:48.514 --> 46:51.016
Didn't feel cheap when I took it!
This look cheap to you?

46:56.438 --> 46:58.273
I'm wrong.

46:59.733 --> 47:00.609
I'm sorry.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.570
You don't believe it, see, but...

47:05.239 --> 47:07.074
I love you like a brother.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.868
(sighs)
Yeah, you've been there for me, too.

47:11.328 --> 47:13.664
Just hate what you're doing
to yourself, Tommy.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.542
And honest to God,

47:17.334 --> 47:19.628
I keep being afraid you're gonna get hit.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.590
I win the lottery next week,
this all goes away.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.845
(chuckles)

47:27.928 --> 47:30.430
Look, you made me ruin my vines.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.852
(sighs) You take care, Tommy.

47:37.437 --> 47:40.148
Hey, Guid.
Let's see each other, all right?

47:42.860 --> 47:45.821
No. I don't wanna see you no more.

47:52.619 --> 47:53.996
(sniffles)

48:02.629 --> 48:04.631
(theme music playing)
