a physical battle,

45:35.272 --> 45:36.621

but at the same time,

46:02.342 --> 46:03.822
he's poking at her
a little bit,

in the herd are digital.

does a great job

46:22.188 --> 46:25.670
of blending the real
and the CG together.

saw the footage come back

she's trying to, like,

47:02.402 --> 47:05.405
reach for the person that
she loves and hang onto him,

47:05.536 --> 47:10.106

and through when she knows

47:10.236 --> 47:12.369
that she has to have
the limb severed,

47:12.499 --> 47:14.893

about somebody else
