00:01.501 --> 00:04.045
(crying)

00:04.129 --> 00:07.090
Oh, look, it's Mr. Rabbit.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.342
He's come to play with you.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.343
Hiya, Frankie.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.386
How are you today?

00:11.469 --> 00:12.554
Terrified of rabbits, Dad.

00:12.637 --> 00:13.763
Thanks for asking.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.056
Come here, baby.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.600
Hi! Hi!

00:18.685 --> 00:20.061
Nat, he's wet.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.980
No wonder he's hysterical.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.106
Come on, let's go change you.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.733
No, please. Let me.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.317
I'll get the diaper bag.
Here's the rabbit.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.613
(entrance bell rings)

00:30.697 --> 00:32.323
Oh, how's Frankie?

00:32.406 --> 00:35.785
Kid gets three squares
of breast milk a day,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.663
{\an3}has women powdering his butt
on a regular basis.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.123
What does he have to cry about?

00:40.206 --> 00:42.417
{\an1}Mm, well, maybe it's
the company he's keeping.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.586
{\an1}Valerie should come
with a warning label.

00:44.669 --> 00:45.754
Broken record, Kel.

00:45.837 --> 00:51.134
{\an1}I just don't know how someone
so smart could be so blind.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.677
Okay, I'll bite.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.137
What are you talking about?

00:54.220 --> 00:55.138
Nothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.598
Nothing?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.933
No, see you brought this up.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.477
So, you have to give.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.313
You really don't know, do you?

01:03.396 --> 01:05.272
What are you talking about, Kel?

01:05.355 --> 01:07.484
Valerie claims
to have been pregnant

01:07.567 --> 01:08.777
and had an abortion.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.653
When?

01:10.737 --> 01:11.654
Last week.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.531
She cried all over my shoulder.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.657
Steve's, too.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.951
VALERIE:
Here's the happy baby.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.495
High and dry.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.996
Oh. Ooh...
Yeah.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.664
NAT:
Come here, my little darling.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.625
{\an1}Whoa, your little
hat went off.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.960
{\an1}Hey, you've got
a way with kids, Val.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.837
{\an1}Yeah, like Custer had
a way with the Indians.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.173
{\an3}I don't get it, why wouldn't
she tell me about this?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.634
For some reason,
she has trouble lying to you.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.969
A problem she doesn't have
with the rest of us.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.642
♪ ♪

02:07.210 --> 02:09.211
♪ ♪

02:32.902 --> 02:34.779
♪ ♪

03:17.196 --> 03:18.781
I can't believe it.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.701
{\an1}David inherited $250,000
from his grandfather?

03:21.784 --> 03:22.911
That's right.
Thanks.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.287
{\an3}Wow!

03:24.370 --> 03:26.247
Your dad must have
loved him very much.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.374
David was his only grandson.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.626
They were very
fond of each other.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.793
You know, David hasn't said

03:30.877 --> 03:32.128
a word about this to anyone.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.296
{\an1}MEL:
That's probably just as well.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.631
I'm really worried about what

03:34.714 --> 03:35.840
this money might do to him.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.675
Unfortunately, his grandfather
had a lot more confidence

03:37.759 --> 03:39.469
in him than I do.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.971
Well, he has been going through
a lot of changes lately.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.473
{\an3}Donna, you don't
have to protect him.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.017
We all know what his behavior
has been like lately.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.603
And you're afraid the money
is going to make it worse.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.646
David wants his freedom.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.564
Now, thanks to his grandfather,
he can afford it.

03:52.899 --> 03:53.983
(phone ringing)

03:54.067 --> 03:55.526
I'll get it.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.821
(ringing stops abruptly)

03:58.905 --> 04:00.823
All right.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.991
(ringing resumes)

04:02.075 --> 04:03.117
(groans)

04:04.243 --> 04:05.328
Hello?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.329
Hey, beautiful.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.330
Hi.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.832
Um, I'll be right back.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.167
Did you just hang up?

04:11.250 --> 04:12.126
Just a little phone code.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.213
One ring means that
I am crazy about you.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.339
I see, and what does
two rings mean?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.300
Means that I wish
I was with you.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.053
I don't, uh, think I'm ready

04:22.136 --> 04:23.638
to know what three rings means.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.098
(chuckling):
Good.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.849
'Cause I'm not sure
I'm ready to tell you.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.227
Um, look, I, um, I have to go.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.145
So, I'll just see you
at campus, okay?

04:31.229 --> 04:32.855
All right, go.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.315
All right, bye.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.860
Sorry.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.905
So, uh, what do you want us
to do, keep an eye on him?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.157
I would really
appreciate it, Donna.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.033
I'm just concerned that

04:44.117 --> 04:45.660
{\an3}he might be getting
in over his head.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.537
Well, I would talk
to him, but I don't...

04:47.620 --> 04:49.080
I don't think
he's gonna listen to me.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.373
I'll look out for him, Mel.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.624
Thanks, Donna.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.210
Okay, I'm gonna get
back to the office.

04:54.293 --> 04:55.378
See ya.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.171
Bye.

04:57.255 --> 05:01.676
(phone rings twice,
then stops)

05:08.683 --> 05:10.893
Hey, there, big fella,

05:10.977 --> 05:12.895
{\an1}you got a tapeworm
or what?

05:12.979 --> 05:13.855
(mumbling)

05:13.938 --> 05:16.566
{\an3}Rowing burns a thousand
calories an hour.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.942
I'm sure it does.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.527
You know, it's amazing that

05:19.610 --> 05:21.237
you can keep on
any weight at all,

05:21.320 --> 05:24.115
what with all this rowing
and the secrets you keep.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.408
Secrets?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.076
I don't know how
you do it, man.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.870
The anxiety.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.246
The not sleeping at night.

05:30.329 --> 05:31.414
Th-The sweats...

05:31.497 --> 05:33.082
You're amazing, man.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.585
Hmm, um...

05:35.668 --> 05:38.212
You know what?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.548
I did take $20
from the cookie jar once,

05:40.631 --> 05:42.091
but I put it back
two days later.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.426
I'm not talking about
the cookie jar, Steve.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.053
I'm talking about Valerie.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.095
Why didn't you tell me?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.306
Look, I wasn't trying to
hide anything from you.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.849
I found out by accident.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.100
I didn't want
to make things worse.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.977
So you told "Darth Taylor"?

05:53.061 --> 05:55.605
{\an5}(snickers)
I just figured
she should talk to a woman.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.732
Right church, wrong pew,
my friend.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.901
{\an1}(chuckling)
Kelly thinks Valerie

05:59.984 --> 06:02.320
is lying about the whole thing,
including the abortion.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.946
Yeah, well, here's what I know.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.698
Valerie said
Kenny took her to the clinic.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.574
Kelly says he didn't.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.284
{\an3}Valerie told me they
gave her Diazepam.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.911
But then she told me
that she drove home.

06:09.994 --> 06:10.995
How's that?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.955
And that's your whole case?
Yeah.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.582
Next, you're going
to be telling me

06:14.665 --> 06:16.125
Colonel Mustard did it in the
observatory with a lead pipe.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.169
(chuckling)
I'm going to the marina.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.838
Steve, what do you think?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.298
{\an3}I don't know
what to think.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.925
Things just don't add up.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.301
So, you think she's lying, too?

06:25.384 --> 06:27.970
Yeah... it's Valerie.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.264
{\an1}See you later.
Yeah.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.485
KELLY:
Hi, Val.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.821
Kelly.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.447
How are you?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.658
Obviously not
as good as you.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
Mm, I can't help it.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.495
{\an1}Telling the truth
feels so good.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.788
Well, hip hip hooray.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.997
{\an1}Mm, I mean,
when I told Brandon

06:55.081 --> 06:56.833
{\an1}about what happened
between you and Kenny,

06:56.916 --> 06:59.836
{\an1}I felt like just
a huge weight had been

06:59.919 --> 07:01.796
{\an1}lifted right off
my shoulders.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.548
Hi, what can I get you?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.007
{\an1}Espresso,
decaffeinated.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.009
Coffee, black.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.803
Exactly which part about

07:08.886 --> 07:10.805
what happened between me
and Kenny did you tell?

07:10.888 --> 07:13.474
Mm, let's see.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.351
Pregnancy, abortion.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.352
The basics.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.855
God, I hate you.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.190
But when I got to the part about
how I didn't believe any of it,

07:21.274 --> 07:24.026
mm, talk about the truth
setting you free.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.320
If you knew what
I went through...

07:26.404 --> 07:27.864
Save the sob story for Brandon.

07:27.947 --> 07:28.823
You're going to need it.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.033
He'll believe me.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.702
Well, he always has.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.662
But sooner or later, he won't.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.497
My money's on sooner.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.040
{\an3}Together
or separate?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.168
{\an1}Together.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.961
My treat.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.217
Power stroke! One...

07:48.301 --> 07:49.093
two...

07:49.177 --> 07:50.094
{\an3}three...

07:50.178 --> 07:52.597
So, what do you think?

07:55.474 --> 07:56.893
They look pretty good.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.228
They look... better.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.189
Come on, admit it.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.232
{\an1}What they've done
is pretty impressive.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.193
{\an3}Clare, guy weighs
300 pounds.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.569
{\an3}He loses a
hundred pounds,

08:06.652 --> 08:07.612
{\an3}everybody says
they're impressed.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.197
{\an3}I say he shouldn't
have weighed 300

08:09.280 --> 08:11.741
in the first place.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.451
Good times, guys.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.912
{\an1}Well, if it isn't the
scourge of the seven seas.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.747
{\an3}Why don't you go
sit on an oar?

08:17.830 --> 08:18.915
You guys are looking good.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.374
{\an3}So are you.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.710
{\an3}You too, Captain SPF.
You know,

08:22.793 --> 08:24.754
that sunblock on your
nose is so becoming,

08:24.837 --> 08:26.839
{\an3}I think your ears
are getting jealous.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.593
Oh, abbreviations 101, isn't
that a step up for you, Sanders?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.595
{\an1}Here we go, guys.
Hands on.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.640
{\an1}Over the head.
Ready, up!

08:35.722 --> 08:36.933
Here we go!
You know, Sanders,

08:37.015 --> 08:38.476
{\an1}I'm glad you guys
are halfway decent.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.311
That way, maybe you can
stay afloat long enough

08:40.394 --> 08:41.729
{\an3}to see us kick
your sorry butts.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.731
Oh, yeah, we'll see you
cross the finish line,

08:43.813 --> 08:44.732
from the winner's circle.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.733
{\an6}(chuckling):
Yeah.
All right,

08:45.816 --> 08:47.276
{\an5}Take it, guys.
now that we've
had a chance

08:47.360 --> 08:48.819
to measure our manhood,
let's go in the water.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.072
{\an3}No, no, no, let me give you
a little advice, Sanders.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.741
{\an3}Quit now and save yourself
a lot of embarrassment.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.159
The only thing I'm
embarrassed about

08:55.243 --> 08:57.620
is how little we have
riding on this race.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.496
CLARE:
Uh, don't go there,

08:58.579 --> 08:59.914
{\an3}either of you.
No, no,

08:59.997 --> 09:01.249
if he wants to dig his
grave a little deeper,

09:01.332 --> 09:02.250
who are we to stop him?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.251
Let's up the ante.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.961
I wouldn't.
I would.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.128
Fine.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.713
I'll be in the shell.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.758
{\an3}Great girl.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.801
But you already know that.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.595
Loser serves the winner's
frat dinner for a week.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.596
Plus dates.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.931
Fine, you'll be doing it.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.099
Oh, tell me what
Clare's favorite meal is.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.726
I just want to make sure
you get a chance to serve it.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.478
Oh, that's easy.
That would be pile of Steve,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.106
masquerading around
a lovely almond massage oil,

09:25.189 --> 09:26.649
rolphed, not rubbed.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.484
Whatever. So, it's a bet?

09:28.567 --> 09:29.944
Oh, it's a pleasure.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.445
Right.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.615
(exhales)

09:40.246 --> 09:42.164
Hey, I can't decide
what to lead with.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.666
{\an1}The alumni
endowment drive or...

09:43.749 --> 09:46.460
Are you listening to me?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.088
{\an3}By the way, there's a naked
woman in your office.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.756
Shall I tell her to wait?

09:50.840 --> 09:51.716
Say you're pregnant.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.843
I'm pregnant.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.136
That's not funny.
Say your pregnant.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.345
Do you tell your best friend?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.013
Absolutely.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.347
And what if you get an abortion?

09:58.431 --> 09:59.849
I wouldn't get an abortion.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.017
{\an3}But if I did, I would
definitely tell

10:01.100 --> 10:03.144
because I'd want
a shoulder to cry on.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.729
And what if the
shoulder was mine?

10:04.812 --> 10:08.649
Well, you're not an easy
person to confess to.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.193
Okay, say you made
the whole thing up

10:11.277 --> 10:13.321
just to get back at
some guy who hurt you?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.905
No, then I wouldn't tell anyone.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.949
That's what I was afraid of.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.743
Any chance of film at 11,
so I can figure out

10:18.826 --> 10:19.827
what you're talking about?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.871
I wish I knew myself.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.082
{\an5}(sighs)
Why don't you just ask the
mystery girl straight out?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.668
No, I can't do that;
I need more information first.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.129
Then ask the guy.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.215
That's a good idea.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.551
Thanks, Tracy, you da man.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.845
{\an1}Oh, uh, don't lead
with the endowment drive.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.388
Money stories in block three.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.682
Thank you, fearless leader.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.685
David, hi.
Hey.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.895
Hey, how's it going?

10:45.978 --> 10:49.398
{\an3}Did you know that as early as
1835, Alexis de Tocqueville

10:49.482 --> 10:52.735
predicted that America and
Russia would be two superpowers?

10:52.818 --> 10:54.528
{\an1}Mm... no,
can't say I did.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.531
This guy is a French political
scientist that we're studying.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.867
{\an3}Now, he knew the
future of the world

10:59.950 --> 11:02.036
{\an3}would be shaped by
two totally backward,

11:02.119 --> 11:03.245
undeveloped countries.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.915
{\an1}Cool. Well, it sounds
like a good class.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.249
{\an3}It's incredible;
I love it.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.584
Okay, whoa, what'd
you do with him?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.502
The real David Silver?

11:09.585 --> 11:10.920
The guy I'm looking for--
downbeat...

11:11.003 --> 11:12.254
Moody?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.631
Yeah, glass half-empty
kind of guy? Mm-hmm.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.799
(laughs)

11:14.882 --> 11:17.051
Uh, he-he changed.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.221
You're really happy, aren't you?

11:20.304 --> 11:22.598
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.558
Of course, I owe a
lot of that to you,

11:24.642 --> 11:25.935
I mean, I wouldn't have even

11:26.018 --> 11:27.895
come back to school
if it wasn't for you.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.398
{\an3}You know, I'm done for
the day, and I've got to go

11:30.481 --> 11:32.066
pick up some stuff
for the house.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.442
You want to come with me?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.443
Yeah, sure.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.404
{\an1}Great. That was easy.
(laughs)

11:36.487 --> 11:39.448
{\an1}(chuckles)

11:39.532 --> 11:41.492
(door opens)

11:41.575 --> 11:42.618
Right this way.
Thanks.

11:42.701 --> 11:43.869
Hi, Kenny.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.705
{\an3}No problem.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.749
{\an3}Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

11:48.833 --> 11:49.959
No, thanks, I'm fine.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.086
Just hold my calls.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.463
So, how you doing?
Good, good, thanks.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.842
{\an5}How's the family?
The family's good,
everyone's good.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.635
Except for Valerie.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.804
Yeah. Well...

12:01.887 --> 12:03.848
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.474
Yeah, I thought you would be.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.101
Look, Brandon,
I feel terrible

12:07.184 --> 12:09.353
about what happened.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.107
Things just got a little, um...
out of control.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.819
Kenny, would you mind telling me
exactly what did happen?

12:18.571 --> 12:22.616
Bottom line, uh,
I fell in love...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.618
with the wrong girl.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.995
But you did love her?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.456
I would have done
anything for her.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.375
Pardon me for noticing, but...

12:31.459 --> 12:33.169
you're still married,

12:33.252 --> 12:35.671
and she went through
this whole thing alone.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.675
Well, she didn't have
to go through it alone, Brandon.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.847
You didn't dump her?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.515
(chuckles)

12:46.599 --> 12:50.227
{\an3}Brandon...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.021
I cared about her.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.355
I wanted to help her.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.357
{\an3}And after she told me
she was pregnant,

12:55.441 --> 12:58.319
{\an3}the only thing that she
wanted from me was my money.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.779
{\an6}She asked you for money?
Well, Valerie
doesn't ask,

13:00.863 --> 13:04.325
she demands, you know--
it's more like ransom.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.703
"Give me money,
or I will have this baby."

13:07.786 --> 13:10.247
"Give me money, or I
will tell your wife."

13:10.331 --> 13:11.874
How much?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.209
Hundred grand.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.753
That's a lot of money.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.213
{\an3}And...

13:17.296 --> 13:20.841
{\an3}when I hesitated
about paying her...

13:20.925 --> 13:25.221
{\an3}she paid a visit to my wife
with a little present.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.348
A box of diapers.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.559
Talk about
your fatal attraction.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.230
So obviously, you, uh,
gave her the money, right?

13:34.313 --> 13:37.191
Yeah. It was worth it
to get her out of my life.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.860
Kenny, do you...

13:39.944 --> 13:43.280
do you know for a fact
that she actually was pregnant?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.907
No.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.284
Um, you know what, to be
honest with you, though,

13:47.368 --> 13:50.621
I don't care--
as long as it's over.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.292
Are we through here?

13:55.376 --> 13:58.212
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.130
{\an1}Thanks for your time
and your honesty, man.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.090
I really appreciate it.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.635
Take care, Brandon.
Okay, thanks. You, too.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.396
{\an5}DONNA:
David, what do you need
a new watch for?

14:15.479 --> 14:16.730
You've already got three.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.816
{\an1}Yeah, but this one's
got a chronometer on it.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.651
{\an1}Did you see that?
Hey, how about this?

14:20.734 --> 14:23.571
You can't... you can't
forget about this, huh?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.781
Oh. Oh, right,
your $200 pen.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.074
{\an1}A bargain.
Designed by NASA.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.993
{\an1}You can write upside down
with this thing.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.578
{\an3}Oh, that makes all
the difference.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.664
{\an1}Okay, fine, how about the, uh,
electric toilet seat warmer.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.624
{\an3}(fake laughing):
Oh, yeah!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.626
{\an3}For those cold Southern
California nights.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.670
{\an3}David, is all this stuff
really necessary?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.130
Donna, that's the point.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.298
I don't get it.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.133
I inherited $250,000!

14:44.216 --> 14:46.385
{\an3}I can do anything
I want to.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.512
I-I can buy all the
stupid stuff I want.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
I can buy you all
the stupid stuff you want.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.473
What do you want?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.600
David, would you calm down?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.143
You're embarrassing me!
(fake laughing)

14:54.226 --> 14:56.145
No, I'm not, Donna--
they love people like me.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.271
I'm an impulse shopper.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.191
{\an1}You know what? Can we please
just get out of here?

15:01.275 --> 15:02.318
Okay?

15:02.401 --> 15:04.153
{\an1}Okay, fine.
Good. Thanks.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.863
{\an3}You know, I've never
been to Australia.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.823
{\an3}How about Egypt? Egypt--
if we left right now

15:07.906 --> 15:10.034
{\an3}I bet you we could be at
the pyramids by breakfast.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.162
{\an5}What do you say?
I'd say that you
lost your mind!

15:13.245 --> 15:15.456
Uh, you know, I really
hope I never find it,

15:15.539 --> 15:17.666
'cause I've never felt
this good in my life.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.003
Excuse me what does it take to
get some service around here?

15:21.086 --> 15:24.465
Donna, I think they
have potato clocks!

15:24.548 --> 15:27.176
{\an6}(sighs):
We should've had
this stuff delivered.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.511
{\an3}We're never gonna get
it all in the cars.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.805
Yeah? Well, you shouldn't
have bought so much stuff.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.474
{\an3}You know, we could
take two trips,

15:33.557 --> 15:35.726
{\an3}but then again, we'd miss
our flight to Cairo.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.061
Would you stop
that already?

15:37.144 --> 15:38.479
Hey, you just
say the word.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.564
{\an5}(chuckles):
Ah, the word
is "binge."

15:41.649 --> 15:43.651
Okay.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.194
{\an3}There.
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
{\an3}Sure.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.073
A twenty?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.033
{\an3}What? What?
The guy worked hard.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.078
Don't you think you're just
a <i> little</i> over the top there?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.788
It's cool, isn't it?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.833
{\an1}David! What
are you doing?

15:59.917 --> 16:00.834
What?

16:00.918 --> 16:03.545
{\an3}What, I'm not allowed
to kiss somebody I like?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.756
{\an1}No. Not like that,
not here.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.258
You know, I'm beginning
to think Mel was right.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.095
{\an3}Wait, what does my father
have to do with this?

16:11.178 --> 16:15.557
He was just... he-he's
a little worried about you.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.226
And?

16:17.309 --> 16:20.562
And he didn't think you'd listen
to him, and he was concerned,

16:20.646 --> 16:23.399
so he asked me
to keep an eye on you.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.942
That's great.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.361
{\an6}(chuckles):
My father's got you
spying for him.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.238
No, I... I didn't say that.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.907
{\an3}What, is he afraid I'm
gonna do something stupid?

16:31.990 --> 16:32.908
{\an3}David...
Something crazy?

16:32.991 --> 16:33.909
What, something deranged?

16:33.992 --> 16:35.577
Oh, come on!

16:35.661 --> 16:36.870
Wha... Excuse me.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.081
{\an3}Excuse me.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.250
Wh-What's this?

16:41.333 --> 16:42.418
Uh,

16:42.501 --> 16:43.877
{\an3}it was there already.
No, no, no.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.087
I haven't seen this before.
Have you?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.881
I can't be positive,
but I don't think so.

16:47.965 --> 16:48.841
{\an1}VALET:
Sir, cars are checked

16:48.924 --> 16:50.968
before they're parked--
the scratch was there.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.553
Excuse me,
the lady said it wasn't.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.722
{\an5}Well, she's wrong.
DAVID:
This is her car.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.889
She drives this car every day.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.266
You're trying to tell me
she hasn't seen

16:57.349 --> 16:58.434
a scratch the size of Texas?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.561
{\an3}No, no, no, no,
no, you did this--

17:00.644 --> 17:01.770
you have to pay for it.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.771
David, please,

17:02.855 --> 17:04.565
I said I wasn't sure.

17:04.647 --> 17:06.108
Donna, either
you know or you don't.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.109
Then I guess I don't.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.905
It's just like a spy
to take the other side.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.031
I'm on your side.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.117
Keep acting this way,
and I'll be the only one who is.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.130
DICK:
So, I'll see you

17:28.213 --> 17:29.256
after class.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.924
{\an1}Yeah, I'll be
in the Condor's Nest.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.760
Oh, we'll talk
race strategy.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.470
(sighs):
Oh, yay.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.597
Oh. You should be home
shining up your tray.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.307
{\an3}I got two things
to say to you:

17:38.390 --> 17:39.975
serve from the left;
clear from the right.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.852
In your dreams.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.687
I think your boy's
getting nervous.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.439
Mm. Well, if this
is about the race,

17:45.522 --> 17:46.982
{\an1}I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.358
You nervous, too?

17:48.442 --> 17:49.818
No. Try bored.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.820
{\an3}The race, the bet,
the whole thing.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.782
{\an3}I don't know what it's gonna
take to convince you guys

17:54.865 --> 17:56.325
it doesn't impress me.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.659
You have convinced me.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.327
I have?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.787
Completely.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.538
Well, then what's
with all the preening?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
Well, at first
this race <i> was</i> about you.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.335
Now it's about setting out to do
something and doing it well.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.797
Mm. Sounds like you're
a regular Horatio Alger.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.465
Are you calling me a communist?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.008
That's Alger Hiss, Steve.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.176
Who?
Don't worry.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.677
Don't strain your brain.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.680
Look, Clare, I set out
to try and impress you,

18:18.764 --> 18:19.807
I admit it.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.683
But I ended up
impressing myself.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.185
Hmm.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.355
And this Horatio guy
is a Shakespeare character.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.773
Hamlet.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.317
I read the Cliff Notes
in ninth grade.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.319
I'm not a complete imbecile.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.531
(whistles)

18:37.449 --> 18:40.744
BRANDON:
Hey, Val, is that you?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.246
Waiting up for me?

18:42.329 --> 18:45.666
A little early for curfew.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.167
Just wanted to talk
to you, that's all.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.877
(sighs)

18:48.961 --> 18:50.921
Yeah.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.048
I thought you might.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.344
{\an3}So, how do you
want to do this?

18:57.427 --> 18:59.388
Well, you could believe me.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.848
You didn't come to me, did you?

19:02.516 --> 19:04.560
I know I didn't, Brandon.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.144
I was embarrassed.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.231
Embarrassed?

19:09.314 --> 19:11.525
Well, if you're
telling the truth...

19:11.608 --> 19:12.818
Well, of course
it was the truth.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.611
Then there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.737
{\an1}Really.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.698
I got pregnant by a married man

19:17.781 --> 19:19.700
who doesn't want
anything to do with me.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.159
That's pretty embarrassing,
don't you think?

19:21.243 --> 19:24.580
Look, Val, I'd like
to help you, but, uh...

19:24.663 --> 19:26.582
you got to tell me everything.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.167
If you know about the pregnancy
and the abortion,

19:29.251 --> 19:30.544
you do know everything.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.130
What?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.632
(sighs)

19:35.716 --> 19:38.093
I went to see
Kenny Bannerman today.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.804
{\an3}He told me
about a certain

19:40.888 --> 19:42.347
hundred thousand dollars

19:42.431 --> 19:44.683
that, uh, I think
you're pretty intimate with.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.059
(chuckles softly)

19:46.143 --> 19:47.436
He did?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.604
Yeah, he did.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.773
I thought you were
gonna tell me everything.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.943
Okay, so I didn't, okay?

19:55.027 --> 19:55.986
Sue me.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.779
This isn't about you, Brandon.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.656
You're right, Val,
this isn't about me.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.991
This is about you

20:01.074 --> 20:03.285
{\an3}and whether or not
I can trust you.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.620
How could you do it?

20:04.703 --> 20:05.871
He hurt me.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.957
When I needed him the most,
he wasn't there.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.836
Kelly said she thinks, uh,
you weren't even pregnant.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.588
Who cares what Kelly thinks?

20:14.671 --> 20:15.964
It's over.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.467
{\an3}You're right, Val,
it is over...

20:18.550 --> 20:19.176
except for the money.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.844
You got to give it back.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.095
You're crazy.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.639
<i>I'm</i> crazy?

20:23.722 --> 20:24.598
{\an3}<i>I'm</i> crazy?

20:24.681 --> 20:27.142
Have you ever heard
the word "extortion"?

20:27.225 --> 20:29.770
Huh? How about "fraud"?

20:29.853 --> 20:31.104
How about "blackmail"?

20:31.188 --> 20:32.981
You got to give the money back.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.107
Is that a threat?

20:34.191 --> 20:36.026
Only if you make it one.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.653
Brandon, this is ridiculous.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.529
You're right,
this is ridiculous.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.156
{\an3}Let me tell you how
this is gonna happen.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.658
You're either
gonna give that money back,

20:42.741 --> 20:45.953
or you're gonna find
a new place to live!

20:46.036 --> 20:47.829
Do you understand?

20:54.878 --> 20:55.796
KELLY:
<i>This is really good.</i>

20:55.879 --> 20:58.340
What-what is it?

20:58.423 --> 21:01.843
{\an3}It's an authentic
North African couscous.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.013
Hmm. Where'd you
learn to cook?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.723
{\an3}Casablanca.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.725
You're kidding me.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.978
{\an3}Really. It wasn't enough
for my grandfather

21:11.061 --> 21:13.522
{\an3}to own half the TV stations
in California.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.859
He had a calling to broadcast
<i>TJ Hooker</i> to the Third World.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.861
Hmm. When were you there?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.405
High school.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.365
{\an1}Mm, that must have
been amazing.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.825
Not really.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.452
It's kind hard to kiss
a girl through a veil.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.706
I never know
when you're kidding.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.043
Well, at least
I talk about myself.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.422
What do you want to know?

21:40.298 --> 21:42.217
I don't know, Kelly.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.261
{\an3}You know,
there's this...

21:44.344 --> 21:47.097
this part of you
that you keep closed up.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.142
It's better that way.
Is it?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.645
What could be so bad
that I wouldn't understand?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.399
I want to be close to you.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.609
I know.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.531
It's just hard talking about it.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.741
What?

22:07.784 --> 22:08.910
All right, I'll tell you.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.204
But if after I tell you,

22:11.288 --> 22:13.790
you just want to call it a day,
that's fine.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.000
All right, all right.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.376
Tell me you're an axe murderer.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.130
No. No.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.799
I used to have a drug problem.

22:22.883 --> 22:23.675
Cocaine.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.432
I got in way over my head
last year.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.767
Is that all?

22:31.850 --> 22:35.729
And I was in
a really bad relationship.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.231
One that had a lot to do
with my addiction.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.610
I feel so much better now.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.986
None of this bothers you?

22:43.070 --> 22:45.447
Well...

22:45.530 --> 22:47.449
I've had a few
nighttime cravings

22:47.532 --> 22:50.660
that I wouldn't want anybody
to know about either.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.287
You have?

22:52.370 --> 22:54.956
Found myself in the freezer,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.833
ice cream section,
with a big spoon.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.627
Chocolate?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.961
Rocky road.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.717
How do you expect me
to react to that?

23:08.845 --> 23:11.348
With a great deal of compassion.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.241
(doorbell chimes)

23:33.495 --> 23:34.371
Hi, Valerie.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.413
Is Brandon home?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.624
{\an1}Um, no, but you can
come in and wait if you want.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.708
Thanks.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.047
Nice place.
You like it?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.299
{\an3}I hear there's
a room available.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.343
You're, uh, moving out?

23:48.426 --> 23:50.011
Yeah.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.304
How come?

23:51.388 --> 23:53.390
Creative differences.

23:53.473 --> 23:57.561
Valerie, um, I know this
isn't any of my business,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.354
{\an1}and if you want
to tell me to shut up,

23:59.437 --> 24:01.398
I'll totally understand.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.359
But I kind of know a little
of what's going on with you.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.027
Brandon told you?

24:06.111 --> 24:08.029
I just put two and two together.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.532
Brandon's got a big mouth.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.159
Actually, Brandon's
probably one of

24:12.242 --> 24:13.410
the most discreet people I know.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.495
Well, I'm glad you think so.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.040
{\an3}Look, I got a lot to do,
you know?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.041
I haven't known him

24:20.125 --> 24:22.127
{\an1}as long as you have,
but I know him well enough

24:22.210 --> 24:24.754
to know that he'd understand if
you'd just tell him the truth.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.507
I did tell him the truth.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.884
And now he wants me to be

24:28.967 --> 24:30.552
a little more virtuous
than I can afford.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.222
Well, maybe your virtue is worth
a lot more than you think.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.559
Well, that's my decision,
not Brandon's.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.355
Listen, I-I didn't
mean to interfere.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.274
{\an1}I just wanted
to drop off these tapes.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.495
(doorbell chimes)

25:01.333 --> 25:02.709
The hell are you doing here?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.878
It'll only take a minute.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.971
My wife's upstairs,
so clock's ticking.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.432
{\an3}Look, I know
you talked to Brandon.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.309
And I'll tell you
what I told him:

25:19.392 --> 25:21.770
That hundred grand was worth
getting you out of my life.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.775
(sighs):
Here.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.944
{\an3}What is this?
It's the money.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.404
{\an3}I shouldn't have taken it
in the first place.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.573
I don't want this.
Just take it, okay?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.659
{\an3}I promise, I'll stay
out of your life forever.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.285
What's gotten into you?

25:37.369 --> 25:38.286
Suddenly got religion?

25:38.370 --> 25:41.289
{\an3}It's a cheap price
to pay for peace of mind.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.292
{\an1}That's funny,
that's what I was thinking.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.338
{\an1}Dad, you promised
we'd play.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.423
{\an1}I'll be inside in a minute,
sweetheart, okay?

25:50.507 --> 25:53.218
Who are you?

25:53.301 --> 25:56.972
I'm, uh, I'm an acquaintance
of your dad's.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.598
What's an acquaintance?

25:58.682 --> 26:01.309
{\an3}Someone you don't know
very well.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.312
Are we through here?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.398
Completely.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.319
Come on, big guy,
let's go.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.613
Come on, come on, come on.

26:15.865 --> 26:16.825
(knocking)

26:16.908 --> 26:17.867
DAVID:
Donna.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.369
(knocking)

26:19.452 --> 26:20.829
Donna.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.247
(knocking)

26:22.330 --> 26:23.623
Hey.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.709
(knocking)

26:29.963 --> 26:31.006
Hey.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.174
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this,

26:33.258 --> 26:35.176
but what are you doing
out here in your underwear?

26:35.260 --> 26:36.720
Oh.
(chuckles)

26:36.803 --> 26:37.971
I just went for a swim.

26:38.054 --> 26:38.972
{\an3}What?!

26:39.055 --> 26:40.557
Are you nuts? In November?

26:40.640 --> 26:42.183
It's, like, 50 degrees
in that water.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.059
Yeah.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.145
Uh, look, I-I forgot
to bring a towel.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.855
I should let
you freeze.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.065
Oh, by the way, I talked to
my mechanic, and, uh, he said

26:49.149 --> 26:51.192
he could have the dent
repaired in your car in a day.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.027
Thanks, but I'll take care
of it myself.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.403
{\an1}Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry about it.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.863
I already got a loaner.
You'll love it.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.990
It's a Porsche Cabriolet.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.036
{\an1}You know, David,
I know this is not

27:01.119 --> 27:03.038
{\an1}what you want
to hear right now,

27:03.121 --> 27:04.664
{\an1}but I'm really
worried about you.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.707
I think you need help.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.708
(chuckles)

27:06.791 --> 27:07.751
Is this my father talking?

27:07.834 --> 27:09.544
No.

27:09.627 --> 27:10.545
You're scaring me.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.047
Why? What's so scary?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.882
I don't know.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.551
People who go swimming
in the middle of winter,

27:16.634 --> 27:18.678
go swimming in the middle
of the night by themselves.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.097
Hey, have you heard about
that new club on Sunset?

27:21.181 --> 27:23.600
Lines all the way
around the corner, but I heard

27:23.683 --> 27:25.352
{\an3}Ben Franklin's got some pull,
so we should be okay.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.729
Please, please,
don't go anywhere.

27:29.647 --> 27:30.565
Uh, thanks for the towel.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.067
You sure you don't want to come?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.068
Stay the night.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.361
You can sleep on the couch.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.362
I can't.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.446
I got to go.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.198
I'll see you later.

27:57.801 --> 27:58.760
Hey.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.553
What are you doing here?

28:00.637 --> 28:02.639
{\an3}Just a little
mental preparation.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.933
Psych myself up.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.101
What about you?

28:06.184 --> 28:09.145
Oh, I just went for a walk.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.147
Been coming down here
a lot lately at night.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.900
{\an3}You know, it's
interesting, Clare,

28:13.983 --> 28:16.569
{\an3}these shells are only a
sixteenth of an inch thick,

28:16.653 --> 28:20.031
made out of Kevlar.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.116
{\an3}Same stuff as
bulletproof vests.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.117
Hmm.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.368
You've done your homework.

28:23.451 --> 28:26.079
(knocks on boat)

28:26.162 --> 28:27.831
Kind of wish my heart
was wrapped in Kevlar.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.125
Well, you wouldn't need
a bulletproof vest

28:30.208 --> 28:32.919
around your heart if you used
your head once in a while.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.087
(chuckles)

28:34.170 --> 28:35.839
I knew you were gonna say that.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.173
Good night, Clare.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.176
Steve, wait.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.304
What?

28:43.388 --> 28:46.516
I'm really impressed
with what you've done.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.646
I just wish
you'd done it sooner.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.481
(sighs)

28:53.565 --> 28:54.983
You know, I've decided
to stop hurting

28:55.066 --> 28:56.234
and start healing, Clare.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.988
So I've turned a corner on this.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.865
I feel pretty good
about myself, too.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.077
Good-bye.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.083
(door opens, then closes)

29:22.886 --> 29:24.721
Still here, huh?

29:24.804 --> 29:26.347
Don't rub it in.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.724
I thought I was
pretty specific, Val.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.851
I got the message, Brandon.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.186
So what'd you do about it?

29:31.269 --> 29:33.313
I did what you told me.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.439
I gave the money back.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.982
Good.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.735
For who?

29:38.818 --> 29:40.487
Not for me.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.030
My club's on the verge
of bankruptcy.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.865
Better your club than your soul.

29:43.948 --> 29:44.782
You know what, Brandon?

29:44.866 --> 29:46.826
I'm sick and tired
of you preaching to me.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.369
Okay.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.038
(sighs softly)

29:50.121 --> 29:51.539
So are you staying?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.500
Why?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.627
Is there some other
test I have to pass?

29:55.710 --> 29:57.837
Want me to sign a loyalty oath
or random drug testing?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.839
Loyalty oath might be nice.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.841
When have I not
been loyal to you?

30:01.925 --> 30:03.927
Okay.

30:06.012 --> 30:09.224
{\an3}I want you to answer
me one question.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.351
Were you really pregnant?

30:12.810 --> 30:13.853
(sighs)

30:15.146 --> 30:16.147
No.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.486
I lied about the baby
and the abortion.

30:24.822 --> 30:26.407
Don't hate me Brandon, okay?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.576
I don't hate you, Valerie,
but sometimes you make it

30:28.660 --> 30:30.411
very difficult for me
to like you.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.246
He led me on.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.540
He told me he was
getting a divorce.

30:33.623 --> 30:36.251
I fell in love with him.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.252
I thought he could save me.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.587
No one can save you like that;
you know better.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.882
I wanted to believe in him.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.008
He reminded me of my father.

30:44.092 --> 30:48.137
And when he deserted me,
I just, I couldn't take it.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.931
So then you decided to take him.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.599
Yeah, I guess so.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.393
You know, I-I'm sorry.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.520
I'm sorry that I can't
live up to your values.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.313
I-I thought I could,
but I can't.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.815
{\an1}I'm not like you,
Brandon.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.150
(sighs softly)

31:01.234 --> 31:02.944
Val, it's okay.

31:03.027 --> 31:03.987
You did the right thing.

31:04.070 --> 31:04.862
You made amends.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.615
Well, it didn't
make me feel that good.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.950
Just want to let you know that.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.452
You know, Val...

31:11.536 --> 31:13.705
(sighs softly)

31:13.788 --> 31:15.790
you got to straighten yourself
out or you're gonna get yourself

31:15.873 --> 31:18.418
in trouble so deep that no one's
gonna be able to get you out.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.502
You hear what I'm saying?

31:21.546 --> 31:22.463
Yeah, I hear you.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.632
Good.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.092
{\an3}'Cause this advice
cost you a lot.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.595
Don't remind me.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.768
(chanting):
BGB row! BGB row!

31:35.852 --> 31:37.812
Yeah!
Hey! Whoo!

31:37.895 --> 31:38.980
Hey, good luck.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.148
You losers are
gonna need it.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.482
(laughs)
Thanks a lot.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.359
All you guys, good luck.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.485
What's that supposed to mean?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.486
I don't know, Dick.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.988
I think it means good luck.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.948
And on another note,

31:49.032 --> 31:51.367
{\an1}I hope you and Clare
can make each other happy.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.952
{\an3}And what's that
supposed to mean?

31:53.036 --> 31:56.122
Boy, talking to you
is a real waste of time.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.375
(Clare sighs)

31:59.459 --> 32:01.002
I didn't think I was
gonna be so nervous.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.712
{\an1}Well, you want
some words of wisdom?

32:02.795 --> 32:03.504
{\an3}Yeah.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.006
{\an1}Don't make such
a big deal about it.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.257
It's just a race.

32:06.341 --> 32:10.345
Tell your friend over there that
I'm not deep enough for subtext.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.013
Listen, Clare, we're ready.
Let's go.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.098
{\an3}Okay.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.060
{\an3}Bye.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.356
{\an1}Good shape,
you guys.

32:21.439 --> 32:24.359
{\an1}Donna, calling Mel
was the right thing to do.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.360
I don't know.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.028
{\an3}I feel like
maybe I am a spy.

32:27.111 --> 32:31.491
Well, he needs to know just
how weird David's been acting.

32:31.574 --> 32:32.867
What exactly did he say?

32:32.950 --> 32:34.661
Well, what could he say?

32:34.744 --> 32:36.037
He's scared, just like me.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.539
So you don't think
it's just the money?

32:38.623 --> 32:40.041
Well, I thought
that at first.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.753
{\an3}But David's been
acting so extreme,

32:43.836 --> 32:45.922
like he's manic.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.757
Who isn't sometimes?

32:47.840 --> 32:48.883
{\an3}I know.

32:48.966 --> 32:51.386
But then I think
about his mother.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.721
She's manic-depressive.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.556
And that can
be inherited.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.184
Well, maybe David should
see a doctor.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.227
{\an3}Yeah, I think
he should.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.895
But what if he won't go?

33:00.978 --> 33:02.855
RACE ANNOUNCER (over bullhorn):
Attention, coxswain,

33:02.939 --> 33:05.400
bring your shells to the line.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.361
Kegger boat, ready?

33:08.444 --> 33:10.071
BGB boat, ready?

33:10.154 --> 33:12.073
(gunshot)

33:12.156 --> 33:13.783
(crowd cheering)

33:15.451 --> 33:18.371
{\an1}Pull harder
through the water, guys!

33:18.454 --> 33:22.875
{\an1}Stay together!
Power stroke! One...

33:22.959 --> 33:25.586
CLARE:
Drive those legs down!

33:25.670 --> 33:27.922
Eight...

33:28.005 --> 33:29.757
nine...

33:29.841 --> 33:31.175
ten!

33:32.844 --> 33:37.598
One, two, three!

33:39.976 --> 33:44.439
Five, six...!

33:47.066 --> 33:51.404
CLARE:
...six, seven, eight.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.739
Who do we root for?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.949
{\an3}Well, what are
the odds of a tie?

33:55.032 --> 33:58.619
About as good as a chance
as KEG has of winning this race.

34:00.705 --> 34:05.626
{\an1}Pull! Pull! Pull through
the water! We got 'em!

34:05.710 --> 34:08.755
CLARE:
Strike water! Pull!

34:08.838 --> 34:15.636
15 strokes hard! One, two,
three! Legs down! Five!

34:15.719 --> 34:19.014
...nine, ten.

34:19.098 --> 34:23.811
One, two, three...!

34:23.895 --> 34:25.646
(cheering)

34:25.730 --> 34:26.813
{\an3}Come on!

34:26.898 --> 34:28.440
{\an3}You know, I still
can't believe

34:28.524 --> 34:30.275
Steve got so into this.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.652
{\an1}Yeah, he is
really holding his own.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.031
{\an1}Wow, they're
practically even.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.699
All right, let's pull!

34:39.911 --> 34:43.039
One, two...!

34:43.121 --> 34:46.833
CLARE:
Oars in the water! Deep pull!

34:46.918 --> 34:49.003
Last 20! Two...

34:49.085 --> 34:56.636
...seven, eight, nine, ten!

34:56.719 --> 34:57.553
One...

34:57.637 --> 35:00.139
I'm impressed. Steve
can really row, look.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.184
Oh!

35:03.267 --> 35:04.560
Clare's not bad, either.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.521
...14, 15...

35:06.604 --> 35:08.689
{\an3}Power stroke for
the last 20, guys!

35:08.773 --> 35:15.196
...18, 19, 20.

35:15.279 --> 35:21.285
...four, five, six, seven...

35:21.369 --> 35:23.955
(cheering)

35:29.126 --> 35:33.840
{\an4}CLARE:
Push it! Push it!
That's it! Push ahead!

35:39.554 --> 35:41.514
Yeah! Whoo!

35:41.597 --> 35:42.557
Whoo!

35:42.640 --> 35:45.309
Dang!

35:45.393 --> 35:46.894
(all cheering)

35:46.978 --> 35:48.521
That was so great!

35:54.485 --> 35:56.112
Oh, Steve.

35:56.195 --> 35:57.238
{\an3}Clare!

35:57.321 --> 35:58.406
(laughs)

35:58.489 --> 36:00.283
That was so intense.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.034
Uh! You did great.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.578
{\an1}No, you did all
the work.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.495
You were amazing.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.038
Thanks.
(chuckles)

36:12.962 --> 36:16.215
Don't worry about it, guys.
We gave it our best shot.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.551
Nothing to be ashamed of.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.558
(team laughing)

36:30.187 --> 36:31.606
Congratulations.

36:31.689 --> 36:32.899
It was so close.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.609
And yet so far.
(chuckles)

36:34.692 --> 36:36.861
So, what time's dinner?

36:38.195 --> 36:39.780
{\an1}Guys, you're not seriously
gonna do this, are you?

36:39.864 --> 36:40.823
Yeah, a bet's a bet.

36:40.907 --> 36:41.949
6:30 okay?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.327
Life is good.
(chuckles)

36:44.410 --> 36:46.954
Clare, we can't start
the celebration without you.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.331
Okay, one sec,
I'll be there.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.833
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
(chuckles)

36:52.376 --> 36:55.463
Go ahead, gloat,
you earned it.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.964
You did really well.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.090
Eh...

36:58.174 --> 37:00.259
{\an1}Oh, come on. You lost
by, like, an inch.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.594
I'm proud of you.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.138
I haven't felt that way
in a really long time.

37:04.221 --> 37:06.474
{\an1}DICK:
Clare!

37:06.557 --> 37:09.268
Clare, come on.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.436
You'd better go.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.313
Okay. Bye.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.398
All right, yeah!

37:14.482 --> 37:17.818
The Clarester!

37:17.902 --> 37:19.445
{\an4}DICK:
Hey, what can we say?
You led us to victory.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.738
Well, all I did was yell.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.657
{\an1}Oh, no, no, you pushed us
to our painful best,

37:22.740 --> 37:24.033
and in fine crew tradition,

37:24.116 --> 37:25.660
we want to honor
your contribution

37:25.743 --> 37:28.162
{\an1}with a little ceremonial
revenge. Guys?

37:28.245 --> 37:29.497
What're you talking about?

37:29.580 --> 37:33.501
No! No! No... guys!

37:33.584 --> 37:36.837
{\an1}ALL:
One, two...

37:36.921 --> 37:37.838
Here we go!

37:37.922 --> 37:39.632
{\an1}three!
(yelling)

37:40.883 --> 37:41.842
(all cheering)

37:41.926 --> 37:44.845
(spluttering)

38:05.366 --> 38:07.201
(knocking)

38:10.579 --> 38:11.539
{\an1}Hi.

38:11.622 --> 38:12.873
Hi. What's up?

38:12.957 --> 38:15.042
{\an1}Nothing.
I just came by

38:15.126 --> 38:16.752
{\an1}to say thank you
for your help.

38:16.836 --> 38:17.878
I asked for your advice,

38:17.962 --> 38:18.754
and I got your help.

38:18.838 --> 38:19.922
What're you talking about?

38:20.006 --> 38:21.549
Val said you talked to her.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.926
Oh, yeah. Was I out of line?

38:24.010 --> 38:26.721
{\an1}No, no, no, everything
worked out for the best.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.015
{\an3}I'm glad. Valerie's lucky
to have such a good friend.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.057
Yeah, so am I.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.559
You want to get something
to eat?

38:31.642 --> 38:34.270
{\an3}Yeah, sure.
Just let me get my keys.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.317
Okay.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.069
{\an1}Don't forget
those D-cells.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.738
(laughs)
Shut up.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.993
(ringing)

38:52.371 --> 38:53.372
Hello?

38:53.456 --> 38:54.749
(receiver clicks, dial tone)

38:54.832 --> 38:56.292
Hello?

38:59.795 --> 39:01.756
(phone rings)

39:01.839 --> 39:02.840
Hello?

39:02.923 --> 39:03.924
Hey.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.384
Was that you who called?

39:05.468 --> 39:06.719
Three rings.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.429
I guess you're ready to tell me

39:08.512 --> 39:09.764
what that means now.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.933
It means that I'm falling
in love with you.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.935
Mark...

39:15.019 --> 39:17.104
Or that I've fallen
and I can't get up.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.856
Sometimes I get them confused,
you know?

39:18.939 --> 39:20.357
(chuckles)

39:20.441 --> 39:21.734
See you tomorrow?

39:21.817 --> 39:23.110
Yes, you will.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.695
Good.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.203
(car door opens, then shuts)

39:34.705 --> 39:36.957
(doorbell chimes)

39:47.885 --> 39:49.053
Hi.

39:49.136 --> 39:50.805
Hi.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.807
I didn't see you at the dinner.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.644
Well, I begged Dick
not to go through with it.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.730
Was it really awful?

39:59.814 --> 40:02.608
It was the only seven-course
meal in fraternity history.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.486
You must be tired, huh?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.488
A little.
You want to come in?

40:07.571 --> 40:08.781
Yeah.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.284
What are you doing?

40:12.368 --> 40:13.828
{\an1}Just doing
a little reading.

40:13.911 --> 40:18.332
{\an3}You have changed.
What book?

40:18.415 --> 40:19.333
You're gonna laugh.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.459
No, I won't.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.460
It's by Horatio Alger.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.461
It's a rags-to-riches story:

40:22.545 --> 40:26.173
hard work and sincerity triumph
over adversity.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.508
You enjoying it?

40:27.591 --> 40:28.676
Immensely.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.468
Hmm.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.971
Everything but the title,
anyway.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.097
<i>Ragged Dick.</i>

40:33.180 --> 40:34.515
{\an1}(laughs)

40:34.598 --> 40:36.475
Kind of funny, huh?

40:36.559 --> 40:39.478
You know, I don't think I ever
want to hear that name again.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.938
What's that supposed to mean?

40:43.774 --> 40:44.692
Are you saying...

40:44.775 --> 40:48.154
Yeah, I'm saying.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.074
I love you so much, Clare.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.411
I really missed you.

40:55.494 --> 40:58.080
I love you, too.

41:02.585 --> 41:05.296
Shut up and bite me.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.590
(growls)

41:09.466 --> 41:11.802
{\an1}(giggles)

41:30.154 --> 41:31.572
Hey.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.115
Didn't your mom

41:33.199 --> 41:35.201
ever tell you the one
about all work and no play?

41:35.284 --> 41:38.746
Yeah, but she left out the part
about going broke.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.750
{\an3}Ah. So I guess
it'd be in bad taste

41:42.833 --> 41:44.877
{\an3}to invite you
to this hot new club?

41:46.212 --> 41:48.297
Sorry.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.549
You know without money,

41:50.633 --> 41:54.094
I'm not gonna be able to get
this club back on its feet.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.888
And with it?

41:55.971 --> 41:57.932
That doesn't matter, I mean,
'cause I don't have it.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.600
I did.
But I don't have it anymore.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.769
What happened?
You were robbed?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.604
No. I had an attack of ethics.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.273
Happens to the worst of us.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.400
Hmm.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.155
You know, I always wondered what
it'd be like owning this place.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.241
David, like a bleeding ulcer.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.661
Would cash make
the bleeding stop?

42:22.539 --> 42:26.794
David, why did you come here?

42:26.877 --> 42:28.587
{\an3}(chuckles)

42:28.671 --> 42:32.424
Well, originally to find a dance
partner for the evening.

42:32.508 --> 42:37.304
But it seems like there might be
more of a long-term arrangement.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.847
Like what?

42:38.931 --> 42:42.518
{\an3}I think I might have
a solution to your problem.

42:42.601 --> 42:46.146
What, are you serious?

42:46.230 --> 42:48.148
You mean like a loan
or something?

42:48.232 --> 42:49.984
(chuckles) No.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.821
More like buying half interest
in the club.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.115
You have that kind of money?

42:56.198 --> 42:58.450
{\an3}And more.

42:59.868 --> 43:03.539
So, what do you say?

43:06.458 --> 43:08.502
I say we have a deal.

43:08.585 --> 43:13.132
(both chuckle)
