02:55.310 --> 02:58.177
All right, what's it going to be?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.778
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.

03:00.987 --> 03:03.449
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.847
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!

03:07.054 --> 03:09.351
- Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

03:09.555 --> 03:11.989
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.190
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?

03:15.394 --> 03:17.384
Do you ask a fish how it swims?

03:17.662 --> 03:19.789
Or a bird how it flies?

03:19.998 --> 03:21.022
No, you don't.

03:21.233 --> 03:22.962
They were born to do it.

03:23.168 --> 03:26.000
Just like Willy Wonka was born
to be a candy man...

03:26.837 --> 03:28.896
...and you were born to be a Wonkerer.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.366
Who can take the sunrise

03:32.576 --> 03:35.237
Sprinkle it with dew

03:36.246 --> 03:39.807
Cover it in chocolate
and a miracle or two

03:40.016 --> 03:41.677
The Candy Man!

03:43.085 --> 03:45.019
The Candy Man can

03:46.588 --> 03:49.489
'Cause he mixes it with love

03:49.691 --> 03:52.090
And makes the world taste good

03:53.694 --> 03:56.891
Who can take a rainbow

03:57.098 --> 03:59.032
Wrap it in a sigh

04:00.533 --> 04:04.162
Soak it in the sun
And make the strawberry-lemon pie

04:04.371 --> 04:05.668
The Candy Man?

04:05.872 --> 04:07.533
The Candy Man!

04:08.441 --> 04:10.271
The Candy Man can!

04:11.110 --> 04:15.103
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world...

04:15.881 --> 04:17.541
...taste good

04:18.216 --> 04:19.683
Willy Wonka makes

04:19.884 --> 04:21.408
Everything he bakes

04:21.619 --> 04:25.020
Satisfying and delicious

04:25.223 --> 04:28.089
Talk about your childhood wishes

04:28.292 --> 04:31.784
You can even eat the dishes

04:42.405 --> 04:44.429
Who can take tomorrow

04:44.639 --> 04:46.800
Dip it in a dream

04:47.409 --> 04:50.640
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream

04:50.912 --> 04:53.937
- The Candy Man
- Willy Wonka can

04:54.148 --> 04:56.810
The Candy Man can

04:58.085 --> 05:02.111
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love

05:02.322 --> 05:06.019
And makes the world taste good

05:07.827 --> 05:09.623
And the world tastes good

05:10.996 --> 05:15.933
'Cause the Candy Man thinks it should

05:35.684 --> 05:36.742
Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

05:37.186 --> 05:39.848
Come along, Charlie.
You're late.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.416
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

05:43.624 --> 05:44.716
You're right.

05:45.526 --> 05:47.858
- There you are.
- Thanks.

05:48.629 --> 05:50.620
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.

06:33.903 --> 06:36.029
Up the airy mountain...

06:36.238 --> 06:38.468
...down the rushing glen.

06:38.673 --> 06:40.834
We dare not go a-hunting...

06:41.043 --> 06:41.907
...for fear...

06:42.110 --> 06:44.077
...of little men.

06:44.345 --> 06:45.903
You see...

06:46.914 --> 06:48.677
...nobody ever goes in...

06:52.352 --> 06:54.411
...nobody ever comes out.

07:04.863 --> 07:06.330
Charlie's late.

07:06.532 --> 07:09.228
He works too hard for a little boy.

07:09.435 --> 07:11.561
He should have some time to play.

07:11.769 --> 07:13.737
Not enough hours in the day.

07:13.938 --> 07:16.168
With you four bedridden for 20 years...

07:16.374 --> 07:19.240
...it takes work
to keep this family going.

07:19.443 --> 07:21.741
If only his father were alive.

07:21.945 --> 07:25.574
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.

07:25.782 --> 07:28.944
In all the years
you've been saying that...

07:29.385 --> 07:32.218
...I've yet to see you
set foot on the floor.

07:33.389 --> 07:36.050
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...

07:37.225 --> 07:38.692
Hi, everybody!

07:39.461 --> 07:42.123
Wake up, Charlie's home!

07:43.398 --> 07:44.694
Grandpa George.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.061
Grandma Georgina.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.926
Grandma Josephine.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.135
Grandpa Joe!

07:55.741 --> 07:57.641
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

07:57.910 --> 07:59.707
It's yours, too.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.607
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

08:02.814 --> 08:03.940
It's all we have!

08:04.149 --> 08:05.810
What are you saying?

08:07.152 --> 08:09.382
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?

08:09.588 --> 08:12.715
What difference
does it make where? He got it.

08:13.257 --> 08:14.451
My first payday.

08:14.658 --> 08:17.456
Good for you.
We'll have a real banquet.

08:17.661 --> 08:18.820
Mom?

08:19.162 --> 08:22.154
Here's what's left.
You keep it.

08:22.832 --> 08:24.459
Except for this.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.328
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.969
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.

08:32.808 --> 08:34.605
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

08:34.943 --> 08:38.308
When bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right to tobacco.

08:38.513 --> 08:40.275
Go on, Grandpa.

08:40.681 --> 08:42.672
Please take it.

08:49.189 --> 08:52.818
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.289
There was this strange man there.

08:56.128 --> 08:57.823
I think he was a tinker.

08:58.030 --> 09:01.431
He was standing behind me
looking up at the factory.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.760
Just before he left he said...

09:03.968 --> 09:07.267
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out. "

09:07.472 --> 09:09.497
And right he was, Charlie!

09:09.707 --> 09:12.334
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.

09:12.543 --> 09:13.635
Why did he?

09:13.877 --> 09:17.176
Because all the other chocolate makers
were sending spies...

09:17.381 --> 09:20.838
...dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

09:21.050 --> 09:24.986
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst!

09:25.555 --> 09:28.182
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!"

09:28.390 --> 09:32.292
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

09:32.494 --> 09:36.054
He locked the gates
and vanished completely.

09:36.330 --> 09:39.197
And then, suddenly,
about three years later...

09:39.400 --> 09:41.960
...the most amazing thing happened.

09:42.169 --> 09:44.796
The factory started again,
full blast!

09:45.004 --> 09:48.371
And more delicious candies
were coming out than ever.

09:48.575 --> 09:51.703
But the gates stayed locked.
So that no one...

09:51.911 --> 09:54.640
...not even Slugworth,
could steal them.

09:54.846 --> 09:58.873
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.

09:59.084 --> 10:00.881
Thousands must be.

10:01.086 --> 10:02.052
But who?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.914
Who are they?

10:04.422 --> 10:07.516
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

10:09.660 --> 10:11.889
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

10:12.095 --> 10:14.256
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.331
We have nitric acid, glycerin...

10:19.535 --> 10:21.662
...and a special mixture of my own.

10:21.870 --> 10:24.668
Together it's dangerous stuff,
blows you up.

10:24.873 --> 10:28.899
But mixed together right,
as only I know how, what's it make?

10:29.110 --> 10:30.509
- I don't know.
- Of course not!

10:30.712 --> 10:32.179
Because only I know.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.907
If you knew, you'd be teaching me
instead of me teaching you.

10:36.117 --> 10:40.678
And for a student to teach his teacher
is presumptuous. Is that clear?

10:40.887 --> 10:42.184
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

10:42.389 --> 10:46.757
Mixed together in the right way,
these dangerous ingredients...

10:46.959 --> 10:49.189
...make the finest wart remover.

10:49.528 --> 10:52.190
The trick is to pour equal amounts.

10:52.431 --> 10:55.661
Charlie, you take
the nitric acid and glycerin...

10:55.867 --> 10:58.734
...and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?

10:58.937 --> 11:01.098
Good lad. Pour.

11:03.274 --> 11:04.673
Did we do it wrong?

11:04.875 --> 11:07.605
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.

11:08.445 --> 11:10.436
What's going on out there?

11:12.949 --> 11:15.247
Come here! What's happening?

11:15.451 --> 11:17.783
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!

11:18.054 --> 11:19.180
Are you sure?

11:19.389 --> 11:21.515
He's giving lots of chocolate away!

11:21.723 --> 11:23.884
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!

11:24.893 --> 11:26.588
Class un-dismissed.

11:26.795 --> 11:29.695
He hid 5 Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.298
- Where'd he hide them?
- Inside 5 Wonka Bars, you must buy them.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.898
Class re-dismissed!

11:47.146 --> 11:49.205
Now, details of the announcement...

11:49.415 --> 11:51.940
...that has captured
the world's attention.

11:52.151 --> 11:54.778
Hidden among the billions
of Wonka Bars...

11:54.986 --> 11:56.886
...are 5 Gold Tickets.

11:57.088 --> 12:01.457
And to the 5 people who find them
will come the most fabulous prize.

12:01.659 --> 12:03.956
A lifetime supply of chocolate.

12:04.161 --> 12:07.892
If this were not enough, each winner,
before receiving his prize...

12:08.098 --> 12:09.895
...will be personally escorted...

12:10.100 --> 12:11.464
They're all crazy!

12:11.667 --> 12:12.964
The man's a genius!

12:13.169 --> 12:14.830
He'll sell a million bars.

12:16.005 --> 12:18.633
Do you think I've got a chance
to find one?

12:18.841 --> 12:21.502
One?! I'm counting on you
to find all five!

12:21.776 --> 12:23.073
One's enough for me.

12:23.278 --> 12:24.472
We have reports...

12:24.679 --> 12:27.307
...the response is phenomenal!
Wonka Bars...

12:27.515 --> 12:29.311
...are disappearing...

12:29.516 --> 12:31.746
...at a rate to boggle the mind.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.419
It is incredible...

12:33.620 --> 12:36.418
...the way Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.149
While the world searches,
we watch and wait, wondering...

12:40.360 --> 12:43.989
...where it will lead,
and how long the spirit will hold up...

12:44.197 --> 12:45.255
...under the strain.

12:45.465 --> 12:49.594
I still have these dreams, Doctor,
And I still can't stop believing them.

12:49.801 --> 12:51.666
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder...

12:51.870 --> 12:54.667
...to believe in dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

12:54.872 --> 12:57.705
The sooner you accept this,
the sooner you'll get well.

12:58.309 --> 13:02.972
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into
my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.345
What did he say?

13:05.548 --> 13:08.676
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.

13:08.885 --> 13:11.978
- You said...
- Shut up and tell me where's the ticket!

13:12.321 --> 13:14.289
We begin with 5 Golden Tickets.

13:14.490 --> 13:19.120
Like 5 lucky bolts of lightning
ready to strike at any point on the map.

13:19.328 --> 13:22.194
No one knew where or when
the first one would hit.

13:22.397 --> 13:24.865
But last night we got our answer.

13:25.066 --> 13:28.365
While America slept,
the first Golden Ticket was found...

13:28.569 --> 13:31.628
...in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

13:31.838 --> 13:36.332
We've been waiting for the story,
and we're ready with a live report.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.876
Proud we are,
for the attention of the world...

13:40.079 --> 13:42.206
...focuses today here in Duselheim.

13:42.415 --> 13:44.883
A community thrust into prominence...

13:45.084 --> 13:48.712
...by the discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.889
Its finder is the son
of a prominent butcher.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.785
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!

13:56.427 --> 14:00.056
The pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany.

14:00.264 --> 14:03.062
An example for the whole world.

14:03.266 --> 14:06.235
How does it feel to be
the first Golden Ticket finder?

14:06.436 --> 14:08.063
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

14:08.271 --> 14:11.263
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.

14:11.707 --> 14:13.867
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...

14:14.543 --> 14:18.001
Mrs. Gloop, would you say
a few words to the audience?

14:18.213 --> 14:22.080
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.

14:22.283 --> 14:25.946
He wouldn't do it unless
he needed the nourishment.

14:28.889 --> 14:30.947
Happy birthday, Charlie!

14:32.959 --> 14:34.256
Here you are, Charlie.

14:34.461 --> 14:35.894
Thank you.

14:42.634 --> 14:43.601
It's terrific!

14:43.802 --> 14:47.032
We each knitted, Grandmas
Georgina, Josephine and me.

14:47.238 --> 14:49.763
I did the end pieces with the tassels.

14:49.974 --> 14:53.273
And here's a little gift
from Grandpa George and me.

14:53.478 --> 14:55.809
I think I know what this is.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.441
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.946
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.584
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.784
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.217
Stop it!

15:08.424 --> 15:11.791
- I've got the same chance as anybody!
- You've got more.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.483
You want it more.

15:13.761 --> 15:15.126
Go on, open it!

15:15.330 --> 15:16.922
Here goes!

15:19.767 --> 15:21.165
- I got it!
- Where?

15:21.602 --> 15:22.591
Let's see!

15:22.936 --> 15:24.767
Fooled you, didn't I?

15:25.005 --> 15:26.939
You thought I really had it.

15:28.442 --> 15:30.409
Never mind, Charlie.

15:30.610 --> 15:32.168
You'll find one.

15:32.945 --> 15:35.937
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!

15:48.092 --> 15:50.890
I wanted to find the first
Golden ticket, Daddy!

15:51.095 --> 15:54.292
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.

15:54.498 --> 15:57.227
I've got every girl on staff
hunting for you.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.628
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?

15:59.836 --> 16:02.999
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!

16:03.439 --> 16:04.462
Give me time!

16:04.673 --> 16:07.801
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?

16:08.010 --> 16:11.468
For five days now,
the entire factory's been on the job!

16:11.680 --> 16:14.409
They haven't shelled a peanut
since Monday!

16:14.615 --> 16:18.107
They've been shelling
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!

16:18.319 --> 16:19.650
Work nights!

16:21.655 --> 16:23.452
Come along, you girls!

16:23.657 --> 16:26.490
Put a jerk in it,
or you'll be out on your ears!

16:26.760 --> 16:28.455
And listen: The first girl...

16:28.662 --> 16:33.121
...that finds a Golden Ticket
gets a bonus in their pay packet!

16:33.332 --> 16:34.993
What do you think of that?!

16:37.102 --> 16:38.568
They're not even trying!

16:38.770 --> 16:41.102
They don't want to find it!

16:41.339 --> 16:43.500
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.

16:43.775 --> 16:46.073
19,000 bars an hour they're shelling!

16:46.277 --> 16:48.642
760,000 they've done so far!

16:48.845 --> 16:49.903
You promised!

16:50.113 --> 16:52.741
You promised I'd have it the first day!

16:52.950 --> 16:56.817
You're going to be very unpopular
if you don't deliver soon.

16:57.053 --> 17:00.318
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.

17:00.523 --> 17:02.081
I won't talk to you!

17:02.291 --> 17:05.589
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!

17:05.794 --> 17:07.590
I won't go to school!

17:07.796 --> 17:10.356
Veruca! Sweetheart! Angel!

17:10.699 --> 17:13.326
There are only 4 tickets
left in the world...

17:13.534 --> 17:16.162
...and the whole world's
hunting for them!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.200
What can I do?

17:18.472 --> 17:20.702
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!

17:22.709 --> 17:25.644
About time, too! I want it!

17:30.549 --> 17:33.518
Give me my ticket! It's mine!

17:33.719 --> 17:36.210
I found the Golden Ticket!

17:41.892 --> 17:42.950
Thank God!

17:43.160 --> 17:46.288
Happiness is what counts with children.

17:46.497 --> 17:48.555
Happiness and harmony.

17:49.799 --> 17:53.792
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...

17:54.004 --> 17:56.699
...the mad craze
that's sweeping the world.

17:56.905 --> 18:01.035
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever continent we're on...

18:01.243 --> 18:04.837
...the great Wonka Bar search continues.
We're near the end...

18:05.113 --> 18:08.844
...of our 43rd day
in the Golden Ticket hunt.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.181
Everywhere, are signs of anxiety.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.145
Every hour...

18:13.353 --> 18:16.015
...new shipments
are sent around the globe.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.347
But they're not moving fast enough.

18:18.592 --> 18:22.994
And as time passes the men who seek them
become more and more desperate.

18:23.195 --> 18:27.325
Gentlemen, I know how anxious
you've been during these last few days.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.899
But now I think I can safely say...

18:30.102 --> 18:32.831
...that your time and money
have been well spent.

18:33.271 --> 18:37.037
We're about to witness
the greatest miracle of the machine age.

18:37.242 --> 18:41.075
Based on the revolutionary
law of probability, this machine...

18:41.278 --> 18:45.339
...will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining...

18:45.783 --> 18:47.444
...Golden Tickets.

18:56.224 --> 18:56.918
It says...

18:57.125 --> 18:59.958
..."I won't tell.
That would be cheating. "

19:06.400 --> 19:08.698
I am now telling the computer...

19:08.903 --> 19:12.930
...if it will tell me the correct answer
I will gladly share with it...

19:13.140 --> 19:14.902
...the grand prize.

19:19.579 --> 19:20.204
He says...

19:20.413 --> 19:25.145
..."What would a computer do
with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

19:29.321 --> 19:34.223
I am now telling the computer exactly
what he can do with the chocolate.

19:36.661 --> 19:39.891
It can happen here, too,
unbelievable as it sounds...

19:40.097 --> 19:41.724
...right here in America.

19:41.932 --> 19:45.891
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest dreams can come true.

19:46.737 --> 19:47.998
Here she is...

19:48.337 --> 19:52.068
...Violet Beauregarde,
finder of Golden Ticket number 3.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.969
From Miles City, Montana.

19:54.176 --> 19:55.575
And the proud parents.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.974
Mr. Beauregarde,
a local politician, civic leader...

19:59.180 --> 20:01.307
Sam Beauregarde,
Square Deal Sam to you...

20:01.516 --> 20:03.450
...with great giveaway bargains.

20:03.685 --> 20:06.084
The finest values in the entire country!

20:06.286 --> 20:08.413
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!

20:08.622 --> 20:10.453
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!

20:10.691 --> 20:13.853
Here is Golden Ticket number 3,
and it's all mine!

20:15.128 --> 20:17.926
I'm a gum chewer,
but when I heard about the tickets...

20:18.131 --> 20:20.258
...I laid off gum and switched to candy.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.829
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.

20:23.001 --> 20:25.936
I chew it all day, except at mealtimes
when I stick it behind my ear.

20:26.037 --> 20:27.595
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!

20:27.806 --> 20:32.674
This piece of gum I've been chewing
for three months. A world record!

20:32.877 --> 20:36.108
It beat the record
held by my friend, Cornelia...

20:36.313 --> 20:38.110
...and was she mad!

20:38.315 --> 20:39.781
Hi Cornelia, sweetie!

20:39.983 --> 20:42.884
Let me just say,
if any of you folks watching...

20:54.396 --> 20:57.626
- What are you doing here?
- I'll walk you home.

20:57.999 --> 21:01.127
I'm not ready.
I'm going to be here late.

21:01.335 --> 21:03.963
Then I guess I'll be going.

21:04.172 --> 21:05.866
Why not stay a minute.

21:06.072 --> 21:09.166
Pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.

21:11.745 --> 21:13.303
School all right?

21:13.513 --> 21:14.308
Yep.

21:14.513 --> 21:15.571
Good.

21:16.415 --> 21:18.007
Go on your newspaper route?

21:18.250 --> 21:19.217
Just finished.

21:19.418 --> 21:20.510
Good.

21:23.188 --> 21:25.247
I wanted to tell you something.

21:28.092 --> 21:29.821
They found the third ticket.

21:30.028 --> 21:31.255
Did they?

21:35.032 --> 21:36.693
I guess I'll be going now.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.195
That's all?

21:40.436 --> 21:42.336
I thought you'd like to know.

21:42.538 --> 21:46.167
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.537
There are only two tickets left,
you know. Just two.

21:49.778 --> 21:51.575
Pretty soon, just one.

21:51.780 --> 21:53.509
I wonder who'll be the lucky ones.

21:53.715 --> 21:55.740
If you're wondering,
it won't be me.

21:55.951 --> 21:58.851
If you're wondering,
you can count me out.

22:00.287 --> 22:02.414
There are 100 billion people...

22:02.623 --> 22:05.750
...and only 5 will find Golden Tickets.

22:05.959 --> 22:09.190
Even with a sack of money,
you probably wouldn't find one.

22:09.395 --> 22:14.025
When this is over you'll be no different
from billions of others who didn't.

22:14.234 --> 22:17.031
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.435
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.971
When? When will they change?

22:24.242 --> 22:26.574
Probably when you least expect it.

22:29.814 --> 22:30.906
See you later.

22:44.760 --> 22:48.753
You get blue like everyone

22:49.597 --> 22:52.657
But me and Grandpa Joe

22:53.167 --> 22:57.001
Can make your troubles go away

22:57.638 --> 22:59.663
Blow away

23:01.174 --> 23:03.506
There they go

23:05.612 --> 23:07.841
Cheer up, Charlie

23:09.181 --> 23:11.513
Give me a smile

23:12.118 --> 23:16.520
What happened
to that smile I used to know

23:18.790 --> 23:20.917
Don't you know your grin

23:21.126 --> 23:24.526
Has always been my sunshine

23:26.030 --> 23:29.022
Let that sunshine show

23:31.901 --> 23:34.131
Come on, Charlie

23:35.972 --> 23:38.304
No need to frown

23:38.875 --> 23:40.535
Deep down you know

23:40.876 --> 23:43.538
The world is still your toy

23:45.881 --> 23:47.974
When the world gets heavy

23:48.550 --> 23:50.881
Never pit-a-pat 'em

23:52.219 --> 23:55.211
Up and at 'em, boy

23:58.325 --> 23:59.986
Some day...

24:00.894 --> 24:02.885
...sweet as a song

24:03.897 --> 24:07.889
Charlie's lucky day will come along

24:10.502 --> 24:15.165
Till that day
you've got to stay strong, Charlie

24:17.241 --> 24:21.735
Up on top is right where you belong

24:24.414 --> 24:27.747
Look up, Charlie

24:28.185 --> 24:31.154
You'll see a star

24:31.355 --> 24:32.844
Just follow it

24:33.255 --> 24:37.248
And keep your dream in view

24:38.427 --> 24:43.090
Pretty soon the sky
is going to clear up, Charlie

24:45.934 --> 24:49.926
Cheer up, Charlie, do

24:52.539 --> 24:55.201
Cheer up, Charlie

24:57.044 --> 25:00.376
Just be glad you're you

25:10.455 --> 25:12.116
While the world searches...

25:12.391 --> 25:14.052
...here it has actually happened.

25:14.626 --> 25:18.527
There's only one Golden Ticket
left in the entire world.

25:18.729 --> 25:22.187
Because right here,
in Marble Falls, Arizona...

25:22.400 --> 25:24.196
...is lucky winner number four!

25:24.401 --> 25:28.201
The name to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee!

25:28.805 --> 25:30.204
Can we shut that off?

25:30.407 --> 25:33.204
- Are you crazy?
- He won't answer till station break.

25:33.409 --> 25:35.434
The country wants to hear from you!

25:35.644 --> 25:37.771
Can't you shut up?
I'm busy.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.106
What a show!

25:39.314 --> 25:41.111
I serve all his dinners here.

25:41.315 --> 25:42.782
He's never been to the table.

25:43.384 --> 25:44.783
- You love TV?
- You bet!

25:44.986 --> 25:46.613
About that Golden ticket...

25:46.821 --> 25:48.220
I want to catch this!

25:48.423 --> 25:51.391
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?

25:51.591 --> 25:53.320
Mike, would you tell us if...

25:54.995 --> 25:56.462
Wait till I get a real one.

25:56.663 --> 25:57.755
Colt 45.

25:57.998 --> 26:00.227
Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?

26:00.433 --> 26:02.424
Not till you're 12, son.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.805
Four down, one to go.

26:11.009 --> 26:15.139
And somewhere out there another
lucky person is moving closer...

26:15.346 --> 26:20.112
...to finding the last of the most
sought-after prizes in history.

26:20.617 --> 26:23.245
Though we can envy him,
whoever he is...

26:23.454 --> 26:26.422
...and might be tempted
to be bitter at our losing...

26:26.622 --> 26:29.591
...we must remember there are
more important things.

26:29.792 --> 26:32.283
Many more important things!

26:32.628 --> 26:36.358
Offhand, I can't think of what they are
but I'm sure there's something.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.121
Now for weather and...

26:40.869 --> 26:43.701
Why did you wake me up?
Is something wrong?

26:49.643 --> 26:51.803
Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.171
I've told you, I've given it up.

26:54.481 --> 26:55.778
Go on, open it!

26:55.982 --> 26:58.007
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.

26:58.218 --> 27:00.549
No, you do it. I can't.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.848
We're going to be lucky this time.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.490
I've got a funny feeling inside.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.658
Which end shall I open first?

27:11.829 --> 27:13.888
That end. Just a tiny bit.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.225
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

27:19.402 --> 27:22.337
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.

27:22.839 --> 27:24.170
All right.

27:24.508 --> 27:25.997
Here goes.

27:32.248 --> 27:33.407
You know...

27:34.415 --> 27:38.408
...I bet those Golden Tickets
make the chocolate taste terrible.

27:48.695 --> 27:50.753
Lot 403.

27:51.030 --> 27:53.396
I can personally guarantee...

27:53.633 --> 27:57.330
...that this is the absolutely
last case of Wonka Bars...

27:57.537 --> 27:59.060
...left in the United Kingdom.

27:59.271 --> 28:03.037
Shall we start the bidding at
1,000 pounds? Do I hear 1,000?

28:03.808 --> 28:05.002
1,500 pounds?

28:05.210 --> 28:06.609
2,000?

28:06.811 --> 28:08.038
I have 2,500.

28:08.279 --> 28:09.041
4,000?

28:09.780 --> 28:11.247
4,500 pounds?

28:11.448 --> 28:13.075
5,000?

28:13.284 --> 28:14.945
Your Majesty!

28:18.454 --> 28:20.183
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.585
There isn't anything to give us a clue.

28:22.792 --> 28:24.850
They kidnapped my husband
12 hours ago.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.085
When will we hear?
What do they want?

28:27.296 --> 28:30.959
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We wait to hear their demands.

28:31.466 --> 28:33.695
I'll give them anything they want.

28:33.901 --> 28:35.732
All I want is Harold back!

28:41.142 --> 28:42.574
Go ahead, we're listening.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.807
Whatever they asked for
they can have it.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.241
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

28:59.490 --> 29:01.151
Did you hear me?

29:01.993 --> 29:04.928
It's your husband's life
or your Wonka Bars.

29:06.164 --> 29:08.256
How long do I have to think it over?

29:10.000 --> 29:10.967
That's it!

29:11.168 --> 29:13.636
The Wonka contest is all over.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.896
The final ticket has been found...

29:16.106 --> 29:20.508
...we've got a live report in from
Paraguay, South America.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.144
It is finished.
The end has come.

29:23.346 --> 29:26.075
The last Golden Ticket has been found...

29:26.281 --> 29:27.646
...right here in Paraguay.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.818
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta...

29:31.019 --> 29:34.818
...the millionaire owner
of South America gambling casinos.

29:35.022 --> 29:38.480
Here is the most recent picture
of the happy finder.

29:39.927 --> 29:41.258
Turn it off!

29:42.695 --> 29:44.663
Well, that's that.

29:44.864 --> 29:46.422
No more Golden Tickets.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.658
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

29:48.868 --> 29:50.301
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.

29:50.536 --> 29:55.336
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?

29:55.540 --> 29:57.633
Who's going to tell him?

29:57.876 --> 30:00.776
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

30:00.978 --> 30:02.445
Yeah, let him sleep.

30:02.647 --> 30:05.047
Let him have one last dream.

30:12.822 --> 30:15.620
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.

30:15.825 --> 30:19.453
Which means Friday's test
on what we learned during the week...

30:19.662 --> 30:21.960
...will now be Monday
before we've learned it.

30:22.164 --> 30:24.394
Since today's Tuesday,
it doesn't matter.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.561
Pencils ready!

30:28.169 --> 30:31.070
Today, we are going to learn about...

30:32.674 --> 30:33.538
...percentages.

30:33.741 --> 30:37.369
For example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

30:37.577 --> 30:40.637
Suppose there are
1,000 Wonka Bars in the world...

30:40.847 --> 30:44.646
...and you each opened
a certain number of them.

30:44.850 --> 30:47.011
That number is...

30:47.353 --> 30:49.014
...a percent. Understand?

30:51.423 --> 30:53.948
Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

30:54.526 --> 30:55.584
About 100.

30:55.927 --> 31:00.886
There are ten 100's in 1,000,
therefore, you opened 10 percent.

31:01.365 --> 31:03.663
Peter Goff, how many did you open?

31:03.867 --> 31:05.095
150.

31:05.536 --> 31:10.336
10% half over again, which makes
15 percent. Charlie Bucket!

31:10.540 --> 31:12.735
- How many did you open?
- Two.

31:12.942 --> 31:14.432
That's easy. 200 is twice...

31:15.745 --> 31:17.144
Not 200.

31:17.713 --> 31:18.737
Just 2.

31:19.381 --> 31:22.111
What do you mean, you only opened 2?

31:22.617 --> 31:24.585
I don't care much for chocolate.

31:24.786 --> 31:26.685
I can't figure out just 2!

31:26.887 --> 31:29.014
Let's pretend you opened 200.

31:29.223 --> 31:33.523
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick...

31:33.728 --> 31:35.354
...you'd use 20% of 1,000...

31:35.562 --> 31:38.463
...which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...

32:28.175 --> 32:30.040
I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.

32:30.244 --> 32:31.370
Why, sure.

32:31.578 --> 32:32.636
What kind?

32:32.846 --> 32:35.814
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?

32:36.015 --> 32:39.007
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.

32:39.919 --> 32:43.082
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.

32:56.033 --> 32:57.660
Take it easy!

32:57.868 --> 33:00.029
You'll get a stomach ache.

33:00.371 --> 33:02.270
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, now.

33:10.045 --> 33:13.378
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

33:13.615 --> 33:14.877
Sure.

33:15.951 --> 33:17.850
Try a regular Wonka Bar.

33:18.052 --> 33:19.383
Fine.

33:32.299 --> 33:35.426
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?

33:35.668 --> 33:37.966
That gambler from Paraguay
made a phony ticket.

33:38.170 --> 33:41.298
There's one Golden Ticket
still floating around.

33:41.507 --> 33:44.441
The nerve of that guy!
Trying to fool the world!

33:45.276 --> 33:49.110
He was a crook! This means
the contest goes on forever.

34:33.052 --> 34:34.952
You got the last Golden Ticket!

34:35.154 --> 34:37.985
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

34:41.493 --> 34:43.893
Stand back!
Leave the boy alone!

34:46.731 --> 34:48.062
Break it up!

34:48.900 --> 34:51.300
Charlie! Hold onto that ticket!

34:51.502 --> 34:53.969
Run for it! Run straight home!

34:54.170 --> 34:56.228
Don't stop till you get there!

35:27.867 --> 35:29.494
I congratulate you.

35:29.702 --> 35:30.930
Well done.

35:31.370 --> 35:33.838
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.870
May I introduce myself?

35:36.107 --> 35:37.665
Arthur Slugworth.

35:37.876 --> 35:40.436
President of Slugworth Chocolates.

35:41.279 --> 35:45.180
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.

35:45.382 --> 35:49.113
Mr. Wonka is working on
a fantastic invention.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.884
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

35:52.556 --> 35:54.580
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

35:54.791 --> 35:58.090
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper...

35:58.294 --> 36:01.626
...and bring it to me
so I can find the secret formula.

36:01.964 --> 36:03.261
Your reward will be...

36:03.465 --> 36:05.524
...10,000 of these.

36:05.734 --> 36:07.395
Think it over, will you?

36:07.636 --> 36:09.604
A new house for your family...

36:09.805 --> 36:13.069
...food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

36:13.908 --> 36:15.705
And don't forget the name...

36:15.910 --> 36:18.140
...Everlasting Gobstopper.

36:47.504 --> 36:50.667
I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!

36:51.441 --> 36:53.567
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.

36:53.776 --> 36:56.574
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

36:56.779 --> 36:59.145
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!

36:59.348 --> 37:02.908
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar
and the ticket was in it!

37:03.118 --> 37:05.450
Look at it! See for yourself!

37:06.021 --> 37:08.455
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

37:09.024 --> 37:13.323
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder
of this Golden Ticket...

37:13.527 --> 37:17.486
"... from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates...

37:17.698 --> 37:21.929
"... at 10 o'clock in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!"

37:22.135 --> 37:26.936
"You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.267
"In your wildest dreams
you could not imagine...

37:30.475 --> 37:33.501
"... the marvelous surprises
that await you!"

37:33.712 --> 37:34.644
You've done it!

37:37.148 --> 37:39.776
It says I can take somebody with me.

37:39.984 --> 37:41.645
I wish you could go.

37:52.162 --> 37:53.322
Charlie!

38:00.169 --> 38:01.966
That's good, Charlie.

38:02.171 --> 38:03.728
Now help me up.

38:17.184 --> 38:18.310
Are you okay?

38:18.518 --> 38:20.576
I'm fine, Charlie.

38:30.595 --> 38:32.085
Watch it, Joe!

38:41.271 --> 38:42.761
Look at me!

38:45.775 --> 38:47.606
Look at me!

38:48.277 --> 38:50.268
Up and about!

38:51.881 --> 38:55.213
I haven't done this in 20 years!

39:01.757 --> 39:05.089
I never thought my life could be

39:06.761 --> 39:10.094
Anything but catastrophe

39:11.431 --> 39:14.423
But suddenly I begin to see

39:15.769 --> 39:18.431
A bit of good luck for me

39:20.773 --> 39:24.436
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

39:26.445 --> 39:29.436
I've got a golden twinkle...

39:30.782 --> 39:32.773
...in my eye

39:36.788 --> 39:39.347
I never had a chance to shine

39:39.556 --> 39:41.581
Never a happy song to sing

39:41.792 --> 39:43.760
But suddenly half the world is mine

39:43.960 --> 39:45.518
What an amazing thing

39:45.728 --> 39:47.593
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

39:47.797 --> 39:49.287
It's ours, Charlie!

39:49.799 --> 39:53.132
I've got a golden sun up in the sky

39:53.636 --> 39:55.296
Slippers, Charlie!

39:57.739 --> 40:01.038
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say

40:01.342 --> 40:04.174
Good morning
Look at the sun

40:05.012 --> 40:08.539
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury

40:08.749 --> 40:10.307
'Cause I'd have said

40:10.517 --> 40:12.040
It couldn't be done

40:12.251 --> 40:14.014
But it can be done

40:15.588 --> 40:17.579
The cane, Charlie!

40:22.360 --> 40:23.918
Here I go!

40:24.863 --> 40:26.694
Watch my speed!

40:33.270 --> 40:36.831
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

40:37.041 --> 40:41.067
But nevertheless it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

40:41.277 --> 40:42.710
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

40:44.280 --> 40:48.079
I've got a golden chance to make my way

40:48.283 --> 40:52.276
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

41:09.636 --> 41:12.627
Good morning! Look at the sun!

41:17.076 --> 41:20.806
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done

41:21.145 --> 41:23.306
But it can be done

41:24.482 --> 41:28.384
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

41:28.586 --> 41:32.453
But, nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

41:32.656 --> 41:35.147
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

41:35.492 --> 41:37.392
I've got a Golden Ticket

41:37.594 --> 41:41.222
I've got a golden chance to make my way

41:41.430 --> 41:45.423
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

41:50.272 --> 41:53.639
Stop! It says the first of October.
That's tomorrow.

41:53.842 --> 41:57.902
We've got a lot to do! Comb your hair,
wash your face, polish your shoes...

41:58.112 --> 42:01.138
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.

42:01.348 --> 42:05.340
Grandpa... on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

42:30.206 --> 42:31.935
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

42:32.142 --> 42:34.110
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

42:34.311 --> 42:36.939
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!

42:37.147 --> 42:38.010
How do I look?

42:38.213 --> 42:39.680
- You guys ready?
- You're on.

42:39.882 --> 42:41.509
This is the big day.

42:41.717 --> 42:46.619
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates
and shower gifts on the 5 lucky winners.

42:46.821 --> 42:50.120
From over the globe, people have
gathered, waiting for the hour...

42:50.325 --> 42:53.556
...to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.

42:56.063 --> 42:59.521
Hi, friends! Don't forget
to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...

42:59.733 --> 43:02.634
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!

43:02.836 --> 43:06.669
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?

43:19.851 --> 43:22.148
I want to go in first, before anybody.

43:22.353 --> 43:24.184
Anything you say.

43:27.424 --> 43:30.859
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.

43:33.763 --> 43:37.494
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.

43:37.700 --> 43:41.430
To see the greatest of them all,
Mr. Willy Wonka!

45:26.362 --> 45:27.693
Thank you.

45:28.698 --> 45:29.926
Welcome, my friends.

45:30.200 --> 45:32.224
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

45:32.868 --> 45:34.130
Would you come forward?

45:35.304 --> 45:37.431
Get back!
Come on, Veruca!

45:43.344 --> 45:45.778
That's Slugworth,
the man I told you about.

45:50.450 --> 45:53.283
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.

45:53.687 --> 45:55.086
I'm so glad you could come.

45:55.288 --> 45:59.189
This is going to be such an
exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

45:59.625 --> 46:01.115
I think you will.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.553
Please show me your Golden tickets.

46:04.697 --> 46:06.095
I'm Veruca Salt.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.424
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!

46:08.633 --> 46:10.760
You look pretty in that mink coat!

46:10.969 --> 46:12.630
I've got three others.

46:13.704 --> 46:17.037
Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?

46:17.307 --> 46:18.274
Augustus Gloop.

46:18.475 --> 46:20.443
Augustus, my dear boy!

46:20.644 --> 46:23.271
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!

46:23.479 --> 46:27.347
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.

46:27.550 --> 46:30.677
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.

46:30.886 --> 46:32.353
What kind of gum you got?

46:32.554 --> 46:33.816
Charming!

46:34.322 --> 46:35.619
Sam Beauregarde here!

46:35.824 --> 46:37.348
What a genuine pleasure.

46:37.559 --> 46:40.789
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.

46:40.995 --> 46:43.054
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"

46:43.998 --> 46:45.693
I'm Mike Teevee.

46:45.900 --> 46:47.367
Wham, you're dead!

46:47.568 --> 46:48.864
Wonderful to meet you!

46:49.068 --> 46:50.865
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

46:51.070 --> 46:53.732
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.

46:54.407 --> 46:55.203
Charlie Bucket.

46:55.408 --> 46:59.867
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?

47:00.078 --> 47:01.636
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

47:01.847 --> 47:02.779
Delighted.

47:03.015 --> 47:05.141
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.

47:05.349 --> 47:06.839
Are we ready?
Yes! Good!

47:07.185 --> 47:08.516
In with you!

47:43.850 --> 47:46.182
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.

47:46.353 --> 47:49.412
Hurry, we have so much time
and so little to see.

47:49.622 --> 47:51.590
Wait a minute! Strike that.

47:51.791 --> 47:54.123
Reverse it. Thank you.

47:56.028 --> 47:59.326
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

47:59.531 --> 48:00.964
Boy, what weird coat hangers!

48:03.635 --> 48:08.037
Surprises around every corner, but
nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.

48:08.305 --> 48:10.933
As soon as your outer vestments
are in hand...

48:11.141 --> 48:12.472
...we'll begin.

48:13.143 --> 48:14.006
Now...

48:14.210 --> 48:17.202
...will the children
kindly step up here.

48:28.257 --> 48:30.316
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

48:30.592 --> 48:33.059
I didn't know we had to sign anything.

48:33.261 --> 48:34.819
I can't read the bottom.

48:35.363 --> 48:37.228
Violet, you first.

48:37.431 --> 48:38.557
Sign here.

48:38.766 --> 48:39.733
Hold it!

48:39.933 --> 48:42.163
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.

48:42.435 --> 48:43.663
What's this about?

48:43.870 --> 48:45.497
Standard form of contract.

48:45.705 --> 48:49.333
Don't talk contracts, I use them myself.
They're for suckers.

48:49.541 --> 48:52.840
You wouldn't begrudge me
a little protection? A drop?

48:53.045 --> 48:54.376
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.

48:54.613 --> 48:57.342
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.

48:57.615 --> 48:59.173
I'm sorry. House rules.

48:59.384 --> 49:03.343
- I want to go in. Don't try to stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.

49:03.554 --> 49:07.956
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.

49:08.792 --> 49:12.421
Nicely handled! She's a girl
who knows where she's going.

49:13.563 --> 49:15.393
What's all that small print?

49:16.065 --> 49:18.761
Any problems? Dial Information.
Thanks for calling.

49:22.338 --> 49:24.805
I assume there's
an accident indemnity clause?

49:25.006 --> 49:25.995
Never between friends.

49:26.574 --> 49:29.771
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed
his wife's insurance policy.

49:30.178 --> 49:31.974
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

49:32.112 --> 49:33.044
What about me, Grandpa?

49:33.247 --> 49:35.647
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.

49:35.849 --> 49:37.817
Let's go in! Come on!

49:38.018 --> 49:41.145
Patience.
Everything has to be in order.

49:41.354 --> 49:43.185
Everyone signed? Yes?

49:43.523 --> 49:45.013
Good. On we go!

49:54.533 --> 49:56.091
Ninety-nine...

49:56.435 --> 49:57.594
...forty-four...

49:57.935 --> 49:59.698
...one hundred percent pure.

50:01.372 --> 50:03.533
Just through the other door, please.

50:05.876 --> 50:07.706
There's some mistake here.

50:08.378 --> 50:10.107
There is no other door.

50:10.380 --> 50:11.506
There's no way out!

50:11.715 --> 50:14.513
I know there's a door here someplace.

50:14.717 --> 50:16.582
I don't like this, Wonka!

50:16.785 --> 50:18.082
Is this a trick?

50:18.287 --> 50:20.187
Mr. Wonka, help!

50:20.389 --> 50:21.856
I'm getting squashed!
Save me!

50:22.057 --> 50:24.422
Is it my soul that calls my name?

50:24.625 --> 50:26.058
Let me out or I'll scream!

50:26.394 --> 50:28.760
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!

50:28.963 --> 50:33.558
Question time will come at the end
of the session. We must press on.

50:35.168 --> 50:36.795
- Here we are.
- Don't be a fool.

50:37.003 --> 50:38.436
That's the way we came in.

50:38.772 --> 50:40.898
It is? Are you sure?

50:41.607 --> 50:43.302
We've just come through there.

50:43.509 --> 50:44.999
How do you like that?

50:46.278 --> 50:48.143
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka?

50:48.347 --> 50:49.142
A funhouse?

50:50.115 --> 50:51.241
Why? Having fun?

50:51.449 --> 50:53.417
I'm not going in there.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.245
We're getting out of here.

50:55.453 --> 50:58.910
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.

50:59.123 --> 51:00.613
Better press on.

51:01.525 --> 51:04.085
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!

51:04.294 --> 51:06.523
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

51:06.963 --> 51:09.659
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.959
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.

51:12.502 --> 51:14.834
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.

51:15.036 --> 51:17.266
You can't squeeze me through that door.

51:17.472 --> 51:19.940
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.

51:20.142 --> 51:21.507
My dear friends...

51:21.710 --> 51:24.610
...you are now about to enter
the nerve center...

51:24.812 --> 51:27.076
...to the entire Wonka factory.

51:27.982 --> 51:32.112
Inside this room,
all of my dreams become realities.

51:32.318 --> 51:34.343
And some of my realities become dreams.

51:34.554 --> 51:38.354
And almost everything you'll see
is eatable... edible.

51:38.558 --> 51:40.549
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

51:40.826 --> 51:42.350
Let me in, I'm starving!

51:42.561 --> 51:45.587
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.

51:45.798 --> 51:47.561
We wouldn't want to lose that.

51:49.667 --> 51:50.793
Yet.

51:51.002 --> 51:52.799
Now, the combination.

51:53.004 --> 51:54.995
This is a musical lock.

51:57.508 --> 51:58.701
Rachmaninoff.

51:58.909 --> 52:00.001
Ladies and gentlemen...

52:01.344 --> 52:03.005
...boys and girls...

52:04.014 --> 52:05.743
...the Chocolate Room.

52:43.882 --> 52:45.747
Hold your breath. Make a wish.

52:46.785 --> 52:47.979
Count to three.

52:48.787 --> 52:50.253
Come with me

52:50.621 --> 52:52.418
And you'll be

52:52.623 --> 52:56.286
In a world of pure imagination

52:56.727 --> 52:58.194
Take a look

52:58.394 --> 53:02.387
And you'll see into your imagination

53:09.805 --> 53:11.796
We'll begin

53:12.474 --> 53:13.839
With a spin

53:14.042 --> 53:17.738
Traveling in the world of my creation

53:18.246 --> 53:20.908
What we'll see will defy

53:23.017 --> 53:24.916
Explanation

53:35.928 --> 53:38.920
If you want to view paradise

53:39.598 --> 53:42.259
Simply look around and view it

53:44.035 --> 53:46.526
Anything you want to, do it

53:47.939 --> 53:49.930
Want to change the world

53:51.708 --> 53:53.767
There's nothing to it

54:02.518 --> 54:03.348
Hurry, Violet!

54:03.553 --> 54:05.145
This way, Grandpa!

54:11.793 --> 54:14.694
There is no life I know

54:14.896 --> 54:17.921
To compare with pure imagination

54:18.132 --> 54:20.566
Living there
You'll be free

54:21.569 --> 54:24.470
If you truly wish to be

55:06.475 --> 55:09.500
If you want to view paradise

55:10.511 --> 55:13.173
Simply look around and view it

55:14.282 --> 55:17.341
Anything you want to, do it

55:18.185 --> 55:20.745
Want to change the world

55:20.954 --> 55:22.945
There's nothing...

55:23.624 --> 55:25.682
...to it

55:36.968 --> 55:40.028
There is no life I know

55:42.206 --> 55:46.643
To compare with pure imagination

55:48.960 --> 55:50.621
Living there

55:52.663 --> 55:54.790
You'll be free

55:55.800 --> 55:59.099
If you truly...

56:01.071 --> 56:04.734
...wish to be

56:16.851 --> 56:18.614
What a disgusting, dirty river!

56:18.820 --> 56:20.219
It's industrial waste.

56:20.421 --> 56:22.548
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.

56:22.757 --> 56:23.724
It's chocolate.

56:23.925 --> 56:25.221
That's chocolate?

56:25.425 --> 56:26.619
That's chocolate.

56:26.827 --> 56:28.294
A chocolate river.

56:28.495 --> 56:30.895
The most fantastic thing I've ever seen.

56:31.098 --> 56:32.759
10,000 gallons an hour.

56:32.999 --> 56:36.764
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

56:37.837 --> 56:41.637
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

56:41.841 --> 56:45.606
No other factory in the world
mixes chocolate by waterfall.

56:46.010 --> 56:49.241
But it's the only way
if you want it just right.

56:49.447 --> 56:51.846
Grandpa, look over across the river!

56:52.182 --> 56:53.149
Little men!

56:53.350 --> 56:55.284
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

56:55.619 --> 56:57.450
Now we know who makes it.

56:57.688 --> 57:00.850
I never saw anybody
with an orange face before.

57:01.691 --> 57:03.591
Funny looking people.

57:03.793 --> 57:05.488
What are they doing?

57:05.695 --> 57:07.094
Creaming and sugaring time.

57:07.296 --> 57:10.355
- They can't be real people.
- Of course, they're real people.

57:10.632 --> 57:11.758
Nonsense!

57:11.967 --> 57:13.867
No, Oompa Loompas.

57:15.203 --> 57:15.999
From Loompaland.

57:16.204 --> 57:18.000
Loompaland?
There's no such place!

57:18.205 --> 57:19.672
Excuse me, dear lady...

57:19.874 --> 57:21.171
I teach geography.

57:21.375 --> 57:22.774
Then you know all about it.

57:22.977 --> 57:24.501
And what a terrible country it is.

57:24.712 --> 57:27.839
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

57:28.047 --> 57:31.107
The poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless...

57:31.317 --> 57:33.615
...they would get gobbled up.

57:34.020 --> 57:36.886
A Wangdoodle would eat
ten of them for breakfast.

57:37.723 --> 57:39.054
And so I said...

57:39.391 --> 57:42.189
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety...

57:42.394 --> 57:45.294
"... away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers...

57:45.496 --> 57:49.023
"... and Snozzwangers
and rotten Vermicious Knids. "

57:49.233 --> 57:53.191
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

57:53.403 --> 57:55.894
I'm sorry, questions
must be submitted in writing.

57:56.173 --> 57:58.141
So, in the greatest of secrecy...

57:58.341 --> 58:01.867
...I transported the entire population
of Oompa Loompas here.

58:02.077 --> 58:05.979
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!

58:06.182 --> 58:08.672
All right, I'll get you one
before the day's out.

58:09.184 --> 58:11.550
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

58:11.753 --> 58:13.084
Can it, you nit!

58:13.922 --> 58:15.549
This is terrific.

58:15.757 --> 58:19.089
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

58:19.526 --> 58:23.087
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

58:23.363 --> 58:27.355
Don't do that! My chocolate
must never be touched by human hands.

58:28.201 --> 58:30.829
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!

58:31.037 --> 58:33.198
Please, I beg you!
Augustus!

58:34.606 --> 58:35.732
My chocolate!

58:35.941 --> 58:37.033
Help!

58:38.210 --> 58:40.440
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!

58:41.947 --> 58:44.244
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

58:44.448 --> 58:46.541
Help. Police. Murder.

58:47.952 --> 58:49.544
Grab this!

58:50.487 --> 58:52.113
What's happening to him?

58:52.388 --> 58:53.855
- Looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!

58:54.057 --> 58:55.422
- Save him!
- It's too late.

58:55.625 --> 58:57.024
- Too late?
- He's had it now.

58:57.227 --> 58:59.718
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!

59:00.230 --> 59:01.355
Where is he?

59:01.563 --> 59:02.621
Watch the pipe.

59:03.232 --> 59:05.393
How long is he going to stay down?

59:05.801 --> 59:07.962
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.

59:08.570 --> 59:10.196
His coat's going up the pipe!

59:10.404 --> 59:11.428
Call a plumber!

59:11.639 --> 59:13.607
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?

59:13.808 --> 59:15.139
It's his stomach.

59:16.310 --> 59:18.743
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?

59:19.312 --> 59:23.578
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.

59:24.417 --> 59:26.782
I wonder how long it's going to take?

59:26.986 --> 59:29.045
The suspense is terrible.

59:29.255 --> 59:30.244
I hope it'll last.

59:33.325 --> 59:35.121
He'll never get out.

59:35.326 --> 59:36.452
Yes, he will.

59:36.661 --> 59:39.892
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

59:41.165 --> 59:43.394
He'll be marshmallows in 5 seconds!

59:43.600 --> 59:46.501
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?

59:47.271 --> 59:49.637
Because that pipe
goes to the Fudge Room.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.171
You terrible man!

59:53.943 --> 59:56.571
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room,
but look sharp...

59:56.779 --> 59:58.974
...or her boy will get in the boiler.

59:59.181 --> 01:00:00.909
You boiled him up!

01:00:01.116 --> 01:00:04.745
Nil desperandum. Across the desert
lies the promised land.

01:00:04.953 --> 01:00:06.318
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

01:00:06.521 --> 01:00:11.014
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.

01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:14.757
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

01:00:14.962 --> 01:00:18.021
I've got a perfect puzzle for you

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.889
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:24.662
If you are wise you'll listen to me

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.862
What do you get
when you guzzle down sweets?

01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:31.198
Eating as much as an elephant eats

01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:34.445
What are you at getting terribly fat?

01:00:34.646 --> 01:00:39.048
What do you think will come of that?

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.211
I don't like the look of it

01:00:41.419 --> 01:00:44.216
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

01:00:44.654 --> 01:00:47.555
If you're not greedy,
you will go far

01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:50.726
You will live in happiness too

01:00:51.127 --> 01:00:54.721
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

01:01:04.672 --> 01:01:07.232
What kind of place you running here?

01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:12.677
What's he talking about?

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.327
Wow, what a boat!

01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:35.521
Looks good enough to eat!

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.159
That's a nice little canoe.

01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:42.396
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by. "

01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:43.664
All aboard!

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:45.898
Ladies first.
That means Veruca.

01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:49.078
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.

01:01:49.278 --> 01:01:52.838
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.

01:01:53.048 --> 01:01:55.243
She's très jolie,
but is she seaworthy?

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.011
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.

01:01:59.221 --> 01:02:03.122
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard!

01:02:04.558 --> 01:02:06.423
You're going to love this.

01:02:06.627 --> 01:02:07.958
Just love it.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:42.447
I want a boat like this. A beautiful
paddle boat, that's what I want.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:45.252
What she wants is a kick in the pants.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:46.891
I'm going to be seasick.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.563
- Try one of these.
- What are they?

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:51.392
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in 7 colors.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.066
Spitting's a dirty habit.

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:54.826
I know a worse one.

01:03:06.613 --> 01:03:09.446
- What business are you in?
- Nuts.

01:03:21.793 --> 01:03:22.691
Where are we going?

01:03:23.128 --> 01:03:24.891
I don't like that tunnel.

01:03:25.096 --> 01:03:26.393
I want off!

01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:31.533
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!

01:03:32.203 --> 01:03:34.535
I don't like this ride, Daddy!

01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:40.338
We're going too fast!

01:03:40.543 --> 01:03:42.010
We're going to sink!

01:03:42.212 --> 01:03:44.339
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?!
- Faster!

01:03:44.547 --> 01:03:46.707
Close your eyes and hang on tight!

01:03:51.386 --> 01:03:53.717
- What is this, a freak-out?!
- This isn't funny!

01:03:54.222 --> 01:03:56.349
You can't possibly see
where you're going!

01:03:56.557 --> 01:03:58.491
You're right. I can't.

01:03:58.726 --> 01:04:00.660
This would make a great series!

01:04:02.562 --> 01:04:06.999
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun!

01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:10.899
I want to get off the boat, Wonka!

01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:14.139
I may get sick!

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.807
This is going too far!

01:04:16.008 --> 01:04:18.670
Tell that little guy to turn us around!

01:04:19.344 --> 01:04:20.675
Now I am going to be sick!

01:04:28.685 --> 01:04:32.246
There's no earthly way of knowing

01:04:33.524 --> 01:04:36.515
Which direction we are going

01:04:37.093 --> 01:04:40.927
There's no knowing where we're rowing

01:04:41.531 --> 01:04:44.523
Or which way the river's flowing

01:04:45.033 --> 01:04:47.058
Is it raining

01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:49.669
Is it snowing

01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:53.863
Is a hurricane a-blowing

01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:59.375
Not a speck of light is showing,
so the danger must be growing!

01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:02.437
Are the fires of hell a-blowing?

01:05:03.283 --> 01:05:05.911
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.416
Yes!

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:12.249
The danger must be growing
for the rowers keep on rowing!

01:05:12.457 --> 01:05:15.449
And they're certainly not showing...

01:05:15.761 --> 01:05:19.628
...any signs that they are slowing!

01:05:24.402 --> 01:05:26.529
Make him stop, Daddy!

01:05:26.737 --> 01:05:28.761
- This has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.

01:05:28.972 --> 01:05:30.166
Stop the boat!

01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:33.603
- We're there.
- Where?

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:34.708
Here.

01:05:34.911 --> 01:05:38.573
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:40.381
All ashore!

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:42.551
Let me off this freight!

01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:45.776
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.

01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:47.045
What a nightmare!

01:05:47.255 --> 01:05:49.883
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

01:05:50.091 --> 01:05:50.955
"Dairy cream. "

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:52.057
"Whipped cream. "

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.090
- "Coffee cream. "
- "Vanilla cream. "

01:05:54.995 --> 01:05:56.690
"Hair cream?"

01:05:59.967 --> 01:06:01.161
That's not French.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.430
I can't take much more.

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:14.476
The Inventing Room.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:17.641
Now remember, no messing about.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.578
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

01:06:20.784 --> 01:06:21.648
No telling what?

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:26.118
All of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

01:06:26.523 --> 01:06:30.253
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth
to get inside for five minutes.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.190
So don't touch a thing!

01:06:58.585 --> 01:06:59.381
Inventing room?

01:06:59.586 --> 01:07:01.486
Looks more like a Turkish bath.

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:05.145
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

01:07:05.357 --> 01:07:07.825
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does cleaning?

01:07:08.027 --> 01:07:09.392
Shouldn't you wear gloves?

01:07:09.595 --> 01:07:11.721
You'll have health inspectors after you.

01:07:11.929 --> 01:07:15.729
Invention, my dear friends,
is 93% perspiration...

01:07:15.933 --> 01:07:17.992
...6% electricity...

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:19.999
...4% evaporation...

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.501
...and 2% butterscotch ripple.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.901
That's one hundred and five percent!

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.370
Any good?

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:28.868
Yes.

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.711
Excuse me.

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:36.551
Time is a precious thing.
Never waste it.

01:07:38.386 --> 01:07:42.117
- He's absolutely bonkers!
- That's not bad.

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:47.856
In springtime
The only pretty ring time

01:07:48.062 --> 01:07:51.088
Birds sing
Hey, ding a ding-a-ding

01:07:51.298 --> 01:07:53.698
Sweet lovers love...

01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:55.294
...the spring

01:07:58.371 --> 01:08:00.430
I told you not to, silly boy.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.937
Your teeth!

01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:03.732
Boy, that's great stuff.

01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:07.603
That's exploding candy,
for your enemies. Great idea.

01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:10.407
Not ready yet.
Needs more gel ignite.

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:21.886
What's that for?

01:08:22.091 --> 01:08:23.582
Gives it a little kick.

01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:27.421
Wonka!

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.661
Butterscotch? Buttergin?

01:08:31.934 --> 01:08:33.731
Something going on inside?

01:08:33.935 --> 01:08:36.837
"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. "

01:08:40.508 --> 01:08:42.908
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

01:08:43.111 --> 01:08:45.136
Too cold! Far too cold.

01:08:45.345 --> 01:08:47.676
That's gourmet cooking for you.

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:50.573
No! Don't, please.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:53.680
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.819
This is the most secret machine
in my factory.

01:08:57.189 --> 01:09:00.680
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?

01:09:02.294 --> 01:09:04.453
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!

01:09:27.984 --> 01:09:29.109
What's it do?

01:09:29.318 --> 01:09:32.286
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

01:09:32.487 --> 01:09:34.182
Everlasting Gobstoppers?

01:09:34.389 --> 01:09:37.517
For children with little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:39.522
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!

01:09:39.727 --> 01:09:40.694
- Me, too!
- And me!

01:09:40.895 --> 01:09:43.455
Fantastic. Revolutionize the industry.

01:09:43.663 --> 01:09:47.292
You suck them and they'll
never get smaller. Never...

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.626
...I think.

01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:50.859
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:54.631
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.

01:09:54.841 --> 01:09:58.241
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! Me! I do!

01:09:59.244 --> 01:10:03.647
I can only give them to you if you
swear to keep them for yourselves.

01:10:03.848 --> 01:10:07.841
And never show them
to another soul as long as you live.

01:10:08.419 --> 01:10:09.147
Agreed?

01:10:09.353 --> 01:10:10.320
Agreed!

01:10:10.521 --> 01:10:13.978
Good. One for you,
and one for you, and one for you.

01:10:14.191 --> 01:10:15.522
What about Charlie?

01:10:15.859 --> 01:10:17.156
And one for Charlie.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.726
Hey, she's got two!
I want another!

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:22.727
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has one.

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:26.424
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.565
If you'll follow me...

01:10:29.838 --> 01:10:31.999
...I have something special to show you.

01:10:32.207 --> 01:10:33.697
It's special, all right.

01:10:34.209 --> 01:10:36.404
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.

01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:37.737
What a contraption!

01:10:37.946 --> 01:10:39.003
Isn't she scrumptious?

01:10:39.213 --> 01:10:42.011
My revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

01:10:43.016 --> 01:10:45.541
Button, button,
who's got the button?

01:10:45.953 --> 01:10:47.442
It's over there.

01:10:48.054 --> 01:10:49.214
- Here?
- Yeah.

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:07.429
What you are witnessing, dear friends...

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:10.607
...is the most enormous miracle
of the Machine Age.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:13.742
The creation of a confectionery giant!

01:11:23.418 --> 01:11:24.817
- Finito!
- That's all?

01:11:25.487 --> 01:11:27.478
Don't you know what this is?

01:11:27.756 --> 01:11:29.451
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:32.785
It's the most fabulous,
sensational gum in the world!

01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:34.726
What's so fab about it?

01:11:34.929 --> 01:11:38.057
- This piece of gum is a 3-course dinner.
- Bull!

01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:41.234
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!

01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:43.561
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:45.465
If it's gum, that's for me.

01:11:45.672 --> 01:11:47.730
Violet, don't do anything stupid.

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.771
What's it taste like?

01:11:50.109 --> 01:11:52.669
Madness! It's tomato soup!

01:11:53.112 --> 01:11:55.841
It's creamy. I can feel it
running down my throat!

01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:57.748
Stop. Don't.

01:11:57.949 --> 01:11:59.473
Why doesn't she listen?

01:11:59.684 --> 01:12:02.244
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.746
Great soup!

01:12:03.955 --> 01:12:05.751
The second course is coming.

01:12:05.956 --> 01:12:08.288
Roast beef and a baked potato!

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.521
With sour cream?

01:12:12.029 --> 01:12:14.826
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:19.092
Blueberry pie and cream! It's
the most marvelous pie I've ever tasted!

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:21.769
- What's happening to your face?
- Cool it!

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:22.994
Let me finish.

01:12:23.204 --> 01:12:24.831
You're face is turning blue!

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.168
- You're turning violet, Violet!
- What do you mean?

01:12:28.376 --> 01:12:30.605
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.

01:12:30.811 --> 01:12:33.177
Look what it's done to my kid!

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.713
It always goes wrong when we
come to the desserts. Always.

01:12:38.018 --> 01:12:39.109
What are you doing!

01:12:39.319 --> 01:12:41.287
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:43.512
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?!

01:12:43.723 --> 01:12:45.691
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

01:12:45.892 --> 01:12:47.825
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.526
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:53.789
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!

01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:55.523
I'll break you for this!

01:12:55.734 --> 01:12:57.701
I'll get it right in the end.

01:12:57.969 --> 01:12:58.697
Help!

01:12:58.903 --> 01:13:01.371
We've got to let the air out of her!

01:13:01.605 --> 01:13:02.799
There's no air.

01:13:03.007 --> 01:13:04.531
- That's juice.
- Juice?

01:13:04.742 --> 01:13:07.869
Would you roll her down
to the juicing room?

01:13:08.078 --> 01:13:10.137
- What for?
- For squeezing.

01:13:10.347 --> 01:13:12.713
She has to be squeezed
before she explodes.

01:13:12.916 --> 01:13:15.315
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

01:13:16.752 --> 01:13:19.220
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

01:13:19.421 --> 01:13:22.878
I've got another puzzle for you

01:13:23.091 --> 01:13:26.254
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:30.319
If you are wise you'll listen to me

01:13:30.565 --> 01:13:33.590
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while

01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:37.496
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:41.002
But it's repulsive
Revolting and wrong

01:13:41.207 --> 01:13:43.072
Chewing and chewing

01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:45.368
All day long

01:13:46.879 --> 01:13:48.869
The way that a cow does

01:13:50.448 --> 01:13:53.110
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:57.110
Given good manners
You will go far

01:13:57.788 --> 01:14:00.450
You will live in happiness too

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:04.749
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

01:14:09.732 --> 01:14:13.099
I'll get even with you for this,
if it's the last thing I do!

01:14:13.302 --> 01:14:15.895
I got a blueberry for a daughter!

01:14:16.838 --> 01:14:20.638
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:23.633
Shall we roll on?

01:14:27.915 --> 01:14:29.246
Thank you.

01:14:30.084 --> 01:14:34.543
Well, well, well!
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.

01:14:35.088 --> 01:14:38.489
Three good, sweet little children left.

01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:43.425
Hurry, please.
Long way to go yet.

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:49.058
Wait a minute.
Must show you this.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.895
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

01:14:52.103 --> 01:14:56.631
Lick an orange or pineapple.
It tastes like them. Try it!

01:14:58.308 --> 01:15:00.276
I got a plum!

01:15:00.477 --> 01:15:03.913
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!

01:15:04.147 --> 01:15:07.240
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:09.816
The snozzberries
taste like snozzberries.

01:15:10.019 --> 01:15:13.182
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?

01:15:14.255 --> 01:15:16.655
We are the music makers.

01:15:16.991 --> 01:15:20.290
And we are the dreamers of dreams.

01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:22.895
Come along.

01:15:25.933 --> 01:15:28.766
Something very unusual in here.

01:15:29.103 --> 01:15:32.401
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink.

01:15:32.605 --> 01:15:33.401
Yet.

01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:35.073
What's it making?

01:15:35.274 --> 01:15:39.937
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you
with gas and the gas lifts you...

01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:42.579
...off the ground like a balloon.

01:15:42.781 --> 01:15:44.373
Isn't it high?

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:46.474
But it's still too powerful.

01:15:46.685 --> 01:15:47.879
Let us try some!

01:15:48.619 --> 01:15:52.988
No, no. There'd be children
floating all over the place!

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:55.124
Come along, don't hang about.

01:15:55.793 --> 01:15:58.192
You'll be wild about this next one.

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:01.829
Let's take a drink.
No one's watching.

01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:03.794
A small one won't hurt us.

01:16:09.204 --> 01:16:10.637
Not bad.

01:16:12.808 --> 01:16:14.036
Well?

01:16:14.309 --> 01:16:15.866
Nothing's happening.

01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:19.341
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why!

01:16:21.816 --> 01:16:23.407
I feel terribly strange.

01:16:23.617 --> 01:16:26.484
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie!

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.452
- Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!

01:16:31.657 --> 01:16:33.454
- You're right, but...
- I'll try and get down.

01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:36.651
All right, Charlie,
but, please, be careful.

01:16:37.663 --> 01:16:41.530
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!

01:16:41.733 --> 01:16:44.702
- I haven't swam in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!

01:16:44.903 --> 01:16:46.837
I don't think I ought to.

01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:51.406
This is great!

01:16:51.842 --> 01:16:53.241
Try this, Grandpa!

01:16:53.577 --> 01:16:55.841
All right, Charlie.
Wait for me!

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:02.549
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.885
This is really great!

01:17:06.087 --> 01:17:08.112
Look, I'm a bird!

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:12.353
I feel light as a feather.

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.355
Look down.

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.427
We're really high now.

01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:22.262
Watch this, Grandpa.

01:17:25.872 --> 01:17:27.339
Wonderful, Charlie!

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.735
- Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!

01:17:29.943 --> 01:17:31.410
Come on, Grandpa!

01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:33.100
All right.

01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:37.608
Hey, you did it, Grandpa!

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:40.847
I hit an air pocket.

01:17:41.052 --> 01:17:43.077
You can fly to the moon this way!

01:17:43.287 --> 01:17:45.255
Let's fly south for the winter.

01:17:45.456 --> 01:17:46.889
Why not?

01:17:48.726 --> 01:17:49.783
I'm a bird!

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.357
I'm a plane!

01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:52.550
I'm...

01:17:52.796 --> 01:17:54.627
...going too high!

01:17:55.465 --> 01:17:57.729
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

01:17:57.967 --> 01:17:58.934
Help!

01:17:59.134 --> 01:18:00.761
Grandpa, the fan!

01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:03.029
It’ll chop us to bits!

01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:05.469
We're in trouble!
I can't stop!

01:18:05.741 --> 01:18:07.037
It's pulling me in!

01:18:07.242 --> 01:18:09.107
I can't stop!

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.676
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.907
There's nothing to grab onto! Help!

01:18:15.382 --> 01:18:16.713
We'll be killed!

01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:18.677
Help! Help!

01:18:18.885 --> 01:18:21.718
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan!

01:18:25.124 --> 01:18:26.887
I'm going down!

01:18:27.293 --> 01:18:30.023
Burp! If you don't,
it'll cut you to ribbons!

01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:32.355
- I can't! Help!
- You've got to burp!

01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:34.464
It's the only way!

01:18:34.733 --> 01:18:37.031
That-a-boy! Burp again!

01:18:37.235 --> 01:18:39.135
That-a-boy! Come on!

01:18:41.405 --> 01:18:43.566
That's wonderful, Charlie!

01:18:50.079 --> 01:18:52.377
Grab on.
We're going to be all right.

01:19:01.323 --> 01:19:02.517
Good boy!

01:19:03.091 --> 01:19:05.457
From now on
we keep our feet on the ground.

01:19:05.661 --> 01:19:07.753
Let's catch up to the others!

01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:12.058
I know what you're thinking.

01:19:12.266 --> 01:19:14.291
They can't be doing that.

01:19:14.502 --> 01:19:16.560
But they are. They have to.

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:18.897
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.

01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:21.667
The geese that lay the golden eggs!

01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:24.502
They're larger than ordinary geese.

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.837
They're quadruple-size,
which produce...

01:19:27.046 --> 01:19:30.174
...octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.

01:19:30.382 --> 01:19:31.713
But Easter's over!

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:33.949
They don't know that.

01:19:34.152 --> 01:19:36.450
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

01:19:38.056 --> 01:19:39.990
What if they drop an egg?

01:19:40.491 --> 01:19:43.050
An omelet fit for a king, sir.

01:19:43.393 --> 01:19:44.985
Are they chocolate eggs?

01:19:45.228 --> 01:19:48.026
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.

01:19:48.231 --> 01:19:49.698
But don't get too close.

01:19:49.899 --> 01:19:53.494
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.

01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:56.999
The Eggdicator tells the difference
between a good egg...

01:19:57.673 --> 01:19:58.866
...and a bad egg.

01:19:59.074 --> 01:20:02.475
If it's good, it's shined
and shipped over the world.

01:20:02.844 --> 01:20:04.744
If it's a bad egg...

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.169
...down the chute.

01:20:11.418 --> 01:20:13.045
An educated Eggdicator.

01:20:13.253 --> 01:20:14.845
It's a lot of nonsense.

01:20:15.422 --> 01:20:18.390
A little nonsense now and then...

01:20:18.591 --> 01:20:21.924
...Is relished by the wisest men.

01:20:22.695 --> 01:20:24.389
I want a golden goose!

01:20:24.596 --> 01:20:25.688
Here we go again.

01:20:25.931 --> 01:20:27.558
All right, sweetheart.

01:20:27.766 --> 01:20:29.961
You'll get one as soon as we get home.

01:20:30.202 --> 01:20:32.534
No, I want one of those!

01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:35.399
How much do you want for the goose?

01:20:35.606 --> 01:20:37.005
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:38.232
She can't have one.

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:39.739
Who says I can't?

01:20:39.944 --> 01:20:41.672
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!

01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:43.903
I want a golden goose!

01:20:44.114 --> 01:20:45.172
Gooses!

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.576
Geeses!

01:20:46.783 --> 01:20:49.411
I want my geese to lay
gold eggs for Easter.

01:20:49.619 --> 01:20:51.848
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.

01:20:52.054 --> 01:20:55.023
- Anything you say.
- And by the way!

01:20:55.224 --> 01:20:56.521
I want a feast.

01:20:56.725 --> 01:20:58.420
You ate before you came.

01:20:58.627 --> 01:21:00.423
I want a bean-feast

01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:01.424
One of those.

01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:04.530
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts

01:21:04.732 --> 01:21:07.928
- So good you could go nuts
- You'll have it when you get home.

01:21:08.135 --> 01:21:11.400
No, now! I want a ball!

01:21:11.638 --> 01:21:13.697
I want a party

01:21:13.974 --> 01:21:15.964
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons

01:21:16.242 --> 01:21:18.437
And performing baboons and...

01:21:18.644 --> 01:21:19.975
...give it to me

01:21:20.479 --> 01:21:21.377
Now!

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.707
I want the world

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:26.213
I want the whole world

01:21:26.418 --> 01:21:30.718
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate

01:21:30.922 --> 01:21:33.890
Give it to me now

01:21:34.091 --> 01:21:36.218
I want today

01:21:36.427 --> 01:21:38.452
I want tomorrow

01:21:38.662 --> 01:21:41.290
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair

01:21:41.498 --> 01:21:43.590
And I don't want to share them

01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:51.065
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:54.071
10,000 tons of ice cream

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:58.645
And if I don't get the things I am after

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:02.282
I'm going to scream

01:22:12.692 --> 01:22:13.989
I want the works

01:22:14.194 --> 01:22:15.593
I want the whole works

01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:18.422
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises

01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:21.292
Of all shapes and sizes
And now

01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:25.366
Don't care how
I want it now

01:22:26.037 --> 01:22:29.734
Don't care how
I want it now

01:22:38.148 --> 01:22:39.877
She was a bad egg.

01:22:41.384 --> 01:22:42.543
Where's she gone?

01:22:42.818 --> 01:22:45.981
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.

01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:48.213
The garbage chute!

01:22:48.824 --> 01:22:50.189
Where does it lead to?

01:22:50.392 --> 01:22:51.983
To the furnace.

01:22:52.327 --> 01:22:54.158
The furnace?

01:22:54.996 --> 01:22:57.794
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.

01:22:57.999 --> 01:23:00.330
She could be stuck inside the tube.

01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:01.697
Hold on!

01:23:01.902 --> 01:23:03.460
Veruca! Sweetheart!

01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:05.501
Daddy's coming!

01:23:07.974 --> 01:23:10.135
There'll be a lot of garbage today.

01:23:10.343 --> 01:23:13.210
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.

01:23:13.412 --> 01:23:15.972
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.

01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:20.242
Mr. Wonka, they won't really
be burned in the furnace, will they?

01:23:20.919 --> 01:23:23.820
I think that furnace is lit
only every other day.

01:23:24.022 --> 01:23:26.581
So they have a good sporting chance.

01:23:27.358 --> 01:23:30.816
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

01:23:31.028 --> 01:23:34.485
I've got another puzzle for you

01:23:34.697 --> 01:23:37.757
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:41.704
If you are wise you'll listen to me

01:23:41.938 --> 01:23:45.236
Who do you blame
When your kid is a brat

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.739
Pampered and spoiled
Like a Siamese cat

01:23:48.944 --> 01:23:52.174
Blaming the kids
Is a lie and a shame

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.245
You know exactly

01:23:54.448 --> 01:23:56.507
Who's to blame

01:23:57.218 --> 01:23:59.708
The mother and the father

01:24:01.888 --> 01:24:04.118
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

01:24:04.558 --> 01:24:08.016
If you're not spoiled
Then you will go far

01:24:08.228 --> 01:24:12.163
You will live in happiness too

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:17.457
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

01:24:18.903 --> 01:24:21.701
The children are
disappearing like rabbits!

01:24:21.906 --> 01:24:25.034
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?

01:24:25.243 --> 01:24:27.210
Can't we sit down for a minute?

01:24:27.411 --> 01:24:31.575
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.

01:24:36.252 --> 01:24:38.379
Behold the Wonkamobile!

01:24:38.588 --> 01:24:40.556
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. "

01:24:40.756 --> 01:24:43.588
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.

01:24:43.858 --> 01:24:46.383
Grab a seat, they're going fast!

01:24:46.595 --> 01:24:49.063
What's that they're filling it up with?

01:24:49.264 --> 01:24:52.061
Ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles...

01:24:52.266 --> 01:24:55.565
...bubble cola, double cola,
double-bubble burp-a-cola...

01:24:55.769 --> 01:24:58.738
...that carbonated stuff
that tickles your nose.

01:24:58.939 --> 01:25:01.839
Few people realize the power
in one of those things.

01:25:02.108 --> 01:25:03.973
I'm sorry I asked.

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:07.236
Would Slugworth pay extra
to know about this?

01:25:07.447 --> 01:25:10.381
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

01:25:11.883 --> 01:25:13.077
Everybody set?

01:25:13.285 --> 01:25:14.582
Will this go fast?

01:25:14.786 --> 01:25:17.583
It should. It's got more gas
than a politician!

01:25:17.788 --> 01:25:21.724
Hold on. I'm going to open her up
and see what she can do.

01:25:29.799 --> 01:25:31.790
Swifter than eagles...

01:25:32.068 --> 01:25:34.127
...stronger than lions.

01:25:42.077 --> 01:25:43.976
It's getting in my eyes!

01:25:44.412 --> 01:25:46.277
It's seeping in my shoes!

01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:49.143
I'm soaked!
It’ll never come out!

01:25:49.651 --> 01:25:50.982
It's sticking to my gun!

01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:02.928
My dress! My hair! My face!

01:26:03.996 --> 01:26:06.829
I'm sending you
the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!

01:26:09.934 --> 01:26:11.799
I'm dry cleaned!

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.866
Hey, Grandpa...

01:26:17.075 --> 01:26:19.372
...what was that we just went through?

01:26:19.576 --> 01:26:20.941
Hsaw Aknow.

01:26:21.145 --> 01:26:24.114
- Is that Japanese?
- No, Wonka Wash spelled backwards.

01:26:24.314 --> 01:26:26.440
That's it. The journey's over.

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:28.947
Finest bath I've had in twenty years!

01:26:29.152 --> 01:26:30.551
Let's do it again!

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:34.086
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:38.787
If the Lord meant for us to walk
He wouldn't have invented roller-skates.

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:40.791
Would you put these on?

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.260
We have to be careful.

01:26:43.764 --> 01:26:46.096
There's dangerous stuff inside.

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.030
Wonkavision!

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:52.704
My very latest and greatest invention.

01:26:53.273 --> 01:26:55.639
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.

01:26:55.842 --> 01:26:58.902
You all know how
ordinary television works.

01:26:59.112 --> 01:27:01.409
I do! You photograph something...

01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:04.241
...then it's split
into millions of pieces...

01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:08.386
...that fly through the air and arrive
at your TV set in the right order.

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:12.281
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

01:27:12.523 --> 01:27:15.151
If they can do it with a photograph...

01:27:15.359 --> 01:27:17.452
...why not a bar of chocolate?

01:27:20.363 --> 01:27:24.766
I shall now send this chocolate bar
from one end of the room to the other.

01:27:24.968 --> 01:27:28.368
It has to be big, because
when you transmit by television...

01:27:28.637 --> 01:27:30.195
...it always ends up smaller.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.701
Goggles on, please.

01:27:34.877 --> 01:27:36.969
Lights... camera...

01:27:37.178 --> 01:27:38.372
...action!

01:27:40.148 --> 01:27:41.877
You can remove your goggles.

01:27:42.717 --> 01:27:43.944
Where's the chocolate?

01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:46.381
It's flying over our heads
in a million pieces.

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:50.884
Now watch the screen.

01:27:53.726 --> 01:27:55.057
Here it comes.

01:27:56.329 --> 01:27:57.796
There it is.

01:27:58.164 --> 01:27:59.153
Take it.

01:27:59.432 --> 01:28:01.023
How? It's just a picture.

01:28:01.233 --> 01:28:02.564
All right, you take it.

01:28:04.002 --> 01:28:04.866
It's real!

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.968
Taste it!

01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:08.071
It's just gotten smaller.

01:28:10.407 --> 01:28:11.374
It's perfect!

01:28:11.575 --> 01:28:12.542
Unbelievable!

01:28:12.743 --> 01:28:13.471
A miracle!

01:28:13.677 --> 01:28:14.541
A TV dinner!

01:28:14.745 --> 01:28:15.541
It's Wonkavision.

01:28:15.746 --> 01:28:17.213
It could change the world!

01:28:17.414 --> 01:28:19.210
Can you send other things?

01:28:19.415 --> 01:28:21.474
- Not just chocolate.
- Anything you like.

01:28:21.684 --> 01:28:23.015
What about people?

01:28:23.253 --> 01:28:24.686
People?

01:28:26.089 --> 01:28:28.818
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

01:28:29.024 --> 01:28:32.050
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

01:28:32.261 --> 01:28:33.888
But it might have messy results.

01:28:34.096 --> 01:28:37.326
I'm going to be the first person
to be sent by television!

01:28:37.532 --> 01:28:38.590
Get away!

01:28:38.933 --> 01:28:40.230
Stop. Don't. Come back.

01:28:40.434 --> 01:28:42.095
Lights... camera... action!

01:28:46.206 --> 01:28:47.571
Where are you?

01:28:47.774 --> 01:28:50.004
He's up there, in a million pieces.

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:53.770
- Mike, are you there?
- No good shouting. Watch the screen.

01:28:56.949 --> 01:28:59.247
Mike? Why is he taking so long?

01:28:59.451 --> 01:29:01.509
A million pieces
take time to put together.

01:29:01.719 --> 01:29:04.415
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.

01:29:04.622 --> 01:29:07.386
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...

01:29:08.226 --> 01:29:10.318
The little groover's getting smaller.

01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:14.759
Look at me! I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

01:29:15.532 --> 01:29:17.932
Wow, what a wild trip that was!

01:29:18.135 --> 01:29:20.694
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened!

01:29:20.903 --> 01:29:24.066
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.608
Great. He's completely unharmed.

01:29:26.809 --> 01:29:28.935
You call that unharmed?!

01:29:29.144 --> 01:29:32.113
Wow! That was something!
Can I do it again?

01:29:32.781 --> 01:29:33.941
There'll be nothing!

01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:36.275
Don't worry, Mom.
I feel fine.

01:29:36.483 --> 01:29:38.451
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!

01:29:38.652 --> 01:29:40.711
Wait till the kids hear!

01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:42.218
No one will hear!

01:29:42.423 --> 01:29:43.856
Where are you taking me?

01:29:44.091 --> 01:29:45.557
I don't want to go in there!

01:29:45.758 --> 01:29:46.986
Be quiet!

01:29:47.327 --> 01:29:48.419
Well?

01:29:49.095 --> 01:29:52.792
Fortunately, small boys
are extremely springy and elastic.

01:29:52.998 --> 01:29:56.798
So, I think we'll put him in my
special taffy-pulling machine.

01:29:57.002 --> 01:29:58.560
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.

01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:02.535
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be careful.

01:30:04.508 --> 01:30:06.442
What's he saying?

01:30:06.677 --> 01:30:09.271
No, I won't hold you responsible.

01:30:10.513 --> 01:30:14.244
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say good-bye.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.248
No, no! Don't speak!

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:20.684
For some moments in life,
there are no words. Run along now.

01:30:27.196 --> 01:30:28.025
Adieu.

01:30:29.697 --> 01:30:32.359
"Parting is such sweet sorrow. "

01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:44.367
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

01:30:44.977 --> 01:30:47.810
I've got another puzzle for you

01:30:48.514 --> 01:30:51.176
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

01:30:52.184 --> 01:30:54.845
If you are wise you'll listen to me

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.416
What do you get from a glut of TV?

01:30:58.623 --> 01:31:01.854
A pain in the neck and an IQ of 3

01:31:02.359 --> 01:31:05.351
Why don't you try simply reading a book?

01:31:05.863 --> 01:31:08.423
Or could you just not bear to look?

01:31:08.632 --> 01:31:10.122
You'll get no

01:31:13.202 --> 01:31:15.796
You'll get no commercials

01:31:16.205 --> 01:31:19.867
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:23.371
If you like reading you will go far

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:27.475
You will live in happiness too

01:31:28.549 --> 01:31:29.811
Like the...

01:31:30.217 --> 01:31:31.377
...Oompa...

01:31:32.219 --> 01:31:34.983
...Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do!

01:31:38.925 --> 01:31:43.362
So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.

01:31:43.863 --> 01:31:46.353
I must answer that note from the queen.

01:31:47.199 --> 01:31:49.326
What will happen to the others?

01:31:50.936 --> 01:31:51.960
My dear boy...

01:31:52.204 --> 01:31:54.228
...they'll be quite all right.

01:31:54.439 --> 01:31:59.376
When they leave here they'll be restored
to their normal, terrible old selves.

01:31:59.944 --> 01:32:02.571
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.

01:32:02.779 --> 01:32:04.246
Don't worry.

01:32:04.448 --> 01:32:06.882
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

01:32:07.284 --> 01:32:11.515
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

01:32:11.721 --> 01:32:13.586
Up the stairs. I'm busy.

01:32:13.789 --> 01:32:16.724
A whole day wasted.
Good-bye to you both.

01:32:20.295 --> 01:32:23.787
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

01:32:24.065 --> 01:32:25.965
I don't know, Charlie.

01:32:26.568 --> 01:32:28.626
But I'm going to find out.

01:32:46.985 --> 01:32:49.283
I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

01:32:49.488 --> 01:32:51.979
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.

01:32:52.424 --> 01:32:55.824
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.

01:32:56.327 --> 01:32:57.794
When does he get it?

01:32:57.995 --> 01:33:00.122
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:02.458
Because he broke the rules.

01:33:02.665 --> 01:33:05.463
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?

01:33:05.668 --> 01:33:07.727
Wrong, sir! Wrong!

01:33:07.937 --> 01:33:11.394
Under Section 37-B of the
contract signed by him...

01:33:11.607 --> 01:33:15.668
...it states clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if...

01:33:15.944 --> 01:33:18.913
...and you can read it
for yourself in this copy:

01:33:19.114 --> 01:33:20.580
"I, the undersigned...

01:33:20.782 --> 01:33:23.649
"... shall forfeit all rights,
privileges and licenses...

01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:25.978
"... herein contained," et cetera...

01:33:26.187 --> 01:33:27.154
"... fax mentis...

01:33:27.355 --> 01:33:30.323
"... incendium gloria culpam,"
et cetera, et cetera.

01:33:30.524 --> 01:33:33.152
"Memo bis punitor della cattum!"

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.659
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!

01:33:36.863 --> 01:33:39.092
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!

01:33:39.298 --> 01:33:42.927
You bumped into the ceiling
which now has to be sterilized!

01:33:43.135 --> 01:33:45.160
So you get nothing!

01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:46.667
You lose!

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:49.032
Good day, sir!

01:33:49.808 --> 01:33:51.207
You're a crook!

01:33:51.643 --> 01:33:54.338
A cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are!

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:56.513
How can you do this?!

01:33:56.713 --> 01:34:00.342
Build up a little boy's hopes and
then smash his dreams to pieces!

01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:02.348
You're an inhuman monster!

01:34:02.553 --> 01:34:04.816
I said, "Good day"!

01:34:08.558 --> 01:34:11.049
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.

01:34:11.726 --> 01:34:14.354
I'll get even,
if it's the last thing I do.

01:34:14.563 --> 01:34:17.498
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.

01:34:50.361 --> 01:34:52.886
"So shines a good deed...

01:34:53.097 --> 01:34:55.428
"... in a weary world. "

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.029
My boy.

01:35:01.705 --> 01:35:03.002
You've won!

01:35:03.205 --> 01:35:05.070
You did it! You did it!

01:35:05.274 --> 01:35:08.539
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!

01:35:09.778 --> 01:35:12.575
Forgive me for putting you through this.

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.908
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

01:35:16.117 --> 01:35:17.345
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

01:35:17.552 --> 01:35:20.077
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!

01:35:20.288 --> 01:35:22.585
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

01:35:22.789 --> 01:35:25.781
And you passed the test.
You won!

01:35:26.059 --> 01:35:28.186
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!

01:35:28.395 --> 01:35:31.022
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?

01:35:31.230 --> 01:35:34.597
The chocolate, yes.
But, that's just the beginning!

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.257
We have so much time
and so little to do!

01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:40.370
Strike that. Reverse it.

01:35:40.572 --> 01:35:42.335
This way, please!

01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:44.800
We'll take the Wonkavator.

01:35:45.577 --> 01:35:48.067
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

01:35:55.919 --> 01:35:59.878
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

01:36:00.089 --> 01:36:02.455
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.

01:36:02.659 --> 01:36:05.786
But the Wonkavator goes
sideways, slantways, backways...

01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:07.291
And frontways?

01:36:07.496 --> 01:36:09.464
...and any ways you can think of.

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:14.297
It can take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:17.164
Press a button and zing!
You're off.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:20.430
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.273
Except one.

01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.973
This one.

01:36:25.345 --> 01:36:26.744
Go ahead, Charlie.

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:28.175
Me?

01:36:30.849 --> 01:36:32.111
There it goes!

01:36:34.286 --> 01:36:35.617
Hold on tight!

01:36:36.121 --> 01:36:38.953
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.

01:36:39.691 --> 01:36:43.149
Faster! If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.

01:36:43.361 --> 01:36:44.794
Through what?

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:47.494
- You mean, we're going..?
- Up and out.

01:36:47.698 --> 01:36:50.633
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1,000 pieces!

01:36:50.867 --> 01:36:53.301
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

01:36:57.039 --> 01:36:58.700
Hold on, everybody!

01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:02.241
Here it comes!

01:37:17.324 --> 01:37:21.157
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.

01:37:21.894 --> 01:37:23.521
Our town looks so pretty.

01:37:23.730 --> 01:37:25.027
Look over here, Charlie.

01:37:25.231 --> 01:37:26.892
I think I see our house.

01:37:29.235 --> 01:37:30.633
It really looks beautiful.

01:37:30.836 --> 01:37:32.360
There's my school!

01:37:38.909 --> 01:37:41.002
How did you like the chocolate factory?

01:37:41.345 --> 01:37:44.143
It's the most wonderful place
in the world.

01:37:44.348 --> 01:37:46.373
I'm pleased to hear you say that...

01:37:46.584 --> 01:37:48.881
...because I'm giving it to you.

01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:52.318
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?

01:37:52.522 --> 01:37:55.184
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.

01:37:55.425 --> 01:37:57.449
And I don't really want to try.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.697
Who can I trust to run the factory, and
take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

01:38:02.931 --> 01:38:04.227
Not a grown-up.

01:38:04.432 --> 01:38:07.595
A grown-up would do
everything his way, not mine.

01:38:07.935 --> 01:38:11.564
That's why I decided long ago
that I had to find a child.

01:38:11.773 --> 01:38:13.433
A very honest...

01:38:13.774 --> 01:38:15.207
...loving child...

01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:19.076
...to whom I can tell all my
precious candy-making secrets.

01:38:19.279 --> 01:38:21.803
- That's why you sent the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.

01:38:22.048 --> 01:38:24.539
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.

01:38:24.784 --> 01:38:26.775
- And me?
- Absolutely.

01:38:27.219 --> 01:38:29.414
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.

01:38:29.622 --> 01:38:31.452
I want you to bring them all.

01:38:35.126 --> 01:38:36.559
But Charlie...

01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:41.425
...don't forget what happened to the man
who got everything he wanted.

01:38:41.632 --> 01:38:42.690
What happened?

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.232
He lived happily ever after.
