06:20.714 --> 06:23.508
We'll finally see

06:20.714 --> 06:23.508
what that Taurus can do.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.261
Deej, first let's discuss

06:23.550 --> 06:26.261
what the Taurus cannot do.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.515
Michelle, trust me.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.515
It's okay.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.643
Check near the garbage.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.643
See if the goat boy is there.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.438
Sweetheart, Michelle.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.734
Come here.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.734
We talked about this.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.528
I told you,

06:40.775 --> 06:43.528
there is no goat boy.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.990
It's just a person in a costume.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.990
It's like on Halloween.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.617
You mean, he's coming

06:47.032 --> 06:49.617
here to trick or treat?

06:51.036 --> 06:53.538
Dad, let me take

06:51.036 --> 06:53.538
a crack at this.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.999
Michelle, the goat boy

06:53.580 --> 06:55.999
can never get out of Norway

06:56.041 --> 06:58.752
because goats can't

06:56.041 --> 06:58.752
ride on planes.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.088
- Why not?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.088
- Well..

07:01.129 --> 07:03.048
They can never get through

07:01.129 --> 07:03.048
the metal detector

07:03.090 --> 07:05.175
after eating all

07:03.090 --> 07:05.175
those tin cans.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.555
Oh. Why didn't you tell me

07:07.344 --> 07:10.555
that in the first place?

07:14.475 --> 07:15.685
When you get on that ice

07:15.727 --> 07:17.771
you gotta destroy that punk.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.980
Uh, Jess, I've

07:17.812 --> 07:18.980
been thinking about it.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.233
I'm not even

07:19.022 --> 07:21.233
gonna play the game.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.235
What?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.404
You guys should have heard, this

07:23.277 --> 07:25.404
guy comes down to the station

07:25.445 --> 07:27.322
dumps all over Joey

07:25.445 --> 07:27.322
about this hockey game

07:27.364 --> 07:28.782
and Joey just sits

07:27.364 --> 07:28.782
there and takes it.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.284
Yeah, I know,

07:28.823 --> 07:30.284
I heard, but you know

07:30.325 --> 07:31.826
everyone has their own way

07:30.325 --> 07:31.826
of handling things

07:31.868 --> 07:33.536
and Joey's not the

07:31.868 --> 07:33.536
confrontational type

07:33.578 --> 07:35.080
and we should respect there.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.831
I mean, like last night

07:35.122 --> 07:36.831
when we were out to dinner

07:36.873 --> 07:38.499
and you got that

07:36.873 --> 07:38.499
bug in your salad

07:38.541 --> 07:41.502
you didn't make a big fuss,

07:38.541 --> 07:41.502
you just went on eating.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.841
Bug? I thought

07:44.214 --> 07:46.841
it was a bacon bit.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.722
It just kills me that you won't

07:49.552 --> 07:52.722
stand up to this Stonewall guy.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.308
Stonewall?

07:54.349 --> 07:56.143
That goalie from college

07:54.349 --> 07:56.143
who totally humiliate..

07:58.061 --> 08:00.897
So you saw old Stonewall.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.066
Look, let's just forget

08:00.939 --> 08:03.066
about it, okay?

08:03.108 --> 08:07.112
It was a meaningless game

08:03.108 --> 08:07.112
that happened 15 years ago.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.281
- Bread, Joey?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.281
- I'm not hungry, Steph.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.991
Come on, Joey, don't

08:09.323 --> 08:10.991
you want another chance

08:11.032 --> 08:13.118
to get out on the ice

08:11.032 --> 08:13.118
and score the winning goal

08:13.160 --> 08:14.535
against that loudmouth?

08:14.577 --> 08:15.745
Yeah, of course,

08:14.577 --> 08:15.745
I would.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.538
So, do it.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.538
What's your problem?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.333
Look, I'm not playing

08:17.580 --> 08:19.333
in this game.

08:19.374 --> 08:23.170
This whole thing is turning

08:19.374 --> 08:23.170
into one big grudge match.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.629
I don't get you, man.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.589
If I were you, I'd wipe

08:24.671 --> 08:26.589
the ice with that guy.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.094
Okay, I'll admit it.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.763
I don't want to

08:31.136 --> 08:33.763
face Binkley again.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.223
When I was in college,

08:33.805 --> 08:35.223
he embarrassed me

08:35.265 --> 08:37.142
in front of all my friends

08:35.265 --> 08:37.142
and my family.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.935
I don't need to go

08:37.184 --> 08:38.935
through that again.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.355
Well, you shouldn't have to.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.982
Come on, Jess. If he doesn't

08:41.396 --> 08:43.982
wanna play, it's his choice.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.194
You're right.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.194
I'm sorry, pal.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.903
I got an idea,

08:47.235 --> 08:48.903
why don't we

08:48.945 --> 08:50.571
just go to the ice skating

08:48.945 --> 08:50.571
rink tomorrow

08:50.613 --> 08:53.241
and just skate for the fun

08:50.613 --> 08:53.241
of it like we used to?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.951
Yeah. That's

08:53.283 --> 08:54.951
a really good idea.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.619
Okay. What

08:54.993 --> 08:56.619
do you say, Joey?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.079
I say fine.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.290
Why don't you, uh, why don't

08:58.121 --> 09:00.290
you pass me the bread?

09:00.332 --> 09:04.211
And, uh, casserole,

09:00.332 --> 09:04.211
a little salad, please.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.587
Thank you, thank you.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.587
Keep it coming.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.715
[instrumental music]

09:13.512 --> 09:15.889
[instrumental music]

09:32.113 --> 09:33.573
It's okay.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
Uncle Jesse, come on.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.500
Yeah, get out here.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.751
Come on. You're missing

09:43.542 --> 09:44.751
all the fun.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.961
It's so easy.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.422
Just don't let go.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.799
It's okay guys. I'm just-just

09:49.839 --> 09:51.799
warming up a bit.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.468
Go ahead. Go have fun.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.468
Go, go, go.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.053
- Alright.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.053
- Don't worry about me.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.933
Come on, Michelle.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.933
Don't be scared.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.227
- Got her, Steph?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.227
- Yeah.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.270
Okay, now..

10:03.311 --> 10:06.147
...try to do

10:03.311 --> 10:06.147
what I do, okay?

10:06.189 --> 10:09.150
What the h-heck

10:06.189 --> 10:09.150
are you doing?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.152
[laughing]

10:15.282 --> 10:16.783
Hey. How's it going?

10:16.824 --> 10:20.161
I'm fine. I'm just

10:16.824 --> 10:20.161
warming up a little.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.913
- So?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.913
- I feel like an idiot.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.249
Why, 'cause you're dressed

10:21.955 --> 10:24.249
for hoodlums on ice?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.293
No, 'cause I haven't done

10:24.291 --> 10:26.293
this since I was a kid.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.337
Yeah, I know how it feel. It's

10:26.334 --> 10:29.337
been a long time for me, too.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.465
Hope I'm not rusty out there.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.465
See, you in a little bit.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.427
[instrumental music]

10:36.677 --> 10:37.971
Yeah, here we go.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.514
Ooh.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.061
[sighs]

10:42.476 --> 10:45.061
Man.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.315
- Real rusty, twinkle toes.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.315
- Yeah, I know.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.150
Hardly got any height

10:48.356 --> 10:50.150
on that double axle.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.445
(Joey)

10:51.443 --> 10:53.445
'Hey, guys.'

10:53.487 --> 10:56.531
Okay, everybody, it's time

10:53.487 --> 10:56.531
for crack the whip.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.951
- Crack the what?

10:56.573 --> 10:59.951
- 'You're not scared, are you?'

10:59.993 --> 11:02.078
- Scared?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.078
- 'Come on, let's go.'

11:02.120 --> 11:04.247
- Alright. Let's go.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.247
- Okay, hold hands, everybody.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.125
- Cracking the whip.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.125
- Okay, let's go.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.668
- Ha ha ha!

11:07.167 --> 11:08.668
- Okay.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.044
Aah!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.380
[screaming]

11:14.757 --> 11:16.009
[screams]

11:16.050 --> 11:19.262
Isn't this fun, Jess? Jess?

11:19.304 --> 11:21.598
Where are the brakes

11:19.304 --> 11:21.598
on these things?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.225
Ow.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.104
I think we might've

11:26.394 --> 11:28.104
put a little too much

11:28.146 --> 11:29.856
crack in that whip.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.358
Let's go, you guys.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.197
Just tell me one thing.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.032
My hair messed up?

11:39.073 --> 11:42.076
No, but the rest of you

11:39.073 --> 11:42.076
is kind of bent.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.208
Hey, Gladstone. How's

11:44.454 --> 11:48.208
America's worst hockey player?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.751
I heard you dropped out

11:48.249 --> 11:50.751
of the game. Smart move.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.380
You know, you should've

11:50.793 --> 11:53.380
tried that 15 years ago.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.465
You might've saved yourself

11:53.421 --> 11:55.465
some embarrassment.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.925
Alright. That's it.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.925
That's it!

12:03.515 --> 12:06.643
If I could get up,

12:03.515 --> 12:06.643
you'd be in big trouble.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.478
Hey, Blinkley,

12:06.685 --> 12:08.478
is your life so pathetic

12:08.520 --> 12:10.104
and empty that you have to

12:08.520 --> 12:10.104
live in the past?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.814
Well..

12:11.856 --> 12:13.274
...yeah.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.317
That's why I was

12:13.316 --> 12:14.317
looking forward

12:14.359 --> 12:16.319
to humiliating

12:14.359 --> 12:16.319
Gladstone again.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.738
I could live off that

12:16.361 --> 12:19.738
for another 15 years.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.075
Okay, I've had it,

12:19.780 --> 12:22.075
this has been eating me up

12:22.116 --> 12:23.326
inside for too long.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.286
Binkley, Saturday afternoon

12:25.328 --> 12:27.914
this is you!

12:27.955 --> 12:29.374
[laughs]

12:32.293 --> 12:35.213
[dramatic music]

12:37.716 --> 12:38.841
[instrumental music]

12:40.427 --> 12:43.054
This is great, I can't believe

12:40.427 --> 12:43.054
you're actually letting me

12:43.096 --> 12:44.556
drive to the hockey game

12:43.096 --> 12:44.556
on the freeway.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.141
And I have total confidence

12:44.598 --> 12:47.141
in you, sweetheart.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.103
But first let's just discuss

12:47.183 --> 12:50.103
the different lanes once more.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.145
[sighs]

12:50.144 --> 12:51.145
Dad.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.314
Oh, come on.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.314
It'll be fun.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.066
Now, what do you call

12:53.356 --> 12:55.066
the far left lane?

12:55.108 --> 12:58.737
The entirely

12:55.108 --> 12:58.737
too fast lane.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.154
Good. Now, see?

12:58.777 --> 13:00.154
This isn't so difficult.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.239
What do you call

13:00.196 --> 13:01.239
the middle lane?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.242
The still much

13:01.281 --> 13:04.242
too fast lane.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.663
Excellent. And now, what do we

13:04.284 --> 13:08.663
call the far right lane?

13:08.705 --> 13:11.374
The geeks and nerds lane?

13:11.416 --> 13:12.875
D.J., if you want we can

13:11.416 --> 13:12.875
go right back out there

13:12.917 --> 13:14.419
and just drive around

13:12.917 --> 13:14.419
the block again.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.088
Hey, I'm a geek, I'm a nerd.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.088
Give me the keys.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.674
[knock on door]

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
- Hi, Steve.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
- Hey.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.470
Hey, Steve, you know,

13:22.218 --> 13:23.470
we gotta go.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.263
Could you excuse us

13:23.511 --> 13:25.263
for a second?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.181
The refrigerator is right

13:25.305 --> 13:27.181
where you left it this morning.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.601
Actually, Mr. Tanner, I know

13:27.223 --> 13:29.601
you're finally letting

13:29.643 --> 13:31.936
D.J. drive on the freeway,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.936
and I wanted to be there

13:31.978 --> 13:34.522
for her first merge.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.483
Isn't he romantic?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.528
Hey, no merging

13:37.984 --> 13:40.528
in my kitchen.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.447
Steve, you know if you want you

13:40.570 --> 13:42.447
can just run alongside the car?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.031
Would you mind doing that?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.619
"When a minor penalty

13:47.661 --> 13:51.748
"is assessed to a

13:47.661 --> 13:51.748
goaltender, the.."

13:51.790 --> 13:53.166
Guys.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.251
I'm trying to study

13:53.207 --> 13:55.251
the rules of hockey.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.211
I have to announce the game.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.172
You want your old man

13:57.253 --> 13:59.172
to look like an idiot?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.509
I guess you do.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.346
Okay, Kimmy, feed

14:04.010 --> 14:06.346
the boys around 3:00

14:06.387 --> 14:07.639
and we should be home

14:06.387 --> 14:07.639
about 5:00.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.265
Any questions?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.393
Yes. My usual rate

14:09.307 --> 14:12.393
is five bucks an hour.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.520
But you have twins.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.854
So, shouldn't I get ten?

14:15.896 --> 14:19.442
Okay, Kimmy, I'll give you ten,

14:15.896 --> 14:19.442
but you pay for your own food.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.402
Five works for me.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.112
Listen guys, you keep

14:21.444 --> 14:23.112
an eye on her.

14:23.154 --> 14:26.324
If she gets near my hair care

14:23.154 --> 14:26.324
center, bite her ankles.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.456
Hey, half pints.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.999
Hey, half wit.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.462
So, kid, still hiding

14:37.168 --> 14:39.462
from the goat boy?

14:39.504 --> 14:42.006
There's no such thing

14:39.504 --> 14:42.006
as goat boys

14:42.048 --> 14:45.176
if you wanna know.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.762
Okay, but check this out.

14:47.804 --> 14:52.141
Half man, half dog,

14:47.804 --> 14:52.141
The Muttman.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.685
No!

14:56.270 --> 14:59.148
He chases cars

14:56.270 --> 14:59.148
and drives away in them?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.110
What if he drives

15:00.400 --> 15:03.110
to our house?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.404
Steph, give me that.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.988
Michelle, there's no such thing

15:06.030 --> 15:08.282
as a half man, half dog.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.910
Grrr! I am psyched

15:08.324 --> 15:10.910
for this game.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.662
I'm going to rip off

15:10.951 --> 15:12.662
Binkley's head

15:12.704 --> 15:14.622
chew him up,

15:12.704 --> 15:14.622
and spit him out.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.334
- Grrr.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.334
- Oh, mama!

15:20.628 --> 15:21.921
Michelle!

15:21.962 --> 15:23.381
What did I say?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.886
Michelle!

15:27.927 --> 15:30.430
Hey, Comet, have you

15:27.927 --> 15:30.430
seen Michelle?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
Okay. I'm right

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
behind you.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.815
Michelle, I'm not

15:38.855 --> 15:40.815
The Muttman.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.150
Yes, you are.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.150
I see your paws.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.323
Michelle, that's Comet.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.118
Comet, can we

15:49.365 --> 15:52.118
be alone, please?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.745
There's a "Lassie" rerun on.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.539
[barks]

16:00.835 --> 16:03.045
Michelle, I'm not a dog.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.547
Can you please come out?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.676
Okay.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.595
But how come you were growling

16:10.637 --> 16:13.681
and saying mean things?

16:13.723 --> 16:16.643
Well, Michelle, that's

16:13.723 --> 16:16.643
a big part of playing sports.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.186
It's called

16:16.684 --> 16:19.186
being competitive.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.522
You see, you just pretend

16:19.228 --> 16:21.522
that you're mean and scary

16:21.564 --> 16:24.275
so the players in the other

16:21.564 --> 16:24.275
team will be afraid of you.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.569
Well, you're doing

16:24.317 --> 16:26.569
a good job

16:26.611 --> 16:28.696
because I'm afraid.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.157
I like it better

16:28.738 --> 16:31.157
when you're nice.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.535
I like it better

16:32.533 --> 16:34.535
when I'm nice, too.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.747
I promise I won't be mean

16:34.577 --> 16:37.747
and scary ever again.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.374
- Really?

16:37.789 --> 16:40.374
- 'Absolutely.'

16:40.416 --> 16:41.918
Come here.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.671
Attagirl.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.426
Hey, you know me.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.426
I'd never hurt a fly.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.846
You know your old buddy

16:50.468 --> 16:52.846
Kermit, the frog

16:52.887 --> 16:55.431
"I'd never hurt a fly

16:52.887 --> 16:55.431
I might eat one now and then

16:55.473 --> 16:57.224
"but I'd never hurt one.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.644
"So, what do you say,

16:57.266 --> 16:59.644
let's hop to it, Miss Piggy?"

16:59.686 --> 17:02.814
Okay, Kermie,

16:59.686 --> 17:02.814
you're my hero.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.649
That's a really good piggy.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.526
Yeah. Ahem.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.526
Whoops!

17:06.567 --> 17:09.028
I've got a frog

17:06.567 --> 17:09.028
in my throat.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.446
Yeah..

17:10.488 --> 17:12.573
[instrumental music]

17:14.325 --> 17:16.369
[crowd cheering]

17:21.207 --> 17:23.793
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.793
- Yay.

17:23.835 --> 17:28.756
Alright. Here we are in the

17:23.835 --> 17:28.756
second quarter...period, uh..

17:28.798 --> 17:30.842
...third...some hunk

17:28.798 --> 17:30.842
of the game and, uh..

17:30.884 --> 17:33.219
...but I do know

17:30.884 --> 17:33.219
the score's, um..

17:35.054 --> 17:36.806
'Four-four. The score's

17:35.054 --> 17:36.806
four-four here today'

17:36.848 --> 17:40.142
'and the big guys are out there

17:36.848 --> 17:40.142
hitting the sticks around.'

17:40.184 --> 17:42.020
They're smacking the, um..

17:44.063 --> 17:45.398
...puck. They're hitting

17:44.063 --> 17:45.398
the puck around.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.816
It's really fantastic.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.443
I-I wish you guys

17:46.858 --> 17:49.443
were down here because, uh..

17:49.485 --> 17:50.695
...maybe you could explain

17:49.485 --> 17:50.695
it to me..

17:50.737 --> 17:52.238
...because I don't..

17:54.448 --> 17:57.451
- Whoa.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.451
- 'Oh! Did you see that?'

17:57.493 --> 17:59.370
'Blinkley pushed

17:57.493 --> 17:59.370
down Gladstone.'

18:01.622 --> 18:03.041
'Binkley's gonna get it now.'

18:03.082 --> 18:05.001
'Gladstone's gonna give it

18:03.082 --> 18:05.001
to him any second.'

18:06.627 --> 18:08.337
'Uh, maybe not.'

18:08.379 --> 18:11.049
'It-It looked like Gladstone

18:08.379 --> 18:11.049
was gonna give it to Blinkley.'

18:13.801 --> 18:16.930
I wonder if fighting

18:13.801 --> 18:16.930
is allowed in hockey.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.306
Hey, Jess, do you need any

18:16.971 --> 18:19.306
help with the play by play?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.059
- From you?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.059
- Come on, Jess.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.351
You don't even know

18:21.100 --> 18:22.351
what color the blue line is.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.228
I do, too.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.230
It's blue, right?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.024
Okay, Burkhart clears

18:26.272 --> 18:28.024
it to the center

18:28.066 --> 18:29.984
where it's picked up by

18:28.066 --> 18:29.984
Burswood's who's pole-checked

18:30.026 --> 18:31.694
by Guiles who takes

18:30.026 --> 18:31.694
the puck the other away.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.905
Aren't you glad I grew up with

18:31.736 --> 18:33.905
five hockey-crazed brothers.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.407
He breaks away from the defense

18:33.947 --> 18:36.407
man, shoots from the corner..

18:36.449 --> 18:37.909
It's saved by Binkley

18:37.951 --> 18:40.202
who quickly slides the

18:37.951 --> 18:40.202
puck into the corner.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.790
My wife.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.380
Where have you been?

18:51.422 --> 18:54.092
On the side of the road,

18:51.422 --> 18:54.092
talking to the highway patrol.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.554
You got a speeding ticket your

18:54.133 --> 18:58.554
first time on the freeway? Cool!

18:58.596 --> 19:02.767
Not that cool. I got a ticket

18:58.596 --> 19:02.767
for driving too slow.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.938
I was clocked

19:02.809 --> 19:06.938
doing 23 in a 55.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.188
Hey, that cop

19:06.980 --> 19:08.188
was way off.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.649
You were doing

19:08.230 --> 19:09.649
at least 32.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.026
Hey, that's right 'cause

19:09.690 --> 19:12.026
you started hyperventilating

19:12.068 --> 19:14.779
as soon as she hit 30.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.781
I wonder how Joey's doing.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.997
[whistle blows]

19:24.038 --> 19:25.539
(Jesse)

19:24.038 --> 19:25.539
'I don't know much

19:24.038 --> 19:25.539
about hockey'

19:25.581 --> 19:27.625
'but I sure know

19:25.581 --> 19:27.625
Joey ain't playing it.'

19:27.667 --> 19:29.002
[buzzer buzzing]

19:29.043 --> 19:30.920
Someone pulled

19:29.043 --> 19:30.920
a fire alarm again?

19:30.962 --> 19:32.379
No. That's the end

19:30.962 --> 19:32.379
of the second period

19:32.421 --> 19:34.048
and the score is four-four.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.591
That's a tie.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.809
How's it going, Joey?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.978
Michelle, haven't you

19:44.851 --> 19:46.978
been watching the game?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.771
I'm not playing very well.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.316
I know. I didn't

19:48.813 --> 19:52.316
wanna mention it.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.695
Remember how we agreed that it's

19:52.358 --> 19:55.695
wrong to play like a meanie?

19:55.736 --> 19:56.988
Yeah.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.990
It's also wrong

19:57.030 --> 19:58.990
to play like a weenie.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.577
Michelle, hockey's

20:00.366 --> 20:03.577
like anything else.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.371
You play your best

20:03.619 --> 20:05.371
when you find something

20:05.412 --> 20:07.915
in the middle of being

20:05.412 --> 20:07.915
a meanie and a weenie.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.711
So would it be okay if I play

20:07.957 --> 20:11.711
like an in-betweenie?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.630
Call it whatever you want,

20:11.752 --> 20:14.630
but just play better.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.759
Okay, pal.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.759
This one's for you.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.720
Alright.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.138
For good luck, right?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.391
Okay, I'll get him.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.309
(Rebecca)

20:25.432 --> 20:27.309
'Well, this third period's

20:25.432 --> 20:27.309
almost over'

20:27.351 --> 20:29.145
'and the score is still

20:27.351 --> 20:29.145
four to four.'

20:29.187 --> 20:31.230
'But the big news

20:29.187 --> 20:31.230
is something amazing'

20:31.271 --> 20:33.191
has happened

20:31.271 --> 20:33.191
to Joey Gladstone.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.068
You are correct, Becky.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
What-what amazing

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
has happened to him?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.279
Well, Jess, he's stick

20:37.195 --> 20:39.279
handling beautifully.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.990
- Right.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.990
- Making crisp passes.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.159
- Hard, clean shots.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.159
- Yes. I thought so.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.785
Whoa! Look at that!

20:44.827 --> 20:47.663
'Gladstone skates past the

20:44.827 --> 20:47.663
defense, and he's in the clear.'

20:47.705 --> 20:49.999
'There's five seconds left.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.999
He's got a break-away!'

20:50.041 --> 20:53.544
'It's just Gladstone

20:50.041 --> 20:53.544
and Binkley.'

20:53.586 --> 20:56.964
'Joey's pulled down and the shot

20:53.586 --> 20:56.964
is saved by Stonewall.'

20:59.842 --> 21:01.468
Way to go, Gladstone.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.595
(Jesse)

21:01.510 --> 21:02.595
'I know what that means.
