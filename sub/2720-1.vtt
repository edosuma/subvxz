00:46.413 --> 00:48.472
The year this story takes place

00:48.515 --> 00:51.040
is the year nearly everything
happened to me.

00:59.292 --> 01:02.455
It was the year I moved from the city
to a backwards hick town

01:02.495 --> 01:04.486
to finish high school.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.496
It was the year an industrial fire

01:14.541 --> 01:16.600
wouldn't stop burning
just outside of town...

01:16.643 --> 01:19.612
In other news,
the industrial fire continues to rage...

01:19.646 --> 01:21.739
The year my dad
first discovered an itch

01:21.781 --> 01:23.840
that much later became cancer,

01:23.883 --> 01:26.750
and later still took all his hair
and then his life.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.249
It was the year
a serial killer wearing a white suit

01:33.293 --> 01:37.286
roamed the county, leaving pretty
young kids dead in his wake.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.371
But mostly it was the year
where I tried

01:49.409 --> 01:51.570
to become
someone else for a while

01:51.611 --> 01:56.014
and for the first time
I went crazy insane for love.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.507
And it seemed like the whole world
was about to end.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.076
But in the beginning

02:01.121 --> 02:03.385
I didn't see any of this
in my future.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.220
I just crossed an X on my calendar

02:05.258 --> 02:08.227
and suddenly I was once again
the new girl at a new school

02:08.261 --> 02:10.320
where no one would talk to me.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.237
Whoa. You have
anything metal on you?

02:25.278 --> 02:27.075
I don't think so.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.104
Well, you must.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.012
What's this?

02:32.051 --> 02:34.212
A bowling ball.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.323
Mine now.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.860
Have you ever entered a room

02:44.898 --> 02:47.230
where you just knew
everyone hated you?

02:47.267 --> 02:49.929
Now multiply that
by roughly a million

02:49.969 --> 02:52.597
and you'll understand
my high school experience.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.301
When I know people hate me,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.775
instead of trying
to change their minds,

02:57.810 --> 02:59.835
I get defensive and weird

02:59.879 --> 03:02.541
and become the exact girl
they think I am.

03:02.582 --> 03:06.279
But this school wasn't just
mean and gossipy.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.152
It was full-on scary.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.989
To give you an idea,
let me tell you the legend of Laura Lee.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.896
Is it -5?

03:19.465 --> 03:21.592
Laura Lee was a student at our school

03:21.634 --> 03:23.465
who danced nights
at a strip club.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.202
Nobody talked to her,
but the entire football team

03:32.245 --> 03:34.213
would heat up coins
with butane lighters

03:34.247 --> 03:37.114
and flick them at her
as she walked through the hallways.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.880
Burning currency
bounced off her like hail.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.726
But what's amazing
is that this poor girl's

03:56.769 --> 03:59.101
attendance record was perfect.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.471
I mean, here she is
dancing every night until 2:00 or later

04:02.508 --> 04:04.305
and dodging fiery coins

04:04.344 --> 04:06.505
and still she makes it
to twice as many classes

04:06.546 --> 04:08.673
as most people.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.649
This is full-on triumph
of the human spirit,

04:10.683 --> 04:12.446
but you never see
this shit on "Oprah."

04:15.421 --> 04:19.380
And then last March
some girls were playing in a field

04:19.425 --> 04:21.689
when they found her body.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.253
All over her legs,
splotchy and scorched,

04:24.297 --> 04:27.164
were the burned imprints
of various coins.

04:31.170 --> 04:34.298
Few details are known
about the ongoing investigation,

04:34.340 --> 04:36.501
but police sources say
they are looking

04:36.542 --> 04:39.375
for a male suspect
wearing a white suit.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.381
And that was life at Hargrove High.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.776
People, get to class now!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.052
Thank you.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.252
Hey.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.751
Want to come smoke weed
with us after class?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.230
Um, sure.
That'd be cool.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.290
It will be.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.437
Jesus Christ.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.444
What's your name again?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.378
Caroline.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.644
I'm Paul.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.016
Charles, Craig and Thurston.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.748
Yeah, we've met.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.987
So why would you
ever move to a place like this?

05:28.027 --> 05:30.587
Ugh, well, my dad works
for this huge development...

05:30.630 --> 05:32.461
Dude, you're not even inhaling.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.726
I'm inhaling.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.893
You're basically making out with it.
You got your goober all over it.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.800
- There's a girl in here.
- Ow.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.965
I was now attending
the most drugged-out high school

05:44.010 --> 05:46.342
in the whole country,
honest to God.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.404
These guys smoked pot,

05:48.448 --> 05:50.780
sniffed glue,
snorted crystal,

05:50.817 --> 05:54.275
did Ecstasy in toilets...
anything to kill the boredom.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.981
But Thurston...

05:56.022 --> 05:58.889
he had reasons of his own.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.606
The face that you saw

06:15.641 --> 06:18.041
In the door

06:18.077 --> 06:20.841
Isn't looking

06:20.880 --> 06:24.441
At you anymore

06:26.419 --> 06:28.979
The name that you call

06:29.021 --> 06:31.546
In its place

06:31.591 --> 06:34.321
Isn't waiting

06:34.360 --> 06:38.990
For your embrace

06:40.166 --> 06:44.603
The world that you love
to behold

06:44.637 --> 06:48.869
Cannot hold you

06:48.908 --> 06:53.607
Anymore

06:57.817 --> 07:00.684
In a matter of time...

07:00.720 --> 07:02.449
Hey, Thurston.

07:04.357 --> 07:08.817
It would slip
from my mind

07:11.364 --> 07:15.198
In and out of my life.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.209
Okay, guys.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.674
Guys,

07:32.718 --> 07:35.846
these papers are just...

07:37.123 --> 07:40.684
Do you really hate school
that much?

07:40.726 --> 07:42.057
Is it me?

07:42.094 --> 07:44.358
Is it because I let you
call me Barry?

07:47.099 --> 07:49.624
Look, you know, I just...

07:49.669 --> 07:51.728
I just moved back
to this town.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.002
And I gotta tell you, this place
has become a real shithole.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.236
But I was you.

07:59.278 --> 08:03.442
I know you've got real thoughts
going on inside of there.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.576
So for tomorrow, no reading.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.212
I want you to write me
a three-page essay

08:08.254 --> 08:11.917
on the historical or religious figure
who you most admire.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.789
Okay?

08:13.826 --> 08:16.488
Tell me who it is
that you think you are.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.330
I don't know
why the idea came to me when it did,

08:24.370 --> 08:27.601
but I instantly knew
it would make life more interesting.

08:29.308 --> 08:32.277
Don't we all want to be
somebody different sometimes,

08:32.311 --> 08:36.111
someone smarter, sexier
and bolder than we really are?

08:37.149 --> 08:41.107
Or maybe I just looked and saw
someone that was as lonely as me.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.647
After my mom died
and we started moving all the time,

08:45.691 --> 08:48.524
it was like my dad and I
had all this love to give

08:48.561 --> 08:50.620
but no one to give it to.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.564
Or maybe I just went a little crazy.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.363
Thomas.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.461
For a while there it seemed like

08:58.504 --> 09:00.495
craziness was in the air.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.169
We were all just breathing it in.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.659
You wanted to see me?

09:21.694 --> 09:23.992
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.856
Go ahead.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.733
Well, I wanted to tell you

09:30.770 --> 09:33.671
that I'm new here
and so far I hate it.

09:33.706 --> 09:36.903
Okay, but if you work hard...

09:36.943 --> 09:41.676
The guys here are
so immature and sexist.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.705
And the girls are worse.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.274
They eat it up...
no self-respect.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.954
And it's just all so different
from where we're supposed to be

09:51.991 --> 09:54.516
at this point in women's history,
you know?

09:57.463 --> 09:59.226
I wish I could argue.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.291
I went to this party

10:02.335 --> 10:04.200
where they were
passing out Rohypnol.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.200
That's the date-rape drug.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.866
I know what roofies are.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.477
How old are you?

10:13.512 --> 10:15.912
I'm not gonna answer that.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.907
35? 34?

10:19.952 --> 10:22.420
Ballpark, yeah.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.888
A babe in the woods.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.550
Anyway,

10:25.591 --> 10:29.186
I wanted to let you know
you're not alone.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.753
Here's my paper.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.190
Just point your foot
and kick it.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.220
Just don't feel like a pansy.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.937
- Oh!
- Ooh, shit.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.805
Fuck! Fuck.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.809
Are you okay?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.811
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.335
Pretty smooth, huh?

11:21.380 --> 11:24.110
I don't even like skateboarding.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.641
Yeah, well,
you should go walk it off.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.418
Yeah.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.185
Well, are you...

11:32.224 --> 11:33.714
can I walk it off with you?

11:36.462 --> 11:41.058
So do you even remember
meeting me at that party?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.125
Of course I do.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.833
I'm really sorry about...

11:47.873 --> 11:50.774
Oh yeah.
No, it's okay.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.044
So, Miss Wexler...

11:57.083 --> 11:58.516
Mm-hmm?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.418
...what do you think
of our fine town thus far?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.716
Um...

12:04.757 --> 12:06.725
We're waiting.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.719
I think it's
a stupefyingly friendly place

12:11.764 --> 12:14.289
full of wholesome, God-fearing,

12:14.333 --> 12:16.164
gun-bearing folk.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.193
It's not all that bad.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.137
You just gotta give people
a chance.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.163
Are you... are you high?

12:22.208 --> 12:24.540
There's more incest in this town
than in an Atom Egoyan film.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.908
Who?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.413
I said there's
a lot of incest here.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.472
Ah yes, incest...

12:30.516 --> 12:32.984
a game the whole family can play.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.851
Uh, I should go.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.413
Yeah, well,

12:38.457 --> 12:40.448
as always, it was a treat

12:40.493 --> 12:42.461
having you on the program,
Miss Wexler.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.190
Bye.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.959
Until next time.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.023
Okay.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.227
The first time I met Thurston

12:52.271 --> 12:56.002
he approached me at a party,
trying his best to be charming.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.109
And then I guess
things went wrong for him.

13:06.585 --> 13:10.282
He believed he was
the unluckiest person alive.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.051
How was school today, Lily?

13:12.091 --> 13:14.457
- Kids in my class are stupid.
- I doubt that.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.927
Tyler Jenkins can't even read.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.260
The Jenkins are crackers.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.734
Watch your French, Thurston.
I'm sure Tyler's trying.

13:22.768 --> 13:26.465
Mom, he is a cracker.
He has six toes.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.770
I'm sure there's some advantage to that,
like maybe swimming.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.376
Thurston.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.285
I don't know.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.884
Thurston.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.919
No, don't.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.760
Don't.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.195
It's not your fault.

14:00.239 --> 14:02.298
Well, I'm not doing the dishes.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.811
Thomas.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.588
I love you more than oxygen.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.494
Please come rescue me
from these fools.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.796
Hi, Mr. A.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.704
Caroline.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.538
Can I come in?

14:37.576 --> 14:39.043
No.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.909
The mat says "Welcome."

14:40.946 --> 14:43.107
I hate that mat.

14:43.148 --> 14:47.448
You know, there's a serial killer
running around with a white suit on.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.954
You really shouldn't joke
about things like that.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.651
You're the one
who won't let me in.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.124
I might die.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.696
Thanks.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.032
Very nice.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.168
Thank you.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.848
Who's this?

15:16.882 --> 15:18.372
That's my wife.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.351
Where is she?

15:21.387 --> 15:22.979
She's in the other room.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.284
Oh.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.815
Yeah, we're crazy in love.
It's wonderful.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.591
Um, I should leave.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.495
I'm kidding.
It's my sister.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.397
That's why she looks like me
with long hair.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.562
Funny.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.265
Caroline,

15:40.306 --> 15:42.331
to tell you the truth,
I know what you're doing.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.137
I read your paper.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.371
You didn't like my paper?

15:46.412 --> 15:49.245
I have a hard time believing
that Monica Lewinski

15:49.281 --> 15:51.215
is the historical figure
you most admire.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.218
I was critical.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.777
I said her problem was
she lacked discretion.

15:55.821 --> 15:58.483
She had a good thing going
and she blew it.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.690
Can I give you a lift home?

16:01.727 --> 16:03.285
You should really leave.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.797
- Ooh, can I have some wine?
- No no, absolutely not.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.459
No. Hey.

16:08.500 --> 16:12.163
This is like when people describe
a car crash happening in slow motion.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.229
You need to relax.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.070
I am the one seducing you.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.504
Besides,

16:23.549 --> 16:26.382
I find you very handsome.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.416
My mom once told me

16:35.461 --> 16:37.952
that if you ever want
to make a man happy,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.988
flatter his vanity,

16:40.032 --> 16:42.023
tell him he's handsome.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.937
She said not to bother
calling him interesting or clever,

16:47.973 --> 16:50.942
because that's what their bosses
and colleagues are for.

16:51.977 --> 16:56.471
But every man carries
a secret dream of being handsome

16:56.515 --> 16:59.951
and desperately yearns
to be recognized as such.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.084
So I read your papers
and overall they are an improvement.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.564
But punctuation and structure

17:12.598 --> 17:15.431
are still... still a mess.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.762
So to remedy this

17:19.805 --> 17:22.103
I will be offering
private tutorials after class

17:22.141 --> 17:24.540
to anyone who's interested.

17:24.576 --> 17:28.478
The schedule will begin
in reverse alphabetical order,

17:28.513 --> 17:30.482
which means that...

17:31.517 --> 17:34.179
Wexler, Caroline,

17:34.219 --> 17:36.813
you're up tonight.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.399
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.275
This is so wrong.

18:00.312 --> 18:01.802
Oh, relax.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.212
I don't want to be
a father figure.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.583
Oh my God.
I already have one of those, thank you.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.852
Do you promise me
you won't tell anybody?

18:11.890 --> 18:13.221
I promise.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.089
- Promise?
- I promise. I promise.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.171
Before we go any further,

18:36.215 --> 18:38.877
I should tell you the story
of Thurston and Rolly.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.027
Hey. You can't smoke in here.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.935
Why? Those people are smoking.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.633
Yeah, but this is my house

19:01.673 --> 19:04.471
and I get to decide
who can smoke.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.307
And you can't smoke.

19:12.084 --> 19:16.043
Hey, man, you probably shouldn't
be doing that.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.181
Why not?

19:18.223 --> 19:20.953
It's my house
I'm throwing them at.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.517
All right.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.093
This scar is a fleck

19:32.137 --> 19:34.731
On my porcelain skin

19:34.773 --> 19:36.764
Tried to reach deep

19:36.808 --> 19:39.606
But you couldn't get in

19:39.645 --> 19:41.943
Now you're outside me

19:41.980 --> 19:44.414
You see all the beauty

19:44.449 --> 19:46.007
- Repent all your sins...
- Hi.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.212
Hi.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.245
It's nothing but time

19:51.290 --> 19:53.781
And a face that you'll lose

19:53.825 --> 19:56.157
I chose to feel it...

20:00.032 --> 20:03.160
Fantastic.
Fan-fucking-tastic, man.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.136
Yeah.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.603
What a great girl...

20:06.638 --> 20:08.606
smart, funny,

20:08.640 --> 20:10.608
has big lips.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.272
You think she has a boyfriend?

20:15.314 --> 20:17.714
Oh, who gives a shit?

20:17.749 --> 20:21.276
A girl like that is born
with a boyfriend, I guess.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.311
So you steal her away.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.985
Yeah?

20:26.024 --> 20:27.548
Yeah.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.584
Yeah. Fuck yeah.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.726
It's not always so easy though.

20:32.764 --> 20:35.824
Man, if you're fated to be
with the girl,

20:35.867 --> 20:37.357
you gotta fight for her.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.496
Yeah, but I don't really believe
in that shit.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.530
What?

20:42.574 --> 20:44.337
You don't believe in fate?

20:44.376 --> 20:45.604
No.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.135
You believe in love, don't you?

20:48.180 --> 20:50.273
I mean, yeah, I guess.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.443
If you believe in love,

20:53.485 --> 20:55.919
you have to believe in fate.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.485
Trust me, okay?
I think about this shit all the time.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.179
Oh man.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.891
Thurston, wake up.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.920
Wake up.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.559
Oh shit.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.604
Okay.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.499
- What's wrong?
- My leg.

21:51.543 --> 21:52.976
- Are you all right?
- My leg.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.672
I think it's fucked up real bad.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.146
- Oh.
- What?

21:56.181 --> 21:57.978
Oh.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.149
Okay, listen.
I've got drugs in my pocket.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.155
You've got to hide them
before the police come

22:04.189 --> 22:05.986
or I'm royally fucked. Thurston!

22:06.024 --> 22:07.821
Sorry, yeah.
No, okay.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.484
God damn it.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.326
Are you boys
all right down there?

22:12.364 --> 22:14.389
I called for the police.
They're on the way.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.991
Oh no, we're okay,
Thank you.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.002
Call back and tell them
not to come.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.230
You need any help?

22:19.271 --> 22:20.533
Uh, no, thank you.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.938
- What?
- Mind your own fucking business.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.271
Go.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.319
Thurston told me that standing there

22:42.361 --> 22:45.489
in the middle of the forest,
all the life suddenly went out of him

22:45.530 --> 22:47.896
and he was demoted
from hero to victim.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.299
But with that shift
of responsibility

22:50.335 --> 22:52.326
came a great peace.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.648
What Thurston didn't know
was that a man in a grey suit...

23:05.684 --> 23:08.152
not the killer at all
but just some poor guy

23:08.186 --> 23:10.313
in the wrong place
at the wrong time...

23:10.355 --> 23:13.347
was doing everything he could
to save Rolly's life.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.352
Later the doctors said that Rolly
had been hemorrhaging internally

23:19.398 --> 23:21.832
and there was nothing
anyone could have done.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.836
And though he could hear
the distant sirens,

23:26.872 --> 23:30.239
Thurston knew that an ambulance
can only go so fast.

23:30.275 --> 23:33.039
And even in the midst
of all this

23:33.078 --> 23:35.979
he was dreaming of us
building a cabin in the mountains,

23:36.014 --> 23:38.244
away from it all.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.012
But that would have to wait,

23:40.051 --> 23:42.781
because his life
was a miracle of bad luck.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.812
And that's how
Thurston fell in love

23:44.856 --> 23:47.450
and watched his friend die
on the same night.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.099
Wake up.
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.728
Please stop.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.261
It's Sunday.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.137
It's the Lord's day.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.733
It's the day Lord rested.
Please.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.006
- No, it's not. Guess what I did.
- What?

24:07.045 --> 24:09.036
Made breakfast for you.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.412
- What did you make?
- Happy eggs.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.441
Why are they happy?

24:13.485 --> 24:15.476
'Cause they're for you,

24:15.520 --> 24:18.011
mon professeur de les oeoufs.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.794
- Aww.
- Aww.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.002
That coffee's terrible, babe.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.805
Well, excuse me.
I've never made coffee before.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.813
Really? You're in the gifted program.
It should be easy.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.145
Sorry, Mr. A.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.380
Mmm, the eggs are good though.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.820
Right?

24:50.856 --> 24:52.949
All right, don't get cocky.

24:54.559 --> 24:57.426
Good morning, sir.
Is Caroline home?

24:57.462 --> 24:59.589
No no, she spent the night
with some friends.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.098
She has friends?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.590
What's your name, son?

25:03.635 --> 25:06.399
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I misplace my manners.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.963
- My name's Thurston.
- Thurston, Mr. Wexler.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.305
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Glad to meet you.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.439
Uh, can I ask you something,
Mr. Wexler?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.640
Sure.

25:17.749 --> 25:20.309
Do you feel like
your daughter's happy here?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.788
Are you... are you trying
to sell me something?

25:24.823 --> 25:27.553
What? Why?

25:27.592 --> 25:30.584
No, I just... can I come in?

25:30.629 --> 25:32.028
No.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.392
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, that's weird.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.760
I sometimes
just wonder if Caroline's

25:38.803 --> 25:41.863
integrating well with people.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.671
Huh.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.837
I'm gonna close
the door now, okay, Thurston?

25:47.879 --> 25:51.371
Right. Well,
nice to meet you, sir.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.316
See, we've already done that,

25:53.351 --> 25:55.649
so you can just go.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.018
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.682
- All right.
- All right, have a good day.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.418
- Yeah, you too.
- Okay, bye.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.018
- Okay, bye. It was nice to meet you.
- Uh-huh.

26:09.100 --> 26:13.537
Today we're going to go over
the scientific process.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.866
I see the usual crew of jokers
are AWOL,

26:18.910 --> 26:21.435
so maybe we'll actually
get something accomplished.

26:21.479 --> 26:24.039
The first step
of any experiment

26:24.082 --> 26:27.108
is to assemble
the necessary tools.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.813
Charles, you got papers?

26:28.853 --> 26:30.047
Check.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.818
Next, review your thesis statement.

26:32.857 --> 26:36.520
What exactly are
you trying to prove?

26:36.561 --> 26:38.222
I am completely confident

26:38.263 --> 26:40.390
that something in this kitchen
will get us high.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.230
Now let the experimenting begin.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.702
Pure vanilla extract.

27:26.211 --> 27:30.045
Well, now that you're all done,

27:30.081 --> 27:33.881
write up your results
and clean your workspace.

27:35.553 --> 27:38.954
I hope this did something
to expand your young minds.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.826
We gotta go to class.

27:44.863 --> 27:46.421
Why?

27:46.464 --> 27:49.456
If you guys skip Ms. Budge's class,
you're gonna be screwed.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.334
Guys, I don't feel too good.

27:52.370 --> 27:56.033
Hey, do you guys think

27:56.074 --> 27:57.803
that maybe we could

27:57.842 --> 28:00.606
talk about what happened
to Rolly sometime?

28:00.645 --> 28:02.943
Sure, man.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.347
Is there anything
you want to say?

28:05.383 --> 28:07.374
I don't know.

28:07.419 --> 28:10.547
I just...
his funeral was...

28:10.588 --> 28:12.522
The funeral was bullshit.

28:12.557 --> 28:15.287
- It was fucked, right?
- Yeah.

28:15.326 --> 28:17.886
It's weird. I didn't even know
his name was Roland.

28:17.929 --> 28:21.524
I keep having this dream

28:21.566 --> 28:24.967
where I see him standing
outside my window.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.768
I am way too high
to be dealing with this right now.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.071
Plus, we need to go, man.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.972
Yeah, sure.

28:37.015 --> 28:40.951
Sorry, just a bad stoner moment.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.782
Let's go to class.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.812
Before I start,
I want to talk about something

28:44.856 --> 28:46.653
that's been affecting
our community.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.660
Now I know you're all young
and indestructible,

28:50.995 --> 28:53.725
but another girl in Hargrove County
has gone missing,

28:53.765 --> 28:55.892
so these curfews are
for your own good.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.595
Craig, Craig.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.693
Yeah?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.329
Are you all right?

29:00.371 --> 29:02.202
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.208
Then pay attention.

29:08.146 --> 29:10.671
Oh my God.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.706
What?

29:12.751 --> 29:16.084
Oh my God. Angie, go and get
the school nurse now.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.487
What... what...
what are you talking about?

29:18.523 --> 29:22.482
Everybody, just give him...
give him some room to breathe.

29:22.527 --> 29:24.358
What's wrong
with you people?!

29:24.395 --> 29:26.386
Craig!

29:33.204 --> 29:35.035
Oh.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.267
Craig!

29:38.209 --> 29:41.770
The doctor said it was some kind of
drug-induced seizure.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.714
You know, there's a real problem
at this school

29:44.749 --> 29:47.274
and no one has the courage
to talk about it.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.854
Yes?

29:51.890 --> 29:53.187
I'm here for him.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.818
Oh, is it time
for your tutorial already?

29:55.860 --> 29:57.088
Mm-hmm.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.925
So you tutor now?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.261
Are you some kind
of superteacher?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.460
He goes way above
the call of duty.

30:03.501 --> 30:05.969
Yeah, well,
he can't help you today,

30:06.004 --> 30:08.097
'cause he promised
he'd help me with the track team.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.130
Isn't that right, Barry?

30:10.175 --> 30:11.870
That's right.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.174
Um, I've been waiting here

30:14.212 --> 30:16.442
and I would like
to be tutored.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.450
Well, you're gonna have to learn
to live with disappointment.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.974
Fuck you, gym bitch.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.078
- What did you say?
- Caroline.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.681
What?

30:25.723 --> 30:29.557
I'm sorry, Miss Wexler,
but we're going to have to reschedule.

30:30.962 --> 30:32.259
Don't bother.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.957
She called me a bitch.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.176
After that
I rode out to the old satellite dish

30:55.220 --> 30:57.814
where I sat and pondered
what turns of fate had brought me

30:57.856 --> 30:59.790
to such a reprehensible place in life.

30:59.824 --> 31:02.657
Red oak

31:02.694 --> 31:05.219
Sugar

31:05.263 --> 31:07.857
And Korean dogwood...

31:07.899 --> 31:10.333
I knew
that Mr. Anderson was nervous

31:10.368 --> 31:12.268
about our relationship,

31:12.303 --> 31:14.430
though our age difference
was only two years more

31:14.472 --> 31:16.736
than the one between my father
and my mom.

31:16.774 --> 31:19.299
Lit my mission moonlight

31:19.344 --> 31:22.313
Kangas on that hillside...

31:23.481 --> 31:26.279
Before long,
the sound of the wind and the grass

31:26.317 --> 31:28.342
lulled me into slumber.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.718
And though dreams are
by definition strange,

31:30.755 --> 31:32.985
the dream I slipped into
was particularly odd,

31:33.024 --> 31:35.686
because it was not my own
but someone else's.

31:37.295 --> 31:40.458
I dreamt that Thurston and I were
living in a mountain cabin

31:40.498 --> 31:42.056
far from the world.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.295
I churned butter
while he chopped wood.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.997
And we lived only for love.

31:47.038 --> 31:50.064
One blue day
Thurston hired an airplane

31:50.108 --> 31:52.167
to write my name in the sky.

31:52.210 --> 31:56.374
But either the pilot was drunk
or I had married an illiterate,

31:56.414 --> 31:59.008
because the word that he spelled
was just an illegible jumble

31:59.050 --> 32:01.280
of consonants and vowels.

32:03.288 --> 32:07.088
I knew then that our love
was not some idealized state

32:07.125 --> 32:09.491
but a union
of secrets and flaws.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.893
And it broke my heart
to think such things.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.070
Hello.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.734
Hi, baby.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.074
How's the track team doing?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.341
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.474
It's just, you know, things are starting
to look a little suspicious.

32:32.517 --> 32:33.745
Have you fucked her yet?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.446
No. No.

32:35.486 --> 32:38.216
We're at some cheap
old restaurant

32:38.256 --> 32:40.884
where they keep bringing out sparklers
and singing "Happy Birthday."

32:40.925 --> 32:44.725
Caroline, look, I'm a single guy
living in a small town of gossips.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.957
I gotta go out
with somebody sometime.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.865
Yeah, well, how would you like it
if I did that?

32:49.901 --> 32:53.200
Yeah, you probably should.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.531
You're saying I should date
some high school idiot?

32:56.574 --> 33:00.032
Yeah. I don't know.
Look, it's really loud in here

33:00.078 --> 33:01.443
and you're cracking up.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.606
Oh, no no no.
Don't do this.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.980
I can't... Caroline, you're cracking up.
I promise you

33:06.017 --> 33:07.780
- I'll call you later, okay?
- But...

33:25.436 --> 33:27.461
Okay, just a second.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.541
Hi. Is Thurston home?

33:35.580 --> 33:36.877
Yes.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.381
Come on in.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.974
Thank you.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.545
Lily, go tell Thurston
that his friend...

33:43.588 --> 33:44.748
Caroline.

33:44.789 --> 33:47.019
...Caroline is here.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.722
I hope you don't mind me
saying this,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.359
but you are
a beautiful young lady.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.393
Oh, thank you.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.928
I love your hair.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.339
Do you?
It's usually horrible.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.002
Mine's like straw.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.274
- No, it's so pretty.
- Oh.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.543
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll leave you two.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.844
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.221
I hope my mom's didn't say
anything embarrassing.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.248
Oh no. She's nice.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.726
Although she did say
you still wet the bed, so...

34:24.762 --> 34:26.228
What?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.664
I'm just kidding.
A bad joke.

34:28.699 --> 34:32.065
Oh, well, 'cause, I mean,
do still wet the bed

34:32.103 --> 34:34.071
and I was wondering
how you knew that.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.367
Mmm.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.172
Yeah.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.201
Well, we've got a real

34:41.245 --> 34:44.179
Algonquin Table of wit
going on here, don't we?

34:44.215 --> 34:46.206
What table?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.014
Anyway, I think you're cute

34:49.053 --> 34:51.043
and I want to go out with you.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.681
Really?

34:52.723 --> 34:54.418
Yes. Yeah.
Okay, let's go.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.255
Okay. Hey, Mom,
I'll be back in a bit.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.285
Nice to meet you.

35:10.641 --> 35:14.441
So do you have any condoms?

35:14.479 --> 35:17.107
Uh, no.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.116
I didn't... I didn't think
to bring any.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.708
Oh.

35:20.751 --> 35:24.278
Well, I guess
you're gonna miss out then.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.017
Fuck.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.524
Uh...

35:27.558 --> 35:30.288
well, we could go get some
from Paul's.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.922
I'm just fucking with you.
I have some in my bag actually.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.955
Okay.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.866
Great.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.927
Okay, here.
Just put it on fast.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.962
Okay.

35:42.006 --> 35:44.338
Do you mind if we put on
some music or something?

35:45.409 --> 35:47.809
I'm kind of a little...

35:47.845 --> 35:50.245
I'm just kind of nervous.

35:50.281 --> 35:53.114
Thurston, there is a seat belt
stabbing into my ovaries.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.678
I think it might be a little late
for romance and stuff.

35:58.556 --> 35:59.853
Okay.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.990
All right, fine.

36:05.096 --> 36:07.360
Okay, here goes.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.066
Okay?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.969
Come on.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.439
Just...

36:32.590 --> 36:34.615
Yay.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.653
I'm sorry.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.824
Don't be sorry.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.959
Are you okay?

36:45.036 --> 36:47.061
Yeah.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.843
Well...

37:15.733 --> 37:18.531
What the fuck?
Did you hear that?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.833
I don't know.

37:20.871 --> 37:24.398
What the fuck?
Someone is throwing shit at the car.

37:24.442 --> 37:27.104
Do you think you could

37:27.144 --> 37:29.738
go figure out
what the fuck that was?

37:32.550 --> 37:35.212
Do you mind playing the role
of the man here maybe?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.415
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.925
Fine.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.986
How did it go?

37:46.030 --> 37:47.964
I don't know.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.193
We had sex.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.929
Oh.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.267
Oh dear.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.205
So for those of you finished
with Jane Austen,

37:56.240 --> 37:59.869
feel free to start with Faulkner.
Otherwise, read read read.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.470
Caroline, could I see you
after class, please?

38:02.513 --> 38:03.980
I don't know if I have time.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.279
Make time.

38:06.317 --> 38:08.342
So how was Miss Budge
in the sack?

38:08.386 --> 38:09.819
Did she wear her whistle?

38:09.854 --> 38:12.220
Actually I spent half of the evening
talking her out of suspending you

38:12.256 --> 38:13.689
for calling her "gym bitch."

38:15.426 --> 38:17.451
Look, for the first time
you're acting your age

38:17.495 --> 38:19.326
and it really doesn't suit you.

38:19.363 --> 38:21.422
Well, right back at you,
Mr. Polanski.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.491
Look, this is great.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.470
You're...

38:29.807 --> 38:31.570
great,

38:31.609 --> 38:34.476
but you've got to be aware
that people are watching me.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.442
Does it make you feel special?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.210
Could we stop
with the sarcasm, please?

38:39.250 --> 38:40.410
Sorry.

38:40.451 --> 38:43.284
I want to spend the weekend
with you at my place.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.312
I'll cook dinner.
We'll play board games.

38:45.356 --> 38:47.722
Really?
Just us alone?

38:47.758 --> 38:49.885
Yeah, no gym teachers
for miles.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.087
Ooh, good.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.358
Here.

38:53.397 --> 38:55.957
What's that?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.764
This is my novel...

38:58.803 --> 39:00.634
well, the first
70 pages anyway.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.400
My agent is the only one
who's read it.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.431
He thinks it's the best thing
I've ever done.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.636
I'm so inspired
when I'm with you.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.168
I want you to read it,
tell me what you think.

39:10.214 --> 39:12.842
I think you should
lock the door.

39:13.984 --> 39:15.645
Oh yeah, Miss Wexler?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.950
Lock it, Shakespeare.

39:27.231 --> 39:29.222
Ugh, slut.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.195
What did you call me?

39:32.236 --> 39:36.172
I think I just called you
a slut, slut.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.198
Why?

39:38.242 --> 39:40.233
Because everyone knows
that you've banged,

39:40.277 --> 39:42.472
like, 40 different guys
since you came here.

39:44.415 --> 39:47.350
Really? 40?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.183
Okay, let's just say
I have banged 40 guys...

39:50.221 --> 39:52.246
what's the problem?

39:52.289 --> 39:55.258
You're just jealous
'cause you've been brainwashed

39:55.292 --> 39:58.386
by puritanical assholes
who believe sex is a sin.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.227
But then again,

40:01.265 --> 40:03.529
your little gerbil-sized brain

40:03.567 --> 40:05.558
has been reprogrammed
by the media

40:05.603 --> 40:07.230
to believe sex is
the be all, end all.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.933
So now you're stuck, right?
'Cause on the one hand you love to fuck

40:09.974 --> 40:13.273
but afterwards you feel overwhelmed
by guilt and you're not sure why.

40:13.310 --> 40:16.177
Maybe it's because sex
is neither as good or as evil

40:16.213 --> 40:19.046
as you've built it up to be.

40:21.519 --> 40:22.816
Shut up, slut.

40:22.853 --> 40:26.687
Jenny, seriously,

40:26.724 --> 40:28.021
listen to me.

40:28.058 --> 40:31.255
The highlight of your entire life

40:31.295 --> 40:33.593
is gonna be
your yearbook photo.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.963
You are already nostalgic

40:36.000 --> 40:38.468
for shit that has not even
happened yet

40:38.502 --> 40:41.164
'cause you have so precious little
to look forward to.

40:41.205 --> 40:43.969
You're gonna spend the first half
of your life planning your wedding

40:44.008 --> 40:46.977
and you're gonna spend the second half
regretting it. And if I were you...

40:47.011 --> 40:49.605
and thank God I'm not,
'cause you have terrible hair...

40:49.647 --> 40:52.673
I would stop and I would reconsider
your whole value system,

40:52.716 --> 40:56.550
because everything
you know is wrong.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.911
I'm such a bitch.

41:31.956 --> 41:33.924
Okay, so I guess I've avoided

41:33.958 --> 41:35.826
talking about myself
for long enough.

41:35.826 --> 41:39.523
All I really know is that I'm just about
the moodiest girl in the world.

41:39.563 --> 41:42.532
I can't see anything at all

41:42.566 --> 41:45.694
All I see is me

41:45.736 --> 41:49.331
That's clear enough,
that's what's important

41:49.373 --> 41:51.637
To see me

41:51.675 --> 41:54.940
My eyes can focus,
my brain is talking

41:54.979 --> 41:57.504
It looks pretty good to me.

42:00.818 --> 42:04.015
I swear to God,
sometimes I get super depressed.

42:04.054 --> 42:07.182
A year after my mom died
I found a photo album

42:07.224 --> 42:09.522
with all these pictures
of my family.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.464
It was weird
to see us so happy,

42:22.506 --> 42:24.838
still looking forward
to something,

42:24.875 --> 42:27.139
no idea what was
about to happen.

42:40.991 --> 42:44.119
Anyway, for two weeks afterwards
I was so depressed.

42:44.161 --> 42:48.029
I couldn't even leave my room,
I was so sad.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.625
My dad took me to a doctor
who said I was suffering

42:50.668 --> 42:53.000
from lack of serotonin
to the brain.

42:53.037 --> 42:55.733
They gave me pills
and I zombied out for six months

42:55.773 --> 42:57.570
and watched game shows.

43:08.686 --> 43:10.586
I know you probably think

43:10.621 --> 43:12.054
I'm a manipulative bitch

43:12.089 --> 43:15.991
for sleeping with two guys,
but try looking at it this way:

43:16.026 --> 43:19.518
The sexual revolution is
just like any other revolution...

43:19.563 --> 43:21.793
there's gonna be casualties.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.696
- Good evening, Mr. Wexler.
- She's busy studying.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.298
Well, can I just say
a quick hello?

43:29.340 --> 43:30.807
Absolutely not.

43:32.209 --> 43:36.202
Well, it's just I...
I brought her all these cupcakes.

43:36.246 --> 43:39.238
My mom baked them, and I thought
it would be a nice gesture.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.808
Well, I'm not paying for those.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.286
No no, it's a gift.

43:46.423 --> 43:47.913
I'll make sure she gets them.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.823
- Closing the door, Thurst...
- Wait, hey,

43:49.860 --> 43:52.260
she could at least have
the courtesy to say something.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.093
I mean,
y-you can't treat people like this.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.598
Get your foot
out of our doorstep.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.033
Do you hear that, Caroline?!
You can't treat me like this!

43:58.068 --> 44:00.832
Stop making a fuss.
Get your foot out of my doorway.

44:03.073 --> 44:05.268
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:05.309 --> 44:08.005
I'm just...

44:08.045 --> 44:11.071
I'm just all fucked up.

44:11.115 --> 44:13.106
I know, son.

44:14.618 --> 44:16.415
Now get off my property.

44:28.866 --> 44:30.697
I got rid of him for you.

44:30.734 --> 44:34.033
Thanks, Daddy.

44:34.071 --> 44:38.030
You're not... you're not meeting him
on this weekend of yours, are you?

44:38.075 --> 44:41.203
No. I told you, it's all girls.

44:41.245 --> 44:43.076
'Cause I know
it's none of my business,

44:43.113 --> 44:45.172
but I really just don't want you
seeing this guy.

44:45.215 --> 44:47.445
Dad, I just asked you
to get rid of him.

44:47.484 --> 44:50.817
Show a little trust.

44:50.854 --> 44:53.414
His mom makes
really good cupcakes.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.354
What do you mean,
it didn't work?

44:56.393 --> 44:58.554
Just like I said.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.358
I don't think
her father likes me.

45:00.397 --> 45:02.388
Why wouldn't he like you?

45:02.433 --> 45:04.628
I don't know.

45:04.668 --> 45:07.501
I can't believe
they kept the cupcakes.

45:10.007 --> 45:13.067
I'm gonna go over there
and take care of this.

45:13.110 --> 45:14.771
Mom, no.

45:14.812 --> 45:16.837
I don't think
that's a very good idea, Enid.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.041
Look, if I do this for you,
you promise me

45:19.083 --> 45:21.051
you never treat a woman
like your father did;

45:21.085 --> 45:24.418
you never cheat on her;
you treat her like homespun gold.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.218
Yeah, of course, Mom.

45:26.256 --> 45:27.655
Watch Lily for me.

45:27.691 --> 45:30.660
Wait, you're not gonna do
anything embarrassing, are you?

45:30.694 --> 45:33.458
I'm your mother.
I don't do anything embarrassing.

45:33.497 --> 45:35.522
I'm too shagadelic for that.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.195
Good Lord.

45:48.212 --> 45:51.113
One, two, three. Hide.

45:52.116 --> 45:54.550
99, 98,

45:54.585 --> 45:57.349
97, 96...

45:58.622 --> 46:00.146
Candygram!

46:04.962 --> 46:08.329
This weed is wheelchair shit.
Seizures all around tonight, boys.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.901
Hi. Mr. Wexler?

46:11.935 --> 46:13.664
Yeah.

46:13.704 --> 46:16.730
I'm Enid Goldberg,

46:16.774 --> 46:18.469
Thurston's mom.

46:18.509 --> 46:21.137
Oh. Oh.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.810
I made you
some more cupcakes.

46:24.848 --> 46:26.782
I thought we could talk.

46:29.119 --> 46:31.781
Sure. Yeah. Of course.

46:31.822 --> 46:34.723
Would you like to come in
and have a drink?

46:34.758 --> 46:36.453
Yes.

46:36.493 --> 46:38.961
Thank you so much.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.327
Yeah.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.338
If you tell anyone I did that,

46:51.375 --> 46:54.276
I'll kill your whole family.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.835
Okay.

47:16.233 --> 47:17.928
What?

47:17.968 --> 47:19.993
You haven't told anyone
about us, have you?

47:20.037 --> 47:22.062
Ah! Stop being so paranoid.

47:34.451 --> 47:36.783
I should find Lily.

47:36.820 --> 47:39.152
Stop being so paranoid.

47:39.189 --> 47:41.487
Yeah, man.
Just put on some music.

47:47.831 --> 47:50.391
It happened
about four years ago.

47:50.434 --> 47:53.995
She... she was diagnosed
with breast cancer

47:54.037 --> 47:55.834
and throat cancer,

47:55.873 --> 47:58.000
even though she never smoked
a day in her life.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.771
And then she passed on
about six months after that.

48:00.811 --> 48:03.609
Oh, that's too much.

48:03.647 --> 48:04.875
I'm sorry.

48:04.915 --> 48:06.473
Thank you.

48:06.516 --> 48:08.313
You know,
the frightening thing is

48:08.352 --> 48:10.820
that Caroline looks
exactly like her...

48:10.854 --> 48:12.845
I mean exactly.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.881
Caroline is beautiful.

48:14.925 --> 48:17.052
Thank you.

48:17.094 --> 48:20.723
But it's very scary being a father
of a teenage daughter like her,

48:20.764 --> 48:22.254
I tell you.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.097
Do you want some more?

48:25.135 --> 48:26.363
Oh no.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.871
Oh, well, maybe a little bit.

48:33.210 --> 48:37.044
And what about your husband?

48:37.080 --> 48:39.571
Oh, he passed

48:39.616 --> 48:42.050
a few years ago.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.553
He died?

48:44.588 --> 48:47.386
Well, I don't know,

48:47.424 --> 48:50.086
but I like to think so.

48:53.297 --> 48:55.356
- Okay.
- I hope he's dead in hell.

48:55.399 --> 48:57.390
Oh no. Enid, come on.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.197
Why not?

48:59.236 --> 49:01.261
Yeah, why not?

49:02.606 --> 49:05.131
He was a musician

49:05.175 --> 49:08.611
and that is really romantic
when you are 17,

49:08.645 --> 49:11.205
but he was always gone
on tour.

49:11.248 --> 49:13.739
And then a few years ago

49:13.784 --> 49:16.548
he just stopped coming home.

49:20.924 --> 49:23.916
I don't know
why I'm laughing.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.191
Yes, I do.

49:26.229 --> 49:27.924
I'm drunk.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.298
Well, I have absolutely no idea

49:32.336 --> 49:35.237
why anybody would stop
coming home to you.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.975
My son Thurston...

49:48.018 --> 49:49.542
Yes.

49:49.586 --> 49:53.488
He's a really smart boy.
He's just had a hard time.

49:53.523 --> 49:55.957
I'm sorry.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.018
I judged him too quickly.

50:05.902 --> 50:08.166
Would you like
to dance with me?

50:08.205 --> 50:11.003
Oh yes.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.201
Yeah.

50:12.242 --> 50:14.802
Do you ever think about God?

50:14.845 --> 50:17.780
Sometimes in church.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.374
What do you think
he looks like?

50:21.418 --> 50:23.784
Kind of like Santa Claus,

50:23.820 --> 50:26.186
but with a beard
made of clouds and stuff.

50:26.223 --> 50:28.316
And instead of being fat,

50:28.358 --> 50:30.349
he's got really good abs.

50:30.394 --> 50:32.419
Yeah, I think you're right.

50:33.663 --> 50:35.654
That's them. Run.

51:12.736 --> 51:13.964
Keep up.

51:14.004 --> 51:15.995
Did you just hear something?

51:16.039 --> 51:18.098
Have you ever thought about
growing a mustache?

51:18.141 --> 51:19.972
I'm not 100% sure I can.

51:20.010 --> 51:22.001
Maybe after my birthday.

51:22.045 --> 51:23.876
Hey, Thomas,

51:23.914 --> 51:26.883
what do you think
the end of the world will look like?

51:26.917 --> 51:29.579
Do you think it's just like
when you shut off the TV?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.652
Thomas?

51:34.724 --> 51:36.715
Thomas!

52:18.702 --> 52:21.535
Baby, do you not want
to go to school today?

52:21.571 --> 52:23.402
Huh-uh.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.567
Are you sure?

52:28.411 --> 52:30.402
Okay.

53:19.396 --> 53:20.886
You look beautiful.

53:20.931 --> 53:23.627
You had your mom come to my house
to beg for another date?

53:23.667 --> 53:25.999
- That is so pathetic.
- Yes, I agree.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.971
- You're such a weirdo.
- Yes, I know this.

53:29.005 --> 53:31.303
- What is your problem?
- I don't know. I don't know.

53:31.341 --> 53:34.003
Well, you're fucked, because my dad
is forcing me to go out with you,

53:34.044 --> 53:36.535
so let's just get this
over with, all right?

53:36.580 --> 53:38.548
Pick me up at 8:00.

53:38.582 --> 53:40.573
Okay.

53:40.617 --> 53:42.084
I'll call you.

53:48.558 --> 53:49.889
Hey, baby.

53:49.926 --> 53:52.724
Hello. I am
so fucking happy right now.

53:52.762 --> 53:54.855
My book is coming along great
and it's all because of you.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.422
Now get over here.

53:56.466 --> 53:58.491
Caroline, your friend is here.

53:58.535 --> 53:59.968
Coming.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.994
Ugh, I gotta go out
with this loser,

54:02.038 --> 54:03.835
but afterwards
I'll come right over, okay?

54:03.873 --> 54:05.864
You have a date?
Who is it with?

54:05.909 --> 54:08.434
Come on, you gotta tell me.

54:08.478 --> 54:09.843
Why? Are you jealous?

54:09.879 --> 54:12.279
Yeah, of course I'm jealous.
Some guy is taking out my girl.

54:12.315 --> 54:14.909
Who is it? Come on, tell me.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

54:16.786 --> 54:18.515
Thurston Goldberg.

54:18.555 --> 54:20.455
No way.

54:20.490 --> 54:23.584
That is fantastic.

54:23.627 --> 54:27.085
You gotta read one of his
papers sometime. They are classic.

54:27.130 --> 54:28.495
I gotta go.

54:28.531 --> 54:30.931
All right, look, ditch him fast.
I got wine. I got candles.

54:30.967 --> 54:32.525
Okay, be there soon.

54:32.569 --> 54:35.402
- All right, come on, hurry.
- Okay, bye.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.531
I guess I don't really know
that much about golf.

54:37.574 --> 54:39.201
- No?
- I've been mini-golfing before,

54:39.242 --> 54:41.233
- but that's...
- Not quite the same.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.303
No. No, it's not.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.509
- How's your mom?
- Oh great.

54:47.550 --> 54:49.643
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she cut my hair today actually.

54:49.686 --> 54:50.778
- Cut your hair?
- Yeah.

54:50.820 --> 54:53.755
Yeah, look at that.
Well, she did a good job. That's nice.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.314
- You think so?
- Oh yeah.

54:55.358 --> 54:57.417
- I think she screwed the back up.
- The back? Let me see.

54:57.460 --> 55:00.429
Are we going out or what?

55:04.501 --> 55:07.129
- I guess we're going out.
- I ain't going.

55:07.170 --> 55:09.570
- All right, thanks for the beer.
- All right. See you later, son.

55:09.606 --> 55:11.437
See you.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.639
Okay, where are we going?
What are we doing?

55:45.075 --> 55:47.066
Okay, well, first of all

55:47.110 --> 55:49.772
I think that we probably should not
have sex together tonight.

55:49.813 --> 55:51.804
I think that's maybe
where we went wrong last time.

55:51.848 --> 55:54.783
Okay. That wasn't
going to happen anyway.

55:54.818 --> 55:57.810
Look, I know you like me.
I know that that sounds strange

55:57.854 --> 56:00.618
because of how cruel
you are to me but...

56:00.657 --> 56:02.522
That does sound strange.

56:02.559 --> 56:05.119
But I think that's why
you had sex with me so fast.

56:05.161 --> 56:08.688
And by the way,
that was my first time so...

56:08.732 --> 56:09.960
You're kidding.

56:09.999 --> 56:13.298
I will get better
as our relationship progresses.

56:13.336 --> 56:15.201
What?!

56:16.239 --> 56:18.673
Thurston... oh my God,

56:18.708 --> 56:21.973
why is everyone
in this town so delusional?

56:22.011 --> 56:25.538
The girls around here...
the highlight of their pathetic lives

56:25.582 --> 56:27.413
is gonna be
their yearbook photo.

56:27.450 --> 56:28.644
That's not true.

56:28.685 --> 56:30.949
They'll spend the first half
of their lives planning their weddings

56:30.987 --> 56:33.421
and they'll spend
the second half regretting them.

56:33.456 --> 56:36.186
No, they'll have kids
and be surprisingly happy.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.820
Everybody just cheats
on each other.

56:38.862 --> 56:42.491
No, I would never ever
cheat on you.

56:42.532 --> 56:44.329
Oh my God.

56:44.367 --> 56:46.494
All right, date's over.
You're insane.

56:48.037 --> 56:49.698
Okay.

56:49.739 --> 56:51.900
Well, can I at least talk to you
tomorrow at school?

56:51.941 --> 56:55.138
Tomorrow's Saturday, moron.

56:56.179 --> 56:58.170
Right.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.441
Look, you can

57:01.484 --> 57:03.975
call me, okay?

57:04.020 --> 57:06.045
If you want.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.353
Okay.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.487
Why don't you just
give me your face for a second?

57:12.529 --> 57:14.520
Why?

57:17.434 --> 57:20.267
Ugh, all right.
Okay, thank you.

57:20.303 --> 57:21.600
Bye.

57:21.638 --> 57:22.969
Okay.

57:23.006 --> 57:24.405
Happy Saturday.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.341
- I got it.
- Yeah, you got it.

57:29.379 --> 57:30.846
Sorry I'm tardy, Mr. A.

57:32.182 --> 57:34.207
Come in quick.

57:41.925 --> 57:45.258
That night I tried
to pretend we were a regular couple.

57:47.564 --> 57:49.555
I've been told

57:49.599 --> 57:51.624
I'm living a lie

57:51.668 --> 57:53.659
I've been told

57:53.703 --> 57:56.365
All my life

57:56.406 --> 57:58.397
I've been told

57:58.441 --> 58:00.875
I'm living a lie

58:00.910 --> 58:02.935
I've been told

58:02.979 --> 58:05.413
All my life...

58:08.151 --> 58:11.712
But when it was over,
I felt more like a fake than ever.

58:13.256 --> 58:17.056
So I crept downstairs
to finish reading his manuscript.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.520
The story follows a boy named Larry

58:46.556 --> 58:48.786
as he comes of age
in a small town.

58:48.825 --> 58:51.157
Larry is convinced
that he's a genius.

58:51.194 --> 58:54.186
And like most geniuses,
he has trouble fitting in

58:54.230 --> 58:56.255
and so spends
nearly all his time

58:56.299 --> 58:58.324
high on cheap drugs.

59:04.274 --> 59:07.175
As he grows older,
Larry moves to the city

59:07.210 --> 59:09.474
and gets engaged
to a beautiful stockbroker.

59:09.512 --> 59:10.774
I gotta tell him.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.941
But owing to his
misspent youth and drug-addled brain,

59:13.983 --> 59:17.009
he never achieves the success
he believes the world owes him.

59:18.354 --> 59:21.414
One day Larry comes home
early from work

59:21.457 --> 59:23.618
and catches his fiancee
and his best friend

59:23.660 --> 59:25.594
on a Twister board...

59:25.628 --> 59:27.459
his Twister board.

59:31.234 --> 59:33.429
In a rage he buys a gun

59:33.469 --> 59:35.460
and decides
to become a serial killer,

59:35.505 --> 59:38.872
but realizes he doesn't have the nerve
and so tries to kill himself...

59:38.908 --> 59:40.068
My Twister board, Todd.

59:40.109 --> 59:42.134
...but chickens out of that too.

59:43.980 --> 59:46.312
Larry then moves back
to his home town

59:46.349 --> 59:49.011
where he begins indulging
in strange behavior.

59:49.052 --> 59:52.317
Like sometimes he drives
through the streets all night

59:52.355 --> 59:54.414
hunting for ghosts long past.

59:56.225 --> 59:58.216
And other times
he calls old friends

59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.753
and pretends to be a telemarketer
with a bad fake British accent.

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:04.266
- He asks them questions like...
- Do you believe in God?

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.234
"How much do you earn in a year?"

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.703
"What do you think
the end of the world will look like?"

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:11.172
"Are you happy?
If so, why?

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.835
How can you be happy?
Don't you watch the news?"

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:16.401
Finally, as in all good tales,

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.540
Larry is saved by the love
of an ethereal young woman.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:22.949
She is his muse,
every guy's wet dream

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.353
whose sole purpose is
to service his every need.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:29.790
And only when with this cliched,
vapid little moron

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.761
does he feel like the genius
he knew he'd become.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.330
All that in 70 pages.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.404
Ugh.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.537
So?

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.207
What do you think?

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:55.217
Of what?

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.082
My book.
What do you think?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.384
Oh God.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.086
I think it's very well written.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:07.619
Yeah, that's what
my agent said too.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.261
I just...

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:19.436
am I the ethereal
young woman?

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:22.205
Well, it's...
you know, it's fiction,

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:25.043
so it's a bit
of an oversimplification,

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:27.447
but essentially, yeah.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.474
Okay.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.113
Shall I just say
everything I thought?

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.146
Yeah, of course.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.988
Tell me.
Come on, I can take it.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.756
Okay.

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:43.288
Well, Larry...

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:46.426
is semi-engaging

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.029
in that pseudo-creepy,

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:53.441
self-pitying lonely male
kind of way,

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:57.378
but if you have the audacity,

01:01:57.413 --> 01:02:00.507
the inaccuracy

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.519
to describe me as ethereal,

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:07.614
as some flawless, perfect thing,

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.750
then fuck you.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:12.693
No, fuck you.
You don't know anything about me.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:15.755
The only reason you think
I am ethereal

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:19.131
is because all we do is
have sex, flirt and have sex.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.692
There is more to you than that.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:23.001
I know that! I know,

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:25.269
but I'm not here to save you.

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.333
I'm the main character of my life.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:28.502
Calm down.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.875
Don't fucking tell me...

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.903
- Ooh.
- Shit.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.075
Um, I'm sorry.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:38.047
- That was an accident.
- Was it?

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.782
Yeah, just give it to me.

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.484
Where's your soap?

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.823
I don't know.
It's down by the washing machine.

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.328
Just don't...
don't worry about it.

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.455
No no no, I do this
for my dad all the time.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.898
I'll be back in a second, okay?

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.594
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.075
Mean bitch.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.243
Caroline, don't worry
about the shirt.

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.406
Let me fix you
a nice breakfast.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.817
Caroline.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:15.184
All I'm... no.
I'll I'm saying is

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.379
All I'm... no.
I'll I'm saying is

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.786
that I had a spiritual revelation.

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:23.280
I stepped outside my body
and I saw things that I didn't like.

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:26.327
Did you see Rolly?

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.159
No, Rolly's dead, dude.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.665
That's a completely different
plane of existence.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.634
Right.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.135
This is bullshit, man.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.400
You took some drugs
and you had a fucked up time,

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:38.964
end of story.
Take off the creepy tie.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.841
If I was from Tibet,
you'd believe me though, right?

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.041
If I was a young Navajo boy
on a vision quest

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.515
doing a little peyote,
my words would be prophetic.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.108
Okay, but isn't it possible

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.711
that inhaling Lysol had something
to do with your awakening?

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:54.587
All I know is that some people
spend their entire lives

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:58.151
searching for the experience I gained
with a few simple household products.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:01.489
And that is
nothing to scoff at.

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:05.731
Hey, where are you going, man?

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:09.226
To be honest, it tires me
just looking at you.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:15.003
That's the problem...
you see God once

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:18.207
and suddenly you have divine permission
to act like an asshole.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:21.216
Hey, look.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.195
When I'm on

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.231
Will you leave me on?

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.765
When I'm on

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:50.301
Will you leave me on?

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.576
And when I'm down

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.982
Will you let me get under?

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.585
Take cover

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:09.590
Can't hide without a house

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.430
Newspapers blow over

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:16.564
Can't walk past the driveway

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:20.507
Without asking for direction

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:26.004
So full of stupid questions

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:29.711
When the daylight's
like fluorescent light

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:33.415
I'm gonna take my time,
night by night

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:37.790
When the daylight's
like fluorescent light

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.354
I hang my hands
over your eyes

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.422
To hide

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:52.203
Why not only rescue me?

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:55.608
I watch that telethon

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.635
Got hung up

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.878
On the word
I can't get over

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.225
Take cover

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.156
Take pleasure.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.405
Okay, guys, how about
a little participation next class?

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.845
I really don't like the sound
of my own voice that much.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.576
Miss Wexler, could I see you
for a minute?

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.641
- Can't. I have to go.
- It's important.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.124
Look, I really need to talk to you.
This is humiliating for me.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:48.287
I'll come see you.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.355
- When?
- Tonight.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.390
I'll cook dinner?

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.473
Hey, Thurston. What's up?

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.341
Hey, Jenny.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.575
You look really hot today.

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:09.743
Thanks.
I gotta go.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:13.118
Oh, my parents are
going away this weekend.

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.315
Okay.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.346
Yeah, my parents
are going away

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.587
and I was thinking about maybe
having a Christmas party.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.821
Do you want to come?

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:22.023
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:24.055
Okay, perfect.
I'll text you.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.091
- Yeah, okay.
- Bye.

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:29.834
Yes.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:33.273
Concern turned to panic today
for residents of Hargrove County...

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:36.243
That afternoon we made
the mistake of watching the news.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:38.576
...as a serial killer claims his fourth
victim in as many months.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:41.674
Do you guys know this girl?

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.707
Not really.
I have friends who know her,

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.743
but I've never talked to her.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.654
In other news,
the industrial fire continues to rage...

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:51.091
The killer had taken another victim,

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.493
a cheerleader my age.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.497
He plucked her
from a charmed life

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.692
and left no clues.

01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:19.816
Meanwhile, the industrial fire
was still raging,

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:22.846
growing bigger every day.

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.952
As the toxic breeze
carried fumes our way,

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.020
some people had taken
to wearing masks.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.054
But I knew
their real purpose was

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.863
to provide the illusion
of defense.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:37.795
They put angels
in the electric chair...

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.638
There are some things
which are destined to occur

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.577
and nobody in the world
can do anything to stop it.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.979
And, oh, how we to and fro

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:52.545
To and fro, to and fro

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.960
Oh, how we
to and fro

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.087
To and fro, to and fro

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.598
This is our torched estates

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.728
This is our torched estates,
this is our torched estates

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.701
This is our torched estates.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.258
Mm.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:15.429
Oh shit.

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:18.304
Shit. Oh shit, I'm supposed
to be somewhere right now.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.934
Oh no, I'm not letting you
go anywhere.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.711
Come here.

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:25.236
You're mine.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.010
When did you get
so forceful?

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.681
- Bonjour.
- Oh. Oh.

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.218
Yes.

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.521
Impressed?

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.925
No.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.386
No. Are you crazy?

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.955
Hold on a minute. The line's going...
okay. Okay, talk soon.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.727
Hello.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:20.098
Do you have a minute to answer

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:22.330
a few quick questions
regarding our survey

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.430
against cancer?

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.175
- I guess, if it's quick.
- It will be, ma'am.

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:32.408
What is the annual income
of your household?

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.143
I'm not comfortable
sharing that.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.208
Well, is it above $150,000?

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:38.583
Yes.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.385
Well, do you consider yourself
a happy person?

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.256
God yeah.

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:47.956
Sure, as much as anyone.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.156
Hey, hon.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.134
Uh, just one final question...

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:57.161
what do you think
the end of the world will look like?

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.697
Who are you talking to?

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.801
What?

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.670
Barry, is that you?

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.476
Is that Barry?
Hang up the phone.

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:08.642
Barry, are you okay?
Everyone is worried about you.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.515
- Hang up. Don't call back here again.
- Just tell me if you're okay.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.577
Hang it up.

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:48.183
Hey, Mr. A,
I really like your new hair.

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:50.214
You look like Brad Pitt.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.522
Jenny, would you
close the door after you?

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.861
Thurston, I need to have a word.
Go ahead and have a seat.

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.924
Okay.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.419
What do you know?

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.052
Excuse me?

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:28.028
Do you know or not?

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:32.127
About your hair?
It looks good.

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.601
You don't know, do you?

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.501
I've been having sex
with Caroline.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:44.976
What?

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:50.010
I'm screwing her.
Fucking, banging... whatever it is

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.953
you kids call it these days,
that's what I'm doing to her.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.548
See, the thing is

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:58.526
she never even really
liked you at all, anyway.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.120
It was just that
we needed a cover.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.927
I know it's terrible
and I'm sorry.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.957
I know what you're thinking
right now as well.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.901
You're thinking
at the bottom of your heart

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.563
you knew it was
too good to be true.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:12.870
Well, turns out
you were right.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.513
Yeah.

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:38.623
Get it there.

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.830
- Huh?
- Yeah, looks good. One more.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.997
There's a black one.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.336
That's nice.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:46.932
Kind of cool.

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.772
- We can...
- Yeah.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.801
- We'll put it here.
- Looks like a new ball.

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:54.512
Hey, Thurston.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.484
- Get out of my house!
- What?

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:59.009
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:01.045
- No, don't touch me!
- What's happening?

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.387
How could you do it?
Why would you do it?!

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:06.258
Thurston, it's over.
I dumped him for you. It's over.

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.320
I don't care.
Just get out of my house, you slut.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.194
Don't you fucking call me that!

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.392
Language, people.

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.424
She's been cheating on me
the entire time!

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:16.335
I've just been a cover.

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.896
Is that true?

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.236
Yes, but it's...
no, not the whole time. It's over.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.304
Oh! I don't want to hear
your fucking excuses!

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.612
Just get the fuck away from me!

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.326
Oh, I'm so sorry, Enid.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.488
I was just trying
something stupid.

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.368
I think you'd better go.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.302
Could you...

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.449
tell Thurston I'm sorry?

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:02.814
Okay.

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.512
Bye, Lily.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:07.474
Yeah, I tell you,
this serial killer guy...

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.541
he's got it all wrong.

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:12.883
I mean, you want to know
how I'd kill someone?

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:15.082
Stab the fucker with an icicle...

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:17.216
wham!

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:19.625
Right through the heart.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:23.153
Where's the evidence?
It's melted.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.893
What if your weapon's water?

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:27.834
It's like 80% of the human body
and 2/3 of the earth's surface,

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:30.269
and it just ended your life.

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:33.571
And you didn't even drown.

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:39.045
Holy fucking shit,
it's the get-along gang.

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.180
I was about to finish
the keg myself.

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:46.085
You fucking pimp, dude.

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:08.974
No. No, I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:11.240
Come on, man.
You need to... you need to...

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.713
- All right.
- I miss the old you, man.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.740
I miss the old Craig.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:18.082
- Do you miss old Craig?
- There he is. There he is.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.645
He's back.
Old Craig is back, man.

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.781
What did you say to him?

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.084
What did you say to him?!

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:54.111
Caroline, we are meant
to be together.

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:57.257
Oh my God.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.226
You are fucking crazy.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.252
You know, what I find infuriating

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:04.094
is that you of all people are
bowing to social pressure now.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.828
Social pressure?
Are you kidding me?!

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:11.271
You think I'm someone I'm not.

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:16.839
I am going.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.812
If you leave, I'll kill him.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.806
I mean...
I don't mean that. I just...

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.978
but I might kill myself.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.011
I don't know. I just...

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:30.855
I'm really really confused
right now, Caroline.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.657
I'm gonna pretend
you never said that.

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.375
This is Thurston, so leave a message.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:53.407
Thurston, I'm so sorry
about what happened.

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:56.008
If you are at the party,
just stay at the party.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.212
I'm on my way right now.

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:01.654
I screwed up.
I know I screwed up.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.681
I just... I... please please

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:06.193
please don't do
anything stupid.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.924
I love y...

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.955
Fuck.

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.962
Hey, Thurston.

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.031
- What?
- Hey.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.810
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:28.873
Hey, do you want to see...
do you want to see the rest of my house?

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.578
Is it okay if I smoke in here?

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.280
Yeah. Do you want to...

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.185
sorry, do you want to see
the rest of my house?

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.849
Yeah, sure.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.290
Okay.

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:40.294
I'm so high.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:43.923
- So this is my... shit.
- Did you do all the decorations?

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.330
Fuck!

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.358
This is my bathroom.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.802
And then this is my dad's office.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.238
And this is some other stuff.

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.936
And...

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.603
this is my bedroom.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:21:59.978
Whoa.

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:03.674
You sure

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.982
really like unicorns, huh?

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.285
Yes, I love unicorns.

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:10.348
Cool.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:20.124
Thurston, I think you're so hot.

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.779
Wait, this is...

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.513
this feels very wrong.

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.714
Totally. Let me get the lights.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.481
Ugh!

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.992
Barry, you're a pussy.

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.688
You're a pussy, Barry.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.061
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:26.556
Oh shit!

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:33.631
Lily, come watch TV with me.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.700
Come watch the tube.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.695
This is wrong.
This is wrong.

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:03.795
This is wrong. This is wrong.
This is oh-so wrong.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.829
You try to be good
but you can't,

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.865
because it's all wrong.
It's all wrong.

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:10.639
It's all so fucking wrong!

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.827
Shit. Hello.

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:37.667
Caroline, it's me.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.935
I've shot myself.

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.738
The bullet skimmed my leg.
I think it's pretty bad.

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.541
Barry, I can't even hear you.
You're cracking up.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:49.016
Yeah, I know I'm cracking up!
I just shot myself, for Christ's sake!

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.677
Sorry, I can't hear you.

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:52.117
What?

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:53.620
No no no, Caroline. No.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.749
Caroline?

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.731
Lily, where are you?

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.437
Don't do this to me.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.714
This is fucking beautiful.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:30.485
Wait wait wait.

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.823
We should... we should stop.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.385
Why?

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.988
Because...

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.597
I don't know.

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.114
It wasn't my fault.

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.319
I know. I know.

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:49.057
The... the road's bad.
It's hard to see.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.191
No. It wasn't my fault.

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:56.735
I was raised to hate.

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:20.693
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.719
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:25.733
but I... I really have to go.

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.530
I have to go.

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.593
They caught him!
They caught the killer!

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:34.802
Barry.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.639
They finally caught him.

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:40.478
Oh. Caught who?

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.880
The killer.

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.713
Oh.

01:28:45.286 --> 01:28:47.254
How?

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:49.688
I think he, like,
crashed his car.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.784
What happened to you?

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:56.092
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.090
Do you want to come in
and have some dinner?

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:03.228
I have...
I have so much to share.

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.262
Barry, I...

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:08.764
I think you should
let me take you to the hospital.

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:11.401
Okay.

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:13.846
Um, but will you after?

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.208
You're in shock.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:23.017
Just say you'll have dinner
with me after.

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:25.917
Of course.

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.489
That would be a dream.

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:32.723
Okay.

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:38.264
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:39.637
Does it hurt?

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.733
Oh yeah, it hurts.

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.539
What happened?

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.273
I shot myself.

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:53.512
- You found them like this?
- Mmm.

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:04.621
There you stood

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:08.157
On the edge
of your feather

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:13.806
Expecting to fly...

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:19.173
When the serial killer died that night

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.976
everyone in the hospital cheered

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.983
and there was
even talk of a parade,

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:25.042
though it never happened.

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:29.815
From then on the whole town
considered me a hero,

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:33.793
but all I had really done was crash
my car into the right person.

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.956
By the summer

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:42.526
It was healing

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.970
We had said goodbye...

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.736
That was
the year that everything happened.

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.766
I'm not saying
if it was good or bad.

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:52.609
All the years
we'd spent with feeling

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:56.481
Ended with a cry...

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:59.077
I mean,
you can never really tell what's good

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.281
until later, anyway,

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:03.313
until you look back
and think about things

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.689
and they have time
to grow in your mind.

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:09.958
They

01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:13.592
Ended with a cry

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:23.206
I tried so hard to stand...

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:26.304
But sometimes
you make a choice in that moment

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:29.783
and you know in your heart
it's going to change everything.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.587
So hard to laugh

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.955
As I stumble

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.984
And reach for the love

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:45.727
I had found

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:51.534
Knowing it was gone

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:59.613
If I never lived
without you

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:02.878
Now you know I'd die...

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.412
Hi.

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:09.617
If I never said I loved you

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:13.320
- Now you know I'd try...
- You need to know he's out of my life

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:17.191
and I'm sorry

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.665
I screwed everything up.

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:24.136
Are you kidding me?

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.402
You saved me.

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:31.502
Now you know I'd try

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:35.642
Babe...

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:44.947
People will tell you nothing matters,

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.119
the whole world's about
to end soon anyway.

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:51.257
But those people are looking
at life the wrong way.

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:57.565
I mean, things don't need
to last forever

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.630
to be perfect.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:10.274
Live through this

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:14.516
And you won't look back

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:19.817
Live through this

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.229
And you won't look back

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.505
There's one thing I want to say

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.568
So I'll be brave

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.046
You were what I wanted

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:42.311
I gave what I gave

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.580
I'm not sorry I met you

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:48.144
I'm not sorry

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.589
There's nothing to save

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:30.127
Live through this

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:35.500
And you won't look back

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:39.529
Live through this

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:43.737
And you won't look back.
