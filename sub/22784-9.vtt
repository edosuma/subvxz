10:36.218 --> 10:39.972
And he cares about me in a way that...
no one ever has.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.140
Not even your parents?

He's a very nurturing parent.

-I got it <i>all</i> under wraps, Doc Jamison.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.582

no two lovers in one day,
no sex without a condom,

11:09.001 --> 11:12.213
-and no sex if it ain't in my lovin' bed.
-Got a lot of rules there.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.298
Gotta maintain some kinda control.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.718
Or what?
Let's go back to your art opening.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.679
-Do we have to? That was weeks ago.
-I know, I know,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.974
and I know it was tough,
but I think it's a great opportunity

11:24.058 --> 11:26.936
for us to examine your ability
to maintain control.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.522
-Or lack thereof.
-How'd it feel having all your lovers

11:29.605 --> 11:32.316
-in one space?
-Bananas! [chuckles]

11:32.400 --> 11:35.194
Like I was putting out a lot of fires.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.613
And what would have happened
if you just...

11:38.572 --> 11:39.698
let the fires burn?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.618
-I couldn't do that.
-But this was your big night.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.579
And instead of being present
for your art...

11:48.374 --> 11:50.167
I chose to put out the fires.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.003

12:19.780 --> 12:21.490
And I'm over here putting out fires?

12:21.574 --> 12:25.578
I don't want you to feel pressured
to choose, but the reality is...

12:26.078 --> 12:31.500
that each lover will most likely want more
of your time and heart and soul.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.338
But what will you have left for yourself?
For your art?

12:37.006 --> 12:40.426
Can I make a suggestion?
Opal was always very transparent with you.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.263
Maybe it's time to take a page
out of her book.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.852
Maybe full disclosure will help lift
this burden that you've been carrying...

12:50.978 --> 12:54.815
help you steer clear of making
your male lovers a three-headed monster.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.153

14:58.355 --> 15:00.941
that show what our own neighborhoods
look and feel like.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.943
You've cut out the things you like.

15:03.027 --> 15:07.156
Now, let's start to arrange them
in a creative way. Let's get to work.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.575
-Reggie, are you on your phone?
-But, Ms. Darling--

15:09.658 --> 15:13.037
-You know I do not allow phones--
-But, Ms. Darling, it's you.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.663
-What?
-[boy] That's really you?

15:15.873 --> 15:16.707
[Nola] Shit.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.334
Ooh!

15:18.417 --> 15:21.003
Shut up! Can't you see
she's already shook?

15:21.086 --> 15:24.131
-You famous now, Ms. Darling?
-Ms. Darling, how many likes you got?

15:24.214 --> 15:27.092
-Two thousand.
-[boy] Damn, yo!

15:27.176 --> 15:29.678
It's been a long time
since I've seen an artist like that.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.681
It reminds me of a poem.
It's beautiful in the space.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.684
-I really love it.
-Really, Clo? Really?

15:37.561 --> 15:40.189
I'm sorry, Tatyana.
Do you mind just giving us one second?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.358
-Sure.
-Thank you so much, thank you.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.778
Do we have a problem?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.782
<i>I've known Nola Darling</i>
<i>for quite some time,</i>

15:49.865 --> 15:53.327
<i>but once I saw her powerful campaign,</i>
<i>her </i>My Name Isn't,

15:53.410 --> 15:57.665
<i>I knew this street artist would be</i>
<i>the art world's next force of nature.</i>

15:57.748 --> 16:00.376
-You're welcome?
-I didn't want this out there.

16:00.459 --> 16:04.421
Really? 'Cause that post
got over 50,000 views.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.634
Do you know how many times
I've seen "My Name Isn't" as a hashtag?

16:08.717 --> 16:10.260
That's not the fucking point.

16:10.344 --> 16:14.056
-Well, then, what is the point?
-Look, I didn't-- Who told you?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.307
Who do you think?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.727
Mars. He was concerned
about how broke you've been.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.730
And I'm trying to understand
why you're so mad right now.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.024
-Street artist?
-Did I lie?

16:24.733 --> 16:30.030
It's one series of fucking work. It came
out of my assault. It's not who I am!

16:30.114 --> 16:31.991
Okay, well, who else would know this

16:32.074 --> 16:35.703
other than me, your parents, and the folks
that were here for the group show?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.538
You're a real talent.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.999
It's just time for you to shine.

16:40.916 --> 16:41.792
Not like this.

16:42.876 --> 16:47.006
Well, then how?
Like it or not, adversity serves you.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.594
It brings out the best of you,
and this is your best work yet.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.222
I just don't know why you kept this
from me for so long.

16:55.305 --> 17:00.102
I mean, it's so bold and fierce
and unapologetically feminist

17:00.185 --> 17:02.896
and fearlessly anti-misogynist.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.315
I mean, this should've been
at the group show.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.859
That's not for you to decide.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.611
Thanks to that post,
several people are interested.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.741
There's been a lot of inquiries
in the last hour alone.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.785
And one celebrity client,
who I can't really reveal his identity,

17:16.869 --> 17:21.331
but let's just say his name rhymes
with Shmenny Shmabitz.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.625
[laughing] Okay?

17:25.419 --> 17:26.962
You're not happy.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.130
No, I'm not.

17:28.213 --> 17:34.011
I just helped you launch your career
in a big way.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.514
Most artists would kill
for that kind of exposure,

17:37.598 --> 17:40.976
-and all you're giving me is an attitude.
-Because you never asked me, Clo.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.021
-Like you did with Mars?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

17:44.104 --> 17:47.232
How many times are you gonna
bring that up? Did you wanna share?

17:48.692 --> 17:49.526
Forget it.

17:50.486 --> 17:54.823
I did this because this was the boost
that you needed.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.452
Well, you don't know everything,
Clorinda Bradford.

17:59.495 --> 18:04.041
No, but I know more than you about how
this art world works, Ms. Darling.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.042
Word?

18:05.751 --> 18:09.379
You know me more than me?
Did you know I'm about to walk the fuck

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
out of the New Medina Gallery right now?

18:14.009 --> 18:18.555
Nola. Nola! Okay, what?
So, you're just gonna hide?

18:18.639 --> 18:20.432
Like some scared little girl?

18:20.516 --> 18:24.436
Nola, who do you think helped
put this red dot on the wall?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.646
Good luck with that.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.733

18:30.317 --> 18:32.152

18:32.569 --> 18:34.279
You gonna rescue me again?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.324
What's up, ma?
I get off in a few. We could--

18:37.407 --> 18:40.744
If I knew I couldn't confide
one bit of information to you,

18:40.828 --> 18:42.621
I would have never--

18:42.704 --> 18:44.998
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are we talkin' about?

18:45.082 --> 18:49.962
My street campaign, Mars.
I asked you not to tell anyone about it.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.631
-I can explain.
-I'm listening.

18:52.714 --> 18:56.385
First of all, my bad.
My intentions were 24 karat.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.596
Me and Clo just wanted to help you
with your art and commerce.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.181
I never asked for your help.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.852
I asked you to keep it between us,
but maybe--

19:04.935 --> 19:08.313
-Maybe? Maybe what?
-I care about you,

19:08.397 --> 19:12.109
and I know you care about me, but maybe
it's time we grow up, Mr. Childs.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.528
-Mr. Childs? What the fuck that mean?
-Fuck.

19:14.611 --> 19:18.240
-Yeah, I'm younger, but I ain't no child.
-No, it's just-- it's my Saturn return.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.577
Saturn return? Fuck Saturn!
I'm Mars and I'm here.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.788
I ain't been "ride or die" from jump?
I ain't had your back?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.665
-Yeah, you have, but--
-Nola, don't.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.421
Bygones. Let me get my bike.

19:32.504 --> 19:39.469
Let's ride from this present fuckery
into a Brooklyn sunset bliss.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.470
[chuckles]

19:40.804 --> 19:44.391
With you on the handle bars,
swingin' your cocoa legs.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.603
Wind blowin' in your shea butter kinks.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.648
Get sodie pop, artisanal popcorn,
then head back to your spot,

19:51.732 --> 19:55.360
have hot make-up sex.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.988
No. I got work to do.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.785
-But, Nola--
-Just let it go, Mars.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.122
It's was fun, right? It was fun.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.848
[in Spanish]

21:07.641 --> 21:10.102
-[in English] How you doin' today?
-All the stoops in Brooklyn,

21:10.185 --> 21:12.145
you gotta pick mine? [sighs]

21:12.229 --> 21:15.107
[Papo] Like Oscar Hammerstein
and Richard Rodgers wrote...

21:15.190 --> 21:17.192
"Oh, what a beautiful morning."

21:18.986 --> 21:20.696
-Really?
-Really what?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.198
-[Bianca] Are you kidding?
-Nola, you want space?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.951
-[both arguing]
-I'mma give it to you. I didn't want this.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.703
-You're bugging, okay?
-No, I'm not.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.122
-How 'bout, <i>"Buenos días,</i> Papo"?
-No, I'm not bugging.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.665
-This is--
-No <i>"buenos días"?</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:34.001
This is my home. This is my property.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.253
And you're gonna come
and spray stuff on it?

21:36.336 --> 21:38.588
I don't paint on your home,
or whatever that is.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.048
I make the neighborhood beautiful.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.260
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm sick of this. I'm calling the cops.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.512
-That's it.
-What are you calling the cops for?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.806
[both arguing]

21:47.889 --> 21:49.391
-[doorbell rings]
-This what you want?

21:49.474 --> 21:50.767
-We're done.
-Really?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.185
Don't even "really" with me.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.480
-[both arguing]
-[doorbell ringing]

21:56.064 --> 21:58.984
No, every day,
I open my door and you're here.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.570
-Where am I supposed to go?
-I can't even sleep...

22:01.653 --> 22:03.113
I was born and raised here.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.074
This is my block.
This is where I've been all my life.

22:06.158 --> 22:11.913
-[both arguing]
-What's goin' on?

22:11.997 --> 22:15.125
-Yo, all jokes aside...
-[siren wailing]

22:15.208 --> 22:17.794
Oh, my God,
you actually did call the cops.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.254
[Nola] No, Mars.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.089
-What is goin' on?
-[siren wailing]

22:21.173 --> 22:22.507
You left me no choice.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.718
-Somebody call?
-Yes, I did.

22:24.801 --> 22:25.886
What's the problem?

22:25.969 --> 22:28.930
-This man defaced my property.
-Lady, I ain't do nothin'.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.223
Bianca, what are you doing?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.934
-I want you to arrest him.
-For what? For being homeless?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.854
-I'm not homeless, just in transition.
-You're right.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.648
-All right, sir, sir, can I see some ID?
-What happened?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.484
I thought stop-and-frisk was over.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.070
-It's a new day in America.
-[in Spanish]

22:43.153 --> 22:46.740
Okay, officer? I was pushing my cart
down the street, like I do every day,

22:46.823 --> 22:49.534
-minding my own business--
-You're scoping out your new victims?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.537
You know what? Why don't you
go through his trashy cart?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.290
I am sure you are going
to find green spray paint.

22:55.373 --> 22:58.043
-Don't call my art cart "trash."
-Papo is harmless, officer.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.836
-He's the mayor of our block.
-Easy.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.796
-Exactly.
-Yes.

23:00.879 --> 23:07.344
My stoop has been defaced two times
with this "G" for "gentrification,"

23:07.427 --> 23:09.221
which is reverse racism.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.515
-[all shouting]
-Okay, really?

23:11.598 --> 23:14.893
-He is the one who's responsible for it!
-I didn't do anything.

23:14.976 --> 23:18.355
Sir, sir, sir, we already asked you once.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.899
Stand up nice and slowly
and show me some ID.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.610
-Why would he have ID?
-Stay out of it.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.404
Come on. Just want to see your ID.
Have a wallet?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.198
Go easy.
Just wanna ask you a few questions.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.867
-Yo, he didn't do nothing, man.
-No ID? Not good.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.620
-[Nola] Papo?
-What's going on?

23:33.703 --> 23:35.872
-Papo, are you okay? Papo?
-[man] Papo?

23:35.956 --> 23:37.749
Could you officers just, like...
Could you...

23:37.833 --> 23:40.127
-Whoa, he's...
-Could you back up a little bit?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.920
Maybe just give him some space?

23:42.003 --> 23:46.007
-Chill, chill, chill.
-Look, just-- I did it! Okay? I did it.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.802
-What'd you say, ma'am?
-Bianca, I defaced your brownstone.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.554
We all know this was Papo.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.181
-This was not you.
-Nola, what are you talkin' about?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.517
-I said I did it.
-Stop saying that.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.813
Let's go. We'll take a ride to the 87th.
Let's go, pal. We're going to the 87th.

23:59.896 --> 24:04.234
-Look, just cuff me! Cuff me! Cuff me!
-Yo, stop! What are you doing?

24:04.317 --> 24:05.569
-Wait. Cuff you?
-Cuff me.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.778
-That what you want?
-Yes.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.656

24:09.739 --> 24:11.241

Where you think you're goin'?

24:19.416 --> 24:20.250
I'm going home.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.837
No, no, no. You made the complaint.
You're comin' too. All three of youse.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.922
-Chill, man. You're hurting her, man.
-Okay.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.717
-First, let me lock my door. I'm coming.
-Everything's fine.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.760
Ahh! Okay, okay! They're tight!

24:30.844 --> 24:33.305
She didn't anything, man!
You don't gotta arrest her!

24:33.388 --> 24:34.222
[Mars] Nola!

24:34.306 --> 24:36.850
I'm gonna call your parents.
You hear me, Nola?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.977
-Okay.
-She didn't do nothin'!

24:39.060 --> 24:40.896
-Tryin' to tell you!
-[officer] Back inside.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.733
[Mars] Dude, I'm not going inside!
Yo, that's my girl! Yo, officers!

[both, in Spanish]

24:48.570 --> 24:50.071
[overlapping chatter]

24:50.155 --> 24:52.991
This doesn't seem right.
I'm not the one who did anything.

24:53.074 --> 24:57.245
So, she get VIP access?
Y'all got bottle service in that cop car?

24:57.329 --> 25:00.957
Are you serious? What are you doin'?
Yo, my man, don't treat him like that!

25:01.041 --> 25:02.959
-What's goin' on?
-[officer] Nothin' to see here.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.213
What the fuck you mean there's nothin'
to see here? And everybody's watchin'!

25:06.296 --> 25:08.965
-Everybody, take it easy, step back.
-Everybody, go home. Let's go.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.091
Everybody's takin' it easy!

-Get back on the sidewalk.
-I am on the sidewalk!

25:12.719 --> 25:14.512
-You usin' your eyes?
-Shut your mouth.

25:14.596 --> 25:18.975
Yo, this motherfucker just told me
