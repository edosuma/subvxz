38:08.954 --> 38:11.039
[ YAWNING ]

38:11.081 --> 38:14.459
WHAT AN EGO BRUISER.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.212
THREE TURN-DOWNS

38:14.500 --> 38:17.212
IN ONE NIGHT.

38:17.254 --> 38:18.546
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG

38:17.254 --> 38:18.546
WITH OUR PITCH?

38:18.588 --> 38:20.673
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

38:18.588 --> 38:20.673
WITH YOU GUYS.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.469
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

38:20.715 --> 38:24.469
IT'S THE NEW MALE.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.012
WHAT?

38:26.054 --> 38:27.139
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

38:26.054 --> 38:27.139

38:27.180 --> 38:28.681
I MEAN, YOU'VE NEVER EVEN

38:27.180 --> 38:28.681
BEEN WITH A MAN.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.058
WELL, THE NEW MALE

38:28.723 --> 38:30.058
IS MORE SPIRITUAL

38:30.100 --> 38:31.059
THAN THE OLD MALE.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.685
YOU KNOW, HE SEES HIS SPERM

38:32.727 --> 38:34.771
AS AN EXTENSION

38:32.727 --> 38:34.771
OF HIS INNER BEING.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.232
WHEREAS THE OLD MALE

38:34.813 --> 38:37.232
SHOT INTO ANY FEMALE

38:37.274 --> 38:39.151
WITHOUT THINKING

38:37.274 --> 38:39.151
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN,

38:39.192 --> 38:42.154
THE NEW MALE TOTALLY CARES

38:39.192 --> 38:42.154
WHAT BECOMES OF HIS SEED.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.906
OH, MY GOD, IT'S YODA.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.829
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO GET

38:48.618 --> 38:50.829
ALL SENSITIVE ON US

38:50.870 --> 38:52.247
JUST WHEN WE

38:50.870 --> 38:52.247
NEEDED THEM

38:52.289 --> 38:54.415
TO KEEP ON BEING

38:52.289 --> 38:54.415
THE SAME OLD ASSHOLES?

38:56.375 --> 38:57.418
I DON'T KNOW.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.254
ALL RIGHT.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.338
YEAH, WE'RE GOING

38:59.296 --> 39:00.338

I'M SORRY.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.231
OH, MY GOD.

GET OFF OF ME.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.565

39:18.273 --> 39:19.565
THE PARTY'S OVER.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.026
WE CAN GO BACK

39:19.607 --> 39:21.026
TO BEING GAY.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.110
I GOT TO GO.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.904
YOU GUYS NEED HELP

39:22.152 --> 39:24.904

39:35.456 --> 39:36.666
GOOD NIGHT.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.313
OH, SHIT.

39:58.355 --> 40:01.316
HOW LONG HAVE YOU

39:58.355 --> 40:01.316
BEEN OUT HERE?

40:02.817 --> 40:05.528
I COULDN'T SLEEP

40:02.817 --> 40:05.528
LAST NIGHT.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.989
YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.993
YEAH, WELL,

40:08.031 --> 40:11.993
SOMEBODY WORE ME OUT.

40:12.035 --> 40:17.123
I CAME OUT HERE

40:12.035 --> 40:17.123
AROUND 3:00...

40:17.165 --> 40:19.209
IN THE MORNING,

40:19.251 --> 40:22.337
AND THEN I STARTED

40:19.251 --> 40:22.337
TO WRITE,

40:22.379 --> 40:26.007
AND THAT WAS

40:22.379 --> 40:26.007
SO SCARY.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.968
IT'S A WHOLE

40:26.049 --> 40:28.968
NEW PLACE, JEN.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.178
IT'S JUST GOING

40:29.010 --> 40:30.178
TO TAKE YOU A WHILE

40:30.220 --> 40:32.513
TO FIND YOUR GROOVE.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.515
YEAH.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.063
YOU KNOW,

40:37.894 --> 40:40.063
YOU NEVER TOLD ME

40:40.105 --> 40:42.774
WHY YOU WERE SO UPSET

40:40.105 --> 40:42.774
LAST NIGHT.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.860
UM...

40:45.902 --> 40:49.697
BECAUSE I WAS JUST

40:45.902 --> 40:49.697
A LITTLE DRUNK.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.908
I HOPE I DIDN'T

40:49.739 --> 40:51.908
RUIN YOUR NIGHT.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.576
NO, I THINK

40:51.950 --> 40:53.576
IT TURNED OUT

40:53.618 --> 40:54.660
PRETTY WELL.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.661
OKAY.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.662

41:13.430 --> 41:16.515
THAT FUCKING PARTY

41:13.430 --> 41:16.515
MADE ME SO DEPRESSED.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.600
WE HAVE TO WAIT

41:16.557 --> 41:17.600
A WHOLE MONTH

41:17.642 --> 41:18.851
BEFORE ANOTHER

41:17.642 --> 41:18.851
INSEMINATION.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.853
AT LEAST YOU HAVE

41:18.893 --> 41:20.853
SOMEBODY TO WAIT WITH.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.773
AT LEAST THERE'S SOMEBODY

41:22.397 --> 41:23.773
IN BED NEXT TO YOU

41:23.815 --> 41:25.191

45:49.205 --> 45:51.874

45:51.916 --> 45:54.419
I WILL SIGN THE DONOR'S

46:52.226 --> 46:54.479
OH, NO, NO, NO,

46:52.226 --> 46:54.479
WE DON'T DO THAT WAY.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.522
WE DO AS A MAN AND A WOMAN.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.899
OH, JEAN PAUL,

46:56.564 --> 46:58.899
I'M SORRY,

46:58.941 --> 47:01.527
I JUST THOUGHT

46:58.941 --> 47:01.527
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT...

47:01.569 --> 47:03.028
DO YOU WANT IT

47:01.569 --> 47:03.028
TO BE ALL THREE?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.113
BECAUSE THAT

47:03.070 --> 47:04.113
WOULD BE FINE.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.698
IT IS GOING TO BE

47:04.155 --> 47:05.698
YOUR BABY, TOO.

47:05.740 --> 47:06.907
NO.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.493
NO? JUST ME

47:06.949 --> 47:08.493
AND HER THEN.  BON.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.663
JEAN PAUL, NOT ONLY

47:08.534 --> 47:11.663
ARE WE MONOGAMOUS,

47:11.704 --> 47:13.080
WE DON'T

47:11.704 --> 47:13.080
SLEEP WITH MEN.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.792
BUT TO HAVE A BABY,

47:13.122 --> 47:15.792
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

47:15.832 --> 47:19.420
IT'S JUST NOT AN OPTION

47:15.832 --> 47:19.420
FOR US, OKAY?

47:19.462 --> 47:22.548
BUT FOR ME,

47:19.462 --> 47:22.548
IT IS THE ONLY OPTION.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.300
AN OBLIGATION.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.010
I COULD NOT BRING A BABY

47:24.342 --> 47:26.010
INTO THIS WORLD

47:26.051 --> 47:29.555
WHO WAS NOT CONCEIVED

47:26.051 --> 47:29.555
THROUGH THE PASSIONATE...

47:29.597 --> 47:30.598
MM, MM...

47:30.640 --> 47:33.434
BETWEEN A MAN

47:30.640 --> 47:33.434
AND A WOMAN.

47:39.524 --> 47:40.483
HEY!

47:40.525 --> 47:43.152
THE PENIS. THE PUSSY.

47:40.525 --> 47:43.152
THE BABY.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.153
YOU KNOW?

47:44.195 --> 47:47.490
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.575
"ZE PENIS, ZE PUSSY,

47:47.532 --> 47:49.575
ZE BABY"?

47:50.993 --> 47:53.579
OH, GOD, I SWEAR...

47:55.540 --> 47:56.957
COME ON, TEE, IT'S FUNNY.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.418
I'M SORRY,

47:56.999 --> 47:59.418
I DON'T FIND IT FUNNY.

48:01.713 --> 48:03.214
WELL, TRY.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.174
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SENSE

48:03.255 --> 48:05.174
OF HUMOR ABOUT THESE THINGS.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.551
OH, WELL, I GUESS

48:06.592 --> 48:08.302
YOU'LL JUST TAKE CARE OF THAT

48:06.592 --> 48:08.302
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.226
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

48:16.893 --> 48:17.894
WHAT? WHAT AM I DOING?

48:34.995 --> 48:36.121
WE GOT MARY,

I THINK I'M GOING TO DITCH RANDY

48:45.464 --> 48:47.299
AND TAKE YOU OUT MYSELF.

48:47.341 --> 48:48.342

48:47.341 --> 48:48.342

48:48.384 --> 48:49.385
'CAUSE WE GOT

48:49.427 --> 48:52.221
A SHITLOAD

48:49.427 --> 48:52.221

48:52.263 --> 48:53.681
BUT YOU DO LOOK GREAT.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.681
THANK YOU.

48:53.723 --> 48:55.224
I'M NOT GOING

48:53.723 --> 48:55.224
TO BE LATE.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.475
OKAY.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.102
OKAY.

49:00.145 --> 49:01.564
GOOD-BYE.

49:04.609 --> 49:05.651

49:15.994 --> 49:19.039

49:19.081 --> 49:20.332
AND YOU'RE LETTING HER

49:19.081 --> 49:20.332
GO ALONE?

49:20.374 --> 49:21.793
I'M MAKING HER GO.

49:21.834 --> 49:24.211
SHE DOESN'T KNOW

49:21.834 --> 49:24.211
THAT MANY PEOPLE.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.589
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT,

49:24.253 --> 49:26.589
BUT SHE'S KIND OF A RECLUSE.

49:30.551 --> 49:31.761

50:16.555 --> 50:17.598
HOW ARE YOU?

50:17.640 --> 50:18.975

50:25.397 --> 50:27.232
I'M GOING TO GO PLAY POOL,

50:27.274 --> 50:29.360
SO SEE YOU ALL

50:27.274 --> 50:29.360
LATER.

50:29.401 --> 50:31.027
YOU SHOULD HAVE

50:29.401 --> 50:31.027
HIT ON HER

50:31.069 --> 50:32.196
WHEN WE FIRST CAME IN.

50:32.237 --> 50:33.531
I DON'T GET IT.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.283
I MEAN, WHAT DOES SHANE HAVE

50:33.572 --> 50:36.283
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

50:36.325 --> 50:37.869
IT HAS TO DO

50:36.325 --> 50:37.869
WITH HER ATTITUDE.

50:37.910 --> 50:39.244
I'VE GOT ATTITUDE.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.746
IT'S BECAUSE

50:39.286 --> 50:40.746
SHE'S SO WITHHOLDING.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.080
NO.

50:42.122 --> 50:43.457
IT'S BECAUSE

50:42.122 --> 50:43.457
SHE'S SO CONFIDENT.

50:43.499 --> 50:44.876
NO, IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S STUPID,

50:44.917 --> 50:46.251
AND STUPID PEOPLE

50:44.917 --> 50:46.251
ARE TOO DUMB TO BE INSECURE.

50:46.293 --> 50:47.962
DANA, SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

50:48.004 --> 50:49.338
IT'S CONFIDENCE,

50:48.004 --> 50:49.338
OKAY?

50:49.380 --> 50:50.381
I'M TELLING YOU.

50:50.422 --> 50:51.716
AND IT'S BECAUSE

50:50.422 --> 50:51.716
OF HER NIPPLES.

50:51.757 --> 50:52.884
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

50:51.757 --> 50:52.884
IT'S BECAUSE OF HER NIPPLES?

50:52.925 --> 50:53.926
SHE HAS THE BEST

50:52.925 --> 50:53.926
NIPPLES IN TOWN,

50:53.968 --> 50:54.927
AND SHE KNOWS IT.

50:54.969 --> 50:56.345
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.513
SHE HAS NIPPLE CONFIDENCE.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.681
THEY ARE NICE.

50:58.723 --> 50:59.891
YEAH,

50:58.723 --> 50:59.891
THEY'RE SMALL

50:59.932 --> 51:01.308
AND THEY'RE

50:59.932 --> 51:01.308
PERFECTLY FORMED.

51:01.350 --> 51:04.269
I WONDER IF I COULD SELL A STORY

51:01.350 --> 51:04.269
ON L.A.'S BEST NIPPLES.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.521

51:05.563 --> 51:08.733
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA

51:05.563 --> 51:08.733
WANDER AROUND FOR A BIT.

51:08.774 --> 51:09.734
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
