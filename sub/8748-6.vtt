10:20.187 --> 10:22.454
HOW DO YOU WIN THIS THING
EVERY YEAR?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.657
I TOLD YOU IN THE BREAK ROOM,
"I OWN THESE AWARDS."

10:25.659 --> 10:27.058
WHAT?

10:27.060 --> 10:30.395
NO, I-I LEGALLY OWN THEM.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.132
SEE? I FUND THEM.
I CONCEIVED OF THEM.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.400
THEY'RE MY AWARDS.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.335
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.404
UH-HUH.
THAT WRAPS THAT UP.
YEAH.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.040
BE BEATING A DEAD HORSE
IF WE WENT ANY FURTHER.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.942
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HERD UP
AND HEAD OUT.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.243
OH, HEY, CHET.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.212
SO HOW WAS
YOUR VEGAS TRIP?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.080
PRETTY GOOD.
YEAH, YEAH.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.515
I HAD A LITTLE PROGRESS

10:50.517 --> 10:52.651
BECOMING FRIENDS
WITH SOMEONE I NEVER --

10:53.953 --> 10:56.788
WOW! I'M REALLY GETTING
FEELING BACK IN MY ARM.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.123
