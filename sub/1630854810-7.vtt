WEBVTT

00:20.687 --> 00:21.521
Ah.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.071
-Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.160
Ooh, that was fast.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.247
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.249
All right.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.375
Ah shit!

00:47.338 --> 00:48.631
Follow that Bentley.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.390
Mm. Ooh.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.309
Mm. Mm. Mm.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.650
Hello?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.486
<i>I have information</i>
<i>on the missing woman.</i>

01:09.569 --> 01:12.489
<i>The woman you're looking for</i>
<i>is renting out a room in my house.</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:13.615
Tonio?

01:13.698 --> 01:15.950
Who is this?
And why do you know someone named Tonio?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.160
It's your niece!

01:17.243 --> 01:18.495
-Ines?
<i>-Gloria!</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:20.371
<i>Why don't you have my number</i>
<i>in your phone?</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:23.625
And did you say Mariluna
is renting a room in our house?

01:23.708 --> 01:25.418
Only during school hours.

01:25.502 --> 01:29.756
But before I answer any more questions,
let's discuss the reward.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.135
Oh! Okay, now follow that Bentley.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.293
What do you want?

02:07.377 --> 02:10.004
What do <i>I</i> want? What do <i>you</i> want?

02:10.088 --> 02:13.550
Why are you crashing my parties
and creeping around my house?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.385
-You know about the creeping?
-Yes.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.346
And before either of us
ask any more questions,

02:18.429 --> 02:21.516
why don't you get
that tacky, fake-ass sword out of my face

02:21.599 --> 02:23.518
and offer me a glass of water?

02:23.601 --> 02:25.311
I am thirsty AF.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.314
Okay.

02:33.069 --> 02:33.987
Come in.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.617
I'm not saying I'm against dolphin
training because they do like to learn,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.579
but if I were the one training the
dolphins, it'd be more of a partnership.

02:42.662 --> 02:46.207
I'd leave the ocean gates open.
They could come and go as they please.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
Cam, are you listening?

02:47.375 --> 02:51.171
How did Andre get a new boyfriend so fast
when just days ago, he was lambasting me?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.506
And Cheetos?
He's allergic to powdered cheeses!

02:53.590 --> 02:56.092
-I'm glad Andre found someone.
-But so fast?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.220
No, not possible. They must have been
a thing before we broke up.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.346
He is a hypocrite.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.350
Or he wasn't cheating,
and it's just karmic coincidence.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.395
That's when something bad happens,
i.e. our cheating,

03:07.478 --> 03:09.063
to a good person, i.e. Andre.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.735
So the universe rewards said good person
with something good, i.e. Benji.

03:13.818 --> 03:17.405
Uh, TBD on that. Benji looks dirty.
Not in the good way.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.533
Wait. This karmic coincidence…
You just make that up?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.827
No, I… I would tell you to look it up,

03:22.911 --> 03:26.456
but you can't because not all star witches
like to write things down.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.750
Benji, let me get that for you.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.174
That is the cutest gag reflex
I've ever seen.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.094
Don't hate Benji. Be thankful for him.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.640
Now we don't have to fondle each other
under that dark cloud of retribution.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Don't!

03:48.394 --> 03:50.688
I have to. I need proof of the hypocrisy!

03:50.772 --> 03:53.024
-To do what?
-To feel vindicated.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.525
Andre called me a terrible person.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.363
I need proof that he's a terrible person,
and then we can be together guilt-free.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.827
I did something. Something bad.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.457
I snagged Gloria's BuJo,
and it's disturbing.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.377
I know. Who schedules out
their bathroom breaks?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.087
That's a UTI waiting to happen.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.256
I told her when you gotta tinkle,
let it sprinkle.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.423
Is that a gravestone?

04:17.507 --> 04:19.425
And why does it say "alive"?

04:20.635 --> 04:21.594
I know what this is.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
Your sister got a premonition
and she wouldn't tell me what it was,

04:24.389 --> 04:26.599
but she was highly disturbed by it, and…

04:27.267 --> 04:28.893
She didn't write it down.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.063
She said she wrote down the premonition,

04:32.146 --> 04:35.817
but, see, this is an interpretation
that frankly isn't very good.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.902
-So she didn't seal the fate.
-Translation, please?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.320
To seal the fate of a premonition,

04:39.404 --> 04:41.739
you have to write it down
or take a picture-- No!

04:41.823 --> 04:42.740
Ow!

04:43.825 --> 04:44.742
Why did you do that?

04:44.826 --> 04:47.870
Because shit just got really real.
Damn it, Ines.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.374
Now we need to figure out what
the premonition is and how to unseal it.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.335
Let's go. I'm calling Gloria.
She's gotta tell us what Cinnamon said.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.129
Oh!

04:56.921 --> 04:59.966
-Why isn't Gloria picking up?
-To annoy you. That's what she does to me.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.260
Let's just go to my house and ask her.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.095
We will, but I think
Cinnamon's our next step.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.847
How are we gonna contact her?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.725
All we have is TikTok,
and she doesn't respond to any of her DMs.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.978
-I know a Cinnamon.
-Mind your business, Davina!

05:12.061 --> 05:14.105
-Cinnamon!
-Yo, what's up?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.696
Karmic coincidence.

05:28.202 --> 05:33.041
Interesting style.
It's very <i>Great Expectations.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:34.876
Miss Havisham?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.419
Hmm, don't know her.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.714
It's potpourri to mask the scent.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.467
I'm not sure anything is being masked.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.637
-Who's turning 50?
-My husband was, but he's dead.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.223
Did you kill him?

05:49.307 --> 05:52.018
No, my husband died
from the faulty brakes in my car.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.854
-He died the day of the party.
-Which trapped you in time.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.148
It is just this one room. Do not judge me.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.275
I won't judge,
but I do have more questions.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.986
-Why have you been renting out my room?
-For the box.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.447
I tried trailing you and your friends,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.616
but you were all so squirrelly,
and I'm tired--

06:06.699 --> 06:09.243
What's with the box? Why do you need it?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.371
And why have you cursed it and now us?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.539
What's your best color?

06:14.832 --> 06:15.750
Hm?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.377
This is so random.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.839
No, it's not. Brows are my side hustle.
Or more like my second main hustle.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.426
I don't like to rank my callings,
but I do like to rank my premonitions,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.221
and I remember liking the ones
that revealed themselves to you.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.391
Yeah, about that. Can we get more clarity
on them 'cause they're coming true?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.392
They are?

06:33.226 --> 06:37.438
Oh my God, I did it.
Wait, I really did it? I predicted shit?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.315
Hot twat!

06:40.149 --> 06:42.235
Truth is, I'm only intermediate
in my skills,

06:42.318 --> 06:44.779
so, uh, this is really encouraging.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.990
-Which premo did you want more clarity on?
-The one you gave my sister.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.077
-In private.
-In private?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.497
Oh! When I was coming out of the bathroom?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.126
Yeah. Real proud of that bad boy.
It hit me hard.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.919
What did?

07:00.002 --> 07:01.546
That someone's gonna die.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.423
Who's gonna die?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.591
I don't know. I can't see who it is.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.512
I just get bits of info
like an abbreviated text.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.722
If you need more help, see an expert.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.017
-All right, Davina, let's whack that bush!

07:15.101 --> 07:17.520
In my room, please.
I don't wax where I eat.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.021
Right.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.692
We need another witch.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.862
Preferably one who's not on the Internet
and has a real cauldron.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.739
Yeah, you're right.
I mean, not all witches are made alike.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.659
-Some witches are brilliant--
-Some witches be bonkers.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.953
Hey, look who has basic witch knowledge.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.038
-Yeah.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.874
-Hey.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.210
I know we're supposed to meet up
after school, but I can't make it.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.212
-<i>Me neither.</i>
-Great. Okay, bye.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.006
-Cam, you okay?
-<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

07:45.089 --> 07:47.842
I've just had enough people time
for the day. Yeah.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.934
-You was lying. No!
-That's what I'm saying.

07:57.018 --> 07:57.852
Oh!

07:59.520 --> 08:01.439
-Exactly.
-It's true!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.275
I do.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.318
Yeah, okay.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.408
So you and the dead lady were twins?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.869
Identical and inseparable.

08:14.952 --> 08:19.123
We used to pretend to be each other,
which made for an extra special surprise

08:19.207 --> 08:21.792
when I discovered her friend Isabel
was not just a friend.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.710
Oh.

08:22.793 --> 08:26.464
You see, when I was younger,
I was even more stunning.

08:26.547 --> 08:30.343
I had perky breasts and an ass you could
bounce… money off of!

08:30.426 --> 08:32.929
-And the box?
-Tight. It could launch a thousand ships.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.180
Because of the curse?

08:34.263 --> 08:36.307
Different box.
I'm talking about my vagina.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.850
-Got it. You were hot.
-Very.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.560
Wealthy men were always
trying to marry me.

08:39.644 --> 08:44.607
I never fell for them until
I met an American man named Henry Fo--

08:44.690 --> 08:45.733
Henry Ford?

08:45.816 --> 08:48.069
…man. Fordman.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.488
How old do you think I am?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.114
A hundred?

08:53.783 --> 08:56.661
He was perfect,
except for this teeny, tiny quirk he had

08:56.744 --> 09:00.164
where he insisted I disown
my working-class family and heritage.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.332
What?

09:01.832 --> 09:02.750
That's effed up!

09:02.833 --> 09:06.879
It was, but he had a yacht
and a giant wang.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.215
Eventually, you saw past that,
and you killed him?

09:09.298 --> 09:10.216
No! No!

09:10.299 --> 09:15.263
On his 50th, the car he was driving caught
on fire, which was really bad timing

09:15.346 --> 09:17.974
because I was taking
all those pyro classes.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.311
It is a little bit of an eyesore.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.355
And a huge health code violation.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.024
Maybe it is time to tidy up.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.860
On it. Keep talking.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.989
Anyway, all I wanted was my family.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.533
I missed Marisol.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.995
I knew she was in Freeridge,
and I had invited her to Henry's party,

09:39.078 --> 09:40.871
but that beautiful bitch never showed.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.123
And the box?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.333
Oh, right, the box.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.168
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

09:46.252 --> 09:48.796
I gave the box to my sister
when I left with Henry.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.339
So the fact that she kept it

09:50.423 --> 09:53.342
means she didn't
completely write me off and…

09:54.844 --> 09:56.762
That's all I've got. The end. Finale.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.097
So the box is cursed

09:58.180 --> 10:01.809
because you never got to see your sister
after you gave it to her!

10:01.892 --> 10:04.729
Oh, that's a really good theory! But no.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.689
The curse was our inside joke.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.400
Telling people things were cursed
just made us laugh!

10:09.483 --> 10:11.277
I love pranks and games!

10:17.742 --> 10:18.951
Humor is subjective.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.078
So the box isn't cursed.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.622
Of course not.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.000
Oh shit. My phone's dead.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.377
Do you need a ride home now?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.214
Nah. No one's looking for me.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.883
<i>Gloria still isn't picking up!</i>

10:33.966 --> 10:35.885
God. What if I am
the one who's gonna die?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.762
Everything about me says
"resting victim face."

10:37.845 --> 10:38.721
I can see that.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.598
This is your fault! Why did you hug me?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.433
Because the universe told me to.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.186
Well, then ask the freaking universe
if this is it.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.563
Is it me?
Am I the one who's gonna get creamed?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.316
I'm sorry, girl. I don't really know.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.443
You need help from a stronger source,

10:52.526 --> 10:54.737
a full-time witch
who doesn't have a side hustle.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.073
Where am I gonna find
this pedigreed mystic?

10:58.532 --> 11:02.453
Mm. Be right back. Joker isn't ready yet,
and he wants me to come inside.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.043
Karmic coincidence!

11:12.755 --> 11:14.882
It's gonna be a little longer.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.968
Joker's getting a cosmic cleanse,
which removes his emotional walls

11:18.052 --> 11:19.428
and turns him super clingy.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.847
So I gotta get back there
and hold his hand.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.184
-Oh.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.602
Look.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.688
Worry Away.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.075
Hey, are you the one that wants to know
your unborn baby's past life?

11:41.158 --> 11:42.576
You're pregnant?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.746
What? No. We're just looking for a friend.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.124
No, you're worried.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.293
Sorry, we couldn't help ourselves.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.087
It's really nice. What's in it?

11:53.170 --> 11:54.004
Goat.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.841
-Which part?
-All of it.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.593
Oh.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.058
You're here to see me!

12:06.851 --> 12:08.602
Back room, now!

12:09.395 --> 12:11.230
-Quick! Come on!
-Yes.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.565
Am I gonna die?

12:12.648 --> 12:15.192
'Cause her sister got a premonition
that someone was gonna die.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.280
I am sensing an impending death,
but it is not either of you.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.324
-Are you sure?
-I am a post-mortem <i>bruja.</i>

12:22.408 --> 12:26.454
I help the living cope with the dead,
the dead transition from the living,

12:26.537 --> 12:28.330
and all that comes in between.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.498
Like a medium?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.667
No, not like a medium.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.254
This is more specialized and intense.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.550
I mean, no offense to my medium friends,
but what I do involves skill.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.509
Oh.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.220
What the hell?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.099
Those were not there when I sat down!

12:47.183 --> 12:49.602
Stay calm. They smell the goat.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.312
What are they?

12:51.395 --> 12:52.521
Dead.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.441
When I was working toward
a major in ceramic arts,

12:55.524 --> 12:58.611
I started minoring
in post-modern mysticism,

12:58.694 --> 13:02.448
and I realized that
I could merge the two crafts

13:02.531 --> 13:05.034
and soul bind with these little vessels.

13:05.701 --> 13:09.371
They help the spirits transition
and the loved ones left behind.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.332
Oh, you see that bowl over there?

13:11.415 --> 13:13.918
That is my <i>tío,</i> Emilio.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.711
He died before I mastered the wheel.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.548
At the time, I thought it might be nice
to mourn a loved one by eating on them.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.133
Oh.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.093
Is that you?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.970
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.555
-Are you dead?

13:26.639 --> 13:27.765
Only on the inside.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.558
Breakups can feel like a death,

13:29.642 --> 13:33.521
so I made that for Chivo, my ex,
when we broke up.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.314
-Was it recent?
-Oh, no!

13:35.397 --> 13:36.982
No, it was years ago.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.152
That is the replacement
for the replacement,

13:40.236 --> 13:43.197
which he will inevitably break
since he broke the original.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.283
He was a little handsy.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.119
God, I miss that.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.790
Why'd you break up?

13:52.873 --> 13:58.212
Well, because sometimes you can
love someone and not be good for them.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.342
Uh, we're getting off-topic.
Let's talk curse.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.177
-Are we cursed?
-Yes.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.806
-From the box?
-No and yes.

14:08.889 --> 14:09.765
Which is it?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.475
Curses come in two ways.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.770
The ones that are put upon you,
and the ones you put upon yourself.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.440
See, the box was not cursed,
but your belief in it made it real,

14:18.524 --> 14:20.317
but now you don't believe, so it's not.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.819
Make sense?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.279
So we're not cursed?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.613
No.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.075
We're not cursed!

14:28.158 --> 14:30.870
Hey, are you done? 'Cause I'm not.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.163
Oh.

14:34.665 --> 14:40.880
Now, in the process of undoing this curse,
you might have brought upon another one.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.797
Might have?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.549
Only time will tell.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.302
Well, then we just won't believe in it.
Boom, done.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.137
-Huh.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.061
Oh, he likes you. Take a chip.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.521
I don't want one.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.857
Take the chip, or he will be offended.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.618
-Are you sure you have to go?
-Mm-hmm.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.412
We can play some games. I have chess.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.540
Backgammon? Checkers?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.959
-Connect Four?
-Sorry.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.044
I have that too!

15:23.631 --> 15:24.590
It's just…

15:25.758 --> 15:29.386
It was really nice having some company.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.347
I've been so lonely for so long.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.476
I miss my sister.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.271
I wish I'd seen her before she died.
I wish I'd gotten to know her family.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.275
-You know they're still alive, right?
-I know, but it would be weird.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.904
I would have to explain why
I have never come around all these years

15:46.987 --> 15:49.281
and all that stuff with Henry.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.077
-It seems like a lot.
-It doesn't have to be.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.621
You're right. My pride is my curse.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.622
Me too.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.917
I seemingly had everything
but really had nothing.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.672
And my sister seemingly had nothing
but had everything.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.051
Huh.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.678
It's too late.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.262
It's not.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.765
You can change your life if you want to.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.936
All this time, I believed in dark forces
that are just my imagination,

16:19.019 --> 16:22.231
and I allowed it to happen,
because even worse than a fake curse

16:22.314 --> 16:25.317
is my reality that my dad is truly sick.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.282
Saying that out loud hurts.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.994
I am so sorry, Glo.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.330
Why do bad things happen to good people?

16:39.665 --> 16:42.292
I ask myself that all the time.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.351
-Poker! When I bring the box, we'll play.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.062
I'll see you soon, okay?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.780
-Let's go! Get in the car!
-I'm going to Mexico now?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.700
No, school! Hurry! You're not expelled.
Lucia got you back in!

17:14.783 --> 17:17.202
The school never checked Tonio's ID
to confirm he was your dad.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.289
They committed all kinds of negligence,
so I threatened to sue.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.749
It's after 4:00. School's over!

17:21.832 --> 17:25.252
But the bent arm hang trials
are about to begin. <i>Dale!</i> Oh, nice dress.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.336
Oh, thanks.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.131
Whoo!

17:29.214 --> 17:32.009
That cleanse gets me every time.
I'm still spinning.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.927
Lay on the couch, baby. Close your eyes.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.346
I'm just so glad I'm not gonna die.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.683
Yeah, it's probably just--
Sorry. It's probably no one.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.810
Or my dad,

17:41.894 --> 17:45.522
unless we make some real money real fast
to get those experimental treatments.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.276
-Have you ever heard of RollerWorld?
-RollerWorld's a myth.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.277
No, it's not.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.613
A kid named Jamal found all that money
in our neighborhood

17:52.696 --> 17:54.782
with his friends
and his buddy's grandma, Marisol.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.949
-Our Marisol?
-Yeah.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.659
They found the money, and she buried it.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.953
They haven't found it yet,
but she left a map.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.957
Maybe if we find Marisol's map,
we can find the money.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.461
Or maybe we should start small
and rob a bank instead.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.056
Hey! What… What a surprise!

18:19.139 --> 18:20.057
Is it?

18:20.891 --> 18:23.685
I know you've been following me,
because I've been following you.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.230
-Why didn't you turn off Find My Friends?
-Why didn't you?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.190
Look. I know what you're doing.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.276
You're obsessing about me and my new man,
and you're regretting your decision.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.571
Now I'm the one that got away,
and you're wondering why.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.824
I'll tell you why.
Because I know you, Cameron.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.743
To you, the hunt is better than the kill.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.828
Mic drop.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.287
Uh, wrong. Wrong.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.873
You don't know me, because I'm
actually happy that you're happy.

18:44.957 --> 18:45.791
You deserve it.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.253
Okay, look, what I'm struggling with
isn't you. It's me.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.047
I don't wanna be not liked. The fact you
don't like me means something.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.340
I hate that you don't like me.

18:53.423 --> 18:57.511
I hate that I hurt you,
and I basically now hate myself too.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.304
How is this my problem?

18:59.388 --> 19:02.057
This feels like a trauma dump,
and I have no room for it.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.977
-What do you want from me?
-I just wanna be your friend.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.896
Then start acting like it.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.612
What started as
the Presidential Physical Fitness Test

19:15.696 --> 19:18.949
has become
a Freeridge High annual competition!

19:19.533 --> 19:22.661
And every year, our best and brightest

19:22.744 --> 19:26.081
try to hang on for as long as they can,

19:26.165 --> 19:29.251
a metaphor for getting through
the tough times in life.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.504
The current record, 8 minutes 20 seconds,

19:32.588 --> 19:36.091
hasn't been broken in almost 30 years!

19:36.175 --> 19:42.097
But today, we have six solid candidates
to best our best time!

19:42.181 --> 19:43.223
Whoo!

19:47.060 --> 19:48.645
Wait!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.481
Damn, Gloria's here?

19:52.858 --> 19:53.942
I'm out.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.944
Whoo!

19:58.322 --> 19:59.823
Let's do this, Coach.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.831
-Come on, Gloria!

20:12.502 --> 20:15.839
-Don't arch your back.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.843
-Hold. Hold.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.262
Hold! Hold! Hold!

20:22.346 --> 20:23.764
Hold! Hold!

20:23.847 --> 20:25.015
Hold! Hold!

20:25.098 --> 20:26.516
Hold! Hold!

20:32.898 --> 20:34.691
Hold! Hold!

20:34.775 --> 20:37.194
She's doing it! She's doing it!

20:37.277 --> 20:38.612
Hold! Hold!

20:38.695 --> 20:41.406
She's done it! Record's broken!

20:42.157 --> 20:44.117
-And she's still holding on!

20:59.091 --> 21:00.676
We'll wait for you in the car.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.386
-I can take her home.
-I'll take--

21:02.469 --> 21:05.264
Me home. You two have fun.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.433
Thank you.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.271
How did you know I was gonna be here?

21:13.438 --> 21:16.275
Tonio. I didn't wanna miss it.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.068
Rusty, I'm sorry.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.654
I let my pride get the best of me
and didn't tell you the truth.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.073
I actually think
we could've been good to--

21:25.617 --> 21:28.078
Wait, what about the other girl?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.080
-Who?
-Ines said--

21:30.163 --> 21:31.623
That there was another girl?

21:33.083 --> 21:33.917
She lied

21:35.002 --> 21:36.420
to both of us.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.673
There is no other girl, Gloria.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.467
Just you.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.859
Hey! I heard.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.236
I can't believe you broke the record
and got back in school!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.989
Oh, and Dad said you and Rusty made up.
I'm so happy--

22:04.072 --> 22:04.948
Stop!

22:06.283 --> 22:08.702
Why? I'm so happy for you.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
Are you?

22:11.246 --> 22:12.873
Because Rusty told me.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.334
Why? Why did you lie to us?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.293
I…

22:17.294 --> 22:18.837
-I don't know why.
-Well, I do.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.507
It's because you're
a jealous, selfish little baby!

22:22.591 --> 22:23.967
I'm not a baby!

22:24.051 --> 22:25.218
Really? Okay.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.721
Well, here's food for thought
that I'm not gonna sugarcoat!

22:27.804 --> 22:31.183
Ines, your actions have consequences,

22:31.266 --> 22:34.686
and you just burned down
the only bridge you had left!

22:35.520 --> 22:37.397
Demi and I found out there's no curse.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.858
So the box isn't cursed,
and neither are we!

22:39.941 --> 22:43.820
I already know that,
but here's something you don't know.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.948
That TikTok, which said something to me
that I've been worrying about for weeks…

22:47.032 --> 22:50.035
All this time, I've been thinking
that I'm gonna be your downfall

22:50.118 --> 22:52.746
when clearly you are mine!

23:52.431 --> 23:53.432
Borrowing.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.016
Wipe it down when you're done.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.799
You didn't hire Rusty
just to be your assistant, did you?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.845
You're paying him
to be Gloria's boyfriend.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.223
Don't tell Gloria.
