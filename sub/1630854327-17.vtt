Remember, I might be dying.

27:03.587 --> 27:05.865
So if you're not,
you could lie.

27:07.764 --> 27:08.937
- I'm single.

27:09.075 --> 27:10.525
- Great.

27:10.663 --> 27:11.664
Now I have something to
live for.

27:11.802 --> 27:13.839
[both chuckle]

27:18.395 --> 27:20.362
- Excuse me.
[all chattering]

27:20.500 --> 27:22.399
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

27:22.537 --> 27:24.090
- It's okay.
You've got good timing.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.229
- Yeah, we were just talking
about you--

27:25.367 --> 27:26.921
- I have made mistakes.

27:27.059 --> 27:28.370
I accept that responsibility.

27:28.508 --> 27:30.545
I accept that
there will be consequences

27:30.683 --> 27:31.788
when I don't do things right.

27:31.926 --> 27:32.927
But right now, it feels like

27:33.065 --> 27:34.238
the biggest mistake
that I have made

27:34.376 --> 27:36.033
is not having enough money
to work here.

27:36.171 --> 27:37.586
I wasn't born with
a silver spoon.

27:37.725 --> 27:40.348
I don't have the family
pedigree to fall back on.

27:40.486 --> 27:41.763
And my student loans are real,

27:41.901 --> 27:43.420
and the risk of my parents
losing their home

27:43.558 --> 27:46.423
if I can't make
my loan payment is also real.

27:46.561 --> 27:48.632
And--and what? The promise of
an attending's salary

27:48.770 --> 27:49.806
ten years down the line?

27:49.944 --> 27:52.360
That doesn't do anything
for me right now.

27:52.498 --> 27:54.569
I think you all know that
I bust my ass for this program.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.640
And I will continue to
devote myself to

27:56.778 --> 27:58.573
becoming an excellent surgeon.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.956
But that devotion has to
include working a second job.

28:02.094 --> 28:04.475
- Well, actually, it doesn't.

28:04.613 --> 28:05.925
- I quit.

28:06.063 --> 28:07.927
Can't fire me 'cause I quit.

28:08.065 --> 28:09.791
[quirky music]

28:09.929 --> 28:12.414
- You're not getting fired.

28:12.552 --> 28:14.209
You're getting a grant.

28:14.347 --> 28:16.591
- We are starting
an emergency relief fund

28:16.729 --> 28:18.248
for any resident
that might need it.

28:18.386 --> 28:19.836
It's not gonna pay off
all your loans,

28:19.974 --> 28:21.803
but it will help
make ends meet.

28:21.941 --> 28:25.289
And we would like for you
to be the first recipient.

28:25.427 --> 28:28.016
- Unless you've quit.

28:28.154 --> 28:29.293
- No.

28:29.431 --> 28:30.467
No, I don't quit.

28:30.605 --> 28:33.090
I rescind my quitting.

28:33.228 --> 28:34.367
Thank you.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.992

how much that means to me.
