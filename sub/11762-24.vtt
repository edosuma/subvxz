WEBVTT

00:01.472 --> 00:04.105
(lowered voice) THIS IS HOW
I WANT TO LET LAURIE AND TRAVIS

00:04.105 --> 00:05.636
KNOW THAT WE'RE DATING.

00:05.636 --> 00:09.080
I WANT THEM TO DISCOVER US
IN THE PERFECT COUPLE MOMENT.
SUPER.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.412
OKAY, NOW COME OVER HERE.
YEP.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.215
YEAH, THE LIGHT'S BETTER
RIGHT THERE. NOW KISS ME.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.347
WELL, NO, NOT LIKE THAT.

00:16.347 --> 00:20.020
YOU'RE NOT GOING OFF TO WAR.
JUST A-A SWEET, GENTLE PECK.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.553
MM. OKAY, WAIT. WAIT.
(speaks inaudibly)

00:22.553 --> 00:25.256
I'VE, UH, I'VE NEVER HATED
ANYTHING THIS MUCH.

00:25.256 --> 00:27.528
WE GOTTA GET
THEIR ATTENTION. COUGH.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.560
(coughs)

00:29.560 --> 00:32.403
(door opens and closes)
NOT IN MY FACE, DUDE.
TURN YOUR HEAD AND COUGH.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.405
OOH, ELLIE AND I PLAY
THAT GAME.

00:34.405 --> 00:37.238
SHE WEARS A SURGICAL MASK
AND NOTHING ELSE.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.470
ANDY, BOUNDARIES.

00:39.470 --> 00:43.444
HAVE YOU TOLD THESE GUYS
YOU TWO ARE HOOKING UP YET?

00:43.444 --> 00:45.346
GREAT. NOW YOU LOOK.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.078
(whispers) COME ON.

00:47.078 --> 00:50.421
(normal voice) I KNOW
THIS IS HUGE, SO LET'S HEAR IT.

00:50.421 --> 00:53.684
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE ALREADY DATING.
WELL, SMITH, IN A FEW MINUTES,

00:53.684 --> 00:56.087
I'M GIVING OUT
THE "WHO INVITED YOU?" AWARD,

00:56.087 --> 00:59.760
AND YOU OUGHTA GET
YOUR SPEECH READY.
SORRY, JULES, BUT YOU'RE NOT
IN A RELATIONSHIP YET.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.593
IT HAS TO LAST AT LEAST NINE
DAYS BEFORE I CONSIDER IT REAL.

01:02.593 --> 01:04.565
IT'S THE SAME RULE THAT I HAVE

01:04.565 --> 01:07.568
FOR HAIR EXTENSIONS
OR FOSTER PARENTS.
YOUR RULES ARE--

01:07.568 --> 01:09.800
AH, SWEETIE.
THIS IS JULES' TIME.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.802
BUT I HAVE TO LET IT OUT.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.804
WHISPER WHAT YOU WERE
GONNA SAY.

01:13.804 --> 01:15.606
(whispering indistinctly)

01:15.606 --> 01:17.378
REALLY?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.850
TRAV, ME AND GRAYSON--
THOUGHTS? FEELINGS?

01:19.850 --> 01:22.513
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

01:22.513 --> 01:24.315
HEY, NEW DAD,
YOU GIVE ME 20 BUCKS,

01:24.315 --> 01:26.617
I'LL NEVER CALL YOU
"NEW DAD" AGAIN.

01:26.617 --> 01:28.589
WINNER.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.591
THANK YOU. SEE YOU, MOM.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.124
I LOVE YOU, NEW DAD.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.126
THAT FEELS RIGHT.

01:35.126 --> 01:38.599
THAT IS THE LONGEST, MEANEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
NO, I'M NOT DONE YET.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.831
OH.
(whispering indistinctly)

01:40.831 --> 01:43.274
COME ON.

01:43.274 --> 01:46.577
IT'D BE MORE ROMANTIC IF YOU RAN
YOUR FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR.

01:46.577 --> 01:48.809
YEAH, IT WOULD BE.

01:48.809 --> 01:53.113
SHE'S NOT GOING FOR IT,
BUDDY.
I WONDER WHY, DAD.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.114
WHAT?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.116
TODAY'S SPECIAL FOR US.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.490
IT IS?
IT'S OUR 7-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

01:59.490 --> 02:01.822
(laughs) YOU SCREWED
THE POOCH, TRAV-Y.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.295
SEVEN MONTHS IS A BIG ONE.

02:04.295 --> 02:07.298
IS IT, DAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST TALKING.

02:07.298 --> 02:10.531
HEY, IS THERE ANY MORE
OF THAT FANCY SALAMI LEFT?
I JUST ATE THE LAST PIECE.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.863
OH, MAN. I WISH
I COULD BE YOUR MOUTH.

02:12.863 --> 02:15.866
DAD, MNH-MNH,
MNH-MNH, MNH-MNH.

02:15.866 --> 02:17.868
LOOK, YOUR HOUSE IS GREAT,

02:17.868 --> 02:20.511
BUT DO YOU EVER THINK
WE COULD SLEEP OVER HERE?

02:20.511 --> 02:22.743
NO.
WHEN I'M IN YOUR BEDROOM,

02:22.743 --> 02:25.916
I FEEL LIKE BALLOONS ARE GONNA
START FALLING FROM THE CEILING,

02:25.916 --> 02:29.450
LIKE I'M
THE "MILLIONTH CUSTOMER." EEE.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.852
(laughs) THAT'S FUNNY.
I SHOULD RIG THAT UP.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.455
NO, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T.
JULES, IN A RELATIONSHIP--

02:34.455 --> 02:36.156
OH, W-W-W-W-WAIT.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
IF YOU'RE GONNA START
PONTIFICATING

02:38.158 --> 02:39.460
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.892
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RECORD THIS
ON MY PHONE.

02:41.892 --> 02:43.864
(phone beeping)
'CAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU,

02:43.864 --> 02:46.166
THIS WILL COME BACK
TO BITE YOU ON THE ASS.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.938
I AIN'T SCURRED.
MM-HMM.

02:47.938 --> 02:50.671
JULES, IN A RELATIONSHIP,

02:50.671 --> 02:53.674
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO
THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
IT'S PART OF BEING A COUPLE.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.210
(laughs) THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
OKAY.
(beep)

02:59.210 --> 03:02.283
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
NO ONE CARED THAT WE'RE DATING.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.255
WHAT?

03:04.255 --> 03:06.887
DID YOU TELL... EVERYONE?

03:06.887 --> 03:08.859
(gasps) BOBBY.

03:08.859 --> 03:11.292
BOBBY!

03:11.292 --> 03:12.423
BOBBY.

03:12.423 --> 03:14.194
BOB-BY.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.526
BOBBY?

03:15.526 --> 03:17.298
DAD.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.829
BOBBY!

03:18.829 --> 03:20.831
BOBBY!

03:20.831 --> 03:22.633
BOBBY!

03:22.633 --> 03:24.375
WHAT'S UP?

03:24.375 --> 03:27.778
NOTHING. SOMETIMES I JUST LIKE
TO SAY YOUR NAME OUT LOUD.

03:27.778 --> 03:29.240
ME, TOO.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.982
BUT I WHISPER IT.
(whispers) BOBBY.

03:31.982 --> 03:35.486
WE ALL JUST FORGOT TO TELL HIM.
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.788
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR FAULT.
LET ME HAVE THIS, TRAV.

03:37.788 --> 03:40.791
I LET YOU HAVE "GIRLS DIG
GUYS WITH SKINNY ARMS."

03:40.791 --> 03:44.224
THAT'S PRIVATE.
THIS IS GONNA CRUSH BOBBY. HE
STILL CARRIES A TORCH FOR YOU.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.828
PLUS, GRAYSON IS
HIS SECOND BEST FRIEND.
WHO'S HIS FIRST BEST?

03:47.828 --> 03:51.862
I WILL FIGHT YOU RIGHT HERE.
WHY DOES OUR BABY
KEEP SAYING "BOBBY"?

03:51.862 --> 03:55.366
(both chanting) BOBBY. BOBBY.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.908
BOBBY. BOBBY.

03:57.908 --> 04:00.771
WHO KNOWS WHY BABIES DO THINGS?

04:00.771 --> 04:02.943
OKAY, SO WHO DO WE THINK
SHOULD TELL HIM?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.775
(all) YOU.
YOU, FOR SURE.

04:04.775 --> 04:06.817
I DON'T WANT
TO BREAK HIS HEART AGAIN.

04:06.817 --> 04:09.720
MAYBE ANDY SHOULD TELL HIM.
YOU ARE HIS BEST FRIEND.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.484
(high-pitched voice)
THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH.
OR GRAYSON. 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT ONLY HIS FRIEND,

04:13.484 --> 04:16.327
BUT YOU'RE ALSO THE ONE DOING
FILTHY THINGS TO HIS EX.

04:16.327 --> 04:18.359
STILL HERE, JUST IN CASE
YOU WERE WONDERING.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.832
SO SKINNY.
THEY'RE LIKE POOL CUES.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.934
YEAH.
AW!

04:23.934 --> 04:26.967
OKAY, WE KNOW IT'S GOTTA BE ONE
OF THE THREE OF US, SO I THINK

04:26.967 --> 04:29.400
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT WE CAN DO TO SOLVE THIS.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.303
ULTIMATE PENNY CAN.
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS--

04:32.303 --> 04:34.445
ELLIE IS GONNA ASK A QUESTION
ABOUT BOBBY.

04:34.445 --> 04:36.877
YOU GET IT RIGHT,
YOU MOVE A STEP CLOSER.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.280
LAST PLAYER LEFT
HAS TO DROP THE BOMB ON BOBBY.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.612
LET'S BEGIN.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.884
GRAYSON, WHAT'S BEEN BOBBY'S
FAVORITE BEACH ACTIVITY

04:43.884 --> 04:45.456
SINCE HE WAS 4?

04:45.456 --> 04:47.618
I JUST MET HIM, LIKE,
SIX MONTHS AGO--

04:47.618 --> 04:49.019
INCORRECT. JULES?

04:49.019 --> 04:50.861
HE LOVES TO FEED THE SEAGULLS
AT THE BEACH

04:50.861 --> 04:52.863
BECAUSE IT MAKES HIM
FEEL LIKE A BIRD GOD.

04:52.863 --> 04:54.895
WRONG! HE USED TO LOVE
TO DO THAT

04:54.895 --> 04:57.898
UNTIL HE TRIED TO SHARE
A HOT DOG WITH ONE,

04:57.898 --> 05:00.901
AND IT ATE THE WHOLE THING.
VERY SELFISH.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.375
HIS NEW FAVORITE BEACH ACTIVITY
IS BEING BURIED IN THE SAND

05:04.375 --> 05:08.008
'CAUSE HE LIKES TO IMAGINE
HIMSELF BEING JUST A HEAD.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.881
CORRECT.
AH, THANK YOU.

05:10.881 --> 05:13.013
THIS COULD BE TROUBLE FOR US.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.015
A CHEETO SHAPED LIKE
BRUCE WILLIS.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.848
FRANCIS BACON,
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.

05:17.848 --> 05:19.520
BOZ SCAGGS.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.921
UNCIRCUMCISED.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.022
J.C.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.724
THE HISPANIC MECHANIC.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.925
TOLSTOY.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.797
(clink)

05:26.797 --> 05:28.799
(high-pitched voice) PENNY CAN!

05:28.799 --> 05:31.602
(normal voice)
BOOM! BEST FRIEND OUT.

05:31.602 --> 05:33.434
DAMN IT!

05:33.434 --> 05:35.005
(exhales deeply)

05:35.005 --> 05:38.038
OH, SWEETIE.
I GOTTA GO MEET KYLIE.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.941
CAN YOU BELIEVE ALL
THIS ATTITUDE SHE'S GIVING ME

05:40.941 --> 05:42.943
ABOUT FORGETTING
A 7-MONTH ANNIVERSARY?

05:42.943 --> 05:46.747
IT DEPENDS. HAS SHE EVER LET YOU
SEE HER COMPLETELY NAKED?

05:46.747 --> 05:49.980
FOR, LIKE, EIGHT SECONDS.
WE WERE CHANGING TO GO SWIMMING.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.484
(high-pitched voice) WHAT UP?
THEN JUST GO TAKE YOUR LUMPS
AND MOVE ON.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.686
OR I COULD TELL HER
HOW RIDICULOUS SHE'S BEING.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.689
TRAV, I KNOW THAT KYLIE IS
A SWEET, INNOCENT LITTLE FLOWER,

05:58.689 --> 06:00.761
BUT IF YOU GO AT HER,

06:00.761 --> 06:03.764
SHE WILL TAKE OFF THAT SWEET,
LITTLE MASK, AND YOU WILL SEE...

06:03.764 --> 06:05.896
(hisses)

06:05.896 --> 06:08.138
DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

06:08.138 --> 06:10.671
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
SHOW YOU THE MOUTH. READY?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.973
(hisses)

06:12.973 --> 06:17.548
HOW DID BOBBY'S UNCLE RICKY
LOSE HIS NOSE?

06:17.548 --> 06:19.079
DYNAMITE FISHING.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.110
CORRECT!

06:20.110 --> 06:22.913
YES!

06:22.913 --> 06:26.657
THE FACT THAT I AM STILL
STANDING BACK HERE SHOULD PROVE

06:26.657 --> 06:29.159
THAT I'M NOT THE RIGHT PERSON
TO TELL BOBBY ABOUT ANYTHING!

06:29.159 --> 06:31.021
WHINY BABY, SAY "WHAT?"

06:31.021 --> 06:32.022
WHAT?

06:32.022 --> 06:35.796
GAME OVER, SUCKA!

06:35.796 --> 06:40.130
(clanking)

06:40.130 --> 06:42.002
DAGNABBIT!

06:42.002 --> 06:44.905
ABOUT WHAT "STAR WARS" CHARACTER
HAS BOBBY ALWAYS SAID,

06:44.905 --> 06:47.908
"IF YOU THROW A SKIRT ON ONE
OF THOSE FURRY LITTLE THINGS,

06:47.908 --> 06:50.110
I WOULD TOTALLY HIT THAT"?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.142
AH, THE HELL WITH THIS.

06:52.142 --> 06:55.946
(whooshing)

06:55.946 --> 06:57.918
(clink)

06:57.918 --> 07:02.022
OH HO HO! PENNY CAN!
(laughs)

07:02.022 --> 07:04.424
NO! I KNEW THAT ONE!

07:04.424 --> 07:05.896
AN EWOK!

07:05.896 --> 07:09.700
HE WANTS TO MAKE LOVE
TO AN EWOK!

07:09.700 --> 07:15.706
в™Єв™Є

07:23.774 --> 07:24.875
SURPRISE.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.678
HEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE AT MY PLACE.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.680
HOW MUCH SNOOPING
HAVE YOU DONE?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.982
YOUR HIPSTER WOOL HAT
COLLECTION?

07:31.982 --> 07:33.123
REALLY?

07:33.123 --> 07:35.786
WE'RE IN FLORIDA.
DON'T BE THAT GUY.

07:35.786 --> 07:38.859
SOMETIMES THEY LOOK COOL.
ON PLANET DOUCHE-ALON.

07:38.859 --> 07:43.063
LOVELY. OKAY, SO HOW DID
YOUR, UH, TALK WITH BOBBY GO?

07:43.063 --> 07:45.936
OH, SO GREAT,
EXCEPT THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

07:45.936 --> 07:48.569
YOU SEE, I WAS HOPING
THAT MAYBE TOMORROW

07:48.569 --> 07:51.802
WE COULD DO IT TOGETHER.
NO WAY IN HELL.

07:51.802 --> 07:54.474
(turns on stereo)
(Grayson) JULES,
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.908
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

07:57.908 --> 08:01.181
IT'S PART OF BEING A COUPLE.
THAT'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.914
(door opens and closes)
YOU'RE SO IN.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.887
LOOK AT ME. I'M GRAYSON.
(sniffs)

08:06.887 --> 08:08.889
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.891
ELLIE USED TO BE A DEEJAY,

08:10.891 --> 08:15.596
AND, UH, SHE HAPPENED TO
GIVE YOU A LITTLE REMIX HERE.
(clicks button)

08:15.596 --> 08:17.928
(techno music playing)
в™Є JULES, SOMETIMES
IN A RELATIONSHIP... в™Є

08:17.928 --> 08:19.970
JULES, IN-YOUR-FACE DANCE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE.

08:19.970 --> 08:23.503
IT'S JUST THE RUNNING MAN.
COME ON.
в™Є BEING A COUPLE,
BEING A COUPLE в™Є

08:23.503 --> 08:25.676
в™Є BEING A--BEING A--
BEING A--BEING A-- в™Є

08:25.676 --> 08:28.679
в™Є BEING A COUPLE в™Є
OKAY, GRAYSON,
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

08:28.679 --> 08:32.042
GO GET YOUR P.J.s.
WE'RE GOING TO MY HOUSE.
STUPID RELATIONSHIP.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.944
в™Є YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO в™Є

08:33.944 --> 08:36.246

08:38.989 --> 08:41.992
в™Є YOU DON'T WANT TO DO, DO, DO,

08:41.992 --> 08:44.625
HERE'S YOUR BEER, BUDDY.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.057
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY SUCKED
ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH TRAVIS?

08:47.057 --> 08:48.659
HE WAS WITH KYLIE,

08:48.659 --> 08:51.562
AND I COULD REALLY SENSE
THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THERE.

08:51.562 --> 08:54.565
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A RADAR
FOR STUFF LIKE THAT.
DO YOU NOW?

08:54.565 --> 08:56.867
YEAH.
YOU WANT A TUG OF MY BEER?

08:56.867 --> 08:59.870
WHY NOT?
PUT IT IN MY HAND.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.572
(Stan) Bob-by.

09:01.572 --> 09:04.214
NO WAY! IT WORKED.
(mouths words)

09:04.214 --> 09:05.976
WHAT WORKED?

09:05.976 --> 09:07.918
ANDY?

09:07.918 --> 09:10.150
(mouths words)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.252
YOU WANT A CAPPUCCINO?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.024
YOU'RE A JERK.

09:14.024 --> 09:18.058
HOW ABOUT A FRAPPUCCINO?
LOOK, YOU CANNOT STILL BE MAD.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.960
A 7-MONTH ANNIVERSARY?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.092
(high-pitched voice)
IT'S A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.764
(heavy metal music playing)

09:23.764 --> 09:27.868
в™Єв™Є

09:30.340 --> 09:34.675
(shouting inaudibly)

09:34.675 --> 09:37.708
YOU SKINNY-ARMED LITTLE BITCH!

09:37.708 --> 09:41.011
YOU SAW HER DEVIL FACE,
HUH?

09:41.011 --> 09:43.013
I CAN STILL SEE IT.

09:43.013 --> 09:45.015
TRAV, YOU'RE NOT DATING GIRLS
ANYMORE.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.317
YOU'RE DATING WOMEN,
AND WHEN A WOMAN IS MAD,

09:47.317 --> 09:50.190
YOU NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE.

09:50.190 --> 09:54.795
WELL, WHAT DOES SMITH DO?
IF I'M TOTALLY RAGING,
HE JUST STARTS NODDING A LOT

09:54.795 --> 09:58.028
AND THROWS MONEY AROUND.
FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER BEEN JEALOUS OF YOU.

09:58.028 --> 09:59.930
THANKS, ELLIE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.032
NICE MOMENT OVER?
SO OVER.

10:02.032 --> 10:04.104
GOOD. IT FELT WRONG.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.677
TRAVIS, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF DEFENSIVE STYLES OUT THERE.

10:06.677 --> 10:09.680
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THE ONE
THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.882
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'D BE A GOOD CRIER.
(door opens and closes)

10:11.882 --> 10:16.086
I'M NOT, BUT I'M GLAD
I GIVE OFF THAT VIBE. COOL.
HEY, BABE.

10:16.086 --> 10:18.849
DON'T TALK TO ME.
I AM RAGING!

10:18.849 --> 10:20.620
DO YOU WANNA GO SHOPPING?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.223
I GUESS SO.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.957
(mouths word)
(whispers) OKAY, EVERYBODY,
EVERYBODY, HE'S COMING!

10:26.957 --> 10:29.629
COME ON. ANDY!
GET OUT OF THE POOL!

10:29.629 --> 10:32.803
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S HAPPENING! HERE.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.905
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.907
(normal voice) FO' SHIZZLE,
FO' SHIZZLE, FO' SHIZZLE.
WORD!

10:36.907 --> 10:38.238
HEY, PLAYER.
NAMASTE, DUDE.
WHAT'S UP?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.370
I DON'T WANT
TO DATE YOU ANYMORE.

10:40.370 --> 10:43.013
YEAH, YOU DO, DAWG.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.015
(laughs) I'M PSYCHED
Y'ALL DROPPED BY.

10:45.015 --> 10:46.947
I'LL GO GRAB US SOME BEERS.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.020
OOH! BUT THE FRIDGE IS BROKE,
SO I'LL PUT 'EM ON ICE.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.923
IF THE REFRIGERATOR'S BROKEN,
THEN WHERE'S HE GONNA GET--

10:52.923 --> 10:55.726
(laughs) I DON'T HAVE ICE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT 'EM
IN THE TOILET TANK

10:55.726 --> 10:58.328
FOR A FEW MINUTES?
THAT'LL COOL 'EM DOWN.
(imitates shooting sounds)

10:58.328 --> 11:01.431
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S THE PLAN.
WHY DO WE NEED A PLAN?

11:01.431 --> 11:03.033
BECAUSE BOBBY IS A RUNNER.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.435
ANY TIME HE GETS NEWS THAT
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH,

11:05.435 --> 11:07.097
HE BOLTS.
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM

11:07.097 --> 11:09.139
WHEN I TRIED TO GIVE HIM
OUR DIVORCE PAPERS.

11:09.139 --> 11:12.973
(motor rumbling)

11:12.973 --> 11:16.977
(mouth full)
BOBBY, IT'S FOR THE BEST!

11:19.109 --> 11:22.352
WHERE'D YOU GET AN A.T.V.?
FROM A LIFEGUARD. DER!

11:22.352 --> 11:25.115
HE JUST... (laughs)
LET YOU BORROW IT?

11:25.115 --> 11:28.188
WHAT ARE YOU, A DETECTIVE?
HAND ME THOSE SHOES.

11:30.060 --> 11:33.023
(clatters)
AAH!

11:33.023 --> 11:35.796
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.
HE AIN'T RUNNING NOWHERE.
IT'S A GREAT PLAN.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.969
RIGHT?
(laughs)
I DON'T HAVE A TOILET.

11:38.969 --> 11:40.470
(laughs)
WARM BEER.

11:40.470 --> 11:41.972
OOH.

11:41.972 --> 11:45.135
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU TAUGHT STAN
HOW TO SAY "BOBBY."

11:45.135 --> 11:48.708
I HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE MOVIES
YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO SEE,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.981
AND EVERY TIME
STAN SAYS THE NAME "BOBBY,"

11:50.981 --> 11:53.343
I'M GONNA RUIN THE ENDING
FOR YOU.

11:53.343 --> 11:56.046
(lowered voice)
THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU TO SEE.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.948
ANDY IS
A FANTASTIC DEFENSIVE PLAYER.

11:57.948 --> 11:59.820
(sighs)
HE'S SLEEPIN'.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.022
NO, HE'S JUST PRETENDING.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.194
WATCH.

12:04.194 --> 12:06.927
ANDY, COME ON. TALK TO US.
(chuckles)

12:06.927 --> 12:11.101
DOES ELLIE STILL LOOK MAD?
AT THE END OF "TEEN WOLF,"
HE WINS THE BIG GAME

12:11.101 --> 12:13.764
WITHOUT HAVING
TO TURN INTO A TEEN WOLF.

12:13.764 --> 12:16.236
DAMN IT, WOMAN. I WAITED
25 YEARS TO SEE THAT!

12:16.236 --> 12:18.068
WHY?

12:20.310 --> 12:23.213
LOOK, BOBBY, THE REASON
WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE...

12:23.213 --> 12:25.215
WE REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

12:25.215 --> 12:28.218
OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD
I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT RIGHT NOW.

12:28.218 --> 12:30.220
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

12:30.220 --> 12:32.222
(Bobby) LOOK AT THOSE TWO.

12:32.222 --> 12:35.525
(Jules) IT'S SO CUTE.
IT'S BULL CRAP
IS WHAT IT IS.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.188
I'M A THIRD WHEEL
TO MY OWN DOG.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.190
I'M A THIRD WHEEL
WITH TRAVIS AND KYLIE.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.192
I'M A THIRD WHEEL
TO ELLIE AND ANDY.

12:42.192 --> 12:44.194
HELL, EVEN LAURIE'S GOT
A BOYFRIEND.

12:44.194 --> 12:47.497
UH, UM, BOBBY,
GRAYSON AND I, UH...

12:47.497 --> 12:49.499
YOU WANNA JUMP IN THERE?

12:49.499 --> 12:52.002
HUH? NO. MNH-MNH.
YOU'RE CRUSHING IT.
(laughs)

12:52.002 --> 12:54.905
GUYS, WE'RE
THE LAST THREE STANDING.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.047
NOW I HATE TO BE
DADDY DOWNER,

12:57.047 --> 13:00.080
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
IF I WAS THE ONLY ONE SINGLE,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.782
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO. (sighs)

13:04.254 --> 13:07.317
ME, NEITHER. (laughs)
TO US, THE SINGLE FOLK.

13:07.317 --> 13:10.360
(clink)
WHOO!

13:16.897 --> 13:19.169
I COULDN'T TELL BOBBY.
IT WOULD'VE DESTROYED HIM.

13:19.169 --> 13:21.101
OH, THIS SUCKS.

13:22.232 --> 13:25.936
WHAT?
SEX HAS TO EQUAL FREE WINE.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.238
WHY DON'T YOU JUST,
UH, STEAL MY TIPS, TOO?

13:28.238 --> 13:31.811
OH, GREAT. YEAH. I'M GOING
OUT FOR ICE CREAM LATER.
(mouths words)

13:31.811 --> 13:35.085
ALL RIGHT. WE GOTTA COME UP
WITH A NEW PLAN.
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND PLANS?

13:35.085 --> 13:37.217
EVERYTHING WORKS BETTER
WHEN YOU HAVE A PLAN--

13:37.217 --> 13:41.121
BIRTHDAYS, VACATIONS, MURDERS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID MURDERS.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.124
IT'S NOT LIKE I DAYDREAM ABOUT
TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH ONE.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.856
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

13:45.856 --> 13:48.298
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL HIM? HMM?

13:48.298 --> 13:51.461
WHY DOES EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE SO DIFFICULT WITH YOU?
(electric guitar plays
discordant note)

13:51.461 --> 13:54.865
THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING
TO SAY.
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.867
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE
GRAYSON'S DEFENSE MECHANISM.

13:56.867 --> 14:00.570
WHEN A WOMAN REALLY GOES AT HIM,
HE JUST SHUTS DOWN LIKE A ROBOT.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.072
AREN'T YOU BOBBY'S FRIEND?

14:02.072 --> 14:03.914
DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS?

14:03.914 --> 14:05.916
AND SHUT DOWN.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.217
(Laurie makes whirring sound)

14:07.217 --> 14:10.020
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK
TO ME NOW? HELLO?

14:10.020 --> 14:12.883
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GET
TO STAY AT YOUR PLACE TONIGHT.

14:12.883 --> 14:14.324
ENJOY IT.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.426
AND REBOOT.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.528
(Laurie makes whirring sound)

14:18.528 --> 14:21.031
HOLY CRAP. MY MOM'S
DATING THE TERMINATOR.

14:21.031 --> 14:24.634
YOU KNOW WHY I'D RATHER PLAY
FETCH WITH YOU THAN MY DOG?

14:24.634 --> 14:27.067
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER
BRING THE BALL BACK

14:27.067 --> 14:29.069
TO YOUR
TINY, LITTLE DOG GIRLFRIEND.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.071
YOU'D BRING IT TO ME.
BROS BEFORE HOS, MAN.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.644
(clink)
THIS IS NOT
WHERE WE HANG OUT NOW.

14:34.644 --> 14:38.048
HEY, LADIES.
GRAY MATTER!
GET INVOLVED, BABY.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.479
FINE. BEER ME.

14:39.479 --> 14:43.113
THERE YOU GO. I'M SORRY FOR
STILL THIRD-WHEELIN' IT, ELLIE.

14:43.113 --> 14:46.116
I JUST MISS THE DAYS OF US JUST
BEING FRIENDS HANGING OUT.

14:46.116 --> 14:49.119
BUT NOW EVERYONE'S ALL COUPLED
UP, RAISING KIDS AND WHATNOT.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.321
JUST SEEMS LIKE
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

14:51.321 --> 14:54.424
TO BE PALS ANYMORE,
YOU KNOW?
I DO.

14:54.424 --> 14:56.166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:56.166 --> 14:57.897
NO, JULES, LISTEN.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.669
IT'S NOT HAPPENING
TONIGHT, GRAYSON.

14:59.669 --> 15:03.073
SO YOU WANNA TAKE A QUICK GANDER
AT WHAT YOU'RE MISSING?

15:03.073 --> 15:04.574
BAM! FRESHLY MOISTURIZED.

15:04.574 --> 15:07.607
MM. YEP. MUST HURT
JUST A LITTLE BIT, HMM?

15:07.607 --> 15:11.311
I HAVE A PLAN.
SHUT UP! YOU HAVE A PLAN?

15:11.311 --> 15:14.914
I KNOW. FIRST TIME EVER.
NOW FLASH ME AGAIN.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.988
NO, NO. TELL ME THE PLAN.
OH, FINE.

15:17.988 --> 15:19.219
(babbles)

15:19.219 --> 15:20.951
OKAY. TELL ME EVERYTHING!

15:20.951 --> 15:22.252
ABOUT WHAT?

15:22.252 --> 15:25.125
OKAY,
GRAYSON AND I HAVE AN IDEA.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.627
TONIGHT WE'RE ALL GONNA
GO TO THE BEACH.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.399
WE'RE GONNA DRINK WINE

15:29.399 --> 15:32.162
AND BUILD A BONFIRE
JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

15:32.162 --> 15:35.165
AND HERE'S THE CATCH--WE'RE
ALL GONNA GO JUST AS FRIENDS.

15:35.165 --> 15:37.667
NO COUPLES ALLOWED. COUPLES
CAN'T EVEN RIDE THERE TOGETHER.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.440
(laughs) HELL, YEAH, JULES.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.943
SINGLES' PARTY AT THE BEACH,
HUH? BARB LIKE-Y.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.245
FROLICKING IN THE WAVES,

15:45.245 --> 15:46.946
YOUR PRIVATES
GETTING SANDBLASTED

15:46.946 --> 15:49.619
SO THEY SHINE
LIKE A BOWLING TROPHY.
YOU DONE?

15:49.619 --> 15:51.121
NOT YET.

15:51.121 --> 15:54.224
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS CARRY
MY SWIMSUIT.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.457
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN COVER?
IT LOOKS LIKE A NET.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.459
IT CATCHES
ALL THE LITTLE FISHIES.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.561
BYE, LITTLE FISH.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.734
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH?

16:04.734 --> 16:07.998
HE STILL HASN'T PICKED
A DEFENSIVE STYLE.
HE'D BETTER DO IT SOON,

16:07.998 --> 16:12.072
OR HE SHOULD STRAP IT ON FOR
A LIFETIME OF THIS. (snarls)
(snarls)

16:12.072 --> 16:14.404
YEAH, WELL, THANKS AGAIN
FOR COMING OVER.

16:14.404 --> 16:18.108
UH, LOOK, I DON'T REALLY LIKE
PLAYING GAMES IN RELATIONSHIPS,

16:18.108 --> 16:21.011
SO MAYBE I DON'T NEED
A "STYLE."

16:21.011 --> 16:23.353
WOMEN ARE GONNA EAT YOU
ALIVE.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

16:23.353 --> 16:26.356
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO TEACH YOU.
I KNOW YOU WERE.

16:26.356 --> 16:28.358
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:28.358 --> 16:31.361
ARE YOU JUST CONSTANTLY
AGREEING TO SHUT US UP?

16:31.361 --> 16:32.562
YEAH.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.064
DO YOU LIKE IT?

16:34.064 --> 16:35.995
IT'S BRILLIANT!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.367
YOU'RE THE "YES" MAN.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.069
(laughs) YES!

16:39.069 --> 16:40.400
YES, I AM.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.173
IT'S BEACH TIME!
TRAV, GO JOIN THE GUYS.

16:43.173 --> 16:44.474
LADIES, LET'S RIDE.

16:44.474 --> 16:47.207

OHH. (laughs)

19:08.318 --> 19:10.880
LOOK, HE'S HAPPY,
PLUS HE'S BURIED IN THE SAND,

19:10.880 --> 19:14.354
SO HE CAN'T RUN AWAY
WHEN WE TALK TO HIM.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.726
IT REALLY WAS
THE PERFECT PLAN.

19:16.726 --> 19:18.758
THANK YOU.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.360
WHAT THE HELL?!

19:23.693 --> 19:25.595
THAT WASN'T SMART. (sighs)

19:25.595 --> 19:27.897
(Andy) WE'LL GIVE YOU GUYS
A FEW MINUTES.

19:27.897 --> 19:31.471
HE'S JUST LONELY, YOU KNOW?
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.172
I HOPE SO, TOO.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.174
OKAY, BOBBY,
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.846
I'M NOT TRYING
TO RUN AWAY.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.848
I'M TRYING TO BURROW DEEPER.

19:38.848 --> 19:42.212
HOW THE HELL
CAN YOU GUYS DO THIS?

19:42.212 --> 19:45.455
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT YOU ON PURPOSE.
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

19:45.455 --> 19:48.788
THE WORST PART IS KNOWING
THAT EVERYONE'S LAUGHING AT ME.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.660
BOBBY COBB, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.922
NO ONE IS LAUGHING AT YOU.

19:52.922 --> 19:55.865
HELL, WE ALL LOVE YOU
SO MUCH THAT WE'RE HERE

19:55.865 --> 19:58.768
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET YOU THROUGH THIS.

19:58.768 --> 20:00.770
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE AT THE BEACH TONIGHT.

20:00.770 --> 20:03.433
'CAUSE WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO SHOW YOU

20:03.433 --> 20:05.975

FROM BEING FRIENDS.

20:05.975 --> 20:07.937
SO YOU DID ALL THIS
FOR ME?

20:07.937 --> 20:10.340
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

20:18.248 --> 20:20.750
YOU PROMISE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM?

20:20.750 --> 20:25.395
WHY DON'T YOU LET US
TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A WHILE?

20:25.395 --> 20:27.957
WANT ME TO DIG YOU OUT OF THERE?

20:27.957 --> 20:30.460
