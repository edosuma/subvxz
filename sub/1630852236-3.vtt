RuPaul gave me
inspiration as a drag queen.

voice that I could identify

03:44.090 --> 03:45.391
and hear myself in.

good at storytelling

We have some amazing
vocalists in this competition

22:07.626 --> 22:10.395
and I feel like although
your vocal is not as strong

22:10.462 --> 22:12.764
as some of those,
you have a niche.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.466
You just looked
like you were having fun

22:14.533 --> 22:17.135

22:22.974 --> 22:25.177
The issue for me,
Matante, is that though

22:25.243 --> 22:27.412
that song was done well,
your pitch was fine,

22:27.479 --> 22:29.681
it was kind of simple.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.316
I knew coming
into this competition

22:31.383 --> 22:34.386
that I wasn't going to
have like a Beyonce, Mariah,

22:34.453 --> 22:36.321
Celine type of voice.
I want to be Katy Perry.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.723
I want to be a pop girl.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.391
I don't want to be a queen diva.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.693
You don't have to be.
But we still have

22:41.760 --> 22:44.062
to think about song choices
when we are comparing vocals.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.397

it comes down to.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.732

something and then it was over.

For this performance,

the theme is Turn Back Time.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.627
And I'm paying

I want to give her a tribute

being a badass

24:15.854 --> 24:17.989
Indian brides are supposed
to have really long hair

24:18.056 --> 24:20.458
so when she was married,
she had really long hair.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.460
Then she told my father that,
“I'm cutting it off

you live your fantasy

accept me in my country,

have a second chance,

39:45.116 --> 39:46.350
