00:15.510 --> 00:18.280
It's that crazy Ranger.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.280
I told you what he done

00:19.280 --> 00:21.280
up at the Wrecking Bar
last Saturday?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.750
You sure that's him?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.050
THUG:
Yeah.

( rock music continues )

00:45.780 --> 00:47.140
( indistinct chattering )

00:56.020 --> 00:57.150
I'm looking for Snake Larkin.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.090
Well, well, Curly.

01:03.090 --> 01:04.390
Long time, no see.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.460
Nobody gave you
an invite, Walker.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.830
My badge is my invite, Curly.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.500
Does anyone here
know Snake Larkin?

01:17.510 --> 01:19.540
He used to run with Blackjack.

01:21.380 --> 01:22.580
CURLY:
Come on.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.410
Everybody in here used
to run with Blackjack.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.410
We don't
give up our own.

01:27.850 --> 01:32.090
I believe in family values, too,
Curly, but...

01:32.090 --> 01:33.650
your idea of family

01:33.660 --> 01:35.990
sucks the high wind.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.960
( grunts )

01:41.960 --> 01:42.960
( screaming )

01:44.970 --> 01:46.330
Nice seeing you, Curly.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.100
( moaning )

01:50.110 --> 01:51.100
Where's Snake?

01:51.110 --> 01:52.870
Who's Snake?

01:52.880 --> 01:53.910
Never mind.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.410

For the last time.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.660
Where's Snake Larkin?

02:17.100 --> 02:18.900
SNAKE:
Over here, Ranger.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.750
I'm Snake Larkin.

02:35.450 --> 02:37.680

TRIVETTE:
I can't believe I did it.

03:26.370 --> 03:28.570
Somebody tell me why
I was so stupid

03:28.570 --> 03:30.070
as to volunteer for this gig.

03:30.070 --> 03:31.710
Because you're a dedicated man,
Trivette,

03:31.710 --> 03:33.370
and that's what it takes.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.540
No, no.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.240
Because I'm low man
on the totem pole.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.880
Because I'm expendable,
and 'cause you're not.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.490
Well, don't anybody just jump
in and argue with me here.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.650
ALEX:
Look.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.960
You both know I wasn't
in favor of this.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.960
But you guys did a great job
setting Trivette's cover.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.830
Blackjack's crew will get word
to him about the bust,

03:54.830 --> 03:56.230
You'll go in with solid
credentials,

03:56.230 --> 03:58.070
and that should make it easier
to get next to him.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.530
Then we can find out
if this drug ring

03:59.540 --> 04:00.900
is operating inside the prison.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.770
So when I'm done with this job,
do I get paroled or what?

04:06.210 --> 04:07.340
Walker.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.180
Mm.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.340
Warden Sikes
is in on this.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.810
If you have any trouble
whatsoever,

04:12.820 --> 04:14.510
you just get to him.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.880
Is this just me,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.920
or is this beginning to sound
like one of those movies

04:17.920 --> 04:20.350
where the brave reporter
goes undercover in a prison,

04:20.360 --> 04:22.019
and the only person
who knows about it

04:22.019 --> 04:23.620
happens to die
of a heart attack,

04:23.630 --> 04:24.960
and then
the brave reporter

04:24.960 --> 04:27.090
ends up spending his life
doing life?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.000
Now you know the reason
I didn't volunteer.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.200
You're really building
my confidence.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.370
You better get down to holding.

04:32.370 --> 04:34.170
You're on the next bus
to Huntsville,

04:34.170 --> 04:35.370
and it leaves within the hour.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.100
See, now, even a real convict
has a chance

04:37.110 --> 04:38.440
to put his affairs in order.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.040
Well, if the affair
you're talking about

04:40.040 --> 04:41.570
is Lainie the dispatcher,

04:41.580 --> 04:43.040
she'll be here when you get out.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.610
You see?
He's loving this.

04:44.610 --> 04:45.780
Let's go.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.410
You guys can kid all you want.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.480
But what you're planning to do
is extremely dangerous.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.080
If they even suspect
that you're a plant,

04:52.090 --> 04:53.650
they won't hesitate
to kill you.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.960
BOTH:
Ooh.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.200
Hi, Cordell.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.000
I just wanted to check

05:08.000 --> 05:09.640
and see if your luck
had changed yet.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.410
My luck had changed?

05:11.410 --> 05:12.410
Yeah.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.680
Dang it, C.D.,

05:16.680 --> 05:18.450
I told you not to send me
another chain letter.

05:18.450 --> 05:21.080
That's not an ordinary
chain letter.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.150
That was written
by a Peruvian monk in 1947.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.960
That very letter has been
around the world nine times.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.930
Let it go around the world
ten times without me.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.590
I know how you feel,
Cordell.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.230
I was the same way.

05:35.230 --> 05:38.430
One time I passed four days.
You know what happened to me?

05:38.430 --> 05:40.770
My business went to hell
in a hand basket.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.740
Termites ate down my smokehouse.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.440
The IRS notified me
that I was under audit.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.670
This is very, very
strong medicine.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.910
TRIVETTE:
Hey, Walker.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.010
You need a lucky rabbit's foot,
like me, man.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.080
Yeah, lucky for you,
not for the rabbit.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.820
C.D.:
Look, Cordell,
I'm begging you,

05:56.820 --> 05:58.820
the last guy that
broke this chain

05:58.820 --> 06:01.250
had a hell of a lot of bad luck.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.090
Lightning struck a tree.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.390
The tree fell on his home.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.330
His wife was eating,
and she swallowed

06:06.330 --> 06:07.560
an entire runaki.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.630
"Runaki"?

06:08.630 --> 06:10.800
Yeah, a piece of wood
with meat on its end.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.000
"Rumaki," C.D.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.070
They spent $15,000
getting it out of her throat.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.970
Sounds critical, Walker.
Better listen to him.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.300
Then let him send you one.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.040
C.D.:
All right.
Let's just put it this way.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.140
The good Lord
put up the goal post.

06:22.140 --> 06:27.210
We can play this game
any way we wanna play it.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.150
If you don't forward
that letter,

06:29.150 --> 06:31.420
go ahead and tear it up.
Just tear it up.

Oh, my God, no.

06:38.890 --> 06:40.790
You're out of your mind.

You must be out of your head.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.770
Do you realize
what you've done?

06:47.770 --> 06:50.540
That's a very dangerous
thing to be doing.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.800

06:51.810 --> 06:55.440
Dire circumstances can arise
out of something like that.

Hi, Trivette.

I tried to call you
last night for dinner.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.460
I was at my mom's.
I got your message really late.

What's up with the new look?

He's going away for a while.

Away?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.070
Yeah.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.140
He'll just slow us down.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.750
He's our ticket out
for down the line.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.310
I've got a family.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.280
We love you, too,
O'Malley.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.280
Come on.

C.D.,

12:33.480 --> 12:35.520
if I wasn't a man
of great reason,

12:35.520 --> 12:37.550
I'd be tempted to lay
this hurricane business

12:37.550 --> 12:39.350
at your doorstep.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.020
You and that chain letter.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.990
WALKER:
Speaking of chain letters,

12:44.230 --> 12:45.490
why did you
send me another one?

12:45.490 --> 12:46.860
That's not another one.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.500
This is a replacement of the one
you accidentally tore up.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.070
C.D., you were
a Ranger for 25 years?

12:53.070 --> 12:54.800
28 years, young lady,

12:54.800 --> 12:56.740
unless I've lost
some years along the way.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.470
I should think
you'd know the penalty

12:58.470 --> 12:59.610
for sending this stuff

12:59.610 --> 13:01.370
through the federal
postal system.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.580
Clause five says,
"Send no cash."

13:04.950 --> 13:06.380
Faith has no price.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.310
It's still
emotional extortion.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.580
John Doe A inherited

broke the chain

13:12.950 --> 13:13.990
and then died nine...

...days later.

13:18.630 --> 13:19.730
Well, garden seed.

13:19.730 --> 13:21.260
Look at that, Alex.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.830
Just look at that.

13:22.830 --> 13:25.130
And look at this roof.
It's just like a sieve.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.630
That's proof.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.540
WALKER:
Don't argue with him, Alex.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.470
Since he's retired,
his brain's gone sideways.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.310
Hello. C.D.'s.

No, we're closed.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.220
What?

13:44.220 --> 13:46.820
All right, just a minute.
Alex.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.330
Alex Cahill.

13:56.330 --> 13:57.330
Yes.

What?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.500
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

14:02.500 --> 14:04.200
Are you sure?

14:06.370 --> 14:08.210
When was the last time
you talked to the warden?

14:09.710 --> 14:10.710
Try again.

14:10.710 --> 14:13.480
Yes, right now.
Call me back.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.220
WALKER:
What about the warden?

14:16.220 --> 14:17.320
Is Trivette okay?

14:17.320 --> 14:20.150
The bus...
It never got there, Walker.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.790
They thought it would be late
because of the storm,

14:22.790 --> 14:24.460
but it's three hours overdue.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.760
Where do you think
you're going?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.200
Walker.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.630
( door opens )

14:31.630 --> 14:32.970
Walker, are you crazy?

14:32.970 --> 14:34.330
There's a hurricane out there!

14:34.340 --> 14:36.200
( door shuts )

14:37.970 --> 14:40.270
Uncle Ray,
what can he hope to do?

14:40.270 --> 14:42.680
My son never hopes.
He just does.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.850
When Cordell Walker
saddles up to somethin',

14:50.850 --> 14:52.550
nobody can stop him.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.020
Not even the wrath of God.

( thunder crashes )

15:10.440 --> 15:11.640
How you coming?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.940
Almost got everything
boarded up out there.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.410
It's bad.
Yeah.

15:15.410 --> 15:16.910
It's like
a morgue up there.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.310
I guess everybody
got out okay.

15:18.310 --> 15:21.010
Got out? When that trooper
arrived, it was like a stampede.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.820
I'm not sure it was
necessary to evacuate.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.050
Well,
think of the complaints.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.520
As soon as the electricity goes,

15:25.520 --> 15:28.450
the elevator won't work.
We won't be able to serve meals.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.820
Can you imagine the lawsuit

15:29.820 --> 15:31.320
if somebody got hit
by flying glass?

15:31.330 --> 15:32.590
Did you see Robin leave?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.160
She probably left
with her boyfriend.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.460
Mr. Charm.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.900
She picked him.
I didn't.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.530
INMATE:
Get him in here,
get him in here.

There you go, new boy.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.700
Relax.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.900
Give us a big smile.

Be stupid if you want to,
Rollins, but not me.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.370
He's right, man.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.110
Shouldn't we post
lookouts or somethin'?

16:59.280 --> 17:02.950
Hicks, you been
institutionalized too long.

17:02.950 --> 17:05.550
We're five miles
in the middle of nowhere.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.319
The only way cops
are going to reach us

17:08.319 --> 17:10.720
is by tractor
or submarine.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.190
Minute it lets up,
we're out of here.

17:13.190 --> 17:15.530

we're safe.

And your wife?

I'd like to hear her say it.

propose to you in a minute. Mm.

Don't worry, Mrs. Sant.
No one's gonna hurt you.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.850
Soon as the storm's over,
we'll be gone.

18:06.850 --> 18:09.750
But we'll need
transportation.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.890
In the garage, there's a van
and a pickup truck. Here.

Seeing as how you and Gomez

19:14.580 --> 19:17.120
are gonna be the only two
that are completely sober,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.050
and you get along so well,

19:19.050 --> 19:21.320
maybe you could go help
keep an eye on our guest.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.420
Yeah, all right.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.130

Now, take him inside.

eat this, huh?

Look, all you guys have to do

20:23.380 --> 20:24.920
is just turn your head
for five seconds,

20:24.920 --> 20:26.180
and I'm gone, okay?

20:26.190 --> 20:28.650
When this is all over,
I'll tell them you helped me.

Shh! Take it easy.
Take it easy.

find my way back.

to deal with it.

by a group of escaped convicts.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.090
gonna be outside swimming back
to Galveston. Understand?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.600
INMATE:
Yeah, we understand.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.660
You want her all for yourself.

24:33.630 --> 24:35.230
(<i> action theme playing</i> )

24:36.440 --> 24:37.970
( crashing and grunting )

24:40.110 --> 24:41.170
Get him!
Get him!

24:44.780 --> 24:45.780
You told me--

24:49.680 --> 24:51.080
That's twice I've seen it now.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.320
You move like lightning, bucko.

24:56.190 --> 24:59.660
( whispers ):
I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.800
( thunder crashing )

25:07.800 --> 25:10.440
Please let
Cathy and Dick be all right.

25:16.910 --> 25:19.750
( muffled grunting )

25:30.360 --> 25:33.060
So tell me, mate.
What'd you mean back there?

25:33.060 --> 25:36.390
What was all that
"you said" guff?

25:39.430 --> 25:41.530
He said he'd kill me.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.040
( thunder crashing )

25:49.840 --> 25:52.710
Why don't we give O'Malley
a taste of what it's like.

25:52.710 --> 25:55.080
Go stick him in the closet.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.980
A small, dark closet.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.950
As small and dark
as I can find.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.590
( grunting )

26:05.490 --> 26:08.430
Hey.

26:08.430 --> 26:10.830
Where'd you get
that speed of yours, bucko?

26:12.870 --> 26:16.940
High school football,
bucko.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.700
You move
at the speed of sound.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.640
Gonna have to
keep my eye on you.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.880
Yeah.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.610
Yeah.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.320
Well, I understand that.
Yeah.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.690
Just-- Just keep trying
to get through, will ya?

26:33.690 --> 26:36.560
Please.
Yeah, much obliged.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.530
Still no word?

26:43.860 --> 26:47.130
Not from the bus
or from Walker.

26:47.130 --> 26:51.000
Well, he'll need this fire
when he returns.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.840
You're so sure
he's gonna be okay.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.180
Look here, young lady.

26:56.180 --> 26:59.110
Washoe's in harmony
with the spirits around him.

26:59.110 --> 27:00.910
They'll take care of him.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.120
What if...

27:03.120 --> 27:04.880
What if the prisoners
got loose?

27:04.890 --> 27:06.820
Washoe's smarter and meaner

27:06.820 --> 27:08.950
than any prisoner I ever knew.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.660
If you're gonna
waste your time worrying,

27:10.660 --> 27:11.760
worry about them.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.500
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

27:21.700 --> 27:24.770
You're the ugliest sucker
I've ever seen.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.310
( grunting, blows landing )

27:37.480 --> 27:38.820
Ah.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.350
You did a great job, Robin.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.120
Yeah, for a cripple.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.590
Why are you feeling
so sorry for yourself?

27:44.590 --> 27:46.820
I mean, there's millions
of handicapped people out there

27:46.830 --> 27:48.560
living very productive lives.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
I had a productive life.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.200
I was the resident golf pro

27:52.200 --> 27:54.630
at Cathy and Dick's
hotel in Arizona.

27:54.630 --> 27:55.800
When the accident happened,

27:55.800 --> 27:57.800
my fiancé said
he still loved me.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.410
We'd work
through it together.

27:59.410 --> 28:02.410
I never heard from him again
when I got out of the hospital.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.930
Jeez--

28:28.800 --> 28:29.900
Easy.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.670
( panting )

28:31.670 --> 28:33.000
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.810
Never relax, Trivette.
It'll get you killed.

28:34.810 --> 28:36.240
Relax?
Do I look relaxed to you?

28:36.240 --> 28:38.410
How are the hostages doing?

28:38.410 --> 28:39.510
Okay, so far.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.350
Well, we got another problem.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.680
There's a woman upstairs
who's trying to commit suicide.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.480
You got to be kidding me.

28:45.490 --> 28:46.620
Yeah,
she's in a wheelchair.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.090
Drunk driver hit her
six months ago,

28:48.090 --> 28:49.150
and she can't move her legs.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.760
So, what are we
gonna do about her?

28:50.760 --> 28:52.820
Well, I've got her
calmed down for now.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.130
That's all we need
is for those convicts

28:55.130 --> 28:57.600
to hear something
and start searching this place.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.530
Especially since
one of them's missing already.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.370
I don't suppose
you know anything about that?

29:01.370 --> 29:02.470
About what?
Hey!

29:02.470 --> 29:03.700
That's my butt down there,
man.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.270
If you just keep
pulling those guys out.

29:05.270 --> 29:06.840
When you just picking
guys off--
Okay.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.570
Where you headed?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.910
Rawlins or Rollins
sent me to check on that guy.

29:10.910 --> 29:12.840
Rawlins, Rollins?
How do you spell it?

29:12.850 --> 29:14.280
R-O--

29:14.280 --> 29:15.580
Only kidding.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.720
( sighs )

29:16.720 --> 29:18.120
Let me tell you something.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.720
That's the head honcho,
and he needs his tires rotated.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.020
Then tell him that his buddy
took off in the hotel van.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.260
Okay.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.090
When I see Rollins,

29:27.090 --> 29:29.230
I'm gonna rotate
his tires for him...

29:29.230 --> 29:31.260
and clean his carburetor,
to boot.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.460
I believe you.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.900
Write if you get work.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.820
( gun cocks )
Hold it!

30:00.230 --> 30:02.030
Turn around.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.960

30:05.970 --> 30:07.600
( laughing )

30:07.600 --> 30:10.970
Rollins is gonna
want to talk to you.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.900
Let's go.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.920
( Robin grunts )

30:36.060 --> 30:37.100
You okay?

30:37.100 --> 30:39.000
I'm fine.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.830
I can get up myself.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.540
I know you can.

30:43.540 --> 30:47.940
Then I wouldn't have
got a chance to put
my arms around you.

30:49.210 --> 30:52.780
( thunder rumbling )

30:55.280 --> 30:57.520
You two okay?

30:57.520 --> 31:00.150
( thunder crashing )

31:05.860 --> 31:07.360
You know, Dick,
it occurs to me

31:07.360 --> 31:09.490
there must be a safe
somewhere in this hotel

31:09.500 --> 31:12.930
with a considerable
amount of cash in it.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.400
Am I right?

31:14.400 --> 31:17.800
It's just some petty cash.

31:17.800 --> 31:18.970
Would you be so kind

31:18.970 --> 31:20.340
as to go with
those two gentlemen

31:20.340 --> 31:22.440
and get however much
there is?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.910
Gomez, Hicks!

31:28.820 --> 31:30.780
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

31:30.780 --> 31:33.490
Oh, don't worry, Dick.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.620
She'll be fine.
You got my word on it.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.760
( Gomez and Hicks chattering )

31:46.370 --> 31:48.900
Spangler,
go call your mother.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.600
My mother's dead.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.540
Well,
go call her anyway.

32:05.550 --> 32:06.950
Look, Mrs. Sant.

32:06.950 --> 32:09.720
Cathy.
I know you're upset.

32:13.090 --> 32:14.660
"We have no choice
in the matter"

32:14.660 --> 32:16.730
is about how I can say it,
Cathy girl.

32:16.730 --> 32:18.730
We're just human beings,

32:18.730 --> 32:21.170
just like you and your husband.
Just men.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.530
Why don't you let us go.

32:37.150 --> 32:39.120
( whispering ):
Oh, Catherine.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.290
Pretty Catherine.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.690
Don't be afraid of me.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.700
Nothing happens
if we don't want it to.

32:54.530 --> 32:55.530
Hey, Rollins.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.100
Can't find Fly, man.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.570
And your van's gone.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.480
( sobbing quietly )

33:09.020 --> 33:11.350
GOMEZ:
Yo, Rollins!
Rollins!

33:11.350 --> 33:13.550
Yo, Rollins.
Man, we hit pay dirt.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.050
Five grand.

33:21.190 --> 33:22.860
Seems to me
you underestimated

33:22.860 --> 33:25.530
the amount of cash
in your safe, Dick.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.930
Good thing
it wasn't intentional.

33:27.930 --> 33:29.870
Now, go sit with your wife.

33:29.870 --> 33:31.170

33:31.170 --> 33:33.240
I can't take too much more
of this storm, man.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.410
The sound's driving me nuts.
Yo, man.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.410
You keep it up, knucklehead,
I'm gonna slash you up.

33:37.410 --> 33:38.640
Why don't you chill, man.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.450
Yo, who you talkin' to, Snake?

33:40.450 --> 33:42.450
I'm just sayin'
it's no time to lose your cool.

33:42.450 --> 33:43.950
And you don't need
to mess with him.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.120
We're gonna be outta here soon.

you wasn't even alive to me.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.690
Now, I don't know who you are
or why we brought you along--

33:51.690 --> 33:53.360
Stop pointing that knife at pe--

What you gonna do, man?
What you gonna do?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.230
( rustling nearby )

33:56.230 --> 33:57.700
Right. Hold it, everyone.
Shut up!

34:04.710 --> 34:06.000

34:06.010 --> 34:08.610

It's probably just the storm.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.270
Well,
then it's just the storm.

So go check it out.

you big knucklehead.

in a wheelchair here.

What are you talkin' about?
Here in the hotel?

35:01.830 --> 35:03.730
Yeah. She just--
She just smiled at me.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.930
Come on.
Come on. Come on!

35:08.900 --> 35:10.300
You go that way.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.640
Hurry up. Go that way.
All right!

35:19.010 --> 35:20.780
I'm not crazy.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.280
And just who are you?

The last person you'll see
before lights out.

Yes.

35:53.010 --> 35:55.150
What's going on?
I-I don't know.

35:55.150 --> 35:57.450
It's Spangler. Span--
He's wigging out.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.680
What? About what?
Where's Tripp?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.250
What, he's gone too?

36:02.260 --> 36:04.490
GOMEZ:
He said there's
somebody else in the hotel.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.190
I knew it. That's
what happened to Fly.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.030
Man, there ain't nobody else
in this hotel.

36:09.030 --> 36:10.560
Yeah, yeah.
H-he said there's some...

chick in a wheelchair?

36:12.130 --> 36:14.200
Come on.
Yeah, yeah.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.670
Man, that's what
Spangler said, man.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.240
There's some-- Some--
Some invalid broad?

36:18.240 --> 36:21.010
Some invalid broad took out
Fly and Spangler and Tripp.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.440
Man, get real.
HICKS: You'd be surprised.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.440

38:11.280 --> 38:13.120
They're searching this place
floor by floor.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.020
I came up the back stairs.
A couple of other people

38:15.020 --> 38:16.420
took the elevator
to three and four.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.060
( elevator bell dings )

38:19.060 --> 38:22.460
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

38:29.800 --> 38:31.170
GOMEZ:
What the hell?

38:38.180 --> 38:39.210
Hey, Snake!

38:39.210 --> 38:41.250
Snake,
what the hell happened to him?

38:41.250 --> 38:42.710
Man, I don't know.
We split up.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.850
I'm looking down here.

38:43.850 --> 38:45.450
He's supposed
to be looking down--

38:45.450 --> 38:48.220
Oh, and you didn't see anything,
and you didn't hear anything?

38:48.220 --> 38:50.960
No, man. I just
talked to him a minute ago.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.260
Whoever got him must've

38:52.260 --> 38:53.960
went down the steps
or down the elevator.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.560
Yeah, right.
Unless you did it yourself.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.230
Oh, yeah, right, Gomez.

38:57.230 --> 38:59.660
Even if I did, man, at least
you don't have to listen to him

38:59.670 --> 39:01.230
crying about
the storm anymore.

39:01.230 --> 39:03.000
Get out of here.
Hey,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.870
take him downstairs.
I'm gonna go check up here.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.340
All right.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.610
Wow.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.590
Hey,
that was pretty slick, Trivette.

39:22.590 --> 39:23.920
( door closes )

39:23.920 --> 39:26.390
Don't encourage him.
Flattery goes to his head.

39:26.390 --> 39:27.430
( chuckles )

39:27.430 --> 39:28.690
Okay, now what?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.030
Well, I think it's time
to go for the kill shot.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.200
Take Rollins out.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.930
Now, he's down there
with the Sants.

39:33.930 --> 39:36.000
I don't know if we can
get him before he gets them.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.900
When I was downstairs,
I noticed the main breaker

39:37.900 --> 39:40.600
for the hotel's
electrical system.

39:40.610 --> 39:42.210
You get back to Rollins,

39:42.210 --> 39:45.280
and at exactly 3:10,
I'll pull the main.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.810
You grab Dick and Cathy
and get the heck outta there.

39:47.810 --> 39:50.180
I'll count to ten
and throw it back on.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.750
Is there anything
I can do to help?

39:51.750 --> 39:55.350
(<i> tender theme playing</i> )

39:55.360 --> 39:57.090
Robin, you've been
a real trouper.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.620
I couldn't have done this
without you.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.830
But now it's time for
Trivette and I to finish it.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.860
So I'd like for you
to wait here.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.930
Okay?

40:22.180 --> 40:24.420
What time do you got?
Okay, I got 2:58.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.680
So I'll meet you
downstairs at--

40:25.690 --> 40:27.550
( gun cocks )
I got me two Texas Rangers.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.490
Back up, boys.

40:29.490 --> 40:31.920
Back up.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.260
Let me have your gun.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.460
Now, move. Move!

40:38.470 --> 40:40.130
Let's go.

40:40.130 --> 40:43.500
Got me two
Texas Rangers here, huh?

40:43.500 --> 40:44.700
Okay, you guys.
Right here.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.370
Down the stairs.
Let's go.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.520
Hey, Rollins!

41:00.520 --> 41:01.690
Rollins,
look what I got here.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.560

41:05.160 --> 41:06.460
We ain't dealing
with no invalid

41:06.460 --> 41:08.730
in a wheelchair after all.

41:08.730 --> 41:09.790

Robin?

41:14.230 --> 41:15.970
( grunting )

41:15.970 --> 41:17.040
Ohh!

41:17.040 --> 41:18.340
Well, well,
look who we got here.

41:19.270 --> 41:20.710
( thunder crashing )

41:22.380 --> 41:25.640
A couple of living,
breathing Texas Rangers.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.810
Oh. Man, you're not going
paranoid on me like Gomez.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.920
Don't you recognize this guy?
This guy brought me down

41:30.920 --> 41:32.980
from Fort Worth.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.620
Oh, yeah. I saw that
little exhibition, remember?

41:36.560 --> 41:37.820
Fascinating, isn't it?

41:37.820 --> 41:40.590
Here we were, so trusting.

41:40.590 --> 41:43.700
So willing to share our fortune.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.430
And all the time
there was a wolf among us

41:45.430 --> 41:47.200
in sheep's clothing.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.770

Stinkin' snitch.
You know,

42:01.110 --> 42:03.310
I knew there was something funny
about this guy.

42:03.320 --> 42:07.080
You know,
I'm truly sorry about this.

42:07.090 --> 42:09.220
Killing really wasn't
part of my plan.

What about it, Walker?

You must've been
as surprised as they were

when those lights went out.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.270
No.

I was counting on you.

I could do it?

that gourmet chili

like there's no tomorrow.

Hey, C.D.,
how about another bowl?

Yes, ma'am.
We got ten gallons of it left.

try to make but couldn't.

Well,
put some more pepper in it.

You need to spice it up some.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.650
It'll put hair on your chest.

You need that, don't you?

Aren't you even gonna try it?

No, no.

you guys are eating any of it.
