WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.579
Audrey: Previously on Haven...

00:02.670 --> 00:05.036
- Bringing Audrey back,
that is how we get rid of Mara.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.087
Audrey is still in there.
We got to get her out.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.837
- So Audrey was
rattling around inside of me.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.755
I'm going to kill that bitch
right now.

00:11.846 --> 00:12.926
- Do you really think

00:13.014 --> 00:15.050
I can let out
a reincarnation trouble?

00:15.141 --> 00:16.256
- Maybe we'll use that on Mara,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.681
get Audrey to pop out.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.553
(whooshing, groaning)

00:24.650 --> 00:28.108
(panting)

00:30.239 --> 00:31.740
(gasping)

00:33.284 --> 00:34.273
(shivering)

00:35.578 --> 00:37.034
- Thank you.

00:37.121 --> 00:42.286
J‘J‘

00:43.669 --> 00:45.170
(waves lapping, bell dinging)

00:45.254 --> 00:46.334
Duke: I don't know...
There's nothing in here

00:46.422 --> 00:48.754
about splitting personality
or making new bodies.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.175
Maybe I did use the right curse,

00:53.262 --> 00:56.220
and itjust... Mutated.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.130
Or something.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.763
- Or maybe you used one
you don't know about.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.809
I mean, I can't imagine
a family of serial killers

01:02.897 --> 01:04.933
kept perfect records,
no offense.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.230
- None taken.

01:06.317 --> 01:07.932
- So it's official.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.564
- Absolutely no idea.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.731
- Thank God it did.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.524
You're here.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.235
(sighs)

01:20.081 --> 01:21.571
How do you feel?

01:22.667 --> 01:24.407
- I'm-II

01:24.502 --> 01:25.787
BEE!

01:25.878 --> 01:30.497
For the first time,
it's just me.

01:33.511 --> 01:37.174
- But now we have, below deck...
- Mara.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.096
- I don't understand.
If the Guard wants her so bad,

01:39.183 --> 01:40.593
why can't we just
give her to them?

01:40.685 --> 01:42.641
- I agree.
- No, we can't.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.229
Dwight just left town.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.224
- Dwight just left town where?

01:46.315 --> 01:48.271
- He wouldn't say.
But without him around,

01:48.359 --> 01:50.725
there's no telling
what the Guard will do to her.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.435
- And that's our problem how?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.482
- What if you're connected,

01:57.576 --> 01:58.782
like with William?

01:59.453 --> 02:02.115
Something happens to Mara,
what happens to you?

02:02.206 --> 02:04.037
Look, I don't like it,
but we can't risk it.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.958
We... we have to... protect her.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.829
- This chick is
public enemy number one.

02:10.923 --> 02:14.711
We're gonna have to keep her
a secret from... everyone.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.794
- The idea of being connected
to her makes my skin crawl.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.422
I'm done with her.

02:21.517 --> 02:26.432
I'm just going to be
Audrey Parker, for good.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.058
- All right, then it's decided.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.435
We keep her here until we can
turn her back over to Dwight.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.732
That's the plan.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.069
- Listen, I'm--
I'm tired.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.820
I really just want to go
home and take a shower.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.818
It's been a long day.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.327
J‘J‘

02:47.418 --> 02:48.783
- What do you think?

02:48.878 --> 02:50.914
- She doesn't want to go
anywhere near Mara.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.120
I don't blame her.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.750
We don't know how
this split thing works.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.830
We don't know anything.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.086
- Mara might.
- Well, maybe, but...

02:57.178 --> 02:59.169
you think she's
gonna help us?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.170
- No.

03:01.724 --> 03:04.386
- I'm gonna... go with Audrey.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.097
See you later.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.190
J‘J‘

03:12.276 --> 03:14.392
(lock clattering, chains rattling)

03:16.822 --> 03:19.029
- When's my phone call?

03:19.116 --> 03:22.028
I want to speak
to my new twin sis.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.570
- I see the confusion.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.581
You... think you have rights.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.287
How do I put this politely?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.368
You don't.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.294
You are alive for one reason:

03:34.382 --> 03:35.542
your connection to Audrey.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.248
- My what?

03:39.011 --> 03:40.217
- Don't play dumb.

03:41.847 --> 03:42.836
- Oh, right.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.720
You mean howl can sense
her out there.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.184
How right now
she's feeling very...

03:53.901 --> 03:56.108
hungry,

03:56.195 --> 03:59.562
because she's always hungry.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.694
You have no idea
if we're connected.

04:02.785 --> 04:04.776
You want me to tell you.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.240
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.447
Well, this is how
this is going to work.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.498
I will tell you what I know,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.246
but you must give me
something first.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.745
The Crocker family journal.

04:17.967 --> 04:20.674
- Now, why would you want that?
- I could use a good read.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.001
- It's just a list
of all the Troubles

04:22.096 --> 04:23.336
that my family's ended.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.422
(chuckles)

04:26.559 --> 04:28.015
You want to know what they are

04:28.102 --> 04:30.593
because, for some reason,

04:30.688 --> 04:33.020
you're not immune
to what's in me.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.814
Well, I don't know
how to break it to you,

04:35.901 --> 04:38.017
but you're not getting it.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.101
- Well, all right, then.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.525
- I'm done talking.
- That's fine, actually,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.323
because there are other
ways to find out.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.736
Uh... Ah!

04:51.083 --> 04:52.072
(clatters)

04:52.668 --> 04:53.657
- Torture?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.202
No...
You don't have it in you.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.833
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.839
I'm just gonna take
one of your toes.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.257
- What?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.595
- Yeah.
(thudding and clattering)

05:03.679 --> 05:04.885
Your toe.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.634
You see, if you and Audrey
really are connected,

05:07.725 --> 05:09.556
well, then she'll
lose one of hers too,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.474
and then we'll know, right?

05:12.563 --> 05:15.225
- What is it with you boys
and feet?

05:15.316 --> 05:16.305
No.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.389
You're bluffing.

05:17.485 --> 05:20.067
(rattling)
- And you are stalling.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.143
I don't know what
the big deal is.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.899
I mean, it's just a toe.
You won't even miss it.

05:24.950 --> 05:25.939
- And if we are connected,

05:26.035 --> 05:27.366
are you gonna give Audrey
the same speech?

05:27.453 --> 05:29.865
How you just took a toe
and it's really no big deal?

05:30.831 --> 05:34.824
J‘J‘

05:39.173 --> 05:40.162
(chuckles)

05:41.091 --> 05:43.548
Get used to that feeling, Duke.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.592
This isn't going to be easy.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.715
I may be the one stuck
down here...

05:47.806 --> 05:48.795
(clattering)

05:48.891 --> 05:50.722
but you're the ones
in over your heads.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.144
J‘J‘

06:25.553 --> 06:30.388
J‘J‘

06:30.891 --> 06:32.222
(moaning softly)

06:35.980 --> 06:38.266
(phone buzzes)

06:38.357 --> 06:39.893
(sighing)

06:39.984 --> 06:42.566
(buzzing continues)

06:48.033 --> 06:49.614
(buzzing continues)

06:53.914 --> 06:55.654
- Uh-oh.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.738
Case face.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.950
I miss that face.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.785
- Three dead,

07:01.880 --> 07:03.131
all at the same time,

07:03.215 --> 07:05.206
all the same way, all weird.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.586
I don't think it's
anything serious.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.598
Let's just stay here.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.005
- Nathan.
- Mm-hmm?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.720
- This is what we do, all right?

07:15.811 --> 07:16.926
We're that couple.

07:20.024 --> 07:23.687
Are you afraid that people
are gonna confuse me with Mara?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.608
- No.
It's not that.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.572
I already put the word out
that you're you now.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.695
The split personality is gone.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.031
- Okay, so, then the best way
for me to prove that I'm Audrey

07:39.126 --> 07:42.664
is to solve another Trouble
again, right?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.121
What's wrong?

07:49.678 --> 07:52.135
- I don't think you're immune
to the Troubles anymore.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.797
Maybe it was the split.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.257
- Why would you think that?

07:59.605 --> 08:02.438
- Because I can't
feel you anymore.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.198
- But what about
last night and...

08:14.286 --> 08:15.492
this morning?
(chuckles)

08:15.704 --> 08:18.036
- Doesn't matter...to me.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.995
- Well... that much is clear.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.464
ljust-- I don't...

08:27.841 --> 08:30.332
I don't understand why you
wouldn't tell me right away.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.680
- Didn't want to scare you.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.923
Didn't know what it meant.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.977
J‘J‘

08:42.064 --> 08:45.682
- I guess it means that...
I'm my own person.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.481
I'm just... normal.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.863
I'm not any less immune
to the Troubles than you are.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.985
Solving Troubles is what we do,

08:58.163 --> 08:59.152
so...

09:01.166 --> 09:04.750
we should just go out there and...
and be us.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.005
J‘J‘

09:14.096 --> 09:15.961
woman: You gave us
all the information you could,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.796
and that's all that you can do.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.678
We're gonna find the guy
who did this.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.852
- I am so... so sorry
for your loss.

09:23.939 --> 09:24.928
- You.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.400
People talk about you.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.399
You're a monster.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.777
My husband, you killed him,
didn't you?

09:32.865 --> 09:34.401
- This is Detective Parker.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.825
She only looks like that woman.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.572
Okay, we-we better get you going.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.665
- Rebecca, I appreciate that.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.745
- Yeah, well,
it's Nathan's orders.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.879
- Where's the body, officer?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.005
- There isn't one.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.720
Look.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.185
That's all that's left.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.308
She said he'd just come home
from the farmer's market,

10:07.399 --> 10:09.890
and there was this
sudden burst of light,

10:09.985 --> 10:12.101
then just this.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.903
- Looks like what happens at
ground zero of a nuclear blast.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.981
People get incinerated
in a flash.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.857
- There were two
other victims in town today,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.908
an apple farmer and a chef.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.113
And these shadows were all
that was left of them, too.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.039
- You said he just came
home from the farmer's market?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.458
-Mmmmm.
- The others were probably there, too.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.831
- Thanks.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.788
- Let's go check out the market.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.587
- I think I should go alone.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.929
You saw how that woman reacted,

10:38.013 --> 10:39.378
even Rafferty.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.464
People are scared
you're still Mara.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.227
It could get serious next time.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.222
- I'll just convince them
that I'm me.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.428
- Well, it's gonna take a while,

10:47.523 --> 10:48.729
especially since
we can't tell them

10:48.816 --> 10:51.558
that we're protecting
the real Mara.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.064
So I'm just asking you
to sit this one out.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.315
Just give it some time.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.657
- Fine.

11:01.787 --> 11:05.325
(music playing, chatter)

11:20.722 --> 11:24.715
J‘J‘

11:36.738 --> 11:37.727
- Well, I'm detective--

11:37.823 --> 11:39.688
- I know who you are, Wuornos.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.772
Traitor.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.446
You don't deserve
to wear this.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.029
- You want to tell me what
you're doing here, Mister...

11:48.125 --> 11:49.114
- Reggie.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.875
I'm watching out for
these people.

11:53.547 --> 11:57.631
Some of us, we take it upon
ourselves to protect this town.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.800
- But you still
have to answer to Dwight.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.423
- Not when he ain't around.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.379
- You know about
the incineration Trouble

12:04.474 --> 12:05.680
around town today?

12:05.934 --> 12:06.923
- Heard talk.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.185
- That's it.
- All the victims

12:10.272 --> 12:12.137
were probably here first.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.097
Were you here?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.524
- Boy, you got some nerve,
accusing me.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.854
You kept the Troubles here.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.564
You pal around
with Crocker,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.320
the Troubled killer,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.403
and you're screwing
that bitch who cursed us all.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.993
- What is your Trouble, Reggie?

12:30.083 --> 12:33.667
- Boy, you ain't getting
anything out of me.

12:35.714 --> 12:40.048
One day,
somebody gonna do what's right:

12:40.135 --> 12:42.547
take you down,

12:42.638 --> 12:45.050
make her pay
for what she did.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.129
Till then...

12:48.060 --> 12:49.300
we'll be watching.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.392
- So nothing
at the farmer's market, huh?

12:58.487 --> 13:01.149
- No, but I got something.
lwent through missing persons,

13:01.239 --> 13:05.448
looking for any signs of these...
atomic shadows at the scenes.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.524
- And this has happened before?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.986
- Yeah.
Found a handful so far.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.197
Shadows were less conspicuous,
got overlooked.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.156
So I'm gonna dig
into these old files,

13:13.251 --> 13:14.661
see if I can find any other--

13:19.466 --> 13:20.455
- Nathan.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.332
Nathan?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.594
Hey, hello, Nathan?

13:26.890 --> 13:29.176
J‘J‘

13:31.812 --> 13:32.801
Audrey: Nathan?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.103
- Hello, Nathan?
- Parker.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.266
- Nathan.
- Hello?

13:39.361 --> 13:41.192
- All right,
I'm coming down there right now.

13:41.905 --> 13:47.491
J‘J‘

13:54.835 --> 13:58.623
J‘J‘

14:06.847 --> 14:07.836
(knocking)

14:08.765 --> 14:11.097
- I got more missing persons
for you.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.437
- Rafferty, I need you to--

14:18.859 --> 14:19.848
(sighs)

14:22.154 --> 14:23.143
Rebecca?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.353
Rebecca.

14:26.992 --> 14:27.981
Okay.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.359
It's Haven.
It could be anything.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.620
(panting)

14:42.716 --> 14:44.297
- What is this?
Rebecca: Lieutenant!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.464
- What is this?

14:46.762 --> 14:50.550
J‘J‘

14:50.640 --> 14:51.800
Rebecca: I'm sorry.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.098
I'm so sorry.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.721
- Audrey.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.310
- Why Nathan?
- I have no idea.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.737
I don't have any
of Mara's memories.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.482
I'm not immune anymore, either.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.776
Oh, God.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.824
- Have any of the other people
that this has happened to--

15:15.916 --> 15:17.622
- have they...
- No.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.243
- Okay, this isn't
a funeral.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.244
Yet.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.710
- This is bad.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.416
- I'm gonna get him back.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.212
(exhales)

15:31.306 --> 15:33.297
We've got a lot of work to do.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.427
I'm gonna pick up
right where he left off.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.010
I'm gonna figure out how
this Trouble works,

15:38.105 --> 15:40.517
and then I'm gonna
reverse it before it's too late.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.309
(sighs)

15:46.822 --> 15:47.811
- All right.

15:47.906 --> 15:48.986
Look, you do your cop thing.

15:49.074 --> 15:52.362
I'll see if I can find anything
in the Crocker book of death.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.192
- Wait, can I ask you something?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.154
I saw Mitchell and some
of his guard buddies outside.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.114
He's staking us out.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.746
Dwight's out of town, so...

16:01.837 --> 16:03.748
could you just get them
off my back?

16:03.839 --> 16:05.079
- Done.

16:05.841 --> 16:06.830
(door opens)

16:07.843 --> 16:08.832
(door closes)

16:10.804 --> 16:12.385
- Audrey.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.298
(exasperated sighing)

16:19.396 --> 16:23.560
J‘J‘

16:24.985 --> 16:26.566
- Won't be long now...
Just keep an eye open.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.441
What do you want, Crocker?

16:30.532 --> 16:32.272
- Now, I know y'all
are real busy

16:32.367 --> 16:33.903
with your guns
and your Troubles,

16:33.994 --> 16:35.484
but, see, I'm gonna need you

16:35.579 --> 16:36.568
and your little
peeping toms here

16:36.663 --> 16:38.949
to leave Audrey alone.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.416
- Sorry, I can't do that.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.912
For what it's worth, though,
I'm really sorry about Wuornos.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.209
Such a waste.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.413
- If you know anything
about what happened to Nathan,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.418
I suggest that you tell me
right now.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.090
- We only know what we heard.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.167
And unlike somebody here,

16:52.262 --> 16:54.093
we don't kill Troubled people.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.429
Besides, come on,
you know who's behind it.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.596
It's her.
It's Mara.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.720
She's been fooling all you guys
since the lighthouse,

16:59.811 --> 17:01.392
and it's still costing lives.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.094
- Look, we've handled it.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.272
You will never see Mara again.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.518
Audrey is just Audrey now.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.271
- Really?
What proof you got?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.476
- You can't tell them
about Mara.

17:09.571 --> 17:10.606
- Exactly, nothing.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.937
- Mitchell, I'm asking you,

17:12.032 --> 17:13.272
let Audrey solve this.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.572
- Let more people die?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.650
- Can't do that, man.
- Do you not understand?

17:16.745 --> 17:17.905
She could actually save lives

17:17.996 --> 17:19.702
and prove that she is Audrey.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.287
So do we have a deal?

17:30.508 --> 17:31.668
- Yeah.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.749
Fine.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.417
We'll see you around, Crocker.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.718
- Looking forward to it.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.976
- We have a deal, until she
slips up, and she will.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.726
And when she does, we take
care of her the way we want to.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.067
- Audrey.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.736
J‘J‘

17:58.912 --> 18:00.322
- Sorry, I didn't know.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.664
- You can see me?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.249
- Yeah, and feel you.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.530
Leave me alone.
I got to go--

18:04.626 --> 18:05.832
- Wait, wait, please.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.455
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.501
No one else can see you either.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.578
- No.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.665
- Do you know what kind
of Trouble this is

18:12.759 --> 18:15.000
or how to reverse it?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.086
- You don't know what you are?

18:17.180 --> 18:18.681
What happened to you?

18:19.391 --> 18:20.506
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.683
- Wait, please, just tell me
what's going on.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.976
I have to end this.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.855
- There is no ending it.

18:28.942 --> 18:29.931
We're ghosts.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.229
You're dead.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.108
J‘J‘

18:40.161 --> 18:42.493
- I just need some answers,
that's it.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.198
Did some kind of atomic flash
make you like this?

18:46.293 --> 18:49.035
- No.
It was a car crash.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.370
Didn't see the other guy coming
until it was too late.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.453
It doesn't matter
what kills you.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.629
You wind up like this
just the same.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.880
- No. If we're dead,
then why are we still here?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.426
- This is purgatory.

18:58.513 --> 18:59.593
We're all just stuck like this

18:59.681 --> 19:00.761
until we figure out
how to move on.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.055
- There are others?

19:02.142 --> 19:04.133
- You're lucky
you found me first.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.683
Some of them are messed up.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.476
Just wandering around.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.725
Watching your loved ones
forget all about you,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.272
gets in your head.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.348
Trust me.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.022
I got to go.
Enjoy your afterlife.

19:15.113 --> 19:19.231
- Hey, I need to help
my partner, talk to her.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.566
Do you know howl can do that?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.446
There has to be a way.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.868
- I don't think so.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.701
But I'll tell you
where you can find out for sure.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.207
The cemetery.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.667
(chatter)

19:37.469 --> 19:39.755
- Good luck.
- Hi, Haven PD.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.882
I'm looking for someone
that may have been here today.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.840
Do you have a record of everyone
that entered the raffle?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.310
- If you want to
start digging, go ahead.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.725
- Why don't you start
making a list for me?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.848
I need any record I can get
of the people that were here.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.687
(camera shutter clicks)

19:58.656 --> 19:59.862
Hi, excuse me.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.368
Detective Parker,
Haven Police Department.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.283
I'm looking for someone that may
have been here today,

20:04.371 --> 20:05.781
and I was noticing
that you were taking pictures.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.078
Do you mind if I look
through those?

20:07.165 --> 20:08.450
- Of course.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.372
Sorry, I hardly use
this thing anymore.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.576
(beeping)

20:15.173 --> 20:17.915
- Oh, stop.
That guy, do you know who that is?

20:18.009 --> 20:20.466
- No, but he was here
all morning

20:20.553 --> 20:22.384
staring at
everybody like a creep.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.383
He got real mad at
that other guy.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.840
- Can you actually send
me everything that you have

20:26.935 --> 20:28.846
of the creep?

20:28.937 --> 20:32.179
He and I need to have
a conversation.

20:37.237 --> 20:42.357
J‘J‘

20:42.450 --> 20:44.736
(crying)

20:47.997 --> 20:49.077
- Excuse me, miss?

20:52.293 --> 20:54.454
(crying)

20:54.546 --> 20:55.626
You okay?

20:57.924 --> 20:58.913
Hello?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.919
(crying grows louder)
Can you hear me?

21:01.010 --> 21:01.999
- Help me!

21:02.095 --> 21:03.084
Help me!

21:03.972 --> 21:04.961
- It's okay.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.089
You're okay.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.269
Go get some rest.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.933
She is not taking it well.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.934
Oh, our first cop.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.185
I'm Morgan.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.233
I give the talk
to the newcomers.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.776
Come on.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.070
I'll make it quick.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.148
We don't eat.
We don't sleep.

21:24.242 --> 21:27.029
We don't get old.
You are dead.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.782
And you're gonna
do a lot of walking.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.363
- I just need to find a way
to talk to--

21:31.458 --> 21:32.447
- The living?

21:33.585 --> 21:35.325
You can't talk to the living.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.830
- What, are you
some kind of expert?

21:36.921 --> 21:39.503
- No, just been a ghost longer
than anyone else around here,

21:39.591 --> 21:41.297
almost two years now.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.624
- Haven, of all places,

21:42.719 --> 21:43.959
should be full of dead people,

21:44.053 --> 21:46.544
so where's everybody else?

21:46.639 --> 21:47.799
- They moved on.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.553
We figure we're
the ones with work to do.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.759
There's a dozen of us,
that we know of.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.469
- I don't believe we're dead.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.475
- Good thing proof
is part of the tour.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.275
- So that's you?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.436
- Cancer.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.740
You can feel it at the end,
you know.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.319
So I went for a swim
at the beach by my place.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.872
Died out there.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.164
Like you just did.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.291
- If you died out there,
then...

22:25.303 --> 22:26.793
where's your bathing suit.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.085
- Well, the theory is,

22:28.181 --> 22:31.844
we're residual self-images
from our last happiest moment,

22:31.935 --> 22:33.721
usually with someone you love.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.178
Howl looked
at my last birthday.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.728
You were... at work?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.775
With someone you care about?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.479
- If I'm really dead, then how
can I help Audrey?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.781
- I tried for years
to reach out to my fiancée.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.074
I tried everything.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.736
There is no way.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.534
Maybe that's our problem.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.867
Maybe for us to move on,
we need to finally let them go.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.380
- My dad's ghost happened here.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.971
Chief.
You all right?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.843
- Why don't you get blown
into a thousand pieces

23:12.934 --> 23:14.424
and tell me how you feel?

23:14.519 --> 23:16.350
How are things?
How are you doing?

23:16.437 --> 23:18.223
- I'm talking to my dead dad
in the graveyard.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.607
It happened
here-- It was a Trouble

23:22.694 --> 23:25.231
that let the dead talk
to the living.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.312
Duke killed that guy,

23:27.407 --> 23:28.817
so he's got it now.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.240
- Should I be following
any of this?

23:31.744 --> 23:34.531
- If Duke has a Trouble
that can talk to the dead,

23:34.622 --> 23:36.999
then I can talk to Audrey.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.163
- Say good-bye?

23:38.251 --> 23:39.832
- Say hello.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.669
(birds calling, waves lapping)

23:47.760 --> 23:48.749
(loud bubbling)

23:52.432 --> 23:53.547
Your family journal--
Good.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.593
Forget what did this to me.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.268
Think.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.186
The gravedigger's Trouble
that's in there.

24:04.694 --> 24:05.683
Slow down, slow down.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.813
Don't--
(book thuds)

24:08.114 --> 24:09.103
(sighs heavily)

24:13.578 --> 24:14.818
- Yeah.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.946
(exhales)

24:20.960 --> 24:22.621
- Right, 'cause that's
gonna make you smarter.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.716
And I just keep on truckin'.

24:29.802 --> 24:33.090
In the end, it's just gonna be
you and me, Mr. Battistone.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.306
You, me...

24:38.603 --> 24:40.810
and the crazy lady
down in the hold.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.810
- Nathan's dead?

24:50.907 --> 24:53.239
Well, who's gonna bore
the hell out of me now?

24:53.326 --> 24:55.533
- Thanks.
Duke: Give yourself some credit.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.406
You invented the Trouble
that did it.

24:57.497 --> 25:00.159
Some kind of
incineration Trouble,

25:00.249 --> 25:02.240
leaves behind a burn imprint.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.871
-Hmm.
- Hard to forget that one.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.701
I don't care how long ago
you made it.

25:05.797 --> 25:06.786
- Oh.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.916
Now, you're not as dumb
as you look.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.250
Trying to get me to open up

25:12.345 --> 25:14.176
by appealing to my vanity.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.057
It's not gonna work.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.348
I told you,
we're not doing this.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.810
- You know what Trouble this is.

25:22.897 --> 25:23.977
And you are gonna tell me

25:24.065 --> 25:26.101
so I can catch the bastard
who did it.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.104
- Now, Duke,
don't get too upset.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.603
You don't want to blow a gasket

25:31.698 --> 25:33.529
and bleed out
all over the floor.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.660
Does this mean I don't get
my lunch?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.197
(door closes)

25:45.503 --> 25:48.040
(groans)
- I wish you could hear me, you bitch.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.421
- Now, is that any way to speak

25:50.508 --> 25:53.215
to the only person
who can see you?

25:53.302 --> 25:56.385
J‘J‘

25:58.725 --> 25:59.714
(bird calls)

26:01.144 --> 26:02.350
- You can see me.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.098
- Don't look so surprised.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.689
- You're immune to Troubles.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.890
So that means I'm--

26:09.902 --> 26:12.393
I'm not really a ghost.
I'm alive.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.321
I'm just the victim
of someone's Trouble.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.397
- Whose?
- Please.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.613
Don't do that.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.786
- Why-why can't I touch you?

26:21.873 --> 26:23.829
- So many questions.
You better stop.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.702
You might hurt
yourself, detective.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.294
- How does it work?

26:27.378 --> 26:28.413
- I don't know.
- No.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.369
You're gonna help me
figure this out.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.454
- Me help you?

26:31.549 --> 26:33.961
No, that's never going to happen.
(door opening)

26:36.179 --> 26:37.294
- Who the hell
are you talking to?

26:37.388 --> 26:38.889
- Tell him I'm here, Mara.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.759
- I'm just so lonely.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.681
Can't a girl talk to herself?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.680
- Tell him I'm here!
- Duke, would you be a doll

26:44.771 --> 26:46.932
and hit the lights
on the way out?

26:47.023 --> 26:48.479
- You really are starting
to lose it down here.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.227
- Thank you, appreciate it.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.110
- Fine. I'm gonna find a way
to talk to Audrey.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.027
We're gonna fix this.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.281
I don't need you.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.628
- Mara says she doesn't
know anything about the Trouble.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.043
- You shouldn't have bothered.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.121
We'd be better off without her.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.207
I've got eyes on our suspect.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.916
He's tailing me,
along with Mitchell.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.377
- You mean the man with
the incineration Trouble?

27:19.472 --> 27:20.712
That suspect?

27:20.807 --> 27:21.842
Audrey, listen to me.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.298
Get out of there, now.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.553
- Can't do that, Duke.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.681
- You used yourself as bait.

27:27.772 --> 27:30.138
Audrey, you're not
immune anymore.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.393
Don't do this.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.226
J‘J‘

27:44.956 --> 27:45.945
(Mitchell sighing)

27:46.749 --> 27:47.738
- Damn it.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.990
You go that way...
I'll call the others.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.255
- On your knees.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.381
Hands on your head now.

28:01.472 --> 28:02.757
Down.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.725
(indistinct talking)

28:11.816 --> 28:13.101
- Guys.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.683
Good news.
We're not dead.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.063
We've been trapped this way
like ghosts

28:17.154 --> 28:18.940
by someone's curse, a Trouble.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.230
- What are you talking about?

28:22.535 --> 28:24.446
when you think you died,

28:24.537 --> 28:26.368
did you see
a big flash of light?

28:26.455 --> 28:27.581
- Yeah, it was headlights.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.326
- No, it wasn't headlights.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.624
It was whatever did this to us.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.292
You became a ghost
after you saw it.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.461
- That's what caused the crash.
- All right, enough.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.539
- They never found
your body, right?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.582
Should have washed up somewhere.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.963
And yours, it would have been in
that mangled, burned-up car,

28:42.054 --> 28:44.215
but they didn't
find it, did they?

28:44.307 --> 28:46.514
I bet they never found the bodies
of the others either...

28:48.060 --> 28:49.641
Because we didn't die...

28:50.813 --> 28:52.769
- We just disappeared.
- What's it matter?

28:52.857 --> 28:54.768
- We're still stuck this way.
- Not forever.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.440
Not if we can figure this out,

28:56.527 --> 28:59.360
solve this Trouble.
I've done it before.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.483
That could send us back
to real life, all of us.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.314
- Who do you think you are?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.741
There's one thing
that keeps you sane around here.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.819
It's not hoping to go back!

29:09.832 --> 29:12.244
- If I'm right,
I'm gonna need your help.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.127
Don't you think you owe that
to the people who love you?

29:18.174 --> 29:19.163
- I'm in.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.589
- Okay, track down the others.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.632
Find out how they think
they died.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.676
If there's a
pattern, it could help us.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.846
We'll meet back here later,
see what we've learned.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.298
Morgan?

29:30.478 --> 29:33.686
- Even if we do find something,
what does it matter?

29:33.773 --> 29:36.731
We can't communicate
with the living anyway.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.978
- Let me worry about that.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.560
Might have figured out a way.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.361
l have to go see
what my partner's learned.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.530
She might have a lead on the Troubled
person already.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.526
- You will talk.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.781
Your incineration Trouble...

29:51.082 --> 29:52.868
Can you undo it?

29:52.959 --> 29:54.039
(exhales defiantly)

29:54.126 --> 29:55.115
Tell me.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.088
- That ain't my Trouble.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.295
I know who I am.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.544
You know who you are?

30:02.635 --> 30:05.798
You used to be one
who helped people like me.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.389
But we know the truth now,
don't we?

30:07.473 --> 30:08.758
- You don't
know a thing about me.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.134
- We protect this town,

30:10.226 --> 30:11.386
and if you won't fix it,

30:11.477 --> 30:14.059
then maybe Haven needs
protecting from you.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.386
(whooshing)

30:16.399 --> 30:17.388
(gasps)

30:20.152 --> 30:25.021
J‘J‘

30:25.116 --> 30:26.606
- What did you do?

30:28.369 --> 30:29.575
I knew it.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.318
MEIR

30:36.252 --> 30:37.241
J‘J‘

30:41.924 --> 30:44.290
(tires squealing)
- Hey, hey!

30:45.261 --> 30:47.001
Audrey!

30:51.225 --> 30:55.559
J‘J‘

31:06.949 --> 31:09.691
(beeping)

31:13.539 --> 31:16.531
(cell phone buzzing)

31:22.590 --> 31:23.579
- Deal's off, Duke.

31:24.592 --> 31:25.832
She killed Reggie.

31:26.927 --> 31:27.916
(thuds)

31:28.846 --> 31:30.837
(shatters)

31:30.931 --> 31:32.717
- Just let me go.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.299
I can make this all go away.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.804
- I'm a cop.
- This little Audrey act

31:36.896 --> 31:38.887
fooled your friends, but not me,
not this time.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.391
- I am not Mara, all right?

31:40.483 --> 31:41.472
Just--

31:43.235 --> 31:45.726
- What do you want, Mitchell?
- We want you to fix us.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.027
- Mara couldn't cure
the Troubles

31:47.114 --> 31:48.945
- and neither can I.
- But you can change them

31:49.033 --> 31:50.773
like you did for Jody
out at the cabin.

31:50.868 --> 31:53.484
- That wasn't me, all right?
I don't know how she--

31:53.579 --> 31:56.161
- Do you have any idea
what it's like to be Troubled?

31:56.248 --> 32:00.036
Bishop here, anything he touches
dissolves in a heartbeat.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.788
He held his wife's hands.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.838
We are killing machines
because of you,

32:06.926 --> 32:08.666
and we're barely hanging on.

32:08.761 --> 32:09.750
You can't cure us?

32:09.845 --> 32:11.346
Fine, but you can fix us.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.216
You can make our Troubles
easier to live with.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.013
And you will,
even if we have to force you.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.517
Nobody's coming
to help you, Mara.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.221
We'll give you some time
to think it over.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.897
We'll let you decide.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.281
- I can't get you out of here.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.491
Maybe there's someone who can.

32:46.841 --> 32:47.830
(bubbling)

32:50.636 --> 32:53.093
- Oh, the great
detective returns.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.671
Still haven't changed my mind.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.631
- I need to talk to Duke.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.057
The guard took Audrey.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.134
They think she's you.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.469
- And I should care why?

33:01.564 --> 33:02.849
- You don't know
what'll happen to you

33:02.940 --> 33:04.726
if they kill her.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.808
So don't help us.
Help yourself.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.809
- All right, so you're saying

33:08.904 --> 33:11.816
that if we are connected,

33:11.907 --> 33:13.192
I could be killed.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.200
That's a gamble
I'm willing to take.

33:16.287 --> 33:18.073
Would you tell her
I said bye?

33:18.164 --> 33:19.370
Thank you.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.662
- I just heard that the guard
has Audrey somewhere.

33:28.966 --> 33:31.753
I am not gonna lose her
and Nathan in the same day.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.050
- It's such a shame.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.134
It's too bad we can't
do anything about it.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.339
- That's where you're wrong.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.345
You see, I am going
to trade Audrey

33:40.436 --> 33:42.848
for what they really want,

33:42.938 --> 33:45.520
what they don't
even know exists...

33:45.608 --> 33:46.597
you.

33:46.692 --> 33:47.681
- Well, that's a plan.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.765
- Please.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.943
You won't let them kill me.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.941
We could be connected.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.772
You still don't know.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.403
- I guess we're
about to find out.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.905
You see, if I do nothing,

33:58.996 --> 34:00.202
they kill her.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.617
I turn you over,

34:02.708 --> 34:05.450
well, at least there's a chance
that Audrey lives.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.455
- How do you like that?

34:07.546 --> 34:08.661
He's a gambler, too.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.246
- You won't do it.

34:11.383 --> 34:15.092
You need me to control
whatever's going on with you.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.969
We both know that.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.046
Duke: Right.

34:20.434 --> 34:21.935
I do need you.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.388
But right now...

34:25.522 --> 34:27.137
I could care less.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.515
(chains rattling)

34:32.071 --> 34:33.527
(lock clicks)

34:33.614 --> 34:34.649
- It's over, Mara.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.730
HoW's it feel?

34:36.825 --> 34:37.985
- Would you just shut up?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.072
- Uh...

34:46.752 --> 34:49.084
Who the hell
are you talking to?

34:49.463 --> 34:50.669
- Oh, you know...

34:51.674 --> 34:54.165
your boyfriend.

34:56.595 --> 34:57.584
(Duke chuckles)

34:59.807 --> 35:01.263
- Nice try.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.965
You almost had me going there
for a second.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.766
- Looks like he's
gonna need some proof.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.514
- Oh, wow,
you really are just...

35:06.605 --> 35:07.594
(whistles)
Huh?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.520
- Tell him he said
it would just be him

35:09.608 --> 35:11.769
and his scotch Battistone
in the end.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.352
- Apparently, it's gonna be
just you and your Battistone

35:15.447 --> 35:16.607
in the end.

35:18.242 --> 35:20.233
You've started talking
to your scotch?

35:20.703 --> 35:21.818
(whistles)

35:28.252 --> 35:29.458
- You heard me.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.747
- Oh, come on, Duke.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.545
You know your boat.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.168
You knowl couldn't
have heard you.

35:35.259 --> 35:36.499
- And he threw his journal.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.208
- Oh, and then you
threw your journal.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.721
- There's no way
you could have seen me.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.968
Nathan was there?

35:44.310 --> 35:46.175
- Mm.
- And he's alive?

35:46.270 --> 35:47.931
- Mm.
- How?

35:48.022 --> 35:49.808
Is he here right now?

35:50.399 --> 35:51.388
Nathan?

35:52.443 --> 35:53.979
Nathan, I'm sorry, we'll have
to have a séance later.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.229
Look.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.733
You ask him,
does he know where Audrey is?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.405
- He's her lap dog.
What do you think?

36:00.492 --> 36:04.201
- Mara, if you do not help us
get Audrey back...

36:04.288 --> 36:08.031
I swear, I will
give you to the Guard.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.539
- Time's up, Mara.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.597
Audrey: What are you doing?

36:25.684 --> 36:26.890
- I know you have
to put a hand on us

36:26.977 --> 36:28.308
to change our Troubles.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.976
We're just gonna help you do it.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.804
Bishop, you're up first.

36:34.485 --> 36:35.474
Audrey: Wha--

36:36.362 --> 36:37.351
(crumbling)

36:39.323 --> 36:40.938
Mitchell: Now put a hand on him
and fix him.

36:43.577 --> 36:44.612
It's a good thing
you're immune to Troubles,

36:44.703 --> 36:45.818
or this could get ugly, huh?

36:45.913 --> 36:47.619
- Please, no, you don't know
what you're doing.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.947
(beeping)
Bishop: Who's that?

36:51.377 --> 36:54.710
J‘J‘

36:54.797 --> 36:55.786
- Wow.

36:56.006 --> 36:57.507
Now, if I threw a party,

36:57.591 --> 36:59.502
I would invite you, and that's
what hurts my feelings.

37:00.636 --> 37:01.625
(crumbling)

37:06.809 --> 37:08.720
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.976
- You want to arrest them or
you just want me to shoot them?

37:12.064 --> 37:13.270
- Let them go.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.479
- Audrey, they tried
to kill you.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.555
- I know.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.775
But I'm gonna prove to them
that they're wrong.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.363
I am Audrey Parker.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.229
- HoW'd you know about
this place?

37:22.324 --> 37:23.313
HoW'd you get in here?

37:23.409 --> 37:25.570
- I'm a psychic friend now.
It's one of my new Troubles.

37:25.661 --> 37:26.901
- I heard you can't
control them.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.030
- Well, Mitchell...

37:29.373 --> 37:31.830
You come after me
and my friends again...

37:31.917 --> 37:33.532
you're gonna find out.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.585
(footsteps retreating)

37:40.676 --> 37:42.166
(waves lapping, birds calling)

37:43.762 --> 37:44.751
(squeaking)

37:50.477 --> 37:51.978
(can thuds)
Get comfortable.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.519
You're staying here.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.521
Dwight or no Dwight,
you're not going to the Guard,

37:56.608 --> 37:58.599
not until I figure out if you're
connected to Audrey.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.608
What are you doing?

38:07.703 --> 38:09.193
(straining)
- Proving a point.

38:10.247 --> 38:11.453
- And that is?

38:13.417 --> 38:15.123
- Go find Audrey.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.325
She's fine.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.626
We're not connected.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.295
We never were.

38:21.592 --> 38:22.581
- Why are you telling me this?

38:22.676 --> 38:24.837
- Because it doesn't
matter anymore.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.970
You guys need
me for my immunity.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.556
You won't get rid of me.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.429
I'm the only one
that can speak with Nathan.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.679
- We will get rid of you.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.479
If you don't help us
get Nathan back--

38:38.567 --> 38:39.556
- And we're back.

38:40.569 --> 38:44.903
I'll help you, but only
if you give me something first.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.230
I'm all you've got.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.862
- Yeah, we're done.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.694
- Is that the only reason
why I'm staying, Duke?

38:53.665 --> 38:56.498
What was it
that you admitted earlier?

38:56.585 --> 38:57.574
Oh, right.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.873
You need me.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.750
- You must have misheard me.

39:04.301 --> 39:06.041
- No, I liked
whatl heard, Duke.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.309
- Good luck with that.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.349
(door squeaks)
- Why do I even try?

39:19.399 --> 39:20.900
(door closes)

39:20.984 --> 39:22.394
Duke: So you're really
not connected then.

39:22.486 --> 39:25.478
- No, Duke, my wrist,
it's completely fine.

39:26.949 --> 39:27.938
But, you know, this could mean

39:28.033 --> 39:29.443
that Mara is getting
more dangerous,

39:29.535 --> 39:31.491
so, please, just be careful.

39:33.622 --> 39:34.611
(phone clicks)

39:35.958 --> 39:40.952
J‘J‘

39:43.549 --> 39:48.885
So, Nathan, just gonna hope
that you're standing here.

39:52.516 --> 39:53.722
- This is strange.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.382
Even for us.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.513
- I don't even know
where to start.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.980
The police station, I guess.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.305
Everybody there is
pretty weirded out by me,

40:03.902 --> 40:06.439
that they're gonna have
to just get used to it.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.395
- Just wait till they find out
I'm still alive.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.903
- And I agreed
to keep Mara around.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.443
I hate to say it, but...

40:15.539 --> 40:16.745
we need her.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.790
You know, it's...

40:20.460 --> 40:21.449
it's funny.

40:22.796 --> 40:25.458
I used to not know who I was.

40:26.592 --> 40:27.581
I knew what I did.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.916
I helped Troubled people,

40:29.011 --> 40:33.095
but now... I'm just... me.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.848
I'm not one
of Mara's... personalities.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.094
But I don't have her immunity.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.481
I don't even know
if you're here right now.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.279
- I'm here.

40:51.408 --> 40:55.447
- At least if I was her,
I would be able to see you.

40:55.537 --> 40:57.038
You saved me, Nathan.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.416
I'm just really afraid I'm not
gonna be able to save you.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.003
- Don't be afraid, Parker.

41:05.130 --> 41:09.089
I've got friends helping me
work the case from my side.

41:09.176 --> 41:11.383
I have to go meet them now.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.676
But I'm safe here.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.971
And I will come back.

41:16.058 --> 41:17.298
I promise.

41:30.572 --> 41:31.812
Morgan?

41:34.201 --> 41:35.190
Glen?

41:36.328 --> 41:37.659
Guys?

41:37.746 --> 41:39.361
I'm here.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.998
J‘J‘

41:56.348 --> 41:58.339
J‘J‘

42:00.519 --> 42:05.058
J‘J‘
