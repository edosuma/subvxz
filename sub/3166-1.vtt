00:49.300 --> 00:53.748
Massachusetts colony, october in 1666.
22 people die in a mysterious way.

00:53.940 --> 00:57.738
A slave was guilty of witchcraft
and burned at the stake.

00:57.939 --> 01:01.307
The truth about their death
has been kept secret by the villagers,

01:01.497 --> 01:05.263
And was unknown to the outside world
for several centuries.

02:31.688 --> 02:34.419
- Hey, Jess.
- What do you think?

02:34.609 --> 02:38.656
I've thought a lot about what you said.

02:38.847 --> 02:43.488
Can not you give me a second chance?

02:43.686 --> 02:47.247
We have already talked about it.
You can not.

02:47.447 --> 02:52.372
I know, but this I believe.

02:52.565 --> 02:56.537
- This may be the right thing.
- I can not. I must stop.

02:56.725 --> 03:00.410
Please do not do this.

03:56.518 --> 04:03.321
- Who are you?
- Greg. Your new roommate.

04:04.637 --> 04:08.562
Mary rented the other room
to me.

04:08.757 --> 04:14.445
Mary said something about it, but I thought
it was a few weeks.

04:14.636 --> 04:19.926
It was meant,
but Max girlfriend threw me out.

04:20.115 --> 04:23.881
That's why I came here earlier.

04:24.075 --> 04:28.478
- Mary said it went well.
- Sure. Make yourself at home.

04:28.673 --> 04:32.759
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you. I'll do that.

04:34.674 --> 04:40.077
- I have to take out some boxes.
-I got it.

04:40.272 --> 04:43.993
- Thank you.
- What's your name anyway?

04:44.192 --> 04:49.961
- Sorry. Rachel.
- Nice to meet you.

04:50.152 --> 04:54.236
- I'll try to keep it clean.
- Awesome.

04:55.471 --> 04:59.395
'Show me where the boxes are.

05:01.310 --> 05:03.995
Okay-

05:06.470 --> 05:12.238
- Where are you from?
- New York. Upstate.

05:14.029 --> 05:18.830
- Self, then?
- A small town on The Cape.

05:19.028 --> 05:23.556
- The Cape?
- Sorry. Cape Cod.

05:23.749 --> 05:29.355
- Do you have lead in cartons?
-A girl has to work.

05:29.548 --> 05:32.756
- Today's training.
- Thanks for the help.

05:32.947 --> 05:38.590
- I hope it works.
- What?

05:39.906 --> 05:46.072
I'm working on an article. Mary said
that there would be problems.

05:46.265 --> 05:51.749
I promise not to bother you.
I'm easy to get along with.

05:51.944 --> 05:56.268
- Sorry. It sounded unpleasant.
- I can not offend.

05:56.464 --> 06:00.264
- Okay. Thank you.
- Here

06:12.382 --> 06:16.626
Today we will talk about
witch trial in Salem.

06:16.822 --> 06:20.792
It happened here, in our city.

06:44.139 --> 06:48.348
Why were all killed people?

06:48.538 --> 06:51.620
Does it happen still?

06:57.297 --> 07:02.541
- Are you sure you want to do that?
- This is what I've been waiting for.

07:02.736 --> 07:08.061
Do not worry.
I'll be fine, Mom.

09:09.241 --> 09:14.724
- Thanks again for the help.
-Not at all.

09:16.240 --> 09:22.121
- What are your plans for today?
- I'm tired and should get some rest.

09:22.319 --> 09:28.282
- The drive was tiring.
- I'm going away. See you later.

09:28.479 --> 09:33.439
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Bye.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.678
- Yes?
- My name is Rachel.

10:18.873 --> 10:21.638
How can I help you?

10:21.832 --> 10:24.961
I have heard
you can tell us about the resort.

10:25.152 --> 10:27.757
Sure. Come in.

10:34.912 --> 10:38.279
What would you like to know?

10:38.471 --> 10:42.556
Anything you can tell us about the area.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.233
First I want to warn you
for some things.

10:46.431 --> 10:48.830
What?

10:49.029 --> 10:55.435
Many locals do not like strangers.
We do not like change.

10:55.629 --> 11:00.111
The families who founded the village still live
and we are almost self-sufficient.

11:00.309 --> 11:04.074
We do not like them
that threaten our independence.

11:04.267 --> 11:07.077
They do not like journalists-

11:07.267 --> 11:12.433
Or to talk about mj?ldryge-
poisoning or witch trial.

11:12.627 --> 11:18.589
They are sick of the Past
and no one will talk about it.

11:18.785 --> 11:22.392
If you try it's best
that you go from here.

11:22.585 --> 11:27.068
- What do you mean?
- You would soar in mortal danger.

11:28.665 --> 11:34.307
- Why are you talking to me, then?
- There's a reason for that.

11:34.505 --> 11:38.145
I risk my position in society.

11:38.344 --> 11:42.109
But I do not want to talk about it right now.
Hope you understand.

11:42.304 --> 11:48.470
- My name may not be mentioned in the article.
- Self-Klan not. You may remain anonymous.

11:55.062 --> 12:01.024
What can you tell us about
ergot poisoning?

12:01.221 --> 12:05.909
It is a fungus that attacks
rye, wheat and other grains.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.502
When eating fungus infested
legumes damage-

12:09.701 --> 12:15.184
-Central nervous system,
arteries, veins and other organs.

12:15.379 --> 12:18.542
It fits with my research.

12:18.739 --> 12:22.711
What can you tell us about
ergot poisoning in the resort?

12:22.899 --> 12:27.826
It has been more than one outbreak
in the art.

12:28.019 --> 12:31.943
There have been big and small outburst
and has happened in many years.

12:32.138 --> 12:37.349
- Do you know how many people have died?
- It depends on the outbreak it was.

12:37.537 --> 12:42.622
It's been all between 10 and 100.

12:42.815 --> 12:45.341
Oh my God.

12:45.537 --> 12:49.665
This is the largest number of deaths
I've heard of.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.780
We are not proud of.

12:52.974 --> 12:56.775
That's why I warned
whom you talk to.

12:56.975 --> 13:00.421
Do police and authorities
about this?

13:00.614 --> 13:05.176
Are you kidding me?
Have you seen any cops here?

13:05.374 --> 13:10.459
We turn to the authorities.
We take care of ourselves.

13:13.774 --> 13:18.380
Are there any physical evidence of
an outbreak that I can see?

13:18.573 --> 13:23.021
Yes, but you must be
very careful.

13:23.212 --> 13:28.378
There is a secret cemetery
where mass burials have taken place.

13:28.572 --> 13:34.452
You can visit the site,
but you must be careful.

13:34.649 --> 13:40.180
You are in danger of locals
find out what you're doing.

13:40.369 --> 13:45.899
- Are local people really so dangerous?
- So Dangerous?

13:47.089 --> 13:49.410
Yes.

13:53.608 --> 13:57.612
Is there something else I should focus on?

13:57.807 --> 14:01.016
There are a few other things
that can help.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.974
I'll give you a map
and some articles.

14:08.526 --> 14:11.005
Who is it?

14:12.565 --> 14:16.365
- What do you mean?
- There was someone there just now. I promise.

14:17.565 --> 14:21.172
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:22.205 --> 14:26.733
You should go home. I'll contact you
when we can meet again.

14:26.924 --> 14:28.925
You have to go now.

14:30.643 --> 14:34.968
- Is there a problem?
-You should go before it gets too late.

15:16.358 --> 15:19.726
STOP DIGGING IN THE PAST.
GO HERE!

16:14.351 --> 16:17.560
. Hi
. Hi-

16:19.111 --> 16:23.639
- How was your day?
- Pretty good.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.553
- What are you doing?
- I emailed.

16:29.749 --> 16:34.551
- I have not much time.
- I'll let you continue.

16:34.749 --> 16:37.672
No problem.

16:37.870 --> 16:41.475
See you later. All right.

17:07.866 --> 17:10.867
Sorry.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.228
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- About what?

17:14.424 --> 17:19.464
I am new to the area
and are interested in local history.

17:19.664 --> 17:24.954
- I have heard of ergot poisoning.
- That I do not talk about.

17:54.860 --> 18:02.026
I should probably tell you that it sat
a note on the door yesterday.

18:02.220 --> 18:05.267
What did it say?

18:05.458 --> 18:09.066
Something that I should stop digging
in the past.

18:09.258 --> 18:12.500
And that I should go from here.

18:12.697 --> 18:15.667
What does that mean?

18:15.857 --> 18:18.462
Locals know enough
I'm a journalist.

18:18.657 --> 18:22.819
They may know that you are also here.

18:23.016 --> 18:27.305
- Mary might have said something.
- Yes.

18:27.495 --> 18:33.218
Lokalben Paul told us that locals
not proud of his past-

18:33.415 --> 18:39.535
And does not want to talk about it, but
I think they are trying to hide something.

18:39.735 --> 18:43.784
- Interesting
- Yes.

18:44.975 --> 18:50.696
I'll be careful who I'm talking
with because they do not like strangers.

18:50.894 --> 18:54.213
Then we have to be careful
who we are talking to.

18:57.932 --> 19:01.573
Sure. There is no problem.

19:01.772 --> 19:04.981
I'll take a walk.
Want to join us?

19:59.485 --> 20:05.127
- It's amazing.
- It's nice.

20:05.324 --> 20:08.408
Really cool.

20:08.604 --> 20:14.053
- It's a good place to consider.
- I can imagine.

20:16.242 --> 20:21.966
Say, Greg. Why are you here?

20:22.163 --> 20:29.090
- For the same reason as me?
- Type, but I'm not a journalist.

20:31.401 --> 20:34.450
Awesome.

20:34.641 --> 20:40.681
- What are you doing?
- I am a writer.

20:40.880 --> 20:48.367
- Cool. Have something screenplay filmed?
-I can not say.

20:48.561 --> 20:53.962
- Some anonymous independent films.
- You have to start somewhere.

20:54.159 --> 20:58.208
This place might
get the fuck on our careers.

20:58.399 --> 21:00.479
Maybe.

21:00.677 --> 21:06.240
You write the article and I
writes the screenplay that makes success.

21:06.436 --> 21:12.398
- It sounds like a movie in itself.
- I am good at my job.

21:22.194 --> 21:26.280
Sorry. Hello.

21:26.475 --> 21:31.242
- We wonder ...
- I do not wanna talk about it.

21:31.434 --> 21:36.473
- It only takes a few seconds.
- Leave me alone and get out.

21:42.993 --> 21:48.841
- It was weird.
- So it has been in recent weeks.

21:50.032 --> 21:53.160
Paul is the only
who wants to talk to me.

23:04.743 --> 23:08.269
I'm being followed.
I can not tell you everything now.

23:08.463 --> 23:12.752
- Here are answers to many questions.
- Who is following you?

23:12.943 --> 23:16.185
- I do not have time to explain.
- Thank you.

23:16.383 --> 23:21.308
We can not meet at my place.
I'll contact you.

23:21.501 --> 23:26.347
Do not trust anyone. including ...

23:31.181 --> 23:33.182
I must go. We heard.

24:36.653 --> 24:42.056
Hey, Max. Good news.

24:42.253 --> 24:47.702
- Save the front page for me.
- What do you think?

24:47.893 --> 24:52.692
I'll send pictures now.
Check your email.

24:52.891 --> 25:00.138
- Good. Do you have permission?
- You will soon have the whole story.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.297
We heard.

25:11.088 --> 25:14.171
DIED Oct. 11, 1999

25:14.367 --> 25:16.495
DIED Oct. 11, 1999

28:12.507 --> 28:16.032
What do you do? Get out!

28:16.226 --> 28:19.753
Are you okay? Hello?

28:21.065 --> 28:26.789
- Sorry. What did you say?
- I wanted to check if you feel well.

28:26.985 --> 28:31.354
- Sure. I'm waiting for a call.
- From who?

28:33.065 --> 28:37.673
- Paul.
- Right-Paul.

28:41.343 --> 28:46.349
- I'm going home to him.
- Should I go with you?

28:56.262 --> 28:59.583
You get the credit.

29:47.575 --> 29:52.375
- Are you okay?
- We must here.

30:04.894 --> 30:08.784
There is something really fishy here.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.580
What did you see in the house?

30:20.292 --> 30:22.612
Paul?

30:27.932 --> 30:32.413
He was sitting dead in his chair. And then ...

30:33.571 --> 30:37.858
I saw locals with black hoods
who performed some sort of ritual.

30:38.050 --> 30:40.974
Seriously?

30:41.170 --> 30:45.971
They held candles in their hands and looked
as if it would do anything.

30:46.170 --> 30:52.778
- They freaked out when they saw me.
-Take it easy. WE solve this.

30:54.968 --> 30:57.857
Are you okay?

31:04.047 --> 31:10.247
- Are you going to tell me what happened?
-There is something really fishy here.

31:10.446 --> 31:14.211
What did you see in the house?

31:14.405 --> 31:16.808
I'll be right.

33:46.547 --> 33:50.233
Rachel, I'm Jim
and is Paul's friend.

33:50.428 --> 33:54.512
He asked me to give you this.

33:54.707 --> 34:01.590
Be careful.
You are in grave danger. Do not trust anyone.

34:34.342 --> 34:39.428
- What do you think?
- So you work here now?

34:50.940 --> 34:55.980
- Who was that?
- I do not know. It is weird.

34:56.179 --> 35:01.550
- I think he's been following me.
- Good thing I'm here to protect you.

35:01.739 --> 35:06.266
I'm really strong.
I'm just joking. So strong is not.

35:06.459 --> 35:10.543
- Want some coffee?
- Please.

35:26.257 --> 35:29.226
It's not for the money.

35:29.416 --> 35:35.377
I am trying to make contact with the locals.

35:35.574 --> 35:38.385
Very smart.

35:47.454 --> 35:50.138
Are you sure you're okay?

35:55.933 --> 36:00.415
Yes. That I will do.

36:00.612 --> 36:07.337
- Okay. See you at home.
- Okay.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.778
What do you want?

36:51.966 --> 36:57.369
- I wonder if I can ask if ...
- Who is it?

36:57.565 --> 37:00.410
Let me fix it.

37:00.606 --> 37:04.496
- Can we talk about ...
- Come in.

38:00.158 --> 38:05.449
Hi, I have received more information.

38:05.638 --> 38:09.722
20 people died in the same week
in October 2010.

38:09.919 --> 38:14.638
But I do not know if it is of
ergot poisoning or something else.

38:14.837 --> 38:17.965
I need more time
to piece this together.

38:18.156 --> 38:23.195
I have been informed that some thing
will happen in a few weeks.

38:23.395 --> 38:29.083
- You only have a few days time.
- You get the article soon.

38:29.274 --> 38:34.279
- I'm sending Sam if needed.
- No, I can handle myself.

38:34.474 --> 38:38.717
- I tell if I need help.
- The item will be ready on the 29th

38:38.913 --> 38:41.359
I know that. Goodbye.

38:57.831 --> 39:00.995
Are you sure you're okay?

39:09.711 --> 39:14.192
Yes. That I will do.

39:31.827 --> 39:38.357
- Okay. See you at home.
- Okay.

40:11.023 --> 40:14.787
Why did you choose this location
to your script?

40:14.982 --> 40:18.385
I wanted a good story to film.

40:18.582 --> 40:23.225
I read an article about a city
which is completely self-sufficient.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.583
They are shielded
from the rest of the world.

40:26.781 --> 40:30.501
The film will be about a society where
residents turn against each other.

40:30.700 --> 40:33.351
They have their own government.

40:33.540 --> 40:39.990
They believe neither in sex, marriage
or to have children.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.467
Neither sex or marriage?

40:42.659 --> 40:47.620
- They probably died out.
- Bingo.

40:47.818 --> 40:50.867
There is certainly some
who practice it.

40:51.058 --> 40:55.699
I want to do thorough research-

40:55.897 --> 40:58.378
And write a really good script.

40:58.577 --> 41:02.262
Then maybe I can get back
my apartment.

41:02.456 --> 41:07.587
Apartment as your girlfriend
threw you out?

41:07.777 --> 41:10.666
Yes, that's right.

41:10.855 --> 41:16.225
- What happened between you and your girl?
- She does not understand my job.

41:16.416 --> 41:19.816
She wants to
I provide "a real job".

41:22.294 --> 41:27.504
She wants me to be something I'm
not. She sees me as a loser.

41:27.695 --> 41:31.699
She does not support me.

41:31.894 --> 41:35.295
I want to show that she's wrong.

41:35.493 --> 41:40.101
The only thing you need to prove anything to
is yourself.

41:50.692 --> 41:53.058
Greg?

42:25.248 --> 42:30.094
This is Greg. Leave a message
I will call.

42:30.287 --> 42:37.693
Greg, it's Rachel.
I was just wondering where you are.

42:37.886 --> 42:43.176
Call as soon as you get this. Goodbye.

43:28.240 --> 43:33.405
The first thing to look into is that it
has been more than an outbreak here.

43:33.599 --> 43:38.479
There have been both small and large
outbreaks. It has been going on for years.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.844
She's in there.

43:50.036 --> 43:54.121
WE should get her now,
before it becomes dangerous.

44:06.876 --> 44:12.519
- What do you know about ergot poisoning?
- I know quite a lot about it.

44:12.715 --> 44:15.479
I grew up in a town near Salem.

44:15.674 --> 44:19.679
In school, we learned much
the witch trials.

44:19.874 --> 44:25.562
We talked about that ergot may have
poisoned grains and arable land.

44:25.753 --> 44:33.352
And that the poisoning was the villagers
to believe that they were possessed.

44:33.552 --> 44:38.001
I became interested and have read
many books and done research.

44:38.192 --> 44:40.798
My essay was about it.

44:40.991 --> 44:45.279
When I graduated in
School of Journalism, I read-

44:45.471 --> 44:50.431
-About a city in western Massachusetts
who had many outbreaks for years.

44:50.630 --> 44:52.279
You have reached the right place.

45:18.227 --> 45:21.912
I'm obviously not here
to eat.

45:22.105 --> 45:25.076
We need to talk in private.

45:27.386 --> 45:30.549
What do you want?

45:30.744 --> 45:33.430
You probably know what I'm referring to.

45:35.944 --> 45:38.835
- We need to talk in private.
- About what?

45:45.704 --> 45:47.512
Greg?

47:08.734 --> 47:11.818
Is anybody there?

47:33.052 --> 47:36.817
It is time to sleep.
We read another book tomorrow.

47:37.011 --> 47:42.335
- Can you tell us about Salem witches?
- Where have you heard of it?

47:42.530 --> 47:45.817
- In school.
Really?

47:46.009 --> 47:48.740
I can not sleep.

47:48.929 --> 47:53.332
- Was anyone killed witches?
- Yes.

47:53.529 --> 47:59.535
- Has the witch trials today?
- Do not worry. We'll talk more tomorrow.

47:59.727 --> 48:03.527
- Good.
- Good night, sweetheart.

48:03.728 --> 48:06.048
Good night, Mom.

48:17.607 --> 48:22.486
- Leave me alone and get out.
- They are watching us. We'll talk later.

49:03.161 --> 49:05.481
Hello?

49:05.680 --> 49:09.525
Awesome. Thank you.

49:12.759 --> 49:15.285
I'm coming.

49:27.157 --> 49:29.889
I must go.

49:40.436 --> 49:45.283
She goes now. Follow her.

49:49.915 --> 49:56.160
Hi, Greg. It's Rachel.
I wonder where you are.

49:57.394 --> 50:02.684
Call me when you get this. Goodbye.

50:14.552 --> 50:17.999
- Followed someone after you get here?
- I do not think so.

50:18.192 --> 50:22.594
Good. Follow me.

51:05.586 --> 51:10.625
- What were the home of Paul?
- Tried to gather evidence.

51:10.826 --> 51:12.986
- They murdered him?
- Maybe.

51:13.184 --> 51:17.189
Why?

51:17.384 --> 51:20.867
Because he was talking to you.

51:23.943 --> 51:28.312
- I might turn.
- Why are you helping me, then?

51:28.504 --> 51:32.713
I need your help. My family
have lived herein many generations.

51:32.903 --> 51:37.624
When Lincoln prohibited claimed Slaveri
villagers that my ancestors-

51:37.822 --> 51:42.544
-Exerted Witchcraft and Voodoo,
which was not true.

51:42.742 --> 51:45.427
You are a journalist.

51:45.622 --> 51:52.345
You can exonerate my family's name
and reveal this secret city.

51:54.620 --> 51:58.023
It is an honor.

51:58.220 --> 52:01.267
I have to show you some things.

52:01.459 --> 52:05.703
There is significant evidence
for your claims.

55:07.798 --> 55:09.765
Stop!

55:27.436 --> 55:29.642
Stop!

55:32.596 --> 55:34.836
Rachel!

55:36.234 --> 55:38.201
We follow.

55:58.992 --> 56:01.039
Rachel.

56:05.151 --> 56:08.314
Rachel.

56:11.990 --> 56:15.358
- Open the door.
- I do not see her.

56:15.550 --> 56:21.875
Come out. We just want to talk.

56:22.068 --> 56:25.675
Open the door.

57:26.901 --> 57:29.791
- Max.
- Rachel.

57:29.982 --> 57:35.349
- The story just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
- What do you mean?

57:35.541 --> 57:41.342
- It's about more than poisoning.
- I do not understand. Explain.

57:41.540 --> 57:46.181
I stole a book from the cult where
is that they should kill with natural poison.

57:46.378 --> 57:50.144
I understand nothing.
What are you talking about?

57:50.339 --> 57:56.506
- The deaths is always in October.
- Calm down. We need proof.

57:56.697 --> 58:00.179
We need to stop it
before something terrible happens.

58:00.377 --> 58:03.665
The article is long overdue.

58:03.856 --> 58:07.907
Gather evidence.
I send down Sam to help you.

58:08.096 --> 58:11.623
There's more. I need more time.

58:11.816 --> 58:17.743
- We have no more time.
- I'll call you when I know more.

58:21.415 --> 58:23.985
There you have your evidence.

58:24.175 --> 58:30.180
They have about 50 locals in there
with their will.

58:30.375 --> 58:33.183
Why is that?

58:33.373 --> 58:38.935
According to locals, the bewitched
but they are poisoned and die soon.

58:39.132 --> 58:44.935
I wanted to show you the place,
but we go into when the time is right.

58:46.451 --> 58:50.137
We can not stay. We must go.

58:50.331 --> 58:52.334
Come on.

01:00:14.242 --> 01:00:18.166
It does not matter
where you go. I'll find you.

01:00:41.158 --> 01:00:44.208
You can not Hy.

01:01:45.071 --> 01:01:48.314
What are you doing?

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:57.994
You make a mistake.
You should not have slept here. Go home.

01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:02.877
There is no safer place
than your home.

01:02:32.866 --> 01:02:38.395
- What symptoms did people?
- All you can think of.

01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:43.147
Muscle spasms, hallucinations,
muscle-

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:47.315
-Shakes and gangrene.
And worse than that.

01:02:47.504 --> 01:02:51.349
- How bad?
- Some were like vegetables.

01:02:51.542 --> 01:02:54.786
And others died.

01:05:49.402 --> 01:05:54.533
Jason, it's something that is not true.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:03.250
Is there something going on in town
we do not know?

01:07:10.872 --> 01:07:13.035
Have you contacted all?

01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:17.123
I called my editor. He must
know what time we go to the house.

01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:23.478
Tell him we need many
police there tomorrow afternoon.

01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:28.676
I do not know. She's still talking.

01:08:22.904 --> 01:08:26.113
- What happened?
- A long history.

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:28.830
Tell us where you have been.

01:08:29.024 --> 01:08:33.984
My cell phone was left here. What has happened?

01:08:34.183 --> 01:08:39.223
You have no idea
what has happened in recent days.

01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.662
Come here.

01:08:41.861 --> 01:08:45.832
These are for you.

01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:08.139
I do not understand.

01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:13.868
Go up and take a hot shower.

01:09:14.059 --> 01:09:18.700
Put on something nice.
I'll buy you dinner.

01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:25.587
Okay-

01:09:25.778 --> 01:09:29.417
Then I have to tell you all
has happened.

01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:34.417
- We'll talk later.
- We must leave town.

01:09:34.616 --> 01:09:39.416
We can do this. Relax.
It'll work.

01:12:38.675 --> 01:12:43.601
- What are you doing?
- What's going on, Greg?

01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:47.195
- What gives?
- What do you mean?

01:12:47.394 --> 01:12:51.557
- I saw that you took the books.
- I do not know what you ...

01:12:51.753 --> 01:12:55.882
I saw that you took the books
and gave them to the man.

01:12:57.232 --> 01:13:01.157
- Listen to me.
- Get out.

01:13:01.352 --> 01:13:05.913
- Get out of here.
- Let go of me.

01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:08.078
Get out!

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:52.667
- Max.
- I'm glad you called.

01:13:52.865 --> 01:13:56.426
- It's crazy here.
- Good news. You get two more days.

01:13:56.626 --> 01:14:02.473
I do not trust anybody. Even the
my roommate trying to silence me.

01:14:02.664 --> 01:14:08.512
Be happy. You've got two more days.
Do not you get complete, Sam.

01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:12.186
Call the police before it is too late.

01:14:12.383 --> 01:14:18.469
- People are in grave danger!
- Calm down.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.586
Can you help me?

01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:24.103
I'll tell the police that you do not
trust your roommate?

01:14:24.301 --> 01:14:26.429
I must stop.

01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:45.773
I have more to show you. Come on.

01:16:12.328 --> 01:16:18.018
The test toxin on locals
in some sort of experiment.

01:16:59.604 --> 01:17:03.814
- Will all here?
- Yes.

01:17:04.004 --> 01:17:06.734
No other will come here.

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:11.246
- Why they do not move?
- They are afraid of them that control.

01:17:11.442 --> 01:17:18.370
- How long have they left?
-Not for long.

01:17:47.118 --> 01:17:54.205
- Max, are all prepared?
- Is that you Rachel? I hear nothing.

01:18:00.557 --> 01:18:06.404
- Are you prepared? We are inside the house.
- There are broken.

01:19:36.625 --> 01:19:40.107
I trusted you.

01:19:44.584 --> 01:19:47.235
No!

01:19:58.262 --> 01:20:00.913
Jim.

01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:05.668
Jim.

01:20:42.057 --> 01:20:44.901
This is the last one.

01:20:52.296 --> 01:20:57.745
- Thanks for the help.
- Here

01:20:57.935 --> 01:21:03.738
Hope it works out
and that you get home safely.

01:21:03.935 --> 01:21:07.541
- Do you have medicine for her?
-Not with me.

01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:13.423
We will contact Dr. Rush in New York.

01:21:13.614 --> 01:21:17.937
- It dissolves.
- You have my number if it's something.

01:21:18.134 --> 01:21:22.980
- Yes, I have.
- Bye.

01:22:10.848 --> 01:22:13.453
Hello?

01:22:15.366 --> 01:22:18.848
Hi there. Yes, we are.

01:22:49.242 --> 01:22:53.008
Rachel, when are you coming back?

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:55.932
Locals need you.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:24.247
Do not forget that Paul and I
always here and help you.

01:23:24.439 --> 01:23:30.366
Paul and I are always here
and help you.

01:23:39.196 --> 01:23:42.599
Thank you for calling. We heard.

01:23:54.476 --> 01:23:59.561
- Are you okay?
- That I will do.

01:24:07.993 --> 01:24:13.364
What can you tell us about
ergot poisoning?

01:24:14.713 --> 01:24:17.158
Why are you helping me?

01:24:19.592 --> 01:24:24.802
- Hello. My name is Greg.
- What do you want?

01:24:24.991 --> 01:24:30.031
Can I talk to you about Paul?

01:24:32.071 --> 01:24:35.074
I do not understand.

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.638
We were confused
when she broke into the house.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:44.359
When she was talking to herself
I understood that she was infected.

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:48.029
- Contaminated?
- Of ergot poisoning.

01:24:48.228 --> 01:24:51.278
She was hallucinating and paranoid.

01:24:51.468 --> 01:24:54.392
There have been many outbreaks here.

01:24:54.588 --> 01:24:58.797
- Can she be cured?
- We are trying to help her.

01:24:58.988 --> 01:25:02.434
Man I never get the opportunity
to talk to her.

01:25:02.626 --> 01:25:07.587
There is a specialist in New York
with medicine. Can you go there?

01:25:07.786 --> 01:25:11.108
Sure. I go there.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:16.436
- Keep your eyes on her in the meantime.
- Naturally
