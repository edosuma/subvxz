[Gossip Girl]
Gossip girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.440
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.268
Waiting for you in Tuscany
the first few days

00:07.355 --> 00:09.661
were mildlyhumiliating.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.142
But when I realized you weren't
gonna show, I rallied.

00:12.229 --> 00:15.493
[Blair]
Luckily, I made a friend
on the trip over.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.279
My name is actually
Marcus Beaton.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.846
I'm British and a Lord.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.152
[laughs]

00:22.239 --> 00:23.980
Please don't leave with him.

00:24.067 --> 00:24.981
[Blair]
You're telling me
you didn't have any fun

00:25.068 --> 00:26.939
with anyoneall summer?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.812
I don't think I'm ready.
I-I still miss Dan sometimes.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.162
[Dan]
Well, I've just been trying to
distract myself the best I can.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.251
I was hoping
when I saw you

00:34.338 --> 00:36.340
I would know that
we did the right thing.

00:36.427 --> 00:41.041
But I-I don't feel that way.
I don't feel that way at all.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.477
What about all those rumors
I heard about you and Nate?

00:42.564 --> 00:43.913
Completely untrue.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.393
They just got people off
my back about being sad

00:45.480 --> 00:47.699
and then Nate could do
whatever he wanted.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.527
[Serena]
When you told me that your
secret girlfriend was older

00:49.614 --> 00:51.051
I thought you meant college.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.748
Not to mention,
Catherine's married.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.097
I just wish
I could make her feel

00:54.184 --> 00:55.446
as badly
as I feel right now.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.840
You totally can.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.668
[Catherine]
I can't believe that you
would try to make me jealous

00:59.755 --> 01:01.496
in front of my husband
and our friends.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.759
- Well, did it work?
- Completely.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
[Dan]
I haven't been able to get
you out of my head all summer.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.030
And who am I?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.858
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.861
You know you love me.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.777
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.868
As summer comes to an end,
I'd like to share

01:25.955 --> 01:28.436
a few of the things I've
learned about fun in the sun.

01:28.523 --> 01:31.265
Gossip Girl's guide
to summer, tip number one.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.702
Don't fall asleep on the job.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.791
The best hookups are free of
morning breath

01:35.878 --> 01:38.272
and awkward conversation.

01:38.359 --> 01:41.144
The only thing harder
than making up is waking up.

- Overwhelmed?
- Confused.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.956
[sighs]

02:11.043 --> 02:12.262
Last night was--

02:12.349 --> 02:13.307
It was amazing.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.528
And confusing.

02:17.615 --> 02:20.749
Okay.
Now I'm-I'm a little confused.

02:20.836 --> 02:24.492
Well, it was so romantic
what you did, showing up here.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.799
And it feels so right
to be together.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.499
But you're having
second thoughts.

02:31.586 --> 02:35.633
No. I, I just think
that we should think..

02:35.720 --> 02:38.723
...before we get
back together, right?

02:38.810 --> 02:40.551
Y-yeah, I mean,
I thought..

02:40.638 --> 02:42.466
I thought this meant
we wereback together.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.908
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.388
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:51.475 --> 02:55.349
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not at all.

02:55.436 --> 02:58.743
And neither am I, and-and
I want to keep it that way.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.268
But this is a big decision,
and-and we did break up

03:01.355 --> 03:02.747
for a reason..

03:02.834 --> 03:04.923
Many reasons.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.187
But this was
never our problem.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.411
Okay.

03:14.498 --> 03:18.110
I will see you
back in the city..

03:18.198 --> 03:20.243
...fully clothed..

03:20.330 --> 03:22.463
...with lots

Summer tip number two

03:37.869 --> 03:41.482
There is no we in summer,
only you and me.

03:41.569 --> 03:45.094
Find out where you stand before
you find yourself stood up.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.662
Anyone can canoodle
in July and August

03:47.749 --> 03:50.491
but will he be gone
by September?

03:50.578 --> 03:51.796
So what's next?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.189
I was thinking breakfast.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.930
A little French toast,
some coffee.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.453
[laughs]
No.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.628
I mean, since you don't go

03:57.715 --> 03:59.195
to Princeton or Georgetown

03:59.282 --> 04:01.806
I assume you're
not headed back to college.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.374
So where are you headed?
Are you staying here?

04:04.461 --> 04:05.636
Would it be
too forward of me

04:05.723 --> 04:08.900
to say I'll go
wherever you go?

04:08.987 --> 04:10.598
I'd be honored, My Lord.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.643
Blair, you don't have to call me
that.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.690
- In fact, you shouldn't.
- I know. Don't worry.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.605
I was up all night
reading "Debrett's Peerage."

04:17.692 --> 04:19.737
I'm well versed
in your lordly ways

04:19.824 --> 04:21.217
and I'm ready
to meet the queen

04:21.304 --> 04:24.133
which I also watched
on DVD, BTW.

- Senior year awaits.
- Mm, let me think.

04:39.496 --> 04:42.673
A beautiful girl,
autumn in New York.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.632
Well, I think I could find
some way to entertain myself.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.416
- Really?
- Absolutely.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.070
My family will be glad

04:48.157 --> 04:49.854
I'm staying in one place
for a while.

04:49.941 --> 04:53.380
Oh, your family. I'd love
to meet the duke and duchess.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.296
Duchess, right.
W-well, we'll see.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.996
Will you excuse me
for a moment?

05:05.870 --> 05:06.828
Things are going south

05:06.915 --> 05:08.046
with Lord Marcus.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.179
- Who's Lord Marcus?
- 'James.'

05:10.266 --> 05:11.223
It turns out that he was only

05:11.311 --> 05:13.008
pretending to be a commoner.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.488
It's like "Roman Holiday."

05:14.575 --> 05:15.532
Only I'm Gregory Peck

05:15.619 --> 05:16.881
and he's Audrey Hepburn.

05:16.968 --> 05:20.232
Oh, suddenly it's all so clear.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.538
He's not really
a college student.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.106
He's a Lord,
and I love him.

05:24.193 --> 05:28.110
Okay, I'm gonna take your word
for it, but, Blair, love?

05:28.197 --> 05:30.417
Like, very much, and not just
because Tom Hanks

05:30.504 --> 05:32.680
gave him a Kleenex
at Lady Di's funeral.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.290
And you really expect me to
believe

05:34.377 --> 05:36.074
this isn't all
about revenge on Chuck?

05:36.161 --> 05:39.991
Revenge is so 12 hours ago,
and just because Marcus happens

05:40.078 --> 05:41.993
to be the perfect
post-Bass palate cleanser

05:42.080 --> 05:44.735
doesn't mean he isn't a
delicious dish in his own right.

05:44.822 --> 05:47.042
'Okay, so it sounds like
you guys are soul mates.'

05:47.129 --> 05:48.522
What exactly is the problem?

05:48.609 --> 05:50.437
He's being vague
about the future.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.751
- Marcus. Hey.
- Hello, Chuck.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.839
I was just getting something
to eat.

06:01.926 --> 06:02.840
Do you mind if I join you?

06:02.927 --> 06:03.928
I do, yes.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.887
Uh, I'm dining with Blair.

06:05.974 --> 06:09.934
And I feel I should tell you,
I know you two have a history.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.763
Around here, who doesn't?
But you're with Blair now.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.897
I get that. There's no reason
we can't be civil.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.769
After all, isn't that a trait
your people pride themselves on?

06:18.856 --> 06:19.988
Right.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.861
Well, for England then.

06:23.948 --> 06:26.124
- Shall we?
- We shall.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.952
Wait, you just found out
this guy's real identity.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.476
I think it's a little soon

06:29.563 --> 06:31.260
to be worrying about
the rest of your lives.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.698
But not the rest of the year.
It's the season for flings.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.832
Tennis pros and townies.
I'm his secret summer shame.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.312
Blair Waldorf, a fling?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.054
Hmm. You're not exactly
low maintenance.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.883
Speaking of,
where were you last night?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.624
'Did the lifeguard
turn up at the party'

06:47.711 --> 06:49.060
'or did you find
another disposable?'

06:49.147 --> 06:52.412
Uh, sorry, Blair.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.848
I have to go.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.197
Wait. Serena!

06:58.287 --> 07:00.507
Hi. Hey,
I thought you were gonna--

07:00.594 --> 07:01.682
I thought
you'd take the train.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.292
The train. Yeah.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.077
But you're taking the Jitney.
Me, too.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.384
I-I was-I was just gonna use
some of that downtime

07:08.471 --> 07:09.385
to do some of the thinking
that we talked about.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.256
And you should.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.868
You know, just 'cause, um,
we're not gonna make out

07:13.955 --> 07:16.653
doesn't mean we have
to totally avoid each other.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.526
Yeah, right. Well, uh, it's not
like we're-we're animals.

07:19.613 --> 07:23.094
I think-I think we can share
the same bus without, uh

07:23.181 --> 07:24.792
r-running off together.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.708
- I'm gonna sit over here.
- I'll be here.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.013
[clears throat]

07:36.194 --> 07:37.718
[Chuck]
'And that's me.'

07:37.805 --> 07:40.851
- Fantastic. I'll call you.
- Please, and, uh--

07:40.938 --> 07:43.201
Chuck, what are you doing
in my chair?

07:43.288 --> 07:48.119
Oh, we've got a date to play
squash at Chuck's father's club.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.034
Charles, sidebar.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.471
Actually,
we weren't finished.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.560
Notice how my voice
didn't go up at the end?

07:53.647 --> 07:54.865
Not a question.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.302
[chuckles]

07:57.389 --> 08:01.002
- Squash? I'll squash you.
- It's just a game, Blair.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.830
It's not to me, Bass-hole.
I like him.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.876
And so do I, and apparently, he
doesn't have too many friends.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.319
Chuck just informed me
that he and Serena

08:14.406 --> 08:16.583
are leaving immediately.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.933
Do you think I could catch
a ride back into town with you?

08:19.020 --> 08:19.977
Of course.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.636
Hey, mom. It's looking
really nice out here.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.073
Thanks. I couldn't sleep,
so I got up early.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.945
Are you going somewhere?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.555
Yeah, I'm gonna head
back into the city, actually.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.426
But there's still
a few more days of vacation.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.211
Yeah, I know, I figured it'd be
good to get back in

08:36.298 --> 08:37.517
and settled
before school starts.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.694
I mean, Louisa's
at the house, right?

08:40.781 --> 08:41.825
It's-it's not a big deal.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.131
No.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.743
I haven't wanted
to tell you this

08:46.830 --> 08:48.615
but you're going
to find out soon enough.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.139
Find out what?

08:51.226 --> 08:54.664
The federal prosecutor has taken
your father's leaving town

08:54.751 --> 08:56.884
as an admission of guilt.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.147
They want to forfeit
our assets..

08:59.234 --> 09:00.278
...for restitution.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.889
What, they wanna
take our money?

09:01.976 --> 09:05.457
Well, not yet, but they
have frozen our accounts.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.981
And now they're making
an inventory

09:07.068 --> 09:08.635
of everything that we own.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.375
I asked your granddad
for help.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.378
- What, you told grandpa?
- Not that it did any good.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.250
As you can imagine,
he's not very happy

09:15.337 --> 09:18.035
with my role
in your father's departure.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.081
For the time being at least,
I've been cut off.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.256
I can't believe
you knew all this

09:21.343 --> 09:22.910
and you didn't
say anything.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.999
All summer, I kept hoping
I could make it go away

09:25.086 --> 09:28.002
and maybe I still can,
which is why I need you to keep

09:28.089 --> 09:30.308
your chin up and trust that

If I'm gonna compete
with this guy

19:55.237 --> 19:56.804
I have to rise
to his level.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.023
Yeah, but don't you think
that's a little extreme?

19:59.110 --> 20:01.678
Maybe, but given the situation,
it's the right thing to do.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.858
And, uh, I should probably
get back to it.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.120
The sooner I get
it done, the sooner

20:09.208 --> 20:10.687
I can brag
about it to Blair.

20:10.774 --> 20:14.517
Okay, alright.

'Yeah. What's going on?'

20:25.311 --> 20:26.660
What are you up to
right now?

20:28.009 --> 20:29.663
Is this gonna take
much longer?

20:29.750 --> 20:32.056
I told Mrs. Archibald we could
have it done by tonight.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.454
- Hey, hey. It's me.
- 'Hey, you.'

20:38.541 --> 20:40.151

- 'Yeah.'

20:40.239 --> 20:41.283
'Yeah, and listen,
before you say anything else'

20:41.370 --> 20:43.459
I just want
to let you know that, uh

20:43.546 --> 20:46.332
this morning,
on the, on the bus..

20:46.419 --> 20:49.813

stick to the plan, did we?

'Well, uh, no.
The plan was deeply flawed.'

20:51.772 --> 20:54.165
I think we overestimated
our powers of restraint.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.167
Or, uh,
I-I-I did, at least.

Yeah, me, too, but then
I realized something.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.911
- Yeah, me, too.
- Really?

21:00.998 --> 21:02.261
Yeah, well, uh..

figure anything out for real

21:07.048 --> 21:10.269

to take some time...alone.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.055
Oh.
Sure.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.973
Yeah, um, but Blair's
not gonna like that.

She just wants you
to come to a party.

21:33.161 --> 21:35.076
Yeah, well,
I'll be there

we can start'

new plan tomorrow.'

just trying to scare us

for scaring you this morning.

to fix things after all.

where dad is, did you?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.273
Of course not.

from a family friend.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.933
Okay, but I just find it
hard to believe

22:50.020 --> 22:51.457
that you opened up
to one of the book club ladies

22:51.544 --> 22:53.589
and told them
we're completely broke.

22:53.676 --> 22:56.331
He's not in book club. He's
outside of my regular circle.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.942
Oh, so you just asked someone
you barely know for money?

22:59.029 --> 23:02.163
I didn't ask. He offered,
and when I tried to refuse

23:02.250 --> 23:04.121
he insisted that it was
the right thing to do.

- Nate, please stop it.

so young or so beautiful.

Just because I didn't give
birth to Marcus

interested in his well-being.

I don't usually take meetings
with children, Charles
