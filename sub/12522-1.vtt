04:42.847 --> 04:45.808
<i>Did you ever meet Don Juan?</i>

04:45.933 --> 04:48.019
<i>Never. Not once!</i>

04:48.144 --> 04:51.105
<i>Then why are you in mourning?
Because I've never met him.</i>

04:53.232 --> 04:56.819
It's amazing. I had no idea
my own funeral could be so delightful.

04:56.944 --> 05:00.573
It certainly brought your
career to a happy end. End?

05:00.698 --> 05:03.242
<i>Leave off while they still
think of you as you were.</i>

05:03.368 --> 05:05.703
<i>All these wrinkles,
these lines, these gray hairs.</i>

05:05.828 --> 05:09.457
You'd spoil any party,
even a funeral.

05:09.582 --> 05:12.919
No, no, no, my friend.
This is a great sight.

05:13.044 --> 05:15.254
Women and women and women.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.674
The eternal hunger of women for love.

05:26.683 --> 05:29.268
I pretty much have all my stuff.

05:38.444 --> 05:40.863
Looks like you got a love letter
from one of your other girlfriends.

05:40.989 --> 05:44.409
I don't have any other girlfriend,
Sherry. Come on!

05:45.410 --> 05:47.412
All right. I get it.

05:49.288 --> 05:52.583
No, you don't.
But it's okay.

05:52.709 --> 05:56.129
That's the way you are.
You're never going to change.

05:56.254 --> 05:59.215
I just don't think
I want to be with an-

05:59.340 --> 06:02.135
an over-the-hill Don Juan anymore.

06:04.512 --> 06:06.556
What do you want, Sherry?

06:06.681 --> 06:08.599
<i>What do you want, Don?</i>

06:08.725 --> 06:12.437
I mean, I'm like your mistress,

06:12.562 --> 06:14.605
except you're not even married.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.609
L-Look at your friend Winston
next door.

06:18.735 --> 06:21.863
It looks like
they're having a great time.

06:21.988 --> 06:24.907
Don't you ever want to have a family?

06:27.118 --> 06:29.704
Well, is that what you want?

06:32.457 --> 06:36.794
I don't know what I want, but I just
want to figure it out by myself.

06:38.254 --> 06:40.173
By yourself.

06:40.298 --> 06:42.175
Yeah.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.969
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

06:54.354 --> 06:56.230
<i>Sherry?</i>

07:41.609 --> 07:43.903
<i>What are you but a female?
Same as you!</i>

07:44.028 --> 07:46.364
<i>Nobody asked you. He never kissed you.
It was an impudent lie!</i>

07:46.489 --> 07:48.866
<i>Yes, it was a lie. Don Juan told
me so himself. It was only publicity.</i>

07:48.992 --> 07:50.868
<i>He did not!
Don't you-</i>

07:50.994 --> 07:53.121
<i>And who are you to give orders here?
Who am I?</i>

07:53.287 --> 07:56.666
Don Juan said I was the girl whose kiss he'd
been seeking on a thousand women's lips!

07:56.833 --> 07:59.544
I was the only one. He'd never love
anybody else in his life!

07:59.669 --> 08:02.088
<i>Ha! He loved you so much that he went
straight from you to another woman.</i>

08:02.213 --> 08:04.590
<i>He loved me!
And loathed young women like you.</i>

08:04.716 --> 08:06.384
<i>Cat!
Cow!</i>

08:06.509 --> 08:07.760
Snake!
Pig!

08:07.885 --> 08:09.304
Goat!
Weasel!

08:09.429 --> 08:11.055
Worm!
No, no, no, no!

08:48.009 --> 08:49.927
Yeah?

08:51.471 --> 08:53.389
Hey, Winston.

08:53.514 --> 08:55.475
You at work?

08:56.851 --> 08:59.479
It's Saturday. Of course. Yeah.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.737
No, I just got up.

09:11.199 --> 09:13.368
What, you can't access the site?

09:17.997 --> 09:20.416
Yeah. All right. I'll be right over.

09:22.585 --> 09:25.546
Yes. Coffee would be good.

09:27.298 --> 09:30.218
Will it be a cup of Ethiopian coffee?

09:32.387 --> 09:34.347
Okay.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.758
Good morning.

10:10.883 --> 10:12.802
<i>Morning, Don!</i>

10:20.351 --> 10:23.563
Hey, you two.
Keep your eyes on the Cheerios.

10:28.067 --> 10:31.321
How's the sweetest grape on the vine?
I'm good.

10:31.446 --> 10:34.782
Winston is in the back,
on his computer,

10:34.907 --> 10:36.868
in his office.

10:36.993 --> 10:39.370
<i>Irie.</i>

10:44.709 --> 10:46.544
Thank you, Don.

10:52.091 --> 10:55.637
What's up, Winston? Hey, Don. Listen.
I can't seem to access this site.

10:55.762 --> 10:58.806
I need your computer expertise.
Yeah? What is it?

10:58.931 --> 11:02.685
It's like a whole system for breaking
down the plots of detective fiction...

11:02.810 --> 11:04.771
or the solution of crimes.

11:04.896 --> 11:07.106
Y- Click.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.942
Yes. You see?

11:10.068 --> 11:12.445
And click. I tried before.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.031
Stay calm.
Click. Uh-

11:15.156 --> 11:17.325
Go get 'em, Sherlock.

11:17.450 --> 11:19.369
Cool, cool, cool.

11:21.996 --> 11:25.249
Oh, this is my kind
of information, man.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.835
I love the Net.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.632
The whole world of information-
through the wall, click.

11:33.758 --> 11:37.011
You sure you don't want a
computer at your house? No.

11:37.136 --> 11:39.097
Seems awful strange to me.

11:39.222 --> 11:43.851
A man who made all of his money off of
computers doesn't want to have one in his house.

11:46.521 --> 11:48.439
Oh!

11:50.191 --> 11:52.151
Cool. Cool.
This is fascinating.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.905
Supposedly, you can use this
to write a mystery novel...

11:56.030 --> 11:58.241
or to solve a complicated crime.

11:58.366 --> 12:00.785
If-

12:00.910 --> 12:03.037
Don.

12:03.162 --> 12:05.081
You all right?

12:06.207 --> 12:08.084
What?

12:10.253 --> 12:12.213
Is something wrong?

12:14.007 --> 12:15.925
Well, it's probably nothing.

12:16.050 --> 12:21.014
Uh, a love letter
from one of your lovely ladies.

12:21.139 --> 12:23.474
Something like that.

12:25.727 --> 12:27.854
I'll read it to you.

12:27.979 --> 12:33.276
"Dear Don, sometimes life
brings some strange surprises.

12:33.401 --> 12:36.070
"It's been almost 20 years
since we've seen each other,

12:36.195 --> 12:39.657
"but now there's something
I need to tell you.

12:39.782 --> 12:43.453
"Years ago, after our story ended,

12:43.578 --> 12:45.830
"I discovered I was pregnant.

12:45.955 --> 12:50.710
"I decided to go through with the
pregnancy, and I had a baby, a son.

12:50.835 --> 12:52.795
"Your son.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.965
"I decided to raise him by myself
because our time together...

12:56.090 --> 12:58.843
"had come to a close.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.429
"My son is now almost 19.

13:02.805 --> 13:06.601
"He's somewhat shy and secretive,
unlike you,

13:06.726 --> 13:09.020
"but a sensitive, wonderful person.

13:09.145 --> 13:12.649
"A few days ago he left
on a mysterious road trip,

13:12.774 --> 13:15.943
"but I'm almost certain
he's searching for his father.

13:16.069 --> 13:18.696
"I've told him almost nothing about you,

13:18.863 --> 13:22.408
"but he's resourceful and imaginative.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.328
"Anyway, if this is, in fact,
your correct address,

13:25.495 --> 13:28.373
well, I just felt
I should let you know."

13:30.875 --> 13:32.794
There's no signature...

13:34.295 --> 13:36.255
and no return address.

13:36.381 --> 13:39.217
Hey, congratulations!
You're a father.

13:43.304 --> 13:46.057
Uh, you're really upset by this.
C-Can I see it?

13:55.733 --> 13:58.695
Your address is handwritten,

13:58.820 --> 14:00.822
but printed.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.282
Red ink on pink paper.

14:05.118 --> 14:07.036
Typewriter.

14:08.579 --> 14:11.874
<i>A red ribbon. Curious.</i>

14:14.460 --> 14:18.589
"Dear Don, sometimes"-

14:18.715 --> 14:20.591
Hmm.

14:26.097 --> 14:28.725
Damn. This postmark is too
faint to read. That's fucked up.

14:28.850 --> 14:30.685
Tsk-tsk.

14:30.852 --> 14:35.023
And you have no idea
who this is from?

14:35.189 --> 14:37.400
Nope.

14:37.525 --> 14:39.402
None.

14:39.527 --> 14:41.612
But from all I know,

14:41.738 --> 14:44.657
you are like, uh-
like Don Juan or something.

14:47.076 --> 14:48.953
Don Juan.

14:56.294 --> 14:59.047
I gotta go.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.677
You want me to keep the letter
for forensic evidence or... clues?

15:04.802 --> 15:06.929
Or- Don.

15:11.851 --> 15:13.728
Hmm.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.044
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

15:38.169 --> 15:40.129
I see that.

15:47.470 --> 15:49.806
It's kind of lonely in here, man.

15:54.227 --> 15:56.062
Do you mind?

16:07.657 --> 16:10.994
Is Sherry coming home?
No.

16:12.412 --> 16:14.831
She left.

16:15.039 --> 16:17.917
<i>What do you mean, "She left"?
She went on a trip?</i>

16:18.042 --> 16:20.837
No. I mean, she left.

16:22.588 --> 16:24.465
Sorry, man.

16:24.590 --> 16:28.177
Yeah, me too. I think.

16:32.181 --> 16:35.101
Well, but knowing Sherry, she probably
hasn't played her last card yet. Right?

16:35.226 --> 16:37.145
Probably not.

16:38.604 --> 16:41.441
Anyway, you've never had trouble
finding interesting females.

16:41.566 --> 16:44.110
I mean, uh, that's the way your life
has been though. Right?

16:44.277 --> 16:46.654
You're like, uh- like Don Juan.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.074
Winston, please stop saying that.

16:55.955 --> 16:58.249
Hey.

16:58.374 --> 17:02.879
About this letter- I did examine
the postmark under my microscope.

17:03.046 --> 17:06.549
<i>And it is too faint to read,
but the stamp-</i>

17:06.674 --> 17:08.635
it's got on it a woodpecker.

17:09.761 --> 17:13.013
<i>What does that mean to you?
Anything?</i>

17:15.433 --> 17:17.894
Well, what I think we should do...

17:18.019 --> 17:20.229
is to narrow down the possibilities.

17:20.355 --> 17:23.441
Winston, this is probably
someone playing a joke on me.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.319
If not, then...

17:26.444 --> 17:28.363
whatever.

17:29.656 --> 17:32.909
It seems so unfair-
someone to write a letter like this...

17:33.034 --> 17:35.119
and-and-and not sign it?

17:35.244 --> 17:37.705
Don't you want to know
who is the mother of your son?

17:37.830 --> 17:40.875
My hypothetical son?
No, Winston.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.919
<i>I don't, okay?</i>

17:43.962 --> 17:45.838
Okay.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.800
<i>Then we can just drop it.
We can?</i>

17:48.967 --> 17:51.928
We can, of course. Okay.

17:52.095 --> 17:54.222
<i>Good.
It's dropped.</i>

18:14.158 --> 18:16.995
But then how can you ignore
something like this?

18:17.161 --> 18:20.581
- You need to treat this as a sign.
- What kind of sign?

18:20.707 --> 18:22.667
<i>Of the direction of your life.</i>

18:22.792 --> 18:25.169
Of this present moment.

18:25.295 --> 18:29.215
<i>You need to solve this mystery...</i>

18:29.340 --> 18:34.012
and find out which of your women it was that
you impregnated with your semen 20 years ago.

18:34.137 --> 18:36.055
Winston.

18:39.767 --> 18:42.729
<i>What happened to
that groovin' CD I burned for you?</i>

18:46.274 --> 18:48.860
Here it is. Do you mind?

19:00.747 --> 19:03.041
Ah, that's nice.
Ethiopian sounds.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.251
It's good for the heart.

19:18.431 --> 19:21.851
Look, come over tomorrow
for, uh, Sunday brunch,

19:21.976 --> 19:25.104
and, uh, we'll talk a little further
about our investigative plan, huh?

19:25.229 --> 19:27.190
So I'll leave that right there.

19:27.315 --> 19:29.317
Go home and leave me alone.

19:29.442 --> 19:31.694
Okay, man. I love you too.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.349
I think your father's real name
is Sam Spade.

20:01.474 --> 20:03.851
My father isn't Sam Spade.

20:03.977 --> 20:07.146
No? Think he's Sherlock Holmes?

20:07.313 --> 20:09.732
No.

20:09.857 --> 20:13.403
Well, I know he's one of those
famous detectives. Mike Hammer!

20:13.528 --> 20:15.655
No, not Mike Hammer.

20:17.156 --> 20:19.784
Oh, I know.
He's that Dolemite guy. Right?

20:19.909 --> 20:22.704
No, not Dolemite.
No?

20:26.833 --> 20:29.961
He's down.

20:34.799 --> 20:38.011
Keep your eyes open.
He may be Dolemite. No!

20:38.136 --> 20:40.054
Mona,

20:40.179 --> 20:42.056
thank you.

20:42.181 --> 20:46.019
That was so delicious.
You're welcome. Anytime.

20:46.227 --> 20:48.062
Really?
Mm-hmm.

20:48.187 --> 20:49.897
What time's dinner?

20:50.023 --> 20:52.650
You are the most perfect woman
in the world.

20:52.775 --> 20:55.862
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tell you something. That's mine.

20:55.987 --> 20:58.072
Come, come, come.

20:58.197 --> 21:00.450
No cigarettes.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.753
That's where you get your appetite.

21:11.878 --> 21:13.838
Your woman cooks too good.

21:14.881 --> 21:18.092
I'd like to look at that pink
letter again. Let me see it.

21:18.217 --> 21:22.138
I burned it last night- microwave.
Yes, little Rita?

21:22.263 --> 21:24.223
Papa, you're smoking again.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.810
No, no, no. This is just herbs.
It's just a little Cheeba. Hmm?

21:27.977 --> 21:29.896
Let me see that.

21:35.568 --> 21:37.487
<i>He's right.
It's just cannabis sativa.</i>

21:37.612 --> 21:39.572
You see?
Just a little indigo, baby.

21:39.697 --> 21:43.117
'Cause Mama says,
"No more smoking tobacco anymore."

21:43.242 --> 21:45.536
Yeah, I know. I gave it up. Never!

21:45.703 --> 21:49.499
Never! No more tobacco.
I promise. Okay.

21:53.711 --> 21:56.673
Come, come, come, come.
Let me see this mysterious pink letter.

22:14.983 --> 22:19.320
Okay. What you have to
do for me is make a list.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.699
A list.

22:22.824 --> 22:26.911
I need the possibilities
of who the mother might be.

22:27.036 --> 22:31.165
You give me a list of all your
girlfriends from back then,

22:31.291 --> 22:33.584
and then I can plan everything.

22:37.672 --> 22:39.757
Uh, I think I'm going home, Sherlock.

22:39.924 --> 22:43.052
Just destroy that letter when
you're through with it, will you?

22:44.137 --> 22:45.972
Work on that list.

23:00.069 --> 23:01.946
Hello, Winston?

23:03.906 --> 23:05.783
What list?

23:08.745 --> 23:11.456
<i>No, haven't even thought about it.</i>

23:11.581 --> 23:13.583
Are you on a cell phone?

23:15.126 --> 23:18.254
Yeah. Is it okay if I run in
and grab that list?

23:19.380 --> 23:23.051
Sure. Why not?
Great. Hold on a second.

23:28.848 --> 23:31.309
Any other info
on where they might be?

23:31.434 --> 23:34.604
Not really. That's where they
lived or their families lived.

23:34.729 --> 23:38.107
That's all I can remember.
Good. Cool.

23:40.401 --> 23:42.570
Okay. Sorry about that.
It's okay.

23:42.695 --> 23:44.614
Look, man. I'm all over this.

23:44.739 --> 23:47.659
The day after tomorrow,
I'll have everything ready.

23:47.784 --> 23:49.827
Knock yourself out.

24:55.059 --> 24:59.105
Don, man, my lunch break's almost over.
Sorry. What's up?

24:59.230 --> 25:02.191
Look, I got all the info right here,
based on your list,

25:02.317 --> 25:04.235
plus the whole plan.

25:07.071 --> 25:08.990
You got addresses, married names,

25:09.115 --> 25:11.200
in some cases even their jobs.

25:11.326 --> 25:13.244
I've got some sad news though.
What?

25:13.369 --> 25:15.663
That girl named Michelle Pepe?

25:15.788 --> 25:18.499
She died in a car accident...

25:18.625 --> 25:20.501
<i>five years ago.</i>

25:20.627 --> 25:25.298
I found the name of the cemetery
where she-well, where she is.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.592
Little Michelle Pepe?

25:27.759 --> 25:30.428
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

25:30.553 --> 25:33.556
<i>But the other four-
I got all their info.</i>

25:35.099 --> 25:37.518
Well, that's...
very impressive, Winston.

25:37.644 --> 25:41.147
I really don't know why you did all of
this. What am I supposed to do about it?

25:41.356 --> 25:43.733
Look, your whole trip-
it's all planned.

25:43.858 --> 25:47.236
Booked reservations, rental cars.
Everything you need.

25:47.362 --> 25:51.240
- All you have to do is give them the credit card.
- What are you talking about?

25:51.366 --> 25:55.286
You go visit them.
You go to their houses. You see them.

25:55.411 --> 25:58.414
You bring flowers, pink flowers.
You're just checking in.

26:00.416 --> 26:02.251
Just checking in.

26:02.377 --> 26:06.089
<i>I even got maps.
Everything you need.</i>

26:06.214 --> 26:10.677
And I burned you a new CD, see?

26:10.802 --> 26:14.055
<i>That's traveling music.
That I'll take.</i>

26:15.974 --> 26:19.018
Uh, just coffee, please, Avis.
Thank you.

26:19.185 --> 26:22.605
A few tips though.
Dress conservative, a little classy.

26:22.730 --> 26:24.607
Don't give anything away.

26:24.732 --> 26:28.820
And always, always bring flowers.
Pink flowers.

26:28.945 --> 26:31.906
<i>And look for clues about your son-
photographs, anything.</i>

26:32.031 --> 26:35.660
<i>Or hints, like pink stationery
and red ink.</i>

26:35.785 --> 26:38.246
<i>Handwriting, if possible.
And find that typewriter.</i>

26:38.371 --> 26:40.540
Bring me that typewriter,

26:40.707 --> 26:43.376
and then I can forensically
match the type...

26:43.501 --> 26:45.378
to the letter.

26:45.503 --> 26:48.214
You're insane, Winston.

26:48.339 --> 26:52.093
Even if you could possibly
rope me into this nonsense,

26:52.260 --> 26:54.137
which you can't,

26:54.304 --> 26:57.432
I'm not a detective, I'm not a private
eye in one of your crime novels.

27:00.059 --> 27:03.229
Forget it. No fuckin' way.

27:03.354 --> 27:06.566
<i>What, after all the work I've done?
Well, you do it.</i>

27:06.691 --> 27:09.235
You take the trip.
I'll pay for it.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.280
<i>Me? Impossible.
I've got three jobs and five kids.</i>

27:12.405 --> 27:15.116
<i>And, besides, it's your life.</i>

27:15.241 --> 27:18.619
I've merely prepared the strategy.

27:18.745 --> 27:21.039
But only you can solve the mystery.

27:21.164 --> 27:23.207
And why is that?

27:23.333 --> 27:25.752
Because you understand women.

27:40.266 --> 27:42.226
Let me ask you something.

27:43.311 --> 27:45.813
Suppose I took this ridiculous trip,

27:45.938 --> 27:49.150
and say this kid really exists,

27:49.275 --> 27:52.028
and he shows up...
while I'm gone.

27:52.153 --> 27:54.656
Don, don't worry.
I'll monitor your house every day.

27:54.822 --> 27:57.283
Yeah? Then what?
What do you do? If he shows up?

27:57.450 --> 27:59.744
He shows up. Don't worry.
I apprehend him.

27:59.911 --> 28:03.081
Oh, okay. Great.
You apprehend him.

28:03.206 --> 28:07.794
Look, I've got seven minutes
before I'm due to punch in.

28:07.919 --> 28:12.256
Tomorrow morning, on my way to the
plant, I will drop you at the airport.

28:12.423 --> 28:14.842
No problem.
I got you an early flight.

28:14.968 --> 28:18.388
It's not gonna happen.
No way.

28:18.513 --> 28:21.599
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning
at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

31:42.508 --> 31:45.470
<i>My mom won't let me wear a bikini. I can't
believe your mom let you come on this trip.</i>

31:45.595 --> 31:48.556
<i>Oh, she doesn't know. I mean, she knows,
but she thinks that I'm with your family.</i>

31:48.681 --> 31:50.975
<i>No, she wouldn't have let me come, and
you would have been totally mad at me.</i>

31:51.100 --> 31:53.561
<i>What if she calls my mom? She's not gonna
call her. She thinks that she's here.</i>

31:53.728 --> 31:56.230
See, it's perfect. No, it'll be fine.
Don't worry. Wait, wait, wait. What?

31:56.356 --> 31:59.817
Don't even worry about it. Do I need to call
my mom? 'Cause my mom will totally lie for you.

31:59.942 --> 32:03.613
<i>I want to go to the party tonight, and I
really want to be able to meet some cute guys.</i>

32:03.738 --> 32:07.867
That guy is so cute that's sitting
behind me. Can you see him?

32:07.992 --> 32:10.745
<i>Oh, my God. He's really cute though.
Don't stare at him.</i>

32:10.870 --> 32:12.830
<i>He is cute.
He looks like a supermodel.</i>

32:12.956 --> 32:17.210
<i>No, he looks like the Calvin Klein model that's
on the side of the bus. Oh, my gosh. He's so cool.</i>

32:17.335 --> 32:20.797
<i>He's totally staring at us right now. Think Ally will take
us to get something to eat before we go? I'm starving!</i>

32:20.922 --> 32:23.633
<i>That's why you need the
mix-and-match for when you get fat.</i>

32:23.800 --> 32:26.386
<i>Oh, my God. I know! We're such heifers.
You get the bigger sizes.</i>

32:26.552 --> 32:28.805
<i>I look so fat.
Doughnut girl.</i>

33:46.549 --> 33:48.843
<i>Look for clues,</i>

33:48.968 --> 33:51.971
<i>like a typewriter,
like something pink.</i>

33:52.972 --> 33:55.642
<i>This will be very easy.</i>

34:37.058 --> 34:40.018
Hi, Laura. It's me, Don.
Remember me?

35:46.127 --> 35:48.546
Hi. Who are you?

35:48.671 --> 35:52.050
Don Johnston.
Really?

35:52.175 --> 35:54.969
You're Don Johnson?
Yeah- No.

35:55.094 --> 35:57.055
Johnston with a "T." Oh.

35:57.180 --> 36:00.266
Uh, does Laura Daniels, who was
formerly Laura Miller, live here?

36:00.391 --> 36:02.226
Yeah. That's my mom.

36:02.352 --> 36:04.354
Well, I'm a very old friend of hers,

36:04.479 --> 36:07.190
and I haven't seen her
in, um, in over-

36:07.315 --> 36:09.317
Well, come on in.

36:15.907 --> 36:20.411
So, my how'll be home from work soon,
so just sit down. Here.

36:20.536 --> 36:22.413
Make yourself comfortable.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.586
So, my name's Lola.

36:28.753 --> 36:33.299
Well, sometimes people call me Lo,
but my really real name is Lolita.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.343
Lolita?

36:36.469 --> 36:39.806
Yeah.

36:42.266 --> 36:46.980
Well, l-I don't- Do you want something?
'Cause we've got Popsicles.

36:48.856 --> 36:51.985
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

36:52.110 --> 36:54.237
<i>Lolita.
Yeah?</i>

36:55.780 --> 36:59.033
<i>Do you have any brothers
or sisters? Why?</i>

36:59.158 --> 37:01.536
Do you think I need some?

37:04.706 --> 37:07.250
Oh, wait, that's my phone.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.669
Just-Just stay there.
I'll be right back, okay?

37:09.794 --> 37:12.171
<i>Okay.</i>

38:15.193 --> 38:18.738
That's so crazy.

38:18.863 --> 38:21.199
Really?

38:21.366 --> 38:23.076
<i>That's so sick.</i>

38:23.201 --> 38:26.871
He didn't. Wait. Hold on.
My cell phone's ringing. Hello?

38:26.996 --> 38:30.583
<i>Yeah. I know. I just talked to her.</i>

38:30.708 --> 38:32.710
That's crazy, right?

38:32.877 --> 38:34.796
<i>I know.</i>

39:03.533 --> 39:06.035
Can I help you with something?

39:14.085 --> 39:16.087
Donny, is that you?

39:18.506 --> 39:20.425
Hey, Laura.

39:23.553 --> 39:25.513
What are you doing here?

39:48.745 --> 39:51.205
We're having chicken for dinner.

39:56.419 --> 39:58.963
That was quite an outfit
you weren't wearing earlier.

40:01.883 --> 40:04.427
Well, here we are.

40:20.276 --> 40:25.031
<i>Then Larry exploded
in a ball of flames at the track.</i>

40:26.115 --> 40:29.661
That happened,
and now it's just me and Lo.

40:36.376 --> 40:38.294
It was even on TV.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.967
I'm sorry.

40:47.428 --> 40:49.931
Lo, your head looks
just like a pineapple.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.850
- Mom!
- Doesn't it?

40:52.976 --> 40:55.728
Yeah, it does look like a pineapple.

40:58.564 --> 41:01.442
So, what, uh-

41:02.777 --> 41:06.322
Where do you work?
Oh, Mom has her own business. Right?

41:06.447 --> 41:08.324
Yeah.
Really?

41:08.449 --> 41:10.868
I'm a professional closet organizer.

41:10.994 --> 41:14.330
Come on.
No, I organize people's closets.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.625
I even do their drawers.

41:17.750 --> 41:22.046
I label everything.
I get them all organized.

41:22.171 --> 41:24.424
I even color coordinate them.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.927
Yeah. And they pay her for that.
It's amazing.

41:28.094 --> 41:30.888
<i>- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

41:33.808 --> 41:36.978
Lolita, I said you- Lolita!

41:37.103 --> 41:38.980
I said you could have a taste.

41:39.105 --> 41:42.984
Now, come on. That's enough of that.
That's not cool.

41:45.028 --> 41:47.655
Lolita. Interesting choice
of name, Laura.

41:50.617 --> 41:52.535
What?

41:55.622 --> 41:59.876
<i>So, Donny, I heard you made it big
in business a few years ago?</i>

42:01.044 --> 42:02.962
What are you into?

42:03.087 --> 42:05.840
It was computers.
Oh, high-tech stuff.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.010
More high tech than pencils, I guess.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.554
Mr. Fancy Pants!

42:14.265 --> 42:17.226
<i>Yeah, my pants are fancy.
So what?</i>

42:22.649 --> 42:24.609
So I see you're having a yard sale?

42:24.734 --> 42:28.029
Uh, you got me.
It's something we do on Saturdays.

42:28.154 --> 42:31.240
Yeah, Larry had all this crap
in the garage, and-

42:31.366 --> 42:34.786
And then I got this neighbor
to paint a sign for us.

42:34.911 --> 42:36.746
It's fun.

42:36.913 --> 42:40.291
Are you gonna be selling
any old, uh, typewriters?

42:40.416 --> 42:42.669
No.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.254
Wh- That's so 20th century.

42:47.006 --> 42:50.259
Did you come all the way down here
to get a typewriter, Don?

42:52.178 --> 42:54.889
What do you want a typewriter for?

42:56.307 --> 42:59.268
An old friend asked me if I would
look around for a typewriter.

42:59.394 --> 43:03.022
So... I just remembered it.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.905
Well-

43:12.073 --> 43:14.742
You know, I forgot to make dessert.

43:14.867 --> 43:16.828
Oh, Don doesn't like Popsicles.

43:52.989 --> 43:55.074
Donny.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.160
What are you doing here?

43:58.870 --> 44:01.706
I was just looking for a typewriter.

44:01.831 --> 44:03.958
Oh.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.628
I remember.

44:18.014 --> 44:19.891
Bye.

44:26.230 --> 44:28.107
Hey.

44:34.739 --> 44:36.658
Bye, Don.

44:36.866 --> 44:39.285
Good-bye, Laura.

44:44.082 --> 44:45.959
<i>Come back sometime.</i>

44:46.084 --> 44:48.002
<i>See you, Laura.</i>

45:06.437 --> 45:09.148
Lo! Go.
Put some clothes on.

48:33.978 --> 48:36.689
Can I help you?
Dora?

48:36.814 --> 48:39.275
Yes.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.569
It's me, Don.

48:41.694 --> 48:44.280
Remember me?

48:44.405 --> 48:46.324
Oh, Don!

48:48.076 --> 48:50.495
What-What are you doing here?

48:52.121 --> 48:54.123
I brought these flowers.

49:00.088 --> 49:02.507
So beautiful.

49:04.258 --> 49:06.177
Wanna come in?

49:28.950 --> 49:30.868
So,

49:32.870 --> 49:34.998
what brings you out here?

49:36.332 --> 49:40.253
Well, I was kind of in the area,
so I thought I'd drop in.

49:40.378 --> 49:42.714
I see.

49:42.839 --> 49:46.050
How- How did you
track me down, exactly?

49:46.175 --> 49:48.469
Uh, on the computer.

49:48.636 --> 49:50.555
They can do anything.

50:04.736 --> 50:06.696
Nice place you've got here.

50:06.821 --> 50:09.824
<i>Oh, thank you.
It's a nice example.</i>

50:09.991 --> 50:11.951
My husband and I are in real estate.

50:12.118 --> 50:14.454
<i>We sell landscape lots...</i>

50:14.621 --> 50:17.915
and preconstructed designer homes.

50:18.041 --> 50:21.669
Or do you already have this information
from your computer?

50:21.794 --> 50:23.921
<i>No.</i>

50:25.006 --> 50:26.883
Your card is pink.

50:28.509 --> 50:30.386
Yes.

50:30.511 --> 50:34.182
Ron, my husband, thought it would be cute
if mine were pink and his blue.

50:43.483 --> 50:46.319
I like those pearls.

50:48.696 --> 50:50.615
<i>Did I give you those?</i>

50:55.536 --> 50:57.497
I don't think so.

50:59.540 --> 51:01.459
<i>I should have.</i>

51:12.595 --> 51:15.390
It's very strange,
your showing up like this.

51:19.018 --> 51:20.979
<i>Yeah, it is strange.</i>

51:27.235 --> 51:29.946
It's my husband.

51:31.030 --> 51:34.701
<i>Hey! Where's my perfect little wi-</i>

51:34.826 --> 51:37.787
<i>Well, what have we here?</i>

51:40.290 --> 51:42.750
Hi. Don Johnston.

51:44.585 --> 51:46.796
I'm a really old
friend of Dora's. Oh.

51:46.921 --> 51:50.717
<i>You don't look really old.
Just kinda old.</i>

51:50.842 --> 51:53.136
<i>I'm Ron.</i>

51:53.261 --> 51:56.764
<i>Don Johnston.
Mm-hmm.</i>

51:56.889 --> 51:59.767
That's an old flame of yours,
right, honey?

51:59.934 --> 52:03.187
Don just dropped in
completely unexpectedly.

52:03.313 --> 52:07.483
<i>Wow! Nice to meet you, Don.</i>

52:07.608 --> 52:09.736
Ron and Don.

52:11.946 --> 52:15.325
Hey, uh, is Don gonna stay
for dinner? I hope.

52:15.450 --> 52:19.037
No. I really couldn't.

52:19.162 --> 52:21.372
Well, sure you could.

52:21.497 --> 52:24.250
Right? Honey?

52:35.219 --> 52:38.973
<i>Computers, huh? Wow.</i>

52:39.098 --> 52:41.517
<i>That's gotta be a lucrative field.</i>

52:41.684 --> 52:43.853
Yeah, I've done pretty well.

52:43.978 --> 52:48.274
Hmm. Well, the real estate biz
has been very good to us.

52:48.399 --> 52:50.276
<i>Right, hon?</i>

52:50.401 --> 52:53.237
At first I had the idea
of going into bottled water.

52:53.363 --> 52:57.659
I think in the near future, water
will be worth more than oil or gold.

52:57.784 --> 53:02.747
<i>Yeah. You're dying of thirst,
you can't take a swig of oil.</i>

53:02.872 --> 53:04.749
Right?

53:04.874 --> 53:07.752
Or gold, for that matter.

53:07.877 --> 53:11.589
Boy, you are certainly
right about that.

53:11.714 --> 53:13.967
But for right now,

53:14.092 --> 53:17.637
we decided that real estate
and quality prefab homes...

53:17.762 --> 53:19.973
was the right way to go.

53:20.098 --> 53:23.267
And it has been quite lucrative.

53:29.857 --> 53:32.610
Hon, those are beautiful flowers.

53:32.777 --> 53:34.696
Mmm.

53:38.741 --> 53:40.952
Hey!

53:41.119 --> 53:44.038
Don, I want to show you something.
Excuse me.

53:54.674 --> 53:56.509
Isn't this the coolest photo?

53:56.634 --> 53:59.429
Wow. Yeah.

53:59.554 --> 54:02.515
Yeah?
This is crazy, right?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.600
My straight little Dora.

54:06.144 --> 54:08.563
My adorable little Dora.
Mmm.

54:10.148 --> 54:12.025
Young hippie chick.

54:12.150 --> 54:15.361
That is great, Ron.
Now, could you please put it back?

54:15.528 --> 54:17.447
Sorry, baby.

54:19.073 --> 54:21.951
Probably brings back
one or two memories, huh, Don?

54:26.581 --> 54:28.458
I took that photo, didn't I?

54:30.585 --> 54:32.462
Mm-hmm.

54:35.548 --> 54:38.635
Well, you know, it's strange...

54:38.760 --> 54:41.888
how people's lives change, isn't it?

54:52.273 --> 54:54.233
So, any kids?

54:59.656 --> 55:03.326
Well, that's-
that's kind of a touchy subject.

55:03.493 --> 55:06.412
See, I always wanted
to have kids with Dora.

55:06.579 --> 55:08.957
You know, I mean, kids of our own.

55:09.082 --> 55:13.461
<i>But she didn't, really,
so I respect that.</i>

55:13.586 --> 55:18.216
Oh, I don't know if I would have had the
time and patience to be a good mother...

55:18.341 --> 55:20.802
to- to Ron's children.

55:23.596 --> 55:26.182
I'm just happy to have my Dora.

55:37.402 --> 55:39.279
What about you, Don?

55:39.404 --> 55:41.364
You married?

55:43.324 --> 55:45.285
No, I'm still a bachelor.

55:46.703 --> 55:49.080
A bachelor?

55:49.205 --> 55:51.082
Wow.

55:51.207 --> 55:54.335
But any kids?
He said he was still a bachelor.

55:54.502 --> 55:57.672
Well, honey, you know-

55:57.797 --> 56:01.217
You never know.
One or two could have gotten away.

56:03.177 --> 56:05.096
No. No kids I know of.

57:37.772 --> 57:39.607
Hello, Winston.

57:39.732 --> 57:42.694
Just a crazy guess.

57:45.113 --> 57:47.949
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing up here.

57:48.074 --> 57:50.034
I'm gettin' nowhere.

57:51.327 --> 57:53.705
Yeah, I saw her.

57:53.830 --> 57:56.749
Yeah, I saw her too.

57:56.874 --> 57:58.334
Yesterday.

58:00.003 --> 58:02.171
No. No clues.

58:02.297 --> 58:04.215
No typewriters.

58:07.010 --> 58:11.848
Couldn't you have rented me, like, a Porsche
or some car that I might really drive?

58:11.973 --> 58:14.892
I'm a stalker in a Taurus.

58:17.979 --> 58:21.858
I have done everything
that you wanted me to do, you know.

58:21.983 --> 58:24.027
I've really had enough of this.

58:24.152 --> 58:26.654
I think I oughta go back today.

58:28.364 --> 58:31.826
Yeah, but l- I don't-
I don't think I wanna see her.

58:35.747 --> 58:37.707
No, Winston-

58:40.543 --> 58:43.212
Winston, let me-
let me talk to you later, okay?

58:43.338 --> 58:45.590
Can I just-Yeah.

58:45.715 --> 58:48.134
Let me talk to you later.
Please?

58:48.259 --> 58:50.678
Okay? Thanks.

01:00:12.802 --> 01:00:15.847
I'll talk to you in a while.
Okay?

01:00:33.114 --> 01:00:35.950
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're now on our final descent.</i>

01:00:36.117 --> 01:00:39.454
<i>Please return to your seats and make sure your
seat belts are securely fastened. Thank you.</i>

01:02:16.175 --> 01:02:18.011
I heard what you said.

01:02:18.136 --> 01:02:20.221
And I heard what Dr. Markowski said.

01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:23.266
<i>You have to believe in yourself.</i>

01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:25.435
<i>I have a lot of respect for you.</i>

01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.895
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:30.898
<i>I understand, and I'll try
to do better next time.</i>

01:02:31.024 --> 01:02:32.900
Hi.

01:02:33.026 --> 01:02:37.155
It takes a lot of courage to say
what you said. I'm very proud of you.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.200
<i>And I want you to know that
I think you're doing very, very well...</i>

01:02:41.326 --> 01:02:43.328
<i>and I believe in you.</i>

01:02:43.453 --> 01:02:45.997
Yeah, she definitely
speaks to iguanas.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.375
<i>Okay. That's right.</i>

01:02:49.542 --> 01:02:52.879
<i>Call back on Monday
and we'll happily schedule you and Iggy.</i>

01:02:53.004 --> 01:02:56.007
Sure.
Mm-kay. Thank you.

01:02:57.675 --> 01:03:00.553
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnston, but Dr.
Markowski only takes appointments,

01:03:00.678 --> 01:03:03.264
and she's in a session right now.

01:03:03.389 --> 01:03:05.600
Is your animal friend with you?

01:03:05.725 --> 01:03:08.645
Uh, no, l-l-I don't have
an animal friend.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:12.482
I'm an old friend of Carm-
uh, Dr. Markowski's.

01:03:12.607 --> 01:03:14.943
Um, Carmen has
a really tight schedule.

01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:17.987
She may have a minute,
if you want to sit down.

01:03:18.112 --> 01:03:20.239
Yeah, okay.

01:04:23.928 --> 01:04:26.889
<i>No, no, no.
Of course I won't forget you, Cleo.</i>

01:04:28.266 --> 01:04:30.143
<i>Yes, I promise.</i>

01:04:30.268 --> 01:04:32.645
<i>Thank you, Dr. Markowski. Mm-hmm.</i>

01:04:32.812 --> 01:04:35.273
- Bye now.
- Bye, Cleo.

01:04:35.398 --> 01:04:37.317
See you next week, Mrs. Dorston.

01:04:47.118 --> 01:04:49.078
So, what do we have next?

01:04:56.628 --> 01:04:59.380
Don?

01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:09.932
So, you're an animal psychic?

01:05:10.058 --> 01:05:12.977
No.
I'm a communicator.

01:05:14.145 --> 01:05:16.481
And you're a doctor now?
Mmm.

01:05:18.066 --> 01:05:21.611
When we were together, you were so
passionate about becoming a lawyer.

01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:23.738
I mean, you were...

01:05:25.239 --> 01:05:27.116
very passionate.

01:05:27.241 --> 01:05:30.954
Yeah, well, passion's a funny thing.

01:05:33.081 --> 01:05:35.458
<i>I have a doctorate
in animal behavior.</i>

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:39.253
But that was sort of after the fact.

01:05:40.797 --> 01:05:42.757
It's an odd story.

01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:46.511
I'm getting into odd stories.

01:05:46.678 --> 01:05:50.139
Well, I was a very successful lawyer.

01:05:51.724 --> 01:05:54.143
I had no life, though,
outside my work,

01:05:54.268 --> 01:05:56.896
except for my dog, Winston.

01:05:59.274 --> 01:06:01.734
Your dog's named Winston?

01:06:02.902 --> 01:06:04.779
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:04.904 --> 01:06:06.781
<i>But then he died...</i>

01:06:06.906 --> 01:06:08.866
suddenly.

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:13.288
I'm sorry. Oh, no. It was, uh-

01:06:13.413 --> 01:06:15.331
It was years ago.

01:06:15.456 --> 01:06:18.710
But my new ability was this gift.

01:06:20.295 --> 01:06:22.213
This gift from Winston.

01:06:40.273 --> 01:06:42.859
All right, you can come in again.

01:06:48.323 --> 01:06:50.199
Anyway,

01:06:50.325 --> 01:06:53.119
<i>after Winston died I got this gift.</i>

01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:55.622
<i>To-</i>

01:06:55.747 --> 01:06:57.999
<i>To read animals' minds?
No. I told you-</i>

01:06:58.124 --> 01:07:01.419
- No.
- I'm a communicator.

01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:06.299
You see, soon after Winston died...

01:07:07.592 --> 01:07:11.095
I realized that I could
hear animals speak to me.

01:07:11.262 --> 01:07:15.767
I mean, I certainly hadn't
been aware of that before.

01:07:15.892 --> 01:07:17.977
And I don't read animals' minds.

01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:20.813
<i>But when they want to communicate,</i>

01:07:20.939 --> 01:07:23.441
<i>I can hear them.</i>

01:07:23.608 --> 01:07:26.069
You know, like you and I are talking.

01:07:26.194 --> 01:07:29.322
<i>But we don't read each other's minds.</i>

01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:36.537
Is he saying something?

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.590
He says you have a hidden agenda.

01:07:48.633 --> 01:07:52.261
He- He said that?

01:07:54.472 --> 01:07:56.891
I think you'd better
go back outside now, Ramon.

01:08:05.483 --> 01:08:07.318
<i>Animals can tell us what they want,</i>

01:08:07.443 --> 01:08:11.406
but that doesn't mean
that that's what's best for them.

01:08:14.826 --> 01:08:16.828
<i>Yes?</i>

01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:22.500
Excuse me, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo and
Skippy are here for your next session.

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:24.502
Oh. Okay.

01:08:24.627 --> 01:08:27.671
Um, give me one more minute.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.312
<i>Sorry, Don, but I really
can't keep Skippy waiting.</i>

01:08:42.437 --> 01:08:47.774
Do you think you could tell Skippy
that you're just gonna walk me to my car?

01:08:51.237 --> 01:08:54.115
How about later?
Wanna get a drink?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.117
No. I don't drink.

01:08:56.242 --> 01:08:58.118
Maybe get something to eat?

01:08:58.243 --> 01:09:01.080
I don't, uh, eat.

01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:04.876
You don't?

01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:07.879
Uh, take a walk?

01:09:08.046 --> 01:09:10.923
I know you walk.
I don't feel like it.

01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:16.554
Do you have a typewriter?

01:09:16.679 --> 01:09:18.640
A typewriter?

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.895
Are you married?

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:28.066
You know, I think you
should probably go now.

01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:30.151
Oh, come on, Carmen.

01:09:31.653 --> 01:09:33.821
Can't you answer me?
No.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.075
"No," you won't answer me?

01:09:37.241 --> 01:09:40.662
No, I'm not married.

01:09:42.747 --> 01:09:44.707
I was though.

01:09:46.626 --> 01:09:48.836
Any kids?

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.383
Yes.

01:09:55.051 --> 01:09:58.012
<i>I have a daughter, Lianna.
She's 16.</i>

01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:02.016
She's in Sweden.

01:10:02.141 --> 01:10:04.185
Sweden.

01:10:04.352 --> 01:10:06.688
Am I supposed to ask about you?

01:10:06.813 --> 01:10:09.732
<i>It seems like I've told you
my whole life story.</i>

01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:11.734
<i>So-
Me? No.</i>

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:13.736
I'm not married.

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.780
<i>Of course you aren't.</i>

01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:20.493
And I don't have any kids.

01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:22.578
Do I?

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.750
How would I know that?

01:10:29.127 --> 01:10:32.672
Sorry, Carmen, but Mr. Renaldo and Skippy
have been waiting in the session room.

01:10:32.797 --> 01:10:35.133
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.

01:10:35.258 --> 01:10:37.218
Okay.

01:10:44.058 --> 01:10:47.270
Well, my time is really up.

01:10:47.395 --> 01:10:50.565
So, good-bye.

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:52.692
<i>Bye, Carmen.</i>

01:11:14.172 --> 01:11:17.717
<i>Mr. Johnston?
You forgot your flowers.</i>

01:14:28.741 --> 01:14:31.286
Hey. Excuse me!
Excuse me.

01:14:33.454 --> 01:14:37.250
Excuse me. Uh, do you know
where Atwood Road is?

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:39.961
I'm lost.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.541
Oh!

01:16:00.667 --> 01:16:03.544
<i>Hey.</i>

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:05.880
Hey, it's okay.

01:16:07.674 --> 01:16:09.634
It's okay.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:12.512
Can I help you?

01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:14.722
Does Penny live here?

01:16:14.847 --> 01:16:16.849
Who's askin'?

01:16:18.226 --> 01:16:22.730
I'm an old friend of Penny's.
Don. Don Johnston.

01:16:25.066 --> 01:16:28.528
She's in the house.
Go around there. A screen door.

01:16:28.653 --> 01:16:30.613
Thanks.

01:17:09.652 --> 01:17:11.613
Penny?

01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:24.459
Hello?

01:17:25.918 --> 01:17:28.421
- Penny?
- Yeah?

01:17:36.888 --> 01:17:38.806
Donny.

01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:48.942
<i>So, what the fuck do you want, Donny?</i>

01:17:49.067 --> 01:17:53.237
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by.

01:17:53.363 --> 01:17:55.323
Just checking in.

01:17:58.451 --> 01:18:01.579
Well, I don't remember any
happy ending between us, Don.

01:18:01.704 --> 01:18:05.625
No... reconciliation, nothing.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:08.336
<i>You left me, Penny.
Remember?</i>

01:18:08.461 --> 01:18:10.880
Yeah.

01:18:11.005 --> 01:18:12.966
Very clearly.

01:18:15.843 --> 01:18:18.763
So, what is it you wanted?

01:18:18.888 --> 01:18:20.932
Everything okay over there, Pen?

01:18:22.809 --> 01:18:24.686
Not sure yet!

01:18:25.728 --> 01:18:27.689
Goddamn it.

01:18:28.815 --> 01:18:31.150
What is it you wanted?

01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:36.698
Penny, do you-

01:18:38.199 --> 01:18:40.159
Do you have a son?

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:49.210
Fuck you, Donny!

01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:59.804
Danny, grab that fucker.

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:05.768
<i>Penny!</i>

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:10.064
Shut up.

01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:12.150
I didn't say anything.

01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:36.090
What the hell's your fuckin' problem?
I was just leaving.

01:19:36.215 --> 01:19:39.510
No, what are you doing upsetting Penny like
that, huh? I just needed to ask her a question.

01:19:39.636 --> 01:19:42.555
Yeah, I know you asked her a question.
Now, listen.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.601
I just don't think
it's very sensitive of you...

01:19:46.726 --> 01:19:49.646
comin' out here
to try to hurt Penny's feelings,

01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:53.358
you know,
to get back at her or whatever.

01:19:56.194 --> 01:19:58.071
That just seems so rude.

01:22:24.384 --> 01:22:26.052
You said all pink, right?

01:22:26.177 --> 01:22:29.597
<i>It's best that they're all pink, yeah.</i>

01:22:35.478 --> 01:22:37.355
Oh, you're very good at this.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.525
That's beautiful.
Thanks.

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.527
Are you okay?

01:22:42.652 --> 01:22:46.531
Uh, it was just
a minor misunderstanding.

01:22:46.656 --> 01:22:49.492
Mind if I take a look?

01:22:53.663 --> 01:22:55.957
<i>Oh. That's nasty.</i>

01:22:56.124 --> 01:22:58.501
Did you even wash it?

01:22:58.626 --> 01:23:01.129
Sort of.

01:23:02.213 --> 01:23:04.132
Let me take care of it.

01:23:17.395 --> 01:23:19.272
What's your name?

01:23:19.397 --> 01:23:22.191
Sun. Sun Green.

01:23:22.317 --> 01:23:24.485
Sun Green?

01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:26.529
Perfect.

01:23:26.654 --> 01:23:28.531
What's yours?

01:23:28.656 --> 01:23:30.533
Don.
Don Johnston.

01:23:30.658 --> 01:23:32.660
Really?

01:23:32.785 --> 01:23:35.538
<i>Don Johnson?
Johnston.</i>

01:23:35.663 --> 01:23:37.624
With a "T."

01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:41.836
So...

01:23:46.132 --> 01:23:48.968
if I continue down this road,

01:23:49.135 --> 01:23:51.763
I will find the Riverview Cemetery?

01:23:51.888 --> 01:23:56.059
Yeah. You just go down the hill.
You'll see the entrance on your right.

01:24:02.523 --> 01:24:04.651
Thank you, Sun Green.

01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:06.736
You're welcome.

01:24:34.681 --> 01:24:36.641
Hello, beautiful.

01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:45.752
Red ink on pink paper.

01:26:17.617 --> 01:26:19.744
I don't know what I want.

01:26:19.869 --> 01:26:21.955
<i>He says you have a hidden agenda.</i>

01:26:22.121 --> 01:26:24.040
Fuck you, Donny.

01:27:24.183 --> 01:27:26.603
Circle Drive, please.
No rush.

01:28:11.773 --> 01:28:15.234
The wheel of fortune turns.
Round and round it goes.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.445
Where it stops, no one knows.

01:28:22.408 --> 01:28:24.369
Boy.

01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:21.009
That's my report, Sherlock.

01:29:21.134 --> 01:29:24.095
The general outline
of what you put me through.

01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:27.515
That's it?

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.978
And after all that, you're still no closer
to knowing who's the mother of your son?

01:29:32.145 --> 01:29:34.105
That's right.

01:29:35.356 --> 01:29:37.775
But there was that one typewriter.

01:29:37.942 --> 01:29:40.361
And the pink motorcycle.

01:29:40.528 --> 01:29:43.406
And it was Dora's pink,
uh, business card.

01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:45.700
And-And-And Laura's pink bathrobe.

01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:49.203
I think this whole thing
is a farce, a fiasco.

01:29:50.246 --> 01:29:52.332
As far as I know,

01:29:52.457 --> 01:29:54.876
you may have written
that letter to me.

01:29:58.254 --> 01:30:01.633
Look, I'm really sorry
that you got beat up and everything.

01:30:01.758 --> 01:30:05.970
I feel that it was somehow my fault.

01:30:06.095 --> 01:30:08.056
It was.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.894
Kind of strange, too, how, uh,

01:30:13.019 --> 01:30:15.980
Carmen's magic dog was named Winston.

01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:21.027
Yeah-

01:30:21.194 --> 01:30:24.280
Look, man, I really put
a lot of work into this thing.

01:30:24.405 --> 01:30:28.242
I thought that it was really important
that you know whether or not you had a son.

01:30:28.368 --> 01:30:31.621
I mean, it's your life.
You got to live your life, right?

01:30:31.746 --> 01:30:34.499
<i>I was living my life, Winston.</i>

01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:39.087
I still am.

01:30:39.212 --> 01:30:42.298
What's this?
It's pink.

01:30:42.423 --> 01:30:45.343
It's a note I found in
my foyer when I got back.

01:30:45.468 --> 01:30:48.513
Red ink on pink paper.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.473
It's from Sherry.

01:30:50.598 --> 01:30:52.475
What? From Sherry?

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.937
Why didn't you tell me?
May I see it?

01:30:56.062 --> 01:31:01.192
Envelope and paper
not exactly the same size.

01:31:03.319 --> 01:31:05.530
You know, the handwriting...

01:31:05.655 --> 01:31:09.617
seems pretty close to the address
on the envelope, but I can't be sure.

01:31:11.953 --> 01:31:13.955
Sherry still likes you.

01:31:16.582 --> 01:31:19.669
You think that Sherry
could have sent the first letter...

01:31:19.836 --> 01:31:23.006
and made the whole thing up
just to fuck with you?

01:31:23.131 --> 01:31:25.049
Who knows?

01:31:26.592 --> 01:31:28.469
You know, I've got to go.

01:31:28.594 --> 01:31:32.599
I think I have just enough time to stop
home and compare the handwriting...

01:31:32.724 --> 01:31:35.727
and then hopefully
punch in at work on time.

01:31:35.852 --> 01:31:38.730
You coming?
No.

01:31:39.939 --> 01:31:42.942
I just need a little break
from all of this.

01:31:43.985 --> 01:31:45.862
Look, don't worry.

01:31:45.987 --> 01:31:48.906
We're still going to
solve this mystery.

01:32:40.416 --> 01:32:43.294
Didn't I see you
at the airport last night?

01:32:43.419 --> 01:32:45.463
I don't know.
Did you?

01:32:45.588 --> 01:32:47.465
Yeah.

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:49.759
You on a road trip?

01:32:49.884 --> 01:32:51.844
Yeah.
Something like that.

01:32:55.556 --> 01:32:58.434
You look hungry.
Can I buy you a sandwich or something?

01:32:58.559 --> 01:33:00.436
Uh, no, that's okay.

01:33:00.561 --> 01:33:03.856
You can relax.
I'm not gay. I'm not a cop.

01:33:03.982 --> 01:33:07.026
Just a guy who sees a guy
who might need a sandwich.

01:33:09.362 --> 01:33:11.406
Okay. Thanks.

01:33:12.448 --> 01:33:15.326
But could you get something to go?
I'd sorta rather stay outside.

01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:17.328
Sure.

01:33:17.495 --> 01:33:19.539
How about a nice club sandwich?

01:33:19.664 --> 01:33:21.624
I'm vegetarian.

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:24.794
You eat cheese?

01:33:24.919 --> 01:33:27.672
Yeah, sometimes.
I like cheese.

01:33:29.048 --> 01:33:31.509
Okay, I got it.
I'll be right back.

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.777
Thanks.
You're welcome.

01:34:20.558 --> 01:34:22.518
Hey.

01:34:23.645 --> 01:34:26.356
You found us a place.

01:34:26.481 --> 01:34:28.566
All right.

01:34:31.903 --> 01:34:34.113
Let's see here.

01:34:34.238 --> 01:34:37.033
Big cheese and veggie sandwich...

01:34:37.158 --> 01:34:39.118
with mushrooms.

01:34:40.995 --> 01:34:42.914
Fries-
Mmm.

01:34:43.039 --> 01:34:44.999
extra large.

01:34:48.586 --> 01:34:50.588
Two waters.

01:34:53.466 --> 01:34:55.426
Two coffees.

01:35:04.018 --> 01:35:06.688
My mom put that there...

01:35:06.854 --> 01:35:08.773
<i>for good luck.</i>

01:35:13.444 --> 01:35:15.780
Thanks for the food.

01:35:15.905 --> 01:35:18.199
Ahh.
No problem, chief.

01:35:22.578 --> 01:35:24.539
You called me chief?

01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:28.918
Yeah. Why?

01:35:34.716 --> 01:35:36.676
What happened to your eye?

01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:40.471
I, uh-

01:35:42.307 --> 01:35:44.684
I ran into somebody.

01:35:44.851 --> 01:35:47.270
Somebody's fist.

01:35:49.105 --> 01:35:52.025
You a gangster?

01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:54.027
No. I wish.

01:35:54.152 --> 01:35:57.780
No, I was, uh- I was in computers.

01:35:59.449 --> 01:36:01.409
Computers and girls.

01:36:03.453 --> 01:36:05.330
What about you, chief?

01:36:05.455 --> 01:36:08.499
I'm interested in, uh, philosophy.

01:36:10.793 --> 01:36:12.754
Philosophy and girls.

01:36:16.883 --> 01:36:18.843
Sounds pretty good.

01:36:20.094 --> 01:36:22.513
Think so?

01:36:29.187 --> 01:36:31.189
So, uh,

01:36:32.857 --> 01:36:36.861
as just a guy
who gave another guy a sandwich,

01:36:39.572 --> 01:36:44.035
you have any, like,
philosophical tips or anything...

01:36:45.787 --> 01:36:48.915
for a guy on a kind of road trip?

01:36:49.999 --> 01:36:52.460
You asking me?

01:36:54.087 --> 01:36:56.005
Yeah.

01:36:57.173 --> 01:36:59.092
Well-

01:37:02.512 --> 01:37:05.265
The past is gone.

01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:07.392
I know that.

01:37:08.726 --> 01:37:11.354
The future...

01:37:11.479 --> 01:37:13.523
isn't here yet,

01:37:13.648 --> 01:37:15.608
whatever it's going to be.

01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:19.028
So,

01:37:19.153 --> 01:37:23.241
all there is is- is this.

01:37:24.701 --> 01:37:26.619
The present.

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.585
That's it.

01:37:36.921 --> 01:37:38.923
Are you a Buddhist?

01:37:40.967 --> 01:37:42.969
No. Are you?

01:37:44.512 --> 01:37:46.472
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

01:37:47.932 --> 01:37:52.270
I'm sorry that's the best
I have to offer at the moment.

01:37:52.395 --> 01:37:54.355
No, I appreciate it.

01:37:55.523 --> 01:37:58.026
I like what you said.

01:37:59.277 --> 01:38:02.614
It's better than some, like,

01:38:02.739 --> 01:38:04.866
fatherly-sounding bullshit.

01:38:08.286 --> 01:38:10.121
Is that...

01:38:10.246 --> 01:38:12.373
what your father's like?

01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:22.508
Ah, that's not a good subject.

01:38:22.634 --> 01:38:25.511
Hey, I gotta go, man.
I'm sorry.

01:38:25.637 --> 01:38:28.222
Thanks again
for the sandwich and stuff.

01:38:28.348 --> 01:38:30.308
Hold on a second.
Wait.

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:36.314
I know you think
that I'm your father, don't you?

01:38:38.566 --> 01:38:41.903
What? Just tell me.
You can talk to me, chief.

01:38:42.028 --> 01:38:44.280
Man, you're fucked up.

01:38:44.405 --> 01:38:47.075
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Wait!
