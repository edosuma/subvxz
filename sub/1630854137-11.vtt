00:04.221 --> 00:06.180
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:09.792
<i>are considered
especially heinous.</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.843
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:20.846
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:22.196 --> 00:24.589
Noah, call the police.

00:24.589 --> 00:29.072
<i>I was with my son, and a gang
came after me with a machete.</i>

00:29.072 --> 00:30.552
You all right?

00:30.552 --> 00:32.510
I will be once I get
my hands on Oscar Papa.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.077
<i>Well, I got a call
under Bronx Gangs.</i>

00:34.077 --> 00:36.079
<i>You call Duarte.</i>

00:36.079 --> 00:37.646
<i>He's our expert on BX9.</i>

00:37.646 --> 00:39.952
Are you saying you wanna
liaise with me?

00:39.952 --> 00:42.520
If you think that
you can separate

00:42.520 --> 00:45.741
the gang problem from the
rape problem up there,

00:45.741 --> 00:48.309
I would like to see you try.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.702
<i>SVU Bronx needs
a new squad now.</i>

00:50.702 --> 00:52.835
I don't have the authority
to hire anybody.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.359
You and Bruno
should be vetting them.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.318
While you go
after Oscar Papa?

00:57.318 --> 00:58.667
It's the reason
that I came up here.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.191
<i>The kid that I shot
just got out of surgery.</i>

01:02.714 --> 01:04.673
Remember me?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.633
You're that white lady
who shot me.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.157
You're lucky
it wasn't your head.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.681
Would have
been doing me a favor.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.204
If you're worried
about retaliation--

01:14.204 --> 01:15.727
We have armed guards
in the hall.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.730
I don't care
what happens to me.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.167
My whole life's a mess.

01:20.167 --> 01:23.257
So why don't you let us
help you clean it up?

01:24.867 --> 01:26.434
What do you want from me?

01:26.434 --> 01:30.351
I want confirmation
that Oscar Papa is the one

01:30.351 --> 01:32.309
who put the hit out on me.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.832
You know I can't do that.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.879
You're protecting a guy
that thinks you're disposable.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.329
Is he talking smack about me?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.854
What'd he say?

01:55.854 --> 01:57.117
Nothing bad.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.255
How old are you?

02:06.996 --> 02:08.171
I'm 15.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.699
Oh.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.400
How did you get involved
in BX9?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.272
I came up on La Bestia.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.969
The beast.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.362
Train from Chiapas.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.756
I walked from El Salvador,

02:27.756 --> 02:30.454
climbed up on the train
one night.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.805
We rode the roof
for thousands of miles.

02:33.805 --> 02:34.980
We?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.286
It was so cold.

02:36.286 --> 02:39.768
Me and some stranger
huddled together.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.991
He taught me to look up
at the stars.

02:45.991 --> 02:50.735
I liked those three
little ones all in a row.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.954
Orion's Belt.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.175
That makes sense.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.962
Why'd you come to New York?

02:59.962 --> 03:02.312
I was looking for my moms.

03:02.312 --> 03:05.228
She came to New York
when I was ten to work.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.360
Did you find her?

03:09.319 --> 03:11.321
She didn't want nothing
to do with my ass.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.454
And why is that?

03:13.454 --> 03:14.890
Why do you think?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.674
BX9.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.419
They raped her,
threatened to do it again

03:22.419 --> 03:23.986
if I didn't soldier up.

03:25.727 --> 03:30.210
I told you, you should have
just shot me in the head.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.870
- The kid give you anything?
- Not yet.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.045
We're working him.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.438
Working him.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.266
Just a little bit
of empathy, Duarte?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
You wanna hug that kid
in there, fine,

03:44.615 --> 03:47.227
but do it after
I solve my case.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.750
- Your case?
- Yeah.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.360
The one McGrath
told me to solve.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.362
All due respect,
you're still the victim here.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.451
Little bastard did try
and chop you up, Captain.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.366
Imagine if you hadn't
been packing extra heat

03:56.366 --> 03:57.976
in those designer shoes
of yours.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.065
Okay, look, I'm flattered
that you two wanna protect me

04:00.065 --> 04:03.199
from what seems like
self-sabotaging denial,

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
but my first order
of business here

04:05.245 --> 04:07.769
is to reconnect Fugazi
with his mother.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.553
If you want, Captain, I can
take Muncy and go find her.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.252
That's exactly what I want.

04:15.124 --> 04:18.562
I see what you're doing, your
little ploy to flip that kid.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.869
- That boy needs his mother.
- If you say so.

04:20.869 --> 04:25.743
BX9 raped his mother
to force him into that gang.

04:25.743 --> 04:29.007
He is a victim
just like his mother,

04:29.007 --> 04:30.226
and she needs to know that.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.793
I told you.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.056
This gang stuff is a lot more
complicated than you think.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.276
Is this about the apology
that you think I owe you?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.842
I don't want your apology.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.584
Not yet.
- No, you wanna savor it.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.760
With a nice glass
of Cabernet.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.066
That's still your drink,
isn't it?

04:44.066 --> 04:46.547
That's not happening, Duarte.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.549
That's not happening
until whoever

04:48.549 --> 04:50.377
greenlit me is behind bars.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.075
Well, that might happen
sooner than you think.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.338
Let's take a drive.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.384
I wanna show you something.

05:04.782 --> 05:07.219
I should have worn
my hiking boots.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.482
We're almost there.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.930
Oh, God.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.976
Enough, Duarte.

05:24.976 --> 05:28.850
Please tell me this is not
what I think it is.

05:28.850 --> 05:33.376
Not the first time rape has
been used as a weapon of war.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.770
Just happens to be a gang war.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.645
BX9 put this here.

05:41.645 --> 05:45.823
Kids like Fugazi,
Sabo, Ricky, Sleep,

05:45.823 --> 05:47.564
they come up from South
and Central America

05:47.564 --> 05:49.610
thinking they escaped
the gang problem.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.395
But they didn't.

05:52.395 --> 05:56.268
The first day of school in
New York, they're approached.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.097
And they say no once.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.926
But no one ever says no
to BX9 a second time.

06:04.059 --> 06:08.542
Because this is what happens
to their mothers if they do.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.959
We got Ronnie Samuels
for the murder of Renee Perry.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.961
It's about
12 rape cases clear.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.353
Don't get ahead of yourself.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.920
Ronnie still has
to go to trial.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.661
Well, for now,
let's just pretend

07:24.661 --> 07:25.923
this little stack is cleared.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.490
That mean you guys
are leaving now?

07:27.490 --> 07:29.623
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to get rid of us.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.407
It's gonna take a lot more
than me, a D-3,

07:31.407 --> 07:34.105
and a white shield
to get these cases cleared.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.846
Well, as part of
our federal mandate,

07:35.846 --> 07:38.414
we've been given broad latitude
to hire new detectives.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.937
A full squad's worth.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.461
That's great,
but who's gonna vet them?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.115
According to McGrath, that's
what Benson's here to do.

07:44.115 --> 07:47.597
Speaking of which,
where the hell is she?

07:47.597 --> 07:48.990
She'll be back.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.428
Well, until then,
you're an SVU sergeant.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.169
Over two decades
under your belt?

07:54.169 --> 07:56.519
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.694
Start here.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.528
Don't look at me.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.360
Who is she, some kind
of velvet house cat?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.622
Hardly.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.841
Churlish may be low
on the totem,

08:13.841 --> 08:15.712
but she's got her sights
set high.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.845
Guys around here used
to call her the Mayor.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.803
She's gonna be both
our bosses one day.

08:19.803 --> 08:23.198
I'll keep that in mind.

08:23.198 --> 08:26.680
I want every single pair
of underwear cataloged

08:26.680 --> 08:28.029
and processed for DNA.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.770
There's gotta
be over 100 pairs.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.685
And every one of them
is evidence.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.338
A rape tree?

08:33.338 --> 08:35.297
I prefer to call it what
it is, a recruitment tool.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.429
How long did you
know about this?

08:37.429 --> 08:38.866
A year, year and a half.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.998
Oh, you knew about this
for a year?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.347
You knew about this
the whole time,

08:42.347 --> 08:43.697
and you didn't tell me?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:43.697 --> 08:45.220
The whole time I was working
with you?

08:45.220 --> 08:46.874
- What, do you not trust me?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:46.874 --> 08:48.266
- I don't trust anyone.
- Calm down. Muncy, calm down.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.398
Take a second.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.008
Are you kidding me, Duarte?

08:51.008 --> 08:54.272
You knew about this.
- Listen...

08:54.272 --> 08:57.885
Duarte, she worked with the
women from this neighborhood.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.887
You've been sitting on this
for a year and a half?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.410
I don't even know how
you're standing here,

09:01.410 --> 09:03.194
but I gotta tell you,
this makes you just as bad

09:03.194 --> 09:05.022
as the men
who use this to recruit.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.329
I was trying to get a
surveillance op off the ground.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.026
It's not like Bronx SVU
was any help.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.072
Oh, yeah, well,
now everybody's gonna know.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.074
'Cause neighborhoods like this,

09:13.074 --> 09:14.728
gossip travels
at the speed of sound.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.599
He's right--there goes
your surveillance op.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.341
Well, now that you're here,
we don't need it anymore.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.604
You were attacked by the
only witness that matters.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.171
Who, Fugazi?

09:23.171 --> 09:25.739
He was shown this tree,
brought here by the recruiters.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.044
He can ID them.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.742
So you wanna
bring him back here

09:28.742 --> 09:30.657
so we can traumatize him
a second time?

09:30.657 --> 09:31.962
If putting him back
in touch with his mother

09:31.962 --> 09:33.790
doesn't do it first, yeah.

09:33.790 --> 09:37.098
Thank you, Captain Duarte,
but your presence

09:37.098 --> 09:40.623
in what is now a sprawling
sexual assault case

09:40.623 --> 09:43.321
is no longer needed or wanted.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.454
You're the victim
in a gang crime, which,

09:45.454 --> 09:47.891
might I remind you,
has its roots in my borough.

09:52.896 --> 09:56.421
I'll get McGrath involved
in this if I have to.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.642
But let me assure you
that from here on out,

09:59.642 --> 10:00.861
we're doing this my way.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.514
Which means what?

10:02.514 --> 10:05.256
Reading bedtime stories to the
kid that tried to chop you up?

10:07.432 --> 10:10.871
We're gonna try to ID
as many rape victims as we can

10:10.871 --> 10:14.657
who will undoubtedly point us
to the same recruiters

10:14.657 --> 10:16.659
that you claim to be after.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.487
You mean the same women that
have been silent for years?

10:18.487 --> 10:20.315
Yeah, we're gonna
convince them to talk,

10:20.315 --> 10:22.404
and it's gonna get us to
Oscar Papa, same way as yours.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.014
My way's faster.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.190
You're talking about changing
the way a neighborhood works.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.453
I'm talking about putting
the screws to one kid.

10:28.453 --> 10:33.371
One kid--and retraumatize him
more than he's already been.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.808
Captain.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.505
I'm talking to her, not you.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.246
I'm gonna go to my
old girl gang contacts,

10:38.246 --> 10:39.639
see if we can find
Fugazi's mom.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.728
Maybe one of them knows
who the recruiters are.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.382
All right,
that's a good place to start.

10:44.382 --> 10:47.168
Velasco, I want you
back at Bronx SVU.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.605
I want you to have the Feds
expedite the DNA

10:49.605 --> 10:52.608
from this tree and have
Fin and Churlish and Bruno

10:52.608 --> 10:54.392
help you make the IDs.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.527
Chief.
- Captain.

10:58.527 --> 11:03.140
Yeah, I just got a call from
Avital and Wise over at DOJ.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.794
They're wondering
where you're at.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.361
<i>Well, do you
really wanna know?</i>

11:06.361 --> 11:09.538
<i>Well, officially no,
but even Fin can't lie</i>

11:09.538 --> 11:11.061
<i>to U.S. attorneys forever.</i>

11:11.061 --> 11:15.500
Look, you sent me up to the
Bronx to close open cases,

11:15.500 --> 11:18.286
not to go to war
with Oscar Papa.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.985
We may have just stumbled
on a way to do both.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.949
Jesus, what am--
what am I looking at?

11:28.949 --> 11:31.560
<i>100 or so open rapes.</i>

11:31.560 --> 11:32.866
Ah, jeez.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.650
What, are you out of your mind?

11:34.650 --> 11:39.481
Perpetrated by known
BX9 recruiters against women

11:39.481 --> 11:44.051
and children whose cases
are no doubt languishing

11:44.051 --> 11:47.054
<i>in Bronx SVU's open pile.</i>

11:47.054 --> 11:50.753
Well, that's
a coincidence, isn't it?

11:50.753 --> 11:51.754
<i>No.</i>

11:51.754 --> 11:53.451
No, it isn't.

11:53.451 --> 11:57.804
Look, gang violence
is sexual violence.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.937
We all learned that this past
summer with the subway case.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
<i>So if these cases are open,</i>

12:02.460 --> 12:03.853
that means you're gonna
close them, right?

12:03.853 --> 12:05.725
<i>It's a pretty good way
to get the DOJ</i>

12:05.725 --> 12:07.378
<i>off your back, isn't it?</i>

12:07.378 --> 12:09.119
What, so this is about me,
about my image?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.208
Not about you chasing down
Oscar Papa?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.558
- I didn't say that.
- Wow.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.996
Well, at least you and Duarte
are finally on the same page.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.956
I didn't say that, either.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.306
I gotta go.

12:23.786 --> 12:24.874
And--

12:29.487 --> 12:32.229
This must be the end of
the line for the free donuts.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.709
Feds asked Fin and Bruno
to put together

12:33.709 --> 12:35.580
a new Bronx SVU squad.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.886
DOJ's leaving?

12:36.886 --> 12:38.932
Not yet, but they agreed
to expedite DNA

12:38.932 --> 12:41.151
from that tree you guys found.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.023
Maria.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.938
You'll meet up with us?

12:44.938 --> 12:46.896
Great. I'll see you there.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.553
- One of your contacts?
- Yeah, Maria Garcia.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.120
I got her a job
at the dollar store.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.295
Went to go talk to her,

12:54.295 --> 12:55.775
some guy came in
and she clammed up,

12:55.775 --> 12:57.515
but I could tell there was
more she wanted to say.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.648
Well, sometimes silence
says it all.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.303
It turns out she was raped by
two guys in the Tremont clique

13:02.303 --> 13:05.306
last year right before her
brother got jumped into BX9.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.655
What happened with her case?

13:06.655 --> 13:07.787
She withdrew.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.224
Jesus.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.965
Why is she so willing
to talk now?

13:13.967 --> 13:16.099
Because her brother Rodrigo
got mowed down

13:16.099 --> 13:18.754
a few weeks ago by 19th Street.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.539
I hate to be the beneficiary
of bad luck, but...

13:25.805 --> 13:26.893
Yeah.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.506
What happened to my brother
is a tragedy.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.638
Yeah, your parents came here
for a better life.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.597
Yeah, they weren't expecting
to lose their son.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.817
We're so sorry about what
happened to your brother,

13:37.817 --> 13:42.517
Rodrigo, but there may be a way
to get justice for both of you.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.171
No.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.304
I told you, I'll talk about
what happened in private.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.871
She doesn't wanna speak
in court.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.004
And why not?

13:51.004 --> 13:53.789
My parents don't know
what happened to me.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.791
In their minds, my brother
is still a good kid.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.358
I'd rather keep it that way.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.886
Did Rodrigo ever
mention this tree?

14:08.717 --> 14:10.414
No.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.938
But you remember
the circumstances

14:11.938 --> 14:13.896
around your brother
joining BX9.

14:15.637 --> 14:19.380
The day he turned 13,
Rodrigo came home upset.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.903
Me and my mother
asked what happened.

14:20.903 --> 14:25.038
He said he was approached
by BX9 at school.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.040
Muncy said that
your brother was

14:27.040 --> 14:30.652
a really sweet kid, a good boy.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.914
He liked comic books.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.220
He had a kitten he loved.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.527
He said no to them at first.

14:36.527 --> 14:40.618
And then, one night,
I was leaving work.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
Hey.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.450
No one is gonna know
you talked to us.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.018
Okay, I promise.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.977
It's okay.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.240
Go on.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.546
Two guys were waiting
in the backseat of my car

14:55.546 --> 14:59.159
when I got in to drive
to my boyfriend's house.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.726
They surprised me.

15:01.726 --> 15:05.600
And when they were done,
they stole...

15:05.600 --> 15:07.776
more than just my smile.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.439
Are you saying one
of those is mine?

15:18.439 --> 15:23.139
BX9 uses rape
to recruit members.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.404
Rodrigo joined
the gang that night.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.885
Do you know who
recruited him, Maria?

15:29.885 --> 15:31.669
The same guys who raped me.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.672
We're gonna need
their names.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.983
And no one will know
that you talked to us.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.158
We promise.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.903
We're looking
for Lindsay Del Toro, age 28,

15:47.903 --> 15:52.125
street name Bug Bear,
and Hector Suarez, age 27,

15:52.125 --> 15:55.084
street name Sacrilege.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.478
- Sacrilege?
- Yeah.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.045
From what I hear,
he robbed a church.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.657
Adorable.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.157
This way.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.465
No, don't move!

16:28.465 --> 16:30.250
Muncy, he's going out the back!

16:30.250 --> 16:31.903
Let me see your hands!

16:31.903 --> 16:33.383
Go, go!
Let me see your hands!

16:33.383 --> 16:34.906
Yo, okay, all right!

16:34.906 --> 16:36.169
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:36.169 --> 16:38.127
It's meant to kill grizzlies.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.694
Drop it!

16:41.957 --> 16:43.437
- NYPD!
- Oh, okay!

16:43.437 --> 16:45.178
- Hands up!
- Okay, bud!

16:45.178 --> 16:47.136
No sudden moves,
just stay put.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.573
I think I messed myself.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.193
Thanks.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.117
You Mirandize this guy?

17:11.117 --> 17:12.466
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.641
He just wanted dry pants.

17:13.641 --> 17:14.946
Do I wanna know why?

17:14.946 --> 17:16.296
Not really.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.559
What about his buddy,
the one Duarte shot?

17:18.559 --> 17:19.995
At the hospital.

17:19.995 --> 17:22.650
But he was wearing a vest,
so alive, unfortunately.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.826
This guy doesn't need
to know that.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.001
Wanna take a run at him?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.090
Sure, why not?

17:28.090 --> 17:30.179
Age before beauty.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.007
You first, moneybags.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.274
I'm Sergeant Tutuola.
This is Detective Bruno.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.667
How you doing, Lindsay?

17:39.667 --> 17:40.929
Nobody calls me that.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.539
You're not Bug Bear here, son.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.193
And trust me,
you don't wanna be.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.325
I didn't do nothing.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.804
You ran from the cops.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.719
We didn't know they was cops.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.808
Thought it was a rip crew
coming to rob us.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.942
That why your buddy
pulled his grizzly gun?

17:53.942 --> 17:55.944
Self-defense.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.468
Kinda had the opposite effect.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.125
What you mean?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.258
How do I say this?

18:05.258 --> 18:06.694
You boy Hector's dead.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.917
Now, what I wanna know is,

18:12.917 --> 18:15.572
what your crew gonna say
when they find out that you ran

18:15.572 --> 18:18.271
and left him to die.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.664
We can put that word
on the street real easy, huh?

18:20.664 --> 18:21.839
Yeah.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.280
Unless you give us who told you
to start using rape

18:27.280 --> 18:29.195
as a recruitment tool.

18:34.243 --> 18:35.549
How's Amanda?

18:35.549 --> 18:37.072
She's grading papers.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.161
You know what that means?
No machetes, no black eyes.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.076
Yeah, but paper cuts
are a bitch.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.686
Speaking of paper,
your boy Duarte is gonna be

18:42.686 --> 18:44.166
buried under some, huh?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.516
Yeah, I'm talking to FID
about it right now.

18:46.516 --> 18:50.172
Look, he's gonna be fine
despite having a grizzly gun

18:50.172 --> 18:51.304
aimed at his vest.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.044
Would have ripped
right through that.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.959
And the next five
apartment buildings.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.874
I hear Duarte shot the perp
who robbed Saint Anne's.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.659
As a practicing Catholic,
let me thank you both.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.617
What do you need from me?

19:00.617 --> 19:02.663
Multiple blood
warrants for DNA

19:02.663 --> 19:06.145
on whoever he and his friend
will flip on,

19:06.145 --> 19:09.060
ideally Oscar Papa.
- Well, he's elusive.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.845
He could be
in San Salvador by now.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.977
That's the bastard
who raped my mother!

19:12.977 --> 19:15.415
I'll kill you! Let go of me!

19:15.415 --> 19:17.112
Let go of me!

19:17.112 --> 19:19.201
I'm gonna kill him!
I'll kill you!

19:19.201 --> 19:21.986
You disrespect my mom,
I'll kill you!

19:21.986 --> 19:23.205
Disrespect my mom!
- Hey.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.686
- I'll kill you!
- You think it's funny?

19:25.686 --> 19:27.209
I don't even
remember his mom, so--

19:27.209 --> 19:29.820
You know, we found
your rape tree, dumbass.

19:32.519 --> 19:36.175
And the Feds are combing
through it as we speak.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.005
You don't think they're
gonna find your DNA on it?

19:42.964 --> 19:45.749
I want a lawyer.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.056
I bet you do.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.016
Looks like you wasted
a trip, Counselor.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.627
What about that kid
you shot, Fugazi?

19:53.627 --> 19:54.671
You think he'd be willing
to talk to us?

19:54.671 --> 19:56.020
You mean Albert Diaz.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.152
Let's just call him the kid
who attacked you

19:57.152 --> 19:58.458
with a machete
from now on, okay?

19:58.458 --> 19:59.807
He's a child.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.156
So what?

20:01.156 --> 20:02.853
Well, he's also a gangbanger,

20:02.853 --> 20:04.986
so he's not the most
reliable witness.

20:04.986 --> 20:08.685
Yeah, but he did just
make a de facto positive ID.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.252
He's on painkillers, right?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.341
So you wanna fight
that battle in court?

20:12.341 --> 20:13.995
Well, I'll get the nurse
to put him on non-narcotics.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.779
Well, I'd prefer
not to, okay?

20:15.779 --> 20:17.651
He's in pain,

20:17.651 --> 20:19.043
he's unaccompanied,
and he's scared.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.263
Who's the victim here,
you or him?

20:21.263 --> 20:22.743
Look, we're not in court, Counselor,

20:22.743 --> 20:24.266
so how about you not
cross-examine me?

20:24.266 --> 20:26.790
Okay, well, then,
as your friend,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.618
you're protecting this kid.

20:28.618 --> 20:29.663
Why?

20:34.450 --> 20:37.410
So we've made major inroads
on the Tremont clique,

20:37.410 --> 20:40.282
but the only way to
dismantle this group

20:40.282 --> 20:42.545
is to take down our
new favorite person.

20:42.545 --> 20:43.851
Oscar Papa.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.853
So what do we have so far?

20:45.853 --> 20:48.856
Lindsay Del Toro,
aka Bug Bear.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.119
He copped
to his boy Sacrilege

20:51.119 --> 20:53.121
using that tree you found
as a recruitment tool.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.731
How did you get him
to do that?

20:54.731 --> 20:55.863
We told him
we'd tell his crew

20:55.863 --> 20:57.343
he ran from the police raid.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.693
So you lied to get
the confession out of him?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.216
It's not technically illegal,

21:01.216 --> 21:03.305
but his lawyer
could make it seem coerced.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.959
Well, it's not
our finest police work,

21:04.959 --> 21:06.656
but it did put some of our
new Bronx SVU candidates

21:06.656 --> 21:07.962
to the test.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.355
And with their help,
we managed to link

21:09.355 --> 21:13.402
upwards of 20 open rape cases
directly to BX9.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.012
And Muncy has another one.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.364
- Here it is.
- Who's she?

21:18.364 --> 21:19.756
A contact of mine.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.541
She ID'd both Bug Bear
and Sacrilege

21:21.541 --> 21:22.890
as the two guys who raped her.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.108
Did she report it?

21:24.108 --> 21:26.110
Over a year ago
and then pulled it,

21:26.110 --> 21:28.243
and they never followed up.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.636
But she did ID a garment
of hers in the tree.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.681
That's a good start.
Can we get her to testify?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.335
So far, no.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.381
So what do we actually
have that substantiates

21:35.381 --> 21:36.904
arresting Oscar Papa?

21:36.904 --> 21:38.906
A whole lot of nothing.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.212
Even worse.
Something gonna waste.

21:44.738 --> 21:45.913
Churlish.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.395
Do you have something
you wanna say?

21:51.222 --> 21:54.008
A direct order
to greenlight an NYPD captain

21:54.008 --> 21:56.619
might not be a bad thing
to have in our back pocket.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.146
What do you say, Captain?

22:02.146 --> 22:05.280
Let's go rattle
that banger you shot.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.065
It's not like we have
any other viable leads.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.502
You know what they say, Liv.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.286
If three people tell you
you're drunk, you're drunk.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.983
Point taken.

22:12.983 --> 22:16.291
Muncy, any luck finding
the boy's mother?

22:16.291 --> 22:18.293
Yes, she's a seamstress
at a shop not far from here.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.513
Me and Churlish,
we're gonna go there next.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.123
Okay. Pick her up.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.038
Meet me and Duarte
at the hospital.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.953
Visiting hours end at 5:00.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.399
Hey there.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.140
If you were in BX9,
you know what

22:39.140 --> 22:40.576
your street name would be?

22:40.576 --> 22:42.186
Aspirin--
'cause I get a headache

22:42.186 --> 22:43.405
every time you're around.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.928
Well, I'm basically a member

22:44.928 --> 22:46.626
since you and your buddies
jumped me in.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.018
Talk to us, Albert.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.846
This way, we don't have
to keep coming back.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.458
I already told you
everything I know.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.894
You're just here to use me
and throw me out,

22:53.894 --> 22:56.853
just like everyone else.
- That's not true.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.464
Look at me.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.422
You're not disposable anymore.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.859
- My life is over.
- Why?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.383
Because a monster
raped your mother?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.994
Albert, your life
is just starting.

23:06.994 --> 23:09.039
He was right there,
laughing at me.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.606
Sacrilege isn't gonna be
laughing like that for long.

23:10.606 --> 23:11.912
He's going to prison.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.609
And you're gonna help us
put him there.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.742
You wanna soldier up?

23:15.742 --> 23:18.005
This, this is how you do it.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.615
This is your chance
to be a hero.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.617
Yeah, a dead one.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.445
We can put you
in Witness Protection.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.316
You and your mother together.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.536
My moms? Are you stupid?

23:27.536 --> 23:31.105
I told you, she don't want
nothing to do with me.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.455
I'm not stupid, Albert.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.762
But I am a mother.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.982
And I know what
that kind of love is like.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.855
And it's a lot tougher
than you think.

23:41.855 --> 23:46.076
When you came to kill me
the other night,

23:46.076 --> 23:49.340
I would have died for my son.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.518
But I wanted to live
for him more.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.303
And that's what
your mother wanted to do,

23:55.303 --> 23:56.826
is live for you.

23:56.826 --> 23:59.089
And that's why she
couldn't be around.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.264
Your mom got hurt once.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.352
That's why she
had to stay away.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.746
No. No.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.488
What Captain Duarte
is trying to say

24:06.488 --> 24:08.751
is that she wanted to be there

24:08.751 --> 24:11.972
when you grew up,
when you got out.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.321
You don't know that!

24:13.321 --> 24:15.236
You two are just playing me
to get me to talk.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.672
She don't want me.

24:16.672 --> 24:20.154
Why don't we let her
be the judge of that?

24:24.767 --> 24:26.769
Albert.

24:26.769 --> 24:27.944
Mommy.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.123
I'm so sorry.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.477
He made me do it.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.133
<i>Maestro,</i> he forced me.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.396
He told me to kill her.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.188
Gotta hand it to you, Benson.

24:54.188 --> 24:57.321
This touchy feely stuff
is brutally effective.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.715
You think I was
playing the kid?

24:59.715 --> 25:03.589
Look, I did what I had to do
to give them a chance.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.895
That boy needs his mother.
- Either way, it worked.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.810
All we gotta do now
is have this little prick

25:07.810 --> 25:10.552
tell us who this maestro is.
- Look, tomorrow, all right?

25:10.552 --> 25:14.164
For now, let's just give them
a few hours to get settled.

25:14.164 --> 25:16.036
I hate to say it,
but one of these days,

25:16.036 --> 25:17.559
your empathy is gonna be
your undoing.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.040
Yeah, well,
I could say the same thing

25:20.040 --> 25:21.520
about your lack of it.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.740
Muncy.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.437
Captain, I got a call
from Maria Garcia

25:26.437 --> 25:27.743
as we were leaving just now.

25:27.743 --> 25:30.180
She said she had some kind
of change of heart.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.530
You think she'll testify?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.183
<i>No idea.</i>

25:33.183 --> 25:34.837
She's at her parents'
restaurant, La Capital.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.710
Okay.
Have her come in tomorrow.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.363
I don't know, I'm worried
she'll change her mind.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.888
You know where this
restaurant is, La Capital?

25:41.888 --> 25:43.629
It's a few blocks from here.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.021
<i>I could hop out
and meet you there?</i>

25:45.021 --> 25:46.457
Uh, no.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.590
You and Velasco make sure
that Albert

25:48.590 --> 25:50.244
and his mother get settled.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.506
Duarte and I'll take it.

25:53.639 --> 25:54.944
Okay.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.865
- Hello?
- Anyone here?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.606
I see you got my message.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.667
You know this guy?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.625
You do too.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.975
From your crime board.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.456
Ah.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.676
Oscar Papa.

26:34.201 --> 26:37.204
I hope you like pupusas,
Captain, because Mrs. Garcia,

26:37.204 --> 26:40.599
she makes the best
in the neighborhood, no?

26:46.387 --> 26:48.476
Please, have a seat.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.539
No, thanks.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.107
You could use some meat
on those bones, Captain.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.153
Well,
I'd almost be flattered

27:13.153 --> 27:14.937
if you hadn't tried to kill me.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.547
I don't kill people, Captain.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.027
No.

27:18.027 --> 27:22.423
No, you have kids
do it for you.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.947
That's a pretty galling
accusation, don't you think?

27:24.947 --> 27:27.820
Coming from a woman
who just crippled a teenager?

27:27.820 --> 27:29.038
Mm.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.086
What's up, Duarte?

27:33.086 --> 27:35.566
You were right.
These are good.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.394
So you two
do know each other.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.268
We've never had the pleasure.

27:41.268 --> 27:44.663
But all the same,
I know this prick.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.013
He likes to buy diapers
for my guys' girlfriends

27:47.013 --> 27:48.536
when they get pregnant.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.712
Rented an ice cream truck
one day for all the kids

27:50.712 --> 27:54.194
in the neighborhood like
some kind of little perv,

27:54.194 --> 27:56.762
giving out candy from a van.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.374
You rape moms and groom
their sons to be killers.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.332
And I'm a perv.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.117
I didn't rape no one.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.075
So then what is
all this about?

28:06.075 --> 28:07.903
I wanted to clear the air.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.253
That's pretty funny
coming from the head of BX9.

28:10.253 --> 28:13.126
Ah--
I'm a concerned citizen.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.389
Hmm?

28:15.389 --> 28:20.046
I have a mother,
a girlfriend, a daughter.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.004
So let me guess.

28:22.004 --> 28:26.487
They just found out that you
use rape as a tool to recruit?

28:26.487 --> 28:28.402
I didn't have anything
to do with that tree.

28:28.402 --> 28:29.795
But you knew about it.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.753
I found out
when you found out about it.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.059
How is that possible?

28:33.059 --> 28:34.538
I've been sitting
on that for a year.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.891
Nice guy.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.762
Believe what you wanna believe.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.156
All I know is,
that tree is embarrassing

28:43.156 --> 28:44.723
to everyone with Latin blood.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.594
So why am I here?

28:46.594 --> 28:49.162
Maybe if Bronx SVU
wasn't so messed up,

28:49.162 --> 28:51.860
you wouldn't have evidence
of 100 rapes

28:51.860 --> 28:53.427
literally hanging on a tree.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.995
You know that
I'm not Bronx SVU.

28:55.995 --> 28:59.563
But everybody in NYPD knew
that place was messed up,

28:59.563 --> 29:03.045
probably the brunt of jokes
for years now, I'm telling you.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.568
So what now?

29:04.568 --> 29:06.353
I just wanna
let you know that

29:06.353 --> 29:08.790
the problem's being dealt with.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.314
You wanna clean up this mess,
turn yourself in.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.142
For what?

29:13.142 --> 29:15.101
Racketeering, smuggling, prostitution,

29:15.101 --> 29:17.277
murder, extortion.

29:17.277 --> 29:21.934
How about systematic rape?

29:21.934 --> 29:23.849
Hey, guys.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.633
I'm just a local businessman.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.810
With a whole crew
at his disposal?

29:28.810 --> 29:31.595
Well, that's what
you don't get, Duarte.

29:31.595 --> 29:35.338
I started BX9 in high school
to protect me

29:35.338 --> 29:37.384
and other South
and Central American kids

29:37.384 --> 29:40.474
from being picked on
by norteños like you.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.955
Okay, so I'm the bully.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.307
We're not a gang.

29:49.483 --> 29:50.919
We are a brotherhood.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.533
An idea.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.842
And you just can't
kill one of those.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.409
Unlike people.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.197
That looks like it hurt.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.548
You want some ice for that?

30:13.159 --> 30:15.378
Are we free to go?

30:23.430 --> 30:25.736
You're free to go.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.313
I'm sorry.

30:37.313 --> 30:38.662
That makes two of us.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.671
I've seen psychopaths before,

30:47.671 --> 30:49.325
but never one
with an army behind them.

30:51.719 --> 30:52.676
Fin.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.722
DNA came in from that tree.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.464
We can tie Bug Bear
and his buddy, Sacrilege,

30:57.464 --> 30:59.814
to about 100 potential rapes.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.337
Well, that's leverage.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.035
So we play them
against each other

31:03.035 --> 31:04.601
and we see who flips first.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.129
You lied to me
about Sacrilege.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.696
He's in here alive.
- You wanna talk about lies?

31:12.696 --> 31:16.875
We can connect your DNA
to the underwear on that tree.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.311
That's 100 rapes.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.313
If they're consecutive,
might get you out in what,

31:20.313 --> 31:21.923
400, 500 years?

31:21.923 --> 31:23.229
Unless you talk.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.839
Are you crazy?

31:24.839 --> 31:26.232
This place is crawling
with 19th Street,

31:26.232 --> 31:27.668
not to mention BX9.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.235
For my client to talk,
he's gonna need protection.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.801
And he'll get it.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.934
But first, we need to know
what he's offering.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.677
And it'll have to include
testifying at trial.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.029
I gotta think.
I gotta think.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.813
And we're out of time.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.296
We're talking
to Sacrilege next.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.043
And what if
neither of them talk?

31:55.043 --> 31:57.219
We still got Maria.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.786
Maybe she's willing
to make amends

31:58.786 --> 32:00.614
for setting us up
by testifying.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.268
Well, I wouldn't
hold my breath.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.924
What the hell is that?

32:15.846 --> 32:17.892
Well, I guess
we know what Oscar Papa meant

32:17.892 --> 32:20.416
by the problem
being dealt with.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.466
So Bug Bear's dead?

32:26.466 --> 32:27.771
More holes than a colander.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.556
He died from his injuries

32:29.556 --> 32:32.820
an hour after getting stabbed
in front of me and Duarte.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.909
So Duarte's leaning
into Sacrilege.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.041
If he wasn't talking before,

32:36.041 --> 32:38.608
he's sure as hell
not talking now.

32:38.608 --> 32:42.438
So I got DNA,
but I got no viable witnesses.

32:42.438 --> 32:43.831
What about Maria Garcia?

32:43.831 --> 32:45.180
Maria has always
been a good girl.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.355
I should have seen it
for what it was.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.966
A setup?

32:47.966 --> 32:50.185
Well, in the meantime, I got
no case against Oscar Papa.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.710
Not for the rapes, not for
the hit on an NYPD captain.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.582
What about that kid you shot?
Did he tell you anything?

32:55.582 --> 32:59.238
Albert, he kept talking
about some maestro

32:59.238 --> 33:01.022
putting him up to it.
- Maestro.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.981
You mean <i>maestro,</i> teacher?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.070
I didn't press him on it.

33:05.070 --> 33:08.116
He hadn't seen his mother
in God knows how long.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.510
So he just needed a minute.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.599
Now that they both
know their safety

33:12.599 --> 33:17.343
is our number one priority,
maybe you should ask him.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.477
I think the biggest hurdle
is gonna be his loyalty,

33:21.477 --> 33:24.741
and not to his mother,
but to his gang.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.134
You sound like
you know about that.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.096
Better than you think.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.054
Congratulations.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.666
You just became my <i>maestro.</i>

33:36.666 --> 33:38.364
You're coming with me.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.372
I can't tell you who
the <i>maestro</i> is.

33:46.372 --> 33:50.158
You said you rode the top
of the train with him.

33:50.158 --> 33:54.510
You told me that
he showed you the stars.

33:54.510 --> 33:58.036
This is the guy that told
you to kill Captain Benson.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.212
Look at me.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.347
I know what you're
going through.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.175
I know what it feels like
to be your age

34:07.175 --> 34:08.916
and to have no identity.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.138
But guys that age, they just--

34:15.009 --> 34:18.752
They know more stuff than
what they're telling you.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.233
At least he saw me.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.844
So is that what it is?
You feel invisible?

34:23.844 --> 34:25.063
'Cause you're not.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.458
Don't let him be invisible.

34:42.167 --> 34:47.215
Albert, do you wanna see
the stars again?

34:47.215 --> 34:48.956
I know that you do.

34:50.871 --> 34:54.179
But you gotta tell me
who the <i>maestro</i> is.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.574
Tell me.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.233
A driver.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.540
He works for Oscar Papa.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.890
He approached me
and my friends,

35:09.890 --> 35:13.459
offered us a way to make
the jump to soldiers overnight.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.027
By killing me.

35:25.993 --> 35:28.387
<i>Policia! Policia!</i>

35:34.871 --> 35:36.917
Kids, stay back.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.454
- Benny Barros!
- NYPD!

35:52.454 --> 35:54.456
- Hands up!
- Baby, who are they?

35:54.456 --> 35:56.241
- I don't know.
- You're in trouble again?

35:56.241 --> 35:57.981
And I thought you put
all this behind you!

35:57.981 --> 35:59.940
Ma'am, sit down!
Be quiet!

35:59.940 --> 36:01.376
Hey, don't talk
to her like that!

36:01.376 --> 36:03.987
Hey! Let's go.
We're taking you in.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.994
I didn't do nothing.
You hear me?

36:10.994 --> 36:12.605
You got the wrong guy.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.563
Here, let's go.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.436
You gotta hit me.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.089
- What?
- Seriously, hit me.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.004
Otherwise, they're gonna kill
me in jail just like Bug Bear.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.658
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

36:22.658 --> 36:25.705
You're wanted for the attempted
murder of a police officer.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.360
- It wasn't me!
- Get in the car now!

36:28.360 --> 36:29.535
Ugh!

36:34.279 --> 36:36.106
What the hell was that?

36:37.586 --> 36:38.979
Empathy.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.898
I told those kids
the first one

36:44.898 --> 36:46.639
to kill Captain Benson
gets to soldier up.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.336
"Soldier up"?
What does that mean?

36:48.336 --> 36:52.035
That they become
full-blooded members of BX9.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.428
Why do they call
you "maestro"?

36:53.428 --> 36:57.040
Because Oscar Papa
is the word, knowledge.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.564
I'm the one who spreads it.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.827
And by that, you mean
you're his mouthpiece?

37:00.827 --> 37:02.524
Correct.

37:02.524 --> 37:03.873
Unfortunately, I can't
just take your word for that.

37:03.873 --> 37:06.354
I can corroborate
everything I'm saying.

37:06.354 --> 37:09.879
I know names, dates, places.
- Victims.

37:09.879 --> 37:13.361
My client has all his boss's
phone conversations on tape.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.537
Kept a recording device
in his car.

37:16.973 --> 37:21.195
And he's willing to testify
to this in open court?

37:21.195 --> 37:23.023
Under the right protection?

37:23.023 --> 37:24.677
Yes.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.461
Ever since my cousin Ricky
was shivved,

37:26.461 --> 37:27.984
I've been waiting
for you guys to show up.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.551
What do you want in return?

37:29.551 --> 37:31.074
Freedom.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.120
From?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.253
There's only two ways
out of BX9.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.256
One's the witness box,
the other's the pine box.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.127
Let's just say
I'm choosing the former.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.044
That enough?

37:44.044 --> 37:46.438
Yeah. For now.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.136
Let's get started
on your grand jury testimony.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.401
- It's pretty quiet in here.
- Yeah.

37:53.401 --> 37:56.317
Like the morning
after a snowstorm.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.233
Well, it turns out
you were right.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.453
- It's not the first time.
- Yeah.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.238
Yeah, but this time,
we both got what we wanted.

38:04.238 --> 38:05.326
I mean,
you're about to bring down

38:05.326 --> 38:06.719
the guy who tried to kill you--

38:06.719 --> 38:09.809
And you got the DOJ out
of your underwear drawer.

38:11.463 --> 38:14.466
Yeah, speaking of underwear,

38:14.466 --> 38:17.599
100 cases on their way
to being cleared in two days.

38:17.599 --> 38:21.516
That's--well, that's a hell
of a clearance rate.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.562
I can't tell if you're happy.

38:23.562 --> 38:27.740
Well, I'll be happy
when Oscar Papa is in prison.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.657
That makes two of us.

38:40.970 --> 38:44.322
Where do you want
the new detectives to sit?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.585
Let them sit
based on seniority.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.674
I'm not giving up my desk.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.856
So what are you gonna do
now the DOJ's clearing out?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.118
I don't know.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.598
I was so focused
on the deaf case we closed,

38:59.598 --> 39:01.077
I don't even think about it.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.383
How about a round?

39:02.383 --> 39:04.037
You buying?

39:04.037 --> 39:05.386
I could, but you're rich.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.519
That's fair.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.094
Ahh.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.270
Thanks for waiting, man.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.403
Oh, that woman just won't quit.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.884
Not a problem, Mr. Papa.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.842
Hey, you're not Benny.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.412
I wouldn't make
any sudden moves.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.373
She seems really pissed.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.292
Oscar Papa,
you're under arrest

39:42.292 --> 39:44.294
for rape and attempted murder.

39:44.294 --> 39:45.687
Ah.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.386
I have never been in a
position like this before.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.474
I guess I need a lawyer.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.563
Yeah. You do.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.523
Would you like
to do the honors?

39:55.523 --> 39:57.917
You've been after this guy
longer than anyone.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.444
That an apology?

40:03.444 --> 40:07.448
No, but it's as close
as you're gonna get.
