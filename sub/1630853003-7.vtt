WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.969
It was a polio year,

00:11.052 --> 00:13.096
and I was 6 years old,

00:13.179 --> 00:14.723
and my mother
decides to teach me

00:14.806 --> 00:17.100
every card and board game
known to man.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.478
Gin rummy, blackjack,
poker, bridge.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.439
Eventually,
we landed on Monopoly.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.525
Now, Monopoly takes strategy,

00:25.608 --> 00:27.902
and skill,
like those other games,

00:27.986 --> 00:30.572
but it also throws in
an element of chance.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.199
So, no matter how good
you are at the game,

00:33.283 --> 00:34.909
the bad breaks come,

00:34.993 --> 00:36.661
and they knock you on your ass.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.998
And, well, lately,
we've had a few of those.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.041
Frank
"Banker's up your ass.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.418
Pay three million bucks."

00:43.501 --> 00:45.336
"Coach falls off bike.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.380
Go back 10 spaces."

00:47.464 --> 00:49.799
"Mother diagnosed
with metastatic cancer.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.218
Stare into abyss."

00:52.302 --> 00:55.430
Yeah.
So, it turns out my mother
wasn't losing her marbles.

00:55.513 --> 00:59.726
It was cancer giving
her strokes. Anyway...

00:59.809 --> 01:03.480
Thing about luck is,
it cuts both ways.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.983
You hold on long enough,
and you stay in the game.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.444
It's the law of big numbers.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.738
Eventually...

01:12.447 --> 01:13.907
it goes your way.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.994
"Win NBA Championship.
Find happiness
and peace you seek."

01:20.038 --> 01:21.873
My point is...

01:21.956 --> 01:23.291
I'm fucking due.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.252
("My Favorite Mutiny"
by The Coup playing

02:54.048 --> 02:56.593
-(whistle blows

02:59.554 --> 03:01.931
Chick
Well, that stings, Patrick.
Lakers staring down

03:02.015 --> 03:03.349
the barrel of another loss,

03:03.433 --> 03:06.269
now hanging on to first in
the division by a wee thread.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.230
Momentum is wearing off.
With Jack McKinney out,

03:09.314 --> 03:12.066
-Paul Westhead is trying to do
an awful lot all by himself.
-Pat Hey! Psst!

03:12.150 --> 03:13.943
Kid! Come here!

03:14.027 --> 03:16.279
Defense!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.197
Jesus fucking Christ.
Jack, what the fuck?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
-Okay, come on!
-Hey, Coach!

03:20.366 --> 03:21.576
Get me back in the game!

03:21.659 --> 03:23.578
Come on, Coach.
Get me back in there!

03:23.661 --> 03:25.830
-Get Silk outta there!
-Come on!

03:25.914 --> 03:28.291
Get your goddamn head outta
your ass, for Christ's sake!

03:28.374 --> 03:29.959
You suck, Westhead,
you suck!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.753
-Ref!
-You're outta timeouts.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.713
Riley said that
I should tell you.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.259
Fuck! Okay.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.262
Cooper, foul!
Take the foul!

03:41.346 --> 03:43.097
-Well,
Michael Cooper takes

03:43.181 --> 03:45.433
an intentional foul,
and, uh, well,

03:45.516 --> 03:47.226
you gotta wonder
whose intent it was

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479
because he's picked up
his sixth foul,

03:49.562 --> 03:51.856
-and he has fouled
out of the game.
-No, no, you're staying in.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.234
-Coach, that's six.
I'm out of the game.
-Okay, Chones!

03:55.318 --> 03:57.362
Ankle.
He's in the locker room.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.241
Landsberger?

04:03.242 --> 04:05.453
-Me? Landsberger?
-Yes! Come on.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.331
You out your
goddamn mind, man.
You out your goddamn mind.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.216
Let's focus up, guys.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.844
Norman
Alright, Country, look.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.346
Go quick.
Two for one, yeah?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.807
Y'all take off on the inbounds,
and I'll hit you on the flop.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.476
-Word.
-Cool? Cool?
You good, Coach?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.896
Alright, we got ya,
Coach.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.441
Jerry
You need to cut bait.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.568
Bill
You're jumping the gun.
He's jumping the gun.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.153
West-- Westhead's still
getting his sea legs.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.114
Oh, fucking-- You can't
teach a pig to paint, Bill.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.116
I mean, the boys,
th-they're out there,
treating him like

04:43.199 --> 04:45.952
a substitute fuckin' teacher
'cause that's what he is.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.495
Fellas are
coaching themselves.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.664
-And we're surviving it.
-For now.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.457
What are you even
doing here, Jerry?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.042
Shouldn't you be
on a golf course?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.794
Oh! Fuck it!
I may be retired, Bill,

04:54.877 --> 04:56.587
but I ain't fuckin'
Helen Keller!

04:56.671 --> 04:59.632
-I can see what's going on!
I give a fuck! I care!
-Jerry Okay. Okay!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.384
You don't think Paul
can hold the fort

05:01.467 --> 05:03.011
until McKinney is back
on his feet?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.346
It depends. How soon is that?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.557
Docs don't know.
Maybe the All-Star game.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.393
See? Or maybe the Playoffs.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.561
Then it becomes a chess match.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.938
If we don't have
a real coach soon,

05:14.022 --> 05:16.190
you may as well give up
on the fuckin' season.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.776
I'm not giving up on anything.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.445
Then Elgin Baylor's our guy.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.864
Y... Your guy.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.198
I just heard from him.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.035
Rumors hit him, too,
that we may need reinforcements.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.078
Lifetime Laker,
guys respect him.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.289
Good story. Hell, great
fuckin' story for the fans.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.790
Shit, I woulda hired him
the first time around

05:32.874 --> 05:35.752
if we had the chance, but,
uh, him leaving Utah now?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.296
Well, that's just kismet.
Lady luck.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.965
We play his brand of
offense, he slots right in.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.760
And if we pull
the trigger soon...

05:43.843 --> 05:45.720
Well, he's still got time
to make some changes

05:45.803 --> 05:47.388
and make the team his own.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.973
I'm telling you.
It's shit

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
-or get off the pot.
-Alright.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.394
We bring him in as a sub.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.146
And what happens
when McKinney's ready?

05:55.229 --> 05:57.231
Well, that's going
to be the problem.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.567
No coach worth his salt is
going to come in as a temp,

05:59.650 --> 06:01.819
so you'll have to make Elgin...

06:01.903 --> 06:04.155
you know, a guarantee,
probably the end of the season.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.907
You're saying cut bait
on McKinney, too.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.742
It's a big risk,
changing horses.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.912
It's all a fucking big risk,
Bill. I mean, shit.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.371
Your best bet's
in the hospital,

06:12.455 --> 06:14.749
you got Hamlet on the sideline
looking for his fuckin' dick.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.085
All I'm saying is "interim."

06:18.836 --> 06:21.714
It must end. It's what
the fuckin' word means.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.258
You have to put your chips
on someone soon,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.677
or you can kiss
the fuckin' season goodbye.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.641
Fuck a duck.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.866
Crisscross applesauce.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.243
What?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.453
Crisscross applesauce.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.205
Could you please not help me?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.373
Just...

06:56.791 --> 06:58.042
Yes, you're almost there.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.670
You just have to ke-- keep
pulling the lace through the--

07:00.753 --> 07:02.130
-Goddamn it!

07:04.215 --> 07:06.968
Been working on your
shooting touch?

07:07.051 --> 07:08.970
I got a coach around
here somewhere.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.430
This a bad time?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.850
No. Stay.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.810
We need the break.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.936
I'm sorry.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.943
She needs a break from me.
You caught me in a mood.

07:24.026 --> 07:27.029
Hm, you must have seen
the game last night.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.614
They pulled it out.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.866
Yeah,

07:29.949 --> 07:32.451
and the guys said that
should've been an easy one.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.497
What else
are the guys saying?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.666
That we're being out-coached.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.878
And this keeps up,
we're gonna blow our shot.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.923
They've seen enough.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.885
I need to make
a run this season, Jack.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.681
Then bet on me.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.684
I know I don't look like
your sure thing, but...

07:57.476 --> 07:59.187
I'm your guy.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.231
I'm comin' back.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.817
-If Westhead keeps slip--
-Give him the road trip.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.530
Indiana, Detroit.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.033
Boston. Now, there's a test.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.534
That's the best team
in the league.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.329
Closest thing to playoff-
level competition.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.914
And it's the Garden.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.957
You know what the Garden's like.
It's a beast.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.169
If Paul can beat them
in the Garden,

08:23.252 --> 08:25.880
then he can mind the store
until the doctors clear me

08:25.963 --> 08:28.466
to come back. One month.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.593
Two months tops.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.972
Look at you.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.646
Boston.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.731
Jack McKinney
You're under a microscope.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.024
West is circling like a vulture

08:45.107 --> 08:46.901
and already looking
to replace us.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.528
Christ.
I'm doing my best, Jack.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.113
Mc
I need better than that.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.449
I came back from
the dead for this.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.410
-For this, Paul.
-I know.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.120
I should be gone. I'm not.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.790
I'm here, and I'll be
back on that sideline

09:00.873 --> 09:02.375
if it kills me again.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.461
But not if you can't keep
this thing together for me.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.964
Paul
I won't let you down, Jack.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.808
I'm just glad a lifetime of this
shit is good for something.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.727
I would, uh...

09:21.811 --> 09:24.230
What do you...
What do you think

09:24.313 --> 09:26.941
about if we make this
something more official?

09:27.024 --> 09:30.444
-This thing, you and me?
-Uh...

09:30.528 --> 09:32.989
I'm a married man.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.700
I'm flailing out there,
Pat.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.203
I know it.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.832
Everybody knows it.
I need an assistant.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.458
And not like this,
you know, ad hoc

09:44.542 --> 09:46.794
passing notes down
from the press box.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.005
I need somebody with me.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.008
On the bench.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.759
For this trip.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.721
-But, assistant coach?
-Yeah, I mean, why not?

09:57.596 --> 10:00.016
You're fucking
great at it.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.351
Look, no offense
to your broadcasting career,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.061
but Chick is not
going to miss you.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.064
-Is he? I will.
-No.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.359
I really will.
So, so, what do you say?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.529
Please.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.993
What about Jack?

10:19.076 --> 10:21.412
What happens when
he comes back? I mean,

10:21.495 --> 10:23.080
if I quit my job for this,

10:23.164 --> 10:25.875
I can't go back
to wandering the beach.
I-I'll fucking croak.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.044
We'll keep you-- He'll...

10:28.127 --> 10:30.046
He'll keep you on.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.965
-Yeah?
-Absolutely.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.894
Fuck it! What? Fuck it.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.562
-Fuck it yes?

10:46.645 --> 10:48.397
Shit, fuck it. Yeah, I'm in.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.608
-Yes!
-Let's kick some ass.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.651
This is-- Let's kick--
Yeah, absolutely.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.570
I'm gonna shake your hand,
and I'm gonna hug you.

10:54.653 --> 10:57.239
Dick Enberg
And Johnson's putting
on a show tonight,

10:57.323 --> 11:01.035
a tremendous athlete with
a talented team behind him.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.120
But, man for man, Larry Bird

11:03.204 --> 11:05.081
has got to be
the more skilled player.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.916
This kid from
Indiana farm country,

11:06.999 --> 11:09.585
he's not thinking about
the shot in front of him.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.545
He's thinking about the game.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.632
He must see the whole
court in his head.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.345
I want to thank my family.
I want to thank Coach

11:19.428 --> 11:22.264
for drawing up a game plan
and Indiana State for--

11:22.348 --> 11:24.600
-They played a hell of a game.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.270
Mm, all the fans
that done came out.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.565
-I just wanna say thank--

11:31.649 --> 11:34.902
Gonna torch that
smiley ass in Boston, punk.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.239
You wish, motherfucker.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.330
Here you go, sir. Time to take
the Magic Show on the road.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.417
Three cities, five nights,

11:49.500 --> 11:52.128
two in Michigan.
Gonna catch the fam,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.964
see Cook,
then it's off to Boston.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.133
Hey, Magic! Magic! Hey, Magic!

11:57.216 --> 12:00.177
First shot at Larry Bird
as a pro. You excited?

12:00.261 --> 12:03.013
Larry on this trip?
Guess I must've forgot.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.557
I got my mind
on Detroit.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.351
Whole team be coming by
the Johnson family house

12:07.435 --> 12:08.644
for Christmas dinner.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.312
We'll bring y'all doggie bag.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.022
I know it's a big rematch.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.691
-Any nerves?
-Nerves?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.317
Nah, it's just
another game, man.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.236
I'm sure you've heard
the numbers Larry put on Philly.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.280
I mean, they're
already talking MVP.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.657
Yeah? Hadn't heard.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.784
Excuse me, fellas.
Got a flight to catch.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.078
Do you think
he's Rookie of the Year?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.791
You know, y'all keep
asking me about him.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.128
Larry took me
too light last time.
And how that work out?

12:34.211 --> 12:36.672
-Dude best be worryin' about me.
-That's my quote.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
-So you out for blood this time?
-Will he be crying
into another towel...

12:38.966 --> 12:40.926
-Gentlemen!
-...after this game or what?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.095
That's enough.
We have a flight.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.264
No more questions, Cap.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.891
I fucked up, didn't I?

12:52.271 --> 12:54.273
Hey, Earvin.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.650
There you go.
First road trip?

12:56.734 --> 12:57.818
-Mm-hmm.
-Alright. You know,

12:57.902 --> 12:59.445
there are gonna be
a lot of groupies out there.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.238
You just wanna... wrap it up,

13:01.322 --> 13:02.448
you know what I'm saying?

13:02.531 --> 13:05.034
-We'll see.
-Alright? Trust me.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.119
-Hey, kid.
-Hey, Chick.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.496
I'm telling you,
Patricia, you're making

13:08.579 --> 13:10.664
a big mistake with this
whole coaching business.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.791
I think your true calling
is in herding cats.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.377
-Ha, ha. Thanks, Chick.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.837
I'm gonna miss him.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.131
-Take this, please. Thank you.
-Please! Just listen! Pat!

13:19.215 --> 13:20.508
-Jerry?
-You tell the Gestapo here--

13:20.591 --> 13:21.800
This man does
not have a ticket.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.719
-Jerry, what are you--
-Jerry West. Right on there.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.137
Thank you very
much for your help.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.306
-God, Jesus fuckin' Christ.
-What is this? What's going on?

13:27.389 --> 13:28.682
Well, it's
a last-minute thing.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.893
I'm doing a little,
uh, consulting,

13:30.976 --> 13:32.811
working on a, uh,
scouting problem for Buss.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.522
Well, the office didn't tell me
you were coming. I...

13:34.605 --> 13:36.690
Well, it must be right there.
It's a little, you know,

13:36.774 --> 13:38.359
mum's the word.
Don't wanna
ruffle any feathers.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.736
So, which seat am I in, Pat?
Sort this out, okay?

13:40.819 --> 13:42.780
-Don't leave me hanging.
Thank you for your help.
-Uh...

13:42.863 --> 13:44.698
-Next to Chick here?
-Uh,

13:44.782 --> 13:46.700
well, no, you can
have my seat.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.745
-Yeah? Where's that?
-That's, uh,
right by the toilet.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.499
-Over there. Coach.
-Down here in
the clown section, huh?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.503
Hey, uh, Paul?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.506
Any clue why West is here?
He says he's on a scout.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.511
Are we making any
moves on personnel?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.559
I mean, if we drop this one
to Indiana, we might have to.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.026
Well, you weren't wrong
about your mother.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.279
She's one hell of an accountant.
Even her mistakes are good.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.573
-How's that, Claire?
-Claire Three words.

14:25.656 --> 14:29.243
Depreciation of assets.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.869
We're gonna need
some more words.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.246
Okay. It's like this.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.748
Every team pays
their players as employees,

14:34.832 --> 14:37.251
but, according to the IRS,
they're also assets.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.129
Which means we should be able
to deduct their total value

14:40.212 --> 14:41.630
in depreciation over time.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.091
-Yeah, their salaries.
-No, we already write off
their salaries.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.634
That's just what they earn.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.636
The total value,
that's more murky.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.555
That's what they're worth.
Without these players,

14:49.638 --> 14:51.974
we don't have a team.
So, in that sense,

14:52.057 --> 14:53.809
their total value
to the business

14:53.892 --> 14:57.104
must be the total value
of the business.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.397
Everything you paid for it.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.567
-No.
-No fucking way. Impossible.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.027
Yet strangely legal,

15:03.110 --> 15:05.571
and maybe just enough
to save your ass.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.283
If we can keep winning
and make a playoff run,

15:09.366 --> 15:11.535
which, I guess you know,
is a pretty big if.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.748
Lakers here in Indiana

15:15.831 --> 15:17.875
on the first of a three-game
holiday season road trip

15:17.958 --> 15:19.960
against a struggling
Pacers team.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.087
This should be as sure
a thing as a candy cane

15:22.171 --> 15:24.548
in your stocking
Christmas morning.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.637
Earvin
Yeah, they got us there, gang.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.472
But we gonna get
'em the next one.

15:31.555 --> 15:35.100
We headin' to D-Town,
and we ain't losing in D-Town.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.687
You feel me? Go home,

15:38.771 --> 15:40.773
get me some of my
mama's home cooking.

15:40.856 --> 15:45.027
-And we gonna be a'ight.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.322
Hey! Magic Man! Sign these?

15:48.405 --> 15:51.575
-Larry's gonna eat your lunch.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.910
Hey, put the tits away.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.330
We'll see.
You tune in and find out.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.500
So, should we be nagging Coach
to give you some more minutes?

15:59.583 --> 16:02.169
Spencer
Man, what I say? Huh?
Maybe if the coach put me in

16:02.252 --> 16:04.546
outside of garbage time,
gave me a real run,

16:04.630 --> 16:07.341
they wouldn't be gettin' beat
in the paint. That's for sure.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.760
-But that ain't on me.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.805
You can ask the
Nutty Professor though.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.181
Shit.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.266
You fuckin' kidding me?

16:22.815 --> 16:23.899
Listen to me.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.693
That crossed
a fucking line, alright?

16:25.776 --> 16:26.902
He's been pushing you.
Alright?

16:26.985 --> 16:28.404
The other guys see you
walk away from this,

16:28.487 --> 16:30.739
-you're gonna be
a substitute forever.
-It's my fault.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.034
I heard something
a few weeks ago.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.996
I overreacted.
I benched him.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.083
it spiraled,
and now it's public.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.961
-But it's my fault.
-Alright, so?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.796
Talk to him.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.923
Tell him. Tell Spencer.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.967
-Just apologize.
-That's your...

16:50.050 --> 16:51.885
That's your grand advice?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.762
They already treat me
like a pushover.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.223
These aren't fucking
college kids.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.016
Paul, these are men. Okay?

16:58.100 --> 17:02.062
They will respect you
if you treat them with respect.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.524
-Let him through,
let him through.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.946
I appreciate the insight, Pat.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.630
Shit.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.179
Jerry
Well...

17:36.555 --> 17:38.182
Oh-for-one on the road trip.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.810
Are you still sure you wanna
bet it all on beating Boston?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.565
-How's your mother?
-She's pretending to be asleep.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.942
Landed on my best hotel
and conked right out.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.487
A Monopoly man, huh?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.363
Yeah. You play?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.032
I used to when
the kids were young.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.409
And then, they decided
to stop playing with me

17:57.493 --> 17:59.787
because I guess I can be
a little competitive.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.497
-Mine started ganging up

18:01.580 --> 18:04.124
together with their mother
to beat me.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.001
I'd be out making
business deals all week.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
They'd be plotting how
to keep me off of Boardwalk.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.005
You know, I probably should've
let 'em win more often.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.965
Maybe we'd still be playing.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.013
You always think
there's gonna be a point

18:18.096 --> 18:19.598
where it's gonna
slow down, don't you?

18:22.059 --> 18:25.729
Now, we got two in college,
two more about to be in college.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.357
-And here's your vacation.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.651
Wanna play a game?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.820
If you think you can handle it.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.823
You don't strike me as
somebody who likes to lose.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.283
Oh, the top hat never loses.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.370
Not until he gets his ass
kicked by the shoe.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.831
Really?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.375
Clear off the Jell-O, hotshot.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.169
You're about to taste
the wrath of the top hat.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.555
Anchorman
Local Lansing hero
Earvin "Magic" Johnson

18:59.638 --> 19:02.724
is back in Michigan tonight,
and not just on your TVs,

19:02.808 --> 19:04.726
advertising shoes.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.436
Of course, with all

19:06.520 --> 19:09.356
the fancy shit our boy's
been up to in LA,

19:09.439 --> 19:12.693
the question on everybody's
mind, will Magic bother

19:12.776 --> 19:16.488
looking twice at his old
homegirl Cookie Kelly?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.699
Or did he only send
her tickets to the game

19:18.782 --> 19:21.535
to rub her nose in it
that he's moved on,

19:21.618 --> 19:25.539
and she's a head case for
still carrying the torch?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.332
-Tune in--

19:27.416 --> 19:29.501
Girl, when you are married,

19:29.585 --> 19:31.962
you buying me a big old
diamond ring to match

19:32.045 --> 19:34.923
-for introducing you.
A finder's fee.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.885
Honestly,
I don't even think
I'm interested.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.305
So, you ain't worried?

19:41.388 --> 19:42.264
Mm-mmm!

19:42.347 --> 19:43.599
Boy always had a wandering eye.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.267
Bet by now,
they fell right out his head,

19:45.350 --> 19:47.436
Then why he calling me then?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.937
Every night, out there in Cali.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.064
Why'd he send
the last girl's daddy

19:51.148 --> 19:53.025
just so I would
show my face?

19:53.108 --> 19:55.903
Girl, I don't need no ring.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.072
I got that man wrapped
around my little finger.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.407
Okay, Cookie.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.250
-Over here!
-Yeah, it's good to be back.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.961
-Real good. Yeah. There you go.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.467
Yeah, no problem.
What's your name? Shawn?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.968
My name is Shawn.
It's nice to meet you!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.136
Hey, Shawn.

20:21.219 --> 20:23.639
Man, I got you.
Here you go.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.723
Thanks, man!

20:24.806 --> 20:27.184
Well, isn't he
the center of attention?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.353
Yeah yeah, he sure is.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.188
-You gonna be as good
as me one day.
-Thank you so much!

20:31.271 --> 20:33.190
-So cool.
-You're the best, Magic!

20:33.273 --> 20:36.234
I'm sorry, y'all.
I gotta go. Cook!

20:37.069 --> 20:40.238
Mm-mmm!

20:40.322 --> 20:43.116
You believe this?
Since we rode in.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.953
-Thought Stevie Wonder
must be in town, but no!

20:46.036 --> 20:47.537
It's all for me.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.125
It's... something else.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.377
Ain't it?

20:55.253 --> 20:56.463
Hey, Rhonda.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.673
Hey.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.424
I missed you.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.510
Mm, stop.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.262
You stop lookin'
so good.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.598
Earleatha, darling,
you look ravishing!

21:06.682 --> 21:07.975
Dr. Day.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.185
Man from Buick
is here to see you.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.062
Oh, can it wait?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.647
Gonna see Pop
later on tonight,

21:13.730 --> 21:15.315
he was wanting
to talk it over.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.902
Best not. Bad idea to
keep these corporations waiting.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.196
Look-it, you want to get
the old man on the phone?

21:27.327 --> 21:30.664
Nah. Nah. You think
it's the real deal,

21:30.747 --> 21:32.332
-let's do it.
-Okay. Wise man.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.960
Excuse us for a minute, angels.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.463
I'll be right back, Cook.
-Mm-hm.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.675
I heard he picks some girls
out of the stands at every game.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.428
You should've worn
a brighter color.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.222
You could've wore
a disco ball, bitch.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.896
Come on, Cookie.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.036
Coach Riley.
Coach Riley.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.663
I'm Coach Riley.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.216
How you doin'? Ahem.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.555
Jerry
What the fuck's this
motherfucker up to?

22:29.765 --> 22:32.267
Oh, wow. Hi. Hey, Jerry.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.901
-This Detroit?
-Yes, it is, Jerry. Hi.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.569
How's the scout coming?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.989
Uh-huh. Yeah, it's...
coming. Just, uh,

22:46.073 --> 22:49.242
just making sure we got
the personnel we need
to make a run.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.957
We're, uh...

22:57.000 --> 22:58.835
we're turning it around.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.754
Just you watch.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.214
Mm-hmm.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.180
Mm. Hey, Jer.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.849
Eating my leftovers?

23:15.936 --> 23:18.855
-I'll leave you boys to it.
-Alright.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.859
Lay off the fuckin'
French fries.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.863
I like french fries.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.533
Don't sweat it, alright?
Come on. He's a busybody.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.619
Don't sweat it.
Anyway...

23:33.453 --> 23:35.497
God's smiling. Hm?

23:37.582 --> 23:39.543
Detroit's the pits
of the league.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.920
We got these suckers.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.756
Well, folks, the Lakers are
looking to redeem themselves

23:44.840 --> 23:46.550
and move from
Santa's naughty list

23:46.633 --> 23:48.301
to something nicer
with a win tonight

23:48.385 --> 23:50.262
against the last place
Detroit Pistons.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.013
Shouldn't take
a Christmas miracle

23:52.097 --> 23:53.890
to mark this one a W.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.911
Sent the bus to Lansing.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.831
I told them you
had family in town.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.749
I'm certainly glad I don't.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.168
It's one game. Hm?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.962
Who watches basketball
on Christmas?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.465
Shake it off
and function forward.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.509
Forward where?

24:29.593 --> 24:32.387
You said yourself
we're in the fucking pits.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.056
We just got blown out by the
worst team in the league, so...

24:35.140 --> 24:36.766
Well, not anymore.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.977
They beat us.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.479
Alright, we're sitting
on a pile of coal.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.523
We put on our big boy pants,

24:43.607 --> 24:46.401
we put our heads together,
and we press out
a diamond in Boston.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.652
What's gonna change?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.155
Huh? Me?

24:51.489 --> 24:52.949
Pat...

24:53.033 --> 24:55.035
I'm not supposed to be here.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.746
It's Jack's team.
You're Jack's guy.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.624
And Jack's coming back,
right?

25:00.707 --> 25:02.334
Few more weeks.

25:06.755 --> 25:10.217
It's the dramatist in me.
You're right.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.390
Hey. You got plans
for Christmas? Huh?

25:17.474 --> 25:18.975
No.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.185
Yes, you do.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.645
Bringing in Chinese,

25:21.728 --> 25:23.230
we're drinking a six-pack,

25:23.313 --> 25:26.274
and we're figuring out how we're
going to ruin Boston's New Year.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.276
Huh?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.570
Yeah. Yeah. Alright.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.155
Fuck Boston.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.834
What that game was
is a lesson in humility.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.087
Showboating, fancy passes.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.505
No wonder you had
all those turnovers.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.465
Ma, you wasn't even there.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.300
Christine
I know my son.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.720
She was listening on the radio.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.473
Every game.
And you better believe it.

25:58.556 --> 26:01.518
So, I might tune in on occasion.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.354
-Let me talk to you.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.107
Earvin Johnson Sr.:
We gotta talk about
that Buick deal.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.525
Been doing some research.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.902
Not sure you wanna put
your name on them cars, son.

26:10.986 --> 26:14.823
Boys on the line been saying
quality is falling off.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.077
Look, Pop, uh, thing is...

26:19.160 --> 26:22.163
I actually already
signed the deal today.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.083
Dr. Day got it worked out
real good though.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.377
He did, huh?

26:27.460 --> 26:30.171
Told you he was
helping me, didn't I?

26:30.255 --> 26:33.049
-Yeah, you mentioned that.
-Dr. There's
the man of the hour.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.886
And... the man's old man.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.014
How you doin' there,
brother Earvin?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.683
You still
workin' the line?

26:41.766 --> 26:44.269
Honest pay
for an honest day.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.979
How's your daughter
doing though?

26:46.062 --> 26:47.314
-Hm?
-Dr. Oh.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.734
-She be blessed
and highly favored.
-Pop...

26:50.817 --> 26:53.903
-Blessed on her knees.
-Hey, Pop, Pop, Pop.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.489
Why don't you let us
talk some business?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.491
I thought that's
what we do together.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.202
Dr. Day been doing right by me!

27:01.286 --> 27:04.331
We building
Magic Johnson Enterprises.

27:05.457 --> 27:09.044
It's not Magic Johnson
on my mind.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.629
You got a lot of people
in your ear, son.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.799
Ain't many of them family.
You hear me?

27:14.883 --> 27:15.967
Yeah.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.552
Yeah.

27:19.804 --> 27:20.805
Johnson Sr.: Hm?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.891
I hear you, Pop.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.727
I got this though.

27:25.810 --> 27:29.272
You gonna have the window
office right next to mine.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.107
Go get some of Mama's pie
or something, man.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.818
Stop talking
so much business.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.904
I didn't make the world.
I'm just saying the way it is,

27:35.987 --> 27:38.990
and Boston? Look, that...

27:39.074 --> 27:41.034
That fuckin' place
is worse than anywhere.

27:41.117 --> 27:44.454
Bill Russell won
the motherfuckers...

27:45.622 --> 27:47.207
11 rings!

27:47.290 --> 27:49.751
Comes home to his abode
to find the door open.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.419
They didn't even
have the decency

27:51.503 --> 27:54.255
to burn a cross
on this man's lawn.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.133
Just shit in his bed.
Not dog shit neither.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.885
Man shit.

27:58.968 --> 28:00.303
Yeah...

28:00.387 --> 28:02.639
different kinda
white people over there.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.516
See, Boston Garden,

28:04.599 --> 28:07.977
brothers walk into that place
and you can feel it

28:08.061 --> 28:09.979
like a cold wind.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.941
You find yourself
running down the court,

28:13.024 --> 28:15.276
tripping over thin air.
Go to dribble,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.904
ball don't bounce.
Just sticks there.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.240
Like a mud puddle.

28:20.323 --> 28:23.618
No logical explanation
to it neither. But then,

28:23.701 --> 28:25.954
you hear something.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.164
-Like a little giggle.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.999
Take that, nigga!

28:32.627 --> 28:33.711
And it ain't ghosts.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.463
It's a leprechaun.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.800
I believe it.
I definitely believe it.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.552
Dr.
Look at this
Buick contract here.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.554
See your name.
That's number one.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.180
-Mm-hmm.
-Your likeness?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.808
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's go right here.
See that right there?

28:46.891 --> 28:49.769
-Mm-hmm!
-Television. Commercial.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.188
United States and Europe.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.649
-International, boy.

28:54.732 --> 28:58.278
-You international.
That's international, boy!
-Yeah!

28:58.361 --> 28:59.779
Dr.
Hold on, wait a minute.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.449
-Whoo! Yeah.
-We didn't get to
the best part yet.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.993
Dr.
Ain't nobody makin'

29:05.076 --> 29:06.536
one more second...

29:06.619 --> 29:07.871
-that kinda money.
-Whoo!

29:07.954 --> 29:09.289
Big fella,

29:09.372 --> 29:11.040
let me know if you want seconds.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.625
These are thirds.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.295
What I need now is a recipe

29:15.378 --> 29:18.006
-before I eat you
out of house and home.
-Earvin Sr.: Please.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.342
The great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.386
More than welcome to it.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.473
Still smile to think of
my own son passing the ball

29:26.556 --> 29:29.517
to the greatest center
ever played the game.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.979
-No need for that.
-Hey. Truth is truth.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.064
He's not so bad himself.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.568
-No...
-What up!

29:38.651 --> 29:40.487
I guess he ain't.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.947
Can I ask you a question,
Mr. Johnson?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.116
-Merry Christmas!
-Oh, yeah, here he is!

29:45.200 --> 29:46.326
Y'all enjoyin'
y'all selves?

29:46.409 --> 29:48.620
You can if you can cut
that Mr. Johnson crap

29:48.703 --> 29:50.830
and just call me Earvin.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.710
Your son.
Has he always been so...

29:57.545 --> 29:58.546
happy?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.715
Mm! Mm! Hey!

30:00.798 --> 30:02.759
Junior?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.095
Only since his first breath.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.390
Doctor slapped his ass,

30:09.474 --> 30:12.101
he turned around
and smiled back.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.311
Hey! You heard?

30:13.394 --> 30:15.605
-I can imagine.
-Earvin Sr.: Yeah.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.609
Something on your chest,
Mr. Jabbar?

30:19.692 --> 30:21.027
Kareem.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.279
Kareem.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.698
I just can't say
I'm accustomed to it.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.743
Most men I know,
Black men,

30:29.452 --> 30:31.204
we laugh,

30:31.287 --> 30:34.749
enjoy our lives.
But, America does...

30:34.832 --> 30:37.460
things to
a man's mind and soul

30:37.544 --> 30:39.254
that aren't happy.

30:41.714 --> 30:44.926
Pardon my saying it,
but your son...

30:46.094 --> 30:49.305
-seems unaffected by all that.
-Mm.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.891
'Cause he is.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.269
-How?
-Wish I knew.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.938
I'm from Mississippi.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.732
Down there, we're gator bait.

30:59.816 --> 31:03.236
Wasn't a week went by when
I was young ain't seen some...

31:10.285 --> 31:13.705
-Then you know.
-Too well. But he don't.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.918
Not like that.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.587
And it

31:20.670 --> 31:24.716
feels like we ain't speaking
the same tongue sometimes but...

31:26.384 --> 31:29.971
then I think, hey,
maybe that's a blessing, too.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.100
When it don't scare me shitless.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.605
I'll whoop his ass
if he gets out of line.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.566
Yeah, no kidding, though...

31:41.649 --> 31:43.651
I want you to do just that.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.446
Pull out some of
that karate shit.

31:46.529 --> 31:48.448
Got too many people
barking up his tree right now.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.867
He helping build
Magic Johnson Enterprises!

31:50.950 --> 31:53.328
You'd actually be
doing me a favor.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.539
Count on it.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.541
My man!

32:02.003 --> 32:04.130
Hey, Rhonda!

32:05.048 --> 32:06.674
-Yo girl! What's up?
-Hey.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.759
How you doing?
Where Cookie at?

32:07.842 --> 32:09.344
You all was both
at the game, right?

32:09.427 --> 32:11.596
Guess she has
someplace else to be.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.848
Great game, though.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.309
-It was fun seeing you.
-Yeah.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.810
You, too.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.146
See you around, Rhonda.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.616
Remember what I said
about the Garden.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.534
Right? You're not just playing
the guys on the floor.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.787
-You're playing the arena.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.748
Playing the whole goddamn city.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.376
-Mm-hmm.
-You know. And the refs,
too, right?

32:41.459 --> 32:43.670
Because they're gonna give
the home team every call,

32:43.753 --> 32:45.588
and the crowd's
gonna go so nuts,

32:45.672 --> 32:47.173
it's going to seem
like they deserve it.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.551
So, you just gotta
stay on top of 'em.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.638
Huh?
Right from the tip.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.934
-Right, Paul?

32:59.227 --> 33:00.937
-Right?

33:01.020 --> 33:02.355
-Right?
-Hm? Right.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.899
I heard you. Yeah.

33:04.982 --> 33:06.025
Work the tip.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.236
Work the refs!
Work the refs!

33:08.319 --> 33:10.321
I didn't say blow 'em!

33:10.405 --> 33:12.532
Hey, we got a chance here.

33:12.615 --> 33:15.827
Okay? Can win with this.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.912
-But not if they
get every foul call

33:17.995 --> 33:19.997
and spend the whole night
shooting free throws.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.875
You're the sixth man
on the floor.
Remember that.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.505
-Yup.
-Operator
I have a call for Mr. West

33:27.588 --> 33:30.758
-from an Elgin Baylor.
-No, Mr. West is in another...

33:32.051 --> 33:33.636
Uh...

33:33.720 --> 33:36.848
-Actually, put it
through, please.
-Connecting.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.183
Elgin Baylor
What you say there,
Tweety Bird?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.770
Waiting on the red-eye,
but my flight's delayed.

33:44.981 --> 33:47.191
Elg. It's Pat.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.611
-What's up, man?
You got the wrong room.
-Riles!

33:50.695 --> 33:52.530
-What's happening?
-You know, just, uh,

33:52.613 --> 33:55.032
packing up for Boston.
What's up?

33:55.116 --> 33:58.369
Yeah. Zeke said you come down
to the bench to fill the void.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.079
Shouldn't be too long now.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.749
Be seeing Buss tomorrow,
get you back on the mic

34:02.832 --> 34:04.751
with Chick where you belong.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.627
You mind telling Zeke
I'm running late?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.296
I'm all outta dimes!

34:08.379 --> 34:09.881
Uh, yeah.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.341
Yeah, sure, Elg.
Bye.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.343
I'll see you in Boston!

34:32.069 --> 34:33.571
Elgin Baylor.

34:33.654 --> 34:37.241
Says he's flying out
to meet Buss.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.620
When did you know they were
looking for replacements?

34:40.703 --> 34:44.290
-Spit that shit out of
your mouth and answer me!
-Okay...

34:44.373 --> 34:46.626
I thought we had more time.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.212
-You know they
were talking to him?
-Somebody.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.631
-When you told me
to quit my job for this?
-I-I didn't...

34:51.714 --> 34:54.592
-I didn't think
that it was gonna--
-You--

34:54.675 --> 34:56.511
-You know they weren't
keeping Jack.
-No!

34:56.594 --> 34:58.805
-You knew it.
-No.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.431
Jack told me that Buss
was giving us a shot,

35:00.515 --> 35:02.517
-and that if we could
pull things out in Boston--
-Now what?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.770
-I go back to wandering
the fucking beach?!
-I needed you!

35:05.853 --> 35:07.688
Jack begged me.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.482
He's fighting for
his fucking life,

35:09.565 --> 35:11.734
and they're going to
take it away because of me!

35:11.818 --> 35:16.155
Because I cannot hack it
by myself! I can't!

35:16.239 --> 35:18.241
-But you...
-You fuckin' lied to me.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.576
Would you be here
if you knew that they were

35:20.660 --> 35:22.787
fucking sharpening
their knives?!

35:22.870 --> 35:25.706
No. You'd be staring
at Chick's fist!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.291
And what for, Pat?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.252
You are not an announcer.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.795
You are a coach!

35:31.712 --> 35:33.214
You're my coach.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.424
No, I'm your fucking nanny.

35:37.802 --> 35:38.928
You wanna coach?

35:39.011 --> 35:40.513
-Please don't--
-You wanna fucking coach?

35:40.596 --> 35:42.431
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

35:43.641 --> 35:45.143
-You wanna be a coach?!
-It's fucking cold!

35:45.226 --> 35:46.727
Huh? You wanna be a coach?

35:46.811 --> 35:48.938
-Yes, please...
-Good! Do something about it!

35:49.021 --> 35:50.940
-Turn off the fucking water!
-Stand up!

35:51.023 --> 35:54.026
Stand up for your fucking team!
You hear me? Stand up!

35:54.110 --> 35:56.571
-You wanna keep
this fucking job?
-Yes...

35:56.654 --> 35:58.531
-Do you wanna keep it?
-Yes.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.658
Then you fucking yell!
Yell it!

36:00.741 --> 36:01.909
Yes!

36:03.661 --> 36:05.872
There's your fucking
wakeup call!

36:06.622 --> 36:07.540
Now answer it!

36:19.093 --> 36:20.928
Fuck...

36:33.316 --> 36:34.984
Hey, I'm coming.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.070
Oh...

36:39.572 --> 36:41.407
What you doing here, Cook?

36:41.490 --> 36:43.034
You disappointed?

36:44.452 --> 36:47.288
You a little late.

36:47.371 --> 36:51.167
Yeah. I'm sorry
about last night.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.919
Didn't miss much anyway.

36:54.086 --> 36:55.880
Wish I coulda skipped
that game myself.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.590
Who said I did?

36:57.673 --> 36:59.634
Bought me a cheap seat.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.427
You ...

37:01.510 --> 37:03.179
You crazy, girl! Wha...

37:03.262 --> 37:05.806
Got you in first class
and everything!

37:05.890 --> 37:09.018
I woulda hit a couple
shots for you.
Instead, I be breaking 'em.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.311
Don't put that on me now.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.355
Just sayin'.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.522
Been missing you.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.025
Nah, don't start.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.903
You out there on another planet.
The world on a string.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.864
Just... What you need me for?

37:21.948 --> 37:24.158
Just to say you can?

37:24.241 --> 37:26.494
-Ain't like that, Cook.
-Then, what is it?

37:28.037 --> 37:30.206
Because last night,
I was watching.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.458
Not the game. You.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.294
The way the world
moves around you.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.171
Big people, little people,

37:37.254 --> 37:39.674
just circling you like the Sun.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.175
And for you, it's...

37:41.259 --> 37:43.844
it's as natural
as breathing.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.554
And I just...

37:45.638 --> 37:48.391
don't know where
I fit in all that.

37:48.474 --> 37:49.976
Right here, Cook.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.312
With me.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.565
Until the bus leaves.
Then what?

37:58.150 --> 38:00.319
What am I to you?

38:00.403 --> 38:02.780
'Cause, honest to God, Earvin,
I don't have the first idea.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.490
-I'm tired--
-Cook!

38:07.660 --> 38:08.995
My girl.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.669
You family, Cook.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.711
I know.
That bus is waiting.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.258
Call you from Boston?

39:09.680 --> 39:12.641
-Once you whoop that
white boy's butt. Yeah.
-Mm.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.731
Okay. I'm gonna go.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.483
Mm-mmm.
You ain't going nowhere.

39:20.566 --> 39:23.486
-I gotta go.
-Alright, alright.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.129
Who was that?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.636
Uh... Teammate.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.680
-Oh.
-Yeah.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.890
They waitin'.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.237
Boston Fan
Have a nice day.
Go fuck yourself.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.824
Boston Fan
Lakers suck!

40:09.907 --> 40:11.992
Boston Fan
You fuckin' suck, Magic!

40:12.076 --> 40:13.619
Boston Fan
Don't even have a coach.

40:13.702 --> 40:16.038
Boston Fan
Westhead sucks.
Get outta here!

40:16.122 --> 40:18.791
Boston Fan
Kareem, you are
fucked as shit.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.251
Welcome to Boston.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.378
Boston Fan
Larry is gonna kill you guys.

40:22.461 --> 40:23.504
Bunch of pricks.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.216
Paul Revere shoulda slept in.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.677
Let the British burn

40:29.760 --> 40:32.012
this fuck-hole
to the ground.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.473
When does Elgin
need an answer?

40:34.557 --> 40:37.810
Tonight.
He's sitting on another offer.

40:37.893 --> 40:41.480
Yeah. The fact is,
we waited long enough.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.774
-Sooner we cut--
-We? Who's we, Jerry?

40:43.858 --> 40:46.193
Okay, okay, fine. Your team.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.322
Jack McKinney beat me
at Monopoly.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.867
-It's a kid's game.
-It's a game of strategy.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.870
He kicked my ass.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.539
Guy can't tie
his fucking shoe...

41:01.041 --> 41:02.418
Nobody beats me at Monopoly.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.794
Okay...

41:03.878 --> 41:05.087
Except my mother.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.881
-She's the only fucking one.
-Okay, look, Doc,

41:06.964 --> 41:08.382
I fucking-- I get it, okay?
I understand

41:08.465 --> 41:10.259
this is the shit
part of the gig.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.303
Working the guillotine.

41:12.386 --> 41:13.721
Do you know why
we lost to Boston

41:13.804 --> 41:16.056
all those years?
My team, my team.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.851
Because we lost the first one.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.562
Had a better squad,
more talent.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.565
But, we let it get away from us.

41:24.648 --> 41:27.026
Once.
And that shit stays with you

41:27.109 --> 41:29.904
like a stink inside
a fuckin' jersey.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.114
You let that happen here,

41:32.198 --> 41:34.700
you can't wash it out.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.747
Ah. Home, sweet home.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.417
Well, thanks for
the pep talk, Jerry.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.295
I'm staying in
the fucking car.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.714
I reckoned.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.967
Oh my god, is that blood?

41:53.719 --> 41:56.347
-What the fuck is that?!

41:56.430 --> 41:57.890
Told you, motherfucker.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.767
Leprechaun.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.477
'Cause he's comin' for you!

42:01.560 --> 42:03.562
Fuck this, man.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.011
Yo, what's up, Larry?

42:39.848 --> 42:41.850
Let's get this shit over.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.894
Larry! Larry! Larry, over here!

42:43.978 --> 42:45.354
-Still mad, I see.
-Larry!

42:45.437 --> 42:47.273
Larry! Question!

42:47.356 --> 42:49.942
-What'd you eat before the game?
-Larry Food.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.944
-Larry, who's gonna guard you?
-Who cares?

42:52.027 --> 42:54.196
-Larry, what's your prediction?
-We're gonna win.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.031
Larry, what do you wanna
say about the game?

42:56.115 --> 42:58.117
-We're gonna play the game.
-Larry, you gonna win tonight?

42:58.200 --> 43:01.203
-Yep.
-Aw, come on. Any jitters?

43:01.287 --> 43:02.579
-Nope.
-Magic! Magic!

43:02.663 --> 43:04.456
What do you think about Larry?

43:04.540 --> 43:07.751
-You thinkin' about
the strategy, Larry?
-Just another game.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.671
Gonna be a good one though.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.674
Two great teams. Great rivals.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.718
That don't get you goin',
you ain't got a pulse.

43:19.888 --> 43:23.100
I'm gonna rip your
fucking ass a new hole.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.688
One more! Larry! Lar!

43:38.115 --> 43:40.117
Dude don't say two words.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.827
Don't smile.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.121
Don't even try.

43:44.204 --> 43:45.539
And they love him anyway.

43:45.622 --> 43:47.541
Like I ain't even there.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.171
The Invisible Man.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.214
Just like the movie.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.009
There's a book, too.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.470
Point remains.
Hard for them to see you

43:59.553 --> 44:02.389
-when they're blinded
by the white.
-But that's the thing!

44:02.473 --> 44:04.058
I'm the dude that they did see!

44:04.141 --> 44:07.227
Bused me to an all-white school.
I ain't wanna go!

44:07.311 --> 44:10.189
But I ain't about to
let that stop me neither!

44:10.272 --> 44:12.274
So I made me somebody they see.

44:12.358 --> 44:13.984
You have a knack for that.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.652
Cap, I'm...

44:17.404 --> 44:19.156
Look, I know you ain't about it.

44:19.239 --> 44:21.367
I know you all
think I'm fake.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.410
And I don't know, Cap, may--

44:24.912 --> 44:27.831
Maybe you right.
Maybe you all are right.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.958
I should just stick
to playing ball.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.377
-Maybe.
-Yep.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.004
Or...

44:34.088 --> 44:36.173
you could go out there
and beat his ass.

44:36.256 --> 44:38.509
What?

44:38.592 --> 44:39.843
They gonna love me then?

44:39.927 --> 44:42.721
Fuck. No.

44:42.805 --> 44:46.558
They'll double down
on his greatness.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.602
And they'll whisper yours.

44:48.685 --> 44:51.355
If they say anything at all.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.232
Thing is...

44:55.025 --> 44:57.069
that silence?

44:57.152 --> 44:58.987
That's not invisibility.

45:01.615 --> 45:04.118
It's power.

45:08.997 --> 45:11.667
Cap, we need straight-up
fundamental defense in the post.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.627
You are not gonna have
help on the weak side.

45:13.710 --> 45:16.255
And here's why. This is key.

45:16.338 --> 45:19.633
Every time Bird
touches the ball,

45:19.716 --> 45:22.636
-we want an instant trap.
-Don't let him get a shot off.

45:22.719 --> 45:24.888
-Get the fuck outta here.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.682
What? What's so funny?

45:26.765 --> 45:28.100
-Is there a problem, guys?
-Bird.

45:28.183 --> 45:30.561
Yeah, I know. That's why
we're gonna double.

45:30.644 --> 45:33.772
Nah, man. Problem is y'all
act like he's God's gift.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.774
Cracker can't even jump.
Slow as snail shit.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.943
Potsie over there
can lock his ass down.

45:38.026 --> 45:39.736
I don't know, man.
I think Bird's the real deal.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.113
Aw, man, shut your ass up.

45:41.196 --> 45:42.573
Me and Country gonna
switch off, pick-to-pick,

45:42.656 --> 45:45.492
-split him between us.
-Mm-mmm. Not tonight.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.703
-He mine.
-Hey, listen up to
your coach. Come on.

45:47.786 --> 45:51.165
Listen, that is the--
the can-do attitude
that we need.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.583
It is.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.042
But, it is not the game plan.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.170
Fuck the game plan.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.504
I got him, Coach!

45:57.588 --> 45:59.506
Everybody's scared
of goddamn Larry Bird!

45:59.590 --> 46:02.593
-I beat him before,
I'll beat him again!

46:02.676 --> 46:06.638
Yo, we need to focus up!
Everyone needs to focus up
right now.

46:22.112 --> 46:24.615
Well...

46:24.698 --> 46:26.492
Nice seats.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.243
Red knows how
to treat a guest.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.662
Mr. Auerbach can't make
it up to see youse guys.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.373
He sent you this
with his regards.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.210
Is it gonna explode?

46:36.293 --> 46:38.712
Red wouldn't blow up anything
he'd have to pay for.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.714
Alright, I'll bite.

46:40.797 --> 46:42.591
It's a vegetable.

46:42.674 --> 46:44.426
Like your coach.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.303
Welcome to the Garden.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.432
-Very funny.

47:14.581 --> 47:16.416
Chick
This is Chick Hearn
for the LA Lakers

47:16.500 --> 47:19.336
coming to you live
from beautiful Beantown,

47:19.419 --> 47:20.712
the city of Boston.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.506
Johnny
Johnny Most at
the Garden here,

47:22.589 --> 47:25.259
where your pride of Boston
is rarin' to wipe the floor

47:25.342 --> 47:28.011
with everybody's favorite
LA softies.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.846
-Team!
-Let's go!

47:32.349 --> 47:34.393
-Hey, fuck you!
-Yeah!

47:35.310 --> 47:37.479
Suck my dick, Magic!

47:37.563 --> 47:39.106
Alright, fellas, let's go!

47:43.819 --> 47:46.113
Gonna wipe that smile
off your face.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.663
-What's up, Larry?
-Let's go! Let's go!

47:56.039 --> 47:58.417
-Welcome to Boston.
-Gonna make this is my house.

48:01.378 --> 48:02.963
-Fucker.

48:03.046 --> 48:04.298
Yes!

48:04.381 --> 48:05.632
Lakers draw first blood

48:05.716 --> 48:07.050
but here comes Larry Bird.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.427
Trap, trap, trap!

48:08.510 --> 48:10.095
And he walks
right into a trap.

48:10.178 --> 48:12.472
Magic with the steal.

48:12.556 --> 48:15.392
To Cooper.
Slam dunk!

48:15.475 --> 48:17.185
And the Lakers
come out swinging,

48:17.269 --> 48:19.479
but the boys from Boston
will make this one a contest.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.940
If that's the Lakers'
best shot, good riddance.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.360
-D up!
-Come on, let's go!

48:25.444 --> 48:28.280
Okay, fuckers, y'all can't
stop me, so I'll tell you
what I'm about to do.

48:28.363 --> 48:31.366
Fake left, drive right,
jumper from 12. No rim.

48:35.495 --> 48:37.748
-Fuck.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.877
Shit, think that was 13.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.671
-That leprechaun's for real.
-You're looking at him.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.173
Get ready,
you Hollywood pansies,

48:46.256 --> 48:47.591
-Fuck!
-...here comes...

48:47.674 --> 48:49.176
Fuckin' had enough
of this fuckin' shit.

48:49.259 --> 48:52.554
Just fucking breathe,
Jerry, breathe...

48:54.514 --> 48:56.516
-Good!
-Wicked shooter, huh?

48:56.600 --> 48:59.353
Oh! F... Fucking motherfucking

48:59.436 --> 49:01.021
-son of a fucking bitch!

49:01.104 --> 49:04.107
I shoulda fucking known!
Somebody fucking
settin' me up here!

49:04.191 --> 49:06.193
Abdul-Jabbar
on the fast break.

49:06.276 --> 49:07.653
Team one for Chaney.

49:07.736 --> 49:09.154
I tell you, these refs
must be blind.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.822
Another good no-call
by the officials! Ha!

49:10.906 --> 49:13.492
Motherfucker!
What is you doing?

49:13.575 --> 49:15.869
-Use the goddamn whistle!
-Please, ref. Please!

49:18.538 --> 49:21.708
Fuckin' fuckin' fuck!

49:21.792 --> 49:23.877
And this is just
an abomination.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.754
Jamaal taking
a football blow.

49:25.837 --> 49:27.756
Somehow,
no whistle from the refs.

49:27.839 --> 49:29.007
Absolutely despicable.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.592
...not letting the Lakers
get away with dirty tricks.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.057
Nixon tripped
and takes a header.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.308
Not a whistle to be heard.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.018
Boy, if I didn't
know any better,

49:40.102 --> 49:41.937
I'd say these refs
were on the Boston payroll.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.438
Call it,
call the fuckin'--

49:43.522 --> 49:46.191
This is the best officiated
game in years!

49:46.274 --> 49:48.360
This cornbread
motherfucker--

49:48.443 --> 49:50.362
Cooper trips over his feet.

49:50.445 --> 49:52.531
These Lakers are looking
awfully clumsy tonight.

49:52.614 --> 49:54.324
Officials are swallowing
their whistles once again.

49:54.408 --> 49:58.036
Shut down the fuckin' act,
you motherfucker!

49:58.120 --> 50:00.706
Johnson looking desperate
under the rim.

50:00.789 --> 50:03.083
Open your fuckin' eyes!

50:03.166 --> 50:04.126
He's on his arm!

50:04.209 --> 50:06.044
And Johnson hits the deck,

50:06.128 --> 50:07.838
making a show of it
for the officials

50:07.921 --> 50:09.589
but they're not buying
what he's selling.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.966
Fuckin' call it!

50:11.049 --> 50:12.426
Goddamn it.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.678
This fiddle-faddle officiating
may cost the Lakers the game.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.805
But the refs call it
like they see it

50:16.888 --> 50:19.975
and what they see is good,
clean fun from Boston.

50:22.185 --> 50:23.437
Another--

50:23.520 --> 50:24.771
It's just a fuckin' game, Jerry.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.732
Nothing but net!

50:26.815 --> 50:29.317
Boston boy is on fire tonight!

50:29.401 --> 50:31.778
Celtics fan:
Go home, you fuckin' pussies!

50:31.862 --> 50:33.655
Third quarter,
and the Celtics...

50:33.739 --> 50:35.615
-God fuck.
-...for a commanding lead.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.951
If substitute coach
Paul Westhead

50:38.034 --> 50:40.412
wants to prove
he's not just wearing diapers,

50:40.495 --> 50:42.539
now's his chance
to put on big-boy pants

50:42.622 --> 50:44.416
and raise his hand.

50:44.499 --> 50:47.002
You gotta make a sub.
Make a sub.

50:53.425 --> 50:54.968
Wood.

50:56.553 --> 50:59.222
After an onslaught of
egregious uncalled fouls

50:59.306 --> 51:01.892
for the boys in green,
Spencer Haywood
has had enough.

51:01.975 --> 51:03.894
He's gonna
clean it up himself, folks.

51:03.977 --> 51:05.645
Johnson passes to Haywood.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.481
Haywood with
a hand-off to Nixon.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.858
Nixon, jumper. It's good!

51:11.985 --> 51:13.695
Bird hooks by Coop
with an elbow.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.823
No call. Oh!
He ran into a brick wall
in Spencer Haywood.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.576
-Boom!
-The dropped shoulder
laid Bird on his back!

51:19.659 --> 51:22.454
Bird looks like he's had
just about enough of this.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.539
...Bird chucks the ball at
Spencer, throwing a tantrum.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.999
Punches are being thrown.

51:26.082 --> 51:27.667
The Celtics
are throwing punches.

51:27.751 --> 51:30.337
We've got fisticuffs, folks.
The benches are clear.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.756
The Celtics are absolutely
out of control.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.259
The Lakers are acting
like hoodlums, hoodlums!

51:36.343 --> 51:39.346
-And here's a late
whistle from the officials.

51:39.429 --> 51:41.181
Technical foul
on Spencer Haywood.

51:41.264 --> 51:43.266
It's a technical
on Spencer Haywood.

51:43.350 --> 51:44.351
Well, I cannot
believe my eyes.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.102
No! That was 33!
Come on, ref!

51:46.186 --> 51:49.064
You gotta get in there!
Hey! Hey, Earl!

51:49.147 --> 51:51.483
You blind fuck!
Now, you see us,
do you, huh?

51:51.566 --> 51:53.985
Now--
Halle-fucking-lujah!

51:54.069 --> 51:56.530
-It's a miracle.
-Welcome back, Pat.

51:56.613 --> 51:59.157
-Enjoy your first tech.

52:09.543 --> 52:12.712
Bravo! At least
he fucking earned it!

52:12.796 --> 52:14.840
That's your first
honest call of the night!

52:14.923 --> 52:17.759
Watch it, Coach!
I'm about to throw you
out of this game.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.845
You've been
screwing us all night!

52:19.928 --> 52:22.013
-- What did you say?
-- Paul. That's enough!

52:22.097 --> 52:24.224
I said I was screwing
your wife last night!

52:24.307 --> 52:26.643
-Shit!

52:26.726 --> 52:28.228
You're outta here!

52:28.311 --> 52:30.188
It's okay. It's okay.

52:30.272 --> 52:32.816
You're up, Coach.

52:32.899 --> 52:36.027
Celtics fan: Hey, Riley!
Eat a bag of dicks, ya bitch!

52:37.779 --> 52:39.948
-Fuck Boston!

52:42.826 --> 52:44.995
Bring it in!
Calm down!

52:45.078 --> 52:46.913
Shh. Take a breath.

52:48.790 --> 52:51.126
Repeat after me. Fuck Boston.

52:51.209 --> 52:53.503
-Fuck Boston. Fuck Boston!
-Fuck Boston! Fuck Boston!

52:53.587 --> 52:56.256
-Fuck Boston! Fuck Boston!
-Fuck Boston! Fuck Boston!

52:56.339 --> 52:58.174
We're not gonna lose
this fucking game!

52:58.258 --> 53:01.094
-Get out there
and kick their ass!
-Whoo!

53:01.177 --> 53:03.597
The Lakers are fed up,
fired up,

53:03.680 --> 53:04.973
and they're fighting mad.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.600
-Yes!

53:10.020 --> 53:12.063
And a tone-shift has
happened for the Lakers here.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.648
They have reclaimed
the momentum,

53:13.732 --> 53:16.359
and Westhead
is looking commanding
on the sidelines.

53:16.443 --> 53:19.237
One blown call after another
and the officials have let

53:19.321 --> 53:21.406
the Lakers make a game of it!

53:29.331 --> 53:31.791
Alright, out of the time-out,
Lakers take the floor.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.668
Let's see what Professor
Westhead's come up with.

53:33.752 --> 53:34.961
Celtics Fan
Come on, Larry,
eat 'em up!

53:35.045 --> 53:36.630
Celtics Fan
Eat his stinkin' shit,
Lakers!

53:36.713 --> 53:38.131
Keeping it inbound,
right side.

53:38.214 --> 53:40.425
Referee hands him the ball,
looking for a place to go.

53:40.508 --> 53:43.136
He finds Magic top of the team.
Magic at the three-point line,

53:43.219 --> 53:44.971
dribbling up and down
like a yo-yo.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.349
Magic surveying the floor.
There's nowhere to go with it.

53:47.432 --> 53:48.975
The clock is winding down.
Ten seconds.

53:49.059 --> 53:51.353
Coop, set the pick!

53:51.436 --> 53:53.438
Magic makes a move,
loses Bird.

53:53.521 --> 53:55.607
No-look to Cooper. Hit hard.

53:55.690 --> 53:58.151
Throws up a prayer...

54:02.864 --> 54:04.282
Off the iron...

54:04.366 --> 54:06.993
Holy shit!

54:07.077 --> 54:09.162
-Gets a bounce
and goes in!

54:09.245 --> 54:11.122
Unbelievable!
Right at the buzzer.

54:11.206 --> 54:14.751
-Michael Cooper with
a game-winning--

54:17.295 --> 54:19.172
-Coop!
-Yes!

54:19.255 --> 54:21.716
Lakers win
a hard-fought victory

54:21.800 --> 54:24.636
here on the parquet floor
in Boston.

54:26.471 --> 54:28.515
The Lakers have
beaten biased referees,

54:28.598 --> 54:30.225
-a heated crowd...
-Fuck!

54:30.308 --> 54:31.726
They stole it from Boston!

54:31.810 --> 54:33.478
Absolutely stole it!

54:33.561 --> 54:34.980
Boy, oh, boy
is this crowd silent.

54:42.487 --> 54:43.697
Celtics fan:
Aw, fuck!

54:48.451 --> 54:52.163
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

54:52.247 --> 54:54.833
Magic Johnson is smiling
like the sun.

54:54.916 --> 54:57.377
We may be looking at
Rookie of the Year here,
folks.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.462
-Larry!
-Leave me the fuck alone.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.297
Larry, any comment
on the game?

55:02.007 --> 55:03.925
He mad, y'all.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.263
Ha, ha. Unbelievable.

55:08.346 --> 55:10.181
Wherever Jack McKinney is
watching, I hope he's proud

55:10.265 --> 55:13.476
of his team and proud
of Paul Westhead right now.

55:15.186 --> 55:17.272
Signs of life last night
for the Lakers

55:17.355 --> 55:19.357
as they managed
to defeat the Celtics

55:19.441 --> 55:21.526
on their turf in Boston.

55:30.118 --> 55:31.202
Big win.

55:33.246 --> 55:34.330
Barely.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.759
If I wait for you,

55:45.842 --> 55:47.969
and you don't make it back...

55:51.014 --> 55:53.558
then I'm stuck with Westhead.

55:53.641 --> 55:56.519
And I'm not gonna win
a title with him, am I?

56:01.149 --> 56:02.484
No.

56:03.359 --> 56:05.153
That's what I thought.

56:23.755 --> 56:26.341
We're not done
playing yet, Jack.

56:34.849 --> 56:36.267
Fuck Boston.
