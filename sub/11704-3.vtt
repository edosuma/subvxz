00:28.153 --> 00:29.112
{\an8}IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF
SHE WANTS TO HOOK UP WITH ME.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.489
{\an8}IT'S A MATTER OF JUST

00:31.573 --> 00:33.116

00:33.199 --> 00:35.535
{\an8}- SAMMI REALLY, LIKE,

00:48.548 --> 00:49.883
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD!

00:49.966 --> 00:51.176
{\an8}- THE BOYS ARE GONNA HATE ME

00:51.259 --> 00:53.261
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M GONNA KEEP
[bleep] UP THEIR GAME.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.429
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU

00:56.848 --> 00:58.308
{\an8}IT'S GETTING, LIKE,
KIND OF A LITTLE BIT INTIMATE.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.934

{\an8}SHE WON'T EVEN REMEMBER
HER BOYFRIEND'S NAME

01:03.813 --> 01:06.858
{\an8}WHEN SHE GETS DONE
WITH ME.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.784
{\an8}- JWOWW, GOOD MORNING.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.245
{\an8}- I DIPPED OFF
LAST NIGHT BY ACCIDENT.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.288
{\an8}I HAD TO SNEAK OUT.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.998
{\an8}- YOU MISSED ALL THE ACTION.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.833
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD'VE LEFT
ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER THEN.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.294
{\an8}- [scoffs] WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU JERK-OFF?

01:26.377 --> 01:27.837

{\an8}- I KNOW WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT.
I DIDN'T KISS HIM..

01:32.675 --> 01:34.219
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU MADE OUT
WITH PAULY ON STAGE.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.971
{\an8}- IN THE CLUB,
ME AND JWOWW ARE DANCING,

01:37.055 --> 01:38.014
{\an8}GRINDING ON EACH OTHER.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.307

TO MAKE OUT.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.683
{\an8}SHE'S KISSING ME.
KISSING ON MY NECK.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.728
{\an8}KISSING ON MY CHEST.
HER HANDS ARE GOING DOWNSTAIRS.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.188
{\an8}- DID SHE?
- DID I KISS YOU?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.189
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.483
{\an8}- I HAD, LIKE, THIS KNOT
IN MY STOMACH.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.236
{\an8}I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE, LIKE,
IT WAS THAT TO THE EXTENT.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.028
{\an8}BUT I WANTED TO GET
ALL THE FACTS TOGETHER

01:52.111 --> 01:55.698
{\an8}BEFORE I TOLD MY BOYFRIEND.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.033
{\an8}WHO DID YOU HOOK UP WITH?

01:57.116 --> 01:59.577
{\an8}- NO ONE. JUST YOU.
- JUST ME.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.204
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.040
{\an8}- JWOWW'S PLAYING IT OFF
LIKE SHE DIDN'T REALLY KISS ME.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.208
{\an8}SHE KNOWS VERY WELL
WHAT WE DID.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.459
{\an8}I KNOW SHE WAS COHERENT.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.627
{\an8}SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO FEEL LIKE A TRASH BAG

02:07.710 --> 02:09.795
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND
AND SHE KISSED ME

02:09.878 --> 02:12.715
{\an8}WITH THE TONGUE.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.008
{\an8}- LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.219
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY FEEL
LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE TENSION

02:16.302 --> 02:17.595
{\an8}AT WORK TODAY.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.556
{\an8}I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE AWKWARD
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE DRAMA

02:19.639 --> 02:22.559
{\an8}BETWEEN THE SITUATION
AND ME AND RONNIE.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.726
{\an8}- LATER. DRAGGING ASS.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.979
{\an8}- GET OUT OF HERE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST ON TIME.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.981
{\an8}- NO, MAN.

{\an8}- YES.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.528
{\an8}- I'M REALLY NOT JEALOUS
ABOUT SAM AND RONNIE

02:33.611 --> 02:35.780
{\an8}BECAUSE, I MEAN,
I HAD MY CHOICE, OKAY?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.073
{\an8}AND IT'S REALLY NO SWEAT
OFF MY BACK

02:37.156 --> 02:38.074

{\an8}AND I CAN PRETTY MUCH
HAVE MY CHOICE

02:40.910 --> 02:41.953

15:16.457 --> 15:17.666
{\an8}- I JUST WANT TO LEAVE.
THAT'S IT.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.544
{\an8}- I SEE RONNIE
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.505
{\an8}NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.466
{\an8}AND I WAS LIKE,
[bleep] THAT.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.514
{\an8}- WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.432
{\an8}- FIRE EVERYBODY UP.
- LET'S EAT.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.642
{\an8}LOOK AT THESE PANCAKES.
WHAT IS UP?

15:34.725 --> 15:37.519
{\an8}I HAD FUN AT HEADLINERS.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.437
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.730
{\an8}- LAST NIGHT WAS GOOD.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.190
{\an8}UM, HEADLINERS WAS COOL.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.025
{\an8}BUT ANGELINA
AND HER BOYFRIEND,

15:43.108 --> 15:44.985
{\an8}IT'S A LITTLE MORE DRAMA
THAN IT'S WORTH.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.033
{\an8}- THE KID'S A DOUCHE BAG.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.868
{\an8}HER BOYFRIEND'S A DOUCHE BAG.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.703
{\an8}- OH. [laughs]

15:54.787 --> 15:56.580
{\an8}- [whispering]
HE'S GETTING A DIVORCE.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.543
{\an8}- WHEN JWOWW TOLD ME

16:01.627 --> 16:03.379
{\an8}THAT ANGELINA'S BOYFRIEND
WAS MARRIED,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.589
{\an8}I KIND OF WAS LIKE,
NO WAY.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.716
{\an8}LIKE, ANGELINA!
LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.469
{\an8}LIKE, GET RID OF THIS KID.
HE'S NO GOOD FOR YOU.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.388
{\an8}- I THINK SHE'S JUST
A DRAMA QUEEN.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.472
{\an8}SHE JUST WANTS MAD ATTENTION
ALL THE TIME.

16:13.555 --> 16:14.515
{\an8}I KNOW HER.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.600
{\an8}- WHAT ABOUT WORK?

16:16.684 --> 16:18.102
{\an8}- WHAT?
YOU GOT WORK?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.978
{\an8}- VINNY'S SUPPOSED TO WORK
WITH ANGELINA,

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
{\an8}AND NOW IT COMES TIME
FOR HER SHIFT.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.607
{\an8}SO VINNY GOES TO WORK
ON TIME,

16:23.691 --> 16:26.276
{\an8}BUT SHE DOESN'T CARE.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.532
{\an8}- WE'LL COVER YOUR SHIFT
IN A SECOND.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.411
{\an8}- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
READY TO WORK?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.078
{\an8}- ALWAYS.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.913
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.081
{\an8}GIVE YOU A CHANCE.
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.416
{\an8}WHAT'S UP?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.000
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.001
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT?

16:43.085 --> 16:44.878
{\an8}- IF ANGELINA'S
COMING TO WORK.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.422
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S [bleep]ED UP.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.716
{\an8}- I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO A LOT OF WORK TODAY,

16:48.799 --> 16:49.550
{\an8}'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE
SHORT-STAFFED, THEN.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.676
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.636
{\an8}- SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
ALL RIGHT, SO...

16:52.720 --> 16:57.683
{\an8}- [coughs]

16:57.766 --> 16:58.934
{\an8}I'M JUST LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:59.017 --> 17:00.602
{\an8}I'M THINKING ABOUT
MY BOYFRIEND SO MUCH,

17:00.686 --> 17:01.937
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO WORK TODAY.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.189
{\an8}I JUST DON'T
WANT TO DO IT.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.315
{\an8}[coughs]

17:05.398 --> 17:07.483
{\an8}- WANT TO FIND A SHIRT
TODAY?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.444
{\an8}- I'M JUST BROWSING AROUND.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.154
{\an8}- NO, THIS STORE HAS,
LIKE, THE MOST--

17:10.237 --> 17:12.321
{\an8}OUT OF ALL THE STORES
ON THE BOARDWALK,

17:12.406 --> 17:13.866
{\an8}IT'S THE MOST HILARIOUS
THERE IS.

17:13.949 --> 17:17.953
{\an8}- DANNY, ANGELINA
DIDN'T SHOW. NOPE.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.872
{\an8}SHE'S A NO-GO.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.791
{\an8}- I'M, LIKE, TIRED.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.085
{\an8}LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO THERE.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.587
{\an8}I DIDN'T WANT TO EXPLAIN
MYSELF.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.130
{\an8}BUT I HAVE TO DO IT.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.673
{\an8}IT WAS JUST
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.469
{\an8}- WHAT TIME ZONE
ARE YOU IN?

17:33.552 --> 17:34.595
{\an8}- WHAT?

17:34.678 --> 17:35.971
{\an8}- WHAT TIME ZONE
ARE YOU IN?

17:36.054 --> 17:37.431
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD, THOUGH.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.307
{\an8}THAT'S WHY.
WHERE'S DANNY?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.308
{\an8}LIKE, I'VE BEEN SICK
ALL DAY.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.809
{\an8}- DANNY'S NOT HERE.
I'M HERE.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.394
{\an8}- OH, YOU'RE HERE?
- YEAH.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.729
{\an8}YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.897
{\an8}IF YOU--IF YOU NEED
SOMEBODY TO COVER YOUR SHIFT,

17:44.980 --> 17:45.814
{\an8}THAT'S ON YOU, MAN.
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.815
{\an8}IT'S AUGUST RIGHT NOW.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.150
{\an8}THIS IS THE TIME
WHERE I MAKE MONEY.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.028
{\an8}WOULDN'T YOU THINK
IT WAS MORE LOGICAL

17:51.111 --> 17:52.488
{\an8}TO CALL ME AN HOUR AGO?

17:52.571 --> 17:53.781
{\an8}- I DON'T FEEL GOOD.
LIKE, I--

17:53.864 --> 17:54.698
{\an8}- OKAY, BUT WHO'S
COVERING YOUR SHIFT?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.992
{\an8}- HONESTLY, LIKE,

{\an8}WHEN YOU'RE SICK, LIKE,
HONESTLY, LIKE--

17:59.036 --> 18:00.078
{\an8}- BUT ALL I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.163
{\an8}WHO'S GONNA COVER
YOUR SHIFT?

18:01.246 --> 18:02.748
{\an8}LIKE,
WHY COULDN'T YOU CALL

18:02.831 --> 18:03.707
{\an8}AND HAVE YOUR SHIFT COVERED?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.209
{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER
TO HERE.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.585
{\an8}- YOU DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER
TO YOUR OWN WORK?

18:06.668 --> 18:07.711
{\an8}- I CAME IN HERE.
I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.004
{\an8}LIKE, THERE'S PEOPLE
ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.005
{\an8}- YOU COULD HAVE
WALKED HERE.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.006
{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE--
FIRST OF ALL,

18:11.089 --> 18:12.007

18:12.090 --> 18:13.258

{\an8}- YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD,
BUT YOU WERE OUT LAST NIGHT.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.721
{\an8}- YEAH.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.181
{\an8}DON'T SAY YOU DON'T
FEEL GOOD.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.224
{\an8}- I'M NOT HUNG-OVER.
I HAD TWO DRINKS LAST NIGHT.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.351

THIS EXCUSE

18:22.434 --> 18:23.811
{\an8}THAT SHE'S SICK.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.562
{\an8}THAT IS A LAME EXCUSE.
SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.980
{\an8}- I HAD A PROBLEM LAST NIGHT
WITH, LIKE,

18:27.064 --> 18:28.148

18:28.232 --> 18:29.775

{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE TO DO WHAT I
DON'T WANT TO DO. THAT'S IT.

FOR ME TO EVEN WALK OVER THERE.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.835

I'M SORRY.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.002

{\an8}I DON'T CARE

22:22.007 --> 22:22.632
{\an8}- IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE,
THAT'S ON YOU.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.301
{\an8}IF YOU'RE THAT STUPID

22:24.384 --> 22:25.010
{\an8}THAT YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE
JERSEY SHORE IN THE SUMMERTIME,

22:25.093 --> 22:27.262
{\an8}I'M GONNA LET YOU LEAVE.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.764
{\an8}NOW WE'VE GOT NOBODY

22:28.847 --> 22:30.057
{\an8}LIKE YOU--LIKE YOU DID.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.767
{\an8}- I KNOW. I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE

22:31.850 --> 22:33.935
{\an8}- NO, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.228
{\an8}- YOU HAVE A GRAY HAIR.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.358
{\an8}WHY DO YOU HAVE

22:48.867 --> 22:49.951
{\an8}STOP BEING A [bleep].

22:50.035 --> 22:51.078
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
I WOULDN'T BE A [bleep]

22:51.161 --> 22:51.787
{\an8}IF YOU WEREN'T
A LITTLE BITCH.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.622
{\an8}- OH!

22:53.705 --> 22:54.873
{\an8}ALL RIGHT?

22:54.956 --> 22:56.416
{\an8}- HE WANTED ONE GOOD ONE IN,

22:56.500 --> 22:57.459
{\an8}- YEAH, EXACTLY.
- ONE MORE.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.627
{\an8}ONE MORE LAST HURRAH.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.878
{\an8}- ANGELINA WANTED US TO,
LIKE, BEG HER TO STAY,

22:59.961 --> 23:02.464
{\an8}BUT I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY'S
GONNA DO THAT.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.216
{\an8}IT'S ALMOST LIKE, GOOD-BYE,
GOOD RIDDANCE.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.258
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I GOTTA GO.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.552
{\an8}BYE, GUYS.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.096
{\an8}- LOVE YOU, GUYS.

23:09.179 --> 23:09.971
{\an8}- I WILL.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.640
{\an8}- GET THE [bleep]

23:18.647 --> 23:20.440
{\an8}AND I'M GLAD YOU LEFT.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.193
{\an8}SHE'S NOT A PART OF
THE JERSEY SHORE ANYMORE.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.157
{\an8}- I'LL PROBABLY REGRET
LEAVING,

23:29.241 --> 23:30.992
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE
ME LEAVING,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.285
{\an8}IT MIGHT HURT ME
IN THE END,

23:32.369 --> 23:33.787
{\an8}BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
I WANT TO DO IT.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.081
{\an8}I KNOW I'M A NICE GIRL.
I KNOW I'M FUN.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.916
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
I'M [bleep] GREAT.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.627
{\an8}I JUST FEEL LIKE HERE,
I JUST, I CAN'T DO IT.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.879
{\an8}AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

23:45.423 --> 23:48.969
{\an8}- BLESS ALL THE ROOMIES
THAT ARE STILL HERE.

23:49.052 --> 23:49.970
{\an8}[laughter]

23:50.053 --> 23:51.012

23:52.305 --> 23:54.599

{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

23:55.851 --> 23:57.227
{\an8}- LET'S EAT.
I'M HUNGRY TOO.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.855
{\an8}- ANGELINA WAS A BITCH THE
WHOLE TIME THAT SHE WAS HERE,

23:59.938 --> 24:01.314
{\an8}LIKE, MAKING FUN
OF EVERYBODY,

24:01.398 --> 24:03.400
{\an8}JUST STARTING UNNECESSARY

24:06.236 --> 24:07.028
{\an8}THEY'RE TAKING
THEIR UNDERWEAR OFF

24:07.112 --> 24:08.905
{\an8}IN THE [bleep] JACUZZI.

24:08.989 --> 24:09.698
{\an8}ARE YOU DUMB?

24:09.781 --> 24:11.700

24:11.783 --> 24:13.076

24:13.160 --> 24:15.287
{\an8}I'M ALL [bleep] NATURAL,

TO YOUR WHORES.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.249
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO.
- WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

24:19.332 --> 24:21.585

24:21.668 --> 24:22.711

24:22.794 --> 24:24.629
{\an8}- THREE MONTHS
OF A RELATIONSHIP

24:24.713 --> 24:25.213
{\an8}IS NOT WORTH LEAVING
THIS EXPERIENCE.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.299
{\an8}IT'S REALLY NOT.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.216
{\an8}- HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO COME SEE HER.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.509
{\an8}LIKE, WHAT BOYFRIEND
DOES THAT?

24:29.593 --> 24:31.011
{\an8}- AND HE'S MARRIED.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.888
{\an8}- SHE DID IT TO HERSELF.
WHO CARES?

24:32.971 --> 24:35.098
{\an8}- ANGELINA WAS LIKE
A HALF-ASSED FIRECRACKER.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.391
{\an8}IT JUST FIZZLED OUT
REAL QUICK

24:36.474 --> 24:38.226
{\an8}AND IT MADE A LOUD NOISE.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.561
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU
SUCH A HATER?

24:39.644 --> 24:40.854
{\an8}- NO ONE WANTS YOU.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.398
{\an8}- SO THAT'S THE WAY
ANGELINA WAS.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.483
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, WHO WANTS TO--
WHO'S GONNA START THE TOAST OFF?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.360
{\an8}- ENJOYING THE TIME
WE HAVE TOGETHER.

24:47.444 --> 24:47.736
{\an8}NO MORE DRAMA.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.738
{\an8}A TOAST.

24:49.821 --> 24:50.572
{\an8}- SALUD.
- CHEERS.

24:54.159 --> 24:58.580
{\an8}[line ringing]

24:58.663 --> 25:00.248
- HELLO?
- HI.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.168
- BABE, WHAT'S WRONG?

25:03.251 --> 25:05.420
- [sighs] I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.757
- COME ON, CAN YOU
[bleep] TALK TO ME?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.133
- NO, 'CAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD.
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.260
{\an8}- SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND

25:12.344 --> 25:14.054
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep] PROBLEM
COULD BE HONESTLY.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.639
{\an8}IS IT SOMEBODY ELSE?

25:15.722 --> 25:19.517
{\an8}I HOPE IT'S NOT
RELATIONSHIP-BREAKING.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.686
{\an8}- WITH TOM, I COULD
NEVER SEE MYSELF, LIKE,

25:21.770 --> 25:23.647
{\an8}PURPOSELY HURTING HIM,
'CAUSE HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.191
{\an8}BUT THE NIGHT THAT I DRANK
TOO MUCH PATRON,

25:26.274 --> 25:27.275
{\an8}I MADE OUT WITH PAULY.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.153
{\an8}I JUST SAW YOUR PENIS.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.112
{\an8}AND I THINK HE DESERVED
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.405
{\an8}FROM WHAT I HEARD,

25:32.489 --> 25:36.034
{\an8}I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE
AT A CLUB.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.786
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.956
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST
PIECE OF [bleep] IN THE WORLD.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.666
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT TO
JUST BREAK IT OFF THEN?

25:42.749 --> 25:46.336
{\an8}- UH, NO, NOT AT ALL.
IT'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.546

{\an8}I NEVER MEANT TO HURT HIM
OR BREAK HIS HEART,

{\an8}AND I HOPE I DIDN'T.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.727
{\an8}AND HE'S AN AMAZING GUY,
AND I LOVE HIM TO DEATH.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.562
{\an8}I'M ANNOUNCING IT NOW.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.190
{\an8}I TOLD TOMMY, AND HE BASICALLY
BROKE UP WITH ME.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.150
{\an8}- OH, PAULY, A PROBLEM.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.568
{\an8}- I TOLD HIM.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.320
{\an8}- YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
HONESTLY.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.031
{\an8}IF IT'S MEANT TO BE,
TOMMY WILL REALIZE

26:15.115 --> 26:17.325
{\an8}THAT THEY'RE COOL,
AND THEY'LL GET BACK TOGETHER.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.535
{\an8}SHE'S AT THE JERSEY SHORE,

{\an8}IF I DON'T HEAR FROM HIM,
I'M ROCKIN' OUT.

{\an8}- YOU'RE A SINGLE GIRL.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.500
{\an8}- THAT'S A BAD THING.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.003
{\an8}ME, SINGLE?
THAT'S BAD.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.297
{\an8}I GUESS I'M SINGLE.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.465
{\an8}IF I AM, WE'VE GOT
A PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS

{\an8}THEN IT'S NO-HOLDS.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.563

26:53.820 --> 26:55.447
{\an8}- IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME
EITHER WAY.

{\an8}THE FACT THAT JWOWW BROKE UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

26:58.033 --> 26:59.409
{\an8}IT JUST MEANS THAT
SHE'LL FEEL LESS GUILTY NOW

27:01.453 --> 27:03.913
