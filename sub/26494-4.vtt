WEBVTT

00:01.165 --> 00:04.132
Sammy, it's me.

00:06.637 --> 00:08.670
I don't remember most
of what Michael did

00:08.672 --> 00:11.673
because I was underwater,
drowning...

00:11.675 --> 00:13.508
and that I remember.

00:13.510 --> 00:16.044
I felt every second
of it.

00:16.046 --> 00:18.580
Why would Michael
give up his vessel like that?

00:18.582 --> 00:20.482
I don't know.

00:20.484 --> 00:23.318
- Ghosts 101.
- Ghost possession.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.920
Definitely a ghost.

00:24.922 --> 00:26.154
Somebody's spirit
can attach itself

00:26.156 --> 00:27.689
to an object
or a bunch of objects.

00:27.691 --> 00:29.357
Everything has a weakness.

00:29.359 --> 00:31.660
They hate
iron and salt.

00:31.662 --> 00:34.096
Whatever happens,
you stay inside this circle.

00:38.402 --> 00:40.569
- Where's the spear?!
- So Michael wants the spear

00:40.571 --> 00:42.504
because he knows
it can hurt him.

00:42.506 --> 00:43.438
You're no different
than him.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.006
I am nothing like him.

00:47.544 --> 00:49.111
<i>Do you</i>
<i>have unwanted gold</i>

00:49.113 --> 00:51.246
<i>just lying around the house,</i>
<i>collecting dust?</i>

00:51.248 --> 00:53.582
<i>Why not turn that gold</i>
<i>into cash?</i>

00:53.584 --> 00:55.117
<i>Here at Diamond Dave's,</i>

00:55.119 --> 00:57.085
<i>you can have cash</i>
<i>in your hands today.</i>

00:57.087 --> 00:58.954
<i>We'll take anything</i>
<i>you want to sell us.</i>

00:58.956 --> 01:00.922
<i>When Aunt Gloria</i>
<i>passed away,</i>

01:00.924 --> 01:03.291
<i>she left me so much jewelry,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:03.293 --> 01:05.126
<i>That's when I called</i>
<i>Diamond Dave.</i>

01:05.129 --> 01:07.696
<i>If it's gold,</i>
<i>it's cash in your hands.</i>

01:07.698 --> 01:10.932
<i>You're watching Shocker TV.</i>

01:12.736 --> 01:16.238
<i>This week on Shocker,</i>
<i>it's gonna be a blood bath.</i>

01:16.240 --> 01:18.573
<i>We've got slicing and dicing.</i>

01:18.575 --> 01:21.376
<i>We've got scream queens</i>
<i>and killing machines,</i>

01:21.378 --> 01:24.079
<i>24 hours a day, all week long.</i>

01:24.081 --> 01:27.215
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

01:57.681 --> 01:59.815
Whoa.

01:59.817 --> 02:02.951
Mezco 15" Mega-Scale Panthro.

02:02.953 --> 02:04.486
So handsome.

02:04.488 --> 02:06.354
So angry.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.480
Hey, Sam.

02:32.482 --> 02:34.382
<i>Stuart,</i>
<i>what did you do?</i>

02:34.384 --> 02:35.650
I...

02:35.652 --> 02:36.952
Uh, nothing.

02:36.954 --> 02:38.520
<i>Really?</i>

02:38.522 --> 02:40.222
<i>Because according to Yelp</i>

02:40.224 --> 02:43.358
<i>and this awesome,</i>
<i>one-star review we just got,</i>

02:43.360 --> 02:46.962
<i>you screamed at a customer</i>
<i>and called him a, quote,</i>

02:46.964 --> 02:50.565
<i>"mongoloid Tribble</i>
<i>in a robotic exoskeleton</i>

02:50.567 --> 02:53.301
<i>built by Tony Stark's</i>
<i>inbred third cousin."</i>

02:53.303 --> 02:54.836
<i>Which is not cool,</i>

02:54.838 --> 02:56.905
<i>and weirdly,</i>
<i>creepily specific.</i>

02:56.907 --> 02:59.574
That --

02:59.576 --> 03:01.409
He said I couldn't
beat up Superman.

03:01.411 --> 03:04.746
<i>Okay. Again,</i>
<i>Superman is not real.</i>

03:04.748 --> 03:06.381
Okay.
That's not the point.

03:06.383 --> 03:08.149
<i>And I have seen you</i>
<i>get winded eating a taco.</i>

03:08.151 --> 03:09.684
Okay, that doesn't matter.

03:09.686 --> 03:11.920
If I had kryptonite gloves,
I could beat up Superman.

03:11.922 --> 03:14.756
Anyone could.
That's science, Sam.

03:14.758 --> 03:18.426
<i>Look, I --</i>
<i>I like that you care --</i>

03:18.428 --> 03:20.328
<i>really, really care</i>
<i>about this stuff,</i>

03:20.330 --> 03:23.531
<i>but we need every customer</i>
<i>we can get, okay?</i>

03:23.533 --> 03:27.302
<i>So just chill</i>
<i>a little, please.</i>

03:29.706 --> 03:31.840
Yeah, um...

03:31.842 --> 03:34.042
Okay.

03:34.044 --> 03:37.779
I'm sorry, Sam. I just --
I just get spun out sometimes.

03:37.781 --> 03:40.115
<i>I know.</i>

03:40.117 --> 03:41.383
Coming to game night?

03:41.385 --> 03:43.351
<i>Of course.</i>

03:43.353 --> 03:45.186
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

04:19.990 --> 04:24.559
Yeah, well,
all I'm hearing is excuses.

04:24.561 --> 04:28.797
Okay, look, I don't
care about traffic, okay?!

04:28.799 --> 04:31.433
It has been
over 30 minutes, so --

04:31.435 --> 04:32.801

Uh, what you doing?

06:29.686 --> 06:31.719
Horror marathon
on Shocker.

06:31.721 --> 06:33.121
Just made my way
through the "Halloweens"

06:33.123 --> 06:35.590
and now I'm about to --

06:37.360 --> 06:39.060
Oh, wow.

06:39.062 --> 06:42.063
What?

06:42.065 --> 06:44.966
Oh, yes, I shaved.

06:44.968 --> 06:46.534
I mean, it's so smooth.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.571
It's like a...
dolphin's belly.

06:49.573 --> 06:51.106
Yeah, yeah.

06:51.108 --> 06:54.109
Hey, um...

06:54.111 --> 06:57.312
I wanted to check up on you.
You doing okay?

06:57.314 --> 06:58.646
I mean, y-you haven't really
come out of your room

06:58.648 --> 07:01.082
in almost a week.

07:01.084 --> 07:05.420
Well, since when is "okay"
a part of this job, huh?

07:05.422 --> 07:08.089
Yeah, Cass, is, you know,
showing Jack the ropes

07:08.091 --> 07:10.091
and Dark Kaia and her spear
are in the wind

07:10.093 --> 07:11.459
and we have no clue
where Michael is

07:11.461 --> 07:13.928
or what he's up to.

07:13.930 --> 07:15.630
And, not that
I'm complaining,

07:15.632 --> 07:17.232
but...

07:17.234 --> 07:22.904
the house is full
of strangers, so...

07:22.906 --> 07:25.673
So your plan is
to just lay in here,

07:25.675 --> 07:27.942
watching "Hatchet Man" movies,
seriously?

07:27.944 --> 07:29.477
"All Saints' Day"
is a classic.

07:29.479 --> 07:31.813
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

07:31.815 --> 07:33.014
- Oh, is it?
- What do you care?

07:33.016 --> 07:34.682
You don't even like
scary movies.

07:34.684 --> 07:38.219
Well, yeah, Dean,
our <i>life</i> is a scary movie.

07:38.221 --> 07:40.822
Exactly.

07:40.824 --> 07:43.424
<i>I like it when they run.</i>

07:43.426 --> 07:45.860
All right, well,
I hate to disturb your marathon,

07:45.862 --> 07:47.795
but I think
I found us a case.

07:47.797 --> 07:49.497
More Michael monsters?

07:49.499 --> 07:52.033
No.

07:52.035 --> 07:53.234
Killer toy.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.473
What kind of toy?

08:00.477 --> 08:02.544
<i>And then the thing</i>
<i>freakin' jumped me!</i>

08:02.546 --> 08:04.879
<i>I mean, It wouldn't stop!</i>
<i>It was just over and over.</i>

08:04.881 --> 08:06.648
<i>Just...</i>

08:09.119 --> 08:11.953
<i>Panthro kicked my ass.</i>

08:11.955 --> 08:13.454
ThunderCats?

08:13.456 --> 08:14.589
Seriously?

08:14.591 --> 08:16.224
Yeah.

08:16.226 --> 08:17.825
But, I mean,
you got your pizza,

08:17.827 --> 08:19.527
at least eight more
of these movies,

08:19.529 --> 08:20.962
so I'll just
leave you to it,

08:20.964 --> 08:22.130
and I'll get one
of the other guys to --

08:22.132 --> 08:23.364
Oh, hell no.

08:23.366 --> 08:24.966
Hell no.

08:24.968 --> 08:26.568
No.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.304
Panthro is mine.

08:39.316 --> 08:40.847
I wonder if we're talking,
like, one toy gone bad

08:40.850 --> 08:42.183
or if it's like
a whole crew,

08:42.184 --> 08:43.818
you know,
like Puppet Master-style.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.221
Do you actually want there
to be more than one?

08:46.223 --> 08:48.723
I don't know,
just...

08:48.725 --> 08:49.691
- Boo!
- Boo!

08:49.693 --> 08:51.159
Aah.

08:51.161 --> 08:52.360
Still not a fan
of Halloween, huh?

08:52.362 --> 08:53.361
Nope.

08:53.363 --> 08:55.096
So lame.

08:55.098 --> 08:58.533
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

08:58.535 --> 09:01.002
Hey, I can help you guys
in just a second.

09:04.407 --> 09:08.042
Hm, she's like
your twin.

09:08.044 --> 09:09.544
What? What are you
talking about?

09:09.546 --> 09:13.248
Her -- soft, delicate features,
luxurious hair.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.216
She's like
your Wonder Twin.

09:15.218 --> 09:17.485
Yeah.

09:20.423 --> 09:21.689
All right, okay.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.958
Well, if that's me,
then, uh...

09:23.960 --> 09:27.962
that's you over there.

09:27.964 --> 09:29.430
- That guy?
- Yeah.

09:29.432 --> 09:34.035
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we have zero in common.

09:36.473 --> 09:38.406
Hatchet Man.

09:38.408 --> 09:39.707
No way. Sam.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.409
Check it out.
It's David freakin' Yaeger.

09:41.411 --> 09:42.277
Yeah.

09:42.279 --> 09:44.379
Press the button.

09:44.381 --> 09:45.313
Hm?

09:50.086 --> 09:52.086
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

09:52.088 --> 09:54.322
Oh, dude.

09:54.324 --> 09:58.159
<i>We all do bad things sometimes.</i>

09:58.161 --> 09:59.927
<i>Trick or Treat!</i>

09:59.929 --> 10:02.330
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Dude.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.565
- I need this.
- How much?

10:04.567 --> 10:06.734
Not for sale.

10:06.736 --> 10:07.869
Hatchet Man's a classic.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.340
Yeah.
Nothing in common.

10:12.342 --> 10:14.909
Okay, what can
I help you guys with?

10:14.911 --> 10:16.944
Funko Pops,
Magic cards...?

10:16.946 --> 10:20.248
Uh, Stuart Blake --
Vintage Hot Wheels.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.482
I'm sorry.

10:21.484 --> 10:23.818
Uh, were you getting
helped by Stuart

10:23.820 --> 10:24.952
with vintage Hot Wheels,
or...

10:24.954 --> 10:26.354
No, sorry.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.690
Um, my name is Ian Gillan,
and this is...

10:28.692 --> 10:30.358
I'm Ritchie Blackmore.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.427
We're with Campbell & Sons
Insurance.

10:32.429 --> 10:34.662
We heard about Stuart's
little incident with the toy,

10:34.664 --> 10:36.798
and, uh, we're hoping
to speak to him.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.433
Well, he's at home
healing up.

10:38.435 --> 10:39.834
Well, we went
to his place,

10:39.836 --> 10:41.336
and his roommate said
he had moved out.

10:41.338 --> 10:42.837
Kicked out, actually.

10:42.839 --> 10:45.673
Right.
They had a fight.

10:45.675 --> 10:47.675
Over...?

10:47.677 --> 10:49.844
"Fist of
the North Star."

10:49.846 --> 10:52.046
Stuart said that
the dubbed version was better,

10:52.048 --> 10:54.048
but --
You know what, forget it.

10:54.050 --> 10:58.486
Um, I like Stuart,
but he's an acquired taste.

10:58.488 --> 11:00.855
Sounds like a guy
who could make a lot of enemies.

11:00.857 --> 11:03.191
I mean, not real ones.

11:03.193 --> 11:07.061
Maybe online --
He trolls everything.

11:07.063 --> 11:09.797
Okay, uh...
where can we find Stuart now?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.532
He's at his mom's house.

11:11.534 --> 11:14.001
Of course he is.

11:14.003 --> 11:16.471
Thanks.

11:19.142 --> 11:21.676
Stewie will be up
in just a minute.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.111
Thanks.

11:26.149 --> 11:28.716
I can't believe you had her
make us apple cider.

11:28.718 --> 11:30.084
She offered.

11:30.086 --> 11:33.020
No! No!
You stupid, dumb --

11:33.022 --> 11:35.556
That's not how you play
the...

11:35.558 --> 11:39.060
Game over!
I'm done! Done!

11:42.599 --> 11:44.031
Who are you?

11:44.033 --> 11:46.067
Uh, we're from
Campbell & Sons Insurance,

11:46.069 --> 11:48.436
and --
- What are you doing down there?

11:48.438 --> 11:50.738
Fortnite.

11:50.740 --> 11:52.340
Hm.

11:52.342 --> 11:54.175
It's a video game.

11:54.177 --> 11:57.578
It's <i>the</i> video game.

11:57.580 --> 11:59.547
Yeah, well,
I'm a Zelda for life, so...

12:02.786 --> 12:05.420
What, are you burning sage
down there?

12:05.422 --> 12:07.121
So...?

12:07.123 --> 12:10.892
I-I dated this goth chick.
Like, super hot.

12:10.894 --> 12:13.561
Met online, and --
and she was into Wicca.

12:13.563 --> 12:16.197
Said that burning sage
was, like, good luck

12:16.199 --> 12:17.732
or some crap like that.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.100
Hmm.

12:19.102 --> 12:21.068
So, you're not together
anymore?

12:21.070 --> 12:22.403
No.

12:22.405 --> 12:24.238
I broke it off
before we could MIRL.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.375
You know, I mean, who needs
goth-girl drama, am I right?

12:27.377 --> 12:29.644
- Merle?
- Uh, M-I-R-L.

12:29.646 --> 12:31.112
"Meet in real life."

12:31.114 --> 12:32.447
Why do you know
what that means?

12:33.550 --> 12:35.483
Stuart, we're here
to ask about the attack

12:35.485 --> 12:36.751
you reported
with the toy --

12:36.753 --> 12:38.252
I made it up.

12:38.254 --> 12:39.921
You what?

12:39.923 --> 12:42.623
The whole thing.
I lied.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.125
But the video...

12:44.127 --> 12:46.794
That was fake.

12:46.796 --> 12:50.331
I didn't expect it to go viral,
but it did,

12:50.333 --> 12:53.134
and, uh...I just...

12:53.136 --> 12:55.136
I fell.

12:55.138 --> 12:56.671
Hm.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.639
'Cause the hospital report said
that you had marks

12:58.641 --> 13:00.975
on your face, your legs,
your back,

13:00.977 --> 13:02.443
and your...
genitals.

13:02.445 --> 13:03.911
That's not a slip
and fall.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.179
Well, I don't see why
an insurance company

13:05.181 --> 13:06.681
would care, you know?

13:06.683 --> 13:08.616
And I-I think it's time
for you to leave.

13:08.618 --> 13:10.017
- Okay, but --
- Now.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.754
Wow.

13:13.756 --> 13:16.290
Lady-you wasn't kidding.
That guy's a piece of work.

13:16.292 --> 13:18.693
Well, whatever happened
was not an accident.

13:18.695 --> 13:20.328
Okay, but, uh...
Big Bang in there,

13:20.330 --> 13:21.529
not a great liar.

13:21.531 --> 13:22.830
No.

13:22.832 --> 13:24.632
So, what are we thinking?
Spell?

13:24.634 --> 13:26.300
Well, his girlfriend
was into Wicca.

13:26.302 --> 13:27.635
Wicca doesn't always
mean witch.

13:27.637 --> 13:29.437
Except when it does.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.472
All right, let's wait
till they leave,

13:31.474 --> 13:33.274
check out the house
for hex bags.

13:33.276 --> 13:35.042
Deal.

13:35.044 --> 13:38.946
Yeah, find some
lamb's blood.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.982
Right, exactly.

13:40.984 --> 13:42.049
All right, good.

13:42.051 --> 13:43.951
Stay safe.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.820
All good?

13:45.822 --> 13:48.723
Yeah, it was Riley.
He'll be fine.

13:48.725 --> 13:50.625
I don't know who Riley is,
but cool.

13:50.627 --> 13:54.562
Happy Halloween!

13:54.564 --> 13:56.564
So, seriously, what is your deal
with Halloween?

13:56.566 --> 13:59.300
I don't like it.

13:59.302 --> 14:01.402
Yeah, but why don't
you like it? Hmm?

14:01.404 --> 14:03.004
And don't give me
that, like,

14:03.006 --> 14:06.040
"Oh, every day is Halloween
for us" crap, okay?

14:06.042 --> 14:08.175
Because, one,
it ain't.

14:08.177 --> 14:09.477
We don't eat
that much candy.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.179
Two, you've had this hate on
for years.

14:12.181 --> 14:15.049
So...?

14:15.051 --> 14:16.417
Mom's on the move.

14:40.243 --> 14:43.344
All right,
what about our guy?

14:45.214 --> 14:47.882
You know, I think I know
why Stuart changed his story.

14:47.884 --> 14:50.284
Uh, the comments on his video
are all pretty brutal.

14:50.286 --> 14:55.356
People are calling him a liar,
a loser, "ThunderSpaz,"

14:55.358 --> 14:59.193
Snarf's love child,
Panthro's bi...

14:59.195 --> 15:01.562
- Rhymes with "itch"?
- Yep.

15:01.564 --> 15:04.632
Got to love the Internet,
where everyone can be a dick.

15:06.302 --> 15:08.102
Help me!

15:08.104 --> 15:10.638
Help me! Help!

15:18.081 --> 15:19.313
Stay with him.

15:19.315 --> 15:21.248
Okay, uh...

15:21.250 --> 15:24.118
Hang in there. Hey, wait.
We'll get you help.

16:29.672 --> 16:31.171
My poor baby.

16:31.173 --> 16:32.839
Yeah, it was touch and go
there for a while,

16:32.841 --> 16:35.242
but, uh, doctors say
he's gonna be all right.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.478
I'm just grateful
you showed up.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.880
I...

16:41.684 --> 16:43.216
Thank you.

16:43.218 --> 16:46.053
You saved his life.

16:46.055 --> 16:48.322
Oh, I-I should
run back home,

16:48.324 --> 16:50.691
get -- get Stewie
his favorite pillow.

16:50.693 --> 16:52.392
Actually,
you know what? Um...

16:52.394 --> 16:54.528
It's probably better
if you just stay here.

16:54.530 --> 16:57.597
Yeah, just until he wakes up,
you know?

16:57.599 --> 17:00.767
Yeah, of course.
You're -- You're right.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.736
I'm just all flustered.

17:02.738 --> 17:05.105
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.040
Everything is <i>not</i> fine.

17:08.042 --> 17:09.710
Yeah. My first clue was
the flying chainsaw.

17:09.712 --> 17:11.211
While you were waiting
for the ambulance,

17:11.213 --> 17:12.713
I did a quick sweep
for hex bags, nothing,

17:12.714 --> 17:15.281
but then I pulled out EMF,
went freakin' crazy.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.351
- So it's a ghost.
- Yeah.

17:17.353 --> 17:18.785
Hey, we got to
figure out a way

17:18.787 --> 17:20.119
to keep mom here
while we clear the house.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.722
You know, I don't get
why a ghost would be

17:21.723 --> 17:22.955
gunning for Stuart.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.758
Murder,
grave robbery,

17:24.760 --> 17:26.193
stole his favorite
Pokémon --

17:26.194 --> 17:27.294
I mean, take your pick.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.528
Yeah.

17:28.530 --> 17:29.763
All right,
you stay here with them.

17:29.765 --> 17:31.298
I'll go check the house,
ask around,

17:31.300 --> 17:32.866
see if anybody --
- Got dead lately?

17:32.868 --> 17:35.402
- Yeah.
- All right.

17:35.404 --> 17:38.105
<i>GI Lab, 6-2-6-7.</i>

18:21.016 --> 18:22.849
Nice, Sam.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.184
Smooth.

18:33.629 --> 18:35.328
What the hell?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.815
<i>Now back</i>
<i>to our feature.</i>

18:54.817 --> 18:56.683
<i>Viewer discretion is advised.</i>

18:56.685 --> 18:58.518
<i>Are you insane?!</i>

18:58.520 --> 19:00.554
<i>They will never understand</i>
<i>that it was an accident.</i>

19:00.556 --> 19:02.622
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:02.624 --> 19:03.824
What are you
doing here?

19:03.826 --> 19:05.859
Just keeping an eye
on Stuart.

19:05.861 --> 19:08.995
He must have
awesome insurance.

19:08.997 --> 19:10.664
Super-awesome.

19:10.666 --> 19:11.898
Yeah.

19:14.002 --> 19:15.202
Trick or treat?

19:19.208 --> 19:20.807
He's still out.

19:20.809 --> 19:22.409
Yeah, the nurse told me.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.077
Babs went out for
a quick bite.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.246
Figured
I'd stick around.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.515
I want to be here
when he wakes up.

19:28.517 --> 19:30.750
He's kind of
my best friend.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.653
Is that right?

19:33.655 --> 19:36.423
Look, I...

19:36.425 --> 19:41.061
I know Stuart has his stuff,
but we all do.

19:41.063 --> 19:43.663
And me and my dad don't
get along so great,

19:43.665 --> 19:47.033
and whenever we --
we really have it out,

19:47.035 --> 19:49.903
Stuart lets me
crash at his place.

19:49.905 --> 19:51.538
No questions asked.

19:51.540 --> 19:55.575
We just eat pizza
and watch movies.

19:55.577 --> 19:57.210
It's...

19:57.212 --> 20:00.347
Zen.

20:00.349 --> 20:02.215
Sounds like
a good friend.

20:02.217 --> 20:04.885
Yeah, but now,
when his mom called,

20:04.887 --> 20:08.288
said someone a-attacked him
with a chainsaw?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.290
Looks like.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.592
Happy Halloween, huh?

20:21.537 --> 20:23.403
<i>Oh, I got to get</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

20:23.405 --> 20:25.939
Cool.
"All Saints' Day Three."

20:25.941 --> 20:27.741
<i>Totally...</i>

20:27.743 --> 20:30.610
Time to
slice and dice!

20:30.612 --> 20:35.815
<i>Like,</i>
<i>creeping me out to the max.</i>

20:37.085 --> 20:38.985
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

20:38.987 --> 20:42.656
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:44.724
Never gets old.

20:44.726 --> 20:45.959
You know, a lot of people
don't like this one,

20:45.961 --> 20:47.727
but it's actually
my favorite.

20:47.729 --> 20:49.496
I mean, sure.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.331
There's no way a hospital would
ever be <i>that</i> empty.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.500
but that's over-thinking it.
- I don't know.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.968
I've been to a lot of hospitals
at night.

20:54.970 --> 20:56.636
Trust me,
they get pretty empty.

20:56.638 --> 20:58.438
Okay, so,
"All Saints' Day Three" --

20:58.440 --> 21:00.106
That's my top pick.
What about you?

21:00.108 --> 21:03.843
I mean, I like Five,
right --

21:03.845 --> 21:05.412
"Search for
David Yaeger"?

21:05.414 --> 21:06.780
'Cause it's weird,
but it's bloody.

21:06.782 --> 21:07.681
- So bloody.
- Yeah.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.815
In the best way.

21:08.817 --> 21:11.084
But, uh...

21:11.086 --> 21:12.686
I got to go
with number four.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.920
- "Hatchet Man Lives"?
- Yeah.

21:13.922 --> 21:16.456
Nice choice.

21:16.458 --> 21:19.492
"Killed in a prank
gone wrong..."

21:19.494 --> 21:23.363
"Mechanic David Yaeger
comes back every year

21:23.365 --> 21:25.865
on the day after Halloween.

21:25.867 --> 21:29.703
On All Saints' Day,
Hatchet Man takes his revenge!"

21:31.673 --> 21:32.872
You really know
your A.S.D.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.374
Yeah, well...

21:34.376 --> 21:36.676
growing up,
it was, uh...

21:36.678 --> 21:39.446
It was always nice to check out
once in a while.

21:39.448 --> 21:41.815
I like to watch movies

21:41.817 --> 21:43.950
where I know
the bad guy's gonna lose.

21:45.621 --> 21:47.120
<i>Knock knock.</i>

21:47.122 --> 21:49.422
<i>Time to die.</i>

21:54.963 --> 21:56.896
Oh, um, we're, um --
we're closing.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.531
Yeah, right. I-I just, uh...

21:58.533 --> 22:00.367
Sorry.
I'm just here to, um...

22:00.369 --> 22:03.036
Did you hear
about Stuart?

22:03.038 --> 22:04.971
Yeah, his mom
told us what happened

22:04.973 --> 22:06.473
when she dropped off his keys.
- Yeah.

22:06.475 --> 22:08.341
I mean, what happened to him,
that's insane.

22:08.343 --> 22:11.344
Yeah, yeah, so -- so I actually
have a few questions, um...

22:11.346 --> 22:13.513
and they might be
a little different.

22:13.515 --> 22:16.716
- Different like...
- Different like, uh...

22:16.718 --> 22:20.887
Has anyone close to Stuart
died recently?

22:20.889 --> 22:22.756
You're an insurance dude,
right?

22:22.758 --> 22:24.924
Yeah, yeah, and --
and we wouldn't normally

22:24.926 --> 22:26.259
ask these kinds of questions,

22:26.261 --> 22:28.194
but it's a special
circumstance, and...

22:28.196 --> 22:30.530
Well, I mean...

22:30.532 --> 22:32.332
Jordan.

22:32.334 --> 22:33.533
Jordan?

22:33.535 --> 22:35.669
Yeah, he owned the store.

22:35.671 --> 22:37.604
He taught Stuart,
Dirk, and I

22:37.606 --> 22:40.073
everything we know
about comics and games.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.776
He was like our own personal
Willy Wonka.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.110
Huh.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.546
Sounds like a great guy.

22:46.548 --> 22:49.249
He was.

22:49.251 --> 22:50.850
Cancer sucks, you know?

22:50.852 --> 22:52.886
Yeah.

22:52.888 --> 22:56.189
So, who owns
the place now?

22:56.191 --> 22:58.124
Me and Dirk.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.392
Jordan left it to us.

22:59.394 --> 23:01.795
But not Stuart?

23:01.797 --> 23:05.265
Stuart worked here,
but Jordan fired him twice.

23:05.267 --> 23:06.800
He kept catching
Stuart stealing,

23:06.802 --> 23:08.034
and to Jordan,

23:08.036 --> 23:10.070
this place was his life,
you know?

23:10.072 --> 23:12.605
And you hired
Stuart back?

23:12.607 --> 23:14.808
He's my friend.

23:16.745 --> 23:18.712
Right.

23:18.714 --> 23:21.081
Okay, uh...
Where is Jordan buried?

23:21.083 --> 23:23.616
Nowhere.
He was cremated.

23:26.788 --> 23:28.588
Oh, um, right.

23:28.590 --> 23:31.791
Sure, uh, excuse me.
I just have to, uh...

23:31.793 --> 23:33.426
What's that?

23:35.931 --> 23:37.263
Nothing.

23:37.265 --> 23:41.267
It's a, um...
carbon monoxide detector.

23:41.269 --> 23:43.570
Wh-- Is that --
Is that bad?

23:43.572 --> 23:45.772
Yeah, yep.

23:45.774 --> 23:47.941
Pretty bad.
Um...

23:47.943 --> 23:50.310
You know what?
Uh, you should leave now.

23:50.459 --> 23:51.868
- What? No.
- Okay, listen to me.

23:51.878 --> 23:53.844
This is weird,
but I think you're in danger --

24:12.950 --> 24:14.617
Samantha?

24:18.155 --> 24:19.822
Samantha!

24:23.794 --> 24:24.927
Hey!

24:24.929 --> 24:27.496
Hey, are you okay?

24:27.498 --> 24:28.631
No?

24:28.633 --> 24:30.332
What just happened?

24:30.334 --> 24:31.634
I think, uh...

24:31.636 --> 24:33.202
I think a ghost --

24:33.204 --> 24:34.470
A ghost?

24:34.472 --> 24:36.605
Yes, um... All right.
Listen to me.

24:36.607 --> 24:39.608
Ghosts are real,
and they can possess things --

24:39.610 --> 24:41.777
uh, people,
toys, chainsaws,

24:41.779 --> 24:43.279
and, apparently,
life-size figurines.

24:43.281 --> 24:45.981
You are not from
an insurance company, are you?

24:45.983 --> 24:48.183
N-Not exactly.

24:48.185 --> 24:50.286
Listen,
I-I-I'm not sure,

24:50.288 --> 24:53.222
but I think the ghost of Jordan
is trying to kill Stuart.

24:53.224 --> 24:54.523
Wait, what?

24:54.525 --> 24:55.991
Did he hurt you?

24:55.993 --> 24:57.493
No, he just --

24:57.495 --> 25:00.396
He shoved me out of the way,
and then he bolted.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.031
It's locked.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.366
Where are the keys?

25:04.368 --> 25:06.068
Hatchet Man or whatever
took them.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.403
- You sure?
-I --

25:07.405 --> 25:09.238
I was pretty busy
screaming,

25:09.240 --> 25:11.173
but, yeah, I'm sure.

25:11.175 --> 25:12.541
Is this expensive?

25:12.543 --> 25:13.742
What?

25:13.744 --> 25:15.311
- No, don't!
- Eugh!

25:17.248 --> 25:19.048
Yeah,
it's shatter-proof glass.

25:19.050 --> 25:23.085
Jordan's pretty serious
about thieves.

25:26.023 --> 25:29.091
The aerobics instructor
in the giant mixer.

25:29.093 --> 25:30.593
Right, and then the kids
the next morning are

25:30.595 --> 25:32.094
at the rec center,
they're all eating breakfast,

25:32.096 --> 25:33.929
and the one finds a tooth
with all the stringy bits

25:33.931 --> 25:34.830
still hooked onto it.

25:34.832 --> 25:35.998
Oh, come on.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.333
I mean,
forget Freddy and Jason.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.168
That's top-10 horror-movie kill
right there.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.569
Top-five, even.

25:40.571 --> 25:42.538
Oh, and then,
the jock guy's face

25:42.540 --> 25:44.607
when Hatchet Man shoves it into
the engine fan of that truck

25:44.609 --> 25:46.875
and it just, like...
bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl-bbl...

25:49.080 --> 25:51.714
Did you know that
they made the brain splatter

25:51.716 --> 25:53.415
with saltwater taffy?

25:53.417 --> 25:54.883
I did not know that.
Yeah.

25:54.885 --> 25:57.920
That's pretty cool.

25:57.922 --> 26:00.089
Excuse me.

26:02.693 --> 26:03.926
Yeah, what's up, Sam?

26:03.928 --> 26:05.461
We were right.
It's a ghost.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.062
Guy's name was
Jordan MacNeel.

26:07.064 --> 26:08.430
He used to own
the comic shop.

26:08.432 --> 26:10.265
All right, so we going
to a graveyard or what?

26:10.267 --> 26:12.067
No, no, no.
He was cremated.

26:12.069 --> 26:13.736
And, um...

26:13.738 --> 26:15.471
And what?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.040
So, he possessed the
David Yaeger figure at the shop,

26:18.042 --> 26:19.541
<i>and I think he's coming</i>
<i>for Stuart.</i>

26:19.543 --> 26:21.110
Wait, wait, wait --
Are you telling me that --

26:21.112 --> 26:24.246
that Hatchet Man David Yaeger
is coming here?

26:24.248 --> 26:26.315
<i>Uh, I mean, not --</i>
<i>not literally, but...</i>

26:26.317 --> 26:30.753
Hatchet Man is
coming here?

26:32.423 --> 26:35.758
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

26:48.406 --> 26:50.072
Hey, hey.
Look at that.

26:50.074 --> 26:52.508
Hey, man!

26:52.510 --> 26:54.143
Whoo!

26:54.145 --> 26:56.845
David Yaeger!

26:56.847 --> 26:58.847
Killer costume!

26:58.849 --> 27:03.852
Come on, let's go.
Hey, trick or treat!

27:05.856 --> 27:07.423
If ghosts are real,
does that mean vampires?

27:07.425 --> 27:08.290
Yep.

27:08.292 --> 27:09.692
- Witches?
- Uh-huh.

27:09.694 --> 27:11.026
Werewolves?

27:11.028 --> 27:13.829
Unless it's Godzilla,
it's real.

27:13.831 --> 27:15.197
All right.
Get in.

27:15.199 --> 27:16.799
But --
Now!

27:16.801 --> 27:18.100
Now, listen to me.

27:18.102 --> 27:19.535
Ghosts can't cross
the salt line, okay?

27:19.537 --> 27:20.869
So whatever you hear,
whatever you see,

27:20.871 --> 27:23.472
whatever happens,
stay inside.

27:23.474 --> 27:25.541
Capiche?

27:29.680 --> 27:31.780
What I don't get is,

27:31.782 --> 27:34.616
why is Jordan going
after Stuart now?

27:34.618 --> 27:36.552
It doesn't make
any sense.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.721
Stuart's been
stealing.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.723
- What?
- I mean, not cash,

27:40.725 --> 27:42.558
just stuff that
he thought was cool.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.493
And Stuart doesn't have
good impulse control.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.994
I've been taking money
out of his checks

27:45.996 --> 27:47.529
to make up for it,
but I guess...

27:47.531 --> 27:49.465
a ghost wouldn't
know that.

27:49.467 --> 27:50.699
Yeah, guess not.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.235
Oh, come on.

27:53.237 --> 27:54.636
Damn it.

27:54.638 --> 27:56.171
Yeah.
It's a hardcore lock.

27:56.173 --> 27:57.506
All right.
We got to get out of here.

27:57.508 --> 28:00.342
Okay, how?

28:00.344 --> 28:01.810
Do you have
cleaning supplies?

28:12.923 --> 28:16.058
What the...

28:18.095 --> 28:20.095
Aaah!

28:27.238 --> 28:29.204
Help!

28:29.206 --> 28:31.206
What's happening?

28:31.208 --> 28:33.275
I got to get
out of here!

28:58.435 --> 29:00.035
Hey!

29:00.037 --> 29:02.271
Jordan, I --

29:02.273 --> 29:04.439
I know you're trying
to kill Stuart,

29:04.441 --> 29:06.275
but he's <i>my</i> friend.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.777
He's <i>our</i> friend.

29:08.779 --> 29:10.946
So if you want
to do this,

29:10.948 --> 29:12.414
you're gonna have
to go through me!

29:20.057 --> 29:22.825
Oh, crap.

29:22.827 --> 29:26.795
<i>Hey, Phil.</i>
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

29:26.797 --> 29:29.331
<i>Come on.</i>

29:36.173 --> 29:37.105
Oh, no.

29:37.107 --> 29:38.440
Run. Run, girl.

29:40.077 --> 29:42.911
<i>I like it when they run.</i>

29:42.913 --> 29:44.279
Now, you see that?
You see that?

29:44.281 --> 29:46.148
That's...
my favorite part.

29:50.821 --> 29:54.189
<i>Stop!</i>
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

29:55.826 --> 29:59.027
<i>Enough talking.</i>
<i>More killing.</i>

29:59.029 --> 30:00.762
You kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

30:00.764 --> 30:01.930
Ooh.
Right?

30:01.932 --> 30:04.333
- She is so slow.
- Come on, man.

30:04.335 --> 30:06.335
<i>Somebody come</i>
<i>and help me please!</i>

30:08.539 --> 30:11.273
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

30:11.275 --> 30:13.108
Ooh!
Run, girl! Run!

30:13.110 --> 30:15.310
Mm!

30:15.312 --> 30:17.312
You got to run, girl.
Come on, man.

30:17.314 --> 30:18.814
My grandmother runs
faster than you.

30:18.816 --> 30:20.649
Help! Somebody!

30:20.651 --> 30:22.851
Anybody help me!

30:27.224 --> 30:28.557
Where is everybody?!

30:33.898 --> 30:35.063
Oh, God.

30:35.065 --> 30:38.667
Oh, God.
Jordan, please!

30:38.669 --> 30:42.304
You're dead!

30:42.306 --> 30:43.972
<i>Get away from me!</i>

30:43.974 --> 30:45.540
<i>We killed you.</i>
<i>You're dead!</i>

30:45.542 --> 30:49.544
<i>We all do bad things</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>

30:49.546 --> 30:51.046
Press that button.
Press that button.

30:51.048 --> 30:53.215
He would never catch me,
tell you that much.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.086
<i>No, this can't</i>
<i>be happening.</i>

30:59.857 --> 31:01.823
No. No!

31:01.825 --> 31:05.427
<i>You can't run</i>
<i>from Hatchet Man.</i>

31:05.429 --> 31:08.030
<i>This isn't...</i>
...real!

31:14.104 --> 31:15.537
All right.

31:15.539 --> 31:17.506
Pretty sure
this will work.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.508
Where did you learn
how to do this?

31:19.510 --> 31:22.444
I had a messed-up
childhood.

31:22.446 --> 31:24.112
Okay.

31:24.114 --> 31:26.882
Here goes.

31:26.884 --> 31:29.751
Yep, all right.
Uh, get back.

31:38.195 --> 31:39.628
Get down.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.972
- Cool.           - Cool.

32:04.054 --> 32:06.054
Told you to stay put.

32:06.056 --> 32:08.623
You don't --
He's here.

32:08.625 --> 32:09.958
Where?

32:12.796 --> 32:15.297
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

32:15.299 --> 32:18.200
Oh, hell.

32:26.610 --> 32:30.612
<i>David Yaeger was an honest man</i>
<i>making an honest living,</i>

32:30.614 --> 32:34.149
<i>until one night,</i>
<i>when a practical joke...</i>

32:34.151 --> 32:36.952
<i>turned deadly.</i>

32:36.954 --> 32:39.287
One day,
we're gonna have to answer

32:39.289 --> 32:41.356
for the things
we did that night.

32:41.358 --> 32:44.359
It was just a prank.

32:46.964 --> 32:50.932
<i>Now, David Yaeger is back</i>
<i>with his faithful hatchet</i>

32:50.934 --> 32:54.336
<i>to get revenge on those</i>
<i>who took his life.</i>

32:56.640 --> 32:58.940
<i>If the people responsible</i>
<i>for his death</i>

32:58.942 --> 33:00.876
<i>weren't torn up about it...</i>

33:00.878 --> 33:01.943
<i>they're going to be.</i>

33:03.347 --> 33:05.814
Time to slice
and dice.

33:05.816 --> 33:08.316
<i>In this dark, quiet hospital,</i>

33:08.318 --> 33:11.153
<i>they can run, they can hide...</i>

33:11.155 --> 33:12.954
We killed you.
You're dead!

33:12.956 --> 33:15.624
<i>...but there's no escaping</i>
<i>the Hatchet Man.</i>

33:15.626 --> 33:17.059
Trick or treat.

33:17.061 --> 33:19.861
No, this can't
be happening.

33:19.863 --> 33:23.632
We all do bad things

33:23.634 --> 33:26.701
<i>"All Saints' Day III:</i>
<i>The Reckoning,"</i>

33:26.703 --> 33:28.737
<i>coming soon</i>

33:28.739 --> 33:30.338
<i>Pray for survival.</i>

33:34.009 --> 33:35.675
All right, look, man.

33:35.677 --> 33:38.178
I know once you go Casper,
things can be a little --

33:38.180 --> 33:39.946
well, a lot crazy.

33:39.948 --> 33:42.482
The way I see it,
you got two options.

33:42.484 --> 33:45.785
One, you let this go,
and you walk into the light.

33:45.787 --> 33:47.754
Or, two...

33:47.756 --> 33:49.088
I send you there.

33:52.093 --> 33:55.261
<i>Time to slice and dice.</i>

33:55.263 --> 33:57.096
I was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

34:08.677 --> 34:10.009
Stay back!
I got this.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.523
Problem is, the ghost is always
tied to an object.

34:23.525 --> 34:25.558
Right? Its bones, something
that meant a lot to it in life.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.293
Whatever that thing is,
the ghost is usually

34:27.295 --> 34:28.828
stuck there, but Jordan,
he's been all over --

34:28.830 --> 34:30.295
the shop, Stuart's house,

34:30.297 --> 34:32.130
so how's he moving around?
- The key chain.

34:32.132 --> 34:33.800
- What?
- It was Jordan's

34:33.802 --> 34:35.534
and then Stuart closed up
the night he got attacked

34:35.536 --> 34:37.070
and he brought
the shop keys home

34:37.072 --> 34:38.571
and then his mom
brought them back after.

34:38.572 --> 34:41.206
I mean, could that --
Does that make sense?

34:42.744 --> 34:44.476
Yeah.
It does.

34:44.478 --> 34:45.844
Come on.

34:54.022 --> 34:58.191
<i>We all do bad things sometimes.</i>

35:07.102 --> 35:08.501
I --

35:08.503 --> 35:09.536
Sorry?

35:22.417 --> 35:23.783
Dean! Key chain!

35:35.096 --> 35:37.263
Come on,
come on, come on.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.798
Here. Here.
Use this.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.701
Ugh!
It's really sunk in deep!

35:41.703 --> 35:43.036
Hurry up!

36:07.462 --> 36:11.230
<i>Time to slice</i>
<i>and di...</i>

36:21.367 --> 36:24.134
Is it really over?
Just like that?

36:24.674 --> 36:26.932
"Just like that"?

36:26.933 --> 36:28.266
Yeah, you're --

36:28.268 --> 36:30.201
You're all safe now,
even Stuart.

36:32.305 --> 36:35.039
And Jordan,
is -- is he...

36:35.041 --> 36:36.674
He's in a better place.

36:53.293 --> 36:54.325
Thanks, man.

36:54.327 --> 36:57.495
Hmm?

36:57.497 --> 36:58.863
You, uh...
You got me out here

36:58.865 --> 37:00.832
'cause you needed
to get me out of my funk

37:00.834 --> 37:03.634
and get me a win,
and you did.

37:03.636 --> 37:05.570
So...

37:05.572 --> 37:07.038
thanks.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.906
I got to admit,

37:08.908 --> 37:10.559
it didn't go exactly like
I thought it would.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.710
Hey, man. I just went toe-to-toe
with David freakin' Yaeger.

37:12.712 --> 37:14.245
That was awesome.

37:14.247 --> 37:16.480
Yeah, it wasn't really --
Don't ruin this for me.

37:20.086 --> 37:23.888
Hey, Dean...

37:23.890 --> 37:26.224
when we get back
to the bunker, man,

37:26.226 --> 37:28.159
you got to stop hiding out
in your room.

37:28.161 --> 37:29.327
I'm not hiding out.

37:29.329 --> 37:30.394
And I get why
you're doing it.

37:30.396 --> 37:32.597
I-I do.

37:32.599 --> 37:34.765
But...

37:34.767 --> 37:38.102
what happened
with Michael...

37:38.104 --> 37:41.873
You said yes for me, for Jack,
for your family.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.074
You did the right thing.

37:43.076 --> 37:44.375
What happened after,

37:44.377 --> 37:46.010
just because Michael
was wearing your face,

37:46.012 --> 37:48.279
doesn't mean
any of this is on you.

37:48.281 --> 37:50.748
I don't blame you.
No one blames you.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.184
You got to try and stop
blaming yourself,

37:53.186 --> 37:54.919
please.

37:54.921 --> 37:57.054
I'm never gonna get
over it, okay?

37:57.056 --> 37:59.223
I'm just not.

37:59.225 --> 38:02.059
But you're right --

38:02.061 --> 38:03.427
I'm not doing
anybody any good

38:03.429 --> 38:04.762
by just staying couped up
in my room,

38:04.764 --> 38:11.235
so...whatever you need,
I'm there.

38:11.237 --> 38:13.938
All right, <i>chief?</i>

38:17.543 --> 38:18.809
All right.
Well, that is it.

38:18.811 --> 38:20.611
Halloween is
officially over.

38:20.613 --> 38:22.046
Good.

38:22.048 --> 38:23.648
Okay, seriously, why?

38:23.650 --> 38:25.950
Why do you hate Halloween?
What is it?

38:25.952 --> 38:28.085
Was it the time that I --
I ate all your Halloween candy?

38:28.087 --> 38:29.553
- No.
- Was it something Dad did?

38:29.555 --> 38:31.455
No, dude, you don't
want to know.

38:31.457 --> 38:34.525
No, I really do.
Really.

38:37.063 --> 38:38.562
What?

38:39.599 --> 38:41.899
All right.

38:41.901 --> 38:43.501
Remember Andrea Howell?

38:46.406 --> 38:47.905
No.

38:47.907 --> 38:50.474
When I was in sixth grade,
we were living in Bismark.

38:50.476 --> 38:51.909
I had a huge crush on her.

38:51.911 --> 38:53.577
Aww, that's adorable.

38:53.579 --> 38:54.946
Continue.

38:54.948 --> 38:57.982
So, she invited me
to her Halloween party.

38:57.984 --> 38:59.350
I said yes,
and I-I went over,

38:59.352 --> 39:05.156
and at first, everything
was great, um...

39:05.158 --> 39:07.291
And then we started
to play games.

39:07.293 --> 39:08.859
Spin the bottle?

39:08.861 --> 39:11.295
B-Bobbing for apples.

39:14.701 --> 39:17.201
Like I said,
I had a crush,

39:17.203 --> 39:21.172
so the entire night,
my stomach was in knots,

39:21.174 --> 39:25.176
and when it was my turn,
I-I bent down, and...

39:25.178 --> 39:26.510
No.

39:26.512 --> 39:28.612
...hurled.

39:28.614 --> 39:30.214
Everywhere.

39:30.216 --> 39:32.950
Lunch, dinner,
it all came up --

39:32.952 --> 39:34.986
on Andrea, mostly.

39:34.988 --> 39:37.655
Uh, people
ran and screamed,

39:37.657 --> 39:41.459
and it was <i>so</i> bad.

39:41.461 --> 39:43.160
That's great.

39:43.162 --> 39:45.730
I ended up hiding out
in the woods

39:45.732 --> 39:47.565
until you finally
came and got me.

39:47.567 --> 39:50.134
So that's why
you hate Halloween.

39:50.136 --> 39:51.836
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, man.

39:51.838 --> 39:53.504
You got to get over that.
That's -- I mean...

39:53.506 --> 39:54.972
All right.
This is what we're gonna do.

39:54.974 --> 39:58.242
Next year, we're doing Halloween
right, okay?

39:58.244 --> 40:01.579
I'm thinking matching outfits
like, uh...

40:01.581 --> 40:03.080
Batman and Robin.

40:03.082 --> 40:04.882
No.

40:04.884 --> 40:06.317
- Bert and Ernie.
- No.

40:06.319 --> 40:07.685
- That's weird.
- Yes.

40:07.687 --> 40:08.753
Uh...

40:08.755 --> 40:09.754
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

40:09.756 --> 40:10.688
Dean...

40:10.690 --> 40:11.856
Shaggy and Scooby.

40:11.858 --> 40:13.024
Why would we...

40:13.026 --> 40:14.392
Turner and Hooch.

40:14.394 --> 40:16.027
Ren and Stimpy.

40:16.029 --> 40:18.496
Come on, now.

40:18.498 --> 40:20.097
- Thelma and Louise.
- Thelma and --

40:20.099 --> 40:24.668
We just put it in drive
and go.

40:56.869 --> 40:58.702
What the...

40:58.704 --> 41:01.572
