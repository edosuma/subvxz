She plays the lute,
you know.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.866
Oh, yes,
she was very charming.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.154
And small. She must make
your penis look huge.

11:14.156 --> 11:17.489
I'm sorry?

11:17.743 --> 11:20.160
Charming, Max, charming.

11:20.162 --> 11:22.880
Hi, we just stopped by
to bring you some cupcakes.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.781
We feel so bad
about what happened.

11:24.783 --> 11:26.283
Can we come in
for a minute?

11:26.285 --> 11:29.169
Um, well, I wasn't
expecting company,

11:29.171 --> 11:31.255
but come in.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.007
We're all just hangin' out.

11:33.009 --> 11:37.342
Oh, oh, this isn't weird.
This isn't weird at all.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.447
It's like we're
in a dead body car wash.

11:41.650 --> 11:44.983
I had a nightmare that I had
a nightmare like this once.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.322
Just so you know,

11:48.324 --> 11:51.275
I'm not allowed to talk
about the lawsuit.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.693
Well, I'm not
allowed to talk

11:52.695 --> 11:55.446
about how I really feel
right now.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.865
Speaking of the lawsuit,
you seem well--

11:57.867 --> 11:59.700
you know, physically--
which is great,

11:59.702 --> 12:01.485
because the suit said
you had a shattered arm

12:01.487 --> 12:03.087
and a broken hip.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.172
Oh, yeah,
I'm not suing you

12:05.174 --> 12:07.374
for <i>my</i> shattered arm
and hip.

12:07.376 --> 12:10.709
It's--
it's for Pierre's.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.836
I crushed his little body
when I fell.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.339
He must have thrown himself
under my body

12:22.341 --> 12:25.674
to protect my fall.

12:26.178 --> 12:29.511
Dexter, party of one.

12:30.532 --> 12:34.035
I have to rotate his arm
and hold it every 15 minutes

12:34.036 --> 12:36.019
to get his full range
of motion back.

12:36.021 --> 12:39.354
That's what the sling's about.
I know he's not alive.

12:40.076 --> 12:43.409
Do you?

12:44.163 --> 12:46.296
We're very sorry
for his injury,

12:46.298 --> 12:47.714
but this is absurd.

12:47.716 --> 12:49.883
You can't sue us
because your puppet broke.

12:49.885 --> 12:52.869
Yes, I can.
This puppet is my livelihood,

12:52.871 --> 12:54.505
and he's heavily insured.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.057
Great, the puppet has
insurance, and we don't.

12:57.059 --> 12:58.708
- Max!
- What?

12:58.710 --> 13:00.127
You don't have insurance?

13:00.129 --> 13:02.429
You have a business
but no insurance?

13:02.431 --> 13:05.764
Look, we can't go to court.
It would wreck us.

13:06.102 --> 13:07.651
Can we leave the lawyers
out of this

13:07.653 --> 13:09.486
and come up
with a more creative solution?

13:09.488 --> 13:10.938
I mean,
you're clearly creative.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.690
Look, you even made
a skeleton king.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.392
That's not
a skeleton king.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.495
That's Pazuzu,
prince of darkness.

13:19.497 --> 13:21.031
Let me just
put this out there

13:21.033 --> 13:23.066
because we should really
move things along,

13:23.068 --> 13:25.452
and also, I'm afraid.

13:25.454 --> 13:27.621
How much is it gonna take
to make this go away?

13:27.623 --> 13:29.206
Do you want to take
a second to consult

13:29.208 --> 13:30.290
with one of your roommates?

13:30.292 --> 13:32.759
I think I saw
a lawyer doll.

13:33.261 --> 13:36.094
He is not a lawyer.
He is a maitre d'.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.748
And a damn good one!

13:39.751 --> 13:41.969
You women
just don't get it.

13:41.971 --> 13:44.921
This is why I broke up
with my Toronto-based girlfriend

13:44.923 --> 13:46.807
over Skype.

13:46.809 --> 13:49.526
Right?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.529
$1,000 by Monday.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.231
But if she makes
another comment

13:54.233 --> 13:57.566
about my intricate, hand-carved
marionettes being dolls...

13:58.370 --> 14:01.703
[Whistles]
It goes up.

14:02.491 --> 14:05.325
Fine, $1,000
and no strings.

14:05.327 --> 14:08.660
- Except for the ones on all--
- Max, don't say it!

<i>Hello Dolly,</i> Dollywood,

14:16.121 --> 14:19.454
and the Dalai Lama!

14:21.393 --> 14:23.310
Those are the things
I was holding in.

14:23.312 --> 14:26.645
Oh, wait--
Doll and Oates!

14:28.901 --> 14:32.234
Now what? How are we gonna get
1,000 extra dollars by Monday?

14:32.938 --> 14:34.938
Wait, Max, we can go
to that bar

14:34.940 --> 14:36.690
and exploit
your special gifts.

14:36.692 --> 14:40.025
If I have to strip,
I have to strip.

14:40.145 --> 14:43.447
Not that kind of bar,
the hipster trivia bar.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.915
Can't I just strip?

14:44.917 --> 14:47.200
At least I'd still have
my dignity.

14:55.213 --> 14:57.264
It's all here. $1,000.

14:57.516 --> 15:00.267
So that's it.
No more lawsuit.

15:00.269 --> 15:01.718
Actually, that's not it.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.854
As it turns out,
we're gonna need 500 more.

15:03.856 --> 15:06.807
For what? Did your dues
for the serial killer's union

15:06.809 --> 15:10.142
and the pedophile guild come up
at the same time this year?

15:10.512 --> 15:13.697
Pierre's in crisis!

15:13.699 --> 15:17.032
But his psychiatrist could
tell you more about that.

15:17.453 --> 15:19.786
If there's a psychiatrist
in this apartment

15:19.788 --> 15:23.121
who hasn't locked him up,
I don't trust his opinion.

15:23.859 --> 15:27.192
[In old man voice]
I'm Dr. Pangloss.

15:27.629 --> 15:30.962
Pierre broke more than his hip
in your cupcake shop.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.333
He broke his spirit.

15:35.554 --> 15:38.887
He lost his <i>dream!</i>

15:39.424 --> 15:42.757
He no longer wants
to perform.

15:46.431 --> 15:48.047
This is
where he cuts us in half

15:48.049 --> 15:49.816
and sews my top
to your bottom.

15:49.818 --> 15:52.569
On the plus side,
we'd look amazing.

15:52.571 --> 15:54.104
[Normal voice]
Yeah, well, you heard it.

15:54.356 --> 15:56.639
Pierre's ready
to give up his art,

15:56.641 --> 15:58.908
and he needs
a little more money.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.528
Forget it, puppet nuts.
We don't have $500.

16:01.530 --> 16:03.530
We don't have 500 anything.

16:03.532 --> 16:05.832
Well, think about it.
[Tea kettle whistling]

16:05.834 --> 16:08.501
That's my tea kettle.
Yvette!

16:08.503 --> 16:10.120
Uhh! I'll do it.

16:10.622 --> 16:13.455
I'm not so sure the hostility
is quite working,

16:13.508 --> 16:15.091
so why don't you
go wait in the hall?

16:15.093 --> 16:16.926
And I'll try to talk
some sense into him alone.

16:16.928 --> 16:18.795
You are the only person
in the world

16:18.797 --> 16:20.598
who would insist
on being alone with this man,

16:20.599 --> 16:22.599
but okay.

16:22.601 --> 16:25.668
Please just listen.
We are broke.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.771
To get any more money,
we'd have to strip.

16:27.773 --> 16:31.057
Well, Gigi and Lana
started off as strippers,

16:31.059 --> 16:34.392
and now they're
in the Folies Bergere, so...

16:35.731 --> 16:38.148
You know, even
for a middle-aged puppeteer,

16:38.150 --> 16:39.182
you're a freak.

16:39.484 --> 16:42.517
See you in court!

16:42.888 --> 16:45.405
Nothing.
He's gonna sue us,

16:45.407 --> 16:47.323
and we have no other tricks
up our sleeve.

16:47.325 --> 16:50.658
Well, maybe not my sleeve,
but how about my <i>coat?</i>

16:51.296 --> 16:54.629
- Pierre?
- Right there.

17:03.808 --> 17:06.476
I'm sorry,
we're not open today.

17:06.478 --> 17:09.810
I know you took him.
Give me back Pierre!

17:10.431 --> 17:11.647
We're not open.

17:11.650 --> 17:13.483
We've had
a terrible tragedy.

17:13.484 --> 17:15.602
Well, not us,
but a new friend of ours

17:15.604 --> 17:18.936
had a gruesome accident,
and we are just devastated.

17:19.241 --> 17:21.741
You wouldn't be
that cruel.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.194
Relax, I could never be
that cruel.

17:24.195 --> 17:25.194
But Max could.

17:25.196 --> 17:28.530
Well, well, well.

17:30.618 --> 17:33.951
Look who it is, Pierre,
your lover, J. Petto!

17:35.006 --> 17:38.339
He's not gay.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.409
He had a girlfriend
named Lulu.

17:40.411 --> 17:43.263
She was a--she was a courtesan
in the court of a French king.

17:43.265 --> 17:45.348
They broke up
over a brief flirtation she had

17:45.350 --> 17:47.350
with Yvette.

17:47.352 --> 17:50.653
And I know
they're not alive!

17:50.655 --> 17:53.988
Now, what do you say we stick
to the original no-strings deal?

17:54.759 --> 17:56.392
'Cause if you don't,
Max will show you

17:56.394 --> 17:59.727
what "no strings"
really means.

17:59.981 --> 18:02.031
Do it! Go!
Bring it!

18:02.033 --> 18:05.366
I can always re-string him.
I'm a master of my craft.

18:06.304 --> 18:08.788
Yes, we thought
you'd say that.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.874
So you leave us no choice.
Max...

18:10.876 --> 18:13.026
What? I--

18:13.028 --> 18:14.794
I'm not changing my mind.

18:14.796 --> 18:18.129
And I'm coming back
with the police.

18:18.884 --> 18:22.135
Oh, I wouldn't get
the cops involved...

18:22.137 --> 18:24.087
Now that your boy here
is in a...

18:24.089 --> 18:27.422
Compromising situation!

18:42.740 --> 18:46.073
How dare you!

18:46.278 --> 18:49.611
And she does not like
the feel of a condom!

18:51.917 --> 18:54.868
You two are sick!

18:54.870 --> 18:57.704
Hey, we don't judge.

18:57.706 --> 19:00.006
We think whatever
two consenting dolls,

19:00.008 --> 19:03.341
or maybe <i>three</i>
consenting dolls do--

19:04.045 --> 19:06.179
and it's gonna be bad

19:06.181 --> 19:09.514
'cause he's a grower,
not a shower.

19:14.271 --> 19:17.557
And once a few of these pics
are posted online,

19:17.559 --> 19:20.509
there goes your children's
party business.

19:20.511 --> 19:23.844
Now, call it quits,
and you can delete these pics.

19:24.015 --> 19:26.733
Fine. Yes. Okay, you win.
You win. You win.

19:26.735 --> 19:29.452
Oh, we're not falling
for your word again.

19:29.454 --> 19:31.571
If you want
your doll back--

19:31.573 --> 19:34.906
For the last time,
he is not a doll!

19:35.377 --> 19:37.210
Bring us
a notarized letter saying

19:37.212 --> 19:38.861
you release
Max's Homemade Cupcakes

19:38.863 --> 19:40.630
of all further legal action,

19:40.632 --> 19:42.966
and we'll give you back Pierre,
perfectly intact.

19:42.968 --> 19:46.002
Minus his virginity,
of course.

19:46.004 --> 19:49.337
But don't worry,
you'll still have yours.

19:50.475 --> 19:53.593
Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

19:53.595 --> 19:56.928
Ugh, 30 years in
the cutthroat world of puppets,

19:57.232 --> 20:00.565
and I'm undone
by two crazy cupcake bitches!

20:06.390 --> 20:09.492
Did you hear that?
30 years?

20:09.494 --> 20:12.827
30 years of following his dream,
and he's still broke?

20:12.897 --> 20:14.280
Is that gonna be us, Max?

20:14.282 --> 20:16.666
Is our dream just as stupid
as puppets?

20:16.668 --> 20:19.118
Sorry, Pierre,
I forgot you were here.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.736
He's sound asleep.

20:20.738 --> 20:23.206
Three-ways really
take it out of you.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.791
Here, dress her.
She has to get a cab.

20:24.793 --> 20:27.710
She'd rather sleep
in her own bed.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.515
And do you know why we're
not gonna turn into him?

20:32.517 --> 20:34.717
Because 30 years ago,
when J. Petto said,

20:34.719 --> 20:36.269
"I'm gonna be
a puppeteer,"

20:36.271 --> 20:37.937
he didn't have a best friend
to tell him,

20:37.939 --> 20:40.690
"You shouldn't do that.
It's a stupid idea."

20:40.692 --> 20:42.425
And unlike him,
you have me to tell you

20:42.427 --> 20:43.860
when it's a stupid idea.

20:43.862 --> 20:45.695
And I have you to tell me
not to mace myself,

20:45.697 --> 20:48.931
no matter how bad
I want to know how it feels.

20:48.933 --> 20:51.451
So the cupcake shop
isn't a stupid idea?

20:51.453 --> 20:53.619
No. And it's actually starting
to take off.

20:53.621 --> 20:56.605
'Cause no one embraces
a stupid idea like a hipster.

20:56.607 --> 20:59.042
But, Max,
we do need insurance.

20:59.044 --> 21:01.160
- But do we have the money?
- No.

21:01.162 --> 21:02.580
What are the chances
someone else is gonna fall?

21:02.581 --> 21:03.797
A million to one.

21:03.799 --> 21:06.049
I like those odds.

21:06.301 --> 21:08.334
You know, this is
a really cute dress.

21:08.336 --> 21:09.502
[Scoffs]
Forget the dress.

21:09.554 --> 21:11.671
Look at his cute pants.

21:11.673 --> 21:14.724

to Han.
