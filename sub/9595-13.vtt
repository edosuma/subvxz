No tone.
It's just after 15 years,

out of fabiano's.

I had to leave
most of them at school.

that many people in our class.

How does a boob like you get
more valentines than me?

Maybe by not calling
people "boobs."

I can start with --

Tell us about the short rib.
Is it tender?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.578
And here we go.
You know what?

'cause I was actually looking
at the jidori chicken.

how to give a compliment.

Fine. But for the record,
I am doubtful of all you people.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.684
Okay,
just look at jack

05:52.686 --> 05:54.486
And say something nice
about him.

05:57.757 --> 05:58.890
I'm sorry.

nice about him?

I see what you're saying.
It is kind of long.

to be a nice person

before the hurtful part

Of what you're thinking
comes out.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.522

09:14.688 --> 09:16.755
And how your night
went off the rails.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.657
Hello. I'm keith.

Hi, keith.
Hi, keith.

To tell my wife
I'm going on a golf trip.

I'm jonas.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.264
Hi, jonas.
Hi, jonas.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.634
And made her walk six blocks
in stilettos,

09:29.636 --> 09:31.336
Which she's been stabbing
my foot with

09:31.338 --> 09:32.671
Under the table
ever since.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.172
Mm.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.642
Told my wife her naan
is not as puffy as my mom's.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.677
Ooh.
Oh.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.278
So, it's not just me.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.180
No, sir.
It's not just you.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.349
And it's not
just valentine's.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.586
Birthdays, anniversaries,
new year's eve.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.621
The bigger the night,
the bigger the fight.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.756
Oh, but why does it always
have to turn to crap?

09:51.758 --> 09:55.260
Ours
is not to reason why.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.296
Ours
is but to do and die.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.699
Hmm?
Alfred, lord tennyson.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.367
And you work
in a bathroom?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.769
Poetry major.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.271
Gotcha.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.740
So, uh, let's hear
your war story.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.241
Well, I'm dre.

10:10.243 --> 10:15.146
<i>But I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>with a war council.</i>

10:15.148 --> 10:17.382
So annoying.
You know what I mean?

Who is he? Huh?
To judge what I'm wearing?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.687

just rise above.

and save your night.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.228
How long have
you two been married?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.664
Oh, we just got
engaged last week.
Oh, okay.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.299
I liked it,
so I put a ring on it.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.234
[ laughter ]

10:36.236 --> 10:39.304
Okay, first of all, you need
to update your playlist.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.674
Once the two of you have
actually gotten married?

10:42.676 --> 10:45.377
Because then everything
is about setting a precedent.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.313
It's not just a fight about him
leaving the milk on the counter.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.715
It's a fight about him
leaving the milk on the counter

10:50.717 --> 10:52.417
For the rest of your life.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.718
Do you understand?

10:53.720 --> 10:57.689
Do you like
hot counter milk?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.224
Um...
No.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.225
...No.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.259
Well, he's gonna
leave it there.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.294
By the way,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.363
When I said you could
try my short rib,

11:05.365 --> 11:07.198
I kind of meant
just a bite.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.234
Oh.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.671
But you know this should've
been mine, right?

11:12.673 --> 11:14.172
Okay, diane, remember --

11:14.174 --> 11:16.207
Just say the first half
of your thought.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.711
Zoey, you have nice hair.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.447
Jack...

11:22.449 --> 11:25.216
You dance well.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.719
Junior...

11:31.424 --> 11:33.324
...You're good
at computers.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.294
Sure you don't
want to say more?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.229
Don't
poke the bear.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.231
No. I'm done.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.234
I wrote down the rest
of what I wanted to say.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.411
I should not
have read this.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.382
Junior, get off.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.185
I-I mean, it's the kind of thing
that just throws you,

12:00.187 --> 12:02.253
Even if it's a natural part
of childbirth.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.291
I guess I did to valentine's
what she did to that poor table.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.393
Yes, but you could
still win the night.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.230
All you did was make a foolish
inquiry about her romper.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.333
But she came back
at you so hard,

12:15.335 --> 12:17.402
She lost
the moral high ground.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.306
Oh, I get it.
Now dre is the victim.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.208
Precisely.
Wow.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.077
This is crazy.
Totally uncharted.

W-what's my play?

12:27.347 --> 12:30.215
Amp up your hurt.
Work her guilt.

Don't ease up until you hear
the words "I'm sorry."

12:32.419 --> 12:34.285
Trust me, dre.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.088
No one else in here
is having sex tonight,

12:37.090 --> 12:38.456
But if you play it right,

12:38.458 --> 12:41.159
You can have special sex.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.393
Special sex?

<i>Yes, that's what I'll be --</i>

13:55.302 --> 13:57.368
Well, since you're
apologizing for this,

13:57.370 --> 14:01.272
I gather you can scrounge up
some more apologies.

14:02.408 --> 14:07.378
And what else exactly
would I apologize for?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.113
Ah, well, for starters,

the greatest mug of all time.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.130
Perfect for coffee,
perfect for soup.

a large head, bow.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.853
Hmm?
...I can't argue with that.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.890
I mean, I just feel like if you
hold stuff in for too long,

19:18.892 --> 19:21.759
Eventually, it's gonna blow up
at the wrong time.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.794
Ooh, ooh, baby, guess who
I think I saw

19:23.796 --> 19:25.563
At the restaurant tonight?

19:25.565 --> 19:26.697
Gene hackman.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.832
[ chuckles ]

19:27.834 --> 19:28.833
What? Oh. Oh.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.635
You like it rough today,
huh?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.669
Happy valenti--

19:31.671 --> 19:33.771
[ muffled shouting ]

19:33.773 --> 19:35.806
Wow. Ugly.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.575
Yes.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.910
I love you.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.778
I don't want to kill you.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.581
You know we could go
the other way, too.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.815
Mm.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.919
Have you seen
my billy ocean t-shirt?

19:47.921 --> 19:49.787
What?! That's it!

19:49.789 --> 19:53.624
Feel free to remarry,
and find the kids a good dad.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.625
Aah!

19:54.627 --> 19:58.763
Are we a bad couple
for going at it like that?

19:58.765 --> 20:00.665
I mean, we went ballistic.
Face it, babe.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.700
We're both strong-ass cups
of tea

20:02.702 --> 20:04.635
Who do not like
to back down.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.970
No, we do not.
Mnh-mnh.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.739
Which is why
the good people at hallmark

20:08.741 --> 20:10.675
Invented valentime's day.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.543
Ah. Huh.
Babe.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.878
It's our fight night.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.813
It really is.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.682
âª get up, get up,
get up, get up âª

20:17.684 --> 20:19.884
It's also when we do
our best making up.

20:19.886 --> 20:20.918
Mm-hmm.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.823
âª oh, baby, now let's get down
tonight âª

20:25.825 --> 20:27.825
âª when I get that feeling âª
seriously, though...
Hmm?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.627
âª I want sexual healing âª
you're gonna read
"hoodfellas."

20:29.629 --> 20:31.762
I really don't want to.
It's okay.
I'll read it to you.

20:31.764 --> 20:32.930
âª sexual healing âª
no.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.870
"the action's gone.
Can't even get good grub.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.939
"last week, I tried to order
chicken and waffles

20:41.941 --> 20:43.774
"and got tofu and quinoa.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.910
"I'm an average homeboy.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.646
"get to live
the rest of my life

20:48.648 --> 20:50.781
Like
a schnookity-schnook."

20:50.783 --> 20:52.583
What do you think?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
Goodbye.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.521
Where you going?

20:57.523 --> 20:58.723
Aah!
Bow, no!

20:58.725 --> 21:00.658
I love it.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.560
Really?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.528
Want to read
"hood will hunting"?

21:04.530 --> 21:07.565
No. I...

21:07.567 --> 21:08.866
I want to digest this.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.735
Oh. Yeah.
Okay.
