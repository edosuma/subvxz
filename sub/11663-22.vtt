(serene music playing)

01:07.834 --> 01:09.100
What are you doing, Rose?

01:09.166 --> 01:11.300
I'm wrapping Miles'
birthday present.

01:11.367 --> 01:13.133
I got him a golf club.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.767
But don't tell him. It's a surprise.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.200
Rose, you got to use
some imagination.

01:20.266 --> 01:22.500
I know what men like
for their birthdays,

01:22.567 --> 01:27.100
a surprise that makes their libidos
stand up and say, "Hello there."

01:27.600 --> 01:31.633
Oh, I know. You can give Miles
one of those boudoir photographs,

01:31.700 --> 01:34.767
where you pose for pictures
in sexy lingerie.

01:34.834 --> 01:39.367
Oh, I don't know. I'd feel cheap,
like... well, like you.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.133
Oh, Rose, come on.
It's a great idea.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.000
The pictures are an intimate way

01:48.066 --> 01:51.633
to tell a fella he's the only
man in your life.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.400
I've done it 20, 30 times.

01:56.834 --> 01:59.834
Dorothy, how would you feel
about a birthday present

01:59.900 --> 02:02.133
of a picture of me
in sexy lingerie?

02:04.633 --> 02:06.266
I'd rather have the cash.

02:09.033 --> 02:11.433
Actually, it's not for you.
It's for Miles.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.233
He'd rather have the cash.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.700
Wait. Are you talking about
those ridiculous pictures

02:17.767 --> 02:19.667
Blanche puts on her
Christmas cards?

02:20.767 --> 02:25.166
Those cards are a moving tribute
to the spirit of the season.

02:25.233 --> 02:28.867
Moving tribute? The three wise
men and you in a teddy

02:28.934 --> 02:30.667
following the Christmas star?

02:32.367 --> 02:34.633
Rose, if you're not
doing anything right now,

02:34.700 --> 02:36.700
come with me to Career Day
at school.

02:36.767 --> 02:40.533
After I finish speaking, we can
go shopping for Miles' gift.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.333
You're speaking at Career Day?

02:42.400 --> 02:44.567
Yeah, not that I want to.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.300
I'm working in the
"careers in teaching" booth.

02:47.367 --> 02:51.233
Miles will be there too,
speaking about teaching in college.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.266
Oh, speaking at Career Day
is quite a responsibility.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.100
I'll never forget Career Day
at my high school.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.667
Check, please.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.567
Gunter Hanchop, St. Olaf's
leading shepherd and notary,

03:07.633 --> 03:09.133
came to speak.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.333
Ah, it was so moving
when he talked about

03:11.400 --> 03:14.000
his solitary existence
with the sheep.

03:16.967 --> 03:20.600
No human contact
for months at a time.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.033
Oh, just building
a special relationship

03:23.100 --> 03:26.033
with God's simple creatures.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.233
I really wanted to help.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.100
So you decided to become
a shepherd?

03:30.166 --> 03:35.266
No. I decided to give Gunter
a case of scotch.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.633
And he really
appreciated it,

03:36.700 --> 03:40.367
until he discovered
what mean drunks sheep are.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.033
They're kind of like cows
when they're drunk.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.166
You know what I mean?

03:48.834 --> 03:51.967
Actually, that shepherd was
probably better qualified

03:52.033 --> 03:54.133
to speak at career day than I.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.633
I mean, how can I tell the kids
how rewarding teaching is,

03:57.700 --> 03:59.900
when I really don't feel
that way anymore?

03:59.967 --> 04:02.266
I mean, I'm so frustrated.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.200
Budgets are tight,
classes are crowded.

04:05.266 --> 04:08.900
If I'm lucky, I get
to substitute in English class.

04:08.967 --> 04:11.934
But usually it's...
oh, I can't even say it.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.300
Driver's ed?

04:14.734 --> 04:18.367
God, how I hate putting up
those damn cones!

04:20.867 --> 04:23.200
Oh, Dorothy, come on now.
You'll do just fine.

04:23.266 --> 04:26.600
I will never forget Career Day
at my high school.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.533
It was a turning point in my life.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.834
That day, I decided
to marry a man who had one.

04:33.934 --> 04:37.166
(mellow music playing)

04:37.233 --> 04:40.900
As I was saying,
teaching has many rewards,

04:40.967 --> 04:43.834
but none so great
as knowing you've passed on

04:43.900 --> 04:47.000
the tradition of American education.

04:47.066 --> 04:48.500
Now, are there any questions?

04:48.567 --> 04:52.033
Mrs. Zbornak, what does
Joe say about all this?

04:52.100 --> 04:53.233
Joe who?

04:53.300 --> 04:55.100
Joe Mama!
Ha-ha-ha!

05:00.333 --> 05:03.667
I think we ought to call that
boudoir photographer today

05:03.734 --> 05:04.567
and make an appointment.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.500
Blanche, I won't do it.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.700
You're making a big mistake.

05:08.767 --> 05:12.066
Make yourself more interesting
to Miles, or you'll lose him.

05:12.133 --> 05:14.867
He's at school every day
with other women

05:14.934 --> 05:16.200
just looking for trouble.

05:16.266 --> 05:18.333
Oh, no, he is not.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.133
Look at him now,
talking to that young thing.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.967
I know exactly what he's saying.

05:24.033 --> 05:27.700
"Hey, Cindy,
why don't I buy you a drink?

05:27.767 --> 05:30.467
Or even better,
let's both get naked."

05:31.734 --> 05:35.367
"Why, that's a great idea,
and I'd say yes in a minute,

05:35.433 --> 05:37.367
but I thought you had a girlfriend."

05:37.433 --> 05:40.266
"Oh, we have an understanding,
honey.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.900
I don't tell her
I'm fooling around,

05:43.967 --> 05:45.800
and she doesn't
ask any questions.

05:45.867 --> 05:46.834
Heh-heh-heh!"

05:46.900 --> 05:48.867
Blanche, I think
I've heard enough.

05:48.934 --> 05:50.567
I don't want to hear
another word.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.133
Have it your way.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.367
We have to get
to the photographer now.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.700
And, so, are there
any questions?

05:57.767 --> 06:02.100
Yeah. What does Joe have
to say about all this?

06:08.300 --> 06:09.633
Mrs. Zbornak?

06:09.700 --> 06:10.834
That's right.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.000
You taught English,
Eastwick high, 1975,

06:14.066 --> 06:16.200
when Mr. Martinez
had his sex change?

06:18.400 --> 06:21.800
Yes! I was there
for the whole semester

06:21.867 --> 06:24.266
while he went shopping
for new clothes.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.533
How's he doing?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.533
He married Mr. Adkins,
the gym teacher.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.633
Do I know you?

06:30.700 --> 06:32.533
You probably don't remember.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.266
Randy Becker, American lit?

06:35.333 --> 06:39.200
Of course! Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

06:39.266 --> 06:40.800
That's my booth over there.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.500
Borealis.

06:42.567 --> 06:45.767
Randy "Mr. Ditch" Becker.

06:45.834 --> 06:49.767
And I knew where you were
ditching every time too,

06:49.834 --> 06:54.367
at the arcade, wasting hour
after hour, day after day,

06:54.433 --> 06:58.100
playing those senseless
pinball machines.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.834
Boy, look at you now.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.567
What business are you in?

07:01.633 --> 07:03.567
Video games.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.100
I've made millions
in video games.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.900
This is so strange.

07:07.967 --> 07:10.000
You teach kids year after year,

07:10.066 --> 07:12.767
but you never know
how they turn out.

07:12.834 --> 07:16.200
Look at you.
You turned out just great.

07:16.266 --> 07:18.800
'75 was a big year for me.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.767
My grades were in the toilet.

07:20.834 --> 07:25.367
I was ready to bail, till they
brought in Attila the sub.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.233
I loved that name.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.533
I earned that name.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.033
Boy, you really got on my case.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.400
I appreciate what you did,
Mrs. Zbornak.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.166
Oh, please. Tilla.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.700
I just had the craziest idea.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.667
If you can inspire
goof-off kids like me,

07:48.734 --> 07:51.100
think what you could do
with my sales force.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.900
What are you
talking about?

07:52.967 --> 07:57.233
I need a motivational trainer,
a teacher. You'd be perfect.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.567
Randy Becker,
are you offering me a job?

08:00.633 --> 08:02.800
The benefits are pretty good,
the pay's great,

08:02.867 --> 08:04.600
and you'd have
a health plan.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.500
I just have to see what Joe
has to say about all this.

08:08.533 --> 08:13.834
You just have to see what Joe
has to say about all this.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.567
And this Joe, would he
happen to be Joe Mama?

08:22.433 --> 08:24.734
Joe Stewart.
He's my business partner.

08:25.734 --> 08:30.200
Oh, of course.
No. Joe Mama's with IBM.

08:34.266 --> 08:36.934
(soft music playing)

08:38.333 --> 08:40.567
You taking Rose
to that dirty-picture place?

08:40.633 --> 08:41.967
Yep.

08:42.033 --> 08:45.533
I'm sorry I didn't think
to have her picture painted.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.533
I've always wanted
to sit for a portrait.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.834
An artist could use his palette

08:50.900 --> 08:54.233
to bring out my
distinctive personality,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.567
my southern fieriness.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.166
He could showcase
my inner beauty.

08:59.233 --> 09:01.633
Plus he could cheat
and paint your head to scale.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.834
Well... how do I look?

09:06.900 --> 09:09.533
Look at Dorothy,
ready for her first day

09:09.600 --> 09:12.133
as a successful
businesswoman.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.500
Go get them, tiger!

09:13.567 --> 09:15.533
You look wonderful, Dorothy,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.767
but don't you think
those shoulder pads

09:17.834 --> 09:19.900
make you seem
a little aggressive?

09:20.400 --> 09:22.567
I'm not wearing
shoulder pads.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.166
Oh.

09:28.533 --> 09:31.867
Well, in that case,
go get them, tiger!

09:31.934 --> 09:33.767
Ma, I've been thinking.

09:33.834 --> 09:37.734
Since I got a raise in salary,
you should get one too.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.233
And you ask
why I love this woman.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.600
Somebody deserves a hug for that.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.133
But before I do,

09:45.200 --> 09:47.367
let's find out exactly
how much I love you.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.367
Aw, come on.

09:50.433 --> 09:52.500
I love you more than that.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.133
Stan loved you more than that.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.467
Love, love, love that woman!

10:00.567 --> 10:04.233
Well, I'm off. Wish me luck.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.667
Oh, wait a minute, pussycat.
I almost forgot.

10:06.734 --> 10:08.133
I packed you a lunch.

10:10.533 --> 10:13.367
Oh, Ma, you didn't
have to do that.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.333
I wanted to.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.300
It's the same lunch I packed
for your first day of school,

10:18.367 --> 10:21.033
salami and a thermos of wine.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.600
Remember
when you're at work today, be proud.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.367
You're a Petrillo,
which in Italian means,

10:29.433 --> 10:31.233
"Hey, I'm on a break here."

10:35.066 --> 10:36.734
Well, I'm ready.

10:42.033 --> 10:45.400
Where are you going with that thing?

10:45.467 --> 10:47.800
This is what I'm wearing for
the photographer.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.533
It's the nightgown that makes Miles,
you know, hot.

10:54.934 --> 10:57.233
Maybe it's the, you know, flannel.

10:59.467 --> 11:03.133
Don't wear something Miles
sees you in all the time.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
This is fantasy.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.266
Dress up to please him.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.300
I'll help you with a costume.
What's he like?

11:09.367 --> 11:12.233
Well, he's serious
and conservative

11:12.300 --> 11:14.567
and concerned about
the world around him.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.100
I know. A nursie.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.367
He'd like a nursie.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.166
Yeah, come on.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.367
(calm music playing)

11:23.433 --> 11:26.700
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.000
My name is Dorothy Zbornak.

11:29.066 --> 11:31.734
For the next week,
we'll be exploring

11:31.800 --> 11:34.767
the skills involved
in articulating ideas

11:34.834 --> 11:36.900
and relating them to other people.

11:36.967 --> 11:39.100
(groans)

11:39.166 --> 11:42.500
I realize you haven't been
in a classroom in years,

11:42.567 --> 11:45.533
but I promise you
this won't be like school.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.467
I've already read
the book for the class,

11:48.533 --> 11:52.133
and I've also completed all
the assignments for the class.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.300
This is a special report
I've written,

11:54.367 --> 11:57.667
based on extra research
I've done for the class.

11:58.166 --> 12:01.333
We're never going to
beat you people, are we?

12:03.633 --> 12:06.867
The rest of us have
a lot to cover today,

12:06.934 --> 12:08.266
or we'll fall behind.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.934
You're not really going to teach,
are you?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.734
That is the idea.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.066
We're here because we know
how to do our jobs.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.467
That's why they gave us
a free week in Miami.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.834
Usually, we come to a seminar,

12:20.900 --> 12:23.800
you check off our names,
and we go play golf.

12:23.867 --> 12:25.567
You're happy,
we're happy.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.500
Ok, Harry, I've just checked
off your name. You're free to go.

12:31.567 --> 12:34.400
If anybody else wants to go,
feel free to.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.633
However, if you'd like
to learn something,

12:37.700 --> 12:41.266
then I strongly suggest
that you stay.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.367
(serene music playing)

12:51.433 --> 12:53.433
Now, that's a good one.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.100
Oh, that's a nice one too.

12:55.166 --> 12:58.367
Really? You don't think
I'm showing too much skin?

12:58.433 --> 12:59.900
Rose, move your thumb.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.266
Oh!

13:02.333 --> 13:03.700
Look at this one.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.266
That's beautiful.
Absolutely breathtaking.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.834
That looks like something you'd see
on a calendar in a muffler shop.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.100
Oh, go on.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.500
Do you really think
that's right for Miles?

13:16.567 --> 13:18.767
He's never seen
that side of me before.

13:19.834 --> 13:23.000
You mean the Wanton Rose?

13:23.066 --> 13:24.166
The Harlot?

13:24.233 --> 13:26.233
The elemental woman who cries out

13:26.300 --> 13:29.433
for the fiery, passionate response
of an elemental man?

13:29.500 --> 13:30.867
You mean that side?

13:30.934 --> 13:32.600
Actually, I meant my heinie.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.266
We always make love
with the lights off.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.066
Always?

13:39.133 --> 13:41.633
Always... except for the time

13:41.700 --> 13:45.233
we were listening
to this concert on radio.

13:45.300 --> 13:50.133
And when the applause started,
his clapper went crazy.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.900
The lights went on, off,
on, off, on, off,

13:55.967 --> 14:00.066
and Miles did his impression
of the old King Kong,

14:00.133 --> 14:02.367
and we laughed and laughed.

14:02.433 --> 14:08.100
So I pretended I was Godzilla,
and we wrestled, got all sweaty...

14:08.967 --> 14:12.333
come to think of it, we never
did make love that night.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.433
If you didn't make love,
what did you do?

14:16.500 --> 14:17.967
Destroyed Tokyo.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.633
-Hi, Blanche.
-Hi.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.433
How was your first day at work?

14:24.500 --> 14:27.066
Terrible.
They don't want a teacher.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.867
They just want a body
to stand there

14:29.934 --> 14:33.667
so everyone can write off the trip
as a business expense.

14:33.734 --> 14:36.867
I had such high hopes
for this job.

14:36.934 --> 14:39.133
Now I have no option
but to quit.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.333
Dorothy Zbornak,
you hush yourself.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.133
What?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.867
Just because those people
don't want to learn

14:43.934 --> 14:45.400
doesn't mean
you can't teach.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.867
Yes, it does.

14:46.934 --> 14:48.800
Well, you know this stuff
better than I do.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.567
Oh, Dorothy, there you are.

14:54.633 --> 14:57.433
Dorothy, I'd like you
to meet my friend Lillian.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.600
Lillian, this is my daughter
Dorothy,

14:59.667 --> 15:02.600
the director of executive
training for Borealis.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.700
I think that beats your son
the cable installer.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.166
So nice to meet you, Dorothy.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.367
-It's funny, though.
-What?

15:11.433 --> 15:14.066
I've known Sophia
for almost 25 years,

15:14.133 --> 15:17.233
and until now, I didn't even know
she had a daughter.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.433
I'm sure she must
have mentioned me.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.700
No. She used to always talk
about her parakeet though.

15:27.767 --> 15:30.900
Yeah, she loved that bird.

15:30.967 --> 15:35.533
So, you were married to a prince.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.066
Go with me on this one, pussycat.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.367
I'll explain about
the parakeet later.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.667
Sweetheart,
that was a wonderful dinner.

15:45.734 --> 15:48.633
It was a birthday
I shall never forget.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.700
This one isn't over yet.

15:50.767 --> 15:53.934
-It's time for your present.
-Oh, hello, Fay Wray.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.567
-Bring on the plane!
-Down, Kong.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.333
I'm talking about an actual gift.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.200
-Oh. An actual gift. Well...
-(doorbell rings)

16:03.266 --> 16:04.567
Who can that be?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.834
Surprise!

16:07.900 --> 16:10.433
Well, Rose,
look who's here.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.367
My colleagues from
the English department.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.967
Gentlemen, this is Rose.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.433
Hi, Rose.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.033
Come on in. We were unwrapping
Rose's present.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.967
We don't have to right now.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.000
Hey.

16:21.066 --> 16:23.100
Don't let us spoil your
birthday party. Go ahead.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.367
-No, Miles, please, don't open it.
-Why?

16:26.433 --> 16:27.934
It's a naughty
picture of me.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.467
A naughty picture of you?
Oh, Rose Nylund... oh!

16:33.533 --> 16:35.633
(whistles)

16:35.700 --> 16:39.967
(soft music playing)

16:43.667 --> 16:46.567
Before you all check
your names off and leave,

16:46.633 --> 16:49.066
I would like a few moments
of your time.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.667
When I first took this job,

16:53.734 --> 16:56.467
I just assumed
that teaching adults

16:56.533 --> 16:59.033
would be easier
than teaching kids.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.166
Obviously, I was wrong.

17:01.233 --> 17:04.800
True, it is hard to teach
an old dog new tricks,

17:04.867 --> 17:08.467
but believe me,
it is not impossible.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.233
Open your minds.

17:10.300 --> 17:14.567
Walk down new roads. Shake
the cobwebs from your brains.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.367
There's a time to play,
a time to learn,

17:17.433 --> 17:20.934
and believe me, gentlemen,
your lives will be much better

17:21.000 --> 17:24.033
if you make this a time to learn.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.700
That was very moving.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.767
I'm almost tempted to stay.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.967
That was very inspirational,
Mrs. Zbornak.

17:39.033 --> 17:41.633
Excuse me.
I must catch up with Tojo.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.233
Tojo who?

17:43.300 --> 17:45.233
Tojo Mama!

17:49.667 --> 17:51.900
I got a message
that you wanted to see me.

17:51.967 --> 17:53.467
Am I in trouble?

17:53.533 --> 17:55.467
I wanted you to come

17:55.533 --> 17:58.767
so you'd see how good I was
at firing up a class,

17:58.834 --> 18:01.867
but obviously, it backfired.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.667
Hey, it doesn't matter.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.800
Look, this is a very easy job.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.533
You know who did it before you?
A tape recorder.

18:09.033 --> 18:12.600
Enjoy it. It's my way
of saying thank you.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.600
I appreciate the gesture,

18:14.667 --> 18:17.800
but I think I'm better off
in high school.

18:17.867 --> 18:21.400
What can you get there
that I'm not giving you here?

18:21.467 --> 18:23.533
A student like you.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.800
All these gentlemen
were goof-offs,

18:26.867 --> 18:31.600
and you were a goof-off, but I
managed to cut you off at the pass.

18:31.667 --> 18:36.633
The pass is about the 10th grade,
and that's where I belong.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.233
Well, if that's what
you really want to do, ok.

18:41.300 --> 18:45.500
If there's anything I can ever
do for you, you let me know.

18:45.567 --> 18:49.767
Actually, I do have an idea
for a new video game.

18:49.834 --> 18:50.700
Really?

18:50.767 --> 18:55.166
See, there's this very old,
white-haired mother

18:55.233 --> 18:58.633
who keeps talking
and talking and talking,

18:58.700 --> 19:01.433
and there are all these
different ways to kill her.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.066
Sounds kind of weird.

19:05.133 --> 19:06.200
I've thought it all out.

19:06.266 --> 19:08.900
And then when you arrive
at level four,

19:08.967 --> 19:12.066
then you get to just...
nuke her.

19:14.233 --> 19:17.767
I'm mean, just...
nuke the hell out of her.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.066
(calm music playing)

19:23.133 --> 19:24.667
Oh, I know.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.900
Honey, you've just
got to find a way

19:26.967 --> 19:29.633
to turn this negative
into a positive.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.767
What was supposed to have been
a private, intimate moment

19:32.834 --> 19:34.166
between you and your boyfriend

19:34.233 --> 19:37.834
turned into a sordid exhibition
in front of strange men.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.166
And what's the positive?

19:42.233 --> 19:44.500
I slept with the photographer.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.300
(whistling)

19:47.367 --> 19:49.400
(doorbell rings)

19:54.066 --> 19:57.033
Rose, I came over
as soon as the guys left.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.600
What were you thinking,
dashing off that way?

19:59.667 --> 20:01.033
I felt awful.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.767
That picture
was meant for you.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.133
I feel like a complete fool.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.934
Oh, sweetheart, no.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.500
Listen, let me tell you something.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.000
When I was in the army,

20:13.066 --> 20:16.400
inside my locker,
I kept a picture of Betty Grable.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.700
She was wearing a lot less
than you were wearing

20:18.767 --> 20:20.734
in my birthday photo.

20:20.800 --> 20:25.000
Sweetheart, she was
the darling of America.

20:25.066 --> 20:27.066
She was in her 20s

20:27.133 --> 20:29.734
and had the most beautiful legs
on the planet.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.834
The second most beautiful.

20:32.900 --> 20:33.967
Oh, Miles.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.433
Rita Hayworth had
a set of gams on her. Boy!

20:38.900 --> 20:43.500
Well, look, sweetheart,
about the age thing,

20:43.567 --> 20:47.300
something I read someplace
I've always believed.

20:47.367 --> 20:50.166
You know, when you're
young and beautiful,

20:50.233 --> 20:52.266
it's an accident of nature.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.166
But when you're beautiful older,
you've earned it.

20:55.233 --> 20:58.033
That you created yourself.

20:58.533 --> 21:01.233
Do you really think
my picture's beautiful?

21:01.300 --> 21:05.300
Rose, if I still had a locker,
you'd be in it.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.333
Oh, Miles.

21:08.467 --> 21:12.100
(serene music playing)

21:18.233 --> 21:21.400
Ma, what is that?

21:21.467 --> 21:23.433
It's my new big-screen TV,

21:23.500 --> 21:25.900
thanks to you and the generous
raise in my allowance.

21:25.967 --> 21:29.200
Isn't she a beauty?
Only 1,300 easy payments.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.667
Ma, we have to talk.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.600
The salesman tried
to jerk me around.

21:34.667 --> 21:38.600
Once he found out I was
Jessica Tandy, I got a deal.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.033
Ma, I wouldn't get
too attached to this.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.700
I've named her Tanya.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.533
Ma, I quit my job at Borealis.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.867
I'm going back to teaching,

21:49.934 --> 21:53.433
which means I'll have to tighten
the purse strings around here.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.200
And this affects me how?

21:57.166 --> 21:59.500
You're not making this any easier.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.834
I quit because
I wasn't happy there.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.266
You want me to stay
someplace I was unhappy

22:04.333 --> 22:06.033
just because it paid well?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.133
Yes, and I would encourage you
to moonlight.

22:09.367 --> 22:12.400
Ma, I quit because
I wasn't reaching the students.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.333
I wasn't getting through.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.066
I'm going back to high school.

22:16.133 --> 22:17.934
Look at this remote control.

22:19.533 --> 22:22.000
Feel the heft.

22:22.066 --> 22:24.233
Feel the power.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.567
I think I could start the car
with this thing.

22:28.233 --> 22:30.200
Ma, my mind is made up.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.734
Whatever makes you happy,
pussycat.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.333
Thanks, Ma.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.100
I'm sorry, but you'll have
to send back the TV.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.533
Not if I could pay for it myself.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.567
How do you propose to do that?

22:44.100 --> 22:46.734
I have the negatives
from Rose's photo shoot.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.166
It doesn't say much
for this great land of ours,

22:50.233 --> 22:52.700
but there's a market out there.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.166
You know, Mrs. Petrillo,

23:00.233 --> 23:04.600
I've never had a woman your age
do a Boudoir photograph.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.834
Yeah, well, I want
a good one for the obit.

23:13.533 --> 23:16.100
Ok. Show me what you got.
