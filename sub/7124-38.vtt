00:31.073 --> 00:32.701
There goes, there goes!

00:32.807 --> 00:34.083
You peep it, bro?

00:34.177 --> 00:35.415
Yonder goes!

00:36.898 --> 00:38.465
Glob's helmet coming in fast!

00:38.627 --> 00:40.456
Yo, I'm zoomed in too far.

00:40.556 --> 00:41.924
Making me sick.

00:43.858 --> 00:44.858
See it?

00:45.580 --> 00:46.658
Sees it!

00:48.496 --> 00:50.603
Whoa, good thing it sprinkled
this morning, right?

00:50.734 --> 00:52.726
This tall, wet grass
feels good on my legs.

00:52.822 --> 00:54.400
Huh, what?
Who's that?

00:54.468 --> 00:55.549
I don't know.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.642
It looks like we should've
skipped brunch.

00:57.915 --> 01:01.353
Early bird got the worm, and
then the worm was <i> his</i> brunch.

01:01.421 --> 01:02.462
Our brunch was sick.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.541
Right.

01:03.609 --> 01:06.344
Now we got the calorie
fuel to jump this fool.

01:06.574 --> 01:08.173
Oh, my truth, dude!

01:08.241 --> 01:09.322
Is that Betty?

01:09.432 --> 01:10.432
Betty's dead.

01:10.676 --> 01:12.564
Disappeared doesn't
always mean dead.

01:12.785 --> 01:14.033
Eh, you're right.

01:14.101 --> 01:15.173
She looks alive.

01:15.262 --> 01:17.045
Alive and off the grid,

01:17.154 --> 01:19.228
snatching up
glob remnants.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.806
I got a weird feeling
in my fat basket.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.621
Like, what does she want
with glob's helmet,

01:23.689 --> 01:25.066
and why has she got
new glasses on?

01:25.212 --> 01:27.072
What do <i> we</i> want
with glob's helmet?

01:27.146 --> 01:28.666
Dude, we're scavengers.

01:28.734 --> 01:30.205
Is that what we are?

01:30.888 --> 01:32.908
Okay, stealth mode.

01:41.015 --> 01:42.343
Oh, no, man!

01:42.411 --> 01:43.984
Magic man's house!

01:44.052 --> 01:46.546
Likely, he's got betty under
a mind-control spell!

01:46.632 --> 01:48.695
Shoot, man, I don't want
to deal with this guy.

01:48.763 --> 01:50.327
He's a tough adversary,

01:50.395 --> 01:53.671
but if we hide in the trees,
pinpoint his location,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.468
maybe you can sever
his spine before

01:55.554 --> 01:57.015
he can do his
magic on us.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.148
Good plan!

01:58.216 --> 01:59.906
Get the spine! Whoa!

01:59.974 --> 02:00.999
Whoa!

02:01.067 --> 02:02.072
Babies!

02:02.140 --> 02:03.255
Ohh!

02:03.323 --> 02:04.523
There goes!

02:04.591 --> 02:05.832
Shh, shh!

02:05.900 --> 02:06.939
Peace.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.758
Like a red,
raw trash hatch.

02:12.150 --> 02:13.528
You're in luck!

02:13.684 --> 02:14.714
Come on!

02:14.782 --> 02:16.484
You get to rule
over my house

02:16.552 --> 02:20.114
while I'm gone for the rest of
forever right here on my shelf

02:20.200 --> 02:23.544
of special friends,
Margles and tiny manticore.

02:23.635 --> 02:25.887
You promised me
<i>I</i> would rule!

02:26.028 --> 02:28.426
How can a coward
rule the roost?

02:28.494 --> 02:30.973
You escaped once
and came right back.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.098
How sad is that, huh?

02:33.181 --> 02:36.516
You gave me some kind
of hostage syndrome!

02:36.584 --> 02:38.637
I need therapy!

02:38.738 --> 02:41.163
Well, Finn and
Jake are heroes,

02:41.231 --> 02:43.129
so try being more like them,
why don't you?

02:43.197 --> 02:44.395
Peace!

02:44.589 --> 02:46.027
Finn and Jake?!

02:46.132 --> 02:47.332
What did you do?!

02:47.401 --> 02:48.785
You monster!

02:49.732 --> 02:52.391
I would do
something if I could!

02:52.577 --> 02:53.988
You hear me,
magic man?!

02:54.064 --> 02:55.108
You hear me?!

02:55.176 --> 02:56.184
What's all that yelling?

02:56.252 --> 02:58.024
Little guy's sad
to see me go.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.785
Well, there it is... what
remains of your brother, glob.

03:00.853 --> 03:02.812
♪ What remains? ♪

03:02.880 --> 03:05.613
♪ Tell me what remains ♪

03:05.681 --> 03:10.137
♪ some loser smashed
out your brains ♪

03:10.365 --> 03:11.556
End of song.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.646
So, this thing's really gonna
transmute you into the new glob?

03:14.801 --> 03:17.150
Of course,
and then I'm gonna

03:17.230 --> 03:19.765
make it rain on
mars in a bad way.

03:19.918 --> 03:21.950
Fire up those
ovens, honey!

03:22.115 --> 03:23.567
This is exciting!

03:23.668 --> 03:25.404
A little sad
though, right?

03:25.481 --> 03:26.553
Which part?

03:26.621 --> 03:28.692
Your brother blowing
up in space.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.254
Doesn't that
mess you up?

03:30.365 --> 03:32.028
Nothing messes <i> me</i> up.

03:32.293 --> 03:33.512
I don't believe that.

03:33.668 --> 03:34.944
Like, who is Margles,

03:35.012 --> 03:37.082
and why is there a picture
of her on your shelf?

03:37.152 --> 03:39.038
Something there connects to
who <i> you</i> are

03:39.106 --> 03:40.403
and your magic.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.879
Someone shines a light into my
dark-wizard matter,

03:43.996 --> 03:47.126
a way to unclose
the circuit of magic...

03:47.223 --> 03:48.512
Madness...

03:48.704 --> 03:50.364
And sadness.

03:50.435 --> 03:51.493
That's right.

03:51.617 --> 03:54.200
M.M.S. runs through
<i>all</i> magic users.

03:54.285 --> 03:55.996
I hung out with
scores of them,

03:56.145 --> 03:58.723
all displaying varying
degrees of magic...

03:58.910 --> 04:00.001
Madness...

04:00.176 --> 04:01.798
And sadness.

04:01.926 --> 04:04.811
Studying these symptoms could
lead me to their underlying

04:04.879 --> 04:06.694
cause, and then
I'll control the

04:06.762 --> 04:09.121
forces that hold
sway over Simon.

04:09.236 --> 04:10.350
I see.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.530
You see what?

04:11.598 --> 04:13.499
The coconut crab
who swims in

04:13.567 --> 04:15.187
your neighbor's
pool at night.

04:15.278 --> 04:17.346
Maybe Simon's
in there, too.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.992
Who <i> else</i> holds their
breath in there, betty?

04:20.069 --> 04:23.496
All magic users swim
in the loomy gloom.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.176
Finn and Jake,
if you can hear me, listen!

04:26.270 --> 04:27.889
There's a
lady downstairs.

04:27.957 --> 04:29.796
She thinks she can
save her B .F., Simon,

04:29.864 --> 04:31.467
by finding the
source of magic,

04:31.535 --> 04:33.840
but she ain't gonna
find Jack squat!

04:33.996 --> 04:35.817
Magic man's using her!

04:36.184 --> 04:38.864
He's gonna make her a talking
skateboard or something stupid

04:38.981 --> 04:40.046
like that.

04:40.114 --> 04:43.749
I can't help because I'm
psychologically powerless!

04:43.833 --> 04:46.952
But you are heroes,
and I believe in you!

04:47.075 --> 04:48.921
I believe!
You hear me?!

04:48.998 --> 04:50.145
Please!

04:50.247 --> 04:53.149
Go Jake or... Finn!

04:53.262 --> 04:55.127
Which ever! Save her!

04:55.286 --> 04:56.853
Wait! No!

04:56.958 --> 04:58.333
Oh, glob, I'm sorry!

04:58.424 --> 04:59.952
I didn't plan this out!

05:02.044 --> 05:03.186
Whew!

05:03.277 --> 05:04.602
Good pump!

05:04.780 --> 05:06.389
Fire's ablaze!

05:06.530 --> 05:09.173
Pump to failure...
That's what weightlifters say.

05:09.241 --> 05:10.610
So, what happens now?

05:10.678 --> 05:13.227
We sweat it out in a
magic-induced trance.

05:13.295 --> 05:16.665
My essence marinates glob's
helmet with its ancient human

05:16.733 --> 05:18.452
DNA code,
which should cause it

05:18.520 --> 05:19.813
to act as a
sorcerer's stone for

05:19.881 --> 05:22.108
your transmutation
into the globhead.

05:22.319 --> 05:24.178
Which should allow
<i>me</i> to activate

05:24.246 --> 05:26.116
my ancient
martian transport.

05:26.303 --> 05:27.725
Is this gonna change you?

05:27.842 --> 05:29.311
Will it change <i> you?</i>

05:29.413 --> 05:31.428
And will you
be hungry after?

05:31.553 --> 05:34.452
Why don't you finish baking
your famous bread, huh?

05:34.561 --> 05:36.202
This is your last chance!

05:36.295 --> 05:38.123
The dirt should
break your fall,

05:38.256 --> 05:39.972
then it's up to you
'cause I'm useless.

05:40.095 --> 05:41.171
Go!

05:41.239 --> 05:42.373
Yes!

05:42.608 --> 05:43.686
Ah, ha! Do it!

05:43.754 --> 05:45.616
Bread's going...

05:46.319 --> 05:47.686
In.

05:48.905 --> 05:50.149
Hurry up, betty.

05:50.217 --> 05:54.069
All the answers to your
theories as our spirits meld.

05:56.444 --> 05:58.155
Okay, be right there!

05:59.259 --> 06:00.756
It's gonna get sweaty?

06:00.850 --> 06:02.889
The more skin mist,
the better.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.227
So, you're not afraid of
what I might see in you?

06:05.295 --> 06:06.720
No, dumb-dumb.

06:06.788 --> 06:09.391
You imagined the
lock before the key.

06:09.459 --> 06:12.608
You think this is the key,
but it's a waste basket.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.350
Flumes open!

06:17.767 --> 06:18.791
We'll see.

06:18.859 --> 06:21.843
Smooth and gray as
far as you can see.

06:21.968 --> 06:23.648
No life grows in me.

06:23.804 --> 06:24.929
Nothing to weed.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.429
Nothing to seed.

06:26.515 --> 06:28.179
Pure and perfect.

06:28.398 --> 06:30.737
Like the marble
floors of a bank.

06:30.814 --> 06:34.641
You slide with no obstacles,
forever blank.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.400
Whoa.

06:37.611 --> 06:39.726
It really <i> is</i> like he said.

06:40.078 --> 06:42.515
Sort of cool, though.

06:44.923 --> 06:46.577
The key.

06:50.691 --> 06:51.827
Whoa.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.564
Aha!

06:55.719 --> 06:56.719
Bingo!

06:56.882 --> 06:59.257
Oh, ho, ho, whoa!

07:02.536 --> 07:03.694
Margles?

07:04.238 --> 07:05.772
Open your eyes, Margles.

07:05.849 --> 07:07.009
Who's that?

07:07.077 --> 07:10.132
I'm magic man, and that's my
sibling, glob.

07:10.202 --> 07:11.235
Hi.

07:11.312 --> 07:12.897
Uh, could I
talk to you a sec?

07:12.968 --> 07:14.271
Okay. What's up?

07:14.804 --> 07:17.335
That's our new planetary
defense system?

07:17.460 --> 07:18.618
Yeah, Margles.

07:18.686 --> 07:20.420
Margles is your wife, dude.

07:20.538 --> 07:22.722
My wife was taken by golb.

07:24.952 --> 07:26.350
This is like my tribute.

07:26.811 --> 07:29.366
I'm gonna install her right
there on olympus mons so

07:29.434 --> 07:31.179
she can protect
us from golb.

07:31.265 --> 07:33.694
But you named her
after your wife.

07:33.796 --> 07:35.546
Yeah, but it stands for

07:35.640 --> 07:39.702
"magical automated resistance
generating laser energy supplier."

07:39.785 --> 07:40.798
Come again?

07:40.866 --> 07:42.942
Whatever I wanted to
call her Margles.

07:43.019 --> 07:45.298
So, you used
magic to make her,

07:45.366 --> 07:48.108
and you don't think your
feelings for your lost wife

07:48.233 --> 07:50.950
might have compromised
your spell programming?

07:51.027 --> 07:52.884
No, that's crazy.

07:52.952 --> 07:55.361
Her appearance is just
a <i> symbol</i> of Margles

07:55.429 --> 07:58.491
Why do I feel like this
is the worst idea ever?

07:58.679 --> 08:01.267
What a great idea
going on this hike.

08:01.335 --> 08:02.780
Why didn't you magic us up?

08:02.882 --> 08:06.931
Uh, I guess I wanted to know
more about you since I created

08:06.999 --> 08:08.515
you in a deep trance state.

08:08.648 --> 08:12.601
All I am is in you,
so know yourself, magic man.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.507
Yeah, duh, okay.

08:14.641 --> 08:15.757
To the top then!

08:15.849 --> 08:17.173
Wa...

08:17.241 --> 08:18.568
Zaa!

08:18.645 --> 08:21.426
Okay, then, ready to
initiate the install?

08:21.493 --> 08:23.442
- Yes.
- Wait, hold on.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.184
You should come back
down.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.340
I got to stop the
second coming of golb.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.085
Uh, he's probably
not coming back.

08:30.153 --> 08:31.343
Iwish he <i> would.</i>

08:31.411 --> 08:33.895
Maybe I would see <i> you</i> again...
original you.

08:34.028 --> 08:35.739
I looked everywhere,
you know.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.807
So what?

08:36.886 --> 08:39.129
Every dimension,
every dead world.

08:39.239 --> 08:41.965
I even wished you back
in prismo's time room.

08:43.541 --> 08:46.643
Balls, man, that has
never happened before.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.801
But you were gone, erased,
only existing here...

08:50.967 --> 08:52.192
And <i> here.</i>

08:52.387 --> 08:53.499
For hundreds of years,

08:53.567 --> 08:57.107
I held that sadness until my
magic and science were strong

08:57.184 --> 08:59.519
enough to create you
from my nightmares.

08:59.634 --> 09:01.792
Then let me do what
you built me for.

09:03.329 --> 09:04.762
I take it back!

09:04.934 --> 09:06.786
Aah!

09:10.889 --> 09:12.569
Don't activate, Margles!

09:12.637 --> 09:15.223
You came from <i> me,</i>
so you got to understand!

09:15.324 --> 09:16.582
I came from...

09:16.715 --> 09:18.832
Your nightmares!

09:24.837 --> 09:25.954
Unh!

09:30.792 --> 09:31.811
Ohh!

09:32.331 --> 09:33.410
Unh!

09:34.892 --> 09:35.892
Unh!

09:40.594 --> 09:41.862
Oomph!

09:44.812 --> 09:46.569
Wait, what's happening?!

09:46.848 --> 09:48.132
Aah!

09:52.809 --> 09:54.757
Ohhhh! What the...

09:54.882 --> 09:57.095
Oh, look, the bread's alive.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.257
Betty, you see?!

09:58.343 --> 10:01.914
I see a crab emerging
from a dark pool.

10:02.062 --> 10:03.585
Oh, yeah?

10:04.184 --> 10:06.616
W-What does the crab say?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.825
Aaaaah!

10:15.562 --> 10:17.062
Laters!

10:20.641 --> 10:21.732
Wow!

10:21.935 --> 10:24.537
My sadness is gone, and my...

10:24.614 --> 10:25.659
Ow!

10:25.727 --> 10:26.852
Hey!

10:26.938 --> 10:28.665
Murm, muph, maph.

10:28.803 --> 10:29.852
Do what?

10:29.931 --> 10:31.001
Murm, muph, maph.

10:31.078 --> 10:32.352
Turn you back?

10:32.420 --> 10:33.464
Meph!

10:33.532 --> 10:34.542
I can't.

10:34.610 --> 10:36.727
I think I'm just
a normie now.

10:36.829 --> 10:38.610
Maybe someone in
wizard city can help.

10:38.678 --> 10:40.462
- Ow!
- Maph, moh.

10:40.530 --> 10:41.907
Ow!

10:45.459 --> 10:48.454
Finn, is that you and Jake?

10:48.522 --> 10:49.703
My, muh, mu, mimuh,

10:49.771 --> 10:50.597
mimuh.

10:50.665 --> 10:52.198
Fly you to wizard city?

10:52.275 --> 10:53.759
I can't!

10:53.860 --> 10:54.995
Meh, moo, mam!

10:55.063 --> 10:57.009
Moo, mah, mu, uh!

11:00.567 --> 11:01.801
Thank you, heroes!

11:01.918 --> 11:03.973
You helped me
find my courage!

11:04.141 --> 11:06.188
Mih, muh,
mim, mo, muh.

11:06.705 --> 11:08.391
What do normies <i> do?</i>

11:08.487 --> 11:10.619
Get smoothies
or something?
