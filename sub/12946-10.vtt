WEBVTT

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
GRANDDAD:

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Mmm.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Riley, get the door.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Granddad, is this the broccoli
I bought at the store today?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Yep, I cooked it
up for you.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, you cooked it
with the ham!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's pork-flavored broccoli.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Granddad, there's more pork
in the pork-flavored broccoli

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
than there is broccoli.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We talked about this.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Vegetables cooked with pork...
counts as pork.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
TOM:
Hey.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Do I smell
pork-flavored broccoli?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey, everyone. Mwah.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I brought peach cobbler.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Ewwww.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Miss Dubois,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
your peach cobbler
look like throw up.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
It do! Look!

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It look like throw up
with peas in it.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Miss Dubois,
you been eatin' peas?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Boy, what is
wrong with you?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with her?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
She the one who brought vomit

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
over here in
a Tupperware container.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That is not vomit!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It just look like vomit.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Now apologize
to Miss Dubois.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Um, i-it-- It's okay.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Really.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Miss Dubois, I'm sorry

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
your peach cobbler
look like vomit with peas.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Damn it, boy!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Guys, please.
We don't have to--

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't care
if you beat me, Granddad.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I won't eat it!

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
That is disgustin'!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's completely
uncalled for!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
GRANDDAD: You'll eat it

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
if I have to shove it
down your throat!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Really, I didn't mean
for it to be--

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I-I know what
you tryin' to do!

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
You tryin' to kill me!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I hate you!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You are gonna eat
that cobbler!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
And you're gonna act
like you like it!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
RILEY:
I don't wanna eat

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
the cobbler!

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Best meal I've had
in years, Robert.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
What's this called?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I call it Granddad's
pork swine delight.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
It consists of two pig knuckles
glazed in honey.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Pig tongue marinated
in butter for two days.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Chitlins--

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
That's pig intestines

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
for y'all that don't know.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
--soaked in hot sauce,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
drizzled with mayonnaise,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
and then set to harden

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
on my back porch

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
in 3 pounds of cheddar cheese.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Mommy?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm sleepy.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, don't worry about that,
little baby.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's just "the itis."

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
The what?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
The itis.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That's what you call it

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
when you get sleepy
after a big meal.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
The itis?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
You know, Robert,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I own a little health food spot
near Meadowlark Park.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Great location,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
but the food tastes like
hot armpit on wheat bread.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I've been thinking
about making a change.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
You interested?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
My own restaurant.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Mm-hm.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Uh...

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
That's a great idea, Robert.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You know what's even
a better idea is

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
a lounge singer.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I sing, Robert.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I could...

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I could sing to the people
while they--

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
RILEY:
It should have beds

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
instead of tables--

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
--so after people eat,

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
they could just pass out.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Good idea.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
We should get together
tomorrow and talk.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
My own r-restra...

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Huey, you handle the dishes.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
WUNCLER:
I'm telling you, Robert,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
this is the best location
in Woodcrest.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I own all the businesses
on this block.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Everything except
Meadowlark Memorial Park.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I've been trying to buy
that park for years,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
but the state is trying
to buttfuck me on the price.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
But we'll see
who buttfucks who.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Wow.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I didn't know
Meadowlark Lemon died.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Who's Meadowlark Lemon?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I found that the whole
health-food thing

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
attracts the wrong kind
of crowd.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Hello, Mr. Wuncler.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Hello.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Cutie pie, hello.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Excuse me, gentlemen.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Would you like to sign
our petition to get

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
more humane treatment
for immigrant workers?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
If you don't get
that bullshit

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
out of my face, bitch...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Chico, take an order.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Ah,  sí, señor.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Seventeen pigs,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
75 pounds of butter,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
one and a half tons
of grease.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Sound like a good start?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Mm-hm.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I need to be thinking urban.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
More Negro.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The black thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
That's what's happening
now with the kids.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Mm-hm.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Eh.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Everyone,
listen up.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I'd like to introduce you
to my new partner,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Robert Free-man.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
We're going to be opening
a soul-food restaurant together.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
MAN: Hey, all right.
MAN 2: Oh, soul food!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay, so...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
you...are all fired.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
ALL:
Ooh.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
WUNCLER:
Everyone else,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I hate your kind.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Never come back.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Congratulations, Robert.
This is gonna be great.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Uh,  Señor  Wuncler.
Are we fired too?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Not the Mexicans.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm half Mexican.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
WUNCLER:
Not the illegal Mexicans.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
ILLEGAL MEXICANS: ¡Olé!

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
GRANDDAD:
Mm-hm.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Mm-hm.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I present to you
"The Luther."

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
A full-pound burger patty
covered in cheese,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
grilled onion,
five strips of bacon,

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
all sandwiched between--

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Two doughnuts!

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Two Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's called the Luther

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
because it was supposed
to have been invented

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
by Mr. Luther Vandross himself.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Luther Vandross
is dead.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
And? What's your point?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Hm?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Is this one
of your menus?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Sausage and waffle
and fried chicken

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
breakfast lasagna?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yep.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Bacon-wrapped
chitlin-stuffed catfish?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad, you can't serve
this kind of food to people.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It'll cause...death.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Whoa.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This is what crack
must feel like.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Shame on you, Huey.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Move out to the suburbs,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
and suddenly you too good
for soul food.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Perhaps you would enjoy
a spot of cheese

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and a buttered scone,
white boy.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Boy? Boy, are you okay?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm sure it's
just the itis, right?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That or insulin shock.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Do CPR.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Riley, wake up!

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, I'm not sure
yellin' at him

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
is gonna help, Granddad.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
How do you not know CPR?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I tried to learn CPR,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
but they wouldn't let me.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
'Cause I was black.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
What?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Nowadays, y'all run around
and learn CPR

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
whenever y'all want to.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Just go around
savin' lives,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
resuscitatin' each other
willy-nilly.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
But when I was a young man,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
it used to be against the law

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
to teach colored folks CPR,
okay?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Man, that's not true!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
is that you?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh, boy,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I thought we lost you
there for a second.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
How was the Luther?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Best...thing...ever.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Sounds like an endorsement
to me.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Now, look at y'all.
Just purty as a couple can be.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
How many in your party?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Just us.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And how long of a nap

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
will you be takin'?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, we were thinking
maybe 45 minutes.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
That's just great.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Head on in.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
MAN:
Tonight is pork-produced sushi.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Hold on to your wasabi

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
as we take you
to a super-exclusive

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
grand opening of The Itis!

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
A new place to see
or be seen in Woodcrest.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
With the maître d'

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
who might be causing
all the ruckus,

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Uncle Ruckus.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
En français,  my good man.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
That's Uncle "Rue-kue."

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It's French.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm part French
and Cherokee Indian,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
with just a splish-splash
of Irish.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I-I know Irish.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Sometimes I drink Hennessy,
and I make booty calls!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
All right, Rue-Kue.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What's Robert Freeman's secret?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, let me just say
this here.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
If there's one thing that
a colored man is good at,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
it's cookin' a pig.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
There you have it--

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That ain't to say
a white man

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
couldn't cook a pig better.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
His big brain just focused
on more important things,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
like runnin' the world
and spaceships.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
oh, you're such
a wonderful crowd.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
My name is Tommy D,
hip-hop lounge singer,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
and I'll be providing

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
your listening pleasure
this evening.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And right now,
I'd like to slow it on down

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
with my main man, Biz Markie.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
With your mouth, Biz

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
With your mouth, Biz

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
HUEY:
Excuse me, brother.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Mind if I have a word
with you

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
about some of the so-called

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
"food" you're servin'
this evenin'?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
TOM:

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And here's the man himself.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Robert, these two ladies
wanted to meet

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
the man behind The Itis.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Well!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Hello there, cutie pie.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Hi.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
My name is Janet,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and I just can't begin
to tell you

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
how fantastic your food is.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
GRANDDAD:
Oh.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Thank you, kindly.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
With your...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Biz.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Listen, I don't want
to keep you,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
but I'm sure that you will be
seeing a lot more of me.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Bitches love free food,
Robert.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
MAN:
Oh, my God!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, where you goin'?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Bed four needs more bacon.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What did you tell him?
What's behind your back?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Elijah Muhammad's
"How to Eat to Live."

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I knew it!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Just what joy do you get

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
out of trying to crush
all of my dreams, Huey?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Do you know how long
I've wanted

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
to own my own restaurant?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Three weeks, at Sunday dinner.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That was the first time
you mentioned it,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
and you only started doin'
the stupid Sunday dinner thing

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
because you saw Soul Food  on cable.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
HUEY: We're gonna pause this

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
for the benefit of all y'all who never saw  Soul Food.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Soul Food  is a movie

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
about a big, humongous black grandmother,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
aptly named Big Mama.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Big Mama demonstrates her love

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
by feeding herself and her offspring

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
enormous amounts of pig lard.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Then--

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Get this.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
--Big Mama's arteries are so clogged,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
they gotta amputate her arm.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
GRANDDAD: It was her leg!

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
HUEY: Right. Okay, whatever. Leg.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Then she dies of a heart attack.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Or another stroke or somethin'.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
MAN:
God called her home.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: And what does the family do

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
after she dies?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
They get together for a Sunday dinner

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and eat the same food that just killed Big Mama.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
The same food!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
They didn't learn a lesson. Nobody went on a diet.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And that's the end of the movie.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Sunday dinners was my idea.
They got that from me.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Something wrong?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Look, Ed,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm sorry.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
We just lost a waiter,
a-and...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Robert, relax.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Look around.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, I still have
to replace that waiter.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Ugh.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Wha--

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
HUEY: What people soon discovered

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
was that Granddad's food was as addictive as it was tasty.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
The restaurant was booked solid around the clock.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
People started to show up late for work.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Others stopped going to work altogether.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Jobs were lost.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
The Itis addicts who couldn't afford the beds

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
moved into Meadowlark Park.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Without jobs,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
they turned to crime to feed their habit.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
A month after The Itis opened,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Meadowlark Park had its first mugging.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
No, no!

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Stop! Stop!
Give me that!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Hello?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
911?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I've been mugged!

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
It took 3 hours for the police to arrive.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
This was officially a bad neighborhood.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Ow!

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
You bitch!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh, you--

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Stay away
from my food!

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
GRANDDAD:
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Don't damage
the floor!

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
WOMAN:
Hey, Granddaddy,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
it's me,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Hey!
Janet.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
We met on opening night.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Damn!

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
What happened to you?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Look, I was just wondering

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
if I could get
a quick Luther burger.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Hey, come on, get off me!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Please.
Look, just one.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
What's wrong
with you, woman?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Hey, get off my leg!

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You got one in that bag,
don't you?!

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Please, Granddaddy.
I'll do anything!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Then take the damn thing!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
GRANDDAD:
Damn!

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
That was my dinner.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Don't worry
about last night.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
We'll get you
some security.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
This ain't exactly

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the best neighborhood
anymore,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
but we have
a bigger problem.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We're losing money
because you're not getting

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
these people out of here
fast enough.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Like him.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Get your ass up,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
or pay for another hour
in the bed! Now!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I can't...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Chico!

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Oh, God.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
There.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Look like a bed
just opened up.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Check this out.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I had Chico modify the bed

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
like the Mexicans do
with their cars.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They call it...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
"hydraulics."

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Watch this.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Let's see.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Um, this is
my first time here,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
but all my friends
rave about it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What's good?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, everything here
will kill you.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Run.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Fine.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
You wanna
keep playin' around?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Now, you can wash
the dishes.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Granddad, look what you've
done to this community.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's not that bad.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Not that bad?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
This place used to sit

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
between a coffee shop
and a day spa.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Now, there's a liquor store
and a damn Foot Locker.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
This food is destructive.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
This food is your culture.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Then the culture is destructive.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
CHICO:
He's right,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Señor  Freeman.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
All African-American slaves
had to eat

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
was the parts of the pigs

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
the slaves' masters
wouldn't eat,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
but that was
a survival technique,  ese.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
They didn't really have
a choice.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't think people are
supposed to eat this stuff.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Or, at least, not so much.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
What?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I can't take
an Afro-American Studies class

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
at the community college?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Well, nobody asked you, Chico.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This is my restaurant,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and we'll serve the food
that I wanna serve,  señor.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Actually,
it's my restaurant,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and it's shutting down.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Sorry, Robert.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It was fun while it lasted.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
But, uh, w-what happened?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
HUEY: Granddad learned white people

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
had their own survival techniques.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
They call it "litigation."

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Janet O'Siren had gone from this,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
to this...

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
and back to this,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
with the help of two liposuctions

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and emergency gastrointestinal surgery.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We want half a million
for medical bills

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
and 4 million
in emotional damages.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
We'll pay
her insurance deductible.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Deal.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
And, um-- Ahem.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
--one last Luther burger.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Chico!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Wuncler feared it would be

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
the first of many lawsuits against The Itis.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Granddad's restaurant was no more.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Mmm, mmm! Oh!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This isn't fair.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
The people liked
this restaurant,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and they liked me.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I never wanted
to hurt anybody.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Janet, are you okay?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I think she's having
a heart attack.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I believe
our business is done.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Have a nice day.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Call me later,
Robert.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Hello.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
911?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
My client's having
a heart attack.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
They're not gonna come.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Yes. We're on the corner
of, um, uh,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Cherry Street
and-- And Fifth.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Right across
from Meadowlark Park.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Hello?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Told you.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Don't you know CPR?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I'm a lawyer.
We don't help people.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
What about you guys?
Don't you know CPR?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
GRANDDAD:
So I told him,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
they wouldn't even teach
black people CPR

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
when I was young.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
HUEY: We still do the Sunday dinners.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I think Granddad just likes being popular.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
But we do switch up the menu from week to week.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
It's somethin'.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
So, what happened?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Chico saved her.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Eh. I took a class.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And after this meal, nobody passed out.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
If you'll excuse me.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Robert,
may I use--?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
WUNCLER:
Bathroom's upstairs, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
GRANDDAD:
Huey!

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Take care of
the dishes, okay?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Don't anybody go
in the bathroom

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
for 35 or 45 minutes.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Whew!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Open the window!
