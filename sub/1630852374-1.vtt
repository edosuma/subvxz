00:14.931 --> 00:18.068
On behalf of everyone
aboard Sundancer Airlines,

00:18.103 --> 00:20.206
welcome to Snowflake, Montana.

00:20.241 --> 00:21.793
Happy holidays.
Candy cane for you.

00:21.827 --> 00:22.827
Thanks so much.

00:22.862 --> 00:24.103
-Thank you for flying with us.
-Thank you.

00:24.137 --> 00:25.448
One for you.
Happy holidays.

00:25.482 --> 00:27.275
-Happy holidays.
-Happy holidays.

00:28.448 --> 00:31.000
I cannot believe it is just
over a week until Christmas

00:31.034 --> 00:32.689
and I still have so much to do.

00:32.724 --> 00:34.551
Well, you know what they say.

00:34.586 --> 00:35.758
If you want to get
something done,

00:35.793 --> 00:36.965
ask a busy person.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.931
Then don't be surprised

00:37.965 --> 00:39.862
if I ask you to find me
a busy person.

00:39.896 --> 00:40.931
Aw.

00:40.965 --> 00:43.000
Hey, Captain.

00:43.034 --> 00:44.896
We all heard about
the sale of the airline.

00:44.931 --> 00:46.137
Things won't be the same
around here

00:46.172 --> 00:47.310
without Sundancer.

00:47.344 --> 00:49.137
We had a good run, Colin.

00:49.172 --> 00:50.137
Don't you worry.

00:50.172 --> 00:51.827
I'm not going anywhere.

00:54.862 --> 00:57.241
It's okay, sweetheart.
Everything will be okay.

00:57.275 --> 00:59.034
First time flying?

00:59.068 --> 01:00.965
We're meeting
Lindy's grandparents in Seattle

01:01.000 --> 01:02.034
before their Christmas cruise,

01:02.068 --> 01:03.448
and Lindy's a bit nervous.

01:03.482 --> 01:07.034
Of course, we have another
flight to Helena in a few days.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.275
Hi, Lindy.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.344
I'm Captain Beckett.

01:10.310 --> 01:11.206
Can I tell you a secret?

01:13.275 --> 01:15.379
The first time
that I got on an airplane,

01:15.413 --> 01:16.655
I was scared, too.

01:16.689 --> 01:17.724
Really?

01:17.758 --> 01:18.793
Really.

01:18.827 --> 01:21.448
But there are a lot
of brave people on board

01:21.482 --> 01:23.137
to make sure everybody is safe.

01:24.172 --> 01:26.275
I think I know a way
to make you feel brave.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.034
Wow!

01:32.068 --> 01:35.379
I am appointing you
junior assistant co-pilot,

01:35.413 --> 01:37.137
in charge of anyone you see
feeling nervous.

01:37.172 --> 01:39.724
It's your job to teach them
to breathe like this.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.034
Perfect.

01:48.103 --> 01:49.206
Merry Christmas!

01:49.241 --> 01:50.241
Thank you.

01:52.137 --> 01:53.586
She was so nice.

01:56.275 --> 01:57.344
Morning, Joe.

01:57.379 --> 01:59.034
Any messages for me?

01:59.068 --> 02:00.551
Thanks.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.517
[ma Aw, this place is never
going to be the same again.

02:03.551 --> 02:04.965
So many memories.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.793
We'll make new memories, too.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.965
Just because you sold Sundancer
to Connor Airways

02:09.000 --> 02:10.724
doesn't mean
anything has to change.

02:10.758 --> 02:13.379
We'll just be flying
for a new boss.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.586
You know, back when

02:14.620 --> 02:17.655
your Grandma Nellie
launched the airline in '68,

02:17.689 --> 02:19.655
no one thought
this had any legs--

02:19.689 --> 02:21.758
or, I should say, wings.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.034
But instead,

02:23.068 --> 02:25.103
she and Mom put Sundancer
and the town of Snowflake

02:25.137 --> 02:26.310
on the map.

02:26.344 --> 02:28.344
That'll never go away
because we have a new owner.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.137
So what's he like?

02:31.172 --> 02:33.034
-Matt Hansen?
-Mm-hmm.

02:33.068 --> 02:34.655
Connor Airlines' CEO.

02:34.689 --> 02:37.241
Uh, he's a very smart guy

02:37.275 --> 02:38.241
with an incredible
head for business,

02:38.275 --> 02:39.241
as far as I can tell.

02:39.275 --> 02:40.275
But, Dad,

02:40.310 --> 02:42.068
what's he like personally?

02:42.103 --> 02:43.896
If I have any hope
of working with the guy,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.000
I'd like to know who he is.

02:45.034 --> 02:48.137
Well, I found him
a little stiff,

02:48.172 --> 02:49.827
maybe a little hard to read,

02:49.862 --> 02:50.931
but you know what?

02:50.965 --> 02:52.310
I could have caught him
on a bad day.

02:54.413 --> 02:55.827
Hey, sis.
Who are we talking about?

02:55.862 --> 02:57.034
Matt Hansen.

02:57.068 --> 03:01.034
Connor Airlines' CEO
is coming out for a visit.

03:01.068 --> 03:02.827
Mr. Warm and Fuzzy,
Party of None?

03:02.862 --> 03:04.551
I hear he's so tightly wound

03:04.586 --> 03:06.206
that he wears
three-piece pajamas to bed.

03:06.241 --> 03:07.931
He's just flying in

03:07.965 --> 03:09.793
to see how we do things
first-hand.

03:09.827 --> 03:11.344
Oh, so we should all be
on our best behavior.

03:11.379 --> 03:13.965
Oh, then you might want
to clean up your cluttered desk

03:14.000 --> 03:15.482
so that
his first impression of you

03:15.517 --> 03:17.482
isn't that you're scattered
and disorganized.

03:17.517 --> 03:18.793
Me?

03:18.827 --> 03:21.275
Sundancer Airlines'
marketing genius?

03:21.310 --> 03:23.103
Oh, and has the genius

03:23.137 --> 03:25.000
finally finished designing

03:25.034 --> 03:27.241
the loyalty program
for our frequent flyers?

03:31.068 --> 03:32.482
♪ Dashing through the snow

03:32.517 --> 03:34.310
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh

03:34.344 --> 03:35.965
♪ O'er the fields we go

03:36.000 --> 03:37.068
♪ Laughing all the way

03:37.103 --> 03:38.586
♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha...

03:38.620 --> 03:40.551
Nothing seems
to faze that boy.

03:40.586 --> 03:41.620
Tell me about it.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.206
How is it that I inherited
your worry gene

03:44.241 --> 03:46.620
and he got Mom's
happy-go-lucky nature?

03:47.689 --> 03:48.655
And what about you, sweetie?

03:48.689 --> 03:50.448
When are you going
to find someone special?

03:50.482 --> 03:52.137
It's been five years
since your divorce.

03:52.172 --> 03:54.793
Dad, we have been through this.

03:54.827 --> 03:58.965
I'm just not ready to dip my toe
back in the dating pond.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.379
Not ready,
or maybe not willing?

04:03.758 --> 04:05.551
Look, I'm sorry, Jenny.

04:05.586 --> 04:06.931
I know it's none of my business.

04:06.965 --> 04:10.448
I just think that you deserve
to find your happily ever after.

04:10.482 --> 04:12.413
I am happy.

04:12.448 --> 04:13.827
And you worry too much.

04:18.413 --> 04:19.586
Thanks to everyone at Sundancer,

04:19.620 --> 04:20.724
it looks like we'll be able

04:20.758 --> 04:21.827
to add three more kids

04:21.862 --> 04:23.965
to this year's
Santa's Flight charity event.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.655
'Tis the season
to be generous, right?

04:25.689 --> 04:27.241
Mm-hmm.

04:27.275 --> 04:28.241
Wow!

04:28.275 --> 04:30.275
You didn't tell me
he was such a looker.

04:31.275 --> 04:32.793
-Who?
-Matt Hansen.

04:33.931 --> 04:35.310
He was just profiled
in NW Media.

04:35.344 --> 04:36.448
They ranked him third

04:36.482 --> 04:38.413
of the most successful CEOs
under 40.

04:38.448 --> 04:39.965
What else
does it say about him?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.310
Um...

04:41.344 --> 04:42.137
hmm...

04:42.172 --> 04:43.379
dee-dee-dee-dee-doo...

04:43.413 --> 04:45.620
Oh! He made his mark
in mergers and acquisitions

04:45.655 --> 04:46.620
and has a knack

04:46.655 --> 04:48.482
for turning struggling airlines
profitable

04:48.517 --> 04:50.793
by cutting out the fat.

04:50.827 --> 04:51.758
Great.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.137
So he's a numbers guy?

04:54.172 --> 04:55.344
Am I going to lose my job?

04:55.379 --> 04:56.896
Because I really love
working here.

04:56.931 --> 04:58.482
No, of course not.

04:58.517 --> 04:59.448
Why would you even say that?

04:59.482 --> 05:01.448
Well, come on, Jenny.

05:01.482 --> 05:02.862
A new owner
is all about change.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.034
Like it or not,

05:04.068 --> 05:05.275
all our jobs
may be up in the air.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.275
Yeah, well,

05:06.310 --> 05:08.965
I plan to stay on
as head of operations,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.103
so all changes
will have to go through me.

05:11.137 --> 05:12.551
Now let's get back
to Santa's Flight.

05:12.586 --> 05:13.551
Hey, sis.

05:13.586 --> 05:15.344
Hey, Megan.

05:19.103 --> 05:20.689
What, no kiss?

05:20.724 --> 05:22.172
Since when did you two get shy

05:22.206 --> 05:23.896
about public displays
of affection?

05:23.931 --> 05:25.724
Oh, uh...

05:25.758 --> 05:26.965
we're just a little nervous

05:27.000 --> 05:29.275
about the new owner's
rules on employees dating.

05:29.310 --> 05:30.448
What?

05:30.482 --> 05:31.931
You guys have been together
for almost three years.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.241
It will be fine.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.310
Oh, I'll get it.

05:41.448 --> 05:42.413
Yep.

05:45.896 --> 05:47.068
Hi.

05:55.517 --> 05:57.482
Is this where we wait
for visitor parking?

05:57.517 --> 05:59.137
Uh, yeah.

05:59.172 --> 06:01.724
Car rental, employee parking,
visitor parking.

06:01.758 --> 06:03.310
Thanks.

06:12.965 --> 06:14.482
Welcome to Snowflake.

06:17.862 --> 06:19.620
Yes. Yes, I just landed.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.068
Evening, Sam.

06:22.103 --> 06:24.310
I'm staying
at the Snowflake Inn.

06:25.206 --> 06:28.931
So in case this town has
shoddy cell service--

06:28.965 --> 06:30.034
Excuse me.

06:30.068 --> 06:31.034
The board
can reach me directly there.

06:31.068 --> 06:32.068
Thank you.

06:34.241 --> 06:35.206
Whoops!

06:35.241 --> 06:36.758
Slow your roll, pal.

06:36.793 --> 06:37.965
Or at least buy me dinner first.

06:40.965 --> 06:41.965
Excuse me.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.620
I was kidding.

06:52.793 --> 06:53.689
It seems like I'm still

06:53.724 --> 06:55.241
getting my feet
back on the ground.

06:56.655 --> 06:57.586
Hmm.

07:07.517 --> 07:08.517
Did you fly Sundancer Airlines?

07:10.241 --> 07:12.000
Private charter, actually.

07:13.758 --> 07:15.000
How nice for you.

07:16.275 --> 07:17.655
Bad for the environment, though.

07:17.689 --> 07:19.379
And all the muddy
carbon footprint

07:19.413 --> 07:21.000
you left in the sky.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.103
Next time, you should consider
Sundancer business class.

07:34.689 --> 07:36.413
Well...

07:36.448 --> 07:37.793
it seems like
this sparkly conversation

07:37.827 --> 07:39.000
has come to an end.

07:45.241 --> 07:46.206
Have a nice life.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.793
You too.

07:50.172 --> 07:51.172
Bye, Sam.

07:52.137 --> 07:53.448
All my love to your wife.

08:04.896 --> 08:07.551
Happy, happy holidays!

08:07.586 --> 08:10.275
You must be Mr. Hansen
from Connor Airlines.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.827
I'm Sue,

08:11.862 --> 08:13.206
and I'm under strict orders

08:13.241 --> 08:16.793
to put our extra-special VIP
in our finest suite.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.655
Honestly, I'm so exhausted
from the flight,

08:18.689 --> 08:19.655
any room will be fine.

08:19.689 --> 08:22.103
How does
the honeymoon suite sound?

08:22.137 --> 08:25.655
It's got a big, comfy
queen-sized bed,

08:25.689 --> 08:27.310
memory-foam mattress,

08:27.344 --> 08:28.620
expanded mini-bar,

08:28.655 --> 08:29.758
rainfall shower--

08:29.793 --> 08:30.758
I'll take it.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.034
I don't see a wedding ring,

08:38.068 --> 08:42.413
so I assume there's
no Mrs. Hansen joining you?

08:43.620 --> 08:44.586
Single?

08:44.620 --> 08:45.620
Divorced?

08:45.655 --> 08:47.137
Widower, perhaps?

08:47.172 --> 08:48.103
Oh, you poor--

08:48.137 --> 08:49.448
Sue, I'm not a widower.

08:49.482 --> 08:53.344
I'm simply a weary traveler
looking for a place to rest.

08:54.517 --> 08:55.793
Why didn't you say so?

08:57.827 --> 08:58.827
Follow me.

08:58.862 --> 09:00.448
In case you haven't noticed,

09:00.482 --> 09:04.034
we in Snowflake take the season
rather seriously around here.

09:04.068 --> 09:05.379
I'll say.

09:05.413 --> 09:08.379
Who was your last guest,
Mr. and Mrs. Claus?

09:08.413 --> 09:11.103
We pride ourselves
in making guests feel at home.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.827
It's... lovely.

09:14.862 --> 09:17.137
And that's a bakery basket
from the Beckett family.

09:17.172 --> 09:21.034
And I am sure Jenny Beckett
would love to show you around

09:21.068 --> 09:22.965
and tell you all about
Santa's Flight.

09:23.000 --> 09:23.965
Ooh!

09:28.103 --> 09:29.103
Oh!

09:40.275 --> 09:43.310
Chloe, dinner
was incredible as always.

09:43.344 --> 09:45.241
Thanks.

09:46.931 --> 09:48.413
So...

09:48.448 --> 09:49.344
have you thought any more

09:49.379 --> 09:50.413
about what colleges

09:50.448 --> 09:51.655
you plan on applying to
in the spring?

09:51.689 --> 09:54.068
Not since last night,
when you asked me at dinner.

09:54.103 --> 09:55.482
I told you, Mom.

09:55.517 --> 09:57.068
I'm just not sure
college is right for me.

09:57.103 --> 09:59.379
Hey, it doesn't mean
it's wrong for you, either.

09:59.413 --> 10:02.000
College is about
discovering who you are.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.379
Right.

10:04.413 --> 10:05.931
Oh, well, homework time.

10:12.241 --> 10:13.586
Oh, hey! Careful.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.172
Grandma's collection
is irreplaceable.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.655
-Oh!

10:18.827 --> 10:19.896
Hey, Charlie.

10:19.931 --> 10:21.310
I didn't watch Survivoryet.
No spoilers.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.034
Um, actually,

10:23.068 --> 10:24.206
I was calling
to see how you're doing.

10:24.241 --> 10:25.379
I'm fine.

10:25.413 --> 10:26.620
Why would you ask?

10:26.655 --> 10:29.034
Uh, because
you're probably sitting at home,

10:29.068 --> 10:30.034
twirling your hair right now,

10:30.068 --> 10:31.241
and I know that

10:31.275 --> 10:33.241
you only do that
when you're very anxious.

10:35.103 --> 10:36.896
It relaxes me for some reason,

10:36.931 --> 10:38.000
but I will be fine

10:38.034 --> 10:39.137
as soon as Matt Hansen

10:39.172 --> 10:40.724
flies back
to wherever he came from.

10:42.655 --> 10:43.620
Um, hey,

10:43.655 --> 10:45.103
on that train of thought,

10:45.137 --> 10:46.275
I was thinking of maybe

10:46.310 --> 10:47.896
taking Dad down to the tavern
sometime this week,

10:47.931 --> 10:48.896
cheer him up a bit?

10:48.931 --> 10:50.413
With his retirement so close,

10:50.448 --> 10:52.448
he hasn't really
been himself lately.

10:52.482 --> 10:54.000
I think the reality

10:54.034 --> 10:56.413
of the sale
of Sundancer Airlines

10:56.448 --> 10:58.413
is starting to sink in.

10:58.448 --> 10:59.379
That's great.

10:59.413 --> 11:00.448
Why don't you set something up,

11:00.482 --> 11:02.000
and bring Megan, of course.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.965
Hey.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.413
Hey, Charlie?

11:08.448 --> 11:10.586
Is something going on
between you two?

11:10.620 --> 11:12.965
You both seemed
a little distant today.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.206
Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.931
We weren't going to tell anyone
until after New Year's, though,

11:17.965 --> 11:19.724
but we broke up.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.137
What?

11:21.172 --> 11:22.896
Really?

11:22.931 --> 11:23.931
You both seemed
to be doing so well.

11:25.172 --> 11:27.068
Yeah, well,

11:27.103 --> 11:28.620
Megan was really
talking about marriage,

11:28.655 --> 11:29.965
and I'm not ready yet.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.482
And because my "yet"

11:32.517 --> 11:33.758
doesn't seem to have
an end date,

11:33.793 --> 11:34.758
we decided to split up.

11:34.793 --> 11:38.103
Charlie, you're not ready yet?

11:38.137 --> 11:39.310
She's fantastic.

11:39.344 --> 11:40.310
What are you waiting for?

11:40.344 --> 11:43.344
You have to get it toge--

11:43.379 --> 11:44.689
Okay. You know what?

11:44.724 --> 11:46.103
It is none of my business.
I'm sorry.

11:46.137 --> 11:47.724
Thank you.

11:47.758 --> 11:51.000
And hey, between you and me,
just keep this under your hat.

11:51.034 --> 11:53.068
Okay. Will do.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.310
Love you. Bye.

11:56.137 --> 11:57.413
Charlie handles our marketing,

11:57.448 --> 11:58.758
and for the past two years,

11:58.793 --> 12:00.517
my daughter, Jenny,

12:00.551 --> 12:02.827
has phased her duties
from piloting planes

12:02.862 --> 12:04.103
into management.

12:04.137 --> 12:05.379
Okay, morning, guys.

12:05.413 --> 12:07.068
I don't know if Matt Hansen
is a black-no-sugar-coffee guy

12:07.103 --> 12:08.379
or an almond-milk-latte guy,

12:08.413 --> 12:10.448
or one of those
frou-frou city snobs--

12:10.482 --> 12:11.620
Black is perfect.

12:13.758 --> 12:15.275
Wait. Aren't you the lap guy
from yesterday?

12:16.275 --> 12:17.241
-Lap guy?
-Lap guy?

12:17.275 --> 12:18.827
I thought
you were arriving this morning.

12:19.827 --> 12:21.103
I decided to fly up early.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.862
I see.

12:27.448 --> 12:28.689
Let's chat in the boardroom.

12:32.137 --> 12:33.103
Yeah!

12:34.413 --> 12:36.103
I'm here
to assess operations

12:36.137 --> 12:37.275
and identify how best

12:37.310 --> 12:39.344
to streamline
and incorporate Sundancer

12:39.379 --> 12:40.896
under the Connor Airways'
umbrella.

12:40.931 --> 12:43.862
And Matt plans
to expand Connor Airlines

12:43.896 --> 12:45.793
by beginning
flying international

12:45.827 --> 12:47.379
come the new year.

12:47.413 --> 12:48.655
Wow, international.

12:48.689 --> 12:49.620
Wow, you think big.

12:49.655 --> 12:50.965
Always.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.413
And, bit by bit,

12:52.448 --> 12:53.896
things are finally
coming together.

12:53.931 --> 12:56.241
And what exactly
does "streamline" entail?

12:56.275 --> 12:58.103
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that at this point.

12:58.137 --> 13:00.000
That's for me and
my executive team to determine.

13:00.034 --> 13:01.896
Oh, I assumed
I'd be part of the team.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.482
I'm sorry.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.689
It was always my intention

13:05.724 --> 13:09.517
that Jenny would remain on
in a management role.

13:09.551 --> 13:11.448
I mean,
given all of her experience

13:11.482 --> 13:12.724
both in the air
and on the ground,

13:12.758 --> 13:14.827
she's the perfect person
to oversee things.

13:16.068 --> 13:17.103
I see.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.241
I'm afraid I can't commit
to that at this moment.

13:19.275 --> 13:20.206
I assure you

13:20.241 --> 13:21.413
I am more than qualified
for the position.

13:21.448 --> 13:23.034
I have no doubt.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.551
However, as the new CEO,

13:24.586 --> 13:25.517
it will be my recommendation
to the board

13:25.551 --> 13:27.275
-that really matters.

13:27.310 --> 13:29.034
But I promise
to keep you in the mix.

13:30.896 --> 13:33.793
If you'll excuse me,
I have a small fire to put out.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.344
And an even bigger one
when he gets back.

13:40.379 --> 13:41.344
Keep me in the mix?

13:41.379 --> 13:43.241
He met me for two minutes.

13:43.275 --> 13:44.241
Nobody knows how things
work around Sundancer

13:44.275 --> 13:45.241
better than Jenny does.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.379
I'm sorry, sweetie.

13:46.413 --> 13:47.551
I assumed that

13:47.586 --> 13:49.758
I made my intentions very clear
with the sale.

13:49.793 --> 13:51.034
It's fine, Dad.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.379
I just have to prove to him
that I am best for the job.

13:58.793 --> 14:00.448
Oh, that was a quick fire.

14:02.206 --> 14:03.482
Yes.

14:03.517 --> 14:04.482
Would one of you be able

14:04.517 --> 14:05.586
to give me a tour
of the terminal?

14:05.620 --> 14:07.413
I thought you'd never ask.

14:09.586 --> 14:11.413
Here are just
some starter ideas.

14:11.448 --> 14:13.103
Okay.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.586
Wait, you want to cut
employee birthday parties?

14:18.620 --> 14:19.620
Unnecessary cost.

14:19.655 --> 14:20.758
And the recognition awards?

14:20.793 --> 14:21.862
Also unnecessary costs.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.758
I respectfully disagree.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.206
You can't put a price on morale.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.206
Yes, you can.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.448
You do a once-a-month
birthday cake,

14:27.482 --> 14:29.413
save on cost and calories.

14:29.448 --> 14:31.068
And you can replace
your soccer trophies

14:31.103 --> 14:32.793
with an "employee of the month"
placard.

14:32.827 --> 14:34.034
Okay, they are not
soccer trophies.

14:34.068 --> 14:35.448
They're recognition awards.

14:35.482 --> 14:36.448
Benjamin, slow down.

14:36.482 --> 14:38.241
Sorry.

14:38.275 --> 14:40.344
He has the day off of school,
and I couldn't find a sitter.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.896
Oh, Mr. Hansen,

14:41.931 --> 14:45.103
this is Hayley in maintenance,
and her son, Benjamin--

14:45.137 --> 14:46.172
or as I like to call him,

14:46.206 --> 14:48.241
our honorary Sundancer employee.

14:48.275 --> 14:49.241
Always welcome.

14:49.275 --> 14:51.103
I came to deliver
my wish to Santa.

14:51.137 --> 14:52.896
You're right on time.

14:52.931 --> 14:54.379
We were just about to make--

14:54.413 --> 14:56.931
send the list to the North Pole.

14:56.965 --> 14:58.689
Okay, Benjamin.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.655
Why don't we let the adults
get back to work,

15:00.689 --> 15:02.275
and you can go watch
the planes take off.

15:03.724 --> 15:04.827
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.241
Miss Beckett, it's just
with costs hemorrhaging,

15:08.275 --> 15:09.620
what I need in the VP role

15:09.655 --> 15:11.793
is someone who's not afraid
of making the tough decisions.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.000
I see.

15:13.034 --> 15:14.034
And what, you think

15:14.068 --> 15:15.379
because this is
a family-run business

15:15.413 --> 15:16.586
that I'm not capable?

15:16.620 --> 15:19.758
I can be cutthroat and ruthless
when I need to be.

15:21.862 --> 15:23.793
Sorry to interrupt.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.103
Jenny, I'm on
with Santa's Market,

15:25.137 --> 15:26.931
and they want to confirm
our Santa's Flight reservation.

15:26.965 --> 15:28.689
Sue mentioned something
about that at the hotel.

15:28.724 --> 15:29.689
What is that, exactly?

15:29.724 --> 15:31.379
It's our annual
Christmas tradition

15:31.413 --> 15:32.965
the airline hosts on the 23rd.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.448
We take under-served children
in the area

15:35.482 --> 15:37.103
and their families
on a fantasy trip

15:37.137 --> 15:39.379
to Santa's Market
in Idaho Falls.

15:39.413 --> 15:41.448
First, we serve
an in-flight lunch with Santa,

15:41.482 --> 15:42.689
and then, after we land,

15:42.724 --> 15:44.137
the kids spend the day
in the village,

15:44.172 --> 15:45.655
they open
their wish-list presents...

15:46.896 --> 15:48.034
Sounds nice.

15:48.068 --> 15:49.206
Sounds expensive.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.724
Well, it's worth it
once you see the kids' faces.

15:51.758 --> 15:52.758
Pure magic.

15:52.793 --> 15:53.965
I didn't see
a line item for it.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.551
Oh, um...

15:55.586 --> 15:56.793
it's under
community outreach.

15:58.482 --> 15:59.517
I'm afraid
until we can find ways

15:59.551 --> 16:00.896
to increase profit margins,

16:00.931 --> 16:02.034
we've got no choice

16:02.068 --> 16:04.206
but to put a pin in
extraneous charitable efforts.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.896
Meaning you want to ground
Santa's Flight?

16:09.827 --> 16:10.896
You're catching on quickly.

16:11.827 --> 16:13.068
Will that be a problem?

16:14.482 --> 16:15.965
You're the boss.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.448
And yes, that will be a problem.

16:30.758 --> 16:31.862
Look, I don't know what's worse.

16:31.896 --> 16:33.793
Matt's ego or his arrogance.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.551
He's walking around
like he owns the place.

16:35.586 --> 16:36.862
Well, technically, sis,
he does.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.172
I don't care
if he owns the North Pole.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.724
Santa's Flight is more important
than his precious budget.

16:41.758 --> 16:42.931
Yes, I agree,

16:42.965 --> 16:44.896
but are you sure you want
to be rocking the boat?

16:44.931 --> 16:46.620
You and Matt
are not necessarily besties.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.896
But when I didn't flinch
at canceling Santa's Flight,

16:48.931 --> 16:50.379
that seemed to impress him.

16:50.413 --> 16:51.586
Well, good.

16:51.620 --> 16:52.586
I meant to ask,

16:52.620 --> 16:53.931
what's next
to clinch the big promotion?

16:53.965 --> 16:54.965
Are you going to fire
the flight crew

16:55.000 --> 16:55.896
before Christmas?

16:55.931 --> 16:57.586
This is not about
my promotion, okay?

16:57.620 --> 16:59.000
I only agreed
to ground Santa's Flight

16:59.034 --> 17:00.310
because I had no other option.

17:00.344 --> 17:01.620
Right.
So you're not giving up?

17:01.655 --> 17:03.620
Thank you.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.862
Not even if I have to conjure up

17:04.896 --> 17:06.620
the ghost of Christmas past,
present, and future

17:06.655 --> 17:07.965
to make it happen.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.551
Well, if you're hoping
to change Matt's mind,

17:09.586 --> 17:11.482
you might be barking up
the wrong Christmas tree.

17:12.758 --> 17:14.172
You know, you're right.

17:14.206 --> 17:15.172
If we're going to do this,

17:15.206 --> 17:16.206
we're going to have to do it
ourselves.

17:16.241 --> 17:18.586
Everyone else in Snowflake
loves the event.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.724
I'd hate to see it
go by the wayside.

17:19.758 --> 17:22.655
Maybe that's it.

17:22.689 --> 17:24.827
What if we canvass
local businesses in the area

17:24.862 --> 17:26.241
to help us sponsor the event?

17:26.275 --> 17:28.965
Their donations
will help us defer costs.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.172
They can buy toys
and purchase plane tickets.

17:31.206 --> 17:32.517
Yeah, anything's possible,

17:32.551 --> 17:33.931
but we'd have to raise
a lot of money

17:33.965 --> 17:34.862
in a short amount of time.

17:34.896 --> 17:36.241
Well, failure isn't an option.

17:36.275 --> 17:37.931
Okay, okay.
I'll get the snowball rolling.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.275
You must be Matt.

17:47.310 --> 17:48.379
My mom just called

17:48.413 --> 17:49.344
to say she's on her way
to meet with you.

17:49.379 --> 17:50.448
I'm Chloe.

17:50.482 --> 17:52.275
I didn't know
her daughter worked here, too.

17:52.310 --> 17:53.551
A real family affair.

17:53.586 --> 17:55.724
I have a part-time
work-study at high school.

17:55.758 --> 17:57.896
Do you plan on getting
into aviation like your mom?

17:57.931 --> 17:59.896
No.

17:59.931 --> 18:01.931
Or any part
of the family business.

18:01.965 --> 18:04.310
I'm not sure what I want to do,
to be honest.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.172
Well, look at it this way.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.206
You're halfway there.

18:07.241 --> 18:08.689
Halfway there?

18:08.724 --> 18:10.793
I have no idea
what I want to do with my life.

18:10.827 --> 18:12.896
Yeah, but at least you know
what you don't want to do.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.758
Oh, I see
you've met my daughter.

18:17.793 --> 18:18.896
Yes.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.448
Are those the maintenance
reports I requested?

18:20.482 --> 18:21.896
Yes.

18:21.931 --> 18:23.241
If you like, I can give you
a tour of the planes.

18:23.275 --> 18:24.379
The planes.

18:24.413 --> 18:25.413
Excellent.

18:30.827 --> 18:32.448
This is Cecilia,

18:32.482 --> 18:35.758
named after Cecilia Aragon,

18:35.793 --> 18:38.241
one of the champion
aerobatic pilots.

18:40.379 --> 18:42.206
Don't tell me you have names
for every one of your planes.

18:44.482 --> 18:45.931
We do.

18:45.965 --> 18:48.827
It's our way of honoring
female pioneers of aviation.

18:49.793 --> 18:51.068
So I'm guessing
you really love it, then.

18:52.068 --> 18:53.758
Flying?

18:53.793 --> 18:55.586
I do.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.517
I mean, I did.

18:57.551 --> 18:59.586
The duties
of managing the airline

18:59.620 --> 19:02.275
have grounded me
more than I like.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.275
But taking over
the reins from my dad

19:04.310 --> 19:05.586
has always been my goal.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.931
-Someday.
-Makes sense.

19:06.965 --> 19:08.517
What about you?

19:08.551 --> 19:10.241
Have you always had
a passion for business?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.793
Only child
of an investment banker.

19:13.931 --> 19:15.724
As a kid, I remember
the only subject that I liked

19:15.758 --> 19:17.448
almost as much as it liked me
was math.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.310
How can a subject like you?

19:20.344 --> 19:21.482
Because there's only
one right answer.

19:21.517 --> 19:22.931
Ah.

19:22.965 --> 19:23.931
And as a kid,

19:23.965 --> 19:25.758
tucked away in boarding school,

19:25.793 --> 19:28.965
I suppose I found
something reassuring about that.

19:30.724 --> 19:32.275
I've never thought about it
like that.

19:33.827 --> 19:36.034
You have to realize, though,
when it comes to business,

19:36.068 --> 19:37.724
there can always be
more than one right answer.

19:38.793 --> 19:39.793
Well, I haven't been wrong yet.

19:42.275 --> 19:43.275
There's always a first.

19:48.068 --> 19:49.379
Would you like to see some more?

19:50.413 --> 19:52.068
This way.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.931
We understand
times are tight, yes,

19:53.965 --> 19:56.551
but every dollar counts.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.620
So I can put you down for $5.00.

19:59.655 --> 20:01.517
I see you took me literally.

20:01.551 --> 20:03.482
Well, thank you
for your generosity.

20:03.517 --> 20:04.551
Bye.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.206
It sounds like

20:06.241 --> 20:09.172
Snowflake Plumbing
is in the toilet.

20:09.206 --> 20:10.448
From now on,

20:10.482 --> 20:13.000
I'm going to start saying
every hundred dollars counts.

20:16.034 --> 20:17.068
Hey, Megs,

20:17.103 --> 20:18.103
I just wanted to say

20:18.137 --> 20:21.000
thanks again
for coming out to dinner

20:21.034 --> 20:23.034
to help cheer up Dad tonight.

20:23.068 --> 20:25.862
I know that playing pretend
isn't exactly fun.

20:25.896 --> 20:27.931
No, but it's a whole lot better

20:27.965 --> 20:30.724
than the ruin the holidays
for the friends and family tour.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.172
Come January,

20:33.206 --> 20:34.206
we really need
to rip off the Band-Aid

20:34.241 --> 20:35.241
and let everyone know.

20:37.413 --> 20:38.379
We could also...

20:38.413 --> 20:39.793
This is Megan.

20:41.482 --> 20:42.724
Good evening, everyone.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.620
It is my great pleasure

20:44.655 --> 20:45.862
to announce the return

20:45.896 --> 20:48.448
of our live
holiday entertainment.

20:48.482 --> 20:51.275
Everyone, please give it up
for Silver Wings.

20:52.275 --> 20:53.655
Whoo!

20:55.724 --> 20:56.724
Charlie!

21:00.931 --> 21:03.586
♪ Dashing through the snow

21:03.620 --> 21:07.586
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh

21:07.620 --> 21:10.413
♪ O'er the fields we go

21:10.448 --> 21:14.068
♪ Laughing all the way

21:14.103 --> 21:17.172
From garage band
to center stage.

21:17.206 --> 21:18.517
What are the chances?

21:18.551 --> 21:19.689
The moment

21:19.724 --> 21:21.206
my regularly-scheduled band
canceled,

21:21.241 --> 21:22.517
I immediately thought

21:22.551 --> 21:24.551
of calling your brother
to step in.

21:24.586 --> 21:26.551
Well, for Charlie,
this is like a dream come true.

21:27.724 --> 21:28.965
And Christine was kind enough

21:29.000 --> 21:31.517
to have the tavern sponsor
two kids for Santa's Flight.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.586
Wow--

21:32.620 --> 21:33.758
Christine, that is so generous.
Thank you.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.413
Please. It is my pleasure.

21:35.448 --> 21:36.620
I look forward to seeing

21:36.655 --> 21:39.103
those precious faces light up
like a Christmas tree.

21:41.448 --> 21:42.689
Frank...

21:42.724 --> 21:44.241
it is good to see you.

21:44.275 --> 21:45.620
You haven't been out in a while.

21:45.655 --> 21:47.275
Uh, no.

21:47.310 --> 21:49.931
I'm married to my job,
and she doesn't let me out much.

21:49.965 --> 21:51.931
Well, I imagine
all that will change

21:51.965 --> 21:53.241
now that you're retired.

21:53.275 --> 21:54.586
I suspect you're right.

21:54.620 --> 21:57.103
We're going to have to find you
a hobby to keep you busy.

22:08.241 --> 22:09.724
Uh, I thought

22:09.758 --> 22:13.310
Matt was very clear
Santa's Flight was canceled.

22:13.344 --> 22:14.344
Yes.

22:14.379 --> 22:15.655
We're just exploring options

22:15.689 --> 22:18.793
to keep Santa's Flight on course
through private donations.

22:18.827 --> 22:20.517
Well, it's never a good idea

22:20.551 --> 22:22.448
to go behind
someone's back, Jenny.

22:22.482 --> 22:23.896
It's got the potential
to backfire

22:23.931 --> 22:24.896
and explode in your face.

22:24.931 --> 22:27.793
Well, we're not using
any company funds,

22:27.827 --> 22:29.655
so, technically,

22:29.689 --> 22:30.931
there's no back
we're going behind.

22:30.965 --> 22:33.793
Besides, isn't it our job
to keep Mom's dream alive

22:33.827 --> 22:35.241
and keep Santa's Flight
on course

22:35.275 --> 22:36.620
for the sake of the kids?

22:43.310 --> 22:45.413
-Mm-mm.
-Yes.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.448
Fine.

22:56.965 --> 22:58.896
I never suspected
you to be a barfly.

22:58.931 --> 23:01.275
I'm just here
to pick up some takeout.

23:02.931 --> 23:04.517
Is that your brother onstage?

23:06.344 --> 23:07.862
Before he worked
for Sundancer,

23:07.896 --> 23:09.344
he got a degree in music theory.

23:09.379 --> 23:10.448
It's his real passion.

23:10.482 --> 23:12.000
They actually sound
pretty decent.

23:12.034 --> 23:13.068
They do, don't they?

23:13.103 --> 23:14.551
♪ ...Ride and sing

23:14.586 --> 23:17.241
♪ A sleighing song tonight

23:18.379 --> 23:21.586
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells

23:21.620 --> 23:23.034
♪ Jingle all the way...

23:23.068 --> 23:24.448
If you'd like some company,

23:24.482 --> 23:25.793
you're more than welcome
to join us.

23:26.931 --> 23:28.034
Oh, thank you,

23:28.068 --> 23:29.620
but I still have to finalize
my year-end review

23:29.655 --> 23:31.379
and present it to the board.

23:31.413 --> 23:32.379
Don't you have
an accounting department

23:32.413 --> 23:33.413
for that?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.379
Yes.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.413
But I like to review

23:36.448 --> 23:37.448
and be hands-on
with the process.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.586
Of course you do.

23:38.620 --> 23:39.862
Isn't it tiring

23:39.896 --> 23:42.241
spending your life looking over
everyone's shoulder?

23:42.275 --> 23:43.379
I guess you can say

23:43.413 --> 23:44.413
I'm a guy who likes to have

23:44.448 --> 23:46.000
his hand on the wheel
at all times.

23:46.034 --> 23:47.034
That's why we have co-pilots.

23:48.068 --> 23:49.275
It can be fun for a change

23:49.310 --> 23:51.413
to let someone else
fly the plane.

23:53.241 --> 23:55.896
I guess I'll just have
to take your word for it.

23:55.931 --> 23:58.448
Good night.

23:58.482 --> 24:01.689
He really is a good time
never waiting to happen.

24:01.724 --> 24:02.724
Ugh.

24:14.551 --> 24:17.275
You looked like you were having
a great time up there.

24:17.310 --> 24:18.517
I was, actually.

24:18.551 --> 24:20.482
Dad's right.

24:20.517 --> 24:23.206
And you found a fan
in Matt Hansen.

24:23.241 --> 24:25.034
What? No way.

24:25.068 --> 24:26.172
Okay, that is
the Snowflake equivalent

24:26.206 --> 24:27.379
of a Grammy Award.

24:27.413 --> 24:30.275
All work and no play
makes Matt a dull boss.

24:30.310 --> 24:31.413
Oh, Charlie,
can you put together

24:31.448 --> 24:33.793
some ideas for
our seniors' discount campaign?

24:33.827 --> 24:34.896
Yeah. Sure thing.

24:36.413 --> 24:37.620
I'll be back.

24:49.206 --> 24:51.551
I don't see how we can reduce
the budget by 10%

24:51.586 --> 24:53.862
without forcing us
to downsize personnel.

24:53.896 --> 24:55.413
It's not your worry
anymore, Dad.

24:55.448 --> 24:56.965
It's mine, remember?

25:00.068 --> 25:01.275
Look at you.

25:01.310 --> 25:04.103
Right on time,
as per usual.

25:04.137 --> 25:07.724
I wish our flights
were as prompt as you are.

25:07.758 --> 25:08.689
Really?

25:08.724 --> 25:10.000
Why wasn't I aware
of this issue?

25:10.034 --> 25:11.275
Delays in departure
and arrival times

25:11.310 --> 25:13.068
have a negative impact on--

25:13.103 --> 25:14.206
Matt, she was joking.

25:16.310 --> 25:17.413
Ha-hah!

25:21.482 --> 25:24.413
So, as you can see,
right over here,

25:24.448 --> 25:27.896
most of our flights
are around the tri-state area.

25:27.931 --> 25:30.275
Your busiest hub appears to be
the Helena airport?

25:30.310 --> 25:31.724
-Mm-hmm.
-So why is HQ here?

25:31.758 --> 25:34.896
Snowflake is where
my grandma founded Sundancer,

25:34.931 --> 25:35.896
and besides,

25:35.931 --> 25:37.275
it's where
most of our employees live.

25:37.310 --> 25:39.896
As quaint as that sounds,

25:39.931 --> 25:42.103
my executives need to see
the bigger picture.

25:45.241 --> 25:47.931
What's going on with this flight
from Snowflake to Idaho Falls?

25:47.965 --> 25:49.344
Barely any seats have sold
on the 23rd.

25:49.379 --> 25:50.620
Why don't we combine it
with another option?

25:50.655 --> 25:52.172
No! No.

25:52.206 --> 25:54.034
This is a regular
stream of commuters

25:54.068 --> 25:55.172
from a local factory

25:55.206 --> 25:56.482
that always book last minute.

25:56.517 --> 25:58.758
So why don't we capitalize
on that fact and raise fares?

26:00.448 --> 26:02.344
Uh, say,

26:02.379 --> 26:05.034
why don't you let Jenny
drive you downtown?

26:05.068 --> 26:06.724
She can introduce you to some
of our local advertisers.

26:06.758 --> 26:08.793
I have a conference call
later this afternoon,

26:08.827 --> 26:11.896
but I suppose a little fresh air
will do me good.

26:11.931 --> 26:13.241
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.862
Hey, merry Christmas, you guys.

26:16.896 --> 26:18.344
Happy holidays to the family.

26:18.379 --> 26:19.931
Okay, this is our toy store.

26:19.965 --> 26:21.862
They display ads
on our overhead screens

26:21.896 --> 26:23.034
on a regular basis.

26:23.068 --> 26:25.482
Oh, and if you need
any last-minute Christmas gifts,

26:25.517 --> 26:27.758
they have a wonderful selection.

26:27.793 --> 26:29.241
Well, my assistant handles

26:29.275 --> 26:30.758
annual corporate
gift certificates.

26:30.793 --> 26:32.172
Right, the personal touch.

26:32.206 --> 26:33.689
-Hey, Jenny.
-Hi.

26:33.724 --> 26:35.448
I've been putting
some toys aside for Santa--

26:35.482 --> 26:36.517
That's great.
That's great, Ann,

26:36.551 --> 26:37.517
and this is Matt Hansen.

26:37.551 --> 26:39.551
Matt, Ann's son

26:39.586 --> 26:41.034
is a baggage handler for us
on weekends.

26:41.068 --> 26:42.965
-Pleasure to meet you.
-You as well.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.413
Happy holidays!

26:44.448 --> 26:45.551
Happy holidays.

26:45.586 --> 26:48.068
Do you know everybody's story?

26:48.103 --> 26:49.517
Not everybody.

26:49.551 --> 26:51.310
I wouldn't exactly call you
an open book.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.448
Although I suspect
there's more going on

26:54.482 --> 26:57.482
underneath the whole
Brooks Brothers facade.

26:58.655 --> 27:00.310
Tell you what.
Need a recharge?

27:00.344 --> 27:01.862
Fine. But make it fast.

27:01.896 --> 27:03.862
Hi. Two peppermint lattes,
please.

27:03.896 --> 27:05.241
Black coffee
will be fine for me.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.379
Oh, come on.

27:06.413 --> 27:07.862
It's my treat.

27:07.896 --> 27:09.034
Do something a little bit
out of your comfort zone.

27:09.068 --> 27:10.241
They're tasty.

27:11.551 --> 27:13.172
Fine.

27:13.206 --> 27:14.206
Light on the peppermint.

27:17.206 --> 27:20.206
So the theater
runs in-flight ads as well?

27:20.241 --> 27:21.724
The opposite.

27:21.758 --> 27:24.413
We advertise our promotions
before movie trailers.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.379
I used to take Chloe here
when she was a kid.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.965
She used to love
seeing the family logo

27:30.000 --> 27:31.620
on the big screen.

27:31.655 --> 27:32.655
Ah-hah.

27:32.689 --> 27:34.034
The circle of life.

27:34.068 --> 27:35.206
Mm-hmm.

27:35.241 --> 27:37.034
And Chloe's dad?

27:37.068 --> 27:38.413
Divorced.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.034
We married young,

27:41.068 --> 27:43.172
had Chloe young,
grew apart.

27:43.206 --> 27:44.931
Mostly, I think
he couldn't stand

27:44.965 --> 27:46.448
the heat of being
with the captain.

27:46.482 --> 27:47.448
Mm-hmm.

27:47.482 --> 27:48.620
What about you?

27:48.655 --> 27:50.172
Divorced.

27:50.206 --> 27:51.793
Death by work ethic?

27:53.206 --> 27:55.275
Any regrets?

27:55.310 --> 27:56.965
Only one.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.275
Should have bought Tesla stock
when it broke $200 a share.

28:03.448 --> 28:04.448
What?

28:07.413 --> 28:08.379
Never mind.

28:08.413 --> 28:09.965
No, really.
What's so funny?

28:11.965 --> 28:13.862
I just, you know,

28:13.896 --> 28:15.689
keep trying to peel back
the layers of the onion

28:15.724 --> 28:18.206
just to find
some soft, gushy side.

28:18.241 --> 28:20.551
But really, you're just
a hopeless pragmatic.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.827
Sorry. That was
for Captain Jenny.

28:26.793 --> 28:28.310
Cover me! Or not.

28:29.482 --> 28:30.275
Benjamin...

28:30.310 --> 28:31.310
I'm gonna get you!

28:31.344 --> 28:32.379
Hey!

28:32.413 --> 28:33.413
Here it comes!

28:35.965 --> 28:36.965
Hey!

28:40.551 --> 28:41.517
Okay, okay.

28:41.551 --> 28:42.896
Truce!

28:42.931 --> 28:45.034
Truce. Truce.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.275
You win. You win.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.034
You remember, Benjamin.
This is Matt.

28:50.068 --> 28:51.655
Are you Captain Jenny's
boyfriend?

28:52.827 --> 28:54.068
Wh-- No, silly.

28:54.103 --> 28:55.448
He's my boss.

28:57.724 --> 28:58.793
Come on, Benjamin.
Let's go.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.275
Bye. Bye.

29:03.551 --> 29:04.551
Bye.

29:08.724 --> 29:09.965
Your first snowball fight?

29:10.931 --> 29:12.137
How did you know that was...

29:13.137 --> 29:14.137
That obvious, huh?

29:15.827 --> 29:17.551
Must be an offshoot
of being an only child.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.551
That's rough.

29:20.586 --> 29:22.551
I'm so grateful
my parents adopted Charlie.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.724
He's like my best friend.

29:23.758 --> 29:26.310
My heart goes out
to all the adoptive parents,

29:26.344 --> 29:28.000
the single mothers.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.413
I think Hayley is
a great foster mom.

29:32.448 --> 29:33.551
But she really shouldn't
bring Benjamin to work with her.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.827
We're not running a daycare.

29:41.827 --> 29:43.034
Right...

30:08.448 --> 30:10.551
She shoots, she scores!

30:10.586 --> 30:12.793
What? What's all the whoo-hooing
going on in here?

30:12.827 --> 30:14.482
I volunteered
to create a website

30:14.517 --> 30:17.172
for people to start donating
to Santa's Flight.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.793
I put in profiles

30:18.827 --> 30:21.068
of all the children
we're trying to sponsor

30:21.103 --> 30:23.448
as well as gift wish lists
for people to help donate.

30:23.482 --> 30:24.551
Chloe, you did all this?

30:24.586 --> 30:25.931
Yeah. Why?

30:25.965 --> 30:27.620
This is amazing.

30:27.655 --> 30:29.275
It shows genuine talent.

30:29.310 --> 30:30.275
Thanks.

30:30.310 --> 30:31.379
You know, you really
should consider...

30:34.275 --> 30:36.034
that you have such a gift.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.172
Thanks, Chloe.

30:38.206 --> 30:42.068
This website will really help
make our goal a reality.

30:42.103 --> 30:43.103
So...

30:43.137 --> 30:45.068
how are you and Matt
getting along?

30:45.103 --> 30:46.206
Fine.

30:46.241 --> 30:48.896
If you can stand
the constant windchill factor.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.586
It's like one second
he seems like an adult,

30:50.620 --> 30:51.758
and the next

30:51.793 --> 30:53.965
he acts like a calculator
in a three-piece suit.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.413
Well, maybe you just
haven't found his number.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.034
You have to admit, though,

31:00.068 --> 31:01.551
he is kind of cute.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.862
No. Show me this.

31:11.241 --> 31:12.448
Oh.

31:12.482 --> 31:15.241
I must not have gotten the memo
about casual Friday.

31:15.275 --> 31:16.379
Oh.

31:16.413 --> 31:17.586
I figured this might be
more fitting attire

31:17.620 --> 31:18.724
in case I find myself

31:18.758 --> 31:20.758
in the throes of another
rogue snowball fight.

31:23.413 --> 31:25.241
That's funny.

31:25.275 --> 31:26.551
Okay.

31:26.586 --> 31:28.068
Well, I just finished meeting
with your engineering team,

31:28.103 --> 31:29.620
and I'm happily impressed.

31:31.068 --> 31:32.310
Whoa.

31:32.344 --> 31:34.034
Was that a genuine compliment?

31:34.068 --> 31:35.103
Now I'm impressed.

31:35.137 --> 31:37.724
Jenny, I'm sorry
if you got the idea

31:37.758 --> 31:39.551
my purpose here
was simply to find flaws.

31:39.586 --> 31:40.586
Can you say that again?

31:41.655 --> 31:42.793
I'm here to see
the full picture.

31:42.827 --> 31:44.965
No, the part
where you apologized.

31:47.965 --> 31:49.965
See, now you really
should do that more often.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.275
What, apologize?

31:51.310 --> 31:53.724
Smile.

31:53.758 --> 31:55.034
You know, you don't have
to go around all the time

31:55.068 --> 31:57.827
with a look on your face
like a balloon payment is due.

31:58.931 --> 32:00.689
I'll put that
on my to-do list.

32:00.724 --> 32:02.103
Right after I get back
from Helena

32:02.137 --> 32:03.344
to check out their facility.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.689
What for?

32:04.724 --> 32:06.068
I thought you were here
to visit and tour our operation.

32:06.103 --> 32:08.034
In case you haven't noticed,
I like to be thorough.

32:08.068 --> 32:09.620
You're going to waste
so much time

32:09.655 --> 32:10.793
driving to and from Helena.

32:10.827 --> 32:12.724
I'm covering the route
three different times today.

32:12.758 --> 32:14.241
I can fly you in and out.

32:14.275 --> 32:15.206
Nobody gets hurt.

32:15.241 --> 32:16.931
No! I mean, I really
don't mind driving.

32:16.965 --> 32:18.517
I find it relaxing.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.689
But it can take hours
in either direction,

32:20.724 --> 32:21.689
and that's if you're lucky.

32:21.724 --> 32:23.517
I get a lot
of brainstorming done

32:23.551 --> 32:25.034
on the road.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.517
It's meditative.

32:26.551 --> 32:27.689
Don't be ridiculous.

32:27.724 --> 32:29.896
You said you wanted
to see the full picture,

32:29.931 --> 32:31.724
and you have seen
everything we do

32:31.758 --> 32:34.482
except for the whole point
of an airline...

32:34.517 --> 32:35.620
the actual flights.

32:35.655 --> 32:36.620
That settles it.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.655
Settles what?

32:39.103 --> 32:40.655
I'm making
my first executive decision.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.379
Come on!

32:45.068 --> 32:46.793
Welcome aboard
Sundancer flight 83.

32:46.827 --> 32:49.068
We are en route
from Snowflake to Helena.

32:49.103 --> 32:51.241
The flying time
is just under an hour,

32:51.275 --> 32:54.896
and we've got clear skies
and a frosty 28 degrees.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.655
Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

32:59.172 --> 33:00.551
Hey, mister.

33:02.310 --> 33:03.862
Are you nervous about flying?

33:05.137 --> 33:06.068
A little.

33:06.103 --> 33:08.000
I used to be scared of flying

33:08.034 --> 33:11.034
until Captain Beckett
gave me these.

33:12.482 --> 33:13.724
If you start to feel scared,

33:13.758 --> 33:14.758
just breathe.

33:24.655 --> 33:25.724
You're doing good.

33:36.758 --> 33:38.448
Yes, that's his coat.
Thanks, Molly. I got it.

33:40.655 --> 33:42.551
Oh, here you go.

33:42.586 --> 33:43.551
Great flight.

33:43.586 --> 33:44.620
Put me right to sleep.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.000
Uh-huh.

33:46.034 --> 33:47.724
I'll pick you back up at 4:30.

33:58.793 --> 34:00.482
Hey. Everything okay?

34:00.517 --> 34:01.448
Yeah.

34:01.482 --> 34:02.517
Just have a few routine
safety checks

34:02.551 --> 34:03.758
to do out on the tarmac,

34:03.793 --> 34:06.206
and Benjamin is going to be
my apprentice again.

34:06.241 --> 34:07.586
Right, mister?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.034
Actually...

34:10.068 --> 34:11.620
would it be okay

34:11.655 --> 34:14.413
if Benjamin joins me
for my last trip of the day?

34:14.448 --> 34:15.931
I promise
I'll have him home by dinner.

34:18.482 --> 34:19.413
That sounds great.

34:19.448 --> 34:20.413
Yeah!

34:20.448 --> 34:22.275
Let's go, Benjamin.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.620
Have fun.

34:27.758 --> 34:29.241
Blue skies
on the way back.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.586
No turbulence.
We'll be good.

34:32.551 --> 34:34.034
Oh, welcome back aboard.

34:34.068 --> 34:35.413
How was your inspection
here in Helena?

34:35.448 --> 34:37.241
I got the information I needed.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.344
Good.

34:38.379 --> 34:39.758
Oh, so you know,
you won't be traveling alone.

34:39.793 --> 34:41.241
Hayley had to work late,

34:41.275 --> 34:44.379
but Benjamin will be joining us
as our special VIP guest.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.620
-Have a nice flight.
-Thank you.

34:59.482 --> 35:01.448
Mr. Hansen, this is
my 14th time on a plane.

35:01.482 --> 35:03.034
Isn't that cool?

35:03.068 --> 35:04.931
Uh-huh.

35:04.965 --> 35:05.896
Super-cool.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.000
Hello, fliers.

35:09.034 --> 35:10.310
Please ensure that
your seat belts are buckled

35:10.344 --> 35:12.275
and your tray tables
are in the upright position

35:12.310 --> 35:14.172
as we taxi on the runway.
Thank you.

35:14.206 --> 35:18.034
Sometimes, I like to sit back
and pretend I'm the pilot.

35:18.068 --> 35:19.103
Want to be my co-pilot?

35:26.275 --> 35:27.241
Sure.

35:42.586 --> 35:43.896
Hello, folks.

35:43.931 --> 35:46.758
We have now reached
our maximum cruising altitude.

35:46.793 --> 35:50.448
It is a gorgeous, sunny day
on all sides of the aircraft.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.034
So, please, sit back, relax,

35:52.068 --> 35:54.724
and enjoy flying
with Sundancer Airlines.

35:54.758 --> 35:56.586
I'm an only child, too.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.034
It's okay.
You'll get used to it.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.137
And you can make
lots of friends.

36:00.172 --> 36:01.965
Like the friends
who ambushed me downtown?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.172
Yeah.

36:03.206 --> 36:04.965
We got you
and Captain Jenny good.

36:06.586 --> 36:08.206
I can't wait to tell them
I got to fly today.

36:08.241 --> 36:09.620
Flying's my favorite.

36:09.655 --> 36:12.551
I know everything there is
to know about airplanes.

36:12.586 --> 36:14.103
I own this airline now.

36:14.137 --> 36:15.620
So I could probably tell you
a thing or two.

36:16.655 --> 36:18.517
This plane's an Avro RJ 100.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.310
It seats 100 passengers,

36:20.344 --> 36:21.965
two pilots,
and one flight attendant,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.137
and it has turbofan engines.

36:24.448 --> 36:25.793
Wow. You weren't kidding.

36:26.793 --> 36:27.896
I'm going to be a pilot
when I grow up,

36:27.931 --> 36:29.137
just like Captain Jenny.

36:29.172 --> 36:30.413
Huh.

36:30.448 --> 36:32.482
Did you know the wingspan
is 86 feet long?

36:33.517 --> 36:35.551
I did not.

36:35.586 --> 36:36.931
But now I do.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.103
No.

36:42.137 --> 36:43.724
Christine doesn't have
a thing for my dad.

36:43.758 --> 36:47.793
Oh, I could spot the signals
a mile away.

36:47.827 --> 36:52.103
But your dad either seems
oblivious or unwilling, so...

36:52.137 --> 36:53.793
I mean, honestly,
it's probably a bit of both.

36:53.827 --> 36:55.793
After my mom passed away,

36:55.827 --> 36:57.655
I kind of thought he hung up
the dating hat for good.

36:58.793 --> 37:01.517
Maybe it's time
he dusts it off.

37:01.551 --> 37:04.000
Oh, you're not really thinking
about playing Cupid, are you?

37:04.034 --> 37:05.965
Why not?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.344
With you and I
keeping up appearances,

37:07.379 --> 37:08.551
it might be fun

37:08.586 --> 37:09.827
to help somebody else
find happiness.

37:12.413 --> 37:13.379
Hello, folks.

37:13.413 --> 37:14.482
We are on our final descent.

37:14.517 --> 37:16.103
We will be
on the ground shortly.

37:46.068 --> 37:48.551
♪ And a happy new year

37:55.310 --> 37:56.965
-♪ And a happy new year
-Hi!

37:57.000 --> 37:59.551
Hey, look at you,
out on a school night.

37:59.586 --> 38:01.310
I suppose so.

38:01.344 --> 38:03.241
Dad's always needling me
to go out more.

38:03.275 --> 38:04.793
And he's right.

38:05.724 --> 38:08.034
Oh, is that your hot date?

38:08.068 --> 38:10.551
It's more like my new boss.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.241
Um, hello.

38:12.275 --> 38:14.034
Christine, this is Matt Hansen.

38:14.068 --> 38:15.413
So you are the villain

38:15.448 --> 38:17.137
who's been shaking things up
at Sundancer?

38:17.172 --> 38:18.172
Yes.

38:18.206 --> 38:19.379
I'm here to burn off
a little steam

38:19.413 --> 38:20.482
after putting pink slips

38:20.517 --> 38:23.034
in the stockings
of some of my employees.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.034
He's joking.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.241
Wait. You're joking, right?

38:27.655 --> 38:28.965
You're just here
to pick up takeout.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.379
Actually, I was hoping
to dine in

38:30.413 --> 38:32.551
rather than spend another meal
stuck in my hotel room.

38:32.586 --> 38:33.793
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:33.827 --> 38:36.310
I am afraid that all
of my tables are booked.

38:36.344 --> 38:40.068
Unless Jenny doesn't mind
you sharing her table.

38:40.103 --> 38:41.586
Oh, um, sure. Yeah.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.586
Yeah, that works.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
Great. Right this way.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.413
This way.

38:48.965 --> 38:55.379
♪ And a happy new year

39:09.379 --> 39:11.344
I just think
men can be oblivious,

39:11.379 --> 39:12.586
you know, sometimes,

39:12.620 --> 39:14.965
when it comes to reading signals
from the opposite sex.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.103
Oh, I suppose,

39:16.137 --> 39:19.034
but you and Charlie
hit it off right away.

39:19.068 --> 39:21.034
Please.

39:21.068 --> 39:23.448
He was completely oblivious

39:23.482 --> 39:25.793
I had a crush on him
when we first met.

39:25.827 --> 39:27.931
I mean, I had to practically
hit him over the head

39:27.965 --> 39:29.241
to get him to ask me out.

39:29.275 --> 39:30.310
Oh, come on.

39:30.344 --> 39:31.862
I do not believe that
for a minute.

39:31.896 --> 39:33.241
You two make the perfect pair.

39:33.275 --> 39:35.482
I can see that you are
the yin to his yang.

39:36.793 --> 39:39.275
That's what I thought
when we first met.

39:43.034 --> 39:44.689
Just out of curiosity, Megan,

39:44.724 --> 39:45.758
why are you telling me
all of this?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.724
Well, I saw how you were
with Frank last night.

39:49.758 --> 39:51.965
And if you think he has

39:52.000 --> 39:54.413
the potential to be
the yin to your yang,

39:54.448 --> 39:55.448
you need to be direct.

40:04.862 --> 40:05.758
Don't take this the wrong way,

40:05.793 --> 40:07.103
but...

40:07.137 --> 40:08.758
I actually had fun today.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.551
That's really nice.

40:12.586 --> 40:14.241
And a little surprising.

40:14.275 --> 40:15.689
You knew, didn't you?

40:15.724 --> 40:18.206
About my apprehension
with flying?

40:18.241 --> 40:20.000
I managed to put
the pieces together.

40:21.068 --> 40:22.620
But isn't it a little bit ironic

40:22.655 --> 40:24.793
that you enjoy
running an airline?

40:25.793 --> 40:28.517
I think it's like a moth
being drawn to the flame.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.517
There's something I find

40:29.551 --> 40:31.965
utterly terrifying
about air travel.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.241
And equally fascinating.

40:35.586 --> 40:38.068
I think I'm finally starting
to figure out who you are.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.103
Is that so?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.103
Mm-hmm.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.206
Care to share
your observations?

40:43.551 --> 40:45.448
Well...

40:45.482 --> 40:48.448
okay, if you don't mind
my saying,

40:48.482 --> 40:49.931
you're a little bit
of a control freak.

40:51.137 --> 40:52.448
Well--

40:53.448 --> 40:54.448
True.

40:55.586 --> 40:56.758
You get on a plane,

40:56.793 --> 40:59.137
and you can't look over
anyone's shoulder.

40:59.172 --> 41:00.724
And you have to put your trust

41:00.758 --> 41:02.620
in someone else
to have the control.

41:02.655 --> 41:03.965
That's where
your fear comes from.

41:06.103 --> 41:08.034
I never really
thought of it that way, but...

41:08.068 --> 41:09.137
maybe you have a point.

41:10.896 --> 41:13.413
Okay, my only final
question is,

41:13.448 --> 41:16.206
who is responsible
for these trust issues?

41:16.241 --> 41:17.172
Your ex-wife?

41:17.206 --> 41:18.724
Or a best friend, maybe?

41:21.241 --> 41:23.034
Wow.

41:23.068 --> 41:24.586
Um...

41:26.620 --> 41:29.724
Both, actually.

41:29.758 --> 41:32.310
My wife didn't leave me
because I'm a workaholic.

41:32.344 --> 41:34.241
My wife left me
for my best friend.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.068
Wow.

41:40.103 --> 41:42.379
Matt, that's, um...

41:42.413 --> 41:43.896
I'm so sorry.

41:47.206 --> 41:49.724
So to take the sting off
all the hurt and betrayal,

41:49.758 --> 41:51.965
I poured myself into
the one thing I was good at.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.137
Business.

41:56.896 --> 41:58.448
Yeah, when things ended
with my ex,

41:58.482 --> 42:01.482
I felt the weight of the world
on my shoulders,

42:01.517 --> 42:02.517
and I was trying to take care

42:02.551 --> 42:05.724
of Chloe
and the rest of my family.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.724
Well, from what I can tell,
you're doing a great job.

42:12.758 --> 42:13.862
Thanks.

42:13.896 --> 42:14.931
I like to think so.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.586
So...

42:20.620 --> 42:23.034
working for your family
your whole career,

42:23.068 --> 42:25.482
you ever felt the need
to leave the nest?

42:25.517 --> 42:26.931
Fly out on your own?

42:26.965 --> 42:28.241
I did.

42:28.275 --> 42:30.206
Actually, I got offered
a big job in New York

42:30.241 --> 42:32.103
to fly internationally,

42:32.137 --> 42:34.206
which has always been
my dream to travel.

42:34.241 --> 42:35.793
And?

42:35.827 --> 42:37.068
You know, Chloe.

42:37.103 --> 42:38.689
She wasn't even five yet,

42:38.724 --> 42:43.206
and my marriage was building up
ice on the wings.

42:46.517 --> 42:47.931
Do you ever think about
what might have been?

42:49.793 --> 42:51.241
Well, life comes
with sacrifices.

42:51.275 --> 42:53.724
And...

42:53.758 --> 42:55.482
I don't believe
in living life with regrets.

42:59.241 --> 43:01.862
That may be true, but...

43:01.896 --> 43:03.275
you never answered my question.

43:29.379 --> 43:31.827
Snowflake's very own
handbell choir.

43:34.931 --> 43:37.896
It's memories I have
with Chloe like this

43:37.931 --> 43:39.793
while she was growing up.

43:39.827 --> 43:41.793
I wouldn't trade them
for one week in Paris.

43:43.034 --> 43:44.724
You have a lot
of family traditions.

43:44.758 --> 43:46.620
Mm-hmm.

43:48.551 --> 43:49.517
And what about you?

43:49.551 --> 43:51.965
I assume you spent holidays
with your dad

43:52.000 --> 43:53.137
away from boarding school?

43:53.172 --> 43:54.896
Yeah, he always used
to fly me out to Manhattan

43:54.931 --> 43:57.931
for the firm's office party.

43:57.965 --> 44:00.137
Did you have Christmas
traditions together?

44:00.172 --> 44:03.206
Only one, really.

44:03.241 --> 44:04.310
I remember

44:04.344 --> 44:05.931
he always used to take me
to Rockefeller Center

44:05.965 --> 44:07.655
on Christmas Eve.

44:07.689 --> 44:09.275
He said if I wished hard enough,

44:09.310 --> 44:12.206
at midnight, my Christmas wish
might come true.

44:12.241 --> 44:13.206
That's sweet.

44:13.241 --> 44:14.379
And did they?

44:14.413 --> 44:15.379
Most of the time,
he was right.

44:15.413 --> 44:16.724
Other times, I figured

44:16.758 --> 44:18.586
I just wasn't
wishing hard enough.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.724
-Oh.

44:24.275 --> 44:25.862
Hansen here.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.758
Oh, hi, Mr. Connor.

44:27.793 --> 44:29.413
Yes, I took a look
at the office space in Helena

44:29.448 --> 44:30.793
earlier today,

44:30.827 --> 44:32.275
and I think it will work well
as our new base.

44:32.310 --> 44:34.206
Mm-hmm.

44:34.241 --> 44:35.275
Understood.

44:35.310 --> 44:36.586
Give my respects
to the board.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.034
New base?

44:41.068 --> 44:41.931
I thought you went to Helena

44:41.965 --> 44:43.551
just to check out
the operations.

44:43.586 --> 44:45.517
Yes, I've been evaluating
various options.

44:45.551 --> 44:46.689
It's more sensible
to be centralized

44:46.724 --> 44:48.241
and to move
the company headquarters

44:48.275 --> 44:49.896
where the company
has most of its activity.

44:49.931 --> 44:52.344
I told you Sundancer
has to stay in Snowflake.

44:52.379 --> 44:55.758
I can't ask the staff
to uproot their lives.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.379
I understand
the decision has consequences,

44:58.413 --> 44:59.931
but it's the right thing to do.

44:59.965 --> 45:02.068
Yeah, for you, of course.

45:02.103 --> 45:03.689
When were you going
to tell me about this plan?

45:03.724 --> 45:05.310
You're not my VP of operations
at this point.

45:05.344 --> 45:06.620
I realize that,

45:06.655 --> 45:07.793
but, apparently,

45:07.827 --> 45:10.655
what, there's no "i" in team
or "we" either?

45:10.689 --> 45:13.034
Don't I get an opportunity
to at least weigh in

45:13.068 --> 45:14.793
instead of just being
left out in the cold?

45:17.068 --> 45:19.034
You know what?
Thank you for dinner.

45:19.068 --> 45:20.034
It was a real treat.

45:32.068 --> 45:34.896
This house smells like
a Christmas cookie explosion.

45:34.931 --> 45:37.655
You know how baking relaxes me
whenever I'm upset.

45:38.758 --> 45:40.724
Who's responsible
for pushing you to level orange?

45:40.758 --> 45:43.241
Matt Hansen.

45:43.275 --> 45:44.931
We met
down at the tavern earlier

45:44.965 --> 45:46.206
to watch your uncle play.

45:46.241 --> 45:47.448
It began nice enough,

45:47.482 --> 45:49.172
but, of course, he had to pull
the rug out from under me

45:49.206 --> 45:50.413
before the night was over.

45:50.448 --> 45:54.034
You know, for someone
who can't seem to stand the guy,

45:54.068 --> 45:55.931
you sure are spending
a lot of time together.

45:55.965 --> 45:57.275
It's not that
I can't stand him.

45:57.310 --> 45:58.344
It's that I resent

45:58.379 --> 45:59.551
not being included

45:59.586 --> 46:01.172
in major decisions
regarding the airline.

46:01.206 --> 46:02.517
You mean, like,

46:02.551 --> 46:03.793
how you're not telling him

46:03.827 --> 46:06.068
about how you're trying
to save Santa's Flight?

46:06.103 --> 46:07.241
That's different.

46:07.275 --> 46:08.551
We're simply exploring options

46:08.586 --> 46:09.965
on how to keep it afloat
through donations.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.413
Have you told him about it?

46:13.206 --> 46:15.206
Then you are
keeping it a secret.

46:15.241 --> 46:16.448
Secrets mean
you're up to something bad.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.482
But I'm not.

46:23.310 --> 46:24.931
Thank you.
Happy holidays.

46:28.517 --> 46:29.517
Frank.

46:29.551 --> 46:30.551
What a lovely surprise.

46:30.586 --> 46:31.586
How are you?

46:31.620 --> 46:34.310
Uh, pretty great, actually.

46:34.344 --> 46:36.206
Just been out canvassing
a few businesses

46:36.241 --> 46:39.137
about sponsoring some more kids
on Santa's Flight.

46:39.172 --> 46:40.896
Oh, by that chipper demeanor,

46:40.931 --> 46:42.241
I'd say the day went well.

46:42.275 --> 46:47.275
Well, I got Aunt Trudy's Diner
to sponsor two more kids.

46:47.310 --> 46:48.758
So we've got four days to go.

46:48.793 --> 46:50.034
We're cutting it
a little close.

46:52.793 --> 46:56.068
You wouldn't want to join me
at the theater, would you?

46:56.103 --> 46:58.310
They're playing
It's a Wonderful Life.

46:58.344 --> 46:59.758
I haven't seen that in ages.

47:00.827 --> 47:02.965
It still holds up,
if you care to come with.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.931
You know what?
It's okay.

47:07.965 --> 47:09.827
I'm sure you've got
lots of other things to do.

47:09.862 --> 47:11.413
Happy holidays, Frank.

47:18.206 --> 47:19.206
This is Matt.

47:19.241 --> 47:21.586
Hi, it's Jenny.

47:21.620 --> 47:24.620
I realize I may have come off
a little prickly earlier.

47:24.655 --> 47:26.034
I want to apologize.

47:26.068 --> 47:27.241
No need.

47:27.275 --> 47:28.862
You like to speak your mind.

47:28.896 --> 47:31.000
That's an important trait
for any VP position.

47:31.034 --> 47:32.517
Really?

47:32.551 --> 47:34.137
Then why have I wasted
all this time

47:34.172 --> 47:36.241
holding back in telling you
how I really feel?

47:36.275 --> 47:39.068
If it wasn't for
that tiny filter of yours,

47:39.103 --> 47:40.551
I doubt we would have
ever gotten this far.

47:40.586 --> 47:41.724
On that note,

47:41.758 --> 47:43.517
I wanted to see
if you were free tomorrow.

47:43.551 --> 47:44.896
Say, later afternoon?

47:44.931 --> 47:46.827
What do you have in mind?

47:46.862 --> 47:50.068
You let me in to one
of your Christmas traditions

47:50.103 --> 47:51.241
growing up.

47:51.275 --> 47:52.896
I thought I'd share
with you one of mine.

47:53.931 --> 47:55.517
Sure, why not.
It's a date.

47:57.275 --> 48:01.137
I mean, not a date-date,
obviously.

48:03.724 --> 48:05.103
I will see you then.

48:16.344 --> 48:18.379
All I'm asking you
to consider

48:18.413 --> 48:20.206
is how moving to Helena

48:20.241 --> 48:21.655
will risk losing

48:21.689 --> 48:24.793
the strong relationships we have
with vendors here in Snowflake.

48:26.068 --> 48:27.034
Why do I get the feeling

48:27.068 --> 48:28.413
I was brought here
under false pretenses?

48:28.448 --> 48:30.517
I just wish
I had said it to you last night.

48:30.551 --> 48:31.724
Before you stormed off.

48:33.275 --> 48:34.724
About that...

48:34.758 --> 48:36.172
Could we really
consider it a storm?

48:37.586 --> 48:38.482
What's going on here?

48:38.517 --> 48:40.482
Tree-trimming time.

48:40.517 --> 48:43.000
We got a late start this year
on account of...

48:44.448 --> 48:45.551
Dad and Charlie are coming,

48:45.586 --> 48:48.586
and I thought you could join us
for some eggnog

48:48.620 --> 48:50.689
and learn a little more
about Snowflake.

48:50.724 --> 48:53.862
Trust me, I already got
an earful from Sue.

48:53.896 --> 48:55.689
She certainly loves
to small-talk.

49:03.793 --> 49:04.965
What is this?

49:07.620 --> 49:10.241
Mom's 25-year service pin.

49:10.275 --> 49:11.275
The design is an homage

49:11.310 --> 49:13.517
to an ace World War I
fighter pilot

49:13.551 --> 49:15.034
who started
his own private airline

49:15.068 --> 49:16.000
after the war.

49:16.034 --> 49:17.689
Incredible.

49:17.724 --> 49:19.724
It is to aviation junkies
like me.

49:19.758 --> 49:21.172
Is it real gold?

49:21.206 --> 49:23.965
24-karat gold,
with a rare amber diamond.

49:27.241 --> 49:29.896
Mom and Grandma collected
all of this memorabilia.

49:30.896 --> 49:33.379
Passed it down to me.

49:33.413 --> 49:34.758
It must be valuable.

49:35.793 --> 49:38.034
A local collector
offered a fortune,

49:38.068 --> 49:39.620
but the sentimental value
is way more important to me.

49:39.655 --> 49:41.586
Of course.

49:47.034 --> 49:49.310
Oh, no.

49:49.344 --> 49:50.413
I'm sorry.

49:50.448 --> 49:51.758
Is there a work emergency
we don't know about?

49:51.793 --> 49:52.793
Are we all getting
pink-slipped?

49:52.827 --> 49:55.000
Not funny, Charlie.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.034
Matt is my guest.

49:56.068 --> 49:57.206
So who's ready

49:57.241 --> 49:59.896
to get this Christmas tree
decorating party started?

49:59.931 --> 50:01.379
Okay.

50:01.413 --> 50:03.517
Team, everybody,
get to your stations.

50:03.551 --> 50:05.758
Chloe, Megan,
you are on ornaments.

50:05.793 --> 50:07.482
Charlie, you are
on tinsel and tunes.

50:07.517 --> 50:09.586
Dad, you have to untangle
the twinkle lights.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.689
Anybody want to trade?

50:10.724 --> 50:14.068
And Matt, you can sit back
and enjoy the action

50:14.103 --> 50:15.620
while I get the eggnog.

50:16.517 --> 50:17.551
Nice delegating.

50:19.448 --> 50:22.482
"And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,

50:22.517 --> 50:26.068
'Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.'"

50:28.241 --> 50:30.034
Yay!

50:30.068 --> 50:31.310
Thanks, Dad.

50:31.344 --> 50:33.379
Now it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

50:34.586 --> 50:35.655
Thanks for inviting me.

50:35.689 --> 50:36.758
And thank you all

50:36.793 --> 50:38.896
for the many enlightening facts
about town.

50:38.931 --> 50:39.931
Oh, I hope you took notes.

50:39.965 --> 50:41.000
There will be a quiz.

50:43.758 --> 50:44.758
Dinner is served.

50:44.793 --> 50:45.793
Oh, good.

50:47.241 --> 50:49.620
So has anyone
started thinking about

50:49.655 --> 50:50.586
making New Year's resolutions?

50:50.620 --> 50:51.620
Dad?

50:52.620 --> 50:54.034
I don't believe
in that nonsense.

50:54.068 --> 50:55.413
Ah.

50:55.448 --> 50:57.000
Short and pithy,
I'll give him that.

50:58.103 --> 50:59.517
What about you, Charlie?

50:59.551 --> 51:02.137
Uh, well, New Year's
is about making a fresh start,

51:02.172 --> 51:03.586
so I am looking forward

51:03.620 --> 51:07.655
to seeing the exciting
new prospects in my future.

51:07.689 --> 51:09.689
My plan is to write down
a list of personal goals.

51:09.724 --> 51:11.034
Studies show

51:11.068 --> 51:13.103
you are more likely to achieve
the things you want in life

51:13.137 --> 51:14.448
if you write them down on paper.

51:15.758 --> 51:17.034
In that case,

51:17.068 --> 51:18.172
maybe I should write down

51:18.206 --> 51:21.448
the top three universities
I hope to get accepted to

51:21.482 --> 51:23.551
now that I've decided
to get into web design.

51:23.586 --> 51:24.689
I was telling Chloe

51:24.724 --> 51:26.068
if she had any interest

51:26.103 --> 51:27.689
in applying
to some tech colleges,

51:27.724 --> 51:29.517
I would be willing to write her
a letter of recommendation.

51:30.620 --> 51:33.000
That is so generous, Matt.

51:34.413 --> 51:36.862
And Chloe, I'm so proud
that this is your decision.

51:39.517 --> 51:40.517
What about you?

51:40.551 --> 51:43.103
Any earth-shattering
personal goals

51:43.137 --> 51:44.586
you'd like to share
with the group?

51:45.965 --> 51:47.103
Yeah.

51:50.103 --> 51:51.172
I've always dreaded
the month of December

51:51.206 --> 51:52.413
because it reminded me

51:52.448 --> 51:54.034
it was the profit/loss
time of the year.

51:56.068 --> 51:57.689
And how do you plan
on changing that?

51:59.068 --> 52:00.137
I'm not sure.

52:00.172 --> 52:02.103
But tonight has been
a welcome respite.

52:03.586 --> 52:06.758
Maybe I'll start a special
tradition of my own.

52:08.965 --> 52:10.206
I like the sound of that.

52:10.241 --> 52:11.448
What about you, Mom?

52:13.413 --> 52:15.862
Well, with all the shakeups
going on at the airline,

52:15.896 --> 52:17.586
Dad retiring,

52:17.620 --> 52:20.689
and you almost finished
with high school,

52:20.724 --> 52:22.827
I finally think it's time

52:22.862 --> 52:24.931
I start mapping out
the next chapter in my life.

52:27.689 --> 52:30.655
Well, my guess is
it'll be a real page-turner.

52:31.896 --> 52:32.896
I hope so.

52:32.931 --> 52:34.448
To the new year.

52:40.034 --> 52:42.896
It's hard when the child
becomes the parent,

52:42.931 --> 52:45.034
but I sat my dad down,

52:45.068 --> 52:47.482
and I told him he's retired,

52:47.517 --> 52:51.344
he needs to open himself up more
to new challenges.

52:51.379 --> 52:53.206
Hmm. How did he respond?

52:53.241 --> 52:54.758
Well, he's a little bit
hard to read,

52:54.793 --> 52:58.068
but I imagine
he got the message.

52:58.103 --> 52:59.482
Well, I have hope.

52:59.517 --> 53:01.068
Me too.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.413
Oh, I totally
forgot to tell you.

53:04.448 --> 53:06.689
The principal
from Snowflake Elementary?

53:06.724 --> 53:07.931
He was in the audience
the other night,

53:07.965 --> 53:09.034
and he called and said

53:09.068 --> 53:09.931
that they're looking
for a new music teacher.

53:09.965 --> 53:11.241
Really?

53:11.275 --> 53:12.517
Charlie, music is your passion.

53:12.551 --> 53:13.517
What are you waiting for?

53:15.103 --> 53:16.793
Well, I can't just
leave the airline

53:16.827 --> 53:18.000
and let Jenny down.

53:19.413 --> 53:21.517
Charlie, how many times
have we been through this?

53:21.551 --> 53:22.655
You hate working in marketing.

53:24.275 --> 53:25.275
Once again,
this is fate calling,

53:25.310 --> 53:26.241
and what do you do?

53:26.275 --> 53:28.034
You stand frozen
in the headlights,

53:28.068 --> 53:29.586
ready to let
the best thing in your life

53:29.620 --> 53:30.586
slip through your fingers.

53:30.620 --> 53:32.379
Wait.

53:32.413 --> 53:34.551
Are we talking about
the job prospect?

53:34.586 --> 53:36.172
Or are we talking
about you and me?

53:37.068 --> 53:39.206
What difference
does it make, Charlie?

53:39.241 --> 53:40.758
You're incapable
of changing who you are.

53:50.275 --> 53:51.896
I'll clean up in a bit.

53:53.620 --> 53:56.413
I was hoping
you'd be up for a stroll

53:56.448 --> 53:58.862
after that heavy meal?

53:58.896 --> 54:01.310
Sure. Sounds nice.

54:06.103 --> 54:08.896
So when are you
flying back to Portland?

54:08.931 --> 54:11.034
I'm supposed
to fly out tomorrow.

54:11.068 --> 54:13.862
And are you feeling
a little less anxious?

54:13.896 --> 54:14.862
About flying,

54:14.896 --> 54:17.241
or about the future
of Connor Airlines?

54:17.275 --> 54:18.758
I don't know.
Pick one.

54:20.068 --> 54:21.689
Well, it might be because of
your little push today,

54:21.724 --> 54:24.172
but I think I'm finally
starting to realize

54:24.206 --> 54:27.965
how to deal with my anxiety
in a more healthy way.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.379
I'm glad to hear it.

54:29.413 --> 54:31.034
Before you go back,

54:31.068 --> 54:33.724
I do have to get something
off my chest.

54:35.206 --> 54:37.379
Hank. Hi.

54:37.413 --> 54:39.689
I will take one of
your finest hot cocoas

54:39.724 --> 54:41.344
and a black coffee
for the gentleman.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.551
Actually, cocoa sounds good.

54:45.758 --> 54:46.724
Thank you.

54:46.758 --> 54:48.344
Thanks, Hank.

54:48.379 --> 54:49.517
Here you go.

54:49.551 --> 54:51.310
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

54:51.344 --> 54:52.586
And we're all ready

54:52.620 --> 54:54.413
to bring enough cocoa
for Santa's Flight on Thursday.

54:55.689 --> 54:57.344
Great.

54:57.379 --> 54:58.379
Thanks, Hank.

55:00.724 --> 55:01.655
Am I hearing things,

55:01.689 --> 55:03.068
or did he just say
"Santa's Flight"?

55:03.103 --> 55:05.000
Because I specifically recall
canceling that.

55:05.034 --> 55:07.034
Yes, and that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

55:07.068 --> 55:09.413
I agreed
to cancel Santa's Flight.

55:09.448 --> 55:11.551
But then Charlie and I
canvassed the community.

55:11.586 --> 55:14.379
We found businesses
to sponsor the event.

55:14.413 --> 55:15.689
It is a win-win for everyone.

55:15.724 --> 55:16.862
Then why didn't you tell me
about it

55:16.896 --> 55:17.931
instead of going behind my back?

55:19.206 --> 55:22.344
Because you shut me down
at the mere mention of it,

55:22.379 --> 55:23.586
so I figured it wouldn't
make a difference.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.379
I have a responsibility
to Connor Airlines.

55:26.931 --> 55:28.413
How do you expect me
to make you my VP

55:28.448 --> 55:29.448
if I can't even trust you?

55:32.620 --> 55:33.620
Good night, Jenny.

55:44.862 --> 55:46.896
There's a face
that sank a thousand ships.

55:48.758 --> 55:49.862
Did Matt find out about us

55:49.896 --> 55:51.517
trying to, you know,
save Santa's Flight?

55:53.965 --> 55:55.000
How'd it go?

55:56.068 --> 55:57.206
Let's just say

55:57.241 --> 55:59.206
I will not be winning December's
employee of the month.

56:00.482 --> 56:01.448
Well, now what do we do?

56:01.482 --> 56:03.689
I'm open to any ideas.

56:03.724 --> 56:04.896
I'm probably going to get fired,

56:04.931 --> 56:07.206
and Santa's Flight
seems to be on life support.

56:07.241 --> 56:09.137
That's a bit
of a negative perspective.

56:09.172 --> 56:10.517
Right now is exactly the time

56:10.551 --> 56:11.724
we should be stepping up
to the plate.

56:11.758 --> 56:13.068
Yeah, Charlie's right, Jenny.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.379
At this point,
we've got nothing to lose.

56:14.413 --> 56:15.310
A Channel 8 news van

56:15.344 --> 56:16.551
is waiting outside
to interview you

56:16.586 --> 56:17.724
for the morning broadcast.

56:17.758 --> 56:20.517
So you can either
sit here and mope

56:20.551 --> 56:22.931
or show 'em what you do best.

56:29.206 --> 56:31.551
This is such a passion project
for you, Jenny.

56:31.586 --> 56:33.344
What makes Santa's Flight
so special?

56:33.379 --> 56:35.689
It's a way of giving back
to those in need

56:35.724 --> 56:38.551
at a time when the world
really needs human kindness

56:38.586 --> 56:39.551
now more than ever.

56:39.586 --> 56:41.827
But this is personal
to you, isn't it?

56:41.862 --> 56:44.517
Yes, very much so.

56:44.551 --> 56:45.896
My mother started the tradition

56:45.931 --> 56:47.551
back when she was
the guiding force

56:47.586 --> 56:48.586
at Sundancer Airlines.

56:48.620 --> 56:51.344
And my mom taught
my whole family

56:51.379 --> 56:52.517
an important lesson

56:52.551 --> 56:54.517
about the true meaning
of Christmas.

56:54.551 --> 56:55.862
Until now,

56:55.896 --> 56:58.896
this event was sponsored
entirely by Sundancer Airlines.

56:58.931 --> 57:01.068
But I'm hearing rumors
you're planning a charity night

57:01.103 --> 57:03.068
to fund Santa's Flight.

57:03.103 --> 57:04.965
Why now are you seeking
private donations

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
to keep this going?

57:07.344 --> 57:08.275
Because...

57:11.689 --> 57:13.103
because we can no longer
do it alone.

57:14.068 --> 57:15.862
I don't like
having to ask people for help.

57:15.896 --> 57:17.275
Nobody does.

57:18.862 --> 57:20.241
But we don't have a choice.

57:21.827 --> 57:23.931
And it's all
for the kids, right?

57:25.068 --> 57:27.034
And just like the good folks
in Bedford Falls

57:27.068 --> 57:28.551
rallied around George Bailey

57:28.586 --> 57:30.448
in "It's a Wonderful Life",

57:30.482 --> 57:32.724
we are turning to the good folks
in Snowflake

57:32.758 --> 57:35.103
to help keep Santa's Flight
on course.

57:35.137 --> 57:36.344
"No man is a failure

57:36.379 --> 57:37.344
if he's got friends."

57:37.379 --> 57:39.689
Exactly.

57:39.724 --> 57:41.000
Santa's Flight
could use a few more.

57:48.068 --> 57:49.137
Mr. Connor?

57:49.172 --> 57:50.241
It's Matt.

57:54.655 --> 57:56.931
Nice speech out there, kiddo.

57:56.965 --> 57:58.137
Your mom would be so proud.

57:58.172 --> 58:00.724
Thanks, Dad.

58:00.758 --> 58:02.137
Now the only thing
on my to-do list

58:02.172 --> 58:04.034
is to write
my resignation letter.

58:04.068 --> 58:05.068
That won't be necessary.

58:07.482 --> 58:10.034
To echo your dad,

58:10.068 --> 58:11.206
Jenny, that was
an incredible speech

58:11.241 --> 58:13.000
you just gave out there.

58:13.034 --> 58:14.344
I spoke the truth.

58:15.931 --> 58:16.931
Frankly, I'm surprised

58:16.965 --> 58:17.896
you didn't leap
at the opportunity

58:17.931 --> 58:19.724
to throw a certain
hopeless pragmatic

58:19.758 --> 58:20.862
under the bus.

58:21.862 --> 58:22.965
For what it's worth, Matt,

58:23.000 --> 58:24.206
I should've been honest
with you from the start.

58:24.241 --> 58:25.448
No. You were right.

58:25.482 --> 58:27.275
In the mindset
I was in from the start,

58:27.310 --> 58:28.275
I would've just shut you down.

58:29.275 --> 58:32.034
But luckily for me,
and for you,

58:32.068 --> 58:34.448
I just got off the phone
with Mr. Connor,

58:34.482 --> 58:35.689
and I managed to convince him

58:35.724 --> 58:36.689
that this charity effort

58:36.724 --> 58:38.206
could generate
a lot of free press.

58:38.241 --> 58:39.827
Not to mention some goodwill.

58:39.862 --> 58:42.448
So Santa's Flight
isn't canceled?

58:43.448 --> 58:44.931
Not if we can find
a way to save it.

58:45.758 --> 58:47.275
That's great.

58:48.517 --> 58:50.379
"We"?

58:50.413 --> 58:51.344
Wow, that is...

58:51.379 --> 58:52.655
It's strange
to hear you say that.

58:52.689 --> 58:54.379
Well, don't you think it's time

58:54.413 --> 58:55.379
to find out
what we're all capable of

58:55.413 --> 58:56.413
working together?

58:58.206 --> 58:59.551
You're on.

59:02.482 --> 59:04.448
Okay, guys, let's do it!

59:04.482 --> 59:06.551
Whoo!

59:06.586 --> 59:07.931
Santa's Flight is back on!

59:11.931 --> 59:13.448
Whoo!

59:13.965 --> 59:15.310
Hi, Ann.

59:15.344 --> 59:16.896
Perfect timing, Jenny.

59:16.931 --> 59:19.034
I was just putting
some of the toy donations aside.

59:19.068 --> 59:20.344
This is a decent start.

59:20.379 --> 59:21.896
Well, with hopefully
much more to come

59:21.931 --> 59:23.689
after the benefit concert.

59:23.724 --> 59:24.655
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

59:24.689 --> 59:25.689
Thanks, Ann.

59:27.206 --> 59:29.551
Okay, are you ready
for some serious business?

59:29.586 --> 59:31.000
So very serious.

59:34.931 --> 59:36.172
Looks just like you.

59:36.206 --> 59:39.896
Oh, I wonder if Ann carries
businessman action figures.

59:39.931 --> 59:41.793
We could call them
"the Bottom Liners".

59:43.379 --> 59:44.586
What was your favorite game
growing up?

59:44.620 --> 59:46.206
Monopoly.

59:47.620 --> 59:48.896
What about you?

59:48.931 --> 59:49.896
Um...

59:49.931 --> 59:51.724
Game of Life.

59:51.758 --> 59:53.068
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

59:53.103 --> 59:54.034
I seem to remember

59:54.068 --> 59:55.517
a financial element
to that strategy.

59:55.551 --> 59:56.827
Yes.

59:56.862 --> 59:58.413
Whoever ended up
with the most money won,

59:58.448 --> 59:59.413
but I always imagined

59:59.448 --> 1:00:01.310
I'd grow up to be
a rich philanthropist.

1:00:01.344 --> 1:00:03.310
-Is that so?
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:03.344 --> 1:00:04.551
The Beckett Foundation

1:00:04.586 --> 1:00:06.931
for Girls Who Dreamed
They Could Fly.

1:00:06.965 --> 1:00:09.379
Well, you certainly
realized your dream.

1:00:09.413 --> 1:00:11.379
And what did you
first dream about being

1:00:11.413 --> 1:00:12.413
when you were little?

1:00:13.827 --> 1:00:16.137
Believe it or not, a teacher.

1:00:16.172 --> 1:00:17.896
A teacher? Really?

1:00:17.931 --> 1:00:19.413
-Yes.
-Oh.

1:00:19.448 --> 1:00:20.931
I always sort of envied

1:00:20.965 --> 1:00:24.241
their ability to inspire
and mold young minds.

1:00:24.275 --> 1:00:26.137
One part of business
I actually really enjoy

1:00:26.172 --> 1:00:27.931
is mentoring some of
the younger employees.

1:00:29.379 --> 1:00:30.931
Just out of curiosity,

1:00:30.965 --> 1:00:32.758
did you ever want to have kids?

1:00:35.275 --> 1:00:36.931
Maybe one day.

1:00:39.896 --> 1:00:40.896
Oh, look.

1:00:42.241 --> 1:00:43.172
You're kidding.

1:00:43.206 --> 1:00:46.000
Two large specials, please.

1:00:50.448 --> 1:00:51.758
I never knew charity
was such hard work.

1:00:51.793 --> 1:00:53.724
But it feels
really good, right?

1:00:54.827 --> 1:00:55.862
Actually, there is one thing.

1:00:55.896 --> 1:00:57.137
Oh, I should have figured

1:00:57.172 --> 1:00:58.862
it would be
a working coffee break.

1:00:58.896 --> 1:01:00.448
And that's where you're wrong.

1:01:01.965 --> 1:01:03.068
Go ahead.

1:01:03.103 --> 1:01:04.620
-What?
-Open it.

1:01:12.068 --> 1:01:13.931
I snagged these from Ann
when you weren't looking.

1:01:15.655 --> 1:01:16.724
Harriet is for you.

1:01:16.758 --> 1:01:17.689
Harriet.

1:01:17.724 --> 1:01:19.482
Named after Harriet Quimby,

1:01:19.517 --> 1:01:20.793
the first female pilot

1:01:20.827 --> 1:01:23.241
to be licensed
in the United States.

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:24.275
Okay.

1:01:25.517 --> 1:01:27.724
Oh, and who is this?

1:01:30.068 --> 1:01:31.034
Why don't you do the honors?

1:01:32.448 --> 1:01:33.482
Oh.

1:01:33.517 --> 1:01:34.482
Lindbergh.

1:01:34.517 --> 1:01:36.000
Charles Lindbergh.

1:01:37.586 --> 1:01:38.689
Classic.

1:01:42.517 --> 1:01:44.172
Hey there, Harriet.

1:01:44.206 --> 1:01:47.206
I'm thinking about
starting my own airline.

1:01:47.241 --> 1:01:48.034
Are you in?

1:01:48.068 --> 1:01:50.206
Oh, I'm not so sure.

1:01:50.241 --> 1:01:53.724
You seem bossy
and controlling.

1:01:53.758 --> 1:01:58.241
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
stubborn and opinionated.

1:01:58.275 --> 1:01:59.758
I beg your pardon?

1:01:59.793 --> 1:02:00.965
Hey, I am not stubborn.

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:01.965
I am passionate,

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.206
and there's a difference.

1:02:03.241 --> 1:02:04.620
Yeah, well, you never had
an opinion you didn't share.

1:02:04.655 --> 1:02:06.931
That's because
most of the time, I'm right.

1:02:21.206 --> 1:02:23.000
Looks like we're getting
quite the turnout.

1:02:23.034 --> 1:02:24.000
Uh-huh.

1:02:24.034 --> 1:02:25.931
♪ Gloria...

1:02:25.965 --> 1:02:28.965
Ah, folks in Snowflake
really stick together.

1:02:30.172 --> 1:02:31.344
And not to mention

1:02:31.379 --> 1:02:34.482
a certain former
buttoned-up Portlander as well.

1:02:34.517 --> 1:02:36.206
I know you two butt heads,

1:02:36.241 --> 1:02:37.172
but in some ways,

1:02:37.206 --> 1:02:40.068
you're more alike
than you care to admit.

1:02:41.586 --> 1:02:43.586
You both think
you know it all.

1:02:44.793 --> 1:02:46.275
I do not think
I know it all.

1:02:46.310 --> 1:02:48.000
I think I know best

1:02:48.034 --> 1:02:50.034
when it comes to making
decisions about the airline.

1:02:50.068 --> 1:02:51.724
Well, that's just it, sweetie.

1:02:51.758 --> 1:02:53.862
As much as you want to believe

1:02:53.896 --> 1:02:56.586
we're just answering
to a different boss,

1:02:56.620 --> 1:02:58.827
this is Connor Airlines now.

1:02:58.862 --> 1:02:59.862
It's no longer your burden

1:02:59.896 --> 1:03:01.034
to try and protect

1:03:01.068 --> 1:03:02.862
what your mom
and your grandma started.

1:03:04.517 --> 1:03:05.586
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

1:03:08.137 --> 1:03:13.413
♪ In excelsis Deo...

1:03:22.758 --> 1:03:23.896
Okay, thank you, everyone,

1:03:23.931 --> 1:03:26.310
but doubly thank you
for coming out tonight

1:03:26.344 --> 1:03:28.448
in support of Santa's Flight.

1:03:32.344 --> 1:03:33.896
Now I'm going to take
a little bit of an eggnog break,

1:03:33.931 --> 1:03:35.896
but the Silver Wings
are going to stick around.

1:03:35.931 --> 1:03:38.413
So come on and join us all
on the dance floor.

1:03:44.551 --> 1:03:46.068
How's the lonely hearts club?

1:03:46.103 --> 1:03:47.379
The poor thing.

1:03:47.413 --> 1:03:48.896
She's practically
been sending up smoke signals

1:03:48.931 --> 1:03:50.310
half the night
to get your dad's attention.

1:03:50.344 --> 1:03:53.137
Hey, I've got an idea.

1:03:53.172 --> 1:03:54.379
Follow my lead.

1:03:55.965 --> 1:03:57.068
Hey, Dad,

1:03:57.103 --> 1:03:58.482
do you mind helping us
get this benefit into gear?

1:03:58.517 --> 1:03:59.758
People are going
to start drifting out

1:03:59.793 --> 1:04:01.034
if we don't...

1:04:01.068 --> 1:04:02.068
make something happen.

1:04:02.103 --> 1:04:04.965
You want me
to barricade the door?

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.068
More like join us
on the dance floor?

1:04:07.103 --> 1:04:09.896
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1:04:09.931 --> 1:04:11.172
I'm not much of a dancer.

1:04:11.206 --> 1:04:14.068
Hey, neither are we,
but it's all for charity.

1:04:14.103 --> 1:04:15.551
Come on, Frank.

1:04:15.586 --> 1:04:18.344
You might even surprise yourself
and have some fun.

1:04:18.379 --> 1:04:20.448
And I bet Christine
would enjoy it, too.

1:04:33.758 --> 1:04:34.724
Hi, Frank.

1:04:34.758 --> 1:04:35.655
Hi, Christine.

1:04:35.689 --> 1:04:37.206
How are you?

1:04:37.241 --> 1:04:39.379
Um...

1:04:39.413 --> 1:04:41.137
you...

1:04:41.172 --> 1:04:45.034
wouldn't want to join me
out there for a dance,

1:04:45.068 --> 1:04:46.241
would you?

1:04:46.275 --> 1:04:48.413
Wow, you sure know how
to sweet talk a girl.

1:05:04.310 --> 1:05:05.482
Well, that took some work.

1:05:05.517 --> 1:05:06.724
It did.

1:05:06.758 --> 1:05:08.586
But we made it happen.

1:05:08.620 --> 1:05:10.413
Mm-hmm.

1:05:11.862 --> 1:05:13.862
They really are
so cute together.

1:05:13.896 --> 1:05:14.896
They are.

1:05:16.862 --> 1:05:18.068
Uh, Megan.

1:05:18.103 --> 1:05:19.724
Yes, Charlie?

1:05:21.068 --> 1:05:22.827
Uh...

1:05:22.862 --> 1:05:24.724
thanks so much
for making all this happen.

1:05:36.931 --> 1:05:38.413
There you are.

1:05:38.448 --> 1:05:39.551
Hi.

1:05:39.586 --> 1:05:41.034
I think it might be time
to celebrate.

1:05:41.068 --> 1:05:42.241
I don't know.

1:05:42.275 --> 1:05:43.724
Isn't it a little early?

1:05:43.758 --> 1:05:46.379
We're still over
a quarter shy of our goal.

1:05:46.413 --> 1:05:48.827
I'm not talking
about Santa's Flight.

1:05:48.862 --> 1:05:50.586
I made my official
recommendation to the board

1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:52.586
who I want to name
as my VP of Operations.

1:05:54.862 --> 1:05:56.034
And while I may have thought

1:05:56.068 --> 1:05:57.896
I wanted the position
to go to a clone of myself...

1:06:00.413 --> 1:06:01.586
it turns out

1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:03.103
a healthy degree of challenge
is good for growth.

1:06:03.137 --> 1:06:04.310
And I don't think
I'll ever meet someone

1:06:04.344 --> 1:06:05.620
who challenges me
as much as you.

1:06:09.068 --> 1:06:10.344
Wow.

1:06:10.379 --> 1:06:11.931
Now you're offering me
the VP position?

1:06:16.068 --> 1:06:17.310
I don't even know what to say.

1:06:17.344 --> 1:06:18.517
Well, don't say anything

1:06:18.551 --> 1:06:19.931
until you hear the job comes
with a slight caveat.

1:06:21.172 --> 1:06:22.931
With the rapid expansion
of Connor Airlines,

1:06:22.965 --> 1:06:24.034
the board felt adamant

1:06:24.068 --> 1:06:25.586
the position be based
out of Portland.

1:06:28.413 --> 1:06:30.620
I really went to bat for you,
but that was the compromise.

1:06:34.068 --> 1:06:35.413
So I'd have to leave Snowflake.

1:06:35.448 --> 1:06:38.241
Look, I know it's not
everything you wanted,

1:06:38.275 --> 1:06:39.448
but this could be the beginning

1:06:39.482 --> 1:06:40.896
of the new chapter
you've been thinking about.

1:06:45.448 --> 1:06:47.413
I guess I have
a big decision to make.

1:07:01.034 --> 1:07:02.758
Okay, so something
has come up

1:07:02.793 --> 1:07:05.448
that's kind of
caught me off guard.

1:07:05.482 --> 1:07:07.275
So I didn't share this
with any of you

1:07:07.310 --> 1:07:09.965
because I didn't really know
how to approach it.

1:07:12.103 --> 1:07:13.034
Okay...

1:07:13.068 --> 1:07:14.034
Christine has asked me

1:07:14.068 --> 1:07:15.689
to help her run the tavern

1:07:15.724 --> 1:07:17.206
as a partner.

1:07:22.551 --> 1:07:23.482
That's a relief.

1:07:23.517 --> 1:07:24.931
When I got your cryptic text,

1:07:24.965 --> 1:07:26.034
I thought it was
something serious.

1:07:26.068 --> 1:07:27.034
Dad, I mean,

1:07:27.068 --> 1:07:28.379
that sounds like
a great opportunity.

1:07:28.413 --> 1:07:30.448
Are you going to take her
up on it?

1:07:30.482 --> 1:07:31.931
Well, I...

1:07:31.965 --> 1:07:34.034
I mean, I haven't been
someone's business partner

1:07:34.068 --> 1:07:35.689
since...

1:07:35.724 --> 1:07:37.068
I was your mom's
business partner.

1:07:38.206 --> 1:07:41.896
And with her and Christine
being best friends, I...

1:07:41.931 --> 1:07:43.517
I just feel a little strange.

1:07:45.206 --> 1:07:46.896
Strange how?

1:07:46.931 --> 1:07:48.068
Well, I'm a little worried

1:07:48.103 --> 1:07:51.068
that Christine may have
some expectations

1:07:51.103 --> 1:07:52.862
beyond just being
business partners,

1:07:52.896 --> 1:07:55.896
and I wouldn't want
to upset you guys.

1:07:55.931 --> 1:07:57.068
Upset?

1:07:59.206 --> 1:08:00.827
You think if something
develops romantically

1:08:00.862 --> 1:08:01.827
with you and Christine,

1:08:01.862 --> 1:08:02.862
it's cheating on Mom?

1:08:04.413 --> 1:08:05.413
Oh, Dad.

1:08:05.448 --> 1:08:06.689
Dad, that's silly.

1:08:06.724 --> 1:08:09.172
I mean, Mom would want for you
what we all want.

1:08:09.206 --> 1:08:11.931
For you to have a life
filled with contentment.

1:08:13.620 --> 1:08:14.551
Really?

1:08:14.586 --> 1:08:16.517
If two people
truly love one another,

1:08:16.551 --> 1:08:18.034
all they want
is for the other to be happy.

1:08:21.517 --> 1:08:22.724
It's what we all
want for you, Dad.

1:08:26.758 --> 1:08:28.896
Okay.

1:08:28.931 --> 1:08:29.965
All right.

1:08:32.793 --> 1:08:34.862
I just read
your email to the board.

1:08:34.896 --> 1:08:35.862
Is it true?

1:08:35.896 --> 1:08:37.310
Did you reverse
your recommendation

1:08:37.344 --> 1:08:39.241
to move headquarters to Helena?

1:08:39.275 --> 1:08:41.344
You presented
a strong argument,

1:08:41.379 --> 1:08:42.344
and they agreed.

1:08:42.379 --> 1:08:43.586
However, the VP job

1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:45.000
will still be based
out of Portland,

1:08:45.034 --> 1:08:46.000
and if you accept the position,

1:08:46.034 --> 1:08:47.034
you need to realize

1:08:47.068 --> 1:08:48.344
that sometimes you win,

1:08:48.379 --> 1:08:49.344
and sometimes you lose.

1:08:50.896 --> 1:08:52.758
What is this?

1:08:52.793 --> 1:08:53.758
The final cost analysis.

1:08:53.793 --> 1:08:55.068
We have no choice

1:08:55.103 --> 1:08:56.482
but to make some cuts
in personnel

1:08:56.517 --> 1:08:58.758
by combining
marketing departments.

1:08:58.793 --> 1:08:59.931
You want to lay off Charlie.

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.206
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1:09:02.241 --> 1:09:03.206
But I don't expect you
to be the one

1:09:03.241 --> 1:09:04.206
to break the news.

1:09:04.241 --> 1:09:06.275
No. No, it needs
to come from me.

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:08.931
I know Charlie's heart

1:09:08.965 --> 1:09:10.172
hasn't been in the job
for a while.

1:09:10.206 --> 1:09:12.034
From time to time,
he lets things slide,

1:09:12.068 --> 1:09:15.172
and until now,
I've turned a blind eye.

1:09:16.241 --> 1:09:18.068
Does that mean you're accepting
the VP position?

1:09:22.344 --> 1:09:24.241
As hard as it is
to move away from my family...

1:09:26.896 --> 1:09:28.896
I can't turn down
this kind of opportunity.

1:09:28.931 --> 1:09:30.517
Are you sure?

1:09:30.551 --> 1:09:33.448
Sundancer's part
of a new family now.

1:09:33.482 --> 1:09:34.586
And we can either grow with it

1:09:34.620 --> 1:09:37.379
or move on
to something different.

1:09:38.862 --> 1:09:40.206
On a more positive note,

1:09:40.241 --> 1:09:42.448
where are we on sponsors
with Santa's Flight?

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:45.482
We had such a strong turnout
with the benefit last night,

1:09:45.517 --> 1:09:47.724
but we are cutting it close.

1:09:47.758 --> 1:09:49.482
With the midnight deadline
looming,

1:09:49.517 --> 1:09:51.862
I just can't help but feel
like I haven't done enough.

1:09:51.896 --> 1:09:55.551
Jenny, everyone put in 110%.

1:09:55.586 --> 1:09:57.655
All we can do now
is stay positive

1:09:57.689 --> 1:09:59.241
and see what happens.

1:10:12.241 --> 1:10:13.310
Frank,

1:10:13.344 --> 1:10:16.034
are you moonlighting
at the local flower shop?

1:10:16.068 --> 1:10:19.344
Well, these are for you.

1:10:20.344 --> 1:10:22.000
I feel that
I may have come off

1:10:22.034 --> 1:10:23.862
as a little hesitant

1:10:23.896 --> 1:10:25.413
when you asked me
to come work with you.

1:10:25.448 --> 1:10:28.413
And you were hoping
that'll take the sting off?

1:10:30.620 --> 1:10:32.000
Actually, I'm here

1:10:32.034 --> 1:10:34.724
because I'm hoping
that your offer still stands

1:10:34.758 --> 1:10:36.931
to come in as a partner
at the tavern.

1:10:36.965 --> 1:10:37.896
Mm-hmm.

1:10:37.931 --> 1:10:40.758
Okay.

1:10:40.793 --> 1:10:42.206
Well, then before I accept,

1:10:42.241 --> 1:10:43.689
I have just
one important question.

1:10:46.206 --> 1:10:49.793
What is the restaurant's policy
on co-workers dating?

1:10:52.068 --> 1:10:54.689
We don't have a policy.

1:10:55.931 --> 1:10:58.206
Why do you ask?

1:10:58.241 --> 1:11:04.517
Well, I should warn you
that I may be a little rusty

1:11:04.551 --> 1:11:07.965
because I forgot
to give you this the other day.

1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:17.241
Maybe you're not
so rusty after all.

1:11:30.241 --> 1:11:31.206
Yes!

1:11:31.241 --> 1:11:33.586
Oh, my gosh,
we've reached our goal.

1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:35.206
Mom! Come and take
a look at this.

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:37.620
Congratulations, everyone.

1:11:37.655 --> 1:11:38.586
We did it!

1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:40.448
Cheers!

1:11:40.482 --> 1:11:43.000
Santa's Flight officially
takes flight tomorrow.

1:11:43.034 --> 1:11:44.241
Thank you, all,

1:11:44.275 --> 1:11:46.724
from the bottom of my heart
for all of your hard work.

1:11:46.758 --> 1:11:48.517
This would not
have been possible

1:11:48.551 --> 1:11:50.655
without each
and every one of you.

1:11:50.689 --> 1:11:51.689
Cheers.

1:11:54.068 --> 1:11:55.137
O ye of little faith.

1:11:55.172 --> 1:11:57.344
Personally, I always knew
we'd reach our goal.

1:11:57.379 --> 1:11:59.344
Yeah, barely.

1:11:59.379 --> 1:12:01.206
If it wasn't for that
last-minute anonymous donation,

1:12:01.241 --> 1:12:02.137
we would be cooked.

1:12:02.172 --> 1:12:03.413
Well, hold on.

1:12:03.448 --> 1:12:05.413
We still had six hours
until our midnight deadline.

1:12:05.448 --> 1:12:08.137
I suggest we take
whatever extra we make

1:12:08.172 --> 1:12:10.586
and roll it over into
next year's Santa's Flight.

1:12:10.620 --> 1:12:11.586
Actually,

1:12:11.620 --> 1:12:13.034
now that the board has seen

1:12:13.068 --> 1:12:14.344
we can make this program
a success,

1:12:14.379 --> 1:12:18.103
Connor Airlines has decided
to place donation stations

1:12:18.137 --> 1:12:20.034
outside our terminals
for travelers

1:12:20.068 --> 1:12:21.241
right after
Thanksgiving holiday.

1:12:21.275 --> 1:12:23.517
And if we're ever
shy of our goal,

1:12:23.551 --> 1:12:26.034
Connor Airlines
will cover the difference

1:12:26.068 --> 1:12:28.689
so Santa's Flight
never gets grounded.

1:12:28.724 --> 1:12:29.689
To Santa's Flight!

1:12:29.724 --> 1:12:30.827
To Santa's Flight.

1:12:30.862 --> 1:12:31.862
To Santa's Flight!

1:12:33.586 --> 1:12:34.689
Matt, that is...

1:12:34.724 --> 1:12:35.931
that is
such a generous gesture.

1:12:37.689 --> 1:12:38.862
Oh, wait, I think you forgot

1:12:38.896 --> 1:12:41.931
to run it up the flagpole
to your new VP.

1:12:41.965 --> 1:12:42.965
Maybe we should take a meeting.

1:12:47.068 --> 1:12:48.413
Okay, see you in a bit.

1:12:50.965 --> 1:12:52.724
Hey, Meg.

1:12:52.758 --> 1:12:53.724
I was thinking,

1:12:53.758 --> 1:12:55.068
now that Dad's moving on

1:12:55.103 --> 1:12:56.517
and Santa's Flight
is back on track,

1:12:56.551 --> 1:12:58.241
that maybe you want
to go celebrate.

1:12:59.413 --> 1:13:00.620
I would.

1:13:00.655 --> 1:13:02.275
It's just Ann invited me
for a girls' night.

1:13:06.103 --> 1:13:07.413
That's... that's great.

1:13:07.448 --> 1:13:10.620
Um, have fun.

1:13:11.965 --> 1:13:12.965
I will.

1:13:18.379 --> 1:13:19.931
When you invited me
to a wrap party,

1:13:19.965 --> 1:13:21.689
I was figuring something
a little more celebratory.

1:13:21.724 --> 1:13:24.000
We just have to finish
wrapping all these gifts

1:13:24.034 --> 1:13:25.000
for Santa's Flight,

1:13:25.034 --> 1:13:26.000
and I thought it could be fun.

1:13:26.034 --> 1:13:27.827
And I've done
most of them already.

1:13:27.862 --> 1:13:30.137
So...

1:13:30.172 --> 1:13:32.241
do you have any idea
who our secret donor was

1:13:32.275 --> 1:13:33.482
who threw us over the top?

1:13:33.517 --> 1:13:36.655
I assumed it was
one of your board members

1:13:36.689 --> 1:13:38.379
whose heart grew
three times the size

1:13:38.413 --> 1:13:40.034
when he visited Chloe's website.

1:13:42.034 --> 1:13:43.517
Uh, finger, please.

1:13:45.103 --> 1:13:46.448
Right here.

1:13:52.206 --> 1:13:53.517
Hold still.

1:13:53.551 --> 1:13:55.206
You know I'm going to need
that finger back at some point?

1:13:56.931 --> 1:13:57.931
Stay still.

1:14:09.206 --> 1:14:10.620
Hey, Hayley.

1:14:10.655 --> 1:14:12.862
What's up?

1:14:12.896 --> 1:14:14.206
What kind of a problem?

1:14:14.241 --> 1:14:15.482
Um...

1:14:15.517 --> 1:14:16.482
hold on.

1:14:16.517 --> 1:14:17.689
Let me put you on speaker.

1:14:17.724 --> 1:14:20.689
The auxiliary power unit...

1:14:20.724 --> 1:14:21.586
It's completely blown.

1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:22.689
We have to ground the plane.

1:14:22.724 --> 1:14:24.206
Which plane is it?

1:14:24.241 --> 1:14:26.000
The one you're supposed
to be flying tomorrow

1:14:26.034 --> 1:14:27.551
for Santa's Flight.

1:14:29.068 --> 1:14:30.034
How long will it take to fix?

1:14:30.068 --> 1:14:31.068
The maintenance crew

1:14:31.103 --> 1:14:32.758
is short-staffed
with holiday hours.

1:14:32.793 --> 1:14:34.344
With the manpower I've got,

1:14:34.379 --> 1:14:35.758
it'll take a day.

1:14:35.793 --> 1:14:37.034
Maybe two.

1:14:37.068 --> 1:14:38.379
Okay. We're going to figure
something out,

1:14:38.413 --> 1:14:39.586
and we will call you back.

1:14:40.793 --> 1:14:42.172
Um, what do we do now?

1:14:42.206 --> 1:14:44.379
All of our other planes
are all in use.

1:14:45.517 --> 1:14:47.241
-What about your private plane?
-It seats eight people, max.

1:14:47.275 --> 1:14:49.413
Well then, can't we just

1:14:49.448 --> 1:14:50.965
cancel one of our other flights
for tomorrow

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.068
to make this happen?

1:14:52.103 --> 1:14:53.862
It's not possible, Jenny.
It's Christmas weekend.

1:14:53.896 --> 1:14:55.931
Well, we can't just give up.

1:14:55.965 --> 1:14:57.862
Who says I'm giving up?

1:14:57.896 --> 1:14:59.689
We just have to come up
with a practical solution.

1:14:59.724 --> 1:15:00.724
Right.

1:15:00.758 --> 1:15:02.310
Practical.

1:15:02.344 --> 1:15:03.896
So what do you suggest, hmm?

1:15:03.931 --> 1:15:06.448
Some half-hearted gift exchange
in an airplane hangar?

1:15:09.172 --> 1:15:10.620
What else
would you have me do, Jenny?

1:15:11.724 --> 1:15:13.103
I can't make something happen
that's beyond my control.

1:15:13.137 --> 1:15:14.103
I still have to answer
to the board.

1:15:14.137 --> 1:15:15.206
Oh, right.

1:15:15.241 --> 1:15:16.655
You know, Matt,
I am not naive.

1:15:16.689 --> 1:15:17.724
I know the only reason

1:15:17.758 --> 1:15:20.034
you and your precious board
agreed to help

1:15:20.068 --> 1:15:21.448
was for all the good press
you could get

1:15:21.482 --> 1:15:22.551
for Connor Airways.

1:15:24.965 --> 1:15:27.172
Well, the bottom line is
I still have a business to run.

1:15:28.827 --> 1:15:30.034
But I can't believe

1:15:30.068 --> 1:15:31.758
you really think that's why
I came aboard to help.

1:15:31.793 --> 1:15:34.034
Honestly, Matt, I don't know
what to think anymore.

1:15:35.275 --> 1:15:37.793
But what I do know

1:15:37.827 --> 1:15:39.379
is that I do
my best thinking alone.

1:15:40.586 --> 1:15:41.724
Excuse me.

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.448
I messed up.

1:16:03.482 --> 1:16:04.655
Hey, Matt and I got in a fight,

1:16:04.689 --> 1:16:07.034
and he's probably
on his way back to Portland

1:16:07.068 --> 1:16:08.379
to hire a new VP,

1:16:08.413 --> 1:16:09.413
and we worked so hard,

1:16:09.448 --> 1:16:12.068
and it's all falling apart.

1:16:12.103 --> 1:16:13.586
And with the plane downed,

1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:16.068
I have no choice
but to cancel Santa's Flight.

1:16:16.103 --> 1:16:17.620
I didn't want to disappoint
all those kids...

1:16:19.344 --> 1:16:21.241
but I will call
all the donors in the morning,

1:16:21.275 --> 1:16:23.965
and let them know
that Santa's Flight is off.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.379
I'm sorry.

1:16:32.275 --> 1:16:33.586
Yes.

1:16:33.620 --> 1:16:36.931
Yes, Mr. Connor,
I know I'm asking for a miracle.

1:16:36.965 --> 1:16:40.172
But right now, "can't"
is not in my vocabulary.

1:16:46.034 --> 1:16:47.344
Then tell the board

1:16:47.379 --> 1:16:49.448
they can start looking
for a new CEO.

1:17:01.517 --> 1:17:03.137
Hey, sweetie.

1:17:03.172 --> 1:17:05.241
Wait, what are you guys
doing here so early?

1:17:05.275 --> 1:17:06.241
Here to see you.

1:17:06.275 --> 1:17:08.413
I appreciate it,

1:17:08.448 --> 1:17:09.517
but I doubt there's anything

1:17:09.551 --> 1:17:10.827
either of you could
say to cheer me up.

1:17:10.862 --> 1:17:12.620
Come on, sis.
It's not that bad.

1:17:19.551 --> 1:17:20.551
I took one of the collectors

1:17:20.586 --> 1:17:22.379
up on their offer
to buy Mom's pin.

1:17:23.206 --> 1:17:24.586
Wait...
you're the anonymous donor?

1:17:26.551 --> 1:17:28.551
I had to.

1:17:28.586 --> 1:17:29.931
For Mom's legacy.

1:17:29.965 --> 1:17:31.827
But it turns out
it was all for nothing.

1:17:31.862 --> 1:17:33.551
I was just going
to call all the families

1:17:33.586 --> 1:17:34.827
to let them know
today is canceled.

1:17:34.862 --> 1:17:36.206
I didn't have the heart
to do it last night.

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:39.034
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't,

1:17:39.068 --> 1:17:40.068
because you would have had
to call them all back again

1:17:40.103 --> 1:17:41.068
this morning.

1:17:41.103 --> 1:17:42.241
What?

1:17:42.275 --> 1:17:43.724
That's why we're here.

1:17:43.758 --> 1:17:46.344
While Matt's jet
may not have been big enough

1:17:46.379 --> 1:17:48.068
to host Santa's Flight,

1:17:48.103 --> 1:17:49.379
he did use it to fly in

1:17:49.413 --> 1:17:51.137
a secondary maintenance crew
last night.

1:17:51.172 --> 1:17:52.172
He did?

1:17:52.206 --> 1:17:53.241
Mm-hmm.

1:17:53.275 --> 1:17:54.758
Wait, the board
agreed to do that?

1:17:55.862 --> 1:17:57.448
He put his job on the line.

1:17:57.482 --> 1:17:59.586
And that crew
worked all through the night...

1:17:59.620 --> 1:18:02.620
And Santa's Flight plane
is ready for takeoff.

1:18:02.655 --> 1:18:04.068
What?

1:18:04.103 --> 1:18:05.620
I can't believe it.

1:18:06.586 --> 1:18:07.862
I have to get the flight ready.

1:18:09.137 --> 1:18:10.068
Come on in,
buckle your seat belts,

1:18:10.103 --> 1:18:11.724
put your bags in the overheads,

1:18:11.758 --> 1:18:15.379
and, okay, welcome, everyone,
to Santa's Flight.

1:18:17.896 --> 1:18:19.206
Merry Christmas to everyone,

1:18:19.241 --> 1:18:20.758
and a very important question.

1:18:20.793 --> 1:18:22.103
Anybody here
on Santa's good list this year?

1:18:23.896 --> 1:18:26.034
Okay, that is a lot of hands.

1:18:26.068 --> 1:18:28.241
Uh, Chloe,
can we get the big basket?

1:18:28.275 --> 1:18:29.551
Hello, everyone,

1:18:29.586 --> 1:18:31.068
and welcome to Santa's Flight.

1:18:31.103 --> 1:18:33.517
We are thrilled
to have you on board today.

1:18:33.551 --> 1:18:35.482
So, everyone,
buckle your seat belts,

1:18:35.517 --> 1:18:36.586
because we're off.

1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:38.448
Here we go!

1:18:43.827 --> 1:18:46.034
And now, lunch will be served.

1:18:49.689 --> 1:18:50.931
Hi, folks.

1:18:51.931 --> 1:18:52.862
Great job.

1:18:52.896 --> 1:18:54.241
Hi, everybody.

1:18:54.275 --> 1:18:55.586
Happy holidays.

1:18:55.620 --> 1:18:57.793
Hi, kiddos.

1:18:57.827 --> 1:18:58.862
And look, everybody.

1:18:58.896 --> 1:18:59.862
There's Santa.

1:18:59.896 --> 1:19:02.586
Hello, Captain Beckett.

1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:05.103
Your ride is almost
as smooth as my sleigh.

1:19:05.137 --> 1:19:06.103
What can I say?

1:19:09.413 --> 1:19:10.344
Matt?

1:19:10.379 --> 1:19:12.241
I thought you had
a flight to catch.

1:19:12.275 --> 1:19:14.034
I did.

1:19:14.068 --> 1:19:15.068
Santa's Flight.

1:19:16.068 --> 1:19:19.517
Matt, how did you make
all of this happen?

1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:24.448
Hey, Santa?

1:19:24.482 --> 1:19:26.172
The kids are waiting for you.

1:19:26.206 --> 1:19:27.206
Duty calls.

1:19:28.965 --> 1:19:31.241
Ho-ho-ho!

1:19:31.275 --> 1:19:32.413
All right, who's ready
for some presents?

1:19:32.448 --> 1:19:34.034
I heard there are some kids here
who like presents.

1:19:34.068 --> 1:19:35.586
Do you like presents?
Do you like presents?

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:38.586
Well, lucky for you,
I have presents for everybody.

1:19:41.068 --> 1:19:42.034
♪ Are you decking the halls?

1:19:42.068 --> 1:19:43.034
Okay, everyone.

1:19:43.068 --> 1:19:44.379
Welcome to the North Pole.

1:19:44.413 --> 1:19:46.206
If you look
over to your right,

1:19:46.241 --> 1:19:47.586
you will see Santa's own
very lovely--

1:19:47.620 --> 1:19:48.620
Okay, everyone,

1:19:48.655 --> 1:19:50.517
make a disorderly line
over by Santa.

1:19:50.551 --> 1:19:51.482
Excuse me.

1:19:51.517 --> 1:19:52.586
Hey, Santa Claus.

1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:53.862
Everyone, this is
my best friend, Santa Claus.

1:19:53.896 --> 1:19:55.344
I'm Farley the Elf.

1:19:55.379 --> 1:19:56.586
It's very wonderful
to meet all of you today.

1:19:56.620 --> 1:19:58.068
Hi, everyone.

1:19:58.103 --> 1:19:59.793
Hi, Santa.

1:20:05.586 --> 1:20:08.517
♪ Till the holidays

1:20:11.275 --> 1:20:14.413
♪ Are you ready to celebrate?

1:20:14.448 --> 1:20:17.448
♪ Everyone is coming home...

1:20:18.413 --> 1:20:19.689
Focus.

1:20:20.896 --> 1:20:21.862
I did it!

1:20:21.896 --> 1:20:23.068
Mom, I won.

1:20:23.103 --> 1:20:24.275
You won.

1:20:24.310 --> 1:20:26.068
Very good.

1:20:26.103 --> 1:20:27.310
Here you go.

1:20:27.344 --> 1:20:28.931
Oh, whoa.

1:20:28.965 --> 1:20:31.620
Where are we going to put that?

1:20:33.103 --> 1:20:34.379
You can sleep in this.

1:20:34.413 --> 1:20:35.206
Hey there, mister.

1:20:35.241 --> 1:20:37.275
Wow.

1:20:37.310 --> 1:20:38.586
That's some impressive hardware.

1:20:38.620 --> 1:20:39.655
Yeah.

1:20:39.689 --> 1:20:40.862
So listen,

1:20:40.896 --> 1:20:42.241
are you really serious
about being a pilot someday?

1:20:42.275 --> 1:20:43.241
Totally.

1:20:43.275 --> 1:20:44.551
Really?

1:20:44.586 --> 1:20:46.034
Because I want to make
a deal with you

1:20:46.068 --> 1:20:47.034
to help make
your dream come true.

1:20:47.068 --> 1:20:48.172
How?

1:20:48.206 --> 1:20:49.137
For your part,

1:20:49.172 --> 1:20:50.068
all you've got to do

1:20:50.103 --> 1:20:51.137
is keep your grades up
in school.

1:20:51.172 --> 1:20:52.482
For someone as smart as you,

1:20:52.517 --> 1:20:53.655
I don't think
that's going to be a problem.

1:20:53.689 --> 1:20:54.758
Okay.

1:20:54.793 --> 1:20:56.689
And then, when you're ready
to go to college,

1:20:56.724 --> 1:20:58.137
your mom is going to call me,

1:20:58.172 --> 1:21:00.344
and Connor Airways
is going to pay your tuition.

1:21:05.241 --> 1:21:07.000
Really, Mr. Hansen,
you'll do that?

1:21:07.034 --> 1:21:08.862
Only if Benjamin
agrees to the deal.

1:21:09.620 --> 1:21:10.724
Shake on it?

1:21:12.862 --> 1:21:14.000
No. Let's hug on it.

1:21:19.068 --> 1:21:20.068
Merry Christmas, Captain.

1:21:29.379 --> 1:21:30.482
Congratulations, sis.

1:21:30.517 --> 1:21:32.275
You're going to be
the best VP of operations.

1:21:32.310 --> 1:21:35.034
Thanks, but now comes
the hard part.

1:21:35.068 --> 1:21:37.344
It's up to me
to oversee budget cuts.

1:21:37.379 --> 1:21:38.517
Don't worry about that.

1:21:38.551 --> 1:21:41.034
Hey, nobody knows
the airline biz like you.

1:21:41.068 --> 1:21:43.241
Which brings me
to my next order of business.

1:21:45.344 --> 1:21:47.344
Hey, you're twirling your...

1:21:47.379 --> 1:21:48.586
No.

1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:50.034
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, don't say another word.

1:21:50.068 --> 1:21:51.068
Okay, I'm afraid
that I have no choice.

1:21:51.103 --> 1:21:52.137
Please do not make this

1:21:52.172 --> 1:21:53.724
any harder on me
than it already is.

1:21:53.758 --> 1:21:54.827
Hey, you don't
have to do this.

1:21:54.862 --> 1:21:55.931
Yeah, actually, I do.

1:21:55.965 --> 1:21:57.310
No, no, I promise.

1:21:57.344 --> 1:21:58.724
If you let me say
what I have to say,

1:21:58.758 --> 1:21:59.896
and I promise you--

1:21:59.931 --> 1:22:01.034
Charlie, there's absolutely
nothing you could say

1:22:01.068 --> 1:22:02.000
that's going to change
what I have to say.

1:22:02.034 --> 1:22:04.137
Jenny...

1:22:04.172 --> 1:22:05.586
I quit.

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:11.068
I stand corrected.

1:22:11.103 --> 1:22:12.103
What?

1:22:15.034 --> 1:22:16.172
I had a meeting

1:22:16.206 --> 1:22:17.689
with the principal
at Snowflake Elementary.

1:22:17.724 --> 1:22:19.448
-Mm-hmm.
-And...

1:22:19.482 --> 1:22:22.034
he offered me a job
teaching music in January.

1:22:22.068 --> 1:22:23.034
Charlie, really?

1:22:25.689 --> 1:22:27.482
I thought a lot about
what you said,

1:22:27.517 --> 1:22:29.482
and you're right.

1:22:29.517 --> 1:22:31.241
I think people can change.

1:22:31.275 --> 1:22:32.275
If they have a reason.

1:22:33.379 --> 1:22:34.344
I'm happy for you.

1:22:34.379 --> 1:22:35.482
No, no.

1:22:35.517 --> 1:22:37.862
Because all of this happened
because of you.

1:22:37.896 --> 1:22:40.034
Because you've always had
my back.

1:22:40.068 --> 1:22:41.172
I don't know why,

1:22:41.206 --> 1:22:42.448
but for whatever reason,
I was too blind to see it.

1:22:44.965 --> 1:22:46.586
So I don't know
how you feel,

1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:48.896
I don't know
how things are between us,

1:22:48.931 --> 1:22:51.482
but I know that
if I don't do this now,

1:22:51.517 --> 1:22:53.241
I'm always going to regret.

1:22:53.275 --> 1:22:54.344
Megan...

1:22:56.241 --> 1:22:58.551
I...

1:22:59.689 --> 1:23:00.689
What?

1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:03.620
Will you marry me?

1:23:05.862 --> 1:23:07.068
Please?

1:23:08.068 --> 1:23:09.724
Let me show you
the man I can become.

1:23:13.206 --> 1:23:16.206
Only if you keep a big part of
that goofy guy I love so much.

1:23:16.241 --> 1:23:18.931
Yes, yes, yes!

1:23:24.448 --> 1:23:26.689
Well, I see that worked out
a little better than expected.

1:23:27.862 --> 1:23:28.862
Charlie.

1:23:31.206 --> 1:23:33.034
Oh, this is so fun!

1:23:34.793 --> 1:23:38.586
See? Christmas really is
all about the gift of giving.

1:23:39.551 --> 1:23:41.862
On that note,
this is for you.

1:23:48.931 --> 1:23:49.896
Matt, how did you...

1:23:49.931 --> 1:23:51.137
I saw it was missing

1:23:51.172 --> 1:23:52.172
and chased down the collector

1:23:52.206 --> 1:23:53.172
and convinced him
it belonged to you.

1:23:53.206 --> 1:23:55.206
Really?

1:23:55.241 --> 1:23:56.758
You must have been
pretty convincing.

1:24:00.586 --> 1:24:02.827
Matt, you have no idea
what this means to me.

1:24:03.931 --> 1:24:04.862
Actually, I do.

1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:08.586
Then you'll also understand

1:24:08.620 --> 1:24:10.310
that I cannot accept
the VP position.

1:24:13.344 --> 1:24:14.344
You belong here, don't you?

1:24:17.758 --> 1:24:20.310
I thought so, too, but no.

1:24:23.344 --> 1:24:24.551
I belong up there.

1:24:24.586 --> 1:24:27.655
Flying was always my passion,

1:24:27.689 --> 1:24:30.517
and I guess it took
someone like you

1:24:30.551 --> 1:24:31.689
to help me realize that.

1:24:32.689 --> 1:24:33.931
Then come to Portland.

1:24:33.965 --> 1:24:36.137
Take one of
my international routes.

1:24:36.172 --> 1:24:37.379
Finally start seeing the world.

1:24:37.413 --> 1:24:39.310
What? You'd do that?

1:24:39.344 --> 1:24:41.655
Yeah.

1:24:41.689 --> 1:24:43.344
Maybe I'll get to take
some time off

1:24:43.379 --> 1:24:44.551
and see the world, too.

1:24:47.517 --> 1:24:48.517
Yeah, I'd like that.

1:24:48.551 --> 1:24:50.379
Jenny, I see the way
you do things,

1:24:50.413 --> 1:24:52.275
and it's just so clear to me
what I've been missing.

1:24:53.517 --> 1:24:55.275
It can't just be
about the bottom line.

1:24:56.448 --> 1:24:58.896
Because, really,
my bottom line is...

1:25:02.310 --> 1:25:04.241
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

1:25:04.275 --> 1:25:06.000
I'm ready to find my happy.

1:25:07.310 --> 1:25:08.448
Just let go of the wheel

1:25:08.482 --> 1:25:10.103
and let somebody else
fly the plane.

1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:13.965
I got you.

1:25:15.068 --> 1:25:16.413
I was hoping
you were going to say that.
