WEBVTT

00:00.533 --> 00:01.367
We are back on the road.

00:02.469 --> 00:04.670
<i>I am throwing us head first</i>

00:04.704 --> 00:06.505
<i>into one of
the scariest places...</i>

00:06.539 --> 00:07.673
Here we go, guys.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.508
<i>...in the entire country.</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:13.379
[woman]<i> Over 6,000 souls</i>
<i>lost their lives here.</i>

00:13.413 --> 00:17.016
It was a death rate of one
body per hour passing away.

00:17.050 --> 00:20.352
Everything in here,
it just kinda moves around.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.187
[Chelsea] Whoa!
What the [bleep] is that?

00:22.222 --> 00:23.622
[Alex] What was that?

00:23.656 --> 00:26.892
[Dakota]<i> This place is known
to make people feel physically ill.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:27.993
Holy [beep]. Tanner.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.995
Pick a floor and just
sit in the dark and wait.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.163
Whoa!

00:31.197 --> 00:32.064
They'll find you.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.205
<i>My name is Dakota Laden.</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.642
<i>I'm leading my sister and
two best friends on a road trip</i>

00:43.676 --> 00:46.779
<i>exploring the most haunted
locations in America...</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:49.048
[Chelsea screaming] Oh, my God!

00:49.082 --> 00:50.182
[screaming]

00:51.384 --> 00:52.751
[Alex shouting] Oh, God!

00:53.853 --> 00:56.388
- [Dakota] Go, go, go!
- I'm freaked out.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.357
[Dakota]<i> ...experimenting</i>
<i>with fear</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:01.560
<i>and how it affects our
interaction with the paranormal.</i>

01:01.594 --> 01:05.097
<i>Each night, we separate
and sleep alone.</i>

01:05.131 --> 01:06.298
<i>The catch is</i>

01:06.332 --> 01:08.934
<i>only one of us knows
where we're going.</i>

01:19.279 --> 01:22.614
We are two days away
from leaving Las Vegas.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.249
We're getting
all our gear ready.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.885
We're getting all of our
suitcases packed.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.556
I don't know if I should be
packing sweatshirts or tank tops.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.091
It's hard to pack for a month

01:32.125 --> 01:34.093
'cause there's a lot of stuff
that I want to bring

01:34.127 --> 01:35.561
and I'm like, "Do I need that?"

01:35.595 --> 01:37.029
I'm gonna pack a kitty.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.730
- No one will even know.
- [kitten meows]

01:38.765 --> 01:42.601
You are going to make it
through this road trip alive.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.972
- [Alex] Isn't that the Ovilus?
- [Dakota] Yep, this is the Ovilus.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.632
[exhales] Wow, we're back.
[chuckles]

02:13.666 --> 02:15.167
We are back on the road.

02:15.201 --> 02:18.303
It has been a long time
since our last road trip.

02:18.338 --> 02:21.006
And we went through
a lot together.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.207
Is there somebody down there?

02:22.775 --> 02:24.009
[screaming]

02:24.043 --> 02:25.811
We saw things,
experienced things...

02:25.845 --> 02:28.947
- Hello? Hello?
- [indistinct chatter]

02:28.982 --> 02:31.350
...that I know
we will never forget.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.518
[screaming]

02:32.552 --> 02:34.353
<i>But even through
all of the rough times,</i>

02:34.387 --> 02:36.355
<i>all of the dark encounters,</i>

02:36.389 --> 02:38.757
I feel like we've barely
scratched the surface

02:38.791 --> 02:41.126
of understanding
our fear tolerance

02:41.161 --> 02:45.097
and just coming to grips
with what truly scares us.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.999
I have had a lot of time

02:47.033 --> 02:50.402
to dive into psychological
research on fear.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.070
And I've learned a lot.
I've learned a lot

02:52.105 --> 02:55.107
on just how
environmental stressors alone

02:55.141 --> 02:58.010
can alter
a person's perceptions.

02:58.044 --> 03:02.347
By manipulating our physical
environments and our senses,

03:02.382 --> 03:04.850
I believe it can make us
more susceptible

03:04.884 --> 03:07.019
to interactions
with the paranormal.

03:07.053 --> 03:10.656
And it will test our fear
more than ever before.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.992
And that is something that
I will be applying big time

03:14.027 --> 03:15.727
to this new road trip.

03:15.762 --> 03:19.264
Now, I usually like to save
the worst for last,

03:19.299 --> 03:22.834
but this trip
I am throwing us head first

03:22.869 --> 03:26.505
into one of the scariest
places in the entire country.

03:29.108 --> 03:32.644
<i>We are starting off
in Louisville, Kentucky,</i>

03:32.679 --> 03:38.517
<i>at an enormous 150,000
square-foot sanitorium.</i>

03:38.551 --> 03:41.687
<i>Built to treat those
suffering from tuberculosis,</i>

03:41.721 --> 03:44.990
<i>the treatments there were
supposed to be state of the art,</i>

03:45.024 --> 03:48.493
<i>but often times, they were
just straight up barbaric.</i>

03:48.528 --> 03:50.395
<i>So many people died here,</i>

03:50.430 --> 03:52.898
<i>that they had to make
a secret body chute</i>

03:52.932 --> 03:54.466
<i>just so that the other patients</i>

03:54.500 --> 03:58.237
<i>didn't have to see the
constant disposal of bodies.</i>

03:58.271 --> 04:02.774
<i>The energy here, I've
been told, is dark and evil.</i>

04:03.476 --> 04:04.776
<i>This place is known</i>

04:04.811 --> 04:08.113
<i>to make people
feel physically ill.</i>

04:08.147 --> 04:11.083
<i>The entities here yell at,
shove people,</i>

04:11.117 --> 04:12.784
<i>and even growl at them.</i>

04:14.621 --> 04:16.722
This is one of those
legendary locations

04:16.756 --> 04:19.424
that has terrified us
since we were very young.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.059
Chelsea, Tanner and Alex,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.262
they know
exactly what this place is.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.330
And I really think that

04:25.365 --> 04:28.000
this is going to be
a rite of passage for us.

04:36.643 --> 04:41.079
So we are officially
back on the road.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.815
- Yeah. Feels good to be back, man.
- Yeah.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.917
I just don't know
where we can go.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.488
We've already tapped into some of the
most haunted locations in the country.

04:49.522 --> 04:50.789
Alex, what about you?

04:50.823 --> 04:54.293
I'm nervous for the backlash
from the last pick that I did.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.895
Because I kinda did
all of you dirty.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.230
I really did.

04:58.264 --> 05:01.199
I don't want us to get
comfortable or complacent.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.168
So I have some things in mind

05:03.202 --> 05:05.804
that will raise
the fear levels a lot.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.639
It's gonna be tough.

05:09.375 --> 05:10.976
[Chelsea] So where
are we going right now?

05:11.010 --> 05:12.844
We've been on the road
for a long time.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.479
I know that fear of heights

05:14.514 --> 05:16.782
is one of
all of our biggest fears,

05:16.816 --> 05:19.618
and I do think that
the theme of this road trip

05:19.652 --> 05:22.554
will be taking our fear
to new heights.

05:22.588 --> 05:24.956
So I do have something
planned for us today

05:24.991 --> 05:27.025
that's gonna
get our blood pumping.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.194
- Heights?
- I thought we were done with that.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.830
Right now, we are on our way

05:31.864 --> 05:34.366
to go hot-air ballooning.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.435
- What?
- What? No way!

05:36.469 --> 05:37.636
Hot-air ballooning?

05:37.670 --> 05:38.837
[Alex] How does that even work?

05:38.871 --> 05:40.172
How a hot-air balloon

05:40.206 --> 05:42.607
is able to navigate
through the sky...

05:42.642 --> 05:43.709
How does it even land?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.344
No one else
is nervous about this?

05:52.885 --> 05:53.985
[hissing]

05:59.892 --> 06:02.194
[Chelsea laughing] Oh, my gosh.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.429
[Alex] Okay.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.865
- How're you doing? Hi, my name is Matt, guys.
- [Chelsea] Hi, Matt.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.567
[Dakota] What's up, Matt?
Nice to meet you, dude.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.402
- That's Matt, I'm Scott.
- [Dakota] Nice to meet you.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.336
Oh, my gosh.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.738
- [Matt] All right.
- This is so wild!

06:12.772 --> 06:14.039
Who here is afraid of heights?

06:14.073 --> 06:14.940
- Uh...
- [Chelsea] I am.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.541
- [Tanner] Everyone.
- I am, too.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.844
[Dakota exclaims]

06:18.878 --> 06:20.379
Oh, my God!

06:21.647 --> 06:23.515
- [Tanner] Whoa!
- [Dakota] We're up in the air!

06:23.549 --> 06:24.950
[laughs nervously]

06:25.017 --> 06:26.718
[Tanner] We're up in the air.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.787
[all chattering excitedly]

06:28.821 --> 06:30.489
[Chelsea whooping]

06:36.295 --> 06:37.696
[laughs nervously]

06:37.730 --> 06:39.131
How high up do you think
we are right now?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.899
We are about 400 feet.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.570
This is seriously taking fear
to new heights.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.571
Seriously.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.040
[Dakota] I wanna say this.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.776
Are you guys ready
for the biggest hint

06:50.810 --> 06:51.943
- I've ever given you?
- [Alex] Yeah.

06:51.978 --> 06:52.911
- [Tanner] Sure.
- Okay.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.613
The haunted location
we're going to

06:54.647 --> 06:56.848
- is in sight right now.
- What?

06:56.883 --> 06:57.783
You can see it.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.788
See that building right there?

07:02.822 --> 07:04.489
- Oh, my God.
- Dude, no way!

07:04.524 --> 07:05.857
[Dakota] Do you guys
know what that is?

07:05.892 --> 07:07.592
- That's Waverly!
- [Dakota] Yes!

07:07.627 --> 07:09.361
- What? Waverly?
- [Tanner] No way!

07:09.395 --> 07:11.129
- [Dakota] Yep.
- Are you kiddin' me?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.532
We've talked about going
to Waverly our entire lives.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.934
It's one of those locations
we've known about forever.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.270
And I felt like, you know, we've
been on the road long enough.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.104
It's time.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.408
Now that you guys know
where we're going,

07:23.443 --> 07:24.743
do you guys wanna go
read the packet?

07:24.777 --> 07:26.211
[Alex] Can we
get on the ground now?

07:36.889 --> 07:37.989
[hand brake creaks]

07:39.325 --> 07:40.492
Well...

07:40.526 --> 07:43.862
What you're about to read
is terrifying.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.498
Tanner... [sighs]
...open the packet.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.100
All right. Here we go.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.273
[both] "Waverly Hills
Sanatorium."

07:58.811 --> 08:00.178
[Tanner]<i> "It's iconic.</i>"

08:00.213 --> 08:01.713
<i>"It's legendary."</i>

08:01.747 --> 08:04.916
<i>"And it's one of the most
haunted and horrifying places"</i>

08:04.951 --> 08:07.018
<i>"in the entire United States."</i>

08:09.956 --> 08:13.058
[Dale]<i> Everything in here,</i>
<i>it just kinda moves around.</i>

08:13.092 --> 08:15.660
We see shadow people
in the daytime

08:15.695 --> 08:17.028
on security cameras

08:17.063 --> 08:19.397
and at night,
on all five floors,

08:19.432 --> 08:20.932
even the grounds outside.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.569
[Tanner] "Originally opened
in 1910"

08:24.604 --> 08:27.973
"as a simple, two-storied
tuberculosis treatment facility

08:28.007 --> 08:30.342
"designed to treat
just 50 people,

08:30.376 --> 08:33.011
"the number of patients
quickly grew."

08:33.045 --> 08:34.479
<i>"By 1926,"</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:38.016
<i>"the current five-storied
gargantuan edifice was constructed."</i>

08:39.185 --> 08:41.853
[David]<i> Tuberculosis was</i>
<i>highly contagious.</i>

08:41.888 --> 08:44.356
They didn't know what caused it.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.324
And it really was
a death sentence

08:46.359 --> 08:49.427
if you were diagnosed with TB.

08:49.462 --> 08:53.665
This building
was the forefront of research

08:53.733 --> 08:56.401
and experimentation
in the country.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.736
[Tanner] <i>Thousands of Americans</i>

08:57.770 --> 08:59.571
<i>picked up
and moved to Louisville.</i>

08:59.605 --> 09:02.307
<i>Tragically, many succumbed
to their illness</i>

09:02.341 --> 09:04.476
<i>before they could receive care.</i>

09:04.510 --> 09:06.411
<i>If one was lucky enough
to be admitted,</i>

09:06.445 --> 09:09.147
<i>they had to leave
their old life behind,</i>

09:09.181 --> 09:11.416
<i>and become a resident
on the hill.</i>

09:11.450 --> 09:13.485
[David]<i> If you were</i>
<i>a patient here</i>

09:13.519 --> 09:16.321
or you worked here,
you lived here.

09:16.355 --> 09:19.591
It was a completely
self-contained community.

09:19.625 --> 09:23.328
[Chelsea]<i> "Tuberculosis was</i>
<i>a deadly diagnosis.</i>"

09:23.362 --> 09:24.963
"And Waverly's doctors"

09:24.997 --> 09:28.433
"were constantly developing
ground-breaking,"

09:28.467 --> 09:30.969
"but often brutal treatments."

09:31.003 --> 09:33.271
[Dale]<i> They'd use air pressure</i>
<i>to collapse your lung,</i>

09:33.306 --> 09:35.240
<i>'cause they thought that
while the lung was collapsed,</i>

09:35.274 --> 09:36.908
<i>it would rest and heal itself.</i>

09:36.943 --> 09:38.376
The worst one that I'm aware of

09:38.411 --> 09:40.145
was something
called thoracoplasty.

09:40.179 --> 09:43.748
They would start the incision right
about that notch in your collar bone,

09:43.783 --> 09:45.150
come down your belly button,

09:45.184 --> 09:46.451
and start removing ribs.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.320
<i>We've been told
their mortality rate</i>

09:48.354 --> 09:51.623
<i>could be as high
as in the 90s on that one.</i>

09:51.657 --> 09:52.791
- What?
- Yeah.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.926
This just shows the desperation

09:54.961 --> 09:56.962
of how bad this was.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.630
And how they were willing to do

09:58.664 --> 10:00.699
just about anything
to try and cure it.

10:00.733 --> 10:01.566
Mm-hmm.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.438
[Chelsea]<i> "It is estimated</i>
<i>that over 6,000 souls</i>"

10:06.472 --> 10:10.041
<i>"lost their lives
inside the walls of Waverly."</i>

10:10.076 --> 10:14.412
It was a death rate of one body
per hour passing away here.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.282
[Dale]<i> If you are on the
solarium receiving air treatment,</i>

10:17.316 --> 10:20.552
you're watching a constant stream
of bodies go down the back road.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.588
And they did not
want the patients to know

10:23.623 --> 10:25.590
how many bodies were leaving.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.892
<i>So they converted
the construction tunnel</i>

10:27.927 --> 10:29.427
<i>into a body chute.</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:31.062
<i>And from there,
they'd be loading the hearses</i>

10:31.097 --> 10:33.565
<i>ambulances, train cars, depending
on where they needed to go.</i>

10:33.599 --> 10:35.567
- My God.
- Oh, I'm not looking forward to that place.

10:35.601 --> 10:36.901
[Chelsea sighs]

10:36.936 --> 10:39.871
[Chelsea] "But it wasn't just those
who succumbed to tuberculosis"

10:39.905 --> 10:41.573
"who ended up in the chute."

10:41.607 --> 10:43.908
"There were several mysterious"

10:43.943 --> 10:47.145
"and tragic employee deaths
over the years as well."

10:49.281 --> 10:53.385
"A nurse hung herself
outside room 502.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.088
"While the true origins behind
her death may never be known,"

10:57.123 --> 10:59.891
<i>"her apparition is still seen
hanging in the hallway"</i>

10:59.925 --> 11:01.259
<i>"to this day."</i>

11:02.261 --> 11:04.396
[Dale]<i> The story has changed</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

11:04.430 --> 11:05.964
<i>It has been insinuated</i>

11:05.998 --> 11:07.832
that she had gotten pregnant

11:07.867 --> 11:10.168
by a doctor who was
married to someone else.

11:10.202 --> 11:13.605
It is possible
that the baby was stillborn,

11:13.639 --> 11:15.874
and she decided
to take her own life.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.209
However, this may have
been something

11:18.244 --> 11:20.779
as dark as
an abortion gone wrong,

11:20.813 --> 11:22.514
and they staged the hanging
to cover it up.

11:26.485 --> 11:27.886
[Chelsea] "Haunted accounts."

11:27.920 --> 11:31.056
"Waverly Hills is synonymous
with paranormal activity."

11:32.591 --> 11:34.626
[Dale] Pick a floor,
doesn't matter which one,

11:34.660 --> 11:36.995
and just sit in the dark
and wait.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.398
I promise you, they'll find you.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.967
[Chelsey]<i> The only time</i>
<i>that you really need to panic</i>

11:43.002 --> 11:46.304
<i>is if all of a sudden
it becomes very hot.</i>

11:46.338 --> 11:48.940
Heat is associated with evil.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.275
That is when you know

11:50.309 --> 11:52.811
you've got something in there
that's not friendly,

11:52.845 --> 11:54.379
and it's probably time to go.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.984
[Chelsea]<i> "The most</i>
<i>active areas include</i>"

12:00.019 --> 12:02.253
"the body chute."

12:02.288 --> 12:04.756
[Chelsey]<i> I was in there</i>
<i>completely alone.</i>

12:04.790 --> 12:06.825
<i>There was something
running up the chute,</i>

12:07.259 --> 12:08.860
<i>straight at me.</i>

12:08.894 --> 12:11.262
<i>It was glowing
and it was twitching.</i>

12:11.297 --> 12:13.865
It was terrifying.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.267
I have never been that scared
in my entire life.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.572
Just growing up, when we
heard about this place,

12:20.606 --> 12:23.108
the body chute
stuck out the most to me.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.843
And I always remembered thinking

12:24.877 --> 12:27.045
I would never go in there alone.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.446
Definitely set a high bar.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.647
[Chelsea] Gosh.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.683
"The fourth floor."

12:31.717 --> 12:35.086
"Home to the operating room
and private patient rooms,"

12:35.121 --> 12:39.057
"the fourth floor is prone
to very dark energy."

12:39.091 --> 12:42.127
[Chelsey]<i> The fourth floor, it's
got a lot of permanent residents</i>

12:42.161 --> 12:45.230
that are capable of doing
a lot of physical things

12:45.264 --> 12:49.100
such as scratching,
biting, mimicking.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.469
They are incredibly intelligent.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.106
[Dakota]<i> "There have been</i>
<i>numerous apparitions seen,</i>"

12:55.141 --> 12:56.508
<i>'including that of a doctor</i>

12:56.542 --> 12:59.110
<i>"who performed
experimental surgeries.</i>

12:59.145 --> 13:01.679
"He is known to slam heavy doors

13:01.714 --> 13:03.248
"and feeds off the energy

13:03.282 --> 13:05.917
"of those who dare
to walk down the floor."

13:05.951 --> 13:08.086
"He has even
channeled one visitor"

13:08.120 --> 13:11.289
"who said, 'Bring souls.
Bring souls.'"

13:11.891 --> 13:13.057
What?

13:13.092 --> 13:15.493
If I hear something saying,
"Bring souls. Bring souls,"

13:15.528 --> 13:17.862
you bet
I'm bringing Dakota up there.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.164
[laughing]

13:21.867 --> 13:22.934
[Tanner] "The fifth floor."

13:23.803 --> 13:26.171
"The top floor
of the sanatorium,

13:26.205 --> 13:29.140
"the fifth floor was split
while in operation.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.176
"With a children's ward
on the right,"

13:31.210 --> 13:34.946
"and the ward for those whose TB
had reached their brains on the left,"

13:34.980 --> 13:37.949
"this area plagues visitors
with physical ailments."

13:39.018 --> 13:42.620
[David] The fifth floor,
and specifically room 502,

13:42.655 --> 13:44.789
has been known
to make people ill.

13:44.824 --> 13:49.460
When you walk into room 502,
and walk back out,

13:49.495 --> 13:51.963
some people get violently ill.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.666
Fifth floor is no joke.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.335
I've got like a pit in my stomach
right now just thinking about it.

13:57.369 --> 14:00.872
Every part of this building
sounds terrifying.

14:12.117 --> 14:16.521
I cannot believe you are
taking us to Waverly right now.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.656
- I know.
- Seriously.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.191
Like, I couldn't
fall asleep last night.

14:20.226 --> 14:24.796
I was like half excited
and half absolutely terrified.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.097
I don't understand it, dude.

14:26.131 --> 14:29.167
Like, we haven't been
on the road for months

14:29.235 --> 14:31.736
and we don't even get
to dip our toes back into it

14:31.770 --> 14:32.971
with an easy start.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.006
You're just throwing us
right into the pit of fire.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.307
Why?

14:36.342 --> 14:39.110
Based off the packing last
night, what are you anticipating?

14:39.144 --> 14:41.246
I'm gonna be stuck in the body
chute the whole night,

14:41.280 --> 14:43.948
I just... I feel it like, I don't
have the best luck with tunnels

14:43.983 --> 14:45.984
and that's basically just
a death tunnel.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.419
Keep thinking it,
keep feeling it.

14:48.454 --> 14:51.522
Put it out in the universe, I would
be totally okay with that happening.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.057
Yeah me too.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.760
You should be a motivational speaker
Chelsea, you're really good at this.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.128
Thank you.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.464
I have always been afraid of
this building, since I was a child.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.466
So like now that we're
actually going into,

15:01.500 --> 15:02.967
it's like you're meeting
the boogey man.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.671
I'm all about going big, I'm all
about challenging ourselves,

15:06.705 --> 15:09.073
but, like,
this is very ambitious.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.742
- [all chuckling]
- Yeah.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.011
I don't know the types of
locations you guys have picked.

15:13.045 --> 15:16.748
But the ones that I've picked, it's
not like it's gonna get easier from here.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.184
It's kinda like a plus thing maybe,
that we're starting with this first.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.920
A blessing, he says.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.765
I feel like every single location
has this spooky windy road...

15:34.833 --> 15:36.434
Deep into the woods.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.008
- Oh my God look up there.
- What?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.576
- Geez.
- No way.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.544
There it is.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.046
[all] Oh, my God!

15:50.849 --> 15:54.018
[Chelsea] I'm so scared.
I can't believe we're here.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.921
Oh, my God.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.090
Oh, my God dude, no way.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.492
Look at this.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.963
I know that we just got here, but I
genuinely don't want the night to end.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.965
I'm so amped up right now

16:06.999 --> 16:09.634
I don't know man, you wouldn't
be speaking too soon.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.938
I never thought we'll get
to see this building.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.606
And it's right in front of us.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.741
[Dakota] This is the entrance.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.010
[Chelsea] Oh, my God.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.612
Welcome to Waverly.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.248
[exhales] Unreal.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.684
Here we go guys.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.353
[Chelsea] All right.

16:30.589 --> 16:31.522
Crap.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.129
[Dakota] We set up our gear
room on the first floor.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.398
And now we are about
to start our overnight.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.100
Because this is the first stop,

16:42.134 --> 16:44.469
I think we should just go
together as a group the entire night.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.306
I hate to say it, but I really feel like we
should probably start in the body chute.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.707
Are you serious?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.409
We're starting in
the body chute?

16:51.443 --> 16:52.777
Why are you doing this to us?

16:54.413 --> 16:56.114
Check this out you guys.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.717
This door right in front of us
leads to the body chute.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.220
I thought we're gonna walk
the halls for a little bit but,

17:02.254 --> 17:04.689
guess we'll just start of
the hard way.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.062
- What.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.165
[Tanner] Oh, my goodness.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.735
Geez, it just keeps going.

17:18.504 --> 17:19.604
[objects clattering]

17:19.638 --> 17:20.972
- Sorry.
- What the [bleep] was that?

17:21.006 --> 17:22.840
- I'm so sorry.
- You okay?

17:22.875 --> 17:23.975
Totally fine.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.376
This came out of nowhere.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.678
That wall popped out of nowhere?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.881
- [all chuckling] - [Chelsea]
These are so hard to see.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.187
Oh, my gosh.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.557
- Wait, what?
- It just goes straight down.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.893
Do you guys remember how
high we were in the air balloon,

17:41.927 --> 17:45.229
we were like 500ft.
This tunnel is 500ft.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.864
[Tanner] What!

17:46.899 --> 17:51.369
All thousands of the bodies that have
died here, have been through this tunnel.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.470
Alone!

17:54.506 --> 17:56.541
[Dakota] Is there somebody
here with us?

17:56.575 --> 17:59.811
Can you make a noise,
can you show yourself for us?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.048
Okay, here's the end.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.450
It's all tarped off now.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.718
Well, basically there's a
door right behind me

18:07.753 --> 18:09.420
that's where the hearse
would pull up.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.722
Most of the times,
the patients never even knew

18:11.757 --> 18:14.125
people were dying
at the rate they were dying.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.627
[exhales]

18:16.662 --> 18:20.631
Let's walk back up, and then maybe
we just sit down and whip up the Ovilus.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.001
This is a device that has
a word database inside of it.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.604
It is believed that spirits
can manipulate the frequencies

18:26.638 --> 18:28.506
to choose whatever word
they want.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.374
Can you tell us who you are?

18:30.409 --> 18:34.078
Were you a patient here
or were you part of the staff?

18:34.113 --> 18:37.715
If you can see us right now and
hear us, can you describe us?

18:37.749 --> 18:39.584
Any one of us,
through that device.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.986
Is there anything you
wanna tell us?

18:42.554 --> 18:44.155
Or warn us about?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.225
- [indistinct noise]
- Oh!

18:47.826 --> 18:49.227
It just said girl.

18:49.261 --> 18:53.598
Wait, Alex just said describe
one of us down here and it said girl.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.733
[Alex] What the heck,
that's so creepy, Chelsea.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.702
I do not like that at all.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.203
Why did it pick Chelsea?

18:59.238 --> 19:03.474
I swear to God, if I end up
sleeping down here, I am done.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.476
In my head,
it's gonna be up to fate.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.711
Oh, I hate fate.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.048
- [swishing sound]
- [Chelsea] Oh!

19:12.718 --> 19:14.919
[Dakota] We just sat down in
the middle of the body chute.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.724
- [swishing sound]
- [Chelsea] Woah!

19:19.758 --> 19:22.426
- What the [bleep] was that?
- What was that, guys?

19:26.965 --> 19:28.900
Did something just drop
from the ceiling?

19:28.934 --> 19:30.468
That sounded like a rock.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.971
That did not just fall,
that was like flying.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.473
Almost like someone
like threw it.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.676
It almost felt like it tried to throw
it up and it rolled back down.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.345
Yeah like it was way down
there, tried to throw it up to us.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.582
Like I did hear it, afterwards,
kinda still going down.

19:44.616 --> 19:49.320
There are like lots of little rocks
on the ground everywhere here.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.890
So, it's so hard to tell if, that
was natural or paranormal.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.326
Something could have easily
fallen off the ceiling.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.594
Yeah, easily.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.796
- Weird timing.
- Really weird timing.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.400
It has been a while now,
since we have gotten anything.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.468
So we are gonna keep moving.

20:04.503 --> 20:08.039
Time to go explore the rest
of this massive building.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.909
We are going up
to the third floor.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.657
We just explored the entire
third floor.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.595
And we didn't experience any
paranormal activity.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.331
So, we are just gonna keep
moving our way up.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.566
I do not like the
fourth floor already.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.634
Bad vibes.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.569
- Yeah.
- Bad vibes.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.539
[Dakota] The fourth floor was
where the operating rooms were.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.042
It's also where some of the
patient rooms were.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.045
This is the floor that people
describe the haunting as being.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.413
Very dark.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.082
Hello.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.118
Is there anybody here?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.422
We heard that,
there was a doctor here.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.826
Can you show yourself in front
of us, so we can see you?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.731
Geez, this keeps going
and going.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.367
This is such a massive building.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.301
[Dakota] It really is.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.437
Do you guys feel like
someone is following us?

21:13.472 --> 21:14.572
Yes!

21:14.606 --> 21:17.241
It feels like we're definitely
not alone on this floor.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.209
[indistinct noise]

21:18.243 --> 21:19.944
What was that?

21:19.978 --> 21:22.913
Something literally just
dropped right behind me.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.049
- Almost sound more like footsteps.
- Did you hear?

21:25.083 --> 21:27.785
Like an additional footstep
that wasn't ours or a movement.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.321
Is something following us?

21:30.355 --> 21:31.656
It feels like it.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.658
Here, I'm gonna leave my
camera on the ground.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.259
Just stay there.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.496
I'm gonna take some pictures, because
people do see a doctor on this floor.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.942
I'm gonna take a bunch
of photographs.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.000
If you could please
show yourself to us.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.604
We wanna see you,
we wanna experience you.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.373
Can you show yourself?

21:49.408 --> 21:51.475
[camera shutter clicking]

21:51.510 --> 21:53.444
Okay, I'm gonna review these.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.845
Took a lot of photos.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.082
Nothing.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.087
Wait, go back.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.723
- Oh, weird.
- Wait what?

22:05.757 --> 22:08.392
Down the hallway there just
like a white mist.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.061
- Okay.
- [Chelsea] That's weird.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.562
That is weird.

22:11.596 --> 22:16.267
Hopefully, maybe, dust but it's
just weird, it's not in any other photo.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.536
- [Tanner] It's definitely an anomaly.
- Yeah.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.871
- Where's that in relation?
- It's right there.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.708
It's literally that, all the way
back. See that, like, the door.

22:23.742 --> 22:28.312
Let me just go, I wanna see, there
could be like an actual explanation for it.

22:28.347 --> 22:32.049
Screw this floor.
This sucks so serious.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.485
It looked like it was
standing literally right here.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.520
- Yeah, yeah.
- It was darting away.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.124
[Chelsea] Dude, that says,
the treatment room.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.292
It's like rubbed off.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.027
[Dakota] It's just
an empty room.

22:43.061 --> 22:47.064
The treatments that were done
here were incredibly invasive.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.201
So much pain was inflicted
in this room.

22:50.235 --> 22:53.471
So much pain.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.273
I mean, I hope that there's an
explanation for that

22:56.308 --> 23:00.444
like I honestly genuinely hope that, that was
like matrixing with the camera and the pixels

23:00.479 --> 23:02.446
because that's so
freaking creepy.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.749
I feel bad, whoever
has to sleep here.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.684
Oh, my gosh,
I have a stomach ache.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.454
I cannot do this, there's no way
I'm sleeping alone in this building.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.391
There's no freaking way.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.896
Hopefully the fifth floor
is a little nicer to us.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.771
Woah, oh, my gosh, guys.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.672
So we just got up to the
fifth floor.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.742
On my right side here, this is
where the children's ward was.

23:31.777 --> 23:34.445
And on the left was where,
the patients were put

23:34.479 --> 23:36.747
once the tuberculosis
reached their brain.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.016
This is said to be one of the
most haunted floors.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.785
We're just gonna walk around.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.087
Is there anybody
up here with us?

23:43.121 --> 23:45.790
Can you make a noise
to get our attention?

23:47.726 --> 23:50.761
I can't imagine being a health
care worker, up on this floor.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.864
As far as I know you're not
allowed visitation from your family.

23:53.899 --> 23:57.001
So these children are
completely alone

23:57.035 --> 24:00.371
mixed with the most severe
cases of tuberculosis...

24:00.405 --> 24:01.605
- [indistinct noise]
- What the?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.873
- [bleep]
- What was that?

24:04.142 --> 24:06.143
[Chelsea] These children are
completely alone

24:06.178 --> 24:09.880
mixed with the most severe
cases of tuberculosis...

24:09.915 --> 24:10.981
[indistinct noise]

24:11.016 --> 24:12.183
- What the [bleep]
- What was that?

24:13.251 --> 24:14.251
Hello?

24:14.886 --> 24:16.320
Is there someone there?

24:18.223 --> 24:21.392
The most severe cases
of tuberculosis...

24:21.426 --> 24:23.794
- What the [bleep]
- What was that?

24:23.829 --> 24:26.330
- It almost sounded like a...
- [all] Yeah.

24:26.364 --> 24:30.134
Like a little... even harder than that
door. But over there on the other side.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.475
We heard you make a noise.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.710
Can you do that again?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.514
Is there somebody here?
Can you do that again for us?

24:43.548 --> 24:46.317
Can you give us more verification
that there's someone here.

24:46.351 --> 24:47.418
Can you make another noise?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.221
I have a bad feeling, man.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.525
- [thudding]
- Woah, what was that?

24:54.559 --> 24:57.995
- It sounded like scratching, scraping.
- Yes.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.467
- [indistinct noise]
- Woah, what was that?

25:04.636 --> 25:07.071
Guys, what the hell was that,
seriously?

25:07.105 --> 25:10.174
Okay, first we here like
a thud, almost like a stomp.

25:10.208 --> 25:13.611
And now we're hearing like scratching
from the side we just came from.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.112
Is it coming from the middle?

25:15.146 --> 25:17.748
It sounded like it came from
one of these locked doors.

25:17.782 --> 25:19.416
Which one is room 502?

25:19.451 --> 25:20.551
501.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.419
- 506.
- 504.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.421
- This one's 502.
- No way.

25:24.456 --> 25:28.192
Right here in the middle of
both sides is room 502

25:28.226 --> 25:30.728
where the nurse allegedly
took her own life.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.430
Where people have seen her
in the room still hanging.

25:33.465 --> 25:37.201
All the noises we heard very easily
could have came from right here.

25:37.235 --> 25:40.938
I don't know man, there's just something
about this floor that just gives me

25:40.972 --> 25:42.172
the willies.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.842
Honestly, like I just...
I don't like it up here.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.077
I'm gonna ask a few questions
to the nurse and see if she's

25:47.112 --> 25:48.879
up here cause
we're hearing a lot.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.514
I just turned back on the
Ovilus.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.717
I'm gonna keep it on for the rest
of the time while we're on this floor.

25:53.785 --> 25:56.687
I'm gonna put the Ovilus
in front of room 502.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.424
Are we talking to the nurse,
is that who we're hearing?

26:00.458 --> 26:04.395
Can you give us a word to
confirm that we are talking to you?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.698
Were you the one making
noise up here?

26:07.732 --> 26:10.267
Did you stomp?
What were you tapping on?

26:12.938 --> 26:15.506
There's a lot of speculation
on whether you took your

26:15.540 --> 26:17.575
own life or this was foul play.

26:17.609 --> 26:21.111
Can you give us a word or a
message to put an end to that?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.848
- [voice over Ovilus]
- What did it say?

26:24.883 --> 26:26.850
- It said "Mommy."
- Mommy.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.185
It just said mommy.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.987
[Chelsea] One of the stories
was that she was pregnant.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.089
- Yeah.
- Yes, she was pregnant, that's the thing.

26:32.123 --> 26:33.457
She was about to be a mommy.

26:33.491 --> 26:36.627
That's so creepy,
right outside of 502.

26:36.661 --> 26:40.164
It almost validates a lot of
peoples claims about this place.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.534
Do you have anything else
you wanna say to us?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.904
Thank you for giving
us that response.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.973
Oh, what the [bleep]

26:49.007 --> 26:50.808
- I'm bleeding.
- Holy [bleep] Tanner.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.176
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me see.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.311
- Yeah, no you're bleeding, cover it up.
- Okay, we should go back.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.113
Yeah, let's go back to the
gear room

26:56.147 --> 26:58.882
and get him, like, Kleenex,
'cause we need to fix this.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.656
[Tanner] Oh, I can taste it
in my throat.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.391
We need Kleenex.

27:07.425 --> 27:09.426
Ah, yeah we need to get
him paper towels.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.395
Holy [bleep]!

27:11.429 --> 27:14.164
Here, sit down actually,
take a seat, dude.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.966
Just shove that up there.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.968
You didn't bump your nose
or anything, you just...

27:18.003 --> 27:19.870
I didn't scratch it or anything.

27:19.904 --> 27:22.539
It's just right after we're
asking all those questions.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.976
This is weird, I don't wanna say
right away that this is paranormal

27:26.011 --> 27:28.545
but all of the events
that unfolded

27:28.580 --> 27:32.149
and ending with a bloody nose, that
seems somewhat paranormal, but...

27:32.183 --> 27:33.384
It could be explainable.

27:33.418 --> 27:36.887
I mean, it could be the
weather, it could be the dryness.

27:36.921 --> 27:40.057
But man, it's unbelievable
timing if anything.

27:40.091 --> 27:43.494
Freaking weird, to have all
the places to the floor,

27:43.528 --> 27:45.262
where people like
feel physical ailments,

27:45.296 --> 27:47.097
being pushed, shoved, puke,

27:47.132 --> 27:48.499
and you get a bloody nose.

27:48.533 --> 27:51.735
I was already so scared of that
floor, I did not need anything else

27:51.770 --> 27:55.072
to make me more frightened
of that fifth floor.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.141
I honestly don't know if
anyone should go up there.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.044
I just, if you guys
don't want to

28:00.078 --> 28:02.279
we definitely don't have to
but, I know

28:02.313 --> 28:04.281
if we don't have someone
sleep up there that

28:04.315 --> 28:07.785
when I get home, and once
this trip is over

28:07.819 --> 28:10.587
and we're viewing the footage,
we're gonna be a little upset

28:10.622 --> 28:11.689
that we at least didn't try.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.958
You're right, we probably
would regret it.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.293
[Alex] I think we would.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.628
I don't know.

28:17.662 --> 28:20.464
I hate to say it, unless you
guys truly don't think we should...

28:20.498 --> 28:22.566
I feel like someone has
to sleep up there.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.103
We'll be doing this place a disservice
if we don't have someone go up there.

28:26.137 --> 28:29.473
I know it's stupid to say, but
that's why we do come here.

28:29.507 --> 28:35.045
Obviously though, 100%, whoever
sleeps up there has to be so careful.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.882
If this was paranormal, who knows what
could've happened if you were alone up there.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.285
And what else it was going
to do to you.

28:41.319 --> 28:44.221
If it's paranormal. We don't
know but it seems like it.

28:44.255 --> 28:48.125
I'm so uncomfortable. I cannot
imagine how you feel right now.

28:50.261 --> 28:51.128
[Tanner] Well, this sucks.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.899
[Dakota]<i> Unfortunately right
now, it is time for us to go to bed.</i>

28:55.934 --> 28:59.169
<i>Separated across
this massive sanatorium.</i>

28:59.204 --> 29:01.805
We believe that when
you're alone and isolated,

29:01.840 --> 29:04.208
it gives you a better chance
of experiencing

29:04.242 --> 29:06.076
the paranormal on
a more personal level.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.811
This has been
a pretty intense night

29:07.846 --> 29:10.748
and I don't think any of us are
going to have a good time at this.

29:10.782 --> 29:14.017
We've all agreed on the floor
locations for us to go sleep.

29:14.052 --> 29:16.186
We have the body chute.

29:16.221 --> 29:19.490
<i>When we were there earlier, we heard
what sounded like a rock being thrown.</i>

29:19.524 --> 29:22.526
We also got intelligent
responses on the Ovilus.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.162
And then we have
the third floor.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.564
When we were there earlier, we
didn't have anything happen to us.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.533
Then we have the fourth floor.

29:29.567 --> 29:32.002
This is where the doctor
said to haunt.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.237
When we were on
the fourth floor,

29:33.271 --> 29:35.806
it felt like we were
being followed constantly.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.009
For our final sleeping
arrangement, I hate to even say it.

29:39.043 --> 29:43.147
<i>The fifth floor. Even though Tanner
just got a bloody nose up there,</i>

29:43.181 --> 29:45.516
<i>we are still gonna make it one
of the sleeping arrangements.</i>

29:45.550 --> 29:48.552
I think it's probably
by far the scariest

29:48.586 --> 29:50.521
after Tanner just went through.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.890
So, those are
four sleeping arrangements.

29:52.924 --> 29:55.192
<i>Tanner is gonna write
those out on a piece of paper.</i>

29:55.226 --> 29:56.527
<i>And we are gonna draw.</i>

29:56.561 --> 29:59.396
<i>That's where you're gonna
sleep for the rest of the night.</i>

29:59.430 --> 30:03.567
Okay, I would draw first
and get it out of the way.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.639
Third floor.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.307
[Tanner] Oh!

30:10.341 --> 30:11.708
I feel like that's the best.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.911
- [Chelsea] I hate you.
- [Tanner]<i> I think you just lucked out.</i>

30:13.945 --> 30:15.646
[Chelsea] I literally hate you.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.716
All the sleeping arrangements are
bad, except, possibly the third floor.

30:19.751 --> 30:20.751
And, that's what I got.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.319
I'm so glad I drew first.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.154
[Tanner] All right,
on that note, I'll go second.

30:24.189 --> 30:25.923
Okay, Tanner is gonna draw.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.257
[Chelsea] All right, Tanner.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.425
Here goes nothing.

30:29.227 --> 30:30.060
[sighing]

30:33.898 --> 30:36.700
- Oh, no!
- [Dakota] What?

30:36.734 --> 30:39.403
- I got the fifth floor.
- [Chelsea] Oh!

30:40.271 --> 30:41.705
[Tanner] Holy [bleep]

30:41.739 --> 30:43.607
[Dakota]<i> Do you wanna do it?</i>
<i>You don't have to.</i>

30:45.043 --> 30:47.711
I don't wanna start the trend
that we switch up stuff.

30:47.745 --> 30:51.315
[Dakota] Everyone would understand,
if you don't wanna be up there.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.083
What do you wanna do?
It's up to you.

30:54.953 --> 30:56.253
You're gonna do it?

30:58.122 --> 30:59.056
Yeah, I'll do it.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.491
Holy crap, dude!

31:01.526 --> 31:03.594
This is a once in a life
opportunity.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.129
And, if this is what fate wants.

31:06.164 --> 31:09.566
This is what we have to do. Just
gonna toughen it out and do it.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.970
You're strong for taking
this on. Like, I would not.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.706
If I was in your shoes, there is
no way I could go back up there.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.275
- [Dakota] Don't let it get the best of you.
- Yeah.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.711
- Time to conquer it.
- [Dakota] Time to conquer it.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.679
[Dakota] Well, Alex is up.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.448
I don't want to go up.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.318
- No!
- [Dakota] What did you get?

31:28.353 --> 31:30.921
- The body chute.
- [all] No!

31:30.955 --> 31:32.823
Everyone who died,
went through that chute.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.992
And, I'm gonna be sleeping
right in the middle of it.

31:35.026 --> 31:37.594
And, Chelsea, gets
the fourth floor.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.763
Which I was terrified of.

31:39.797 --> 31:43.700
What is actually happening
tonight? The worst possible scenarios.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.235
- Except for you.
- [Dakota] Yeah.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.105
Honestly, I hope karma comes
back and gets me on this trip.

31:48.139 --> 31:51.308
Because, I deserve it. This is
way too easy of a start for me.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.110
- [Tanner breathes heavily]
- Frick!

31:53.144 --> 31:54.978
[Tanner] I can't believe
I have to go up there again.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.314
[Chelsea] I feel like you're gonna
have a bloody good time up there.

32:05.823 --> 32:06.657
[breathes heavily]

32:29.013 --> 32:31.014
I've been up here for an hour.

32:32.583 --> 32:36.553
And, I've lost all my energy.

32:36.587 --> 32:39.389
I'm just feeling off.
I don't know what it is.

32:39.424 --> 32:43.060
My head feels weird.
My body is feeling weird.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.229
And I don't feel like
I'm the only one up here.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.235
Argh.

33:05.249 --> 33:06.149
Wait.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.820
Wait.

33:11.823 --> 33:12.656
Hello.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.394
Okay, wait a minute.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.497
Something just moved behind me.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.933
Did I just see that?

33:24.369 --> 33:25.702
Is there someone here with me?

33:27.138 --> 33:30.040
I must have caught that
because...

33:30.108 --> 33:33.110
I'm so confused. I just need to
explain what's going on right now.

33:34.078 --> 33:38.181
So, every night,
I set up my camera

33:38.216 --> 33:41.184
with the LCD screen facing me.

33:41.219 --> 33:44.121
And when I was looking
at my screen,

33:45.089 --> 33:46.623
I saw something move.

33:47.558 --> 33:50.327
Right back here.
Right behind my cot.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.530
So, what I'm gonna do right now

33:53.564 --> 33:57.701
is check my camera and see

33:57.735 --> 34:01.505
if what I saw with my eyes
was captured on video.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.028
Okay, I can barely see it.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.364
I definitely need to see this
on a bigger screen.

34:31.869 --> 34:32.702
[Tanner]<i> Dakota?</i>

34:33.971 --> 34:35.172
<i>Hey, Dakota.</i>

34:35.206 --> 34:37.841
I need your computer. I
think I just caught something.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.410
[Dakota]<i> You just caught</i>
<i>something on your camera?</i>

34:40.445 --> 34:42.512
- [Dakota] What?
- [Tanner]<i> I got something on my camera.</i>

34:42.547 --> 34:43.847
[Tanner] I need your computer.

34:45.349 --> 34:47.117
[indistinct conversation]

34:47.151 --> 34:48.885
[bleep]

34:49.720 --> 34:51.254
What is happening?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.722
[Dakota]<i> You want</i>
<i>to meet in the gear room?</i>

34:52.757 --> 34:55.025
[Tanner] Yeah, I'm on my way down
right now. I have both my cameras.

34:56.961 --> 34:58.862
- [Dakota] Chelsea?
- Whoa! What?

34:58.896 --> 35:00.764
- [Dakota] Sorry, sorry.
- Jeez!

35:00.798 --> 35:04.367
[Dakota] Tanner wants to review
something on my laptop right now.

35:04.402 --> 35:05.836
I guess he caught something.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.404
[Chelsea] What did he catch?
You have no idea?

35:07.438 --> 35:10.340
[Dakota] I have no idea. He
just said, he caught something.

35:10.374 --> 35:12.509
- [Dakota] Yo!
- [Tanner] Yo, dude.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.544
- [Dakota] You good?
- Dude, you're not gonna believe it.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.313
[Dakota] What did you capture?

35:16.347 --> 35:18.315
I just caught something moving
on my camera.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.549
[Dakota] Are you serious?

35:19.584 --> 35:22.219
I saw it through the
LCD screen. I had to stop.

35:22.253 --> 35:23.687
[Dakota] You literally
caught it live?

35:23.721 --> 35:26.189
I literally caught it live.
I saw it.

35:26.224 --> 35:29.259
- [Dakota]<i> Alex, are you there?</i>
- [bleep]

35:30.261 --> 35:31.661
Yeah, what's up?

35:31.696 --> 35:33.563
Come to the gear room.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.500
[Alex]<i> Okay, am on my way.</i>
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

35:36.534 --> 35:38.034
Yeah, everything is okay
as of now.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.703
Just come to the gear room
and we'll explain it.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.304
I was just staring at my camera

35:41.339 --> 35:42.472
and all of a sudden,
I saw it moving.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.174
I was zoning out and all
of a sudden, it was like...

35:45.276 --> 35:46.810
- something moved.
- What the hell?

35:46.844 --> 35:48.745
-[Dakota] Yeah, -I just need
to see it on the bigger screen.

35:50.915 --> 35:54.651
[Dakota] All right. So, just put
his memory card into my computer.

35:54.685 --> 35:57.254
I'm gonna go through
the raw footage now.

35:57.288 --> 36:00.090
So, what you gonna see is, you're
gonna see me zone out for a little bit.

36:00.124 --> 36:03.426
And then right in here. Right in
here is where I see movement.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.794
I saw it on my LCD screen.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.429
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.306
[Tanner] Right there.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.074
I'm telling you, dude.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.076
I'm telling you.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.912
It literally comes into frame

36:21.946 --> 36:24.881
and almost like it saw you
and comes back.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.484
It's almost like it saw me
looking at it

36:27.518 --> 36:30.153
and it was like, "Oh, [bleep].
It's the wrong time to move."

36:30.188 --> 36:32.255
- [Dakota] I can't believe you saw that.
- [Tanner] I know.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.891
[Dakota] You saw that on
a little tiny two inch screen.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.327
[Tanner] It's just the motion.
It was the motion.

36:37.361 --> 36:40.330
<i>I didn't really...
All I saw was movement.</i>

36:40.364 --> 36:42.199
[Dakota]<i> And you reviewed it</i>
<i>on the spot?</i>

36:42.233 --> 36:46.036
And I saw motion again. And I
was like, I need to look closer at it.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.337
I need to watch this again.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.575
[Dakota]<i> Oh, look there,</i>
<i>look there.</i>

36:51.609 --> 36:53.009
- [Chelsea]<i> Oh, my God!</i>
- [Alex]<i> Dude!</i>

36:53.678 --> 36:55.478
- [Tanner laughing]
- [bleep]

36:55.513 --> 36:57.647
Dude, you have [bleep]
captured something.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.149
[Dakota]<i> You can see it</i>
<i>on your face.</i>

36:59.183 --> 37:01.718
<i>It's like, right there. You tried
to like test it with your hands.</i>

37:01.752 --> 37:03.019
[Chelsea]<i> And the light bulb</i>
<i>goes off.</i>

37:03.087 --> 37:04.854
[Dakota]<i> And like,</i>
<i>nothing actually moves.</i>

37:04.889 --> 37:07.958
<i>And then your eyes are wide</i>
<i>and you're like, oh,</i> [bleep].

37:07.992 --> 37:10.994
[laughing] You can actually see my
brain just turning like what the [bleep].

37:11.028 --> 37:13.496
Whatever it was,
it came to a complete stop

37:13.531 --> 37:15.432
and turned right back
to where it came from.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.504
[Dakota]<i> Yeah, that's not</i>
<i>a freaking bird.</i>

37:21.539 --> 37:23.173
That is not a freaking bird.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.709
[Dakota] Dude, you're insane.
How did you catch that?

37:25.743 --> 37:28.778
[Tanner] I don't know, man.
Oh, my goodness!

37:28.813 --> 37:31.114
We've had so much stuff
happen up there, man.

37:31.148 --> 37:34.017
We heard all those noises.
I got a bloody nose.

37:34.051 --> 37:37.120
And now, we have this.
Like, we...

37:37.154 --> 37:39.289
- We need to go back up there.
- Yeah. We have to.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.625
We only have less than an hour
till the sun comes up.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.560
Till we are technically
supposed to be done.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.596
[Dakota] Let's just make the most
out of this hour and go check this out.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.067
[Tanner]<i> So, we're going</i>
<i>back up to the fifth floor.</i>

37:57.775 --> 38:00.477
- [Dakota] Okay, where was it?
- [Tanner] It was right in here.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.379
Is there anything back here?

38:02.413 --> 38:05.215
I mean, it's bathroom
into the outside.

38:05.249 --> 38:06.449
Wasn't that.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.685
[Dakota] I mean,
here is an interesting thing.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.655
<i>There is snow on the roof
and there's no footprints.</i>

38:11.689 --> 38:13.823
It wasn't like a person
messing with you.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.225
We're on the roof.

38:15.259 --> 38:18.295
Let's ask some questions. Let's
try to get some sort of an answer.

38:18.329 --> 38:21.965
All right. So, what I have in my
hand here is the digital recorder.

38:21.999 --> 38:26.136
This is a device that is said to pick up
frequencies that our ears cannot hear.

38:26.170 --> 38:29.339
And people believe that
it picks up spirit voices.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.608
I'm gonna roll
on the digital recorder.

38:31.642 --> 38:35.145
We're sitting outside
of room 502.

38:35.179 --> 38:38.081
Is there somebody up here with
us? Can you tell us who you are?

38:43.087 --> 38:46.056
Were you trying to get my attention?
Do you have a message for me?

38:51.829 --> 38:54.264
If this is the nurse,
that's been doing all of this,

38:55.099 --> 38:56.466
can you say, yes?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.669
Or give us some sort of a word
that indicates it's you?

39:00.971 --> 39:02.272
[rustling]

39:06.877 --> 39:10.280
[Dakota]<i> We asked questions</i>
<i>for about 15 minutes.</i>

39:10.314 --> 39:12.682
<i>Just played it back
for about 15 minutes.</i>

39:12.717 --> 39:13.783
No responses.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.119
But, at the end of the day,
I'm not mad at all

39:16.153 --> 39:18.455
because we got a lot
on this floor.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.957
This was one of the most
active floors we've ever been on.

39:20.991 --> 39:24.060
[Dakota] I say we pack up,
get our stuff ready,

39:24.095 --> 39:27.297
and get out of here and
move on to the next location.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.999
This is gonna be
a long freaking road trip,

39:30.034 --> 39:31.267
if this is how it started.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.880
[Chelsea] Starting off with
Waverly Hills Sanatorium

39:43.914 --> 39:48.785
was absolutely crazy. I don't
know what my brother was thinking.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.420
[Alex]<i> I just couldn't shake</i>
<i>the feeling</i>

39:50.454 --> 39:55.058
that there was someone or
something watching us the whole night.

39:55.092 --> 39:58.261
I don't think it's a patient.
I don't think it's a doctor.

39:58.295 --> 40:02.565
I don't think it's anything to do
with the tuberculosis sanatorium.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.435
<i>I really do think
that there is something dark</i>

40:05.469 --> 40:09.739
that has been haunting these
grounds for a lot longer than you think.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.045
[Tanner]<i> There is something</i>
<i>evil up on that fifth floor.</i>

40:16.080 --> 40:17.180
[sighs]

40:17.214 --> 40:21.384
I just know that it scares
the living hell out of me.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.020
If I went through what
Tanner went through last night.

40:24.054 --> 40:27.524
I don't know if I'd have
the courage to continue on.

40:27.558 --> 40:29.392
[Dakota]<i> I never thought in</i>
<i>a million years</i>

40:29.427 --> 40:33.763
that I would see Tanner
with a face full of blood.

40:33.798 --> 40:37.700
[Alex]<i> He had something happen to
him that has never happened before</i>

40:37.735 --> 40:40.170
and instead of running,
he faced that.

40:40.204 --> 40:45.141
If he didn't do that, we wouldn't have
captured what he caught on camera.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.045
[Tanner]<i> When you get</i>
<i>completely beat down</i>

40:49.079 --> 40:51.714
and you catch something
like that.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.951
It brings your
confidence level right back.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.921
<i>And I think that's one of
those things that I needed</i>

40:57.955 --> 40:59.789
especially at a place like this.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.927
[Dakota]<i> I learnt that fear</i>
<i>can be paralyzing.</i>

41:03.961 --> 41:07.664
And make you wanna stop
everything you're doing and just quit.

41:07.698 --> 41:10.133
And that's almost what
happened with Tanner last night.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.101
[Dakota]<i> But because</i>
<i>he pushed through</i>

41:12.136 --> 41:13.970
<i>and because he tackled the fear,</i>

41:15.039 --> 41:16.639
<i>it paid off.</i>

41:16.674 --> 41:18.775
[Chelsea]<i> I'm really glad</i>
<i>that we did it.</i>

41:18.809 --> 41:22.278
<i>And I feel like we have a lot
of confidence</i> moving forward.

41:22.313 --> 41:26.716
Where do we go from here? How
do we top Waverly Hills Sanatorium?

41:27.518 --> 41:30.487
I do not have
the answer to that.

41:30.521 --> 41:34.591
[Alex]<i> This wasn't just a random
start off location for Dakota.</i>

41:34.625 --> 41:36.459
<i>He has a method to his madness.</i>

41:36.494 --> 41:38.361
And if I know him
like I think I do,

41:38.395 --> 41:42.031
he has something planned
that is far worse than this.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.236
[Dakota]<i> We needed Waverly.</i>
<i>We needed these experiences</i>

41:46.270 --> 41:49.305
to get us ready and prepared
for what is to come.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.975
I am picking the next location

41:52.009 --> 41:55.778
and let's just say, I will be
messing with sensory deprivation.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.680
I don't think anyone is ready
for that.
