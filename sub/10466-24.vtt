BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING, CAN I?

10:46.254 --> 10:47.821
ABOUT...

10:47.821 --> 10:48.822
THIS--

10:48.822 --> 10:50.214
ABOUT US
GETTING MARRIED...

10:50.214 --> 10:53.391
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THAT MORE.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.871
WHAT?

10:54.871 --> 10:57.395
MOMMY, CAN YOU
HELP ME PICK WHICH
ANIMALS TO PACK?

10:57.395 --> 10:59.310
I WANT TO KEEP
SOME WITH ME,

10:59.310 --> 11:01.617
'CAUSE THE MOVERS
LOSE STUFF.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.055
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
HON, OK?

11:06.578 --> 11:08.189
MOVERS...

11:17.677 --> 11:18.721
ANNIE...

11:18.721 --> 11:20.854
I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.812
YOU'RE MOVING?

11:25.249 --> 11:26.686
TO BE WITH JAY?

11:36.347 --> 11:39.742
YOU WERE NEVER
GOING TO SAY
YES, WERE YOU?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.135
BAILEY,

11:41.135 --> 11:43.441
THIS...

11:43.441 --> 11:47.445
THIS HAS BEEN
THE LONGEST 4 DAYS
OF MY LIFE.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.405
I DON'T THINK
I'VE SLEPT
SINCE HE GOT HERE,

11:50.405 --> 11:55.236
AND ALL I DO IS RUN IT
OVER AND OVER.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.978
NATALIE AND JAY AND YOU

11:57.978 --> 12:00.328
AND THE DRINKING
AND OAKLAND AND YOU...

12:00.328 --> 12:03.331
AND THERE'S
ALL THESE REASONS

12:03.331 --> 12:05.115
ON ONE SIDE...

12:06.813 --> 12:10.077
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE...

12:10.077 --> 12:11.731
THERE'S JUST YOU.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.354
HEY.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.356
HEY.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.314
SO...

12:30.314 --> 12:32.926
HERE'S THE PROBLEM
I'M HAVING:

12:32.926 --> 12:34.971
I CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.017
I MEAN...

12:37.017 --> 12:38.627
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

12:38.627 --> 12:42.152
WHAT AM I GOING TO
DO IN 5 MONTHS WHEN
I'M OUT TO HERE, OK?

12:42.152 --> 12:44.633
NOBODY HIRES
A PREGNANT STRIPPER.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:44.633 --> 12:48.419
AND THERE ARE NO...
FAT DISNEY HEROINES,

12:48.419 --> 12:50.508
SO...YOU KNOW,
LET'S FACE IT:

12:50.508 --> 12:52.336
IN ONE TRIMESTER,

12:52.336 --> 12:54.512
I'M GOING
TO BE PREGNANT
AND OUT OF WORK.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.601
DAPHNE--
AND EVEN IF I CAN
FIGURE OUT A WAY

12:56.601 --> 12:58.386
TO MAKE IT
THROUGH 9 MONTHS,

12:58.386 --> 13:01.041
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO AFTER
THE BABY'S BORN?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.217
I CAN'T AFFORD
A NANNY...

13:03.217 --> 13:05.393
YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS
LIVE IN DALLAS...

13:05.393 --> 13:07.177
NOT THAT THEY
WOULD STEP FOOT
IN THE HOUSE

13:07.177 --> 13:09.484
OF THEIR UNWED-
STRIPPER-DAUGHTER-
MOM ANYWAY.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.529
WHAT ABOUT ME?

13:11.529 --> 13:14.619
NO. DON'T SAY THAT, OK?
DON'T SAY THAT.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.970
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE

13:16.970 --> 13:19.363
OR WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DOING IN 9 MONTHS

13:19.363 --> 13:22.366
OR A YEAR OR 3 YEARS.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.413
AND I'M A FLAKE.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.763
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW
I LIVE MY LIFE.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.026
SOMETIMES I WORK...

13:30.026 --> 13:32.986
SOMETIMES I SKIP DINNER
2 NIGHTS IN A ROW,

13:32.986 --> 13:35.466
AND WHO CARES? I'M ONLY
TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.123
I AM NOT A MOM,
CHARLIE.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.952
THIS IS
NOT A PICTURE
OF A GOOD MOM.
DAPHNE--

13:42.952 --> 13:45.476
AND I HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT NOT HAVING
THIS BABY,

13:45.476 --> 13:48.436
AND...I THINK THAT...

13:48.436 --> 13:51.526
I'M GOING TO BE OK
WITH IT. I'M NOT HAPPY...

13:51.526 --> 13:53.049
BUT OK...

13:53.049 --> 13:54.703
AND I'D REALLY LIKE...

14:01.797 --> 14:04.191
I WOULD REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

14:04.191 --> 14:06.846
IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT
WITH THAT,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.370
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BANK.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.116
Julia: WOW, LOOK
AT THIS, GRIFFIN.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.682
MARRIED STUDENT HOUSING.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.032
IT'S RIGHT ON CAMPUS,

14:19.032 --> 14:21.121
BUT IT'S SET UP LIKE
THESE LITTLE APARTMENTS.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.905
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.385
I WAS THINKING
I'LL SET UP MY SCHEDULE

14:24.385 --> 14:26.169
SO I TAKE ALL MY CLASSES
IN THE MORNING,

14:26.169 --> 14:27.997
IN THE AFTERNOONS,
I DO MY HOMEWORK,

14:27.997 --> 14:30.130
SO THAT WHEN YOU COME HOME,
WE CAN REALLY BE TOGETHER.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.698
UH, DON'T
DO THAT, JULIA.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.179
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT WHICH
CLASSES TO TAKE

14:36.179 --> 14:37.398
TO FIT MY SCHEDULE.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.487
IT'S OK. I DON'T MIND.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.531
REALLY.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.185
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

14:42.185 --> 14:44.840
YOU SHOULD BE
LIVING IN A DORM,

14:44.840 --> 14:47.190
HAVING A NORMAL
COLLEGE LIFE.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.627
THAT WAY YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MAKE EXCUSES

14:49.627 --> 14:51.847
FOR WHY YOU DIDN'T
GET TO DO THE THINGS
YOU WANTED TO DO,

14:51.847 --> 14:53.109
YOU KNOW.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.111
THIS--IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A GREAT YEAR
FOR YOU,

14:55.111 --> 14:57.113
NOT A YEAR WHERE
YOU HAVE TO MAKE

14:57.113 --> 14:59.507
A MILLION
COMPROMISES.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.950
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.387
I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD
SEPARATE, JULIA.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.042
I, UH...

15:13.042 --> 15:14.957
I WISH I COULD THINK
OF ANOTHER WAY

15:14.957 --> 15:18.221
TO MAKE THIS
ALL WORK...

15:18.221 --> 15:19.614
BUT I CAN'T.

15:21.746 --> 15:25.185
GRIFFIN, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:25.185 --> 15:28.014
IT DOES WORK.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.277
WE--WE WORK.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.844
I MEAN, THIS--
THIS WEEKEND...

15:32.844 --> 15:34.194
THIS WEEKEND WAS GREAT.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.587
IT WAS LIKE WE REMEMBERED
HOW TO BE HAPPY AGAIN.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.415
DOESN'T THAT
MEAN SOMETHING?

15:38.415 --> 15:42.593
STAYING IN SOME
FANCY HOTEL...

15:42.593 --> 15:44.378
STROLLING ALONG
THE BEACH...

15:44.378 --> 15:46.989
PRETENDING
TO BE PEOPLE
THAT WE'RE NOT...

15:46.989 --> 15:49.470
THAT'S NOT
REAL LIFE.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.735
IT FELT REAL TO ME.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.519
NOT THAT.

15:55.519 --> 15:59.480
THIS IS REAL LIFE.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.048
HAVING TO MAKE...
HARD DECISIONS
AND...

16:04.006 --> 16:07.183
COMPROMISING WHAT
EACH OTHER WANTS.

16:07.183 --> 16:11.231
TRYING NOT TO
HURT EACH OTHER.

16:11.231 --> 16:16.062
THAT'S WHAT OUR
WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER
HAS BEEN ABOUT.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.368
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE DON'T
LOVE EACH OTHER.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.198
IT JUST MEANS

16:22.198 --> 16:25.114
THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULDN'T LIVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.289
[SIGHS]

16:30.337 --> 16:33.253
GOD, IT'S JUST
THIS WEEKEND, I...

16:33.253 --> 16:36.212
I JUST SAW YOU
WERE JUST SO HAPPY,

16:36.212 --> 16:39.476
SO I STARTED
THINKING, I SAID...

16:39.476 --> 16:41.304
WHAT IS IT
THAT I CAN GIVE YOU

16:41.304 --> 16:44.046
THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU THAT HAPPY
IN REAL LIFE?

16:46.527 --> 16:49.269
THE ONLY THING
THAT I COULD
THINK OF WAS...

16:51.619 --> 16:56.189
WAS TO LET YOU
GO OFF AND BE
ON YOUR OWN.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.712
I CAN GIVE YOU THAT.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.999
COME ON, JULIA,
I GOT TO GET
SOME SLEEP.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.348
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE BEAT

17:25.348 --> 17:27.263
FOR THAT THING
TOMORROW.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.092
I'M MEMORIZING YOUR EAR.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.050
OH. WHAT?

17:33.617 --> 17:36.272
THE WAY IT KIND OF
CURVES AROUND HERE...

17:36.272 --> 17:39.232
AND HOW IT'S SOFT
RIGHT HERE...

17:39.232 --> 17:41.930
AND YOU'VE GOT A...

17:41.930 --> 17:44.889
SCAR...RIGHT HERE.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.764
I GUESS I'M JUST, UH...

17:52.201 --> 17:55.335
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS, UH...

17:55.335 --> 17:56.466
HARD.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.645
I'M JUST KIND OF USED
TO YOU ALWAYS BEING HERE.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.522
SO, I'M MEMORIZING
YOUR FACE.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.874
WOULD IT MAKE IT
ANY EASIER

18:12.874 --> 18:16.312
IF I DROVE YOU
TO THIS THING IN
STANFORD TOMORROW?

18:16.312 --> 18:18.575
YEAH.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.968
A LITTLE.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.414
NO WAY.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.415
YEAH.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.634
NO WAY!
YEAH. YUP.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.288
MAN, NO--

18:35.288 --> 18:36.985
LOOK, JUST KNOCK IT
OFF, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S NOT HELPING.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.334
Claudia: I'M COMING, CHAR,

18:38.334 --> 18:40.075
I'M JUST HAVING
TROUBLE WITH MY ZIPPER.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.686
COULD YOU MAKE SURE
THERE'S FILM IN THE CAMERA?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.079
THERE'S FILM, CLAUD.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.385
COULD YOU
DOUBLE-CHECK?

18:45.385 --> 18:48.431
I WANT ALL THOSE
HOURS BACK YOU MADE
ME SIT AND LISTEN

18:48.431 --> 18:49.824
TO THOSE STUPID
CONDOM LECTURES.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.434
MAN, WHAT
WERE YOU THINKING?

18:51.434 --> 18:53.306
I WASN'T.

18:53.306 --> 18:56.091
OBVIOUSLY.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.962
OK. SO WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?

18:57.962 --> 18:59.312
SHE DOESN'T WANT IT.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.965
SHE'S MADE THAT
PRETTY CLEAR.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.663
SHE'S NOT READY
FOR THAT CHANGE
IN HER LIFE.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.795
WELL...THEN...

19:04.795 --> 19:07.407
YEAH. THAT WOULD TAKE
CARE OF IT, YOU KNOW.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.496
PROBLEM SOLVED.
JUST GO ON LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED,

19:09.496 --> 19:12.194
LIKE IT WAS A,
LIKE IT WAS A MISTAKE,
LIKE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.892
WELL, I MEAN,
WASN'T IT?

19:17.243 --> 19:18.896
I JUST KEEP THINKING,
YOU KNOW...

19:18.896 --> 19:21.029
MAYBE STUFF HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.944
YOU GO THROUGH A YEAR
LIKE I'VE HAD WHERE
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

19:22.944 --> 19:25.512
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE
AND THEN YOU DO...

19:25.512 --> 19:26.948
AND YOU MAKE A BABY...

19:26.948 --> 19:28.689
A BABY!

19:28.689 --> 19:31.039
I MEAN, MAYBE
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.911
ALMOST DYING,
AND THEN...

19:33.911 --> 19:35.870
BECOMING A FATHER.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.742
SO WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING THEN?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.135
IT JUST...

19:42.529 --> 19:44.574
BAY, IT FEELS
LIKE A SIGN.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.011
A SIGN?

19:48.317 --> 19:49.971
A BAD SIGN?

20:02.026 --> 20:03.985
MUST BE THE GROUP
UP THERE, HUH?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.029
YEAH.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.988
SO I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT 6:00?

20:06.988 --> 20:08.076
OK.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.648
HEY, GO.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.452
HI.

20:36.452 --> 20:37.453

20:40.500 --> 20:42.241
SO, WHAT HIGH SCHOOL
ARE YOU FROM?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.025
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
COMING STRAIGHT
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.592
I TOOK A YEAR OFF.

20:45.592 --> 20:48.159
REALLY? WOW, THAT
MUST'VE BEEN GREAT.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.512
YEAH.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.078
YEAH, IT WAS.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.236
YOU ALL DONE?

21:21.236 --> 21:24.021
WELL, I'M SURE I
HAVE ENTIRE DRAWERS
FULL OF STUFF

21:24.021 --> 21:25.371
LEFT UPSTAIRS, BUT--

21:25.371 --> 21:29.288
I'M GOING TO BOX UP
YOUR MAIL FOR YOU,
AND, UH...

21:29.288 --> 21:31.855
AND SEND IT OFF
UNTIL THE POST OFFICE
FORWARDS IT.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.293
OK, THANKS.
BUT ARE YOU--

21:34.293 --> 21:36.295
AND YOU'VE GOT ABOUT...

COMING TO YOU, SO...

SEND IT, LET ME KNOW.

DON'T YOU WANT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

21:46.217 --> 21:47.567
IT'S NOT...

21:51.222 --> 21:54.138
YOU NEVER GAVE ME
A CHANCE, ANNIE.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.184
BAILEY, IT'S
NOT ABOUT YOU.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.317
IT'S ABOUT NAT
AND BEING MARRIED--

21:58.317 --> 22:01.407
NO. A CHANCE...

22:01.407 --> 22:04.540
TO GET USED TO IT.
I CAN'T...

22:04.540 --> 22:06.150
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
ANY TIME.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.284
HE SHOWED UP HERE, AND...

22:09.284 --> 22:10.851
AND YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT

22:10.851 --> 22:13.288
AND YOU PACKED UP
YOUR STUFF AND
THAT'S--THAT'S IT.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.377

22:20.164 --> 22:21.818
BAILEY, I'M SORRY,

22:21.818 --> 22:23.559
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.475
NO, I--I GET IT, OK?

22:26.475 --> 22:28.956
I'M NOT SAYING
PLEASE STAY.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.914
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.089
I'M JUST SAYING...

22:34.353 --> 22:36.920
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO,
AND YOU'RE GOING, ANNIE.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.229

23:23.053 --> 23:26.883
DID YOU KIDS SAY
THE ST. ALBANS
PREP SCHOOL?

23:26.883 --> 23:28.363
YEAH. WHY?

23:28.363 --> 23:29.495
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.975
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.070
I KNEW IT.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.814
I JUST
KNEW, KNEW, KNEW
THIS WOULD HAPPEN!

23:44.814 --> 23:46.599
WHAT? KNEW WHAT? WHAT?

23:46.599 --> 23:48.644
THIS...
THIS WOULD HAPPEN!

23:48.644 --> 23:50.472

23:54.345 --> 23:55.782
NO. NO. NO WAY.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.261
HERE, HERE, LET ME
CHECK THE INVITE.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.046
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

"ST. ALBANS,

OOPS.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.404
THIS IS
NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT.

24:09.404 --> 24:10.840
I KNOW.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.233
CLAUDIA...

24:12.233 --> 24:14.191
I AM SO SORRY.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.326
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
YOU'RE
DAMN STRAIGHT IT IS!

24:27.204 --> 24:28.423
SO...

24:28.423 --> 24:31.426
MAYBE I'LL, UH...

24:31.426 --> 24:33.907
YOU KNOW,
EVERY SO OFTEN, I'LL...

24:33.907 --> 24:37.519
CALL YOU OR SOMETHING
AND TELL YOU STUFF.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.478
I MEAN, WE CAN STILL
DO THAT, RIGHT?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.829
WHY, YEAH. SURE.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.395
LIKE IF I...

24:44.395 --> 24:47.398
FAIL MY ART HISTORY
MIDTERM, OR...

24:47.398 --> 24:49.749
OR IF I WRITE
AN EPIC POEM,

24:49.749 --> 24:52.708
AND I NEED A WORD
THAT RHYMES WITH "ORANGE."

24:52.708 --> 24:55.624
NO, WE CAN
CALL EACH OTHER.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.282
TELL YOU THE TRUTH:
I CAN'T REALLY THINK
OF A WORD

25:01.282 --> 25:02.413
THAT RHYMES
WITH "ORANGE."

25:02.413 --> 25:03.414
[LAUGHS]

25:03.414 --> 25:05.242
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.810
SO IT WILL KIND
OF BE A LONG CALL.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.683
WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE
ON THE PHONE ALL NIGHT
OR SOMETHING.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.345
TELL HIM I CAN'T
FORGIVE HIM YET...

AND I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.829

FORGIVE YOU SOON.

25:26.829 --> 25:31.138
TELL HER I DON'T
KNOW HOW I COULD'VE
BEEN SO STUPID.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.140
HE'S WONDERING
HOW HE GOT SO STUPID.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.011
I MEAN, I BLEW IT.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.187
I AM POND SCUM.
I AM WORSE
THAN POND SCUM.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.015
I'M LIKE THE LITTLE
STUFF THAT FLOATS
AROUND POND SCUM--

25:39.015 --> 25:40.539

25:40.539 --> 25:42.279
THIS--THIS PITY PARTY

25:42.279 --> 25:44.760
IS GETTING
ON MY NERVES ALREADY!

25:44.760 --> 25:47.110

TO DANCE, MAN!

DANCE WITH ME?

25:57.164 --> 25:58.426

25:58.426 --> 26:00.384
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT
WE CAME HERE TO DO.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.125
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT!

26:03.910 --> 26:05.259
BUT THERE'S NO MUSIC.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.000
OK.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.784
MUSIC.

[MUSIC BEGINS]

26:28.543 --> 26:30.197
MAY I HAVE
THIS DANCE,

26:30.197 --> 26:31.198

27:09.410 --> 27:10.716
HI.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.764
EVERY TIME ANYBODY
GOES TO GET A MUG

27:15.764 --> 27:17.940
THEY SLAM THEIR HEAD
ON THIS THING.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.377
I'M SICK OF PEOPLE
HURTING THEMSELVES.

27:20.377 --> 27:23.206
IS THIS
THE WRONG TIME?

27:23.206 --> 27:25.252
AM I
THE WRONG PERSON?

27:25.252 --> 27:27.210
IT'S JUST...

27:27.210 --> 27:28.211
WHEN YOU DIDN'T
COME HOME...

27:28.211 --> 27:29.430
IT'S NOT--

27:29.430 --> 27:33.347
WHATEVER. I'M JUST...

27:33.347 --> 27:35.784
OBVIOUSLY
DOING WHATEVER I CAN

27:35.784 --> 27:37.743
TO STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM THAT PLACE.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.266
YEAH.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.921
'CAUSE WHEN I LET MYSELF
THINK ABOUT IT,

27:41.921 --> 27:44.445
IT JUST MAKES ME MAD.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.186
LIKE, BITTER.

27:46.186 --> 27:49.842
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU,
IT IS STARTING TO SEEM LIKE

27:49.842 --> 27:52.888
ALL THIS TIME HAS GONE BY

27:52.888 --> 27:56.283
AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE.

27:56.283 --> 27:59.112
I'M RIGHT BACK
WHERE I STARTED.

27:59.112 --> 28:02.724
THAT IS NOT TRUE
AT ALL, BAILEY.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.509
I MEAN, A YEAR AGO,
YOU WERE
ON PROBATION.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.337
YOU COULDN'T GET
A JOB. YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE IN THE HELL

28:07.337 --> 28:09.905
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
FIT IN.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.298
BUT NOW--

28:11.298 --> 28:13.343
GOD. LOOK AT YOU.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.912
YOU HAVE FOUND
THIS THING THAT
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.480
I MEAN, THIS JOB
LET'S YOU DO EVERYTHING

28:19.480 --> 28:21.438
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.180
YOU KNOW?
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.749
YOU GOT A LOT
FROM THIS YEAR, BAILEY.

28:27.749 --> 28:31.492
AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT YOU...

28:34.408 --> 28:37.237
YOU GOT A LOT.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.545
OK, LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.112
NOW, YOU WANT TO
HAVE A CHILD

28:43.112 --> 28:45.549
WITH A WOMAN WHOSE MIDDLE NAME
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.638

ELAINE, RIGHT?

28:47.638 --> 28:49.771
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR SHOE SIZE.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.077
12 AND 1/2.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.253
LOOK, I THOUGHT
WE DECIDED THIS.

28:53.253 --> 28:56.996
I MEAN, I MADE
AN APPOINTMENT, OK?

28:56.996 --> 28:59.738
AND THAT WAS--WAS HARD.
BUT I DID IT.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.435
AND I'M TRYING TO BE
OK WITH IT.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.178
LOOK, AND I TOLD YOU
WHY I CAN'T--

29:05.178 --> 29:06.396
I KNOW. YOU TOLD ME

29:06.396 --> 29:08.050
ALL THE THINGS
ABOUT YOURSELF

29:08.050 --> 29:09.399
THAT SAID THAT YOU
CAN'T FIT

29:09.399 --> 29:10.705
A KID
INTO YOUR LIFE.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.881
AND--AND
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:12.881 --> 29:15.275
I SAID THOSE SAME
THINGS ABOUT MYSELF

29:15.275 --> 29:16.406
A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.060
AND I GUESS...

29:18.060 --> 29:20.976
THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHO YOU ARE
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

29:20.976 --> 29:24.371
IT'S WHO YOU'RE
WILLING TO BECOME.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.373
SEE, IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO CHANGE,

29:26.373 --> 29:27.809
TO BE CHANGED BY
THIS CHILD,

29:27.809 --> 29:29.158
THEN I KNOW THAT
WE CAN FIND A WAY

29:29.158 --> 29:31.117
TO MAKE ALL
THE OTHER STUFF WORK.

29:31.117 --> 29:34.947
WE'LL DO THIS
TOGETHER.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.210
WE'LL RAISE HIM
TOGETHER.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.647
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY
TO SAY THAT, CHARLIE.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.997
AND I KNOW THAT THAT SOUNDS--

29:41.997 --> 29:43.477
GOD, SO SELFISH,

29:43.477 --> 29:46.480
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON
MORE THAN I CAN HANDLE.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.177
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.397
TO ANYONE.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.529
OK, THEN...

29:52.529 --> 29:53.443
[SNIFFS]

29:55.402 --> 29:58.057
WHAT IF YOU WAIT?

29:58.057 --> 30:01.321
WAIT? I CAN'T WAIT.

30:01.321 --> 30:03.453
TILL AFTER HE'S BORN.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.673
WHAT IF YOU
FIGURE OUT

30:05.673 --> 30:07.414
WHAT YOU WANT
YOUR ROLE TO BE

30:07.414 --> 30:10.112
ONCE HE'S
IN THE WORLD.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.158
AND NOT SOME
HYPOTHETICAL.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.030
AND EITHER WE DO
THIS TOGETHER,

30:15.030 --> 30:16.118
WE'LL RAISE HIM
TOGETHER.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.468
OR...

30:18.468 --> 30:21.297
I'LL TAKE HIM.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.951
I'LL TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIM.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.344
I'LL RAISE HIM
MYSELF.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.220
CHARLIE.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.353
SEE, THAT WAY YOU
DON'T HAVE TO KNOW

30:33.353 --> 30:34.441
HOW IT'S ALL GONNA
WORK OUT

30:34.441 --> 30:36.269
TO--TO SAY YES.

30:38.227 --> 30:41.665
SAY YES, DAPHNE.

30:50.805 --> 30:54.200
THIS PLACE LOOKS
SO DIFFERENT
ALREADY, HUH?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.637
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE
NEVER HERE.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.247
OH, BAILEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:58.247 --> 30:59.727
UM, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE,

30:59.727 --> 31:02.251
JUST LET ME DO IT.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.209
OK.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.909
DO YOU MIND IF I
WATCH FOR A MINUTE?

31:07.909 --> 31:10.738
THE FUMES WILL HELP
CLEAR MY HEAD.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.914
YEAH, SURE.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.355
GOD...

31:21.140 --> 31:22.532
IT'S SO WEIRD.

31:25.144 --> 31:29.670
I KEEP THINKING OF THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS, YOU KNOW?

31:29.670 --> 31:32.542
AT HOW CRAZED I WAS.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.805
HOW MUCH I WANTED TO FIGHT.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.633
I WAS SO TERRIFIED
OF LOSING HER.

31:36.633 --> 31:40.028
ONLY NOW...

31:40.028 --> 31:42.639
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
I THOUGHT IT WOULD FEEL.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.164
SARAH--

31:45.164 --> 31:46.165
OH!

31:46.165 --> 31:48.080
HA HA.
HA HA.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.385
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SUCH A MORON.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.430
YES, YOU ARE.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.518
OH, THANK YOU.

31:54.042 --> 31:57.872
SARAH, WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS FOR ME?

31:57.872 --> 32:00.788
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO GOOD TO ME?

32:00.788 --> 32:03.312
REALLY.

32:03.312 --> 32:05.575
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.795
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

32:07.795 --> 32:10.363
WHY ARE YOU STILL
HERE WITH ME?

32:10.363 --> 32:13.322
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.716
I MEAN, IT'S WHAT IT WAS
ALWAYS, PRETTY MUCH.

32:17.239 --> 32:20.068
I LOVE YOU.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.896
THAT'S ALL.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.301
Charlie:
SO WE'RE JUST GOING
TO TAKE IT

32:35.301 --> 32:37.390
ONE STEP AT A TIME,
YOU KNOW?

32:37.390 --> 32:38.608
DAPHNE MAY STAY,

32:38.608 --> 32:41.829
AND SHE MAY NOT.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.309
ALL I KNOW FOR SURE

32:43.309 --> 32:45.659
IS THAT I'M IN IT
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.274
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, CHARLIE?

32:52.274 --> 32:54.973
THAT YOU'RE HAPPY
FOR ME.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.807
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.113
I MEAN, REALLY READY?

33:05.113 --> 33:08.464
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.292
I'M READY FOR THAT.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.294
AND, HELL,
I'VE GOT 8 MONTHS

33:12.294 --> 33:13.600
TO READ
ALL THE BOOKS

33:13.600 --> 33:15.471
AND TO HAVE ALL
THE ANXIETY ATTACKS

33:15.471 --> 33:16.385
AND TO GET
THE LATEST RESEARCH

33:16.385 --> 33:18.474
ON THE STROLLERS
AND THE CAR SEATS.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.781
AND WHERE THE AMA STANDS
ON INFANT SLEEPING POSITIONS

33:20.781 --> 33:22.478
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
DOING NEW STUDIES.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.350
RIGHT, THAT.

33:24.350 --> 33:25.786
SEE, I WOULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.005
YOU KNOW THIS STUFF.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.356
RIGHT.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.924
KIRSTEN,
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.279
I'M TRYING.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.671
IT'S HARD.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.021
I KNOW IT IS.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.938
AND I KNOW
WHAT HAVING A CHILD
MEANS TO YOU.

33:47.938 --> 33:51.116
AND HOW UNFAIR IT IS
THAT YOU CAN'T.

33:51.116 --> 33:54.206
BUT, I MEAN,

33:54.206 --> 33:56.077
KIRSTEN, THIS KID
IS--IS ON HIS WAY.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.688
I MEAN,
THIS IS REALLY
GOING TO HAPPEN.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.168
AND YOU'RE
MY BEST FRIEND.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.343
I DON'T WANT TO
GO THROUGH THIS

34:01.343 --> 34:03.519
WITHOUT BEING ABLE
TO CALL YOU
ON THE PHONE

34:03.519 --> 34:05.739
AND HYPERVENTILATE.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.480
OR GIVE HIM
TO YOU TO HOLD.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.524
CHARLIE...

34:08.524 --> 34:09.960
AND I KNOW
THIS IS
TOTALLY SELFISH.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.614
I KNOW THAT.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.181
BUT I--

34:13.181 --> 34:15.575
I WANT YOU
TO LOVE HIM.

34:15.575 --> 34:18.578
I WANT HIM TO
BE LOVED BY YOU.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.667
BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW INCREDIBLE
THAT FEELS

34:20.667 --> 34:22.799
TO HAVE YOU
IN MY LIFE.

34:22.799 --> 34:26.977
I WANT HIM TO
HAVE THAT, TOO.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.901
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE,

34:37.901 --> 34:39.990
HE COULD BE A--A GIRL.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.472
YOU COULD HAVE
A LITTLE GIRL.

34:51.785 --> 34:55.702
I'LL BUY HER FIRST PAIR
OF MARY JANES.

AND OPENED IT FOR YOU.
