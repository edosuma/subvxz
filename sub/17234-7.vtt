00:01.567 --> 00:03.261
<i>Previously on "Nashville"... </i>

00:03.288 --> 00:06.026
- You're marrying her?
- I hate this.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.523
(Will) You want me to date Layla?

00:07.591 --> 00:08.591
Why pass up the chance to deflect

00:08.659 --> 00:10.393
some of her shine onto you?

00:10.460 --> 00:13.663
- Is that easier to play than the guitar?
- The way I play it, it is.

00:13.730 --> 00:15.831
I'm glad you're here.

00:15.899 --> 00:19.668
I was thinking of Scarlett
being one of your opening acts.

00:21.737 --> 00:23.939
- Charlie Wentworth?
- What are you implying?

00:24.007 --> 00:27.176
He's a powerful, prominent, married man.

00:27.243 --> 00:30.846
We're good friends.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.716
<i>(Man on radio) Good morning,
Texas! Bobby Delmont here,</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:37.952
<i>KCUT 105.2, "Cutting edge country."</i>

00:38.020 --> 00:41.289
<i>(Screaming) Well, today
is the day, my friends.</i>

00:41.357 --> 00:44.326
<i>Juliette Barnes' "Inside the dream" tour</i>

00:44.393 --> 00:47.495
<i>opens right here in
Houston... two sold-out shows.</i>

00:47.563 --> 00:50.264
<i>Juliette! But don't feel bad
if you don't have tickets,</i>

00:50.332 --> 00:52.766
<i>because we're giving 'em away for free.</i>

00:52.767 --> 00:54.600
<i>So stay tuned for your chance to win.</i>

00:54.656 --> 00:57.125
<i>You know, I'm really excited
about this tour because</i>

00:57.192 --> 01:00.094
<i>it's one of those rare
times when the undercard</i>

01:00.162 --> 01:03.297
<i>might be even better than the main event.</i>

01:03.365 --> 01:06.400
<i>Layla Grant is hot, hot, hot,</i>

01:06.468 --> 01:08.201
<i>and I just can't get enough of this song.</i>

01:08.270 --> 01:10.137
<i>Here's Layla Grant with... </i>

01:10.204 --> 01:12.439
(Radio turns off) Looks like
Santa Claus has a thing for Layla.

01:12.507 --> 01:16.610
- Shocker.
- I can't believe Delmont hasn't been fired yet.

01:16.678 --> 01:18.111
Or arrested.

01:18.179 --> 01:21.581
I know what you said. I
just wanna see it in writing.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.650
What? You don't trust me?

01:23.717 --> 01:26.052
- I trust a contract even more.
- Okay, then.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.422
Well, why don't you just...
come on over and get 'em?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.424
Why am I starting to get
the distinct impression

01:31.492 --> 01:33.459
you're interested in
more than just paperwork?

01:33.527 --> 01:34.694
I'll tell you what.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.097
You have your agent send those papers over,

01:37.165 --> 01:39.198
then we can have a conversation
about maybe getting together.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.433
All right.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.467
Bye.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.203
Should I even ask?

01:44.271 --> 01:47.273
Oh, Luke. Listen, all I care about

01:47.341 --> 01:48.808
is getting Scarlett's papers signed

01:48.875 --> 01:50.476
and getting her on that tour bus.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.590
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:51.591 --> 01:54.353
Kinda sounded like maybe
you wanna get on that bus.

01:54.370 --> 01:56.671
- You are ridiculous.
- Really?

01:56.739 --> 01:58.607
Liam's off in parts unknown.

01:58.674 --> 02:01.676
Well, men are my last priority
right now. God bless 'em.

02:01.744 --> 02:03.011
I just need to get Scarlett on tour

02:03.079 --> 02:04.646
so she's not in Jeff's studio.

02:04.714 --> 02:05.847
The minute she records something with him,

02:05.915 --> 02:07.882
it belongs to Edgehill.

02:07.950 --> 02:08.902
- Hey, honey.
- Mom,

02:08.904 --> 02:11.050
Maddie does not wanna sing
at dad's wedding reception,

02:11.053 --> 02:12.420
so she won't practice.

02:12.488 --> 02:15.256
You know, it's okay. I'm gonna talk to her.

02:15.324 --> 02:16.825
- Mom.
- Why don't you go play outside for a little bit?

02:16.892 --> 02:17.926
It's all right.

02:17.994 --> 02:19.628
(Sighs)

02:21.230 --> 02:23.197
(Kiss) (Sighs)

02:23.265 --> 02:26.768
Poor Maddie. Still not
thrilled about the wedding.

02:26.836 --> 02:29.670
Please. Who is thrilled about this wedding?

02:29.738 --> 02:31.524
Peggy Kenter's gonna
be part of this family?

02:31.537 --> 02:34.708
- How did that happen?
- Teddy couldn't keep it in his pants,

02:34.776 --> 02:36.677
- that's how.
- (Whispering) Shh! Because the girls still don't know

02:36.745 --> 02:39.280
- that Peggy's pregnant.
- (Lowered voice) They are gonna find out soon enough.

02:39.348 --> 02:41.215
- Not gonna find out today. Tch!
- Okay.

(Utensil clinks)

02:58.466 --> 03:00.500
I didn't know you were...

03:00.568 --> 03:02.835
I... I was just here 'cause, uh...

03:02.903 --> 03:06.640
Uh... I'm... I'm really
sorry a... about the milk.

03:06.707 --> 03:08.308
I really thought you were
staying at Megan's last night.

03:08.376 --> 03:09.676
She's out of town doing depositions.

03:09.743 --> 03:12.579
You know, I'm... I'm just
gonna... I'm gonna go.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.417
(Clink)

03:18.485 --> 03:19.713
When'd you two get back together?

03:19.715 --> 03:20.268
- (Door opens)
- (Yawns) I don't know

03:20.269 --> 03:21.269
that we're back together. We're just...

03:22.422 --> 03:24.356
- (Door closes)
- Not "not together."

03:24.424 --> 03:26.926
We're out of milk.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.334
(Bowl clatters)

03:35.402 --> 03:36.569
(Laughter)

03:36.636 --> 03:38.937
(Giggles)

03:39.045 --> 03:41.146
Ahh. Will should go on tour more often.

03:41.214 --> 03:43.915
Mm. It's nice having
the place to ourselves.

03:43.983 --> 03:46.719
(Chuckles) But you know
you live alone, right?

03:46.786 --> 03:48.920
I mean, we could always go there.

03:48.988 --> 03:51.156
No, Scarlett has a key to my place,

03:51.224 --> 03:53.358
and it might not be a very good idea.

03:53.425 --> 03:54.826
Uh... yeah.

03:54.894 --> 03:57.362
My best friend, your ex...
could walk in any minute.

03:57.429 --> 03:59.931
Yes, that is probably not the best way

03:59.999 --> 04:02.100
for her to find out we're together.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.537
(Cell phone rings)

04:06.605 --> 04:07.872
(Sighs) Damn it.

04:07.939 --> 04:09.307
(Ring) (Clears throat)

04:09.375 --> 04:10.875
(Beep) Hello?

04:10.942 --> 04:12.577
Gunnar. Jeff Fordham. Edgehill Records.

04:12.645 --> 04:14.712
Yeah, we met at the stockholder showcase.

04:14.780 --> 04:17.148
Yes, sir. (Clears throat) Uh, I remember.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.416
Um... uh, what's... how's it going, dude?

04:19.485 --> 04:20.851
Well, truthfully, buddy,

04:20.918 --> 04:22.019
I'd be doing a lot better

04:22.087 --> 04:23.754
if will Lexington was recording your song.

04:23.822 --> 04:26.590
Uh, yeah. Y... you see, the thing is, um...

04:26.658 --> 04:28.125
with that, uh...

04:28.193 --> 04:30.460
Any chance I could get you
to sit down with me tomorrow?

04:30.528 --> 04:32.429
Sure. Absolutely. That'd be great.

04:32.497 --> 04:33.530
Good, good, good.

04:33.598 --> 04:35.465
I will have my office set it up.

04:35.533 --> 04:36.667
(Beep)

04:36.734 --> 04:38.735
That was Jeff Fordham at Edgehill Records.

04:38.804 --> 04:41.338
They're still after your song?

04:41.406 --> 04:42.906
Yeah. Am I being stupid about this?

04:42.973 --> 04:44.675
Gunnar, you wanna record that song.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.343
There's nothing stupid about that.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.545
Yeah, but what... what is the
use of keeping it for myself

04:48.613 --> 04:52.015
if nobody outside of
Nashville's gonna hear it?

04:52.082 --> 04:54.418
Hey, maybe I could leverage
it for a... for a record deal

04:54.485 --> 04:58.054
or getting myself on a tour, or anything.

04:58.122 --> 05:00.023
Thank you for coming over so last minute.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.725
Um... I have a little somethin'
I wanted to share with you,

05:02.793 --> 05:04.227
and I wanted to tell you in person.

05:05.595 --> 05:08.364
You are about to join Luke Wheeler's tour.

05:08.432 --> 05:10.566
(Laughs) Are you excited?

05:10.634 --> 05:13.469
- I'm shocked. I didn't think it would actually happen.
- It's happening.

05:13.537 --> 05:15.471
They just messengered
these contracts over here

05:15.539 --> 05:19.007
- just this afternoon, and you're leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

05:19.075 --> 05:20.343
I know. I know it seems fast.

05:20.410 --> 05:22.311
That's the way it goes a lot of times,

05:22.379 --> 05:23.479
but you're gonna be a pre-opener,

05:23.547 --> 05:24.880
so you'll just do three songs and get off.

05:24.948 --> 05:26.749
I'm gonna send a couple of
my band members with you,

05:26.817 --> 05:29.051
so until we get your band
together, you'll be covered.

05:29.118 --> 05:30.219
Thank you.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.120
Do you think I'm ready for this?

05:32.188 --> 05:33.588
We... we haven't even been in the studio.

05:33.656 --> 05:35.190
I thought we would do that first, and I...

05:35.258 --> 05:36.491
I do think you're ready.

05:36.559 --> 05:39.427
This is an amazing opportunity for you,

05:39.495 --> 05:40.762
and Luke Wheeler is the biggest tour

05:40.830 --> 05:42.865
- in the country right now.
- Mm-hmm.

05:42.932 --> 05:44.166
Can't pass that up.

05:44.234 --> 05:45.433
I... I know. I just...

05:45.501 --> 05:48.236
Honestly, I just really
wanna make you proud.

05:48.303 --> 05:51.339
I am so proud to have you on my label.

05:51.407 --> 05:52.841
And you are gonna kill it.

05:52.908 --> 05:54.909
Mm-hmm. (Inhales deeply) Okay.

05:54.977 --> 05:56.110
Okay?

05:56.178 --> 05:57.111
(Both laugh)

06:00.449 --> 06:01.816
Bobby Delmont is way too
important in this market.

06:01.884 --> 06:03.751
I can't have him giving
all my airtime to Layla.

06:03.818 --> 06:06.254
Okay, don't worry about it.
She's just a shiny new toy.

06:06.321 --> 06:08.289
You're the superstar
here. Delmont knows it.

06:08.357 --> 06:10.291
- Is he gonna be at the meet and greet?
- Yeah.

06:10.359 --> 06:14.595
Good. I'll talk to him then.
He's a sucker for an exclusive.

06:14.662 --> 06:16.663
Charlie Wentworth.

06:16.731 --> 06:18.332
What in the world are you doing here?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.300
Well, I had a business
meeting here in Houston,

06:20.368 --> 06:21.635
and I saw in the papers
that you were performing,

06:21.703 --> 06:23.637
so I thought I'd swing by and say hello.

06:23.705 --> 06:25.372
- (Indistinct conversations)
- Glenn, right?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.374
Yeah. Good to see you again, Mr. Wentworth.

06:27.442 --> 06:28.842
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, would you like to see the show tonight?

06:28.910 --> 06:30.644
I can send over some tickets.

06:30.712 --> 06:33.179
And then maybe you and Olivia
can join me for a late dinner?

06:33.247 --> 06:36.082
Sorry. Can't. Olivia's on a
girls' weekend in New York,

06:36.150 --> 06:39.052
and I have to fly to Dallas to
speak at a T.E.D. conference.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.253
Well, that's a bummer.

06:42.689 --> 06:45.558
Well... uh... I'll let you two catch up.

06:45.626 --> 06:47.127
- Good to see you again.
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.935
Okay, I'm sorry. I know this is reckless.

06:56.002 --> 06:58.738
- I just really wanted to see you...
- I invented "reckless."

06:58.806 --> 07:00.306
(Grunts) Mmm.

07:00.373 --> 07:03.375
We've gotta move fast. I've
got a press thing in an hour.

07:03.444 --> 07:04.677
You can blow it off.

07:04.745 --> 07:06.813
No. You have no idea how important

07:06.880 --> 07:08.347
these big market radio guys are.

07:08.415 --> 07:10.349
You want on the air, you
have to play by their rules.

07:10.417 --> 07:14.653
Um, hello? Media mogul.
My company owns... 800...

07:14.720 --> 07:17.256
(Kisses) radio stations. I
think I know how things work.

07:17.324 --> 07:18.424
Mm. (Breathing heavily)

07:18.491 --> 07:21.726
But surely you're above all that.

07:21.794 --> 07:25.263
<i>You're a huge, huge star.
They should be courting you.</i>

07:25.331 --> 07:26.765
(Both panting)

07:26.833 --> 07:29.568
You're right. They should be.

07:29.635 --> 07:33.438
It's about time they
showed me some respect.

07:33.506 --> 07:37.275
Exactly. Juliette Barnes is
the new queen of country music.

07:37.343 --> 07:39.478
She shouldn't have to bow down to anybody.

07:39.545 --> 07:41.579
Oh, is that right?

07:41.646 --> 07:44.382
I shouldn't have to bow down to anybody?

07:44.450 --> 07:46.717
(Buckle clicking) Oh, I mean, you know,

07:46.785 --> 07:48.919
if Juliette Barnes wants to... bow down.

07:48.988 --> 07:51.522
(Inhales sharply)

07:51.625 --> 07:53.326
(Rayna) You girls ready?

07:53.394 --> 07:54.894
Your dad's here! Come on down.

07:54.961 --> 07:56.762
What time you gonna bring 'em back today?

07:56.830 --> 07:58.096
Uh, around 3:00.

07:58.164 --> 08:00.032
We just need to pick up
their dresses and shoes,

08:00.099 --> 08:02.267
- and then we're gonna grab lunch while we're out.
- Mm-kay.

08:02.335 --> 08:05.504
Um... little word of warning.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.773
I don't think Maddie wants
to sing at your reception.

08:07.841 --> 08:09.942
What? When did that happen?

08:10.010 --> 08:11.276
This morning. I talked to her about it,

08:11.344 --> 08:12.977
but she seems pretty determined.

08:12.978 --> 08:15.175
- And did she say why?
- Not really, but you know...

08:15.176 --> 08:17.190
- (Lowered voice) Listen, she's upset about this wedding.
- (Sighs)

08:17.193 --> 08:19.117
I think she sees it as
you marrying the woman

08:19.185 --> 08:20.852
- who broke up our marriage.
- Oh, okay.

08:20.920 --> 08:21.952
Maddie knows that's not what happened.

08:22.008 --> 08:23.132
I don't want to get into this with you.

08:23.150 --> 08:24.284
- I'm just telling you...
- I don't want to get into it either,

08:24.351 --> 08:25.451
but, Rayna, I'm getting married tomorrow

08:25.519 --> 08:26.886
in front of a lot of important people.

08:26.954 --> 08:28.254
A show of support from
the girls would be nice.

08:28.322 --> 08:30.355
Oh, come on now. You're
not worried about this

08:30.424 --> 08:31.947
'cause it's gonna make you
look bad in the press, are you?

08:31.948 --> 08:32.448
That's not what I said.

08:32.452 --> 08:34.653
- Okay.
- The show of support is for Peggy.

08:34.660 --> 08:35.480
I mean, it would mean a lot to her.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.921
Oh, so it means a lot to
Peggy, so you're gonna force

08:36.922 --> 08:38.660
- our daughter to do something she doesn't wanna do?
- Force our daughter?

08:38.664 --> 08:39.799
- Seems like it.
- I get it.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.567
- Oh, you are ridiculous.
- This is your way of turning the girls against Peggy.

08:41.635 --> 08:43.469
No. Hey, this is not my
fault. You got Peggy pregnant,

08:44.126 --> 08:45.827
you wanna run for congress,
you're gonna marry her, fine.

08:45.895 --> 08:47.962
That is your choice,

08:48.030 --> 08:49.363
but Maddie is not a little girl anymore,

08:49.431 --> 08:50.732
and she can make choices, too.

08:50.799 --> 08:52.066
And if she doesn't wanna
sing at your wedding,

08:52.134 --> 08:53.134
- you have to respect that.
- (Daphne) Hey, dad!

08:53.201 --> 08:55.003
- Hey. You look ready.
- Ready! Yep.

08:55.070 --> 08:57.805
Yes, you are. Ahh! How about
your sister? She ready to go?

08:57.873 --> 09:00.141
Um, I don't know. She
said she didn't wanna come.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.976
What? All right, let me talk to her.

09:02.044 --> 09:03.844
I'll go talk to her. Be right back.

09:09.518 --> 09:12.086
Hey.

09:12.154 --> 09:14.188
Do you wanna talk about it?

09:18.226 --> 09:19.393
He's leaving us.

09:19.461 --> 09:21.127
He's not, honey. He's your father.

09:21.195 --> 09:22.829
He's always gonna be your father.

09:22.897 --> 09:25.131
- That's never gonna change.
- How do you know that?

09:25.199 --> 09:28.035
Talia's dad got remarried,
and he's never around anymore.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.128
The new wife's always
gonna be more important.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.562
(Huffs)

09:32.630 --> 09:34.397
What if they have kids of their own?

09:34.465 --> 09:35.732
Is he gonna make time for me

09:35.800 --> 09:37.600
when I'm not even his daughter?

09:37.668 --> 09:40.637
(Scoffs)

09:40.704 --> 09:42.672
Mom...

09:42.739 --> 09:44.874
I wanna see Deacon.

09:46.759 --> 09:53.701
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:01.098 --> 10:02.265
This is big.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.133
Deacon is her father.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.870
It makes sense that she
wants to connect with him.

10:06.937 --> 10:09.406
Yeah. I don't know what he wants.

10:09.473 --> 10:11.140
Does he wanna be a father right now?

10:11.208 --> 10:13.542
Does he feel welcome?

10:13.610 --> 10:15.544
Probably not.

10:15.612 --> 10:18.180
- Is that what you want?
- I just wanna...

10:18.248 --> 10:20.482
protect myself...

10:20.550 --> 10:22.851
protect my family.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.221
Wish I could just...

10:25.289 --> 10:27.923
put him off in a box somewhere and...

10:30.427 --> 10:32.327
not have to think about it anymore.

10:32.395 --> 10:34.496
Because if Maddie has
a relationship with him,

10:34.564 --> 10:36.998
then that means you have to
have a relationship with him.

10:37.066 --> 10:42.237
I'm gonna have to open that box.

10:42.305 --> 10:44.806
<i>(Juliette) * stumble outta that red door *</i>

10:44.873 --> 10:47.375
<i>* hop into a cab *</i>

10:47.443 --> 10:48.944
Mmnh.

10:49.011 --> 10:51.146
She is not that much taller than me.

10:51.213 --> 10:52.447
(Under breath) You're late.

10:52.514 --> 10:53.982
I'm the headliner. I'm allowed to be late.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.283
Hi, guys. (Under breath)
Where's Santa Claus?

10:55.351 --> 10:56.684
(Glenn) He's here. Never misses a chance

10:56.752 --> 10:58.286
to rub elbows with the stars.

10:58.354 --> 11:00.588
- Mm, he never stops at the elbows, of course.
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.591 --> 11:01.791
I am sick and tired

11:01.859 --> 11:03.793
of having to giggle like
a teenager for that pig.

11:03.861 --> 11:05.528
It's time he showed me a little respect.

11:05.596 --> 11:08.631
(Sighs) I'm not gonna like
what happens next, am I? Mm.

11:08.699 --> 11:12.402
Oh, Juliette, you look amazing.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.137
I mean, really, really good.

11:15.205 --> 11:16.571
Uh, thank you, Mr. Delmont.

11:16.639 --> 11:18.707
Please take your hands off of me.

11:18.775 --> 11:20.442
What is your problem?

11:20.510 --> 11:23.312
No problem. I'm just not
17 and desperate anymore.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.980
Hey, guys, how are you?

11:25.048 --> 11:27.749
(Man) Hey, Juliette! Good to see you.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.251
Hi. Juliette. Nice to meet you.

11:29.319 --> 11:30.852
- Layla Grant? Bobby Delmont. KCUT.
- Hi.

11:30.921 --> 11:32.388
- How are you?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

11:32.455 --> 11:33.789
(Clears throat) Nice to meet you.

11:33.856 --> 11:35.590
I hear that you have the
most powerful microphone

11:35.658 --> 11:37.058
in all of Texas.

11:37.126 --> 11:38.393
Well, I don't know about the most powerful,

11:38.461 --> 11:39.828
but it's certainly the biggest.

11:39.896 --> 11:42.497
(Giggles) Mr. Delmont,
you're making me blush.

11:42.565 --> 11:44.933
Ah, I don't mean to make you blush.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.334
(Knock on door)

11:48.370 --> 11:49.603
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:49.671 --> 11:51.205
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

11:51.273 --> 11:53.341
- How you doing?
- (Door closes)

11:53.409 --> 11:54.909
<i>- I'm good. You know, I've been...
- (Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

11:54.977 --> 11:56.877
Going to meetings, things.

11:56.946 --> 11:59.780
- (Turns off TV)
- Oh. Well, I wasn't checking up on you or anything.

11:59.848 --> 12:01.715
- You okay?
- Um... yeah.

12:01.783 --> 12:03.985
- Teddy's getting married tomorrow, so...
- I heard.

12:04.053 --> 12:08.188
And... you know Maddie's
been having a hard time.

12:08.256 --> 12:10.958
And, uh, she asked about you, and...

12:11.025 --> 12:13.427
I think she really wants to see you.

12:13.495 --> 12:16.296
I just wanna find out
how you feel about that.

12:16.364 --> 12:18.599
<i>How do you feel about it?</i>

12:18.732 --> 12:21.266
It worries me.

12:21.334 --> 12:23.668
I don't know if it's the right thing

12:23.736 --> 12:26.171
for her... for us.

12:26.239 --> 12:27.305
You're worried about me.

12:27.373 --> 12:29.274
It's okay.

12:29.342 --> 12:31.776
I understand.

12:31.844 --> 12:34.379
She's my daughter. I don't wanna hurt her.

12:34.447 --> 12:36.648
It's a lot easier when
I was Uncle Deacon, huh?

12:36.715 --> 12:38.016
(Chuckles)

12:38.084 --> 12:39.951
I'd teach her a chord, and she'd give me

12:40.019 --> 12:41.553
that big smile of hers.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.188
Yeah, there was a lot
that used to be easier.

12:44.256 --> 12:45.924
I wanna do right by her,
Ray. I wanna do this thing.

12:45.991 --> 12:47.324
But I just...

12:47.392 --> 12:50.227
I feel like I gotta bring
something to the table.

12:50.295 --> 12:51.863
I gotta be someone she can be proud of...

12:51.931 --> 12:54.567
Yeah, I just need to know
that she can count on you.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.434
'Cause I'm not gonna open up that door

12:56.502 --> 12:58.302
if I think there's a chance
you might close it on her.

13:01.173 --> 13:03.274
So I'd like you to think about that.

13:10.616 --> 13:12.216
Look, I know you want the girls to sing,

13:12.284 --> 13:13.751
but Maddie doesn't wanna do it.

13:13.818 --> 13:15.819
I mean, I think this was all
just happening too fast for her.

13:15.888 --> 13:17.288
Maddie is going to be fine.

13:17.356 --> 13:19.223
You know she wouldn't even
come downstairs to talk to me?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.225
So you wanna postpone? Is
that what you're saying?

13:21.293 --> 13:22.826
(Sighs) Yeah, it's...
oh... I'm... what I...

13:22.895 --> 13:24.362
- (woman) Good morning, Mr. Mayor.
- Hey, how you doing?

13:24.429 --> 13:27.365
I don't know what I'm
saying. All I know is that

13:27.432 --> 13:30.166
she is clearly not
happy about this wedding.

13:30.234 --> 13:32.903
Ah. (Scoffs) Teddy, she is a teenage girl,

13:33.060 --> 13:35.362
and her daddy is getting remarried.

13:35.429 --> 13:38.198
I mean, of course she's
gonna feel a little jealous.

13:38.265 --> 13:42.469
But postponing? That
sends the wrong message...

13:42.537 --> 13:44.704
- (Man) Morning, Mr. Mayor.
- To Maddie, to your constituents.

13:44.771 --> 13:46.072
- My constituents?
- Yeah.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.840
Are you serious? We're
talking about my daughter here.

13:47.908 --> 13:51.344
Look, you're the one that
wanted to run for Congress, okay?

13:51.412 --> 13:53.613
(Sighs) Think about it.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.216
A last minute cancellation
suggests indecisiveness.

13:56.283 --> 13:58.084
I didn't say anything about canceling.

13:58.152 --> 13:59.685
- Well... (Huffs) postponing would be even worse.
- (Woman) Morning, sir.

13:59.753 --> 14:03.556
You wanna walk your 6-month
pregnant girlfriend down the aisle?

14:03.624 --> 14:05.958
Or better yet, you wanna
have a child out of wedlock?

14:06.026 --> 14:08.293
Do any of those scenarios
help your chances?

14:08.361 --> 14:09.629
Listen to me.

14:09.696 --> 14:12.164
I just want my daughter
to be happy, that's all.

14:12.232 --> 14:15.100
I know. I know you do,
and... (Scoffs) believe me.

14:15.168 --> 14:17.903
- Maddie is going to be just fine.
- (Man) Morning, sir.

14:17.970 --> 14:20.072
As soon as the ceremony's over,

14:20.140 --> 14:22.774
she is gonna accept that we are together.

14:22.842 --> 14:24.776
Things are gonna settle down,

14:24.844 --> 14:26.311
and then we get to be a real family...

14:26.379 --> 14:30.082
you and me and the girls and our baby.

14:30.150 --> 14:31.016
Okay?

14:36.011 --> 14:37.612
(Knock on door) Come on in!

14:37.679 --> 14:38.813
(Door closes)

14:44.086 --> 14:45.987
Just sit down.

14:46.055 --> 14:47.155
(Sighs)

14:47.223 --> 14:48.757
(Inhales deeply)

14:48.824 --> 14:50.625
Listen, Deacon, a... about this mornin'...

14:50.692 --> 14:51.892
I don't wanna talk about this morning...

14:51.960 --> 14:53.927
Ever. Okay?

14:57.532 --> 14:59.700
(Sighs) What am I doing here then?

15:05.006 --> 15:06.206
You still play guitar?

15:06.275 --> 15:08.142
Yeah. Every day.

15:08.334 --> 15:10.135
Good. How would you like
to come play guitar for me

15:10.203 --> 15:12.137
tomorrow night at an open mic?

15:12.205 --> 15:14.672
You want me to... play guitar...

15:14.740 --> 15:17.609
- That's what I'm asking.
- You know, like, every player in town.

15:17.676 --> 15:19.444
Well, yeah, I do, but there's a good chance

15:19.512 --> 15:20.779
I'm gonna look like an idiot,

15:20.846 --> 15:22.147
and I would rather not do that

15:22.215 --> 15:24.048
in front of people I know and respect.

15:24.116 --> 15:25.650
No offense.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.519
Okay. But the Bluebird

15:27.586 --> 15:31.188
is gonna be filled with
people that know you.

15:31.256 --> 15:32.724
That's why I'm not
doing it at the Bluebird.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.325
I'm doing it at Shotgun
Sally's, Murfreesboro.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.560
Murfreesboro?

15:35.628 --> 15:36.861
- Why?
- Did you miss the part

15:36.929 --> 15:38.563
about me not wanting to look like an idiot?

15:38.631 --> 15:40.064
Right, but I'm... but
I'm just saying that if

15:40.132 --> 15:43.234
you're so sure that you're
gonna look... like...

15:43.302 --> 15:45.937
stupid or whatever, then why not wait?

15:46.004 --> 15:47.338
Maybe I need to do this
right now, all right?

15:47.406 --> 15:49.740
Is that all right with
you? I'm just asking you

15:49.808 --> 15:53.110

17:59.813 --> 18:02.915
Man, Santa's thumbs must be
burning from typing so much.

18:02.983 --> 18:04.384
"Leaving after Layla's set.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.786
Can't be topped, so why
not beat the traffic?"

18:06.853 --> 18:08.621
"Did anyone stay for Juliette Barnes' set?

18:08.689 --> 18:10.390
If so, why?"

18:10.457 --> 18:11.824
"Wouldn't wanna be
Juliette Barnes last night,

18:11.892 --> 18:14.060
having to take the stage
after sly, sexy Layla Grant."

18:14.127 --> 18:16.595
(Clears throat) Hey. Can
you put that thing away?

18:16.663 --> 18:18.530
Come have some breakfast.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.500
This is your fault, you know that?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.869
<i>You were the one who
told me to blow him off,</i>

18:23.937 --> 18:26.271
and now I'm remembering why
you give Santa what he wants.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.472
Okay, stop.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.008
Who is Santa?

18:29.076 --> 18:30.475
And why are we calling him that?

18:30.543 --> 18:31.810
Bobby Delmont at KCUT,

18:31.877 --> 18:34.045
and people in the business
call him "Santa Claus"

18:34.113 --> 18:36.715
because young girls have to
sit on his lap to get airplay.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.317
You're kidding me.

18:38.384 --> 18:41.186
You say that you know how this works?

18:41.254 --> 18:42.688
You don't.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.791
You have no idea what it's like
being a girl in this business.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.827
Everybody else holds the cards...

18:48.894 --> 18:51.395
the labels, the managers, the programmers.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.866
And you just have to play nice and beg,

18:54.934 --> 18:58.703
and if you're pretty, sometimes
you're asked to do more.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.939
So you just smile and pretend

19:01.006 --> 19:04.442
<i>that you don't hate
everybody who's using you.</i>

19:04.509 --> 19:07.778
<i>That... that is how it works, Charlie.</i>

19:07.846 --> 19:09.179
<i>That is my life.</i>

19:11.983 --> 19:13.251
Look, I just want you to know,

19:13.318 --> 19:15.653
Jeff, I'm not trying
to jerk you around here.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.154
Good, 'cause I don't
like to be jerked around.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.056
So what's the problem?

19:19.124 --> 19:23.060
Well, the... the truth is,
I was, um, saving the song

19:23.128 --> 19:25.262
to, uh, release it myself.

19:25.329 --> 19:29.166
I'm a... I'm a singer, and
I'm not looking for a handout

19:29.234 --> 19:31.368
or anything like that, but
if you like what you hear,

19:31.435 --> 19:33.603
maybe we can... we can work something out.

19:33.671 --> 19:35.239
Like what, exactly?

19:35.306 --> 19:38.708
Uh... I was thinking like
a... like a record deal

19:38.776 --> 19:40.477
or maybe you can use your influence

19:40.544 --> 19:43.513
to help get me on a tour.
I could, uh... I could be

19:43.581 --> 19:45.982
the opening-opening-opening
act for Juliette.

19:47.618 --> 19:50.920
I'm just looking for a
break. (Clears throat) So...

19:50.988 --> 19:53.990
if you can help in any way, uh...

19:54.057 --> 19:56.225
The song's yours.

19:56.293 --> 19:59.162
(Piano playing light jazz)

20:05.769 --> 20:09.471
Wow. You look beautiful.

20:09.539 --> 20:10.806
Thank you.

20:13.610 --> 20:15.043
(Sighs) Listen, honey,

20:15.111 --> 20:18.046
I... I know this is all
going way too fast for you.

20:18.114 --> 20:21.817
Maybe you think that I don't
care about your feelings.

20:21.884 --> 20:24.753
But believe me, I do.

20:24.821 --> 20:27.856
I care very much about you.

20:27.924 --> 20:30.158
But I care about Peggy, too.

20:30.226 --> 20:33.361
Can you please just give her a chance?

20:33.429 --> 20:36.097
I can try.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.334
Let me help you with that.

20:41.437 --> 20:44.339
There.

20:44.406 --> 20:46.708
You were my first girl. You know that.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.880
You will always be my first girl.

20:54.516 --> 20:55.883
Come here.

21:00.521 --> 21:05.092
(Luke) Yeah, I bought this place
a few years back after my divorce.

21:05.160 --> 21:09.196
700 acres, about 3 times
more than I wanted. (Laughs)

21:09.444 --> 21:12.913
But this spot right here...
this is why I bought the place.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.730
I can see why.

21:14.777 --> 21:17.211
(Gasps) Oh, this is beautiful.

21:17.214 --> 21:19.716
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

21:19.719 --> 21:21.820
Sometimes I can't believe
I get to live here.

21:21.888 --> 21:23.822
(Laughs) Luckiest bastard on the planet.

21:23.890 --> 21:25.156
Well, I think you and I
both know this doesn't have

21:25.224 --> 21:26.491
- very much to do with luck.
- (Laughs)

21:26.559 --> 21:28.493
- So that's your house right there.
- Yeah.

21:28.561 --> 21:29.994
Now what's that over there?

21:30.062 --> 21:31.629
Uh, stables. Well, one of 'em.

21:31.696 --> 21:32.964
I got a large one set a ways back.

21:33.032 --> 21:35.366
All right, I'm starting to get
the impression you like horses.

21:35.434 --> 21:36.600
What can I say? Grew up in Kentucky.

21:36.668 --> 21:38.403
Horses are my passion.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.238
You know, it was actually a horse that, uh,

21:40.306 --> 21:41.839
got me signed with Edgehill?

21:41.907 --> 21:44.309
Yep, Jeff Fordham sent over
the grandson of a derby winner.

21:44.376 --> 21:45.476
Couldn't say no to that.

21:45.544 --> 21:46.677
Yeah, that Jeff Fordham...

21:46.745 --> 21:48.446
he really knows how to get what he wants.

21:48.513 --> 21:50.948
- What, you don't like Jeff?
- I don't like anybody right now. (Laughs)

21:51.015 --> 21:52.750
Ha ha. Why not?

21:52.818 --> 21:54.685
Oh. It's just...

21:54.753 --> 21:57.187
ind of a strange day.

21:57.255 --> 21:59.389
My ex-husband is getting remarried today.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.258
Probably right about now, actually.

22:01.326 --> 22:02.392
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

22:02.461 --> 22:03.694
Whew. Man.

22:03.762 --> 22:05.628
Same thing happened to me last year.

22:05.696 --> 22:07.097
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:07.165 --> 22:09.599
You, uh, like the new wife?

22:09.667 --> 22:11.734
(Scoffs) You like the new husband?

22:11.802 --> 22:13.202
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah.

22:13.270 --> 22:15.605
You know, uh, having
been through this myself,

22:15.673 --> 22:17.340
I could give you some advice.

22:17.407 --> 22:20.076
- What's that?
- It's all about finding a coping mechanism.

22:20.143 --> 22:24.080
Something that'll take
your mind off it completely.

23:42.623 --> 23:45.459
This is beautiful. Hey, did
you hear about Bobby Delmont?

23:45.527 --> 23:46.693
- No.
- Just got fired.

23:46.761 --> 23:48.161
- You're kidding me.
- No.

23:48.228 --> 23:51.064

was getting a little too cozy

(Elevator bell dings)

Hey.

23:58.940 --> 24:00.173
Hey.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.809
Missed you at dinner last night.

24:02.877 --> 24:04.177
I doubt that.

24:04.244 --> 24:06.645
Who was that guy? You
pick him up off the street?

24:06.713 --> 24:09.048
No. As a matter of fact,

24:09.116 --> 24:10.883
we've been dating in Nashville.

24:10.951 --> 24:14.253
Thought it'd be nice
to take a trip together.

24:14.321 --> 24:16.322
Oh, so he's your boyfriend?

24:16.390 --> 24:18.458
Why do you care?

24:18.525 --> 24:21.293
No, I don't care. Pfft. I
was just making conversation.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.630
Yes, Craig is my boyfriend.

24:24.698 --> 24:28.467
Unlike some people, I like
my romantic relationships

24:28.534 --> 24:30.569
to actually mean something.

(Both laughing)

24:46.685 --> 24:47.952
Whoo!

24:48.020 --> 24:49.787
I have not shot a gun
since I must have been 10

24:49.855 --> 24:52.857
when my granddaddy tried to
teach me how to shoot skeet.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.425
Well, you are a damn good shot.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.994
(Laughs) Well...

24:56.061 --> 24:57.394
I don't know if I'm
gonna make a habit of it.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.763
I'm not much of a gun girl,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.598
but what else you got around here?

25:00.666 --> 25:01.966
(Laughs) What else is there to
do to take my mind off everything?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.035
See? It's all about distraction.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.438
(Sighs) Yeah. Yeah. This has been helpful.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.242
Yeah. Uh, you know, it does get easier.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.843
I mean, dealing with
the ex and the in-law,

25:12.910 --> 25:15.412
and... co-parenting
with a virtual stranger.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.547
Oh, man. I can't even...

25:16.615 --> 25:18.382
I don't even know what that looks like.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.317
Oh, it's an adjustment, I'll tell you that.

25:20.385 --> 25:21.818
Suddenly, because someone else says so,

25:21.886 --> 25:22.919
you gotta hand over the keys to your kids

25:22.987 --> 25:24.388
like it's no big deal.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.689
That scares the hell out of me.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.590
Yeah, of course it does.
You want your kids to be

25:27.659 --> 25:29.626
safe and happy and loved.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.663
Who could ever do that better than you?

25:32.730 --> 25:34.097
- (Bottle clanks)
- Nobody.

25:34.165 --> 25:36.566
Exactly, which is why...

25:36.634 --> 25:39.636
you gotta cut the rest of
the world a little slack.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.672
Otherwise, you will just go crazy.

25:41.739 --> 25:43.673
You surprise me.

25:44.941 --> 25:47.743
- This whole place surprises me. (Chuckles)
- (Chuckles)

25:47.811 --> 25:49.679
Me being here surprises me.

25:49.746 --> 25:53.883
I'm, uh, hoping maybe that's a good thing?

26:12.735 --> 26:13.803

26:13.870 --> 26:15.404
(avery) I gotta ask, why Shotgun Sally's?

26:15.471 --> 26:17.706
It's the first place I ever
got the nerve to get up onstage.

26:17.774 --> 26:20.141
- It was an open mic night.
- How'd it go?

26:20.209 --> 26:22.110
- What?
- How'd it go?

26:22.178 --> 26:25.113
Good. You know? It was good.
I played something I wrote.

26:25.181 --> 26:27.416
I thought they'd kick me out. They didn't.

26:27.483 --> 26:30.051
They listened. Good a
place as any to start over.

26:30.119 --> 26:31.319
Have you even set foot in the Bluebird

26:31.386 --> 26:32.821
since the accident?

26:32.888 --> 26:34.823
You know, just for a cup of coffee?

26:34.890 --> 26:37.826
You know, folks there still
talk about you all the time.

26:37.893 --> 26:40.594
- They miss you.
- They miss the Deacon they used to know...

26:40.662 --> 26:44.065
guitar hero, Rayna's side man.
That guy's not around anymore.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.667
So what, you're never going back?

26:46.735 --> 26:48.035
You're just gonna avoid

26:48.102 --> 26:49.537
anyone who knew you before the accident?

26:49.604 --> 26:51.405
That's, uh, that's a great plan.

26:51.473 --> 26:52.906
Hey. You think I don't wanna go back, huh?

26:52.974 --> 26:54.809
You think... you think I
don't miss those people myself?

26:54.876 --> 26:56.910
Okay, then. What's stopping you?

26:57.148 --> 26:59.817
There's a look that people get

26:59.885 --> 27:02.052
when you disappoint them.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.222
It's in their eyes, on
their face, you know?

27:05.289 --> 27:08.791
I'm just tired of that damn look.

27:28.245 --> 27:30.713
- Dad looks so happy, doesn't he?
- Yeah.

27:30.781 --> 27:33.115
He does.

27:33.183 --> 27:35.084
Come on.

27:35.152 --> 27:36.786
What?

27:36.854 --> 27:39.688
Oh, wow. Thank you,
everybody, so much for coming.

27:39.756 --> 27:41.857
Really, it means a lot
to have you all here,

27:41.925 --> 27:43.792
celebrating with us on this special day.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.661
So thank you for being here.

27:45.728 --> 27:47.930
(Amplified voice) Excuse me, everyone.

27:47.997 --> 27:50.732
Hi. My name is Maddie Conrad,

27:50.800 --> 27:53.202
and this is my sister Daphne.

27:53.270 --> 27:53.759
(Amplified voice) Hello.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.523
In case you haven't heard,
our dad just got married today.

27:56.973 --> 27:58.907
(Laughter) I know you're
supposed to write a speech

27:58.975 --> 28:01.376
or make a toast when someone gets married,

28:01.444 --> 28:03.979
but, um, since I'm not
allowed to drink yet...

28:04.047 --> 28:04.980
No, no. (Laughter)

28:05.048 --> 28:06.448
And I'm not much of a talker,

28:06.515 --> 28:09.484
I thought maybe we'd do
things a little differently.

28:09.552 --> 28:12.019
Daddy... this one's for you.

Did you fire Bobby Delmont?

28:53.261 --> 28:55.229
(Door slams) Sam, I'll call you back.

28:55.296 --> 28:57.498
Aren't you supposed to be at your, um...

28:57.565 --> 28:59.933
I looked it up, and KCUT is
owned by a Wentworth subsidiary.

29:00.001 --> 29:02.435
I'm gonna ask you one more
time. Did you fire Bobby Delmont?

29:02.503 --> 29:04.070
Yeah, I did. He's a lech and a tool,

29:04.138 --> 29:06.039
and you should be thanking me.

29:06.107 --> 29:08.608
Thanking you? I do not need
you to fight my battles for me!

29:08.676 --> 29:10.977
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I
was just trying to help.

29:11.045 --> 29:12.378
If you wanna help me,

29:12.446 --> 29:15.015
then you will give Delmont
back his job immediately.

29:15.082 --> 29:17.250
(Door opens and slams)

29:17.317 --> 29:19.952
I think I like this coping mechanism

29:20.020 --> 29:22.388
even better than that last one.

29:29.663 --> 29:33.899
- Mmm.
- (Cell phone rings)

29:33.967 --> 29:36.869
(Ring)

29:36.936 --> 29:38.236
Hey, sweet girl.

29:38.304 --> 29:39.937
I sang for dad.

29:40.005 --> 29:41.572
You did?

29:41.640 --> 29:44.709
Oh, I'm really proud of you.

29:44.777 --> 29:46.177
Thanks, mom.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.511
You all right?

29:47.579 --> 29:49.781
Can you come pick me up?

29:49.848 --> 29:51.549
You don't wanna go to Talia's, huh?

29:51.616 --> 29:53.551
I'm not really much in the sleepover mood.

29:53.618 --> 29:55.586
Can I just come home instead?

29:55.654 --> 29:58.289
You sure can, honey.
I'll be right there, okay?

29:58.356 --> 29:59.823
Thanks, mom.

29:59.891 --> 30:01.292
All right. I love you.

30:01.359 --> 30:03.527
I love you, too.

30:03.595 --> 30:07.998
Go. Kids come first.

(Indistinct conversations)

30:29.320 --> 30:30.920
Are you kidding me?

30:30.987 --> 30:34.924
(Man speaking indistinctly)

30:34.991 --> 30:36.859
- It's a comedy club.
- Yep.

<i>When the hell did that happen?</i>

30:38.462 --> 30:40.029
<i>It is open mic night.</i>

30:44.935 --> 30:47.536
I made popcorn. You wanna come downstairs?

30:47.604 --> 30:50.639
We can have a little
mother-daughter movie night.

30:50.707 --> 30:54.676
Um... I'd really rather
just read, if that's cool.

Yeah.

<i>(Deacon) * I have a life that's good *</i>

31:06.055 --> 31:08.990
Mom, um...

31:09.058 --> 31:11.560
do you think that Deacon
will ever look at me

31:11.628 --> 31:13.895
the way that dad looks at Daphne?

31:13.963 --> 31:18.833
So many questions we don't
know the answers to, huh?

31:18.901 --> 31:20.601
We made some decisions a long time ago

31:20.669 --> 31:23.571
that are really impacting
your life right now,

31:23.639 --> 31:28.743
and I am... so sorry...

31:31.346 --> 31:34.382
that it... has caused
you even an ounce of pain.

31:34.449 --> 31:37.318
But we're gonna make it right together.

31:37.386 --> 31:38.686
I promise you.

31:41.323 --> 31:42.523
Okay.

31:45.226 --> 31:47.695
- Want some popcorn?
- Yeah. (Chuckles)

31:47.763 --> 31:49.463
Are you sure you don't wanna watch a movie?

31:49.531 --> 31:51.165
Go downstairs, pick out whatever you want.

31:51.232 --> 31:53.500
- Okay.
- As long as it's not scary.

31:53.567 --> 31:55.435
(Chuckles) Please.

31:55.503 --> 31:57.037
- Okay.
- I get scared.

31:57.105 --> 31:58.438
(Laughs) I know.

31:58.506 --> 31:59.973
(Sighs) You know what this is?

32:00.041 --> 32:01.374
(Avery) Mm? It's a sign.

32:01.442 --> 32:03.977
It's a... it's a change of ownership.

32:04.045 --> 32:05.745
No, it's a sign, all right?

32:05.814 --> 32:06.713
It's a sign that I shouldn't be doing this.

32:06.781 --> 32:08.114
- Come on.
- (Cell phone rings)

32:08.182 --> 32:10.450
Hold on.

Hey. Everything all right?

32:13.053 --> 32:15.254
Well, yeah and no.

32:15.323 --> 32:17.490
You and I have been doing a real good job

32:17.558 --> 32:20.059
keeping our distance

32:20.127 --> 32:22.094
and moving on with our lives,

32:22.162 --> 32:24.897
but we're just not
gonna be able to do that.

32:24.965 --> 32:26.632
We have a daughter together. (Sighs)

32:26.700 --> 32:28.935
She's asking for you.

32:29.002 --> 32:31.003
She wants her father.

32:33.707 --> 32:36.209

Aw, come on! Come on!

- See, I told you.
- (Man) No, no, no. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

32:50.293 --> 32:53.396
Look, you guys gotta have some
faith in the team, all right?

32:53.463 --> 32:55.063
Don't listen to him.

32:55.131 --> 32:56.198
- (Man) They gotta score something.
- I'm happy you're here.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.232
I missed you so much.

<i>(Man) Hell, no. Come on.</i>

33:04.407 --> 33:06.775
- A bottle of wine, hot tub...
- (Man) Oh, come on.

33:06.842 --> 33:08.743
It's gonna be really fun and relaxing.

33:08.811 --> 33:10.845
Oh, you two must not be from around here.

Hey, he's talking to you, Nancy.

Hey. We're just here to have dinner.

33:19.956 --> 33:22.023
So was I, until you two pervs came in here

33:22.090 --> 33:23.525
and made me lose my appetite.

33:23.592 --> 33:24.759
(Craig) Let's just go.

33:24.827 --> 33:26.861
No. We have every right to be here.

<i>True, but we have every
right not to want you here.</i>

33:30.065 --> 33:32.467
So why don't you pack
up your little dresses

33:32.535 --> 33:33.968
and go on back to where you came from?

33:35.370 --> 33:36.871
Just charge this to room 906 for me.

33:36.939 --> 33:38.339
Mm-hmm.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.841
What, we got a couple of
sissies over here? (Laughs)

33:40.909 --> 33:43.210
Hey, princess, he's talking to you.

33:43.278 --> 33:45.612
You know, if we keep asking
for the same nights off of work,

33:45.680 --> 33:46.948
people are gonna start to talk.

33:47.015 --> 33:48.482
Yeah? So? What are they gonna say?

33:48.550 --> 33:52.553
That Zoey Dalton got herself
the sexiest guy in town.

33:52.620 --> 33:53.654

Sorry, sorry, sorry. (Clears throat)

34:01.563 --> 34:04.130
- Hello?
- I listened to your demo.

34:04.198 --> 34:05.699
I think you've got potential.

34:05.767 --> 34:07.668
- Really? That's awesome.
- Let me finish.

34:07.735 --> 34:10.235
I said "potential," but
you're not there yet.

34:10.304 --> 34:12.538
Okay, so, um... you... you're not...

34:12.606 --> 34:14.040
you're not interested?

34:14.108 --> 34:15.808
I didn't say that either.

34:15.876 --> 34:17.743
Look, what I wanna do is I
wanna hook you up with a mentor.

34:17.811 --> 34:19.512
A mentor? What does that mean?

34:19.580 --> 34:22.648
That means that I am gonna
be sending you out on the road

34:22.716 --> 34:24.650
to write with an Edgehill artist.

34:24.652 --> 34:25.987
Now by you joining this tour,

34:26.054 --> 34:27.755
you are gonna get a firsthand look

34:27.822 --> 34:29.757
at what it takes to make it at this label.

34:29.824 --> 34:31.559
Then you can use what you've learned

34:31.627 --> 34:33.127
when I arrange to give you a prominent spot

34:33.194 --> 34:35.228
at the Music City Music Festival.

34:35.297 --> 34:37.532
Performing at the festival?

34:37.599 --> 34:40.333
Your own concert in front
of the top executives

34:40.402 --> 34:42.937
from every label in town, including myself.

34:43.004 --> 34:45.572
Now I would call that
a break, wouldn't you?

34:45.639 --> 34:47.607
Mr. Fordham, um...

34:47.675 --> 34:50.277
I think you just scored yourself a song.

34:50.344 --> 34:51.745
(Applause) (Man whistles)

34:51.813 --> 34:54.014
(Amplified voice) Thank you. Thank you.

34:54.081 --> 34:56.583
We got a real special
treat for you guys tonight.

34:56.650 --> 34:57.851
About an hour ago, I got a call

34:57.919 --> 34:59.186
from a really good friend of ours

34:59.254 --> 35:01.387
and a damn good friend of the Bluebird.

35:01.456 --> 35:03.122
He's been gone for quite a while.

35:03.190 --> 35:05.258
We're all happier than hell that he's back.

35:05.326 --> 35:08.795
Y'all make welcome the one
and only Deacon Claybourne.

35:08.863 --> 35:11.264
(Cheering)

35:11.332 --> 35:13.500
(Amplified voice) Thank
y'all. Thank you very much.

35:13.568 --> 35:15.401
All right, okay. All
right. Look, look, stop.

35:15.470 --> 35:16.569
Thank you very much.

35:16.636 --> 35:19.638
I appreciate it. In fact...

35:19.706 --> 35:22.075
I can't even tell you how
much I appreciate it, but, uh,

35:22.142 --> 35:23.809
this place is like my home, and I know

35:23.877 --> 35:25.411
I've been gone from home for a while.

35:25.479 --> 35:27.146
I got no good reason for that. I just...

35:27.214 --> 35:30.350
guess I've been a little
scared. (Clears throat)

35:30.417 --> 35:32.352
I want you to know that...

35:32.419 --> 35:34.987
even though I haven't been around,

35:35.054 --> 35:37.823
that doesn't mean I haven't
been thinking about this moment

35:37.891 --> 35:39.324
every single day.

35:39.392 --> 35:40.826
- (Woman) Bring it home, Deacon!
- (Man shouts indistinctly)

35:40.894 --> 35:43.596
Anyway, uh, I guess we should
jump right on into this.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.131
Uh, as you see, I don't
have my guitar on me,

35:46.199 --> 35:48.367
which is a little unusual... (Chuckles)

35:48.434 --> 35:50.768
But I do got a great guitarist
who's been helping me out.

35:50.836 --> 35:52.304
Avery Barkley, start this off for me.

I did. I thought you
might be curious to know

about a little private
concert I did recently...

37:05.508 --> 37:07.242
for Charles and Olivia Wentworth?

37:07.310 --> 37:09.178
Have you heard of them?

37:09.245 --> 37:10.612
What am I talking about?

37:10.680 --> 37:13.315
Of course you have. They
own your radio station

37:13.383 --> 37:15.517
and most of the other
stations in the country.

37:15.585 --> 37:20.021
Yeah. The Wentworths... they love me.

37:20.089 --> 37:22.523
They'd do just about anything for me...

37:22.592 --> 37:24.392
including firing you.

37:26.095 --> 37:27.862
That's right. I had you fired.

37:27.930 --> 37:30.264
But just to show there
are no hard feelings,

37:30.332 --> 37:31.600
I also had you rehired.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.901
So here's the deal.

37:32.969 --> 37:35.970
If you so much as glance
sideways at another girl,

37:36.037 --> 37:38.506
I will not only have
you permanently fired...

37:38.574 --> 37:40.040
I'll have Charles
Wentworth use his influence

37:40.109 --> 37:42.443
to make sure you never work again.

37:44.146 --> 37:45.379
Do we understand each other?

37:45.447 --> 37:47.381
- Perfectly.
- Good.

37:47.449 --> 37:49.783
Oh! And one more thing.

37:49.851 --> 37:55.022
From now on, I get twice as
much airtime as Layla Grant.

37:55.090 --> 37:58.058
Hmm.

37:58.126 --> 37:59.292
Get out.

38:04.599 --> 38:05.699
(Door closes)

38:17.891 --> 38:20.593
(Speaking indistinctly)

38:20.661 --> 38:21.761
(Laughs)

38:21.829 --> 38:23.863
"I'm not bothering you." Hey, whatever.

38:23.931 --> 38:25.130
You just bump me?

38:25.198 --> 38:26.799
No, you just ran into me, jackass.

38:26.867 --> 38:28.434
- What'd you call me?
- Hey, whoa, whoa, guys. Come on.

38:28.502 --> 38:30.702
I called you a jackass, jackass...

38:30.770 --> 38:33.005
(Grunting) Uhh!

38:33.073 --> 38:34.739
Uhh!

38:34.807 --> 38:39.711
(Grunting)

38:39.779 --> 38:40.980
No, don't!

38:41.047 --> 38:44.416
(Panting)

38:44.484 --> 38:48.019
(Coughs)

38:48.087 --> 38:50.088
(Elevator bell dings)

38:50.155 --> 38:51.422
Excuse me!

38:51.491 --> 38:53.558
Hold the elevator! (Button clicks)

38:53.626 --> 38:55.527
- Oh.
- Well, hey.

38:55.595 --> 38:56.728
How'd your set go?

38:56.796 --> 38:58.897
Just fine.

38:58.965 --> 39:01.132
I... I would've stayed
and watched, but, um,

39:01.200 --> 39:02.500
this deejay came down from Dallas,

39:02.567 --> 39:05.203
and I promised him an exclusive interview.

39:05.270 --> 39:07.671
You know, I did a few "exclusives" myself

39:07.739 --> 39:09.073
when I started out.

39:09.141 --> 39:11.075
Hmm. I wanted airtime. I thought

39:11.143 --> 39:14.012
I didn't have a choice, but you do.

39:14.079 --> 39:16.180
You don't have to deal with that crap.

39:16.248 --> 39:18.016
Anybody treats you like a whore on my tour,

39:18.083 --> 39:20.651
- you come tell me, okay?
- (Exhales)

39:20.719 --> 39:24.989
Guess what? I'm not you.

39:25.056 --> 39:26.356
You can go save someone else.

39:26.424 --> 39:27.558
(Bell dings)

39:32.163 --> 39:34.632
I guess "nice" just ain't my color.

39:39.003 --> 39:41.704
Hey. I was just thinking about you.

39:41.772 --> 39:44.041
- How'd it go tonight?
- It went really great.

39:44.108 --> 39:46.476
And guess what? Rayna came.

39:46.544 --> 39:49.146
- Oh, no kiddin'?
- Nope. She brought one of her kids, too.

39:49.213 --> 39:50.414
(Gasps) Maddie's there with Deacon?

39:50.481 --> 39:52.348
Yeah. He's, uh, talking to Erica right now,

39:52.416 --> 39:54.717
but I think he's gonna stay
and have a bite with them.

39:54.785 --> 39:56.285
Hey, how's the tour bus?

39:56.353 --> 39:59.989
Uh, it's weird. They've
got six bunks up the front,

40:00.057 --> 40:02.324
but they put me in this
little bedroom at the back,

40:02.392 --> 40:03.793
and I mean, I fit in the glove compartment,

40:03.861 --> 40:06.095
and everybody else is
stacked up like firewood.

40:06.163 --> 40:08.097
- I feel terrible about it.
- Scarlett...

40:08.165 --> 40:10.966
You're successful. Enjoy it.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.768
Is this really happening?

40:12.835 --> 40:15.171
Like, am I actually doing this, or...

40:15.238 --> 40:16.638
Yeah. You are.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.041
So don't go getting all nervous about it.

40:19.109 --> 40:21.544
I mean, you're on the
hottest tour of the year.

40:21.611 --> 40:23.912
(Door opens) You got Rayna
Jaymes in your corner.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.047
Trust me.

40:25.114 --> 40:26.748
You got nothing to worry about.

40:26.816 --> 40:29.618
How you doing? What's up?

40:35.959 --> 40:38.660
<i>- (Knock on door)
- (Sports game playing on TV)</i>

40:43.732 --> 40:45.766
(Hat thuds, door slams)

40:45.834 --> 40:48.669
(Breathing heavily) About time, cowboy.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.308
(Indistinct conversations)

40:53.375 --> 40:54.842
(Lowered voice) Looks
like his fans are finally

40:54.910 --> 40:56.344
starting to clear out a little bit.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.145
What should I say?

40:58.213 --> 41:00.748
Oh, honey. You can relax.

41:00.816 --> 41:02.683
- You've known Deacon your whole life.
- (Sighs)

41:02.751 --> 41:04.151
He always liked me, right?

41:04.219 --> 41:07.888
- He always loved you.
- Yeah.

41:07.956 --> 41:09.456
Oh, hey, thank you. Appreciate that.

41:09.524 --> 41:11.092
Sorry. I'm sorry. Can I join y'all?

41:11.159 --> 41:13.460
Please do.

41:13.528 --> 41:15.129
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:15.196 --> 41:16.530
You were great up there.

41:16.598 --> 41:17.931
Thank you. I was, uh...

41:17.999 --> 41:19.633
I was pretty scared up there,

41:19.700 --> 41:21.034
starting off.

41:21.102 --> 41:22.402
Um, I'm not comfortable, you know,

41:22.470 --> 41:24.204
singing without a guitar
in my hands, you know?

41:24.272 --> 41:26.072
Uh, I am the same way.

41:26.141 --> 41:28.342
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. I... I really am.

41:28.409 --> 41:31.911
(Giggles) Maybe I got it from you.

41:31.979 --> 41:34.247
Maybe so. Yeah.

41:34.314 --> 41:36.049
Sorry. (Laughs)

41:36.117 --> 41:37.917
You know, at least you
got your mama's good looks.

41:37.985 --> 41:39.686
All right. I'm gonna go get us

41:39.754 --> 41:41.220
another round of root beers.

41:41.288 --> 41:42.722
And some chicken fingers?

41:42.790 --> 41:44.624
All right. And some chicken fingers.

41:44.692 --> 41:45.759
Get some fingers.

41:45.826 --> 41:47.426
What happened to your glasses? You...

41:47.494 --> 41:49.395
No, yeah. I got contacts.

41:49.463 --> 41:53.332
- Oh, is that so?
- I think they make me look a little more grown-up.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.468
You're definitely growing up fast.

41:55.536 --> 41:58.137
Just not too fast, okay?

41:58.205 --> 41:59.938
I just got here.

42:01.608 --> 42:04.376
- So you, uh... you...
- (Continues indistinctly)

42:04.443 --> 42:09.048
(Deacon and Maddie speaking indistinctly)

42:09.115 --> 42:10.649
(Knock on door)

42:10.657 --> 42:12.391
It's about time!

42:12.458 --> 42:13.592
Surprise.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.060
Olivia, hey.

42:15.128 --> 42:16.562
I hope you don't mind me
just dropping by like this.

42:16.630 --> 42:19.498
No, no, no. Come in, please.

42:19.566 --> 42:22.100
Did you come for the show?

42:22.168 --> 42:25.170
(Door closes) Sadly, no. I got in too late.

42:25.238 --> 42:26.470
Oh. Bummer.

42:26.538 --> 42:28.705
Maybe we could spend the
day together tomorrow.

42:28.773 --> 42:30.774
I'm sure there's something
exciting to do here.

42:30.842 --> 42:33.744
Or some... one.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.648
Yes. I know you're
sleeping with my husband.

42:39.051 --> 42:42.319
But what I don't understand...

42:42.387 --> 42:43.720
is why you're not sleeping with me.
