01:18.010 --> 01:20.311
(humming happily)

01:20.379 --> 01:22.514
Excuse me.
                 (laughs)

01:22.581 --> 01:23.681
What do you say, guys?

01:23.749 --> 01:24.783
Well.
            Oh, my gosh.

01:24.851 --> 01:25.884
(laughs)
       How come you're so happy?

01:25.951 --> 01:27.018
Well...

01:27.086 --> 01:28.353
I didn't tell you
       about this before

01:28.420 --> 01:29.821
because if it didn't work out,

01:29.889 --> 01:31.489
it would have been real,
       real embarrassing,

01:31.557 --> 01:33.792
but I've got a chance
       to make big money.

01:33.859 --> 01:36.427
Wait a minute.
         What is it? What is it?

01:36.495 --> 01:38.229
Chinchillas.

01:38.297 --> 01:40.398
Chinchillas?
Eight months ago,

01:40.466 --> 01:41.499
I bought six of them.

01:41.566 --> 01:42.934
Guess how many I got now.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.402
Go ahead, take a guess. Go on!

01:44.470 --> 01:50.241
What an interesting question
        you pose, Tony.

01:50.309 --> 01:55.112
Considering
gestation period

01:55.180 --> 01:57.549
and average
litter size...

01:57.616 --> 02:00.018
about eight months...

02:00.085 --> 02:01.919
uh...

02:01.987 --> 02:04.889
you've got 162.

02:06.859 --> 02:09.060
No, I got 165, Jim!

02:09.127 --> 02:11.062
165!

02:11.130 --> 02:14.899
What was I thinking of?

02:16.669 --> 02:18.603
I feel about this big.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.606
Jim, you were off by three.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.542
Oh, go ahead, lady,
           rub it in.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.450
Anyway, uh, a chinchilla coat
     costs thousands of dollars,

02:32.518 --> 02:36.654
so I'm on easy street as soon as
those little guys start to shed.

02:36.722 --> 02:37.822
Watch out!

02:37.890 --> 02:39.857
Ooh!
                         Oh, no.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.259
Oh, no, no, no.
   Oh, Tony.

02:41.326 --> 02:43.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.897
(chortling)

02:45.965 --> 02:48.500
I hate to be the one
to break this to you, Banta,

02:48.568 --> 02:51.202
but they don't shed.

02:51.270 --> 02:54.205
Oh, what do you mean?
            You got to clip 'em?

02:54.273 --> 02:55.640
Uh-uh.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.177
If you want to make coats out of
the little babies, you got to...

02:59.245 --> 03:00.511
(makes slicing sound)

03:00.579 --> 03:02.514
(screaming)

03:04.884 --> 03:06.751
Oh, no!

03:06.819 --> 03:09.120
Oh, sorry, Tony.

03:09.187 --> 03:10.388
Well, I can't do it.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.990
I can't. I'm not gonna kill
little-little Chubby

03:13.058 --> 03:16.694
and Muffin and... Whiskers
and Boots and Iron Man

03:16.762 --> 03:18.729
and Rocky One, Rocky Two,
Rocky Three,

03:18.797 --> 03:19.864
and Toots and Joey

03:19.931 --> 03:21.099
and Groovy...
                  Wait a minute.

03:21.167 --> 03:24.001
Tony, Tony! You
              named all of them?

03:24.069 --> 03:26.270
I had to have something
to put on their bowls.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.744
Look what I got,
                      everybody.

03:37.249 --> 03:39.183
A monk.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.488
Isn't that something?

03:43.555 --> 03:46.290
You-You know the party
          you're all invited to,

03:46.358 --> 03:49.894
to come tonight to meet
           Simka's cousin Zifka.

03:49.961 --> 03:51.062
ALEX: Yeah.
                     TONY: Yeah?

03:51.130 --> 03:52.397
Well, this is him.

03:52.464 --> 03:53.565
Oh.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.333
This is some surprise, huh?

03:55.401 --> 03:56.601
Yeah.

03:56.669 --> 04:00.338
(chuckles):
Wow.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.909
When I was a reverend,
I used to wear a robe myself,

04:04.977 --> 04:07.545
but it didn't
look like that.

04:07.613 --> 04:09.814
What-What did
                   it look like?

04:09.882 --> 04:11.816
This.

04:13.819 --> 04:16.921
Well, anyway, I won't bother
     to introduce him now.

04:16.988 --> 04:18.890
I'll see you all at 8:00.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.591
Wait a minute, wait a
          minute, wait a minute.

04:20.659 --> 04:21.692
Why can't you
       introduce him now?

04:21.760 --> 04:24.529
He can't talk.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.198
He has taken a vow of
   non-communication.

04:27.265 --> 04:29.233
See?
                   Oh, oh...

04:29.301 --> 04:31.235
He can't even do this.

04:35.107 --> 04:36.207
And he can't
                 even do this.

04:36.274 --> 04:37.442
ALEX: Yeah, yeah.
                  We understand.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.609
You know,
                he can't even...

04:38.677 --> 04:40.244
No, no. We understand, yeah.

04:40.312 --> 04:41.946
Excuse me.

04:42.013 --> 04:45.350
I wanted to ask a question
   about this party tonight.

04:45.418 --> 04:49.154
Are we going
     to get wild or crazy?

04:49.221 --> 04:51.789
You know, talk?

04:51.857 --> 04:53.724
Sure.

04:53.792 --> 04:57.094
See, Zifka comes from a
         monastery in my country

04:57.162 --> 05:00.398
that has a religious order
          that is much different

05:00.466 --> 05:03.067
than any religious
        order you ever heard of.

05:03.135 --> 05:05.670
Every ten years, each
           monk in the monastery

05:05.738 --> 05:07.305
takes a week off,

05:07.373 --> 05:09.240
and during that week,
he is free

05:09.308 --> 05:11.409
to sample all
of life's pleasures.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.245
Zifka's week starts
                tonight at 8:00.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.846
So, see you all there.

05:15.914 --> 05:17.081
Bye-bye.

05:17.148 --> 05:19.316
Come on... come on.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.990
I admire that guy.

05:26.058 --> 05:29.127
Did you see the serenity
          in his eyes?

05:30.863 --> 05:33.832
It must be wonderful in there.

05:36.001 --> 05:39.537
I'm going to take
    a vow of silence myself.

05:41.073 --> 05:45.143
I, Jim Ignatowski,
      will no longer talk.

05:48.647 --> 05:49.914
Oh, that's easy.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.883
Oops.

05:55.788 --> 05:59.657
Everybody, it is 8:00.

05:59.725 --> 06:04.028
It's time
   for Zifka's week to begin!

06:04.095 --> 06:06.030
(zipping)
            Oh, gosh!

06:10.035 --> 06:15.039
Well, I wonder
   what sage words of wisdom

06:15.107 --> 06:19.610
he will impart
 after ten years of meditation.

06:19.678 --> 06:22.346
How do I look?

06:22.414 --> 06:24.248
You look wonderful.

06:24.316 --> 06:25.416
Oh.

06:25.484 --> 06:27.951
Zifka, we have
                 a gift for you.

06:28.019 --> 06:29.320
A watch.

06:29.388 --> 06:33.224
Oh, but I cannot keep it when
I go back to the monastery.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.259
That-That's the good part.

06:35.326 --> 06:37.762
Eh, we get it back
        when you leave.

06:40.799 --> 06:43.567
Oh. Thank you.

06:43.635 --> 06:44.802
Thank you.

06:44.869 --> 06:46.804
So, what are you
              going to do first?

06:48.573 --> 06:50.008
Slouch.

06:50.075 --> 06:54.111
At the monastery, they are
such sticklers for posture.

06:54.179 --> 06:55.313
(chuckles)

06:55.381 --> 06:57.648
(sighing):
Oh. Oh.

06:57.716 --> 07:00.652
Zifka, Zifka, please,
       stand up straight.

07:00.719 --> 07:02.587
We want you
      to meet our friends.

07:02.654 --> 07:03.788
That's right.

07:03.855 --> 07:05.857
Here, this is Louie.

07:05.924 --> 07:07.124
Louie!
How you doing?

07:07.192 --> 07:08.292
(grunts)

07:08.360 --> 07:09.360
And this is Alex.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.595
Alex!
                 Hi.

07:10.662 --> 07:11.762
Hi.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.231
And over here,
                   this is Tony.

07:13.298 --> 07:16.433
Oh, how ya doing?
       Tony.

07:16.501 --> 07:18.068
And this is Jim.

07:18.136 --> 07:20.070
Jim!

07:26.411 --> 07:30.915
I-I want to thank you for
  bringing silence into my life.

07:32.651 --> 07:35.553
And over here,
this-this is Elaine.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.288
Hello.

07:40.025 --> 07:41.592
Do you dance?

07:41.660 --> 07:43.628
Yes.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.162
I thought so.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.165
The man is a smoothie.

07:48.834 --> 07:51.336
That's what he loves
      more than anything.

07:51.403 --> 07:52.503
Dancing.

07:52.571 --> 07:54.572
Yes. Oh, my
                   good friends,

07:54.640 --> 07:56.674
I am so pleased to
                know all of you.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.844
I have so much to catch up on
       in so little time.

07:59.911 --> 08:04.615
Latka, do you know what I
    would really love to do now?

08:04.682 --> 08:06.416
Well, no, golly gee.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.986
I wonder,
what would you like to do now?

08:09.054 --> 08:11.322
I would love to listen

08:11.390 --> 08:15.859
to somebody really
        talented play the gruck.

08:15.927 --> 08:18.329
Oh, well, I wonder
where we could find someone

08:18.397 --> 08:19.763
who knows
how to play the gruck.

08:19.831 --> 08:23.801
Well, your cousin Zifka!

08:23.869 --> 08:26.404
SIMKA:
Oh, that's right!

08:26.472 --> 08:30.975
Well, maybe he needs just
a little bit of encouragement

08:31.042 --> 08:33.443
to play the gruck!

08:33.511 --> 08:35.446
ALL: Play the gruck!
Play the gruck!

08:35.514 --> 08:37.582
(all chanting):
Play the gruck!

08:37.649 --> 08:39.884
Okay, okay.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.453
He plays
    the eight-string gruck.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.022
He plays it so beautifully.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.491
He was a child prodigy.

08:47.559 --> 08:49.994
Did you know that
               at the age of 12,

08:50.062 --> 08:55.366
he was the second gruckist
       in the national symphony?

08:55.433 --> 08:57.769
There is a particular song, uh,

08:57.836 --> 09:00.238
from my country
   that I would like to sing.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.906
It, um...

09:01.974 --> 09:06.710
Tradition says that it may only
 be sung for a beautiful woman.

09:06.778 --> 09:07.978
(plays a chord)

09:08.046 --> 09:11.682
Uh, I think, Elaine, you
     fulfill those requirements.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.117
(chuckles)

09:13.185 --> 09:14.418
LOUIE:
                      I knew it.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.821
He's been staring
at your headlights all night.

09:19.658 --> 09:21.592
Headlights?

09:21.660 --> 09:25.396
Uh, "headlights" means,
    uh, eyes, Zifka-- eyes.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.265
Well, in that case,
      I dedicate this song

09:27.332 --> 09:30.301
to Elaine's headlights.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.073
(sighs)

09:37.442 --> 09:40.378
(singing in native language)

09:53.492 --> 09:55.426
(singing and playing continues)

10:16.614 --> 10:18.482
That was beautiful.

10:18.550 --> 10:22.987
Elaine, in the song, he has
asked you to go dancing with him

10:23.054 --> 10:24.989
in the village by moonlight.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.290
Aw.

10:29.294 --> 10:32.396
Hey, Zif, what you're
       really looking forward to

10:32.464 --> 10:33.631
is going dancing?

10:33.698 --> 10:34.899
Yes.
                        Come on.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.968
I'll take ya dancing.
        I know a place. Come on.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.736
Oh! Gee, I just forgot.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.837
I just remembered.
                I can't make it.

10:40.905 --> 10:42.439
Elaine, come
                  here a second.

10:42.507 --> 10:44.608
Oh, take it easy.

10:44.676 --> 10:47.278
Elaine, would you
      take Zifka dancing?

10:47.345 --> 10:50.048
Wink. Wink.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.248
Well, I don't...

10:51.316 --> 10:52.950
I-I'd love to,
          but, I mean,

10:53.018 --> 10:54.118
Simka, you have
      this party planned.

10:54.185 --> 10:56.153
Oh, no, no.
           Go ahead.

10:56.221 --> 10:59.356
All I prepared
was a bowl of bread.

10:59.424 --> 11:02.827
Well, here I am
      in the same old rut:

11:02.895 --> 11:05.462
going out dancing with a monk.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.164
She's only kidding.
             She's a good sport.

11:07.232 --> 11:08.598
Go ahead. Have fun, you two.

11:08.666 --> 11:09.734
(all saying goodbyes)

11:09.801 --> 11:11.068
Thank you.

11:11.136 --> 11:12.069
He's all right.

11:12.137 --> 11:13.671
He's all right.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.707
All right, turn out
      the lights. Party's over.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.776
Bye-bye, everybody!

11:18.844 --> 11:20.144
Come back again.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.312
Sure.

11:21.379 --> 11:24.048
Yeah.
   We'll be right back. Yeah.

11:28.186 --> 11:30.388
(laughing)
           Just a second, Zifka.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.889
I just have to get my keys.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.090
Oh, Elaine, I...

11:33.158 --> 11:34.758
Thank you for a wonderful
                evening tonight.

11:34.826 --> 11:35.993
Oh... (laughs)

11:36.061 --> 11:40.297
Oh, I really enjoyed
   those clubs and the music.

11:40.365 --> 11:43.067
You know, I just wish
    I'd gotten you to dance.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.070
Oh, do you think less of me
      because I couldn't?

11:46.137 --> 11:48.405
No, of course not.

11:48.473 --> 11:51.875
I always wanted to,
   but I-I never really have.

11:51.943 --> 11:55.813
So, there are all those people
        there, you know.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.748
It makes me nervous.

11:57.816 --> 11:59.450
So why didn't you just imagine

11:59.518 --> 12:01.352
that you were dancing
         alone with me?

12:01.419 --> 12:03.220
Ah, that's what I was doing

12:03.288 --> 12:05.590
the whole time
      I was sitting there.

12:05.657 --> 12:08.292
(chuckles)

12:08.359 --> 12:10.461
Oh, you're good.

12:10.528 --> 12:13.463
Oh, no, no.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.168
¶ Heaven...

12:17.236 --> 12:19.036
(laughs)

12:20.505 --> 12:22.473
¶ I'm in heaven ¶

12:22.541 --> 12:24.408
(laughs)

12:24.476 --> 12:30.181
¶ And my heart beats so
       that I can hardly speak ¶

12:30.249 --> 12:32.716
¶ Da-da-da da-da da-da da-da

12:32.784 --> 12:34.484
¶ Da-da da da...

12:34.552 --> 12:35.953
(chuckles)

12:36.020 --> 12:40.123
¶ Da-da da-da da-da
         da-da da-da ¶

12:42.494 --> 12:45.295
¶ Oh, I'd love to
        go out fishing ¶

12:45.363 --> 12:46.964
¶ In a river or a creek

12:47.032 --> 12:48.299
(phone rings)

12:48.366 --> 12:52.336
¶ But it doesn't thrill me
                  half as much ¶

12:52.404 --> 12:53.871
I'm busy.

13:02.313 --> 13:04.248
(laughing)

13:09.321 --> 13:11.622
¶ Heaven

13:11.689 --> 13:15.258
¶ I'm in heaven ¶

13:18.496 --> 13:23.768
¶ And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak... ¶

13:23.835 --> 13:26.003
(Elaine laughing)

13:26.071 --> 13:29.106
¶ And I seem to find

13:29.174 --> 13:33.144
¶ The happiness I seek...

13:33.212 --> 13:36.046
Oh, I always
              wanted to do that.

13:36.114 --> 13:39.116
¶ When we're out together ¶

13:39.184 --> 13:42.386
¶ Dancing cheek to cheek

13:43.488 --> 13:45.322
¶ Dance with me

13:45.390 --> 13:49.026
¶ I want my arms about you
           (laughing)

13:49.093 --> 13:52.362
¶ All the charms
about you ¶

13:56.901 --> 14:00.905
¶ When we're out together ¶

14:00.973 --> 14:04.708
¶ Dancing cheek to cheek.

14:04.776 --> 14:06.944
How long are you
                    in town for?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.945
(laughs)

14:19.357 --> 14:21.291
(laughter)

14:22.760 --> 14:23.828
Oh, hi.

14:23.895 --> 14:25.997
Oh. What did you guys
do today?

14:26.064 --> 14:27.231
Oh... oh!

14:27.299 --> 14:28.632
We went
to the Bronx Zoo.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.267
And to the World
Trade Center.

14:30.335 --> 14:32.169
And then...
then we flew a kite

14:32.236 --> 14:33.437
in Central Park,
                       you know,

14:33.505 --> 14:36.807
and then we went roller-skating
       down Fifth Avenue.

14:36.875 --> 14:40.177
Were you singing "I'm a
         Pepper, he's a Pepper"?

14:41.479 --> 14:43.714
So how'd you like the
    World Trade Center, Zifka?

14:43.782 --> 14:45.282
Oh, it... it was great.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.284
Mm-hmm.

14:46.351 --> 14:47.551
Well, listen, Elaine, uh,

14:47.619 --> 14:49.219
shall I meet you again
       same time tonight?

14:49.287 --> 14:50.253
Yes.

14:50.321 --> 14:51.822
Okay.
       (knocks on table)

14:51.890 --> 14:53.724
I'm going shopping.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.660
I'm going shopping
                to buy a present

14:56.728 --> 14:59.930
for a person, whose
             face like an angel,

14:59.997 --> 15:01.899
has made my
                      visit here

15:01.966 --> 15:04.134
a treasure never
                to be forgotten.

15:04.202 --> 15:05.369
Oh, I'm so flattered.

15:05.436 --> 15:09.439
Even hearing you say it
    just makes me go crazy.

15:09.507 --> 15:10.707
Oh, Alex.

15:10.775 --> 15:12.643
I-I'll be leaving New York
            tonight.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.245
I'm going back
    to the monastery, so...

15:15.313 --> 15:17.448
so I'll be...
   won't be seeing you again.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.183
So, I just wanted you to know

15:20.251 --> 15:23.287
I'll be praying for you to find
  a little bit more happiness.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.989
Oh, oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

15:25.056 --> 15:26.590
I'm just reading my newspaper.

15:26.658 --> 15:28.826
Well, it was really nice
          meeting you.

15:29.927 --> 15:30.928
Oh, good-bye.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.229
(smooching)

15:32.297 --> 15:33.330
(smooching)

15:33.397 --> 15:34.799
Come early.

15:34.866 --> 15:36.800
(laughing)

15:39.170 --> 15:41.739
He seems to be taking up
 a lot of your time, isn't he?

15:41.807 --> 15:42.939
Oh, yeah.

15:43.007 --> 15:44.441
Yeah, to tell you the truth,

15:44.509 --> 15:46.677
we're spending every chance
        we get together.

15:46.744 --> 15:49.146
Mm-hmm.
    He's so much fun, Alex.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.216
You know, he-he finds pleasure
         in everything.

15:52.283 --> 15:54.051
He... it's, like,

15:54.118 --> 15:56.787
all a brand-new experience
              for him because...

15:56.855 --> 15:58.889
because... because he thinks
      that way, you know,

15:58.957 --> 16:00.624
and-and he makes me feel
         that way, too.

16:00.692 --> 16:03.427
I mean, things I've seen
            and done all my life

16:03.495 --> 16:06.730
suddenly seem wonderful to me
  because he thinks they are.

16:06.797 --> 16:10.301
Oh, I'll tell you, this has been
   the best week of my life.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.270
Well, that's very nice
        for both of you.

16:13.338 --> 16:15.439
Is something wrong?

16:16.541 --> 16:18.008
Well, now that you mention it...

16:18.075 --> 16:20.077
I hope you don't take this
         the wrong way,

16:20.144 --> 16:22.580
but you are the worst parent
        I've ever seen.

16:22.647 --> 16:25.248
What?!
       You were spending
    so much time with Zifka,

16:25.316 --> 16:27.417
you forgot about your own son
    Jason's birthday party.

16:27.485 --> 16:28.419
Oh, no.

16:28.486 --> 16:29.920
Every year,
I come over and we go

16:29.988 --> 16:31.355
to Coney Island
or something like that?
                           Yeah.

16:31.422 --> 16:33.123
And I woke up this morning
and I remembered

16:33.191 --> 16:34.291
the birthday
was yesterday, and I...

16:34.358 --> 16:36.093
and those kids really must
have missed their party.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.528
Well, actually, Alex,
       we had the party.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.196
You see, and-and Zifka
      was there, and we...

16:40.264 --> 16:42.967
we were having such a good time
      that I forgot to call you.

16:43.034 --> 16:44.134
I'm sorry.

16:44.202 --> 16:46.537
Oh, that's all right.

16:46.604 --> 16:48.338
I was just concerned
that they have a good time.

16:48.406 --> 16:50.841
Oh, yeah.
                They like Zifka?

16:50.909 --> 16:52.076
They love him.

16:52.143 --> 16:53.877
Yeah. I can see how
                they'd like him.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.879
He's like a Smurf.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.848
(laughs)
Yeah.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.717
Alex...

17:00.785 --> 17:02.186
I love Zifka, too.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.320
(laughs)

17:04.422 --> 17:05.789
Why are you laughing?

17:05.857 --> 17:07.124
"I love Zifka."

17:07.192 --> 17:08.925
I mean, the sound of it.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.661
You can't possibly be serious.

17:10.729 --> 17:12.194
"I love Zifka"--
      that's like saying,

17:12.262 --> 17:13.997
"I love Bomba."

17:14.065 --> 17:15.933
"I love Cheetah."

17:16.000 --> 17:17.968
Doesn't he have a last name?

17:18.036 --> 17:19.803
What does his last name matter?

17:19.871 --> 17:21.939
I, uh... I'm telling you,

17:22.007 --> 17:24.474
this is the fullest relationship
        I've had in a long time.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.776
Fullest relationship?

17:25.844 --> 17:27.243
Oh, come on, Elaine.

17:27.311 --> 17:29.847
You may not have thought
of this, but...

17:29.915 --> 17:32.148
in a full relationship,

17:32.216 --> 17:36.186
physical compatibility
       is very important.

17:36.254 --> 17:37.321
So?

17:37.389 --> 17:41.258
So, he's been celibate
        for ten years.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.860
So?

17:42.928 --> 17:45.629
So...

17:45.696 --> 17:49.733
he may find it difficult
      to be with a woman.

17:49.801 --> 17:51.034
No problem.

17:51.102 --> 17:53.237
No problem.

17:53.304 --> 17:55.105
Well, that's a relief.

17:55.173 --> 17:57.174
Alex, Zifka's wonderful.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.744
He's... he's physical and
     spiritual at the same time.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.412
Please.
                          And...

18:02.480 --> 18:06.016
and you should see how shy he
      gets when I tell him that.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.184
You tell him those things?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.285
Yeah.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.486
Oh, Elaine...

18:09.553 --> 18:10.921
Elaine, this guy comes
     from another country.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.089
Don't you know that?

18:12.156 --> 18:14.258
I mean, he might...
    he might not understand

18:14.325 --> 18:15.659
that someone in New York...

18:15.727 --> 18:17.861
how they speak
    in New York, you know...

18:17.929 --> 18:20.797
people say things very easily
   and don't even mean them.

18:20.865 --> 18:22.632
Well, I don't say them easily,

18:22.700 --> 18:25.869
and I certainly mean
       every one of them.

18:25.936 --> 18:29.106
Alex, in the purest sense
          of the word,

18:29.174 --> 18:32.042
this has been the most
   romantic week of my life.

18:32.109 --> 18:34.845
Oh...
(blows raspberry)

18:34.913 --> 18:37.347
Well, obviously, the
             romance eludes you.

18:37.415 --> 18:38.682
Oh, wait a minute.
        Elaine, Elaine!

18:38.750 --> 18:40.551
You know, I was going
 to let you walk out that door

18:40.619 --> 18:43.453
without saying my piece,
but you keep heaping it on.

18:43.521 --> 18:45.088
But at the point
that I realize

18:45.156 --> 18:46.690
that you're toying
with this guy,

18:46.757 --> 18:48.225
then somebody
has to stop you.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.228
Don't tell me I
                 toyed with him.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.497
I don't toy with monks.

18:53.565 --> 18:56.099
You know, that's a terrible
      thing to say to somebody--

18:56.167 --> 18:57.101
that they toyed
                    with a monk.

18:57.168 --> 18:58.302
Yeah, all-all right.
Look, I'm sorry.

18:58.369 --> 18:59.503
I'm sorry. I...

18:59.571 --> 19:00.737
All right,
maybe I'm wrong.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.940
Elaine, now, come on.
Don't be mad at me!

19:04.042 --> 19:05.909
Ah...

19:09.013 --> 19:10.713
(sighs)

19:11.816 --> 19:13.717
I'm not mad at you.

19:15.186 --> 19:16.954
(sighs)

19:17.021 --> 19:18.421
How could I be mad at you?

19:18.489 --> 19:19.523
(grunts)

19:19.591 --> 19:20.590
You're just jealous

19:20.658 --> 19:22.425
that you have no
              love in your life.

19:37.074 --> 19:38.942
(knock at door)

19:39.010 --> 19:40.977
Oh!

19:41.045 --> 19:42.245
Where have you been?

19:42.313 --> 19:43.480
Our last night together.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.481
Time is almost up.

19:44.548 --> 19:45.716
I can't believe it.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.485
I made you vegetarian
         lasagna and everything.

19:48.553 --> 19:50.186
Elaine, I got lost.

19:50.254 --> 19:52.623
I took the wrong subway.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.525
We only have a minute,
40 seconds left

19:55.593 --> 19:57.828
before I have
to be silent again.

19:57.895 --> 19:59.529
Oh, there's
so much to do.

19:59.597 --> 20:01.665
I-I-I don't know
what to do first.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.500
Kiss me.

20:05.403 --> 20:07.571
Now, eat some lasagna.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.373
(sighs)

20:10.441 --> 20:11.375
Mmm.
                      It's good?

20:11.442 --> 20:12.375
Mmm!

20:14.512 --> 20:15.912
Isn't life crazy,
Elaine?

20:15.980 --> 20:18.482
You know, one minute,

20:18.550 --> 20:21.518
you're in New York
kissing a beautiful girl,

20:21.586 --> 20:23.019
and then the next,

20:23.087 --> 20:26.023
back at the abbey
rolling cheese balls.

20:27.425 --> 20:29.559
Oh, it's so frustrating.

20:29.627 --> 20:32.296
Elaine, I was looking forward
     to this entire evening

20:32.364 --> 20:34.898
to tell you
    of my feelings for you.

20:34.966 --> 20:36.399
Uh... there's
so much to say.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.668
I don't know how
I can say it all now.
                            Shh.

20:38.736 --> 20:40.237
You don't have
                to say anything.
No!

20:40.304 --> 20:41.871
No, I do.
Elaine, you...

20:41.939 --> 20:45.309
you don't know how important
         this is to me.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.410
You know, it's not very often

20:47.478 --> 20:50.347
(watch alarm beeping)
that it happens that... when...

20:56.554 --> 20:58.188
Oh, no.

20:59.590 --> 21:02.659
No, no, no.

21:05.996 --> 21:08.098
(sighs)

21:14.005 --> 21:16.072
Can you at least
                   stick around?

21:16.140 --> 21:19.008
Lots of couples don't
             talk to each other.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.012
I'm sorry.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.115
I'm sorry; I didn't
         mean to make you smile.

21:29.086 --> 21:31.488
This is so frustrating!

21:35.760 --> 21:38.094
Zifka, you're great.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.765
(sighs)

21:41.833 --> 21:43.667
And don't... don't worry

21:43.734 --> 21:45.869
about not being able
to tell me anything.

21:47.271 --> 21:49.740
What we had was so special.

21:52.977 --> 21:54.744
(sighs)

21:54.812 --> 21:57.714
Well, there's no easy way
        to do this, huh?

22:09.160 --> 22:11.328
So, here's to us.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.211
Bye, Zifka.

22:36.488 --> 22:40.324
(piano gently playing
       "Cheek to Cheek")

23:04.848 --> 23:05.782
(song ends)

23:16.026 --> 23:19.663
(theme song playing)

23:40.518 --> 23:42.219
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:42.286 --> 23:43.386
(man grumbling)

23:44.305 --> 23:50.199
