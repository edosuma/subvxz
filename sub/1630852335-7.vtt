Were you a restauranteur before

[peter] before this, I was a

And then you decided to make
sauces?

03:10.457 --> 03:12.891
-[michele] no way!
-Then I sold meat.

-But I don't eat meat anymore.
-Okay.

was I got very sick eating meat,

03:18.898 --> 03:20.599

products.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.468

funny about our product is

vegan or vegetarian...

03:34.881 --> 03:35.847

03:37.350 --> 03:38.750

09:10.283 --> 09:12.117
I'm the co-founder of trureal.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.419

-Okay.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.023
[horace] let me ask you

09:19.026 --> 09:22.193
If you're able to give to
charity and never take

09:22.261 --> 09:23.828
An additional dollar out of your
pocket, would you give?

09:26.799 --> 09:27.665
Sure.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.666
[horace] I'm glad to hear that,
arlene.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.868
[michele] yeah.

09:29.936 --> 09:36.608
Imagine any time you go shopping
anywhere, you get cash back

09:36.676 --> 09:40.478
That you can give to your
favourite charity without

09:40.546 --> 09:41.479
Ever thinking about it.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.883
Trureal is a for-profit company
that's disrupting

09:45.886 --> 09:48.553
The fundraising
and loyalty space.

09:49.489 --> 09:54.258
We allow you to link any payment
method to any registered charity

09:54.327 --> 09:58.663
In canada, choose to keep the
cash back for yourself

09:58.731 --> 10:01.433
Or voluntarily donate 100% of it
to the charity of your choice.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.102
Just simply link and give.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.372
The timing is now.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.506
Trureal is now.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.844
-Thank you.
-Is there an app or a...

10:14.380 --> 10:16.414
-[michele] is there a demo?
-[manjit] demo?

10:16.482 --> 10:17.715
-No need to have a demo.
-[manjit] yeah.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.783
We are everywhere.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.053
-You just don't see us.
-[manjit] I'm confused.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.921
What are we investing in?

10:23.990 --> 10:26.224
You're investing in the
opportunity to do good.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.860
Trureal leverages everyday
purchases--

10:28.928 --> 10:30.395
Yeah, but what's the business?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.698
[horace] the business is we are
a third-party fundraising

10:33.766 --> 10:35.600
Company for registered charities
and nonprofits.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.773
We're linked to 9,600 banks in
north america.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.074
Horace, let me ask you a
question in terms of numbers.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.008
[horace] sure.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.743
...Because it's a pretty rich
valuation.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.878
[arlene] $18 million.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.080
[manjit] 18 million dollars,
yeah, that's pretty rich!

10:49.149 --> 10:50.348
[wes] so, tell me a little bit
about the numbers.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.217
How much revenue have you made
so far?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.519
And what kind of profits have
you kicked off?

10:55.154 --> 10:59.157
So trureal's been around since
2015 on our different prototype

10:59.159 --> 11:01.959
Where we were issuing pre-paid
cards, before we discovered

11:02.028 --> 11:05.496
The ability to link cards and
pivoted the business.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.898
We still consider ourselves
pre-revenue.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.968
We've generated about $42,000 in
the last couple of years.

11:11.037 --> 11:16.174
-[laughs] are you for real?
-I am, manjit.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.610
When we started,
we had bins where we were

11:18.678 --> 11:19.577
Issuing pre-paid cards.

11:19.645 --> 11:20.978
A very slow process.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.783
Today, we've completely
democratized consumer choice.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.485
[arlene] oh my god, what,
$18 million.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.687
What are you going to do with my
$900,000?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.222
If I gave it to you tomorrow,
what are you gonna do with it?

11:31.290 --> 11:32.657
Right.

11:32.725 --> 11:35.526
We're actually commercializing
our business.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.961
And I'll come back to your
question in a moment.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.598
Commercializing or starting the
business?

11:40.666 --> 11:43.735
No, manjit, let me just respond
to arlene just for a moment,

11:43.803 --> 11:45.002
And I'll come back to you,
respectfully.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.738
But, horace, you really should
respond to me first, right,

11:46.806 --> 11:49.407
Because I asked a question with
respect--

11:49.409 --> 11:51.142
We've raised about $42,000 so
far.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.579
That is not what's going to woo
you.

11:54.647 --> 11:58.883
However, for the first time in
history,

11:58.951 --> 12:02.320
A platform exists that puts all
of the control in the hands

12:02.388 --> 12:04.022
Of the consumer.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.156
-That is not true!
-[horace] let me finish.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.558
[arlene] there's lots of
platforms where I can decide

12:06.626 --> 12:07.759
Where I wanna send my charity
dollars.

12:07.827 --> 12:08.893
[michele] yeah!

12:08.962 --> 12:09.627
You've never seen what we're
doing before, so let me--

12:09.695 --> 12:10.828
[arlene] no, I still haven't.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.963
[manjit] still don't understand
it.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.731
[michele] let me try your pitch
for you.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.701
Any card that I have in my
wallet right now I can link

12:16.703 --> 12:18.102
To you.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.504
-You can see what I spend.
-[horace] yes.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.571
If I get the cash back,
I can choose to take

12:20.640 --> 12:22.039
That cash back myself or put
it to the charity.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.007
That's correct.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.043
The problem with that pitch is
it exists.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.213
[vincenzo] can you just start by
telling me...

12:29.216 --> 12:31.048
-[horace] yes.
-...How I'm gonna make money.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.683
-Start with that.
-[horace] absolutely.

12:32.686 --> 12:33.751
So why don't we do that,
vincenzo.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.486
There are four streams of
revenue for trureal.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.721
[vincenzo] right.

12:36.790 --> 12:40.825
[horace] a, we actually get 25
basis points for every cash back

12:40.893 --> 12:43.728
That the merchant contributes to
the program.

12:43.797 --> 12:48.633
So let's say guzzo cinemas was a
participating merchant offer

12:48.701 --> 12:50.501
In the trureal loyalty program,
no differently than you would

12:50.570 --> 12:51.435
Offer air miles.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.637
[manjit] mm hmm.

12:52.705 --> 12:56.207
You might commit 2% to the
program, of which 1.5% you're

12:56.275 --> 12:58.743
Actually giving as a cash back
to the consumer.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.212
They can choose to keep it or
voluntarily donate

13:01.214 --> 13:03.247
To the charity of their choice.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.518
Secondly, we have an online app
called trushop.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.488
We get a commission for driving
all that traffic.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.923
Here's a third revenue:

13:11.991 --> 13:14.892
This is the first company on the
planet...

13:14.961 --> 13:16.194
[manjit chuckles]

13:16.262 --> 13:17.162
[horace] I'm being bold, manjit.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.429
Yeah.

13:18.497 --> 13:21.899
...That can direct bank-funded
cashback and rewards to any

13:21.968 --> 13:23.568
Charity of your choice on our
platform.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.669
That's not true.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.503
[michele] that's actually just
not true.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.771
[arlene] it's not true.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.841
Like, I'm actually having a
really hard times with your

13:29.909 --> 13:32.009
Claims, because like ebates
exist.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.177
Like, you can move that money to
charity as well.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.245
[horace] michele--

13:34.314 --> 13:35.847
You're actually not
understanding the market.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.049
Michele, please allow me to
explain what I mean by that.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.350
[manjit sighs]

13:39.352 --> 13:39.951
[vincenzo] all right, so you
haven't even finished answering

13:40.019 --> 13:40.785
My question so--

13:40.787 --> 13:41.886
[horace] let me do this.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.955
-The fourth revenue stream...
-Oh, and then four?

13:43.957 --> 13:49.127
...Is the fact that we aggregate
massive end-to-end rich data.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.929
I also capture all their
personal--

13:51.998 --> 13:53.431
[arlene] actually, you don't
capture anything.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.732
You don't do anything.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.267
You don't have anything.

13:56.269 --> 14:00.371
You can't come here and say give
me close to a million dollars

14:00.440 --> 14:01.505
Of my money...

14:01.574 --> 14:02.873
[horace] yes.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.909
...To invest in an idea that you
haven't even started it, like--

14:04.977 --> 14:08.279
Well, I'm really sorry you feel
that way, arlene,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.381
Because the business
has started.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.618
We've brought in well over
$4 million in cash into

14:13.686 --> 14:15.186
This company, from friends and
family.

14:15.254 --> 14:18.289
[arlene] but what a company is
worth isn't what it's gonna take

14:18.291 --> 14:19.490
To build it.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.659
-Like, there--
-[wes] bro, listen to me.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.794
Here's how it works in the den,
as you'll see, right?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.997
There's a lot of people throwing
things at ya, right?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.366
The problem that you have and
the reason why everyone is

14:28.434 --> 14:32.436
Jumping down on you, right, a,
we don't see the product, right?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.271
That's the first thing.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.939
That's a big mistake.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.576
Secondly, you don't have any
sales, right?

14:38.644 --> 14:42.714
Third is that your valuation is
like--dude,

14:43.983 --> 14:45.850
The valuation is
the problem, right?

14:45.919 --> 14:49.721
Like, it's like--you know, you
want $18 million valuation.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.756
Sure.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.661
I care deeply about charity,
okay?

14:56.729 --> 14:57.895
Absolutely.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.830
So, this is not my issue with
what you're talking about.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.232
[horace] mm hmm.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.935
[arlene] and all I hear in this
story is a lot of the right

15:04.003 --> 15:06.704
Platitudes around charity and a
lot of the right comments around

15:06.772 --> 15:09.173
Making the world better,
but I hear greed.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.344
-And when I hear greed...
-[horace] mm hmm.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.145
...Against a charitable
effort...

15:14.213 --> 15:15.279
-[horace] mm hmm.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.415
...It turns me completely off.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.282
It's not for me.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.484
I'm gonna be out.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.218
You know, what's
interesting--

15:21.287 --> 15:22.687
-[vincenzo] horace, horace--
-what's interesting--

15:22.755 --> 15:23.955
Horace, I need the facts.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.023
What did you do with the
$4 million you raised?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.492
Well, that money's all been used
up because we had to build

15:28.495 --> 15:29.493
The platform.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.663
-[manjit chuckles]
-[michele] oh my goodness.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.197
[horace] now we've pivoted to be
card-linked.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.900
So the $4 million was wasted
because somebody innovated

15:35.968 --> 15:37.035
And now you're pivoting?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.469
Well, I wouldn't quite call it
wasted.

15:38.537 --> 15:39.570
What we've learned from--

15:39.639 --> 15:42.039
[manjit] horace, you say a lot
of buzz words,

15:42.108 --> 15:43.674
A lot of outrageous
bogus claims.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.742
I'm out.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.715
Truth of the matter is you're
trying to take us for a ride.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.116
Mm hmm.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.118
[vincenzo] you have no more
$4 million.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.988
And you have nothing to show for
it because it's now pivoted.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.691
So you'll understand why I'm
out, right?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.728
-Understood.
-[vincenzo] thank you, I'm out.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.863
[michele] I'm gonna kinda wrap
this up pretty quick here.

16:05.865 --> 16:10.634
So, it was an unclear pitch, it
was an undifferentiated product,

16:10.703 --> 16:12.670
And you weren't very capital
efficient, so for those reasons,

16:12.672 --> 16:13.771
I'm gonna be out.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.410
[wes] horace, seriously,
here's the thing:

16:19.412 --> 16:21.145
I know you've spent a lot of
money and you got money from

16:21.214 --> 16:23.381
People, but once you start to
get professional money...

16:23.449 --> 16:24.515
Mm hmm.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.450
[wes]...These are the
conversations you're gonna

16:26.519 --> 16:27.418
Be having with people.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.953
-Sure.
-They're gonna grill you.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.089
And last year, I started the
black north initiative, right

16:32.092 --> 16:36.160
And there's a lot of crazy stats
about how underfunded

16:36.228 --> 16:38.329
Black charities are in canada.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.298
If you came in front of me, and
you said, "listen, I'm trying to

16:40.366 --> 16:42.867
Solve that problem for you,"

18:34.880 --> 18:38.616

18:38.618 --> 18:42.019

18:50.496 --> 18:51.362
[michele] it's the most
important thing,

18:51.430 --> 18:52.229
Is dancing in them.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.564
And then you can balance.

-You can stretch in them.

[arlene] yeah?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.921
Okay, it doesn't feel like I've

19:16.989 --> 19:20.491
[dianne] dr. Liza's line of
posture shoes range from casual

19:20.493 --> 19:24.328
Slippers and sneakers to
high-heeled pumps and boots.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.664
You gotta strut.

[dianne] her shoes are designed
with the same type of platform

19:28.401 --> 19:31.602
Found in running shoes, and she
says they minimize joint impact

19:31.671 --> 19:34.605
By balancing the body.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.674
[manjit] well, they don't look

They're not a stiletto, but
yeah, they're comfortable.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.946
[michele] it's not a stiletto.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.548
[arlene] and I think it's fine
that they're not meant

19:44.551 --> 19:45.883
To replace this.

19:45.885 --> 19:49.353
I mean, they're meant to wear
like in an office or, you know,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.355
They're not evening shoes,
right?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.591
You can wear them as evening
shoes, but generally they are

19:53.659 --> 19:54.926
Made as a workhorse shoe, right?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.227
-[arlene] yeah.
-I like that.

19:56.229 --> 20:00.264
-Workhorse shoe, I like that.
-And that's what they do.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.266
[manjit] talk to us about the
unit economics.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.901
How much does it cost you to
make them?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.303
How much do you retail them,
on average?

20:06.772 --> 20:09.006
[dr. Liza] so the landed cost,
they range from about $60

20:09.008 --> 20:11.508
To all the way to $130
for the booties.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.943
Wow.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.346
[dr. Liza] but they retail from
$225 to $595.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.583
And the $595 booties are our
best-seller.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.118
-That's this one?
-[dr. Liza] yes.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.286
That's high though.

20:22.288 --> 20:25.489
There's a lot of a-listers out
there who love them.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.723
Kate winslet loves those pumps,
so.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.792
[arlene] tell us about them,
like how many have you sold

20:27.860 --> 20:29.093
And to who and--

20:29.161 --> 20:31.529
So so far, in total since
launching,

20:31.597 --> 20:33.998
We sold about half a million
in the shoes.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.633
And sorry, it's half a million
dollars last year?

20:35.701 --> 20:38.569
Okay, so the last 12 months,
we did $230,000.

20:38.637 --> 20:42.606
Currently that's all sold
through our e-commerce website.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.041
What's your return rate right
now online?

20:44.043 --> 20:46.944
So right now, as far as returns
for people getting refunds,

20:46.946 --> 20:48.779
It's only 4%.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.014
Oh, that's low.

20:50.016 --> 20:54.418
So people will exchange,
but we don't really--you know,

20:54.420 --> 20:55.286
They just want another size.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.620
They want the right fit.

20:56.623 --> 21:02.726
-And 4% for shoes is amazing.
-Unbelievable.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.662
This is all, you know, a setup
to get into the retailers,

21:04.730 --> 21:09.033
Because once we get into even
just one national retailer

21:09.101 --> 21:10.167
In canada and the u.S.--

21:10.236 --> 21:11.368
But getting into retail isn't
gonna be like magic.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.904
It's not all of a sudden just
gonna fly off the shelves.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.640
Yes, and that's one of the
reasons why it's great

21:16.008 --> 21:18.242
That I myself,
I'm a posture expert.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.777
-Completely agree.
-[dr. Liza] yes.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.045
Your endorsement means
something.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.549
However, it's still a massive
uphill battle here, not only

21:25.617 --> 21:27.918
With the marketing but with the
competition that you face.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.253
Absolutely, there is
competition,

21:29.322 --> 21:33.557
But this is unique in that this
is the only brand of dress shoes

21:33.625 --> 21:34.658
That is clinically tested.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.826
The only one.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.661
So I guess there's some science
behind--

21:37.730 --> 21:39.997
[dr. Liza] it's all
based on science.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.499

You can touch, you can feel,

22:20.572 --> 22:22.740
And then once we get enough
traction,

22:22.808 --> 22:25.576
Then we would be able to get a
distributor in the u.S.,

22:25.644 --> 22:28.312

...And you have sold $10,000
worth.
