WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:04.045
- PREVIOUSLY ON
<i>HOT IN CLEVELAND...</i>

00:04.129 --> 00:05.422
- WHAT THE HELL
IS ALL THIS STUFF?

00:05.505 --> 00:08.258
- YOU HAD TO DATE
A COP, DIDN'T YOU?

00:10.677 --> 00:13.471
I'M IN
FRICKIN' JAIL!

00:13.555 --> 00:14.931
- ELKA, I'M
GONNA BE BLUNT.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.808
THE STATE HAS A VERY
SOLID CASE AGAINST YOU.

00:16.891 --> 00:19.102
- SO YOU WANT ME TO
PRETEND TO BE SENILE?

00:19.185 --> 00:21.146
- THIS IS A HEARING TO
DETERMINE IF THE DEFENDANT

00:21.229 --> 00:23.064
IS COMPETENT
TO STAND TRIAL.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.774
FOR THE DEFENSE,
WE HAVE

00:24.858 --> 00:27.944
THE VERY
CAPABLE KIRK STARK.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.113
GOOD AFTERNOON, COUNSELOR.
- GOOD AFTERNOON, JUDGE.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.908
- IT IS NOW.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.412
- IF I GET AN ALL-FEMALE JURY,
I'VE GOT IT MADE.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.663
all: [laughing]

00:40.498 --> 00:42.333
- IN A SITUATION COMEDY
THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE,

00:42.417 --> 00:44.544
BUT EQUALLY
IMPORTANT STORIES.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.296
THE "A" STORY, WHICH IS ABOUT

00:46.379 --> 00:47.797
THE COMIC ADVENTURES
OF CHARACTERS.

00:47.881 --> 00:52.969
AND THE "B" STORY, WHICH IS THE
SAME THING, BUT SHORTER.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.804
THESE ARE
THOSE STORIES.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.104
- ELKA, HOW YOU DOING?
YOU NERVOUS?

01:03.188 --> 01:06.775
- I'M TOO SCREWED
TO BE NERVOUS.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.985
- OH, NOW,
COME ON.

01:09.068 --> 01:09.986
LET'S JUST
BE POSITIVE.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.488
- HOW?

01:11.571 --> 01:13.948
THEY CAUGHT ME RED-HANDED
WITH STOLEN MAFIA LOOT.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.366
- TRUE.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.286
BUT YOUR LAWYER IS
IRRESISTIBLE TO WOMEN,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.955
AND WE HAVE
SIX FEMALE JURORS.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.040
[slams down gavel]

01:22.123 --> 01:23.500
- OKAY, PEOPLE.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.502
WE CONTINUE WITH
CASE NUMBER 10421.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.837
<i>THE PEOPLE VS.</i>
<i>ELKA OSTROVSKY.</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:31.216
- AND WE KNOW JUDGE LESSER
HAS THE HOTS FOR YOUR LAWYER.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.219
- EVERYBODY HAVE
A GOOD WEEKEND?

01:34.302 --> 01:37.138
KIRK?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.681
[gasping]

01:38.765 --> 01:40.350
OH, NO.

01:40.433 --> 01:44.479
WHAT DID YOU DO TO
THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE?

01:44.562 --> 01:49.984
- I TOLD HIM, SOFTBALL
IS AN UGLY MAN'S SPORT.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.529
- I WAS EXPECTING A BUNT.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

01:52.612 --> 01:56.574
NOBODY BUNTS
IN SOFTBALL.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.035
THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.412
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
GOING TO YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.209
I MEAN, AS
SO MANY MEN DO...

02:06.292 --> 02:07.627
AFTER CHURCH...

02:07.710 --> 02:11.548
ON SUNDAYS.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.424
- MAY I SEE YOU
IN CHAMBERS?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.509
CYNTHIA?

02:14.592 --> 02:16.010
- IT'S "YOUR HONOR."

02:16.094 --> 02:19.055
AND NO, YOU MAY NOT.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.224
I'M GONNA NEED A MINUTE
TO PROCESS ALL THIS.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.310
SO SIT YOUR LYING,
HIDEOUS FACE DOWN!

02:38.533 --> 02:40.118
{\an8}- IT'S ALL OVER.
- NO, MAYBE NOT.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.162
{\an8}CHECK OUT
JUROR NUMBER EIGHT.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.293
{\an8}- OH, SURE.
THE NERD.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.087
{\an8}- HAVEN'T YOU SEEN HIM
LOOKING AT YOU?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.339
{\an8}- I HAVE HAD THE FEELING
THAT SOMEONE WAS

02:53.423 --> 02:55.758
{\an8}MENTALLY UNDRESSING ME.

02:55.842 --> 03:00.346
{\an8}BUT FOR ME
THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.724
{\an8}- WELL, TRUST ME.
IT'S HIM.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.143
{\an8}SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FLIRT,

03:05.226 --> 03:06.394
{\an8}AND MAYBE HE'LL
FEEL SORRY FOR YOU

03:06.477 --> 03:09.022
{\an8}AND VOTE
TO ACQUIT.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.107
{\an8}- IT WORKS WITH
SPEEDING TICKETS.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.567
{\an8}- REALLY?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.777
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
BEEN PULLED OVER.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.614
{\an8}- BECAUSE GIRLS LIKE YOU
DON'T SPEED, DEAR.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.492
{\an8}BUT GIRLS LIKE ME DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ELSE.

03:21.576 --> 03:26.623
{\an8}- WELL, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TURN ONE JUROR.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.251
{\an8}- DONE,
AND DONE.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.421
{\an8}BUTTERSCOTCH,
DO YOUR STUFF.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.474
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.976
{\an8}I'VE MOVED ON.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.353
{\an8}BUT I AM IN
NO MOOD TO PLAY,

03:48.436 --> 03:50.146
{\an8}SO NOBODY BETTER
WASTE MY TIME.

03:50.229 --> 03:53.107
{\an8}THE CASE OF
<i>PEOPLE VS. ELKA OSTROVSKY</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:55.193
{\an8}IS NOW
IN SESSION.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.213
- THERE.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.880
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

04:16.964 --> 04:19.300
- YOU ARE AMAZING.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.719
- I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING
TO YOUR REFLECTION.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.887
BUT I'LL TAKE
THE COMPLIMENT.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.306
- NOW, WHERE ARE
MY SMART GLASSES?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.225
- THE ONES WITHOUT THE LENSES?
- YES.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.018
- GETTING AN INTERVIEW
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE

04:29.102 --> 04:30.019
WAS QUITE A
COUP FOR ME.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.980
AND I WANT TO LOOK LIKE
A SERIOUS JOURNALIST.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.065
- WELL, I DON'T THINK SHE'S
GONNA BE THAT CHALLENGING.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.235
SHE SEEMS A LITTLE
BLONDE TO ME.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.403
- YEAH, I SEE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:38.486 --> 04:42.699
- HIGHLIGHTS ON,
BUT NOBODY'S HOME.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.492
- I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN
GET ANY NEWS ABOUT ELKA'S TRIAL.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.910
- HMM.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.037
- AH, VICTORIA CHASE.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.415
HEATHER SHAW.
- OH, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.833
I'M A BIG FAN
OF YOUR HUSBAND'S.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.835
AND YOU MAKE SUCH
A HANDSOME COUPLE.

04:53.918 --> 04:54.961
- OKAY, LOOK VICKY.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.379
WE CAN DO
THIS TWO WAYS.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.089
WE CAN KEEP UP
THE GOO-GA-GA,

04:58.172 --> 04:59.716
AND COAST LIKE
MERRY IDIOTS,

04:59.799 --> 05:01.384
OR WE CAN GROW A PAIR
AND ADMIT IT.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.844
WE'RE BOTH IN THIS
TO MANIPULATE

05:02.927 --> 05:05.179
THE POOR SAPS
WE CALL, "THE PEOPLE."

05:05.263 --> 05:08.141
- GO ON.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.392
- AMERICA MIGHT
NOT KNOW

05:09.475 --> 05:11.728
ABOUT THE FIRST FAMILY
OF OHIO NOW.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.563
BUT IF I GOT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT, THEY WILL.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.564
- WOW.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.816
YOU JUST WANNA
BE FAMOUS.

05:16.899 --> 05:21.112
DEAR GOD, I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND POLITICS.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.739
- WELL, WE'VE GOT
A LONG WAYS TO GO.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.907
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE COMPLETELY
UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OHIO.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.367
EVEN RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO THAT

05:26.451 --> 05:29.245
BLEEDING ABSCESS
PEOPLE CALL INDIANA.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.205
BUT WHILE CHARLES
IS ONLY GOVERNOR NOW--

05:31.289 --> 05:32.874
- WHO KNOWS WHERE
HE COULD END UP.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.375
IF YOU PLAY
HIS CARDS RIGHT.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.835
I MEAN, LOOK
AT SARAH PALIN.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.754
- NOW THAT WOMAN
KNOWS MARKETING.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.089
FAT CHANCE GETTING MY NITWIT
OF A TEENAGE DAUGHTER ON

05:40.173 --> 05:42.592
<i>DANCING WITH THE STARS.</i>

05:42.675 --> 05:44.886
- WELL, MAYBE IF
SHE GETS PREGNANT.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.430
- MM, KNOCK WOOD.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.267
- YOU KNOW, I AM NOT WITHOUT
AMBITION IN MY FIELD, EITHER.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.602
JUST YESTERDAY,
SOMEONE TOLD ME

05:52.685 --> 05:55.063
THAT I HAD THE LEGS
FOR FOX NEWS.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.397
- WELL THAT'S ONE OF
THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS

05:56.481 --> 05:58.566
YOU CAN GET
IN JOURNALISM.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.901
- THANK YOU.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.278
- SO LET'S USE EACH OTHER
TO GET TO THE TOP.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.947
- IN HOLLYWOOD,
WE CALL THAT FRIENDSHIP.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.951
SO WE ARE CAMPAIGNING
AGAINST ILLITERACY, RIGHT?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.578
- OR CHILDHOOD OBESITY.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.288
I'M WAITING TO SEE
WHICH ONE POLLS BETTER.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.623
IN FACT, I'M WAITING FOR
THE NUMBERS TO GET IN.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.791
LET ME SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.503
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:18.586 --> 06:20.755
- I JUST GOT A BUNCH
OF TEXTS FROM MEL.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.298
"ELKA'S ABOUT TO
TAKE THE STAND."

06:22.381 --> 06:24.175
"I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TEXT IN COURT."

06:24.258 --> 06:27.637
"HERE COMES THE BAILIFF,
HE'S TAKING MY CELL PH--"

06:27.720 --> 06:28.763
THAT'S THE END OF
THE TRANSMISSION.

06:28.846 --> 06:29.764
- OH, DAMN.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.140
WELL, THIS STORY
BETTER BE GOOD

06:31.224 --> 06:33.309
IF IT'S MAKING US
MISS ALL OF THAT.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.685
- THE POLL IS IN.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.105
IT'S CHILDHOOD OBESITY
OVER ILLITERACY.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.816
THEY PROBABLY COULDN'T
READ THE POLL QUESTION.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.819
TELL THE DUMB KID TO GO HOME
AND SEND IN THE FATTY.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.654
HEY, I KNOW YOU.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.656
YOU'RE JOY SCROGGS,
THE EYEBROW QUEEN.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.658
YOU DID
OPRAH'S ARCH.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.159
- I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY,
BUT TRUST ME,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.285
IF I WERE AT
LIBERTY TO SAY,

06:51.369 --> 06:52.495
MY ANSWER WOULD
CERTAINLY NOT BE,

06:52.578 --> 06:54.122
"I'M NOT AT
LIBERTY TO SAY."

06:54.205 --> 06:56.833
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU EVADE.
IT'S NICE, IT'S SEXY.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.835
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO MY HUSBAND'S BROWS?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.379
OR SHOULD I
SAY BROW?

07:01.462 --> 07:02.630
- OH, TRAGEDY.
- MM-HMM.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.341
WALKING HAIR BALL.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.343
- WELL, IT'S VERY MANLY.
- MM-HMM.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.678
- OH, LET'S NOT
SUGARCOAT IT.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.888
WE'RE NOT GETTING
WITHIN 50 MILES OF D.C.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.684
WITH THESE DANDRUFF-CATCHERS
ON HIS FOREHEAD.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.894
SO IF YOU'D BE WILLING
TO TRIM BACK THESE HEDGES

07:16.978 --> 07:19.522
YOU CAN
NAME YOUR PRICE.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.690
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
INSTEAD OF MONEY

07:20.773 --> 07:22.150
I COULD USE
SOME HELP.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.818
YOU SEE, I'M HAVING SOME
GREEN CARD PROBLEMS

07:23.901 --> 07:24.902
AND YOUR
INFLUENCE--

07:24.986 --> 07:26.863
- HEY, BUDDY.
LOOK AT YOU.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.489
[giggling]

07:28.573 --> 07:30.199
YOU CALL
THIS OBESE?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.201
THIS IS
HUSKY AT BEST.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.620
NOW YOU GO FIND ME A
FATTER KID OR A SMALLER SHIRT.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.080
NOW.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.749
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE BUFFET TABLE?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.176
- PLEASE STATE
YOUR NAME.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.886
- ELKA OSTROVSKY.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.722
I'M SINGLE.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.559
VERY SINGLE.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.686
A CAPRICORN.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.939
AND I LOVE NIGHTS
CURLED UP WITH A BOOK,

08:02.023 --> 08:06.277
AND A
SPECIAL SOMEONE.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.076
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY
LATE HUSBAND'S WISHES

08:14.160 --> 08:16.871
THAT THE STOLEN
ITEMS REMAIN HIDDEN.

08:16.954 --> 08:22.376
I'M POWERLESS IN THE
PRESENCE OF A REAL MAN.

08:24.503 --> 08:28.758
- I USED TO BE, TOO.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.260
- MRS. OSTROVSKY,
YOU CONTINUED TO HONOR

08:31.344 --> 08:33.221
YOUR LATE HUSBAND'S WISHES
AFTER HIS PASSING?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.431
- OH, YES.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.100
THOSE WERE
NOT EASY YEARS.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.729
SO, SO ALONE.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.024
SO IN NEED
OF COMFORT.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.947
- JUROR NUMBER EIGHT,
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:53.157 --> 08:55.451
YOU SEEM TO BE
BREATHING HEAVY.

08:55.534 --> 08:58.329
IT'S CREEPY
AND DISTRACTING.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.374
- DOING FINE,
YOUR HONOR.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.501
JUST FINE.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.463
AND THE WITNESS
MAY CONTINUE...

09:07.546 --> 09:09.757
AS LONG AS
SHE LIKES.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.685
- WOW, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE

09:20.768 --> 09:22.812
PROSECUTION HAS
A PRETTY STRONG CASE.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.689
- WHATEVER.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.649
- YOU DON'T SEEM VERY UPSET.
- RIGHT?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.318
I MEAN, THE CASE GOES
TO THE JURY TOMORROW.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.279
SHE KEEPS SAYING SHE'S
GOT AN ACE UP HER SLEEVE.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.530
- NOT AN ACE.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.991
A LETTER.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.494
FROM JUROR
NUMBER EIGHT.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.830
- "MEET ME IN THE
SECOND FLOOR BROOM CLOSET

09:40.913 --> 09:42.331
TOMORROW BEFORE COURT.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.042
I'LL HAVE MY DRIVER
DROP ME OFF A LITTLE EARLY."

09:45.126 --> 09:46.210
- YOUR DRIVER?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.546
HE SOUNDS RICH.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.797
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HOW RICH COULD HE BE

09:49.880 --> 09:52.508
IF HE COULDN'T
GET OFF JURY DUTY?

09:52.591 --> 09:54.343
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
GOING TO GO

09:54.427 --> 09:55.970
INTO A BROOM CLOSET
WITH A JUROR?

09:56.053 --> 09:57.513
ISN'T THAT
JURY TAMPERING?

09:57.596 --> 10:01.976
- IT IS IF YOU'RE
DOING IT RIGHT.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.019
- ELKA!

10:03.102 --> 10:04.353
- WHAT?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.647
FLIRTING WITH THE GUY
WAS YOUR IDEA.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.524
- YEAH, BUT I MEANT
JUST FLIRTING.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.359
- AND YOU COULD
GET INTO TROUBLE.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.194
I SAY AVOID
THE JURY TAMPERING

10:12.278 --> 10:14.030
AND JUST PRAY FOR
A LIGHT SENTENCE.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.865
- I DON'T
NEED PRAYER.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.452
I'VE GOT MY
BROOM CLOSET.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.661
- BROOM CLOSET?

10:20.745 --> 10:21.829
BOTH OF
YOU STANDING?

10:21.912 --> 10:25.750
I OBJECT.
MORALLY AND LOGISTICALLY.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.543
- HOW FAR ARE
YOU WILLING TO GO?

10:27.626 --> 10:32.089
- OH, PRETTY FAR.
I'M DESPERATE.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.718
ALSO, IT'S
BEEN A WHILE.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.906
JUSTICE HAS
BEEN SERVICED.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.119
- I WONDER HOW LONG
THE JURY WILL DELIBERATE.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.454
- DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.415
- DID YOU...

11:06.499 --> 11:10.628
- I MET WITH A CERTAIN JUROR ON
A SUBJECT OF MUTUAL INTEREST.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.715
- ALL RIGHT, I HAVE
IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS

11:14.799 --> 11:16.175
AND IT'S NOT
EVEN ABOUT ME.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.593
- HAVE YOU HEARD
SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRIAL?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.095
- IT'S ABOUT JOY.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.764
YOUR THE GOVERNOR'S HOOKER.
- WHAT?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.432
- WELL, THERE'S A
PICTURE OF YOU ON HIS LAP,

11:23.516 --> 11:26.102
IT'S THE LEAD STORY ON
CHANNEL SEVEN'S WEBSITE.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.397
- "GOV IN PHOTO SCANDAL
WITH MYSTERY STRADDLER?"

11:29.480 --> 11:32.233
- WELL, I HAD TO SIT
ON TOP OF HIM FOR LEVERAGE.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.777
I PRACTICALLY NEEDED A
CHAIN SAW TO THIN THOSE BROWS,

11:34.860 --> 11:37.613
I HAD TO USE A
NUMBER SEVEN TWEEZER.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.742
IF YOU WERE IN THE BUSINESS,
YOU'D KNOW HOW EXTREME THAT WAS.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.327
GOD, THIS IS TERRIBLE.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.578
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.913
YOU CAN'T
SEE YOUR FACE.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.748
- OH, IT'S HER ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THE HAND.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.085
- OH, YEAH.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.171
- WHAT ABOUT MY HAND?
- IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN HAND.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.965
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

11:56.048 --> 11:56.924
IT'S JUST THE
ANGLE OF THE PICTURE.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.634
MY HAND IS
FORESHORTENED.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.637
- DOES THAT MEAN IT
LOOKS LIKE A DUDE'S?

12:01.721 --> 12:02.972
- COME ON.
LOOK AT HER LEGS.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.807
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT A MAN'S LEG.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.601
- YES, THOSE BELONG TO
A BEAUTIFUL, SEXY WOMAN.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.228
- THANK YOU.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.771
- WHO WILL REVEAL HER STEAMY
AFFAIR WITH THE GOVERNOR

12:10.855 --> 12:15.151
ON MY SHOW,
"OH, HI, OHIO."

12:15.234 --> 12:16.861
- BUT YOU KNOW I'M
JUST PLUCKING HIS EYE BROWS.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.154
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.947
OH, PLEASE SAY THAT
YOU'RE HIS HOOKER.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.450
- NO, THEN I'LL NEVER
GET MY GREEN CARD.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.659
I'LL GO ON YOUR SHOW
AND TELL THE TRUTH.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.994
- THE TRUTH?

12:25.077 --> 12:28.622
WELL, MY VIEWERS
DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.624
- HASN'T THE GOVERNOR'S
OFFICE SAID ANYTHING YET?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.001
- NO, NOT A WORD.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.170
SO I COULD OWN THIS STORY
IF YOU'D JUST PLAY BALL.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.881
- LIKE A DUDE.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.175
- NO, AND
THAT'S FINAL.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.594
[slams down gavel]

12:41.677 --> 12:42.553
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

12:42.636 --> 12:45.890
THE JURY HAS
REACHED A VERDICT.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.018
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT LOOKING AT ME?

12:49.101 --> 12:51.812
THAT MESSED UP FACE
IS FREAKING ME OUT.

13:04.867 --> 13:09.830
WE THE JURY FIND
THE DEFENDANT, ELKA OSTROVSKY...

13:09.914 --> 13:12.541
- WATCH ME
ACT SURPRISED.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.503
- GUILTY.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.838
- WHAT?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.674
- DEFENDANT WILL REMAIN
FREE ON BAIL UNTIL SENTENCING.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.093
AND DEFENSE COUNSEL
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE

13:23.177 --> 13:26.597
FOR ALL ANCILLARY COURT COSTS,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED,

13:26.680 --> 13:29.391
TO THE $800 THE COURT
SPENT ON THIS DAMN WEAVE.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.227
[slams down gavel]

13:34.772 --> 13:35.606
- NOW DON'T PANIC.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.399
THE JUDGE STILL HAS
A LOT OF DISCRETION

13:37.483 --> 13:38.859
WHEN IT COMES
TO SENTENCING.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.361
NOW IF YOU'LL ALL
TESTIFY ON HER BEHALF,

13:40.444 --> 13:41.904
AND I'LL TURN
ON THE CHARM.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.241
- IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR FACE HAS
GOTTEN EVEN LESS ATTRACTIVE?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.951
- IT HAS?

13:47.034 --> 13:48.786
OH, DAMN.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.580
I THINK I'M HAVING AN
ALLERGIC REACTION TO THE SALVE.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.791
- ARE YOU...CRYING?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.751
- SOME OF IT IS
MY STITCHES WEEPING.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.044
BUT...

13:57.127 --> 13:58.754
YEAH, I AM
A LITTLE UPSET.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.756
WOMEN ARE BEING
SO MEAN TO ME.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.132
NOBODY'S
OPENING A DOOR,

14:02.216 --> 14:03.717
OR HOLDING
AN ELEVATOR.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.596
I HAD TO TEAR OPEN MY OWN
SUGAR PACKET AT STARBUCK'S!

14:07.680 --> 14:10.266
I NEED A MOMENT.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.809
- WHAT WENT WRONG?

14:11.892 --> 14:13.936
I THOUGHT YOU TAMPERED
WITH JUROR NUMBER EIGHT.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.438
- I TAMPERED THE
HECK OUT OF HIM.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.441
- OH, THERE HE IS NOW.
LET'S GO GET HIM.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.402
- YOU!
- I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HER.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.737
- WHO?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.782
HELLO.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.284
- SORRY, HE'S HAVING
A LITTLE EPISODE.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.994
IT HAPPENS FROM
TIME TO TIME.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.704
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"AN EPISODE?"

14:31.787 --> 14:32.955
- HE SUFFERS FROM
A CONDITION CALLED

14:33.038 --> 14:35.291
"TRANSIENT
GLOBAL AMNESIA."

14:35.374 --> 14:36.792
IF HE GETS
OVER STIMULATED

14:36.875 --> 14:39.128
HE LOSES HIS
SHORT-TERM MEMORY FOR A WHILE.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.004
SOMETHING MUST
HAVE GOTTEN HIM

14:40.087 --> 14:44.967
EXCITED THIS MORNING
AND TRIGGERED IT.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.135
- HE FORGOT EVERYTHING?

14:46.218 --> 14:50.806
- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN BREAKFAST AND LUNCH.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.183
- YOU POOR BOW-TIED
SON-OF-A-GUN.

14:53.267 --> 14:58.063
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU HAD.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.316
- HELLO.

15:12.036 --> 15:16.957
- YOU COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER?
- MM-MM.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.000
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

15:18.083 --> 15:19.126
WHAT I'M GONNA SAY AT
ELKA'S SENTENCING HEARING.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.044
I'M SO
SCARED FOR HER.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.254
- YEAH, ME TOO.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.547
IT'S SO HARD
TO BELIEVE THAT

15:23.631 --> 15:26.008
THEY COULD ACTUALLY
SEND HER TO JAIL.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.051
- I KNOW.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.802
PRISON.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.846
IT'S HORRIBLE.

15:30.929 --> 15:34.183
- WELL, NOT ALWAYS.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.352
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW,</i>
WHEN HONOR ST. RAVEN

15:36.435 --> 15:38.520
WENT IN FOR
DOUBLE-MURDER,

15:38.604 --> 15:40.356
SHE WAS RELEASED
AFTER SIX WEEKS

15:40.439 --> 15:42.816
FOR SAVING THE WARDEN'S CHILDREN
FROM AN AXE MURDERESS.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.068
AND NOT
ONLY THAT,

15:44.151 --> 15:46.528
SHE EARNED A DEGREE
IN ADVANCED BIONICS

15:46.612 --> 15:49.198
FROM THE YALE UNIVERSITY
OF CORRESPONDENCE.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.869
SO SOMETIMES PRISON IS
JUST WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.205
- ELKA'S GONNA BE THERE
MORE THAN SIX WEEKS.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.749
- AH, WELL THEN SHE
CAN GET TWO DEGREES.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.042
SORRY.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.336
I JOKE WHEN
I'M SCARED.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.380
I GUESS I FIGURE THAT
IF I ACT AS IF

16:04.463 --> 16:06.757
IT ISN'T SERIOUS,
MAYBE IT WON'T BE.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.550
- UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.719
- OH.
YOU TOO, HUH?

16:10.803 --> 16:15.224
- I KEEP PICTURING ELKA
ALONE IN A COLD, DARK CELL.

16:15.307 --> 16:19.520
BUT THAT IMAGE HAS LOST
ITS HAPPY GLOW FOR ME.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.729
- YOU KNOW, IF
NONE OF US CAN SLEEP

16:20.813 --> 16:22.398
I BET ELKA'S STILL UP.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.857
- HER LIGHT'S STILL ON.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.111
- SHE'S PROBABLY GOING
CRAZY WITH ANXIETY.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.738
POUR HER A CUP OF TEA,
I'LL GO GET HER.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.365
- GOD, WHAT A DAY.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.366
ELKA GETTING
CONVICTED,

16:32.449 --> 16:36.370
AND YOU LITERALLY
MAN-HANDLING THE GOVERNOR.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.081
GOD, I COULD USE THAT AS
A LEAD-IN TO MY STORY.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.917
- THERE IS
NO STORY.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.377
I JUST WISH I COULD GET
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

16:43.460 --> 16:44.795
TO RETURN
MY PHONE CALLS

16:44.878 --> 16:47.423
BEFORE SOMEONE ID'S ME
AND I GET DEPORTED.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.133
- NOW, SEE, THIS IS WHY
YOU HAVE TO STRIKE FIRST.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.426
NOW LET ME GET
YOUR STORY OUT.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.719
TELL THE WORLD ABOUT

16:51.802 --> 16:55.055
THE GOVERNOR'S
"SEX FOR AMNESTY" SCHEME.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.058
- THERE WAS NO
"SEX FOR AMNESTY" SCHEME.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.729
MOSTLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T
THINK OF IT FAST ENOUGH.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.106
WHY CAN'T I JUST SAY
I WAS PLUCKING HIS BROWS?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.441
- WELL, WHY SAY THAT
WHEN I CAN

17:05.523 --> 17:07.233
TURN YOU INTO
SOMETHING MUCH BETTER.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.819
A CELEBRITY VICTIM.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.779
NOW SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT OUR COUNTRY,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.073
BUT WE DO NOT
DEPORT OUR CELEBRITIES.

17:13.156 --> 17:17.618
NO, AT WORST, WE EXILE
THEM TO REALITY SHOWS.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.621
- SHE'S GONE.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.830
ELKA'S GONE.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.833
- WELL, WHERE
DID SHE GO?

17:22.915 --> 17:24.292
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE'S
GONE AND SHE LEFT A NOTE.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.461
- WHAT'S IT SAY?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.628
- "I'M GONE."

17:27.713 --> 17:28.964
- THAT'S IT?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.967
- "P.S. SORRY TO GO WITHOUT
SAYING GOOD-BYE,

17:32.050 --> 17:33.802
BUT WHEN I REALIZED
MY SENTENCE DEPENDED ON

17:33.886 --> 17:37.139
WHATEVER HALF-BAKED TESTIMONY
YOU THREE BIRD-BRAINS COOKED UP,

17:37.222 --> 17:40.893
I DECIDED TO TAKE MY CHANCES
AND LIGHT OUT FOR THE TERRITORY.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.853
- WHAT'S THAT?
"LIGHT OUT FOR THE TERRITORY?"

17:42.936 --> 17:45.147
- IT MEANS
SHE WENT WEST.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.316
"P.P.S. THERE'S MORE
INTERNET PICTURES

17:47.399 --> 17:50.027
OF THE GOVERNOR GETTING OFF
WITH LADY FRENCH FRY.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.196
- OH, MY GOD, NO.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.447
- LADY FRENCH FRY.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.115
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.951
- "P.P.P.S. JOY,
I MAY NOT SEE YOU AGAIN,

17:58.035 --> 18:00.871
AND I'VE BEEN SITTING ON
"LADY FRENCH FRY" FOR A WEEK.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.164
I HAD TO GET IT
OFF MY CHEST.

18:02.247 --> 18:07.377
IF YOU HAD A CHEST,
YOU'D KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.546
- SHE LOVED TO
INSULT MY CHEST.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.839
AND MY HAIR.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.884
AND MY INABILITY
TO HOLD ON TO A MAN.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.844
AND MY INTELLIGENCE.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.514
AND MY MORALS.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.517
SHE'S LIKE
A MOTHER TO ME.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.978
- YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S
ACTUALLY GONE WEST, DO YOU?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.064
- WHAT STATE IS
WEST OF OHIO?

18:27.147 --> 18:32.361
- I WANNA
SAY MARYLAND.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.695
- WELL, SHE'S
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.989
AND WE HAVE TO FIND HER
BEFORE THE POLICE DO.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.867
WHERE WOULD SHE
GO TO HIDE OUT?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.668
- IF YOU'RE BACK HERE,
WHO'S DRIVING THE WAGON?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.086
- THE HORSE,
NATURALLY.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.380
RELAX THYSELF.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.841
SHE KNOWS
THE WAY.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.843
- SO WHERE
WE'RE GOING,

18:55.926 --> 18:59.179
I'M COMPLETELY CUT OFF
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD?

18:59.263 --> 19:02.099
- INDEED.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.101
- WORKS FOR ME.
