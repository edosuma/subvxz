Wouldn't do that shit, nigga.

36:37.788 --> 36:40.622
Oh, ain't no friendly faces
out there.

36:40.724 --> 36:43.759
Only your just desserts.

36:43.861 --> 36:47.362
-Franklin: Who are you?
-I guess the better
question is...

36:47.464 --> 36:48.964
What have I become?

36:49.066 --> 36:51.567
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, man.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.402
Your life.

36:55.973 --> 36:59.107
Your life is my failure.

36:59.210 --> 37:02.945
-What?
-You messed it up.

37:03.047 --> 37:05.180
(laughs)

37:05.282 --> 37:07.749
I messed it up for you?

37:07.852 --> 37:11.687
What-- sitting in some
shitty-ass cubicle,

37:11.789 --> 37:13.522
wiping the white man's ass?

37:13.624 --> 37:14.923
Oh, the white man.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.092
White man ain't your problem.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.127
-Not yet.
-No, no.

37:19.230 --> 37:21.830
I don't have problems.
Shit, I solve them.

37:23.167 --> 37:25.067
Mm.

37:25.169 --> 37:26.735

37:26.837 --> 37:29.271

come true for you.

37:30.341 --> 37:31.940
-For us.
-That's bullshit.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.976
He never cared about
anybody but himself.

37:34.078 --> 37:35.944
He said he was working
for the people,

37:36.046 --> 37:37.512
but as soon as somebody
crossed him, what'd he do?

37:37.615 --> 37:39.114
He threw them
right under the bus.

37:39.216 --> 37:41.516
And here you are talking
about the white man's ass

37:41.619 --> 37:44.519
when everybody got to kiss
your ass, or else.

37:44.622 --> 37:46.788
What the f... I help people.

37:46.891 --> 37:49.091
(laughs)
help people?

37:49.193 --> 37:50.826
My god, you listen to yourself?

37:50.928 --> 37:54.029
Goddamn, nigga.

37:54.131 --> 37:55.464
What about mr. Wright?
What about him?

37:55.566 --> 37:58.567
What about kevin and even rob?
Or manboy? Your dad?

37:58.669 --> 38:00.602

38:14.852 --> 38:17.352
-That's how you help, franklin?
-No, no, no, no.

38:17.454 --> 38:20.856
No, I made
me and my people rich.

38:20.958 --> 38:22.991
Fuck kind of life
would they have without me?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.426
(stifled laugh)

38:24.528 --> 38:26.561
(cackles)

38:29.300 --> 38:32.467
they don't see it
that way, nigga.

38:32.569 --> 38:35.637
And they never will.
And you don't see it theirs.

38:35.739 --> 38:39.975
And that's why this whole
thing's about to fall apart.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.980
Nothing's gonna fall apart.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.715
I can still save it.

38:50.921 --> 38:52.154
You know...

38:54.124 --> 38:56.158
