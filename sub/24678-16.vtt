Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:03.670 --> 00:07.174
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.207 --> 00:08.811
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.482
These are their stories.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.064
The bus to the city, where do I catch it?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.514
She moved.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.016
Said she wanted to be closer to work.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.315
What?
She-- She got a new job?

00:41.341 --> 00:42.945
A jewelry store.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.354
She sent us a spoon for the baby.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.758
It came in a fancy blue and gold box.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.695
Barber: Blue and gold box, huh?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.701
I don't know about those fancy jewelry stores.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.896
They're all up on Fifth Avenue.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.307
Woman: The buyers are coming in the morning.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.140
I really do need those
brochures by tomorrow.

01:06.166 --> 01:10.239
Okay, but what I really want to know
is what leader of the free world

01:10.270 --> 01:12.375
did your mystery man have lunch with today?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.613
The president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.484
Oh, I've heard that name before.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.319
Oh no, I'm thinking of Donna Summers.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.986
Anyway, at least one of us
is leading an exciting life.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.393
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow. Taxi!

01:31.325 --> 01:34.568
We did get a day outside Nairobi
to visit the old coffee plantations.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.041
It nearly made up for the seminars.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.843
"Realistic Debt Consolidation."

01:41.868 --> 01:44.109
We met with-- oh, that rock star,

01:44.137 --> 01:46.879
the one who's campaigning
to cancel Third World debt.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.515
Gerry, your work is so interesting.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.786
You're lying, but I love it.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.688
Gerry...

02:00.721 --> 02:03.224
Have you thought any more about...

02:03.256 --> 02:06.328
Taking our relationship to the next level?

02:08.495 --> 02:11.999
Charlotte, you know how I feel about you,

02:12.032 --> 02:14.034
but I also believe that...

02:15.168 --> 02:17.739
Sex is a sacrament of marriage.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.809
Tonight could be so special.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.345
I can't. I promised Larry Summers
I'd meet him for dessert at the Waldorf.

02:24.378 --> 02:28.155
He's having a bunch of the old gang from
the London School of Economics over.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.455
I'll go with you.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.294
- No, it'll be so boring.
- I want to meet your friends.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.698
Just let me go home and change.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.465
Give me five minutes.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.340
( door opens )

02:53.373 --> 02:56.320
- Hey, hey, hey, what--
- Shut up.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.448
- You must be the boyfriend.
- Who are you?

02:58.478 --> 03:00.480
Never mind about that, just drive.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.476
Something the matter, Ms. Fielding?

03:18.498 --> 03:20.978
Did someone come in
and leave a message for me?

03:21.001 --> 03:23.003
No, no messages.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.984
So now I'm eating like a primitive man, right?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.987
Lamb, fish, lots of kale and broccoli--

03:29.009 --> 03:32.821
all the cruciferous vegetables.
It's awesome, it's like--

03:32.846 --> 03:35.224
Whoa. Check it out.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.022
I'm calling 911.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.372
( theme music playing )

04:40.847 --> 04:43.555
Man: Body was discovered
at the Botanical Gardens.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.460
Frank Raymond Caspari.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.658
Paroled out of Sing Sing two days ago.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.633
Did six years for armed robbery.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.500
I thought since Major Case
handled that back then

04:52.526 --> 04:55.166
you'd do me a favor and catch this one, too.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.108
That's what I live for, Valdez,
to make your life easier.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.668
I take it you'll be by later
to wash my car?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.841
Multiple stab wounds to the chest.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.782
Knife was recovered in the bushes,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.684
only fingerprints were Caspari.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.517
Killed with his own knife.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.423
Caspari and two accomplices jacked an OTB

05:13.446 --> 05:15.687
for $1.2 million bucks.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.218
$400 grand each. The money
was never recovered.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.424
And the two accomplices?

05:20.453 --> 05:22.490
Caspari never gave them up.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.296
The body was dumped off a service road.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.634
Very isolated,

05:27.661 --> 05:30.608
no foot traffic.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.975
A hundred bucks. Smells like perfume.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.809
That's Barbicide.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.117
The blue stuff they use to disinfect
combs in barber shops.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.623
He's got a new haircut.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.023
It's not prison issue.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.653
Fresh manicure.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.891
Maybe a friendly barber lent him the money.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.663
He's got scuff marks on the back of his shoes.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.469
He was dragged to where they killed him?

06:03.797 --> 06:06.937
- No defensive wounds.
- Here.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.938
1985 Caspari was arrested
for fencing stolen jewelry

06:10.971 --> 06:14.509
out of the back of a barber shop
owned by Benny Franconi.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.789
If Caspari loaned you a few bucks, we
might be able to see you get it back.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.625
It was about a thousand bucks.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.460
It was $50 bucks.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.797
It was $100, missy, and not a penny less.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.632
He came by yesterday.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.467
He said he was going to pay me back.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.973
He was always good about that sort of thing.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.567
Pay you back from his share of the OTB job?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.443
That's none of my business.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.948
Frank being murdered is not your business?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.677
What kind of friend are you?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.819
What are you talking about?

06:48.842 --> 06:51.288
We think his accomplices
on the OTB job killed him.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.688
He kept his mouth shut for six years...

06:58.919 --> 07:01.263
This is the thanks he gets?

07:03.957 --> 07:07.461
Mikey Squiers, Dave Vender.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.136
One's doing life at Five Points.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.940
The other OD'd on junk two years ago.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.947
How about where Frank was staying?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.846
I don't know.

07:17.871 --> 07:21.842
He used to see a girl in Queens
named Connie Moran.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.947
Asked me a couple of times
about a jewelry store

07:24.978 --> 07:27.151
that used blue and gold boxes.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.053
Figured he had a date.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.897
Last time I saw Frank, there
was a piece of glass between us.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.596
That was six years ago. I haven't cared since.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.469
- ( children arguing )
- Don't make me come up there!

07:42.829 --> 07:44.536
So what's Frank done now?

07:44.564 --> 07:47.841
He got killed two days after he got out.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.342
Oh, Jeez, Frank.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.877
I guess I care now, don't I?

07:55.909 --> 07:58.150
You fell hard for him.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.987
He was a crook,

08:00.013 --> 08:01.583
but he made me feel special.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.924
Six years in jail was too long a wait.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.931
I would've waited. Problem was, I had company.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.092
- He had a girl on the side?
- Yeah.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.295
Secretary at his lawyer's office

08:11.324 --> 08:14.271
told me he was writing letters
to this other woman.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.296
You know her name?

08:17.197 --> 08:19.268
Charlotte. Charlotte Fielding.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.439
I'm baking cookies and schlepping
them up to Sing Sing every week,

08:22.469 --> 08:23.880
and he's writing her letters.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.382
You know where we could find her?

08:26.473 --> 08:28.510
No. Why does it matter?

08:28.541 --> 08:31.818
Frank's share of the OTB
heist is still missing.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.260
I wish he left it with me.

08:37.283 --> 08:41.163
- I don't know a Frank Caspari.
- He wrote letters from prison to
a Charlotte Fielding.

08:41.187 --> 08:45.158
- You're the only Charlotte Fielding
in the phone book.
- My number isn't listed.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.727
It is in our phone book.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.207
You made a mistake. Now I'm going to be late.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.672
Frank Caspari was murdered
a couple of days ago.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.380
So now do you know him?

09:05.612 --> 09:09.856
I did, a long time ago.
But I'd lost contact with him.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.591
This was an intimate relationship?

09:14.788 --> 09:16.768
It was very short-lived. I was slumming.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.100
But he wrote you from prison?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.934
He wanted my help,

09:20.960 --> 09:23.770
to talk to the right people,
get him a better lawyer.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.244
He thought you had those kinds
of connections with influential people?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.373
Well, friends, husbands of friends.

09:31.971 --> 09:35.111
You went to school with those people,
grew up with them?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.782
Well, yes.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.652
What school-- Brearley, Spence?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.586
Brearley.

09:44.617 --> 09:47.188
Are you wearing those invisible braces?

09:47.220 --> 09:50.463
Because you keep running your
tongue over the back of your teeth.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.128
Yes, I am.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.968
I'm thinking about getting my teeth fixed.
Are they comfortable?

09:54.994 --> 09:57.201
You get used to it. Now, please, I--

09:59.999 --> 10:03.105
Those are-- those are lovely earrings.
Are they family heirlooms?

10:03.136 --> 10:07.516
- They're from Harry Winston.
- The place that uses the blue and gold gift boxes?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.315
I work in their corporate sales.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.687
The day he was killed, Caspari was
asking about blue and gold gift boxes.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.453
Sounds like he was trying to find you.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.257
Well, he didn't.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.840
Her and Caspari-- I don't see it.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.967
Maybe it wasn't as big a step down

10:30.997 --> 10:33.170
as she'd like us to think.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.769
Her teeth--

10:34.801 --> 10:38.271
Brearley girls get their teeth
fixed when they're 14,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.181
not 34.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.186
They asked all sorts of questions.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.188
Why didn't you tell me Frank was dead?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.884
I didn't know. I told you,
he jumped in the can he had a knife,

10:46.913 --> 10:49.621
he told me to drive around.
A cop car pulled up next to us

10:49.649 --> 10:51.925
and he jumped out. I could've been killed.

10:51.951 --> 10:55.728
I really need to see you.
Couldn't you take a later flight?

10:55.755 --> 10:58.201
I can't, I'm pulling into the airport now.
I have to go.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.228
- I'll call you from Rome, okay?
- Charlotte: I already miss you.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.935
Gerry: I’ll call you, I promise.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.277
Daddy!

11:07.300 --> 11:09.507
- Dad!
- Hey!

11:10.904 --> 11:12.906
Hey, what's in the bag?

11:12.939 --> 11:16.614
It's candy from the Turkish
Minister of Finance,

11:16.643 --> 11:18.623
but I told him my children don't like candy.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.023
You can each have one piece before dinner.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.027
Now go wash your hands.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.224
How's my best girl?

11:26.252 --> 11:28.698
She's just happy you're home.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.997
I missed you so much today.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.072
Autopsy came in. We have
2 types of stab wounds.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.939
Deep ones through the heart and lungs,

11:38.965 --> 11:41.377
and shallow ones barely penetrating the skin.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.473
Hesitation marks.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.576
The killer didn't know
how much force to use-- first-timer.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.348
Tox screen was negative for drugs.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.919
And here's why Caspari didn't put up a fight.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.756
- Burns from a stun gun.
- High on his left thigh.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.456
He might've been sitting
in the passenger seat of a car,

11:58.484 --> 12:01.055
the driver reached over and zapped him.

12:01.087 --> 12:03.124
Ohh.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.295
From the Office of Public Records--

12:05.325 --> 12:07.134
until seven years ago,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.970
Charlotte Fielding was Charlene Caspari.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.907
Frank's little sister.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.980
A legal name change.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.813
Right after Frank was arrested
for the OTB heist.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.149
She was trying to outrun his notoriety.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.849
It looks like she was trying to outrun him.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.850
She had an apartment on Jane Street.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.353
And then three months ago,

12:33.386 --> 12:35.332
she unlisted her phone number,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.494
and moved to a sublet at the Wendicott.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.436
Three months ago is when Frank
found out he was being paroled.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.168
Yes, if he'd left the heist money with her,

12:43.196 --> 12:46.075
maybe she wasn't eager to give it back.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.103
She got somebody to kill him. A first-timer.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.012
A boyfriend.

12:51.037 --> 12:54.746
One thing this line of work teaches us
is that guys will do anything for love.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.185
And money.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.919
I never seen this guy. No way.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.055
You ever seen Ms. Fielding with other men?

13:07.487 --> 13:11.367
I never saw Ms. Fielding with a guy,
but, yeah, she goes out every other week,

13:11.391 --> 13:13.530
comes back in a good mood usually.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.335
- Last Tuesday night?
- Yeah, she went out all dressed up.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.172
She came back 10 seconds
later, she was pissed.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.974
She asked me if somebody
had left her a message.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.982
She got stood up. She friends
with anybody in the building?

13:27.340 --> 13:30.412
Frank Caspari? No, she
never mentioned the name.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.822
I really don't know Charlotte very well.
I met her at the gym, we had coffee.

13:33.846 --> 13:37.123
- She seems to be from a good family.
- Bouillabaisse.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.255
Yeah, for my husband's birthday.

13:39.285 --> 13:43.097
I gave the cook the night off, but my culinary
skills are challenged to say the least.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.726
You just need to reduce the stock.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.169
My, what do they teach
you at the police academy?

13:47.193 --> 13:49.070
Your doorman thinks she has a boyfriend.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.474
If you can call him that.
Apparently he travels a lot.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.500
I've heard that excuse before.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.343
Charlotte's very protective of him.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.680
I barely got his first name out of her.
I've never even seen a photo of him.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.947
Do you know what he does for a living?

14:01.974 --> 14:04.955
He's some sort of an economist,
I think at the UN.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.116
At least he can help her
balance her checkbook.

14:07.146 --> 14:10.150
He's doing more than that.
She gave him her savings to invest.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.993
She's brave. How much money
are we talking about?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.397
Substantial, I think.
She said it's family money.

14:18.157 --> 14:20.159
Here, try this.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.703
The only money I ever got from my family

14:23.730 --> 14:26.267
was the $50 bucks my dad
gave me for my prom dress.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.974
Was that the same year you were selling
apples in front of the city hall?

14:30.002 --> 14:32.710
It was matchsticks, and it was snowing. Yes?

14:34.006 --> 14:35.986
Okay. Thank you.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.318
No sign of Frank's loot.

14:38.344 --> 14:42.315
Charlotte's savings account's stayed put
at four grand for the last five years.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.658
- Her phone records.
- Talk about mishegas.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.322
I just got off the phone
with the UN.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.731
They need more than a first name
before they open their employment rolls.

14:49.756 --> 14:54.432
I'm not seeing any calls here to
anyone named Gerry or to the UN.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.168
Same here. But the night Frank was killed,

14:57.196 --> 15:00.803
she made a dozen calls to a pager
registered under her name.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.278
She was paging herself?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.010
Well, let's find out.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.619
This is Detective Robert Goren
of the New York City Police Department.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.628
We're curious why Charlotte Fielding

15:17.650 --> 15:21.097
would call this pager number
the night Frank Caspari was killed.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.929
If it's not too much trouble,

15:22.955 --> 15:27.631
could you call us back at 555-0146?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.503
Thank you.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.669
Eames: You ready?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.016
Yeah... let's play.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.515
Here she comes.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.570
- You're early.
- No. They told me 1:00.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.371
My...

16:10.403 --> 16:11.848
Watch?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.441
It stopped.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.510
Uh, come in. Sit down.

16:15.541 --> 16:19.455
I'm sorry we had to play phone tag
the last couple of days.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.459
It's just been crazy around here.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.121
And now you're here,
you have our full attention.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.529
First of all, I want you to stop
interrogating my neighbors.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.057
- I live in a very conservative building.
- We tried to be discreet.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.696
And I want to know
how you got my pager number.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.799
It's just one of these things we're able
to do when we're investigating a murder.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.835
I told you, I have not seen nor heard
from Frank Caspari in years.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.678
I believe you. Okay?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
I come from a family of cops.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.786
But why did you call your own pager?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.924
I lent it to a married friend.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.191
She uses it so her boyfriend can call her.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.262
That Tuesday night,

17:03.289 --> 17:05.394
you called it 11 times.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.564
This friend, this married friend,

17:08.594 --> 17:10.096
had set me up on a blind date.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.801
I was stood up...

17:12.932 --> 17:14.536
And I was upset.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.979
I'm sure you can understand.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.483
Everything okay?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.976
Yes, I...

17:24.010 --> 17:27.719
You weren't supposed to see this.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.996
Now you know we know.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.503
Charlene "Cookie" Caspari.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.637
Frankie's little sister.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.808
Actually, he was the first
one to see through your act.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.282
It's your teeth.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.982
Well...

17:57.009 --> 17:59.888
Charlotte Fielding would've
had them fixed 20 years ago.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.118
You had your nose fixed.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.992
And you had really big hair back then.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.758
Screw you.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.322
Ooh.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.960
Well, you can take the girl
out of Bensonhurst,

18:10.990 --> 18:13.470
but you can't take Bensonhurst out of--

18:13.492 --> 18:17.497
I bet that you had a vocal coach.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.237
I don't have anything to prove to you.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.269
- We're not putting you down, Cookie.
- Stop calling me that.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.008
You were a good student at John Jay.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.573
Debating team, volleyball team,
beautician's club.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.017
All those people you fooled,

18:28.040 --> 18:31.613
they all must've been
very impressed by your stories.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.124
Like this boyfriend, Gerry...

18:34.146 --> 18:36.990
What-- what-- what's-his-name?

18:37.016 --> 18:39.656
You told them he was an economist?

18:39.685 --> 18:42.131
- Probably a $20 an hour bookkeeper.
- He's not.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.963
He works for the United Nations.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.402
You met at a seminar on
Keynesian market theory?

18:46.425 --> 18:48.029
No, at Harry Winston,

18:48.060 --> 18:50.631
during our exhibit of
antique cigarette holders.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.540
- He's a collector.
- Oh, stop!

18:54.700 --> 18:58.170
You really lay it on thick there, Cookie.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.378
- I told you not to—
- It must've been a shock
when Frankie showed up.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.752
- Threatening to blow your cover!
- There's no cover to blow.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.053
Cookie doesn't exist, she's gone and I'm here.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.219
The proof I'm no longer that big-haired,
gum-popping, home girl

19:10.249 --> 19:14.026
is the fact that this man
you morons call my boyfriend

19:14.053 --> 19:15.862
is a successful, intelligent,

19:15.888 --> 19:18.994
Columbia PhD, London School
of Economics graduate,

19:19.025 --> 19:22.199
who just last week had lunch
with the president of Harvard.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.573
This sophisticated, cultivated
man of the world

19:25.598 --> 19:29.444
loves me and wants to make a life with me!

19:29.468 --> 19:33.245
Charlotte Fielding, not Cookie Caspari!

19:40.646 --> 19:42.648
(sighs)

19:46.152 --> 19:47.995
You played me.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.466
Good cop, bad cop.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.969
( Brooklyn accent )
I shoulda remembered--

19:58.998 --> 20:01.501
all cops are bad cops.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.914
(mimics accent)
She "shoulda remembered."

20:11.277 --> 20:13.484
Charlotte: They didn't ask about the money,

20:13.512 --> 20:15.651
but I'm sure they suspect something.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.285
I think we're lost.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.131
Do you have Mr. Annan's phone number?

20:21.153 --> 20:25.329
I'm not calling the Secretary General
of the United Nations for directions.

20:25.357 --> 20:29.032
Check the glove box. I think
I have a better map in there.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.842
You didn't tell them anything about me?

20:32.865 --> 20:35.778
No, but they're bound to find out.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.341
What’s this?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.715
I was going to wait, but...

20:44.543 --> 20:47.319
Oh, Gerry. Does this mean--?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.883
With all my heart.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.804
This person would've had lunch
with Mr. Summers last week.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.465
He'd be in his late 30s or 40s,

21:03.496 --> 21:04.975
with a PhD from Columbia.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.704
It could've been New York or Boston.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.474
Is there anyone else
in the alumni office I should speak to?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.140
Thanks, anyway.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.640
The president of Harvard's been
in Africa the last three weeks.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.313
Gerry likes to make up stories
about knowing famous people.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.981
(ringing)

21:19.011 --> 21:21.150
Major Case, Detective Eames.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.182
Which hospital?

21:27.186 --> 21:29.166
Doctor: She's in a coma.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.863
She's lucky to be alive.
if the state troopers hadn't found her..

21:32.892 --> 21:36.669
- Eames: What’s the prognosis?
- She could remain like this indefinitely.

21:36.695 --> 21:40.040
- Goren: Bruises on the neck.
- They're consistent with
manual strangulation.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.739
The perp might've been interrupted in the act.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.476
Look, same place as Frankie's.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.816
Doctor: I didn't know what those were.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.220
Stun gun burns.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.696
Charlotte's book only has his first name.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.959
No address, no home or office number.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.627
She noted every date that she had with him.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.466
And his itinerary.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.472
Gerry in Geneva, Gerry in Milan,

22:08.494 --> 22:10.132
Gerry in Hong Kong.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.971
No pictures of him.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.136
It's a handbook from a conference.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.976
"Realistic Debt Consolidation" in Nairobi.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.212
My boyfriend went to Kenya
and all I got was this lousy brochure.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.153
This guy knows the way to a girl's heart.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.317
Souvenirs he brought her.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.485
Wooden shoes, geisha doll.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.495
What’s that?

22:31.517 --> 22:34.123
It's a UN schedule of conferences.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.134
So far they match Gerry's
travel dates in her day-timer.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.830
We get the list of attendees,
maybe we can find Gerry.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.861
The day-timer has Gerry in Johannesburg

22:41.894 --> 22:43.999
for something called the Mkunga conference.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.168
"Mkunga" is Swahili for midwives.

22:46.198 --> 22:50.442
What's an economist doing
at a conference on midwives?

23:15.427 --> 23:18.101
Woman: Maybe our legal office
wasn't clear with you.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.270
I have to contact the organizing
committee at each conference locale.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.439
Only they have a final list of attendees.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.972
It could take weeks if not months.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.543
I was told you could inspire people
to do the impossible.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.524
These are the conferences we're interested in.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.487
Your economist attended these?

23:38.517 --> 23:42.055
We matched his travel schedule
with a calendar of conferences.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.658
You must have been working
off an old calendar.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.499
There have been amendments.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.334
You should've come to me sooner.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.569
If I'd only known how charming
the experience would be.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.645
This conference on trade tariffs in December,

23:56.669 --> 23:59.343
that was moved from Hong Kong to Shanghai.

23:59.371 --> 24:03.751
And this banking conference in Milan,
that was canceled for security reasons.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.780
The man we're looking for
gave his girlfriend this handbook

24:06.812 --> 24:08.792
from a conference in Nairobi last month.

24:08.814 --> 24:12.193
Is there any way he could've gotten it
without attending the conference?

24:12.217 --> 24:15.755
Yes, from our publications office.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.496
The publications office got
a request two weeks ago

24:18.524 --> 24:20.333
from someone saying he was a reporter.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.997
It was left at the reception desk.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.234
They know exactly what day it was picked up.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.470
We're looking at security tapes of the lobby.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.977
How many candidates so far?

24:28.000 --> 24:32.346
Caucasian males, late 30s to 40s-- about 8.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.442
There's still four hours of tape.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.680
Once you have all the pictures,
where're you going?

24:36.709 --> 24:39.690
We'll start at the Botanical Gardens
where the body was dumped.

24:39.712 --> 24:43.125
Goren: Then the jewelry store
where Charlotte Fielding worked.

24:48.587 --> 24:49.930
His first name is Gerry.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.128
He might've been in the company of this woman.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.998
Wait. Here, this guy. I've seen him here.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.872
- When?
- A bunch of times.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.468
- He sits right over there.
- Oh, yeah right, that's him.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.106
He comes in here almost once a week.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.912
- The weekends?
- No, during the week. Different days.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.078
When's the last time?

25:09.108 --> 25:11.611
It's been at least a couple of weeks for sure.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.623
He spends whole days here.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.285
Usually brings a sandwich.
He reads the paper or a book.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.795
Yeah. Sometimes he sits
in the greenhouse, snoozing.

25:18.817 --> 25:21.354
- You ever talk to him?
- Just to say hello, that's all.

25:21.387 --> 25:25.233
- He's not a talker.
- I heard him talking to himself once,
out by the rose garden.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.258
Saying what?

25:27.659 --> 25:30.299
I don't know, he sounded pissed off.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.673
One time I heard him say it wasn't his fault.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.837
He said that a few times.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.777
You know how he gets here? A Bus, car?

25:38.804 --> 25:41.148
Car. I've seen him out in the parking lot.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.346
Silver Volvo. Had a few years on it.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.355
License plate?

25:45.377 --> 25:48.256
- No, sorry.
- All right, thanks.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.823
My witnesses did better than yours.

25:52.851 --> 25:56.492
Jersey plates, last two numbers are 3-5.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.798
Looks like the closest Gerry's been to Kenya

25:58.824 --> 26:01.031
are the African violets in the greenhouse.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.301
Girl: Keep on going.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.070
Boy: A little bit to the right.
Yeah, there we go.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.772
- Watch out for the log!
- I hope someone's navigating her.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.611
- Boy: Now to the left. Left.
- You're making me nervous.

26:11.637 --> 26:14.117
Okay. Right. Getting warm.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.982
Getting very warm.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.988
Boy: You can look now!

26:19.144 --> 26:20.851
I love it. What is it?

26:20.879 --> 26:22.187
It's a wall of remembrance,

26:22.214 --> 26:23.955
of all the great things you've done.

26:23.982 --> 26:27.122
Here's where you carried me home
from the hospital in the snowstorm,

26:27.152 --> 26:28.187
when I was a baby.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.064
That's where you saved my cat
when it was up on the roof.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.570
And that's you and Papa duck hunting.

26:33.592 --> 26:37.369
And that's you flying around
the world and helping people.

26:37.396 --> 26:40.639
The kids have been working on it for a month.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.771
Happy Birthday, sweetie.

26:44.837 --> 26:48.683
Gerry: I don't think any father
ever had a better birthday.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.654
Okay, time for cake.

26:52.678 --> 26:54.680
Children: Yes!

26:56.849 --> 26:58.851
Those kids just adore you.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.761
I'm very proud of you, son.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.256
Listen, I'm thinking of taking your
mother on a cruise this summer,

27:04.289 --> 27:06.166
but I have to book it now.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.172
I'm going to need some
money out of our savings.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.270
- How much?
- $10,000 should do it.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.040
I don't know, Dad, isn't a
cruise a little risky?

27:16.068 --> 27:17.945
Ah, it'll be fun.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.450
Your mother and I haven't been away for years.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.884
I'll need the check by the end of the week.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.480
Okay. I'll have the bank wire it.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.420
Here's hoping for another
satisfied Volvo owner.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.429
- Tessa Rankin?
- Yes?

28:06.451 --> 28:08.260
We're from the New York City Police.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.097
We're investigating
an accident in the city last week.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.830
Do you own a silver Volvo,

28:12.858 --> 28:16.396
license plate number EVZ 135?

28:16.428 --> 28:19.841
I think that's ours, but I didn't
notice any damage to our car.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.108
The person driving might've
witnessed the accident.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.944
Well, my husband uses the car.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.109
He works in the city. He has an office there.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.449
If you leave me your card, I can ask him.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.454
Be better if we asked him.

28:31.476 --> 28:34.389
- Where does he work?
- At the United Nations.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.791
In the Office of Economic Development.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.795
He's an economist.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.797
What's his name?

28:40.819 --> 28:42.423
Gerald Rankin.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.400
Yes, I think I might've heard of him.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.630
That wouldn't be surprising.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.969
Do you know where specifically
he has his office in the UN building?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.975
Well, no, I don't know what floor.

28:51.997 --> 28:54.307
I've never been there.
It's a high security area.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.280
Could we have his office number?
Maybe we can find him that way.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.782
It just goes to his voice mail.

28:59.805 --> 29:03.252
- He's always in meetings.
- What about his secretary?

29:03.275 --> 29:05.915
Gerry doesn't have one. He doesn't trust them.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.584
I just leave a message
and he always calls me right back.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.594
That's a good system.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.721
You do that when he travels overseas?

29:12.751 --> 29:15.425
Yes. Those foreign hotels are unreliable.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.058
They don't always speak English.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.036
- You got that right.
- ( chimes ring )

29:20.959 --> 29:22.961
We'll call him. Thank you.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.169
Gerry: What exactly did they say?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.841
Just that there was
some kind of car accident.

29:31.870 --> 29:35.374
- You didn't tell me.
- There's dozens of silver Volvos
with Jersey plates.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.886
They got the numbers mixed up.

29:36.908 --> 29:40.117
- I'll look into it when I get home.
- When's that going to be? I miss you.

29:40.145 --> 29:43.285
I have to get the money for Mom
and Dad's cruise, then pick up the kids.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.522
No, you don't have to do that. Just come home.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.496
I'll pick 'em up.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.999
And we'll all come home.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.834
I'll see you soon.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.491
The UN doesn't have a Gerald Rankin
working for any of it agencies.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.661
The phone number's for a cell phone
registered under the wife's name.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.364
The bills go to a PO box.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.373
He did go to Columbia for eight years
as an Economics major,

30:30.395 --> 30:31.567
but he never graduated.

30:31.596 --> 30:36.011
The state tax office says he hasn't
reported any income for the last 16 years.

30:36.034 --> 30:40.005
He has no bank accounts,
no credit cards, no gas cards.

30:40.038 --> 30:43.349
Nothing but the footprints in the snow.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.015
Hard to believe the guy's never
popped up on our radar.

30:46.044 --> 30:50.857
Three years ago he testified
at a Medical Examiner's inquest
into his father-in-law's death.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.021
Slip-and-fall following a heart attack.

30:53.051 --> 30:56.863
- Carver: Yes, I'm still here.
- Gerry was alone in the house
with the old man.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.368
- They're faxing us the final report.
- Carver: Good to hear.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.268
The Essex County DA

31:01.293 --> 31:04.570
will issue their own material
witness warrant for Mr. Rankin.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.304
And they'll post officers to watch his house.

31:07.332 --> 31:10.973
However humble his lifestyle,
how did Mr. Rankin

31:11.002 --> 31:14.040
manage to support his family for 16 years?

31:14.072 --> 31:16.109
Frank Caspari's $400 grand's a good start.

31:16.141 --> 31:19.645
Here's something. According to
the county clerk in Essex,

31:19.678 --> 31:22.659
his father and his father-in-law

31:22.681 --> 31:25.218
gave Gerry limited power
of attorney 10 years ago.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.991
Limited to what?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.828
Money transfers, purchase of
securities and real estate.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.266
That's interesting.

31:31.289 --> 31:34.202
So he makes up all these tall tales
just to swindle people?

31:34.226 --> 31:36.729
Well, I haven't figured the guy out yet.

31:36.762 --> 31:39.572
Medical report on the
father-in-law's slip-and-fall.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.408
Right here, in the bruise under the right arm.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.914
Those two marks, what are they?

31:48.673 --> 31:50.175
( knocking )

31:50.208 --> 31:52.017
Eames: We're back,

31:52.043 --> 31:54.023
this time with a search warrant.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.854
You can't just come into my house.

31:55.881 --> 31:59.055
I'm sorry, ma'am, just read the warrant.
Brayder. Morelli.

32:01.987 --> 32:04.695
Mrs. Rankin? Mrs. Rankin?

32:04.723 --> 32:06.293
It'll be all right.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.304
If we could just sit over here.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.972
Have you spoken to your husband
since we were here?

32:12.998 --> 32:14.978
Yes, why?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.310
Did he say where he was, where he was going?

32:17.335 --> 32:19.975
He was stopping to get money for his father,

32:20.005 --> 32:22.645
and then he was picking up
the kids and coming home.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.120
He was lending his father some money?

32:25.143 --> 32:28.317
No, it's for a cruise.
Gerry manages their savings.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.587
Is that what this is all about?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.653
Gerry said it was all legal.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.824
What is?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.669
Because of his work at the UN,

32:39.691 --> 32:42.331
Gerry's able to put money in a Swiss bank

32:42.360 --> 32:44.135
at a very high rate of interest.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.642
Does he do that for a lot of people?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.508
He invested my father's savings,

32:48.533 --> 32:50.137
till Dad died three years ago.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.172
That money's for our kids now.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.915
Before he died,

32:57.943 --> 33:00.947
was your father planning
on taking some of the money out?

33:00.979 --> 33:04.483
He was talking about getting
a cottage by the shore.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.294
If Gerry did something wrong
by putting money in that bank,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.300
I'm sure he didn't know.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.302
He was just trying to help the family.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.497
That's the most important thing for him.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.701
Oh, the children made that for his birthday.

33:26.404 --> 33:28.475
It's got his whole life up here.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.147
Bringing the baby home from the hospital...

33:31.176 --> 33:32.678
Columbia.

33:32.711 --> 33:36.591
Gerry was the first one in his family
to graduate from college.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.356
The kids think the world of him.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.529
He must feel very loved.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.367
He must feel very loved.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.547
Your kids, how did they get to school today?

34:00.572 --> 34:03.052
Gerry decided to drive them.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.782
Mrs. Rankin, I need you to call the school

34:05.810 --> 34:07.016
and ask about your kids.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.492
- Why? They're in class.
- Please call the school.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.632
Hello. Hi, this is Tessa Rankin.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.768
I'm calling about my children
Jason and Natalia?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.402
Oh.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.108
Right.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.012
He said what?

34:37.509 --> 34:39.351
Thank you.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.652
Gerry called them... already this morning,

34:44.683 --> 34:46.822
and he told them the children had the flu

34:46.851 --> 34:48.762
and they were staying home from school.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.097
But they must have misunderstood.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.338
Oh God, my children.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.840
What's happening? What's wrong with Gerry?!

34:57.862 --> 34:59.864
What matters are your kids.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.114
You need to call Gerry.

35:05.136 --> 35:09.642
When he calls back, you need
to find out for us where he is.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.416
Okay? You can't tell him that we're here.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.317
Look, you have to ask about your kids.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.489
You have to make sure you call them by name.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.466
Mrs. Rankin...

35:23.488 --> 35:26.492
He can't know you suspect anything's wrong.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.638
( cell phone ringing )

35:44.342 --> 35:46.049
Yes, sweetheart?

35:46.077 --> 35:48.023
Hi, honey.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.993
I just called to see when you think
you'll be coming home.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.496
Gerry: I don't know.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.293
Well, the school called.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.460
Are Jason and Natalia with you?

36:01.292 --> 36:03.602
- Yes, they're here.
- Can I say hi?

36:03.628 --> 36:07.235
Um, no. They're sleeping now.

36:07.265 --> 36:10.769
This early? Are they sick?

36:10.802 --> 36:12.645
No, we had a big day. We went skating

36:12.671 --> 36:14.947
and we went swimming downstairs.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.681
They were so tired, they
fell asleep in the room.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.680
Well, where are you? Maybe I can come over.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.659
No, I don't think so.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.625
Well, then just come home, honey.

36:26.651 --> 36:29.257
I have dinner waiting for you
and Jason and Natalia.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.198
They're very tired.

36:31.222 --> 36:33.202
I'm sorry, I have to get off the phone.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.397
I won't be able to talk to you anymore.

36:35.427 --> 36:39.170
No, Gerry, wait. Gerry,
please, for God's sakes!

36:41.599 --> 36:43.237
He won't let me talk to them.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.975
Did he say where he was?

36:45.003 --> 36:48.951
It's some kind of hotel, it had a pool.
He seemed to know it.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.954
Probably the place he stays when
he's supposed to be out of town.

36:51.976 --> 36:56.220
Did he ever bring any souvenirs
from a hotel, soap or...?

36:56.247 --> 36:58.818
The little shampoo bottles.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.922
Natalia uses them on her dolls.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.626
The Paris Park Suites.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.761
It's by the Newark Airport.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.965
Get your husband back on the phone.
Keep him talking as long as you can.

37:09.994 --> 37:12.406
If he hangs up, call him back.

37:13.431 --> 37:17.743
They can set up a sniper team, but under
no circumstance should they rush this guy!

37:17.769 --> 37:19.874
They need to keep their distance!

37:21.439 --> 37:24.010
Lauren, get me the Jersey
troopers in Union County.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.113
There's a... what's-his-name?

37:26.144 --> 37:28.886
Blundell, Captain Blundell.
Tell him Jimmy Deakins is calling.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.656
Try him again.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.632
( cell phone ringing )

37:44.129 --> 37:46.370
(airplane roars overhead)

38:09.954 --> 38:11.956
Goren: Gerry? Gerry Rankin?

38:13.458 --> 38:15.631
The maid gave me a pass key.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.938
I'm Robert Goren.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.965
Go away.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.744
I just want us to talk.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.617
I'm going to...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.313
I'm going to stand right here,

38:30.341 --> 38:32.321
like this.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.523
I've learned a lot about you, Gerry.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.655
About the events that brought you here.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.903
How you've been caught up in the...

38:48.927 --> 38:50.668
tentacles of circumstance.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.835
Everything has been done to you.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.150
None of it has been your fault.

39:04.275 --> 39:07.119
Like when you were at Columbia,

39:07.145 --> 39:09.216
you missed your finals--

39:09.247 --> 39:11.124
you were tired, you were sick,

39:11.149 --> 39:13.857
or maybe you just didn't want
to be an economist after all.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.429
It was too late.

39:17.455 --> 39:21.096
You were carrying the burden
of your parents' expectations.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.867
You couldn't disappoint them.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.704
So you lied to them about graduating.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.903
It wasn't your fault. You did it for them.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.974
Right?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.983
I didn't have any choice.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.548
For them and for Tessa...

39:41.579 --> 39:45.083
Who has all her hopes pinned on you.

39:45.116 --> 39:49.121
You had to invent a life for all of them.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.863
The pressure of that must've been...

39:52.891 --> 39:54.666
Unbearable.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.906
And then your father-in-law,

39:57.929 --> 40:01.138
if he hadn't wanted to buy
that stupid little cottage!

40:01.165 --> 40:03.304
You had responsibilities!

40:03.334 --> 40:05.314
You had to do something to stop him!

40:05.336 --> 40:07.179
It wasn't your fault!

40:09.173 --> 40:12.643
And then Charlotte and her crooked brother.

40:12.677 --> 40:15.317
If he hadn't wanted to come after that money,

40:15.346 --> 40:17.519
if he hadn't forced you to--

40:17.548 --> 40:20.995
to make these... tough decisions,

40:22.320 --> 40:26.063
like having a relationship with Charlotte,
like breaking your marriage vows.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.003
I mean, you were pushed
into it by circumstance.

40:29.027 --> 40:32.839
You shut up! You don't know anything about me!

40:34.032 --> 40:36.638
- Gerry--
- No, you don't know!

40:36.668 --> 40:38.739
Just get out of here! I'm going to do this!

40:38.770 --> 40:40.579
- Now get out!
- Oh, of course!

40:40.605 --> 40:42.778
Of course you didn't break your vows!

40:42.807 --> 40:46.016
Of course you didn't sleep
with Charlotte Fielding!

40:47.712 --> 40:49.692
Of course! My God, Gerry.

40:49.714 --> 40:52.194
The one time that you had a choice to make,

40:52.216 --> 40:54.662
you chose the moral thing,

40:54.686 --> 40:57.257
no matter the sacrifices
that you had to make!

40:57.288 --> 40:59.700
No matter how alone that you felt,

40:59.724 --> 41:02.170
you didn't give in to temptation.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.042
You're a hero, Gerry.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.809
You did what heroes do.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.009
You played the hand that you were dealt...

41:18.843 --> 41:22.757
Because you wanted the best for your family.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.657
Because you wanted
to spare them the disappointment,

41:29.687 --> 41:32.793
especially these two precious children.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.544
The thought of them...

41:50.708 --> 41:54.178
Looking at you with anything less
than admiration

41:54.212 --> 41:56.214
would be too much to bear.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.218
But now, Gerry, now...

42:02.487 --> 42:04.660
They're able to--

42:04.689 --> 42:07.033
to take the true measure...

42:08.726 --> 42:10.728
Of the sacrifices that you've made.

42:14.332 --> 42:17.279
Nothing you've done up to now
has been your fault.

42:17.301 --> 42:19.838
If you do what you're thinking...

42:21.672 --> 42:24.585
That will be your fault. Your choice.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.117
No one will ever forgive you.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.856
No one will ever love you again.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.265
Okay?

42:40.691 --> 42:42.466
- So just let go.
- (sobbing)

42:46.497 --> 42:49.273
- Clear!
- Get down!

42:49.300 --> 42:51.541
Down! Get him down! Get him down!

42:51.569 --> 42:54.550
Let me see your hands behind your back. Now!

42:54.572 --> 42:57.519
I didn't hurt them. I would never hurt them.

43:04.015 --> 43:05.323
(sighs)

43:14.659 --> 43:18.300
Only two shells. One for each child.

43:18.329 --> 43:20.138
He was planning to walk away.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.312
Charlotte Fielding's lucky.

43:23.334 --> 43:27.009
She'll never know what a worm
her white knight turned out to be.
