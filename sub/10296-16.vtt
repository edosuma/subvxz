that shopping list?

01:31.567 --> 01:35.367
Bread, milk, juice, eggs,

01:35.367 --> 01:36.968
That's what we forgot.

We forgot to do
the grocery shopping.

Oh, well.

Nice jacket, Mom.

Yeah.

Anyhow, I'm a little late
because I didn't have any cash,

02:36.133 --> 02:37.968
so to pay
for my grilled cheese,

02:37.968 --> 02:40.767
I had to unload lobsters
for two hours.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.934
Nice skateboard, Bud.

Well, Bud needed
a few things for school.

Which class needed a new jacket
for Mommy?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.901
It was just a cheap jacket.

02:51.901 --> 02:53.434
I mean, it hardly cost anything.

02:53.434 --> 02:57.767
You're just making a big deal
over nothing.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.200
You know,
I was just out shopping

02:59.200 --> 03:00.734
and I wanted to get

03:00.734 --> 03:02.167
a little something
for everybody.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.667
What did you get for me?

You see, Dad,

03:38.234 --> 03:39.534
sometimes when you order
something in the mail,

03:39.534 --> 03:40.634
your name goes on
a mailing list.

03:40.634 --> 03:42.334
Well, what did Buck
send away for?

03:42.334 --> 03:44.834
Kelly ordered him
a dog collar.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.267
It cost 40 bucks.

Uh, Bud, what is this?

04:00.601 --> 04:02.901
It looks like a new video game
I'm sitting on?

04:02.901 --> 04:06.400
Well, it wasn't as much
as Mom's coat.

04:08.267 --> 04:09.267
Was so.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.467
Oh, yeah? What
about the watch?

to sell more shoes"?

You know, when the truck

04:21.000 --> 04:22.868
was taking me
to the lobster warehouse,

04:22.868 --> 04:25.634
I said...

04:25.634 --> 04:28.434
I said to Sven, "You think
it's all worth it, buddy?"

04:28.434 --> 04:29.701
And Sven said,

04:29.701 --> 04:32.400
"When it's for the family,
it's always worth it."

04:32.400 --> 04:34.501
He also said that
a lobster couldn't pinch

that when they take a buzz saw
to your credit card in public,

"Get lost, deadbeat."

she'd be coming home early.

Well, they've got plenty
of fancy hotels downtown.
