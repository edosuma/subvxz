<b>Shroud</b>

00:03.230 --> 00:04.440
<b><i>Ten</i>.</b>

00:04.440 --> 00:07.790
<b>The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.</b>

00:07.790 --> 00:11.490
<b>You can make your body harder,

00:13.830 --> 00:16.190
<b>A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.</b>

00:16.190 --> 00:17.830
<b>It is effective for concealing your presence,</b>

00:17.830 --> 00:20.010
<b>and recovering from extreme fatigue.</b>

00:20.520 --> 00:29.000
<b>Enhance</b>

00:20.970 --> 00:22.110
<b><i>Ren</i>.</b>

00:22.110 --> 00:25.260
<b>A technique to create an 
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.</b>

00:25.260 --> 00:28.480
<b>This ability is crucial for increasing your power.</b>

00:29.020 --> 00:35.510
<b>Act</b>

00:30.130 --> 00:31.160
<b><i>Hatsu</i>.</b>

00:31.160 --> 00:33.200
<b>The release of your <i>Nen</i> aura,</b>

00:33.200 --> 00:35.510
<b>after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.</b>

00:36.560 --> 00:39.650
<b>These four elements are known 
as the four major principles,</b>

00:38.720 --> 00:44.020
<b>Four Major Principles</b>

00:39.650 --> 00:43.040
<b>and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:09.360 --> 02:11.700
<b>Yes, that truly was impressive.</b>

02:11.990 --> 02:14.220
<b>I can see the progress you've made</b>

02:14.220 --> 02:16.530
<b>from these last two fights.</b>

02:17.050 --> 02:20.630
<b>Feel free to pick a time and place...</b>

02:22.870 --> 02:25.660
<b>I shall be your opponent.</b>

02:29.670 --> 02:34.670
<b>The x True x Pass</b>

02:38.180 --> 02:41.410
<b>Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,</b>

02:41.410 --> 02:45.960
<b>so he continues to train hard in <i>Nen</i> to prepare.</b>

02:48.050 --> 02:51.590
<b>Today, we will finally begin to train in <i>Hatsu</i>.</b>

02:50.210 --> 02:53.810
<b>Act</b>

02:52.160 --> 02:53.810
<b>Once you master <i>Hatsu</i>,</b>

02:53.810 --> 02:56.660
<b>you will have learned the basic <i>Nen</i> principles.</b>

02:57.130 --> 02:59.150
<b>After that, you will need to work</b>

02:59.150 --> 03:01.850
<b>on developing your individual <i>Nen</i> style.</b>

03:01.850 --> 03:03.200
<b>Osu!</b>

03:03.680 --> 03:06.970
<b><i>Hatsu</i> is the technique 
by which you control your <i>Nen</i>.</b>

03:06.970 --> 03:09.430
<b>It is the culmination of <i>Nen</i>,</b>

03:09.430 --> 03:12.210
<b>and there are six distinct categories.</b>

03:12.480 --> 03:16.670
<b>Enhancer</b>

03:13.770 --> 03:17.210
<b>Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.</b>

03:17.230 --> 03:19.970
<b>Emitter</b>

03:18.200 --> 03:20.470
<b>Emitters can propel their aura.</b>

03:20.490 --> 03:23.470
<b>Transmuter</b>

03:21.590 --> 03:23.970
<b>Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.</b>

03:23.990 --> 03:27.260
<b>Conjurer</b>

03:25.220 --> 03:27.720
<b>Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.</b>

03:27.740 --> 03:31.230
<b>Manipulator</b>

03:28.670 --> 03:31.330
<b>Manipulators can use their aura 
to control objects and creatures.</b>

03:31.750 --> 03:39.400
<b>Specialist</b>

03:32.600 --> 03:36.780
<b>Specialists are those with a 
special aura that doesn't fall</b>

03:36.780 --> 03:39.010
<b>within the other five classes.</b>

03:40.450 --> 03:44.780
<b>The key is to find the power that suits you.</b>

03:42.090 --> 04:32.750
<b>Enhancer 
Emitter 
Transmuter 
Conjurer 
Manipulator 
Specialist</b>

03:44.780 --> 03:46.450
<b>The power that suits you?</b>

03:46.450 --> 03:48.670
<b><i>Nen</i> is linked to individual ability,</b>

03:48.670 --> 03:51.580
<b>with two areas of particular prominence.</b>

03:52.570 --> 03:54.810
<b>The first would be your natural potential.</b>

03:54.810 --> 03:58.590
<b>The second would be potential 
refined later in life.</b>

03:59.770 --> 04:01.550
<b>Gon-kun, for example,</b>

04:01.550 --> 04:05.090
<b>was born with a flexible, springy body.</b>

04:06.310 --> 04:11.100
<b>His acute senses were the product 
of a childhood spent in nature.</b>

04:11.930 --> 04:16.360
<b>From the moment of birth, your <i>Nen</i> aura</b>

04:16.360 --> 04:18.700
<b>falls within one of the six categories.</b>

04:19.280 --> 04:22.560
<b>While rare, it is possible for your 
<i>Nen</i> aura to later change types.</b>

04:24.610 --> 04:27.100
<b>If you attempt to learn an ability</b>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.690
<b>that does not fit your inclination,</b>

04:29.690 --> 04:31.730
<b>you will find it very difficult.</b>

04:32.770 --> 04:33.640
<b>Act</b>

04:33.640 --> 05:03.490
<b>Enhancer</b>

04:33.640 --> 05:03.490
<b>Transmuter 
Conjurer</b>

04:33.640 --> 05:03.490
<b>












Specialist</b>

04:33.640 --> 05:03.490
<b>Emitter 
Manipulator</b>

04:35.240 --> 04:37.390
<b>This hexagon depicts the relationship</b>

04:37.390 --> 04:38.800
<b>among the six categories.</b>

04:39.290 --> 04:41.380
<b>The closer a class is to your own,</b>

04:41.380 --> 04:43.000
<b>the higher your compatibility to learn it.</b>

04:43.340 --> 04:44.550
<b>If you are born with an aura</b>

04:44.550 --> 04:45.920
<b>of the Enhancer category,</b>

04:45.920 --> 04:49.160
<b>you will find Enhancer abilities easiest</b>

04:49.160 --> 04:50.500
<b>to learn and master.</b>

04:50.990 --> 04:53.980
<b>And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes</b>

04:53.980 --> 04:56.220
<b>will also be easy to learn.</b>

04:56.220 --> 04:59.820
<b>On the other hand, the Specialist class,</b>

04:59.820 --> 05:02.650
<b>which is furthest away, would be difficult.</b>

05:04.070 --> 05:07.740
<b>To illustrate, I'll use skills 
that you've seen for yourselves.</b>

05:09.160 --> 05:10.760
<b>Hisoka was able to change</b>

05:10.760 --> 05:13.660
<b>his aura into a rubbery substance.</b>

05:13.660 --> 05:15.250
<b>This would be a Transmuter ability.</b>

05:15.940 --> 05:18.580
<b>Gido used his tops and body as 
weapons by making them spin faster,</b>

05:18.580 --> 05:20.500
<b>which would be an Enhancer power.</b>

05:21.620 --> 05:25.350
<b>However, since using so many tops as weapons</b>

05:25.350 --> 05:30.890
<b>also requires Manipulator skill, 
he wasn't as successful.</b>

05:31.790 --> 05:33.660
<b>As for Kastro,</b>

05:33.660 --> 05:36.560
<b>his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.</b>

05:36.560 --> 05:39.650
<b>Had he mastered it, he would have 
been among the strongest <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

05:40.570 --> 05:44.550
<b>I believe that his aura fell 
into the Enhancer class.</b>

05:44.550 --> 05:48.390
<b>However, he focused his energy on 
the power to create a double,</b>

05:48.940 --> 05:50.870
<b>which is a Conjurer skill.</b>

05:51.600 --> 05:55.250
<b>And he also required a Manipulator 
ability to control the double.</b>

05:55.870 --> 05:58.440
<b>Both of those are relatively far</b>

05:58.440 --> 06:00.880
<b>from the Enhancer category.</b>

06:01.420 --> 06:04.900
<b>So neither was compatible 
with an Enhancer type?</b>

06:05.690 --> 06:08.860
<b>Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and</b>

06:08.860 --> 06:11.890
<b>natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.</b>

06:11.890 --> 06:13.440
<b>And as a result,</b>

06:13.440 --> 06:17.950
<b>he squandered most of his <i>Nen</i> potential.</b>

06:17.950 --> 06:20.880
<b>So he made the wrong choice.</b>

06:20.880 --> 06:22.610
<b>He was a great fighter...</b>

06:22.610 --> 06:23.840
<b>It's a shame.</b>

06:24.710 --> 06:25.840
<b>Well?</b>

06:25.840 --> 06:27.930
<b>Do you see the importance</b>

06:27.930 --> 06:31.040
<b>of understanding your own 
auras and inclinations?</b>

06:31.040 --> 06:32.130
<b>Osu!</b>

06:32.130 --> 06:33.280
<b>Given that,</b>

06:33.640 --> 06:38.790
<b>is there any way to learn which 
category your aura falls into?</b>

06:40.290 --> 06:41.540
<b>There is.</b>

06:47.400 --> 06:48.990
<b>Water Divination,</b>

06:48.990 --> 06:52.260
<b>a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.</b>

06:52.620 --> 06:55.180
<b>It's also used in <i>Hatsu</i> training.</b>

06:55.620 --> 06:58.410
<b>You place your hands beside 
the cup, and use <i>Ren</i>.</b>

06:58.800 --> 07:01.690
<b>The result will reveal your category.</b>

07:12.540 --> 07:14.650
<b>The water's overflowing...</b>

07:16.010 --> 07:17.700
<b>If the amount of water changes,</b>

07:17.700 --> 07:19.630
<b>that means you are an Enhancer.</b>

07:19.630 --> 07:24.210
<b>This shows that my aura falls 
within the Enhancer class.</b>

07:24.890 --> 07:27.470
<b>Okay, now it's your turn.</b>

07:38.240 --> 07:40.300
<b>Gon's an Enhancer, too?</b>

07:46.790 --> 07:48.800
<b>The leaf moved!</b>

07:48.800 --> 07:51.670
<b>If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.</b>

07:54.320 --> 07:56.620
<b>Okay, I'm last!</b>

08:07.960 --> 08:09.880
<b>Nothing's happening.</b>

08:09.880 --> 08:11.750
<b>Indeed...</b>

08:11.750 --> 08:13.510
<b>The leaf isn't moving.</b>

08:14.210 --> 08:16.740
<b>Do I not have any potential?</b>

08:16.740 --> 08:17.700
<b>Not at all.</b>

08:17.700 --> 08:19.580
<b>Taste the water.</b>

08:19.580 --> 08:20.770
<b>Taste it?</b>

08:23.870 --> 08:25.850
<b>It might be a little sweet...</b>

08:26.380 --> 08:27.560
<b>You're right.</b>

08:27.560 --> 08:30.020
<b>Yes, it's a bit sweet.</b>

08:30.020 --> 08:32.280
<b>Isn't this just water?</b>

08:32.730 --> 08:34.610
<b>It's just water.</b>

08:34.610 --> 08:36.410
<b>But the taste changed.</b>

08:36.990 --> 08:38.770
<b>Because of Killua-kun's aura.</b>

08:38.770 --> 08:40.100
<b>And that means?</b>

08:40.100 --> 08:41.920
<b>You are a Transmuter.</b>

08:41.920 --> 08:42.870
<b>Oh!</b>

08:43.700 --> 08:45.670
<b>A Transmuter?</b>

08:46.010 --> 08:48.400
<b>Now, you three know</b>

08:48.400 --> 08:50.950
<b>how your auras are classified.</b>

08:51.370 --> 08:52.850
<b>Use the next four weeks</b>

08:52.850 --> 08:56.680
<b>to train hard, so the Water Divination 
results become more pronounced.</b>

08:56.680 --> 08:57.780
<b>Osu!</b>

09:07.210 --> 09:10.190
<b>June 11th</b>

09:15.200 --> 09:18.200
<b>June 16th</b>

<b>This is Gon.</b>

09:40.640 --> 09:43.130
<b>Ah, I have been waiting...</b>

09:43.430 --> 09:46.250
<b>Have you decided when we should fight?</b>

09:46.610 --> 09:48.730
<b>Yeah, July 10th.</b>

09:49.270 --> 09:51.060
<b>That's the day!</b>

09:54.070 --> 09:55.630
<b>Okay.</b>

09:55.630 --> 09:58.150
<b>I can hardly wait...</b>

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
<b>June 22nd</b>

10:19.010 --> 10:22.260
<b>June 30th</b>

10:22.280 --> 10:25.270
<b>July 5th</b>

10:32.580 --> 10:36.360
<b>Now, show me what you've 
accomplished with your training.</b>

10:36.830 --> 10:38.410
<b>Killua-kun, you're first.</b>

10:38.750 --> 10:39.530
<b>Okay.</b>

10:54.030 --> 10:55.050
<b>I'm done.</b>

10:58.800 --> 11:00.140
<b>It's sweet!</b>

11:00.140 --> 11:02.430
<b>Wow, it tastes like honey.</b>

11:03.260 --> 11:04.440
<b>Excellent.</b>

11:04.440 --> 11:05.490
<b>Zushi, you're next.</b>

11:05.490 --> 11:06.470
<b>Osu!</b>

11:25.560 --> 11:27.580
<b>This is the best I can manage...</b>

11:27.900 --> 11:29.150
<b>That's fine.</b>

11:29.150 --> 11:31.830
<b>But it won't be enough to pass.</b>

11:31.830 --> 11:34.440
<b>You'll need to train some more.</b>

11:34.440 --> 11:35.460
<b>Osu.</b>

11:35.460 --> 11:36.790
<b>Gon-kun, you're next.</b>

11:36.790 --> 11:38.090
<b>Osu!</b>

11:52.280 --> 11:53.220
<b>Stop...</b>

11:53.220 --> 11:54.270
<b>Stop, Gon-kun!</b>

11:57.840 --> 12:01.280
<b><i>The water increased with so 
much force, it cracked the glass.</i></b>

12:02.040 --> 12:03.530
<b><i>Honestly...</i></b>

12:04.300 --> 12:05.530
<b>You really are something.</b>

12:06.780 --> 12:08.850
<b>I was feeling pretty good about this.</b>

12:09.310 --> 12:11.210
<b>Gon-kun, Killua-kun.</b>

12:11.880 --> 12:13.920
<b>Today is your graduation day.</b>

12:13.920 --> 12:14.790
<b>Huh?</b>

12:14.790 --> 12:15.710
<b>Really?</b>

12:15.710 --> 12:17.220
<b>We did it, Killua!</b>

12:17.220 --> 12:18.100
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:18.100 --> 12:20.420
<b>Master, what about me?</b>

12:22.060 --> 12:24.430
<b>You still need to train a bit more.</b>

12:25.250 --> 12:26.310
<b>Osu.</b>

12:26.310 --> 12:27.580
<b>Keep at it.</b>

12:27.580 --> 12:29.110
<b>You can do it!</b>

12:29.110 --> 12:29.930
<b>Osu...</b>

12:30.480 --> 12:31.620
<b>And, Gon-kun...</b>

12:31.620 --> 12:32.180
<b>Huh?</b>

12:32.180 --> 12:36.440
<b>I have something important to tell you.</b>

12:36.750 --> 12:38.070
<b>Something important?</b>

12:39.250 --> 12:43.450
<b>Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed 
the Secret Hunter Exam!</b>

12:43.450 --> 12:44.370
<b>Huh?</b>

12:46.990 --> 12:48.720
<b>You've passed.</b>

12:48.720 --> 12:49.700
<b>Congratulations.</b>

12:55.660 --> 12:57.490
<b>The Secret Hunter Exam?</b>

12:57.490 --> 12:58.740
<b>Correct.</b>

12:58.740 --> 13:01.190
<b>You were able to pass.</b>

13:01.190 --> 13:02.340
<b>What do you mean?</b>

13:02.700 --> 13:06.540
<b>You are required to learn <i>Nen</i> 
before becoming a Hunter,</b>

13:07.090 --> 13:11.100
<b>as professional Hunters are 
expected to be exceptionally strong.</b>

13:11.520 --> 13:13.100
<b>One of your basic tasks</b>

13:13.310 --> 13:17.800
<b>as a Hunter will be apprehending 
evil poachers and criminals.</b>

13:18.490 --> 13:22.360
<b>You must be strong enough to fight crime.</b>

13:22.360 --> 13:26.350
<b>However, this power is highly 
destructive when used for wrongdoing.</b>

13:26.970 --> 13:30.490
<b>Revealing the existence of <i>Nen</i> 
during the Exam would be dangerous.</b>

13:30.790 --> 13:31.820
<b>Therefore,</b>

13:31.820 --> 13:35.000
<b>the test is only administered to 
those who pass the public Exam.</b>

13:35.000 --> 13:38.600
<b>Oh, so you were going to teach us,</b>

13:38.600 --> 13:40.850
<b>or at least Gon, all along...</b>

13:40.850 --> 13:41.500
<b>Yes.</b>

13:41.970 --> 13:45.320
<b>I should mention that the 
head Shingen-ryu master</b>

13:45.320 --> 13:47.010
<b>is Chairman Netero.</b>

13:48.030 --> 13:51.090
<b>The master has told me much about you.</b>

13:51.090 --> 13:52.720
<b>That old man...</b>

13:53.150 --> 13:54.140
<b>Killua-kun.</b>

13:55.250 --> 13:57.900
<b>Please take the Hunter Exam again.</b>

13:58.560 --> 14:00.730
<b>You will definitely pass next time.</b>

14:00.730 --> 14:01.520
<b>Huh?</b>

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:03.020 --> 14:05.890
<b>You are more than qualified.</b>

14:05.890 --> 14:07.530
<b>I guarantee it.</b>

14:09.010 --> 14:11.280
<b>Yeah, if I feel up to it.</b>

14:11.760 --> 14:13.160
<b>Hey, Wing-san...</b>

14:13.160 --> 14:16.500
<b>Have you heard anything about 
the others who passed?</b>

14:16.500 --> 14:17.290
<b>Sure.</b>

14:18.520 --> 14:20.290
<b>Hanzo and Kurapika</b>

14:20.290 --> 14:24.420
<b>have learned <i>Nen</i> from other teachers.</b>

14:25.020 --> 14:28.470
<b>Pokkle is struggling with <i>Ren</i>.</b>

14:29.550 --> 14:33.430
<b>Leorio has begun studying for 
the medical school exam.</b>

14:33.920 --> 14:37.830
<b>Hisoka and Illumi already knew <i>Nen</i>,</b>

14:37.830 --> 14:39.560
<b>so they were qualified.</b>

14:39.970 --> 14:42.700
<b>Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.</b>

14:42.700 --> 14:43.740
<b>Yeah.</b>

14:44.530 --> 14:45.820
<b>Now, Gon-kun,</b>

14:46.130 --> 14:48.450
<b>I have one warning for you.</b>

14:48.880 --> 14:51.220
<b>When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,</b>

14:51.220 --> 14:53.200
<b>don't push yourself too hard.</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:54.640
<b>All right?</b>

14:54.640 --> 14:55.570
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

15:02.670 --> 15:06.680
<b>Zushi, you will continue 
training for four more weeks.</b>

15:06.680 --> 15:07.570
<b>Osu...</b>

15:09.930 --> 15:11.730
<b>You should have more confidence.</b>

15:13.690 --> 15:16.220
<b>You are progressing at an incredible pace.</b>

15:16.800 --> 15:19.040
<b>You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.</b>

15:19.040 --> 15:20.820
<b>One in a hundred thousand?</b>

15:20.820 --> 15:22.230
<b>O-Osu!</b>

15:22.550 --> 15:23.980
<b>However,</b>

15:24.370 --> 15:28.740
<b>those two are one-in-ten-million talents.</b>

15:29.330 --> 15:30.430
<b>Osu!</b>

15:31.440 --> 15:34.990
<b><i>That doesn't make me feel any better, master...</i></b>

15:35.600 --> 15:36.440
<b>But...</b>

15:36.920 --> 15:37.870
<b>One day,</b>

15:37.870 --> 15:40.040
<b>I will definitely catch up!</b>

16:07.030 --> 16:08.740
<b>Hello, everyone!</b>

16:08.740 --> 16:12.530
<b>In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.</b>

16:12.530 --> 16:14.970
<b>This is the fight you've all been waiting for.</b>

16:14.970 --> 16:18.040
<b>As you can see, the stands are packed.</b>

16:18.430 --> 16:22.160
<b>The tension in the air before the 
start of this match is almost unreal!</b>

16:22.560 --> 16:23.730
<b>How much longer?</b>

16:23.730 --> 16:25.420
<b>Get this thing started!</b>

16:49.640 --> 16:52.670
<b>Gon is the first to arrive!</b>

16:52.670 --> 16:55.100
<b>After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.</b>

16:55.100 --> 16:56.630
<b>He's on a roll!</b>

16:56.630 --> 16:58.700
<b>You can do it, Gon!</b>

16:58.700 --> 17:00.740
<b>Don't you need your fishing rod?</b>

17:01.050 --> 17:03.210
<b>You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!</b>

17:05.820 --> 17:09.710
<b>And next, with a fiery display...</b>

17:11.270 --> 17:13.080
<b>Hisoka appears!</b>

17:16.910 --> 17:20.260
<b>His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh</b>

17:20.260 --> 17:22.100
<b>in everyone's minds.</b>

17:22.670 --> 17:24.310
<b>His record is 9-3.</b>

17:24.310 --> 17:25.800
<b>If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.</b>

17:25.800 --> 17:28.110
<b>If he loses, he falls all the way down.</b>

17:28.520 --> 17:31.860
<b>However, he has yet to lose 
when he steps into the ring!</b>

17:32.400 --> 17:35.110
<b>Will his undefeated record continue?</b>

17:49.360 --> 17:50.630
<b><i>Oh...</i></b>

17:51.230 --> 17:53.880
<b><i>Don't look at me like that.</i></b>

17:53.900 --> 17:58.390
<b>Schwing</b>

17:54.880 --> 17:57.240
<b><i>I'm getting turned on.</i></b>

18:01.710 --> 18:04.300
<b><i>What a sinister aura.</i></b>

18:04.300 --> 18:06.640
<b><i>Gon-kun, don't overdo it.</i></b>

18:14.600 --> 18:16.900
<b>Points and KO system.</b>

18:17.530 --> 18:19.160
<b>No time limit!</b>

18:19.800 --> 18:21.300
<b>One round!</b>

18:24.520 --> 18:25.660
<b>Begin!</b>

18:27.000 --> 18:28.930
<b>This is the match you've been waiting for.</b>

18:28.930 --> 18:31.670
<b>The die has been cast!</b>

18:32.220 --> 18:34.340
<b>Who will make the first move?</b>

18:35.980 --> 18:37.550
<b>It's Gon!</b>

19:40.950 --> 19:42.170
<b>A clean hit!</b>

19:42.170 --> 19:43.450
<b>One point to Hisoka!</b>

19:46.250 --> 19:48.780
<b>Wh-What an intense exchange.</b>

19:48.780 --> 19:52.210
<b>I never even got to sneak in a word!</b>

19:55.990 --> 19:57.330
<b>What's wrong?</b>

19:57.330 --> 20:00.470
<b>I still haven't moved a step from where I started.</b>

20:00.470 --> 20:02.140
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

20:03.300 --> 20:04.600
<b>Damn!</b>

20:04.600 --> 20:06.100
<b>Just you wait!</b>

20:08.840 --> 20:12.510
<b><i>Okay, I don't have to try to 
hit him with every attack.</i></b>

20:12.510 --> 20:15.110
<b><i>I can use some feints to get the same effect.</i></b>

20:16.870 --> 20:19.610
<b><i>Hisoka's enjoying himself.</i></b>

20:20.460 --> 20:23.610
<b><i>In terms of actual skill, 
there's an insurmountable gap.</i></b>

20:24.440 --> 20:26.120
<b><i>But he still has a weakness.</i></b>

20:26.590 --> 20:29.540
<b><i>Hisoka knows that he's stronger,</i></b>

20:29.540 --> 20:30.620
<b><i>so he won't retreat.</i></b>

20:31.280 --> 20:33.000
<b><i>That gives Gon an opening!</i></b>

20:34.500 --> 20:36.420
<b><i>In that case, I'll try that!</i></b>

20:51.050 --> 20:52.190
<b>There it is!</b>

20:52.190 --> 20:54.190
<b>Gon's Stone Flip!</b>

20:58.390 --> 21:00.690
<b><i>He shattered the block to 
create a hail of rubble.</i></b>

21:02.700 --> 21:03.450
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

21:05.560 --> 21:06.450
<b><i>Where is he?</i></b>

21:38.690 --> 21:42.110
<b>Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.</b>

21:42.110 --> 21:46.060
<b>However, he will soon receive a taste</b>

21:46.060 --> 21:49.530
<b>of Hisoka's true power.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110

<b>The reason Gon and Killua 
began studying <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:11.610 --> 23:13.200
<b>He reels in opponents with rubbery <i>Nen</i></b>

<b>called Bungee Gum,</b>

<b>A peculiar character,

<b>to duplicate other objects.</b>

23:16.790 --> 23:19.460
