WEBVTT

00:04.593 --> 00:07.429
By the pricking of my thumbs,

00:07.596 --> 00:11.725
Something wicked this way comes.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.984
Sorry. Every crook for himself.

00:32.037 --> 00:34.790
Help! Let me out.

00:37.459 --> 00:38.627
Hey, SPideY!

00:38.794 --> 00:41.255
Back in black, huh? I approve.

00:41.838 --> 00:45.008
What? Hey, hey! Hey!

02:06.548 --> 02:09.842
Presume not that I am the thing I was,

02:10.009 --> 02:13.805
For I have turn'd away my former self,

02:15.766 --> 02:17.559
It's happening again.

02:18.977 --> 02:20.145
Stay calm, colonel.

02:20.312 --> 02:23.023
- Slow, deep breaths.
- Deep breaths?

02:23.190 --> 02:24.941
That's all you got? Help him.

02:25.108 --> 02:27.277
My boy's clothes are shrinking
right off him.

02:27.444 --> 02:29.321
Actually, he's getting bigger.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.740
Not that that helps either.

02:35.494 --> 02:38.664
- I got you,Johnny.
- No, Pop, stay back.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.752
No wonder this lab
goes through funding so quickly.

02:48.006 --> 02:50.592
It's okay. Attack's over.

02:50.759 --> 02:53.261
And, hey, I taught that wall
a thing or two.

02:53.428 --> 02:55.764
Are you joking about this?

02:55.931 --> 02:57.683
Too soon, huh?

02:57.849 --> 02:59.768
This should help.

03:00.394 --> 03:04.398
Why don't you try it
on in my office, carefully.

03:12.072 --> 03:13.824
What's happening to my son?

03:13.990 --> 03:17.536
He was exposed to the alien life form
on the hull of his space shuttle.

03:17.703 --> 03:20.872
Colonel Jameson was infected
by the Symb-- The life form?

03:21.039 --> 03:24.042
Actually, he's infected
with microscopic spores...

03:24.209 --> 03:26.545
...that hitched a ride
on the life form.

03:26.712 --> 03:28.630
The way gum sticks to a shoe.

03:28.797 --> 03:30.590
We've been tracking his condition
for months.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.259
Since entering
the colonel's system...

03:32.426 --> 03:35.262
...the spores have multiplied
exponentially.

03:35.429 --> 03:38.473
Dr. Connors thinks they may have
originated on a high-mass...

03:38.640 --> 03:42.853
-...high-gravity world, like Jupiter.
- I don't care if they're from Jersey.

03:43.019 --> 03:45.856
If those sporks aren't out of my son
in 4.2 seconds, I'll--

03:46.022 --> 03:49.818
It's just not that simple.
My gene cleanser had no effect.

03:49.985 --> 03:51.820
Neither did extreme heat or cold.

03:51.987 --> 03:55.490
I've had limited success destroying
individual spores with electricity...

03:55.657 --> 03:58.618
-...but in the meantime--
- I get to wear the fancy suit.

03:59.995 --> 04:01.997
I hear it's all the rage on Jupiter.

04:02.164 --> 04:03.915
You look like a fool superhero!

04:04.082 --> 04:06.251
The spores are chemically
altering your mass...

04:06.418 --> 04:08.253
...making you heavier, stronger.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.090
This Jupiter suit
will slow you down...

04:12.257 --> 04:15.427
...regulate your heartbeat and help you
function in Earth-normal gravity.

04:15.594 --> 04:18.596
Plus the ladies love
a man in uniform.

04:18.764 --> 04:21.349
It's good to maintain
your sense of humour.

04:21.516 --> 04:24.060
Any personality changes
might imply the spores...

04:24.227 --> 04:27.606
...are chemically altering
your mind, as well.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.196
Hey, Sha Shan.

04:34.362 --> 04:35.655
You didn't come to my party.

04:36.656 --> 04:37.741
Why would I?

04:38.283 --> 04:39.743
What...?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.747
You didn't understand.

04:43.914 --> 04:46.666
See, I invited you as my date.

04:48.543 --> 04:50.337
Don't you know who I am?

04:50.504 --> 04:53.340
Only the best quarterback
M-cubed has ever seen.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.300
The reason the Mustangs
won State.

04:55.467 --> 04:59.179
The hero who threw the winning pass
at cost of life and limb...

04:59.346 --> 05:01.723
I know who you are, Flash.
We're in Bio together.

05:01.890 --> 05:03.809
I've never seen you throw a pass.

05:03.975 --> 05:07.270
But I've seen you set off
the sprinklers in the lab, twice.

05:09.773 --> 05:12.818
Fine, walk away.
You think you're all that.

05:12.984 --> 05:16.029
I can date any girl
I want in this crummy school.

05:19.366 --> 05:22.869
Reputation, reputation, reputation!

05:23.036 --> 05:25.789
O, I have lost
my reputation!

05:25.956 --> 05:32.754
I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial.

05:35.757 --> 05:38.677
I have to get to the paper,
but I'll drop you at home first.

05:38.844 --> 05:40.387
You mind if I tag along?

05:40.554 --> 05:42.097
I've got a paycheck waiting
at the <i>Bugle.</i>

05:42.264 --> 05:45.225
Sure, kid, get in.
We can split the fare.

05:48.478 --> 05:52.524
Sorry. Guess that's the sound
of me kissing a normal life goodbye.

05:53.316 --> 05:55.110
<i>Been there, kissed that.</i>

05:55.652 --> 05:57.988
Maybe shutting a door on normal
can open a window on--

05:58.154 --> 06:00.115
What are you babbling about,
Parker? He's infected!

06:01.157 --> 06:03.034
It's not contagious. Eyes front.

06:03.201 --> 06:05.954
I'm just saying,
he's been given great power.

06:06.121 --> 06:08.415
Maybe, great responsi--

06:08.582 --> 06:10.000
What?

06:10.166 --> 06:11.543
What?

06:11.710 --> 06:13.003
What?

06:13.169 --> 06:15.839
Spider-Man's back in black
and on a crime spree.

06:16.006 --> 06:17.424
- What?
- I want everyone on it.

06:17.591 --> 06:19.384
Victim stories, eyewitness accounts.

06:19.551 --> 06:20.552
And a headline:

06:20.719 --> 06:23.221
"Oh, What a Tangled Web
We Weave!"

06:23.388 --> 06:25.599
I've finally got what I need...

06:25.765 --> 06:30.020
...to take the web-head down.

06:30.186 --> 06:32.355
Hold the front page, Robbie.
I'll call you back.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.942
- You can take the web-head down.
- Excuse me?

06:36.109 --> 06:39.029
Look at you, boy.
You got the costume. The powers.

06:39.195 --> 06:41.948
All you need is a hokey name,
Captain Mass.

06:42.115 --> 06:45.702
No, that's too hokey. Strong-Man.
That's too generic.

06:45.869 --> 06:48.955
Sky Colonel... Colonel Jupiter!
That's it!

06:49.122 --> 06:52.208
But, Pop, you hate superheroes.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.378
- When did I say that?
- Every hour, on the hour?

06:55.545 --> 06:59.382
I hate masked heroes.
What are they hiding, anyway?

06:59.549 --> 07:01.259
But you're an astronaut!

07:01.426 --> 07:04.304
The world already knows
and loves you. You love him, right?

07:04.471 --> 07:09.225
Johnny boy, you can be the one
to bring Spider-Man to justice.

07:09.392 --> 07:13.229
- But what if Spidey's innocent?
- Don't confuse the issue.

07:15.148 --> 07:20.070
<i>I can't believe someones posing
as me, framing me, again.</i>

07:20.236 --> 07:23.782
<i>Please be Chameleon.
Please be Chameleon. Please be...</i>

07:31.831 --> 07:33.708
Can you move?
Can you unlock the door?

07:35.251 --> 07:36.378
You again?

07:39.547 --> 07:41.299
Not again. See, I'm the real--

07:45.011 --> 07:47.681
Like looking in a mirror, bro.

07:47.847 --> 07:51.309
The funhouse kind.

07:51.893 --> 07:54.688
Why strew'st thou sugar
on that bottled spider,

07:54.854 --> 07:57.148
Whose deadly web
ensnareth thee about?

07:57.315 --> 07:58.900
Fool, fool!

07:59.067 --> 08:03.154
The day will come to curse
this venomous bunch-back'd toad.

08:05.365 --> 08:09.244
O villain, villain,
smiling cursÃ©d villain!

08:09.411 --> 08:11.371
That one might smile, and smile,

08:11.538 --> 08:13.665
and be a villain,

08:13.832 --> 08:17.127
Go villain!

08:17.293 --> 08:19.421
Yeah!

08:24.551 --> 08:28.388
Bro, it's been too long.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.626
Better call it in, get help.

09:00.003 --> 09:03.256
Wait, I am help.

09:03.423 --> 09:06.176
Come on, Jameson,
you're not seriously thinking about...

09:06.342 --> 09:10.055
...leaping tall buildings
in a single bound?

09:13.475 --> 09:15.769
Colonel Jupiter, away!

09:18.313 --> 09:19.481
So I'm a little confused.

09:19.647 --> 09:21.149
Do you wanna frame me
or squash me?

09:21.733 --> 09:24.152
You make it sound
so complicated.

09:30.867 --> 09:35.538
All we want is to destroy
every single aspect of your life.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.916
Is that so wrong?

09:53.098 --> 09:54.099
Help me!

09:54.307 --> 09:55.683
Over here!

09:56.768 --> 10:00.021
Can I take a pain check?
I have actual human beings to save.

10:00.188 --> 10:01.981
No go, bro.

10:03.108 --> 10:06.152
When we're done,
the whole world will hate you.

10:06.319 --> 10:10.365
Almost as much as we do.

10:15.620 --> 10:21.417
Hi, I'm Colonel Jupiter.
I saw the fire, thought I could help.

10:34.514 --> 10:35.723
Thank you, young man.

10:35.890 --> 10:37.559
- Glad I could help.
- Help!

10:40.353 --> 10:43.148
This way. Stay low. Come on.

10:43.314 --> 10:46.401
That's it, one at a time.
No ticket required.

10:50.947 --> 10:53.074
MQfn!

10:54.492 --> 10:57.620
- Who are you?
- Colonel Jupiter, ma'am.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.831
MQfn!

11:02.208 --> 11:04.002
Happy to be of service.

11:05.879 --> 11:08.673
- Is there anyone in here?
- Get lost!

11:09.632 --> 11:11.509
I'm afraid I can't do that,
Mister...

11:12.218 --> 11:14.679
-...Parrot.
- Get lost! Get lost!

11:14.888 --> 11:17.056
Get lost!

11:30.028 --> 11:31.905
- You good?
- Yeah.

11:32.071 --> 11:35.241
- Enjoying the hero thing?
- Oh, yeah.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.794
You know, we should think
about making this a regular thing.

11:46.961 --> 11:48.504
Half as many Ock arms.

11:48.671 --> 11:51.299
The Sinister Six divided into
the Manageable Threes.

11:51.466 --> 11:52.967
- I could get used to--
- There he is.

11:53.134 --> 11:56.554
Spider-Man made me crash.
The fire's his fault!

11:56.721 --> 11:59.974
Then what, I stopped for a quick
change of clothes? It wasn't me.

12:00.141 --> 12:03.061
I'll help you explain it to the police.

12:03.228 --> 12:05.980
And answer a few easy questions like,
"What's my name"?

12:06.147 --> 12:08.066
- No, thanks.
- It'll be okay.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.359
Don't fight me on this.

12:21.996 --> 12:22.997
Sorry, gotta swing!

12:23.164 --> 12:26.376
But let's do the team-up thing
again sometime.

12:34.217 --> 12:36.219
Petey, have you been smoking?

12:36.386 --> 12:39.806
What? No, I'd never smoke.

12:40.265 --> 12:44.727
<i>I would, however, put my Spidey-suit
on without washing it first.</i>

12:44.894 --> 12:46.854
<i>Gross.</i>

12:50.608 --> 12:52.694
Say something, please.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.447
I'll see you in class.

13:05.039 --> 13:06.791
Sweet.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.464
Do you smell barbecue?

13:16.718 --> 13:18.303
Sha Shan Nguyen.

13:19.595 --> 13:21.639
She's like totally immune
to the Flash.

13:21.806 --> 13:24.434
- Because she's got a brain?
- Exactly!

13:24.600 --> 13:27.103
So you're gonna tell me
how to make her go out with me.

13:27.270 --> 13:28.563
Me? Why me?

13:28.730 --> 13:32.984
Because A, somehow you got Gwen
and Liz to like your scrawny butt...

13:33.151 --> 13:35.403
...and two, if you tell anyone...

13:35.570 --> 13:37.947
...you'll spend the rest of junior year
stuffed in that locker.

13:39.449 --> 13:44.370
I guess you could try taking an interest
in the things she likes.

13:48.082 --> 13:50.501
Drama, huh?

13:51.210 --> 13:53.629
How hard could it be?

13:55.506 --> 13:58.009
'Doubt thou the stars are fire,

13:58.176 --> 14:02.638
Doubt that the sun doth move,
Doubt truth to be a liar,

14:02.805 --> 14:06.559
But never doubt I love.

14:08.936 --> 14:12.815
Such spirit. Such passion.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.944
Now, that's the kind of audition
I like to see.

14:17.111 --> 14:19.030
Thank you, my dear.

14:19.197 --> 14:22.408
The cast list
will be posted tomorrow. Next.

14:22.575 --> 14:25.286
QB1 is ready for his try-out.

14:26.037 --> 14:27.705
You'll have to wait your turn.

14:28.539 --> 14:31.667
Doesn't anybody know who I am?

14:32.543 --> 14:35.088
<i>The strange
web of crime continues...</i>

14:35.254 --> 14:38.257
...as <i>Spider-Man
defaced City Hall...</i>

14:38.424 --> 14:41.803
If Spidey wasn't responsible,
then why did he run?

14:44.514 --> 14:47.141
You're making a big mistake,
web-head!

15:00.530 --> 15:05.576
Stacy, you have one second to explain
why Spider-Menace isn't behind bars.

15:05.743 --> 15:07.495
Pleasure to see you too, Jonah.

15:07.662 --> 15:09.247
Maybe, I can help.

15:09.414 --> 15:11.833
You heard about this
Colonel Jupiter?

15:11.999 --> 15:13.418
You mean your son?

15:13.584 --> 15:16.003
Well, that's beside the point.
What's the point? Here's the point.

15:16.170 --> 15:18.881
He single-handedly rescued
a billion people...

15:19.048 --> 15:21.092
...from a fire covering
90 city blocks.

15:21.259 --> 15:22.427
Deputize him...

15:22.593 --> 15:25.430
...and he'll have the web-head
on a chain gang in 5.1 seconds.

15:25.596 --> 15:27.432
But which web-head, Jonah?

15:27.598 --> 15:29.600
This is a recent security tape.

15:29.767 --> 15:32.019
And this is older footage.

15:32.186 --> 15:35.189
Look, the fighting style,
the suit, the build...

15:35.356 --> 15:38.109
-...they're all different.
- The camera adds ten pounds.

15:38.276 --> 15:40.695
That bug's still terrorizing our city.

15:40.862 --> 15:42.864
This isn't the first time
the <i>Bugle</i> got it wrong...

15:43.030 --> 15:45.241
...when a copycat dressed up
as the web-slinger.

15:45.408 --> 15:49.245
Now, you really wanna embarrass
yourself and your paper, again?

15:51.831 --> 15:53.833
- John?
- You were right about Spider-Man...

15:54.000 --> 15:56.252
...all along, Pop.
But I'll crush him.

15:59.046 --> 16:03.885
Well, see, the cops aren't 110 percent
sure the real Spidey's the problem.

16:04.051 --> 16:07.054
For now, why don't you save
some cats, kiss a couple of babies.

16:07.221 --> 16:08.848
- The city will eat it up.
- No!

16:10.475 --> 16:12.101
Spider-Man's mine!

16:12.268 --> 16:14.395
And I'm gonna stop him,
permanently!

16:14.562 --> 16:17.190
<i>Johnny,Johnny,
that's the sporks talking.</i>

16:17.356 --> 16:22.361
- They're confusing your brain.
- Colonel Jupiter is not confused.

16:27.033 --> 16:30.328
<i>Come on, Venom, where are you?</i>

16:30.495 --> 16:32.371
Spider-Man!

16:35.458 --> 16:37.418
Hey, Colonel!
I'm glad you're here.

16:37.585 --> 16:39.420
I could use a little help--

16:53.184 --> 16:55.811
O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength,

16:55.978 --> 16:59.649
but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.365
Easy, Colonel. Look, I'm sorry
about that little dust-up...

17:07.531 --> 17:09.157
-...after the fire, but--
- Who are you kidding?

17:09.325 --> 17:11.743
You can't trick me
by switching costumes.

17:14.288 --> 17:16.624
There aren't two bugs
in this city shooting webs.

17:16.790 --> 17:19.835
Oh, believe me, I've got my
trademark lawyers working on that--

17:43.234 --> 17:45.319
<i>The spores must have altered
his brain chemistry.</i>

18:16.934 --> 18:20.479
<i>That's it. Doc Connors said
electricity only had limited success...</i>

18:20.646 --> 18:22.023
<i>...destroying the spores...</i>

18:22.189 --> 18:24.442
<i>...but maybe the problem
was limited electricity.</i>

18:24.650 --> 18:28.237
<i>Just need to lure him
to the nearest major source of juice.</i>

18:29.280 --> 18:31.657
Hey, Colonel Stupider!

18:31.824 --> 18:34.619
Is it true you're getting denser
by the minute?

18:40.499 --> 18:42.543
Plan's working.

18:49.925 --> 18:51.719
You can't run forever, web-head.

18:51.886 --> 18:53.721
My least favourite part of the plan.

18:57.516 --> 19:00.519
Now you'll learn the true meaning
of power.

19:00.686 --> 19:03.856
You want power?
Try two million volts.

19:26.462 --> 19:28.130
"I Will be brief:

19:28.297 --> 19:32.259
your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it,

19:32.426 --> 19:34.428
for, to define true madness,

19:34.595 --> 19:37.515
What is't to be nothing else but mad?"

19:37.932 --> 19:40.434
This is supposed to be English?

19:41.060 --> 19:43.646
The spores are completely out
of your son's system.

19:43.813 --> 19:48.442
He should eventually be able
to resume a normal life.

19:51.445 --> 19:54.448
I miss the power. I need it.

19:54.949 --> 19:56.742
I have to get the power back.

19:56.909 --> 20:00.246
Give me back the power.
Give it back.

20:01.455 --> 20:04.583
Must get the power.
Must the power...

20:05.126 --> 20:07.169
I'm gonna get the power.

20:08.462 --> 20:10.589
We'll give you some time alone.

20:12.383 --> 20:14.635
Don't know anyone named Max.

20:14.802 --> 20:17.763
My name's Electro.

20:17.930 --> 20:21.767
- Electro, I tell you!
- Another one of yours?

20:29.734 --> 20:32.319
All right, slowly, no pushing.

20:34.488 --> 20:36.490
Oh, Glory, we're in.

20:36.657 --> 20:38.743
- Thank you, Shakespeare.
- You too, Kenny.

20:38.909 --> 20:42.705
- Tight.
- Harry, you got a lead.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.623
- Congratula--
- Yeah, thanks, just a sec, okay?

20:44.790 --> 20:47.460
Dad? Dad I got the lead
in the play.

20:47.626 --> 20:49.920
Plus, I have a girlfriend now.

20:51.839 --> 20:55.509
Did you just say
you're proud of me?

21:02.099 --> 21:03.517
<i>I have to find Venom.</i>

21:03.684 --> 21:07.813
<i>It's not safe for Gwen
or anyone I care about.</i>

21:07.980 --> 21:10.775
<i>I miss the Colonel already.</i>

21:11.984 --> 21:14.570
Petey, I'm in. I made the cast.

21:16.739 --> 21:18.574
That's great.

21:22.036 --> 21:24.747
Hey, you made it. Cool.

21:24.914 --> 21:27.249
Suppose this means
we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

21:27.416 --> 21:31.337
That seems unlikely.
Since you aren't on the list.

21:31.504 --> 21:32.755
What?

21:32.922 --> 21:38.052
Obviously, the director's incapable
of recognising our natural charisma.

21:41.847 --> 21:43.974
I'm so stuffing Parker in a locker.

21:44.475 --> 21:46.769
This is all Spider-Man's fault.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.438
He destroyed my son.

21:49.605 --> 21:52.566
If I ever get my hands
on that wall-crawler, I'll--

21:53.818 --> 21:56.362
You want the wall-crawler?

21:56.529 --> 21:58.989
- No!
- Then here's a scoop...

21:59.156 --> 22:02.701
...Peter Parker is Spider-Man.
