WEBVTT

00:17.916 --> 00:20.875
So, what exactly <i>is</i> the resistance?

00:20.958 --> 00:22.500
The resistance is a team.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.708
I for one love being part of the team.

00:24.791 --> 00:28.666
Shut the fuck up, Norf!
You're not on the team, Norf!

00:28.750 --> 00:30.583
I hired you on Taskrabbit to wear me,

00:30.666 --> 00:33.916
not to speak or think
or tell us stories about your pet lizards.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.791
Actually, they're crested geckos
named Sam and Diane, and they--

00:37.875 --> 00:39.541
Nobody gives a fuck, Norf!

00:39.625 --> 00:43.250
I kinda wanted
to hear the lizard story, baby.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.875
I bet they end up together.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.500
Love always win.

00:47.583 --> 00:51.125
Shut up! I'm the boss,
you idiots! I'm in total control!

00:51.208 --> 00:53.291
Oh, uh, Norf, scratch my nose, please?

00:53.375 --> 00:54.958
Oh, that's the stuff.

00:55.041 --> 00:58.375
Now, take three dramatic steps
as I use my intense voice.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.666
We are the resistance.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.416
Our mission
is to ding-dang destroy Lovely Corp

01:03.500 --> 01:06.666
to satisfy all
of our own personal vendettas.

01:06.750 --> 01:11.083
They put Jerry
and my donut shop out of business!

01:11.166 --> 01:13.958
They raised me from the dead, yeah,

01:14.041 --> 01:16.875
and then forced me to learn PowerPoint.

01:16.958 --> 01:21.875
Lovely Corp degrades and abuses
people so much that I'm losing work.

01:21.958 --> 01:27.041
It's been weeks since anybody paid me
to turn their stink hole into a sinkhole.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.791
I'm just here to meet Abe Lincoln.

01:33.291 --> 01:35.875
Somebody better fix that gas leak. Anyway.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.541
I want revenge on Lovely Corp

01:37.625 --> 01:41.500
because they irresponsibly developed
the technology that transformed me into--

01:43.875 --> 01:44.791
This again.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.833
Nobody wants to know how I became pants?!

01:47.916 --> 01:51.375
I'd rather hear the lizard story, baby.

01:51.458 --> 01:52.791
Shut up, Norf!

01:52.875 --> 01:54.291
I didn't say anything.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.166
You smiled. Cut that shit out.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.833
AFKAK, the Macho Man
took the liberty of compiling

01:59.916 --> 02:03.208
a meticulously researched dossier
on Charles Lovely.

02:03.291 --> 02:07.791
Yeah, the Macho Man
added unicorn stickers, uh-huh.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.791
Yeah, they help me
forget the constant pain

02:10.875 --> 02:13.291
due to my hellish state of existence.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.000
Oh yeah!

02:15.083 --> 02:18.791
And I've devised a plan
to shut down Lovely Corp once and for all.

02:18.875 --> 02:23.000
We're writing a bunch of negative
online reviews of Lovely Corp products!

02:39.250 --> 02:41.416
-One star. Take that.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.333
-Uh, you just gave them five stars.
-Shit!

02:44.416 --> 02:48.166
Not me, kemosabe.
Camaro Bob don't do digital.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.416
Even the dick pics
I send are analog, baby.

02:56.541 --> 02:57.458
We have a window?

02:57.541 --> 03:01.083
I'm not sure scathing reviews
is the best way to take down Lovely Corp.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.541
You don't like my plan?

03:02.625 --> 03:04.458
Punch him in the face, Norf.

03:04.541 --> 03:07.916
Psych! You're not on the team.
Put your goddamn hand down.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.250
I've got it. What if we kidnap Thester?
He's Lovely's number two.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.416
Which means he must know
all the company's secrets and weaknesses.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.416
Wow. Now, that's a good plan.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.083
Seriously?
I had that exact same idea last week.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.541
I don't pay you to have ideas!
I pay you to do what I say!

03:23.625 --> 03:26.208
I'm the King of the Norf,
and you're just a White Walker.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.791
Now, let's get to work, people.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.000
Why am I suddenly covered in bird shit?

03:32.083 --> 03:35.708
Sorry, baby.
This group text won't go through.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.666
Fitz, this is foosball.

03:46.750 --> 03:47.916
This guy's your goalie.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.125
His name is Pedro, he's a Scorpio,
he likes his carne asada medium-rare,

03:52.208 --> 03:53.916
and he was raised in Ohio.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.583
That explains his fentanyl habit.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.500
You sure I need to know all this
to play foosball?

03:58.583 --> 04:01.333
Fitz, you take this seriously,
or you get the fuck outta here!

04:01.916 --> 04:04.416
Why, God?

04:04.500 --> 04:09.416
Why? Oh, I'm in so much pain!

04:24.416 --> 04:25.500
Christ, Dusty.

04:25.583 --> 04:29.291
I miss the Shamrock Shake too,
but life goes on.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.416
Does it, Randall?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.750
I just found out my dear mama--

04:32.833 --> 04:35.166
Did you tell him
about Pedro's fentanyl habit?

04:35.250 --> 04:37.416
-Dusty! Focus!
-Oh right.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.166
She died!

04:39.250 --> 04:43.666
She died! I'm so sad! Why?

04:43.750 --> 04:48.958
Now, I need to get her blessed corpse
down at the funeral home by five o'clock.

04:49.041 --> 04:52.541
Problem is…
…I can't move her by my little ol' self.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.250
We'd love to help,
but unfortunately, we're, uh… b-busy.

04:56.333 --> 05:00.500
Yeah. That's it.
We-- we're busy, uh, making up, uh…

05:00.583 --> 05:01.416
An excuse.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.833
Yeah, we-- we're making up an excuse
so that we'd, uh…

05:04.916 --> 05:06.625
Uh, don't have to help you…

05:06.708 --> 05:07.750
Move your…

05:07.833 --> 05:09.125
Fat dead mom.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.625
Fat dead mom, right.

05:12.375 --> 05:16.041
Rule 571 of the Brozone is, and I quote,

05:16.125 --> 05:19.250
"Always help a fellow bro
move a dead body."

05:19.333 --> 05:21.958
Rule 571 only applies to hookers.

05:22.041 --> 05:25.541
Well, the joke's on you!
'Cause my mama fucked for money plenty!

05:25.625 --> 05:28.625
Her clients said
half the fun was hunting for her teetee.

05:28.708 --> 05:31.416
Yeah, that was half the fun!

05:31.500 --> 05:34.166
I mean,
uh, that's what I heard.

05:36.625 --> 05:40.250
Shh. Be very, very quiet.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.458
I'm hunting dick pics.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.458
Look at this schedule.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.666
Cutting the ribbon at the Natural
History Museum dinosaur exhibit.

05:52.750 --> 05:56.250
Going on Anderson Cooper to talk
about Paradise's remarkable turnaround.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.291
Delivering the eulogy
at the funeral of the governor's son!

05:59.375 --> 06:04.291
Now, to ensure your reelection,
it's vital that this day go perfectly.

06:04.375 --> 06:05.500
I can take a hint.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.916
I'm taking my anti-crazy-bitch pills.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.875
Whoa! Karen, don't take that!

06:10.958 --> 06:14.125
I think our identical pill cases
got hilariously mixed up.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.250
Impossible. I'm an ultra-successful mayor.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.416
You're a dog.
How would that have happened?

06:19.500 --> 06:24.125
Uh, maybe when the ultra-successful mayor
came over last night to the dog's house,

06:24.208 --> 06:26.625
piss drunk
with a Costco-size jar of Skippy?

06:26.708 --> 06:27.708
Are you sure?

06:27.791 --> 06:30.375
You really put
your illegal drugs in a pill case?

06:30.458 --> 06:33.666
Oh yeah. I'm what you might call
a type A drug addict.

06:33.750 --> 06:38.166
Oh, man. You just took my Monday Molly.
You're gonna be rolling balls soon.

06:40.208 --> 06:44.583
And to reveal the crown jewel
of the Lovely dinosaur collection,

06:44.666 --> 06:48.041
uh, please welcome Mayor Karen Crawford.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.916
What up, fam? Who got that good dick?!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Hump! Hump! Hump! Hump!

07:00.916 --> 07:03.000
Can I kiss you?

07:03.083 --> 07:05.791
-I'm the mama! I'm the mama!

07:05.875 --> 07:07.833
Oh! Yes!

07:07.916 --> 07:12.625
Uh, uh, she's, uh,
fucking the dinosaur, huh.

07:14.708 --> 07:17.750
Don't worry, Mr. Lovely.
I'm perfectly safe.

07:17.833 --> 07:22.083
Remember how Saddam Hussein
had all his bodyguards get plastic surgery

07:22.166 --> 07:24.458
to look just like Saddam Hussein?

07:24.541 --> 07:28.083
Let's just say I borrowed that idea.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.833
Eat pants, motherfucker!

07:34.541 --> 07:37.875
Ever think it's weird that we got
massive amounts of plastic surgery

07:37.958 --> 07:42.208
to look like Saddam Hussein to protect
someone who ain't Saddam Hussein?

07:42.291 --> 07:44.041
It's a living, Robby.

07:50.916 --> 07:51.958
Oh no!

07:52.875 --> 07:55.000
Do not help, Norf! You're not on the team!

07:55.875 --> 07:57.083
-Ah!

07:57.708 --> 07:58.833
You fucked up.

08:05.916 --> 08:08.791
I think my spine is snapping!

08:08.875 --> 08:11.750
Hey, Dusty.
You gonna fucking help?

08:11.833 --> 08:13.958
I would, but I'm too sad.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.500
It's just like moving a couch.
Twist her clockwise.

08:22.583 --> 08:23.625
Like this?

08:23.708 --> 08:26.541
No! You know
how goddamn clocks work, right?

08:26.625 --> 08:29.125
I never learned! I'm just gonna push!

08:29.208 --> 08:32.500
No! No--
You mashed my fingers!

08:32.583 --> 08:35.333
Don't y'all scratch her now.
I want an open casket.

08:35.416 --> 08:38.291
My hands are numb! I'm pushing!

08:38.375 --> 08:39.583
No, no, no!

08:41.958 --> 08:46.458
Oh, I found her teetee.
I found her teetee.

08:50.541 --> 08:52.708
How dare you ruin my original stitching!

08:52.791 --> 08:54.208
Norf, get in position!

08:57.416 --> 09:00.333
Listen up, you bouncing bag
of bing-bong British bullshit.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.791
We can do this the easy way, or--

09:02.875 --> 09:06.875
Not the easy way! No!
I'll tell you everything!

09:07.583 --> 09:09.708
I never told anyone this, but…

09:09.791 --> 09:12.916
…I secretly star
in a CBS drama about a cop

09:13.000 --> 09:15.125
who works undercover at a deli.

09:15.208 --> 09:18.666
Cole's Law<i>.</i>
<i>Where the cases are colder than the cuts.</i>

09:18.750 --> 09:20.833
Tell us about Lovely Corp!

09:20.916 --> 09:23.083
How can we bring it down once and for all?

09:23.166 --> 09:24.958
You can't! It's impossible!

09:25.041 --> 09:28.291
Lovely Corp is completely indestructible!

09:28.375 --> 09:29.875
We're fucked, baby.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.666
With the exception
of one load-bearing support beam

09:34.750 --> 09:36.625
which, for some implausible reason,

09:36.708 --> 09:39.166
supports the entire weight
of the building.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.208
We're not fucked, baby.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.458
But you won't be able to get to it.

09:44.541 --> 09:49.416
The building is patrolled 24-7
by machine-gun-toting security guards.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.875
Fucked, baby.

09:51.666 --> 09:54.208
With the exception of Sunday

09:54.291 --> 09:58.333
when everyone, including the guards,
are going to Charles' and Gina's wedding,

09:58.416 --> 10:01.083
and the building will be left
completely unattended.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.000
All you'd have to do
is open one unlocked door

10:04.083 --> 10:06.375
and gently push on the support beam.

10:06.458 --> 10:09.500
Lovely Corp would literally
come tumbling down.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.333
Good thing I studied art restoration.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.500
Gina's marrying
Charles Lovely this Sunday?

10:16.583 --> 10:18.541
W-We-- we need to stop the wedding!

10:18.625 --> 10:22.250
Uh, shouldn't we take advantage
of everyone being at the wedding

10:22.333 --> 10:25.583
and sneak into Lovely Corp
and take it down once and for all?

10:25.666 --> 10:27.708
Shut your fucking mouth, Norf!

10:27.791 --> 10:30.333
Uh, shouldn't we take advantage
of everyone being at the wedding

10:30.416 --> 10:33.041
to sneak into Lovely Corp
and take it down once and for all?

10:33.125 --> 10:34.708
You're right, Agent Clappers.

10:34.791 --> 10:37.375
I was being selfish.
That's the perfect plan.

10:37.458 --> 10:41.541
So! You're the star of <i>Cole's Law</i>!

10:41.625 --> 10:45.416
I didn't realize
you were that Thester Carbomb IV.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.666
Just between us,

10:46.750 --> 10:51.375
I am also secretly the star
of a deli-based CBS drama, heh.

10:51.458 --> 10:54.625
<i>He's a hard-nosed reporter</i>
<i>undercover at a deli.</i>

10:54.708 --> 10:57.958
Matzo Ball Scoop<i>! This fall on CBS.</i>

10:58.791 --> 11:02.666
Raise your hand if you're secretly
starring in a deli-based CBS drama.

11:08.791 --> 11:12.583
Whoo-hoo! I wanna blow
some college Republicans!

11:12.666 --> 11:15.666
Dole-Kemp forever!

11:15.750 --> 11:19.833
Bullet! She is supposed to be
on Anderson Cooper in ten minutes!

11:19.916 --> 11:21.291
You've got to fix this!

11:21.375 --> 11:24.375
Relax. I got just the thing
to level her off.

11:25.416 --> 11:28.333
My next guest is here
to talk about how she's fighting

11:28.416 --> 11:30.416
against drug abuse in her town.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.625
I'm now joined
by Mayor Karen Craw--

11:33.708 --> 11:35.541
So… Wow.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.375
Uh, tell us
about Paradise's new civic model.

11:42.166 --> 11:47.375
I am the one true devil,
the dark master of the demon phallus!

11:47.458 --> 11:50.041
Mayor, you seem to be a little distracted.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.666
By your own fingers.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.500
Which you now seem to be eating.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.333
Oh God, no.

11:55.416 --> 11:59.541
Whorey host <i>manos</i>,
you shall enslave me no longer!

11:59.625 --> 12:03.166
Uh, to continue
our Women in Politics segment,

12:03.250 --> 12:05.250
my next guest, Nancy Pelosi.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.250
Oh, that's skunky.

12:10.916 --> 12:13.291
Now, don't move, Dusty.
You're the counterweight.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.791
McDonald's!

12:14.875 --> 12:16.708
Shamrock Shake!

12:16.791 --> 12:17.916
It's October.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Not in Ireland, dumbass!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.458
Shit! Shit! Shit!

12:26.750 --> 12:28.916
Almost there!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.000
And now it's worse.

12:35.583 --> 12:40.833
Uh, see? See? I told you,
I, uh, know a lot about dinosaurs, uh.

12:43.416 --> 12:44.833
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

12:44.916 --> 12:48.166
Yes, see, that--
now, that's the chaos theory.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.166
Run, kids! Run!

12:55.250 --> 12:57.166
Ha! Got my Shamrock Shake!

12:57.250 --> 12:59.666
They'll make you one
if you point a gun at 'em.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.666
Where's Mama?

13:03.750 --> 13:07.250
Thanks to these babies,
this house ain't the only thing that's up.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.875
I wanna go home!

13:08.958 --> 13:10.208
Gah, shut up!

13:19.375 --> 13:21.416
Why would Gina marry this wacko?

13:21.500 --> 13:24.958
"Another beautiful woman
falls for Charles Lovely."

13:25.041 --> 13:28.416
Excuse me, Baby Kevin.
Let the grown-ups handle this.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.125
"Anoh-ther…

13:30.208 --> 13:32.375
be-- boo-- ootiful…

13:32.458 --> 13:34.166
wa-- waoman…"

13:34.250 --> 13:37.416
Here's another one.
And another one.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.916
Oh my God. They're all dead!

13:40.000 --> 13:43.166
Christ! This guy's caused
more irreparable harm to women

13:43.250 --> 13:44.375
than Andy Cohen!

13:44.458 --> 13:46.250
You think he killed all his wives?

13:46.333 --> 13:47.416
And look at this.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.208
What do all these women have in common?

13:51.333 --> 13:52.208
Boobies?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.500
Good eye, bud. You see anything else?

13:55.750 --> 13:58.250
-Beavers?
-They all look like Gina!

13:58.333 --> 14:02.500
And they're all wearing the exact
same locket she's wearing right now.

14:02.583 --> 14:05.500
Lovely must use that
to control their minds.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.333
How else could that freakwad
score such grade-A ass?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.458
Oh no. What should I do?

14:11.541 --> 14:12.750
You gotta save her, bro.

14:12.833 --> 14:16.500
Before your little girlfriend
winds up dead like all the rest.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.875
You're right. Thanks for the favor,
little brother. How could I repay you?

14:19.958 --> 14:22.208
Hide me from Mom! Quick! She's coming!

14:23.916 --> 14:26.750
Baby Kevin? Where are you?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.916
It's time
for your bedtime story!

14:33.458 --> 14:35.541
Whoa. When did Mom turn into Ellen?

14:39.666 --> 14:44.250
Look what you did! She is almost
as bad as Marjorie Taylor Greene!

14:44.833 --> 14:45.750
Fucking lightweight.

14:45.833 --> 14:50.000
I actually have the perfect thing
to bring her down. Bath salts.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Bath salts that I was going to suggest
she dissolve in a nice, warm tub,

14:56.083 --> 14:57.958
but, uh, happy to see how this goes.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.333
Why? What happens when you eat bath salts?

15:02.416 --> 15:05.541
And now to say a few words
honoring my boy,

15:05.625 --> 15:08.208
the mayor of Paradise, Karen Craw--

15:16.375 --> 15:17.291
Two, three…

15:22.958 --> 15:25.958
See? That's what happens
when you eat bath salts.

15:26.958 --> 15:31.333
That was the most beautiful eulogy
anyone has ever given.

15:31.416 --> 15:35.208
How did you know that "Cotton-Eyed Joe"
was my son's favorite song,

15:35.291 --> 15:38.333
or that his lifelong dream
was to have blood vomited on him

15:38.416 --> 15:40.708
by a half-naked elected official?

15:40.791 --> 15:43.625
Shoo! Well, all's well that ends--

15:45.041 --> 15:47.958
Oh yeah. That's also what happens
when you eat bath salts.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.708
Where'd they take Mama?

15:52.791 --> 15:54.375
Scram, you turkeys.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.250
A UFO landed here, and we've taken it
to our top secret hidden government lab

15:58.333 --> 16:00.750
that no civilian can ever find out about.

16:00.833 --> 16:01.958
Is that it?

16:02.041 --> 16:03.666
Why, yes, it is. Damn it!

16:03.750 --> 16:05.833
I'm sorry, Dusty,
we did everything we could.

16:05.916 --> 16:09.791
But we can't sneak into a top secret
hidden government lab.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.125
I hear you, Randall.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.625
And I certainly respect your concerns,
but…

16:23.333 --> 16:25.791
Hold on a second.
Where do you think you're going?

16:25.875 --> 16:30.208
Oh, we're, uh, just, uh, escorting
this alien into the, uh, alien place.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.875
I'm an alien! I'm an alien!

16:32.958 --> 16:36.250
Oh, come on. You expect me
to believe that this dipshit is an alien?

16:36.333 --> 16:38.583
Whoa! What the hell
is the matter with you?

16:38.666 --> 16:40.833
Did you not hear
that thing say it's an alien?

16:40.916 --> 16:41.916
Yeah, but--

16:42.000 --> 16:45.541
No buts. That's what aliens say.
"I'm an alien. I'm an alien."

16:45.625 --> 16:47.583
It just seemed
a little suspicious, is all.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.125
Strike two, Barry. Strike two.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.000
Gentlemen, Mr. Alien,
sorry to waste your time.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.250
Hey, Randall. I think I found her.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.458
Dusty, let me out! Let me out!

17:09.541 --> 17:10.791
Quit fucking around!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.875
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.666
Hoo. I needed this.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.208
You know, it's the first time
I've had a chuckle since Mama died.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.625
Speaking of…

17:25.708 --> 17:26.708
There she is!

17:26.791 --> 17:30.250
Giddyap, Fitz! If we leave now,
we can make it to the funeral in time.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.833
What about Randall?!

17:31.916 --> 17:35.583
Aw. Fine. Let him out, party pooper.

17:39.666 --> 17:41.541
-I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.250
Goop! This is gonna be good!

17:43.333 --> 17:45.708
It's such a blessing
to be able to laugh again.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.291
Almost there.
It's the next building on the right.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.708
Just a little further.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.666
Okay! You can squeeze her ass
right into that booth.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.583
Booth? Wait a minute.

18:02.666 --> 18:06.291
This ain't no funeral home!
It's Goopy fucking Goobers!

18:06.375 --> 18:11.083
Okay. I maybe told
a teeny, tiny, little white lie.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.625
Mama ain't dead. It's her birthday.

18:13.708 --> 18:16.583
I just tranquilized her
with this here elephant dart

18:16.666 --> 18:18.750
so I could get her to her surprise party.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.041
Mama.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.833
Mama, wake your fat ass up!

18:22.916 --> 18:24.291
-Surprise!

18:28.041 --> 18:29.791
Damn. She's dead as hell.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.375
Okay, now I need you to help me
get Mama back to the house.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.541
She always wanted
to be buried in the basement.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.750
You gotta be kidding--

18:41.250 --> 18:43.833
Thester was right. Not a guard in sight.

18:43.916 --> 18:46.958
All we gotta do
is open this one unlocked door

18:47.041 --> 18:50.583
and take out the implausibly
fragile load-bearing beam inside.

18:50.666 --> 18:54.791
Then, Lovely Corp
will come tip-tap toppling down.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.500
Wait. Where's AFKAK?

18:56.583 --> 19:00.333
There's no time! It's now or never!
Somebody, open that unlocked door!

19:00.416 --> 19:01.541
Hey, don't look at me.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.541
-Oops.

19:03.625 --> 19:07.125
I destroy everything I touch.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.208
I'll do it.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.625
-Yow!

19:09.708 --> 19:13.916
Those door handles are pure silver
which the Macho Man can't touch

19:14.000 --> 19:17.166
since he was brought back
from the dead using evil magic.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.541
Oh yeah!

19:18.625 --> 19:20.625
Well, what about Camaro Bob, or Hobo-Cop?

19:20.708 --> 19:22.875
They went to buy beer for the after-party.

19:22.958 --> 19:24.458
-Damn it!
-I could easily--

19:24.541 --> 19:28.416
Shut up, Norf! We need AFKAK.
He's got functioning hands.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.166
-Come in, AFKAK. Where the fuck are you?

19:36.041 --> 19:38.416
<i>AFKAK, I repeat! Where are you?</i>

19:38.500 --> 19:41.875
Sorry, resistance,
but I gotta save Gina.

19:41.958 --> 19:44.125
-Confirm break-in at Lovely Corp.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.916
<i>All Saddams ordered to headquarters.</i>

19:50.500 --> 19:52.166
-Stop the wedding!

19:52.250 --> 19:54.625
Gina, you can't marry that man.

19:54.708 --> 19:55.750
Higher hair!

19:55.833 --> 19:58.791
Please! You are upsetting Mark Zuckerberg.

20:00.041 --> 20:02.291
There. Now you're not
under his spell anymore.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.333
What the hell is wrong with you?!

20:07.416 --> 20:11.083
The only reason you were marrying him
is because you were brainwashed by this.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.750
You're insane. You think
the only reason I'm marrying him

20:13.833 --> 20:17.166
is because of some magical
brainwashing piece of jewelry?

20:17.250 --> 20:19.000
Yes. Why else would you do it?

20:19.083 --> 20:20.541
Because I love him!

20:20.625 --> 20:21.833
Since I got back into town,

20:21.916 --> 20:24.541
you have done nothing
but try to sabotage my relationship

20:24.625 --> 20:26.666
with crazy conspiracy theories.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.333
Honestly, with what we had,

20:28.416 --> 20:31.625
I thought you'd at least respect me
enough to let me be happy.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.000
Just go, Kevin.
I never wanna see you again.

20:36.625 --> 20:41.833
Ooh. That's classic clone talk, baby.
Better check her clit again.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.541
Guys, wait. It's a trap!

20:52.500 --> 20:57.083
Norf, take these motherfuckers out using
anything from your waist to your ankles.

20:57.166 --> 21:02.750
Okay. I-I've got really bad gout
in my knees, but h-here goes.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.083
Take that!

21:04.166 --> 21:06.416
Hey! That sumbitch
tried to knee me and missed!

21:06.500 --> 21:07.333
Shoot him.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.250
Norf? Norf!

21:10.333 --> 21:13.166
No! You killed Norf!

21:13.250 --> 21:17.916
He was my best friend!
And I loved him! I loved him dearly!

21:27.291 --> 21:30.458
Damn you, AFKAK Crawford!
Damn you to hell!

21:31.041 --> 21:33.125
My God. What have I done?

21:40.333 --> 21:44.041
My life has been a limp piece of shit
since I shot my dad in the balls,

21:44.125 --> 21:45.750
but this is a new low.

21:45.833 --> 21:49.500
I betrayed my friends,
I lost the love of my life,

21:49.583 --> 21:52.208
and worst of all, I killed Nerf.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Or was it Norf?

21:56.625 --> 21:59.375
Goodbye, Paradise. Goodbye.
