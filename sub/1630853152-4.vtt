WEBVTT

00:09.510 --> 00:11.887
For fuck's sake, Cartwright. Not now.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.472
Here, give me your phone.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.057
Give me your phone!

00:15.140 --> 00:16.140
-Phone.
-For what?

00:16.225 --> 00:17.809
Just give me your phone.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.853
Where's Harper?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.940
-What the fuck? Who's th--
-Hey. Phone.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.982
-My phone?
-Your phone!

00:24.066 --> 00:25.651
Fuck off. I FaceTime my kids on this.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.487
I don't care if you ArseTime
the Pope on it. Give it to me.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.531
Service phones have tracking enabled.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.491
We need to disappear.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.494
Now, you three, go fetch Ho and Loy.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.038
And you better move it unless you want
the Dogs to bite your cocks off.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.915
Yeah, hold--
We don't know where they live.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.626
423 Middlesex Court, Hackney.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.670
16 Mervan Road, Brixton.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.381
You can figure out
the fucking postcodes yourselves.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.966
-Then where?
-You know where.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.926
Where?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.177
Blake's grave.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.555
Wait, where?

00:57.766 --> 00:59.935
I've definitely seen him before.
I recognized him.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.020
-Who?
-The head.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.065
He's one of us.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.733
Was one of us.

02:17.554 --> 02:21.558
What did you do?
What the fuck just happened?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.352
He was a traitor.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.187
A spook.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.190
I spoke to Simmonds.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.610
When?

02:31.693 --> 02:34.112
I had a prepaid. Can't be traced.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.783
Look, if I hadn't dealt with that scum,

02:37.866 --> 02:40.035
we'd still be sitting there
waiting for the cops to show up.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.119
Or the SAS.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.080
And those bastards shoot to kill.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.415
What I did was self-defense.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.876
Self-defense? He was unarmed.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.295
-He'd have done the same to us.
-The same to us how?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.130
He'd have slung us in jail, that's how!

02:52.214 --> 02:53.882
How long do you think we'd last in there?

02:53.966 --> 02:56.426
Bleeding out in the corner
from some terrorist shank.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.096
-I ain't going out like that.
-No, mate. That doesn't make any sense

02:59.179 --> 03:01.932
because he organized it, didn't he?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.517
Remember?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.562
He came to us, yeah?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.647
And then we all took the plan to Simmonds.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.065
He set us up!

03:11.066 --> 03:13.443
-Nah.
-He was always too keen, too hard-line.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.862
He'd never have gone through with it.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.614
We weren't supposed to see it through.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.157
No one was supposed to die.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.701
-That was the point.
-What are we gonna do?

03:20.784 --> 03:23.662
He's playing cards,
and you cut his fucking head off!

03:23.745 --> 03:26.081
-What the fuck are we gonna fucking do?
-Take it easy!

03:26.874 --> 03:28.166
Take it easy. I say, I say--

03:28.250 --> 03:30.294
Listen. We let the kid go.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.129
-He can identify us.
-No, no, no.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.547
He's been hooded up.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.716
He's caught a glimpse at best.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.676
He's heard our voices.
He's listening to you right now.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.554
So what? So what?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.055
He doesn't know our names, yeah?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.141
Danny Campbell, 14 Dunlop Terrace.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.475
Hey! Hey!

03:45.559 --> 03:48.061
What are you fucking playing at, hey?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.273
Hey, kid, did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

03:51.356 --> 03:53.400
He's getting a good look
at your face right now.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.569
Fuck you. Fuck you.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.822
Kid, did you hear that?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.657
If he didn't, I can say it again louder.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.784
You are a fucking snake, do you know that?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.328
-I suggest you shut your mouth…
-You fucking--

04:04.411 --> 04:05.495
…or I'll say your name and all.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.373
Yeah.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.126
Yeah.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.801
There's been no indication
from the security services

04:19.885 --> 04:21.512
to suggest they are any closer

04:21.595 --> 04:25.265
to discovering the whereabouts
of the kidnapped student, Hassan Ahmed.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.060
And while many are hoping
for his safe return,

04:28.143 --> 04:30.062
there are still millions across the world

04:30.145 --> 04:32.731
who are continuing to share
the hostage video.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.275
To explore the situation
in a broader context, I'm…

04:35.359 --> 04:36.235
Yes?

04:36.318 --> 04:38.403
We confirmed the victim. It's Alan Black.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.698
Hassan?

04:42.491 --> 04:43.742
No trace.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.620
Black died about 20 minutes ago.

04:47.955 --> 04:48.956
Lamb?

04:49.498 --> 04:51.708
Gone. His car's here.
We're bringing it in.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.336
The back door's been forced,
so it looks like he wasn't alone.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.713
Neighbor opposite said
she saw a group in a huddle.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.215
Slow Horses.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.093
Whatever it is can wait.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.387
First Desk is on the secure line, ma'am.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.138
I was told it was urgent.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.392
I have to go.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.019
Secure the scene. Deep clean.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.021
Get here as fast as you can.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.951
Ingrid.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.871
Let me reassure you, there is no need
to distract from your trip.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.291
I'm already at the airport, having walked
out of a State Department meeting.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.002
Have you completely lost control
over there? What's going on?

05:35.085 --> 05:37.087
-Lamb's gone AWOL.
-Christ.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.756
I've been worried about him,
which is why I put Sid Baker in there.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.633
What's Baker saying about Alan Black?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.720
She's in hospital.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.682
She took a bullet
in a detail with Cartwright Jr.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.601
Right.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.730
I want Lamb and his rejects
off the street and into the Park.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.566
I need to know exactly our level
of exposure here.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.650
Where's the boy?

05:58.734 --> 06:00.110
I've pulled everyone in.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.363
SO15 are standing by,
and command center is aware.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.158
Clean this up by the time I land.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.703
And if it is the Slow Horses behind it,
bury them.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.297
Fuck.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.485
Twenty for the hat.

06:42.986 --> 06:43.987
Cheers.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.134
Min, is there no way to turn that off?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.512
No. The CD's jammed in

07:08.595 --> 07:10.514
and the stereo doesn't turn off.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.932
Can you at least change the song?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.934
It's stuck.
It doesn't turn off. That's the issue.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.727
-Oh, my God.
-Fuck me, who cares?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.980
Look, what do we know about Alan Black?

07:19.815 --> 07:23.277
I know that he left Slough House
about a year ago, way before you joined.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.112
-Uh-huh.
-Where do you know him from?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.446
I t--

07:26.530 --> 07:28.949
-Maybe the Park.
-He was kicked out of the Park years ago.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.702
Yeah, for sleeping with the wife
of the Venezuelan ambassador.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.204
How did Lamb know to go to that house?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.540
Taverner, must be. He met her earlier.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.293
-What is this? Lamb and Taverner?
-Fucking hell.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.377
Lamb's cut us loose.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
That envelope he took off Moody,
that was his flight fund.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.214
If he wanted to, he could just disappear.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.885
Fucking hell, we are fucked.
Fuck, we really are fucked.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.636
Yeah, yeah, but I don't think he will.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.432
He broke me out when I was being guarded
by that Dog. He didn't have to.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.184
No, no, that's different.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.227
No, look. Lamb will have a play.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.021
He doesn't like to lose.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.355
Okay, so what do we do?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.191
Do we do what Lamb said?

08:02.274 --> 08:06.195
Or do we head to Regent's Park
and turn ourselves in?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.322
-Stick to Lamb's plan.
-Turn ourselves in.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.490
Right. Fine.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.659
I say that we round up everybody,

08:12.743 --> 08:15.621
head to Blake's grave,
and if Lamb doesn't show,

08:15.704 --> 08:17.581
then we know he's fucked us.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.208
-Yeah.
-Yes, stick to the plan.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.961
Oh, shit, did either of you get
Ho or Loy's addresses?

08:23.045 --> 08:25.255
Uh-huh. Yes. It was--

08:26.840 --> 08:30.135
-It was a crescent.
-423 Middlesex Court, Hackney, E9.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.596
16 Mervan Road, Brixton, SW2.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.515
God, and postcodes.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.352
-Bagsy, not get Ho.
-Yeah, nor me.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.270
Fucking-- Thank you.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.108
Right, you two get Struan. I'll get Ho.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.466
Ma'am.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.843
Where's the boy?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.761
We're tracking multiple vehicles.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.471
What does "multiple" mean?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.432
Thirty-five vehicles passed
the traffic cams

09:58.515 --> 10:00.934
at the end of Roupell Street
15 minutes before Lamb went in.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.272
Ma'am, I know it's not my place
to ask, but what is going on?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.191
You're right. It's not your place.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.657
Why do you think Lamb bolted?

10:17.326 --> 10:19.494
Maybe he saw Black's head
and worried about what it looked like.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.996
It looked like what it was.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.625
The head of the Slow Horse is panicking
because a Slow Horse op went south.

10:24.708 --> 10:28.045
Lamb's gone rogue,
and one of my agents is dead.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.713
Jesus Christ.

10:30.589 --> 10:31.590
Who knows about this?

10:31.673 --> 10:34.635
You, me, First Desk,
and it stays that way.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.512
I'll keep the Hub on Hassan.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.430
And I want you and your Dogs
on the Slow Horses.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.307
I'll bring Lamb in myself.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.434
This is an alias he's likely to use.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.853
If he surfaces, take backup.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.940
And, Duffy?

10:48.023 --> 10:50.609
If anyone gets hurt,
I'd rather it were Lamb.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.695
I can be sure of your silence.
I won't lose any sleep over his.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.916
-Where the fuck are we going?
-Out of London.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.795
-By the backstreets. No cameras.
-Then what?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.505
Why did you tell him my name?

11:13.257 --> 11:14.341
To focus you.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.427
There's only one way out of this.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.641
-What, the boat?
-What?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.103
My cousin's boat in Harwich.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.856
-That was the backup plan.
-You and that fucking boat.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.483
No, no, no, listen.
If it gets us to Holland or France,

11:31.567 --> 11:33.652
-whichever is close--
-I'm not getting on a boat, mate.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.903
I've got a little girl.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.614
Hey, you never see your daughter.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.950
Do you?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.328
Is that what Simmonds said?

11:43.412 --> 11:45.914
"Get to the boat," yeah?
"Get to the boat."

11:45.998 --> 11:47.207
-Simmonds?
-Yeah?

11:47.916 --> 11:50.085
Nah, he wanted us to walk out,
take no action.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.006
-What?
-Fuck off.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.800
-Christ.
-No.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.179
We're on our own, aren't we?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.640
-Aren't we?
-We don't need him.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.310
Simmonds could've got us money.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.061
He could've got us new IDs.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.022
-Got us out of this!
-We don't need Simmonds!

12:10.105 --> 12:11.857
What you did back there, that was you.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.067
-It was you!
-Do you think the cops will care?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.360
You still kidnapped someone.

12:15.444 --> 12:16.987
-You still threatened to kill him.
-Yeah.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.489
-Just listen to me, right?
-We didn't mean that, did we?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.491
-You didn't mean it?
-No, we didn't mean it!

12:21.575 --> 12:23.577
-No, we were gonna let him go, weren't we?
-Yeah.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.454
How long would that have got us inside?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.289
Like, two years.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.417
I could do that, mate.
I've done it before--

12:30.501 --> 12:33.212
Listen, listen, I say we stop the van now.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.130
We let the kid go, yeah?

12:35.839 --> 12:37.174
And we get out of the country.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.051
You just told him the escape route.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.136
No, no, no.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.472
We tie him up in the woods
somewhere on the way.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.017
We'll be gone by the time they find him.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.185
We'll be gone.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.396
Yeah?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.066
Yes?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.487
Yeah, yeah, all right. The boat.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.030
Yeah.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.677
Wait.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.849
Give Daddy a big hug.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.437
All right, monkeys, let Daddy go.
He's got important business.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.482
-At the Park?
-At the Park, yes. It's hush-hush.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.277
Isn't that right, Agent Pierce?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.321
Quite so.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.073
Shall we, Agent Loy?

14:02.885 --> 14:05.762
Hey, we should keep kissing 'cause
they might see us in the rearview mirror.

14:07.806 --> 14:08.849
Well, let me drive.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.690
Where are you? Where are you?

15:34.726 --> 15:36.937
-What's happenin', bruv?
-I'm looking for Ho.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.814
No Ho here, man.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.276
Why the fuck are you here?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.404
There's been a complaint about your music.
It's shit.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.488
Come on. We gotta go.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.782
Come on!

15:58.667 --> 15:59.793
Are you in charge?

15:59.877 --> 16:02.129
Show us your CCTV footage
from 20 minutes ago.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.847
So, do you want to talk about
what just happened?

16:11.930 --> 16:14.224
Well, we were too late is what happened.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.809
No. I meant us.

16:16.852 --> 16:20.272
I think we should talk about
how we evade MI5 security, Min.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.150
Well, it turns out
we evade them by kissing.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.736
There's not gonna be any "us"
if we don't stay ahead of the Dogs

16:25.819 --> 16:27.779
and work out
what the fuck Black was up to.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.074
Yes, of course.
But once-- once that's sorted…

16:32.117 --> 16:33.869
"us" could still be a thing?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.038
Less likely every time you bring it up.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.462
Hey, come on.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.382
They might let us share a cell.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.972
God. We really, really are fucked.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.226
There.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.770
Yeah, that's him.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.775
Out.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.861
Now. Three. Two.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.618
Yeah, here we go.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.002
-Duffy.
-He's using that ID you gave me.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.878
Booked a 06:00 a.m. flight to Istanbul.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.757
-Are you sure?
-I'm looking at the CCTV right now.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.093
His face is obscured, but it's Lamb.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.388
-We're off to Gatwick.
-Duffy!

17:35.180 --> 17:36.181
Hold on.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.310
Look at this.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.147
You dirty bastard.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.232
What?

17:45.315 --> 17:49.069
He's also booked flights from Heathrow,
Stansted, London City, Birmingham,

17:49.695 --> 17:51.989
and Manchester.
He knows we'll have to cover 'em all.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.783
-He's drawing us off.
-Yeah, while he runs for a ferry.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.035
No. I know where he's going.

18:00.664 --> 18:01.790
Oh, God.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.440
Whoever you are, back off. I'm armed.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.526
-No, you're not.
-Lamb?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.237
Come on. Open up.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.201
Now.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.790
It-- It's the middle of the night.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.959
You can't just show up unannounced.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.836
No. Leave the light off.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.465
What do you want?

18:52.424 --> 18:53.884
Fallen off the wagon, have we?

18:54.384 --> 18:56.053
It's actually a water bottle.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.138
You've probably never seen one.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.098
Get dressed.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.685
-I live here. You can't tell me--
-Just get dressed!

19:12.110 --> 19:13.278
Where are we going?

19:16.073 --> 19:17.074
Where are we going?

19:17.157 --> 19:19.201
-What are you doing?
-I'll tell you on the way.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.036
We just gotta move fast.
The Dogs are on us.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.498
Why are they after me?
I've not done anything.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.626
Well, nothing they'd be able to trace.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.004
We gotta keep switching vehicles.

19:36.718 --> 19:40.556
You can't hot-wire any of these.
You need to hack the alarm system.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.308
I can help with that for the right price.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.061
Come on.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.145
I'll go analog.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.737
I'll have a bacon double cheeseburger…

19:55.821 --> 19:59.074
-Yeah?
-…chips, a can of Fanta

19:59.700 --> 20:01.535
and…

20:02.744 --> 20:05.038
-You just got Kit Kats and TWIX, yeah?
-Just that, thanks.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.501
Listen.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.172
If you're in any kind of personal trouble,

20:14.131 --> 20:17.092
I just want you to know
I couldn't give a fuck.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.969
And I don't want to be dragged into it.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.262
Yeah, you're already in it.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.555
Wha--

20:26.185 --> 20:27.019
Fuck!

20:31.356 --> 20:32.357
Fuck!

20:35.027 --> 20:36.153
Yeah?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.238
We have Loy downstairs for you, ma'am.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.073
I'll be right down.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.642
Ma'am.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.202
Hello.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.039
Would you excuse me a minute? I just--

21:29.957 --> 21:33.043
It is relentless up there.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.630
-I can imagine.
-Oh, no, you can't.

21:37.256 --> 21:38.549
None of you can.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.554
How does it feel to be back here
at the Park?

21:44.513 --> 21:47.266
Well, this isn't really the Park I knew.

21:47.349 --> 21:51.144
I mean, I've never been down here.
I didn't know we had rooms like this.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.604
Not many people do.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.898
That's why I chose it for you.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.943
I don't want anyone to know you're here.

22:01.738 --> 22:05.242
My wife knows I'm here… at the Park.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.036
She still thinks you work here,
doesn't she?

22:09.705 --> 22:11.331
I've been trying to find the right moment.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.666
It's been a year.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.295
Your little boy must be, what, six?

22:17.421 --> 22:19.173
And Evie, seven?

22:19.256 --> 22:20.674
No, eight.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.344
They must love the idea
their daddy's James Bond.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.764
I understand why you don't want anyone
to know the truth.

22:27.848 --> 22:29.975
Is that what this is about?
Me lying to my family?

22:30.058 --> 22:32.311
You lied to the investigators first,
didn't you?

22:33.729 --> 22:35.022
I panicked.

22:35.105 --> 22:39.067
Said you didn't send the email,
even though it came under your login.

22:41.069 --> 22:42.070
Do you want to read it?

22:43.572 --> 22:45.407
-Not really.
-I think you should.

22:51.455 --> 22:54.124
"Anyone else surprised
by Tearney's outfit?

22:54.875 --> 22:56.710
ISIS chic.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.212
Maybe she's undercover?"

22:58.754 --> 23:02.007
She wore a shawl at a press conference.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.510
It-- It-- It looked a bit like-- like…

23:07.679 --> 23:09.598
You used a service email chain

23:09.681 --> 23:14.353
to imply that the head of MI5 was working
undercover for a terrorist organization.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.979
But it was meant as a joke.

23:17.272 --> 23:20.275
But it's a pattern of behavior, Struan.

23:20.359 --> 23:22.027
Joking around.

23:22.945 --> 23:25.531
Undermining your superiors.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.867
Questioning the line of command.
Not taking your job seriously.

23:28.951 --> 23:31.828
And what we do here is very serious.

23:34.248 --> 23:36.166
So if you were to come back here
to work at the Park,

23:36.250 --> 23:38.585
I need to know
that you have learnt your lesson.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.128
Absolutely!

23:40.796 --> 23:42.047
I can't promise anything.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.927
You probably know
how many people have made it back

23:47.010 --> 23:49.513
from Slough House
to upstairs here at Regent's Park.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.099
None.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.726
It's not impossible.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.441
Have you seen anything unusual
at Slough House,

24:01.525 --> 24:03.068
any activity?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.492
No.

24:17.708 --> 24:18.917
I don't think so.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.257
What sort of unusual activity?

24:27.467 --> 24:29.344
It's a shame you haven't noticed anything.

24:29.428 --> 24:30.888
I was relying on you.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.474
You see, I have a problem.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.894
Quite a big problem.

24:37.686 --> 24:40.189
How would you like to be
part of the solution?

24:43.901 --> 24:46.278
Slow down! This isn't Mario Kart!

24:46.361 --> 24:48.322
Can you get Alan Black's
service record up on that?

24:48.405 --> 24:50.782
Can you stop wasting my time
with rhetorical questions?

24:52.951 --> 24:55.162
Can you just do it please?
Or whatever the magic word is.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.581
How did you find me?
Those are the magic words.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.458
Stop dicking around, Roddy. Just do it.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.586
No, but this is a major security breach.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.796
I need to review protocols
so it doesn't happen again.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.633
You overlooked a massive weak spot
in your defenses.

25:07.716 --> 25:08.967
Impossible.

25:09.051 --> 25:11.136
I hacked the personnel database
at the Park.

25:11.220 --> 25:12.930
I changed my address.

25:13.013 --> 25:16.016
My phone, my Internet, my bills,
even my bank account

25:16.099 --> 25:19.019
are all linked to false IDs
that rotate every 24 hours.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.438
I'm so far off the grid,
I don't even know where the grid is.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.523
Lamb followed you home.

25:24.525 --> 25:25.609
When the fuck?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.402
I don't know, but he told everyone.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.531
Black! Come on.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.743
You worked with Black, didn't you?

25:35.786 --> 25:37.287
-Roddy!
-Yeah!

25:37.371 --> 25:39.915
What was Black doing in that house
with Hassan Ahmed?

25:39.998 --> 25:42.251
Any clues in anything he said or did?

25:42.334 --> 25:44.002
Yeah, on the last day he said, "Fuck you.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.588
I'm off to kidnap an Asian kid
and behead him for the Union Jack."

25:46.672 --> 25:48.757
Fuck's sake, Roddy. Right, fine. Okay?

25:49.675 --> 25:51.385
You drive like a maniac, you know.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.766
-That's him.
-Eyes on the road!

25:57.850 --> 25:58.851
Look ahead!

25:58.934 --> 26:01.144
I've definitely seen him somewhere.
Come on.

26:02.104 --> 26:05.232
We never crossed paths at Slough House.
I think he left before I joined the Park.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.192
This has literally nothing to do with me.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.152
Do you recognize him?

26:10.404 --> 26:14.449
Alan Black.
Left Slough House soon after I arrived.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.285
Seen him since?

26:22.082 --> 26:23.083
You sure?

26:24.376 --> 26:27.421
You haven't seen him recently
in the company of Jackson Lamb?

26:30.424 --> 26:32.551
Well, not since he left.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.187
Then you're not part
of the solution then, are you?

26:43.270 --> 26:44.980
You're just another problem.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.164
What are you doing?
This isn't Blake's grave.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.665
I just need to know that she's okay.

27:03.749 --> 27:04.958
-All right?
-Why?

27:05.876 --> 27:07.336
She can't help you now!

27:08.045 --> 27:10.547
You'll be lucky if you get ten minutes
before the Park get here!

27:10.631 --> 27:12.966
I'll be out in five.
Just leave the engine running!

27:13.050 --> 27:14.051
Fuck.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.779
You have two new messages.

27:33.862 --> 27:34.947
Message one.

27:35.656 --> 27:39.076
This is Diana Taverner.
You need to come to the Park straightaway.

27:39.159 --> 27:40.994
Jackson Lamb's gone rogue.

27:41.745 --> 27:42.955
Message two.

27:43.789 --> 27:47.459
Catherine, Diana Taverner again.
I really need you to come to the Park.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.294
There are things
about Charles Partner's death

27:49.378 --> 27:50.879
that Lamb hasn't told you.

27:50.963 --> 27:52.172
Call me.

28:01.014 --> 28:01.849
Morning.

28:05.769 --> 28:08.397
I picked up your blue suit.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.901
You could wear that today if you fancy.

28:15.696 --> 28:17.614
-Charles?
-What's taking so long?

28:18.824 --> 28:20.158
Get out of my bedroom.

28:20.242 --> 28:22.870
What, you think I want to catch you
in your underwear?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.163
I imagine you'd like that.

28:25.247 --> 28:29.042
Almost as much as I'd like to see you
in your nylon Y-fronts.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.919
Come on.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.045
Now!

28:41.555 --> 28:43.599
What was Taverner talking about?

28:43.682 --> 28:45.475
What don't I know about Charles's death?

28:45.559 --> 28:47.978
She's screwing with your head.

28:48.061 --> 28:51.315
Look, you could leave with me now
or with less friendly people later.

28:51.398 --> 28:52.399
It's up to you.

29:00.032 --> 29:01.909
No, leave the phone.

29:15.005 --> 29:18.258
Hi. Sorry, can you tell me
which room Sidonie Baker's in?

29:18.884 --> 29:20.302
It's immediate family only.

29:20.385 --> 29:21.845
Yeah, I'm her stepbrother.

29:21.929 --> 29:23.597
Can you sign in on the screen?

29:24.973 --> 29:25.974
Yeah, yeah.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.821
-Great. Which room?
-ICU room 4.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.949
-End of the corridor on the right.
-Great, thank you.

29:52.209 --> 29:53.335
Pierce?

29:56.672 --> 29:57.923
Baker has a visitor.

30:00.342 --> 30:02.219
What the fuck is he doing there?

30:02.719 --> 30:04.054
Who can get there fastest?

30:05.597 --> 30:08.308
Cartwright's back at the hospital.
Get him.

30:08.392 --> 30:09.434
With pleasure.

30:13.814 --> 30:15.107
Do fuck off.

30:16.859 --> 30:18.610
It's River, isn't it?

30:18.694 --> 30:21.488
Has he gone off the rails,
and now we're paying the price?

30:21.572 --> 30:23.198
Well, not a million miles off.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.368
Baker's been hurt. Moody's dead.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.538
There's probably a C&amp;C out on all of us.

30:29.621 --> 30:30.789
Fuckers.

30:30.873 --> 30:32.624
How badly hurt is Sid?

30:32.708 --> 30:36.545
Not as badly hurt as Moody's dead.
Did you catch that bit?

30:36.628 --> 30:40.757
Jed Moody was always going to end badly,
but I like Sid.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.369
Busy night?

31:09.453 --> 31:11.663
You angling for overtime, Nick?

31:11.747 --> 31:14.750
-You're talking to the wrong bloke.
-Need to know if you're carrying a weapon.

31:14.833 --> 31:15.834
Nope.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.544
I'll have to check that.
Spread 'em, please.

31:17.628 --> 31:21.507
Please, Nick, shut the kid up.
Come on, it's embarrassing. You're a pro.

31:21.590 --> 31:24.092
You can tell from the fold of my clothes
I'm not carrying.

31:24.176 --> 31:27.262
-I'm afraid you don't get a choice--
-If he takes another step towards me,

31:27.346 --> 31:29.848
he'll be frisking me with broken wrists.

31:37.648 --> 31:38.649
Come on.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.787
Webb, you can drive.

31:52.371 --> 31:54.081
Ms. Standish, you're up front.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.000
Lamb, you're in the back with me.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.221
Come on.

32:09.847 --> 32:11.682
Are you serious?

32:22.192 --> 32:25.654
Time's up, Cartwright. Screw all this.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.323
Come on. Unbelievable.

33:09.907 --> 33:11.450
You love it when I'm hard on you.

33:14.328 --> 33:16.705
What about that story
about you tailing Taverner?

33:16.788 --> 33:17.789
Is that just a myth?

33:20.918 --> 33:23.337
No. Not a myth, actually.
That really did happen.

33:25.297 --> 33:27.341
Shit.

33:31.512 --> 33:32.513
Thanks, Sid.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.152
Yeah, f--

34:21.478 --> 34:22.938
Wait, wait, wait!

34:25.274 --> 34:28.569
-Door closing.
-Come on, come on, come on.

34:34.824 --> 34:37.494
-For fuck--
-Hi.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.248
Routine or emergency?

34:41.331 --> 34:42.748
She's just switching wards.

34:42.833 --> 34:43.792
Thank you.

35:03.312 --> 35:04.646
Oi.

35:12.321 --> 35:13.363
Hey!

35:23.373 --> 35:24.458
Shit.

35:37.429 --> 35:41.225
Right. About 20 miles outside of Harwich,

35:41.308 --> 35:43.227
we pass through some countryside.

35:43.727 --> 35:45.270
Looks like there's some woods.

35:46.522 --> 35:47.564
We leave him there, yeah?

35:48.607 --> 35:50.192
That sounds good to me.

35:51.276 --> 35:52.277
Yeah?

35:52.819 --> 35:53.904
If you like.

35:58.242 --> 35:59.493
Do you hear that, kid?

35:59.576 --> 36:02.579
We're gonna leave you someplace
and someone is gonna find you, okay?

36:03.121 --> 36:04.998
Yeah? It's okay.

36:05.082 --> 36:07.584
Really, it's just a bit fucked up
is what it is.

36:09.127 --> 36:12.589
We didn't mean it to go like this.
We just wanted to wake people up.

36:12.673 --> 36:14.842
Do you know what I mean?
It's-- It is what it is.

36:15.801 --> 36:16.802
I'm…

36:18.804 --> 36:19.972
I'm sorry.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.939
-You're sorry?
-Hey. Hey!

36:29.022 --> 36:31.066
Someone died, okay?

36:31.149 --> 36:33.193
Spook or not, that's not right.

36:33.277 --> 36:34.611
Are they sorry?

36:35.195 --> 36:37.698
When they kill our troops
and rape our women?

36:39.116 --> 36:40.117
Nah.

36:40.742 --> 36:41.869
Fuck that.

36:42.619 --> 36:43.620
"Sorry"?

36:44.454 --> 36:47.416
-What the fuck is wrong with you, mate?
-What's-- What's wro--

36:47.499 --> 36:51.003
The kid is not a murderer, okay?
And neither am I.

36:51.086 --> 36:52.379
I am though, aren't I?

36:53.839 --> 36:57.301
The way I see it, I'm already going down
for one murder, so what's a second?

36:59.219 --> 37:00.596
Fuck it.

37:00.679 --> 37:02.764
-We're killing him.
-I'm not killing anyone, mate.

37:02.848 --> 37:04.558
-We've lost our fucking--
-Take it easy!

37:04.641 --> 37:06.643
Shut your mouths! The question is then

37:06.727 --> 37:10.147
whether you've got the balls
to stop me, isn't it?

37:12.274 --> 37:13.275
Yes?

37:32.461 --> 37:35.214
-Yeah?
-Inbound with Lamb and Standish.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.967
Tell her she best interrogate me
in a room with a window.

37:39.635 --> 37:43.222
I had a lamb bhuna earlier
that's gonna make its presence felt.

37:51.396 --> 37:52.481
What's happening?

37:52.564 --> 37:54.775
Catherine Standish is being brought in.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.195
I'm sure I can make her remember
what you seem to have forgotten.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.696
What happens to me?

37:59.780 --> 38:01.657
Are you gonna tell my wife
I don't work here?

38:01.740 --> 38:03.575
Yes. And I'm gonna tell her
you're being held

38:03.659 --> 38:05.953
as part of the investigation
into Alan Black's death.

38:06.036 --> 38:08.288
No! No, wait, wait, no, no.
Please, please, please.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.207
It's coming back to me now.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.418
I blanked it out because it felt like
something I shouldn't have seen.

38:14.545 --> 38:19.091
I definitely remember seeing Lamb
and Alan Black together

38:19.842 --> 38:21.760
after Black had left Slough House.

38:25.514 --> 38:28.642
If I rack my brains,
I can probably put a date on it.

38:37.776 --> 38:39.111
Well, we've got it on tape.

38:39.194 --> 38:42.406
Let's err on the side of caution.
Get it down in writing.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.034
Sit.

38:52.624 --> 38:55.210
Is she gonna stick us
in those new basement cells?

38:55.752 --> 38:57.671
I've not seen them myself.

38:58.422 --> 39:00.424
I used to work out of the old building.

39:02.050 --> 39:05.387
But, you know,
I've been in the Stasi cells,

39:05.470 --> 39:07.472
so anything you've got will be a luxury.

39:09.308 --> 39:10.517
And then what?

39:10.601 --> 39:13.395
Lady Di's gonna rewrite the timeline,

39:13.478 --> 39:16.940
stick Slough House in the frame
for this fucking disaster.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.325
Is no one gonna say "Bless you"?

39:27.576 --> 39:28.577
No?

39:29.578 --> 39:30.704
Bit rude.

39:33.624 --> 39:35.626
Course, she'd rather
that kid had his head cut off

39:35.709 --> 39:37.211
than admit it was her fault.

39:38.629 --> 39:40.464
She's scorching the earth.

39:41.215 --> 39:42.841
She's covering her tracks.

39:43.884 --> 39:46.678
But it's the covering of the tracks
that always gets you in the end,

39:46.762 --> 39:47.971
isn't that right, Nick?

39:49.306 --> 39:51.058
I mean, she knows that, of course.

39:52.017 --> 39:54.019
She thinks she's the exception.

39:55.604 --> 39:57.439
That's what everybody thinks.

39:57.523 --> 39:58.857
Everybody's always wrong.

39:58.941 --> 40:02.277
Look, the last time I was in the Park,
Diana Taverner was in charge.

40:02.361 --> 40:05.280
Until that changes, I'll do what she says.

40:05.364 --> 40:07.282
Yeah, but it's all gonna unravel, Nick.

40:07.366 --> 40:11.203
The sensible thing to do would be
forget Lady Di's London rules

40:11.286 --> 40:15.123
and concentrate on finding that kid
before he gets whacked.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.960
If that's not already happened.

40:19.628 --> 40:23.215
Oh, Jesus! You keep a cat in here or what?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.677
Standish, you got a tissue in that bag?

40:31.723 --> 40:33.350
I've only got one left.

40:34.351 --> 40:35.561
Give us it here then.

40:35.644 --> 40:38.397
I have a question I want answered first.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.315
Oh, for-- What now?

40:40.399 --> 40:42.192
The question pertains to something

40:42.276 --> 40:44.987
that was raised in a voice mail
that I received tonight.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.614
I'll tell you later.

40:48.866 --> 40:49.867
Pinkie promise.

40:51.743 --> 40:52.828
Tissue.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.711
Now, we all know I'm not
going to shoot you dead, Mr. Webb.

41:00.794 --> 41:03.255
But I'll put a bullet through your foot
if I have to.

41:04.131 --> 41:05.090
Pull over.

41:07.134 --> 41:09.428
-I said pull over.
-Yeah, all right, all right.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.892
This is your stop, boys.

41:22.524 --> 41:25.152
You two can walk from here
if that's all right.

41:43.670 --> 41:46.590
You're full of surprises, Standish.
You know that?

41:49.593 --> 41:52.179
How'd you know my Y-fronts are nylon?

41:53.430 --> 41:55.098
Because I have to buy them for you.

41:56.767 --> 41:57.809
Drip-dry.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.561
Very efficient.
