01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.912
Look at you. You're so soft.

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:10.080
(HONKS)

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.082
ALL: Aw!

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.959
I wish I could keep one.

01:26:14.377 --> 01:26:15.419
(HISSES)

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.382
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:26.138
(GAGGING)

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:31.977
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.396
Bye, Kevin!

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:37.233
(HONKS)

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:45.115
Ready?

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.826
Ready.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.163
(BARKING)

01:26:57.587 --> 01:26:59.338
STRAUCH: And by receiving
their badges,

01:26:59.422 --> 01:27:04.093
the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:08.305
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:13.018
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.688
For Assisting the Elderly...

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:19.692
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

01:27:22.445 --> 01:27:25.531
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:29.869
I'm here for him.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:32.329
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.586
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:43.257
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:48.512
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:52.641
The Ellie badge.

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:56.729
Wow.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:03.944
STRAUCH: All right,
I think that covers everybody.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.071
So let's give a big Explorer call

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:09.867
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.243
Ready, everybody?

01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:12.870
ALL: Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.996
(DOGS BARKING)

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.831
(DOGS HOWLING)

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.629
- Blue one.
- Red one.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:24.089
- Blue one.
- DUG: Gray one.

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:27.051
- Red one.
- RUSSELL: That's a bike.

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:29.136
CARL: It's red, isn't it?

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.096
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.098
CARL: No, I'm not. Red one.

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:34.975
RUSSELL: That's a fire hydrant.

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.602
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.146
CARL: Maybe I need new glasses.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:29:02.378
RUSSELL: Another blue one.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:05.931
Adventure is out there
It's heading our way

01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:10.102
So grab your scarf and goggles
Let's fly

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:14.773
I've mapped out our journey
We're up here to stay

01:34:14.857 --> 01:34:19.111
A sunset is our home
A moonbeam we will own

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.990
My spirit of adventure is you

01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:27.703
Freaks of nature span a globe
That's too big to deny

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:32.124
With canine guards we'll travel there
and spit into their eye

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:36.837
Bang, bang
Once the smoke has cleared

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:40.841
After all the crowds have cheered

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:45.429
We'll make it a joint venture
Before we're in our dentures

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:49.141
My spirit of adventure is you

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:11.496
Adventure is out there
Let's crack some champagne

01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:15.834
I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall

01:35:15.918 --> 01:35:20.338
To say that I'm traveled
is far too mundane

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:24.718
Let's grab our aero-fare
The high-brows will be there

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:29.056
The spirit of adventure
is something to indenture

01:35:29.140 --> 01:36:44.047
My spirit of adventure is you

01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:51.312
