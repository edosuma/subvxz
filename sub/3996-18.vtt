WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:10.259
Nick, your houseguest is
urinating in the bathroom

00:10.311 --> 00:12.178
Tony the Tiger style.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.897
- Naked with a kerchief?
- What?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.198
Naked with a kerchief.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.701
No, what do you call
top, no pants?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.904
Oh, that's like a Winnie the Pooh
or a Paddington. - Honey the Smacks Frog.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.288
- There's a Donald the Duck.
- I guess pretty much

00:22.373 --> 00:23.289
any kind of bear
except for Yogi

00:23.807 --> 00:25.157
'cause that's naked
with a tie.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.742
Alvin, Simon, Theodore.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.911
I saw his entire butt.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.496
Look, Dirk's a good guy.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.581
He was my roommate
when I was in law school.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.117
- Smartest guy I know.
- So, he's a lawyer?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.253
No, he's not a lawyer,
but he does have a law degree,

00:37.337 --> 00:38.788
a business degree,
and a master's in agriculture.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.289
He's kind of like
a degree collector.

00:40.357 --> 00:42.758
He's got his PhD in poetry,
so...

00:42.843 --> 00:44.543
That sucks for poems.

00:44.594 --> 00:45.961
How'd it go with Fancyman?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.080
It was an amazing first date,

00:48.131 --> 00:50.633
except for one awkward
part at the end.

00:50.701 --> 00:53.753
I don't go on dates
very often.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.422
Guys my age always want
to skip the date

00:56.473 --> 00:58.424
and just go right
for the gold.

00:59.475 --> 01:01.194
Which I don't give them

01:01.261 --> 01:03.279
because I'm stingy
with my gold.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.230
Unless they dig for it.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.769
I haven't even gotten
to the awkward part yet.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.655
Oh, hi.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.663
Black sedan?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.331
Uh, yeah.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.166
What?

01:24.251 --> 01:25.952
So, he patted me on the back.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.169
I thought I'd
at least get

01:27.221 --> 01:29.672
a front pat. Whoo-ha!

01:29.723 --> 01:30.773
What?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.175
Look,

01:32.243 --> 01:33.509
he probably just got nervous.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.861
No, Russell's never nervous.

01:34.945 --> 01:36.362
That's the worst answer.

01:36.447 --> 01:37.563
Winston, what do you think?

01:37.648 --> 01:38.848
Oh, thank God.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.149
Hey, what's up, baby?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.451
- Ooh.
- Hey, is that Shelby?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.570
What was that?
That was a cat sound.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.606
Oh, because you did the whip,
we should've...

01:46.674 --> 01:47.991
- Guys! - It should have been
the other way around.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.709
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.

01:49.793 --> 01:52.194
But next time you guys
want advice about girls,

01:52.246 --> 01:53.880
don't come crawling to me.

01:53.964 --> 01:55.048
- You got it.
- That sounds good.

01:55.132 --> 01:57.650
No, that was a joke; I love it

01:57.718 --> 01:59.786
when you guys ask me stuff.
It makes me feel really important.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.771
- And I love it...
- "One shade the more,"

02:01.839 --> 02:03.306
"One ray the less,"

02:03.373 --> 02:05.808
"Had half impaired
the nameless grace."

02:05.876 --> 02:07.844
Are you wearing
a ladies' scarf?

02:07.911 --> 02:09.095
Come to my lecture
tomorrow night.

02:09.679 --> 02:11.714
Absolutely not.

02:12.765 --> 02:13.850
She's missing out,
my man.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.318
- Hey, Schmidt?
- Yeah?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.552
Mind if I borrow your car
to take Shelby to the airport?

02:16.603 --> 02:18.438
Oh, I don't have a <i>car,</i> Winston.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.557
Hey, Schmidt, uh,
you mind if I use the, uh,

02:22.608 --> 02:23.559
"man-bulance"?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.278
The man-bulance is resting.
He needs to get ready

02:25.362 --> 02:27.313
for the corporate team-building
retreat on Monday.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.082
That's cool. I'm sure the
man-bulance couldn't handle

02:29.166 --> 02:30.750
all of Shelby's luggage anyway.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.618
Ooh... What the hell is
wrong with you, Winston?

02:32.703 --> 02:34.921
The man-bulance could fit
the luggage of nine Shelbys.

02:35.005 --> 02:36.372
It has the towing capacity

02:36.440 --> 02:37.807
of a thousand Shelbys.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.042
You know what?
Here you go, Winston.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.209
There you go.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.844
- Enjoy luxury.
- All good, man.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.629
I got your second set,
so thank you.

02:43.714 --> 02:45.098
How'd you get
my second set of keys?

02:45.182 --> 02:46.415
Hey, someone left
your door open.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.384
Someone left
your face beautiful.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.586
Who is that?

02:50.637 --> 02:51.888
Apparently, his name is Dirk.

02:54.390 --> 02:56.859
Sorry, Dirk, I'm
seeing somebody.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.227
But should that stop you

02:58.278 --> 02:59.562
from seeing this?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.064
Yeah!

03:01.115 --> 03:02.865
That's awesome.
Does he keep you happy?

03:02.933 --> 03:03.800
He does what he's told.

03:06.036 --> 03:07.904
So you're the boss
and he's your little secretary?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.655
Oh,

03:09.723 --> 03:11.274
you're a sex-cretary?

03:11.342 --> 03:13.042
I am definitely the boss.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.546
Sex-cretary,
he just made that up.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.304
I hate bachelorette parties.

03:25.389 --> 03:27.807
I have, like 50 different
penis items in my carry-on.

03:28.191 --> 03:29.392
This plane goes down,
there's gonna be

03:29.459 --> 03:31.844
some sharks doing
some really weird stuff.

03:31.929 --> 03:33.462
Sharks? I thought
you were going to Vegas?

03:33.514 --> 03:34.964
No, I'm going to Mexico.
I thought I told you that.

03:35.415 --> 03:36.132
Hmm-mm.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.567
Well, if you don't
want me to go,

03:37.634 --> 03:39.152
I don't have to go.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.020
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I want you to go.

03:41.105 --> 03:42.572
It'll be good, you know?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.140
We spent the last
five nights together.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.075
I mean, you know,
we both could use some space.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.779
Right.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.833
- Did I say something wrong?
- What?

03:53.917 --> 03:57.253
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you
across all the space.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.591
Hey.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.926
Great news, um,
Jess is taking a shower.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.263
Okay, I just need, like,
a good, solid ten minutes.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.514
Eat this granola bar first.

04:09.099 --> 04:11.968
I want to try something
called the horse trough.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.604
No, Cece.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.272
I'm not having sex
with you right now.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.940
I have to get everybody
in the company's name

04:18.007 --> 04:19.459
into a version of "We
Didn't Start the Fire."

04:19.526 --> 04:20.726
Totally fine.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.229
What do you need,
like, 20 minutes?

04:23.313 --> 04:25.148
Cece, this...
Okay, this is real work

04:25.699 --> 04:28.517
for my real boss who is not you.

04:28.569 --> 04:32.238
Oh, I get what's happening here.

04:32.322 --> 04:36.192
It's 'cause Ponytail called you
a "sex receptionist."

04:36.243 --> 04:38.327
A sex receptionist
answers calls all day.

04:38.378 --> 04:41.664
A sex-cretary does
scheduling, light filing,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.249
basically runs the office.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.500
So, first of all,

04:44.551 --> 04:46.719
thank you for the demotion.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.870
And second of all, I quit.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.472
So, I'll see you tonight.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.174
Did you not hear anything
I just said?

04:51.225 --> 04:54.060
Oh, no, I totally heard you
loud and clear,

04:54.144 --> 04:58.564
but do you know
who didn't happen to hear you?

04:58.649 --> 05:00.183
What are you doing?

05:00.234 --> 05:01.217
Don't-don't-don't involve them.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.518
Oh, my...

05:02.569 --> 05:03.820
They just didn't hear.

05:03.887 --> 05:04.854
Don't bring them into this.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.222
Don't tell me.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.491
Tell them.

05:11.861 --> 05:12.795
Hi.

05:12.862 --> 05:16.365
I guess, uh, Harold, Kumar,

05:16.416 --> 05:17.950
I love... I love you both.

05:18.035 --> 05:21.037
All the zany adventures
we've had.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.405
But we can't go to
White Castle today.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.540
Just can't do it.

05:24.608 --> 05:25.858
You're serious about this?

05:26.926 --> 05:27.760
Cece?

05:28.345 --> 05:29.578
Is Schmidt bothering you?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.013
This is not over.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.816
Okay?

05:33.884 --> 05:35.885
Was it like a caress
or like a... like a pat?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.637
No, like a pat;
It was distinctly a pat,

05:37.721 --> 05:39.021
and it was actually
kind of hot.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.389
The man knows how
to pat a back.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.141
At any point during the night,

05:42.226 --> 05:44.426
did you do
your Kermit the Frog imitation?

05:44.478 --> 05:45.695
Maybe.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.863
Once or twice.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.764
No, stop, it freaks me out
and you know.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.483
Well, what do I do?

05:50.567 --> 05:52.151
I really, really want to see him
again, like, badly.

05:52.236 --> 05:54.370
- You just call him.
- I can't.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.655
He's too sophisticated.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.406
He told me he'd run
with the bulls,

05:57.457 --> 05:58.824
and I quote,

05:58.892 --> 06:00.793
"not the touristy bulls
in Pamplona."

06:00.861 --> 06:02.295
Big deal. Just call him.

06:02.379 --> 06:04.997
Schmidt says the moment
a woman touches a phone,

06:05.065 --> 06:07.667
she loses her power
unless she's sexting,

06:07.751 --> 06:09.919
in which case, she
gains a half power.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.053
Okay, well,
that's Schmidt just talking...

06:11.121 --> 06:12.672
I mean, what does Schmidt know?

06:12.756 --> 06:14.623
Look, all the guys
that you live with-- boys.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.759
You've only dated boys.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.460
Russell is a grown man,

06:18.512 --> 06:19.812
and I bet he likes women

06:19.897 --> 06:21.797
who know what they want
and ask for it.

06:21.865 --> 06:25.017
He has a hot air balloon
in a hangar in Palm Springs.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.903
Okay, sweetheart,
you are sophisticated.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.404
You've just got
to pick up the phone,

06:28.471 --> 06:30.756
and you ask him out for dinner.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.491
You know what? You're right:
I am sophisticated.

06:32.576 --> 06:33.642
I'm gonna do this.

06:34.694 --> 06:35.844
What is <i>that?</i>

06:36.196 --> 06:37.330
It's a phone.

06:37.414 --> 06:38.281
Oh, God.

06:39.714 --> 06:42.966
And thus ends our journey
through the words of time.

06:43.534 --> 06:45.885
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan,

06:45.970 --> 06:48.037
from Dylan to Dylan.

06:49.105 --> 06:50.841
They're both named Dylan.

06:50.892 --> 06:52.926
- Watch him bring it home, man.
- Do I have to?

06:53.010 --> 06:54.477
We have to rage.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.879
"Rage against the dying
of the light.

06:56.931 --> 06:58.514
"And when the light

06:58.565 --> 07:01.601
is no longer bright."

07:05.606 --> 07:09.392
"Don't think twice,
it's all right."

07:09.443 --> 07:10.559
It's over.

07:13.113 --> 07:14.580
Smartest guy I know.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.733
Professor?

07:17.785 --> 07:18.734
- Professor?
- Yeah?

07:18.786 --> 07:20.119
We wanted to remind you

07:20.204 --> 07:22.622
about the post-lecture
wine and cheese event.

07:22.706 --> 07:24.207
A soiree, eh?

07:24.258 --> 07:25.675
Super classy.

07:25.742 --> 07:28.428
Crackers, bubbles,
crab, hummus.

07:28.512 --> 07:30.746
Yeah, I-I e-mailed
you about that.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.216
That was me. - Oh, sometimes when
I get a really long e-mail...

07:36.903 --> 07:37.753
I don't read it.

07:38.889 --> 07:40.556
Bye.

07:41.607 --> 07:43.309
Oh, Mommy.

07:43.394 --> 07:44.861
All right,
Dirk, what about Deb?

07:44.928 --> 07:46.529
You guys having problems
or something?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.431
No, no, no,
everything's fine.

07:48.982 --> 07:50.733
She left me and moved
out of the house.

07:50.784 --> 07:53.269
I guess it was "too
hard to support me."

07:53.820 --> 07:54.737
"Financially."

07:54.739 --> 07:56.957
It's all fine; her leaving
has allowed me to realize

07:57.041 --> 07:58.742
the one thing that was
missing in my life.

07:58.793 --> 07:59.626
Scarves?

07:59.710 --> 08:01.495
Undergraduate ladies.

08:01.579 --> 08:03.413
You see, girls our age,
what do they want?

08:03.464 --> 08:05.448
They want us to wed them,
sire their children.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.550
They want you to have

08:06.617 --> 08:08.001
- a-a bedframe.
- Right, yeah.

08:08.085 --> 08:09.553
Hmm? They want you
to eat off plates,

08:09.620 --> 08:10.921
but girls in college

08:10.972 --> 08:12.288
all they want you to do

08:12.340 --> 08:15.559
is tell them that
their photography has potential.

08:15.626 --> 08:17.844
Yeah, but don't they want to
hang out wth guys their own age?

08:17.929 --> 08:19.763
Have you hung out with a
20-year-old dude lately?

08:19.814 --> 08:22.632
Trust me, they are setting the
bar very, very low. - Right.

08:22.683 --> 08:25.268
They haven't even gone through their
gay phase yet. - Hey, man, I'm gonna

08:25.319 --> 08:26.302
give Shelby a call
really quick.

08:26.354 --> 08:27.637
Just want to check on her,
see if everything's all right.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.739
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude, relax, okay?

08:29.807 --> 08:31.691
I just said we're gonna give
each other space,

08:31.776 --> 08:33.243
doesn't mean
I can't call her, right,

08:33.309 --> 08:36.111
to see if anything funny
happened on the plane.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.614
You know what "space"
means, right?

08:37.664 --> 08:39.499
That's space to have sex
with other people.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.668
No, space means
you go to Mexico,

08:42.251 --> 08:43.787
and you do not have sex
with other people.

08:44.238 --> 08:44.988
Watch this.

08:45.039 --> 08:47.257
Nick, don't give my any space.

08:47.324 --> 08:48.675
You got it, my man.

08:48.759 --> 08:50.510
See, this makes it pretty hard

08:50.595 --> 08:52.512
for you and I to have sex
right now, doesn't it?

08:52.597 --> 08:54.180
Now, Nick, I want you

08:54.265 --> 08:55.515
- to give me some space.
- You got it.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.184
All this space
allows me opportunity

08:58.269 --> 09:00.020
to have as much sex as we want.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.021
Smartest guy I know.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.272
See how much sex

09:02.339 --> 09:04.774
- we could be having?
- That-that does...

09:04.842 --> 09:07.010
Get out of my way,
bookworms!

09:07.061 --> 09:09.312
You ready to make love
to some college chicks?

09:09.363 --> 09:11.197
Hey, when's the last time
you had mono?

09:11.282 --> 09:12.616
I don't know.

09:12.683 --> 09:15.569
Tomorrow, you're
gonna say yesterday.

09:15.653 --> 09:17.454
I have that
team-building research

09:17.521 --> 09:19.188
you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.

09:20.374 --> 09:22.876
What... are you wearing?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.961
I don't... I don't know.

09:25.029 --> 09:26.195
I mean, I found this

09:26.247 --> 09:28.131
at the lost and found
at the gym.

09:28.199 --> 09:31.384
I'm not really sure how sexy
a sex-cretary is supposed to be.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.003
I've never had
to do this.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.754
I've never had
to seduce somebody before.

09:34.839 --> 09:36.372
If you're gonna seduce me,

09:36.424 --> 09:39.175
don't dress up like
my aunt Frieda at Seder.

09:40.226 --> 09:41.394
Come on, okay?

09:41.479 --> 09:43.313
I will do anything,

09:44.030 --> 09:45.849
and I'll do it anywhere.

09:45.900 --> 09:46.733
All right?

09:48.603 --> 09:50.904
Even fantasy location...

09:51.988 --> 09:52.989
number three?

09:54.057 --> 09:55.025
Okay.

09:57.578 --> 10:00.697
Um, how good are the Beatles?

10:01.248 --> 10:02.582
Beatles are the best.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.400
Were you so upset
when they broke up?

10:04.952 --> 10:06.402
I would have been,
but I was one.

10:09.340 --> 10:11.691
Well, you're not one any more.

10:14.643 --> 10:15.645
How's your prostate?

10:15.696 --> 10:17.480
- Uh...
- I had my breast exam last week,

10:17.531 --> 10:18.915
and, like, they're fine.

10:19.483 --> 10:20.367
It's just boob in there,

10:20.451 --> 10:22.786
but we have to be careful.

10:22.837 --> 10:24.320
Our bodies are decaying.

10:25.072 --> 10:25.755
Are you okay?

10:25.823 --> 10:27.173
You seem strange.

10:27.258 --> 10:28.541
Why didn't we kiss
the other night?

10:28.626 --> 10:29.542
Sorry.

10:32.663 --> 10:33.930
I'm sorry.

10:33.998 --> 10:36.016
- No, it's fine.
- Oh.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.217
- What?
- Hey, I...

10:37.301 --> 10:39.185
- Is everything okay? Oh.
- I got to go.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.054
This ought to take care
of the dinner. - Yeah.

10:41.138 --> 10:43.840
Okay?

10:43.891 --> 10:45.275
Oh, I cannot believe
I almost left

10:45.342 --> 10:46.559
without, um...

10:46.644 --> 10:47.844
Here, there's cab fare.

10:47.895 --> 10:48.695
- Get home safe.
- Oh.

10:54.585 --> 10:55.869
Baby, look, I don't want space,
okay?

10:55.953 --> 10:57.370
I don't want anyone
to have space.

10:57.455 --> 10:59.239
I want to be standing
right in front of you.

10:59.323 --> 11:01.041
I want the air that you breathe

11:01.125 --> 11:03.410
to be the air coming directly
from out of my mouth.

11:03.494 --> 11:05.528
I want to just be passing air
back and forth

11:05.579 --> 11:07.630
between each other
until it's mostly carbon dioxide

11:07.698 --> 11:10.216
and then we both
pass out and die.

11:14.872 --> 11:16.056
No flights tonight.

11:16.123 --> 11:18.458
Hey, Schmidt, do you mind
if I borrow your car again?

11:18.526 --> 11:19.926
"Of course you can, Winston.
You're so great."

11:20.011 --> 11:21.227
Thank you!

Hey, my name's Nicholas.

11:41.020 --> 11:43.155
Nick, Nick.

11:43.222 --> 11:45.490
Buddy, nobody ever regretted
throwing an after party.

11:45.558 --> 11:46.775
Oh, I do.

11:46.859 --> 11:48.226
Dirk, I feel so old here.

11:48.277 --> 11:50.128
Is calling a girl "Shorty"
still cool?

11:50.196 --> 11:51.947
We just got to find your angle
with these college girls.

11:52.031 --> 11:54.499
Your hook, your panty-melter.

11:54.567 --> 11:57.185
Usually, my hook is that it's
closing time, and I'm there.

11:57.253 --> 11:59.171
You were a panty-melting
icon in law school.

11:59.238 --> 12:01.072
If panties were snowmen,

12:01.124 --> 12:03.542
you were March, bro.

12:06.312 --> 12:07.212
Hey.

12:07.263 --> 12:08.847
- Don't-don't do this.
- Skyler, Miriam,

12:08.914 --> 12:10.299
- come over here for a second.
- Don't humiliate me, Dirk.

12:10.383 --> 12:11.883
How cool is my friend, Nick?

12:11.934 --> 12:13.385
Are you a professor, too?

12:13.436 --> 12:14.686
No, no, no,
I'm a bartender.

12:14.754 --> 12:15.854
30 years old,

12:15.921 --> 12:17.389
I don't have health insurance.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.975
You know how to
make drinks?

12:20.059 --> 12:21.760
Panty-melter.

12:21.811 --> 12:23.895
Do I know how to make drinks,
did you say?

12:23.946 --> 12:25.697
Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?

12:25.765 --> 12:27.115
Yeah, I do that professionally.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.284
You could get me
drunk professionally?

12:29.352 --> 12:30.986
Are you a cop?

12:31.070 --> 12:32.170
Sometimes.

12:33.489 --> 12:34.373
Do you have identification
on you?

12:43.916 --> 12:44.833
I gotta call Jenna

12:44.834 --> 12:47.052
and tell her I'm making out
with a bartender.

12:47.119 --> 12:49.137
Five nights a week.

12:49.222 --> 12:52.457
Jess, you made it
to the party!

12:52.508 --> 12:54.342
What's going on?
Why is the cast

12:54.427 --> 12:56.011
of the <i>Social Network</i>
in our apartment?

12:56.095 --> 12:57.896
Dirk is a genius!

12:57.963 --> 13:00.399
20-year-old girls--
they think I'm awesome!

13:00.466 --> 13:02.017
And look at 'em!

13:02.101 --> 13:04.019
They don't know what
<i>Saved by the Bell</i> is

13:04.103 --> 13:05.353
and they've never felt pain.

13:06.438 --> 13:08.940
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!

13:08.991 --> 13:10.108
Can you believe it?

13:10.159 --> 13:11.493
Where's your Fancyman?
Where is he?

13:11.577 --> 13:13.495
I don't know.
It was horrible.

13:13.579 --> 13:16.815
He left and gave me
$100 for a cab!

13:16.866 --> 13:18.250
You know what?

13:18.317 --> 13:20.419
I'm gonna use
the remaining 90

13:20.486 --> 13:22.821
to get out of here
and start a new life.

13:22.872 --> 13:24.206
It's been nice
knowing you.

13:24.290 --> 13:27.092
Hey...!

13:27.159 --> 13:28.877
I'm gonna die alone!

13:28.961 --> 13:30.495
Oh, no!

13:30.546 --> 13:33.131
I am so, so sad
right now.

13:33.182 --> 13:35.851
My heart hurts!

13:35.935 --> 13:38.220
You want Nick to make you
a bayberry breeze?

13:38.304 --> 13:40.472
- 'Cause he is so smart.
- So smart.

13:40.523 --> 13:42.507
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

13:46.696 --> 13:48.613
This.

13:48.681 --> 13:51.616
I'm not happy! 30 sucks!

13:51.684 --> 13:54.569

14:07.917 --> 14:09.217
This is
officially crazy.

14:09.302 --> 14:10.719
Also, I have to go
to the bathroom.

14:10.803 --> 14:12.137
Just pee yourself.

14:12.204 --> 14:13.505
So you'd rather sit
in my urine

14:13.556 --> 14:14.973
for the rest of the car ride

14:14.975 --> 14:17.259
than admit to Winston
that we're sleeping together?

14:17.343 --> 14:20.061
Yep, absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.

14:20.146 --> 14:22.731
I don't want to ruin
what we have, okay?

14:22.815 --> 14:24.766
Because if people
find out,

14:24.851 --> 14:26.568
they're gonna have
a lot of questions,

14:26.652 --> 14:28.687
like, "Cece, why are
you sleeping with him?"

14:28.738 --> 14:31.439
And, "Seriously, why?"

14:31.524 --> 14:33.275
You think we have something
to ruin?

14:33.359 --> 14:35.827
Earlier, I was dressed
as a sex-cretary.

14:35.895 --> 14:38.947
And I was wearing shoulder pads.

14:39.031 --> 14:41.166
So I obviously

14:41.233 --> 14:43.368
must like sleeping with you.

14:44.504 --> 14:46.538
A secre-tarty.

14:46.589 --> 14:49.124
Shut... up.

14:52.411 --> 14:53.979
This is pretty great.

14:54.046 --> 14:55.447
I'm freezing.

14:55.515 --> 14:57.299
- Yeah.
- I'm so cold.

14:57.383 --> 14:59.217
How are you

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

15:29.748 --> 15:30.582
Shelby.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.083
Babe, I don't want space.

15:32.134 --> 15:33.501
Neither do I!

15:33.586 --> 15:35.837
That's why
I'm at your apartment.

15:35.922 --> 15:37.589
I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.307
What?!

15:39.392 --> 15:41.893
Babe, look, I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.

15:41.961 --> 15:43.011
Are you serious?

15:43.095 --> 15:44.062
I miss you, Shelby.

15:44.129 --> 15:45.463
You're so sexy, girl.

15:45.514 --> 15:47.632
In or out of the wig.

15:47.683 --> 15:49.651
I don't care. Shelby.

15:49.735 --> 15:51.636
You make me so feel brave, babe,

15:51.687 --> 15:53.738
and I've never felt like this
about anybody else before.

15:54.306 --> 15:55.640
I love you.

15:55.708 --> 15:59.194
And I carry your soul-song
with me wherever I go.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.645
I love you, too.

16:00.696 --> 16:02.647
I'm coming back, baby.
No space!

16:06.252 --> 16:08.286
Are you traveling with any
non-US citizens?

16:09.255 --> 16:11.707
You actually catch people
with that line?

16:12.792 --> 16:14.993
No, sir, just me
and my American heart...

16:16.044 --> 16:17.045
full of love.

16:19.215 --> 16:20.382
Then how do you explain...

16:22.466 --> 16:23.969
this?

16:25.688 --> 16:27.806
I can't... sir.

16:29.859 --> 16:33.328
No one in the entire world
can explain that.

16:35.693 --> 16:38.028
I am so tall!

16:38.862 --> 16:41.781
I feel like a Chinese
basketball player.

16:42.366 --> 16:44.167
Russell?

16:46.787 --> 16:47.403
Oh.

16:54.545 --> 16:56.046
Hey, Jess.

16:56.097 --> 16:57.714
I'm not Jess.

16:57.765 --> 17:01.101
I'm her cousin... Sylvia?

17:02.887 --> 17:04.137
Are you doing okay?

17:04.721 --> 17:06.271
I want a donut.

17:06.857 --> 17:10.093
Then let's get you a donut.

17:10.161 --> 17:11.861
Please?

17:11.929 --> 17:14.781
I want to talk
to you... alone.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.818
Well, this is
a fun group.

17:19.903 --> 17:21.404
Hmm. Can you drop me off
at my dorm?

17:21.454 --> 17:22.288
It's called Hamilton.

17:22.873 --> 17:24.958
I'd like to vomit now.

17:31.115 --> 17:33.783
God!

17:33.834 --> 17:36.302
I've never jumped out
of a moving car before!

17:36.387 --> 17:38.672
That was bad-ass!

17:38.756 --> 17:40.223
- Hey, uh, kiddo.
- Okay.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.807
- Nick, that's the road.
- What's up?

17:41.892 --> 17:42.726
You want the woods.

17:42.793 --> 17:44.144
I want the woods.
You're smart, Russ.

17:44.228 --> 17:45.679
- Come here.
- Hey, it was nothing.

17:45.763 --> 17:47.964
You're okay, Russ.

17:48.015 --> 17:51.101
Okay, we can hug
some more later.

17:51.152 --> 17:52.819
This isn't her, you know.

17:52.903 --> 17:54.487
She's not like us.

17:55.072 --> 17:56.790
She's one of the good ones.

17:58.409 --> 18:01.194
Time to make the
puke, Russell.

18:01.278 --> 18:02.946
So listen,
man, it's-it's really

18:02.997 --> 18:04.005
important to us

18:04.008 --> 18:06.149
that our completely equal
sexual relationship

18:06.200 --> 18:08.317
where neither one of us
has the upper hand,

18:08.369 --> 18:11.504
uh, remain a secret,
and while I respect

18:11.589 --> 18:13.923
the fact that you listen to
<i>Wicked</i> while you're alone,

18:13.991 --> 18:16.876
I could use that information
against you

18:16.961 --> 18:18.828
at any point
in time.

18:18.879 --> 18:20.380
By the way, there's a stop sign,
like, right up...

18:20.464 --> 18:21.798
Is that a stop sign?

18:21.866 --> 18:23.400
Well, you'd probably want
to slow down...

18:23.451 --> 18:25.035
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a go sign.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.653
I don't think
it's a go sign.

18:26.737 --> 18:28.822
Because if somebody like you

18:28.906 --> 18:31.708
is sleeping with
someone like her,

18:31.775 --> 18:33.910
then maybe the whole damn
world is upside down!

18:33.961 --> 18:35.745
It's just what
I'm thinking.

18:37.965 --> 18:39.299
And I want to
talk to you.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.000
I want to have a chance
to explain.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.752
That's okay. I understand.

18:42.803 --> 18:45.138
I just... I thought

18:45.222 --> 18:48.291
you wanted a sophisticated lady,
but now I realize that

18:48.342 --> 18:51.594
you like dating younger girls
'cause we think you're cool.

18:51.645 --> 18:52.896
And you know what?

18:52.963 --> 18:55.148
It's working because...

18:55.232 --> 18:57.734
I think you're a hotty
with a body.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.270
Oh. Um...

19:01.337 --> 19:03.239
I got to tell you,
I didn't ask you out

19:03.241 --> 19:04.290
because you're
younger than me.

19:04.292 --> 19:05.825
I asked you out
because I like you.

19:06.410 --> 19:10.497
But I-I've forgotten really
how... how to do this, you know.

19:10.581 --> 19:13.533
I haven't dated since 1989...

19:14.617 --> 19:17.353
when I took her to the
picture show in my buggy.

19:17.421 --> 19:20.957
1989 was, my friend,

19:21.008 --> 19:24.260
the year that I learned
to use the toaster by myself.

19:24.328 --> 19:26.596
Oh.

19:26.663 --> 19:28.882
The text I got at dinner
was from my ex-wife.

19:28.966 --> 19:30.266
Sarah's with her
this weekend,

19:30.334 --> 19:31.801
I didn't pack
her inhaler.

19:31.852 --> 19:33.069
She was having
an asthma attack.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.804
- Is Sarah okay?
- Yeah.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.273
Yeah. Thanks. I-I...

19:37.841 --> 19:39.893
I just feel like I
should have explained.

19:39.977 --> 19:41.511
And I really
wanted to kiss you

19:41.562 --> 19:43.346
- the other night.
- Really?

19:43.397 --> 19:45.398
I wanted to do <i>more</i>
than kiss you.

19:45.483 --> 19:47.183
I'd like to do you,
at some point.

19:47.234 --> 19:48.818
Like, you know, really,

19:48.869 --> 19:50.520
really give it to you good.

19:52.356 --> 19:54.541
Uh, but I've forgotten
how to tell

19:54.625 --> 19:57.060
whether it's the right moment.

19:57.128 --> 19:58.862
I was nervous.

19:58.929 --> 20:00.830
You were nervous?

20:00.881 --> 20:03.199
Nick was right.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.035
He can be really wise sometimes.

20:06.086 --> 20:07.754
Oh, my God,
it's happening!

20:07.838 --> 20:10.473
It's coming!
I think I'm dying!

20:10.541 --> 20:12.575
I feel scared
and excited!

20:16.146 --> 20:17.347
What do you think?

20:17.398 --> 20:19.265
What do I think of what?

20:19.350 --> 20:20.984
Do you think now
is the right moment?

20:21.051 --> 20:22.752
I think so.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.487
Okay.

20:24.555 --> 20:27.323
Get out of me, you poison!

20:30.077 --> 20:32.695
Wait. Is that your hand?

20:33.146 --> 20:34.497
No.

20:34.565 --> 20:35.915
That's <i>my</i> hand.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.067
- Oh, my God!
- You're welcome.

20:38.118 --> 20:40.203
Get out of here, Dirk!

20:40.254 --> 20:41.571
You get out of here...

20:41.622 --> 20:43.790
Come here.

20:49.763 --> 20:52.248
Hey!

20:52.299 --> 20:54.750
Oh, no!

20:54.802 --> 20:57.937
Where are you guys?

21:01.492 --> 21:02.859
Hello?

21:02.910 --> 21:04.227
Hey, where are you guys?

21:04.295 --> 21:06.579
Hey, could I have walked
out into the mountains?

21:06.664 --> 21:08.798
When does a hill
become a mountain?

21:08.866 --> 21:12.001
It just happened.

21:12.069 --> 21:13.536
I'm so cold.

21:13.587 --> 21:14.737
Who is this?

21:20.177 --> 21:23.412
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead!

21:23.464 --> 21:25.947
Dirk is dead!

21:28.664 --> 21:30.447
Greatest guy I knew.

21:30.449 --> 21:35.450
