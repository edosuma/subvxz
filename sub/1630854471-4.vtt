- This is the best of both worlds.

21:53.856 --> 21:55.357
We'll be 3,000 miles away

21:55.357 --> 21:58.068
while still getting the benefit
of the Chippendales' name.

21:58.068 --> 22:02.155
- I'm going to assume you
haven't told Steve this idea.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.490
- Well, not yet.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.450
DENISE:
Well, he's never gonna go for it.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.952
- Why not?

22:06.952 --> 22:09.913
DENISE: First of all,
the fact that it was your idea

22:09.913 --> 22:12.583
is gonna make him instantly suspicious.
[scoffs, blows raspberry]

22:12.583 --> 22:16.044
And then there's the fact that
you wouldn't be in his sight.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.046
The guy's a psycho control freak.

22:18.046 --> 22:22.009
He's not just going to hand over
the world's biggest city

22:22.009 --> 22:23.760
to somebody he deeply mistrusts.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.762
- Well, I, look,
I-I-I get why you're skeptical.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.807
I do, I do.
- And then there's the money, okay?

22:28.807 --> 22:31.476
Launching your own place,
it's so expensive,

22:31.476 --> 22:33.270
especially in New York City.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.063
Are you kidding? The overhead?

22:35.063 --> 22:37.983
- He won't have to take on
a drop of financial risk.

22:37.983 --> 22:41.069
All he has to do is just
sit there in his weird suit

22:41.069 --> 22:42.654
and watch the money roll in.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.948
- This is the coke talking.
You're making no sense.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.910
- Well, it does if you find a backer,
which it so happens,

22:47.910 --> 22:49.786
Denise, I have done.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.163
- A backer.

22:51.163 --> 22:54.958
NICK: Yes, in this case,
a very spoiled rich kid

22:54.958 --> 22:57.669
with a huge bank account.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.922
- All right,
you sexy animals, it's go time.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.089
- Hoo!

23:01.089 --> 23:03.008
- [chuckles] Yeah.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.426
- And a huger cock.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.471
Bradford Barton.

23:08.514 --> 23:10.891
This is real, a real plan.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.977
And I genuinely think I can get
Steve on board.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.813
- Okay, well, I have a alternative plan.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.107
Why don't you come back here

23:19.107 --> 23:22.611
and do your fucking job
so I don't have to?

23:22.611 --> 23:23.904
[phone slams]

23:23.904 --> 23:26.156
[phone tone]
- [clicks tongue] Fuck.

23:27.282 --> 23:30.118
[crowd cheering]

23:30.118 --> 23:31.703
LARRY:
How are you ladies?

23:31.703 --> 23:33.956
Are you ready to have
the greatest night of your lives?

23:33.956 --> 23:35.332
Make some noise!

23:37.626 --> 23:39.086
- Welcome to Chippendales!

23:39.086 --> 23:40.587
Who's ready to party?

23:40.587 --> 23:44.049
[crowd cheering]
- Here he is, ladies,

23:44.049 --> 23:47.302
your luscious chocolate fantasy
come to life.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.930
The freakiest freak this side of Harlem,

23:49.930 --> 23:54.101
the brother like no other,
the pimp who'll make you limp,

23:54.101 --> 23:55.894
the daddy with a Caddy.

23:55.894 --> 23:59.147
All the ladies, give it up for Otis!

23:59.147 --> 24:03.861
["Super Freak" by Rick James playing]
[crowd cheering]

24:03.861 --> 24:06.071
Gosh, I wish I could do what he does.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.908
Ladies, take this night to the top.

24:11.201 --> 24:14.121
Anytime someone shows up
in a purple-colored hat,

24:14.121 --> 24:16.874
you know it's gonna get freaky up in here.

24:16.874 --> 24:18.625
Come on, make some noise.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.377
[crowd cheering]

24:20.377 --> 24:22.838
Oh, I like that slow gyration.

24:22.838 --> 24:26.466
One, two, skip a few,
right to the sexy time.

24:28.218 --> 24:31.138
I've seen a few of those in my own mirror.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.891
- Okay, here you go. Have a good night.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.143
LARRY: And here comes
two half-naked friends

24:36.143 --> 24:39.479
willing to take things up a notch.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.316
Couple turns, and there goes the coat.

24:42.316 --> 24:43.400
Just in time.

24:45.027 --> 24:46.403
Touch yourself if you want

24:46.403 --> 24:49.239
but if you want a taste,
that's gonna cost ya.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.533
All these men... Oh, my God!

24:51.533 --> 24:52.993
Look at those butt cheeks!

24:52.993 --> 24:55.412
You knew it was coming.
Don't act surprised.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.289
How about a brush to the face,
table for one.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.666
- Steve, people are loving
these calendars.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.043
- That's amazing.

25:01.043 --> 25:03.420
Women love to know what date it is
and naked men.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.130
I have to tell you something,
come upstairs with me.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.090
- Okay.
Hey, Doug, can you take over?

25:07.090 --> 25:08.675
- Got it.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.678
LARRY: And now you
have the stories to share.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.888
STEVE: Come, come.

25:12.888 --> 25:13.764
- Okay.

25:14.515 --> 25:15.682
Steve?

25:15.682 --> 25:16.934
- Come, come. There's--

25:16.934 --> 25:19.937
- Oh, where were you?
- Come sit here. Sit down.

25:21.647 --> 25:24.441
I have some very exciting news.
- Okay.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.485
- You know that printing press
that makes our calendars?

25:26.485 --> 25:27.819
- Yes.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.821
- I bought it. [chuckles]

25:29.821 --> 25:31.114
- You bought it?
- Uh-huh.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.783
- They weren't making
the calendars fast enough

25:32.783 --> 25:37.037
because they have other customers
and so I addressed the problem.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.247
- Was it for sale, Steve?

25:38.247 --> 25:40.040
- No.
- Then how did you buy it?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.124
- You know that film "The Godfather"?

25:41.124 --> 25:42.376
- Mm-hmm.
- In it there's a character,

25:42.376 --> 25:43.669
he's one of the gangsters, he says,

25:43.669 --> 25:46.296
"I made him an offer he can't refuse."

25:46.296 --> 25:47.172
I did that.

25:48.674 --> 25:50.509
That's what I did.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.302
- Steve, how much did you spend?

25:52.302 --> 25:54.429
- It doesn't matter.
- It absolutely matters.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.139
The club's finances are my department

25:56.139 --> 25:58.851
and you made a massive purchase
without even consulting me.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.185
- I have big plans for the calendars.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.354
I want to go national starting next year.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.981
And with our own printing press,

26:03.981 --> 26:05.649
we'll be able to print as
many calendars as we want.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.193
In business, that's known as controlling
the means of production.

26:08.193 --> 26:11.321
- Steve, I didn't run the numbers.
- I ran the numbers.

26:11.321 --> 26:13.824
It works, it's really good.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.159
I am a king. You are my queen.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.623
LARRY:
Grab your hair and pull yourself

26:21.623 --> 26:24.126

the middle of the stage!

26:24.126 --> 26:27.171
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great and powerful Otis!

26:27.171 --> 26:29.298
Make some noise!

26:29.298 --> 26:34.261
[crowd cheering]

26:36.638 --> 26:38.515
This is the man that you come for.

26:38.515 --> 26:42.186
Are you not having the time of your life?

26:42.186 --> 26:43.937
All night long.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.064
You show the money,
he'll show you the moves.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.566
That's how it works.
- Thanks. Yeah.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.735
LARRY:
One more time for Otis, everybody!

26:49.735 --> 26:51.361
There he goes.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.822
Ladies, I hope you brought a towel
and a change of panties.

26:53.822 --> 26:54.948
OTIS: Shit.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.285
- Almost there. Here we go.
[restaurant patrons chattering]

26:58.285 --> 27:01.997
Three, two, one.

27:02.414 --> 27:04.583
Do you know where you are?

27:04.583 --> 27:06.627
- Um, a...

27:08.337 --> 27:09.338
a restaurant?

27:09.338 --> 27:10.672
- Not just any restaurant.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.799
The Palisade Club.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.219
- Oh.
- [gasps] It's the hottest spot in town.

27:15.219 --> 27:18.388
All the celebrities come here
to see and be seen.

27:18.388 --> 27:21.266
Warren Beatty, Natalie Wood, Gil Gerard.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.019
- May I help you.
- Table for two, please.

27:25.229 --> 27:26.480
- Do you have a reservation?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.315
- I do not.

27:28.315 --> 27:30.651
It's time we started acting the part.

27:30.651 --> 27:32.194
- [scoffs] The part of what?

27:32.194 --> 27:34.363
- The fantastically
successful people we are.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.573
We have one of the hottest
night clubs in the city,

27:36.573 --> 27:38.992
a top-selling calendar, and as of today,

27:38.992 --> 27:40.327
a printing press capable of--

27:40.327 --> 27:44.498
- I'm sorry. It seems we
have nothing available.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.417
- Oh, what about that one over there?

27:47.417 --> 27:50.087
- Oh, that's for parties of four.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.422
- Okay.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.092
Oh, what about this one right here?

27:55.092 --> 27:57.052
Uh, that one is reserved for members.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.720
- Members?
- My usual table.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.640
- Oh, how do I get one of those?

28:01.640 --> 28:05.352
- Well, [chuckles] there is a process.

28:05.352 --> 28:08.063
- A process?
- You have to apply.

28:08.063 --> 28:10.440
- Great, may I please have an application?

28:10.440 --> 28:12.985
- It's not quite so d...

28:12.985 --> 28:15.612
You need a member to sponsor you.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.866
Is that so?
- Let's just go someplace else.

28:18.866 --> 28:21.326
- No, I want to eat here.

28:21.326 --> 28:24.454
Unless for some reason
we are not welcome here.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.123
- Sir?

28:26.123 --> 28:27.541
- I wonder do any of your members

28:27.541 --> 28:28.917
happen to have brown skin?

28:28.917 --> 28:30.252
Because from the looks of it--

28:30.252 --> 28:33.338
- I assure you, this club
welcomes people of all--

28:33.338 --> 28:34.298
- Oh, you can assure me?

28:34.298 --> 28:35.799
You know what you can do with
your membership application?

28:35.799 --> 28:37.467

shove it up your ass!

synchronize and it's, uh, good.

the past few weeks.

I've been out in New York
meeting with investors,

top Broadway guys and guess what?

31:07.451 --> 31:10.245

31:17.836 --> 31:21.006
[chuckles] So, ahem...

31:23.091 --> 31:26.011
Basically the way I see it,
you've got two choices:

31:26.011 --> 31:31.058
You and me stick together
and take the Big Apple by storm,

31:31.058 --> 31:35.854
or... you and me go to war.

31:35.854 --> 31:39.316

I take my talent and my vision,

31:39.316 --> 31:41.610
not to mention
half the dancers in this club,

31:41.610 --> 31:45.656
and I become your biggest competitor
and worst nightmare.

31:45.656 --> 31:47.824
It will be ugly, Steve.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.493
Blood will spill.

31:49.493 --> 31:52.246

Those are your choices.
