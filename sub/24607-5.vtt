WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.828
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.872 --> 00:04.221
RAVEN: MEET ELIGIUS 4.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.310
BELLAMY: "NO INMATES
PAST THIS POINT."

00:06.354 --> 00:07.529
CRYOSLEEP.

00:07.572 --> 00:08.878
MURPHY: MEANS THE PRISONERS
ARE STILL HERE.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.140
ECHO: THIS IS AN ARMY.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.360
CAN YOU RIG IT SO WE
CAN KILL THEM REMOTELY?

00:12.403 --> 00:13.665
-LEVERAGE.

00:13.709 --> 00:14.797
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.277
WE NEED YOUR HELP
OPENING A BUNKER.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.453
IF YOU DO THAT,
I'LL LET YOUR PEOPLE GO.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.498
DIYOZA: THERE'S A DOCTOR
IN THAT BUNKER.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.499
WE GRAB THE DOCTOR.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.675
WE GO HOME
AND FIND A CURE.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.155
WE'LL COME
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.852
-THE TWO OF US.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.028
THOSE ARE MY TERMS.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.072
DIYOZA: HERE ARE MY TERMS.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.552
THE VALLEY IS OURS.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.075
AS LONG AS YOU STAY HERE,

00:32.119 --> 00:33.511
WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.773
LET'S GO.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.514
YAAH!

00:37.559 --> 00:38.908
DIYOZA: GET TO THE SHIP!

00:39.865 --> 00:40.866
SHAW: WE'RE AT WAR.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.085
DIYOZA: GO MISSILES HOT.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.522
ONE INTO THE CROWD,
ONE INTO THE BUNKER.

00:44.566 --> 00:45.871
-IT'S JAMMED.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.351
-HAS TO BE.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.439
LET'S GO GET HER.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.702
MILLER: BLODREINA...
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

00:50.746 --> 00:52.617
NOW WE GO TO WAR.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.061
JACKSON:
COULD'VE USED YOU
IN THE BUNKER, CLARKE.

01:03.628 --> 01:04.977
YOU HAD MY MOTHER.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.461
WHY WAS SHE AFRAID?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.074
JACKSON. HEY.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.772
PLEASE HELP ME
TO UNDERSTAND

01:16.815 --> 01:18.904
WHAT HAPPENED
DOWN THERE.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.602
JACKSON.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.994
HEY.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.433
BE SAFE, OK?

01:29.001 --> 01:30.307
MILLER.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.181
MILLER.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.098
MILLER.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.456
MILLER, WAIT.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.155
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SLOW DOWN.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.809
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:53.852 --> 01:55.027
WISH I COULD
TELL YOU, BELLAMY.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.464
OCTAVIA TOLD YOU
NOT TO?

01:59.510 --> 02:01.251
THEY'RE GOING
TO SHALLOW VALLEY.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.733
CLARKE. CLARKE!

02:07.214 --> 02:08.780
YOU CAN'T JUST DO
WHATEVER THE HELL
YOU WANT HERE.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.913
I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE MOVING
AHEAD OF THE ARMY,

02:10.956 --> 02:12.393
TO SCOUT
FORWARD TERRAIN.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.003
WHICH ROUTE
ARE YOU TAKING?

02:15.047 --> 02:17.180
IT'S SANDSTORM
SEASON.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.356
THE WIND MOVES
IN A PREDICTABLE PATH.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.011
I'VE MADE THE TRIP
DOZENS OF TIMES.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.709
TRUST ME.
YOU NEED MY HELP.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.191
OCTAVIA: THEY DON'T
KNOW WE'RE COMING,

02:28.235 --> 02:31.020
SO ALL 3 NORTHERN PASSES
WILL BE WIDE OPEN.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.065
BUT THE VILLAGE
WILL BE FORTIFIED.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.937
WHERE'S THE WATER SOURCE?

02:34.980 --> 02:37.679
-HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

02:37.722 --> 02:39.028
MY QUESTION EXACTLY.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.508
COOPER: MILLER,
YOUR ORDERS WERE TO GO--

02:40.551 --> 02:42.727
I KNOW MY ORDERS.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.686
I THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN
TO WHAT CLARKE HAS TO SAY.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.428
YOU CAN'T TAKE
THE SEA ROUTE.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.081
INDRA: WHY? YOU SAID
THE SEA IS GONE.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.387
IS IT PASSABLE
OR NOT?

02:50.431 --> 02:52.346
YES, MAYBE.
BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND--

02:52.389 --> 02:53.695
MAYBE'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.262
-LET'S MOVE OUT.
-O.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.180
STAND DOWN.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.228
PLEASE, O,
JUST HEAR US OUT.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.578
CLARKE: OCTAVIA,
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.711
NO ONE WANTS TO GET
TO THAT VALLEY

03:09.754 --> 03:10.886
MORE THAN ME.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.714
IT'S MY HOME.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.498
BUT THIS WAY
IS TOO RISKY.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.370
RISKY HOW?

03:16.413 --> 03:17.632
SHOW ME.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.724
YOU CHOSE
THE SHORTEST ROUTE,

03:22.767 --> 03:23.899
WHICH MAKES SENSE,

03:23.942 --> 03:25.292
BUT THE DRY SEABED
IS HIT BY

03:25.335 --> 03:27.250
ALMOST CONSTANT
SANDSTORMS.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.817
OCTAVIA: WE HAVE THE TENTS
FROM THE SECOND DAWN.

03:28.860 --> 03:29.948
SAND WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.211
CLARKE: IT'S NOT
JUST SAND.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.213
SOME OF IT CRYSTALLIZED
IN PRAIMFAYA.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.084
I'M TALKING
SHARDS OF GLASS

03:35.127 --> 03:37.434
LIKE RAZOR BLADES.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.827
YOUR TENTS WILL
BE TORN TO SHREDS

03:38.870 --> 03:40.002
AND SO WILL YOU.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.351
COOPER: BLODREINA IS RIGHT.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.962
BESIDES, WE CAN ONLY
CARRY RATIONS FOR 7 DAYS.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.051
THE SEA ROUTE WILL TAKE 6.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.271
THE NEXT SHORTEST PATH
ADDS 50 MILES.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.751
THAT'S TWO DAYS IF WE'RE LUCKY.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.014
INDRA: HOW DO WE KNOW
THERE WON'T BE SANDSTORMS

03:52.057 --> 03:53.407
ON THE LONGER ROUTES?

03:53.450 --> 03:56.410
ENOUGH.
WE'RE DOING THIS.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.412
THE HYDROFARM IS BARELY
FEEDING US NOW,

03:58.455 --> 04:01.763
SO IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

04:01.806 --> 04:03.112
THEN IT SHOULD BE OURS.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.157
DIYOZA THINKS
THE SAME THING.

04:06.724 --> 04:07.856
AND SO WE FIGHT.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.086
INDRA: YOUR SISTER
NEEDS YOU, BELLAMY.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.132
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE FOR HER.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.532
THERE ARE PACKS WITH RATIONS
HERE BY THE DOOR.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.449
FIRST BATTALION!
MOUNT UP!

04:35.492 --> 04:37.277
AM I CRAZY OR WERE
THEY GONNA KILL ME

04:37.320 --> 04:38.626
FOR GETTING
IN HER WAY?

04:42.586 --> 04:44.022
WHAT DO WE DO?

04:44.066 --> 04:45.763
RAVEN AND MURPHY
ARE IN TROUBLE.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.722
I HAVE TO GO
WITH THEM.

04:47.765 --> 04:52.074
6-DAY HIKE THROUGH
SANDSTORM COUNTRY

04:52.117 --> 04:53.989
WITH A GLADIATOR
CULT.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.382
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

04:57.514 --> 04:58.646
AFTER YOU.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.497
THEY'RE GOING ON FOOT?
ARE THEY CRAZY?

05:24.715 --> 05:27.370
IT'S 150 MILES
ACROSS THAT DESERT.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.894
DIYOZA: NO, LIEUTENANT,
THEY'RE NOT CRAZY.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.722
THEY'RE FANATICAL.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.377
AND FANATICS MAKE
GOOD SOLDIERS.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.900
MCCREARY: I SAY
WE LET THEM COME.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.165
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WOULD DO?

05:40.209 --> 05:41.906
WAIT TO FIGHT THEM HERE?

05:41.950 --> 05:44.518
WAGE WAR ON THE ONE
PLACE LEFT ON THE PLANET

05:44.561 --> 05:46.258
THAT CAN SUSTAIN LIFE?

05:46.302 --> 05:49.218
WE'VE ALREADY GOT 4
HOSTILES IN THESE WOODS.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.002
5 IF YOU COUNT
THE CHILD THAT CLARKE

05:51.046 --> 05:52.743
WAS SO DESPERATE
TO PROTECT.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.267
YOU REALLY WANT TO LET
ANOTHER 50 IN?

05:55.311 --> 05:58.793
MOTIVATED, DISCIPLINED
SOLDIERS.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.753
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.

06:02.797 --> 06:03.928
YES.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.715
GET MY MISSILE SYSTEM
BACK ON LINE.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.586
IF THIS RAVEN THAT
YOU'RE SO IMPRESSED BY

06:09.630 --> 06:11.414
WON'T TELL YOU HOW
SHE LOCKED US OUT,

06:11.458 --> 06:13.024
USE MCCREARY.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.591
AT LEAST HE'S GOOD
FOR SOMETHING.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.944
YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT
WAS ALL I WAS GOOD FOR

06:19.988 --> 06:22.382
BACK ON THE ROCK.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.776
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.
THAT WAS TORTURE, TOO.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.952
SHAW, GET ME
THOSE DAMN MISSILES.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.526
[INDISTINCT CHATTER
IN DISTANCE]

07:24.879 --> 07:27.011
[INDISTINCT CHATTER,
DEATH METAL MUSIC PLAYING]

07:52.123 --> 07:53.777
YOU'RE NOT SAFE.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.696
THERE'S AN ARMY ON THE MARCH
TOWARD US RIGHT NOW.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.091
AN ARMY WHO'S WILLING
TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH

08:03.134 --> 08:07.748
FOR THIS MIRACULOUS PLACE THAT
YOU'VE BEEN IN FOR TWO HOURS

08:07.791 --> 08:09.706
AND ARE ALREADY DESECRATING.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.884
I SAID I'D GET YOU HOME,
AND I DID.

08:13.928 --> 08:18.019
IT MAY NOT BE THE HOME THAT
WE EXPECTED, BUT WE'RE HERE.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.152
AND WE'RE FREE.

08:23.024 --> 08:26.593
YOU HAVE ONE DAY TO GET USED
TO YOUR NEW REALITY.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.118
WE START YOUR TRAINING
IN THE MORNING.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.821
FOR GOD'S SAKE, PLAY SOMETHING
WITH A BEAT.

08:39.693 --> 08:43.218
VINSON...COME WITH ME.

08:54.838 --> 08:55.839
HUH.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.363
WONKRU HAS NO IDEA
SHE HAS MISSILES.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.017
OCTAVIA'S GONNA
GET THEM ALL KILLED.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.849
ABBY...

09:07.198 --> 09:08.635
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

09:08.678 --> 09:11.115
CLARKE DREW THIS.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.943
THIS IS WHERE
SHE LIVED.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.118
WHO IS THAT?

09:16.033 --> 09:17.252
I DON'T KNOW.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.650
TWO BEDS.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.565
LOOKS LIKE
SHE WASN'T ALONE.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.014
THIS WAS
MY DAUGHTER'S HOUSE?

09:40.057 --> 09:41.842
DIYOZA: YES.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.148
NOW IT CAN BE YOURS
AS LONG AS YOU'RE LOYAL

09:44.192 --> 09:45.410
AND USEFUL.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.021
-WE'VE NEEDED A DOCTOR

09:47.064 --> 09:49.589
EVER SINCE OUR SHIP'S
PHYSICIAN WAS KILLED.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.505
VINSON HERE IS
YOUR FIRST PATIENT.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.725
VINSON: IT'S A PRIVILEGE
TO MEET YOU BOTH.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.208
IF HE'S WITH YOU,
WHY THE COLLAR?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.644
SOME OF US STILL
HAVE TROUBLE

10:01.688 --> 10:04.908
CONTROLLING OUR MORE...
PRIMAL URGES.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.956
I'M GENERALLY
A PLEASANT PERSON.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.829
IF THE DEMON
COMES OUT,

10:12.873 --> 10:14.309
YOU PULL
THAT TRIGGER.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.102
DIYOZA: I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO IT THEN.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.019
WAIT, UH...

10:29.063 --> 10:31.239
WHEN WE CAME ABOARD,
I HAD A BAG.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.721
IT HAS MEDICAL SUPPLIES
IN IT.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.244
I'M GONNA NEED THAT.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.768
DIYOZA: YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED RIGHT HERE.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.423
DIAGNOSE AND TREAT VINSON.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.338
THEN WE CAN TALK
ABOUT YOUR PILLS.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.951
SO WE'RE
PRISONERS THEN.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.170
DIYOZA:
YOU APPROACHED ME.

10:49.213 --> 10:52.390
WHY DON'T WE CALL IT
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.565
KANE: WHAT ABOUT
JOHN MURPHY?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.045
RAVEN REYES?

10:55.089 --> 10:56.830
WE KNOW YOU
PICKED THEM UP
FROM THE MOTHERSHIP.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.832
WE NEED GUARANTEES
THAT NO HARM WILL
COME TO THEM,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.311
OR WE WON'T
HELP YOU.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.100
DO YOU HAVE
SOME HIDDEN TALENT
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.450
I KNOW YOU NEED
INTEL ON OCTAVIA.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.365
WHAT SHE'S
CAPABLE OF.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.149
HOW MANY GUNS
SHE HAS.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.368
HOW MANY FIGHTERS.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.293
I DON'T
TRUST TRAITORS.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.993
VINSON...PUT
THE SCALPEL DOWN.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.267
DIYOZA: KEEP YOUR HANDS AND FEET
AWAY FROM HIS MOUTH

11:43.311 --> 11:44.704
AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

11:58.195 --> 12:01.111
WE HONOR THOSE WHO DIED
SO WE MIGHT LIVE.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.341
ALL: OMON GON OSON.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.564
CLARKE: "ALL OF ME
FOR ALL OF US."

12:19.608 --> 12:21.871
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.351
BELLAMY: HOW SO?

12:23.394 --> 12:25.396
THEY LOST
400 PEOPLE.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.573
IT'S A THIRD OF EVERYONE
IN THAT BUNKER.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.792
AND THEY HAD NO IDEA

12:29.836 --> 12:31.751
IF THEY'D EVER
GET OUT.

12:31.794 --> 12:35.972
YET LOOK AT THEM--
STRONG, UNIFIED.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.367
I CAN SEE WHY MY MOM
WAS TERRIFIED,

12:39.410 --> 12:41.717
BUT YOU
GOTTA ADMIT--

12:41.761 --> 12:43.284
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.419
SO IS SURVIVING ALONE.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.382
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

12:56.558 --> 12:57.994
WELL, I WASN'T ALONE.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.390
I HAD MADI.

13:05.045 --> 13:08.091
I'M TIRED.
YOU CAN HAVE THE REST
OF MY RATIONS.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.442
OMON GON OSON.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.053
RIGHT.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.932
MONTY, COME IN.
DO YOU READ ME?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.198
INDRA: YOUR BROTHER
LOVES YOU, OCTAVIA.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.115
LOVE IS WEAKNESS.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.291
GAIA'S TEACHINGS,
NO DOUBT.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.294
I HOPED SHE WAS BEYOND
SUCH NONSENSE.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.688
IT ISN'T NONSENSE.

13:39.731 --> 13:43.518
LOVE NO ONE...
AND NO ONE CAN HURT YOU.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.174
I LOVE YOU.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.265
DOES THAT
MAKE ME WEAK?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.009
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT
TO YOU, SEDA.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.849
COME ON, MONTY.
DO YOU READ ME?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.506
-HELP!
-WE NEED HELP!

14:15.550 --> 14:17.508
INDRA: IT'S THE SCOUTS.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.814
MILLER, WHAT IS IT?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.817
MEDIC! WE NEED HELP!
IT'S OBIKA!

14:21.861 --> 14:22.862
I'LL GET
THE MED KIT.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.211
MILLER: PLEASE HELP US!

14:25.516 --> 14:27.127
-HE NEEDS HELP!

14:27.170 --> 14:28.868
MILLER: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG!

14:30.217 --> 14:32.523
MILLER: PLEASE! HURRY!
SOMEONE HELP HIM!

14:34.743 --> 14:36.788
OUT OF MY WAY.
I CAN HELP.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.138
NOT YOU.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.973
CLARKE: OCTAVIA.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.889
LET HER IN.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.937
HE'S ALIVE, BUT
HIS HEART'S RACING.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED OUT THERE?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.071
MILLER: WE SEPARATED
TO COVER MORE GROUND.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.029
THEN I HEAR HIM SCREAMING OUT
THAT THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.161
THEN I GET TO HIM
AND THERE'S NOTHING.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.597
IT'S JUST MORE SCREAMING AND--

15:07.994 --> 15:09.604
THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE HIM.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.046
MILLER: HURRY!
GET HIM IN THE TENT.
GET HIM IN THE TENT.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.743
-NOBODY ELSE COMES INSIDE.
-MOVE!

15:18.787 --> 15:20.528
MILLER: RIGHT HERE.
PUT HIM ON THE TABLE.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.312
CLARKE: HELP ME
GET HIS JACKET OFF.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.053
INDRA: CLARKE,
WHAT IS THIS?

15:24.097 --> 15:25.620
I DON'T KNOW.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.535
MILLER, TELL US
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.623
NOTHING HAPPENED.
WE STOPPED TO EAT.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.798
THEN WE SEPARATED AGAIN.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.321
NEXT THING I KNEW,
HE WAS SCREAMING.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.193
YOUR RATIONS.
SHOW ME.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.629
NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH OUR RATIONS.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.196
HE WAS EATING
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.371
COOPER'S RIGHT.
IF IT WAS THE RATIONS,

15:37.414 --> 15:38.589
MILLER WOULD HAVE IT, TOO.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.808
THEY SHARE EVERYTHING.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.244
WELL, IT GOT
IN HIM SOMEHOW.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.637
WAIT.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.990
LOOK.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.516
IT CAME FROM THE SAND.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.693
WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.304
NO.
-OCTAVIA,

15:57.347 --> 15:59.001
HE TOLD MILLER THAT
THEY WERE EVERYWHERE.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.134
YES, BUT MILLER JUST
SAID HE SAW NOTHING.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.223
COOPER: EVERYWHERE COULD MEAN
EVERYWHERE INSIDE HIM.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.311
I AGREE
WITH BLODREINA.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.703
WHAT A SURPRISE.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.143
WE MARCH ON AT FIRST LIGHT.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.535
AND OBIKA?

16:13.885 --> 16:15.887
IF HE'S NOT BETTER
BY THEN...

16:20.544 --> 16:22.503
I'LL END HIS PAIN MYSELF.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.519
SHE'S TOUGHER
THAN SHE LOOKS.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.917
SHAW: RAVEN...

16:48.485 --> 16:50.444
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.924
YOU CAN TORTURE ME
ALL YOU WANT.

16:52.968 --> 16:57.407
MY ANSWER WON'T CHANGE.
I DIDN'T DO IT!

16:57.451 --> 16:58.974
STOP LYING!

17:01.194 --> 17:03.109
[SNIFFLING,
CRYING]

17:17.210 --> 17:20.169
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS...

17:20.213 --> 17:22.389
IF I PUSH
THIS BUTTON...

17:22.432 --> 17:23.868
WHEN YOU'RE WET?

17:26.697 --> 17:28.960
I DON'T, EITHER.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.093
BUT IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME RIGHT NOW

17:31.137 --> 17:33.226
HOW TO GET BACK
INTO OUR MISSILES...

17:33.269 --> 17:34.705
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

17:36.751 --> 17:37.708
JUST LET ME TALK
TO HER ALONE,

17:37.752 --> 17:39.101
AND I'LL GET IT
OUT OF HER.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.721
MCCREARY: BRING HIM IN.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.253
RAVEN: NO, PLEASE! STOP!

18:00.296 --> 18:02.516
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! STOP!

18:04.300 --> 18:06.998
NOW...WHICH ONE OF YOU

18:07.042 --> 18:10.828
KILLED MY GOOD FRIEND KODIAK
ON THE MOTHERSHIP?

18:10.872 --> 18:12.178
MCCREARY, JUST
BACK THE HELL UP.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.137
YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS

18:15.181 --> 18:18.967
TO TELL ME HOW TO
UNLOCK THOSE MISSILES. ONE.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.882
-MCCREARY.
-I DON'T KNOW.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.145
-TWO.
-PLEASE! I SWEAR TO GOD!

18:23.189 --> 18:26.279
-I DIDN'T DO IT!
-THREE.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.281
FOUR!

18:28.324 --> 18:30.196
PUT DOWN THE KNIFE.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.332
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.118
YEAH? WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.774
NOW GET OUT.
ALL OF YOU.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.996
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO KILL YOU...

18:49.084 --> 18:51.173
BUT YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR LEGS TO FLY.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.049
LET'S GO.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.240
DON'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.287
SHE COULDN'T EVEN IF
SHE WANTED TO.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.289
I'M THE ONE WHO LOCKED
THE WEAPONS SYSTEM.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.648
SHAW: DIYOZA WAS FREAKED OUT
BY WHAT SHE SAW IN THE BUNKER.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.738
AND AFTER WE OPENED FIRE,
SHE KNEW WE WERE AT WAR.

19:34.782 --> 19:37.001
SO IF I DIDN'T SAY YOU HACKED
THE MISSILE SYSTEM,

19:37.045 --> 19:38.742
SHE WOULD'VE ENDED IT
RIGHT THEN AND THERE,

19:38.786 --> 19:40.222
AND THEY'D ALL BE DEAD.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.746
SO YOU LET THEM
TORTURE US FOR NOTHING.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.313
IT WASN'T
FOR NOTHING.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.186
IT WAS TO SAVE
HIS OWN ASS.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.625
I'M SORRY.
WERE YOU LOOKING
FOR A "THANK YOU"?

19:52.974 --> 19:54.323
YOU LET THEM
DO THIS TO US

19:54.367 --> 19:55.759
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENS TO YOU

19:55.803 --> 19:56.978
IF THEY FIND OUT
THE TRUTH.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.327
MURPHY: NO, HEY, RAVEN.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.546
COME ON.
HE DID JUST SAVE MY LIFE.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.635
THE LEAST WE COULD DO
IS HEAR HIM OUT.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.376
I MEAN, I AM ASSUMING
YOU HAVE A PLAN

20:03.419 --> 20:05.421
TO GET US OUT
OF THIS, CORRECT?

20:05.465 --> 20:06.814
YEAH.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.772
I TELL THEM
SHE CAME CLEAN,

20:08.816 --> 20:10.774
THEN UNLOCK THE MISSILES.

20:10.818 --> 20:11.949
THAT PLAN SUCKS.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.255
IF THE ALTERNATIVE
IS MORE TORTURE,

20:13.299 --> 20:14.430
I THINK WE SHOULD
AT LEAST CONSIDER

20:14.474 --> 20:15.692
LETTING HIM
SAVE HIS ASS.

20:15.736 --> 20:16.824
SHE'LL USE
THE MISSILES.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.478
SHAW: YEAH.
SHE WILL.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.131
THERE'S AN ARMY
FROM THAT BUNKER

20:20.175 --> 20:21.785
ON THEIR WAY HERE
RIGHT NOW.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.266
EITHER I TELL THEM
YOU HELPED ME GET BACK IN,

20:24.310 --> 20:25.833
OR I SAY THAT
I HACKED IN MYSELF,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.269
BUT ONE OF
THOSE OPTIONS

20:27.313 --> 20:29.619
HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT
OF YOU TWO STAYING ALIVE.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.186
WELL, THEN, THAT'S
THE OPTION WE CHOOSE.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.535
RAVEN: NO.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.234
IT ISN'T.

20:39.455 --> 20:42.153
I SAW YOU ON
THE CAPTAIN'S LOG.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.981
DIYOZA KEPT YOU
ALIVE TO FLY
THE SHIP,

20:44.025 --> 20:45.853
BUT YOU'RE
NOT ONE OF THEM.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.985
THAT'S WHY YOU LIED
ABOUT BEING

20:48.029 --> 20:49.291
LOCKED OUT OF
THE MISSILES,

20:49.335 --> 20:51.206
AND THAT'S WHY

20:51.250 --> 20:53.861
YOU'RE GONNA
HELP US NOW.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.341
TRUST ME, MURPHY.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.346
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
MY PLAN MORE.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.618
YOU NEED TO REST.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.883
NO, I NEED TO KEEP WORKING
WHILE I STILL CAN.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.368
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOU.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.718
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.244
IT'S OK.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.247
IT'S NOT OK.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.902
NO.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.516
I ALMOST GOT YOU KILLED
IN THE ARENA.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.302
YOU HAD TO KILL SOMEONE
BECAUSE OF ME.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.309
AM I INTERRUPTING?

21:53.486 --> 21:54.574
JUST TELL ME WHAT
I NEED TO KNOW,

21:54.617 --> 21:56.619
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR SHAKES

21:56.663 --> 21:57.794
AND VOMITING.

22:01.058 --> 22:04.714
VINSON HAS
PULMONARY TUMEFACTION,

22:04.758 --> 22:07.456
MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY
WHATEVER YOU WERE MINING.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.286
AND THAT PRESENTS ITSELF
WITH--WITH BLACK SPOTS.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.723
-IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

22:13.767 --> 22:15.551
WITHOUT A BIOPSY.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.510
AND IF IT'S CANCER,
THEN THE PROGNOSIS IS--

22:17.553 --> 22:20.382
IT'S NOT CANCER.
13 MORE PATIENTS,

22:20.426 --> 22:22.297
ALL WITH
SIMILAR SYMPTOMS.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.127
YOU'LL ALSO
FIND THE RESULTS

22:26.170 --> 22:28.129
OF THE PREVIOUS
PHYSICIAN'S BIOPSIES.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.565
HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT WAS,

22:29.609 --> 22:31.393
SO PAXTON MCCREARY
SLIT HIS THROAT.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.742
KANE: YOU WERE
TESTING HER?

22:34.091 --> 22:36.137
WE DON'T JUST
NEED A DOCTOR.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.878
WE NEED
A GOOD DOCTOR.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.447
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GET TO STAY.

22:41.490 --> 22:44.101
KEEP BEING USEFUL,
AND SO DOES HE.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.712
THERE ARE OTHERS
LIKE HER

22:45.755 --> 22:47.888
IN THAT BUNKER.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.412
YOU'RE A DETERMINED TRAITOR.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.458
DOCTORS.
FARMERS. ENGINEERS.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.722
AND EVERY LAST ONE
TRAINED TO KILL.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.638
EVEN THE KIDS.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.030
YES, BECAUSE
THEY HAD NO CHOICE.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.643
BUT WE COULD
GIVE THEM A CHOICE.

23:03.686 --> 23:06.210
THERE'S AN ARMY MARCHING
ACROSS THE DESERT

23:06.254 --> 23:08.604
TO ATTACK ME.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.171
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
INVITE THEM OVER FOR TEA?

23:10.214 --> 23:11.564
I DON'T KNOW.

23:11.607 --> 23:12.695
DO THE MURDERERS
AND THIEVES

23:12.739 --> 23:14.741
YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY NOW
DRINK TEA?

23:17.221 --> 23:18.353
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.963
WE NEED TO TALK.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.448
YOUR PILOT PULLED
A GUN ON ME.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.797
I'M TELLING YOU
OUT OF RESPECT.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.364
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR PERMISSION.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.411
YES, YOU ARE.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.587
MAN ON RADIO:
MCCREARY, IT'S DUFF.

23:34.630 --> 23:35.979
DID WE RELEASE THE PRISONERS?

23:37.241 --> 23:38.721
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:38.765 --> 23:40.941
MAN ON RADIO: ONE OF THEM JUST
TOOK OFF FROM THE AFT AIRLOCK.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.047
DON'T MAKE
ANY MORE NOISE.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.396
OH, THANK GOD.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.006
RAVEN KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULD BE WATCHING THE CAMP.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.921
WE GOTTA GO. NOW.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.712
-SHE'S STILL THERE.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.409
EMORI: YOU LEFT HER?
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.584
SHE MADE A DEAL
TO GET ME OUT. LISTEN.

24:15.628 --> 24:16.933
-TRUST ME.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.239
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.414
HARPER: WHAT ABOUT
ABBY AND KANE?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.242
WE SAW THEM BEING
LED OFF THE SHIP.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.504
YOU DID?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.332
ECHO: THAT MEANS BELLAMY
GOT THE BUNKER OPEN.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.073
DID HE NOT COME BACK?

24:26.116 --> 24:28.075
WHAT ABOUT CLARKE?

24:28.118 --> 24:29.380
WHO'S THE HOBBIT?

24:29.424 --> 24:30.599
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.774
WE JUST GOT TO GET
A WARNING TO BELLAMY

24:31.818 --> 24:33.384
BEFORE THEY FIRE
THEIR MISSILES.

24:33.428 --> 24:34.603
-YEAH, AS IN

24:34.647 --> 24:36.649
FIERY DEATH
FROM ABOVE.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.389
RAVEN SAID THAT WE NEED
TO GET INTO RADIO RANGE.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.914
-BEAR CAVE. I'LL DRIVE.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.960
DON'T WORRY.
THE BEARS ARE GONE.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.758
LOOK, BEFORE
YOU SAY ANYTHING,

24:58.801 --> 25:00.803
I LET MURPHY GO
SO SHE CAN UNLOCK
THE MISSILES.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.979
SYSTEM'S ARMED.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.156
MCCREARY: YOURS
HAVE JUST BEGUN.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.812
HER FRIEND'S STILL
COLLARED, BY THE WAY.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.121
RIGHT HERE.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.470
WE CAN BRING HIM IN NOW, OR

25:15.514 --> 25:16.645
WE CAN LET HIM LEAD US
TO THE REST OF

25:16.689 --> 25:18.125
THE HOSTILES IN THE WOODS.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.213
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.431
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

25:20.475 --> 25:21.955
DIYOZA: TAKE HER
BACK TO HER CELL.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.870
WELL DONE, SHAW.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.828
WE'LL GO HUNTING
WHEN WE COME BACK.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.003
WHEELS UP IN 20.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.240
BELLAMY, COME IN.
IT'S MURPHY.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.676
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.856
WHAT?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.554
THOUGHT YOU'D
BE FUNNIER.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.947
MONTY: CLARKE
TOLD HER STORIES.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.558
OH, REALLY?

25:59.601 --> 26:02.343
WAS I THE DASHING HERO
WHO GOT THE GIRL?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.258
OR THE SELFISH FOOL
WHO LOST HER?

26:06.695 --> 26:08.610
MADI: OCTAVIA'S
MY FAVORITE.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.177
I MEAN,
NO OFFENSE.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.613
CLARKE SAID SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT

26:11.657 --> 26:12.875
WITHOUT EACH
ONE OF YOU.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.269
ECHO: WE WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT WITHOUT HER.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.010
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.535
EMORI: JOHN!

26:22.711 --> 26:24.495
MONTY: THE COLLAR MUST HAVE
A PROXIMITY TETHER.

26:24.539 --> 26:25.845
MADI, BACK UP!

26:31.285 --> 26:32.634
MONTY: THAT'S IT.
STOP HERE.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.685
JOHN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

26:39.728 --> 26:40.816
HARPER: MONTY,
CAN YOU GET IT OFF?

26:40.860 --> 26:41.904
ECHO: THERE'S NO TIME.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.906
WE HAVE TO STOP THOSE MISSILES.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.780
ECHO'S RIGHT.
JUST LEAVE ME BEHIND.

26:47.823 --> 26:48.911
MONTY: NO WAY.
IF IT HAS A TETHER,

26:48.955 --> 26:50.217
IT'LL HAVE A TRACKER, TOO.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.610
THEY'RE PROBABLY ON
THEIR WAY RIGHT NOW.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.959
MURPHY: THAT MEANS
YOU GOTTA GO.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.796
GO. BEFORE
OUR FRIENDS EXPLODE.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.988
COME ON.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.310
OCTAVIA'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE

27:40.354 --> 27:41.747
WHO'S CHANGED,
YOU KNOW.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.447
YOU COULD'VE KILLED
THOSE PRISONERS IN CRYO,

27:46.490 --> 27:48.579
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

27:48.623 --> 27:51.670
DIYOZA WOULD'VE KILLED ME
IF NOT FOR YOU.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.062
MADI WOULD BE ALONE.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.936
YOU GOT THAT
BUNKER OPEN.

27:58.328 --> 28:01.070
WHO KNEW IT WOULD TURN OUT
TO BE PANDORA'S BOX?

28:05.292 --> 28:06.815
I'M SERIOUS, BELLAMY.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.819
THE HEART AND THE HEAD.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.648
THE HEART
AND THE HEAD.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.738
SO...WHAT DOES
YOUR HEAD SAY

28:16.782 --> 28:18.522
ABOUT TWO ARMIES
FIGHTING A WAR

28:18.566 --> 28:20.220
IN THE ONLY
GREEN PLACE ON EARTH?

28:21.525 --> 28:23.789
SAME AS YOURS.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.141
WHAT THE HELL?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.722
SANDSTORM.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.767
IT'S BLOCKING
THE WAY BACK.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.899
CAN WE OUTRUN IT?

28:46.942 --> 28:48.204
AS LONG AS IT KEEPS
MOVING LATERALLY

28:48.248 --> 28:49.815
FROM EAST TO WEST,
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO,

28:49.858 --> 28:51.686
BUT IF THE WIND SHIFTS--

28:51.730 --> 28:54.645
OCTAVIA: THE WIND
HASN'T MET WONKRU.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.996
NOW THERE'S NO CHOICE.
WE KEEP MOVING.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.085
BELLAMY: KEEP MOVING?
THANKS TO YOU,

28:59.128 --> 29:00.956
WE'RE STUCK BETWEEN
RAZOR-BLADE WINDS

29:01.000 --> 29:03.045
AND BURROWING,
PARASITIC BUGS.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.048
OCTAVIA: THANKS TO YOU,
WE'RE AT WAR, BELLAMY.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.833
ONLY IF YOU INSIST
ON FIGHTING IT.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.705
FIGHT OR DIE.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.534
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I GET IT.

29:13.577 --> 29:14.840
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT ONE OF US.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.104
IS OBIKA ONE OF YOU

29:19.322 --> 29:21.020
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO END HIS LIFE

29:21.063 --> 29:22.456
LIKE HE MEANS NOTHING.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.631
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

29:23.674 --> 29:24.806
COOPER, NO.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.461
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.897
-BELLAMY.
-EASY.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.769
I'D STOP
IF I WERE YOU.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.512
HE'S AWAKE.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.822
HOLD HIM DOWN!

29:58.187 --> 30:00.189
BELLAMY: EVERYBODY OUT!
NOW! GO!

30:03.845 --> 30:07.196
OCTAVIA: INDRA! BURN IT DOWN!
KILL THEM ALL!

30:25.388 --> 30:26.650
OCTAVIA: I CAN'T
FEEL MY LEGS.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.435
CLARKE: IT MUST BE
ITS VENOM.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.350
PUT HER ARM ON THE TABLE.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.005
WE CAN'T LET IT
GET INTO HER TORSO.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.963
I NEED YOU TO MAKE A TOURNIQUET
OUT OF WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.051
AND GET ME A MED KIT.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.052
THERE WERE DOZENS
OF THOSE WORMS.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.053
THEY MUST
LAY THEIR EGGS--

30:38.097 --> 30:39.141
THANK YOU! GO!

30:39.185 --> 30:41.056
I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.275
-WE GOT THIS.
-OK.

30:43.537 --> 30:44.886
BELLAMY: WILL
THAT STOP IT?

30:44.930 --> 30:47.454
CLARKE: IT'S NOT FOR THE WORM.
IT'S FOR THE BLOOD.

30:47.497 --> 30:48.934
I NEED A KNIFE NOW!

30:48.977 --> 30:50.152
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

30:50.196 --> 30:51.371
OK, YOU GOTTA
STOP MOVING.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.286
INDRA: WHATEVER YOU'RE
GOING TO DO, DO IT.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.723
OK. THIS IS
GONNA HURT.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.556
BELLAMY: CLARKE?

31:02.599 --> 31:03.949
CLARKE, YOU'RE
GONNA LOSE IT.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.385
CLARKE: LIKE HELL I AM.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.735
I GOT IT!
STAY STILL.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.650
OCTAVIA: CLARKE,
JUST PULL IT OUT.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.261
MONTY ON RADIO:
PLEASE, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.697
I GOT THIS.
TAKE IT.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.178
MONTY, IT'S ME.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.051
SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE GOT YOUR
EMERGENCY BEAT.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.269
MONTY: I DOUBT THAT.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.488
THE PRISONERS HAVE
AN EYE IN THE SKY

31:21.531 --> 31:23.011
ON THE MOTHERSHIP,
AND A MISSILE SYSTEM

31:23.055 --> 31:24.186
ON THEIR TRANSPORT SHIP.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.405
MISSILES?

31:25.448 --> 31:26.885
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

31:26.928 --> 31:27.755
YOU HAVE TO MOVE.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.539
HIDE SOMEWHERE.
TAKE COVER.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.063
BELLAMY: HIDE FROM
AN EYE IN THE SKY?

31:31.106 --> 31:32.499
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

31:32.542 --> 31:33.935
MONTY ON RADIO: MURPHY SAYS
WE HAVE A FRIEND INSIDE.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.937
IF HE'S RIGHT, THE EYE
WON'T BE WATCHING.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.852
YOU HAVE A WINDOW,
BUT YOU HAVE TO MOVE NOW.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.421
UHH! HERE.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.205
WHERE DO WE FIND
COVER FROM MISSILES

31:43.249 --> 31:45.077
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A WASTELAND?

31:45.120 --> 31:47.340
CLARKE: IF THEY
SEE US RETREAT,
THEY'LL STAND DOWN.

31:47.383 --> 31:49.211
OCTAVIA: YOU STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.518
WONKRU DOES NOT RETREAT.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.259
YOU DO IF
YOU WANT TO LIVE.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.478
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
FOR A DEBATE.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.350
EVEN IF WE DID RETREAT,
THE PATH HOME

31:57.393 --> 31:59.656
PUTS US IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SANDSTORM.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.616
THOSE RUINS
ARE NOT OUR HOME.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.533
THAT VALLEY IS,
AND WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.621
CLARKE: OCTAVIA, EASY.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.057
THE VENOM'S STILL
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.713
GET READY
TO UNDERSTAND.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.380
SHAW: WE HAVE TARGET LOCK.

32:30.818 --> 32:31.950
FIRE AT WILL.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.694
DIYOZA: WE'RE NOT
DOING THIS AGAIN, SHAW.

32:41.437 --> 32:42.786
COPY THAT.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.093
FIRE IN THE HOLE.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.012
ONE MORE FOR GOOD LUCK?

32:53.536 --> 32:54.885
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN LUCK.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.626
NO ONE COULD HAVE
SURVIVED THAT.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.064
TAKE US HOME.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.596
INDRA: HOLD!

33:11.902 --> 33:13.078
HOLD!

33:14.470 --> 33:16.472
HOLD!

33:17.908 --> 33:19.432
HOLD!

33:20.433 --> 33:22.565
HOLD!

33:23.784 --> 33:25.525
HOLD!

33:27.353 --> 33:29.094
HOLD!

33:30.443 --> 33:31.792
HOLD!

33:34.142 --> 33:35.926
HOLD!

33:37.450 --> 33:38.973
HOLD!

34:09.482 --> 34:10.613
ABBY...

34:17.011 --> 34:18.317
GIVE ME THE PILLS.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.668
NO.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.366
YOU PROMISED.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.332
CAN WE HELP YOU?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.769
DIYOZA SEEMS
TO THINK SO.

34:40.556 --> 34:41.905
TAKE HIM.

34:41.949 --> 34:42.993
WHAT?

34:43.037 --> 34:44.125
HOLD ON
A MINUTE. NO.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.909
ABBY: WAIT, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.128
ABBY, DON'T FIGHT THEM.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.521
WHERE ARE YOU--

34:52.177 --> 34:54.657
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM,
I WON'T HELP YOU.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.529
YES, YOU WILL.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.715
WHICH ONE OF THESE
IS YOURS?

35:25.732 --> 35:30.389
SO...CAN YOU SAVE ME?

35:33.740 --> 35:34.915
I'M NOT SURE.

35:37.657 --> 35:38.875
SHOULD I SAVE YOU?

35:59.766 --> 36:00.941
LET'S BEGIN.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.209
-KEEP MOVING.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.603
EYES FRONT.

36:10.646 --> 36:14.128
YOU'RE MAKING A MIS--
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.871
THERE ARE SO...
SO FEW PEOPLE LEFT.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.831
YOU CAN'T JUST...
KILL EVERYONE AND EXPECT--

36:45.246 --> 36:46.813
SO OCTAVIA'S DEAD?

36:48.684 --> 36:50.120
NO.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.818
WE SPOTTED
AN ENTIRE BATTALION

36:51.861 --> 36:54.037
HUDDLED IN A SANDSTORM
TO PROTECT HER.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.391
DO YOU THINK AN ARMY OF
MURDERERS AND THIEVES

36:59.434 --> 37:01.349
WOULD FOLLOW ME
INTO A SANDSTORM?

37:07.050 --> 37:08.487
I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.534
YOU LIKE TEQUILA?

37:13.622 --> 37:15.972
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER HAD IT.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.452
TODAY'S YOUR
LUCKY DAY.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.770
KANE: I WISH
YOU HADN'T GIVEN
ABBY BACK THOSE PILLS.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.511
DIYOZA: WISHES ARE
FOR THE WEAK.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.339
MY FATHER
USED TO SAY THAT.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.341
HE WAS HELPING HIDE ME
FROM THE SEAL TEAM

37:36.384 --> 37:38.212
THAT WAS SENT
TO BRING ME IN.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.561
MY TEAM.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.260
THEY PUT TWO
IN HIS HEAD,

37:42.303 --> 37:43.826
JUST LIKE
I TRAINED THEM.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.916
WHEN I HEARD THEM
UPSTAIRS, I KNEW
IT WAS OVER, SO...

37:48.483 --> 37:49.963
I SLASHED
MY OWN THROAT.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.011
SHOULD'VE PUT
TWO IN MY HEAD.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.798
THE PILL THING
IS BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR WIFE.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.321
AS LONG AS SHE
CAN DO HER JOB,

38:00.365 --> 38:02.280
WE DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.803
ABBY'S NOT MY WIFE.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.458
OH.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.431
KANPAI.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.045
AHH.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.754
BETTER THAN TEA,
DON'T YOU THINK?

38:44.974 --> 38:47.586
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE
GONNA BRING OUR PEOPLE OVER?

38:47.629 --> 38:50.719
MAYBE. BUT FIRST,

38:50.763 --> 38:52.112
TELL ME
ABOUT OCTAVIA.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.952
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
IS IT A WORM?

39:05.995 --> 39:07.432
I DON'T THINK SO.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.477
I'M GUESSING THERE'S
GLASS IN HER LUNGS.

39:09.521 --> 39:10.609
WE GOTTA GET HER
BACK TO POLIS.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.959
BLODREINA,
THERE'S 11 DEAD.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.177
12 INCLUDING OBIKA.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.181
TAKE THEIR WEAPONS
AND THEIR ARMOR.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.271
LEAVE THE BODIES.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.448
-THERE'S NO TIME.

39:23.491 --> 39:26.973
THE ENEMY CAN SEE US.
SOUND THE RETREAT.

39:30.585 --> 39:31.717
COOPER: PREPARE TO MOVE OUT!

39:31.760 --> 39:33.632
MAN: YOU HEARD HER.
LET'S MOVE, BOYS.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.285
MAN 2: READY?
I GOT IT.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.462
CLARKE:
HOW'S THAT ARM?

39:47.994 --> 39:51.389
DAMAGE TO THE MUSCLE
SHOULD BE MINIMAL, BUT

39:51.432 --> 39:54.217
WE'LL KNOW MORE
IN A FEW DAYS.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.655
THANK YOU FOR
SAVING MY LIFE.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.615
YOU SAVED OURS.

40:06.055 --> 40:10.669
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WONKRU IS STRONG.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.148
JUST LIKE THEIR LEADER.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.289
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE,
BIG BROTHER.

40:29.383 --> 40:34.388
BUT IF YOU EVER SPEAK OUT
AGAINST WONKRU AGAIN,

40:34.432 --> 40:36.608
THEN YOU ARE AN ENEMY
OF WONKRU.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.916
AND YOU ARE MY ENEMY.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.453
MAN: HEY, HEY, WHOA.
STOP. STOP.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.350
UH! HA HA!
