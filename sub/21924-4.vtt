 I have big plans
for that horse.

He could even go as far
as the Olympics someday.

Do you want to be
a part of that?

been completely honest with me.

People aren't buying expensive
horses like they used to,

keeping my business afloat.

quit Extreme Team.

OK.

That was a guy from the
Reagan Sanctuary, Alan Shore.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.200
They got a herd of
Mongolian horses.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.035
 You're kidding.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.119
 Yeah.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.537
It's weird, right?

02:42.662 --> 02:43.955
They want to ship a
stud back to Mongolia.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.331
 So why they'd call you?

02:45.457 --> 02:47.000
 I don't know.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.501
I guess, maybe they heard
about my experience in Mongolia

02:48.626 --> 02:50.670
and think I have
some connections?

02:50.795 --> 02:52.547
 Right.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.840
So go.

So I spoke to Scott

one more problem.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.528
And it's a big one.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.071
The whole point of
breeding these horses

06:03.196 --> 06:06.032
is to airlift a stud
back to Mongolia.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.118
But we keep them as free
and as wild as possible

06:08.243 --> 06:09.911
while they're here.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.956
And as a result, they're very
wary of any human interference.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.958
 Well, that'll help when
he gets back to Mongolia.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.335
 Yeah, but getting him there
is another thing entirely.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.795

was brought here.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.425
He hated it.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.718
But he hated that
crate even more.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.261
 Well, it's probably
'cause the crate's a lot

08:31.386 --> 08:32.511
smaller and more restricted.

08:32.636 --> 08:33.471
 No, maybe.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.181
But I don't know.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.225
I'm starting to think that
the only solution here

08:37.350 --> 08:39.602
is to sedate him with the
proper cocktail of drugs.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.022
 I would strongly
advise against that.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.733
It's a long trip to Ulaanbaatar,
and when the sedation

08:44.858 --> 08:46.151
wears off, he could
injure himself trying

08:46.276 --> 08:47.610
to get out of that crate.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.071
It's a huge risk.

 If we were able
to trailer him,

08:52.198 --> 08:53.700
we could bring him to
Heartland, and I could spend

some time working with him.

I can't promise
anything, but I could

try to get him used to coming
in and out of the crate.

the only way to do

20:03.328 --> 20:05.038
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.957
I just have a lot on my mind

20:08.083 --> 20:12.712
 A few weeks back, you
came clean to me about,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.923
you know, some of the
problems that you're

20:15.048 --> 20:16.591
dealing with financially.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.884
 Yeah.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.929
 Well, I told you then
that I was with you,

20:21.054 --> 20:22.681
that you could tell me stuff.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.933
But now you won't
even talk about it.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.267
And you're avoiding me.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.894
 I'm not avoiding you.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.314
I just-- I-- I don't want
to bother you with it.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.983
 You're not bothering me.

20:34.109 --> 20:38.029
Even if I can't help you,
I can at least listen.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.197
I need to do that.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.115
I need you.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.825
I'm missing you.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.118
 Oh, really?

20:43.243 --> 20:45.704
I mean, I thought you're
doing fine on your own.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.871
Great, in fact.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.249
Isn't that what you
just said to Tim?

20:49.374 --> 20:51.543
Sorry, I-- I have to--

20:51.668 --> 20:52.961
[sighs]

20:53.086 --> 20:55.296
[engine starting]

20:55.422 --> 20:58.967
[llama bleats]

21:02.429 --> 21:03.847
 Looking good.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.849
Nice work.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.350
 Yeah.
[clears throat]

21:07.475 --> 21:08.643
 Hey, did Jonah get
a hold of you yet?

21:08.768 --> 21:09.602
 Jonah?

21:09.728 --> 21:10.353
 Yeah.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.731
 No, why?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.607
 Oh, uh, because I was
talking to him yesterday.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.609
 You talked to Jonah?

21:16.735 --> 21:17.777
 Yeah, he needs some backup.

21:17.902 --> 21:18.778
 Wait.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.364
He needed help,
so he called you?

21:21.489 --> 21:24.159
Weird how you're the one getting
all the calls these days.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.368
 Come on, man.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.161
 You're the flavor
of the month.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.495
You know that, right?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.455
W-- what am I, the
guy who got to go

21:28.580 --> 21:29.998
to Mongolia with Dr. Ty Borden?

21:30.123 --> 21:31.166
 Very funny, OK?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.292
I told him to call you.

21:32.417 --> 21:33.626
 Oh, you told him to call me.

21:33.752 --> 21:34.586
He didn't think of it himself.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.795
 Bob, just call him.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.005
 Why should I?

21:37.130 --> 21:38.298
I'm not in to being
someone's second choice.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.174
Let him call me.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.761
[guitar music]

21:46.556 --> 21:50.018
[trailer whirring]

21:58.943 --> 21:59.861
 Hey, Alan.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.112
 Well, here's the crate.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.405
[baby crying]
- Awesome.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.573
Thank you.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

22:03.698 --> 22:04.908
ALAN: Have you talked
your transport--

22:05.033 --> 22:05.867
 You're OK, Lyndy.
ALAN: --guys over there?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.285
 I know.
TY: I have.

22:07.410 --> 22:07.952
Everything is coming together.
AMY: Shh, shh, shh.

22:08.078 --> 22:08.953
You're OK.

22:09.079 --> 22:09.537
Shh, shh, shh shh, shh.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.914
I know.
I know.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.374
 [sighs] Look, has
there been any progress?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.042
We need to set a date
for Attila's travel.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.126
TY: Absolutely.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.504
Let's talk to Amy.

22:17.629 --> 22:21.049
[baby fussing]

22:22.759 --> 22:27.097
 Attila seems really
focused on our mare and foal.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.224
 Seems so.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.643
 Alan, there was a mare
and foal out in your field.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.312
They seemed really agitated
when Attila was trailered.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.022
Is that his baby?

22:36.147 --> 22:38.692
 Yeah, it is.

22:38.817 --> 22:41.152
 See, he seemed to be
paying a lot of attention

22:41.277 --> 22:43.029
to them, especially the mare.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.364
 Well, he's a stud.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.657
He likes the ladies.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.535
 Yeah, but I'm not
sure it's just that.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.705
Is there any way that you
could bring them here?

22:51.830 --> 22:52.539
 What?

22:52.664 --> 22:53.665
Why?

22:53.790 --> 22:55.458
 He doesn't want to leave them.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.876
He's missing them.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.753
And that's why he's
resisting us so much.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.881
I know it's a long shot,
but please bring them here.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.049
I think I know what to do now.

23:05.969 --> 23:06.928
 Fine.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.848
I'll bring them,
or I'll attempt to.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.350
But I don't see how
this is gonna help.

23:12.475 --> 23:13.852
 Thanks, Al.

23:13.977 --> 23:17.522
[horse whinnying]

23:25.071 --> 23:26.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.365
 Hey, Brick.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.743
Come on in.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.119
Georgie, you coming?
- No, I can't.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.078
I'm sorry.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.038
I have practice.

23:33.163 --> 23:34.122
 Yeah, Georgie's training.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.623
She's got a big show coming up.

23:35.749 --> 23:36.541
Come on.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.792
 Well, you also have to eat.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.085
 Come on, honey.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.545
GEORGIE: I can look
after Brick if you want.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.504
Do you want to come
watch me jump, bud?

23:41.629 --> 23:42.630
 Mm-hmm.
GEORGIE: Yeah?

23:42.756 --> 23:44.257
Come on.
JEN: Thank you.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.216
 No problem.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.803
[guitar music]

23:53.767 --> 23:55.769
 Thank you for
bringing them here.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.395
 We had a heck of a time
trailering these guys,

23:57.520 --> 23:59.564
but here they are.

23:59.689 --> 24:02.484
I sure hope you know
what you're doing.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.943
 Well, they're in
a great spot there.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.820
I've moved all the
other Heartland

24:05.945 --> 24:08.948
horses away so that there won't
be any displays of jealousy.

24:09.074 --> 24:13.828
 Well, they're all yours,
for whatever it's worth.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.164
[calm instrumental music]

24:16.289 --> 24:19.167
[horse neighing]

24:19.292 --> 24:20.794
 Hey, Attila.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.921
It's OK.

24:23.046 --> 24:23.922
They're here now.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.013
[horses neighing]

24:32.889 --> 24:35.600
[laughs] You're not alone.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.607
[guitar music]

24:56.705 --> 24:57.706
WYATT: Hey.

25:00.000 --> 25:00.875
 Great.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.796
 You want to finish
your practicing and then,

25:04.921 --> 25:06.840
like, go into town or something?

25:06.965 --> 25:08.008
 I told you, I can't.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.010
I have a huge show this weekend.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.678
If I don't do well, I'm
gonna lose the opportunity

25:11.803 --> 25:13.179
to ride this horse.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.889
 Well, excuse me
for taking you away

25:15.015 --> 25:18.226
from such an important mission.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.812
I moved to Hudson, [laughs]
and now you don't even

25:20.937 --> 25:22.772
have the time of day for me.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.525
That's nice, really nice.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.818
But I get it.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.319
 No, I-- I don't think you do.

25:28.445 --> 25:29.738
Can we just talk?

25:29.863 --> 25:30.655
 Like last night?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.240
Like that kind of talk?

25:32.365 --> 25:35.702
'Cause no offense, but I
can really do without that.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.662
 All I want to do is
help you, like when

25:37.787 --> 25:39.414
you helped me with Adam.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.790
 How?

25:40.915 --> 25:42.417
 Because of what you said!

25:42.542 --> 25:43.752
You told me to reach out to him.

25:43.877 --> 25:44.586
I did.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.920
And now we're friends.

25:46.046 --> 25:46.713
 Great.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.214
That's awesome.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.884
I'm-- I'm so glad that I
could help you like that.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.635
 I'm sorry.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.721
 I don't need
your sympathy, OK?

25:54.846 --> 25:55.930
I don't want your sympathy.

25:56.056 --> 25:56.848
[brick grunting]

25:56.973 --> 25:58.725
Can you stop grabbing me?

25:58.850 --> 26:01.561
Go-- go find your
mom or something.

26:05.023 --> 26:08.276
[sighs]

26:10.236 --> 26:11.613
 Brick, I'll see
you in the house, OK?

26:14.449 --> 26:17.619
[horse whinnying]

26:17.744 --> 26:19.537
 How are the kids doing?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.665
 Uh, everyone is fine.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.584
Wyatt is in total
denial, and Brick

26:24.709 --> 26:25.794
is regressing, so fun times.

26:25.919 --> 26:26.461
[laughs]

26:26.586 --> 26:27.962
 Hmm.

26:28.088 --> 26:28.922
Well, you're handling
things really well.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.090
 Thank you.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.299
 I admire you, Jen.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.802
It's obvious that
you're bearing up.

26:33.927 --> 26:37.013
 I try to keep a smile
on my face for the kids.

26:37.138 --> 26:41.393
But you got to laugh, or you'd
probably just cry all the time.

26:41.518 --> 26:42.852
Seriously, though.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.605
It's-- it's insane how
the unexpected can just

26:45.730 --> 26:47.440
be around the corner, you know?

26:47.565 --> 26:50.276
I mean, you go along
thinking everything is fine.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.152
And then, bam!

26:51.277 --> 26:54.280
It's just not.

26:54.406 --> 26:57.075
Anything can happen.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.412
Even to a beautiful
39-year-old man

27:00.537 --> 27:03.164
who was in perfect health
this time last year.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.087
[sighs] So take that warning.

27:09.212 --> 27:12.007
[laughs] Don't take
anything for granted.

27:12.132 --> 27:12.966
Lesson learned.

27:16.761 --> 27:19.097
And on that note, that concludes
this topic of conversation.

27:19.222 --> 27:25.645
[laughs]

27:25.770 --> 27:28.273
 Here you go, Attila.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.275
Nothing to be afraid of.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.151
You can see them.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.110
They're right there.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.363
[horses neighing]

27:36.823 --> 27:40.201
[horse neighing]

27:42.162 --> 27:42.996
You can do it.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.294
Good job.

27:49.419 --> 27:52.672
[laughs] Good job.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.220
[horse whinnying]

27:59.346 --> 28:00.638
[banging]

28:00.764 --> 28:03.683
Whoa, easy.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.518
Easy.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.187
I'm not gonna force him.

28:07.312 --> 28:10.398
[horse neighing]

28:12.484 --> 28:14.110
Attila's smart.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.279
He knows that the crate
means leaving his family.

28:16.404 --> 28:19.783
And that means saying
goodbye to them.

28:19.908 --> 28:22.369
Is there any way that
they could go with him?

28:22.494 --> 28:24.037
 No.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.206
It's too dangerous for the
foal to travel that far.

28:26.331 --> 28:28.249
It's best just to
make the break.

28:28.375 --> 28:31.920
[phone ringing]

28:36.341 --> 28:37.550
[beep]

28:37.676 --> 28:40.261
Hey, Jonah.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.554
L-- listen, man.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.307
I-- you know I'd love to
help you out, but I can't.

28:44.432 --> 28:45.266
Have you called Bob?

28:48.186 --> 28:50.271
Well, uh, maybe he
didn't get the message.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.065
You should try again.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.608
I don't need time to
think it over, man.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.277
I-- I've made up my mind.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.447
 Weird looking horses.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.408
AMY: They're Mongolian.

29:01.533 --> 29:05.412
The sire, that one there, is
being shipped back to breed.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.497
He's going through some pretty
severe separation anxiety

29:07.622 --> 29:08.540
right now.

29:08.665 --> 29:11.292
 [sighs] Yeah, I get that.

29:14.838 --> 29:16.965
 You know, Wyatt,
for what it's worth,

29:17.090 --> 29:18.633
I lost my mom when I
was a little bit younger

29:18.758 --> 29:21.803
than you are now.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.180
Grief is a weird thing.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.892
You know, it-- it goes away.

29:28.018 --> 29:33.314
But then it comes back sometimes
when you least expect it.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.193
I miss my mom even more now that
I have a daughter of my own,

29:37.318 --> 29:40.238
and I realize what that
love is between a parent

29:40.363 --> 29:41.614
and their child.

29:41.740 --> 29:42.949
It's a scary thing.

29:43.074 --> 29:44.993
You'd do anything for your kid.

29:45.118 --> 29:47.871
 Hmm.

29:47.996 --> 29:52.292
My dad did everything
for me, no matter what.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.836
 Your mom will too.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.421
 Jen's not my mom.

29:56.546 --> 30:00.717
She-- my mom just
disappeared when I was six.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.761
She just walked out.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.221
Jen's my step-mom.

30:05.347 --> 30:07.098
JEN: Brick?

30:07.223 --> 30:09.309
Brick!

30:09.434 --> 30:11.019
Hey.

GEORGIE: Brick!

30:19.611 --> 30:21.946
TIM: Brick!

30:22.072 --> 30:23.573
 I pushed the little
guy away when he was just

30:23.698 --> 30:28.870
trying to get my attention, like
literally reaching out for me.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.914
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.582
 You're going through
a lot of crap right now.

30:32.707 --> 30:36.419
And you need to come to terms
with that, but not right now.

Brick!

30:39.923 --> 30:41.216
JEN: Whoa!

30:41.341 --> 30:42.926
I've been worried about
him for months now.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.511
It's like he's
completely withdrawn.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.764
He hasn't spoken a
word since Curtis died.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.057
[sighs] A terrible mother.

30:49.182 --> 30:50.558
Why didn't I just
keep an eye on him?

30:50.684 --> 30:51.726
 We're gonna find him.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.520
 We will, Jen.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.487
 OK, I just saw
your face there.

31:02.612 --> 31:04.322
What what is going on?

31:04.447 --> 31:05.699
I mean it.

31:05.824 --> 31:08.660
 OK, do you really want
to know what's happening?

31:08.785 --> 31:10.370
 Yes, I want to know.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.706
 OK, so my house in France,
I had rented it to a couple.

31:12.831 --> 31:14.833
They walked without payment.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.961
So now I am trying to
wildly find another tenant.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.087
Meanwhile, on top
of all that, I've

31:19.212 --> 31:21.214
been trying to sell
my best breeder,

31:21.339 --> 31:22.757
and that is not going well.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.426
Fell through.

31:24.551 --> 31:27.053
So all in all, this has
been a pretty horrible week.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.555
I don't want to talk about it.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.848
 There you go again.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.349
 Well, yes, there I go again.

31:31.474 --> 31:32.851
Because nobody wants to
hear these dumb problems.

31:32.976 --> 31:33.977
I don't even want to hear them.

It's Jack.

31:59.919 --> 32:05.133

right now, and so is Wyatt.

32:05.258 --> 32:07.052

family the most, when

32:12.349 --> 32:14.726
things aren't going too well.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.811
I think we should let
your mom and your brother

32:16.936 --> 32:19.522
know that you're OK, don't you?

32:19.647 --> 32:23.693
Think that's a good idea,
so they can stop worrying?

32:23.818 --> 32:27.614

now, what do you say?

me Lyndy's blanket?

 I'll give Alan a call
and tell him the good news.

 Yeah, I guess it's good news.

his mare and foal is brutal.

leave for the clinic or Bob's.

is that Val texted me.

out of town for the show.

43:02.290 --> 43:07.796
When I laid down by the side of
the road where I made my grave.

43:07.921 --> 43:09.130
[crying]

43:09.255 --> 43:12.300
Oh, I gotta keep going,
gotta keep going on.

43:12.425 --> 43:13.134
 My dad is, um--

43:13.259 --> 43:15.053
[crying]

43:15.178 --> 43:16.554

 GOIN' GETS GONE"]

43:16.680 --> 43:20.308
 From the dead of night to
the break of the early dawn.

43:20.433 --> 43:21.851
 He's really gone.

43:21.976 --> 43:23.228
[MUSIC - LINDI ORTEGA, "TIL THE
 GOIN' GETS GONE"]

43:23.353 --> 43:28.066
 Yeah, I gotta keep
going, gotta keep going on.

43:28.191 --> 43:30.985
Keep on going, little darling.

43:31.111 --> 43:33.321
Till the going gets gone.

43:36.950 --> 43:43.540
Oh I gotta keep going,
gotta keep going on.

43:43.665 --> 43:50.171
Keep on going, little darling,
till the going gets gone.

43:50.296 --> 43:55.927
Keep on going, little darling,
till the going gets gone, gone,

43:56.052 --> 43:57.470
gone.

43:57.595 --> 44:03.018
Keep on going, little darling,
till the going gets gone.
