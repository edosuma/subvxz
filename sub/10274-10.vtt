00:02.190 --> 00:04.294
-Um, the surveillance
reports you requested.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.030
Alexandria, Virginia,
the week of January 23rd.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.884
The DOD meeting was on the same
day as that horrible murder.

00:09.890 --> 00:12.211
-You mean that couple
and their daughter?

00:12.220 --> 00:13.812
-That scared the hell out of me.

00:13.820 --> 00:15.412
Get me all the files
and physical evidence

00:15.420 --> 00:16.773
connected to those murders.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.042
don't you
let me handle this?

00:18.050 --> 00:20.712
Mullin's a camera buff,
classical music lover.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.846
There's a million
ways In on this.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.499
-I'm so sorry.

00:23.510 --> 00:25.956
I'm just having a hard time.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.063
-What are you doing here?

00:27.070 --> 00:29.504
-It's OK cause uh,
I'm with Septic.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.434
- Hey, hey, he's got a
cam--

00:36.400 --> 00:38.823
-Are we going to start going
to church every Sunday now?

00:38.830 --> 00:41.048
-$600?

00:41.060 --> 00:42.368
That was all you had.

00:42.370 --> 00:43.155
-Lie to us.

00:43.160 --> 00:43.478
-Dad!

00:43.480 --> 00:43.923
-Stop it!

00:43.930 --> 00:44.624
-Why?

00:44.630 --> 00:45.927
Does this book tell
you to do that?

00:45.930 --> 00:46.680
-Phillip.

00:46.690 --> 00:49.909
-You respect Jesus but not us?

00:49.910 --> 00:51.207
-You didn't have
a choice, Philip.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.108
This is war.

00:52.110 --> 00:52.804
Regan--

00:52.810 --> 00:55.040
-I don't need the speech.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.153
I know it's war.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.434
This is easier for.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.089
-You think it's easy for me?

00:59.100 --> 01:00.089
What I do?

01:19.350 --> 01:20.829
-Hi.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.298
-Hey.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.619
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.138
-No, I-- wasn't really sleeping.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.062
You hungry?

01:56.420 --> 01:59.127
-I want to talk to Paige.

01:59.130 --> 02:01.826
Tell her I'm sorry.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.524
-No.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.438
You weren't wrong.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.907
She was disrespecting us.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.921
I made her clean the
kitchen, mop the floor.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.149
Come here.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.149
Take this off.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.109
You look tired.

03:44.510 --> 03:45.966
-You back already?

03:45.970 --> 03:48.427
-Yeah, I had a
personal emergency.

03:48.430 --> 03:49.863
-Sorry to hear it, man.

03:49.870 --> 03:52.100
Anything I can do?

03:52.110 --> 03:54.999
-Eh, some things in live you
can only handle yourself.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.820
-I hear that.

03:56.830 --> 03:57.831
Good luck.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.534
-Thanks.

04:35.530 --> 04:36.224
-Mm-hmm.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.651
Yes.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.354
Thank you.

05:18.490 --> 05:19.388
Good morning.

05:19.390 --> 05:21.449
I'm calling from the JD
Pierce elementary school

05:21.450 --> 05:25.739
in Mezzo Heights regarding
our 17th Annual fund drive.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.002
-We'd be happy to
make a contribution.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.108
-Leggo my eggo.

05:37.110 --> 05:37.860
-It's not an eggo.

05:37.870 --> 05:38.598
mom made it.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.669
-Oh.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.364
In that case.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.565
-Put us down for $25, please.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.516
-So Henry, I signed you up for
a math club after school today.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.635
-What?

05:46.640 --> 05:48.744
-April fools!

05:48.750 --> 05:50.297
-April Fool's is in a week, Dad.

05:52.730 --> 05:53.424
-Yeah, I know.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.773
Just practicing.

05:55.780 --> 05:56.530
-Come on, Henry.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.897
-She'll be fine.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.606
-Yeah.

06:05.610 --> 06:06.793
-We have to get to the office.

06:13.380 --> 06:16.986
-Sounds like things got
rough in training camp.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.173
Are you OK?

06:18.180 --> 06:19.647
-We're fine.

06:19.650 --> 06:22.369
It was a dangerous mission,
and a successful one.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.621
The Senator is very pleased.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.495
-So where do our photos wind up?

06:26.500 --> 06:29.139
-We're leaking them to a
newspaper in South America.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.436
They'll make their
way to Capitol Hill.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.010
The important thing
is you're safe.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.460
Something's come up.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.290
It's time sensitive.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.837
We'd like you to tackle it
if you feel you're ready.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.840
A Pakistani_ _
delegation IS arrIVIng

06:48.850 --> 06:51.023
in Washington today for talks.

06:51.030 --> 06:54.864
20 diplomats, but 5 of them are
151, Covert Action Division.

06:54.870 --> 06:55.939
-To meet with the CIA?

06:55.940 --> 06:56.634
-Yes.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.858
The Americans are stepping
up their arms shipments

06:58.870 --> 07:00.974
through Pakistan
to the Mujahideen.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.232
We're getting hit hard this year
throughout the African tribal

07:03.240 --> 07:05.356
regions, especially
in the southeast.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.386
We need someone on the inside.

07:08.390 --> 07:09.618
-Who have you got?

07:09.630 --> 07:10.949
-Yousaf Rana.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.667
Number two guy, Covert Action.

07:13.670 --> 07:16.264
Highly respected, next in
line to run the division.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.532
We assessed him
four years ago when

07:17.540 --> 07:19.474
he was in the
Netherlands on a posting.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.825
Oxford educated, former
professional cricket player.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.832
-Potentially susceptible.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.991
-Dated European women,
one of the Guinness girls.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.865
-How long they here?

07:29.870 --> 07:31.189
-Four days.

07:31.190 --> 07:33.886
-That's not much time.

07:33.890 --> 07:34.584
-We'll be fine.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.340
-My government has agreed to
accept your police department's

08:02.350 --> 08:06.662
version of events surrounding
Vlad Kosygin's death.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.979
-I got a call
early this morning.

08:08.990 --> 08:10.218
Is that why you're here?

08:10.220 --> 08:12.973
To congratulate me
on my reinstatement?

08:12.980 --> 08:15.665
Or are you trying to tell
me you know where I live?

08:15.670 --> 08:18.798
-You could've destroyed us both.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.246
-Mutually assured destruction.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.456
Keeps the world spinning.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.689
-He was a 23-year-old
first year officer.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.373
He'd been here three months.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.029
Would have washed out in a year.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.498
Didn't have the
stomach for the trade.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.070
He wanted to be a doctor.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.092
-He should have been a doctor.

08:45.710 --> 08:49.168
I had a friend, Chris Amador.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.092
Funny guy.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.489
What we like to
call a character.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.754
He could light up a room.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.671
You target our people,
we target yours.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.240
-You have a beautiful
home, Agent Gaad.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.674
-I'd give you a tour,
but I'm due back at work.

09:37.130 --> 09:41.942
-Excuse me, is this your paper?

09:41.950 --> 09:43.929
-Just leave me the crossword.

09:43.940 --> 09:46.920
-Sunday was a bear, wasn't it?

09:46.930 --> 09:48.409
Let's see.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.409
Thank you.

10:01.870 --> 10:02.859
-They're here.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.330
-Pleasure to meet you.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.329
-How do you do, sir?

10:10.330 --> 10:11.820
-Pleasure.

10:11.830 --> 10:12.819
-Very nice to meet you.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.809
-Let's go chat.

10:30.510 --> 10:31.590
-How'd it go with Yousaf?

10:31.600 --> 10:34.285
-It shouldn't be a problem.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.575
-I think we should use Annelise.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.842
-You do?

10:40.850 --> 10:41.544
-Yeah.

10:41.550 --> 10:45.281
This guy's been 151
for eight years.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.154
He's experienced.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.788
He'll be suspicious of a woman
he meets in a bar or hotel

10:48.790 --> 10:51.042
lobby, but the
wife of the Deputy

10:51.050 --> 10:52.051
Undersecretary of Defence?

10:54.680 --> 10:58.286
-But Annelise has no experience
running something like this.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.133
Yeah, maybe to make
the initial contact.

11:00.140 --> 11:03.803
But she'd have to keep it
going for months, maybe years.

11:03.810 --> 11:06.779
-I'll get her there.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.973
-I can do my job, Phillip.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.336
-I know you can, but this
time you don't have to.

11:14.670 --> 11:19.266
-When was the last time
you spoke to Annelise?

11:19.270 --> 11:20.521
-Six weeks ago.

11:20.530 --> 11:22.134
Trust me, this is
the better move.

11:42.690 --> 11:45.079
-Welcome back, sir.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.968
Congratulations.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.471
-What's all this?

11:49.480 --> 11:51.789
-Oleg Burov.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.415
Arrives in this
country January 8th

11:53.420 --> 11:56.389
to head up Line X
for the Rezidentura.

11:56.390 --> 11:58.119
Two weeks later, there's a
meeting of all the groups

11:58.120 --> 12:00.202
working with the DOD
on stealth technology.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.326
That's here.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.891
That same weekend there's a
family murdered in a hotel room

12:05.900 --> 12:07.674
here.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.374
-Close.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.074
-Mm-hmm.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.604
Too close.

12:10.610 --> 12:12.430
-Do you think Burov is involved?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.089
_-I can't make a
direct connection.

12:14.090 --> 12:16.934
Look, look.

12:16.940 --> 12:22.162
No suspects, no motive, shot
to death in a hotel room

12:22.170 --> 12:24.650
two miles away from
a top secret meeting.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.732
-The dead couple,
any DOD connection?

12:27.740 --> 12:28.809
-I haven't found any.

12:33.530 --> 12:36.272
-Why where were they
there at the hotel?

12:36.280 --> 12:40.273
-Their son told the police
they were on a family vacation.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.339
-You ever take a briefcase
With you on vacation?

12:45.120 --> 12:45.814
-No.

13:19.940 --> 13:20.747
Holy shit.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.809
-Yeah.

13:22.810 --> 13:25.836
Drug dealers and
smugglers, they rig up

13:25.840 --> 13:30.004
concealments, but not like this.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.079
This is an intelligence service.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.383
-It's the corner table.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.848
You look spectacular.

13:47.850 --> 13:48.544
-Thank you.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.689
So do you.

13:50.690 --> 13:52.988
-We could skip this.

13:52.990 --> 13:56.608
Go upstairs, have room service.

13:56.610 --> 13:58.475
-I can't do that.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.291
Douglas and I have been
trying to make things work.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.858
-Oh.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.417
-He's a wonderful man.

14:05.420 --> 14:08.218
He's so understanding.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.539
-Well then good for you.

14:09.540 --> 14:13.032
I-- I have nothing but respect
for the great institution

14:13.040 --> 14:15.417
of marriage or
those who can do it.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.551
Anyway, that's not why I called.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.677
-It's not?

14:25.680 --> 14:29.389
-Swedish intelligence needs you.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.062
-Are you serious?

14:32.070 --> 14:34.493
-There's a dinner tonight in
the home of William Clark,

14:34.500 --> 14:37.139
the new head of the
National Security Council.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.698
-You are serious.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.928
-A Pakistani delegation
will be there,

14:40.930 --> 14:46.459
and I would like you
to talk to this man.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.939
-Who is he?

14:47.940 --> 14:52.047
-He's not a bad man,
but dangerous things

14:52.050 --> 14:54.211
are happening in Pakistan.

14:54.220 --> 14:58.702
Things that could
threaten all of Europe.

14:58.710 --> 15:01.941
Annelise, it's important.

15:01.950 --> 15:03.338
-I don't think
we're even inVIted

15:03.340 --> 15:06.798
to a party at William
Clark's house.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.939
-How hard would it
be for the Deputy

15:08.950 --> 15:12.215
Undersecretary of
Defence to get invited?

15:12.220 --> 15:12.914
-Hm.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.748
He's handsome.

15:18.750 --> 15:19.444
-And powerful.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.716
-What do you need me to do?

15:50.510 --> 15:51.204
-Hey, Dad.

15:51.210 --> 15:51.904
Do you have a minute?

15:54.070 --> 15:54.764
-Sure.

15:57.650 --> 15:58.810
-I've come to a decision.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.296
Here's what I want
to do this summer.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.856
-Cedar Grove Fellowship Camp?

16:15.850 --> 16:18.933
Is this from church?

16:18.940 --> 16:21.477
-Look, I know it's
not your thing,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.528
but it's not all
preachy and everything.

16:23.530 --> 16:25.600
It's just-- it's normal.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.828
Swimming and hiking
and they teach

16:27.830 --> 16:29.889
you teamwork and social values.

16:29.890 --> 16:31.391
-Three months?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.311
-That's the summer.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.161
It's a summer camp.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.702
I'm not even asking for money.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.110
I'll be a CIT.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.430
Counsellor in Training.

16:46.390 --> 16:48.017
OK.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.511
I'll uh-- I'll talk to your mom.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.159
-All right, but I really
need to get this in.

16:53.170 --> 16:56.048
It's almost April and
it starts June 5th.

16:56.050 --> 16:58.871
And that's like soon.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.916
-And you're old enough
to be a counsellor?

17:00.920 --> 17:01.807
-Yeah.

17:01.810 --> 17:03.368
Well, in training.

17:03.380 --> 17:04.074
-Wow.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.614
OK, counsellor.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.317
-Is she kidding?

20:48.320 --> 20:49.764
She can get a job
for the summer.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.989
She can do a paper route or take
tickets at the movie theatre.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.014
-We||--

20:54.020 --> 20:55.135
-You don't agree?

20:55.140 --> 20:57.563
-I worry if we say
no, she just digs in.

20:57.570 --> 20:59.891
-But if we say yes, she
comes home a Jesus freak.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.767
-Well then maybe we just need
to let her figure it out.

21:02.770 --> 21:05.591
-I'm not trusting someone
else with our daughter's mind.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.864
-What if we say no and
she does something else?

21:07.870 --> 21:11.317
Like drinking or drugs?

21:11.320 --> 21:14.380
-I'll take my chances.

21:14.390 --> 21:15.209
-Well then maybe--

21:15.220 --> 21:16.300
-Where are we with Annelise?

21:21.310 --> 21:23.005
-What'd you order?

21:23.010 --> 21:25.365
All this sneaking around
gives me an appetite.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.379
-So how'd it go?

21:31.390 --> 21:34.302
-Good, I think.

21:34.310 --> 21:35.641
No, it was good.

21:35.650 --> 21:39.256
I felt like I was doing
something important.

21:39.260 --> 21:40.500
-Tell me.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.091
-Well Yousaf kept
checking me out

21:42.100 --> 21:43.579
during Bill Clark's
warmonger toast.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.091
Then I got Jeanne
Kirkpatrick to introduce us.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.977
We ended up on the
patio smoking those--

21:50.980 --> 21:52.322
those little
Japanese Cigarettes.

21:52.330 --> 21:53.888
You know, the ones that
come in the blue pack?

21:53.900 --> 21:56.676
-What did you find out?

21:56.680 --> 22:00.389
-Well he's here _on_some
big, secret mi55ion.

22:00.390 --> 22:03.348
But he doesn't really
know that much about it.

22:03.350 --> 22:05.295
-What do you mean?

22:05.300 --> 22:07.018
-He's the number two.

22:07.020 --> 22:09.784
And his boss, this Javid Parvez?

22:09.790 --> 22:12.441
Well, Javid doesn't really
keep him in the loop.

22:12.450 --> 22:15.522
Yousaf knows diddly squat.

22:15.530 --> 22:18.044
He's set to get Javid's
job in a couple years, so.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.213
We can't wait a couple years.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.859
-Do you want me
to go after Javid?

22:23.860 --> 22:25.339
-No.

22:25.340 --> 22:26.705
No, you-- you've been great.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.109
Really great.

22:28.110 --> 22:30.066
How did you leave
things with Yousaf?

22:30.070 --> 22:32.231
-He said he wants to see
me again before he leaves.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.662
-I want to shut down a mission.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.069
-Shut it down?

22:40.080 --> 22:40.774
-Yeah.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.372
Yousaf's boss keeps
him in the dark.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.404
Doesn't let him in on anything.

22:43.410 --> 22:45.219
We're just waisting our time.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.222
-Reagan's trying to turn
Afghanistan into our Vietnam.

22:48.230 --> 22:50.164
We've all got brothers
fighting there.

22:50.170 --> 22:51.023
Fathers, sons.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.965
-I understand that,
but we have a problem.

22:53.970 --> 22:56.575
-All right.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.093
Let me talk to the Centre.

22:58.100 --> 23:01.729
Meanwhile, have Elizabeth
keep working the target.

23:01.740 --> 23:04.436
-Annelise is working it.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.510
-That doesn't seem
like the best way.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.217
-Well, the intel on
Javid came from her.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.563
Can we move on?

23:12.570 --> 23:14.344
-I am not a dolt, Philip.

23:14.350 --> 23:15.169
-I didn't think you were.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.250
-I am responsible
for you, and I expect

23:17.260 --> 23:18.887
a certain amount of respect.

23:18.890 --> 23:22.007
If you mess up, my head
will roll, not yours.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.570
-No, if we mess up, we're dead.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.842
So I'll wait for
word from the Centre.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.440
-You armed?

23:40.450 --> 23:43.226
-Yeah.

23:43.230 --> 23:45.528
It's still cold out there.

23:45.530 --> 23:48.806
-Judge Akin, case 41967P.

23:48.810 --> 23:50.220
-You like the cherry blossoms?

23:50.230 --> 23:51.527
-Never miss 'em.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.224
And the number?

23:52.230 --> 23:54.551
-Yeah.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.097
As long as I've been
here, they still

23:57.100 --> 23:59.546
knock me out year after year.

23:59.550 --> 24:00.244
-OK.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.349
It looks like this
number is unaSSIgned.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.328
Best I can do is give
you a junction box.

24:18.330 --> 24:20.241
-That'd be great, Mrs. Portman.

24:20.250 --> 24:24.516
-Corner of Grand street and
Mohawk Lane in Bethesda.

24:24.520 --> 24:29.162
Pier number 1457.

24:29.170 --> 24:30.501
-Thanks for this.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.386
You did some good today.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.603
-We're finding everything
out that we can.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.623
Where they worked,
hobbies, phone records.

24:40.630 --> 24:42.348
What they did in
their spare time.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.045
Matching the names
of birth certificates

24:44.050 --> 24:45.392
of people who died young.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.049
Tracing border crossing records.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.927
-Speak to the Metro Police?

24:48.930 --> 24:50.477
-Yeah, they've got nothing.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.061
They didn't know what
they were looking for.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.019
-He was down at the
pool when it happened.

24:55.030 --> 24:57.772
Didn't see anything til
he came up and found them.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.111
If he'd been there
10 minutes earlier--

24:59.120 --> 25:00.792
-Kid was lucky.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.006
-Not that luclq.

25:02.010 --> 25:05.366
-Arkady covered this up well.

25:05.370 --> 25:08.225
-Yeah, but he couldn't
have been perfect.

25:08.230 --> 25:09.720
And the killer is
still out there.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.819
-I just got a signal.

25:17.830 --> 25:22.961
They want us to kill Yousaf's
boss, Javid Parvez, He goes,

25:22.970 --> 25:26.019
Yousaf steps into the job.

25:26.030 --> 25:29.113
They don't want to
let this one go.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.463
-This whole thing's going to be
won or lost in the third world.

25:34.270 --> 25:36.545
Did they give us anything?

25:36.550 --> 25:38.393
-Javid's travelling with
virtually no security,

25:38.400 --> 25:40.721
and he takes a swim every
night before dinner.

25:44.570 --> 25:46.891
-I'll take care of him.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.697
-You'll be with Annelise.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.669
I'll go to the pool.

25:51.670 --> 25:52.625
It's the best move.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.215
Is she ready?

26:00.470 --> 26:01.858
Because we're going
to a lot of trouble

26:01.860 --> 26:04.192
if you can't get her there.

26:04.200 --> 26:04.939
-She'll get there.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.243
-We're all set.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.890
Dinner in his room,
tomorrow night.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.007
-What?

26:39.010 --> 26:41.422
What's wrong?

26:41.430 --> 26:42.966
-I'm a little worried.

26:42.970 --> 26:45.359
-About?

26:45.360 --> 26:46.054
What?

26:46.060 --> 26:47.630
Is it me?

26:47.640 --> 26:52.213
-I'm not sure
you're really ready.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.141
-To do what?

26:55.850 --> 26:59.695
-Yousaf has to talk to you.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.806
-Men talk to me.

27:05.270 --> 27:08.808
But his job is not to talk.

27:19.490 --> 27:20.934
-Are you OK?

27:20.940 --> 27:21.861
-I've only got five minutes.

27:21.870 --> 27:24.612
Listen, a few
months ago a family

27:24.620 --> 27:26.429
was murdered in_ a
hotel in Alexandria.

27:26.430 --> 27:27.806
Do you remember that?

27:27.810 --> 27:30.028
-It was on the news.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.962
-I think they were illegals.

27:31.970 --> 27:33.176
-What?

27:33.180 --> 27:34.272
Are you sure?

27:34.280 --> 27:36.271
-It looks that way.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.601
It must of been chaos
at the Rezidentura.

27:38.610 --> 27:40.407
-They would keep it quiet.

27:40.410 --> 27:43.527
-Well you must have heard
something, seen something.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.259
-I have nothing to
do with illegals.

27:45.260 --> 27:46.215
You know that, Stan.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.074
-Listen, I think
that Burov is here

27:48.080 --> 27:50.059
to steal stealth
technology, and that those

27:50.060 --> 27:51.960
illegals we're
trying to help him.

27:51.970 --> 27:55.588
I don't know how, but I finally
have the clearance to find out.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.309
And when I do, Oleg Burov's
ass will be kicked out

27:58.310 --> 28:01.814
of this country so fast he won't
have time to buckle his pants.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.641
-Good.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.606
-I'm sorry, I really have to go.

28:11.530 --> 28:14.272
-What?

28:14.280 --> 28:14.974
What's the matter?

28:14.980 --> 28:18.416
Tell me.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.899
-Sandra is having an affair.

28:25.820 --> 28:28.766
-So are you.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.270
It's been bad for so long.

28:35.280 --> 28:41.287
Not bad, not
anything, just dead.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.941
But the funny thing, the crazy
thing is, it's still a shock.

28:47.870 --> 28:50.270
-She was a big
part of your life.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.272
You have a son.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.781
-I shouldn't be
telling you this.

28:54.790 --> 28:57.702
1--

28:57.710 --> 29:00.622
-Makes me sad.

29:00.630 --> 29:03.064
-Sad?

29:03.070 --> 29:04.367
-To see you in pain.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.759
I really have to get back.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.259
-It's not bad.

30:50.270 --> 30:55.139
The second n is a
little off, but--

30:55.150 --> 30:56.151
-You went through my garbage?

30:59.070 --> 31:00.503
-I was emptying you garbage.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.863
And from now on,
you can empty it.

31:01.870 --> 31:04.418
In fact, you can take out the
trash for the whole house.

31:07.790 --> 31:09.974
-I didn't turn it in.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.299
The application.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.949
-I know you didn't.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.200
I spoke to Pastor Tim.

31:14.210 --> 31:15.029
-You what?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.849
-I also told him you will
not be going to camp.

31:16.860 --> 31:17.906
-This is bullshit.

31:17.910 --> 31:18.934
-Paige.

31:18.940 --> 31:19.895
-I'm so sick of this.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.219
Henry breaks into
the neighbour's house

31:21.230 --> 31:22.492
and it's no big deal.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.219
But I want to be a better
person and I'm the bad guy?

31:25.220 --> 31:27.927
-You don't know what's
best for you, and I do.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.409
-You can't stop me.

31:29.410 --> 31:30.104
-Watch me.

31:42.590 --> 31:43.579
Let's get going.

31:43.580 --> 31:44.569
By, Dad.

31:44.580 --> 31:46.070
-I'll see you later.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.560
What about some fruit?

31:50.570 --> 31:51.559
Pretzels?

31:51.570 --> 31:52.559
Fruit.

31:52.570 --> 31:53.559
Take an apple.

31:53.560 --> 31:55.050
You can eat in the car.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.049
We really need to get going.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.049
We're going to be late, OK?

31:57.060 --> 31:57.754
OK.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.040
I can't
find it anywhere.

32:00.050 --> 32:01.540
Did you leave
it in the living room?

32:01.550 --> 32:02.539
I don't know.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.075
Well go look.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.843
-It's not in here.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.249
Look by the
doll house, honey.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.424
Glo Worm!

32:49.000 --> 32:49.967
-He goes alone.

32:49.970 --> 32:51.232
The pool has one entry.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.764
-Do it in the swimming pool.

32:52.770 --> 32:53.998
He's swimming.

32:54.010 --> 32:55.238
He has a heart attack.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.160
-Right.

32:56.170 --> 33:00.903
-You have about an hour,
hour and a half with these.

33:00.910 --> 33:01.911
-These are what?

33:01.920 --> 33:03.194
98% effective?

33:03.200 --> 33:03.894
-You want two?

33:06.880 --> 33:08.006
-Have you seen your daughter?

33:08.010 --> 33:10.240
-She's been moping
around since I got home.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.718
And now she's
locked in her room.

33:12.730 --> 33:16.439
-I told her she's
not gomg to camp.

33:16.450 --> 33:18.509
-You did?

33:18.520 --> 33:20.863
-She was about to forge my
name on the application.

33:20.870 --> 33:23.156
-How do you know?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.388
-Do you not believe me?

33:24.400 --> 33:25.549
-N-- no.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.697
No, of course I believe you.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.692
I just didn't think
Paige would do that.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.338
-You don't know
what she would do.

33:31.340 --> 33:32.602
You know, you are
so easy on her.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.054
She walks all over you.

33:34.060 --> 33:34.754
-That's not true.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.364
-She's going to be
eaten alive out there,

33:36.370 --> 33:38.110
She's never going to be
ready for the real world

33:38.120 --> 33:40.406
if we do not get her ready.

33:40.410 --> 33:41.104
We need to go.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.916
-You know, I told the
police everything I know.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.148
know.

34:37.160 --> 34:40.721
-Well then, what
are you doing here?

34:40.730 --> 34:44.143
-Look, I know this has been
a really hard time, Jared.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.335
I uh, can't imagine what
you're going through.

34:47.340 --> 34:49.535
I'm sorry.

34:49.540 --> 34:51.087
But if it's OK with
you, I would like

34:51.090 --> 34:54.867
to ask you a few more questions
about your mom and dad.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.992
-To help you find the
people who killed them?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.979
-Exactly.

35:03.980 --> 35:05.254
-OK.

35:05.260 --> 35:05.954
-Thanks.

35:10.920 --> 35:16.131
Did your parents ever
travel outside the country?

35:16.140 --> 35:21.191
-Um, they want to Paris for
their wedding anniversary once.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.997
They brought me one of
those little Eiffel towers.

35:25.570 --> 35:26.821
-How about friends?

35:26.830 --> 35:31.779
Did they have a lot of
friends or go out a lot?

35:31.790 --> 35:33.052
-They didn't have
big drunken parties,

35:33.060 --> 35:34.061
if that's what you mean.

35:37.350 --> 35:38.806
Yeah, uh, they had friends.

35:42.950 --> 35:51.437
I mean-- yeah, my mom was on the
PTA and my dad coached T-ball.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.802
Yeah, they were
really great parents.

35:59.810 --> 36:01.038
-I bet they were.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.992
But did you ever feel like
there were parts of their life

36:08.000 --> 36:11.640
that you didn't understand
or that were confusing?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.249
-What do you mean?

36:17.250 --> 36:18.069
-I don't know.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.253
Things like secrets.

36:20.260 --> 36:23.138
Or maybe-- maybe they
had place in the house

36:23.140 --> 36:24.209
where they hid things.

36:24.220 --> 36:25.835
-No.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.899
Wha-- what are you trying to
say that they were criminals.

36:27.910 --> 36:28.706
-No, not at all.

36:28.710 --> 36:29.608
-All right, well then what?

36:32.500 --> 36:35.480
-Look, my-- my parents were kind
and they cared about people.

36:35.490 --> 36:39.347
And-- you know, and I know
that because I lived with them.

36:39.350 --> 36:40.897
-Of course you know, Jared.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.931
I'm not doubting
you for a second.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.829
It sound like they were
really great parents.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.779
But it's funny, you know.

36:52.790 --> 36:58.717
When you get older, you realise
that your parents are also

36:58.720 --> 37:02.838
just people like everyone else.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.569
And just like everyone
else in the world,

37:04.580 --> 37:07.663
you can't really know
everything about them.

37:07.670 --> 37:09.570
I mean, we all have
secrets, right?

37:13.950 --> 37:17.169
-My sister Amelia.

37:17.180 --> 37:17.930
She was 14.

37:17.940 --> 37:18.816
Did she have secrets?

37:22.620 --> 37:25.123
-I'll bet she did.

37:25.130 --> 37:28.133
And that's OK.

37:28.140 --> 37:29.903
I'm just hoping that
if I can figure out

37:29.910 --> 37:32.754
some of your parent's
secrets, I might

37:32.760 --> 37:34.227
be able to find
out who did this.

37:43.940 --> 37:46.864
-Yeah, OK.

37:46.870 --> 37:52.445
-So I'm asking, have you ever
seen these people before?

38:07.930 --> 38:11.297
-I've always wondered about
the women in Muslim countries.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.619
Covering themselves up.

38:12.630 --> 38:15.224
Is it shocking to look at me?

38:15.230 --> 38:18.210
I believe
I can carry on.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.569
-Thank you.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.765
-That was beyond expectation.

41:56.770 --> 41:57.896
-What did you expect?

42:17.090 --> 42:19.456
-I would love to convince
JaVId that more frequent trips

42:19.460 --> 42:21.007
to Washington are now necessary.

42:55.730 --> 42:56.719
-I need a drink.

42:59.570 --> 43:00.264
-What are you doing?

43:00.270 --> 43:01.999
-Just pour me a drink, I said!

43:04.400 --> 43:05.094
-OK.

43:15.740 --> 43:16.434
Here.

43:31.820 --> 43:33.276
How could you do this?

43:33.280 --> 43:33.974
-Annelise--

43:33.980 --> 43:37.996
-What kind of man are you?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.183
Ah!

43:39.190 --> 43:40.259
No!

43:40.260 --> 43:41.295
You're a pimp!

43:41.300 --> 43:42.631
You turned me out!

43:42.640 --> 43:43.618
God, I hate you!

43:43.620 --> 43:44.860
I wish I'd never met you.

43:44.870 --> 43:45.564
Stop it!

43:45.570 --> 43:46.537
Let me go!

43:46.540 --> 43:47.791
I'll scream murder!

43:47.800 --> 43:48.494
Ah!

43:55.330 --> 43:57.275
-Listen to me.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.635
Just listen, just listen.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.130
Listen!

44:01.140 --> 44:02.129
Just listen.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.931
You don't think it kills
me to watch the woman I

44:18.940 --> 44:22.319
love sacrifice
herself like that?

44:22.330 --> 44:23.888
Give herself to another man?

44:23.890 --> 44:27.417
Even if it was _for a cause
bigger than either of us.

44:27.420 --> 44:30.821
It is not something
I take lightly ever.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.988
-I know.

44:38.990 --> 44:39.684
I'm sorry.

44:49.380 --> 44:50.074
I'm sorry.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.907
-Hello?

45:37.910 --> 45:40.128
-Hey, is Bobby there?

45:40.130 --> 45:41.939
-Bobby who?

45:41.940 --> 45:43.589
-Aw, I'm sorry, darling.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.680
I must have the wrong number.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.314
-Javid?

46:57.280 --> 46:58.076
-What about Annelise?

47:11.490 --> 47:12.650
-They'll smell it.
