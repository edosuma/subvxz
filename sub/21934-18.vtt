WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.037
Kid, we'll run out of time!

00:03.071 --> 00:05.773
We'll make it; you'll drive
lead, Walter will follow west

00:05.806 --> 00:09.177
on Venice Boulevard
at exactly 42 miles an hour.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.411
We got to go faster.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.047
No, I timed all the lights;
you'll coast through the greens.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.682
There's construction
on Normandie.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.651
Then take Hobart,
and turn left on 11th.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.254
No, take Olympic.
Potholes on 11th slow traffic.

00:20.288 --> 00:23.324
You know, you could be
more involved in this.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.127
Well, one, with Paige busy
at the FBI seminar,

00:26.160 --> 00:28.562
my hands are full
doing our accounts.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.165
Yes, that's right,
a man with a 197 IQ

00:31.199 --> 00:32.666
is balancing
a checkbook.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.802
And two, we're not
racing humanitarian aid

00:34.835 --> 00:35.836
across a war zone.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.273
We are transporting sperm
across Los Angeles.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.674
CABE:
Not just any sperm.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.609
Toby's sperm.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.377
Is that supposed
to make it more enticing?

00:43.411 --> 00:45.513
We just want to make sure
it gets there safely.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.781
This mission could
finally make the Quintis duo

00:47.815 --> 00:49.417
a trio.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.784
And if everybody
does their jobs,

00:50.818 --> 00:52.286
we can make their first crack

00:52.320 --> 00:54.222
at artificial insemination
their last.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.323
So...

00:55.356 --> 01:00.294
have you heard from Toby
on... his sample production?

01:00.328 --> 01:03.164
No. Not yet.
You know, this is absurd.

01:03.197 --> 01:07.235
There are rooms in fertility
clinics for such... endeavors,

01:07.268 --> 01:10.104
stocked with prurient films
and periodicals.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.240
Why must he do this at home?

01:12.273 --> 01:14.142
Toby insists
that his sexy swimmers--

01:14.175 --> 01:15.276
his term, not mine--

01:15.309 --> 01:18.279
be fabricated in an environment
where he is comfortable,

01:18.312 --> 01:20.348
and he's not comfortable
doing his thing--

01:20.381 --> 01:21.715
God, this is gross--

01:21.749 --> 01:23.884
with office personnel
right down the hall.

01:23.917 --> 01:28.322
He thinks if he's uptight,
then his...

01:28.356 --> 01:30.158
work product

01:30.191 --> 01:32.226
will not be as good
as it can be,

01:32.260 --> 01:33.527
and that will compromise
fertilization.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.230
That is superstition.
That is beneath Toby.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.399
And I didn't think anything
was beneath Toby.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.401
CABE: They've been having
a run of bad luck.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.271
Maybe the superstition gives
him a sense of control.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.805
(phone chiming)

01:44.838 --> 01:48.209
Ooh. It's time
for BrainForm.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.278
The brainteaser app?
I saw the ad.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.146
Didn't look too hard.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.847
Yeah, for us normals,

01:53.881 --> 01:56.250
these puzzles help
keep our minds sharp.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.253
And this timed maze is a bear.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.821
WALTER: Maze puzzles
don't improve

02:00.854 --> 02:03.557
brain function, they just make
you better at solving mazes.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.227
Which has zero practical
application unless you're a rat.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.496
Cabe, if you want
a challenge,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.664
help us connect
to the Cassiopeia VI.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.800
Walt and I call her Cassie
for short.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.368
What the hell's a Cassie?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.737
WALTER: NASA satellite
decommissioned in 1963,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.406
but civilians can apply
for the right

02:18.439 --> 02:19.507
to establish their own links.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.209
We're able to monitor
solar storms.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.344
I'll stick to the mazes.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.845
Your loss.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.381
(phone dings)

02:27.415 --> 02:29.317
Oh, this is from Toby.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.752
"Head over.
Starting sample procurement."

02:31.785 --> 02:35.323
This is my worst workday ever.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.392
And I was once accidentally
blasted into space.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.528
Well, it's time for you
to blast off again.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.695
If you don't leave soon,

02:41.729 --> 02:44.332
then we have to recalculate
the whole traffic matrix.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.366
So go.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.401
Come on.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.539
(door opens, closes)

02:51.572 --> 02:53.307
Yuck.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.409
You know, Ralph,

02:55.443 --> 02:58.979
baby-making isn't
the only labor of love today.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.914
I'm gonna ask Florence out.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.417
Good.
I teed you up nicely.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.419
My wingman game is strong.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.955
Uh, plus, you and Florence
are a logical couple.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.958
Not just logical,
but productive.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.427
In just two weeks,
we've made such great strides

03:13.461 --> 03:15.296
on my water filtration program
for West Altadenia.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.398
But before
I ask her out,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.800
green or...

03:19.833 --> 03:21.335
PAIGE:
Red!

03:21.369 --> 03:22.436
(tires screech)

03:22.470 --> 03:24.438
It was yellow.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.906
Yeah, like, four seconds ago.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.475
(car horns honking)

03:27.508 --> 03:29.943
So the seminar went well.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.912
Tell the feds
the next ballistics workshop

03:31.945 --> 03:33.381
better have bagels.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.350
Okay. Will do.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.885
(horns honking)

03:37.918 --> 03:41.355
Oh, this traffic is a sign.
Of what?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.491
That I shouldn't be going
to this stupid appointment.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.625
"Stupid appointment"?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.660
This is a big day.
Stay positive.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.029
Yeah, it's hard to stay
positive when I got out of bed

03:49.062 --> 03:50.698
and I stepped on
a socket wrench,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.966
then that FBI rookie
spilled coffee on me,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.002
and now we're gonna be late--
all signs.

03:55.035 --> 03:55.969
No.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.705
No, they're just accidents.
We're gonna get

03:57.738 --> 03:59.507
to the clinic on time;
so will the guys.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.409
You're nervous.
You don't feel ready

04:01.442 --> 04:02.510
to have a baby;
that's normal.

04:02.543 --> 04:06.046
Trust me, I am sure Toby
does not feel ready either.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.881
I've never felt more ready.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.885
Per doctor's orders, I've taken
my kilos of vitamins,

04:11.919 --> 04:13.654
I've done daily cardio

04:13.687 --> 04:16.590
and I've made healthy dietary
adjustments, all for this.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.058
I call this

04:18.091 --> 04:19.126
a steampunk blimp.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.529
This was designed
by none other than Happy Quinn.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.397
It's a stainless steel,
shockproof,

04:23.431 --> 04:26.434
cold and heat-resistant
sample protector.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.469
Zygote, here we come.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.003
All right.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.572
We have 56 minutes
until the handoff,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.541
and I'm not providing
a top quality product,

04:33.574 --> 04:35.275
so we can't be
late with delivery.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.512
Mush.
I'm not a dog.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.547
(horn honking)

04:39.580 --> 04:41.081
Would you two quit bickering?!

04:41.114 --> 04:43.083
We're on the clock
to make a baby!

04:43.116 --> 04:44.452
Andale!

04:44.485 --> 04:45.653
(tires screeching)

04:49.557 --> 04:52.560
Red is the color
of strength and confidence.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.094
From observing
Florence's style preferences,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.096
as well as the paint color
of her lab,

04:56.129 --> 04:57.731
red is a nonstarter.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.500
It's all about the lilac.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.034
Lilac.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.707
All right.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.108
Perfect.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.276
Morning!

05:09.309 --> 05:12.646
I had a radical idea about
increasing the surface area

05:12.680 --> 05:14.615
of the carbon scrubbers.
Hello, Ralph.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.916
RALPH:
Uh, morning.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.385
(horn honking outside)

05:17.418 --> 05:19.587
Oh. My ride.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.088
You got this.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.559
(door opens)

05:25.593 --> 05:27.828
Oh, boy.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.830
Are you ready to get started?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.832
Yessiree, Bob.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.602
Not that your name is Bob.
I know it's Florence.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.136
(chuckles):
What? Um...

05:36.169 --> 05:37.104
Anyway.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.773
You know, I figured
since we're gonna be doing

05:39.807 --> 05:42.109
so much work here,
we'll probably get hungry, so...

05:42.142 --> 05:44.878
would you want to grab a bite
at Kovelsky's later?

05:44.912 --> 05:47.915
Great. Sounds like a plan.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.054
Sweet. You got this.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.656
You got this.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.526
(engine revving)

05:58.559 --> 05:59.893
Yeah. Nice.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.495
How are we
looking on time?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.497
Uh, 49 minutes,
43 seconds.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.998
Great. Quick pit stop.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.967
TOBY: Whoa, whoa, Walt.
Walt, Walt, what are you doing?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.502
CABE:
All that precision planning,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.003
and you're calling an audible?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.573
This is the most
important day of my life.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.775
You're gonna blow it
by going to the ATM?
I only use tellers.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.877
ATMs are magnets
for hackers and thieves.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.146
We had a plan.
Yes, and the plan included

06:19.179 --> 06:21.815
extra time for pileups,
natural disasters

06:21.849 --> 06:24.518
and spontaneous parades,
none of which are happening.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.119
Now, the clinic is 12
minutes away. We're fine.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.789
Whoa, whoa, Walt, we are so far
from fine, it's not funny.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.624
Are you concerned that
I'm gonna walk under a ladder

06:30.658 --> 06:32.192
or cross paths with a black cat?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.562
What does that mean?
This whole plan is

06:34.595 --> 06:36.864
predicated on superstition,
and I am not subscribing to it

06:36.897 --> 06:39.132
in lieu of running
an efficient company.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.469
In fact...
All right, enough.
Look, five minutes.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.571
And no unplanned transactions,
no small talk.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.972
Okay.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.510
You know that
me and the missus have

06:49.543 --> 06:51.011
planned this procedure
to the minute.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.813
The stars have
aligned perfectly,

06:52.846 --> 06:55.949
from the octane of my petrol
to the timing of Happy's ovum.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.518
Dr. Brown University says

06:57.551 --> 06:59.219
we're not gonna have
another chance this good

06:59.252 --> 07:01.655
for impregnation for
five months minimum, if ever.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.491
We will be done in no time.

07:03.524 --> 07:07.227
Really? It seems like
we're standing here right now.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.763
Uh, excuse me, do you think,
uh, he could help us?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.701
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr. O'Brien.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.102
Actually, we don't
have a moment.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.003
WALTER:
I am sorry, Stevie.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.772
My friend is a little
frazzled today.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.609
I'm not frazzled,
I'm just annoyed, at you.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.976
Uh, Stevie, my man,

07:23.010 --> 07:26.146
uh, we're on a bit
of a schedule here, so...

07:32.152 --> 07:34.087
How can I help you?

07:34.121 --> 07:37.257
A cash withdrawal, um, $800.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.528
500 in tens,
and 300 in 20s, please.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.695
Scorpion corporate account.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.798
Right away.
How are you today?

07:44.832 --> 07:46.834
I'm fine.
He's selfish.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.638
(phone ringing)

07:57.945 --> 07:59.947
(phone continues ringing)

08:01.749 --> 08:04.051
STEVIE:
Okay, there you go.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.520
You have a nice day.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.726
Sorry, I'm a trainee.
First day.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.096
(phone continues ringing)

08:18.999 --> 08:20.734
Walt, I got a bad
feeling. Let's go.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.135
No, why don't you wait
in the car.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.304
And be careful
of the cracks in the asphalt

08:24.337 --> 08:27.007
so you don't injure
your mother's back. (scoffs)

08:30.678 --> 08:33.180
You're all set.
Thank you.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.084
In and out. See? Easy.

08:37.117 --> 08:40.554
Walt, Walt, just walk naturally,
but this is a bank robbery.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.922
That's not funny.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.691
He's right, Doc;
that's like yelling "fire"

08:43.724 --> 08:45.025
in a crowded theatre.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.661
Monitors are off, and I
bet the cameras are, too.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.262
When's the last
time you saw

08:49.296 --> 08:51.732
a 45-year-old dude training
to be a bank teller?

08:51.765 --> 08:52.900
(gun clicks)

08:52.933 --> 08:54.668
STEVIE:
Stop right there.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.604
Now, turn around.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.245
You know, if this is
how you act as a trainee,

09:05.278 --> 09:07.280
you're never gonna make teller.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.026
Okay, guys, remain cool.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.662
You don't want them
getting spooked.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.030
All right, let's get them
to the break room,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.598
and help the guys with the cash.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.133
Okay. Let's go.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.735
Oh, no, no, I've got
an impotent appointment

09:27.768 --> 09:29.603
of the utmost importance;
I'm not going anywhere, guys.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.904
Move your ass.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.640
Come on, I don't care
if you rob the bank.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.241
I mean, it's federally insured.
Who gets hurt, right?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.611
Crap, we have company.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.380
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're closed.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.749
The computers are down.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.618
We'll be open by
lunchtime, all right?

09:44.652 --> 09:45.653
(lock clicks)

09:45.686 --> 09:47.254
That's a problem.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.722
Why? She left.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.390
Why? Because how many
more people come by,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.325
find their bank is locked
before they become suspicious?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.728
Mr. O'Brien,
you guys just screwed us.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.063
Take their phones.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.301
You sure that's necessary?

10:01.334 --> 10:04.705
Less people see an empty room,
less chance they call the cops.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.741
Too late.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.742
Okay, fellas, listen up.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.411
We now have 20 minutes
to do a 90-minute job,

10:11.444 --> 10:14.815
so I'm shutting down the front,
'cause I need all hands on deck.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.217
What kind of bank robbers
spend 90 minutes in a bank?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.687
Most heists are over
in less than 90 seconds.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.754
Okay, let's move.

10:20.788 --> 10:21.889
CABE: Fellas, I'm gonna need
all the information

10:21.922 --> 10:24.792
that you can give me so I know
what we're dealing with.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.060
But be slick. Don't let 'em know
that you're comm'd up.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.329
You're taking us this way,
down the back hall?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.964
Yeah, right where
I'm pointing, Einstein.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.003
Come on.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.839
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

10:41.975 --> 10:43.777
Police scanner, huh?

10:43.811 --> 10:46.213
Monitoring LAPD?
Smart.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.981
That is smart.
Anybody calls in the robbery,

10:48.015 --> 10:49.717
the bad guys
will have a heads up.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.887
NATE:
Come on, move.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.355
What happened to this guy?

10:55.388 --> 10:58.125
It's an employee break room,
not a break-an-employee room.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.193
It's all right,
I'm a doctor.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.230
Ow!

11:03.263 --> 11:04.464
His nose is fractured.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.434
Jason tried to be a hero.
He's not so brave now.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.237
CABE: Well, at least now we know
they're not above violence.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.105
Don't do anything
to ramp 'em up.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.708
You can't just lock
the eight of us in here.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.876
Watch me.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.781
(lock clicks)

11:20.814 --> 11:22.716
Okay, Cabe, did you get that?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.752
There's six hostages in here,
plus me and Toby.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.887
And all the little Tobys
in my pocket,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.455
which are now
several minutes behind

11:28.488 --> 11:30.791
on their delivery schedule,
which means Happy's gonna be

11:30.824 --> 11:33.761
several months behind
on her delivery schedule.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.896
Um, who are you guys talking to?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.264
We're government contractors

11:37.297 --> 11:39.332
with tiny communication devices
in our ears

11:39.366 --> 11:41.501
that allow us to connect with
our colleagues on the outside.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.337
We're gonna keep you safe.
No one is gonna die.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.073
TOBY: Except for the
millions of sperm

11:46.106 --> 11:48.408
that are slowly withering
away in my pocket.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.791
Looking sly, Sly.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.458
Looking sly.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.862
(cell phone ringing)

12:08.896 --> 12:12.132
Cabe, you could not have called
at a more inopportune time.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.167
What do you want?

12:16.837 --> 12:19.139
Walter, Toby, hostages,
sperm sample!

12:19.172 --> 12:20.340
What?

12:20.373 --> 12:22.309
Walter and Toby
stopped at a bank

12:22.342 --> 12:24.077
on their way
to the fertility clinic,

12:24.111 --> 12:26.179
and it's getting robbed.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.348
All right, guys,
I am on comms,

12:28.381 --> 12:30.283
you're on speaker,
and Florence is with me.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.986
Cabe, can you please
hurry up with a plan?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.487
'Cause in 44 minutes,

12:34.521 --> 12:37.791
Happy's procedure
becomes a no-cedure.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.426
As soon as Sly gives me
the satellite feed

12:39.459 --> 12:41.494
I asked him for.
SYLVESTER: Done.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.996
I've got a ten-block
radius around the bank.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.098
What am I looking for?
CABE: Cop cars.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.900
You need to contact LAPD,

12:46.934 --> 12:49.536
have them call
any squad car in the area

12:49.569 --> 12:52.539
and tell them not to respond
to any calls to that bank

12:52.572 --> 12:54.241
until I give them the word.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.110
And they have to do it all
by cell phone, not walkie.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.913
Hold on, you want
the police to stay back?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.381
I thought during a bank robbery

13:01.414 --> 13:03.083
you want the cops
to be around.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.352
If the bad guys hear
that the cops are around,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.287
the danger to the hostages
goes up.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.957
Sly, are there
any LAPD cars in the area?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.224
Three in a
six-block radius.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.259
What are the numbers

13:12.292 --> 13:13.460
on the roof of their cars?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.864
481, 572, 393.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.198
I'll contact LAPD.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.433
You call Happy and Paige
and fill them in.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.470
Sly, you and I both know that
Happy is gonna be very upset.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.272
She's full of anxiety
and hormone boosters.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.040
So, when you relay
this information to her,

13:27.074 --> 13:29.977
it's very important that you
make sure that she understands

13:30.010 --> 13:32.980
that this is all Walter's fault.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.314
I'm gonna kill O'Brien.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.916
What exactly
is the problem?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.885
Call him up.
He'll fill you in.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.953
Walter, what's going on?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.489
I'm sorry, but could you please
take your calls outside?

13:42.522 --> 13:45.425
You're what?!
See? Don't tell me
this isn't a sign.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.560
Does appear to be sign-like.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.097
Okay, Doc, I'm gonna come
break out you and your swimmers.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.932
No, no, no.
Sweetie, sweetie, that's unwise.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
There's nothing you can do,
and then I'd just have to

13:54.201 --> 13:56.904
bring you and my bodacious
batter to the doctor's office.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.038
So, how about you stay
where you are?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.073
Fine. But I'm getting
eyes on you.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.945
Please, you cannot go in there.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.113
Okay, Gretchen,
you're a nice girl,

14:06.146 --> 14:07.915
but I've got one foot in the air

14:07.948 --> 14:09.316
and I'm looking for
an ass to kick.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.890
(beeping)
HAPPY: Damn it.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.358
I can hack into
anything that's on,

14:18.391 --> 14:20.360
but the security
cameras are off.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.963
I'll find a workaround,
but I need bank schematics.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.497
HAPPY: Sly?
Already on it.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.333
All right,
I just got off with LAPD.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.935
They're gonna be here
any minute,

14:27.968 --> 14:29.336
and they know that Homeland's
running point.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.905
Sylvester, look.

14:31.939 --> 14:37.177
Uh... guys, there is a truck
approaching the bank

14:37.210 --> 14:40.113
by a side door in the alley.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.383
The siding on the truck is for
a carpet cleaning business.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.985
That is their cover.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.319
And it looks like
they're offloading

14:46.353 --> 14:48.355
chemical drums and
putting them into the bank.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.958
They could be using the drums
to move the money out.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.260
True, or the drums are
full of chemicals

14:53.293 --> 14:55.996
to make bomb and blow the whole
building when they're done,

14:56.029 --> 14:57.297
destroying any evidence.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.066
If that's the shot,
the plan changes.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.534
We may hand this off to SWAT
sooner rather than later.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.303
Damn it, we need eyes
five minutes ago.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.504
Sly, where are my schematics?

15:04.537 --> 15:05.973
Coming right up.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.474
HAPPY:
Got 'em.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.076
Okay, let's see here.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.644
Okay, these are old;
give me a beat

15:11.678 --> 15:13.080
to look them over.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.518
Pete!
Gallo.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.454
I know you to be an ornery
bastard, but not a reckless man.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.091
You want to tell me what
the hell's going on here?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.026
These guys aren't wearing masks,
which means they don't care

15:26.059 --> 15:27.294
if they get their picture taken.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.463
Sly, see what you can
find out about them.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.633
Now, the leader is a bank
employee, first name Steven.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.734
Last name Petersen.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.004
He's not a career criminal,
but his brother Nate is.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.539
TOBY:
Yeah, he's with Nate right now.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.641
If they don't care that we see
them, they're headed somewhere

15:41.674 --> 15:43.010
where the authorities
can't touch them.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.144
SYLVESTER:
Already ahead of you.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.013
Searching for private flights
at local airports now.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.147
FLORENCE:
There.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.984
A Petersen chartered a private
jet from Burbank tonight,

15:51.018 --> 15:53.220
headed to Vanuatu
in the South Pacific.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.023
No extradition treaty
with the U.S.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.390
Toby, I can't get
the cameras on,

15:57.424 --> 16:00.027
but I can guide you
to the place where you can.

16:01.094 --> 16:05.165
Junction box is 13.4 feet ahead
to the south.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.001
Crawl softly
and they won't hear crap

16:08.035 --> 16:09.702
inside that soundproof vault.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.504
Crawl loudly and
you're dead meat.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.342
(quietly):
All right, I'm almost there.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.212
All right, Hap, what do I do?

16:19.246 --> 16:22.349
Now you're gonna power up the
cameras only, not the monitors.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.017
Otherwise, they'll know
something is up.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.386
In the junction box
are grouped wires.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.322
Standard configuration
is blue, yellow and green.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.025
Kill the green; that'll kill
power to the monitors.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.761
Then I want you to wind
the blue and yellow.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.231
And we have eyes up.
Okay, Cabe, we're looking at

16:38.265 --> 16:39.166
four of them in the vault.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.234
FLORENCE:
Plus the driver in the truck.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.436
He hasn't gotten out yet.
That's five total.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.205
Man, your team's solid.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.673
I'm gonna head down.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.242
I don't want to fall through
the ceiling and spill my semen.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.182
I can explain.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.683
Good news is the drums
aren't full of chemicals;

16:56.716 --> 16:57.950
they're filling them with money.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.787
And I just solved the mystery as
to why they're taking so long.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.789
They're removing
the hidden dye packs

17:02.822 --> 17:04.424
from every stack of cash.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.825
Dye packs are the things
that explode

17:05.858 --> 17:07.127
and ruin the stolen money?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.361
WALTER:
It's not just dye.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.531
The packs contain a chemical
mixture of aerosolized tear gas

17:11.564 --> 17:14.601
designed to cause severe
eye and lung irritation.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.703
Taking out every single
dye pack is time consuming,

17:16.736 --> 17:19.306
but it's a good way to
ensure that you get away

17:19.339 --> 17:21.308
with clear eyes
and clean money.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.476
Got to be at least ten million.
SYLVESTER: Actually, I've hacked

17:23.510 --> 17:25.712
into the bank's camera feed,
and based on stack size,

17:25.745 --> 17:28.315
a more accurate estimate
is 10.89 million.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.250
Why would a mom-and-pop
savings and loan

17:30.283 --> 17:31.351
be holding this much cash?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.819
Guys, guys, of course.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.088
The stakes at the Santa Susana
racetrack are this weekend.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.356
That's just a mile from here.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.291
That track probably
uses this bank,

17:38.325 --> 17:41.161
and they called in all that cash
to cover the action.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.629
Something Stevie would know
was gonna happen.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.664
HAPPY: Okay, let me tell you
what's not gonna happen.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.167
Me getting knocked-up if
you guys don't get out of there

17:47.200 --> 17:49.736
and get me Toby's goods
in 37 minutes.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.238
WALTER:
Happy, as soon as

17:51.271 --> 17:53.306
we figure something out,
the whole team

17:53.340 --> 17:54.741
will work to get you pregnant.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.414
I think I found a solution.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.682
These old pneumatic tubes,

18:02.715 --> 18:05.285
the one they use for
deposits and withdrawals,

18:05.318 --> 18:07.720
the tellers had them, but is
there one for the drive-through?

18:07.754 --> 18:11.424
Yes, covered by a grate in '02.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.326
If I could just plant the seed
of an idea here.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.527
CABE:
Yeah, well,

18:14.561 --> 18:16.763
if you could plant the seed,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.332
Toby, I don't like where
you're going with this.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.733
TOBY: Sorry, Happy.
We don't have a choice.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.136
The clinic techs have to start
the washing procedure

18:23.170 --> 18:26.139
on my boys in 36 minutes,

18:26.173 --> 18:28.441
or else our little baby
becomes a big maybe.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.910
Happy, we've got everything
riding on this.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.346
A-All the work,
a-all the doctors and the tests,

18:33.380 --> 18:36.683
and that brutal,
brutal abstinence.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.785
Everything's led up
to this moment.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.754
This moment, brought to you
by Walter's selfishness.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.759
You sold me.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.362
Okay, the container is
two-and-a-half inches wide.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.432
Pneumatic tube is four and 1/8.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.634
Theoretically, it could work.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.703
Uh, Cabe, pretty please,
if I get the sample out to you,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.471
can you get it to
the clinic on time?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.373
I don't know, kid.
I can't just take off

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
in the middle of all this.
Oh, hold on.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.712
Look, Cabe, back when Connie
and I couldn't have kids,

19:05.745 --> 19:08.248
the technology
wasn't there for us.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.450
But your friends,
they have a shot.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.353
You got to help them.
We can take it from here.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.855
Okay.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.857
I'm your courier.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.459
I owe you one, Cabe.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.460
Thanks, pal.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.628
PAIGE:
One problem.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.330
The drive-through is
right by the truck.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.332
If the driver sees Cabe
messing around in the back,

19:25.365 --> 19:26.466
that's bad news.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.470
I got an idea.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.971
Excuse me, sir.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.873
On behalf of
the United States government,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.375
I'm commandeering
your wiener dog.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.409
(dog barks)

19:37.744 --> 19:39.579
HAPPY:
According to the schematics,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.514
the metal grate is next to

19:41.548 --> 19:44.284
what is now
the drive-through ATM.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.519
Opposite side of the bank
from the alley

19:46.553 --> 19:48.988
and not visible from inside.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.558
While Cabe removes the grate,
Toby accesses the tube

19:51.591 --> 19:55.194
through a service hatch
and switches on the fan.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.967
(grunts)

20:01.000 --> 20:05.438
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna send
a piece of wood on a test run.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.380
(air whooshing)

20:15.482 --> 20:16.516
(dog barks)

20:17.550 --> 20:18.851
All right, Doc.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.853
It worked like a charm.
Let her rip.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.623
Fly, my little aquamen, fly.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.492
Actually, aquamen
would swim.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.527
Hawkman would fly.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.529
And a plethora
of other heroes. (scoffs)

20:29.562 --> 20:32.532
Indeed.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.001
(air whooshing)

20:35.034 --> 20:36.536
(quiet thump)

20:36.569 --> 20:38.004
You hear that?

20:39.972 --> 20:41.874
What are you waiting for?
Send it.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.476
I did.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.944
Doc, I'm waiting
for your delivery,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.313
but nothing's happening.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.914
Now you know how I feel.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.982
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The canister's stuck?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.052
Doesn't mean it's a sign.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.388
Guys, I'm coming down.
This is bad.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.463
This is worse.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.772
There's no way out up here.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.377
TOBY: Guys, it was a shot
in the dark. I'm just a dope.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.811
I'm just a scared dope.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.315
Try escaping again
and this escalates.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.552
Stevie. You were always
such a good boy.

21:25.585 --> 21:29.055
Why don't you just take
whatever money you have

21:29.088 --> 21:31.057
and let us go?

21:31.090 --> 21:32.825
I can't do that,
Mrs. Sanders.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.994
Just sit tight
and you'll be fine.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.028
Promise.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.502
(lock clicks)

21:42.535 --> 21:44.404
TOBY:
Oh, look at the time.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.072
We got 31 minutes left

21:46.105 --> 21:48.441
and my stallion battalion's
stuck who knows where.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.676
HAPPY:
I know where.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.612
I'd bet my wrench hand it got
stuck at that junction point

21:52.645 --> 21:54.847
behind the wall,
right next to the bank vault.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.049
If there was warping
from disuse,

21:57.083 --> 21:59.552
junctions like that would be
the first areas compromised.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.120
The turn was too tight.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.855
Happy, I think that's it.
It's over.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.392
I-I failed us. I failed you.
I'm a full-blown loser.

22:07.126 --> 22:10.730
Toby, I think you just
solved our problem.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.432
By admitting I'm a loser?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.434
No. Full-blown.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.102
We're gonna blow
the dye packs.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.372
SYLVESTER: Walter, they are
removing all of the dye packs.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.172
How does that help us?

22:20.206 --> 22:21.841
If all the dye packs
in the vault

22:21.874 --> 22:24.411
explode at once, it will
have enough concussive force

22:24.444 --> 22:27.647
to knock out the thieves and
jostle Toby's sample loose.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.882
That is an ambitious, dangerous

22:29.916 --> 22:31.684
and crazy plan!

22:31.718 --> 22:32.752
Listen to me.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.487
This whole situation
is my fault,

22:34.521 --> 22:35.955
from being in the stickup

22:35.988 --> 22:38.157
to endangering Happy and Toby's
fertility success.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.493
I have to fix this.
Hang on.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.562
How you gonna get
the dye packs to go off?

22:42.595 --> 22:44.096
Well, they're radio frequency
controlled,

22:44.130 --> 22:47.066
so Sly and Florence can build
a remote RF trigger.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.902
Well, I can use my ham radio
from my go-bag as a base.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.905
But in order to get
a detonation signal to the bank,

22:52.939 --> 22:54.941
we will need
a significant signal boost.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.042
WALTER:
Modify the antenna

22:56.075 --> 22:59.111
Ralph and I built to communicate
with Cassiopeia VI.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.448
Okay, we'll need the serial
number for that run of dye packs

23:01.481 --> 23:02.281
and the frequency data.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.884
Toby, you'll pick the lock
on that door

23:04.917 --> 23:06.419
with Laverne's hairpins;
I will grab

23:06.453 --> 23:07.787
the dye pack data
from the vault.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.622
Vault's occupied, genius.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.924
Not when all four
are taking a drum full of cash

23:11.958 --> 23:13.092
out to the truck.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.061
Heavy load requires all hands.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.729
WALTER: Exactly.
Now, Paige and Happy,

23:16.763 --> 23:18.130
time their movements
and give me an average

23:18.164 --> 23:20.700
about how long I will have
to make it to the vault

23:20.733 --> 23:21.801
and back to
the break room safely.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.170
JASON: There is no time
amount to do this safely.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.872
You're gonna get caught.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.040
And then they're gonna
kill all of us.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.076
TOBY: Guys, I don't
want to freak you out,

23:30.109 --> 23:31.711
but did you see how Stevie
couldn't look Laverne

23:31.744 --> 23:33.480
in the eye when he promised
she'd be okay?

23:33.513 --> 23:35.047
That's because he's been
working here for a while;

23:35.081 --> 23:36.883
he's gotten to know you
as coworkers,

23:36.916 --> 23:38.485
and he was lying to you.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.021
They're gonna kill all of us
when they're done.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.056
They're gonna
leave no witnesses,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.091
and then they're
gonna get on a plane,

23:45.124 --> 23:46.025
and they're
gonna get lost.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.127
We have no option
but to try this plan.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.996
PAIGE: Fine, but how are you
and Walt gonna do anything

23:50.029 --> 23:51.464
if you're bound in duct tape?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.142
We're gonna die here today.

24:03.175 --> 24:06.145
Okay, now the sample
container is shockproof,

24:06.178 --> 24:08.981
but I didn't account for the
force of a thousand dye packs.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.183
There needs to be cushioning
in the tube.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.720
What do you people
eat around here?

24:13.753 --> 24:15.021
You don't have
any, like, bread

24:15.054 --> 24:16.088
or marshmallows?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.057
Oh, popcorn.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.859
Popcorn's perfect.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.094
Those dye packs burn
at, like, 400 degrees.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.696
So the kernels will
surround the sample.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.732
Then once they're hit
with the heat blast,

24:25.765 --> 24:27.199
they're gonna pop instantly.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.869
27 minutes and nine seconds

24:29.902 --> 24:32.004
till my sample's
no longer ample.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.506
Doc, you got the sample
stuck the first time.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.641
Don't blow it again.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.676
Ah, there's the support
I'm looking for.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.546
Guys, how are we
looking on time?

24:39.579 --> 24:41.881
HAPPY: We'll have
a workable average for you

24:41.914 --> 24:43.550
after they make one more trip.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.888
Three teams
here, here and here

24:48.921 --> 24:51.157
with four men in this corner
to take the front door.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.159
Actually, I think
this is the ideal spot

24:53.192 --> 24:54.260
for the front door approach.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.196
Except we can't get there
while staying out of sight.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.064
You got to treat
it like a maze.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.099
Take this alley
through the back door

25:00.132 --> 25:01.133
of the restaurant here.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.035
Emerge catty-corner
from the bank at Serrano.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.571
Impressive route.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.873
BrainForm.
You should try it.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.541
Now get your men in position.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.777
You heard the man. Let's roll.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.086
(clears throat)
Hey.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.655
Comms out for a second.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.228
Toby is trying his best.
Maybe try a little tenderness.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.097
I know, I know.
I hear myself.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.133
Scary thing is, I am actually
trying to be comforting.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.735
You're nervous.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.004
Or I'm not wired for it
or for being a mom.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.006
You ever think of that?
You are.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.140
You've been enthusiastically
trying for months.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.308
Why the sudden change of heart?

25:42.341 --> 25:43.776
Because now it's real.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.144
I can be pregnant

25:45.177 --> 25:45.945
within an hour.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.247
And if I love Toby
as much as I do

25:48.280 --> 25:50.116
and I still don't know
how to treat him,

25:50.149 --> 25:52.351
why would it be
any different with a kid?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.253
That's why all the signs
are correct,

25:54.286 --> 25:56.989
'cause I don't have
what it takes to be a mom.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.557
I'm not you, Paige.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.031
They finished another run.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.033
Okay, I got your timing, Walt.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.969
24 seconds on average
to get to the vault and back.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.838
That's not
a lot of cushion.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.906
No, but this is.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.743
(air whooshing)

26:18.410 --> 26:21.147
Now a little popcorn.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.952
(air whooshing)

26:25.985 --> 26:27.053
Popcorn's in position.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.187
Are the cops?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.388
Affirmative.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.257
Okay, they're about
ready to do

26:31.290 --> 26:33.225
a drum run out to the truck.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.869
In three, two, one. Go!

26:42.902 --> 26:46.138
24, 23... Come on, boss.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.341
Yeah.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.344
(blows)

26:53.079 --> 26:54.180
FLORENCE:
Serial number

26:54.213 --> 26:58.718
P-6-2-5-7-A-9-2-3-6-Q

26:58.751 --> 27:00.753
at a frequency
of 52.525 megahertz.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.755
I'm inputting that data

27:02.789 --> 27:06.158
into the system panel
of our RF trigger.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.927
And done.
Let's go to the roof.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.028
PAIGE:
Get out of there.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.262
You've got 14 seconds.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.331
No, he doesn't.
They're early.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.800
PAIGE:
Walter, you got to hide.

27:13.833 --> 27:14.834
Wait.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.069
Why was your averaging off?
That's basic math.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.738
HAPPY:
They forgot their lift straps.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.773
They can't get the drums up
onto the truck without them.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.077
Okay, when they're inside,
blow the packs.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.679
No, you'll be in there
with the blast.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.748
This drum's
polyethylene plastic.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.050
It'll protect me. Maybe.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.788
Take the straps.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.090
I'm gonna stay here
and keep packing.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.359
We got to move.
Come on.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.165
CABE: Walt, when
that blast goes off,

27:46.198 --> 27:47.199
we're gonna be coming in hot,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.101
so you stay in that barrel
as long as possible.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.102
WALTER (quietly):
Understood.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.738
Sly?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.372
We're connecting now.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.874
We most certainly are.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.443
Okay. All set.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.714
Connecting to the dye
packs frequency now.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.451
HAPPY: They're all back
in the vault. Sly, you ready?

28:05.484 --> 28:08.855
Triggering the blast... now!

28:10.957 --> 28:12.725
Nothing.
TOBY: Nothing is a problem!

28:12.759 --> 28:13.760
Hit it again!

28:13.793 --> 28:15.762
We don't have
any connection.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.229
Something must be
blocking the signal.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.065
Well, figure it out because
it's only a matter of time

28:19.098 --> 28:21.133
till they open that drum
and find Walter.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.278
Sly, if you boofed
the electronics,

28:32.311 --> 28:34.013
you'll get my claw hammer
around your neck.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.248
The signal should be
more than strong enough.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.250
Walter and Ralph built it to
talk to a friggin' satellite!

28:38.284 --> 28:39.786
Just get it to work.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.020
Yelling makes me nervous.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.091
I'm a chemist.
Kind of flying blind here, okay?

28:45.124 --> 28:47.359
Blind. That's it. Blind!

28:47.393 --> 28:49.361
Or more accurately, blinds.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.964
I've been to Walter's bank.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.099
Doesn't it have blinds
on the windows?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.767
Yes, and lovely
faux wood paneling.

28:54.801 --> 28:55.968
Who gives a carton of crap?!

28:56.002 --> 28:56.969
(quietly):
There are blinds.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.504
They pulled them down.
SYLVESTER: That's it.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.139
They got to
open the blinds.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.273
They're blocking
our signal!

29:01.307 --> 29:04.076
I'm gonna hack away to monitor
the signal's reception.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.247
Hang on. We're seriously getting
derailed by window blinds?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.282
SYLVESTER:
Yes, they cause interference

29:10.316 --> 29:12.852
for radio signals
of this size and strength.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.087
He's right. In the early days
of broadcasting football games,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.957
they'd ask all
the buildings downtown

29:17.990 --> 29:19.025
to keep their blinds open
on Sundays

29:19.058 --> 29:22.061
to allow for easier transmission
of the broadcast.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.996
Thank you for
the fascinating history lesson

29:24.030 --> 29:25.197
at a completely
inappropriate time.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.332
Does somebody want to tell me

29:26.365 --> 29:29.068
who's gonna go to the bank floor
and open those blinds?!

29:29.101 --> 29:31.303
I can do it.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.973
It's a short run, and I can
find a hiding spot there.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.208
Yeah, well, you're not
exactly mobile.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.244
I just need to find a way out.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.578
And so do my tiny dancers.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.947
HAPPY:
Focus!

29:40.980 --> 29:42.982
We can't get Walt
out of the drum

29:43.015 --> 29:45.284
till we get them
out of the vault.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.421
I have an idea.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.529
Hey. Excuse me.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.098
Hey, you.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.266
Can I help you?
Yeah.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.101
You can move
your damn truck.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.569
I came by here earlier

30:03.602 --> 30:06.138
and was gonna give you a pass,
but you're still here.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.140
I'm working, buddy.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.077
CABE:
There's no commercial parking
here per the block association.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.245
I got a bar around the corner
and my delivery guy

30:13.279 --> 30:15.147
can't get through.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.350
You know, it's twice a week
I got to deal with this.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.152
Now, you want me
to call the cops?

30:20.186 --> 30:22.321
STEVIE: Denton,
get rid of this guy, quietly.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.324
Why don't you go play
with your dog?

30:25.357 --> 30:28.127
My dog is in the bar,
and my foot

30:28.160 --> 30:30.629
is gonna be up your ass
if you don't move this truck.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.333
Suggest you shove off.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.570
CABE:
Oh, yeah?

30:38.604 --> 30:40.239
Or what, tough guy?

30:40.272 --> 30:43.375
Come on, guys. We got
a problem at the truck.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.179
PAIGE:
Cabe, you got their attention.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.547
They're leaving the vault.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.382
Walter, get ready to move.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.521
They're out of the vault
and down the hall. Go!

31:06.332 --> 31:07.934
Walter, the lobby's clear.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.636
Cabe, they're almost at
the door. Get out of there.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.939
WALTER:
Cabe, I'm clear.

31:12.972 --> 31:16.242
Look, man,
just turn around and leave.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.644
You know what?
To hell with you.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.546
I'm gonna take this up
with my alderman.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.185
He's gone.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.989
We've wasted time we don't have.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.393
Hurry up. I'll start
on the last barrel.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.402
HAPPY: Walt, hurry.
They're almost done.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.543
TOBY:
My sample only has

31:51.577 --> 31:53.312
12 minutes left,
so if all this works,

31:53.345 --> 31:55.381
we're gonna need to get
to the clinic fast.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.349
Like-like warp speed fast.
CABE: I got a plan.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.118
Are those blinds up yet?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.352
Working on it.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.354
And with every blind
that goes up,

32:02.388 --> 32:04.690
the signal to the dye packs
should be getting stronger.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.292
SYLVESTER:
Walt, it's working.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.396
TOBY:
All right, listen.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.431
When I say so, run.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.702
GRETCHEN:
Um, hello.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.505
The doctor is just...
HAPPY and PAIGE: Not now!

32:19.538 --> 32:21.040
SYLVESTER:
We've got the signal!

32:21.073 --> 32:22.574
Okay, done. Sly, Flo, it's...

32:22.608 --> 32:24.343
PAIGE:
(gasps) Walter!

32:34.120 --> 32:36.522
It's what, Walter?!
Should we hit the trigger now?!

32:36.555 --> 32:38.490
No, Walter's in trouble.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.758
The main dirtbag coldcocked him,

32:39.791 --> 32:41.493
and now he's standing
over Walt with a gun.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.528
Cabe, get in there!

32:42.561 --> 32:43.695
CABE:
If we take the bank,

32:43.729 --> 32:45.197
God forbid the guy's got

32:45.231 --> 32:47.399
an itchy trigger finger.
We can't.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.602
HAPPY:
These guys are seconds away

32:50.636 --> 32:53.072
from taking the last drum
of cash out of the vault.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.507
After that, they are
out of range of the dye packs.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.243
If we blow the packs now,

32:57.276 --> 32:59.211
that thug knows something's up
and he could take Walter out.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.112
Cabe, once that money's
loaded up,

33:00.146 --> 33:02.381
they're gonna
come back here and kill us.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.251
STEVIE: Don't move.
We'll be out of here soon.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.559
Do it now.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.028
Are you seriously telling me
to kill you now?

33:16.062 --> 33:17.129
Now, Sly, do it now!

33:17.163 --> 33:18.630
Who's Sly?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.999
Me.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.073
(rapid beeping)

33:32.844 --> 33:34.313
Let's move!

33:41.287 --> 33:43.155
Move, move!

33:43.189 --> 33:44.623
Go, go, go!

33:44.656 --> 33:46.258
Go!

33:51.230 --> 33:53.499
Freeze! Don't move!

33:54.866 --> 33:56.302
Let's go.
(grunts)

33:57.336 --> 33:59.205
Get out of the truck!
Drop the weapon!

33:59.238 --> 34:00.072
(groans)

34:00.106 --> 34:01.640
Freeze! Put your hands
on your head!

34:06.645 --> 34:08.647
*

34:30.669 --> 34:33.805
That's an immaculate reception.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.341
It worked!

34:35.374 --> 34:37.309
Oh, not quite. There's only
seven minutes left.

34:37.343 --> 34:39.311
There's no way we're gonna
make it to the clinic on time.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.313
Remember I said I had a plan?

34:41.347 --> 34:43.349
(siren whoops)

34:43.382 --> 34:45.684
What the hell
you standing around here for?

34:45.717 --> 34:47.853
Your LAPD escort's here.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.256
We're gonna get you kids
your baby.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.425
(siren wailing)

34:53.459 --> 34:55.227
All right, Happy, we're
making haste with the paste.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.094
HAPPY:
Okay, please don't call it that.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.330
You know what?
If you get here in time,

34:58.364 --> 35:00.599
you can call it whatever
you want. Six minutes left.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.234
We only need four.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.702
Good. Haul your asses.

35:03.735 --> 35:06.672
Hey, my man's baby broth
will be here any minute.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.907
Tell your technician to get
the wash procedure ready.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.410
Um, pardon me.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.379
I've got to fill out
all these forms.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.615
Any way you can hold him
for just a few minutes?

35:16.648 --> 35:19.585
Um, I'm actually coming down
with something, so I can't.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.752
But she can.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.189
WOMAN:
Oh, great. Thanks.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.224
Back in a jiff.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.298
(quietly):
You're not sick.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.300
Yeah. Tickle in my throat.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.235
(baby fussing)

35:36.268 --> 35:38.404
Okay. What?

35:42.441 --> 35:44.410
Look at you, a natural.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.412
Cork it.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.380
(elevator bell dings)

35:49.515 --> 35:51.483
They just gave us one?

35:51.517 --> 35:52.818
TECHNICIAN:
Mr. Curtis.

35:52.851 --> 35:53.919
We have 30 seconds left to start

35:53.952 --> 35:56.255
the cleaning
and preparation process.
Here you go.

35:56.288 --> 35:57.456
Thank you.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.541
Everything looks good.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.709
Ms. Quinn, the doctor's
ready for you.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.711
Just a little paperwork
to sign first.

36:19.745 --> 36:20.646
Okay.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.416
PAIGE:
Okay, guys.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.951
Good luck. See you
back at the garage.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.786
CABE:
Good luck, guys.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.730
Hey.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.433
You okay?

36:41.467 --> 36:43.835
You look nervous.
Don't be.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.239
You took the vitamins, you know,
you read the fertility books,

36:47.273 --> 36:48.440
you wore your
loose boxers.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.642
I've actually gone alfresco
past few weeks.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.912
See? You've done all you can do.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.415
This will all work out.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.318
(exhales slowly)

36:59.351 --> 37:01.620
I'm not just nervous
about becoming a father.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.822
I'm on edge about being a dad.
I mean, I don't...

37:03.855 --> 37:06.458
I didn't have any role models.
I don't know how I'm gonna do.

37:06.492 --> 37:08.260
But, you know,
I've-I've seen you

37:08.294 --> 37:10.829
fill the void
in Ralph's life, and...

37:10.862 --> 37:12.664
actually,
you've done it admirably.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.267
It gives me
a little confidence that

37:15.301 --> 37:18.504
I might be able
to pull this off.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.405
(sighs)

37:19.438 --> 37:22.841
If a putz like you
can be a good dad...

37:26.044 --> 37:28.347
I appreciate it, pal.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.384
Oh, hey, you should have
intercourse with Toby

37:32.418 --> 37:34.553
after the procedure,
just to increase the odds.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.057
Okay.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.426
Bye.

37:57.042 --> 38:01.012
I'm sorry that we fried
your satellite antenna.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.914
You had no choice.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.283
Nope.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.488
Okay, good night, Ralph.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.458
Uh, aren't you going
to Kovelsky's with Sylvester?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.693
Yes. I'm just going
to grab my bag.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.029
I'm just gonna get some takeout,
go home, eat, hit the hay.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.666
I'm sure Sylvester will want to
get back to his apartment, too.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.834
It's been a long day.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.670
(sighs)

38:24.703 --> 38:27.873
(door opens, closes)

38:27.906 --> 38:30.776
I think the bow tie
says "fun and flirty."

38:30.809 --> 38:32.478
I'm ready for my date.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.680
Sorry, pal, but
it's not a date.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.748
She thinks you're just
a couple of friends

38:36.782 --> 38:38.584
picking up takeout
from a diner.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.553
She wants to go home
and get some sleep.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.922
How can she not think
it's a date?

38:43.955 --> 38:46.458
I mean, I asked her
to go with me.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.427
How did you ask her?

38:48.460 --> 38:49.961
I said, "Hey, Florence,

38:49.995 --> 38:52.698
how 'bout grabbing a bite
at Kovelsky's with me?"

38:54.633 --> 38:56.935
See, that's not gonna work.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.637
It's all about linguistics.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.440
You need to say,
"Florence,

39:01.473 --> 39:03.775
do you want to go on a date
with me to Kovelsky's?"

39:03.809 --> 39:06.778
Or, ideally,
someplace whose menus

39:06.812 --> 39:08.780
don't come with word scrambles.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.749
That's much harder to say.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.117
You can work up to it.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.787
Okay.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.390
Well, I guess
I got to go get her.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.825
Um, how do I look?

39:19.858 --> 39:23.562
Like 69.23 Bitcoin.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.831
Thanks, Ralph.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.001
PAIGE:
Ralph, honey, come in here.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.406
Hey, so since,
uh, you and Walter

39:34.440 --> 39:36.642
can't work on your satellite
tonight, he's gonna catch up

39:36.675 --> 39:38.777
on some billing
and we're gonna watch a movie.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.746
Sure.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.423
(sighs)

39:54.660 --> 39:57.829
Tell you what, Ralph.
After dinner,

39:57.863 --> 40:00.432
how about you and I
repair the antenna?

40:00.466 --> 40:02.100
RALPH:
But it's totally fried.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.969
That'll just make it
more fun and challenging.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.672
Yeah, the weather's nice.
I can set up some work lights.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.907
The sooner we get it
up and running,

40:08.940 --> 40:10.909
the sooner we can
contact Cassie.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.779
Definitely! I mean,
if it's okay with you, Mom.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.481
Definitely okay.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.783
But first, dinner.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.085
Because my guys can't work
on an empty stomach.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.859
Okay.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.528
May I?
Yup.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.102
I really hope
it works out for Toby.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.943
He should know how great
it all turns out to be.
