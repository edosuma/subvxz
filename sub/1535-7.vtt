WEBVTT

00:02.254 --> 00:04.704
So, what are you
working on these days?

00:04.705 --> 00:06.639
I'm studying
one-celled organisms

00:06.641 --> 00:08.007
to try and find
the neurochemicals

00:08.009 --> 00:09.476
that lead to the feeling
of shame.

00:09.478 --> 00:12.879
What would a one-celled organism
have to be embarrassed about?

00:12.881 --> 00:16.383
Same as all of us, getting out
of a car without underwear.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.135
Speaking of underwear,

00:19.137 --> 00:20.937
I have some interesting news...

00:20.939 --> 00:22.939
Okay, if it's
sometimes Howie wears yours,

00:22.941 --> 00:24.274
Leonard already told us.

00:26.111 --> 00:28.495
He was being funny.

00:28.497 --> 00:30.230
I'm pretty sure.

00:31.583 --> 00:34.818
Anyway, I was asked to be
a part of a magazine article

00:34.820 --> 00:38.054
about the 50 sexiest female
scientists in California.

00:38.056 --> 00:39.189
Isn't that cool?

00:39.191 --> 00:40.724
I think it's awful.

00:40.726 --> 00:42.058
Why would you say that?

00:42.060 --> 00:44.894
Bernadette is a
successful microbiologist.

00:44.896 --> 00:47.697
She should be celebrated for
her achievements, not her looks.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.599
I mean, what kind of message
does that send?

00:49.601 --> 00:53.336
I think the message is-- "check
out the rack on that scientist."

00:55.173 --> 00:58.725
Why can't someone be thought
of as both smart and pretty?

00:58.727 --> 01:01.127
I just don't think
a professional woman should have

01:01.129 --> 01:04.030
to flaunt her sexuality
in order to get ahead.

01:04.032 --> 01:05.147
Okay, what's the big deal?

01:05.150 --> 01:06.783
Look, if it helps me make
a sale with a physician,

01:06.785 --> 01:08.067
I don't think it hurts
to flirt a little.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.954
I mean, laugh at their joke,
touch their arm,

01:10.956 --> 01:14.073
maybe crank up the AC
in the car beforehand, you know,

01:14.075 --> 01:16.276
to wake up the girls.

01:17.379 --> 01:19.712
Maybe it's different
in the world of sales,

01:19.714 --> 01:20.947
but it's already hard enough

01:20.949 --> 01:23.049
for women to be taken seriously
in science.

01:23.051 --> 01:25.518
I was kind of excited
about the article,

01:25.520 --> 01:27.253
but now you're making me
feel bad.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.006
No, I think you should do
whatever you want.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.424
You know, maybe
if fashion magazines had

01:31.426 --> 01:32.592
female scientists
in them,

01:32.594 --> 01:34.561
I would've become
a theoretical physicist.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.014
Stop smirking
at each other.

(door rattles)

02:11.263 --> 02:13.147
(knocking on the door)

02:16.902 --> 02:18.602
Thank you.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.654
No, thank you.

02:20.656 --> 02:23.524
Delivery men are
the unsung foot soldiers

02:23.526 --> 02:24.792
of our nation's commerce.

02:24.794 --> 02:27.661
It's because
of people like you,

02:27.663 --> 02:31.332
people like me can limit
our human contact.

02:31.334 --> 02:34.251
I'd shake your hand,
but, well, you know.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.622
I'm not a delivery man,
I-I'm a doctor.

02:38.624 --> 02:40.374
Although I do
often deliver

02:40.376 --> 02:43.677
alarming biopsy results
to my patients.

02:45.631 --> 02:48.515
That's humorous.

02:48.517 --> 02:50.684
All right.

02:51.971 --> 02:55.639
Yeah, I-I bet you leave
your patients in stitches.

02:58.194 --> 03:01.562
That was
also humorous.

03:01.564 --> 03:03.447
All right.

03:05.284 --> 03:07.401
Are you bringing
flowers to a patient

03:07.403 --> 03:10.320
to cushion the blow of
a terminal diagnosis?

03:10.322 --> 03:12.489
(laughs)

03:16.045 --> 03:18.662
That wasn't a joke.

03:18.664 --> 03:21.632
All right.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.500
These are actually
for a nice woman

03:23.502 --> 03:25.669
who makes sales
calls to my office.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.638
Hmm.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.839
You know, they have
delivery people

03:28.841 --> 03:31.008
that will do that
for you.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.927
I was hoping
to impress her

03:33.929 --> 03:35.429
by tracking her down
on the Internet

03:35.431 --> 03:38.182
and then showing up
unannounced at her door.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.102
Making the extra effort.

03:42.104 --> 03:44.071
Good for you.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.531
Great timing,
food just got here.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.200
Ooh, Siam Palace?
Yes.

03:56.202 --> 03:58.368
Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?
Yes.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.370
Uh, extra peanut sauce?
No, but you can have mine.

04:00.372 --> 04:01.839
Eh, well, very well.

04:02.958 --> 04:07.127
Oh, and on the topic of
sharing things that are yours,

04:07.129 --> 04:08.629
there is a
gentleman caller

04:08.631 --> 04:11.215
bringing flowers
to your fiancée as we speak.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.884
What?

04:13.886 --> 04:16.720
Why didn't you say that first?

04:16.721 --> 04:19.356
Why didn't you get
extra peanut sauce?

04:19.358 --> 04:21.558
We can both play this game.

04:22.561 --> 04:23.894
Can I help you?

04:23.896 --> 04:25.062
Oh, hi.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.697
Uh, does Penny live here?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.799
May I ask why?

04:28.801 --> 04:31.118
Well, uh...

04:31.120 --> 04:33.570
I-I met her at my office,
she winked at me.

04:33.572 --> 04:34.738
And, uh...

04:36.659 --> 04:41.128
I-I came hoping to initiate
a romantic relationship.

04:41.964 --> 04:44.581
Okay, um...

04:44.583 --> 04:46.917
Look, I'm pretty sure
she didn't wink at you.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.869
Oh, she did.

04:49.672 --> 04:51.839
Seductively, like this.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.428
And then she touched my arm
for two Mississippis.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.097
Like, you know,
one Mississippi, two...

05:00.099 --> 05:02.933
I got it, I got it.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.068
Listen, um...

05:05.070 --> 05:07.688
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.656
See, Penny is my fiancée.

05:09.658 --> 05:11.942
Really?

05:13.112 --> 05:15.913
I've never seen her wear
an engagement ring.

05:17.049 --> 05:18.665
WOLOWITZ AND KOOTHRAPPALI:
Really?

05:22.671 --> 05:24.621
So, am I to presume

05:24.623 --> 05:27.691
that her flirtation was
just a sales technique?

05:27.693 --> 05:29.510
I think so.

05:29.512 --> 05:32.462
When will I learn?

05:32.464 --> 05:36.600
It's just like the cute girl
at the pet store all over again.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.385
Excuse me?

05:38.387 --> 05:42.556
Oh, uh, she touched my arm
for five Mississippis,

05:42.558 --> 05:45.609
and I bought
a $2,000 iguana habitat.

05:47.646 --> 05:51.698
Which she was always too busy
to come over and see.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.485
You give these to Penny.

05:55.487 --> 05:57.654
You're, you're a lucky man.

05:59.124 --> 06:00.490
Thank you.

06:00.492 --> 06:01.492
Sorry.

06:01.493 --> 06:03.210
Oh, uh...

06:03.212 --> 06:05.245
You probably don't want her
to see this.

06:05.247 --> 06:07.381
It's unnecessarily graphic.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.335
Hold on, Doctor.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.537
Leonard, where are
your social skills?

06:14.840 --> 06:16.340
This man is
clearly upset.

06:16.342 --> 06:19.726
We should invite him
in for a hot beverage.

06:21.513 --> 06:23.513
He tried to score with Penny.

06:23.515 --> 06:27.851
So have these two, and they're
having dinner with us.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.691
So, how was
work today?

06:34.693 --> 06:36.827
It was fine,
but you'll be happy to know

06:36.829 --> 06:38.745
they pulled
the sexy scientists article.

06:38.747 --> 06:40.247
What happened?

06:40.249 --> 06:41.331
I don't know.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.367
They just canceled
the photo shoot

06:43.369 --> 06:44.368
and said they're rethinking it.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.753
Well, I'm
really sorry,

06:46.755 --> 06:48.872
but I think it's
for the best.

06:48.874 --> 06:51.258
You want people focusing
on your achievements,

06:51.260 --> 06:53.710
not staring at your
breasts in some magazine.

06:53.712 --> 06:54.878
I guess.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.430
It's really not that important.

06:57.549 --> 06:59.549
Hey, up here.

07:01.303 --> 07:03.887
Sorry, we're...
we were talking about them.

07:05.808 --> 07:09.226
So, look, I-I wasn't going
to say anything,

07:09.228 --> 07:11.745
but since you seem to be okay
with the article being canceled,

07:11.747 --> 07:13.113
I have a little confession.

07:13.816 --> 07:15.349
I'm the reason it was pulled.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.234
What? How?

07:17.236 --> 07:19.403
I sent the editors
of the magazine

07:19.405 --> 07:21.088
a pretty scathing e-mail.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.739
Amy, what did you say?

07:22.741 --> 07:24.574
I simply pointed out

07:24.576 --> 07:26.376
that they would never consider
doing an article

07:26.378 --> 07:28.629
ranking male scientists
on their sexuality,

07:28.631 --> 07:31.565
let alone showing them
in various stages of undress.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.667
Because no one wants to see
Neil deGrasse Tyson

07:33.669 --> 07:37.371
in a wet T-shirt,
bent over the hood of a Porsche.

07:39.224 --> 07:40.457
Well, it doesn't
make a difference,

07:40.459 --> 07:42.926
because they agreed it was
in bad taste,

07:42.928 --> 07:45.479
and now you agree, so...

07:45.481 --> 07:47.681
Amy saves the day.

07:47.683 --> 07:50.567
No, what happened was
you got jealous,

07:50.569 --> 07:53.103
so you took away a chance
for me to get some publicity.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.072
But it was bad publicity.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.107
That's for me to decide,
not you.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.992
I disagree.

07:58.994 --> 08:02.779
As a female scientist, I think
what you do affects all of us.

08:02.781 --> 08:04.247
And I think
you don't like people

08:04.249 --> 08:05.282
expressing their sexuality

08:05.284 --> 08:07.167
because no one wants you
to express yours.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.004
Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.

08:11.006 --> 08:12.456
That was over the line.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.758
You have a nice night.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.043
Please don't go.

08:16.045 --> 08:19.179
Up until my vicious attack,
you were the one in the wrong.

08:22.634 --> 08:24.351
Here you go, Doctor.

08:24.353 --> 08:27.187
Red Zinger
with one teaspoon of honey.

08:27.189 --> 08:28.138
Thank you.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.357
Neat <i> Star Trek</i> mug.

08:30.359 --> 08:31.975
I actually have
one of the phasers

08:31.977 --> 08:33.126
from the original TV show.

08:33.128 --> 08:34.660
Oh, cool.

08:34.663 --> 08:35.861
How'd you get that?

08:35.864 --> 08:39.448
Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry
needed a vasectomy.

08:40.818 --> 08:42.235
Wait a minute.

08:42.236 --> 08:45.105
You've snipped
Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.873
Yes.

08:46.875 --> 08:50.460
Wow, he really went
where no man has gone before.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.083
I don't like to brag,
but, uh, you see,

08:56.085 --> 09:01.221
I'm kind of the doctor
to the stars' urinary tracts.

09:01.223 --> 09:04.674
ALL:
Wow.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.562
Uh, you, you want to see
James Cameron's kidney stone?

09:12.935 --> 09:14.851
ALL:
Ooh.

09:14.853 --> 09:18.989
He was so happy after he passed
it, he gave me a Terminator.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.691
That is amazing.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.193
How long have
you been collecting?

09:23.195 --> 09:24.911
Ever since I was a kid,

09:24.913 --> 09:26.747
but, uh, I didn't really
get serious

09:26.749 --> 09:28.749
until William Shatner's
bladder infection.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.252
What'd you get?
What'd you get?

09:32.254 --> 09:35.038
Well, he said it was a tribble.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.206
It could be a toupee,

09:36.208 --> 09:38.375
but either way,
it's pretty cool.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.962
I-I would love to
see your collection.

09:41.964 --> 09:43.597
Anytime.

09:43.599 --> 09:44.881
Uh, I've got some cool stuff.

09:44.883 --> 09:46.349
When I first started,

09:46.351 --> 09:48.385
I thought it would be
a good way to meet women,

09:48.387 --> 09:51.304
but, well, you know...

09:51.306 --> 09:53.990
Sure. Preach.
SHELDON: We know.

09:53.992 --> 09:57.227
Can I ask you
a personal question?

09:57.229 --> 09:59.479
Sure.

09:59.481 --> 10:03.283
Um, I mean,
you're a guy like me,

10:03.285 --> 10:05.902
so how'd you get
a girl like Penny?

10:05.904 --> 10:07.521
Oh.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.123
Well, you know, just...
(sniffs)

10:10.125 --> 10:12.742
being myself, really.

10:12.744 --> 10:13.877
Oh, please!

10:13.879 --> 10:15.328
You know, I'll tell you
how he did it.

10:15.330 --> 10:18.298
Implacable,
relentless badgering.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.251
In urology terms,

10:21.253 --> 10:23.970
he was a drug-resistant
staph infection.

10:23.972 --> 10:28.091
And she was a urethra
that could not shake him.

10:29.745 --> 10:33.547
I don't know that I'd call
myself an infection.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.649
A gallant man would
defend his fiancée

10:35.651 --> 10:37.517
for being called a urethra.

10:37.519 --> 10:41.138
Can we please
change the subject?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.222
Hi.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.441
Well, that didn't
go your way.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.279
Dr. Lorvis,
what are you doing here?

10:49.281 --> 10:52.232
Uh, well, actually
I came to see you.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.667
Really? Why?

10:53.669 --> 10:56.870
Ah, that's a good question.

10:56.872 --> 10:59.706
Apparently someone was
being awfully flirty

10:59.708 --> 11:01.291
while not wearing
their engagement ring,

11:01.293 --> 11:02.792
causing another
someone to show up

11:02.794 --> 11:04.928
here thinking the first
someone might be available.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.963
Oh, God. Don't make it
so hard on her.

11:06.965 --> 11:09.749
Look, the first someone
is the deceitful you.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.434
The second someone

11:11.436 --> 11:14.804
is the delightful
Dr. Lorvis.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.356
Oh, this is very embarrassing.

11:16.358 --> 11:18.358
Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.360
I did not mean to lead you on.

11:20.362 --> 11:23.813
You touched my arm
for two Mississippis.

11:23.815 --> 11:25.065
Oh.

11:25.067 --> 11:28.652
That's why you were
mumbling "Mississippi."

11:28.654 --> 11:30.320
Can we talk in private?

11:30.322 --> 11:31.137
Please, yes.

11:31.139 --> 11:33.323
I'll be right back.

11:34.376 --> 11:35.909
So what other

11:35.911 --> 11:38.962
celebrity genitalia
have you handled?

11:40.048 --> 11:41.665
So, uh, what's the deal?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.750
You take off your ring
when you go to work?

11:43.752 --> 11:45.252
What? No! No!

11:45.254 --> 11:47.053
I just put it
on the other hand and...

11:47.055 --> 11:49.506
turn it around.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.008
Keep that hand in my pocket.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.393
Why?

11:53.395 --> 11:54.477
Well, what do you mean why?

11:54.479 --> 11:55.479
Look, I make more sales

11:55.480 --> 11:56.813
if these doctors
think I'm single.

11:56.815 --> 11:58.398
I did the same kind of
thing as a waitress.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.318
The real question is, what is
he doing in your apartment?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.485
Oh, he was upset.

12:02.487 --> 12:06.172
So Sheldon invited him
in for a hot beverage.

12:06.174 --> 12:07.440
You were okay with that?

12:07.442 --> 12:08.358
No. I got upset!

12:08.360 --> 12:11.528
And Sheldon made me
a beverage, too.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.697
Okay, he just
showed up at my door.

12:13.699 --> 12:14.998
Don't you think
that's a little weird?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.584
A little, but... he's
basically harmless.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.586
He's actually kind of a nice guy.
Okay.

12:19.588 --> 12:21.338
Whatever, look,
my company does not allow me

12:21.340 --> 12:22.789
to socialize with doctors
outside of work.

12:22.791 --> 12:23.957
You got to get rid of him.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.593
Why am I the one that
has to get rid of him?

12:26.595 --> 12:28.628
I can't do it!
He's my best client!

12:28.630 --> 12:30.964
All right, I'll
get rid of him.

12:30.966 --> 12:32.799
But you owe me one.

12:32.801 --> 12:35.101
Hey, we're going to Oliver's
house to see his collection.

12:35.103 --> 12:36.103
You want to go with us?

12:36.104 --> 12:38.188
Yeah, sure.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.857
You owe me.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.074

12:50.464 --> 12:52.647
(buzzing, beeping and whirring)

12:54.985 --> 12:57.385
Oh, my God!

12:58.773 --> 13:01.007
Leonard, I was wrong.

13:01.009 --> 13:03.509
Heaven does exist.

13:03.511 --> 13:05.778
And it's in the basement
of a urologist's house

13:05.780 --> 13:07.380
in Sherman Oaks.

13:09.217 --> 13:12.368
Welcome to
my Fortress of Solitude.

13:12.370 --> 13:15.204
This is where I go
to get away from...

13:15.206 --> 13:18.074
all my other solitude.

13:19.627 --> 13:21.410
Oh, come on.
It's a replica.

13:21.412 --> 13:22.995
Original.

13:22.997 --> 13:27.150
Oh, I think I just
cheated on my wife.

13:28.736 --> 13:30.903
The gun from <i> Hellboy?</i>

13:30.905 --> 13:32.088
Yup.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.306
How did you get it?

13:33.308 --> 13:34.407
Bought it at auction.

13:34.409 --> 13:36.726
Oh, I was hoping
for a juicy tidbit

13:36.728 --> 13:39.595
about Ron Perlman's testicles.

13:39.597 --> 13:43.382
WOMAN:
Oliver! I'm going to play bingo!

13:43.384 --> 13:45.268
Okay, Mother. Have fun.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.519
Still lives with his mom.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.355
Yikes, right?
(laughs)

13:49.357 --> 13:53.176
Yeah, I'm not quite
sure how to respond.

13:54.512 --> 13:56.612
Wow,<i> Donkey Kong!</i>

13:56.614 --> 13:58.915
This-this was my game
when I was a kid!

13:58.917 --> 13:59.882
Because it's a story

13:59.884 --> 14:01.500
of a pretty blonde girl

14:01.502 --> 14:04.921
tirelessly pursued
by a small, oddly-shaped man?

14:06.191 --> 14:09.926
No, because I liked it.

14:09.928 --> 14:11.794
Well, now, don't get defensive.

14:11.796 --> 14:14.497
You're oddly-shaped,
but you got the girl.

14:15.967 --> 14:19.302
So, I've noticed Leonard
gets teased a lot

14:19.304 --> 14:20.887
about his relationship
with Penny.

14:20.889 --> 14:23.272
Yes. If you'd like to join in,

14:23.274 --> 14:26.642
the premise is their love seems
unlikely and doomed to failure.

14:28.196 --> 14:30.830
So, you think
she'll be single soon?

14:30.832 --> 14:33.065
Oh, if you want
to get in on the pool,

14:33.067 --> 14:34.317
you're too late...

14:34.319 --> 14:36.319
All the squares
have been purchased.

14:37.689 --> 14:38.988
Interesting.

14:38.990 --> 14:41.207
Excuse me, I have to
take care of something.

14:51.552 --> 14:53.135
Leonard, as your friend I feel

14:53.137 --> 14:55.688
I should tell you something.
What?

14:55.690 --> 14:58.257
I'm still upset
about that peanut sauce.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.179
Oh, could you
hold the door?

15:03.181 --> 15:05.431
Nice flowers.
Thank you.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.933
They're for a girl.

15:06.935 --> 15:10.937
Uh, I'm being implacable
and relentless.

15:10.939 --> 15:14.540
Isn't she lucky?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.659
She keeps sending me
mixed signals.

15:16.661 --> 15:19.078
But I-I think we both
want the same thing.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.329
What's that?

15:20.331 --> 15:23.165
Unconditional love.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.867
I guess that's
all anybody wants.

15:24.869 --> 15:26.452
I guess so.

15:26.454 --> 15:29.538
Well, I hope you get it.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.208
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

15:39.801 --> 15:41.751
Next game,
let's switch helmets.

15:41.753 --> 15:44.920
No, I'd look silly
in that helmet.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.394
I-I can't take these.

15:51.396 --> 15:53.396
Well, why not?

15:53.398 --> 15:54.814
I mean, you want what I want.

15:54.816 --> 15:57.900
And we had
two wonderful Mississippis.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.904
But what about
the other girl?

16:01.906 --> 16:03.656
Oh, right.
(stammers)

16:03.658 --> 16:04.824
I'll tell her

16:04.826 --> 16:07.043
we should just be friends.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.000
Dr. Lorvis?

16:14.002 --> 16:16.469
Penny, we should
just be friends.

16:17.305 --> 16:20.306
Happy?

16:29.734 --> 16:31.767
You think he bites?

16:31.769 --> 16:35.571
Stick your hand in there
and find out.

16:35.573 --> 16:37.940
You fooled me with that
goat at the petting zoo.

16:37.942 --> 16:41.444
You will not fool me again.

16:41.446 --> 16:43.446
I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is.

16:43.448 --> 16:44.613
He's been gone a while.

16:44.615 --> 16:48.200
Maybe he's playing
bingo with his mommy.

16:48.202 --> 16:50.252
It's sad how some guys

16:50.254 --> 16:53.089
can't cut the apron strings.

16:53.091 --> 16:55.991
Okay, now you're
messing with me.

16:57.128 --> 17:00.129
Uh, guys, we're locked in here.

17:01.299 --> 17:03.999
Oh, this day just
keeps getting better!

17:07.204 --> 17:10.673
So, you just left them alone
playing games in your house?

17:10.675 --> 17:12.625
Well, they seemed happy and...

17:12.627 --> 17:14.593
I thought
that would give me time

17:14.595 --> 17:17.713
for you and I to get
to know each other better.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.252
That was before we met.

17:24.321 --> 17:27.156
We all have a past.

17:27.157 --> 17:28.908
Doc, you've got to see what
you're doing

17:28.910 --> 17:30.593
is-is a little creepy.

17:30.595 --> 17:32.044
You sound just
like Sigourney Weaver

17:32.046 --> 17:34.814
when I followed her
into a restroom.

17:36.651 --> 17:38.000
Okay, you can't
just go chasing after

17:38.002 --> 17:39.718
every girl who's nice to you.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.454
Well, that's not
what Sheldon says.

17:41.456 --> 17:44.757
And he seems to know
his way around the ladies.

17:45.843 --> 17:48.411
(cell phone ringing)

17:48.413 --> 17:51.347
Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back!
Dr. Lorvis!

17:51.349 --> 17:53.599
Yeah. You care to join us?

17:53.601 --> 17:54.934
What?!

17:54.936 --> 17:56.602
You locked them
in your basement?!

17:58.005 --> 17:59.688
Well, they're,
they're not locked in.

17:59.690 --> 18:01.273
The door just sticks.

18:01.275 --> 18:03.492
Okay, so how do they unstick it?

18:03.494 --> 18:06.462
They'd need the key.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.282
PENNY:
Okay.

18:10.284 --> 18:11.200
Nope. That's it.

18:11.202 --> 18:13.035
We are gonna go
over there right now.

18:13.037 --> 18:15.204
And you are going
to let them out.

18:15.206 --> 18:16.755
Three Mississippi,
four Mississippi...

18:16.757 --> 18:19.792
Move it!

18:22.763 --> 18:24.513
Oh, good, you're here.

18:24.515 --> 18:26.298
Amy, I am so sorry.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.050
That has to wait.
This weirdo locked

18:28.052 --> 18:30.052
the guys up in his basement.
What?!

18:30.054 --> 18:31.971
She seems nice. Who's she?
Just walk.

18:43.116 --> 18:45.166
SHELDON:
You can do this.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.501
One ladder left!

18:47.503 --> 18:49.419
Oh-ho! Yeah!
Yes!

18:49.422 --> 18:50.588
Next level!

18:50.589 --> 18:52.706
Leonard, are you okay?
Better than okay.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.125
I am having the game of my life!

18:56.962 --> 18:58.795
Dr. Lorvis, isn't there
something you want to say?

18:58.797 --> 18:59.963
Yes.

18:59.965 --> 19:02.215
I'm very sorry
for locking you in my home.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.333
Yeah, that was very uncool.

19:03.335 --> 19:04.351
Get the hammer!
Get the hammer!

19:04.353 --> 19:05.385
Got it.

19:05.387 --> 19:08.605
(guys cheering)

19:08.607 --> 19:10.023
Okay, Leonard, let's go!

19:10.025 --> 19:12.325
J-Just hang on!

19:12.327 --> 19:13.760
Well, while we wait,

19:13.762 --> 19:17.264
would you like to see Tobey
Maguire's prostate sonogram?

19:17.266 --> 19:19.533
Sure.
Yeah.

19:19.535 --> 19:21.034
Oh, spoiler alert.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.586
Uh, he was worried
about nothing.
