-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:
-I can't stand when you stay away.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.601
I have to be careful.
It's time we get you out of here.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.229
-You have an older brother.
-Long lost what?

00:21.312 --> 00:24.524
You might be more shocked to know
I have a daughter. Kirby.

00:24.607 --> 00:27.944
What if someone caught us? I'm not
about to blow our plan.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.280
-So, our mom is--
-Blake's sister.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.698
Up to you what you wanna do with it.

00:32.782 --> 00:36.161
Thomas Carrington's will
left equal shares of Carrington Atlantic

00:36.244 --> 00:37.495
to his grandchildren.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.998
My father is no longer fit
to run this company.

00:40.081 --> 00:43.042
It's your job, as CA's board,
to make a change.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.336
If you want out,
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.588
You don't own me.

Hmm.

02:03.957 --> 02:09.002

is finally about to come to fruition.

about getting married in a barn.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.664
The barn's the rustic, I'm the chic.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.833
Just surrender, Anders.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.507
I've been trying to be patient with him,
given what I learnt.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.221
-Did you know Anders has a daughter?
-You mean Kirby?

03:41.679 --> 03:44.599
-Oh. That was anticlimactic.
-She lived with us.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.062
She was...
I'm not gonna say she was a psychopath,

03:49.145 --> 03:50.396
-but--
-Wait, what?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.733
-She mutilated Fallon's Barbies.
-Cut off their hair?

03:53.816 --> 03:56.861
Their heads,
and then threw them into the fireplace.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.114
The smell of burning plastic
still reminds me of Christmas.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.993
She stole from Dad,
she terrorized my mother.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.496
Anders didn't mention this?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.040
If he had, I wouldn't have invited her.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.627
-Oh, my God. Does Anders know?
-Do I know what?

04:13.920 --> 04:17.089
That you bought 25 antique spittoons
for centerpieces?

04:20.551 --> 04:24.347
Carrington Atlantic isn't just
a family business, it's a company.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.393
It's a growth engine
for the city of Atlanta.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.310

04:31.354 --> 04:34.274
-What are you doing here?
-Brought you something for luck.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.191
What is it?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.694
It's my father's ashes,

04:38.278 --> 04:41.072
to keep and remind you
of what you're here to do.

04:43.032 --> 04:47.203
-I'm just kidding. It's a candle.
-Thank you.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.456
Are you ready to become the new CEO?

04:50.540 --> 04:55.253
There's nothing I've ever wanted more.
Well, almost nothing.

04:56.337 --> 04:59.340
I was thinking, if the board promotes me,
I'm gonna re-hire you.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.344
-How does VP of Community Outreach sound?
-Like it's not for me.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.514
I get it. You wanna play hardball
with the boss. Fine

05:06.597 --> 05:10.768
-President of Community Outreach.
-I never wanted a career at CA.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
This was about doing right by my father.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.315
-[elevator dings]
-[Blake] Is it navy or black?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.026
He's here.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.487
Go get it.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.200
Sorry to keep you waiting.
No one told me there was a meeting.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.828
It was an emergency.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.414
Anyone care to tell me
what this is about?

05:31.497 --> 05:35.710
The members are here to discuss
the future of Carrington Atlantic's CEO.

05:36.919 --> 05:41.174
Or lack thereof. Firing an employee
for being a so-called whistle-blower,

05:41.257 --> 05:46.054
mishandling the Clarke County crisis
and then trying to cover it up.

05:46.387 --> 05:49.724
-But that was your--
-Regardless, time's up, Daddy.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.185
This is absurd.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.936
I'm Chairman of the Board,

05:54.103 --> 05:57.190
and you're listening to a child
who's been COO for a week.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.401
Board will decide what's
in the best interests of the shareholders.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.195
Fallon.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.866
Many family companies are lost
in three generations:

06:07.283 --> 06:10.495
moneymaker, caretaker, undertaker.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.373
As the fourth generation,
I refuse to stand by

06:14.457 --> 06:16.542
and watch my father bury my legacy.

06:17.126 --> 06:21.422
Carrington Atlantic is not just
a family business, it is a dynasty.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.596
Time for your morning meds, Blaisdel.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.308
Ah. You're almost done
with your baby carrier.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.226
Yeah.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.729
Just goes to show you,
you can accomplish anything.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.689
That's what my grandmother told me.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.566
[groaning] Oh, no.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.028
Yeah. Nice try.
Still gonna have to take your meds.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.366
-I think my water broke.
-Oh. Uh...

06:48.449 --> 06:50.368
Okay. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.703
No, the baby isn't supposed to come
this soon.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.747
Hey, hey, I'm here.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.666
Why would I want you here?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.128
A baby's about to rip itself
out of my body!

07:00.211 --> 07:02.421
Get me a real doctor! Go!

07:03.005 --> 07:05.591
-Now! Go!
-Hang tight. I'll be right back.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.509
Help me!

07:12.473 --> 07:13.683
Good timing, doctor.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.186
Let's get my baby out of here.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.981
The board of Carrington Atlantic
has concluded

07:20.064 --> 07:22.108
it's in the best interests of this company

07:22.191 --> 07:25.069
to shift attention
to a more forward-thinking narrative.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.112
You can't be serious.

07:26.195 --> 07:30.283
Blake, you can continue as Chairman
of the Board until a replacement is named.

07:30.950 --> 07:35.246
Fallon, congratulations. You're the first
female CEO in company history.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.874
Thought I heard the sound
of glass breaking.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.545
How could you do this?
After everything I've done for you.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.965
Doing what's best for the family.
Isn't that what you always say?

07:46.549 --> 07:49.051
Your father left controlling interest
to me and Steven

07:49.135 --> 07:52.472
because your days were numbered.
Grandpa always did know best.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.806
Oh, that's debatable.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.227
-What are you doing here?
-Settling your debt.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.648
Still on the juice, Jeff? Hard to tell
when you're not staggering like a toddler.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.277
No. Come on, Fallon,
that's no way to talk to family.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.112
[Jeff] That's right.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.908
We're Carringtons,
and we're here for what's ours.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.138
If Thomas left that trust
for his grandchildren,

08:34.222 --> 08:36.765
then my sister and I
are entitled to shares.

08:36.849 --> 08:41.354
This must be a painful reckoning for you,
Blake, but you had it coming.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.981
Your family's been living the good life
for decades,

08:44.190 --> 08:47.777
while our deadbeat grandpa let my parents
struggle to put food on our table.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.280
-And your father was no better.
-I didn't have a choice.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.990
Your silence was a choice.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.327
Once we're added to the trust,
we can liquidate this company,

08:56.410 --> 08:59.038
get our money,
and bury the Carrington name.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.249
Our lawyers will be in touch.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.754
-Don't blame me.
-Why not?

09:07.755 --> 09:10.716
You lied to me
and you let me sleep with my cousin.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.637
Half cousin. I didn't know
you were together until the engagement.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.514
It was late to say anything.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.519
-You're not pregnant.
-You're winning father of the year.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.981
Really?
You just got me fired from my own company.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.985
The fewer people that knew,
the less likely the Colbys would find out.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.362
I was trying to safeguard
your inheritance. Well, bang up job, Dad.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.117
Jeff and Monica hung a "for sale" sign
on our lawn.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.579
With their shares
they could lead a coup on this company.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.123
It's a good thing you're the CEO then.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.750
You wanted to steal the reins so bad,

09:45.418 --> 09:48.462
I'm looking forward to watching you
get bucked off the horse.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.553
Maybe Kirby will be a no show
and we can pretend this never happened.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.431
If she shows, it might be
an emotional ambush for Anders.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.059
She used to catch lizards
and put them under Fallon's pillow.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.477
That's kind of cute.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.480
She'd suffocate them
and leave a note that said, "You're next."

10:06.606 --> 10:08.524
You must be talking about Kirby.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.445
No, he was telling me about <i>Carrie.</i>
I've never seen it.

10:12.528 --> 10:16.490
Well, if you like horror movies,
I've got a great one for you.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.660
In which,
the Colbys are actually Carringtons.

10:19.744 --> 10:24.415
Somewhere around the second act, I bang
my cousin, we lose the family company.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.626
-Is that true?
-Oh, my God.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.628
Grandpa knocked up his secretary,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.631
spent his life trying to keep
the Colbys out of our coffers.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.886
-What did Dad have to say?
-Good luck. I got him fired.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.014
But that makes me CEO
of Carrington Atlantic,

10:40.097 --> 10:43.059
which might not last long
if the Colbys try to force a sale.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.061
Holy hell, Fallon.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.272
Go back to where you bang your cousin.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.442
-Let's not.
-Do they think they can force a sale?

10:52.109 --> 10:54.987
Well, if the Colbys join our trust,

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
they'll dilute our shares
and voting power.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.992
Be thankful the Colbys
don't have another sibling,

11:00.076 --> 11:02.244
or our votes would be diluted more.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.122
Well, they don't, but you do.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.085
Oh, my God. I forgot about Hank.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.008
Wait, where are you going?
It's our rehearsal dinner.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.476
Uh... Hate to interrupt
your regression to childhood,

11:25.559 --> 11:29.230
but we're supposed to be having dinner?
Your son is getting married tomorrow?

11:29.313 --> 11:32.024
Celebrate Steven then.
Tonight we're celebrating Hank.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.776
I'll bite. What's the occasion?

11:33.859 --> 11:37.071
I can only assume you're here
to make him CA's newest shareholder.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.117
-I had the paperwork drawn for you.
-What are you trying to prove?

11:41.200 --> 11:44.745
No matter how clever you think you are,
I'm always two steps ahead of you.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.832
-It's called experience.
-Woo-hoo.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.167
You see that? I just pwned that alien.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.760
The look on Blake's face was priceless.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.095
[cell phone buzzes]

12:01.178 --> 12:04.765
Priceless? Actually,
it's a very specific dollar amount.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.519
That Russian oligarch I mentioned
rang me with an offer.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.729
-It was generous.
-[Monica] I used to think

12:10.813 --> 12:12.606
I wanted away
from all this excess,

12:12.690 --> 12:16.068
but then I realized I really like money.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.488
Told him you planned to push
for a quick sale?

12:19.572 --> 12:23.492
-We told him. Well, Fallon, really.
-Fallon was there?

12:23.576 --> 12:27.121
Before we walked in,
the board moved to name her the new CEO.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.331
I didn't realize.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.418
-That changes things completely.
-How so?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.380
I would have never brought you into this
if I thought

12:36.464 --> 12:38.883
it would have hurt Steven or Fallon. Well, like you said, it's our birthright.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.389
So, it's not up to you anymore.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.110
I love the smell of excess in the morning.

12:58.694 --> 13:02.615
-Can't say I'm happy to be back.
-Blake won't be happy about it either.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.993
Upstairs, second door on the left.
I have to use the girl's room.

13:06.076 --> 13:10.122
-Sure you'll be okay?
-I got us this far, didn't I? Just go. Go.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.127
Yeah, that's good. Thank you.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.048
I'm pleased you decided
against the snakeskin cowboy boots.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.217
You decided against them.

13:22.009 --> 13:26.889
I wanted to thank you for talking me down
after my wedding jitters the other day.

13:26.972 --> 13:31.310
After hearing about your past,
your marriage and your daughter...

13:32.311 --> 13:34.730
it sort of put things into perspective.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.192
Not an easy subject to discuss,
but if it helped,

13:38.275 --> 13:40.027
maybe it was worth the discomfort.

13:40.110 --> 13:44.740
Do you ever, I don't know,
think about getting in touch with Kirby?

13:45.324 --> 13:48.827
Well, I tried phoning her
on the day that we spoke about her.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.499
-You did?
-I hung up as soon as I heard her voice.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.545
I sound like a terrible father,
but the truth is,

13:58.045 --> 14:03.133
I spent years in therapy trying to accept
the fact that Kirby is troubled.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.930
But this is supposed to be a celebration,
so let's focus on that.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.854
-Don't you look handsome.
-[chuckles]

14:16.772 --> 14:20.985
What's a $450 rental when you're the heir
to the Carrington fortune?

14:21.443 --> 14:25.698
It happened just like you said it would.
Blake was begging me to sign.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.076
How soon after the sale do I get my cut?

14:29.159 --> 14:32.955
Because there's this sick
adobe hunting ranch near Santa Fe I'm--

14:33.038 --> 14:36.709
We might have to wait a few months.
Possibly a year.

14:36.792 --> 14:41.589
Fallon got named CEO yesterday. We stand
to make a lot more money in the long run.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.466
So, I need you to vote against the sale.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.761
Against it?
The whole plan was to hit it and quit it.

14:48.345 --> 14:52.057
That is your style. This time
we need to not act so prematurely.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.561
I want my money now.
What if that DNA test comes back?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.480
I'll handle it,
just like I handle everything.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.276
As for your money,
I'll double the percentage.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.989
-To 20 percent?
-Yes, two times ten is 20.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.908
Your math skills are improving.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.286
Just imagine
how much adobe hunting ranch that'll buy.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.833
Okay.
So, what I told Blake I'd do wasn't a lie.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.921
-Our original plan is now the opposite.
-Just vote no.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.886
Sir, the press are outside,
here to cover Steven's wedding.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.095
As they should be.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.099
-Not what your wife is discussing.
-[Cristal] <i>I will be stepping</i>

15:34.183 --> 15:37.770
<i>down from the company</i>
<i>to focus on family, as will Blake.</i>

15:38.270 --> 15:41.357
<i>-He wrote this statement.</i>
-What the hell is this?

15:41.440 --> 15:46.195
<i>"As a wedding present to his son,</i>
<i>Blake is going to take up Steven's mantle,</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:49.657
<i>by going to visit the third world</i>
<i>****hole countries."</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:52.576
<i>Whew. Should have read over this first.</i>
<i>So sorry.</i>

15:53.118 --> 15:56.205
<i>"Blake will tour</i>
<i>Steven's disaster response charities</i>

15:56.288 --> 16:00.626
<i>in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Haiti.</i>

16:00.709 --> 16:05.089
Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania,

16:05.589 --> 16:06.423
Uh...

16:06.507 --> 16:08.175
-Mozambique--"
-Thank you, Cristal.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.929
You know,
on a day honoring loyalty and love,

16:12.012 --> 16:15.182
I'd be remiss
not to credit my wife for her support.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.894
I look forward to my world tour,
and I feel blessed

16:19.478 --> 16:22.731
that she will be at my side,
for all of it.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.651
[reporter] How long will the tour last?

16:25.734 --> 16:27.361
[reporters clamoring]

16:27.444 --> 16:31.240
Our legal team is sorting through the
Colbys' claim, as I told all shareholders,

16:31.323 --> 16:32.741
this is no time to sell.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.828
Let me call you back.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.624
-Hey, it's you.
-Yeah, came for the wedding.

16:42.876 --> 16:46.255
I also came to let you know
I can't accept your job offer.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.799
I get it. You don't wanna work for CA.

16:48.882 --> 16:53.512
I get what you're trying to do,
to find some way to keep me in your life.

16:54.179 --> 16:58.017
-You told me to choose you.
-And I meant, choose the right thing.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.478
I'm glad you finally did.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.696
You are going to make a great CEO.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.117
But it's time for me to move on.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.875
After Steven's wedding, I'm leaving
Atlanta, and I just wanted you to know.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.420
What? Like, "leaving" leaving?

17:29.506 --> 17:30.591
But what about us?

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
I love you.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.603
I'm gonna see if I can help set up.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.646
I'll see you.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.494
-What's this about?
-Today's the day.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.164
-It's my son's wedding day.
-Isn't that how you godfathers operate?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.666
[Monica] Sorry, is this
inconvenient for you?

18:04.750 --> 18:07.503
We'd have preferred
it happened 12 years ago.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.296
Or 45, but here we are.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.966
We have a buyer and we want a fair vote.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.478
I forgot how handsome you are.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.564
Good thing you and Blake
are the same size.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.193
That bump's gonna make it hard
to blend in.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.070
Yeah. I've been working on it.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.283
-Where did you get that?
-The gun room. [chuckles]

18:38.367 --> 18:41.245
You think they would have updated
security since I was here.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.663
We talked about this.

18:43.622 --> 18:47.084
We're here to confront Blake
in front of the press. We need witnesses,

18:47.167 --> 18:50.129
or they'll have me arrested
and you re-committed.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.340
-The man tried to kill you.
-I almost lost everything.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.136
You... our child.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.597
But we aren't here to hurt Blake.

19:01.431 --> 19:06.895
You understand? Not at his son's wedding.
Not in front of his wife.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.813
[scoffs]

19:09.356 --> 19:11.275
That's who you're concerned about.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.278
Cristal. None of this would have happened
if it weren't for her.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.697
This has nothing to do with Cristal.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.869
Is that why you wanted to come here?
So you could see her again?

19:23.787 --> 19:24.746
[chuckles]

19:25.164 --> 19:28.458
Oh, my God.
You sprung me from a loony bin,

19:28.542 --> 19:31.253
so I could have your baby
and you could raise it with her.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.337
What?

19:33.046 --> 19:37.176
Of course not. Look, all I'm saying
is she doesn't deserve to be hurt.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.888
-You said how good she was to you.
-I was high on benzos!

19:41.471 --> 19:45.559
[scoffs] I can't believe this.
You're still in love with her.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.061
That's crazy.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.026
That's what you used to call me
when I would accuse you.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.695
-Claudia.
-I wasn't crazy, was I?

19:58.572 --> 20:02.826
The whole point of all of this
is so that we could finally be together.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.244
But...

20:05.996 --> 20:07.998
I guess we can't until she's gone.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.708
[Matthew] Claudia!

20:11.293 --> 20:12.127
Claudia!

20:22.262 --> 20:24.640
The ceremony will start in half an hour.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.643
Family photos take place after
in the trophy room,

20:27.726 --> 20:31.230
while the guests retire
to the main house for the reception.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.733
Now, just make sure
that all of these lamps

20:34.942 --> 20:37.861
are fueled and placed around the property
before nightfall.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.030
Otherwise, it'll be complete chaos.

20:40.614 --> 20:44.243
What are we waiting on?
Go have your lawyers vet the paperwork

20:44.326 --> 20:47.537
-but we have the legal right to vote.
-[Hank] Sorry, I'm late.

20:48.038 --> 20:51.291
-The bow-tie thing was a disaster.
-Who the hell is he?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.542
-I'm Hank.
-He's Hank.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.087
You're not our only long-lost brother.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.047
Cousin.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.925
I-- He's our brother. I mean--

21:00.509 --> 21:04.554
Hank is the fifth member of the
grandkids' trust. We added him last night.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.599
So, even if you got the other shareholders
to vote with you,

21:07.891 --> 21:10.811
we'd still have majority,
making it impossible to force a sale.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.396
But feel free to try.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.732
I think I will.

21:16.191 --> 21:20.696
Hank, this deal would put billions,
with a B, in each of our pockets,

21:21.154 --> 21:22.155
including yours.

21:22.656 --> 21:27.494
Hank, sweetie, our company is worth
much more than what they're offering.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.996
They're lowballing.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.251
I motion that we put
the sale of the company to a vote.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.004
Motion granted. All in favor?

21:40.048 --> 21:44.553
We just met, but I'm gonna bet your
story's a lot closer to ours than theirs.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.264
You didn't grow up in a house like this.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.809
You've never known
what it's like to have real money.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.477
"Never worry again" money.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.773
Those opposed?

22:00.444 --> 22:03.613
Hank? This is where you vote with us.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.744
Carringtons love to boss people around.
But this is your decision, not hers.

22:10.912 --> 22:15.167
I'm sorry. But when you come from nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.627
I vote to sell.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.303
[Steven] How could he do that?

22:27.929 --> 22:30.015
Were all my children born traitors?

22:30.724 --> 22:35.937
Okay, I trust you'll inform the board
of the vote. After the wedding, of course.

22:36.813 --> 22:39.524
For once, it was nice
doing business with you.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.490
Look, before today,

22:46.573 --> 22:50.452
all I inherited were lies
that shaped almost every choice I made.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.038
I'm sorry I took that out on you.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.124
Maybe someday you can forgive me
and we own this city.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.587
-Billionaire cousins joining forces.
-Sounds like a complete disaster.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.840
Or, maybe it's what we were born to do.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.266
I spend my whole life
preserving our family's empire.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.145
You've been CEO for less than 24 hours,
you already lost it.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.898
-It's not over yet.
-It sure as hell isn't.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.235
I'm gonna contest the sale and the trust.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.654
My lawyers will rip them apart.

23:25.737 --> 23:29.157
Well... as much as I'd like
to stay and watch,

23:29.699 --> 23:32.702
I'm about to get married.
Maybe I'll see you there.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.456
When you come from nothing,
you've got nothing to lose?

23:36.623 --> 23:39.126
That's what Jeff used to say
when we had Morell Corp.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.669
You don't think he got to Hank.

23:41.128 --> 23:45.465
Jeff Colby didn't come from nothing.
I did everything I could to help him.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.511
It's a melodramatic phrase.
Your mother used to say it.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.687
Have you seen Mom?

23:58.937 --> 24:03.066
Thankfully, no, but Steven told me
what happened. I'm so sorry, Fallon.

24:03.150 --> 24:07.237
We all underestimated Hank's normalcy.
Of course he voted to cash out.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.323
-We should, too.
-Mom might've swayed Hank's vote.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.660
She convinced him to give her a cut.
I'm gonna go find that bitch.

24:13.743 --> 24:19.040
I will. Wedding's about to start. We can't
have you two ending up in the pool again.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.587
I can't handle any more drama today.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.923
May your marriage be the first
to work out.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.891
From her lips, to God's ears.

24:37.559 --> 24:42.147
-Mrs. Daniels. What are you doing here?
-I came here to see you, of course.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.357
You're looking very sexy, as always.

24:45.483 --> 24:48.195
You realize
I'm about to walk down the aisle?

24:48.278 --> 24:51.448
Yes. That's why I couldn't wait
to come see you.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.034
I couldn't let you do this
without knowing.

24:54.534 --> 24:58.038
-Without knowing what?
-Steven, I'm pregnant.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.753
Now, I don't expect you
to call all this off.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.255
I mean, I don't expect that.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.676
Let's talk after, okay?
You're going to be a father.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.894
After all I've done,
how dare you not do the one thing I asked!

25:20.977 --> 25:23.313
The one thing? The one thing?

25:24.481 --> 25:26.608
I cut off my finger for you!

25:26.691 --> 25:27.817
Half a finger!

25:28.526 --> 25:32.948
You think I'll let you walk away with
millions of my children's inheritance?

25:33.031 --> 25:38.370
It's billions. With a B, and an S.
And you don't have a choice.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.790
You blow my cover,
I'll tell everyone this was your idea.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.458
And who wins then, Hank?

25:45.168 --> 25:47.003
You're the only one that knows.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.631
-Is that a threat?
-Maybe.

25:51.508 --> 25:55.345
My brother is about to get married,
so we're gonna go downstairs,

25:55.762 --> 25:58.014
and when it's over, then we'll talk.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.274
I guess incest runs in the family.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.484
Cristal. We were just--

26:09.567 --> 26:10.485
Get out, Hank!

26:11.695 --> 26:13.738
Your mommy and I need to talk.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.247
[guests chattering and laughing]

26:30.797 --> 26:32.215
I think we should start.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.551
-Should I tell Anders?
-Sure.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.304
No, definitely.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.431
Are you nervous?

26:40.682 --> 26:41.683
Hey.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.854
Let's pretend
no one else is in the room but us.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.774
Just you and me,
for the rest of our lives.

26:49.858 --> 26:54.070
<i>♪ Everything will be all right</i>
<i>You're the only thing ♪</i>

26:54.154 --> 26:56.072
Cristal's leaving me, isn't she?
