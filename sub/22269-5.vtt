00:07.216 --> 00:09.592
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

00:09.593 --> 00:13.138
<i>a boat in a field,</i>

00:13.139 --> 00:15.265
<i>a married couple gone missing,</i>

00:15.266 --> 00:18.643
<i>a gun that shoots air...</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:20.770
<i>And then there's
a hidden house,</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:22.230
<i>a prophecy
from another world...</i>

00:22.231 --> 00:24.817
<i>surely these pieces don't fit.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:30.989
Left unwatered,
a plant will die.

00:30.990 --> 00:36.119
Left unloved,
a good child could go bad.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.495
Left untended,

00:37.496 --> 00:39.789
a dream...

00:39.790 --> 00:43.626
could become a nightmare.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.854
Gripps?

01:04.607 --> 01:05.608
Cross?

01:06.150 --> 01:08.735
You boys still exist?

01:08.736 --> 01:09.611
No.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.239
I stopped existing

01:13.240 --> 01:15.075
a long time ago.

01:15.076 --> 01:15.909
It made my legs sore.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.163
How long we been in here, man?

01:20.164 --> 01:24.250
7,776,000 seconds.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.294
How many days is that?

01:26.295 --> 01:28.338
How many seconds in a day?

01:28.339 --> 01:32.050
Not gonna lie to you, boys.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.927
This sucks.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.597
Martin?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.015
Yeah?

01:39.016 --> 01:41.559
How long can we go
without energy, man?

02:00.371 --> 02:02.956
Keep your eyes open.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.501
Suzie Boreton hasn't been
this hard to get ahold of by accident.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.545
Yeah, okay.

02:09.964 --> 02:13.091
You know, Suzie Boreton's always been
a little bit of an odd duck.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.551
Do you really think
she's part of this?

02:14.552 --> 02:17.470
I mean, do you think she's,
like, um, dangerous?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.140
I just don't know that
she's not dangerous.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.599
Her old boss
is still missing,

02:21.600 --> 02:22.892
plus the four women
from the book club.

02:22.893 --> 02:26.187
We don't have enough
to arrest her, but--

02:26.188 --> 02:27.397
What are you doing?

02:27.398 --> 02:28.815
I almost, uh...

02:28.816 --> 02:29.941
forgot the dang thing.

02:29.942 --> 02:30.817
There...

02:30.818 --> 02:31.985
There it is.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.361
I can't let this go on
any longer,

02:33.362 --> 02:35.363
not...not if we're
questioning a suspect.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.949
What are you doing?

02:38.409 --> 02:40.118
Farah Adrienne Black,

02:40.119 --> 02:42.412
in accordance with
Montana state law

02:42.413 --> 02:47.000
via posse comitatus code
OCGA 17-4-24,

02:47.001 --> 02:48.501
I hereby deputize you
into the service

02:48.502 --> 02:50.546
of the Bergsberg County
Sheriff's Department.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.508
Is this for real?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.010
Yeah.

02:57.011 --> 03:00.513
Any able-bodied person is
subject to deputization by the--

03:00.514 --> 03:03.474
by the local...

03:03.475 --> 03:05.268
Are you... are you okay?

03:05.269 --> 03:07.438
Yeah, I just...

03:09.565 --> 03:11.774
I've wanted
to work in law enforcement

03:11.775 --> 03:13.484
my entire life, and...

03:15.946 --> 03:17.405
there it is.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.032
Yeah, well.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.491
You know, I feel like
you're more of a cop

03:20.492 --> 03:22.660
than I've ever been, and...

03:22.661 --> 03:24.830
you know,
you deserve it--

03:31.962 --> 03:33.630
Thanks, Sherlock.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.965
My pleasure,
Deputy Black.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.550
Okay.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.470
Well, then yesterday, I spent
the majority of the day out,

03:40.471 --> 03:42.556
so I wasn't here
when you came by.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.394
I didn't say
we came by, Suzie.

03:49.104 --> 03:49.938
What's your name again?

03:49.939 --> 03:51.356
Farah Black.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.733
How did you know we were here?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.444
Well, Sarah,
I'm clearly confused.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.947
- "Farah."
- Hmm?

03:59.156 --> 04:01.282
So, where's Bob?

04:01.283 --> 04:04.202
Poor goof has been sick
for a week,

04:04.203 --> 04:06.537
dosed up to his eyebrows
on flu medication.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.539
Plus he bumped
his dang head somehow.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.917
Don't know
how it happened.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.002
You know, there was
some damage

04:13.003 --> 04:15.088
to the outside
of the house, too.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.923
I was actually thinking
of calling you, Sheriff.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.299
Oh yeah?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.261
So you didn't make it
to this week's book club?

04:21.262 --> 04:23.304
Book club? Nope.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.181
I haven't been
for ages.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.766
They actually
stopped inviting me

04:26.767 --> 04:28.601
after the accident.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.396
Just the way people are
these days, I suppose.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.147
Yeah. Yeah,
I suppose they are.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.440
Where's the dog?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.441
What?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.609
The dog.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.655
Bob's dog, Agrajag.
Where is it?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.867
Oh, gosh, you found me out!

04:44.868 --> 04:46.703
I knew you were gonna ask!

04:46.704 --> 04:48.454
Jeez, is everything, uh...

04:48.455 --> 04:50.665
Yeah, I just...

04:50.666 --> 04:51.834
Scott killed him.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.716
Ran him over
with his dang car.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.259
I don't think
it was an accident,

05:01.260 --> 05:04.220
and I don't know
what to do.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.805
You know,
Bob's out of commission,

05:05.806 --> 05:09.142
so I've just been
dealing with this all by myself,

05:09.143 --> 05:11.728
and Scott has been
acting so strange

05:11.729 --> 05:13.104
the past couple days,

05:13.105 --> 05:14.897
talking about
all this weird stuff,

05:14.898 --> 05:16.566
people from another world,

05:16.567 --> 05:19.193
some sort of fairy tale.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.404
I don't know what to do.

05:21.405 --> 05:25.116
I think he's having some kind
of psychiatric breakdown.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.618
We need to talk to Scott.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.078
You do.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.330
Because somebody has to,

05:30.331 --> 05:31.914
because I don't want
to be one of those parents

05:31.915 --> 05:34.667
who's left
wishing they spoke up

05:34.668 --> 05:38.046
when their child goes
and does something terrible.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.547
Where can we
find him?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.341
He's not
answering his phone,

05:41.342 --> 05:43.009
but, um...

05:43.010 --> 05:45.053
I know where he'll be tonight.

05:45.054 --> 05:48.306
Him and his little friends
are going to some music thing,

05:48.307 --> 05:49.682
they wanted to see someone,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.184
Applesauce?
Billy Applesauce?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.143
We could go there,

05:52.144 --> 05:53.436
try to have a word,

05:53.437 --> 05:56.230
but, man, it is big.
It's crowded.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.148
Well,
if Scott's there,

05:57.149 --> 05:59.359
and he's connected,

05:59.360 --> 06:00.819
Dirk will find him.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.907
Why are we
getting breakfast?

06:05.908 --> 06:07.492
Shouldn't we be
investigating something?

06:07.493 --> 06:09.619
I mean, I love breakfast,
big fan, but...

06:09.620 --> 06:10.953
This is how it works.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.955
We go where Dirk takes us.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.791
Okay, back to business.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.459
Did you just change?

06:16.460 --> 06:18.628
No, Todd, it's still me.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.254
Though my clothes are different.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.257
I traded these for the ones
I got in evidence lock-up.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.176
You traded police property?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.011
Check out my jacket!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.097
They were vintage.
Smart, right?

06:29.098 --> 06:31.057
Genius!
Why didn't I think of that?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.183
Because it's
literally a crime.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.559
Listen,
from here on in,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.770
I want to do things
by the book.

06:35.771 --> 06:36.771
What book?

06:36.772 --> 06:38.106
The boring book
of mundane deduction

06:38.107 --> 06:41.567
you and I are coauthoring
about being normal detectives, Todd.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.445
Panto Trost said
he recognized the mural,

06:44.446 --> 06:47.240
but couldn't tell us anything about it
or how he got here.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.866
Wendimoor, if it exists,

06:48.867 --> 06:49.909
is still,
for the most part,

06:49.910 --> 06:50.993
out of our reach,

06:50.994 --> 06:52.829
and so we start
with the facts,

06:52.830 --> 06:55.748
and the facts are
the Cardenas family.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.668
Tina, take out the file.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.630
I want to look at evidence
and draw conclusions,

07:02.631 --> 07:04.757
not rely on insane coincidences

07:04.758 --> 07:08.719
to shuffle me from
catastrophe to catastrophe.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.012
I'm doing something different.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.098
I'm breaking the mold.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.641
At this point
in most of my cases,

07:13.642 --> 07:16.436
there's this tremendous amount
of weird things

07:16.437 --> 07:17.645
all swirling around,

07:17.646 --> 07:19.564
and then, well...

07:19.565 --> 07:20.940
people start dying.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.443
Lots of lovely people,
very dead,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.820
as I continue to blunder
aimlessly about saying,

07:25.821 --> 07:28.197
as Todd would have it,
"stupid flighty bullshit."

07:28.198 --> 07:29.407
I would say that.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.408
I do say things like that.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.451
Yes, but
not this time.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.703
Okay, I'm liking
this attitude.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.704
You inspired it.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.956
We've got to get
ahead of the game.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.666
We can't just keep
expecting somebody

07:38.667 --> 07:40.126
to just walk up and say--

07:40.127 --> 07:41.544
Excuse me.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.004
Yes?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.046
I'm sorry.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.048
Where did you get
those pictures?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.550
Um, this is
police business--

07:47.551 --> 07:48.759
We were there.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.262
We went in this house.
we found those bodies.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.931
I knew this day would come.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.392
These are my parents.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.314
This house is where I was born.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.691
You're telling me
you went in there?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.985
The fences came down?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.195
Yes, but--

08:07.196 --> 08:10.532
I've been avoiding this moment
for 50 years.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.245
It's destiny
you came here today.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.040
Shit.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.461
Where are you from, Bart?

08:23.462 --> 08:24.837
What was life like
for you before?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.132
I, uh...

08:28.133 --> 08:30.843
I used to be a lot shorter.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.846
When you were a child?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.516
Oh...

08:38.727 --> 08:40.770
Hey, why are you
in such a good mood now?

08:40.771 --> 08:43.898
Before, you were all
doomy-gloomy "gimme a sandwich."

08:43.899 --> 08:45.149
What changed?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.400
I'm trying
to keep perspective

08:46.401 --> 08:47.985
on my circumstances.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.238
It's a matter of time, you see.

08:50.239 --> 08:54.200
The Forest Witch said
I'd find Dirk Gently, and I've found him.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.785
He's discovered an image of my world,

08:55.786 --> 08:57.662
so perhaps the rest
will fall into place soon,

08:57.663 --> 08:59.080
perhaps not.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.039
You're not scared?

09:00.040 --> 09:00.957
Scared?

09:00.958 --> 09:02.708
Of course not.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.877
I'm fearless.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.296
My sister always says
it's my worst quality.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.299
You're... not even
scared of me?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.801
Where I'm from,

09:11.802 --> 09:13.970
I've seen
monsters from the forest,

09:13.971 --> 09:16.473
evil knights,
a deranged wizard...

09:17.683 --> 09:20.602
why would I be scared
of a beautiful woman?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.818
Farson, how far are we?

09:28.819 --> 09:29.986
We're close.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.946
Soon now we'll be safe.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.240
Soon better be real soon, dude.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.784
My friend is hurt,
and those guys are still after us.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.619
Do not worry, Amanda.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.163
Once we reach the village
of the Bofuki Nepoo,

09:41.164 --> 09:43.083
Wakti Wapnasi will
explain everything.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.836
She can protect us.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.629
Where are we, boss?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.089
I don't know, Vogel.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.882
Who were those guys
in the koo-koo costumes?

09:51.883 --> 09:53.384
I told you, I don't know.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.344
Hey, boss,
who's Wakti Wapnasi?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.637
I don't know.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.972
Okay?

09:57.973 --> 10:01.225
I don't know anything
that's going on, all right?

10:01.226 --> 10:03.269
I don't know where we are,

10:03.270 --> 10:04.687
I don't know
why this is happening,

10:04.688 --> 10:07.189
I don't know how I did the
thing with the lightning.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.026
You know, my life
was really weird before,

10:10.027 --> 10:11.485
but this is just next level,

10:11.486 --> 10:13.529
so please do not ask me
any more questions,

10:13.530 --> 10:14.740
because I don't have
any answers!

10:17.200 --> 10:19.493
Vogel, I'm sorry.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.704
I just...

10:25.083 --> 10:27.002
Farson?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.298
Hello?

10:53.362 --> 10:55.196
Dirk, do you think
there's a chance

10:55.197 --> 10:56.864
that he could be The Boy
you're looking for?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.825
Farah said some of the height notches
in the house were marked A.C.,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.243
and that's him,
Arnold Cardenas.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.996
Look! I ran his plates
like a real cop.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.374
He's been Arnold Freedman
since '75.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.708
No wonder we couldn't find him.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.502
- I totally thought you were playing a game.
- What?

11:09.503 --> 11:10.336
Look at him.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.796
He looks miserable.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.631
We shouldn't have
brought him here.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.216
We should've waited,
we should've just...

11:15.217 --> 11:17.426
If we didn't come with,
he would've come without us.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.719
He wouldn't have
come at all

11:18.720 --> 11:20.471
if I hadn't been there stupidly
waving those photos around.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.307
You insisted
we go out for breakfast.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.642
I didn't know
it was going to be a clue!

11:24.643 --> 11:27.687
I can't control this at all!

11:27.688 --> 11:29.730
It's just like
everything I do is just--

11:29.731 --> 11:31.065
Dirk, slow down, man.
Be cool.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.110
I don't want this situation
to get abruptly monstery, or scissory,

11:34.111 --> 11:36.612
or any of the other things
situations have been getting lately.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.907
I want this to be a relaxing stroll
down memory lane

11:39.908 --> 11:42.493
that conveniently tells us
everything we need to know,

11:42.494 --> 11:43.911
resolves all loose threads,

11:43.912 --> 11:46.372
and makes us all feel great
about our choices

11:46.373 --> 11:50.668
in the most boring,
uneventful way possible.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.337
And he's going into the house.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.425
Look, wait, Todd!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.770
How did this happen?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.772
Who tore down the wallpaper?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.357
We did.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.608
It was an accident.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.988
My father put the wallpaper up
to cover this...as punishment.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.701
Do you know what this is?

12:23.702 --> 12:24.619
Of course.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.290
Wendimoor.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.130
This is
the Valley of the Inglenook.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.465
and there,

12:37.466 --> 12:39.884
there's the pink-haired ones,

12:39.885 --> 12:41.260
the Trosts.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.803
They were the farmers.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.680
And the Dengdamors,
they were, ooh...

12:44.681 --> 12:46.307
the rich folk.

12:46.308 --> 12:50.144
And then in the woods,
all kinds of monsters.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.688
the rainbow monsters,
the furry monsters,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.399
and then
the old snail witch.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.360
And look, there's The Mage.

12:58.361 --> 13:01.238
He was the villain.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.324
You see how he always loses?

13:03.325 --> 13:06.118
The hero defeats him,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.662
and he locks him
in a train in the sky

13:08.663 --> 13:12.292
that goes 'round
and 'round forever and ever.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.922
This was the plan
for how it was going to be.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.469
Until it all fell apart.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.517
Where is my mother?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.228
And papi?

13:32.854 --> 13:35.105
It's like water, you know?

13:35.106 --> 13:37.608
You let yourself sink in,

13:37.609 --> 13:39.068
you kind of float along,

13:39.069 --> 13:41.111
and it shows you what to do.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.614
The universe shows you
what to do?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.241
Where were you born?

13:45.242 --> 13:46.535
Who are your parents?

13:48.662 --> 13:50.496
Oh, I don't know,
I don't remember.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.165
They... they died.

13:54.835 --> 13:58.546
My childhood
was kinder than yours.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.423
I studied the sword,

14:01.424 --> 14:03.634
but between that
there was singing...

14:03.635 --> 14:05.344
dancing.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.638
Yeah, no dancing for me.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.349
I was alone for a long time,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.852
and then these guys,
they put me in this place,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.979
and they tried to get me
to do stuff.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.731
They don't get how I work.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.316
You know, and those jerks,

14:19.317 --> 14:21.945
those are the same stupids
that took my friend Ken.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.073
So I figure,
I am just gonna sit here,

14:26.074 --> 14:28.033
and I ain't killing anybody.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.160
I'm sorry your life
has been hard, Bartine.

14:30.161 --> 14:34.290
If this world
has treated you badly,

14:34.291 --> 14:35.958
perhaps it's time to leave it.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.752
You mean like, you'd...

14:38.753 --> 14:40.421
let me come to Wendimoor?

14:40.422 --> 14:43.924
Not my choice to make.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.719
But if the time comes,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.722
perhaps it can be yours.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.062
We need to question
Scott Boreton.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.357
It's-it's a lot of moving pieces,
and I-I'm getting overwhelmed.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.775
I mean, we can agree

15:01.776 --> 15:03.777
that the Cardenas house is
at the center of this, right?

15:03.778 --> 15:04.904
It's the key.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.115
So why-why can't we just focus
on one weird thing at a time?

15:08.116 --> 15:09.408
Because everything--

15:09.409 --> 15:12.494
Because everything
is connected, right, right.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.580
Let's focus
on Suzie Boreton.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.789
Okay, Suzie said

15:15.790 --> 15:18.292
Scott was talking about
people from a fairytale.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.045
That's Wendimoor.

15:21.046 --> 15:24.674
That connects the Boretons
to the Cardenas house.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.760
So, what do we say?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.596
We say, "Sorry, Scott,
your mom is suspected of..."

15:30.597 --> 15:32.640
What?

15:32.641 --> 15:34.808
"Attacking a psycho with shapes?

15:34.809 --> 15:37.311
Turning people into dust?"

15:37.312 --> 15:41.023
If we can bring in Scott
on suspicion of animal cruelty,

15:41.024 --> 15:43.067
Scott's a minor.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.319
Legally, she'd have to come in.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.654
"Sound of Nothing"

15:46.655 --> 15:48.238
is Southern Montana's
third-largest music festival.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.075
You know, finding Scott there
will be like finding a needle in a haystack.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.785
Oh, we just have
to get Dirk there.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.954
He collects needles
in haystacks.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.289
He does, doesn't he?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.249
Ms. Black, I think you're...

15:59.250 --> 16:00.126
You're ringing there.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.049
I thought I was the one
who was supposed to call you.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.218
You have to come in. Now.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.179
Eddie, I told you,
this is not up for discussion--

16:12.180 --> 16:13.180
<i>You were right, Farah.</i>

16:13.181 --> 16:14.682
Blackwing is active.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.183
<i>I've got sources telling me</i>

16:16.184 --> 16:18.310
<i>they've activated assets
in Montana.</i>

16:18.311 --> 16:20.354
Eddie...

16:20.355 --> 16:22.314
Okay, I need details--

16:22.315 --> 16:23.816
You've been playing
cops and robbers

16:23.817 --> 16:26.151
with freaks and crazy people
too long.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.278
This isn't what Dad
would've wanted.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.990
<i>Farah? Farah!</i>

17:00.353 --> 17:02.188
Hello?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.446
Are you a... thing?

17:13.408 --> 17:18.412
"Are you... a... thing?"

17:18.413 --> 17:21.874
What a wonderful question.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.835
Oh, I wonder what the answer is.

17:24.836 --> 17:28.005
Are you a person in there?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.593
First perhaps a thing,
now possibly a person.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.179
Aw...

17:36.890 --> 17:38.932
Where's my friend?
His name is Vogel.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.435
Don't worry, he's fine.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.895
Okay.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.106
Oh, how quickly things
have been changing for you,

17:46.107 --> 17:47.984
Amanda Brotzman.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.032
Is this like...

17:55.033 --> 17:57.493
Is it gonna keep going
like this?

17:57.494 --> 18:00.037
Tell me more
about how it's going.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.122
You know, I tried
to roll with the punches,

18:02.123 --> 18:03.040
I did,

18:03.041 --> 18:04.750
but now...

18:04.751 --> 18:06.502
this!

18:08.129 --> 18:10.172
...is ridiculous.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.594
I brought you here
for a reason, Amanda.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.389
You're the voice.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.725
You're the voice
that I hear in my visions.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.520
Surprise!

18:24.979 --> 18:26.939
Am I dreaming?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.066
Perhaps I could say something
to comfort you.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.318
There's nothing
you could possibly say

18:31.319 --> 18:33.028
that would do that.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.905
Not even...

18:34.906 --> 18:39.202
"Everything is connected"?

18:44.290 --> 18:48.377
You people have no idea
what you're dealing with!

18:48.378 --> 18:51.505
I should never
have gone back!

18:51.506 --> 18:54.299
The '67 was my fault!

18:54.300 --> 18:57.219
It was an electromagnetic pulse.
How could that be your fault?

18:57.220 --> 18:58.846
Also, you would have
been, like, 12.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.807
I wish that boat
had never fallen from the sky!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.267
Boat?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.686
Like the Infant Male
Pollock Francis?

19:05.687 --> 19:07.688
Wait, how have I not heard
about this until now?

19:07.689 --> 19:10.858
A boat fell from the sky,
and with a name like that?

19:10.859 --> 19:12.776
We're trying to help.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.695
Strange things have been
happening in this town,

19:14.696 --> 19:17.239
and we think they might be related
to your parents' deaths.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.282
It's impossible.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.908
Now, why do you say that?

19:19.909 --> 19:22.119
Because everything strange stopped.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.163
All the strange stuff is over!

19:24.164 --> 19:25.247
I saw to that!

19:25.248 --> 19:26.206
I ended it!

19:26.207 --> 19:27.666
Ended it? How?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.001
I'm sorry, Mr. Cardenas,

19:29.002 --> 19:32.380
but whatever happened
in that house isn't over.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.805
Breathe.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.808
Start simple.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.644
How did the government
get involved?

19:47.645 --> 19:49.938
There were sightings.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.775
Things from the dreams.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.862
At first, the things
from the dreams were nice,

19:56.863 --> 20:00.073
they were gifts for our family,

20:00.074 --> 20:02.159
but then they got dangerous.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.746
The air gun,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.957
and people saw the monster
from the song flying around.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.335
They thought
it was an alien.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.502
The monster
from the song,

20:12.503 --> 20:14.463
The Flying
Purple People Eater

20:14.464 --> 20:16.340
from the House
Within A House.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.592
That was another of the gifts,
wasn't it?

20:18.593 --> 20:20.928
But-but something ruined it.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.680
Something with-with
overturned flowers,

20:23.681 --> 20:25.224
something
with scissors, perhaps?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.683
You lie!

20:26.684 --> 20:29.269
You know what I did!
You know what I did!

20:29.270 --> 20:30.646
I didn't have a choice!

20:30.647 --> 20:31.897
I didn't have
a choice!

20:31.898 --> 20:33.649
I got it. Okay.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.360
I'll put him in the storage locker to cool off.
I got it. I got it.

20:36.361 --> 20:37.527
Into the storage locker to cool off.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.487
You okay?

20:38.488 --> 20:42.532
No! Is everyone I attempt to help
going to try to kill me, Todd?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.368
He clearly went through
a traumatic experience.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.120
I know.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.580
He wants to talk,

20:48.581 --> 20:51.041
otherwise he wouldn't have
come in.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.627
We'll let him sober up,
and then--

20:56.506 --> 20:57.465
Stay away from me.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.301
Hobbs? Hobbs?

21:01.302 --> 21:02.928
This was supposed to be a toy.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.513
Hobbs, what the hell--

21:04.514 --> 21:06.598
It's not yours.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.434
That thing they brought home
from the boat wasn't human!

21:09.435 --> 21:11.144
It wasn't human!

21:11.145 --> 21:12.479
I did what I had to!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.605
Uh...

21:13.606 --> 21:14.440
Whoa!

21:17.235 --> 21:18.694
You...

21:18.695 --> 21:20.779
No, you're...

21:20.780 --> 21:21.989
you're one of them.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.074
That's not possible.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.200
You... you can't...

21:25.201 --> 21:27.120
you can't exist!

21:29.289 --> 21:30.664
That's not possible!

21:32.834 --> 21:34.001
Mr. Cardenas!

21:34.002 --> 21:35.752
Arnold?
Oh, my god!

21:35.753 --> 21:36.670
What's wrong?

21:36.671 --> 21:38.505
What's happening to him?

21:38.506 --> 21:40.090
He's having a heart attack.

21:40.091 --> 21:40.967
I got the gun!

21:47.140 --> 21:48.433
I did nothing.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.312
So you know
how my visions work?

21:53.313 --> 21:55.272
Mm-hmm.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.690
Are you the one
that causes them?

21:56.691 --> 21:57.899
No, no, no.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.901
You see through your inner eye.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.696
My inner eye?

22:02.697 --> 22:04.406
Seriously?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.033
Come on...

22:06.034 --> 22:08.201
Answer a question--

22:08.202 --> 22:12.205
who are you?

22:12.206 --> 22:14.750
Amanda Brotzman?

22:14.751 --> 22:18.420
That is just a noise
people can make to refer to you.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.255
You're not your name.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.592
Who are you?

22:24.552 --> 22:27.180
I'm... from Oregon?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.641
I, uh...

22:31.642 --> 22:32.934
When I was 20, I had--

22:32.935 --> 22:35.771
These are just things
that happened to your body.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.189
Who are you?

22:40.902 --> 22:44.821
Um, when I think,

22:44.822 --> 22:48.158
I hear a voice in my head?

22:48.159 --> 22:50.869
I am the brain
having those thoughts?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.122
If you're the one
hearing the voice in your head,

22:54.123 --> 22:56.625
then who are you?

22:56.626 --> 23:01.963
I... am the consciousness

23:01.964 --> 23:06.134
that controls the body of,

23:06.135 --> 23:09.721
sees through the eyes of,

23:09.722 --> 23:12.641
and hears the thoughts
of Amanda Brotzman.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.771
That thing,

23:17.772 --> 23:19.064
your consciousness,

23:19.065 --> 23:20.816
is very special.

23:20.817 --> 23:24.277
The visions that I see,

23:24.278 --> 23:25.529
they aren't me.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.531
They're just something
the Rowdy 3 do to me.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.659
They give you access
to something deeper.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.454
Underneath your pain,
your fear, even your thoughts,

23:34.455 --> 23:35.747
there is a power.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.833
In a place like this,

23:37.834 --> 23:40.252
a person like you
is very special.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.461
With training,

23:41.462 --> 23:44.256
you could learn to see
everything, go anywhere.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.176
That is the gift
hidden within you.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.512
I'm just a person.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.306
I'm just a sick person.

23:54.851 --> 23:55.893
Mm...

23:57.478 --> 23:59.689
You recognize this,
don't you?

24:00.857 --> 24:02.774
It looks like my visions.

24:02.775 --> 24:07.612
And perhaps,
as a simple, sick person,

24:07.613 --> 24:10.992
you would like to know
a little bit more?

24:13.411 --> 24:14.828
Hmm?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.708
Nice looking boy.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.793
Leave Scott out of this.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.463
If you wanted to protect him,

24:24.464 --> 24:26.256
perhaps you shouldn't have
used him as bait.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.717
You want me
to get Dirk Gently,

24:28.718 --> 24:31.011
and I'm going to do that, okay?

24:31.012 --> 24:35.182
But there are going to be
a lot of people at that concert.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.808
What if somebody gets hurt?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.478
There must be a spell
or something,

24:39.479 --> 24:41.188
some sort of peaceful way
to deal with--

24:46.110 --> 24:48.069
This is your test, Suzanne.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.780
Dirk Gently is the only thing

24:50.781 --> 24:52.616
that stands between me

24:52.617 --> 24:54.159
and finally understanding
the truth of the world

24:54.160 --> 24:56.286
that I--

24:56.287 --> 24:57.537
We--

24:57.538 --> 25:00.165
will soon control.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.751
Abandon the rules
of this world, Suzanne.

25:02.752 --> 25:06.046
They've never
helped you be happy.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.591
It's time you showed the world
your real power.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.313
I better follow them,

25:23.314 --> 25:25.899
make sure he gets
checked into the hospital in Somerset.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.569
Plus, someone's going to need
to swing by with the tow truck

25:29.570 --> 25:31.905
to pick up Arnold's car
from the Cardenas place, so...

25:31.906 --> 25:33.949
Oh, Hobbs, I didn't--

25:33.950 --> 25:35.700
what about finding Scott
at Sound of Nothing?

25:35.701 --> 25:37.619
You know, then it would
just be me and everyone,

25:37.620 --> 25:38.662
and I don't think that--

25:38.663 --> 25:40.872
Hey, Tina, you're gonna
be fine, all right?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.832
I'll be back in a jiff.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.543
Farah...

25:44.544 --> 25:46.795
I am so sorry
I messed this up.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.838
I cannot believe
I took him to evidence.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.674
I just put the dang pop gun
in there this morning.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.300
You do know you're
apologizing to someone

25:52.301 --> 25:54.219
wanted by the FBI,

25:54.220 --> 25:55.221
right?

25:56.764 --> 25:58.640
Just...

25:58.641 --> 26:01.018
Just keep everyone
safe tonight?

26:03.271 --> 26:05.021
Come here.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.439
Yup, you're gonna
be fine.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.817
Okay.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.241
You want us to go
to a music festival?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.909
Shouldn't we just
go to the hospital,

26:17.910 --> 26:19.744
or go back
to the Cardenas house?

26:19.745 --> 26:21.580
There must have been
something we missed there.

26:21.581 --> 26:22.914
Or the boat,

26:22.915 --> 26:23.832
the boat in the field.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.042
Scott Boreton.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.210
Arrows point to him

26:27.211 --> 26:29.296
as potentially having
concrete information.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.547
Plus,
less serious,

26:30.548 --> 26:32.882
less, like, stress,

26:32.883 --> 26:35.093
and we just, like, hang out.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.386
I agree.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.972
I like this. Yes.
Very Farah.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.390
Logic.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.433
Deduction.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.393
Tracking down a suspect,

26:43.394 --> 26:45.687
not just, "Duh! Pip cheerio,

26:45.688 --> 26:48.064
fabric of the universe,
everything connect-o, duh!"

26:48.065 --> 26:50.692
Are you doing a sarcastic
impression of yourself?

26:50.693 --> 26:51.860
What I am saying is,

26:51.861 --> 26:53.612
we followed the holistic road
today already, Todd,

26:53.613 --> 26:55.322
and it ended up with a man dead.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.699
He's not dead.
They said he had a minor heart attack.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.785
He's very muchly more dead
than he was when he woke up this morning.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.829
He's, like,
five-out-of-eight dead-ish.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.164
Are you giving up on him?

27:04.165 --> 27:05.498
I thought you thought
he was The Boy?

27:05.499 --> 27:08.793
I thought I thought
he could have been "a" The Boy,

27:08.794 --> 27:11.004
but certainly not "the" The Boy,

27:11.005 --> 27:12.547
considering he was an old man,

27:12.548 --> 27:13.590
did you not notice?

27:13.591 --> 27:15.592
Maybe Scott Boreton's
The Boy.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.637
Maybe Scott Boreton is The Boy.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.513
We need to find
where Wendimoor is.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.891
Don't you think that...

27:23.392 --> 27:25.101
Farah, are you seriously
going along

27:25.102 --> 27:27.103
with this whole Scott thing?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.648
It's our only real lead.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.735
Fine.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.655
But I'm not going to a concert
dressed like a cop.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.240
Yeah!

28:08.020 --> 28:09.562
Oh, that was weird,
that hurt.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.190
What did you see?

28:12.692 --> 28:15.151
I thought I saw
one of my friends.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.611
Why can't you just
bring them through,

28:16.612 --> 28:17.946
like you did with me?

28:17.947 --> 28:19.906
My reach
is very limited.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.283
Your talent is greater.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.202
You have
an important role to play

28:24.203 --> 28:26.079
in things to come...

28:26.080 --> 28:27.747
if you survive.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.500
"If" I survive?

28:30.918 --> 28:32.627
I thought
you could see the future.

28:32.628 --> 28:36.506
Fate and chance
are not mutually exclusive,

28:36.507 --> 28:38.425
and alongside them
exists free will.

28:38.426 --> 28:42.971
This is only your first step

28:42.972 --> 28:44.723
to something much greater,

28:44.724 --> 28:47.392
in this world

28:47.393 --> 28:49.854
and beyond.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.114
Whoa!

29:01.115 --> 29:04.160
Get your mitts off me,
ya doofy-faced creepazoids!

29:05.244 --> 29:06.287
Relax...

29:07.872 --> 29:10.123
You're among friends,
Sir Vogel.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.126
These are
the Bofuki Nepoo.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.505
Where is Amanda?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.799
She's in with the Wood Witch,

29:19.800 --> 29:21.719
trying to find your friends.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.822
Somethin' bad's coming.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.207
Hey.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.167
You know, that wasn't your fault.

29:54.168 --> 29:57.212
What if he was The Boy?

29:57.213 --> 30:00.840
What if he was the only person
who could save my world?

30:00.841 --> 30:03.803
Can you speak to the universe?
Ask it why it's doing this?

30:04.929 --> 30:06.847
It don't work like that.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.893
Hey...

30:22.571 --> 30:24.614
What are you doing?

30:24.615 --> 30:28.910
You said when you was little
you did the dancing, right?

30:28.911 --> 30:30.912
Was it like, uh...

30:30.913 --> 30:32.414
Like this?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.253
Whoo! Woop!

30:43.926 --> 30:46.761
No, not like that.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.936
What's up?

30:54.937 --> 30:56.145
Are you nervous?

30:56.146 --> 30:57.814
I mean, more nervous
than usual?

30:57.815 --> 30:59.732
I've just got a lot on my mind.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.943
I talked to my brother.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.528
What, seriously?

31:03.529 --> 31:05.822
He thinks Blackwing
might be onto us.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.198
They might be
in Montana.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.242
Okay, don't tell Dirk.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.159
He's already on edge.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.536
It'll just
freak him out even more.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.329
You're not worried?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.248
It feels like
we're close to Wendimoor.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.958
That's what we have
to focus on, right?

31:16.959 --> 31:18.918
Hey, at least
we look cool.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.211
Yeah.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.506
What? For 1986,
we look very cool.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.009
Can I tell you
a secret?

31:26.010 --> 31:29.971
I have never been
to a concert before.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.931
Is that a secret?

31:31.932 --> 31:33.349
Shut up.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.226
There are a lot
of people in there.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.897
They just put this right on my head
without even asking.

31:38.898 --> 31:39.939
Nice hat.

31:39.940 --> 31:40.815
Guys...

31:40.816 --> 31:42.067
Come on, come on, come on.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.612
I have an idea.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.113
We split up, I use my thing--

31:47.114 --> 31:48.323
- Your badge?
- Right.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.282
Todd and I go on stage,

31:49.283 --> 31:50.700
and check out the crowd
from the front.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.493
You and Dirk use his thing--

31:52.494 --> 31:54.245
His innate connection
to the fabric of reality.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.371
Right,

31:55.372 --> 31:57.081
and you take it
from the back.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.667
Are you sure it's necessary
to go on stage?

31:59.668 --> 32:01.961
Yes, very necessary,

32:01.962 --> 32:03.004
definitely necessary,

32:03.005 --> 32:05.173
and probably vital
to the investigation.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.145
Dirk, are... are you
feeling anything yet?

32:19.146 --> 32:20.396
Not how it works.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.607
Come on, Farah, you should
know that by now.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.651
Dirk, we're just...

32:24.652 --> 32:26.319
We need to find
Scott Boreton.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.154
So... focus!

32:28.155 --> 32:31.115
Focus? There are
teens sweating on me,

32:31.116 --> 32:32.617
real teens!

32:32.618 --> 32:35.870
This music sounds like robots
being tortured by monkeys!

32:35.871 --> 32:38.331
I am never going to find
Scott Boreton in this mayhem!

32:38.332 --> 32:40.458
My name is Scott Boreton--

32:40.459 --> 32:42.543
Hey, watch it, man,
I'm trying to take a video!

32:42.544 --> 32:44.629
Oh, this is just stupid now.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.381
Nice work, Dirk.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.132
I'll take that.
Scott Boreton.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.133
What?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.426
Bergsberg County
Police Department.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.719
We'd like to have
a word with you.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.347
Okay, I-I don't know anything
about that weird guy

32:54.348 --> 32:55.598
who got hit by the car.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.392
- Let's just have a word outside.
- Don't touch me!

32:57.393 --> 32:59.395
Okay! Hey!
Get back here!

33:01.105 --> 33:02.730
Farah?

33:16.203 --> 33:17.662
Grab your weapons!

33:17.663 --> 33:19.540
Grab your weapons!

33:23.460 --> 33:25.128
What is that?

33:25.129 --> 33:26.379
The Kellum Knights.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.839
Men of The Mage.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.633
You could defeat them, Amanda.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.176
I don't know how to have

33:32.177 --> 33:34.595
one of those magical
seizure things again.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.888
I can't fight them.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.309
Then reach across reality,
find someone who can.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.737
Have you seen Scott yet?

33:50.738 --> 33:52.071
Uh, no, not yet.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.407
Turn around.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.367
Look! They found him.

33:56.493 --> 33:57.326
Get out of the way!

33:57.327 --> 33:59.663
Scott! Stop!

34:00.956 --> 34:02.999
Wait!
That's Suzie Boreton.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.917
She looks different.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.549
Farah?

34:12.259 --> 34:14.927
Shit, looks like
she's headed for Dirk.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.263
Is that the wand thing?

34:17.222 --> 34:18.347
She's magic!

34:18.348 --> 34:20.683
She's the dangerous one,
not Scott!

34:20.684 --> 34:22.519
Dirk! Dirk!

34:24.063 --> 34:25.272
Dirk!

34:26.607 --> 34:28.442
Dirk!

34:30.110 --> 34:31.069
Farah!

34:31.070 --> 34:33.362
Idiot! Back off!

34:33.363 --> 34:34.781
<i>Here is the man
you've been waiting for,</i>

34:34.782 --> 34:37.283
<i>DJ Applesauce!</i>

34:47.127 --> 34:50.588
I need a calm spell!
I need to place a peace spell!

34:50.589 --> 34:52.132
Wenefria! Oh!

35:05.229 --> 35:07.355
My hands feel amazing.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.650
No!

35:10.234 --> 35:11.275
No! No!

35:11.276 --> 35:13.319
Isn't it crazy?

35:13.320 --> 35:15.781
It's totally perfect.

35:17.116 --> 35:20.284
No! No! No...

35:20.285 --> 35:23.746
The lights look like heaven!

35:23.747 --> 35:24.664
Dirk!

35:24.665 --> 35:25.665
Todd!

35:25.666 --> 35:26.624
Dirk!

35:26.625 --> 35:28.584
You need to know,
you changed my life.

35:28.585 --> 35:31.045
You showed me everything
I'd been doing wrong!

35:31.046 --> 35:33.005
I didn't believe
in anything,

35:33.006 --> 35:34.966
and my life felt
so small,

35:34.967 --> 35:37.009
and I treated other people
like they were small too.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.178
That's bad!
That's... lame!

35:39.179 --> 35:40.596
That's over!

35:40.597 --> 35:43.141
We went back in time, man!

35:43.142 --> 35:44.058
Remember?

35:45.144 --> 35:47.019
I believe Wendimoor is real!

35:47.020 --> 35:49.147
We're gonna find The Boy,
and find Amanda,

35:49.148 --> 35:50.940
and we're gonna be
best friends forever!

35:50.941 --> 35:53.276
Todd, you saying this to me

35:53.277 --> 35:55.319
is the single most important thing

35:55.320 --> 35:58.781
that has ever happened
in my entire life.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.409
You are the first person
I've ever met

36:01.410 --> 36:02.910
who actually wanted me around!

36:02.911 --> 36:03.828
I didn't at first--

36:03.829 --> 36:04.745
Not at first--

36:04.746 --> 36:06.831
- But I caught on, I evolved!
- Yes! Yes!

36:06.832 --> 36:09.417
But, listen, Todd,
I think something's been done to us,

36:09.418 --> 36:11.794
possibly supernatural,

36:11.795 --> 36:12.920
and it is...

36:12.921 --> 36:14.130
great!

36:15.591 --> 36:17.383
Todd! Hi!
Hey, Dirk!

36:17.384 --> 36:18.968
- Farah!
- Hey!

36:18.969 --> 36:19.969
Aw...

36:19.970 --> 36:22.221
My dad died!

36:22.222 --> 36:24.098
What? Are-are you--

36:24.099 --> 36:25.141
I-I-I'm okay!

36:25.142 --> 36:27.602
I mean, he...
he was sick for years,

36:27.603 --> 36:29.270
and he hated me!

36:30.939 --> 36:32.732
I don't know,
he just...

36:32.733 --> 36:34.233
he always made me feel

36:34.234 --> 36:35.818
like I was such
a disappointment, you know?

36:35.819 --> 36:38.863
Like I was never good enough,

36:38.864 --> 36:40.948
but I know that
that's bullshit now, you know?

36:40.949 --> 36:41.949
That's not real!

36:41.950 --> 36:44.660
And-- Oh, Todd,
remember that time

36:44.661 --> 36:47.121
we were making out
behind that restaurant

36:47.122 --> 36:49.123
in Nevada, like,
three weeks ago, and--

36:49.124 --> 36:50.958
You guys made out?

36:50.959 --> 36:52.418
It's been two months, Dirk,
we're adults--

36:52.419 --> 36:53.669
Dirk, we're adults!

36:53.670 --> 36:56.464
I... I just wanted
you to know that

36:56.465 --> 36:58.382
that was the moment that I knew,

36:58.383 --> 37:01.260
I knew I didn't need
Eddie or anyone,

37:01.261 --> 37:02.803
because...

37:02.804 --> 37:04.513
I'm not like them.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.642
This is
where I'm supposed to be!

37:07.643 --> 37:10.353
I mean, I'm...
I'm one of the freaks!

37:10.354 --> 37:11.395
Yes! Yes!

37:11.396 --> 37:13.689
I love yelling "Yes!"

37:13.690 --> 37:17.151
I want to
everybody here!

37:38.257 --> 37:41.300
Don't give up.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.685
I found them.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.732
I can't!

37:56.733 --> 37:57.943
Help me!

38:14.251 --> 38:15.126
Yo.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.794
Aw, yeah!

38:41.570 --> 38:49.702
<i>♪ Alive ♪</i>

39:12.351 --> 39:14.894
I don't understand.

39:14.895 --> 39:18.440
Who made this?

39:20.025 --> 39:22.110
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.866
This is all a mistake.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.246
Tina...

39:34.247 --> 39:35.873
I been trying to reach you
all night,

39:35.874 --> 39:37.583
and I know you charged
your phone this time.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.293
I saw you plug it in.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.920
So, listen, I'd like to set up
some sort of meet-up,

39:40.921 --> 39:42.254
because, um--

39:44.174 --> 39:45.133
Wait...

39:47.636 --> 39:49.638
Wait, wait, wait.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.772
What in the heck?

40:00.190 --> 40:01.650
I'll call you back.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.354
...the hell?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.533
Bob?

40:56.830 --> 40:58.165
Where's the truck, Bob?

41:00.834 --> 41:02.418
What's happening here?

41:05.714 --> 41:08.757
Poor Sheriff Hobbs,

41:08.758 --> 41:10.676
I'm afraid
you've caught me

41:10.677 --> 41:12.220
at a very bad time.
