12:18.085 --> 12:21.479
HEY, WE MIGHT NOT BE CBI,
BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.481
[cell phone rings]OKAY. EXCUSE ME.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.224
YEP?

12:27.224 --> 12:29.096
RIGSBY, WHERE ARE YOU?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.881
OUTSIDE THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
LOOKS LIKE SMITH'S INSIDE.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.361
ARE THERE POLICEMEN WITH YOU?

12:33.361 --> 12:34.536
YEAH. WHY?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.929
OKAY, LISTEN CAREFULLY.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.496
DO NOT TRUST ANYONE
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.542
ANYONE AT ALL.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:40.542 --> 12:43.066
YOU GOT IT. THANKS.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.242
[chuckles]

12:45.242 --> 12:47.244
LET'S, UH, GO TAKE A LOOK

12:47.244 --> 12:48.202
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.510
CAR'S BACK THIS WAY.[groaning]

12:52.510 --> 12:54.251
EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.732
WE GOT A SAFE HOUSE NEARBY,
FRESH CLOTHES, A DOCTOR...

12:56.732 --> 12:58.908
A TRIP OUT OF TOWN.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.302
A SAFE HOUSE, HUH?
[groans]

13:01.302 --> 13:03.608
YOU KNOW, I SAID THAT
TO SOMEONE ONCE.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.568
YEAH? WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT?

13:07.743 --> 13:10.093
I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES
IN THE BACK.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.444
COME ON.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.231
AH...

13:17.231 --> 13:18.841

[continues panting]

14:08.325 --> 14:09.805
[handcuffs click]

14:09.805 --> 14:11.328
SMITH GOT AWAY
DURING THE FIGHT.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.939
SO DID THE DETECTIVE.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.811
BOSS, THEY WERE TRYING
TO KILL SMITH AND US. WHY?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.334
I DON'T KNOW.CHECK THE SHOULDER.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.032
WHAT?ASK HIM TO CHECK
THE LEFT SHOULDER.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.686
HAVE RIGSBY TAKE HIS SHIRT
OFF AND LOOK AT HIS SHOULDER.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.080
LISBON WANTS YOU TO CHECK
HIS LEFT SHOULDER.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.039
[grunts]

14:28.345 --> 14:30.391
WHAT THE HELL?

14:30.391 --> 14:32.741
HE'S GOT IT.
HE'S GOT THE TATTOO.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.656
BOSS, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:34.656 --> 14:35.875
ALL RIGHT, BRING HIM IN

14:35.875 --> 14:37.137
AND DON'T LET ANYBODY ELSE
GET TO HIM.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.008
[elevator bell dings]

14:39.008 --> 14:40.183
BRING HIM IN.

14:47.321 --> 14:50.846
[indistinct conversations]

14:50.846 --> 14:53.022
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE COP WHO ATTACKED YOU?

14:53.022 --> 14:55.764
THIS IS THE ONE WE CAUGHT.
OFFICER PAUL WIEHAGEN.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.766
SIX YEARS ON THE FORCE.
EXEMPLARY RECORD,

14:57.766 --> 15:00.421
A COUPLE OF COMMENDATIONS,
NO REAL DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.858
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE--
DETECTIVE CORDERO?PUT A CALL IN TO HIS CAPTAIN.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.207
SAID HE CALLED IN SICK
AN HOUR AGO.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.905
AND STILL NO SIGN OF BERTRAM.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.558
LET'S FOCUS ON THE ONE
WE DO HAVE.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.343
MAYBE JANE
WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.607
DID SOMEONE SEND YOU
TO KILL REEDE SMITH?

15:14.391 --> 15:15.697
I GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.394
WHY WERE YOU GONNA
MURDER HIM?

15:21.572 --> 15:23.879
WHAT ABOUT THE TATTOO?
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.927
[breathes sharply]

15:27.927 --> 15:30.799
YOU'RE NOT A BIG TALKER.
I GET IT.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.106
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS
AND ALL THAT.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.152
THE BAD NEWS IS,
YOU HAVE A LOUSY POKER FACE.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.763
SO WE'RE GONNA PLAY A LITTLE
GAME OF SHOW-AND-TELL.

15:38.763 --> 15:41.027
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,
AND YOU'RE GONNA SHOW ME

15:41.027 --> 15:44.247
WITH YOUR FACE
WHETHER I'M RIGHT OR NOT.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.249
THAT SOUND FUN? [snickers]

15:46.249 --> 15:50.340
YOU EVER STEAL ANYTHING?

15:50.340 --> 15:51.863
DID YOU EVER CHEAT
ON YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

15:53.735 --> 15:54.997
HIT HER?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.607
DO YOU LIKE CAUSING PAIN?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.870
I NEVER HIT A WOMAN
IN MY LIFE.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.916
DO YOU BELONG TO A SECRET
ORGANIZATION OF COPS

16:00.916 --> 16:02.700
AND OTHER
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.964
[scoffs]

16:04.964 --> 16:06.922
YES.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.228
YOU'VE COMMITTED CRIMES

16:08.228 --> 16:10.752
ON BEHALF OF THAT
ORGANIZATION BEFORE.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.582
RIGHT?

16:14.582 --> 16:19.065
AGENT SMITH IS A MEMBER
ALSO...

16:19.065 --> 16:20.936
RIGHT?

16:20.936 --> 16:23.373
THE ORGANIZATION SENT YOU
TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

16:23.373 --> 16:25.941
TO KILL HIM... RIGHT?

16:27.638 --> 16:30.598
CBI DIRECTOR GAIL BERTRAM
IS ALSO A MEMBER.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.862
YOU DON'T KNOW.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.647
TOO LOW
ON THE TOTEM POLE, HUH?

16:36.647 --> 16:39.868
AGENT REEDE SMITH
IS RED JOHN.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.957
DON'T KNOW.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.873
GAIL BERTRAM'S RED JOHN.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.094
DON'T KNOW.

16:49.399 --> 16:52.533
THAT TATTOO ON YOUR SHOULDER
IS THE MEMBERSHIP SIGN.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.406
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.581
RIGHT AGAIN.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.455
THERE'S A PASSWORD, TOO--

17:01.455 --> 17:04.632
SOMETHING YOU SAY
AS A GREETING OR A...

17:04.632 --> 17:06.460
DISTRESS SIGNAL.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.506
"TIGER, TIGER."

17:09.506 --> 17:11.813
[breathes heavily]

17:11.813 --> 17:14.337
GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.296
A SECRET SOCIETY
OF DIRTY COPS.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.689
AND RED JOHN'S A MEMBER.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.213
PARTRIDGE.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.911
HE SAID "TIGER, TIGER" TO ME
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.305
HMM. YES. YES.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.089
HE WAS ASKING FOR HELP

17:27.089 --> 17:29.178
IN THE HOPES
THAT YOU WERE A MEMBER.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.527
BUT IF HE HAD A TATTOO,

17:30.527 --> 17:32.051
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IN THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.487
WELL, YOU CAN'T TRUST
A FILE.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.705
WE HAVE TO SEE IT.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.490
I'LL HAVE CHO
TRACK DOWN THE BODY.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.318
BUT PARTRIDGE COULD BE
BURIED BY NOW.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
WELL, HAVE CHO BRING
A SHOVEL.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.539
THE TEAM'S LOOKING FOR SMITH,
BERTRAM'S ON THE RUN.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.845
SO WHO'S RED JOHN?

17:43.845 --> 17:45.673
IS IT BERTRAM OR SMITH?

17:47.153 --> 17:50.547
I NEED TO LOOK THEM
BOTH IN THE EYE.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.637
[switch clicks, flame whooshes]YEAH, THE CORONER RELEASED
HIS BODY, LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.249
MURDER VICTIM, HUH?YEAH.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.426
I FIGURED. THAT'S WHY
WE HELD HIM FOR SO LONG.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.080
GOOD THING YOU GOT HERE TODAY.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.169
TOMORROW THERE WON'T BE
MUCH LEFT OF HIM TO LOOK AT.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.692
HERE WE GO.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.041
BRETT PARTRIDGE.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.303

18:21.230 --> 18:22.405

18:28.063 --> 18:30.021
HE'S ALL YOURS.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.545
GIVE ME YOUR KNIFE.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.771
THEY DRESS 'EM
BEFORE WE BURN 'EM.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.164
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.385
[tearing plastic]

18:58.441 --> 18:59.747
[Lisbon] CHO SENT A PICTURE.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.581
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

19:07.581 --> 19:09.104
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

19:12.412 --> 19:13.543
[sighs]

19:15.980 --> 19:17.939
WHAT HAPPENED WITH SMITH?

19:17.939 --> 19:20.289
THEY ALMOST GOT HIM
AT HIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.073
THAT CBI TEAM SHOWED UP.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.814
SMITH'S IN THE WIND.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.642
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.949
[inhales sharply] I'VE GOT
SOME BUSINESS IN HERE,

19:27.949 --> 19:29.342
SO WAIT FOR ME.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.483
AH. THANK YOU, MR. THOMAS.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.919
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR A WHILE.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.660
YEAH. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

[closes door]

20:34.798 --> 20:36.191
[clicks switch]

20:38.062 --> 20:39.803
SMITH COULD BE ANYWHERE
BY NOW.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.675
I TRIED TO TRACE THE G.P.S.
SIGNAL ON HIS CELL PHONE.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.372
IT'S BEEN DEAD FOR HOURS.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.548
A DIRTY F.B.I. AGENT LIKE HIM
HAS TO HAVE A BURNER.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.898
DR. LAVROV SAYS HE DIDN'T
GET THE CHANCE TO SEW SMITH UP.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.509
HE'S STILL WALKING AROUND
WITH A BULLET WOUND.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.988
SO HE'S IN A BAD WAY
WHEREVER HE IS.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.860
HE'LL GET PICKED UP
BY SOMEONE EVENTUALLY.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.601
YEAH, BUT ANY COP
WHO FINDS HIM...

21:03.000 --> 21:05.916
THIS IS SCARY.
WE CAN'T TRUST ANYONE.

CALL CHO. HE SHOULD BE CLOSE.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.887
OKAY, WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.411
[speaks indistinctly]

22:10.154 --> 22:12.505
SMITH REACHED OUT TO CBI.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.071
HE USED THE BURNER
THE ASSOCIATION GAVE HIM.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.246
WE WERE LISTENING.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.857
HE'S TURNING HIMSELF IN.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.424
YEAH. RAT.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.164
THAT CBI TEAM IS ON ITS WAY
TO GET HIM NOW.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.862
WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
WHERE IS HE?

22:21.862 --> 22:24.778
HE'S IN AN ALLEY NOT TOO FAR
FROM HERE. OUR GOOD LUCK.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.257
DOES HE KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

22:26.257 --> 22:27.607
NAH, HE DIDN'T SEE ME
AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

22:27.607 --> 22:30.305
ALL RIGHT. YOU ARE NOW
A CBI AGENT.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.222
YOU WANT TO COME ALONG?
COULD BE FUN.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.311

22:36.311 --> 22:38.052
WE'LL MEET UP LATER.YOU GOT IT.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.836
CAN YOU GET IT RIGHT
THIS TIME?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.814
AAH!

24:07.228 --> 24:09.056

24:09.056 --> 24:12.146
[breathing unevenly]
GOD...

24:12.146 --> 24:13.800
BACK OF THE CAR NOW.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.506
[alarm chirps]

24:31.644 --> 24:35.038
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK YOU
COULD GET AWAY FROM US, DID YOU?

24:38.128 --> 24:40.391
YOU'RE A BIG BOY.
DO ME A FAVOR

24:40.391 --> 24:42.481
AND GET IN THE TRUNK

24:42.481 --> 24:44.395

25:19.648 --> 25:22.216
GET UP OFF YOUR ASS

25:22.216 --> 25:23.696
BUT, HEY, GOOD LUCK
GETTING OUT OF THE BUILDING

25:23.696 --> 25:25.611
BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS
CATCH UP WITH YOU.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.700
IF YOU TELL US
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW,

25:27.700 --> 25:30.050
I PROMISE WE WILL PUT YOU

25:30.050 --> 25:32.356
FAR AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.620
SOMEPLACE
THAT YOU'LL BE SAFE.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.234
[exhales and clicks tongue]

25:40.234 --> 25:42.018
[inhales deeply]

25:42.018 --> 25:45.195
FIVE YEARS AGO,
I HURT MY BACK. [exhales]

25:45.195 --> 25:48.634
I WAS HELPING MY COUSIN
MOVE A STUPID COUCH.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.374
DOCTOR GAVE ME
SOME PAIN PILLS.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.202
TURNS OUT I LIKED THEM.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.161
I GOT HOOKED BEFORE I EVEN KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.032
SO?

25:56.032 --> 25:58.600
SO...

25:58.600 --> 26:00.515
I'M CHASING A GANGBANGER
DOWN AN ALLEY

26:00.515 --> 26:02.909
IN CARSON SPRINGS,
AND I'M OUT OF IT.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.781
I MEAN, WAY OUT OF IT.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.044
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT I WAS
BEING FOLLOWED.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.485
I SHOT A LITTLE GIRL.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.880
A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.710
LOCAL COPS TOOK MY BLOOD.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.408
THEY HAD WITNESSES.
THEY HAD ME COLD.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.497
AND THEN THIS DETECTIVE,

26:26.497 --> 26:28.674
HE REACHES OUT TO ME
AND HE SAYS

26:28.674 --> 26:30.719
THEY CAN MAKE IT ALL
GO AWAY.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.025
AND THEY DID.

26:32.025 --> 26:35.028
THE BLOOD TESTS,
THE WITNESSES--ALL OF IT?

26:35.028 --> 26:38.248
[scoffs] HELL, WHEN THEY
GOT DONE FIXING IT,

26:38.248 --> 26:40.642
THE F.B.I. GAVE ME A MEDAL.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.646
AND EXACTLY WHO ARE "THEY"?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.694
[inhales deeply]

26:48.694 --> 26:50.913
WE CALL OURSELVES
THE BLAKE ASSOCIATION.

26:50.913 --> 26:51.914
[exhales]

26:51.914 --> 26:53.046
WHY?

26:53.046 --> 26:54.613
[inhales]"TIGER, TIGER."

26:56.615 --> 26:59.139
"TYGER, TYGER BURNING BRIGHT."

27:00.357 --> 27:01.837
FROM THE POEM BY BLAKE.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.102
SOMEONE'S A BIG FAN OF HIS,
I GUESS.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.756
WELL, WHO ELSE
IS IN THE ASSOCIATION?

27:07.756 --> 27:10.237
COPS, JUDGES, F.B.I. AGENTS.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.022
ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT
NEEDS A SECRET COVERED UP.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.328
LIKE YOUR DRUG HABIT.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.114
[sniffs] YOU NEED A FAVOR,
YOU ASK FOR IT.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.942
YOU GET ASKED TO DO SOMETHING,
YOU DO IT.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.552
"TIGER, TIGER."

27:21.552 --> 27:23.554
YEP.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.340
WELL, IS THERE SOMEBODY
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.473
MUST BE.

27:29.473 --> 27:30.910
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO.

27:30.910 --> 27:34.261
I JUST KNOW MY LITTLE GROUP.
THAT'S IT.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.177
BUT I'M GUESSING

27:37.177 --> 27:39.483
THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF US,
MAYBE THOUSANDS.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.050
AND NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT?

27:43.139 --> 27:45.707
BOB KIRKLAND KNEW ABOUT IT,
DIDN'T HE?

27:46.839 --> 27:48.275
[huffs]

27:48.275 --> 27:51.757
GO AHEAD, JUST SAY IT.
UNBURDEN YOURSELF.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.674
YEAH.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.153
HE KNEW TOO MUCH.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.810
SO I KILLED HIM.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.290
DO YOU KNOW THAT RED JOHN'S
A MEMBER

28:03.290 --> 28:04.813
OF THE BLAKE ASSOCIATION?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.989
[sighs]

28:15.998 --> 28:17.434
ARE YOU SURE?

28:17.434 --> 28:20.524
[smacks lips]
RED JOHN HAD A FOLLOWER.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.483
REBECCA ANDERSON.

28:22.483 --> 28:25.355
KILLED SOME OF YOUR GUYS
ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.357
[Lisbon] YEAH, SAM BOSCO
AND HIS TEAM.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.490
[Smith] THEM.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.753
SOMEONE ASKED ME TO GET
F.B.I. CREDENTIALS

28:31.753 --> 28:34.016
SO THAT THEY COULD ACCESS CBI.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.760
RED JOHN OR SOMEONE
WHO WORKED FOR HIM

28:38.760 --> 28:41.981
SNUCK INTO THE CBI
AND POISONED REBECCA.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.852
AND YOU HELPED THEM?

28:43.852 --> 28:46.289
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

28:46.289 --> 28:49.553
I'D--I'D DONE A FAVOR
FOR A SERIAL KILLER.

28:49.553 --> 28:53.035
WHO ASKED YOU TO GET
THE CREDENTIALS?

28:53.035 --> 28:54.863
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A PHONE CALL.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.822
THAT'S THE WAY
THE ASSOCIATION WORKS.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.214
YOU NEVER KNOW.

28:58.214 --> 29:02.218
[creaking]

29:02.218 --> 29:04.743
[gasps softly] YOU...

29:04.743 --> 29:06.353
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP ME SAFE, RIGHT?

29:06.353 --> 29:07.571
THAT DEPENDS.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.792
DID YOU MURDER
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER?

29:13.490 --> 29:15.275
[breathes sharply]

29:15.275 --> 29:18.104
I DID NOT MURDER
YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.629
I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.594
[indistinct conversations]

29:30.594 --> 29:32.422
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

29:32.422 --> 29:34.120
HE CONFESSED TO MURDER.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.339
RED JOHN WOULD NEVER BREAK
LIKE THAT, NOT EVEN AS AN ACT.

29:36.339 --> 29:39.255
WELL, IF SMITH ISN'T
RED JOHN...THAT MEANS WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.562
AND WE NEED HELP. WHO TOOK
OVER FROM BRENDA SHETTRICK?

29:41.562 --> 29:43.782
IN MEDIA RELATIONS? WHY?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.958
[camera shutters clicking]THANK YOU FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.525
WE HAVE CBI CONSULTANT
PATRICK JANE HERE,

29:48.525 --> 29:50.223
WHO IS HERE TO REPORT
A DEVELOPMENT

29:50.223 --> 29:51.659

29:51.659 --> 29:53.269
[clicking continues]

29:53.269 --> 29:55.445
THANK YOU.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.186
TEN YEARS AGO,

29:57.186 --> 29:59.493
THE SERIAL KILLER
KNOWN AS RED JOHN

29:59.493 --> 30:01.147
KILLED MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

30:01.147 --> 30:05.281
UH, WE'VE BEEN HUNTING HIM
DILIGENTLY EVER SINCE.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.283
TODAY WE'RE PLEASED
TO ANNOUNCE

30:07.283 --> 30:11.505
THAT WE--WE FINALLY HAVE
A NAME, A FACE.

30:11.505 --> 30:14.290
THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT,

30:14.290 --> 30:16.292
GAIL BERTRAM, IS RED JOHN.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.990
[clicking continues]

30:17.990 --> 30:19.643
HE'S ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

30:19.643 --> 30:22.733
IF YOU SEE HIM,
DO NOT APPROACH HIM.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.954
CALL THE CALIFORNIA
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AT ONCE.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.477
THANK YOU.

30:27.477 --> 30:31.307
[reporters shouting questions]

30:31.307 --> 30:35.094
[shouting continues]

30:35.094 --> 30:37.139
ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.457
SO ARE WE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS?

30:50.457 --> 30:52.154
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

30:52.154 --> 30:53.808
BERTRAM IS RED JOHN.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.766
LOOKS LIKE.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.595
AND IF JANE FINDS HIM,
HE'S GONNA KILL HIM.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.597
YEAH.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.122
AND WE'RE GOOD WITH THAT?
KILLING THE BOSS?

31:03.122 --> 31:04.384
I AM.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.646
YEAH.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.474
[huffs] OKAY.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.432
JUST AS LONG AS WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.999
[sighs]IT'S JUST WEIRD, IS ALL.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.530
[grunts]

31:20.530 --> 31:22.271
DOES BERTRAM SMOKE?

31:22.271 --> 31:23.838
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.927
PEOPLE GET THEM
AS GIFTS SOMETIMES.

31:25.927 --> 31:26.972
[blows air]

31:26.972 --> 31:29.670
[flicks top, spins wheel]

31:34.196 --> 31:36.111
VAN PELT.HMM?

31:39.114 --> 31:41.987
HMM. A FLASH DRIVE.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.684
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.512
THERE'S ONLY ONE FILE
ON THE DRIVE.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.817
IT'S PASSWORD-PROTECTED.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.384
I'LL HAVE TO BRUTE-FORCE IT.

31:48.384 --> 31:51.257
COOL. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO USE
MY NEW F.P.G.A.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.693
YOUR WHAT?

31:52.693 --> 31:55.043
[lowered voice] TRUST ME,
DON'T ASK. [sighs]

31:56.479 --> 31:59.743
AND...

31:59.743 --> 32:02.181
WE'RE IN.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.228
[sighs] CRAP.

32:06.228 --> 32:07.621
IT LOOKS LIKE A LIST.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.884
NAMES, MAYBE?
CAN YOU DECODE IT?

32:09.884 --> 32:11.538
I CAN TRY A FEW THINGS...[taps key]

32:11.538 --> 32:13.235
BUT DECODING IS JANE'S
DEPARTMENT.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.541
I'LL SEND IT TO HIM.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.978
[typing]

32:19.067 --> 32:22.418
HERE YOU GO.
THIS ONE ISN'T MESSING AROUND.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.854
LOTS OF PEAT.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.814
[sniffs]

32:26.814 --> 32:29.469
[TV playing inaudibly]

32:29.469 --> 32:31.601
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
CAN YOU PUT SOME ROCKS IN IT?

32:31.601 --> 32:33.690
ARE YOU SURE?
THIS IS SOME FINE SCOTCH.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.303
YEAH, I'M SURE.

32:38.347 --> 32:41.568
[scoops ice, cubes rattle]

32:52.622 --> 32:54.711
[TV playing inaudibly]

32:55.756 --> 32:57.323

33:14.122 --> 33:26.047
[exhales]

33:26.047 --> 33:28.049
I NEED A RIDE.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.094
[snaps phone shut]

33:30.921 --> 33:33.185
[horn honks]

33:34.925 --> 33:36.318
WE'RE EN ROUTE
TO THE BAR NOW.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.016
HIGHWAY PATROL
SHUT DOWN THE FREEWAYS,

33:38.016 --> 33:40.496
SO IF HE RUNS, WE'VE GOT HIM,
BUT WHAT IF HE HIDES?

33:40.496 --> 33:42.846
BERTRAM KILLED THE BARTENDER
IN CITRUS HEIGHTS.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.152
HE'S GOT AN AUNT
WITH A HOUSE THERE.

33:44.152 --> 33:45.893
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHERE HE IS?

33:45.893 --> 33:47.721
SHE MOVED INTO A RETIREMENT
HOME ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,

33:47.721 --> 33:49.331
SO HER PLACE IS EMPTY NOW.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.507
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLACE
TO HIDE. WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

33:51.507 --> 33:53.553
1408 ROSEMARY STREET.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.555
WE'RE ON OUR WAY. GET CHO
AND R.R.T. THERE NOW,

33:55.555 --> 33:56.817
AND LET THE CHOPPERS KNOW.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.601
[tires screeching]

34:01.430 --> 34:05.043
[sirens wailing]

34:06.609 --> 34:10.831
[indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter]

34:13.181 --> 34:15.053
IS HE HERE?[Cho] HE'S IN THERE.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.445
I GOT KARL AND A FEW GUYS
IN THE BACK.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.056
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.DO WE TRUST THEM?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.058
I ASKED TO SEE THEIR SHOULDERS
AND THEIR TATTOOS.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.886
[police radio chatter
continues]

34:22.886 --> 34:26.194
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I DIDN'T CALL SAC P.D. S.W.A.T.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.543
WELL, SOMEONE ASKED FOR US.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.197
LET'S SET UP A COMMAND
CENTER RIGHT HERE!

34:29.197 --> 34:32.200
LISTEN, EVERYBODY,

34:32.200 --> 34:33.680
[man] WHO AUTHORIZED THAT?
WE'RE PRIMARY ON THE SCENE.[Lisbon] THEY CAME
FROM NORTHERN DISTRICT.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.551
THAT'S WAY ACROSS TOWN.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

34:35.551 --> 34:38.685
HE DID IT.
HE CALLED THEM IN.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.383
WELL, WHY WOULD BERTRAM CALL
S.W.A.T. TO HIS OWN LOCATION?

34:41.383 --> 34:43.037
HE DIDN'T CALL IN
ONE S.W.A.T. TEAM.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.213
HE CALLED ALL OF THEM IN.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.823
THIS IS A MADHOUSE.

34:46.823 --> 34:48.521
THERE'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER UNIT
SETTING UP OUT BACK.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.913
WE'VE LOST CONTROL
OF THE SCENE, BOSS.

34:49.913 --> 34:52.742
HE'S ONE OF THEM.
BERTRAM IS ONE OF THEM.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.831
HE'S GETTING AWAY.
WE GOTTA SHUT IT DOWN.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.662
NOBODY LEAVES!

34:59.662 --> 35:01.925
NO ONE LEAVES!

35:17.724 --> 35:19.726

35:44.054 --> 35:46.883
YEAH...

35:46.883 --> 35:48.755
I NEED SOMETHING TO EAT.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.583
HOW ABOUT CHINESE?
I KNOW A GREAT PLACE.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.020
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.983
THEY FOUND BERTRAM'S CLOTHES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.724
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE PLANTED
A S.W.A.T. TEAM OUTFIT

36:01.724 --> 36:03.378
IN THE HOUSE
BEFORE HE GOT THERE.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.902
AND THEN CALLED EVERY S.W.A.T.
AND R.R.T. IN THE AREA.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.904
ANY LEADS ABOUT WHO MADE
ALL THOSE CALLS?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.471
