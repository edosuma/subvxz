00:02.070 --> 00:04.472
WOMAN: Paul's been having
a difficult time of late.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.250
FX presents Atlanta.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.522
Okay.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.257
Ooh-wee, I am fuming, y'all.

00:23.291 --> 00:27.161
So I was taking my ten-year-old,
Destiny, to school this morning.

00:27.195 --> 00:32.533
Now, she loves
that 96.5 radio station.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.836
It's like the hits
or top 40 hits or something.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.038
This rap song comes on.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.509
And it was just... disgusting.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.078
It's... You okay, baby?

00:44.112 --> 00:47.181
Want a juice box?

00:47.215 --> 00:51.051
So, uh, I-I looked up
the lyrics.

00:51.085 --> 00:55.123
And the song is by this guy,
Paper Boi,

00:55.156 --> 00:57.791
and I'm gonna read y'all
what was playing.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.294
So there's gonna be
some cussing.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.929
But it's not my words.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.064
Okay, so here it goes.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.602
"Bitch, I need reparations.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.972
"N-Niggas tired of dancing
like The Temptations.

01:12.005 --> 01:16.110
"Sell a dime bag
or that new crack, fentanyl.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.712
"The same reason Prince killed.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.282
"My dick is like a tree trunk.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.984
"Baby, catch this tree sap.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.887
"Kicked you out the condo.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.590
"This ain't the place
you sleep at.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.625
"Baby, slide on the dick.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.162
"You can do it all night.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.764
"You can be my baby mama.

01:36.797 --> 01:40.668
You can't ever be my wife."

01:40.701 --> 01:43.271
Here's where it
gets crazy, y'all.

01:43.304 --> 01:47.675
"Said no to college
'cause it's no fun.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.778
"Mo' drugs and mo' guns.

01:50.811 --> 01:54.081
"But I still might have
to slap a trick.

01:54.114 --> 01:58.051
Shout-out Colin Kaepernick."

02:00.053 --> 02:01.289
:
I'm sorry.

02:01.322 --> 02:05.493
It's just, like,
this is what was on.

02:05.526 --> 02:09.330
* Uh, told a bitch
you motherfuckin' right *

02:09.363 --> 02:11.699
* Told a bitch
you motherfuckin' right. *

02:13.867 --> 02:15.469
Hey!

02:15.503 --> 02:18.272
Oh, boy, I can't believe
that single went gold already.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.842
Yo, that white woman crying,

02:21.875 --> 02:23.777
that was the best thing that
could've happened to us, man.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.214
Their tears are powerful.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.781
They are. They really are.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.049
Yo, I was gonna send her ass
a gift,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.051
but, uh,
she was slick hatin', though.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.123
Oh, man. Hey, y'all fellas
want another round of shots?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.658
-Oh, hell yeah, man.
-Yeah. -Sure, man.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.293
BARTENDER:
1800-- it's on me.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.128
Not even gonna charge y'all
for these, all right?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.896
-Oh, thanks, man.
-Thanks.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.967
Matter of fact,
might take one with y'all.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.870
-Oh, all right.
-Oh... -Hey...

02:49.903 --> 02:52.072
White tears.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.641
Oh, it tastes like free.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.075
Ah.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.845
Look, we got to talk about...

02:57.878 --> 03:01.849
Yo. Y

03:01.882 --> 03:04.151
Yeah, man.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.719
Man, see, listen,
I was trying to see

03:05.753 --> 03:07.020
if I could kick some business
with you, brother.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.489
Like, I got a handle
on a couple...

03:08.522 --> 03:10.424
Well, actually, you know, we're
kind of off the clock right now,

03:10.458 --> 03:12.159
-so, like, we're just...
-Man, fuck you, dude!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.262
I'm talking to Paper Boi.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.365
Okey-dokey.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.433
BARTENDER:
Anyway, man, so...

03:19.467 --> 03:21.101
put me on.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.870
Huh?

03:22.903 --> 03:27.508
Put... me... on.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.877
I'm trying to get like you,
you know.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.679
-I need this shit.
-MAN: Order up. Let's go, now.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.548
Yes, sir, it'll be right up.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.188
Okay, that was... weird.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.525
Man, that shit be happening
all the time now, man.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.927
It's kind of cool.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.429
You know?
'Cause people recognize you.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.897
ALFRED:
Yeah, man, that's overrated.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.098
Nah. I don't think it is
'cause, like,

03:51.131 --> 03:52.866
I'm always getting stunted on.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.135
I would love to be the person
who can stunt on somebody.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.304
You can stunt on anybody
you want.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.071
Hey, man, shit.
Look, welcome to Atlanta.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.440
Man, all you need is some money.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.208
I don't even think it's that.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.312
I once bought a homeless person
a McDonald's meal.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.779
He threw it away
right in front of me.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.147
Stunted on right there.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.549
ALFRED:
Look, trust me, man.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.551
This town run off
stunting on people.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.252
Them streaming checks
come in yet?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.455
-Monday.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.056
It's gonna be less
than you expected,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.658
but more than I was, so...

04:17.691 --> 04:19.993
Oh. Coolio 'cause I need
that money, yo.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.495
I feel you.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.432
I feel... I feel everything.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.636
-* Where tiny men
have been absorbed... *

04:29.703 --> 04:31.672
VAN:
Hey, babe.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.843
EARN:
Hey. What's up?

04:35.876 --> 04:40.013
Mm. I love how you send all
your important mail to my house.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.616
Yeah. That's love. I trust you.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.787
You're not gonna believe
what happened today.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.188
What happened today?

04:48.221 --> 04:49.657
VAN:
You know how we've been trying

04:49.690 --> 04:51.492
to go to this BeyoncÃ© concert?

04:51.525 --> 04:54.662
This heifer Kristina goes out
and buys herself a VIP ticket.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.865
* She asked me who died... *

04:57.898 --> 05:00.033
That means
we can't sit together.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.602
And not everybody can afford

05:01.635 --> 05:04.137
350 extra dollars
for a fucking VIP ticket.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.808
And she's like, "Well, maybe
I can meet all y'all afterwards.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.310
Maybe."

05:12.312 --> 05:13.881
She stunted on you.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.784
She stunted on me.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.619
Well, you know what?
This weekend...

05:18.652 --> 05:19.887
Mm-hmm.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.623
...we're doing it big.
I'm calling it.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.024
-No more Mr. Nice Earn.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.393
-Yeah, seriously.
-Okay, Diddy.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.027
The stunters have become
the stunted.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.562
-All right, all right.
-Yeah.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.364
-Puff Daddy.
-Look at this.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.666
Puff Zaddy.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.636
-Oh.
-Yeah.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.538
-Shit.
-Oh, my God.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.240
-You're gonna get us robbed.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.515
Hey, what up, boy?

05:47.548 --> 05:48.882
-Hey! Paper Boi in the house.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.684

05:58.091 --> 05:59.593
CLARK: Yo, that's my boy, Boogz,

06:09.069 --> 06:10.771
Yo, Tub dubs.
My mom, she used to work

06:10.804 --> 06:12.372

06:12.406 --> 06:14.742
Yeah, she got 'em to me
before they stopped making 'em,

06:14.775 --> 06:17.945
-so, kind of like
a little good luck charm. -Wow.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.613
CLARK:
Yeah, man.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.381
But, yo, we're working

We could get a couple verses in.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.387
Come on, man. We might as well.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.389
Oh, yeah, man. Well, I got

CLARK:
Nah, I feel you, totally, bro...

06:32.993 --> 06:35.262
Yeah, I rolled a blunt, man.
You

06:35.295 --> 06:36.697
CLARK:
Man, that sounds dope,

06:36.730 --> 06:38.365
but I don't,
I don't really smoke.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.233
-Nah, I got to keep
my voice right.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.234
But, hey, thanks, man.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.103
Yeah, man, I-I hear you.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.938
All right, well, that's why
I brought this Hen, though.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.373
-DARIUS: Yeah, boy.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.708
You trying to get in on this,
I know, right?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.810
Man! You brought the Hen,
that's dope!

06:49.843 --> 06:51.612
I know you trying

06:51.645 --> 06:53.714
Hey, that's what's up, man.
I don't really drink.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.716
We got bottles here for y'all,
though.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.084
But I don't really drink

06:57.117 --> 07:00.087
-That's lit, though, man.
-Yeah. Okay.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.255
Yeah, man, yo.
Do your thing, man.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.558
Get in your zone. I'm about

Play that one.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.764
Yo, Clark is pretty cool, man.

Yeah, I know.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.670

07:16.704 --> 07:18.138
-ENGINEER: Okay, got you, bro.
-Yeah, track get me hype.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.453
Yo.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.001
* Yo, I just bought a dinosaur

07:48.035 --> 07:50.003
-Uh...

07:50.037 --> 07:51.539
Hey, what happened?
Hey, what's going on?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.040
ENGINEER:
Hey, sorry, man.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.341
The program just crashed
or something.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.144
CLARK:
The program just crashed?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.346
ENGINEER: I just got to up...
we got to update, probably.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.114
-Okay.
-ENGINEER: I'm sorry, man.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.884
It just...
yeah, it just crashed.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.886
Dude, don't crash it again,
dude.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.487
ENGINEER:
Yeah, that's my bad.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.289
-CLARK: Yeah, it's your bad.
-It just crashed, so...

08:09.322 --> 08:11.291
Dude, if it crashes again,

08:11.324 --> 08:14.695
I'm gonna crash my foot
in your ass.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.630
Fix that shit, okay?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.566
ENGINEER: Yeah, that's-that's
my bad. You know...

08:18.599 --> 08:20.568
Hey, yo, Al, man.
You fucks with that, man?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.469
-Dude, that was...
-That shit was dope to me, man.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.371
Boy, you're
a strapping young lad.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.039
-It's good, man. -CLARK: Hey,
man. I appreciate you, Darius.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.140
You got that, man.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.542
Yo, it's the gift, bro.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.678
Like, I was just freestyling
off the top, right?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.713
And then I just got
into this different world, man.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.848
I don't even remember
what I said, to be real, man.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.483
I felt that, man.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.652
Hopefully, I can
recreate it, you know,

08:38.686 --> 08:42.089
um, after I listen to it because
the engineer did his job.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.757
He recorded it, right?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.225
Yeah, we got that.
I'm just double-checking

08:45.258 --> 08:46.326
-Right, right.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.428
-Yo.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.198
-You need to stop playing, dawg.
Okay? -Man, I'm not...

08:51.231 --> 08:53.333
-I'm not playing. It's...
-Hey, yo, Boogz, it's cool, man.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.336
'Cause it's all love, right?
Hey, man, I love you, bro.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.206
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'd never put a hand on you.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.608
ENGINEER:
I know that.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.342
Just don't fuck up

09:02.375 --> 09:04.612
because I'm not the only one
with hands in this world.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.746
You know what I'm saying?

09:05.779 --> 09:08.949
ENGINEER: Yeah, man.
I love you, too.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.752
-Let's do this.
-Yeah, hey, stop talking.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.256
Damn, this place
is kind of nice.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.958
Yeah, and it serves alcohol.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.392
'Cause, you know,
when you're drunk,

09:19.426 --> 09:22.462
the one thing you want to do
is sit in a chair for two hours.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.564
-Yeah, totally.
-Yeah.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.767
-Yeah, uh, can I get, uh,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.435
two tickets
for Fast and Furious?

09:28.468 --> 09:30.303
Oh, regular or VIP?

09:30.337 --> 09:34.307
-It doesn't matter. Two VIPs.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.776
-Okay.
-Yeah.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.648
I'm sorry,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.751
but I can't take
a bill that large.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.754
It's all right, um...
just use my debit.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.557
Mm-hmm. Uh, can I see an ID
or a driver's license?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.892
Thank you.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.895
Okay. I got to make a copy
of these every time we swipe it,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.097
so, um, are you good on tickets?

09:57.130 --> 10:00.300
You got to make a copy
every time you swipe?

10:00.333 --> 10:03.003
Yeah, I know it's crazy.
It's a new policy, though.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.471
Yeah, but...

10:04.504 --> 10:07.107
Yeah, I don't want a bunch
of copies of my debit card

10:07.140 --> 10:08.742
and my driver's license
all around, you know?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.010
What if somebody steals it?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.180
-We're not responsible for that.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.615
It's fine, 'cause I have cash.
I could just pay with it.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.819
No, it's fine.
Um, it's okay, we'll...

10:18.852 --> 10:21.588
We'll figure something else out.
It's fine. Thank you.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.323
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.026
Babe, it's fine. I can pay.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.262
No, it... This place feels weird
to you, right?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.131
-It feels kind of strange.
-Yeah. It's a weird policy.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.966
Yeah, yeah. And when did they
even start doing that?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.368
$32.28.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.272
What?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.875
That's a hund...
Hold on right there.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.110
Excuse me, sir.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.477
I-I know you don't know me,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.914
but I just tried to pay
with a hundred, and they told...

10:48.916 --> 10:52.585
Wow. Okay, let's-let's get out
of here. Yeah.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.689
Thanks very much.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.000
* Gray love *

11:07.034 --> 11:10.871
* Hungover Sunday love *

11:10.904 --> 11:13.206
* Come over, no, stay, love... *

11:13.240 --> 11:15.308
I told you not to use
the $100 bill.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.846
Why? It's legal U.S. tender.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.749
Nobody uses cash
like that anymore.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.817
What are you, Gucci Mane?
Come on.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.353
I should be able to use
a $100 bill, okay?

11:26.386 --> 11:27.988
What happened to us was racist.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.590
-It was weird.
-No, it was racism.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.892
-Textbook.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.862
I caught that lady red-handed.

11:34.895 --> 11:38.065
-You can't say that.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.734
Red-handed. Like, red skin.

11:40.768 --> 11:44.104
Like, Native Americans
'cause they're always stealing.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.442
I didn't even know.
I didn't even know that.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.279
-I... Damn.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.848
* Come over, no, stay, love... *

11:54.882 --> 11:56.383
You're fucking with me.
That's not funny.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.551
-That's not funny.
-It's funny.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.720
-No.
-It's funny.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.592
It sounds real.

12:09.930 --> 12:14.001
I don't think that's where
it comes from.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.939
Oh, my God.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.641
Hey, man.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.044
I see you out here getting that
endorsement money.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.479
-I need some of that shit.
-Hell yeah.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.714
That Yoo-hoo commercial.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.885
-That shit fire, boy. "Yoo-hoo!"

12:31.919 --> 12:33.653
Thanks, man.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.588
The commercials
pay really well, too.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.390
You got to get on that,
Paper Boi.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.459
Man, I don't know, man.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.829
I ain't got the image
for that shit like you do.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.263
What you mean

12:43.296 --> 12:45.598
They got him for the, uh,
what's that, the rap snack?

12:45.632 --> 12:46.666
Rap Snacks.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.168
-Aw, man.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.803
-Yeah, man.
-That-That's dope.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.105
Yeah, man, they wanted
to give me my own flavor called

12:52.139 --> 12:54.141
-Cocaine White Cheddar or some
shit, man. -There you go.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.608
-But I passed on that, man.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.477
Look, I wanted that Fast
and the Furious soundtrack,

12:57.510 --> 12:59.246
but, uh, I ain't get it.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.982
Then I found out that
your ass got it, though.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.951
Yeah, yeah. I got it. Yeah.

13:03.984 --> 13:07.754
I mean, most of these majors'
stuff, they don't...

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
They don't look out
for black folks like that.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.624
They don't put us on like that.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.326
There's only one spot
for niggas,

13:13.360 --> 13:16.763
and I got to get it,
so you know how that go.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.832
Yeah, but how you be
getting that shit, though?

13:18.866 --> 13:21.134
My manager, Luke.
He hooks it all up, man.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.271
He has all the connections
with all the major brands.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.539
He really does his job
really well, man.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.141
If you want to talk to anybody,

13:28.175 --> 13:30.543
just holler at Luke. Yeah.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.180
-Yeah. -Got some waters
for you guys. -Oh, thanks, bro.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.647
-Yeah, of course.
-I appreciate it, man.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.451
Yo, pull up the
"King of Diamonds" joint.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.453
-All right.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.222
I'm not sure.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.658
Let me know
when you're sure, okay?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.627
I'm not playing
with you today, okay?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.897
It's me and Paper Boi, man.
Come on, man, come on.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.564
-Don't waste our time, bro.
-I got you.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.334
You-you got me.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.303
How much we got, man?
Fifty thou?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.805
Ha, $50,000 on me.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.207
Who are you on the phone with?
I see you.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.308
Why you ain't bring no girls?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.043
-I was calling
my accountant, nigga. -Hey!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.347
No, it's just,
it's fucking amaz...

14:07.380 --> 14:09.082
It crashed again.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.692
Hey, yo, Boogz, I'm gonna go
for a walk real quick,

14:19.726 --> 14:22.562
all right, man?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.209
Y'all should go home.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.851
-Yeah, man.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.520
I was on my way out anyway,
you know what I mean.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.958
-Good luck with your track, bro.
-Thanks, man.

14:50.991 --> 14:54.561
-Appreciate it. Yep.
-Stay woke.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.964
I'm gonna just take this, man,
'cause it's, like, half full.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.698
-Oh, yeah, I-I got it, man.
-Yep, you got this.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.699
We got it, we got it.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.905
If you break it down, hookah
kind of sounds like something

15:05.939 --> 15:08.208
the tobacco industry
created for six-year-olds.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.944
You know what I'm saying?
Like... fruit-flavored smoke.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.281
You're not supposed to
breathe it in, you know that?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.582
-Thank you.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.652
-No, Grandpa.
-Now I really hate it.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.888
I got to pat you down, bro.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.356
Sure, yeah. All right.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.598
You're good, you're good, bro.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.267
$20 for dudes, bro.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.769
All right. $20?

15:36.803 --> 15:37.937
$20 for dudes, bro.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.242
There, you have
a good night, man.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.477
-Thanks.
-Picture ID.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.181
See?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.317
You're not gonna tell me
it's not cute.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.486
I thought I'd see more
Middle Eastern people here.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.621
It's kind of weird.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.323
Thank you.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.858
Okay, so, which flavor
do you like?

15:58.891 --> 16:01.528
'Cause mint is good,
but you can mix them.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.962
I'm not really a mint guy.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.465
-I don't like how it feels
in my mouth. -Oh, my God.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.666
Especially with smoke...

16:06.699 --> 16:08.668
You have the palate
of a three-year-old.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.370
Untrue. I...

16:10.403 --> 16:14.007
Sir, did you just pay
with that $100 bill outside?

16:14.041 --> 16:16.609
Uh... yeah?

16:16.643 --> 16:19.146
Well, that $100 bill was fake.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.881
-You need to come with us.
What do you mean?

16:21.914 --> 16:25.485
That bill you used was fake.
Let's go.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.354
Are you sure it was mine?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.789
You're the only one
who's paid with a $100 bill.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.991
-Let's just go.
-All right.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.461
You see? Right there.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.329
There's the watermark.

16:36.363 --> 16:40.533
No, no. You did that.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.535
I did that?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.204
What do you...?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.174
No, man-- just-just get another
hundred to compare it.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.142
There are no other hundreds
in the bar.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.643
Do you got one of those...

16:50.677 --> 16:52.745
one of those pens
that you can mark it with?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.581
Of course not.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.417
How do you even know it's fake?

16:57.450 --> 16:58.551
I know, okay?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.987
Here. Try and rip it up.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.755
What?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.424
What are you talking about?
That makes no sense.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.459
I'm not falling for your tricks.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.931
You know what?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.000
It's fine. Just...
Just give me the...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.002
Give me the money back.
I-I'll leave.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.904
Yeah, but you
already came inside.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.772
You still need to pay.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.410
Hurry up!

17:23.443 --> 17:26.213
Oh, my fucking God.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.955
Hey.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.624
We all know
that the bill was real,

17:37.657 --> 17:40.893
but the owner was tripping.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.929
Sorry about that.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.402
That was definitely racist.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.937
Yeah, what the fuck?
This is supposed to be

17:50.970 --> 17:52.905
a celebration, man.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.974
Yeah, I know.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.309
Let's just get some food.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.444
No, no, no.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.878
I know where we're going.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.747
Where we gonna go?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.116
I'm going somewhere
where people definitely know

18:03.150 --> 18:05.885
how to treat someone with money.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.755
Yeah. A'ight, a'ight.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.257
A'ight, man. Bet.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.991
Hey, man.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.326
Earn headed to the strip club.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.061
You want to go slap some butts?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.330
Nah, but I'll watch.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.065
Huh-- all right.
Get dressed, nigga.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.400
Earn trying to stunt tonight.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.634
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That reminds me.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.470
I got this brand-new
all-white suit.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.805
On a bitch.
I'm-a throw that on.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.475
You really want to wear all
white to a strip club, nigga?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.477
You're right.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.078
Tracy, you coming?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.313
Yeah.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.648
I'm ready.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.590
Yeah, that's funny,
you know that we don't...

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
-Goddamn!

18:45.658 --> 18:47.427
-No.
-That thing clean.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.661
What y'all do, rob a prom?

18:48.695 --> 18:50.930
Paper Boi, Paper Boi!

18:50.963 --> 18:52.031
Hey, Vanessa.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.866
-Hi, Alfred.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.001
Y'all niggas is drunk.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.369
Do you like my big car?

18:56.403 --> 18:58.004
I-I don't want
to respond to that.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.606
-That's weird.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.509
Thank you for shuttling
us black people to Onyx.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.377
-No,
this shit's gonna be tight, man.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.478
Y'all stunting tonight.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.046
We stunting tonight. Yeah.

You just took $200

Okay, honey, that'll be $20.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.348
-That wasn't even three seconds.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.049
You-you didn't even
make it over there.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.285
-Well, it's for a song.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.153
Uh, we still haven't gotten
our tequila.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.955
Yeah, I was waiting
on you guys to pay for it.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.291
But it comes with the table.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.194
Yeah, it comes with the table,
so you have to buy one.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.396

But she's so skinny, and she...

22:25.712 --> 22:27.547
-she's not doing anything.
: I know.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.082
But I feel bad for her.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.651
She seems new, and, like,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.085
all the other girls
are so pretty,

22:33.119 --> 22:35.054
and she shouldn't have
to compete.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.923
All right.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.190
You got it.
Pity dance.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.360
I've never heard of that.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.430
ALFRED :
"She looks new."

22:43.463 --> 22:45.364
Man, that's Minnie.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.233
Looking new her hook.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.736
Yeah, she's been looking new for
about damn ten years now, man.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.305
-Mm-hmm.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.678
Yeah, well...
it's working for her.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.846
Hmm.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.414
Hey, man.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.382
Van told me about
that $100 bill shit.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.284
Yeah, that shit was wack.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.887
Yeah, well, you can't be going
out spending $100 bills, nigga.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.955
Why not?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.458
It's legal U.S. tender.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.859
Look at you, man.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.226
You don't look like
no damn dope boy.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.862
I'd think that shit
was fake, too.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.764
-You told me
the only thing I needed

23:17.797 --> 23:19.899
-to run this city was money.
-Mm-mmm.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.268
Money is an idea, man.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.871
Look, there's a reason that a
white dude dressed just like you

23:24.904 --> 23:26.372
can walk into a bank
and get a loan,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.775
and you can't even spend
a $100 bill, man.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.977
I mean, you need to start
acting like you're better

23:31.010 --> 23:32.979
than other niggas, and then
they'll start treating you

23:33.012 --> 23:34.947
-better than other niggas.
-DARIUS: Yeah, 'cause otherwise,

23:34.981 --> 23:36.215
-you're just another nigga.
-Another nigga.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.617
-Mm-hmm.

Yo, man. We should hire her, yo.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.058
Hey!
-There it is!

23:48.160 --> 23:49.729
I don't even know why I'm here.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.930
This place has been
finessing me all night.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.632
ALFRED:
Duh, nigga.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.567
It's a strip club.
That's what it's for.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.735
Yep. It ain't like
you're supposed to be

23:55.768 --> 23:57.336

25:04.270 --> 25:06.305
No, what, wait...

25:06.338 --> 25:08.507
Sometimes you just got
to stunt on people.

25:08.541 --> 25:11.177
And also, I haven't run
six races in ten minutes.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.378
