WEBVTT

00:02.628 --> 00:05.338
I'm gonna tickle you!

00:12.137 --> 00:13.680
I need a refill.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.475
- You've already had three.
- So what? They're free.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.560
I got a birthday.
Get it yourself.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.854
No wonder he doesn't
get any tips.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.147
All right.

00:23.273 --> 00:27.610
Who's ready to sing the Ralphie's Rumpus
birthday rump shake?

00:31.573 --> 00:35.201
Let's sing, let's ride,
let's bling, let's slide

00:35.327 --> 00:38.705
It's time for Ralphie

00:38.831 --> 00:42.291
We'll dance, eat cake
and do the rump shake

00:42.418 --> 00:44.877
It's time for Ralphie

00:45.003 --> 00:45.962
You okay, man?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.178
You okay?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.945
Okay. All right.
Let's get you in the back.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.072
It's gonna be okay,
kids. Sorry.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.834
Got a heartbeat.
Jack? Jack?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.544
- I need you to step back.
- He's my brother.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.421
- Jack, wake up!
- Call your parents.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.339
Tell them to go to
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

01:30.466 --> 01:33.634
Our parents died.
He's all we've got.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.467
I was not parked illegally.
I live here.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.969
Love note.
From Detective Tritter.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.266
Heart attack.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.478
His cath was clean and echo
showed no structural abnormalities.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.648
Fatigue, night sweats,
weight loss preceded the heart attack.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.526
Eighteen-year-old kid's suddenly
an orphan and a single father of two.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.111
Party of Five.
Powerful stuff.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.030
The O.C. of its day.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.951
Stress explains everything
except the itchy feet.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.327
Athlete's foot covers that.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.871
Waiters work 12 hours
a day in old sneakers.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.958
Good idea. Ignore the symptoms.
Makes our job easy.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.710
I'm not ignoring a symptom.
I'm explaining a symptom.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.964
Kid's been hanging over a toilet
despite antiemetic therapy.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.382
Persistent vomiting
could indicate

02:54.508 --> 02:56.300
increased intracranial
pressure, tumor...

02:56.426 --> 02:59.095
Sure. Heart problems.
It's gotta be the brain.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.180
Thank God
there's a neurologist in the room.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.350
Right. It's the feet.
If only I were a podiatrist.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.979
Probably caught an intestinal virus from
one of those feral kids running around.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.523
Repeated vomiting causes
an electrolyte imbalance,

03:10.649 --> 03:13.568
which leads to an arrhythmia,
which leads to the heart attack.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.028
- And itchy feet.
- Nope.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.283
- That's it? Nope?
- I've said too much already.

03:20.409 --> 03:24.453
- This isn't a game, House.
- No, it's not. But it could be.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.999
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.625
If you know the diagnosis,
why don't...

03:29.751 --> 03:31.168
How are you gonna
learn to swim

03:31.295 --> 03:34.755
unless I take off your floaties and
throw you into shark-infested waters?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.466
You can't know what's wrong
after a 30-second perusal of his file.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.803
Apparently, you can't.
Now, what's a game without rules?

03:40.929 --> 03:45.558
No tag-backs. No biting.
You get one test each.

03:45.684 --> 03:50.605
And the clock runs until lunch.
If I'm right, he'll still be alive.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.316
If I'm wrong,
this is a very cruel game.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.235
You're late.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.195
I charge for the time
you were supposed to be here.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.031
Tritter towed my car.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.491
He's frozen my assets.
He's on a crusade.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.453
You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.163
You're linked to their suspect
and his activities.

04:07.289 --> 04:11.626
I'm not Pablo Escobar's evil henchman
cruising into Miami in a Cigarette boat.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.128
I'm a physician who prescribed Vicodin
to a pain patient.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.840
This police report you faxed me says
they found 600 pills in his apartment.

04:17.966 --> 04:18.925
You prescribe those?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.969
He's in chronic pain.
This is obviously an abuse of power.

04:22.095 --> 04:22.970
Is that a yes or no?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.348
Patients build up
a tolerance over the years.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.975
Perfect motive for him
to forge those scrips.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.560
Still don't have an answer.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.520
- What are we, like, role-playing?
- Yeah.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.897
And you suck at it.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.525
Which is really unfortunate,
because you're pretending to be you.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.277
I gotta get to court.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.071
Michael told me
you could help me get my car back.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.574
Yeah, divorce lawyers usually know
the ins and outs of drug enforcement.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.742
You want your car back?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.369
You're gonna have to
give the cops what they want.

04:46.495 --> 04:50.414
Thanks. Usually people feel helpless
in these situations.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.000
Dr. House is
probably going to jail.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.670
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along with him.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.716
House was on this page when he got that
annoying "I'm such a genius" look.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.218
- What's there?
- Patient history.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.262
He's 18. Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.390
How close am I?

05:07.516 --> 05:10.935
Quit drugs when his parents died.
Quit smoking.

05:12.604 --> 05:16.232
House didn't mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.025
Which means he didn't want to
give reasons.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.319
Which means
I must have been close.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.030
I'm thinking bacterial.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.657
I'm doing a blood culture.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.243
I am doing an MRI.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.911
If it was a tumor, intracranial pressure

05:29.037 --> 05:30.871
could cause his brain to herniate
before lunch.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.248
Same thing with
the stress test.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.084
- Which is why I'm ditching it.
- What are you doing instead?

05:35.210 --> 05:36.127
Not telling.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.087
Seriously?
You're playing his game?

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.050
Anybody else sick at work?

05:44.136 --> 05:46.595
I had a stomachache
before him.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.848
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.558
My brother's in the hospital.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.269
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.813
Your brother cares
if you finish your homework.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.578
Can I be your
imaginary friend?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.955
He's a doctor.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.458
How are the feet?
Still itch?

06:17.335 --> 06:20.463
- Is that important?
- I don't know. Is it?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.092
What kinds of drugs
you into?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.719
You don't have to
talk about that right now.

06:26.845 --> 06:27.720
No, it's okay.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.263
I don't keep secrets
from them.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.348
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

06:31.475 --> 06:35.102
Clever. Admit the past.
Deny the present.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.479
I'm clean.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.190
I'm raising two kids. It'd be
pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?

06:39.316 --> 06:41.776
But confiding in
an eight-year-old is okay.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.070
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

06:44.196 --> 06:48.032
Yeah. Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.700
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.869
They lie because
they've got something to hide.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.120
Look at him.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.456
He's sitting there
doing nothing and he's still lying.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.500
We don't lie to Jack.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.794
- Spelling test you failed and forgot...
- No.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.795
- Math test?
- No.

07:00.921 --> 07:01.879
Fight with the kid
sitting next to you?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.090
He doesn't sit next to me.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.427
And the other one's
probably having sex.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.429
- I am not.
- Yet.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.682
But when you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.820
- Colder.
- I'm not playing.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.031
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.701
How much dope did you smoke?

07:32.828 --> 07:35.746
- Does he have to be here?
- No. Ignore him.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.958
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.460
What about the cigarettes?
How'd you quit?

07:41.586 --> 07:44.088
Gum? The patch? Hypnosis?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.298
He went from two packs
to nothing, cold turkey.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.844
Or we could just
make small talk.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.804
You still seeing
that nurse in Pedes?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.514
I just don't think
she's right for you.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.476
You need someone detached,
calculating, ambitious.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.478
You need yourself in a skirt.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.689
Jack, he asked you a question.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.109
I didn't really quit.
I just sort of lost taste for it.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.487
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

08:08.613 --> 08:12.700
He's still puking, and he had
a heart attack and itchy feet.

08:12.868 --> 08:16.579
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.667
Ice cold.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.175
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

08:29.301 --> 08:32.845
was caused by a spasm in the vessels
surrounding your heart.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.223
Let me know if
anything feels... unusual.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.687
If the problems are at my heart, why
did that other doctor look at my brain?

08:41.813 --> 08:44.565
Yeah. Why did that other doctor
look at his brain?

08:45.150 --> 08:48.444
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities as we can.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.655
So because you think
that a spasm caused his heart attack,

08:51.781 --> 08:53.866
you're gonna induce
another spasm?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.242
Did you consent to this?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.286
Everything's under control.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.956
Tests are gonna identify which arteries
are affected so we can repair them.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.250
Your meds don't seem
to be doing anything.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.877
So either you're wrong,

09:05.003 --> 09:08.964
or his system hasn't
been pushed enough to set anything off.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.265
You wanna get back home,
right?

09:18.391 --> 09:22.269
I mean, you're probably already falling
behind with the housework and the bills.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.689
How many sick days you think you'll get
before they replace you?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.236
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.155
They can't fire me
if I'm sick.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.282
Right. You're irreplaceable.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.202
Who else would they find
qualified to dance with a rodent?

09:38.328 --> 09:39.828
How can you even
support your family?

09:39.955 --> 09:43.624
What happens when those kids grow out
of their clothes? When they get sick?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.042
Still no spasm.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.378
They'll take those kids
away from you, Jack.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.924
Maybe I should bring them in here right
now so that you can kiss them goodbye.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.552
Can't you see his heart is fine!
Stop torturing him!

09:55.679 --> 09:57.972
What kind of doctor are you?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.518
Wonderful.
Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.896
- You're just getting here?
- Busses suck.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.274
- Where's your car?
- It's a hostage.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.651
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.069
You're not going to.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.779
Is that a question
or an order?

10:13.905 --> 10:16.782
Any sort of conviction
will cost House his license...

10:16.908 --> 10:18.242
Which will cost
this hospital. Relax.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.202
I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.789
I told my lawyer to tell Tritter
to go to hell. Marco!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.543
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

10:27.669 --> 10:30.254
Sorry, Dr. Wilson. I was trying
to call you. Where's your phone?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.339
In my car. My patients,
on the other hand,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.049
are here and
needed their medications.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.344
I'm sorry. I can't.
Your DEA number's been suspended.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.766
Why so sad?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.811
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.732
That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.152
Blood culture was
negative for bacteria.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.112
But positive for hepatitis A?

10:55.572 --> 10:58.615
I wonder who could've ordered
that extra test.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.076
Must be somebody who knew
what persistent vomiting,

11:01.202 --> 11:03.412
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.080
Hep A doesn't explain
the heart attack.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.959
No. But as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier, puking does.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.753
And hep A
explains the puking.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.548
If this had been real life
instead of just a game...

11:16.885 --> 11:20.512
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.765
Well, who's gonna
prescribe my Vicodin?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.266
Yes, well,
that's why I'm here.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.684
This is a disaster for you.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.061
Relax.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.605
Tritter's just getting desperate.
He's got no real evidence.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.106
He's trying to
squeeze you into ratting.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.442
I'm not gonna
let him squeeze my patients.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.071
They'll be fine. Most of your
cancer medicine sucks anyway.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.699
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing

11:40.825 --> 11:43.535
until this is straightened out.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.372
Suddenly this doesn't seem
nearly as dramatic.

11:46.498 --> 11:51.251
Go pump IVIG into the kid,
cure him and get him out of here.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.713
- Hep A?
- No.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.383
"Chase, blood test
for bacteria.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.593
"Foreman, MRI,
too stubborn to check the lungs.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.303
"Cameron, nice try. No spasm."

12:04.974 --> 12:09.144
"But the princess sat
and sat and sat,

12:10.188 --> 12:12.189
"pretending not to listen."

12:13.691 --> 12:18.153
Pretending to write
in her journal with the flowers on it.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.033
Pretending she didn't like stories about
eight-year-olds who save the world.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.076
I'm 11.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.744
Which is why
you can no longer save the world.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.871
- I'm eight!
- Yeah.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.082
We're all completely
dependent on you.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.542
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.878
Good news.
We can take you off the IVIG.

12:35.004 --> 12:39.091
The hep A has cleared your system.
You'll be good to go by tomorrow.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.510
How do you think I got it?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.011
Well, it could've been
contaminated food.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.222
It could've been
from cleaning the bathrooms at work.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.391
Or it could've
been...

12:48.810 --> 12:51.019
Don't worry.
They've heard it all.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.021
Anilingus is a common way.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.023
You should just tell the people
that you've dated

12:55.150 --> 12:57.359
they should get
themselves checked.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.113
Don't worry. I've been too busy chasing
after these guys to go spelunking.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.114
You're gross.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.535
- I think.
- Does your arm hurt?

13:06.661 --> 13:07.536
Arm's fine, bro.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.664
- Then why's it bleeding?
- It's not. It's...

13:13.668 --> 13:15.919
Raise your arm
above your head.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.673
Your ear... And your nose...

13:28.892 --> 13:32.895
High PT and PTT on Jack's
blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.

13:33.438 --> 13:38.525
So, we cure the hep A,
something else pops up.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.235
Interesting.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.447
What infections cause DIC?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.325
You okay?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.620
Hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.330
Shall we discuss
what causes DIC,

13:51.456 --> 13:54.041
or should we just send the kid back
to his miserable life?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.168
- He's not miserable.
- Right.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.462
He's thrilled that his parents are dead
and his life is over.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.757
The restaurant's probably teeming
with E. coli, Eikenella and strep.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.510
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty and the party and...

14:04.636 --> 14:06.970
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool every day.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.889
And Jack's the only one
who got sick?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.974
Kid's got tattoos, piercings

14:11.100 --> 14:13.477
and probably some nasty little girl
who loaned him the hep A.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.437
Could've also given him
syphilis or gonorrhea.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.314
- I need one of you.
- Take Cameron.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.649
Your idea was dumb anyway.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.946
Chase, I need you to head back to that
cesspool and get me the kid's puke.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.741
Foreman, do an LP and have Cameron
run down that potty-party theory.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.160
Why don't I just test him?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.163
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.421
The amount of vomiting
that kid did,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.716
there wouldn't be enough toxins left
in his system to show up in his blood.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.135
And since he vomited in the toilet here
instead of on somebody,

14:47.262 --> 14:50.222
that restaurant is our only source
of essential vomit.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.848
And you couldn't say that
in front of Foreman?

14:51.975 --> 14:57.062
No, I couldn't say this
in front of Foreman. I need a refill.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.648
Detective Tritter knows about
the scrips I wrote before.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.151
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.195
Does anyone fall
for that argument?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.364
Write the scrip.

15:07.865 --> 15:08.865
No.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.158
One prescription
isn't gonna make...

15:10.285 --> 15:13.370
We both know
it's not gonna be just one.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.748
I'd rather lose my job
than lose my license.

15:23.506 --> 15:29.386
Daniel Silvers, prostate cancer.
Needs filgrastim, two-week supply.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.888
Andrea Donovan,
breast cancer.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.433
Just needs her refill
on her megestrol.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.436
- You're not writing.
- You want me to write?

15:37.562 --> 15:40.397
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually, yeah,

15:40.523 --> 15:43.358
probably somebody's gonna want
something written down.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.320
- I haven't met these people.
- I have.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.281
- I've diagnosed them and everything.
- I know.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.242
I know. I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.660
Just my diagnoses.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.329
These are gonna be
my prescriptions. I...

15:55.455 --> 15:58.165
- They're my patients. My prescriptions.
- My name!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.544
That Tritter will read
on the scrip.

16:03.588 --> 16:08.133
He wants to make you miserable. You
don't think he's gonna ask questions?

16:09.427 --> 16:12.971
Is there anything Jack does that
no one else does? Any special duties?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.307
No, we got lots of bussers.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.601
What kind of cleaning products
do you use?

16:17.727 --> 16:20.604
We got a bunch of kids running around,
sticking everything in their mouths,

16:20.730 --> 16:24.441
so we can't use
anything toxic.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.319
This is it. Monday's trash.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.244
So there's no one
who can maybe help get the bags out?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.580
Sorry. Short-handed.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.082
I can tip.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.377
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke is in
a blue trash bag with the wrapped gifts,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.880
but if you find spaghetti
that's the wrong vomit.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.016
How much longer
do I have to stay on this medication?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.602
I mean, I'm nauseous
all the time.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.188
Maybe I should go back
on the tamoxifen.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.273
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.025
I'm reluctant to
make a change.

17:07.151 --> 17:11.071
I can't play with my daughter
or pick her up from school.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.739
I can barely get up
and tuck her in at night.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.409
There's got to be
something else.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.827
Who is she?

17:16.953 --> 17:19.287
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

17:19.831 --> 17:22.082
- She's a student?
- No, I'm a doctor.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.875
I'm assisting
Dr. Wilson today.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.961
Why? Do you think he got
my diagnosis wrong?

17:26.087 --> 17:28.380
- No. I'm sure...
- No. No.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.466
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.302
- You think he got my meds wrong?
- No. It's just...

17:34.429 --> 17:36.430
- No.
- Then why is she here?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.770
What are you doing now?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.858
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's spinal fluid.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.317
- Where's Will?
- School.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.530
Is that gonna hurt?

17:53.656 --> 17:56.616
It's gonna help us figure out
what's making him sick.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.286
- Shouldn't you be in class, too?
- Teacher work day.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.912
For you but not Will?

18:01.038 --> 18:03.248
Yeah, didn't make
sense to me, either.

18:06.711 --> 18:07.878
Can I help?

18:09.338 --> 18:13.675
Well, I guess it's quicker than
calling a nurse and a truant officer.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.679
Okay, grab his shins
and push his knees up towards his chest.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.558
Now hold him there tight.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.019
This all nurses do?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.689
My boss doesn't trust them
to do anything else.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.614
Is he gonna die?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.702
No. No one's gonna die.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.163
In the whole world ever?
That's so great.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.042
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.587
But I also know
bad things do happen.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.717
My dad always had a few drinks
when they went out.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.512
Always said
he'd be okay to drive.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.264
Until he wasn't.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.062
I would just like
some warning this time.

19:11.317 --> 19:16.154
We're nowhere near anything like that
happening right now. Okay?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.618
Let's get him back over.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.706
What was that?

19:26.958 --> 19:29.000
What did you do?

19:29.418 --> 19:32.003
- You broke his rib?
- I barely touched him.

19:32.129 --> 19:32.963
Which means...

19:34.465 --> 19:36.216
- Found it.
- Fix it.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.970
steomyelitis. Means the infection's
spread to his bones,

19:40.096 --> 19:43.139
which means it's either bacterial
or viral and not...

19:45.017 --> 19:48.770
I hired you to take away the pain.
Was there some confusion?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.398
Ever thought about
using your cane on the proper side?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.816
Yeah, that's the issue.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.820
Friday night my cane suddenly noticed
it was on the wrong side.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.906
- Can you score me some Vicodin?
- No.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.408
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which...

20:01.534 --> 20:02.784
How long till the culture's...

20:04.912 --> 20:07.205
Why do you only do that
when I'm talking?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.165
You gotta rest your shoulder.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.211
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.559
- Nice cane.
- If I know what you mean.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.479
- Chase, you can stop doing that.
- I'm almost finished.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.481
He's got osteomyelitis.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.693
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

20:36.819 --> 20:42.032
And you can stop, too.
It's syphilis.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.117
- You sure?
- Read the print out.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.916
He's also positive
for Eikenella.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.172
- One of you two screwed up.
- No.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.715
Not a chance.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.055
Or this kid is a lot sicker
than we thought. Finish that test.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.516
Should be impossible to get
two right answers to one question.

21:08.643 --> 21:12.646
- It's okay to have three?
- Apparently.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.815
He's positive
for botulism, too.

21:16.150 --> 21:21.988
So, we knock down one infection
and three more pop up.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.658
I think this game is rigged.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.338
Jack?
Somebody help!

21:38.464 --> 21:40.799
We've managed to clear
all three infections out of his system,

21:40.925 --> 21:42.884
but now he's having seizures
every few hours.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.387
- He's gotta be immunocompromised.
- No.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.681
White count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.974
Well, if he's not
immunocompromised,

21:49.100 --> 21:50.809
why is he acting like
he's immunocompromised?

21:50.935 --> 21:52.102
What do the seizures tell us?

21:52.228 --> 21:54.854
Nothing. There were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

21:54.981 --> 21:57.899
nonfocal neuro exam,
no electrolyte imbalance. Nothing.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.404
What do unexplained seizures and
really sick 18-year-olds have in common?

22:02.530 --> 22:05.865
- You thinking trauma?
- I'm thinking drugs.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.869
He's an admitted user.
The drugs trashed his immune system.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.621
Tox screen was clean.

22:11.747 --> 22:15.041
Clean tox screen means
there's no drugs in his blood or urine.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.254
There could still be drugs trapped in
his fat cells from the good old days.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.840
If they're in his fat,
why would they be affecting him now?

22:21.966 --> 22:25.719
The keen observer would notice that
he's had some digestive issues lately.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.138
His weight loss
could've burned off fat cells

22:28.264 --> 22:30.807
and released the drugs
back into his system.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.060
There's no way to know. It's
impossible to test fat cells for drugs.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.522
But it's not impossible
to make him lose more weight.

22:37.648 --> 22:41.026
You want us to starve him so we can
drive him into another seizure?

22:41.152 --> 22:43.862
Maybe a heart attack?
Just so we can run another tox screen?

22:43.988 --> 22:47.449
That'd be cruel.
Just sweat it out of him.

22:50.161 --> 22:53.788
I haven't touched a thing
since the night my parents died.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.332
Drugs stay in your system
a long time.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.302
I was high the night
the cops came to tell us what happened.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.932
You know the first thing I did
when they told me?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.353
I laughed.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.233
I'm not the person
I was when they died.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.403
I wish they could see that.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.741
Well, I'm sure they're watching,
and I'm sure they're proud.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.578
That's what Will's guidance counselor
keeps telling him.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.413
What do you tell him?

23:37.666 --> 23:39.292
I tell him it's crap.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.506
Our parents live on in our memories,
but they don't live on.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.264
Jack?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.557
Hold him still.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.517
Don't break his arm.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.894
We'll fix it.
We need to get a sample.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.565
House.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.692
Bad news.

24:04.819 --> 24:05.860
Look at you.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.364
You couldn't have sent Cameron down
here to this air-conditioned hallway

24:09.490 --> 24:10.448
to deliver the bad news?

24:10.574 --> 24:14.035
Jack seized again, but his blood
was clean. Completely drug free.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.955
So he just happened to have a seizure
at the exact time

24:17.081 --> 24:18.414
that we stuck him in a sauna?

24:18.541 --> 24:19.457
It's not a coincidence.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.336
He's still seizing every few hours
whether we stick him in a sauna or not.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.840
Oh, my God!
Why are you using that?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.843
I've had it for years.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.138
No, that's...
That's gonna make your shoulder hurt.

24:33.264 --> 24:34.389
You need one of these.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.308
He's a doctor.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.395
- Is he still infection-free?
- I'm sure not for long.

24:40.521 --> 24:44.232
My point being that something other than
those infections caused these seizures.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.817
Means there's something
in his head. Scan him.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.736
- We scanned him.
- Well, that was then. This is not then.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.072
Kid keeps changing.
Scan him again.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.574
Where is Cameron?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.826
I am not writing you
a script for Vicodin.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.162
I've only got two pills left.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.664
Cut them in half.
Then you'll have four.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.500
You're prescribing for Wilson.
Wilson prescribes for me.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.002
Write up a scrip.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.045
- You know you have a problem.
- Yeah.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.297
It's got a badge
and everything.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.133
- You're taking too much...
- Fine! You're right.

25:10.259 --> 25:14.304
What's the correct amount? Write up
a scrip for the correct amount.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.641
No answer? That's 'cause
we're having the wrong debate.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.310
This has got nothing
to do with my problem

25:20.436 --> 25:21.895
and everything to do with you
avoiding a problem.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.730
You're afraid that
if you write me a prescription

25:23.856 --> 25:24.856
you're gonna wind up
like Wilson.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.774
Of course I am.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.779
Tritter wants to win
by giving pain.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.074
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.951
As a doctor,
how do you do that?

25:44.501 --> 25:45.501
Here.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.755
This'll tide you over.
Takes the edge off my PMS.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.798
Should do wonders for you.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.640
Why are you
looking at my head again?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.643
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.228
I'm not gonna get better.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.438
Am I?

26:06.357 --> 26:08.233
We'll know more
after the test.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.278
I've gotta find out
who can take care of Will and Kama.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.155
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

26:15.616 --> 26:19.744
You'll be home yelling at them and
kicking their butts before you know it.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.214
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

26:31.340 --> 26:33.299
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.093
Brain stem's clean.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.845
- Nothing in the midbrain.
- What's that?

26:38.514 --> 26:40.974
The frontal lobe,
upper-right quadrant.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.393
- I don't see anything.
- There.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.438
It's tiny,
but I think it's a tumor.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.150
That size should be excisable. Why
didn't we see it earlier? How could...

26:51.277 --> 26:52.652
Oh, God!

26:53.737 --> 26:55.613
Axial view.
There's another one.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.532
Bring up the next slice.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.120
They're everywhere.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.377
Jack's brain is
riddled with tumors.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.547
- And you know what he's doing?
- Moaning?

27:12.673 --> 27:16.134
- Setting up play dates.
- Wow, what a guy. Theories?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.553
The obvious one, brain cancer
destroyed his immune system,

27:18.679 --> 27:20.430
left him wide open
for these infections.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.557
House, you're pathetic.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.477
You'll analyze anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses,

27:26.603 --> 27:27.770
but this kid's
got some strength,

27:27.896 --> 27:30.690
and all of a sudden there's no time
to talk about anything but the medicine.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.359
He's teaching pre-pubescent kids
that truth matters,

27:33.485 --> 27:36.821
God doesn't and life sucks.
I like him. Treatment?

27:36.947 --> 27:38.531
We need to
start him on radiation.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.742
That'll destroy whatever's left
of his immune system.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.869
And save his life!

27:42.995 --> 27:45.496
I know the notion of self-sacrifice
is foreign to you...

27:45.622 --> 27:49.208
You wanna think that he's sacrificing
himself because if one person can do it,

27:49.335 --> 27:53.254
then maybe the world isn't the cold,
selfish place you know that it is.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.757
Radiation could kill him.
Alternatives?

27:55.883 --> 27:58.134
There aren't any.
We saw the tumors...

27:58.260 --> 28:00.803
We could choose
to say they aren't tumors.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.182
They're just pus, which would explain
why they weren't there yesterday.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.476
It can't be an infection.
He got IVIG,

28:06.602 --> 28:08.603
- broad-spectrum antibiotics...
- Exactly.

28:08.729 --> 28:12.440
Creates a perfect world
for fungus, moves in, gets married,

28:12.566 --> 28:13.566
has little fungi...

28:13.692 --> 28:17.111
If you're wrong about the fungus, you're
wasting what little time he has left.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.365
Not a big sacrifice.
His life sucks.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.160
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle in the kid's head.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.161
If you suck out a liquid,

28:25.287 --> 28:26.704
then I'm right
and we haven't answered anything.

28:26.830 --> 28:31.459
If you suck out a solid, you're right
and no more worrying about play dates.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.592
Okay. Fine.
I'll father your child.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.261
First, you got to write me
a Vicodin prescription,

28:42.388 --> 28:43.930
just so I can
get through the foreplay.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.306
How many days
do you have left?

28:45.432 --> 28:48.059
Could probably get through
maybe the next minute or so.

28:48.185 --> 28:52.772
And your coming to me means your lackeys
actually stood up to you. I'm impressed.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.024
Yes, their cowardice
is inspiring.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.859
Well, you should be
thanking them.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.986
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

28:59.113 --> 29:02.240
that you intimidated underlings
to feed your addiction.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.117
I hate writing
thank-you notes.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.037
Would it be weird if I asked Cameron
to write them? You're hooking me up?

29:08.163 --> 29:11.124
Unfortunately, if I cut you off,
it'd give the cops evidence

29:11.250 --> 29:12.500
that you don't really
need the pain meds.

29:12.626 --> 29:17.130
I knew that cleavage was a smokescreen.
You're a genius.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.550
- You can't lift your arm.
- You can't pee standing up.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.927
- Gimme.
- You been doing physio?

29:23.595 --> 29:24.554
- Maybe you pulled...
- Yeah.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.056
Been training for Pants-Off Dance-Off.
Give me the script.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.642
Your shoulder problem
isn't physical.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.602
We'll find out
if you ever give me that...

29:31.728 --> 29:32.812
What's new?

29:32.938 --> 29:35.064
What's different? Any big changes
in your life recently?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.941
Fight with the wife maybe?

29:37.568 --> 29:41.362
It's good.
Means your shoulder's a human being.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.738
It's a start.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.869
- I'm right. Right?
- Yeah.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.412
Just not about me.

30:01.008 --> 30:01.841
I was right, right?

30:01.967 --> 30:04.635
They were abscesses
from a fungal infection. Aspergillus.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.596
But we still have
no idea why.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.558
Our kid's immune system
has a factory defect. It's genetic.

30:10.684 --> 30:11.767
It can't be genetic.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.728
He would've been getting infections
since he was an infant.

30:13.854 --> 30:17.190
- Not if he grew up in a bubble.
- Or if he grew up on Mars.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.193
- No germs there, either.
- I don't mean a literal bubble.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.613
A sweet suburban bubble where mommies
and daddies protect their children.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.740
They die. Bubble bursts.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.493
Continuing emotional trauma
triggers the genetic illness.

30:28.619 --> 30:29.994
Question is, which one?

30:30.120 --> 30:33.664
The infections he's contracted
narrow down the possibilities.

30:33.874 --> 30:37.001
Hep A indicates
a problem with his B cells.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.462
- Bruton's Agammaglobulinemia?
- Eikenella.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.005
Points to
a complement deficiency.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.093
- I have a patient. I need...
- Not now.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.095
- I'll go.
- You'll stay.

30:48.222 --> 30:50.181
- Patient's dying.
- So is mine.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.391
Not in the next hour.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.352
What does
the syphilis tell us?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.314
What does it tell us?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.484
It could mean
chronic granulomatous disease.

31:01.610 --> 31:05.988
And the aspergillus is a T cell issue.
Common variable immunodeficiency.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.492
Genetic testing's
gonna take time.

31:09.618 --> 31:10.993
Given the rate
he's picking up infections...

31:11.119 --> 31:12.328
Why don't we
turn it into a race?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.038
Little late to be
playing games with us.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.542
- Not you guys. The infections.
- What infections?

31:19.002 --> 31:21.546
The infections
we're gonna give him.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.258
The only way to cure me
is to make me sicker?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.635
Each of the four
possible genetic conditions

31:27.761 --> 31:31.180
is most susceptible to
different types of infection.

31:31.932 --> 31:32.807
What's that?

31:34.101 --> 31:39.272
This is a cocktail of serratia,
meningococcus, cepacia and rhinovirus.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.691
Whichever germ
gains the most ground

31:41.817 --> 31:44.944
plants the flag of its leader,
gives us our answer.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.114
And how are you gonna know
which one gains the most ground?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.074
Well, that's the fun part.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.287
See, if the meningococcus is king of the
hill, you get to have another seizure.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.080
Serratia will shut down your lungs.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.249
If it's cepacia,
you'll have a heart attack.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.085
And if it's the rhinovirus,
you'll sneeze.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.715
They can't all be dramatic.
We good?

32:05.841 --> 32:06.841
Hell, no.

32:06.967 --> 32:10.886
Well, the alternative is we guess,
and there's a three out of four chance

32:11.013 --> 32:15.016
that your little brother and sister
will get to cry over another coffin.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.269
You study fractions in school?
We good?

32:31.825 --> 32:35.786
And this test isn't
exactly FDA approved,

32:35.912 --> 32:38.581
so let's just keep it
our little secret, okay?

33:41.728 --> 33:45.439
Little Orphan Annie and Oliver Twist
slept in our hallways last night.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.816
Are they singing?

33:46.942 --> 33:49.568
They're children.
They need a guardian.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.153
Couldn't find a babysitter

33:51.279 --> 33:53.239
on account of not being able
to make any phone calls,

33:53.365 --> 33:54.657
on account of
not being able to breathe,

33:54.783 --> 33:57.201
on account of his lungs
filling up with serratia.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.870
He has chronic
granulomatous disease.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.831
Game over.
Our work is done.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.582
Then he's gonna
keep getting sick.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.334
You gotta call
Social Services.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.379
Bone marrow transplant would re-boot
his whole immune system.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.090
He'll be healthy enough to win
Miserable Daddy of the Year.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.967
So see if one of
his kids is a match.

34:13.093 --> 34:15.136
My kids are
already testing his kids.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.223
Will's a match.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.307
You tested him?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.977
- I never consented for that.
- It's just a blood draw.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.520
- There's no danger.
- To the testing.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.815
- What about the surgery?
- The risk for Will is next to nothing.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.489
What if I don't do it?
What are my other options?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.285
Your immune system
can't fight off the germs

34:39.411 --> 34:41.579
we all come into contact
with every day.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.749
Now that we know,
we can use more targeted medications,

34:44.875 --> 34:49.086
but you'll still get sick
all the time.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.130
You'll be in and out
of hospitals...

34:51.256 --> 34:52.715
But I'll live.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.764
Jack,

35:01.725 --> 35:04.602
your lifespan will be
substantially shortened.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.607
And you'll be too sick to care
for your brother and sister anymore.

35:09.733 --> 35:10.858
You shouldn't have pressured him into...

35:10.984 --> 35:11.817
There was no pressure.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.028
He's eight years old!

35:14.154 --> 35:15.780
You tell him his brother's dying
unless he helps.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.948
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- He wants to help you.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.950
He has no idea.

35:20.494 --> 35:25.873
It's like you asked him to let me play
with one of his toys. This is surgery.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.375
- He could die.
- He'll be fine.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.920
But you...

35:31.046 --> 35:34.256
You're gonna have a hard time
protecting him like this if you're dead.

35:38.553 --> 35:39.762
I'll do it...

35:41.306 --> 35:44.183
when Will's 18
and can decide for himself.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.527
- Noble.
- Moronic.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.155
It's a synonym.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.033
Why can't you accept
he wants to protect his brother?

36:01.159 --> 36:03.619
Has to protect his brother.
Doesn't want to.

36:03.745 --> 36:07.081
Wants to run screaming
from protecting his brother.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.625
You're a hypocrite.

36:11.837 --> 36:16.882
"Evidence is everything.
Truth is all that matters."

36:17.384 --> 36:20.052
Except when
it comes to people.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.430
Everything we've learned
about this kid says you're wrong.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.350
But you can't accept that.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.894
It's easy to
reject the diagnosis.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.730
Not so easy to
reject your misanthropy,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.734
because then you'd have to give
people a fighting chance.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.779
And that scares
the crap out of you.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.199
Okay.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.579
Let's get some evidence.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.503
It's your lucky day.

36:54.629 --> 36:58.048
Just found another donor
in the registry. Perfect match.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.843
We can do the transplant
with no danger to the rug rat.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.053
Just have to sign here.

37:05.140 --> 37:08.058
Unless there's another reason
you don't want it.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.185
There's a chance I'd die.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.813
A chance you'll be cured.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.566
Maybe you don't
want that, either.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.485
Maybe hanging out in a hospital
getting waited on hand and foot

37:18.612 --> 37:20.029
reminds you of what life used to be like

37:20.155 --> 37:23.032
before you were forced
to play Mister Mom.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.700
I don't like being sick.

37:24.826 --> 37:27.828
But you don't want
to be healthy, either.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.496
This is your way out.

37:29.623 --> 37:30.539
Guilt free.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.335
I said I'd do it
when Will's 18.

37:34.461 --> 37:38.088
And he's able to take care
of himself without you.

37:38.882 --> 37:42.051
Jack, your brother and sister need you.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.887
I know! I know every second
of every day that they need me,

37:45.013 --> 37:47.473
but I'm too young
to be their dad.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.900
Good for you.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.200
Don't pretend
you're surprised.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.802
Want to go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

38:26.388 --> 38:28.180
Come on. Mail can wait.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.141
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.560
- I'm shutting down my practice.
- Oh, good.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.354
'Cause I was afraid
you might overreact.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.189
I can't just ask
my patients to wait

38:37.315 --> 38:39.692
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won't let her come out and play!

38:39.818 --> 38:41.485
I kept you waiting for maybe an hour...

38:41.611 --> 38:42.736
Three hours!

38:43.697 --> 38:46.073
- Anybody die?
- Not this time.

38:46.199 --> 38:49.243
Cameron's available now.
Use her all you want.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.829
So now's a better time for me
to have my life taken away?

38:51.955 --> 38:54.915
- It fits into your schedule better?
- Oh, poor you.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.043
- Think if you suffer loudly enough...
- You committed a crime!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.545
What do you want me to do?
Turn myself in?

38:59.671 --> 39:03.048
Yes! Yes! Do something!
Go in! Show some remorse!

39:03.174 --> 39:04.675
Tell Tritter
you'll get some help!

39:04.801 --> 39:06.051
I don't need help!

39:07.971 --> 39:11.807
House, get out of here.
Get out of here.

39:13.643 --> 39:17.646
You are not gonna make me feel guilty
about what Tritter is doing to us.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.066
You already feel guilty.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.611
Your mysterious shoulder pain
isn't coming from your cane.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.822
It's coming from
your conscience.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.491
That used to be enough.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.661
Despite all your smartass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn.

39:32.787 --> 39:33.829
This time...

39:36.541 --> 39:39.877
You were either gonna
help me through this or you weren't.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.712
I got my answer.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.771
Who's gonna
drive me to school,

39:59.606 --> 40:01.065
help me with my homework?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.234
There'll be a mom
where they take you.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.530
A real mom,
someone who can cook.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.163
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to see you guys.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.544
You said
you'd make him better.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.880
I'm sorry.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.769
Thank you
for not telling them.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.273
You're a good kid.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.695
Three months from now,
six months from now,

41:31.030 --> 41:34.533
you'll be visiting them
and you won't be able to say goodbye.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.744
You're gonna know
you screwed up.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.583
You'll take his bone marrow
and you'll take them back.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.171
And they'll be a burden
and a pain,

41:48.715 --> 41:51.633
and your life will never be
what it was supposed to be.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.304
But you'll be proud
of yourself.

41:57.849 --> 42:02.019
And your parents,
they'll be proud of you.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.565
I don't think so.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.365
It's what I wanna believe.
