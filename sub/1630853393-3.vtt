00:07.007 --> 00:09.926
Jerry Vincent was going to trial
on the biggest case of his life,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.469
and he had no defense at all?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.513
When Lorna was going over Jerry's book,

00:13.596 --> 00:16.808
she found a bunch of payments
to an investigator. Bruce Carlin.

00:16.891 --> 00:20.020
All I know is, last few weeks,
Jerry was scared of something.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.813
My boss has reason to be worried?

00:21.896 --> 00:26.568
Jerry gamble much? He went to this place
three different times in the last month.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.613
What if he just needed the money
'cause he blew it all here?

00:30.697 --> 00:34.451
What if Jerry
was just an addict, same as us?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.745
You need this
just as much as I do.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.621
This is your one shot.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.668
The only thing he ever said
was that he had a magic bullet.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.795
What was that all about?
What's a magic bullet?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.422
The thing that can't lose.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.299
<i>Anybody following us today?</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:52.260
<i>Nope, not today. All clear.</i>

01:07.942 --> 01:09.152
One thing I know,

01:09.986 --> 01:13.740
in court, success is all about momentum.

01:13.823 --> 01:17.660
Before you can win,
you gotta act like you can win,

01:17.744 --> 01:20.330
which means you gotta believe you can win.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.873
But what if you don't?

01:22.540 --> 01:25.418
Then you better
fake it till you make it.

01:27.128 --> 01:27.962
Thanks.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.676
Haller?

01:33.760 --> 01:34.761
What a miracle, dude!

01:34.844 --> 01:36.096
What's up, Luis?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.515
Haven't seen you.
Where you been?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.599
Been around.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.357
Hey, Mick.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.983
-Hey, Tony.
-Long time, no see.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.318
How's it going?

01:50.401 --> 01:52.737
Been killin' it.
I just got a drug case kicked.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.696
No shit.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.407
Crime lab was so backed up,
some techs were dry-labbing.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.244
We're getting together
for Jerry later, over at Casey's.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.995
-You gotta stop by.
-Oh, yeah?

02:01.079 --> 02:04.457
And hey, if you need
a second chair in the Elliott case…

02:04.541 --> 02:06.209
-I'll keep you in mind.
-This guy here.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.670
-Let's catch a Dodgers game soon.
-You got it.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.382
…57224. <i>People vs. Kymberly Wagstaff.</i>

02:12.465 --> 02:15.718
Good morning, Your Honor.
Mickey Haller for the defendant.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.012
Your Honor, I'm afraid Miss Wagstaff

02:18.096 --> 02:19.764
used her one phone call on me

02:19.848 --> 02:22.183
just a couple hours ago,
so I apologize, but I…

02:22.267 --> 02:25.395
-I haven't seen a police report yet.
-Ramon?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.856
<i>Gracias,</i> Ramon.

02:29.023 --> 02:34.237
Miss Wagstaff, you are charged
with a violation of Penal Code 647,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.239
commonly known as lewd conduct.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.574
How do you wish to plead?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.909
The human body is beautiful, Your Honor.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.911
Undoubtedly. Would that be guilty?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.372
Your Honor,
may I confer with my client please?

02:44.455 --> 02:46.166
Would it matter if I said no?

02:46.249 --> 02:48.877
Thank you for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.086
No one was answering.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.422
Sorry about that.
I've been out of commission.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.590
What are we talking about?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.300
How uptight this country is.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.303
In Europe, everyone
walks around on the beach topless.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.972
But, come on,
this is what, your seventh offense?

03:01.055 --> 03:04.225
They're gonna ask for cash bail.
Unless you got a couple grand--

03:04.309 --> 03:05.643
-A couple grand?
-Yes.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.230
No. I have to get out of here today.
I have a thesis defense on Friday.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.983
Thesis? What is it about?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.319
Randomization in numerical linear algebra.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.572
Do something.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.991
All right, let me try something.

03:20.074 --> 03:24.329
Your Honor, I'm afraid
it's impossible for my client to plead

03:24.412 --> 03:25.788
when there's no offense alleged.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.791
Nice try,
but the offense is clearly alleged.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.503
Sunbathing topless on a public beach,
despite repeated past warnings.

03:32.587 --> 03:36.049
According to the police report,
the officer found Miss Wagstaff

03:36.132 --> 03:37.592
in the water up to her neck,

03:37.675 --> 03:40.261
and there's no record
of any complaint prior to that.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.346
So?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.598
So, by ordering her out of the water,

03:43.681 --> 03:47.060
the officer created the very offense
with which my client is charged.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.939
You're kidding me, right?
That's a question for a jury.

03:51.022 --> 03:55.610
Well, if Your Honor really thinks
that's the best use of judicial resources.

03:55.693 --> 04:00.281
Do you have a witness who could testify
that they were offended by Miss Wagstaff

04:00.365 --> 04:03.159
before the officer
ordered her out of the water?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.994
Not at the moment, Your Honor.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.955
Do you know what this is?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.958
It's my docket for today.

04:10.833 --> 04:15.088
Miss Wagstaff,
keep your damn top on from now on.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.673
Charge dismissed.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.593
Thank you so much. You are a lifesaver.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.847
Can we work out like a payment plan
or a student discount, or something?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.349
Lorna will be in touch.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.685
And, please, Kym,
just use your head next time.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.645
It's obviously in good working order.

04:30.728 --> 04:31.980
I'm so happy you're back.

04:32.063 --> 04:35.984
Yeah, me too. It's been a little rough.
I've been getting back on my feet.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.068
-Come on.
-Thank you.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.319
Mr. Haller.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.570
Yes, Your Honor?

04:39.654 --> 04:43.032
It seems I have you back
in my courtroom again this afternoon.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.660
What an unexpected treat.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.997
For which case is this, Your Honor?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.416
People vs. Eli Wyms.

04:51.499 --> 04:56.337
It's one of Mr. Vincent's cases.
I'm assuming you will handle this as well?

04:58.256 --> 05:01.259
Yes, yes, Mr. Wyms.

05:01.342 --> 05:05.054
Of course, Your Honor, I'll be there.
I'll be here, Your Honor. Thank you.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.600
Who the fuck is Eli Wyms?

05:09.684 --> 05:12.562
I thought you said
you had Jerry's calendar under control.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.774
There's nothing in the calendar.
Not even a file, and I've looked twice.

05:16.858 --> 05:17.984
<i>What do you mean?</i>

05:18.067 --> 05:19.027
<i>You heard me.</i>

05:19.110 --> 05:22.739
There's nothing anywhere in this office
with the name Eli Wyms on it.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.408
<i>Find out whatever you can.</i>
<i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:31.664
And so, you work
in a nursing facility, is that correct?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.792
A facility owned by this man. Angelo Soto?

05:34.876 --> 05:35.710
Yes.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.838
And every few months,
new Filipino immigrants turn up to work

05:38.921 --> 05:40.882
in this facility, is that correct?

05:40.965 --> 05:41.799
Yes.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.762
Mr. Loresca,
can you explain to the grand jury, please,

05:45.845 --> 05:48.139
what you've observed
regarding these workers?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.892
A bus would come in the morning.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.311
Maybe 25 people.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.481
They kept them
separate from the rest of us.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.398
"They"?

05:58.107 --> 06:00.193
The people who watch over them.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.363
People who work for Mr. Soto.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.616
Are these workers
treated the same as the rest of you?

06:07.241 --> 06:08.076
No.

06:09.035 --> 06:09.911
They were scared.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.290
If they talked to us
in English or Tagalog,

06:14.374 --> 06:15.958
someone would tell them not to.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.752
At lunch…

06:20.755 --> 06:23.424
they ate the scraps
the patients left on their plates.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.931
Mr. Loresca,
when you get your paycheck on payday,

06:30.014 --> 06:33.601
have you ever seen
any of these workers get paid?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.395
No.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.022
Never.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.287
Hey, what's up?

06:54.330 --> 06:55.623
Soto's leaving.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.251
He booked a flight
for the Philippines tomorrow.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.795
Think he heard about the grand jury?
It's under seal.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.380
Looks like a regular business trip.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.882
Once they return
the indictment, it's public. He'll know.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.636
And if he's out of the country,
we'll never get him back. Okay.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.764
I've got my star witness on the stand.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.891
We'll get him
to return the indictment today.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.270
-Is that gonna be enough?
-Gonna have to be. This is too important.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.022
Building this case for six months,
I'm not gonna stop now.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.482
Okay, keep me posted.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.733
Sorry to interrupt.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.152
That's okay, we're done.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.653
Detective Lankford.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.406
What, you two have a case together?

07:28.489 --> 07:29.740
You could say that.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.160
She's 5'6" and a hell of a soccer player.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.161
Huh.

07:34.245 --> 07:38.207
Well, look at that.
Learn something new every day, don't you?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.168
Guess you do.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.627
I'll be in touch.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.508
I take it you two know each other.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.760
Is there anyone in my life
you haven't pissed off?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.804
It's not my fault the guy's an asshole.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.098
Just be careful with him.
I don't trust him.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.143
Like there is a cop in LA
you do trust.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.020
No, but I keep looking.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.855
-Got my message?
-Yes.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.900
For the record, I didn't say
anything to Golantz about you.

08:03.983 --> 08:08.404
Well, he seemed to have a pretty good idea
I spent the last six months getting clean.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.780
It's not a secret.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.992
This place is like high school
with bailiffs. You told me that.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.495
If Golantz wants to play, we'll play.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.288
He wants to win. Same as you.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.249
I gotta go. See you at the game Saturday?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.418
-Hayley's starting.
-You better believe it.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.755
Hey, we should
just go for pizza after, like we used to.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.799
-Maybe, we'll see.
-Come on, Maggie, you love that place.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.637
You can order cannoli,
then I'll eat it, like I used to.

08:33.262 --> 08:36.057
I said, we'll see. Okay?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.494
Speaking of cops I don't trust.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.995
Feeling's mutual.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.456
Especially when
you keep holding out on me.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.499
Holding out on you?

09:01.582 --> 09:04.293
Yeah. That suspect list
you gave me was a dead end.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.170
Protecting one of your new clients?

09:06.254 --> 09:09.257
I…
You're unbelievable, you know that?

09:09.340 --> 09:11.717
I bent over backwards
to get you that list.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.845
You got something real to ask me
or you just gonna bitch and moan?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.265
-'Cause I got shit to do.
-Take a look at this.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.936
We got it from a traffic camera
outside Jerry's building,

09:22.019 --> 09:23.229
around the time he was shot.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.565
So you got a suspect?

09:25.648 --> 09:28.359
Maybe. He look familiar?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.111
No, not to me.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.072
But Jerry's old assistant is coming by
to pick up the rest of her stuff.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.282
Let me take a picture.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.534
No way.
It's our first solid lead we've had.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.411
Not letting you run around with it.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.539
-I'll bring it by your office later.
-Suit yourself.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.333
Got a murder trial to prepare for.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.876
Yeah. Trevor Elliott.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.547
Funny, his lawyer got killed, he didn't.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.300
I'd keep that in mind if I were you.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.082
Got anything on Eli Wyms?

10:25.166 --> 10:29.462
Docket entry. Attempted murder
of a police officer, multiple counts.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.964
Multiple? That's ambitious.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.551
<i>They brought him in from Sylmar,</i>
<i>County Mental Health.</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:38.512
Yeah, Jerry must've
sent him over for a psych evaluation.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.473
<i>There is some good news.</i>

10:40.556 --> 10:43.809
Prosecutor's Joanne Giorgetti.
She still Hayley's soccer coach?

10:44.935 --> 10:47.897
Yeah, that relationship is a bit delicate.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.984
Yeah, I still don't understand
why there's no file on this guy.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.820
My theory
is that it was in Jerry's briefcase

10:54.904 --> 10:56.238
the night he was killed.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.573
That's why it's not here.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.742
On that cheery note…

11:27.144 --> 11:28.312
Here.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.317
You asked me to get ahold of Elliott.
He's set aside the whole day tomorrow.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.950
Still getting used
to working out of an office.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.202
What's all this?

11:43.285 --> 11:46.288
You wanted
the rundown on the wife's boyfriend.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.249
-Jan Rilz, the yoga teacher.
-And?

11:48.332 --> 11:50.626
We've gone through his stuff,
but nothing definitive.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.170
I don't need definitive.
I'll take plausible.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.716
Tell me you got something for me.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.008
Define "something."

11:58.092 --> 11:59.051
What is this?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.554
This is the security footage

12:01.637 --> 12:04.724
from outside the casino
that Jerry Vincent kept going to.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.436
Haller Associates, may I help you?
I'm sorry, he's not available.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.563
There. That is Jerry.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.482
Who's the other guy?
What papers did he just hand over?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.234
No idea.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.279
Cops are tryin' to ID him,
but nothin' just yet.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.157
But at least we know
Jerry wasn't gambling.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.616
Where'd you find this?

12:22.700 --> 12:25.703
My source at the LAPD.
Better you don't know.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.788
Think it's got
anything to do with Elliott?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.541
I mean,
I've been over that file a hundred times.

12:30.624 --> 12:34.295
If Jerry had a magic bullet,
I sure as hell can't find it.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.047
Yeah? Well, there's something else.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.759
Remember him? Bruce Carlin.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.677
Jerry's investigator?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.972
Yeah. He's in the wind.
Whereabouts unknown.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.976
Your buddy Griggs put the word
out on him, but so far nothing.

12:49.059 --> 12:53.022
He even left his Corvette.
Which tells me he doesn't wanna be found.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.567
Thing is, Carlin has an alibi.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.528
The cops know he didn't kill Jerry.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.155
Then why did he run?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.365
Maybe he knows who did.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.912
And maybe whoever it is
caught up with him.

13:08.996 --> 13:09.872
Great.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.334
Yeah.

13:15.044 --> 13:15.878
What?

13:15.961 --> 13:19.673
I don't wanna worry Lorna,
but Griggs showed me a photo.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.927
He thinks it might be Jerry's killer
coming out of the building.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.431
My source didn't mention it.
He's usually pretty good.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.558
Yeah, Griggs plays everything tight.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.727
Just run your source again,

13:31.811 --> 13:35.105
see if LAPD
has any idea who this guy is, all right?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.065
Good job.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.277
Okay.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.913
Something else?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.289
Yeah.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.793
This whole case is weird, Mick.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.963
You working here
late at night. I don't like it.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.382
I can take care of myself.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.801
Yeah. Well, there's Lorna, too.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.431
What's that? Your lunch?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.809
Jesus. Cisco.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.477
Just a little peace of mind.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.898
There's an internal safety,
you just pull the trigger.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.900
I don't have a license to carry a gun--

14:19.984 --> 14:23.654
You're not carrying it, are you?
It's registered to me. 100% legal.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.364
I'm just storing it here.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.492
What? Trust, but verify.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.288
Whatever. If it makes you feel better,
put it in there. I don't wanna touch it.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.540
Better to have it and not need it, than…

14:36.834 --> 14:37.918
You know the rest.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.690
Eli?

15:00.900 --> 15:01.901
Eli Wyms?

15:09.074 --> 15:09.950
Eli?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.245
Eli.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.456
My name is Mickey Haller, I'm your lawyer.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.875
Do you understand?

15:20.127 --> 15:21.003
Eli?

15:21.545 --> 15:22.922
Can you hear me?

15:24.548 --> 15:25.466
Great.

15:27.384 --> 15:28.636
Guard.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.475
Hey, what's up, Coach?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.895
You have not
earned the right to call me that again.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.648
Come on, Jo. That was a year ago now.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.232
Refs have long memories,

15:42.316 --> 15:44.985
especially when dads
yell at them from the sideline.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.737
-Yeah.
-Almost cost us the game.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.657
Keyword being "almost."

15:50.491 --> 15:52.660
I'm a different person now, Jo.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.329
Are you covering this for Jerry?

15:55.412 --> 15:57.623
-What the hell happened?
-Nobody knows.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.125
I'm like a hamster
on a wheel trying to catch up.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.795
Speaking of which,
I don't have a file on this guy.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.046
You mind if I--

16:04.129 --> 16:07.508
I can get you a copy of the discovery,
but it'll take a day.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.762
Us poor DAs don't have
all the staff you fancy defense guys have.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.972
I owe you one, Jo.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.391
You owe me more than one.

16:15.474 --> 16:19.561
Here, look at mine for now.
Just not the privileged stuff.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.274
Guy's a vet?

16:24.358 --> 16:27.403
Twice decorated in Iraq. A sniper.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.947
Wife kicked him out.
Case of High Life later,

16:30.030 --> 16:33.117
he's sleeping it off
in a truck in Topanga State Park.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.411
Sheriff's Department
got reports of gunfire,

16:35.494 --> 16:37.663
so they sent a cruiser out to investigate.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.791
But when the Deputy
called it in, all hell broke loose.

16:40.874 --> 16:44.837
Three hours and 90-some
rounds later, they had Wyms in custody.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.422
It's a miracle nobody was hit.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.132
Pretty obvious plea bargain.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.676
Which is where
I was headed with the public defender

16:50.759 --> 16:52.594
before Jerry took the case.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.889
Wait. Wyms had a public defender?

16:56.932 --> 16:58.684
How did Jerry end up with the case?

16:58.767 --> 17:02.187
Beats me.
I figured he needed the pro-bono hours.

17:02.271 --> 17:06.400
And then he sent the guy out to County
for a competency evaluation?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.193
Which just prolonged it even more.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.404
From what the PD told me,

17:10.487 --> 17:14.408
Wyms was a pain in the ass,
but he was competent.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.952
All they did at County
was pump him full of drugs.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.122
You wanna plead it out, I'm all ears.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.041
All rise.

17:23.834 --> 17:29.089
LA-112895. <i>People vs. Eli Wyms.</i>

17:29.173 --> 17:30.507
Oh, Mr. Haller.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.763
Twice in a day.
My dreams have finally come true.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.474
Are we setting a trial date here?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.933
Approach, Your Honor?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.731
I think we can come
to a plea in this matter.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.817
But first I need a cease-and-desist
to get my client off his meds.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.652
Or I can't even speak with the guy.

17:50.736 --> 17:54.990
Respectfully, this guy used a park full
of Sheriff's Deputies for target practice.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.409
What happens when
he shanks somebody in the day room?

17:57.493 --> 18:00.287
What happens
when he finally does come off the meds,

18:00.370 --> 18:02.331
and doesn't like the deal we negotiate?

18:02.414 --> 18:05.000
You want him
coming after the State for forcing him,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086
while incompetent, to make that decision?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.378
Miss Giorgetti?

18:13.550 --> 18:16.762
Better keep your damn mouth shut
at the game this weekend.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.769
She won't leave. It's been like an hour.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.796
You're taking the fish?

18:51.505 --> 18:52.881
Jerry loved that fish.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.010
I wrote a speech.
For Jerry's memorial tonight.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.011
Do you wanna hear?

18:58.095 --> 19:01.265
I would love to, honey,
but I am up to my ears here.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.520
What is all this?

19:06.603 --> 19:08.647
This is the Trevor Elliott case.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.566
You know how you said
you had a magic bullet,

19:10.649 --> 19:13.402
we're thinking
it was a third-party culpability defense.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.487
A what?

19:16.071 --> 19:17.990
Pointing the finger at someone else.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.493
Like, maybe
the wife's boyfriend was the real target.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.871
So, I'm looking
at all his other yoga clients

19:23.954 --> 19:26.707
and cross-referencing them
with his bank statements to--

19:32.171 --> 19:34.548
Does the name Carol Dubois
mean anything to you?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.258
No. Should it?

19:36.341 --> 19:41.346
There in his private yoga journal,
he used initials to be discreet.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.143
But this Carol Dubois
wrote him a check for 25 grand.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.936
That's a lot of <i>namaste.</i>

19:56.486 --> 19:57.738
<i>Leave a message.</i>

19:59.698 --> 20:02.159
I'm not bothering you by being here, am I?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.453
No. I just… I have to go do something,

20:04.536 --> 20:08.832
so, you can just lock up before you go
and good luck with your speech tonight.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.043
You knock 'em dead. Sorry.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.127
Bad choice of words.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.681
Birria.
Goat stew, the real thing.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.974
Did you say "goat"?

20:26.725 --> 20:28.852
Yeah. This will change your life.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.943
-Damn.
-Right?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.319
-Told you.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.114
Do you know every place in LA?

20:41.198 --> 20:42.074
A lot of 'em.

20:43.659 --> 20:47.079
There's always new stuff
or they just build on top of the old.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.040
How long have you lived here?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.334
Well, I was born here.

20:53.377 --> 20:58.340
When my parents split up,
I went to live in Mexico City with my mom.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.343
But I spent
most of my summers here with my dad

21:01.426 --> 21:04.096
and, I don't know,
this place gets under your skin.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.764
"Tip the world over on its side

21:05.847 --> 21:08.183
and everything loose
will land in Los Angeles."

21:08.850 --> 21:10.269
Frank Lloyd Wright.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.521
I think.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.189
Hmm.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.609
Told you. Life's changing.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.821
-Slowly and surely.
-Imparting knowledge right now.

21:26.743 --> 21:30.747
No. Minus the deductible.
You always have to pay a deductible.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.583
Sir, I didn't make the rules, I--

21:33.667 --> 21:36.712
Well, of course.
You always have that option.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.630
You too, sir.

21:40.340 --> 21:44.386
Sorry about that.
Some people just think they're special.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.556
Now, what can I do for you?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.933
Well, thank you
for agreeing to meet with me.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.769
First of all,
I didn't wanna discuss this over the phone

21:52.853 --> 21:54.563
because it's a bit delicate.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.315
It concerns Jan Rilz.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.776
Jan? What about him?

22:01.361 --> 22:06.533
Well, I work for a law firm
that is looking into some potential claims

22:06.616 --> 22:08.076
relevant to Mr. Rilz.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.536
We've uncovered a pattern,

22:09.619 --> 22:12.581
clients meeting with him
for private sessions.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.709
Some of whom
may have been lured into giving him money.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.629
"Lured"? No. I wrote him a check.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.507
He wanted to start a yoga retreat,

22:22.591 --> 22:23.800
in Joshua Tree.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.929
There have been some allegations

22:28.013 --> 22:30.891
that he may
have had a physical relationship

22:30.974 --> 22:32.642
with some of his female clients.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.439
Jan was an old soul.

22:38.648 --> 22:43.236
He knew how to connect with people.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.031
It's what made him a great teacher.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.368
He could make you feel like
you were the only person in the world.

22:50.577 --> 22:51.411
But you weren't.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.998
And I knew about his other <i>investors.</i>

22:55.082 --> 22:56.666
Neema Shavar, for one…

22:56.750 --> 23:01.046
Wait. Neema Shavar,
was she another client, or…

23:02.047 --> 23:02.881
I'm sorry.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.217
What law firm
did you say you were with again?

23:06.593 --> 23:07.761
I'm so sorry.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.389
I think I'm barking
up the wrong tree here.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.851
I must've gotten some bad information.
I've taken up enough of your time.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.436
Have a great rest of your day.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.543
What?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.461
It's a bar.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.588
I can see that, yeah.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.299
Full of people you used to drink with.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.885
Yeah, my problem was with pills, Izzy.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.472
You wanna stay clean,
it's best if it's all off-limits now.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.684
Look. Jerry Vincent
gave me my career back.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.477
Least I can do is pay my respects.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.647
So, just park somewhere close
and I'll text you when I'm done.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.385
Hey. There he is. What'll you have, Mick?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.929
-I'm good, man.
-Get the man a drink!

24:33.013 --> 24:35.015
-Thanks.
-One drink. Come on.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.395
Give me a club soda
with lime, please.

24:41.813 --> 24:47.444
You know, Jerry wasn't just a great boss.
He was a great man.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.321
You know?

24:50.363 --> 24:51.698
-Yes.

25:05.003 --> 25:05.837
To Jerry.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.256
-To Jerry.
-Jerry.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.216
<i>Slainté!</i>

25:12.552 --> 25:13.970
Your turn, Mick. Speech.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.514
Speech! Speech!

25:15.597 --> 25:17.349
Who, me? You want me?

25:17.432 --> 25:19.059
-Yes, you!
-Aw, come on. Why me?

25:19.142 --> 25:20.185
Come on.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.895
You took over his practice.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.397
-He trusted you.
-Come on.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.524
All right.

25:27.984 --> 25:31.947
Well, I'm not much for speeches,
except in a courtroom.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.449
Uh…

25:36.159 --> 25:39.037
I first met Jerry
back when he was still a prosecutor.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.206
-I hear you.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.710
I guess Jerry did, too,
because, well, then he switched sides.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.588
He was kind enough to tell me

25:48.672 --> 25:51.550
that I was one of the folks
who inspired him to do that.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.804
Although, personally,
I think he just wanted the money.

25:58.515 --> 26:02.227
Now, honestly, I…
I hadn't seen Jerry in a very long time.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.272
But taking over some of his clients,

26:06.606 --> 26:10.860
it reminds me
that Jerry was like any of us.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.573
You know,
he had some big cases that paid the rent.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.411
He had some little ones that,
well, only he knows why he took 'em.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.289
But the end of the day,

26:23.373 --> 26:25.125
he just wanted to leave his clients

26:25.208 --> 26:27.627
better off
than how he found 'em. And that's…

26:29.087 --> 26:31.214
That's all any of us can do, right?

26:35.093 --> 26:36.386
So here's to Jerry.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.390
As my father used to say,

26:40.473 --> 26:43.226
"We shall not look upon his like again."

26:43.310 --> 26:46.563
-To Jerry.
-To Jerry!

26:47.230 --> 26:48.231
Excuse me.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.318
That was some good stuff, bro.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.663
Hey, that was something. Good seeing you.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.298
Counselor.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.345
Lankford. You here for Jerry?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.765
Some defense lawyer? Fat chance.

27:22.515 --> 27:26.394
No, just having drinks
with some cops after work.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.980
You know, decent people.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.650
-Ah.
-Mmm.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.696
So, McFierce…

27:38.365 --> 27:39.282
Huh.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.787
I wonder what she ever saw in you.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.375
Yeah. Well, that makes two of us.

27:51.711 --> 27:55.090
So, how's your boy doing?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.552
Jesús Menendez out in Calipatria.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.897
Well, say hi to him for me.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.819
I'll see you around, Counselor.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.761
Another club soda, boss?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.681
Give me a pint
and a shot of Herradura, please.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.015
Yeah. Okay.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.706
It's all off-limits, huh?

29:52.749 --> 29:53.875
It doesn't seem fair.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.961
Fair's got nothing to do with it.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.803
It is what it is. You know?

30:04.886 --> 30:09.057
It's like trying to turn
a pickle back into a cucumber.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.141
You're a pickle now.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.852
Yeah, I heard that in rehab.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.312
Not sure I buy it, though.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.440
Then why didn't you have those drinks?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.400
'Cause…

30:20.944 --> 30:23.404
I wanted to prove I didn't need to.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.615
And because I don't get joint custody back

30:25.698 --> 30:27.534
until I earn Maggie's trust.

30:27.617 --> 30:31.079
Yeah. I don't think it works long term
if you do it for somebody else.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.831
Yeah. I heard that in rehab, too.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.004
I saw your car.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.094
Dance studio bumper sticker.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.136
That's you, right?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.347
How'd you know that?

30:50.473 --> 30:51.766
I looked into you, too.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.228
I had to know
what I was getting myself into.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.568
You're not sleeping in your car, are you?

31:03.194 --> 31:04.195
Not anymore.

31:05.363 --> 31:09.409
I got a new place two days ago.
With all the big bucks you're paying me.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.957
I came to LA to study at that studio.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.210
It paid off.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.797
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.800
I toured all over the world
with a bunch of rich pop stars.

31:26.467 --> 31:30.096
And a bunch of drugs backstage
that I somehow managed to avoid.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.476
Until I hurt my back,
and I didn't wanna lose my job.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.981
The thing I had to figure out, though,

31:40.064 --> 31:42.233
was what pain
the drugs were really numbing.

31:44.027 --> 31:47.113
You can't recover until you know
what you're recovering from.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.243
That's the work.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.131
Come on.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.778
Hold on. You did what?

32:26.861 --> 32:29.948
Babe, you cannot
put yourself in these situations.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.824
Don't infantilize me, Cisco.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.868
-Infant-- What?
-We were up against it.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.663
You weren't answering
your phone, so I took initiative.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.790
I'm telling you,
this woman could've done it.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.875
Then she started
talking about other clients,

32:40.959 --> 32:43.252
somebody he was probably schtupping.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.921
Are you serious about this?

32:45.004 --> 32:45.922
She loved him.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.424
Then realized
he was spreading it all over town.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.135
Someone like that,
who knows what they're capable of?

32:54.013 --> 32:55.974
I make a pretty good investigator.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.142
That's not all you make.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.647
We going somewhere?

33:02.730 --> 33:03.564
We are.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.941
My driver will follow us.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.276
-I wanna take your car.
-My car?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.405
Watch your hands.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.365
Do yourself a favor.
When you come to court,

33:12.448 --> 33:14.325
just drive something else.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.452
Jury sees you in this, forget it.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.297
You gonna tell me
where we're going?

33:28.381 --> 33:30.466
-Or should I just--
-Don't worry about it.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.385
Just stay under the speed limit.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.178
It's like a ticket mill out here.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.138
Yeah.

33:38.474 --> 33:39.851
Where are the buttons here?

33:39.934 --> 33:41.853
-What do you need?
-To smell the ocean.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.105
Windows.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.780
All right. Let's talk about your case.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.284
On the prosecution side,
it's pretty circumstantial.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.287
The problem is, for a jury,
it's also pretty believable.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.831
I didn't know she was having an affair.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.916
There's one important piece of evidence.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.835
The gunshot residue on your clothes.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.754
No, that was a false positive.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.883
It had to be.
I've never fired a gun in my life.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.926
Jerry said
he could attack the test results.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.972
Which bring us to the defense case.
You and Jerry ever talk about that?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.724
He said he had something

34:19.807 --> 34:23.644
but he didn't want to tell me
until he was sure he had it locked down.

34:24.979 --> 34:27.065
We were supposed to discuss it this week.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.068
But I guess that's not gonna happen now.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.945
Why'd you wait five minutes to call 911?

34:34.197 --> 34:36.157
Because I was in shock.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.159
Then you should've
hung up and called a lawyer.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.411
So they could tell me
to keep my mouth shut?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.580
Plead the Fifth?
That's what guilty people do.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.624
No. That's what smart people do.

34:44.707 --> 34:48.503
Bullshit. The jury needs to hear
from my mouth that I'm innocent.

34:48.586 --> 34:51.881
You mean testify?
Golantz will run circles around you.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.593
And once your credibility's shot,
it won't matter what you tell the jury.

34:55.676 --> 34:56.677
There's two juries.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.679
In the courtroom,
and the Twitter mob outside.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.599
I told you,
they need to see that I'm innocent.

35:01.682 --> 35:04.227
Or our acquisition turns into a fire sale.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.770
This is non-negotiable.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.779
It's filed? You sure?

35:15.822 --> 35:17.532
Okay. Great, thanks.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.118
They just unsealed the indictment.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.037
Nice work, McFierce.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.666
What?

35:26.749 --> 35:28.251
Nothing. Just…

35:29.335 --> 35:31.963
You and Haller.
I can't wrap my head around that one.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.549
Is this gonna be a problem?

35:34.632 --> 35:35.967
No. It's not a problem.

35:36.050 --> 35:39.637
Because if you have a beef with my ex,
it's got nothing to do with me.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.683
All right, my bad.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.310
I get it. I'm divorced too.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.522
Oh, come on. What are we here?
Cagney and Lacey on a stakeout?

35:49.605 --> 35:50.940
Which one am I?

35:52.525 --> 35:55.069
I take it you two
were on opposite sides of a case?

35:56.612 --> 36:00.992
Yeah. It wasn't even my case.
I was just the supervisor on it.

36:01.075 --> 36:04.996
It was a murder. Jesús Menendez,
this guy who carved up a prostitute,

36:05.079 --> 36:06.998
and your ex pled him out.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.251
Yeah, sounds like one of his cases.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.336
<i>Eyes on the target,</i>
<i>heading out.</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:13.921
Here we go.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.845
Angelo Soto. Stop where you are.

36:20.928 --> 36:21.929
Come on.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.224
Mr. Soto, you're under arrest
for suspicion of human trafficking,

36:25.308 --> 36:27.476
Penal Code 236.1.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.228
You have the right to remain silent.

36:29.312 --> 36:32.356
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in court of law.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.078
Why the hell
did you bring me here?

36:46.954 --> 36:50.041
The DA knows
when you left your office that morning.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.126
Based on time of death, they need to prove

36:52.210 --> 36:54.712
you could've
gotten here in 40 minutes or less.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.424
Thirty-six minutes.
And that's driving the speed limit.

36:58.507 --> 37:01.928
You brought me back to the place
my wife was murdered for that?

37:02.011 --> 37:02.929
No, not just that.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.972
Take me through
the whole day of the murders.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.016
You wanna take the stand?

37:07.099 --> 37:09.310
I need to hear
exactly what you're gonna say.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.603
Start with the night before.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.693
We had a fight.

37:17.777 --> 37:18.736
About?

37:18.819 --> 37:20.529
Same thing we always fought about.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.865
My wife resented
having to live in my shadow.

37:22.949 --> 37:23.824
Do you blame her?

37:25.159 --> 37:26.494
So you went to bed angry.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.457
Yes. But I came out here
the next day to try and make up.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.709
I thought we would do
something spontaneous,

37:33.793 --> 37:35.670
maybe drive up to Big Sur…

37:35.753 --> 37:36.587
Then what?

37:37.421 --> 37:38.965
Then what? Then you know what.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.509
No, I don't.

37:42.134 --> 37:45.638
You don't get off that easy.
Now, let's go inside. Come on. Come on.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.904
What happened after you came in?

38:03.698 --> 38:05.283
I called out her name.

38:09.996 --> 38:10.871
Lara?

38:12.039 --> 38:13.249
She didn't answer.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.710
I figured she'd gone to the beach,

38:15.793 --> 38:18.337
so I went up to the bedroom
to put my swimsuit on.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.131
Lara?

38:23.050 --> 38:23.884
Okay. Let's go.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.142
-Don't make me do this.
-Come on, Trevor. Let's go.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.154
Tell me what you saw.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.204
Goddamn you.

38:53.205 --> 38:56.375
Trevor, tell me what you saw.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.344
Baby.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.849
What the fuck?

39:13.017 --> 39:13.934
He was over there.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.396
And Lara…

39:19.482 --> 39:20.691
Lara was on the bed.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.197
I found them dead. Okay?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.657
I found them both dead. They were…

39:45.591 --> 39:47.218
What about the cameras?

39:48.677 --> 39:49.804
What cameras?

39:49.887 --> 39:52.390
They were off the morning of the murders.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.393
There's no footage
of you arriving or going in.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.019
Lara must've turned them off.

39:57.103 --> 40:00.106
I guess she didn't want them
recording her and Rilz together.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.440
Makes sense.

40:01.524 --> 40:04.610
She did that every time
she was alone with Rilz, didn't she?

40:04.693 --> 40:05.653
I wouldn't know.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.321
Really?

40:07.405 --> 40:10.950
I've got a security system
at my house, too. Nothing elaborate.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.911
But I can access
the cameras from my phone anytime I want,

40:13.994 --> 40:16.789
and I'm just a simple lawyer.
You're a goddamn tech genius.

40:16.872 --> 40:19.291
You told me
you didn't know about the affair.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.877
You never asked
about the cameras being off?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.129
You never noticed this?

40:23.212 --> 40:24.088
Fuck you, Mickey.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.507
Trevor,
if I can figure this out in a few days,

40:26.590 --> 40:28.676
the prosecutor figured it out months ago.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.095
-It's not what you think.
-Then what is it?

40:33.347 --> 40:35.015
I didn't care about the affair.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.438
I mean, I cared, but…

40:41.605 --> 40:44.275
God knows I wasn't a perfect husband.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.778
Success goes to your head. I… I…

40:49.530 --> 40:52.992
I stepped outside
of my marriage, more than once.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.120
Lara forgave me for it,
at least she tried to.

40:56.203 --> 40:59.498
Now, did I like
that she's fucking another guy?

40:59.582 --> 41:02.585
No. But am I gonna
let that destroy my marriage?

41:02.668 --> 41:03.627
So, you knew.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.296
-Yes, I knew.
-And you lied about it.

41:05.379 --> 41:08.048
Because I know
how guilty it makes me look.

41:08.132 --> 41:11.594
I came out here that morning
to fight for the woman that I love.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.096
Not physically, emotionally.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.682
Mickey, I didn't kill them.

41:16.765 --> 41:19.226
I don't have it in me
to do something like that.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.815
Now, when I asked you
to walk me through your story,

41:24.899 --> 41:27.026
what happened on that day,

41:27.109 --> 41:30.488
that was your direct examination,
and you passed with flying colors.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.407
You said the right things,
you showed emotion at the right time,

41:33.491 --> 41:35.534
I believed every word and so would a jury.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.204
But just now, Trevor, that was your cross.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.080
That's how easily

41:40.164 --> 41:42.833
that fucker, Golantz,
will rip you to pieces.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.543
Do you understand this?

41:46.837 --> 41:47.922
Then we're done here.

41:54.637 --> 41:55.888
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

42:02.186 --> 42:04.980
Wait. So now we got
two other people to point the finger at?

42:05.648 --> 42:09.276
Listen, the woman
Lorna found doesn't feel likely to me.

42:10.027 --> 42:14.281
But she did bring up another
one of the yoga clients. Neema Shavar.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.493
<i>She was giving money</i>
<i>to this guy, Rilz, too.</i>

42:17.576 --> 42:19.995
And she has a husband.

42:20.079 --> 42:25.584
He runs a private security company.
The kind that cater to off-book clientele.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.753
The kind that's good at following people?

42:27.836 --> 42:32.341
I know what you're thinking, but listen,
now, all we've got is smoke, not fire.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.469
You need us to stick around tonight?

42:35.553 --> 42:38.764
No. You guys take off.
I could use the peace and quiet.

42:38.847 --> 42:42.685
Cisco, you find out anything about the guy
in the picture Griggs showed me?

42:42.768 --> 42:44.812
I couldn't get ahold of my source.

42:44.895 --> 42:45.980
He ghosted me.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.898
And Griggs never stopped by with it?

42:47.982 --> 42:48.941
<i>Not that I know.</i>

42:49.024 --> 42:52.736
But the DA
did send over a discovery on Eli Wyms.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.321
<i>I'll leave it out for you.</i>

42:54.405 --> 42:56.782
All right, thanks.
I'll get to it tomorrow.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.826
Tonight's gotta be all about Elliott.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.085
<i>Momentum's great.</i>

43:09.086 --> 43:11.046
<i>Momentum's what you want.</i>

43:11.922 --> 43:14.133
<i>But momentum can also grind to a halt.</i>

43:15.593 --> 43:18.429
<i>And then it's just you</i>
<i>facing the music alone</i>

43:18.512 --> 43:20.139
<i>with a couple of legal pads.</i>

43:24.810 --> 43:27.771
<i>First, you just lay out the basic facts.</i>

43:29.523 --> 43:32.318
But the more you think,
the more you start to dig.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.778
What are you digging for?

43:35.571 --> 43:37.615
Depends. Every case is like a puzzle.

43:37.698 --> 43:39.533
It's a code you've got to crack.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.118
<i>You've got to find the answers,</i>

43:42.286 --> 43:45.331
<i>or the magic bullet</i>
<i>that'll blow the whole thing wide open.</i>

43:51.629 --> 43:53.881
<i>Sometimes they might be</i>
<i>right in front of your face.</i>

43:56.759 --> 43:59.595
But usually, they're buried, deep down.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.180
So, you dig some more.

44:05.809 --> 44:07.811
<i>What you're looking for are connections.</i>

44:07.895 --> 44:11.523
<i>The elusive kind,</i>
<i>the kind you didn't notice at first.</i>

44:14.818 --> 44:18.614
<i>The pieces that don't fit.</i>
<i>Or the pieces that fit too easily.</i>

44:23.994 --> 44:25.996
<i>But sometimes, you move the pieces around,</i>

44:26.955 --> 44:28.123
<i>and none of it adds up.</i>

44:30.292 --> 44:32.795
That's when
you gotta stop and take a step back.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.423
Because the answer
might be right in front of your face.

45:20.968 --> 45:21.844
Shit.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.560
Eli Wyms is the magic bullet.
I don't know how, but he's got to be.

45:29.643 --> 45:32.980
He was arrested the same day
as the murders a couple of miles away.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.857
That's why Jerry wanted the case.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.943
It can't be a coincidence.
This guy knows something, Cisco.

45:38.026 --> 45:39.528
Just call me back, all right?

46:04.720 --> 46:05.554
Hey!

46:17.775 --> 46:20.068
Fuck! Come on.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.129
Get the hell out of here!

46:42.883 --> 46:44.343
Yeah! That's right!

46:48.972 --> 46:49.807
<i>Haller?</i>

46:49.890 --> 46:52.768
The guy from the photo,
I think he was just here. At the office.

46:52.851 --> 46:56.271
<i>-What?</i>
-I scared him off with a gun, I think.

46:56.355 --> 46:59.691
<i>-Fuck are you doing with a gun?</i>
-Never mind! Just get over here!

47:00.484 --> 47:01.652
<i>God damn it!</i>

47:01.735 --> 47:05.072
<i>I'll be there in ten minutes.</i>
<i>Try not to shoot me when I get there.</i>
