00:00.757 --> 00:02.375
2,000 years ago,

00:02.383 --> 00:04.078
Anthony and Cleopatra,

00:04.083 --> 00:07.756
two of the most powerful people
in the world, fell in love.

00:07.762 --> 00:10.931
Their relationship brought
civil war to the Roman Empire

00:10.937 --> 00:13.972
and an end to the
Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt.

00:14.102 --> 00:15.869
They were said to be buried together.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.318
Throughout the ages,

00:17.324 --> 00:20.107
their final resting place
has remained hidden.

00:20.174 --> 00:21.742
Until now.

00:50.781 --> 00:52.749
Doctor, this is a dead end.

00:52.755 --> 00:55.590
No, Max. This is a door.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.818
Here's where the lever
would go to open it.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.954
Wait. So your theory was right?

01:03.022 --> 01:04.656
There's only one way to find out.

01:30.744 --> 01:32.845
Light it up.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.253
What the...?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.505
There's only one of them here.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.007
It's only Antony.

01:56.013 --> 01:58.014
Dr. Castillo! Come.

01:59.988 --> 02:01.479
You see?

02:07.820 --> 02:09.670
Afrika Korps

02:09.726 --> 02:11.789
from the Nazi invasion of Egypt.

02:11.795 --> 02:13.987
So, what, they found the
secret room and got sealed in?

02:13.993 --> 02:17.107
- By who?
- It doesn't make any sense.

02:17.113 --> 02:19.748
"All those who would disturb the sacred

02:19.754 --> 02:22.301
"tomb will come to no swift death

02:22.568 --> 02:24.869
"and be cursed for all eternity."

02:29.274 --> 02:31.009
Call back to base camp.

02:31.015 --> 02:33.183
Notify the Egyptian
Ministry of our find.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.773
Stay right here.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.687
Oh.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.244
Get up.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.893
Where's the other sarcophagus?

03:13.906 --> 03:15.920
Where is Cleopatra?

03:16.190 --> 03:18.291
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

03:19.069 --> 03:20.882
Set the explosives.

03:20.888 --> 03:23.494
- No! No, you can't.
- Take her.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.994
- And deal with them.
- No! No!

03:26.000 --> 03:28.800
No! No! You can't do that! No!

03:34.740 --> 03:36.574
Aah!

04:33.763 --> 04:35.697
Danny?

04:35.703 --> 04:37.034
Yoshi.

04:37.788 --> 04:39.403
This is incredible.

04:39.471 --> 04:43.040
How do you not just stare
at this stuff all day?

04:43.108 --> 04:45.676
I appreciate you coming by,
Danny, but I'm kind of busy,

04:45.682 --> 04:47.640
- so if you want to get to the point...
- Not a problem.

04:47.646 --> 04:49.251
I just came to take the Vermeer.

04:49.257 --> 04:52.013
- I'll be out of your way.
- Dude, we talked about this.

04:52.029 --> 04:53.629
I can't just give away a Vermeer.

04:53.635 --> 04:55.493
You won't be giving it away.
You'll be giving it back

04:55.499 --> 04:57.099
to its rightful owner, my client.

04:57.105 --> 04:58.388
You know, we have provenance on this

04:58.394 --> 04:59.785
painting going back over 70 years.

04:59.791 --> 05:02.800
I have a photo of my
client with the painting.

05:03.575 --> 05:05.374
You have a photo of a little girl

05:05.380 --> 05:06.899
who could be anyone standing in front

05:06.905 --> 05:08.673
of what may or may not be our painting.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.414
Look, this photo... unlike the
rest of my client's family...

05:11.481 --> 05:13.382
Is all that made it out of Auschwitz.

05:14.911 --> 05:16.824
Okay. Fine.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.613
Let's do this. You see, the Nazis...

05:18.619 --> 05:20.132
They weren't just murderers.

05:20.138 --> 05:22.781
They were murderers who
kept meticulous records.

05:22.787 --> 05:24.529
These are manifests for art

05:24.545 --> 05:26.946
seized by Hitler's treasure
hunters in the E.R.R.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.885
Now here is an entry for the painting,

05:28.891 --> 05:30.258
as well as the family name Hoffman.

05:30.284 --> 05:32.386
The painting is then transferred
to the Jeu de Paume in Paris,

05:32.392 --> 05:33.681
where it is received
by Hermann Göring...

05:33.687 --> 05:34.911
Okay, okay, okay!

05:34.917 --> 05:36.317
Look, I'm trying to help, Danny,

05:36.323 --> 05:39.258
but this painting will sell
at auction for $30 million.

05:39.326 --> 05:41.160
Yoshi...

05:41.228 --> 05:42.962
I feel the good in you.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.330
The conflict.

05:44.398 --> 05:45.832
Sorry to interrupt, fellas.

05:45.899 --> 05:47.467
- Mr. Reece.
- Jay.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.125
I had no idea that you
were visiting us today.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.364
Actually, I need him.

05:50.370 --> 05:52.305
And I couldn't help overhearing.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.212
So, Yoshi, here's the deal.

05:54.218 --> 05:56.733
The auction house is gonna give
Danny the painting for free.

05:56.739 --> 05:58.873
In return, pick any two paintings.

05:58.879 --> 06:02.281
I'll exhibit them in my
museum for, say, six months.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.750
They'll double in value,
and you'll get to avoid all

06:04.756 --> 06:07.125
the bad PR that'll come
from his client's lawsuit,

06:07.187 --> 06:08.721
which I will pay for.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.030
That's very generous of you, Mr. Reece.

06:11.178 --> 06:12.920
I'm sure that we can find a way

06:12.926 --> 06:14.460
to accommodate you.

06:14.528 --> 06:16.796
Thank you, Yoshi. Thank you, Jay.

06:16.802 --> 06:18.359
Nothin', kid. Come
on, my ride's waiting.

06:18.365 --> 06:19.499
How's it going, Yates?

06:19.566 --> 06:20.967
Not too bad, Danny. Yourself?

06:21.034 --> 06:23.803
- Living the dream.
- Attaboy.

06:31.278 --> 06:34.247
Ana Castillo was there,
Danny, at the pyramids.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.317
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

06:38.385 --> 06:39.968
It appears she's been taken,

06:39.974 --> 06:41.938
along with her discovery.

06:42.456 --> 06:44.845
She found Antony and Cleopatra.

06:44.851 --> 06:46.665
After all these years, she found them.

06:46.671 --> 06:48.327
Whoa-oa-oa. Hold on.

06:48.395 --> 06:52.031
Dr. Castillo found Antony and Cleopatra?

06:52.099 --> 06:53.666
In the pyramids?

06:53.672 --> 06:55.106
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

06:55.112 --> 06:56.978
But she discovered evidence
that they had been moved

06:56.984 --> 06:59.605
into the pyramids hundreds of years ago.

06:59.673 --> 07:01.107
She sent me a message

07:01.175 --> 07:04.343
that she had found the tomb
right before the attack.

07:04.349 --> 07:06.282
Her body wasn't there, so I

07:06.288 --> 07:08.979
need you to help me find her.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.952
Jay, you-you know what
Dr. Castillo means to me.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.121
I want to help, but I'm...

07:15.189 --> 07:16.956
I'm not that guy anymore.

07:17.024 --> 07:18.357
You should call the FBI.

07:18.425 --> 07:20.793
Well, I would, if you
still worked there.

07:20.861 --> 07:23.262
All right, look, the best
way to find Ana is to

07:23.268 --> 07:25.169
follow the treasure to the terrorists,

07:25.299 --> 07:27.233
the same way you tracked Karim Farouk.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.873
That didn't exactly end well.

07:29.002 --> 07:30.469
Danny, there's nobody better

07:30.537 --> 07:32.805
at tracking blood antiquities than you.

07:32.811 --> 07:34.085
And I promise, you will have

07:34.091 --> 07:36.047
every dollar, every connection

07:36.109 --> 07:38.377
that is mine at your disposal.

07:38.445 --> 07:40.980
Ana does not have time
for all the red tape.

07:41.048 --> 07:43.749
She needs you to save her.

07:54.695 --> 07:56.762
You're letting me borrow your jet?

07:56.830 --> 07:58.631
One of my jets, yeah.

07:58.699 --> 08:00.666
For incidentals.

08:00.734 --> 08:03.469
You get a fix on Ana's
location, you call me.

08:03.537 --> 08:05.071
I'll send in the K&R team.

08:05.138 --> 08:08.241
Do not rush in there trying
to make up for the past.

08:08.308 --> 08:10.476
Can you call in a favor,
pull a passport for me?

08:10.544 --> 08:13.294
Yeah, give me the name, I'll
have Yates track it for you.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.745
Lexi Vaziri.

08:15.113 --> 08:17.178
Tell me you're joking.

08:17.184 --> 08:19.680
- I need her.
- Well, that's honest, at least.

08:19.686 --> 08:21.043
I need her help

08:21.049 --> 08:22.672
to find Dr. Castillo.

08:22.678 --> 08:24.824
Kid, I know how much
you love to try and save

08:24.830 --> 08:26.200
beautiful, broken things...

08:26.206 --> 08:28.461
I appreciate you trying
to look out for me, Jay,

08:28.528 --> 08:30.696
but I know what I'm doing.

08:31.659 --> 08:34.193
Safe flight, Danny.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.960
I suppose this will do.

08:56.089 --> 08:58.090
It's the best they have.

08:59.192 --> 09:03.229
So, how does a Middle Eastern
girl get an English accent?

09:03.807 --> 09:07.066
Boarding school. Briarcliff.

09:07.134 --> 09:09.468
- I went to Kerrisdale.
- Mm.

09:09.536 --> 09:11.343
Our rowing club crushed you every

09:11.349 --> 09:13.210
year at the Regatta.

09:13.273 --> 09:16.887
You cheated every year at the Regatta.

09:17.662 --> 09:19.429
Half your team was on steroids.

09:25.986 --> 09:28.054
Why are you still dressed?

09:58.743 --> 10:00.976
Hello there.

10:22.449 --> 10:23.755
Who are you?

10:23.761 --> 10:25.077
I'm his mistress.

10:25.145 --> 10:28.147
I'm his mistress!

10:44.531 --> 10:45.831
Hey!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.025
Hey!

11:12.031 --> 11:13.131
Hey.

11:13.393 --> 11:14.449
O-Okay...

11:14.677 --> 11:16.851
- You have got to be joking.
- I know you didn't...

11:16.857 --> 11:18.858
Look, I get it, but it's important.

11:18.864 --> 11:20.126
- Are you stalking me?
- No.

11:20.132 --> 11:21.628
I tracked your passport to France.

11:21.634 --> 11:23.041
A credit card hit on one of your

11:23.047 --> 11:24.603
- aliases pointed me here.
- Really?

11:24.609 --> 11:26.666
Okay, yeah, that did sound
like I was stalking you, but...

11:26.672 --> 11:28.029
Someone's in trouble,

11:28.035 --> 11:30.103
- and I need your help.
- Good old Danny McNamara.

11:30.109 --> 11:31.386
Always playing the hero no matter

11:31.392 --> 11:33.012
how many lives he ruins in the process.

11:33.018 --> 11:34.479
Have you been watching the news?

11:34.542 --> 11:35.842
Egypt?

11:35.848 --> 11:37.051
Yeah.

11:37.057 --> 11:39.713
Well, it wasn't just
terrorism, it was an art heist.

11:40.557 --> 11:43.545
The tomb of Antony and
Cleopatra was in the pyramid.

11:43.551 --> 11:45.719
You do know that the pyramids
are 2,000 years older

11:45.725 --> 11:47.626
than Antony and Cleopatra?

11:47.632 --> 11:50.525
- Mm.
- So why hasn't the news mentioned it?

11:50.531 --> 11:51.725
Only four people know.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.245
Including my mentor, Dr. Castillo,

11:54.251 --> 11:55.328
who was taken.

11:55.334 --> 11:57.400
My father always said
that tomb was cursed.

11:57.406 --> 11:59.123
I don't remember you
being superstitious.

11:59.129 --> 12:00.903
All I know is that no one
who's ever gone looking

12:00.909 --> 12:02.051
for it has come back alive.

12:02.057 --> 12:04.125
So I hope you find her, Danny.
Good luck.

12:04.131 --> 12:05.198
Okay.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.155
Fine. If that's what you want.

12:14.596 --> 12:15.730
Excusez-moi.

12:17.566 --> 12:20.001
Okay, don't do it for me.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.075
Do it to help me catch the bastards

12:22.081 --> 12:23.882
who destroyed the
symbol of your country.

12:25.524 --> 12:26.791
Why do you need me?

12:26.797 --> 12:28.554
I need someone who
thinks like a criminal...

12:28.560 --> 12:30.962
Who has access to people
and places I don't.

12:31.029 --> 12:32.630
Together, we can find Dr. Castillo

12:32.698 --> 12:34.298
much faster than I can alone.

12:34.366 --> 12:36.501
And you really think you
can get me out of this?

12:36.568 --> 12:39.303
Yeah. The Minister of
Interior owes me a favor.

12:39.309 --> 12:41.095
You mentioned something
about a finder's fee?

12:41.101 --> 12:43.369
- I don't believe I did, no.
- Nice try.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.176
The tomb of Antony
and Cleopatra would be

12:45.244 --> 12:47.145
one of the biggest finds in history.

12:47.212 --> 12:49.804
I think my efforts are worth
at least a million euros.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.811
For you, a million five.

12:51.817 --> 12:54.619
- I'm sure we can work something out.
- Good.

12:55.522 --> 12:58.751
I heard, through the grapevine,
that some Egyptian antiquities

12:58.757 --> 13:00.448
are gonna be on sale tomorrow night

13:00.454 --> 13:02.155
at a black-market bazaar in Rome.

13:02.161 --> 13:04.529
Don't know where or when,
but you could tag along.

13:04.864 --> 13:07.032
Assuming you don't slow me down.

13:07.038 --> 13:08.338
Deal.

13:08.406 --> 13:10.741
Tell me: how, exactly,
were you planning on

13:10.808 --> 13:13.744
getting to Rome while
locked behind bars?

13:16.047 --> 13:17.547
I wasn't too worried about it.

13:17.615 --> 13:18.682
Wait...

13:43.441 --> 13:47.311
Freeze. FBI. Don't move.

14:13.671 --> 14:15.716
Well, I hope you have
a good lawyer, Miss.

14:25.984 --> 14:27.977
I heard you started some

14:27.983 --> 14:30.058
international law firm.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.589
Oh. Now who's stalking who?

14:32.657 --> 14:34.191
It's a small world.

14:34.259 --> 14:36.193
Yeah, I practice international law.

14:36.261 --> 14:39.129
My "firm" is me working
out of my apartment.

14:39.197 --> 14:41.365
And knowing you, most of
your clients are pro bono,

14:41.432 --> 14:43.267
so who's footing the bill for all this?

14:43.334 --> 14:45.435
- Jay Reece.
- Ah.

14:45.503 --> 14:47.738
He was funding
Dr. Castillo's expedition.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.774
Protecting his investment. Got it.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.637
Trying to save Dr. Castillo's life.

14:51.643 --> 14:54.244
Oh, come on, he's trying
to save the treasure

14:54.312 --> 14:56.113
he spent a fortune to find.

14:56.448 --> 14:57.815
I know how rich guys think.

14:57.821 --> 14:59.021
You don't know him.

14:59.027 --> 15:01.346
Really? And how do you know Jacob Reece?

15:01.352 --> 15:04.221
It's a long story, but he's
one of the few people

15:04.227 --> 15:05.845
who have actually been there for me.

15:05.851 --> 15:07.819
Just like Dr. Castillo.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.626
She's pretty hot.

15:09.694 --> 15:12.129
Maybe he's boning her.

15:12.783 --> 15:14.818
Hey, when did you steal my phone?

15:14.824 --> 15:16.108
And how did you unlock it?

15:16.114 --> 15:18.749
It's just a helpful little tool
I picked up in Hong Kong.

15:18.755 --> 15:20.122
No one is boning...

15:20.128 --> 15:22.248
Look, is it so difficult
for you to imagine

15:22.254 --> 15:24.688
that sometimes people
just do nice things?

15:24.756 --> 15:28.059
Does he call her "Dr. Castillo,"
or does he call her "Ana"?

15:29.426 --> 15:31.493
- Aha.
- That doesn't prove anything.

15:31.505 --> 15:33.072
Old people need love, too, Danny.

15:33.078 --> 15:35.580
Look, they're more like my
parents than my actual parents.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.988
So I just don't want to
picture them that way.

15:37.994 --> 15:41.263
- Okay?
- You haven't changed... at all.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.299
What is that supposed to mean?

15:43.305 --> 15:46.007
Forget it. There's a reason
we were never gonna work.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.215
Oh. There's a thousand reasons
we were never gonna work.

16:00.383 --> 16:02.118
I've got a lead on the
black-market bazaar,

16:02.185 --> 16:03.619
but we have to make a stop first.

16:03.687 --> 16:05.287
You need a suit.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.290
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.193
Exactly the problem.

16:11.199 --> 16:12.777
You never used to mind my clothes

16:12.783 --> 16:14.184
when we were together.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.465
That's because I assumed
it was an FBI thing.

16:16.471 --> 16:18.440
Like they preferred for
you to dress, you know,

16:18.446 --> 16:19.873
- boring.
- What?

16:19.879 --> 16:21.914
The point is, rich people
dress in a way that signals

16:21.920 --> 16:23.733
to other rich people that they belong.

16:23.739 --> 16:25.808
That's why the $400 T-shirt exists.

16:25.876 --> 16:28.177
Where we're going, you will
stick out like a sore thumb,

16:28.245 --> 16:29.845
and that will get us killed.

16:29.851 --> 16:32.219
Doesn't look like a store.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.544
Oh, now you're picking a lock.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.084
- Come on!
- Danny, I think we can both agree

16:35.090 --> 16:36.424
that we obviously don't have time

16:36.430 --> 16:39.155
to buy you a suit and get it
properly tailored for tonight.

16:39.161 --> 16:40.680
So, this is my ex-boyfriend's place.

16:40.686 --> 16:42.086
You're both the same size,

16:42.092 --> 16:44.527
and he has style.

16:47.030 --> 16:49.131
Well, don't just stand there.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.663
I feel very uncomfortable
in a stolen suit.

17:20.730 --> 17:22.431
Oh, calm down. He's not gonna miss it.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.066
I'm not in the FBI anymore.

17:24.071 --> 17:27.107
You break the law, I can't protect you.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.082
Oh, I've never needed
a man to protect me.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.534
Ma.

18:07.811 --> 18:10.980
Normally, I would have shot you by now,

18:11.226 --> 18:15.263
but Mama says I need
to work on my English.

18:17.153 --> 18:20.930
Mama thinks your friend
is an Interpol agent.

18:20.936 --> 18:22.958
You're joking.

18:22.964 --> 18:25.320
He's my boy toy.
I literally got him that suit.

18:25.326 --> 18:27.249
You can't be too careful these days.

18:29.077 --> 18:30.811
I'm going to need proof

18:30.879 --> 18:32.713
you're not working for the cops.

18:32.781 --> 18:35.282
You can ask your daughter, Sophia.

18:37.506 --> 18:39.107
Your daughter is a friend.

18:39.175 --> 18:42.577
I know you haven't
spoken in a long time.

18:42.645 --> 18:45.146
You tell me what I want to know,

18:45.214 --> 18:48.269
and I can help smooth things
over between you two.

18:52.254 --> 18:54.442
I-I hear she has a little boy now.

18:55.275 --> 18:57.337
Niko, yeah.

18:58.756 --> 19:00.924
He has his grandfather's eyes.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.185
You know, I wouldn't
have minded a heads-up

19:07.191 --> 19:08.975
that we were meeting with the Mafia.

19:09.038 --> 19:11.095
I've got a friend in Interpol
who could have helped.

19:11.101 --> 19:13.141
Oh, great idea.

19:13.271 --> 19:14.971
Until your friend
tipped off the Aluzzos,

19:14.977 --> 19:16.578
then no more black-market bazaar,

19:16.645 --> 19:18.947
Antony and Cleopatra disappear,

19:19.014 --> 19:22.584
you lose Dr. Castillo and
I lose my finder's fee.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.426
Gwen Karlsson would never do that.

19:25.554 --> 19:28.256
All it takes is one bad apple.

19:28.324 --> 19:30.191
And I don't know Gwen.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.226
- Agent Karlsson.
- Captain Fabi.

19:42.505 --> 19:44.839
You do know you're supposed
to sip that, right?

19:44.907 --> 19:48.176
Why is the Carabinieri
following Danny McNamara?

19:50.613 --> 19:52.380
Come.

19:52.448 --> 19:54.382
Let's discuss this inside.

19:55.951 --> 19:57.519
McNamara is involved

19:57.525 --> 19:59.854
in the blood antiquities ring
we've been monitoring.

19:59.922 --> 20:02.824
I assume that's a joke.

20:02.892 --> 20:05.693
I don't think I've ever
heard you tell a joke, Gwen.

20:05.761 --> 20:08.363
Agent Karlsson.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.701
My apologies. Agent Karlsson.

20:11.757 --> 20:14.992
The woman with McNamara is Lexi Vaziri.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.966
She was arrested in
Monte Carlo last night.

20:16.972 --> 20:18.706
McNamara pulled strings to get her out.

20:19.046 --> 20:21.247
They arrived together
in Rome three hours ago.

20:21.455 --> 20:23.606
Coincidentally, a
dozen known traffickers

20:23.612 --> 20:25.880
have also entered Rome
in the last 48 hours.

20:25.948 --> 20:27.262
There's a black-market bazaar

20:27.268 --> 20:28.988
happening somewhere in Rome tonight.

20:29.051 --> 20:30.151
Captain Fabi,

20:30.219 --> 20:31.219
Danny does a lot of work

20:31.287 --> 20:32.921
repatriating stolen art.

20:32.988 --> 20:35.156
He's probably just investigating it.

20:35.349 --> 20:37.592
Well, why hasn't he liaised with me

20:37.598 --> 20:39.332
or anyone else at the Carabinieri?

20:39.461 --> 20:41.654
Did he reach out to anyone at Interpol?

20:42.565 --> 20:45.166
You know, I worked with Danny
when he was at the FBI.

20:45.234 --> 20:47.402
That was during the Farouk
investigation, right?

20:47.469 --> 20:49.421
The one he botched by
letting him get away?

20:49.427 --> 20:50.561
Farouk was killed.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.530
By the Egyptians, a year later.

20:52.536 --> 20:54.237
No thanks to the FBI.

20:54.243 --> 20:57.579
All because of McNamara's mistake.

20:58.127 --> 21:02.026
You know, something like that
could really change a man.

21:02.484 --> 21:04.352
You're being absurd.

21:04.802 --> 21:07.904
Danny is the most moral and
ethical person I've ever met.

21:07.958 --> 21:10.823
In that case, what is the
most ethical and moral person

21:10.829 --> 21:12.184
you've ever met doing

21:12.190 --> 21:14.629
meeting with the Aluzzo Mafia, hmm?

21:16.699 --> 21:19.200
Don't forget, Agent Karlsson,

21:19.440 --> 21:20.807
you are a guest here.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.109
This is my investigation.

21:23.177 --> 21:25.245
And this?

21:25.738 --> 21:27.366
Well, this looks like conspiracy

21:27.372 --> 21:29.102
to traffic in blood antiquities.

21:29.517 --> 21:32.118
I'm going to get a
warrant for their arrest.

21:42.319 --> 21:44.921
Are you at all concerned
that we don't know anything

21:44.989 --> 21:46.789
about what we're walking into?

21:46.857 --> 21:49.425
We know exactly what we're walking into.

21:49.431 --> 21:52.366
A black-market bazaar thrown
by dangerous criminals,

21:52.372 --> 21:54.840
attended by greedy and
unscrupulous people.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.114
Oh, so, for you, just
another Saturday night.

21:57.368 --> 21:59.302
Oh.

22:04.596 --> 22:05.996
Carlo sent me.

22:06.002 --> 22:09.145
Good. I thought we came
to the wrong place.

22:09.213 --> 22:11.948
I'm taking you the back way.

22:12.016 --> 22:13.950
Ladies first.

22:27.264 --> 22:29.165
Prego.

22:40.563 --> 22:42.082
Any problem you have with

22:42.088 --> 22:43.727
a seller is your problem.

22:43.733 --> 22:45.270
Unless it gets in the way of business.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.743
Then it becomes my problem.

22:47.084 --> 22:49.285
Don't become my problem.

23:04.035 --> 23:06.971
It's like a rich douche convention.

23:08.874 --> 23:12.444
Rue de Village by Pissarro.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.546
It-it disappeared in 1938.

23:16.614 --> 23:20.300
This statue from the
13th century was stolen

23:20.340 --> 23:22.108
from the temple complex in Jaipur.

23:22.175 --> 23:24.110
- This is incredible.
- Hmm.

23:25.479 --> 23:26.879
Art.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.882
It's just another version
of the $400 T-shirt.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.017
Oh, come on.

23:32.595 --> 23:34.036
You look at a van Gogh,

23:34.042 --> 23:35.349
you're seeing the universe

23:35.355 --> 23:37.022
through the eyes of a mad genius.

23:37.090 --> 23:40.092
These... these objects have value

23:40.098 --> 23:42.699
because they connect
us with our past, and...

23:42.829 --> 23:44.196
... reflect who we are.

23:44.264 --> 23:46.580
Oh, come on.

23:47.049 --> 23:49.468
You can't possibly be that naive.

23:49.536 --> 23:52.905
Danny, I know these people.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.801
They'd come from all over the world

23:54.807 --> 23:56.514
to visit my father's shop.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.577
He was like you, you know?

23:58.645 --> 24:00.412
Every artifact had its own history.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.415
He had the same lights in his
eyes when he talked about it,

24:03.483 --> 24:05.151
but all they cared about was which house

24:05.157 --> 24:08.493
something would go into,
how the color would match the...

24:09.523 --> 24:12.491
Huh. Egyptian artifacts.

24:12.497 --> 24:14.050
Depictions of Antony and Cleopatra.

24:14.056 --> 24:15.623
It must be from their tomb.

24:15.629 --> 24:17.163
Wow.

24:17.230 --> 24:20.166
If the tomb was intact
when Dr. Castillo found it,

24:20.233 --> 24:22.067
there should be a lot more stuff here.

24:22.204 --> 24:24.801
Yeah, like, where are
Antony and Cleopatra?

24:25.698 --> 24:28.333
Oh. That's Aiden Shaw.

24:28.354 --> 24:29.544
I read his file.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.366
Thought he was an arms dealer.

24:31.372 --> 24:33.126
Well, these days, the treasure business

24:33.132 --> 24:34.799
can be as lucrative as selling guns.

24:35.148 --> 24:36.615
Looks like he's diversified.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.617
Yeah, but he's just a middleman.

24:38.623 --> 24:40.160
No way he could've pulled off

24:40.166 --> 24:41.804
the attack at the pyramid.

24:42.088 --> 24:44.356
We need to find out who hired him.

24:44.424 --> 24:46.358
Interpol can get the data off his phone.

24:46.364 --> 24:49.555
No. We can get the data off his phone.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.531
Give me a bump into him,
I'll get his phone to you,

24:52.537 --> 24:54.469
and put it back before he
even notices it was gone.

24:54.475 --> 24:56.849
- I don't think... I don't think...
- Oh, and don't make your move

24:56.855 --> 24:59.460
- until he takes the phone out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:00.978 --> 25:04.507
Your Egyptian collection
is extraordinary.

25:04.616 --> 25:06.178
Late Ptolemaic era?

25:06.246 --> 25:09.548
It's not the only extraordinary
thing here tonight.

25:10.154 --> 25:11.431
Shaw.

25:11.475 --> 25:12.776
Aiden Shaw.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.857
Enchanted.

25:15.622 --> 25:17.823
Don't I know you?

25:19.202 --> 25:20.702
Simon.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.245
Simon Hardwick.

25:22.269 --> 25:24.203
S-Swear we've met. Have we?

25:24.271 --> 25:26.873
- I just have one of those faces.
- Oh, right.

25:26.940 --> 25:28.374
What's your game?

25:28.442 --> 25:30.376
What, are you a buyer?
You a seller? You...

25:30.444 --> 25:32.776
Oh, uh, uh, appraisal, mostly.

25:34.579 --> 25:36.449
Had my eye on her as well.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.174
Procurement's my expertise.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.882
You know, I, um, I
get things for people.

25:40.888 --> 25:43.723
Hard to get, high-value things.

25:44.119 --> 25:47.287
Guys like us should
really stick together...

25:48.139 --> 25:49.639
... Special Agent McNamara.

25:50.553 --> 25:52.698
Yeah, it took me a while to place you.

25:52.766 --> 25:54.534
I was out of my element
the last time we met.

25:54.540 --> 25:55.859
You were certainly in yours.

25:55.865 --> 25:58.733
I'm, uh, just a civilian now.

25:58.739 --> 25:59.981
Yeah, of course, of course.

25:59.987 --> 26:01.469
I mean, don't worry.

26:01.475 --> 26:03.376
I'll keep your secret.

26:03.444 --> 26:05.812
Now you owe me one.

26:10.379 --> 26:12.960
These are from a
recently unearthed tomb.

26:12.966 --> 26:14.009
Oh.

26:14.015 --> 26:16.250
Have you ever heard
of Antony and Cleopatra?

26:16.256 --> 26:19.225
Wow. I was looking for something
a little more elegant,

26:19.231 --> 26:21.532
a little less cursed.

26:21.662 --> 26:23.930
Well, I'm not the superstitious type.

26:23.997 --> 26:26.032
But if these aren't your style,

26:26.100 --> 26:28.534
I do have a few other, larger items

26:28.602 --> 26:30.603
that are not on display.

26:30.609 --> 26:31.776
Hmm.

26:31.782 --> 26:34.217
The collection is extensive.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.195
Let me know when something...

26:37.384 --> 26:39.151
... catches your fancy.

26:39.157 --> 26:40.524
Lovely.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.177
You know, on second thought,

26:43.183 --> 26:46.519
maybe I will go with one of these.

26:46.587 --> 26:49.722
Antony and Cleopatra does
say "bedroom," doesn't it?

26:50.258 --> 26:52.588
Exactly what I've been thinking.

26:54.099 --> 26:56.834
- God...
- Oh! I am so, so sorry.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.398
Ah... Honest mistake. I was
distracted by the Degas.

26:59.404 --> 27:01.806
You have done quite enough, thank you.

27:02.961 --> 27:04.919
Thank you. Sorry.

27:19.219 --> 27:20.653
Where were we?

27:20.721 --> 27:22.288
Getting to know each other.

27:22.356 --> 27:24.957
In fact, I have a question for you.

27:27.361 --> 27:28.728
Who do you work for?

27:31.099 --> 27:33.453
How did you get a gun in here?

27:34.678 --> 27:37.737
That is not what you should
be worried about right now.

27:38.975 --> 27:42.108
You and I are going to go
someplace private to talk.

27:42.176 --> 27:44.277
Pack it up. We're leaving, now.

27:55.661 --> 27:57.362
Polizia!

27:58.864 --> 28:01.224
Nobody move!

28:31.858 --> 28:34.126
Danny!

28:34.194 --> 28:36.996
Gwen. Hey. How's it going?

28:37.064 --> 28:38.331
What are you doing here?

28:38.398 --> 28:40.533
Oh, I, uh, I... you know...

28:40.601 --> 28:42.568
... it's funny, actually...

28:45.315 --> 28:47.401
You know, I should really
let you get back to it.

28:47.407 --> 28:48.741
You're doing good work.

28:58.908 --> 29:02.511
Now, for the last time,
who do you work for?

29:02.517 --> 29:04.552
She works for me.

29:07.294 --> 29:10.029
I don't work for you.

29:10.097 --> 29:11.864
You're welcome.

29:11.932 --> 29:14.233
Huh. Took you long enough.

29:14.301 --> 29:17.503
It was kind of chaotic in there.

29:17.571 --> 29:19.121
And perfect timing for Interpol

29:19.127 --> 29:20.422
to show up, don't you think?

29:20.428 --> 29:21.440
Yes.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.943
- I texted Gwen.
- Oh, I knew it.

29:23.949 --> 29:25.339
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

29:25.345 --> 29:26.712
You had to call the police,

29:26.718 --> 29:29.113
because you're so
unbelievably predictable.

29:29.119 --> 29:31.050
We're lucky they were close by.

29:31.056 --> 29:32.656
- You needed the help.
- Help?

29:32.662 --> 29:33.996
I was handling it.

29:34.002 --> 29:36.422
Now the Mob knows we
tipped off the authorities.

29:36.428 --> 29:38.654
I sent the text from Shaw's phone.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.498
Huh.

29:42.362 --> 29:45.364
Was Gwen the Victoria's Secret
model with the shotgun?

29:45.370 --> 29:48.522
She may have done some modeling
to put herself through school.

29:48.528 --> 29:49.928
Huh.

29:53.373 --> 29:55.321
What... hey.

29:56.510 --> 29:58.878
Lexi? What... What are you doing?

29:58.945 --> 30:01.379
Oh, no!

30:02.487 --> 30:04.059
You got to be kidding me.

30:04.659 --> 30:05.992
Oh, my...

30:09.473 --> 30:10.925
Okay.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.559
I need you to tie Shaw up,

30:13.627 --> 30:16.329
get him in the trunk while
I hot-wire this thing.

30:16.396 --> 30:17.797
What?

30:17.803 --> 30:19.170
I'm wearing a stolen suit,

30:19.176 --> 30:21.110
colluding with the Mob

30:21.116 --> 30:23.230
and now we've moved on to
grand theft auto and kidnapping?

30:23.236 --> 30:24.904
Well, you're the one who came to me,

30:24.971 --> 30:27.139
the criminal, remember?

30:27.145 --> 30:28.703
Now, do you want to stay
here and get arrested

30:28.709 --> 30:31.017
or get in the damn car and
save your friend Castillo?

30:33.222 --> 30:36.291
Fine. But I'm leaving a note.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.114
Reza Vaziri?

30:49.182 --> 30:51.050
Agent Daniel McNamara.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.619
FBI. Do you have a minute?

30:53.687 --> 30:55.254
What is this about?

31:00.794 --> 31:02.695
Be better if we came in, sir.

31:02.762 --> 31:04.773
There is nothing to say, sir.

31:05.591 --> 31:07.240
She made it clear years ago,

31:07.246 --> 31:09.136
this is the life she wanted for herself

31:09.136 --> 31:11.538
and I am done trying to
keep her out of jail.

31:11.605 --> 31:14.908
I understand, sir, but
this is a sensitive matter.

31:14.975 --> 31:16.743
We can't talk in the street.

31:17.419 --> 31:18.529
Baba,

31:18.535 --> 31:21.471
can we please come in?

31:32.350 --> 31:34.184
You have every right to be mad at me.

31:34.190 --> 31:35.557
- I never listened.
- You never...

31:35.563 --> 31:37.120
- You...
- Always getting into trouble.

31:37.126 --> 31:38.735
Stop saying things I want to say.

31:38.741 --> 31:40.776
I'm just trying to
show you I understand.

31:41.001 --> 31:42.274
And that this time

31:42.280 --> 31:44.255
it's different, I promise.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.990
I'm trying to do something good.

31:46.206 --> 31:48.675
I mean, I-I did do something bad,

31:48.742 --> 31:52.245
but I'm doing something
good now if you'll help me.

31:52.755 --> 31:54.479
What is it?

31:55.023 --> 31:58.725
The FBI, they want to
use your antique shop

31:58.731 --> 32:00.662
to set up a sting operation

32:00.897 --> 32:02.406
on Karim Farouk.

32:03.244 --> 32:04.824
The terrorist?

32:04.830 --> 32:06.898
We can stop him.

32:07.027 --> 32:08.995
I get a chance to start over.

32:09.063 --> 32:11.531
A clean slate, you and me.

32:15.736 --> 32:17.255
Please.

32:17.605 --> 32:19.172
I will hear this man out.

32:19.239 --> 32:20.974
Thank you.

32:42.596 --> 32:43.997
Farouk is on the line.

32:44.064 --> 32:45.915
Operation is a go.

32:46.934 --> 32:49.702
Predator 138, move to
quadrant Echo Charlie.

32:50.277 --> 32:52.433
Stand by for holding and confirmation.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.253
Farouk's location is confirmed.

33:06.259 --> 33:07.493
Middle vehicle.

33:09.610 --> 33:11.090
Tell the task force they're a go.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.201
Keep talking.

33:18.249 --> 33:19.827
What happens now?

33:19.833 --> 33:22.835
Well, while your dad
keeps Farouk on the line,

33:22.903 --> 33:24.837
a Blackhawk full of FBI agents

33:24.905 --> 33:27.040
and Asim's Egyptian
Commandos is on its way.

33:27.107 --> 33:29.042
They'll stop the car
with a bullet through

33:29.109 --> 33:31.411
the engine block, the
team fast ropes down,

33:31.673 --> 33:33.140
arrests Farouk.

33:35.749 --> 33:37.050
30 seconds to target.

33:42.956 --> 33:44.924
Target has deviated
from his current route.

33:44.992 --> 33:47.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:48.601 --> 33:50.203
It can't be.

33:50.631 --> 33:52.211
It's like he knows we are coming.

33:52.688 --> 33:55.535
Target just crossed over
the border into Libya.

33:55.602 --> 33:58.371
Damn!

34:00.612 --> 34:01.969
We have to break off pursuit.

34:01.975 --> 34:03.776
Wait, why?

34:03.782 --> 34:05.432
We have been hunting
Farouk for six months.

34:05.438 --> 34:07.161
- Now we have him.
- We have no jurisdictional

34:07.167 --> 34:09.186
agreement to operate in Libya.

34:09.301 --> 34:11.121
I can have two Egyptian Ari

34:11.128 --> 34:13.224
Force MIGs on station in 90 seconds.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.455
- We can call in an air strike.
- That's...

34:15.460 --> 34:17.452
That's an act of war.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.292
He has killed hundreds of my people.

34:19.359 --> 34:20.827
Yours, too.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.395
We are already at war.

34:22.463 --> 34:24.429
You launch a missile
that close to the market

34:24.436 --> 34:27.338
and miss, we'll kill a
hundred more innocent people.

34:27.344 --> 34:29.668
I am in charge of the Egyptian
end of this operation.

34:29.987 --> 34:31.737
I don't need your permission.

34:31.804 --> 34:34.474
Asim, we'll get another chance at him.

34:37.710 --> 34:40.012
Do not engage. Do not engage.

34:40.018 --> 34:41.686
He hang up with me.

34:41.692 --> 34:43.706
Farouk suspected something.

34:44.985 --> 34:45.985
Danny?

34:48.219 --> 34:49.887
I hope you're right.

34:50.056 --> 34:51.524
For his sake.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.292
Danny.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.293
It's gonna be okay.

34:55.362 --> 34:57.471
We're gonna get this guy.

34:57.477 --> 34:59.098
And we'll keep you safe.

35:43.710 --> 35:45.845
Believe in curses now?

35:45.913 --> 35:47.346
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

35:47.414 --> 35:49.315
Does this look like a police station?

35:49.383 --> 35:50.817
We know you're selling the treasure

35:50.884 --> 35:52.318
for whoever bombed the pyramid.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.210
You're gonna tell us
who you're working for.

35:54.216 --> 35:57.051
I have nothing to say to either of you.

35:57.596 --> 35:59.754
What are you doing?

35:59.760 --> 36:00.993
I'm gonna stick this in your knee.

36:00.999 --> 36:02.623
See if that gets you talking.

36:02.629 --> 36:03.966
Torture doesn't work.

36:03.972 --> 36:05.376
Oh, I'm willing to roll the dice.

36:05.382 --> 36:07.338
He's gonna say anything
to get you to stop.

36:07.401 --> 36:09.535
It's not gonna help
us find Dr. Castillo.

36:09.603 --> 36:12.405
You haven't learned a
damn thing since Farouk.

36:12.534 --> 36:14.836
What does Farouk have to do with this?

36:14.842 --> 36:16.242
You let him get away.

36:16.248 --> 36:17.615
I didn't have a choice.

36:17.744 --> 36:19.679
Thank God the Egyptians killed him

36:19.746 --> 36:21.714
because you're so great at tracking down

36:21.720 --> 36:23.287
the bad guys, but you refuse to do

36:23.293 --> 36:24.784
what you have to do to stop them.

36:25.398 --> 36:26.931
Hey.

36:31.358 --> 36:32.792
Interesting.

36:32.798 --> 36:35.366
I reached out to my friend in the SAS.

36:35.495 --> 36:38.197
Aiden Shaw's convoy was hit by

36:38.265 --> 36:40.533
a roadside bomb in Tikrit in 2010

36:40.601 --> 36:43.202
on the same day an
American contractor named

36:43.270 --> 36:46.038
Dwayne Coleman disappeared.

36:46.774 --> 36:48.909
Looks a lot like you.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.043
You stole a dead man's identity...

36:51.111 --> 36:53.312
Dwayne.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.815
So... you're a forgery

36:55.821 --> 36:57.154
of a bad-ass.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.863
Suddenly you make a lot more sense.

36:58.869 --> 37:00.790
I saw a business opportunity.

37:00.796 --> 37:02.259
And I made it work.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.619
Don't think I'm a bad-ass?
Go ahead, try me.

37:04.625 --> 37:06.292
Is Dr. Castillo alive?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.261
I-I have no idea who that is.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.390
Then who hired you?

37:09.396 --> 37:10.558
I never met him.

37:10.564 --> 37:11.998
I get instructions via text

37:12.004 --> 37:14.161
- and paid through middlemen.
- Feel free to tag me in.

37:14.167 --> 37:16.669
Look, my partners grabbed all the loot.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.971
If I don't return it, I'm dead.

37:19.039 --> 37:21.340
If I return everything
to the guys who hired me,

37:21.408 --> 37:23.009
they'll still pay me half my fee.

37:23.076 --> 37:24.944
- How?
- When I reach out to them

37:24.950 --> 37:26.884
with an authentication code,

37:26.890 --> 37:28.824
they'll give me a rendezvous point.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.750
I'll send it to you.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.818
Mm, it's a nice try.

37:32.886 --> 37:34.654
You're gonna reach out to them now.

37:37.848 --> 37:39.482
This is how I make my living.

37:39.488 --> 37:42.223
I don't ask you to do
whatever it is you do for free.

37:43.730 --> 37:45.173
How much?

37:45.179 --> 37:47.099
Uh, making enemies is expensive.

37:47.167 --> 37:48.301
Oh, my God.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.614
I'll need a new identity,
there's moving costs, I may never

37:50.620 --> 37:52.928
get to see my favorite bar
again, that's a hard thing...

37:52.934 --> 37:54.735
Please, please let me stab him.

37:55.352 --> 37:57.176
Let's call it $2 million.

37:59.012 --> 38:01.213
All right. I need to make a phone call.

38:01.281 --> 38:03.222
Keep an eye on him.

38:03.228 --> 38:05.279
Wait, wait, wait. Man, where you going?

38:05.285 --> 38:06.714
- Don't leave me here with her.
- Oh.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.521
Hold on now, hey, hey.

38:08.588 --> 38:10.156
Hey, hey.

38:10.223 --> 38:12.358
Hi, where are you?

38:12.426 --> 38:13.960
Just outside of Rome.

38:14.430 --> 38:17.363
I think we're close to
finding Dr. Castillo.

38:17.431 --> 38:19.899
But I need some more money
to pay off an arms dealer

38:19.967 --> 38:21.534
who is acting as a middleman.

38:21.601 --> 38:23.336
He wants $2 million.

38:23.403 --> 38:25.004
You trust him?

38:25.010 --> 38:26.343
Trust?

38:26.473 --> 38:29.141
No, but... I'm all out of options.

38:29.209 --> 38:31.744
All right, fine. U-Uh, text me
the account information.

38:31.812 --> 38:33.746
Yeah, will do.

38:36.616 --> 38:38.684
Okay, I got the money.

38:39.369 --> 38:40.418
Wait.

38:40.424 --> 38:42.191
What?

38:44.558 --> 38:47.760
You let Shaw go.

38:47.828 --> 38:49.996
And you gave him the car.

38:50.063 --> 38:52.531
I did do that, yeah.

38:52.599 --> 38:55.067
But I kept your shield.

39:07.456 --> 39:10.325
If anything's missing, just let me know.

39:10.393 --> 39:12.994
So I'm a New Yorker now?

39:13.062 --> 39:14.732
Yep.

39:14.738 --> 39:16.939
- Screw you!
- Dad.

39:17.233 --> 39:18.867
Sorry. I'm trying it out.

39:18.873 --> 39:20.430
- You're a natural.
- Oh.

39:20.436 --> 39:23.004
Hey, careful with that.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.917
Thank you, Danny.

39:29.984 --> 39:32.586
Well, as long as Farouk is out there,

39:32.654 --> 39:34.054
Egypt isn't safe for you.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.908
It's the least we can do.

39:35.914 --> 39:37.345
I mean, thank you

39:37.351 --> 39:39.786
for what you have done for my daughter.

39:40.128 --> 39:42.930
Lexi has not always been easy.

39:42.997 --> 39:45.399
She lost her mom when
she was younger, and...

39:45.467 --> 39:48.902
I think she has been rebelling
against God ever since.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.773
Despite the circumstances of
how you came into her life,

39:52.841 --> 39:55.242
it's been a very good thing for her.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.612
- It's not like that.
- I see...

39:58.618 --> 40:00.385
How you look at each other.

40:00.406 --> 40:02.006
- Hmm?
- Okay.

40:02.012 --> 40:03.313
Come on.

40:03.319 --> 40:05.085
Got to meet the broker in ten minutes.

40:05.091 --> 40:06.691
Going apartment hunting.

40:06.697 --> 40:08.832
I'll see you at dinner.

40:24.372 --> 40:26.306
Your dad knows about us.

40:26.374 --> 40:28.008
That gonna be a problem for you?

40:28.076 --> 40:30.244
Not as long as he doesn't tell the FBI.

40:32.211 --> 40:34.348
I think your secret's safe.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.506
Lexi.

41:04.056 --> 41:06.091
No, no.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.409
Dad!

41:07.415 --> 41:10.217
Dad... Dad, no!

41:12.120 --> 41:13.720
No.

41:13.726 --> 41:15.201
I trusted you.

41:15.207 --> 41:16.841
You said you'd protect us,

41:16.847 --> 41:18.792
and I trusted you.

41:19.574 --> 41:21.508
I trusted you.

41:34.609 --> 41:36.143
What, what was this?

41:37.026 --> 41:38.645
Revenge?

41:38.713 --> 41:40.514
For what happened to your father?

41:41.017 --> 41:42.517
You don't think I've replayed

41:42.523 --> 41:44.613
every moment in my head over and over?

41:44.619 --> 41:47.087
I was certain they'd get
Farouk another way.

41:47.155 --> 41:48.355
I was wrong.

41:50.596 --> 41:52.397
I found...

41:52.403 --> 41:55.429
... your father's prayer beads
in the debris from the shop.

41:56.436 --> 41:59.199
I've carried them with
me every day since.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.723
Keep them.

42:23.869 --> 42:26.478
I spent two years

42:26.484 --> 42:28.449
hating you.

42:28.949 --> 42:31.765
Only because it was easier
than hating myself.

42:38.106 --> 42:39.709
I told Shaw

42:40.134 --> 42:42.814
you worked for the government,

42:42.877 --> 42:45.112
and that he was going to go
to prison if he didn't run.

42:45.241 --> 42:48.644
I said I'd stall you for
a small cut of his profits.

42:48.650 --> 42:49.953
If he thinks he's safe,

42:49.959 --> 42:51.657
he'll lead us right to them.

42:51.719 --> 42:53.553
What... How? Wh...

42:53.621 --> 42:55.656
Fun fact.

42:55.723 --> 42:58.291
This little gadget doesn't
just unlock the phone.

42:58.359 --> 43:01.278
It replaces maps app with
an identical program,

43:01.284 --> 43:03.219
only mine has a geo tracker

43:03.225 --> 43:05.599
that pings me every time
it changes location.

43:06.201 --> 43:09.242
Right now, he's heading
south on Via Del Mare.

43:09.399 --> 43:11.078
I'm just giving him
enough of a head start

43:11.084 --> 43:12.639
so he doesn't know we're following him.

43:12.645 --> 43:13.991
You knew you were gonna do this

43:14.116 --> 43:15.504
when I went to make that call.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.170
You don't get a guy like Shaw

43:17.176 --> 43:19.811
to do something by giving him
what he wants.

43:20.074 --> 43:22.311
You make him think
he's getting one over on you.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.852
Face it. It's why you needed me, Danny.

43:25.858 --> 43:27.292
You knew I would force you

43:27.298 --> 43:29.532
to do whatever it took
to get Castillo back.

43:31.020 --> 43:33.293
All right. Let's go get him.

45:19.815 --> 45:22.850
Allah! Allah!

46:34.632 --> 46:35.732
We are too late.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.000
Cleopatra is gone.

46:37.067 --> 46:38.301
She is on the truck.

46:38.369 --> 46:40.136
We need to find her now.

46:43.847 --> 46:45.387
Seal them in.

46:45.487 --> 46:48.015
They will serve in the afterlife.

46:53.132 --> 46:54.250
Please.

47:00.124 --> 47:01.491
No!

47:14.720 --> 47:16.493
What happened in Rome?

47:16.499 --> 47:18.818
Things got complicated.

47:19.966 --> 47:21.669
Did you bring the originals?

47:22.246 --> 47:24.113
Of course.

47:24.181 --> 47:26.583
You think I'd try to
fool you with copies?

47:26.650 --> 47:29.786
My men are unloading the
bigger pieces as we speak.

47:29.854 --> 47:31.047
I hope so.

47:31.053 --> 47:32.961
For your sake.

47:53.777 --> 47:55.445
Easy there.

48:04.595 --> 48:07.724
My sincere apologies about
the complications in Rome.

48:08.232 --> 48:11.456
Dr. Castillo, confirm the
authenticity of the pieces.

48:11.935 --> 48:13.417
Sorry I wasn't able to fence

48:13.423 --> 48:15.169
more of the Egyptian artifacts.

48:15.403 --> 48:17.438
If anything is wrong, you're a dead man.

48:19.403 --> 48:23.339
Mr. McNamara... welcome
to the Janus Freeport.

48:23.407 --> 48:25.441
I am the director, Rory Müller.

48:25.447 --> 48:26.738
It's very nice to meet you.

48:26.744 --> 48:29.679
This is my executive assistant.

48:29.747 --> 48:32.982
- Pleasure.
- Please. The pleasure is all mine.

48:33.050 --> 48:34.684
Any friends of Mr. Reece...

48:34.752 --> 48:36.152
Well, he's still old school.

48:36.220 --> 48:38.288
Isn't quite sold on using a free port.

48:38.355 --> 48:42.025
Actually, the concept of
a free port is not a new one.

48:42.092 --> 48:43.819
They used to be simple shacks

48:43.825 --> 48:45.433
where items could be held

48:45.439 --> 48:47.763
during stops over long voyages

48:47.769 --> 48:49.198
to avoid paying taxes.

48:49.266 --> 48:52.635
Only the shack has gotten much nicer.

48:52.703 --> 48:55.171
Please, follow me.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.180
After what happened in Egypt,

48:59.186 --> 49:00.505
Mr. Reece is looking

49:00.511 --> 49:02.812
for something absolutely secure.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.615
Think of us like a Swiss bank,

49:05.683 --> 49:09.018
full of tiny Swiss banks.

49:09.086 --> 49:11.461
I'd love to see your ops center.

49:11.789 --> 49:15.325
It is normally off-limits
to our clients.

49:15.680 --> 49:18.749
But for Mr. Reece, we'd
be happy to oblige.

49:20.767 --> 49:23.869
- It's all authentic.
- Excellent.

49:23.875 --> 49:27.303
I'll just take my payment
and be on my way.

49:36.683 --> 49:39.682
The-the people that kidnapped
you, what did they look like?

49:39.750 --> 49:41.637
He's nothing special.

49:41.643 --> 49:42.991
She's exotic.

49:43.388 --> 49:45.823
Hair like a model in
a shampoo commercial.

49:49.800 --> 49:52.495
Yes. That's her.

49:56.404 --> 49:58.271
The two people that let you go...

49:58.402 --> 50:01.170
Just showed up at the
front of this building.

50:01.238 --> 50:02.605
You led them right to us.

50:05.142 --> 50:07.502
Crate up the sarcophagus.

50:07.508 --> 50:09.078
Leave the rest.

50:09.146 --> 50:10.947
- Chain her up.
- Oh, God!

50:11.015 --> 50:12.406
Ah!

50:13.794 --> 50:15.227
Ow...

50:16.453 --> 50:18.230
I need to slow them down.

50:22.395 --> 50:26.295
There's constant
surveillance, 24 hours a day,

50:26.363 --> 50:30.133
as well as a video record of
all entries into the vaults.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.869
Do you mind if my girl

50:32.875 --> 50:35.577
- takes notes for Mr. Reece?
- Of course not.

50:35.583 --> 50:38.700
By all means. Are there cameras
inside the vaults as well?

50:38.706 --> 50:39.924
Oh, no.

50:39.930 --> 50:43.379
The only compromise we
make for total privacy

50:43.447 --> 50:45.843
is the safety system, which can

50:45.849 --> 50:48.322
sense a fire and extinguish it

50:48.385 --> 50:50.420
without harm to property.

50:50.487 --> 50:51.766
Is there any concern

50:51.772 --> 50:53.428
about someone hacking the system,

50:53.490 --> 50:55.792
- accessing the video?
- Absolutely not.

50:56.436 --> 50:59.295
It's a closed loop CCTV system.

50:59.301 --> 51:01.902
Completely unhackable.

51:01.908 --> 51:04.896
The only way to access this feed is

51:04.902 --> 51:07.170
from inside this room here.

51:07.237 --> 51:09.906
And that would be quite a feat.

51:10.401 --> 51:12.069
Well, Rory,

51:12.075 --> 51:13.945
I'm impressed. Lexi?

51:13.951 --> 51:16.112
Oh, I've got everything I need.

51:19.318 --> 51:21.412
Ah, excuse me, sir.

51:21.884 --> 51:24.454
It's a very important message
that needs your attention.

51:24.847 --> 51:27.318
Yeah... Rory? Give us a minute.

51:27.324 --> 51:30.159
Meet you upstairs.
We can talk some numbers.

51:35.332 --> 51:37.600
- Yeah?
- Danny...

51:37.668 --> 51:39.102
Is this...

51:39.169 --> 51:41.771
Dr. Castillo. We found her.

51:41.839 --> 51:43.629
- Can you pull up another angle?
- Mm-hmm.

51:43.635 --> 51:45.360
See where they took her?

51:45.366 --> 51:46.700
One level down,

51:46.706 --> 51:49.841
vault 22, looks like, she's...

51:54.258 --> 51:56.886
That's... Farouk.

51:58.336 --> 52:00.493
You told me they killed him!

52:00.499 --> 52:02.099
Lexi!

52:05.295 --> 52:06.629
Lexi!

52:06.697 --> 52:08.131
Lexi!

52:11.947 --> 52:13.814
Lexi!

52:15.139 --> 52:16.434
Lexi!

52:19.947 --> 52:22.329
- Danny!
- Hey. Thank God.

52:22.335 --> 52:23.568
Are you okay?

52:23.574 --> 52:25.414
Y-Yeah, yeah. Just get me out of here.

52:27.475 --> 52:29.409
"Bulletproof," my ass.

52:29.477 --> 52:32.412
Damn vest was supposed
to be state of the art.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.015
Does it look like state
of the art to you? Oh...

52:35.083 --> 52:37.751
This seems like a lot of blood.

52:45.293 --> 52:47.227
Damn it.

52:58.706 --> 53:00.640
Smoke?

53:04.134 --> 53:06.235
- Warning.
- Okay.

53:06.241 --> 53:07.809
Fire mitigation activated.

53:07.815 --> 53:09.716
Exit all vaults.

53:09.784 --> 53:11.885
Lot of wood in there, man.
You got to put that out.

53:11.953 --> 53:13.887
Yeah, the system's
gonna put the fire out.

53:13.955 --> 53:16.156
- Oh, good.
- But when it does that,

53:16.162 --> 53:18.704
it's gonna suck all the oxygen
out of the room and kill us.

53:18.710 --> 53:20.889
Man, you should've
started with that part.

53:20.895 --> 53:23.627
Warning. Vault door
closing in ten seconds.

53:23.633 --> 53:26.166
- Exit all vaults.
- Here, help me with her.

53:29.070 --> 53:31.405
- No, no, no, no.
- Help! Help! Help!

53:31.472 --> 53:33.907
Oxygen depletion sequence
will begin in 60 seconds.

53:33.975 --> 53:36.592
This door's locked from
the outside. We're trapped.

53:36.598 --> 53:38.612
I've got an idea.

53:39.032 --> 53:40.333
I can do it.

53:40.339 --> 53:41.845
It's not the first time I've been shot.

53:41.851 --> 53:43.169
Shouldn't we be trying to call somebody

53:43.175 --> 53:45.309
or find a button that opens the doors?

53:45.315 --> 53:47.650
There's no time, and no way to stop it.

53:49.741 --> 53:51.075
Mummies?

53:51.080 --> 53:52.535
Inside this, we'll have an air pocket

53:52.541 --> 53:54.008
to survive, until the fire's out

53:54.014 --> 53:55.348
and the oxygen's turned back on.

53:55.354 --> 53:57.040
Are you insane? I'm
not getting in there.

53:57.046 --> 53:58.179
There could be some kind of bacteria

53:58.185 --> 53:59.530
or something that could kill us.

53:59.536 --> 54:01.237
Toxic mold, actually.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.572
Lord Carnarvon

54:02.578 --> 54:04.102
is said to have died because of it

54:04.108 --> 54:05.949
- after opening King Tut's tomb.
- Okay.

54:05.955 --> 54:07.910
Thus, the speculation of the curse.

54:07.978 --> 54:09.145
Shaw!

54:09.213 --> 54:10.802
Live in here or die out there.

54:10.808 --> 54:11.981
Your choice.

54:11.987 --> 54:13.788
Oxygen depletion sequence will begin

54:13.794 --> 54:16.463
in ten, nine,

54:16.469 --> 54:19.070
- eight, seven, six...
- Scoot over.

54:19.076 --> 54:22.678
Five... oxygen depletion
sequence activated.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.034
Uh, I think this one just moved.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.375
Nothing moved, Shaw.

54:33.381 --> 54:35.346
Just breathe.

54:36.516 --> 54:39.351
I-I'm gonna die of mummy cancer.

54:42.846 --> 54:45.014
Fire extinguished.

54:45.082 --> 54:47.417
Oxygen depletion sequence complete.

54:47.484 --> 54:49.385
Ventilation restored.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.588
Get me out of here!

54:52.594 --> 54:54.679
- Oh, careful.
- Oh, ooh... man,

54:54.702 --> 54:56.120
I don't like tight spaces.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.294
- You did great.
- Really?

54:58.362 --> 55:00.396
- Mostly.
- Thank you... ooh.

55:00.402 --> 55:02.069
I got to find Lexi.

55:02.075 --> 55:03.809
I'll be back.

55:07.371 --> 55:09.061
It's nice meeting you.

55:16.777 --> 55:19.346
Lexi, where the hell are you?

57:01.752 --> 57:04.677
Gwen. Karim Farouk is still alive.

57:04.709 --> 57:06.638
You need to call Interpol,
liaise with the FBI...

57:06.644 --> 57:08.745
What... what...? What are you doing?

57:08.751 --> 57:10.475
You're being remanded into my custody,

57:10.481 --> 57:11.768
taken back to Rome.

57:34.539 --> 57:36.973
She was found breaking into a car.

57:37.041 --> 57:39.276
Hitchhiking isn't exactly safe, is it?

57:42.713 --> 57:45.015
Castillo okay?

57:45.699 --> 57:48.300
Yeah. She's on another plane
in protective custody.

57:51.686 --> 57:53.218
Are you angry at me?

57:53.224 --> 57:56.259
Oh, just a little raw at nearly
being suffocated to death.

57:56.327 --> 57:57.761
If you'd gone after Farouk with me,

57:57.829 --> 57:59.162
it wouldn't have been an issue.

57:59.168 --> 58:01.676
Dr. Castillo and Shaw would be dead.

58:01.682 --> 58:04.134
That moron is still alive?

58:04.202 --> 58:06.303
His bulletproof vest
took most of the hit.

58:06.370 --> 58:09.139
He ran off with the rubies
from Cleopatra's headdress.

58:09.207 --> 58:11.775
Great. It all worked out, then.

58:12.601 --> 58:13.615
You are unbelievable.

58:13.621 --> 58:15.267
- You know that?
- You're unbelievable.

58:15.289 --> 58:17.957
If anyone should be mad here, it's me.

58:18.770 --> 58:20.728
You told me Farouk was dead.

58:20.734 --> 58:22.753
According to the authorities, he was.

58:22.759 --> 58:25.661
Well, the authorities were wrong, Gwen.

58:25.667 --> 58:27.124
Agent Karlsson.

58:27.432 --> 58:29.396
You worked the Farouk case?

58:29.402 --> 58:31.027
Danny was my Interpol liaison.

58:31.095 --> 58:32.729
What's your connection to Farouk?

58:32.797 --> 58:34.364
He killed my father.

58:34.432 --> 58:36.366
After you guys failed to catch him.

58:37.768 --> 58:39.302
Sorry, I didn't know.

58:39.799 --> 58:41.433
Lexi, I was told

58:41.439 --> 58:43.673
the Egyptians killed Farouk a year ago.

58:43.679 --> 58:45.929
Just shows you, if you want
something done right...

58:45.935 --> 58:47.235
Yeah? How's that going for you?

59:19.343 --> 59:21.878
Aiden Shaw is still alive,

59:21.946 --> 59:24.347
trying to escape Europe.

59:24.415 --> 59:27.184
He knows enough to be a problem.

59:28.452 --> 59:30.387
I'll handle it.

59:34.471 --> 59:35.831
I remember him.

59:36.025 --> 59:38.200
He worked for the FBI.

59:38.262 --> 59:40.363
But her...

59:40.431 --> 59:42.158
I don't know.

59:43.301 --> 59:45.235
Find out who she is.

59:57.288 --> 59:58.977
Farouk's MO

59:58.983 --> 01:00:01.551
is stealing treasure to fund terrorism.

01:00:01.619 --> 01:00:04.154
Now, going after one of the
biggest treasures of all time

01:00:04.222 --> 01:00:06.590
means he's planning something big.

01:00:06.657 --> 01:00:09.726
It took less than a million
to plan and execute 9/11.

01:00:09.794 --> 01:00:11.728
Antony's sarcophagus alone

01:00:11.796 --> 01:00:14.097
would be worth a fortune
on the black market.

01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:15.937
And now, Farouk has it.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.002
Aiden Shaw was Farouk's fence.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.304
He is our only thread to finding him.

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.006
Cut us loose when we
land, I promise you,

01:00:23.074 --> 01:00:25.228
I will call you the moment we find Shaw.

01:00:25.234 --> 01:00:28.340
Danny, this is now a global
terrorism investigation.

01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:30.874
Every intelligence agency in the world

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.344
is on high alert.

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:34.048
You know I can't just cut you loose.

01:00:34.054 --> 01:00:35.685
Gwen, I can fix this.

01:00:35.753 --> 01:00:37.621
We are so close to finding Farouk.

01:00:37.688 --> 01:00:40.257
Just... get the ball rolling.

01:00:40.324 --> 01:00:43.093
Radio in about Shaw. Have
the Swiss issue a BOLO locally

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.629
and a Red Notice internationally
so he can't get far.

01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:48.265
Think of all the exciting
paperwork you get to file.

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:49.737
We all want to stop Farouk,

01:00:49.743 --> 01:00:51.194
and every second we waste,

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.204
Shaw gets closer to getting
away forever or being killed.

01:00:54.272 --> 01:00:57.440
Either way, our trail to
follow Farouk gets cold.

01:00:57.508 --> 01:00:58.708
And the next time he pops up,

01:00:58.714 --> 01:01:00.573
he's gonna kill a lot more people.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:11.116
Bad news.

01:01:11.122 --> 01:01:13.356
There's a couple of Farouk's
guys watching the shop.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.388
I can't get to your rainy day money.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.495
What about my rubies?

01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:21.064
Sorry. I can't find a buyer.

01:01:21.132 --> 01:01:23.066
Too hot.

01:01:23.072 --> 01:01:25.406
Word's out where they came from.

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.182
But I do know a place where

01:01:27.188 --> 01:01:29.077
they won't ask any questions,

01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:31.205
if you can get there.

01:01:32.434 --> 01:01:35.168
Okay, when we land,
you and I can figure out

01:01:35.174 --> 01:01:36.908
what to do with Farouk and Shaw.

01:01:36.914 --> 01:01:38.248
As for this one,

01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:39.621
there is a list of agencies

01:01:39.627 --> 01:01:41.946
that wants to talk to
her about past crimes.

01:01:41.952 --> 01:01:44.854
Wait until you see how exciting
that paperwork is.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.160
I'm gonna radio in

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:47.900
a Red Notice request on Shaw.

01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:58.099
I thought she'd never leave.

01:01:58.836 --> 01:02:01.738
Look, Red Notice or not,

01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:04.207
I don't trust the police
to work fast enough,

01:02:04.275 --> 01:02:05.863
nor Shaw to keep himself alive

01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:07.615
long enough for us to find him.

01:02:07.678 --> 01:02:09.179
And there is no way in hell

01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:12.115
I am letting them ship me off
to some jail in Bahrain.

01:02:12.183 --> 01:02:13.917
What did you do in Bahrain?

01:02:13.923 --> 01:02:15.691
Jordan, Russia, Bahrain...
Any of them...

01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:17.999
if I'm on this plane when
it lands, I'm screwed.

01:02:24.795 --> 01:02:26.353
Twist the heel.

01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:29.493
A girl can never be too careful.

01:02:31.802 --> 01:02:34.304
Toss it back.

01:02:34.372 --> 01:02:35.805
What are you waiting for?

01:02:35.811 --> 01:02:37.412
I've got a pretty loud voice in my head

01:02:37.418 --> 01:02:39.319
telling me this is a terrible idea.

01:02:39.325 --> 01:02:41.144
Oh, you've got to ignore that voice.

01:02:41.212 --> 01:02:42.712
Come on.

01:02:54.992 --> 01:02:58.128
So... you with me or not?

01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:00.630
I'm surprised you haven't
already left me behind.

01:03:00.698 --> 01:03:02.599
Farouk has eluded every
government on Earth,

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:05.435
and, apparently, any attempt
to capture or kill him.

01:03:05.441 --> 01:03:07.875
We found him in 48 hours.

01:03:07.881 --> 01:03:09.499
I don't know about you, but I think

01:03:09.505 --> 01:03:10.605
we make a pretty good team.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:16.375
Hurry, she'll be back any minute.

01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:27.357
Now... now we just need a plan.

01:03:27.425 --> 01:03:29.859
Wait, wait, I thought you had a plan.

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:31.294
I did.

01:03:37.268 --> 01:03:39.469
Hey, hey, they just pulled the flaps.

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:41.171
Which means we're on
approach to the airport

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:42.806
and below 2,000 feet.

01:03:42.812 --> 01:03:44.031
We can jump.

01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:45.375
See?

01:03:45.443 --> 01:03:47.610
We already have phase two of the plan.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.150
How hard was that?

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:50.923
Uh, I just found the hard part.

01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:54.259
There's only one parachute.

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:58.216
Okay. I'll take it.

01:03:58.222 --> 01:04:01.391
You somehow made that sound noble.

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:02.725
Have you even done this before?

01:04:02.793 --> 01:04:04.477
No, but I'm pretty
sure gravity does most

01:04:04.483 --> 01:04:05.967
of the work until you pull the cord.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.297
You can just hang on to me.

01:04:07.364 --> 01:04:09.332
The FBI put me through jump school,

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.334
and you already left
me for dead once today.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.170
You can hold on to me.

01:04:13.176 --> 01:04:15.460
How long are you gonna
hold that over my head?

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:18.675
The Carabinieri's gonna be all over us.

01:04:18.742 --> 01:04:20.919
We need to move quickly
once we hit the ground.

01:04:30.621 --> 01:04:33.990
Hold on, I need to make sure
we land in the right place.

01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:36.659
Why are we suddenly doing your plan?

01:04:37.523 --> 01:04:40.336
Because I'm the one with the parachute.

01:05:12.296 --> 01:05:13.396
Great.

01:05:13.464 --> 01:05:15.598
Nice plan.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:30.543
Ahem!

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:33.022
Come with me...

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:34.303
Please.

01:05:37.221 --> 01:05:38.345
Oh...

01:05:39.229 --> 01:05:40.496
Great.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:42.193
I can finally scratch "spend a night

01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:45.268
"in the Vatican police
station" off my bucket list.

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:47.336
Your friend sure took his time.

01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:49.872
It's not like we called ahead.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.674
You said he was a professor.

01:05:51.742 --> 01:05:53.109
How's he gonna be able to help us?

01:05:53.176 --> 01:05:54.977
It's just his side gig.

01:05:55.045 --> 01:05:57.658
He also works for the
Vatican's foreign ministry.

01:05:57.664 --> 01:05:59.727
- Huh.
- You know how you could help?

01:05:59.733 --> 01:06:01.434
- Not say anything?
- Hmm.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:05.379
Please wait there.

01:06:06.986 --> 01:06:08.953
Don't let the uniforms fool you.

01:06:09.081 --> 01:06:10.515
The Swiss Guard are some of

01:06:10.521 --> 01:06:12.356
the most elite soldiers in the world.

01:06:12.362 --> 01:06:15.531
Everyone's laughing
too hard to fight back.

01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:20.670
Monsignor Donnelly
will meet with you now.

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:32.375
They told me that a man

01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:34.689
came from the sky

01:06:34.915 --> 01:06:37.550
and asked for me by name.

01:06:40.223 --> 01:06:42.325
Imagine my disappointment.

01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:46.896
Come here.

01:06:47.296 --> 01:06:49.363
Come here. Oh...

01:06:49.369 --> 01:06:50.949
It's good to see you, Chuck.

01:06:50.955 --> 01:06:53.002
Seriously, what are you doing here?

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:54.870
- It's kind of a long story.
- Yeah? Who are you?

01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:56.424
- Oh, I'm...
- She's just, uh, a friend.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.774
We're in a bit of a hurry.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.855
Danny, you can't just
parachute into the Vatican

01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:01.339
without expecting a few questions.

01:07:01.345 --> 01:07:03.354
Yes, but it won't take
long for Interpol and

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.102
the Carabinieri to find
out that we're here.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.343
Oh, they found out.
They're at the gate right now.

01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:10.181
What? Okay, Chuck, I need
you to hold them off.

01:07:10.187 --> 01:07:11.754
Dude, you are acting crazy.

01:07:11.822 --> 01:07:14.223
You come in here, bringing
a boatload of chaos.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.692
What is going... Oh,
my God, you're Lexi.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.069
Yeah. So you've heard about me?

01:07:19.075 --> 01:07:20.624
Oh, I've heard a great deal about you.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:23.199
Chuck, can we talk privately?

01:07:25.502 --> 01:07:27.970
By all means.

01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:32.503
- What the hell is going on?
- It's not what it looks like.

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:34.477
It looks like you're getting
mixed up with a criminal

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.540
who's already broken your heart once.

01:07:36.546 --> 01:07:38.547
Okay, it's partially what it looks like.

01:07:38.615 --> 01:07:41.417
Oh, my God, Danny,
how stupid can you be?

01:07:41.485 --> 01:07:44.174
My God, you have got
to be the dumbest...

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.237
Chuck...

01:07:45.243 --> 01:07:47.485
Did I not give you enough
penance last time, is that it?

01:07:47.491 --> 01:07:49.615
Did you want an exorcist?
We got 'em here.

01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:51.122
One of 'em actually owes me a favor...

01:07:51.128 --> 01:07:53.295
Chuck! Farouk's alive.

01:07:53.363 --> 01:07:55.765
He's behind the pyramid attack.

01:07:55.955 --> 01:07:57.356
I thought they droned that guy.

01:07:57.362 --> 01:07:58.896
Yeah, well, apparently it didn't take.

01:07:58.902 --> 01:08:00.340
We we're trying to track him down,

01:08:00.346 --> 01:08:01.764
but we got caught up in some stuff,

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:03.771
and I just don't have
time to sort it all out.

01:08:03.777 --> 01:08:06.504
This is gonna end badly.
She's the devil.

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.511
Will you help me or not?

01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:11.229
None of this is covered under
regular priest-friend rules.

01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:12.275
You know that.

01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:13.649
Thank you. Thank you.

01:08:13.717 --> 01:08:15.618
In the meantime, make
sure she steers clear

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:17.058
of the fountain in the courtyard.

01:08:17.064 --> 01:08:18.782
I don't want the holy water boiling out.

01:08:20.938 --> 01:08:22.853
You know, with the
acoustics in this place,

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.361
I could hear everything he just said?

01:08:25.429 --> 01:08:28.064
Look, Chuck sometimes says
stuff he doesn't mean.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.666
- Hmm.
- I absolutely meant every word.

01:08:34.104 --> 01:08:36.678
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Agent Karlsson, stay calm, eh?

01:08:36.684 --> 01:08:38.285
We're not going to be having a shootout

01:08:38.353 --> 01:08:39.720
in the Sistine Chapel, huh?

01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:41.787
I'm not letting them
hide behind this gate.

01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:44.089
Remember, you are a guest in my country.

01:08:44.268 --> 01:08:45.595
Calmati.

01:08:45.827 --> 01:08:47.761
Let me handle it, va bene?

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:52.399
Ci penso io.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:55.234
Hi. Monsignor Charles Donnelly.

01:08:55.303 --> 01:08:56.703
Uh, can I be of service?

01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:58.082
- Yes.
- You're American.

01:08:58.087 --> 01:08:59.522
Is the pope Catholic?

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:04.944
Vatican joke. Sorry.
Uh, yes, I am American.

01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:06.636
- Is that all you needed?
- No.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.582
- We want to...
- We need to gain entry.

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.216
And you are...

01:09:10.223 --> 01:09:12.511
- Agent Gwen Karlsson, Interpol.
- Oh.

01:09:12.721 --> 01:09:15.216
Unfortunately, Interpol
doesn't have jurisdiction here.

01:09:15.223 --> 01:09:18.363
I'm Captain Bruno Fabi
of the Carabinieri,

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:20.689
and I do have jurisdiction here.

01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:22.996
Vatican City is a sovereign city-state,

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:26.600
and, uh, as such, Italian
authorities do not,

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:29.569
technically, have jurisdiction here.

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:32.305
"The Holy See shall hand
over to the Italian state

01:09:32.312 --> 01:09:35.286
"all persons who may have taken
refuge within Vatican City

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:37.367
"when accused of acts committed
within Italian territory

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:38.840
"which are considered to be criminal

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:40.247
"by the law of both states."

01:09:41.316 --> 01:09:43.116
So you have paperwork

01:09:43.184 --> 01:09:45.419
attesting to the fact that such persons

01:09:45.486 --> 01:09:46.920
are being accused of such acts?

01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:48.760
Okay, we're gonna get the court order,

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:50.319
- and we will be right back.
- No...

01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:52.604
Sounds great. Have a blessed morning.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:53.977
She was...

01:09:58.805 --> 01:10:00.662
Sorry I couldn't buy you more time.

01:10:00.668 --> 01:10:02.970
They'll be back any
minute with a warrant.

01:10:03.037 --> 01:10:05.232
I guess somebody here knows
how to piss people off.

01:10:05.238 --> 01:10:07.474
What about the names
I asked you to run down

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.570
at the foreign ministry?

01:10:08.576 --> 01:10:10.611
Yeah, uh, nothing on Aiden Shaw,

01:10:10.617 --> 01:10:12.107
but I did get a hit on the other guy.

01:10:12.113 --> 01:10:13.714
What other guy?

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:16.048
Dwayne Coleman.

01:10:16.198 --> 01:10:19.287
Shaw wouldn't be dumb enough
to travel under his real name.

01:10:19.293 --> 01:10:21.216
- Would he?
- He wouldn't have had much time

01:10:21.222 --> 01:10:22.639
to create a new identity.

01:10:22.645 --> 01:10:26.188
Well, Dwayne Coleman entered
Istanbul an hour ago.

01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:29.255
That's perfect. We could
be there in a couple hours.

01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:31.895
Uh, are you forgetting
that the Carabinieri

01:10:31.901 --> 01:10:33.667
have this whole city surrounded?

01:10:33.735 --> 01:10:35.535
Not a problem.

01:10:35.603 --> 01:10:38.005
Just need you to take me
to the first floor reading room

01:10:38.072 --> 01:10:40.140
of the Apostolic Library.

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.808
Why?

01:10:41.876 --> 01:10:45.012
There's a secret escape
tunnel under the Vatican.

01:10:55.616 --> 01:10:57.619
So, did you, uh, learn about

01:10:57.625 --> 01:11:00.027
this secret passageway from that book

01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:02.162
where aliens started the church

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:05.959
and left clues all throughout
Europe in plain sight?

01:11:06.468 --> 01:11:08.269
Oh, no, I know, I know.

01:11:08.275 --> 01:11:10.737
It was the one about the Illuminati

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.739
with the conspiracy theory, and...

01:11:12.807 --> 01:11:16.139
"Only one man can stop it!"

01:11:16.844 --> 01:11:20.397
Danny, dude, if there was
a secret passageway in here,

01:11:20.403 --> 01:11:22.215
I would know about it, okay?

01:11:22.283 --> 01:11:24.217
Me and Papa are tight.

01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:31.525
Looks like Papa's been
holding out on you, Chuck.

01:11:32.694 --> 01:11:34.227
Clever.

01:11:35.779 --> 01:11:38.132
Hey. Hey, hey, your friend better not

01:11:38.138 --> 01:11:40.639
think about using this
to rob the Vatican!

01:11:40.668 --> 01:11:42.636
Too late!

01:11:53.465 --> 01:11:54.765
Jay.

01:11:54.771 --> 01:11:56.672
Danny. You okay, kid?

01:11:56.678 --> 01:11:58.880
Yeah. The less I tell you, the better.

01:11:58.886 --> 01:12:00.549
Considering why I'm calling.

01:12:00.555 --> 01:12:02.989
I know. Farouk's alive.

01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:05.659
Just tell me you're not
going after him on your own.

01:12:05.727 --> 01:12:07.060
We found him yesterday.

01:12:07.128 --> 01:12:09.930
He got away, but now we've got a lead.

01:12:09.936 --> 01:12:11.493
I just need to borrow your jet again.

01:12:11.499 --> 01:12:12.740
What if I said no?

01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:14.614
I mean, not without my security detail.

01:12:14.742 --> 01:12:16.075
I'd tell you I'm going anyway,

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.894
and I don't have any time to waste.

01:12:19.107 --> 01:12:20.714
All right. I'll make sure the

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.581
jet's waiting for you at Ciampino.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.206
You still with the girl?

01:12:24.212 --> 01:12:27.748
Yeah, yeah, we're in it
until we stop Farouk.

01:12:27.754 --> 01:12:29.076
I owe it to her.

01:12:29.082 --> 01:12:30.412
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:12:30.418 --> 01:12:31.418
I'll keep you posted.

01:12:31.424 --> 01:12:32.518
Thanks, Jay.

01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:35.789
I'm so hungry. Want a bite?

01:12:35.857 --> 01:12:38.258
Reece's plane is waiting
to take us to Istanbul.

01:12:38.326 --> 01:12:40.827
Now we just need to figure out where.

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:42.534
There's only one place in the area where

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.059
he could unload Cleopatra's rubies,

01:12:44.065 --> 01:12:46.933
no questions asked: the Byzantia Casino.

01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:48.201
Never heard of it.

01:12:48.269 --> 01:12:49.803
It's more my crowd than yours.

01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:51.171
Place is on the Black Sea.

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:53.039
It accepts any high-value
items as collateral.

01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:55.175
Rubies for casino chips.

01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:57.344
Try to double your money
while laundering it.

01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:59.130
Smart for the casino, at least.

01:12:59.136 --> 01:13:01.443
Personally, I'd cash out immediately,

01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:03.790
but I bet Shaw thinks
he can beat the house.

01:13:05.386 --> 01:13:07.687
You got sandwich all over your face.

01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.998
Shaw has been spotted in Istanbul.

01:13:18.613 --> 01:13:22.369
The American and the girl
appear to be following him.

01:13:22.437 --> 01:13:25.472
We have assets near
the border we can send.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.874
No, I-I don't want to
draw unnecessary attention

01:13:27.942 --> 01:13:29.376
with a lot of gunfire.

01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:32.307
Send in the Scorpion.

01:13:34.032 --> 01:13:35.900
Kill them all.

01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:46.267
Dr. Castillo.

01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:49.765
Sorry about all the
security; not my choice.

01:13:49.999 --> 01:13:52.740
The minute Reece found out
that Farouk was alive,

01:13:52.746 --> 01:13:54.757
his security force descended upon me.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:58.046
I'm Captain Bruno Fabi
of the Carabinieri TPC.

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:00.872
We're responsible for combating
art and antiquities crimes.

01:14:00.878 --> 01:14:02.936
I've already told Interpol
everything that I know.

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:04.876
I apologize for the inconvenience,

01:14:04.882 --> 01:14:06.022
but we have lost the two

01:14:06.028 --> 01:14:07.305
people we had in custody.

01:14:07.311 --> 01:14:09.047
Did something happen to Danny?

01:14:09.053 --> 01:14:11.055
Danny and Lexi Vaziri
broke out of custody.

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:13.651
Thank God.

01:14:13.719 --> 01:14:15.553
You had me worried there for a minute.

01:14:15.559 --> 01:14:17.033
You don't happen to know where they are?

01:14:17.039 --> 01:14:18.978
They're probably looking
for Karim Farouk,

01:14:18.984 --> 01:14:20.351
which is what you should be doing

01:14:20.357 --> 01:14:21.524
instead of bothering them.

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:23.049
Who knows about the tomb of Antony

01:14:23.055 --> 01:14:24.495
being inside of the pyramid?

01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:26.117
Me, my whole team...

01:14:26.123 --> 01:14:27.276
Who are all dead...

01:14:27.282 --> 01:14:28.621
The terrorists, of course,

01:14:28.627 --> 01:14:30.423
Danny McNamara and Jay Reece,

01:14:30.429 --> 01:14:31.796
who funded the expedition.

01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:33.765
We should keep it that way for now.

01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.834
We are trying to avoid a media circus.

01:14:35.901 --> 01:14:37.969
I totally agree. Although, there is that

01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:40.673
little fact that the Nazis
may have taken Cleopatra

01:14:40.679 --> 01:14:43.571
75 years ago and that
might cause quite a stir.

01:14:43.577 --> 01:14:44.610
Wait, what?

01:14:44.616 --> 01:14:46.327
There was a dead body in the tomb,

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.531
a German, Nazi Afrika Corps.

01:14:48.537 --> 01:14:51.033
- They must've taken her.
- That wasn't in the notes.

01:14:51.039 --> 01:14:52.189
She didn't tell me about it.

01:14:52.195 --> 01:14:53.595
I really don't see how it relates

01:14:53.601 --> 01:14:55.704
to a current terror investigation.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.248
What's this?

01:15:00.254 --> 01:15:02.689
Oh, that was found in
the dead Nazi's hand.

01:15:02.695 --> 01:15:04.729
On the one side, it's
an inscription, "VICI."

01:15:04.735 --> 01:15:07.361
Haven't quite figured out
what that one means yet.

01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:10.135
On the other, it's an
Ancient Greek Serapis.

01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:12.704
I'm very sorry, but this is evidence.

01:15:12.771 --> 01:15:15.039
- We need to examine it.
- Absolutely.

01:15:15.107 --> 01:15:17.308
I have no more questions, Doctor.

01:15:17.314 --> 01:15:19.415
The Carabinieri thank you
for your continued help

01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:21.555
with the investigation.

01:15:52.077 --> 01:15:54.045
Isn't it weird that a
tiny part of me hopes

01:15:54.051 --> 01:15:55.734
we have Shaw all wrong,

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.175
and he was smart enough
to just keep going?

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:00.027
Blackjack!

01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:03.035
You are so cute.

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.697
Darling, I'd love another Vesper.

01:16:12.765 --> 01:16:14.599
- Evening.
- Crap.

01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:15.905
May we join you?

01:16:15.911 --> 01:16:17.745
The gentleman's
requested a private game.

01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:19.869
No, we're old friends.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.986
He's got no secrets from us.

01:16:24.043 --> 01:16:27.245
- Where did you get all that cash?
- Reece's card.

01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:29.285
I took it from your wallet
while you were changing.

01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:30.624
How did you know the PIN?

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:32.230
Oh, you know, one of my little toys.

01:16:32.272 --> 01:16:33.929
The same guy who made my PIN descrambler

01:16:33.935 --> 01:16:35.302
also made the geo tracker app

01:16:35.308 --> 01:16:37.157
I put on Shaw's phone back in Rome.

01:16:37.163 --> 01:16:39.464
So that's how you found
me in Switzerland,

01:16:40.002 --> 01:16:41.733
you violated my privacy.

01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:43.135
I saved your life,

01:16:43.202 --> 01:16:45.137
and you ran five minutes later

01:16:45.204 --> 01:16:47.539
with a pocket full of stolen rubies.

01:16:47.607 --> 01:16:49.875
No, you two got me shot.

01:16:49.942 --> 01:16:52.310
I thought the rubies were
a fair consolation prize.

01:16:52.378 --> 01:16:55.247
Unfortunately, harder
to liquidate than I expected.

01:16:55.314 --> 01:16:57.482
Well, your life is still in danger.

01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:59.084
We need to get out of here.

01:16:59.152 --> 01:17:01.386
Relax, they won't make
a move on me in public

01:17:01.454 --> 01:17:02.869
surrounded by cameras.

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:05.062
I'm as safe as I can be in here.

01:17:05.124 --> 01:17:07.292
And I've nearly doubled my money.

01:17:08.159 --> 01:17:09.428
Blackjack.

01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:11.724
You see, sometimes in life

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:14.171
you have to make your own luck.

01:17:19.138 --> 01:17:21.440
Doesn't seem like a heart attack.

01:17:21.507 --> 01:17:23.241
He's sweating buckets.

01:17:23.309 --> 01:17:25.444
Yeah, me, too.

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:27.186
Me, too.

01:17:28.073 --> 01:17:29.536
Wait...

01:17:30.789 --> 01:17:32.510
The chips.

01:17:32.516 --> 01:17:34.155
Danny, they're poisoned.

01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:36.095
The dealer.

01:17:41.666 --> 01:17:43.330
You get out.

01:17:44.063 --> 01:17:45.497
What'd you poison us with?

01:17:45.503 --> 01:17:46.770
Give us the antidote.

01:18:02.215 --> 01:18:04.783
Danny, I'm seeing two of them.

01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:06.518
Go for the one on the left.

01:18:18.701 --> 01:18:20.269
Hurry.

01:18:33.049 --> 01:18:34.965
Thanks...

01:18:36.782 --> 01:18:39.885
For unpoisoning me first.

01:18:39.952 --> 01:18:43.155
Thanks for not leaving me behind again.

01:18:48.161 --> 01:18:49.928
Oh...

01:18:49.996 --> 01:18:51.363
Shaw!

01:18:56.718 --> 01:19:00.718
Shot, poisoned, mummied?

01:19:01.476 --> 01:19:03.608
- I'm telling you, I'm cursed.
- Hey,

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:06.444
don't let anybody touch that
table. It's covered in poison.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.803
And we should probably get
out of here before the police

01:19:08.809 --> 01:19:11.151
- or another assassin arrives.
- Are you okay?

01:19:11.157 --> 01:19:13.885
Suddenly you realize
just how short life is.

01:19:14.135 --> 01:19:16.020
You just want to find somebody special

01:19:16.026 --> 01:19:17.560
to spend that time with, you know?

01:19:17.566 --> 01:19:19.323
- Come on, Romeo.
- Let me get her number.

01:19:19.329 --> 01:19:20.776
Who knows how much time I got left?

01:19:20.782 --> 01:19:22.416
Why don't you tell us
where to find Farouk

01:19:22.422 --> 01:19:23.807
before we feed you those chips?

01:19:23.813 --> 01:19:25.781
All I know is how he was gonna pay me,

01:19:25.787 --> 01:19:29.357
and I'll happily tell you as
soon as I have an immunity deal.

01:19:42.795 --> 01:19:43.861
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:43.929 --> 01:19:45.496
Thank God.

01:19:45.502 --> 01:19:47.603
Shaw's in custody,
getting medical treatment.

01:19:47.609 --> 01:19:49.239
We didn't get much out of him.

01:19:49.245 --> 01:19:51.335
Upside, we're no longer
international fugitives.

01:19:51.341 --> 01:19:52.733
Downside, we can't leave the EU

01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:54.079
without permission from Interpol.

01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:55.802
Well, good luck with that.

01:19:55.932 --> 01:19:57.332
I'm going after Farouk

01:19:57.338 --> 01:19:59.739
wherever that takes me, and Gwen...

01:19:59.869 --> 01:20:01.202
Gwen can suck it.

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:03.247
What're you researching?

01:20:03.253 --> 01:20:05.190
Teutonic occultism.

01:20:05.196 --> 01:20:07.213
There were dead Nazis in the tomb.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.600
Seriously?

01:20:08.606 --> 01:20:10.607
I think that they took Cleopatra.

01:20:10.613 --> 01:20:13.181
I am just trying to figure out why.

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:16.146
Well, the Nazis believed
that some sacred objects

01:20:16.213 --> 01:20:18.648
held actual power, like the Holy Grail,

01:20:18.654 --> 01:20:20.655
Spear of Destiny. I mean,

01:20:20.661 --> 01:20:22.194
maybe they thought Cleopatra did.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.948
Well, if they believed
in the supernatural,

01:20:23.954 --> 01:20:25.321
then wouldn't they believe in the curse

01:20:25.327 --> 01:20:27.061
if they disturbed her tomb?

01:20:27.067 --> 01:20:29.769
What if they were trying
to weaponize that?

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.662
Turn an artifact into a
weapon of mass destruction.

01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.230
Like that old movie.

01:20:34.298 --> 01:20:36.599
- Indiana Jones.
- Maybe?

01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:38.935
Really? You two used to date?

01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:40.465
But none of this explains what Farouk

01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:42.472
actually wanted Cleopatra for.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.109
Look, Farouk left everything
from Cleopatra's tomb

01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:48.739
at the free port, but what did he take?

01:20:50.514 --> 01:20:53.889
The heaviest and hardest thing
to move, Antony's sarcophagus.

01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:56.372
Well, you said yourself, it's
worth its weight in gold.

01:20:56.378 --> 01:20:58.588
Yeah, but I'm starting to think
it might be more than that.

01:20:58.594 --> 01:21:00.485
I mean, he kept Dr. Castillo alive. Why?

01:21:00.491 --> 01:21:02.682
She's an expert on Cleopatra.

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:05.930
What if he wants to reunite
Cleopatra with Antony?

01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:10.000
We find Cleopatra, we'll find Farouk.

01:21:10.006 --> 01:21:11.794
And I'll be at Shaw's
bedside threatening him

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.567
with a rusty catheter
if he doesn't talk.

01:21:13.573 --> 01:21:15.205
And I'll be right there
with you keeping you

01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:16.562
from violating the Geneva Conventions,

01:21:16.568 --> 01:21:18.002
but in the meantime...

01:21:18.008 --> 01:21:19.605
We have to find Cleopatra.
Danny's right.

01:21:19.611 --> 01:21:22.346
No one who has been looking
for her in the two millennia

01:21:22.352 --> 01:21:25.588
knew exactly where to start,
but we know exactly

01:21:25.594 --> 01:21:27.294
where she was 70 years ago.

01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:28.680
As does Farouk.

01:21:28.686 --> 01:21:30.316
Hmm-mm. I have something
that he doesn't.

01:21:30.322 --> 01:21:31.581
What is that?

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:34.390
I think it's the key
to finding Cleopatra.

01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:36.159
The medallion says "Serapis,"

01:21:36.227 --> 01:21:37.894
a deity that had a cult of followers

01:21:37.962 --> 01:21:40.730
in the time of Cleopatra.
The cult was presumed

01:21:40.798 --> 01:21:43.333
to have died out after
Rome conquered Egypt.

01:21:45.035 --> 01:21:48.181
But if that's true, then
what was this medallion

01:21:48.187 --> 01:21:51.541
doing in the hands of a
dead Nazi in the 1940s?

01:21:51.547 --> 01:21:53.571
I believe whoever killed those Nazis

01:21:53.577 --> 01:21:55.273
is the same group that moved Antony

01:21:55.279 --> 01:21:58.081
and Cleopatra into the
pyramid in the first place.

01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:59.625
Fabi, what have you learned

01:21:59.631 --> 01:22:01.489
about the American and the girl?

01:22:01.552 --> 01:22:03.911
Resourceful, driven,

01:22:04.722 --> 01:22:07.357
worthy adversaries in the hunt.

01:22:07.363 --> 01:22:09.175
If they get in our way,

01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:12.550
it will be up to you
to deal with them both.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.534
They must be her protectors,

01:22:17.663 --> 01:22:19.097
and if they are still

01:22:19.103 --> 01:22:21.371
around today, then they are the key

01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:25.041
to finding Cleopatra
and stopping Farouk.
