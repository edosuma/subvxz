02:02.956 --> 02:04.758
It's okay, baby.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.094
It's okay, it's okay.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.645
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.153
Look what mama's got.
Look, look what mama's got.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.747
Oh, baby, please.
It's okay, Maddie, it's okay.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.250
Daddy's gonna be home soon and we
have to go, we have to leave, okay.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.568
Good girl, good girl.

02:34.367 --> 02:38.410
It's gonna be okay. I know, I know.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.501
Hey!

03:06.931 --> 03:08.946
Please just let us go.

03:09.046 --> 03:10.991
- What are you doing?
- Please, just please let us go.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.675
No.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.799
Maddie.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.176
God, what have I done?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.621
- Good run?
- Perfect.

05:18.984 --> 05:21.422
I think it's time she slept in her own bed.

05:23.419 --> 05:26.043
- How 'bout next week?
- Deal.

05:26.693 --> 05:31.180
- You better hit the showers, Dr. Morgan.
- I love you, too, Dr. Morgan.

05:40.606 --> 05:45.111
For me, "Purple Rain" is actually
a song about fatherhood.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.502
Like when he says... "I never
wanted to be your weekend lover."

05:47.602 --> 05:51.407
Like single fathers who don't get
to see their kids as often...

05:51.507 --> 05:54.855
...and they wanted more than that, you know.
Thank God I'm not a single father.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.858
I think he had a lot of girlfriends,
and stuff, didn't he?

05:57.958 --> 06:01.394
- That's how I see this.
- You're so trusting. That's how we roll.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.530
- That's it.
- I love you, Daddy.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.198
I love you, sweetheart.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.234
You're a romantic guy, that's why I love you.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.370
I love you, sweetheart!

06:11.269 --> 06:15.942
Before I forget. This is for Lydia
Legowitz, if you can give it to her.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.713
It's her 50th birthday. Remember,
she's the nurse in the OR with red hair?

06:19.813 --> 06:23.269
- Yeah, the one with the big boobs.
- Yes, yes, the big boobs.

06:23.369 --> 06:27.387
- And, this is... this is for Jenkins.
- Who's that guy?

06:27.487 --> 06:30.540
He was the guy who's my last
patient before I took leave.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.531
And he was really funny.
Remember I talked about him all the time?

06:33.631 --> 06:37.180
Anyway, he went into remission and so,
he's going back into chemo.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.134
- You really miss work, don't you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.137
But, hey, I get to go to Mommy and Me...

06:44.237 --> 06:47.374
...and sing about poo and pee
and all about my ABC's.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.010
You're a very beautiful girl and I love you.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.553
I love you, too. Please don't kill
yourself on this thing, doctor.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.234
Bye.

07:07.259 --> 07:08.829
Cute.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.098
- I'm sorry, is she yours?
- She is.

07:11.198 --> 07:15.235
I'm sorry, here I am stealing her soul,
and I haven't even introduced myself.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.461
- I'm Angela Morgan.
- Katie Wells.

07:17.561 --> 07:20.140
- Mama, Mama, I made a new friend.
- So nice to meet you.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.546
- Her name is Cora.
- She's really cute.

07:23.646 --> 07:26.870
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes, finally.

07:26.970 --> 07:31.184
Haven't I said from day one
you two were destined to be BFF's?

07:31.978 --> 07:35.789
This is Katie. Yes, I've heard about you.

07:35.889 --> 07:40.827
So I'm thinking threesome playdate.
Angie's house, you guys bring the kids.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.261
- I bring the juice boxes and the booze?
- Yeah, sounds good to me.

07:44.361 --> 07:47.667
That's what I'm talking about.
You two continue.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.504
- Can I bring anything?
- Nah, just yourself.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.405
- Okay.
- Husband optional.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.574
- I'm single.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.810
I mean, I'm not sorry that...

07:56.910 --> 07:59.179
You know what I mean. Just come.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.481
It's fine, I know I'm the minority.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.317
Well, you won't be by kindergarten.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.838
Cheese, girls.

08:08.916 --> 08:12.392
- Where's the pink marker?
- You haven't told her those stories yet?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.161
No, I haven't.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.297
Brenda tells me that you guys
have been friends for a while.

08:18.382 --> 08:22.769
Yeah. She was first my trainer
and then we became pals.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.901
- I know her body better than Brian does.
- Yeah, you wish.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.077
But me and Angie actually got
really close during her pregnancy.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.445
Which was a bit of a nightmare.

08:32.544 --> 08:36.116
I could not have gotten
through it without you.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.119
- I'll drink to that.
- Here's to you. Yeah.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.859
Why our gym?

08:41.787 --> 08:46.456
You know, I love to train and I fell in love
with Cora the moment she was born.

08:46.556 --> 08:48.092
So...

08:48.192 --> 08:52.833
...I figured starting a Mommy and Me business
seemed the best way to infuse the two.

08:52.933 --> 08:56.785
Get 'em while they're young.
That's her motto.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.187
Slumber party?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.258
Yeah, I guess... I guess it turned into that.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.028
Oh, my God, we had so much fun.
It was hysterical.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.382
Who's that?

09:58.401 --> 10:00.816
That's Katie, my play date.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.052
Did you have a good night?

10:06.638 --> 10:08.490
Missed you.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.527
I'm so sleepy.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.878
Cora?

10:31.030 --> 10:35.435
- What's going on? Is everyone okay?
- Oh, hi! Sorry, did we wake you?

10:35.535 --> 10:36.870
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Daddy!

10:36.970 --> 10:42.442
- I made some breakfast. I hope it's okay.
- Yeah, I don't mind at all.

10:42.542 --> 10:46.279
It's this guy you have to worry about.
He's our designated chef.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.735
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Morgan.
- Brian.

10:48.835 --> 10:51.244
- Hi.
- And you must be Maddie.

10:51.344 --> 10:53.800
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.556
Okay, here it is.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.875
Yours is coming.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.597
- Keep still, Maddie.
- Is it done yet?

11:04.697 --> 11:06.499
Almost.

11:07.404 --> 11:10.103
Look at that. You're really good.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.073
Oh, thank you, it's my only talent.

11:13.173 --> 11:17.177
- Wow, you're an artist.
- Oh, in my fantasies.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.349
In real life, I paint houses.
I specialize in interiors.

11:22.749 --> 11:26.353
It's hard work but the hours are flexible
and I can take Maddie along.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.165
Okay, next.

11:29.656 --> 11:33.240
- And what can I do for you?
- Butterfly!

11:33.340 --> 11:36.363
That is gonna look so beautiful.
Okay, come here, let's start with pink.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.531
Good choice.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.933
I know this sounds silly, but I would
love to start my own business...

11:42.033 --> 11:43.870
...painting kid's bedroom murals.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.640
I don't know, like pirates, and fairies,
and butterflies, and stuff like that.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.076
- That's be great.
- You think so?

11:50.176 --> 11:53.246
Oh, yeah, around here, you'll clean up.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.849
- Keep still.
- You guys, this is amazing.

11:56.949 --> 12:00.787
I love this. Definitely photo op, come on.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.691
- Let's get together. Come on, come on.
- I don't know, I'm okay.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.761
- I'm gonna just go over here.
- Katie, what's the matter?

12:08.861 --> 12:12.132
I hate take... having my picture taken.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.168
- But you're so gorgeous.
- Oh, stop it.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.970
- Get in here.
- Come on, sit down, come on.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.073
- Just one.
- The artist and the subject.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.142
- Say butterfly.
- Butterfly.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.645
- Butterfly.
- Got it.

12:25.145 --> 12:29.115
But, you know, one in five guys enjoy
mowing their own lawn and I'm one of them.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.685
- You do? You have a lawnmower?
- I enjoy it, it relaxes me.

12:32.785 --> 12:37.190
Listen, let's all raise a glass and toast
the beginning of another wonderful summer.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.087
And all our friends who always
make it so special. The tried and true.

12:41.187 --> 12:44.664
- Thanks, Brian.
- I see you, Bar and the new.

12:44.764 --> 12:49.969
Yes, a big round of applause for the new one
who knows her way around a kitchen.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.573
Because as much as I love
and respect my daughter-in law...

12:53.673 --> 12:55.957
Speech, speech.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.512
Okay.

12:59.412 --> 13:03.140
Well, to be here today is unbelievable.

13:03.240 --> 13:08.788
I couldn't imagine spending Memorial Day
in a more beautiful setting.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.882
And as for my cooking, yes,
I do have an advantage over Ang.

13:12.982 --> 13:15.395
While she was spending years in school...

13:15.495 --> 13:18.731
...studying to become a doctor
and save lives...

13:18.831 --> 13:24.088
...I was working in restaurant kitchens.
So, yes, I can cook. But...

13:24.704 --> 13:27.704
...I am not half the woman Angela is.

13:27.804 --> 13:30.510
- That's very kind.
- Very sweet.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.311
I'll drink to that.

13:32.411 --> 13:36.182
- What about me?
- You, too, Maddie.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.585
Here we go, cheers!

13:38.685 --> 13:42.256
Say... oh, you gotta drink
after you cheers, or it's bad luck.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.725
Green.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.427
It was actually the red one.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.374
The green one had melted already.

13:50.997 --> 13:55.435
Ladies. Both the girls are a sleep, finally.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.937
- Nice.
- And I should take off myself.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.040
I have a half marathon in the morning.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.159
- I should get going, too.
- Why don't you stay in the guest house?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.945
- Really?
- Yeah, don't wake up Maddie.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.881
It'll be fun in the morning,
they'll hang out.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.917
Okay, on one condition.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.702
- Let me help you clean up.
- Oh, my God, no problem.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.458
On that note, Angie, thank you as always.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.593
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you very much.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.789
- I'll run, you know, extra for you.
- Yes, run like the wind.

14:23.889 --> 14:26.515
- Walk me out?
- Oh, sure.

15:19.933 --> 15:23.523
Please, tell me that your mother doesn't
have to come on the fourth, as well.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.226
She hasn't mentioned it.
But I'll tell you what she did mention.

15:27.870 --> 15:30.296
Katie. She doesn't like her.

15:30.396 --> 15:34.434
Really, well, your mother doesn't like
anyone except for you.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.537
- Why, what'd she say?
- It wasn't very clinical.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.100
She said gives her the "willies."

15:41.200 --> 15:44.043
- The willies?
- Yeah, the willies, she used that word.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.761
Thinks there's some sort of disconnect there.

15:50.759 --> 15:53.343
Oh, my God, are you okay?

15:53.443 --> 15:55.848
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:55.948 --> 15:58.851
Oh, my God, you're trembling.
Come on, let's get you...

15:58.951 --> 16:01.023
- ...some fresh air, alright?
- Yeah.

16:01.123 --> 16:03.149
Are you alright, maybe you're getting sick.

16:03.449 --> 16:05.498
- It got kinda chilly out.
- Yeah.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.834
- Are you cozy?
- Thank you.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.128
A little fresh air will do you good.

16:11.228 --> 16:13.890
Doctor's orders, I'll take care of Maddie.

16:17.976 --> 16:21.208
This is a beautiful drawing.
You're really talented.

16:21.308 --> 16:24.517
- Thank you. You can keep that one.
- Really?

16:24.617 --> 16:27.036
- Yeah.
- Thank you, I love it.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.705
What is that?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.111
The only gift my ex ever gave me.

16:38.089 --> 16:39.950
He wasn't a good guy?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.885
No.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.755
Was he abusive?

16:48.974 --> 16:50.158
Yeah.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.429
I'm sorry.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.684
So was he.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.986
And I forgave him every time.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.522
Until Maddie came along.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.459
- He didn't hurt Maddie?
- No.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.396
I didn't want her to witness
what he used to do.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.810
Did you go to the police?

17:12.698 --> 17:15.862
No one would have believed us.
He was a bigshot.

17:15.962 --> 17:18.019
In our world anyway.

17:19.137 --> 17:23.566
So I did what I had to and left.

17:24.676 --> 17:28.544
Maddie and I lived in my car, motels.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.651
And then we found these people who...

17:31.751 --> 17:34.220
...take care of women like me.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.371
They helped us disappear.

17:38.024 --> 17:41.027
I'm just sitting here rambling to you.
I'm so embarrassed.

17:41.127 --> 17:45.212
No, no, no, don't be embarrassed.
I... I understand.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.737
You wanna know my secret?

17:51.437 --> 17:52.987
Yeah.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.359
I'm lousy at making baby's.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.880
What do you mean?

18:01.380 --> 18:04.050
I don't know. I guess I waited too long.

18:04.550 --> 18:10.177
And then we really, really wanted to
have kids and we tried everything, but...

18:10.277 --> 18:12.124
...it didn't really matter.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.028
I had four miscarriages.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.029
Oh, Angela, I'm so sorry.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.829
Yeah, in the end we got an egg donor.

18:19.929 --> 18:23.823
Which is great,
but has its own set of heartaches.

18:23.923 --> 18:26.739
But it took and I got pregnant.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.379
But...

18:28.479 --> 18:31.234
...it was bad. I got really sick.

18:31.334 --> 18:36.381
And so I started self medicating
for the physical pain...

18:36.481 --> 18:39.720
...and then to go to sleep
and then to get through the day.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.506
I got really paranoid. I was a mess.

18:46.257 --> 18:50.163
So then by Cora's first birthday
I checked into the hospital.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.714
So, I'm fine now. You know?

18:55.601 --> 18:59.755
I mean, not that I don't ever think
about grabbing a Xanax.

19:00.239 --> 19:04.051
But I haven't. I haven't and I won't.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.982
Well, I think you're amazing.
And an awesome mom.

19:10.785 --> 19:12.834
Cora is lucky.

19:13.952 --> 19:18.024
Yeah, well, she's about to get luckier.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.659
What?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.528
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

19:21.628 --> 19:24.531
Yeah. Oh, gosh, don't say anything.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.201
I just found out,
I haven't even told Brian yet, so...

19:28.301 --> 19:31.103
No, of course not. Congratulations.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.777
<i>Thanks.</i>

19:50.045 --> 19:51.606
Okay.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.729
It's okay, Mommy's here.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.314
It's okay, it's okay.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.404
Good girl.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.205
Oh, God.

20:46.305 --> 20:51.083
Girls, let's all go down to the fountain.
Everyone, let's go. Come on, girls.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.668
- Are you okay?
- No.

20:55.787 --> 20:59.225
It's happening again.
Okay, we're gonna get out of here, okay?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.575
- Just breathe, I got you.
- I can't believe this.

21:01.675 --> 21:05.265
I'm gonna pick you up. Come on,
come on. Come on, you're okay.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.267
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, God, Linda.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.969
I got you, just breathe, just breathe.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.873
- Come on.
- Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.251
- I can't believe this.
- It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

21:16.351 --> 21:17.996
- Oh, my God.
- Slow.

21:18.096 --> 21:19.611
Oh, my God.

21:28.586 --> 21:30.669
You're gonna be okay, Angie.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.755
I know.

21:34.304 --> 21:37.162
We won't have the family that we wanted.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.666
That we said we would. What you wanted.

21:40.766 --> 21:44.070
Honey, please stop worrying about me.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.372
You're the one that keeps going through hell.

21:46.472 --> 21:50.710
I know, but I just want what you want.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.695
You know, the big family.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.431
A kid in every room.

21:59.284 --> 22:01.135
A son.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.009
I really wanted to give you a son.

22:09.461 --> 22:12.365
And I know what we have is amazing, it is.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.868
What we have is so amazing...

22:15.968 --> 22:20.738
...and to not be grateful, you know...

22:20.838 --> 22:23.676
...I am, I'm so grateful but...

22:23.776 --> 22:26.380
We can always try again, baby.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.650
We're not out of options.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.203
Wait for me!

22:51.303 --> 22:54.740
Cora, Maddie, get changed
and I'll meet you by the pool, okay?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.242
Okay, Daddy.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.161
Hey, guys...

22:58.261 --> 23:00.752
...I have a little announcement to make.

23:02.713 --> 23:04.654
- Maddie and I are moving.
- Hallelujah!

23:05.517 --> 23:07.850
Finally out of that shitty motel!

23:07.950 --> 23:11.147
Yes, but far away. To Colorado.

23:11.247 --> 23:12.424
- Why? Where? What?
- Hell no.

23:12.524 --> 23:13.893
Why?

23:13.993 --> 23:17.696
Well, the contractor that I work for
has put me onto a job there.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.832
And I really need to get out of that motel.

23:19.932 --> 23:24.565
But you can't just leave. I mean, why don't
you just move into our guest house? Right?

23:24.665 --> 23:27.898
- Absolutely.
- Oh, thank you, it's just...

23:27.998 --> 23:30.542
...I gotta take this job.
I really need the money.

23:30.642 --> 23:33.312
Well, why don't you just paint
a mural in Cora's room?

23:33.412 --> 23:37.950
That would be amazing.
And you could also be our part-time nanny.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.252
Oh, you guys don't need a nanny.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.422
Well, we will when I go back to work.

23:43.522 --> 23:46.989
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, I mean, just three days a week.

23:47.089 --> 23:50.429
- And what about Cora?
- Well, I'm not abandoning her...

23:50.529 --> 23:52.865
...I'm just going to work.
You know, part-time.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.334
It's... I'm a doctor, you know,
that's what I do.

23:55.434 --> 23:59.338
It's what we've talked about.
And if you're here, it's so perfect.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.242
She loves you, you love her.
It's really perfect, right?

24:03.342 --> 24:04.811
Right.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.180
Come on, she'd be devastated
if you left, you can't go.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.839
No, you've convinced me, I'll stay.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.229
Thank you.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.950
Brian, are you sure about this?

24:27.050 --> 24:29.335
I mean, Angela's still
getting over the miscarriage...

24:29.435 --> 24:32.104
...and Katie might be nothing
more than a crutch.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.007
Angela shouldn't be making big decisions.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.543
She thinks it'll help with her recovery.

24:37.643 --> 24:41.070
- Which one?
- God, you can be abrasive.

24:41.170 --> 24:44.680
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but she might be walking a tight rope.

24:44.780 --> 24:48.320
She hasn't slipped in over two years.
Not so much as an advil.

24:48.420 --> 24:52.424
And if having her best friend here,
helping us, gives her some comfort...

24:52.524 --> 24:55.201
No, I get that, no. I really do.

24:55.301 --> 24:58.998
But we don't know anything about this girl.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.367
What if it doesn't work out?

25:01.467 --> 25:03.351
It'll be fine, Mom.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.179
Okay, what about the fireworks?

25:13.279 --> 25:15.781
You see, Mother, we have sky rockets...

25:15.881 --> 25:17.413
- ...occasional cherry bomb.
- No.

25:17.513 --> 25:19.664
- And you get a box of sparklers.
- I like that.

25:19.764 --> 25:21.852
- You get your sparklies.
- You're the best.

25:21.952 --> 25:25.037
Can you believe that we've been
doing this for eight years?

25:25.137 --> 25:28.785
- Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?
- So, Katie...

25:28.885 --> 25:31.730
...I just realized I have no idea
where you're from.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.713
Michigan.

25:33.813 --> 25:38.938
Beautiful state. All those lakes.
Is your family still there?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.858
I don't know.

25:40.958 --> 25:45.428
My father left before I was born
and my mom was addicted to drugs, so...

25:45.528 --> 25:47.564
...I was raised in foster care.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.264
I'm so sorry.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.945
So what drew you to these parts?

25:53.045 --> 25:54.320
- Mom, please?
- Donna.

25:54.420 --> 25:58.860
Oh, no, it's okay, it was a job.
Actually, I had no intention of staying.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.827
That's what I hear. So why did you?

26:02.427 --> 26:06.265
Well, I just feel like
I'm part of a family now.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.657
And someone needs to watch
Cora while Angela's working.

26:08.757 --> 26:10.603
And, I mean, Maddie loves her like a sister.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.753
- Yup.
- Yeah.

26:21.112 --> 26:22.392
Angie.

26:28.686 --> 26:30.196
Angie.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.974
You okay?

26:51.141 --> 26:53.761
Baby, I'm sorry, I just...

26:55.113 --> 26:59.218
I just... I can't.
I'm just... It's just too soon.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.920
I'm sorry. I can't.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.222
I just...

27:04.322 --> 27:07.342
I gotta... I just gotta...

28:38.583 --> 28:43.020
- Wow, it's looking great.
- Wow, look at you.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.939
The latest in scrub sheik.

28:46.591 --> 28:49.361
- You okay?
- I'm good.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.397
Well, I mean, I feel a little weird actually.

28:52.497 --> 28:56.109
This is a little bit more difficult
to leave her than I thought it would be.

28:56.209 --> 28:58.904
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna keep her so busy,

28:59.004 --> 29:01.439
Cora's not even gonna know you're gone.

29:05.242 --> 29:07.962
Okay, alright, see ya.

29:17.622 --> 29:19.643
Jackie.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.776
Well, what do you know?

29:24.428 --> 29:27.966
- It's so good to see you!
- Yes!

29:28.066 --> 29:30.736
- Oh, my gosh.
- I missed you.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.722
Oh, my goodness.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.584
Hello.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.656
Hello?

31:50.541 --> 31:52.126
Brian?

31:55.312 --> 31:56.831
Bri?

32:46.297 --> 32:48.116
Did she see us?

32:52.152 --> 32:54.740
Hey, there are my girls.

32:54.840 --> 32:58.443
Hi, baby. Hi, you.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.921
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.248
- What happened?
- Grammy Donna helped us...

33:03.348 --> 33:05.550
...sand castles at the beach.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.186
- No way!
- It was fun!

33:08.286 --> 33:10.989
These two are such angels.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.392
I couldn't have had a better time.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.955
I'm so glad you had a good time.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.499
Give me just one second.
Be right back, girls.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.149
Okay.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.790
- Yeah.
- <i>Can we talk? I'm alone.</i>

33:36.547 --> 33:38.986
I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have brought her here.

33:39.086 --> 33:43.088
No, no, no, no, it is totally my fault.
I got home early and I came out here.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.656
I heard the music,
I wasn't snooping or anything.

33:45.756 --> 33:49.160
But then I came to the window and
I looked in and I kind of freaked out.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.463
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, why? 'Cause it was a woman?

33:51.563 --> 33:54.065
No, I thought it was...

33:54.165 --> 33:56.368
Oh, God, you didn't think it was Brian?

33:56.468 --> 33:59.004
Oh, honey, I would never. I love you.

33:59.104 --> 34:02.140
I know. I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.716
I just... so who was she?

34:04.816 --> 34:08.880
- She's just someone from work. Yeah.
- Yeah, anything serious?

34:08.980 --> 34:12.751
Oh, no. No, I don't have
that luxury after my ex.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.152
- And that goes for men, too.
- Yeah.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.023
You jealous? I'm joking.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.255
- Just close the window next time.
- Yes, I will, sorry.

34:34.038 --> 34:36.157
Good evening, doctor.

34:38.342 --> 34:41.193
- What's this?
- I just...

34:42.143 --> 34:45.094
- ...I love you, that's all.
- Oh, you love me?

34:45.194 --> 34:46.766
Yes.

34:47.621 --> 34:48.654
So much.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.523
- You mean, we're actually, we're actually...
- Everyone's asleep.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.641
- Mom's asleep, kids are asleep?
- Yes.

35:16.213 --> 35:17.765
Hi.

35:18.949 --> 35:20.834
How are you?

35:21.418 --> 35:23.121
I'm good.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.238
You look fabulous.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.361
What, did you bring
the whole damn gym down here?

35:30.461 --> 35:32.320
I would if I could.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.667
Let me make you a little more cozy.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.151
Thanks, honey.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.646
Okay.

35:43.746 --> 35:46.111
Angela knows about us, doesn't she?

35:46.211 --> 35:48.780
That's what you think I wanted to tell you?

35:48.880 --> 35:53.552
- No, she has no idea.
- Okay, good.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.220
Then what is it?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.490
Okay, Angela wants to tell you herself...

35:58.590 --> 36:00.591
- ...so play dumb, okay.
- Okay.

36:00.691 --> 36:03.736
Angela and Brian are gonna
try for another kid.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.831
What, why would she put
herself through that again?

36:06.931 --> 36:10.402
She's not. See, she has one embryo left.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.638
From the same egg donor they used with Cora?

36:13.738 --> 36:17.275
Yes. But she's not gonna risk
carrying it this time.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.425
They're gonna use a surrogate.

36:21.579 --> 36:25.316
Not a stranger, someone they trust.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.511
- Wait, they're gonna ask me?
- No, silly, me.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.061
It really is just such an honor.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.697
Yeah.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.467
Don't you have, like, two miles to swim?

36:42.267 --> 36:45.639
Three, actually, but who's counting?

36:48.472 --> 36:51.109
Hey, are you okay with this?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.278
Yeah, no, of course.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.414
I mean, it's not my business
or my body, I mean...

36:56.514 --> 36:58.516
No, I think it's an amazing idea.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.236
Can you hurry up and go for this swim
so we can go get some breakfast?

37:04.702 --> 37:06.206
Okay?

37:51.001 --> 37:53.241
Wh... what are you doing?

37:54.271 --> 37:56.323
You're gonna freeze.

38:01.345 --> 38:03.253
You don't want me to do it, do you?

38:05.283 --> 38:08.745
Look, I'll tell them no. They'll understand.

38:12.322 --> 38:14.808
Katie, baby, you're scaring me.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.075
I'm the donor.

38:18.595 --> 38:22.417
- What?
- They're my eggs, they're my babies.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.038
What? No. That's impossible.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.707
Cora is mine.

38:29.707 --> 38:32.994
And the baby that they
want you to carry is mine, too.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.583
You have a baby, Maddie.

38:38.683 --> 38:41.087
From my egg, but I didn't carry her.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.189
A lady in Maine did.

38:44.789 --> 38:48.398
She said she wanted a baby
more than anything but she lied.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.645
I had to take her back.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.627
They let you take their baby?

38:56.634 --> 38:58.185
No.

39:06.877 --> 39:09.182
Are you planning on taking Cora, too?

39:10.882 --> 39:14.285
Angela said that she
would never go back to work.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.823
If I wasn't there,
who would be taking care of Cora?

39:18.923 --> 39:20.974
A complete stranger.

39:24.494 --> 39:26.213
You're sick.

39:27.564 --> 39:30.149
Baby, you need help.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.185
No.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.203
I'm sorry, Linda.

40:54.655 --> 40:56.854
Mama, look what I can do.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.841
Why don't you come show me, come on.
Do it on the grass, good girl.

41:06.363 --> 41:08.069
- Do you like Mommy's belly?
- Yeah.

41:08.169 --> 41:10.205
Yeah? You know, there's a baby in there.

41:10.305 --> 41:12.564
Here's what I still don't get.

41:12.664 --> 41:16.873
You spend a year searching
for the perfect donor, and...

41:16.973 --> 41:22.412
...you find someone that's
anonymous and perfect, but...

41:22.512 --> 41:24.622
...when you start looking for a surrogate...

41:24.722 --> 41:27.579
...you ask the runaway in your guest house.

41:27.979 --> 41:30.922
Linda's girlfriend, no less.

41:31.022 --> 41:35.108
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on. It's so obvious.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.697
Katie's been an incredible friend.

41:39.797 --> 41:44.259
And she has signed every single document
we've put in front of her.

41:44.609 --> 41:47.772
I mean, she's been great.
She nursed me through my miscarriage...

41:47.872 --> 41:50.841
...and, you know,
she was really amazing to me...

41:50.941 --> 41:53.978
...when Linda got killed
in that boating accident.

41:55.297 --> 41:58.416
I know, honey, I understand, it's great.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.586
Katie's a strong shoulder to lean on.

42:01.686 --> 42:05.161
She's even a wonderful nurse.
But tell me this...

42:06.061 --> 42:08.393
...what does she get out of it?

42:08.493 --> 42:13.498
$40,000, and the fact
that she's helping out a friend.

42:13.598 --> 42:16.567
Listen, I'm happy she's here.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.601
It's good to keep an eye on her
when she's carrying my child.

42:19.701 --> 42:22.915
Yeah, but what are you gonna do
after she gives birth?

42:23.941 --> 42:27.748
You better kick her out
or that's gonna be one confused kid.

42:28.015 --> 42:29.579
Really.

42:30.481 --> 42:34.935
What if Katie bonds with it
and doesn't wanna give it up?

42:36.019 --> 42:38.490
Will Katie have visitation rights?

42:39.890 --> 42:41.426
Well...

42:42.226 --> 42:45.096
Have you thought any of this through?

42:45.196 --> 42:47.832
Yes, yes, of course. We've talked about it.

42:47.932 --> 42:50.535
You know, honestly we don't know
all the answers now.

42:50.635 --> 42:54.674
It's not a black and white situation.
But we're figuring it out.

42:58.808 --> 43:00.611
- Alright, look... no, wait...
- You know what, Donna.

43:00.711 --> 43:06.283
Please, please, please. Can I...
I can't... I gotta get Cora to go.

43:06.383 --> 43:09.787
Girls, did you wanna come on up
so we can do that thing?

43:09.887 --> 43:11.789
- Sorry.
- It's okay, no problem, sweetheart.

43:11.889 --> 43:14.212
I got it. You sit here, enjoy.

43:18.862 --> 43:21.366
Isn't it a little early
in the day to be drinking?

43:21.466 --> 43:23.469
It's four o'clock, it's happy hour.

43:24.569 --> 43:29.376
You know, whatever my mom said,
she can't help it. Just ignore her.

43:29.740 --> 43:32.076
She thinks Katie's gonna screw us over.

43:32.176 --> 43:34.074
I'll talk to her.

43:34.174 --> 43:37.983
- Are you worried?
- If our lawyer isn't, I'm not.

43:38.483 --> 43:42.351
- She's very beautiful, isn't she?
- Who? My mom?

43:43.129 --> 43:44.671
Katie.

43:48.758 --> 43:50.276
Hideous.

43:52.879 --> 43:55.450
Your mother thinks
she was sleeping with Linda.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.836
My mom thinks Katie was sleeping with Linda?

43:58.936 --> 44:01.873
Yes, that she was the one
in the guest house that time.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.991
Do you believe her?

44:06.976 --> 44:08.779
Let's go to the swing!

44:08.879 --> 44:10.415
Okay.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.599
Look, there are your friends, go play.

44:14.384 --> 44:15.989
How far along are you?

44:16.089 --> 44:18.528
- Four months.
- Boy or a girl?

44:18.628 --> 44:21.666
I do not know, I find out tomorrow.
I have the amnio test.

44:21.766 --> 44:25.463
Good luck. I fainted during mine.
I should have sued.

44:25.563 --> 44:29.267
- How old are your girls?
- Almost four, both of them.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.837
Twins, wow! Can't imagine.

44:33.237 --> 44:36.140
Well, hey, hats off.
They're beautiful, they look just like you.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.484
Thank you. Yeah, I get that all the time.

44:40.711 --> 44:43.581
- Mama!
- Hi, baby.

44:43.921 --> 44:48.119
How's my big girl? I missed you so much.

44:48.219 --> 44:51.602
Did you have a good day, sweetie? Yeah?

44:51.702 --> 44:53.324
Let's go, Maddie.

44:53.424 --> 44:55.993
Hey, guess what? The animal show's on.

44:56.093 --> 44:59.163
- You relax, I'll take them.
- No, I got it.

44:59.263 --> 45:03.742
- I want you to do it, Katie.
- She's used to me. Okay, girls, let's go!

45:05.569 --> 45:07.087
Patterson.

45:08.204 --> 45:09.499
Patterson.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.084
Why are we doing this again?

45:19.784 --> 45:23.655
To make sure the fetus
has no chromosome abnormalities.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.725
I know, but, isn't that for women over 35?

45:27.825 --> 45:32.463
Yeah, usually. But this isn't about
your body, it's about the egg.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.833
So it has nothing to do with me?

45:35.333 --> 45:37.101
That's not what I meant.

45:37.201 --> 45:41.179
They're gonna stick a needle right into
my uterus where my baby is sleeping.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.190
Your baby?

45:44.824 --> 45:46.718
That's not what I meant.

45:48.278 --> 45:49.796
Morgan.

45:55.952 --> 45:58.805
Put your feet up. Very good.

46:00.657 --> 46:02.509
Looking good.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.930
Alright now.

46:06.130 --> 46:09.013
You might feel a little twinge...

46:09.547 --> 46:12.203
...a little cramping. But that's okay.

46:12.753 --> 46:14.337
We expect that.

46:15.572 --> 46:17.456
Looking good.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.636
I'm sorry.

46:30.287 --> 46:35.340
- What do you mean you're sorry?
- The infection has spread to both ovaries.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.595
She won't be able to donate again?

46:37.695 --> 46:41.999
These are the last three eggs
she'll ever produce.

46:42.099 --> 46:43.934
You said it'd be safe.

46:44.034 --> 46:46.328
I'm so sorry, Tara.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.222
You said this would be safe!

46:51.942 --> 46:54.153
You said it was safe!

46:54.253 --> 46:58.049
Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie!
It's okay, it's over.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.918
It's over. It's over, it's okay.

47:01.018 --> 47:04.055
Everything's okay. Everything's okay.

47:04.155 --> 47:07.324
You and the baby both did great. Great!

47:07.424 --> 47:09.961
And we'll have the results back
in 10 to 14 days.

47:10.061 --> 47:12.430
Yeah, we'll even know the sex.

47:12.530 --> 47:15.191
Look, I'm gonna let you two be alone.

47:22.872 --> 47:24.424
Angela.

47:26.404 --> 47:28.378
What was that?

47:28.478 --> 47:32.016
She has been a nervous wreck all day long...

47:32.116 --> 47:34.351
...and now she's experiencing more cramping.

47:34.451 --> 47:38.055
So I think we should give her
something for the pain...

47:38.155 --> 47:41.532
- ...and maybe something for anxiety.
- I agree.

47:41.632 --> 47:44.161
- Yeah?
- Yes, absolutely.

47:44.261 --> 47:48.599
- I should write some for myself after that.
- I know, right?

47:48.699 --> 47:51.869
That was nutty, right? That was... that was...

47:51.969 --> 47:55.406
Okay, stay calm.
We'll be calm, it'll all be okay.

47:55.506 --> 47:58.549
- You'll be okay, stay calm.
- Gotta keep her calm.

47:58.649 --> 48:00.488
- Yeah, keep her calm.
- Thanks so much.

48:00.588 --> 48:02.389
- Of course.
- Take care, see ya.

48:05.382 --> 48:09.487
I just think I'm going insane.
I feel like I'm losing my mind or something.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.622
And now it's all off your chest.

48:12.122 --> 48:13.691
Right?

48:13.973 --> 48:18.817
Yes. I guess, I mean,
we talked about it all, and...

48:19.396 --> 48:21.666
...she had an answer for everything.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.284
That made sense?

48:25.802 --> 48:27.687
I guess.

48:30.306 --> 48:32.546
We're gonna have a beautiful baby.

48:33.177 --> 48:36.247
And then Katie's gonna move on
with her life...

48:36.847 --> 48:40.834
...and everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to. I promise.

48:45.221 --> 48:46.773
Okay.

49:09.412 --> 49:12.516
Wha... what's going on here?

49:12.616 --> 49:15.853
It's the first day of school,
you're dressed exactly alike.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.845
- Who dressed you?
- Us.

49:17.945 --> 49:20.068
No way.

49:20.168 --> 49:23.394
- People are gonna think you're sisters.
- We are sisters.

49:23.494 --> 49:26.296
No, you're not sisters,
you're just best friends.

49:26.396 --> 49:29.077
Mommy said we're sisters.

49:29.177 --> 49:32.038
I said like sisters, silly.

49:33.903 --> 49:36.774
Oh, that's so great. Come on, you guys ready?

49:36.874 --> 49:38.709
- Yeah.
- Alright, we gotta go.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.627
Big, big, big, big day.

49:43.046 --> 49:45.294
Come on, watch out, watch your head.

49:55.191 --> 49:56.902
Mama.

49:57.002 --> 50:02.115
I'm sorry, baby. Just think how pretty
it's gonna look when we're done. Okay?

50:15.745 --> 50:17.715
Just a couple peas, okay?

50:17.815 --> 50:20.784
Is that good? That's good.

50:20.884 --> 50:22.944
- How's that corn, you like the corn?
- Yummy.

50:23.044 --> 50:25.400
- You wanna try a little corn for me, baby?
- You love corn.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.271
It's so good, watch out.
Watch out, that's good.

50:28.371 --> 50:30.628
Awesome, those are the best.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.311
Alright.

50:35.064 --> 50:38.488
Here, baby, some more peas. There ya go.

50:44.107 --> 50:47.878
- We went too dark, didn't we?
- That's not your real color?

50:47.978 --> 50:52.316
No, we started dying our hair after we left.

50:52.416 --> 50:56.254
I'll probably stop doing it now.
It's just that we're so used to it.

50:56.854 --> 50:59.664
- What's Maddie's natural color?
- Oh, dark brown.

50:59.764 --> 51:02.086
- Like me!
- Yeah.

51:05.128 --> 51:07.972
Three weeks to go, it's pretty amazing?

51:08.072 --> 51:11.169
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

51:12.269 --> 51:14.371
You know, Ang, I was wondering,
seeing as we're so close...

51:14.471 --> 51:17.274
...when were you planning
on taking your maternity leave?

51:17.374 --> 51:21.279
- What makes you think I am?
- Oh, well, you did last time.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.160
Yeah, but...

51:23.260 --> 51:27.478
...you know, last time I was recovering
from a life-threatening pregnancy.

51:27.818 --> 51:29.720
Oh, do you regret taking the time off?

51:29.820 --> 51:33.441
No, of course not.
We're just doing it differently this time.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.676
Different how?

51:37.961 --> 51:43.334
Well, for the first few weeks
we're hiring a night nurse and then...

51:43.434 --> 51:45.536
...we're gonna find someone more permanent.

51:45.636 --> 51:46.804
You're okay with this?

51:46.904 --> 51:50.726
Yeah, she's happiest when she's working
and I support her 100 percent.

51:52.676 --> 51:55.045
You know, you guys
wouldn't have to hire anyone.

51:55.145 --> 51:58.048
I mean, I'm more than happy
to postpone my trip.

51:58.148 --> 52:03.153
Well, we just... I just think it would
be better all the way around if...

52:03.253 --> 52:05.656
...if a complete stranger raises your kids?

52:05.756 --> 52:07.654
Yeah, I can see that.

52:10.659 --> 52:13.746
Excuse me. Girls, come on, bath time.

52:14.764 --> 52:17.900
Let's go, come on. Cora.

52:25.943 --> 52:30.029
Doesn't she understand that it is
actually none of her business?

52:32.148 --> 52:35.119
She was raised in foster homes...

52:35.219 --> 52:37.821
...and she believes in attachment parenting.

52:37.921 --> 52:42.459
It's... it's understandable.
I'm actually glad she gives a shit.

52:42.559 --> 52:46.296
Really? Well, maybe we should
take her up on what she's offering...

52:46.396 --> 52:48.800
...and we could all be one big happy family.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.018
Alright.

52:53.936 --> 52:56.573
Where is this coming from?
I thought you guys worked it out?

52:56.673 --> 52:59.292
- Alright, alright, alright.
- Brian.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.530
Tara...

55:12.245 --> 55:14.330
...what do you want?

55:26.923 --> 55:31.017
But... there was never
supposed to be contact.

55:31.117 --> 55:36.041
What kind of mother sits in the bath
and drinks while her baby cries?

55:38.167 --> 55:39.604
Who are you?

55:40.204 --> 55:42.206
I gave you that child.

55:43.006 --> 55:45.633
You said you wanted
nothing more in this world.

55:46.643 --> 55:48.929
- Where's Maddie?
- No, you lied!

57:13.997 --> 57:15.815
Can I come in?

57:16.999 --> 57:18.818
One second!

57:21.437 --> 57:23.256
I've got your juice.

57:24.573 --> 57:26.092
Fine.

57:32.815 --> 57:36.454
Listen... listen, about last night.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.280
It's not what you think.

57:39.380 --> 57:41.490
I know what I saw.

57:41.591 --> 57:43.961
- You're a drug addict.
- No, I'm not.

57:44.061 --> 57:47.130
Listen, after your amnio,
I started panicking.

57:47.230 --> 57:49.900
You were freaking out,
it made me really anxious.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.704
Do you ask my doctor for drugs?

57:54.204 --> 57:56.641
Yeah, well, I didn't take one.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.676
Yeah, and you expect me to believe that.

57:59.776 --> 58:01.733
It's the truth.

58:01.833 --> 58:04.171
I threw the whole bottle away.
If you don't believe me...

58:04.271 --> 58:08.167
You're pathetic. Leave me alone.

59:45.047 --> 59:48.134
"Your nose should be developed.
Your eyes might even be open."

01:01:42.264 --> 01:01:45.706
Hey, why aren't you sleeping in the bed?
What are you doing?

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:50.540
I was... I was just doing
research for a patient.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.910
Jiminy crickets, it's late.
I gotta get to work.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.863
Good morning.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:07.570
One, two, yay!

01:02:08.345 --> 01:02:11.328
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Pancakes.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:14.011
Okay, what would you like on your pancakes?

01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:15.999
Strawberries.

01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:19.703
Blueberries and grapes.

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.855
And... okay, I think I can make that happen.

01:02:26.274 --> 01:02:28.316
- Baby, hop off for a minute.
- Okay.

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.429
Up here. Good girl.

01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:53.517
Come on, baby, let's get some breakfast.

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.168
Come on.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:07.884
Oh, my God. You girls scared me. Hi!

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:11.237
I'll be out in a second.
I'll be out in a second.

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.065
I got the big rock.

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.237
Here I come.

01:03:29.337 --> 01:03:31.574
Oh, baby, come here. Sweetie, come here.

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:35.578
Oh, honey, it's okay. Oh, Mama's here.

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:38.214
- Mama's here, it's okay.
- Cora, what's wrong?

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:41.384
- She just bumped her head.
- What happened? What happened, baby?

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:46.122
- I bumped heads with Maddie.
- Oh, and where does it hurt?

01:03:46.587 --> 01:03:49.025
Oh, there, where else?

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.594
There. She really got ya?

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:54.564
- Is she okay?
- Yes, she's okay.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.667
You're okay, right?
Maddie didn't mean to hurt you.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.303
You know that. Such a brave girl.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:04.087
Does it hurt here? Does it hurt here?
Maybe it hurts here.

01:04:04.187 --> 01:04:08.001
Come on, let's go inside. Let's get you
some neosporin, what do ya say?

01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:11.214
What do you think about that?
Such a brave girl.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.749
Let's go inside.

01:04:47.182 --> 01:04:49.434
I'll be with you in a minute, Maddie.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:55.425
What the fuck was that?
"It's okay, baby, mama's here?"

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:57.594
- Nothing, I...
- She's not your daughter.

01:04:57.694 --> 01:05:00.487
- Are you okay? You're a little...
- You keep acting like she's yours.

01:05:00.587 --> 01:05:02.966
Okay, that's just stupid.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.669
Come to think of it, when was
the last time you ran her a bath...

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:08.037
...took her to school or gave her breakfast?

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:11.074
Are you kidding me? I'm working.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:14.744
That's why I hired you,
that's why I pay you! This is your job!

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:17.547
Yeah, to raise one of your kids
and carry the other.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.549
How fucking dare you.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:22.251
You obviously feel guilty about it.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.554
Spying, snooping.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:28.591
Did you find what you were looking for
when you broke into my room?

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:33.097
You're hiding something.
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.500
You were supposed to be on your way to work.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.869
Yeah, so were you.

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:43.957
- Is everything okay?
- Angela thinks I'm hiding something.

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.810
Little does she know, she's right.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.961
Honey, I really wanted it to be a surprise.
But let me show you.

01:05:50.061 --> 01:05:52.762
Mom's already upstairs preparing it.
Come on, you're gonna love this.

01:05:52.862 --> 01:05:56.534
Come on, let's go.
You're gonna love this. You'll see.

01:06:01.356 --> 01:06:04.653
- Hey, Mom. Still kicking ass?
- Oh, you bet ya.

01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:08.898
Okay, so, Katie designed it,
Mom bought the furniture...

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:12.885
...and this is the best part.
Just picked it up from the framers.

01:06:15.537 --> 01:06:18.246
Gabriel. You...

01:06:18.948 --> 01:06:21.978
- ...you picked out a name?
- Baby, we did, remember?

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:25.782
No, sweetheart, that was one
out of the three that we discussed.

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:29.085
- I think it's perfect.
- I don't give a shit what you think.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.488
What else do you two talk about
when I'm not around?

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:33.429
Angela, come on, what is this?

01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:36.793
Lately they've been talking a lot
about how worried they are about you.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:39.996
Oh, really. Have they?

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.802
So I guess that you told them, didn't you?

01:06:42.902 --> 01:06:46.428
- I actually didn't. Maybe I should have.
- Told... told me what?

01:06:46.528 --> 01:06:48.585
- She's been using again.
- Oh, no.

01:06:48.685 --> 01:06:50.773
That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.342
- You're not high right now?
- No, of course not.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:58.515
I'm upset because I caught her referring
to herself as Cora's mother this morning.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:01.017
Cora bumped her head. I was consoling her.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:04.921
Yes, as her mother! Which you are not.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.525
She said that I was going
to abandon her, Cora.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:13.259
She said this straight to my face. I'm sorry,
we don't know anything about this woman.

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:16.900
We don't know what she's capable of. I'm
sorry, we don't know enough about her past.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.037
- We know she's fled an abusive marriage.
- Yes, yes, we do.

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.773
And if she disappeared once,
she can disappear again.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.761
Angela, just stop, okay?

01:07:26.861 --> 01:07:28.753
And what about Linda?

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.950
- You were fucking her, weren't you?
- Come on.

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:35.518
You named it, you called it. That was her
in the guest room that time, wasn't it?

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:38.697
Yes, and if you had asked me,
I would've told you.

01:07:38.797 --> 01:07:41.724
I did ask you. I asked you
straight to your face and you lied.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:45.028
Did you or did you not know
that Linda was gonna be our surrogate?

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:48.787
- Angela, stop it!
- Was Linda's death an accident?

01:07:48.886 --> 01:07:52.038
Or maybe you wanted to get rid
of her and carry our baby.

01:07:52.138 --> 01:07:55.104
- Enough!
- Tell me! Answer me this question!

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.666
- Please can you...
- Answer me this question!

01:07:57.766 --> 01:08:01.774
- Brian, the baby. Can you just stop, please?
- Make her answer. She's faking it.

01:08:02.026 --> 01:08:05.348
You knew it! You called it
from day one. She's a liar!

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.697
She's faking, don't you... Oh, my, God.

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:14.472
Make her answer the question!
Answer the question!

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:20.145
Just get some rest, Katie, okay?

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:28.285
She's fine, they're both fine.
But I want her in my office tomorrow at 10.

01:08:28.385 --> 01:08:30.602
We'll do some additional tests.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:39.412
I mean...

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.772
You've put our baby's life at risk.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.158
What if he's already at risk?

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:53.314
- What if he's at risk right now?
- Look at me, look at me.

01:08:53.415 --> 01:08:55.865
Look at me. Are you on something right now?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.975
- No. No. No!
- Yes or no? No?

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:02.783
- You accused her of murder.
- I asked her a question.

01:09:02.883 --> 01:09:05.341
- Why couldn't she answer it?
- You endangered the baby.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:09.212
Katie has grounds for keeping him now.
Do you understand that?

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:12.397
I don't wanna lose my son, Angela.

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:15.285
I don't wanna lose you.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.703
Listen. Brian...

01:09:18.804 --> 01:09:20.966
...I am not on anything right now.

01:09:21.067 --> 01:09:24.006
I got that prescription for Katie
because she was freaking out.

01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:28.144
I have not taken one. I threw the whole
thing away unopened, I swear it.

01:09:28.243 --> 01:09:30.616
I swear it on Cora's life.

01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:36.073
Prove it, I want a urine sample.

01:09:39.173 --> 01:09:42.245
- Really?
- And then I want you to apologize to Katie.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:46.031
I don't care what you say
but you have to make this right.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.518
Shit.

01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:28.905
- You cut your hand.
- Yeah, chopping the carrots.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:31.090
You need to be real careful.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.626
Here you go.

01:13:35.877 --> 01:13:37.380
Thanks.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.059
I'm really truly sorry...

01:13:41.159 --> 01:13:43.818
...and profoundly embarrassed.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.701
I don't know, somehow seeing you like that.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.559
Carrying my child, it's...

01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:53.496
I mean, they warned you about this.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.924
You know, they say the moment
that it really hits you. I mean...

01:13:57.024 --> 01:14:01.838
...my child is always gonna be half
Brian's and half someone else's.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:06.299
And for some reason with Cora it was okay
even though it was someone else's DNA.

01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:10.880
At least I carried her, it was my womb.
We had that time to bond.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:16.109
And now it's just, you know,
not my egg, not my body.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.724
All I could do was watch.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:25.178
I just... I thought I could handle this.
I just don't know what my place is.

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:30.633
I... I don't know, that's why I got
the prescription. I just started panicking.

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.370
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:36.439
You accused me
of some pretty terrible things.

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:40.443
I know, I know. I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:42.627
Please forgive me.

01:14:43.878 --> 01:14:45.463
Yes.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:52.515
Brian wants me to give him a urine sample.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.608
Let me get you the cup.

01:15:07.235 --> 01:15:08.971
Thank you.

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:12.687
- For accepting Angela's apology.
- Of course.

01:15:12.787 --> 01:15:16.461
Well, the last thing I want is for her
to question either one of us.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.163
Katie...

01:15:26.263 --> 01:15:30.130
...if she were using,
why would she have given the sample?

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.981
I know, but... let's just be sure.

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:33.556
<i>Hello, my name is Monica Wheeler.</i>

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.105
<i>And if you're considering
anonymous egg donations...</i>

01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:38.827
<i>...please consider amazing possibilities.</i>

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:42.485
<i>We have state of the art facilities
and the finest physicians.</i>

01:16:42.585 --> 01:16:44.641
<i>You will be in great hands.</i>

01:17:02.449 --> 01:17:05.588
- Okay.
- <i>Amazing Possibilities.</i>

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:09.358
Hi there, may I speak
with Monica Wheeler, please?

01:17:10.381 --> 01:17:14.568
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Wheeler passed away,
but maybe I can help you with something?</i>

01:17:14.668 --> 01:17:18.082
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. When?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.071
<i>Four years ago now.</i>

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:24.007
May I ask how?

01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:26.658
<i>It was ruled a suicide.</i>

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:29.994
Suicide?

01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:33.349
You don't sound so convinced.

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:35.862
<i>No, Monica loved life.</i>

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:40.257
<i>Anyway, is there something else
I can help you out with?</i>

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:44.025
Yes.

01:17:44.425 --> 01:17:45.928
Yes.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:50.533
I... I worked with a donor
of yours a few years back.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.835
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Yeah.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:57.146
And I know there's a strict
policy of anonymity, but...

01:17:57.246 --> 01:18:00.843
...I'm concerned that the donor
has found her way into my life.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:04.213
<i>Ma'am, if you're asking for the identity
of a donor, I'm afraid I can't.</i>

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:06.655
Listen, I think she may be mentally unwell.

01:18:06.755 --> 01:18:09.767
Possibly dangerous. Please.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.837
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:18.009
Yes, of course, I understand.

01:18:19.894 --> 01:18:24.266
Let me ask you another question.
You know the mural in Monica's office?

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.756
You know, the real beautiful one
with the tree of life?

01:18:27.856 --> 01:18:31.206
I love it, so I was wondering,
could you tell me the name of the artist?

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.991
- <i>I can't.</i>
- Why not?

01:18:34.642 --> 01:18:36.928
<i>The artist was one of our donors.</i>

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.067
Thank you.

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:57.366
Hey, Ang, long time no see.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:19:01.620
Listen, I have a favor to ask. I need
a DNA test, how fast can you do that?

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.006
It might take a moment
but I'll make the call.

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.609
Okay, would a hair sample do?

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:09.074
<i>Only if you get the root, saliva's better.</i>

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:12.597
Right, right, okay, thanks.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.722
Let me help you with that.

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:57.214
You shouldn't be cutting anything
with that nasty cut on your hand.

01:19:57.314 --> 01:20:00.073
- Yeah, you're probably right, thanks.
- I got it.

01:20:00.173 --> 01:20:02.214
Here's your juice, girls.

01:20:04.031 --> 01:20:06.502
You guys are being so quiet this morning.

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:11.006
Here ya go, have some juice.
What ya doing? Who's this?

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:13.941
A doggy.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:17.246
What's your favorite animal, guys?

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:20.449
Mine is a unicorn.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:23.519
Mine is a... mine is a horsy.

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:26.822
A unicorn, a horsy. Is it the one
that's got the... what's it called?

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:30.359
- The horn.
- The horn. Take one more little sip.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.355
One more little sip, finish that up.

01:20:38.032 --> 01:20:39.902
Good girl.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.904
- Where does your fish go?
- Ploop, ploop.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:46.302
Ploop, ploop, that's a good one. Alright.

01:20:46.402 --> 01:20:48.803
That's good, girls. Watch this.

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:53.488
Alright, you done with this, guys?
Oh, good job, good job.

01:20:55.049 --> 01:20:57.486
To go cup for a woman on the go.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:59.637
Oh, thank you.

01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:02.707
- Yeah.
- Oh, thanks.

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.245
Girls, finish that.

01:21:09.063 --> 01:21:11.100
I'll clean up, it's okay.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.035
I have to get ready.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.420
Have fun.

01:21:46.233 --> 01:21:47.686
Hey, what's going on?

01:21:47.786 --> 01:21:51.139
I feel like I need to spend more time
with Cora so I decided to take the day off.

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.498
- I'm gonna take the girls to the zoo.
- Alright!

01:21:53.698 --> 01:21:57.246
- We're going to the zoo!
- Oh, my God, you guys, that's so amazing.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:02.166
- Ready to go to the zoo? Come on, let's do it.
- Have a good time. Give Mom a kiss.

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.444
Have a good time.

01:22:05.544 --> 01:22:09.442
- Have fun, girls! See you guys later!
- Come on, girls. Here we go, here we go!

01:22:13.599 --> 01:22:14.855
Hey, Bar.

01:22:14.955 --> 01:22:16.966
Hey, Angie, do me a favor,
give me a second, okay?

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:20.270
Yup, yup. No problem.

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:29.778
- Hey, how are ya?
- Okay.

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:34.365
- Busy morning?
- Yeah, yeah. A little crazy. So...

01:22:35.883 --> 01:22:39.988
If you could see if these are a match...

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.690
...as soon as possible.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.892
I'll get these started
and we'll know soon enough.

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:47.796
- Great, thanks, Barry.
- Great. Hey, we gonna do lunch?

01:22:48.334 --> 01:22:50.278
- Not today, next week.
- Okay.

01:22:50.378 --> 01:22:52.234
Thanks, Bar.

01:24:37.586 --> 01:24:39.150
Shit.

01:26:04.725 --> 01:26:06.462
Surprise!

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:11.066
- What is this?
- It's the baby shower, it's your shower.

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:15.837
Let me guess. This was her idea.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:19.908
Listen, look, Angela, come on. Look... Katie
spent the whole night putting this together.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.444
She wanted it to be perfect.
She wanted you to feel special.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:26.314
Really? Is that how you
wanted me to feel? Special?

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:28.316
- Angela, look...
- Special?

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:31.438
- What are you doing?
- She's trying to kill me.

01:26:32.254 --> 01:26:34.656
- Oh, God.
- She's drugged me.

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:39.460
You tell him what you did right now and you
will not spend the rest of your life in jail!

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.985
- Tell him right now!
- Stop! Stop!

01:26:41.085 --> 01:26:44.766
She's Cora's biological mother
and Gabriel's, too.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:48.603
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Katie is our donor, she's our donor.

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.613
- Everybody, look...
- She's trying to edge me out!

01:26:50.713 --> 01:26:54.146
- You are an addict! You are an addict!
- Listen! Look it, look at this picture!

01:26:54.246 --> 01:26:57.206
- That is her! That is her at five.
- Everybody, you gotta get out.

01:26:57.306 --> 01:27:00.916
You're cheating on me because you cheated,
'cause you said you weren't gonna take drugs!

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:04.019
Out, out. Everybody out.
Come on, we gotta go. Everybody out.

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:06.923
Party's over, party's over.

01:27:07.923 --> 01:27:10.392
- Damn it!
- Let me talk to her.

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:13.528
Please, let me go speak to her.
You just... I will take care of this.

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:16.681
I will take care of this, okay.
Let me talk to her.

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:35.353
- You stay away from me.
- Or what?

01:27:35.853 --> 01:27:38.102
You're gonna kill me?

01:27:39.186 --> 01:27:41.005
Kill us?

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.926
I saw the mural that you put
in Monica Wheeler's office.

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.333
Is that how you got access
to our personal files?

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:52.991
Yes.

01:27:56.971 --> 01:28:00.476
Why are you doing this?
Have you been doing this to other families?

01:28:00.576 --> 01:28:04.384
- Is Maddie even yours?
- Yes, she is.

01:28:05.135 --> 01:28:08.399
So is Cora and Gabriel.

01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:11.887
I didn't do this for the money.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:16.024
I gave my eggs so my babies
would be taken care of.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:21.011
Taken care of by women whose
only dream was to have a baby.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.934
You lied. You all lied.

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:30.187
You sacrificed nothing.
I sacrificed everything.

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:34.443
Now I get to carry my last egg.

01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:37.014
My baby.

01:28:39.046 --> 01:28:40.883
You need help.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.552
Now, come on, after that
little performance out there...

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:47.122
...they think you're
the only one that needs help.

01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:51.129
Katie, no one's going to believe you.
The truth will come out.

01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:53.928
You just told all your friends.

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.731
None of them believed you.

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:57.801
Yeah.

01:28:58.356 --> 01:29:00.615
Well, DNA doesn't lie.

01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:06.024
I'd rather die than have
my child be raised by you.

01:29:09.423 --> 01:29:13.246
What are you doing? What is wrong with you?

01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:17.219
- You just tried to kill me.
- What?

01:29:17.319 --> 01:29:18.856
Brian!

01:29:19.579 --> 01:29:21.582
Oh, my God!

01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:23.944
Stop that! Don't!

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.442
I'm here, baby.

01:30:14.112 --> 01:30:15.978
I'm here.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.096
Don't... don't talk. Just...

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.716
Brian.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.820
I just heard. How is she?

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.577
I need you to see this.

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.062
I just... I need you to read this.

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.134
Just read it.

01:31:00.754 --> 01:31:02.639
Oh, my God.

01:31:04.591 --> 01:31:07.394
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.446
She's gone.

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:44.982
When?

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.851
Last night.

01:31:48.535 --> 01:31:50.988
God, Brian, I'm so sorry.

01:31:53.173 --> 01:31:55.058
You're sorry.

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.316
No, would you please stay?

01:32:01.416 --> 01:32:04.152
No, I have to go to Cora and to Maddie.

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:07.740
- Please, don't... don't move.
- Please... would you please hold me...

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.841
...please? Please?

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.385
Please?

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:26.490
She was gonna kill the baby.

01:32:28.475 --> 01:32:30.286
I had no choice.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.143
Will you ever forgive me?

01:32:35.993 --> 01:32:38.057
You did what you had to do.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.689
Back in bed now, lie down.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:44.779
Oh, God, Brian I don't want this C-section.

01:32:44.879 --> 01:32:47.429
The baby's in distress,
we don't have any choice.

01:32:47.529 --> 01:32:50.565
- Stay with me.
- You and Gabriel are in good hands.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:54.084
Stay with me, the whole time, please.

01:32:56.036 --> 01:32:57.922
I love you.

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.278
Katie, hi, it's Dr. Weisman.

01:33:03.378 --> 01:33:06.781
I want you to know everything's
gonna be alright, okay?

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.783
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:11.954
Alright, then let's do this.
We're gonna count down from 10.

01:33:12.554 --> 01:33:16.157
10, nine, eight...

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:20.930
...seven, six, five...

01:33:52.759 --> 01:33:56.729
- What happened? Where is he?
- There were complications.

01:33:56.829 --> 01:33:58.166
Where is Gabriel?

01:33:58.266 --> 01:34:00.768
He's okay, Katie,
he's just being observed, that's all.

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:03.218
Take me to see him. Please!

01:34:03.418 --> 01:34:06.421
Yes, of course. I'll take you to him now.

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:10.411
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He'll be fine.

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.948
And the girls, how are the girls?

01:34:13.248 --> 01:34:16.701
In time, we'll all be fine.

01:34:18.852 --> 01:34:22.045
Where is he? Where is he?

01:34:31.865 --> 01:34:33.668
You okay?

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.986
I wanna see my baby.

01:34:51.451 --> 01:34:54.738
- He's beautiful.
- Yes, he is.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.912
I want you to take a good look...

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.850
...'cause it's your last.

01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:08.970
I don't understand.

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:12.131
You will. Soon enough.

01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:06.156
What?

01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:27.497
No! Please...

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:22.746
Hi.

01:38:24.831 --> 01:38:26.716
Oh, my God.

01:38:31.204 --> 01:38:33.023
What's this?

01:38:35.642 --> 01:38:37.494
Oh, baby.

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.562
Oh, my God.

01:38:45.083 --> 01:38:49.035
Sweetheart, it's so beautiful.
That's so sweet.

01:38:49.585 --> 01:38:52.459
Thank you. I love you so much.

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:57.114
I love it.
