00:45.410 --> 00:47.401
*

01:03.890 --> 01:05.380
COMPUTER VOICE:
FIrst stage.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.787
Number one.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.298
Every single time.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.854
Because you cheat.
How do I cheat?

01:40.900 --> 01:43.221
You pick the same song
every single time.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.396
You just mad because I kicked
your ass,

01:44.430 --> 01:45.089
like, 50 times in a row.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.360
Because it was the same song.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.059
"Waa, waa, same song."

01:48.100 --> 01:48.896
I need some real competition.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.805
Anybody dare
to challenge the king?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.330
I will.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.904
You serious, lady?

01:53.940 --> 01:55.908
You may want to watch how this
is done a few times.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.805
No, no, that's all right.
One time is all I need.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.511
Hold this.

02:00.550 --> 02:01.869
Don't let him pick
the same song.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.411
Oh, that's okay,
I like his song.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.414
COMPUTER VOICE:
First stage.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.885
You ready?

02:11.930 --> 02:13.750
Oh, I don't need a screen.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.606
WOMAN:
No way. No way.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.780
Want to go again?

02:41.820 --> 02:42.957
Come on.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.652
He's out.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.767
So you heading out?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.928
Yeah, Maya's got
a summer school open house.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.801
Lot of construction paper suns
and moons, huh?

02:56.840 --> 02:58.933
More like composting strategies

02:58.970 --> 03:01.871
and micro-investment
lemonade stands.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.204
Oh, here she is now.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.218
Hi, honey.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.877
What?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.649
Maya, what?

03:10.690 --> 03:11.645
Slow down.

03:11.690 --> 03:13.749
Jay, something's happened.
Bring up the news.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.222
Okay, okay.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.862
I'm

03:24.900 --> 03:26.231
It's gonna be okay.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.591
Okay. She heard two blasts

03:28.640 --> 03:29.959
and then the sirens;
it's close to our place.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.001
What do you think?
Methane

03:32.040 --> 03:33.974
Those two are on the same side
of the street

03:34.010 --> 03:36.444
with the building in between.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.918
And that one was
across the street.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.679
This isn't a gas leak.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.517
We got a bomber.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.619
MURRAY:
Oh, my God.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.269
Lieutenant Morse,
we need access to this location.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.878
What you need to do is not die.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.548
When my guys give the all clear,
then it's yours.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.046
With all due respect,
your guys are walking

04:19.090 --> 04:20.717
all over stuff
that mIght be Important.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.751
More than likely, you'll be
walking on our evidence.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.348
You know, we actually train

04:24.390 --> 04:25.425
the bomb squad in this city.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.927
Watch your back.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.428
You were saying.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.869
That's fire department.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.539
Look, detectives,
I've got three detonated devices

04:33.570 --> 04:35.561
and God knows how many
waiting to go off.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.500
I'm taking every precaution.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.269
All clear!

04:40.480 --> 04:41.777
That what we're waiting for.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.377
My guys tell me
it's some sort

04:45.410 --> 04:47.071
of insurance office.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.576
The bomb ignites a fire,

04:48.620 --> 04:49.939
fire causes most
of the damage.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.742
At detonation temperatures,

04:51.790 --> 04:53.951
almost everything
becomes flammable.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.023
Al?

04:58.060 --> 04:59.550
I'm guessing that's not
an advertisement

04:59.600 --> 05:00.851
for lower rates.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.367
We'll get
a translator on that.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.618
Look, obviously my guys

05:04.670 --> 05:05.967
are gonna do
a more thorough analysis,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.490
but I think it's safe to say

05:07.540 --> 05:09.508
we got a small device,
probably a pipe bomb.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.462
CARRIE:
Triggered remotely using

05:11.510 --> 05:14.536
a cell phone or a walkie set
to a specific frequency.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.970
MORSE: Exactly.
Which is why no one's using
cell phones or walkies,

05:18.010 --> 05:20.114
as per the NYPD Patrol Guide.

05:20.150 --> 05:21.674
Yeah, all right, fine.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.382
I'll leave you two experts
to your business.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.513
The NYPD Patrol Guide?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.551
Yeah.
Nice.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.618
because we're on the ground,

05:34.660 --> 05:36.423
but now I got to
loop in the Feds,

05:36.470 --> 05:37.562
and to stay in the
lead, it'd be nice

05:37.600 --> 05:38.692
to have something
to show them.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.061
Okay, Jackson Heights.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.863
Population about 108,000.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.902
Mostly middle-class Latino
and a significant

05:43.940 --> 05:45.567
South Asian population.

05:45.610 --> 05:46.838
Now, so far,
we've got nothing obvious

05:46.880 --> 05:48.575
linking the three
target locations.

05:48.610 --> 05:50.043
One's an insurance agency,

05:50.080 --> 05:51.445
another's a community center.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.674
Last one's a barbershop.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.017
All businesses were closed,
so aside

05:54.050 --> 05:55.517
from a few people
getting cut from debris,

05:55.550 --> 05:57.745
no serious injuries
or fatalities.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.758
Well, most businesses
in the neighborhood

05:59.790 --> 06:01.451
were closed
for the Muslim holiday.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.583
We got luclq.
What about the bombs?

06:03.630 --> 06:05.689
JAY: Bomb squad forensic guys
are still working through it,

06:05.730 --> 06:07.152
but it's looking
like small IEDs.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.599
No sign of times detonators.

06:08.630 --> 06:10.666
Sure,
put the commissioner through.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.588
All right, keep me informed.
Hey, Commissioner...

06:12.640 --> 06:14.961
Hey. We get anything
on that phrase on the wall?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.059
Ran it through
a quick translation program,

06:17.110 --> 06:19.135
and it says something like,

06:19.170 --> 06:20.774
"Whoever strays,

06:20.810 --> 06:22.471
we'll make them eat fire."

06:22.510 --> 06:24.148
The thing is,
and this is the scary part,

06:24.180 --> 06:25.602
you see that sword there?

06:25.650 --> 06:27.675
That same symbol showed up

06:27.720 --> 06:30.439
near all_ the locations a_
few days prIor to the bombings.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.082
MURRAY: Some kind of warning?
Could be.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.486
I've been combing
through surveillance footage,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.681
looking for the guy who made the
marks, but I got nothing yet.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.788
I don't have anything useful.
Shadow here,

06:37.830 --> 06:38.922
blur there, still working on it.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.995
Jay, stop.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.793
That woman.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.025
Right there.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.566
All clear!

06:46.600 --> 06:48.659
That's what we're waiting for.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.704
That woman's on the bomb squad.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.469
She was at the first location.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.647
Is she in any other photos?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.045
Uh...

07:00.120 --> 07:02.076
There she is again.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.486
AL: Why the hell's
a bomb squad officer

07:04.520 --> 07:05.817
casing locations
that haven't been hit yet?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.651
Got a match.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.099
Name's Aisha Conway.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.495
She's a veteran.

07:18.530 --> 07:19.929
Served in the first Gulf War.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.096
Went back in 2007

07:21.140 --> 07:22.664
with the Army 717th

07:22.710 --> 07:24.109
Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Company

07:24.140 --> 07:25.107
based out of Baghdad.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.209
Two tours,

07:26.240 --> 07:27.798
got an honorable discharge

07:27.840 --> 07:29.603
when she received
cranial Injuries.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.941
directly hit by an IED.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.117
Two soldiers riding with her

07:35.150 --> 07:36.617
were killed.

07:36.650 --> 07:38.140
You got anything
on the incident?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.657
Look familiar?

07:53.670 --> 07:54.989
CARRIE:
Hi.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.838
Hi.
Carrie Walls, NYPD Major Crimes.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.735
Is Aisha here?
Uh, yeah, she is,

07:59.780 --> 08:01.532
but she's busy at the moment.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.673
Oh, uh, can I come in, Megan?

08:03.710 --> 08:05.644
It is Megan, isn't it?
Megan Doyle?

08:05.680 --> 08:09.138
Uh, yeah, but you mind
telling me what this is about?

08:09.180 --> 08:11.785
You know, I-I really need
to speak to Aisha.

08:11.820 --> 08:12.889
Okay, well,
she's in the back working.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.080
I'll get her.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.087
Is it okay if...
No.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.781
Just hold on.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.922
Who is it, Megan?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.825
Carrie Wells.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.794
NYPD.

08:21.830 --> 08:24.094
Can we talk?

08:24.130 --> 08:25.529
Sure.

08:25.570 --> 08:26.935
What do you want to talk about?

08:26.970 --> 08:28.232
The bombings.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.238
I saw you
at the insurance office.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.238
Yeah.

08:32.270 --> 08:33.908
Place was shredded.

08:33.940 --> 08:37.774
PVC pipe, Double Extra,
about yea big.

08:37.810 --> 08:38.947
I'm guessing maybe

08:38.980 --> 08:40.709
three or four tubes.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.274
More bang for your buck.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.778
Wow, that is impressive,
putting it together so fast.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.014
Not really.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.278
I've been around.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.790
And like I say, I'm just
guessing at this point.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.751
Are you?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.792
Look, what are you doing here?

08:56.830 --> 08:58.593
I'm sure Lieutenant Morse

08:58.630 --> 09:00.268
has already filled you in
on what we know.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.858
Yeah, most of it.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.868
The thing is he hasn't
really explained to us

09:03.910 --> 09:05.639
what you were doing
at the bomb sites

09:05.670 --> 09:07.035
days before the bombings.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.818
I was...

09:13.850 --> 09:17.149
doing exactly
what you're doing now.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.839
Trying to identify

09:18.890 --> 09:21.108
our bomber.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.718
I...

09:22.760 --> 09:24.182
saw something

09:24.230 --> 09:27.222
I thought I recognized,

09:27.260 --> 09:28.727
and it scared me.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.866
The black sword.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.994
Symbol of the group that
attacked you in Iraq, right?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.736
Now that's impressive.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.874
Eh.
Look, you want to talk

09:39.910 --> 09:41.832
about today's bombings,
I'd love to.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.747
First I want _
to show you something.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.772
This is what
I've been working on.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.744
Whoa.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.252
What do you do in here?

09:55.290 --> 09:57.758
I build bombs.

09:57.790 --> 10:00.190
And then I take them apart.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.267
Not real bombs, of course,

10:03.300 --> 10:04.892
but almost.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.058
The mechanisms,
timers, detonators,

10:08.100 --> 10:09.761
every ingredient

10:09.810 --> 10:10.936
the bomber chooses

10:10.970 --> 10:12.107
is a little insight.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.836
A little psych profile.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.871
Kind of pipe they use,

10:16.910 --> 10:18.878
the way they wrap the wire,

10:18.910 --> 10:20.070
is the device

10:20.120 --> 10:21.644
command-detonated,

10:21.680 --> 10:23.113
victim-activated,

10:23.150 --> 10:25.812
a timed device

10:25.850 --> 10:27.112
or a collapsing circuit?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.855
All of these things

10:28.890 --> 10:31.427
are the fingerprints
of your bomber.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.950
What about today's bomber?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.752
You got their fingerprints?

10:34.800 --> 10:38.964
I thought I did when I first saw
the warnings go up.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.037
The black sword is the symbol
of Saif al-Saliheen,

10:42.070 --> 10:43.958
"The Sword of the Righteous."

10:44.010 --> 10:45.307
They mark the neighborhoods

10:45.340 --> 10:46.876
they're about to strike

10:46.910 --> 10:48.138
to warn their friends

10:48.180 --> 10:50.648
and spread fear
among everyone else.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.812
Here. This was taken

10:53.850 --> 10:55.442
in Baqubah in 2008.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.811
The slogan's

10:56.850 --> 10:58.112
their signature.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.289
It's how they take credit

11:00.320 --> 11:01.719
after the bombings.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.352
You think they're responsible?

11:03.390 --> 11:05.324
Like I said, I did.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.227
Until I saw the slogan
that was written on the wall

11:08.260 --> 11:10.228
at the insurance office.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.059
Al...

11:14.100 --> 11:15.328
_AL:
I'm guessmg that's not

11:15.370 --> 11:16.906
an advertisement
for lower rates.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.732
Right.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.975
Right, because they're
not the same, are they?

11:23.010 --> 11:25.877
There's a dot right here.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.741
And the slogan on the wall
at the insurance office

11:27.780 --> 11:29.179
didn't have one.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.915
The one
in Iraq

11:30.950 --> 11:33.180
translates to,
"Whosoever strays,

11:33.220 --> 11:34.414
we shall make him taste fire."

11:34.460 --> 11:36.781
When there's no dot,
this totally

11:36.830 --> 11:38.354
changes the meaning of the word.

11:38.390 --> 11:40.790
This says, "Whoever clinks,

11:40.830 --> 11:42.764
we shall make him
taste fire."

11:42.800 --> 11:44.222
No one who actually knows Arabic

11:44.270 --> 11:45.897
would ever make that mistake.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.728
You think someone's
trying to make it look like

11:48.770 --> 11:49.930
"Sword of the Righteous."

11:49.970 --> 11:53.201
At each site,
there are small errors.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.504
Look, this one is
from the barbershop.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.939
You see that mark?

11:56.980 --> 11:58.902
This makes
the word plural

11:58.950 --> 11:59.974
when it should
be singular.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.442
I don't think this guy

12:01.480 --> 12:03.118
can read what he's writing.

12:03.150 --> 12:06.517
Why haven't you told
Lieutenant Morse about this?

12:06.550 --> 12:09.314
Some grammar mistakes in Arabic?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.783
Nobody's gonna
accept that.

12:11.830 --> 12:14.025
I need to examine
what's left of the bombs.

12:14.060 --> 12:17.427
Saif al-Saliheen
had a recipe.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.495
If it's them,
I'll be able to tell.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.960
I think it's safe to
say we're looking at

12:23.010 --> 12:25.035
a small device.
Maybe a pipe bomb.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.128
CARRIE:
This mouse pad...

12:28.180 --> 12:30.000
I saw one exactly like it

12:30.050 --> 12:31.347
in the insurance office.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.848
Really

12:33.880 --> 12:35.142
Yeah, 100%.

12:35.180 --> 12:38.047
I... have a very unusual memory.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.308
I-I don't forget things.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.224
I seem been having
the same problem myself.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.022
Will you keep us looped in?

12:48.060 --> 12:49.891
You, I will.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.996
You know...

12:55.040 --> 12:56.962
part of me
doesn't want those memories

12:57.010 --> 12:58.534
of what happened over there
to ever go away.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.231
They're
terrible,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.236
but sometimes I think

13:02.280 --> 13:04.145
they're what keeps me going.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.569
Yeah, I...

13:06.610 --> 13:08.475
I kind of know what you mean.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.018
Thanks.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.456
Yeah, across the street.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.151
Uh, City Hall Restaurant.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.556
Same building.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.397
Delivery guys
never get it right.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.967
Just one sec.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.297
Yeah, that's the one.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.594
All right.
Thanks.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.107
May I help you?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.108
We're looking for
the owner, Bilal Ali?

13:32.140 --> 13:33.471
That's me.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.034
AL:
Mr. Ali, we'd like
to talk to you.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.548
Yeah.
We give those mouse pads away

13:37.580 --> 13:38.569
to our friends
and best customers.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.419
It's a way to
say thank you.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.145
How many would you say
you've given away?

13:42.180 --> 13:43.841
Maybe 20.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.289
What does this have to do
with the bombings?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.880
We found one of these
at each of the bomb sites.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.285
What are you saying?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.129
That more of my friends
could be targets?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.855
Who would have access
to your busmess records,

13:52.900 --> 13:54.856
besides yourself?
Other employees?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.322
Everyone who works here
knows everything.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.588
It is no_secret
who my friends are.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.393
We're family.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.295
I stay in business
because people are loyal.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.001
You don't need business records
to know that.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.634
Your store is the only link
to the bombings right now.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.035
It would be
really helpful

14:07.080 --> 14:08.570
if we could see those records.

14:08.610 --> 14:11.078
Bilal?

14:11.110 --> 14:12.543
REPORTER:
This video which was just
released to the media

14:12.580 --> 14:14.172
purports to show a member

14:14.220 --> 14:17.189
of the militant Muslim
fundamentalist group

14:17.220 --> 14:19.085
known as the
"Sword of the Righteous,"

14:19.120 --> 14:21.179
who are claiming responsibility

14:21.220 --> 14:22.926
for the bombings
in Jackson Heights.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.154
Yesterday 'we began.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.384
Today we continue.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.250
You insolent merchants,

14:27.300 --> 14:29.962
you shopkeepers
who parade your filth

14:30.000 --> 14:31.888
under the open slq,

14:31.930 --> 14:33.329
tomorrow we will rain
a cleansmg fire

14:33.370 --> 14:35.031
upon your homes.

14:35.070 --> 14:37.231
We will not stop
until the fallen

14:37.270 --> 14:38.567
are swept away.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.032
We will not stop

14:40.080 --> 14:41.877
until your streets are clean.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.247
*

15:07.670 --> 15:09.934
Excuse me, what assurances
can you can give the people

15:09.970 --> 15:11.437
of Jackson Heights
about their safety?

15:11.470 --> 15:13.631
As of this moment,
a joint task force,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.399
including Major Crimes,
Homeland Security, the FBI

15:16.440 --> 15:19.307
and the NYPD Bomb Squad
is working 24 hours a day

15:19.350 --> 15:20.977
to protect the citizens
of Jackson Heights

15:21.020 --> 15:22.271
and all of New York City.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.140
We will find the person
or persons responsible

15:24.190 --> 15:26.181
and bring them to justice.
What do we know about

15:26.220 --> 15:27.619
this Sword of the Righteous,
the group claiming credit

15:27.660 --> 15:30.026
for the video? Is this
a

15:30.060 --> 15:31.322
As of this moment,
we cannot confirm

15:31.360 --> 15:32.998
that Sword of the Righteous
is involved.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.021
Are they just
going after Muslims?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.199
Today's targets were all

15:37.230 --> 15:39.198
Muslim-owned businesses,

15:39.230 --> 15:41.494
but, simply put, we do not have

15:41.540 --> 15:44.668
enough information to draw
any conclusions at this time.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.302
As we learn more,

15:46.340 --> 15:47.671
we will, of course,
share that with you.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.371
Let me just say right now

15:49.410 --> 15:52.004
that what we need is _for
every Citizen of this City

15:52.050 --> 15:53.312
to look out_for
every other Citizen.

15:53.350 --> 15:55.011
You see something suspicious,

15:55.050 --> 15:56.210
you report it.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.218
And together, we will
get through this

15:58.250 --> 16:00.252
just as we always have.
Thanks.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.292
We doing autopsies
in here now?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.434
Oh, goodness, no.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.768
We're building a fort.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.109
Oh.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.335
Wow, that's great, Maya.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.631
We needed one of those.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.001
Eliot said it was okay.
She was a little scared,

16:25.050 --> 16:26.369
she didn't want me to go
to work this morning.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.571
So Joanne's keeping
an eye on her.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.248
Aunt Jo's gonna let me
dissect a heart later.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.178
Oh, well.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.256
Any volunteers?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.552
I suggested using Eliot's,

16:36.590 --> 16:39.388
but we'd have to
find it first, so...

16:40.760 --> 16:42.728
All right, baby,
I'll see you.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.093
What am I supposed
to do with this?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.767
Okay, I was trying
to hide it from Maya.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.267
Jo got her some kids' makeup,

16:51.310 --> 16:52.459
and I don't want
to encourage that,

16:52.510 --> 16:54.569
You know, little girls...
Not a problem.
Not a problem.

16:54.610 --> 16:55.133
What do we got?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.078
Okay. Homeland sent over

16:56.110 --> 16:58.340
what they have
on the Sword of the Righteous.

16:58.380 --> 17:01.269
The group primarily targets
fellow Muslims.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.049
Ones that they think have

17:03.090 --> 17:04.216
fallen from
the true faith.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.717
Operations have mostly been

17:05.750 --> 17:07.217
limited to the Middle East,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.488
but last year they were

17:08.520 --> 17:09.509
suspected of
being part

17:09.560 --> 17:11.289
of the plot
to hit a number

17:11.330 --> 17:13.355
of moderate mosques
in Paris.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.356
Which is consistent
with the three targets here.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.822
They're all businesses owned
by moderate Muslim families.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.521
That's why they picked them.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.162
What about these wall slogans?

17:20.200 --> 17:22.088
Also consistent
with other al-Qaeda

17:22.140 --> 17:24.335
factions. Make sure
people know who did it.

17:24.370 --> 17:27.077
_ Carrie thinks there are
incon5istenCIes in the slogans

17:27.110 --> 17:29.328
used in today's bombings.
Could be a misdirect.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.348
I don't know, Al. I mean,
if it walks like a duck,

17:31.380 --> 17:32.540
quacks like a duck...

17:32.580 --> 17:34.116
Yeah, well, according to Carrie,

17:34.150 --> 17:35.219
it doesn't spell like a duck.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.808
Look, the press is all over me

17:36.850 --> 17:38.408
on this
Sword of the Righteous group.

17:38.450 --> 17:41.112
So until we have more,
they're our best lead.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.752
And while you're
at it, can someone

17:42.790 --> 17:44.382
explain to me how whoever it is

17:44.430 --> 17:46.079
is moving around
that neighborhood

17:46.130 --> 17:47.392
planting bombs without

17:47.430 --> 17:49.523
being seen?

17:49.560 --> 17:50.822
MAN:
All the doors were

17:50.870 --> 17:52.826
locked. I'm sure of it.
I have the only set

17:52.870 --> 17:55.361
of keys and I never
forget them.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.867
Anything strange
happen lately?

17:56.900 --> 17:58.231
Any threats?

17:58.270 --> 17:59.464
No.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.137
Look”.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.307
I run a continuing
education center.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.342
I have cooking Classes.
I'm not political. These people,

18:06.380 --> 18:09.770
they're crazy. They claim to
be so religious, so devout.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.287
They say they're
all about God,

18:11.320 --> 18:12.844
but they're egotists.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.619
They give Islam a bad name.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.786
At this point,
Mr. Khan,

18:15.820 --> 18:17.481
we don't know
who's responSIble.

18:18.830 --> 18:21.355
...as per the NYPD
Patrol Guide.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.699
MORSE:
All right, fine. I'll leave you
two experts to your business.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.290
Al.
Yeah?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.433
There's glass embedded
low on the wall here,

18:29.470 --> 18:31.665
just like at the
insurance office.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.304
From the force of the blast.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.534
No.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.275
No, there shouldn't
be glass here.

18:37.310 --> 18:39.301
It would have to be lying here
before the blast

18:39.350 --> 18:41.341
in order to be embedded
into the wall.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.484
He broke the window to get in.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.284
That's why the glass
was here before.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.709
You think he could have
climbed down from the roof?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.853
Fire escape doesn't go
all the way up to the roof.

18:51.890 --> 18:54.199
He had to come in
from the alley.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.619
But the alley's gated,
and according to Jay,

18:56.660 --> 18:58.264
there's no one
on the Video surveillance

18:58.300 --> 19:00.120
going in or going out.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.628
All the trash gets taken
out to the curb.

19:04.670 --> 19:07.639
Nobody ever comes back here
anymore.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.444
Y'all are luclq I was even
able to find the key.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.441
These marks look fresh.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.922
Al.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.228
Sewer?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.669
CARRIE
Oh, I hope not.

19:36.970 --> 19:39.200
Ladies first.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.901
You're always such a gentleman.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.908
Ugh.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.842
It's a subway service tunnel.
Jay's sending me a map.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.438
It's used to move equipment,
evacuate passengers,

19:48.480 --> 19:49.947
that kind of thing.

19:49.980 --> 19:50.981
Who has access down here?

19:51.020 --> 19:53.318
Anyone who works for the MTA,

19:53.360 --> 19:55.783
Con Ed guys,
maintenance personnel.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.253
Rats.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.951
Oh, very funny.
What? Do you know

19:58.990 --> 20:01.891
that there are 8.5 million rats
in the subway system alone?

20:01.930 --> 20:03.966
You're not getting to me.
I don't have a thing about rats.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.820
You don't have a thing
about rats
Mm-mm.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.997
Because I remember
a very interesting inCident

20:08.040 --> 20:10.702
with some church ladies,
you and a garbage bag.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.958
That was a decade ago, okay?

20:13.010 --> 20:14.978
Okay, I did, at one point,
harbor an irrational

20:15.010 --> 20:16.329
fear of
rodents.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.904
But people change,
all right?

20:17.950 --> 20:20.669
They face their fears, and
in facing them, overcome them.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.312
Rat!

20:23.690 --> 20:25.783
Oh. I'm sorry.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.378
Not fair.
Sorry.

20:35.530 --> 20:38.328
Hey.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.860
Somehow I'm guessing
you're gonna tell me

20:39.900 --> 20:41.891
you didn't know
this was here, huh?

20:41.940 --> 20:43.908
This has got to be a mistake.

20:43.940 --> 20:46.261
Look, someone from this store
was using that ladder

20:46.310 --> 20:47.937
to access those tunnels.
That's how the bomber was able

20:47.980 --> 20:49.572
to move around
without being noticed.

20:49.610 --> 20:50.804
I never left
the store yesterday.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.499
You can check the cameras.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.040
All right, what about
your employees?
What are you

20:54.080 --> 20:56.469
talking about?
That's impossible.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.010
I know them all.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.628
One of the guys isn't here.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.626
Uh, tall...

21:12.670 --> 21:14.467
mid-305, green eyes.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.967
Samir?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.467
He didn't come in today.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.001
I called his house, no answer.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.338
Does he have access
to this store after

21:22.380 --> 21:24.348
Yeah. I gave him a key

21:24.380 --> 21:26.439
to come in and do the inventory.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.845
I'm gonna need a photo of him.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.438
I'm gonna need
all his information--

21:29.480 --> 21:31.789
employment application,
everything you've got.

21:31.820 --> 21:32.980
I need it....
Of course.
Carrie?

21:33.020 --> 21:34.578
There might be another bomb
two blocks away.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.315
We need to evacuate.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.054
We got to go.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.366
Robot couldn't get a
look inside the bag.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.789
I want a visual only.
In and out.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.468
Just find out
what we got going on here.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.491
You ready? Good.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.361
Be safe.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.961
*

22:42.690 --> 22:43.918
Yeah, across the street.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.552
City Hall Restaurant.

22:45.590 --> 22:47.126
Same building.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.491
Aisha!

22:48.530 --> 22:49.554
Damn.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.729
What's...? Carrie!

23:02.780 --> 23:03.439
Hey, hey! I'm right here.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.777
He's getting more sophisticated.

23:04.810 --> 23:06.004
He wants people to die.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.171
Hey.
Carrie?

23:09.220 --> 23:11.518
Samir Bensaidi isn't
who he says he is.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.780
He's actually Jean-Luc Augustin.
Born in Paris.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.913
Fell in with
the wrong crowd early on.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.726
And then became an explosive
expert for various outfits.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.593
Now, he deals mostly
in high-end theft--

23:22.630 --> 23:24.689
art museums, casinos,
private collections.

23:24.730 --> 23:27.938
An-any connections to terrorism,
Al

23:27.970 --> 23:29.961
Well, nothing that I can find,
but it doesn't mean that he

23:30.000 --> 23:31.865
couldn't have been radicalized
somewhere along the way.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.708
So, what is he--
a terrorist or a thief?

23:34.740 --> 23:35.832
Mr. Ali hired him
six months ago.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.541
Said he was
the perfect employee.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.707
All right, do you
have ai?\l address?
0.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.911
Got a dead end on that one.
It's a PO box.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.884
But some of the employees
we spoke to said he used

23:43.920 --> 23:45.911
public transportation,
so we're Checking camera footage

23:45.950 --> 23:47.918
from the nearest subway,
bus stops.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.884
Maybe we can figure out
which way he was headed.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.784
Check hardware stores,
building supplies.

23:52.830 --> 23:56.049
Anything that you can think of
where he might be getting PVC.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.523
He's got to be getting
his supply somewhere.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.538
You got it.

24:00.570 --> 24:03.539
Augustin is our guy, but I
don't think he's a terrorist.

24:03.570 --> 24:05.106
He's setting off
bombs, Carrie.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.960
Okay, but Aisha's right.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.807
The whole Muslim fanatic
profile doesn't fit.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.671
I think he's hiding
behind that.

24:10.710 --> 24:11.972
Been a while since I've
played hide-and-seek,

24:12.010 --> 24:13.511
but the idea, ifI remember,

24:13.550 --> 24:15.541
is not to be found.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.172
Augustin's guaranteed that
half the law enforcement

24:17.220 --> 24:19.609
_on the east coast
is looking for him.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.878
Well, maybe that's the point.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.854
"All war is based on deception."

24:22.890 --> 24:24.187
Who said that?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.721
Well, I did just now.
Yeah, but who made it up?

24:26.760 --> 24:28.557
What You think I'm not
capable of making that up?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.897
Come on.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.966
Sun Tzu.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.126
Who's that?

24:33.170 --> 24:35.832
Su Art

24:35.870 --> 24:36.894
Sorry.
Oh, no.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.134
That's okay. It's just...

24:38.170 --> 24:41.037
well, the-the idea is
that he wants us to think

24:41.080 --> 24:43.036
he's a terrorist
to hide his true motive.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.173
Let's say Augustin's
really just a thief.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.849
And maybe he couldn't
get to his real target

24:47.880 --> 24:50.986
without the panic and diversion
of a fake terrorist attack.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.942
See? I like that.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.855
"When the enemy is relaxed,
make them toil.

24:54.890 --> 24:57.723
"And when full, starve them.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.751
When settled, make them move."
Sun Tzu.

24:59.790 --> 25:00.950
I thought you said...

25:01.000 --> 25:02.820
Yeah, "deception"

25:04.130 --> 25:05.927
So Augustin's trying
to create a panic

25:05.970 --> 25:07.858
to divert attention away
from his real plan,

25:07.900 --> 25:09.891
which is probably
some kind of heist.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.635
But what

25:11.670 --> 25:13.103
And how much more of a diversion
Will he need?

25:13.140 --> 25:15.836
He's shown he's willing
to kill people now.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.972
JAY:
Guys,

25:17.010 --> 25:18.773
I got it
on my second try.

25:18.810 --> 25:21.608
The PVC pipe our bomber used
was pretty specific stuff,

25:21.650 --> 25:23.686
Schedule 80. It's got

25:23.720 --> 25:26.041
extra thick walls,
one and three-eighths inches
in diameter.

25:26.090 --> 25:27.853
I found this place,
Carter's Hardware

25:27.890 --> 25:29.881
on Duane Street and Church,
that stocks this stuff.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.285
Owner ID'd Augustin.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.286
Said he bought a case
of it, precut.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.298
How long ago did he pick it up?
A week ago.

25:35.330 --> 25:36.957
Owner asked him
if he wanted it delivered.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.922
Augustin said no.
He don't trust delivery guys.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.961
He'd carry it out himself.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.268
Yeah, across the street.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.699
City Hall Restaurant.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.002
Same building.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.064
Delivery guys
never get it right.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.338
Just one second.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.972
He was on the phone
when we met him

25:50.010 --> 25:51.648
ordering something.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.944
I think he may have been
ordering for himself.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.538
And I've got an address.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.187
AL:
We're ready to go in.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.051
ELIOT: _
I want you to wait
until the Bomb Squad

26:01.090 --> 26:03.251
gets there.
They're wrapping up a sweep

26:03.290 --> 26:06.088
on, uh, Roosevelt Avenue.
They can be there in an hour.

26:06.130 --> 26:07.358
There's no time.

26:07.390 --> 26:09.051
No, he could've easily rigged

26:09.100 --> 26:10.897
the apartment.
Let me get you some backup.

26:10.930 --> 26:12.192
Listen,
we'll be extra careful.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.891
I promise.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.589
Carrie. Carrie, d...

26:17.970 --> 26:20.359
Have you seen Murray's daughter?
Conference room.

26:20.410 --> 26:22.970
I looked in _there...
I promise.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.221
Hey, you.

26:38.260 --> 26:41.093
I saw on TV
there was another bomb.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.025
Yeah, there was.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.062
I'm scared
about my mom.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.658
I know.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.965
Hey, is there room for two
under there?

26:58.310 --> 27:00.301
Oh, Maya.

27:00.350 --> 27:04.684
I love what you've
done with this place.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.314
Magenta is just so au courant,
you know?

27:07.350 --> 27:11.150
You see so many forts these days
in browns or...

27:11.190 --> 27:14.227
clay red, which is so redundant,
you know?

27:14.260 --> 27:16.990
It's pink.

27:17.030 --> 27:20.193
Pink. Magenta. Fuchsia.

27:22.370 --> 27:25.066
Why can't those off-reds
just get along?

27:25.110 --> 27:28.079
Thanks for checking on me, Jo.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.668
I'll be fine.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.905
I know.

27:31.950 --> 27:35.078
You want to know what I do
when I get scared?

27:35.120 --> 27:36.712
Does it involve...

27:36.750 --> 27:38.342
dead people?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.183
Maybe.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.251
Could you tell me next time?

27:45.290 --> 27:48.293
I certainly can.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.994
Your mom's gonna be fine.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.202
I promise.

28:02.110 --> 28:04.874
Wait. Wait.

28:08.050 --> 28:11.019
Just give me a second.
What are you gonna do?

28:11.050 --> 28:15.384
Oh, I don't really need to
powder my nose, but thank you.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.861
Whoa.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.198
We're waiting
for the Bomb Squad.

28:26.230 --> 28:29.233
No. You got any more powder?
Throw it again.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.748
I got this.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.749
If you make a
mistake, we're dead.
No, no.

28:40.780 --> 28:43.146
I won't make a mistake.

28:52.930 --> 28:55.194
Here I go.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.268
Oh! Ah.

29:10.140 --> 29:13.473
I got this.

29:17.450 --> 29:18.986
You got any more powder?

29:19.020 --> 29:20.282
It's all gone.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.311
Oh. Well, then this is
as far as I can go.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.486
What do you see?

29:23.520 --> 29:24.487
Uh...

29:24.530 --> 29:27.181
well, I see

29:27.230 --> 29:30.290
a bunch of photos, most of them

29:30.330 --> 29:32.127
from the Jackson Heights target

29:32.170 --> 29:34.297
and then a bunch that I don't...
I don't recognize.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.296
Anything else?

29:36.340 --> 29:39.002
Yeah. A...

29:39.040 --> 29:40.166
rental agreement for...

29:40.210 --> 29:41.279
a QuikAuto.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.177
It's for a van.

29:44.210 --> 29:45.848
Car bomb.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.269
Yeah.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.140
All right, I'm coming back.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.181
Be careful.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.187
Don't worry, Al.

29:52.220 --> 29:55.189
I won't blow us up.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.881
JAY:
QuikAuto hooked me up
to the GPS data

29:56.920 --> 29:58.319
from Augustin's
rental car.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.328
Now, there's no signal,
so he could be

30:00.360 --> 30:02.294
in a tunnel, parking garage--
it's hard to tell.

30:02.330 --> 30:04.525
Did they give you access
to his GPS history?

30:04.570 --> 30:05.969
They sure did.

30:06.000 --> 30:06.989
Where's he been
this past week?

30:07.030 --> 30:08.292
Not many places

30:08.340 --> 30:09.295
but it looks like
there are a lot of trips,

30:09.340 --> 30:10.295
maybe about eight of them,

30:10.340 --> 30:11.830
to one particular spot.

30:11.870 --> 30:14.600
On 111th and 47th Ave.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.198
Hall of Science.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.332
What's on exhibit?

30:19.250 --> 30:21.047
You're gonna love this.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.173
"A World of Precious Gems."

30:23.220 --> 30:26.041
He's not blowing that up.
I think we just found
his target.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.927
Let's lock it down. Give
me a perimeter right here.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.392
Did you clear
the building?

30:40.430 --> 30:42.261
We didn't have to.
We've been closing early.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.905
With all
these bombs, uh,

30:44.940 --> 30:47.238
most of the guards are
helping out elsewhere.
Okay.

30:47.270 --> 30:49.204
Have you seen
anything suspicious
in the last couple hours?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.049
No, it's been quiet.
There's nothing.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.002
Yeah, Murray.
It's like I told your colleague

30:53.050 --> 30:54.244
on the phone,

30:54.280 --> 30:55.474
we're not being robbed.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.147
Got it. We're on our way.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.488
Murray found
his rental car.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.318
Parked outside of a school
a half-mile away.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.316
There's a bomb in it.
What about the kids?

31:03.360 --> 31:04.486
All still inside.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.350
Guys, we're out of here!

31:06.390 --> 31:08.290
Come on. We got to go.
No.

31:08.330 --> 31:09.957
MAN: We're moving out!
What?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.592
He has been coming here
over and over.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.962
There's a reaso_n._ _
We're just... We're missmg it.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.331
We can come back to this.

31:15.370 --> 31:16.462
Go. I'll be all right.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.972
What do you see?
Well, I see

31:27.010 --> 31:28.318
some photos,

31:28.350 --> 31:30.648
some of them from
the Jackson Heights targets.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.580
That view.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.656
Augustin had pictures
of this exact view

31:34.690 --> 31:38.421
in his apartment right here.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.348
Al, he's not targeting
the museum.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.494
He's targeting
those buildings right there.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.294
He was scoping
his approaches and getaways.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.062
It's an industrial park

31:50.100 --> 31:52.500
built in '97 at the end
of the tech boom.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.405
Warehouses, manufacturing.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.372
Jay couldn't get
me specific clients.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.139
Lot of government types,

31:57.180 --> 31:59.273
looks like.
The guard shack is empty.

31:59.310 --> 32:00.709
That's not
a good Sign.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.570
I called for backup, but
we're sealed off out here

32:02.620 --> 32:04.440
'cause of the car bomb--
no one in or out.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.378
Oh, we can handle it.

32:06.420 --> 32:09.253
Yeah, every time you say
that, I end up with stitches.

32:09.290 --> 32:11.588
You know, guys with scars
are very, very sew.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.155
If you're right, there's
something valuable enough

32:14.200 --> 32:16.623
in here for Augustin
to go through all this trouble.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.461
Let's find out
what it is.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.505
What's a bomb squad
truck doing here?

32:37.350 --> 32:39.341
We need access
to this location.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.119
What you need to do is not die.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.617
When my guys give the all-clear,
then it's yours.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.658
Something's not right, Al.

32:45.690 --> 32:48.158
Should have a precinct number
on it, right?

32:52.630 --> 32:54.188
AL:
That's Augustin.

32:56.170 --> 32:58.161
Move the truck.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.575
Jay, I don't care about redacted
names and government protocols.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.383
I need to know
what happens

33:11.420 --> 33:12.785
in this building--
building number eight.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.550
Hold on.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.717
Okay, guys,

33:17.760 --> 33:19.557
looks like the entire building
isleased

33:19.590 --> 33:21.148
by Allied Superconductor.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.259
Now, they are major suppliers
of tech

33:23.300 --> 33:26.269
to the Defense Department--
circuit boards,

33:26.300 --> 33:28.291
missile guidance systems,
but that's just the half of it.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.160
All right, they've been
in the news recently

33:30.200 --> 33:32.259
for fighting off hackers
from China and North Korea.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.232
So our guy's taking
the direct route.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.679
On-the-ground theft.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.575
Guys, this is a huge score.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.305
Allied makes
cutting-edge stuff--

33:39.350 --> 33:41.648
toys you and I have never
heard of and maybe never will.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.614
And depending on what
they're cooking up over there,

33:43.650 --> 33:45.618
it could be worth billions
on the black market.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.743
A little more than
some rhinestone tiaras.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.678
Hold on. There's something else
you should know.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.153
The building
you're about to enter

33:51.190 --> 33:52.726
has Level Four safety status.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.489
Which means?

33:54.530 --> 33:56.748
Which means, the whole place
is filled with aluminum dust

33:56.800 --> 33:58.529
from the microscopic polishing
that they do.

33:58.570 --> 33:59.719
Okay? Any spark--

33:59.770 --> 34:01.397
static electricity,

34:01.440 --> 34:03.567
let alone the muzzle flash
from a gun,

34:03.600 --> 34:05.739
and you will be blown slq high.

34:05.770 --> 34:06.737
Right.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.470
MAN:
Come on, let's go.
Move it.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.740
Load these up quickly.
One more pass, then we're done.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.715
Sit.

34:18.750 --> 34:22.186
We got to get
those people out.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.687
I'll take them,
you follow the others?

34:23.720 --> 34:25.119
Oh, I'm gonna do
more than follow.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.220
No gunfire.
I remember.

34:38.770 --> 34:40.101
You three with me.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.207
Don't move.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.680
(man grunting,
electronic Chirp)

35:28.360 --> 35:31.249
Carrie, there's a bomb.

35:31.290 --> 35:33.326
Go get Augustin.
I got this. Just go.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.899
Oh.

35:51.410 --> 35:56.313
AISHA:
I build bombs,
and then I take them apart.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.691
No.

36:08.730 --> 36:13.690
AISHA:
Every ingredient the bomber
chooses is a little insight,

36:13.730 --> 36:15.334
a little psych profile.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.834
Deception, remember?

36:21.810 --> 36:22.970
That's too easy.

36:26.780 --> 36:28.372
Another timer.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.809
You think you're so Clever.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.978
All these things are
the fingerprints to your bomb.

36:34.020 --> 36:37.319
Now just do it in reverse.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.782
Just pull the timer?

36:38.830 --> 36:42.857
Disconnect the igniter?

36:42.900 --> 36:45.892
Here goes.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.905
Oh, boy.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.775
Boom.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.842
How the hell
did you dismantle it?

37:05.890 --> 37:07.778
Because I had
a really good teacher.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.959
I watched you build that bomb
in your basement,

37:09.990 --> 37:12.959
and, um, I just, you know,
remembered it.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.548
What about the dummy timer?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.851
I never said anything
about that.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.289
Yes, you did.
"Every ingredient

37:18.330 --> 37:20.469
our bomber uses is
a little psych profile."

37:20.500 --> 37:22.388
And this guy was
all about deception.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.829
Huh.
All right.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.759
When do I get to wear the cool
green suit with the helmet?

37:27.810 --> 37:30.335
Ooh.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.599
Maybe the suit?
No way the helmet.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.641
What do you mean,
no way the helmet?
No. You know what?

37:35.680 --> 37:36.942
I can get you a little cap.
A cap.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.948
With a T-shirt
that says "bomb squad."

37:38.990 --> 37:40.617
Okay, that's
not gonna fly.
You know...

37:40.650 --> 37:42.857
I want the helmet.
I earned the helmet.

37:42.890 --> 37:45.279
The T-shirts are nice!

37:53.970 --> 37:55.665
Wow. Hi.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.962
Hi, Mom.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.536
Watch out.
Oh.

37:58.570 --> 37:59.832
You're sitting
on my operating room.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.508
Oh.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.405
You got a lot of cool stuff
down here.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.976
Thanks.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.944
_ I wanted
to bring down a scalpel,

38:06.980 --> 38:08.914
but Jo said it was too sharp.

38:10.650 --> 38:13.778
All right, boo, it
is time to go home.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.583
What do you say to that?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.723
Suppose...

38:19.760 --> 38:22.888
I don't want to.

38:22.930 --> 38:27.867
Hey. Hey, we got
the bad guy, huh?

38:27.900 --> 38:30.892
Come on. Everything's
gonna be okay, boo.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.966
You used to say that
about Daddy.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.777
But he died.

38:47.490 --> 38:49.879
Mm.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.958
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

38:56.730 --> 39:01.861
And things were
definitely not okay, hmm?

39:01.900 --> 39:05.006
Do you know what I
loved most about Daddy?

39:10.540 --> 39:12.906
That he was so brave?

39:15.950 --> 39:19.716
He was so, so brave.

39:25.690 --> 39:30.923
He... he had this
very special gift

39:30.960 --> 39:34.532
for always making the world
seem like a good place.

39:36.570 --> 39:39.539
He made people feel safe.

39:39.570 --> 39:42.130
Oh, God, he made
me feel so safe.

39:47.050 --> 39:52.579
Which is why I wanted
to come here, you know,

39:52.620 --> 39:56.010
so that I could help
everyone else in this City

39:56.060 --> 39:59.029
feel just the same way.

39:59.060 --> 40:02.848
I can't make all the
scary things go away.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.766
But look at me.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.739
I promise...

40:09.770 --> 40:12.933
I will always be here

40:12.970 --> 40:15.768
to get through it with you.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.038
When you say "here,"

40:23.080 --> 40:27.119
do you mean...
in this fort?

40:29.660 --> 40:33.118
No, Maya, you cannot build
a fort in our living room.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.991
Please.

40:35.030 --> 40:36.952
Maybe.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.060
Come on, let's go home
and talk about it, huh?

40:40.100 --> 40:42.136
Okay, let's go.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.168
Huh.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.809
Oh, you got gifts.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.556
Yeah.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.148
Murray's a good mom.

41:04.190 --> 41:07.079
Yeah, she is.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.894
Sometimes I get tired of going
home to an empty apartment.

41:09.930 --> 41:11.591
Know what I mean?

41:11.630 --> 41:13.097
I do.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.064
Maybe you should get yourself
a pussy cat.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.864
They're warm, they curl up
next to you in bed.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.575
I could. I still think the place
would feel kind of lonely.

41:21.610 --> 41:24.545
It's about...

41:24.580 --> 41:26.138
companionship.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.045
The human touch.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.241
You know,
if you want companionship,

41:30.280 --> 41:31.918
you should learn how to dance.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.145
I'm a great dancer.
You love dancing.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.055
You're not a great dancer.
They're two different things.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.115
I am a pretty good dancer,
and you know it.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.627
You want to see good dancing?

41:39.660 --> 41:41.753
I got some moves,
and I learned them today.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.756
Let's see how good you are.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.688
Don't get scared.

41:47.670 --> 41:51.800
That's a style of dancing
I'm unaware of, but, uh,

41:51.840 --> 41:53.637
let's see. Just like...

41:53.670 --> 41:56.138
Like a... thing
and then a thing.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.670
Wow.
Right?

41:57.710 --> 41:59.041
What are you laughing at?

41:59.080 --> 42:00.672
That's not what you did?

42:00.710 --> 42:02.974
You know what?

42:03.020 --> 42:06.080
Having a great memory doesn't
make you a great dancer.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.815
Maybe I just need
a better teacher.

42:07.850 --> 42:11.980
You want the human touch, Al?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.281
There's your human touch.

42:13.330 --> 42:15.298
Let's get a drink.
