<i>( door opens )</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:18.893
<i>( door closes )</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:28.236
Just gonna say
a few things
that I know

00:28.319 --> 00:31.364
and a few things I'd like
to find out about.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.991
Anyhow...

00:33.074 --> 00:36.911
I got out of a meeting
with forensics earlier today.

00:36.995 --> 00:42.041
I made a copy of the report
for you to read later.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.378
<i>Maybe it'll jog</i>
<i>your memory or something.</i>

00:48.548 --> 00:51.342
<i>The short of it?</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:53.470
Olivia,
she got hit on the jaw

00:53.553 --> 00:55.805
on the left side
of her face

00:55.889 --> 00:57.849
by someone
who was right-handed.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.727
I don't know
if you know this,

01:00.810 --> 01:03.062
but Eric Neill
is left-handed.

01:04.814 --> 01:09.027
<i>Your right hand was red,</i>
<i>bloody, and swollen.</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:12.322
<i>Both when Tia</i>
<i>picked you up at midnight--</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:15.617
<i>11:57 to be exact--</i>

01:15.700 --> 01:19.621
<i>and then in the morning</i>
<i>when Frank got you in town.</i>

01:19.704 --> 01:21.831
And also Facebook.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.291
( sighs )

01:23.374 --> 01:26.711
You deleted photos of you
showing you wearing a T-shirt

01:26.795 --> 01:30.256
that was found
buried with the body.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.383
<i>You asked Tia--</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:36.012
<i>my son's in her class,</i>
<i>by the way--</i>

01:36.095 --> 01:38.932
<i>to lie about</i>
<i>what happened that night.</i>

01:39.015 --> 01:42.101
<i>And you asked Frank</i>
<i>to do the same thing.</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:44.187
<i>Twice.</i>

01:44.270 --> 01:46.856
<i>Back then and now.</i>

01:49.067 --> 01:50.652
<i>And finally...</i>

01:50.735 --> 01:55.156
we had a guy
following you today, man.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.116
As soon as you found out
the information

01:57.200 --> 01:58.993
on what was found
with the body,

01:59.077 --> 02:01.162
you left the hotel.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.498
You went
to Marcellus County.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.501
That's where the gardener,
Horacio, lives.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.963
<i>He's the guy you sold</i>
<i>the truck to in a hurry</i>
<i>when--</i>

02:10.046 --> 02:12.841
<i>after the murder.</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:14.843
<i>After Horacio,</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:18.012
<i>you went</i>
<i>to a gas station</i>
<i>on the I-80.</i>

02:18.096 --> 02:19.556
( sighs )

02:19.639 --> 02:23.226
We've got some guys going
to the gas station now.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.229
They've been instructed
to search the dumpsters.

02:27.939 --> 02:31.150
You wanna tell me
what they're gonna find or...

02:31.234 --> 02:33.444
<i>should I wait for them</i>
<i>to tell me?</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:36.030
Joel!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.247
What happens now?

02:47.083 --> 02:51.462
Now I go back to the office
and I write up a warrant.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.256
I bring it
to the prosecutor
first thing,

02:53.339 --> 02:56.885
and when he signs it,
and I do believe he will
sign it...

02:58.428 --> 03:02.056
<i>then I go and I talk</i>
<i>to Judge Warren in chambers</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:05.560
<i>and I tell her everything</i>
<i>I just told you.</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:08.187
<i>And then</i>
<i>she approves it,</i>

03:08.271 --> 03:10.982
and then I come back
to this hotel room...

03:13.151 --> 03:17.071
and you and Laura
are gonna have to decide
how to play this.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.742
A double Don Julio plotted,
neat, lime, no salt.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.327
<i>( chatter )</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:24.537
<i>( man clears throat )</i>
<i>Um, hello? Yeah.</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

03:26.331 --> 03:28.666
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>
<i>I'm Michael O'Connor.</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:31.461
-<i> Hello, everyone.</i>
<i>How's it going?</i>
- ( chatter stops )

03:31.544 --> 03:36.132
<i>Okay, so this is the part</i>
<i>of the annual fundraiser</i>

03:36.215 --> 03:39.552
<i>where the host</i>
<i>gives an intro talk.</i>

03:39.636 --> 03:41.971
<i>And this would be</i>
<i>the part of the talk</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:45.308
<i>where I would say something</i>
<i>punchy or comical</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:46.768
<i>to break up the tension.</i>

03:46.851 --> 03:49.187
<i>So imagine</i>
<i>that this is that.</i>

03:49.270 --> 03:51.356
( laughter )

03:51.439 --> 03:53.942
<i>I grew up</i>
<i>with Olivia Lake.</i>

03:54.025 --> 03:56.611
<i>Not just like you all did</i>
<i>reading her book,</i>

03:56.694 --> 03:59.489
<i>but I-- I literally grew up</i>
<i>up the hill from her.</i>

03:59.572 --> 04:03.117
I used to ride my Big Wheel
in her parking lot,

04:03.201 --> 04:04.994
which is
right down there.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.289
She's like
a surrogate mom to me.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.292
So, what else can I say
about Olivia Lake

04:11.376 --> 04:14.629
- that she hasn't already
told me to say?
- ( laughter )

04:14.712 --> 04:16.089
Wait, shoot.
"...about Olivia Lake

04:16.172 --> 04:17.298
that she hasn't
already told me to say?"

04:17.382 --> 04:19.258
What did I write?

04:19.342 --> 04:21.010
But what--
oh, right, okay,

04:21.094 --> 04:23.513
so, but why
are we really here?

04:23.596 --> 04:27.350
( stammering )
Because this is
the time of year

04:27.433 --> 04:30.353
that we all have a chance
to make a real difference,

04:30.436 --> 04:32.689
a difference in
the lives of children

04:32.772 --> 04:34.315
not just
in the Summit area,

04:34.399 --> 04:38.486
but all throughout
the entire greater
Salt Lake area as well.

04:38.569 --> 04:43.658
So, Olivia Lake
began her career
as a graphic designer

04:43.741 --> 04:48.329
before illustrating
several children's books
for other authors

04:48.413 --> 04:51.582
when she awoke
from a dream
with the idea

04:51.666 --> 04:54.043
for "Whose Woods
These Are."

04:54.127 --> 04:56.421
- Hi.
- I thought maybe

04:56.504 --> 04:59.090
I should put both of us
out of your misery.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.009
( laughter )

05:05.221 --> 05:08.307
Oh, but first,
I'd like to pretend

05:08.391 --> 05:12.603
that I'm not old enough
to be anybody's surrogate mom.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.023
<i>However, more sincerely,</i>

05:15.106 --> 05:19.068
<i>I'd like to say</i>
<i>you're kind of like the son</i>
<i>I never knew I really wanted.</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:21.279
<i>( laughter )</i>

05:21.362 --> 05:26.117
But first, just look
at this beautiful,
beautiful house,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.702
and, um...

05:29.120 --> 05:30.955
that you have offered us
for this event.

05:31.039 --> 05:31.956
I mean, come on.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.667
And the seed money

05:34.751 --> 05:36.544
that you gave us
to start Mosaic

05:36.627 --> 05:38.796
or we wouldn't even be here
to start with.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.677
Michael is...

05:46.095 --> 05:51.392
You are one of
the most sensitive people

05:51.476 --> 05:54.270
I've ever had
the pleasure of knowing.

05:54.353 --> 05:58.608
And that
sensitivity has...

05:58.691 --> 06:02.070
( exhales )
...turned into

06:02.153 --> 06:08.159
being one of the most
acute collectors of art,

06:08.242 --> 06:11.162
which you could all see

06:11.245 --> 06:14.082
if you were lucky enough
to have a tour of
the Red Room.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.835
Hey, why don't
we auction off

06:17.919 --> 06:20.379
tours of
the Red Room today

06:20.463 --> 06:23.633
for, like, $1,000?

06:23.716 --> 06:26.094
Uh, yeah, yeah, okay.
That sounds good.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.222
- Okay, $1,000, anybody?
- All: Yes!

06:29.305 --> 06:30.640
Oh, God,
thank you.

06:30.723 --> 06:34.477
- Make it 10!
- Yay! Thank you.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.854
Because we really
do need those funds

06:36.938 --> 06:39.607
to keep Mosaic going,
and...

06:39.690 --> 06:43.194
you know,
it only takes one person
to change a life.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.238
( chattering )

06:45.321 --> 06:47.782
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

06:47.865 --> 06:51.536
Hunky bartender--
your team or mine?

06:51.619 --> 06:54.080
I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.249
Reconnaissance,
<i>s'il vous pla√Æt.</i>

06:56.332 --> 06:58.167
Yes, Captain.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.921
So, Red Room?

07:02.004 --> 07:04.841
- We're there!
- Really? Great.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.259
- Thank you...
- Thank you.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.219
...very much.
Really appreciate that.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.971
Thank you.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.722
( phone chiming )

07:14.976 --> 07:17.645
<i>( ice crunching )</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:29.907
Double Glenlivet
on the rocks with a splash.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.577
JC:
<i>Oh, actually, I just</i>
<i>wanted a single.</i>

07:32.660 --> 07:34.162
Well, I'm sorry.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.164
I've been instructed
to only pour doubles
this afternoon.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.833
Oh, who could possibly
do a thing like that?

07:40.793 --> 07:44.046
Someone who actually thinks
I'm gonna write her
another check.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.842
He could.
I finally got a pen
that writes on rubber.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.595
( chuckles )

07:50.678 --> 07:53.681
Pour me something
tall and muscular.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.892
You got it.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.353
A lesser nuanced host
might have said "stiff."

08:00.479 --> 08:02.440
Okay,
cue Bill Conti.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.692
I think I'm being
played off.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.413
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.715
I'm sorry,
I know you probably
get this a lot,

08:27.798 --> 08:29.842
- but--
- Oh, I know.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.886
I'm a little old
for a children's author.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.387
( chuckles )

08:35.806 --> 08:38.643
You might be the reason
I became an artist.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.442
...then I moved to New York
to get a publisher
and an agent,

08:46.525 --> 08:49.904
and then blew
through half my savings
in the first couple of weeks.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.241
And-- and a buddy
told me about Summit.

08:53.324 --> 08:57.119
Ah, so you thought,
"There's all these rich people
blowing in and out here..."

08:57.203 --> 08:59.914
- ( laughs ) Yeah.
- "...so I'll come out,
bank some cash."

08:59.997 --> 09:02.458
- Bank it out.
- "And I'm from
Minnesota..."

09:02.541 --> 09:06.629
- Oh, yeah.
- "...so I'll come out here
and teach skiing."

09:06.712 --> 09:10.007
A little skiing,
a little hunting,
some tennis.

09:10.091 --> 09:14.345
Oh, and then you
blew out your knee?

09:14.428 --> 09:16.472
- Shoulder.
- Oh.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.432
- Rotator cuff,
actually.
- Oh.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.142
In a car wreck,
of all things.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.145
Oh, I bet that tree
just jumped right out
in the middle of the road.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.899
Oh, you know, I think
it was a little more of
an insurance scam.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.026
You can never
trust nature.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.611
( chuckles )

09:32.530 --> 09:35.950
Why is that guy
looking at you like
he's the boss of you?

09:36.033 --> 09:37.743
( whispers indistinctly )

09:39.203 --> 09:41.247
I think it's because
he is the boss of me.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.915
Oh, all right, then.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.792
Better go
do your thing.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.919
Maybe if I see you
next time,

09:47.003 --> 09:49.588
I'll show you yours
if you show me mine.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.007
Uh...

09:51.090 --> 09:54.218
- ( both laughing )
- Okay, that sounds great.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.054
<i>( packing tape screeching )</i>

10:01.350 --> 10:03.352
Joel:
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

10:03.436 --> 10:07.189
<i>Sorry, um,</i>
<i>I saw online that you guys</i>
<i>do silk screen stuff?</i>

10:07.273 --> 10:10.901
Yeah, we do.
We do the emulsion,
do the press, whole thing.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.779
We got a bunch of T-shirts
if that's what you're
looking for.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.906
Oh, well, honestly,

10:15.990 --> 10:19.327
I just wanted to make
a shirt of this.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.749
You drew these?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.961
- Yeah, I did.
- You drew these yourself?

10:31.589 --> 10:32.965
Yeah.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.759
These are just
all the ones that I've done

10:34.842 --> 10:36.802
since, uh--
since I got here.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.304
They're insane.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.681
I mean, they're insane.
( chuckles )

10:40.765 --> 10:42.224
<i>( music playing )</i>

10:42.308 --> 10:46.354
That's-- okay,
okay, okay, okay.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.356
- So--
- I'm sorry, we'll do it
in a different place.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.859
Let's-- let's ask
some questions here.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.361
Are you Kirby
or are you Moebius?

10:53.444 --> 10:56.238
- Seriously?
- I'm dead serious.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.533
Moebius.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.161
Yeah, that's good.
Good.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.038
- Are you '70s
or are you '80s?
- '70s.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.749
- Both: "M√©tal Hurlant"!
- Yeah, nice!

11:10.378 --> 11:11.796
- Oh.
- Mm.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.089
So, you're not
into the whole, uh...

11:13.172 --> 11:14.924
"Incal" stuff
with Jodorowsky?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.550
- Nah.
- Nah.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.094
- Eh.
- Eh.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.304
Well, that's appropriate.
That's appropriate.

11:20.388 --> 11:24.100
Okay, so within
the "M√©tal Hurlant" era,

11:24.183 --> 11:26.644
- are you "Arzach" or are you...
- Both: "Airtight Garage"?

11:26.727 --> 11:30.022
- "Arzach."
- Okay, but you
got to admit

11:30.106 --> 11:31.899
"Le Garage Herm√©tique,"
that was insane.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.984
Yeah, I guess,
but, I mean,

11:34.068 --> 11:35.611
"Arzach" is all drawing.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.198
Like, I love
that it's the purest
sequential storytelling.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.658
No words.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.201
Do you want
another round?

11:42.284 --> 11:44.412
Uh, yeah.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.913
Let's go, two more.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.040
Yeah, maybe it's--

11:48.124 --> 11:49.917
maybe I'm just not
a words person.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.211
Yeah, okay,
but that's fixable.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.964
You just gotta meet
somebody that, you know--

11:55.047 --> 11:59.218
somebody that maybe is
a words person, you know?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.470
That's easy.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.889
High performance ch--

12:03.973 --> 12:07.143
Chelation
ion chromatography.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.771
It detects trace elements
of rare metals.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.815
What kind of rare metals?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.609
All kinds.

12:15.693 --> 12:19.071
Why are you showing
this to me?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.449
You remember when we had
those guys out here

12:21.532 --> 12:23.117
a couple of weeks ago?

12:23.200 --> 12:27.121
I told you I'd let you know
if they found anything.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.877
Do you want me
to fill you in

12:32.960 --> 12:34.920
before your dad comes?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.755
Why?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.215
Well...

12:39.633 --> 12:41.218
so you can fill him in.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.264
He doesn't need
to know about this.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.646
Olivia:
Well, it's good to see
all the homework you did.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.982
It's nice to know
what all this is worth.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.734
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:56.817 --> 13:00.946
<i>And, uh--</i>
<i>and the offer,</i>

13:01.030 --> 13:02.364
<i>what was that word</i>
<i>that you used?</i>

13:02.448 --> 13:04.241
Uh, the vig?

13:04.325 --> 13:07.870
Yes, the 10% vig.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.497
But, you know.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.416
So-- so, you're not
interested?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.376
Uh, no.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.087
( chuckles )
You know, I was thinking,

13:17.171 --> 13:20.549
you know my dad,
you know how much
he loves this whole area,

13:20.633 --> 13:24.261
how much he loves his views,
his pristine views.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.263
But if there ever
comes a time,

13:26.347 --> 13:30.351
if ever, whenever you think,
"Hey, you know, it's time
to move on from here"...

13:31.894 --> 13:33.896
You know when you'll know
when I'm moving on?

13:33.979 --> 13:37.191
When you're standing
at my gravesite with
whatever's left of my mourners,

13:37.274 --> 13:39.360
and then you can
negotiate with my dogs

13:39.443 --> 13:41.487
<i>or whoever I've left</i>
<i>this place to.</i>

13:41.570 --> 13:43.614
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>since I'm not dead,</i>

13:43.697 --> 13:47.493
why don't we take
this precious moment for me
to offer you a piece of advice?

13:47.576 --> 13:52.498
Why don't you stop dragging
dead rats through the cat flap
to dump at your daddy's feet?

13:52.581 --> 13:54.083
Okay?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.501
- Okay.
- Okay?

13:55.584 --> 13:56.835
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.131
-<i> ( dogs barking )</i>
- Okay.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.051
Okay. Okay.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.096
Joel:
Man, for me?
What are my influences?

14:07.179 --> 14:10.140
Yeah. I mean,
other than the obvious.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
Kirby,
Frank Miller,

14:13.185 --> 14:16.313
- Steranko, Eisner.
- So you know who they are?

14:16.397 --> 14:19.024
- Well, yeah.
- Wow, uh...

14:19.108 --> 14:21.151
No, I've always,
you know, believed in

14:21.235 --> 14:23.571
"standing on the shoulders
of giants" sort of things.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.573
It's a long
fucking way to fall.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.074
- ( chuckles )
- If you're up there,

14:27.157 --> 14:29.785
you better make sure
<i>you've</i> got something.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.915
Oh, everybody's got
an imagination.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.418
Everybody's
got influences.

14:37.501 --> 14:42.089
My question to you
is what's your own
special take on it?

14:46.468 --> 14:50.973
Well, um-- well,
this place is a mess.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.267
Glad we came up here.
We can clean it up.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.685
Yeah.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.313
Well,
you seem strong.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.731
Are you handy?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.691
I'd like
to think so, yeah.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.780
Oof, is it the mirror
or did somebody
steal my ass?

15:06.864 --> 15:07.948
Mm.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.577
Uh...

15:11.660 --> 15:12.911
( exhales )

15:12.995 --> 15:15.456
So, this is where
it all happens.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.249
Well...

15:17.333 --> 15:18.500
yeah.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.044
Michael:
<i>Is the beryllium real?</i>

15:21.295 --> 15:22.671
Very.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.675
So...

15:26.759 --> 15:28.052
So...

15:29.470 --> 15:32.139
some guys came to us
a couple years back--

15:32.222 --> 15:35.601
about a year ago,
actually.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.231
Down in Redding,
a guy named Casey Delacroix

15:41.315 --> 15:42.775
and his partner
Eric Neill.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.652
They were using
pseudonyms.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.445
I never met them,
our guys did.

15:48.238 --> 15:52.993
It was just an uninspired
attempt at a silver scam.

15:53.077 --> 15:57.623
But I had Darenzo
dig a little deeper

15:57.706 --> 15:59.416
into Delacroix and Neill.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.878
Turns out
he found a case

16:02.961 --> 16:08.342
10 years back or so
involving a girl.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.220
24 years old.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.056
Eloise Brand.

16:14.139 --> 16:18.102
<i>A trust fund kid,</i>
<i>a ton of dough,</i>

16:18.185 --> 16:20.521
<i>and she fell in love</i>
<i>with Neill.</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:26.443
-<i> I'm not sure--</i>
- Well, it turns out

16:26.527 --> 16:30.447
it took Neill
nine and a half months
to make that happen.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.033
( chuckles )

16:33.117 --> 16:36.495
- So, he...
-<i> He really worked her.</i>

16:36.578 --> 16:38.372
<i>They were engaged.</i>

16:38.455 --> 16:40.457
( scoffs )

16:40.541 --> 16:42.710
<i>And Neill doesn't deny</i>
<i>the relationship.</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:44.253
<i>He says he got</i>
<i>cold feet.</i>

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
But according
to Darenzo,

16:47.423 --> 16:51.593
the girl's family
came down on him
like a hammer.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.971
<i>But the charges</i>
<i>were dropped</i>

16:54.054 --> 16:59.268
<i>in some kind of bargain</i>
<i>that landed Neill's father</i>
<i>in prison.</i>

17:01.228 --> 17:02.688
He sent his own father
to jail?

17:02.771 --> 17:05.107
In exchange for
his own freedom, yeah.

17:09.945 --> 17:13.240
So, we have a guy
in Turks, John Clifford.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.033
He owes us a little.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.580
He's gonna reach out
to Neill later in the week.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.333
Frank:
<i>So, what, you gonna</i>
<i>sleep in the hay?</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:25.794
<i>Or are you gonna eat the hay</i>
<i>and sleep in the horseshit?</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:27.337
It's an apartment.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.131
It just so happens
to be in a barn.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.258
Oh, I see.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.760
Well, I'm not arguing
against it.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.219
I'm just saying
that here you have a bed,

17:34.303 --> 17:35.304
<i>you don't have to eat,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

17:35.387 --> 17:37.014
Yeah, and it's free.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.601
Well, I mean,
I'm gonna have to work
in exchange for the rent,

17:40.684 --> 17:42.770
but I'll have
complete access
to her studio,

17:42.853 --> 17:46.023
which I get to use--
Olivia Lake's studio.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.442
- And she's going
to look at my stuff.
-<i> ( laughs )</i>

17:48.525 --> 17:51.111
Frank:
<i>Look at your stuff</i>
<i>or look at your junk?</i>

17:51.195 --> 17:54.490
<i>( laughing )</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:56.784
Joel:
<i>She's gonna show it</i>
<i>to her agent.</i>

18:00.204 --> 18:03.207
I-- I still
don't understand.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.542
What do you mean?

18:05.626 --> 18:08.796
She's gonna, like,
show your stuff to people?

18:08.879 --> 18:12.341
- Be like a mentor?
- Yeah.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.467
Why, is that weird?

18:13.550 --> 18:16.136
Laura, this is--
this is huge for me.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.978
And in exchange,
all she wants is help
around the property?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.438
Yeah.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.817
Laura...

18:29.900 --> 18:31.902
what are you
so worried about?

18:33.362 --> 18:36.490
- She makes me nervous.
- How?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.576
I don't trust her.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.828
Man:
<i>Eric?</i>

18:40.911 --> 18:43.580
Eric, hey.
Cliff Jones.
Good to know you.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.999
I'm sorry, I didn't expect
the game to run this long.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.918
-<i> Do you have a bracket?</i>
- No, I--

18:48.001 --> 18:50.420
No, you have better things
to do with your time, right?

18:50.504 --> 18:54.716
- Yeah.
- So, um, you got
my name from...?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.469
People familiar
with your skills.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.389
Come on, we can't not go
all the way this year.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.974
Come on!

19:02.057 --> 19:04.226
So...

19:04.309 --> 19:06.895
- Why are we here?
- Yeah.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.399
Yes, the literal
million dollar question.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.110
I represent a woman,
lives overseas.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.821
Turns out there's
a piece of property
she's had her eye on.

19:15.904 --> 19:19.533
By "had her eye on,"
I mean seems to be
obsessed with.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.577
She's made
generous offers.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.078
But the owner won't sell?

19:23.161 --> 19:25.706
Well, the-- the owner has
what those who know her call

19:25.789 --> 19:27.541
an "unhealthy attachment"
to it.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.294
Unhealthy 'cause
she's overextended.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.754
But-- but I'll tell you what,
those who love her

19:32.838 --> 19:35.132
think she'd actually
be better off...

19:35.215 --> 19:36.341
- Downsizing.
- Right.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.677
In a way,
we're doing her a favor.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.430
All right,
fair enough.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.058
But, long run, she will
be better off is my point.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.853
So, what do you
want me to do?

19:47.936 --> 19:49.813
Get her to sell it.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.274
And why do you think
that I'm particularly--

19:52.357 --> 19:53.442
Eloise Brand.

19:55.861 --> 20:00.324
With deep pockets
comes deep research,
let's say.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.700
What's my end?

20:01.783 --> 20:04.620
Well, when I said it was
a million dollar question...

20:04.703 --> 20:07.080
( chuckling )
I wasn't kidding.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.707
She must really love
this place.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.334
Yeah, it's quite special.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.794
When you see it,
you'll understand.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.212
I get half up front.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.381
( chuckles )
You get 10% up front.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.884
The rest
on close of escrow.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.137
Who handles my expenses?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.431
What's in the bag is what
you have to work with,
all right?

20:24.514 --> 20:27.434
Hey, you do it
with three rubber bands
and a sticky note?

20:27.517 --> 20:28.644
The rest is yours.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.896
My client trusts
you'll figure it out.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.943
2:44, four down.
Come on!

20:36.026 --> 20:38.278
Olivia:
<i>We're recommitting</i>
<i>to the studio.</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:39.655
<i>It's his idea.</i>

20:39.738 --> 20:42.491
<i>Oh, he's gonna paint,</i>
<i>redo the deck.</i>

20:43.951 --> 20:46.370
<i>We're gonna discuss</i>
<i>the rent, TBD.</i>

20:46.453 --> 20:48.997
-<i> Tools are down in the barn.</i>
- JC:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

20:49.081 --> 20:51.041
<i>And the talent?</i>

20:51.124 --> 20:53.502
( blows raspberry )

20:53.585 --> 20:56.088
He's no Enzo,
is he?

20:59.257 --> 21:00.759
Voil√†.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.013
( gasps )
I'm a master chef.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.848
- ( both chuckling )
- Thank you.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.849
Oh.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.439
Okay?

21:16.191 --> 21:18.068
- Good luck.
- It's you I love.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.354
Knock, knock.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.356
Come on in.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.191
Oh, I guess
it's hot in here.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.485
- Yeah. ( chuckles )
- Here, honey.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.654
This was starting to get
a little stinky, so.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.866
Well, it'll be
our first rag.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.492
Our first rag
together.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.202
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.121
- Oh!
- ( both laugh )

22:11.204 --> 22:13.957
- ( sighs )
- Hey, that looks nice.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.293
Yeah, I just wanted
to make it a little bigger.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.753
Some sketching space,

22:17.836 --> 22:21.840
and, plus, you know,
room for two.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.511
Oh, for me to--
pfft.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.473
Why don't we
drown that thought
in a margarita?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.227
- Don't mind if I do.
- All right.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.400
<i>( dog barking</i>
<i>in distance )</i>

22:40.484 --> 22:42.694
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>
- Oh.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.115
Oh, she's early.
Hang on.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.159
Uh, hey!

22:49.242 --> 22:50.786
Hey, there!

22:50.869 --> 22:52.454
Laura:<i> Hi!</i>

22:52.537 --> 22:53.580
Hey.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.665
Wow, this place
is beautiful.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.043
Right?
I knew you'd like it.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.461
Come on.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.296
Oh, wait!
Laura, Laura.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.632
I wanna introduce you
to someone.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.926
Laura,
this is Olivia.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.595
Hi.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.810
So, he said,

23:14.893 --> 23:17.187
"If you could cook,
we could fire the chef."

23:17.270 --> 23:21.191
And I said, "Ernie,
if you could fuck,

23:21.274 --> 23:23.151
we could fire
the chauffeur."

23:24.486 --> 23:26.279
( laughs )

23:31.368 --> 23:32.869
( sighs )

23:34.162 --> 23:35.539
What?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.934
<i>( mechanical whirring )</i>

24:09.739 --> 24:12.659
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter, laughter )

24:15.787 --> 24:17.789
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.291
Man:
Miss Lake!

24:19.374 --> 24:21.543
Dennis Klein.

24:21.626 --> 24:25.380
Thank you for being
so kind and responsive.

24:25.463 --> 24:28.717
I've been seating myself
for decades.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.844
My ass goes here,
right?

24:30.927 --> 24:33.513
Yes, it does, and you want
to face the table.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.140
( chuckles )

24:35.223 --> 24:39.603
At $124,000 for--
for the exploration,

24:39.686 --> 24:42.522
I believe we'd be safe.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.151
<i>Of that,</i>
<i>$10,000 is my fee,</i>

24:46.234 --> 24:48.195
<i>which-- I've given it</i>
<i>some thought</i>

24:48.278 --> 24:51.114
<i>and I'm willing</i>
<i>to waive my fee.</i>

24:51.198 --> 24:54.409
You know,
skin in the game.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.329
So, now we're at 114.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.999
And if what
I suspect is true

25:01.082 --> 25:04.836
<i>turns out</i>
<i>to, in fact, be true,</i>

25:04.920 --> 25:07.589
<i>I would get 10%</i>

25:07.672 --> 25:10.967
<i>of whatever</i>
<i>your ultimate reward</i>
<i>turns out to be.</i>

25:12.052 --> 25:13.637
And we could
reduce that

25:13.720 --> 25:17.766
to-- to 8
or even 7 1/2%

25:17.849 --> 25:21.519
if the upside is where
it may end up being.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.732
<i>And, honestly,</i>

25:25.815 --> 25:29.069
<i>5% is all I would--</i>
<i>um, I would need.</i>

25:29.152 --> 25:32.697
End of the day,
you know, all to be
negotiated.

25:33.823 --> 25:34.908
So, there you have it.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.827
I mean, uh,
you have the material.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.622
Uh, have a look at it.

25:40.705 --> 25:45.418
Uh... and you have
my number.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.589
Give it some thought.
( chuckles )

25:49.673 --> 25:51.800
And, uh-- and I--

25:51.883 --> 25:53.134
it was lovely
to meet you,

25:53.218 --> 25:57.013
and I hope-- I hope to be
hearing from you soon.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.515
Thanks.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.694
Um, excuse me.

26:10.777 --> 26:13.238
I looked over
and I'm like,

26:13.321 --> 26:16.783
"That's the face
from the book I worshipped."

26:16.866 --> 26:19.953
<i>And I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>but I heard</i>

26:20.036 --> 26:23.248
<i>what your friend</i>
<i>was saying.</i>

26:23.331 --> 26:25.083
<i>May I?</i>
<i>I won't stay long.</i>

26:25.166 --> 26:28.086
I've got a 2:00.
Eric Neill. Hi.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.922
-<i> Olivia Lake.</i>
- Yeah, of course you are.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.842
Um, hmm.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.594
You didn't trust
what he said?

26:37.762 --> 26:40.974
My guess is
if you Google him...

26:41.057 --> 26:43.059
He's a geologist?

26:43.143 --> 26:45.020
Professor of geology.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.064
Right, so you'll
follow a few links

26:48.148 --> 26:52.819
and they'll take you
to a university website,
and there he'll be.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.821
But let me guess--
does he have

26:54.904 --> 26:58.074
a sick relative,
an ex-wife, or...?

26:58.158 --> 27:00.660
- ( laughs )
A daughter.
-<i> Perfect.</i>

27:00.744 --> 27:02.370
So, you'll dig
a little deeper

27:02.454 --> 27:06.708
and you'll see something
about her car accident or--

27:06.791 --> 27:10.420
<i>anything-- spina bifida,</i>
<i>some rare blood disease.</i>

27:10.503 --> 27:11.755
<i>"Damn," you'll say,</i>

27:11.838 --> 27:13.798
<i>"the poor guy</i>
<i>is telling the truth."</i>

27:13.882 --> 27:17.594
<i>So then you'll Google--</i>
<i>what was the company</i>
<i>he told you about?</i>

27:19.179 --> 27:20.722
- Ogden Ore.
-<i> Right.</i>

27:20.805 --> 27:23.475
And you'll see
ginormous profits
to Ogden Ore

27:23.558 --> 27:25.602
for recommissioned
silver mines.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.103
But you get a call.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.897
He's having
second thoughts.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.524
He doesn't want to screw
his bosses at the school.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.694
<i>But in your brain,</i>
<i>a tiny voice will be</i>
<i>whispering,</i>

27:34.778 --> 27:38.406
<i>"Ogden Ore made--"</i>
<i>whatever figure</i>
<i>he gave you.</i>

27:38.490 --> 27:40.033
72 million.

27:40.116 --> 27:44.204
"Which buys
a lot of brushes,"
you'll be telling yourself.

27:44.287 --> 27:47.457
<i>And so you'll say,</i>
<i>"The school will be fine.</i>

27:47.540 --> 27:49.709
They just made--"
whatever he said
they made--

27:49.793 --> 27:51.795
"on their own
consulting fees."

27:51.878 --> 27:55.173
And that's when he knows
you're hooked.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.010
And then he...

28:00.136 --> 28:02.013
raises the prices.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.682
He lowers them.

28:04.766 --> 28:08.686
Because it's all about...

28:08.770 --> 28:10.563
Trust.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.910
And you know this
because?

28:23.993 --> 28:25.745
Oh, man.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.081
This was my life
growing up.

28:28.164 --> 28:33.294
My father was
a higher class version
of our friend here.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.176
Meaning?

28:40.260 --> 28:42.095
<i>Ponzi stuff.</i>

28:42.178 --> 28:43.471
<i>Horrible.</i>

28:43.555 --> 28:46.474
<i>People's pensions,</i>
<i>college funds,</i>

28:46.558 --> 28:48.101
retirements.

28:48.184 --> 28:51.062
Yeesh, it's 2:00 already.
Damn.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.773
But that's
my cross to bear,

28:53.857 --> 28:56.234
and I hope I'm wrong
about, uh...

28:57.485 --> 28:58.903
Dennis Klein.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.322
Dennis Klein, yeah.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.826
Anyway, it was
a real pleasure.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.578
Good luck.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.209
Olivia:
<i>His father was some kind</i>
<i>of Ponzi guy or something.</i>

29:13.293 --> 29:17.922
I think Eric feels like
he has some big karma
to unravel.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.176
Really?
Is that what Eric thinks?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.094
What time does
he think it is?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.805
Or should I just
look at a clock?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.098
There he is.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.641
Right there.
What do you think?

29:28.725 --> 29:31.561
You mean that dot
among all those other dots?

29:31.644 --> 29:33.521
I'll let you know
when he gets a little closer.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.774
Oh, no, you're not
getting any closer,
not today.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.902
Calm down.
I will be very subtle.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.613
He's coming.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.323
Okay,
he's coming down.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.991
Get out-- no, wait.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.952
What am I doing here?
I mean, on the premises?

29:48.036 --> 29:51.706
Uh, how about
you were looking for him

29:51.789 --> 29:54.667
and you wanted
to talk to him
to thank him?

29:54.751 --> 29:58.755
No, because everything
he said about Dennis Klein
turned out to be true.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.843
Believe it or not,
sometimes the best way

30:03.927 --> 30:05.345
to sound like
you're telling the truth

30:05.428 --> 30:08.306
is to actually
tell the truth.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.059
Dennis Klein
turned out to be
a hell of a wingman.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.478
I will give you
a very subtle signal.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.271
No, no signals.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.399
It will be
very discreet,
I promissse.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.693
Olivia:
<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

30:20.777 --> 30:22.529
-<i> Hi.</i>
- Oh, hey.

30:22.612 --> 30:26.241
Oh, my rear end
should not be this sore
from four runs.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.909
( laughs )

30:27.992 --> 30:30.036
- How's it going?
- Good.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.163
Well, I saw you
up there, and...

30:32.247 --> 30:34.749
well, you were
just right about everything,
so I wanted to tell you.

30:34.832 --> 30:36.334
- You looked him up?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:38.461
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I just had a hunch</i>

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
and, you know,
so I just said
to him up top,

30:41.005 --> 30:42.674
like, what is up
with you?

30:42.757 --> 30:44.926
And normally,
you would have
trusted that,

30:45.009 --> 30:48.137
but the part of you
that wanted him so badly
to be right...

30:48.221 --> 30:50.848
- Overruled.
- Exactly.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.183
That's what they do, man.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.602
They ride you
through your own doubts

30:54.686 --> 30:57.647
and come out
the other side
like a surfer.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.608
Hey, what was
the, uh, kid thing?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.402
Oh, cancer.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.153
- No.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.489
You'd think he could come up
with something more creative.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.075
Right?
Like tick Lyme.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.661
- Yeah, or pica.
- Wait, what is that?

31:11.744 --> 31:14.706
Pica-- it's the one
where people eat
the nonfood things

31:14.789 --> 31:18.459
like chalk or drywall
or ladders.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.794
<i>( both laugh )</i>

31:19.877 --> 31:21.462
- Eric:<i> I like that.</i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:24.465
- Or the one where
you get old really fast.
- Exactly!

31:24.549 --> 31:26.634
Pictures of the kid
at Disneyland

31:26.718 --> 31:29.304
or meeting LeBron.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.056
Well, you know,
you saved me a lot of money

31:32.140 --> 31:35.518
and, um, I feel
like I owe you,

31:35.602 --> 31:40.690
so let's say I buy you
a drink or something.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.317
- A drink
would be great.
- Okay.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.526
- How about now?
- How about now?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.194
'Cause I'm freezing.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.747
( mouthing words )

31:55.830 --> 31:57.624
Eric:
All right,
I love ski culture.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.375
Nobody steals anything.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.961
I don't know,
it sounds exciting.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.672
I mean, a new company
every few years,

32:04.756 --> 32:06.507
a fresh start,

32:06.591 --> 32:08.676
learning new stuff.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.179
You know, it sounds...

32:11.262 --> 32:14.015
like imprinting,
like a duckling.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.142
( both laugh )

32:16.225 --> 32:17.685
It is.
It was.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.187
It's not, actually.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.148
It's bad,
what I do.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.901
I mean,
it's not illegal,
but it's--

32:24.984 --> 32:29.364
at the end of the day,
basically I did four years
of college

32:29.447 --> 32:33.159
and two years
of business school
to be a...

32:33.242 --> 32:35.495
glorified Grim Reaper.

32:35.578 --> 32:37.288
I find that
hard to believe.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.166
<i>That's what restructuring</i>
<i>a company is.</i>

32:40.249 --> 32:44.545
You decide who lives
and who has to go home

32:44.629 --> 32:47.090
and break the news
to the wife and kids.

32:47.173 --> 32:50.051
That just doesn't
seem like you.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.970
I mean,
it's my head, anyway.

32:53.054 --> 32:56.391
<i>Well, that's actually</i>
<i>why I'm here.</i>

32:56.474 --> 33:00.311
I'm trying to get away
and do a little rebooting,

33:00.395 --> 33:04.107
which is why--
I'm really sorry,
but I gotta run.

33:04.190 --> 33:07.235
I'm meeting a headhunter
in Salt Lake

33:07.318 --> 33:09.320
and I'm already...

33:09.404 --> 33:11.030
Well, go.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.534
- Hunt those heads.
-<i> ( chuckles )</i>

33:14.617 --> 33:18.413
Um, but this was...

33:19.706 --> 33:20.915
You know what?

33:20.998 --> 33:23.626
I'm too hungry
to drive to Salt Lake.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.045
How about you?

33:26.129 --> 33:27.672
I could eat.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.883
So, Eric says,
"He couldn't come up

33:30.967 --> 33:33.761
with something
more original than that?"

33:33.845 --> 33:37.890
Then we start riffing
on all these weird diseases.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.434
( laughs )

33:39.517 --> 33:41.602
I guess you had
to be there.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.439
Anyway,
so, he's here

33:44.522 --> 33:47.150
because he's gonna be
carving up some company,

33:47.233 --> 33:49.736
but, you know,
he's kind of--

33:49.819 --> 33:52.655
he's had
a change of heart

33:52.739 --> 33:54.657
and he wants
to change his life.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.452
So, I mean, that's what
he's doing here today.

33:57.535 --> 34:01.038
He was gonna go
to Salt Lake City
and meet this headhunter,

34:01.122 --> 34:05.084
and--
but he cancelled it

34:05.168 --> 34:08.129
so that he could
have dinner with me.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.298
Yeah.
( laughs )

34:10.381 --> 34:13.509
And-- look, I gotta go.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.344
Otherwise he's gonna think
that I have been

34:15.428 --> 34:18.222
in the bathroom
the whole time.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.224
<i>( Olivia laughs )</i>
<i>A mirror?</i>

34:20.308 --> 34:24.604
Eric:
Well, no, you're more
like pieces of a mirror.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.940
"Who does the public
see me as" is one piece.

34:28.024 --> 34:32.153
"The socialite,
life of the party"
is another piece.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.780
Artist piece.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.323
Confident, mature woman.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.950
Vulnerable little girl.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.411
The charity.
But what's behind it?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.121
That's what
I'm curious about.

34:42.205 --> 34:46.167
Oh, well, there's a reason
you only hang a painting
facing out.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.421
Who wants to see
all the wires and tacks
and framing?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.048
- Me.
- Oh!

34:52.131 --> 34:54.217
And I don't know for sure
because I'm not an artist,

34:54.300 --> 34:56.010
but my sister is one.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.679
Well, she wants to be,
but she wouldn't
tell you that.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.389
She'd tell you
she has no interest.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.849
I don't believe you.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.311
- About my sister?
- No, you. You.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.688
You're an actor.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.983
Okay,
since we're baring all,

35:11.067 --> 35:14.070
I once, in middle school,
did a one-man show.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.281
So lame, but I learned
my lesson fast.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.992
And my mother
was a decorator.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.994
Well, that's artisty.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.331
And my dad,
definitely not.

35:25.414 --> 35:26.666
Wrong.

35:26.749 --> 35:30.044
You told me yourself
he was a con...

35:30.127 --> 35:34.090
Con artist.
Oh, my God, you're right.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.300
He's probably
the best artist
of all of us.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.885
Ugh.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.554
Where was I?

35:39.637 --> 35:42.974
Uh... me.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.726
( chuckles )
That's right.

35:45.810 --> 35:51.649
The biggest piece
under the 85 million pieces
of Olivia Lake--

35:51.732 --> 35:54.902
loneliness
is what I see.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.864
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>everything else</i>
<i>is covering up--</i>

35:57.947 --> 36:01.409
<i>the desire to connect</i>
<i>and the inability to,</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:03.119
<i>for whatever reason.</i>

36:03.202 --> 36:04.912
<i>Am I close?</i>

36:04.996 --> 36:06.664
<i>Too close?</i>

36:06.747 --> 36:08.499
( hisses )

36:08.583 --> 36:11.335
Eric.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.422
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

36:14.505 --> 36:19.135
-<i> Tell me about your play.</i>
- ( laughs )

36:19.218 --> 36:20.761
Ah, I was too close.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.222
We're changing the subject.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.017
<i>What was it called?</i>

36:26.100 --> 36:27.184
"The Impersonator."

36:29.645 --> 36:31.272
I love that.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.649
<i>It was me doing a bunch</i>
<i>of lame impressions--</i>

36:33.733 --> 36:36.944
famous people,
other kids at the school,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.738
some characters
I made up,

36:38.821 --> 36:42.450
but essentially
they all ended up
sounding like vampires.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.243
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

36:44.327 --> 36:47.413
Because I think
kids' art

36:47.496 --> 36:53.294
is 100% a declaration
of who they are.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.088
I think it's--

36:56.172 --> 36:59.800
it's maybe the last time
we tell the truth.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.722
That's probably true.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.310
Oh, my God.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.687
I think we're keeping
these people from going home.

37:11.771 --> 37:12.980
I'm so sorry.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.775
( laughing )
We'll take the check.

37:15.858 --> 37:20.696
Olivia:
"She takes those kids
up the trail, like...

37:20.780 --> 37:25.159
three times a day
and tells her story
over and over.

37:25.242 --> 37:28.913
- It's pathetic."
- Why would they write
that stuff?

37:28.996 --> 37:32.959
Because it was
like that for a while.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.543
( sighs )

37:34.627 --> 37:37.964
- Even I thought
it was pathetic.
- Uh...

37:38.047 --> 37:43.052
You know,
when I built these, I...

37:43.135 --> 37:47.181
( laughs )
I felt like
that North Korean guy.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.683
( laughs )
What?

37:48.766 --> 37:52.436
Like I was building
a monument to my own ego.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.940
No, you were just
trying to make something
kind of permanent

37:56.023 --> 38:01.570
out of what always felt
like a one-time, fleeting...

38:01.654 --> 38:03.614
miracle, really.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.825
I read somewhere
the whole story

38:05.908 --> 38:08.202
came out of a dream.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.912
Is that...?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.998
I mean...

38:12.081 --> 38:13.791
just look.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.418
It was like a--

38:15.501 --> 38:19.046
like a star
just fell down
from the heavens

38:19.130 --> 38:22.174
and I was holding
a basket.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.760
I wrote it all down
in 45 seconds

38:24.844 --> 38:27.763
and drew it
in two weeks, and...

38:29.515 --> 38:32.768
That was 26 years ago.

38:32.852 --> 38:37.023
So, it doesn't feel
like it came from you.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.524
'Cause if it did,

38:38.607 --> 38:42.486
why can't you
get there again?

38:42.570 --> 38:46.699
But, hey, look,
it got you all this.

38:48.576 --> 38:52.038
- Which is insane.
- ( laughs )

38:52.121 --> 38:54.957
And I'm guessing
it must be a--

38:55.041 --> 38:57.752
a lot to maintain.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.629
( sighs )
The land or the life?

39:00.713 --> 39:02.923
Well, both.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.926
Well, the land
has a crew.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.262
I've had to let
a lot of them go.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.931
I've got a boarder
down in the barn.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.601
He helps if I can get him
to do anything.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.565
But, yeah, it's hard.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.152
And the life?

39:23.235 --> 39:26.030
What are we
if not our life?

39:30.826 --> 39:34.246
I'm trying to decide
if I should invite you in.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.084
You know
what I think?

39:38.167 --> 39:40.002
Eric...

39:41.837 --> 39:44.006
you gotta let me
do this one.

39:46.342 --> 39:50.805
The night lasts longer
if we don't.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.268
That's what I want.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.566
I appreciate that.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.485
I would like
to call you, though,

40:04.568 --> 40:06.570
if that's okay
with you.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.245
I would like that.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.251
Eric's voice:
<i>That's what I'm curious about.</i>

40:20.334 --> 40:22.837
<i>Well, maybe that's why</i>
<i>you do art.</i>

40:22.920 --> 40:24.713
<i>Like-- I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm not an artist,</i>

40:24.797 --> 40:28.300
but maybe deep down
you're lonely

40:28.384 --> 40:33.347
and your art is a way
to connect, to bridge.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.932
I don't know.

40:35.015 --> 40:38.018
Are you lonely?

40:38.102 --> 40:41.188
<i>That's the biggest take</i>
<i>I get.</i>

40:41.272 --> 40:45.359
<i>I'm just kind of wondering</i>
<i>if you're...</i>

40:45.442 --> 40:47.570
<i>sort of all alone</i>
<i>out here.</i>

40:51.407 --> 40:53.159
Olivia's voice:
<i>He says he wants to see</i>
<i>through all this,</i>

40:53.242 --> 40:54.702
<i>but he doesn't.</i>

40:54.785 --> 40:57.788
<i>You know that, right?</i>
<i>People don't.</i>

40:57.872 --> 41:01.667
<i>They say they do,</i>
<i>but then they don't.</i>

41:01.750 --> 41:03.919
<i>When they see</i>
<i>what's really there...</i>

41:04.003 --> 41:06.005
<i>He won't-- he won't want</i>
<i>to see it or...</i>

41:06.088 --> 41:09.133
<i>ha, ha, fucking ha,</i>
<i>he does.</i>

41:09.216 --> 41:11.886
<i>And then he will.</i>
<i>And then what happens then?</i>

41:11.969 --> 41:16.599
<i>( sighs )</i>
<i>What happens</i>
<i>when he actually sees in?</i>

41:19.101 --> 41:20.561
( sighs )

41:22.855 --> 41:26.108
Eric:<i> Report back?</i>
<i>Okay, here's what you're</i>
<i>gonna report back.</i>

41:26.192 --> 41:29.361
Olivia Lake is<i> not</i>
a Nespresso machine.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.864
You don't just punch in
a cartridge,

41:31.947 --> 41:34.825
push a button,
and expect... boom.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.956
And I'm working
my ass off.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.000
Who is this client,
anyway?

41:47.254 --> 41:49.423
She's a fucking
human being, okay?

41:49.506 --> 41:51.759
And I'm beginning to wonder
if your precious client

41:51.842 --> 41:54.261
actually isn't one.

41:54.345 --> 41:58.599
Look, either
just let me do my job
or give me the high sign

41:58.682 --> 42:01.977
and she can have
her money back minus
what I've already spent.

42:04.521 --> 42:07.066
I'll talk to you later.

42:07.149 --> 42:09.193
( stammering )
I'm working on it.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.111
Jesus Christ.
Goodbye.

42:15.241 --> 42:18.244
Man:
<i>Stay the course.</i>

42:18.327 --> 42:19.870
You don't think
he's going soft?

42:22.164 --> 42:23.540
Maybe.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.795
There's a 9:15
out of Salt Lake,
connects in Dallas,

42:27.878 --> 42:29.338
and then straight on
to Marseille.

42:29.421 --> 42:32.549
<i>Give my best to Thelma.</i>

42:32.633 --> 42:34.093
So, what...?

42:35.594 --> 42:36.887
Oh, okay.

42:36.971 --> 42:40.307
Ahem, um,
look, I can stay,
ride him harder.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.935
<i>No, I don't want</i>
<i>to risk anything.</i>

42:43.018 --> 42:44.812
<i>We'll give him</i>
<i>some space.</i>

42:44.895 --> 42:48.232
<i>Don't call him again</i>
<i>unless he calls you first.</i>

42:48.315 --> 42:49.692
Okay.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.530
What about
the rest of my end?

42:55.990 --> 42:58.450
Your end is what
it all always was.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.035
He converts,
you get whole.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.246
Either way,
your debt's clear.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.292
Um...

43:08.127 --> 43:11.964
if I may, what's this
really all about?

43:12.047 --> 43:14.591
Michael:
<i>My father just really loved</i>
<i>the pristine views</i>

43:14.675 --> 43:16.927
and I wanted to do
something nice for him.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.182
Thanks for coming in
on this.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.195
Hi!

43:35.279 --> 43:37.656
- You home?
- Olivia:<i> In the kitchen.</i>

43:45.748 --> 43:47.833
( chuckles )

43:55.382 --> 43:57.926
Oh, you look like
you just took a shit
on my carpet

43:58.010 --> 43:59.553
and wiped your ass
on the drapes.

43:59.636 --> 44:01.472
- What gives?
- I can't tell you.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.557
Really? You came
all the way over here

44:03.640 --> 44:05.893
for something
you cannot tell me?

44:05.976 --> 44:06.894
Fuck off.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.062
Okay, I can tell you.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.898
Eric spent two days
last week in Mosaic.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.024
In the gallery.

44:12.107 --> 44:13.984
Alyssa told me this.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.487
It's a secret.

44:16.570 --> 44:19.239
He was apparently
grilling her

44:19.323 --> 44:21.742
all about the business
schmegegge,

44:21.825 --> 44:23.369
which is what
those VC guys call it

44:23.452 --> 44:25.663
when they're not
out headhunting.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.873
She thinks he wants
to pitch you on the idea

44:27.956 --> 44:29.917
to take Mosaic
and build it out

44:30.000 --> 44:33.587
to a whole bunch of offices
in a whole bunch of cities.

44:33.670 --> 44:36.590
You have to swear
I didn't say any
of this to you.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.719
Wow.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.810
That is awesome
that Alyssa didn't tell me.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.603
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>
- Oh.

44:49.686 --> 44:51.814
So she gets kudos
for keeping this a secret?

44:51.897 --> 44:54.858
I didn't say
life was fair.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.403
He's on his way over here.
You gotta go.

45:01.323 --> 45:03.909
( whispers )
I'll just be squatting
under the table. Shh.

45:03.992 --> 45:06.703
However much I wish
you could, beat it.

45:10.999 --> 45:13.001
Hey.

45:13.085 --> 45:16.380
I'm sorry
I've been out of touch
the last few days.

45:16.463 --> 45:19.174
I had
some work stuff.

45:19.258 --> 45:22.886
Well, I was intrigued
by your text.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.346
- May I?
- Yeah.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.015
Since we met, I've been
thinking about you,

45:27.099 --> 45:29.476
about some stuff
you said.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.313
You said that the book
happened once

45:33.397 --> 45:36.191
in 45 seconds,
26 years ago,

45:36.275 --> 45:40.112
so my question to you is
what if the entire book

45:40.195 --> 45:43.824
was only
the first chapter

45:43.907 --> 45:46.827
in what your actual legacy
turned out to be?

45:48.871 --> 45:53.834
So, the story
of the legacy
of Olivia Lake--

45:53.917 --> 45:55.252
what is it?

45:56.795 --> 46:00.507
From a dream
Olivia imagines
a classic.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.342
On the strength
of that classic

46:02.426 --> 46:06.180
she imagines a charity
where thousands of kids

46:06.263 --> 46:08.849
have created things
from their own dreams
already.

46:08.932 --> 46:11.560
So, what's next?

46:11.643 --> 46:14.021
<i>I quit my job,</i>
<i>and there's no going back,</i>

46:14.104 --> 46:18.400
it would appear,
which ushers in
chapter three.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.986
I-- I can't believe
you quit your job.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.447
It's not about me.
So, chapter three.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.282
I went by the gallery
on Monday

46:25.365 --> 46:29.661
and I see
all these groups
of kids come in

46:29.745 --> 46:33.332
and look at art
and show their own art
and make art,

46:33.415 --> 46:37.544
and I'm thinking,
"Why are they bussing
them in from Salt Lake?

46:37.628 --> 46:40.506
Why don't they just open one
right in Salt Lake?"

46:40.589 --> 46:44.051
And then I think,
"Why just Salt Lake?"

46:44.134 --> 46:48.722
So, my pitch to you is
what if chapter three

46:48.805 --> 46:51.183
in the legacy
of Olivia Lake

46:51.266 --> 46:55.145
<i>is phase one:</i>
<i>five cities--</i>

46:55.229 --> 46:59.483
Salt Lake, Cheyenne, Denver,
Albuquerque, Phoenix.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.861
Phase two:
five-year plan.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.949
Phase three:
20-year plan.

47:07.032 --> 47:10.410
And just 'cause it was late
and I was getting punchy...

47:14.748 --> 47:16.792
Told you
I'm not an artist.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.796
Thoughts?

47:27.302 --> 47:28.846
What do you think?

47:36.144 --> 47:39.565
<i>( music playing )</i>
