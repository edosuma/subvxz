WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.372
* *

00:04.472 --> 00:05.973
- Hey, Spence, how was
your date last night?

00:06.074 --> 00:08.809
- (groans) I hate
to tell you guys this,

00:08.909 --> 00:11.545
turns out I did not match
with Zoe Saldana.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.515
It was an old lady
named Gretel.

00:14.615 --> 00:18.319
- Oh, Spencer. How much money
did you give Gretel?

00:18.419 --> 00:21.189
- (scoffs) One briefcase.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.457
Two briefcases.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.792
- You know, I did read
in The New Yorker

00:24.892 --> 00:27.795
about a dating app
called "Word Bang."

00:27.895 --> 00:30.364
You can only text the person.
There's no picture,

00:30.464 --> 00:33.367
so the attraction
has to be cerebral.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.935
I might give that a shot.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.970
- You did not read about that
in The New Yorker.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.272
I told you about that.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.208
- I said I'll sign up!

00:40.308 --> 00:42.576
Right after my date
with Eva Mendes.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.545
She has two kids
with Ryan Gosling.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.047
- He's coming too.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.351
- Are you guys talking
about my birthday party?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.719
Should I come back?

00:51.819 --> 00:53.321
- Oh, no.
Did you hear us planning

00:53.421 --> 00:54.755
the bacchanal
at the sex dungeon?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.657
That's what you wanted, right?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.992
You're obsessed
with your birthday.

00:59.093 --> 01:02.296
- Uh, yeah. Because birthday
parties are the best.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.265
Birthday cake
is the best food.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.799
Birthday presents
are the best gifts,

01:05.899 --> 01:08.068
and "Happy Birthday,"
the song,

01:08.169 --> 01:09.870
straight banger.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.772
- Well, we weren't talking
about your party,

01:11.872 --> 01:13.641
but don't worry.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.975
Pearl's gonna get us
up to speed later,

01:15.075 --> 01:17.278
and she's been
working on it nonstop.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.780
- You don't think she feels
too much pressure, do you?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.715
- Why? Because you keep
telling her

01:21.815 --> 01:23.284
that the first birthday
in a relationship

01:23.384 --> 01:25.453
determines whether the couple
will go the distance?

01:25.553 --> 01:27.921
Nah, I'm sure
that barely registered.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.057
- Okay, okay. Maybe
I've been a little intense.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.460
I just feel so good
about where things are

01:32.560 --> 01:34.528
with me and Pearl,
and I know she is gonna nail it.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.096
- Oh, I'm sure she will.

01:36.197 --> 01:40.568
You've been very clear
you want a murder mystery party.

01:40.668 --> 01:44.505
- So the theme
of the party is crows.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.143
- Maybe he
could've been clearer.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.780
- * I know you see *

01:52.880 --> 01:55.249
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:55.349 --> 01:58.686
* And be so wonderful *

01:58.786 --> 02:02.756
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

02:02.856 --> 02:04.758
* It's your time to be *

02:04.858 --> 02:07.428
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

02:07.528 --> 02:09.062
* And the time to see *

02:09.163 --> 02:13.133
* The brighter side
of every situation *

02:13.234 --> 02:15.169
* Some things
are meant to be *

02:15.269 --> 02:18.972
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me *

02:20.040 --> 02:21.742
* *

02:21.842 --> 02:23.911
- Everyone knows
it's no mystery

02:24.011 --> 02:26.314
that a group of crows
is called a murder.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.948
So, naturally,
he wants a party

02:28.048 --> 02:31.118
all about
our fine-feathered friends.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.588
- Pearl, I-I don't think
that that's what he meant

02:34.688 --> 02:37.124
when he said,
"Murder mystery."

02:37.225 --> 02:38.826
- Carly, I'm his girlfriend.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.894
I think I know
what he means.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.997
- Devil's advocate,
there is a whole genre

02:44.097 --> 02:47.601
of parties where people pretend
there's a human murder,

02:47.701 --> 02:50.037
and then they role-play
and they wear costumes

02:50.137 --> 02:51.705
and you have to figure out
who did it

02:51.805 --> 02:54.608
that I happen to know
Freddie is obsessed with.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.045
- In addition
to his obsession with crows.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.650
- Devil's advocate,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.385
I feel pretty good
about this crow idea.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.787
And not just because
I already bought 400 fake birds

03:06.887 --> 03:09.357
that aren't returnable
because I got them wet.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.360
Well, double Devil's advocate,

03:12.460 --> 03:15.062
Freddie seemed to want
a very specific kind of game

03:15.162 --> 03:16.897
that would be perfect
and also is very different

03:16.997 --> 03:19.166
from this and also
he sent us a website

03:19.267 --> 03:21.535
with a bunch of kits
to choose from.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.840
- Oh. God, this is
so embarrassing.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.776
Mm.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.878
Okay, yeah, I guess
we should choose a kit.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.846
But can we all agree
he really should've been clearer

03:32.946 --> 03:34.648
about which kind
of murder he meant?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.384
- Mm-hmm. Every time
I'm watching the local news

03:36.484 --> 03:39.119
and they talk about murder,
I'm like, "Where are the crows?"

03:41.255 --> 03:42.656
- Oh, this kit looks good.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.892
"Duck, Duck, Goose:
Tag, You're Dead."

03:44.992 --> 03:49.397
- Uh-huh,
that's another bird idea.

03:49.497 --> 03:54.368
- Or, uh...
"Murder at the Disco."

03:54.468 --> 03:56.604
You know, Freddie
loves disco music,

03:56.704 --> 03:58.739
and we could wear
really fun '70s costumes.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.240
- (squeals)
- It'll be perfect.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.776
- Disco? I didn't even know
Freddie liked music.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.412
One time I put on
Imagine Dragons

04:04.512 --> 04:06.013
and he
didn't even tap his foot.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.581
You know...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.550
Maybe you should
just plan the party.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.285
Clearly I
don't know him at all.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.455
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.490
You-you do.

04:16.590 --> 04:21.228
Harper and I are just going off
what he's saying with words.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.830
Boring.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.165
You're his girlfriend.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.502
You guys have
an erotic connection

04:28.602 --> 04:30.871
that we could
never understand.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.774
We can do both ideas.

04:33.874 --> 04:38.979
Oh, what about...
"Saturday Flight Fever:

04:39.079 --> 04:40.948
Murder
at the Dis-Crow."

04:41.048 --> 04:42.149
- Mm.

04:43.250 --> 04:47.154
- Is it too late to change
my RSVP to maybe?

04:47.254 --> 04:50.458
* *

04:50.558 --> 04:53.794
(crow cawing)

04:59.533 --> 05:00.468
(both squeal)

05:00.568 --> 05:02.035
- Foxy Brown.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.105
- And Cher... Wait, does she
have a last name?

05:05.205 --> 05:07.675
- I think it's Horowitz.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.311
- Okay, Harper,
all we have to do tonight

05:11.412 --> 05:13.814
is make this the perfect
birthday party for Freddie,

05:13.914 --> 05:16.884
and make sure he thinks
that Pearl planned it all.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.753
- It's funny how you say "we."

05:20.488 --> 05:22.089
- I'm serious.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.224
This is important for Freddie,
but it's also important

05:24.324 --> 05:26.193
for Pearl and Freddie
as a couple.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.996
Now, I made
the perfect guest list.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.931
I even got that old guy
that Freddie met

05:31.031 --> 05:33.033
on the Reddit thread
about digestive issues.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.668
- Oh, my God.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.371
We finally
get to meet Ronald?

05:37.471 --> 05:39.473
- Okay, David Bowie.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.809
- Ah? Oh! Whoa.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.412
I bought these shoes when
I was dating that WNBA player,

05:44.512 --> 05:47.381
then she dumped me
for buying these shoes.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.553
- I really relate
to Linda Blair

05:52.653 --> 05:54.154
from The Exorcist.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.623
Although she was possessed
by a demon

05:55.723 --> 05:58.258
whilst I am possessed
by... love.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
- Let me tell you,
baking this cake

06:01.762 --> 06:04.465
was no cabaret, old chum.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.600
My granddaughter is a nightmare.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.001
- Cause she's from
The Exorcist?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.237
I haven't seen it,
but the Wikipedia page

06:10.337 --> 06:12.473
was so scary.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.074
You're gonna love that cake.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.609
We made it light and fluffy,

06:15.709 --> 06:18.078
like my boyfriend
Derek Fox-Lubiner's hair.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.614
- We didn't do anything.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.784
Somebody was too busy
on her phone to help me bake.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.786
(dolphin sound effect)

06:25.886 --> 06:27.421
- Oh, that's Derek.
He's messaging me

06:27.521 --> 06:30.323
from the dolphin sound app.
It's called "Dolphone."

06:30.424 --> 06:31.859
(dolphin sound effect)

06:31.959 --> 06:34.628
- So you just send dolphin
sounds back and forth?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.430
That is ridiculous.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.331
- In case you were ever
wondering when you became

06:38.432 --> 06:40.668
an old person,
this is the moment.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.337
- All right. Listen,
you guys know how important

06:44.438 --> 06:46.774
birthdays are to Freddie,
so if any of you

06:46.874 --> 06:47.808
screw this
murder mystery up,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.510
I swear on all your lives,

06:49.610 --> 06:53.481
I will change the passwords
to all my streaming services.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.549
- (gasps)
- You wouldn't.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.652
Next week is
the Toledo House Flip finale.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.154
Try me.
Mess around and find out.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.324
- Hi.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.326
- Hey, Pearl!

07:06.426 --> 07:08.696
- Ooh, what are you, uh...
old Freddie?

07:08.796 --> 07:10.864
- No. Richard Nixon.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.301
Freddie loves Nixon.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.604
- Freddie loves Cynthia Nixon.

07:16.704 --> 07:21.041
I know, it's weird because
he is such a Charlotte.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.976
- What's wrong?

07:23.076 --> 07:26.346
- Okay, Freddie is terrified
of Richard Nixon.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.981
- What do you mean?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.717
- He got locked in the gift shop
with all the masks

07:29.817 --> 07:30.984
at the presidential library.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.853
It was a whole thing.
- Oh, God.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.221
What do I--?
What do I do?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.757
- Maybe say
you're Cynthia Nixon's dad?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.259
- Well, I brought crow dip.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.095
And before you ask, no,
there aren't crows in it.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.700
Oh...
Are there rats?

07:46.800 --> 07:50.070
Because it tastes like what
I think rats would taste like.

07:50.170 --> 07:54.474
- And birthday boy
Sonny Bono here.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.909
Uh, you guys look amazing.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.913
Exorcist, Foxy Brown,
Liza Minelli,

08:00.013 --> 08:01.515
David Bowie...

08:01.615 --> 08:04.918
- Hey! Sonny and Cher.
You and Carly match perfectly.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.820
- Yeah. How fun.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.255
- Yeah, how fun.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.923
- No!

08:12.092 --> 08:14.327
Please tell me
you're Cynthia Nixon's dad.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.798
- I'm... I'm--
- About to go change!

08:17.898 --> 08:19.499
Yeah, Pearl and I
are gonna switch outfits

08:19.600 --> 08:21.602
because there was some mix-up,
but the party's going great,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.971
and Pearl came up
with everything.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.506
- You did. Thank you.
The disco theme is amazing.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.308
I don't really get
the whole crow thing though.

08:28.408 --> 08:33.380
- Oh. Uh, they're--
They're 1970s crows.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.650
- Oh. Cool. Yeah.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.419
Okay.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.221
I still don't get it.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.191
* *

08:44.291 --> 08:46.960
- Heads up,
I'm peacing out early.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.495
I got me
a date on Word Bang

08:48.596 --> 08:50.030
that can only meet tonight,

08:50.130 --> 08:51.899
and we all know the slipping off
without saying a word is

08:51.999 --> 08:53.934
much kinder
than a heartfelt goodbye.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.903
- No way.
I also have a Word Bang date

08:56.003 --> 08:58.505
and was planning
an Irish Goodbye.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.607
Wait, is that offensive?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.208
- No, the Irish are fine.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.910
And hopefully
so is my date.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.978
He's a globe-trotting
bon vivant

09:05.078 --> 09:06.880
with an expensive palate.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.349
- My date is a delightfully
witty bookworm.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.185
And I find that hot
because I'm attracted to brains.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.287
Also boobs,
thighs and butts.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.925
Party back on track.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.492
- Ooh, you fit so nicely

09:19.593 --> 09:22.529
into Fredward's
Saturday Night Fever costume.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.632
- Now, as soon as the rest
of the guests get here,

09:24.732 --> 09:25.766
we can start the mystery.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.467
- Oh, this is everyone.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.236
Freddie said he didn't want
to make a big deal of it.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.871
That he didn't need
all the attention.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.174
- Oh, no.
He-he says that every year,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.343
just to try to be humble.

09:36.443 --> 09:39.579
He also says that he doesn't
want any gifts, but obviously--

09:39.680 --> 09:41.448
He means that part.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.518
- Hey, looking good, ladies.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.487
- Hey, look at your suits.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.123
You and Carly match
even better than before.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.694
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.830
- Hey, uh, so when's everybody
else getting here?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.265
- Never.
I'm sorry, I didn't--

09:58.365 --> 10:00.067
- I didn't invite
anyone else,

10:00.167 --> 10:02.569
because you wanted
the party to be intimate.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.037
Good call, Pearl.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.440
- Wait.
So Ronald isn't coming?

10:07.540 --> 10:08.776
No!

10:08.876 --> 10:12.379
- Spencer, if there are
only seven guests,

10:12.479 --> 10:14.081
then two people
can't leave.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.149
- Okay. New plan.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.151
We make a new birth certificate
that says his birthday

10:18.251 --> 10:19.653
is next month, then we call
my friend Sully,

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
fake our own deaths,
and flee to the Maldives.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.725
- What about our dates?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.559
- We're way past that.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.362
* *

10:29.863 --> 10:32.065
- It's 1977.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.366
The streets are
full of trash

10:33.466 --> 10:35.602
and the people
ain't much cleaner.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.972
We find ourselves
at a grimy discotheque

10:39.072 --> 10:41.274
called Studio 55.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.545
Police arrive to discover
there was a grisly murder.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.480
- (gasps) Ooh, how grisly?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.082
- Very grisly.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.518
All right, now it's time
to draw cards

10:51.618 --> 10:53.620
to find out
which characters we all play.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.259
- I'm, "Claudia Skies,
a persnickety flight attendant

10:59.359 --> 11:00.928
who's unlucky in love."

11:01.028 --> 11:02.629
Don't know what that's like.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.333
- You'd probably also struggle
with my character,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.736
"Anita Hug,
a loving granddaughter

11:08.836 --> 11:11.705
who snuck into the club
to respect her elders."

11:12.806 --> 11:18.078
- Ooh, I'm... "DeDe Bustier,
a sexy secretary

11:18.178 --> 11:22.983
ready to sleep--
Uh, nap her way to the top."

11:23.984 --> 11:27.554
- I'm... "Pablo Pi-queso,
a wealthy artist

11:27.654 --> 11:29.556
turned restaurateur."

11:29.656 --> 11:30.991
I don't understand
this character.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.659
I-I don't know
how to play this.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.163
- Let's see. I'm...
"The detective,

11:36.263 --> 11:39.332
Sergeant Bellbottoms,
whose brother is the victim."

11:39.432 --> 11:43.270
(gasps) Well, I'm going
to find out which one of you

11:43.370 --> 11:48.708
sick freaks did this
to my brother... "Elton Don."

11:50.277 --> 11:54.414
- And I'm...
"The detective's wife."

11:54.882 --> 11:56.249
- Perfect.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.987
- "Your soulmate chemistry
with your husband

12:00.087 --> 12:03.223
"cannot be denied.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.159
"Note: You and your husband
could never be mistaken

12:06.259 --> 12:09.429
for friends."

12:09.529 --> 12:11.631
Uh, Pearl,
why don't we just switch?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.533
- It's fine.
- It only makes sense...

12:13.633 --> 12:15.435
- I don't want to.
- Come on.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.937
- No, I can't switch
because I'm the murderer!

12:17.037 --> 12:19.406
- Whoa! Come on!
- (others groaning)

12:19.506 --> 12:21.141
Sorry. I...

12:26.246 --> 12:29.249
- What do we do now?
The murder mystery is over.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.918
- I'm sorry, Freddie.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.053
I guess that means
the party is over too.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.587
- Do you wanna share an Uber?

12:34.687 --> 12:37.290
- Jennifer R will
be out front in three.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.560
- What are you talking about?

12:40.660 --> 12:44.731
You think a murder mystery party
is all about the murder mystery?

12:44.832 --> 12:47.434
- It's right there
in the name, so...

12:47.534 --> 12:50.603
- But... Pearl and I have
so many more things planned.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.406
- We do?
- You do?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.775
- Uh, yeah! You tell him.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.545
- Oh. Uh, she must mean
my riff

12:58.645 --> 12:59.880
on "Pin the tail
on the donkey,"

12:59.980 --> 13:01.481
only instead
of a donkey, it's--

13:01.581 --> 13:03.150
- A crow?
- Oh, you've played it?

13:03.250 --> 13:07.921
- Hey. Hey. Where do you two
think you're-- (gasps)

13:08.021 --> 13:11.224
You're trying to do
an Irish Goodbye.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.692
Wait, is that offensive?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.895
BOTH: The Irish are fine.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.563
- You know how important
this party is

13:16.663 --> 13:17.898
to Freddie's relationship
with Pearl.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.366
- Then he of all people
should know

13:19.466 --> 13:21.101
how important this date is
to my relationship

13:21.201 --> 13:23.603
with a woman
I've never met.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.405
- We want to be here
for Freddie,

13:25.505 --> 13:28.808
and we know how hard you worked
on this, but face it,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.678
Freddie's mama recapping
an episode of Yellowstone

13:31.778 --> 13:33.646
was the highlight of the night.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.850
- Well-- There's also cake
and a disco playlist

13:36.950 --> 13:39.052
and drinks
that need to happen.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.055
- Fine. We will stay
for cake and dancing

13:42.155 --> 13:43.556
and, okay,
we'll drink heavily,

13:43.656 --> 13:45.392
but after that
we are out of here.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.660
Hey, hey, hey! I am famished.
Who wants cake?

13:47.760 --> 13:48.828
- I'll get the candles.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.331
- Uh-uh. No time.
Everybody, sing.

13:51.431 --> 13:57.104
ALL:
* Happy birthday to you *

13:57.204 --> 13:58.771
* Happy birthday-- *
- You know what?

13:58.872 --> 14:01.341
I have always thought
that song was too slow.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.510
(faster):
* Happy birthday, dear Freddie *

14:03.610 --> 14:05.178
* Happy birthday to you *

14:05.278 --> 14:07.180
- Spencer, give me the cake.
You're gonna drop it.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.215
- (grunts)

14:08.315 --> 14:09.917
(screams)

14:15.688 --> 14:17.457
- It's colder
than I expected.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.395
Is there at least
some pudding in the fridge?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.764
- I ate it.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.301
- No. Uh...
Millicent and your mom

14:28.401 --> 14:30.337
can just go bake you
a whole new cake.

14:30.437 --> 14:34.107
- Once again, the women
take on the emotional labor.

14:34.207 --> 14:38.611
- You go make a cake
for your son.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.014
- Huh.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.385
- Uh, now...
everybody dance

14:45.485 --> 14:50.290
to this awesome playlist
that Pearl obviously made.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.493
* *

14:53.593 --> 14:55.295
I said everybody!

14:55.395 --> 14:58.165
* *

15:00.200 --> 15:02.502
- We're gonna die alone.
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.139
* *

15:07.840 --> 15:10.077
- That's too many eggs.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.245
- Uh-huh.
(dolphin sound effect)

15:12.345 --> 15:15.448
- You know, I flushed
your fish Donut down the toilet.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.985
- Uh-huh.
- Ugh.

15:19.519 --> 15:23.056
- Will you stop
flipping with Derek?

15:23.156 --> 15:26.393
- Grandma, I pray that
one day you find someone

15:26.493 --> 15:28.228
as kind and dope as Derek,

15:28.328 --> 15:31.231
but until then,
you just don't understand.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.400
- Oh. I understand
that you are going

15:33.500 --> 15:35.902
to put that phone down
and help me bake.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.504
(dolphin sound effect)

15:37.604 --> 15:40.373
(sighs) Millicent,
do not flip that flipper.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.475
Don't you flip.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.577
(dolphin sound effect)

15:44.677 --> 15:45.945
- Ugh!

15:46.046 --> 15:47.480
- Look, I'm sorry
if I'm focused

15:47.580 --> 15:50.350
on the best thing
in my life that will ever be

15:50.450 --> 15:53.886
and not some dumb cake
with way too many eggs in it.

15:53.987 --> 15:59.126
But Derek's going to flip me
back right... now.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.294
Now.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.896
(growls):
Now.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.035
- It's cold in the shade,
isn't it?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.837
* *

16:12.539 --> 16:14.307
- Hey!

16:14.407 --> 16:15.842
Hey!

16:15.942 --> 16:17.677
I never led
a conga line before.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.979
I can lead y'all
anywhere I wanna go.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.182
I am mad with power!

16:22.282 --> 16:24.417
- Where are Millicent
and Mrs. B with that cake?

16:24.517 --> 16:25.918
There's no way
we're gonna make it

16:26.019 --> 16:27.387
out of here
in time for our dates.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.356
- I think we're gonna
have to cancel.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.225
Let me just make sure my message
is appropriately delicate

16:32.325 --> 16:34.194
and respectful
of their feelings.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.097
- Same.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.800
- And...
- Sent.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.102
(phones chiming)

16:42.202 --> 16:44.071
Wow. What a coincidence.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.273
- Wait, no.
Dear God, no.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.840
Don't tell me
your name on the app is--

16:47.940 --> 16:49.676
BOTH: Gulliver Diphthong!

16:49.776 --> 16:52.011
- Wow, another coinci-- Oh!

16:52.112 --> 16:53.513
That means your name
on the app is--

16:53.613 --> 16:55.515
BOTH: Virginia Salisbury.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.219
- You're not ranked third
in the state in women's parkour.

16:59.319 --> 17:03.056
- And you don't "occasionally"
sing backup for Anita Baker.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.957
She is retired.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.895
* *

17:14.567 --> 17:18.671
- Beep!

17:19.139 --> 17:20.740
You know what that is, Pearl?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.342
Party just flatlined.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.211
'Cause we killed it!
- (chuckles)

17:24.311 --> 17:26.846
Carly, I almost ruined
my boyfriend's birthday.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.948
I didn't kill it.
You did.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.518
- None of that matters.
I mean, look at Freddie.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.953
* *

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
- This whole night was
about showing

17:36.156 --> 17:37.257
how well I know
my boyfriend,

17:37.357 --> 17:39.326
except it wasn't,
'cause I don't.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.162
You knew he liked
all this stuff, not me.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.031
You probably even knew
he wouldn't like the crow dip.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.500
- No one could have
predicted that.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.936
- Carly, this is your party.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.704
I mean, I'm even wearing
your clothes.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.674
I just... I-I need some air.
Will you cover for me?

17:54.774 --> 17:58.145
- No, you can't leave.
You can have those clothes.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.779
They're yours.
Maybe I can borrow them

17:59.879 --> 18:01.314
sometime,
I love your style.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.082
No.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.418
Consider this
my Irish Goodbye.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.620
(with Irish accent):
Fare thee well.

18:08.521 --> 18:12.359
Wait, that's not
even how that works.

18:12.459 --> 18:16.529
- (hums) Carly, this party
is so fun.

18:16.629 --> 18:20.700
- Yeah. Pearl nailed it.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.002
She knows you, dude.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.738
She... knows... you...

18:25.838 --> 18:27.640
so... well...

18:27.740 --> 18:31.944
inside...
and... out.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.148
- Are you buffering?
What's happening?

18:35.248 --> 18:38.285
Where's Pearl?
Did she leave?

18:38.385 --> 18:40.086
That would ruin everything.
Don't tell me she left.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.523
- I will not tell you that.
(giggles nervously)

18:43.623 --> 18:45.892
- So where is she?

18:45.992 --> 18:48.995
- Technically, she is gone.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.964
That I will tell you.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.833
- Uh...
- But...

18:53.933 --> 18:56.336
only because
we're shifting

18:56.436 --> 19:00.039
to the second phase
of your mystery party:

19:00.139 --> 19:03.910
Case of the missing Pearl.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.513
* Dun, dun, dun! *

19:06.613 --> 19:08.080
* *

19:13.353 --> 19:15.855
- That's right,
Detective Bellbottoms.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.358
There's a missing Pearl
and it's up to you...

19:18.458 --> 19:20.560
and all of us
to find her.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.529
- You didn't invent
the rumba.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.497
- Your uncle
is not Don Cheadle!

19:24.597 --> 19:26.098
- You've never been knighted!

19:26.199 --> 19:29.402
- You don't play harmonica
in a grindcore band!

19:30.537 --> 19:33.240
- So is this mystery
a part of the other one or...?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.708
I just need to know if I still
have a murdered brother.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.710
Am I in mourning
when I look for Pearl?

19:37.810 --> 19:40.513
- Everything's connected.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.716
Hmm, I wonder where she went...
and why.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.253
Actually, don't wonder why.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.954
Just find her.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.422
Uh, maybe she's behind
the kitchen counter

19:49.522 --> 19:51.558
or under the coffee table.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.460
- Well, I can see
from where we're standing

19:53.560 --> 19:55.862
she's not
under the coffee table.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.397
You know, this is
starting to feel

19:57.497 --> 19:59.065
a lot more like hide-and-seek
than a real mystery.

19:59.165 --> 20:02.869
- No. There are clues
everywhere. Everywhere.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.805
- Ooh, okay.
I get it.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.208
This is fun.
Uh, the crows.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.444
I knew they weren't
completely pointless.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.713
Crows are birds.
- Yes.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.215
- And birds like to fly...

20:16.316 --> 20:17.884
- You are burning hot.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.487
- ...into the studio
where Spencer

20:20.587 --> 20:22.188
always leaves
the window open.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.524
- I'm trying to see if I can
spot Frasier's apartment.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.192
- It is all connected.
(laughs)

20:26.293 --> 20:29.195
- To the studio.
We'll go how the crow flies.

20:29.296 --> 20:32.299
I am having
the time of my life!

20:33.199 --> 20:37.370
- How does that guy have
a girlfriend and we don't?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.306
* *

20:39.406 --> 20:41.674
- You get flipped,
and you flip back.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.242
It's a simple concept.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.413
Is our society
completely falling apart?

20:46.513 --> 20:51.318
- Can your grandma give
you a little bit of advice?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.619
- Sure.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.253
- You can't let
your relationship

20:54.354 --> 20:55.888
become your whole life.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.624
Take Lewbert and me.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.226
Ah, Lewbie.
The one that got away,

21:00.327 --> 21:03.896
came back, seduced me
while trying to defraud Carly

21:03.996 --> 21:07.099
of millions,
then got away again.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.569
- You're losing
the thread, Granny.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.438
- You have to remember,

21:11.538 --> 21:15.908
your happiness or sadness
is only owned by you.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.044
- Thanks, Grandma B.
You're old.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.813
- (gasps)
- But you say cool stuff.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.482
(dolphin sound effect)

21:22.582 --> 21:24.116
It's Derek!

21:24.216 --> 21:26.586
Aww, he says sorry,
he was helping his grandpa

21:26.686 --> 21:29.356
open a jar of peanut butter.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.925
(sighs) To be a fly on the wall
for that gun show.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.395
I have to write him back.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.498
(timer dings)
- Oh.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.334
Eh, he can wait till after
we frost the cake.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.403
Let him sweat it out
a little bit.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.138
Oh, my gosh.
He just started using deodorant,

21:46.238 --> 21:47.807
and it's lovely.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.812
- (sighs, sniffs)

21:52.912 --> 21:55.081
- It seems more
like a frittata.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.649
- Do we have time
to bake another?

21:56.749 --> 22:00.420
- Sure we have the time...
but do we have the desire?

22:03.022 --> 22:04.957
- I missed us.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.960
* *

22:08.060 --> 22:10.763
- She's not anywhere.
She's not in the studio.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.632
She's not under Spencer's bed.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.401
Or in that weird cage above it.

22:15.602 --> 22:19.038
- Fine. She left.
I'm sorry, Freddie.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.607
- How could
you let her leave?

22:20.707 --> 22:25.044
- Oh, so now Pearl being here
is my responsibility too?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.979
You know,
I can't do everything.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.548
- What are you talking about?

22:28.648 --> 22:33.052
- Pearl wanted to throw you
a wet crow party,

22:33.152 --> 22:35.522
and I've been bending
over backwards all night

22:35.622 --> 22:39.058
to try to give you a birthday
you might actually like.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.694
- (sighs)
- Yeah.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.362
I think
that crow just moved.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.566
- You know, a real one could've
flown in here at any time.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.768
We would never know.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.204
- Look, Freddie, I knew
you weren't gonna like

22:52.304 --> 22:56.142
what Pearl had planned
so I just took over.

22:56.242 --> 22:59.011
All I wanted to do
was make you happy.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.614
- I appreciate that, Carly,
but it's not fair.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.184
Pearl is never going to know me
as well as you do.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.090
Oh, Pearl,
I'm sorry. I--

23:11.190 --> 23:13.726
- No, no. It's okay, Freddie.
You're right.

23:13.826 --> 23:17.096
I'm never going to know you
as well as Carly does,

23:17.196 --> 23:20.467
because you and Carly are
clearly in love with each other.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.908
BOTH:
* Happy birthday to you *

23:29.008 --> 23:30.276
MILLICENT: Cha, cha, cha.

23:30.376 --> 23:33.145
BOTH:
* Happy birthday to you *

23:33.245 --> 23:34.747
MILLICENT: Cha, cha, cha.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.618
BOTH: * Happy birthday,
dear Freddie *

23:38.718 --> 23:42.421
MILLICENT:
* Happy birthday to you *

23:44.090 --> 23:46.826
Cha, cha, cha?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.294
* *

23:54.033 --> 23:56.068
* *

24:15.922 --> 24:17.624
Ooh!

24:17.724 --> 24:19.926
MAN:
He hates these cans.
