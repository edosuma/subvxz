WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:09.241
The history of Irish cops
in New York goes back 150 years.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.287
The statue we're dedicating

00:11.288 --> 00:13.796
commemorates the Irish-American
immigration history

00:13.797 --> 00:17.733
as told through 150 years
of Irish men and women

00:17.736 --> 00:19.302
serving across the ranks

00:19.304 --> 00:21.270
of the NYPD.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.872
And up the ranks.

00:22.874 --> 00:26.075
Thank you for that,
Madam President.

00:26.077 --> 00:27.210
MAN:
And because that history

00:27.212 --> 00:28.911
is also tied
to the DA's office,

00:28.913 --> 00:30.046
uh, we'd welcome

00:30.048 --> 00:32.982
your representatives
at the ceremony itself.

00:32.984 --> 00:34.684
While the district attorney
could not attend today,

00:34.686 --> 00:36.919
he's assured me that he will
be attending the ceremony.

00:36.921 --> 00:38.354
For clearance purposes,

00:38.356 --> 00:40.723
we'll need a rundown
of the attendees from your side

00:40.725 --> 00:41.991
who will be at the unveiling.

00:41.993 --> 00:44.027
Fair enough. I'll get that
to you this afternoon.

00:44.029 --> 00:48.131
Well, President Sullivan,
Chief Farrelly,

00:48.133 --> 00:49.699
it's a lovely gesture.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.134
Gonna be a great day.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.635
Thank you.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.640
Lovely to meet you, Erin.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.909
It's nice to meet you.
I'll see you at the ceremony.

00:59.911 --> 01:01.477
You bet.

01:05.183 --> 01:07.850
FRANK: And how long are you
going to be in New York?

01:09.621 --> 01:10.920
Erin.

01:10.922 --> 01:12.755
Chief Farrelly.

01:12.757 --> 01:14.190
Uh, I have a favor.

01:15.093 --> 01:16.959
My father was murdered here

01:16.961 --> 01:19.295
in New York City back in 1974.

01:19.297 --> 01:21.431
I'm so sorry.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.299
Now, we immediately moved back
to Ireland after that,

01:23.301 --> 01:25.568
but I was just wondering

01:25.570 --> 01:28.204
any chance you could give me
what you have on his case?

01:28.206 --> 01:30.073
Sure, I'll look into it for you.

01:32.243 --> 01:33.342
Thanks.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.778
Sure.

01:35.780 --> 01:37.714
SULLIVAN: ... and then
heading to Washington

01:37.716 --> 01:39.382
where I'm meeting
with the president

01:39.384 --> 01:40.883
Friday afternoon.

01:40.885 --> 01:42.485
Oh, well, anything
I can do to help

01:42.487 --> 01:44.120
before you head down
to Washington,

01:44.122 --> 01:45.354
please don't hesitate.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.056
GARRETT: Excuse me,
Madam President,

01:47.058 --> 01:50.193
I need the commissioner,
if you'll excuse us.

01:50.195 --> 01:51.394
Sorry.
Mm.

01:51.396 --> 01:54.097
Again, thanks.

01:57.102 --> 01:59.335
We just got a call from
the Nassau County Commissioner.

01:59.337 --> 02:01.704
The FBI is in Little Neck Bay

02:01.706 --> 02:03.372
conducting
a homicide investigation.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.476
Word is there may be
multiple victims dumped there.

02:06.478 --> 02:08.978
(sighs)
And?

02:08.979 --> 02:10.012
The initial forensics point

02:10.014 --> 02:12.849
to our serial killer,
Thomas Wilder.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.053
(sighs)

02:24.529 --> 02:25.962
Hey, do you believe
in soul mates?

02:25.964 --> 02:27.864
What do you mean?

02:27.866 --> 02:30.266
The notion that...

02:30.268 --> 02:33.703
there's only
one person for everyone.

02:33.705 --> 02:35.271
Yeah, I guess so, why?

02:35.273 --> 02:37.173
Because I read an article
that said that statistically

02:37.175 --> 02:39.642
there's only
one-and-a-half-billion chance

02:39.644 --> 02:41.811
that you'll ever actually
meet that person.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.146
I think you're over thinking it.

02:43.148 --> 02:44.914
DISPATCH:
15 Edward, be advised

02:44.916 --> 02:47.116
we have a white male
armed with a machete

02:47.118 --> 02:49.485
at 512 East End Avenue.

02:49.487 --> 02:51.754
There is a woman slashed
at that location.

02:51.756 --> 02:53.022
Any units on the back?

02:53.024 --> 02:55.091
Central, this is 12 David.
We're on the back.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.759
(siren wails)

02:56.761 --> 02:58.361
Sir, you don't want to do this!

02:58.363 --> 03:00.096
Stand back!
(overlapping shouting)

03:00.098 --> 03:01.664
Drop the knife, sir.

03:01.666 --> 03:02.665
Get back!
Get the hell back!

03:02.667 --> 03:04.133
(panting):
Drop the knife!

03:04.135 --> 03:05.334
No, take it easy, all right?

03:05.336 --> 03:07.170
Take it easy!
Drop it!

03:07.172 --> 03:08.237
Right there, stop!

03:08.239 --> 03:09.172
(sobs)

03:09.174 --> 03:10.773
(sirens chirp)

03:10.775 --> 03:12.575
Get up. Get up. Come on.

03:12.577 --> 03:14.310
Get back as far
as you can.

03:14.312 --> 03:15.812
(indistinct shouting)

03:15.814 --> 03:16.913
Hey, take it easy.
Why don't you just tell us

03:16.915 --> 03:18.114
what's up here, buddy.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.849
She took my kid, man.
She's trying to take my kid.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.584
That's my son!
WOMAN: You'll never see him again!

03:21.586 --> 03:22.385
(sobbing)

03:22.387 --> 03:23.386
Get her out of here!
Shut up!

03:23.388 --> 03:24.854
Hey, no one's doing
anything right now.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.389
You hear me?
No one's doing anything.

03:26.391 --> 03:27.857
All right?
You hear me?

03:29.460 --> 03:30.960
(panting)

03:30.962 --> 03:33.529
I got this.
Everyone just back up.

03:33.531 --> 03:35.398
JANKO: Let's give
him some space.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.499
Let's step back, let's go.

03:36.501 --> 03:37.600
Hey.
Everyone get back.

03:37.602 --> 03:38.668
Get back.
Don't look at them.

03:38.670 --> 03:40.603
Look at me.

03:40.605 --> 03:44.774
You don't drop it right now,
this isn't gonna end well, okay?

03:44.776 --> 03:46.209
Everyone's scared here,
everyone's jumpy.

03:46.211 --> 03:48.144
You don't put
the knife down right now,

03:48.146 --> 03:49.679
I'm afraid
what's gonna happen to you.

03:49.681 --> 03:51.514
(crying):
She took my kids, man.

03:51.516 --> 03:52.748
JAMIE:
Okay.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.283
She took my son.

03:54.285 --> 03:55.651
I hear you, but she's not dead.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.286
You didn't kill anyone.
Eddie, asp.

03:57.288 --> 03:58.928
We don't want to hurt you,
you understand?

04:00.091 --> 04:01.157
We don't want to kill you.

04:01.159 --> 04:02.592
(crying):
She took my kid, I don't know.

04:02.594 --> 04:04.794
JAMIE: I'm your friend here,
I'm being your friend here.

04:04.796 --> 04:06.128
I don't know.
I'm listening.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.430
(grunts)
(screams)

04:07.432 --> 04:10.099
(grunting)

04:10.101 --> 04:11.601
(loud grunt)

04:13.271 --> 04:15.271
(Jaime panting)

04:15.273 --> 04:17.206
You all right?
(panting): Oh, yeah.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.608
You're okay.

04:19.611 --> 04:22.545
(panting)
All right.

04:22.547 --> 04:27.116
(distant sirens,
indistinct radio chatter)

04:28.019 --> 04:30.086
Hey, you can't go in there.

04:30.088 --> 04:31.120
The hell I can't.

04:31.122 --> 04:32.488
NYPD.

04:32.490 --> 04:34.557
AGENT: Nassau County,
it's not your place.

04:34.559 --> 04:36.592
Yeah, but it's my case.

04:36.594 --> 04:37.960
You're Danny Reagan.

04:37.962 --> 04:39.095
Who the hell are you?

04:39.097 --> 04:41.697
Adam Parker,
FBI behavioral analyst.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.165
Oh, you're a
behavioral analyst?

04:43.167 --> 04:45.902
Okay, well then you should
realize that I'm pissed off.

04:45.904 --> 04:48.304
Why the hell didn't you tell me
you found another body?

04:48.306 --> 04:49.372
We're not sure

04:49.374 --> 04:50.439
if it involves him yet.

04:50.441 --> 04:52.041
But you did find another body.
Yes.

04:52.043 --> 04:53.242
You can say that.

GARRETT:
<i>Did you ever hear</i>

06:31.619 --> 06:33.853
of the four by four
breathing technique?

06:33.855 --> 06:37.790
You inhale for four seconds,
hold it for four seconds,

06:37.792 --> 06:39.625
and then let it out
for four seconds.

06:39.627 --> 06:41.861
It's supposed
to be very calming.

06:43.631 --> 06:44.730
For some people.

06:44.732 --> 06:46.265
(door opens)

06:46.267 --> 06:49.635
Alexander Clune,
Special Agent in Charge.

06:49.637 --> 06:50.770
Afternoon, gentlemen.

06:50.772 --> 06:52.071
Thank you for coming.

06:52.073 --> 06:54.006
I'm DCPI Moore, this is...

06:54.008 --> 06:57.143
You're conducting a homicide
investigation in my city

06:57.145 --> 06:58.577
without informing me.

06:58.579 --> 07:01.180
Well, the bodies
that we uncovered

07:01.182 --> 07:03.415
were over the border
in Nassau County.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.151
And what's that support?
That Thomas Wilder buried

07:05.153 --> 07:07.086
his victims
a couple of miles out

07:07.088 --> 07:09.255
so you wouldn't
have to inform us?

07:09.257 --> 07:10.589
There are rules
governing jurisdiction

07:10.591 --> 07:12.324
that dictate procedure.

07:12.326 --> 07:13.526
Well, here's your procedure:

07:13.528 --> 07:16.862
Thomas Wilder is wanted
for murders in this city,

07:16.864 --> 07:19.532
in cases still open
<i>in</i> this city.

07:19.534 --> 07:21.867
We got a tip. We weren't even
sure that it was credible.

07:21.869 --> 07:24.770
That led to a dozen bodies, that
sounds pretty credible to me.

07:24.772 --> 07:26.505
You know, Commissioner,
we're not done analyzing,

07:26.507 --> 07:29.275
but when we find something,
you will be the first to know.

07:29.277 --> 07:30.676
It is already been established

07:30.678 --> 07:33.879
that I will not be the first
to know or even the fourth.

07:33.881 --> 07:36.148
There's more than one
jurisdiction involved in this.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.449
We're talking
about a serial killer

07:37.451 --> 07:40.252
who's murdered
in four states that we know of.

07:40.254 --> 07:42.588
Now, we are more experienced
in this area.

07:42.590 --> 07:45.090
And we are more experienced
in this area.

07:45.092 --> 07:47.760
Sounds to me like we are
in agreement here.

07:47.762 --> 07:50.629
We'll make
a joint investigation.

07:50.631 --> 07:51.730
(chuckle)

07:51.732 --> 07:54.200
Fellas, I don't take
orders from you.

07:54.202 --> 07:56.535
It's not an order,
it's a valuable suggestion.

07:56.537 --> 07:58.871
Right.

07:58.873 --> 08:02.374
Or I could suggest it
right over your head.

08:05.913 --> 08:06.979
We can coordinate something.

08:06.981 --> 08:09.548
We will coordinate everything.

08:16.424 --> 08:17.523
That went well.

08:17.525 --> 08:19.692
(sighs)

08:26.767 --> 08:29.535
All right, let me know
what you hear.

08:29.537 --> 08:30.636
PARKER: Detective Reagan.

08:30.638 --> 08:32.037
I guess we're
working together now.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.739
I already got a partner.

08:33.741 --> 08:36.041
I don't think
you understand.

08:36.043 --> 08:37.610
Two bodies in Jersey,

08:37.611 --> 08:38.777
three in Virginia,

08:38.779 --> 08:43.148
and one unconfirmed
in Pennsylvania.

08:43.150 --> 08:44.550
How many does that make?

08:44.552 --> 08:46.252
We're looking
at about 22 victims.

08:46.254 --> 08:47.953
Initial examination

08:47.955 --> 08:50.356
on the bodies we found
this morning

08:50.358 --> 08:52.691
indicate that they
are not recent.

08:52.693 --> 08:54.827
Well, that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

08:54.829 --> 08:57.029
But we think that
he's back in New York.

08:57.031 --> 08:59.431
Our last sighting,

08:59.433 --> 09:02.334
he took a train into
Penn Station two weeks ago.

09:02.336 --> 09:04.670
Good, make it much easier
for me to find him.

09:04.672 --> 09:05.738
(chuckles)

09:05.740 --> 09:07.673
You're a type A personality.

09:07.675 --> 09:10.843
Obsessive compulsive,
extrovert,

09:10.845 --> 09:12.845
intuitive, judger.

09:12.847 --> 09:14.513
You had me at type A.

09:14.515 --> 09:18.017
I'm guessing you're thinking
that a behavioral analyst

09:18.019 --> 09:19.551
should be sitting
in a lab somewhere,

09:19.553 --> 09:21.186
not working a case
in New York City.

09:21.188 --> 09:23.322
Well, you said that, not me.

09:23.324 --> 09:26.425
Well, I've worked a dozen serial
killer cases in my career.

09:26.427 --> 09:27.960
Must be tough to do when
you're sitting behind a desk.

09:27.962 --> 09:30.429
And I've solved a few.
How about you?

09:31.198 --> 09:34.266
Well, the only one
that matters...

09:34.268 --> 09:35.935
is this one.

09:39.507 --> 09:43.842
Patrick Farrelly got into
a gunfight on July 2, 1974

09:43.844 --> 09:45.644
with a James McGee.

09:45.646 --> 09:46.946
Head of the Westies?

09:46.948 --> 09:50.549
Yeah, turf war in Hell's Kitchen
back in the bad old days

09:50.551 --> 09:52.284
when Hell's Kitchen
was tenements and bars.

09:52.286 --> 09:56.522
McGee shot Farrelly outside
of a bar on 41st and Amsterdam.

09:56.524 --> 09:59.858
Farrelly returned fire,
they both got arrested.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.895
Both charged
with attempted murder.

10:02.897 --> 10:04.029
<i>Attempted</i> murder?

10:04.031 --> 10:07.266
Yeah, Farrelly took
four bullets...

10:07.268 --> 10:09.101
and survived.

10:10.471 --> 10:11.770
Wait, he's still alive?

10:11.772 --> 10:13.072
He's alive and kicking.

10:13.074 --> 10:14.540
He was convicted
of racketeering

10:14.542 --> 10:16.208
and three counts of murder,

10:16.210 --> 10:18.110
and he's doing life
in Sing Sing.

10:19.013 --> 10:22.014
Okay, well, this is...

10:22.016 --> 10:23.916
not at all what I expected.

10:23.918 --> 10:25.384
You probably shouldn't
have volunteered

10:25.386 --> 10:26.652
to look into it for him.

10:26.654 --> 10:27.686
Thanks for rubbing it in.

10:27.688 --> 10:29.121
I'm just saying.

10:29.123 --> 10:31.290
What am I supposed to say?

10:31.292 --> 10:32.758
That your mother's been
lying to you

10:32.760 --> 10:35.594
your entire life
and your father's a gangster?

10:35.596 --> 10:36.562
No, you don't.

10:36.564 --> 10:38.263
You wait for him to go
back to Ireland

10:38.265 --> 10:39.598
and then you send him an e-mail.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.899
I can't do that.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.501
Why not?
If your father was a gangster,

10:42.503 --> 10:44.803
would you want to find out
by e-mail?

10:44.805 --> 10:47.740
My father was a gangster
and I found out when I was 13.

10:47.742 --> 10:49.742
Your father's a gangster?

10:49.744 --> 10:52.911
Well, a bookie.
Tony "The Bat."

10:52.913 --> 10:55.614
And guess what he liked to use
on people who didn't pay up.

10:55.616 --> 10:56.648
(sighs)

10:56.650 --> 11:00.085
Anyway, the point is that
I got over it,

11:00.087 --> 11:01.720
and I even became a cop,

11:01.722 --> 11:05.057
but-but we don't know how
this guy is gonna react to that,

11:05.059 --> 11:08.360
and the fact that his dad
is still alive?

11:08.362 --> 11:09.928
I say we don't find out.

11:11.732 --> 11:13.198
No, I-I...

11:13.200 --> 11:14.867
I have to tell him to his face.

11:14.869 --> 11:16.502
Of course you do.

11:16.504 --> 11:18.170
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

11:18.172 --> 11:21.073
It means,
as Tony "The Bat" would say,

11:21.075 --> 11:23.542
you always step up to the plate.

11:32.019 --> 11:34.453
(sighs)

11:37.191 --> 11:38.924
The guy was hopped
up on something.

11:38.926 --> 11:41.693
He was insane,
so he had this huge knife.

11:41.695 --> 11:43.162
As soon as I got to the scene,

11:43.164 --> 11:44.797
I thought,
this guy's a dead man.

11:44.799 --> 11:47.166
But your uncle...

11:47.168 --> 11:49.802
took him down
with no injuries.

11:49.804 --> 11:52.771
Yeah, Uncle Jaime's always been
the one with the most patience.

11:52.773 --> 11:55.040
Watching him...

11:55.042 --> 11:57.676
I was just pumped.

11:57.678 --> 11:58.844
Then what?

11:58.846 --> 12:00.813
Oh, when it was all over,
we introduced ourselves.

12:00.815 --> 12:02.114
I told him about us.

12:02.116 --> 12:03.282
Wait, what?

12:04.618 --> 12:06.118
You told him we're going out?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.053
Well, I tried to dodge,
but he guessed.

12:08.055 --> 12:09.321
Please tell me you're kidding.

12:09.323 --> 12:10.422
Did you want me to lie?

12:10.424 --> 12:13.892
I wanted you not
to volunteer anything.

12:13.894 --> 12:15.727
Why, are you embarrassed of me
or something?

12:15.729 --> 12:18.864
Okay, it's just...

12:18.866 --> 12:20.799
they're totally overprotective.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.205
You don't know my family.

12:29.477 --> 12:31.977
He's in an escalation period.

12:31.979 --> 12:33.312
He's not only
killed more women,

12:33.314 --> 12:36.248
but the cooling off period
has shortened.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.083
And I think he's
up to something bigger.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.251
Yeah, but what?

12:39.253 --> 12:41.053
I think he wants
a bigger stage.

12:41.055 --> 12:42.821
DOCTOR: Reagan.
Hey, Doc.

12:42.823 --> 12:43.822
Thanks for coming down.

12:43.824 --> 12:44.923
Do you know how many cops

12:44.925 --> 12:46.158
I actually come down
to the precinct to see?

12:46.160 --> 12:47.159
If it was any more than
me, I'd be jealous.

12:47.161 --> 12:48.327
What do you got?

12:48.329 --> 12:49.962
Hopefully now you can
stop calling my cell phone

12:49.964 --> 12:51.196
every five minutes.

12:51.198 --> 12:52.531
Were you able to I.D.
the bone fragments

12:52.533 --> 12:53.632
from the boat explosion?

12:53.634 --> 12:55.634
The remains belong
to Wilder's mother.

12:57.071 --> 12:59.438
That sick son of a bitch
blows up his own mother.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.939
I think that'd be obvious.

13:00.941 --> 13:03.242
He did it because he thought
she cooperated with you.

13:03.244 --> 13:06.812
No, what's obvious is that
he's a complete maniac.

13:06.814 --> 13:08.147
You got anything
on the other bodies?

13:08.149 --> 13:09.248
I conferred

13:09.250 --> 13:10.516
with the Nassau County
Medical Examiner,

13:10.518 --> 13:11.850
and the victims are
all consistent

13:11.852 --> 13:13.051
with Thomas Wilder's pattern.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.420
Blunt force trauma,
manual strangulation,

13:15.422 --> 13:17.089
sex postmortem, posed.

13:17.091 --> 13:18.290
Any I.D.s yet?

13:18.292 --> 13:19.525
They're running
dental records now.

13:19.527 --> 13:21.560
Thanks for coming down, Doc.

13:21.562 --> 13:24.129
The call from the tip line
about the location of the bodies

13:24.131 --> 13:27.833
was made from a throwaway phone
purchased at Tech Jungle

13:27.835 --> 13:29.234
on 48th and Columbus.

13:29.236 --> 13:31.970
They got to have surveillance
cameras down there, come on.

13:34.808 --> 13:37.176
She's the only girl,
she's the first grandchild.

13:37.178 --> 13:38.877
I think we're just
trying to make sure...

13:38.879 --> 13:39.945
That she doesn't grow up.

13:39.947 --> 13:41.914
That she's making
the right choices.

13:41.916 --> 13:44.316
And dating a cop is
<i>not</i> the right choice?

13:44.318 --> 13:45.350
No.

13:45.352 --> 13:47.186
Maybe it is. I don't know.
(chuckles)

13:47.188 --> 13:48.787
Well, cops are hot.

13:48.789 --> 13:49.821
(groans)
And he seemed

13:49.823 --> 13:51.423
like a very nice guy to me.

13:51.425 --> 13:52.457
He better be.

13:52.459 --> 13:53.559
See? There you go again.

13:53.561 --> 13:55.594
How old is Nicky?
19.

13:57.398 --> 13:58.931
Please let me put this
into perspective.

13:58.933 --> 14:02.134
At 19, I dated
over a half-a-dozen guys.

14:02.136 --> 14:05.737
There was a drummer, there was a
camp counselor with a six-pack--

14:05.739 --> 14:07.606
beer, not abs--

14:07.608 --> 14:09.174
a baseball jock.

14:09.176 --> 14:11.910
He had the homerun record.

14:11.912 --> 14:13.011
Enough said there.

14:13.013 --> 14:15.480
And literally the guy
who lived next door to me.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.149
The point is,

14:17.151 --> 14:21.153
dating a guy is very normal
for a young woman, okay?

14:21.155 --> 14:22.120
We're not crazy.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.488
Yeah, you are.

14:28.729 --> 14:30.896
Punch in a little closer.

14:30.898 --> 14:32.331
Little more.

14:34.902 --> 14:36.034
That's him.

14:36.036 --> 14:37.903
Yup, he paid cash,
and the phone was inactive

14:37.905 --> 14:39.571
ever since the tip came in.
(phone ringing)

14:39.573 --> 14:40.572
Reagan.

14:40.574 --> 14:41.740
Hello, Detective.

14:41.742 --> 14:43.442
Wilder.

14:43.444 --> 14:44.910
Run a trace on this.

14:44.912 --> 14:47.346
You've been busy
trying to find me.

14:47.348 --> 14:49.781
Let me tell you something,

14:49.783 --> 14:51.483
I am gonna find you.

14:51.485 --> 14:53.518
You've had months
to find me, Detective.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.854
And because
of your ineffectiveness,

14:55.856 --> 14:57.990
unfortunately,
now someone else has to die.

14:57.992 --> 15:00.058
What do you say me and you get
together, have a little talk.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.561
Just you and I.
You insult me.

15:02.563 --> 15:03.829
Wilder, listen to me.

15:03.831 --> 15:05.197
Please hold.

15:05.199 --> 15:05.964
Wilder.

15:05.966 --> 15:07.399
Hi.

15:07.401 --> 15:08.900
Hi.

15:08.902 --> 15:10.302
Um, I'm just wondering,

15:10.304 --> 15:11.703
is that a Pomeranian?

15:11.705 --> 15:12.871
WOMAN: Uh, yeah, it is.

15:12.873 --> 15:14.239
WILDER:
She's so cute.

15:14.241 --> 15:15.674
WOMAN:
Thank you.

15:15.676 --> 15:16.808
WILDER: I've been thinking
about getting one.

15:16.810 --> 15:18.910
Hear they're super smart
and affectionate.

15:18.912 --> 15:21.580
Leave that girl alone.
Hey, get back on the phone!

15:21.582 --> 15:23.081
Oh yeah, um, they're great.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.218
And she just loves people.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.919
Would you like to hold her?

15:27.921 --> 15:29.788
Oh, if I may.
Yeah.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.123
Wilder, don't do this.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.658
Listen, I got to run.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.826
Wilder! Hey! Hello?

15:34.828 --> 15:36.528
(dial tone droning)
Hello!

15:36.530 --> 15:38.463
Did you get anything?

15:54.862 --> 15:56.888
PARKER: Every time he calls
here to talk to you,

15:56.988 --> 15:59.088
he puts himself at greater risk

15:59.090 --> 16:00.890
of being caught.

16:00.892 --> 16:02.024
(quietly):
Right.

16:02.426 --> 16:04.860
He wants to please you.
So?

16:04.862 --> 16:06.161
So let him.

16:06.163 --> 16:07.563
You got a whole unit

16:07.565 --> 16:09.798
dedicated to analyzing

16:09.800 --> 16:12.901
and studying and figuring out
maniacs like him.

16:12.903 --> 16:16.105
Animals who hunt and kill people
just for pleasure,

16:16.107 --> 16:17.739
and the best you
can come up with

16:17.741 --> 16:19.575
is that he wants to please me?

16:19.577 --> 16:22.511
You ever hear of Edmund Kemper,
the Co-Ed Killer?

16:22.513 --> 16:24.613
(sighs) Sure, why?

16:24.615 --> 16:26.682
He killed his mother,
and shortly after that,

16:26.684 --> 16:27.883
he turned himself in.

16:27.885 --> 16:31.987
He said that killing her
allowed him to surrender.

16:34.225 --> 16:36.592
Oh.

16:36.594 --> 16:37.559
I get it now.

16:37.561 --> 16:41.330
You think
he's gonna turn himself in.

16:41.332 --> 16:42.731
He may have.

16:42.733 --> 16:47.035
But now his actions have become
more erratic, more intensified

16:47.037 --> 16:48.937
since he killed his mother
on that boat.

16:48.939 --> 16:51.540
Good, 'cause I don't want him
to stain his routine.

16:51.542 --> 16:52.608
Well, I do, okay?

16:52.610 --> 16:54.977
Because that is how
we catch these guys.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.578
22 people are dead.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.813
I'm not waiting for him anymore.

16:57.815 --> 16:59.648
Because you challenged him.

16:59.650 --> 17:03.519
Now, he's dropping bodies at
your feet like a damn retriever.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.587
He's doing that because
he's a serial killer.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.556
That's what they do--
They kill people.

17:07.558 --> 17:11.827
I wish you knew the first thing
about human behavior.

17:11.829 --> 17:15.464
And I wish you knew that
that son of a bitch isn't human!

17:16.834 --> 17:18.700
(sighs)
(phone ringing)

17:20.570 --> 17:23.939
Reagan.

17:28.946 --> 17:32.548
(quietly):
Okay. Yeah.

17:35.219 --> 17:37.052
They found another body.

17:38.656 --> 17:40.689
(sighs)

17:47.264 --> 17:49.731
GARRETT: The FBI issued
a press release

17:49.733 --> 17:53.302
with the latest victim's name--
Gabriella Moretti--

17:53.304 --> 17:55.304
without informing us.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.106
I've got a new name
for our joint investigations:

17:58.108 --> 17:59.341
disjointed.

17:59.343 --> 18:00.976
Special Agent Clune
is here, sir.

18:00.978 --> 18:02.144
Let's have him.

18:04.782 --> 18:05.981
I know what you're gonna say.

18:05.983 --> 18:07.482
No, I don't think you do.

18:07.484 --> 18:08.283
It was an oversight.

18:08.285 --> 18:09.952
Clearly, you have no oversight.

18:09.954 --> 18:11.119
What is that supposed to mean?

18:11.121 --> 18:13.589
That you're so anxious
to jump claim,

18:13.591 --> 18:14.923
you are issuing releases

18:14.925 --> 18:17.826
on a case in our jurisdiction,
and ahead of us.

18:17.828 --> 18:19.861
Our objective was to get
the information out

18:19.863 --> 18:21.263
as soon as possible.

18:21.265 --> 18:22.431
To warn citizens about the fact

18:22.433 --> 18:24.233
that a serial killer
is on the loose.

18:24.235 --> 18:25.667
Tell me something,

18:25.669 --> 18:28.337
did you notify the family first?

18:30.574 --> 18:32.307
I'm sure that we did.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.545
No, you're not.

18:36.547 --> 18:37.746
Look, in the midst of this,

18:37.748 --> 18:40.148
you want to talk about,
what, manners?

18:40.150 --> 18:42.451
This is NYPD headquarters,
Agent Clune.

18:42.453 --> 18:45.420
I do not need a tutorial
in communicating with my city.

18:45.422 --> 18:46.555
If I may.

18:46.557 --> 18:48.790
The only thing you may do
is share with me,

18:48.792 --> 18:51.260
right now, anything else
you haven't shared.

18:51.262 --> 18:53.262
DCPI Moore, are you gonna
do your job here,

18:53.264 --> 18:54.263
and ask your boss

18:54.265 --> 18:55.297
to back off?

18:55.299 --> 18:57.099
Not if I want to keep my job.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.468
I tell you what,
let me make it easy on you,

18:59.470 --> 19:01.103
let's just cancel the
joint investigation, how's that?

19:01.105 --> 19:02.738
That's not your call.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.172
Well, you didn't want to do it
in the first place,

19:04.174 --> 19:05.340
so it's a wash, right?

19:05.342 --> 19:06.742
You can't just do that.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.410
Oh, sure I can.

19:08.412 --> 19:10.679
Just call it
professional courtesy.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.981
Just between us men.

19:14.618 --> 19:16.685
What-what is this?

19:16.687 --> 19:18.654
Everybody walks away happy.

19:21.225 --> 19:25.394
Minute we have him,
I'll shoot you an e-mail.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.755
Hi, thanks for coming down.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.790
No, thank you, Erin.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.858
Please have a seat.

19:59.596 --> 20:01.496
So, I took a look
at your father's case.

20:01.498 --> 20:04.099
Turns out he was shot

20:04.101 --> 20:07.336
in a turf war over a
neighborhood that, at the time,

20:07.338 --> 20:08.470
was controlled by the mob.

20:08.472 --> 20:10.639
Hell's Kitchen.
Yes.

20:11.442 --> 20:13.642
He survived.

20:14.478 --> 20:16.511
Well, I don't understand.

20:16.513 --> 20:19.348
He was shot four times,
rushed to St. Vincent's,

20:19.350 --> 20:21.416
and he recovered.

20:21.418 --> 20:23.151
So he's not dead?

20:23.153 --> 20:25.354
He's in prison.

20:25.356 --> 20:28.423
(chuckles)
Well, that must be a mistake.

20:28.425 --> 20:31.326
He's been in prison for almost
40 years for attempted murder,

20:31.328 --> 20:32.828
murder and racketeering.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.463
Racketeering?

20:34.465 --> 20:36.631
Your father was the top
lieutenant in the Irish mob.

20:36.633 --> 20:40.802
My mother told me that he
was murdered in that shoot-out.

20:40.804 --> 20:44.906
Maybe she was trying
to protect you.

20:47.511 --> 20:48.777
The prison is upstate.

20:48.779 --> 20:50.412
I'm happy to arrange
for you to meet.

20:50.414 --> 20:53.081
No, no.

20:54.952 --> 20:56.618
I'm sorry.

20:56.620 --> 21:00.255
Well, uh, thank you
for looking into this, Erin

21:01.425 --> 21:03.058
I appreciate that.

21:16.874 --> 21:19.341
Got to be the same girl
from the phone call.

21:19.343 --> 21:20.842
You see what he's doing, right?

21:20.844 --> 21:23.178
He's trying
to get inside your head

21:23.180 --> 21:24.746
by sharing
this experience with you,

21:24.748 --> 21:25.914
but if we get inside

21:25.916 --> 21:28.350
his head,
it'll be easier to find him.

21:28.352 --> 21:30.619
You can waste your time
trying to get inside his head.

21:30.621 --> 21:33.321
The only way to find him
is to up the game.

21:33.323 --> 21:35.290
Detective Reagan.
I got nothing for you.

21:35.292 --> 21:37.125
I've got something for you.

21:37.127 --> 21:38.560
A message from Thomas Wilder.

21:39.863 --> 21:43.165
This came to the newsroom
to my attention.

21:43.167 --> 21:44.699
"Danny Reagan is not
a good detective.

21:44.701 --> 21:47.836
He can't even protect
helpless women."

21:51.408 --> 21:53.074
Now do you have a comment?

22:04.288 --> 22:06.636
HENRY: Remember how we
caught the Son of Sam, Francis?

22:06.735 --> 22:07.934
Parking ticket.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.886
Ted Bundy got caught
running a stop sign.

22:09.888 --> 22:11.154
Maybe that's how you get Wilder.

22:11.156 --> 22:13.456
Well, most criminals
are stupid, Jack.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.759
They make stupid mistakes.
Now Wilder, he's...

22:17.496 --> 22:21.665
You know, maybe we should
talk about something else.

22:23.001 --> 22:26.236
How about we talk about
Nicky's new cop boyfriend.

22:26.238 --> 22:27.804
LINDA:
Sean!

22:27.806 --> 22:28.738
That's what you said.

22:28.740 --> 22:29.739
NICKY:
It's fine.

22:29.741 --> 22:31.441
I know it's
the elephant in the room.

22:31.443 --> 22:32.942
Thank you for that, Uncle Jaime.

22:32.944 --> 22:34.010
Hey, it's no big deal.

22:34.012 --> 22:35.278
Apparently it is to you guys.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.013
Sure you've already
checked him out.

22:37.015 --> 22:38.281
Not me.

22:38.283 --> 22:39.916
Mom's already tried
to nonchalantly ask about him

22:39.918 --> 22:41.885
about five times.
I asked once.

22:41.887 --> 22:43.453
You're all freaked out,
which is pretty ironic,

22:43.455 --> 22:45.321
considering that
five out of the nine people

22:45.323 --> 22:47.323
around this dinner table
are in law enforcement.

22:47.325 --> 22:48.425
I'm not freaked out.

22:48.427 --> 22:50.160
I'm freaking out
just a little bit.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.194
(chuckles)
A cop.

22:51.196 --> 22:52.495
Really?

22:52.497 --> 22:53.797
What's wrong with dating a cop?

22:53.799 --> 22:55.699
Nothing, as long as you know
what you're getting into.

22:55.701 --> 22:56.900
You know, the constant worry.
Exactly.

22:56.902 --> 22:58.468
Crazy hours.
The high pressure.

22:58.470 --> 23:00.136
The mental, physical toll.

23:00.138 --> 23:01.337
High divorce rate.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.339
Okay, this is why I don't
tell you guys anything.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.874
We're not getting married,

23:04.876 --> 23:06.643
we're not getting tattoos.
(chuckles)

23:06.645 --> 23:08.912
We're dating,
as you old people call it.

23:08.914 --> 23:10.146
DANNY:
Even just dating a guy

23:10.148 --> 23:11.481
in the uniform,

23:11.483 --> 23:13.116
it's not like dating
a regular person,

23:13.118 --> 23:15.618
with a regular job,
which is stressful enough.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.253
It's a cop, I mean, that's...

23:17.255 --> 23:18.288
Dating them is impossible.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.956
You guys make it work.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.492
Almost a deal breaker
for your grandma.

23:22.494 --> 23:23.593
I didn't know that.

23:23.595 --> 23:24.994
Yeah, she was petrified the job

23:24.996 --> 23:26.596
would make her a widow.

23:29.501 --> 23:31.768
I used to tell your mother
I had a desk job.

23:31.770 --> 23:34.170
She finally realized I was lying
when I got shot on duty.

23:34.172 --> 23:35.605
LINDA: You know, it's a lot
harder than it looks,

23:35.607 --> 23:38.308
to see the love of your life
go off to work knowing that,

23:38.310 --> 23:40.176
because of that job,
there's always a chance

23:40.178 --> 23:42.045
that he might not come back.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.514
And these days, just putting
the uniform on, you're a target.

23:44.516 --> 23:45.982
Then why do you do it?

23:45.984 --> 23:48.685
Well, if I had it to do over again...
You'd still be a cop.

23:48.687 --> 23:50.353
You're right.

23:50.355 --> 23:51.621
I loved every minute of it.

23:51.623 --> 23:52.655
LINDA: Well, I, for one,

23:52.657 --> 23:55.024
do not want to see
Jack and Sean become cops.

23:55.026 --> 23:57.127
JACK: Mom, Seriously?
DANNY: Oh, all right.

23:57.129 --> 23:58.962
It's just not worth it.
For what?

23:58.964 --> 24:00.163
Chance to really help people.

24:00.165 --> 24:01.698
The integrity, Linda.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.999
And honor.

24:03.001 --> 24:04.300
And all the good deeds we do.

24:04.302 --> 24:05.769
Exactly.

24:05.771 --> 24:07.670
But aren't you too young
to be dating anyway?

24:07.672 --> 24:09.739
Yes.
I'm 19 years old, Uncle Danny.

24:09.741 --> 24:12.642
DANNY: Well, you'll always be a
seven-year-old girl in my eyes.

24:12.644 --> 24:14.544
You know,
my granddaughter's growing up.

24:14.546 --> 24:15.812
She's almost an adult,

24:15.814 --> 24:18.081
so I'm just gonna butt out.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.950
Thank you, Grandpa.

24:35.734 --> 24:38.601
You sent a message back
to him for God's sake?

24:39.905 --> 24:41.671
You said
he's pushing my buttons.

24:41.673 --> 24:42.972
Well, now I'm pushing his.

24:42.974 --> 24:45.975
You called him a mama's boy,
misogynistic.

24:45.977 --> 24:47.644
That was not smart.

24:47.646 --> 24:48.745
That's what he is.

24:48.747 --> 24:51.247
He likes to humiliate women
to show his dominance.

24:51.249 --> 24:52.849
Well, now he's being humiliated.

24:52.851 --> 24:54.250
And he's losing control.

24:54.252 --> 24:56.085
(phone ringing)
He's not the only one.

24:56.087 --> 24:58.788
Reagan.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.458
I know what
you're trying to do, Detective.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.929
But using my mother
to try to get to me?

25:05.931 --> 25:09.299
That's a very bad thing to do.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.568
That's messing with my family.

25:13.338 --> 25:14.604
Well?

25:14.606 --> 25:17.407
Your mommy used
to humiliate you, didn't she?

25:17.409 --> 25:20.410
She abused you,
she made you feel worthless.

25:20.412 --> 25:23.446
Beautiful wife.

25:23.448 --> 25:25.515
Two handsome boys.

25:25.517 --> 25:26.683
Now that your mom's gone,

25:26.685 --> 25:28.418
who are you gonna kill
these women for, huh?

25:28.420 --> 25:30.720
But when you mess
with my family,

25:30.722 --> 25:33.556
that means
I have to mess with yours.

25:33.558 --> 25:35.225
It's over for you.

25:35.227 --> 25:38.761
It's not over until I say so.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.964
I'll tell your family
you said hello.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.267
He's making his move.

25:44.269 --> 25:46.502
(drawer opens, then slams)

25:46.504 --> 25:48.271
You coming?

25:51.109 --> 25:52.242
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

25:52.244 --> 25:53.910
I'm sorry your father's case

25:53.912 --> 25:55.778
didn't turn out
as you expected.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.948
I'm fine, Erin, really.
I've accepted it.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.584
Well, apparently, he hasn't.

26:01.586 --> 26:02.719
Wait, you spoke to him?

26:02.721 --> 26:06.155
He thought not saddling you
with the knowledge

26:06.157 --> 26:09.158
of who he really was was the
best gift he could've given you.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.660
Well, I don't know any father

26:10.662 --> 26:13.329
that could resist having
a relationship with their son.

26:13.331 --> 26:14.330
Me either.

26:14.332 --> 26:16.366
Yeah, well, mine could,
as it turns out.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.867
Well,<i> not</i> as it turns out.

26:17.869 --> 26:21.871
He asked for my help to get
a court order to come down here.

26:21.873 --> 26:22.972
Here?

26:22.974 --> 26:25.742
He's in the conference room.

26:35.086 --> 26:36.185
I can't just...

26:36.187 --> 26:39.422
Your father's spent
40 years in Sing Sing.

26:39.424 --> 26:41.024
He's paid for his crimes.

26:41.026 --> 26:42.759
Warden said he's been
a model prisoner.

26:42.761 --> 26:44.961
That's the only reason
they didn't object

26:44.963 --> 26:46.329
to him coming down here.

26:46.331 --> 26:49.098
Do you really want to back
not hearing what he has to say?

26:49.100 --> 26:50.600
Telling him how you feel?

26:54.506 --> 26:56.406
I wouldn't know what to say.

26:56.408 --> 26:59.008
Maybe just listen.

27:10.121 --> 27:12.322
People think you're a badass.

27:12.324 --> 27:14.357
I think you're just
a big softy.

27:14.359 --> 27:17.794
(chuckles)
Don't tell anyone.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.186
(sirens wailing)

27:43.188 --> 27:44.954
(tires screech)

27:50.795 --> 27:53.696
Linda!

27:53.698 --> 27:55.865
Linda!

27:57.402 --> 27:58.401
Linda!

27:58.403 --> 27:59.602
(sighs)

27:59.604 --> 28:00.870
LINDA (outside):
Good boy. Watch him.

28:00.872 --> 28:02.505
Easy.

28:02.507 --> 28:03.773
Oh, guys...

28:06.378 --> 28:08.411
(panting)
Danny.

28:08.413 --> 28:09.445
What's wrong?
Nothing.

28:09.447 --> 28:11.247
You okay?
Yeah, everything's good.

28:11.249 --> 28:12.448
Are you okay?

28:12.450 --> 28:14.017
Everyone's good?
Yeah.

28:14.019 --> 28:14.951
What's going on?

28:14.953 --> 28:16.219
Nothing, everything's fine.

28:16.221 --> 28:17.253
Why'd he lie? He never lies.

28:17.255 --> 28:18.221
He said he's going
after my family.

28:18.223 --> 28:19.255
He always does what he says.

28:19.257 --> 28:21.024
Maybe he was just trying
to scare you.

28:21.026 --> 28:23.693
Guys like Wilder, they don't
usually break their MO.

28:23.695 --> 28:25.795
(quietly):
His MO.

28:25.797 --> 28:27.630
18 to 22 year old females.

28:27.632 --> 28:29.332
(sighs)

28:29.334 --> 28:30.333
Danny, what?

28:30.335 --> 28:31.434
Nicky, it's Nicky.

28:31.436 --> 28:33.636
Stay here with them,
it's my niece, Nicky.

28:38.476 --> 28:40.009
What's going on?

28:40.011 --> 28:41.210
(quietly):
It's okay.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.619
(tires squealing)

28:53.425 --> 28:55.458
Hey, I'm Reagan, where's Nicky?

28:55.460 --> 28:56.759
We haven't been able
to locate her yet.

28:56.761 --> 28:59.662
Her roommate said she left about
a half hour ago to do laundry.

28:59.664 --> 29:01.130
Laundry, where's the laundry?

29:01.132 --> 29:02.131
Across the hall.

29:02.133 --> 29:03.599
Down there?
Yeah.

29:03.601 --> 29:05.568
But he's not there!

29:07.505 --> 29:09.939
Get out of the way!
Hey!

29:10.942 --> 29:12.308
Nicky?

29:23.288 --> 29:24.687
(panting)

29:44.929 --> 29:46.128
Come on, come on, keep looking.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.283
She's got to be there somewhere.
Just keep rewinding.

29:49.209 --> 29:51.442
Zoom in.

29:52.879 --> 29:56.080
That son of a bitch
wore a police uniform.

29:56.082 --> 29:57.482
It makes sense.

29:57.484 --> 29:59.550
That's why he hasn't
been caught, okay?

29:59.552 --> 30:02.086
We give out a description, but
when you're wearing a uniform...

30:02.088 --> 30:03.621
People only see the uniform.

30:03.623 --> 30:05.756
Hey, you got cameras
in the parking garage?

30:05.758 --> 30:07.158
Bring 'em up and
back 'em up about 15 minutes.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.894
PARKER:
Right there.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.800
Zoom in on the license plate.

30:16.936 --> 30:18.603
Danny.

30:18.605 --> 30:20.671
Tell me it isn't true.

30:27.247 --> 30:29.280
GORMLEY:
We got Wilder's photo

30:29.282 --> 30:32.750
and Nicky's photo on every
smartphone, every tablet,

30:32.752 --> 30:36.154
and on the NYPD app,
Web site and social media sites.

30:36.156 --> 30:37.321
GARRETT:
Just hearing those two names

30:37.323 --> 30:38.322
in the same sentence...

30:38.324 --> 30:40.825
I know.

30:40.827 --> 30:42.326
What about the Aviation unit?

30:42.328 --> 30:43.628
You want me to notify them?

30:43.630 --> 30:44.595
Can't do that, Sid.

30:44.597 --> 30:46.631
Boss, you can do
anything you want.

30:48.868 --> 30:52.203
How many kidnappings
we ever put Aviation up?

30:52.205 --> 30:54.472
I don't care--
it's your granddaughter.

30:55.808 --> 30:59.343
That's not how this works.

30:59.345 --> 31:00.711
(phone rings)

31:00.713 --> 31:01.746
I got to...

31:01.748 --> 31:02.980
Go.

31:06.052 --> 31:08.252
(door closes)

31:09.656 --> 31:12.190
Sid's just trying to help.

31:12.192 --> 31:13.424
Yes.

31:13.426 --> 31:15.660
All anybody is.

31:15.662 --> 31:19.096
(sighs) I know.

31:19.098 --> 31:20.264
Coffee?

31:23.336 --> 31:24.669
I'm not in the trenches.

31:24.671 --> 31:27.905
I don't run operations.

31:27.907 --> 31:30.408
It's up to the chiefs,
down to the cops on the beat

31:30.410 --> 31:32.743
to get this right.

31:32.745 --> 31:33.911
I know, Frank.

31:40.019 --> 31:41.018
(sighs)

31:41.020 --> 31:43.287
I just want
my granddaughter back.

31:52.065 --> 31:55.600
(indistinct radio chatter)

31:55.602 --> 31:56.901
Detective Reagan!

31:56.903 --> 31:58.035
Who are you?

31:58.037 --> 32:00.338
I'm Officer Phillips,
Nicky's boyfriend.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.439
Have you heard from her?

32:01.441 --> 32:02.840
We were supposed
to meet for breakfast.

32:02.842 --> 32:03.631
She told me to meet her here.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.277
- At her apartment?
- Yeah.

32:05.278 --> 32:07.578
When was your last contact with her?
7:52.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.313
That's less than an hour ago.
Okay, come on.

32:09.315 --> 32:10.948
I want to help.

32:10.950 --> 32:12.850
You can help by staying here
and letting us do our job.

32:12.852 --> 32:13.951
If you know anything...

32:13.953 --> 32:15.820
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

32:15.822 --> 32:18.222
(phone ringing)

32:18.224 --> 32:20.524
It's Nicky's phone.

32:20.526 --> 32:22.293
What?
It's Nicky's phone!

32:22.295 --> 32:23.261
Okay, listen, stay calm,

32:23.263 --> 32:24.762
Use her name as much
as possible.

32:24.764 --> 32:26.364
Make her a person to him.
Yeah.

32:26.366 --> 32:28.132
I got it. Hello?

32:28.134 --> 32:29.433
(muffled crying)

32:29.435 --> 32:30.668
Hello, Detective.

32:31.971 --> 32:34.372
What do you want, Wilder?

32:34.374 --> 32:37.308
Things have gotten
more interesting, I think.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.644
(crying continues)

32:42.415 --> 32:45.016
I know you got Nicky,
just tell me she's all right.

32:45.018 --> 32:46.317
She's fine.

32:46.319 --> 32:48.653
For now.

32:48.655 --> 32:50.688
Look, you want
to get back at me,

32:50.690 --> 32:52.323
you don't need her
to do it, okay?

32:52.325 --> 32:54.492
She's not like me--
she's an innocent kid.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.826
You don't have to hurt her.

32:57.196 --> 32:59.530
Would you like
to speak with her?

33:07.073 --> 33:08.372
(sobbing):
Uncle Danny.

33:08.374 --> 33:10.441
Nicky.
Oh, my God.

33:11.644 --> 33:12.576
Nicky, don't say...

33:12.578 --> 33:14.078
I'm near Beach...
Hey!

33:14.080 --> 33:15.846
(screaming, grunts)

33:18.951 --> 33:21.118
Nicky! Nicky?

33:24.857 --> 33:27.058
(sobbing)

33:28.695 --> 33:31.462
You stupid bitch.

33:31.464 --> 33:32.430
Nicky!

33:32.432 --> 33:33.898
What happened?
What, is she alive?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.633
She's alive, she's alive.
Listen to me.

33:35.635 --> 33:36.934
He called from her phone,

33:36.936 --> 33:38.536
which means TARU can track it.

33:38.538 --> 33:39.637
I got to get this phone to them

33:39.639 --> 33:40.805
right away.

33:40.807 --> 33:41.972
Okay, let me know what you get.

33:41.974 --> 33:43.808
You got it.
Hey, where you going?

33:43.810 --> 33:44.742
I'm going with you.

33:44.744 --> 33:45.810
You can't come with me.

33:45.812 --> 33:47.945
What else am I
supposed to do, Danny?

33:49.449 --> 33:51.115
DANNY:
<i>Copy that.</i>

33:51.117 --> 33:53.017
<i>They traced Nicky's phone</i>
<i>to Beach Channel Road.</i>

33:53.019 --> 33:55.186
(siren chirping)

34:00.326 --> 34:02.660
That's Wilder's car.

34:02.662 --> 34:04.195
You got your gun on you?
Yeah, I got it.

34:04.197 --> 34:06.397
Call 911. Get some backup.

34:07.633 --> 34:09.233
You keep your eyes open, okay?

34:27.920 --> 34:30.788
(sobbing)

34:33.826 --> 34:35.192
Okay. It's okay.

34:35.194 --> 34:37.428
I got you, I got you.

34:37.429 --> 34:38.529
She okay?

34:38.531 --> 34:39.663
Yeah.

34:39.665 --> 34:42.632
(sobbing continues)

34:42.635 --> 34:44.034
Okay.

34:44.036 --> 34:44.802
Tell me you're okay.

34:44.804 --> 34:46.437
I'm okay.

34:46.438 --> 34:48.205
Did he hurt you?
No.

34:48.206 --> 34:50.940
Listen to me,
how long ago did he leave you?

34:50.943 --> 34:52.676
Five, ten minutes.

34:52.678 --> 34:54.712
Okay, okay.
You stay with her,

34:54.714 --> 34:56.847
Keep your eyes open
and keep your hand on that gun!

34:56.849 --> 34:58.115
Okay.
Mom...

35:09.262 --> 35:11.529
♪ ♪

35:38.458 --> 35:40.191
You found me.

35:43.262 --> 35:45.029
Very good, Detective.

35:45.031 --> 35:47.431
You messed
with the wrong family.

35:47.433 --> 35:48.899
This may be true,

35:48.901 --> 35:51.001
but I needed a challenge.

35:51.003 --> 35:52.570
Been waiting for you
to get here.

35:52.572 --> 35:54.805
Don't take another step forward!

35:54.807 --> 35:58.509
You know the most
interesting part of all this?

35:58.511 --> 36:01.946
We will be inextricably
linked together, you and I.

36:01.948 --> 36:03.981
The serial killer

36:03.983 --> 36:05.583
and the cop.

36:05.585 --> 36:07.184
We're a lot alike.

36:07.186 --> 36:08.686
You're good at what you do, too.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.688
I'm nothing like you,
you son of a bitch.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.756
Now keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

36:16.128 --> 36:18.028
I said keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

36:19.665 --> 36:22.066
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

36:26.105 --> 36:28.272
Now...

36:28.274 --> 36:31.008
if I have a gun in my hand,
and you shoot me...

36:33.145 --> 36:35.946
...then you killed me
in self-defense.

36:41.787 --> 36:44.054
But what if I don't
have a gun, Detective?

36:44.056 --> 36:46.690
You move your hands again,
I'm gonna shoot you.

36:46.692 --> 36:50.561
Then everyone will say
you shot an unarmed man.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.034
See, whether I live or die,

36:57.036 --> 37:00.471
I'm going to be
with you forever.

37:02.108 --> 37:05.943
I'm never leaving
the inside of your head.

37:13.119 --> 37:14.885
Danny!
Mom!

37:14.887 --> 37:16.820
Danny!

37:26.465 --> 37:28.666
(panting, muttering)

37:33.973 --> 37:36.840
(sirens wailing)

37:40.046 --> 37:41.812
How's Nicky?

37:41.814 --> 37:43.547
She'll be okay.

37:43.549 --> 37:45.082
Okay.

37:45.084 --> 37:47.151
So it was self-defense?

37:49.488 --> 37:51.055
It was justified.

38:02.635 --> 38:05.869
New York is a city where dreams
are realized and broken.

38:05.871 --> 38:08.072
If there's one thing
I learned this week,

38:08.074 --> 38:10.774
it's that Commissioner Reagan
is not only a good host,

38:10.776 --> 38:14.378
but a testament to
Irish wisdom and ingenuity.

38:14.380 --> 38:15.980
There is no more fitting

38:15.982 --> 38:17.181
a man to preside over

38:17.183 --> 38:18.449
this great department,

38:18.451 --> 38:21.619
as we bestow this honor on
the City of New York.

38:21.621 --> 38:24.088
A city that became the gateway

38:24.090 --> 38:27.658
to literally millions
of immigrants,

38:27.660 --> 38:29.426
all looking for a better life.

38:29.428 --> 38:32.196
And with that,
I'd like to unveil...

38:32.198 --> 38:33.797
"The Copper."

38:33.799 --> 38:36.266
(applause)

38:39.271 --> 38:41.338
Ladies and gentleman,

38:41.340 --> 38:42.706
Commissioner Reagan.

38:42.708 --> 38:44.375
(applause continues)

38:56.722 --> 38:58.656
Thank you,
Garda Commissioner Farrelly,

38:58.658 --> 39:00.824
President Sullivan,

39:00.826 --> 39:03.727
and all our fellow
police officers and dignitaries

39:03.729 --> 39:05.429
from both sides of the Atlantic.

39:05.431 --> 39:08.365
Whether you're in Dublin
or New York,

39:08.367 --> 39:11.135
or anywhere else in the world,

39:11.137 --> 39:14.471
what makes the job
of a police officer remarkable

39:14.473 --> 39:18.709
is that, unlike any other,

39:18.711 --> 39:22.980
the job not only engages
the one walking the beat...

39:24.817 --> 39:27.718
...but can only be accomplished

39:27.720 --> 39:32.356
with the full support
of the family...

39:37.563 --> 39:40.297
...he or she comes home to...

39:41.567 --> 39:43.400
...and the communities

39:43.402 --> 39:46.136
he or she patrols.

39:46.138 --> 39:50.107
It is, after all, the beat cop,

39:50.109 --> 39:52.009
the cop who walks the streets,

39:52.011 --> 39:53.811
who patrols the neighborhoods,

39:53.813 --> 39:56.213
who answers the calls
that ultimately

39:56.215 --> 40:00.617
keeps order and restores peace
in our society.

40:02.722 --> 40:05.656
He or she is...

40:05.658 --> 40:09.526
the heart of policing,

40:09.528 --> 40:11.495
and the heart
of every city,

40:11.497 --> 40:14.598
because without that presence...

40:16.569 --> 40:20.738
...we are not gathered
here together in peace

40:20.740 --> 40:23.407
on this fine afternoon.

40:25.111 --> 40:28.145
And hopefully...

40:32.284 --> 40:34.218
...this statue will always stand

40:34.220 --> 40:36.320
as a reminder of that.

40:36.322 --> 40:38.255
Thank you.

40:38.257 --> 40:41.325
