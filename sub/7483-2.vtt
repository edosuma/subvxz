WEBVTT

00:24.290 --> 00:26.358
(doorbell rings)

00:57.524 --> 00:59.591
Oh, wow.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.402
(barking)

01:10.404 --> 01:12.137
Whoa. Hey, buddy.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.205
Shh.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.306
It's okay.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.117
Oh, my God.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.512
MAN:
<i>Fundamentally, this phase</i>
<i>of our investigation</i>

01:53.514 --> 01:57.516
is a fact-finding mission.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.452
And unfortunately, Ms. Lange,
your open hostility

02:00.454 --> 02:03.555
is making it difficult
for all of us.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.492
You're not going to respond?

02:06.494 --> 02:07.626
I-I'm sorry.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.462
Was there a question
in there somewhere?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.499
Why are you stonewalling us,
Ms. Lange?

02:20.240 --> 02:22.241
You have to at least pretend

02:22.243 --> 02:23.909
to give me advice.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.411
You are my attorney.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.881
I am. But every time
I give you advice,

02:28.883 --> 02:30.449
you ignore me.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.650
And to be honest,
I'm not even sure

02:31.652 --> 02:33.519
what your play is here.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.288
(indistinct whispering)

02:36.290 --> 02:37.556
You're not supposed to.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.592
Just... say this.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.463
And sit up...

02:44.465 --> 02:46.532
straight.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.737
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.606
I, uh, I understand
your frustration.

02:54.608 --> 02:58.210
But you and the Intelligence
Oversight Committee

02:58.212 --> 03:00.345
have to understand the,

03:00.347 --> 03:03.248
uh, delicate nature
of the work

03:03.250 --> 03:05.250
Ms. Lange is responsible for.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.318
We are

03:06.320 --> 03:07.853
trying to give you
full disclosure,

03:07.855 --> 03:10.355
while still, uh, protecting

03:10.357 --> 03:13.425
active and ongoing operations.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.428
We appreciate the nature
of Ms. Lange's concern.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.629
Thank you.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.598
I'm sure Mr. Thomas
has no intention

03:19.600 --> 03:23.502
of putting
agents' lives at risk.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.771
Of course not.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.941
Good, because preventing that

03:28.943 --> 03:31.910
will take a little
extra patience

03:31.912 --> 03:34.947
on the part of you
and your committee.

03:34.949 --> 03:37.583
Ah. All right, then.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.519
Let's talk Afghanistan,
shall we?

03:40.521 --> 03:43.322
(thunder rolls)

03:44.824 --> 03:46.625
(whoops)

03:46.627 --> 03:47.893
Welcome to Thunderdome.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.528
What's up, girl, huh?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.596
You all right?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.297
Oh, I'm good.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.306
Just for the record,
you're a terrible dancer.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.674
Oh, yeah?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.509
How do you feel about that?

04:04.511 --> 04:05.777
(both grunt)

04:05.779 --> 04:06.979
You know what it is?

04:06.981 --> 04:08.614
You lack the poise

04:08.616 --> 04:10.983
that most girls get from
doing ballet and gymnastics.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.352
Probably 'cause you spent
so much time as a tomboy.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.854
(both grunting)

04:15.856 --> 04:17.522
Get out of this, huh?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.691
Get out of this now!

04:19.693 --> 04:22.694
(both grunting)

04:22.696 --> 04:25.264
Wow, that's a pretty nice move.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.698
Did you learn that
in pole dancing?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.333
What did you say?

04:28.335 --> 04:31.003
(grunts)
God, you punch like a girl!

04:31.005 --> 04:33.805
(groans)

04:33.807 --> 04:35.741
Uh, Beale, tag up!

04:35.743 --> 04:37.743
(grunting)

04:37.745 --> 04:39.745
Oh, no...
(grunts)

04:39.747 --> 04:41.647
Oh, tag up!

04:41.649 --> 04:43.548
Brother, tag up! Aah!

04:43.550 --> 04:44.716
Beale!
Tap out!

04:44.718 --> 04:46.051
Beale!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.586
Deeks, tap out!

04:47.588 --> 04:48.620
Aah! Beale!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.022
Tap out!
Oh!

04:50.024 --> 04:51.723
Yes!
What the hell, man?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.825
Yes!

04:53.827 --> 04:55.494
Where were you on
that one, Beale?

04:55.496 --> 04:56.728
What? What was I supposed to do?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.797
What do you mean, what
were you supposed to do?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.032
You're supposed to come off

05:00.034 --> 05:01.700
the turnbuckle
with the atomic elbow.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.602
Dude, I don't watch wrestling.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.469
What?!

05:04.471 --> 05:05.771
What are you, a Communist?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.340
You hate America?

05:08.342 --> 05:09.775
Granger's up in ops.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.777
Granger probably
watches wrestling.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.980
All right, my friend.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.715
(groans)
I'll meet you up there.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.749
Oh...

05:17.751 --> 05:19.651
You know what?
I am definitely

05:19.653 --> 05:21.320
gonna wash that in the urinal.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.322
Oh, that's okay. It's yours.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.656
What?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.691
(groans)
Come on.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.359
Who does that?

05:27.361 --> 05:29.628
Honestly, that's so disgusting.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.464
Wait, no... Oh!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.666
GRANGER:
<i>Hollywood police got</i>
<i>an anonymous tip</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:36.668
about a dead body this morning.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.537
NELL:
His name is Brian Bell,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.038
a freelance
computer programmer.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.907
And he was strangled to death.

05:41.909 --> 05:45.010
Now, you may recognize
him from this.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.747
He was a
boy genius.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.716
Ah, I mean,
he was bright,

05:50.718 --> 05:53.018
but genius might be
stretching it.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.786
I mean, he did
get caught, right?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.955
You're still my
favorite brain, Beale.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.691
KENSI:
What's his connection
to the Navy?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.861
He was a private contractor who
did cyber security work for us.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.763
Lately he was
trying to penetrate

06:04.765 --> 06:08.400
the online black markets
located in the Deep Net.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.836
The FBI shut down
the Silk Road last year,

06:10.838 --> 06:12.537
but a new one's popped up.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.673
It's called Chauvenet.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.741
"Chauvenet"?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.776
What, is it only
for misogynists?

06:17.778 --> 06:20.379
William Chauvenet, he was
a mathematics professor

06:20.381 --> 06:21.713
in the U.S. Navy.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.615
He also helped to
found Annapolis.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.817
He's also the namesake
of a crater

06:25.819 --> 06:26.885
on the dark side of the moon.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.919
Oh, geek humor--

06:27.921 --> 06:29.821
always better
with a syllabus.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.690
Didn't you take the
silly bus to school?

06:31.692 --> 06:34.793
(clears throat)
So, 90% of the Internet

06:34.795 --> 06:36.061
is inaccessible

06:36.063 --> 06:38.463
through the use of
traditional search engines.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.465
The deeper locations

06:40.467 --> 06:42.100
need to be accessed using
something called Tor,

06:42.102 --> 06:43.668
or onion routers.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.170
It's something
to redirect traffic

06:45.172 --> 06:46.805
through thousands
of different relays

06:46.807 --> 06:48.673
to protect the anonymity
of both the buyers

06:48.675 --> 06:51.576
Everything from weapons
to human trafficking

06:51.578 --> 06:52.744
are sold on these sites.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.414
It's like Amazon
for terrorists.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.481
ERIC:
Exactly.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.883
Rough estimates are:
A billion plus

06:57.885 --> 06:59.751
in contraband is moved a year.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.854
Plus, it's all made
with, uh, virtual currency,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.756
which makes it
even harder to track.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.658
We're not sure
his murder is related.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.627
But if it is,
I want to know why.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.962
Bell had access
to sensitive Navy intelligence.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.533
And he was well-versed in our
own cyber security defenses.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.067
The killer took all of
his computer equipment,

07:16.069 --> 07:18.470
and we can't have that
getting into the wrong hands.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.071
Did they track the hotline tip?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.174
It was made using a pay phone.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.443
Why would he
call it in himself?

07:24.445 --> 07:26.912
And more importantly--
who uses a pay phone?

07:26.914 --> 07:30.215
on the crime scene
for 48 hours, which means

07:30.217 --> 07:32.017
we've got to move fast.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.718
I'm calling in
Callen and Hanna.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.053
Uh, they're actually on a case

07:35.055 --> 07:36.855
that they've been
working on for weeks.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.858
DEEKS:
And the only thing worse than
being undercover for that long

07:39.860 --> 07:43.762
so maybe we should just see
how far we get first. Deal?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.664
This isn't a game show, Deeks.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.032
Get out of here, both of you.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.167
I just got whammied.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.840
Pull Callen and Sam out.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.942
Aye, aye, sir.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.785
(cell phone rings)

08:08.488 --> 08:09.788
Briggs.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.523
ERIC:
Good Morning. I'm calling

08:11.525 --> 08:13.658
on behalf
of Ocean Park Pest Control.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.994
We just wanted to let you know
that our exterminators are done

08:15.996 --> 08:18.063
at your house
and you can return home now.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.532
Thanks, but now's
not a good time.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.833
I see.
Well, my supervisor

08:21.835 --> 08:24.202
was the one
who asked me to call you.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.605
Tell your supervisor
that I can't leave now.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.906
I'm working.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.176
but it's important
that you check in on things

08:31.178 --> 08:33.211
before we close the work order.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.913
Got it.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.915
We at Ocean Park Pest Control
appreciate your business.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.251
Thank you and have a great...
Hello?

08:42.955 --> 08:45.257
Put some effort into it!
This ain't a picnic.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.997
You got a problem, Walinski?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.199
Just relax, man.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.067
It's a thousand degrees
out here.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.737
I suggest you enjoy
the fresh air.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.243
(laughs)
I'm enjoying it now.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.679
Pick it up and
get back to work.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.813
Why don't you pick it up?

09:08.815 --> 09:10.916
SAM:
Pick it up.

09:13.986 --> 09:14.986
(grunts)

09:19.592 --> 09:21.760
Congratulations, Walinski.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.261
You got your wish.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.231
You'll be begging for some sun
after two weeks in the box.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.633
What are you looking at?

09:28.635 --> 09:30.702
Get back to work!
GUARD: You heard him.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.220
This better be good.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.222
Why is that, Agent Hanna?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.824
Because we've been working
a case that's required me

09:52.826 --> 09:54.225
to be locked up for weeks.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.260
He doesn't like
prison food.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.728
Or my cell mate.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.897
Well, you can go back under
when this is done.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.298
Yeah, if we didn't blow
our cover coming out.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.667
Well, that's on you two,
isn't it?

10:02.669 --> 10:05.303
Navy contractor with access
to our cyber defense program

10:05.305 --> 10:07.005
was murdered.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.108
He was trying to identify
those operating a Deep Web site

10:10.110 --> 10:13.211
dealing in drugs and weapons
so that we could shut them down.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.047
Kensi and Deeks are
operating the crime scene.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.116
I need you to talk
to the deceased's next of kin.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.150
A sister.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.154
Think of it as a furlough
for good behavior.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.861
When is Hetty
coming back?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.229
That is a good question.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.297
I mean, seriously, how long

10:32.299 --> 10:34.633
can a hearing drag on?
(short laugh)

10:34.635 --> 10:37.702
That is gonna depend
on how cooperative she is.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.771
Wonderful.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.072
Why did you send

10:41.074 --> 10:43.775
Special Agent Blye
to Afghanistan?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.710
Uh, Ms. Lange has
already answered this.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.147
Agent Blye was taking part
in a joint task force.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.650
A task force that
was, uh, charged

10:51.652 --> 10:54.886
with, uh, finding
a suspected Westerner

10:54.888 --> 10:56.121
working with
the Taliban, correct?

10:56.123 --> 10:57.756
That is correct.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.392
But why Agent Blye?

11:00.394 --> 11:02.327
She had the necessary
skill sets required.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.828
I'm asking Ms. Lange.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.098
How is it, Ms. Lange,

11:07.100 --> 11:09.868
that of all
the specially trained forces

11:09.870 --> 11:11.870
that we have in our country,

11:11.872 --> 11:13.304
Agent Blye,

11:13.306 --> 11:16.207
an NCIS agent
who lives in Los Angeles,

11:16.209 --> 11:19.277
is somehow a better choice
than a Navy SEAL

11:19.279 --> 11:21.346
or an Army Ranger?

11:22.281 --> 11:25.884
Have you been to Afghanistan,
Mr. Thomas?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.919
No, I haven't.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.990
Perhaps I could arrange a visit.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.293
Perhaps you could just answer
the question.

11:37.763 --> 11:41.466
Uh, Agent Blye has something

11:41.468 --> 11:44.035
that no Navy SEAL

11:44.037 --> 11:47.872
or, uh, Army Ranger does.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.342
And, uh, what secret skill
is that?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.178
She's a woman.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.214
ATTORNEY:
Intelligence gathering
can be limited

11:56.216 --> 11:58.016
if you can't talk
to half the population.

11:58.018 --> 12:02.420
The local women
won't talk to men,

12:02.422 --> 12:05.056
but they would, uh,
speak to Agent Blye.

12:05.058 --> 12:09.160
HETTY:
I'm afraid it's not
quite a secret skill,

12:09.162 --> 12:11.162
but perhaps just common sense

12:11.164 --> 12:14.232
for anyone who's had
combat experience

12:14.234 --> 12:17.135
or actually served
their country.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.370
Next question.

12:22.843 --> 12:26.377
Call Adams at the DOJ
and tell him to send

12:26.379 --> 12:28.313
his people in now.
Mm-hmm.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.759
KENSI:
<i>Can you believe this place?</i>

12:40.761 --> 12:42.293
It looks like
a 12-year-old lives here.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.828
How much you want to bet

12:43.830 --> 12:45.463
that Beale's place
looks like this?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.132
You obviously
don't have an appreciation

12:47.134 --> 12:49.033
for sci-fi
and fantasy aesthetic.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.368
Yeah, what is that,
geek chic?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.004
Sorry, but I see a guy's place
full of toys like this,

12:53.006 --> 12:54.506
and I know somebody
has mommy issues.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.108
Well, he's obviously a fan boy,
but you are misjudging this

12:57.110 --> 12:59.344
because some of these are
valuable collectibles.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.312
50 bucks says
he has a sex doll

13:01.314 --> 13:03.114
dressed up like Princess Leia
in his closet.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.183
I'm sorry, what?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.317
They make those?

13:06.319 --> 13:07.385
Wait, how do you know that?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.988
(sighs)

13:09.990 --> 13:13.024
Wow, this guy's even got less
in his fridge than you do.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.259
No wonder his dog
turned on him.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.394
And that is another reason

13:16.396 --> 13:18.263
why I don't have pets.
Yeah, that and the fact

13:18.265 --> 13:21.499
to keep alive in your apartment
was mold and mildew.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.201
I had a mouse once.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.903
Mm-hmm, and it lived
in your cupboard,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.504
and even it died of starvation.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.206
(laughs)

13:28.208 --> 13:30.508
You are so mean.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.980
Hmm. Looks like
he was a little bit

13:35.982 --> 13:37.348
of a conspiracy nut.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.550
Also got a lot

13:38.552 --> 13:40.485
of anarchy
material here, too.

13:43.088 --> 13:44.522
Deeks.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.890
Closet.
Oh.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.292
Is it Princess Leia?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.060
Nope.
Damn it.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.463
I got the same one

13:52.465 --> 13:54.866
in plaid.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.971
Brian started to change
when our parents split.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.340
I was 11.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.575
Brian was eight.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.076
It was an ugly divorce,

14:05.078 --> 14:07.579
and Brian spent most of it
hiding out in his room

14:07.581 --> 14:08.980
playing on his computer.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.015
At the time, it seemed
like a godsend.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.552
He could just put on his
headphones and escape,

14:14.554 --> 14:17.388
but he never
really came back.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.159
Can you think of anybody
that would've wanted him dead?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.961
No.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.562
No, he...

14:24.564 --> 14:27.098
He didn't have any
enemies I knew of.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.499
Or friends, for that matter.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.201
He barely left the house.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.502
He even had
his groceries delivered.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.104
No relationships?

14:33.106 --> 14:34.472
(sighs) No, not really.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.274
Not in the flesh
and blood, anyway.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.509
He was always
happiest online.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.378
He ever talk to you
about his work?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.913
No.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.382
But I wouldn't have
understood it if he did.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.217
He was the boy genius.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.353
I can barely program my DVR.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.521
And he didn't make
any indication recently

14:50.523 --> 14:52.257
that he felt like
he might be in trouble

14:52.259 --> 14:53.424
or feared for his life?

14:54.393 --> 14:57.095
All the time.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.897
He was...

14:58.899 --> 15:00.431
prone to paranoia.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.901
I did what I could
to help him.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.503
I'd even sleep
over some nights,

15:05.505 --> 15:06.938
but I have a family.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.307
I tried to get him
to move in, but...

15:09.309 --> 15:11.009
he wouldn't hear of it.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.611
Well, I'm sure
wherever he is now,

15:13.613 --> 15:15.580
he feels happy and safe.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.249
I'd like to believe that.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.384
Thank you.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.352
If you think of anything else,

15:21.354 --> 15:23.388
give us a call.
Yeah.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.524
Um, I don't suppose either of
you want to adopt his dog.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.159
My place doesn't allow pets.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.161
Oh, I'd love to,

15:30.163 --> 15:32.363
but my daughter's allergic.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.698
G?

15:33.700 --> 15:37.535
I'm never home, but, uh,
thank you.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.337
You sure?

15:39.339 --> 15:40.571
(clears throat)

15:40.573 --> 15:41.606
Take care.
Bye.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.309
Come on.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.476
(chuckles)

15:45.478 --> 15:46.711
Maybe you should reconsider.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.946
What?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.047
The dog.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.481
What am I gonna do with a dog?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.483
Ah, you can take care of it,
play with it,

15:52.485 --> 15:53.518
scratch its ears.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.686
They're man's best friend.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.287
I thought you were
my best friend.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.556
Oh, you want me to scratch
your ears, is that it?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.625
A dog would be good for you.
Come to think of it,

16:00.627 --> 16:02.427
I feed you,
I take you for walks,

16:02.429 --> 16:04.162
and you are
very protective of me.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.230
Don't say it.
You my dog!

16:06.232 --> 16:08.099
(engine starts)
Huh?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.500
You my dog!

16:10.436 --> 16:11.569
Hey.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.570
Open up.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.305
(tires squealing)

16:17.009 --> 16:18.609
Come back, big dog!

16:36.495 --> 16:38.363
So, our dead guy,
Brian Bell,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.631
had some surveillance cameras.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.400
Actually, he had a lot of them.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.235
But whatever
they captured disappeared

16:44.237 --> 16:45.503
with his stolen hard drive.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.606
a lot of people have
surveillance cameras these days,

16:48.608 --> 16:49.741
including his neighbors.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.476
Now, I couldn't find anything

16:51.478 --> 16:53.344
around the time he's thought
to have been killed,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.213
but I did find this.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.715
DEEKS: The coroner said that
Bell had been dead for days,

16:57.717 --> 17:01.119
so this guy broke in after
Bell had already been killed?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.187
NELL:
Yeah, it looks that way.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.289
Now, we don't get a
good look at his face,

17:05.291 --> 17:09.260
so I looked at similar
B and E's in the area and...

17:09.262 --> 17:12.263
KENSI: Hmm, same silver van,
different signage.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.766
NELL: Yep, and they
changed plates every job or so.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.535
Oh, and check this out.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.238
Now, this is the pay phone used
to tip off the police

17:20.240 --> 17:21.406
about the body.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.141
Eric's running it
through image enhancement

17:23.143 --> 17:24.575
and, uh, facial
reconstruction software

17:24.577 --> 17:26.444
to see if we can
get a match.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.213
Well, if he called the cops,
he's obviously not the killer.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.749
No, but whoever stole
Brian Bell's equipment

17:31.751 --> 17:33.718
might have footage
of the guy who is.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.520
Yes.
Oh! What?!

17:35.522 --> 17:37.555
Is that real?
Oh, my God.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.123
It's so glorious.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.358
It's like a... It's like
an angelic bathmat.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.526
I just want to touch it.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.061
It looks so fluffy.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.229
SAM: Clearly I'm no
hair care expert,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.231
but, uh, you shouldn't comment
on hair.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.599
What? No, don't do that.

17:48.601 --> 17:52.136
Don't be jealous of my glorious,
golden, Viking mane.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.738
Although I bet you had
some badass dreadlocks

17:53.740 --> 17:55.706
back in the day.<i> Irie.</i>

17:55.708 --> 17:57.608
Not even close, and please,

17:57.610 --> 17:59.377
(in Jamaican accent):
don't ever say<i> "irie."</i>

17:59.379 --> 18:01.512
All right, then please tell me
that you had an Afro.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.347
Like, an epic Afro
of just, like,

18:03.349 --> 18:06.350
hair orbiting your head
like the Death Star.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.485
Easy, Thor.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.786
Thor.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.388
Maybe a Thor loser.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.689
Maybe he has bed Thors.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.790
Open Thors are the worst.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.460
I had a lisp in high school.
This is too far.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.261
Fair enough.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.563
Maybe you're right.
KENSI: Sorry,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.565
I didn't mean to, uh,
hurt your feelingth.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.367
You delinquents finished?

18:23.369 --> 18:24.802
Where are we?

18:24.804 --> 18:27.105
SAM: We talked to
the dead guy's sister.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.173
Seems like he lived
his life online.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.676
No friendships,
no relationships.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.712
He also had a full military
MOPP suit in his closet.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.347
CALLEN: She said he was
a little paranoid.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.348
NELL:
And Eric's working

18:37.350 --> 18:40.284
who may have stolen
Brian Bell's computer.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.319
We got trouble.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.488
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.662
What the hell
is going on, Beale?

18:51.664 --> 18:52.797
Look.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.701
SAM: That's outside
this building.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.536
Who are they?
Don't let them in

18:58.538 --> 18:59.670
until we know.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.306
NELL:
Department of Justice?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.775
(buzzing)
Someone just buzzed them in.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.444
GRANGER:
All right, stay here.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.513
Jones, with me.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.214
Yeah.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.661
Can I help you?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.296
Assistant Director Owen Granger.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.298
Special Investigator Wallace,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.766
Department of Justice.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.935
This is an order
from the executive branch

19:30.937 --> 19:33.671
for a forensic audit
of this facility

19:33.673 --> 19:36.841
and all employees.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.725
I don't know. I called you
as soon as I got it.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.596
I'll have it sent over.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.665
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.936
Send a copy
to the director's office

20:04.938 --> 20:07.572
and CC the secretary
of the Navy right away.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.443
Everything in order,
Assistant Director?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.945
Since when did
the Department of Justice

20:13.947 --> 20:16.514
become a pawn
for Thomas's personal agenda?

20:16.516 --> 20:18.916
It's a joint investigation.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.453
Okay, so you scratch his back,
and he flays ours.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.523
My team will require
adequate work space

20:25.525 --> 20:28.426
and something that
provides privacy for interviews.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.696
Okay.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.399
Set them up in the gym.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.636
Right this way, ma'am.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.412
KENSI:
So, what's happening?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.881
Full forensic audit
of our operations and personnel.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.416
Bring up the gym feed.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.321
SAM: It's no coincidence
this is happening

20:57.323 --> 20:58.856
while Hetty's in D.C.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.892
They pull her back to Washington
so she's not here to stop them.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.361
So, what are they looking for?

21:03.363 --> 21:04.929
Ammunition to bring down Hetty.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.031
They need a sacrificial lamb.

21:07.033 --> 21:10.968
they'll come after the rest
of us and this whole operation.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.536
So, what do we do?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.038
Make yourselves scarce.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.906
We'll work out
of the boathouse.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.808
Keep your eye
on these guys, Beale.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.710
Copy me on everything

21:19.712 --> 21:21.445
they're looking for,
and don't make it easy.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.447
We need to give Hetty
a heads-up.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.715
BEALE:
She dumped her phone.

21:24.717 --> 21:25.983
She was convinced it's tapped.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.485
(computer trilling)
Let me handle that.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.654
We got a match.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.356
Our anonymous tipster
is Douglas Fisher.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.558
He's got a lengthy
criminal record.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.861
It's about to get longer.

21:42.734 --> 21:46.370
What can you tell us
about Bernstrom Kohl?

21:46.372 --> 21:49.473
(clears throat)

21:49.475 --> 21:51.409
I-I don't know.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.543
Who is he?

21:53.812 --> 21:55.513
He was a German agent
that you shot

21:55.515 --> 21:56.714
several years ago.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.884
Did I kill him?

21:59.886 --> 22:01.352
We don't know.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.054
He disappeared.

22:03.056 --> 22:06.090
I was never
a very good shot.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.925
(chuckles)

22:07.927 --> 22:10.594
THOMAS: Recent evidence has come
to our attention that suggests

22:10.596 --> 22:13.698
that Bernstrom Kohl was
actually sequestered

22:13.700 --> 22:16.000
in a Los Angeles nursing home,

22:16.002 --> 22:18.402
under the name of Branston Cole,

22:18.404 --> 22:21.439
until his death
four years ago.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.074
Huh...

22:23.076 --> 22:25.810
Supposedly,
he had a wife,

22:25.812 --> 22:29.080
who by all accounts
matches your description.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.750
Was she a brunette?

22:36.054 --> 22:41.092
Did you keep a foreign operative
in custody

22:41.094 --> 22:45.763
without this administration's
knowledge or consent?

22:45.765 --> 22:47.732
(clears throat)
Uh, being as this is...

22:47.734 --> 22:52.837
uh, we will need some time
to do our own investigation

22:52.839 --> 22:58.609
in order to determine, uh,
what, if any, ongoing operations

22:58.611 --> 23:01.479
and/or personnel may be affected
by this line of questioning--

23:01.481 --> 23:03.914
for the sake of national
security, of course.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.950
And how long does
Ms. Lange intend to hide

23:05.952 --> 23:07.918
behind the sake
of national security?

23:07.920 --> 23:12.590
I do not hide, Mr. Thomas.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.726
I protect.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.763
And yes,

23:18.765 --> 23:21.899
I did keep Kohl
under my custody

23:21.901 --> 23:25.436
as an asset until he was
murdered by his own country.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.104
Thank you.

23:27.106 --> 23:30.074
And on that revealing note,

23:30.076 --> 23:33.043
I suggest we recess for an hour.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.518
Why would you
admit to that?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.788
Because it
was the truth.

23:43.790 --> 23:47.091
This is Washington-- the truth
is whatever you need it to be.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.127
Careful, I still
have company.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.132
I've had at least two
of them, night and day,

23:55.134 --> 23:56.967
since I've been here.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.204
What do they think I'm going
to do, dash for the border?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.139
Maybe it's
for your own protection.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.841
Protection from what?

24:03.843 --> 24:05.476
Oh, God!
I am so sorry!

24:05.478 --> 24:07.445
Oh, that's okay.

24:11.082 --> 24:12.183
Thank you.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.784
And, again,
I'm really sorry.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.620
Don't worry about it.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.190
I'm going to use the restroom.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.669
(cell phone rings)

24:31.671 --> 24:33.103
Granger.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.140
What's going on, Owen?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.842
Well, we're under siege.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.911
Full forensic audit
and personnel interviews.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.581
DOJ's involved now, too.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.150
Oh, Thomas--
that sneaky bastard.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.854
I may have underestimated him.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.989
I'll do what I can
to contain them,

24:51.991 --> 24:53.791
but they've got
executive branch orders

24:53.793 --> 24:56.927
to go through everything.

24:56.929 --> 25:01.866
Remind Miss Jones
that we have an old building.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.634
Okay.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.135
How you holding up?

25:05.137 --> 25:09.907
Oh, well, I-I think they're
digging me a very deep hole.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.910
Well, you watch your back,
all right?

25:12.912 --> 25:14.945
Always.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.256
Well, told you we should
have called first.

25:25.258 --> 25:28.192
Yeah.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.200
Oh, uh... we're not open.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.136
Yeah, call back later,
make an appointment.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.172
Gonna be easier
just to let us in.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.541
What's this about?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.209
You and a dead guy.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.547
Uh, just not in front
of my workers, all right?

25:49.549 --> 25:50.714
I-I'll be right out.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.985
What are the chances he actually
comes back out of there?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.186
I'd say zero
and none.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.821
Hey, guys. I think
he's coming your way.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.190
KENSI:
We got him.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.159
Fisher! Fisher!

26:02.161 --> 26:03.227
Fisher!
Hey!

26:04.563 --> 26:06.297
It's like playing Whack-A-Mole.

26:07.198 --> 26:09.333
Fisher, open the door!

26:09.335 --> 26:10.901
You're only making it worse
for yourself!

26:23.715 --> 26:26.283
Doesn't he know we're
in the middle of a drought?

26:26.285 --> 26:28.619
Apparently not.

26:40.632 --> 26:44.935
I'd like to begin interviews
with Agents Callen and Hanna.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.670
They're not here today.

26:46.672 --> 26:47.805
Call them in.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.907
Well, they're working a case.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.176
Well, call them in anyway.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.712
We'll begin with Agent Blye
until they arrive.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.848
She's not here, either,

26:57.850 --> 26:59.984
but, look, you can interview me.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.653
I like being
interviewed.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.922
Assistant Director Granger
has 30 minutes

27:04.924 --> 27:06.290
to get his people here--

27:06.292 --> 27:08.859
before we issue warrants
to bring them in.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.160
Got it.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.967
Sir.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.703
The invading horde's
getting restless.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.106
for any agents not here
for interviews.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.308
Okay. Let me
deal with that.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.809
I'm sending Beale
to the boatshed.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.678
You should go, too.
Okay.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.046
Oh, and, uh...

27:29.048 --> 27:30.848
Hetty wanted me to remind you

27:30.850 --> 27:33.817
that this is an old building.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.319
Whatever the hell that means.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.256
Got it.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.016
MAN:
Damn it.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.017
WALLACE:
What was that?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.152
MAN: Some sort
of blackout.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.820
You!

28:09.822 --> 28:11.055
Me?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.423
What's your name?

28:12.425 --> 28:14.458
Uh... Beale. Eric.

28:14.460 --> 28:18.128
Eric Bartholomew Beale III,
to be exact.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.064
Esquire.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.331
Well, what the hell
happened here, Eric?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.466
We lost power.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.235
Oh. Well, this building
is super old

28:25.237 --> 28:26.904
and so is the surrounding grid.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.006
So we get rolling blackouts
this time of day,

28:29.008 --> 28:30.808
especially when everyone's
cranking their AC.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.109
Hope you used protection.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.245
For the surges.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.281
How long's it last?

28:37.283 --> 28:39.049
Uh, well,
if the marine layer rolls in

28:39.051 --> 28:41.018
and the temperature drops,
it could be about 20 minutes.

28:41.953 --> 28:45.222
Uh, but if it stays hot,
probably three or four.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.123
O'clock?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.825
Hours.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.460
Unacceptable.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.228
I know.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.930
Welcome to Los Angeles.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.466
Wh-What about backup generators?

28:55.468 --> 28:58.102
What do we look like,
Homeland Security?

28:58.104 --> 29:00.370
We've been requesting
backup power for years.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.240
Yeah. Oh, maybe you guys can
put in a good word for us

29:03.242 --> 29:05.142
when you get
to Washington.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.412
See what you can do to
get us up and running.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.047
If we don't have
power in 20 minutes,

29:10.049 --> 29:11.048
we're bringing
in generators.

29:11.050 --> 29:16.120
there's a taqueria a few blocks
from here that has free Wi-Fi.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.388
And the best
<i>empanadas de machacas.</i>

29:18.390 --> 29:19.456
Mmm.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.927
<i>No tienes hambres.</i>

29:23.929 --> 29:25.796
<i>Bueno.</i>

29:25.798 --> 29:26.897
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

29:37.208 --> 29:39.343
That's our killer.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.145
Guy slipped in
through the doggie door,

29:41.147 --> 29:42.980
which is why
he didn't trip the alarm.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.082
We have any footage
where we see his face?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.250
No, he's
wearing a mask.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.251
SAM:
Vehicle?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.452
NELL:
Not yet.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.486
I'm still
checking traffic

29:49.488 --> 29:51.088
and neighbor cams.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.257
There is this, however.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.261
The hell's he doing?

29:57.263 --> 29:58.295
Posting it to Murdergram?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.531
He e-mails it to someone.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.266
Proof of death.

30:02.268 --> 30:06.403
Can you get us the number
or the e-mail he sent it to?

30:06.405 --> 30:09.106
I can get a list of numbers
that were active

30:09.108 --> 30:13.177
but I have no way of accessing
that specific phone number.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.078
ERIC: I think I
found a motive.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.280
Where'd, uh, Kensi
and Deeks go?

30:16.282 --> 30:17.915
They're dropping off
Fisher at the LAPD.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.149
What do you have?

30:19.151 --> 30:21.051
All right, Bell was
investigating Chauvenet,

30:21.053 --> 30:25.055
which is operated by someone
calling themselves, uh,

30:25.057 --> 30:26.156
Papa Legba.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.125
SAM:
Papa Legba?

30:28.127 --> 30:32.596
You know, in Haitian voodoo,
Papa Legba is the gatekeeper

30:32.598 --> 30:35.833
at the crossroads
between life and death.

30:35.835 --> 30:38.101
Yeah. Well, I think Bell figured
out Papa Legba's real identity.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.870
So, why didn't he turn him in?

30:39.872 --> 30:41.104
Blackmail.

30:41.106 --> 30:43.006
He wanted half a million dollars
in Bitcoins

30:43.008 --> 30:45.242
to keep Papa Legba's
identity a secret.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.445
Okay. So, Chauvenet
is a Dark Net Deep Web site

30:48.447 --> 30:50.447
that deals in billions
of dollars of illegal goods

30:50.449 --> 30:52.883
and services
that we can't shut down

30:52.885 --> 30:55.519
because we don't know who this
Papa Legba guy is who runs it,

30:55.521 --> 30:58.055
in part because of the way
they can hide using Tor.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.057
And all that
goes away

31:00.059 --> 31:02.092
if you find out Papa
Legba's true identity.

31:02.094 --> 31:05.896
If you're Papa Legba and there's
that much money at stake,

31:05.898 --> 31:07.631
not to mention jail time,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.032
you eliminate the threat.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.202
That, I don't know.
I can't find anywhere

31:12.204 --> 31:13.637
where Bell actually puts
it down in writing.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.873
I'm going through his files
trying to piece it together

31:15.875 --> 31:17.140
from his research.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.142
You can hire a hit man
on Chauvenet's Web site?

31:19.144 --> 31:21.111
ERIC:
Sure.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.479
I'll give you even money--

31:22.481 --> 31:24.514
whoever killed Brian Bell
was hired off Chauvenet.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.984
NELL:
If you can get a list

31:26.986 --> 31:28.619
of those offering
assassination services,

31:28.621 --> 31:31.121
I can run it against
the numbers in the area

31:31.123 --> 31:34.258
We may get lucky,
find some commonality.

31:34.260 --> 31:38.262
What if Brian Bell
wasn't killed?

31:38.264 --> 31:40.964
I mean, the killer
left him for dead,

31:40.966 --> 31:44.001
but what if
he survived?

31:44.003 --> 31:46.937
Police are sitting
on this for us.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.108
We use the anonymity
of the Web to reach out

31:51.110 --> 31:53.644
to Papa Legba
as Brian Bell.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.913
Tell him
his plan didn't work.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.181
We want a million dollars
by the end of the day,

31:58.183 --> 31:59.616
or we send his name
to the Feds.

31:59.618 --> 32:02.019
Whoa. Won't they suspect
it's a trap?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.487
Not if we make it look
believable.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.155
We send Papa Legba photos
of Bell's wounds.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.658
We just have to make sure it
looks like he's still alive.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.259
You hire me to kill somebody

32:09.261 --> 32:11.061
and they survive
the first attempt...

32:11.063 --> 32:13.230
Gotta come back and finish
the job so you get paid.

32:13.232 --> 32:17.301
Mmm. Satisfaction guaranteed.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.674
You know what, this was
Sam and Callen's idea--

32:23.676 --> 32:26.209
maybe they should be the ones
here doing corpse selfies.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.979
Yeah, they probably figured
you've done this before, so...

32:28.981 --> 32:30.213
Well, I have dated
some lifeless women,

32:30.215 --> 32:31.381
but none of them
were actually dead.

32:31.383 --> 32:34.952
Oh, wow. Look at you. Nice.
You know what that is?

32:34.954 --> 32:37.621
So, uh, how are we gonna
make this guy look

32:37.623 --> 32:38.622
like he's still alive?

32:38.624 --> 32:39.957
It's called makeup.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.992
Oh, yeah?
It does wonders on you.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.126
Shut up.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.162
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do, uh...

32:45.164 --> 32:47.998
You are going to help me
put him in a chair.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.400
Okay, but if this guy leaks
dead-guy juice on me,

32:50.402 --> 32:51.635
I'm gonna freak out.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.104
I think we should use
your... your shirt.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.238
What?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.007
You want me to give you...?
No, no.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.742
(laughs)
No. This is my favorite shirt.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.344
You're not putting it
on a dead guy.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.511
Hey, relax, princess.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.980
I'll dry-clean it.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.614
You can't wash out ghost!

33:04.616 --> 33:05.615
That doesn't
even make any sense.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.616
Give me your shirt.
No.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.617
Give me your shirt.
No.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.618
Deeks, give me your shirt.
No.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.619
Give me your shirt!
No.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.620
Why are you being weird?
No.

33:10.622 --> 33:14.725
There is no version of me
that gives you this shirt.

33:16.294 --> 33:19.463
All right, I'm sending
the photo to Papa Legba now,

33:19.465 --> 33:21.498
saying that I know
he tried to have me killed,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.633
and for that, the price
of his anonymity has gone up

33:23.635 --> 33:26.703
And he's got
three hours to deliver. Cool?

33:26.705 --> 33:28.305
Send it.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.240
Now what?

33:30.242 --> 33:32.676
Now we wait.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.678
Put this on.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.480
Am I gonna need this?

33:36.482 --> 33:37.514
Hopefully not.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.182
It's for your own protection.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.283
Should I have a gun?

33:40.285 --> 33:42.119
Absolutely not.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.021
That's for our protection.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.122
(computer beeps)

33:45.124 --> 33:48.191
That was fast. It's Papa Legba.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.060
We got his attention.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.262
ERIC:
"Give me a couple hours
to get the money.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.198
"Half now, $50,000 a week
for ten weeks to follow.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.666
Acceptable? Papa Legba."

33:56.668 --> 33:57.734
Say yes.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.636
If we're gonna get company,

33:59.638 --> 34:01.238
it'll be within a couple hours.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.773
All right, what should I do now?

34:02.775 --> 34:05.709
And don't leave this room
under any circumstance.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.778
What if I have to pee?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.582
What if there's a fire?

34:12.584 --> 34:15.118
Then I suggest you fill it.

34:16.421 --> 34:18.688
Stay put.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.799
Bad doggie.

34:36.707 --> 34:39.076
You clearly shouldn't
have any pets.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.226
"Daniel Howard."

34:56.228 --> 35:00.163
It's an interesting résumé, man.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.466
"ROTC...

35:02.468 --> 35:05.335
"National Guard,

35:05.337 --> 35:08.472
West Hollywood
Sheriff's Department."

35:08.474 --> 35:10.874
For about eight seconds.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.342
Till you turned
the evidence lockup

35:12.344 --> 35:13.677
into a personal pharmacy.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.345
I don't know
what you're talking...

35:15.347 --> 35:17.147
Talking about? That's what
everybody says when they know

35:17.149 --> 35:19.516
exactly what we're talking about
but they don't want to admit it.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.784
SAM:
Daniel, we've got
footage of you

35:20.786 --> 35:23.520
murdering Brian Bell.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.522
Not to mention
you going back

35:25.524 --> 35:27.891
to finish the job
when you thought he survived.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.460
CALLEN:
They say criminals always
return to the crime scene,

35:30.462 --> 35:34.498
but that's actually not true
unless they're just... dumb.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.268
SAM:
Look, Daniel, you only
got one play here.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.637
One play only.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.506
Tell us who hired you.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.674
I don't know anything
about a murder.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.710
I was only trying
to rob the place.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.278
With a silencer
on your gun?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.646
Plus you took a picture

35:49.648 --> 35:52.549
of Brian Bell
after you killed him,

35:52.551 --> 35:55.218
you e-mailed it to someone...

35:55.220 --> 35:57.320
on your phone.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.525
SAM:
We call that a
"death dunk."

36:01.527 --> 36:04.194
Mm-hmm.
Death penalty slam dunk.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.932
E-mails between Papa Legba
and our Mr. Howard

36:08.934 --> 36:11.835
discussing the hit,
the price, everything.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.605
I don't know who he is.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.507
I swear.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.776
That's the whole purpose
of Chauvenet.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.444
It's anonymous.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.281
I have no idea
who Papa Legba is.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.316
Nobody does.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.485
But the man you murdered did,

36:28.487 --> 36:32.422
which is why Papa Legba
hired you to kill him.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.462
KENSI:
I don't think he knows
Papa Legba's true identity.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.831
Yeah? Then how did
Brian Bell find it?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.333
Well, he spent
months searching.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.868
We've only been at
it a couple days.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.269
Guys, guys.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.470
I think I know who he is.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.640
Okay, Papa Legba
created Chauvenet.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.442
And like any new
product or service,

36:52.444 --> 36:54.477
you have to advertise
so people can find you.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.247
So I started searching
for the first mentions of it.

36:57.249 --> 37:00.784
Like similar sites,
it starts out as rumors.

37:00.786 --> 37:04.454
So I chased down the first users
to post or chat about it.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.456
Most were from e-mail addresses

37:06.458 --> 37:10.227
that were used once or twice
but then never again.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.696
I figured out
who they're registered to.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.498
And six belonged to one man.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.436
Behold Justin Stewart, aka...

37:19.438 --> 37:20.904
Papa Legba.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.673
He looks like he works
after school at Foot Locker.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.408
(laughs)
And, uh,

37:25.410 --> 37:27.410
here's the best part--
he leases a recycling facility

37:27.412 --> 37:29.746
in Los Angeles,
but with no business license

37:29.748 --> 37:31.781
and no contracts.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.850
Hmm. Boy genius.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.723
(man humming)

37:43.494 --> 37:45.562
(clears throat)

37:46.564 --> 37:49.566
Mmm. Got a half
a muffin in here.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.268
Where are we?

37:51.270 --> 37:52.936
NELL: Looks like he has
at least one armed guard

37:52.938 --> 37:54.537
at a lobby security desk.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.439
Sending you guys

37:56.441 --> 37:58.541

Thanks, Eric.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.512

surveillance feeds?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.648
Sorry. This guy is careful.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.750
All right, finish your 360,
Deeks, then we move.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.551
Oh...

38:08.553 --> 38:10.620
(grumbling)

38:13.457 --> 38:15.325
(clears throat)

38:15.327 --> 38:18.361
Got a, uh, guard
out back smoking.

38:18.363 --> 38:19.696
Lot of security for a place

38:19.698 --> 38:22.032
recycling cereal boxes
and soup cans.

CALLEN:
Papa Legba's one careful guy.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.670

gonna be more inside.

Get off me!
Get in the car!

38:43.655 --> 38:45.855
I'm not going with you!
Get in the car!

38:45.857 --> 38:47.691
No! Get...
Look, get in or I'm
gonna drag you in!

38:47.693 --> 38:49.359
Get in the car!
Let, let go of me!

38:49.361 --> 38:51.094
Stop it! Stop!
Get-get in the car!

38:51.096 --> 38:52.462
Is there a problem here?!

38:52.464 --> 38:53.763
Hey! Get...
Yes!

38:53.765 --> 38:55.432
Get in the car!
He's trying to abduct me.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.666
Why don't you come inside, miss?

38:56.668 --> 38:57.567
Get in the car!
No!

38:57.569 --> 38:58.601
Get in your car

38:58.603 --> 39:01.905
Mind your business!
This is a private matter.

39:01.907 --> 39:04.841
Get in your car and drive away.

39:06.744 --> 39:07.911
Pretty brave for
a rent-a-cop.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.446
Try me.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.756
Put it down.

Papa Legba, I presume.

40:37.468 --> 40:39.135
I want to speak

40:39.137 --> 40:41.571
I bet you do.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.181
Safe?

40:51.183 --> 40:53.216
For the time being.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.485
Our unwanted friends

40:55.487 --> 40:56.753

Department leave?

40:56.755 --> 40:59.155
No. But they've only
got a skeleton crew

40:59.157 --> 41:00.590
working during the night.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.559
They'll be back with
a vengeance tomorrow,

41:02.561 --> 41:05.228
and I can only hold
them off for so long.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.632
You guys did good today.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.100
Putting these guys out
of business was big.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.769

That's great.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.043
(sighs)

41:20.045 --> 41:21.878
So, what's wrong?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.847
We're running standard
protocol searches

41:23.849 --> 41:25.682
through the Chauvenet files.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.750
We got a hit on this.

41:31.889 --> 41:34.123
I recognize that address.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.527
If you replace the number
13 in the file name

41:37.529 --> 41:40.897
with the word "thirteen,"
it becomes an anagram.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.866
That's why I recognize it.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.603
It's Hetty's house.

41:47.571 --> 41:49.639
What about the other addresses?

41:49.641 --> 41:50.740
We're still checking.

41:50.742 --> 41:51.808
The file was sold

41:51.810 --> 41:53.943
on Stewart's Chauvenet Web site.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.579
Somebody paid $250,000
