00:02.877 --> 00:04.043
These two men
are consultants--

00:04.128 --> 00:06.096
Peter Bishop
and Dr. Walter Bishop.

00:06.164 --> 00:08.732
You are looking through
a window into another world.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.384
An alternate Universe
just like ours.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.186
And in each of them,
there is a version of us.

00:13.271 --> 00:15.238

00:15.306 --> 00:17.574
Whatever's happening
between the two Universes,

I'm right at the center of it.

are inextricable.

00:31.739 --> 00:34.124
If one side dies,
we all die.

00:34.191 --> 00:35.792
So I've torn holes
in both the Universes,

00:35.860 --> 00:37.210

00:43.534 --> 00:45.368
How could they?
He never exited.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.237

doing, but his skin was...

over Agent Danzig,

08:11.201 --> 08:13.236
did you see anything
in his hands

08:13.320 --> 08:15.121

21:10.671 --> 21:12.004

21:18.178 --> 21:19.662
<i>Look, whatever it was,</i>

21:38.782 --> 21:42.618

21:42.703 --> 21:46.172
Well, that depends on your
definition of "all right".

21:46.239 --> 21:47.707
He's functional.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.408
Except when he's not.

21:49.460 --> 21:53.796
But he is often
quite brilliant.

21:53.881 --> 21:57.967
He just never had anything
to tether him to the world.

22:01.922 --> 22:04.607
That is sad.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.892
<i>What is?</i>

22:07.427 --> 22:09.979
I don't think
there's anything sadder

22:10.063 --> 22:12.648
than when two people
are meant to be together

22:12.733 --> 22:16.335
and something intervenes.

22:17.654 --> 22:18.771
Hey, Walter,
it's okay.

22:18.822 --> 22:21.874
It's okay.
It's just your test results.

22:27.247 --> 22:30.416
Question, dear.
That man?

22:30.484 --> 22:32.151
Agent Lee.

22:37.191 --> 22:40.159
I believe it was your idea,
Agent Lee,

22:40.227 --> 22:43.496
to test each of the victims
for iron-related diseases,

22:43.564 --> 22:45.765
that they may share
that in common.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.967
Very clever.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.537
Wrong, but clever.

22:51.605 --> 22:52.905
Well, it was
just a long shot.

22:52.973 --> 22:54.073
And yet, interestingly,

22:54.141 --> 22:55.908
they do all suffer
from a variety

22:55.976 --> 22:57.477
of health problems--

22:57.544 --> 22:59.912
gout, hair loss,
kidney diseases,

22:59.980 --> 23:03.149
which, in themselves,
have something in common.

23:03.217 --> 23:05.151
I'm not wearing pants.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.286
I'm on it.

23:09.690 --> 23:10.656
Which is what,
Walter?

23:10.724 --> 23:12.525
They're all caused
by some form

23:12.593 --> 23:13.926
of heavy metal poisoning.

23:13.994 --> 23:16.162
Lead, Zinc,
Mercury.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.263
Thank you, dear.

23:17.331 --> 23:19.098
And what
could that possibly mean?

23:19.166 --> 23:21.868
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but, with 30-odd victims,</i>

23:21.935 --> 23:23.603
it's unlikely
that it's a coincidence.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.971
And something else--

23:25.038 --> 23:27.139
the levels of metal
in their bodies

23:27.207 --> 23:28.374
have returned to normal.

23:28.442 --> 23:30.243
It's as if their blood
has been cleaned.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.410
So, what, you're saying

23:31.478 --> 23:32.778
he's taking particles
from their blood?

23:32.846 --> 23:35.281
Why?
For what possible reason?

23:35.349 --> 23:39.952
I don't have enough information
to form a hypothesis yet.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.857
But it would seem
he needs a lot of it.

24:33.874 --> 24:35.508
If Walter's right

24:35.576 --> 24:36.809
and we assume
that he is selecting

24:36.877 --> 24:38.311
these victims on purpose,
then the question is,

24:38.378 --> 24:40.446
how is he identifying them?

24:40.514 --> 24:43.182
In this case,
tissue's soft.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.551
No induration.

24:45.619 --> 24:49.121
Fat to lean muscle ratio--
ideal, about 20%.

24:49.189 --> 24:50.823
<i>Is that relevant?</i>

24:50.891 --> 24:52.625
To this case?
Not at all.

24:52.693 --> 24:54.126
<i>It just means</i>
<i>that she will make</i>

24:54.194 --> 24:55.695
<i>a lovely specimen.</i>

24:55.762 --> 24:57.229
Finding healthy tissue

24:57.297 --> 24:59.432
<i>for experimentation's</i>
<i>harder than you might imagine.</i>

24:59.499 --> 25:01.100
You mean you aren't returning
these people

25:01.168 --> 25:03.069
to their families?
 We can't do that.

25:03.136 --> 25:04.537
Why not?

25:04.605 --> 25:06.973
Because we can't disclose
how they were killed.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.176
The families are informed
that they have gone missing,

25:10.243 --> 25:11.544
that we will continue
to look for them--

25:11.645 --> 25:13.546
you mean you lie to them.

25:13.614 --> 25:15.114
Look, I'm sorry, but--

25:15.182 --> 25:16.482
You understand
what you're saying?

25:16.550 --> 25:18.651
Those families are going
to spend the rest of their lives

25:18.719 --> 25:21.354
wondering what happened
to their loved ones,

25:21.421 --> 25:24.357
looking for answers.

25:24.424 --> 25:27.627
Can you imagine
what that would be like?

25:27.694 --> 25:31.430
To have that...
that hole in your life.

25:36.570 --> 25:38.020
People die.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.072
It happens.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.608
Sometimes they even die twice.

25:45.862 --> 25:48.247
The reason
we can't return the bodies

25:48.314 --> 25:49.481
is because that would mean
we would have

25:49.533 --> 25:51.283
to file documentation,

25:51.335 --> 25:53.786
which would draw attention
to Fringe Division.

25:53.837 --> 25:55.538
And we cannot have that.

25:55.622 --> 25:59.742
It may not be a good enough
answer, but it is the truth.

25:59.843 --> 26:01.460
<i>Listen to this.</i>

26:03.496 --> 26:04.964
just registered a charge.

26:05.015 --> 26:07.216
Dead people do not use
their credit cards.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.434
Of course they do.

26:08.501 --> 26:09.518
Certainly.

26:09.603 --> 26:11.604
So you think
it's the translucent man?

26:11.671 --> 26:13.639
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you track it?

26:13.690 --> 26:16.308
Never mind.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.028
It's a false alarm.
It's a commuter pass

26:19.112 --> 26:21.847
<i>being auto-renewed</i>
<i>as a monthly charge.</i>

26:21.898 --> 26:23.032
The killer picked up
his last victim

26:23.116 --> 26:25.151
in the commuter rail
parking lot.

26:29.122 --> 26:30.623
We were wrong.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.124
Pattern's not random at all.

26:32.192 --> 26:33.492
Four kill zones,
all centered

26:33.543 --> 26:34.994
around the commuter
rail stations.

26:35.045 --> 26:36.295
Astrid, call Broyles.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.329
Lee, you come with me.

26:37.381 --> 26:38.864
Tell him to get
that photograph out

26:38.915 --> 26:40.532
to all the station police,
and also we're gonna need

26:40.584 --> 26:43.052
another three teams of agents
to watch the stations.

26:43.136 --> 26:44.253
Where are we going?

27:34.313 --> 27:36.498
<i>Team one, nothing to report.</i>

27:36.566 --> 27:39.334
<i>Team two, all quiet here too.</i>

27:39.419 --> 27:40.669
<i>Team three, same.</i>

27:40.754 --> 27:42.554
<i>No sign of the suspect.</i>

27:54.717 --> 27:58.187
Just so you know,

27:58.271 --> 27:59.638
I know what it's like.

28:03.109 --> 28:06.779
I lost a partner too.

28:06.846 --> 28:09.314
<i>About three years ago.</i>

28:11.502 --> 28:14.236
There was an event
on a plane.

28:14.237 --> 28:18.040
And at first we thought
it was terrorism.

28:18.124 --> 28:21.076
During the investigations,
my partner was injured.

28:23.079 --> 28:25.247
What happened to him
was horrific

28:25.331 --> 28:28.300
and unexplainable.

28:28.367 --> 28:31.570
It affected his skin.

28:31.638 --> 28:35.224
<i>Like your partner,</i>
<i>but different.</i>

28:35.291 --> 28:38.811
And Walter Bishop
was in a mental institution

28:38.878 --> 28:40.212
at the time.

28:40.263 --> 28:43.148
I checked him out,
so that he could help catch

28:43.216 --> 28:45.734
whoever did this and...

28:45.852 --> 28:49.438
and save my partner's life.

28:52.192 --> 28:55.828
But even Walter
couldn't save him.

29:03.536 --> 29:04.586
<i>This is Roach. We've got him.</i>

29:04.671 --> 29:06.288
<i>Grove Hall Station.</i>

29:08.074 --> 29:09.241
He's headed
for the industrial line,

29:09.292 --> 29:10.342
back by the chemical lab.

29:10.409 --> 29:11.793
I lost him.

29:11.878 --> 29:13.078
- I lost him.
- There.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.634
<i>He's running</i>
<i>toward the warehouse,</i>

29:18.718 --> 29:20.052
<i>through the rail lines.</i>

29:20.103 --> 29:21.770
<i>Copy. We're almost there.</i>

29:28.645 --> 29:30.595
What if he goes out
the other side?

29:30.647 --> 29:32.114
You take the near side--

29:32.198 --> 29:33.398
Frazier!

29:33.449 --> 29:35.367
<i>Frazier's down. Aagh!</i>

29:59.509 --> 30:00.676
He's been shot.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.127
He's gonna bleed out
if we don't get him help.

30:02.178 --> 30:04.179
All right, go.
Check the warehouse.

30:04.264 --> 30:06.064
If he's still here,
you don't let him get away.

30:06.132 --> 30:07.733
I got this.

30:36.879 --> 30:41.183
Don't move.

30:45.504 --> 30:47.556
Drop it.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.275
Drop--

31:45.114 --> 31:46.999
Hey.

31:47.066 --> 31:49.001
It took--
it's okay.

31:49.068 --> 31:50.285
You're okay.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.120
An ambulance
is on the way.

31:52.205 --> 31:53.955
It took my gun.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.573
It's okay.
It's all over.

31:55.625 --> 31:58.460
There's more than one.

32:20.099 --> 32:22.150
Unh!

32:52.849 --> 32:55.600
Who are these...Things?

32:55.685 --> 32:58.303
What were they looking for?

33:00.306 --> 33:04.276
I think the better question is,
what are they?

34:17.766 --> 34:19.567
Anything?

34:19.635 --> 34:22.536
Nothing that I can
make sense of.

34:22.605 --> 34:24.105
It's all too badly burned.

34:24.172 --> 34:26.507
<i>The spy who came in
from the cold.</i>

34:26.574 --> 34:30.578
We used to have the book
at St. Claire's.

34:30.646 --> 34:32.277
The mental hospital
where I lived for--

34:32.279 --> 34:35.147
<i>17 years.</i>

34:38.385 --> 34:40.219
What about the book,
Walter?

34:40.286 --> 34:41.887
We used to read it
every Wednesday.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.123
This reminds me
of the book.

34:44.190 --> 34:46.625
A spy burning his things,
covering his tracks.

34:46.693 --> 34:47.793
<i>Agent Lee.</i>

34:47.860 --> 34:49.462
Did you happen to bring
any candy?

34:49.529 --> 34:51.297
<i>Gumdrops perhaps?</i>

34:51.364 --> 34:54.099
Candy?
Um, no.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.068
That's a pity.

34:56.136 --> 35:01.307
Astrid,
where are the scalpels?

35:01.374 --> 35:03.809
Long drive.

35:03.877 --> 35:05.845
Hope the bureau's not gonna
give you a hard time

35:05.912 --> 35:09.081
about putting miles
on their car.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.417
I wanted
to thank you

35:11.485 --> 35:13.752
for releasing
Robert's body.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.988
I know you must have pulled
some...

35:16.056 --> 35:19.058
Significant strings.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.496
Why would you do that
for me?

35:26.600 --> 35:29.168
I know you haven't
found the answers

35:29.236 --> 35:31.270
you were looking for yet,

35:31.338 --> 35:33.272
but I hope that it brings

35:33.340 --> 35:35.341
a kind of closure,

35:35.408 --> 35:38.344
a closure
that he deserves.

35:38.411 --> 35:43.516
Because of what
he meant to you.

35:43.583 --> 35:46.035
Thank you.

35:46.102 --> 35:50.039
Well...
have a look at this.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.376
Does this remind you
of anything?

35:55.745 --> 35:59.948
A biological-mechanical hybrid.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.300
These are different.

36:01.384 --> 36:02.951
They're human.

36:03.003 --> 36:04.887
And for whatever reason,

36:04.954 --> 36:06.772
they don't work.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.023
Walter,
are you suggesting

36:08.091 --> 36:10.175
that these are--
- I told you.

36:10.260 --> 36:12.478
I told you that man
couldn't be trusted.

36:12.562 --> 36:14.813
What is he talking about?

36:14.898 --> 36:15.848
Walter, don't jump
to conclusions.

36:15.932 --> 36:17.433
We don't know that for sure.

36:17.484 --> 36:21.487
All I do know is that this tech

36:21.571 --> 36:22.638
isn't from here.

36:22.689 --> 36:23.972
<i>Not from here?</i>

36:24.024 --> 36:26.292
You mean like China?

36:26.359 --> 36:29.645
No.

36:29.696 --> 36:31.697
Not China.

36:36.536 --> 36:37.536
Sergeant,

36:37.621 --> 36:38.754
I need an I.D.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.155
<i>for Agent Lincoln Lee.</i>

36:40.206 --> 36:41.457
Yes, ma'am.

36:41.508 --> 36:43.959
Place your hand right here,
please, sir.

36:46.429 --> 36:47.379
Badge number.

36:47.464 --> 36:52.167
BMP122298.

36:52.218 --> 36:53.835
Blood type.

36:53.887 --> 36:56.188
Uh, B-Positive.

36:56.273 --> 36:57.673
Are you currently
on any medications?

36:57.724 --> 36:59.775
No.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.061
Do you have
a history of mental illness?

37:02.145 --> 37:03.946
This is getting
oddly personal.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.732
- But no.
- <i>Thank you, sir.</i>

37:10.987 --> 37:12.621
Thank you.

37:35.679 --> 37:36.812
Just wait.

37:40.984 --> 37:43.602
<i>Initiate scan.</i>

37:45.105 --> 37:46.438
What is this?

37:49.609 --> 37:52.911
<i>Please remain still.</i>

37:52.996 --> 37:58.900
What you said
before...

37:58.952 --> 38:02.571
I know what it's like
to have a hole in my life.

38:02.622 --> 38:05.541
It's been there as long
as I can remember.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.728
<i>I told you about the incident</i>
<i>on the plane.</i>

38:09.796 --> 38:13.716
After that, Broyles asked us
to join Fringe Division,

38:13.767 --> 38:18.520
and somehow I knew that
this is where I would find...

38:22.942 --> 38:25.277
What?

38:25.362 --> 38:27.563
<i>My answers.</i>

38:37.123 --> 38:39.508
What's beyond the door?

38:39.576 --> 38:43.712
Well, sometimes answers
lead to more questions.

39:28.425 --> 39:30.426
Heh.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.495
I hear you got something
to show me.

39:36.966 --> 39:38.217
What is it?

39:38.301 --> 39:40.686
It was powering
a new form of shapeshifters.

39:40.770 --> 39:43.021
<i>Shapeshifters?</i>

39:43.106 --> 39:45.023
<i>Human shapeshifters.</i>

39:45.108 --> 39:49.111
The ones we've encountered
before answered to Walternate.

39:49.178 --> 39:53.732
<i>You were wondering</i>
<i>why I don't trust you.</i>

40:02.075 --> 40:04.359
I'll look into it.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.550
- Night, Dr. Bishop.
- Night, Tommy.

40:44.617 --> 40:45.734
It's Tim, sir.

40:45.785 --> 40:47.452
Good night, Timmy.

40:50.507 --> 40:52.240
<i>Look how easy it is.</i>

40:54.210 --> 40:56.795
<i>I'm just gonna put it</i>
<i>in the center like this, okay,</i>

40:56.880 --> 40:58.297
<i>and slide it</i>
<i>all the way through.</i>

40:58.381 --> 41:00.015
<i>I'll put the platform</i>
<i>on here.</i>

41:00.082 --> 41:03.268
<i>I'll put the top on.</i>

41:03.353 --> 41:04.319
<i>And, as you can see...</i>

42:00.910 --> 42:03.478
<i>Anybody can do this.</i>

42:03.529 --> 42:05.981
<i>I'll put it in my machine</i>
<i>and...</i>

42:06.032 --> 42:08.116
<i>Set it and forget it!</i>

42:08.167 --> 42:11.370
<i>18 minutes a pound</i>
<i>for a pork loin roast--</i>

42:13.756 --> 42:16.174
<i>Oh! Aah!</i>

42:23.165 --> 42:24.349
I saw him again.

42:24.434 --> 42:25.968
The man.

42:26.019 --> 42:29.104
I saw him.
He was in the TV.

42:29.171 --> 42:30.856
<i>It was the man</i>
<i>from the mirror.</i>
