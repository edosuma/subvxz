you won't give us your name.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.549
I'm sure your prints

- Hey, man,

uh, I'm just going to holding,
right? I-I'm not convicted

00:12.221 --> 00:14.389
of anything? Is...

00:14.389 --> 00:16.517
Can I keep that on me?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.519

in about 45 minutes.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.216
It is completely

to make necessary adjustments

00:52.469 --> 00:55.973

Nothing here violates

00:58.392 --> 01:01.645
any rules or bylaws.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.230
I assure you.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.237
Excellent.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.365
Um, so, if you want
to take advantage

01:13.365 --> 01:16.493
of my unprecedented offer,

01:16.493 --> 01:20.289
there's a very specific way
you'll need to proceed.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.499
<i>ROLAND: Victor Suero
was just arrested in Brooklyn.</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:23.709
How long ago?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.002
Within the hour.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.587
What happened? Is he okay?

01:27.629 --> 01:28.714
He's in the 60th precinct.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.340
- Okay, let's go.
- Uh...

01:30.340 --> 01:31.717
We're coming down there
to bail him out.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.052
With what? Bail will be steep,

01:34.052 --> 01:36.471
and we've obtained a
civil forfeiture order freezing

01:36.471 --> 01:38.098
<i>that bank account of theirs</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:39.600
<i>until we can find out
where that money came from.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:40.934
We might not be able
to bail him out.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.479
- Let's just go.
- Just hang on a minute, okay?

01:44.479 --> 01:46.440
Okay, I'm gonna try
to find a place

01:46.440 --> 01:47.733
- to help me post bail.
- Fuck this.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.276
<i>Sure, if that's
what you want to do.</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:50.736
Can you give me the rundown

01:50.736 --> 01:53.113
- of a couple places to call?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:01.496

So,</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:03.081
according to your prints on file

02:03.081 --> 02:04.958
with the state
boxing commission,

02:04.958 --> 02:08.295
your name is Victor Suero,
is that correct?

02:08.295 --> 02:10.255
Yeah.
[door closes]

02:11.798 --> 02:13.258
JUDGE:
You've been charged with

02:13.258 --> 02:16.470
theft of a motorized vehicle--
namely, a boat--

02:16.470 --> 02:18.639
resisting arrest,
grand larceny.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.599
Judge, look, either
you lock me up in solitary

02:20.599 --> 02:22.935
or something where no one can
get me, huh? Or you let me go.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.686
You are not to address
the court unless the court

02:24.686 --> 02:25.854
addresses you.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.150
Now, I don't see legal counsel,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.528
so unless you can
afford your own,

02:32.528 --> 02:33.904
the state
will arrange for a lawyer

02:33.904 --> 02:36.406
to be provided free of charge.

Apologies for my tardiness.
New York traffic and all.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.295
A moment to confer
with my client?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.218
Do you know a Mr. Dupree?

02:56.218 --> 02:58.095
- He's my boss.
- Well, he's a good one

02:58.095 --> 03:00.305
because he's just taken care
of your bail.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.974
I'll have you out of here
in no time.

[dramatic music plays]

03:12.526 --> 03:14.987
If you don't mind me saying,
you're a bit jumpy.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.282
Had a hell of a day.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.369
[phone rings]

03:24.037 --> 03:26.081
I think you need
to answer that.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.421
How the hell is this
connected to your car?

03:32.421 --> 03:33.839
<i>MILES:
Hello, Victor.</i>

03:33.839 --> 03:36.466
<i>Congratulations on
having made it this far.</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:38.385
Further than many
who have come before you.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.429
You play with tenacity--

03:40.429 --> 03:42.472
something your friend Nixon

03:42.472 --> 03:45.142
<i>and I both appreciate.</i>

03:45.142 --> 03:46.643
<i>But something else we appreciate</i>

03:46.643 --> 03:51.231
is fidelity. Fidelity to
the rules. And you broke one

03:51.231 --> 03:52.482
<i>when you got yourself arrested.</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:53.859
No, no, no. I ran.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.445
Yeah, I'm well aware,
but rules are rules.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.781
Technically, you violated one
the moment you were handcuffed,

03:59.781 --> 04:01.992
ensuring the game will continue

04:01.992 --> 04:04.328
until your eventual death.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.122
That's where this fancy fuck's
taking me?

04:07.122 --> 04:08.373
To kill me?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.167
That is up to you.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.212
The rule exists so runners
don't intentionally

04:13.212 --> 04:17.049
get themselves incarcerated
to avoid hunters.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.717
No, you-you didn't do that.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.178
As you said, you ran.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.181
You violated
the letter of the law

04:24.181 --> 04:26.892
but not its spirit,
and for that reason

04:26.892 --> 04:29.978
<i>The Tiro Fund believes
you should be given options.</i>

04:29.978 --> 04:32.272
<i>Now, you could have Nixon</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:35.234
<i>pull over right now,
drop you off,</i>

04:35.234 --> 04:37.569
and you'd be hunted perpetually,

04:37.569 --> 04:39.821
as required by game canon.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.199
<i>And to make things more
equitable, there is a passport</i>

04:42.199 --> 04:45.077
<i>in the glove box with
a new identity and $5,000 cash.</i>

04:45.077 --> 04:47.329
<i>Get to an airport

04:47.329 --> 04:50.249
<i>get yourself overseas,

04:50.249 --> 04:53.001
<i>hope to God
never to be found out.</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:55.128
Though I don't know why
you would think another country

04:55.128 --> 04:56.630
is any safer than America.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.923
Look, our-our hunters

04:57.923 --> 05:00.968
are nothing if not persistent.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.678
The longest anyone ever lasted,

05:02.678 --> 05:04.930
I think, is 84 days,

05:04.930 --> 05:08.308
every moment of them
spent terrified,

05:08.308 --> 05:11.895
<i>looking over his shoulder,
until the day you look</i>

05:11.895 --> 05:14.147
and you see death approaching.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.984
What's behind door number two?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.611
Nixon will take you
to a location

05:19.611 --> 05:23.115
which I scrambled
to procure and prepare.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.243
There, you will
enter a room with him.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.871
You will move
to the far end of said room.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.164
<i>Nixon will stand in front
of the only means of escape--</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:33.166
<i>the door through which
you entered--</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:35.252
then you engage.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.795
<i>Nixon, of course, will have</i>

05:36.795 --> 05:39.298
<i>his usual in-game weaponry.</i>

05:39.298 --> 05:41.842
- Which is?
- Ah, tut-tut-tut-tut.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.011
<i>You'll find that out
when the time comes.</i>

05:44.011 --> 05:47.014
Now, if Nixon kills you,
well, game is over.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.766
<i>If you get through that door,</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:51.643
<i>your violation's forgiven</i>

05:51.643 --> 05:54.229
<i>and the game resumes immediately.</i>

05:54.229 --> 05:57.232
You've made it more than
halfway through this hunt.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.818
Make it to sunrise, and...

05:59.818 --> 06:01.695
you'll have unimaginable riches

06:01.695 --> 06:05.157
and the rest of your life
and Josie's life ahead of you.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.867
Even if I beat this guy,
as soon as

06:06.867 --> 06:09.870
I step outside that door,
there's gonna be other lunatics

06:09.870 --> 06:11.622
- waiting for me there.
<i>- No.</i>

06:11.622 --> 06:14.458
The other competitors
remain outside

06:14.458 --> 06:16.668
a four-square-mile perimeter,

06:16.668 --> 06:19.087
and upon your escape from Nixon,

06:19.087 --> 06:22.508
should it occur,
all three of them are released.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.927
- There's four left.
<i>- No, uh,</i>

06:24.927 --> 06:26.512
Tyler's deceased.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.430
Who the hell's Tyler?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.307
<i>The dog handler. Apparently</i>

06:30.307 --> 06:31.975
he drowned trying
to save his canine.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.977
Ironically, the dog
made it to shore.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.313
<i>If you escape</i>

06:36.313 --> 06:38.190
<i>and Nixon's still alive,</i>

06:38.190 --> 06:40.901
<i>he'll have to wait
one hour to pursue,</i>

06:40.901 --> 06:42.694
otherwise he's
right on your heels--

06:42.694 --> 06:44.655
where's the sportsmanship
in that?

06:45.697 --> 06:48.033
So, basically, I can

06:48.033 --> 06:50.410
get out of James Bond's car
right now

06:50.410 --> 06:51.912
and never see him again,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.122
but I have to be chased
by three killers

06:54.122 --> 06:55.791
for the rest of my life,

06:55.791 --> 06:59.086
or I walk into Thunderdome
and-and hope I walk out.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.297
A perfect summation.
I await your answer.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.590
Can I have a moment?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.717
Sure. You have ten seconds.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.812
Yeah, I'll fight
Prince Charles.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.566
[chuckles] I knew
you were the perfect choice.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.569
<i>See you soon.</i>
[phone beeps]

07:28.907 --> 07:31.326
So, how much you pay
for a shot to kill me?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.455
I received a discount
because the hunt's half over,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.250
but a gentleman never
discusses matters of money.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.297
You know, I have to say,
I didn't initially

07:43.297 --> 07:45.507
bid aggressively
on this particular hunt

07:45.507 --> 07:47.843
because I worried
your optical impairment

07:47.843 --> 07:49.845
would result in
a minimal challenge for me,

07:49.845 --> 07:52.848
but I see now that I was wrong.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.018
You're a warrior, Mr. Suero.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.770
I'm quite thrilled
with how things have played out.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.565
It will be a true honor
to either kill you

08:01.565 --> 08:03.275
or to die at your hand.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.572
We're going to be in the car
for quite a while.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.365
Enjoy the music.
