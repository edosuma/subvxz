WEBVTT

00:01.782 --> 00:03.666
Giddyup, giddyup!

00:03.751 --> 00:04.884
Meet Leslie Knope.

00:04.952 --> 00:06.152
Whap!

00:06.220 --> 00:07.520
I am the pants queen!

00:07.588 --> 00:09.172
Leslie loves whipped cream,

00:09.256 --> 00:10.557
dancing with friends,

00:10.624 --> 00:12.425
and working hard
for the Parks Department

00:12.476 --> 00:13.510
of Pawnee, Indiana.

00:13.577 --> 00:14.794
Cut it out, Tom.

00:14.862 --> 00:15.812
It never gets old.

00:15.896 --> 00:16.980
She also loves her coworkers

00:17.047 --> 00:18.348
at City Hall,

00:18.432 --> 00:21.100
Ron Swanson...

00:21.152 --> 00:22.402
Tom Haverford...

00:24.605 --> 00:25.522
Tommy Timberlake.

00:25.589 --> 00:26.656
April Ludgate...

00:26.740 --> 00:28.408
My mom's Puerto Rican.

00:28.475 --> 00:30.443
That's why I'm so lively
and colorful.

00:30.511 --> 00:32.695
And Andy Dwyer.

00:32.780 --> 00:33.847
Uh-oh.

00:33.914 --> 00:35.081
Nailed it.

00:35.148 --> 00:37.417
April and Andy like each other.

00:37.484 --> 00:39.018
But Andy accidentally kissed

00:39.086 --> 00:40.954
his ex-girlfriend,
Ann Perkins...

00:41.021 --> 00:42.088
Ooh.

00:42.155 --> 00:44.374
- April left.
- April!

00:44.458 --> 00:45.592
And he hasn't seen her since.

00:45.659 --> 00:47.260
In the midst of all this love,

00:47.328 --> 00:49.629
two black hats rode
into town...

00:49.697 --> 00:51.231
Scientists believe
that the first human being

00:51.298 --> 00:52.332
who will live 150 years

00:52.399 --> 00:54.167
has already been born.

00:54.235 --> 00:55.802
I believe I am
that human being.

00:55.853 --> 00:59.189
And they brought with them
some disturbing news.

00:59.273 --> 01:00.340
Effective tomorrow morning,

01:00.407 --> 01:01.741
the entire government
will be shut down

01:01.809 --> 01:03.142
until further notice.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.211
What will Leslie do next?

01:05.279 --> 01:08.481
Will April and Andy
make up and make out?

01:08.549 --> 01:10.450
Find out this season
on <i>Parks and Recreation.</i>

01:10.517 --> 01:12.085
Starting right now.

01:17.241 --> 01:21.294
Ron...We're back.

01:21.361 --> 01:22.378
Bully.

01:22.463 --> 01:23.930
The bankrupt government
of Pawnee

01:23.998 --> 01:26.299
has been shut down all summer,

01:26.366 --> 01:27.634
so it's been three months
of no work,

01:27.701 --> 01:30.220
no meetings, no memos,
no late nights, nothing.

01:30.304 --> 01:31.804
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

01:31.872 --> 01:33.890
Oh, rounding up the team.

01:33.974 --> 01:35.475
So exciting.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.761
I have goosebumps.
Feel.

01:38.829 --> 01:41.447
And that's why they call me
Prince Charming.

01:41.515 --> 01:42.749
'Cause I always find
the glass slipper

01:42.816 --> 01:44.067
for my Cinderella.

01:44.151 --> 01:45.418
These are way too tight.

01:45.486 --> 01:47.320
Well, the real Cinderella
didn't have hippo feet.

01:47.387 --> 01:48.571
Tom, we're back.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.824
Jeremy!
Suck it!

01:51.892 --> 01:53.293
By the way, I've been
giving away free sports bras

01:53.360 --> 01:55.929
to the girls
at hot dog on a stick.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.730
Look, we can dance all day,

01:57.798 --> 01:58.998
but it's time to step up.

01:59.066 --> 02:01.367
Are you buying
4,000 rubber nipples from me

02:01.418 --> 02:03.286
or not?

02:03.370 --> 02:04.454
Dee, you have a visitor.

02:04.538 --> 02:05.788
We back?

02:05.873 --> 02:06.906
We're back.

02:06.957 --> 02:07.907
All right.

02:11.211 --> 02:12.795
- Jerry.
- Oh, my gosh.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.347
Look who's here.
Leslie.

02:14.414 --> 02:16.266
The nightmare's over, Jerry.
We're going back to work.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.102
You're not gonna need
this anymore.

02:20.420 --> 02:21.804
Come on!

02:24.692 --> 02:27.226
I called shotgun.
Everybody heard me.

02:30.264 --> 02:39.864
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:47.881 --> 02:48.831
Well...

02:48.916 --> 02:52.051
I am usually not one
for speeches.

02:52.119 --> 02:53.052
So good-bye.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.637
Break's over, mofos.

02:54.722 --> 02:55.722
Okay, here's the situation.

02:55.789 --> 02:58.007
We are operating
on a shoestring budget.

02:58.092 --> 03:00.226
Park services
have been slashed.

03:00.293 --> 03:02.512
But we are all still here.

03:02.596 --> 03:04.063
And we have a job to do.

03:04.131 --> 03:06.649
Make the world's biggest pizza.

03:06.734 --> 03:08.101
No, make this town fun

03:08.152 --> 03:09.402
for the people who live here.

03:09.470 --> 03:10.403
Fine, but after that,

03:10.470 --> 03:11.821
the pizza is our top priority.

03:11.905 --> 03:13.072
No, it's not.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.657
We're getting pizza?

03:14.742 --> 03:17.994
April, hey.
It's me, Andy.

03:18.078 --> 03:19.479
Dwyer.

03:19.546 --> 03:22.415
Uh, this is, like,
the 200th message I've left you

03:22.482 --> 03:24.050
without a response.

03:24.118 --> 03:25.201
So...

03:25.285 --> 03:27.620
If you're trying
to tell me something,

03:27.688 --> 03:29.422
I do not know what it is

03:29.489 --> 03:31.858
because you won't call me back.

03:31.925 --> 03:33.893
It is truly great
to see all of you.

03:33.961 --> 03:35.428
Huh?

03:35.496 --> 03:36.996
It's great news.

03:37.064 --> 03:39.499
Okay, I have to run.
Ben.

03:39.566 --> 03:42.568
The bad news, which...

03:42.636 --> 03:44.871
I get to deliver, is this:

03:44.938 --> 03:46.506
Your only work
for the time being

03:46.573 --> 03:48.841
will be existing
park maintenance.

03:48.892 --> 03:50.009
So that just means

03:50.077 --> 03:51.010
that we're in maintenance mode!

03:51.078 --> 03:52.445
Yeah!

03:52.513 --> 03:54.397
Jerry.

03:54.481 --> 03:56.215
Okay, see, I've spent
the last few months

03:56.283 --> 03:57.233
brainstorming,

03:57.317 --> 03:58.234
and I have
some really great ideas,

03:58.318 --> 03:59.852
and I put them
in my idea binders.

03:59.903 --> 04:01.521
I mean, they're color-coded,
for God's sake.

04:01.588 --> 04:02.622
Okay, actually, yeah.
There is...

04:02.690 --> 04:04.374
There is one thing
that you will be doing.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.792
Apparently, in Indiana,

04:05.859 --> 04:07.293
if you don't provide
a basketball league,

04:07.360 --> 04:08.711
people get very upset.

04:08.779 --> 04:10.763
And, quite frankly,
throw things at you

04:10.831 --> 04:12.365
and call you names.

04:12.433 --> 04:14.267
Like turd boy.
I... whatever.

04:14.334 --> 04:16.502
Point is, I reinstated
youth basketball.

04:16.570 --> 04:18.254
It says here you only have
money for two teams.

04:18.338 --> 04:20.589
Yeah, they're gonna develop
a great rivalry.

04:22.476 --> 04:24.177
Under my tutelage,
you will grow

04:24.228 --> 04:25.545
from boys into men.

04:25.612 --> 04:28.147
From men into gladiators.

04:28.215 --> 04:31.401
And from gladiators
into Swansons.

04:31.485 --> 04:33.436
Behold.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.822
The Swanson pyramid
of greatness.

04:35.889 --> 04:38.658
I've been developing
the Swanson pyramid of greatness

04:38.726 --> 04:39.759
for years.

04:39.827 --> 04:42.078
It's a perfectly
calibrated recipe

04:42.162 --> 04:44.063
for maximum personal
achievement.

04:44.131 --> 04:45.865
Categories include:

04:45.933 --> 04:48.117
Capitalism, God's way
of determining

04:48.202 --> 04:50.203
who is smart, and who is poor.

04:50.254 --> 04:53.206
Crying, acceptable at funerals

04:53.273 --> 04:54.607
and the Grand Canyon.

04:54.675 --> 04:57.143
Rage, poise, property rights.

04:57.211 --> 04:59.262
Fish, for sport only.

04:59.346 --> 05:00.513
Not for meat.

05:00.581 --> 05:02.298
Fish meat is practically
a vegetable.

05:02.382 --> 05:03.299
Haircuts.

05:03.383 --> 05:04.416
There are three
acceptable haircuts.

05:04.468 --> 05:06.085
High and tight,

05:06.153 --> 05:08.488
crew cut, buzz cut.

05:08.555 --> 05:10.923
Are the scissors broken
in your house, son?

05:10.991 --> 05:13.126
So you happy
to be back at work?

05:13.193 --> 05:15.194
Well, our budget's
been slashed to zero.

05:15.262 --> 05:16.779
I tried to buy fertilizer
the other day

05:16.864 --> 05:17.930
for the soccer field.

05:17.998 --> 05:19.482
Request denied.

05:19.566 --> 05:21.234
We literally can't buy shit.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.002
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, I mean, look.

05:23.070 --> 05:24.303
When we were kids,

05:24.371 --> 05:26.472
the Parks Department
would do these big projects.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.742
Winter Jamboree,
the Harvest Festival.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.878
It's like they don't have faith
in us anymore.

05:31.945 --> 05:33.546
I'm not a paper-pusher,
Ann.

05:33.613 --> 05:35.047
I need to be out
in the streets,

05:35.115 --> 05:36.615
planting trees
and cracking skulls.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.518
Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins.

05:38.585 --> 05:40.619
How are my two favorite people
in this entire town?

05:40.671 --> 05:41.838
Not good, Chris.

05:41.922 --> 05:43.289
There's a whole line of people
in my office

05:43.340 --> 05:44.357
complaining that
all their programs

05:44.424 --> 05:45.675
have been slashed.

05:45.759 --> 05:46.893
Yeah, I know.
It's terrible.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.896
Is there anything
we can do about that?

05:49.963 --> 05:50.997
- No.
- Damn, sorry, Leslie.

05:51.064 --> 05:52.965
Ann, could I talk to you
for a minute?

05:56.503 --> 05:58.371
- So how's it going?
- Save it, okay?

05:58.438 --> 06:00.406
I know you don't have
faith in me

06:00.474 --> 06:01.741
and my department,
and that's fine.

06:01.809 --> 06:03.042
But don't expect me to sit here

06:03.110 --> 06:04.410
and chit-chat with you.

06:04.478 --> 06:06.045
All right, fair enough.

06:06.113 --> 06:07.180
Go the other way.

06:07.247 --> 06:09.348
But I'm just going to that...

06:09.416 --> 06:10.917
All right, uh...

06:10.984 --> 06:12.919
Look, I'm very flattered.

06:12.986 --> 06:13.920
But again, I don't think

06:13.987 --> 06:15.588
I should go out with you.

06:15.655 --> 06:17.156
Can I ask you why not?

06:17.224 --> 06:18.324
Because I thought
we had a great time

06:18.392 --> 06:20.493
the night you got drunk
and kissed me.

06:20.561 --> 06:22.929
And you did use your tongue.

06:22.996 --> 06:24.764
I just don't think
I'm in a place

06:24.831 --> 06:26.699
to go out with anyone
right now.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.167
Okay, well,

06:28.218 --> 06:29.185
if you change your mind,

06:29.269 --> 06:30.720
you know where
to find me, Ann Perkins.

06:30.804 --> 06:32.338
Leslie Knope.

06:32.389 --> 06:34.307
Yes.
Did he ask you out again?

06:34.358 --> 06:36.192
He did, he did.

06:36.276 --> 06:38.394
He is nothing
if not persistent.

06:38.478 --> 06:40.146
And hot.

06:40.197 --> 06:42.215
He's ver...
he's pretty hot.

06:42.282 --> 06:43.232
Yeah, he's hot.

06:43.317 --> 06:44.400
But he's intense.

06:44.484 --> 06:45.785
But he's really, really hot.

06:45.853 --> 06:46.903
But he's your boss.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.454
Oh, my God,
I just thought of an idea

06:48.522 --> 06:49.855
of how we can save
the Parks Department.

06:49.907 --> 06:51.190
Great.

06:51.241 --> 06:52.291
Let me ask you one question.

06:52.359 --> 06:54.126
Would you be cool doing things

06:54.194 --> 06:55.194
that a prostitute does?

06:55.262 --> 06:56.963
Uh...

06:57.030 --> 06:58.197
Minus the money.

06:58.265 --> 07:00.416
Definitely yes, then.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.601
Thanks, Ann.

07:01.668 --> 07:03.586
Looking sharp.
Beautiful.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.471
The backboard is your friend.

07:07.007 --> 07:08.774
Aaaa, bam!

07:08.842 --> 07:10.142
Boom!

07:10.210 --> 07:12.929
I'd say my coaching style
is centered

07:13.013 --> 07:14.247
around fundamentals,

07:14.314 --> 07:15.481
with an emphasis on fun.

07:15.549 --> 07:17.233
Hey, watch this.

07:17.317 --> 07:18.901
Go get it!

07:18.986 --> 07:22.421
And a second emphasis
on mental.

07:22.489 --> 07:24.156
Yeah, it can be hard work,

07:24.224 --> 07:25.157
but every time I look

07:25.225 --> 07:26.893
one of these kids in the eyes

07:26.960 --> 07:29.395
and he calls me coach...

07:29.446 --> 07:32.615
That's how I know
I agreed to be a coach.

07:32.683 --> 07:34.233
Mouse rat!

07:34.284 --> 07:36.669
Carnage!

07:36.736 --> 07:38.254
Okay, gentlemen, it's time

07:38.338 --> 07:40.406
for the pregame coin toss.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.241
There's no coin toss
in basketball.

07:42.292 --> 07:43.626
Are those women's sneakers?

07:43.710 --> 07:45.411
Yes, they are, Ron.
You know what?

07:45.479 --> 07:47.964
They fit better.
I got an employee discount.

07:48.048 --> 07:48.981
And the best part is,

07:49.049 --> 07:50.349
no one can tell.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.251
All right, let's do this.

07:52.319 --> 07:55.254
Match point,
touchdown, et cetera.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.108
Yeah, go my team.
All right.

07:59.176 --> 08:00.526
Okay, I like
what you're wearing,

08:00.593 --> 08:02.528
but I need it to be
300% sexier.

08:02.596 --> 08:03.763
Do you have any of those shirts

08:03.830 --> 08:05.698
that look wet all the time?

08:05.766 --> 08:06.933
Or... or, like,
a metal bikini?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.567
Oh, you know what's
always sexy?

08:08.635 --> 08:10.102
Fingerless gloves.

08:10.170 --> 08:13.205
What about if I wear
this normal, sane outfit?

08:13.273 --> 08:14.273
Yeah, okay,
but you're gonna have to eat

08:14.341 --> 08:15.958
something sexy, then,
like a banana.

08:16.043 --> 08:17.159
For dinner?

08:17.244 --> 08:18.244
Well, what's sexy food?

08:18.295 --> 08:19.545
Asparagus?

08:19.612 --> 08:20.830
No, you know what's sexy?

08:20.914 --> 08:22.748
Turkey chili.

08:22.816 --> 08:24.283
- Mmm.
- Yum.

08:24.351 --> 08:25.751
And how, exactly,

08:25.819 --> 08:28.821
am I supposed to casually steer
the conversation

08:28.889 --> 08:30.623
towards the Parks
Department budget?

08:30.691 --> 08:31.991
Okay, it's totally easy.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.859
Tell you what.
You be Chris.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.594
I'll be you.
I'll show you how it's done.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.812
Okay.

08:36.897 --> 08:38.030
Ann Perkins.

08:38.097 --> 08:39.565
You are wonderful and amazing,

08:39.633 --> 08:40.967
and I'm happy
to be here with you.

08:41.034 --> 08:41.967
Thank you, Chris.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.203
I'm wearing a tuxedo vest

08:44.270 --> 08:46.155
with no shirt on underneath.

08:46.239 --> 08:47.306
Uh-oh.

08:47.374 --> 08:48.507
Can I get you a drink?

08:48.575 --> 08:50.526
I love every single beverage
in the world.

08:50.610 --> 08:52.078
I would like some wine.

08:52.145 --> 08:54.914
And, oops, my vest popped open.

08:54.982 --> 08:57.750
Just like the budget
needs to pop open,

08:57.818 --> 08:59.885
and you need to pour it

08:59.953 --> 09:01.854
into my Parks Department.

09:01.922 --> 09:03.522
Great.

09:03.590 --> 09:06.625
I am so excited
that you finally agreed

09:06.677 --> 09:07.994
to go out with me.

09:08.061 --> 09:09.762
What a magnificent
flip-flop.

09:09.830 --> 09:13.332
You're a magnificent
asker-outer.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.868
Tell me every single detail
of your day.

09:15.936 --> 09:17.570
I love dates.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.171
I love connecting with someone.

09:19.222 --> 09:20.940
I love engaging them.

09:21.008 --> 09:23.042
I love being surprised by them.

09:23.110 --> 09:24.543
I have never had a bad date.

09:24.611 --> 09:27.246
They've all been either great
or phenomenally great.

09:27.314 --> 09:29.615
Nurses are the most
undervalued members

09:29.683 --> 09:31.350
of our society by far.

09:31.418 --> 09:33.619
I think all of you
should make as much money

09:33.687 --> 09:34.620
as the CEO of Google.

09:34.688 --> 09:38.090
Wow, thank you.
I agree.

09:38.158 --> 09:39.709
Can I ask you a question?

09:39.793 --> 09:41.027
Why am I so positive
all the time?

09:41.094 --> 09:45.131
Yes, that's exactly
the question.

09:45.198 --> 09:47.099
I was born
with a blood disorder.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.534
And my parents were told

09:48.585 --> 09:50.202
that I had three weeks to live.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.204
And here I still am,

09:52.255 --> 09:55.541
some 2,000-odd weeks later.

09:55.592 --> 10:01.180
And I have enjoyed
every one of them.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.681
I think it's going well.

10:02.749 --> 10:05.017
He's actually
a really nice guy.

10:05.085 --> 10:06.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:06.353 --> 10:07.520
Okay, so have you asked him
yet about the money?

10:07.571 --> 10:08.771
Well, it's a date, you know?

10:08.855 --> 10:10.089
It's kind of hard
to casually bring up

10:10.157 --> 10:11.257
the Parks budget
when you're talking

10:11.324 --> 10:12.441
about your favorite movies.

10:12.526 --> 10:15.745
<i>Jurassic Park,</i>
parks are so great,

10:15.829 --> 10:17.029
the Parks Department
needs money.

10:17.097 --> 10:18.247
I just did it in three moves.

10:18.331 --> 10:19.331
Well, then, why don't you
just come here

10:19.399 --> 10:20.332
and do it yourself?

10:20.400 --> 10:21.534
- Okay.
- Holy crap.

10:22.626 --> 10:25.493
What? Chris and Ann?
What are you two doing here?

10:25.512 --> 10:26.529
We are on a date.

10:26.845 --> 10:28.630
And it is going phenomenally.

10:28.714 --> 10:30.214
Thanks, but I'll stay
for just one drink.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.183
I'm so happy I ran into you

10:32.251 --> 10:33.751
because I wanted
to speak to you...

10:33.819 --> 10:36.220
- Well, well, well.
- Ben.

10:36.272 --> 10:38.306
- What a fun surprise.
- Oh, that's right.

10:38.390 --> 10:40.058
You were coming here tonight
on a date.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.126
And, hey, Leslie is joining you

10:42.194 --> 10:44.445
on this wonderfully
romantic occasion.

10:44.530 --> 10:45.863
How 'bout that?

10:45.931 --> 10:47.532
- Fantastic.
- It is.

10:47.599 --> 10:48.866
Can I talk to you?

10:48.934 --> 10:50.201
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

10:50.269 --> 10:51.703
I'm just confirming
a suspicion I had, Leslie.

10:51.770 --> 10:52.837
What are you talking about?

10:52.905 --> 10:54.155
I had nothing to do
with this date.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.373
- Uh-huh.
- They're both so beautiful.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.841
They probably just want
to see each other naked.

10:56.909 --> 10:58.276
Okay, well, I know
what you're trying to do.

10:58.344 --> 10:59.644
And you're not that good
at being sneaky.

10:59.712 --> 11:01.462
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

11:01.547 --> 11:03.064
- I'm great at being sneaky.
- Clearly you're not.

11:03.132 --> 11:04.215
Hey, you guys.

11:04.283 --> 11:06.250
Let's all have dinner together.

11:06.318 --> 11:07.685
The more the merrier.

11:07.753 --> 11:09.687
- Great.
- Great.

11:09.755 --> 11:11.689
Good job, guys.
Yep.

11:11.757 --> 11:12.790
All right, Eric, taking a rest,

11:12.841 --> 11:14.092
or are you hurt?

11:14.143 --> 11:16.010
Taking a rest?

11:16.095 --> 11:17.428
Smart.

11:17.479 --> 11:18.479
Destroy them, gentlemen.

11:18.564 --> 11:21.632
Feel no sympathy.

11:21.700 --> 11:25.570
Yes, Ron Swanson is dating
my ex-wife, Wendy.

11:25.637 --> 11:27.572
Big deal.

11:27.639 --> 11:28.573
My girlfriend, Lucy,

11:28.640 --> 11:30.074
is the sexiest woman in town.

11:30.142 --> 11:31.676
She's Cuban, she's got tattoos,

11:31.744 --> 11:33.044
and she's into me,

11:33.112 --> 11:34.362
which, as far as I'm concerned,

11:34.446 --> 11:37.115
is the sexiest quality
a woman can have.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.316
Oh, I have an idea.

11:38.384 --> 11:40.051
You know what would be
really fun after dinner?

11:40.119 --> 11:42.253
We should take a walk
by the pond in Ramsett Park.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.855
Walking in parks can be
very romantic.

11:43.922 --> 11:45.923
Yeah, too bad the park's
always closed, though.

11:45.991 --> 11:47.859
Okay, well,
you two are on a date.

11:47.926 --> 11:52.180
So Leslie and I
should probably get going.

11:52.264 --> 11:54.015
Uh, well, I'm actually
having a good time

11:54.099 --> 11:55.016
with everyone.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.718
Chris?

11:56.802 --> 11:58.369
Oh, me, too.
I'm having a fantastic time.

11:58.437 --> 11:59.370
What do you say we take
this whole

11:59.438 --> 12:00.872
date-plus-two-
other-people thing

12:00.939 --> 12:02.056
up into the stratosphere?

12:02.124 --> 12:03.408
♪ Don't stop make it pop ♪

12:03.475 --> 12:05.777

12:10.649 --> 12:12.066
Great call, Leslie Knope.

12:12.151 --> 12:13.084
Thanks.

12:13.152 --> 12:15.720
Look, even Ben's dancing.

12:17.990 --> 12:19.323
That's the way
to shoot the ball, Chignoli.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.324
Hustle back.

12:24.963 --> 12:26.764
Uh...

12:26.832 --> 12:27.899
It's a foul.

12:27.966 --> 12:29.584
What?
On whom?

12:29.668 --> 12:30.618
Your team.

12:30.686 --> 12:32.737
Number 50.
He was double dribbling.

12:32.805 --> 12:33.738
He's on defense.

12:33.806 --> 12:35.623
Exactly.

12:35.691 --> 12:36.908
It's a technical difficulty,
so that means

12:36.975 --> 12:38.559
Andy's team throws the ball

12:38.644 --> 12:39.710
from the stripey thing.

12:39.778 --> 12:40.728
Let's go.

12:40.813 --> 12:42.597
The stripey thing?

12:45.451 --> 12:49.270
♪ ♪

12:49.354 --> 12:50.938
Hey, there.

12:51.023 --> 12:52.556
How's it going?

12:52.608 --> 12:54.592
Great, thanks.

12:54.660 --> 12:55.576
Can I buy you a drink?

12:55.661 --> 12:58.329
Oh, I'm very flattered,

12:58.396 --> 13:00.281
but this is my
stunningly gorgeous date,

13:00.365 --> 13:01.299
Ann Perkins.

13:01.366 --> 13:03.134
Oh, hi.

13:03.202 --> 13:05.086
- Hi.
- Sorry.

13:05.170 --> 13:06.537
Oh, no problem.

13:06.588 --> 13:08.623
In fact, let me buy
all of you a drink

13:08.707 --> 13:09.957
for being so welcoming today.

13:10.042 --> 13:11.092
Waiter.

13:11.176 --> 13:16.481
I think I may
actually like Chris.

13:16.548 --> 13:17.682
On the house, Leslie.

13:17.749 --> 13:19.967
Oh, thank you.

13:20.052 --> 13:21.953
I'm sort of a gay hero.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.755
Last year, I married
two penguins at the zoo,

13:24.823 --> 13:25.957
and it turned out
they were both gay.

13:26.024 --> 13:27.525
- Penguin wedding.
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.592 --> 13:30.311
- That's cute.
- It was so cute.

13:30.395 --> 13:31.562
But enough about how
cute it was.

13:31.630 --> 13:32.864
Why don't you think
I should have the money?

13:32.931 --> 13:34.599
Good lord, really?

13:34.666 --> 13:35.950
Look.

13:36.034 --> 13:37.168
When I was 18,

13:37.236 --> 13:40.171
and I became mayor
of my hometown,

13:40.239 --> 13:41.839
I used every last dollar we had

13:41.907 --> 13:44.108
to open a giant
winter sports complex.

13:44.176 --> 13:45.376
Called it Icetown.

13:45.444 --> 13:46.811
And it turned out great,
and everyone loved it.

13:46.879 --> 13:47.812
Uh, yeah, kinda.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.180
It was never completed,

13:49.248 --> 13:51.382
and I got impeached.

13:51.450 --> 13:52.517
Newspaper headline was,

13:52.584 --> 13:55.853
"Icetown costs ice clown
his town crown."

13:55.921 --> 13:56.888
Yuck.

13:56.955 --> 13:58.823
They were big into rhymes.

13:58.891 --> 14:00.424
Well, I don't know.

14:00.476 --> 14:01.659
I think Icetown sounds great.

14:01.727 --> 14:02.960
And the point is,

14:03.028 --> 14:05.513
at least you tried something.

14:07.299 --> 14:08.983
Foul!

14:09.067 --> 14:10.318
Foul on number three

14:10.402 --> 14:12.019
for taking a number two
on number four.

14:14.406 --> 14:15.472
Roughing the passer.

14:15.524 --> 14:16.991
Double dribbling.
That's a foul.

14:17.075 --> 14:19.076
That's a foul for touching
the basketball.

14:19.144 --> 14:20.244
What are you gonna do about it?

14:20.312 --> 14:21.412
Nothing.
You fouled.

14:21.479 --> 14:22.547
You can't do anything.

14:22.614 --> 14:24.165
Okay.

14:24.249 --> 14:25.366
You're ejected.
You're ejected.

14:26.985 --> 14:28.920
Oh, what's the matter
there, Ron?

14:28.987 --> 14:29.921
No players left?

14:29.988 --> 14:32.657
Yay, Andy's team!

14:32.724 --> 14:34.325
- Look at 'em go!
- Come on.

14:34.376 --> 14:36.511
Now you're openly
cheering for the other team?

14:36.578 --> 14:38.262
- Put my boys back in.
- You made me the ref.

14:38.330 --> 14:39.347
Deal with it.

14:39.431 --> 14:40.698
You know what?
Take this uniform off.

14:40.766 --> 14:42.667
- Hey, hey.
- You don't deserve to wear it.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.736
Ron's ejected
for molesting the ref.

14:45.804 --> 14:46.837
Oh, yeah?
I'm ejected?

14:46.889 --> 14:47.855
- Yes, you are.
- Tom, what are you doing?

14:47.940 --> 14:49.173
I'm ejecting you.

14:49.224 --> 14:50.841
You're ejected, too.
Everyone's ejected.

14:50.893 --> 14:51.842
Oh, yeah?
She's ejected?

14:51.894 --> 14:52.843
Yeah.

14:52.895 --> 14:57.532
Rrrraaaagh!

14:57.616 --> 14:59.584
Go ahead, go.

14:59.651 --> 15:01.619
Well, that's a forfeit.
Andy's team wins.

15:01.687 --> 15:02.787
No way!

15:02.854 --> 15:05.072
We won!
Oh, man!

15:05.157 --> 15:06.924
Eat it!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

15:06.992 --> 15:09.427
Andy, Andy, Andy!

15:09.494 --> 15:11.546
Yeah!

15:11.630 --> 15:13.798
Ah-ha-ha!
Yes!

15:13.865 --> 15:15.733
I dedicate this victory
to April Ludgate.

15:15.801 --> 15:16.734
It feels good.

15:16.802 --> 15:19.337
And it feels sticky.

15:19.404 --> 15:21.088
From the Gatorade.

15:21.156 --> 15:22.840
We're barely able to function.

15:22.891 --> 15:25.142
We could really use that money.

15:25.210 --> 15:26.677
But you know,
I don't know if it's because

15:26.745 --> 15:28.212
I'm in such a good mood,

15:28.280 --> 15:29.614
or because of the charming
Ann Perkins,

15:29.681 --> 15:31.515
but I am going
to seriously consider that.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.517
Really?
That's great.

15:33.585 --> 15:34.518
Mission accomplished.

15:34.570 --> 15:35.753
Let's boogie.

15:35.821 --> 15:36.954
Mission accomplished?

15:37.022 --> 15:40.191
Uh-oh.

15:40.242 --> 15:41.425
Yeah.

15:41.493 --> 15:45.363
There's a mission, uh,
that Ann had thought of.

15:45.414 --> 15:46.397
It was both of our ideas,

15:46.465 --> 15:47.765
but it was mostly Ann's.

15:47.833 --> 15:49.951
We...

15:50.035 --> 15:51.953
I had mentioned to Ann
that it would be fun

15:52.037 --> 15:53.404
if you two went on a date.

15:53.472 --> 15:54.505
So then...

15:54.573 --> 15:57.258
You could, uh,
talk about the money

15:57.342 --> 16:01.512
and then, you know,
maybe give it to me.

16:01.579 --> 16:04.215
Wow.

16:04.283 --> 16:08.286
I've just had
my first bad date.

16:08.353 --> 16:10.388
Ann Perkins.

16:13.091 --> 16:16.127
Not that sneaky.

16:24.978 --> 16:26.345
April!

16:29.116 --> 16:30.032
April.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.650
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.

16:31.702 --> 16:33.486
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm okay.

16:33.553 --> 16:34.653
I'm dying to see you.

16:34.705 --> 16:37.773
I called and texted you,
like, a billion times.

16:37.841 --> 16:40.226
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:40.293 --> 16:41.260
I was in Venezuela.

16:41.328 --> 16:43.162
Oh, really?

16:43.230 --> 16:44.330
Wow.

16:44.381 --> 16:46.749
Across the pond.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.267
Wow.

16:48.335 --> 16:49.435
I thought maybe
I woulda heard from you

16:49.503 --> 16:53.055
at least once
because of what happened.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.473
Ann kissing me?
I'm so sorry about that.

16:54.541 --> 16:55.591
It was so stupid,

16:55.675 --> 16:57.410
and it meant nothing.

16:57.477 --> 17:00.563
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

17:00.647 --> 17:02.064
Hey.

17:02.149 --> 17:04.817
This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.

17:04.885 --> 17:06.185
No, it's not.

17:06.252 --> 17:08.686
- <i>¿Listo para lonche?</i>
<i>- Si.</i>

17:08.739 --> 17:10.256
That means we're going
to lunch.

17:10.323 --> 17:12.023
How do you say
have a great time,

17:12.075 --> 17:13.025
don't choke on anything?

17:13.076 --> 17:14.193
Bye.

17:17.998 --> 17:19.865
Leslie asked me
to do her a favor,

17:19.915 --> 17:22.867
and I love her, so I did it.

17:22.919 --> 17:25.371
I'm sorry, and I'm here
to eat crow.

17:25.439 --> 17:26.872
I like you a lot.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.908
Let's go out again.

17:31.011 --> 17:34.680
Ann Perkins.

17:34.748 --> 17:37.099
Budget solution number 28.

17:37.184 --> 17:41.937
Use grazing sheep
to mow grass in parks.

17:42.022 --> 17:45.858
Note: Tired sheep
could become food

17:45.926 --> 17:47.393
or sweaters.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.297
Well, I got my answer.

17:51.364 --> 17:52.665
About April.

17:52.732 --> 17:54.033
She hates me.
Yeah.

17:54.101 --> 17:56.101
And she got a boyfriend,
I guess,

17:56.153 --> 17:57.570
from some city in Mexico.

17:57.637 --> 17:59.271
So...

17:59.322 --> 18:01.307
What do I do?

18:01.374 --> 18:02.541
Okay.

18:02.609 --> 18:04.310
Well, when your back's
against the wall

18:04.377 --> 18:07.413
and odds are stacked
against you,

18:07.481 --> 18:09.281
you just...
you...

18:09.332 --> 18:11.117
You swing the hardest, damn it.

18:11.184 --> 18:12.468
You go big, or you go home.

18:12.552 --> 18:14.753
And you don't seem like
the kind of guy who goes home.

18:14.821 --> 18:16.255
I'm not.

18:16.306 --> 18:17.389
I don't even really
have a home.

18:17.457 --> 18:18.891
- Go get her, Andy!
- Okay.

18:18.958 --> 18:21.093
Okay, thanks, Leslie!

18:24.231 --> 18:26.432
Okay, so we know the people
who run this government

18:26.500 --> 18:27.500
have no faith in us.

18:27.567 --> 18:28.967
My plan is gonna change that

18:29.019 --> 18:30.503
and bring the budget back.

18:30.570 --> 18:31.837
And the answer's been
right in front of us

18:31.905 --> 18:32.822
the whole time.

18:32.906 --> 18:34.857
Ew, check your testicles?

18:34.941 --> 18:35.908
No, not that.

18:35.976 --> 18:37.409
Although that is
very good advice.

18:37.477 --> 18:38.410
I'm looking at you, Jerry.

18:38.478 --> 18:39.678
No, what's gonna save us

18:39.746 --> 18:43.249
is right there.

18:43.316 --> 18:44.850
Gentlemen, I realize
that times are tough,

18:44.918 --> 18:46.585
and the budget is tight.

18:46.653 --> 18:49.455
But if the people of this town
have nothing else to do

18:49.523 --> 18:52.191
but sit in their houses
and play video games,

18:52.259 --> 18:54.493
then Pawnee will die.

18:54.561 --> 18:57.763
And we refuse
to let that happen.

18:57.831 --> 18:59.882
Now.

18:59.950 --> 19:02.051
This town was historically
known for two things.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.271
Widespread obesity

19:05.338 --> 19:09.058
and the annual
Pawnee Harvest Festival.

19:09.142 --> 19:10.910
People from all over Indiana
would come

19:10.977 --> 19:12.244
and gaze in wonderment

19:12.312 --> 19:13.812
at how fat our citizens were.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.030
And while they were here,

19:15.115 --> 19:16.582
they would also attend
the festival.

19:16.650 --> 19:19.051
A full week of corn mazes,

19:19.119 --> 19:20.870
hayrides, ferris wheels,

19:20.954 --> 19:22.821
pumpkins the size of jeeps.

19:22.889 --> 19:25.858
We lost that festival
a few years ago,

19:25.926 --> 19:27.393
due to another round
of budget cuts.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.763
And I propose
we bring the festival back.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.698
With ticket sales
and corporate sponsorship,

19:32.749 --> 19:33.999
we'll earn all that money back.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.334
And believe me,
people will come.

19:35.402 --> 19:36.835
What if they don't?

19:36.903 --> 19:39.805
Well...

19:39.872 --> 19:42.141
Then you eliminate
the Parks Department.

19:42.209 --> 19:44.777
And you guys are all
on board with this.

19:44.844 --> 19:46.412
- Aye.
- Yes.

19:46.479 --> 19:48.614
Look, we're not
just pencil pushers.

19:48.682 --> 19:51.817
We are a reflection
of the community.

19:51.884 --> 19:55.321
And we believe that we can
strengthen that community.

19:55.388 --> 19:57.323
Because in the end,

19:57.390 --> 20:00.025
the reason why we're all here

20:00.093 --> 20:02.828
is to bring people together.

20:02.896 --> 20:06.032
♪ ♪

20:06.375 --> 20:07.375
That...

20:07.443 --> 20:09.544
Literally...

20:09.612 --> 20:12.814
Is the most moving thing
I've ever heard.

20:12.882 --> 20:16.985
And a good idea.

20:17.052 --> 20:17.986
Yeah, all right.

20:18.037 --> 20:19.320
Excellent.

20:19.388 --> 20:21.406
Great, okay, so everybody,

20:21.490 --> 20:22.857
we're gonna party hard
for 15 minutes.

20:22.908 --> 20:26.327
Then we're gonna have
our first brainstorming session.

20:30.956 --> 20:31.956
Hello, April.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.124
Do you like the flowers?

20:34.192 --> 20:35.543
What are you doing?

20:35.627 --> 20:37.361
All due respect, Eduardo.

20:37.412 --> 20:38.829
You seem like a great guy.

20:38.897 --> 20:40.564
But I like April,
and I'm coming after her

20:40.632 --> 20:42.616
with everything I've got.

20:42.684 --> 20:44.602
So do you want
to go out with me?

20:44.669 --> 20:47.688
No.

20:47.772 --> 20:48.906
I thought you were gonna
say yes,

20:48.974 --> 20:49.974
but that's okay.

20:50.091 --> 20:51.859
Because I'll be back tomorrow
to ask you again.

20:51.927 --> 20:53.761
And again the next day.

20:53.829 --> 20:54.945
And the next day.

20:55.030 --> 20:55.946
Not Friday.

20:56.031 --> 20:57.064
I have to go visit my cousin.

20:57.115 --> 20:58.616
But I will be back after that

20:58.700 --> 21:00.101
to ask you again.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.169
[...]

21:04.479 --> 21:07.357
[...]

21:07.933 --> 21:09.379
[...]

21:09.611 --> 21:12.680
Ah! You should do it.

21:12.748 --> 21:14.615
Uh, follow you dream.

21:14.683 --> 21:16.817
Oh, my God.
Really?

21:16.885 --> 21:17.818
That's awesome.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.088
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:21.156 --> 21:25.258
