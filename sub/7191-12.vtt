- So you're saying
that you and Mia

17:55.908 --> 17:56.909
are meant to be together?

17:56.992 --> 17:59.745
- No, I'm just--

17:59.828 --> 18:01.413
It's just a lot
to process, okay?

18:01.497 --> 18:02.664
I gotta run.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.875
I'm gonna be late
for class.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.168
- With no one else
he's meant to be.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.669
Diego only has eyes of me.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.594
- Isn't it "only has
eyes <i>for</i> me"?

18:15.677 --> 18:17.888
- Does it really matter?

18:17.971 --> 18:19.264
- Oh, by the way, Maddie,
I gotta tell you--

18:19.348 --> 18:19.681
- [gasping]

18:19.765 --> 18:21.517
- What?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.270
- Uh...
nothing.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.689
- I guess it does matter.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.818
- Okay, this'll work.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.612
Just, just talk to your dad
through the bathroom door,

18:33.695 --> 18:35.489
and make up an excuse why you
can't go to the interview.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.199
EMMA: Like what?

18:37.282 --> 18:40.536
- Well, I started you off
with giant puss-filled zits.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.870
So just go down that road.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.955
EMMA: I guess I don't have
any other choice--

18:43.038 --> 18:45.082
- What--what's wrong?

18:45.165 --> 18:48.669
Uh, I'm sure it's nothing...
I--

18:48.752 --> 18:50.546
Look, Em...

18:50.629 --> 18:53.549
Uh, Emma? Emma!

18:53.632 --> 18:55.134
Emma.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.389
- Everything okay?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.890
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.935
There was just some--some bees.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.438
- Andi, you were supposed to
be getting Emma.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.816
- Yeah, I was.

19:10.899 --> 19:14.361
Okay.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.697
- Well, I think you should
grow your hair out.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.242
It's more...musician-y.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.910
- Maybe, but um...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.704
Emma likes it short.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.539
- Is she still mad at you for
sticking up for me?

19:25.622 --> 19:26.999
- I don't know.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.792
It's just been hard with us.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.545
I thought it was
going well but then...

19:31.628 --> 19:33.547
- The spider seal.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.883
Have I said how sorry I am?

19:35.966 --> 19:36.383
- Only a million times.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.265
I just can't believe how
willing she is to believe Jax

19:43.348 --> 19:47.227
after he betrayed
all of us last year.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.896
- Well, maybe you're
seeing Emma's true colors,

19:48.979 --> 19:50.480
and you're growing apart.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.817
- Maybe.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.153
No, wait, what am I saying?

19:56.236 --> 19:57.237
No--what!

19:59.072 --> 20:01.825
I know exactly who did this!

20:01.909 --> 20:04.244
Had to be a spell.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.287
- Wait, where are you going?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.538
- To find Jax!

20:09.416 --> 20:11.084
[door opening]

20:11.168 --> 20:13.629
- Hang on a sec, Mr. Alonso,
I'll go get Emma.

20:16.506 --> 20:16.840
[imitating Emma]
Dad?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.009
- Em?

20:19.092 --> 20:20.135
Are you all right?

20:20.218 --> 20:22.346
- [as Emma]
Yeah, I'm just...

20:22.429 --> 20:23.889
waiting for the hives
to go away.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.725
- You sound strange.

20:26.808 --> 20:29.686
- Uh, it's the hives.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.729
They're making my
throat all scratchy.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.565
[choking cough]

20:33.649 --> 20:34.608
- Well, do you need me
to take you to the doctor?

20:34.691 --> 20:37.402
- No!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.821
Andi checked me out already.
She said I'll be fine.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.782
- Emma, Emma,
we've talked about this.

20:41.865 --> 20:45.577
It doesn't matter how many of
her relatives are doctors.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.372
Andi is not a doctor.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.082
- [normal voice]
What? That's way harsh!

20:50.165 --> 20:51.333
- What?
- [as Emma] Andi...

20:51.416 --> 20:53.168
My dad's right.
You are not a doctor.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.337
[as herself]
You know what, good luck

20:55.420 --> 20:57.881
asking me for medical advice
from now on.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.758
[as Emma]
Don't worry, I won't.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.301
[as herself]
Oh, you better not!

21:01.385 --> 21:03.804
FRANCISCO: Okay, the two of you,
just stop fighting

21:03.887 --> 21:05.472
and come out of the bathroom.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.265
- [as Emma]
Uh, okay, Dad.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.978
I'll go straight to your office
as soon as Andi apologizes.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.604
[as herself, gasping]
Never!

21:12.688 --> 21:14.022
- Okay, that's it.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.900
Emma, come out right now or...

21:16.984 --> 21:18.360
I'm coming in.

21:29.079 --> 21:29.871
- I know them.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.583
The witches council.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.088
In the nurse's office.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.298
Clever.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.884
I wonder what goodies
they have stashed in here.
