00:32.917 --> 00:34.334
How are you, ma'am?

00:34.417 --> 00:36.834
You're only visiting the school now?

00:36.917 --> 00:40.626
- After 29 years.
- What year did you graduate?

00:40.709 --> 00:44.126
1980 or '81. Or '82.

00:44.209 --> 00:46.376
What took you so long?

00:46.501 --> 00:49.376
I tried to live my roller-coaster life.

00:49.501 --> 00:53.167
- What do you mean?
- I became a band singer.

00:53.251 --> 00:56.376
- So you sing well, I suppose.
- Not really.

00:56.501 --> 00:59.001
- What's the name of your band?
- Journey.

00:59.084 --> 01:01.251
- Journey.
- Journey.

01:01.334 --> 01:04.876
- It's an American band.
- International band.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.959
Here, Amy, please take a picture.

01:09.084 --> 01:11.917
- What's your name again?
- Arnel, Arnel Pineda.

08:10.251 --> 08:15.209
I started uploading the videos
on March 3, 2007.

08:15.292 --> 08:17.626
I didn't have a computer at that time.

08:17.709 --> 08:20.251
I'd be at the internet café
until early in the morning,

08:20.334 --> 08:22.501
uploading all night
because it was so slow.

08:25.292 --> 08:30.334
Every session was four to six hours,
or eight hours, until closing time.

08:30.417 --> 08:33.292
I uploaded around 60 videos.

08:34.708 --> 08:39.001
If not for Noel Gomez,
his persistence and his belief,

08:39.083 --> 08:42.626
his fairy-tale belief,

08:42.708 --> 08:48.834
his dream that one day I will be famous.

08:48.917 --> 08:52.667
Hey, wake up, that's not real.

08:58.501 --> 09:02.917
And then, after a few months,
I got the email from Neal Schon.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.792
I called Arnel.

09:09.876 --> 09:13.751
"Nel, I think it's the break
we've been waiting for."

09:21.501 --> 09:23.667
But I gave in to Noel. He said,

09:23.751 --> 09:31.376
"For our friendship's sake,
answer him just this once."

09:31.501 --> 09:34.792
"I have a feeling about this."

09:34.876 --> 09:38.209
We were doing laundry at the time.

09:38.292 --> 09:42.209
Then this man called, a foreigner.

09:42.292 --> 09:45.376
Arnel said, "Are you really Neal Schon?"

09:45.501 --> 09:49.959
"No, I am Neal Schon. Believe me, man."

09:50.001 --> 09:53.209
Then I overheard something
about an audition.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.042
Arnel kept laughing,
he didn't want to believe.

11:05.834 --> 11:08.751
So many uncertainties
were brewing in my heart.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.292
I had so many doubts.

11:13.876 --> 11:19.334
The fatigue and excitement
got the best of me.

11:55.709 --> 11:58.626
You can see on Neal's face

11:58.709 --> 12:03.667
his faith in me didn't fade.

12:23.292 --> 12:27.334
Actually,
I had a very uncomfortable feeling.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.792
So this was what they wanted,
the legacy sound.

12:30.876 --> 12:34.334
How will my real self come out?

12:34.417 --> 12:38.501
But I thought, if that's what they want,
I'll just do my job.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.584
I was convinced I did not do well.

13:57.667 --> 14:01.417
I was thinking,
at least I was with them.

14:01.542 --> 14:05.167
They signed the album that I treasured

14:05.251 --> 14:07.292
so I was OK.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.001
Neal picked me up from the hotel

14:17.042 --> 14:22.334
and, from the lobby,
he yelled it out to me, the good news.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.042
I got the gig

14:44.417 --> 14:48.584
But I still didn't believe.
Me? A member of Journey?

14:48.667 --> 14:50.167
How could it be?

14:51.251 --> 14:52.792
Are you sure? Why me?

14:52.876 --> 14:57.209
There are tons of people
who are good. Why me?

15:04.667 --> 15:08.584
...If you picture it, my God, it's like
I was just edited in, you know.

15:08.667 --> 15:14.126
I was just placed there using Adobe
Photoshop. Look, I'm with Journey.

15:14.209 --> 15:16.501
I was shocked.

18:18.251 --> 18:21.792
There are people out there
who just want me to fail,

18:21.876 --> 18:24.584
who just want me to falter, to lose it.

18:24.667 --> 18:29.001
So they will have justification
of whatever kind of words

18:29.042 --> 18:30.751
they accused against me.

18:32.417 --> 18:36.584
They would call me "monkey", "garbage",

18:36.667 --> 18:41.292
"an impersonator", "a karaoke boy".

18:43.417 --> 18:47.334
If I will take it seriously,
I'll get hurt. It's not going to end.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.792
I will answer back
and then they will answer back.

18:49.876 --> 18:53.376
And they love it, the attention
that I'm going to give to them.

18:53.501 --> 18:57.334
They're just diehard fans
who got so used with,

18:57.417 --> 18:59.959
you know, Steve Perry's voice.

19:01.042 --> 19:05.001
And I have no argument about that.

19:05.084 --> 19:08.792
I'm also a very big fan of Perry.

19:09.501 --> 19:12.501
From where they are coming from,
I understand.

19:14.417 --> 19:18.501
He's really got one of the most
beautiful voices I have ever heard.

19:22.959 --> 19:26.501
I'm sticking to those people
who believe in me.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.001
I was nervous.

21:37.667 --> 21:41.626
I was prepared. I practised a lot.
I was confident.

21:41.709 --> 21:44.209
We practised for two weeks
and I didn't lose my voice.

21:48.667 --> 21:53.126
But the evening of the performance

21:53.209 --> 21:57.584
I started hearing 18,000 people
were attending.

21:57.667 --> 22:01.126
18,000? Wow, that's a lot.

22:02.876 --> 22:04.876
Then I heard the people.

22:06.417 --> 22:09.001
The thunderous applause.

22:09.042 --> 22:11.501
How will I face them all?

22:23.042 --> 22:28.709
I started being terrified.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.334
I got weak.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.334
The tips of my fingers
were getting numb.

22:34.417 --> 22:38.376
My breath became faint.

22:39.251 --> 22:42.584
Neal kept asking if I was OK.
"Are you OK?"

22:42.667 --> 22:45.792
I'm fine. My lips were trembling.

22:45.876 --> 22:48.292
You know that kind of fear?

22:54.876 --> 22:58.167
You know the vertigo feeling?

22:58.251 --> 23:01.584
I'm on the edge of the cliff.

23:01.667 --> 23:04.334
Someone can just tap me and...

23:04.417 --> 23:06.001
I'd fall off.

23:12.417 --> 23:15.334
You know in the movies
when suddenly everyone's silent?

23:15.417 --> 23:18.292
Everything stops
and goes into slow motion.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.792
Even my heartbeat was like that.

23:24.876 --> 23:27.334
Slower.

23:27.417 --> 23:31.001
Then I told Neal Schon,

23:31.042 --> 23:36.167
"Neal, can I just go home?"

23:40.251 --> 23:43.084
Then I felt my face was doing this.

23:45.876 --> 23:49.584
Then I heard, "Here they are,
the band you've been waiting for

23:49.667 --> 23:53.417
for almost 20 years!
Finally, they're here!"

23:58.501 --> 24:01.917
When the show started,
it suddenly became real to me.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.917
Then an adrenaline shot.

24:06.251 --> 24:09.501
Three hundred miles per hour!

24:10.667 --> 24:12.042
Then it became faster.

24:48.667 --> 24:51.501
I was sharp here, I was flat there.

24:51.584 --> 24:54.834
And then I was thinking of moves
I had to make.

24:54.917 --> 24:58.167
Is this right what I'm doing?
Is this jump OK?

25:39.251 --> 25:43.167
It was sheer energy,
sheer happiness, and nerves.

25:43.251 --> 25:47.001
Wow, I'm in concert with Journey.

25:47.042 --> 25:49.167
Wow, I'm dead if I mess this up.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.667
Before I knew it, it was over.

25:55.751 --> 25:57.751
Fifteen songs, that's it.

26:15.584 --> 26:17.792
I felt drunk and high.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.417
I didn't understand that
they were giving us an award.

26:20.542 --> 26:22.917
I just kept screaming,
"I love you, Chile!"

27:04.709 --> 27:07.001
He said that I shouldn't have done that.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.334
I should just stand in the middle
and sing.

27:09.417 --> 27:13.792
Journey is about singing

27:13.876 --> 27:18.501
not about jumping and dancing on stage.

27:20.042 --> 27:24.626
I took it in a professional manner.

27:24.709 --> 27:28.001
I hadn't really proven myself to them

27:28.042 --> 27:30.584
that I can really last,

27:30.667 --> 27:34.001
that they can really depend on me
the whole tour, I can finish it.

27:34.042 --> 27:37.792
So I was cool. I accepted it.

27:37.876 --> 27:41.292
But deep inside, I was down-hearted.

35:30.667 --> 35:34.001
Life was never easy.

35:35.876 --> 35:38.334
We came from a very poor family.

35:38.417 --> 35:42.751
My mother and father
were both simple tailors.

35:44.042 --> 35:47.834
This is the house. Here.

35:49.417 --> 35:52.667
The first 12 years.
So many memories. Too much.

35:52.751 --> 35:56.959
When it would rain, it would flood,
and there were motor boats.

35:57.001 --> 35:59.292
And the flood is up here.

36:13.417 --> 36:17.292
My mother had rheumatic heart disease.

36:25.042 --> 36:27.876
It really spun out of control.

36:32.042 --> 36:36.584
We had sold our TV, the refrigerator,

36:36.667 --> 36:40.792
the furniture, just to keep her alive.

36:40.876 --> 36:46.584
Then we could no longer afford
to rent our apartment.

36:46.667 --> 36:52.084
We were six months behind on our rent.

36:52.167 --> 36:55.292
So they literally kicked us out.

36:58.042 --> 37:04.001
There were so many uncertainties
during that time.

37:04.584 --> 37:08.042
Hunger. Confusion.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.334
Anger.

37:13.876 --> 37:21.251
I was trying to understand it all
at a very young age.

37:27.667 --> 37:29.792
And then I told my father,

37:29.876 --> 37:33.709
"OK, you can go your own way,
and then I'll go my own way."

37:49.876 --> 37:53.001
I would tag along just so I could eat.

37:53.042 --> 37:56.709
Sometimes, we would go to a burial.

37:56.792 --> 38:01.376
We would sing there
and they'd give us biscuits and coffee.

38:01.501 --> 38:03.042
Just to survive.

38:10.167 --> 38:16.501
We would go to the park to sleep with
the other homeless kids. You know.

38:25.209 --> 38:28.584
We had to be distributed
among our relatives.

38:28.667 --> 38:33.501
I lived with my mom's sister.

39:08.876 --> 39:12.126
We saw each other again after one year.

39:12.209 --> 39:15.292
Arnel was the one
who brought us back together.

39:17.876 --> 39:20.251
I was around 12 years old

39:20.334 --> 39:23.334
and my father arrived at my aunt's house
and he said,

39:23.417 --> 39:28.167
"Arnel asked me to fetch you
because he found a place to stay."

39:28.251 --> 39:31.334
He was singing with a band.
"Oh, really?"

39:31.417 --> 39:37.292
Finally, his singing on street corners
finally paid off.

39:41.042 --> 39:43.834
The place we lived in

39:43.917 --> 39:46.584
was a very tiny room.

39:46.667 --> 39:48.792
Five of us in there.

39:48.876 --> 39:52.126
The minute you entered,
that's where we slept.

39:56.417 --> 40:00.292
In a sense, he'd scream all night

40:00.376 --> 40:03.584
just to earn 50 pesos a night.

40:03.667 --> 40:09.042
He'd save it and give it to us
so we can eat.

40:09.126 --> 40:14.251
Arnel was the bread winner
after Mama died.

42:51.626 --> 42:54.167
Jonathan. I'll be tenor tonight.

42:54.251 --> 42:56.501
On the third day, I'll be baritone.

44:57.542 --> 45:02.001
The proper way of using your vocal cords
makes them last much longer.

45:02.042 --> 45:05.167
It was the first time I learned to do it
after 25 years.

45:05.251 --> 45:09.876
I got another lease.

45:09.959 --> 45:15.626
I could prolong my voice
another 15 years.

49:10.417 --> 49:14.584
- Since Perry, right?
- Resurged Journey fans

49:14.667 --> 49:17.709
that didn't want to know about
anything else, brother.

58:57.876 --> 59:03.167
I went a little crazy
in the early years of my career.

59:03.251 --> 59:11.251
I just had fun with friends,
singing cover songs up on stage

59:11.334 --> 59:16.042
being adored by the audience
because you sang it perfectly.

59:17.417 --> 59:20.001
Then there were the love affairs

59:20.042 --> 59:25.001
and the drugs and just hanging out.

59:25.042 --> 59:27.501
I just went with the flow.

59:30.417 --> 59:33.334
I only started to have

59:33.417 --> 59:39.584
the urge, the desire
to be known as an original artist

59:39.667 --> 59:47.584
when my relationship ended with
my first live-in partner, Wendy.

59:48.126 --> 59:51.959
I had enough experiences, enough pain,

59:52.001 --> 59:56.626
to put on paper.

59:56.709 --> 59:59.959
That's when I started writing.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.584
I was sober for a while.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:07.084
Then my serious relationship
started falling apart.

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:09.584
I was married to her.

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:15.792
Another very depressing chapter
of my life.

01:00:15.876 --> 01:00:21.001
Then I went back to drugs.
I went back to drinking.

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:26.084
I'd lock myself in my room,
but I was writing. I wrote a lot.

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:19.167
But eventually, I met Cherry.

01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:22.792
By the time I met him,
he had very few gigs.

01:01:22.876 --> 01:01:27.001
Maybe once a week, twice a week.
He was also drinking a lot.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:30.001
He had gone through his savings.

01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:34.167
Hoping that one day
the songs I wrote will be heard

01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:38.834
the fruit of drugs
and alcohol and tears.

01:01:46.751 --> 01:01:51.334
We approached a lot of people
to listen to my songs.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:53.709
But still nothing happened.

01:01:56.667 --> 01:02:03.001
At the time, the audience
didn't think I had any talent.

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:08.126
They only wanted cover songs.

01:02:08.209 --> 01:02:12.376
They couldn't appreciate my other side.

01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:48.001
I was broken-hearted.

01:02:48.042 --> 01:02:51.167
After 25 years, I just didn't make it.

01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:56.167
I was on the verge of giving up
my recording career.

01:02:56.251 --> 01:03:01.292
Then, suddenly I got this call from
Neal Schon, and here we are.

01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:20.167
- Where did you see it, hon?
- On Youtube.

01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:23.334
Shoreline. What was I singing?

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:27.084
- "When You Love a Woman. ”
- Was it good?

01:11:13.959 --> 01:11:16.251
Arnel, I see Steve Perry every day.

01:11:17.876 --> 01:11:21.084
No, I mean it seriously.
He lives in Hollywood, where I work.

01:13:15.876 --> 01:13:20.917
I'm the guy who replaced Peter Cetera
in Chicago, Jason Scheff.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:32.167
The bottom line is what will make you
happy is, at the end of the day,

01:17:32.251 --> 01:17:35.292
is your family intact, happy.

01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:41.334
And then looking for a better day.

01:17:41.417 --> 01:17:44.084
You know, sunshine.

01:17:45.876 --> 01:17:49.917
You can't have it all, really.

01:17:52.876 --> 01:17:57.334
Somehow, somewhere,
there really is a compromise.

01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:03.876
The performance
is really my consolation.

01:18:07.042 --> 01:18:12.792
The noise when
they're so excited about the song

01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:15.126
sometimes it sounds like a world war.

01:22:53.876 --> 01:22:57.126
- It's like winning the lotto.
- The lotto is pure luck.

01:22:57.209 --> 01:23:00.292
Yours starts with talent.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:45.542
It's a different persona.
It's a different Arnel.

01:23:45.626 --> 01:23:47.917
It's all very simple.

01:23:58.251 --> 01:24:02.376
It's like everything that happened
was a dream.

01:24:10.667 --> 01:24:16.292
Those... those converted haters...

01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:20.084
Suddenly they love Journey again.

01:24:21.209 --> 01:24:26.167
It's like one big Earth
that I held in my hands.

01:24:26.251 --> 01:24:29.042
They just all played around in my head.

01:25:09.417 --> 01:25:12.251
There'll be problems.
Problems will arise.

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:29.959
When you come from our new house,
these places look so small now.

01:25:32.417 --> 01:25:36.001
I often go back and forth.

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:40.292
When I come here, everything looks small
and nothing looks nice.

01:25:42.292 --> 01:25:45.751
But when we used to walk around here,
I used to point to one of these houses

01:25:45.834 --> 01:25:48.376
and think as long as I have
one of those, I'll be happy.

01:25:48.501 --> 01:25:52.126
I still think that way.

01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:54.376
I don't want to get spoiled.

01:25:54.501 --> 01:26:00.334
It's hard to get spoiled
with too much excess.

01:26:00.417 --> 01:26:07.709
It's harder to be on top and then fall.

01:26:09.876 --> 01:26:12.917
As opposed to coming
from the bottom and rising.

01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:50.501
It's always here.

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:03.167
There's more opportunity now
to commit a sin.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:06.167
Because it's just there.

01:27:06.251 --> 01:27:09.167
But with drugs,
I have more tolerance to resist.

01:27:09.251 --> 01:27:14.709
It's really more the women
who go around.

01:27:14.792 --> 01:27:19.417
You have to pray hard
that you don't get hit.

01:27:26.501 --> 01:27:29.292
I tell myself, if you do it, you know...

01:27:41.417 --> 01:27:46.001
You work so hard to have
a complete family, a happy one.

01:27:46.042 --> 01:27:51.584
Then you go back to a broken family.

01:27:51.667 --> 01:27:54.792
There will be hatred,

01:27:54.876 --> 01:27:59.667
anguish, regrets, blame.

01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:27.834
We made a promise to each other

01:28:27.917 --> 01:28:31.334
that no matter what happen,
no one lets go.

01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:32.959
We'll fight together.

01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:37.584
It will never last with
a different kind of woman.

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:40.959
Others don't understand
his world is really different.

01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:43.792
It's full of temptations.

01:29:51.251 --> 01:29:54.126
- How are you doing, Arnel?
- So excited.

01:33:31.042 --> 01:33:35.709
It's heavy. It's all too heavy.

01:33:44.876 --> 01:33:47.209
You're right.
