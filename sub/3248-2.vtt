00:06.330 --> 00:07.580
Ancient Rome.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.463
Well, not to them, obviously.

00:12.498 --> 00:15.282
To all intents and purposes,
right now, this is Brand New Rome.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.649
Oh, my God, it's...

00:18.732 --> 00:20.288
It's so Roman!

00:21.552 --> 00:22.956
This is fantastic.

00:26.357 --> 00:27.808
I'm here,

00:28.687 --> 00:31.951
in Rome,
Donna Noble, in Rome.

00:32.807 --> 00:34.350
This is just weird.

00:34.561 --> 00:36.322
- I mean, everyone here's dead
- Well,

00:36.898 --> 00:38.105
don't tell THEM that.

00:38.685 --> 00:39.633
Hold on a minute,

00:40.231 --> 00:41.850
that sign over there's in English.

00:42.369 --> 00:43.899
Are you having me on, are we in Epcot?

00:43.934 --> 00:46.029
No, no no, it's TARDIS
translation circuits,

00:46.145 --> 00:48.030
it looks like English
Speech as well,

00:48.340 --> 00:50.306
- you're talking Latin right now
- Seriously?

00:50.567 --> 00:52.496
- I just said 'seriously' in Latin.
- Yeah.

00:53.918 --> 00:56.351
What if I said something in actual Latin?

00:57.039 --> 00:59.768
Like, 'Veni, vidi, vici'? My dad said
that coming back from the football.

00:59.803 --> 01:03.197
If I said, 'Veni, vidi, vici' to that
lot, what would it sound like?

01:03.232 --> 01:05.420
I'm not sure. You do think of
difficult questions.

01:06.013 --> 01:07.082
I'm gonna try it.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.526
Afternoon, sweetheart,
what can I get you, my love?

01:12.112 --> 01:14.341
Erm... Veni, vidi, vici.

01:15.033 --> 01:15.991
Ah? Sorry?

01:17.204 --> 01:21.407
Me-no-speak-Celtic.
No-can-do, missy.

01:21.932 --> 01:23.012
Yeah.

01:24.493 --> 01:26.446
- How's he mean, Celtic?
- Welsh

01:26.775 --> 01:27.749
You sound Welsh.

01:28.516 --> 01:29.623
There we are, learnt something, hm?

01:35.885 --> 01:37.520
Don't our clothes look a bit odd?

01:38.022 --> 01:39.572
Naaah. Ancient Rome, anything goes.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.671
It's like Soho, but bigger.

01:42.272 --> 01:43.527
- Have you been here before, then?
- Mm.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.129
Ages ago.

01:45.177 --> 01:47.726
And that fire had nothing to do with me.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.943
Well... a bit. But I haven't got
the chance to look around properly.

01:51.462 --> 01:53.627
The Colosseum. The Pantheon.

01:53.659 --> 01:54.877
The Circus Maximus...

01:55.674 --> 01:57.753
You'd expect them to be looming by now.

01:58.654 --> 01:59.565
Where is everything?

02:01.215 --> 02:02.305
Try this one.

02:14.547 --> 02:15.729
I'm not expert,

02:17.021 --> 02:18.912
but there's SEVEN hills of Rome,
aren't there?

02:20.051 --> 02:21.246
How come they've only got one?

02:23.442 --> 02:24.414
Here we go again!

02:28.929 --> 02:30.008
Wait a minute...

02:30.817 --> 02:32.133
One mountain.

02:32.433 --> 02:33.854
With smoke.

02:34.069 --> 02:36.020
- Which makes this...
- Pompeii.

02:36.947 --> 02:38.260
We're in Pompeii

02:39.732 --> 02:41.268
And it's volcano day.

03:29.091 --> 03:32.115
I beg audience with the High
Priestess of the Sibylline.

03:32.121 --> 03:34.538
The High Priestess cannot be seen.

03:41.156 --> 03:43.895
- What would you tell her, sister?
- It has come.

03:44.430 --> 03:46.223
As foretold in the prophecy.

03:46.714 --> 03:47.813
The box.

03:48.109 --> 03:49.528
The blue box.

04:05.349 --> 04:06.888
You're kidding.

04:07.076 --> 04:09.813
- You're not telling me the TARDIS has gone?
- OK.

04:10.362 --> 04:11.406
Where is it, then?

04:12.024 --> 04:13.779
You told me not to tell you.

04:14.744 --> 04:16.492
- 0i. Don't get clever in Latin.
Hold on.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.123
'Scuse me, 'scuse me,

04:20.158 --> 04:22.423
there was a box, big blue box,
big blue wooden box,

04:22.441 --> 04:24.185
over there,
where is it gonne?

04:24.732 --> 04:27.119
- I sold it, didn't I?
- But...

04:27.925 --> 04:30.365
- It wasn't yours to sell!
- It was on my patch, weren't it?

04:30.400 --> 04:33.124
I got 15 sesterce for it, lovely jubbly.

04:33.159 --> 04:35.848
- Who did you sell it to?
- Old Caecilius. Look,

04:36.339 --> 04:38.565
if you want to argue, why don't
you take it out with him?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.792
He's on Foss Street,
big villa, can't miss it.

04:40.827 --> 04:41.884
Thanks.

04:43.314 --> 04:44.783
What did he buy a big
blue wooden box for?

04:45.279 --> 04:46.756
Modern art!

04:47.175 --> 04:49.136
Out of the way, thats it.

04:49.952 --> 04:53.420
Oh, Rhombus, I'm a little bit peckish,
get me some ants in honey, good lad.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.458
Ooh, maybe a dormouse?

05:00.656 --> 05:01.705
What d'you think?

05:01.758 --> 05:03.173
You call it modern art.

05:03.248 --> 05:05.532
I call it a blooming great waste of space.

05:05.558 --> 05:07.413
But we're going up in the world, my love.

05:07.582 --> 05:10.475
Lucius Dextrus himself is coming here.
This afternoon.

05:10.607 --> 05:12.569
What with that, and our Evelina
about to be elevated...

05:12.604 --> 05:14.165
Oh, don't go on about it, Dad!

05:14.401 --> 05:17.632
If we'd moved to Rome, as I said,
she could have been a Vestal Virgin.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.813
- Someone mention Vestal Virgins?
- Quintus, don't be so rude.

05:20.848 --> 05:22.591
You apologise to the household gods!

05:22.642 --> 05:24.632
- Get off.
- Apologise, right now!

05:24.667 --> 05:26.249
The gods are always watching.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.316
Positions!

05:46.879 --> 05:49.423
There, now you've made the Heavens angry.

05:49.458 --> 05:50.703
Just say sorry.

05:52.204 --> 05:54.628
I tell you, Caecilius,
that boy will come to no good.

05:55.581 --> 05:57.574
Sorry, household gods.

05:57.609 --> 05:59.979
So where were you last night?
Down the thermopolium, I bet?

06:00.014 --> 06:02.750
Cavorting with Etruscans and 
Christians and all sorts.

06:02.785 --> 06:05.486
How's your head, sunshine?
How's your head?

06:05.521 --> 06:07.259
All right, Dad, give us a break!

06:07.294 --> 06:09.202
You want to smarten yourself up,
Quintus.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.044
Before Lucius Dextrus gets here.

06:11.502 --> 06:12.595
Look at your sister,

06:13.153 --> 06:15.632
she's giving us... status.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.184
Oh, yeah,
cos it's all about Evelina.

06:18.769 --> 06:22.697
She has the gift.
Be proud of your sister, for once.

06:22.732 --> 06:25.481
- Have you been consuming?
- Not this morning.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.092
Well, come on, sweetheart.
Practise!

06:28.474 --> 06:31.360
Oh, it's hot today,
the hypocaust is on full blast.

06:31.395 --> 06:32.949
The Mountain God must be happy.

06:33.217 --> 06:35.903
Breathe deeply.
Remember what the Sisterhood said.

06:39.188 --> 06:41.708
- It hurts.
- Oh, my love, is it too hot?

06:42.437 --> 06:44.383
Sometimes, in the smoke...

06:45.551 --> 06:48.644
- I see the most terrible things.
- Like what?

06:50.264 --> 06:51.495
A face.

06:53.058 --> 06:54.516
A face of stone.

06:54.803 --> 06:57.044
It'll make sense.
One day.

06:57.079 --> 06:58.664
Sister Spurrina promised.

06:58.948 --> 07:02.233
The veil will be parted,
and you'll be a seer.

07:28.422 --> 07:29.645
Who are you?

07:32.706 --> 07:34.660
Ah, I've got it!
Foss Street, this way!

07:34.695 --> 07:36.614
No, but I found this big sort
of amphitheatre thing,

07:36.795 --> 07:38.565
we could gather
everyone together there,

07:38.600 --> 07:40.602
then we could ring a big bell...

07:40.643 --> 07:42.363
- They got bells yet?
- What d'you want a bell for?

07:42.398 --> 07:43.416
To warn everyone.

07:43.451 --> 07:44.586
Start the evacuation.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.586
What time does Vesuvius erupt?

07:46.621 --> 07:48.354
It's 79AD, 23rd of August,

07:48.389 --> 07:50.088
which makes Volcano Day... tomorrow.

07:50.123 --> 07:52.281
Plenty of time
to get everyone out, easy.

07:52.287 --> 07:53.573
Yeah,
except we're not going to.

07:54.277 --> 07:56.417
But that's what you do,
Doctor, you save people!

07:56.452 --> 07:58.557
Not this time.
Pompeii is a fixed point in history.

07:58.592 --> 08:00.692
What happens, happens.
There is no stopping it.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.678
- Says who?
- Says me.

08:02.713 --> 08:03.718
What, and you're in charge?

08:03.753 --> 08:04.940
TARDIS, Time Lord, yeah!

08:04.975 --> 08:06.128
Donna, Human, no!

08:06.187 --> 08:07.897
I don't need your permission!
I'm telling myself!

08:07.932 --> 08:09.396
You stand here announcing the end,

08:09.431 --> 08:11.525
they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer!

08:11.585 --> 08:14.198
Now, come on. TARDIS. 
We are getting out of here.

08:14.615 --> 08:17.856
I might just have something
to say about that, spaceman!

08:17.958 --> 08:19.134
Oh, I bet you will!

08:29.282 --> 08:30.697
The tall one.

08:31.185 --> 08:32.918
He calls us mad.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.032
Then he is a stranger to Pompeii.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.059
Soon, he will learn.

08:37.259 --> 08:38.909
We have found it, Sister Spurrina.

08:39.408 --> 08:42.448
In the Thirteenth Book
of the Sibylline Oracles.

08:42.482 --> 08:43.765
The blue box.

08:44.528 --> 08:46.761
A temple made of wood.

08:47.021 --> 08:50.944
And yet, the Sibyl foretold that the box
would appear at the time of storms

08:51.019 --> 08:53.601
and fire and betrayal.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.415
Sisters!

09:04.084 --> 09:05.691
Reverend Mother, you should sleep.

09:05.726 --> 09:08.985
The Sibylline Oracles are wrong.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.801
But we have venerated her
words for generations.

09:11.836 --> 09:14.264
This is a new age.

09:14.742 --> 09:17.443
Heed my words.

09:17.829 --> 09:22.173
I predict a future
of prosperity and might.

09:22.208 --> 09:25.410
An endless Empire of Pompeii,

09:25.836 --> 09:30.289
reaching out from this city
to topple Rome itself,

09:30.324 --> 09:34.573
and encompass the whole wide world.

09:35.382 --> 09:39.505
If the disciples of the blue box
defy this prophecy,

09:39.764 --> 09:44.764
their blood will run across
the Temple floor.

09:47.137 --> 09:48.796
The gods approve.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.770
Positions!

09:58.467 --> 09:59.527
There you go.

09:59.856 --> 10:01.534
Thank you, kind sir.

10:02.048 --> 10:04.807
I'm afraid business is closed for the day.
I'm expecting a visitor.

10:04.842 --> 10:06.784
That's me.
I'm a visitor. Hello.

10:08.523 --> 10:10.573
- Who are you?
- I am...

10:11.187 --> 10:12.109
Spartacus.

10:13.261 --> 10:14.268
And so am I.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.633
Mr and Mrs Spartacus?

10:15.773 --> 10:17.711
- 0h, no, we're not married.
- We're not together.

10:17.773 --> 10:18.917
0h, brother and sister?

10:19.303 --> 10:21.568
Yes, of course!
You look very much alike.

10:22.473 --> 10:23.568
- Really?
- Really?

10:23.603 --> 10:25.342
I'm sorry,
but I'm not open for trading.

10:25.442 --> 10:27.582
- And that trade would be?
- Marble.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.366
Lobus Caecilius.

10:29.764 --> 10:32.402
Mining,
polishing and design thereof.

10:33.732 --> 10:36.224
- If you want marble, I'm your man.
- That's good, cos...

10:36.259 --> 10:37.915
I'm the marble inspector.

10:38.297 --> 10:40.659
By the gods of Commerce,
an inspection!

10:40.987 --> 10:44.695
I'm sorry, sir.
I do apologise for my son.

10:45.218 --> 10:46.405
This is my good wife, Metella.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.802
- I confess, we're not prepared...
- Don't worry.

10:49.837 --> 10:53.165
I'm sure you've nothing to hide.
Although, frankly, THAT object...

10:53.259 --> 10:55.988
- looks rather like wood to me.
- I told you to get rid of it.

10:56.631 --> 10:58.111
I only bought it today!

10:59.599 --> 11:00.838
Ah, well... Caveat emptor.

11:00.884 --> 11:03.323
Oh, you're Celtic. There's lovely.

11:03.477 --> 11:07.526
I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take
it off your hands, for a proper inspection.

11:07.561 --> 11:10.513
While we're here,
would you recommend a holiday, Spartacus?

11:11.265 --> 11:12.862
Don't know what you mean, Spartacus.

11:13.112 --> 11:17.058
Well, this lovely family.
Mother and father and son.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.055
Don't you think
they should get out of town?

11:19.090 --> 11:21.272
- Why should we do that?
- Well, the volcano, for start.

11:21.307 --> 11:22.629
- What?
- The volcano.

11:22.664 --> 11:25.569
- The WHAT-ano?
- That great big volcano right on your doorstep...

11:25.604 --> 11:28.475
Oh, Spartacus, for shame, we haven't
even greeted the household gods yet.

11:29.627 --> 11:32.082
They don't know what it is.
Vesuvius is just a mountain to them,

11:32.117 --> 11:33.300
the top hasn't blown off yet.

11:33.814 --> 11:35.776
The Romans haven't even got a word for volcano.

11:35.964 --> 11:37.174
Not until tomorrow.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.972
Oh, great, they can learn a new word.

11:39.246 --> 11:41.257
- As they die.
- Donna, stop it.

11:41.766 --> 11:44.296
Whatever sort of kids
you've been flying round with,

11:44.436 --> 11:45.700
don't tell me to shut up.

11:46.009 --> 11:48.585
That boy, how old is he? Sixteen?

11:48.965 --> 11:51.556
- And tomorrow, he burns to death.
- And that's my fault?

11:51.647 --> 11:52.664
Right now, yes.

11:53.007 --> 11:56.366
Announcing Lucius Petrus Dextrus,

11:56.769 --> 11:59.477
Chief Augur of the City Government.

12:03.363 --> 12:05.909
Lucius. My pleasure, as always.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.005
Quintus, stand up!

12:07.795 --> 12:10.721
A rare and great honour, sir,
for you to come to my house...

12:12.626 --> 12:16.210
The birds are flying north,
and the wind is in the west.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.555
Quite. Absolutely.

12:19.000 --> 12:19.925
That's good, is it?

12:19.960 --> 12:23.239
- Only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow.
- There now, Metella.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.297
- Have you ever heard SUCH wisdom?
- Never.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.193
It's an honour.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.075
Pardon me, sir, I have guests,

12:32.110 --> 12:34.317
this is Spartacus and... Spartacus.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.693
A name is but a cloud upon a summer wind.

12:36.728 --> 12:38.800
But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark.

12:41.129 --> 12:42.399
But what is the dark,

12:42.825 --> 12:46.925
- other than an omen of the sun?
- I concede that every sun must set...

12:46.997 --> 12:50.064
- And yet the son of the father must also rise.
- Damn.

12:51.092 --> 12:52.292
Very clever, sir.

12:52.826 --> 12:54.434
Evidently, a man of learning.

12:54.528 --> 12:57.111
Oh, yes. But don't mind me, don't want to disturb the status quo.

12:57.146 --> 12:58.232
He's Celtic.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.969
- We'll be off in a minute.
- I'm not going.

13:01.004 --> 13:02.320
It's ready, sir.

13:02.355 --> 13:03.637
- You've got to.
- Well, I'm not.

13:03.646 --> 13:05.663
The moment of revelation.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.294
And here it is!
Exactly as you've specified.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.863
- It pleases you, sir?
- As the rain pleases the soil.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.545
Oh, now that's... different.
Who designed that, then?

13:15.665 --> 13:17.254
My Lord Lucius was very specific.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.640
- Where did you get the pattern?
- On the rain and mist and wind.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.154
- But that looks like a circuit.
- Made of stone.

13:22.189 --> 13:24.576
D'you mean you just dreamt that thing up?

13:24.796 --> 13:26.909
That is my job.
As City Augur.

13:26.944 --> 13:28.188
What's that, then, like the mayor?

13:29.827 --> 13:32.790
Oh! You must excuse my friend.
She's from Barcelona.

13:32.825 --> 13:35.551
But this is an age of superstition,
of OFFICIAL superstition.

13:35.967 --> 13:38.431
The Augur is paid by the city
to tell the future.

13:38.978 --> 13:41.603
"The wind will blow from the west",
that's their Ten O'Clock News.

13:41.685 --> 13:43.226
They're laughing at us.

13:44.351 --> 13:48.050
Those two use words like tricksters,
they're mocking us.

13:48.272 --> 13:50.852
No, no, no.
I meant no offence.

13:50.887 --> 13:53.174
I'm sorry, my daughter's
been consuming the vapours.

13:53.209 --> 13:55.461
By the gods, mother,
what have you been doing?

13:55.988 --> 13:58.461
- Not now, Quintus.
- But she's sick, just look at her!

13:58.496 --> 14:00.973
I gather I have a rival
in this household.

14:01.099 --> 14:02.545
Another with the gift.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.046
Oh, she's been promised to
the Sibylline Sisterhood.

14:05.630 --> 14:07.785
They say she has remarkable visions.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.116
The prophecies of women
are limited and dull,

14:10.147 --> 14:13.219
only the menfolk have the capacity
for true perception.

14:13.221 --> 14:15.144
I'll tell you where the wind's 
blowing right now, mate.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.718
The Mountain God marks your words.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.419
I'd be careful, if I were you.

14:21.421 --> 14:24.062
- Consuming the vapours, you said?
- They give me strength.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.667
- It doesn't look like it to me.
- Is that your opinion...

14:27.481 --> 14:29.358
- as a doctor?
- I beg your pardon?

14:29.393 --> 14:31.177
Doctor, that's your name.

14:31.555 --> 14:33.551
- How did you know that?
- And YOU...

14:34.972 --> 14:36.941
You call yourself Noble.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.532
Now then, Evelina, don't be rude.

14:39.794 --> 14:41.472
No, no, no, no, let her talk.

14:41.476 --> 14:43.859
You both come from so far away.

14:43.894 --> 14:47.441
The female soothsayer is inclined
to invent all sorts of vagaries.

14:47.476 --> 14:49.228
0h, not this time, Lucius.

14:49.245 --> 14:51.374
No, I reckon
you've been out-soothsayed.

14:51.425 --> 14:52.685
Is that so...

14:53.581 --> 14:56.504
- man from Gallifrey?
- What?

14:59.516 --> 15:01.281
The strangest of images...

15:01.541 --> 15:04.199
Your home is lost in fire, is it not?

15:04.241 --> 15:05.185
Doctor, what are they doing?

15:05.398 --> 15:09.921
- And you, daughter of... London.
- How does he know that?

15:10.030 --> 15:11.785
This is the gift of Pompeii.

15:12.081 --> 15:14.206
Every single oracle tells the truth.

15:14.241 --> 15:16.331
- That's impossible.
- Doctor...

15:17.641 --> 15:18.988
she is returning.

15:20.633 --> 15:21.805
Who is? Who's she?

15:21.857 --> 15:24.290
And you, daughter of London...

15:25.894 --> 15:27.872
there is something on your back.

15:29.687 --> 15:30.666
What's that mean?

15:30.701 --> 15:33.029
Even the word 'doctor' is false.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.945
Your real name is hidden.

15:36.152 --> 15:40.585
It burns in the stars, in the 
Cascade of Medusa herself.

15:41.219 --> 15:42.901
You are a Lord, sir.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.931
A Lord of Time.

15:51.023 --> 15:52.197
Evelina!

15:56.178 --> 15:57.746
She didn't mean to be rude,

15:58.892 --> 16:00.559
she's ever such a good girl.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.222
But when the gods speak through her...

16:04.768 --> 16:07.240
- What's wrong with her arm?
- An irritation of the skin.

16:07.476 --> 16:09.247
She never complains, bless her.

16:09.591 --> 16:11.231
We bathe it in olive oil every night.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.275
What is it?

16:14.070 --> 16:16.459
Evelina said you'd come from far away.

16:17.752 --> 16:20.398
Please, have you ever seen anything like it?

16:30.022 --> 16:31.312
It's stone.

16:41.112 --> 16:42.941
- Different sort of hypocaust.
- Oh, yes.

16:42.976 --> 16:44.531
We're very advanced in Pompeii.

16:44.566 --> 16:47.384
In Rome, they're still using
the old wood-burning furnaces.

16:47.419 --> 16:50.625
But we've got hot springs, 
leading from Vesuvius itself.

16:50.821 --> 16:52.991
- Who thought of that?
- The soothsayers.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.532
After the great earthquake,
17 years ago.

16:55.991 --> 16:57.174
An awful lot of damage.

16:58.123 --> 16:59.514
But we rebuilt.

16:59.636 --> 17:01.044
Didn't you think of moving away?

17:01.463 --> 17:03.173
No, then again, San Francisco...

17:03.208 --> 17:05.930
That's a little restaurant in...
Naples, isn't it?

17:05.944 --> 17:07.988
- What's that noise?
- Don't know.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.388
Happens all the time.

17:10.242 --> 17:12.613
They say the gods of the Underworld
are stirring.

17:14.387 --> 17:16.170
But after the earthquake,
let me guess...

17:16.329 --> 17:19.757
- is that when the soothsayers started making sense?
- Oh, yes, very much so.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.182
I mean, they'd always been,
shall we say, imprecise?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.912
But then the soothsayers, the augurs,
the haruspex, all of them,

17:26.946 --> 17:28.691
they saw the truth,
again and again.

17:28.726 --> 17:29.730
It's quite amazing.

17:30.363 --> 17:33.185
They predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.717
Have they said anything about tomorrow?

17:34.833 --> 17:35.907
No.

17:36.405 --> 17:37.858
Why, should they?
Why d'you ask?

17:37.893 --> 17:39.765
No, no, no reason.
Just asking.

17:39.987 --> 17:42.911
But the soothsayers,
they all consume the vapours, yeah?

17:42.946 --> 17:44.147
That's how they see.

17:45.310 --> 17:46.844
Ipso facto...

17:48.350 --> 17:49.531
Look you...

17:50.634 --> 17:52.980
- They're all consuming this.
- Dust?

17:53.354 --> 17:54.811
Tiny particles of rock.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.247
They're breathing in Vesuvius.

18:06.471 --> 18:07.724
Quintus, me old son.

18:07.759 --> 18:11.521
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus,
where does he live?

18:11.556 --> 18:12.879
It's nothing to do with me.

18:13.716 --> 18:14.716
Let me try again.

18:15.203 --> 18:18.504
This Lucius Petrus Dextrus...

18:21.066 --> 18:21.977
Where does he live?

18:38.082 --> 18:39.221
Don't tell my dad.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.524
Only if you don't tell mine.

18:48.363 --> 18:49.535
Pass me that torch.

19:07.162 --> 19:08.132
The liar!

19:08.309 --> 19:09.822
He told my father
it was the only one.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.224
Well, plenty of marble
merchants in this town.

19:13.684 --> 19:16.764
Tell them all the same,
get all the components from different places,

19:16.799 --> 19:18.347
so no-one can see what it is.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.019
- Which is what?
- The future.

19:20.089 --> 19:22.437
Doctor, we are building the future.

19:22.632 --> 19:24.489
As dictated by the gods.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.494
You're not supposed to laugh.
Thanks for that.

19:31.159 --> 19:32.222
What d'you think?

19:33.098 --> 19:34.269
The Goddess Venus.

19:34.710 --> 19:35.815
That's sacrilege.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.147
Nice to see you laugh, though.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.653
What d'you do in old Pompeii,
then, girls of your age?

19:43.866 --> 19:47.373
You got... mates?
D'you go hanging about round the shops?

19:47.821 --> 19:49.041
TK Maximus?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.298
I am promised to
the Sisterhood for life.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.039
- D'you get any choice in that?
- It's not my decision.

19:56.091 --> 19:58.437
The Sisters chose for me.
I have the gift of sight.

19:59.193 --> 20:00.261
Then...

20:01.028 --> 20:03.535
- What can you see happening tomorrow?
- Is tomorrow special?

20:04.346 --> 20:05.531
You tell me.

20:06.298 --> 20:07.474
What do you see?

20:10.573 --> 20:12.661
The sun will rise. The sun will set.

20:12.953 --> 20:14.154
Nothing special at all.

20:16.399 --> 20:17.441
Look,

20:18.247 --> 20:20.567
don't tell the Doctor
I said anything cos he'll kill me,

20:20.685 --> 20:22.378
but I've got a prophecy too.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.212
Evelina, I'm sorry,
but you've got to hear me out.

20:27.247 --> 20:29.604
- Sisters!
- Evelina, can you hear me?

20:30.406 --> 20:31.490
Listen...

20:34.064 --> 20:35.659
There is only one prophecy.

20:35.914 --> 20:38.826
But everything I'm about to 
say to you is true. I swear.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.349
just listen to me.

20:40.861 --> 20:44.038
Tomorrow,
that mountain is gonna explode.

20:44.481 --> 20:45.897
Evelina, please listen.

20:46.584 --> 20:48.757
The air is gonna fill with ash and rocks,

20:48.792 --> 20:49.995
tons and tons of it,

20:50.547 --> 20:53.412
and this whole town is gonna get buried.
That's not true.

20:53.845 --> 20:54.914
I'm sorry.

20:55.492 --> 20:56.801
I'm really sorry.

20:57.984 --> 21:00.261
- But everyone's going to die.
- A new prophecy!

21:00.296 --> 21:02.632
Impossible.
There is only one.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.583
Even if you don't believe me, 
tell your family to get out of town.

21:05.662 --> 21:08.623
Just for one day, just for tomorrow.
But you've got to get out.

21:08.772 --> 21:11.629
- You've got to leave Pompeii!
- This is false prophecy.

21:17.102 --> 21:18.220
The noblewoman.

21:18.255 --> 21:21.548
She spoke of a new prophecy,
the fall of Pompeii.

21:21.624 --> 21:23.629
Pompeii will last forever.

21:23.631 --> 21:27.616
- Then what must we do?
- The False Prophet must die.

21:28.148 --> 21:29.615
Sacrifice her!

21:31.354 --> 21:33.740
Put this one... there.

21:35.069 --> 21:36.061
This one...

21:38.094 --> 21:39.344
there.

21:40.179 --> 21:42.621
Er, keep that one upside down,
what have you got?

21:42.656 --> 21:45.028
- Enlighten me.
- What, the soothsayer doesn't know?

21:45.063 --> 21:47.444
A seed may float on the breeze
in any direction.

21:47.497 --> 21:48.651
Yeah, I knew you would say that.

21:48.686 --> 21:52.337
- But it's an energy converter.
- An energy converter of what?

21:52.533 --> 21:53.619
I don't know.

21:54.099 --> 21:56.435
Isn't that brilliant? 
I love not knowing. Keeps me on my toes.

21:56.446 --> 21:58.254
It must be awful being a prophet,

21:58.464 --> 22:00.634
waking up every morning,
"Is it raining? Yes, I said so."

22:00.669 --> 22:03.242
Takes all the fun out of life.
But who designed this, Lucius, hm?

22:04.913 --> 22:07.768
- Who gave you these instructions?
- I think you've babbled enough.

22:07.803 --> 22:09.930
Lucius, tell me, honestly,
I'm on your side.

22:09.965 --> 22:11.966
- I can help.
- You insult the gods.

22:12.569 --> 22:14.910
There can be only one sentence.
At arms!

22:16.171 --> 22:17.560
Oh, morituri te salutant.

22:17.595 --> 22:18.908
Celtic prayers won't help you now.

22:18.943 --> 22:20.222
But, sir, he made me do it.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.693
- Mr Dextrus, please, don't.
- Come on now, Quintus.

22:22.728 --> 22:23.860
Dignity in death.

22:24.277 --> 22:25.807
I respect your victory, Lucius.

22:26.615 --> 22:27.535
Shake on it?

22:28.898 --> 22:29.983
Come on.

22:31.457 --> 22:32.501
Dying man's wish?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.257
- But he's...
- Show me.

22:42.524 --> 22:43.973
The work of the gods.

22:44.986 --> 22:46.066
He's stone!

22:46.101 --> 22:48.395
Armless enough, though.
Whoops! Quintus!

22:51.479 --> 22:53.295
- Run!
- The carvings!

22:53.469 --> 22:54.822
Run!

22:55.377 --> 22:56.785
My carvings!

22:58.185 --> 22:59.400
The work is unbroken.

23:00.025 --> 23:02.309
Oh, Lord of the Mountain,
I beseech you!

23:02.661 --> 23:03.729
This man...

23:04.439 --> 23:06.431
would prevent the rise of Pompeii.

23:08.995 --> 23:11.174
Lord, I beg of you, show yourself.

23:13.815 --> 23:15.306
Show yourself!

23:23.221 --> 23:24.288
No sign of them.

23:24.982 --> 23:26.754
Nice little bit of allons-y.
I think we're all right.

23:26.789 --> 23:27.743
But his arm, Doctor.

23:28.518 --> 23:29.825
Is that happening to Evelina?

23:31.261 --> 23:32.310
What was that?

23:35.133 --> 23:36.048
The mountain?

23:36.877 --> 23:37.988
No, it's closer.

23:46.169 --> 23:48.730
- Footsteps...
- It can't be.

23:51.301 --> 23:53.642
- Footsteps underground.
- What is it?

23:54.041 --> 23:55.120
What IS it?

24:02.163 --> 24:03.961
What is it?
What's that noise?

24:05.222 --> 24:06.913
Doesn't sound like Vesuvius!

24:06.948 --> 24:08.569
Caecilius, all of you! Get out!

24:08.604 --> 24:10.284
- Doctor! What is it?
- I think we're being followed.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.429
Just get out!

24:30.418 --> 24:31.496
The gods are with us.

24:31.607 --> 24:32.692
Water! We need water!

24:32.727 --> 24:34.744
Quintus, all of you, get water!
Donna!

24:34.956 --> 24:37.057
Blest are we to see the gods.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.829
Talk to me, that's all I want!

24:45.546 --> 24:47.378
Talk to me, just tell me you are.

24:47.764 --> 24:49.133
Don't hurt these people!

24:52.874 --> 24:54.807
I'm the Doctor,
just tell me who you are.

24:57.616 --> 24:58.657
Doctor!

25:17.302 --> 25:18.356
What was it?

25:18.552 --> 25:22.385
Carapace of stone,
held together by internal magma,

25:23.515 --> 25:26.479
not too difficult to stop.
But I reckon that's just the foot soldier.

25:26.698 --> 25:28.948
Doctor, or whatever your name is,

25:29.321 --> 25:31.033
you bring bad luck on this house.

25:31.068 --> 25:33.101
I thought your son was brilliant,
aren't you going to thank him?

25:37.231 --> 25:38.318
Still...

25:38.962 --> 25:40.706
If there ARE aliens at work in Pompeii,

25:40.741 --> 25:41.987
it's a good thing we stayed.

25:42.546 --> 25:43.582
Donna!

25:45.262 --> 25:46.251
Donna?

25:48.223 --> 25:49.269
Donna?

25:49.331 --> 25:52.376
You have got to be kidding me.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.676
The False Prophet
will surrender both her blood

25:56.801 --> 25:58.778
- and her breath.
- I'll surrender you in a minute.

25:58.813 --> 25:59.764
Don't you dare!

25:59.799 --> 26:01.710
- You will be silent.
- Listen, sister.

26:02.032 --> 26:03.819
You might have eyes
on the back of your hands,

26:03.843 --> 26:06.699
but they'll be in the back of your head
when I've finished with you!

26:06.838 --> 26:08.837
LET me GO!

26:08.967 --> 26:12.293
This prattling voice will cease forever!

26:12.313 --> 26:13.675
Oh, that'll be the day.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.629
No man is allowed
to enter the Temple of Sibyl.

26:19.664 --> 26:21.650
Well, that's all right, just us girls.

26:21.685 --> 26:24.470
Do you know, I met the Sibyl once,
hell of a woman.

26:24.552 --> 26:27.972
Blimey, she could dance the Tarantella!
Nice teeth.

26:28.315 --> 26:30.602
Truth be told, I think
she had a bit of a thing for me.

26:30.637 --> 26:32.153
I said it would never last,
she said, "I know".

26:32.188 --> 26:33.267
Well, she would.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.094
- You OK there?
- Oh, never better.

26:35.276 --> 26:36.779
- I like the toga.
- Thank you.

26:37.086 --> 26:39.268
- And the ropes?
- Yeah, not so much.

26:41.614 --> 26:42.654
What magic is this?

26:43.053 --> 26:46.125
Let me tell you about the Sibyl,
the founder of this religion.

26:46.353 --> 26:48.265
She would be ashamed of you.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.876
All her wisdom and insight gone sour.

26:51.047 --> 26:53.233
Is that how you spread the word?
On the blade of a knife?

26:53.268 --> 26:55.906
Yes, a knife that now welcomes you.

26:55.941 --> 26:58.278
Show me this man!

27:01.583 --> 27:03.915
High Priestess,
the stranger would defile us.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.172
Let me see.
This one is different.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.810
He carries starlight in his wake.

27:08.825 --> 27:10.070
Oh, very perceptive.

27:10.218 --> 27:12.266
Where do these words of wisdom come from?

27:12.301 --> 27:15.629
- The gods whisper to me.
- They've done far more than that.

27:16.742 --> 27:19.778
Might I beg audience?
Look upon the High Priestess?

27:22.229 --> 27:23.318
Oh, my God.

27:23.992 --> 27:26.821
- What's happened to YOU?
- The heavens have blessed me.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.677
If I might...

27:35.274 --> 27:36.945
- Does it hurt?
- It is necessary.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.616
- Who told you that?
- The voices.

27:38.777 --> 27:40.317
Is that what's gonna happen to Evelina?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.628
Is this what's gonna happen to all of you?

27:43.722 --> 27:45.091
The blessings are manifold.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.888
- They're stone.
- Exactly.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.884
The people of Pompeii are turning 
to stone BEFORE the volcano erupts.

27:56.186 --> 27:59.806
- But why?
- This word, this image in your mind.

27:59.816 --> 28:02.526
This... volcano...
What is that?

28:02.561 --> 28:04.445
More to the point,
why don't you know about it?

28:05.357 --> 28:08.702
- Who are you?
- High Priestess of the Sibylline.

28:08.851 --> 28:11.292
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm talking to the creature inside you.

28:11.541 --> 28:13.396
The thing seeding itself
into a human body,

28:13.431 --> 28:14.787
in the dust, in the lungs,

28:15.233 --> 28:17.363
taking over the flesh and turning it into...

28:17.793 --> 28:19.633
- What?
- Your knowledge...

28:19.951 --> 28:21.053
is impossible.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.866
Oh, but you can read my mind,
you know it's not.

28:23.901 --> 28:26.046
I demand you tell me who you are!

28:26.178 --> 28:29.684
We... are... awakening.

28:29.719 --> 28:30.935
The voice of the gods!

28:31.810 --> 28:36.810
Words of wisdom, words of power.
Words of wisdom, words of power...

28:37.914 --> 28:39.327
Name yourself! Planet of origin.

28:39.362 --> 28:40.741
Galactic coordinates.

28:40.790 --> 28:44.371
Designation according to the 
ratification of the Shadow Proclamation.

28:44.463 --> 28:46.866
We...

28:47.474 --> 28:48.647
...are... rising.

28:48.682 --> 28:51.387
Tell... me... your name!

28:53.615 --> 28:56.841
Pyrovile.

28:58.787 --> 29:02.356
Pyrovile, Pyrovile, Pyrovile...

29:02.390 --> 29:04.708
- What's a Pyrovile?
- That, growing inside HER.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.188
- She's the halfway stage.
- And that turns into...

29:07.223 --> 29:08.973
That thing in the villa was an adult Pyrovile.

29:09.025 --> 29:13.882
And the breath of a Pyrovile 
will incinerate YOU, Doctor.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.696
I warn you, I'm armed!

29:15.761 --> 29:16.817
Donna, get that grille open.

29:17.492 --> 29:18.948
- What for?
- Just...

29:20.493 --> 29:21.900
What are the Pyrovile doing here?

29:21.935 --> 29:23.308
We fell from the heavens.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.591
We fell so far and so fast,
we were rendered into dust.

29:26.734 --> 29:28.801
Right, creatures of stone,
shattered on impact.

29:28.836 --> 29:30.325
When was that, 17 years ago?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.865
We have slept beneath
for thousands of years.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.370
OK, so 17 years ago woke you up,

29:35.552 --> 29:37.680
and now you're using human bodies
to reconstitute yourselves,

29:37.715 --> 29:42.015
- but why the psychic powers?
- We opened their minds and found such gifts.

29:42.050 --> 29:43.955
OK, so you force yourself inside a human brain,

29:43.990 --> 29:45.295
use the latent psychic talent to bond,

29:45.330 --> 29:46.410
I get that.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.375
But seeing the future, 
that is way beyond psychic,

29:48.410 --> 29:49.774
you can see through time.

29:50.182 --> 29:52.045
Where does the gift of prophecy come from?

29:53.043 --> 29:54.049
Got it!

29:54.178 --> 29:56.095
- Now get down!
- What, down there?

29:56.130 --> 29:57.134
Yes, down there.

29:57.233 --> 29:59.418
Why can't they predict a volcano?
Why is it being hidden?

29:59.453 --> 30:01.409
Sisters, I see into his mind.

30:01.636 --> 30:02.869
The weapon is harmless!

30:03.981 --> 30:05.163
Yeah, but it's gotta sting.

30:06.601 --> 30:07.800
Get down there!

30:11.760 --> 30:14.464
You fought her off with a water pistol.

30:14.955 --> 30:16.762
I bloody love you!

30:17.397 --> 30:18.477
This way!

30:18.835 --> 30:20.941
- Where are we going now?
- Into the volcano.

30:21.115 --> 30:22.846
- No way.
- Yes way.

30:23.174 --> 30:24.227
Appian way.

30:25.884 --> 30:30.110
The stranger would threaten our great endeavour.

30:30.584 --> 30:32.533
The time has come.

30:33.497 --> 30:37.126
The prophecy must ADVANCE!

30:37.944 --> 30:40.690
The prophecy must advance.

30:41.956 --> 30:43.377
Thy will be done.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.699
- Summon the Cult of Vulcan.
- Yes, sir.

30:48.017 --> 30:49.529
We must go to the mountain.

30:51.367 --> 30:53.609
Vesuvius awaits.

30:59.936 --> 31:01.392
Sunrise, my love.

31:02.697 --> 31:03.926
A new day.

31:04.949 --> 31:06.955
Even the longest night must end.

31:07.189 --> 31:08.846
The mountain's worse than ever.

31:09.469 --> 31:12.384
We killed a messenger of the gods
in our own house.

31:13.094 --> 31:14.590
Sweetheart, can you see?

31:15.085 --> 31:16.179
Tell us.

31:16.832 --> 31:17.926
What's going to happen?

31:18.936 --> 31:19.927
Just leave her alone.

31:25.204 --> 31:26.846
- I can see...
- What is it?

31:26.974 --> 31:28.108
A choice.

31:29.349 --> 31:30.959
Someone must make a choice.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.950
The most terrible choice.

31:38.427 --> 31:40.575
But if it's aliens setting off the volcano,

31:41.398 --> 31:44.023
doesn't that make it all right,
for you to stop it?

31:44.058 --> 31:45.135
Still part of history.

31:46.232 --> 31:47.948
But I'm history to you.

31:48.372 --> 31:51.598
You saved me, in 2008, 
you saved us all. Why's that different?

31:51.745 --> 31:53.455
Some things are fixed, some things are in flux.

31:53.490 --> 31:57.105
- Pompeii is fixed.
- How do you know which is which?

31:57.722 --> 31:59.524
Because that's how I see the universe.

31:59.735 --> 32:02.604
Every waking second,
I can see what is, what was,

32:02.888 --> 32:04.903
what could be, what must not.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.133
That's the burden of the Time Lord, Donna.

32:12.568 --> 32:14.127
And I'm the only one left.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.049
- How many people died?
- Stop it.

32:18.947 --> 32:21.624
Doctor, how many people died?

32:21.659 --> 32:22.798
20,000.

32:23.945 --> 32:25.415
Is that what you can see, Doctor?

32:26.300 --> 32:27.627
All 20,000?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.524
And you think that's all right, do you?

32:33.872 --> 32:35.135
They know we're here.
Come on!

32:46.823 --> 32:48.730
Almighty Vesuvius,

32:48.894 --> 32:52.725
accept these offerings, in Vulcan's design,

32:52.854 --> 32:57.395
and show unto us, I beseech you, 
the gods of the Underworld.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.053
It's the heart of Vesuvius.

33:35.967 --> 33:37.626
We're right inside the mountain.

33:38.441 --> 33:39.537
There's tons of them.

33:40.012 --> 33:40.955
What's that thing?

33:43.160 --> 33:45.445
Oh, hurry up and think of something,
Rocky fall's on its way.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.820
That's how they arrived.

33:47.413 --> 33:49.101
Or what's left of it. Escape pod?

33:49.606 --> 33:50.700
Prison ship?

33:51.488 --> 33:52.463
Gene bank?

33:53.300 --> 33:54.750
But why do they need a volcano?

33:55.787 --> 33:56.831
Maybe...

33:57.275 --> 33:59.745
it erupts, and they launch themselves 
back into space or something.

34:00.363 --> 34:01.909
Oh, it's worse than that.

34:02.568 --> 34:03.670
How could it be worse?

34:05.624 --> 34:06.834
Doctor, it's getting closer.

34:07.744 --> 34:08.882
Heathens!

34:10.226 --> 34:11.750
Defile us!

34:11.945 --> 34:15.438
They would desecrate your temple, 
My Lord gods!

34:15.797 --> 34:16.838
Come on.

34:17.367 --> 34:18.993
- We can't go in!
- Well, we can't go back.

34:20.681 --> 34:21.658
Crush them!

34:21.981 --> 34:23.128
Burn them!

34:43.813 --> 34:47.840
There is nowhere to run, Doctor, 
and daughter of London.

34:48.534 --> 34:51.877
Now then, Lucius, My Lords Pyrovillian,

34:52.311 --> 34:53.889
don't get yourselves in a lava.

34:54.362 --> 34:55.618
- In a lava?
- No?

34:55.652 --> 34:58.226
No. No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods,

34:58.458 --> 34:59.690
before we perish,

35:00.747 --> 35:03.428
once this new race of creatures is complete,

35:03.866 --> 35:04.889
then what?

35:06.065 --> 35:09.588
My masters will follow the 
example of Rome itself.

35:09.753 --> 35:14.753
An almighty empire, 
bestriding the whole of civilisation.

35:14.787 --> 35:16.428
But if you've crashed,

35:16.994 --> 35:18.885
and you've got all this technology,

35:19.306 --> 35:21.404
why don't you just go home?

35:21.439 --> 35:24.086
The Heaven of Pyrovillia is gone.

35:24.121 --> 35:25.475
What do you mean, "gone"?
Where's it gone?

35:25.551 --> 35:28.537
It was taken.
Pyrovillia is lost.

35:28.824 --> 35:33.824
But there is heat enough in this 
world for a new species to rise.

35:33.890 --> 35:36.266
Yeah, I should warn you, 
it's 70% water out there.

35:36.301 --> 35:40.749
Water can boil.
And everything will burn, Doctor.

35:41.122 --> 35:43.336
Then the whole planet is at stake.

35:43.371 --> 35:45.657
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

35:45.692 --> 35:46.718
Donna!

35:51.061 --> 35:52.826
You have them, My Lords!

35:55.829 --> 35:57.371
Could we be any more trapped?

36:04.627 --> 36:05.790
Little bit hot.

36:05.846 --> 36:08.502
See? The energy converter takes the lava,

36:08.824 --> 36:10.351
uses the power to create a fusion matrix,

36:10.386 --> 36:11.882
which welds Pyrovile to human.

36:11.912 --> 36:13.694
It's complete, they can convert millions.

36:13.996 --> 36:16.006
Can't you change it?
With these controls?

36:16.337 --> 36:17.544
Course I can, but don't you see?

36:17.591 --> 36:20.687
That's why the soothsayers can't see the volcano.
There IS no volcano.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.462
Vesuvius is never going to erupt.

36:22.990 --> 36:24.545
The Pyrovile are stealing all its power,

36:24.936 --> 36:26.678
they'll use it to take over the world.

36:28.185 --> 36:29.284
But... you can change it back?

36:29.958 --> 36:33.157
I can invert the system, 
set off the volcano, and blow them up, yes.

36:34.354 --> 36:35.554
But that's the choice, Donna.

36:36.219 --> 36:37.656
It's Pompeii or the world.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.403
Oh, my God.

36:40.551 --> 36:42.743
If Pompeii is destroyed then it's not just history.

36:43.330 --> 36:44.269
It's me.

36:45.881 --> 36:46.943
I make it happen.

36:54.581 --> 36:57.019
But the Pyrovile are rocks, 
maybe they can't be blown up.

36:57.054 --> 36:59.598
Vesuvius explodes with the 
force of 24 nuclear bombs.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.337
Nothing can survive it.

37:02.724 --> 37:04.017
Certainly not us.

37:06.983 --> 37:08.772
Never mind us.

37:14.394 --> 37:15.935
Push this lever and it's over.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.324
20,000 people.

37:41.348 --> 37:43.334
Nooooooo!

37:52.900 --> 37:54.203
A new prophecy.

37:54.206 --> 37:56.041
The future is changing.

38:31.701 --> 38:33.613
The sky is FALLING!

38:33.774 --> 38:36.737
Death. Only death!

38:46.101 --> 38:47.423
It WAS an escape pod.

39:07.189 --> 39:09.121
Out! Out, everybody out!

39:10.276 --> 39:11.579
Quickly!

39:31.685 --> 39:33.420
You lied to us!

39:35.263 --> 39:36.884
And yet, this was meant to be.

39:51.724 --> 39:52.667
Don't!

39:52.849 --> 39:54.407
Don't go to the beach!

39:54.805 --> 39:56.950
Don't go to the beach, go to the hills!

39:56.985 --> 39:57.990
Listen to me!

39:58.204 --> 40:00.141
Don't go to the beach, it's not SAFE!

40:00.724 --> 40:01.774
Listen to me!

40:03.158 --> 40:04.094
Come here.

40:04.438 --> 40:05.523
Give him to me!

40:09.283 --> 40:10.369
Come on.

40:21.465 --> 40:23.532
Yeah! God save us, Doctor!

40:31.231 --> 40:32.260
No!

40:34.629 --> 40:36.085
Don't say you can't!

40:42.177 --> 40:43.395
DOCTOR!

41:07.195 --> 41:09.056
You can't just LEAVE them!

41:09.626 --> 41:11.063
Don't you think I've done enough?

41:11.844 --> 41:14.125
History's back in place.
Everyone dies.

41:15.388 --> 41:16.890
You've got to go back.

41:17.036 --> 41:19.806
Doctor, I'm telling you, take this thing BACK!

41:29.442 --> 41:30.891
It's not fair.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.024
No, it's not.

41:34.900 --> 41:39.046
But your own planet.
It burned.

41:40.085 --> 41:42.004
That's just it. Don't you see, Donna?

41:42.225 --> 41:44.618
Can't you understand? If I could 
go back and save them then I would,

41:44.653 --> 41:45.727
but I can't.

41:50.259 --> 41:51.996
I can never go back, I can't.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.747
I just can't, I can't.

41:54.236 --> 41:55.418
Just someone.

41:56.284 --> 41:57.388
Please.

42:00.235 --> 42:01.551
Not the whole town.

42:02.215 --> 42:03.863
Just save someone.

42:44.555 --> 42:45.625
Come with me.

43:09.922 --> 43:11.896
It's never forgotten, Caecilius.

43:13.468 --> 43:16.973
Oh, time will pass, men will move on, 
and stories will fade.

43:17.008 --> 43:18.022
But one day,

43:19.751 --> 43:21.917
Pompeii will be found, again.

43:23.304 --> 43:24.744
In thousands of years.

43:28.677 --> 43:30.322
And everyone will remember you.

43:38.517 --> 43:39.693
What about you, Evelina?

43:40.970 --> 43:42.176
Can you see anything?

43:45.952 --> 43:47.162
The visions have gone.

43:48.047 --> 43:51.632
The explosion was so powerful
it cracked open a rift in time.

43:51.917 --> 43:54.395
Just for a second. That's what
gave you the gift of prophecy.

43:55.747 --> 43:58.604
It echoed back into the 
Pyrovillian alternative.

44:00.382 --> 44:01.724
But not any more.

44:02.844 --> 44:04.145
You're free.

44:07.421 --> 44:08.410
But tell me,

44:10.289 --> 44:11.627
who are you, Doctor?

44:12.415 --> 44:16.646
With your words, and your temple 
containing such size within?

44:17.075 --> 44:18.340
Oh, I was never here.

44:19.506 --> 44:20.473
Don't tell anyone.

44:22.823 --> 44:26.152
The great god Vulcan must be enraged!

44:29.066 --> 44:30.413
It's so volcanic.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.247
It's like some sort of...

44:38.305 --> 44:39.396
volcano.

44:44.085 --> 44:45.228
All those people.

45:35.515 --> 45:36.614
Thank you.

45:37.691 --> 45:38.883
Yeah.

45:43.838 --> 45:44.765
You were right.

45:46.002 --> 45:47.657
Sometimes I need someone.

45:50.602 --> 45:51.694
Welcome aboard.

45:53.129 --> 45:54.152
Yeah.

46:07.538 --> 46:09.032
Metella, my love,

46:09.067 --> 46:10.694
have you seen that clasp?

46:10.827 --> 46:11.835
The beetle one.

46:12.422 --> 46:15.986
- The Egyptians do love a scarab.
- Here we are, I was giving it a polish.

46:16.296 --> 46:17.625
Now calm down.

46:17.694 --> 46:20.963
If I get that contract, 
for the marble granaries of Alexandria,

46:21.147 --> 46:22.850
we'll be rich, you'll see...

46:23.065 --> 46:24.663
Hold on there, Evelina.

46:25.105 --> 46:27.044
You are not going out wearing that!

46:27.400 --> 46:30.620
Don't start, Dad,
it's what all the girls in Rome are wearing.

46:31.367 --> 46:32.323
I'll see you later.

46:34.007 --> 46:35.366
Are you seeing that boy again?

46:35.610 --> 46:37.070
Oh, look at Quintus.

46:37.117 --> 46:38.757
My son, the doctor.

46:38.792 --> 46:41.232
Mum, I've told you,
I'm not a doctor, not yet.

46:41.555 --> 46:43.614
I'm just a student of the physical sciences.

46:43.615 --> 46:45.140
Well, that's a doctor to me.

46:46.569 --> 46:48.873
Give thanks to the household gods before you go.

46:48.908 --> 46:49.975
There's a good boy.

46:51.357 --> 46:54.905
Come here, let me fix it.
You've got that folded all wrong...

46:57.894 --> 46:59.355
Thank you, household gods.

47:00.712 --> 47:02.000
Thank you for everything.

47:13.242 --> 47:15.680
Now then, Doctor Noble, 
Mrs Noble, come with me.

47:15.715 --> 47:17.278
Oh, no, no, we're not married.

47:17.313 --> 47:18.842
- So not married.
- Never.

47:18.927 --> 47:23.551
Here at Ood Operations, we like to 
think of the Ood as our trusted friends...

47:23.586 --> 47:24.885
Your unwanted guests.

47:24.958 --> 47:27.698
- Because at heart, what is an Ood...
- I'm on YOUR side!

47:27.733 --> 47:29.393
...but a reflection of us?

47:29.409 --> 47:30.430
It's a revolution.

47:30.447 --> 47:33.288
- If your Ood is happy...
- The circle must be broken.

47:33.296 --> 47:34.655
What is it? What is the circle?

47:34.656 --> 47:36.354
Then you'll be happy, too.

47:37.070 --> 47:38.108
Shoot!

47:38.703 --> 47:41.108
Doctor, Donna, friends!
Doctor, Donna, friends!
