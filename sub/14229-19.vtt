I'd be on the edge of it.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.880
Um, I was talking
to Elena, Zuzo.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.460
Ready. Turn out the lights.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.210
Noche-cer!

01:24.210 --> 01:25.920
Glow.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.880
Way to glow, princess.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.540
Thanks. Not bad.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.330
The more I practice
using the scepter,

01:38.330 --> 01:40.000
the less it tires me out.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.670
Oh, show him
the new one.

01:41.670 --> 01:45.000
Right. Mateo discovered this
in the Codex Maru.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.790
Reveal.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.170
Oh, hey, look,
it's Armando.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.540
Armando, no.
No, no, no, no!

01:58.540 --> 02:00.580
MATEO: Oh, no, don't do it!

02:02.330 --> 02:05.080
I wish my scepter had
"unsee that" power.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.750
Who knows,
maybe it does.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.120
But right now, let's see you
make it blaze.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.580
You sure you don't want
to see glow again?

02:11.580 --> 02:13.880
Come on, princess,
you've come a long way.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.710
since you tried
blasting Orizaba.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.170
You've had
plenty of practice.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, and it hasn't
been pretty.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.210
- Hey, you blasted that planter.
- I was aiming for the armor.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.880
That's because you're
all tense and worried.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.080
You gotta be calm.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.710
Be confident,
and bang,

02:28.710 --> 02:31.170
you'll hit your target.
Trust me, I'm your spirit guide.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.790
My job is giving
good advice.

02:32.790 --> 02:33.750
Okay.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.620
Blaze!

02:39.040 --> 02:41.000
Mateo, are you...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
oh... okay?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.330
That still
makes me dizzy.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.540
Don't worry.
I'm all right, Elena.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.830
That's the last time
I try that power.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.580
I can't let you
quit, princess.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.000
Nope, not gonna happen.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.830
You said
I'd hit the target.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.460
I didn't say when.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.620
Zuzo, Mateo
almost got hurt.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.210
That power's
too dangerous.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.540
Which is why you have
to learn to control it.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.710
- Uh-oh.
- ELENA: Why are
your stripes glowing?

03:04.710 --> 03:06.960
It means I've got
some spirit guiding to do.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.120
I have to stop a boy
who's about to steal

03:09.120 --> 03:10.830
his brother's cookies...
again.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.880
Wait, you're a spirit
guide to other people?

03:12.880 --> 03:17.040
Oh, yeah, but most people
don't get to talk to
their chanuls like you do.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.790
Or like wizards do
when they conjure us up.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.880
Chanuls are like
that little voice

03:20.880 --> 03:23.080
whispering in your ear
to do the right thing.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.380
No, no, Gustavo,
put the cookies back.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.830
So everyone has
a spirit guide?

03:29.830 --> 03:32.710
I think it's about time
I met mine.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.460
I wonder what animal
your chanul is.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.250
Probably something
quick and strong

03:40.250 --> 03:42.210
like a jaguar.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.790
Illuminara Mateo ayohel!

03:48.620 --> 03:52.000
Or a monkey.
Yay!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.330
This doesn't look right.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.960
- MATEO: Uh...

03:56.960 --> 03:59.000
Humans!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.750
It worked.
Look, I did it.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.120
So you're
my spirit guide?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.420
Who, me?

04:06.420 --> 04:08.210
No!

04:08.210 --> 04:11.040
That's bananas.
I'm Bobo.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.290
So you're not
a spirit guide?

04:13.290 --> 04:15.460
Yeah, almost.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.040
They kicked me out
of spirit guide school.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.880
But once I show them
that I can help humans,

04:18.880 --> 04:21.040
they'll see they made
a big mistake.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.620
That's why I'm here.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.710
Ooh, is this a tamborita?
I've heard about those.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.250
Oh, please give
that to me.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
It's very powerful.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.920
So's this.
It's a mázico.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.790
Magic spirit corn.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.380
Wooooo...

04:34.380 --> 04:36.460
Magic corn!

04:36.460 --> 04:40.000
You, uh, seem
nice and all, Bobo,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.210
but Mateo really wanted
to meet his own spirit
guide, so...

04:43.210 --> 04:45.000
Oh, he's all
tied up right now.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.670
But I've got
a great idea.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.960
I'll send you to
the spirit world to meet him.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.830
No, I don't wanna.
- Off you go!

04:51.830 --> 04:53.460
Elena, blast it
out of his hands.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.040
You're too close.
What if I miss?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.380
Just do it!

04:58.380 --> 05:00.540
Mázico quitemo pok!

05:03.880 --> 05:05.000
Elena!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.540
Mateo!

05:06.540 --> 05:08.210
No, wait,
bring him back.

05:08.210 --> 05:10.120
Why would I do that?

05:10.120 --> 05:11.500
He wanted to meet
his spirit guide.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.040
Now he will.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.250
Okay, off to help
some more humans,

05:15.250 --> 05:17.420
and earn my magic stripes.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.420
What did you do to him?!

05:22.290 --> 05:24.290
Zuzo!

05:24.290 --> 05:26.250
I'm pleased to report
that the cookies are safe.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.080
Well, Mateo isn't.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.960
He tried to summon
his spirit guide,

05:29.960 --> 05:33.040
but some monkey showed
up and sent him to
the spirit world.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.790
Are you guys
messing with me?
Mateo, come out, come out,

05:35.790 --> 05:38.210
- wherever you are.
- I'm serious.

05:38.210 --> 05:41.250
A spirit guide would
never send a human to
the spirit world.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.000
It's against the rules,
and kind of dangerous.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.960
Well, he did say he wasn't
exactly a spirit guide.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.290
- His name was Bobo.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.420
That's impossible
without spirit
guide stripes,

05:51.420 --> 05:53.670
and he doesn't
have those.
Does he?

05:53.670 --> 05:56.880
No, but he did have
this magic corn.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.210
He had a mázico?!
That explains it.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.000
A mázico can let
any spirit in and
out of the human world.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.670
I'm gonna have to
call in some back-up.

06:04.670 --> 06:07.500
- Oh, right, I better
find him first.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.210
Wait. Take me with you.

06:09.210 --> 06:10.920
Oh, I'd love to,
princess,

06:10.920 --> 06:12.830
but only spirits
belong in the spirit world.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.250
Oh, I could've stopped Bobo
with my scepter,

06:15.250 --> 06:17.670
but I froze up.
I have got get Mateo back.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.210
I've gotta warn ya.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.830
The spirit world can be
a pretty wild place.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.750
I don't care.
I'll do whatever it takes.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.960
On second thought,
you should absolutely come.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.250
- Hold on tight.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.830
Whoa!!

06:37.830 --> 06:39.830
You can open
your eyes now.

06:41.380 --> 06:45.210
Wow! Is that tree
part of the spirit world?

06:45.210 --> 06:46.500
That tree...

06:46.500 --> 06:48.750
is the spirit world.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.670
Good spirits
to your right.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.920
Not-so-good
spirits to your left.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.080
Like Orizaba?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.750
Yep. You better avoid
that part of the tree.
She holds a grudge.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.460
Up there, you've
got ancestors and
upper management.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.040
- The Zanies.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.250
They're a little bit,
well, let's just say

07:15.250 --> 07:16.880
they're free spirits.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.080
- Our destination.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.120
That's the spirit
guide branch.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.210
Spirit guides have
their own branch?

07:26.210 --> 07:28.210
Our own branch,
our own school,

07:28.210 --> 07:30.120
our own special magic.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.040
Not anyone can be
a spirit guide.

looking for Mateo?

09:13.830 --> 09:15.540
That's what
we're doing.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.000
This is where Mateo's
spirit guide lives,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.040
and spirit guides know
where their people are
at all times.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.880
Cacahuate! Cacahuate?!

09:25.880 --> 09:27.460
Hey, Zuzo.

09:28.830 --> 09:31.710
Welcome to the worst
day of my life.

09:31.710 --> 09:33.670
Don't worry, buddy.
We'll get you outta there.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.750
Why bother? My humans
are better off without me.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.710
Some of Cacahuate's people
have been having trouble lately,

09:40.710 --> 09:42.710
and he always
blames himself.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.880
Oh, I see you brought
company.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.830
Well, misery loves
an audience,

09:46.830 --> 09:49.920
so why not make
yourselves at home?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.880
Wait.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.210
You look like
a real human.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.670
That's because I am.

09:55.670 --> 09:57.500
This is
Princess Elena.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.710
She shouldn't
be here, Zuzo.

09:59.710 --> 10:02.040
Let's worry about that later.
What happened to you?

10:02.040 --> 10:05.790
Well, I caught Bobo
lurking near the mázico stalks.

10:05.790 --> 10:09.000
The next thing I knew,
he zapped me, tied me up,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
and used the mázico to fly off
to the real world.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.920
Well, he also used it
to send Mateo here.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.420
To the spirit world?

10:17.420 --> 10:19.420
Yep, so if you tell us
where Mateo is,

10:19.420 --> 10:22.040
I can get everyone
back where they belong.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.790
I can't. Bobo used
the mázico

10:24.790 --> 10:26.790
to remove my stripes
so I couldn't follow him.

10:26.790 --> 10:30.290
Without my stripes,
I have no spirit guide powers.

10:30.290 --> 10:31.830
Oh!

10:31.830 --> 10:34.460
Well, I can fix that.
Be right back.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.830
This is just
the latest

10:36.830 --> 10:38.830
of a long line
of failures.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.210
I gotta tell you,
you're lucky

10:41.210 --> 10:43.170
Zuzo's your
spirit guide.

10:43.170 --> 10:47.000
Mateo is a great wizard,
so you must be doing
something right.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.960
This should do the trick.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.960
Mázico mistico mas!

10:52.750 --> 10:54.880
There you go.
You have your magic back.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.210
- Not at all.

10:57.210 --> 10:59.620
But you can tell us
where Mateo is now, right?

10:59.620 --> 11:02.170
Unless I messed
that up, too.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.330
But okay, here goes.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.420
Oh, no, Mateo's
in the Loop

11:08.420 --> 11:10.420
with the Zanies.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.960
- It's a human.
!

11:19.960 --> 11:22.460
He must be very powerful
if he crossed over.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.170
- Look, he's wearing a crown.
- Let's make him our king.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.500
Where am I?
Who are you?

11:27.500 --> 11:28.960
You're in the Loop,
and we're the Zanies.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.420
- I'm Chavo. That's Chico...
- Hola.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.790
- Chaca...
- Hola.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.000
- Chiquita...
- Hola!

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
- Chuy...

11:34.000 --> 11:35.290
- and Steve.
- Yo.

11:35.290 --> 11:37.460
What shall we call you,
Your Royalness?

11:37.460 --> 11:39.460
I'm Mateo,
but I'm not a--

11:39.460 --> 11:42.250
- King Mateo!

11:42.250 --> 11:43.620
All hail Mateo!

11:43.620 --> 11:46.540
King of the Zanies!

11:46.540 --> 11:48.880
Come on.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.540
We need you, buddy.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.540
You have to help us
rescue Mateo.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.960
Mateo is better off
without me.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.920
You two go ahead.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.750
Guys, Bobo's
in the real world,

11:58.750 --> 12:01.040
and his bad advice
is causing trouble.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.000
We need all spirit
paws on deck.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.040
I'm on my way.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.080
Wait! What about Mateo?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.040
That's why I brought
you here, princess.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.000
I figured you and Cacahuate
could fetch Mateo

12:11.000 --> 12:12.670
while I round up Bobo.

12:12.670 --> 12:14.380
What, are you
out of your mind?!

12:14.380 --> 12:16.830
You got your stripes back,
so all you have to do

12:16.830 --> 12:18.210
is grab Elena
and Mateo's hands,

12:18.210 --> 12:20.000
and bring them home.
Simple as that.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.880
But Mateo's in the Loop,

12:21.880 --> 12:25.080
and I'm no match for
a bunch of wild Zanies.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.040
I couldn't even
stop Bobo.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.460
Cacahuate, you don't
give up the game

12:29.460 --> 12:31.000
because of
one bad play.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.170
You two are gonna make
a great team.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.000
I just know it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.080
All right, now go out
and get our boy.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.250
I'll see you
on the other side.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.620
- We're on it.
- We're doomed.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.880
How about a little
extra floor wax?

12:49.880 --> 12:53.460
If shiny is good,
then shinier is fin-ier.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.210
Hmm.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.420
Maybe a little extra
wax today.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.170
Shinier is fin-ier.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.920
I know.
Try jumping on it.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.960
That'll really give it
a good whack.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.210
I know.
I'll jump on it.

13:10.210 --> 13:12.080
Great minds
think alike.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.420
I bet if you
turn up the heat,

13:19.420 --> 13:21.460
it'll cook
twice as fast.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.000
Oh, I'll turn up the heat.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.210
This spirit guide
stuff is a cinch.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.500
My pie! Oh!

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
Bobo.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.830
Hi. Are you here to see
all the great work I'm doing,

13:37.830 --> 13:39.580
and make me
a spirit guide?

13:39.580 --> 13:40.960
Uh, no.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.250
That's bananas!

13:43.250 --> 13:45.620
Give me one good reason
why not.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.670
- You give bad advice.
- You have poor judgment.

13:47.670 --> 13:49.710
And leave a trail of destruction
wherever you go.

13:49.710 --> 13:52.080
Sheesh, I said
one good reason.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.960
Look, that's the old me.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.880
This is the new
and improved Bobo.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.040
Wait till you see
all the good advice I've given.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.830
That'll prove
I've earned my stripes.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.920
Voila!

14:02.920 --> 14:04.920
Ay, abuelo,
why did you

14:04.920 --> 14:06.880
even put the helmet on
in the first place?

14:06.880 --> 14:10.080
Oh! I cannot
get it off.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.670
I'm just saving
the best for last.

14:14.670 --> 14:17.620
Voila!

14:20.040 --> 14:21.290
And you thought a bull
in the castle

14:21.290 --> 14:23.040
was a good idea why?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
Okay, Bobo go bye-bye.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.290
Follow that monkey!

14:29.040 --> 14:31.080
You asked for it,
you got it.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.880
The Loop.

14:34.830 --> 14:38.460
ZANIES: All hail
King Mateo!

14:38.460 --> 14:40.790
MATEO: I'm the royal wizard
of Avalor.

14:40.790 --> 14:42.880
You're a royal
wizard, too?!

14:42.880 --> 14:46.000
ALL: All hail
Wizard King Mateo!

14:46.000 --> 14:47.670
You see what
we're up against?

14:47.670 --> 14:49.170
If they think
he's their king,

14:49.170 --> 14:50.960
they're not gonna
let us near him.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.040
Can you move fast
like Zuzo?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.670
Yeah, but not if
I'm carrying you.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.750
And I need to hold on
to both of you to bring
you back to your world.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.000
Well, then you'll have to
get him on your own

15:02.000 --> 15:05.120
- and bring him up here.
- But he doesn't know
who I am.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.920
He's not gonna let me
just whisk him away.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.420
Okay. I'll just have to
let him know you're with me

15:11.420 --> 15:13.000
without tipping off
the Zanies.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.710
Hmm.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.420
Uh...

15:16.420 --> 15:18.290
Okay, here's the plan.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.330
I'll shoot my earring
at Mateo to get his attention.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.080
When he sees me,
you swoop down

15:22.080 --> 15:23.920
scoop him up,
and off we go.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.920
Great! There's only
one thing wrong with that plan.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.500
- I'm part of it.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.380
Oh, come on.
I know you can do this.

15:33.380 --> 15:36.120
Well, that makes
one of us.

15:41.250 --> 15:45.040
Oh! Whoa!

15:46.620 --> 15:49.880
It's time our king
meets the Shadow Spirit.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.880
ALL: Shadow Spirits,
Shadow Spirits.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.670
The Shadow Spirits?

15:53.670 --> 15:55.500
Oh, they're coming.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.040
We have to hurry.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.500
Practice shot.
Just gotta try again.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.540
Elena?

16:09.540 --> 16:11.000
Sh!

16:13.420 --> 16:14.540
Now!

16:14.540 --> 16:15.880
Uh...

16:15.880 --> 16:18.080
Cacahuate, they're
getting away.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.540
Go. On three.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.040
One, two...

16:23.500 --> 16:25.830
- Three!

16:25.830 --> 16:27.290
Just go.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.540
Got him.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.250
What was that?

16:42.250 --> 16:43.830
We must protect
the king.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.290
No!

16:49.500 --> 16:51.790
I told you
I couldn't do it.

16:51.790 --> 16:53.250
Where are they
taking him?

16:53.250 --> 16:55.210
Into the shadow tunnels.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.460
Once they're inside,

16:57.460 --> 16:59.080
they could
pop out anywhere,

16:59.080 --> 17:00.830
or be lost forever.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.920
Then we have to stop them
before they get there.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.880
Oh, what's the point?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.920
Look at me,
look at me!

17:06.920 --> 17:09.080
I'm just a big,
furry failure.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.750
Listen, I know
you're a spirit guide,

17:11.750 --> 17:12.960
but let me give
you some advice.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.210
You're only a failure
if you give up.

17:15.210 --> 17:18.120
- Don't you care
about Mateo?
- Oh, I love the kid.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.710
Then be his
spirit guide.
Help me save him.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.080
But what if
I blow it again?

17:24.080 --> 17:25.960
What if you don't?

17:25.960 --> 17:28.040
You can't let
fear of failing stop you.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.210
You just have to believe
you can do this.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.000
Now I vowed to do
whatever it took

17:32.000 --> 17:34.880
to save my friend,
so I'm going out there,

17:34.880 --> 17:36.330
whether you come
or not.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.960
I can get us over
there quicker, princess.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.250
And I think
I have a plan

17:48.250 --> 17:50.710
that isn't a complete
waste of time.

17:50.710 --> 17:53.250
Look at you,
being all positive.

17:53.250 --> 17:57.580
- Ha! Now here, put
these on your head.
!

17:57.580 --> 17:59.830
Maybe we could meet
the Shadow Spirits later.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.580
ELENA: Guys, stop right there!

18:05.170 --> 18:06.580
Who are you?

18:06.580 --> 18:09.920
I am Elena,
queen of the Zanies.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.580
Queen?
We don't have a queen.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.380
You do now.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.750
Isn't that right,
King Mateo?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.250
Uh, yes, that's right,
Princess... I mean,

18:19.250 --> 18:21.880
Queen Elena.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.830
Wow. We have a king
and a queen?

18:23.830 --> 18:25.540
Yes!

18:25.540 --> 18:27.830
And I would like
to take a walk with my king.

18:27.830 --> 18:28.750
Anything you want,
Your Highness.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.710
Right after we introduce you
to the Shadow Spirits.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.710
Quick, take my hand.

18:41.710 --> 18:42.920
No!

18:42.920 --> 18:44.880
Bring me back
to him.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.830
Oh, I can't reach him.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.960
Oh, uh...

18:51.960 --> 18:54.290
It's now or never.
I've gotta save 'em.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.210
Quick, take my paw, kid.

18:59.210 --> 19:01.040
ZANIES: Stop him!

19:08.250 --> 19:10.750
Ready to go home?

19:10.750 --> 19:11.920
Any time!

19:18.830 --> 19:20.960
- Bummer.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.210
I did it.

19:41.210 --> 19:42.500
Hey, you found him!

19:42.500 --> 19:45.040
- I'll take that.
- Bobo!

19:45.040 --> 19:46.500
I almost had him.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.120
- Use your scepter
to find him.
- Right.

19:50.830 --> 19:52.000
Reveal.

19:54.330 --> 19:55.920
He's in the library.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.540
Oh, what's he reading?

20:02.830 --> 20:05.000
"How to remove
stuck helmet."

20:05.000 --> 20:06.960
Quick, blast the mázico.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.580
- Esteban's too close.
What if I miss?

20:14.670 --> 20:16.420
Blaze!

20:20.210 --> 20:22.040
Elena, watch what
you're doing with that thing.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
Hi, cousin.
Bye, cousin.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.210
Oh!

20:30.040 --> 20:32.080
Sorry, Bobo. We're gonna
have to take you back.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.830
Aww.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.250
I guess I'm not very good
at helping people, am I?

20:36.250 --> 20:37.920
- No.
- Terrible.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.420
Worst I've seen.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.120
You know what, though?

20:43.120 --> 20:46.000
I think there's something else
you might be very good at.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.830
All hail the new
king of the Zanies!

20:49.830 --> 20:52.210
ALL: King Bobo!

20:52.210 --> 20:54.290
I like the sound of that.

20:54.290 --> 20:55.830
Elena figured
your kind of advice

20:55.830 --> 20:57.790
would be
perfect for them.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.670
Thanks, Zuzo.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.880
Now let's go meet
those Shadow Spirits.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.000
Well, that's all
taken care of.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.920
Multi-world crisis
averted.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.080
Mateo, I'd like you
to meet Cacahuate,

21:15.080 --> 21:16.960
your spirit guide.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.880
Oh, mighty chanul.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.420
Thank you for
honoring me with your guidance.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.500
Mateo, your friend here
honored me with
the best guidance

21:25.500 --> 21:27.000
I've heard
in centuries.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.710
I did?

21:28.710 --> 21:31.000
If it wasn't for you,
I would've given up.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.830
- Aw, you helped
her, too, you know.

21:34.830 --> 21:38.210
You weren't the only one
who needed to keep trying.
till you got it right.

21:38.210 --> 21:41.420
That's why you said
I should come to
the spirit world.

21:41.420 --> 21:43.920
You are one crafty
spirit fox, Zuzo.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.330
Ah, just doin' my job.

21:46.330 --> 21:49.460
And speaking of that,
we better get back
to it, Cacahuate.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.120
You know what, Zuzo?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.830
I'm actually
looking forward to it.

21:52.830 --> 21:55.620
That's the spirit.
See what I did there?

21:55.620 --> 21:58.120
Thanks for coming
after me, Elena.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.880
Any time, Mateo.
