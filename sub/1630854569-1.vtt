Oh, no.
That would be much too easy.

want?

DOMINIQUE: I am here, Alexis,
to give you something

04:24.138 --> 04:25.941
you would never give me:

04:26.041 --> 04:27.879
fair warning.

04:27.979 --> 04:30.416
Oh, how ominous.

later...

I'm running late.

NIECY: It's okay.
Where are you?

04:47.718 --> 04:50.624
I'll be right there.
I got distracted. I'm so
sorry.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.628
NIECY: Take your time.
We just got here.

04:52.762 --> 04:53.664

Alan, it's only
been 15 minutes.

05:02.882 --> 05:03.951
"Only."

05:07.959 --> 05:09.662

finding a card.

05:09.762 --> 05:12.033
Oh, no! It's all
right, sweetie.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.804
-Hi!
-Hi.

05:13.904 --> 05:16.977
Oh! Look at you.
What a pretty dress.

05:17.077 --> 05:18.346
-Thank you.
-Hey!

05:18.446 --> 05:19.114
Hi, Uncle Alan.

Hi, Dana.

05:20.884 --> 05:22.822
(light laughter)

05:22.956 --> 05:27.532
So, Dana, you know, I have
to say, we were a little
shocked

05:27.666 --> 05:30.103
to hear only yesterday
that you were in town.

05:30.203 --> 05:33.476
I wish you'd given us a heads
-up that you were planning a
trip.

05:33.577 --> 05:35.346
-We could have helped.
-It's okay. It's okay.

05:35.446 --> 05:37.350
Where are you even staying?

05:37.618 --> 05:40.356
Okay, yeah,
that's actually the thing.

05:40.456 --> 05:43.697
I... bought a house.

05:43.931 --> 05:44.999
(chuckles)

05:45.099 --> 05:46.435
-Yeah.
-What?

05:46.536 --> 05:48.039
Surprise! (laughs)

05:48.139 --> 05:51.580
Wait. What do you mean
you bought a house? Where?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.017
Here. I'm--
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

05:54.117 --> 05:57.625
Wait, wait. How did you
buy a house without a job?

05:58.059 --> 06:00.430
-I sold the brownstone.
-NIECY: What?

06:00.531 --> 06:01.833
-You what?
-DANA: I know. I know.

06:01.933 --> 06:03.770
I thought it would take,
like, at least a year,

06:03.870 --> 06:05.574
and it went in like a weekend.

06:05.674 --> 06:07.143
The markets over there
are so crazy right now.

06:07.243 --> 06:09.716
-Whoa, whoa--
Sold it for how much?
-Enough.

06:09.816 --> 06:12.020
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait a minute.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.460
Um, when did this all happen?

06:15.595 --> 06:18.800
Last month, but
we just closed.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.438
You--
You already bought a house?

06:22.040 --> 06:25.113
Yeah, well, I mean, it kind
of happened at the same time.

06:25.213 --> 06:27.050
I've been thinking
about this for a while,

06:27.150 --> 06:30.891
and the realtor knew someone
out here who knew someone
and...

06:31.158 --> 06:33.095
it's actually
a really cute little house.

06:33.195 --> 06:34.933
It's near Silver Lake.

06:35.033 --> 06:37.838
They did this virtual tour
where you can see all the
amenities.

06:37.938 --> 06:40.511
You mean you bought it
without even seeing it?

06:40.611 --> 06:41.913
I mean, I-- I saw it online.

06:42.013 --> 06:43.684
Wait a minute. You bought this
off the Internet?

06:43.784 --> 06:45.053
-DANA: Yes.
-Oh, Lord.

06:45.153 --> 06:46.890
DANA: And it's
actually not that serious.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.627
-NIECY: Alan--
-Why are you acting like this?

06:48.761 --> 06:49.829
Because that's
her mother's house you sold.

06:49.929 --> 06:51.633
Yeah, and Grandma
left it to me,

06:51.733 --> 06:53.169
so it was mine to do
whatever I wanted with.

06:53.303 --> 06:54.939
NIECY: Hey, everybody stop.
All right? Please.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.179
Are we, uh, ready to order?

06:58.313 --> 06:59.782
Oh, no, no, no, thank you.

06:59.882 --> 07:01.686
Just in a few minutes.

07:01.786 --> 07:03.055
ALAN: Yes, please.

07:03.155 --> 07:04.892
NIECY: Oh, how about you
chill on the wine?

07:05.026 --> 07:06.896
ALAN: She's the one
that needs to chill.

07:06.996 --> 07:08.967
That's a two million
dollar house.
Are you insane?

07:09.067 --> 07:10.036
Alan...

07:10.705 --> 07:12.742
why don't you take a minute?

07:24.298 --> 07:26.068
I'm confused.

07:26.202 --> 07:27.838
I thought you'd be...

07:28.974 --> 07:31.813
I mean, you always said
how you wished I was closer.

07:31.913 --> 07:33.950
It's not like there was
anything left for me in New
York.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.090
I mean, you're the only
family I have left.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.593
(chuckles)

07:38.693 --> 07:40.096
Of course, Dana.

07:42.568 --> 07:43.904
This is just...

07:44.205 --> 07:45.239
(chuckles lightly)

07:45.339 --> 07:47.812
It's-- it's a lot to take in.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.249
-I thought you'd be excited.
-NIECY: I am.

07:50.349 --> 07:51.953
We are.

07:52.487 --> 07:54.091
Okay, it's-- it's just...

07:54.191 --> 07:55.961
It's-- it's a lot.

07:57.565 --> 07:59.769
But let's order, okay?

08:00.103 --> 08:01.673
And then I want
to hear your plan

08:01.773 --> 08:03.510
because I know we're cute,

08:03.610 --> 08:04.979
but we're not cute enough

08:05.079 --> 08:07.217
to be the only reason
for you to up and move.

08:07.317 --> 08:09.689
Well, actually,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.728
I'm trying to break
into writing for television.

08:12.828 --> 08:14.932
-Televi--
-(Alan sighing)

08:16.570 --> 08:17.938
Better.

08:19.742 --> 08:20.911
NIECY: Can we...

08:21.245 --> 08:25.153
Yeah, let's-- let's--
Can we order? Thank you.

08:29.863 --> 08:31.766
Are you sure
you don't want a ride?

08:31.866 --> 08:33.703
Yeah, I've got it covered.

08:33.803 --> 08:34.939
-Are you sure?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.876
-Are you sure?
-(Alan sighing)

08:36.976 --> 08:40.684
Oh, wait.
Why don't you, um,
text me the address

08:40.784 --> 08:42.988
and uh, the hospital
is over that way.

08:43.088 --> 08:46.261
I can swing by
tomorrow before my shift.

08:46.496 --> 08:48.065
Of course.

08:48.432 --> 08:50.637
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:51.071 --> 08:53.042
I will see you tomorrow.
You take care.

08:53.142 --> 08:54.812
Are you sure
you don't want a ride?

08:54.912 --> 08:55.881
-Yes.
-Okay. Come on. Okay.

08:55.981 --> 08:57.651
I got it. Thank you.

08:57.751 --> 08:59.121
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:59.221 --> 09:00.691
Bye.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.997
Nightmare.

09:11.646 --> 09:13.249
(footsteps)

09:13.349 --> 09:14.886
Hi. Excuse me.

09:14.986 --> 09:16.790
I'm trying to call an Uber,
and my phone died.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.860
Um, do you have
a charger I can borrow?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.764
Sorry, honey,
we don't do that here.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.139
Um, I've got
a charger in my car.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.143
But you heading east or west?

09:28.179 --> 09:30.082
Um, Silver Lake.

09:30.316 --> 09:33.690
Okay. I'm headed that way.
I can give you a ride.

09:36.763 --> 09:40.971
I mean, it's gonna be a lot
quicker than me going to my
car,

09:41.071 --> 09:43.342
getting the charger,
charging the phone,

09:43.442 --> 09:46.114
and then waiting for some
other stranger with a car

09:46.214 --> 09:47.250
to pick you up.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.356
What's your name?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.093
Dana.

09:52.193 --> 09:53.129
Okay, cool.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.072
Hey, everyone, it's Kevin.
I work here.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.109
Okay, this is Dana.

10:00.343 --> 10:03.349
She's having a bad night.
She needs a ride home.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.153
Um, she's worried
I'm a murderer.

10:05.253 --> 10:08.025
So, if she goes missing,
tell the cops it was me, okay?

10:08.125 --> 10:11.866
It was Kevin, the
waiter/murderer who works
here.

10:15.941 --> 10:17.711
Good. You feel better?

10:17.811 --> 10:18.847
No.

10:19.114 --> 10:20.751
Okay, cool. Get in my car.

10:20.851 --> 10:22.721
I'm kidding. Do you wanna go?

10:23.557 --> 10:28.098
So, were those incredibly
attractive people your
parents?

10:28.232 --> 10:29.969
Aunt and uncle.

10:30.336 --> 10:32.073
Oh, they seem nice.

10:33.844 --> 10:37.985
Yeah, I was kind of catching
on to those tough dinner
vibes.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.323
DANA: Yeah.

10:40.423 --> 10:42.995
-Think I made a mistake
though. -KEVIN: Uh-oh. What
was it?

10:43.129 --> 10:44.832
DANA: Thinking they'd
be happy to see me.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.170
She's actually pretty decent.

10:47.672 --> 10:50.243
She was pretty fun growing up.
(chuckles)

10:50.745 --> 10:53.015
-He's the problem.
-Oh, yeah?

10:54.251 --> 10:55.988
She used to be
his trophy wife,

10:56.088 --> 10:59.962
and now she's just, like,
his home health aide.

11:03.169 --> 11:04.839
Uncle Alan.

11:04.939 --> 11:06.809
He used to be a cop, actually.

11:06.909 --> 11:08.880
-Ooh, yikes.
-Yeah.

11:13.022 --> 11:15.126
Maybe you have
relatives like that.

11:15.226 --> 11:16.763
Former cops?

11:16.863 --> 11:18.365
No, like...

11:19.936 --> 11:22.240
Bummers. Like...

11:22.675 --> 11:24.277
no matter what you do,
it's wrong.

11:24.377 --> 11:25.914
Hmm.

11:26.549 --> 11:29.387
No. No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:29.487 --> 11:33.229
My-- my entire family
loves me unconditionally.

11:33.329 --> 11:35.901
They're also totally obsessed
with the fact that I'm a
waiter.

11:36.001 --> 11:38.305
-(chuckling)
-So, uh, I'm joking.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.180
-This is your car?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:42.314 --> 11:44.050
-(keys jingling)
-My maroon-mobile? Yeah.

11:44.184 --> 11:46.054
Um, it's the
nicest thing I own.

11:46.154 --> 11:48.425
Left to me
by a very awesome grandpa.

11:48.526 --> 11:50.162
One second.

11:51.332 --> 11:52.433
Thank you.

11:56.342 --> 11:57.978
-Here's the charger right
here. -Thanks.

11:58.078 --> 11:59.782
(music playing softly)

11:59.882 --> 12:01.351
KEVIN: I'm Kevin, by the way.

12:01.451 --> 12:02.888
DANA: Hi, Kevin.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.073
So, you're new here.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.044
How can you tell?

12:14.245 --> 12:18.118
Um, someone lied to you
and told you that
you live in Silver Lake.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.389
I just moved from Brooklyn.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.026
Oh, no shit? Brooklyn's cool.

12:22.126 --> 12:23.897
Yeah, I actually
went to school in New York.

12:24.131 --> 12:27.036
You know, you actually
seem so familiar.

12:29.408 --> 12:33.115
You ever been to, uh,
North Six in Williamsburg?

12:33.215 --> 12:34.986
-No.
-Oh, well,

12:35.120 --> 12:38.493
I used to play
there in my band.

12:42.968 --> 12:45.272
You got a lot
of friends in L.A.?

12:48.012 --> 12:50.116
DANA: No. Just me.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.391
It's the blue
door on the right.

12:56.095 --> 12:57.865
KEVIN: Ooh, nice house.
What do you do again?

12:57.999 --> 12:59.134
DANA: I'm a writer.

12:59.936 --> 13:01.873
-Thanks for the ride.
-Yeah, sure.

13:01.973 --> 13:04.210
Welcome to L.A., and, you
know, if you ever need a...

13:04.310 --> 13:07.851
-Ow! Ow!
-Oh, shit. Are you okay?

13:08.118 --> 13:09.421
I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:11.392 --> 13:12.961
What the fuck?

13:14.398 --> 13:15.867
-Ow.
-KEVIN: Should kind of just--

13:15.967 --> 13:17.337
I can just help you up.

13:17.437 --> 13:19.274
DANA: No, no. I'm good.
It's these dumb shoes.

13:19.408 --> 13:21.244
-KEVIN: Okay.
-DANA: Thanks.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.550
(keys jangling)

13:27.390 --> 13:28.325
Uh, Dana?

13:30.163 --> 13:31.999
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

13:34.539 --> 13:37.210
-Are these supposed to be
here? -What?

13:38.279 --> 13:39.915
Uh, no, that's trash.

13:40.049 --> 13:41.451
The movers
accidentally packed them.

13:41.552 --> 13:42.588
Seriously?

13:42.688 --> 13:44.190
I don't have a
way to play them.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.395
-You want some of them?
-Yeah. Are you sure?

13:46.496 --> 13:47.965
Yeah.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.002
Cool. Thank you.

13:52.508 --> 13:54.444
(door unlocking)

13:54.545 --> 13:56.616
Oh! (exclaims)

13:56.716 --> 13:58.285
What?

14:01.559 --> 14:04.097
Luther fuckin' Vandross?

14:13.082 --> 14:14.985
Oh, my gosh.

14:15.085 --> 14:16.989
Grace Jones.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.595
DOMINIQUE:
You adore the South of France

14:19.729 --> 14:22.601
even though you are prone
to seasickness on yachts.

14:23.035 --> 14:25.272
ALEXIS:
Only small yachts.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.477
Anything else?

14:27.578 --> 14:29.214
DOMINIQUE:
You were actually expelled

14:29.314 --> 14:31.218
from a boarding school
in Gstaad,

14:31.318 --> 14:33.088
and you worked
for several months

14:33.222 --> 14:36.294
as an artist model
in Hamburg of all places.

14:36.394 --> 14:39.635
ALEXIS: Wrong,
it was Brussels of all places.

14:39.735 --> 14:42.240
And it's all absolute trivia.

14:42.374 --> 14:44.410
DOMINIQUE: All right,
on a deeper level,

14:44.511 --> 14:47.450
you are extremely vulnerable
when it comes to your children

14:47.551 --> 14:49.922
and totally ruthless
when it comes to your enemies.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.093
(Dana groans)

14:52.193 --> 14:54.932
Champagne was obviously frozen
in the bottle at some point.

14:55.032 --> 14:56.468
(glasses clink)

14:56.569 --> 14:58.540
-(phone chirps)
-ALEXIS: If the champagne

14:58.640 --> 15:01.144
is too bland for your taste,
Ms. Deveraux, don't drink it.

15:01.244 --> 15:03.415
The caviar, I
trust, is not bad.

15:03.516 --> 15:05.352
DOMINIQUE:
I really wouldn't know.

15:05.452 --> 15:09.127
This is osetrova, and I prefer
Petrossian beluga.

15:10.764 --> 15:13.402
ALEXIS: Look, Ms. Deveraux,
whatever it is

15:13.503 --> 15:15.540
-that you're doing in
Denver... -(Dana groans)

15:15.640 --> 15:18.613
...I suggest that you tread
very carefully with me.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.388
(crickets chirping)

15:26.496 --> 15:28.533
(baby fussing)

15:45.567 --> 15:47.470
(fussing continues)

16:10.283 --> 16:14.090
(fussing continues)

16:40.711 --> 16:42.380
WOMAN: Miss, can I
get you something?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.417
WOMAN 2: I heard Rufus
in the nursery.

16:44.518 --> 16:46.221
WOMAN 1: I didn't
hear anything.

16:46.321 --> 16:48.425
-WOMAN 2: Well, I did.
-You go on back to bed.

16:48.526 --> 16:50.396
-Something could be--
-Hey!

16:50.497 --> 16:52.400
Don't you wake
up your husband.

16:52.501 --> 16:56.241
If he catch you up like this,
he'll knock us both around.

16:56.776 --> 16:59.480
You know he don't like seeing
you still fussy about that
baby.

16:59.581 --> 17:01.284
Now, I was just in there
a moment ago,

17:01.384 --> 17:02.654
and that child is fine.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.594
But I will go check on him
since you heard something.

17:05.995 --> 17:07.598
You go on back to bed.

17:07.698 --> 17:10.035
Child will never learn
to sleep through the night

17:10.135 --> 17:12.173
if you keep disturbing him
like this.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.489
DANA: He was on his stomach.

17:21.893 --> 17:23.428
I turned him over.

17:26.134 --> 17:27.504
Hello?

17:29.307 --> 17:30.442
Who's there?

17:32.581 --> 17:36.187
I said,
who is that hiding there?

17:37.624 --> 17:38.626
He...

17:39.227 --> 17:41.264
He couldn't breathe. I...

17:43.168 --> 17:44.571
I turned him over.

17:45.674 --> 17:47.209
Who is that?

17:49.815 --> 17:51.351
It's Dana.

17:55.292 --> 17:57.363
Dana.

18:00.202 --> 18:04.277
(both screaming)

18:04.377 --> 18:06.515
(Dana screaming)

18:31.499 --> 18:33.836
NIECY: This is a lot of house
for one person.

18:33.970 --> 18:35.607
-(chuckles)
-Is it?

18:36.943 --> 18:38.445
Yes.

18:40.049 --> 18:45.860
But between this
and the brownstone, there
has to be some money left
over.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.764
-Correct?
-Correct.

18:49.234 --> 18:50.770
And what's the plans for it?

18:52.407 --> 18:56.381
I don't know. Live until
I figure out how to get hired?

18:57.283 --> 18:58.786
(Niecy sighs)

18:58.886 --> 19:01.726
I feel bad I left you
to handle so much on your own.

19:02.394 --> 19:04.932
You know, your grandmother
and I had our issues,

19:05.032 --> 19:08.271
but that grief still happened,

19:08.371 --> 19:11.211
and I'm sorry I couldn't
pull myself out of it

19:11.311 --> 19:12.413
and be more present for you.

19:12.514 --> 19:15.352
-It was fine.
-No, it wasn't.

19:17.958 --> 19:20.730
But now I want to help.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.607
All right,
so where are your towels?

19:26.542 --> 19:29.213
And, um, your bath mat?

19:29.848 --> 19:31.819
And your shower curtains?

19:31.919 --> 19:34.390
I just got here, Niecy.
Got to give me a minute.

19:34.490 --> 19:35.960
NIECY: Okay, but when's
the last time you showered?

19:36.060 --> 19:39.635
And what is your comforter
doing out here on the floor?

19:39.769 --> 19:41.237
DANA: Oh, God.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.843
I actually woke up out here.

19:43.943 --> 19:45.279
NIECY: You did?

19:45.647 --> 19:47.450
Yeah, I think
I was sleepwalking.

19:47.551 --> 19:49.788
-NIECY: Sleepwalking?
-DANA: Yeah.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.792
I had a dream.

19:52.861 --> 19:54.898
About my mother of all people.

19:54.998 --> 19:56.836
But it wasn't
her. She, like...

19:58.305 --> 20:00.375
attacked me, and
then I woke up.

20:01.478 --> 20:03.649
It's so weird.
I can't explain it.

20:04.484 --> 20:07.691
Okay, Dana. So, real talk?

20:07.791 --> 20:11.331
I am not feeling great
about all of this.

20:11.999 --> 20:13.603
In fact, I'm worried.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.405
About?

20:15.540 --> 20:18.679
Doesn't any of this strike you
as a little impulsive?

20:20.517 --> 20:23.288
Giving everything away
and moving in here

20:23.388 --> 20:27.931
without telling anybody,
without even a bed ready.

20:28.031 --> 20:31.404
You didn't think it might
be worth it
to give folks a heads-up?

20:31.505 --> 20:33.676
Why would I need
to give you a heads-up?

20:34.177 --> 20:37.483
I was sitting up
in that big house by myself

20:37.584 --> 20:40.857
for a whole year
not hearing from anybody.

20:41.425 --> 20:43.563
I have my own life to live,
you know.

20:43.663 --> 20:45.867
No one's saying you don't
have your life to live.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.573
Is all this because Grandma
didn't leave the house to you?

20:48.673 --> 20:50.710
Are you mad?
Is this about money?

20:50.810 --> 20:53.315
Uh, I was a part
of that decision,

20:53.415 --> 20:55.018
-for your information,
-DANA: Really?

20:55.118 --> 20:56.321
so no, actually.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.924
Okay, what decision?

20:59.394 --> 21:01.297
Leaving the house to you.

21:01.832 --> 21:03.368
My mother felt
you needed some stability

21:03.468 --> 21:05.005
because she was
concerned about you,

21:05.105 --> 21:10.315
and now I understand why
because this is feeling very
familiar.

21:10.415 --> 21:11.986
Familiar?

21:12.086 --> 21:13.890
Listen, I loved your mother.

21:14.592 --> 21:16.862
Olivia was like
a sister to me,

21:17.564 --> 21:20.369
but her mind was very fragile.

21:20.938 --> 21:24.745
I think if Olivia
had been given some stability,

21:25.046 --> 21:26.749
maybe she would still be here.

21:26.849 --> 21:30.489
-She and my brother both.
-Wow. Okay, this is too much.

21:31.325 --> 21:32.727
Some things
can be genetic, Dana.

21:32.861 --> 21:34.932
-Wow!
-They could be in the blood.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.735
Wow! Really?

21:39.608 --> 21:42.479
If anyone's crazy,
it's definitely you.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.352
-Excuse me?
-I don't know why
I ever believed

21:45.452 --> 21:48.492
that you actually gave
a shit about me or anyone
other than yourself.

21:48.626 --> 21:52.500
I don't know why I ever
believed a word
that came out of your mouth.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.504
"Oh, we'd love
to have you out here, Dana."

21:54.604 --> 21:56.508
"Come out here
whenever you're ready."

21:56.608 --> 21:58.779
You said that!
But you know what?

22:00.449 --> 22:01.919
(exhales sharply) It's okay.

22:02.353 --> 22:04.658
It's okay 'cause
I don't really need you.

22:04.925 --> 22:08.365
Now, I have my own money
and I can take care of myself.

22:08.465 --> 22:09.668
I don't need you.

22:09.768 --> 22:12.373
-NIECY: Okay.
-I don't need you.

22:12.473 --> 22:14.678
Okay, well,
what I don't need is this.

22:14.778 --> 22:16.649
Because I am working
a double shift today,

22:16.749 --> 22:19.053
-so I'mma go.
-DANA: Okay, please. Leave.

22:19.153 --> 22:21.525
You know what your problem is?
You think you know everything.

22:21.659 --> 22:23.796
Well, you know what?
When all that money you got

22:23.896 --> 22:25.934
selling my mother's house
runs out,

22:26.068 --> 22:28.438
let's see whose door
you come knocking on,
princess.

22:28.539 --> 22:30.409
DANA: Princess. Really?

22:30.510 --> 22:33.683
If you wanna see a princess,
why don't you take a look
in the mirror?

22:33.817 --> 22:35.553
-Oh, girl.
-DANA: How about that?

22:35.653 --> 22:37.557
You need to get a grip
before you come for me,

22:37.657 --> 22:39.427
because this is not okay.

22:39.528 --> 22:42.534
You are not okay!

22:44.905 --> 22:45.940
(door slams)

22:46.040 --> 22:47.544
Take a shower!

22:50.650 --> 22:52.854
(water running)

22:57.631 --> 22:59.735
(faucet squeaks,
water stops running)

23:30.530 --> 23:34.136
(phone clicking)

23:41.886 --> 23:44.090
(woman speaking
indistinctly on radio)

23:47.229 --> 23:48.633
Hi.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.737
Hi. (chuckles)

23:50.837 --> 23:52.674
You know, if you really plan
on being an Angeleno,

23:52.774 --> 23:54.010
you got to get a car.

23:54.144 --> 23:56.014
DANA:
Actually don't have a license.

23:56.114 --> 23:57.751
What?

23:57.851 --> 23:59.755
This is what happens
when you grow up in the city.

23:59.889 --> 24:01.892
-KEVIN: The city!
-(Dana chuckling)

24:01.992 --> 24:04.063
KEVIN: New Yorkers kill me
with that "the city" stuff.

24:04.163 --> 24:06.902
There's like a million cities
in the world.

24:07.002 --> 24:09.508
WOMAN ON RADIO: I know. I
mean, this is the second
debate--

24:09.608 --> 24:10.843
Can we listen to
something else?

24:10.943 --> 24:13.181
Yes. Oh, please, God, save me.
Yes.

24:13.281 --> 24:15.085
(radio tuning)

24:16.154 --> 24:18.526
(pop music playing)

24:34.157 --> 24:35.993
You know this song
is terrible, right?

24:36.093 --> 24:37.196
Uh, okay.

24:45.145 --> 24:46.615
This is genius.

24:46.715 --> 24:48.886
(mid-tempo music playing)

24:52.193 --> 24:53.529
What is this?

24:53.796 --> 24:56.802
Your trash,
which is now my treasure.

24:56.936 --> 25:00.710
I was actually getting a
little worried that you were
gonna take your records back

25:00.810 --> 25:03.114
after that horrible,
horrible message.

25:03.214 --> 25:04.951
I still might.

25:05.953 --> 25:08.826
So, let me hear
about this band you were in.

25:10.195 --> 25:12.099
Uh, it's a long story.

25:13.068 --> 25:14.604
Get started.

25:17.644 --> 25:21.250
KEVIN: And, uh, no,
being a Subway sandwich artist
was not my calling.

25:21.350 --> 25:25.025
And then the punk scene
fell apart, and that's why
I left the Bay Area.

25:25.125 --> 25:26.829
And I came down here,

25:26.963 --> 25:29.100
and I played in a couple
bullshit indie bands for a
while

25:29.200 --> 25:31.037
and we toured a little bit,
which was fun

25:31.137 --> 25:33.141
until it got to be too much
and I had to quit

25:33.241 --> 25:35.145
because those fuckers
weren't serious enough for me.

25:35.245 --> 25:37.116
I probably should've
just moved to Brooklyn

25:37.216 --> 25:39.120
like all my friends did,
but whatever.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.290
DANA: I don't think
you missed very much.

25:41.390 --> 25:43.194
KEVIN:
That's nice of you to say.

25:43.294 --> 25:44.731
Do you miss it yet?

25:45.165 --> 25:47.737
-DANA: Brooklyn? Not really.
-KEVIN: Great.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.010
This is a lot of stuff.

25:52.346 --> 25:54.350
Then I got really
into house electronic music,

25:54.450 --> 25:56.053
and, you know, I mean,

25:56.153 --> 25:58.024
sometimes I miss
playing actual instruments,

25:58.158 --> 26:00.596
but it's so much more
interesting to me
compositionally,

26:00.696 --> 26:02.132
and you can just do it
from a laptop.

26:02.266 --> 26:05.005
And then I've just been
working on my E.P. ever since.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.007
How much?

26:06.976 --> 26:08.679
$7,450.

26:09.113 --> 26:10.215
I'll take it.

26:10.950 --> 26:12.052
Whoa.

26:13.956 --> 26:17.162
East side, that's
where you live. Me too.

26:17.564 --> 26:20.837
Downtown. Other side there
is Century City.

26:20.937 --> 26:23.308
Um, and then
rich fuckers' houses.

26:23.408 --> 26:25.680
-(laughs)
-That's pretty much L.A.

26:26.148 --> 26:29.955
Okay, so talk to me
about television.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.992
What about it?

26:32.226 --> 26:33.929
How do you write it?

26:37.269 --> 26:39.306
Oh. (laughs)

26:39.775 --> 26:42.714
Okay, then what kind
of television do you write?

26:42.814 --> 26:43.949
(Dana chuckling)

26:44.049 --> 26:46.187
Um, nothing yet,

26:46.287 --> 26:48.324
but I'm trying to break
into writing for soaps.

26:48.424 --> 26:49.828
Like soap operas?

26:50.229 --> 26:52.232
Do people still
watch soap operas?

26:52.332 --> 26:54.971
It's actually the most watched
form of television in the
world.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.075
But I guess because
the audiences are mostly
women,

26:57.175 --> 26:59.948
no one thinks
anyone actually watches them.

27:01.284 --> 27:02.887
Touché.

27:03.388 --> 27:07.062
I used to watch them all
the time with my grandmother
before she died.

27:07.162 --> 27:08.264
Every day.

27:08.699 --> 27:11.939
General Hospital,
Days of our Lives,

27:12.039 --> 27:13.676
-All My Children.
-Hmm.

27:13.776 --> 27:15.278
She used to
call them her stories.

27:15.378 --> 27:17.115
(Kevin chuckling)

27:17.215 --> 27:19.688
Wait, was this
music Grandma's too?

27:20.055 --> 27:21.692
I don't know who
they belong to.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.863
-Found 'em in a random closet.
-Mmm.

27:24.064 --> 27:27.704
If I had to guess, probably
Dad 'cause it's a lot of
funkadelic.

27:27.804 --> 27:29.139
You should check with him.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.914
Mmm, he's actually dead,
so I-- I can't.

27:34.216 --> 27:35.786
I'm sorry.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.291
My mom too.

27:38.793 --> 27:41.397
-It's fine.
-Yeah, I, uh,

27:41.866 --> 27:44.771
lost both my parents
when I was a kid, too.

27:47.811 --> 27:49.046
Oh.

27:51.217 --> 27:52.286
I'm sorry.

27:55.325 --> 27:58.264
KEVIN: Do you wanna start,
like, an orphan club?

28:00.235 --> 28:01.872
(Dana laughing)

28:07.984 --> 28:10.756
Hey, um, do you need help
with any of that stuff?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.727
-Actually, yes.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:13.228 --> 28:15.265
But let me pay you
for, like, gas or something.

28:15.365 --> 28:19.139
No, no, no.
We're in the orphan
club together now.

28:19.641 --> 28:23.882
Orphans don't pay other
orphans. They barter.

28:24.283 --> 28:25.920
With trauma.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.826
(pop music playing)

28:32.266 --> 28:33.902
That is a bed.

29:14.417 --> 29:16.253
So, what's my star rating?

29:16.353 --> 29:18.224
Four stars.

29:21.431 --> 29:23.067
Four and a half.

29:24.604 --> 29:26.073
I...

29:28.344 --> 29:29.948
Rude.

29:31.284 --> 29:32.987
Okay, do-over.

29:37.062 --> 29:39.099
Is this your writing?

29:40.937 --> 29:44.276
No, I'm diagraming Dynasty.

29:45.045 --> 29:46.313
-What?
-Yeah.

29:46.413 --> 29:49.386
So, there's this book
that kind of teaches you

29:49.486 --> 29:50.523
how to write for television.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.394
So, um...

29:53.863 --> 29:55.900
you basically
watch an episode,

29:56.201 --> 29:58.505
and you write down
everything everyone does.

29:58.605 --> 30:02.279
So, like, he slaps her,

30:02.379 --> 30:04.249
she runs over the dog,
shit like that,

30:04.349 --> 30:07.322
and then
you break down the actions.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.994
But what is Dynasty?

30:12.099 --> 30:13.569
(chuckling) Are you serious?

30:13.836 --> 30:15.873
You don't know
what Dynasty is?

30:15.973 --> 30:18.579
-No.
-Stop.

30:18.679 --> 30:21.417
-But I can learn.
-Stop.

30:21.518 --> 30:24.423
-I can learn.
-Okay, you know what?

30:24.524 --> 30:25.860
Tonight is your lucky night

41:46.053 --> 41:48.658
You that dead negro
who wants our land.

41:50.629 --> 41:51.998
What did you call me?

41:52.098 --> 41:55.237
I know it was you.
You saved me when I was a
baby.

41:55.337 --> 41:57.008
And then again
when I was drowning.

41:57.108 --> 41:59.580
Mama saw you.
Daddy saw you, too.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.982
I was too little.

42:01.517 --> 42:05.692
Where are we, Rufus?

42:05.792 --> 42:08.665
On our plantation.
Don't you know that?

42:10.168 --> 42:11.136
MAN 1: Rufus!

42:12.172 --> 42:13.541
Where are you,
you little shit?

42:13.675 --> 42:14.977
MAN 2: Easy, boss.
He's just a boy.

42:15.077 --> 42:17.683
MAN 1: Quiet before I beat
the skin off of you too.

42:17.783 --> 42:20.689
I've told him about
playing in that fireplace.

42:21.223 --> 42:23.828
Rufus! Get out here!

42:24.095 --> 42:25.866
Give you
a damn good whipping, boy!

42:25.966 --> 42:27.836
RUFUS: No!
Don't-- Don't leave me!

42:27.936 --> 42:30.007
-MAN 1: Get out here, Rufus.
-RUFUS: No, don't leave me.

42:30.107 --> 42:31.611
You hear me?

42:31.711 --> 42:33.581
RUFUS: He's gon' kill me.
He's gon' kill me!

42:33.715 --> 42:36.721
-MAN 1: Rufus!
-(Dana breathing heavily)

42:49.680 --> 42:51.984
Wake up, Dana. Wake up.

42:52.118 --> 42:53.621
Wake up.

42:56.093 --> 42:58.898
Dana. Dana.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.069
Your name's Dana, right?

43:03.742 --> 43:05.745
I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's okay.

43:06.681 --> 43:07.883
I know Ms. Olivia.

43:09.085 --> 43:09.887
What?

43:09.987 --> 43:11.022
She stay over by Hagar's.

43:11.156 --> 43:12.191
Taking care of her.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.264
You know how to get there?

43:16.834 --> 43:18.738
You walk straight
through these woods.

43:18.838 --> 43:20.174
You'll come to a road.

43:20.274 --> 43:22.746
Turn to your left,
walk a piece past the
crossroad,

43:22.880 --> 43:25.050
and you come up on Hagar's
to your right.

43:25.619 --> 43:28.691
Before you go,
can I ask you a question?

43:30.829 --> 43:32.799
If you're an angel
or something else?

43:37.876 --> 43:39.179
I don't know.

43:42.285 --> 43:43.688
MAN 2: Good luck.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.725
I gotta get back.

44:28.444 --> 44:29.980
-PATROLMAN: Hey.
-(gun cocks)

44:30.080 --> 44:32.719
I see you hiding
in the hedges there.

44:32.819 --> 44:34.823
Come on out in the road now.

44:38.063 --> 44:39.132
Move it.

44:45.444 --> 44:46.747
Get out here!

44:49.352 --> 44:50.855
Hurry up.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.836
Hagar?

44:59.172 --> 45:01.877
Why didn't you say something
when I called?

45:05.952 --> 45:07.889
What you doing out so late?

45:11.964 --> 45:14.870
I couldn't sleep.

45:15.237 --> 45:18.143
You're lucky it's
old Daniel here who found you.

45:19.379 --> 45:21.316
Instead of some
other patroller.

45:22.853 --> 45:25.224
They-- they might take you
for a runaway.

45:27.128 --> 45:30.802
Well, (clicks tongue)
get on your way home now.

45:47.135 --> 45:49.238
It's a real nice dress
you got on there.

45:50.542 --> 45:52.478
Don't wanna get it dirty.

45:53.047 --> 45:56.252
You ought to let me
give you a ride back, huh?

45:57.155 --> 45:58.223
Come on.

46:02.131 --> 46:03.333
Uh...

46:03.601 --> 46:05.170
Uh, no, thank you.

46:14.557 --> 46:16.994
Well, you best be getting
on home now.

46:18.030 --> 46:19.399
It ain't safe out here.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.331
(indistinct conversation)

46:44.917 --> 46:46.353
(knocking on door)

46:49.459 --> 46:51.129
DANA: Hagar?

46:51.931 --> 46:53.100
Yes.

46:53.635 --> 46:55.137
Dana?

46:57.341 --> 46:59.245
Come on inside.

47:06.961 --> 47:08.363
HAGAR: Is this really her?

47:09.466 --> 47:12.873
Yes. I think so.

47:16.948 --> 47:18.985
Is your last name James?

47:19.620 --> 47:21.122
DANA: Yes.

47:22.091 --> 47:23.928
You must be exhausted.

47:25.599 --> 47:27.134
Why don't you sit down?

47:28.671 --> 47:31.209
You need anything?
You need some water
or something?

47:31.309 --> 47:33.881
-Let me go on out
and grab some water.
-No, no.

47:34.550 --> 47:38.290
HAGAR: I need some air, and
you two should have your
privacy.

47:38.390 --> 47:40.895
(woman coughing)

47:40.995 --> 47:42.933
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

47:43.367 --> 47:45.003
Oh, my God.

47:45.103 --> 47:46.439
It's really you.

47:57.094 --> 47:58.463
What year is it?

47:59.432 --> 48:01.035
It's 1815.

48:03.006 --> 48:05.043
What year is it
where you're from?

48:07.649 --> 48:09.385
2016.

48:12.693 --> 48:17.201
But I've been stuck here
for 11, 12 years.

48:18.671 --> 48:20.107
I don't understand.

48:20.474 --> 48:22.478
When I left,
you were barely two.

48:22.746 --> 48:24.449
It was 1993.

48:24.584 --> 48:25.919
Are you a-- a slave?

48:26.053 --> 48:27.455
Oh, no. I'm free.

48:28.157 --> 48:30.093
How'd you know
to find me here?

48:30.628 --> 48:33.534
A slave. A-- A man.

48:34.537 --> 48:37.007
Luke? Bald?

48:37.107 --> 48:40.080
He saw you disappear
at the river years ago.

48:40.481 --> 48:41.517
Quickly,

48:42.753 --> 48:44.990
tell me, how do you do it?

48:46.594 --> 48:48.063
How do you go home?

48:49.332 --> 48:50.502
I don't know how.

48:53.541 --> 48:54.543
I don't know.

48:57.181 --> 48:59.118
What you mean you don't know?

49:00.154 --> 49:02.291
I don't know.
It just happens. I--

49:02.391 --> 49:03.961
What do you mean
it just happens?

49:04.095 --> 49:05.297
I don't know.
I don't-- I don't--

49:05.397 --> 49:07.368
I don't understand
what's happening.

49:09.573 --> 49:11.644
I don't understand
what's happening.

49:11.978 --> 49:14.516
How many times
have you been back and forth?

49:16.654 --> 49:18.023
Three.

49:19.492 --> 49:21.095
How old are you?

49:24.335 --> 49:25.538
26.

49:25.638 --> 49:28.544
I was 26
when this happened to me.

49:30.481 --> 49:32.184
Do you even remember me?

49:34.322 --> 49:36.594
What has your father said
about what happened?

49:38.363 --> 49:39.533
He's dead.

49:41.771 --> 49:43.173
What?

49:44.375 --> 49:47.314
He died in the same crash
you did.

49:48.651 --> 49:49.686
Oh!

49:51.256 --> 49:53.159
(sobbing) Oh, God!

49:56.767 --> 49:58.303
Dana...

50:00.107 --> 50:01.175
who...

50:01.777 --> 50:03.446
Who's been raising you?

50:09.526 --> 50:11.229
I don't understand.

50:13.534 --> 50:15.170
Are you alive?

50:18.143 --> 50:19.513
(woman screaming)

50:20.280 --> 50:21.349
OLIVIA: Oh, my God.

50:21.449 --> 50:23.320
HAGAR: Mr. Daniel, please.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.790
DANIEL: You gotta tell me.

50:25.224 --> 50:29.065
-Shut up! What's going on?
-Please, Mr. Daniel.

50:31.436 --> 50:35.110
Wha-- What kind
of devilment is this?

50:37.516 --> 50:40.622
-We both gonna need to run.
-What?

50:40.722 --> 50:42.458
What'd you say to her?

50:42.559 --> 50:44.095
I said run!

50:46.333 --> 50:49.205
No, you don't. (grunts)
God damn it!

50:49.339 --> 50:51.075
You are the
runaway, ain't you?

50:51.209 --> 50:52.478
Wait 'til they get
a load of this.

50:52.613 --> 50:54.783
What's been going on
in this whore's house?

50:54.883 --> 50:57.622
-(Dana panting)
-(Daniel screaming)

50:57.722 --> 50:59.292
(Daniel groaning)

51:02.164 --> 51:04.468
DANIEL: Get back
here. Get back.

51:08.578 --> 51:10.213
Stop running.

51:10.815 --> 51:12.619
(both grunting)

51:13.320 --> 51:14.623
(Dana shrieking)

51:15.725 --> 51:17.662
Get over there.
Get over there.

51:19.900 --> 51:20.802
Ah!

51:20.902 --> 51:22.304
God damn it!

51:22.404 --> 51:24.308
-(Daniel grunting)
-(Dana screaming)

51:28.751 --> 51:31.289
You know you're gonna
pay for that, don't you?

51:39.372 --> 51:40.508
-Dana.
-KEVIN: Dana!

51:40.642 --> 51:42.779
-DANA: Wait.
-KEVIN: Dana.

51:42.879 --> 51:44.148
(Dana screaming)

51:44.248 --> 51:45.818
Hey, it's-- it's me.

51:45.918 --> 51:47.656
-It's me. It's me.
-(Dana shrieking)

51:47.756 --> 51:49.125
Calm-- calm down.

51:49.225 --> 51:51.730
(grunting)
It's me. It's me.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.809
(Dana sobbing)

51:59.780 --> 52:01.182
I'm crazy.

52:01.282 --> 52:02.719
No, I saw you disappear,

52:02.819 --> 52:04.723
and then you showed up
back here in front of me.

52:04.823 --> 52:08.263
You-- You are not crazy.
Whatever this is, it's real.

52:12.271 --> 52:13.574
It's real.

52:17.749 --> 52:19.285
She's back there.

52:19.787 --> 52:21.289
KEVIN: Who?

52:22.692 --> 52:26.332
Dana, who's back there?

52:27.936 --> 52:29.338
Dana.

52:34.917 --> 52:36.486
DANA: My mother.

52:38.991 --> 52:40.595
She's alive.
