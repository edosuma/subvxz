00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.780 --> 00:30.948
VISION: Wanda.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.492
For two years,
we've stolen these moments

00:33.575 --> 00:35.661
trying to see if this could work and...

00:35.744 --> 00:37.496
I don't know. (STAMMERS)

00:37.579 --> 00:39.581
You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.750
(STAMMERS) I think...

00:41.834 --> 00:43.502
-It works.
-It works. It works.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.464
Stay.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.675
Stay with me.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.684
STRUCKER:
It's not a world of heroes anymore.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.645
This is the age of miracles.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.400
There's nothing more horrifying

01:08.277 --> 01:09.403
than a miracle.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.407
HILL: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.995
Orphaned at 10, they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.205
ROGERS: What kind of monster
would let a German scientist

01:20.289 --> 01:22.291
experiment on them
to protect their country?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.170
The first shell hits,

01:27.296 --> 01:29.715
the whole building
starts coming apart.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.384
And the second shell hits
three feet from our faces.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.846
But it doesn't go off
and on the side of the shell

01:35.929 --> 01:37.306
is painted one word.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.849
"Stark."

01:40.309 --> 01:42.186
BANNER: So you're going
for artificial intelligence,

01:42.269 --> 01:43.604
and you don't wanna tell the team?

01:43.687 --> 01:46.440
STARK: I don't wanna hear the
"man was not meant to meddle" medley.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.483
ULTRON: I'm ready. I'm on mission.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.693
Ultron.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.862
ULTRON: Everyone creates
the thing they dread.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.531
Men of peace create engines of war.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.700
WANDA: I saw Stark's fear.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.411
I knew it would control him.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.499
ULTRON: I can hurt them,
but you will tear them apart.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.629
WANDA: Sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.548
-(ROARS)
-ULTRON: There's only one path to peace.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.678
The Avengers' extinction.

02:16.762 --> 02:21.016
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.560
You said make a better world.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.728
It will be better.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.230
When everyone is dead?

02:32.194 --> 02:34.988
BARTON: It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.865
But if you step out that door...

02:36.949 --> 02:39.117
If you go out there, you fight.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.202
You are an Avenger.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.922
PIETRO: I'm not going to leave you here.
WANDA: I can handle this.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.298
Get the people on the boats.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.688
ROGERS: We try to save
as many people as we can.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.356
Sometimes
that doesn't mean everybody.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.442
But if we can't find a way
to live with that then next time...

03:14.361 --> 03:16.154
Maybe nobody gets saved.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.322
Just like we practiced.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.157
-WANDA: What about the gas?
-Get it out.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.248
ROGERS: Rumlow has a biological weapon.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.499
ROMANOFF: I'm on it.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.293
WANDA: I am something else.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.921
I'm still me, I think, but...

03:33.422 --> 03:35.591
That's not what everyone else sees.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.135
RUMLOW: I've been waiting for this.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.817
ROGERS: The Avengers were formed
to make the world a safer place.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.027
I feel we've done that.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.654
Do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

03:59.281 --> 04:01.491
If I misplaced
a couple of 30 megaton nukes,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.911
you can bet there'd be consequences.

04:04.870 --> 04:05.954
WANDA: They'll come for me.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.831
VISION: We would protect you.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.666
WANDA: I've caused enough problems.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.086
BARTON: Do you wanna mope?
You can go to high school.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.547
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.007
VISION: Clint!

04:17.090 --> 04:18.967
You can't overpower me.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.347
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.307
I'm leaving.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.517
I can't let you.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.187
I'm sorry.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.897
If you do this...

04:33.065 --> 04:35.359
They will never stop being afraid of you.

04:35.442 --> 04:39.279
I can't control their fear, only my own.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.130
(YELLING)

05:01.218 --> 05:03.095
-I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.724
WANDA: We both made promises.
VISION: Not to each other.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.352
Stay.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.354
Stay with me.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.564
(YELLING)

05:15.357 --> 05:16.608
WANDA: You asked me to stay.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.405
I'm staying.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.200
BANNER: If Thanos gets all six stones...

05:25.284 --> 05:27.661
DR. STRANGE: He could destroy life
on a scale undreamt of.

05:31.874 --> 05:32.875
(GRUNTS)

05:38.046 --> 05:39.882
VISION: You have the power
to destroy the stone.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.216
WANDA: I can't.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.594
VISION: If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.179
You could never hurt me.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.111
No!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.740
STRUCKER: There's nothing more horrifying

06:09.703 --> 06:11.580
than a miracle.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.966
THANOS: As long as there are those
that remember what was,

06:24.384 --> 06:27.054
there will always
be those that will resist.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.897
You took everything from me.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.733
THANOS: I don't even know who you are.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.068
You will.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.619
(GRUNTS)

07:06.343 --> 07:08.512
(THANOS YELLING)
