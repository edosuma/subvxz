WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:05.222
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is that the banner

00:05.266 --> 00:06.832
Mom put up for me
when I came home?

00:06.876 --> 00:08.182
Yes, it is.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.531
Can you see
where we changed it?

00:09.574 --> 00:12.142
No.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.188
It's a marvel of engineering.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.320
God bless America.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.758
So, did the Academy hassle you
for taking a couple days off?

00:19.802 --> 00:22.109
No. I told my C.O.
that Mom was having another kid,

00:22.152 --> 00:26.026
so if anyone asks, Jen is
a newborn, and Dad is Asian.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.290
I can't believe Dad agreed

00:29.333 --> 00:31.248
to let a foreign exchange
student live here.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.902
He hates guests.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.338
No, he doesn't.
He loves them.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.645
Every time I talk about
eventually moving out,

00:36.688 --> 00:40.257
he always says
he's "counting the days."

00:40.301 --> 00:41.954
All right, let's go.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.087
I just got a text from your mom.
She's on her way.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.307
Not real good with the emojis,
unless she's actually

00:46.350 --> 00:51.181
bringing a unicorn, an eggplant
and three little turds.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.705
Hey, are you gonna be able to
get through the next six months

00:53.749 --> 00:55.272
with a stranger living
in this house?

00:55.316 --> 00:59.233
Yeah, it's like a horror movie--
It Came from Abroad.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.538
Relax. I'm gonna be fine.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.105
Those two girls'll be talking
to each other.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.107
That means I don't have to talk
to either one of them.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.371
No, I-I think you two
are gonna get super close,

01:07.415 --> 01:09.156
and you're gonna be heartbroken
when she's gone.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.114
Just like me, right, Mr. B?

01:11.158 --> 01:14.378
Yeah. Counting the days, Kyle.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.165
-Oh. Hey, babe.
-Guess who I have with me?

01:18.208 --> 01:21.385
-[laughing]: Hey. Hi.
-I hope it's Jen.
We made a sign.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.126
Hello, everyone.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.954
-Hi, Jen.
It's good to see you again.
-MIKE: Hi, Jen.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.261
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.047
Hong Kong is British, right?

01:33.005 --> 01:35.007
â™ª

01:39.751 --> 01:41.753
Morning, Jen.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.407
-Good morning, Mr. Baxter.
-[laughs]

01:43.451 --> 01:45.453
[groans]

01:52.329 --> 01:55.550
Wow, the coffee looks a lot
like tea.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.161
I'm sorry.
I couldn't find a kettle.

01:58.205 --> 02:01.556
Yeah, I hide the kettle
so no one will make tea.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.863
You're up early.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.301
The early bird.
That's an expression.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.434
I know.
It means I get to eat the worm.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.089
I've learned a lot
of American expressions.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.309
Don't count your chickens,
a bird in the hand,

02:15.352 --> 02:17.267
all your eggs in one basket.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.530
You people learn a lot
of lessons from birds.

02:19.574 --> 02:23.230
You should see us flip them
while we're in traffic.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.409
So, you got the paper.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.367
-Yes, reading the paper helps me
with my English.
-Good.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.457
If I see a word I want
to use more, I circle it.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.590
Hey. Oh, look at that.

02:35.633 --> 02:38.245
You circled "boundaries."
Have you looked that up?

02:40.029 --> 02:42.031
[stammers]

02:50.909 --> 02:54.478
All right. Let's see
what's in the news today.

02:54.522 --> 02:57.351
The stock market's up, voters in
Ohio approved a new racetrack,

02:57.394 --> 03:00.354
and one of the bachelorettes
is back in rehab.

03:00.397 --> 03:04.358
Saved me a little bit of time,
didn't you?

03:04.401 --> 03:06.447
If you'd just finish
the crossword puzzle,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.666
I won't have anything to...
Look it. You've done that.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.016
You finished
the crossword puzzle.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.149
Oh, no.
I'm upsetting your routine.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.325
I hope you don't also
do the sudoku.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.892
Not today.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.156
Morning.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.376
Vanessa! Yay!

03:22.419 --> 03:23.899
Oh, hi.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.162
[laughing]:
Okay.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.643
Oh, my goodness, so,
you're also a morning person.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.514
My, it's a small world.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.560
And a small kitchen.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.521
Hey, the mail came.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.393
It came yesterday, too, Kyle.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.438
That's what mail does.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.135
You know, Mr. Alzate sent away

03:43.179 --> 03:45.355
to this company
to find out his ancestry.

03:45.399 --> 03:49.446
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if in a
previous life he was Cleopatra?

03:49.490 --> 03:52.623
That's not how it works.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.670
And-and he already knows
who his ancestors are.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.499
He tells me twice a day
that they're from

03:58.542 --> 04:01.110
[imitating Ed]: "the great
Basque region of Spain."

04:02.416 --> 04:04.505
Hey, Kyle. Kyle, did it come?

04:04.548 --> 04:07.508
Uh, let's see.
Mr. B, Mr. B. Nah.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.988
It doesn't look like it's here,
Mr. Alzate. Uh, maybe tomorrow.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.990
Oh, damn it.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.079
You know who has
the best mail service?

04:14.123 --> 04:16.517
The great Basque region
of Spain.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.562
Isn't that where
your people are from, Ed?

04:18.606 --> 04:23.132
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
and another little-known fact--

04:23.175 --> 04:25.569
the Basque invented soup.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.224
Oddly enough, a bisque.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.532
Hey, uh, why is it so important
for you to get this report

04:31.575 --> 04:33.534
if you already know
what it's gonna say?

04:33.577 --> 04:34.752
Because I want to be certain.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.319
You don't know who you truly are

04:36.363 --> 04:38.234
unless you know
where you come from.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.671
-Yeah, he's right.
-[chuckles]

04:40.715 --> 04:43.370
For years, I thought
my father was an arsonist.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.372
Mm-hmm.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.375
And then, my mom explained to me
that he was actually a bigamist.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.595
-Talk about relief.
-[laughs]

04:51.639 --> 04:53.380
Hey, hey.
Hey, look here.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.990
On this website,
they have an example

04:55.033 --> 04:56.470
of one of their DNA reports.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.123
You know,
with a little photoshopping,

04:58.167 --> 05:00.561
we could get this to say
whatever we want

05:00.604 --> 05:02.127
about where Ed comes from.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.390
Why would we do that?

05:03.433 --> 05:06.044
Well, it'd be fun
to see Ed find out

05:06.088 --> 05:08.743
he isn't as Basque
as he thinks he is.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.704
MIKE:
This is great.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.706
Broncos on TV, you and I

05:15.750 --> 05:18.318
drinking, cursing,
no women around.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.062
Want me to pull your finger
for old times' sake?

05:25.847 --> 05:28.415
Only if we're trailing
in the fourth quarter.

05:28.458 --> 05:32.593
Ah, it's always so nice to see
you guys having fun together.

05:32.636 --> 05:33.811
We're not having fun.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.465
Sitting here
on this couch together

05:35.509 --> 05:37.249
guarantees a Broncos victory.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.382
Well, I thought it'd be nice
if you asked Jen

05:39.426 --> 05:41.428
to watch the game with you.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.299
I was, I was just about to.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.520
Are you sure?
I don't really know much

05:46.563 --> 05:47.782
about American football.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.436
Well, that's just
about to change.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.741
Uh, sit down.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.048
Careful where you sit.
He's superstitious.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.963
I'm not that superstitious.
Sit down.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.400
-Okay.
-Uh, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.

05:59.707 --> 06:03.058
All right, well, I am off to
teach osmosis to a fifth grader.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.581
I just hope he absorbs it.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.670
Ah! That wasn't a bad pun.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.019
That was pretty funny, actually.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.760
Uh, no. No, that wasn't a pun.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.372
He's not smart.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.071
Okay, still first quarter.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
We're playing the Chargers.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.117
White helmet
with the little lightning bolt.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.684
We don't like them.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.034
All right, you got any
questions, just fire 'em out.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.645
Let's watch a little, huh?

06:24.688 --> 06:26.342
Why do they wear
their face masks?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.518
Is that so
they don't bite each other?

06:28.562 --> 06:30.433
I...

06:30.477 --> 06:33.262
I-I don't know.

06:33.305 --> 06:36.700
They use their hands much more
than they use their feet.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.485
Why isn't it called handball?

06:38.528 --> 06:42.271
Uh, I-I don't know.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.622
Punt.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.450
Okay, go, go, go, go.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.712
[grunts softly]

06:48.756 --> 06:50.758
-Fair catch.
-Fair catch.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.589
Mr. Baxter,
does it help your team

06:55.632 --> 06:58.069
when you wear their blouses?

07:01.290 --> 07:03.466
They're actually...
they're called jerseys.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.686
You know what?
We should just watch the game

07:05.729 --> 07:08.384
and then, ask the questions at
the end or something like that.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.473
Oh, there's a commercial.
I got a ball in the yard.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.866
-You want to go kick it around?
-No, no, no, no!

07:11.909 --> 07:13.737
-Yes!
-If you leave,

07:13.781 --> 07:15.130
you take the mojo with ya.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.393
Sorry, Dad.
Got to be a good host.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.134
Well, I hope we're not trailing
in the fourth quarter.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.571
I can't pull my own finger.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.752
Mike, can we talk?

07:28.796 --> 07:31.668
Or you still not over
your little disappointment?

07:31.712 --> 07:34.062
Listen, a little disappointment
would be the doctor saying,

07:34.105 --> 07:35.846
-"You're going
to have another girl."
-Oh.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.196
This is a big thing.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.111
The Broncos lost.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.939
So how is that my fault?

07:41.983 --> 07:44.159
Because you made Jen
watch the game with us.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.769
Then she and Eve took off,

07:45.813 --> 07:47.728
went outside,
took the mojo with them.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.294
The Broncos end up
losing the game.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.732
-It's science.
-Oh.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.734
Well, I'm sorry.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.431
I just want you two
to get along.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.998
-Why is that so important?
-[sighs]

07:57.041 --> 07:59.217
Because, honey, Jen is gonna
be here for six months.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.437
I want her to feel
like this is her home,

08:01.481 --> 08:02.960
and-and not feel like

08:03.004 --> 08:05.136
she's got to tiptoe
around the master of the house.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.660
"Master of the house."

08:06.703 --> 08:08.749
How come we don't use that term
more often?

08:08.792 --> 08:11.534
Come on. This is supposed to be
a great experience for her.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.144
I'm not asking you
to be her best friend.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.407
-You just have to be nice.
-Go with me on this.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.758
How about if I'm absent?

08:17.801 --> 08:21.762
'Cause if you think about it,
that would be nice.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.981
You're going to find something
you two have in common,

08:24.025 --> 08:25.461
and you're gonna bond.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.115
I'm a middle-aged man
from Colorado.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.117
She's a teenager from Hong Kong.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.555
The only thing on
that Venn diagram are egg rolls.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.427
[scoffs] Well, keep-keep
trying things, okay?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.560
Why-why don't you take Jen
to Outdoor Man?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.170
It's everything you love
under one roof.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.346
Your solution to not getting
along with her at home

08:41.390 --> 08:42.826
is take her to work with me?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.964
He hasn't come out yet?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.444
You gave him that fake report,
like, two hours ago.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.142
Yeah. I don't know.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.710
I still don't know if we should
be messing with a person's DNA.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.060
You know, we're not scientists.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.584
It's just a joke, Kyle.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.151
It still says he's Basque.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.502
I just added a little French,
a little Russian...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.983
and a whole lot of black.

09:09.026 --> 09:12.508
[both laugh quietly]

09:12.552 --> 09:15.729
ED:
Chuck! Chuck, get in here!

09:15.772 --> 09:17.644
Wait. Did he sound mad to you?

09:17.687 --> 09:21.735
Really mad, but the Russians are
a hot-tempered people.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.522
Hey, Ed.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.308
My brother!

09:30.352 --> 09:34.225
Oh. Uh, what's happening?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.792
I have great, great news.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.142
I want to share it
with one of my people.

09:39.796 --> 09:43.844
Chuck, I'm black.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.498
Wow. Ed, that DNA report...

09:46.542 --> 09:48.065
Has changed my life.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.763
Look at this.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.678
I'm 37 and a half percent
West African.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.636
-Uh-huh.
-All right?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.899
-My people were traced
to what is now Nigeria.
-Ah.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.293
Uh, uh, where are
your people from, Chuck?

09:58.336 --> 10:02.340
St. Louis. Ed,

10:02.384 --> 10:05.996
don't you find it a little hard
to believe that you're black?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.782
No, no,
th-this answers everything. No.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.785
See, my-my father always seemed
like he was keeping a secret,

10:11.828 --> 10:15.527
but now that I know what it was,
I finally feel close to him.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.878
This... this is a blessing.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.444
Oh, God.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.273
Hey, Kyle? Kyle?

10:22.317 --> 10:24.449
Kyle, would you...?
Uh, oh! Okay.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.277
-Just stay close, Kyle. Come on.
-Yes, sir.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.714
Ed just found out he's black,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.629
and his whole childhood
suddenly makes sense.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.676
-Mr. Alzate's black?
-Yeah.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.374
That doesn't seem possible.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.333
For too long
the white man has tried

10:38.376 --> 10:39.900
to tell us what's possible.
Right, Chuck?

10:39.943 --> 10:41.945
Yeah, man.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.643
It's really held you back.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.255
Listen, I-I-I got
to get back to work.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.909
No, no, no, no, just-just...
[chuckles]

10:48.952 --> 10:50.911
You're sticking close to me.
No, no.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.914
You have to enlighten me
on everything about our culture.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.394
-Our culture?
-Yeah, sit down. How we eat.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.832
-Oh.
-How we dance, how we love.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.749
Uh, I am not showing you
how we love, Ed.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.751
We'll start with our history,
all right?

11:04.794 --> 11:07.754
Kyle, go find us
a copy of Roots.

11:07.797 --> 11:08.972
Roots.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.061
That's nine and a half hours!

11:11.105 --> 11:14.195
Oh, we've been through worse,
my brother!

11:17.415 --> 11:19.940
We got hunting, fishing,
rock climbing over here.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.159
It's ski season now,
so got ski masks.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.205
Very popular
with the bank robbers.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.163
Oh, dear.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.599
I'm kidding.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.862
It's a joke.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.994
But you do have a lot
of crime in America, right?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.388
We're number one.

11:33.431 --> 11:36.304
Um... hey, hey, like boats?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.871
We'll go see the boats.
They're, uh, beautiful.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.960
It's a whole area, um--

11:40.003 --> 11:41.396
What am I saying?
You're from Hong Kong.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.745
You're a huge seaport.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.791
You're, like, lousy with boats.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.794
Yes, but I still get excited
seeing new ones.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.796
I think you're just being polite
with me.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.798
No, not at all.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.452
That would be
the polite thing to say.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.324
Uh, let's take a different tack.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.195
What are your interests?
We have a huge store.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.980
There's got to be something
in here that'd be cool for you.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.329
I really like origami.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.157
We don't have that.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.116
Oh, hey, Kris,
come here a minute.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.031
-Hi.
-Jen, I'd like you
to meet Kristin,

12:08.075 --> 12:08.771
my eldest daughter.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.338
She runs the restaurant here.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.992
Jen, finally.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.211
Mom won't stop talking
about you.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.909
I mean,
she loves talking in general,

12:15.952 --> 12:18.650
but she really lovestalking
about you.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.044
[chuckles] How, uh,
how's my old room treating you?

12:21.088 --> 12:23.133
Oh, that's your room?
It's awesome.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.918
Good, good.
Later, I'll, uh, show you

12:24.961 --> 12:27.398
the best way to...
[quietly]: sneak out the window.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.835
-[chuckling]
-After that,

12:28.878 --> 12:31.054
you can introduce her
to your son Boyd,

12:31.098 --> 12:34.057
the result
of sneaking out the window.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.711
He's kidding. It...

12:35.755 --> 12:37.713
It's funny 'cause it's true.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.975
[chuckles]

12:39.019 --> 12:41.673
It is so cool
you manage this place.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.458
My auntie runs a noodle shop
in Hong Kong.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.851
I practically grew up there.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.504
Oh, well,
the lunch rush is almost over.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.723
Do you want to tour the kitchen?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.507
Yes, that would be awesome.

12:49.551 --> 12:52.075
Mr. Baxter, may I please
be excused to join Kristin?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.861
Sure, I think you and I
have had enough fun.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.167
Oh, that was another joke.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.952
[forced laugh]

12:58.995 --> 13:02.477
Uh, do you want something
to eat first?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.871
We have coconut shrimp
in the buffet.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.437
-I love coconut shrimp.
-[chuckles]

13:06.481 --> 13:07.961
-[squeals]
-[laughs]

13:08.004 --> 13:10.746
-I hate coconut shrimp.
-Oh,

13:10.790 --> 13:11.834
I know that look.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.053
It's the same one you had

13:13.096 --> 13:15.272
when Mom told you to try
and bond with Ryan.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.883
This is unbelievable.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.102
She gets along
with every human she runs into.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.539
But she can't get over
being polite to me.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.541
Well, you just have to find
something to do with her

13:23.585 --> 13:25.108
that makes her so comfortable

13:25.152 --> 13:28.242
she forgets that you
make her uncomfortable.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.070
What time do you want her back?

13:30.113 --> 13:32.072
I'm thinking, um...

13:32.115 --> 13:33.334
June.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.910
And then you fold that corner
to there

13:43.953 --> 13:46.129
and that triangle to there

13:46.173 --> 13:47.478
and...

13:47.522 --> 13:48.697
origami.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.307
Boop.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.877
More like bore-igami.

13:54.921 --> 13:58.054
I can't believe they killed
a tree for this stuff.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.013
Hey, you want
to learn origami or not?

14:00.056 --> 14:03.538
Oh, God, no, I do not want to.
I'm doing this for your mom.

14:03.581 --> 14:06.323
I'm just doing this so that Jen
will feel more at home here.

14:06.367 --> 14:10.153
It'd be easier
to get rid of your mom.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.026
-Ah.
-What?

14:13.069 --> 14:14.810
I just think it's funny that
you think sharing an interest

14:14.854 --> 14:16.551
with her is the key
to getting along.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.248
I feel at home here,

14:18.292 --> 14:20.250
and you're not interested
in anything I care about.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.253
I care about a lot of stuff
you're interested in.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.994
Why didn't you come
to my first beauty pageant?

14:28.432 --> 14:31.392
You-you were
in a beauty pageant?

14:31.435 --> 14:33.089
Yeah, second place.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.962
Completely rigged.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.746
Look, it doesn't matter
if you're interested.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.095
We love hanging out
with each other.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.096
That's 'cause I'm your dad,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.143
and, by law,
I'm required to do that.

14:43.186 --> 14:46.755
And I have grown to appreciate
your hurtful sense of humor.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.974
Because I think you know
that mockery

14:48.017 --> 14:51.629
is the sincerest form
of flattery.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.631
No.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.983
You're just not comfortable when
you have to be nice to people.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.723
Maybe that's your problem
with Jen.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.726
I think you might
have just nailed it.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.728
Thank you.

15:03.772 --> 15:07.036
Hey, wait, is that more
of your hurtful humor?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.433
ED:
Okay, now,

15:12.476 --> 15:14.652
-so, we've covered soul food.
-Uh-huh.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.350
-And soul music, right?
-Mm.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.787
All right. Okay.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.789
Tell me about this-this
Soul Train.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.009
[sighs]

15:23.052 --> 15:25.533
Okay, y-you don't need
to know all this stuff, Ed.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.057
There's not going to be a test.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.406
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.973
Please, explain something.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.757
Explain Arsenio.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.629
-[groans]
-See, I-I just--

15:34.672 --> 15:36.152
-I-I never got him.
-Okay.

15:36.196 --> 15:39.242
All right,
I can't do this anymore.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.810
I faked the DNA results.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.552
This whole thing
was supposed to be a joke.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.119
-Excuse me?
-[scoffs]

15:46.162 --> 15:47.642
You were driving us crazy

15:47.685 --> 15:50.558
with your constant bragging
about being Basque,

15:50.601 --> 15:54.649
and I-I just wanted
to have a little fun.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.868
A little fun?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.654
With a man's ancestry?

15:59.697 --> 16:02.657
With my unresolved
father issues?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.267
I-In my defense,

16:04.311 --> 16:06.226
I thought
you'd see right through it.

16:06.269 --> 16:10.795
You know, my uncle got his ear
chewed off by a billy goat.

16:10.839 --> 16:14.234
Maybe there's a laugh
in that! Huh?

16:14.277 --> 16:15.191
-I'm...
-[knocking]

16:15.235 --> 16:16.932
Hey.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.282
Hey, guys.
Uh, I'm headed home.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.023
I just wanted to see
how everybody's doing.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
The world's turned
upside down, Kyle.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.766
Turns out I'm not black.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.378
I am shocked...

16:28.422 --> 16:31.033
that somebody would mess
with your DNA.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.556
We're not scientists.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.124
You knew.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.038
[sighs]

16:36.082 --> 16:38.475
Look, I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Alzate.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.042
I wanted to tell you,
but you kept saying

16:40.086 --> 16:42.131
you were done listening
to the Man.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.265
I'm sorry, too, Ed.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.918
And if it makes you feel
any better,

16:46.962 --> 16:49.834
it's not easy being
a black man in Denver.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.185
Or anywhere.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.664
Well, then I guess...

16:53.708 --> 16:55.536
I'm back to being Basque.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.538
Hey, being Basque is great, sir.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.540
-Yeah.
-The-the history,
the traditions,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.063
the soup.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
Well, that's-that's true, yeah.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.285
There's one more good thing
about being Basque.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.634
-CHUCK: Mm.
-Yes. [clears throat]

17:06.677 --> 17:08.201
We can't be fooled.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.116
Uh-oh...

17:10.159 --> 17:11.682
Yeah. Turns out,

17:11.726 --> 17:14.207
Beverly gave me
the real test results

17:14.250 --> 17:16.252
before you "found" my report.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.253
Yeah.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.255
I'm 82% Basque.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.518
And 100% too smart
for you idiots.

17:21.562 --> 17:22.563
[Chuck laughs]

17:26.132 --> 17:30.919
You made me watch
Madea Goes to Jail!

17:30.962 --> 17:32.529
[laughing]

17:32.573 --> 17:34.705
Not cool.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.577
[all laugh]

17:38.579 --> 17:40.189
That's a good one, Ed.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.756
Come on, Kyle.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.497
Kyle, Kyle.
[laughs]: Just a minute.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.239
There's just one more thing
I-I found in that report.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.197
[chuckles]
I'm seven percent Norwegian.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.546
Hey, I'm Norwegian.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.895
Yes, I know, I know.
[chuckles]

17:50.939 --> 17:52.332
Come sit down,
my little brother.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.118
All right, now,

17:56.162 --> 18:00.166
Chuck, uh, Chuck,
go find us a copy of Frozen.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.041
Oh, there you are.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.044
Oh, yes,
but I-I don't have to be.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.177
No, no, no, you're-you're fine
where you are.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.745
Listen, um, do me a favor
and cut the TV off, okay?

18:14.789 --> 18:16.051
Thanks.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.574
Listen, um...

18:17.618 --> 18:19.272
do you think I'm a nice guy?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.361
Of course, Mr. Baxter.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.363
I'm not.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.799
I'm really...

18:24.842 --> 18:26.931
sometimes quite a jerk.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.020
I don't know
how to respond to that.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.371
I'm looking for things
that we have in common

18:31.414 --> 18:33.764
so that we're comfortable
around each other.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.157
Well, that doesn't seem right.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.811
My father and I get along great,

18:36.854 --> 18:38.595
and we don't have anything
in common.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.990
Except that we both think
I'm adorable.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.209
[chuckles]
That's the kind of stuff you...

18:43.252 --> 18:45.298
you shouldn't actually say
out loud.

18:45.341 --> 18:48.170
So I think you should say
more stuff like that.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.780
But wouldn't that be rude?

18:49.824 --> 18:51.434
[sighs]

18:51.478 --> 18:53.219
Would you rather be polite
and uncomfortable

18:53.262 --> 18:55.612
or rude and comfortable?

18:55.656 --> 18:57.571
Can't you be polite
and comfortable?

18:57.614 --> 19:00.095
Eh...

19:00.139 --> 19:03.359
Being polite so often
requires you to just care

19:03.403 --> 19:05.361
about what other people are
doing and what they're feeling.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.321
Being comfortable, sometimes...

19:08.364 --> 19:10.018
you just do what you want

19:10.061 --> 19:12.412
and other people
just deal with it.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.630
[chuckles]

19:13.674 --> 19:15.197
-I think I get it.
-Yeah?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
So, if I wanted
to be comfortable,

19:17.243 --> 19:19.201
I would say...

19:19.245 --> 19:20.637
football sucks, soccer rules,

19:20.681 --> 19:23.423
and I do all my shopping online.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.207
Sure.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.209
Origami's boring,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.559
and playing football
with your feet is stupid.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.040
[scoffs]

19:32.083 --> 19:36.087
And tea is for old women.

19:36.131 --> 19:39.090
So, from now on,
I should just act the way I want

19:39.134 --> 19:40.614
and not worry
about being polite?

19:40.657 --> 19:43.356
Yeah. Do whatever you want to do
until I say don't.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.184
That's the way
it works around here.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.623
[speaking Chinese]

19:49.666 --> 19:52.582
It's a little fast.
I didn't catch the last of that.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.802
Something my father says.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.326
Roughly translated,
"I pay for that cell phone

19:57.370 --> 20:01.069
and the clothes on your back,
so watch it, Miss Thing."

20:01.112 --> 20:03.332
God, I like your dad
a lot already.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.292
So, just let me see
the remote here.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.903
-I was watching a movie.
-Don't care.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.384
That's not fair.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.516
You have a whole nother room
you can watch TV in.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.083
Eh, still,

20:15.126 --> 20:16.606
don't care.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.129
Ugh!

20:18.173 --> 20:20.131
I feel like I'm at home.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.132
There we go.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.352
[speaks Chinese]

20:36.539 --> 20:37.497
Hey. Morning.

20:37.540 --> 20:38.585
Morning.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.371
It's coffee.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.550
As it should be.

20:54.818 --> 20:57.386
[clears throat]

21:05.699 --> 21:08.267
[clears throat]
No.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.925
[sighs]

21:16.013 --> 21:18.320
[scoffs]
Did you read this thing about...

21:18.364 --> 21:20.017
[clears throat]

21:22.237 --> 21:23.891
Good morning, you two!

21:23.934 --> 21:25.284
[both clear throats]

21:26.807 --> 21:30.027
Huh. I knew
they'd find something in common.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.560
[chicken clucks]

21:40.603 --> 21:42.518
