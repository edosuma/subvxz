WEBVTT

00:27.636 --> 00:29.420
Bellissimo!

00:29.551 --> 00:31.466
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.555
Hey, Jim.Jim, good to see you.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.339
Good to see you.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.211
Hey, Mr. Bonnano,
Mr. Colombo!

00:43.173 --> 00:44.261
What are you doing?What?

00:44.392 --> 00:45.871
Leave the fucking cannoli.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.177
You're a capo

00:47.308 --> 00:49.092
when you really need
to be a boss.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.182
We gotta get you
your own seat at the table.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.532
It's the only way
we're gonna make change.

00:54.663 --> 00:58.275
Lucchese, Gambino,
those tired fucks,

00:58.406 --> 01:00.364
one of them gotta go.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.804
And you want me
to take care of it?

01:05.935 --> 01:07.197
When the time is right.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.243
With you and me in power,
we can do things

01:09.373 --> 01:11.245
the way they
should be fuckin' done.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.467
- Mr. Colombo.- Whoa.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.208
Come in, Dominic.Yeah.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.297
Come on, let him in.Excuse me, excuse me.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.343
Sorry to interrupt.
I saw you walk by,

01:22.473 --> 01:23.474
and, uh, I brought these...You don't have to do this.

01:24.649 --> 01:24.693
Look at this.For you and your friends.

01:25.346 --> 01:25.607
That's beautiful.

01:26.738 --> 01:26.782
Francesca and I
are so grateful.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.305
Good, good, good.

01:28.436 --> 01:29.350
I'm in a meeting right now.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.091
Oh, I'm sorry.No, no, no.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.353
God bless you, sir.No, I'll see you in a bit.

01:32.483 --> 01:33.615
God bless you, Mr. Colombo.Yeah, yeah.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.618
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.318
The fuck is that?Oh, he owes.

01:41.449 --> 01:44.191
He, uh--he owns the bakery
over on Grand.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.757
His grandkid's sick,

01:45.888 --> 01:48.108
so I suspended
the interest for six months.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.372
You wanna be a boss,

01:51.502 --> 01:53.113
you better
start acting like one.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.375
You're going soft on me?

01:55.767 --> 01:56.028
It sends a wrong message
showing mercy like that.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.161
No, no, no, I told him if he
doesn't pay me in six months,

01:59.031 --> 01:59.728
I'll kill his whole family.

02:01.033 --> 02:01.904
I'll gut the kid first
and make the family watch.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.167
That's what
I'm talking about.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.604
That's the change we need.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.825
I still don't know
about the seat though.

02:09.955 --> 02:12.044
There's gotta be another way.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.178
Ain't exactly
handing 'em out, Joey.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.050
You want that seat?

02:18.181 --> 02:19.443
You gotta take it.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.674
Top of the morning, Bobby.Good morning, Mr. Evans.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.980
Morning, Mr. Evans.Hey, babies.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.944
Julie, baby, welcome back.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.996
Good morning, Mr. Evans.Good morning.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.042
Hey.Hey, Bob.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.783
Those rushes
looked great last night.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.351
You're doing such a good job.
You keep it up.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.178
Watch that budget, though.Evans!

04:26.309 --> 04:27.528
Johnny Potatoes!Whoo!

04:27.658 --> 04:29.181
You're looking good, man.You like that, huh?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.531
I just came down to tell you.

04:31.967 --> 04:32.402
Hank can't fucking direct
his way out of a paper bag.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.361
But you, star,

04:34.491 --> 04:35.797
you're knocking it
out of the park.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.207
Good morning, Bob.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.253
Well, it should be,
and it would be, Peter,

04:57.384 --> 04:58.472
if I didn't have to watch
the rushes

04:58.602 --> 05:00.300
for "Tarzan and the Jungle Boy"
last night.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.302
My God, what a turd.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.913
But the sun is shining.
It's still a good day.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.262
What do we got?
Hit me.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.698
Bluhdorn is having trouble
wrapping his head

05:07.829 --> 05:09.613
around Eastwood
starring in a musical.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.050
He wants to talk.Neil Simon called.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.530
He says it's gotta be Lemmon,

05:13.661 --> 05:15.140
but Lemmon will only do it
if Matthau's in it,

05:15.271 --> 05:17.969
and he wants 300,000
for the picture,

05:18.100 --> 05:20.276
and Bluhdorn says quote,
"Under no circumstances

05:20.407 --> 05:24.411
are we paying anyone $300,000
to star in anything." Unquote.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.414
He said a few other things.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.067
Don't be scared.
What did he say?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.593
He said he's got a fire poker
with your name on it,

05:32.723 --> 05:34.029
if you need
a better illustration

05:34.159 --> 05:35.900
of the studio's finances.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.598
Huh.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.991
All right, take a deep breath.
This is what you're gonna do.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.950
Peter, you're gonna send
a copy of Clint's album

05:42.080 --> 05:44.082
"Cowboy Favorites" to Bluhdorn.
That's gonna change his tune.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.999
Now, Sheila, you can tell him--
you tell Charlie Bluhdorn

05:48.130 --> 05:50.045
that he can save his poker
for opening night

05:50.175 --> 05:51.699
because if that film
is anything like the play,

05:51.829 --> 05:54.354
"The Odd Couple"
it's gonna save this studio,

05:54.484 --> 05:56.834
and I'll bend over for him
if it doesn't.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.662
Thank you, Sheila.
Peter, you stay.

06:21.816 --> 06:25.385
Hey, Ruddy,
I'm not paying you to read.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.388
Those contracts need to be on
my desk by the end of the day.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.954
They were on your desk
this morning.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.523
Good.

06:35.873 --> 06:39.181
Ruddy, you're making
the rest of us look bad.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.356
Dave, you're doing
a great job of that

06:40.487 --> 06:41.923
all on your own, buddy.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.945
Uh, nice car, sir.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.426
You'd be surprised
what a paint job will do.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.079
Or a blow torch.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.430
Hey, Ruddy!

07:10.560 --> 07:12.170
Mitch,
sorry I'm late, buddy.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.171
Had a hard time
finding the place.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.434
After a year in L.A.,

07:14.564 --> 07:15.826
who doesn't know
where the Chateau is?

07:15.957 --> 07:17.175
Just try not to impress
too many girls

07:17.306 --> 07:19.264
with that shirt tonight, Ruddy.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.310
What?
I came straight from work.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.659
Still lost on me what you do.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.661
It's contracts or something,
right?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.271
I've told you 13 times.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.448
You really think this
is gonna be the time it sticks?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.972
That's a good point.
Let's grab a drink.

07:31.102 --> 07:34.018
and All Of The Night"]

07:36.325 --> 07:38.022
Wendy.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.302
I was wondering where the
beautiful, cool cats had gone.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.175
Here they all are.
How's it going?

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
Darling.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.961
Yeah, Bob, nice to see you.Nice to see you.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.835
Hey, who is that guy?

08:07.965 --> 08:10.490
Bob Evans, head of Paramount.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.709
Guy's more connected than God,

08:12.840 --> 08:15.886
and yeah, he's always that tan.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.367
Nikita, you don't want
to miss this bus, baby.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.803
Let's do it.
Come on.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.637
Everyone, this is
my neighbor, Al Ruddy.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.118
How are you?Hey.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.295
Any friend of Mitch's
is a friend of mine.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.862
Okay.

08:39.301 --> 08:42.609
You sure
you're just a TV writer?

08:42.739 --> 08:44.524
I'm in the wrong
fucking business.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.835
What am I doing wrong?
Nobody came.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.664
Mario, this is the best thing
you've written.

08:54.795 --> 08:58.668
Six years wasted.

09:00.148 --> 09:03.064
"The Fortunate Pilgrim"
was my mother's story.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.762
Uh, you know, I...

09:05.893 --> 09:07.938
I thought the world
would identify with it.

09:08.069 --> 09:12.769
Three people came
and--and no one bought a book.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.858
I don't even know
what to write anymore.

09:14.989 --> 09:18.558
People perked up listening to
the part about the mafia guy.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.211
Oh, yeah, great.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.387
That was, like,
three paragraphs.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.693
Well, did you
ever think about

09:23.824 --> 09:26.087
writing a mafia book
with more than that?

09:26.217 --> 09:31.222
I spent my childhood
hiding from those gangsters.

09:31.353 --> 09:35.400
I--I--you know, Hell's Kitchen
was chock full of 'em.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.141
So write what you know.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.493
So they can
put a bullet in my head?

09:41.624 --> 09:43.452
Just think about it.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.280
21 Club, please.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.381
Anthony.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.298
Yeah.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.781
You know, you owe our friend
a thousand dollars.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.218
Yeah, uh, uh, you know,

10:10.348 --> 10:14.048
I--I have, uh, 40.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.398
Take that.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.103
Oh.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.452
How much do we owe?

10:29.367 --> 10:30.934
You don't wanna know.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.372
I thought this book
was the one.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.811
We'd be able
to pay 'em back and...

10:41.902 --> 10:45.035
So what are gonna do, Mario?

10:45.166 --> 10:49.910
Candida wants me
to write about the mafia.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.826
I married you because
you're an artist, not a hack.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.741
Hacks sell books.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.439
They can pay for the education
of their kids.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.788
Hacks don't borrow money
from guys

10:58.919 --> 11:00.442
you shouldn't
borrow money from.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.880
How much do we owe?

11:11.105 --> 11:14.674
Five Gs to two bookies.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.806
A few grand to the bank,

11:16.937 --> 11:19.679
not including
what I owe my brother.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.207
Fuck art, Mario.
Start typing.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.384
You want me to write
about the mafia?

11:29.514 --> 11:30.951
Yeah.

11:31.081 --> 11:34.694
How do I tell that story
any differently?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.826
Everybody knows they steal.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.873
They control gambling,
they run whores, unions.

11:40.003 --> 11:43.354
Okay, so maybe it's not
just a book about the mafia.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.704
What do you mean?

11:44.834 --> 11:46.923
Well, the guys
you grew up with,

11:47.054 --> 11:48.838
they didn't start out
so different from you.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.711
Immigrants.
They eat, they drink,

11:51.841 --> 11:53.887
they love, they cry,

11:54.017 --> 11:55.671
they worry about
their kids' futures

11:55.802 --> 11:57.281
just like us.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.850
And they kill.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.811
Okay,
so maybe we don't kill.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.032
But maybe this book

12:09.163 --> 12:11.382
is about
finding the reason we would.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.696
More Than Anything"]

12:21.871 --> 12:23.481
Have a beautiful night.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.787
Hey.Hey.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.615
Hi.Hi, guys.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.052
How are you?
Nice. Enjoying?

12:30.184 --> 12:32.795
I'm back. I'm back.
Whatever he said, he's lying.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.932
- How we doing?- I'm good.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.847
Okay, so now
you look interesting.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.284
Are you interesting?Depends on the company.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.068
Hmm, that's a good answer.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.896
Who's your friend, Mitch?

12:47.027 --> 12:51.422
Françoise Glazer,
this is my neighbor, Al Ruddy.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.773
Mm.
What do you do?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.557
Programming.Programming.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.167
What network?

12:57.298 --> 12:59.822
I program computers
for the Rand Corporation.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.476
Still have no idea
what that means.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.783
The Rand Corporation?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.306
I'm impressed.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.829
That's defense work.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.875
Secret.
It's not top secret.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.791
What about you, what do you do?

13:11.921 --> 13:14.402
She owns the ground
you're sitting on, my friend.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.534
The hotel?

13:16.665 --> 13:18.406
You're surprised?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.190
You think a woman
can't run a business?

13:20.321 --> 13:21.888
I was raised
by a single mother.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.541
She could've run anything.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.674
You see?
He doesn't hate his mother

13:25.805 --> 13:27.197
like all you comedy writers.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.764
Come on.Come on.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.505
Oh, you write comedy too?Uh, no.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.160
You watch "Sgt. Bilko"?Yeah, I love "Bilko."

13:33.290 --> 13:34.422
I play Gomez.

13:34.552 --> 13:35.989
You know, I thought
you looked familiar.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.251
I'm a hell of a comedy fan.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.122
The way these shows
tell their stories,

13:39.253 --> 13:41.081
it's like a formula,
and in a good way.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.648
A formula?Think about it.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.347
"Bilko," "McHale's Navy,"
even "My Favorite Martian,"

13:46.477 --> 13:47.914
right, they're
the same cast of characters

13:48.044 --> 13:49.263
in similar situations

13:49.393 --> 13:51.526
with just enough difference
to be interesting.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.919
That's kind of true, Mitch.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.269
If you really wanna upset
the apple cart,

13:55.399 --> 13:57.314
put your cast of characters
where you least expect them

13:57.445 --> 14:00.100
to be in a comedy,
somewhere that isn't safe.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.276
That's how you
make it stand out.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.755
If it were really that easy,

14:03.886 --> 14:05.932
every Tom, Dick, and Ruddy
would do it.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.542
I didn't mean any offense.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.804
Hey, uh, you seem to have

14:08.935 --> 14:10.110
a hell of an instinct
for all these shows.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.025
I mean, you wanna
talk shop sometime?

14:12.155 --> 14:13.243
I could send you some scripts.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.723
You could see
how they all lay out.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.159
That'd be great.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.683
But, hey, I'm just a guy
who programs computers.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.121
All evidence to the contrary.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.707
You found it.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.886
Oh, boy.Mm-hmm.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.978
It's not about a gang.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.936
It's about a gangster's family.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.895
Oh.Hmm?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.071
The oldest son is a hothead.

14:58.201 --> 15:02.902
The middle son is sweet,
but he's weak,

15:03.032 --> 15:06.253
and the younger son
is a war hero

15:06.383 --> 15:08.908
who wants nothing to do
with the family business.

15:09.038 --> 15:09.996
Okay.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.867
But the Don wants this son,

15:11.998 --> 15:12.912
call him Michael...

15:13.042 --> 15:14.435
Mm-hmm.Hmm?

15:14.565 --> 15:17.742
Wants him to rise above
the family business

15:17.873 --> 15:21.181
and become a--a senator,
you know, someone powerful,

15:21.311 --> 15:25.794
but Michael's destiny
won't let him escape

15:25.925 --> 15:30.538
the power of Don Vito Corleone.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.669
Who's the Don?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.149
He's what Sicilians call

15:33.280 --> 15:35.238
the godfather of gangsters.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.283
Oh.Huh?

15:37.371 --> 15:38.372
He's, uh,
the head of the family.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.721
Oh.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.594
And my title.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.901
"The Godfather"?Mm-hmm.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.511
I like it.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.298
Okay.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.343
All right,
it's not written yet.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.569
"The Godfather." Hmm.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.275
So come on.
What do you wanna pitch?

16:12.406 --> 16:16.018
We could do rags to riches
or fish out of water.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.064
I mean, Bernie, I don't
even know what a pitch is.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.891
Don't even know
what a pitch is.

16:20.022 --> 16:20.980
Uh, we just
go into the network,

16:21.110 --> 16:22.459
tell 'em about our idea.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.157
You know, what it's about,
the characters,

16:24.287 --> 16:25.723
what stories
we tell week to week.

16:25.854 --> 16:26.942
That's it.
That's the pitch.

16:28.204 --> 16:28.683
Look, all these execs
want to see is that

16:29.858 --> 16:31.077
they can put
a hundred episodes in the can.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.426
Okay, so maybe we go with

16:32.556 --> 16:34.515
what you've hit with,
a military comedy.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.256
Eh, there's already
"McHale's Navy,"

16:36.386 --> 16:37.909
"F Troop," "Gomer Pyle."

16:38.040 --> 16:39.259
They're gonna wanna
see something new.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.261
"McHale" and "Gomer's"
are peacetime stories.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.133
Nobody's set a military comedy
during wartime.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.222
Let's do something
about what you know, hmm?

16:46.353 --> 16:48.572
Workplace comedy set
at a defense contractor.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.879
It's not inherently funny.
Trust me, I live it.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.402
Not to you.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.406
Hey, you ever seen
"Stalag 17"

16:56.537 --> 16:58.278
with William Holden?Mm-hmm.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.628
American POWs.
It's a Billy Wilder thing.

17:00.758 --> 17:01.542
It's great characters, man.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.457
I mean,
it's set up for a comedy.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.111
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.419
No, war equals death.
Hey, let's do this.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.161
Let's sell the Rand comedy,
and after that,

17:12.292 --> 17:14.381
we can sell
the army comedy, hmm?

17:19.995 --> 17:21.823
Ruddy, just relax, okay?
You're making me nervous.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.391
Yeah, well, we fuck this up,
you go back to making TV.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.263
I go back to Rand
where the soul goes to die.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.179
Goodbye, Miss Taylor.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.094
Holy shit.
That's Elizabeth Taylor.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.668
Gentleman,
Mr. Paley will see you now.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.585
And so these two bachelors

17:44.715 --> 17:45.977
at the Rand Corporation,

17:46.108 --> 17:47.631
they're actually peaceniks.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.851
They're using company computers
to program for peace

17:49.981 --> 17:50.982
instead of war.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.723
There's a lot of
good stuff in here.

17:52.854 --> 17:53.855
People are gonna love it.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.249
We call it "Modern Warfare."

17:56.379 --> 17:58.816
Mm, interesting idea.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.602
You got anything else?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.610
"Bilko," swastikas.
Swastikas, "Bilko."

18:10.350 --> 18:12.482
You think Nazis are funny?

18:13.483 --> 18:15.355
Imagine Bilko
as a pilot, right?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.008
He's a colonel,
and he's fighting in the war.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.273
He gets shot down over Germany
and taken prisoner.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.665
Mr. Ruddy,
I don't think this is--

18:21.796 --> 18:23.232
Now, our colonel, he knows
exactly how to escape,

18:23.363 --> 18:24.494
but he never does.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.148
None of the prisoners do
because he's leading

18:26.279 --> 18:28.498
an allied group inside the camp
to help the resistance.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.675
The camp commandant,
he is a guy named Klink.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.024
Now, he's got a reputation

18:33.155 --> 18:34.417
of being the toughest guy
in the SS,

18:34.548 --> 18:36.115
but actually
he's a fucking idiot.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.857
Yeah, and there's
this big fat sergeant,

18:39.988 --> 18:41.294
uh, Sergeant Schultz.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.078
And he's always
walking in on their plans,

18:43.209 --> 18:44.645
but he likes the guys,
they're nice to him,

18:44.775 --> 18:45.559
so he turns a blind eye.

18:46.516 --> 18:46.821
I see nothing.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.171
I hear nothing.
I know nothing.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.130
There's a French prisoner.
Guy's a gourmet chef,

18:51.260 --> 18:52.174
and he feeds the guard dogs

18:52.305 --> 18:53.306
so that
they love the prisoners.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.350
Eh, this is for you,

18:54.481 --> 18:55.743
my little chienne.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.571
That's a good boy.
That's a good boy.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.705
Are there any women
in the show?

19:01.836 --> 19:04.882
Oh, yeah, there's a woman,
and not just any woman.

19:05.013 --> 19:09.365
Oh, boys, Helga,
she is an Amazon, right?

19:09.496 --> 19:12.238
I mean, sexy German secretary.

19:12.368 --> 19:16.546
"Oh, Guten Tag,
mein little Liebchen!"

19:16.677 --> 19:19.027
Hey, and she might even
have an eye for our colonel.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.898
Yeah, so she's in on
all their schemes.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.683
What do you call this thing?

19:22.813 --> 19:23.901
"Hogan's Heroes."

19:25.642 --> 19:27.035
Have you pitched this
anywhere else?

19:29.211 --> 19:30.778
Don't.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.519
'Cause we're buying it.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.617
"I'll make him
an offer he can't refuse."

19:43.747 --> 19:45.140
Great line.Yeah.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.621
It's fun, isn't it?It's special, Mario.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.145
The Frank Sinatra,
Johnny Fontane character?

19:50.276 --> 19:51.625
Great.

19:51.755 --> 19:55.237
Maybe Sinatra will play him
in the movie, hmm?

19:55.368 --> 19:56.673
Should we call Paramount?

19:56.804 --> 19:59.589
Mario, just because
they optioned it early,

19:59.720 --> 20:01.156
it doesn't mean
it's gonna get made.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.418
Yeah.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.204
Let's make sure
it gets published first.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.597
They say to me,
you can make "Love Story,"

20:07.728 --> 20:08.511
which we agree,

20:09.469 --> 20:09.730
greatest love story
of all time.

20:10.774 --> 20:14.038
But the girl
has to live at the end.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.649
Can you fucking believe that?

20:15.779 --> 20:17.520
Yeah, the death
is what makes it work.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.044
Yes.Look at "Romeo and Juliet."

20:20.175 --> 20:21.742
Not the same story
if they'd lived.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.222
God, no.

20:23.352 --> 20:26.312
We feel the pain of the loss,
feel the grief.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.315
We feel pity.
We--we cry.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.231
I'll make the movie, Bob,
but only if she dies.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.189
You are preaching
to the choir, babe.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.712
Look, you make "Love Story,"

20:35.843 --> 20:38.411
and I will give you
total creative control.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.630
And final cut.And a back end that's real.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.241
We got a chance
to make a huge hit here.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.331
I only make two decisions,
all right?

20:45.461 --> 20:47.463
Hiring you, yes.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.118
Secondly, casting Ali MacGraw.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.077
Bob, I don't know
if I'm comfortable

20:53.208 --> 20:54.601
with hiring your girlfriend.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.212
One of the best actresses
of our time.

20:57.343 --> 21:01.390
Trust me, my friend,
I've seen her up close.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.262
And so should you,
that's all I'm saying.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.699
Sheila, could you send in
our guest, please?

21:05.829 --> 21:06.830
What is this?

21:08.354 --> 21:12.793
Ali MacGraw,
meet Arthur Hiller.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.056
I'm so excited
to be working with you.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.318
Me too.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.147
You two are gonna
make magic together.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.149
I'll let you get acquainted.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.676
I saw your most recent film.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.287
I loved it.Thank you so much.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.985
Sheila,

21:31.115 --> 21:32.508
I'm good.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.903
"In The Still of the Night"]

21:36.033 --> 21:38.862
Lucchese and Gambino
got here about ten minutes ago.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.481
Sinatra's crying to everyone
but the Pope

21:48.611 --> 21:51.353
about this book
that's about to come out:

21:51.484 --> 21:52.920
"The Godfather."

21:53.703 --> 21:55.314
Giving me a fucking headache.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.532
'Cause there's
a character in it

21:56.663 --> 21:59.100
that's supposed to be
a real fighetta,

21:59.230 --> 22:00.406
and everyone thinks it's him.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.190
How'd you know that?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.974
I read it somewhere.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.633
I just have
to use the bathroom.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.335
What have we got here?

22:16.465 --> 22:18.424
He said it was important
to the commission.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.335
Sit down, Joe.
Have a drink.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.381
You're making me nervous
standing like that.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.994
Sit down, Joe.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.570
I've been offered a seat
at the commission table.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.660
My own family.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.403
Well, nobody told me
about that.

23:24.533 --> 23:25.752
Well, it's supposed to be

23:25.882 --> 23:27.580
the last thing
you'll ever hear.

23:32.323 --> 23:33.760
Bonanno.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.240
He came to me a while back,

23:36.371 --> 23:38.678
talking about making changes.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.941
That's what he thinks
I'm doing here right now.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.118
But I'm here to tell you
so you can deal with it

23:44.248 --> 23:45.859
the way the commission chooses.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.516
And then you take
Bonanno's seat at the table?

23:54.128 --> 23:56.565
Well, that's not up to me.
That's up to you.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.829
Hey, I'm an ambitious guy,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.528
but not at the price of
my loyalty to what we do here,

24:02.658 --> 24:04.530
to you and the rest
of the commission.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.185
I respect whatever you decide.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.145
Good night, gentlemen.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.280
Let's go.

24:16.411 --> 24:19.893
Bonanno, he's gotta go.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.256
You maniacs!

24:35.386 --> 24:37.301
You blew it up!

24:37.432 --> 24:39.260
God damn you!

24:40.653 --> 24:44.787
God damn you all to hell!

24:58.105 --> 24:59.933
Uh, are we moving in?

25:01.369 --> 25:02.631
This.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.678
This is what it's all about.

25:07.549 --> 25:08.942
What, monkeys?

25:09.072 --> 25:12.467
No, the excitement,
the thrill.

25:12.598 --> 25:13.686
I mean, did you
hear them at the end?

25:13.816 --> 25:16.689
Yes, uh, that--
that was a great ending.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.560
No, no,
it's not just about the ending,

25:18.691 --> 25:20.780
it's--it's about
the experience of it.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.434
You got 300 people
all watching the same thing,

25:23.565 --> 25:24.827
reacting in real time,

25:24.958 --> 25:26.916
just feeding off each other.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.181
You can't get that experience
in television.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.575
You're just
in your living room,

25:33.706 --> 25:35.229
looking at a small
fucking box.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.361
It's just a different game.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.667
Five years of "Hogan's"
and you can make

25:38.798 --> 25:40.364
all the money you'd ever need.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.540
Five years of "Hogan's,"

25:41.670 --> 25:43.585
I'm gonna shoot myself
in the face.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.544
Hmm.Yeah.

25:45.674 --> 25:46.545
They showed us
the writer's room

25:46.675 --> 25:48.198
at CBS last week.Mm.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.374
It was like an exact
fucking replica of Rand.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.292
It can't just be
about the money.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.991
At first, I thought it was,
this whole Hollywood thing,

25:58.121 --> 26:00.384
but...

26:00.515 --> 26:02.038
my mother,

26:02.169 --> 26:04.040
she was a tough broad,

26:04.171 --> 26:08.001
and she never showed emotion
ever about anything,

26:08.131 --> 26:10.525
except at the movies.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.832
That was the only time
I ever saw my mother cry.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.012
I mean, you can't put a price
on that experience.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.189
I mean, that's magic, baby.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.194
I need to be in the movies.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.946
So what do you know
about producing film?

26:40.076 --> 26:42.209
What do I know
about producing TV?

26:42.339 --> 26:43.297
Good point.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.604
Let's go.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.432
You coming?

26:57.006 --> 26:59.052
Sir.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.410
I'm having a party
Saturday night,

27:09.540 --> 27:10.846
and if you're not there,

27:10.977 --> 27:12.631
well, I'm just gonna send
everybody home,

27:12.761 --> 27:14.458
even Jack and Warren.

27:14.589 --> 27:15.764
Huh?

27:15.895 --> 27:17.679
Nicholson and Beatty.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.681
Ooh, you're gonna love them.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.684
And, uh, bathing suits
are optional.

27:22.815 --> 27:25.121
Barry, what are you doing here?

27:25.252 --> 27:26.862
I hate to interrupt
your little soiree,

27:26.993 --> 27:29.386
but we had a meeting.Oh, relax, Barry.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.562
Have a drink before you have
a heart attack, right, girls?

27:31.693 --> 27:32.912
It's00 in the morning.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.915
Coffee, black.Give us a minute.

27:36.045 --> 27:40.006
I'm sorry.
Every party needs a pooper.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.192
How you doing, Barry?Bob.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.107
Thank you.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.630
I got off the phone
with Charlie.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.023
He's livid.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.329
Paramount has fallen back
to eight out of nine.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.722
Let me guess.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.681
He's up your ass about
"Paint Your Wagon" overages.

28:02.811 --> 28:03.899
Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood

28:04.030 --> 28:05.509
should be shooting people,
not singing!

28:05.640 --> 28:06.685
That's entertainment.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.077
And what's
with the "Love Story"?

28:08.208 --> 28:10.776
The girl dies at the end?
Who wants to see that?

28:10.906 --> 28:12.038
It's his studio.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.431
Look, I'm not gonna beat
around the bush.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.172
We need hits.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.914
You can't live off of
"Rosemary's Baby" forever.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.178
Barry, did you--
did you read "Love Story"?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.659
Yes.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.530
Why?

28:26.661 --> 28:27.923
Did it move you?

28:28.054 --> 28:30.883
What does that have to do
with anything?

28:31.013 --> 28:32.058
The audience
needs to be moved, Barry.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.973
That's how you make
hit pictures.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.323
Times are changing,
and we need to keep up.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.281
That's why I got the job
in the ivory tower

28:38.412 --> 28:40.240
and you don't.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.590
If you don't string together
some hits,

28:42.721 --> 28:46.725
that ivory tower of yours
is going to come crashing down.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.471
Oh, ye of such little faith.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.778
Bottoms up, Barry.

29:08.442 --> 29:09.791
Bob Evans.
I'm Al Ruddy.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.706
I wanted to talk to you.
You got a minute?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.926
I'm fairly certain
we don't have a meeting,

29:14.056 --> 29:15.971
but you knew that already,
didn't you?

29:16.102 --> 29:17.494
How'd you get on the lot?

29:17.625 --> 29:20.497
Ain't exactly Fort Knox.Fair enough.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.847
What can I do for you,
Mr. Ruddy?

29:21.977 --> 29:23.892
It's what I can do for you.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.720
I wanna produce for Paramount.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.940
You told a good story once.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.464
Ballsy of you to walk away
from "Hogan's Heroes."

29:30.594 --> 29:32.945
So you do know who I am?I know who everyone is, kid.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.295
Look, you know what
a producer does, Mr. Ruddy?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.514
They do whatever it takes
to get their movie made.

29:37.645 --> 29:38.733
Now, what makes you think

29:38.864 --> 29:40.735
that you're qualified
to do that, huh?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.389
You know, I read
an article in "Variety,"

29:42.519 --> 29:44.217
said that you started out
selling ladies' slacks

29:44.347 --> 29:47.133
and doing bit parts in movies,
but you still figured it out.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.179
Don't--don't--
don't call them bit parts

29:50.310 --> 29:51.790
when you're kissing
someone's ass.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.704
I work with Jimmy fucking
Cagney, my friend,

29:53.835 --> 29:55.706
toe-to-toe.

29:55.837 --> 29:59.580
So unknown computer guy

29:59.710 --> 30:02.888
creates CBS's hit comedy
about Nazis.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.716
Go figure.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.936
All right.
All right.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.156
You do remind me of me,
and I'm a sentimental guy,

30:10.286 --> 30:11.810
and you caught me
on a good day.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.855
Let's set a lunch, Mr. Ruddy.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.858
Talk about your future.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.429
What producers
have you worked for?

30:22.559 --> 30:23.996
You'll be my first.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.867
I've worked in legal
for three years

30:25.998 --> 30:28.261
and then saw this job posted.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.872
Well, then, I guess, uh,
we both have a lot to learn.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.179
Thanks.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.749
Thank you.
We'll let you know.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.447
I thought
he just gave me the job.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.449
Oh, no, sweetie.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.799
That was just
his Valium talking.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.236
You are dodging a bullet here.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.282
You can thank me later.
Exit's that way.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.763
Thank you.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.113
All right, bye.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.205
You're Albert Ruddy.

30:59.901 --> 31:00.859
Who are you?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.643
Bettye McCartt.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.124
Bernie Fein sent me.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.519
Bernie.

31:09.650 --> 31:10.825
It's nice to meet you, Bettye,
but I'm sorry.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.653
I just hired somebody.

31:12.783 --> 31:13.959
That little mouse?Yeah.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.351
No.Yeah.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.223
No.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.532
Let me take you on a tour.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.013
Come on.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.102
I don't bite.

31:29.104 --> 31:33.195
That spot
is hallowed fucking ground.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.893
You're not even
paying attention to it.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.851
Look.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.200
The guard gate?

31:40.246 --> 31:42.596
That is where Gloria Swanson

31:42.726 --> 31:46.252
drove onto the lot
in "Sunset Boulevard."

31:47.427 --> 31:48.950
Because she thought
Cecil B. DeMille

31:49.081 --> 31:50.909
wanted to make
her version of "Salome."

31:51.039 --> 31:52.084
When all he actually wanted

31:52.214 --> 31:53.607
was her fucking car.Fucking car.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.610
Oh, you see that door?

31:56.740 --> 32:00.048
That is the secret entrance
where Adolph Zukor,

32:00.179 --> 32:02.094
who's the founder of Paramount,

32:02.224 --> 32:03.573
it's where he used to sneak
his little starlets

32:03.704 --> 32:05.488
into his office.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.273
Oh.Ooh.

32:08.970 --> 32:12.452
It's hallowed ground, man.
Hallowed ground.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.802
Ladies, it's time.
Come on, let's go.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.151
Seriously, what's your story?

32:16.282 --> 32:17.631
It's not
terribly interesting.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.763
Worked for Rand Corporation
before "Hogan's."

32:19.894 --> 32:21.765
Architect before that.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.071
Those are both steady gigs.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.855
Why'd you walk away?

32:24.986 --> 32:26.640
Because I could, I guess.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.646
So, Bettye, what's your story?

32:32.776 --> 32:34.169
It's not
terribly interesting.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.521
I'm divorced, opinionated.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.220
The latter most likely
the cause of the former.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.961
Okay,
let's get ready for picture.

32:43.091 --> 32:45.050
Walk it up.I love the movies.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.183
My mom used to take me
every Saturday.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.793
Even when she couldn't make
the rent.

32:49.924 --> 32:52.231
Single mother?Mm-hmm.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.668
Yeah, me too.

32:56.191 --> 32:57.801
Still go every Saturday?

32:57.932 --> 32:59.716
Yes, I do.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.109
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.897
How long is your
deal here for, Al?

33:07.028 --> 33:09.074
A year.What, really?

33:09.204 --> 33:11.380
That is not long enough
to start from scratch.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.165
We have to find a script
that's been overlooked.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.080
Places, everybody!
I want to feel some energy!

33:15.210 --> 33:17.299
Well, then
we'd better get started.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.431
Yeah?

33:20.041 --> 33:20.999
Let's watch this take first.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.609
Quiet on set!

33:24.089 --> 33:26.265
"The New York Times'"
Dick Schaap,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.832
"What Philip Roth
did for masturbation,

33:28.963 --> 33:30.312
Puzo does for murder."

33:30.443 --> 33:32.749
"The Post,"
"A searing portrayal

33:32.880 --> 33:34.795
of the mafia underworld."

33:36.927 --> 33:39.800
I'll lay odds that you're gonna
be signing more than 30 books.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.208
Bob, I found something
you're gonna love.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.645
Jesus, Ruddy!
Knock.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.038
It's all right, Sheila.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.517
What was the best scene
in "The Great Escape"?

34:01.648 --> 34:03.041
I don't have time
for party games.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.781
It's McQueen's
motorcycle jump.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.696
Yeah, true.
So what?

34:06.827 --> 34:09.525
I found a great script.
It's about motorcycle racers.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.180
And chicks?Yeah, and chicks.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.660
It's called
"Little Fauss and Big Halsy."

34:13.790 --> 34:15.270
It's perfect for McQueen.Oh, forget McQueen.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.794
For Christ's sake, he's making
his own racing movie,

34:17.925 --> 34:19.622
"Le Mans."

34:19.753 --> 34:21.059
Who else you got in mind?

34:21.189 --> 34:22.712
You need a star, kid.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.412
Robert Redford.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.589
Redford?
Yeah, great idea.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.504
You get me Redford,

34:31.634 --> 34:34.768
you do it for a million five
all-in,

34:34.898 --> 34:36.335
you got yourself a go picture.

34:37.901 --> 34:38.902
Thanks, Bob.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.122
Sure, yeah, yeah.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.602
Evans is messing
with you, Al.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.952
Redford will never do this
for a million five all-in.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.823
How do you know?How is it that you don't?

34:46.954 --> 34:49.391
I don't know. I'm new at this.
Work with me here.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.610
Well, if anyone knows
what Redford's up to,

34:50.740 --> 34:53.091
it'll be Stevie Phillips.Who's he?

34:53.221 --> 34:54.570
She is his agent.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.703
You gotta know
these things, Al.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.925
Stevie Phillips please.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.667
This is Al Ruddy
calling from Paramount

35:04.798 --> 35:07.105
in regards to a project
for Robert Redford.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.632
Yes.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.157
Okay.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.811
Yes, I'll tell him.
Thank you.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.423
Stevie says to call back
when you have more than

35:21.554 --> 35:22.816
"Hogan's Heroes"
under your belt.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.123
Pass.So we go around her.

35:25.253 --> 35:26.602
That's not how things
are done, Al.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.256
I don't give a fuck
how things are done.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.866
Redford's not in town.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.608
He's shooting "Butch Cassidy"
outside San Pedro, Mexico.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.436
Find out
the most expensive hotel there.

35:34.567 --> 35:35.742
That'll be where
Redford's staying.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.700
And then book me a flight.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.137
You are certifiable.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.164
Hey, buddy.
I'm looking for Redford.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.470
And who are you?Producer of his next film.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.211
He said he wanted
to speak to me.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.344
Okay, just--
just wait right there.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.913
Action!
Butch and Sundance, go!

36:24.747 --> 36:25.922
And cavalry, go!

36:33.887 --> 36:35.758
All right.
Cut, cut, cut.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.326
All right.
Great, all right.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.285
Let's get set up
for the next shot.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.243
Let's go, people!
Let's go.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.071
We're burning daylight!

36:44.202 --> 36:45.507
So this is the guy?

36:48.815 --> 36:51.426
Producer of my next film, huh?That's right.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.733
Who the hell are you?Al Ruddy with Paramount.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.778
Huh, Paramount.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.563
Okay, so?

36:57.693 --> 36:58.738
So?

36:58.868 --> 37:00.740
It's a great
Charles Eastman script.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.655
Motorcycles and chicks.
You're gonna love it.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.091
Well, you didn't come
all the way down here

37:04.222 --> 37:06.049
to tell me that.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.704
Yeah, Bob, I did.

37:08.835 --> 37:12.012
Well, you could have called.
Paramount's suing me.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.014
That's why I didn't do
"Rosemary's Baby."

37:15.363 --> 37:17.235
Could've saved you the hassle.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.760
What if I could get you
out of that lawsuit?

37:29.421 --> 37:31.901
You have the authority
to do that?

37:33.338 --> 37:34.730
Yeah, I do...

37:36.515 --> 37:38.952
If you do the movie.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.524
Well, first things first,

37:45.654 --> 37:46.960
how about you and I
go get drunk later?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.397
You tell me who you are
and why I should work with you.

37:51.399 --> 37:52.618
Great.
I'm buying.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.055
No shit.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.103
Yeah.

38:00.234 --> 38:01.540
Ruddy.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.024
"Little Faus and Big Hals."

38:08.155 --> 38:10.505
"Fauss and Halsy."

38:14.509 --> 38:15.902
Ah.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.514
Evans is in this for himself,
not for Gulf and Western.

38:19.645 --> 38:21.299
I give you the reins,

38:21.429 --> 38:24.345
and the problems,
they just magically disappear?

38:24.476 --> 38:26.478
Ah, there's
my favorite Austrian.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.307
I missed this place.
Nice touch, Evans.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.396
Ask and you shall receive.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.659
Been a while since you've
visited the studio, Barry.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.095
Well, that's because
I've been in New York

38:35.225 --> 38:36.575
actually making money
for the company.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.316
Can you say the same?Play nice, children.

38:38.446 --> 38:39.621
Charlie,
you know Ann-Margret, right?

38:39.752 --> 38:41.971
Of course.
One of the greats.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.538
Good to see you, Charlie.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.497
A glass?From you? Sure.

38:45.627 --> 38:46.933
Thank you, honey.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.283
I would love to stay and chat,
but I'm wanted on set.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.416
I'll see you soon?You count on it.

38:51.546 --> 38:52.808
This way,
Miss Margret.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.856
Evans, you are
completely transparent.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.031
Well put.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.815
And I love it!

38:59.946 --> 39:01.948
Cheers.
Help yourself, Barry.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.080
Oh, and, uh, lighten up.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.560
Come on, Cheese.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.391
Ann-Margret
and two flutes of champagne

39:10.522 --> 39:13.176
is not gonna erase
ninth place, Evans.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.091
It's as if every
new Paramount picture

39:15.222 --> 39:16.571
comes with
its own death rattle.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.748
News flash,
you approved them too, Barry.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.186
Jack Warner
on line one for Mr. Bluhdorn.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.058
Jesus. Uh...

39:27.060 --> 39:28.191
Put him through.

39:28.322 --> 39:29.192
Ah, ah, ah.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.020
I don't pick up first.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.372
Jack Warner
doesn't wait on the line.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.156
Neither do I.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.723
You wait for Jack Warner.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.377
Everybody does.
He invented this business.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.902
Uh, Paramount,
holding for Mr. Warner.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.033
Hold please.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.209
Bluhdorn.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.863
Are you there?

39:47.994 --> 39:49.735
Bob Evans, Mr. Warner.
How you doing?

39:49.865 --> 39:51.780
I got Charlie here with me.

39:51.911 --> 39:55.393
Charlie,
you own "The Godfather."

39:55.523 --> 39:57.177
You doing anything with it?

39:57.307 --> 39:58.874
No.Yes.

40:00.354 --> 40:01.573
Well?

40:01.703 --> 40:03.923
We haven't decided.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.490
It's an uncut gem.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.361
Could be a crown jewel.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.710
I've been making
gangster movies

40:08.841 --> 40:10.495
since they were silent.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.236
We know how to make
this work, Charlie.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.108
I'll buy it today
for a million.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.763
Take it.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.330
We'll think about it.

40:20.461 --> 40:21.636
You do that.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.639
I won't wait forever.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.032
What does he know
that I don't?

40:26.162 --> 40:29.949
He knows that there's
movie gold in that book,

40:30.079 --> 40:31.385
which is why we took
a cheap, early option

40:31.516 --> 40:33.909
on the first 60 pages, $15,000,

40:34.040 --> 40:36.564
and that book has been at
number one for the past year.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.653
Barry, why didn't
I know about this?

40:38.784 --> 40:40.307
Yeah.
Why, Barry?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.309
Because our last
gangster movie

40:42.440 --> 40:44.616
was a sugarless turd.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.748
Yeah, because Kirk Douglas

40:46.879 --> 40:49.011
is a goyish Jew
playing an Italian.

40:49.142 --> 40:50.926
We're not gonna make
that mistake again.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.321
Charlie, gangster movies
are dead.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.410
All right? It's a new world.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.368
"James Bond," "Funny Girl,"

40:58.499 --> 40:59.979
that's what people want to see.

41:00.109 --> 41:03.156
Jack Warner, he offers me
a million, we can get three.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.897
Help cover some losses.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.682
Unless I'm missing something.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.510
Evans, what do you see
in this book?

41:10.598 --> 41:12.513
I'll tell you what I see.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.864
I see...money.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.605
This picture can make
Paramount number one, Charlie.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.085
I feel it.
I feel it.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.303
My kishkehs are screaming.

41:20.434 --> 41:21.522
That book's all
anyone's talking about.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.219
Now, you get the right hands
at the wheel

41:23.350 --> 41:24.917
and this could become
a cultural phenomenon,

41:25.047 --> 41:26.527
the likes
we've never seen before,

41:26.658 --> 41:29.487
like "Rosemary's Baby"

41:29.617 --> 41:31.271
but bigger.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.620
A million dollar return

41:32.751 --> 41:35.536
on an investment
of fifteen grand?

41:35.667 --> 41:36.929
We're not gonna get
a better offer.

41:41.237 --> 41:42.935
It's only a million.

41:43.065 --> 41:44.893
Thank you, Charlie.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.548
The bookstore
in Little Italy,

41:47.679 --> 41:48.810
"The Godfather."

41:48.941 --> 41:50.246
58 weeks at number one.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.857
'Cause of the tourists.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.772
Well,
it makes us look stupid.

41:53.902 --> 41:55.295
Like--you know, like a joke.

41:55.425 --> 41:56.818
And that's bad for business.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.646
Sinatra isn't wrong
about this one.

42:10.136 --> 42:12.617
We're here tonight
to acknowledge

42:12.747 --> 42:14.444
Joseph Anthony Colombo,

42:14.575 --> 42:16.664
capo to the Profaci Family.

42:21.887 --> 42:25.673
In recognition for his loyalty
to the commission,

42:25.804 --> 42:29.285
Joe, you have earned a seat
at the table amongst us.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.115
To the Colombo Family.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.988
May you live a long life
with prosperity.

42:36.902 --> 42:37.598
Salute!

42:37.729 --> 42:39.165
Salute!

42:54.659 --> 42:56.574
Some opening weekend.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.576
It's the studio.

42:58.706 --> 42:59.968
They didn't spend enough
on advertising.

43:00.099 --> 43:01.013
That's all.

43:01.143 --> 43:03.232
It's the movie,
not the marketing.

43:03.363 --> 43:04.582
Trust me.

43:06.845 --> 43:08.760
All right.
What are you in the mood for?

43:08.890 --> 43:10.588
I'll take you
anywhere you want.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.807
Nah, honey, I can't.
I gotta get home.

43:12.938 --> 43:14.374
Got a stack of scripts
I need to go through

43:14.504 --> 43:15.462
if I'm gonna
find my next project.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.637
Right now?Yeah.

43:16.768 --> 43:18.073
I thought we were
going to dinner.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.859
You okay
if we get something to go?

43:21.990 --> 43:23.513
If you tell me
what's really going on

43:23.644 --> 43:25.603
in that head of yours.

43:28.780 --> 43:32.610
I'm just scared to lose this,
producing,

43:32.740 --> 43:36.657
and I've never really
felt that before.

43:40.182 --> 43:42.228
Dan Tana's to-go?

43:42.358 --> 43:46.536
Sure.

43:56.155 --> 43:58.026
His secretary say what Evans
wanted to see me about?

43:58.157 --> 43:59.680
No.
But he likes you, Al.

43:59.811 --> 44:01.639
He's probably just checking in
to find out what's next.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.423
My film tanked.
What if he fires me?

44:03.553 --> 44:04.380
Then I'm fired too.

44:04.511 --> 44:06.382
Shit! Hey!

44:06.513 --> 44:07.993
Do not get fired.

44:09.298 --> 44:10.735
Yeah?

44:11.561 --> 44:12.998
Where's the chocolate, man?

44:13.128 --> 44:14.521
I mean,
I don't see any chocolate.

44:14.652 --> 44:15.653
It's a chocolate factory,
right?

44:15.783 --> 44:17.437
You see where
I'm going with this.

44:17.567 --> 44:18.612
Absolutely,
it's devoid of chocolate.

44:18.743 --> 44:21.093
Ruddy, pack your bags.
You're outta here.

44:21.223 --> 44:22.398
Fuck.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.662
New York.
You got a meeting

44:24.792 --> 44:25.837
with Charlie Bluhdorn
first thing in the morning.

44:25.967 --> 44:27.012
What, you thought
you were fired?

44:27.142 --> 44:28.056
That's sweet.

44:29.231 --> 44:29.275
You're not out
of the woods, but, you know.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.712
Okay, yeah.
What--whatever you need.

44:31.843 --> 44:33.366
But, uh, why am I doing this?

44:34.106 --> 44:36.151
You've read
"The Godfather," right?

44:36.282 --> 44:38.240
"The Godfather"?
Sure, who hasn't?

44:38.371 --> 44:39.024
I mean, you've read it.

44:39.981 --> 44:40.634
It's--it's great.
I love it.

44:41.591 --> 44:41.940
Well, you are officially now

44:42.941 --> 44:43.681
Paramount's
low budget specialist.

44:43.811 --> 44:45.160
We've been all over town.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.684
No one wants to make this movie
for four million dollars,

44:46.814 --> 44:48.816
so I need you to produce it.

44:49.774 --> 44:51.123
Get going.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.256
Nice.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.128
And, Ruddy...

44:56.998 --> 44:59.131
Don't fuck it up.

44:59.261 --> 45:00.828
You get 'em?

45:00.959 --> 45:02.830
I can't believe you told him
you read it.

45:02.961 --> 45:04.397
What else was I gonna say?

45:04.527 --> 45:06.181
You better read fast
on the plane.

45:06.312 --> 45:08.183
Fuck, that's big.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.760
It's about an American family.

45:19.891 --> 45:21.893
Bluhdorn is Austrian.
Make it universal.

45:23.764 --> 45:25.461
"The Godfather"
is a Greek tragedy

45:25.592 --> 45:26.854
about an Italian family.

45:26.985 --> 45:28.334
You say the word "tragedy"
to Charlie, and he says,

45:29.901 --> 45:30.858
"The only tragedy of my life
is that I bought Paramount."

45:30.989 --> 45:33.818
Okay,
it's a story about immigrants.

45:33.948 --> 45:35.733
Everybody in America
comes from immigrants.

45:35.863 --> 45:37.735
It's a universal story.You're overthinking it.

45:37.865 --> 45:40.607
Bluhdorn is famous
for being direct.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.740
He speaks like a telegram.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.742
So just be a telegram.

45:46.439 --> 45:47.832
Thanks.

45:59.147 --> 46:00.801
Al Ruddy for Charlie Bluhdorn.

46:00.932 --> 46:02.368
This way.

46:07.286 --> 46:08.461
Al Ruddy.

46:21.996 --> 46:24.129
Americans.

46:26.914 --> 46:29.177
Crime leads to murder
under the...

46:39.448 --> 46:42.408
Holden, you're fired.
Look at the seventh one.

46:42.538 --> 46:44.149
Location, what is that?

46:46.020 --> 46:47.326
Shut up, I don't want
to know what you think!

46:47.456 --> 46:49.894
So you're the genius
that Evans wants

46:50.024 --> 46:52.548
to produce the film
that we should not be making?

46:52.679 --> 46:54.028
You, stay.

46:57.553 --> 46:58.641
Ah.

47:01.427 --> 47:03.908
So tell me, Al Ruddy,

47:04.038 --> 47:06.171
what are you gonna do
with this fucking book?

47:11.567 --> 47:13.134
What?
Is he deaf?

47:22.187 --> 47:24.580
I'm going to make
an ice-blue, terrifying film

47:24.711 --> 47:26.147
about people you love.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.895
That is brilliant!

47:36.941 --> 47:38.333
You, come.

47:42.076 --> 47:43.469
What just happened?

47:44.949 --> 47:46.298
Congratulations.

47:47.429 --> 47:48.909
You're the producer
of "The Godfather."

47:56.003 --> 47:58.310
Ice-blue, baby.

47:58.919 --> 48:00.703
Well, hello
to the ice-blue,

48:00.834 --> 48:02.705
terrifying man of the hour.

48:04.011 --> 48:05.186
Nobody understands
what that means,

48:05.317 --> 48:07.275
but he loved it. Well done.

48:07.406 --> 48:10.061
Now, I wanna talk to you
about writers.

48:11.105 --> 48:14.282
William Goldman, great.
Waldo Salt, excellent.

48:14.413 --> 48:15.893
Look, Bob,
they're great writers,

48:16.023 --> 48:17.807
but we need
a fresh perspective.

48:17.938 --> 48:19.897
We need someone
who understands Italians.

48:20.027 --> 48:20.985
I wanna talk to Puzo.

48:21.115 --> 48:22.682
Oh, sweet Jesus.

48:22.812 --> 48:24.205
Puzo's never written a film.

48:24.336 --> 48:25.598
It's an unwritten law
in Hollywood

48:25.728 --> 48:27.078
that you never hire the author.

48:27.208 --> 48:29.080
They'll turn in
a 500-page first draft

48:29.210 --> 48:30.429
a year fucking late.

48:30.559 --> 48:32.083
Yeah, but he's the guy
with the original idea.

48:32.213 --> 48:33.780
It's at least worth a meeting.

48:34.563 --> 48:36.043
Look, I'm gonna talk to him
while I'm here in New York,

48:36.174 --> 48:38.263
and if I think he's the guy,
will you back me?

48:38.393 --> 48:40.569
Fuck no,
but it's your call.

48:44.095 --> 48:45.400
Everything all right?

48:46.227 --> 48:47.489
When was the last time
you made love in a pool?

49:03.027 --> 49:07.031
Al, I was born
to write this screenplay.

49:07.988 --> 49:09.468
Well, the studio
doesn't believe

49:09.598 --> 49:12.036
that an author
can adapt his own novel.

49:12.166 --> 49:13.385
Then why are you here?

49:14.821 --> 49:15.996
Because I told him.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.606
I said,
"Who knows it better than you?"

49:18.694 --> 49:21.001
Now, look, the movie's in here,
but you gotta carve it away.

49:21.132 --> 49:22.220
Can you do that?

49:23.612 --> 49:24.962
Thank you.

49:27.399 --> 49:29.140
Mario,
he asked you a question.

49:32.621 --> 49:34.188
All right, look.

49:37.713 --> 49:39.106
Fresh start.

49:39.237 --> 49:41.717
But I have to be the one
to write this.

49:41.848 --> 49:43.328
This is my story.

49:43.458 --> 49:46.200
The Corleones are my family.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.943
Can you deliver
a quick draft?

49:50.074 --> 49:51.075
What's quick?

49:51.205 --> 49:52.598
Three months.

49:55.122 --> 49:56.819
You let me do this,

49:56.950 --> 49:59.083
I'll do it in three days.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.389
Who can argue with that?

50:01.520 --> 50:02.695
Three days.
I'm gonna hold you to that.

50:02.825 --> 50:04.218
Hold on, hold on.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.611
I will let you take my husband,

50:05.741 --> 50:09.006
but you must promise me,
Mario has diabetes.

50:09.136 --> 50:10.572
Oh, Erika, please.No. No.

50:10.703 --> 50:12.009
Stop, now, come on.- Listen.

50:12.139 --> 50:13.967
You must watch his diet.Stop, stop.

50:14.098 --> 50:15.229
He eats crap.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.014
He needs to lose weight.

50:17.144 --> 50:19.277
Lock up the food.
No pizza.

50:19.407 --> 50:21.061
No ice cream.
No ice cream.

50:21.192 --> 50:22.541
No donuts.

50:22.671 --> 50:24.978
You must swear
a blood oath to this.

50:25.109 --> 50:27.807
Hon, he's a Jew.

50:27.937 --> 50:29.026
Ooh.

50:29.156 --> 50:31.985
He can't swear
a Catholic blood oath.

50:32.116 --> 50:33.508
I volunteer to swear.

50:34.683 --> 50:35.858
Thank you, see?

50:35.989 --> 50:37.338
L'chaim.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.784
So the studio got me
a whole house to write in?

50:48.915 --> 50:50.830
No, I got you the house.
They're just paying for it.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.832
Mr. Ruddy.
Nice to see you again.

50:52.962 --> 50:54.051
Good evening, sir.

50:54.181 --> 50:55.617
Your table will be ready
in a few minutes.

50:55.748 --> 50:56.836
Thanks, Marco.

50:58.011 --> 50:59.143
Yeah, it's not a bad night.

50:59.273 --> 51:00.448
What'd I miss?
What'd I miss?

51:00.579 --> 51:02.276
I got a drink.That's Frank Sinatra.

51:02.407 --> 51:04.670
Fucking Frank Sinatra!

51:04.800 --> 51:05.932
Amazing.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.977
I'm in the same room
with Sinatra.

51:08.108 --> 51:11.068
Look, Puzo, Chasen's is not
a celebrity petting zoo, okay?

51:11.198 --> 51:12.417
Now, stay here.
I gotta pee.

51:14.462 --> 51:16.073
MAITRE D':
Please, sir, this way.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.429
Sir--sir?

51:25.473 --> 51:28.041
Mr. Sinatra?Yeah?

51:28.172 --> 51:31.088
You have given me
and--and my family

51:31.218 --> 51:35.614
and my late sainted mother
so much pleasure.

51:35.744 --> 51:37.485
That's very kind of you
to say so.

51:37.616 --> 51:40.097
It's fans like you
that keep me going.

51:40.227 --> 51:42.621
You know, from--from
one artist to another,

51:42.751 --> 51:46.494
you teach the world
about true emotion.

51:46.625 --> 51:49.193
You're Mario Puzo?You know me?

51:49.323 --> 51:50.585
Yeah, I know who you are.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.370
You're the ratfink
who wrote that fucking book

51:52.500 --> 51:54.328
about the degenerate singer.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.679
You know, I--I've been
an admirer of yours

51:57.810 --> 51:58.854
since I was a kid.

51:58.985 --> 52:00.682
Well, I can't choose my fans,

52:00.813 --> 52:04.643
especially ones that make up
a story that insults Italians

52:04.773 --> 52:08.255
and a singer, world-famous,
who's a disgusting pervert

52:08.386 --> 52:09.952
and a faithless friend
of criminals.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.041
Johnny Fontane
is a fictional character.

52:12.172 --> 52:15.436
You find me one book review
in any language in the world

52:15.567 --> 52:18.309
that does not refer
to the singer Johnny Fontaine

52:18.439 --> 52:20.180
as having been based
on Frank Sinatra.

52:20.311 --> 52:21.660
Now, get the fuck out
of my sight

52:21.790 --> 52:24.184
before I have Jilly here
smack some respect into you.

52:24.315 --> 52:25.925
I will not be threatened
by anyone, okay?

52:26.055 --> 52:27.535
Including you, Mr. Sinatra.

52:27.666 --> 52:31.583
Oh, you wanna cross me,
you fat fuck, huh?

52:31.713 --> 52:34.238
Hey, hey!Huh?

52:34.368 --> 52:36.327
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no.

52:36.457 --> 52:38.981
No, not today.Hey, come on.

52:39.112 --> 52:40.983
Get out of here,
you fat fuck.

52:41.114 --> 52:44.030
Get the fuck out of here
before I smack you myself.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.249
Get him the fuck out of here.

52:45.379 --> 52:46.511
Sorry, Frank.Take it easy.

52:46.641 --> 52:47.555
Choke on it.

52:48.774 --> 52:50.123
Sorry about that.

52:50.254 --> 52:52.560
Sorry, folks.
Go back to eating.

52:53.039 --> 52:55.998
Evans is fucking pissed,

52:56.129 --> 52:57.130
and he's got every right to be.

52:58.305 --> 52:59.263
Sinatra and Puzo
are gonna hit the trades.

53:01.352 --> 53:03.223
My greatest achievement
so far as a producer

53:03.354 --> 53:04.964
is that Frank Sinatra
is mad at me.

53:06.270 --> 53:10.535
Well, that's more than
most people can say, no?

53:14.843 --> 53:16.236
I fucked it up, baby.

53:16.367 --> 53:18.325
Mais non.

53:18.456 --> 53:20.284
It was just starting
to go well too.

53:23.939 --> 53:25.724
You know what we're gonna do?

53:26.507 --> 53:28.683
We're gonna find
our own "Great Escape."

53:30.294 --> 53:33.819
So we're gonna start
with breakfast

53:33.949 --> 53:35.821
at Les Deux Magots.

53:35.951 --> 53:41.305
Then we're gonna do
steak frites at Brasserie Lipp.

53:41.435 --> 53:42.697
You like steak frites.

53:45.091 --> 53:48.312
And then we're gonna spend
the afternoon making love.

53:48.442 --> 53:49.748
That's what were gonna do.

53:50.923 --> 53:51.924
Paris, huh?

53:52.794 --> 53:54.405
For one week.

53:55.928 --> 53:57.886
Babe, all of your problems,
I can assure you,

53:58.017 --> 54:01.586
they're still gonna be here
when you get back,

54:01.716 --> 54:03.414
but your head will be clear.

54:08.593 --> 54:10.508
I can't, baby.
I gotta stay.

54:13.685 --> 54:14.816
Okay.

54:35.837 --> 54:36.969
Fuck.

54:40.581 --> 54:43.280
Mario, what's going on, man?

54:43.410 --> 54:46.283
I, uh--

54:46.413 --> 54:47.501
I can't do this.

54:48.415 --> 54:50.156
I'm a novelist.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.505
It takes me six years to write.

54:52.767 --> 54:54.813
What happened
to Mr. Three Days?

54:54.943 --> 54:59.208
Every time I sit down
to that typewriter,

54:59.339 --> 55:03.430
there's a blank page
laughing at me.

55:03.561 --> 55:05.302
I don't know why
I did this to myself.

55:05.432 --> 55:07.869
I mean, I'm a--

55:08.000 --> 55:10.307
I'm a--I'm a failure...No, you're not.

55:10.437 --> 55:14.006
At something that
I already made a success.

55:15.834 --> 55:17.575
I don't even know
where to begin.

55:19.707 --> 55:22.493
The book starts
with a wedding.

55:22.623 --> 55:24.408
The movie probably should too.

55:24.538 --> 55:26.758
Trust yourself
and write that scene.

55:30.196 --> 55:33.025
Movie scenes are abbreviations.

55:33.155 --> 55:34.940
They're snapshots.

55:35.723 --> 55:37.595
While the wedding
is going on in the garden,

55:37.725 --> 55:40.424
the bride's father is in
the office handing out favors.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.341
You wanna write it?

55:49.302 --> 55:51.957
It's been weeks, and Puzo
hasn't written a single word.

55:52.087 --> 55:54.220
Evans warned you
about hiring the novelist.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.527
Peter, we couldn't
find anybody else.

55:56.657 --> 55:59.486
The agencies won't touch us.
Not for a writer, a director.

55:59.617 --> 56:01.793
Ah, the town
wants this project to die

56:01.923 --> 56:03.925
to humiliate Evans for taking
a chance on the Rand guy

56:04.056 --> 56:05.710
who sold his first pitch
in the room.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.842
"Rand guy."It's not just you, Ruddy.

56:07.973 --> 56:09.714
Talent is scared of doing
a gangster movie

56:09.844 --> 56:11.368
after the last three bombed.

56:11.498 --> 56:12.630
So how do we fix it?

56:17.852 --> 56:20.681
Francis Ford Coppola.
He's brilliant.

56:20.812 --> 56:22.683
He wrote the script
for "Patton"

56:22.814 --> 56:24.555
and probably gonna be nominated
for an Oscar.

56:24.685 --> 56:27.514
Now, he might do this,
but he'll want to direct.

56:27.645 --> 56:30.430
Evans will need
to be talked into it.

56:30.561 --> 56:32.389
It's worth taking a shot.It's a great idea.

56:33.215 --> 56:35.043
Coppola owes Warners money,

56:35.174 --> 56:37.524
and he has a very expensive
setup in San Francisco.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.178
How do you know that?

56:39.308 --> 56:41.180
A girl never
reveals her secrets.

56:43.138 --> 56:44.531
You should give him a call.

56:45.750 --> 56:48.143
No.
Send Coppola the book.

56:48.274 --> 56:49.754
Tell him I'm on the way.Done.

56:51.538 --> 56:53.758
Did you tell him
to come to me?

56:56.761 --> 56:59.285
It was a good idea.Yeah, I got a lot of those.

57:02.331 --> 57:03.289
How embarrassing for you.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.596
I--I left you
a message not to come.

57:05.726 --> 57:08.468
Uh, I'm passing
on "The Godfather."

57:09.251 --> 57:10.731
I got the message,

57:10.862 --> 57:12.472
but I respect you
and what you stand for,

57:12.603 --> 57:14.474
so I came to hear
the reason why.

57:14.605 --> 57:16.781
Ah, okay, uh, as an Italian,

57:16.911 --> 57:19.566
I don't want to
glorify mafia violence.

57:20.611 --> 57:22.177
I agree with you.
You're right.

57:22.308 --> 57:25.267
I mean, how do you glorify men
who cut the head off a horse

57:25.398 --> 57:26.704
and put it in a producer's bed?

57:26.834 --> 57:28.836
Yes, that producer...

57:28.967 --> 57:29.968
Deserved it.

57:30.098 --> 57:32.492
Yes, he did.
It was a hell of a scene.

57:33.798 --> 57:36.017
And Sonny gunned down
at a toll booth.

57:36.888 --> 57:39.456
Or Michael seeing
his wife's car bombed in Sicily

57:39.586 --> 57:41.849
after the wedding,
I mean, priceless.

57:44.765 --> 57:46.985
Francis, let me be candid.

57:47.115 --> 57:48.987
You're in director jail.

57:49.117 --> 57:50.858
And the only movie I produced,
like your last movie,

57:50.989 --> 57:53.165
didn't exactly
set the world on fire.

57:54.340 --> 57:56.734
And in spite of that,
here I am,

57:56.864 --> 57:58.649
producer of the hottest novel
in the world,

57:58.779 --> 58:01.042
and I'm begging you
to take it on.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.305
You're a true artist.

58:03.436 --> 58:05.177
We need that.

58:09.442 --> 58:11.270
You help Mario Puzo
finish this script,

58:11.400 --> 58:12.880
we'll get you back
on the floor.

58:14.229 --> 58:15.709
Are you telling me
that Bob Evans

58:15.840 --> 58:17.755
is gonna let me
direct this film?

58:19.931 --> 58:22.324
It's not up to Bob.
It's up to you.

58:23.238 --> 58:26.503
Francis Ford Coppola will
help Puzo finish the script.

58:26.633 --> 58:28.766
Well, he's a great writer, man.
Smart move.

58:28.896 --> 58:31.595
He didn't, um, hustle you
to let him direct?

58:31.725 --> 58:33.597
No, I hustled him.

58:33.727 --> 58:35.512
Look, we need
an Italian to do this.

58:35.642 --> 58:36.774
He's got a great vision,

58:36.904 --> 58:39.167
but, uh, he could
tell you about it himself.

58:39.298 --> 58:40.604
Francis.

58:43.171 --> 58:44.608
Hello, Bob.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.045
Hey, Francis.

58:47.175 --> 58:48.829
How you been?

58:48.960 --> 58:50.483
He wanted to tell you
a little bit about

58:50.614 --> 58:51.832
what he's got in mind
for "The Godfather."

58:51.963 --> 58:54.356
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm all ears.

58:54.487 --> 58:55.967
Okay.

58:57.403 --> 58:58.926
So why is it
that "The Godfather"

58:59.057 --> 59:01.059
is selling more copies
than the Bible?

59:02.364 --> 59:03.844
You think it's about
the drug trade

59:03.975 --> 59:07.456
in 1946 New York City?
Not at all.

59:07.587 --> 59:11.112
It's a metaphor
for American capitalism.

59:12.026 --> 59:13.637
The American dream.

59:13.767 --> 59:16.117
The mythic battle
for control, okay?

59:16.248 --> 59:18.032
What is our opening line?

59:18.163 --> 59:20.165
"I believe in America."

59:21.383 --> 59:22.907
How perfect is that?

59:23.037 --> 59:26.606
And what is America
to this undertaker?

59:26.737 --> 59:29.566
It's a land of opportunity,

59:29.696 --> 59:32.612
and it's a justice system
that has failed him.

59:33.787 --> 59:36.137
It's Shakespeare.
It's Greek.

59:37.443 --> 59:39.750
Biblical. Epic.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.447
Evil versus evil.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.970
Fun.

59:43.101 --> 59:47.105
"The Godfather"
is a story about men,

59:47.235 --> 59:49.716
and they come together,
and they form a bond,

59:49.847 --> 59:54.112
and they find justice
through loyalty,

59:54.242 --> 59:56.505
not the fucking law.

59:56.636 --> 59:59.247
But at its core,

59:59.378 --> 1:00:01.772
this is a story about family.

1:00:01.902 --> 1:00:02.990
That's the secret sauce.

1:00:03.121 --> 1:00:05.776
That is what has captured
the hearts

1:00:05.906 --> 1:00:07.865
and minds of the whole world.

1:00:07.995 --> 1:00:11.651
You read it and you say,
"That's my family."

1:00:11.782 --> 1:00:14.001
That's your family.

1:00:14.132 --> 1:00:17.657
For Paramount,
it's the Corleone family.

1:00:17.788 --> 1:00:19.833
I know how to make this film.

1:00:19.964 --> 1:00:21.792
You need an Italian
to tell this tale.

1:00:21.922 --> 1:00:23.141
Four million all-in

1:00:23.271 --> 1:00:25.622
not including prints and ads,
I can do that.

1:00:25.752 --> 1:00:27.667
And, uh, he told me
to say that last part.

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:31.758
So that's it.

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:33.194
That's my pitch.

1:00:33.891 --> 1:00:35.719
That's great, Francis.

1:00:35.849 --> 1:00:37.938
That is great stuff.

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.898
Cheers.Cheers.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:42.856
I'm going to leave
you gentlemen to it.

1:00:42.987 --> 1:00:45.859
I'm sure that
we will be talking soon.

1:00:45.990 --> 1:00:48.427
Thanks, buddy.
Good stuff.

1:00:48.557 --> 1:00:51.560
Nice fucking ambush.

1:00:51.691 --> 1:00:53.867
Jesus, taking a leaf out
of my playbook.

1:00:53.998 --> 1:00:56.348
You don't like the rules much,
do you, Ruddy?

1:00:56.478 --> 1:00:57.305
I don't know the rules.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.920
Well, I guess it looks like
you got yourself a director.

1:01:03.050 --> 1:01:04.661
Nice work, kiddo.

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:06.924
Nice work.

1:01:08.795 --> 1:01:11.276
Tell me, how are
Nate's figures wrong again?

1:01:11.406 --> 1:01:13.626
That's two weeks in a row.
Send someone to see...

1:01:13.757 --> 1:01:14.758
All right, listen up.

1:01:17.891 --> 1:01:21.460
The fucking book
is still number one,

1:01:21.590 --> 1:01:23.549
and now they're making
a movie of it.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.290
Well, I ain't gonna
see it, boss.

1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:27.379
The Jews got the JDL.

1:01:27.509 --> 1:01:29.642
The Blacks got the NAACP.

1:01:29.773 --> 1:01:31.339
But who defends us,
the Italians?

1:01:31.470 --> 1:01:32.558
Nobody.Nobody.

1:01:32.689 --> 1:01:33.820
Well, I'm starting.

1:01:34.734 --> 1:01:36.867
Beginning now,

1:01:36.997 --> 1:01:39.347
the Italian-American
Civil Rights League.

1:01:40.871 --> 1:01:44.048
No gagootz is gonna
push us around anymore.

1:01:45.658 --> 1:01:47.442
What the fuck
are those flowers?

1:01:47.573 --> 1:01:49.314
It's from Sinatra.

1:01:50.271 --> 1:01:53.448
It's says, "Hopefully, we can
make this thing go away."

1:01:53.579 --> 1:01:54.711
It's a funeral wreath.

1:01:54.841 --> 1:01:56.234
The florist fucked up.

1:01:57.365 --> 1:01:59.150
No, he didn't fuck up.

1:02:01.021 --> 1:02:03.415
Sinatra wants us
to shut the picture down.

1:02:07.724 --> 1:02:10.074
Get me Mickey Cohen
in Los Angeles.

1:02:11.815 --> 1:02:13.294
It's time to send a message.

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:17.864
It smells delicious, guys.Yeah.

1:02:17.995 --> 1:02:19.344
It's a beautiful
piece of meat, huh?

1:02:19.474 --> 1:02:20.562
Mmm.

1:02:21.868 --> 1:02:23.870
Where you going
with that knife?

1:02:24.001 --> 1:02:27.526
I'm going to cut the fat
so that I can brown it.

1:02:27.656 --> 1:02:28.745
Brown it?

1:02:28.875 --> 1:02:30.790
My mother
never browned anything.

1:02:30.921 --> 1:02:32.574
She fried it.

1:02:32.705 --> 1:02:33.532
What's the difference?

1:02:36.404 --> 1:02:38.929
We have
to put this in the picture.

1:02:39.059 --> 1:02:41.758
What? A scene about
gangsters arguing over sauce?

1:02:41.888 --> 1:02:46.284
No, a scene about family
arguing over sauce.

1:02:46.414 --> 1:02:49.113
Huh?Huh?

1:02:50.810 --> 1:02:52.725
Let's open another
bottle of wine.

1:02:52.856 --> 1:02:54.161
I'll get it.

1:02:54.292 --> 1:02:56.337
You boys just keep on talking.

1:03:02.343 --> 1:03:03.823
I had a really lovely time.

1:03:03.954 --> 1:03:05.216
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.Yeah.

1:03:05.346 --> 1:03:06.173
My God.

1:03:07.174 --> 1:03:07.609
They can eat
a lot of food though.

1:03:09.307 --> 1:03:12.179
I think Puzo's been around
a kitchen once or twice.

1:03:12.310 --> 1:03:13.920
Yeah.

1:03:14.051 --> 1:03:17.271
I know, they're like
this old married couple.

1:03:17.402 --> 1:03:18.620
An old married couple
that needs to start

1:03:18.751 --> 1:03:19.578
turning in pages.

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:41.181
You've read The Godfather right?

1:04:42.748 --> 1:04:45.011
I knew only one thing about
the making of The Godfather,

1:04:45.142 --> 1:04:47.579
which was that Mario Puzo got
into a fight

1:04:47.709 --> 1:04:49.015
with Frank Sinatra in Chasen's.

1:04:49.146 --> 1:04:50.538
You know me?Yeah, I know who you are.

1:04:50.669 --> 1:04:52.366
Hey, hey, hey.So I had five minutes,

1:04:52.497 --> 1:04:55.326
and I only had to fill in 9
hours and 55 minutes more,

1:04:55.674 --> 1:04:56.893
and we'd have a show.

1:05:01.506 --> 1:05:03.247
The Godfather.Sure. Who hasn't?

1:05:03.377 --> 1:05:04.291
I mean, you've read it.

1:05:04.422 --> 1:05:05.423
It's, it's great. I love it.

1:05:06.598 --> 1:05:07.816
The Godfather has always sort of
just been

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:09.209
the North Star for me.

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.994
We approach the movie
with reverence,

1:05:11.124 --> 1:05:13.257
because it is definitely
one of the greatest movies

1:05:13.387 --> 1:05:14.084
of all time.

1:05:15.433 --> 1:05:15.694
When we first were in the
writers' room, we said,

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.697
"Okay, character arcs.
What is this really about?

1:05:18.827 --> 1:05:20.960
What story are we telling?
How do you tell 10 episodes

1:05:21.091 --> 1:05:22.744
about the making
of The Godfather?"

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:23.702
So our take on it

1:05:25.095 --> 1:05:27.619
was always to respect
the masterpiece that this is,

1:05:27.749 --> 1:05:29.969
because the story's really
about what's behind the scenes.

1:05:30.100 --> 1:05:32.189
It's really about how difficult
it was

1:05:32.319 --> 1:05:33.494
to get this movie made.

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:34.626
From early on,

1:05:35.975 --> 1:05:39.239
we talked about the fact
that The Offer explored

1:05:39.370 --> 1:05:41.894
like three disparate worlds.

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.983
Basically there are three
families in the movie.

1:05:44.114 --> 1:05:45.811
Coppola and the family
of the filmmakers.

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.030
Robert Evans and the family

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:49.771
of Gulf and Western,
the executives.

1:05:49.902 --> 1:05:52.861
And Joe Colombo
and the family of the mafia.

1:05:52.992 --> 1:05:54.211
Salute!

1:05:55.734 --> 1:05:58.693
And bouncing between those
three families is Al Ruddy.

1:05:58.824 --> 1:06:01.870
The story of Al Ruddy
trying to get this movie made,

1:06:02.001 --> 1:06:03.133
and what he and Coppola,

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:05.439
and everybody went through
to get it made

1:06:05.787 --> 1:06:06.875
is just astounding.

1:06:07.006 --> 1:06:08.312
One of the joys
of the script is,

1:06:08.442 --> 1:06:10.314
is that there's so much tension.

1:06:10.444 --> 1:06:12.185
We know it was made,
and yet when you're doing it,

1:06:12.316 --> 1:06:15.014
you're like, it seems like it
could fall down at any minute.

1:06:15.145 --> 1:06:15.972
We've been all over town,

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:17.756
no one wants to make this
movie for $4 million.

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:19.845
So I need you to produce it.

1:06:19.976 --> 1:06:22.021
Not only was he a producer

1:06:22.152 --> 1:06:24.937
that was having to
battle the studio system,

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:28.201
but he was also battling
the real life mafia.

1:06:28.332 --> 1:06:30.073
For every character
in the story,

1:06:30.203 --> 1:06:31.422
getting this movie made

1:06:31.552 --> 1:06:33.076
or stopping this movie
from being made,

1:06:33.206 --> 1:06:35.252
was a matter of life and death,
literally.

1:06:37.863 --> 1:06:39.778
What I really enjoy about
this character, and with Al,

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:41.780
is that he's such a man
of action.

1:06:42.085 --> 1:06:44.087
These were some
really serious situations

1:06:44.217 --> 1:06:45.523
that Al was in. Very dangerous.

1:06:45.653 --> 1:06:47.568
You don't like the rules much,
do you Ruddy?

1:06:47.699 --> 1:06:48.308
I don't know the rules.

1:06:49.788 --> 1:06:51.964
You borderline have to be
kind of insane to do the stuff

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:54.314
that he did
to get this movie made,

1:06:54.445 --> 1:06:58.014
because he really did feel
with every fiber of his being

1:06:58.449 --> 1:07:00.016
that this script was worth it,

1:07:00.146 --> 1:07:01.321
that these actors were worth it,

1:07:01.452 --> 1:07:03.671
that it was all worth it.

1:07:03.802 --> 1:07:07.023
Nice work kiddo, nice work.

1:07:07.545 --> 1:07:09.764
We like to pay homage to
the movie whenever we can,

1:07:10.113 --> 1:07:12.158
and we do it in certain
episodes.

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:13.681
Hello, Bob.

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:16.684
There's a specific scene where
that really came home for me.

1:07:16.815 --> 1:07:18.686
Hey, hey, Francis. How you been?

1:07:18.817 --> 1:07:23.604
He is pitching to Ruddy
and Evans in the bar,

1:07:23.735 --> 1:07:24.344
and he says...

1:07:25.650 --> 1:07:28.131
The Godfather
is a story about men.

1:07:28.261 --> 1:07:32.222
Men, brothers, businessmen,
who come together...

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:35.138
...And they form a bond
and they find justice

1:07:35.964 --> 1:07:37.227
through loyalty.

1:07:38.750 --> 1:07:40.708
And I thought, "Oh, shit! That's
exactly what we're doing."

1:07:40.969 --> 1:07:42.014
It's a metaphor.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:43.711
You have
these three brothers

1:07:43.842 --> 1:07:45.104
coming from different places

1:07:45.235 --> 1:07:47.237
coming together to try to get
this made,

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:49.065
arguing like a family,

1:07:49.195 --> 1:07:50.936
like the three brothers
might be arguing

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:52.242
in the Corleone family.

1:07:53.678 --> 1:07:54.461
To us, it was important to
follow each of their arcs

1:07:55.506 --> 1:07:56.333
and have each of them
have conflict.

1:07:57.551 --> 1:07:59.814
You read it and you
say, "That's my family."

1:08:00.119 --> 1:08:01.033
They fight.

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:02.165
They yell at each other.

1:08:02.295 --> 1:08:03.470
They don't like each other
sometimes,

1:08:03.601 --> 1:08:05.081
but at the end, they
come back for each other.

1:08:05.211 --> 1:08:07.213
That is great stuff.
