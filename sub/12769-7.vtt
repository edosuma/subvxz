01:20.083 --> 01:21.542
( bag rips )

01:26.250 --> 01:28.333
( in distorted voice ):
Charlotte?

01:37.375 --> 01:39.542
Charlotte.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.917
Close the door.

01:41.959 --> 01:44.542
I don't want
anyone to see me.

01:47.917 --> 01:50.542
PETE ( whispers ):
Okay. Okay.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.709
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh. I got you.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.458
( Charlotte crying )

01:55.500 --> 01:56.583
PETE:
Shh, shh.

( Charlotte grunting )

02:00.208 --> 02:03.166
( crowd murmuring )

02:03.208 --> 02:06.041
Is that Dr. King?
Is there anything that we can--?

02:06.083 --> 02:08.709
PETE: I got it.
She needs to be admitted--

02:08.750 --> 02:10.375
I've got it.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.709
( Charlotte sighs )

02:18.750 --> 02:21.542
He took my wallet.
That's what he--

02:21.583 --> 02:22.750
He robbed me.

02:24.709 --> 02:25.917
Can you lie back for me?

02:25.959 --> 02:28.000
I would've just
given it to him, but he--

02:28.041 --> 02:30.583
I don't know,
he just kept hitting me.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.750
I need you to lie back
so I can take a look at you.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.166
I'm fine.

02:34.208 --> 02:38.041
My hand hurts. I got robbed.
He took my wallet. I just--

02:38.083 --> 02:41.083
I need a bandage
and I'll be good as new.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.000
Charlotte, your hand is broken.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.000
So's your wrist.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.625
Maybe your nose.

02:49.792 --> 02:52.792
Possibly your eye socket.

02:54.792 --> 02:57.041
Oh.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.000
Let me examine you.

02:59.041 --> 03:00.417
( sighs )

03:02.458 --> 03:05.458
( grunting )

03:07.917 --> 03:11.166
I can't take medication.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.041
Pills. You know that.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.333
I know.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.041
I need a gown.
Okay.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.917
And a nurse to get me into it.
All right.

03:21.709 --> 03:24.583
Get Sheila.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.041
Not one of those nosy bitches
out there.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.792
Sheila.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.875
She knows how to keep
her mouth shut. She's on four.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.834
Okay. I'll go get Sheila
and I'll be right back.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.625
But, Charlotte, please...

03:35.667 --> 03:39.458
Please, lie back.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.500
( winces )

( line ringing )

04:13.333 --> 04:14.542
( Pete sighs )

04:14.583 --> 04:16.917
There's a nurse named Sheila
on four. Go get her.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.709
One of you call the police.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.291
And all of you get back to work.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.667
( dialing )

04:25.500 --> 04:26.834
( buzzing )

04:26.875 --> 04:28.959
SAM:
You don't ask your bride-to-be
about strippers.

04:29.000 --> 04:29.959
They don't like it.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.083
Besides, strippers are--
There are germs.

04:33.125 --> 04:35.041
I'm not gonna do anything
with the stripper.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.834
It's a rite of passage.
Get the stripper.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.542
Every man should have a woman
dance on a table for him

04:40.583 --> 04:43.542
before he takes the plunge.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.750
Hell, you want me to take
my top off and dance now?

04:45.792 --> 04:46.875
Because I will.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.458
Oh, I'm drunk.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.041
I know I'm drunk because
I just considered

04:51.083 --> 04:52.083
doing very bad things to you.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.166
Things that involve spankings.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.667
( Amelia laughs )

04:56.709 --> 04:58.750
I like you.
I like everybody.

04:58.792 --> 04:59.750
Okay, back up.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.000
( in high voice ):
"Okay, back up."

05:01.041 --> 05:02.709
I hate being
the designated driver.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.041
( buzzing )

05:04.083 --> 05:06.041
AMELIA:
Yeah, well, even with three
drinks in me,

05:06.083 --> 05:08.208
I can still
kick your ass at pool.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.500
PRICE:
Two unis found him.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.583
He was wandering the streets,
shouting to himself.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.500
In L.A.? Heh. Shocking.
Heh. I know, right?

05:16.542 --> 05:19.542
But here's the deal.
He had blood on his clothes.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.166
And you didn't take him to the
hospital? You and I both know--

05:22.208 --> 05:23.625
Not his blood.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.542
He had scratches on him, a
pretty good bruise on his face,

05:27.583 --> 05:28.750
but it wasn't his blood.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.333
We tried to talk to him,
we tried to help him.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.583
He kicked one of the unis.
They had to arrest him.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.500
Because there aren't any actual
criminals in L.A.

05:35.542 --> 05:37.375
I was sleeping, you know.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.542
Shelly, I'm trying to do
a good thing here.

05:40.583 --> 05:42.583
He's a messed up guy.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.041
Now, maybe he witnessed
something,

05:44.083 --> 05:45.375
maybe he did something bad.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.041
But you're on the 5150 team,

05:47.083 --> 05:49.166
so do your job.
Evaluate the guy.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.291
( sighs )

05:52.333 --> 05:55.458
PRICE:
His name's Lee.
That's all we could get.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.291
Do me a favor.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.583
Turn off the cameras, huh?

06:10.166 --> 06:13.959
He was about 5'8" or bigger.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.667
Blond, maybe. Maybe brown hair.
I don't know.

06:16.709 --> 06:21.041
He had on jeans or khakis.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.041
I don't know for sure
what he was wearing. Ow.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.583
Sorry. Are you positive this
guy's not still in the building?

06:25.625 --> 06:27.458
Security did a sweep
floor to floor.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.208
Does that mean you're sure or
are you just saying you're sure?

06:31.250 --> 06:35.542
Addison, what are you doing
here? You're not on call.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.500
I had a mom who thought
that she was in labor.

06:40.542 --> 06:43.041
It was a false alarm.
And then I heard.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.709
Is there anything else you can
tell us? Did he say anything?

06:45.750 --> 06:46.917
PETE:
She's told you everything.

06:46.959 --> 06:49.041
He didn't say anything.
See? Now find the guy.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.792
POLICEMAN 1:
We have to complete the report.

06:50.834 --> 06:52.041
PETE:
Report.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.375
POLICEMAN 1:
And the forensic nurse
needs samples.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.917
PETE:
Screw that. She's injured.
She needs medical attention.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.417
POLICEMAN 1:
There's a process here.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.041
PETE:
She's been through enough.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.667
POLICEMAN 2:
Now you're getting
in the way of us doing our job.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.041
PETE:
Your job is to find the guy.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.667
There's a violent criminal
out there.

07:06.709 --> 07:09.458
I'm sorry.
Okay, everybody out. Move.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.959
Ma'am--
ADDISON: I said, out.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.125
PETE:
Come on. Let's go. Out.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.375
( Charlotte coughs )

07:16.792 --> 07:18.875
You too.
I haven't finished. She needs--

07:18.917 --> 07:20.083
Pete.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.083
Life's a bitch, ain't it?

07:42.709 --> 07:44.917
Let's get you cleaned up.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.792
( crowd chattering )

07:57.166 --> 07:58.709
( Cooper speaking indistinctly )

07:58.750 --> 08:00.083
Hey. What are you--?

08:00.125 --> 08:02.750
COOPER:
Violet!
You're in a bar with a baby!

08:02.792 --> 08:06.458
Are you loco?
Have you gone la cuckoo?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.000
Why don't you people
answer your phone?

08:09.250 --> 08:10.500
What's wrong?

08:10.542 --> 08:12.959
( Violet speaking indistinctly )

08:13.000 --> 08:15.583
( crowd chattering )

08:17.333 --> 08:19.583
Coop, wait.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
( camera clicking )

08:35.750 --> 08:38.041
Okay, thank you.
I have everything.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.542
I just need
to bag your clothes, okay?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.041
That's the worst of it.

08:48.208 --> 08:51.667
Charlotte, it means a lot
that you called me.

08:51.709 --> 08:53.792
I know that
we haven't always...

08:56.458 --> 08:59.834
I'm here for you,
whatever you need, okay?

08:59.875 --> 09:01.458
NURSE:
Underwear?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.625
What?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.625
I have a dress,
a bra, two shoes,

09:05.667 --> 09:07.625
but there's no underwear.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.625
Oh.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.375
I don't wear underwear.

09:11.417 --> 09:15.000
They just get in the way.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.208
She doesn't. I think it's gross,

09:18.250 --> 09:21.500
but to each his own, right?

09:21.542 --> 09:23.000
I guess.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.709
( door closes )

09:44.250 --> 09:48.709
You'll need the HIV cocktail,
the morning-after pill,

09:48.750 --> 09:52.458
STD prophylaxis and a pelvic.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.542
Right?

09:56.875 --> 09:58.375
( sighs )

10:00.333 --> 10:02.000
Right.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.250
( sniffs )

10:11.667 --> 10:13.667
( whimpering )

10:19.166 --> 10:22.166
( sobbing )

10:39.000 --> 10:42.208
I don't think I want you
down there one-handed.

10:45.792 --> 10:49.041
I just need to examine you for
any internal tears or injuries,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.750
then I'll do a rape kit.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.041
I'll collect pubic hairs,
pelvic washings, blood samples--

10:53.083 --> 10:55.041
No rape kit.

10:55.083 --> 10:58.500
I wasn't raped, I was robbed.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.834
Charlotte--
No rape kit.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.041
Charlotte--
What you and I know,

11:03.083 --> 11:06.500
those cops out there,
they don't know.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.792
They know I was robbed.
Now, you can't tell anyone.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.917
No rape kit.

11:11.959 --> 11:16.166
I'm so sorry, Charlotte,
but I have a legal obligation--

11:16.208 --> 11:18.041
( grunts )

11:18.083 --> 11:19.250
I called you.

11:20.792 --> 11:21.917
I called you.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.542
Okay. It's okay.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.542
No rape kit.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.667
He took my wallet.

11:30.709 --> 11:33.000
He didn't take anything else.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.625
No rape kit.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.709
No rape.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.667
Hey. How is she?

12:02.709 --> 12:04.500
PETE:
She's with Addison.
She's okay considering--

12:04.542 --> 12:05.667
What the hell happened?

12:05.709 --> 12:07.500
A guy beat her up,
stole her wallet.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.291
Where are the cops?
Cops are on it.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.583
Okay. What the hell happened,
Pete?

12:11.625 --> 12:14.041
I mean-- I mean, where is she?
I mean, where is she?

12:14.083 --> 12:16.291
I need to know.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.041
Whoa, hold on. Hold on.
Easy. Easy. Come over here.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.583
Come over here.
They were in a bar.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.583
The nanny's coming to pick up
Lucas. Can you--?

12:22.625 --> 12:26.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Go.
All right.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.875
Are you sober?
Below the legal limit.

12:27.917 --> 12:30.083
Charlotte took a blow to her
eye socket and vomited.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.625
Could be a concussion--

12:31.667 --> 12:33.834
I'll get a CT of her head and
facial bones, do a neuro exam.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.500
SAM: It's okay.
COOPER: It's not okay.

12:35.542 --> 12:37.500
Charlotte is hurt and I'm not--
SAM: You're drunk.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.250
Okay, Charlotte's hurt
and I'm drunken.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.542
SAM:
Calm down. Calm down.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.208
Charlotte's hurt.
Yes.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.750
Okay, I'm gonna kill somebody.
I'm gonna kill somebody.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.625
PETE: Come on, Coop. Calm down.
COOPER: Let me go!

12:46.667 --> 12:48.041
( all speaking indistinctly )

12:48.083 --> 12:49.500
Guys, come on! I'm calm.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.625
Calm down.
I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm calm.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.041
Sorry.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.458
( groans )

12:59.500 --> 13:00.834
Ow!

13:00.875 --> 13:03.458
SAM:
Coop.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.667
What the hell happened?

13:05.709 --> 13:08.500
Can you tell me
what you were doing?

13:09.959 --> 13:14.125
You were on the streets.
You seemed confused, they said.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.625
Were you nervous?
Is that why you kicked the cop?

13:18.083 --> 13:21.542
You're clean, you're well-fed.
You're not homeless.

13:22.709 --> 13:23.709
Is someone missing you?

13:23.750 --> 13:27.375
Do you need me
to help get you home?

13:27.417 --> 13:30.083
Or away from home,
or, uh...?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.709
I'm not a cop.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.333
I hate cops.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.834
They call me Shelly, and I hate
guys that call me Shelly.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.959
I just wanna make sure
you're okay.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.000
I'm on your side.

14:01.583 --> 14:04.750
I had a bad night.

14:04.792 --> 14:07.583
( Lee whimpering )

14:11.875 --> 14:13.792
That happens.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.709
( Lee crying )

14:25.083 --> 14:26.208
COOPER:
Ouch.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.834
Sobering up?
I can hang another bag.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.250
No, I'm sober.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.625
I need to get to Charlotte.
You need to let the bag finish.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.041
I need to get to Charlotte--
ADDISON: Hey.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.834
PETE: How's she doing?
What room is she in?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.625
You need to prepare yourself.
She doesn't look great.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.000
I can handle it.
What room is she in?

14:41.041 --> 14:42.208
524E.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.000
Uh--
Okay.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.667
Hell of a night.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.667
Hoo. Yeah.

14:52.709 --> 14:54.250
It's good you were here.

14:54.291 --> 14:56.667
A woman who's been attacked

14:56.709 --> 14:59.000
is usually more comfortable
with another woman.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.291
Yeah.
Addison?

15:03.333 --> 15:04.917
( sighs )

15:31.959 --> 15:33.166
Coop.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.041
Coop, come here.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.542
( Cooper sighs )

15:38.583 --> 15:40.375
Come here.

16:06.458 --> 16:09.750
I'm okay, Coop.
Okay.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.792
I'm okay.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.583
It's gonna be okay.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.375
It's important you don't move
while the CT--

16:22.417 --> 16:25.041
I know how a CT works.

16:25.083 --> 16:28.291
Sorry. Of course you do.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.583
You know you're gonna need
stitches.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.750
Yay for me.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.041
I could page somebody
in Plastics.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.792
I don't wanna involve Plastics.

16:42.458 --> 16:46.166
Less people that know your
business, the better. I get it.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.166
( beeps )

16:50.625 --> 16:53.709
I could do them.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.125
I got a gift with sutures.

16:56.166 --> 16:59.333
Never leave a scar.
It's freakish how good I am.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.208
Thank you.

17:02.250 --> 17:06.041
Plus, you get the good drugs
that go along with stitches.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.375
No drugs for me.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.250
God grant me the serenity

17:19.291 --> 17:21.583
to accept the things
I cannot change.

17:24.917 --> 17:28.041
The courage
to change the things I can.

17:28.083 --> 17:31.667
( in unison ):
And the wisdom to know
the difference.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.834
I thought you seemed
like one of my people.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.333
Well,
it takes one to know one.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.375
( Charlotte grunts )

17:42.458 --> 17:44.542
I've been
drinking a lot lately.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.375
No pills, but, um...

17:49.417 --> 17:52.417
Drinking.
Which is a gateway.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.709
You been going to meetings?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.625
No.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.000
You need to take your butt
to meetings.

18:01.750 --> 18:05.291
I'll go with you.
I know the best ones.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.625
Thanks.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.333
No problem.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.792
Now remember, don't move.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.417
The nanny said she'll watch
Lucas as long as we need.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.625
We should pay her more.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.917
She's probably a lawyer
in her country or something.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.709
Heh. Violet.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.208
No, I'm saying
she takes care of our son.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.792
She keeps him safe. We should
pay her everything we have.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.500
The world's a dangerous place.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.166
Hey. I was just texting Naomi.
She's freaking out,

19:02.208 --> 19:03.875
but she told me
to tell you that she knows

19:03.917 --> 19:05.291
you have everything covered.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.583
Yeah. Is she coming home?

19:07.625 --> 19:09.083
She can't.
She's stuck in Zurich

19:09.125 --> 19:11.333
doing some money thing
for William's foundation.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.041
Mm. Um,
should we call Sheldon?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.750
I tried.
He's working at the precinct.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.208
Unreachable.
I'll tell him in the morning.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.000
Oh, okay.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.625
What?
Hoo.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.250
Nothing. It's just that Nai and
Sheldon always know what to do.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.041
( sighs )

19:31.083 --> 19:33.333
Addison?

19:33.375 --> 19:34.959
What?

19:38.208 --> 19:40.709
Hey. Addison.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.000
Nothing, it's just, um...

19:44.542 --> 19:46.333
It's just been a hard night.

19:46.375 --> 19:47.750
Mm.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.125
Oh, Addison.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.750
I'm so grateful it wasn't you.
Don't say that.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.000
You don't know
what Charlotte's going through.

20:05.041 --> 20:08.166
I'm sorry, but I--

20:08.208 --> 20:09.834
With everything-- Maya--

20:09.875 --> 20:12.709
I don't know if I could handle
any more bad news.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.583
Right.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.208
I get that.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.834
I gotta go.
Yeah. Right.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.041
Amelia's doing a CT on Charlotte
and she needs me.

20:22.083 --> 20:25.000
Uh, Addison--
Right. Okay.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.458
I'd really like it
if you told me

20:38.500 --> 20:41.375
what you meant when
you said you had a bad night.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.792
It was bad.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.917
That's all I wanna say about it
right now, okay?

20:45.959 --> 20:48.041
Okay.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.000
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.250
Okay.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.709
What's your last name?

21:02.709 --> 21:05.041
McHenry.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.291
That's a good name.
Hmm.

21:09.959 --> 21:13.250
Have you ever thought of, uh,

21:13.291 --> 21:17.000
I don't know, hurting yourself
or hurting someone else?

21:18.458 --> 21:20.041
I just wanna go home.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.458
I know you do.
And I-I'm sorry, but you can't.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.125
Not yet. Not until you tell me
what happened tonight.

21:26.166 --> 21:30.041
There's no hurry,
I don't want you to feel rushed,

21:30.083 --> 21:34.000
but you can't go home until you
tell me. You understand?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.500
This room is gross.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.166
Yeah.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.917
Yeah.
It smells like urine.

21:44.959 --> 21:46.542
Yeah.

21:46.583 --> 21:47.542
I don't like it.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.542
I don't like it.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.208
Who hurt you, Lee?

22:09.208 --> 22:11.166
AMELIA:
You ready?

22:11.208 --> 22:12.834
You can't take anything
for this pain?

22:12.875 --> 22:16.000
She's allergic to local
anesthetics and she's in N.A.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.583
CHARLOTTE:
I'm fine. Just do it.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.417
( Charlotte screams )

22:31.375 --> 22:34.625
( groaning )

22:36.125 --> 22:37.709
How many more?

22:37.750 --> 22:39.834
You're doing great, Charlotte.

22:39.875 --> 22:41.166
How many more?

22:42.500 --> 22:45.166
It's a guess, but maybe 50.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.500
( Charlotte screaming )

22:54.500 --> 22:57.458
( groaning )

23:03.375 --> 23:06.375
So now how many more?
Go get a cup of coffee.

23:06.417 --> 23:08.667
No, I'm not leaving her.
CHARLOTTE: Cooper.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.041
I could use some coffee.

23:10.083 --> 23:13.041
Uh-uh.
CHARLOTTE: Really, I could.

23:13.083 --> 23:14.792
Look at me, Cooper.

23:14.834 --> 23:18.500
It's okay.
You go, come back with coffee.

23:18.542 --> 23:21.959
A latte. Please.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.542
( door opens then closes )

23:28.625 --> 23:32.041
I'm gonna start again.
You ready?

23:32.083 --> 23:33.709
Yeah.

23:35.250 --> 23:38.250
( Charlotte groaning )

23:47.709 --> 23:49.625
VIOLET:
Pete said
there's no neuro damage.

23:49.667 --> 23:50.625
( sighs )

23:50.667 --> 23:52.417
Good. That's good.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.208
I called the cops.
There's no news,

23:54.250 --> 23:55.875
but I'm gonna stay
on top of them.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.041
Call them every day.

23:57.083 --> 23:58.750
And I checked
our home security system.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.750
We have a doorman,
but I'm gonna hire somebody

24:00.792 --> 24:01.834
to watch the apartment

24:01.875 --> 24:03.542
because maybe that'll
make her feel safer.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.083
People never feel safe
after an attack.

24:05.125 --> 24:07.542
I mean, you hid in the closet
when the doorbell rang.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.709
So I'm thinking an armed man
outside our apartment door

24:09.750 --> 24:11.625
would give her some
peace of mind. Right?

24:11.667 --> 24:14.458
What do you think that costs,
like 50, 60 bucks an hour?

24:14.500 --> 24:15.542
I can cover that.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.083
And maybe she'll need
a bodyguard,

24:17.125 --> 24:19.000
you know,
like a 24-hour-a-day person

24:19.041 --> 24:21.583
to go with her everywhere
for a while.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.000
Cooper.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.542
I'm supposed to protect her.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.542
I know it's the 21st century

24:30.583 --> 24:33.291
and you women
have all surpassed us

24:33.333 --> 24:34.792
in lifespan,
academic achievement,

24:34.834 --> 24:37.041
intelligence and...

24:37.083 --> 24:39.709
You know, well,
everything else, but...

24:39.750 --> 24:42.166
When I was a kid,
my dad taught me one thing.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.750
He said, "You find a woman,

24:43.792 --> 24:45.375
"you marry her,
you get her pregnant,

24:45.417 --> 24:47.542
and you spend the rest of your
life taking care of her."

24:47.583 --> 24:50.583
Maybe that's Cro-Magnon
or something, but...

24:53.083 --> 24:56.750
I mean, I'm her man.
I'm supposed to keep her safe.

25:00.417 --> 25:04.542
Well, I have been where she is,
and I can tell you

25:04.583 --> 25:07.166
that you
don't have to be tough,

25:07.208 --> 25:10.125
you just have to be there.

25:10.166 --> 25:13.083
Okay?

25:13.125 --> 25:15.625
Okay. Now come here.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.542
You know,
and for the record,

25:23.583 --> 25:26.041
Cro-Magnon is a relief
sometimes.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.208
Sometimes Cro-Magnon
is really hot.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.000
Right?

25:34.291 --> 25:37.125
Do you know what this is?

25:37.166 --> 25:38.959
It's your file.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.583
It's not thick, it's just
a couple of pages,

25:40.625 --> 25:42.834
so that's good, okay?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.458
Okay.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.458
What's it say?

25:54.500 --> 25:57.625
No criminal record. Dishonorable
discharge from the Navy.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.917
That was a long time ago.
I know.

25:59.959 --> 26:04.166
I know. It's just that
it's in your file, so...

26:04.208 --> 26:08.000
I have a job now. I have a
girlfriend. I'm normal now.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.917
Can you tell me about
your girlfriend?

26:10.959 --> 26:12.500
We had a fight.

26:12.542 --> 26:16.500
A fight. When? Tonight?

26:16.542 --> 26:20.375
She was screwing this guy
in our bed and I caught her.

26:20.417 --> 26:22.125
Well, that sounds like
quite a fight.

26:24.250 --> 26:29.583
She was throwing stuff
and, uh, I was yelling.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.917
And then she hit me.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.250
Hmm. You were angry.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.333
No, I wasn't. No.

26:34.375 --> 26:38.417
No, she's-- She's my whole life.
My whole life.

26:38.458 --> 26:43.041
She's my everything, you know?
She's real sweet, a good person.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.500
I just don't understand
why she would...

26:46.542 --> 26:47.542
You felt betrayed.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.500
You know what that
betrayal is called?

26:50.542 --> 26:54.041
A stressor. It adds stress
to your life.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.458
A lot of stress.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.083
Yeah.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.750
Stress about covers it.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.041
You have a lot of blood
on your clothes, Lee.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.959
Where'd that come from?

27:14.792 --> 27:16.792
( papers rustling )

27:18.583 --> 27:21.125
Hey.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.041
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.500
I wasn't really asleep.

27:26.542 --> 27:30.750
I don't think I'm gonna be
sleeping much ever again.

27:33.625 --> 27:36.291
Charlotte--
Don't.

27:37.583 --> 27:40.709
He could do this
to someone else.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.792
Charlotte,
if you don't report this...

27:46.333 --> 27:49.041
There are other women
to think about here.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.750
I said, don't.

27:50.792 --> 27:52.583
There's no shame.

27:52.625 --> 27:57.041
It's not your fault. You need
support, counseling. You need--

27:57.083 --> 27:59.417
If you try
to keep this secret,

27:59.458 --> 28:02.875
it is going to eat you alive.
I know it.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.792
You ever been violated?

28:09.041 --> 28:11.750
Anybody rape you lately?

28:13.709 --> 28:14.875
I'm trying to help.

28:14.917 --> 28:18.375
No, hey, let me tell you
what it's like.

28:18.417 --> 28:19.875
You know those
made-for-TV movies

28:19.917 --> 28:22.250
where some woman's always
crouched down naked in a shower

28:22.291 --> 28:24.542
holding her knees and sobbing

28:24.583 --> 28:25.792
because when she closes her eyes

28:25.834 --> 28:29.041
she can still feel
the guy's hands on her?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.041
How, when they show the attack,

28:31.083 --> 28:33.875
the woman's eyes
go all blank and still?

28:33.917 --> 28:35.542
She goes to some other place
in her mind

28:35.583 --> 28:38.166
just to deal with the horror
of what's happening to her

28:38.208 --> 28:41.417
while some Lilith Fair song
plays?

28:42.792 --> 28:44.709
It is nothing like that.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.250
It's dirty.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.208
And sweaty.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.583
And he licks your face.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.458
And he wipes himself off
in your hair.

28:55.500 --> 29:00.542
And when you try to scream, he
punches you so hard you see God.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.166
And then he goes at you again.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.041
Ripping stuff
you didn't even know you had

29:08.083 --> 29:11.000
because he enjoyed it so much
the first time.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.041
I know you're trying to help.

29:22.083 --> 29:25.250
But if helping me means
that everyone,

29:25.291 --> 29:27.250
that Cooper,

29:27.291 --> 29:30.041
is gonna be looking at me

29:30.083 --> 29:32.000
the way you're
looking at me now,

29:33.333 --> 29:37.458
please, do not help me.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.000
I'm gonna...

29:44.083 --> 29:46.000
I'm sorry.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.083
I'll go.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.250
Let's do something
about your pain.

30:13.291 --> 30:17.125
You know how I feel
about hoodoo.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.667
Where does it hurt most?

30:19.709 --> 30:21.500
My soul.

30:27.667 --> 30:31.041
My hand.

30:31.083 --> 30:32.250
And my face.

30:34.083 --> 30:38.709
Okay.
Then I'll start there. Sheila.

30:38.750 --> 30:42.208
SHELDON:
I understand you don't wanna
discuss the blood.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.500
I don't. You can't make me.

30:45.542 --> 30:47.125
Would you mind if I talked
to your girlfriend?

30:47.166 --> 30:48.750
Maybe called her?
No, you can't do that.

30:48.792 --> 30:50.792
How come?

30:53.083 --> 30:56.166
( mumbles ):
Emasculating bitch.
Always trying to--

30:56.208 --> 30:57.750
Emasculating bitch.

30:57.792 --> 30:59.000
( mutters indistinctly )

30:59.041 --> 31:01.041
How come, Lee?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.667
It wasn't just about
the cheating, was it?

31:02.709 --> 31:05.041
She's an emasculating bitch!

31:05.083 --> 31:06.875
Lee, what did you do
to your girlfriend?

31:06.917 --> 31:08.417
I didn't do anything.
If she's hurt--

31:08.458 --> 31:10.458
I didn't do anything.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.000
Not to her.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.667
Then whose blood is it?

31:20.083 --> 31:23.000
Not hers.

31:36.667 --> 31:39.000
Turn the cameras back on.

31:53.333 --> 31:56.000
Pete helped her with her pain.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.500
Cooper's in there with her now.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.542
You should see if she'll talk
to someone. A psychiatrist.

32:01.583 --> 32:04.667
Mm, I gotta be honest,
I don't wanna go in there.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.709
It's kind of like Nam for me.

32:09.750 --> 32:13.709
Right now, Charlotte
is Vietnam and I'm a vet.

32:13.750 --> 32:16.875
The war rages on.

32:16.917 --> 32:20.542
Can you believe this happened
to someone we know?

32:20.583 --> 32:22.583
Again?

32:23.792 --> 32:26.208
I think we're cursed.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.250
( sighs )

32:28.291 --> 32:31.041
When I became a doctor,

32:31.083 --> 32:34.208
I thought it would all be
fat babies and happy moms.

32:34.250 --> 32:38.041
Thought I was gonna be able
to help people.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.709
Not this. Not any of this.
We help people.

32:40.750 --> 32:44.208
Yeah, but what's the point when
we can't even help ourselves?

32:45.583 --> 32:48.709
Hey. There you are, Addie.

32:48.750 --> 32:49.875
( Amelia grunts )

32:49.917 --> 32:52.458
Do either of you guys want
a bag of over-processed,

32:52.500 --> 32:55.041
partially dehydrogenated crap?
No thanks.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.333
I'm good.
What time is it?

32:56.375 --> 32:59.041
Four a.m.
Ugh.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.834
I've got surgery
tomorrow morning.

33:01.875 --> 33:05.083
Do you think--? Is it rude
if I leave and go home?

33:05.125 --> 33:07.125
What's the etiquette?
What?

33:07.166 --> 33:09.041
I wanna stay, but--

33:09.083 --> 33:11.458
I mean, I don't think anybody
would mind if I went home.

33:11.500 --> 33:15.500
Oh, you--? You wanna go home,
Sam? Fine. Go. Go.

33:15.542 --> 33:18.500
Go rest your head on a pillow.
Sleep the sleep of angels.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.041
AMELIA: He's saying he's tired.
I know what he's saying.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.583
He's saying it doesn't matter
what happened to someone else

33:23.625 --> 33:25.583
because it didn't happen to him,
so he's good, he's out.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.041
What's going on with you?

33:27.083 --> 33:29.166
Sit down. You're tired.

33:33.458 --> 33:35.959
Nothing. I...

33:36.000 --> 33:37.083
( sighs )

33:37.125 --> 33:39.041
You're right, I'm tired.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.625
We're all tired.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.291
It's nothing.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.667
I'll go.
No. I will.

33:54.709 --> 33:55.875
Yuck.

33:59.792 --> 34:02.875
I need to write a memo.

34:02.917 --> 34:04.125
What?

34:04.166 --> 34:06.041
A doctor was attacked
on hospital grounds.

34:06.083 --> 34:08.417
People are gonna be concerned
for their safety.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.625
Someone else can do that.
I'm chief of staff.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.750
You don't have to worry
about it right now.

34:12.792 --> 34:15.667
I'm chief of staff. Of course
I have to worry about it.

34:15.709 --> 34:16.750
Everyone will understand.

34:16.792 --> 34:18.041
I don't want them to understand.

34:18.083 --> 34:20.500
I'm the boss.
You're the victim--

34:23.250 --> 34:25.667
You ever call me the victim
again, this marriage is off.

34:25.709 --> 34:27.458
You hear me?
Okay.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.959
Off.
Okay.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.709
( sighs )

34:41.083 --> 34:42.458
( grunts )

34:45.625 --> 34:47.709
I'm sorry.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.542
It's okay.

34:53.417 --> 34:56.041
Where you going, Cooper?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.125
I'm just walking.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.291
Coop, where you going?

34:59.333 --> 35:01.041
You shouldn't.
I am.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.208
You don't need to see it.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.500
Yeah, I do, actually.

35:05.542 --> 35:06.917
Cooper.
Shut up, Violet.

35:06.959 --> 35:09.250
Cooper--
Stop talking.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.917
( sighs )

35:31.542 --> 35:33.875
She fought. She fought him.

35:33.917 --> 35:37.291
She's 90 pounds soaking wet,
but she's a fighter.

35:41.709 --> 35:44.000
( crying )

36:02.542 --> 36:05.041
SHELDON:
Whose blood is it? Was someone
else an emasculating bitch?

36:05.083 --> 36:06.792
Someone that looked like
your girlfriend?

36:06.834 --> 36:08.625
I mean, come on, Lee,

36:08.667 --> 36:11.125
in the end,
they're all bitches, right?

36:12.792 --> 36:14.208
She told me to wait my turn.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.000
Who?

36:16.041 --> 36:19.583
I just wanted some help
and she told me to--

36:19.625 --> 36:21.709
She wasn't nice.

36:21.750 --> 36:22.917
She had it coming.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.208
Yeah, of course she did.
She had it coming!

36:25.250 --> 36:26.750
What did you do to her?

36:29.583 --> 36:31.542
I hit her.

36:32.583 --> 36:35.166
I hit her hard and she fought.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.458
She was a bitch in heat
and she fought.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.041
( chuckles )

36:39.083 --> 36:40.500
But I gave it to her.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.583
I gave it to her so good.

36:48.709 --> 36:50.625
Who'd you give it to, Lee?

36:53.041 --> 36:55.417
( grunts )

36:55.458 --> 36:56.875
( Sheldon grunting )

36:56.917 --> 36:59.166
They're all the same. You hear
me? They're all the same.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.542
( in strangled voice ): Guard!
They're all the same.

37:01.583 --> 37:03.667
Get him off of him. Get him off.

37:03.709 --> 37:05.875
LEE: They're all the same.
PRICE: Get him off of him.

37:05.917 --> 37:08.667
( Sheldon gasping )

37:08.709 --> 37:11.709
( coughing )

37:29.834 --> 37:31.875
I can wait.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.542
I'll wait it out.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.041
I love you.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.750
I can't tell you.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.792
Are you breaking up with me?

37:47.083 --> 37:50.000
( laughing )

37:53.375 --> 37:55.041
That's funny?

37:55.083 --> 37:56.709
No.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.750
( laughing )

38:00.208 --> 38:02.917
Oh, my God.
I needed that.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.291
Sam, I love you.
You know that, right?

38:05.333 --> 38:06.709
Well, I do now.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.709
What is it
you're not telling me?

38:09.750 --> 38:11.041
I can't.
Talk to me.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.500
If I start talking,

38:12.542 --> 38:14.417
then I'm not gonna be able
to stop, and this--

38:14.458 --> 38:16.375
This is not something
I can talk to you about.

38:16.417 --> 38:18.041
I need you to trust me.
Do you trust me?

38:18.083 --> 38:21.750
Yes, I trust you.
Then, please, don't ask. Just...

38:23.083 --> 38:25.542
Tell me everything
is gonna be okay.

38:25.583 --> 38:28.875
Everything is gonna be okay.

38:28.917 --> 38:30.375
Just be here.

38:30.417 --> 38:33.000
Don't leave me alone.
Okay.

38:48.208 --> 38:49.542
( door opens )

38:51.542 --> 38:54.041
You should be in bed.
Help me get these on.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.375
You don't need
to put them on--

38:55.417 --> 38:57.709
My ass is swinging in the wind.
Help me.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.542
( sighs )

38:59.583 --> 39:02.375
Fine.

39:02.417 --> 39:03.792
( grunting )

39:03.834 --> 39:05.458
I'll do it,
I'll do it, I'll do it.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.000
Untie this gown.

39:16.959 --> 39:18.208
Get me in that shirt.

39:19.458 --> 39:23.041
Charlotte--
I wanna go home.

39:23.083 --> 39:26.041
Please.

39:26.083 --> 39:29.000
I don't wanna
be in this hospital.

39:31.291 --> 39:34.208
( crying )

39:44.083 --> 39:45.792
COOPER:
Okay, okay.

39:51.083 --> 39:53.000
CHARLOTTE:
Thank you.

39:57.667 --> 39:59.750
Look at me.

40:04.625 --> 40:06.250
Thank you.

40:08.333 --> 40:09.875
For loving me.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.250
Take me home.

40:16.500 --> 40:20.041
( Sheldon coughing )

40:20.083 --> 40:21.333
Thanks.

40:25.083 --> 40:31.417
So was he telling the truth,
or was he, you know, crazy?

40:31.458 --> 40:33.041
Both.
Oh.

40:33.083 --> 40:34.208
Are you gonna hold him?

40:34.250 --> 40:37.625
Well, we could arraign him
on assault.

40:37.667 --> 40:40.333
I mean, he kicked a cop,
he attacked you.

40:40.375 --> 40:43.041
If he makes bail, even if you
say to hold him on a psych eval,

40:43.083 --> 40:44.458
he'll be out on the street
in 72 hours.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.917
He raped someone.
Yeah.

40:46.959 --> 40:48.458
There's a woman out there
that he raped.

40:48.500 --> 40:52.041
We can put his DNA in the
system, but there's no victim.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.125
I mean, to hold him,
to charge him,

40:54.166 --> 40:56.041
someone's gotta
file charges.

40:56.083 --> 40:57.333
We gotta get a case.

40:57.375 --> 41:00.875
Joe, the man's a rapist.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.125
Ain't life a bitch, Shelly?

41:04.166 --> 41:06.542
( peaceful classical music
playing )

41:08.709 --> 41:09.959
( door opens )

41:15.208 --> 41:16.583
PETE:
We should get you a wheelchair.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.125
I'll walk out of here
on my own steam

41:18.166 --> 41:20.000
unless I'm in a body bag
or a coma.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.208
( thud then Charlotte grunts )

41:27.083 --> 41:29.166
( grunting )

41:32.083 --> 41:34.333
CHARLOTTE:
No!

41:34.375 --> 41:35.792
( table clatters )

41:37.083 --> 41:38.750
( Lee &amp; Charlotte grunt )

41:39.625 --> 41:41.458
( Charlotte panting )

41:43.625 --> 41:45.041
( Charlotte screams )

41:47.375 --> 41:49.166
Don't you people have
somewhere to be?

42:00.083 --> 42:02.041
Don't let me fall.
I won't.

42:04.625 --> 42:07.041
No.

42:07.083 --> 42:10.583
( screaming )

42:10.625 --> 42:11.750
No!

42:11.792 --> 42:14.458
( Charlotte screaming )

42:16.417 --> 42:17.667
( Lee grunts )

42:17.709 --> 42:19.959
( Charlotte screams )

42:20.000 --> 42:21.834
( thud )

42:25.792 --> 42:27.792
( upbeat theme playing )
