[newscaster on TV]
...a dark and stormy Halloween.

[news jingle plays on TV]

15
00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.422
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.

16
00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:10.049
Our top story tonight,

17
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.468
just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

18
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:16.388
and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.

19
00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:17.973
Things certainly got hot last night

20
00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:21.519
in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.

21
00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:25.648
Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

22
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:27.483
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

23
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.319
Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall

24
00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:31.862
and the safety net
for those who need it.

25
00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:36.117
The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.

26
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.994
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

27
00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:40.454
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

28
00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:41.455
Now wait... Now hang on.

29
00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.791
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

30
00:02:43.874 --> 00:02:44.917
Under my administration,

31
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.796
the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.

32
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.383
The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.

33
00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.760
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

34
00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:55.803
It's gotten worse.

35
00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.179
I'm not saying there isn't work to do.

36
00:02:57.263 --> 00:02:58.222
- But listen...
- [phone rings]

37
00:02:58.305 --> 00:02:59.723

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:10.943

Why is she still tied?

45
00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:25.416
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

46
00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:34.925
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

47
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.886
Just call me in the morning, okay?

49
00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:42.516
[Don on TV] ...who still believes in
everything this city can do.

50
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.144
[Bella] We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.

51
00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:47.897
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

52

[Bruce] We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

88
00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:30.828
But when that light hits the sky,

89
00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:33.706
it's not just a call.

90
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.834
It's a warning.

Are you kidding me, sir?

147
00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:41.597
You're gonna let him in here?

00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:31.355
Sorry, Lieutenant.

154
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.736
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

155
00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:40.656
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

156
00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:45.453
All this blood is from his head?

No.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.460
Excuse me.

159
00:13:54.754 --> 00:13:56.630
Most of it's from his hand.

160
00:14:02.094 --> 00:14:03.137
Thumb was severed.

161
00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:06.974
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

He was alive when it was cut off.

said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

167
00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:37.713
The mayor was up here alone.

168
00:14:40.132 --> 00:14:42.843

through the skylight.

What does a liar do when he's dead?"

175
00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:18.337
There's a cipher too.

176

Any of this mean anything to you?

177
00:15:29.515 --> 00:15:30.724
What's going on here?

178
00:15:33.811 --> 00:15:35.229

[Pete] This is a crime scene.

180

It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

I got the press downstairs.

182
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:44.321
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

183
00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:46.240
But this is way over the line.

184
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.995
Wait.

185
00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:52.788
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

186
00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:53.998
How do you know?

187
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:57.084
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

188
00:15:57.168 --> 00:15:58.919
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

189
00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:00.629
[Gordon] I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

190
00:16:00.713 --> 00:16:02.256
He lies still.

191
00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:04.759
Excuse me?

192
00:16:06.302 --> 00:16:07.386
The riddle.

193
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.390
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

194
00:16:20.524 --> 00:16:22.026
Oh, Jesus.

195
00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.074
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

196
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:30.910
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

197
00:16:31.702 --> 00:16:33.329
[Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.

198
00:16:34.413 --> 00:16:36.082
They're ready for your statement.

199
00:16:40.127 --> 00:16:41.837
I want him outta here.

200
00:16:42.463 --> 00:16:43.547
Now!

201
00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:51.347
Come on.

202
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:56.769
[camera shutter clicking]

203
00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:05.361
Yeah.

204
00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:08.030
The kid found him.

205
00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:16.038
[detective] Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

206
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.374
[melancholy song playing]

207
00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:34.640
We really gotta go, man.

208
00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:43.941
[Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.

209
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.235
A wife lost a husband.

210
00:17:47.445 --> 00:17:48.988
And I lost a friend.

211
00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:52.616
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

212
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.786
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

213
00:17:56.245 --> 00:17:58.414
This was a truly senseless crime,

214
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.585
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have

215
00:18:02.668 --> 00:18:06.756
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.

216
00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:08.090
I've spoken to the governor...

217
00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:11.010
[Bruce] I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

218
00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:12.678
but I don't know.

219
00:18:13.095 --> 00:18:15.431
[melancholy song continues]

220
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:21.479
Murder, robberies, assault.

221
00:18:21.562 --> 00:18:23.647
Two years later, they're all up.

222
00:18:24.398 --> 00:18:25.733
And now this.

223
00:18:27.902 --> 00:18:29.487
The city's eating itself.

224
00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:33.449
Maybe it's beyond saving.

225
00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:37.828
But I have to try.

226
00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:39.872
Push myself.

227
00:18:40.164 --> 00:18:42.333
[melancholy song continues]

228
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.433
[engine revving]

229
00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:12.571
[bats chittering]

230
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.462
These nights all roll together in a rush

231
00:19:29.422 --> 00:19:31.340
behind the mask.

232
00:19:35.845 --> 00:19:38.139
Sometimes in the morning,

233
00:19:39.932 --> 00:19:42.101
I have to force myself to remember

234
00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:46.063
everything that happened.

235
00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:48.441
[groaning]

236
00:20:00.619 --> 00:20:02.204
[newscaster on TV] Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.

237
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:06.167
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

238
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.086
was found murdered last night
inside his home

239
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.921
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

240
00:20:11.005 --> 00:20:12.673
[newscaster 2]
Exact details of the crime

241
00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:14.258
still have not been released,

242
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:17.219
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

243
00:20:17.303 --> 00:20:20.556
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

244
00:20:20.681 --> 00:20:22.475
And this certainly is not the first time

245
00:20:22.558 --> 00:20:25.102
Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.

246
00:20:25.186 --> 00:20:29.440
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week

247
00:20:29.523 --> 00:20:31.275
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

248
00:20:31.358 --> 00:20:33.319
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

249
00:20:33.402 --> 00:20:36.238
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

250
00:20:36.322 --> 00:20:40.159
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.

251
00:20:40.242 --> 00:20:42.036
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career

252
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:44.789
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

253
00:20:44.872 --> 00:20:48.125
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,

254
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:52.171
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni

255
00:20:52.254 --> 00:20:56.425
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

256
00:20:56.509 --> 00:20:57.927
I assume you heard about this.

257
00:20:58.177 --> 00:20:59.637
[newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]

258
00:20:59.804 --> 00:21:01.055
- Yeah.
- [video fast-forwarding]

259
00:21:08.062 --> 00:21:09.396
Oh, I see.

260
00:21:10.231 --> 00:21:12.149
[Gordon on video]
All this blood is from his head?

261
00:21:12.691 --> 00:21:13.901
Dear God.

262
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.703
[lead detective] There's a cipher too.

263
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:35.005
[Gordon]
Any of this mean anything to you?

264
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.425
[camera shutter clicking]

265
00:21:38.175 --> 00:21:39.969
The killer left this for the Batman?

266
00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:43.055
[Gordon]
I asked him to come, Pete.

267
00:21:43.139 --> 00:21:44.140
Apparently.

268
00:21:44.432 --> 00:21:46.308
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

269
00:21:48.352 --> 00:21:49.687
Why is he writing to you?

270
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.188
[Pete]
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

271
00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:52.314
I don't know yet.

272
00:21:52.398 --> 00:21:53.941
[Pete] I got the press downstairs.

273
00:21:55.818 --> 00:21:57.236
Have a shower.

274
00:21:58.696 --> 00:22:00.364
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

275
00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:01.365
are coming for breakfast.

276
00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:03.451
Here? Why?

277
00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:04.618
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

278
00:22:04.702 --> 00:22:05.786
I haven't got time for this.

279
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.538
It's getting serious, Bruce.

280
00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:10.708
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

281
00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:12.376
I don't care about that.

282
00:22:13.294 --> 00:22:14.170
Any of that.

283
00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:15.755
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

284
00:22:18.132 --> 00:22:21.260
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

285
00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:23.512
If I can't change things here,

286
00:22:24.054 --> 00:22:25.973
if I can't have an effect,

287
00:22:27.057 --> 00:22:28.684
then I don't care what happens to me.

288
00:22:28.768 --> 00:22:29.894
That's what I'm afraid of.

289
00:22:29.977 --> 00:22:31.604
Alfred, stop.

290
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.440
You're not my father.

291
00:22:37.234 --> 00:22:38.652
I'm well aware.

00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:15.231
[Gordon on video]
We really gotta go, man.

00:23:24.156 --> 00:23:26.158
[soft classical music playing]

296
00:23:40.881 --> 00:23:42.466
Some fresh berries there.

297
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.766
What are you doing?

298
00:23:51.142 --> 00:23:54.812
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

299
00:23:55.187 --> 00:23:59.108
[inhales sharply]
This is actually quite elusive.

300
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:03.779
Where'd you get those O's?

301
00:24:03.904 --> 00:24:05.239
[Alfred smacks lips]

302
00:24:05.322 --> 00:24:08.117
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

303
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.619
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

304
00:24:10.703 --> 00:24:14.749
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

305
00:24:14.832 --> 00:24:16.208
see where it leads.

306
00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:19.128
That's interesting.

307
00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:21.505
[woman] Mr. Pennyworth?

308
00:24:21.881 --> 00:24:22.882
Yes, Dory?

309
00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:24.675
The accountants are here.

310
00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.594
See them in, please, Dory.

311
00:24:29.513 --> 00:24:31.724
[Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?

312
00:24:31.807 --> 00:24:33.392
What do you mean?

313
00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:35.311
What if this is the whole key?

314
00:24:36.228 --> 00:24:38.773
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

315
00:24:38.856 --> 00:24:40.900
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

316
00:24:40.983 --> 00:24:42.151
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

317
00:24:42.234 --> 00:24:44.361
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

318
00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:46.280
I don't see how that's gonna...

319
00:24:46.864 --> 00:24:48.657
[suspenseful music playing]

320
00:24:48.824 --> 00:24:49.825
Oh.

321
00:25:03.631 --> 00:25:05.299
[Gordon] Damn.

322
00:25:05.466 --> 00:25:07.718
Yeah, he's got a car.

323
00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:11.013
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

324
00:25:11.097 --> 00:25:12.765
Where to even start?

325
00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:15.684
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

326
00:25:15.768 --> 00:25:16.769
[Batman] You don't trust me?

327
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.396
You mean like you trust me?

328
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.358
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

[air hissing]

332
00:25:48.592 --> 00:25:49.885
What are we looking for?

333
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.054
A USB port.

334
00:25:52.138 --> 00:25:53.264

Oh, well, well, well.

344
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:44.940
So much for family values.

345
00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:46.275
Who is she?

346
00:26:46.358 --> 00:26:47.943
No idea.

347
00:26:48.861 --> 00:26:51.697
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

348
00:26:52.031 --> 00:26:53.532
- I know who he is.
- [notification whooshing]

349
00:26:53.991 --> 00:26:54.992
What was that?

00:26:56.744 --> 00:26:59.580
Shit, shit! The drive.

351
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:02.666
It sent out the photos from my account.

352
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.294
Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.

353
00:27:05.377 --> 00:27:07.463
Jesus.

354
00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:09.924
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

"He lies still."

356
00:27:11.675 --> 00:27:12.718
About her?

357
00:27:13.969 --> 00:27:15.554
Maybe.

358
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:17.598
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

359
00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:21.102
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

360
00:27:21.185 --> 00:27:23.312

[cat meowing]

542
00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:24.361
You got a lot of cats.

543
00:41:25.863 --> 00:41:27.782
I have a thing about strays.

544
00:41:28.324 --> 00:41:30.201
[gentle music playing]

545
00:41:31.911 --> 00:41:33.245
You're not safe here.

546
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:35.539
I can take care of myself.

547
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:38.417
[newscaster] Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,

548
00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:40.044
and only days before the election.

549
00:41:40.127 --> 00:41:43.380
Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer

550
00:41:43.464 --> 00:41:46.300
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

551
00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:07.488
He waited for him at the gym.

552
00:42:08.614 --> 00:42:10.658
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

553
00:42:10.741 --> 00:42:12.868
when no one else was around.

554
00:42:13.994 --> 00:42:15.413
There's a needle mark on his neck.

555
00:42:15.496 --> 00:42:17.456
Injected him with arsenic.

556
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:20.793
Rat poison.

557
00:42:21.585 --> 00:42:23.170
Yeah.

558
00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:25.798
That seems to be his theme here.

559
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.716
Look at this thing.

[eerie music playing]

561
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.601
It's a maze.

[flashlight clicks]

563
00:42:40.187 --> 00:42:43.482
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

564
00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:47.319
[Batman] More symbols.

565
00:42:49.822 --> 00:42:51.407
It's another cipher.

566
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.243
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

567
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.496
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

568
00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.708
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

569
00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:03.627
I don't get it.

570
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:06.088
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

571
00:43:07.006 --> 00:43:09.008
Looks like he got greedy.

572
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:10.134
You kidding me?

573
00:43:10.217 --> 00:43:12.928
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

574
00:43:13.012 --> 00:43:16.265
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

575
00:43:16.348 --> 00:43:18.559
Maybe he's not who you thought.

576
00:43:20.102 --> 00:43:22.146
You make it sound like he had it coming.

577
00:43:24.398 --> 00:43:25.858
He was a cop.

578
00:43:27.193 --> 00:43:28.486
Crossed a line.

579
00:43:47.963 --> 00:43:49.090

585
00:44:19.203 --> 00:44:20.913
The hell is that?

586
00:44:21.664 --> 00:44:24.834
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

587
00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.461
I don't know.

588
00:44:28.337 --> 00:44:29.505
[Martinez] Lieutenant.

589
00:44:29.588 --> 00:44:31.006
They're coming back.

590
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.341
[Gordon] We got to get out of here.

[eerie music continues]

592
00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:37.638
Come on.

593
00:44:42.726 --> 00:44:43.769
[Selina] Ow!

594
00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:46.564
I don't know about these things.

595
00:44:46.647 --> 00:44:50.109
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

596
00:44:54.113 --> 00:44:56.699
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

597
00:44:58.576 --> 00:45:00.035
I'm just looking for Annika.

598
00:45:04.331 --> 00:45:05.958
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

599
00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:09.712
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

[gentle music playing]

Looks good. Here.

Yeah.

Hey, where you goin'?

[Batman] That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.

"Kenzie, William."

He's an off-duty cop.

Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

620

Don't worry. I'm watching you.

These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

'Cause when I first saw you,

632
00:47:38.277 --> 00:47:39.487
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

633
00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.822
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

634
00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:44.200
Can we not do this right now?

635
00:47:46.118 --> 00:47:47.661

If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

Yeah.

Wow. [chuckles] I've seen you on TV.

651
00:48:22.488 --> 00:48:23.864
Is that right?

652
00:48:24.281 --> 00:48:26.492
I haven't seen you around here before.

653
00:48:27.493 --> 00:48:29.537
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

654
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.164
'cause people are all a little on edge.

655

[Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.

00:48:33.833 --> 00:48:34.834
- [Gil] Is that right?
- [Selina chuckles]

657
00:48:35.126 --> 00:48:36.335
[Gil chuckles] I like that.

658
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.753
Do you want to come over?

659
00:48:37.837 --> 00:48:38.963
Sure.

660
00:48:41.966 --> 00:48:43.300
- [Gil] This is Travis.
- Hey.

661
00:48:43.384 --> 00:48:44.802
[Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?

662
00:48:45.094 --> 00:48:46.971
- Richie, Glen.
- [Richie] Hey.

663
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:49.932
That's half the DA's office.

664
00:48:50.015 --> 00:48:51.183
[Gil] You know Carla here, huh?

665
00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:52.226
Hi.

666
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:54.353
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

667
00:48:54.437 --> 00:48:56.313
Drowning our sorrows.

668
00:48:56.647 --> 00:48:57.940
You want a drop?

669
00:48:58.023 --> 00:49:00.067
[Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

Hope you don't mind.

672
00:49:03.779 --> 00:49:05.823
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.

673
00:49:06.282 --> 00:49:07.241
He's wasted.

674
00:49:07.324 --> 00:49:08.367
No shit.

675
00:49:10.035 --> 00:49:11.036
[chuckles] I like this girl.

676
00:49:11.495 --> 00:49:13.080
Oh, hey, I like you too!

677
00:49:16.625 --> 00:49:19.962
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.

678
00:49:20.045 --> 00:49:21.130
He knows so much.

679
00:49:21.213 --> 00:49:22.506
[Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.

680
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.842
[Gil] What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

681
00:49:24.925 --> 00:49:25.843
[Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

682
00:49:25.926 --> 00:49:27.845
- Think maybe you had a little too much.
- Hey. The rat.

683
00:49:27.928 --> 00:49:29.889
- [Richie] Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.

684
00:49:31.891 --> 00:49:33.726
[Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?

685
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:38.606
[inhales deeply]

686
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.279
I mean...

687
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:49.700
there was a rat. We had an informant.

688
00:49:50.284 --> 00:49:52.703
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

689
00:49:52.787 --> 00:49:54.497
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

690
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.165
He's talking about the Maroni case.

691
00:49:56.248 --> 00:49:59.543
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

692
00:50:00.127 --> 00:50:02.421
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.

693
00:50:02.505 --> 00:50:04.423
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

694
00:50:04.507 --> 00:50:07.134
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

695
00:50:07.218 --> 00:50:08.469
What do you know about that?

696
00:50:10.096 --> 00:50:11.263
Does anybody want a drink?

697
00:50:11.347 --> 00:50:12.306
[Gil] I want a drink.

698
00:50:12.473 --> 00:50:13.724
Keep him talking.

699
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:17.895
Wait, where are you going?

700
00:50:17.978 --> 00:50:19.021
She knows Annika.

701
00:50:19.105 --> 00:50:20.523
No, stay on the DA.

702
00:50:20.606 --> 00:50:22.525
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

703
00:50:24.652 --> 00:50:26.779
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

704
00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:27.905
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

705
00:50:27.988 --> 00:50:30.533
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.

706
00:50:30.616 --> 00:50:31.867
What, you got a death wish?

707
00:50:31.951 --> 00:50:34.412
[man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

708
00:50:34.495 --> 00:50:37.415
[Carla]
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

709
00:50:37.498 --> 00:50:38.999
Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?

710
00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:40.167
[Carla] Sure thing, Oz.

711
00:50:44.922 --> 00:50:45.965
Hey.

712
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:47.633
Hey.

713
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:51.971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

714
00:50:53.264 --> 00:50:54.473
How you been?

715
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:58.519
Yeah, I've been okay.

716
00:50:59.854 --> 00:51:01.230
I was just...

717
00:51:03.274 --> 00:51:05.109
I was just headed back upstairs.

718
00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.861
Well...

719
00:51:07.945 --> 00:51:09.613
don't be a stranger.

720
00:51:23.711 --> 00:51:26.088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

721
00:51:26.172 --> 00:51:27.757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

722
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.633
I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?

723
00:51:29.717 --> 00:51:31.552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- Forget it.

724
00:51:31.635 --> 00:51:32.720
Wait, what are you doing?

725
00:51:32.803 --> 00:51:35.222
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No! No!

726
00:51:35.347 --> 00:51:36.891
[line breaking up]

727
00:51:37.308 --> 00:51:38.476
[static buzzes, stream stops]

728
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.811
[Selina] Taxi!

729
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:42.563
[heavy breathing]

730
00:51:44.774 --> 00:51:45.775
[Gil] Hey!

731
00:51:47.485 --> 00:51:48.569
I lost you in there.

732
00:51:48.652 --> 00:51:49.737
Yeah, I gotta go.

733
00:51:50.613 --> 00:51:52.031
Oh, you need a ride?

734
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.033
That's me right there.

735
00:51:54.325 --> 00:51:56.285
[eerie music playing]

736
00:52:00.122 --> 00:52:01.207
Taxi!

737
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:02.416
I'm good.

738
00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:05.544
I hope, uh...

739
00:52:10.132 --> 00:52:11.550
I'll see you around.

740
00:52:11.634 --> 00:52:12.760
[car door closes]

741
00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:17.389

- [Gil grunts]
- [Riddler shushes]

752
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.016
Just hold still.

753
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.685
- [beeping]
- [Gil whimpers]

754
00:53:47.104 --> 00:53:49.356
[Riddler breathing heavily and raspily]

755
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.443

[switch clicks]

758
00:54:40.366 --> 00:54:41.283
[Batman] What do you know about

759
00:54:41.367 --> 00:54:43.661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

760
00:54:46.747 --> 00:54:48.457
Yeah, sure, there was.

761
00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:51.001
That's the rat we're looking for.

762
00:54:51.919 --> 00:54:53.796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

763
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:57.383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

764
00:54:57.466 --> 00:54:58.926
Where are you getting this?

765
00:54:59.009 --> 00:55:01.887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

766
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.140
Gil's very nervous.

767
00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:07.643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

768
00:55:07.726 --> 00:55:09.603
I worked that case.

769
00:55:09.687 --> 00:55:11.647
Riddler's not after you.

770
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:12.648
How do you know?

771
00:55:13.023 --> 00:55:14.442
You're not corrupt.

772
00:55:15.484 --> 00:55:17.027
Colson's dirty?

773
00:55:22.908 --> 00:55:24.410
Maybe I, uh...

774
00:55:25.077 --> 00:55:28.414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

775
00:55:28.497 --> 00:55:31.792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

776
00:55:32.543 --> 00:55:34.336
Who knows how many people it touches.

777
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

778
00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:40.634
It could tear the whole city apart.

779
00:55:41.051 --> 00:55:43.095
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

780
00:55:44.722 --> 00:55:46.474
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

781
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:48.517
[Batman on video]
You know Carmine Falcone.

782
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:49.894
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

783
00:55:49.977 --> 00:55:51.395
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

784
00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:52.980
[Selina] I don't have a relationship...

785
00:55:53.063 --> 00:55:53.939
[video rewinds]

786
00:55:54.023 --> 00:55:55.608
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

787
00:55:55.691 --> 00:55:57.359
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

788
00:55:57.485 --> 00:55:58.402
[video rewinds]

789
00:55:58.486 --> 00:55:59.945
[Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.

790
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:01.072
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

791
00:56:01.155 --> 00:56:02.782
[Batman] You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

792
00:56:02.865 --> 00:56:04.700
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

793
00:56:04.784 --> 00:56:06.035
- [Alfred] Pretty.
- [tape clicks off]

794
00:56:08.037 --> 00:56:09.413
She a new friend of yours?

795
00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:15.211
I'm not so sure.

796
00:56:16.045 --> 00:56:17.546
Looks like you upset her.

797
00:56:18.714 --> 00:56:20.841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

798
00:56:20.925 --> 00:56:21.926
What?

799
00:56:22.009 --> 00:56:22.927
Your attire.

800
00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

801
00:56:25.221 --> 00:56:27.223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

802
00:56:27.306 --> 00:56:29.975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

803
00:56:31.018 --> 00:56:32.603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

804
00:56:32.686 --> 00:56:34.146
Oh, that reminds me.

805
00:56:35.314 --> 00:56:39.276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

806
00:56:39.819 --> 00:56:41.320
The one from the rat maze.

807
00:56:41.737 --> 00:56:44.824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

808
00:56:45.157 --> 00:56:47.034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

809
00:56:47.118 --> 00:56:50.371
"You are El Rata Alada."

810
00:56:50.996 --> 00:56:52.415
[Bruce] Rata Alada?

811
00:56:52.498 --> 00:56:53.707
"Rat with wings"?

812
00:56:53.791 --> 00:56:56.293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

813
00:56:56.377 --> 00:56:57.628
Yeah.

814
00:56:59.088 --> 00:57:00.214
A stool pigeon.

815
00:57:00.464 --> 00:57:02.091
Where are your cufflinks?

816
00:57:02.174 --> 00:57:03.134
I couldn't find them.

817
00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:06.554
Well, you can't go out like that.

818
00:57:06.637 --> 00:57:08.431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

819
00:57:12.601 --> 00:57:15.396
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

820
00:57:15.479 --> 00:57:16.480
[scoffs]

821
00:57:17.106 --> 00:57:19.316
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

822
00:57:20.317 --> 00:57:22.111
Your father gave them to me.

823
00:57:24.947 --> 00:57:26.615
[gentle music playing]

824
00:57:27.867 --> 00:57:30.995
[protesters chanting]
No more lies! No more lies!

825
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.141
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

826
00:57:56.145 --> 00:57:57.438
[melancholy music playing]

827
00:57:58.439 --> 00:58:00.566
[protesters continue chanting]

828
00:58:04.695 --> 00:58:06.447
[reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?

829
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.158
[reporters] Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

- [camera shutters clicking]

831

You good, fellas?

833
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:23.422
Good.

834
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:26.634
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

835
00:58:27.176 --> 00:58:29.220
[melancholy music continues]

836
00:58:44.443 --> 00:58:45.444
Sir?

837
00:58:45.778 --> 00:58:47.321
[reporters continue clamoring]

838
00:59:05.131 --> 00:59:06.090
[bodyguard] Hey!

839
00:59:06.173 --> 00:59:08.175
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

840
00:59:09.135 --> 00:59:10.970
Hey, watch it, fellas.

841
00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:13.722
You got the prince of the city there.

842
00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.394
Some event, huh?

843
00:59:18.477 --> 00:59:21.439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

844
00:59:21.522 --> 00:59:23.983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

845
00:59:24.066 --> 00:59:25.693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

846
00:59:25.776 --> 00:59:27.778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

847
00:59:28.654 --> 00:59:30.072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

848
00:59:30.698 --> 00:59:32.158
Wow. Is that right?

849
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:34.285
His father saved my life.

850
00:59:35.244 --> 00:59:38.456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

851
00:59:39.665 --> 00:59:43.169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

852
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:46.672
Operated right on the dining room table.

853
00:59:46.756 --> 00:59:52.011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

854
00:59:53.429 --> 00:59:55.431
I remember your face.

855
00:59:57.433 --> 00:59:59.393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

856
00:59:59.769 --> 01:00:01.896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

857
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.815
"Hippocratic oath."

858
01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:08.569
That's good.

859
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:10.279
Excuse me.

860
01:00:11.322 --> 01:00:12.823
[laughs]

861
01:00:13.866 --> 01:00:14.700
Yes.

- [heavy breathing]
- [man coughing]

865
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:29.965
[announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,

866
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:31.634
thank you all for
coming to today's memorial

867
01:00:31.717 --> 01:00:34.095
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

868
01:00:34.178 --> 01:00:35.971
Our program will begin shortly.

869
01:00:36.055 --> 01:00:37.473
As a reminder, the family asked that

870
01:00:37.556 --> 01:00:38.974
those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

871
01:00:39.058 --> 01:00:40.476
consider a donation to

872
01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:42.603
- the cause most dear to his heart...
- [scuffling]

873
01:00:42.686 --> 01:00:44.939
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

874
01:00:45.022 --> 01:00:46.232
our city's safety net.

875
01:00:46.607 --> 01:00:49.151
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

876
01:00:50.236 --> 01:00:53.989
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

877
01:00:54.073 --> 01:00:57.284
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

878
01:00:58.285 --> 01:01:00.162
He got what he deserved.

879
01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:03.082
Know what I mean?

880
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:06.502
Hey, don't I know you?

882
01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:10.548
Why haven't you called me back?

883
01:01:10.631 --> 01:01:11.632
I'm sorry?

884
01:01:11.924 --> 01:01:14.260
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

885
01:01:14.343 --> 01:01:15.553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

886
01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:18.305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

887
01:01:18.389 --> 01:01:19.723
Will you walk with me?

01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:23.519
["Ave Maria" continues playing]

01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.230
Mr. Wayne.

890
01:01:26.313 --> 01:01:27.523
Mr. Wayne.

891
01:01:28.232 --> 01:01:31.318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

892
01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:33.738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

893
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:36.240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

894
01:01:36.323 --> 01:01:38.784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

895
01:01:39.368 --> 01:01:40.661
Thank you.

896
01:01:41.537 --> 01:01:42.538
[Bella] My God.

897
01:01:44.373 --> 01:01:46.876
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

898
01:01:46.959 --> 01:01:48.586
I want to continue this.

899
01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:53.674
Excuse me.

900
01:01:55.718 --> 01:01:57.595
I'm so sorry for your loss.

901
01:01:59.805 --> 01:02:00.723
Thank you.

902
01:02:00.806 --> 01:02:02.558
[Gordon] Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

903
01:02:03.893 --> 01:02:05.770
Gil Colson is missing.

904
01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:07.146
[Mackenzie] What?

905
01:02:07.229 --> 01:02:09.523
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

906
01:02:09.607 --> 01:02:10.649
Christ, not again.

907
01:02:10.733 --> 01:02:12.818
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

908
01:02:15.112 --> 01:02:17.156
You got people looking for him, Jim?

909
01:02:17.823 --> 01:02:20.117
[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

910
01:02:20.201 --> 01:02:21.118
[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

911
01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:22.411
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

912
01:02:24.371 --> 01:02:25.790
[people outside screaming]

913
01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.750
[indistinct shouting]

914
01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.629
[tires squeal]

[people clamoring]

921
01:03:02.243 --> 01:03:03.994
[menacing music playing]

922
01:03:17.174 --> 01:03:18.092
[Gordon] Get out of the car!

923
01:03:18.843 --> 01:03:21.053
Get out of the car and show your hands!

924
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:23.681
Get out!

925
01:03:32.815 --> 01:03:34.108
[man in car grunting]

926
01:03:34.191 --> 01:03:35.484
Get 'em up!

927
01:03:35.568 --> 01:03:37.319
Get out! Show 'em!

928
01:03:38.904 --> 01:03:40.030
[panting]

929
01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:43.367
Christ, it's Colson.

930
01:03:43.451 --> 01:03:45.161
[officer]
There's a bomb around his neck!

931
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:50.332
- [cell phone ringing]
- [people gasp]

932
01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:52.334
[whimpering]

933
01:03:53.127 --> 01:03:54.420
[cell phone continues ringing]

934
01:04:00.217 --> 01:04:01.761
Let's clear this place out now!

935
01:04:01.844 --> 01:04:03.471
[officer 2]
We've got to get this place cleared out!

936
01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.389
[people clamoring]

937
01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:07.308
[cell phone continues ringing]

938
01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:18.402
[cell phone ringing]

01:04:18.486 --> 01:04:19.904
[whirring]

940
01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:35.836
- [ringing continues]
- [camera shutter clicks]

941
01:04:37.713 --> 01:04:40.466
[man] Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

942
01:04:40.758 --> 01:04:42.760
[sirens wailing]

943
01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:44.887
[officer]
We don't know if he's in on it.

944
01:04:48.015 --> 01:04:49.350
What's he looking at?

945
01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:51.560
[cell phone ringing]

946
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.897
[distant footsteps]

947
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:00.569
[footsteps coming closer]

948
01:05:00.903 --> 01:05:03.114
[ominous music playing]

949
01:05:08.119 --> 01:05:09.453
Holy shit.

950
01:05:10.496 --> 01:05:12.164
[Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?

951
01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:15.000
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

952
01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:18.295
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

953
01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:21.215
[cell phone continues ringing]

954
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:35.271
Please.

955
01:05:35.438 --> 01:05:38.190
He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

956
01:05:38.607 --> 01:05:40.818
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

957
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:41.902
I'm so sorry.

958
01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:44.071
Looks like a combination lock.

959
01:05:44.155 --> 01:05:45.614
Can't we just cut it off?

960
01:05:46.365 --> 01:05:48.033
Not if you want to keep your head.

961
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:53.247
[cell phone continues ringing]

962
01:06:18.481 --> 01:06:20.357
[Riddler breathing heavily]

963
01:06:24.737 --> 01:06:25.988
[Riddler] You came.

964
01:06:27.823 --> 01:06:28.908
Who are you?

965
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:30.451
Me?

966
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:34.455
I'm nobody.

967
01:06:35.915 --> 01:06:38.334
I'm just an instrument,

968
01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:42.713
here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.

969
01:06:43.255 --> 01:06:44.340
"Unmask"?

970
01:06:44.423 --> 01:06:45.591
Yes.

971
01:06:46.425 --> 01:06:49.261
Let's do it together, okay?

972
01:06:49.345 --> 01:06:51.764
I've been trying to reach you.

973
01:06:52.431 --> 01:06:54.767
You're part of this too.

974
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.644
How am I a part of this?

975
01:06:56.727 --> 01:06:58.646
You'll see.

976
01:06:58.729 --> 01:07:00.481
[officer] Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

977
01:07:00.564 --> 01:07:02.650
[Riddler on stream]
Say hello to my followers.

978
01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:03.984
We're live.

979
01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:07.071
They're here to watch our little trial.

980
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.448
At the moment,

981
01:07:09.532 --> 01:07:12.910
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,

982
01:07:12.993 --> 01:07:14.036
is dead.

983
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.122
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

984
01:07:16.205 --> 01:07:17.164
But wait a minute...

985
01:07:17.248 --> 01:07:20.376
[shouting] Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!

986
01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:23.462
You hear me?

987
01:07:23.546 --> 01:07:24.547
[softly] Okay.

988
01:07:25.089 --> 01:07:26.715
[Riddler groaning comically]

989
01:07:29.176 --> 01:07:30.761
[Riddler laughing]

990
01:07:33.305 --> 01:07:35.391
[Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.

991
01:07:37.143 --> 01:07:39.311
No one ever gave me a chance.

992
01:07:41.355 --> 01:07:42.398
Now,

993
01:07:43.399 --> 01:07:46.193
ever since I was a child,

994
01:07:46.277 --> 01:07:49.864
I've always loved little puzzles.

995
01:07:50.448 --> 01:07:52.867
For me, they are a retreat

996
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:56.287
from the horrors of our world.

997
01:07:56.370 --> 01:08:01.584
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

998
01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.919
- You want me to do puzzles?
- [chuckles excitedly]

999
01:08:04.003 --> 01:08:06.756
Three riddles in two minutes.

1000
01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:10.926
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

1001
01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:13.345
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

1002
01:08:13.429 --> 01:08:15.598
Okay, okay. So I just...

1003
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.766
- You want me to...
- [device beeps]

1004
01:08:16.891 --> 01:08:19.226
- [whimpers]
- Riddle number one...

1005
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.938
- [timer beeping]
- "It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

1006
01:08:23.022 --> 01:08:27.693
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

1007
01:08:27.777 --> 01:08:30.196
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1008
01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.363
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1009
01:08:31.447 --> 01:08:32.865
- "Justice."
- Huh?

1010
01:08:32.948 --> 01:08:33.991
The answer's "justice."

1011
01:08:34.075 --> 01:08:35.284
- Justice?
- Yes!

1012
01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:36.952
- Oh, God.
- Justice!

1013
01:08:37.036 --> 01:08:41.373
[dramatically] And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

1014
01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:43.834
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

1015
01:08:43.918 --> 01:08:46.295
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1016
01:08:46.378 --> 01:08:47.588
Of course, of course. Of course.

1017
01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:50.049
Riddle number two.

1018
01:08:50.132 --> 01:08:54.261
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

1019
01:08:54.345 --> 01:08:58.516
What is the price for your blind eye?"

1020
01:08:58.599 --> 01:09:00.392
- "The price"?
- [Batman] "Bribes."

1021
01:09:00.476 --> 01:09:01.727
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

1022
01:09:01.811 --> 01:09:03.979
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

1023
01:09:04.063 --> 01:09:05.314
[hesitating]

1024
01:09:05.397 --> 01:09:06.524
[shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!

1025
01:09:06.607 --> 01:09:07.858
- How much?
- Nothing!

1026
01:09:07.942 --> 01:09:10.152
- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1027
01:09:10.236 --> 01:09:12.530
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1028
01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:13.447
What cases?

1029
01:09:13.531 --> 01:09:14.657
He didn't ask me that!

1030
01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.741
- Come on! Ten grand.
- [Riddler laughing]

1031
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.161
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1032
01:09:19.245 --> 01:09:21.872
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

1033
01:09:21.956 --> 01:09:25.793
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

1034
01:09:25.876 --> 01:09:28.295
[singsongy] Last riddle.

1035
01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:32.716
[dramatically]
"Since your justice is so select,

1036
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.096
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

1037
01:09:37.179 --> 01:09:39.265
- "Which vermin"?
- [Batman] The rat.

1038
01:09:39.348 --> 01:09:41.892
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

1039
01:09:41.976 --> 01:09:43.769
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

1040
01:09:43.853 --> 01:09:45.062
Twenty seconds.

1041
01:09:45.146 --> 01:09:46.814
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

1042
01:09:46.897 --> 01:09:48.858
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

1043
01:09:48.941 --> 01:09:50.484
If I go out this way, it's just me.

1044
01:09:50.568 --> 01:09:53.696
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

1045
01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.239
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

1046
01:09:55.322 --> 01:09:56.657
- People are watching.
- What people?

1047
01:09:56.741 --> 01:09:58.868
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

1048
01:09:58.951 --> 01:10:01.120
- It's the whole system!
- Five!

1049
01:10:01.203 --> 01:10:02.079
- Four!
- [beeping rapidly]

1050
01:10:02.163 --> 01:10:03.539
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!

1051
01:10:03.622 --> 01:10:05.499
- Goodbye!
- [device trills]

1052
01:10:05.708 --> 01:10:06.584
[Batman grunts]

1053
01:10:08.878 --> 01:10:10.838
[people gasp]

1054
01:10:12.256 --> 01:10:14.008
[ears ringing]

1055
01:10:15.634 --> 01:10:17.219
[muffled, indistinct shouting]

1056
01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:30.566
[ringing intensifies]

1057
01:10:32.777 --> 01:10:33.778
[ringing stops]

1058
01:10:35.696 --> 01:10:37.073
[Martinez]
Who do you think he is under there?

1059
01:10:37.156 --> 01:10:37.990
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1060
01:10:38.074 --> 01:10:39.075
[Martinez] I want to see.

1061
01:10:40.409 --> 01:10:41.619
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1062
01:10:45.372 --> 01:10:46.832
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1063
01:10:46.916 --> 01:10:48.375
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1064
01:10:48.459 --> 01:10:49.668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1065
01:10:49.752 --> 01:10:50.920
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1066
01:10:51.504 --> 01:10:54.632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1067
01:10:54.715 --> 01:10:56.383
Relax, God damn it!

1068
01:10:56.467 --> 01:10:57.968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1069
01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:01.931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1070
01:11:02.014 --> 01:11:04.433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1071
01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:05.935
Maybe it's on yours.

1072
01:11:07.394 --> 01:11:08.437
What'd you say?

1073
01:11:08.521 --> 01:11:10.106
He would rather die than talk.

1074
01:11:10.689 --> 01:11:12.191
What was he afraid of?

1075
01:11:12.942 --> 01:11:14.026
You?

[menacing music playing]

1077
01:11:21.158 --> 01:11:22.576
You son of a bitch.

1078
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1079
01:11:26.247 --> 01:11:27.957
You could be an accessory to murder.

1080
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.041
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1081

[officers clamoring]

1082
01:11:31.168 --> 01:11:32.044
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1083
01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:34.130
Back off! Back off!

1084
01:11:34.213 --> 01:11:36.507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1085
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1086
01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:41.554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1087
01:11:41.929 --> 01:11:43.681
[breathing heavily]

1088
01:11:44.223 --> 01:11:45.766
You too now?

1089
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:48.394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1090
01:11:48.477 --> 01:11:51.063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1091
01:11:51.147 --> 01:11:53.399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1092
01:11:56.193 --> 01:11:57.695
Okay, give him the room.

1093
01:12:13.335 --> 01:12:14.628
Two minutes.

1094
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:27.975
You listen to me.

1095
01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.562
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1096
01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:35.191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1097
01:12:35.274 --> 01:12:36.942
Well, you punched me in the face.

1098
01:12:38.027 --> 01:12:39.111
[Batman scoffs]

1099
01:12:39.195 --> 01:12:40.488
Take this key.

1100
01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:45.159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1101
01:12:46.202 --> 01:12:47.912
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1102
01:12:48.913 --> 01:12:51.207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

[suspenseful music playing]

1104
01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:56.962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1105
01:13:00.382 --> 01:13:03.094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1106
01:13:03.177 --> 01:13:06.097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1107
01:13:07.014 --> 01:13:09.642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1108
01:13:12.353 --> 01:13:14.313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1109
01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:20.403
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1110
01:13:20.486 --> 01:13:21.987
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1119

[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1120
01:14:50.576 --> 01:14:51.786
I did.

1121
01:14:51.869 --> 01:14:55.247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1122
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:57.374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1123
01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:58.584
I only trust you.

1124
01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:01.003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1125
01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:04.465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1126
01:15:05.216 --> 01:15:06.342
You think Penguin's the rat?

1127
01:15:06.425 --> 01:15:09.470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1128
01:15:09.553 --> 01:15:11.514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1129
01:15:11.597 --> 01:15:12.932
DA was a regular too.

1130
01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:16.519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1131
01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:18.813
The Rata Alada.

1132
01:15:18.896 --> 01:15:19.855
The what?

1133
01:15:19.939 --> 01:15:21.398
Riddler's latest.

1134
01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:23.192
The cipher in the maze.

1135
01:15:23.275 --> 01:15:25.778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1136
01:15:27.363 --> 01:15:28.989
A penguin's got wings too.

1137
01:15:30.991 --> 01:15:32.952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1138
01:15:33.035 --> 01:15:34.703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1139
01:15:34.787 --> 01:15:37.998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1140
01:15:38.082 --> 01:15:41.252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.927

1145
01:15:51.554 --> 01:15:52.805

They stopped at Waterfront Street.

1150
01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.582
[Batman] I'm here.

1151

- [Penguin] How you doing?
- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1152

This is a buy.

1157
01:16:48.402 --> 01:16:51.572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1158
01:16:51.655 --> 01:16:52.823
Or they never shut it down at all.

1159

1160
01:16:53.866 --> 01:16:56.994

was a fraud?

What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

1256
01:25:08.152 --> 01:25:10.780
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

1257
01:25:10.863 --> 01:25:12.156
[Gordon] Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

1258
01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:13.657
Cops caught you doing something.

1259
01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:15.367
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

1260
01:25:15.451 --> 01:25:17.328
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

1261
01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:19.538
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:25:19.622 --> 01:25:20.831
His drops operation.

1263
01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:23.375
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

1264
01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:27.088
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

1265
01:25:27.171 --> 01:25:28.923
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

1266
01:25:29.006 --> 01:25:31.342
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

1267
01:25:31.425 --> 01:25:34.637
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

1268
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.888
What are you, crazy?

1269
01:25:35.971 --> 01:25:37.056
[Gordon] That why you killed the girl?

1270
01:25:37.139 --> 01:25:38.099
I didn't kill no girl!

1271
01:25:38.182 --> 01:25:39.975
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

1272
01:25:40.059 --> 01:25:41.352
But she got too close, right?

1273
01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:43.646
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

1274
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:45.689
But somehow Riddler found out too.

1275
01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.691
He knows so much about you.

1276
01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.819
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

1277
01:25:50.403 --> 01:25:52.613
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

1278
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:54.198
Why don't you start harmonizing?

1279
01:25:54.532 --> 01:25:57.201
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

1280
01:25:57.284 --> 01:25:58.619
I ain't no rat!

1281
01:25:58.702 --> 01:26:00.538
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

1282
01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:01.705
if he heard this kind of talk?

1283
01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.958
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

1284
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:06.585
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

1285
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:08.212
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

1286
01:26:08.295 --> 01:26:09.922
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

1287
01:26:10.005 --> 01:26:11.924
[yells] Open your eyes!

1288
01:26:15.845 --> 01:26:17.430
Are you El Rata Alada?

1289
01:26:17.513 --> 01:26:19.014
El Rata Alada?

1290
01:26:19.098 --> 01:26:20.933
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

1291
01:26:21.016 --> 01:26:23.352
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

1292
01:26:23.436 --> 01:26:26.021
It says you are El Rata Alada.

1293
01:26:26.105 --> 01:26:27.481
"You are El Rata"? It says that?

1294
01:26:27.565 --> 01:26:28.774
Why, you got something to tell us?

1295
01:26:28.858 --> 01:26:29.734
Yeah!

1296
01:26:30.401 --> 01:26:31.444
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

1297
01:26:31.527 --> 01:26:32.361
What?

1298
01:26:32.778 --> 01:26:34.113
It's "La."

1299
01:26:34.196 --> 01:26:35.489
"La" rata.

1300
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.992
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

1301
01:26:38.075 --> 01:26:39.952
Jesus! Look at you two.

1302
01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.621
World's greatest detectives!

1303
01:26:43.038 --> 01:26:45.332
Am I the only here knows the difference
between "el" and "la"?

1304
01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:46.500
Jesus!

1305
01:26:46.584 --> 01:26:48.085
No habla español, fellas?

1306
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.171
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1307
01:26:51.589 --> 01:26:52.673
You think he made a mistake?

1308
01:26:52.757 --> 01:26:53.966
He doesn't make mistakes.

1309
01:26:54.049 --> 01:26:55.092
A rat with wings?

1310
01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.761
You know what that sounds like to me?

1311
01:26:56.844 --> 01:27:00.014
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

"You are el."

1314
01:27:20.284 --> 01:27:21.786
Maybe it was a mistake.

1315
01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:23.037
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1316
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:23.954
- [computer beeps]
- Wait.

1317

Yeah.

But too many have been left behind
for too long,

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.683
Her body was in his car.

1421
01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:48.644
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1422
01:36:48.727 --> 01:36:51.730
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1423
01:36:51.814 --> 01:36:53.357
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1424
01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:55.067
She didn't know any better.

1425
01:36:55.151 --> 01:36:56.485
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1426
01:36:56.569 --> 01:36:58.112
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1427
01:36:58.195 --> 01:36:59.697
It means your choices have consequences.

1428
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.158
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1429
01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:04.952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1430
01:37:05.035 --> 01:37:06.871
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1431
01:37:07.204 --> 01:37:09.373
Compromising yourself for money?

1432
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:13.002
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1433
01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:18.299
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1434
01:37:18.382 --> 01:37:19.717
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1435
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.135
Falcone owes me that money.

1436
01:37:21.218 --> 01:37:22.970
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1437
01:37:23.053 --> 01:37:23.888
Oh, really? Why's that?

1438
01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:24.889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1439
01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1440
01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:27.808
would owe you anything.

1441
01:37:27.892 --> 01:37:30.227
[shouts]
Because he's my father!

1442
01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:42.156
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1443
01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:44.950
Just like Anni.

1444
01:37:47.119 --> 01:37:49.663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1445
01:37:51.749 --> 01:37:53.084
To the club?

1446
01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:55.002
Yeah.

1447
01:37:57.713 --> 01:38:00.591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1448
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.802
Used to see him there.

1449
01:38:03.552 --> 01:38:05.554
He scared the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:07.515 --> 01:38:10.976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1451
01:38:11.519 --> 01:38:15.356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1452
01:38:18.734 --> 01:38:21.070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1453
01:38:21.737 --> 01:38:23.239
Strangled.

1454
01:38:23.656 --> 01:38:27.118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1455
01:38:28.994 --> 01:38:31.080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1456
01:38:31.163 --> 01:38:33.332
and he didn't say a thing.

1457
01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:36.961
Couldn't even look at me.

1458
01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.466
He owes me that money.

1459
01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:45.678
I'm sorry.

1460
01:38:46.804 --> 01:38:47.972
For what I said.

1461
01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:50.766
Oh, it's all right.

1462
01:38:51.475 --> 01:38:52.393
[chuckles dryly]

1463
01:38:54.311 --> 01:38:56.397
You assume the worst in people.

1464
01:38:57.314 --> 01:38:58.691
Which, well...

1465
01:39:00.985 --> 01:39:02.903
maybe we're not so different after all.

1466
01:39:08.367 --> 01:39:10.119
Who are you under there?

1467
01:39:16.208 --> 01:39:18.085
What are you hiding?

1468
01:39:20.463 --> 01:39:22.298
Are you just...

1469
01:39:23.883 --> 01:39:25.593
hideously scarred?

1470
01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:28.721
Yeah.

1471
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.015
[chuckles lightly]

1472
01:39:35.978 --> 01:39:37.396
Listen to me.

1473
01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:41.817
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1474
01:39:42.985 --> 01:39:47.656
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1475
01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:51.368
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1476
01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:52.703
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1477
01:39:52.787 --> 01:39:54.038
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1478
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:56.165
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1479
01:39:56.248 --> 01:39:57.500
I think you'd be on his side.

1480
01:39:57.583 --> 01:39:59.210
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1481
01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:01.253
What, do you live in a cave?

1482
01:40:01.337 --> 01:40:03.422
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1483
01:40:04.507 --> 01:40:08.385
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1484
01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.678
will you help me?

1485
01:40:10.930 --> 01:40:12.223
Please.

1486
01:40:15.017 --> 01:40:16.936
Come on, Vengeance.

1487
01:40:19.396 --> 01:40:21.649
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1488
01:40:21.732 --> 01:40:23.359
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

[romantic music playing]

1490
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:34.453
I told you, baby.

1491
01:40:36.372 --> 01:40:38.958
I can take care of myself.

1492
01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.055
[Thomas] I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

[triumphant music playing]

1494
01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:04.483
From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...

1495
01:41:04.608 --> 01:41:06.444
...instilled in both of us

1496
01:41:06.652 --> 01:41:09.071
that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1497
01:41:09.238 --> 01:41:10.698
it's a passion.

1498
01:41:11.407 --> 01:41:13.743
That is our family's legacy.

1499
01:41:14.952 --> 01:41:17.288
[Riddler on TV]
The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1500
01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:19.832
Gotham's founding families.

1501
01:41:19.915 --> 01:41:23.085
But what is their real legacy?

1502
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:29.091
Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.

1503
01:41:29.175 --> 01:41:32.845
He found shocking family secrets.

1504
01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:35.097
How, when Martha was just a child,

1505
01:41:35.181 --> 01:41:37.683
her mother brutally murdered her father,

1506
01:41:37.767 --> 01:41:39.393
- then committed suicide...
- [gunshot]

1507
01:41:39.477 --> 01:41:45.065
...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.

1508
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:49.820
How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years

1509
01:41:49.904 --> 01:41:52.281
and they didn't want anyone to know.

1510
01:41:53.115 --> 01:41:55.618
Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter

1511
01:41:55.701 --> 01:41:59.622
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1512
01:41:59.747 --> 01:42:01.791
[raises voice]
But when the reporter refused...

1513
01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:06.587
...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone

1514
01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:09.256
[laughs hysterically]
and had him murdered!

- [gunshot]
- The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1516
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:18.265
Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.

1517
01:42:18.766 --> 01:42:21.143
I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1518
01:42:21.227 --> 01:42:23.604
This is your legacy too.

1519
01:42:23.687 --> 01:42:27.149

1520

01:42:41.872 --> 01:42:42.998
You're Bruce Wayne.

1525
01:42:43.082 --> 01:42:44.959
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1526

the concept of it, right?

Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1535
01:43:19.785 --> 01:43:20.786
[Briscoe] No, boss.

1550
01:43:57.406 --> 01:43:58.407

1551
01:44:00.451 --> 01:44:02.244
I thought I might hear from you.

- Is it true?
- What?

1555

01:44:15.925 --> 01:44:17.134
What do you want to know here, kid?

1557
01:44:17.218 --> 01:44:20.012
Did you kill him? For my father?

1558
01:44:20.096 --> 01:44:22.848
Look, your father was in trouble.

1559
01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:25.518
This reporter had some dirt.

1560
01:44:25.601 --> 01:44:27.228
Some very...

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:32.149
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1562
01:44:32.233 --> 01:44:34.944
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1563
01:44:35.027 --> 01:44:36.487
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1564
01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:38.489
not right before the election.

1565
01:44:38.948 --> 01:44:41.242
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1566
01:44:41.325 --> 01:44:42.952
but he wasn't going for it.

1567
01:44:43.035 --> 01:44:46.205
So, he came to me.

1568
01:44:46.288 --> 01:44:48.666
Well, I never seen him like that.

1569
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.335
He said, "Carmine,

1570
01:44:52.128 --> 01:44:56.841
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1571
01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:02.179
And when fear isn't enough...

1572
01:45:02.847 --> 01:45:04.682
Oof. Hmm.

1573
01:45:06.016 --> 01:45:09.353
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1574
01:45:10.354 --> 01:45:12.189
I handled it.

1575
01:45:13.899 --> 01:45:15.317
I know.

1576
01:45:15.401 --> 01:45:17.653
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1577
01:45:18.904 --> 01:45:20.740
But you'd be surprised

1578
01:45:20.823 --> 01:45:23.200
what even a good man like him

1579
01:45:23.284 --> 01:45:25.870
is capable of in the right situation.

1580
01:45:28.122 --> 01:45:29.582
Do me a favor.

1581
01:45:29.915 --> 01:45:31.959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1582
01:45:32.668 --> 01:45:34.253
This reporter

1583
01:45:35.087 --> 01:45:36.672
was a lowlife.

1584
01:45:36.756 --> 01:45:38.215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1585
01:45:39.842 --> 01:45:41.469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1586
01:45:42.219 --> 01:45:45.473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1587
01:45:46.891 --> 01:45:50.394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1588
01:45:50.478 --> 01:45:52.813
that your father would be in my pocket,

1589
01:45:53.564 --> 01:45:54.565
forever.

1590
01:45:55.232 --> 01:45:57.276
He would have done anything

1591
01:45:57.359 --> 01:45:59.528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1592
01:45:59.612 --> 01:46:00.946
You understand?

1593
01:46:02.156 --> 01:46:06.702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1594
01:46:06.786 --> 01:46:08.829
Do I know it for a fact?

1595
01:46:11.248 --> 01:46:13.334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1596
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:17.004
This is what you wanted, huh?

1597
01:46:17.088 --> 01:46:19.507
This little conversation here?

1598
01:46:20.007 --> 01:46:21.425
[exhales ruefully]

1599
01:46:21.926 --> 01:46:24.095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1600
01:46:26.722 --> 01:46:28.849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1601
01:46:32.311 --> 01:46:34.396
[melancholy music playing]

1602
01:47:18.524 --> 01:47:20.484
[EKG machine beeping]

1603
01:47:23.946 --> 01:47:25.614
[inhales sharply]

1604
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:32.621
[rain pattering]

1605
01:47:35.416 --> 01:47:36.500
[sighs]

1606
01:47:38.252 --> 01:47:39.545
You lied to me...

1607
01:47:42.381 --> 01:47:44.008
my whole life.

1608
01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:51.223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1609
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:57.605
He told me what he did for my father.

1610
01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:03.110
About Salvatore Maroni.

1611
01:48:05.112 --> 01:48:07.823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1612
01:48:07.907 --> 01:48:09.658
Had my father killed.

1613
01:48:12.119 --> 01:48:14.330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1614
01:48:17.083 --> 01:48:21.629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1615
01:48:21.712 --> 01:48:24.048
believing that he was a good man.

1616
01:48:24.131 --> 01:48:25.716
He was a good man.

1617
01:48:26.884 --> 01:48:28.594
You listen to me.

1618
01:48:28.677 --> 01:48:32.098
Your father was a good man.

1619
01:48:35.726 --> 01:48:37.645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1620
01:48:37.728 --> 01:48:39.647
He had a man killed.

1621
01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:40.815
Why?

1622
01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:45.236
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1623
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.571
His political aspirations?

1624
01:48:47.655 --> 01:48:51.200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1625
01:48:53.786 --> 01:48:55.329
He was protecting your mother.

1626
01:48:56.288 --> 01:48:59.834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1627
01:48:59.917 --> 01:49:02.044
He cared about her,

1628
01:49:02.128 --> 01:49:03.421
and you,

1629
01:49:03.504 --> 01:49:06.424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1630
01:49:06.507 --> 01:49:09.969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1631
01:49:10.845 --> 01:49:14.181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1632
01:49:14.265 --> 01:49:17.393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1633
01:49:17.476 --> 01:49:19.311
That's who Falcone is.

1634
01:49:21.564 --> 01:49:23.774
And that was your father's mistake.

1635
01:49:23.858 --> 01:49:25.901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1636
01:49:25.985 --> 01:49:28.738
your father was distraught.

1637
01:49:29.613 --> 01:49:32.825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1638
01:49:32.908 --> 01:49:35.077
that he would confess everything.

1639
01:49:36.579 --> 01:49:38.581
And that night,

1640
01:49:38.664 --> 01:49:42.585
your father and your mother were killed.

1641
01:49:45.004 --> 01:49:47.173
[soft music playing]

1642
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:49.842
It was Falcone?

1643
01:49:54.346 --> 01:49:55.806
[smacks lips]

1644
01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:58.017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1645
01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:06.275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1646
01:50:06.358 --> 01:50:09.111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1647
01:50:09.195 --> 01:50:14.408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1648
01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:20.039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1649
01:50:20.706 --> 01:50:22.500
I know you always blamed yourself.

1650
01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:25.127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1651
01:50:27.296 --> 01:50:29.590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1652
01:50:31.008 --> 01:50:33.385
but I didn't know how to help.

1653
01:50:33.469 --> 01:50:35.971
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1654
01:50:37.348 --> 01:50:40.017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1655
01:50:40.101 --> 01:50:41.936
You needed a father.

1656
01:50:43.896 --> 01:50:46.315
And all you had was me.

1657
01:50:48.692 --> 01:50:49.902
I'm sorry.

1658
01:50:51.654 --> 01:50:53.572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1659
01:51:00.371 --> 01:51:01.455
God.

1660
01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1661
01:51:11.632 --> 01:51:13.759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1662
01:51:20.182 --> 01:51:21.434
I mean,

1663
01:51:22.643 --> 01:51:24.770
I'm not afraid to die.

1664
01:51:26.522 --> 01:51:28.899
I realize now there's something

1665
01:51:30.025 --> 01:51:31.902
I haven't got past.

1666
01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.572
This fear...

1667
01:51:37.032 --> 01:51:39.994
of ever going through any of that again.

1668
01:51:44.248 --> 01:51:46.459
Of losing somebody I care about.

1669
01:51:47.793 --> 01:51:50.087
[soft music continues]

1670
01:52:14.403 --> 01:52:16.113
[soft dramatic music playing]

1671
01:52:19.116 --> 01:52:20.785
[engine revving]

1672
01:52:37.051 --> 01:52:38.010
Hey.

1673
01:52:38.094 --> 01:52:40.846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1674
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:42.848
I thought it was you.

1675
01:52:47.019 --> 01:52:48.395
[both grunting]

1676
01:52:55.778 --> 01:52:57.321
- I found him!
- I see that.

1677
01:52:57.405 --> 01:52:58.906
He had my shit and my phone.

1678
01:52:58.989 --> 01:53:00.199
She left a message
the night they took her.

1679
01:53:00.282 --> 01:53:01.200
She called me...

1680
01:53:01.283 --> 01:53:02.993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1681
01:53:03.077 --> 01:53:04.370
She got my gun!

1682
01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:05.621
[grunts]

1683
01:53:05.704 --> 01:53:07.415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1684
01:53:08.958 --> 01:53:11.502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1685
01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:18.175
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1686
01:53:20.136 --> 01:53:21.804
[Kenzie on recording]
Hey! Get back here!

1687
01:53:21.929 --> 01:53:24.098
- [Annika whimpering]
- Where you going? Come back here!

1688
01:53:24.181 --> 01:53:26.267
[Falcone] Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1689
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:27.685
You're scaring her.

1690
01:53:27.768 --> 01:53:29.478
[Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1691
01:53:29.562 --> 01:53:30.604
[Annika, tearfully]
Please, please, please.

1692
01:53:30.688 --> 01:53:31.981
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1693
01:53:32.064 --> 01:53:34.734
[Falcone]
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1694
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:38.654
Now let me ask you again.

1695
01:53:39.363 --> 01:53:41.907
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- [Annika] No, nothing. He...

1696
01:53:41.991 --> 01:53:44.910
[Falcone] Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1697
01:53:44.994 --> 01:53:47.705
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1698
01:53:48.247 --> 01:53:50.249
That's why I made him
take your passport...

1699
01:53:50.958 --> 01:53:53.836
until we could have
this little conversation.

1700
01:53:53.919 --> 01:53:56.630
[Annika] All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1701
01:53:56.714 --> 01:53:58.841
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...

1702
01:53:58.924 --> 01:54:02.052
[Falcone] We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1703
01:54:02.887 --> 01:54:05.431
But first, I gotta know...

1704
01:54:06.515 --> 01:54:07.850
What did he tell you?

1705
01:54:08.642 --> 01:54:12.188
[Annika] He just said
they all made a deal with you.

1706
01:54:12.688 --> 01:54:13.898
[Falcone] Oh. Hmm.

1707
01:54:13.981 --> 01:54:15.941
He told you about that, huh?

1708
01:54:16.025 --> 01:54:17.318
The deal.

1709
01:54:17.401 --> 01:54:22.323
[Annika] He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1710
01:54:22.406 --> 01:54:25.117
and that's how he became mayor.

1711
01:54:25.201 --> 01:54:27.578
He said you were a very important man.

1712
01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:28.788
[Falcone] Right.

1713
01:54:29.538 --> 01:54:30.915
Mm-hmm.

1714
01:54:31.874 --> 01:54:34.043
Hmm. Okay.

1715
01:54:36.128 --> 01:54:37.880
- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1716
01:54:38.839 --> 01:54:40.341
- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1717
01:54:41.717 --> 01:54:43.052
- [Falcone] Just take it easy.
- [Annika choking]

1718
01:54:43.135 --> 01:54:44.678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1719
01:54:44.762 --> 01:54:47.807
[Falcone] Take it easy.

1720
01:54:49.934 --> 01:54:51.352
[recording stops]

1721
01:54:57.024 --> 01:54:58.317
Rata Alada.

1722
01:55:03.072 --> 01:55:04.865
A falcon has wings too.

1723
01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:07.034
Falcone is the rat?

1724
01:55:18.003 --> 01:55:21.173
Falcone works for you guys?

1725
01:55:21.841 --> 01:55:24.385
The mayor? The DA?

1726
01:55:27.388 --> 01:55:28.472
No.

1727
01:55:28.806 --> 01:55:30.307
[breathing shakily]

1728
01:55:31.559 --> 01:55:32.852
We work for him.

1729
01:55:33.853 --> 01:55:35.104
Everybody does.

1730
01:55:35.187 --> 01:55:36.188
How?

1731
01:55:36.272 --> 01:55:37.857
Through Renewal.

1732
01:55:38.649 --> 01:55:40.025
Renewal is everything.

1733
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:41.444
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1734
01:55:42.027 --> 01:55:45.740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1735
01:55:45.823 --> 01:55:49.410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1736
01:55:49.493 --> 01:55:52.872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1737
01:55:52.955 --> 01:55:55.040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1738
01:55:55.124 --> 01:55:56.834
Everybody got a piece.

1739
01:55:56.917 --> 01:55:58.753
But Falcone wanted more.

1740
01:56:00.546 --> 01:56:03.758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1741
01:56:05.176 --> 01:56:07.511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1742
01:56:07.887 --> 01:56:10.598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1743
01:56:10.681 --> 01:56:13.142
then install them all as his puppets.

1744
01:56:13.225 --> 01:56:15.770
You think this goddamn election matters?

1745
01:56:17.396 --> 01:56:19.315
Falcone's the mayor.

1746
01:56:20.274 --> 01:56:22.777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1747
01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:24.236
Come on, Vengeance.

1748
01:56:24.945 --> 01:56:26.781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1749
01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:29.116
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1750
01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.034
No!

1751
01:56:30.159 --> 01:56:31.160
[gun clatters]

1752
01:56:31.494 --> 01:56:32.703
We'll get him.

1753
01:56:33.370 --> 01:56:35.247
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1754
01:56:35.331 --> 01:56:36.457
He owns the city!

1755
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.792
Cross that line...

1756
01:56:38.584 --> 01:56:39.877
you'll become just like him.

1757
01:56:40.586 --> 01:56:42.129
Listen to me.

1758
01:56:42.213 --> 01:56:44.090
Don't throw your life away.

1759
01:56:50.638 --> 01:56:52.014
Don't worry, honey.

1760
01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:56.560
I got nine of 'em.

1761
01:56:56.685 --> 01:56:58.646
- [screams]
- [Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!

1762
01:56:59.939 --> 01:57:01.232
[Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]

1763
01:57:10.533 --> 01:57:11.659
[Gordon]
She won't get out of there alive.

1764
01:57:11.826 --> 01:57:14.412
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1765
01:57:14.495 --> 01:57:15.496
I have to stop her.

1766
01:57:15.663 --> 01:57:16.622
Don't you mean "we"?

1767
01:57:17.957 --> 01:57:19.500
I gotta do this my way.

1768
01:57:19.834 --> 01:57:20.835
And then what?

1769
01:57:21.710 --> 01:57:23.087
We do what Riddler said.

1770

I'd like to come up?

01:58:03.627 --> 01:58:05.087
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1775
01:58:05.713 --> 01:58:07.047
Tell him it's about Annika.

Look who it is, huh?

1778
01:58:13.971 --> 01:58:16.390
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1779
01:58:16.474 --> 01:58:18.476
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1780
01:58:18.642 --> 01:58:20.102
Absolutely.

1781
01:58:21.854 --> 01:58:22.855

I don't know where she is.

1788
01:58:55.721 --> 01:58:59.100
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1789
01:58:59.183 --> 01:59:02.603
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1790
01:59:04.105 --> 01:59:06.482
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

It's okay.

1794
01:59:10.444 --> 01:59:12.571
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1795
01:59:12.738 --> 01:59:15.616
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1796
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:20.788
Mr. Falcone?

1797
01:59:20.871 --> 01:59:22.331
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1798
01:59:22.415 --> 01:59:25.334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1799

[Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.

1800

The deal.

1812

[Annika] He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1813

Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

Maybe I am.

Really, Oz?

02:10:01.011 --> 02:10:02.555
[suspenseful music playing]

1943
02:10:22.324 --> 02:10:24.034
What are all these diaries?

1944
02:10:24.118 --> 02:10:26.537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1945
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:30.166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1946
02:10:30.249 --> 02:10:31.792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1947
02:10:31.876 --> 02:10:34.170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1948
02:10:34.253 --> 02:10:36.088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1949
02:10:36.172 --> 02:10:38.591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1950
02:10:38.674 --> 02:10:40.426
What about chain of evidence?

1951
02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:42.470
You should see this.

1952
02:10:48.434 --> 02:10:49.935
He's wearing gloves.

1953
02:10:51.395 --> 02:10:53.647
"Friday, July 16th.

1954
02:10:53.731 --> 02:10:57.443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1955
02:10:57.777 --> 02:11:00.821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1956
02:11:00.905 --> 02:11:02.323
But then, today, I saw it.

1957
02:11:02.406 --> 02:11:06.535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1958
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:09.663
'Renewal.'

1959
02:11:09.747 --> 02:11:14.168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1960
02:11:14.251 --> 02:11:17.379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1961
02:11:17.463 --> 02:11:20.800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1962
02:11:20.883 --> 02:11:23.344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1963
02:11:23.427 --> 02:11:26.430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1964
02:11:27.556 --> 02:11:29.391
- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

1965
02:11:29.475 --> 02:11:31.310
really understand,

1966
02:11:31.393 --> 02:11:33.687
you can't just give them the answers.

1967
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:35.231
You have to confront them,

1968
02:11:35.314 --> 02:11:37.733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1969
02:11:37.817 --> 02:11:39.985
just like they tortured me.

1970
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:42.863
I know now what I must become."

1971
02:11:45.825 --> 02:11:47.159
Jesus.

1972
02:11:47.326 --> 02:11:48.494
[bat screeching]

1973
02:11:53.249 --> 02:11:55.209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1974
02:11:55.751 --> 02:11:57.253
This one's not a rat.

1975
02:11:57.670 --> 02:11:59.672
- [rat continues squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

1976
02:12:03.884 --> 02:12:04.927
[screeching violently]

1977
02:12:13.894 --> 02:12:15.020
[Gordon] What is that?

1978
02:12:17.731 --> 02:12:19.233
[bat screeching frantically]

1979
02:12:46.635 --> 02:12:47.845
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1980
02:12:47.928 --> 02:12:49.305
Is it a chisel?

1981
02:12:49.388 --> 02:12:50.848
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1982
02:12:50.931 --> 02:12:52.308
He killed Mitchell with it.

1983
02:12:52.975 --> 02:12:55.853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1984
02:13:04.445 --> 02:13:06.447
"My confession"?

1985
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:09.408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1986
02:13:09.492 --> 02:13:10.868
This isn't over.

1987
02:13:10.951 --> 02:13:13.370
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1988
02:13:13.788 --> 02:13:15.998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1989
02:13:16.373 --> 02:13:17.666
[typing]

1990
02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:26.300
His final post was last night.

1991
02:13:26.383 --> 02:13:29.595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1992
02:13:29.678 --> 02:13:32.681
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1993
02:13:32.807 --> 02:13:36.227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1994
02:13:36.727 --> 02:13:38.312
[ominous music playing]

1995
02:13:47.571 --> 02:13:50.116
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1996
02:13:51.742 --> 02:13:53.452
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1997
02:13:54.286 --> 02:13:55.913
I think I'm his last target.

1998
02:13:58.499 --> 02:13:59.583
You?

1999
02:13:59.959 --> 02:14:02.002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

2000
02:14:02.545 --> 02:14:03.921
What is?

2001
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.798
The Batman.

2002
02:14:06.048 --> 02:14:07.216
[cell phone ringing]

2003
02:14:11.178 --> 02:14:12.346
Yeah?

2004
02:14:23.649 --> 02:14:24.859
Right.

2005
02:14:27.737 --> 02:14:31.699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2006
02:14:39.165 --> 02:14:40.666
You're a good cop.

2007
02:15:05.274 --> 02:15:07.651
[over speaker]
I told you I'd see you in hell.

2008
02:15:08.402 --> 02:15:10.237
[Batman] What do you want from me?

2009
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:11.864
[Riddler] "Want"?

2010
02:15:12.448 --> 02:15:16.077
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.

2011
02:15:17.286 --> 02:15:18.621
For this moment.

2012
02:15:19.663 --> 02:15:22.666
I've been invisible my whole life.

2013
02:15:23.751 --> 02:15:26.378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

2014
02:15:27.922 --> 02:15:30.341
They'll remember me now.

2015
02:15:30.424 --> 02:15:32.259
They'll remember both of us.

2016
02:15:42.645 --> 02:15:44.605
Bruce...

2017
02:15:47.483 --> 02:15:49.318
Wayne.

2018
02:15:51.695 --> 02:15:55.449
[slowly] Bruce...

2019
02:15:56.867 --> 02:15:59.745
Wayne.

2020
02:16:05.501 --> 02:16:06.544
[exhales deeply]

2021
02:16:11.006 --> 02:16:13.426
You know, I was there that day.

2022
02:16:16.011 --> 02:16:19.390
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,

2023
02:16:19.473 --> 02:16:21.851
made all those promises.

2024
02:16:24.311 --> 02:16:28.566
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.

2025
02:16:29.108 --> 02:16:32.653
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

2026
02:16:32.737 --> 02:16:36.407
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

2027
02:16:36.991 --> 02:16:38.534
Orphan.

2028
02:16:44.206 --> 02:16:49.336
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.

2029
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:55.259
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

2030
02:16:55.926 --> 02:16:57.470
Don't you tell me.

2031
02:17:00.097 --> 02:17:02.767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2032
02:17:03.142 --> 02:17:05.728
It's 30 kids to a room.

2033
02:17:07.021 --> 02:17:11.067
Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.

2034
02:17:12.777 --> 02:17:17.448
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.

2035
02:17:18.616 --> 02:17:21.786
And every winter one of the babies die

2036
02:17:21.869 --> 02:17:24.163
because it's so cold.

2037
02:17:25.456 --> 02:17:28.042
But, oh, no.

2038
02:17:29.335 --> 02:17:30.586
[smacks lips]

2039
02:17:30.961 --> 02:17:34.131
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy

2040
02:17:34.215 --> 02:17:37.134
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

2041
02:17:37.218 --> 02:17:38.219
Doesn't it?

2042
02:17:39.678 --> 02:17:41.722
Bruce...

2043
02:17:42.765 --> 02:17:44.683
Wayne.

2044
02:17:48.354 --> 02:17:51.440
He's the only one we didn't get.

2045
02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:57.988
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

2046
02:17:59.448 --> 02:18:03.327
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

2047
02:18:06.497 --> 02:18:07.665
God.

2048
02:18:08.666 --> 02:18:09.959
Look at you.

2049
02:18:11.627 --> 02:18:14.088
Your mask is amazing.

2050
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:17.091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2051
02:18:17.174 --> 02:18:18.259
Ain't it funny?

2052
02:18:18.342 --> 02:18:22.763
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.

2053
02:18:24.223 --> 02:18:26.267
You and I both know

2054
02:18:27.226 --> 02:18:29.728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2055
02:18:29.812 --> 02:18:33.441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2056
02:18:33.524 --> 02:18:35.067
No shame,

2057
02:18:35.985 --> 02:18:36.986
no limits.

2058
02:18:37.069 --> 02:18:38.738
Why did you write me?

2059
02:18:39.613 --> 02:18:40.614
What do you mean?

2060
02:18:40.698 --> 02:18:42.408
All those cards.

2061
02:18:42.491 --> 02:18:43.701
I told you,

2062
02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:46.328
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.

2063
02:18:46.412 --> 02:18:48.622
- We didn't do anything together.
- We did.

2064
02:18:48.706 --> 02:18:50.166
What did we just do?

2065
02:18:50.249 --> 02:18:52.251
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.

2066
02:18:52.334 --> 02:18:53.502
We're such a good team.

2067
02:18:53.586 --> 02:18:54.587
We're not a team.

2068
02:18:54.670 --> 02:18:57.173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2069
02:18:57.256 --> 02:18:59.675
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

2070
02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:02.928
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

2071
02:19:03.012 --> 02:19:04.638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2072
02:19:04.722 --> 02:19:05.931
You gave me that.

2073
02:19:06.015 --> 02:19:07.141
I gave you nothing.

2074
02:19:07.224 --> 02:19:09.810
You showed me what was possible.

2075
02:19:09.894 --> 02:19:14.774
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.

2076
02:19:14.857 --> 02:19:16.400
You inspired me.

2077
02:19:16.484 --> 02:19:17.985
You're out of your goddamn mind.

2078
02:19:19.111 --> 02:19:20.196
What?

2079
02:19:20.279 --> 02:19:22.448
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

2080
02:19:22.531 --> 02:19:23.908
How can you say that?

2081
02:19:23.991 --> 02:19:25.493
You think you'll be remembered?

2082
02:19:25.576 --> 02:19:27.244
You're a pathetic psychopath,

2083
02:19:27.745 --> 02:19:29.497
- begging for attention.
- No.

2084
02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:31.248
- You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
- No.

2085
02:19:31.332 --> 02:19:32.374
No, no!

2086
02:19:32.458 --> 02:19:33.375
A nobody!

2087
02:19:35.169 --> 02:19:36.962
No!

2088
02:19:38.881 --> 02:19:41.258
Ahhh!

2089
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:44.095
This is not how this was supposed to go!

2090
02:19:45.054 --> 02:19:48.682
Ahhh!

2091
02:19:48.766 --> 02:19:51.393
I had it all planned out!

2092
02:19:52.394 --> 02:19:54.396
We were gonna be safe here.

2093
02:19:54.772 --> 02:19:58.067
We could watch the whole thing together.

2094
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:59.151
Watch what?

2095
02:19:59.235 --> 02:20:00.986
Everything!

2096
02:20:02.738 --> 02:20:04.156
[tense music playing]

2097
02:20:09.328 --> 02:20:10.996
It was all there.

2098
02:20:13.165 --> 02:20:15.501
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

2099
02:20:16.669 --> 02:20:17.878
[Riddler gasps slowly]

2100
02:20:19.797 --> 02:20:23.717
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

2101
02:20:25.761 --> 02:20:27.847
I guess I gave you too much credit.

2102
02:20:28.305 --> 02:20:29.557
What have you done?

2103
02:20:30.266 --> 02:20:35.146
What's black and blue and dead all over?

2104
02:20:37.982 --> 02:20:39.817
You.

2105
02:20:41.485 --> 02:20:43.612
If you think you can stop
what's coming...

2106
02:20:44.947 --> 02:20:46.490
What have you done?

2107
02:20:48.033 --> 02:20:53.873
[sings in falsetto]
Ave Maria

2108
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:56.167
[shouting] What have you done?

2109
02:20:58.627 --> 02:21:00.004
Gratia plena

2110
02:21:00.171 --> 02:21:01.589
What have you done?

2111
02:21:02.214 --> 02:21:03.299
[growls]

2112
02:21:05.593 --> 02:21:08.971
Maria

2113
02:21:09.138 --> 02:21:14.685
Gratia plena

2114
02:21:19.732 --> 02:21:21.192
[suspenseful music playing]

2115
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:47.927
[Martinez] Hey!

2116
02:21:48.928 --> 02:21:50.221
What are you doing in here?

2117
02:22:08.155 --> 02:22:10.741
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

2118
02:22:14.245 --> 02:22:15.204
[bottles clink]

2119
02:22:17.331 --> 02:22:19.792
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

2120
02:22:20.668 --> 02:22:23.421
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

2121
02:22:28.092 --> 02:22:31.137
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

2122
02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:33.389
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

2123
02:22:33.472 --> 02:22:35.724
It's a tucker.

2124
02:22:36.058 --> 02:22:37.726
[suspenseful music continues]

2125
02:22:53.534 --> 02:22:54.535
Huh.

2126
02:23:09.717 --> 02:23:12.511
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

2127
02:23:12.595 --> 02:23:14.096
What are you doing?

2128
02:23:23.063 --> 02:23:24.648
[suspenseful music builds up]

2129
02:23:28.652 --> 02:23:30.321
[dramatic music playing]

2130
02:23:44.627 --> 02:23:46.045
[Riddler] Hey, guys.

2131
02:23:46.378 --> 02:23:48.589
Uh, thanks for all the comments

2132
02:23:48.672 --> 02:23:51.634
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.

2133
02:23:51.717 --> 02:23:52.718
Detonators?

2134
02:23:52.802 --> 02:23:57.848
I just want to say this will be my last
post for a little while, and, uh...

2135
02:24:00.101 --> 02:24:02.186
what this community has meant to me

2136
02:24:02.269 --> 02:24:05.272
these weeks, these months,

2137
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:08.609
let's just say none of us...

2138
02:24:10.319 --> 02:24:12.446
is alone anymore. Okay?

2139
02:24:13.155 --> 02:24:14.240
Jesus.

2140
02:24:14.532 --> 02:24:15.574
[Riddler huffing]

2141
02:24:17.576 --> 02:24:18.577
[inhales deeply]

2142
02:24:18.702 --> 02:24:21.288
Tomorrow's Election Day.

2143
02:24:21.455 --> 02:24:23.082
[laughing]

2144
02:24:23.874 --> 02:24:26.502
And Bella Reál will win.

2145
02:24:26.585 --> 02:24:29.213
She promised real change.

2146
02:24:29.922 --> 02:24:32.299
But we know the truth, don't we?

2147
02:24:32.383 --> 02:24:34.468
You've seen Gotham's true face now.

2148
02:24:34.552 --> 02:24:36.429
Together, we've unmasked it.

2149
02:24:36.512 --> 02:24:39.473
Its corruption, its perversion

2150
02:24:39.557 --> 02:24:43.394
masquerading under the guise of renewal.

2151
02:24:43.477 --> 02:24:47.314
But unmasking is not enough.

2152
02:24:49.525 --> 02:24:53.529
The day of judgment is finally upon us.

2153
02:24:53.612 --> 02:24:55.990
[in playful tone] And now it is time

2154
02:24:57.074 --> 02:24:59.452
for retribution.

2155
02:24:59.535 --> 02:25:02.329
I've parked seven vans

2156
02:25:02.621 --> 02:25:04.957
all along the city seawall.

2157
02:25:06.167 --> 02:25:08.043
And on the big night,

2158
02:25:08.127 --> 02:25:10.379
[whispers] they will go boom.

2159
02:25:14.133 --> 02:25:15.843
[dramatic music playing]

2160
02:25:21.265 --> 02:25:22.683
[explosion]

2161
02:25:24.643 --> 02:25:25.895
- [explosion]
- [inaudible] Boom!

2162
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:32.610
- [explosion]
- [inaudible] Boom!

2163
02:25:35.279 --> 02:25:37.531
When the vans blow,

2164
02:25:37.615 --> 02:25:43.245
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

2165
02:25:43.579 --> 02:25:46.540
Those who are not washed away

2166
02:25:46.624 --> 02:25:49.627
will race through the streets in terror.

2167
02:25:49.794 --> 02:25:50.795
- [panicked screams]
- Call Gordon.

2168
02:25:50.878 --> 02:25:53.005
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2169
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:56.217
- [crowd cheering]
- [Riddler] As breaking news

2170
02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:58.219
hits higher ground
in Gotham Square Garden...

2171
02:25:58.344 --> 02:26:01.305
...celebrations will turn to panic,

2172
02:26:01.388 --> 02:26:06.227
as the venue becomes
the city's shelter of last resort.

2173
02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:07.478
[sirens wailing]

2174
02:26:07.603 --> 02:26:11.607
And that's where all of you come in.

2175
02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:21.325
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

2176
02:26:21.409 --> 02:26:23.577
The pigs will have me in their custody,

2177
02:26:23.661 --> 02:26:25.704
but that's okay.

2178
02:26:25.788 --> 02:26:30.292
Because then it will be your turn.

2179
02:26:30.376 --> 02:26:34.255
You'll be there, waiting.

2180
02:26:34.463 --> 02:26:36.257
[dramatic music playing]

2181
02:26:45.307 --> 02:26:48.227
It's time for the lies to finally end.

2182
02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:52.440
[dramatically]
False promises of renewal?

2183
02:26:52.523 --> 02:26:53.607
Change?

2184
02:26:54.024 --> 02:26:57.820
We'll give them real, real change now.

2185
02:26:57.903 --> 02:27:02.908
We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, [shouts] suffering!

2186
02:27:03.367 --> 02:27:05.870
Wondering, "Why us?"

2187
02:27:05.953 --> 02:27:09.081
Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,

2188
02:27:09.165 --> 02:27:11.333
[screams] why them?

2189
02:27:11.417 --> 02:27:13.461
I can't get through! The lines are down.

2190
02:27:14.795 --> 02:27:16.088
[sirens wailing]

2191
02:27:19.091 --> 02:27:21.260
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

2192
02:27:21.844 --> 02:27:23.471
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

2193
02:27:23.554 --> 02:27:26.432
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

2194
02:27:26.515 --> 02:27:28.476
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

2195
02:27:28.559 --> 02:27:29.602
[distant explosion]

2196
02:27:30.019 --> 02:27:31.645
[people screaming]

2197
02:27:33.606 --> 02:27:34.690
[crowd clamoring]

2198
02:27:35.649 --> 02:27:36.567
[sirens wailing]

2199
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:39.779
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

2200
02:27:39.862 --> 02:27:41.363
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

2201
02:27:41.447 --> 02:27:43.282
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

2202
02:27:43.365 --> 02:27:44.617
We got an active situation.

2203
02:27:44.742 --> 02:27:46.035
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

2204
02:27:46.118 --> 02:27:47.328
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

2205
02:27:47.411 --> 02:27:48.329
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

2206
02:27:48.412 --> 02:27:49.246
Come!

2207
02:27:49.330 --> 02:27:50.623
[crowd chattering]

2208
02:27:52.249 --> 02:27:53.334
[tense music playing]

2209
02:28:25.282 --> 02:28:26.700
- [man] If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

2210
02:28:26.784 --> 02:28:27.660
...we're gonna have huge problems.

2211
02:28:27.743 --> 02:28:29.120
The water's already started to breach.

2212
02:28:29.203 --> 02:28:30.746
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

2213
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:33.040
[man] Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

2214
02:28:33.124 --> 02:28:34.959
[Bella] I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

2215
02:28:35.042 --> 02:28:37.378
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

2216
02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:39.713
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

2217
02:28:39.797 --> 02:28:42.049
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

2218
02:28:42.133 --> 02:28:43.968
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

2219
02:28:44.051 --> 02:28:47.054
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

2220
02:28:47.138 --> 02:28:48.639
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

2221
02:28:53.811 --> 02:28:57.273
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

2222
02:28:57.356 --> 02:28:59.650
Please! I just need your attention!

02:35:10.479 --> 02:35:11.814
[continues panting]

2294
02:35:19.739 --> 02:35:21.240
[suspenseful music builds up]

2295
02:35:25.327 --> 02:35:26.537
[woman screaming]

2296
02:35:26.829 --> 02:35:28.330
[crowd screams in panic]

2297
02:35:36.297 --> 02:35:37.298
[electricity buzzing]

2298
02:35:39.884 --> 02:35:41.051
[people screaming and groaning]

2299
02:35:49.226 --> 02:35:50.519
[screaming continues]

2300
02:35:52.229 --> 02:35:53.397
[slow dramatic music playing]

2301
02:36:14.001 --> 02:36:15.544
[music fades off]

2302
02:36:16.462 --> 02:36:18.172
[melancholy music fades in]

2303
02:36:33.896 --> 02:36:35.106
[gasping]

2304
02:36:37.608 --> 02:36:38.859
[car creaking]

2305
02:36:42.279 --> 02:36:43.489
[people whimpering]

2306
02:36:45.449 --> 02:36:47.201
[melancholy music playing]

2307
02:37:15.896 --> 02:37:17.398
[melancholy music continues]

2308
02:37:56.854 --> 02:37:58.522
[melancholy music continues]

2309
02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:42.274
[Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.

2310
02:38:42.441 --> 02:38:44.110
[siren wailing in distance]

2311
02:38:45.486 --> 02:38:47.363
The city is underwater.

2312
02:38:49.698 --> 02:38:51.450
The National Guard is coming.

2313
02:38:53.744 --> 02:38:55.746
Martial law is in effect...

2314
02:38:56.664 --> 02:38:58.290
but the criminal element never sleeps.

2315
02:39:01.502 --> 02:39:05.214
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant

2316
02:39:05.297 --> 02:39:07.842
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

2317
02:39:09.009 --> 02:39:12.721
I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.

2318
02:39:15.683 --> 02:39:18.811
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

2319
02:39:20.187 --> 02:39:21.564
[Bella] We will rebuild.

2320
02:39:22.189 --> 02:39:23.649
But not just our city.

2321
02:39:24.358 --> 02:39:28.571
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

2322
02:39:28.654 --> 02:39:30.740
in our elected officials,

2323
02:39:30.823 --> 02:39:32.116
in each other.

2324
02:39:32.908 --> 02:39:36.245
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

2325
02:39:36.412 --> 02:39:37.371
[woman speaks indistinctly]

2326
02:39:37.621 --> 02:39:38.914
[helicopter blades whirring]

2327
02:39:40.583 --> 02:39:42.251
[Bruce] I'm starting to see now.

2328
02:39:43.711 --> 02:39:45.880
I have had an effect here...

2329
02:39:47.965 --> 02:39:49.884
but not the one I intended.

2330
02:39:52.261 --> 02:39:55.306
Vengeance won't change the past,

2331
02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:59.018
mine or anyone else's.

2332
02:40:01.437 --> 02:40:03.481
I have to become more.

2333
02:40:06.567 --> 02:40:08.194
People need hope.

2334
02:40:09.403 --> 02:40:11.614
To know someone's out there for them.

2335
02:40:15.409 --> 02:40:17.078
The city's angry,

2336
02:40:17.995 --> 02:40:19.371
scarred,

2337
02:40:20.289 --> 02:40:21.540
like me.

2338
02:40:23.667 --> 02:40:25.753
Our scars can destroy us.

2339
02:40:27.129 --> 02:40:29.840
Even after
the physical wounds have healed.

2340
02:40:31.467 --> 02:40:33.219
But if we survive them,

2341
02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.597
they can transform us.

2342
02:40:38.474 --> 02:40:40.392
They can give us the power

2343
02:40:41.352 --> 02:40:42.853
to endure...

2344
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:46.357
and the strength to fight.

2345
02:40:49.276 --> 02:40:51.445
[reporter]
We are live. As you can see,

2346
02:40:51.529 --> 02:40:54.323
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden

2347
02:40:54.407 --> 02:40:55.991
helping to save the lives

2348
02:40:56.075 --> 02:40:57.701
- of hundreds of victims.
- [Riddler moaning]

2349
02:40:57.785 --> 02:41:00.788
And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,

2350
02:41:00.871 --> 02:41:03.416
a mysterious masked man emerges,

2351
02:41:03.499 --> 02:41:05.835
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

2352
02:41:05.918 --> 02:41:08.379
[man] Isn't that just terrible?

2353
02:41:09.755 --> 02:41:11.674
Him...

2354
02:41:11.757 --> 02:41:14.635
raining on your parade like that?

2355
02:41:14.802 --> 02:41:15.928
[tutting]

2356
02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:22.351
What is it they say?

2357
02:41:23.519 --> 02:41:25.688
"One day you're on top,

2358
02:41:27.231 --> 02:41:28.899
the next...

2359
02:41:30.276 --> 02:41:32.194
you're a clown."

2360
02:41:32.862 --> 02:41:34.238
[exhales ruefully]

2361
02:41:34.572 --> 02:41:35.740
Well,

2362
02:41:37.533 --> 02:41:40.369
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

2363
02:41:40.578 --> 02:41:41.662
[Riddler weeping]

2364
02:41:42.663 --> 02:41:45.332
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2365
02:41:46.625 --> 02:41:48.461
You did so well.

2366
02:41:52.965 --> 02:41:53.966
And you know,

2367
02:41:55.634 --> 02:41:58.846
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2368
02:42:08.898 --> 02:42:10.274
[Riddler] Who are you?

2369
02:42:10.816 --> 02:42:13.235
[man] Well, that's the question,

2370
02:42:14.487 --> 02:42:15.654
isn't it?

2371
02:42:18.574 --> 02:42:20.951
Riddle me this...

2372
02:42:23.412 --> 02:42:25.539
"The less of them you have,

2373
02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:30.127
the more one is worth."

2374
02:42:35.549 --> 02:42:37.301
A friend.

2375
02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:42.848
[laughing maniacally]

2376
02:42:48.813 --> 02:42:51.023
[both laughing maniacally]

2377
02:43:03.536 --> 02:43:04.537
- [Batman] You're leaving.
- [gasps]

2378
02:43:05.454 --> 02:43:06.539
[Selina] Jesus.

2379
02:43:08.290 --> 02:43:09.875
Don't you ever just say hello?

2380
02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:13.379
[cat meows]

2381
02:43:14.964 --> 02:43:16.382
Where will you go?

2382
02:43:17.883 --> 02:43:20.302
I don't know. Upstate.

2383
02:43:20.719 --> 02:43:22.430
Bludhaven, maybe.

2384
02:43:23.305 --> 02:43:24.306
Why?

2385
02:43:25.516 --> 02:43:26.725
You asking me to stay?

2386
02:43:33.774 --> 02:43:35.901
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2387
02:43:36.318 --> 02:43:38.654
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

2388
02:43:38.738 --> 02:43:40.656
There's gonna be a power grab.

2389
02:43:42.283 --> 02:43:43.409
It'll be bloody.

2390
02:43:44.034 --> 02:43:45.244
I know.

2391
02:43:46.787 --> 02:43:47.872
But the city can change.

2392
02:43:47.955 --> 02:43:49.206
It won't.

2393
02:43:50.332 --> 02:43:51.333
I have to try.

2394
02:43:51.417 --> 02:43:53.210
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

2395
02:43:55.504 --> 02:43:56.630
Listen.

2396
02:43:59.049 --> 02:44:00.301
Why don't you come with me?

2397
02:44:01.260 --> 02:44:02.762
Get into some trouble.

2398
02:44:03.512 --> 02:44:07.016
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

2399
02:44:07.683 --> 02:44:09.310
The bat and the cat.

2400
02:44:10.811 --> 02:44:12.480
It's got a nice ring.

2401
02:44:24.075 --> 02:44:25.117
[scoffs]

2402
02:44:25.826 --> 02:44:27.244
Who am I kidding?

2403
02:44:28.704 --> 02:44:30.831
You're already spoken for.

2404
02:44:32.750 --> 02:44:34.627
[soft music playing]

2405
02:44:42.718 --> 02:44:44.136
You should go.

2406
02:44:52.478 --> 02:44:53.479
Selina...

2407
02:44:57.566 --> 02:44:59.235
Take care of yourself.

2408
02:45:11.038 --> 02:45:12.164
[engine starts]
