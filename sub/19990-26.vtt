- Gee, Larry, you've really
let yourself go.

19:00.071 --> 19:01.036
- With all this paperwork,

19:01.038 --> 19:03.439
I haven't had any time
to do my crunches.

19:03.441 --> 19:06.041
The only thing I've been
crunching is numbers.

19:06.043 --> 19:09.145
But I'm gonna get back in shape.
You'll see.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.080
- Yeah, Larry, sure you will.

19:11.082 --> 19:13.616
- SpongeBob,
tell me the truth.

19:13.618 --> 19:15.851
Do I have a potbelly?

19:15.853 --> 19:19.088
- I--no, Larry,
don't be silly.

19:19.090 --> 19:22.424
You don't have a potbelly.

19:22.426 --> 19:23.125
- Ugh.

19:23.127 --> 19:27.563
See you in exercise class,
I guess.

19:27.565 --> 19:31.000
[sobbing]

19:31.002 --> 19:32.568
- Oh, boy!
Free soup!

19:32.570 --> 19:36.071
[slurps]
Little heavy on the salt.

19:36.073 --> 19:37.940
[all muttering]

19:37.942 --> 19:40.075
- Oh, he'll be here.
Don't worry.

19:40.077 --> 19:42.611
Larry made me
the man I am today.

19:42.613 --> 19:43.846
- Oh, look at that.
- Oh, wow.

19:43.848 --> 19:46.782
- He taught me
just do stuff you always do

19:46.784 --> 19:48.517
but do it on your back.

19:48.519 --> 19:49.985
Laugh on your back.

19:49.987 --> 19:52.555
[laughing]

19:52.557 --> 19:55.157
[all laughing]

19:55.159 --> 19:58.127
Walk on your back.

19:58.129 --> 19:59.795
[all grunting]

19:59.797 --> 20:02.464
And don't forget,
always be hydrating.

20:02.466 --> 20:05.801
That means
drink plenty of water.

20:05.803 --> 20:07.736
all:
Ah.

20:07.738 --> 20:09.438
- I hope Larry's okay.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.339
While we're waiting,

20:10.341 --> 20:13.175
I guess we can ride bicycles
on our backs.

20:13.177 --> 20:17.046
[all grunting and groaning]

20:17.781 --> 20:21.650
- Hmm.
[moaning]

20:22.652 --> 20:26.121
- Hey, Larry, thanks for
all the free steam.

20:26.123 --> 20:27.890
[laughs]
Sucker.

20:27.892 --> 20:30.159
- [sighs]

20:31.962 --> 20:35.531
[groaning]

20:38.902 --> 20:42.204
Oh, what's the use?

20:44.574 --> 20:45.708
[breathing heavily]

20:45.710 --> 20:48.944
Ah, who am I kidding?

20:48.946 --> 20:50.679
- You wanted to see me, sir?

20:50.681 --> 20:54.216
- Yeah, look, uh,
you're obviously

20:54.218 --> 20:56.585
the alpha male
at the gym now,

20:56.587 --> 20:59.154
and I'm just a shell
of my former self.

20:59.156 --> 21:00.256
- I hear ya, Larry.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.558
I just want to get back
to the Krusty--

21:02.560 --> 21:03.926
- I need you
to take over.

21:03.928 --> 21:05.894
You're a natural leader,
SpongeBob.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.197
You should be in charge
of the fun stuff

21:08.199 --> 21:09.932
while I sit here
in the reception area

21:09.934 --> 21:12.935
slowly getting fatter
and paler until I die.

21:12.937 --> 21:14.737
- It sounds great.

21:14.739 --> 21:15.671
- [crying]

21:15.673 --> 21:17.640
- Oh, Larry, look at me.

21:17.642 --> 21:20.976
I'm too big
to work the grill anymore.

21:20.978 --> 21:22.044
That makes me sad.

21:22.046 --> 21:25.047
- Come over here
and give me a bro hug.

21:25.049 --> 21:26.048
- You mean a "brug"?

21:26.050 --> 21:27.883
- I don't wanna
call it that.

21:27.885 --> 21:29.285
- Here's to our new lives.

21:29.287 --> 21:32.821
Our terrible,
terrible, new lives.

21:32.823 --> 21:36.625
[both crying]

21:36.627 --> 21:38.060
Oh, whoa, what happened?

21:38.062 --> 21:40.929
- Dude, you were
just over hydrated.

21:40.931 --> 21:42.865
Those weren't real muscles.

21:42.867 --> 21:43.999
They were water muscles.

21:44.001 --> 21:46.535
- Larry, your "brug"
was so super strong,

21:46.537 --> 21:48.904
it took the water muscles
right out of me.

21:48.906 --> 21:50.039
- Don't say "brug."

21:50.041 --> 21:52.608
- [laughs]
Brug.

21:52.610 --> 21:56.011
[both laughing]

21:58.581 --> 22:02.051
- SpongeBob, laughing on my back
was just what I needed.

22:02.053 --> 22:04.687
You're a pretty good
instructor after all.

22:04.689 --> 22:09.625
Oh, boy, the way you laugh
really gets on my nerves.

22:09.627 --> 22:11.627
- [laughing]

22:11.629 --> 22:14.596
<i>- The very next evening...</i>

22:15.265 --> 22:18.033
- [humming]

22:18.035 --> 22:21.870
- Well, that was the last
customer, SpongeBob.

22:22.272 --> 22:23.339
- Oh, what a great day.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.708
- And you know why
it was a great day?

22:25.710 --> 22:29.278
Because Krabs never even
showed up.

22:30.347 --> 22:32.948
- Huh?
[sniffing]

22:32.950 --> 22:34.583
What is that smell?

22:34.585 --> 22:38.787
Mr. Krabs, how long
have you been in there?

22:39.856 --> 22:40.923
- I think I'm done.

22:40.925 --> 22:44.159
Would you mind rubbing
a little butter on me?
