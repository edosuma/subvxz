WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.202
- I got her!
- Help me, please!

00:03.204 --> 00:04.636
Oh, god.
[screaming]

00:04.638 --> 00:06.405
- karra!
- Hey, hey!

00:06.407 --> 00:07.862
<i> - I think it was arson.</i>

00:07.863 --> 00:09.318
<i> - Now you saw the husband</i>
<i> in the fire.</i>

00:09.319 --> 00:10.774
Anything suspicious there?
- I don't think he did it.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.078
- Yes, he did.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.547
- This is james, my stepson.
- How's he doing?

00:15.549 --> 00:18.350
- Talks to me in 140 characters
if he talks to me at all.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.685
James.
What are you doing here?

00:19.687 --> 00:23.188
- You surprised me
with that text.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.624
- Do you want to ask me out?
- Can I buy you a drink?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.726
- Yes, you may.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.501
[knocking]

00:38.739 --> 00:41.607
- hey there.
- Hi.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.709
Um...

00:45.646 --> 00:49.782
I...Am a good girl.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.217
- Okay.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.319
- [chuckles]

01:01.796 --> 01:05.197
I say my prayers
every night.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.333
I-I give a dollar every day
to a homeless guy

01:08.335 --> 01:09.802
on the off ramp.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.370
- That's very generous.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.739
- I didn't kiss a boy
for real

01:13.741 --> 01:15.607
until I was 17.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.776
- Well, that's one lucky guy.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.213
- And sex...
- Waiting till you get married.

01:21.215 --> 01:24.316
- No.
No chance in hell.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.120
- Whoa.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.222
[glass shattering]

01:41.469 --> 01:44.603
- [heavy breathing]

01:44.605 --> 01:46.839
I sang in the church choir too.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.141
- Hallelujah to that.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.654
- I really like you.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.756
- And I really like you too.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.831
- [laughing]

02:12.833 --> 02:15.300
so, uh, how old are you now,
james?

02:15.302 --> 02:18.804
- Uh, 17.
- Never too early.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.439
- For what?

02:20.441 --> 02:22.875
- Thinking about the cfd.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.776
- Uh, I-I don't know
about that.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.479
- Tom, go easy on him.
What did you know at 17?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.282
- That I wanted to be
a firefighter. You?

02:30.284 --> 02:34.153
- Same damn thing.
[chuckles]

02:34.155 --> 02:35.854
- friends like
your father here--

02:35.856 --> 02:37.890
you're damn right I'm going
to call him your father--

02:37.892 --> 02:39.725
one in a million.

02:39.727 --> 02:43.428
But with the cfd,
there's a million of us.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.164
Best damn stock there is.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.367
- Yeah. I guess I never
had anything like that.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.702
- Well, it's right here
in front of you, kid.

02:50.704 --> 02:55.908
[chuckles]
so, speaking about good stock,

02:55.910 --> 02:58.877
we gonna talk
about new york or not?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.346
- I got connie working on it.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.448
- Johnny salka doesn't retire
every day.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.850
You should be there.

03:04.852 --> 03:08.253
- Told you I'm working on it.
- Wallace...

03:08.255 --> 03:10.622
You gotta face this thing
head on, buddy.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.724
- I understand.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.329
But not now, okay?

03:25.506 --> 03:29.341
Hey, uh, listen up.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.377
- Holy moses. Ah!
James?

03:32.379 --> 03:35.614
The last time I saw you, you
were just a little ankle biter.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.250
- Hey, everybody,
this is my stepson james.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.751
He's going to spend
a couple of shifts with us,

03:39.753 --> 03:43.622
see if the job
is right for him.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.457
Cruz, find james a bunk,
please?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.759
- Absolutely, chief.
Follow me.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.662
- Wow, look at him.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.665
- Yep, we're old.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.301
- Speak for yourself.
I'm just hitting my stride.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.370
- Ah.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.771
By "hitting your stride"

03:59.773 --> 04:01.840
you mean pulling a hamstring,
right?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.242
- I heard through the grapevine

04:03.244 --> 04:04.643
that my name came up
for promotion.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.678
- You're getting promoted?
- What? Wait, no, I didn't--

04:06.680 --> 04:08.413
- herrmann!
- You're kidding.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.515
- All right.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.517
Look, there's still plenty
of time

04:12.519 --> 04:14.419
for the big shots
to change their mind.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.438
They always do.

04:16.439 --> 04:18.456
- Maybe your lieutenant could
put in a good word for you.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.659
- Honestly, I've never seen
herrmann in action.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.828
- I fill in for you
all the time.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.529
- How about this?

04:24.531 --> 04:26.331
You take the helm at 81
for the shift.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.433
I'll shadow,
get a feel for your style.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.037
We'll go from there.
- You're on.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.339
- Hey, casey,
can I talk to you a sec?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.513
That was darin whitney.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.782
Guy who lost his wife
in the fire last week.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.784
He called to say
ofi's all over him.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.487
Asking about chemicals
on his clothes.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.788
- That's their job.
- Last I heard,

04:49.790 --> 04:50.956
they weren't going
to pursue him.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.793
- Maybe they're tying up
loose ends.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.896
<i> - Truck 81, ambo 61,</i>
<i> person injured from fall.</i>

04:57.898 --> 05:01.833
<i> 23423 north lasalle street.</i>

05:01.835 --> 05:03.935
- All you, lieutenant.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.748
- Hey,
it's my daughter, jessie.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.350
She was playing on the roof
with her friends

05:18.352 --> 05:20.319
and feel through the skylight.
- All right, otis, kidd,

05:20.321 --> 05:22.020
oxygen, jump bag,
and backboard.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.455
- Look, I told her not
to mess around up there.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.725
- All right.
Take us to her.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.828
- [sobbing]

05:32.733 --> 05:33.932
- she's bleeding a lot.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.067
I've been trying
to keep her talking.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.535
- Okay. It's okay.
You did good.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.804
Ambo 61, this is truck 81.

05:38.806 --> 05:42.007
I got a girl fell through
a skylight, two story home.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.509
She's got a piece of glass
stuck in her bread basket.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.677
<i> She's bleeding pretty bad.</i>

05:45.679 --> 05:47.412
- Roger that.
We're almost there.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.047
It's probably better
to take sedgwick.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.551
[siren blaring]

05:52.553 --> 05:54.653
- come on.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.994
Ugh. Sirens don't mean
a thing to anyone anymore.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.098
- Dawson, watch out!
- Ahh!

06:21.415 --> 06:22.631
.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.848
- No, no, no, no.
61 to main.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.418
We had an accident
with a pedestrian.

06:26.420 --> 06:30.555
<i> - 61, repeat your last.</i>
<i> - I hit a pedestrian.</i>

06:30.557 --> 06:32.524
<i> It looks like</i>
<i> he's still alive. Standby.</i>

06:32.526 --> 06:34.426
- Everyone,
head in the game.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.094
<i>- 61, companies are on the way.</i>

06:36.096 --> 06:39.631
- Mouch, we need the wizzer.
- Coming up.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.134
- 81 to main,
copy that last transmission.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.670
We still need an ambo at
our location, fast as possible.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.773
<i> - Copy, truck 81.</i>
<i> Working on it.</i>

06:47.775 --> 06:49.875
- Working on it.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.679
- How is he?
- He's only responding to pain.

06:54.681 --> 06:58.784
- Head injury.
- Okay, one, two, three.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.953
- Main, patient's a trauma.
We need a transport now.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.990
<i> - Copy 61. Go ahead and then</i>
<i> hold at chicago med</i>

07:04.992 --> 07:08.193
<i> for a sobriety test.</i>

07:08.195 --> 07:11.496
- It's just protocol.
You have nothing to worry about.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.536
[whirring]
- [crying]

07:23.010 --> 07:25.010
- all right, we're good.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.480
- 81 to main, our girl's ready
to roll. Where's her ride?

07:28.482 --> 07:31.650
<i> - Ambo 97 is rerouting</i>
<i>from wrigleyville. Ten minutes.</i>

07:31.652 --> 07:34.820
- Gotta be kidding.
- She has to wait?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.555
- No.
Clean out the rig.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.223
We're going to get her
to med ourselves.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.825
- We--we're not cleared
to transport.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.026
She needs a sterile environment.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.028
- Move, otis.
You got an order.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.095
- Copy, lieutenant.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.198
- All right, let's get her up.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.784
- Clean.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.886
- Urine too.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.256
We're not taking any chances.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.061
- Fill it up.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.838
- Hey.
- Kid?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.808
- Name's jessie winkler,
fell 20 feet through a skylight.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.744
On scene for 20 minutes,
no available ambo.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.146
Blood pressure is 70 palp.
- She's lost a lot of blood.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.648
- All right,
take her to trauma 2.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.716
You guys probably
saved her life

08:37.718 --> 08:39.184
by bringing her here
yourselves.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.651
But I'm still going to need
that run sheet, though,

08:40.654 --> 08:41.820
to give to goodwin, all right?
- Yeah.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.021
- All right.
- I can handle it.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.090
- Nah, nah, nah. I got it.
I made the call.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.591
I can do the rundown, all right?
- Okay.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.828
- Leaders lead, right?
- Yeah.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.930
Brett, where's gabby?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.766
- She's in with chief hatcher.
Victim's in a coma.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.702
- I'm gonna sit in with her.
- Lieutenant, you can't.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.171
Gotta be a union rep.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.541
- Okay. Go ahead.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.111
Is she okay?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.013
- She's in shock.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.149
I mean, the guy came out
of nowhere.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.284
There was nothing she could
have done to avoid him.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.821
- And how fast were you going
when the pedestrian appeared?

09:16.823 --> 09:19.724
- Uh, I'd say about 20, 25.

09:19.726 --> 09:24.262
- Which?
20 or 25?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.765
- Uh, closer to 20.
- Is there a difference?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.233
- I need to get
the facts straight.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.968
If you're unclear, presumption
will be that you didn't--

09:29.970 --> 09:32.604
- 20 miles per hour last time
I looked at the speedometer,

09:32.606 --> 09:34.773
crossing larabee
in the left-most lane.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.875
That specific enough?
- Okay, dawson,

09:36.877 --> 09:38.977
let's take it down a notch.
I'm here for you.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.812
I'm on your side here.
- No, you wanted to be specific.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.848
Let's be specific.
- Dawson--

09:42.849 --> 09:44.883
- I had the lights and sirens on
and I was on the horn.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.002
Guy steps in the middle
of the road

09:47.003 --> 09:49.120
not ten feet in front of me
from behind the cover of a van.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.822
The time between him stepping
in the road

09:50.824 --> 09:53.158
and me slamming on my brakes
was about a second,

09:53.160 --> 09:58.096
but I saw the look in his eyes.
They were blue.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.032
Am I wrong?
[knocking]

10:01.034 --> 10:03.134
- chief, a word.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.213
- You okay?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.251
- It was unavoidable.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.990
- What in the hell was that?
- Wallace--

10:24.992 --> 10:26.791
- you barely wait
for a union rep

10:26.793 --> 10:27.993
before you decide
to interrogate?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.061
- It's a field report.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.128
I have a responsibility
to fill this out--

10:30.130 --> 10:33.164
- and I am her chief.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.000
- There's a comatose man
in the e.D.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.768
Whose lawyer has already
called the department,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.370
threatening a suit.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.372
- So what you're saying is

10:40.373 --> 10:42.373
the department doesn't have
her back?

10:42.376 --> 10:46.678
- If it were me,
I'd be getting outside counsel.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.989
- Have you been with him?
Who was with him? You?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.357
Thank you.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.260
Oh, god, dad...
What happened?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.362
Is he all right?

11:22.282 --> 11:23.648
.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.015
- There she is.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.118
- Hey. Come here.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.857
Are you all right?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.994
- Uh, I feel like
I should say yes.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.163
- How's the guy?

11:38.165 --> 11:41.833
- Critical.
That's all I know.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.935
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.770
Don't let hatcher
rattle your cage, all right?

11:45.772 --> 11:47.138
We all know
you're in the right.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.241
- I'll call the union.
Rally support.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.447
- Thanks, everyone.
Excuse me.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.493
- How's she?

12:08.495 --> 12:11.162
- Shaken.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.265
- Truth always comes out
for the innocent though, right?

12:16.737 --> 12:18.870
- How about you just come out
and say what you want to say?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.739
- I know you called ofi
and got them to extend

12:20.741 --> 12:22.307
their investigation.
- I'm not hiding that.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.210
- This is a grieving husband.
I saw it with my own eyes.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.945
I don't know what it's going
to take to make you see that.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.047
- The truth.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.256
<i>- You let her down and you fail</i>
<i> every first responder</i>

12:38.258 --> 12:41.359
<i> in this city!</i>
<i> Is that how we treat our own?</i>

12:45.899 --> 12:49.000
Then just do it.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.873
Look, uh,
day took a turn.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.875
- It's okay.
I understand.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.443
- Chief,
I've been treading water

12:58.445 --> 13:00.111
on this new york trip
all day--

13:00.113 --> 13:01.546
- cancel it.
- Really, chief--

13:01.548 --> 13:03.848
- connie, please.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.487
Send my regrets.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.556
Will you do me a favor?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.358
You find joe cruz.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.461
You tell him I said to show you
some ladder drills.

13:16.463 --> 13:21.065
- Yeah.
Sure.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.169
- Chief, there's some lawyer
out here taking pictures.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.475
- Hold on.
That's been there for months.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.343
- Dawson--
- no, that--that was, uh,

13:32.345 --> 13:37.382
that was first watch from, uh,
a warehouse fire six months ago.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.885
Look, you don't have to do this.
If we could just--

13:40.887 --> 13:42.387
if we could just talk,
I can tell you what happened

13:42.389 --> 13:45.023
with your father.
- Sweetheart, do me a favor.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.559
Don't address my client.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.060
- What did you just call me?

13:49.062 --> 13:51.162
- What's going on here?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.464
- Oh.
Scott powers.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.433
I'm the attorney
for russell hayes,

13:55.435 --> 13:57.068
the son of the man--
- I know who you are.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.903
Why are you here?

13:58.905 --> 14:02.073
- It's our notification
of intent to sue.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.111
We'll be chatting soon.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.291
- He is suggesting 5 million
in damages against the cfd.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.894
This is ridiculous.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.996
- Plus another million
from me personally.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.436
- The department
has deep pockets.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.037
Let them take the lead.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.306
They'll get the best settlement
they can.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.307
- So you want me to take
responsibility

14:36.309 --> 14:38.443
for something
I couldn't avoid?

14:38.444 --> 14:40.578
- Of course not, but I don't
want you to go all gabby dawson

14:40.580 --> 14:42.046
and make things worse
for yourself.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.549
- When have I ever done that?

14:44.551 --> 14:49.921
Okay, okay.
Those times were warranted.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.923
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.126
- Just listen.
Be strong.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.128
We'll get through this.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.230
[phone ringing]

14:59.232 --> 15:01.499
- it's antonio.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.435
Hello?

15:04.437 --> 15:10.174
- Oh, hey, uh, since you're
sleeping in gen-pop tonight.

15:10.176 --> 15:14.145
- Much obliged.
- Yeah.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.682
Hey.
- Casey?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.984
Can I see you in my office?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.156
Is she okay?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.991
- Uh, still waiting to see

15:26.993 --> 15:28.459
if the white shirts
are gonna have her back.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.163
- Really?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.265
Um.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.008
Gotta get into character,
right?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.311
- Right.
- All right.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.446
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.682
- Um, this report,

15:50.684 --> 15:54.953
when they say "entity"--

15:54.955 --> 15:57.989
- they mean company 81.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.491
- The heck don't they
say that then?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.393
- You get promoted
and before you know it

16:02.395 --> 16:03.661
you'll be a white shirt
yourself.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.964
It ain't all trophies
and bald eagles.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.206
- All right.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.543
Yeah, let me know.
I love you. Bye.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.211
- Hey, there you are. I wanted
to see how you were doing.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.113
- That was antonio.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.681
- Oh.
Oh, okay.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.616
- He said to say hello.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.520
- Oh. That's--
that's nice of him.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.622
- You slept with him.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.228
Please.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.997
As much as I want to stay
out of the middle of you two,

16:38.999 --> 16:42.367
I also just want to get my mind
off of all this other junk.

16:42.369 --> 16:47.472
- Um, uh, well, I-I may have
knocked on his door last night.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.008
- [chuckles]
I knew it.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.110
- It was perfect.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.245
He's so...Caring.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.447
And, oh, his touch
makes my body ti--

16:56.449 --> 16:58.349
- ah! Okay, wait.
I was wrong.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.085
Thought I could handle it.
I can't.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.421
- I am here for you
either way.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.523
- I know.
Thank you.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.633
- You want to see me?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.635
- Ofi called.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.337
They confirmed the use
of an accelerant

17:19.339 --> 17:21.072
in darin whitney's home.

17:21.074 --> 17:24.509
- Okay, so an accelerant
was used.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.577
He was still nowhere near the
house when the fire was started.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.745
- What about a timing device?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.147
- Where's the timing device,
casey?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.665
No one found anything.

17:30.666 --> 17:32.182
- We both know that fire
didn't start itself.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.184
- Why don't you just give it
a rest?

17:33.186 --> 17:36.220
- Okay, enough.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.590
Let me be clear. You are both
leaders in this house.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.627
I need you to act like it,
starting yesterday.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.496
By next shift I want
a final statement on my desk

17:45.498 --> 17:47.165
with both your signatures.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.435
It'll go to the ofi
and that will be the end of it.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.537
Understood?

18:00.547 --> 18:01.712
Dismissed.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.552
.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.753
- And the bulldicky
just keeps piling on.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.756
So now I'm learning
that they make lieutenants

18:11.758 --> 18:14.292
go through
"sensitivity training."

18:14.294 --> 18:16.794
- why do you want this anyway?

18:16.796 --> 18:20.231
- 'cause I always thought
I was supposed to.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.267
And 'cause I'm an idiot.
[phone ringing]

18:23.269 --> 18:25.369
hang on.

18:25.371 --> 18:28.773
Christopher herrmann.
He does?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.209
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll be there.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.745
Of course, yeah.
Uh, wait, um...

18:34.747 --> 18:36.581
Was he smiling
when he said that?

18:36.583 --> 18:40.318
- [chuckles]

18:40.320 --> 18:42.587
- yeah, that's great.
Thank you so much.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.522
All right, bye.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.658
Wow. Chief walker wants to see
me tomorrow.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.661
- Must be good news.
- Eh, don't jinx it.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.230
Hey.
- Hey.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.867
Keep your hands
on that ladder, james.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.169
[sighs]

19:02.642 --> 19:05.243
- how's he looking?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.245
- Rough.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.816
Truthfully, chief, I think he'd
rather be anywhere but here.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.918
- Thanks.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.822
Okay, that's enough
for the day.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.924
Get changed now.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.540
- You need to hear this.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.375
- Victim has a rocky past.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.510
Unemployed since
the steel mills went bust.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.878
He has a record too.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.882
Court ordered treatment
for attempted suicide.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.918
- You think he walked
into the street on purpose?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.787
- Well, guy's been in the valley
a few times.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.455
Pills, blades.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.291
- Does lawyer powers
know his history?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.760
- Does he care? It's never been
about the truth with that guy.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.762
It's a paycheck.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.763
Anything that takes fault off
the city, he's not interested.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.199
- Well, what about the son?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.567
- Dad left when he was ten.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.235
The son sued
for unpaid child support

20:04.237 --> 20:06.404
when he turned 18.
Blood from a stone.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.906
His name's not listed on any of
the victim's treatment forms

20:08.908 --> 20:10.324
over the years.

20:10.325 --> 20:11.741
- So how did he find out
about the accident?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.945
- Well, my guess?
Powers dug him up.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.647
Can't sue the city
without a plaintiff.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.583
- Is that legal?

20:18.585 --> 20:19.650
- I doubt he's losing sleep
over the particulars.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.953
[phone chimes]
severide.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.522
I'm supposed to meet him
at the arson site.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.358
- Go ahead. Give him hell.
- Nothing but.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.461
I'm gonna fight this to the end.
Thank you.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.001
Hey.
- Hey.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.304
- Found anything yet?
- Not much.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.914
The city camera showed
the husband at the restaurant

20:49.916 --> 20:51.983
when the blaze started.

20:51.985 --> 20:55.286
Accelerated fire would have
engulfed this entire place

20:55.288 --> 20:57.355
in minutes.
Couldn't have been him.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.657
- Unless there was a fuse.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.425
Some way he could
delay the burn,

21:01.427 --> 21:04.695
give him time
to set up an alibi.

21:04.697 --> 21:08.366
Waste basket was a seat,
right?

21:08.368 --> 21:11.469
- No.
Right there.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.974
Charring?

21:16.976 --> 21:19.277
That's where it started.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.351
- Well, this--

21:27.353 --> 21:29.387
this ash.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.923
Kindling? Sawdust?
Something else he piled up.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.060
- Maybe.
But how did he spark it?

21:36.062 --> 21:38.562
Leave the power running
and hope that it surged out?

21:38.564 --> 21:41.399
- Maybe he sabotaged
the power strip.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.668
Created a short.
- No.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.504
It would have went off as soon
as the current ran through it

21:46.506 --> 21:50.941
and he would have got caught
in the blaze.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.311
And it's--it's not like
he could have turned on

21:53.313 --> 21:55.946
the power strip
from the restaurant.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.649
Besides, even if he did
delay the burn,

21:58.651 --> 22:01.919
why go through all of that
and then run back into the fire?

22:01.921 --> 22:04.021
There's no logic to it.

22:07.593 --> 22:10.728
- Okay, fine.
I'm crazy.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.764
- Casey, I'm telling you
we have nothing.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.867
- I'm done.
Just, um, write up the report.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.740
I'll sign it.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.688
- Casey, hold up.
- What?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.825
- Come here.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.928
- What is it?

22:43.930 --> 22:45.663
- It's called homegate.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.965
It's a company that does
home automation.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.635
It's utilities, alarm systems,
climate control.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.739
Whole thing's controlled
by an app on your phone.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.549
Hold this.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.040
- That an internet cable?

23:33.946 --> 23:36.046
- Son of a bitch.

23:40.887 --> 23:41.085
.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.988
- [breathing rapidly]

23:46.659 --> 23:48.159
- what is that, lamaze?

23:48.161 --> 23:49.693
- You told me to relax
and breathe.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.797
Cindy and I went through this
five times.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.201
[breathing rapidly]

23:57.203 --> 24:01.005
- listen.
When you make your move,

24:01.007 --> 24:05.009
any chance you'd have the pull
to take me with you?

24:05.011 --> 24:07.678
- You'd leave 51?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.781
- You and me been riding
together a long time.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.787
- He's ready for you.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.825
- [exasperated sigh]

24:20.827 --> 24:22.927
[exhales sharply]

24:28.000 --> 24:30.234
- thanks for waiting,
herrmann.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.938
We've been giving your promotion
serious consideration.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.073
However, if we're going
to move forward,

24:36.075 --> 24:38.209
we need to clear the air.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.110
- About?

24:40.112 --> 24:42.246
- Is this your name
on this run sheet?

24:42.248 --> 24:45.483
- Yeah.
I was acting lieutenant on 81.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.368
A girl was bleeding.

24:47.369 --> 24:49.252
She needed to get
to the hospital asap.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.988
- I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.824
- Nevertheless,
protocols are protocols.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.926
So I'm gonna need you
to write a formal statement

24:55.928 --> 24:59.029
taking liability.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.632
- What--and what does that mean?

25:01.634 --> 25:04.001
- Short suspension.
Dock in pay.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.636
- Even though
I did the right thing?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.605
- Taking the hit
is part of the job.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.839
- Taking the hit.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.675
Oh, kinda like what
gabby dawson is doing, hmm?

25:11.677 --> 25:14.111
- Excuse me?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.980
- Are you guys
gonna have her back?

25:15.982 --> 25:18.082
- It's an open investigation,
herrmann.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.017
- Oh, how is that
being a leader?

25:20.019 --> 25:23.521
- You should probably consider
your next words very carefully

25:23.523 --> 25:26.056
if you're still thinking
of making lieutenant.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.025
- The funny thing is,
up until now

25:28.027 --> 25:29.827
my job has been
pretty straightforward.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.996
You know, kick in a door,
save a life.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.598
There's been
no inventory requests,

25:34.600 --> 25:36.033
no status reports,

25:36.035 --> 25:39.637
and definitely no statements
of liability.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.072
And there has been
no sensitivity crap

25:42.074 --> 25:44.241
just in case
I say something stupid,

25:44.243 --> 25:47.945
which I am definitely
not gonna do right now!

25:47.947 --> 25:50.814
And no paper white shirts
who are too jelly spined

25:50.816 --> 25:52.249
<i> too stand up for their own!</i>

25:52.251 --> 25:54.435
<i> You know what?</i>
<i> And another thing.</i>

25:54.436 --> 25:56.620
<i> I got a bone to pick with you</i>
<i> about the amount of polyester</i>

25:56.622 --> 25:57.988
<i> in our dress blues.</i>

25:57.990 --> 26:00.124
<i> Every time that I go</i>
<i> to a formal event,</i>

26:00.126 --> 26:03.260
<i> I end up with a rash</i>
<i> the size of lake michigan.</i>

26:09.602 --> 26:11.802
- Hey, darin.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.003
Can we come in?

26:13.005 --> 26:16.106
- Yeah.
Absolutely.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.878
Something wrong?

26:24.016 --> 26:26.183
- You headed out?

26:26.185 --> 26:29.687
- Cousin up in rockford's
got an extra bed.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.790
I need a change of scenery.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.230
- We know, darin.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.105
- If we looked at your phone

26:48.107 --> 26:49.940
we'd find an app that could
activate this outlet

26:49.942 --> 26:51.308
from anywhere in the world,
am I right?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.277
- Look, I'm--

26:53.278 --> 26:55.245
- we already contacted homegate
to confirm your usage.

26:55.247 --> 26:59.249
It's time stamped.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.986
- I can't help you anymore.

27:01.988 --> 27:06.190
- It's not what you think.

27:06.192 --> 27:09.860
I was trying
to bail us out.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.997
I have problems.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.300
Debts.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.402
But I knew
she'd never go for it.

27:18.404 --> 27:22.206
She was supposed to be
at her sister's.

27:22.208 --> 27:26.343
I didn't know she'd come home.
I didn't know.

27:26.345 --> 27:31.115
I saw her car out front
and by then

27:31.117 --> 27:34.018
the whole house
was going up.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.187
I raced inside.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.289
You saw me.

27:41.727 --> 27:46.296
- Darin whitney, you have
the right to remain silent.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.998
Anything you say

27:48.000 --> 27:49.800
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.886
You have the right
to an attorney.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.971
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.250
- Uh, james.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.755
- How's he doing?

28:11.757 --> 28:13.090
- I really don't know.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.126
I should, but...
- Eh.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.328
- Hey, I heard
from chief walker.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.963
- Ah, boy.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.265
- He thinks you're
temperamentally unfit

28:21.267 --> 28:23.000
for command.

28:23.002 --> 28:27.004
- Sounds about right.
- What did you do this time?

28:27.006 --> 28:29.473
- Spoke the truth.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.910
- Not always a wise choice.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.745
- I know.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.915
Wise and me
are like water and oil,

28:37.917 --> 28:42.252
so I decided that the big guy
put me on this planet

28:42.254 --> 28:44.121
to swing an ax
and drag a hose,

28:44.123 --> 28:47.224
and not make
higher level decisions.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.299
Everything all right?

28:55.301 --> 28:57.000
- Been a long couple of days.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.303
- Yeah.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.139
For everybody, I'd say.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.374
[alarm sounding]

29:04.376 --> 29:07.144
<i> - truck 81, ambo 61,</i>
<i> squad 3.</i>

29:07.146 --> 29:10.247
[sirens wailing]

29:23.395 --> 29:24.778
- what do we got?

29:24.779 --> 29:26.162
- I blew a tire
and went through the wall.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.432
I didn't even see the girl
in the bike lane.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.534
- What girl?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.113
Herrmann?
- Yeah?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.082
- Grab the axel
with the tow strap.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.185
Grab a winch,
and pull the truck off.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.956
- Hey, that's gonna take time.
She's getting crushed.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.025
If we cut the fence off her,
we can get her out.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.616
- The whole truck could go.

29:56.617 --> 29:58.206
The fence is the only thing
holding it up.

29:58.207 --> 29:59.796
- Forget the winch.
We're gonna use manpower.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.099
How much space you need
to get in there and get her out?

30:02.101 --> 30:04.935
- A few inches.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.237
- We can do it.
- Go.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.573
- I'm coming around back.
- All right, kidd, prep a rope.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.308
- Yeah. Got it.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.876
- All right, squad,
help 'em out.

30:12.877 --> 30:14.443
Cruz, grab the wire cutters
just in case.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.547
I'm going in.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.156
Hey, just relax.
We're gonna get you out.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.891
- All right,
I want two lines here.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.993
Squad, truck, let's do this.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.399
Dawson, brett, a little help.
- Yeah, coming in.

30:38.170 --> 30:42.439
- One, two, three!

30:42.441 --> 30:44.541
[all grunting]

30:50.049 --> 30:51.048
- you got it!

30:51.050 --> 30:54.151
[all grunting]

30:58.257 --> 31:01.425
[all grunting]

31:07.466 --> 31:10.567
- come on,
let's get you out of here.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.570
Okay.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.144
Damn it!

31:21.146 --> 31:23.247
[all grunting]

31:25.184 --> 31:27.517
- pull!

31:27.519 --> 31:29.620
Severide,
get her out of there, now!

31:34.593 --> 31:37.160
[all grunting]
- it's going.

31:43.068 --> 31:43.267
.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.135
- Got you.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.606
- Severide!

31:49.608 --> 31:51.174
Talk to me, severide.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.277
- I'm good, I'm good.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.583
- Flip her.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.425
- Nice job, bro.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.004
- Mind waiting a bit?

32:21.006 --> 32:23.106
- No.
Do what you gotta do.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.193
- Excuse me,
you can't be in here.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.695
- I know I'm the last person
you want to talk to right now.

32:44.697 --> 32:47.531
- You need to leave.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.633
- There's something
you need to see first.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.242
Your father needs help.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.545
He needed help
before the accident.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.681
He'll need it even more
if he pulls through.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.984
- He tried to kill himself?

33:12.758 --> 33:17.327
- I did all I could
to avoid that accident, okay?

33:17.329 --> 33:20.430
I did everything
to save your father afterward.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.401
- Tom.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.270
- You're canceling?

34:00.272 --> 34:01.605
Don't blame connie.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.607
I nearly had to torture her
to get the straight story.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.742
- That's right, tom.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.045
I'm not going to new york.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.584
- How about you tell me
exactly why?

34:19.491 --> 34:21.491
- How about you mind
your own affairs?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.627
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.662
- Tom, I do not need to--

34:25.664 --> 34:29.332
- you know what I see
in your eyes, wallace?

34:29.334 --> 34:31.435
Fear.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.477
For the first time
in 30 years,

34:40.479 --> 34:43.146
I see fear
in wallace boden's eyes.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.414
- You don't know
what you see.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.516
- The hell I don't.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.368
For some day...

35:05.370 --> 35:07.471
When you're ready.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.187
- [exhales deeply]

35:27.759 --> 35:30.560
- I know you guys
love your chief.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.396
Get him to new york.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.499
He needs it.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.219
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.190
- I got something
you might want to see.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.730
[exhales deeply]

36:46.405 --> 36:48.371
September 12th.

36:48.373 --> 36:52.642
That's me, my battalion chief,
tommy vasquez,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.411
mitch sudik,
and tom colletti.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.946
- Colletti went to new york?

36:55.948 --> 36:58.115
- Yeah.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.283
He was the first one to call
and say there'd been an attack.

37:00.285 --> 37:02.986
We all just jumped in the trucks
and drove through the day.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.921
- How many went?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.691
- At least a hundred.

37:07.693 --> 37:11.494
There was hundreds more
in the weeks to come.

37:11.496 --> 37:14.598
- What was it like
when you got there?

37:17.569 --> 37:21.571
<i> It was hell.</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:25.675
<i> Dust everywhere</i>
<i> and the smell of...Emptiness.</i>

37:30.415 --> 37:33.016
<i> The colors of the world</i>
<i> were gone somehow.</i>

37:33.018 --> 37:35.318
- Wallace, that you?

37:41.893 --> 37:43.994
Been a long time, brother.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.000
Nice.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.568
<i> - So I joined up</i>
<i>with some new york firefighters</i>

37:51.570 --> 37:54.271
<i> and I started searching</i>
<i> through the rubble.</i>

37:54.273 --> 37:56.406
<i> John salka from new york,</i>
<i> colletti, and me,</i>

37:56.408 --> 37:58.608
<i> we didn't stop digging.</i>

37:58.610 --> 38:00.710
<i> No one there stopped.</i>

38:40.385 --> 38:41.851
<i> The three of us wondered aloud</i>

38:41.853 --> 38:43.653
<i> if this place</i>
<i> would ever be the same.</i>

38:43.655 --> 38:47.390
<i> We talked about the future</i>
<i> and rebuilding and rebirth,</i>

38:47.392 --> 38:50.393
<i> but I never really</i>
<i> believed in it.</i>

38:50.395 --> 38:52.495
<i> Not in those days.</i>

38:55.067 --> 38:59.869
<i> The world felt brutal,</i>
<i> ugly.</i>

38:59.871 --> 39:04.507
<i>The people who gave their lives</i>
<i> that day would never know why.</i>

39:04.509 --> 39:08.812
<i> And through all the digging</i>
<i> and the dust and the death,</i>

39:08.814 --> 39:12.749
<i> we never found a single soul.</i>

39:12.751 --> 39:17.554
<i> And I felt like I failed them.</i>

39:17.556 --> 39:20.657
<i>Firefighters don't fail people.</i>

39:24.529 --> 39:26.629
<i> A hole formed inside of me.</i>

39:35.707 --> 39:38.375
<i> Hope is hard to find</i>

39:38.377 --> 39:41.478
<i> when you lock it</i>
<i> out of your mind.</i>

39:51.656 --> 39:57.093
But maybe hope has a way
of unlocking itself.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.398
If you allow it to.

40:09.674 --> 40:12.075
[chuckles]

40:12.077 --> 40:15.078
all of this time,

40:15.080 --> 40:18.181
and the answers were right here.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.794
The future is right here.
