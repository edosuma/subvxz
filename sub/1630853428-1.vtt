22:39.892 --> 22:43.095
I hung upside down
like a fucking bat

22:43.195 --> 22:45.664
from a bunk bed for two weeks.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.733
I've been training my lower,
my lower voice

22:47.833 --> 22:49.501
so I can talk like this.
Hi, I'm Bruce.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.002
Yeah, pretty good.
It's pretty good.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.538
They'll fix it in post.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.616
I didn't even go out last night
for the finale party.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.175
Like, I'm dedicated.
The work is there.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.476
Yeah, that's not something
you should be celebrating.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.679
Why? What?
Why are you saying that?

23:00.779 --> 23:02.281
Why is everyone saying that?

23:02.380 --> 23:04.550
I'm the asshole that has
to break the news to him

23:04.650 --> 23:07.353
about that piece of shit fucking
train wreck nightmare finale?

23:07.452 --> 23:09.255
Let's just be grateful
that 15 years ago,

23:09.355 --> 23:11.757
I gave this director a handjob
at the Pluto Nash premiere,

23:11.857 --> 23:14.894
and today is the day
it pays off.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.663
I'm going to ask you a question,

23:17.763 --> 23:21.367
and I hope you answer it
better than Josh Hartnett did.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.769
Do you want to be in love

23:23.869 --> 23:26.437
or do you want to be the biggest
star in the fucking world?

23:26.538 --> 23:28.374
Because you can't have both.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.309
- Okay, um...
- This is Batman.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.077
All right,
I'll be at the meeting.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.312
- Batman!
- I got you.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.748
- The only movie that matters.
- I know.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.984
I'll be at the meeting.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.319
Fuck.

23:40.451 --> 23:41.987
That was good,
that was pretty good,

23:42.087 --> 23:45.524
Don't... why does that smell
like pussy?

23:47.192 --> 23:49.161
You're free now, little shrimp.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.538
Hey, London, London, right here!

23:50.562 --> 23:52.463
- You guys energy is all off.
- London, hey!

23:52.564 --> 23:54.934
Hey, London, yeah we just saw
Apple leaving the Everly

23:55.034 --> 23:56.068
looking all sad.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.304
- You guys good?
- London, did you cheat on Apple?

23:58.404 --> 24:00.039
Fucking move.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.510
♪ I got skeletons in my closet ♪

24:16.355 --> 24:18.357
Is that who I think it is?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.458
Oh my God, movie man.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.094
What's up, Barry?
Yo, you see Apple?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.129
Yes, she was just here
like two minutes ago.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.130
- She left?
- Yeah.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.332
Fuck!

24:26.432 --> 24:27.766
Did she say where she was going?

24:27.866 --> 24:29.386
You know what, she did.
She actually...

24:29.467 --> 24:30.569
No, are you fucking crazy?

24:30.669 --> 24:31.770
You guys never talk to me.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.439
I mean, the only reason
you know my name

24:33.539 --> 24:35.179
is because
it's on my nametag right there.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.777
B-E-R-R-Y. Berry.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.917
I don't know, Berry, I feel
like we're kind of cool.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.116
Like every time I come here,
we always have a little...

24:44.216 --> 24:45.284
- Oh, do ya?
- Something.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.685
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.253
Come here, come here.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.714
- You feel this right here?
- Yeah.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.890
- Yeah, that feels good.
- That's homie shit.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.525
That's homie shit?
We're friends now?

24:53.625 --> 24:54.660
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.896
- We can be friends.
- Yeah.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.767
One second, sir,
I am down to party.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.402
And I'm cool around celebrities.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.605
I actually frequent
the town with Andy Dick.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.074
If I don't mean to brag.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.952
- That's tight.
- The Dick calls me all the time.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.487
He's like, yo, what's up,
it's the Dick,

25:12.511 --> 25:13.511
and I'm like, What's up?

25:13.579 --> 25:16.115
You know It's Berry.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.895
Hey, do you get your hair
done at the mall?

25:19.151 --> 25:20.319
That's not necessary, sir.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.787
I get mine done at the mall.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.398
If you ever want to come
together, we could probably

25:23.422 --> 25:24.422
get a two for one.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.724
- You know, -Sick, dude.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.559
- Yeah, I'm gonna text you.
- Yeah...

25:30.496 --> 25:33.198
If you just... I just
need you to text me.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.100
Yeah.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.268
I will fuck your wife.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.569
I'ma text you right now.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.109
Yeah, okay.
Send my love to the boys.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.072
All right, I will.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.508
Send my love to the boys?

25:41.607 --> 25:43.308
- The ones right here.
- Yeah.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.010
- They heard you.
- Okay, cool.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.311
All right.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.412
Do you know who that is?

25:47.479 --> 25:49.448
That was the movie man. Get out.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.418
Hurry up. Ridiculous.

25:52.519 --> 25:55.054
Doesn't even have a handle.

25:55.154 --> 25:59.024
Oh, fuck.
He doesn't even have my number.

25:59.124 --> 26:02.394
That's so sick.
I just got dogged.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.663
Get the fuck out.
Come on, today.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.198
Very cool car, sir.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.378
Is this the one that Tiger
keeps getting repossessed?

26:09.601 --> 26:10.869
How do you know Berry?

26:10.969 --> 26:13.072
How do I know Berry?
How do you know Berry?

26:13.172 --> 26:15.574
Dude saved Fat Joe's life
like twice last year.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.010
He can snap anybody
out of a bad trip.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.110
True.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.722
What time did y'all say
that meeting was?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.281
I don't know, dude.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.184
I can't think about anything
else but Apple right now.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.686
- I fucked up.
- Let's pull up to her crib.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.826
Babe?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.762
She's not here, man.
Let's just leave.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.263
You fucking kidding me, bro?

26:38.363 --> 26:40.008
We drove all the way out
here, rush hour traffic, man.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.867
We get some fucking answers.

26:41.967 --> 26:44.603
You know, my dad had this
saying, if you breaking up,

26:44.703 --> 26:46.371
you've got to break in.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.740
- Your dad used to say that?
- What?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.018
Well, I'm pretty
sure he got it. From Aaron Paul

26:50.042 --> 26:51.410
on an episode of Breaking Bad.

26:51.511 --> 26:52.411
Pretty sure he didn't say that.

26:52.512 --> 26:53.679
No.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.747
Well, I'm pretty
sure he broke in houses

26:55.848 --> 26:57.683
and got rich
with that bald guy, so...

26:57.783 --> 26:59.227
Did you ever finish
watching Breaking Bad?

26:59.251 --> 27:03.956
No, because somebody changed
their Netflix password.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.891
All right.
Look, we're not doing this.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.902
There's like six Kardashians
that live on the street.

27:07.926 --> 27:10.162
There's security everywhere.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.299
I'm not breaking
into my girlfriend's house.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.007
Can't believe I'm breaking into
my girlfriend's house.

27:28.113 --> 27:29.648
Apple?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.654
Babe.

27:43.530 --> 27:46.331
I'm starting to freak out.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.738
This is so weird,
I don't get it.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.611
- Yo.
- Damn.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.878
What a palace.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.247
Look at that
timeless chandelier.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.916
Guys, don't touch anything.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.251
All right? She'll notice.
She's OCD as fuck.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.720
I did that shit one time in
a rainforest with a shaman.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.822
That's how I got my third eye.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.627
That's DMT, Leo.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.395
Find clues, please.

28:17.664 --> 28:20.732
Hey, don't touch
anything, though.

28:27.472 --> 28:28.707
Oh...

28:29.542 --> 28:31.243
I found a clue.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.082
Whoa.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.020
Oh my God.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.624
Leo!

28:44.723 --> 28:45.625
Oh, man.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.993
No, no, no, no, no.

28:48.093 --> 28:49.995
Leo.

28:50.095 --> 28:52.731
What the fuck did you just do?

28:52.831 --> 28:56.134
London, what is this dust?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.470
That's not dust,
that's people, man.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.441
Homie, did you just
break the dead grandma vase?

29:02.542 --> 29:04.409
Oh, fuck.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.678
We can fix this.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.121
I think that was actually
the cousin

29:07.145 --> 29:09.915
that no one really liked. So...

29:10.015 --> 29:11.350
We got to pick him up.

29:11.450 --> 29:15.220
Whoa, I'm not fucking
with human remains, man.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.488
Dude, Leo.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.957
You did it.

29:21.026 --> 29:24.062
It's all good. It's all good.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.801
At least it
was just one of them.

29:29.901 --> 29:33.338
I mean, it doesn't even
look that bad, guys.

29:39.579 --> 29:42.114
Leo...

29:42.214 --> 29:44.449
You are the worst best friend
I've ever had.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.557
You just re-killed her
entire family.

29:55.695 --> 29:57.071
We got a suspicious
vehicle leaving.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.230

Black G-Wagon covered
in safety pins.

30:03.569 --> 30:07.039
I swear to God, y'all better
think of some way to fix this.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.453
I got it.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.989
I got it, I figured it out.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.759
I don't want to smoke right now.

30:26.858 --> 30:28.860
Why are we whispering?

30:28.960 --> 30:30.563
Yeah, why are we whispering?

They can hear us.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.498
Who can hear us?

30:38.203 --> 30:40.372
We're wearing her entire family.

the lead in a 100...

46:09.935 --> 46:11.303
million dollar...

46:11.403 --> 46:13.640
movie that makes
you legendary forever.

46:13.740 --> 46:14.741
Dude, you're tripping.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.080
I would literally hire a hitman

46:16.141 --> 46:18.210
and take my parents
out to be Batman.

46:18.310 --> 46:20.412
We've already killed
one family today.

46:20.513 --> 46:22.323
Hey, I hate to break up
this bromance right now,

46:22.347 --> 46:23.949
but I just got a text
from Maxine.

46:24.049 --> 46:25.860
It says if you are not at
this meeting in 15 minutes,

46:25.884 --> 46:29.187
she is going to cut your
dick and balls off.

46:29.288 --> 46:31.423
That's the nice part,
do you want me to read the rest?

46:31.524 --> 46:32.791
We're good.

46:35.394 --> 46:36.495
What do I do?

46:37.896 --> 46:39.565
Bro, go to the meeting.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.534
I can't, I can't do it.

46:43.569 --> 46:45.270
I choose love.

46:45.370 --> 46:46.572
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:46.673 --> 46:49.074
I get it if you guys
don't want to be friends no more

46:49.174 --> 46:51.810
because this is career suicide.

46:51.910 --> 46:55.180
But if we didn't leave you
after that shitty ass,

46:55.280 --> 46:58.718
horrible, terrible,
worst thing that's ever

46:58.817 --> 47:01.820
been shown on a television
finale?

47:01.920 --> 47:05.357
Respectfully, we're not going
to leave you now.

47:06.626 --> 47:08.093
Real friends.

47:09.428 --> 47:11.296
We're good.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.700
Go get your girl, man.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.500
Can I borrow your car?

47:17.869 --> 47:20.405
My dawg.

47:20.506 --> 47:22.974
Sorry, Dylan.

47:26.746 --> 47:28.514
Thanks, Olive.

47:28.614 --> 47:30.048
Yo, hold up.

47:30.148 --> 47:32.384
Hey, where'd you say
that meeting was at again?

47:37.389 --> 47:39.358
Van Nuys Airport, how can
I help you?

47:39.458 --> 47:42.160
<i>Hey. Are there any
flights about to take off</i>

47:42.260 --> 47:45.430
or is there any buff dudes
with a neck pillow

47:45.531 --> 47:46.865
at the airport right now?

47:46.965 --> 47:49.134
<i>Uh, yeah, there actually is.
Yes.</i>

47:49.234 --> 47:50.268
There is.

47:50.369 --> 47:52.772
Yo, please, break
the wing or some shit.

47:52.871 --> 47:53.871
I'm on my way.

47:53.939 --> 47:55.775
All right, bye. Have a good day.

47:55.874 --> 47:57.175
Fucking weirdo.

47:59.311 --> 48:02.381
About to catch this jet,
brothers and sisters, what's up?

48:03.716 --> 48:05.117
Yo!

48:05.217 --> 48:07.152
Oh, it's that actor,
dude, right?

48:07.252 --> 48:10.590
What the fuck, dude,
are you trying to take my girl?

48:10.690 --> 48:12.525
Is she on there right now?

48:12.625 --> 48:13.693
Dennis Rodman?

48:13.793 --> 48:15.160
Why are you so mad, man?

48:15.260 --> 48:16.705
You should be mad
at the trash-ass finale, man.

48:16.729 --> 48:19.699
Fuck you, Dennis Rodman.

48:19.799 --> 48:20.800
Great job.

48:20.899 --> 48:23.435
Hey, superstar, what's up, baby?

48:23.536 --> 48:24.936
You stay sleeping.

48:25.036 --> 48:26.636
I'll be in Vegas, baby.
I'll be in Vegas.

48:26.672 --> 48:28.106
Stay awake from him!

48:31.878 --> 48:36.448
I can't believe you gave London
the keys to your car, bro.

48:36.549 --> 48:39.050
Got us sitting three
in the back right now.

48:39.151 --> 48:40.586
Three in the back.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.724
Damn it. Olive!

48:44.824 --> 48:46.491
Where are we going right now?

48:46.592 --> 48:50.563
You know I'm not letting
London miss that meeting, right?

48:50.663 --> 48:52.598
- The Batman meeting?
- Yeah.

48:53.900 --> 48:55.802
Who are you thinking
about for Robin?

48:55.902 --> 48:59.037
What do you think about, you
know, maybe like Peter Dinklage?

48:59.137 --> 49:00.907
Oh, thank you.

49:01.006 --> 49:03.308
Hold on one second. Thank you.

49:03.408 --> 49:04.976
Come to mama.

49:05.076 --> 49:06.679
Is he always this late?

49:06.779 --> 49:08.346
Hm? Is he late?

49:08.447 --> 49:14.986
I did not even notice.
I'm having such a good time.

49:15.086 --> 49:17.022
Damn, I love acting.

49:20.192 --> 49:21.727
Batman wears a mask.

49:21.828 --> 49:25.263
Just... the actor is going
to have to wear it constantly.

49:25.363 --> 49:27.867
So director,
tell me about your movie.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.535
I was hoping
you read the script.

49:29.635 --> 49:32.070
Have you read the script?

49:32.170 --> 49:34.039
Of course, he's read the script.

49:34.139 --> 49:35.541
Of course you read the script.

49:35.641 --> 49:37.710
London, tell them all about.
Just kidding.

49:37.810 --> 49:39.912
Does it look like I'm kidding?

49:40.011 --> 49:42.147
Whose dick do I gotta suck
around here

49:42.247 --> 49:44.449
to get some pancakes?

49:44.550 --> 49:46.953
End of scene. See, this
is going to be amazing.

49:47.052 --> 49:48.721
This movie is going
to shoot itself.

49:48.821 --> 49:51.089
I think I'm going
to shoot myself.

49:51.189 --> 49:53.425
I can't believe we let him
go in there with that mask.

49:53.526 --> 49:56.896
Leo's fucking wearing
an elephant on his head.

49:56.995 --> 49:58.731
Yeah, I got to be honest
you guys have had

49:58.831 --> 50:03.101
a lot of dumb ideas, but this
one... this one's really dumb.

50:03.201 --> 50:07.607
Shh, shh, shh, be still.

50:07.707 --> 50:09.174
This will hurt now.

50:11.209 --> 50:12.512
What are you doing?

50:13.746 --> 50:15.280
That's perfect.

50:18.751 --> 50:20.553
It's okay, it's okay.

50:22.454 --> 50:24.690
Don't touch it.

50:24.790 --> 50:26.358
Are you feeling okay?

50:26.458 --> 50:29.060
You got hit in the face
really hard.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.564
It is so hard
to take you seriously...

50:31.664 --> 50:34.967
with that fucking thing
on your face!

50:35.066 --> 50:38.203
Good Bad People sucked.

50:38.303 --> 50:42.073
- Your finale was shit.
- He didn't write it.

50:42.173 --> 50:44.075
But you're
the best thing of the show.

50:44.175 --> 50:45.745
Uh, thanks.

50:45.845 --> 50:48.113
I mean, honestly, thank God

50:48.213 --> 50:49.825
I pulled your old phone out
of the garbage can,

50:49.849 --> 50:51.660
found out that your dad's
birthday is your passcode

50:51.684 --> 50:54.286
and used Find my iPhone
to track your coordinates.

50:54.386 --> 50:59.759
You have been very hard
to keep track of today, Mister.

50:59.859 --> 51:01.859
Oh, and you really
shouldn't throw that stuff away,

51:01.928 --> 51:03.663
you know, freaking crazy people

51:03.763 --> 51:05.330
could get a hold of that shit.

51:06.766 --> 51:09.200
Did you just give me stitches?

51:09.301 --> 51:11.904
Lucky for you both
my parents are doctors.

51:12.004 --> 51:14.439

without my sewing kit.

the fucking elephant man.

You a cool cop or something?

Yeah, stoney smurf.
Give me a little bit of that.

Thank you, how about that?

or is this some good-ass weed?

54:08.581 --> 54:11.416
This is some good ass weed, bro.

54:11.517 --> 54:13.986
Oh my God, it's all

you really know me.

54:36.842 --> 54:40.713

55:46.444 --> 55:48.113
Yeah. I mean, it went viral.

Also thank you for my stitches.

56:37.730 --> 56:38.998
- The Band-Aid.
- Yeah.

56:40.299 --> 56:42.902
Looks good. Poor baby.

56:43.002 --> 56:45.104
You're actually cool.

Uh... Yeah, okay.

acting weird all day?

Baby, I can explain.

Yo, it's this a milkshake
from Mel's?

01:16:32.559 --> 01:16:36.563
Yeah, that's Redeye cafe, 100%.

01:16:36.662 --> 01:16:39.465
Angel, take us to Redeye Cafe.

01:16:39.566 --> 01:16:40.966
Avril was in the hallway.

01:16:41.767 --> 01:16:43.635
I think she loves me.

01:16:44.736 --> 01:16:46.138
She kissed me, man.

01:16:46.238 --> 01:16:49.041
First Why-G loves you.
Now Avril loves you.

01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:52.311
Yo! Why you guys always tell me
I'm lying about this shit, bro?

01:16:52.411 --> 01:16:54.713
Thank you.

01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:03.222
There you go, cutie.
Get my number later, huh?

01:17:03.322 --> 01:17:04.823
Fuck you.

01:17:10.696 --> 01:17:14.833
Whew. She's not in here, dude.
I give up.

01:17:14.933 --> 01:17:16.144
Family night out with the boys.

01:17:16.168 --> 01:17:17.736
We might as well
get something to eat.

01:17:17.836 --> 01:17:19.638
I don't want to eat.

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:25.878
Oh, wow. Was there a flash
sale at Hot Topic?

01:17:25.978 --> 01:17:27.312
Ha.

01:17:27.412 --> 01:17:29.081
We'll take anything but a booth.

01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:33.652
Great. You can have
that booth right there.

01:17:33.752 --> 01:17:35.821
I'll see in a second.

01:17:37.422 --> 01:17:40.627
Fucking hate booths, man.

01:17:40.726 --> 01:17:42.427
Man, they got
a jukebox in there.

01:17:42.529 --> 01:17:44.763
Somebody give me a quarter.

01:17:50.035 --> 01:17:53.372
I think it really
might be over, man.

01:17:53.472 --> 01:17:57.442
Like, did I choose wrong?
All I wanted was Apple.

01:17:58.677 --> 01:18:02.181
Maxine's right, man.

01:18:02.281 --> 01:18:05.684
Can't have the girl
and have the job.

01:18:05.784 --> 01:18:07.920
Save the world, lose the girl.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.023
In your case, lose the girl.

01:18:11.123 --> 01:18:14.293
Don't save the world
like Batman would.

01:18:14.393 --> 01:18:15.761
It could be worse, man.

01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:18.598
Your stalker could have just...

01:18:18.697 --> 01:18:21.400
cut off your dick
back there, you know?

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.202
I can see it now.

01:18:23.302 --> 01:18:25.538
Her with a little chain
rocking your cut-off dick

01:18:25.638 --> 01:18:31.176
all iced out. Oh my God, bro.

01:18:31.276 --> 01:18:34.413
But for real, though, man.
You just got to let it go.

01:18:34.514 --> 01:18:35.682
She was never yours.

01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:38.685
It was just your turn, man.

01:18:38.784 --> 01:18:40.185
Ouch.

01:18:40.285 --> 01:18:42.221
So what can I get you?

01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:46.191
Some Panic at the Disco pancakes
or some studded belt omelets?

01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:48.628
I'm going to have
the Eggs Benedict

01:18:48.727 --> 01:18:50.395
and a glass of OJ.

01:18:50.495 --> 01:18:52.097
Let me get a banana split.

01:18:52.197 --> 01:18:56.101
I don't see it on the menu, but
can I get yellowtail sashimi?

01:18:56.201 --> 01:18:58.103
Can I have Thanksgiving dinner?

01:18:58.203 --> 01:19:01.840
You know with cranberry sauce.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.942
- And make sure it's organic.
- Really?

01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:06.745
I will have a cheeseburger,
a milkshake.

01:19:06.845 --> 01:19:08.814
Are you writing
any of this down now?

01:19:08.914 --> 01:19:10.282
No, I just found out

01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:14.052
my hamster, GG
just got her fucking period.

01:19:14.152 --> 01:19:15.887
Who knew a fucking hamster
gets her period?

01:19:15.988 --> 01:19:19.424
That's so weird, right?
I don't get my period anymore.

01:19:19.525 --> 01:19:21.226
I'm only 35.

01:19:21.326 --> 01:19:23.639
That's what happens when you
fuck with too many dirty dicks.

01:19:23.663 --> 01:19:24.997
You know what I'm saying?

01:19:25.097 --> 01:19:27.165
Jams that shit up
like the fucking Holland Tunnel.

01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:29.636
Just got to get in there and
scrape the sides of the walls

01:19:29.736 --> 01:19:31.436
and get the water
flowing through again.

01:19:31.537 --> 01:19:34.574
You know, nobody wants to
go up there and do that for me.

01:19:34.674 --> 01:19:36.542
Let me know if you guys
are busy later,

01:19:36.643 --> 01:19:38.544
at a My fucking Chemical
Romance concert,

01:19:38.645 --> 01:19:41.046
maybe one of you can come over
and fucking unplug it.

01:19:41.146 --> 01:19:43.248
Anyway, cheeseburgers
and fries for everybody?

01:19:43.348 --> 01:19:44.449
See you in a second.

01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:50.956
Jesus Christ.

01:19:51.056 --> 01:19:53.091
Furries are aggressive.

01:19:54.661 --> 01:19:56.663
I'm not a furry.

01:19:56.763 --> 01:19:59.131
This is for sleeping.
I was asleep.

01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:01.099
No one's ever...
I've never had sex in this.

01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:02.968
Um, Maxine called me like
100 fucking times.

01:20:03.068 --> 01:20:04.178
She's on the phone right now,
she says.

01:20:04.202 --> 01:20:05.672
If I don't hand you the phone,

01:20:05.772 --> 01:20:07.973
then she's going to cut
my dick off, so...

01:20:08.907 --> 01:20:10.576
Oh, jeez.

01:20:12.311 --> 01:20:13.713
Hi, Maxine.

01:20:13.812 --> 01:20:15.557
London, there you are. I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

01:20:15.581 --> 01:20:17.115
Hold on. I don't know.

01:20:17.215 --> 01:20:19.093
I do not know how to fix her
nose. Get a fucking chainsaw.

01:20:19.117 --> 01:20:21.053
I don't know. Hey, okay,
I need to talk to you.

01:20:21.153 --> 01:20:25.625
I don't want to have this talk.
I already know I fucked up.

01:20:25.725 --> 01:20:27.125
I'm sorry.

01:20:27.225 --> 01:20:28.537
I just had a long conversation
with the director,

01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:31.997
and at first he did
not see you as Batman.

01:20:32.097 --> 01:20:33.932
He didn't, you know,
he couldn't envision it

01:20:34.032 --> 01:20:36.210
because the physicality
and I told him I was like, look,

01:20:36.234 --> 01:20:38.313
we can put him on steroids,
we can get him calf implants.

01:20:38.337 --> 01:20:40.105
We can do all
the fucking shit, right?

01:20:40.205 --> 01:20:42.941
He didn't get it until he saw
that video of you getting

01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:44.544
punched in the face,
which he thought

01:20:44.644 --> 01:20:47.479
that you staged
for him, which...

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.147
What?

01:20:49.247 --> 01:20:52.685
But the point is, he fucking
bought it hook, line and sinker.

01:20:52.785 --> 01:20:57.089
And you are the next
fucking Batman.

01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:59.991
- Shut the...
- I know.

01:21:00.092 --> 01:21:01.269
I mean, look,
there's still a lot of like,

01:21:01.293 --> 01:21:02.671
you know, hammering out
that I could do

01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:04.072
with the vaginas
of business affairs.

01:21:04.096 --> 01:21:06.766
But those cunts, they know me,
they know me.

01:21:06.865 --> 01:21:08.900
I have to... I have to call you
back. Yes, okay.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.011
You're going to be a fucking
little action figure.

01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:11.504
You're going to be.

01:21:11.604 --> 01:21:13.247
Little kids are going to put
you in microwaves and shit

01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:15.641
because you are
going to be fucking Batman.

01:21:15.742 --> 01:21:17.476
<i>I love you.</i>

01:21:17.577 --> 01:21:19.878
I mean, you know what I mean?
I don't really.

01:21:19.978 --> 01:21:21.346
I just... I'm proud of you.

01:21:21.446 --> 01:21:25.150
Okay, I love you, too.
What? What?

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:27.886
Please don't get canceled.
Please...

01:21:27.986 --> 01:21:29.888
I got the role.

01:21:29.988 --> 01:21:31.223
- I'm fucking Batman.
- No!

01:21:31.323 --> 01:21:32.725
I'm Batman!

01:21:32.825 --> 01:21:34.727
Oh, sick, dude.

01:21:34.827 --> 01:21:36.395
Oh my God!

01:21:36.495 --> 01:21:38.930
- You got it?
- Yes.

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.568
I'm fucking Batman!

01:21:42.668 --> 01:21:43.668
Can I have my phone.

01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:45.838
I'm sorry, here.

01:21:45.937 --> 01:21:47.507
Did you look at my photos?

01:21:47.607 --> 01:21:49.975
No, no.

01:21:50.075 --> 01:21:52.578
This has been the weirdest
first day at work ever.

01:21:52.678 --> 01:21:56.915
Looks like it's about time
for you to hop on out of here.

01:21:57.015 --> 01:21:58.316
See you guys.

01:21:59.685 --> 01:22:02.254
I... I got to call Apple.

01:22:02.354 --> 01:22:04.122
I got to try. I'm
sorry, I don't want

01:22:04.222 --> 01:22:05.924
to kill the vibe, but like...

01:22:06.024 --> 01:22:08.026
Maybe she'll answer.

01:22:09.461 --> 01:22:10.830
<i>Hello.</i>

01:22:10.929 --> 01:22:12.931
- Baby. Hi.
<i>- What do you want?</i>

01:22:13.031 --> 01:22:16.401
- Hold on, I just... can we talk?
<i>- What?</i>

01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:18.805
Like no arguing, just...

01:22:18.905 --> 01:22:22.542
just I want to
tell you something and...

01:22:22.642 --> 01:22:25.377
I'm sorry about today.

01:22:25.477 --> 01:22:27.446
Do you remember where
we had our first kiss?

01:22:27.547 --> 01:22:28.714
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:28.815 --> 01:22:30.348
Can you meet me there
in 30 minutes?

01:22:30.449 --> 01:22:31.884
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

01:22:31.983 --> 01:22:34.085
All right. I'm on my way. Bye.

01:22:35.588 --> 01:22:36.823
She's going to see you?

01:22:36.923 --> 01:22:38.591
Yeah.

01:22:38.691 --> 01:22:40.827
What the fuck just happened
in the last 35 seconds?

01:22:40.927 --> 01:22:42.461
You're Batman.

01:22:42.562 --> 01:22:44.463
I'm Batman!

01:22:44.564 --> 01:22:46.097
Oh my God.

01:22:46.198 --> 01:22:47.609
I wish I had the Batmobile,
but I have Dylan's truck.

01:22:47.633 --> 01:22:48.835
Can I please use it?

01:22:48.935 --> 01:22:50.570
Keys are in the ignition...

01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:51.871
of the car...

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:55.106
Which is unlocked outside,

01:22:55.207 --> 01:22:57.042
most likely still running.

01:22:57.142 --> 01:23:00.011
God, you're an idiot.

01:23:03.415 --> 01:23:04.684
Let me out.

01:23:07.085 --> 01:23:08.119
Love y'all, man.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.889
Ooh. Don't fall asleep.

01:23:09.988 --> 01:23:12.825
Love you too, dawg.

01:23:12.925 --> 01:23:14.326
Later, boys.

01:23:16.127 --> 01:23:19.231
So it seems like all
is good in the world again,

01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.734
except for this fucking booth.

01:23:23.803 --> 01:23:24.904
Oh.

01:23:25.003 --> 01:23:28.173

You know what? She did.

01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:28.894
She actually did...

01:25:28.995 --> 01:25:30.462
That's her.

01:25:32.765 --> 01:25:35.300
Um, actually that...

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.444
Did she say where she was going?

01:25:36.468 --> 01:25:38.203
Uh, you know what? She...

01:25:38.303 --> 01:25:39.413
Did she say where she was going?

01:25:39.437 --> 01:25:41.841
Yeah, you know what, she...

01:25:41.941 --> 01:25:43.843
Okay okay okay... All right...

01:25:43.943 --> 01:25:46.344
Your dad's dead.

01:25:46.444 --> 01:25:48.748
Actually that works
for both of us.

01:25:50.148 --> 01:25:51.459
It used to only work for me.
I'm so sorry.

01:25:51.483 --> 01:25:52.852
Wasn't thinking there.

01:25:52.952 --> 01:25:55.032
I can make anybody famous.
I can do fucking anything.

01:25:55.121 --> 01:25:56.641
Joaquin Phoenix,
no one would hire him.

01:25:56.722 --> 01:25:58.156
He had half a face.

01:25:58.256 --> 01:26:00.526
I made that happen.

01:26:00.626 --> 01:26:01.393
Adam Sandler?

01:26:01.493 --> 01:26:03.062
They called me about Uncut Gems.

01:26:03.161 --> 01:26:04.964
It was initially
about circumcision.

01:26:05.064 --> 01:26:08.433
Okay? I made them change it.

01:26:08.534 --> 01:26:10.936
Adam Sandler went from silly
fucking goose

01:26:11.037 --> 01:26:13.506
to genius guy in Uncut Gems.

01:26:13.606 --> 01:26:15.449
That's why I don't have
Instagram cause I'd just be

01:26:15.473 --> 01:26:18.110
looking at butts all day.

01:26:18.209 --> 01:26:19.645
Big fat butts.

01:26:19.745 --> 01:26:22.114
Anyways, you guys should try
a finger in your ass.

01:26:22.213 --> 01:26:23.516
It's pretty fun.

01:26:23.616 --> 01:26:25.159
I wouldn't like, you know,
start with it

01:26:25.183 --> 01:26:26.418
but you could finish with it.

01:26:26.519 --> 01:26:29.922
Oh, wow. Was there a flash sale
at Hot Topic?

01:26:30.022 --> 01:26:31.057
We'll take a booth.

01:26:31.157 --> 01:26:34.026
Or anything but a booth.

01:26:34.126 --> 01:26:35.695
Take anything but a booth.

01:26:35.795 --> 01:26:36.829
Okay.

01:26:36.929 --> 01:26:38.664
We don't want a booth.

01:26:38.764 --> 01:26:40.365
But you want a booth.

01:26:40.465 --> 01:26:41.667
I can't help you.

01:26:41.767 --> 01:26:42.767
We'll take a booth.

01:26:42.835 --> 01:26:43.945
We went to the wrong restaurant.
Let's go.

01:26:43.969 --> 01:26:45.104
God damn it.

01:26:45.203 --> 01:26:46.572
You guys decide what you want?

01:26:46.672 --> 01:26:49.274
And don't take long cause I've
got a big part tomorrow.

01:26:49.374 --> 01:26:52.377
I'm playing a Bush in the new
Leonardo DiCaprio film.

01:26:52.477 --> 01:26:55.648
Hm? Congratulations to me.
Correct. Yeah. That's right.

01:26:55.748 --> 01:27:00.586
Hey! My agent said this was
gonna be an easy gig!

01:27:00.686 --> 01:27:03.254
You didn't even give me shoes!

01:27:03.354 --> 01:27:05.858
Hey! I'm an A-list
player, homes.

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:07.126
I don't play this stuff.

01:27:07.258 --> 01:27:09.095
What is this?
What am I supposed to be?

01:27:09.195 --> 01:27:11.764
A cave man!

01:27:11.864 --> 01:27:16.001
Hey! I'm outta here.
I'm changing my clothes.

01:27:16.102 --> 01:27:18.104
Hey, do you know
where you can go, eh?

01:27:18.204 --> 01:27:19.672
Go to hell.

01:27:19.772 --> 01:27:22.842
Right, everybody take a nice
deep breath.

01:27:22.942 --> 01:27:26.612
You all right?

01:27:26.712 --> 01:27:29.481
Okay, you sure?
You need like a Luden's?

01:27:29.582 --> 01:27:31.917
You guys got a Luden's?

01:27:33.052 --> 01:27:34.787
It was taken from the bedroom...

01:27:36.989 --> 01:27:39.324
Why'd you park so fucking far?

01:27:39.424 --> 01:27:41.227
Does anybody here have any X?

01:27:41.359 --> 01:27:44.797
- You're hanging with us!
- Yes! Woo!

01:27:44.897 --> 01:27:47.233
Fuck that deeb, dude,
he's gone, man!

01:27:47.332 --> 01:27:48.634
Fuck him!

01:27:48.734 --> 01:27:51.103

You're mic'd. It's a movie.

01:27:55.074 --> 01:27:59.078
You should give me your number
after this scene.

01:27:59.178 --> 01:28:02.380
- What?
- Nothing.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.349
Did you just ask me to give you
my number?

01:28:04.449 --> 01:28:05.851
No.

01:28:05.951 --> 01:28:07.219
What did you say then?

01:28:07.318 --> 01:28:08.930
Because it sounded like
"you should give me

01:28:08.954 --> 01:28:10.122
your number after this."

01:28:10.222 --> 01:28:15.161
No, I said I need a cucumber
for me eyes.

01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:18.964

under your eyes.
