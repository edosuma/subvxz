10:12.165 --> 10:13.693
Do you want to tell us
\h\h\h\hwhat happened?

10:13.693 --> 10:16.528
\h\h\h\h\hSophomore year,
I was tackling a fullback.

10:16.528 --> 10:20.792
He was a big guy and I...
\h\h\hdislocated my elbow.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.099
Painful.

10:23.099 --> 10:27.363
\h\h\hYeah, and... junior year,
I lost sight of the quarterback.

10:27.363 --> 10:29.429
\h\h\h\h-Got blindsided.
-Did you get this bruise

10:29.429 --> 10:31.429
playing football?

10:31.429 --> 10:33.792
Uh, that one, I don’t know.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.033
I’m not sure.

10:35.957 --> 10:37.363
When’s your next game?

10:37.363 --> 10:39.363
For me?

10:39.363 --> 10:42.693
Never, ’cause I got cut.

10:42.693 --> 10:47.000
And then Tilly, my girlfriend,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.429
she broke up with me
the next day, so...

10:50.429 --> 10:53.099
Did that happen today?

10:53.099 --> 10:54.957
Tilly was yesterday and...

10:54.957 --> 10:56.957
team was the day before.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.066
Um...

11:00.264 --> 11:03.924
Then, this morning...

11:03.924 --> 11:05.429
uh, my parents told me

11:05.429 --> 11:08.594
that they’re calling it quits.

11:08.594 --> 11:10.594
Filing for divorce.

11:10.594 --> 11:14.264
That is a lot to deal with, man.

11:14.264 --> 11:17.330
\hI-I did something
really stupid, um...

11:19.264 --> 11:21.297
I...

11:21.297 --> 11:23.825
I tried to kill myself.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.660
Yeah.

11:33.924 --> 11:36.099
-Tyler?
\h-Yeah.

11:36.099 --> 11:38.099
\hListen, have you been thinking
about taking pills for a while?

11:38.099 --> 11:39.132
No, man, no.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.594
It was...

11:40.594 --> 11:42.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hgosh, it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

11:42.264 --> 11:43.264
I was just...

11:43.264 --> 11:45.759
I was, I was angry and I--

11:45.759 --> 11:48.198
\hI’m not like that,
like, I’m-I’m not--

11:48.198 --> 11:50.099
I, uh...

11:50.099 --> 11:51.924
Where am I...?

11:51.924 --> 11:53.462
(monitor beeping)

11:53.462 --> 11:54.693
(muttering)

11:55.660 --> 11:57.330
-Hey, Tyler, look at me.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Oh...

11:57.330 --> 11:58.627
\h\h\h\h\h-Huh?
-Open your eyes.

11:58.627 --> 12:01.132
\h\h\h\h\h-Okay, okay.
-Bruising, confusion,

12:01.132 --> 12:02.825
-scleral icterus.
\h\h\h\h-No, guys.

12:02.825 --> 12:03.957
I’m good, I’m okay.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.165
(laughing):
I’m okay...

12:05.165 --> 12:06.363
Whoa, whoa.

12:06.363 --> 12:07.792
Okay, okay.

12:07.792 --> 12:10.198
I’m okay, I’m okay, I’m good.

12:15.198 --> 12:16.825
\h\h\hAnd what time did
the contractions start?

12:16.825 --> 12:19.165
\h\h\hHer first contraction
was at 6:42, second at 7:15,

12:19.165 --> 12:21.627
\h\h\h\h\h\h-third at 7:33.
-It sounds like early labor,

12:21.627 --> 12:24.462
which isn’t great, considering
\h\h\hshe’s five weeks early.

12:24.462 --> 12:26.495
We can deal with that, and we’ll
give her steroids to help

12:26.495 --> 12:28.429
-the baby’s lungs mature.
-Her heart rate has raised

12:28.429 --> 12:31.363
\hfrom 100 to 125
in the past hour.

12:31.363 --> 12:34.495
\h\h\h\hShe has a history
of dilated cardiomyopathy.

12:34.495 --> 12:36.759
\h\h\hShe cannot handle
a sustained tachycardia.

12:36.759 --> 12:39.363
\h\h\hBelieve it or not,
she can be a ton of fun.

12:39.363 --> 12:41.528
\h\hYou should see her when
she has a few drinks in her.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.198
Mina, I’m sure Dr. Lin
\his very well versed

12:43.198 --> 12:44.825
in her patient’s medical needs.

12:44.825 --> 12:46.495
\h\h\h\hAn excess of caution
is appropriate in this case.

12:46.495 --> 12:48.858
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSo, normally,
if your contractions stopped,

12:48.858 --> 12:51.198
\h\hwe would watch you, we might
even consider sending you home.

12:51.198 --> 12:53.033
But with your cardiac history,
\h\hI think the safest choice

12:53.033 --> 12:54.858
is to get you comfortable
\h\hin labor and delivery,

12:54.858 --> 12:56.594
and we will monitor
\hyou and the baby.

12:56.594 --> 12:58.825
\h\h\hAnd you’ll be back
to check on her shortly.

12:58.825 --> 13:00.132
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNIC:
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

13:00.132 --> 13:01.429
You’re welcome.

13:01.429 --> 13:03.858
I’m getting Dr. Austin.

13:03.858 --> 13:06.099
A full cardiac exam should

13:06.099 --> 13:09.825
put everyone’s mind at ease,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hespecially...

13:12.429 --> 13:14.660
(machine beeping)

13:17.759 --> 13:20.198
All right, good news.

13:20.198 --> 13:22.033
Tyler’s brain CT is negative.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.924
No bleeding and no signs

13:23.924 --> 13:25.693
of cerebral edema--
what about the labs?

13:25.693 --> 13:27.429
Not good news.

13:27.429 --> 13:28.759
Let me guess.

13:28.759 --> 13:30.198
Fulminant hepatic failure

13:30.198 --> 13:32.429
from all the acetaminophen
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hhe took?

13:32.429 --> 13:35.132
He needs a liver transplant
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hor he’ll die.

13:35.132 --> 13:37.429
\h\h\h\h\hI wish I could say
I haven’t seen this before,

13:37.429 --> 13:39.594
but I’ve seen it too many times.

13:39.594 --> 13:42.099
Acetaminophen overdose
\his the leading cause

13:42.099 --> 13:43.924
of liver failure in the U.S.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHe’s young,
otherwise in good health.

13:45.924 --> 13:47.924
\h\h\h\h\hThat should put him at
the top of the transplant list.

13:47.924 --> 13:49.759
He could get an organ quickly.

13:49.759 --> 13:52.759
If we tell the transplant board

13:52.759 --> 13:55.165
that Tyler attempted suicide,

13:55.165 --> 13:58.924
he will be ruled ineligible.

13:58.924 --> 14:00.660
\hHe won’t be at the top
of the transplant list.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.000
He won’t be on the list at all.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.330
That is a rule here at Chastain.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.792
As long as we get him
\h\h\h\h\hcounseling,

14:09.792 --> 14:12.165
I say...

14:14.924 --> 14:17.495
...what suicide attempt?

14:18.495 --> 14:20.561
Wait, did I hear that right?

14:21.957 --> 14:24.891
Is that Dr. Pravesh or is that
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\han imposter?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.594
Look, I’m the same man
that I’ve always been,

14:28.594 --> 14:31.429
but I see more shades of gray
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthan I used to.

14:31.429 --> 14:34.297
Sometimes, to do right,

14:34.297 --> 14:36.660
you can’t follow the rules.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.759
I think the short answer

14:38.759 --> 14:41.231
is, I’m not an intern anymore.

14:43.495 --> 14:45.957
I’ll transfer him to the ICU.

14:45.957 --> 14:49.264
\h\hAnd I’ll contact
the transplant team.

14:55.132 --> 14:58.924
Well, you’re definitely still
\h\hpregnant, but I’m guessing

14:58.924 --> 15:01.297
-you already knew that.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(laughs)

15:01.297 --> 15:02.693
(grunting)

15:02.693 --> 15:04.858
\h\h\h\h\h\hShallow breaths,
use your abdomen like this.

15:04.858 --> 15:06.165
(short rhythmic breaths)

15:06.165 --> 15:07.297
What do you see?

15:07.297 --> 15:09.792
Heart’s beating a little fast.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.726
But you’re pumping for two,
\hso that’s totally normal.

15:16.693 --> 15:17.858
What is it?

15:17.858 --> 15:20.693
All good.

15:20.693 --> 15:22.528
\h\h\hListen, I’ve got some
instructions for your ladies

15:22.528 --> 15:24.858
\h\h\h\hin waiting on how
to best take care for you.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.891
-So, they’ll be right back.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Okay.

15:27.825 --> 15:29.891
(indistinct announcement
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hover P.A.)

15:34.165 --> 15:36.660
One of her heart valves
\h\h\h\h\h\his failing.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.033
It’s leaking severely.

15:39.033 --> 15:40.330
Mitral regurg.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.000
It’s causing fluid to back up

15:42.000 --> 15:43.495
into her lungs.

15:43.495 --> 15:45.594
We have to, uh, get her
\hin surgery right away.

15:45.594 --> 15:46.858
I’m gonna book an OR
\h\h\hand scrub in.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.528
\h\h\hWhoa, wait, take
your foot off the gas.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.099
The regurg isn’t emergent.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.693
The valve needs to be replaced.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.198
With the continued stress
\hof pregnancy, she could

15:53.198 --> 15:54.924
-decompensate rapidly.
\h\h-Or it could last

15:54.924 --> 15:57.528
another week or another month.
\h\hThere’s no way to predict.

15:57.528 --> 15:59.528
Do not play Russian roulette
\h\h\h\h\hwith Adaku’s life.

15:59.528 --> 16:02.759
No delay, we need to get her
\h\h\hto surgery right now.

16:02.759 --> 16:05.429
No... I’m gonna close my eyes
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand pretend

16:05.429 --> 16:08.033
the last 15 seconds of this
conversation never happened.

16:08.033 --> 16:11.099
\hAnd when I open them,
history will be erased,

16:11.099 --> 16:13.297
\hand I will know that you
still have unlimited faith

16:13.297 --> 16:16.363
in my ability to deliver
\hthe best care possible

16:16.363 --> 16:17.792
to your friend.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.495
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNIC:
We obviously trust
\h\hyour judgment.

16:20.495 --> 16:21.792
What I think Mina’s
\htrying to say is,

16:21.792 --> 16:23.429
we need to save Mom and baby.

16:23.429 --> 16:24.924
\h\hNo, that is not
what I want to say.

16:24.924 --> 16:27.759
\h\h\hThe mother is
priority number one.

16:27.759 --> 16:29.429
There is no choice
to be made, Mina.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.264
We save both baby and the mama.

16:31.264 --> 16:32.759
Adaku is a high-risk pregnancy.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.264
\h\hWe need to get
our ducks in a row

16:34.264 --> 16:36.429
-before surgery, Mina.
\h\h\h-Thank you, Nic.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.924
Now, that means we have to line
up the best anesthesiologist,

16:38.924 --> 16:40.594
the best neonatologist,

16:40.594 --> 16:43.132
have an on-call perfusionist,
\h\h\h\hand put blood on hold.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.759
It’s gonna take a few hours,
\h\h\hand once everything is

16:45.759 --> 16:47.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hin place,
Dr. Lin will deliver the baby

16:47.924 --> 16:50.429
and we will repair the valve.

16:50.429 --> 16:53.099
\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd there is
every reason to believe

16:53.099 --> 16:55.264
it’s going to be fine.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.891
If her condition changes,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hpage me.

16:59.429 --> 17:00.957
Look, if you are frightened,

17:00.957 --> 17:03.594
\hyou are gonna transfer
that anxiety onto Adaku.

17:03.594 --> 17:07.000
The only thing we can do now
is show rock-solid support.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.462
And to restate the obvious,
\h\hMina, I’m here for you.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.858
Okay?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.495
(exhales)

17:28.000 --> 17:29.462
So, your patient, Dawn Long,

17:29.462 --> 17:31.429
you moved her to an LTACH?

17:31.429 --> 17:33.759
Family didn’t want to let her
\h\h\h\h\hgo, so in deference

17:33.759 --> 17:35.495
\h\h\h\h\h\hto their wishes,
I admitted her to a facility

17:35.495 --> 17:36.858
where she can be safe
\h\h\hand comfortable.

17:36.858 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, just wondering
\habout the timing.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.033
Meaning?

17:43.198 --> 17:46.858
Well, if you keep her alive
\h\h\hpast the 90-day mark,

17:46.858 --> 17:48.363
then her outcome won’t
\h\hbe tracked anymore

17:48.363 --> 17:50.000
\h\hand you can claim
your patient survived

17:50.000 --> 17:51.297
the Mother of All Surgeries.

17:51.297 --> 17:53.165
As can the hospital.

17:53.165 --> 17:54.957
\hBetter outcomes
mean more patients

17:54.957 --> 17:56.528
and better Medicare
\h\hreimbursements.

17:56.528 --> 17:58.165
\h\h\h\h\hYeah, agreed,
except neither of those

17:58.165 --> 18:00.264
are appropriate reasons
for a medical decision.

18:00.264 --> 18:02.594
So, tell me, what’s
the harm in allowing

18:02.594 --> 18:05.099
\h\h\ha family to live with hope
for just a little while longer?

18:05.099 --> 18:07.495
\h\h\h\h\h\hIn a facility
owned by Red Rock costing

18:07.495 --> 18:09.033
thousands of dollars a day.

18:09.033 --> 18:11.495
Exactly-- you’re making
\h\h\h\hmy case for me.

18:17.495 --> 18:20.264
Tyler’s an excellent candidate
\h\h\hfor a liver transplant.

18:20.264 --> 18:21.528
\h\h\h\h\hThe patient
is otherwise healthy,

18:21.528 --> 18:23.594
\h\h\hno underlying
medical conditions?

18:23.594 --> 18:26.264
None, and he’s a teenager with
\hhis whole life ahead of him.

18:26.264 --> 18:28.000
According to your notes,
\h\h\h\h\h\hhe presented

18:28.000 --> 18:29.825
with an overdose of painkillers.

18:29.825 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, acetaminophen.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.528
He’s a football player.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.924
Tried to self-treat
\h\h\hhis back pain.

18:33.924 --> 18:36.099
Took too many.

18:36.099 --> 18:38.198
Ah, this was a...
\h\h\h\h\h(laughs)

18:38.198 --> 18:41.693
a-a therapeutic misadventure.

18:41.693 --> 18:43.429
You know, people don’t
realize how easy it is

18:43.429 --> 18:45.693
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hto take too much
over-the-counter pain medicine.

18:45.693 --> 18:47.429
You talk to our ER staff,
\h\h\h\hthey’ll tell you.

18:47.429 --> 18:49.429
-They see it all the time.
\h\h\h-You understand that

18:49.429 --> 18:52.198
patients with suicidal ideations
are disqualified

18:52.198 --> 18:54.264
from receiving transplants
\h\h\h\h\hat our hospital?

18:54.264 --> 18:56.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Mm-hmm.
\h\h-We’ve had a few
recent bad outcomes.

18:56.429 --> 18:58.924
\hAnd any more could put
our program in jeopardy.

18:58.924 --> 19:01.132
Of course.

19:01.132 --> 19:05.000
Was Tyler’s overdose
\ha suicide attempt?

19:06.165 --> 19:09.429
Absolutely not.

19:09.429 --> 19:13.099
We’ll get Tyler listed.

19:13.099 --> 19:15.000
Notify UNOS.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.297

he’s first priority.

19:17.297 --> 19:18.924
Great.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.825
Thank you.

19:29.594 --> 19:30.825
Torturing yourself?

19:30.825 --> 19:34.099
Facing our new reality.

19:34.099 --> 19:36.759
The Barrett Cain Center
\h\h\hfor Neurosurgery.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.957
He’s a pot of gold at the end
\h\h\h\hof Red Rock’s rainbow.

19:38.957 --> 19:40.264
I’m the chief of surgery,

19:40.264 --> 19:41.858
and I still can’t control him.

19:41.858 --> 19:42.957
You remember Dawn Long?

19:42.957 --> 19:44.924
The lovely woman with seven kids

19:44.924 --> 19:46.759
who had the Mother
of All Surgeries?

19:46.759 --> 19:49.594
He had her transferred today
\h\h\hto an LTACH for rehab.

19:49.594 --> 19:51.099
\h\h\h(groans)
You’re joking.

19:51.099 --> 19:53.099
He was gaming the system
\hto boost his own stats

19:53.099 --> 19:54.594
at the expense of his patients.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.594
\hThat’s what I’m here
to talk to you about.

19:56.594 --> 19:58.495
You know how I’ve been
\htrying to play nice

19:58.495 --> 20:00.132

\h\h\h\h\h\hto find out

20:00.132 --> 20:01.297
-what he’s up to?
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yes.

20:01.297 --> 20:02.825
I’ve seen multiple surgeries

20:02.825 --> 20:04.825
with residents in charge,

20:04.825 --> 20:06.429
overtreatment, up-coding.

20:06.429 --> 20:08.330
\h\h\h\h\h\hThis morning
he operated on a patient

20:08.330 --> 20:10.495
\h\h\hwho shouldn’t have had
surgery in the first place,

20:10.495 --> 20:13.462
\h\h\hthen condemned him to life
on a vent in a vegetative state

20:13.462 --> 20:15.363
just so he wouldn’t have
\h\h\ha death in his OR.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.132
I’m not surprised.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.462
We have to do something.

20:18.462 --> 20:20.297
\h\h\h\h\h\hdon’t have
to do anything.

20:20.297 --> 20:22.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hhave to stay
out of the line of fire.

20:22.297 --> 20:25.000
Chastain needs good doctors
like you now more than ever.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.099
\h\h\h\hAnd your contract
is coming up for renewal.

20:27.099 --> 20:29.330
\h\h\h\h\h\hIf he thinks
that you’re against him,

20:29.330 --> 20:30.594
you’re gone.

20:30.594 --> 20:32.297
What about you?

20:32.297 --> 20:34.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMy contract is
virtually unbreakable, so...

20:35.792 --> 20:37.264

\hChest feels heavy.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.330
\hShe became acutely short of
breath and her 02 sat dropped.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.660
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMINA:
Harsh holosystolic murmur.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.330
We need to take another
\h\hlook at that valve.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.594
Coming up.

20:55.594 --> 20:57.924
A chord must have ruptured.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAUSTIN:
\h\h\h\hIt’s wide-open
mitral regurgitation.

20:59.924 --> 21:01.495
That valve is blown.

21:01.495 --> 21:02.660
What? What does that mean?

21:02.660 --> 21:03.858
It’s time to have this baby.

21:03.858 --> 21:05.330
Page Dr. Lin!

21:05.330 --> 21:07.165
-Mina, what’s happening?
\h\h-We’re gonna proceed

21:07.165 --> 21:10.033
immediately with the C-section
with Dr. Lin, and then you’re

21:10.033 --> 21:11.825
\h\h\hgonna go into surgery
right after with Dr. Austin.

21:11.825 --> 21:13.165
It’s my heart?
Listen to me.

21:13.165 --> 21:14.825
Take the baby first.
\h\h\h\h\h\hSave my,

21:14.825 --> 21:17.198
-save my...
\h\h-Adaku?

21:17.198 --> 21:18.528
save my baby.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.693
Adaku?

21:20.693 --> 21:22.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h-(rapid beeping)
-NIC: I still have a pulse,

21:22.264 --> 21:23.924
but she’s hypoxic--
we need to bag her.

21:23.924 --> 21:25.693
\h\h\h-Acute pulmonary edema.
-Get a code team in here now!

21:25.693 --> 21:27.198
-(monitor drones)
-She’s in V tach!

21:27.198 --> 21:29.198
V fib. We lost her pulse.
\h\hStarting compressions!

21:29.198 --> 21:31.198
We got no time to waste--
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hlet’s go.

21:31.198 --> 21:32.594
Where’s Dr. Lin?!

21:34.429 --> 21:36.033
-OR Three is ready for us.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Good.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.792
We need to get this baby out
\h\h\h\has soon as possible.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.429
No, no. Adaku’s coding.
\h\h\hWe save her first,

21:39.429 --> 21:41.033
-then think about the baby.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Negative.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.033
We do that, then the baby dies.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.264
Adaku made her wishes clear.

21:43.264 --> 21:45.132
She said save the baby first.

21:45.132 --> 21:47.693
\h\h\h\h-Austin, I swear,
if you don’t save Adaku...
\h\h\h-Mina! Listen to me.

21:47.693 --> 21:49.858
\h\h\hWe get her on bypass
as Lin delivers the baby.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.264
Then we deal with the valve.

21:51.264 --> 21:53.099
That’s the only way
\hwe save them both.

21:53.099 --> 21:55.495
Trust me.

21:58.759 --> 21:59.924
-How long do you need?
\h\h\h-About a minute.

21:59.924 --> 22:02.132
Ten blade.

22:02.132 --> 22:03.792
Adaku won’t make it.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.264
\h\h\hAUSTIN:
Yes, she will.

22:05.264 --> 22:08.165
\h\h\h\h\hWe just have
to buy her more time.

22:14.297 --> 22:16.363
(whirring)

22:19.099 --> 22:20.528
All right, baby’s out.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.231
Baby’s not breathing.

22:34.594 --> 22:36.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAUSTIN:
Now I’ll prep her for bypass.

22:36.429 --> 22:38.693

Let’s get some blood in here.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.429

22:46.429 --> 22:48.297
Baby’s still not breathing.

22:48.297 --> 22:49.429
\h\h\hNEONATOLOGIST:
Okay, let’s bag her.

22:49.429 --> 22:51.198
(Nic sighs)

22:51.198 --> 22:53.363
-Heart rate’s still in the 50s.
-She’s been hypoxic too long.

22:53.363 --> 22:54.660
Okay, I’m starting compressions.

22:55.924 --> 22:57.660

\h\h\h\hWe saved the baby,

23:45.495 --> 23:46.924
You should have operated her
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hhours ago.

23:46.924 --> 23:48.330
-We shouldn’t have waited.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-NIC: Mina,

23:48.330 --> 23:49.858
\h\hthat’s not helping.
He made the right call.

23:49.858 --> 23:51.429
\h\hAdaku and the baby
are both still alive.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.165

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-I’m staying.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.693
-No more mistakes on my watch.
\h\h\h-There were no mistakes!

That baby is going to have
her mother, and I’m going

23:57.858 --> 23:59.891

24:10.858 --> 24:12.429
\h-Looks good.
-AUSTIN: What?

24:12.429 --> 24:13.858

Let’s start weaning her

She’s undergone

Her heart was already weak

24:25.528 --> 24:28.033

30:33.759 --> 30:35.000
I’ve been a surgeon a long time.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.594
I’ve seen attendings
\h\h\hcome in drunk,

30:36.594 --> 30:38.594
I’ve seen ’em fall asleep
\h\hfrom sheer exhaustion.

30:38.594 --> 30:39.759
\h\hI’ve seen incompetence
and heroics and everything

30:39.759 --> 30:42.693
in between, but this
defies description.

30:42.693 --> 30:47.264
\hYour patient nearly died, you
left him wide open on the table.

30:47.264 --> 30:50.363
You want an attaboy
for saving one life?

30:50.363 --> 30:52.594
I save dozens every day,
\hhundreds by the week.

30:52.594 --> 30:55.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Get over it.
\h\h\h\h\h-Do you save them
or manage not to kill them?

30:55.297 --> 30:58.594
\hWheeling a patient with
a blown brain into the ICU

30:58.594 --> 31:00.924
\hand hooking them up to a vent
is not a life-saving procedure.

31:00.924 --> 31:02.594
-It’s abusive.
-(laughs): Oh.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.264
Look who’s talking.

31:04.264 --> 31:06.099
One glass of ten-year-old
bourbon and your residents

31:06.099 --> 31:09.957
cannot wait to share the tales
\h\h\h\h\hof the mighty HODAD.

31:09.957 --> 31:11.330
Hands of Death and Destruction.

31:11.330 --> 31:12.627
That is what they call you,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hisn’t it?

31:12.627 --> 31:14.693
\h\hPatients dead after
a routine appendectomy,

31:14.693 --> 31:16.693
catching fire in the OR?

31:16.693 --> 31:18.957
Yeah, I’ve made mistakes,
\h\h\h\h\hbut I was there.

31:18.957 --> 31:21.957
With my staff in the OR,
\h\h\hnot off joyriding

31:21.957 --> 31:23.825
\h\h\hwhile my patients
were left incapacitated.

31:23.825 --> 31:26.033
\hI have saved the lives
of kings and princesses

31:26.033 --> 31:27.462
from every corner of this world.

31:27.462 --> 31:28.957
They worship me.

31:28.957 --> 31:31.660
\h\h\hThey want to name
their children after me.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.495
They will never forget who I am.

31:33.495 --> 31:35.297
-But it seems that you have.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-No.

31:35.297 --> 31:36.825
\h\h\h\h\h\hYou’re the one
who’s forgotten who I am:

31:36.825 --> 31:39.132
chief of surgery and your boss.

31:39.132 --> 31:41.495
You will answer to the board.

31:49.495 --> 31:51.693
Yeah? What do you think?

31:51.693 --> 31:54.330
\h\hWow. Nic let you out
of the house like that?

31:54.330 --> 31:56.594
(laughs)

31:56.594 --> 31:58.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDEVON:
What are you doing?

31:58.264 --> 32:00.000
I’ve gotten a free sandwich here
ever since I started.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.858
-These guys love me.
\h\h-Is that right?

32:02.858 --> 32:06.330
Let me guess, fried egg.

32:06.330 --> 32:09.330
Yeah. How’d you know that?

32:09.330 --> 32:10.429
\h\h\hCONRAD:
They like you,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.099
but they don’t like you
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthat much.

32:12.099 --> 32:15.165
Have you been buying my lunch
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthis whole time?

32:15.165 --> 32:17.693
\hYeah. Something my resident
did for me. It’s a tradition.

32:17.693 --> 32:20.363
\h\hYou just pay it forward,
do the same for your intern.

32:20.363 --> 32:23.264
It’s a way to say thank you

32:23.264 --> 32:26.264
for all the hard work
\h\h\h\h\hthey put in.

32:26.264 --> 32:29.660
\h\h\hLast one.
Better enjoy it.

32:38.297 --> 32:40.264
Listen.

32:42.363 --> 32:43.792
I want you to know that...

32:43.792 --> 32:46.660
I do know.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.594
Hey, I want to show you
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hsomething.

32:58.264 --> 33:01.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h-You mean...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:01.297 --> 33:02.495
(exhales sharply)

33:02.495 --> 33:05.264
Wow.

33:05.264 --> 33:07.165
-Congratulations.
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Aah!

33:07.165 --> 33:09.627
I haven’t... asked her yet.

33:09.627 --> 33:11.429
I just have to find
\hthe right moment.

33:11.429 --> 33:13.099
-She needs to say yes.
\h\h\h\h-Oh, she will.

33:13.099 --> 33:15.330
You guys are inevitable.

33:16.924 --> 33:18.594
No, I know how I feel about Nic.

33:18.594 --> 33:21.495
That’s never changed.
It never will change.

33:23.099 --> 33:25.660
She’s everything.

33:27.594 --> 33:30.099
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:30.099 --> 33:31.825
Oh, no, no.

33:31.825 --> 33:33.660
Come on.

33:34.660 --> 33:37.495
\h(chuckles)
How’s Mina?

33:37.495 --> 33:39.330
\h\h\h\h\h\h(sighs)
Rumpled and grumpy.

33:39.330 --> 33:42.924
\h\h\h\hShe slept in a chair
by Adaku’s side last night.

33:42.924 --> 33:45.132
And Adaku?

33:45.132 --> 33:48.099
Critical.

33:48.099 --> 33:49.924
She’s intubated and sedated.

33:49.924 --> 33:51.297
It’s gonna be a long road ahead.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.099
She’ll be in the hospital
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor a while.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.033
The baby, on the other hand,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.594
might be able to go home
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hin a week.

33:57.594 --> 33:59.858
With Mina.

34:01.198 --> 34:03.330
Wow, that’s a scary thought.

34:03.330 --> 34:06.726
(chuckles)
\h\hHo...

34:23.792 --> 34:28.528
I’m sorry... for earlier.

34:28.528 --> 34:30.726
The things I said.

34:34.198 --> 34:35.825
But I was not wrong.

34:35.825 --> 34:37.429
\h\h\hIf we had taken her
to surgery first thing...

34:37.429 --> 34:39.396
Mina, stop.

34:42.660 --> 34:46.330
Taking care of her was my job.

34:48.660 --> 34:51.825
Look, I get it.

34:51.825 --> 34:54.660
It’s been a rough 24 hours
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor everybody.

34:56.693 --> 34:59.726
And you have another challenge
\h\h\h\h\h\hahead of you now.

35:04.825 --> 35:06.330
She’s just so small.

35:16.858 --> 35:18.858
The surgery went perfectly.

35:18.858 --> 35:21.264
\h\h\hWe’re hopeful
for a full recovery.

35:21.264 --> 35:23.165
That’s wonderful.

35:25.363 --> 35:28.264
How you feeling?

35:28.264 --> 35:32.429
\h\hI’ve been better,
but I can’t complain.

35:32.429 --> 35:35.198
Still here, right?
\h\h\h\h(chuckles)

35:35.198 --> 35:37.264
I know I have you
to thank for that.

35:37.264 --> 35:40.495
Well, the person we have
\hto thank is the donor.

35:42.429 --> 35:45.099
\h\h\h\h\hHe gave you
a very precious gift.

35:45.099 --> 35:48.495
\h\hLook, I promise
I learned my lesson.

35:49.924 --> 35:52.495
\h\h\h\hI’m not gonna make
that mistake again, okay?

35:54.594 --> 35:58.330
I’d like to be sure of that.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.330
\h\h\h\h\hI want you to start
by being honest with your mom.

36:04.759 --> 36:06.594
-I can’t do that.
\h-No, no, no, no.

36:06.594 --> 36:09.594
It’s okay. It’s important.
\h\h\h\hShe needs to know.

36:09.594 --> 36:14.528
\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd this is why...
I want you to get counseling.

36:14.528 --> 36:16.297
You need to talk to someone
\h\h\h\habout why you tried

36:16.297 --> 36:18.759
to take your own life to make
sure it doesn’t happen again.

36:31.429 --> 36:33.627
Are you sure the transplant
\h\h\h\h\hsurgeon heard you?

36:33.627 --> 36:35.330
Positive.

36:35.330 --> 36:36.627
-What did he say?
\h\h\h\h-Nothing.

36:36.627 --> 36:38.264
\h\h\h\h\hHe walked away
without speaking to me.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.462
Okay, this is bad.

36:40.462 --> 36:42.000
Well, maybe, maybe not.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.429
\h\h\h\hWe don’t know
if he’ll tell anyone.

36:43.429 --> 36:44.759
The surgery’s done,
the outcome is good.

36:44.759 --> 36:46.297
They can’t turn back the clock.

36:46.297 --> 36:47.957
This shouldn’t even
\h\h\h\hbe an issue.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.792
There are no guidelines
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfrom UNOS

36:49.792 --> 36:51.198
telling transplant centers

36:51.198 --> 36:53.462
\h\hwhether to give organs to
someone who attempted suicide.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.363
Transplant protocol varies
from hospital to hospital.

36:56.363 --> 36:59.132
\hIf Tyler had gone
to Atlanta General,

36:59.132 --> 37:01.462
they would have approved
\hthe transplant surgery

37:01.462 --> 37:03.594
\h\h\h\h\h\hwith virtually
no questions asked, but...

37:03.594 --> 37:07.363
Chastain doesn’t work that way.

37:07.363 --> 37:10.396
So what do we do now?

37:11.825 --> 37:14.264
Behave as if nothing happened.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.594
\h\hWhere’s the board?
I requested a meeting.

37:33.594 --> 37:35.198
Your request was denied.

37:35.198 --> 37:36.660
Well, you can’t do that.

37:36.660 --> 37:38.033
It’s in the hospital charter.

37:38.033 --> 37:40.330
The chief of surgery
\h\h\hmay request...

37:40.330 --> 37:42.891
\h\hYou’ve been stripped
of that title, Dr. Bell.

37:45.033 --> 37:46.528
What’d you say?

37:46.528 --> 37:50.858
Dr. Cain is Chastain’s
new chief of surgery.

37:50.858 --> 37:55.264
All future requests
will go through him.
