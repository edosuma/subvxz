00:02.610 --> 00:04.144
Hey, chief. What are you up to?

00:04.178 --> 00:07.047
Oh, man. I am getting
the hell out of here just as

00:07.081 --> 00:09.349
fast as these crippled
old legs can carry me.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.351
This is my day off, bitches!

00:11.419 --> 00:13.253
Whoo! Yeah.

00:13.321 --> 00:17.491
Yeah, I give her about an hour to
figure out an excuse to get back in here.

00:17.525 --> 00:19.426
She hates leaving here, you know?

00:19.460 --> 00:22.129
Are you really asking if I know?

00:22.163 --> 00:23.696
Or is that just rhetorical?

00:23.764 --> 00:27.700
You don't give a rat's ass as to
whether or not I know or don't

00:27.735 --> 00:30.703
know about how chief hates
leaving this place!

00:30.738 --> 00:31.885
Damn you!

00:37.878 --> 00:39.079
Come on.

00:39.113 --> 00:40.280
Take it easy, you mamaluke.

00:41.349 --> 00:42.782
I need to check in.

00:42.816 --> 00:43.450
Ooh.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.617
We only treat children here.

00:44.685 --> 00:46.319
I don't see an issue here.

00:46.354 --> 00:47.421
This person's 5 years old.

00:47.455 --> 00:48.621
Yeah. Dori.

00:48.656 --> 00:52.526
Um, let's check in this child...
This <i>5-year-old </i> child who I'm

00:52.560 --> 00:54.461
sure has I.D. proving his age.

00:56.130 --> 00:56.729
Oh.

00:56.797 --> 01:01.468
I always have trouble guessing people's
ages -- mostly with hilarious results.

01:01.502 --> 01:02.269
You'll see.

01:02.336 --> 01:04.837
Now, what seems to be
the problem, young man?

01:04.905 --> 01:06.706
I fell on a bullet.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.375
Kids.

01:08.409 --> 01:10.877
Well, you're making
real progress, Douglas.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.447
Tell me, does it hurt when I do this?

01:13.481 --> 01:15.815
You are worthless.

01:15.883 --> 01:17.817
Yes. That hurts.

01:18.553 --> 01:21.254
Did someone say they
needed a hero or is that just

01:21.289 --> 01:23.390
the theme music that's
always playing in my head?

01:23.424 --> 01:26.460
Detective Chance Briggs, you
velvet, poker-playing bulldog --

01:26.527 --> 01:28.161
What's my old partner doing here?

01:28.196 --> 01:30.464
I got put on desk
duty for losing my hearing.

01:30.531 --> 01:32.699
Since when is hearing
important for a cop?

01:32.733 --> 01:35.668
Since a juvie perp yelled
"don't shoot" and I shot him.

01:35.703 --> 01:38.472
I can't believe they would strip Lt.
Chance Briggs of

01:38.506 --> 01:40.373
his badge because he
can't hear a little.

01:40.441 --> 01:43.810
And can you believe they would strip Lt.
Chance Briggs -- you just

01:43.844 --> 01:44.844
said that, didn't you?

01:44.878 --> 01:45.645
I did.

01:45.679 --> 01:48.482
I thought you did but
my hearing is completely shot,

01:48.516 --> 01:49.649
just like that juvie perp.

01:49.683 --> 01:52.452
So you're taking the next
logical step -- coming here

01:52.487 --> 01:54.488
to become a doctor so
you can cure yourself.

01:54.522 --> 01:56.556
If I heard you
correctly, yes, I am.

01:56.591 --> 01:58.391
Well, allow me
to show you around.

01:58.459 --> 02:00.860
I'm going to teach you everything
you need to know about doctoring.

02:00.928 --> 02:01.828
It's a date!

02:02.663 --> 02:03.497
But not a <i>date</i> date.

02:03.531 --> 02:05.298
I know.

02:06.601 --> 02:07.601
Pssst! Pssst!

02:07.668 --> 02:09.769
Sy! Sy!

02:09.803 --> 02:12.305
Eh, eh. Eeeeeh!

02:12.373 --> 02:15.775
On behalf of the family, here's a little
something for the hospitality, eh?

02:15.843 --> 02:16.843
It's money!

02:16.877 --> 02:18.145
Hey, Dookie!

02:18.212 --> 02:19.279
You ruined the surprise!

02:19.313 --> 02:21.381
Listen. Could we
not make food in here?

02:21.415 --> 02:22.215
Sy, relax.

02:22.283 --> 02:22.782
It's nothing!

02:22.816 --> 02:25.585
We just got a little Italian
sausage, some peppers, some

02:25.620 --> 02:29.156
ground beef, some tomatoes, some
onions, some gabagool, some

02:29.223 --> 02:31.758
basil, some oregano,
sautéed chicken livers.

02:31.792 --> 02:35.428
I got some beautiful wasabi,
olive oil, sliced, thin garlic

02:35.463 --> 02:38.298
and a pinch of salt to
taste -- it's nothin'!

02:38.332 --> 02:39.499
Yeah, Sy.

02:39.567 --> 02:40.700
You worry too much.

02:40.768 --> 02:42.335
It's bad for your pores.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.436
Hey, do me a favor.

02:43.504 --> 02:46.606
Take this and go build a new wing.

02:46.674 --> 02:47.407
Or a leg!

02:47.441 --> 02:48.408
Or a thigh!

02:48.442 --> 02:49.242
Or an addition!

02:49.310 --> 02:50.510
Or an annex!

02:51.745 --> 02:52.479
Dummy.

02:52.513 --> 02:53.613
We're making a joke here.

02:53.681 --> 02:57.517
- No, you -- you said...
- You broke the joke, you stunad!

02:58.619 --> 02:59.686
My own kid.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.788
I'm way over my head.

03:01.855 --> 03:03.356
<i>I hate days off.</i>

03:03.424 --> 03:04.791
<i>I'm addicted to doctoring.</i>

03:04.858 --> 03:07.894
<i>When I was young, I ran a
shoe-shine stand at a local</i>

03:07.961 --> 03:10.397
<i>hospital just so I could be around it.</i>

03:10.431 --> 03:13.500
<i>Now I spend my days off
watching kids, hoping they hurt</i>

03:13.534 --> 03:15.402
<i>themselves.</i>

03:17.505 --> 03:18.438
<i>Yes!!</i>

03:18.506 --> 03:19.806
<i>Don't worry, little girl!</i>

03:19.873 --> 03:20.707
<i>I'm a doctor!</i>

03:20.774 --> 03:21.774
<i>I can save you!</i>

03:21.809 --> 03:22.709
<i>You're choking!</i>

03:22.776 --> 03:27.447
<i>I will give you the gift of life!</i>

03:27.481 --> 03:29.249
<i>Dueling days off,
I guess, huh, chief?</i>

03:29.317 --> 03:30.250
<i>Tough luck.</i>

03:30.284 --> 03:32.819
<i>Now, why don't you go
get your shine box?</i>

<i>Huh? Ugh!</i>

03:45.633 --> 03:47.467
<i>Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!</i>

03:54.842 --> 03:56.643
<i>Aah!</i>

03:56.711 --> 03:57.544
<i>Oh!</i>

03:57.578 --> 03:58.545
<i>Aah!</i>

04:01.382 --> 04:05.285
<i>We got a 10-year-old
girl with abdominal pains.</i>

04:05.319 --> 04:06.453
<i>What's the call?</i>

04:06.487 --> 04:13.393
<i>- Well, I guess I would...
- No, Briggs. Come on.</i>

04:13.427 --> 04:14.294
<i>What's the call?</i>

04:14.362 --> 04:16.296
<i>Think!</i>

04:16.329 --> 04:22.302
<i>Okay...I do something like...
I'd put her on a monoclonal</i>

04:22.370 --> 04:26.806
<i>antibody full-service platform
and an h7n7-ha Elisa kit.</i>

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

04:27.875 --> 04:30.477
<i>You were hesitant at first, but
once you got going, you showed a</i>

04:30.511 --> 04:34.013
<i>surprising knowledge of medicine.</i>

04:34.047 --> 04:37.317
<i>Now you're giving a look like,
"hey, I think I know that guy."</i>

04:37.385 --> 04:40.587
<i>Man, I am really nailing what's
happening from moment to moment.</i>

04:40.621 --> 04:41.655
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

04:41.722 --> 04:43.022
<i>I'm going to go get the papers.</i>

04:43.056 --> 04:43.757
<i>That is all.</i>

04:43.791 --> 04:44.491
<i>That is all.</i>

04:44.525 --> 04:46.393
<i>You guys are all so big for five.</i>

04:46.460 --> 04:47.927
<i>What are your mommies feeding you?</i>

04:47.961 --> 04:48.662
<i>Gabagool.</i>

04:48.729 --> 04:51.864
<i>You guys are like Popeye
and these gabagools are spinach.</i>

04:51.899 --> 04:52.766
<i>What is gabagool?</i>

04:52.833 --> 04:53.667
<i>I don't know.</i>

04:53.701 --> 04:54.668
<i>It could be spinach.</i>

04:54.702 --> 04:56.869
<i>Cat, I am in way over my head.</i>

04:56.904 --> 04:59.939
<i>Every time I go into that
room, they pull me in deeper.</i>

05:00.007 --> 05:03.576
<i>It's like I want to get out of
that room, but they keep pulling</i>

05:03.611 --> 05:04.944
<i>me back in...to the room.</i>

05:04.978 --> 05:08.415
<i>Now, Sy, you just need
to know how to speak to them.</i>

05:08.482 --> 05:09.749
<i>Let me show you. Watch.</i>

05:09.784 --> 05:10.483
<i>Hi.</i>

05:10.518 --> 05:12.686
<i>I'm Dr. Cat Black and --
Shhh!</i>

05:12.753 --> 05:13.687
<i>My dad's napping.</i>

05:13.754 --> 05:15.755
<i>He naps for five minutes every hour.</i>

05:15.790 --> 05:16.756
<i>He says it's good for the skin.</i>

05:16.791 --> 05:18.558
<i>Really? Does he have
any advice for split ends?</i>

05:18.592 --> 05:19.492
<i>Ooh.</i>

05:19.527 --> 05:21.594
<i>Yeah, actually, he says
you should only brush your</i>

05:21.662 --> 05:24.063
<i>hair once a day, and only in the
middle of the night when your</i>

05:24.097 --> 05:26.132
<i>hair is asleep so you
could sneak up on it.</i>

05:26.166 --> 05:27.967
<i>Yeah, but, see, that
wouldn't work for me because my</i>

05:28.001 --> 05:29.602
<i>hair has insomnia and always has.</i>

05:29.670 --> 05:31.571
<i>You're really fun to talk to.</i>

05:31.605 --> 05:32.339
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:32.406 --> 05:35.775
<i>It's funny -- I came in here
to broker peace for Sy, but...</i>

05:35.810 --> 05:38.077
<i>God, you're not like these other guys.</i>

05:38.145 --> 05:40.680
<i>You've got kind eyes
and no sense of humor.</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:41.514
<i>What's your name?</i>

05:41.582 --> 05:42.982
<i>Dookie.</i>

05:43.016 --> 05:44.417
<i>Okay.</i>

05:44.452 --> 05:45.418
<i>Dookie.</i>

05:45.453 --> 05:46.052
<i>Dookie.</i>

05:46.086 --> 05:46.720
<i>Wow.</i>

05:46.787 --> 05:47.887
<i>What's your name?</i>

05:47.921 --> 05:48.521
<i>Cat.</i>

05:48.589 --> 05:50.423
<i>Cat -- like
the animal, the cat?</i>

05:50.458 --> 05:51.624
<i>Yeah. God, you're cute.</i>

05:51.692 --> 05:53.893
<i>The only thing I don't like
about you is that wife-beater.</i>

05:53.961 --> 05:55.061
<i>You mean my dad?</i>

05:55.128 --> 05:55.695
<i>No, I know.</i>

05:55.763 --> 05:56.763
<i>Okay! I'm up!</i>

05:56.797 --> 05:59.065
<i>Let's go! Back to business!</i>

05:59.099 --> 06:00.800
<i>I'll see you around, Dookie.</i>

06:00.835 --> 06:03.536
<i>Hey, not -- not if I see
you around first, before you</i>

06:03.604 --> 06:04.136
<i>see me</i> around.

06:04.171 --> 06:06.873
Hi. Some of the parents are
getting a little suspicious.

06:06.907 --> 06:08.608
You need more money, Sy?

06:08.642 --> 06:09.542
Give him some money.

06:09.610 --> 06:10.510
No. No. No.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.711
Don't -- don't do that. No.

06:11.779 --> 06:14.447
I-I feel like I've made a
mistake, and I mean this is the

06:14.515 --> 06:16.048
nicest way -- I need you to leave.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.717
Sylvester Hiram Mittleman.

06:17.785 --> 06:18.985
That's Italian, ain't it?

06:19.052 --> 06:20.152
It's Sicilian.

06:20.187 --> 06:21.554
Well, okay.

06:21.622 --> 06:23.890
I am now officially gonna
open up the books.

06:23.924 --> 06:26.893
You -- you are now... a made man.

06:26.927 --> 06:27.527
No.

06:27.561 --> 06:34.100
Look. What's yours...is mine.

06:34.134 --> 06:37.737
Never go against the family, Sy.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.105
Capiche?

06:39.172 --> 06:41.808
Oh. Papa Senori.

06:45.679 --> 06:49.816
This guy looks just like crime
boss Frankie Ciavaterri, but this guy

06:49.884 --> 06:52.886
is 5 and Frankie has
got to be at least 65.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.186
It doesn't add up.

06:54.221 --> 06:55.187
I'm gonna question him.

06:55.255 --> 06:57.457
Ah, Briggs, it's
not your job anymore.

06:57.491 --> 06:59.726
Briggs, did you hear me?

06:59.760 --> 07:01.828
Yeah, I did.

07:01.862 --> 07:04.196
I was just pretending not to.

07:07.701 --> 07:09.101
Holster that weapon, doctor.

07:09.136 --> 07:11.003
In this hospital, we don't
fight with bullets.

07:11.038 --> 07:12.104
We fight with these.

07:12.139 --> 07:13.039
Whoops. Wrong hand.

07:13.106 --> 07:14.173
We fight with <i>these.</i>

07:14.207 --> 07:15.542
<i>Ah, pills.</i>

07:15.576 --> 07:16.208
<i>That hits home.</i>

07:16.276 --> 07:18.478
<i>Now, let's go save some ass.</i>

07:22.983 --> 07:25.585
<i>I had to get the kid
to the hospital, punch in,</i>

07:25.619 --> 07:27.954
<i>treat her, locate her family,
get back to the park, get</i>

07:27.988 --> 07:31.591
<i>Blake's body, and dissolve
it in a drum of acid.</i>

07:33.828 --> 07:35.227
<i>Bullet's lodged in his shoulder.</i>

07:35.295 --> 07:36.128
<i>He lost a lot of blood.</i>

07:36.196 --> 07:37.129
<i>I'm gonna need more gauze.</i>

07:37.164 --> 07:38.565
<i>Briggs -- more gauze!</i>

07:38.599 --> 07:39.866
<i>Get your own gauze!</i>

07:39.934 --> 07:41.501
<i>I'm a cop, Owen -- not a doctor.</i>

07:41.535 --> 07:44.136
<i>And if that means I have to lie
to my bosses that I have the</i>

07:44.204 --> 07:46.038
<i>ability to perceive sound, so be it!</i>

07:47.174 --> 07:49.943
<i>Officer Chance
Briggs requesting backup.</i>

07:49.977 --> 07:51.945
<i>We got a 10-87 over at Childrens!</i>

07:52.012 --> 07:52.779
<i>Hey!</i>

07:52.813 --> 07:53.212
<i>Oh.</i>

07:53.280 --> 07:54.213
<i>Human cat.</i>

07:54.247 --> 07:55.147
<i>Hey, dookie.</i>

07:55.182 --> 07:57.283
<i>My dad says that
I should ask you out.</i>

07:57.317 --> 07:58.050
<i>Really?</i>

07:58.085 --> 08:00.152
<i>Are you sure your family
won't care if we dated?</i>

08:00.187 --> 08:02.655
<i>Because, keep in my mind, I'm
Jewish and I'm terrible at</i>

08:02.690 --> 08:03.289
<i>keeping secrets.</i>

08:03.323 --> 08:06.225
<i>Why would they care about that?</i>

08:06.293 --> 08:07.293
<i>Oh, dookie.</i>

08:07.327 --> 08:08.227
<i>Eeeh-o.</i>

08:08.295 --> 08:10.864
<i>Oh. Mmm.</i>

08:10.898 --> 08:12.966
<i>W-wow!</i>

08:13.000 --> 08:15.802
<i>I can't wait to tell my dad I'm
in love with some blabbermouth</i>

08:15.870 --> 08:17.770
<i>Jew broad who kisses
like a black chick!</i>

08:18.839 --> 08:21.875
<i>I know she's in there!</i>

08:21.942 --> 08:24.611
<i>Everyone, there is a whore
in recovery room 2!</i>

08:24.645 --> 08:25.979
<i>How you doin'?</i>

08:26.046 --> 08:27.780
<i>You're under arrest.</i>

08:27.815 --> 08:28.748
<i>No. No.</i>

08:28.782 --> 08:29.849
<i>He's not like them.</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:30.783
<i>He's different.</i>

08:30.851 --> 08:32.251
<i>No. I'm not, Cat.</i>

08:32.318 --> 08:33.886
<i>But you have such a kind heart.</i>

08:33.953 --> 08:35.321
<i>I have a learning disability.</i>

08:35.355 --> 08:36.255
<i>Tomato, tomahto.</i>

08:36.289 --> 08:37.524
<i>Who says "tomahto"?</i>

08:37.591 --> 08:39.692
<i>Wealthy people, British
waiters, Frasier's brother --</i>

08:39.727 --> 08:41.861
<i>I have been making my
gravy since I'm little -- I</i>

08:41.895 --> 08:43.696
<i>never heard no one say "tomahto."</i>

08:43.764 --> 08:48.067
<i>Goodbye, human cat -- or in
your people's language, "meow."</i>

08:48.135 --> 08:50.336
<i>Meow.</i>

08:52.606 --> 08:54.774
<i>Ah-ha. Finally.</i>

08:55.910 --> 08:58.244
<i>Uh-oh -- the pigs.</i>

08:58.913 --> 09:01.080
<i>Briggs, I took
you under my wing...</i>

09:01.148 --> 09:03.249
<i>Owen, I'm a partially deaf cop.</i>

09:03.283 --> 09:06.185
<i>Cut me open with a scalpel or
shoot me with a .38, but root</i>

09:06.219 --> 09:09.155
<i>around inside that bloody hole
that you just made and you'll</i>

09:09.189 --> 09:11.791
<i>find that I'm police officer
through and through.</i>

09:11.825 --> 09:13.826
<i>Officer!</i>

09:13.861 --> 09:14.961
<i>Oh, thank God!</i>

09:14.995 --> 09:16.062
<i>Chief tried to kill me!</i>

09:16.096 --> 09:18.698
<i>Luckily, she missed every
major organ by millimeters!</i>

09:18.732 --> 09:21.167
<i>But I could easily have been
thought of by most as dead!</i>

09:21.201 --> 09:22.635
<i>What did you say?</i>

09:22.703 --> 09:23.269
<i>You're dead?!</i>

09:23.303 --> 09:24.003
<i>No.</i>

09:24.071 --> 09:26.739
<i>Officers, he's dead,
and he's still walking!</i>

09:26.774 --> 09:27.740
<i>He must be a zombie!</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:28.340
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

09:28.375 --> 09:29.341
<i>No!</i>

09:30.377 --> 09:31.644
<i>Briggs! Briggs! Briggs!</i>

09:31.712 --> 09:33.245
<i>Briggs, you got it all wrong!</i>

09:33.280 --> 09:34.814
<i>You're right.</i>

09:34.848 --> 09:37.016
<i>We have to destroy the zombie's brain!</i>

09:37.084 --> 09:40.386
<i>Go for the head!</i>

09:41.288 --> 09:44.390
<i>You are under arrest for turning
Dr. Blake Downs into a zombie.</i>

09:44.424 --> 09:45.191
<i>What?!</i>

09:45.225 --> 09:46.292
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

09:46.359 --> 09:47.193
<i>He's not a zombie!</i>

09:47.227 --> 09:48.761
<i>Not anymore, he's not.</i>

09:48.829 --> 09:50.997
<i>What are you, deaf?</i>

09:51.031 --> 09:52.198
<i>No.</i>

09:52.232 --> 09:53.165
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

09:54.768 --> 09:56.102
<i>This meeting has come to order.</i>

09:56.136 --> 09:58.104
<i>We have come to a decision.</i>

09:58.138 --> 10:01.641
<i>Chief, the board finds
you innocent of turning</i>

10:01.675 --> 10:03.843
<i>Dr. Blake Downs into a zombie.</i>

10:03.877 --> 10:07.914
<i>But we find you guilty of
attempting to practice medicine</i>

10:07.948 --> 10:09.015
<i>on your day off.</i>

10:09.083 --> 10:12.952
<i>Your medical license is hereby
revoked for the period of one</i>

10:13.020 --> 10:13.653
<i>month.</i>

10:17.691 --> 10:20.292
<i>The hardest thing for
me was to leave the life.</i>

10:20.360 --> 10:21.661
<i>I loved being a doctor.</i>

10:21.729 --> 10:22.829
<i>We did what we wanted.</i>

10:22.863 --> 10:25.865
<i>When I was out of patients to
treat, I'd just go out and hurt</i>

10:25.899 --> 10:27.233
<i>some kids and treat them.</i>

10:27.300 --> 10:30.937
<i>It was all ours for the taking.</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:32.238
<i>Now it's all over.</i>

10:32.305 --> 10:36.943
<i>And I have to live the rest
of this month like a shnook.</i>
