WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:09.968
Watch out!

00:10.051 --> 00:11.761
-Lift with your legs.
-I am lifting with my legs.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.389
-Also lift with your arms.
- Is Horse Professor okay?

00:14.472 --> 00:15.432
Nothing to see here!

00:15.515 --> 00:21.479
He just passed out from pride!
Because you kids are so talented!

00:23.148 --> 00:24.941
You think he passed out
from embarrassment?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.944
-Because the kids are not talented.
-What happened?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.696
He was getting off a phone call.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.449
I had some constructive criticism
about his play.

00:32.532 --> 00:35.535
I tried a compliment sandwich
by starting with some praise,

00:35.618 --> 00:36.995
but he passed out!

00:37.078 --> 00:38.329
Just goes to show,

00:38.413 --> 00:40.999
you never know how much time you have
with someone,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.626
so you should always say
the bad stuff first.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.004
-BoJack! Your play sucked!

00:46.087 --> 00:47.380
They found out. I didn't--

00:47.464 --> 00:48.965
-It's not true.
-What's not true?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.341
I need to-- Air.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.303
<i>♪ For he's our trusty director ♪</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.638
No. They can't know.
I didn't even do anything.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.556
-It's--
-Slow down.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.016
Why don't you tell us what happened?

00:58.099 --> 01:02.103
Okay, I'll tell you.
But you can't talk to anyone.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.104
No reporters.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.149
BoJack, it's okay.
No one's gonna talk to any--

01:06.232 --> 01:09.819
Reporters? With questions about
my good friend, BoJack Horseman?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.946
I'd be delighted to talk!

02:09.087 --> 02:12.132
Oh, Baxter,
my endlessly encouraging enfianced.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.385
I'm thrilled to report our return
from a prolonged New Mexican exodus.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.012
True, Max and I shared lodging
to husband our expenditures,

02:18.096 --> 02:20.932
and true, too, we showered together
one night when the tank broke down

02:21.015 --> 02:23.852
and the hot water was scarce,
but other than those mild inconveniences,

02:23.935 --> 02:25.228
the fact-finding mission went as fine

02:25.311 --> 02:26.813
as the print at the bottom
of a contract,

02:26.896 --> 02:28.857
and we're close as ever
to sewing things up.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.901
So, BoJack sold the restaurant
to Joey Pogo and me,

02:31.985 --> 02:36.197
and we relaunched it with
my fiancée Pickles as a themed eatery.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.240
What is the theme?

02:37.323 --> 02:40.326
Pickles wanted small plates,
Joey wanted lazy Susans,

02:40.410 --> 02:43.621
and I wanted the theme to be my face
is on the front of the menu.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.290
So, we did all three!

02:45.373 --> 02:47.292
-What's the big idea?
-I'm in the middle of eating!

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
Huh? It's the perfect compromise

02:49.460 --> 02:52.547
because everybody got what they wanted,
and nobody had to compromise!

02:52.630 --> 02:56.176
-And why is it called Ele-fee-no?
-Ele-fi-no.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.511
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!

02:58.595 --> 03:00.430
I know this last story
is taking its sweet time,

03:00.513 --> 03:02.932
but once we can tie down
this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn

03:03.016 --> 03:05.268
on the night of her death,
we'll know he procured the final blow,

03:05.351 --> 03:07.687
the blow being not blow but horse,
a scoop in itself,

03:07.770 --> 03:11.983
but I believe the larger story is--
Oh, but here I am bending your ear.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.487
Your everlasting patience inspires me.
Do return my call. This is Paige Sinclair.

03:18.907 --> 03:23.328
-And then I took the boat back to LA.
-That's it? How's that a story?

03:23.411 --> 03:26.873
You did nothing illegal, and even
the not illegal thing, you didn't even do.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.792
And yet this thing continues
to haunt me, I--

03:29.876 --> 03:32.253
-Because it's not about the legality.
- Diane's right.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.088
That story is super sketchy.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.884
-Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.928
-Can Horse Professor come out?

03:40.011 --> 03:44.307
We won't go to the cast party
unless our fearless teacher comes with us!

03:44.390 --> 03:47.352
Why don't you just have the party here
and he'll pop out when he's ready.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.355
Here's some cash.
Go buy some nice cast party things.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.274
This is gonna be
the best night ever!

03:53.358 --> 03:55.985
Okay, okay, you're right.
I've been sketchy.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.862
But there's no story here. Right?

03:57.946 --> 04:01.407
-Unless New Mexico isn't the story.
-Uh, what?

04:01.491 --> 04:04.369
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch
that story, no one would publish it.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.372
They're working on something bigger.
What did you do this time?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.706
I haven't done anything.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.376
Since I got out of rehab
I have been on my best behavior.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.919
But before rehab...

04:13.002 --> 04:16.047
No. They can't get me on old shit.
I'm a different person now.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.216
-This could be anything.
-Or a combination of things.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.175
They're gonna combo me?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.552
Let's take a beat
and figure out what this story is.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.721
-Todd, earmuffs.
-On it.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.475
BoJack, tell us every bad thing
you ever did.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.311
This is gonna be a long night.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.358
So, what can I tell you about BoJack?
Nothing bad, though.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.151
It's gonna be a short night!

04:37.235 --> 04:41.990
-Right. I-- Your chair, Miss Sinclair.
-Thanks, Mr. Banks.

04:42.073 --> 04:45.076
And thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter,
for taking the time to quench our queries.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.328
This shouldn't take more than
a half hour, max.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.955
-Yes?
-No, not you Max.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.582
-Then who Max?
-No, Max. I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.460
No, you're talking to Max.
I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.962
Now I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.339
-Glad we're all on the same page.
-I beg your pardon.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.925
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we have sitch in the kitch.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.261
It's a dishwash ish.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.473
-The dishwashers all quit?
-It's the small plates.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.725
If we just had bigger plates,

05:08.808 --> 05:10.852
we could get more stuff on them
and we wouldn't need so many.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.687
The point of the small plates

05:12.770 --> 05:15.648
is to curate a personalized
dining experience,

05:15.732 --> 05:19.485
but because of your lazy Susans,
all the plates keep getting spun around

05:19.569 --> 05:21.029
and nobody remembers who ordered what!

05:21.112 --> 05:24.240
Oof! And then there's me,
putting my picture on the menu!

05:24.324 --> 05:27.368
-What? No one cares about that.
-Yeah, the pic's not the problem.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.830
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you start
on those dishes?

05:30.913 --> 05:32.582
You got it, good buddy.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.292
Oh...

05:34.375 --> 05:38.171
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.
Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.339
Sure. But...

05:39.422 --> 05:41.215
Could I talk to you?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.218
How much longer do we have
to keep working with that guy?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.054
I thought you loved Joey Pogo!

05:46.137 --> 05:47.388
I love his music!

05:47.472 --> 05:49.223
He's my second favorite recording artist

05:49.307 --> 05:52.352
after Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats
to study/relax to.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.813
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats
to study/relax to!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.482
And I love you!

05:57.565 --> 06:00.693
But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite!

06:00.777 --> 06:04.238
He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful,
and fake-nice.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.116
You are confident,
refreshingly optimistic,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.410
and wryly sweet
with an ironic self-aware edge

06:09.494 --> 06:12.830
that reads to some as inauthentic,
but I recognize as archly sincere!

06:12.914 --> 06:14.540
Total opposites!

06:14.624 --> 06:18.378
Okay. So, Pogo's not gonna work,
but I guess we keep trying?

06:18.461 --> 06:21.381
I can proposition some young men on set.
That should end well.

06:21.464 --> 06:27.261
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.
I'll try to make it work. For us.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.641
Now, if we're to finish this story,
we need to stay focused.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.976
The last days of Sarah Lynn.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.896
I'm telling you, the story is bigger
than just the one girl!

06:36.979 --> 06:39.649
If we pivot our perspective
so we prove a larger pattern,

06:39.732 --> 06:41.984
we can paint a clearer portrait
of a problematic person

06:42.068 --> 06:44.487
for a page-one profile
that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!

06:44.570 --> 06:46.197
Paige, please! At the rate we're going,

06:46.280 --> 06:47.865
we'll never file the story,
you'll remain unmarried,

06:47.949 --> 06:50.034
and I'll be stuck bickering with you
until the day I die!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.035
Oh, poor baby.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.328
Sorry, where were we?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.206
-We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.
-Oh.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.999
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.126
Oh, brother.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.629
-Would you say BoJack is a good person?
-Unequivocally, more or less.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.006
-More-more or more-less?
-Uh...

07:04.090 --> 07:05.258
Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn--

07:05.341 --> 07:09.178
We're trying to understand if your friend
has ever exhibited certain patterns...

07:09.262 --> 07:12.265
Argyle? Herringbone?
That man can pull off anything!

07:12.348 --> 07:14.016
We're wasting time. Did Sarah Lynn ac--

07:14.100 --> 07:14.934
-Whoa!

07:15.017 --> 07:19.605
I told you not to spin it that fast!
Lazy! Lazy!

07:19.689 --> 07:22.733
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be
washing dishes?

07:24.986 --> 07:27.572
-Hey! Where are you going?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.825
Okay, let the cat out of the bag
so my curiosity can kill it.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.743
What is going on with those two?

07:32.827 --> 07:36.414
That's a personal matter.
I'll tell you all about it!

07:36.497 --> 07:38.541
Cast party! Cast party!

07:38.624 --> 07:41.627
We are having a cast party!

07:41.711 --> 07:43.671
- Yeah!
-They didn't even buy alcohol!

07:43.754 --> 07:45.798
Just a disco ball and some capes?

07:45.882 --> 07:47.717
These are all the bad things
you think you did?

07:47.800 --> 07:51.053
-I swear, this is all I can think of!
-None of these are big stories!

07:51.137 --> 07:53.264
-We all know there are more things.
-Jesus Christ.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.601
What's the point of working on myself
and getting sober and getting better

07:56.684 --> 08:00.021
if no matter what, there are people
out there just waiting to tear me down?

08:00.104 --> 08:01.981
-BoJack, no.
-No, it's not fair.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.859
If you start listing every single thing
everyone's done,

08:04.942 --> 08:06.777
-then everyone's a monster.
-Nobody's--

08:06.861 --> 08:08.237
Who are these reporters, anyway?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.823
They're so perfect? I'll bet
there's dirt on them we could dig up!

08:10.907 --> 08:13.534
-I don't think that's it--
-That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches

08:13.618 --> 08:16.037
what happens when they try to tear
someone down over their past

08:16.120 --> 08:18.789
without even considering the possibility
that he's changed!

08:18.873 --> 08:21.042
-Have you changed?
-Yes, obviously.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.337
Because this feels like old BoJack.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.007
I like the BoJack who's thoughtful
and directs plays

08:28.090 --> 08:32.595
that are emotionally resonant despite
the glaring logical gaps in the plot.

08:32.678 --> 08:36.182
It was a showcase of separate scenes!
There was no plot!

08:36.265 --> 08:39.852
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.
Call me when new BoJack's back.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.275
You didn't do any of the dishes?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.945
Manual labor featuring me
is just not a fruitful collab.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.322
So I just went out
and bought 500 new ones.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.200
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

08:54.283 --> 08:56.994
When I'm with him,
we finish each other's sentences.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.621
Meanwhile, you are always--

08:58.704 --> 09:01.082
Interrupting, just to say
the exact thing that you were going to?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.084
-Yes! It's so--
-Annoying?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.794
Thank you. That's the word.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.089
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.
You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.

09:08.172 --> 09:12.134
What if we just tell Mister
we've formed an emotional bond,

09:12.218 --> 09:13.594
then we can have sex,

09:13.678 --> 09:16.180
and we'll never have
to see each other again!

09:17.139 --> 09:20.893
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?
-I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

09:20.977 --> 09:24.230
That's what got us into this mess
in the first place!

09:29.068 --> 09:30.778
So, as soon as they go to bed
with each other,

09:30.861 --> 09:33.823
we can put this whole thing to bed,
but the problem is...

09:33.906 --> 09:35.616
-She loves him.
-No, the opposite.

09:35.700 --> 09:40.079
No, the opposite of the opposite.
The very thing itself: she loves him.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.163
Why do you say that?

09:41.247 --> 09:44.792
You've got irises, haven't you?
And pupils and corneas?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.461
You might even say you've got
a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

09:47.545 --> 09:48.462
Yes.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.674
So how could you not see the way that
she follows him across the restaurant

09:51.757 --> 09:54.218
like the puppy dog she is?
How they bicker and flirt?

09:54.302 --> 09:57.888
Why would she fall
for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo

09:57.972 --> 10:01.475
when she's already engaged to sweet,
dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

10:01.559 --> 10:03.644
perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.562
Thank you.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.981
She only tolerates that other fellow
because she has to, for work.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.275
Otherwise she finds him
utterly distasteful.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.445
Piggish even! No offense to me.
None taken, of course.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.447
No, she loves him,

10:14.530 --> 10:17.074
though she'd never admit it,
even to herself.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.951
And what about the boy?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.911
Sure, he puts up a front
and picks a good fight,

10:21.245 --> 10:23.706
but to just once hear
those stupid words "I love you"

10:23.789 --> 10:25.207
tumble out of her foolish mouth

10:25.291 --> 10:26.917
would drop his heart down
an elevator shaft

10:27.001 --> 10:29.128
and bounce it back up to his throat.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.839
-Yes?
-Yes.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.967
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.
-Uh...

10:35.051 --> 10:38.262
I... Well, that's all very...

10:38.387 --> 10:40.556
-Back to BoJack!
-And Sarah Lynn.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.975
Would you say
BoJack's relationship with her

10:43.059 --> 10:45.311
ever bordered on inappropriate

10:45.394 --> 10:46.896
in the weeks leading up to her death?

10:46.979 --> 10:50.107
No! They were closer than thieves!
They were thieves, actually.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.400
They broke into my house together,

10:51.484 --> 10:53.527
like great friends do,
and stole our clothes.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.447
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!

10:56.530 --> 10:58.908
But she was able to find another one
shortly thereafter

10:58.991 --> 11:00.284
that looked exactly the same.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.703
-Pardon me.
-Hello. Joseph?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.830
Can I get an announcement drumroll,
please?

11:07.750 --> 11:08.584
Never mind.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.462
Joey and I have developed feelings
for each other.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.380
Oh!

11:14.715 --> 11:17.426
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but--
No, that's wonderful.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.803
It's exactly what we wanted.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.138
It is! So now we make love,

11:21.222 --> 11:24.058
after which we can all get on
with our lives.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.770
Great! This is good.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.359
Look, we're not gonna
figure this out tonight.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.986
Maybe I should just go
to the cast party and try to enjoy--

11:39.907 --> 11:41.409
-Hello?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.620
Yes. Um, speaking.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.416
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair,
of the "Hollywoo Reporter."

11:49.583 --> 11:51.711
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.798
Uh... What night? Did I see BoJack with...

11:55.881 --> 11:57.133
Uh...

11:57.883 --> 12:02.263
Listen, I'd love to talk more,
but, uh, I cut my finger earlier

12:02.346 --> 12:05.516
in a bagel guillotine and I think
I require medical attention, goodbye.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.934
-Bagellotine.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.687
It's Sarah Lynn.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.606
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.282
Well, uh, that was...

12:21.657 --> 12:23.951
-Wow.
-Yeah.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.203
Well, see ya later.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.832
Oh.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.127
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick
to you earlier.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.879
The truth is, since Mr. Peanutbutter

12:34.962 --> 12:36.464
has been such a good friend
and chill hang,

12:36.547 --> 12:38.883
I was nervous
I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

12:38.966 --> 12:42.386
but once we were in it,
it was like we were two naked hearts

12:42.470 --> 12:47.308
raw and exposed but safe in the home
we found in each other.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.227
Yeah. Did you just come up with that?

12:50.436 --> 12:51.896
No, it's from my new song,

12:51.979 --> 12:54.899
"Two Naked Hearts (Raw Dog Remix)."

12:54.982 --> 12:59.069
-Oh. Sounds like another banger.
-Best of luck with your wedding.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.738
One day I hope to have what you two have.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.907
Right now, I couldn't even imagine
getting married.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.784
I can't even commit
to a social media director.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.701
Why not?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.621
I'm just having a hard time finding
someone who gets my brand, you know?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.164
Sexy?

13:10.331 --> 13:13.209
That's exactly right, you totally get me.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.337
So, if you think of anybody who could be
good for the job, let me know, all right?

13:16.420 --> 13:17.922
-I will.
-All right.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.131
I'm headed to the airport now

13:19.215 --> 13:22.676
for another in a series of extravagant
world tours all by myself.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.345
At least I'll have
the empty seat next to me

13:24.428 --> 13:26.305
that I always book for extra comfort.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.723
I'll be at gate six.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.434
I'm just saying this information out loud
so I don't forget it.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.313
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.981
-Wait, Joey!
-Yeah?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.859
Um, here's your jacket back.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.820
Thanks, Pickles.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.035
So Sarah Lynn. That's okay.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.620
-We can spin this.
-Yeah?

13:49.703 --> 13:50.621
What are we spinning?

13:50.704 --> 13:54.625
You went on a bender with her,
at some point you split up and she died.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.919
That's the story, right?

13:57.753 --> 14:01.215
If you want us to help you,
you need to tell us what's coming.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.758
You know what I thought?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.553
The first thing I thought
when I heard Sarah Lynn died?

14:05.636 --> 14:08.013
Poor BoJack,
that he had to find her like that.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.392
That's right.
Poor BoJack, that's the angle!

14:11.475 --> 14:12.643
But then I kept thinking.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.980
I wish I didn't,
but my stupid brain kept thinking.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.815
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

14:17.898 --> 14:21.902
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,
you kept it in your glove compartment.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.487
-Diane...
-I didn't wanna think about it,

14:23.571 --> 14:26.740
but I couldn't help but wonder.
Did you give it to her?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.784
I... Uh...

14:29.410 --> 14:30.286
-Yes.
-And then what?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.912
-You just abandoned her?
-No, I--

14:31.996 --> 14:34.790
You just left her alone,
an addict, with heroin?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.542
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

14:36.625 --> 14:40.004
I was with her the whole time!
I was with her when she died!

14:40.588 --> 14:44.049
-Like "with her" with her?
-In the planetarium.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.303
I left and came back
and pretended I'd found her that way.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.889
I... I've never told anyone that.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.557
That's really bad, BoJack.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.017
Do the reporters know that?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.853
I don't know how they could.
I covered my tracks.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.105
How did you "cover your tracks"?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.778
Oh. Hey. Uh, what's up?

15:04.862 --> 15:07.239
We're doing
end-of-year superlatives,

15:07.323 --> 15:11.201
and we thought it would be cool
if you came out and read some.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.578
Oh, um...

15:12.661 --> 15:15.039
Just, uh, give me a minute.

15:17.124 --> 15:21.211
-This was supposed to be a celebration.
-We can still figure this out.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.380
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.050
-Let me just have this one night.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.886
- It's Horse Professor!

15:28.969 --> 15:31.138
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.433
Okay. You wanted me
to read these, right? Okay.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.687
-Um, well, for Best Old Man... Terry.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.774
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Okay. Sit down, Terry. Just sit down.

15:41.857 --> 15:45.069
Sit down. If you start talking,
then we'll all be old!

15:45.152 --> 15:49.239
For Best Director...
Oh, Horse Professor.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.616
-That's me.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.910
- Speech!
-No, I-- Okay, okay, okay!

15:52.993 --> 15:54.787
Okay. Thank you.

15:54.870 --> 15:59.166
I just want to say that I've loved
being here with you this year.

15:59.249 --> 16:03.003
You've shown me the type of person
I didn't know I wanted to be.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.715
And this semester,
I got to be that person.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.467
Thank you.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.180
And I just... I want you all
to appreciate this time,

16:13.263 --> 16:16.934
and how special it is,
and how fast it'll all go away.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.813
Please, cherish this.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.441
And I have my own superlative
to announce.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.277
I, um...

16:27.361 --> 16:29.405
Oh. Uh, hmm...

16:29.488 --> 16:32.658
For the Best Actor or Actress...

16:32.741 --> 16:35.869
Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie!

16:37.538 --> 16:39.373
Okay, everyone. Enjoy your party.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.135
Hi, I just gotta tell you
how much I'm loving

16:51.218 --> 16:52.845
the small plates and lazy Susans.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.889
I put my fork down and I never know
what I'm gonna pull back up!

16:55.973 --> 16:58.100
-You've really made dinner fun again.
-Uh-huh.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.936
And did you notice my picture
on the front of the menu?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.564
Uh, sure. I mean that part
I could take or leave,

17:03.647 --> 17:06.817
but the small plates and lazy Susans
work together perfectly

17:06.900 --> 17:10.070
to form a completely new kind
of upscale dining experience.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.822
Exactly like dim sum,

17:11.905 --> 17:13.907
but with white people food,
so it's more accessible.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.953
-Oh, well, thank you.
-Huh! Tragic, isn't it?

17:18.037 --> 17:18.871
What is?

17:18.954 --> 17:21.040
I just keep thinking
about Pickles and Pogo.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.459
They've finally acknowledged
that they love each other,

17:23.542 --> 17:27.254
-but she's promised to another.
-Yes. To me.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.965
Oh, right!
So, you know better than anyone.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.884
Someone's up to something,
I can tell you that much.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.928
Mr. Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife
regularly consume bagels?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.723
Hey, why don't you two mind
your own business? How about that?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.601
As payrolled journalists,
our business is minding your business.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.228
I'm not going to help you
with your take-down piece on BoJack.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.022
-Oh, no?
-He's a good guy.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.691
And you have no idea
how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.

17:47.816 --> 17:51.111
In fact, he was with her
in the planetarium when she overdosed.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.781
-He actually gave her the heroin!
-Oh?

17:53.864 --> 17:55.741
Yeah. He told me that once
when he was drunk,

17:55.824 --> 17:58.243
and then he said,
"I've never told anybody that."

17:58.327 --> 18:01.872
Because he's modest.
So why don't you just leave him alone?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.293
Oh, Max, it's all coming together!

18:06.376 --> 18:09.046
I could just about kiss someone
if I had someone here to kiss!

18:09.129 --> 18:11.757
-Listen, I've been meaning to discuss--
-The story?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.926
It's cooking now. Smell that sizzle?

18:14.009 --> 18:16.720
We've gotta build on it.
More angles, more leads, more...

18:16.804 --> 18:18.263
-Whoa!

18:18.931 --> 18:20.933
-Oh...
-My...

18:21.350 --> 18:25.145
I-- You know, I think our story
is about as wrapped up as a mummy.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.105
What?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.357
I'd better hightail it to the office
and put ink on paper.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.776
But what about establishing
a larger pattern of behavior?

18:30.859 --> 18:33.570
We still haven't heard back
from the New Mexico girl

18:33.654 --> 18:36.156
or our contact
at the rehabilitation clinic.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.784
Don't you think we ought
to keep working together?

18:38.867 --> 18:41.912
No, I think I ought to get married.
You were right all along, Banks, my boy.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.164
The story is Sarah Lynn. It always was.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.499
-Taxi!

18:45.958 --> 18:49.670
Wait! Paige! I, uh...

18:49.920 --> 18:53.173
-I love you!
-Oh, Max. Of course you do.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.135
Everybody does. I'm Paige Sinclair!

19:04.101 --> 19:07.104
So, what happens?
When the story comes out, what do I do?

19:07.187 --> 19:11.441
A statement about how sorry you are
about certain parts of the story

19:11.525 --> 19:13.902
but other parts of the story
just aren't true.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.862
No, you--

19:14.945 --> 19:18.532
Then in everyone's head
you've apologized for the really bad stuff

19:18.615 --> 19:21.160
without legally implicating yourself.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.744
-Does that work?
-All the time.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.372
No, it doesn't.
Why are you telling him to lie?

19:25.455 --> 19:29.293
Because this is good.
This BoJack here is good.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.754
This is working, but it's so precarious.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.590
Well, I'm not gonna lose
my job here, right?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.301
The Sarah Lynn stuff,
that has nothing to do with this.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.218
-Right.
-No.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.221
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,
and the two of you are talking

19:41.305 --> 19:44.224
like you're trying to brainstorm ways
to get back on the plane.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.559
That's not gonna happen.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.896
You can try to find a parachute
or you can dive headfirst into the earth,

19:48.979 --> 19:50.898
but the plane is gone.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.193
You're seeing things in absolutes.
We can wriggle out of this.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.445
-Who's "we"?
-Diane, I'm asking you for help.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.113
This job is my lifeline.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.117
I think you should do the hard thing
and be honest.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.828
About everything. Things will get worse
before they get better,

20:04.912 --> 20:08.790
but you won't spend the rest of your life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.375
Yeah.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.045
-BoJack, just think--

20:16.465 --> 20:18.342
Wesleyan University Theater Department.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.219
<i>Paige Sinclair,</i>
<i>"Hollywoo Reporter."</i>

20:20.302 --> 20:21.470
<i>Is this a Mr. BoJack Horseman?</i>

20:21.553 --> 20:23.388
-Y-yes.
-<i>Fabulous.</i>

20:23.472 --> 20:24.932
<i>We're running a story Thursday next</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:27.559
<i>about your relationship with Sarah Lynn</i>
<i> leading up to her death.</i>

20:27.643 --> 20:29.937
<i>I wanted to give you a chance</i>
<i>to respond to these allegations.</i>

20:30.020 --> 20:32.439
<i>I presume you will deny them,</i>
<i>as is customary,</i>

20:32.522 --> 20:36.443
<i>but this is me doing my due diligence</i>
<i>and reaching out for comment, understood?</i>

20:36.526 --> 20:37.611
Uh, yeah.

20:37.694 --> 20:41.281
<i>Now, did you supply Sarah Lynn</i>
<i>with the drugs found on her person?</i>

20:41.823 --> 20:42.741
-No.

20:42.824 --> 20:46.495
<i>All right. And did you use heroin</i>
<i>with Sarah Lynn during those last weeks?</i>

20:46.954 --> 20:47.871
-No.
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:49.957
<i>Were you with her when she died?</i>

20:50.040 --> 20:51.833
Um... No.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.461
<i>And did you lie to the police</i>
<i>about any of these things?</i>

20:54.544 --> 20:55.462
No.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.174
<i>-Thank you for your time.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:00.634
What happened to being honest?

21:00.717 --> 21:03.428
I didn't think it would happen so fast.
Did she say next Thursday?

21:03.512 --> 21:06.223
That gives us a week to plan.
We can minimize damage.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.141
"We" are not doing anything.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.560
-Diane, please.
-I can't be a part of this.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.354
I have a book to write.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.773
Oh, my God!

21:14.856 --> 21:17.943
They're all making out out here!
Go to your dorms!

21:18.026 --> 21:19.903
You have rooms!

21:23.323 --> 21:27.452
Well, we did it.
And by "it," I mean <i>doing it.</i>

21:27.536 --> 21:29.371
Oh-ho! Fantastic.

21:29.454 --> 21:33.375
So, now we're even,
and everything can go back to normal.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.627
I can't wait. First step:
let's set a date for the wedding.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.379
Joey has a job opening on his tour

21:37.462 --> 21:40.590
that I think could be
a real opportunity for me.

21:40.674 --> 21:41.717
Oh.

21:41.800 --> 21:47.014
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight,
and I might be gone for a while.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.600
-Oh.
-Oh, Mister, I'm so confused!

21:50.684 --> 21:54.313
I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan,
just spinning in all directions.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.898
And I know I should be ready
to commit to a main course,

21:56.982 --> 21:59.151
but right now I'm just so excited

21:59.234 --> 22:01.862
about all the different small plates
out there, you know?

22:01.945 --> 22:04.906
It sounds like maybe this is a bad time
to have my face printed

22:04.990 --> 22:06.908
on the cover of your metaphorical menu.

22:06.992 --> 22:10.370
What? Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that part of it.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.331
Go on Joey's tour. Have a good time.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.292
And we'll plan the wedding...
when I get back?

22:15.375 --> 22:17.836
Sure, Pickles... when you get back.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.213
-Sounds like a good compromise.
-Yeah?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.965
Yeah. The best.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.510
Everyone gets what they want
and no one had to compromise.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.305
Oh, my God, I gotta go!

22:28.388 --> 22:30.515
-Okay, I love you!
-Hey.

22:30.599 --> 22:34.770
Thank you, for everything.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.942
-Hey! Sad Dog!

22:43.820 --> 22:46.073
-I think the party's over.
- Yeah.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.407
What do you got?

22:47.699 --> 22:50.494
"My relationship with Sarah Lynn
was complicated,

22:50.577 --> 22:53.372
as relationships between addicts
often are.

22:53.455 --> 22:57.209
However, certain aspects of the story
are inaccurate or exaggerated.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.544
This story has started
an important conversation

22:59.628 --> 23:03.173
and I look forward to continuing to work
on my own progress..."

23:04.424 --> 23:06.676
There's-- There's no way
to not sound like bullshit.

23:08.053 --> 23:08.887
Yeah, well...

23:08.970 --> 23:11.348
This place was supposed to be
a fresh start for me.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.475
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.603
But no matter how many starts I get,
there's always the same ending.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.398
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.151
-I'm still here, BoJack.
-Why?

23:23.527 --> 23:26.113
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.281
And you were my first client,

23:28.365 --> 23:32.077
and one time you were drunk
and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

23:32.160 --> 23:36.706
And you said, "I just like being in a room
with you. You make rooms good."

23:36.790 --> 23:37.624
You still do.

23:37.707 --> 23:43.046
I have loved you for 25 years,
and I never loved anyone better.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.508
That kind of love, you only get it
when you're young and stupid.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.926
I'm not gonna get it again.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.388
And when I tell my daughter the story
of the great love of my life,

23:51.471 --> 23:53.849
I want it to have a happy ending.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.768
Is it possible you letting me go
is the happy ending?

23:56.852 --> 24:00.272
I've gone with you this far.
In for a penny, in for a pound, right?

24:00.355 --> 24:01.731
Sunk cost and all that?

24:02.649 --> 24:04.651
Yeah, sunk cost.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.698
The story's coming out Thursday.

24:09.781 --> 24:14.286
I don't think that we can get around this,
or over this, or try to get under it.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.746
-Diane is right. We need to go through it.
-BoJack--

24:16.830 --> 24:18.665
I need to take responsibility.

24:18.915 --> 24:19.875
I want to.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.669
So you can tell your daughter
you helped me do the right thing.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.674
-I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.
-I'm looking forward to it.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.720
-You sure?
-I mean, no.
