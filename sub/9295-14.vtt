00:13.406 --> 00:15.508
There's an irk splinter cell
trying to smuggle weapons-Grade

00:15.576 --> 00:16.680
Uranium into the city.

00:16.748 --> 00:18.349
Just read the threat assessment.

00:18.417 --> 00:19.797
Look, i need you to shut down
all bridge and tunnel traffic

00:19.844 --> 00:21.073
Into the city.

00:22.547 --> 00:23.552
where'd he go?

00:23.553 --> 00:25.010
There's only one way
for them to get in.

00:25.077 --> 00:27.806
Across the east river.
That's right.

00:27.873 --> 00:29.811
Ctu was just hit by an emp.

00:29.879 --> 00:31.783
All of our systems are down.
It's a real mess.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.984
Where's jack?

00:33.052 --> 00:34.819
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

00:34.887 --> 00:36.087
We need to find him.

00:36.155 --> 00:38.322
You need to get ctu
back on line as soon as you can.

00:38.390 --> 00:39.489
Once you acquire
jack's position,

00:39.557 --> 00:40.658
You can direct me to him.

00:40.725 --> 00:42.662
I have a faster way
to get us back on line.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.198
They won't listen.
then you need

00:44.266 --> 00:45.200
To make them listen, chloe.

00:45.267 --> 00:46.703
Do what you have to do.

00:46.771 --> 00:49.538
Frank haynam, senior engineer
at the new york field office.

00:49.606 --> 00:51.675
I hope that you're here to help,
because we can damn well use it.

00:51.742 --> 00:53.299
You going in through
the clr processor?

00:53.300 --> 00:55.179
That's right. We're gonna
create a brand-New subnet.

00:55.247 --> 00:56.514
That'll take forever.

00:56.582 --> 00:58.349
I think
i can create a workaround.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.150
Why not tap directly
into the trunk line?

01:00.218 --> 01:02.051
What i'm suggesting
will be a lot faster.

01:02.119 --> 01:04.220
I'm here to clean up your mess.
You need to leave.

01:04.288 --> 01:05.486
You get out.

01:05.555 --> 01:06.922
Get out!

01:11.093 --> 01:12.794
We got power to comm.

01:12.861 --> 01:13.995
Load the rods into the zodiac.

01:14.063 --> 01:15.295
<i>It'll be short work</i>

01:15.363 --> 01:18.098
<i>Once we get the rods
across the river.</i>

01:18.165 --> 01:19.564
a vehicle is coming.

01:19.631 --> 01:21.298
<i>wait until the suv's in range,</i>

01:21.366 --> 01:22.866
<i>Then take them out.</i>

01:23.701 --> 01:25.034
Get down! Now!

01:28.738 --> 01:31.240
I've got two men
leaving the doc in a boat.

01:31.307 --> 01:33.141
They're carrying a box
the right size and shape

01:33.209 --> 01:34.209
For the rods, jack.

01:42.718 --> 01:44.585
Jack, i got through to ctu.

01:44.653 --> 01:45.920
They just got back on line.

01:45.988 --> 01:47.188
Nypd's sending choppers.

01:47.255 --> 01:48.456
We still got a real good shot
of finding them.

01:48.523 --> 01:50.124
oh, god.

01:50.192 --> 01:52.593
I know you're involved
with that robbery, miss walsh.

01:52.661 --> 01:54.761
What?

01:54.829 --> 01:56.062
<i>You are out of your mind.</i>

01:56.130 --> 01:58.597
I'm not leaving here
until i know the truth.

02:05.773 --> 02:07.073
Ctu is back on line.

02:07.141 --> 02:08.274
I know.

02:08.342 --> 02:10.609
Their helicopter's
searching the river.

02:10.675 --> 02:11.943
They're getting close.

02:12.011 --> 02:13.778
We're going to need your help
getting clear.

02:13.846 --> 02:15.410
I will get you
out of there.

02:15.478 --> 02:18.478
Stand by. I'll call you
in a few minutes.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.785
You have grade iii
level bruising.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.454
Are you sure you don't
want any painkillers?

02:34.521 --> 02:35.722
They're wrapped tight.
They'll be fine.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.990
I can't know
if the ribs

02:37.058 --> 02:38.191
Are broken without an x-Ray.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.493
You should see a doctor.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.628
Any more stress could cause
the lung to collapse.

02:41.696 --> 02:43.263
Trust me,
they're not broken. Thanks.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.565
Renee: are you sure
you're okay?

02:45.632 --> 02:47.099
Fine.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.135
Where are we at
with the fuel rods?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.603
We found the zodiac
partly submerged

02:50.670 --> 02:52.337
In the river
near 11th street, empty.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.439
The rods are
in manhattan, jack.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.841
It's not over yet.

02:55.908 --> 02:57.308
Ctu doesn't think we're more
than a few minutes behind.

02:57.376 --> 02:58.476
Who's running the ground op? Cole?
Yeah.

02:58.544 --> 03:00.478
Okay, i want you
to contact chloe.

03:00.545 --> 03:02.312
Get her to download archival
photos from 11th and the river.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.314
Have her date 'em
back 15 minutes.

03:04.382 --> 03:06.249
Fire it up. I want you ready
to go as soon as

03:06.317 --> 03:08.251
We've got a target.

03:14.658 --> 03:17.792
Sir, just spoke to a witness
who said he saw four men

03:17.860 --> 03:19.993
Unloading the contents of a
metal crate into a yellow cab.

03:20.061 --> 03:21.161
He didn't get a plate.

03:21.229 --> 03:22.529
Chloe, can we roll back
satellite?

03:22.596 --> 03:24.297
We can now. Nsa
just rerouted them.

03:24.365 --> 03:26.132
I'm logging onto
their server now.

03:28.701 --> 03:31.636
This is from
one minute ago.

03:31.704 --> 03:36.039
I'm rolling back in
30 second increments.

03:37.274 --> 03:38.373
This is from six
minutes ago.

03:38.441 --> 03:39.674
Find them
in real time, chloe.

03:39.742 --> 03:41.776
Arlo, alert nypd. Dana?

03:41.844 --> 03:43.144
Right here, sir.
Contact hazmat

03:43.211 --> 03:44.512
And nest teams,
get them mobilized.

03:44.579 --> 03:46.880
Right on that.

03:46.948 --> 03:47.981
Almost there, sir.

03:48.049 --> 03:49.349
okay, i'm live.

03:49.416 --> 03:52.150
Suspects are proceeding
west on 14th street.

03:52.218 --> 03:53.518
Cole did you get that?

03:53.586 --> 03:54.986
Yes, sir.
On the move.

03:57.089 --> 04:00.624
they've located you
on satellite.

04:00.692 --> 04:01.992
How far away are they?

04:02.060 --> 04:03.493
Not very. Hold on.

04:03.561 --> 04:05.294
Arlo: nypd confirms
they have units on the way.

04:05.362 --> 04:06.862
Hastings: how far out?
Ten blocks

04:06.930 --> 04:09.664
Coming from the north.
Head to the south.

04:09.732 --> 04:11.666
Turn left.

04:17.473 --> 04:18.606
Suspect just turned
south on seventh.

04:18.673 --> 04:20.173
Got it.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.612
I hear sirens.
Hurry up.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.146
Just a second.

04:28.214 --> 04:30.081
I'm inserting
the machine code now.

04:30.148 --> 04:31.348
Just get ready.

04:31.415 --> 04:35.918
Satellite will be disabled
for 30 seconds.

04:35.986 --> 04:37.320
On my mark.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.025
Go.

04:45.093 --> 04:46.192
What happened?

04:46.260 --> 04:47.393
The trunk line just went out.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.861
Get it back!

04:48.929 --> 04:50.569
Cole, we just lost picture.
Last known location--

04:50.570 --> 04:52.430
Seventh and waverly.
Copy that.

05:01.304 --> 05:02.370
Where are you now?

05:02.438 --> 05:04.438
On the hudson,
heading uptown again.

05:04.506 --> 05:05.940
You'll run into ninth avenue.

05:06.007 --> 05:08.875
You'll be able to blend
into cab traffic there.

05:19.817 --> 05:20.650
Back up.

05:20.718 --> 05:22.385
Cab's gone.

05:22.453 --> 05:24.654
Find it!
Scanning.

05:24.722 --> 05:25.889
Arlo, help me
widen the grid.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.490
You take west of seventh,
i'll take east.

05:27.558 --> 05:28.657
Widening it now.

05:28.725 --> 05:30.192
anything?

05:30.260 --> 05:31.226
Not yet.

05:31.294 --> 05:32.493
You, chloe?

05:32.561 --> 05:34.195
No. We were out for 30 seconds.
They could be anywhere.

05:34.262 --> 05:35.963
Cole, we're back up,
but we lost them.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.798
I'll have nypd cordon off
the area.

05:37.865 --> 05:39.032
You have them check

05:39.100 --> 05:40.800
Every garage, warehouse,
loading dock.

05:40.868 --> 05:42.035
They must have pulled in
somewhere.

05:42.103 --> 05:43.203
Yes, sir.

05:43.270 --> 05:45.271
Get me the president.

05:46.707 --> 05:47.807
Are we clear?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.041
Yes.

05:49.109 --> 05:50.809
Good. We're moving
the weapon into place

05:50.877 --> 05:52.911
As soon as it
is assembled.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.813
I need you to send me nypd
patrol patterns and checkpoints.

05:55.881 --> 05:57.114
As soon as it's safe.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.281
That's not good enough.

05:58.349 --> 05:59.749
I need them now.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.784
My instructions
were to help you,

06:01.852 --> 06:04.385
Not jeopardize my cover.

06:04.453 --> 06:06.720
I will call you back
when i can.

06:08.356 --> 06:10.957
Madam president,
i'm afraid i have bad news.

06:11.025 --> 06:13.627
Despite our best efforts,

06:13.694 --> 06:16.162
The terrorists have gotten
the nuclear rods into manhattan.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.096
How good
is your intelligence?

06:18.164 --> 06:19.360
Are you sure?

06:19.428 --> 06:20.527
We are, sir.

06:20.594 --> 06:21.993
In fact we had a visual
on the suspects

06:22.061 --> 06:23.161
Until a few moments ago.

06:23.228 --> 06:24.262
What happened?

06:24.329 --> 06:25.630
We lost them.

06:25.697 --> 06:28.133
We're launching a
multiagency search

06:28.201 --> 06:29.969
In the area we
think they're in.

06:30.037 --> 06:31.638
<i>That you think they're in?</i>

06:31.705 --> 06:34.473
Will you be able
to find them, or not?

06:34.540 --> 06:36.274
We're doing everything
in our power, mr. Kanin,

06:36.341 --> 06:38.608
But right now i don't
have an answer for you.

06:40.777 --> 06:44.046
Madam president, i'm sorry
to have to tell you this...

06:45.681 --> 06:48.782
I can no longer guarantee
the safety of manhattan.

06:48.850 --> 06:51.885
How the hell
could this happen?!

06:51.953 --> 06:54.820
Ctu had one priority: to make
sure this didn't happen!

06:54.888 --> 06:56.155
It's unacceptable!

06:56.222 --> 06:58.690
Mr. Hastings, i want you
to consider the entire resources

06:58.758 --> 07:00.258
Of the government
at your disposal.

07:00.326 --> 07:03.094
Whatever help you need,
we must find those rods.

07:03.162 --> 07:04.929
I understand, madam president.

07:04.997 --> 07:06.964
We also need to
prepare for the worst.

07:07.032 --> 07:09.199
I want all branches of
local law enforcement ready

07:09.266 --> 07:12.067
To respond to an imminent
radiological attack.

07:12.134 --> 07:14.301
Yes, ma'am.

07:14.369 --> 07:16.803
Ethan, set up a situation room

07:16.871 --> 07:19.036
And assemble
the national security team.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.806
Has president hassan

07:24.874 --> 07:26.640
Been evacuated from the un yet?

07:26.708 --> 07:28.108
He will be shortly,
but as of right now,

07:28.176 --> 07:29.342
He's still at the un.

07:32.079 --> 07:34.180
Get me jack bauer.

07:36.984 --> 07:39.285
Yeah, but how long
was the satellite was down?

07:39.353 --> 07:40.486
What, 30 seconds?

07:40.554 --> 07:41.986
Yeah. I know what
you're thinking, jack.

07:42.054 --> 07:45.021
Odd we lost the feed just as we
were closing in on the target.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.056
Who was running point at ctu?

07:47.124 --> 07:48.992
Chloe o'brian.
You know her from before, right?

07:49.059 --> 07:50.593
yes.
And you trust her?

07:50.661 --> 07:51.861
With my life.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.129
Mr. Bauer, i have
president taylor for you.

07:54.197 --> 07:56.064
Cole, i've got to call you back.

07:56.131 --> 07:57.798
I got the white house
on the line.

07:57.866 --> 07:58.965
Hello?

07:59.033 --> 08:00.966
Jack, it's president taylor.

08:01.034 --> 08:02.633
I'm calling to ask you a favor.

08:02.701 --> 08:03.900
Anything, ma'am.

08:03.968 --> 08:05.802
President hassan and his family
are being evacuated

08:05.870 --> 08:08.204
From the un and brought here,
and i would like

08:08.272 --> 08:10.006
For you to supervise
that operation.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.207
With all due respect,
madam president,

08:11.275 --> 08:13.175
I think i'd be much more helpful
staying in place

08:13.243 --> 08:14.677
Here with
ctu. Besides,

08:14.745 --> 08:16.511
Secret service
is more than capable.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.848
Well, that may be true,
but i'd feel a lot better

08:18.916 --> 08:20.150
Knowing you were on the job.

08:20.218 --> 08:22.752
Jack, in light
of the threat to new york,

08:22.820 --> 08:23.986
President hassan's role

08:24.054 --> 08:27.055
In securing a lasting peace
is more crucial than ever.

08:27.123 --> 08:28.690
I need him safe.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.858
I understand, ma'am.

08:29.925 --> 08:31.159
I'll leave
for the un immediately.

08:31.227 --> 08:32.427
Thank you, jack.

08:32.494 --> 08:34.260
I'll see you when you get here.

08:34.328 --> 08:35.462
Yes, ma'am.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.431
She wants me
to supervise hassan's evac

08:37.499 --> 08:38.999
To mcguire air force base.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.267
All right, let's go.

08:40.335 --> 08:41.735
Renee.

08:41.803 --> 08:44.371
Renee, i need to do this
on my own.

08:44.439 --> 08:45.939
We're not going
through this again.

08:46.007 --> 08:48.408
I'm coming with you,
end of discussion.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.371
Do you have the rods?

09:31.439 --> 09:32.739
In the trunk.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.207
Where is ali?

09:34.275 --> 09:36.509
He didn't make it.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.777
I'm sorry.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.579
Tarin will take his place
as driver.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.414
How long before
the device is functional?

09:43.481 --> 09:45.782
All we have to do
is load in the fuel rods.

09:47.284 --> 09:48.984
Tarin.

09:51.821 --> 09:53.587
Get ready to leave.

09:53.654 --> 09:55.087
I want to place the bomb

09:55.155 --> 09:57.022
As soon after i talk
to the president as possible.

10:28.641 --> 10:30.575
agent o'connor.

10:30.643 --> 10:32.110
Jack bauer.
I know who you are, sir.

10:32.177 --> 10:33.778
I've been briefed
by command at mcguire.

10:33.846 --> 10:34.946
Ms. Walker.

10:35.014 --> 10:36.247
Agent o'connor.

10:36.315 --> 10:37.549
We're cleared
for a subterranean evacuation.

10:37.617 --> 10:38.917
The feeling is
that president hassan

10:38.985 --> 10:40.552
Will be safer
underground in the event

10:40.620 --> 10:42.620
Of a radiological attack.
Agreed.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.055
How many agents?
There are seven secret service,

10:44.123 --> 10:45.956
Including myself, two of
hassan's internal security,

10:46.024 --> 10:47.591
And now you and ms. Walker.

10:47.659 --> 10:49.159
What's the time frame?
Ten minutes.

10:49.226 --> 10:50.993
There's a service tunnel
that runs parallel

10:51.061 --> 10:52.561
To the path lines
leading into new jersey.

10:52.629 --> 10:54.129
We're just waiting
on the vehicles now.

10:54.197 --> 10:56.231
I'd like to see the exact route.
Of course.

10:56.299 --> 10:57.599
I have the maps
and evac protocols

10:57.667 --> 10:58.867
In the conference room,

10:58.934 --> 11:00.468
But president hassan is asking
to see you first.

11:00.536 --> 11:01.669
He's in the council chamber.

11:01.737 --> 11:03.671
Fine. You two get started.

11:03.739 --> 11:05.906
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

11:13.647 --> 11:15.113
Sir.

11:17.516 --> 11:18.883
Mr. Bauer.

11:18.951 --> 11:20.785
President taylor
wanted me to supervise

11:20.852 --> 11:22.119
The evacuation
of you and your family

11:22.187 --> 11:23.453
To mcguire air force base.

11:23.521 --> 11:24.788
So i'm told.

11:24.856 --> 11:25.990
And i'm glad for it.

11:26.058 --> 11:27.225
How long will it take for you

11:27.292 --> 11:29.327
And your family to be ready?
We're ready now.

11:29.394 --> 11:31.161
My wife and daughter
are in the residence

11:31.229 --> 11:32.496
Awaiting your instructions.

11:32.564 --> 11:33.764
Give us ten minutes

11:33.832 --> 11:35.132
And then we'll evacuate you
and your family

11:35.199 --> 11:36.366
Through a service tunnel
under the building

11:36.434 --> 11:38.135
And straight on to new jersey.

11:40.037 --> 11:42.439
And here i thought i would be
leaving the united nations today

11:42.507 --> 11:45.909
At the head of a peace march
down fifth avenue.

11:45.977 --> 11:48.845
My president still thinks
that might happen, sir.

11:50.381 --> 11:52.282
I hope she's right, mr. Bauer.

11:52.350 --> 11:54.718
Me, too, mr. President.

11:54.786 --> 11:56.155
Give us ten minutes.

12:03.597 --> 12:07.331
We need to talk about
a response, madam president.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.132
I've prepared three

12:09.200 --> 12:10.633
Retaliatory
strike scenarios

12:10.701 --> 12:12.834
Against targets inside the irk.

12:12.901 --> 12:14.202
do i need to remind you,

12:14.270 --> 12:16.039
General brucker,
the islamic republic

12:16.107 --> 12:17.608
Is an ally?

12:17.675 --> 12:19.774
You don't.
But what good is an ally

12:19.842 --> 12:21.108
If its citizens can

12:21.175 --> 12:22.876
Attack us
on their own?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.210
Madam president,

12:24.278 --> 12:25.977
A call's come into
the white house switchboard

12:26.045 --> 12:28.007
From a man claiming to be in
possession of the nuclear rods.

12:28.075 --> 12:29.908
He wants
to talk to you.

12:29.976 --> 12:32.511
Do we believe
he's who he says he is?

12:32.579 --> 12:33.745
Confidence is high, ma'am.

12:33.813 --> 12:35.245
He's offered details

12:35.313 --> 12:37.313
Of recent events that no civilian
could know, plus he's

12:37.381 --> 12:38.981
On an anonymous icc
channel that's scrambled

12:39.048 --> 12:40.248
And impossible to trace.

12:40.316 --> 12:42.216
Put him on speaker.

12:48.322 --> 12:50.222
This is president taylor.

12:50.290 --> 12:51.923
Good morning,
madam president.

12:51.991 --> 12:54.192
This is going to be
a short conversation.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.161
Who are you
and what do you want?

12:56.229 --> 12:58.364
You know i have
the fuel rods.

12:58.431 --> 13:00.766
You know i got them
into manhattan.

13:00.834 --> 13:03.035
What i want now
is to convince you

13:03.103 --> 13:06.905
That i have no desire to
harm innocent americans.

13:06.973 --> 13:09.374
And yet you're
threatening them with a bomb.

13:09.442 --> 13:11.743
Actually, a radiological
dispersal device,

13:11.811 --> 13:14.279
Madam president,
capable of contaminating

13:14.347 --> 13:15.747
40 square blocks under
a dense radiation cloud.

13:15.815 --> 13:18.549
Any attack
on the united states

13:18.617 --> 13:20.885
Will prompt a retaliation
against your country.

13:20.952 --> 13:23.620
I would expect
nothing less.

13:23.688 --> 13:25.421
But you should
listen to me.

13:25.489 --> 13:29.392
What i'm asking
for is simple.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.061
Turn over
president hassan.

13:31.128 --> 13:34.198
What?

13:34.266 --> 13:36.034
He's a traitor to his people
and must stand trial

13:36.102 --> 13:38.036
For his crimes.

13:38.104 --> 13:40.038
That will never happen.

13:40.106 --> 13:44.176
You have exactly one hour
to change your mind.

13:44.244 --> 13:46.078
Mr. Woods knows
how to contact me.

13:46.146 --> 13:48.881
Madam president...

13:48.949 --> 13:51.150
The clock starts now.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.221
40 squares blocks--
How many people is that?

13:55.289 --> 13:58.758
Between a 100,000 and 150,000.

13:58.826 --> 14:00.627
Rob, inform

14:00.694 --> 14:03.329
Ctu of the threat,
but the ransom demand

14:03.397 --> 14:05.264
Stays in this room.

14:05.332 --> 14:06.997
Tim, call up
the new york guard

14:07.065 --> 14:08.732
To support first
responders,

14:08.800 --> 14:11.634
And have the military
police execute

14:11.702 --> 14:13.769
An evacuation plan.
Yes, ma'am.

14:13.836 --> 14:15.970
Madam president?
What is it, rob?

14:17.305 --> 14:18.805
Well, i'm just going to say it.

14:18.873 --> 14:20.473
We should consider
the alternative.

14:20.541 --> 14:22.308
What alternative?

14:22.376 --> 14:24.076
We have an out here.

14:24.144 --> 14:25.677
I think we should take it.
You mean, give in

14:25.745 --> 14:27.479
He demand to turn over

14:27.547 --> 14:29.047
President hassan?
No one man

14:29.115 --> 14:30.615
Is worth the lives
of tens of thousands.

14:30.683 --> 14:32.049
And you know what? I bet

14:32.117 --> 14:33.392
He would agree.
Madam president,

14:33.393 --> 14:35.106
are we really having
This conversation?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.787
Doesn't it
Deserve a conversation?

14:36.855 --> 14:38.921
Not unless you're intent
on destroying

14:38.989 --> 14:40.423
Our moral authority.

14:40.490 --> 14:43.159
This country's unique place
among nations, maybe forever.

14:43.226 --> 14:45.528
As opposed to what?
The irradiation

14:45.596 --> 14:47.296
Of all those people?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.032
Real businesses,
real homes

14:49.100 --> 14:51.335
Uninhabitable
for a hundred years or more?

14:58.243 --> 14:59.644
Madam president,

14:59.712 --> 15:01.780
I agree.

15:01.848 --> 15:03.148
Giving up hassan is wrong,

15:03.216 --> 15:05.317
But a 40-Block wasteland
at the heart of new york city

15:05.385 --> 15:06.919
Is unthinkable.

15:06.987 --> 15:08.436
This country would
never be the same.

15:08.437 --> 15:10.690
The country would Crucify us
if word ever got out

15:10.758 --> 15:12.025
That this could
have been avoided.

15:12.093 --> 15:13.493
Now we're talking politics,
for god's sake?

15:13.561 --> 15:15.896
We're talking about the primary
role of government--

15:15.963 --> 15:18.031
Any government-- Which is

15:18.099 --> 15:20.868
To protect its citizens.
It could also escalate,

15:20.936 --> 15:22.169
Madam president.

15:22.237 --> 15:23.637
They attack us,

15:23.705 --> 15:25.740
We attack them back.

15:25.807 --> 15:28.042
The entire region could be
drawn into the conflict

15:28.110 --> 15:29.911
And destabilized.
Excuse me, general,

15:29.979 --> 15:31.546
But weren't you the one
just advocating

15:31.614 --> 15:33.382
For a retaliatory strike?

15:33.449 --> 15:34.750
Well, in the military,

15:34.817 --> 15:37.019
We like to talk about facts
on the ground.

15:37.087 --> 15:39.689
Well, they have changed,
madam president.

15:39.756 --> 15:42.425
Now, we have
a viable option.

15:42.493 --> 15:45.028
Viable?

15:45.096 --> 15:47.597
Is that the sense
in the room then?

15:47.665 --> 15:49.399
That surrendering

15:49.466 --> 15:51.767
President hassan
is somehow viable?

15:51.835 --> 15:53.835
In the first place,

15:53.903 --> 15:57.071
The people who are offering us
this deal cannot be trusted.

15:57.138 --> 15:59.172
How do we know they won't
detonate the bomb anyway?

15:59.240 --> 16:01.074
Secondly, president hassan

16:01.142 --> 16:03.410
Is a guest of this country.

16:03.477 --> 16:06.113
He is my partner in peace.

16:06.181 --> 16:07.715
And i will not sell him out

16:07.783 --> 16:09.951
To the very terrorists
that we are determined

16:10.019 --> 16:12.520
To defeat.
And finally,

16:12.588 --> 16:15.757
Caving to any terrorist demand

16:15.824 --> 16:18.160
Weakens this nation
immeasurably.

16:19.163 --> 16:20.797
Now, we have 60 minutes

16:20.865 --> 16:22.898
To find these
bastards.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.565
And i believe we will.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.305
But if we don't,
and the worst happens,

16:27.373 --> 16:29.307
We will deal with it.

16:29.374 --> 16:32.910
We will pick ourselves up off
the floor and deal with it.

16:32.978 --> 16:35.947
Why? Because that's what
we do.

16:36.014 --> 16:38.316
Americans don't stay down.

16:38.384 --> 16:41.519
We rise up together
in times of crisis.

16:41.587 --> 16:43.421
We carry on.

16:43.488 --> 16:45.823
Is that clear?

16:55.032 --> 16:56.232
Start the calls, tim.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.800
Yes, ma'am.

17:12.784 --> 17:14.884
Chloe, i need
an updated list

17:14.952 --> 17:16.452
Of road closures
and checkpoints.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.854
I thought arlo was
interfacing with nypd.

17:18.922 --> 17:20.923
He is, but national guard
units are on their way,

17:20.990 --> 17:22.357
So are teams
from fbi new jersey.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.492
I want to know where the holes
are, so i can plug them.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.493
I'll forward it
to your screen now.

17:26.561 --> 17:28.729
Thank you.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.835
yes?

17:36.903 --> 17:38.002
It's me.

17:38.070 --> 17:39.871
Do you have the roadblock
information?

17:39.938 --> 17:41.704
I'll have it for you
in five minutes.

17:41.772 --> 17:43.671
Did you speak
to president taylor?

17:43.739 --> 17:45.206
I did.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.508
Her response
was as i anticipated.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.144
But as the time pressure builds,
she'll change her mind

17:51.212 --> 17:53.246
And give up hassan.
I'm certain of it.

17:53.314 --> 17:54.480
What if she doesn't?

17:54.548 --> 17:56.982
Then we'll strike
a hard blow against the city.

17:57.050 --> 18:00.252
Either way,
the peace process dies.

18:08.428 --> 18:09.728
It's ready.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.968
I don't have time to deal
with these anymore.

18:17.036 --> 18:18.203
Mr. Weiss?

18:18.271 --> 18:19.571
Can i have a word?

18:19.638 --> 18:22.273
Certainly.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.508
I thought
secretary kanin's

18:24.576 --> 18:25.943
Point was a good one.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.878
If we simply turn
hassan over,

18:27.945 --> 18:30.479
We risk damaging the good
name of the united states.

18:30.547 --> 18:32.581
What are you suggesting?

18:32.649 --> 18:34.916
Uh, a third way.

18:34.984 --> 18:38.419
A covert action
in which we

18:38.487 --> 18:40.120
Deliver hassan
to the terrorists,

18:40.188 --> 18:42.355
But make it look like
they took him hostage.

18:44.091 --> 18:46.225
Two birds, mr. Weiss.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.060
We spare new york

18:48.127 --> 18:49.728
And we preserve our reputation

18:49.795 --> 18:51.462
In the eyes
of the world.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.732
I admit, i'm intrigued.

18:54.799 --> 18:55.866
But...?

18:55.934 --> 18:57.934
It'll never fly.

18:58.002 --> 18:59.736
You heard the president.
She won't go for it.

18:59.803 --> 19:01.570
Not in a million years.
No, of course, she won't.

19:01.638 --> 19:03.605
The question is,

19:03.673 --> 19:05.239
Will you?

19:09.242 --> 19:11.343
I'm asking

19:11.410 --> 19:13.845
For your cooperation, mr. Weiss.

19:13.912 --> 19:15.813
For the good of the country.

19:17.414 --> 19:21.716
Well, even if i agreed to help,
it's too late.

19:21.784 --> 19:23.384
Hassan's already
on his way here.

19:23.452 --> 19:25.352
No, it's not. A wet ops
team was mobilized

19:25.420 --> 19:27.921
In the event of a strike
against the irk.

19:27.988 --> 19:31.323
If you get me hassan's exact
route, i can redirect them

19:31.391 --> 19:33.090
To intercept
his security detail.

19:33.158 --> 19:35.059
I don't have access
to that information.

19:35.126 --> 19:36.226
It's being handled through

19:36.294 --> 19:37.360
The secretary
of state's office.

19:37.428 --> 19:38.894
Then we just have to get it
from mr. Kanin.

19:40.663 --> 19:43.063
It's sedition, general brucker.

19:45.599 --> 19:48.333
Are you familiar with the fourth
nuremberg principle?

19:48.401 --> 19:50.635
If the orders
of the president

19:50.702 --> 19:52.070
Are illegal,
it is our

19:52.138 --> 19:54.338
Moral obligation
to disobey them.

19:54.406 --> 19:56.373
And you think they are? Illegal?

19:56.441 --> 19:58.141
The president
is letting her idealism

19:58.208 --> 19:59.708
Get in the way
of her responsibilities

19:59.776 --> 20:02.043
As commander in chief.
It's hardly the same thing.

20:02.111 --> 20:03.578
You don't think so?

20:03.646 --> 20:06.413
With the fate of
an american city in the balance?

20:06.481 --> 20:08.716
"The primary role
of government is to protect

20:08.783 --> 20:11.752
Its citizens."
Your words, mr. Weiss.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.656
It's time to decide
whether or not you meant them.

20:58.868 --> 21:02.171
The white house just received
credible intelligence

21:02.238 --> 21:04.240
That the terrorists
we've been tracking

21:04.308 --> 21:07.243
Plan to detonate
a radiological device

21:07.310 --> 21:10.412
In new york city
in less than 50 minutes.

21:15.717 --> 21:17.517
all of us in this building
have friends

21:17.585 --> 21:19.820
And family who live in the city.

21:19.888 --> 21:21.154
We know we are

21:21.222 --> 21:24.523
Bound by law not to warn them.

21:24.591 --> 21:28.360
But we also know it is still
in our power to protect them.

21:28.428 --> 21:31.796
We are their
last line of defense.

21:31.864 --> 21:33.798
That is our job.

21:33.866 --> 21:35.166
That is what we will do

21:35.233 --> 21:38.302
With every second
of every minute we have left.

21:38.370 --> 21:39.870
Starting now.

21:39.938 --> 21:41.906
Go back through
all your leads.

21:41.974 --> 21:45.276
Appeal to your sources
one more time.

21:45.344 --> 21:48.446
Find that bomb.

22:05.401 --> 22:09.402
I just heard from our source
inside ctu.

22:09.470 --> 22:11.738
Based on the roadblocks,
amsterdam is closed off,

22:11.805 --> 22:14.742
But there's a potential
target area just to your left.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.410
You'll be avoiding
nypd checkpoints

22:16.478 --> 22:17.711
To the south and west.

22:17.779 --> 22:20.614
All right.

22:20.682 --> 22:22.649
Turning.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.018
Can you park
in that block?

22:25.086 --> 22:27.688
Yes.

22:27.756 --> 22:30.457
Good. The fallout radius
will include a good part

22:30.525 --> 22:32.526
Of the upper west side.

22:34.595 --> 22:36.596
I'll wait for your call.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.457
How many men
on the detail?

23:13.525 --> 23:16.792
Eleven. Hassan's own security,
secret service,

23:16.860 --> 23:19.260
And two former agents--
Jack bauer and renee walker.

23:19.328 --> 23:21.128
Why is bauer involved?

23:21.195 --> 23:22.462
The president trusts him.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.897
And believe me, he's not
someone to be taken lightly.

23:24.965 --> 23:26.598
Oh, he's up against
an elite team

23:26.666 --> 23:28.302
Who will have the advantage
of surprise.

23:28.369 --> 23:30.706
Bauer and his people
don't stand a chance.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.515
The loss of life is regrettable,
mr. Weiss.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.116
No one feels this more keenly

23:40.184 --> 23:42.218
Than a soldier
who's led men into battle.

23:42.286 --> 23:44.653
But right now,
we don't have a choice.

23:57.898 --> 23:59.499
ethan.

23:59.566 --> 24:00.766
What's going on?

24:00.834 --> 24:01.934
Oh, i'm sorry.

24:02.002 --> 24:04.136
I thought you were
with the president.

24:04.204 --> 24:06.137
I was.

24:06.205 --> 24:08.539
What are you doing in here?

24:08.607 --> 24:10.007
Oh, i asked mr. Weiss

24:10.075 --> 24:12.275
To pull up the latest
white house readiness protocols.

24:12.342 --> 24:14.109
He couldn't log on
from his computer,

24:14.177 --> 24:15.578
So we were trying from yours.

24:21.717 --> 24:24.284
I was also reviewing
president hassan's itinerary

24:24.351 --> 24:27.553
To see if we could facilitate
a military escort.

24:27.621 --> 24:29.922
Hmm.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.964
Open the door.

24:42.031 --> 24:44.467
I'm afraid
i can't do that, mr. Kanin.

24:44.535 --> 24:46.536
Then get out of my way.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.241
Rob?

24:52.308 --> 24:53.842
Ethan, listen, i...

24:53.909 --> 24:55.609
No, you listen to me.

24:58.111 --> 24:59.912
I think i have a
pretty good idea

24:59.980 --> 25:01.079
What's going on here.

25:01.147 --> 25:02.213
Sit down, mr. Kanin.

25:02.281 --> 25:03.848
There are some things
you need to know.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.050
There sure as hell are.

25:08.086 --> 25:09.353
But i'll stay where i am,

25:09.421 --> 25:10.921
If you don't mind.

25:10.989 --> 25:12.022
Ethan, do what he says.

25:12.089 --> 25:13.356
Sit down, please.

25:14.759 --> 25:16.059
this is bauer. Go ahead.

25:16.127 --> 25:19.028
I said, go ahead.

25:21.832 --> 25:22.931
Give me your phone.
General...

25:22.999 --> 25:24.866
Get your hands
off of me!

25:24.934 --> 25:26.434
wait!

25:30.104 --> 25:32.472
This is beyond madness.

25:34.207 --> 25:37.375
The two of you will spend the
rest of your lives in prison.

25:37.443 --> 25:38.376
Maybe, mr. Kanin.

25:38.444 --> 25:39.977
But my guess is that one day,

25:40.045 --> 25:42.480
The country
will thank us for it.

25:46.917 --> 25:50.786
Rob... i'm begging you.

25:50.854 --> 25:52.854
Don't do this.

25:54.856 --> 25:56.856
Don't betray your president.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.661
ethan? Ethan?

26:05.897 --> 26:07.632
All right.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.135
Ethan!

26:12.071 --> 26:13.538
My god! Ethan!

26:15.541 --> 26:17.541
Ethan!

26:18.543 --> 26:19.809
Okay.

26:19.877 --> 26:20.810
Oh!

26:20.878 --> 26:22.211
Okay.

26:22.279 --> 26:23.980
Ethan, here, here, here.

26:25.048 --> 26:26.315
Call 911.

26:26.383 --> 26:27.616
We call for help,
the first thing

26:27.684 --> 26:29.117
He does is get word
to the president.

26:29.185 --> 26:31.620
But he's having a heart attack!
We can't just do nothing!

26:31.688 --> 26:33.122
We didn't do nothing;
you gave him his medication.

26:33.190 --> 26:35.024
Well, it's not working.

26:36.293 --> 26:37.294
Look, i realize
that you two are close.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.463
But this is not
an emotional decision,

26:39.531 --> 26:42.165
This is a tactical one.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.501
We wait to acquire hassan

26:44.568 --> 26:46.169
Before calling an ambulance,
understand?

26:46.237 --> 26:48.272
What if he doesn't
make it that long?

26:48.340 --> 26:51.109
We have to pray that he does.

27:02.556 --> 27:05.124
All right?

27:05.192 --> 27:07.195
All right.

27:09.265 --> 27:11.366
Come on.

27:14.405 --> 27:16.406
We pick up the service tunnel
under third avenue.

27:16.474 --> 27:18.242
From there, the trip
to mcguire by convoy

27:18.309 --> 27:19.409
Is less than 30 minutes.

27:19.477 --> 27:20.844
Thank you, ms. Walker.

27:26.651 --> 27:28.119
Secretary kanin,
this is jack bauer.

27:28.187 --> 27:30.721
I can see on my phone
that you just tried to call me.

27:30.789 --> 27:32.523
Please call me back
as soon as you can.

27:32.591 --> 27:33.524
Thank you.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.962
This is bauer. Patch me through
to mcguire air force base.

27:40.900 --> 27:43.235
How far are you from an access
point into the tunnels?

27:47.607 --> 27:49.208
Uh, based on
what i'm looking at,

27:49.275 --> 27:50.542
Less than two miles.

27:50.610 --> 27:52.211
Well, the security detail's
already on the move.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.479
Can you get there in time?

27:53.547 --> 27:54.914
Yeah, if we haul ass.

27:54.981 --> 27:56.248
And the ambush
happens where?

27:56.316 --> 27:57.316
At the vehicle, sir.

27:57.383 --> 27:59.017
Remember, the objective
is president hassan.

27:59.085 --> 28:01.019
Do what you have to do
to take him alive.

28:01.087 --> 28:02.187
Yes, sir.

28:02.254 --> 28:04.255
Good luck.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.926
Thank you. Have him call me back
as soon as possible.

28:08.994 --> 28:10.095
renee.

28:10.163 --> 28:11.597
Yeah?

28:11.665 --> 28:13.399
Secretary kanin
tried to call me.

28:13.467 --> 28:14.667
Now he's not
answering his phone.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.135
The operator at
mcguire air force base

28:16.203 --> 28:17.369
Can't find him either.

28:17.437 --> 28:18.370
Something's not right.

28:18.438 --> 28:20.940
Keep your eyes open.

28:35.664 --> 28:37.164
Hold up.

28:39.167 --> 28:40.700
We set?
Yeah, the vehicles

28:40.768 --> 28:42.168
To transport the
hassans are 200 meters

28:42.236 --> 28:43.702
Up the tunnel.
There is a section

28:43.770 --> 28:45.004
we couldn't get by.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.043
Did you walk it?

28:51.111 --> 28:52.444
Yes, sir. All clear.

28:52.512 --> 28:54.612
Get the family.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.180
This way.

28:58.584 --> 29:00.251
Our suvs are a short hike
up the tunnel.

29:00.318 --> 29:01.619
Stay together as we
move towards them.

29:03.522 --> 29:04.522
This is bauer.

29:04.589 --> 29:07.058
Patch me through
to secretary kanin.

29:09.896 --> 29:11.196
here they come.

29:11.264 --> 29:12.964
Man 2:
is hassan with them?

29:13.032 --> 29:14.532
Yes.

29:14.599 --> 29:16.434
Masks on.

29:16.502 --> 29:18.502
Take your positions.

29:21.505 --> 29:23.473
Wait until the targets
are in the kill zone.

29:23.540 --> 29:26.475
Remember, we need
to take hassan alive.

29:37.523 --> 29:39.891
secretary kanin?

29:39.958 --> 29:41.959
Just a minute.

29:51.607 --> 29:53.508
Yes, what is it?

29:53.576 --> 29:55.977
Excuse me, sir, but jack bauer's
calling for secretary kanin.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.711
Well, the secretary
is busy with me right now.

29:57.779 --> 29:58.712
I understand
that, sir,

29:58.780 --> 29:59.980
But mr. Bauer's persisting.

30:00.047 --> 30:01.181
He says it's very important.

30:01.248 --> 30:02.515
He's holding on line one.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.016
All right, thank you.

30:04.117 --> 30:05.584
I'll take care of it.

30:19.659 --> 30:21.027
Jack, hi. It's rob weiss.

30:21.095 --> 30:23.029
sir, we're in
a service tunnel under...

30:23.097 --> 30:24.630
I'm sorry,
you're breaking up, jack.

30:24.698 --> 30:25.898
Can't hear you.

30:25.966 --> 30:28.767
I said, we're in
a service tunnel under the un.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.201
We're evacuating president
hassan and his family.

30:30.269 --> 30:31.902
Is everything all right?
You tell me.

30:31.970 --> 30:33.570
Secretary kanin tried
to get ahold of me

30:33.638 --> 30:35.238
About ten minutes ago
on his private cell.

30:35.306 --> 30:37.340
I've been trying him ever
since; he won't pick up.

30:37.407 --> 30:38.440
Well, the secretary's tied up

30:38.508 --> 30:39.842
With the joint chiefs
right now, jack.

30:39.909 --> 30:42.377
Do you know what he wanted
to talk to me about?

30:42.445 --> 30:43.378
Honestly couldn't say.

30:43.446 --> 30:44.513
I could've been anything.

30:44.581 --> 30:45.781
I don't think so.

30:45.849 --> 30:47.116
He knows we're conducting
a sensitive evac.

30:47.184 --> 30:48.552
He called me during it.

30:48.620 --> 30:49.854
There's got to be
some kind of a connection.

30:49.922 --> 30:51.890
Well, i'll make sure
he gets the message.

30:51.958 --> 30:52.891
Mr. Weiss,

30:52.958 --> 30:53.925
I don't think you understand.

30:53.993 --> 30:55.898
I need to talk
to secretary kanin now.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.566
That's not possible.

30:57.634 --> 30:58.968
What do you mean,
it's not possible?

30:59.035 --> 31:00.135
We're dealing
with an imminent

31:00.203 --> 31:01.370
Terrorist attack
on our soil!

31:01.437 --> 31:03.205
Just do your job
and let us do ours!

31:03.272 --> 31:05.373
all due respect, sir,
i am doing my j...

31:05.441 --> 31:06.808
Hello? Hello?

31:06.875 --> 31:08.576
Son of a bitch
just hung up on me.

31:08.644 --> 31:10.346
He's under a lot of
stress; they all are.

31:10.413 --> 31:12.583
I don't give a...
agent o'connor, stop.

31:14.619 --> 31:16.787
Start walking
them back now.

31:16.854 --> 31:18.155
Something's not right.

31:18.222 --> 31:20.090
We're gonna head back
to the un, reassess there.

31:20.158 --> 31:21.158
Let's go.

31:23.195 --> 31:25.196
President hassan,
i'm very sorry,

31:25.264 --> 31:27.165
But you're too exposed
down here.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.667
Whatever you think
is right, mr. Bauer.

31:28.734 --> 31:30.235
They're turning around.

31:30.303 --> 31:32.404
How far are they?

31:32.471 --> 31:33.471
About a hundred yards.

31:35.507 --> 31:37.675
Okay, take out
as many as you can.

31:54.093 --> 31:55.093
Renee!

31:55.161 --> 31:56.494
I need you to get
president hassan

31:56.562 --> 31:59.864
And his family to the side
tunnel and back to the un!

31:59.932 --> 32:01.165
What about you?!

32:01.233 --> 32:02.299
I'll be right behind you!

32:02.367 --> 32:03.300
President hassan,

32:03.368 --> 32:05.670
You need to go.
Now. Now!

32:12.345 --> 32:13.612
Okay, go.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.680
Go, go.

32:30.397 --> 32:32.131
Go! Go!

32:45.879 --> 32:47.380
Your orders are to
stay with president hassan.

32:47.447 --> 32:50.082
You need to go.

32:50.150 --> 32:51.684
I know what
i have to do, sir.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.321
Good luck.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.056
Thank you, sir.

32:56.124 --> 32:58.192
You ready?

32:58.260 --> 32:59.260
I'm ready.

32:59.327 --> 33:01.328
Now!

33:17.083 --> 33:19.485
See if you can get wide
and outflank them.

33:19.552 --> 33:21.086
I'm going to try to draw them
into a crossfire.

33:21.154 --> 33:23.321
Shoot only on my command.

33:25.491 --> 33:28.292
Engage.

33:58.456 --> 34:00.256
Mr. President, we
need to keep moving.

34:00.324 --> 34:01.758
Your people are being
slaughtered, mr. Bauer.

34:01.826 --> 34:02.926
We need to help them.

34:02.993 --> 34:04.194
They're buying us
the time we need.

34:04.261 --> 34:05.361
Don't let it
be in vain.

34:05.429 --> 34:06.597
We need to go now!

34:43.158 --> 34:44.811
Give me a weapon. No.

34:44.812 --> 34:45.812
I've been a soldier,
mr. Bauer.

34:45.879 --> 34:47.480
I can handle a gun.
I'll fight with you.

34:47.547 --> 34:49.248
Mr. President, my job
is to protect you.

34:49.315 --> 34:52.018
You need to do what
i say. Now, go!

34:55.021 --> 34:57.121
We to keep moving.
Come on.

34:57.190 --> 34:58.791
come on. We got to go.

35:04.164 --> 35:06.766
Renee, we're not
going to make it.

35:06.834 --> 35:07.968
Take cover.

35:08.036 --> 35:09.770
Go! Go!

35:19.819 --> 35:21.188
I'm going to head up the middle.

35:21.256 --> 35:23.527
As soon as i set these off,
i want you to start firing.

35:23.594 --> 35:24.762
Doesn't matter if
you hit anything.

35:24.830 --> 35:27.033
Just make some noise.
Mr. President?

35:29.739 --> 35:30.840
You take care
of your family.

35:30.908 --> 35:32.878
You ready?
Yeah.

35:33.915 --> 35:35.250
Let's go.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.529
Mathis! Donner! Go!

36:05.597 --> 36:08.533
Move! Move!

36:14.407 --> 36:15.873
Move! Move! Move!

36:42.266 --> 36:44.534
I'm going to take
the high ground.

36:44.601 --> 36:46.604
In about five seconds,
start giving me cover fire.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.840
Okay?

37:23.444 --> 37:24.444
Take the weapon off.

37:24.512 --> 37:26.479
Take the weapon off now!

37:26.547 --> 37:28.548
Now!

37:37.591 --> 37:39.860
Who are you?

37:41.664 --> 37:43.198
You're making
a huge mistake.

37:45.267 --> 37:47.368
You're american.

37:47.435 --> 37:49.069
Why did you attack us?

37:49.137 --> 37:51.338
Because a dirty bomb will
be detonated in new york

37:51.406 --> 37:53.741
Unless we deliver hassan
to the terrorists.

37:53.809 --> 37:55.310
What are you
talking about?

37:55.378 --> 37:57.545
A ransom demand has been made.

37:57.613 --> 38:00.782
Him for the bomb
by 06:15 hours.

38:03.919 --> 38:06.221
Jack, that's less
than 20 minutes.

38:07.523 --> 38:08.556
Does the president
know about this?

38:08.624 --> 38:10.625
She's refusing to deal
with the terrorists.

38:10.692 --> 38:12.060
This is
general brucker's operation.

38:12.127 --> 38:14.162
Get up. Get up!

38:14.230 --> 38:15.330
What are you doing?

38:15.397 --> 38:17.398
I'm going to get you
up to the street level,

38:17.466 --> 38:18.700
Where i can make
a phone call.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.869
There's no time for that.
This is on you now.

38:20.936 --> 38:23.571
You have to deliver
hassan to the terrorists.

38:23.639 --> 38:25.072
I don't take orders
from anybody

38:25.140 --> 38:26.907
But the president of the
united states. Now, move.

38:47.687 --> 38:50.222
keep moving.

39:03.767 --> 39:05.366
Yes?

39:05.434 --> 39:08.136
Why haven't i heard from you?

39:08.203 --> 39:09.570
Because i don't know anything.

39:09.638 --> 39:10.838
What does that mean?

39:10.906 --> 39:13.206
Are the americans
handing over hassan, or not?

39:13.274 --> 39:14.574
The only information we have

39:14.642 --> 39:16.642
Is that he's being transported
to mcguire air force base.

39:16.710 --> 39:18.710
We lost communication
with his security detail

39:18.778 --> 39:20.345
About 20 minutes ago.

39:22.147 --> 39:25.716
So president taylor
doesn't intend to give him up.

39:25.784 --> 39:28.985
Samir... think for a minute.

39:29.053 --> 39:32.188
You use that bomb,
you lose your leverage.

39:32.256 --> 39:35.290
The president leaves me
no choice.

39:35.358 --> 39:38.293
The blood will be on her hands.

39:38.361 --> 39:39.995
Samir!

39:53.541 --> 39:54.641
tarin?

39:54.708 --> 39:56.242
Yes?

39:56.310 --> 39:58.845
The president
has not responded.

39:58.912 --> 40:00.846
Start the countdown.

40:00.914 --> 40:03.549
You need to stay with the bomb.

40:03.616 --> 40:06.719
Make sure no one interferes
with it.

40:06.786 --> 40:08.087
Tarin, did you hear me?

40:08.154 --> 40:11.790
Yes, i heard you.

40:11.858 --> 40:14.193
Your name will never
be forgotten, my friend.

40:15.828 --> 40:18.697
Your family will be
honored above all others.
