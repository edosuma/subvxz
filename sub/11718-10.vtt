Kelly.

03:30.186 --> 03:32.404
Yeah, I'll be right there.

03:36.109 --> 03:38.660
Victim's name
is Bethany Morris.

03:38.745 --> 03:40.779
She was a reporter
for the <i>Pacific Register.</i>

03:40.830 --> 03:42.531
What happened?

03:42.615 --> 03:45.334
Based on the abraded injuries
and splinters in her hands,

03:45.418 --> 03:47.703
it would seem
that the victim was hiding

03:47.787 --> 03:49.455
before she was dragged
out from under her bed.

03:49.506 --> 03:51.340
So that's when her
neck was broken.

03:51.424 --> 03:52.491
Correct.
It's very sad.

03:52.619 --> 03:54.036
Yes. Besides that,
we have no prints,

03:54.087 --> 03:55.621
no signs of
forced entry.

03:56.113 --> 03:57.964
Perp was in and out,
very clean, very quick.

03:58.032 --> 03:59.616
So I just got
off the phone

03:59.667 --> 04:01.167
with a Henry Dobson,
Bethany's editor.

04:01.252 --> 04:04.120
She left him a voice mail
just after midnight last night.

04:04.171 --> 04:06.456
Well, based on rigor, that
is within my estimated TOD.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.959
Did he say what
the message was?

04:09.010 --> 04:10.510
Yeah. Bethany told Henry
she was being followed,

04:10.578 --> 04:12.462
and she was going
to e-mail him a file.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.713
He never got it.

04:13.798 --> 04:15.882
Okay, we got a monitor,
keyboard, cables...

04:15.967 --> 04:17.050
no computer tower.

04:17.134 --> 04:18.334
The killer could've taken it.

04:18.386 --> 04:20.853
I wonder what she
was working on.

04:22.189 --> 04:23.473
<i>I don't know what file</i>

04:23.524 --> 04:25.809
Bethany was talking about
when she left the message,

04:25.860 --> 04:27.310
but I'm pretty sure

04:27.361 --> 04:29.345
it had something to do
with Athis Logistics.

04:29.397 --> 04:30.630
Who are they?

04:30.698 --> 04:32.399
One of the largest
shipping companies on Oahu.

04:32.466 --> 04:34.401
Bethany blew the whistle
on them last month

04:34.485 --> 04:35.652
for dumping benzene waste

04:35.703 --> 04:37.687
in the ocean just
two miles off-shore.

04:37.738 --> 04:40.690
They couldn't have been happy
when that story came out.

04:40.741 --> 04:42.158
The day it hit,
company stock

04:42.209 --> 04:43.493
took a dive.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.829
Lost $200 million
in a day.

04:45.896 --> 04:47.163
She started getting
death threats.

04:47.214 --> 04:48.882
Eight in the last three weeks.

04:48.966 --> 04:50.417
Any of them sound legitimate?

04:50.501 --> 04:53.169
The head of my security did
forward me this voice mail

04:53.220 --> 04:56.006
from her office phone
a couple of days ago.

04:56.057 --> 04:57.841
Keep away from Athis.

04:57.892 --> 05:01.044
You publish one more thing,
you're a dead woman.

05:01.095 --> 05:02.812
Sounds legit to me.

05:09.186 --> 05:10.770
Keep away from Athis.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.078
You publish one more thing,
you're a dead woman.

05:14.163 --> 05:16.831
It's a good soundalike,
I'll give you that.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.749
But it's not me.

05:18.817 --> 05:20.201
Voice comparison says it is.

05:20.252 --> 05:21.886
Well, Mr. Schulte,
I'd take

05:21.970 --> 05:23.754
the word of a voice
comparison over you.

05:23.839 --> 05:26.007
Did someone at Athis tell you
to kill Bethany Morris,

05:26.058 --> 05:28.059
or did you just make
that call on the fly?

05:28.143 --> 05:30.761
Was I paid to dig up
some dirt on the reporter?

05:30.846 --> 05:32.897
Maybe scare
her a little?

05:32.981 --> 05:34.348
Sure, I'll
cop to that.

05:34.399 --> 05:35.566
But I didn't kill anybody.

05:35.651 --> 05:37.885
Are you... I mean,
how big of a moron are you?

05:37.936 --> 05:39.887
Huh? A woman
turns up dead

05:39.938 --> 05:42.190
after you leave her
a series of death threats.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.226
Do you think that a jury's
just going to ignore that?

05:46.245 --> 05:48.729
What if I had something

05:48.780 --> 05:50.448
that could help you
find who did this?

05:50.532 --> 05:51.565
We're listening.

05:53.535 --> 05:55.953
The other day,
I followed Morris to Maui.

05:56.038 --> 05:57.705
She spent a couple of hours
there, and then flew back.

05:57.756 --> 05:58.873
Well, what was she doing there?

05:58.924 --> 06:00.074
I don't know.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.576
She went to a small place
up around Kapalua.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.879
Didn't see who she met,
but the person's mail

06:04.930 --> 06:07.414
was addressed to a Jane Woodley.

06:07.466 --> 06:09.100
Couldn't find anything on her.

06:09.184 --> 06:10.268
That's interesting.
It's not quite enough

06:10.352 --> 06:11.886
for a get out of jail
free card, but...

06:11.937 --> 06:13.271
I'm getting to it.

06:13.355 --> 06:14.605
That night, I flew back.

06:14.690 --> 06:16.691
Went to Morris's place in
Chinatown and sat on it.

06:16.758 --> 06:18.926
- All right, when was that?
- Last night.

06:18.977 --> 06:20.761
Night Morris was murdered.

06:20.812 --> 06:23.397
I saw a guy go in there
five minutes before she did.

06:23.448 --> 06:25.283
I thought he lived
in the building,

06:25.367 --> 06:26.868
but then, 15 minutes later,

06:26.935 --> 06:28.736
I see the guy chugging
down the fire escape

06:28.787 --> 06:30.655
with something
under his arm.

06:30.739 --> 06:32.439
Computer tower?
Could've been.

06:32.491 --> 06:34.075
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.210
I tried taking a picture,
but it was dark.

06:36.278 --> 06:38.546
Did manage to get a partial
plate before he took off.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.335
What do you think?

06:44.419 --> 06:45.970
Well, let's run
the plates on the car.

06:46.054 --> 06:47.305
Have Lori do it,

06:47.389 --> 06:49.257
and, uh, how do you feel
about going to Maui?

06:49.308 --> 06:50.841
Let's do it.

06:52.427 --> 06:54.679
<i>Good to see you back</i>
<i>on the island, Jenna.</i>

06:54.763 --> 06:56.463

it was important.

06:56.515 --> 06:58.799
What's up?

06:58.850 --> 07:01.769
I have a favor
to ask you.

07:01.820 --> 07:02.853
It's really big.

07:02.938 --> 07:06.140
Is this about your fiancé?

07:06.191 --> 07:07.992
Ever since I heard
that Josh might be alive

07:08.076 --> 07:09.310
in Southeast Asia,
I have been...

07:09.361 --> 07:11.162
pounding the pavement
back in D.C.

07:11.246 --> 07:14.782
After three months
of analyzing classified intel

07:14.833 --> 07:17.001
and trading favors...

07:17.085 --> 07:18.419
I found him.

07:20.122 --> 07:23.040
Josh is alive.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.326
Are you kidding me?
That's-that's great news, Jenna.

07:25.427 --> 07:26.994
That's incredible.
Do you know where he is?

07:27.045 --> 07:28.879
North Korea.

07:30.048 --> 07:31.349
A, uh...

07:31.433 --> 07:33.968
a small rebel faction is holding
Josh hostage near the border.

07:34.019 --> 07:37.838
They got a hold of him
after a CIA op went bad.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.357
The one I messed up.

07:39.441 --> 07:42.176
Okay. Have you, um... have you
taken this to the Agency?

07:42.227 --> 07:43.728
Yeah.

07:43.812 --> 07:46.230
They can't lift a finger.
They have to disavow

07:46.315 --> 07:47.848
any and all knowledge
of his existence.

07:47.899 --> 07:52.453
S.O.P. for this kind of job,
behind enemy lines, covert op.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.687
What do these rebels want?

07:53.739 --> 07:56.324
They are willing
to exchange Josh

07:56.375 --> 07:58.025
for $250,000,
U.S. currency.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.746
That's where I come in.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.882
What, you can... you're
thinking... wait a minute.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.334
You're seriously considering
going through with this?

08:06.385 --> 08:08.336
If I don't, Josh is dead.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.388
- Jenna...
- Do you understand?

08:10.472 --> 08:13.557
I have no other options
but to pay them.

08:13.642 --> 08:15.259
Well...

08:15.344 --> 08:16.877
okay, have you got
that kind of money?

08:16.928 --> 08:19.380
I sold my parents' house
in Virginia to get it.

08:19.431 --> 08:21.432
It's all I have.

08:24.686 --> 08:26.570
Where's this deal going down?

08:27.606 --> 08:28.889
Their turf.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.993
A small town about 20 miles
south of Kaesong.

08:34.062 --> 08:36.447
I can't go alone, Steve.

08:36.530 --> 08:40.668
I need somebody there
to watch my back.

08:41.703 --> 08:43.703

08:47.926 --> 08:50.411
<i>Yeah. Yes, sir.</i>

supported me in capturing

08:58.220 --> 08:59.753

has been redeployed.

08:59.805 --> 09:03.424

09:12.651 --> 09:14.068
a puddle-jumper to Lana'i.

09:14.119 --> 09:15.486
Okay? This is North Korea.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.289

thank you, Danny.

09:18.373 --> 09:20.291

concern that I see?

09:42.147 --> 09:43.814
Yeah, jerk.

09:43.899 --> 09:45.649

all right?

09:45.734 --> 09:47.134

What could go wrong?

09:47.185 --> 09:48.436

- Hi.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.770
Do me a favor

09:49.821 --> 09:51.638
I'll think about you
the whole time.

09:51.690 --> 09:52.656
Thanks.

09:52.741 --> 09:55.309
- Hmm. What did I miss?
- Nothing.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.610
He's, uh, got to
go help a friend.

09:56.661 --> 09:58.362
He'll be gone a couple days.

11:48.390 --> 11:49.590
No, just wait. Just wait.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.262
No guns.

11:55.313 --> 11:56.697
Bring money.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.434
You bring guns,
we shoot.

12:06.591 --> 12:07.791
Damn it, listen to me.

12:07.876 --> 12:09.660
Listen to me.
That is not your fiancé.

12:09.744 --> 12:11.912
That man is 5'9".

12:11.963 --> 12:12.913
He's got tan skin.

12:12.964 --> 12:14.048
He's a healthy
185 pounds.

12:14.115 --> 12:15.216
Okay? It's not Josh.

12:17.802 --> 12:19.320
- Let me go, Steve.
- Not going to let you go.

12:19.387 --> 12:22.306
We got to move. We got to go
the other way right now.

12:55.173 --> 12:57.925
I'm sorry.

13:36.765 --> 13:38.599
How long's she been
working for you?

13:38.666 --> 13:40.517
Hmm?

13:42.387 --> 13:45.472
That story she sold me about
her fiancé-- is it true?

13:47.058 --> 13:48.943
Huh?

13:54.866 --> 13:56.900
<i>I just tried Steve's</i>
<i>satellite phone</i>

13:56.968 --> 13:59.153
20 times in
the last hour.

13:59.204 --> 14:00.237
No answer.

14:00.322 --> 14:01.989
The area they're in
is all deep forest.

14:02.057 --> 14:03.207
It may have blocked
the signal.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.292
No, something is wrong.
Something is wrong.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.361
Otherwise,
why would Jenna lie to us?

14:08.830 --> 14:11.048
My question is,
did Jenna have anything to do

14:11.132 --> 14:12.166
with Bethany Morris's murder?

14:12.217 --> 14:13.751
Hey.

14:13.835 --> 14:15.002
- Any word from Steve?
- No, nothing.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.837
Okay, look, there's
got to be a number

14:16.888 --> 14:19.223
of logical explanations
as to why he's not answering.

14:19.307 --> 14:21.425
There's nothing logical
about this. Okay?

14:21.509 --> 14:22.843
We just found
out that someone

14:22.894 --> 14:24.345
we worked with--
someone that we trusted--

14:24.396 --> 14:25.879
has been lying to us for months

14:25.930 --> 14:28.048
and now might have something
to do with our murder.

14:28.099 --> 14:29.566
The only way we're
going to get answers

14:29.651 --> 14:31.101
to any of this is by finding
Bethany Morris's killer.

14:31.186 --> 14:33.404
Lori, did you get
anything on the suspect

14:33.488 --> 14:35.072
Schulte said he saw scrambling
out of Bethany's place?

14:35.156 --> 14:37.157
Yeah, I got a hit
off his partial plate.

14:37.225 --> 14:39.243
It was a rental booked
under the name Sung Paek.

14:39.327 --> 14:40.694
DL's a fake, so I ran the name

14:40.745 --> 14:42.946
against hotel registries across
the island-- I got a match.

14:43.031 --> 14:44.498
Kail Inn.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.589
Gun!

15:02.550 --> 15:05.052
Clear.

15:05.103 --> 15:08.105
Took himself out rather
than get caught. Why?

15:08.189 --> 15:10.140
Desperation? Fear?

15:10.225 --> 15:11.892
Fear of what? Prison?

15:11.943 --> 15:13.544
What might happen to him
if he talked to us.

15:13.611 --> 15:16.230
Guys, I think I got
Bethany Morris's computer.

15:16.281 --> 15:17.781
Looks like our guy
was trying to hack into it.

15:17.866 --> 15:18.866
What the hell is that thing?

15:18.933 --> 15:19.950
It's a hard drive
recovery system.

15:20.035 --> 15:23.420
It's used for extracting
encrypted data.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.273
It's a virus.

15:26.324 --> 15:28.125
Uh, Paek must have initiated it
right before we breached.

15:28.209 --> 15:30.027
- Can you stop it?
- No.

15:31.629 --> 15:33.780
There might be a way
to recover what's left, though.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.420
You think you salvaged anything?

15:39.487 --> 15:41.972
Yeah. I managed to recover
a bunch of scattered data,

15:42.040 --> 15:44.725
including a couple pages from
Bethany Morris's latest article,

15:44.792 --> 15:47.311
something called
"Lost Prisoner of Fate."

15:47.395 --> 15:48.762
What's it about?

15:48.813 --> 15:50.297
Well, from what
I could make out,

15:50.348 --> 15:52.132
it's, uh, about something
called Operation Switchback.

15:52.183 --> 15:54.485
That sounds
like a military op.

15:54.569 --> 15:56.253
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Look at this.

15:56.321 --> 15:59.656
It's part of an e-mail
about a classified CIA file

15:59.741 --> 16:02.142
that looks like it's been
95% redacted.

16:02.193 --> 16:03.444
Jenna was CIA.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.112
Maybe that's why Bethany
went to see her.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.497
I checked in with Langley--
they have no

16:06.581 --> 16:07.981
official record
of an op with that name.

16:08.032 --> 16:09.450
- No, they're lying.
- Of course they're lying,

16:09.501 --> 16:10.784
but the interesting
thing was,

16:10.835 --> 16:12.086
when I asked them about it,

16:12.153 --> 16:13.954
they transferred me
to a number in North Carolina.

16:14.005 --> 16:15.172
JSOC headquarters.

16:15.256 --> 16:16.874
Which means
Switchback was a joint

16:16.958 --> 16:18.325
CIA-Special Forces
operation,

16:18.376 --> 16:19.877
so no way we're going to get
intel on that.

16:19.961 --> 16:21.512
Want to bet?

16:23.765 --> 16:26.717
You do realize those are
one-by-twos, right, Wade?

16:26.801 --> 16:29.169
I can measure. Yeah.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.555
Those are for supporting the
windows, not for cross bracing.

16:31.672 --> 16:33.840
Are you implying I don't know
how to build a boar blind?

16:33.892 --> 16:36.343
No, I'm not implying it;
I'm saying it.

16:36.394 --> 16:37.444
Hey, Joe!

16:37.512 --> 16:39.679
Would it kill you to stay
in cell phone range?

16:39.731 --> 16:40.864
Hey, what are you doing
out here?

16:40.949 --> 16:42.900
Listen, Joe, I need to know

16:42.984 --> 16:45.685
everything about
a CIA-Special Forces

16:45.737 --> 16:47.704
joint operation
called Switchback.

16:49.073 --> 16:51.408
Uh, even if it rang a bell,
I couldn't disclose

16:51.493 --> 16:52.526
anything about it.

16:52.577 --> 16:53.961
What's so important
about this op?

16:54.028 --> 16:56.696
I have no idea, but a woman
was murdered over it,

16:56.748 --> 16:58.382
and someone we used to work with

16:58.466 --> 17:00.033
might be involved now--
Jenna Kaye.

17:00.084 --> 17:01.535
Well, why don't you ask her
about it?

17:02.554 --> 17:04.871
Yeah, I would, but, uh, I can't

17:04.923 --> 17:07.307
because she's with Steve
in North Korea.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.425
What?

17:09.426 --> 17:11.228
I think he's in trouble, Joe.

17:30.248 --> 17:31.865
I did what you asked.

17:31.916 --> 17:34.334
Now I want what was promised.

17:34.402 --> 17:37.504
I want to see Josh now.

18:14.959 --> 18:16.943
Josh?

18:46.524 --> 18:48.525
♪ ♪

19:12.634 --> 19:14.301
Hey, it's Jenna.

19:14.352 --> 19:16.103
Get a trace up right now.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.372
Hey. Jenna, it's Danny.
Where are you?

19:18.439 --> 19:19.856
Danny... I'm sorry.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.842
I screwed up.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.194
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

19:24.262 --> 19:26.113
It's okay.
Just tell me, where is Steve?

19:26.180 --> 19:28.065
It's Wo Fat. It's Wo Fat, Danny.

19:28.149 --> 19:30.484
He has him,
and I led Steve right to him.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.269
Is he alive?

19:32.337 --> 19:34.037
We're south of Kaesong--
a town called...

19:34.122 --> 19:36.340
Town called what?
Jenna, you broke up.

19:36.407 --> 19:37.691
Say it again.

19:37.742 --> 19:39.326
No, Jenna, I
can't hear you.

19:39.377 --> 19:41.161
Where's Steve?

19:41.212 --> 19:42.663
Jenna, say it again.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.214
Jenna.

19:44.299 --> 19:45.532
Jenna!

19:47.652 --> 19:48.669
Jenna!

20:21.035 --> 20:22.836
The governor
has to do something.

20:22.903 --> 20:24.871
I don't know.
Steve went into North Korea

20:24.922 --> 20:27.257
on a completely unsanctioned
personal mission.

20:27.342 --> 20:28.908
He thought he
was helping a friend.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.927
Some friend.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.763
- Any word?
- No, we're still waiting

20:32.847 --> 20:34.631
to hear if Danny can get
the governor to help us.

20:34.716 --> 20:35.932
You make any headway
with the military?

20:36.017 --> 20:38.385
Not in terms of rescuing Steve,
but I did get

20:38.436 --> 20:40.604
some interesting intel
about Operation Switchback

20:40.688 --> 20:42.356
that could help us.
What'd you find out?

20:42.423 --> 20:43.640
It was a CIA op

20:43.725 --> 20:44.891
into North Korea
that went bad,

20:44.942 --> 20:48.111
resulted in the capture
of one Officer Joshua Hirsch.

20:48.196 --> 20:49.146
That was Kaye's fiancé.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.430
She took a leave
from Five-O

20:50.481 --> 20:51.448
thinking he could be alive.

20:51.532 --> 20:54.651
Seems a reporter
named Bethany Morris

20:54.736 --> 20:56.069
was asking all about
Operation Switchback,

20:56.120 --> 20:57.654
specifically about
Officer Hirsch.

20:57.739 --> 20:58.772
Why?

20:58.823 --> 21:00.791
She claimed
she had a source

21:00.875 --> 21:02.776
in South Korea
that said he was alive.

21:02.827 --> 21:03.877
And since Jenna Kaye was listed

21:03.944 --> 21:05.162
as the intel officer
for the op...

21:05.246 --> 21:06.279
Bethany Morris

21:06.330 --> 21:07.964
went to see her
to ask her about it.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.833
Okay, so how does this
help us?

21:09.917 --> 21:11.134
Because the unredacted
Switchback file

21:11.219 --> 21:12.586
details the location
of a bunker

21:12.637 --> 21:14.221
just south of Kaesong,

21:14.288 --> 21:16.956
and it's suspected
to be a cache for Wo Fat.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.341
Okay, Kaesong--
isn't that where

21:18.426 --> 21:19.793
Kaye said she was
when they got cut off?

21:19.844 --> 21:20.977
Yeah.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.597
Um, well,
we can forget it,

21:23.648 --> 21:26.850
because even if the governor
appealed to the State Department

21:26.934 --> 21:28.268
about launching
a diplomatic mission,

21:28.319 --> 21:29.636
something like that
could take weeks,

21:29.687 --> 21:31.104
maybe even months,
to get approved.

21:31.155 --> 21:32.239
We don't have that kind of time.

21:32.306 --> 21:33.390
Something needs to
get done right now

21:33.458 --> 21:34.524
or Steve's as good as dead.

21:34.609 --> 21:36.309
That's right.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.311
So what do we do?

21:40.031 --> 21:42.749
We're going to bring Steve home.

21:52.546 --> 21:54.180
Joe, what's with
the medical supplies?

21:54.181 --> 21:56.111
Can't go on a
humanitarian mission

21:56.112 --> 21:57.696
to inoculate villagers
in South Korea

21:57.747 --> 21:59.665
without the proper supplies.
- Ah.

21:59.732 --> 22:00.899
Humanitarian mission.
Right.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.901
It was either that or say
that we were a band

22:02.969 --> 22:05.037
heading over there to
entertain the troops.

22:05.088 --> 22:07.122
So unless you play
a mean bass...

22:07.207 --> 22:10.342
So what happens when we hit
the ground in Seoul?

22:10.410 --> 22:12.244
We're on our own.

22:12.295 --> 22:15.097
I'm going to need
your badges and I.D.'s.

22:15.181 --> 22:17.082
The minute this plane
leaves the ground,

22:17.133 --> 22:19.251
we're just civilians.

22:19.302 --> 22:22.104
That means no military supplies,
fire support

22:22.188 --> 22:23.639
or friendlies in the area.

22:23.723 --> 22:28.110
If the mission is compromised,
we go on escape and evade.

22:28.194 --> 22:32.531
And in the unlikely event
that we pull this off,

22:32.598 --> 22:34.733
we could be charged
with espionage,

22:34.784 --> 22:35.984
face federal prosecution

22:36.069 --> 22:38.770
and prison time
for what we are about to do.

22:38.822 --> 22:41.290
That is, of course,
if any of us make it back.

22:42.826 --> 22:46.628
So if anyone wants to back out,
now is the time.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.547
No shame in it.

22:48.614 --> 22:51.383
Go with God and wish us luck.

23:04.264 --> 23:07.182
All right,
that settles it, then.

23:07.267 --> 23:10.269
We come back with Steve,
or we don't come back.

23:16.276 --> 23:19.411
All right, who's ready
to kick ass and take names?

23:21.564 --> 23:23.082
Got room for a few members

23:23.149 --> 23:26.001
of SEAL Team 9 on this little,
uh... what are you calling it?

23:26.086 --> 23:27.336
Humanitarian mission.

23:27.420 --> 23:28.470
Right. That's what I thought.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.372
Load it up, ladies.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.376
Okay, uh, I thought we weren't
gonna have any military backup.

23:34.461 --> 23:36.161
Yeah, I mean, won't you guys get
in serious trouble for this?

23:36.212 --> 23:40.432
Well, technically, uh,
Team 9 had a few days

23:40.500 --> 23:41.850
of R & R coming,
so we decided

23:41.935 --> 23:43.385
to do some sightseeing in Seoul.

23:44.554 --> 23:47.723
Last I checked,
we owe Commander McGarrett

23:47.807 --> 23:49.174
and Five-O a favor.

23:49.225 --> 23:52.844
About a little midair rescue,
as I recall.

23:52.896 --> 23:54.730
Welcome aboard.

24:29.149 --> 24:30.649
Why?

24:33.052 --> 24:34.386
I had no choice.

24:34.437 --> 24:36.721
We let you in.

24:36.773 --> 24:39.024
We treated you
as one of our own.

24:39.075 --> 24:40.275
I trusted you.

24:42.612 --> 24:45.897
I came down here,
I didn't ask one question.

24:45.949 --> 24:48.333
Wo Fat told me Josh was alive.

24:50.036 --> 24:52.737
You just took him
for his word?

24:52.789 --> 24:53.956
He showed me his ring.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.924
He had pictures.

24:56.009 --> 24:58.343
But more
than anything,

24:58.411 --> 25:00.579
I needed to believe it.

25:02.298 --> 25:04.600
I would have done anything
to save him.

25:06.386 --> 25:09.188
So you decided
to trade him for me.

25:14.594 --> 25:17.145
Yes.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.034
So where is he, Kaye?

25:22.101 --> 25:24.102
Huh?

25:25.872 --> 25:30.125
You have
to understand...

25:30.210 --> 25:34.446
this reporter came to me
looking into Josh's operation.

25:34.497 --> 25:36.381
She said
she had a source

25:36.449 --> 25:38.417
that said
that Josh was alive.

25:39.785 --> 25:44.389
And I thought,
if anyone could survive...

25:47.427 --> 25:49.294
He's a lot like you.

25:49.345 --> 25:52.931
A fighter, you know?

25:54.183 --> 25:57.519
There was this one night...

25:57.604 --> 26:01.657
we were supposed
to have dinner in D.C.

26:01.741 --> 26:04.159
The Capitol Grille.

26:05.245 --> 26:08.530
It was raining,
and he was late,

26:08.615 --> 26:11.333
and his car
wouldn't start,

26:11.417 --> 26:14.319
so he hops on his bike
of all things.

26:15.955 --> 26:17.956
Got in this
horrible accident.

26:18.007 --> 26:20.208
Got hit by a car.

26:20.293 --> 26:22.327
Had to have these pins
put in his knee.

26:22.378 --> 26:24.713
And when I reached
the hospital,

26:24.797 --> 26:26.515
I just lit into him.

26:26.599 --> 26:30.018
He's always rushing around
like that for nothing.

26:33.839 --> 26:36.341
That's when he pulled out
the ring and he said,

26:36.392 --> 26:38.393
"It wasn't for nothing."

26:45.201 --> 26:47.352
The reporter who came to you...

26:47.403 --> 26:50.072
was her name Bethany Morris?

26:51.541 --> 26:53.625
How did you know?

26:53.693 --> 26:56.027
She's dead.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.862
She had her neck snapped.
Did you know that?

26:57.914 --> 26:59.197
No.

26:59.248 --> 27:00.865
You don't get it,
do you, Kaye?

27:00.917 --> 27:04.970
Wo Fat was her source.

27:05.037 --> 27:09.257
He sent... he sent Morris

27:09.342 --> 27:12.227
straight to you to give you hope

27:12.312 --> 27:14.713
that Josh was
still alive.

27:14.764 --> 27:16.932
And my hope got her killed.

27:20.937 --> 27:22.437
<i>All right, me and Joe</i>

27:22.522 --> 27:24.239
have been studying
the Switchback op.

27:24.324 --> 27:25.724

JSOC intel

27:25.775 --> 27:27.225

thermal imaging

27:27.276 --> 27:28.744
of the area where
the team was taken,

27:28.828 --> 27:31.896
satellites have detected
a flurry of recent activity

27:31.948 --> 27:33.281
around this old
Korean War bunker.

27:33.366 --> 27:35.283
Activity in an area
where there shouldn't

27:35.368 --> 27:38.120
be any activity,
and border crossings

27:38.204 --> 27:39.955
where there shouldn't
be border crossings.

27:40.039 --> 27:42.374
All on foot,
all in the last 24 hours.

27:42.425 --> 27:43.908
You think it's
Wo Fat's people?

27:43.960 --> 27:45.093
Bet my life on it.

27:45.178 --> 27:46.461
Thing is, there's
no roads in.

27:46.546 --> 27:49.414
The quickest way
to this compound's by helo.

27:49.465 --> 27:51.266
Anyone know where we
can find one of those?

27:51.351 --> 27:53.018
Yeah, along with a few
automatic weapons?

27:53.085 --> 27:54.770
I know a guy.

27:54.854 --> 27:56.772
What guy?

28:00.810 --> 28:02.277

how you're doing, Frank,

28:26.252 --> 28:29.120
