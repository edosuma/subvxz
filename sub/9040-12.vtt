WANT ME TO DO?

02:06.600 --> 02:11.800

WHAT DID SHE DO?

05:54.500 --> 05:57.733
- NOTHING. SHE'S MAD AT ME.
SHE WAS--

05:57.733 --> 06:01.267
SHE WAS EATING AN ORANGE,
AND SHE STARTED COUGHING.

06:01.267 --> 06:04.133
BUT NOT BIG COUGHING,
YOU KNOW?

06:04.133 --> 06:06.000
AND I GUESS
I SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING

06:06.000 --> 06:07.233
OR SOMETHING.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.133
- IS THAT
WHAT SHE SAID?

06:11.900 --> 06:13.400
SHE SAID
SHE WAS CHOKING,

06:13.400 --> 06:16.767
AND I SHOULD HAVE SAVED
HER LIFE.

RAYMOND,

06:20.267 --> 06:24.600
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND DEBRA
TO BE VERY DEMANDING.

- YOU KNOW,
SO I DIDN'T KNOW

06:27.000 --> 06:31.800
THE EXACT RIGHT THING TO DO
AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT.

YOU WANT ME AROUND, RIGHT?

06:42.867 --> 06:45.500
- WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?

06:46.567 --> 06:47.700
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.033

A FLOOD, A FIRE.

- ARE THERE
OTHER PEOPLE AROUND?

06:54.167 --> 06:56.000

06:56.000 --> 06:57.233
- WELL, IT WAS JUST THAT

06:57.233 --> 06:59.900
WHEN IT COMES TO ACTING
UNDER PRESSURE,

06:59.900 --> 07:01.567

07:01.567 --> 07:03.833
BUT ROBERT HAPPENS
TO BE VERY CAPABLE.

07:03.833 --> 07:07.000
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S HIS JOB.
HE'S HAD TRAINING.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.533
- EVEN BEFORE THE TRAINING.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.500
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SAY
ROBERT'S NOT HERE.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.533

TO A KITTEN, OKAY?

07:14.533 --> 07:18.733
THEN--
THEN YOU WANT ME.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.633
- IS YOUR FATHER AVAILABLE?

07:20.633 --> 07:21.767
- WHAT?

07:21.767 --> 07:23.433
- WELL, LISTEN,
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HIM,

07:23.433 --> 07:25.200
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.600
HE CAN BE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.267
I MEAN, HE'S A FIGHTER.
HE'S GOT THAT INNER RAGE.

07:31.267 --> 07:34.833
ACTUALLY, HE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE TO USE IT.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.533
- AND YOU LIKE THAT?

07:36.533 --> 07:38.333
YOU'RE THE ONE
ALWAYS COMPLAINING

07:38.333 --> 07:39.667
THAT HE ISN'T SENSITIVE ENOUGH.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.467
- BUT YOU JUST DON'T WANT
SENSITIVE.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.933
I MEAN, SENSITIVE DOESN'T
SCARE OFF A BURGLAR

07:43.933 --> 07:47.200
OR--OR A PEEPING TOM.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.600
- THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM
AROUND HERE, IS IT?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.200
- HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE

07:54.200 --> 07:57.600
TO MAKE
A FRICKIN' SANDWICH?

07:57.600 --> 08:01.033
- YOU CAN'T RUSH
THE LOVE, FRANK.

08:01.033 --> 08:04.467
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY FIGHTER,
OKAY, MA? I'M TOUGH TOO.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.267
- CHAIR.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.900
- I'M TOUGH
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.233
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:10.233 --> 08:12.200
MARIE, CHIPS.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.933
- I'M TALKING
THAT I'M TOUGH.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.200
- TOUGH TO RESIST.

08:24.033 --> 08:26.433
- COME ON, BIG SHOT,
ARM-WRESTLE.

08:26.433 --> 08:28.500
- OH, FRANK, TAKE YOUR ELBOW
OFF THE TABLE.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.633
- RELAX.
YOU CAN HAVE WINNERS.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.900
COME ON.
I'M WAITING, SADIE.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.467
- LOOK, I'M NOT ARM-WRESTLING
YOU, OKAY, YOU MANIAC?

08:35.467 --> 08:37.233
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO PROVE.

08:37.233 --> 08:41.167
- WELL, THEN THAT PROVES
SOMETHING, DOESN'T IT?

08:43.800 --> 08:46.300
- DON'T--DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.000
YOU'RE A SWEET BOY,
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.200
- I'M NOT SWEET!

08:50.200 --> 08:51.633
- ALL RIGHT,
DON'T GET UPSET.

08:51.633 --> 08:53.400
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY
IS THAT YOU'RE SWEET,

08:53.400 --> 08:54.667
BUT YOU'RE ALSO MANLY.

08:54.667 --> 08:58.600
YOU'RE A STRAPPING,
VIRILE MAN.

- SAID HIS MOMMY.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.167
- I'M NOT ONLY
HIS MOMMY, FRANK.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.067
I'M ALSO A WOMAN.

09:06.067 --> 09:09.500
- OH, GOD.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.867
- AND YOU ALWAYS DO THINGS
LIKE THAT.

09:10.867 --> 09:13.067
I REMEMBER YOU GETTING
IN FIGHTS ALL THE TIME.

09:13.067 --> 09:15.300
- GETTING PICKED ON,
YOU MEAN.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.800
A WEDGIE IS NOT A FIGHT.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.900
- DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BOY
WHO WAS BOTHERING YOU,

09:19.900 --> 09:21.933
AND YOU WALLOPED HIM?

09:21.933 --> 09:23.300
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT,

09:23.300 --> 09:25.333
ROBERT'S FRIEND
ALBERT GOMEZ.

09:25.333 --> 09:28.400
- HOW OLD
WAS THIS BRUISER, 10?

09:28.400 --> 09:31.133
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION, DAD,
I WAS 10, OKAY?

09:31.133 --> 09:33.900
HE WAS 12 1/2.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.233
- OOH.

09:36.233 --> 09:37.900
- HE CALLED ME
"BIG-NOSE BARONE,"

09:37.900 --> 09:39.433
AND I SAID, "STOP."

09:39.433 --> 09:42.567
HE SAID--
HE SAID, "OKAY, B.N.B."

09:42.567 --> 09:44.167
I KNEW
WHAT THAT MEANT, YEAH.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.367
SO I PUNCHED HIM
IN THE STOMACH,

09:46.367 --> 09:48.500
AND HE WENT DOWN
LIKE A SACK OF DOORKNOBS.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.167
YEAH. IT WASN'T
"BIG-NOSE BARONE" ANYMORE.

09:51.167 --> 09:54.167
IT WAS "SUPER PUNCH."

09:54.167 --> 09:56.433
- AND YOU DON'T HAVE
A BIG NOSE, DEAR.

09:56.433 --> 10:00.200
IT'S PERFECT
FOR YOUR FACE.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.833
- IT'S PERFECT
FOR TWO FACES.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.133
- OH, FRANK.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.667
- ALL RIGHT, DAD, HUH?

10:05.667 --> 10:06.633
KNOCK IT OFF.

10:06.633 --> 10:10.200
- EASY THERE, SUPER PUNCH.
- YEAH.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.133
- WHAT DID THEY CALL YOU, HUH?
SUPER PAUNCH?

10:13.133 --> 10:16.367
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.733
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

10:17.733 --> 10:19.000
- OH, COME ON, NOW.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.800
STOP IT.
AND NOT ON MY EGG SALAD.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.967
- READY?

10:22.967 --> 10:26.267
- GO.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.033
- I'M JUST PLAYING
WITH YOU.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.000
- YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.933
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.067
- OH.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.333
- [laughs]

10:39.333 --> 10:40.900
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, KID?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.700
IT'S MY TV ARM.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.867
- YOU'RE A BULLY, FRANK.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.033
- COME ON,
TWO OUT OF THREE.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.833
AHH, MY FUNNY BONE!
AHH, AHH.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.433
- FRANK, SEE WHAT YOU DID?
- OH, IT'S TINGLY.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.667
- HE'S HURT.
- AHH, TINGLY.

10:53.667 --> 10:57.500
- I'LL TAKE
HIS SANDWICH TOO.

11:03.867 --> 11:05.300
- HEY.
- HEY, NEMO.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.300
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
IF SOMEBODY'S CHOKING?

11:08.300 --> 11:12.933
- CHANGE THE SPECIAL.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.567
- YEAH, THANKS.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.733
- HEY, RAY,
HOW'S IT GOING?

11:16.733 --> 11:18.133
- HEY, YOU WERE LATE.

11:18.133 --> 11:19.633
WE ORDERED PIZZA
WITH JALAPENOS, DEAL WITH IT.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.767
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:21.767 --> 11:24.500
WHAT, YOU WEAR THE UNIFORM
EVERYWHERE NOW?

11:26.433 --> 11:28.333
- I'M ON A LUNCH BREAK.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.433
THEY MAKE US WEAR THESE
FOR WORK.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.400
- [scoffs]

11:33.400 --> 11:34.933
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

11:34.933 --> 11:38.400
- NOTHING.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.800
YOU'RE A BAD BROTHER.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.000
- HEY, DON'T SAY THAT.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.433
A BROTHER IS A FRIEND
GIVEN BY NATURE.

11:49.433 --> 11:51.367
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
RAYMOND'S MAD AT ME

11:51.367 --> 11:53.767
BECAUSE I SHOWED DEBRA
THE HEIMLICH MANEUVER.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.967
- IS THAT A EUPHEMISM?

11:56.967 --> 11:58.367
- YOU DON'T COME
INTO MY HOUSE

11:58.367 --> 12:00.567
AND TRY TO SHOW ME UP
IN FRONT OF MY WIFE.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.233
- HE LET HER
ALMOST CHOKE TO DEATH.

12:02.233 --> 12:03.533
- WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.667
- SHE WAS COUGHING
ON A PIECE OF FRUIT!

12:05.667 --> 12:08.400
ONLY THANKS TO THIS BOY SCOUT,
SHE THINKS I'M USELESS NOW.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.233
- I'D RATHER BE A BOY SCOUT
THAN A GIRL SCOUT.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.600
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.733
- I'M SAYING

12:15.733 --> 12:18.700
I'LL TAKE A BOX
OF THIN MINTS, SWEETIE.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.433
- THAT'S FUNNY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:21.433 --> 12:23.067
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DRINK, RAY?

12:23.067 --> 12:24.467
- I'LL HAVE A COKE.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.133
- YOU WANT TO ARM-WRESTLE
FOR IT?

12:26.133 --> 12:29.100
[laughter]

12:29.100 --> 12:31.933
- THAT'S GOOD.
THAT IS GOOD.

12:31.933 --> 12:35.700
- DAD HAD ME PAGED
AT WORK.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.367
- DID HE TELL YOU
THAT HE CHEATED, HUH?

12:37.367 --> 12:38.967
HE WAS USING
HIS WHOLE BODY,

12:38.967 --> 12:42.333
NOT TO MENTION
HIS BREATH.

12:42.333 --> 12:43.700
- YOUR DAD'S A REAL MAN.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.233
HE DOES WHAT IT TAKES
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.933
- I GET THE JOB DONE.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.033
- OH, WE'RE GETTING
SOME CONFLICTING REPORTS.

12:50.033 --> 12:53.133
APPARENTLY YOU'RE WEAKER
THAN A FEEBLE OLD GEEZER,

12:53.133 --> 12:56.100
AND YOU ALMOST LOST
YOUR BRIDE TO AN ORANGE.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.567
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
JUST SHUT UP.

12:57.567 --> 12:58.733
- COME ON, RAY.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.400
OUR BODIES ARE COVERED
WITH HAIR FOR A REASON.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.667
- TO NAUSEATE
YOUR FELLOW DINERS?

13:03.667 --> 13:04.967
- 'CAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MEN,

13:04.967 --> 13:06.333
AND, RAY,

13:06.333 --> 13:08.467
AS YOUR FRIEND,
I CAN HONESTLY SAY,

13:08.467 --> 13:10.567
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR
AND PROTECT YOUR WOMAN,

13:10.567 --> 13:13.700
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WAY
AND GIVE ME A SHOT.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.400
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.933
LOOK, LOOK, COME ON.
DEBRA WOULD NEVER GO FOR YOU.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.433
- OH, AND WHO WOULD SHE
GO FOR, YOU?

13:19.433 --> 13:21.133
- I DON'T EVEN THINK
THAT'S A QUESTION.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.167
- ALL RIGHT,
WOULD YOU BOTH SHUT UP?

13:23.167 --> 13:24.400
- [stutters]
I'M SERIOUS.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.500
MY LEGS ARE TALLER
THAN YOU.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.200
- OH, YEAH?
YOU'RE A REAL MAN?

13:31.200 --> 13:34.233
CHECK THIS OUT.
I SHAVED AN HOUR AGO.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.733
- AGAIN WITH THE HAIR?
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

13:36.733 --> 13:38.867
- ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND,
WHO WOULD DEBRA PICK FIRST, HUH?

13:38.867 --> 13:40.367
ME OR GIANNI?
- WHOA!

13:40.367 --> 13:42.700
- HEY, I'M NOT NECESSARILY
OUT OF THIS.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.200
- IF RAYMOND GOES,
I'M THE BROTHER.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.900
I GET HER.
IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.800
- WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
- OKAY.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.333
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

13:50.333 --> 13:52.033
WOULD EVERYBODY
JUST LEAVE RAYMOND ALONE?

13:52.033 --> 13:53.967
HE'S OBVIOUSLY SENSITIVE,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.000
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.567
THAT'S WHAT
THE LADIES LIKE.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.033
- ANDY,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

14:00.033 --> 14:04.367
YOU HAVE
TO BLOW UP YOUR LADY.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.967
- I DO FINE
WITH THE WOMEN.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.033
THEY FIND ME
CUDDLY AND CUTE,

14:18.033 --> 14:19.133
AND WHEN THEY POKE ME
IN THE BELLY,

14:19.133 --> 14:22.100
I GO--
[giggles]

14:24.000 --> 14:26.333
[giggles]

14:26.333 --> 14:29.533
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
I WASN'T GOING TO BACK IT UP?

14:29.533 --> 14:32.033
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM,
RAYMOND.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.800
YOU ARE NOT USELESS.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.300
GUYS LIKE US
DON'T HAVE TO GET CAUGHT UP

14:35.300 --> 14:36.833
IN THESE STEREOTYPICAL
GENDER ROLES

14:36.833 --> 14:39.000
WHERE THE MAN HAS
TO TAKE CARE OF THE WOMAN.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
- YEAH, OKAY.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.267
THANK YOU, ANDY,

14:41.267 --> 14:42.533
BUT YOU'RE REALLY NOT
HELPING ME

14:42.533 --> 14:45.333
WITH THE ME-TO-YOU
COMPARISON, OKAY?

14:45.333 --> 14:47.633
I DON'T WANT TO BE
TAKEN CARE OF.

14:47.633 --> 14:48.900
- [laughs]

14:48.900 --> 14:50.400
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

14:50.400 --> 14:51.900
- I'M JUST NOTING THE IRONY
IN YOUR STATEMENT,

14:51.900 --> 14:53.333
IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACT

14:53.333 --> 14:57.033
THAT YOU LIVE ACROSS THE STREET
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.367
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:58.367 --> 15:00.000
YOU LIVED THERE
FOR 35 YEARS.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.133
- LIVED, LIVED--
PAST TENSE.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.867
I'M NOW
MILES AWAY FROM THEM...

15:04.867 --> 15:09.333
1.38 MILES.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.700
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE THE PERSON

15:10.700 --> 15:12.567
I SHOULD BE
TAKING ADVICE FROM, ROBERT.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.100
- LOOK, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU OUT HERE, RAYMOND,

15:14.100 --> 15:16.767
BUT YOU GOT TO BRING
SOMETHING TO THE TABLE.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.000
NOW, ANDY,
HE'S CUTE AND SQUISHABLE,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.767
GIANNI IS HAIRY AND SCARY,

15:20.767 --> 15:24.233
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
THE PERFECT AMALGAM.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.367
YOU HEARD ME, AMALGAM.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.267
YOU, YOU'RE
NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.667
- YEAH, OKAY, LOOK,

15:33.667 --> 15:35.567
I DON'T HAVE
TO DEFEND MYSELF TO YOU IDIOTS.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.233
I'M NOT THE PERFECT MAN,
BUT I-I'M PRETTY SURE

15:38.233 --> 15:41.133
I'M THE ONLY ONE SITTING HERE
WHO HAS A WOMAN.

15:41.133 --> 15:44.567
- FOR NOW.

15:44.567 --> 15:46.133
- OH, YEAH.

15:46.133 --> 15:51.033
HA HA.
VERY FUNNY, COUSIN IT.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.400
DEBRA HAPPENS
TO LIKE THE FACT

15:52.400 --> 15:53.667
THAT I HAVE
JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HAIR

15:53.667 --> 15:56.267
IN JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT
OF PLACES.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.900
- OH, I'M SURE THAT WAS
A COMFORTING LAST THOUGHT

15:58.900 --> 16:01.467
BEFORE SHE BLACKED OUT.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.900
[imitating Debra choking]
RAYMOND'S BODY'S SO SMOOTH,

16:04.900 --> 16:08.400
LIKE A HAIRLESS...CAT.

16:13.067 --> 16:15.000
- YEAH, BYE.
BYE-BYE.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.400
- HEY, COME ON,
WHERE YOU GOING?

16:16.400 --> 16:18.200
THE PIZZA'S COMING.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.800
- YEAH, I'M GOING HOME
TO MY WIFE, OKAY?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
MY WIFE, ALL RIGHT?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.267
AND EVERYTHING IS FINE
IN MY HOUSE.

16:23.267 --> 16:27.233
I HAPPEN TO BE
ALL THE MAN SHE NEEDS.

16:27.233 --> 16:31.033
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.967
- HEY, THERE, SLIM-FAST.

16:38.967 --> 16:40.400
OH, GIVE ME THOSE BAGS.
HERE.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.633
- IT'S OKAY. I GOT THEM.
- NO, LET ME TAKE THEM.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.267
- I GOT IT.
- I WANT THEM. NO.

16:43.267 --> 16:44.467
WHERE DO THEY GO?

16:44.467 --> 16:48.400
- RIGHT HERE.
- OH.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.867
ALL RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE?

16:50.867 --> 16:52.167
- NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:52.167 --> 16:54.200
- OH, JUST TAKING CARE
OF A FEW THINGS.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.233
YOU KNOW, I CHECKED
THE SMOKE DETECTORS.

16:56.233 --> 16:57.567
I CHANGED A LIGHT BULB,

16:57.567 --> 17:01.133
SQUASHED A BUG,
UH, YEAH...

17:01.133 --> 17:04.533
MADE A CRACKLING NOISE.
DIDN'T BOTHER ME, YEAH.

17:04.533 --> 17:06.467
WHAT ELSE?
ANY BAGS LEFT IN THE CAR?

17:06.467 --> 17:08.233
- UH-UH.
- HEY, HOW'S THE CAR DRIVING?

17:08.233 --> 17:09.433
YOU WANT ME
TO POP THE HOOD

17:09.433 --> 17:14.333
AND CHECK
UNDER THE, UH, THING?

17:14.333 --> 17:17.200
- NO, THE CAR IS--
IT'S REALLY FINE.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.567
WHERE'S THE KETCHUP?

17:18.567 --> 17:21.500
OH, COME ON.
I KNOW I BOUGHT KETCHUP.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.567
I BET THEY DIDN'T PUT IT
IN THE BAG.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.767
- THOSE SONS OF BITCHES.
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.067
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.267
WAIT. FOUND IT.

17:28.267 --> 17:29.367
- YOU GOT IT?
ALL RIGHT.

17:29.367 --> 17:30.700
'CAUSE I'D GO DOWN THERE.

17:30.700 --> 17:36.133
I'D COME BACK
WITH TWO KETCHUPS.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.867
- YOU OKAY?

17:37.867 --> 17:39.133
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S COOL.

17:39.133 --> 17:40.367
YOU KNOW, JUST TAKING CARE
OF THINGS.

17:40.367 --> 17:41.567
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:41.567 --> 17:43.267
- JUST GOING TO PUT
THE STOOL BACK.

17:43.267 --> 17:44.633
- NO, NO, NO, I'LL TAKE IT.

17:44.633 --> 17:45.833
- NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CARRY IT.

17:45.833 --> 17:46.967
- OW!
- WHAT?

17:46.967 --> 17:49.800
- SPLINTER.
- OH, I'M SORRY.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.067
[chair crashes]

17:51.067 --> 17:52.533
SPLINTER?
NO, I CAN DO THAT.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.033
I CAN DO THAT.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

17:54.033 --> 17:55.433
- YOU GOT A SPLINTER.
I'M ON IT.

17:55.433 --> 17:57.033
- YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.
I CAN GET IT OUT.

17:57.033 --> 17:58.967
- NO, LOOK, DON'T WORRY.
UH, EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.033
I'M HERE, OKAY? TWEEZERS,
WHERE ARE THE TWEEZERS?

18:01.033 --> 18:02.333

18:02.333 --> 18:04.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:14.700 --> 18:16.200

18:18.600 --> 18:20.467
PLEASE, WILL YOU STOP IT?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.800
SIT DOWN!

18:25.467 --> 18:26.667
COME ON!

18:26.667 --> 18:28.667
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:28.667 --> 18:30.133

18:32.300 --> 18:34.600
RAY!
RAY, LOOK.

18:34.600 --> 18:39.333
HONEY, HONEY.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.233
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE A MAN

18:41.233 --> 18:42.467
BY TAKING
MY SPLINTER OUT?

18:42.467 --> 18:45.367
- JUST ADMIT IT,

18:45.367 --> 18:47.000
NOW, GIVE ME THE SPLINTER!

18:47.000 --> 18:48.667

RAY, GET OFF OF ME!

18:48.667 --> 18:52.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE TOTALLY INSANE!

18:52.733 --> 18:55.800

GIVE ME THE SPLINTER!

18:58.600 --> 18:59.933
STOP IT!

HONEY, COME ON!

19:10.500 --> 19:11.700

IT'S THE WRONG HAND!

19:16.200 --> 19:18.233
- WELL, STOP STRUGGLING!

19:18.233 --> 19:20.067
YOU GOT ME
ALL TURNED AROUND HERE!

19:20.067 --> 19:21.967
JUST RELAX.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.633
- YOUR KNEE IS IN MY RIB.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.933
- THAT'S OKAY.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.067
- JUST STOP IT
FOR A MINUTE.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.100
JUST A MINUTE.
JUST ONE MINUTE.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.500
- WHAT?

19:29.500 --> 19:33.000
- LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.067
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO IT.

19:35.067 --> 19:38.067
I MEAN, I THINK
I OVERREACTED YESTERDAY,

19:38.067 --> 19:40.167
AND I'M SORRY
IF I DID, HONEY.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.867
- NO.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

19:42.867 --> 19:45.000
I SHOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.733
I SCREWED UP.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.233
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

19:48.233 --> 19:51.733
NO, HONEY, I THINK
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL HUSBAND.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.000
- NO, YOU DON'T.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.300
- OH, YES, I DO.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.833
[pats him]
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

19:58.833 --> 20:02.200
HMM?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.667
COME HERE.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.100
CAN I GET UP NOW?

20:11.100 --> 20:12.533
- I GOT TO GET
THAT SPLINTER.

20:12.533 --> 20:13.900
- OH, HONEY, PLEASE.
- I'M GOING TO GET IT.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.200
- SWEETIE, NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.567
- I'M GETTING IT.
I'M GETTING IT.

20:16.567 --> 20:18.700
- DON'T DO IT.
IT'S HURTING ME!

20:18.700 --> 20:21.733
- GOT IT! YEAH!

20:21.733 --> 20:23.800
OH, YEAH!

20:23.800 --> 20:26.733
OH, YOU PICKED
THE WRONG GUY'S WIFE

20:26.733 --> 20:29.733
TO GO INTO, SPLINTER.

20:29.733 --> 20:33.267
WHOO-HOO!

20:35.833 --> 20:38.233
AND STAY OUT!

20:38.233 --> 20:41.267
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT!

20:41.267 --> 20:42.600
- THANKS, RAY.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.500
- YOU SEE? GOES ONE WAY,
AND IT JUTS ANOTHER WAY.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.167
THAT'S WHY IT WAS HARD
TO RIP OUT OF YOU.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.433
- YEAH.
OKAY.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.133
- ALL RIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:52.133 --> 20:54.100
- GOT TO GO GET A BAND-AID NOW
'CAUSE IT'S BLEEDING.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.067
- OH, THERE IS BLOOD.
- YEAH.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.300
- YEAH. YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH?

20:57.300 --> 20:59.000
YEAH.
- YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.867
- NO, NO.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.000
FINE.
THAT'S OKAY.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.333
- ALL RIGHT.

21:03.333 --> 21:07.667
I'M RIGHT HERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

21:07.667 --> 21:11.267
I DON'T LIKE BLOOD.

21:20.067 --> 21:22.600
AND THEN
THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS SAID,

21:22.600 --> 21:25.500
"OH, BRAVE
AND HANDSOME KNIGHT,

21:25.500 --> 21:29.533
"THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THAT PAINFUL WOODEN SPIKE

21:29.533 --> 21:33.667
"OUT OF MY HAND.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.400
"I WILL MARRY YOU.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.533
I'M LUCKY TO MARRY YOU."

21:39.533 --> 21:41.733
AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE REJOICED,

21:41.733 --> 21:43.933
EXCEPT FOR THE GIANT,

21:43.933 --> 21:48.033
EVIL, COWARDLY BROTHER,

21:48.033 --> 21:51.067
WHO WAS BANISHED
FROM THE KINGDOM FOREVER

21:51.067 --> 21:56.167
AND HAD TO LIVE
1.38 MILES AWAY.

21:56.167 --> 22:01.167
- YAY, YAY, YAY.
- YAY.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.333
- [sarcastic]
MY HERO.
