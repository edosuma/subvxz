00:02.600 --> 00:04.700
(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.000
And then my weekend nanny

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
had another death
in the family--again.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.800
Can you believe
the luck I'm having?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.367
(Brooke)
Actually, it was
the worst summer.

00:12.367 --> 00:13.367
We were flying
back and forth

00:13.367 --> 00:14.800
from Capri
to South Hampton.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.167
I'm overseeing
two renovations.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.767
That's two sets
of blueprints.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.700
I need a vacation
from my vacation.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.200
Where do you guys
summer, again?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.667
We summer on 61st Street
between 2nd and 3rd.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.233
Mm.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.500
(Mrs. Hardwick)
Welcome, everyone.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.733
We're delighted to have you
here at our curriculum night.

00:34.733 --> 00:36.700
Curriculum night, please.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.300
They're in preschool.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.800
What's next, they're gonna major
in finger-painting and sand?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.567
And while you've been busy

00:42.567 --> 00:46.533
working on those
kindergarten applications,

00:46.533 --> 00:47.767
we've been busy too,

00:47.767 --> 00:50.833
learning a little bit
about you.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.767
Rutherford says,

00:53.767 --> 00:56.267
"My mommy loves salad,

00:56.267 --> 00:59.900
Pinot Grigio,
and our helicopter."

00:59.900 --> 01:01.467
[laughter]

01:01.467 --> 01:06.167
Piper says,
"My daddy's a plastic surgeon.

01:06.167 --> 01:12.067
He loves his Maseratis and
making people's faces not ugly."

01:12.067 --> 01:14.133
[laughter]

01:14.133 --> 01:17.700
And this from Dottie--

01:17.700 --> 01:20.833
"My mommy loves tattoos,

01:20.833 --> 01:23.833
"underwear dance parties,

01:23.833 --> 01:26.067
and bad words."

01:28.733 --> 01:31.467
Oh, [bleep].

01:31.467 --> 01:33.600
[upbeat rock music]

01:33.600 --> 01:36.200
* I guess you know *

01:36.200 --> 01:39.333
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:39.333 --> 01:40.867
Mommy!

01:46.733 --> 01:49.167
Mommy, why is your butt
so jiggly?

01:49.167 --> 01:51.367
Because I have three kids.

01:51.367 --> 01:52.667
Thanks, Miles.

01:52.667 --> 01:53.867
Guys, okay you have
to get dressed.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.267
We're gonna do the thing
for Daddy, okay?

01:55.267 --> 01:56.433
Hurry, please.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.067
Hey, guys,
come on, get dressed.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.800
No, you're too early!

01:59.800 --> 02:02.100
I had a whole
surprise for you.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.400
For me?
Oh, well...

02:03.400 --> 02:05.700
Congratulations
on making partner.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.067
- We're so proud of you.
- Thank you.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.333
It was gonna be
a whole spread

02:09.333 --> 02:10.833
with eggs and fruit
and everything.

02:10.833 --> 02:12.500
It was like a miracle.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.233
Did you hear Miles
ridiculing my "thass"?

02:15.233 --> 02:16.633
What's "thass?"

02:16.633 --> 02:18.400
"Thigh" plus "ass"
equals "thass."

02:18.400 --> 02:19.667
And after three kids,

02:19.667 --> 02:22.700
my vag is like
the Holland Tunnel.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
Sometimes I walk around,
and it sounds

02:24.600 --> 02:26.267
like somebody's stirring
mac and cheese.

02:26.267 --> 02:27.667
Are we having
mac and cheese tonight?

02:27.667 --> 02:28.767
I said get dressed!

02:28.767 --> 02:31.333
(Andy)
Get dressed please.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.500
I don't know.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.400
I think everything's
holding up great.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.433
In fact, I was thinking,

02:35.433 --> 02:37.400
what if I went
into work late today?

02:37.400 --> 02:39.167
Honey, I know
it's your special day,

02:39.167 --> 02:41.067
but there was just a study
at Stanford University...

02:41.067 --> 02:42.433
(Miles)
Mommy, can I crack an egg?

02:42.433 --> 02:43.767
That all these mothers
have sensory overload--

02:43.767 --> 02:45.067
[kids shouting]

02:45.067 --> 02:46.833
'Cause the kids are, like,
pawing them all day,

02:46.833 --> 02:48.433
and so we're, like,
OD-ing on touch.

02:48.433 --> 02:49.900
- Right.
- Okay?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.100
And we have
to pick the photos

02:51.100 --> 02:52.533
for the kids'
kindergarten applications.

02:52.533 --> 02:53.700
- Yep.
- We have to pick today.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.733
Come here.

02:54.733 --> 02:55.733
(Miles)
Can I have gum for breakfast?

02:55.733 --> 02:57.100
Nope, no gum.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.267
Do you think Miles looks
a little R-A-P-E-Y here?

02:59.267 --> 03:00.567
[phone ringing]

03:00.567 --> 03:03.067
Who calls anymore?

03:03.067 --> 03:04.200
My mother.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.600
Okay, guys, did you
brush your teeth yet?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.767
- Hello, Mother.
- Isn't it wonderful news?

03:08.767 --> 03:10.733
Uh, yeah, thanks,
how'd you hear?

03:10.733 --> 03:14.133
The New York Times, CNN,
Bloomberg News.

03:14.133 --> 03:16.600
It's on the front page
of every business section.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.867
Oh, I thought you were
calling about my news.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.500
I'm just catching up,
one second.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.767
I'll save you
the trouble.

03:21.767 --> 03:24.067
Hercules Partners,
your baby brother's firm,

03:24.067 --> 03:26.533
sold that bagel company
to the Chinese

03:26.533 --> 03:29.433
for $675 million.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.600
What was your news?

03:32.600 --> 03:33.967
Um...

03:36.733 --> 03:37.733
(man)
Congratulations.

03:37.733 --> 03:38.767
Thank you.

03:38.767 --> 03:40.067
- Congratulations
- Thanks, guys.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.067
Whoo, Andy!

03:42.067 --> 03:44.767
Yes, dude, so give me
the play-by-play.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.067
Oh, but, like, make it like
SportsCenter, though.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.567
I guess it's been
in the works for a while.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.067
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.467
I was always
on the partner track.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.133
No, no, no,
dude, not that.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.133
No, your kid brother, Lex.

03:55.133 --> 03:58.200
Uh, ka-ching.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.633
Bagels.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.533
(Jill)
I mean, they're my in-laws.

04:03.533 --> 04:04.967
I should be
happy for them,

04:04.967 --> 04:06.767
but they're gonna be
even more "insuffs"

04:06.767 --> 04:08.067
than they already are.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.467
It'll be wheels up
to St. Barth's

04:09.467 --> 04:12.267
and wheels up to Aspen
and breakfast at Wimbledon.

04:12.267 --> 04:15.767
I'm a doctor.
I save babies with my hands.

04:15.767 --> 04:18.067
Even if I live
to be "eleventy,"

04:18.067 --> 04:20.133
I'd never see a tenth
of that type of coin.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.767
Lex isn't even
that smart.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.400
His equity firm
just got lucky

04:23.400 --> 04:25.900
investing in the company
that brought bagels to China.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.267
China, I know.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.067
I mean, if it were North Korea,
I'd be impressed.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.600
He and Brooke
are fetuses,

04:31.600 --> 04:34.133
and now they're as rich
as Mark Zuckerberg's pinky.

04:34.133 --> 04:38.833
Okay, you do realize
you're rich too, right?

04:38.833 --> 04:40.367
Yeah, maybe
in the normal universe,

04:40.367 --> 04:41.700
where normal people live.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.733
But between Lexington and 5th,
I'm a charity case.

04:44.733 --> 04:46.133
- Jill!
- Seriously.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.800
People come to our walk-up
for play dates,

04:47.800 --> 04:50.500
and they act like I live
in a cardboard box.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.833
Oh...

04:51.833 --> 04:52.833
sorry.

04:52.833 --> 04:53.933
Oh, my God, it's her.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.700
[bombastic hip-hop]

04:56.700 --> 04:58.200
It's my sister-in-law.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.067
I swear, our kids are
in the same class this year.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.533
I can't escape her.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.633
Wait, I thought she was pregnant
with her fourth.

05:03.633 --> 05:04.867
Did she lose the baby?

05:04.867 --> 05:06.767
No,
she's seven months pregnant.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.500
That baby is gonna be
the size of a Diet Coke can.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.900
Hi, guys.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.433
Brooke, congrats
on the sale.

05:13.433 --> 05:14.533
So exciting.

05:14.533 --> 05:16.067
We're quite pleased.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.367
We're quite pleased
for you.

05:18.367 --> 05:21.167
(Danielle)
Vanessa, I haven't seen you
since we had a white president.

05:21.167 --> 05:22.933
- Oh.
- Still living downtown?

05:22.933 --> 05:25.067
Still toughing it out
on the mean streets of SoHo.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.267
- Huh.
- So baby number four.

05:27.267 --> 05:28.733
Good for you!

05:28.733 --> 05:31.800
[scoffs]
Thanks, I'm Shamu.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.533
All righty, we're gonna
go stuff our faces

05:33.533 --> 05:34.800
at Midnight Express.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.933
(Stephanie)
Oh, I heard they're closing.

05:35.933 --> 05:36.967
You're kidding.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.233
Yeah, it's gonna
be a Flush.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.333
What's a Flush?

05:39.333 --> 05:40.600
It's this
California chainlet

05:40.600 --> 05:42.233
that's part juice cleanse,
part colonics.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.500
It was in Vanity Fair.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.633
(Simone)
It totally works.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.500
My sister had
a toy soldier come out.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.900
(Brooke)
So, Jill, I'm seeing you

05:48.900 --> 05:51.733
at my NACHO Kickoff Event
this week, right?

05:51.733 --> 05:54.167
At Soul Wheelz?
You have yet to RSVP.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.467
Oh, your spinning thing.
I totally spaced.

05:56.467 --> 05:58.700
I've been so swamped with
kindergarten applications.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.900
Wait, back up.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.200
Why are we talking
about nachos?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.267
(Brooke)
No, no, no.

06:02.267 --> 06:03.567
it's my charitable
organization.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.400
New Yorkers Against
Childhood Obesity.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.267
You mean NYACHO?

06:07.267 --> 06:08.600
NACHO.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.267
New Yorkers...

06:10.267 --> 06:11.933
The Y is silent.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.900
It's my charity.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.500
Jill, Soul Wheelz?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.300
Believe me,
you don't want me there.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.800
I will be dead
on the floor.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.467
They'll need
defibrillators.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.733
I'll be
in a chalk outline.

06:21.733 --> 06:22.900
You're my sister-in-law,

06:22.900 --> 06:25.067
and you never come
to any of my events.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.933
Well, it's hard
to line up a sitter.

06:26.933 --> 06:29.167
Oh, Jill, you really
need to staff up.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.833
Well, I'm not
working right now,

06:30.833 --> 06:32.967
so I prefer
to do it myself.

06:32.967 --> 06:34.967
Why don't you take
Stephanie's Thai baby nurse?

06:34.967 --> 06:36.133
You're done
with her, right?

06:36.133 --> 06:37.600
She's Tibetan.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.100
Yeah, well, same noodle,
different sauce.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.767
Let's go.
Bye.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.667
[bell dings]

06:49.667 --> 06:51.333
I can't believe
this place is closing.

06:51.333 --> 06:54.067
I've been coming here
for 30 years.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.833
This place is
an institution.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.833
Look at--look at
this glass bottle.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.633
You know, instead of that
squeezy bull[bleep].

07:00.633 --> 07:03.067
I mean, look
at the people.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.400
What is a Flush anyway?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.600
What do these people do?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.500
Put hoses in their ass
and blow lunch?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.333
Isn't that like
anal bulimia?

07:09.333 --> 07:12.700
People love putting things
in their ass[bleep].

07:12.700 --> 07:15.233
You should see what I see
in the ER on the daily--

07:15.233 --> 07:18.067
iPhone chargers,
bottles of Purell,

07:18.067 --> 07:20.533
old Phantom ticket stubs,

07:20.533 --> 07:21.700
plastic Yodas,

07:21.700 --> 07:23.433
Duane Reade receipts,
pot.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.500
- I hate people.
- I hate people too.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.633
So "grodsky."

07:26.633 --> 07:27.700
A small piccolo.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.767
You know, it's official.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.933
This place closing
just marks the end

07:30.933 --> 07:33.467
of the real, old,
gritty Upper East Side.

07:33.467 --> 07:34.733
"Gritty"?
When?

07:34.733 --> 07:36.433
Before they paved
Park Avenue?

07:36.433 --> 07:37.967
At least when
I was growing up,

07:37.967 --> 07:40.067
there was some shame
around being rich.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.967
I mean, I knew kids who were
mortified to have a driver.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.133
Now at drop-off,

07:44.133 --> 07:46.300
they're pimpin'
cocaine-white SUVs.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.133
And yet you continue
to live here.

07:48.133 --> 07:49.433
I was here first.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.500
I love that you
still eat doughnuts.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.533
Thank you.

07:52.533 --> 07:55.233
A doughnut is just
a gay bagel.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.900
So how are the kids?

07:56.900 --> 07:58.600
Fine, annoying.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.300
They'd be a lot cooler
if they could fill out

08:00.300 --> 08:01.867
their own
kindergarten applications.

08:01.867 --> 08:04.233
Just promise me
you will not turn

08:04.233 --> 08:07.400
into one of those freaky
mom-bots over this stuff.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.800
I would never.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.067
Why do you think
I'm blowing off

08:10.067 --> 08:11.333
Brooke's NACHO thing?

08:11.333 --> 08:12.567
'Cause you hate exercise?

08:12.567 --> 08:14.367
No.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.533
Okay, yes.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.367
But Soul Wheelz
is, like, the first stop

08:17.367 --> 08:18.900
on the mom-bot express.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.067
It's a cult.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.467
Plus, I'm not a joiner.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.600
So don't join
the kindergarten cult either.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.733
Your kids are great.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.933
They'll be fine,
wherever they go.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.433
Oh, you're so naive.

08:29.433 --> 08:30.667
But I'll give you this.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.200
If I ever say
that I'm going

08:32.200 --> 08:36.100
to a $3,000-a-plate
hat luncheon with the ladies,

08:36.100 --> 08:38.700
you have my permission
to kidnap me,

08:38.700 --> 08:39.900
drag me into the woods--

08:39.900 --> 08:41.433
And shoot you?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.233
I was gonna say
"deprogram me,"

08:43.233 --> 08:44.733
but use your judgment.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.100
- Done.
- Okay.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.467
[children chattering]

08:57.467 --> 08:58.500
It's Mrs. Hardwick.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.667
(woman)
It's Mrs. Hardwick.

08:59.667 --> 09:00.733
Hello, Mrs. Hardwick.

09:00.733 --> 09:01.767
Hello, Mrs. Hardwick!

09:01.767 --> 09:03.567
(Mrs. Hardwick)
Mrs. Weber.

09:03.567 --> 09:04.567
Me?

09:04.567 --> 09:08.067
May I see you in my office?

09:08.067 --> 09:11.400
Of course,
Mrs. Hardwick.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.667
(Mrs. Hardwick)
Mrs. Weber,

09:12.667 --> 09:15.433
we've known your family
for several years,

09:15.433 --> 09:17.533
and while we've come
to appreciate your,

09:17.533 --> 09:21.667
shall we say, unorthodox
approach to parenting,

09:21.667 --> 09:25.633
this admissions season
is particularly cut-throat.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.267
These schools are looking
for leaders,

09:28.267 --> 09:29.867
students with vision.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.233
If we give them blocks,

09:32.233 --> 09:36.567
will they make a pile
or the Arc de Triomphe?

09:36.567 --> 09:39.333
Mine usually
just lick the blocks.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.400
- I mean, they're 4.
- Indeed.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.100
And young 4s,

09:43.100 --> 09:45.067
given their
late-July birthdays.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.500
So unfortunate.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.533
They're competing
against children

09:48.533 --> 09:50.533
who have been bred
for success.

09:50.533 --> 09:53.233
Legacy families,
leaders of the community.

09:53.233 --> 09:56.800
And, unfortunately,
while you are different,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.367
you don't technically qualify
as diversity.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.533
Sometimes Miles
looks half Cherokee.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.833
How.
[laughs]

10:06.833 --> 10:09.300
I'm going to recommend

10:09.300 --> 10:11.667
that you cast a wide net.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.300
Yes, we have Miles applying
to five schools,

10:14.300 --> 10:15.633
Dottie to four.

10:15.633 --> 10:17.667
We have our zoned
local public school,

10:17.667 --> 10:19.867
a charter school, and Hunter.

10:19.867 --> 10:23.600
I'm going to recommend
an even wider net.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.133
And Andy was up against,
like, three other lawyers

10:33.133 --> 10:34.733
for this position, right?

10:34.733 --> 10:37.133
It's one of the hardest
firms to move up in.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.233
There they are.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.500
Hi.
Mazel Tov, guys!

10:41.500 --> 10:42.900
Oh, come on, now.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.233
Tonight is Andy's night.

10:44.233 --> 10:45.533
- Oh, are you kidding?
- My big bro!

10:45.533 --> 10:47.867
- Thanks, and congratulations.
- Thank you.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.467
Oh, I can't wait to see
your new letterhead.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.300
Eldridge, Pinkney,
Whitehead & Weber?

10:53.300 --> 10:56.167
Oh, no, they don't change
the name of the firm.

10:56.167 --> 10:57.400
It doesn't work like that.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.433
Oh.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.400
Well, good for you, anyway.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.367
(man)
Ladies.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.400
Oh, yay, bread.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.533
- No!
- No bread!

11:03.533 --> 11:05.800
No bread!

11:05.800 --> 11:08.967
Oh, I have the proofs
from Rutherford's

11:08.967 --> 11:11.900
kindergarten application
photo shoot.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.067
(Candace)
Oh!

11:13.067 --> 11:14.233
Mario Testino.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.667
(Candace)
Oh, of course, of course.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.067
- Oh, precious.
- Yeah.

11:18.067 --> 11:19.300
Jill, who did you hire

11:19.300 --> 11:20.933
to shoot your
children's photographs?

11:20.933 --> 11:22.100
Uh, me.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.733
My rates are great,
and I'm easy to work with.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.967
Oh, right, you and your
little photography hobby.

11:26.967 --> 11:29.333
Mother, it's not a hobby.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.800
Jill shot for tons of magazines
before we had kids.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.333
Yeah, it's like that time
you let me

11:33.333 --> 11:36.833
"drop off a package" at that
Victoria's Secret shoot.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.833
That was awesome.

11:39.833 --> 11:44.200
It was before
I met you, babe.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.800
Anyway,
to Lex and Brooke

11:46.800 --> 11:48.867
and bagels in China.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.233
May they never hear
of Dr. Atkins.

11:51.233 --> 11:54.300
[laughter]

11:54.300 --> 11:56.500
(woman)
So how do you like working
on the Upper East Side?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.700
(Vanessa)
Love it.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.067
This is just such
a nice change of pace

11:59.067 --> 12:00.133
from Bronx Central.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.700
It's so clean here.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.133
And you have toilet paper
in, like, every bathroom stall.

12:04.133 --> 12:07.767
Yeah, it's a great hospital,
even if it has its quirks.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.067
- Heads up.
- Coming through.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.067
Is that a sex machine?
Cool.

12:11.067 --> 12:12.233
Pilates Reformer.

12:12.233 --> 12:14.733
We get eight to ten
workout-related injuries a week.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.967
Jerry, I'm gonna need the
electrical saw and the drill.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.400
Or we could just
cut off her ponytail.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.467
No, not my extensions.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.800
It's Indian hair.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.933
- Like I said, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.400
Oh, Jill,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.133
Mrs. Hardwick
is coming to NACHO.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.300
I'm sponsoring her bike.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.533
Hardwick, seriously?

12:33.533 --> 12:34.733
Why?

12:34.733 --> 12:36.900
Because that woman
has the ear

12:36.900 --> 12:38.967
of every school
we're applying to.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.867
And if you come,
it'll remind her

12:40.867 --> 12:44.133
that you're technically
part of our family.

12:44.133 --> 12:45.867
(Candace)
Brooke, darling, stop pushing.

12:45.867 --> 12:48.367
You're an Olympic skier.
[chuckles]

12:48.367 --> 12:49.933
Jill's people
aren't exactly known

12:49.933 --> 12:51.467
for their athletic prowess.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.533
Mother.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.167
Well, she can't
just decide

12:54.167 --> 12:56.100
to start moving
her body one day.

12:56.100 --> 13:00.200
[laughing]
That would be like a panda
deciding to speed-skate.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.100
That would be adorable!

13:02.100 --> 13:04.100
I can move my body.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.533
I'm not a panda.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.833
Of course.

13:06.833 --> 13:09.667
I just don't want anything
to go badly.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.400
I appreciate
your concern, Candace,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.900
but my "thass" and I
will be there.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.833
Quick medical question.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.800
Am I at risk
for cardiac arrest

13:19.800 --> 13:21.200
if I do Soul Wheelz

13:21.200 --> 13:23.700
in my current state
of non-fitness?

13:23.700 --> 13:26.700
Wait. Are you actually doing
that stupid NYACHO thing?

13:26.700 --> 13:29.600
Yes, those blonde bitches
think I'm gonna break my ass.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.300
What choice do I have?

13:31.300 --> 13:34.333
Okay, I feel it's my
responsibility to remind you

13:34.333 --> 13:37.567
of your step-aerobics moment,
junior year.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.267
It was a mild sprain,

13:39.267 --> 13:41.467
and that teacher
wasn't even certified.

13:41.467 --> 13:42.700
Fine, go.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.533
But you have to send me pictures
of you in spandex.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.267
It can be
my early birthday present.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.333
Done.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.933
Okay got to run.
I'm carbo-loading.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.233
Honey,
it's not a marathon.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.900
It's 40 minutes
on a hamster wheel.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.667
You're right.
How hard could it be?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.233
Plus, it's for a bad cause.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.500
[laughs]

13:57.500 --> 13:59.133
[phone ringing]

13:59.133 --> 14:00.333
(Paul)
Hey!

14:00.333 --> 14:02.767
I understand
congratulations are in order.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.200
Thanks, Paul.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.600
We are all very happy
for my brother's bank account.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.933
No, I meant you.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.300
You're a partner now.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.567
Come on, top of the heap.

14:10.567 --> 14:11.700
Living large.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.700
What, did you forget?

14:12.700 --> 14:14.800
Almost, actually.
Thanks.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.067
It's quite
the club we're in.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.367
115 of us partners

14:18.367 --> 14:20.167
get to work
ten times as hard

14:20.167 --> 14:22.433
just so the firm keeps
most of our salary.

14:22.433 --> 14:23.800
You mean the buy-in.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.233
It's that bad?

14:25.233 --> 14:28.233
Oh, they didn't tell you
about that yet.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.633
It's $750K for overhead,

14:30.633 --> 14:32.933
plus another 50 grand
every year

14:32.933 --> 14:34.367
towards the employee
health fund.

14:34.367 --> 14:36.733
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.733
You can either pay it
up front--ha ha--

14:38.733 --> 14:40.967
Or divvy it up
over a few years.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.367
I've been a partner
ten years now.

14:42.367 --> 14:46.067
So I only got another,
what, 16 years

14:46.067 --> 14:48.233
before I'm
out of the hole.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.167
Yeah, it's totally
worth it.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.333
Hi.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.933
Jill, you made it.

15:17.933 --> 15:19.600
What is this, a unicorn?

15:19.600 --> 15:21.800
Is that--is that
a child's shirt?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.200
No, it's mine.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.133
I don't have all
the, like, gear stuff, so...

15:26.133 --> 15:27.133
Jill!

15:27.133 --> 15:28.233
Welcome.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.767
I moved mountains
to be here.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.233
I have you at bike four.

15:31.233 --> 15:35.500
Actually, 44, in the back,
very back row.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.900
Mrs. Hardwick, hi.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.500
Jill Weber,
Dottie and Miles' mom.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.767
I just want to tell you,

15:40.767 --> 15:42.933
we are on the wait list
for Suzuki violin.

15:42.933 --> 15:44.900
- Martha.
- Ashley, hi!

15:44.900 --> 15:46.233
- What happened?
- I know, I know.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.433
That's why I sent you
that message.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.267
Okay.

15:51.267 --> 15:52.733
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

15:52.733 --> 15:54.067
Wow.
Look at this turnout, huh?

15:54.067 --> 15:55.233
I'm so proud of you.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.333
Where's your spin outfit?

15:56.333 --> 15:57.533
I laid it out
on the bed for you.

15:57.533 --> 15:58.733
Oh, no, I couldn't.

15:58.733 --> 16:00.967
I just came for
the photo-op, right?

16:00.967 --> 16:02.533
I have to be at the club
in half an hour.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.100
Actually,
in 23 minutes.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.067
Sorry to butt in.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.700
One thing
that I asked of you.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.800
Hey, do you want Ella
to stay and bike?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.667
I don't need her
after this, huh?

16:10.667 --> 16:12.267
Why would I want
your assistant here?

16:12.267 --> 16:14.300
You can't just throw her
at every problem.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.133
Hey, everybody, let's give
a round of applause

16:17.133 --> 16:19.133
for my beautiful wife,
Brooke, huh?

16:19.133 --> 16:20.900
Who made all this happen.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.433
[applause]

16:22.433 --> 16:24.133
All right!

16:24.133 --> 16:26.200
[applause continues]

16:26.200 --> 16:28.500
Hey, sweetheart,
how you doing, Jill?

16:28.500 --> 16:30.900
Yeah, you guys have fun,
and NACHO, huh?

16:30.900 --> 16:32.100
[applause]

16:32.100 --> 16:33.967
[clears throat]

16:33.967 --> 16:37.467
There is a plague upon us.

16:37.467 --> 16:40.900
Childhood obesity
is a scourge

16:40.900 --> 16:43.067
affecting millions
of children

16:43.067 --> 16:44.567
in this country,

16:44.567 --> 16:46.333
like little Augustus here.

16:46.333 --> 16:50.733
Augustus,
come on up here.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.967
Your financial support
will help children

16:53.967 --> 16:58.300
by introducing prophylactic
gastric bypasses

16:58.300 --> 17:03.567
for at-risk kids
with morbidly obese parents.

17:03.567 --> 17:04.833
Thank you, Augustus,

17:04.833 --> 17:10.167
for being the brave face
of this hideous disease.

17:10.167 --> 17:13.733
[applause]

17:13.733 --> 17:14.933
Hey, are you okay?

17:14.933 --> 17:16.233
That was kind of harsh.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.433
I don't give a [bleep].

17:17.433 --> 17:20.233
I get 500 bucks
for these dog-and-pony shows.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.567
Not bad.

17:21.567 --> 17:25.433
Now, let's give it up
for the soul of Soul Wheelz,

17:25.433 --> 17:27.300
the one and only Nikki B!

17:27.300 --> 17:29.300
[cheers and applause]

17:29.300 --> 17:32.300
[upbeat music]

17:32.300 --> 17:33.333
* *

17:33.333 --> 17:35.500
Ah!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.700
Are you bitches
ready to sweat?

17:37.700 --> 17:39.900
[cheers and applause]

17:41.133 --> 17:43.733
Jack up that resistance.

17:43.733 --> 17:44.833
Come on.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.067
Only one of you
can be the leader

17:47.067 --> 17:49.533
up on that board today.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.633
Who's it gonna be?

17:51.633 --> 17:53.067
And here we go.

17:53.067 --> 17:57.067
Right, left,
right, left.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.600
Bike 44,

17:58.600 --> 18:01.333
what's happening
over there, unicorn?

18:01.333 --> 18:03.633
Are you with us?

18:03.633 --> 18:05.067
Turn your resistance down

18:05.067 --> 18:08.400
in three, two, one.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.667
Whoa!

18:09.667 --> 18:11.233
Hey, yeah!

18:11.233 --> 18:14.500
You got to move out
of your comfort zone, people.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.100
Right, left, left, right,
left, right, left--

18:17.100 --> 18:18.933
Keep up, unicorn!

18:18.933 --> 18:20.800
(all)
What's down there?
What's up there?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.967
What's down there?
What's up there?

18:22.967 --> 18:26.067
(Nikki B)
I see who my leaders are.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.067
Unicorn, pick the pace up.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.133
Are you bitches
gonna sit back

18:30.133 --> 18:33.300
and let the pregnant lady
on bike 13 steal the title?

18:33.300 --> 18:35.633
Come on!

18:35.633 --> 18:38.200
Unicorn, do you want
to be the leader,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.200
or do you want to be
one of the pack?

18:44.433 --> 18:48.300
There you go, better.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.800
That's it.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.833
- Clap-clap, clap-clap.
[rhythmic clapping]

18:51.833 --> 18:54.633
(Nikki B)
Nice.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.200
Stay with it, unicorn!

18:56.200 --> 18:57.533
Stay with it!

18:57.533 --> 19:00.100
Come on!

19:00.100 --> 19:01.733
Am I seeing right?

19:01.733 --> 19:04.333
The unicorn
has taken the lead!

19:04.333 --> 19:06.500
Let's here it for unicorn!

19:06.500 --> 19:08.067
Un-i-corn!

19:08.067 --> 19:10.900
[all chanting, "Unicorn!"]

19:10.900 --> 19:14.067
(Nikki B)
Unicorn is our leader!

19:14.067 --> 19:15.600
Left, right, left, right,
left, right,

19:15.600 --> 19:18.067
left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right!

19:18.067 --> 19:20.133
You got to move through
your comfort zone!

19:20.133 --> 19:22.667
You're gonna be dead
in 90 years!

19:22.667 --> 19:23.767
[door opens]

19:23.767 --> 19:25.600
Ooh, Daddy's home!

19:25.600 --> 19:28.300
Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

19:28.300 --> 19:29.867
Hey, guys, hey.

19:29.867 --> 19:30.967
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

19:30.967 --> 19:32.633
Hi.
What's wrong?

19:32.633 --> 19:35.067
You didn't make
$675 million today?

19:35.067 --> 19:36.300
No, I did not,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.800
but I did
bring home tacos.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.100
Even better!

19:40.100 --> 19:41.233
Whoo!

19:41.233 --> 19:42.967
I have an announcement
to make.

19:42.967 --> 19:43.967
Yeah?

19:43.967 --> 19:45.900
I love exercise now!

19:45.900 --> 19:47.300
I was hyperventilating.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.533
I thought
I was gonna die.

19:48.533 --> 19:50.667
And then I staggered home,
and I took a shower,

19:50.667 --> 19:52.500
and it was like
the clouds parted

19:52.500 --> 19:54.100
and the angels sang.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.667
* Ah ah ah ah *

19:56.667 --> 19:59.800
* Amen *

19:59.800 --> 20:01.200
And I not only survived,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.533
I was the leader...

20:02.533 --> 20:05.633
for 7 seconds,
but still.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.500
What's wrong?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.300
We have to come up with about
a million bucks for the firm.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.533
It's called a buy-in.

20:12.533 --> 20:14.233
So you got a million bucks
sitting around?

20:14.233 --> 20:16.067
'Cause I don't.

20:16.067 --> 20:18.900
Okay, that is sucky enough
to kill my buzz.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.900
But I say let's freak out
about it tomorrow.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.100
And I want to show you
the photos I took

20:24.100 --> 20:26.000
for the kindergarten
applications.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.200
Okay, what do you think?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.567
Do these look like the future
leaders of tomorrow?

20:29.567 --> 20:31.200
Supreme Court justices?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.367
Pop stars?

20:32.367 --> 20:33.833
People who blog
about pop stars?

20:33.833 --> 20:36.133
(Andy)
Dentists, maybe.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.533
I have an idea.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.667
Underwear dance par-tay!

20:39.667 --> 20:42.667
[joyous music]

20:42.667 --> 20:43.967
* *

20:43.967 --> 20:46.133
Come on, Miles, get down!

20:46.133 --> 20:52.567
* *

20:52.567 --> 20:54.067
Holy Toledo.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.033
(Jill)
Ow, ow, agony.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.133
Ow!
Oh, my God!

20:59.133 --> 21:01.633
Ow, ow!
[grunts]

21:01.633 --> 21:04.600
[cell phone ringing]

21:06.700 --> 21:07.667
Hey, Jill.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.067
I'm stuck
on the [bleep].

21:09.067 --> 21:11.067
[laughing]

21:11.067 --> 21:12.133
Oh, babe.

21:12.133 --> 21:13.267
I can't get up.

21:13.267 --> 21:15.133
Why did you let me
do that?

21:15.133 --> 21:16.833
I tried to warn you.

21:16.833 --> 21:17.867
Ow!

21:17.867 --> 21:19.867
The second day is worse.

21:19.867 --> 21:22.267
I hate exercise!

21:22.267 --> 21:25.067
(Jill)

21:26.433 --> 21:27.833

Oh, dear.
