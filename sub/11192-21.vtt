WEBVTT

00:21.800 --> 00:24.966
- Got a minute, sir?
- Come on in, Jack. Have a seat.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.771
I never anticipated how much paperwork
is involved in shutting down a facility.

00:32.759 --> 00:37.497
Not exactly the last brave act
I wanted to do before retiring.

00:37.558 --> 00:40.639
So, you're still just
gonna throw it in, huh?

00:40.677 --> 00:44.707
I was a month away from retirement
before we started the SGC.

00:44.759 --> 00:47.798
The only thing that kept me here was...

00:47.837 --> 00:50.128
Well, it was a pretty wild ride.

00:50.158 --> 00:54.500
Yes, sir. Personally, I don't think we
should be getting off that ride just yet.

00:54.557 --> 00:57.914
Colonel, we've been through this.
I agree. But we have our orders.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.576
Ill-conceived orders.

00:59.597 --> 01:03.506
I agree. But they're orders just the same,
and I, for one, follow them.

01:03.557 --> 01:08.218
Even though we are the only line
of defence protecting this planet.

01:10.277 --> 01:12.981
- I know that.
- I know you know that, sir.

01:14.995 --> 01:17.486
You're still just gonna chuck it?

01:18.756 --> 01:22.429
You don't think I tried everything
to prevent this shutdown?

01:22.475 --> 01:26.938
I went back to Senator Kinsey twice. The
second time he had me forcibly removed.

01:26.995 --> 01:29.719
I went to the secretary of defence.

01:29.756 --> 01:34.020
- Hell, I finally called the president.
- What did he say?

01:34.073 --> 01:39.862
That to override the Senate committee
on this would be political suicide for him.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.486
It's over, Jack.

01:43.513 --> 01:46.870
No extensions, no reversals,
no new hearings.

01:46.914 --> 01:51.076
The Stargate will be buried,
literally and figuratively.

02:07.391 --> 02:11.804
Hammond's given up. They're gonna
bury the gate day after tomorrow.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.992
Then I must return through the gate
as soon as possible.

02:19.030 --> 02:21.635
I guess we all should go through
as soon as possible.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.908
- Whoa. To where?
- The coordinates I got in the other reality.

02:24.949 --> 02:28.385
- Daniel, dammit.
- Jack, it was real.

02:28.430 --> 02:32.537
Even if it was, how do we know that
that address correlates with this reality?

02:32.590 --> 02:34.247
There's only one way to find out.

02:34.268 --> 02:38.182
We should enter the coordinates
and attempt to open the gate.

02:39.867 --> 02:41.921
OK, hold on.

02:41.949 --> 02:45.858
Has anyone considered that we would
be in gross violation of orders?

02:45.908 --> 02:48.593
We would be court-martialled
the second we got back.

02:48.628 --> 02:51.550
If. If we got back.

02:51.586 --> 02:54.747
If we don't go through,
what I saw there could happen here.

02:54.788 --> 02:57.658
This whole planet could be wiped out.

03:00.788 --> 03:03.947
In the other reality,
by the time I left, Sara was dead.

03:03.986 --> 03:06.079
Carter, your family was dead. I was dead.

03:06.106 --> 03:08.237
- Everyone was dead.
- Daniel, I got it!

03:08.265 --> 03:13.853
Don't you think we should see if we can
stop the slaughter from happening here?

03:15.146 --> 03:16.639
Let me ask you something.

03:16.665 --> 03:22.004
If we don't go through now and the
Goa'uld do attack later, how will you feel?

03:23.025 --> 03:26.539
How can just the four of us stop
the attack even if we do go through?

03:26.585 --> 03:30.849
We'd have a better chance now than we
would trying to stop an onslaught later.

03:30.905 --> 03:32.840
Trust me, I have seen it.

03:32.865 --> 03:36.932
If the coordinates are for a Goa'uld world
which is not on the Abydos cartouche,

03:36.984 --> 03:40.341
the Goa'uld will most likely not expect us.

03:40.384 --> 03:45.281
<i>- A medical attack could be successful.
- Surgical attack, Teal'c.</i>

03:45.343 --> 03:49.016
It's called a surgical attack,
and I'd feel like an idiot.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.850
- Sir?
- I was answering Daniel's question.

03:53.502 --> 03:58.413
If we don't do something now and
they do attack later, I'd feel like an idiot.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.616
We go.

04:11.262 --> 04:13.752
I, too, will go.

04:19.420 --> 04:22.500
- It's not an order, Captain.
- I understand that, Colonel.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.074
Thank you. I'm going.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.968
<i>Attention, all personnel.
Unauthorised Stargate activation.</i>

04:33.019 --> 04:36.731
Carter, close the blast doors
and corridors. Disable them.

04:36.778 --> 04:40.411
I need an authorised officer's
security code to disable them.

04:40.459 --> 04:42.534
There you go.

04:49.177 --> 04:52.012
Go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

05:03.538 --> 05:07.406
- It's on security lockout, sir.
- Get it open, Major. Now.

05:07.456 --> 05:11.951
- Try going around through corridor C.
- Yes, sir. Move on. Corridor C.

05:13.055 --> 05:15.149
Right, the MALP's on its way.

05:15.175 --> 05:19.089
Should reach its destination
in three... two... one.

05:23.935 --> 05:27.370
- Did we lose the signal?
- No, sir. We are receiving video.

05:27.415 --> 05:30.997
Point of arrival is dark.
Switching to infrared.

05:36.454 --> 05:39.454
- Looks ancient Egyptian.
- Possible Goa'uld.

05:41.494 --> 05:44.968
<i>- No signs of life nearby.
- Security breached.</i>

05:45.012 --> 05:48.298
- They just got corridor C-9 open.
- Right, let's go.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.957
Daniel, send back the MALP.

07:47.322 --> 07:50.245
Doesn't look like
there are any doors or windows.

07:50.283 --> 07:54.779
Many Goa'uld facilities
disguise doorways within their structure.

08:00.843 --> 08:03.408
Teal'c, what are these things?

08:03.442 --> 08:06.482
Transport containers.
Much like your shipping crates.

08:06.521 --> 08:10.269
- So they're shipping something through?
- Or receiving.

08:11.321 --> 08:13.728
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

08:35.359 --> 08:38.230
Cool. What are these things?

08:44.038 --> 08:47.870
This is a Goa'uld zat'n'ktel, a weapon
using a different form of energy,

08:47.918 --> 08:53.485
less powerful than that of a staff weapon.
Less destructive, but still quite deadly.

08:53.557 --> 08:56.345
Sweet. Pass 'em out.

08:57.517 --> 09:00.479
- What'd you call it?
- Zat'n'ktel.

09:00.517 --> 09:03.433
Right. Let's call it a zat gun, huh?

09:06.076 --> 09:09.610
- How do you fire it?
- One need only squeeze it here to fire.

09:13.116 --> 09:16.749
The Goa'uld take pleasure in firing
the weapon only once on a subject,

09:16.796 --> 09:20.389
causing him great pain,
disabling him but not killing him.

09:20.436 --> 09:24.054
- A second shot will kill most subjects.
- Nice.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.288
What the hell's that?

09:28.315 --> 09:31.101
- What's happening, Teal'c?
- I am not sure.

09:43.634 --> 09:47.335
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah. What was that?

09:48.553 --> 09:51.634
It was like some kind
of weird planetary shift.

09:51.673 --> 09:54.923
- We should dial home immediately.
- Do it, Daniel.

10:06.111 --> 10:07.107
Daniel?

10:07.152 --> 10:10.390
What? I dialled home just like
I have a million times before.

10:10.432 --> 10:12.508
Well, do it again.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.586
Uh-oh.

11:45.623 --> 11:49.370
I always get a happy, tingly feeling
when I see those guys.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.379
Teal'c, what is this?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.732
It is a Goa'uld long-range
visual communication device.

12:14.780 --> 12:19.125
Somewhat like your television,
only much further advanced.

12:19.181 --> 12:21.470
<i>Think it gets Showtime?</i>

12:24.740 --> 12:28.951
- Can you open that door?
- Now I know its location, I believe I can.

13:28.455 --> 13:30.547
Sir, we've confirmed it was SG-1.

13:30.573 --> 13:34.682
They went to the coordinates Dr. Jackson
brought back from that... other place.

13:34.735 --> 13:38.880
If what he saw was real it's the origination
point of the Goa'uld attack on Earth.

13:38.933 --> 13:43.181
- Pretty hostile place to go.
- Do you want SG-2 to go get them?

13:44.734 --> 13:47.932
You'd only be bringing them back
for courts martial.

13:47.972 --> 13:50.341
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Go ahead.

13:50.373 --> 13:53.808
Sir, Colonel O'Neill saved my butt.
I'd like to go in and back him up.

13:53.852 --> 13:57.980
- I can't send your unit in.
- My men and I are willing to take the risk.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.089
I'll take that under advisement, Major.

14:55.248 --> 14:57.260
A sarcophagus.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.991
Oh, great. More snake heads.

15:01.648 --> 15:04.019
Teal'c, any idea which one's in here?

15:06.285 --> 15:08.244
Teal'c?

15:09.285 --> 15:13.414
<i>- We're not on a planet, are we?
- That is correct.</i>

15:14.686 --> 15:17.884
It appears we are aboard
a Goa'uld transport vessel.

15:17.926 --> 15:21.092
- And that jolt was...
- A hyper launch.

15:36.284 --> 15:38.989
<i>Chevron four encoded.</i>

15:39.724 --> 15:42.764
You'll proceed much like SG-1 did.
We'll send the MALP first.

15:42.803 --> 15:44.897
- If it's clear you'll go through.
- Yes.

15:44.924 --> 15:50.413
Officially, your primary mission
is to bring back SG-1 for court martial.

15:50.484 --> 15:52.299
Yes, sir.

15:52.323 --> 15:54.809
Major, bring them back alive and well.

15:54.841 --> 15:58.376
<i>- That's my plan, sir.
- Chevron seven.</i>

16:02.763 --> 16:06.355
- Will not lock.
- What happened, Sergeant?

16:06.402 --> 16:10.150
<i>- I'm sorry, sir. I don't know.
- Well, find out.</i>

16:16.759 --> 16:20.094
Teal'c, why didn't you tell us
we were on a ship?

16:21.240 --> 16:25.940
I was not sure. I have never been
aboard a Goa'uld vessel such as this.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.668
Most accelerate very differently.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.063
Most do not contain Stargates.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.221
- Tel kol nok!
- Hey!

16:39.678 --> 16:41.802
How you doin'?

16:43.318 --> 16:44.895
Uh...

16:45.479 --> 16:47.684
seen a bathroom around here?

17:09.276 --> 17:13.305
OK... One shot hurts him.
Two shots kill him.

17:13.356 --> 17:16.079
- The third shot...
- Disintegrates him.

17:16.115 --> 17:20.326
Oh, great. You didn't feel this
was worthy of mention, I take it?

17:23.954 --> 17:27.943
The blast spread across this area
like there was glass here.

17:27.993 --> 17:30.915
<i>- This is a force field of some sort.
- Correct.</i>

17:30.953 --> 17:33.955
No transparent material
could withstand this velocity.

17:33.994 --> 17:38.338
Or temporal displacement.
We're travelling faster than light, right?

17:38.394 --> 17:40.249
That is correct.

17:40.273 --> 17:43.749
The ship must have been in orbit
around a planet when we gated here.

17:43.792 --> 17:47.822
Then it launched or left orbit, which
would explain why we can't gate home.

17:47.874 --> 17:50.991
- The point of origin isn't valid any more.
- Right.

17:51.031 --> 17:54.112
I suggest the two of you figure out
how to get us back home.

17:54.152 --> 17:57.587
The only way to do that
would be to go back to where we started.

17:57.632 --> 18:00.751
Right, I'll just go tell the pilot.

18:00.791 --> 18:04.701
Teal'c, do you know how to fly
one of these things?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.912
Of this I am unsure. It appears
to be of a new technology.

18:07.951 --> 18:10.635
So, you couldn't turn this tub around?

18:10.671 --> 18:14.371
I am qualified only to pilot
the Goa'uld death gliders.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.469
I suggest we relocate to another chamber
as soon as possible.

18:21.510 --> 18:25.295
The royal sarcophagi
are rarely left unattended for long.

19:16.705 --> 19:18.615
Jack?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.618
It's happening.

19:27.305 --> 19:30.464
We're on an attack ship headed to Earth.

19:30.506 --> 19:32.083
OK.

19:32.104 --> 19:36.093
- We've got some problems, then.
- Teal'c, how fast can this ship go?

19:36.144 --> 19:39.619
A Goa'uld Ha'tak vessel travels
at ten times the speed of light.

19:39.664 --> 19:43.614
So, if we are heading to Earth,
then we have a long time.

19:43.664 --> 19:47.179
- Based on what?
- Coordinates of the planet we gated to.

19:47.223 --> 19:49.157
We gated to a ship.

19:49.182 --> 19:54.239
But that ship had to be in orbit around
or on a planet for the coordinates to work.

19:54.304 --> 19:58.607
So, even if we were travelling
at ten times the speed of light,

19:58.663 --> 20:02.217
it would take at least a year
to get to Earth, probably more.

20:02.261 --> 20:06.971
<i>Mol Jaffa! Tim lokeem rel molcon ai.</i>

20:09.820 --> 20:12.856
They're being summoned
to some sort of gathering.

20:26.299 --> 20:28.375
OK. Let's go.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.193
Wait a minute. Go where?

20:32.220 --> 20:34.592
Wherever they're going.

21:24.536 --> 21:27.074
<i>Chel hol, Jaffa.</i>

21:29.733 --> 21:33.644
The end of a dark moment
in Goa'uld history approaches.

21:33.693 --> 21:37.739
Soon we will wipe out
the scourge that plagues us.

21:38.454 --> 21:41.409
I will rejoin you
as we come out of the shadows.

21:43.253 --> 21:49.256
Until then, you are to follow all orders
of my son as if they were my own.

21:55.893 --> 21:58.143
Bow down now.

21:58.172 --> 22:01.088
Show me your reverence for my son.

22:04.811 --> 22:07.517
The mighty warrior, Klorel.

22:08.971 --> 22:11.640
<i>Tel kol, Jaffa.</i>

22:20.289 --> 22:22.663
<i>Kel Apophis.</i>

22:23.890 --> 22:25.883
Re nek...

22:26.529 --> 22:28.653
Klorel.

22:29.730 --> 22:32.434
Re nek, Klorel.

22:53.169 --> 22:56.049
He called him his son. That's sick.

22:56.086 --> 22:58.258
Not exactly a chip off the old block.

22:58.287 --> 23:01.250
The Goa'uld in Skaara may be
the son of the one in Apophis.

23:01.288 --> 23:03.538
Thank you. That's encouraging.

23:03.567 --> 23:05.621
I'm just trying to help.

23:05.647 --> 23:07.701
What is our plan of attack?

23:07.728 --> 23:11.795
We're gonna split up.
Carter, Daniel, plant C4 all over this ship.

23:11.846 --> 23:14.530
What are you and Teal'c gonna do?

23:14.566 --> 23:16.817
We're gonna try and grab Skaara.

23:16.846 --> 23:20.440
Sir, are you sure? It would be
like trying to take Apophis.

23:20.486 --> 23:24.157
They do not know we're aboard.
There is little reason to guard him heavily.

23:24.204 --> 23:28.430
OK, but with respect, sir, I think
you're making an emotional decision.

23:28.483 --> 23:29.978
Maybe.

23:30.005 --> 23:33.163
<i>- But it's also the best strategic decision.
- Is it?</i>

23:33.204 --> 23:37.114
Jack has a point. If we capture him maybe
we can get through to the old Skaara.

23:37.163 --> 23:41.789
Kendra said she could fight past her
Goa'uld when it was still inside of her.

23:42.523 --> 23:45.644
- Let's go.
- Sir. Contingency plan?

23:48.123 --> 23:50.199
C4.

24:43.118 --> 24:46.903
<i>- Chel nok, makor.
- Rin nok.</i>

24:48.799 --> 24:54.249
You dare to do this to Klorel?
You will die a painful death.

24:54.317 --> 24:55.811
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

24:55.837 --> 25:01.211
There's a raised hieroglyphic on the wall.
It resembles a coiled serpent. Turn it.

25:07.438 --> 25:10.106
<i>Stand aside.</i>

25:26.315 --> 25:29.814
They will not be able to access
this room for some time.

25:34.194 --> 25:36.270
Hey, Skaara.

25:37.513 --> 25:39.802
Long time no see.

26:07.672 --> 26:09.166
All right.

26:09.192 --> 26:13.576
Those things have to be fuelled by
something, and fuel is combustible, so...

26:13.632 --> 26:18.606
So, if we blow up one,
we'll probably start a chain reaction.

26:18.670 --> 26:20.746
Right.

26:41.588 --> 26:44.210
Come on, Skaara. Think.

26:45.587 --> 26:49.615
Try to remember me.
I'm Jack O'Neill. This is Teal'c.

26:49.667 --> 26:54.367
<i>Ah, Teal'c, the traitor.
I'll enjoy delivering his head to my father.</i>

26:54.427 --> 26:57.586
- He's not your father!
- He is my father.

26:57.627 --> 26:59.957
He seeded the queen mother.

26:59.987 --> 27:04.980
He chose the host in which I will
live out eternity. Apophis gave me life.

27:05.347 --> 27:08.468
I'm not talking to that thing in your head.

27:08.906 --> 27:11.789
I'm talking to Skaara.

27:11.826 --> 27:15.575
- Nothing of the host survives.
- That's bullshit.

27:17.746 --> 27:20.451
Now let him talk to me.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.590
Your friend had a feeble mind.

27:23.625 --> 27:27.076
It suffered greatly and gave in easily.

27:40.384 --> 27:43.267
Come on, Skaara. Look at me.

27:43.304 --> 27:44.632
Try.

27:47.502 --> 27:50.623
Perhaps I will not kill you.

27:50.663 --> 27:53.822
Perhaps you will make
a good host yourself.

27:53.863 --> 27:56.390
All right, promise me
this thing won't kill him.

27:56.423 --> 27:59.186
Two shots will. One will
only cause him great pain.

27:59.221 --> 28:01.630
So, here's the deal.

28:01.662 --> 28:05.612
Let him out, let him talk to me,
or you get the whole load.

28:05.662 --> 28:08.366
You will only hurt your friend.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.232
He's a tough kid.

28:11.261 --> 28:16.079
Your friend is too afraid to come forward.
He enjoys my protection.

28:16.142 --> 28:19.694
He really does not wish to speak with you.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.816
Is that right?

28:22.820 --> 28:24.951
Let him go, Teal'c.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.103
Let him go.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.016
Sha're! Dan'yer!

28:37.339 --> 28:39.628
Skaara?

28:40.298 --> 28:42.392
Are you there?

28:42.420 --> 28:44.827
O'Neill!

28:44.858 --> 28:46.557
It hurts.

28:46.578 --> 28:48.819
I know, kid. I'm sorry.

28:49.898 --> 28:52.141
O'Neill, are you still my friend?

28:55.018 --> 28:57.544
Yes, I am.

28:57.576 --> 29:02.867
Can you forgive me
for what we are about to do?

29:04.695 --> 29:07.144
<i>What are you about to do?</i>

29:07.176 --> 29:10.261
Skaara! Skaara,
what are you about to do?

29:11.336 --> 29:14.970
- Please forgive us.
- Hang in there, kid. Come on. Hang on.

29:15.016 --> 29:18.219
- What are you about to do?
- Jaffa, nok kree tol!

29:23.096 --> 29:25.468
Drop the weapon.

29:26.855 --> 29:28.931
Release Klorel... now.

29:38.815 --> 29:41.353
Come on, Skaara. Help us.

29:47.094 --> 29:49.107
Release him.

29:49.134 --> 29:51.589
Or we will kill the human.

29:52.452 --> 29:55.098
If you kill the human, I will kill Klorel.

29:55.133 --> 29:58.086
And the host in which he resides?

30:24.650 --> 30:26.726
Jaffa, nok!

30:28.730 --> 30:31.767
<i>The traitor and his recruiter.</i>

30:33.608 --> 30:36.563
My father will be pleased.

30:38.929 --> 30:42.522
The naqahdah in the gate
will magnify the explosion.

30:42.568 --> 30:46.186
I'm just hoping they can't
see us through this thing.

31:10.487 --> 31:13.192
<i>Shin tel, Klorel?</i>

31:14.047 --> 31:19.041
Father, I wish to present you
with a great gift.

31:19.685 --> 31:22.355
The traitor, Teal'c.

31:24.204 --> 31:28.617
And I present...
the human that recruited him.

31:32.204 --> 31:33.948
- Hey, Pops.
- Silence!

31:36.204 --> 31:38.890
- Klorel, where did they come from?
- We don't know.

31:38.924 --> 31:42.715
- We found them after departure.
- How many more came with you?

31:42.765 --> 31:46.215
Thousands. We brought our whole army.

31:47.045 --> 31:49.796
I assure you, Father,
there could be no more.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.961
You have made me proud, my son.

31:55.683 --> 31:58.327
Do you wish that I keep them
until our rejoining?

31:58.362 --> 32:03.272
No. Teal'c must suffer the most
painful death a Jaffa can know.

32:05.083 --> 32:08.037
Removal of his Prim'ta.

32:08.682 --> 32:11.920
Let his new master
watch him suffer and die.

32:11.961 --> 32:15.396
- What about the human?
- You may choose his method of death.

32:15.441 --> 32:18.692
But do it soon. It is almost time for remoc.

32:19.961 --> 32:21.617
Yes, Father.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.759
I look forward to seeing you
at our destination.

32:25.799 --> 32:27.875
Lek tol.

32:48.318 --> 32:50.528
Skaara.

32:50.557 --> 32:53.262
Don't let this happen.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.791
Don't let 'em do this.

33:10.435 --> 33:12.643
Na-nay!

33:14.797 --> 33:17.750
Take them to the peltak.

33:39.913 --> 33:43.113
<i>OK, Daniel. We're gonna go after them.</i>

33:43.153 --> 33:48.314
- Wait. When do we blow the ship?
- We'll detonate only as a last resort.

33:49.234 --> 33:53.026
I want to save them, but if we get
captured or killed, there'll be nobody left

33:53.074 --> 33:56.587
- To blow this ship before it gets to Earth.
- I'm setting a timer.

33:56.633 --> 34:01.294
If we don't deactivate it in 24 hours,
it'll go automatically. OK?

34:08.431 --> 34:09.463
OK.

34:26.670 --> 34:29.505
You wish to go home to your planet?

34:30.510 --> 34:32.585
Of course.

34:33.391 --> 34:36.177
Jaffa, rel toc remoc.

34:40.668 --> 34:42.744
O'Neill, prepare yourself for...

34:43.670 --> 34:45.128
Ow!

34:45.150 --> 34:47.795
...extreme deceleration.

34:47.829 --> 34:50.367
Thanks, Teal'c.

34:58.307 --> 35:00.384
Oh, my God.

35:05.907 --> 35:09.027
You will get to see your home
one last time

35:10.067 --> 35:15.309
before you and everyone
on your planet are destroyed

35:16.586 --> 35:21.130
and your kind will disturb
the Goa'uld no more.

35:34.905 --> 35:37.708
Sir, I think we have another situation.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.509
We just spoke with
Cairn deep-space radar.

35:40.543 --> 35:44.255
It picked up two large blips passing
Saturn. They're heading to Earth.

35:44.302 --> 35:46.713
- Any identification?
- Not yet, sir.

35:46.744 --> 35:51.204
NASA's repositioning Hubble right now.
Then we can get a closer look.

35:52.344 --> 35:56.530
- I guess Dr. Jackson is lucky.
- How so, sir?

35:56.583 --> 36:01.826
He won't have to be around to watch his
nightmare come true for a second time.

36:05.981 --> 36:10.728
This is Major General Hammond.
Let me speak to the president.

37:14.615 --> 37:18.644
The president is mobilising every branch,
including the guard and reserve.

37:18.697 --> 37:22.052
The air force efforts will be
coordinated through this facility.

37:22.094 --> 37:26.480
I need this room converted
to a command-and-control centre ASAP.

37:26.536 --> 37:30.760
Make sure we have a link to AF Satcom
for encrypted communications

37:30.815 --> 37:33.737
to all air-force bases and to NASA.

37:33.775 --> 37:37.273
- Any more details on what we're facing?
- Not yet, sir.

38:54.807 --> 38:56.302
Skaara!

39:03.447 --> 39:05.155
Skaara, don't!

39:08.206 --> 39:10.413
O'Neill! You must take action!

39:15.327 --> 39:17.402
Skaara!

39:32.925 --> 39:34.583
Daniel?

39:34.605 --> 39:36.681
You OK?

39:39.123 --> 39:40.748
O'Neill...

39:41.884 --> 39:44.173
Ah, Skaara.

39:44.204 --> 39:46.612
I'm sorry.

40:01.242 --> 40:02.940
Colonel O'Neill.

40:02.961 --> 40:05.371
Yeah, give me a second here.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.775
I cannot.

40:18.561 --> 40:19.842
Earth.

40:26.041 --> 40:29.318
I thought you said we couldn't
be there for at least a year.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.152
<i>I guess this ship can go way
faster than ten times the speed of light.</i>

40:35.159 --> 40:38.030
Colonel, we saw the death gliders.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.353
They're prepping for launch, sir.
