WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:15.206 --> 00:16.379
<i>All right players!</i>

00:16.379 --> 00:18.793
It's your last chance
to cross the snake pit-

00:18.793 --> 00:20.551
and rack up
those points!

00:20.551 --> 00:22.586
<i>This round is
coming to a close!</i>

00:24.724 --> 00:25.655
Action card.

00:25.655 --> 00:27.482
Now, do I risk going
over the bridge?

00:27.482 --> 00:28.931
Or do I cross
through the jungle?

00:28.931 --> 00:30.586
Fortune favours
the brave Jesse.

00:30.586 --> 00:31.448
Well maybe.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.551
But Snakepit favours
the cutthroat.

00:33.551 --> 00:34.551
One push from me-

00:34.896 --> 00:36.482
<i>and you're heading
into that pit-</i>

00:36.482 --> 00:37.965
and out of the
race for the 100K.

00:38.344 --> 00:39.137
Okay.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.206
<i>Don't worry
about it, Raya!</i>

00:42.206 --> 00:43.896
We've got
a hit game!

00:43.896 --> 00:45.896
Over a thousand people
signed up to play-

00:45.896 --> 00:47.275
in today's anniversary tournament.

00:47.275 --> 00:48.241
And that's great.

00:48.241 --> 00:50.068
But where does Cottage
Games go from here?

00:50.068 --> 00:50.827
Maybe we should consider-

00:50.827 --> 00:52.068
We've talked about this!

00:52.068 --> 00:54.000
We're going to merchandise
the hell out of Snakepit!

00:54.000 --> 00:54.793
And what about-?

00:54.793 --> 00:55.620
<i>The next game?</i>

00:55.620 --> 00:56.379
Mm-hmm.

00:56.379 --> 00:57.551
You'll come up
with something!

00:58.241 --> 01:00.000
Snakepit sales will
fund your R&D.

01:00.724 --> 01:01.551
It's going
to be great!

01:01.551 --> 01:02.620
You'll see!

01:07.620 --> 01:08.344
Markus.

01:08.344 --> 01:09.931
You like working
with your dad?

01:09.931 --> 01:10.965
I do.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.137
Yeah, it's been awesome.

01:12.137 --> 01:14.068
Snakepit's already sold
like half a million copies.

01:14.068 --> 01:15.482
So we think we're going
to start franchising-

01:15.482 --> 01:17.551
into toys and movies.

01:17.551 --> 01:18.206
The whole thing.

01:18.206 --> 01:19.000
Wow!

01:20.517 --> 01:21.482
So long, sucker.

01:24.034 --> 01:24.724
Unbelievable.

01:24.724 --> 01:25.620
<i>All right!</i>

01:25.620 --> 01:26.758
That's it for
this session!

01:26.758 --> 01:27.482
Surviving players-

01:27.482 --> 01:28.931
are still in
the running-

01:28.931 --> 01:31.310
for our one hundred
thousand dollar prize!

01:32.034 --> 01:34.172
Next session
starts in ten.

02:11.586 --> 02:12.551
Sarah.

02:12.655 --> 02:13.551
Hey.

02:13.551 --> 02:14.551
I thought you could
use some caffeine.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.241
Oh!

02:15.241 --> 02:16.137
Thank you.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.586
What time did you
get up this morning?

02:17.586 --> 02:18.586
Just after six.

02:18.586 --> 02:20.275
I hope you two were
able to get more sleep.

02:20.275 --> 02:21.413
Yeah, Rex was snoring-

02:21.413 --> 02:23.000
before your side of
the bed even got cold.

02:24.655 --> 02:25.896
The victim is
Alex Davies-

02:25.896 --> 02:28.241
owner of a local
board game company.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.344
What's with
all the snakes?

02:29.344 --> 02:31.206
<i>According to the janitor
who found the body-</i>

02:31.206 --> 02:33.206
they're decorations from a
tournament held yesterday.

02:33.206 --> 02:33.862
A tournament?

02:33.862 --> 02:35.103
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:35.103 --> 02:36.689
<i>Celebrating the one-year
anniversary of their big game.</i>

02:36.689 --> 02:39.344
Apparently, the top prize is
a hundred thousand dollars.

02:40.137 --> 02:41.620
That's a lot of
money for a game.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.724
Could be our motive.

02:42.724 --> 02:44.344
I've seen people
kill for la lot less.

02:45.827 --> 02:47.517
<i>Wow, it looks like he
was in some fight.</i>

02:47.517 --> 02:49.586
<i>Was he beaten
to death?</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:51.275
Yeah, I'm not sure.

02:51.275 --> 02:52.241
Something looks off.

02:52.241 --> 02:53.482
I was actually just
about to go in there-

02:53.482 --> 02:54.310
<i>and have a look.</i>

02:54.310 --> 02:55.655
This is like your
worst nightmare.

02:56.724 --> 02:57.448
What do you mean?

02:57.448 --> 02:58.413
Your snake phobia.

03:00.241 --> 03:01.758
It's not a phobia.

03:02.241 --> 03:03.793
Well you did have your
head under the pillow-

03:03.793 --> 03:05.655
for the whole asp scene
of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

03:05.655 --> 03:06.586
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:06.586 --> 03:07.551
That's because they
were real snakes.

03:07.551 --> 03:08.586
These are toys.

03:09.275 --> 03:09.965
Okay.

03:10.068 --> 03:10.689
I see.

03:10.689 --> 03:11.344
Yeah.

03:13.344 --> 03:14.275
<i>What is it pal?</i>

03:14.275 --> 03:15.310
What's the matter, Rex?

03:15.310 --> 03:16.000
Hey look!

03:16.310 --> 03:17.068
Look!

03:17.310 --> 03:18.000
They don't bite!

03:19.620 --> 03:20.827
It's okay pal.

03:20.827 --> 03:22.310
I'm going to talk
to the janitor.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.103
<i>Okay.</i>

03:23.206 --> 03:23.793
Rex.

03:23.793 --> 03:24.724
Come on.

03:25.241 --> 03:25.931
Sir?

03:27.068 --> 03:28.103
<i>Hi friend!</i>

03:28.103 --> 03:29.034
<i>Who are you?</i>

03:29.344 --> 03:30.206
<i>This is Rex.</i>

03:30.206 --> 03:31.275
<i>He's my partner.</i>

03:31.275 --> 03:32.896
Detective Hudson, SJPD.

03:32.896 --> 03:34.241
What time did you get
here this morning?

03:34.241 --> 03:34.965
Uh-

03:34.965 --> 03:36.172
About 5:30.

03:36.172 --> 03:39.206
Did you notice anything
suspicious when you arrived?

03:39.206 --> 03:40.206
No.

03:50.482 --> 03:52.241
Wait, that can't be.

04:06.034 --> 04:06.655
No no no!

04:06.655 --> 04:07.344
No no Rex!

04:07.448 --> 04:08.000
Stay back!

04:08.000 --> 04:08.793
It's not safe.

04:08.793 --> 04:09.689
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:09.689 --> 04:10.517
<i>Help me out.</i>

04:10.517 --> 04:11.206
<i>You okay?</i>

04:11.448 --> 04:12.413
What?

04:12.413 --> 04:13.241
What is it?

04:15.310 --> 04:17.103
I think he was
killed by a snake.

04:34.896 --> 04:37.241
<i>There are least two
sets of puncture marks.</i>

04:37.241 --> 04:39.275
The swelling and discolouration
weren't from a beating.

04:39.275 --> 04:42.413
I think they're the result
of venom poisoning!

04:42.413 --> 04:43.241
You're shaking.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.275
Well I can't
stop thinking-

04:44.275 --> 04:46.172
what if there was a snake
in the box with me?

04:47.103 --> 04:47.758
Yeah.

04:52.655 --> 04:53.448
<i>Are you okay?</i>

04:53.448 --> 04:54.586
<i>Your energy is-</i>

04:55.448 --> 04:56.655
Whoah.

04:56.758 --> 04:57.862
<i>There might be
a venomous snake-</i>

04:57.862 --> 04:58.931
in our crime scene.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.896
We're just waiting
on Animal Control.

05:01.517 --> 05:02.689
A snake?

05:04.103 --> 05:05.068
Oh cool!

05:06.724 --> 05:07.827
<i>What?</i>

05:07.827 --> 05:09.517
Snakes are fascinating!

05:09.517 --> 05:10.724
<i>Hey why wait
for Animal Control?</i>

05:10.724 --> 05:13.000
Can't we just send
Rex to sniff it out?

05:14.172 --> 05:16.758
Did you miss the part
where I said <i>venomous</i>?

05:16.758 --> 05:18.689
Yeah, what are you
doing here anyway?

05:19.517 --> 05:20.931
I heard the victim's
Alex Davies.

05:20.931 --> 05:22.103
I know his
son Markus.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.344
I was here with
him last night.

05:24.241 --> 05:24.862
Come on.

05:24.862 --> 05:25.551
Yeah.

05:26.758 --> 05:27.896
Is Mr. Davies' body-

05:27.896 --> 05:28.551
still in there?

05:28.551 --> 05:29.586
Karma, it's not safe.

05:29.586 --> 05:31.034
Oh, I'll be fine.

05:31.034 --> 05:32.482
Statistically you're more
likely to get attacked-

05:32.482 --> 05:34.172
by a dog
than a snake.

05:35.172 --> 05:36.517
Sorry Rex.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.551
But it's the
truth though.

05:44.448 --> 05:46.448
<i>How are
you holding up?</i>

05:46.448 --> 05:47.793
<i>I think
I'm in shock.</i>

05:47.793 --> 05:49.862
I just can't believe
that he's gone.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.827
Look, did you see him at
all after the tournament?

05:54.068 --> 05:55.344
I mean, we locked
up together.

05:55.344 --> 05:57.000
And then
I met you.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
He came back
to the office.

05:59.000 --> 05:59.793
Why?

06:01.068 --> 06:02.310
I don't know.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.620
Maybe he
had a date.

06:04.241 --> 06:05.068
With who?

06:06.172 --> 06:07.758
We didn't really talk
about that kind of thing.

06:08.103 --> 06:08.862
<i>Oh Markus.</i>

06:10.241 --> 06:10.896
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

06:12.310 --> 06:13.448
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

06:16.655 --> 06:17.310
You're with the police?

06:17.310 --> 06:18.000
Mm-hmm.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.827
Detective Hudson.

06:19.241 --> 06:19.862
You are- ?

06:19.862 --> 06:20.793
Raya Knight.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.103
Alex's business partner.

06:23.172 --> 06:24.034
And friend.

06:25.344 --> 06:28.482
Um- Raya and my dad pretty much
created the Snakepit together.

06:28.482 --> 06:30.586
It really is a good
game Charlie.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.413
I'm really sorry
for your loss.

06:34.551 --> 06:36.241
When was the last time
that you spoke with Alex?

06:36.241 --> 06:37.413
Last night.

06:37.413 --> 06:39.448
We awarded the tournament
prize money together.

06:39.551 --> 06:40.586
What did
you do after?

06:41.379 --> 06:43.379
I spent the night
with my sister.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.379
Am I free to go
into my office?

06:46.241 --> 06:47.000
Unfortunately no.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.413
There may be a
venomous snake-

06:49.413 --> 06:50.620
<i>on the premises.</i>

06:50.620 --> 06:51.793
What?

06:51.793 --> 06:52.551
Sorry.

06:52.551 --> 06:53.793
Did you just
say snake?

06:53.793 --> 06:54.758
Like a real snake?

06:56.103 --> 06:57.172
Is that what
killed my dad?

06:57.931 --> 06:59.827
Uh, it's a possibility.

06:59.827 --> 07:00.551
Listen.

07:00.551 --> 07:01.896
Has your father-

07:01.896 --> 07:05.620
Has he had issues
with anyone recently?

07:08.172 --> 07:08.827
Raya?

07:10.724 --> 07:11.689
Steve Sader.

07:11.689 --> 07:13.448
<i>He was a former
junior designer.</i>

07:13.448 --> 07:14.758
He was
going to sue.

07:14.758 --> 07:18.137
Insisted Alex stole
his idea for Snakepit.

07:26.482 --> 07:27.586
<i>So there's
two suspects.</i>

07:27.586 --> 07:28.896
This Steve Sader-

07:28.896 --> 07:29.655
and the mystery woman-

07:29.655 --> 07:30.793
that Alex went
on a date with.

07:30.793 --> 07:31.758
Yeah.

07:31.758 --> 07:33.206
I'll see what I can
dig up on his phone.

07:33.206 --> 07:34.758
I'll bet there was
a long list of women-

07:34.758 --> 07:35.482
wanting to date him.

07:35.482 --> 07:36.517
Why's that?

07:36.517 --> 07:38.517
Well, I mean Alex was
just a total legend-

07:38.517 --> 07:39.689
in board game circles.

07:39.689 --> 07:40.793
I mean-

07:40.793 --> 07:42.344
bit of a niche
market there.

07:42.344 --> 07:43.206
Oh not at all!

07:43.206 --> 07:44.206
I mean last year-

07:44.206 --> 07:45.620
the tabletop game industry-

07:45.620 --> 07:46.931
raked in ten
billion dollars.

07:46.931 --> 07:48.448
<i>And because of Snakepit-</i>

07:48.448 --> 07:49.965
Cottage Games is
valued at six mil.

07:49.965 --> 07:52.620
So a lot of money
at stake, then.

07:52.620 --> 07:53.827
I just never got
the impression-

07:53.827 --> 07:55.241
it was about that
for Alex you know?

07:55.241 --> 07:56.586
He just seemed to
really love games.

07:57.931 --> 07:59.068
That's what
they all say.

08:00.241 --> 08:01.137
They're ready
for us downstairs.

08:01.137 --> 08:01.827
Come on.

08:01.931 --> 08:02.758
<i>Let's go pal.</i>

08:10.000 --> 08:12.310
Dr. Truong's initial
assessment was correct.

08:12.655 --> 08:15.103
The victim was
bitten nine times-

08:15.103 --> 08:16.827
<i>and died of
venom poisoning.</i>

08:19.448 --> 08:21.931
Can we be sure Alex was
the intended target here?

08:23.000 --> 08:23.896
It's likely.

08:23.896 --> 08:26.379
His arm was broken
right before he died.

08:26.379 --> 08:28.344
So he was forced
into the box.

08:28.344 --> 08:29.551
Do we have a
time of death?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.689
<i>Alex's fitness tracker-</i>

08:30.689 --> 08:33.241
stopped recording a
heartbeat at 12:15 AM.

08:33.241 --> 08:34.482
And I'm
not so sure-

08:34.482 --> 08:36.551
that a time of death is really
going to help in this case.

08:36.551 --> 08:37.827
Venom poisoning
can take hours-

08:37.827 --> 08:38.724
to kill somebody.

08:38.724 --> 08:39.931
So what we really
need to find out-

08:39.931 --> 08:41.344
is when he was
bitten by the snake.

08:41.344 --> 08:42.896
And to know that,
we need to figure out-

08:42.896 --> 08:43.931
what kind of
snake bit him.

08:43.931 --> 08:44.965
Do you have a
blood sample-

08:44.965 --> 08:46.517
I can use to
run an ELISA?

08:49.206 --> 08:52.448
Identifying a species should
help you find the owner as well.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.310
Snakes are highly regulated.

08:54.310 --> 08:55.275
Thank goodness.

08:55.275 --> 08:57.310
Killed by a snake
at a tournament-

08:57.310 --> 08:59.310
for the game that he
created about snakes.

08:59.310 --> 09:01.000
That can't be
a coincidence.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.655
Jesse.

09:01.655 --> 09:03.931
Find this Steve Sader.

09:03.931 --> 09:05.241
Yeah, will do.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.379
Okay team!

09:19.379 --> 09:20.758
Let's stay frosty!

09:20.758 --> 09:21.517
That is to say-

09:21.517 --> 09:22.655
<i>Let's keep our
eyes open!</i>

09:22.655 --> 09:25.310
This snake has already
killed one person today.

09:41.344 --> 09:44.034
Tracing the snake
back to its owner-

09:44.034 --> 09:46.655
could help lead
us to the killer.

09:46.655 --> 09:47.551
I'll track that.

09:48.586 --> 09:50.896
You know that the owner
could have other snakes.

09:51.206 --> 09:52.275
It's not a phobia.

09:52.931 --> 09:53.586
<i>Okay and look.</i>

09:53.586 --> 09:54.310
<i>Even if it was-</i>

09:55.517 --> 09:57.620
the best way to get over it
would be to expose myself-

09:57.620 --> 09:59.068
to the thing that
frightens me, so-

10:00.965 --> 10:03.758
Anyone ever tell you
that you're kind of sexy-

10:03.758 --> 10:06.241
when you try and intellectualize
an irrational fear?

10:06.241 --> 10:08.000
Okay first of all,
it's not irrational.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We're socialized to
find snakes upsetting.

10:10.827 --> 10:11.655
<i>Charlie.</i>

10:11.758 --> 10:12.758
Hey there you are.

10:14.827 --> 10:15.655
What is it, Jesse?

10:15.655 --> 10:17.000
A location
for Steve Sader.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.034
Three of them, actually.

10:18.931 --> 10:19.827
What are you
talking about?

10:19.827 --> 10:21.034
Well he's doing
deliveries for FoodGo.

10:21.034 --> 10:22.448
You need to catch
him on his route.

10:23.586 --> 10:24.241
Thanks.

10:24.241 --> 10:24.931
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:26.344 --> 10:27.344
Where am I going?

10:27.344 --> 10:28.275
I'll text
it to you.

10:29.586 --> 10:30.379
<i>Rex.</i>

10:42.655 --> 10:43.862
<i>You've got
to be kidding me.</i>

10:47.413 --> 10:48.448
Rex, go!

10:57.103 --> 10:57.931
<i>Whoh whoah!</i>

10:57.931 --> 10:58.758
<i>Okay, uh-</i>

10:59.793 --> 11:01.000
<i>All right.</i>

11:01.862 --> 11:03.000
<i>That's just
his way of saying-</i>

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
we need you to answer
a few questions.

11:19.068 --> 11:21.379
So I'm guessing this
is about Alex Davies?

11:21.379 --> 11:23.068
I read online
he died.

11:23.068 --> 11:24.724
You don't seem
too upset about it.

11:24.724 --> 11:27.827
Alex stole my idea
and made huge bank.

11:27.827 --> 11:30.965
I'm sorry if I'm not beaten up
about him kicking the bucket.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.862
What exactly happened
with Snakepit?

11:33.862 --> 11:35.275
You claim you came
up with the idea.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.310
After a wild
camping trip, yeah.

11:38.310 --> 11:39.862
I pitched Alex
this race game-

11:39.862 --> 11:41.965
where players had
to dodge swamps-

11:41.965 --> 11:44.000
<i>and hunting nets to
get to their cabin.</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:46.379
The next day, he
pitches Snakepit.

11:46.379 --> 11:48.068
Which uses a
similar idea.

11:48.068 --> 11:50.000
Try the same.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.896
But that ass
wouldn't admit it.

11:52.758 --> 11:54.206
You have an alibi
for last night?

11:54.517 --> 11:56.586
Yeah I was delivering
for FoodGo-

11:56.586 --> 11:57.379
between eight and midnight.

11:57.379 --> 11:58.344
<i>Like always.</i>

11:59.172 --> 12:00.586
<i>Look, my deliveries
are getting cold.</i>

12:00.586 --> 12:01.551
Can I go?

12:03.896 --> 12:04.724
Thanks for your time.

12:16.482 --> 12:17.172
<i>Hey!</i>

12:17.172 --> 12:18.137
Everything okay?

12:19.103 --> 12:20.103
Yeah.

12:20.103 --> 12:22.068
I was trying to make
dinner plans with someone.

12:22.068 --> 12:24.275
But I haven't heard back from
them in a couple of days, so-

12:24.275 --> 12:25.000
Ouch!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.310
Sounds like
you got ghosted.

12:26.551 --> 12:27.448
Ghost- ?

12:27.586 --> 12:28.241
I'm sorry.

12:28.241 --> 12:28.931
That's-

12:29.896 --> 12:31.000
Who's next
on your list?

12:31.379 --> 12:32.379
My list?

12:32.793 --> 12:33.862
Of matches!

12:33.862 --> 12:35.793
The best cure is to get
right back in the saddle.

12:35.793 --> 12:36.448
No.

12:36.448 --> 12:37.482
Jesse look.

12:37.482 --> 12:39.034
Ann is the only person
outside of this office-

12:39.034 --> 12:41.034
that I've even spoken
to in the last year so-

12:41.413 --> 12:42.068
Hold on.

12:43.103 --> 12:44.448
Are you not
online dating?

12:45.655 --> 12:46.379
No!

12:46.758 --> 12:47.551
No!

12:47.551 --> 12:48.689
Swiping feels
like a video game.

12:48.689 --> 12:50.344
It's just too impersonal.

12:50.344 --> 12:51.275
It's not really
my style.

12:51.275 --> 12:52.068
It's not-

12:52.068 --> 12:54.551
No it is the modern
singles bar!

12:54.551 --> 12:55.517
Charlie you'd agree right?

12:55.517 --> 12:56.482
Don't know, never tried.

12:56.482 --> 12:57.172
You've never- ?

12:57.172 --> 12:58.344
Guys!

12:58.344 --> 12:59.586
Are you kidding me?

12:59.586 --> 13:01.034
You've got to go
where the people are!

13:01.034 --> 13:02.275
And the people
are online.

13:02.275 --> 13:03.827
Boss, I will set you
up with an account.

13:03.827 --> 13:05.172
Charlie, I could
do you one too!

13:06.448 --> 13:09.862
Can we talk about anything
other than my love life please?

13:09.862 --> 13:10.827
With pleasure.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.206
I spoke with
Steve Sader.

13:13.206 --> 13:15.931
He has the motive and definitely
the attitude for the crime.

13:15.931 --> 13:17.344
But he said he was
working last night.

13:17.344 --> 13:18.172
Jesse, can you- ?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.344
<i>Yeah I'm already on it.</i>

13:19.344 --> 13:21.379
I IDd Alex's date
from the other night.

13:22.172 --> 13:23.034
Her name is Georgia.

13:23.034 --> 13:24.448
<i>New York area code.</i>

13:24.448 --> 13:25.620
<i>She's coming
in later today.</i>

13:25.620 --> 13:26.655
<i>That's quick work.</i>

13:26.655 --> 13:28.413
Yeah, well hopefully
confirming Steve's alibi-

13:28.413 --> 13:29.689
will be just
as quick.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.793
Then I can get to crafting that
online dating profile for you.

13:32.172 --> 13:33.827
You will do
no such thing.

13:44.068 --> 13:45.655
Blood test shows
Alex Davies-

13:45.655 --> 13:47.310
was killed by
a black mamba.

13:48.206 --> 13:48.965
Whoa!

13:50.000 --> 13:51.172
Their venom
is super potent.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.655
Just two drops
would be lethal.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.172
Does that mean Alex
would have died quickly?

13:55.172 --> 13:56.655
Within 30 minutes.

13:56.655 --> 13:58.172
Likely of cardiac arrest.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.965
Black mamba venom's cardiotoxic?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.862
Neurotoxic, too.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.172
So he would have
been paralyzed first.

14:05.172 --> 14:05.896
Oh my gosh.

14:05.896 --> 14:08.379
That is a terrible
way to go.

14:08.379 --> 14:09.482
Yeah, and you know-

14:09.482 --> 14:11.482
it probably wasn't very
nice for the snake, either.

14:14.517 --> 14:16.379
What is it
about snakes?

14:16.379 --> 14:18.724
Why do you like
them so much?

14:18.724 --> 14:19.931
Well-

14:19.931 --> 14:22.241
they're stunning, for starters.

14:22.344 --> 14:23.275
<i>I mean-</i>

14:23.275 --> 14:24.862
have you ever seen
their scales up close?

14:25.931 --> 14:27.034
They shimmer-

14:27.034 --> 14:27.931
like a rainbow!

14:27.931 --> 14:28.620
Here!

14:30.827 --> 14:31.517
Look.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.551
Oh!

14:34.344 --> 14:35.206
You've got it bad.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.931
Just a reflex.

14:36.931 --> 14:38.724
Um- is that a
black mamba?

14:38.724 --> 14:39.689
It is.

14:39.931 --> 14:41.206
Hmmm.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.172
Because there are no registered
black mambas in the province.

14:44.241 --> 14:47.172
They're really rare
outside of Africa.

14:47.172 --> 14:49.965
Um- I've actually never
seen one in the flesh.

14:49.965 --> 14:52.448
You don't have any idea who in
town might have one do you?

14:54.620 --> 14:56.620
I have heard
of one guy.

14:58.034 --> 14:59.448
<i>♪Boom bah-oh</i>

14:59.448 --> 15:02.137
<i>♪Boom boom boom
bah-day-oh♪</i>

15:16.827 --> 15:18.827
This is exposure in a
controlled environment.

15:20.344 --> 15:21.724
It's totally safe.

15:31.206 --> 15:32.275
Alex is dead?

15:33.172 --> 15:34.620
I just saw him
last night.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.931
How long have you
two been dating?

15:36.931 --> 15:38.000
Oh, we're not dating.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.931
I met with
him last night-

15:39.931 --> 15:41.310
because my company in
New York is interested-

15:41.310 --> 15:42.689
in buying Cottage Games.

15:43.517 --> 15:44.793
Cottage Games
is for sale?

15:44.793 --> 15:45.758
Not officially.

15:45.758 --> 15:46.689
But Todd Harvey
reached out-

15:46.689 --> 15:49.448
<i>and said they'd
be open to an offer.</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:50.689
Snakepit is huge.

15:50.689 --> 15:52.482
My bosses jumped
at the chance.

15:52.482 --> 15:53.620
Who's Todd Harvey?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.931
He owns half of
Cottage Games.

15:57.172 --> 15:57.827
Huh.

15:58.965 --> 16:00.827
So you met with Alex
and Raya last night-

16:00.827 --> 16:01.827
to discuss the sale?

16:02.517 --> 16:03.379
Just Alex.

16:04.413 --> 16:05.482
When there's multiple
stakeholders involved-

16:05.482 --> 16:07.931
it's all about just getting
that one person on side.

16:08.620 --> 16:09.965
Speaking of-

16:09.965 --> 16:12.379
I'm going to have to find
someone else to negotiate with-

16:12.379 --> 16:13.862
now that he's dead.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.724
Okay.

16:16.724 --> 16:17.413
Um-

16:18.620 --> 16:20.000
What did Alex
think of your offer?

16:20.931 --> 16:21.724
Not much.

16:21.724 --> 16:23.000
Unfortunately.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.413
Uh-huh.

16:24.413 --> 16:26.827
Did you see anybody in the
building when you were there?

16:27.965 --> 16:29.344
No, no one.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.413
What time did
the meeting end?

16:31.413 --> 16:35.000
I took a cab back to
my hotel around 10:30.

16:35.172 --> 16:35.827
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

16:35.827 --> 16:37.862
Alex was fine
when I left.

16:38.758 --> 16:41.275
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

16:43.310 --> 16:44.000
No no.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.482
That's everything for now.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.379
But I am going to need
you to stay in town-

16:47.379 --> 16:49.517
until the investigation
is complete.

16:49.517 --> 16:51.137
Oh I'm not
going anywhere.

16:51.137 --> 16:52.758
Days after a
shakeup like this-

16:52.758 --> 16:54.931
are prime
deal-making time.

17:01.862 --> 17:03.137
<i>Hey Jesse.</i>

17:03.137 --> 17:04.862
I need you to confirm
Georgia Hale's cab ride-

17:04.862 --> 17:07.413
from Cottage Games to
the Irvine Hotel last night.

17:07.413 --> 17:08.275
Yeah sure.

17:09.000 --> 17:09.620
<i>Wait.</i>

17:09.620 --> 17:10.344
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:10.344 --> 17:11.413
Uh, don't
worry about it.

17:12.517 --> 17:13.517
FoodGo confirmed-

17:13.517 --> 17:15.275
that Steve Sader was
working last night.

17:15.275 --> 17:17.034
<i>But according to the
GPS on his phone-</i>

17:17.034 --> 17:19.103
<i>he wasn't anywhere near
the Cottage Games office.</i>

17:19.103 --> 17:21.448
Well did Alex's date have
anything useful to say?

17:21.448 --> 17:22.310
It wasn't a date.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.413
Georgia works for
an American company-

17:24.413 --> 17:26.068
looking to buy
Cottage Games.

17:26.068 --> 17:27.896
Markus didn't say
anything about a sale.

17:27.896 --> 17:30.551
He mentioned somebody
named Todd Harvey.

17:31.103 --> 17:31.758
Who's that?

17:32.724 --> 17:34.689
He apparently owns
half of Cottage Games.

17:34.689 --> 17:36.448
Oh, he's a
venture capitalist!

17:36.448 --> 17:38.172
Apparently hopped on
board a couple of years ago-

17:38.172 --> 17:39.344
to help fund Snakepit.

17:39.344 --> 17:40.448
Well if that sale
goes through-

17:40.448 --> 17:42.482
then Todd and Raya
stand to make millions.

17:42.482 --> 17:43.724
I guess Markus
would too-

17:43.724 --> 17:44.586
with his inheritance.

17:44.586 --> 17:45.793
Exactly.

17:45.793 --> 17:47.448
So why is nobody
talking about it?

17:47.448 --> 17:48.137
Yeah.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.275
<i>Slither down
to RJ's reptile park!</i>

17:55.275 --> 17:56.517
<i>And see what everybody's
hissing about!</i>

17:56.517 --> 17:57.206
Oh!

17:58.137 --> 17:58.896
<i>Everyone is welcome-</i>

17:58.896 --> 18:00.137
<i>to come face
to fang-</i>

18:00.137 --> 18:02.310
<i>with some of the world's
most beautiful scaly critters!</i>

18:02.310 --> 18:06.103
<i>From South America's
majestic green anacondas-</i>

18:06.103 --> 18:08.862
<i>to the deadly
African black mamba-</i>

18:08.862 --> 18:10.586
<i>Uh- excuse me.</i>

18:10.586 --> 18:12.862
If you're here to see the
snakes, I can't help you.

18:12.862 --> 18:13.827
Oh, no I don't-

18:14.724 --> 18:16.310
I just have
some questions.

18:16.310 --> 18:17.689
I'm with SJPD.

18:17.689 --> 18:20.862
The Department of Wildlife asked
me every question under the sun-

18:20.862 --> 18:21.896
when they took my
babies away-

18:21.896 --> 18:22.862
<i>last week.</i>

18:24.137 --> 18:25.931
<i>Paperwork irregularities.</i>

18:26.172 --> 18:27.103
<i>Please.</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:28.827
Mister-

18:30.241 --> 18:31.379
Reptile Joey.

18:31.379 --> 18:32.793
You can
call me RJ.

18:33.517 --> 18:34.344
RJ.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.965
I'm sorry your babies
were confiscated.

18:38.965 --> 18:41.034
Um- was there
a black mamba-

18:41.034 --> 18:42.448
<i>amongst them
by any chance?</i>

18:43.172 --> 18:44.000
Kobe!

18:44.965 --> 18:46.551
Had him ever since
he was a snakelet!

18:47.793 --> 18:49.241
And they
just took him!

18:53.103 --> 18:54.344
RJ.

18:54.344 --> 18:56.862
Are you sure the Department of
Wildlife took your black mamba?

18:56.862 --> 18:57.965
<i>Because we-</i>

18:57.965 --> 19:00.172
believe it might have
killed a man last night.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.172
Hey you want
to grab a bite?

19:09.172 --> 19:10.275
You've got to eat
something, man.

19:11.655 --> 19:12.862
I can't eat.

19:12.862 --> 19:14.689
<i>My stomach is
just in knots.</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:21.482
You-

19:22.000 --> 19:22.620
You know-

19:22.620 --> 19:23.620
all I ever wanted-

19:23.620 --> 19:25.172
<i>was to work
with my dad.</i>

19:25.172 --> 19:28.551
It was awesome planning the
Snakepit expansion with him.

19:30.310 --> 19:32.068
You're lucky to have
spent that time with him.

19:33.448 --> 19:35.551
You know, my dad
died when I was nine.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.586
I hardly got
to know him.

19:37.862 --> 19:39.413
<i>Jesse I'm so sorry.</i>

19:39.413 --> 19:40.586
<i>I had no idea.</i>

19:40.586 --> 19:41.275
No no.

19:42.034 --> 19:44.034
Look, it was a
long time ago.

19:44.034 --> 19:45.034
It happened.

19:48.758 --> 19:49.413
Look Markus.

19:49.413 --> 19:50.517
I don't mean
to pry, but-

19:51.482 --> 19:52.931
But why didn't tell
us about the sale?

19:55.448 --> 19:56.103
I don't know.

19:56.103 --> 19:57.241
It didn't seem important.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.275
Do the police
think that-

20:01.275 --> 20:02.724
that had something to
do with Dad's death?

20:02.724 --> 20:04.517
Not necessarily, okay?

20:04.517 --> 20:06.586
But it could've meant a big
payday for a lot of people.

20:06.586 --> 20:09.689
And we have to explore
different financial motives.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.586
Dad never would've sold.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.344
Never.

20:13.344 --> 20:14.689
Did that ruffle
any feathers?

20:14.689 --> 20:15.482
Yeah, I mean-

20:15.482 --> 20:17.310
there were spirited discussions.

20:17.896 --> 20:18.620
Like-

20:20.172 --> 20:21.655
Dad loved to debate.

20:22.586 --> 20:24.310
And he loved to
win even more.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.655
It actually drove me
crazy when I was a kid.

20:26.655 --> 20:27.517
But-

20:28.620 --> 20:30.724
then it became
him and Raya's thing.

20:32.724 --> 20:34.896
Spirited discussions.

20:34.896 --> 20:37.551
Does that mean
Raya was pro sale?

20:39.103 --> 20:39.827
I don't know.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.448
But maybe it's
time I found out.

20:53.137 --> 20:54.413
<i>Mr. Harvey.</i>

20:55.137 --> 20:55.862
Detective Hudson.

20:55.862 --> 20:57.896
This is my
partner, Rex.

20:57.896 --> 20:58.793
Detective.

20:59.827 --> 21:01.310
Uh- okay.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.206
Please, step
into my office.

21:03.448 --> 21:06.344
I was told Animal Control hasn't
cleared the building yet?

21:06.344 --> 21:08.000
Well hopefully
that'll change soon.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.310
Um- listen.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.137
<i>Could you tell me how you got
involved with Cottage Games?</i>

21:12.137 --> 21:15.551
Alex and Raya pitched me
Snakepit a couple of years back.

21:15.551 --> 21:17.448
My instincts said
it could be huge.

21:17.448 --> 21:19.689
But they needed cash to get
production off the ground.

21:19.689 --> 21:20.827
And you provided
the cash?

21:22.241 --> 21:23.275
A million dollars-

21:23.275 --> 21:24.862
in exchange for forty-nine
percent of the company.

21:25.689 --> 21:26.448
Alex and Raya-

21:26.448 --> 21:28.172
they kept controlling shares?

21:29.758 --> 21:31.655
Cottage Games is
their life's work.

21:31.655 --> 21:34.275
They're the ones who should
be directing its course.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.310
Your partner looks hungry.

21:37.310 --> 21:38.482
You let him eat
human food?

21:39.655 --> 21:40.965
He's on the clock.

21:40.965 --> 21:42.862
But thank you.

21:42.965 --> 21:45.103
<i>Listen, what was your
take on the offer -</i>

21:45.103 --> 21:46.758
made by Georgia
Hale's company?

21:46.758 --> 21:48.793
I thought it was
more than fair.

21:48.793 --> 21:50.724
<i>I told Alex and
Raya as much.</i>

21:50.724 --> 21:52.172
But left the
choice with them.

21:52.172 --> 21:53.620
But Alex wasn't
interested?

21:53.620 --> 21:54.758
Alex was sure-

21:54.758 --> 21:57.689
he could turn Snakepit
into the next big franchise.

21:57.689 --> 22:00.551
<i>You know,
imagined a TV show.</i>

22:00.551 --> 22:01.310
Maybe a movie.

22:01.310 --> 22:04.310
A bit naive
if you ask me.

22:04.827 --> 22:06.103
What happens
now that he's gone?

22:06.103 --> 22:07.655
Does Markus
get Alex's vote?

22:07.655 --> 22:08.379
No.

22:08.586 --> 22:10.241
Alex's shares
go to Raya.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.793
<i>All decisions-</i>

22:11.793 --> 22:14.241
relating to Snakepit are
now hers and hers alone.

22:14.344 --> 22:15.103
Huh.

22:17.206 --> 22:18.896
<i>♪Baby baby</i>

22:18.896 --> 22:21.620
<i>♪I think the
time is right♪</i>

22:22.448 --> 22:23.413
<i>Hey!</i>

22:23.413 --> 22:24.413
<i>♪Baby baby</i>

22:24.413 --> 22:25.620
How's everything going
on the snake front?

22:25.620 --> 22:28.448
I think we can be fairly
certain it belonged to RJ.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.413
Who's RJ?

22:29.413 --> 22:32.241
The owner of Reptile
Joey's Reptile Park.

22:32.241 --> 22:33.379
He had a mamba
named Kobe.

22:33.379 --> 22:34.586
<i>But it was confiscated-</i>

22:34.586 --> 22:36.655
by the Department
of Wildlife last week.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.103
How'd it make its way
to Cottage Games?

22:38.103 --> 22:39.275
That's the question.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.034
I have a call into
them to find out.

22:42.034 --> 22:43.413
Hey Snake Master.

22:43.413 --> 22:46.448
Were you able to confirm the
time of Georgia Hale's cab ride?

22:46.448 --> 22:47.551
I did, I did, yeah.

22:47.551 --> 22:50.068
The driver picked her up
from Cottage Games at 10:35.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.793
Ehhh.

22:51.793 --> 22:53.827
That effectively rules
her out as the murderer.

22:53.827 --> 22:55.482
Black mamba venom is
lethal in thirty minutes.

22:57.344 --> 22:58.206
It's your move.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.551
Oh yeah.

23:00.551 --> 23:03.103
So if we know Alex's
heart stopped at 12:15-

23:03.103 --> 23:05.517
the bite happened
around 11:45.

23:06.241 --> 23:08.310
Do we think that had something
to do with the company sale?

23:08.310 --> 23:09.379
<i>Well, I mean-</i>

23:09.379 --> 23:10.931
Markus said his dad
would never go for it.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.344
<i>Oh boss!</i>

23:12.344 --> 23:14.482
Look who's
on your tail.

23:14.482 --> 23:16.000
Oh no!

23:16.758 --> 23:17.724
<i>So what about Raya-</i>

23:17.724 --> 23:18.517
the partner?

23:18.517 --> 23:20.241
Do we think she
wanted to sell?

23:20.241 --> 23:21.482
Uh- well, I'm
about to find out.

23:21.482 --> 23:23.034
<i>I have a meeting with
her in ten minutes.</i>

23:23.034 --> 23:24.689
Um so-

23:25.758 --> 23:26.758
You guys have fun.

23:27.827 --> 23:28.586
Rex.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.068
Let's go.

23:33.793 --> 23:34.655
I guess we're
done here?

23:35.931 --> 23:37.310
You guys got
meetings too?

23:37.310 --> 23:38.448
What about the game?

23:38.931 --> 23:39.655
Rain cheque.

23:41.689 --> 23:42.655
Okay!

23:43.931 --> 23:45.620
Well it looks like I am going
to take some photo evidence-

23:45.620 --> 23:48.241
because looks like Jesse's
going to win this one.

23:50.344 --> 23:51.344
And pay the
bill again.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.482
Hey, stay close pal.

23:59.482 --> 24:00.655
Animal Control
cleared the floor, but-

24:00.758 --> 24:01.758
<i>Everyone has to move on.</i>

24:01.758 --> 24:02.827
<i>And we have to
move forward!</i>

24:02.827 --> 24:04.310
<i>Trust me, it's
what's best, okay?</i>

24:04.310 --> 24:05.689
<i>I can't believe
that you'd do this!</i>

24:05.689 --> 24:06.448
<i>You don't understand.</i>

24:06.448 --> 24:07.310
<i>No no, I do!</i>

24:07.310 --> 24:08.034
<i>I get it!</i>

24:08.034 --> 24:09.517
You're betraying
my dad and I!

24:09.517 --> 24:10.655
Markus! Markus!

24:10.655 --> 24:11.724
Look Raya!

24:12.724 --> 24:14.206
You are the
snake here.

24:14.206 --> 24:14.965
Okay?

24:17.172 --> 24:18.068
Markus!

24:31.379 --> 24:32.551
<i>Raya?</i>

24:32.551 --> 24:33.448
Hey Detective.

24:34.344 --> 24:35.896
Sorry you had
to hear that.

24:35.896 --> 24:37.551
I promise
I'm no snake.

24:37.551 --> 24:39.655
What did Markus mean about
you betraying his father?

24:39.655 --> 24:41.655
Well, I'm selling
the company.

24:41.655 --> 24:43.068
From my understanding-

24:43.068 --> 24:44.482
that's not what
Alex wanted.

24:44.482 --> 24:45.758
Look Markus doesn't understand.

24:45.758 --> 24:47.137
But it's the best
thing for the company.

24:47.137 --> 24:47.827
So-

24:49.586 --> 24:50.655
And for you.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.448
Yes.

24:53.137 --> 24:54.000
And me.

25:19.379 --> 25:20.034
Hey!

25:20.034 --> 25:21.172
You guys
are here early!

25:22.241 --> 25:25.896
Yeah, just pondering this
whole art versus life thing.

25:25.896 --> 25:27.241
You want to
spell that out?

25:28.793 --> 25:31.103
Just this whole company's
a bit of a snake pit.

25:31.103 --> 25:33.344
<i>You've got Raya
who wants to sell.</i>

25:33.344 --> 25:36.068
<i>Her partner, who's
now dead, who doesn't.</i>

25:36.068 --> 25:37.172
<i>And there's
the son, Markus.</i>

25:37.172 --> 25:39.310
And- I don't
know for sure.

25:39.896 --> 25:42.000
<i>Then of course, Todd
Harvey, the investor.</i>

25:42.000 --> 25:44.586
And Steve Sader,
the angry inventor.

25:46.103 --> 25:47.586
Who killed Alex?

25:47.586 --> 25:48.862
<i>Right now-</i>

25:48.862 --> 25:50.965
I think I'd have
to go with Raya.

25:51.241 --> 25:52.275
Hey Jesse.

25:52.275 --> 25:53.448
Do you think you could
look into her financials?

25:53.448 --> 25:55.620
See if there's any reason
why she would need to sell-

25:55.620 --> 25:56.310
and fast?

25:56.310 --> 25:57.068
Yeah, sure thing.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.758
I just talked to the
Department of Wildlife.

26:02.758 --> 26:05.724
Even though they confiscated
a bunch of RJ's snakes-

26:05.724 --> 26:06.827
they can't find
a black mamba.

26:07.310 --> 26:08.793
<i>Was RJ
lying about it?</i>

26:08.793 --> 26:10.344
Maybe he could be
hiding it somewhere.

26:10.344 --> 26:11.724
I don't think
he was lying.

26:11.724 --> 26:13.551
But I'm on my way
to talk to him again.

26:13.551 --> 26:14.758
Okay.

26:22.517 --> 26:23.586
Kobe is missing?

26:23.586 --> 26:24.931
Oh my poor baby!

26:24.931 --> 26:27.758
We do believe we know where
Kobe is, generally speaking.

26:27.758 --> 26:29.758
Animal Control is
working to capture him.

26:29.758 --> 26:30.965
Oh they're not
going to get him.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.689
He's very shy.

26:31.689 --> 26:32.862
You should
let me do it.

26:32.862 --> 26:34.827
I don't think Animal Control
would appreciate that.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.413
Bunch of heartless-

26:36.413 --> 26:37.103
<i>Be that-</i>

26:37.103 --> 26:37.931
as it may-

26:37.931 --> 26:39.413
can you show me
where you kept Kobe?

26:39.413 --> 26:40.551
Oh sure, here.

26:40.551 --> 26:41.379
<i>Hold this.</i>

26:41.965 --> 26:42.827
Oh oh!

26:44.310 --> 26:44.965
Uh-

26:44.965 --> 26:46.034
It's okay.

26:46.034 --> 26:47.689
Mr. Noodles
won't hurt you.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.586
Give him a pat.

26:48.586 --> 26:49.655
<i>And he'll be your
friend for life.</i>

26:50.586 --> 26:51.275
Why wasn't this-

26:51.275 --> 26:53.551
er, Mr. Noodles- confiscated?

26:54.068 --> 26:55.448
You're not going
to take him, are you?

26:55.448 --> 26:57.931
No, I can assure
you I do not want him.

26:57.931 --> 26:59.000
He's harmless.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.965
That's the snake I take
to children's parties.

27:00.965 --> 27:01.965
RJ.

27:01.965 --> 27:03.551
Did you actually see-

27:03.551 --> 27:05.137
the Department of
Wildlife take Kobe?

27:05.137 --> 27:07.310
No, I was outside arguing
with their manager-

27:07.310 --> 27:08.689
while they packed
up all my babies.

27:08.689 --> 27:09.655
When was
the last time-

27:09.655 --> 27:11.344
you remember seeing
him in his vivarium?

27:11.344 --> 27:13.551
He was there for feeding
time Saturday night.

27:17.241 --> 27:18.965
How long has that
window been broken?

27:18.965 --> 27:20.068
Here can you
just take him?

27:20.068 --> 27:21.206
Oh sure.

27:21.310 --> 27:22.000
Thank you.

27:23.310 --> 27:26.310
<i>I didn't notice it until after
those Wildlife people came.</i>

27:26.310 --> 27:28.000
Figured those brutes
must have done it.

27:30.034 --> 27:31.724
I don't think so.

27:32.896 --> 27:36.103
It looks like it was
broken from the outside.

27:39.551 --> 27:41.448
I'm going to need-

27:41.448 --> 27:43.551
a list of all the events you
took Kobe to recently.

27:43.551 --> 27:46.034
You let me help find him
and you've got a deal.

27:46.344 --> 27:46.965
Okay, yeah.

27:46.965 --> 27:47.862
I can make
that happen.

27:48.448 --> 27:49.482
Hot damn!

27:49.965 --> 27:50.827
But wait.

27:50.827 --> 27:52.586
How's a list of events
going to help?

27:52.586 --> 27:55.310
It's going to help us
find out who took Kobe.

27:55.862 --> 27:56.793
Hear that Mr. Noodles?

27:56.793 --> 27:58.206
We're going
to find Kobe!

28:05.034 --> 28:05.931
Hey Jesse.

28:05.931 --> 28:07.206
You find anything
in Raya's financials?

28:07.206 --> 28:08.000
No, no.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.068
But I found
something in Todd's.

28:09.068 --> 28:11.103
He invested heavily in
drone delivery last year-

28:11.103 --> 28:12.482
<i>and lost a ton.</i>

28:12.482 --> 28:13.689
<i>His credit's maxed.</i>

28:13.689 --> 28:15.689
And the bank put his house
in foreclosure two months ago.

28:15.689 --> 28:18.448
That's right
around the time-

28:18.448 --> 28:19.793
that he reached out
to Georgia Hale.

28:19.793 --> 28:21.620
Yeah, Todd
needed the sale.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.310
Hey do we have any way to
connect him to the snakes?

28:24.758 --> 28:26.724
I might be able
to help with that.

28:26.724 --> 28:30.482
I found this in a broken window
next to Kobe's vivarium at RJ's.

28:30.482 --> 28:31.241
<i>Wait a second.</i>

28:31.241 --> 28:32.241
<i>You think that-</i>

28:32.241 --> 28:34.310
the killer stole Kobe
from the reptile park?

28:34.310 --> 28:36.034
That's pretty brazen.

28:36.034 --> 28:37.034
Or well-planned.

28:37.034 --> 28:39.068
I think someone who knew
RJ had a deadly snake-

28:39.068 --> 28:40.482
tipped off the
Department of Wildlife-

28:40.482 --> 28:41.931
and then stole Kobe-

28:41.931 --> 28:43.310
betting that RJ would
think he was confiscated-

28:43.310 --> 28:44.344
with the rest
of his collection.

28:44.344 --> 28:45.517
And nobody would
be looking for him.

28:45.517 --> 28:46.206
Exactly.

28:46.206 --> 28:46.862
Oh and here.

28:46.862 --> 28:47.551
RJ-

28:47.551 --> 28:48.517
gave me a list-

28:48.517 --> 28:50.793
of the events he attended
with his snakes.

28:50.793 --> 28:52.068
I figured that
would help us-

28:52.068 --> 28:54.206
<i>get a clue into who
we're looking for.</i>

28:54.206 --> 28:55.620
I'll have
a fast look.

28:55.620 --> 28:56.793
When did the
tip come in?

28:57.758 --> 28:59.137
Um- Saturday
night at seven.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.137
And when were RJ's
snakes confiscated?

29:01.137 --> 29:02.068
Sunday at noon.

29:02.068 --> 29:04.241
So the robbery was
probably Saturday night.

29:04.241 --> 29:05.103
I'll check Todd's alibi.

29:05.103 --> 29:06.241
And while
you're at it-

29:06.241 --> 29:07.862
can you ask him if he was
at the TechAdvance party-

29:07.862 --> 29:08.724
Saturday afternoon?

29:08.724 --> 29:09.931
Why- were RJ's
snakes there?

29:09.931 --> 29:11.655
Yeah and Todd
was on their board.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.689
That's good
enough for me.

29:13.689 --> 29:14.482
Can I join you?

29:14.482 --> 29:15.862
I have to make
good on a deal.

29:15.862 --> 29:16.517
Yeah.

29:16.517 --> 29:17.413
Rex, come on.

29:22.172 --> 29:23.931
This is definitely
against protocol.

29:23.931 --> 29:26.172
This is a highly venomous snake
that we're dealing with here.

29:26.172 --> 29:28.103
Well have you handled
a black mamba before?

29:28.103 --> 29:30.379
Because RJ knows Kobe
better than anyone.

29:30.689 --> 29:32.413
I even brought
his favourite snack!

29:33.137 --> 29:33.896
Wharf rat!

29:36.275 --> 29:36.965
Here Kobe!

29:37.724 --> 29:38.758
Here Kobe!

29:39.586 --> 29:41.310
<i>Here Kobe Kobe Kobe!</i>

29:43.724 --> 29:45.344
Did you want to stick
around and supervise?

29:45.344 --> 29:46.206
Oh please,
no no no.

29:46.206 --> 29:47.275
I'm coming with you.

29:49.275 --> 29:50.206
<i>Come on pal.</i>

29:52.068 --> 29:54.827
So what exactly
is Pinnacle offering?

29:55.758 --> 29:57.862
The amount
is 6.2 million.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.896
And a seat on the board
of Pinnacle Games.

29:59.896 --> 30:00.931
That all sounds
pretty good.

30:00.931 --> 30:02.586
Now I just have a couple
of licensing questions.

30:02.586 --> 30:03.241
Detective.

30:03.241 --> 30:04.000
Mm-hmm.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.344
Were we expecting you?

30:15.793 --> 30:16.517
<i>Okay.</i>

30:16.517 --> 30:18.172
Everybody stay very still.

30:18.172 --> 30:19.620
I'll go get RJ.

30:21.034 --> 30:21.655
Rex.

30:21.655 --> 30:22.896
Don't move.

30:30.517 --> 30:31.241
Okay pal.

30:31.241 --> 30:32.310
Easy.

30:40.344 --> 30:40.965
Where is he?

30:40.965 --> 30:41.896
Where's my baby?

30:42.206 --> 30:43.517
Behind the poster.

30:47.517 --> 30:48.241
He's gone.

30:49.344 --> 30:50.551
What? Where
did he go?

30:50.551 --> 30:52.344
<i>Where did
you go, Kobe?</i>

30:54.034 --> 30:55.517
He must have slithered
back into the ventilation-

30:55.517 --> 30:56.931
during all the commotion.

30:56.931 --> 30:58.137
I told you
he was shy!

30:58.137 --> 30:59.689
What do we
do now, RJ?

30:59.689 --> 31:00.827
I'll seal up
the vents-

31:00.827 --> 31:02.931
and see if I can funnel him
back to the event space.

31:05.275 --> 31:05.931
<i>Maybe we can-</i>

31:05.931 --> 31:07.379
reconvene later?

31:07.379 --> 31:08.137
No.

31:08.137 --> 31:09.310
No, that's not necessary.

31:09.310 --> 31:10.034
We're nearly done.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.241
Actually, it is.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.517
I need to have a private
word with you, Todd.

31:21.896 --> 31:22.931
Mind telling me
what's going on?

31:23.482 --> 31:25.379
Let's start with your house
being in foreclosure.

31:26.137 --> 31:28.965
So I'm having some trouble
with financial liquidity.

31:28.965 --> 31:29.965
And?

31:29.965 --> 31:31.379
It might be a motivation
to sell Cottage Games.

31:31.379 --> 31:34.379
I've made no secret of the fact
that I'm pro sale, Detective.

31:34.379 --> 31:35.413
Yeah, but it's
more than that.

31:35.413 --> 31:36.482
You needed the sale.

31:36.482 --> 31:38.206
And Alex was the only
one standing in your way.

31:38.206 --> 31:39.275
Look, even if
that were true-

31:39.275 --> 31:41.310
it's not worth
killing over.

31:41.310 --> 31:42.482
Plus if things
were that bad-

31:42.482 --> 31:43.620
I could have
just cashed out.

31:44.275 --> 31:45.965
Sold my shares
back to the company.

31:45.965 --> 31:47.000
Uh-huh.

31:49.586 --> 31:50.586
Track it, pal.

32:06.103 --> 32:07.620
Where were you between
ten and eleven last night?

32:07.620 --> 32:08.724
At home.

32:08.724 --> 32:09.793
<i>And before you ask-</i>

32:09.793 --> 32:11.620
No, no one can
confirm that.

32:12.724 --> 32:13.551
<i>Oh come on.</i>

32:13.551 --> 32:15.034
Don't you think
if I'd killed Alex-

32:15.034 --> 32:17.206
I'd do a little legwork
to cover my tracks?

32:17.862 --> 32:19.206
You're on the
TechAdvance board.

32:19.206 --> 32:20.000
Is that right?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.068
You were at the
party on Saturday?

32:21.068 --> 32:22.103
What has that
got to do-?

32:22.103 --> 32:23.034
Humour me.

32:23.758 --> 32:24.689
I popped by.

32:25.655 --> 32:26.586
Left around three.

32:26.586 --> 32:28.103
And then drove to
Gander for the night.

32:28.689 --> 32:29.586
Can you prove that?

32:30.206 --> 32:32.172
Give Cobb's
Pond Hotel a call.

32:32.172 --> 32:34.310
I'm sure they can answer any
questions you might have.

32:34.310 --> 32:36.034
You really have all the right
answers, don't you Todd?

32:36.034 --> 32:37.931
Yeah well I do when
I'm telling the truth.

32:37.931 --> 32:39.172
Now if that's everything-

32:39.172 --> 32:42.172
there's a six million dollar
meeting you've interrupted-

32:42.172 --> 32:43.655
that I'd like
to reschedule.

32:48.931 --> 32:50.413
<i>Here Kobe!</i>

32:51.137 --> 32:53.000
Here Kobe Kobe Kobe!

32:55.275 --> 32:56.862
Uh- where did
Animal Control go?

32:56.862 --> 32:57.655
Oh, they left.

32:57.655 --> 32:59.344
They did not
like my methods.

33:00.448 --> 33:02.206
Do you think you can
find Kobe on your own?

33:02.206 --> 33:02.862
Find him?

33:02.862 --> 33:03.965
Sure.

33:03.965 --> 33:05.931
Capturing him might be
another matter altogether.

33:07.724 --> 33:10.896
The pathologist on my team
is an amateur herpetologist.

33:10.896 --> 33:12.034
She might be
able to help.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.344
Well I'll appreciate any
extra hands I can get.

33:14.344 --> 33:16.517
But I did have
someone else in mind.

33:18.275 --> 33:19.137
Me?

33:19.379 --> 33:20.068
Oh no no no.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.379
You've got
to be kidding.

33:21.379 --> 33:22.965
You got along so
well with Mr. Noodles.

33:22.965 --> 33:25.310
I'm sure you'll
love Kobe, too.

33:30.413 --> 33:31.275
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

33:31.896 --> 33:32.655
<i>Hey Charlie.</i>

33:32.655 --> 33:34.172
How'd things
go with Todd?

33:34.172 --> 33:35.103
Frustratingly.

33:35.103 --> 33:36.517
The guy
is so cocky.

33:37.310 --> 33:38.275
Hey Jesse.

33:38.965 --> 33:39.931
What did
his hotel say?

33:39.931 --> 33:41.965
Well he checked in at
00 pm on Saturday.

33:41.965 --> 33:42.827
Didn't leave his room-

33:42.827 --> 33:44.655
until 2:00 pm at
checkout the next day.

33:44.655 --> 33:45.793
So he didn't
steal the snake.

33:45.793 --> 33:46.724
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:46.724 --> 33:49.103
And Rex didn't track
the fabric to him.

33:49.103 --> 33:50.827
But something tells me
that he's involved in this.

33:53.310 --> 33:54.137
Hey Sarah.

33:54.137 --> 33:55.413
What's up?

33:56.034 --> 33:56.655
Yeah.

33:56.655 --> 33:57.379
I'll be right there.

33:58.482 --> 33:59.344
Everything okay?

34:00.103 --> 34:01.413
Yeah, Sarah and
Karma figured out-

34:01.413 --> 34:03.103
how the snake
got into the office.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.000
Rex.

34:05.103 --> 34:06.241
Come on pal.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.896
That's Kobe's carrying case.

34:13.896 --> 34:15.137
I found it near
the kitchenette.

34:18.275 --> 34:19.206
<i>What've
you got, Rex?</i>

34:31.172 --> 34:32.103
FoodGo.

34:32.517 --> 34:33.793
Steve Sader
works for them.

34:34.827 --> 34:36.724
The former employee who
claimed he invented Snakepit?

34:36.724 --> 34:38.379
I thought he had an
alibi for the murder.

34:38.379 --> 34:39.137
Yeah, he does.

34:39.137 --> 34:40.172
But something
doesn't add up.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.655
Rex was here
less an hour ago.

34:42.655 --> 34:45.172
Why didn't he find
it then, unless- ?

34:45.172 --> 34:46.896
Someone planted
it after that.

34:57.482 --> 34:58.275
Hey.

34:59.275 --> 35:00.620
Sarah checked this
for fingerprints.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.344
Todd's aren't on it.

35:01.344 --> 35:03.000
But Steve's are.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.689
Steve has an alibi
for the murder.

35:04.689 --> 35:07.344
But I mean, people he delivered
to between ten and eleven-

35:07.344 --> 35:08.620
described
him to a tee.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.482
You said Todd doesn't have
an alibi for the murder, right?

35:10.482 --> 35:11.413
Uh-huh.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.586
So what if they were
working together?

35:12.586 --> 35:14.068
I mean that's
what I was thinking.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.241
But-

35:15.241 --> 35:17.655
<i>I don't understand why Todd
would want to kill Alex-</i>

35:17.655 --> 35:19.000
<i>in such an
obvious way.</i>

35:19.000 --> 35:20.482
Maybe it runs
deeper than business?

35:20.482 --> 35:22.034
I mean, Alex was
a bit of an alpha.

35:22.034 --> 35:23.689
I'd say the same
about Todd.

35:24.482 --> 35:26.206
Maybe it was just
about getting the win?

35:26.206 --> 35:27.793
How do we prove
something like that?

35:32.344 --> 35:34.068
We start with Steve.

35:39.724 --> 35:40.413
Come on, partner.

35:45.689 --> 35:46.896
Let's try this
again shall we?

35:47.655 --> 35:48.413
Track it.

35:54.103 --> 35:55.827
Want to tell me
what I'm doing here?

35:55.827 --> 35:57.034
Well for starters-

35:57.034 --> 35:59.172
<i>Rex just confirmed
that you're the person-</i>

35:59.172 --> 36:01.103
<i>who stole the snake
that killed Alex Davies.</i>

36:01.103 --> 36:02.068
Sit down!

36:04.034 --> 36:06.379
We found this near where
Alex's body was discovered.

36:06.379 --> 36:08.172
<i>You want to tell
me how it got there?</i>

36:09.482 --> 36:10.724
A lot of
FoodGo couriers.

36:10.724 --> 36:12.034
Maybe one of them-

36:12.034 --> 36:12.896
<i>Steve!</i>

36:12.896 --> 36:14.827
Your fingerprints
are all over this.

36:14.827 --> 36:16.965
You're about to be
charged with murder.

36:19.655 --> 36:20.551
I-

36:21.379 --> 36:22.517
I didn't kill Alex.

36:26.689 --> 36:27.586
I want to
believe you.

36:28.172 --> 36:28.827
I do.

36:29.758 --> 36:30.965
I'm going to need
a little help here.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.862
Like I said, I've
got no idea-

36:34.862 --> 36:35.965
<i>Cut the crap okay?</i>

36:35.965 --> 36:37.275
You stole the snake!

36:37.275 --> 36:38.344
You put it
in the bag!

36:38.344 --> 36:39.275
You took it
to somebody!

36:39.275 --> 36:40.448
That somebody
used it to kill Alex!

36:40.448 --> 36:41.448
<i>Who was it?</i>

36:44.517 --> 36:45.793
<i>You understand-</i>

36:45.793 --> 36:47.758
that this person planted this
bag so that we would find it.

36:47.758 --> 36:49.344
They're trying
to sewer you!

36:55.310 --> 36:56.000
You know what?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.137
I'm not going to
waste my time.

36:57.137 --> 36:58.206
<i>Wait, I-</i>

37:02.206 --> 37:02.862
It-

37:03.310 --> 37:04.413
It was Todd Harvey.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.379
He said if I did
this one thing-

37:07.379 --> 37:08.310
he'd fund
my new game.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.827
I've been trying so
long to get a break.

37:10.827 --> 37:12.206
And you hated Alex.

37:12.206 --> 37:13.275
I didn't want
him dead.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.620
I thought Todd was just
going to play a prank.

37:15.620 --> 37:16.689
Do you have
any proof?

37:17.758 --> 37:18.379
Emails?

37:18.379 --> 37:19.275
Text messages?

37:20.241 --> 37:21.517
He didn't want
anything in writing.

37:21.517 --> 37:23.103
What about when you
handed off the snake?

37:23.103 --> 37:24.068
Was there anyone
else there?

37:24.620 --> 37:25.310
No.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.241
We met late
one night-

37:27.241 --> 37:29.517
at the parking garage
down on Duckworth.

37:33.931 --> 37:35.724
Your signature
here and here.

37:35.724 --> 37:36.586
<i>Okay.</i>

37:37.655 --> 37:39.068
You may want to
hold off on that.

37:40.517 --> 37:41.758
<i>Todd Harvey.</i>

37:42.827 --> 37:45.034
You're under arrest for
the murder of Alex Davies.

37:45.137 --> 37:45.896
What?

37:46.241 --> 37:47.103
Todd, what is he- ?

37:47.103 --> 37:49.103
Please- I did
nothing of the sort.

37:49.103 --> 37:50.586
Might've gotten
away with it too-

37:50.586 --> 37:52.586
if you didn't try
and plant that bag.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.448
<i>You know, Steve-</i>

37:54.448 --> 37:56.137
he's not too happy
you tried to frame him.

37:56.137 --> 37:58.586
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:58.586 --> 37:59.965
You needed cash.

38:01.137 --> 38:02.655
<i>You could have sold
your shares to get it.</i>

38:02.655 --> 38:04.103
<i>But you didn't.</i>

38:04.103 --> 38:04.758
<i>That would mean-</i>

38:04.758 --> 38:06.034
admitting failure.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.275
And the thought of losing
to Alex drove you crazy.

38:08.379 --> 38:10.965
Well, you've got quite an
imagination, Detective.

38:10.965 --> 38:11.862
I'll give you that.

38:11.862 --> 38:13.482
Seeing RJ's snakes
at the party-

38:13.482 --> 38:14.896
it gave you
an idea.

38:14.896 --> 38:16.827
<i>But you needed
plausible deniability.</i>

38:16.827 --> 38:17.862
<i>That's where
Steve came in.</i>

38:17.862 --> 38:20.172
This is pure speculation.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.137
Except it's not.

38:23.206 --> 38:25.379
This is you with the
bag holding the snake-

38:25.379 --> 38:26.724
<i>that killed Alex.</i>

38:26.724 --> 38:28.275
<i>You didn't count on there
being security cameras-</i>

38:28.275 --> 38:30.379
<i>in the Duckworth
parking garage.</i>

38:30.896 --> 38:31.551
This-

38:31.551 --> 38:33.206
<i>with Steve's statement-</i>

38:33.206 --> 38:34.724
<i>I have a feeling
that the Crown-</i>

38:34.724 --> 38:35.758
<i>is going to have
no problem-</i>

38:35.758 --> 38:36.551
bringing
this to trial.

38:46.655 --> 38:47.344
Rex!

38:52.241 --> 38:53.137
Excuse me!

38:55.344 --> 38:56.517
What the hell
is going on?

38:56.517 --> 38:57.827
We found our
snake, Markus.

38:59.310 --> 39:00.310
What?

39:03.482 --> 39:07.310
Is it possible the snake got
out of the building somehow?

39:07.310 --> 39:08.655
Oh I sure
hope not.

39:09.034 --> 39:10.896
What would the poor
thing do for food out there-

39:10.896 --> 39:12.413
all alone in
the world?

39:13.724 --> 39:15.793
I don't think we need
to worry about that.

39:18.862 --> 39:19.793
My boy!

39:20.724 --> 39:22.000
<i>Stay calm, Sarah.</i>

39:22.000 --> 39:24.586
The Black Mamba is the fastest
moving land snake in the world.

39:24.586 --> 39:26.137
And we do not
want to scare it now.

39:26.137 --> 39:28.172
Okay now
you tell me.

39:33.344 --> 39:34.137
Ughh!

39:34.793 --> 39:35.551
What the- ?

39:54.517 --> 39:55.172
<i>Ugh!</i>

39:58.206 --> 39:59.103
<i>Ughh!</i>

40:02.793 --> 40:03.517
Sorry Todd!

40:04.275 --> 40:05.103
You lose!

40:07.896 --> 40:08.827
RJ, Karma.

40:08.827 --> 40:09.931
I could use
your help here.

40:14.241 --> 40:15.206
Rex!

40:20.172 --> 40:21.068
Stay back!

40:21.724 --> 40:22.413
Rex!

40:23.344 --> 40:24.172
It's okay.

40:26.068 --> 40:26.896
I've got this.

40:43.517 --> 40:44.793
Rex speak.

40:54.482 --> 40:55.793
Easy.

41:00.896 --> 41:03.655
Oh my gosh!

41:03.758 --> 41:04.310
I did it.

41:04.310 --> 41:05.206
I got it.

41:05.206 --> 41:07.241
What a way to
conquer your fear!

41:07.241 --> 41:09.034
Okay somebody please
get this from me please!

41:30.689 --> 41:31.551
Good teamwork, Rex.

41:36.103 --> 41:38.137
<i>♪Get up,
shake it off♪</i>

41:38.241 --> 41:42.034
<i>♪It's been way
too long enough♪</i>

41:42.034 --> 41:44.275
<i>♪I've been watching
you getting soft♪</i>

41:44.275 --> 41:45.310
Because he helped
find Kobe-

41:45.310 --> 41:46.206
thank you-

41:46.206 --> 41:47.517
the Department of
Wildlife has agreed-

41:47.517 --> 41:50.344
to let RJ amend the paperwork
for his reptile park.

41:50.344 --> 41:52.482
So his snakes should
be returned to him soon.

41:52.482 --> 41:53.517
Wow!

41:53.517 --> 41:55.448
From a phobic to snake
advocate in one case.

41:55.448 --> 41:56.275
What's next?

41:56.275 --> 41:57.827
Are you going to
get one as a pet?

41:59.620 --> 42:00.793
Oh don't worry, Rex.

42:00.793 --> 42:02.241
Just because I faced
my fear of snakes-

42:02.241 --> 42:04.896
does not mean I
want to own any.

42:06.655 --> 42:07.793
Oh!

42:07.793 --> 42:10.827
Is it true that Markus and
Raya are creating a game-

42:10.827 --> 42:13.310
based on a K9 and
his human partner?

42:13.310 --> 42:15.413
Yeah, so they say.

42:15.413 --> 42:16.275
They're keeping the company.

42:16.275 --> 42:17.310
And-

42:17.310 --> 42:18.758
Hudson & Rex is going
to be their first game.

42:18.758 --> 42:19.448
Right buddy?

42:19.448 --> 42:20.931
You sure about
that name?

42:22.206 --> 42:22.965
<i>Speaking of games-</i>

42:23.068 --> 42:23.931
Snakepit!

42:23.931 --> 42:24.793
Figured I'd
bring it back!

42:24.793 --> 42:26.206
We could pick up
where we left off!

42:26.206 --> 42:28.068
I believe I
was winning.

42:28.068 --> 42:30.068
<i>No,
not so fast Jesse.</i>

42:30.068 --> 42:31.586
You've got some
explaining to do.

42:31.586 --> 42:32.275
Why?

42:32.275 --> 42:33.586
What is that?

42:33.586 --> 42:35.137
<i>That's 27 matches!</i>

42:35.137 --> 42:36.896
That was really fast!

42:36.896 --> 42:38.413
You signed me up
for online dating?

42:38.413 --> 42:40.344
<i>Yeah, if you
just give it a try-</i>

42:40.344 --> 42:41.551
No, I'm not
giving it a try.

42:41.551 --> 42:42.551
Delete it and
delete it now.

42:42.551 --> 42:43.241
Let me see.

42:43.241 --> 42:44.034
Oh no she's cute!

42:44.034 --> 42:44.827
Right?

42:46.896 --> 42:48.103
Her too!

42:48.103 --> 42:50.793
Wow, whatever Jesse wrote
must've been good!

42:51.448 --> 42:52.103
Look.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.620
This one
has a PhD.

42:55.448 --> 42:56.379
Hmm!

42:56.482 --> 42:57.482
<i>You know, on
second thought-</i>

42:57.482 --> 42:59.379
maybe I should
give this a try!

42:59.379 --> 43:00.724
I believe what
you mean is-

43:00.724 --> 43:01.586
<i>Thank you, Jesse!</i>

43:01.586 --> 43:02.275
Yeah you're welcome, Jesse.

43:02.275 --> 43:02.965
Thanks.

43:02.965 --> 43:03.620
Charlie?

43:03.620 --> 43:04.275
Are you sure?

43:04.275 --> 43:05.000
Because-

43:06.517 --> 43:07.517
Sarah?

43:09.034 --> 43:10.034
All right!
