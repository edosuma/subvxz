02:52.000 --> 02:53.789
Good morning, Quark.

02:55.585 --> 02:58.432
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara...

02:58.496 --> 03:01.344
to ask me if I had
a date to the dance.

03:01.408 --> 03:03.742
No, they broke up for
religious differences.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.394
She thought she was God
and he disagreed.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.709
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.

03:10.785 --> 03:13.370
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.131
Maybe. Yeah.

03:17.024 --> 03:20.766
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around
a while and keep an eye on Nick.

03:20.832 --> 03:23.800
He likes to take things apart.

03:23.872 --> 03:28.694
Well, that's why I watch it at your
house. Things'll cool off after today.

03:28.768 --> 03:31.452
Dad has his big
show-and-tell at the lab.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.487
Zap!

03:34.560 --> 03:38.073
- It works! L-It really works!
- Nick, get real.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.240
The subject has disappeared.

03:41.311 --> 03:43.799
No, no, it's not that.

03:43.872 --> 03:47.702
No. Mom and Dad had
an argument last night...

03:47.776 --> 03:49.631
and Mom spent the night
at Grandma's.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.584
I think she just needed a rest.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.623
Right, her and me both.

03:53.695 --> 03:57.111
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.

04:02.079 --> 04:05.113
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

04:05.184 --> 04:08.533
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

04:11.679 --> 04:14.200
If only Dad could get
that machine to work.

04:35.616 --> 04:37.470
Breakfast.

04:38.815 --> 04:40.986
I need a couple minutes here.

04:44.479 --> 04:49.335
"I'll be down in five minutes."

04:49.408 --> 04:51.415
Typing with his gloves on again.

05:18.815 --> 05:21.466
Oh, no, not again!

05:21.535 --> 05:25.113
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?

05:26.719 --> 05:31.323
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!

05:31.391 --> 05:35.515
It's construction, honey. You of
all people should understand that.

05:35.583 --> 05:40.569
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

05:40.639 --> 05:42.843
And I think he should have
consideration for other people.

05:42.911 --> 05:45.660
Mm, give the guy a break.

05:45.727 --> 05:49.851
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm!

05:49.919 --> 05:51.512
Honey!

05:53.279 --> 05:55.188
Szalinski!

05:55.262 --> 05:57.204
But, honey, you are
much bigger than he is.

05:57.278 --> 06:00.028
Szalinski!

06:00.095 --> 06:02.462
- Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.

06:02.527 --> 06:04.382
- Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.967
- Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod!

06:07.967 --> 06:10.236
Stop! Dad!

06:12.767 --> 06:15.669
- Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.710
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

06:18.783 --> 06:22.776
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?
- Gotta mark those trespassers, Dad.

06:22.846 --> 06:26.195
- I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father!
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.

06:26.271 --> 06:28.409
- Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

06:28.478 --> 06:30.934
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

06:31.006 --> 06:33.428
- Attila the Hun was
12 once, too, you know.
- Oh, come on.

06:35.742 --> 06:37.597
He's sounding.

06:40.223 --> 06:42.776
Weird family.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.401
Dad?

06:57.470 --> 07:00.405
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?

07:00.478 --> 07:04.472
- That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.

07:04.542 --> 07:08.219
- If you took all the
molecules in this house...
- Listen, Nick, I gotta get
this working before I leave.

07:08.286 --> 07:10.555
Why don't you go help your sister?

07:51.614 --> 07:53.850
Stay back, boy.
This thing works...

07:53.918 --> 07:56.700
this'll put us up there with
the invention of electricity...

07:56.766 --> 07:59.548
first man in space.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.523
First dog in space.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.353
Come on! Shrink!

08:11.422 --> 08:13.910
Shrink!

08:20.285 --> 08:22.489
Please, please, shrink.

08:22.557 --> 08:24.248
Please, shrink.

08:38.173 --> 08:42.363
On the other hand, we've come up with an
interesting way of making applesauce.

08:46.429 --> 08:49.080
- You got it, honey.
- Sure?
- Positive.

08:49.149 --> 08:53.208
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

08:53.277 --> 08:58.099
- Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.

08:58.173 --> 09:00.027
Darn right.

09:01.852 --> 09:04.820
Well, look who's decided to
join the land of the living.

09:04.893 --> 09:07.511
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

09:07.581 --> 09:10.298
- Not really, Dad.
- Not really?

09:10.365 --> 09:13.212
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

09:13.276 --> 09:15.546
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.

09:18.493 --> 09:20.980
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?

09:21.052 --> 09:25.176
There... I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

09:25.244 --> 09:28.593
Russell, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was cut from
the football team yesterday.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.833
- What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't
need right now is to hear from you.

09:31.901 --> 09:34.650
- He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...
- Captain of the team.

09:34.717 --> 09:37.172
And if my father'd wanted me to go on
a fishing trip, I would've been gra...

09:37.245 --> 09:39.962
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.

09:40.029 --> 09:42.647
He is not too small for football!

09:42.717 --> 09:45.400
Honey, when you say things like that,
you make him feel about this big.

09:45.468 --> 09:48.697
If he wants to feel big,
he should act big.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.737
Elbows up.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.147
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.

10:01.213 --> 10:03.155
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.

10:05.468 --> 10:08.119
Here, Quark.

10:11.004 --> 10:13.721
Eat it, Dad,
before it gets cold.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.303
Mm, did you get
the machine to work?

10:21.373 --> 10:24.471
Yeah. A few more bugs
to get out, but...

10:24.540 --> 10:28.599
<i>- What about the conference?
- Meow.</i>

10:28.668 --> 10:30.708
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

10:31.740 --> 10:35.384
Dad! Dad, wait. Dad!

10:35.452 --> 10:37.591
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

10:37.660 --> 10:40.115
Dad, don't forget my dress from
the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...

10:40.188 --> 10:42.130
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.

10:42.204 --> 10:45.400
Wish me luck. I need luck
getting out of this door.

10:51.740 --> 10:54.675
- House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.

10:54.748 --> 10:56.635
<i>Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.</i>

10:56.699 --> 10:59.121
He's just leaving
for the conference.

10:59.196 --> 11:01.585
Dad, it's Mom.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.699
- Where?
- On the phone.

11:03.771 --> 11:05.746
- Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?

11:05.820 --> 11:09.714
- Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.

11:09.787 --> 11:12.569
- Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.

11:12.636 --> 11:14.610
I'm gonna meet him at
the mall later today.

11:14.683 --> 11:16.690
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.552
<i>- Hiya.
- Hi.
- Nick!</i>

11:18.620 --> 11:22.581
- I called to wish you luck
at the conference.
- Look, Diane, if things go well...

11:22.652 --> 11:25.270
this morning, everything'll change
around here, I promise you.

11:25.340 --> 11:28.023
<i>Okay. I have
a house to show...</i>

11:28.091 --> 11:30.295
and then I'll be home this
afternoon and we'll talk.

11:30.363 --> 11:34.225
<i>- Good luck today.
- Thanks. Bye, honey.</i>

11:34.299 --> 11:38.194
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make
this place spick-and-span, okay?

11:38.268 --> 11:40.918
Nick, I want you to
mow the lawn. Amy...

11:43.867 --> 11:46.039
good luck.

11:56.219 --> 11:59.285
I'm helping my Dad with this
real important new invention.

11:59.355 --> 12:02.038
So, mm...

12:02.107 --> 12:04.977
I'll... I'll let you
mow half my yard.

12:05.052 --> 12:06.480
No, thanks.

12:08.635 --> 12:10.490
Wow! With that?

12:10.555 --> 12:12.410
Yeah...

12:12.475 --> 12:14.068
and...

12:14.139 --> 12:15.994
this.

12:18.011 --> 12:20.018
Oh, it's a remote control!

12:22.523 --> 12:25.589
Tell you what. You thrown in
a box of cookies...

12:25.659 --> 12:28.081
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

12:28.155 --> 12:30.872
Uh, but I have to go
and meet Newt right now.

12:32.859 --> 12:35.128
Uh, could I do it later?

12:35.195 --> 12:38.064
- I don't think so, because, you know,
my Dad's gonna come home and...
- Aw, come on.

12:39.866 --> 12:43.063
- Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.

12:43.131 --> 12:45.619
- No problem.
- See you later!

12:51.675 --> 12:54.293
Nothin' like a hard day's work.

12:58.331 --> 13:00.185
French fries.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.436
Tater Sticks.

13:04.507 --> 13:07.092
Meat loaf.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.301
Veal "parmedjian."

13:09.371 --> 13:11.226
Hey, Dad, wanna go
play some baseball?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.040
Hmm, baseball.

13:14.107 --> 13:18.067
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

13:18.138 --> 13:20.888
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

13:36.922 --> 13:40.631
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

13:40.699 --> 13:43.033
Nope.

13:43.098 --> 13:46.164
- Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.

13:47.706 --> 13:50.740
- Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald!

13:50.810 --> 13:52.817
Lug your stuff.

13:52.890 --> 13:54.745
Later, worm.

14:01.306 --> 14:03.990
Russell, gimme a hand here.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.757
Russell! Gimme a hand here.

14:10.426 --> 14:13.273
Dad, it's early.

14:13.338 --> 14:16.208
The early worm catches
the fish, Russell.

14:17.337 --> 14:19.093
Remember that.

14:20.122 --> 14:23.667
The Forresters are coming by after
lunch, so come on! Quick march!

14:42.426 --> 14:47.314
<i>Something here between us
is something that I can't resist</i>

14:50.106 --> 14:55.092
<i>Aphysical attraction
Feel it every time we kiss</i>

14:55.162 --> 14:57.104
Weird family.

14:57.178 --> 15:01.782
<i>Oh, you got me so excited
Still it's not enough</i>

15:01.849 --> 15:06.519
<i>I'm gonna try to fight it
till I know if this is love</i>

15:06.586 --> 15:08.528
<i>Turn it up</i>

15:08.602 --> 15:11.733
<i>- Yeah!
- Turn it up, ooh hoo</i>

15:13.050 --> 15:15.471
<i>I love to hear</i>

15:16.889 --> 15:18.166
Russell...

15:20.026 --> 15:22.808
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today...

15:22.873 --> 15:27.695
but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.

15:27.769 --> 15:31.314
- I know, Dad. You've told me
about a million times.
- All right. Just hear me out.

15:31.385 --> 15:34.582
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.

15:34.649 --> 15:38.871
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds
of pure, unadulterated...

15:38.937 --> 15:42.166
blitz-the-quarterback
and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

15:42.233 --> 15:47.121
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months...

15:47.193 --> 15:50.641
you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster...

15:50.713 --> 15:53.527
and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

16:15.512 --> 16:18.741
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.

16:20.472 --> 16:23.789
Um, Dad, you... you know that
weights aren't my thing.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.572
Fishing isn't your thing.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.804
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

16:33.464 --> 16:36.977
I don't know, but I'll
keep you posted, okay?

16:37.048 --> 16:40.693
Fine. Until you do,
you're trying these.

16:40.761 --> 16:44.438
And you're coming fishing
with the family. Is that clear?

16:44.505 --> 16:47.025
I can't hear you!

16:47.096 --> 16:49.649
Yes, sir.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.989
Better.

16:52.056 --> 16:55.372
Now, uh, lift with your legs,
not with your back.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.568
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

17:19.448 --> 17:21.869
Russell, you're not smoking
a cigarette, are you?

17:21.944 --> 17:24.116
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

17:37.496 --> 17:39.885
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.367
- Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?
- Tubular!

17:44.439 --> 17:48.018
He's only 12, and he's already
thinking about construction.

17:48.088 --> 17:52.397
- Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.348
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of
the ninth. It's a clutch situation.

18:03.416 --> 18:08.271
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.

18:08.343 --> 18:10.929
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh!

18:11.000 --> 18:13.455
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

18:13.528 --> 18:16.561
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.

18:16.631 --> 18:18.224
Grand...

18:20.504 --> 18:22.446
slam.

18:25.847 --> 18:27.757
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

18:27.832 --> 18:30.963
- Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.
Nobody saw it but you.

18:31.031 --> 18:34.195
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.

18:34.263 --> 18:37.362
You're not supposed to fink
on your own brother!

18:37.432 --> 18:40.082
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that
you spend your allowance on... Uuh!

18:40.151 --> 18:42.006
Come on, Russ!

18:43.127 --> 18:45.975
Look, either you tell them
or I tell them, okay?

18:47.479 --> 18:49.334
Okay. You tell 'em.

19:05.175 --> 19:08.688
- Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...
- Tell them.

19:08.759 --> 19:13.015
- What's going on?
- Hi. Um...

19:13.079 --> 19:15.981
l-I'm Russ Thompson
from next door, uh...

19:16.055 --> 19:17.713
Um...

19:17.783 --> 19:20.914
Uh, my brother has something to
tell you, or else I could tell her.

19:20.983 --> 19:24.114
Okay! See, I was playing
with my ball, right?

19:24.183 --> 19:26.419
Well... Well, actually,
it's not my ball exactly.

19:26.487 --> 19:28.210
- It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.

19:28.279 --> 19:31.595
It never would've happened
if their house wasn't so close!

19:31.671 --> 19:34.060
- He hit a baseball
through your attic window.
- He what?

19:34.134 --> 19:37.102
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day!

19:37.175 --> 19:40.786
- We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take
it out of his allowance, all right?
- My allowance? Dream on.

19:40.854 --> 19:43.407
Okay, we'll just have
Dad pay for it, huh?

19:43.478 --> 19:45.583
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.

19:45.654 --> 19:48.404
Until you pay,
no man shall pass.

19:48.471 --> 19:52.661
- You got nothin' to say
about it, space boy!
- Cool it!

19:52.726 --> 19:55.596
Nick, take him upstairs and get him
his ball. And clean up the mess.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.834
- What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't
have time to mess around.

20:00.822 --> 20:04.816
Come on. This is what's wrong with
the American system of justice.

20:05.847 --> 20:09.425
So, y... You like to dance, huh?

20:11.030 --> 20:14.379
- How do you know?
- Well...

20:14.454 --> 20:16.309
- You could see me?
- No.

20:16.374 --> 20:20.269
Uh, no, l... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. L...

20:24.150 --> 20:25.710
Awesome.

20:25.782 --> 20:28.302
So your Dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

20:39.478 --> 20:41.747
And given that my machine can
substantially reduce...

20:41.814 --> 20:47.182
the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies...

20:47.254 --> 20:49.937
the savings to the space program
would be staggering.

20:50.006 --> 20:52.210
Mr. Szalinski, are you
trying to tell me that...

20:52.278 --> 20:54.700
suddenly size is
no longer relative?

20:54.774 --> 20:56.846
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is...

20:56.918 --> 20:59.122
made up of not only density,
but of empty space.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.557
<i>And if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space...</i>

21:01.622 --> 21:04.372
in any given object, we can
thereby shrink the object.

21:04.438 --> 21:07.405
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?

21:07.478 --> 21:10.926
When Einstein came up with
the atomic bomb, did they ask
him to prove that it worked?

21:10.998 --> 21:14.064
You, Mr. Szalinski,
are hardly Einstein.

21:16.182 --> 21:19.477
- I picked a name.
- You have, however,
managed to shrink one thing...

21:19.542 --> 21:21.713
the size of this audience.

21:21.782 --> 21:25.579
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know
about you, but I'm going to lunch.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.513
Wayne. Wayne.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.388
- Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

21:38.454 --> 21:41.901
It will take time to convince
people without proof.

21:41.973 --> 21:43.981
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

21:45.621 --> 21:48.272
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.196
The extension cord was a bad idea.

21:51.125 --> 21:56.111
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.

21:57.269 --> 21:59.124
Nick!

22:01.685 --> 22:03.758
- Nick...
- Ron?
- If you guys are hiding up here...

22:03.830 --> 22:05.902
it's not funny.

22:05.973 --> 22:08.112
Nick, you know what Dad said.

22:08.181 --> 22:11.115
You're not supposed
to be playing up here.

22:24.854 --> 22:27.275
Where are we?

22:38.261 --> 22:39.821
God, what happened?

22:39.893 --> 22:41.519
- Amy!
- Russ!

22:41.589 --> 22:44.938
Amy!

22:45.013 --> 22:46.923
- Nicky.
- Ron?

22:50.101 --> 22:52.589
- Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers!

22:56.533 --> 22:58.835
Be quiet, Quark!

23:00.821 --> 23:03.407
- Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball!

23:03.477 --> 23:05.582
- Shut up, wimp!
- We have to get Dad.

23:05.653 --> 23:07.595
He'll know what to do.

23:10.517 --> 23:13.713
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

23:20.436 --> 23:22.770
Can somebody get that?

23:22.837 --> 23:25.422
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.392
Amy? Nick?

23:33.461 --> 23:35.316
Hello?

23:38.357 --> 23:40.113
It's not for you.

23:43.092 --> 23:45.481
What is it, Quark?

23:45.556 --> 23:47.760
Nick!

23:47.828 --> 23:49.683
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?

23:49.748 --> 23:51.919
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

23:51.988 --> 23:54.476
Mr. Szalinski! Up here!

23:54.548 --> 23:57.036
- Up here, Dad!
- Quick, over there by the door.

23:57.109 --> 23:59.596
- Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?

23:59.668 --> 24:02.221
- Nick!
- Get off and give us a hand!

24:03.796 --> 24:05.738
Nick? Amy?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.233
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

24:08.308 --> 24:11.570
- Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack!

24:16.788 --> 24:19.406
Hurry up. He's coming!

24:31.827 --> 24:34.610
- Right here!
- Szalinski!
- Dad! Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

24:36.052 --> 24:37.514
- Down here!
- Help!

24:46.131 --> 24:49.066
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!

24:56.339 --> 24:58.128
Where's my couch?

25:03.155 --> 25:05.010
What is he, deaf?

25:05.075 --> 25:08.391
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.

25:13.236 --> 25:14.577
Dad!

25:21.236 --> 25:23.091
I don't believe this.

25:24.627 --> 25:26.482
What a day.

25:26.547 --> 25:28.402
Ow!

25:30.099 --> 25:32.750
This is all your fault!

25:32.819 --> 25:34.674
- Five years...
- No, Dad, it works!

25:34.739 --> 25:36.910
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No! Mr. Szalinski!
- Dad!

25:36.979 --> 25:38.834
You don't even work!

25:42.708 --> 25:44.813
Don't!

25:44.884 --> 25:46.771
- Run!
- Run.

25:48.787 --> 25:51.634
Run, Nicky! Keep up!

25:54.739 --> 25:55.884
Dad!

26:01.747 --> 26:05.391
Stay there!
There's glass everywhere here now.

26:11.219 --> 26:13.553
- No!
- Dad! Run, Nicky!

26:13.619 --> 26:16.434
No! Back the other way!

26:29.395 --> 26:30.988
Go!

26:32.850 --> 26:34.923
- Help!
- Help!

26:43.762 --> 26:46.184
No!

26:49.778 --> 26:52.561
Help! Somebody!

27:15.090 --> 27:17.000
Not now, Quark.

27:17.874 --> 27:21.169
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash
the same day they get ours?

27:21.235 --> 27:22.761
Ow! Nick?

27:22.834 --> 27:25.933
- I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?

27:26.002 --> 27:28.653
I don't know, but I'm not waitin'
around to find out. Move over.

27:28.722 --> 27:31.405
- Ow! Watch it!
- Look out.

27:44.242 --> 27:46.216
Oh, my God.

27:48.146 --> 27:50.186
Reminds me of the backyard.

27:52.050 --> 27:54.668
Something tells me we're
not going fishing this weekend.

27:54.737 --> 27:58.218
- That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.330
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?

28:00.401 --> 28:03.085
L... I think so.

28:03.154 --> 28:06.318
- Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.

28:06.386 --> 28:10.958
I'm never goin' back to your house!
I'm goin' home.

28:11.026 --> 28:13.676
Come on, Russ.

28:16.146 --> 28:18.699
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

28:18.770 --> 28:22.381
- Could your Dad help us?
- Russ! We're supposed to go fishing!

28:22.450 --> 28:24.522
Yeah, right!
How are you going, as bait?

28:26.258 --> 28:28.429
What a witch!

28:40.210 --> 28:43.079
Russ, you comin' down, or what?

28:43.153 --> 28:45.160
Well, we can't stay here.

28:46.833 --> 28:50.477
Well, I think we should
stick together.

28:50.545 --> 28:52.553
Well, come on.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.560
Nicky!

29:19.441 --> 29:22.637
I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore, Toto.

29:22.705 --> 29:26.120
I don't think we're in
the food chain anymore, Dorothy.

29:31.985 --> 29:33.774
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.

29:33.841 --> 29:38.216
What? You let a girl
tell you what to do?

29:38.289 --> 29:40.710
Look, Ron, down here,
you're gonna listen to me.

29:40.785 --> 29:44.680
From now on, you're gonna
do what I say! Run!

30:00.689 --> 30:03.689
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.478
Knock it off, Ron.

30:06.545 --> 30:08.934
We're now a quarter
of an inch tall...

30:09.009 --> 30:12.238
and 64 feet from the house.

30:12.305 --> 30:15.982
That's the equivalent
of 3.2 miles.

30:16.049 --> 30:18.864
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

30:18.929 --> 30:23.664
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,
get big and get to the mall.

30:23.729 --> 30:25.583
Now get moving!

30:27.632 --> 30:31.658
That butterfly had
a wingspan of 42 feet!

30:31.728 --> 30:32.840
Nick!

30:47.312 --> 30:49.068
Hi.

30:49.136 --> 30:50.598
Hi.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.999
- Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...

30:54.064 --> 30:56.039
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!

30:56.112 --> 30:59.178
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.704
I only had to show it
to them 12 times.

31:01.776 --> 31:05.606
- How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.785
- Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.

31:07.856 --> 31:12.012
L-l... I'm just gonna get my old job
back, if I can get my old job back.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.349
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.270
Different.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.214
Right.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.292
- Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them
since I left this morning.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.615
- Well, did you tell
them I was coming home?
- Yeah, that's why
they cleaned things up.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.745
I see. Oh, they're probably
just at the mall.

31:35.535 --> 31:38.023
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

31:39.056 --> 31:41.358
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

31:49.999 --> 31:53.131
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags us...

31:54.832 --> 31:58.280
Nick, don't you ever
pick up your toys?

31:58.352 --> 32:01.963
- What a wimp!
- Been looking for that guy.

32:05.519 --> 32:08.967
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.

32:09.039 --> 32:14.440
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,
but it's years to the rest of the world?

32:14.511 --> 32:17.097
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.688
Impossible. Time doesn't exist,
except as a...

32:19.759 --> 32:22.923
- Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?

32:22.991 --> 32:27.246
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,
and it'd look like a river to us.

32:29.327 --> 32:31.946
Let's swim it.

32:34.767 --> 32:38.062
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

32:39.855 --> 32:42.058
Hey! Hey, if we could
get some rope...

32:42.128 --> 32:44.135
we could make a log bridge!

32:45.999 --> 32:48.006
If... If we... If we had some logs.

32:52.335 --> 32:54.058
- Quark!
- Your dog?

32:54.127 --> 32:56.516
- Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.

32:56.591 --> 32:58.533
Yeah, he can!
Dogs have great ears.

32:58.607 --> 33:01.738
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

33:01.807 --> 33:03.662
Whistle.

33:15.951 --> 33:17.893
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

33:21.839 --> 33:23.694
Let's get higher up.

33:26.927 --> 33:30.855
You know how to whistle. You just
put your lips together and blow.

33:40.207 --> 33:43.174
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.668
Let's climb.

33:51.726 --> 33:54.410
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

33:54.479 --> 33:58.669
Just have Amy call me if
you hear from her. Thanks.

33:58.734 --> 34:02.531
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at
the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.028
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

34:05.102 --> 34:07.590
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.

34:15.022 --> 34:17.411
Nick, be careful.

34:17.485 --> 34:20.301
Yes, Mother.

34:20.366 --> 34:22.373
I'll go up with them.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.125
It's Quark!

34:39.406 --> 34:41.543
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?

34:41.614 --> 34:44.614
- It's that stupid cat of theirs!
- Our cat is not stupid.

34:44.686 --> 34:48.547
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Russ' stupid cat!

34:48.621 --> 34:52.299
- Hang on, Nick!
- I can't! I'm slipping!

34:53.838 --> 34:55.943
Nicky!

34:56.014 --> 34:59.309
Nicky! Get out of there!

34:59.374 --> 35:01.927
You're allergic to pollen!

35:01.998 --> 35:05.478
It's too big!

35:05.550 --> 35:07.721
I'm too little to breathe it in!

35:17.869 --> 35:19.724
Diane!

35:19.789 --> 35:21.612
Hi, Mae.

35:21.678 --> 35:24.678
- We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.597
You haven't seen Ronnie
or Russ, have you?

35:27.661 --> 35:30.695
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.

35:30.766 --> 35:33.100
If you see them, would you
send them home right away?

35:33.165 --> 35:35.718
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing
if you see mine.

35:37.453 --> 35:40.901
Russell, the Szalinski kids
are missing too.

35:40.974 --> 35:43.559
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

35:43.629 --> 35:45.734
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

35:45.805 --> 35:47.627
Ronald?

35:47.693 --> 35:49.548
Russell?

35:54.830 --> 35:56.291
Amy?

35:57.325 --> 35:59.180
Nick?

36:01.389 --> 36:03.277
Amy?

36:03.341 --> 36:05.480
- What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.809
Sounds more like a swarm of...

36:11.693 --> 36:13.581
Bees!

36:18.733 --> 36:21.580
- Amy! Get him off of me!
- Nicky!

36:21.645 --> 36:23.718
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!

36:25.293 --> 36:28.359
- Russ!
- Nicky!

36:29.421 --> 36:32.236
Nick, give me your hand!

36:32.301 --> 36:34.756
- Nick, hold on!
- Russ!

36:35.789 --> 36:39.084
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault!

36:39.148 --> 36:42.018
Shut up!
My brother's up there too.

36:42.093 --> 36:44.776
Help!

36:44.845 --> 36:46.852
Russ, don't let go!

36:49.516 --> 36:51.371
Hold on!

36:57.900 --> 36:59.624
Help!

37:09.965 --> 37:12.332
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go
to the mall and look for the kids.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.949
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back?

37:15.020 --> 37:16.875
Okay.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.915
Hey, Szalinski!

37:21.485 --> 37:24.714
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

37:24.780 --> 37:28.642
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

37:28.716 --> 37:30.625
You know, the jungles
are receding everywhere.

37:32.397 --> 37:33.804
Dad!

37:35.692 --> 37:38.856
- Don't!
- Stop! Stop, please! We're on the bee!

37:41.645 --> 37:43.433
Wh... Where is it? Come on!

37:43.500 --> 37:45.769
- Stop! Don't kill us!
- Dad, don't kill us!

37:48.268 --> 37:50.537
Stop it! Whoa!

37:55.468 --> 37:58.948
Hold on, Nick!
We're goin' down!

38:05.612 --> 38:07.019
Wayne...

38:08.524 --> 38:11.623
if the Boorsteins come by,
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

38:11.692 --> 38:14.114
You think you can handle that?

38:15.436 --> 38:18.153
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

38:22.188 --> 38:24.042
Wait a second.

38:25.516 --> 38:27.370
Nick doesn't play baseball.

38:32.012 --> 38:34.532
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.458
This is all a bad dream.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.305
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!

38:39.372 --> 38:41.575
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.

38:41.644 --> 38:44.229
I'm warning you.

38:46.860 --> 38:49.893
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.

38:50.956 --> 38:53.377
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

38:53.451 --> 38:57.445
- But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow!

38:57.516 --> 39:00.232
Get up!

39:00.300 --> 39:02.503
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

39:02.572 --> 39:05.157
Yeah, I hope your face
ends up on a milk carton.

39:15.691 --> 39:17.862
My chair.

39:20.491 --> 39:21.865
My couch.

39:27.244 --> 39:29.098
It works.

39:36.331 --> 39:39.495
Nick? Amy?

39:39.563 --> 39:41.418
Can you hear me?

39:43.211 --> 39:45.065
Nick.

40:41.163 --> 40:43.651
Mm-hmm.

40:55.051 --> 40:57.440
Nick.

40:57.514 --> 40:58.791
Nick.

41:02.922 --> 41:04.264
Nick?

41:05.770 --> 41:07.810
Are you okay?

41:10.794 --> 41:14.372
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

41:15.467 --> 41:16.710
It didn't take too long.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.504
I'm scared, Russ.

41:23.530 --> 41:25.472
We could be anywhere now.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.409
- I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?

41:29.482 --> 41:31.489
Any other yard,
the grass would be shorter.

41:31.562 --> 41:34.497
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.

41:34.569 --> 41:36.991
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.

41:37.066 --> 41:40.775
After all, she's the one who paid
for it. That makes her an accomplice.
You know what it's like in jail?

41:40.842 --> 41:43.045
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up!

41:43.113 --> 41:45.056
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?

41:45.129 --> 41:50.115
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,
you smacked me around.

41:50.185 --> 41:52.771
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

41:52.842 --> 41:55.744
- The whole Szalinski family's
gonna be in jail for life.
- Look.

41:55.818 --> 41:57.247
My dad's machine works.

41:57.322 --> 42:00.933
When we get home and he fixes us all,
we're gonna be so rich.

42:01.001 --> 42:02.856
You'll regret this.

42:04.585 --> 42:07.520
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.

42:07.594 --> 42:09.448
I mean, your dad's
a real nice guy.

42:09.514 --> 42:14.020
He's not as weird as I thought he was,
and I love you and Nick
like my own brother and sister.

42:33.289 --> 42:35.907
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

42:35.977 --> 42:37.832
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

42:52.905 --> 42:55.010
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?

42:59.081 --> 43:00.226
Run, Nick!

43:05.673 --> 43:07.429
Whoa! Oh! Ow!

43:17.321 --> 43:19.655
- Russ! Russ!
- Get up!

43:35.336 --> 43:37.573
Get in there!

43:37.641 --> 43:39.975
Get out of there!

43:49.480 --> 43:53.255
- Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?
Uh, we're the Boorsteins.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.295
Get off the grass!

43:55.369 --> 43:57.889
Get off the grass!

44:03.016 --> 44:04.609
Up there!

44:15.689 --> 44:16.671
Nicky!

44:24.104 --> 44:26.209
- Amy!
- Get under that ledge!

45:03.495 --> 45:06.430
It's very delicate, the lawn.

45:06.504 --> 45:08.359
You don't want
to overwater, really.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.167
Get her!

45:30.696 --> 45:32.070
Amy?

45:40.456 --> 45:41.830
Get away.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.188
Please don't die.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.687
Amy.

46:44.935 --> 46:48.415
No, Cathy, I just thought
they might have stopped by.

46:48.486 --> 46:51.039
Okay, listen. If you see them,
would you send them home?

46:51.111 --> 46:53.053
Okay. You have a good weekend.

46:55.559 --> 46:58.593
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

47:03.463 --> 47:04.870
Oh, no.

47:10.214 --> 47:12.581
You had to bring the dog. I don't want
to hear any more about the cat.

47:12.646 --> 47:14.751
It's the Forresters!
What are we gonna tell 'em?

47:14.822 --> 47:17.670
- How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

47:18.599 --> 47:19.876
Don!

47:21.734 --> 47:23.141
How 'bout catching some...

47:26.502 --> 47:28.924
- Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.

47:28.999 --> 47:31.420
Say good morning, Sushi.

47:31.494 --> 47:35.356
Well, the fishing report
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust
while the sun still shines, huh?

47:35.430 --> 47:38.332
- I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.
- He's says they're jumpin' in the boat.

47:38.406 --> 47:42.661
- Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.
- Donald, that man over there is flying.

47:42.726 --> 47:45.410
- Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.

47:45.479 --> 47:48.577
I don't think
we're gonna be able to make it.
Maybe you oughta go on ahead.

47:48.646 --> 47:52.159
What do you... What do you mean you don't
think you're gonna be able to make it?
We're caravanning, good buddy.

47:52.230 --> 47:54.532
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!

47:54.598 --> 47:57.216
And besides, if you're not there
by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.

47:57.286 --> 47:58.813
Confidentially...

48:00.006 --> 48:01.861
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

48:03.302 --> 48:05.375
Plumbing.

48:05.446 --> 48:06.940
"Plumbing"?

48:08.263 --> 48:10.629
Well, this isn't
the Big Russ Thompson I know.

48:10.694 --> 48:13.858
I mean, plumbing would not stop
the Big Russ Thompson I know...

48:13.926 --> 48:16.031
especially with
an $80 deposit on the line.

48:16.102 --> 48:19.265
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

48:29.446 --> 48:30.940
Don?

48:34.822 --> 48:36.731
- Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...

48:36.806 --> 48:38.497
- Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?

48:38.566 --> 48:39.776
Come on.

48:43.974 --> 48:45.218
Mm-hmm.

48:51.910 --> 48:54.561
- You tell him the truth?
- Honey!

48:54.630 --> 48:56.539
- They take it okay?
- Mae.

49:00.550 --> 49:03.845
Eighty bucks, Mae!
Nonrefundable!

49:03.909 --> 49:05.851
Those kids are grounded!

49:14.309 --> 49:16.546
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

49:17.926 --> 49:20.446
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

49:24.933 --> 49:27.137
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

49:27.973 --> 49:31.170
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.

49:33.317 --> 49:35.390
Yeah, I know, Nick.

49:36.901 --> 49:39.323
Where'd you learn
artificial respiration?

49:41.861 --> 49:44.000
- French class, kid.
- Oh.

49:45.797 --> 49:47.553
"French class"?

50:05.957 --> 50:07.964
How 'bout a truce, okay?

50:10.917 --> 50:12.062
Okay.

50:21.765 --> 50:24.764
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

50:24.837 --> 50:27.804
- You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.

50:27.876 --> 50:29.087
Let's go.

50:35.589 --> 50:37.051
French class.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.697
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

50:53.765 --> 50:56.153
with chocolate sprinkles,
and a banana split.

50:58.117 --> 51:00.418
I could eat a corn dog
the size of a truck.

51:01.572 --> 51:04.507
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

51:06.724 --> 51:10.401
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house!

51:10.468 --> 51:12.835
I saw it first.
It's mine!

51:12.900 --> 51:15.289
I got dibs on the cream filling!

51:15.364 --> 51:17.273
Nick, it's one of your cookies!

51:26.244 --> 51:28.732
They're never gonna
believe this at school.

51:28.804 --> 51:31.618
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

51:31.684 --> 51:33.058
"Dear Miss Mason:

51:33.124 --> 51:35.710
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note."

51:41.892 --> 51:44.891
- Guys, quick! Over here!
- Where?

51:44.964 --> 51:47.452
- Right there.
- Nicky, hurry!

51:50.468 --> 51:52.356
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.

51:52.420 --> 51:55.289
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.

51:56.388 --> 51:58.941
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.

51:59.012 --> 52:02.973
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.

52:03.044 --> 52:05.891
- Just one ant.
- When is the last time
you saw just one ant?

52:05.956 --> 52:08.411
- He's a scout. The rest of them
will be here any minute.
- Wait!

52:09.540 --> 52:11.906
You ever see how fast ants go?

52:11.972 --> 52:15.354
We could ride him and get back
to the house in no time.

52:15.428 --> 52:16.890
Forget it, Nick.

52:18.596 --> 52:20.636
Amy, he could take us all.

52:20.707 --> 52:23.904
- Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?

52:23.972 --> 52:26.590
That's like bench-pressing
a bulldozer!

52:26.659 --> 52:29.048
Yeah, so think of what
he could do to us.

52:29.124 --> 52:30.979
Let's go before he brings
the rest of them.

52:31.044 --> 52:33.215
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

52:34.243 --> 52:35.225
Russ?

52:36.963 --> 52:41.087
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!
- Come on, you guys!

52:41.156 --> 52:43.644
Geronimo!

52:43.716 --> 52:46.017
Get him!

52:46.083 --> 52:47.906
You guys! Nicky!

52:47.972 --> 52:51.288
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!
- Ron, be careful.

52:51.363 --> 52:53.054
Yee-ha!

52:53.124 --> 52:54.814
- Nick, get over there! Over there!
- You guys...

52:54.884 --> 52:57.153
Get behind it!

52:58.403 --> 53:00.672
- Get back here, Nicky!
- Watch out!

53:03.843 --> 53:06.177
- Look out!
- Nick, the others
could come any second!

53:09.667 --> 53:11.707
- Nicky!
- Go, Nick!

53:12.611 --> 53:15.393
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, the wrong end!

53:15.460 --> 53:19.005
- Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.
- Go over there.

53:20.675 --> 53:22.431
- Nicky, get away!
- Ron, get on!

53:23.939 --> 53:25.466
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.

53:29.059 --> 53:31.328
Ron, go for it!

53:32.771 --> 53:34.331
Hey. Hello.

53:35.491 --> 53:36.571
Ant!

53:39.331 --> 53:40.575
Here.

53:40.643 --> 53:43.458
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

53:48.131 --> 53:49.309
You guys, come on.

53:50.147 --> 53:52.700
Somebody take this cookie.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.593
Nicky, take this thing!

53:55.619 --> 53:58.488
Help! Nicky!

53:59.395 --> 54:02.493
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.

54:02.562 --> 54:04.831
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.

54:04.899 --> 54:07.168
- Somebody, help me!
- Yeah.

54:07.235 --> 54:09.144
- Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky!

54:09.219 --> 54:11.074
- For a girl.
- Of course.

54:30.147 --> 54:32.962
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.

54:33.027 --> 54:35.449
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.

54:35.522 --> 54:37.595
Quark, get away from there.

54:37.667 --> 54:39.194
Quark. Here, boy.

54:40.514 --> 54:42.140
Quark. Quark.

54:44.962 --> 54:47.101
Get away, boy. Drop it!

54:47.171 --> 54:49.080
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

54:49.154 --> 54:51.837
Whoa!

54:51.906 --> 54:57.209
Whoa!

54:58.435 --> 55:01.152
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

55:01.219 --> 55:03.390
Oh, okay, it's 646...

55:07.331 --> 55:09.916
That guy's got serious problems.

55:10.690 --> 55:13.308
<i>Mrs. Thompson? Hello?</i>

55:13.378 --> 55:16.280
646 Sycamore. Yes.

55:19.619 --> 55:23.099
Great idea, Russ, even if
the boy genius didn't think of it.

55:23.170 --> 55:25.025
Low bridge!

55:28.003 --> 55:29.977
At this rate,
we'll be home by dinner.

55:30.946 --> 55:32.920
Maybe I can still go out...

55:34.019 --> 55:35.928
with Patty.

55:36.002 --> 55:39.679
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

55:39.746 --> 55:41.982
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

55:42.050 --> 55:44.767
We are camping, Ron,
only better.

55:44.834 --> 55:47.289
- This is like a safari.
- Hey.

55:47.362 --> 55:49.336
Yeah, I never thought
of it that way, you know.

55:50.082 --> 55:51.609
Onward!

56:07.810 --> 56:09.817
Amy?

56:09.890 --> 56:11.352
Nick!

56:12.929 --> 56:14.336
Wayne?

56:22.689 --> 56:26.366
Uh, yeah, um, I would like
to report, um, two missing children.

56:26.433 --> 56:28.954
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it,
why don't you go out and...

56:29.026 --> 56:32.059
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

56:32.129 --> 56:34.268
- You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.

56:34.338 --> 56:38.331
- You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.
- Quit? I thought he was cut.

56:38.401 --> 56:40.987
- He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...

56:41.058 --> 56:44.407
What do you mean he was afraid to tell
me? He could tell me anything he wants.
You know me. I'll always listen.

56:44.481 --> 56:46.270
Mm-hmm.

56:46.337 --> 56:48.126
- What's "Uh-huh" supposed to mean?
- Russell.

56:48.193 --> 56:51.357
- No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.

56:51.426 --> 56:54.971
- You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways to...
- Whoa, my kids did not run away.

56:55.041 --> 56:59.264
They are happy kids,
and there's no way you can
make me believe that they ran away.

56:59.329 --> 57:02.046
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?

57:02.113 --> 57:03.324
Mm-hmm.

57:03.394 --> 57:07.616
- Russell!
- Why do I feel like
I'm the one on trial here?

57:07.681 --> 57:09.983
- Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?

57:10.049 --> 57:12.416
Well, I think we have
enough to get started.

57:12.481 --> 57:15.132
Please give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

57:15.201 --> 57:16.510
Fine.

57:24.481 --> 57:26.423
Don't they need a warrant or something?

57:26.497 --> 57:29.846
Russell, there's a few things
about yourself I think you should know.

57:31.073 --> 57:34.368
- Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.

57:37.345 --> 57:39.963
Oh, another missing children report.

57:40.032 --> 57:44.375
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.

57:46.081 --> 57:47.968
I've called the police.
What's on your head?

57:48.033 --> 57:50.269
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

57:50.337 --> 57:52.508
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?

57:52.577 --> 57:54.486
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

57:55.552 --> 57:58.008
That is the couch from the attic.

57:59.073 --> 58:01.756
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.
I found it on the floor.

58:01.824 --> 58:04.191
It's my thinking couch.

58:04.257 --> 58:05.500
Wayne...

58:06.657 --> 58:09.439
Are you trying to tell me...

58:09.504 --> 58:11.293
You did it?

58:11.360 --> 58:14.459
It works?
The machine works?

58:14.529 --> 58:17.431
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.

58:17.505 --> 58:19.447
- That's great.
- No, it's not that great.

58:19.521 --> 58:21.692
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

58:21.761 --> 58:23.288
- What?
- And the Thompson kids too.

58:23.360 --> 58:25.946
- They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.
- What?

58:26.016 --> 58:28.667
Threw them out with the trash.

58:28.737 --> 58:30.875
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

58:31.584 --> 58:33.242
Yes?

58:33.312 --> 58:36.444
Did, uh, you report
some missing children?

58:37.473 --> 58:40.407
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?

58:44.000 --> 58:46.618
She's w... Thank you.

58:49.953 --> 58:51.960
Mm-hmm.

59:00.864 --> 59:03.996
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?

59:10.336 --> 59:12.791
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

59:19.488 --> 59:20.732
Here. You deserve this.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.727
We're not gonna make it before dark.

59:25.760 --> 59:29.338
Yeah. Even if we did,
the mall would be closed.

59:29.408 --> 59:33.401
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.

59:36.416 --> 59:39.765
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family
might be worried about him.

59:39.839 --> 59:43.734
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

59:43.808 --> 59:45.663
Help me get off the harness.

59:54.528 --> 59:56.415
You can go now.

01:00:00.415 --> 01:00:02.652
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:07.418
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.654
You're free.
You get home now.

01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:11.930
Shoo!

01:00:15.007 --> 01:00:18.651
- Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know
what's best for him.

01:00:20.607 --> 01:00:23.923
Go on! Go home!
Mom will never let me keep you.

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:32.987
Amy? Nick?

01:00:33.055 --> 01:00:34.997
- Nick?
- Are you there, kids?

01:00:35.071 --> 01:00:37.013
Nicky.

01:00:37.087 --> 01:00:38.614
Where are you?

01:00:40.479 --> 01:00:42.846
- Any luck?
- No.

01:00:58.239 --> 01:00:59.548
Nick?

01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:01.981
Amy?

01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:10.170
- You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:12.311
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.

01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:15.835
Keep looking. Nick?

01:01:15.903 --> 01:01:17.758
Amy?

01:01:23.295 --> 01:01:25.848
- What was that?
- Ow!

01:01:25.919 --> 01:01:27.195
Watch out!

01:01:29.278 --> 01:01:30.227
Come on.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.166
- Ugh.
- Where did that come from?

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:51.478
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.

01:01:55.198 --> 01:01:58.068
Oof. Looks like
he started up again.

01:01:58.142 --> 01:02:00.793
No. He only smokes when he's
really worried about something.

01:02:04.446 --> 01:02:06.301
Nicky, be careful.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.428
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:28.245
Cool. Now we can
see in the dark.

01:02:34.174 --> 01:02:36.378
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.

01:02:37.886 --> 01:02:39.795
- I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.

01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:42.455
But you always make
a big deal out of sports.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:46.301
- Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.

01:02:46.366 --> 01:02:49.148
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...

01:02:49.214 --> 01:02:52.443
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.419
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:07.964
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.266
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:13.333
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?

01:03:13.405 --> 01:03:16.089
Well, the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound...

01:03:16.158 --> 01:03:18.841
- and then through laser inversion,
it takes all the...
- Wait, Wayne, wait.

01:03:18.909 --> 01:03:21.048
I think the Thompsons
need to see the couch.

01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:25.524
This guy is a waste of skin.

01:03:27.038 --> 01:03:29.907
- This is a microscope.
- I know.

01:03:30.845 --> 01:03:31.925
Look in there.

01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:34.458
All right.

01:03:35.614 --> 01:03:39.126
You see, that's the couch that
used to be sitting right over here,
until the machine shrunk it.

01:03:39.197 --> 01:03:41.434
All right, so there's
some doll furniture. Big deal.

01:03:41.501 --> 01:03:44.218
They sell that kind of stuff
at swap meets.

01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:46.140
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:49.205
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

01:03:49.277 --> 01:03:51.186
- Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.538
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.

01:03:52.606 --> 01:03:56.468
- If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be piece of them everywhere.
- Wayne!

01:03:57.502 --> 01:04:01.211
Sorry, l... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?

01:04:01.277 --> 01:04:04.147
- The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one
who needs a shrink, Szalinski.

01:04:04.221 --> 01:04:07.450
- Russ.
- You are a nutcase,
and I'll tell you something.

01:04:07.517 --> 01:04:09.972
I have got an air hammer
in my attic...

01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:13.427
and if you did do something to my kids,
there's gonna be pieces of you
all over the neighborhood!

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.875
Come on, honey.

01:04:22.173 --> 01:04:24.027
I think that went well.

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.613
I think we should
have them over more often.

01:04:26.685 --> 01:04:29.019
Yeah, well,
it's a priority for me.

01:04:29.085 --> 01:04:30.995
Now, why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:34.102
Find my kids.

01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:47.995
I thought you didn't believe him.

01:04:49.148 --> 01:04:50.359
Oh, I don't.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.499
Electricity's cheap.

01:05:16.925 --> 01:05:19.608
Come on. Look at this.

01:05:19.676 --> 01:05:21.531
We don't have to sleep
on the ground.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.028
- What is it?
- One of my Legos.

01:05:27.964 --> 01:05:29.371
Give me a boost.

01:05:33.405 --> 01:05:34.615
Hey.

01:05:36.188 --> 01:05:37.529
Not bad.

01:05:39.676 --> 01:05:42.872
Yeah. I don't even
have to brush my teeth.

01:05:43.804 --> 01:05:47.579
- Quit pushing!
- Move over.
- You move over.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.809
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

01:05:51.612 --> 01:05:53.816
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.554
Night, Antie.

01:06:05.756 --> 01:06:09.072
- Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.639
You think you'll be warm enough?

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:31.829
Good night, Russ.

01:06:33.404 --> 01:06:34.778
Good night, Amy.

01:06:40.315 --> 01:06:41.777
Good night, Amy.

01:06:44.284 --> 01:06:46.139
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

01:06:46.204 --> 01:06:48.211
<i>Meow!</i>

01:07:02.907 --> 01:07:04.314
Are you okay?

01:07:05.627 --> 01:07:06.837
I'm scared.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.507
Somehow I feel
like this is all our fault.

01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:14.426
No, it's my fault.

01:07:15.707 --> 01:07:18.871
I start working on something, and l...
I don't think about anything else.

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:23.473
I should have been more careful
with that thing. I'm sorry.

01:07:25.787 --> 01:07:27.642
That's not what I meant.

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:31.768
You know, it's not important...

01:07:31.835 --> 01:07:34.356
if I sell another house...

01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:36.631
or if you get a grant
this year or next.

01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:41.142
We've just got to get
this family back together.

01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:46.582
I feel the same way.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.674
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

01:07:58.747 --> 01:08:01.562
We've got to get up early
and come out here and look for them.

01:08:02.523 --> 01:08:03.929
No, I couldn't sleep.

01:08:05.435 --> 01:08:07.410
Not with my babies
out here all alone.

01:08:08.443 --> 01:08:11.312
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.794
They'll be fine.

01:08:14.267 --> 01:08:16.176
That's another thing
I'm worried about.

01:08:17.018 --> 01:08:19.571
Amy in the dark...

01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:21.551
with Little Russ Thompson.

01:08:21.626 --> 01:08:22.968
Get some rest.

01:08:28.986 --> 01:08:31.319
They'd better behave themselves.

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:37.558
It's funny.

01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:40.309
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:43.247
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

01:08:45.113 --> 01:08:46.969
Why? Does he pick on you
about your size?

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:50.425
The bigger the guy,
the bigger the moon.

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:54.134
It's just the way he thinks.

01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:55.761
Russ?

01:08:56.923 --> 01:08:58.930
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.778
Well...

01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:07.861
I mean...

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:10.002
you talked to me
once or twice last year.

01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:14.319
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...

01:09:16.379 --> 01:09:18.451
I just always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

01:09:20.058 --> 01:09:22.066
I was too popular to notice.

01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:25.044
I was stupid.

01:09:45.818 --> 01:09:48.687
- Get down! Hurry!
- Get down! Hurry!

01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:50.801
Ron, get down!

01:09:50.874 --> 01:09:52.149
Run!

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:58.938
Russ! Help!

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.409
- Russ, help!
- Help him!

01:10:03.481 --> 01:10:04.725
Russ!

01:10:06.042 --> 01:10:07.319
Stay here.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:19.092
No!

01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:23.576
Ron, get out! Quick!
Get away!

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.829
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on!

01:10:41.497 --> 01:10:43.537
He-He'll get killed.

01:10:43.609 --> 01:10:46.031
- We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.
- Sit down.

01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:56.208
We gotta help him.

01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:09.975
Now!

01:11:10.681 --> 01:11:13.168
- Get him!
- Get him!

01:11:22.137 --> 01:11:24.112
- Let him go!
- Look out!

01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:30.991
Back!

01:11:48.281 --> 01:11:49.590
Where's Antie?

01:11:54.713 --> 01:11:57.047
- Antie!
- There!

01:12:02.104 --> 01:12:04.111
Oh, my God.

01:12:04.184 --> 01:12:06.039
- He looks hurt.
- No!

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.066
You saved my life.

01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:13.070
No, he's gonna be okay.

01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:34.161
Where you going?

01:13:34.232 --> 01:13:35.606
Nature calls.

01:13:43.096 --> 01:13:45.038
Boys on the right,
girls on the left.

01:13:46.551 --> 01:13:48.406
I must look absolutely gross.

01:14:12.471 --> 01:14:14.326
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

01:14:58.839 --> 01:15:01.043
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.

01:15:01.111 --> 01:15:03.413
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

01:15:10.743 --> 01:15:12.750
Something's very weird here.

01:15:19.543 --> 01:15:22.445
- What is it?
- Earthquake!

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:26.064
No, worse! Lawn mower!

01:15:52.374 --> 01:15:54.284
Nicky!

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:25.291
- What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope
whatever lived here has moved out.

01:16:25.366 --> 01:16:28.083
<i>This is the burrow of
a Lumbricus terrestris.</i>

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:31.892
- A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant
this time of year.

01:16:33.974 --> 01:16:35.348
Plug that in.

01:16:36.661 --> 01:16:38.963
We're almost done here.

01:16:40.886 --> 01:16:42.828
Is that a chain saw?

01:16:42.902 --> 01:16:45.422
No, it's more like
our lawn mower, I think.

01:16:53.974 --> 01:16:56.756
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!

01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:00.468
Tommy, stop!

01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:04.524
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

01:17:04.598 --> 01:17:06.965
- Tommy! Don't go on the grass!
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here!

01:17:07.029 --> 01:17:09.004
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
- All right, together!

01:17:09.078 --> 01:17:10.539
One, two, three.

01:17:10.614 --> 01:17:13.843
Tommy! Tommy!

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.221
I think we'll be safe in here.

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:25.650
Nicky!

01:17:25.718 --> 01:17:27.311
Come on! Come on!

01:17:30.997 --> 01:17:33.452
No! No!

01:17:35.637 --> 01:17:37.841
Hold on to me, Russ!

01:17:39.477 --> 01:17:41.364
Amy, don't let go!

01:17:43.509 --> 01:17:45.069
Amy!

01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:49.742
- Hold on!
- Give me that thing!

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.516
- Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?

01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:04.273
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:06.413
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

01:18:06.485 --> 01:18:09.714
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.
Go on through the house. It's safer.

01:18:12.853 --> 01:18:14.130
"Safer"?

01:18:18.357 --> 01:18:20.332
I thought my folks are weird.

01:18:26.773 --> 01:18:28.016
My knee.

01:18:29.109 --> 01:18:30.767
Is everyone okay?

01:18:30.837 --> 01:18:32.877
I feel like a banana whip.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.675
Nick? Nick, are you all right?

01:18:45.204 --> 01:18:46.448
Nicky!

01:18:51.957 --> 01:18:53.484
Dad?

01:18:55.412 --> 01:18:56.590
Mom!

01:18:56.661 --> 01:18:58.417
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!

01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:00.787
- Dad! We're down here!
- Over here!

01:19:00.853 --> 01:19:03.187
- Mr. Szalinski!
- Down here!

01:19:03.252 --> 01:19:05.423
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

01:19:19.732 --> 01:19:21.107
We'll make it, Nick.

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.798
They're never gonna find us.

01:19:22.868 --> 01:19:25.356
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us!

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.500
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?

01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:30.606
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked!

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:35.276
Quark!

01:19:35.348 --> 01:19:37.901
Come on, everybody!
Grab on!

01:19:37.972 --> 01:19:41.267
Go inside, Quark!
Find Dad!

01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:03.116
Nicky!

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.034
Quark, what's gotten into you?

01:20:08.756 --> 01:20:11.473
- Dad!
- I think he just misses the kids.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.547
Dad! Stop!

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.521
No!

01:20:19.924 --> 01:20:21.964
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, at their size...

01:20:22.036 --> 01:20:24.370
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!
- That backyard is like ten miles.

01:20:24.435 --> 01:20:26.345
Giant blades of grass.

01:20:26.419 --> 01:20:28.045
Huge insects.

01:20:28.116 --> 01:20:31.465
- It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head
right for the house.

01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:34.290
- It's us!
- Dad!

01:20:34.355 --> 01:20:36.559
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:20:36.627 --> 01:20:38.122
No!

01:20:41.812 --> 01:20:43.437
- We're down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!

01:20:44.436 --> 01:20:46.443
No, Dad!

01:20:49.588 --> 01:20:53.363
- Dad!
- No!
- Dad!

01:20:53.428 --> 01:20:56.046
- We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help!

01:20:56.115 --> 01:20:57.576
Don't eat me!

01:21:02.195 --> 01:21:03.722
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

01:21:05.075 --> 01:21:07.825
No, Dad! Dad!

01:21:07.891 --> 01:21:09.963
- It's Nick!
- Oh, Nicky!

01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:12.239
- Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:17.035
- Look! It's the rest of them!
- Yeah!

01:21:17.107 --> 01:21:18.962
- Yeah!
- We're saved!

01:21:19.027 --> 01:21:22.027
- I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:26.226
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

01:21:28.019 --> 01:21:31.663
- Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.

01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:33.870
- So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...
- I know.

01:21:33.939 --> 01:21:36.809
- These kids aren't you.
- Baseball!

01:21:36.883 --> 01:21:39.250
- Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball!

01:21:39.315 --> 01:21:41.802
- I can't make it out.
- Let me see.

01:21:43.506 --> 01:21:45.743
The baseball, Dad!

01:21:45.811 --> 01:21:47.600
What are you saying, Nick?

01:21:51.763 --> 01:21:53.192
Swinging?

01:21:53.267 --> 01:21:55.852
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

01:21:55.923 --> 01:21:58.290
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping!

01:21:58.355 --> 01:22:00.526
- Pitching.
- Um...
- Throwing.

01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:03.594
- You're out! You're out!
- Baseball!

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:06.830
- Dad!
- Right!
- The baseball!
- The ball!

01:22:06.898 --> 01:22:09.516
- Baseball?
- Good, honey!

01:22:12.147 --> 01:22:14.569
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.

01:22:16.754 --> 01:22:18.958
I got it. The ball
came through the window...

01:22:19.026 --> 01:22:23.281
and activated the machine,
and they got in the path of the laser.

01:22:23.347 --> 01:22:26.642
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.

01:22:26.706 --> 01:22:29.357
- Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.
That's why everything was blowing up.

01:22:29.427 --> 01:22:31.794
- Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.

01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:34.313
- Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.
- Hold it, Szalinski.

01:22:34.386 --> 01:22:38.314
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids
until you try it on something living!

01:22:42.226 --> 01:22:44.048
You know something,
maybe I should do it on myself.

01:22:44.114 --> 01:22:45.969
- I'll show you how to work
the machine. It's not that hard.
- I don't know.

01:22:46.034 --> 01:22:49.679
- I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no! Do it on me.

01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:50.956
Are you sure, honey?

01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:58.156
How'd those get there?

01:23:12.498 --> 01:23:14.919
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.

01:23:16.114 --> 01:23:18.024
- No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?

01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:35.465
- Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.

01:23:35.538 --> 01:23:37.839
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

01:23:50.833 --> 01:23:53.735
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:13.545
So, if this works,
you wanna go to the dance on Friday?

01:24:15.378 --> 01:24:16.752
Can you dance?

01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:21.421
- Not really.
- I'd love to.

01:24:41.073 --> 01:24:43.920
- Oh!
- Russ! Ron!
- Dad!

01:24:43.985 --> 01:24:46.286
Oh, I knew my boys
wouldn't run away.

01:24:47.409 --> 01:24:49.165
Are you and Dad okay?

01:24:49.233 --> 01:24:51.950
<i>- Yeah, honey.
...all the way
across the yard, for miles.
- We're great.</i>

01:24:52.017 --> 01:24:53.871
- Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

01:24:53.937 --> 01:24:56.271
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.

01:24:56.337 --> 01:24:59.272
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.
She's all right.

01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:01.679
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

01:25:01.745 --> 01:25:04.560
You were right.
You were brilliant.

01:25:04.625 --> 01:25:09.098
- I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.
- I know, Ronnie, I know.

01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:11.820
Dad, if you really want me
back on the team...

01:25:11.889 --> 01:25:14.125
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.

01:25:15.056 --> 01:25:17.707
- Proud of you.
- I got better.

01:25:17.777 --> 01:25:20.592
- I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.

01:25:30.129 --> 01:25:31.557
- Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.

01:25:31.632 --> 01:25:33.520
- Good idea.
- Oh, great.
- Oh, I love toasts.

01:25:33.585 --> 01:25:36.487
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis
and many more dinners together.

01:25:36.561 --> 01:25:40.106
- Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be
having leftovers for a while.

01:25:40.176 --> 01:25:41.703
- I wonder what's
for dinner, right, Russ?
- Who wants bread?

01:25:41.777 --> 01:25:44.046
- Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta
carve this thing, huh?

01:25:44.112 --> 01:25:46.381
- Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
- Do we have butter?

01:25:46.448 --> 01:25:49.263
- Who wants bread?
- Save some room for cake.

01:25:49.328 --> 01:25:51.881
- Oh, we got cake for dessert?
- Yeah.
- Who wants bread?

01:25:58.224 --> 01:26:00.112
Hey, wait!

01:26:00.176 --> 01:26:01.932
I get it!

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.902
French class! Ha-ha!
