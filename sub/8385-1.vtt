in your yard?

It's not a river, dope.

536
00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:50.571
It could be a stream of dog pee
and it looks like a river to us.

537
00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:53.949
Let's swim it.

- I'm not swimming in that.

we could make a log bridge!

Yeah, he can. Dogs have great ears.

545
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.065
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.
