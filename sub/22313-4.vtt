00:06.832 --> 00:08.832
<i>Last time on "Superstition"...</i>

00:08.833 --> 00:10.289
The Dredge has marked
your family for death.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.131
Would it have killed you to
let me know I had a daughter?

00:12.156 --> 00:13.866
He is your father
whether you like it or not.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.632
I'm sorry I missed so much of your life.

00:15.633 --> 00:16.732
I'm not.

00:16.733 --> 00:18.866
No more secrets.

00:18.867 --> 00:21.401
I need the military records
for one Calvin Hastings.

00:21.426 --> 00:22.866
Now I need to protect my family.

00:22.867 --> 00:23.999
I want you to take this.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.533
The Ring of Solomon.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.466
Whoa.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.399
Darth Hater.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.832
Bea, we've waited
the ten requisite days.

00:34.833 --> 00:36.832
No next of kin have claimed him and...

00:36.833 --> 00:39.166
I need the space, so I'm just
gonna put him in the crematorium.

00:39.167 --> 00:41.424
- Agreed.
- We're having a proper service.

00:41.449 --> 00:43.011
No matter what
a person does in his life,

00:43.036 --> 00:44.122
the Hastings always care for the dead.

00:44.147 --> 00:45.432
What? Are you kidding me?

00:45.433 --> 00:46.866
- This is insane.
- He doesn't deserve a proper burial.

00:46.867 --> 00:48.499
Okay, since did we become
the arbiters of karma?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.699
That is not our position.
Karma takes care of itself.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.866
I'm sorry, but the $500 that county
gives us to dispose the body

00:53.891 --> 00:55.108
is worth more than him.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.112
Malcom X said,

00:56.137 --> 00:57.819
"Whatever we're passionate about,
we need to take action on."

00:57.820 --> 00:59.604
I say ashes to the toilet with this one.

00:59.629 --> 01:01.299
Okay, you are not Malcom X, and...

01:02.201 --> 01:04.632
This man was Erskine Haler.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.566
Card carrying racist.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.199
No argument there.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.378
But he was also his mother's son.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.799
His passing merits respect

01:11.800 --> 01:13.966
even if his choices don't.

01:13.967 --> 01:15.199
And that's as good as a eulogy

01:15.200 --> 01:16.732
this racist douchebag deserves.

01:16.733 --> 01:19.321
Prepare Mr. Haler for service tomorrow.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.575
His family can pay their
final respects, or not.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.966
We take care of the dead.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.567
Always have, always will.
End of discussion.

01:28.367 --> 01:30.500
You're still a racist douchebag.

01:35.167 --> 01:37.267
Get used to that heat, buddy.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.699
Okay, I think it's safe
to say no one is coming.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.932
Mm-hmm.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.999
Girl, it's been hours
and no one is here.

01:47.254 --> 01:48.729
This is a funeral fail.

01:48.754 --> 01:51.445
You know, we... We gave this
racist his time and dignity, but...

01:51.470 --> 01:53.910
this research that I need to get done...

01:54.267 --> 01:55.599
Hi.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.567
Can I help you?

01:56.568 --> 01:58.832
Are... Are you here
for Mr. Haler's service?

01:58.833 --> 02:01.666
Uh, yes, ma'am. I'm his son, Davis.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.899
Ah, Davis.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.266
Our sympathies for your loss.

02:05.267 --> 02:07.199
Please come in and pay your respects,

02:07.200 --> 02:08.632
and if there's anything
at all that you need,

02:08.633 --> 02:10.000
don't hesitate to ask.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.061
Hmm.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.499
You were right, Bea.

02:48.799 --> 02:51.232
Karma seems to take care of itself.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.300
The devil approaches on
swift wings of hell fire.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.299
Even the noblest of spirits...

03:13.300 --> 03:15.100
...cannot deny his coming judgment.

03:16.342 --> 03:17.909
NYPD!

03:17.967 --> 03:19.067
NYPD!

03:19.092 --> 03:21.351
- Hands on your head. Stay on the ground.
- Freeze!

03:21.376 --> 03:22.475
We got another one in the corner.

03:22.476 --> 03:25.008
- Come here. Come here.
- Clear! Clear me up there!

03:25.033 --> 03:26.649
Have been looking for you, man.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.998
- This is mine.
- It's not yours.

03:28.023 --> 03:29.366
- It's never yours.
- No!

03:29.367 --> 03:31.732
All right, it's time you
come up and join me, good sir.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.932
- Come on.
- Ah, shit.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.366
Come on.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.832
- You got them locked up back there, huh?
- Yeah.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.032
- Clear.
- Clear.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.232
Get him out of here.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.199
You keep that locked up.
Patla, come grab him.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.299
You ain't got nothing?

03:43.300 --> 03:44.666
- I don't know.
- Swear!

03:44.667 --> 03:45.766
Come here.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.200
You are under arrest.

03:50.067 --> 03:54.412
Anything you say, can and
will be used against you

03:54.500 --> 03:55.567
in a court of law.

03:59.833 --> 04:00.900
Don't move.

04:02.235 --> 04:03.400
Take him.

04:06.267 --> 04:08.199
It's never yours, Jose.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.567
It's never yours.

04:10.533 --> 04:11.600
You okay?

04:12.267 --> 04:13.332
Huh?

04:13.333 --> 04:15.166
Death makes everybody feel
like they're superman.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.499
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.367
The devil's...

04:21.567 --> 04:23.999
The devil was there.
I have to get it out.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.900
- The devil was there!
- Officer down!

04:37.200 --> 04:39.800
Chief? Chief... Officer down!

04:40.600 --> 04:42.799
Officer down! We need a medic.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.999
Call a paramedic.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.999
Chief? Chief? Come on.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.933
Call a paramedic. You, call a bus!

04:48.019 --> 04:49.541
Chief?

04:54.567 --> 04:56.399
We have an officer down.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.933
I'm right here.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.141
Patla! Patla! Over here!

05:01.166 --> 05:02.699
Tell them to hurry.
I'm not getting a pulse.

05:02.762 --> 05:03.861
Patla!

05:04.006 --> 05:05.472
Chief.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.649
Come on.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.400
Where's my medic?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.066
Patla.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.786
I still don't have a pulse.

05:20.865 --> 05:22.042
Come on.

05:22.207 --> 05:24.207
1, 2, 3...

05:26.900 --> 05:29.132
- Where's my medic?
- Patla, over here!

05:29.133 --> 05:31.032
I'm not dead.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.866
Let me out of this damn...

05:32.867 --> 05:35.167
Patla, please.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.166
Oh, hang on there, warrior. I got you.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.432
I got it, thanks.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.299
I forgot to order
the flowers for next week.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.667
I did that yesterday.

05:51.794 --> 05:56.784
And... I have the programs
for the next three services

05:56.856 --> 05:58.856
all folded and ready to go.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.017
Gonna make me look bad in front of Mom?

06:01.057 --> 06:02.922
What? No. I just figured

06:02.947 --> 06:04.313
there's a lot of things
that need to be done, and...

06:04.314 --> 06:05.380
Hey, I'm kidding.

06:05.381 --> 06:06.680
- Okay.
- Okay, as long everything's

06:06.681 --> 06:07.846
still running smoothly downstairs?

06:07.847 --> 06:09.557
Oh, absolutely. Mr. Lou's
all set and ready

06:09.582 --> 06:12.013
for tomorrow's service. Arm
re-attached and everything.

06:12.014 --> 06:13.313
You can re-attach an arm?

06:13.314 --> 06:15.080
Ah, well, enough to get
through the sleeve

06:15.081 --> 06:16.380
of pin stripe suit. Yes.

06:16.381 --> 06:18.746
You don't have to
help us in front of the house.

06:18.747 --> 06:20.380
Calvin and I have
everything under control.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.380
Well, you know, I figured
with Isaac gone

06:22.381 --> 06:24.646
and our other activities are vamping up,

06:24.647 --> 06:26.646
they, you know...
It's all hands on deck.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.413
Uh, oh. I forgot. I got the lynch

06:28.414 --> 06:30.014
from the laundromat.
Let me go get those.

06:31.781 --> 06:33.480
She's gonna burn herself out.

06:33.481 --> 06:35.380
Yeah, I can smell the crash already.

06:35.381 --> 06:37.371
Mm.

06:37.471 --> 06:39.514
I'm okay.

06:41.014 --> 06:42.247
Yeah.

06:46.047 --> 06:47.047
Where is she?

06:49.047 --> 06:50.746
Blunt force trauma to the head

06:50.747 --> 06:51.880
and we're waiting on tests results

06:51.881 --> 06:53.730
before we further
assess her status, but...

06:54.947 --> 06:56.846
At the moment she's
showing no brain activity.

06:56.847 --> 06:59.080
And her heart was stopped for how long?

06:59.081 --> 07:00.547
Almost 11 minutes.

07:02.747 --> 07:03.880
Bea, you should sit down.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.113
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll be fine.

07:06.114 --> 07:08.380
Fine, Eddie.

07:08.381 --> 07:10.181
Are you expecting her to wake up?

07:11.114 --> 07:12.814
Well, there's always hope.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.695
But you need to prepare for the worst.

07:16.847 --> 07:18.947
- Do you want me to call Garvey?
- No.

07:19.381 --> 07:20.746
I'll tell her.

07:20.747 --> 07:22.947
Thank you, thank you, Doctor

07:30.347 --> 07:31.380
Calvin?

07:31.381 --> 07:33.281
Can't lose you now.

07:35.614 --> 07:37.514
Are you here, Calvin?

07:49.114 --> 07:51.081
Here.

07:55.707 --> 07:57.350
I'm here. I'm here.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.513
Come on.

08:02.514 --> 08:03.855
You're looking right at me.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.313
Come on.

08:13.181 --> 08:14.280
Come on.

08:14.281 --> 08:15.413
Come on.

08:15.414 --> 08:16.546
Calvin, I know...

08:16.547 --> 08:19.081
I know you...

08:27.132 --> 08:28.847
What the hell?

08:29.949 --> 08:31.246
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:32.481 --> 08:34.313
No!

08:34.313 --> 08:36.046
No, don't, don't.

08:36.047 --> 08:38.179
Please. Get off of me.

08:38.181 --> 08:39.480
Get off!

08:46.147 --> 08:47.313
Stop.

08:47.314 --> 08:49.213
Get back! Move!

08:49.214 --> 08:50.646
Move. Move. Move.

08:50.647 --> 08:52.147
Move, move.

08:52.581 --> 08:53.780
Move. Get back.

08:53.781 --> 08:54.946
Move. Move!

08:54.947 --> 08:56.313
Move. Let's go.

08:56.314 --> 08:57.446
Move. Get back!

08:57.447 --> 08:59.147
Get back. Get back.

09:01.655 --> 09:03.155
Let's go.

09:05.181 --> 09:06.826
No, no, no, no.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.213
I'm sorry. I'm superstitious.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.180
Uh, I'll walk around the edge though.

09:10.181 --> 09:12.380
Okay. Come on, this way.

09:12.381 --> 09:13.980
What the hell were those things?

09:13.981 --> 09:16.081
Still looked like they were
wearing name tags.

09:18.447 --> 09:20.780
Barely see them outside during the day.

09:20.781 --> 09:21.880
Where are you taking me?

09:21.881 --> 09:23.614
Away from those things.

09:24.581 --> 09:25.713
But who are you?

09:25.714 --> 09:28.314
I'm Sarah. The one who just saved you.

09:29.447 --> 09:30.613
Uh-huh.

09:30.614 --> 09:31.681
How'd you get here?

09:33.014 --> 09:34.880
A few days ago I died.

09:34.881 --> 09:38.514
In front of that mirror in the old
plantation house on Magnolia.

09:39.547 --> 09:40.714
How?

09:42.214 --> 09:43.247
Overdose.

09:44.457 --> 09:46.964
I was trying to stay clean
but my ex came in town

09:47.047 --> 09:48.837
with few of his friends and, uh,

09:49.014 --> 09:50.647
just made some bad choices.

09:51.514 --> 09:52.914
Listen, I'm sorry.

09:54.914 --> 09:56.181
Do I get your name?

09:57.681 --> 09:59.214
May.

10:00.147 --> 10:01.714
It's nice to meet you, May.

10:03.614 --> 10:05.346
Look, we can help each other
get out of here

10:05.347 --> 10:08.047
or we can go our separate
ways. It's your call.

10:09.647 --> 10:12.014
You know, there's...
There's strength in numbers.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.214
So what is this place, anyway?

10:17.581 --> 10:18.614
Who knows.

10:19.547 --> 10:22.214
Purgatory, backwards hell.

10:22.881 --> 10:24.146
I guess that superstition

10:24.147 --> 10:25.780
about spirits getting
sucked into mirrors

10:25.781 --> 10:28.501
- after they die is true.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not dead.

10:28.847 --> 10:30.177
What?

10:30.264 --> 10:31.413
I'm not dead.

10:31.414 --> 10:33.645
- How is that possible?
- My body's still on life support.

10:33.670 --> 10:34.880
That's why I was at the hospital

10:34.881 --> 10:36.246
to see what was going on
on the other side.

10:36.247 --> 10:38.280
That's great.
That means there is a chance

10:38.281 --> 10:39.646
that you could still cross back over.

10:39.647 --> 10:40.713
Wait. How?

10:40.714 --> 10:42.380
I... I don't know.
But there has to be a way.

10:42.381 --> 10:43.946
If you're alive, that's a loophole.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.246
Yeah.

10:45.247 --> 10:46.846
We need to get back to the mirror.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.017
No, no, no, no.
Wait, I need to find my...

10:48.042 --> 10:49.985
Why? No one's on the other
side who can hear or see you.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.449
I will make them hear or see me.

10:51.509 --> 10:52.579
You're wasting your time.

10:52.604 --> 10:54.247
I promise you I wasted an entire day

10:54.295 --> 10:55.575
screaming at people
through the other side.

10:55.576 --> 10:58.308
Sarah. Sarah. My family is
just a little bit different.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.476
If I can get through to them,
they can help us both.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.508
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay?

11:02.509 --> 11:04.742
I'll wait here in case any of
those dark things show up.

11:04.743 --> 11:06.276
- Great.
- Okay.

11:09.009 --> 11:11.108
Yeah, but why would he say that?

11:11.109 --> 11:13.042
Your mom's listed as an organ donor.

11:13.043 --> 11:16.176
Dr. Kim knows that she
could save a lot of lives.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.085
Yeah, but she's still alive.

11:34.150 --> 11:36.616
You better get that sick ass
vulture away from me.

11:36.641 --> 11:38.608
You know, Dr. Kim is a fine doctor.

11:38.609 --> 11:42.324
But he said that your mom's not
showing any brain activity.

11:42.379 --> 11:45.036
Oh, please. Please, don't say that.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.442
You're not really thinking
about pulling the plug.

11:55.443 --> 11:57.542
I'm just letting you know
what the doctor said.

11:57.543 --> 12:01.004
- The mirror.
- Decisions will be based on that.

12:04.509 --> 12:06.449
I see you, baby.

12:06.612 --> 12:08.344
So we don't listen to him.

12:08.409 --> 12:11.209
He probably gets a bonus
for every other organ.

12:12.577 --> 12:14.643
There has to be something
in the alchemy room.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.853
What about the Shroud of Turin?

12:17.976 --> 12:19.908
- It doesn't give life.
- Okay.

12:19.909 --> 12:23.142
It just aids in regeneration.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.842
Okay, so we find something else.
But we find something.

12:25.843 --> 12:27.675
It's gonna be a tough one, kiddo.

12:27.676 --> 12:30.308
Your mom wasn't injured
by anything supernatural.

12:30.309 --> 12:32.675
So we focus on something else.

12:34.943 --> 12:37.309
You can't hear me. You can't see me.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.619
Okay.

12:45.676 --> 12:46.743
Damn it!

12:46.997 --> 12:48.329
Baby.

12:48.576 --> 12:49.875
I'm so sorry.

12:49.876 --> 12:51.742
No, you're not.

12:51.743 --> 12:55.608
You're giving up on her, just
like you did before I was born.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.676
Okay. Hey. No.

12:56.731 --> 12:57.701
Look.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.176
No one is giving up on your mother.

13:01.805 --> 13:04.154
No one's giving up on her. Okay?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.175
She is like a daughter to me.

13:08.176 --> 13:11.476
When your grandparents died,
they gave me power of attorney.

13:12.231 --> 13:13.980
And Lord knows...

13:14.409 --> 13:17.566
I can't begin to imagine
a life without her, but...

13:17.676 --> 13:20.614
When the time comes, we
have to respect her wishes.

13:21.326 --> 13:22.858
I know she wouldn't want this.

13:22.883 --> 13:26.209
- Oh.
- There has to be something we can do.

13:28.243 --> 13:30.543
All we can do is say goodbye.

13:34.973 --> 13:36.884
I'm here...

13:39.343 --> 13:40.509
I'm sorry.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.053
I wish it was you and not my mom.

13:46.676 --> 13:49.008
Garvey, I'm sorry.

13:49.009 --> 13:50.704
I'm here.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.043
I'll take her to the hospital.

14:08.709 --> 14:09.809
Hey...

14:11.009 --> 14:12.509
She didn't mean that.

14:16.209 --> 14:17.509
What if she's right?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.109
What if we are giving up too soon?

14:23.209 --> 14:25.543
Dr. Kim's prognosis was sound.

14:31.143 --> 14:34.386
If you ever need to talk about anything,

14:34.476 --> 14:37.142
- or, you know, just...
- I'm fine.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.675
I'm just... I'm gonna go take a shower.

14:39.676 --> 14:40.809
I need to think.

15:16.843 --> 15:17.909
May.

15:20.609 --> 15:21.842
May!

15:23.076 --> 15:25.851
Somebody. Get me out of here, please.

15:40.947 --> 15:42.812
...away.

15:45.909 --> 15:48.608
"Tried to kill me. I ran away"

15:49.809 --> 15:51.208
What could those things be?

15:51.209 --> 15:53.108
How can you see her?

15:53.109 --> 15:54.842
Must be Pop's ring.

15:54.843 --> 15:58.408
So... So, May got sucked into the mirror
which was attacked at the flophouse,

15:58.409 --> 16:02.642
which means the mirror's
either enchanted or cursed.

16:02.643 --> 16:03.643
I'll be right back.

16:03.644 --> 16:05.680
The main thing is,
how do we get her out now?

16:05.705 --> 16:08.975
I found it. It's a little something
Isaac picked up in Macedonia.

16:08.976 --> 16:12.843
It should be able to open up a
channel, so we can hear her.

16:13.676 --> 16:14.743
May?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.576
May, say something.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.343
Come on.

16:19.976 --> 16:21.508
Can you hear me?

16:21.509 --> 16:23.008
Yes!

16:23.009 --> 16:24.808
Yes, we can hear you.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.742
Oh... Okay, thank God.

16:26.743 --> 16:29.308
Thank God. I thought I was gonna
be trapped in here forever.

16:29.309 --> 16:30.694
Oh, my God, Mom, are you okay?

16:30.719 --> 16:32.717
Yes. Yes, my Garvey. I'm great.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.675
Now that you all know that I'm
alive, I'm... I'm... Yeah.

16:35.676 --> 16:37.308
Yeah.

16:37.309 --> 16:39.443
Yeah, Calvin was gonna pull the plug.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.142
Right.

16:42.143 --> 16:44.542
Right, baby, I signed a DNR.

16:44.845 --> 16:46.844
He was only trying to respect my wishes.

16:46.869 --> 16:48.975
That's not an easy thing to do.

16:48.976 --> 16:50.243
Thank you.

16:51.442 --> 16:54.376
Now, I wish to get
the hell out of this mirror.

16:54.401 --> 16:55.642
Please tell me you have
some kind of, uh...

16:55.643 --> 16:57.734
A book or a scroll or something

16:57.759 --> 16:59.051
that already has the answer in it.

16:59.076 --> 17:01.908
May... May, are those strange
beings still following you?

17:01.909 --> 17:03.176
Um...

17:04.443 --> 17:05.376
No.

17:05.377 --> 17:07.314
No, I haven't seen
any of them around here.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.012
Um, maybe... Maybe
the wards around the house,

17:10.038 --> 17:12.592
they might work over here too or...
I don't... I don't know.

17:12.617 --> 17:13.941
May. May, can you hear me?

17:13.965 --> 17:15.075
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.008
Um, how did you get trapped in there?
Was there an inferno,

17:18.009 --> 17:20.308
- or a spell, or something...
- No. No.

17:20.309 --> 17:21.742
I... I got hit.

17:21.742 --> 17:26.275
I woke up and I was over
here in this mirror thing.

17:26.276 --> 17:28.041
There's an old superstition.

17:28.067 --> 17:31.253
When someone dies near a mirror
their soul can get trapped inside.

17:31.277 --> 17:32.212
Yes.

17:32.213 --> 17:33.476
This is why we cover all the mirrors

17:33.501 --> 17:34.941
at the house when there's a funeral.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.495
Calvin, we need that mirror.

17:37.576 --> 17:39.542
It's a center of whatever
magic trapped her.

17:39.543 --> 17:40.976
I'll meet you at the flophouse.

17:41.476 --> 17:44.642
No, May, no.
Uh, wait till I get back. It's safer.

17:44.643 --> 17:46.643
I'm gonna go to the hospital
to be with Mom's body.

17:47.309 --> 17:49.075
I'm gonna go hunt in the library

17:49.076 --> 17:50.252
and see if there's anything regarding

17:50.277 --> 17:51.980
the plantation house or the mirror.

17:54.009 --> 17:56.876
May, just hang tight. We're gonna
find a way to get you out of there.

18:00.376 --> 18:01.443
May.

18:02.009 --> 18:03.276
May.

18:07.976 --> 18:09.362
What the... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:09.387 --> 18:10.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?

18:10.643 --> 18:13.575
Had a few visitors of the dark
came creeping behind me.

18:13.576 --> 18:15.375
Okay, come on. We gotta get
back to the Hasting's house...

18:15.376 --> 18:17.875
No, no. No, we need
to get back to the mirror.

18:17.876 --> 18:19.008
That doesn't make any sense.

18:19.009 --> 18:20.842
We came in that way. We gotta try.

18:22.043 --> 18:24.543
Come on, before they attack again.

18:25.076 --> 18:26.309
Fine. Fine.

18:27.076 --> 18:28.142
Let me help you.

18:28.143 --> 18:30.027
Come on.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.309
All right. This way, come on. Fast.

19:07.509 --> 19:09.508
So much for staying safe at the house.

19:09.509 --> 19:10.876
You know I couldn't do that.

19:11.476 --> 19:12.742
Besides, we wanted to see

19:12.743 --> 19:14.342
what we could figure out
over here on this end.

19:14.343 --> 19:17.042
Who's "we"? Thought you're
by yourself, right?

19:17.043 --> 19:19.304
No. This is Sarah.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.943
She's gotten hurt, but...

19:22.409 --> 19:24.074
- She's...
- May.

19:24.143 --> 19:25.342
How well do you know her?

19:25.343 --> 19:26.771
I know that we both
wanna get out of here.

19:26.796 --> 19:27.906
Over here that's more than enough.

19:27.931 --> 19:30.333
So hungry.

19:30.358 --> 19:31.424
Behind you!

19:31.449 --> 19:33.315
Sarah, look... Look out! Behind you!

19:36.103 --> 19:37.170
Sarah.

19:47.176 --> 19:49.308
It's better than a Red Bull.

19:49.309 --> 19:52.343
So, May, who's your friend?

19:52.909 --> 19:54.142
What are you?

19:54.143 --> 19:58.475
I was your savior just a minute
ago and now I'm a "what"?

19:58.476 --> 20:00.408
We were getting along so well.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.975
That's why...

20:01.976 --> 20:03.912
That's why you wouldn't come
with me to the Hastings house.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.222
You would never make it past the port...

20:06.343 --> 20:09.102
You never got attacked. You just
needed to get me back here.

20:09.205 --> 20:14.451
Oh, you are smart
and commanding. I like that.

20:14.543 --> 20:17.642
Usually the people who get
trapped over in this side

20:17.643 --> 20:21.208
are just happy to be here
with some more of their kind.

20:21.209 --> 20:22.509
There are more?

20:23.009 --> 20:24.575
What did you do to them?

20:24.576 --> 20:26.042
May, get out of there.

20:26.043 --> 20:29.475
Oh, when it turns out they
don't have anything I need,

20:29.476 --> 20:31.497
I turn them into friends.

20:31.609 --> 20:34.346
- But you are different.
- How?

20:34.443 --> 20:36.376
Your body is still alive.

20:40.053 --> 20:41.409
That sure...

20:41.776 --> 20:43.043
was a first.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.643
Which should come in handy.

20:49.409 --> 20:50.842
Come in handy for what?

20:51.008 --> 20:52.175
To...

20:54.176 --> 20:55.443
get...

20:57.009 --> 20:58.142
May!

20:58.143 --> 20:59.675
...out!

21:05.276 --> 21:06.676
Mom!

21:08.176 --> 21:09.443
Mom!

21:11.909 --> 21:13.242
May, no!

21:14.543 --> 21:16.742
- Light!
- Light?

21:29.276 --> 21:30.543
May.

21:31.188 --> 21:33.160
Go back to my house.

21:35.976 --> 21:37.976
After her!

21:41.309 --> 21:42.915
I'll find her.

21:42.943 --> 21:44.509
I'll find you first.

21:44.976 --> 21:47.808
Who are you?

21:47.875 --> 21:49.749
I'm the one that's gonna put you down.

21:59.871 --> 22:02.803
Great, so you got some guys help
you bring this thing up here.

22:02.876 --> 22:05.122
And we're sure that was a good idea?

22:05.243 --> 22:08.276
Keep your friends close
and your enemy magic closer.

22:09.443 --> 22:11.708
So who or what is in there with her?

22:11.709 --> 22:14.708
According to the historical
documentation, she's a witch.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.286
A Sarah Liebeau. She lived
in the plantation home,

22:17.311 --> 22:20.775
centuries ago, where she was known
for her interest in black magic.

22:20.776 --> 22:24.275
But supposedly, she was trying
to find a way to live forever.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.508
I guess she found it,

22:25.509 --> 22:27.142
living in a mirror world.

22:27.143 --> 22:28.343
Except now she wants out.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.642
S... Something happened earlier.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.654
I saw the lights go crazy or something

22:34.744 --> 22:37.264
Oh, that's probably just the witch
trying to take over her body.

22:40.101 --> 22:42.167
Why now? Why hasn't
she done this before?

22:42.168 --> 22:44.868
We're all just learning
about this, baby.

22:45.901 --> 22:48.267
I mean, it could be that
May's the first soul

22:48.268 --> 22:51.563
to get pulled into the mirror,
whose body is still alive.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.147
From what I read, if they don't have a

22:54.172 --> 22:56.067
live body to tether them to this plane,

22:56.068 --> 23:00.268
then over time, they become lost souls.

23:01.868 --> 23:05.545
So you're telling me
that if my mom dies here,

23:05.610 --> 23:07.124
she becomes one of those ugly things

23:07.172 --> 23:08.767
that's been following her
around in there?

23:08.768 --> 23:11.867
No. No, no, Sarah needs
May to stay alive.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.378
May is not gonna die.

23:13.505 --> 23:16.768
Tilly, can you get me in there?

23:18.001 --> 23:19.500
I don't know. I mean...

23:19.501 --> 23:21.500
I might be able to, it's just,
there's a lot of risk...

23:21.501 --> 23:23.300
I need you to get me in there.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.434
Right now.

23:25.674 --> 23:26.707
Okay.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.468
Okay... Okay.

23:42.658 --> 23:44.765
I don't want you to go in there.

23:44.801 --> 23:46.573
Thought you were the one who said

23:46.598 --> 23:48.167
you wished I was in here
instead of your mom.

23:48.168 --> 23:51.700
If something happens,
you'll both be trapped.

23:51.701 --> 23:53.534
And none of us wants that, sweetie.

23:54.857 --> 23:56.090
Okay?

23:59.795 --> 24:01.016
All right.

24:07.701 --> 24:08.968
It's ready.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.767
Whoa. It's like Stargate.

24:20.768 --> 24:22.648
- Tilly.
- Oh. Yeah.

24:22.672 --> 24:24.039
Time to go.

24:27.734 --> 24:28.867
A witch bottle?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.467
These things really work?

24:30.468 --> 24:31.534
Let's hope so.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.545
Okay. Remember.

24:35.268 --> 24:37.467
- Clockwise to open. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

24:37.468 --> 24:39.933
Water along the edges before
contact with the mirror.

24:39.934 --> 24:43.305
The portal will close once
the bowl passes through.

24:43.334 --> 24:44.400
And then?

24:44.401 --> 24:46.200
If they both can come back
through the mirror...

24:46.201 --> 24:47.300
"If"?

24:47.301 --> 24:49.503
...then May's spirit will be
restored to her body,

24:49.528 --> 24:51.095
and then you will return back to us.

24:55.968 --> 24:57.733
Clockwise, right?

24:57.786 --> 24:59.434
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:00.234 --> 25:01.334
Wait.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.934
Promise me you'll both come back.

25:05.968 --> 25:07.915
Hey, I'm scared too,

25:08.001 --> 25:09.900
but it's okay, because

25:09.901 --> 25:14.067
fear is what we use to keep us careful
while we do what we have to do.

25:14.068 --> 25:16.100
And what I have to do
is go get your mom.

25:16.101 --> 25:17.300
Look...

25:17.301 --> 25:20.333
I'm sorry for what I said before, Pop.

25:20.334 --> 25:21.534
I didn't...

25:24.234 --> 25:26.733
Save the apology for when I
come back with your mom.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.112
Okay?

25:28.201 --> 25:29.868
Be safe, okay?

25:30.156 --> 25:31.855
Be safe.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.468
Right down the middle.

25:34.390 --> 25:35.957
Okay.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.201
It worked.

25:58.168 --> 25:59.234
Now.

26:38.268 --> 26:39.934
Hey. Easy.

26:40.368 --> 26:42.068
It's me.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.160
I didn't think I'd see
anybody ever again.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.006
Wait.

26:50.070 --> 26:53.067
No. No, no. No, no, no, no.
If you're here then that... What...

26:53.068 --> 26:55.617
- Are you...
- No, no. No, no. I'm fine.

26:55.701 --> 26:59.001
My body is fine. We just found out
a way for me to jump through.

27:01.434 --> 27:03.234
I'm actually surprised to see you here.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.952
You told me to come here.

27:06.063 --> 27:08.701
Yeah, but, when's the last
time you listened to me?

27:10.968 --> 27:13.433
Okay. All right. So, how do we get out?

27:13.434 --> 27:15.735
Tilly and Bea are working
on that right now,

27:15.760 --> 27:17.855
but this mirror world, there's
some things we don't understand.

27:17.958 --> 27:20.750
So you didn't even know how you
were gonna get back, and you just...

27:21.534 --> 27:23.034
jumped dimensions for me?

27:31.301 --> 27:33.318
There's still movement out there,
but it's only on this side,

27:33.319 --> 27:34.643
- so we gotta go.
- Where?

27:34.668 --> 27:36.736
To the hospital. That's where
the cursed mirror is set up,

27:36.761 --> 27:38.226
and it's the way I know
for us to jump back.

27:38.251 --> 27:39.733
Okay, but with those things out there?

27:39.734 --> 27:41.267
It's dark in here, so,

27:41.268 --> 27:43.021
we're gonna pass
through the old cemetery,

27:43.068 --> 27:45.551
and stop off at the plantation
house and stay there for cover.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.900
What if they see us, Calvin?

27:46.901 --> 27:49.341
I got a bag full of goodies.
Hopefully, that'll hold them off.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.401
Are you ready for this, Chief?

27:52.628 --> 27:55.294
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Let's go.

27:58.168 --> 27:59.567
- Wait, no, no, no.
- What?

27:59.568 --> 28:00.686
- Not that way.
- Why?

28:00.711 --> 28:02.033
There's a lot of them down there.

28:02.034 --> 28:03.933
I already used up most of
my ammo getting to you.

28:03.934 --> 28:05.533
What the hell is in this bag then?

28:05.534 --> 28:06.800
Lights.

28:06.801 --> 28:09.077
We know light from our
world affects them, so...

28:09.124 --> 28:11.878
Yeah. That's why Sarah was able
to rescue me at the hospital.

28:11.903 --> 28:12.926
She has a flashlight.

28:12.951 --> 28:14.264
She must have gotten it
from somebody who ported over

28:14.288 --> 28:16.042
- from the other side.
- Yeah.

28:16.234 --> 28:18.667
Oh, it's time for plan B.

28:18.668 --> 28:20.170
- Plantation house.
- Yeah.

28:20.195 --> 28:22.821
Yeah. It's the best chance to
make it to the hospital. Come on.

28:23.668 --> 28:26.067
Surprised those things didn't get us.

28:26.092 --> 28:28.033
Yeah. Luck always helps.

28:28.058 --> 28:29.113
Yeah.

28:29.114 --> 28:31.754
We can just hole up in here until
there's no more movement outside.

28:33.068 --> 28:36.767
So, aside from being where I died,

28:36.768 --> 28:38.216
do you remember this place?

28:38.390 --> 28:41.500
Yeah. It's where the Dunn twins used
to have all their house parties.

28:41.501 --> 28:43.267
I felt Lakisha Jones up right there.

28:43.268 --> 28:45.033
What?

28:45.034 --> 28:47.867
Come on. It was my first time.

28:47.868 --> 28:49.967
This house is not what it used to be.

28:49.968 --> 28:51.567
Who didn't feel up Lakisha Jones?

28:51.568 --> 28:53.767
- You felt up Lakisha Jones too?
- I did not.

28:53.768 --> 28:56.165
- I know you felt up Lakisha Jones.
- I did not.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.334
This is where we conceived Garvey.

29:08.568 --> 29:09.634
Really?

29:10.301 --> 29:11.401
Yeah.

29:14.668 --> 29:15.801
Come on.

29:19.068 --> 29:20.501
Maybe I should go in too.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.282
Right.

29:22.370 --> 29:25.469
Your mama didn't birth no fool.
Hmm? No one else goes in.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.186
Just checking in.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.900
Wow. It's a full house.

29:32.234 --> 29:35.667
Oh, we want her to see her
family here when she wakes up.

29:35.668 --> 29:36.601
Exactly.

29:36.602 --> 29:38.933
I'm sure she feels your presence.

29:38.934 --> 29:40.633
That's a lovely mirror.

29:40.634 --> 29:42.830
- Why is it...
- It's a family superstition.

29:42.854 --> 29:44.505
How is she doing?

29:44.634 --> 29:45.768
Um...

29:50.534 --> 29:51.767
Still stable.

29:51.768 --> 29:53.067
Great. That's good.

29:53.068 --> 29:55.168
Dr. Kim will be in later
to give you an update.

29:55.868 --> 29:57.334
Okay. Thank you.

30:01.544 --> 30:03.476
You got plans, Saturday?

30:03.501 --> 30:06.467
Really? Can we talk about
that once we get out of here?

30:06.468 --> 30:08.167
Well, I just figured,
while I had your full attention,

30:08.168 --> 30:09.754
it might be a good time
for us to make a date.

30:09.779 --> 30:11.400
You are really feeling yourself.

30:11.401 --> 30:13.634
Let's just concentrate on
where we're at now, okay?

30:19.968 --> 30:23.127
After everything we've been
through since I've been back.

30:23.201 --> 30:25.500
What does it take to
earn some trust around here?

30:25.501 --> 30:26.733
Earn some trust?

30:26.734 --> 30:28.533
How am I supposed to trust the
guy who lies to the police

30:28.534 --> 30:30.033
about harboring a wanted criminal, huh?

30:30.034 --> 30:31.600
"Allegedly."

30:31.601 --> 30:32.800
Okay.

30:32.801 --> 30:34.567
Was that alleged as your
military record being sealed

30:34.568 --> 30:37.834
or the mysteriously missing three years?
How about that?

30:39.334 --> 30:41.133
You run a background check on me?

30:41.134 --> 30:42.300
I didn't.

30:42.301 --> 30:43.467
Your daughter did.

30:43.468 --> 30:46.191
What she found was
mostly redacted, so...

30:46.301 --> 30:49.334
If you care to share,
now would be a great time.

30:50.368 --> 30:51.901
This is a good spot for us to hold up.

30:52.868 --> 30:54.033
Yeah.

30:54.034 --> 30:55.367
Change the subject.

30:55.368 --> 30:57.233
You can go on and on
all you want about trust.

30:57.234 --> 30:59.800
I have plenty of it. It's just reserved
for people who are trustworthy.

30:59.801 --> 31:02.300
Woman, where I've been
the last couple of years

31:02.379 --> 31:04.734
has nothing to do with
who I am right now.

31:06.688 --> 31:07.887
Really?

31:07.968 --> 31:09.467
But if you wanna presume

31:09.468 --> 31:12.601
guilt over innocence, then I
guess that's just where we are.

31:18.134 --> 31:19.534
Oh, God!

31:24.001 --> 31:25.400
Oh, my God!

31:27.868 --> 31:29.534
Oh, my God!

31:38.734 --> 31:40.067
Okay, here, take this.

31:40.068 --> 31:41.567
I don't have enough
bullets for all of them,

31:41.568 --> 31:42.733
- so we're gonna have to light 'em up.
- All right.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.867
- Got it?
- Yeah.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.533
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

31:54.268 --> 31:55.467
Come on!

31:55.468 --> 31:57.034
Come on!

31:58.542 --> 31:59.976
Come on! Come on!

32:11.081 --> 32:13.081
Okay. Okay, okay.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.967
So...

32:17.968 --> 32:21.628
She really... She really
held you a goodbye?

32:22.101 --> 32:24.429
And not to pick my pockets either.

32:24.636 --> 32:26.500
Thought she was gonna push
me through the damn mirror.

32:26.501 --> 32:27.801
Hilarious.

32:28.938 --> 32:30.437
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

32:30.501 --> 32:32.168
Truth moment.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.612
How's my baby girl?

32:34.701 --> 32:35.933
Your young woman

32:36.100 --> 32:38.434
is doing just fine.
She's got your spirit.

32:39.696 --> 32:40.895
So listen,

32:40.968 --> 32:43.605
if I don't make it back,
I... I... I need

32:43.768 --> 32:45.033
for you to, um...

32:45.089 --> 32:46.400
- May...
- Uh, no, listen.

32:46.401 --> 32:47.700
My body is over there on life support.

32:47.701 --> 32:49.534
Can you tell me the doctors
can bring me back?

32:51.901 --> 32:53.658
Tell her that...

32:53.901 --> 32:54.967
I love her.

32:54.968 --> 32:56.777
Tell her that she can...

32:56.901 --> 32:59.933
She can be anything she wants
to be in this world, okay?

32:59.934 --> 33:02.234
Tell her yourself, okay?

33:04.268 --> 33:05.800
Come on.

33:05.801 --> 33:07.168
I'm gonna get you back.

33:37.134 --> 33:38.468
Right here.

33:41.968 --> 33:44.178
- All right, May? Hold this.
- Uh?

33:44.535 --> 33:46.105
What?

33:49.934 --> 33:51.868
- You see 'em?
- Yeah.

33:55.454 --> 33:57.076
Okay.

33:58.653 --> 34:01.634
Come on, come on, come on.

34:01.658 --> 34:03.433
Yeah.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.149
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.433
Let's go.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.333
Saying goodbye?

34:19.134 --> 34:21.268
I've been waiting for you.

34:21.598 --> 34:22.797
What do you want?

34:22.909 --> 34:24.409
Same thing as you.

34:25.768 --> 34:27.367
To go home.

34:27.368 --> 34:30.952
My body on the other side
is decayed and gone,

34:31.134 --> 34:32.634
but yours will do fine.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.489
I'll treat it well.

34:35.543 --> 34:36.734
I don't think so.

34:48.068 --> 34:49.368
Go.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.751
Go.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.701
Where do you think you're going?

35:01.722 --> 35:03.400
It's happening again.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.333
The witch is trying
to take over her body.

35:05.334 --> 35:07.467
If she manages to cross
over, we can banish her.

35:07.468 --> 35:08.833
But she'd be in Mom's body.

35:08.834 --> 35:10.178
We gotta kill May.

35:10.534 --> 35:11.601
What?

35:28.801 --> 35:30.133
It's gone.

35:34.221 --> 35:35.820
You killed my mom?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.334
Well, just a little bit.

35:41.101 --> 35:42.767
It's not working!

35:42.768 --> 35:44.334
What have you done?

35:48.401 --> 35:51.085
Okay, so, how do we know when
it's safe to bring her back?

35:55.288 --> 35:56.555
That works for me.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.100
Whoa. What do you think you're doing?

36:05.101 --> 36:06.400
She's crashing.

36:06.401 --> 36:08.693
- Stop!
- I'm a doctor.

36:08.768 --> 36:09.933
You're not her doctor.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.568
I don't think she'll mind.

36:12.434 --> 36:14.233
May has a do not resuscitate order.

36:14.234 --> 36:15.411
Those are her wishes.

36:15.436 --> 36:17.916
Eddie, I have power of attorney, okay?
We're bringing her back.

36:18.034 --> 36:19.301
Clear.

36:20.534 --> 36:22.034
- Security!
- Eddie!

36:22.862 --> 36:24.458
- Up in the joules.
- Oh, come on.

36:26.301 --> 36:28.801
- Come on.
- Come on, recharge.

36:31.834 --> 36:32.934
Clear!

36:34.230 --> 36:35.463
May!

36:35.534 --> 36:36.601
Now!

36:37.601 --> 36:39.268
No!

36:44.214 --> 36:46.033
Oh, my God, Mom.

36:46.034 --> 36:47.167
She's back.

36:47.168 --> 36:48.367
She's back.

36:48.368 --> 36:49.801
Well done.

36:55.368 --> 36:57.656
I am going to take my time

36:57.768 --> 36:59.450
and savor killing you.

36:59.529 --> 37:00.701
Savor this.

37:01.701 --> 37:02.834
No!

37:08.529 --> 37:09.895
My powers!

37:09.968 --> 37:12.286
They're all in this bottle.

37:12.334 --> 37:13.921
Now it's your choice.

37:13.968 --> 37:15.100
You can let me pass,

37:15.143 --> 37:17.794
or I will bust a rune cap
in your witch-ass.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.001
Your choice.

37:27.268 --> 37:28.900
- Calvin!
- Is she okay?

37:28.901 --> 37:30.500
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

37:30.501 --> 37:31.874
I don't understand. The portal should be

37:31.899 --> 37:33.247
closed, but it's still unstable.

37:33.272 --> 37:35.081
Something else must
be trying to get through.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.367
It's her.

37:43.368 --> 37:46.930
We're safe. She needs her own
living tissue to get on this side.

37:47.034 --> 37:48.922
Like this hair in the bottle?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.368
She senses it.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.401
Oh, God.

37:52.901 --> 37:54.334
Whoa!

37:55.505 --> 37:56.572
Oh...

37:56.911 --> 37:58.636
It's amazing.

37:59.834 --> 38:00.901
Tilly!

38:10.345 --> 38:12.433
Maybe there's something in the book.

38:12.434 --> 38:14.151
- Stand.
- Stand. Stand.

38:14.234 --> 38:15.668
All right, stay back.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.234
What happened in here?

38:26.434 --> 38:27.701
May?

38:28.368 --> 38:29.768
Thank God.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.701
This is amazing.

38:35.886 --> 38:37.453
Hey, it's okay.

38:37.915 --> 38:39.414
Cancel that order.

38:39.439 --> 38:41.599
They're staying, could youget
someone to clean that up?

38:57.634 --> 39:00.701
The scans show no long-term
damage to the brain.

39:00.946 --> 39:02.301
It's a miracle.

39:03.438 --> 39:05.033
She'll make a full recovery.

39:05.034 --> 39:07.500
I do wanna keep you for another 24 hours

39:07.501 --> 39:09.334
for observation, just to be safe.

39:10.168 --> 39:11.801
You're always looking out.

39:12.234 --> 39:13.601
Thank you, Eddie.

39:18.634 --> 39:20.100
I'm so glad you're back, Mom.

39:20.101 --> 39:21.767
Me too.

39:21.768 --> 39:22.867
What was it like in there?

39:22.868 --> 39:26.134
Like a fun house, minus all the fun.

39:27.134 --> 39:28.801
You must be exhausted, baby.

39:29.459 --> 39:31.526
Let's let her get some rest, okay?

39:32.501 --> 39:34.568
- I love you.
- I love you too.

39:46.168 --> 39:48.167
Come on, move over, hips.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.801
Worried about my hips?

39:50.734 --> 39:52.168
Be careful with this.

39:53.301 --> 39:54.900
It's worse than it looks.

39:59.748 --> 40:02.147
I'm gonna have to stay away from you.

40:02.268 --> 40:03.867
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:03.868 --> 40:04.900
Why?

40:04.901 --> 40:08.667
You have seven years of bad luck.

40:08.668 --> 40:11.234
You broke that big old mirror.

40:13.434 --> 40:15.068
I feel pretty lucky right now.

40:16.368 --> 40:17.701
I almost lost you.

40:18.634 --> 40:20.668
I'm not that easy to lose.

40:24.834 --> 40:28.799
So, about what I said about
you not being trustworthy,

40:28.868 --> 40:30.861
- I was completely... No.
- You were right.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.809
I'm not exactly
top-shelf father material.

40:32.834 --> 40:35.701
Don't say that. I never
gave you a chance to try.

40:37.001 --> 40:38.533
And I want you to.

40:38.534 --> 40:40.282
I think we should

40:40.534 --> 40:43.600
forget the past, focus on the present.

40:43.601 --> 40:46.131
I mean, that's really
all we have, right?

40:47.401 --> 40:48.834
Sounds like a plan.

40:49.061 --> 40:50.160
Okay.

40:50.201 --> 40:51.268
Okay.

40:54.901 --> 40:56.734
I'm gonna let you get some rest.

40:57.301 --> 40:58.401
Yeah.

41:04.934 --> 41:07.608
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

41:07.801 --> 41:09.664
You take that mirror with you.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.234
I don't wanna see
any mirrors for a while.

41:13.901 --> 41:15.668
- Really?
- Go ahead. Get it.

41:23.057 --> 41:24.650
Yes, ma'am.

41:38.701 --> 41:40.101
That the witch's bottle?

41:43.934 --> 41:45.367
Even though the witch is dead,

41:45.492 --> 41:48.230
we should probably
keep an eye on her powers.

41:48.492 --> 41:50.401
Keep your enemy magic close, right?

41:51.168 --> 41:52.234
Right.

41:54.201 --> 41:55.268
What?

41:57.146 --> 41:58.779
Nothing. I'm just...

41:58.868 --> 42:00.401
glad to have you in my life.

42:01.868 --> 42:04.100
And you called me "Pops,"
so there's that.

42:04.101 --> 42:05.467
I don't think so.

42:05.468 --> 42:06.733
There were witnesses.

42:06.768 --> 42:08.534
Slip of the tongue.

42:08.644 --> 42:10.979
Saving my mom doesn't make me
your number one fan,

42:11.003 --> 42:12.709
so get over yourself.

42:12.768 --> 42:14.333
You are definitely May's daughter.

42:14.334 --> 42:16.101
Whatever. Dinner's ready.

42:17.301 --> 42:18.401
Hey, Garvey.

42:21.901 --> 42:23.501
I told you I'd bring her back.

42:25.201 --> 42:26.268
Yeah.

42:27.401 --> 42:28.768
Yeah, you did.

42:30.368 --> 42:32.001
Maybe there is hope for you,

42:32.568 --> 42:33.801
Calvin.
