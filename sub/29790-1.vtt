00:36.578 --> 00:38.496
<i>This is an important safety alert</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:40.331
<i>from Pacific Gas and Electric Company.</i>

00:41.332 --> 00:44.335
<i>Extreme weather conditions</i>
<i>and high fire danger</i>

00:44.669 --> 00:46.087
<i>are forecasted in...</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:48.381
<i>Butte County.</i>

00:50.091 --> 00:53.428
<i>Starting this Thursday, November 8,</i>

00:53.511 --> 00:54.971
<i>-2018.</i>

00:57.390 --> 00:59.059
<i>To protect public safety,</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:04.105
<i>PG&E may also temporarily turn off power</i>
<i>in your neighborhood or community.</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.240
<i>Please have your emergency plan ready.</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:25.835
Well, the night before...

01:27.128 --> 01:28.379
I heard a... a news flick.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.215
It said, um, it's gonna be...

01:31.633 --> 01:33.176
It's gonna be a really windy day.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.054
Skies are clear
over Northern California today,

01:36.137 --> 01:39.766
but it is gonna be
a very dangerous day for fire danger

01:39.849 --> 01:41.309
and due to the stronger winds.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.980
So I told my wife Jennifer, I says,
"I'm gonna staff the water tender.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.274
So I'm gonna go up to station 33.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.693
I'm gonna staff the water tender."

01:50.777 --> 01:51.611
So, I...

01:51.820 --> 01:52.904
I spent the night...

01:54.155 --> 01:55.990
that night, at 33,

01:56.282 --> 01:58.493
and, um, just, in my mind...

02:00.036 --> 02:00.870
it just...

02:01.788 --> 02:03.248
it just didn't feel right.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.418
Normal night shift
is 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.297
And it was quiet. I just remember
that night being really quiet.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.009
I was a half an hour away from going home.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.096
Then my supervisor came over about 5:30.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.223
He took the 911 call.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.350
<i>Fire rescue.</i>

02:22.767 --> 02:26.229
The caller was a PG&E employee
from the Poe Powerhouse.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.564
They were very matter-of-fact

02:27.647 --> 02:30.608
about what they were seeing, what they
were reporting, and it's a Pulga fire.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.569
It's a really remote area.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.529
They're common, and we had the winds.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.032
I remember saying, "Oh, okay, might have
to hold over for an hour or two,

02:38.116 --> 02:39.909
'cause we've got a little fire,
no big deal.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.453
Just right before I go off shift,
and okay, no big deal."

02:42.537 --> 02:44.664
The red flag warning in place
through tomorrow morning,

02:44.747 --> 02:46.583
wind advisory in place
through late tonight,

02:46.666 --> 02:49.377
and then we do see some pleasant changes
on the way for your weekend.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.464
I was laying in bed with my oldest son,

02:53.548 --> 02:54.674
who had a fever.

02:54.757 --> 02:58.845
My mom had come up to pick up
my youngest to take him down to school,

02:59.345 --> 03:01.389
and on their drive said, "Hey,

03:02.557 --> 03:05.351
we see a plume of smoke,
and it doesn't look good."

03:05.768 --> 03:07.937
<i>Fire rescue.</i>
<i>What is the address of the emergency?</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:10.190
<i>I'm headed up to Paradise.</i>
<i>Should I turn around?</i>

03:10.273 --> 03:13.526
<i>We do have a large fire</i>
<i>down in the Pulga and Concow area.</i>

03:13.610 --> 03:16.112
<i>It is not, at this moment,</i>
<i>threatening Paradise.</i>

03:16.196 --> 03:20.742
At about seven, I called our duty chief,
uh, Chief Messina,

03:20.825 --> 03:24.078
and said, "You know, hey, I'm hearing
this thing's, like, 200 acres,"

03:24.162 --> 03:25.872
and he said, "Yeah, I'm heading out there.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.583
Just hang on. I'll give you a call,
maybe in an hour, if I need you."

03:29.584 --> 03:32.212
Five minutes later, my phone rang,
and he said, "Get on the road."

03:32.420 --> 03:34.589
He said he could see flames
from the valley.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.471
We dispatched a response. I dispatched it.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.181
I actually named it,

03:43.264 --> 03:46.601
which has been
a nightmare to deal with

03:46.684 --> 03:49.145
because everybody's like,
"Why is it the Camp Fire?"

03:49.229 --> 03:52.732
And it's like, okay, there are reasons
it's named why it's named.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.735
Like there's specific criteria
we have to follow.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.445
And...

04:00.365 --> 04:01.950
It just seemed like a normal...

04:03.534 --> 04:05.995
It just seemed like a normal fire
at first.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.248
And, uh...

04:12.335 --> 04:13.795
It got bad real quick.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.137
I got to school,

04:23.388 --> 04:26.683
and I didn't notice anything
when I pulled in,

04:26.766 --> 04:29.269
but then, immediately
after I got to my classroom,

04:29.352 --> 04:32.272
-I noticed kind of a frenzy.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.900
In just a matter of 20 minutes,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.611
what looked like a calm sky was...

04:39.445 --> 04:40.446
it was orange.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.995
I go to the police department.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.664
I meet up with my partner,
who is in training.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.082
Um...

04:51.499 --> 04:52.917
And we're in a two-man car,

04:53.001 --> 04:56.796
and we're literally in the back lot,
and all this ash is just raining down.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.758
And it... it gave you the feeling
of, like, being under a volcano.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.263
Hear that? That's...
That's ash coming down.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.889
It's not rain.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.601
It's ash.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.396
Goddammit.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.859
<i>Hello, fire rescue.</i>
<i>What is the address of the emergency?</i>

05:17.942 --> 05:21.571
<i>All I can see is the whole area here</i>
<i>is covered in black-- In smoke.</i>

05:21.654 --> 05:23.156
<i>We started getting calls,</i>

05:23.239 --> 05:25.450
<i>that we're reporting</i>
<i>to the incident commander,</i>

05:25.533 --> 05:26.826
<i>of houses on fire.</i>

05:28.036 --> 05:30.538
<i>Fire rescue.</i>
<i>What is the address of the emergency?</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:33.291
<i>Okay. Are you in the Concow area?</i>

05:33.374 --> 05:35.835
- <i>Yes, ma'am, I am.</i>
<i>-Go ahead and evacuate, please.</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.755
<i>It's... It's in my yard.</i>

05:38.838 --> 05:43.426
It was in the Concow area,
and I'm like, "Okay, that seems...

05:43.509 --> 05:46.220
reasonable
for where this fire started, I guess."

05:46.304 --> 05:50.808
<i>Hello. I'm calling about fire</i>
<i>and smoke and orange glow in the sky.</i>

05:50.892 --> 05:52.560
<i>If you're threatened by the fire,</i>

05:52.643 --> 05:55.438
<i>then you should evacuate,</i>
<i>even if you haven't been notified.</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:57.482
<i>Fire rescue.</i>
<i>What is the address of the emergency?</i>

05:57.565 --> 06:00.109
<i>Ma'am, go ahead and evacuate. We have</i>
<i>the fire department en route.</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:01.027
<i>What's your address?</i>

06:01.110 --> 06:02.904
<i>I'm trying,</i>
<i>but it's blocking the road.</i>

06:02.987 --> 06:05.406
- <i>Ma'am, get out as fast as you can.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:05.490 --> 06:08.785
We just had so much we had to do
on our side. So many notifications,

06:08.868 --> 06:11.371
911 calls that we're taking,
resources that we're trying to order,

06:11.454 --> 06:13.081
radio traffic we're trying to answer...

06:13.164 --> 06:14.248
Engine 941.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.793
At one point,
someone in the background said,

06:16.876 --> 06:20.213
"I just took a call
for a house on fire on Sawmill Road."

06:20.838 --> 06:22.548
And I'm like, "In Paradise?"

06:23.424 --> 06:25.551
<i>Fire rescue.</i>
<i>What is the address of the emergency?</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:28.346
<i>A fire just started,</i>
<i>just kind of...</i>

06:28.429 --> 06:31.974
<i>that's where Sawmill Peak</i>
<i>comes down on Concow.</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:33.768
<i>I can see the flames.</i>
<i>It's getting started.</i>

06:33.851 --> 06:36.729
<i>Ma'am, it's...</i>
<i>We have a large fire in that area.</i>

06:36.813 --> 06:39.982
<i>-We're already in the area.</i>
- <i>No, this is new flames, lady.</i>

06:43.069 --> 06:45.988
I mean, that's not far from my house,
and I said, "No."

06:46.072 --> 06:48.491
And they said, "Yes, Paradise,"
and I said, "No."

06:48.741 --> 06:50.618
And they're like,
"Yes, Sawmill Road in Paradise.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.453
There's a house on fire,
structures on fire."

06:52.537 --> 06:53.996
I said, "From this?"

06:55.081 --> 06:56.874
<i>Uh, spot fires in Paradise.</i>

06:56.958 --> 06:59.335
<i>And we have spot fire ash</i>
<i>going everywhere.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:00.920
<i>Spotting on the Paradise side.</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:03.381
<i>You have multiple spots</i>
<i>on the Paradise side of the ridge now.</i>

07:03.464 --> 07:04.424
<i>It's in my yard.</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:07.135
<i>There's a big-ass fire</i>
<i>on Hog Ranch Road.</i>

07:07.218 --> 07:09.262
<i>Sir, we have</i>
<i>a major fire in Concow.</i>

07:09.345 --> 07:10.596
<i>That's all I can tell you, okay?</i>

07:10.680 --> 07:13.307
<i>Do you know where in Concow?</i>
<i>My father-in-law lives up there.</i>

07:13.391 --> 07:14.892
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:17.687
- <i>It's everywhere?</i>
- <i>Everywhere. A major fire.</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:19.939
<i>It's already crossed into Paradise.</i>
<i>Sir, I've gotta go.</i>

07:22.191 --> 07:23.943
I'm immediately dispatched to a spot fire,

07:24.026 --> 07:25.695
and that spot fire's
in the middle of town.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.947
<i>It's just getting big</i>
<i>by the second.</i>

07:28.030 --> 07:31.367
<i>It's like my whole backyard's smoking.</i>
<i>It's coming up to my house.</i>

07:31.909 --> 07:35.621
<i>Could anyone come on Pentz Road right now</i>
<i>and come to my house and stop it?</i>

07:36.831 --> 07:42.003
At the intersection of <i> </i> Pentz and Skyway,

07:42.378 --> 07:43.838
we got stuck in traffic.

07:44.839 --> 07:49.177
And I thought, "Well, this is really weird
because we're leaving so early."

07:50.720 --> 07:51.929
So, we're waiting.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.849
Five minutes, ten minutes,

07:54.932 --> 07:57.477
20 minutes, 40 minutes.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.896
I kill the engine. We're still waiting.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.147
I'm thinking...

08:02.315 --> 08:04.358
Something's not right. Like, we...

08:04.442 --> 08:07.069
This is not a normal evacuation.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.280
This is not what I expected.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.450
Now, suddenly, this is a huge, huge threat

08:12.533 --> 08:15.786
to me, and my kid, and my puppy.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.165
This is fucking wild.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.463
You all right, Wilbur?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.298
It's just you and me, buddy.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.426
Look at you. You good boy.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.511
We'll be all right.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.889
We'll be all right.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.558
I'm pretty sure we'll be all right.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.605
I could see the plume of smoke coming...

08:43.773 --> 08:44.899
from where I was.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.984
It was just... It was eerie.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.153
It was just like a big monster.

08:54.158 --> 08:57.745
I called my wife. Says, "Hey, this is it.
This is what we talked about, okay?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.330
You need to get out with the kids."

08:59.413 --> 09:00.998
And I says, "If my phone dies,

09:01.666 --> 09:02.750
I love you."

09:04.418 --> 09:06.837
in the cars around me,

09:06.921 --> 09:09.173
people that I know
and I've gone to school with,

09:09.257 --> 09:11.133
and, you know, everyone's just packed up

09:11.217 --> 09:13.844
and just trying to get out
for their lives,

09:13.928 --> 09:15.972
and it just felt unreal that...

09:17.014 --> 09:19.809
this is actually happening,
that our town is on fire,

09:20.351 --> 09:21.352
and just so fast.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.398
<i>They're evacuating</i>
<i>the entire town of Paradise.</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:27.441
<i>It's about 40,000 people.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:33.197
<i>I knew it was bad.</i>
<i>I knew it was really, really dangerous.</i>

09:34.073 --> 09:36.367
<i>We had children running in</i>
<i>off the playground</i>

09:36.450 --> 09:38.911
<i>saying that branches were landing on fire.</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:41.080
<i>The wind was so strong.</i>

09:41.622 --> 09:45.001
And one parent looked at me,
with the children on the floor,

09:45.084 --> 09:48.713
and said, "Get out. Get out now.
Get these kids out of here."

09:49.922 --> 09:52.550
I led the kids out towards the bus,

09:52.967 --> 09:55.636
and, um, we started loading.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.765
- <i>Are they evacuating the kids?</i>
- <i>We are evacuating the kids, yes.</i>

09:59.849 --> 10:01.851
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>
<i>Just do the best you can, okay?</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:03.644
- <i>Okay, thank you.</i>
- <i>Bye bye.</i>

10:04.604 --> 10:07.106
My boss had walked up to me and asked

10:07.732 --> 10:09.942
if I would get on the bus, um,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.695
and then Mary, the other teacher
who'd been on the bus at the time

10:12.778 --> 10:15.448
was also asking,
and to be honest with you,

10:15.531 --> 10:18.659
I kind of was in shock
and froze up a little bit.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.788
I was terrified,
but I looked onto that bus

10:22.872 --> 10:24.415
and I could see my students' faces,

10:24.498 --> 10:26.667
and you can hear kids crying,
and it just...

10:27.793 --> 10:30.212
I knew I had to be on the bus.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.716
I just felt like I needed
to get on there with them.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.553
I was scared. I didn't want...
I didn't want to, but I did.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.512
I felt like...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.891
That I needed to stay with the kids.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.895
And then, we... we started,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.899
and immediately,
the first corner we hit, there was fire,

10:50.566 --> 10:53.110
and we were stuck in traffic.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.206
It was hot,
very, very hot inside the bus.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.248
Very smoky.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.920
We were stopped by the McDonald's,

11:11.754 --> 11:14.382
and McDonald's caught on fire,

11:14.757 --> 11:18.344
and then, you see another fire
directly across the street.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.263
And then, it went completely black.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.228
The kids were asking us,
"Teacher, what time is it?"

11:27.311 --> 11:30.481
And we're like,
"It's, you know, ten o'clock."

11:31.315 --> 11:34.068
"At night?" they asked.
"Is it ten o'clock at night?"

11:35.611 --> 11:37.613
Okay, keep your windows rolled up.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.365
Holy cow, that's hot.

11:40.991 --> 11:41.826
My wife...

11:43.119 --> 11:44.453
She did everything she...

11:46.122 --> 11:48.416
She was crying, and screaming, and...

11:48.749 --> 11:50.543
It's okay, you guys. It's okay.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.253
Keep going.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.506
She was stuck in traffic,
and I told her,

11:55.589 --> 11:57.383
"Jennifer, you've gotta do
everything you can."

11:57.883 --> 11:58.884
- Come on!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.636
My phone, it just, like, cut out.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.390
And I thought, "This might be
the last time I see her, my kids."

12:09.103 --> 12:10.104
Oh, fuck.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.815
We were just...
just sitting ducks for a long time,

12:12.898 --> 12:14.859
and my daughter was panicking,

12:14.942 --> 12:17.111
and, you know, I just had to reassure her
we were fine.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.573
Come on!

12:21.991 --> 12:23.492
"Mom, we have to stay calm.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.036
No matter what, I'm gonna try my hardest

12:26.495 --> 12:27.621
for me not to die."

12:27.705 --> 12:29.540
I said, "I'm not dying today."

12:30.124 --> 12:31.584
I said, "Today is not my day."

12:37.131 --> 12:40.634
I just prayed,
and I said, "We're gonna be okay."

12:44.764 --> 12:47.349
Heavenly Father, please help us.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.978
Please help us to be safe.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.942
<i>Fire rescue.</i>
<i>What's the address for the emergency?</i>

12:59.820 --> 13:02.448
There was just call, after call,
after call, after call.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.867
<i>Please leave the area, okay?</i>

13:04.950 --> 13:07.203
- <i>Fire has jumped the road.</i>
- <i>Fire rescue.</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:10.456
<i>We have a guy calling, his wife's</i>
<i>in surgery and the hospital's on fire.</i>

13:10.706 --> 13:13.209
For the people who say
their house isn't yet on fire,

13:13.292 --> 13:16.670
or their neighborhood isn't yet on fire,
or they have a car, it was,

13:16.754 --> 13:17.797
"You have to get out.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.965
We... No one can come to help you.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.009
We don't have anybody
to come and help you."

13:24.929 --> 13:27.765
I ran out in my Skechers
and my pajamas.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.851
My son was behind me,

13:30.935 --> 13:34.855
and we got out of St. Peters Court
onto Sawmill,

13:35.564 --> 13:39.109
and, um, at that point,
I was running out of breath.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.405
And I'm standing there breathing,
and my son's watching me,

13:43.906 --> 13:45.157
and he says...

13:45.908 --> 13:49.578
He put his hand in my back,
and he says, "You've gotta run now, Mama.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.496
Run now!"

13:51.205 --> 13:52.164
And pushed me.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.167
And, you know,
when I turned around and looked,

13:55.709 --> 14:00.214
this big tree fell
right where I had been standing.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.132
My son saved my life.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.764
I just felt like you could just
hear the fear in these people's voices,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.307
and just the desperation,

14:10.391 --> 14:14.270
and you just want to be there with them,
and you can't, and...

14:15.938 --> 14:19.859
Then you have to tell them, "I have to go
because I have to take another call."

14:27.658 --> 14:32.037
We took a left,
and then made our way down to Roe Road.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.915
Roe is a very narrow road,

14:35.666 --> 14:39.128
very thick with...
with trees on both sides.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.546
Lots of fuel for the fire.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.843
When we got stuck on that road,

14:46.343 --> 14:49.013
and you could see
that the exit was on fire,

14:50.306 --> 14:54.810
that's when the first moment
of deep hopelessness came.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.532
We're trying to keep them
from looking out the window.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.288
<i>The bus really started to fill up</i>
<i>with smoke in that area.</i>

15:14.371 --> 15:17.041
<i>It was very black, thick smoke.</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:22.755
And the kids
were really getting lethargic,

15:23.172 --> 15:27.885
and some of the littler kids
were falling asleep and getting sleepy.

15:28.218 --> 15:32.014
So I ran up to the front of the bus,
and I told Kevin, the bus driver,

15:32.097 --> 15:36.018
that there were a lot of kids telling me
that they were starting to get tired.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.229
He didn't even think about it.
He took his shirt off,

15:39.313 --> 15:41.148
and he tore it
into a bunch of little pieces,

15:41.231 --> 15:43.901
and he said, "We're going to turn these
into filters for the kids

15:43.984 --> 15:45.402
so that they could breathe."

15:46.028 --> 15:48.822
We had one water bottle on the bus,
and it was in my purse,

15:48.906 --> 15:51.659
so we really rationed that water...

15:52.076 --> 15:55.120
um, to create wet little filters

15:55.204 --> 15:59.541
so every kid and adult on the bus
could breathe.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.297
At that point,
I was dealing with the children,

16:05.381 --> 16:07.174
and Abbie sat next to me,

16:07.257 --> 16:09.009
and she said,

16:09.343 --> 16:11.428
"Mary, I don't... I don't think
we're gonna get out."

16:11.762 --> 16:13.847
Take little breaths.
Little breaths.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.519
We were trying to hide emotion
from the children,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.605
and we kind of held each other, and, um...

16:22.398 --> 16:23.607
we held hands.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.361
And... so, I was trying
to be strong for her,

16:27.444 --> 16:29.697
but I wasn't feeling strong on the inside.

16:30.906 --> 16:31.782
And, um...

16:32.533 --> 16:34.118
And that's when we prayed.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.998
It's hard to say this out loud,

16:42.209 --> 16:44.253
but we... we prayed that we...

16:44.461 --> 16:46.380
we would die of smoke inhalation.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.801
And that's a hard prayer to make,
you know, to do,

16:51.635 --> 16:54.263
as we held each other and held hands.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.727
And then we took...

17:00.310 --> 17:01.145
a...

17:01.228 --> 17:04.147
a deep breath to refocus ourselves, and...

17:05.441 --> 17:08.234
we got back to work.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.778
We really got back to work.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.244
- Thirty, 29.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.122
Go ahead, 30.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.666
We actually went up Pentz Road,
and it's two lanes.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.838
So, we literally kind of weaved our way
through traffic, splitting the lanes,

17:28.464 --> 17:31.467
with the purpose of getting to Skyway
and Clark Road.

17:33.343 --> 17:37.306
Having worked that town a long time,
I knew that intersection was a mess.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.686
We get where Clark intersects with Skyway,

17:43.353 --> 17:44.688
and then, we stop again,

17:44.772 --> 17:47.441
and it's another five minutes,
ten minutes.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.651
Ma'am, we're not going anywhere.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.654
And I'm thinking, "This isn't right.
Why aren't we moving?"

17:53.238 --> 17:56.241
There was about 150 people
in the middle of the street.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.534
Complete gridlock,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.578
and the fire front was coming.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.165
If you look down Skyway,
which is the escape route,

18:03.248 --> 18:04.333
it's already on fire.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.627
We're blocked both directions.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.837
We are stuck here right now,
all of us, okay?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.255
-Are we gonna be okay?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.299
Sir, just pull up
behind that red car.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.970
We hear a sheriff's
car come through over the loudspeaker.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.806
He says,

18:19.264 --> 18:24.144
"Prepare to abandon your vehicles
and proceed on foot."

18:28.273 --> 18:30.567
I was in utter disbelief.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.361
Out of your cars!

18:33.987 --> 18:36.865
Evacuate on foot! Evacuate on foot!

18:37.199 --> 18:38.575
Get out of your cars!

18:39.118 --> 18:42.287
Optimo parking lot.
Optimo parking lot. Stop.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.914
Get out of your car.

18:43.997 --> 18:47.000
I thought, "This can't be right.
We can't be safer...

18:47.334 --> 18:48.836
on foot."

18:49.837 --> 18:51.839
On foot. Optimo parking lot.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.676
The fire was coming pretty... pretty hard.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.512
Probably 80, 100-foot flames
coming down the Skyway,

18:59.138 --> 19:02.266
and it was just crushing
all those buildings as it was coming.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.436
<i>We're all standing</i>
<i>out in the street,</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:08.105
<i>right next to a gas station...</i>

19:08.188 --> 19:09.273
What is that?

19:09.481 --> 19:12.317
<i>...and a wall of fire</i>
<i>is coming at us.</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:15.821
I hear my kids' teeth chatter.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.576
Fuck me, Kyle.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.329
There were balls of fire that big
like you hear about in the Bible.

19:24.746 --> 19:28.792
You hear that, you know...
fire from heaven and all that stuff.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.877
And I...

19:30.419 --> 19:34.798
never thought I'd see embers and fireballs
coming out of the sky.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.473
We came up with a plan
to put people in the parking lot.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.102
Right across the intersection,
there is a great big cement pad

19:47.186 --> 19:48.520
that had just been poured.

19:49.104 --> 19:52.733
We gathered on that little lot.
There was nowhere else to go.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.529
I tried to get a couple
of helicopters to come in and drop on us,

19:57.613 --> 20:00.282
and, uh, they had two drops
that were really high.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.117
Didn't really have any effect.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.953
I had to kind of change that gear...

20:05.704 --> 20:08.040
and understand
that I wasn't going to put this fire out.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.668
One of our, uh, firefighters
was up there by himself.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.463
I said, "Hey, start breaking
into these buildings over here,

20:14.546 --> 20:16.340
and we're gonna start
putting them in there."

20:25.933 --> 20:29.144
The field right behind that slab,
we found out,

20:29.228 --> 20:32.064
was a propane tank storage field,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.775
so those started to explode.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.408
Every ten seconds,
it was boom, boom.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.746
I've never been in a war, but...

20:49.539 --> 20:51.375
I don't... You can't... You don't...

20:51.458 --> 20:54.378
That sound,
when something is that loud...

20:56.296 --> 20:58.340
it shakes you inside.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.634
Uh, you feel it more than you hear it,

21:00.926 --> 21:02.636
and it was constant.

21:05.097 --> 21:09.017
Firefighters told us,
"There literally is nowhere else to go.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.521
We are surrounded,
we are going to be surrounded,

21:13.021 --> 21:15.732
and our hope for survival

21:16.149 --> 21:18.443
is going to be laying down,

21:18.527 --> 21:20.904
taking cover on this cement slab."

21:22.990 --> 21:25.534
People were screaming,
and someone was singing.

21:25.784 --> 21:29.621
The propane tanks are blowing up,
and there's no way out.

21:32.708 --> 21:37.587
People don't typically survive
in a situation like this, right?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.967
You kind of go through that process
of thinking like, "Wow, like...

21:43.385 --> 21:44.261
I...

21:44.720 --> 21:46.346
I wasn't able to save my kid."

21:48.265 --> 21:49.891
And then, of course, you think,

21:49.975 --> 21:52.686
"And then how's the rest of this
gonna play out?"

21:57.065 --> 22:00.652
At that point, what do you do, right?
We're under this blanket.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.323
He grabs my hand,
and we just start to pray.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.162
There's really nothing left to say.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.083
I don't wanna die!

22:16.126 --> 22:17.669
I don't wanna die here!

22:17.753 --> 22:19.338
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.722
<i>And that was our reality</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:31.016
It just blew...

22:31.725 --> 22:32.893
all around us...

22:33.685 --> 22:34.936
and kept moving,

22:35.854 --> 22:39.107
and eventually, we were allowed to get up.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.365
The fire front, you know,
passed through, and they got buses up,

22:46.531 --> 22:48.658
and they caravaned
all these people down...

22:48.950 --> 22:50.786
and got 'em... uh, got 'em out of there.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.288
There's room in the van.
Is there anybody else?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.289
All right.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.583
You know, it... it was overwhelming,

22:57.250 --> 22:58.460
but at the same time...

22:59.544 --> 23:01.755
it was just like, "Okay, what's next?"
you know?

23:01.838 --> 23:03.757
You clear that,
you made it through it,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.842
and then, it's like,
"Okay, what's our next move?"

23:08.637 --> 23:10.597
Oh, fuck this. I can't even see.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.814
I went back down,
and I saw some people in a house.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.108
<i>I believe there is one more</i>
<i>person with two dogs,</i>

23:21.191 --> 23:23.151
<i>or two people with one dog,</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

23:23.235 --> 23:25.237
<i>They're being kind of hesitant</i>
<i>to go with us, so we--</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:26.363
-Man!

23:26.446 --> 23:27.906
I'd hit my siren and no one came out.

23:27.989 --> 23:31.201
I was hitting the siren. They'd look out
the window, and I'd get them to come out.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.328
The fire was coming down the road.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.582
There were embers lighting stuff on fire
around their house,

23:37.666 --> 23:40.794
and we were trying to get them out,
and, um... and they were refusing.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.549
We got them,
we shoved them in the vehicle,

23:45.632 --> 23:50.637
and, uh, one of their dogs jumped out
and ran back to the house,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.097
and they wanted to go back.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.307
And I told them, "If you leave,
you're gonna die here.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.310
That fire that's coming is going to...
It will kill you."

23:57.394 --> 23:58.353
Get my phone!

23:58.437 --> 24:02.190
So they were screaming at me,
and we're in... we're in a bad situation.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.484
- Where are we going?
- Just stop.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.278
Please let me do this.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.780
I knew I wasn't gonna make it
through the fire front,

24:08.864 --> 24:12.117
so I picked out a house
that I thought I could survive in,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.660
and then that house caught on fire,

24:14.035 --> 24:15.078
and it went quick.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.081
Hey, I've got him!

24:18.165 --> 24:19.291
<i>Track your fire.</i>

24:19.374 --> 24:22.252
He was on this side of the road.
We're getting the fuck out of here.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.296
I just said, "I'm gonna do it."

24:39.519 --> 24:42.189
I almost threw up.
I mean, I was nauseous from it.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.817
Sit tight, bro. Oh, shit. Hold on.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.695
Hold on, brother.
We're gonna get you out of here.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.365
<i>I had three close calls</i>
<i>in that 24-hour period,</i>

24:52.741 --> 24:55.035
<i>and I think I just kind of reached</i>
<i>a breaking point.</i>

24:55.118 --> 24:57.537
<i>I was like, "There's no way</i>
<i>I'm gonna get away with this."</i>

24:58.246 --> 24:59.498
<i>I couldn't do it anymore.</i>

25:04.377 --> 25:06.796
I didn't want to quit, uh, but...

25:08.048 --> 25:11.551
You know, there's just... I've got...
I've got a wife and two kids and...

25:11.635 --> 25:12.511
um...

25:12.594 --> 25:14.346
I... I needed to make it home, so...

25:14.888 --> 25:17.057
I turned around and went back up,
and, uh...

25:19.392 --> 25:22.395
I'll always remember that,
but, um, I made it, so...

25:23.939 --> 25:25.023
So, anyway...

25:28.026 --> 25:28.902
Shitty.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.237
It was just a shitty day.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.991
But those people are alive.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.245
They probably don't like me very much,
but they're alive,

25:38.328 --> 25:41.081
so at least they're alive
to not like me, right?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.833
Um... so...

26:06.064 --> 26:09.401
<i>California's deadliest wildfire</i>
<i>is now completely contained.</i>

26:09.484 --> 26:13.655
<i>The so-called Camp Fire has burned</i>
<i>240 square miles of Northern California</i>

26:13.738 --> 26:15.949
<i>since it broke out nearly three weeks ago.</i>

26:19.703 --> 26:23.331
<i>Authorities releasing a staggering</i>
<i>and sobering number last night.</i>

26:23.415 --> 26:25.834
<i>The death toll</i>
<i>from Northern California's Camp Fire</i>

26:25.917 --> 26:27.627
<i>has climbed to 77 people.</i>

26:27.711 --> 26:30.380
<i>Over a thousand people</i>
<i>are unaccounted for. Think about that.</i>

26:30.463 --> 26:33.174
<i>Over a thousand people unaccounted for</i>
<i>in Northern California,</i>

26:33.258 --> 26:37.178
<i>after a fast-moving wildfire</i>
<i>demolished the small town of Paradise.</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:42.434
Now...

26:43.435 --> 26:45.604
this is the poor guy,
came down to...

26:45.687 --> 26:47.772
to get my crippled friend out,

26:48.398 --> 26:50.567
and he didn't make it.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.154
Nobody made it down here.
These people all got burned down.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.948
I... I was right down below them here,

26:57.032 --> 27:00.201
and my friend, you can see he's dead,

27:00.660 --> 27:01.661
and his mother.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.790
I'm sorry, buddy.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.801
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.681
Um, many of you spent
your Thanksgiving here yesterday,

27:22.098 --> 27:24.100
up on a hill in the rain and the snow,

27:24.434 --> 27:27.062
and you may be asking yourself,
"What is my mission?"

27:27.729 --> 27:29.105
Your task today

27:29.481 --> 27:32.651
is to help bring closure to a family

27:32.901 --> 27:34.903
um, and get this community
on the road back,

27:34.986 --> 27:37.614
and that... that's kind of...
moves into your purpose.

27:38.406 --> 27:42.077
Your end state
is to help a family move on

27:42.410 --> 27:43.912
and hopefully answer that question

27:43.995 --> 27:46.873
of where, uh, their family members
who are missing are.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.209
So, today, you're gonna be
somebody's hero.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.170
You may never see them.
You may never meet them.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.798
They may not know who you are,
but you'll be someone's hero today.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.851
<i>This was the largest</i>
<i>search-and-rescue operation</i>

28:06.935 --> 28:08.520
<i>ever conducted in California.</i>

28:10.897 --> 28:12.774
<i>Ultimately, a firefighter touched</i>

28:12.857 --> 28:15.652
<i>every one of those 18,000 buildings</i>
<i>that burned down.</i>

28:19.948 --> 28:23.201
<i>It was almost complete destruction</i>
<i>of the community.</i>

28:23.952 --> 28:24.786
<i>Flattened it.</i>

28:26.079 --> 28:29.165
<i>9,700 homes have been destroyed.</i>

28:29.499 --> 28:33.878
<i>Total number of structures wiped out,</i>
<i>12,263.</i>

28:34.629 --> 28:36.881
<i>The death toll climbing ever higher,</i>

28:36.965 --> 28:40.301
<i>the big question is,</i>
<i>how many more victims will be found?</i>

28:41.219 --> 28:43.138
Now, what do you suspect
those are?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.306
Possibly bone fragments.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.441
Let's see if we can find where they are.

28:56.317 --> 29:00.739
<i>I-I kept coming home, you know,</i>
<i>after the Valley Fire in 2015, and...</i>

29:01.322 --> 29:03.867
<i>my wife, I told her,</i>
<i>this was unprecedented.</i>

29:04.784 --> 29:06.995
After the North Bay fires
in Sonoma and Napa,

29:07.078 --> 29:09.914
I told her
this was unprecedented fire behavior.

29:10.582 --> 29:14.252
The Thomas Fire
in, uh, Ventura and Santa Barbara,

29:14.335 --> 29:16.212
I told her, "This is unprecedented."

29:16.296 --> 29:18.798
And finally, she told me,
"I think you have to stop saying that."

29:19.966 --> 29:23.428
And for someone who's not a firefighter,
from the outside looking in, to say that,

29:23.511 --> 29:25.847
you know, it was
kind of a wake-up call for me.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.391
It most certainly, um...

29:28.725 --> 29:30.226
is not normal,

29:30.310 --> 29:31.978
and... and I don't... I want it to...

29:32.061 --> 29:33.813
I want it to stop being normal.

29:43.281 --> 29:47.702
<i>We have had a series of incidents</i>
<i>in the last ten years</i>

29:47.786 --> 29:49.996
<i>that have eclipsed anything that we've had</i>

29:50.079 --> 29:52.373
<i>in the history</i>
<i>of firefighting in California.</i>

30:02.717 --> 30:03.802
<i>Mass destruction,</i>

30:04.803 --> 30:06.638
<i>extremely rapid fire spread,</i>

30:07.597 --> 30:09.349
<i>resistant to control,</i>

30:09.432 --> 30:11.935
<i>none of our tools able to fight the fire,</i>

30:12.018 --> 30:13.228
<i>having to move guys out,</i>

30:13.311 --> 30:17.440
<i>having firefighters getting trapped</i>
<i>and injured and killed.</i>

30:19.567 --> 30:21.778
This is freaking crazy.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.033
Everyone wants to focus
on the fuel portion of it.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.451
That's just one component.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.746
The-- The part that's affecting us
the most is our weather.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.292
And that's what's driving these fires.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.419
We're setting records every year.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.004
Our humidities are lower,

30:40.505 --> 30:43.925
the fire's burning as aggressively
at night as it is during the day,

30:44.008 --> 30:46.803
and so we don't ever get that chance
to get ahead of it,

30:47.303 --> 30:51.558
and the toll on our people is extreme.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.311
For us,

30:56.729 --> 30:57.981
we're living it.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.775
I mean, I... I'm living it
half of the year.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.151
Um...

31:03.403 --> 31:04.863
Being at war.

31:21.629 --> 31:22.505
This is it.

31:23.631 --> 31:26.551
This is where me and my wife, we...

31:28.136 --> 31:33.182
saved up, and we sold our house in Magalia
to buy this really nice house, and...

31:34.392 --> 31:35.518
we felt like an adult.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.773
Walked down there,
and it was just the chimney standing.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.407
I wish I would have grabbed

31:50.241 --> 31:51.367
my photo albums...

31:52.619 --> 31:53.953
of my family, my grandpa.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.999
I wish I would have grabbed my cats.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.461
They meant a really...
They meant a lot to my wife.

32:01.836 --> 32:02.879
But you don't have time.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.674
There's no way to prepare...

32:07.091 --> 32:08.343
for something like this.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.553
I mean, it was just such a...

32:11.054 --> 32:12.805
a fast-moving disaster.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.934
It's a grieving process.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.352
It feels like a death...

32:18.061 --> 32:19.479
of the life that we had.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.651
<i>I want to see people</i>
<i>back in their houses again.</i>

32:25.985 --> 32:28.071
<i>I want to watch the... the walls come up.</i>

32:29.822 --> 32:31.658
But Paradise...

32:33.785 --> 32:34.786
it's not the same.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.670
Some days, we feel different.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.839
How many of you feel different
on different days?

32:48.383 --> 32:51.803
Have you woken up
and just felt, like, so mad?

32:52.095 --> 32:54.514
Raise your hand
if you have just felt so mad.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.224
Hands down.

32:56.307 --> 33:00.019
Have you woken up and just felt super sad?

33:00.520 --> 33:01.354
Yeah.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.483
<i>We never thought we would be</i>
<i>on the bus for almost six hours.</i>

33:05.566 --> 33:06.609
I know. Yes.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.820
Six hours is a long time.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.241
And we had some, you know, some...

33:13.324 --> 33:14.867
some animated kids, but...

33:16.577 --> 33:17.912
they were very brave.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.082
I'm very proud of...
I'm very proud of those kids on that bus.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.626
Today, in your journal,

33:24.711 --> 33:26.212
we're gonna ask that you write

33:26.796 --> 33:28.631
how your heart is feeling today.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.884
It's really important to write that down.

33:35.847 --> 33:36.889
I want you to write.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.559
Get your writing done,
then I'll talk to you after.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.403
I have mixed emotions about, uh...

33:51.404 --> 33:54.657
living up there with so few homes,

33:54.741 --> 33:57.827
so few people around me.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.079
I'm scared, definitely, to go back.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.601
Oh, my gosh.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.315
I feel like it's a dream.

34:39.659 --> 34:40.495
Wow.

34:47.376 --> 34:52.422
<i>We had a great responsibility</i>
<i>to be hopeful for those kids.</i>

34:53.882 --> 34:55.176
As a mother...

34:56.552 --> 34:57.386
uh...

34:57.762 --> 34:59.555
you know, just knowing...

35:01.599 --> 35:05.103
I had an important role on that bus.
Abbie and I had important roles.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.313
These kids didn't have their mom and dads.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.528
Yeah, it's a great little school.

35:15.905 --> 35:16.739
Wow.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.325
We got lucky.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.928
That's the Honey Run
Covered Bridge, huh?

35:39.846 --> 35:42.056
<i>It was such a beautiful community.</i>

35:45.601 --> 35:47.979
My littlest,
the other day, commented,

35:48.062 --> 35:49.647
"Mommy, I just want to go home.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.732
I just want to go home."

35:52.859 --> 35:54.569
And I said, "I get it, kiddo.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.072
I'm right there with you.
All these people just want to go home."

36:00.867 --> 36:01.701
But...

36:02.743 --> 36:05.955
I don't want to see that road that...
that we drove out on.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.459
I think just the visions of it
looking like Armageddon.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.797
Chico's now our home.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.216
All these people are now our home.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.218
And, um...

36:20.428 --> 36:22.013
Yeah, we got through it.

36:27.768 --> 36:31.105
There's Paradise residents
displaced all over the county now.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.196
You can't just take, you know,
30,000, 40,000 people,

36:38.613 --> 36:40.615
throw them into the next city over

36:40.698 --> 36:42.658
and expect there to be
enough housing for everyone.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.914
Some people lost their jobs
and their homes,

36:48.331 --> 36:50.416
you know, all in one fell swoop,
in one day.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.459
Gone. Everything.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.047
You know,
that's pretty hard to recover from.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.090
Uh, that's a challenge.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.718
So, my heart goes out to everybody.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.142
<i>I haven't been back up to Paradise.</i>

37:10.269 --> 37:12.230
I mean, 89 people...

37:13.272 --> 37:14.482
Eighty-nine people died.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.275
Eighty-eight?

37:17.193 --> 37:18.986
So many people.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.657
<i>Everywhere you go, there's someone.</i>

37:24.909 --> 37:26.494
<i>They experienced it themselves,</i>

37:26.953 --> 37:28.537
<i>or they have family or friends.</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:33.751
And we're just kind of all in it together,
but I feel we're also, like, just all...

37:34.126 --> 37:35.586
zombies walking.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.174
And just shuffling around,
trying to figure out,

37:40.258 --> 37:42.969
"What do we do next? What do we do next?
Where do we go next?"

37:43.636 --> 37:45.304
Because it's such a small town

37:45.388 --> 37:49.558
in the grand scheme
of the county and the state, and...

37:50.643 --> 37:52.561
there will be more catastrophic events

37:52.645 --> 37:55.731
and more, you know, things
that are gonna come and cover over it,

37:55.815 --> 37:57.400
and people are gonna forget,

37:57.733 --> 37:58.985
and I don't want them to forget,

37:59.068 --> 38:01.737
because there's so many people
who still need help.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.783
And there's so much stuff
that still needs to be done,

38:05.866 --> 38:06.909
and, um...

38:11.998 --> 38:14.166
I just don't want people
to forget about us.
