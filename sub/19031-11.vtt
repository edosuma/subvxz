WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.462
Our study group was
a well-oiled machine.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.733
Drew was in charge
and I was second in command,

00:05.772 --> 00:07.399
responsible for two things.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.433
Class notes.
Yep, I got the notes right here.

00:11.478 --> 00:15.175
And keeping Cole occupied
while we did the real work.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.513
Babe, these wheelie shoes are sick.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.450
Okay, I'll just be walking
next to someone,

00:19.486 --> 00:21.613
then I'll start rolling,
and they're like, "What?"

00:21.654 --> 00:24.953
And I'm like, "Later, Tevas."
God. Where should I go next?

00:27.894 --> 00:32.627
What in the heck do you have on
the bottom of those sneakers, champ?

00:32.665 --> 00:35.293
Are... Are those wheels?

00:36.903 --> 00:39.428
Would you show me your glide?
Go ahead, roll them on out.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.962
Get your glide on.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.702
Dr. Cox was scary
when he was in his regular mood,

00:44.744 --> 00:48.305
but him in a good mood
was utterly terrifying.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.308
Well, are you all dying to know
why I'm in such a festive mood?

00:51.351 --> 00:53.319
'Cause you're about to do
something horrible to us?

00:55.321 --> 00:58.688
Drew, you and your worthless
classmates have just won

00:58.725 --> 01:03.185
an all-expenses-paid trip to Hell Week.

01:03.229 --> 01:07.666
Six days and seven nights of tests,
term papers and group projects.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.500
By the end of the week, one of you
is going to have a psychotic break.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.439
How darn good is it to be me
right about now?

01:14.474 --> 01:18.274
Just this side of fabulous is the answer.
Just this side of fabulous.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.642
As much as Dr. Cox loved torturing us,

01:21.681 --> 01:24.980
Dr. Turk enjoyed all the perks
of being Chief of Surgery.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.181
Whoo!

01:30.223 --> 01:31.884
What a day.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.260
T-Dog! Looking-good five!

01:37.297 --> 01:39.231
Mmm! Mmm! Ha, ha!

01:40.633 --> 01:42.726
Where's my pastry?

01:43.670 --> 01:46.434
- Too sugary.
- Hey. Nothing's too sugary, woman.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.168
Tell that to your diabetes.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.938
So, you worked hard all these years
to become Chief of Surgery

01:50.977 --> 01:54.242
- just so people would kiss your ass.
- No. I get a parking spot, too.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.271
Plus, I get to nickname people
whatever I want.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.548
Hey, what's up, Mac-and-Cheese?
Aw, snap. Ham-and-Cheese.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.782
Oh, Rain-maker in the house!
What's happening?

02:03.056 --> 02:04.318
Oh, hi.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.856
- What was that?
- Oh, we're taking a break.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.418
Since when? What?

02:09.461 --> 02:10.860
Well, we said "I love you"
to each other,

02:10.896 --> 02:14.060
and it's horrible and gross
and I hate myself and him.

02:15.034 --> 02:19.130
Every week is already Hell Week.
How could it get any worse?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.997
Hey, did you have Hell Week
at your med school?

02:22.041 --> 02:24.908
Yeah. It stressed me out so much
my throat seized up for, like, a year.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.070
God. How bad was it?

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.659 --> 02:43.789
Not going to lie.
It left a few psychological marks.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.288
One of you is probably going to crack.
I'm looking at you, Jet Li.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.700
But, hey, good luck. Rooting for you.

02:50.737 --> 02:54.867
All right, Drew. You're our leader.
Let's get this going.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.399
Get what going?
I rarely listen to you people.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.274
Seriously, Big D, if I fail out of here,

02:59.312 --> 03:01.542
I gotta go to med school
in the Caribbean.

03:01.581 --> 03:04.209
Dude, I don't speak Carribesian!
So, tell us what to do.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.413
All right, why does this always have to
fall on me? I don't have the plan.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.216
I don't have the answer
to every damn question.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.356
Hey, Drew's right. Everybody,
back up, give him some space.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.992
He'll figure out the plan
and then text us.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.634
Oh, hell, no.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.574
Yo! Somebody's parked in my spot.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.911
Boo-hoo. It takes me 11 minutes to pee.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.679
Do you guys know
who DOC XTREME is?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.049
Russell Vaughn.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.054
Surgeon, best-selling author,
wrote some book

03:42.088 --> 03:45.421
about doctoring in the Third World
called Rebel Without a Co-Pay.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.686
"'What am I supposed to do? '

03:46.726 --> 03:51.356
"'Take the bullet out of his mistress's
jaw or take a bullet of your own."'

03:51.397 --> 03:53.865
I did the surgery
and he shot me anyway.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.792
By the way,
that mistress is now my wife.

03:57.937 --> 04:01.338
Yes, he is a bit of a douche,
but every time he shows up here

04:01.374 --> 04:03.638
he raises millions for the hospital.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.203
And he has nailed some
top-shelf international strange.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.872
- How...
- Greetings.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.348
Hi. Dr. Russell Vaughn.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.181
Yeah, I'm Dr. Christopher
Duncan Turk, Chief of Surgery.

04:13.219 --> 04:16.779
- Listen, man, you parked in my spot.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.314
You know, I have to remind myself
that I'm back in the States,

04:19.358 --> 04:22.294
- where status is everything.
- It's not everything.

04:22.328 --> 04:26.526
It's just that my spot's in the shade,
and I have leather seats,

04:26.566 --> 04:29.729
and my seats get warm
when the sun hits them.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.827
I also just recently...

04:31.938 --> 04:34.873
You're going to
want to stop talking now.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.010
Hey.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.810
I just needed a moment
of peace and quiet.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.875
The other students will not stop
asking me questions.

04:45.918 --> 04:51.379
Oh, please, I have a hospital full
of incompetents hammering me

04:51.424 --> 04:55.121
with asinine questions
every second of every day.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.422
Doctor Cox,
your patient in three is septic.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.159
Antibiotics or vasopressors?

05:00.199 --> 05:01.325
Antibiotics first.

05:02.835 --> 05:03.859
That wasn't so dumb.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.062
Wait for it.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.164
Oh. Did you get my request for scrubs

05:08.207 --> 05:10.937
that hug a little closer
to my wham-bam?

05:11.511 --> 05:14.139
Thank you, Todd,
for being the example to a point

05:14.180 --> 05:16.774
- that you don't understand.
- You're welcome.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.844
I didn't ask to be put in charge.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.980
I know, Number One,
but that's who we are.

05:23.022 --> 05:27.516
We have been blessed and cursed
with intelligence and wonderful hair.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.027
And people follow.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.394
You're just going to have to deal
with that the rest of your life.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.523
No. I'm done babysitting.

05:32.565 --> 05:37.229
I don't want to be a leader.
I just want to be a good doctor.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.760
Fair enough.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.468
Um...

05:42.508 --> 05:44.339
Is there something
I can help you with, Russell?

05:44.377 --> 05:46.072
Actually, I'm helping you.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.979
Dr. Cox told me to jump onto any cases
that interested me.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.143
I've got everything under control
in this room.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.211
Why don't you go
and Russell up your own case?

05:57.590 --> 06:00.286
Clever. I was just telling Irene here
that it looks as though

06:00.326 --> 06:02.590
she's going to need
a septal myomectomy.

06:02.628 --> 06:06.325
Russell, I'll decide which treatment
is best for my patients.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.402
We'll probably go with what he said.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.832
Eleven minutes to answer a page?
Really embarrassing.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.242
It's 4:00 in the morning.

06:19.278 --> 06:23.044
Hey, Bed-Head, what are those?
Horses on your pajamas?

06:23.082 --> 06:26.711
Well, I didn't do my laundry.
I have nothing else to wear.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.221
Except more horse pajamas.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.152
Here are the case histories
for your group projects.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.920
You will test, diagnose

06:33.960 --> 06:37.623
and come up with treatments
for each of your fake patients.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.928
You will then present your findings
in three days.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.959
Number One, you don't have to work
with these stooges anymore.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.437
I have a very special project for you.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.033
Where's the rich jackass?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.107
I love Hell Week.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.526
So, what's my project?

07:16.569 --> 07:22.030
Your project is to avoid them.
They are vampires.

07:22.074 --> 07:25.635
Time-sucking monsters who will
torture you with stupid questions,

07:25.678 --> 07:29.409
mind-numbing incompetence
and petty emotional problems.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.009
"I'm so stressed
I feel like I want to kill myself."

07:32.051 --> 07:34.178
Well, what are you waiting for? Do it.

07:34.220 --> 07:38.316
Okay. Great.
So, what exactly is my project?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.054
I want you to focus on yourself,
on your abilities,

07:43.095 --> 07:47.031
on becoming the amazing doctor
I know you can be.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.192
Thank you so much.

07:48.234 --> 07:52.170
Again, really unclear
about what my project is.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.571
You're just going to shadow me
and stay the hell away from them.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.575
- Listen to me, son...
- Hey, Drew.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.608
Go. Save yourself.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.170
- What?
- Run!

08:02.215 --> 08:04.775
Hello, Blondie,
is there anything I can do for you?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.547
Uh, I was just going to ask Drew

08:07.587 --> 08:09.555
who he thought the next leader
of our group should be.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.749
You. You're the one.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.558
Yeah. You think so?

08:14.594 --> 08:17.392
No, I just said that
because you're the first one I saw.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.690
Jambo, Doctors. Jambo.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.725
That's Swahili for
"Hello" or "Good morning."

08:23.769 --> 08:26.067
Oh, is it, really?
'Cause I know what it means.

08:26.105 --> 08:30.667
I had Jambo Juice this morning.
A Berry Blast with an Echinacea Boost.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.769
It was delicious.
I'm going to live forever.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.679
You'll be dead.
I'll be alive, though. I'll be alive.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.410
Wow. Sure you didn't get
a Femboost in there?

08:38.451 --> 08:39.611
That was pretty catty.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.177
It's just that Russell ticks me off,
you know?

08:42.221 --> 08:45.713
He comes in here
with his book and his rope bracelets

08:45.758 --> 08:48.192
and his wanting to
help me with surgeries.

08:48.227 --> 08:52.391
- I don't need anybody's help.
- Yeah. This isn't about surgery.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.923
This is about all the attention
Russell's getting. You're jealous.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.625
If I'm going to be jealous of someone,

08:57.670 --> 09:02.039
it's going to be a dude who could
breathe underwater or Serena Williams.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.975
That ass is righteous.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.503
I'm just saying.
Kind of acting like a 13-year-old girl.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.106
- Oh, my God, there's Drew.
- Yeah.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.514
- Did he see me?
- Yes.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.143
- Is he coming over here?
- Yes, he is.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.584
- Crap.
- Hey, Drew.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.417
Hey. Oh!

09:16.856 --> 09:23.386
- Hey, there, you.
- Afternoon, good sir.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.522
Your face is looking quite normal.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.655
Oh...

09:33.906 --> 09:35.203
- All right.
- Okay...

09:35.241 --> 09:36.367
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:40.713 --> 09:44.046
So, I thought we could start
with a little bonding game.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.517
Two Truths and a Lie. I'll start.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.316
I am from a small fishing town
in Maryland,

09:50.356 --> 09:52.756
horses are my favorite animal

09:52.792 --> 09:58.162
and I once made love with
tennis great Pete Sampras.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.759
Pistol Pete? Damn, that's hot.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.598
No, see, Cole, that was the lie.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.127
My mom hooked up
with Michael Chang.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.003
All right, look,
let's just forget about the game.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.600
Okay, my mom used to date
Craig T. Nelson.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.702
Coach was almost my dad!

10:12.945 --> 10:16.938
Lucy, this is a waste of time.
I'm taking over the group.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.617
Oh, damn! A coup de Trang!

10:20.653 --> 10:24.316
All right, Lucy. Keep it together.
Don't get crazy.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.683
Lucy, what do you want?

10:27.727 --> 10:29.490
If Cox sees me with you,
he's going to kill me.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.359
Please, I need your help.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.661
I was leading our group
and they weren't listening

10:33.699 --> 10:35.462
and I felt it happening again.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.070
See, whenever I get into
a position of power,

10:38.104 --> 10:40.095
something changes inside me.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.933
Look, the key to leading the group
is Trang.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.809
You gotta get in that little bastard's
face and you gotta let the crazy out.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.211
Do you want to see how I do it?

10:48.247 --> 10:51.774
You back the hell up right now
or I will watch you die and I will laugh!

10:51.817 --> 10:52.875
Ha, ha, ha!

10:52.918 --> 10:54.783
See, it's easy.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.921
There's Drew. What an ass.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.156
Why don't you let me fix this?
All right, I'm going to fix this.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.859
Hey, Drew, come. Come on. It's cool.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.435
- Hey, there, again.
- Hey, how's it going.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.996
You guys. Come on. You're in love.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.908
You need to start talking.
Let's get it going.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.207
Sorry to interrupt.

11:20.246 --> 11:23.044
Now, I understand Dr. Turk's
naive impulse to get it going.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.516
He was raised on a diet of
Western television and airport novels.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.076
But in many less developed parts
of the world,

11:28.120 --> 11:31.351
silence plays a crucial part
of a couple's search

11:31.390 --> 11:33.654
for real, true emotional intimacy.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.786
I'm reminded of an old proverb

11:35.828 --> 11:38.922
from the
Zambezi River Tribe,

11:38.964 --> 11:42.092
"Two hearts forged in silence
grow into one."

11:42.968 --> 11:44.060
Mmm.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.562
- Your last tot beckons me.
- Oh.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.335
- May I?
- Dude. You...

11:49.375 --> 11:52.037
You can't just take my last tot like that.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.006
What the... Oh, I get it.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.072
Dude starts speaking...

11:58.184 --> 12:00.084
And all of a sudden,
everything's all good, huh?

12:00.119 --> 12:02.314
It's all good now?

12:02.354 --> 12:05.517
Fine. I'm going to go get
some more tots.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.690
Lucy, have a seat. We're about to start.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.297
- What are you doing?
- Staring into your soul.

12:14.333 --> 12:19.327
Dominating your mind.
I'm freaking your bean. See?

12:19.371 --> 12:22.033
I own that. That's my vacation home.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.840
I come up on the weekends
when I feel like bringing the hurt.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.439
All right, people,
let's start on Chapter 10.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.679
Uh-oh!

12:34.720 --> 12:36.085
It's happening.

12:37.790 --> 12:42.056
- All right. We should really go.
- Ignore the pagers. I'm in charge.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.832
Hey, you're right. You're absolutely
right. Everything's fine.

12:52.404 --> 12:53.962
Yes!

12:54.673 --> 12:59.474
- What the hell happened to you guys?
- Dude, it was awesome.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.675
Lucy beat the crap out of Trang.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.344
Best girl fight I've seen since
I paid those two lady janitors to wrestle.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.778
What is that? You all hear that?

13:10.856 --> 13:12.346
Whoo!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.151
Dip! Russell is breaking it down.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.190
Ha!

13:21.000 --> 13:25.664
That was a real Maasai warrior dance.
You got moves like that?

13:26.438 --> 13:28.133
That's not fair, now.
I mean, everybody, of course,

13:28.174 --> 13:32.668
they hear the music,
but not everybody hears the music.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.975
Are you... Yo.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.142
- Beatbox.
- What?

13:38.184 --> 13:42.018
- Beatbox, son!
- I guess I can try.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.758
Old school!

13:56.335 --> 14:01.466
No, keep it going! Keep it going!
One leg. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.666
No, no, I got this. I got this.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.143
No, don't pull me...
I pulled it. I pulled it. I pulled it.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.668
- I pulled it...
- What the hell was that?

14:09.515 --> 14:13.246
What are you talking about?
A specific move or the entire program?

14:13.285 --> 14:16.812
- Do you respect yourself right now?
- Oh, God, no.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.314
- Russell. Who's named Russell?
- A ton of people.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.885
- But it's such a girly name, right?
- No, not really.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.755
Would it hurt you to build up a brother?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.061
You know what, I don't need you.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.125
I'm done with this dude bothering me.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.530
Oh!

14:31.570 --> 14:34.698
Hell can mean different things
for different people.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.771
Whether it's being bested by a rival...

14:38.244 --> 14:41.077
How we feeling today, Irene?

14:41.113 --> 14:45.516
Did Dr. Vaughn tell you?
I think I want him to do the surgery.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.354
- Oh, I didn't get a chance to tell him yet.
- Russell.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.083
...or being let down by a friend.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.524
I tried what you said with Trang
and it didn't work.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.894
Look, after months of self-doubt,
I have finally found my role here.

14:58.931 --> 15:03.095
I am a great Number Two.
I'm Garfunkel, Drew.

15:03.602 --> 15:07.834
And I am okay with that,
but I need you to be my Micky Dolenz.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.802
- That was the band, right?
- Yeah. Dolenz and Garfunkel.

15:13.445 --> 15:17.381
Couldn't you just come back? Please.
We need you. I need you.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.283
Lucy, I'm sorry, I just don't care.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.346
You need to put on your big-girl pants,
suck it up and figure it out for yourself.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.257
So, Drew had abandoned us,
and that was fine,

15:36.302 --> 15:38.532
because I was finding my feet
as a leader.

15:38.570 --> 15:43.598
I was inspiring the group like my hero,
the lesbian president from 24.

15:43.642 --> 15:48.545
Everybody get out! I'll do it
myself. You're all useless.

15:50.482 --> 15:54.179
What? You don't need to worry
about us, buddy boy.

15:54.219 --> 15:58.212
It's my house now,
and it is all good in the hood, bro.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.153
Uh...

16:04.196 --> 16:05.458
Russell?

16:05.497 --> 16:07.192
Why are you putting my name
in the "Assist" column?

16:07.232 --> 16:09.792
Yes, yes, I picked you to help me
with Irene's surgery.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.962
You know, I thought it'd be
a real nice feather in your cap.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.871
- Way to go, man.
- Oh! Way to go.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.775
Russell, listen, I don't need
any more feathers in my cap, okay?

16:18.811 --> 16:23.578
I've got a peacock back here.
Major plumage!

16:23.615 --> 16:25.640
I have so much that I could teach you,

16:25.684 --> 16:29.552
I mean, if you just open up your eyes
and let me in, Turk. Let me in.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.515
I'm about to punch you in your mouth.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.151
Fine, but be fair warned.
I trained with the Mossad, okay?

16:34.193 --> 16:35.922
I could kill you
with a button off your jacket.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.452
Really? Well, I train with LaMarcus
down at the gym.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.625
And he was an NFL linebacker
until he came out the closet.

16:51.043 --> 16:55.275
All right, I have two minutes.
Here's what you should be doing.

16:55.314 --> 16:58.647
Thank God you're back, Drew.
Lucy is crazy.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.745
Trang, you haven't even begun to
see crazy. You want to do this again?

17:02.788 --> 17:05.415
You feeling froggy? Then leap, son.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.915
Stop! All right, I'm not even supposed
to be helping you, so listen up.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.157
The key to diagnosing your case study
is in Chapter...

17:12.196 --> 17:15.462
Drew. Outside. Now.

17:17.603 --> 17:22.301
- Wait, Drew, what chapter?
- What book? They all have chapters!

17:22.708 --> 17:26.838
You. Now, just exactly what in the hell
were you doing in there? Come on.

17:27.512 --> 17:30.004
Now, I gave you the keys to freedom,
and you blew it.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.148
Now, I'm going to stand here and watch
as you march back into that hole

17:34.186 --> 17:37.781
and tell those parasites
that they have to do it on their own.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.592
You know what? I can't do that
because I'm one of those parasites.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.254
In fact, I'm the king of the parasites.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.320
And whether you like it or not,
they need me.

17:45.364 --> 17:49.892
So, fail me if you want,
but I'm going to go back in there,

17:49.935 --> 17:51.459
and I'm going to help my friends.

17:51.503 --> 17:55.837
Of course
that is what you're going to do.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.934
You're like me, Number One.
You can't help yourself.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.536
Son, you're a leader.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.377
You had this whole thing planned,
didn't you?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.384
You knew I wouldn't be able to
stay away from them.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.147
Yes, indeed.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.052
A piece of advice,

18:10.656 --> 18:13.625
pick a leadership style and stick to it,

18:13.659 --> 18:18.392
but please avoid "aggressive shaming,"
because that's my bread and butter.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.558
Yeah. I've seen your work.
Very impressive.

18:23.368 --> 18:26.269
Thank you, that means a lot to me.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.236
Get... Go, go, go. Go. Go.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.209
This is embarrassing.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.980
Why you moping around
like a tiny girl bitch?

18:43.088 --> 18:48.048
Wow. Can't you ever just be like, "Hi,"
or, even better, "What's up?"

18:48.694 --> 18:50.059
Sure.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.325
What's up, tiny girl bitch?

18:52.364 --> 18:54.628
So, you're too good
to assist Russell now?

18:54.666 --> 18:56.327
No, I am the Chief of Surgery.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.394
- I'm no one's secretary.
- Secretary?

18:59.438 --> 19:02.202
He's asking you to help him
with a tricky surgery.

19:02.741 --> 19:06.609
Sir, do you just hang around waiting
for conversations to weigh in on?

19:06.645 --> 19:10.706
Yeah. That and my judge shows
get me through the day.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.617
Now, look, good leaders don't care
about their ego.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.644
If all you want to do is get massaged,

19:16.688 --> 19:20.920
I've got the number of a girl
who will take you to the mountaintop.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.829
- God, you are a nasty, old man.
- Thanks, dear.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.357
Turkleton, let me cut to the quick.

19:27.399 --> 19:31.563
Either you get into that surgery, pucker
up and start kissing Russell's ass

19:31.603 --> 19:35.972
so he continues to raise
giant sums of money for this hospital,

19:36.008 --> 19:39.239
which helps everyone,
or you can continue to act like a...

19:39.278 --> 19:41.269
- What was that, dear?
- Tiny girl bitch.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.907
That's right.
Either way, it's your call, Chief.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.511
Sir, you're so happy you're not the chief
anymore, aren't you?

19:47.953 --> 19:49.477
Every second.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.250
All right, we have five hours
to finish this project.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.695
We'll start with the labs
and move on to diagnosis.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.665
Wait, so what? You think
you can just waltz back in here

20:01.700 --> 20:03.998
after abandoning us
and be the leader of our group again?

20:04.436 --> 20:07.064
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.874
Hey, yo, Drew,
I am glad you are back, man.

20:10.909 --> 20:14.367
But I was thinking, before we start,
we'd take a little break.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.280
Garfunkel, handle that.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.284
Yeah, you know
what would be great, Cole?

20:19.318 --> 20:21.309
Is if you could go get us all
some coffee.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.446
Hey, maybe you could take
your wheelie shoes.

20:23.822 --> 20:27.815
Oh, man, I'd love to,
but some big guys took them.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.789
Oh, well, then, why don't you just
root around for mints in my purse?

20:32.798 --> 20:36.029
Sometimes being a leader
is knowing when to step up.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.968
It is important to mention
and briefly discuss,

20:38.003 --> 20:39.994
the innervation of the pancreas...

20:40.806 --> 20:44.902
And sometimes being a leader
is knowing when to step aside.

20:44.943 --> 20:50.609
Hey, Russell, if you still need
a pair of hands, I'm here.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.911
Good for you, Christopher.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.781
You know, reminds me
of an old anecdote

20:53.819 --> 20:56.379
- from my good friend Bono.
- Could you just cut?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.321
He was just about to
go on stage at Wimbledon.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.154
It was the first album. The crowd...

21:01.326 --> 21:03.726
Now that I guess we love each other,

21:03.762 --> 21:05.889
we should probably share
all our weird secrets.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.297
All right, you go first.

21:08.333 --> 21:12.201
I cry when I watch The Bachelor.
I watch The Bachelor.

21:12.704 --> 21:16.663
- I lost my virginity to a sofa.
- I like when ice skaters fall down.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.103
- Doesn't count, everybody likes that.
- I like when children fall down.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.977
- I love you.
- Fine.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.348
I love you, too.
