00:06.209 --> 00:08.178
(Kim Seol Hyun, Im Si Wan)

00:08.179 --> 00:10.419
(Shin Eun Soo, Park Ye Young, Kwak Min Gyu, Bang Jae Min)

00:34.840 --> 00:39.939
(Summer Strike)

00:45.850 --> 00:48.219
I've been running toward a place for some time.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.289
I'm running as fast as I can.

00:56.729 --> 01:00.770
But ironically, I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

01:02.770 --> 01:04.170
(One Way)

01:05.670 --> 01:07.409
It looks like I'm at school this time.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.609
The closer I get to the classroom,

01:15.909 --> 01:18.980
the clearer my realization becomes.

01:23.219 --> 01:27.359
That the door will remain tightly closed as always.

01:30.530 --> 01:33.730
Sir! I'm here. Please open the door.

01:33.799 --> 01:34.870
Sir!

01:36.370 --> 01:37.769
Open the door!

01:38.500 --> 01:40.099
Sir! Can't you hear me?

01:45.109 --> 01:47.509
- Turn in your answer sheets now. - Open the door!

01:47.510 --> 01:50.079
Open up!

01:50.849 --> 01:52.349
Open the door!

01:55.450 --> 01:56.719
Can't you hear me?

02:27.120 --> 02:31.060
Is this how it feels when men have to enlist again in their dreams?

02:40.870 --> 02:44.439
Please don't run, play, or lean on the handrails.

02:58.419 --> 03:00.520
The train is approaching the platform.

03:00.849 --> 03:02.918
The train for Yeouido...

03:02.919 --> 03:05.819
is approaching the platform.

03:09.030 --> 03:10.830
The screen doors are opening.

03:11.629 --> 03:14.430
The places I arrived in my dreams after running as fast as I could...

03:15.000 --> 03:17.439
turned out to be a school, the office,

03:18.139 --> 03:19.900
or the college entrance exam site.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.610
The destinations might vary,

03:25.439 --> 03:28.310
but my dreams always end the same way.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.189
I always find myself standing...

03:36.490 --> 03:38.259
all alone in front of the closed door.

03:40.289 --> 03:43.759
(Summer Strike, Episode 1)

03:58.680 --> 04:01.409
Hello. I'm Lee Yeo Reum from Planning Team One.

04:02.879 --> 04:05.379
Hello. I'm Lee Yeo Reum from Planning Team One.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.490
"Poems from the hands."

04:08.189 --> 04:10.590
Instead of compiling rationally sounding writings...

04:13.689 --> 04:16.029
(Our emotions are bound to be shown in our handwriting.)

04:22.899 --> 04:24.399
Were you working on your presentation?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.568
Have you been here long enough to do a presentation now?

04:27.569 --> 04:29.370
"Poems from the hands."

04:29.709 --> 04:31.679
Goodness. This concept sounds...

04:31.680 --> 04:33.750
It's a bit outdated, isn't it?

04:33.980 --> 04:35.209
Are you all ready?

04:36.850 --> 04:38.250
This one is important. Okay?

04:40.490 --> 04:42.449
You don't look that bad today.

04:44.420 --> 04:45.620
I'll bring him in then.

04:45.660 --> 04:49.089
Sir, I have something. It might not be that important, though.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.828
What is it? You're making me anxious.

04:50.829 --> 04:53.929
From what I hear, our new CEO is quite picky...

04:53.930 --> 04:56.069
that he only drinks a specific kind of coffee.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.170
So I'm not sure if we should serve him canned coffee.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.269
- Really? - Yes.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.338
He only drinks fancy coffee like Geisha coffee or something.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.709
All right. Hold on.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.180
- What was that? - Geisha.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.389
Yeo Reum.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.259
You didn't know about that?

05:17.519 --> 05:19.459
- I'm sorry. - Listen.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.360
Finding out about your boss' preferences is the most basic task.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.628
Should I go and buy some coffee now?

05:25.629 --> 05:28.199
Make it fast. He'll be here only briefly.

05:29.899 --> 05:30.970
Are you walking right now?

05:58.860 --> 06:00.259
Geisha coffee, please.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.569
"Poems from the hands."

06:35.829 --> 06:38.769
Let me give you an overview of our concept.

06:39.439 --> 06:42.209
As you can see here, every poem...

06:42.370 --> 06:44.208
is bound to embrace the poet's unique style,

06:44.209 --> 06:46.040
the atmosphere...

06:46.209 --> 06:49.449
when the poem was composed, and the poet's feelings.

06:49.879 --> 06:52.879
As for this poet, Shin Dal Ja, you can see...

06:55.089 --> 06:56.948
that the poet was thoroughly immersed...

06:56.949 --> 07:00.829
in the atmosphere when writing this and was thinking about his lover.

07:00.930 --> 07:03.359
Just like this poem, a handwritten poem...

07:03.360 --> 07:06.128
captures the sincere moment you can't possibly get...

07:06.129 --> 07:07.600
from printed...

07:08.800 --> 07:10.639
Gosh. That was nice.

07:10.769 --> 07:13.909
Your book pitches were always about how to make...

07:13.910 --> 07:15.869
good investments and so on.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.979
But this time, you guys focused on nostalgia with old-fashioned ways.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.550
And now of all times.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.350
I really liked it. I was impressed.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.679
Thank you.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.550
We still have a long way ahead of us to catch up with you.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.119
Right. Why don't we do...

07:29.120 --> 07:31.259
the handwritten poem project with every writer? Like a series.

07:32.189 --> 07:33.459
Thank you.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.829
- We'll do our best. - Thank you.

07:35.459 --> 07:37.128
Why don't we all grab lunch together?

07:37.129 --> 07:39.060
- Yes, sir. We should go. - Okay?

07:42.970 --> 07:45.399
You killed that presentation. I thought you prepared it.

07:46.339 --> 07:47.540
Sir.

07:49.410 --> 07:52.409
He came in as soon as you left.

07:52.410 --> 07:53.979
We were so flustered earlier.

07:53.980 --> 07:57.620
Right. When you were out there trying to get coffee.

07:57.879 --> 08:00.850
Ms. Kim here managed to give the presentation.

08:01.449 --> 08:02.790
Good work.

08:03.319 --> 08:06.419
By the way, cleaning up alone might be too much work for Da Mi.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.490
Right.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.958
I'll go and help her.

08:09.959 --> 08:11.499
Can you do that?

08:11.500 --> 08:14.430
Then make sure to have lunch on your own.

08:14.730 --> 08:17.100
Good job getting the coffee.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.190
Hello?

08:35.620 --> 08:36.649
My daughter.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.219
- Hey, Mom. - Are you busy?

08:39.220 --> 08:41.830
No. I'm on my lunch break.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.429
Did something happen? You sound down.

08:45.529 --> 08:46.799
Nothing.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.798
What is it?

08:48.799 --> 08:51.469
I wanted to send you side dishes like stir-fried anchovies.

08:51.470 --> 08:54.139
You finished kimchi too, right? Should I send some kimchi too?

08:54.309 --> 08:55.969
I still have some left.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.739
You still have some left?

08:57.740 --> 09:00.209
You should eat better.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.548
Don't eat out all the time.

09:01.549 --> 09:04.178
Okay. I can take care of myself.

09:04.179 --> 09:07.080
Okay. Sorry to nag you.

09:09.190 --> 09:11.759
Do you need anything?

09:12.590 --> 09:14.289
I'll buy it as your birthday present when I visit you.

09:14.559 --> 09:17.359
No, you don't have to visit me. It's just another day.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.960
Then I'll pick your present.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.139
Oh, right. How are your knees? Are they feeling better?

09:24.240 --> 09:27.099
Yes. They're fine. They just ached a bit that day.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.969
Don't work in the restaurant anymore.

09:28.970 --> 09:30.038
You promised me.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.278
- Of course. - Hey.

09:32.279 --> 09:33.479
Did you finish washing the cabbages?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.979
Come and have some coffee.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.350
- Okay. - You're at the restaurant again.

09:37.779 --> 09:41.250
Gosh. You're wasting your lunch break on me. I'll call you later.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.460
Gosh. Why is she working at the restaurant again?

10:08.179 --> 10:09.580
I told you I was working late.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.179
You didn't have dinner yet. Right?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.620
It's sushi from the restaurant you like.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.490
You didn't have to bring me anything.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.389
You have to go back in, right?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.070
- Another beer, please. - Okay.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.499
I was running next to the cars while carrying the coffee.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.369
I wasn't scared at all then.

10:35.370 --> 10:39.039
So I got the coffee and went upstairs.

10:39.210 --> 10:41.710
But I found out that the CEO didn't drink coffee.

10:42.679 --> 10:47.620
And Da Mi said Ms. Kim lied to me. Do you think she did it on purpose?

10:48.490 --> 10:49.519
Well,

10:50.620 --> 10:54.259
so you want to know...

10:54.559 --> 10:57.629
if they lied to you or not. Right?

10:58.529 --> 11:00.299
Yes. That too.

11:01.169 --> 11:02.370
Fine. Let's say...

11:03.799 --> 11:05.370
they did lie to you.

11:06.169 --> 11:08.539
Why? Why do you think they lied to you?

11:09.610 --> 11:11.480
You were going to find out the truth anyway.

11:12.279 --> 11:13.340
Exactly.

11:13.710 --> 11:17.178
Why do they walk all over you?

11:17.179 --> 11:18.549
Let's think...

11:19.850 --> 11:22.888
if this wasn't your fault at all.

11:22.889 --> 11:25.058
- Jae Dong. - And...

11:25.059 --> 11:26.919
The real problem isn't their lie.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.029
The real problem is that you didn't go inside.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.668
Let's say you entered the conference room...

11:34.669 --> 11:36.269
while sweating like a pig with coffee in your hands.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.370
The CEO must have taken a shine on you.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.739
If you went in there and did your presentation,

11:41.740 --> 11:43.809
it would've been hitting the jackpot.

11:44.639 --> 11:45.980
Do you see that, Yeo Reum?

11:47.549 --> 11:51.750
Yeo Reum, it doesn't matter if they lied to you or not.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.590
The lack of trying on your part is the problem.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.259
What is it?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.600
Are you upset about what I said?

12:14.570 --> 12:16.909
You always liked teaching people.

12:17.679 --> 12:18.809
But...

12:20.340 --> 12:21.609
when we first met,

12:21.610 --> 12:25.179
you didn't get mad at me while lecturing me like this.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.220
Yeo Reum. I...

12:30.419 --> 12:32.389
I'm not mad.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.490
I'm not.

12:38.029 --> 12:39.559
You just exhaust me.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.669
Jae Dong.

13:01.049 --> 13:04.690
Jae Dong and I met in college and dated for six years.

13:06.590 --> 13:09.230
As time passed, we changed.

13:09.830 --> 13:14.299
At some point, I started to cling on to the idea of marriage.

13:17.070 --> 13:20.600
He probably didn't find me attractive anymore.

13:22.809 --> 13:26.779
(I know you're busy. I'm sorry to whine in front of you.)

13:30.149 --> 13:33.279
(I won't do that next time.)

13:39.360 --> 13:40.990
I shouldn't have gone.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.139
(Yeo Reum, we should take a break for the time being.)

14:03.850 --> 14:06.750
(What do you mean?)

14:12.019 --> 14:14.119
(You know what I mean. This will be good for both of us.)

14:14.120 --> 14:16.529
(Let's talk later.)

15:15.549 --> 15:17.320
Jae Dong has been radio-silent.

15:19.259 --> 15:22.330
This has happened before in our six-year relationship.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.758
But he always called me right back.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.830
Yeo Reum.

15:29.370 --> 15:30.370
Yeo Reum.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.870
- Yes? - What are you doing?

15:35.139 --> 15:36.370
Mr. Choi is calling you.

15:37.879 --> 15:39.210
I see. Yes.

15:42.179 --> 15:43.379
Come on in.

15:44.049 --> 15:47.379
It's been four years since you joined our company. Right?

15:47.990 --> 15:50.619
Yes. It's been 4 years and 3 months.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.090
I see.

15:53.190 --> 15:56.259
So you must be full of passion for your projects. Right?

15:58.759 --> 16:00.299
Is that why you're doing this?

16:04.100 --> 16:08.308
Well, the thing is, we only work with Jusung for our projects.

16:08.309 --> 16:10.840
And Jusung charges us 100,000 dollars.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.080
Yes. Keep going.

16:14.110 --> 16:15.779
I looked into other print shops.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.349
They use brand-new machines and charge only 80,000 dollars.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.090
I see. They charge 80,000 dollars.

16:21.419 --> 16:23.350
Then we can save 20,000 dollars. Right?

16:27.759 --> 16:31.960
Yeo Reum, do you know why I hired you?

16:33.299 --> 16:34.299
Do you?

16:35.769 --> 16:38.500
I'll be blunt. You're not a cunning type like Ms. Kim.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.110
You know what? You're like...

16:43.009 --> 16:45.439
Yes. Your strength is that...

16:45.440 --> 16:47.080
you keep your head down and work hard like a cow.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.110
That's your strength.

16:50.649 --> 16:53.649
Here's a thing about small companies like ours. Nothing is systemized.

16:53.950 --> 16:56.149
So people have to stick to what they're good at.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.058
So you can keep your head down and work diligently.

17:00.059 --> 17:04.259
Just do the job I give you. That's what I want from you. Okay?

17:06.359 --> 17:10.329
How dare you think you can change the print shop without my approval?

17:12.470 --> 17:14.298
What? Did you think this was your chance...

17:14.299 --> 17:15.909
since the CEO liked your proposal yesterday?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.068
Is that why?

17:17.069 --> 17:18.979
No. I'm sorry.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.549
Goodness. You're scary. I didn't know you were so ambitious.

17:22.279 --> 17:23.279
Yeo Reum.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.950
If we were in the military, do you know what you've been?

17:29.150 --> 17:32.390
A military dog. You're not a soldier yet.

17:33.190 --> 17:34.729
So don't do what I didn't ask.

17:34.730 --> 17:37.630
Don't try to get smart with me with that dull head of yours.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.299
Goodness. Nothing is easy.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.500
I'm starving.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.559
Why can't I catch a break?

19:09.420 --> 19:10.549
Hello?

19:15.289 --> 19:18.059
(Emergency Room)

19:22.769 --> 19:24.029
Take your card.

19:27.039 --> 19:30.609
(Emergency Room)

19:39.380 --> 19:41.319
- Yeo Reum! - Hey!

19:46.720 --> 19:48.029
What are we going to do now?

19:49.130 --> 19:50.329
What about Mom?

19:50.390 --> 19:54.230
I had a drink with my friends when we were fishing.

19:54.430 --> 19:57.400
- And the police called me. - Where's Mom?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.240
Mom...

20:00.799 --> 20:02.970
Mom... Where is she?

20:53.519 --> 20:54.589
Is this her?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.369
Mom.

21:36.569 --> 21:37.599
Mom...

21:44.980 --> 21:46.309
Mom...

21:47.039 --> 21:48.609
- Mom... - Yeo Reum.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.750
Go to sleep already.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.950
We have to get up early to go see your dad tomorrow.

21:57.990 --> 21:58.990
Mom.

21:59.890 --> 22:03.359
I still smell garlic when I miss you.

22:04.430 --> 22:05.599
Why would you do that?

22:07.529 --> 22:10.700
You used to come home after working at the restaurant.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.970
You always came home around the time we fell asleep.

22:14.869 --> 22:17.440
Then you used to stroke my hair.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.380
And your hands smelled like garlic.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.220
Sorry.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.190
Why are you sorry?

22:33.220 --> 22:35.759
Someone else should be apologizing, not you.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.099
You mean Dad?

22:39.299 --> 22:42.130
Seriously. He's going to make up for everything when we meet again.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.929
What will you make him do?

22:43.930 --> 22:47.799
First of all, I won't lift a finger.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.269
And I'll only sleep.

22:51.339 --> 22:54.750
Whatever. I'll make him do all the chores.

22:58.980 --> 22:59.980
Mom.

23:01.619 --> 23:04.250
I'll do everything for you.

23:05.289 --> 23:06.960
I'll make a lot of money,

23:07.460 --> 23:10.429
so I can take you out to look at flowers...

23:10.430 --> 23:12.659
and take you to the beach too.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.059
I'll do everything for you.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.400
So don't age too quickly.

23:34.990 --> 23:37.589
- Yeo Reum. - Yes?

23:38.920 --> 23:40.019
I love you.

23:41.660 --> 23:42.759
Me too.

23:47.460 --> 23:51.569
My mom never got a chance to rest.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.490
You don't have to come out. Go back inside.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.930
Thanks for coming.

24:55.329 --> 24:56.369
Don't mention it.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.099
I didn't think you'd come.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.140
I can't believe she passed away out of the blue.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.640
You must be devastated.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.180
(Our Deepest Condolences)

25:09.279 --> 25:10.980
I'm sorry I can't stay.

25:16.619 --> 25:17.920
Say your last farewell to her.

25:20.490 --> 25:22.160
Make sure to eat when you can...

25:24.089 --> 25:25.700
and sleep when you can.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
Okay?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.140
Stay strong.

25:37.940 --> 25:39.109
You can do it, right?

25:55.190 --> 25:57.690
You should go back inside. I'll get going.

26:13.880 --> 26:17.109
Just like that, everyone left.

26:21.950 --> 26:24.250
Mom now rests right next to Dad.

26:26.789 --> 26:29.259
Mom must've met Dad by now.

26:29.660 --> 26:32.559
I bet she's bossing him around right now.

26:36.269 --> 26:39.440
I really hope she is.

26:59.289 --> 27:02.059
(To Lee Yeo Reum)

27:45.740 --> 27:47.039
Hi, my baby.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.609
How come you sound so tired these days?

27:52.210 --> 27:53.839
You don't have to visit me on my birthday.

27:54.910 --> 27:56.950
I hope my side dishes cheer you up.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.079
I love you.

28:01.789 --> 28:02.890
From Mom.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.869
Mom...

28:30.980 --> 28:32.380
Mom...

28:41.690 --> 28:43.589
I'm sorry, Mom.

28:51.069 --> 28:53.000
I go to work.

28:56.670 --> 28:58.579
Then I come home.

29:00.779 --> 29:01.880
I go to work,

29:05.549 --> 29:06.720
then come home again.

29:10.319 --> 29:11.390
Go to work.

29:12.619 --> 29:13.660
Come home.

29:16.259 --> 29:17.390
Go to work again.

29:23.269 --> 29:25.700
I'm still living,

29:26.500 --> 29:27.670
but barely.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.109
Yeo Reum, you'll break your wrists at that rate.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.920
Gosh, it's so loud and distracting.

29:39.579 --> 29:40.849
I'm sorry.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.289
Yeo Reum, can you go wash my cup for me?

29:47.359 --> 29:49.089
Come on. My arm's getting tired.

29:54.230 --> 29:56.299
Nothing has changed.

29:57.329 --> 30:01.400
Perhaps nothing happened.

30:20.490 --> 30:22.359
Every day, the exact same sun goes down...

30:30.130 --> 30:31.470
and comes up.

30:36.839 --> 30:39.140
The world hasn't changed at all.

30:47.480 --> 30:50.119
But I've become an orphan.

30:57.890 --> 31:01.559
This stop is Samsong.

31:02.230 --> 31:04.500
The doors are on your right.

31:05.130 --> 31:08.740
This stop is Samsong.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.209
- The doors are on your right. - Oh, wait.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.109
Sir, hold on.

31:14.410 --> 31:16.349
No, wait! Just one moment!

31:19.079 --> 31:22.289
What is this? Darn it.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.220
What a way to ruin my morning.

31:25.390 --> 31:27.319
What a nuisance!

31:28.119 --> 31:30.189
Wait, sir!

31:30.190 --> 31:33.559
The doors are closing. Stand clear of the closing doors.

31:59.119 --> 32:03.329
(Mr. Choi, I think I'll be about 20 minutes late.)

32:36.890 --> 32:38.028
It's spring.

32:38.029 --> 32:39.500
The screen doors are opening.

32:49.839 --> 32:52.680
The doors are closing.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.730
I'm not going to work.

33:11.359 --> 33:13.259
(Way Out)

33:46.630 --> 33:48.970
(Manager Choi Ji Won)

34:03.950 --> 34:07.480
The subway car moving away from Seoul on a weekday morning...

34:09.389 --> 34:12.090
was so quiet and peaceful...

34:13.260 --> 34:17.489
that I almost felt as though I had been transported to another world.

34:39.119 --> 34:42.590
Perhaps, life isn't any different.

34:43.789 --> 34:46.989
If you go in the opposite direction of everyone else,

34:48.059 --> 34:51.460
you may be able to find a quiet, peaceful path...

34:52.760 --> 34:54.260
that isn't as crowded.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.050
Am I losing my mind?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.428
(Missed Calls from Manager Choi Ji Won)

35:24.429 --> 35:25.730
(Come to the office as soon as you see this.)

35:26.429 --> 35:27.530
Right.

35:28.730 --> 35:30.429
I'm not going to work.

35:34.369 --> 35:36.769
(Manager Choi Ji Won)

35:40.480 --> 35:41.610
Hello?

35:41.739 --> 35:44.380
Hey, where are you now? Have you lost your mind?

35:45.150 --> 35:46.679
Why didn't you pick up earlier?

35:47.349 --> 35:48.380
Mr. Choi.

35:50.449 --> 35:53.420
Do you think you won't be reprimanded after this?

35:57.230 --> 36:00.699
I'm sorry. I quit.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.070
What? What are you saying...

36:27.059 --> 36:29.860
Yeo Reum, I was so surprised.

36:30.159 --> 36:31.489
Are you really leaving?

36:32.929 --> 36:35.360
Gosh, what am I going to do without you?

36:36.070 --> 36:37.630
You'll be fine, Da Mi.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.768
Da Mi, can you make a photocopy of this?

36:39.769 --> 36:40.869
Sure.

36:43.739 --> 36:46.840
Yeo Reum, can we talk?

36:56.650 --> 37:01.320
Goodness. You can't quit so suddenly.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.829
Are you getting married or something?

37:05.800 --> 37:06.829
No.

37:07.530 --> 37:09.929
Come on. Why are you already so awkward around us?

37:10.030 --> 37:13.000
Why are we standing around? Let's sit down.

37:13.139 --> 37:15.170
I was hard on you, wasn't I?

37:15.400 --> 37:18.940
Sometimes, I'm just too eager.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.449
Yeo Reum, I'm saying this because I think of you as my sister.

37:26.719 --> 37:30.690
You probably won't believe me, but I went to a small-town college too.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.488
I studied engineering at a small-town college.

37:34.489 --> 37:36.559
And I'm managing Planning Team One now.

37:37.329 --> 37:38.730
Guess what it must've been like for me.

37:39.159 --> 37:41.059
Of course, it wasn't easy.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.400
I had to pour drinks and entertain my seniors to win them over.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.739
Compared to back then, this is nothing. Well, anyway...

37:48.170 --> 37:50.110
My point is,

37:50.570 --> 37:53.340
you can't afford to take a career break right now.

37:53.579 --> 37:56.479
He's right. I mean, a short break is fine.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.678
But think about when you'd have to start working again.

37:58.679 --> 38:01.750
Yeo Reum, you can trust me.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.319
I got you. You know that, right?

38:03.320 --> 38:04.919
All you have to do is stand behind me.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.659
Then you'll climb the ladder in no time!

38:08.789 --> 38:11.089
Thank you for saying that.

38:11.090 --> 38:13.300
- Oh, come on. - But...

38:14.929 --> 38:17.030
I'm just going to quit.

38:23.010 --> 38:28.239
The CEO is expecting me. Please excuse me.

38:29.150 --> 38:30.449
Yeo Reum.

38:32.110 --> 38:35.150
Darn it. Are you really that dense?

38:37.619 --> 38:38.789
So you'll quit?

38:39.420 --> 38:41.059
Okay. You'll quit?

38:42.860 --> 38:45.929
Sure, go ahead and quit. Let's see what you can do.

38:46.099 --> 38:47.299
Mr. Choi.

38:47.300 --> 38:51.170
Gosh, I was going to keep her on for a bit as my errand girl.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.538
Darn it. Youngsters these days are so impatient.

38:54.539 --> 38:56.669
It irks me so much that she and I...

38:56.670 --> 38:58.170
technically belong to the same generation.

39:01.110 --> 39:02.110
Darn you...

39:05.719 --> 39:06.780
"Darn you?"

39:08.619 --> 39:09.920
Who? Me?

39:10.650 --> 39:11.750
Yeo Reum.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.659
Don't call me impatient when you've made it utterly intolerable.

39:19.929 --> 39:22.000
Why do I have to get chewed out even as I'm leaving the company?

39:23.030 --> 39:25.269
Yeo Reum, don't be like this.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.139
He's saying these things for your sake.

39:29.110 --> 39:30.440
For my sake?

39:31.570 --> 39:32.710
No, that's not true.

39:34.309 --> 39:36.349
He's just worried that I'd tell the CEO...

39:36.909 --> 39:39.518
about him taking bribes.

39:39.519 --> 39:40.579
Hey!

39:45.619 --> 39:47.460
- Stop. - Hey!

39:47.889 --> 39:50.158
Hey, do you want to fight?

39:50.159 --> 39:51.788
- You little... - Gosh!

39:51.789 --> 39:53.329
Calm down!

39:54.760 --> 39:55.969
Apologize.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.069
Hey, have you really lost your mind?

39:58.070 --> 39:59.669
Apologize to me, both of you.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.239
You really have lost your mind!

40:01.500 --> 40:03.639
You received 20,000 dollars from Jusung.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.609
And you're afraid I'd tell the CEO about it.

40:06.610 --> 40:08.280
You crazy little...

40:09.179 --> 40:11.678
I must teach you a lesson. Let's go talk to the CEO together.

40:11.679 --> 40:13.179
No, wait!

40:14.050 --> 40:16.989
Yeo Reum, pull yourself together. Why are you being like this?

40:17.449 --> 40:19.590
Get it together, will you?

40:20.420 --> 40:22.018
He asks every female employee...

40:22.019 --> 40:23.828
to go drink, sing karaoke, and sleep with him.

40:23.829 --> 40:24.959
Hey, shut it!

40:24.960 --> 40:27.459
He went to you because I wouldn't give him a chance.

40:27.460 --> 40:28.599
Hey!

40:29.730 --> 40:32.569
You mean, I... I hit on you?

40:32.570 --> 40:35.299
She's clearly lost it.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.769
Shall I show her the text message?

40:37.710 --> 40:40.308
- What? Is this true? - What text message?

40:40.309 --> 40:42.139
This girl scares me.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.379
- What is this? - You believe her?

40:44.380 --> 40:45.550
She's lying!

40:46.920 --> 40:48.718
The CEO is looking for Yeo Reum.

40:48.719 --> 40:49.949
Okay!

40:51.320 --> 40:52.959
- What is this text message? - Nothing.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.558
- Show me your phone. - I said it was nothing.

40:54.559 --> 40:56.029
- Hand it over. - I told you she was lying.

40:56.030 --> 40:57.959
- Hand it over! Where is it? - Hold on.

40:57.960 --> 41:00.159
- Where is your phone? - Wait, hold on.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.369
Calm down. Hey, calm down, okay?

41:03.929 --> 41:06.099
So if I...

41:06.940 --> 41:08.199
Will you let it go if I apologize?

41:08.840 --> 41:11.368
I'm sorry. I must've been out of my mind...

41:11.369 --> 41:13.210
I mean, I'm sorry.

41:13.809 --> 41:14.909
Forgive me.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.579
I don't care what you two do.

41:21.849 --> 41:24.289
But you at least shouldn't make others suffer because of you.

41:24.989 --> 41:27.519
Okay, I won't.

41:54.949 --> 41:58.489
Excuse me. Could you let me out?

42:00.489 --> 42:01.519
Thank you.

42:06.559 --> 42:09.099
I've lived my life in a daze.

42:11.429 --> 42:12.940
In order not to fall behind...

42:13.940 --> 42:15.469
and not to be criticized,

42:16.510 --> 42:17.909
I held out with all my might.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.780
But looking back now,

42:22.579 --> 42:25.010
I realize that I always criticized myself more harshly...

42:25.780 --> 42:28.449
than anybody else ever did.

42:41.099 --> 42:42.629
How big is the land?

42:42.630 --> 42:44.670
Only 3,300m².

42:44.730 --> 42:46.340
My brother's farmland is 6,600m².

42:46.800 --> 42:48.670
Oh, my. That's big.

42:48.769 --> 42:51.669
Come on. You need at least 3,300m² to grow potatoes.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.110
It'd better rain soon.

42:55.710 --> 42:57.579
Everything is drying up.

42:58.179 --> 43:00.219
I know. There is nothing we can do.

43:34.050 --> 43:36.420
My monthly paychecks of 2,380 dollars.

43:37.789 --> 43:40.360
I traded my time for those paychecks.

43:42.860 --> 43:45.530
From now on, I want to use my time...

43:47.099 --> 43:49.260
for myself and myself only.

44:00.940 --> 44:05.510
As you know, I'm very picky when it comes to choosing who I delegate to.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.389
So think of this as your opportunity to shine...

44:10.019 --> 44:12.250
and do a good job.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.219
- Do your best. - Okay.

44:14.559 --> 44:17.158
But wasn't this Ms. Kim's task?

44:17.159 --> 44:19.499
Why is that important?

44:19.500 --> 44:22.260
We're all a team. Teamwork is what matters, right?

44:22.559 --> 44:24.099
- Yes. - Go.

44:29.710 --> 44:30.769
- Hey, look. - Gosh!

44:31.170 --> 44:33.309
You disgusting pervert.

44:36.150 --> 44:38.979
- Mr. Choi did this? - My gosh, I can't believe it.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.749
- This is disgusting. - I know.

44:41.750 --> 44:42.849
(Literature Village, Planning Team One)

44:44.119 --> 44:45.619
(Lee Yeo Reum)

44:47.659 --> 44:49.629
(- Come to Hotel the Lover. - Hotel?)

44:49.630 --> 44:51.789
(Yes, Hotel the Lover. Yeo Reum, why aren't you picking up?)

44:58.199 --> 44:59.500
Hey, Mr. Choi!

46:45.139 --> 46:46.909
This is nice.

46:58.150 --> 47:01.019
From now on, I'll do nothing.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.360
I'm going on strike against this thing called life.

47:46.340 --> 47:49.300
(Summer Strike)

47:49.610 --> 47:51.769
A man can be destroyed...

47:52.269 --> 47:53.579
but not defeated.

47:54.179 --> 47:56.980
Yes. Here, I won't worry about what others may think of me.

47:57.110 --> 47:58.178
I'll do whatever I want.

47:58.179 --> 48:00.448
Oh, my. Look at that young lady.

48:00.449 --> 48:01.820
She's really something.

48:01.980 --> 48:05.388
How much did she drink that she fell asleep at the library?

48:05.389 --> 48:07.059
- I'm sorry. - Okay!

48:07.789 --> 48:10.389
You can move out anytime.

48:10.530 --> 48:12.460
I have nothing more to lose anyway.

48:12.690 --> 48:15.500
No more regrets. I'll live my life to the fullest.

48:15.559 --> 48:16.929
I can do it!
