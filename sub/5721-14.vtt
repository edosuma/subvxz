[elevator bell dings]

00:04.740 --> 00:07.174
DIANE:
Welcome to Lockhart,
Agos & Lee.

00:07.220 --> 00:10.041
As you probably know,
we are an all-service law firm

00:10.090 --> 00:12.399
with a rich tradition.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.829
The firm was formed
12 years ago

00:14.880 --> 00:16.836
by Jonas Stern and myself,

00:16.880 --> 00:18.268
Diane Lockhart.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.481
Last year,
the firm reconstituted itself

00:20.540 --> 00:24.055
with Cary A905 and David Lee
as name partners.

00:24.110 --> 00:27.932
We occupy two floors
in the Dryden Building--

00:27.980 --> 00:30.801
the executive suite
on the 28th floor

00:30.850 --> 00:32.806
and the 27th floor,
where support staff

00:32.850 --> 00:34.898
and most associates work.

00:34.940 --> 00:37.898
As a new associate,
you will be given a card key

00:37.950 --> 00:40.111
for your assigned floor,

00:40.170 --> 00:43.128
and you will be provided
an employee handbook.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.728
Due to severe overcrowding,

00:44.780 --> 00:46.941
not all of you
will receive an office.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.219
Some of you may have to work
from cubicles for the moment.

00:50.260 --> 00:51.739
Lastly,

00:51.790 --> 00:55.521
Lockhart, Agos & Lee
is a true meritocracy.

00:55.570 --> 00:58.698
One of our name partners came
from where you sit now

00:58.750 --> 01:00.968
in a mere six years.

01:01.010 --> 01:04.889
It can be done,
and we expect no less of you.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.660
So give yourself
a hand.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.974
[applause]

01:18.030 --> 01:19.986
[ding]

01:20.030 --> 01:23.204
Well, look at you,
big-time lavwer.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.639
Well, look at you,
coming back home.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.942
Yep. Not much has changed.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.900
Did we make a mistake?

01:29.950 --> 01:31.906
I don't know. We'll see.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.177
CARY:
Hey, Alicia.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.658
God. This is really weird.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.952
I know,
but not bad weird, is it?

01:39.010 --> 01:41.706
Not yet.Well,

01:41.750 --> 01:43.877
first things first,
there's no room on the 28th.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.615
I know.There might be soon.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.275
But you will have
the biggest office on the 27th.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.015
Hey, it's where
I started out.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.142
It's where we started out.

01:52.190 --> 01:54.750
And I'm on the 27th, too.
So we can pass notes.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.232
Aw, that's nice.[phone chimes]

01:59.290 --> 02:00.985
Eh, something from the partners.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.930
I have to get
back upstairs,

02:02.990 --> 02:05.504
but drop by and
we'll catch a bite.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.597
It's great to
have you back.Thanks.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.333
Oh, Lucca, I have to introduce
you at some point to Monica.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.290
Oh, we've already met.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.251
CARY: Oh-oh, right,
yeah. On the other, um,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.996
Chumhum case.
Well, you'll love her.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.136
Shall we drink that now?

02:20.180 --> 02:21.397
[chuckles]

02:21.440 --> 02:22.748
Oh.

02:22.790 --> 02:23.950
Yeah,

02:24.010 --> 02:25.352
I'd hire you.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.879
HOWELL: Alicia,
I think I need to hire you.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.138
Do you remember me? I'm Howell.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.794
[click]

02:30.840 --> 02:32.831
Uh, yes, hello.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.926
Um, this is Lucca Quinn.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.403
Howell is the_ firm's
technology director.

02:37.460 --> 02:39.712
I-I don't think
I know your last name.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.886
Just Howell.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.714
Anyway, I have something

02:42.770 --> 02:44.374
seriously incredible
to show you.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.376
So, last night my
girlfriend Amy and I go

02:46.420 --> 02:47.728
to the closing night
of Deviceroy.

02:49.950 --> 02:51.906
It's the consumer
electronics show.

02:51.950 --> 02:53.724
Like the big CES one in Vegas

02:53.780 --> 02:57.773
but without the hookers
or Cirque du Soleil. So,

02:57.820 --> 03:00.994
monster after-party,
15,000 people.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.859
End of the night, Amy
finds something on the floor

03:02.920 --> 03:05.218
under a table. So
she gives It to me.

03:05.270 --> 03:07.909
I wake up this morning. Ooh.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.780
I realize what it is.ALICIA: What what is?

03:10.840 --> 03:13.877
HOWELL: The Foil. The new
Chumhum tablet. Their big

03:13.930 --> 03:16.922
contribution to the gadget
market. Comes out in two months.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.403
I don't understand.
Someone just left it there?

03:18.450 --> 03:20.884
Yeah. So I tweeted
a picture of it.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.841
Next thing I know, two different
tech blogs are calling me

03:22.890 --> 03:24.539
so they can be the first
to review it.

03:24.590 --> 03:26.546
Gadgy's offering me 100 grand.

03:26.590 --> 03:28.546
$100,000?

03:28.590 --> 03:32.412
Scoops like this are like the
Pentagon Papersto these sites.

03:32.470 --> 03:34.859
They want an answer in an hour.
So I need to know

03:34.910 --> 03:37.947
_ ifI can sell it_and
If you'll negotiate It for me.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.468
I, uh...Yeah. Sure.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.988
$100,000?Lucca, uh,

03:43.040 --> 03:44.689
let's just take a minute
on this, okay?

03:44.740 --> 03:46.731
Just give us a minute.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.266
This could be sticlq.

03:51.310 --> 03:55.053
One Selfie. Mango,
carrot, ginger, kale, mint,

03:55.100 --> 03:56.920
apple, bee pollen.Thank you.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.483
That's going to be disgusting,
just so you know.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.794
What is a Selfie?It's a make-your-own.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.579
You're supposed
to take a picture with it

04:03.630 --> 04:05.018
and post it online.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.196
I know, right?

04:07.240 --> 04:10.368
Um, and what is an "Arlen-ergy"?

04:10.420 --> 04:12.194
It's pronounced "Arlenergy."

04:12.250 --> 04:15.071
Like "energy" but with
an "Arlene" in front of it.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.078
[chuckles]It's named
after our owner.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.076
Juices _are the new
vanity plates.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.166
Well, what do you recommend?

04:21.210 --> 04:23.940
The juice bar down the street.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.422
It's half the price.Mmm.
[chuckles]

04:25.480 --> 04:26.993
Or a NutMegan.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.782
I'll take the "Arlene-ergy."

04:29.830 --> 04:31.821
'Cause I'm a_s_ucker
for advertlsmg.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.041
Is that why you bought
that shirt, advertising?

04:34.090 --> 04:36.399
You don't like my shirt?Actually, I do.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.873
But very few girls
would say that.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.875
Hey.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.398
Um...

04:43.450 --> 04:45.498
do you get a lunch break?

04:45.540 --> 04:50.102
It's not Europe,
so I only get an hour.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.492
[whirring]

04:53.160 --> 04:54.286
So good to have you back.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.581
Thank you.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.198
Home is where
they take you in, right?

04:57.250 --> 04:58.467
Happily take you in.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.068
Um, and you know Lucca.Yes.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.680
Early this morning. I have
to introduce you to Monica.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.947
I think you'll
like each other.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.685
We were across the table
from each other,

05:05.740 --> 05:06.946
on the Chummy Maps case.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.956
Oh. Right.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.913
So, uh, you haven't even sat
down yet and you have something?

05:12.960 --> 05:14.393
Yes. Howell.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.919
Our I.T. guy.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.916
Right. Uh, Cary
briefed me.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.316
How is this tablet not
conSIdered stolen property?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.225
It was abandoned.
It's more accurately defined

05:23.270 --> 05:24.532
as lost property.

05:24.580 --> 05:26.832
Uh, by law, Howell has

05:26.890 --> 05:28.846
to give the owner
a chance to recover.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.233
He has to at least attempt

05:31.280 --> 05:32.975
constructive notice.Not by law.

05:34.020 --> 05:36.193
Lucca, can you give us a minute?

05:43.120 --> 05:45.076
[door shuts]

05:45.120 --> 05:46.849
We can't be a
part of this.She's right

05:46.910 --> 05:49.333
on the law.
And how it's enforced.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.029
We can't risk a lawsuit
from Chumhum over a casual favor

05:52.090 --> 05:53.387
to an employee.[knocking]

05:57.400 --> 06:00.392
LUCCA:
Just to confirm,
this call is being recorded

06:00.440 --> 06:03.000
for quality
and training purposes?MAN: Yes, it is, ma'am.

06:03.050 --> 06:05.132
How may I help you?DIANE:
What is this?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.135
Chumhum Customer
Service.How may I help you?

06:07.190 --> 06:08.885
Hi. Uh, I have
in my possession

06:08.930 --> 06:12.366
a prototype
of the new Foil tablet.

06:12.410 --> 06:15.322
I'm sorry... Excuse me?The Foil tablet.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.099
I have it.That's not possible, ma'am.

06:17.150 --> 06:20.062
It is, because I have it.The Foil will be released

06:20.110 --> 06:21.509
inﬁme
for back-to-school sales.

06:21.550 --> 06:23.245
Would you like me
to give you the Web address?

06:23.290 --> 06:25.633
No. Uh, could I speak
to a supervisor?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.113
I am a supervisor.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.118
Ah. So you have authority
to answer my questions?

06:30.170 --> 06:33.071
That's correct.Then could you advise me
on the best way to return

06:33.130 --> 06:35.121
the tablet to the company?It's not the Foil, ma'am.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.638
The Foil will be released in
time for back-to-school sales.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.088
So I can keep it?

06:39.130 --> 06:40.119
Whatever you have, you can keep.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.000
Shall I direct you
to the Web site?

06:44.180 --> 06:46.136
Constructive notice given

06:46.180 --> 06:48.262
and rejected.Howell is now firmly in

06:48.320 --> 06:51.483
the "finders keepers" territory,
and we can help him sell it.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.185
Why don't you give us
a minute.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.716
So this is bureaucracy.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.194
[door shuts]

07:02.240 --> 07:04.231
The Israeli Army? Really?

07:04.290 --> 07:06.542
Yeah. But it's not
like I shot anyone.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.160
One time I did this great thing
along the Egyptian border.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.168
They have these
five-women sharpshooter teams

07:12.210 --> 07:14.075
camouflaged in the desert.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.168
You stay all night in a pod

07:16.210 --> 07:18.383
about the size
of these two tables.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.648
Five women, all night,

07:20.700 --> 07:22.645
and all you can do is whisper.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.656
It's really terrifying
but really cool.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.304
Did you see any terrorists?

07:26.350 --> 07:29.831
No. Bedouin nomads, mostly.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.704
Now I'm here in this stupid
juice bar 3,000 miles away.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.059
It's 11:00 pm. in Israel

07:37.100 --> 07:40.319
and my friends are slipping
into their desert pods right now

07:40.370 --> 07:43.624
and I'm... here talking to you.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.238
Weird.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.587
Yeah.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.586
Were your parents afraid
of you being over there?

07:49.640 --> 07:52.416
Of getting
stabbed, no.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.893
Of turning
Orthodox, yes.[chuckles]

07:54.950 --> 07:57.510
Actually, just my mom
was. She's the wormNart.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.903
My dad was too busy
to notice I was gone.

07:59.950 --> 08:01.770
Mmm. Why?

08:01.820 --> 08:03.082
What does he do?

08:03.130 --> 08:05.086
You know Governor
Peter Florrick?

08:05.130 --> 08:07.348
Sure.He's his chief
of staff.

08:07.390 --> 08:08.607
[coughs]Or...

08:08.660 --> 08:10.343
was. Then wasn't.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.176
Now is again, I think.
[chuckles]

08:13.230 --> 08:14.447
Hmm.

08:14.490 --> 08:16.139
I know.

08:16.190 --> 08:17.612
He also ran Peter's campaign
for president.

08:17.670 --> 08:19.228
So he must have
every

08:19.280 --> 08:22.147
rich person in Illinois
knocking down his door.Eh.

08:22.190 --> 08:23.919
He's a dork.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.538
Although I was Alicia Florrick's

08:25.590 --> 08:28.150
body woman for her campaign
for state's attorney,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.361
which he also ran.And Alicia Florrick?

08:30.420 --> 08:32.547
What was it like working
for her?

08:37.290 --> 08:39.338
You are a curious one,
aren't you?

08:39.380 --> 08:42.292
No. I just... I don't meet
too many, you know, like,

08:42.340 --> 08:44.296
Malcolm Gladwell
connector types.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.127
So, tell me about you.
What do you do?

08:47.170 --> 08:49.821
I'm a student. Nothing exciting.

08:49.870 --> 08:52.782
Nothing like dealing
with a lot of campaign money.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.219
Yeah, I know. What do you study?

08:55.270 --> 08:57.613
Computers. Programming.

08:57.660 --> 09:00.788
Really? Tell me more.[chuckles]

09:00.840 --> 09:01.875
Dad.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.704
I'm busy, Marissa.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.399
A young man asked me
to lunch today.Congratulations.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.327
Let me know when I have
to spring for a wedding.

09:08.370 --> 09:09.803
His name was Scott Devereaux,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.579
and he had a lot of questions
about you.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.325
I don't know him.Questions like

09:13.370 --> 09:16.726
who you have dinner with,
who gives money to the campaign,

09:16.770 --> 09:19.762
how often you talk
with Alicia.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.765
What is this again?

09:21.820 --> 09:23.720
A young man took me to lunch
but had much more interest

09:23.780 --> 09:25.589
in you than in me.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.641
He said
he was a student.What's he look like?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.389
I trained you well.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.470
Oh, my God. He's an FBI agent.

09:37.530 --> 09:39.998
What's his name?Scott Devereaux.

09:40.050 --> 09:42.006
No, no, no.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.790
Hlavin.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.831
Roland Hlavin. What did he ask?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.359
Did he mention a judge?
Schakowslq?

09:47.410 --> 09:48.707
No. Why?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.854
What did he ask?

10:01.900 --> 10:04.414
...Malcolm Gladwell
connector types.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.813
So, tell me about you.
What do you do?

10:06.860 --> 10:08.202
I'm a student.You recorded it.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.865
Nothing exciting.I did.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.869
Nothing like dealing
with a lot of campaign money.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.389
Yeah, I know...What?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.658
It's just... Now I get
why people have children.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.045
They can admire themselves
in someone else.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.314
Hi.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.316
Ma'am.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.624
How do you like my office?

10:31.670 --> 10:33.399
It's got a view.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.179
What do you think?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.322
Look at my chair.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.018
[clang]

10:42.070 --> 10:44.721
I like it. It fits you.

10:44.770 --> 10:45.668
Off-center?

10:45.730 --> 10:47.243
Tilted.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.894
[chuckles]

10:48.950 --> 10:51.555
How do you keep your beard
that length?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.556
I mean, at a certain point,
you're either clean-shaven

10:53.600 --> 10:55.739
or you're Abraham Lincoln,
right?No.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.862
It stays like this. Since birth.

10:57.910 --> 11:00.470
[click]

11:02.570 --> 11:04.470
We kissed.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.449
I know.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.708
So what
do we do now?

11:10.750 --> 11:13.924
I don't know.
I'm not big on planning.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.369
Do you think
it will be weird for us--

11:15.410 --> 11:17.014
working in a corporate setting?

11:17.060 --> 11:18.459
Well,

11:18.500 --> 11:19.842
I'm freelance.

11:19.890 --> 11:21.016
You are.

11:21.070 --> 11:23.846
You're freelance.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.978
Okay.
You know, they probably

11:32.030 --> 11:34.248
want me to work.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.861
So good seeing you, workmate.

11:37.910 --> 11:40.470
You too.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.872
[computer clings]

11:54.010 --> 11:55.875
Oh, come on.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.409
Seriously, you're dropping it?

12:00.450 --> 12:02.452
It makes us nervous.Howell's an employee.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.934
He needs your help.

12:04.980 --> 12:07.107
Yes, but we are
in a weird place with Chumhum.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.934
We don't really
want to poke the bear.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.982
Wow, things have really
changed around here.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.594
What's that?

12:16.640 --> 12:18.858
You're back home.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.389
It's always
exciting here.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.566
Hello, my name's Perry Dunst.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.168
I'm with the
TAPS unit.What unit?

12:27.220 --> 12:29.120
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Drummond Howell.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.341
On what charges?Trafficking in
stolen property.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.095
That's him
right there,

12:33.140 --> 12:35.779
gray sweater.
Go ahead and cuff him.DIANE: What is TAPS?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.319
DUNST:
Mr. Howell, please
get on your knees,

12:37.360 --> 12:38.793
put your hands
behind your head.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.751
What the hell's going on?Howell,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.927
don't say anything. We're
Mr. Howell's lawyers. May I see

12:42.970 --> 12:44.403
that warrant?

12:44.450 --> 12:45.929
Ma'am, please
stay back.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.584
Howell, stay calm.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.621
We will
take care of this.

12:51.940 --> 12:55.023
Who are those guys?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.521
[indistinct conversations,
phones ringing]

13:12.830 --> 13:14.479
Three years?

13:14.530 --> 13:17.044
I didn't sell
anyone this prototype.Did you

13:17.100 --> 13:19.318
speak to anyone besides
us about the possibility

13:19.360 --> 13:21.225
of selling?Just Amy,

13:21.270 --> 13:23.409
my girlfriend. You got
to keep her out of this.

13:23.450 --> 13:25.270
We will. Just remember,
whatever these agents ask,

13:25.320 --> 13:27.049
we do the talking.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.408
I thought you weren't
representing me.We weren't.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.678
Now it's the firm.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.620
Hello.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.840
DIANE:
Mr. Gross.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.504
Ah, it's the law firm that's

13:36.550 --> 13:38.859
the perpetual stone in my shoe.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.028
So, uh, you seem
to have something of mine.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.810
CARY: Sir, I think we should
handle this through lawyers.I've spoken to Agent Dunst,

13:44.860 --> 13:47.590
he's agreed to drop the
charges-- lucky you-- if you

13:47.650 --> 13:49.515
return my prototype,
and if you give me

13:49.560 --> 13:51.289
the name of the person
who gave it to you.

13:51.350 --> 13:52.647
Why do you need the name?

13:52.700 --> 13:55.521
Mrs. Florrick.

13:55.570 --> 13:57.697
I'm sorry
about your husband's loss.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.139
Thank you.
Why do you need the name?

13:59.180 --> 14:00.659
Chumhum's suffered
an unprecedented

14:00.700 --> 14:01.962
security breach.
I need to know

14:02.010 --> 14:04.478
exactly what went wrong
so I can make sure

14:04.530 --> 14:06.612
it never _
happens again.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.626
ALICIA:
Howell won't give up
his girlfriend.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.228
_ Even_ if it means
gomg to Jail for three years?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.929
Yes.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.709
Why are they
allowing Neil Gross

14:13.760 --> 14:15.978
into an
interrogation room?ALICIA: I don't know.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.544
And why is he the one
making the offer?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.581
Have you ever
heard of TAPS before?

14:19.640 --> 14:21.505
Neven

14:23.680 --> 14:25.409
So what's
going on here?

14:28.040 --> 14:29.985
Hello, Don.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.167
What the hell
are you doing here, Eli?

14:32.210 --> 14:33.609
I just need a minute.

14:33.650 --> 14:34.730
You wearing a wire?

14:34.780 --> 14:36.213
No. Are you?

14:36.260 --> 14:37.602
Why would I be?

14:37.650 --> 14:39.436
Is that a yes
or a no?

14:39.480 --> 14:42.210
It's a no, Eli.
I wasn't expecting to see you

14:42.270 --> 14:43.749
in my chambers.

14:43.790 --> 14:46.042
I come bearing bad news.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.055
Of course you do.

14:47.100 --> 14:47.998
I think the E31
is Investigating

14:48.060 --> 14:51.279
our... business last year.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.276
They're certainly
investigating something.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.049
They were here?Roland Hlavin.

14:55.110 --> 14:57.499
That little smartass.What was he asking?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.496
He was asking
about Alicia Florrick.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.542
Alicia?

15:02.590 --> 15:04.148
TAPS--

15:04.200 --> 15:06.805
Technology Allied
Protection Service.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.158
What is that?It is a multi-
agency task force

15:09.210 --> 15:11.986
that works with Silicon Valley's
biggest companies

15:12.040 --> 15:14.725
to clamp down on
technology theft.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.122
The iPolice?

15:16.170 --> 15:17.728
Yeah.There is such a thing?

15:17.780 --> 15:20.340
Oh, yeah. And you want
to know something interesting?

15:20.390 --> 15:22.950
More interesting
than the iPolice?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.174
Lead agent over there,
Dunst. He's based

15:26.220 --> 15:28.268
in San Francisco.
The prototype was

15:28.310 --> 15:31.097
reported missing at 2:30 am.
and yet here he is,

15:31.140 --> 15:33.188
in Chicago,
bright and early.

15:33.230 --> 15:34.618
LUCCA:
How'd he get here so fast?

15:34.670 --> 15:35.967
Neil Gross' private plane.[phone dings]

15:36.020 --> 15:37.829
That is interesting.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.494
Diane needs you
back at the office.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.973
Why?

15:41.020 --> 15:42.362
I don't know.
Go, I've got this.

15:42.410 --> 15:43.718
All rise

15:43.760 --> 15:45.546
for the Honorable
Judge Hal Ferris.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.986
Angry faces.

15:51.030 --> 15:52.588
Looks like fun.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.198
Fire away.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.592
Your Honor,

15:55.650 --> 15:57.424
my client was arrested
on the flimsiest of pretenses.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.335
Wait a minute.

15:59.390 --> 16:02.257
There's a trail

16:02.300 --> 16:04.086
of ants here, Harris.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.654
Have you been eating sandwiches
on my bench again?

16:05.700 --> 16:06.951
No, Your Honor.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.139
Can we do something about this?

16:09.180 --> 16:11.045
I'll get right on it.Good.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.001
Okay, uh, I'll stand
for this one.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.221
I'm a little grossed out.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.090
And I can't wait
to hear more, counselor.

16:18.150 --> 16:19.959
Yes, Your Honor.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.238
We request that
the US. Attorney show...

16:22.280 --> 16:24.532
Your Honor?

16:24.590 --> 16:26.717
Yes, I can listen to you

16:26.760 --> 16:28.159
and watch ants

16:28.200 --> 16:29.019
at the same time.

16:29.070 --> 16:30.935
We request that the AUSA

16:30.990 --> 16:32.935
show probable cause
or release him.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.982
Well, let's get to it, then.

16:36.030 --> 16:39.420
Mr. Gross contacted us
at 2:35 am.

16:39.470 --> 16:41.074
We then interviewed Blake Reedy,

16:45.220 --> 16:48.690
Mr. Reedy stated that
the device had been stolen

16:48.740 --> 16:52.085
from his backpack
at the Deviceroy after-party.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.869
We took it from there.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.649
There were over 15,000
people at the party.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.268
How did you
locate Mr. Howell?

16:57.320 --> 16:58.651
We worked the
guest list,

16:58.710 --> 17:00.223
cross-referenced it
With known offenders.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.963
We identified

17:02.020 --> 17:04.056
Mr. Howell,
then tracked down his tweet

17:04.110 --> 17:05.884
with his pictures of the Foil.

17:05.930 --> 17:08.239
Thanks, this is perfect.The Foil is
the stolen tablet, Your Honor.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.805
Uh-huh.

17:10.850 --> 17:14.240
The known offenders list--
why was Mr. Howell on it?

17:14.290 --> 17:16.542
Well, he's something
of a low-level hacker.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.079
Low-level?
I'm not low-level.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.294
Fanboy stuff, mostly.
Unveiling new

17:21.340 --> 17:23.558
game specs before they're
released.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.649
But he's also been
suspected of hacking

17:26.690 --> 17:28.863
law enforcement
databases.Objection,

17:28.910 --> 17:30.252
no foundation.Withdrawn.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.470
No more questions.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.215
Okay, next.Um, Agent Dunst,

17:33.260 --> 17:35.262
you're technically with the FBI

17:35.310 --> 17:37.221
but also serve on TAPS--

17:37.270 --> 17:40.091
the Technology Allied
Protection Service task force,

17:40.140 --> 17:42.096
is that correct?It is, although

17:42.140 --> 17:45.314
I would not call myself
technically with the FBI.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.180
Does the FBI_have _
a steering committee, Sir?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.401
A...Steering committee.

17:49.450 --> 17:51.236
No.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.158
Does the Secret Service
or the Chicago PD?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.065
Not that I know of.How about TAPS?

17:56.110 --> 17:58.328
Does they have
a steering committee?

17:58.380 --> 18:00.063
Yes, they do.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.156
And, um, who serves
on this committee?

18:02.210 --> 18:05.509
Law enforcement.
Experts in their fields.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.687
And...

18:07.730 --> 18:10.255
I'm not sure
what you want me to say.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.292
CEOs of Silicon Valley's
14 biggest companies--

18:13.350 --> 18:15.045
don't they serve on
the steering committee too?

18:15.090 --> 18:16.341
DUNST:
That's right.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.561
Including
Neil Gross?

18:17.610 --> 18:19.043
Objection.
Relevance.I am just

18:19.090 --> 18:20.261
trying to identify

18:20.310 --> 18:22.175
who Agent Dunst reports to.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.312
Your Honor, the TAPS
steering committee

18:24.360 --> 18:26.749
coordinates the protection
of the country's technology,

18:26.800 --> 18:29.143
_ which is_ _
a national security issue.

18:29.190 --> 18:32.273
And you know how much I love
my national security secure.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.710
Uh, I'm guessing that
the answer to Mrs. Florrick's

18:35.760 --> 18:39.150
question is, "Yes,

18:39.200 --> 18:40.929
I do report
to Neil Gross."

18:40.980 --> 18:43.244
That is correct.Well, then I've
heard the answer.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.336
Overruled.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.336
Did TAPS receive
a grant from Chumhum?

18:46.380 --> 18:47.335
Objection.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.336
Did your unit receive

18:49.380 --> 18:51.166
a grant from Chumhum, agent?

18:51.210 --> 18:52.290
Yes, Your Honor.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.217
So now I've heard
that answer too.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.989
Overruled.Agent Dunst,

18:56.040 --> 18:58.349
isn't it true
that last year alone,

18:58.390 --> 19:00.392
four agents from TAPS

19:00.440 --> 19:03.432
left for senior jobs at
Chumhum's security department?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.048
Objection. These questions
are irrelevant.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.704
Were there grounds
to arrest the defendant?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.739
That's the only question
that matters here.

19:07.790 --> 19:08.927
This is a massive

19:08.970 --> 19:10.870
conflict of interest,
Your Honor.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.409
TAPS is effectively acting

19:12.450 --> 19:14.793
as Mr. Gross'
personal security force.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.106
TAPS is a legitimate
law enforcement organization.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.718
Issues of conflict of interest

19:22.770 --> 19:25.933
are more appropriate
for trial, counselor.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.460
So_ for the moment the
is only question is:

19:29.510 --> 19:32.468
is there enough evidence
to hold your client?

19:32.510 --> 19:36.253
Oh, good, uh, Lucca, we
need you on the Dipple filing.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.768
Oh, I'm in the midst
of the Howell defense.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.216
Ithought
that was Alicia.It is.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.386
But it's-it's me too.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.359
Actually, we would rather
have you on the Dipple filing,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.527
if that's all right.
You can work with Monica.

19:49.570 --> 19:52.095
You'll love working with her.
She's fantastic.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.096
Monica...

19:54.140 --> 19:57.758
do you remember
Lucca?

19:57.800 --> 19:59.756
Yes. From the Safe Filter suit.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.404
Well, now
you're on the same side.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.973
Yes, now we are.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.328
Can you show Lucca
what we're doing?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.326
Sure can.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.541
So... I'm supposed
to really like you.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.161
Yes, let's share about
our common experiences.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.388
Blake Reedy,

20:19.430 --> 20:22.388
design engineer
on the Foil development team.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.829
I designed the home button...

20:23.870 --> 20:25.383
with Mr. Gross' input,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.476
of course.And you brought
the prototype

20:27.530 --> 20:29.395
with you
to the Deviceroy conference?

20:29.440 --> 20:30.919
Yeah. I'd work on it
during breaks.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.268
And how can you
be sure

20:32.310 --> 20:35.188
you didn't lose it
during one of those breaks?

20:35.230 --> 20:37.698
My backpack has a power
plug. When I'm not working

20:37.750 --> 20:39.832
on the device, it's always
plugged in there, charging.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.700
And did you take the tablet out
during the after-party?

20:42.760 --> 20:44.455
No, it was in my bag
the whole time.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.752
But I remember that guy

20:46.810 --> 20:48.414
bumping into me
by the martini bar.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.325
Mr. Howell,
the defendant?Yeah.

20:50.370 --> 20:53.589
And when I got back to my
hotel room 20 minutes later,

20:53.640 --> 20:57.076
I saw the Foil was gone.Thank you.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.769
Uh, so you never took the device
out of your backpack?

20:58.820 --> 21:01.641
I was like a Secret Service guy
carrying the football.

21:01.690 --> 21:03.169
[chuckles softly]

21:03.210 --> 21:05.258
Um, this is from
the comments section

21:05.300 --> 21:07.518
of the tech blog Gadgy.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.822
Uh, a woman
named CandyCane posted

21:09.870 --> 21:12.657
about a "geek-hot engineer"
who showed her

21:12.700 --> 21:14.611
the Foil prototype
at the Deviceroy party.

21:14.660 --> 21:18.096
Was there another geek-hot
engineer with the prototype?Objection.

21:18.140 --> 21:22.884
Sustained. Harris,
where are we with the bug spray?

21:22.930 --> 21:24.488
Working on it,
Your Honor.

21:24.540 --> 21:25.928
Did you not show
this woman the Foil

21:25.980 --> 21:27.311
to impress her?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.099
I-I didn't let her
touch it or anything.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.015
But isn't it possible that

21:31.070 --> 21:32.719
you got distracted

21:32.760 --> 21:33.931
and just left it?Objection.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.288
Asked and answered.

21:35.330 --> 21:36.763
Sure. Sustained.

21:36.810 --> 21:38.334
Could you read
this text

21:38.380 --> 21:41.076
which is from your...
coworker?

21:42.690 --> 21:44.726
How did you...
how did you get this?

21:44.780 --> 21:48.341
From your coworker.Objection, your Honor.
What is this document?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.858
Uh, well, from what the
counselor just told us

21:50.910 --> 21:52.343
it seems to be
a text message.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.268
And from all appearances,
your witness

21:55.310 --> 21:57.744
recognizes it.
So what is the objection?

21:57.790 --> 21:59.746
Foundation.Sure. That's an objection.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.269
Overruled.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.787
ALICIA: Could you
read the text message?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.353
Um, "My bad.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.798
"Gotta tell NG.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.353
NG will kill me."

22:07.410 --> 22:08.832
NG being Neil Gross?

22:08.890 --> 22:10.369
Yeah.
Didn't you fabricate

22:10.410 --> 22:12.105
the whole theft story
because you were afraid

22:12.150 --> 22:13.492
NG might kill you?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.280
No.

22:15.330 --> 22:17.104
Then what does
that text refer to?

22:17.160 --> 22:20.596
It being stolen.So why is it "your bad"
if it was stolen?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.858
I don't know._ Because I was
being inexact in my language?

22:22.900 --> 22:24.458
Okay.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.468
When TAPS questioned you,
did Mr. Gross

22:27.520 --> 22:29.249
instruct them
what to ask you?

22:29.300 --> 22:32.167
GADES:
Objection. We've been over this.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.029
Yup. Yeah, you lost
this one earlier,

22:34.090 --> 22:35.648
Mrs. Florrick.
Sustained.

22:35.700 --> 22:38.168
Nothing further.

22:40.310 --> 22:41.743
I'm losing, aren't I?

22:41.790 --> 22:44.520
We have to shift gears.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.309
The Hard Core has protein,
almonds,

22:48.360 --> 22:50.316
turbinado and one hell
of an ice cream headache.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.531
E|__I:
Marissa!

22:51.580 --> 22:53.969
Dad.
I need you now!
Um...

22:54.020 --> 22:56.238
I'll be right back.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.158
What the hell?Did the Fed ask you any
questions about Alicia?

23:01.200 --> 23:03.543
No. I mentioned her,
and he asked what she was like,

23:03.590 --> 23:04.852
but I didn't say anything.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.414
He called again
and asked me out.
Who, Hlavin?

23:07.470 --> 23:09.165
Yeah. Just a few hours ago.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.599
I was thinking "no,"
but maybe I should say "yes."

23:11.650 --> 23:12.992
Is he after Alicia?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.600
I don't know.
Do you want me
to find out?

23:15.650 --> 23:17.083
You'll be careful?

23:17.130 --> 23:18.609
Always.

23:28.530 --> 23:30.578
Eli.
So the 27th floor again.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.531
Everything comes full
circle, doesn't it?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.536
Yes.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.970
First the tragedy,
and then the farce.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.578
You need something?

23:39.630 --> 23:41.234
We're good, yes?

23:41.280 --> 23:42.542
We're good.

23:42.590 --> 23:45.229
_I think Feds are
investigating you.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.679
And your chair is tilted.

23:49.810 --> 23:51.596
They're investigating me
for what?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.551
I don't know. I'm
trying to find out.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.295
It could be
the Judge Schakowsky bribe.

23:55.340 --> 23:56.591
I had nothing to do with that.

23:56.650 --> 23:58.254
Or the electoral
board vote. I need you

23:58.300 --> 24:00.256
to call me
if Roland Hlavin comes by.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.904
Him?
Mm-hmm.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.211
He approached Marissa.

24:03.260 --> 24:05.956
Oh, God. It never ends.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.480
Neil Gross is a fascist.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.351
And fascists must not be
allowed to terrorize.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.448
Mr. Dudewitz, hello.Hello,

24:13.490 --> 24:15.446
lawyer, other lawyer.

24:15.490 --> 24:16.798
I'm not a lawyer.Do I care?

24:16.840 --> 24:19.308
I am here, as requested,
to stand up to the bully.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.531
I'll be in touch.
Yup.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.535
Here's the Howell
file, Alicia.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.546
Where are you going?

24:25.590 --> 24:29.151
Me? Upstairs,
on another case.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.668
What other case?
There's no other case. I'm here.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.209
This is the case.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.729
LUCCA:
Diane has me on Dipple.

24:34.770 --> 24:37.330
Stay. I'll talk to Diane.

24:37.380 --> 24:39.769
Great. Now what do you want?

24:39.820 --> 24:42.038
We want
what you know about the Foil.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.684
It's a marketing stunt.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.514
LUCCA:
What part of it, Mr. Dudewitz?

24:45.570 --> 24:48.209
All of it. The lost device,
the arrest of that guy there.

24:48.260 --> 24:51.525
The... The... Aren't
you supposed to be

24:51.570 --> 24:53.049
sitting up there?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.397
Yes, but it's opposite day.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.351
See? No gavel, either.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.049
LUCCA:
Uh, please continue,
Mr. Dudewitz.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.351
What's your name again?

24:59.410 --> 25:01.310
Lucca.I love that name.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.146
How'd you get that name?GADES:
Objection, Your Honor.

25:03.190 --> 25:06.842
Relevance.
I know, but yet,
I'm... I'm curious, too.

25:06.890 --> 25:09.324
Uh, you may answer.

25:09.370 --> 25:10.849
My parents traveled a lot.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.800
I was this close
to being called "Budapest."

25:12.850 --> 25:15.853
Budapest. That's funny.
What was the question again?

25:15.900 --> 25:18.721
You were saying, um,
this is a marketing stunt.

25:18.770 --> 25:21.944
Yes. The lost Foil,
this proceeding.

25:21.990 --> 25:24.811
It's a piece of theatre. No,
it's a piece of tragic-comedy

25:24.870 --> 25:26.349
conjured up by Neil Gross,

25:26.390 --> 25:28.824
the great carnival
barker of our time.

25:28.870 --> 25:31.475
Objection. Relevance.LUCCA:
Your Honor, if this is

25:31.530 --> 25:33.953
indeed a marketing stunt,
then there is no crime,

25:34.010 --> 25:35.875
which would mean
no probable cause.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.524
I'll hear it out. Overruled.LUCCA:
What specifically

25:37.570 --> 25:40.312
makes you think this
is a marketing stunt?

25:40.360 --> 25:42.351
We talked about the same thing
with our first product launch.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.709
Mr. Gross-- and I use
"mister" guardedly--

25:45.760 --> 25:47.569
he's about to launch
his first foray

25:47.630 --> 25:49.143
into personal computing devices

25:49.190 --> 25:51.715
where products die
bloody, violent deaths.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.409
He's invested
$800 million.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.508
Why would he let a
prototype off his premises?

25:55.550 --> 25:57.586
So Chumhum's security lapse
was intended?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.289
Objection. Speculation.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.468
Let me hear a bit more,
then I'll rule.

26:02.510 --> 26:03.727
DUDEWITZ:
Chumhum's security

26:03.770 --> 26:05.465
is legendary.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.772
That compound is more fortified
than a missile silo in Kansas.

26:07.820 --> 26:11.085
So why leak the prototype?The Foil's a great
product. Kudos, Neil.

26:11.130 --> 26:13.598
At least you have the smarts
to hire people smarter than you,

26:13.650 --> 26:15.049
which actually isn't
that difficult.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.046
Anthony...

26:17.090 --> 26:19.399
It's the umpteenth tablet
in the market.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.396
It has a closed
operating system.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.657
Nobody's building apps for it.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.792
Bottom line: nobody cares.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.796
LUCCA:
So the arrest of
Mr. Howell boosts

26:26.840 --> 26:28.569
its profile
by generating publicity?

26:28.630 --> 26:30.973
It does.
Neil Gross is a jackass,

26:31.020 --> 26:32.271
but he's no dummy.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.844
Thank you, Mr. Dudewitz.

26:33.890 --> 26:36.848
Anytime. For you.

26:36.890 --> 26:40.189
Now I have to deal with
mediocrity, yes? This lady.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.377
Just a few questions,
Mr. Dudewitz.

26:42.420 --> 26:45.241
Sure. I can't wait.How do you beat
the retina scan

26:45.290 --> 26:46.985
at Chumhum's labs?I have no idea.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.292
That's because there is
no retina scan at Chumhum.

26:49.340 --> 26:52.468
Ah, you got me.
I'm red-faced.

26:52.520 --> 26:56.308
You have no idea of the security
measures at Chumhum, do you?

26:56.350 --> 27:00.389
I don't. I'm as innocent
as a suckling babe.You and Mr. Gross

27:00.440 --> 27:03.307
started out together at
Freemont Labs, correct?Yes, that's where

27:03.360 --> 27:05.612
Neil tried to write code...
with his own feces.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.309
And you still subscribe to

27:07.360 --> 27:08.748
the Research Labs' philosophy

27:08.800 --> 27:10.404
that technology should be shared

27:10.450 --> 27:12.577
and not sold
for profit, correct?

27:12.630 --> 27:14.313
You told her to go
down that road, Neil?

27:14.370 --> 27:16.588
Mr. Dudewitz...
Did you also
tell her about

27:16.630 --> 27:18.882
how you created
the code for Chumhum

27:18.940 --> 27:21.579
after our visit to the
Freemont Research Labs?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.325
Perhaps we can get
that in the record.
FERRIS:
Mr. Dudewitz,

27:24.380 --> 27:26.507
you are to answer
the attorney's questions.

27:26.550 --> 27:29.815
Do not address anyone else
in the court.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.248
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.461
No further questions.Excuse me?

27:33.520 --> 27:35.329
GADES:
We're done here.
No more questions.

27:35.390 --> 27:37.255
What just happened?

27:37.300 --> 27:39.348
I think we just landed
a sucker punch.

27:39.390 --> 27:40.914
[chatter, phones ringing]

27:40.960 --> 27:42.518
Hello?

27:42.570 --> 27:45.175
Who have you been talking to,
Eli Gold?

27:45.220 --> 27:47.006
Ruth.

27:47.050 --> 27:48.529
I thought you'd
been sucked up

27:48.570 --> 27:50.526
into all those snow
belt governors' races.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.617
I've kept busy.
So, to what do
I owe this honor?

27:53.670 --> 27:57.401
Oh, not so much an honor
as a bad feeling.

27:57.450 --> 27:59.236
Where'd you get that painting?

27:59.280 --> 28:01.714
Courtney Paige.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.149
It makes me nervous.
All those people staring,

28:04.200 --> 28:06.156
like they want something.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.633
I think it's about revolution.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.240
Are you sure?
They seem to be singing.

28:10.290 --> 28:13.339
And thé’ﬁe. trees.
Well, you know. Art.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.507
Are you out to get me, Eli?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.334
Am I... out to get you?

28:17.390 --> 28:19.164
No. Why? Should I be?

28:19.210 --> 28:20.518
You seem to have waited
until I was good and gone

28:20.560 --> 28:21.959
to get a little revenge.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.388
What are you babbling about?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.954
Grand jury subpoena...
from the FBI.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.176
Well, I'm sure
it's just a standard

28:30.230 --> 28:32.300
post-campaign wind-down.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.521
You know, checking
we clotted our Is and

28:34.580 --> 28:36.662
crossed our Ts.I've done that drill
more than once,

28:36.710 --> 28:40.623
and it does not include
an FBI interrogation.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.581
Well, my advice is,
don't make too much of it.

28:42.630 --> 28:44.586
Eli, if you're
setting me up here,

28:44.630 --> 28:46.279
I will take your
skinny little head...

28:46.330 --> 28:47.718
I am not setting you up.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.678
that you are in jeopardy,
I will let you know.

28:54.510 --> 28:56.944
We may be mercenaries, but...

28:56.990 --> 29:00.164
even mercenaries have a code.

29:00.210 --> 29:03.862
[hits envelope]When this thing's over...

29:03.910 --> 29:05.514
It's over.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.643
I promise.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.482
[phone ringing]

29:13.530 --> 29:15.395
_ You do realize
your timing chronically sucks.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.486
I need you
to do something for me.

29:16.530 --> 29:17.656
Now? The store is packed.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.007
Well, tell them to buy

29:19.060 --> 29:21.221
juice at 7-11
like normal people!

29:21.280 --> 29:22.963
I need you
to call your friend Roland

29:23.020 --> 29:24.442
or Scott,
or whatever his name is.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.717
What? Why?

29:25.760 --> 29:27.978
I need you
to set up another date.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.625
[sighs]

29:30.680 --> 29:32.580
Hey, where's Lucca?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.676
I don't know.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.244
Wasn't she here helping you?

29:36.290 --> 29:38.110
I think they needed
her on another case.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.639
Here she is.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.500
Oh, Lu... What?

29:42.560 --> 29:44.687
MAN:
No, right there...Excuse me.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.209
What's going on?

29:46.260 --> 29:47.818
We have a warrant authorizing
the search of these premises

29:47.870 --> 29:49.690
for the missing
Foil prototype.

29:49.740 --> 29:51.867
Ah, wait. Hold on. We're
Mr. Howell's attorneys.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.434
Anything you find
here is work product,

29:54.480 --> 29:56.004
and, therefore, privileged.

29:56.050 --> 29:57.870
This also happens
to be Howell's place of work,

29:57.920 --> 29:59.649
so, yes, we're
authorized.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.668
Mr. Howell's cubicle is_
downstairs. Your search Will be

30:02.710 --> 30:05.053
confined to his work space and
will be supervised by one of us.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.658
No ma'am.
As IT specialist,

30:06.710 --> 30:08.234
he has access to every

30:08.280 --> 30:10.054
cubicle and office
on the premises,

30:10.110 --> 30:12.010
so we'll search where we like.
Excuse me.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.322
[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

30:16.550 --> 30:19.508
They won't find anything.How can you be sure?

30:20.900 --> 30:23.505
Because I have it.

30:29.130 --> 30:31.121
DIANE:
You were told multiple times
the firm would have nothing

30:31.170 --> 30:33.297
to do with this device.I didn't take it
to help broker a sale.

30:33.350 --> 30:34.863
It all happened in the moment.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.603
When they arrested him,

30:36.660 --> 30:39.618
Howell panicked and stashed it
in my cubicle.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.434
They're losing
the probable cause hearing.

30:41.490 --> 30:44.095
This is their pushback.We should give them
their device.

30:44.140 --> 30:48.053
We can't do that. It's bound up
in attorney-client privilege.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.497
[sighs]

30:50.540 --> 30:52.314
We should talk.

30:52.370 --> 30:57.012
Alicia, do you
have a minute?

30:57.070 --> 31:01.586
So, we have to find a
working rhythm here again.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.507
I know. The Howell case
got a bit out of hand.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.891
No, it's bigger than that.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.202
Okay.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.298
When Cary suggested

31:12.340 --> 31:15.218
that you come back,
I wasn't against it,

31:15.260 --> 31:18.912
but I was afraid
that there might be a few bumps.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.656
Which bumps might those be?

31:21.700 --> 31:24.134
A certain independence

31:24.180 --> 31:26.171
and a resistance to oversight.

31:26.230 --> 31:29.313
Okay.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.921
Tell me how you would like me
to improve.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.010
Lucca isn't your associate.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.142
She is the firm's associate.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.156
I understand.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.930
She caught the Howell case
with me, so I thought

31:43.980 --> 31:46.676
the associate that caught
the case stays with the case.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.334
Sometimes.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.029
If the partners agree.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.947
I see. I'm sorry.

31:52.990 --> 31:55.595
I should have checked with you
first. Anything else?

31:57.910 --> 32:01.437
Lucca needs to know that
she is answerable to the firm,

32:01.480 --> 32:02.959
and not just to you.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.002
And that's why
you have her on the Dipple case?

32:05.050 --> 32:07.951
No. I have her
on the Dipple case

32:08.010 --> 32:10.968
because we needed an associate
on the Dipple case.

32:13.230 --> 32:15.744
Diane,

32:15.800 --> 32:17.665
I'm thrilled to be back.

32:17.710 --> 32:19.849
I want to be of service.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.539
But I also return with

32:21.590 --> 32:23.842
some cases, clients
and knowledge.

32:23.890 --> 32:25.892
You mean, in bond court?

32:26.900 --> 32:28.845
Yes,

32:28.900 --> 32:31.243
I do mean in bond court.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.201
Lucca is good.

32:33.250 --> 32:36.242
She's smart
and forward-leaning

32:36.300 --> 32:38.598
and a prodigy.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.993
And with respect,

32:41.040 --> 32:43.167
she shouldn't be given
grunt work.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.823
Your advice is welcome.

32:46.870 --> 32:48.690
The partners will consider it.

32:48.740 --> 32:50.617
Thank you.

32:50.660 --> 32:54.005
Anything else?

32:54.050 --> 32:55.961
No, you can go.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.452
Hypothetical, Mr. Gross.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.936
Suppose I knew where
the Foil prototype was.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.719
Melodramatic opening,

33:13.770 --> 33:15.419
but I'm listening.

33:15.470 --> 33:19.201
IfI could convince
my client to return it,

33:19.250 --> 33:21.559
would you convince TAPS
to drop the charges?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.033
I would on the condition

33:23.080 --> 33:25.469
that he also tell me_
exactly how he got it.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.829
No.Then we have nothing to
hypothetically negotiate.

33:27.870 --> 33:29.997
Dudewitz is right about you.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.779
You think
you're so indispensable

33:31.830 --> 33:34.048
to the fabric
of modern society

33:34.090 --> 33:35.648
that you've even bought
your own a police force

33:35.700 --> 33:37.873
to do your dirty work
under color of law.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.002
Goliath stomping David, right?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.836
You know what these TAPS agents
are, Mrs. Florrick?

33:42.890 --> 33:45.450
They are heroes.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.627
Really?

33:47.670 --> 33:49.809
And why is that, Mr. Gross?

33:49.850 --> 33:52.808
Because the Goliaths
are the new Davids.

33:52.850 --> 33:55.501
The model of scruffy kids
toiling in a garage

33:55.550 --> 33:56.983
is a quaint anachronism.

33:57.030 --> 34:02.718
This isn't 1953, 1973
or even 2003.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.590
The great innovations today

34:04.650 --> 34:06.868
are coming out of corporate
labs, not garages.

34:06.910 --> 34:09.083
Everyone thinks Goliath
is the villain,

34:09.130 --> 34:11.382
but the truth is that today,

34:11.440 --> 34:13.783
more often than not,
he is a victim.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.525
And he needs protection.

34:15.570 --> 34:18.084
Objection. Relevance, not to
mention self-aggrandizing.

34:18.140 --> 34:21.576
Let's get back
to probable cause, Ms. Gades.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.611
Uh, Harris...

34:23.670 --> 34:25.001
they're back.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.755
I have another call in,
Your Honor.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.576
Well, they seem
to be getting bigger.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.847
Your Honor, may I continue?

34:30.890 --> 34:32.881
Go for it.Was the leak of the Foil

34:32.940 --> 34:35.807
a marketing stunt,
as Anthony Dudewitz alleges?

34:35.850 --> 34:39.718
Hmm. Anthony's currency
is, um, conspiracy theories.

34:39.770 --> 34:42.591
They make for fun segments
on Discovery Channel,

34:42.640 --> 34:44.289
but they don't comport
with reality.

34:44.340 --> 34:46.808
No. No, this was not
a marketing stunt.

34:46.860 --> 34:48.293
GADES:
But this incident has garnered

34:48.340 --> 34:49.989
publicity for the Foil,
has it not?

34:50.040 --> 34:51.291
I can generate
publicity

34:51.350 --> 34:52.772
in a million different ways.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.731
I'm a carnival barker,
remember?

34:54.780 --> 34:56.566
No, I would never
leak the Foil

34:56.610 --> 34:58.396
for one simple reason:

34:58.440 --> 35:00.396
I don't launch
defective products.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.136
What is he talking about?I don't know.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.784
GADES:
Are you saying the
product is defective?

35:04.840 --> 35:06.831
Yes, in its current state.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.314
The... the swipe function
has a rebound effect.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.534
It's barely visible, but it's
enough to keep me up at night.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.140
And even Anthony Dudewitz
can tell you,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.452
I would never use a stunt
to leak a product

35:17.500 --> 35:19.229
that is not perfect.

35:19.290 --> 35:20.769
Thank you, sir.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.892
ALICIA: Mr. Gross...FERRIS:
That's okay, Mrs. Florrick.

35:22.940 --> 35:24.931
I've heard enough.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.469
What? I'd like to cross.

35:26.510 --> 35:27.761
Mr. Gross has convinced me

35:27.820 --> 35:29.720
that this wasn't
a marketing stunt.

35:29.770 --> 35:31.852
Uh, there.

35:31.910 --> 35:33.559
I saved you your cross.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.774
Your Honor...This is a preliminary hearing,
Mrs. Florrick,

35:36.830 --> 35:37.865
not a trial.

35:37.910 --> 35:39.514
You can revisit it then

35:39.570 --> 35:42.789
if you can't come up
with something better.

35:42.830 --> 35:46.527
I'm entering a finding
of probable cause.

35:46.570 --> 35:48.879
We'll set trial
for six months from now.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.968
[low chatter,
music playing in background]

35:57.850 --> 35:59.750
You're wasting your time
with Ruth Eastman.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.199
Am I now?

36:01.240 --> 36:02.935
I've worked with dozens
of political operatives,

36:02.980 --> 36:06.063
and Ruth is as upstanding
as they come.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.371
I'm surprised.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.899
That Ruth's legit?

36:08.940 --> 36:10.419
No. That you'd defend her

36:10.470 --> 36:12.244
after she pushed you out
of Governor Florrick's campaign.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.427
Well, you know.

36:14.470 --> 36:15.858
Bygones.

36:15.910 --> 36:18.208
Hmm. From what I heard,
that wound up putting you

36:18.260 --> 36:19.909
on the outs
with the entire Florrick family.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.778
What do you want to know,

36:22.830 --> 36:24.821
Agent Hlavin

36:24.870 --> 36:27.338
or Devereaux? Hmm?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.561
Instead of poking around
with Ruth Eastman

36:29.620 --> 36:31.963
and God knows who else,
why don't you just ask me?

36:32.010 --> 36:35.400
What do you want?You'll find out soon enough.

36:35.450 --> 36:36.963
There's a limit to how long
you can play this game

36:37.020 --> 36:38.829
before investigation

36:38.890 --> 36:40.107
turns into intimidation.

36:40.150 --> 36:42.368
Are you threatening me?

36:42.410 --> 36:43.934
No, never.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.843
Just observing.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.197
Be careful, Eli.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.889
I have the full resources
of the FBI

36:49.940 --> 36:52.283
and the Justice Department
behind me on this,

36:52.340 --> 36:54.945
and we always get
what we're after.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.593
JASON:
Hey.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.129
I heard about the hearing.
I'm sorry.

37:01.170 --> 37:04.219
Yeah, looks like we're headed
towards a summer trial.

37:04.260 --> 37:06.512
Well, on the upside, Howell
can at least make bail.

37:06.570 --> 37:08.913
He doesn't have $250,000.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.211
He will now.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.170
That tech blog site, Gadgy,

37:12.230 --> 37:15.176
just upped their
bid to $250,000.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.053
Alicia?

37:21.450 --> 37:24.101
Please tell me you haven't
been negotiating with Gadgy.

37:24.150 --> 37:27.233
I'm sorry, I haven't what?

37:27.280 --> 37:30.101
Gadgy just offered
Howell $250,000,

37:30.160 --> 37:32.105
which means someone
has been talking to them,

37:32.160 --> 37:35.118
and it sure as hell
couldn't have been him.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.946
And you think it was me?

37:36.990 --> 37:39.117
Well, you've been hell-bent
on proving Cary and Diane wrong.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.038
You can't dig in on principle
at a firm like this.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.423
I know that coming here
wasn't your first choice--

37:44.470 --> 37:46.028
believe me, it wasn't mine--

37:46.080 --> 37:48.128
but our hand was forced.

37:48.170 --> 37:50.821
I think I found
your guilty party.

37:50.870 --> 37:52.599
Or more accurately,

37:52.660 --> 37:56.221
419,000 guilty parties.

38:01.970 --> 38:03.881
ALICIA:
Wait a minute.

38:03.930 --> 38:05.625
With all those followers,

38:05.670 --> 38:07.444
I think there's
another way to go.

38:10.370 --> 38:11.678
ELI:
It's Peter.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.971
You sure?

38:13.020 --> 38:14.362
They don't bring
the full resources of the FBI

38:14.420 --> 38:17.457
andthe Justice Department
against just anyone.

38:17.510 --> 38:20.070
They're trying to bring down
another governor.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.462
Which issue specifically?

38:21.510 --> 38:23.501
I don't know.

38:24.910 --> 38:26.855
You know what it's like.

38:26.910 --> 38:29.253
The longer you're in office,
the more things there are

38:29.300 --> 38:33.088
that are papered over,
put away,

38:33.130 --> 38:35.439
massaged.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.436
Yes, but in my experience,

38:37.480 --> 38:39.869
if you think back through
all of the issues

38:39.920 --> 38:42.912
and figure which one
you never kept a file on,

38:42.970 --> 38:45.962
never took a note about,
never admitted to anyone...

38:46.010 --> 38:47.887
that's the one.

38:47.930 --> 38:50.979
You know...

38:51.020 --> 38:54.103
you were right.

38:54.150 --> 38:56.289
'Bout what?Returning home after losing

38:56.330 --> 38:58.844
a presidential bid, Peter had
a target on his back...

39:01.250 --> 39:03.764
...and someone's going
to take a shot at him.

39:03.810 --> 39:06.074
Every time.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.254
Good luck, Eli.

39:13.430 --> 39:16.308
[door opens]

39:16.350 --> 39:17.339
[door closes][sighs]

39:22.880 --> 39:24.836
All rise!

39:27.880 --> 39:30.405
[plastic crinkling]

39:34.760 --> 39:37.490
So Christo seems to
have been at work here.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.098
No.

39:39.150 --> 39:40.936
Pete from Maintenance.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.322
Ah.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.768
So he didn't want
to tent me, too?

39:43.810 --> 39:45.414
No. He thinks this will do it.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.767
Great.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.368
Well.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.332
It's a real improvement here.

39:51.380 --> 39:55.032
So, we seem to have
a new defense here

39:55.080 --> 39:56.342
we're trying, counselor?

39:56.390 --> 39:57.607
Well, not new.

39:57.650 --> 39:58.821
But true.

39:58.870 --> 39:59.905
Mr. Howell is a journalist.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.734
Really?!

40:01.790 --> 40:04.008
When did this happen?A citizen journalist.

40:04.050 --> 40:06.393
Mr. Howell is therefore entitled
to protect the identity

40:06.440 --> 40:08.704
of the person
from whom he obtained the Foil

40:11.010 --> 40:12.443
Mr. Howell is not a journalist.

40:12.490 --> 40:13.923
He's a look-at-me
With a smartphone.

40:13.970 --> 40:15.494
His tweet about the Foil

40:15.540 --> 40:17.792
falls within the definition
of journalism.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.933
He shared information
in a public forum,

40:20.980 --> 40:23.016
information he analyzed...

40:23.070 --> 40:24.412
With five exclamation points?

40:24.460 --> 40:26.325
That does not qualify
as analysis.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.029
And his post
sparked public debate

40:28.070 --> 40:30.459
about Whether the Foil
would succeed or fail.

40:30.510 --> 40:33.729
This so-called debate includes
an emoji of a flaming poop.

40:33.770 --> 40:35.419
Well, it's not as though
he tweeted a picture

40:35.470 --> 40:36.778
of his johnson, Ms. Gades.

40:36.820 --> 40:41.473
There's public interest
in the Foil,

40:41.520 --> 40:46.298
and his tweets added
to the public discourse,

40:46.350 --> 40:48.398
uh, flaming poops
notwithstanding.

40:48.440 --> 40:54.003
This court therefore considers
the defendant...

40:54.060 --> 40:55.960
a journalist.

40:56.010 --> 40:59.491
Go free and go crazy,
Mr. Howell.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.974
[bangs gavel]

41:02.020 --> 41:04.534
[laughing]

41:07.550 --> 41:09.359
The journalism angle
you came up with was a home run.

41:09.420 --> 41:11.115
Nice job.
Thank you.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.412
Now I need you
on something else.

41:13.470 --> 41:15.370
What?

41:20.340 --> 41:22.126
So here we are.

41:22.170 --> 41:24.866
Yep.

41:24.910 --> 41:26.992
Do you know any spirituals?

41:27.040 --> 41:28.382
[laughs softly]

41:29.700 --> 41:31.656
Ruth?

41:31.700 --> 41:34.134
What a nice surprise.

41:34.180 --> 41:36.705
I was in town,
figured I'd bring you

41:36.750 --> 41:38.354
a little office-warming present.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.311
El Audaz.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.577
It means "the bold."

41:41.620 --> 41:43.406
That strong, huh?

41:43.450 --> 41:45.406
You'll see.

41:45.450 --> 41:49.147
Well, there is no time
like the present.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.144
Rough day?

41:50.200 --> 41:51.542
It was a bumpy reentry.

41:51.590 --> 41:52.841
Yes, I was surprised.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.368
I thought you reveled
in your independence.

41:55.420 --> 41:59.333
Big decisions are easy
When you have no other options.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.382
[grunts, clears throat]

42:04.430 --> 42:05.818
Oh, you weren't kidding.

42:05.870 --> 42:07.292
[whoops]

42:07.350 --> 42:09.511
Never about tequila.[laughs]

42:09.570 --> 42:12.528
So, What are you up to now?

42:12.570 --> 42:14.526
Couple governor races.

42:14.570 --> 42:17.084
But coming off a presidential,
these statewides seem so simple.

42:17.140 --> 42:18.789
I bet.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.650
Mrs. Florrick, I don't want
you to get too comfortable.

42:21.710 --> 42:23.792
You... What do you mean?

42:23.840 --> 42:26.149
Your husband has a target
on his back.

42:26.190 --> 42:29.444
Well, anyone
in public life does.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.843
No, but not like this.

42:31.890 --> 42:33.881
No question Peter
loves you,

42:33.940 --> 42:35.498
but he can hurt you.

42:35.550 --> 42:37.586
Drag you down.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.801
Not only destroy
everything you've done,

42:39.860 --> 42:41.942
but everything you want to do.

42:41.990 --> 42:45.209
Cash out while
you still can.
