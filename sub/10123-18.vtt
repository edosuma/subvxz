18:26.767 --> 18:28.100
YOU LOSE.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.500
AHEM. UH, YOUR CAR
GOT TOWED AWAY.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.900
YOU ARE THE WORST BABYSITTER
THAT EVER LIVED.

18:36.900 --> 18:41.300
AND YOUR CHILDREN
ARE THE SPAWN OF SATAN.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.200
HONEY, I THINK
YOU SHOULD STAY CALM.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.000
I AM CALM.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.400
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
I'M THE DALAI
STINKING LAMA.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.133
ERIC,
WHERE IS THE CAR?

18:51.133 --> 18:52.133
IT'S AT THE IMPOUND STATION.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.000
I HAVE THE 40 BUCKS
TO BAIL IT OUT.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.867
GREAT, BUT I'LL HAVE
TO DRIVE YOU DOWN THERE

18:55.867 --> 18:56.900
SO WE CAN GET IT HOME.

18:56.900 --> 18:57.900
ACTUALLY,

18:57.900 --> 18:59.500
YOU BOTH WILL HAVE
TO DRIVE HIM.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.667
WHY?

19:00.667 --> 19:01.967
WELL, BECAUSE ONE OF YOU

19:01.967 --> 19:03.567
IS GONNA HAVE TO DRIVE
MOM'S CAR BACK,

19:03.567 --> 19:06.100
AND ONE OF YOU IS GONNA
HAVE TO DRIVE YOUR CAR BACK.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.300
WHY?

19:07.300 --> 19:11.467
HE HASN'T GOT
A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.000
WELL...

19:13.000 --> 19:15.500
MY WORK IS DONE.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.400
I'LL JUST LEAVE.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.734
TIP?

19:19.734 --> 19:20.734
NO?

19:20.734 --> 19:22.500
WELL, THEN,
ALL RIGHT.

19:23.967 --> 19:25.133
I, UH...

19:25.133 --> 19:27.967
I SORT OF FAILED
MY DRIVING TEST.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.934
BUT YOU STILL
DECIDED TO...

19:30.934 --> 19:32.600
SORT OF
DRIVE MY CAR...

19:32.600 --> 19:33.734
WITHOUT A LICENSE.

19:33.734 --> 19:36.300
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET YOUR LICENSE.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.367
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO TAKE IT AWAY.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.967
YOU ARE GONNA BE
A PEDESTRIAN

19:39.967 --> 19:41.300
FOR LIFE, PAL.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.467
GO TO YOUR ROOM, ERIC.

19:42.467 --> 19:43.934
NO, I'M NOT FINISHED
WITH HIM YET.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.000
I HAVEN'T STARTED
WITH HIM YET.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.100
BUT I WANT TO TALK
WITH YOU NOW.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.133
IS MY AUTHORITY
BEING UNDERMINED?

19:49.133 --> 19:51.400
WOULD I DO THAT
IN FRONT OF YOUR SON?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.667
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

19:57.567 --> 19:58.734
NO GOOD.

19:58.734 --> 19:59.800
WHAT, NO GOOD?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.100
WHO DRIVES MORGAN
TO GYM CLASS?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.500
WHO DRIVES CORY
TO LITTLE LEAGUE?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.100
WHO DRIVES ERIC
ON A TRISTATE SEARCH

20:04.100 --> 20:06.300
FOR THE PERFECT
FLANNEL SHIRT? ME.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.834
I TAKE THESE KIDS
EVERYWHERE.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.100
I HELP...

20:11.567 --> 20:13.934
WHEN I CAN.

20:13.934 --> 20:15.400
I MEAN WELL.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.700
I WANT ERIC
TO GET HIS LICENSE.

20:19.700 --> 20:23.800
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS FOR 16 YEARS.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.734
SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PUNISH HIM?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.200
LOOK, ERIC SEES DRIVING

20:27.200 --> 20:29.967
AS NOTHING BUT DATES
WITH CHEERLEADERS,

20:29.967 --> 20:31.600
OPEN ROAD,
UNLIMITED FREEDOM.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.133
BUT I AM SEEING
HIS DRIVING

20:33.133 --> 20:35.834
AS TRIPS TO THE DRY CLEANERS
AND THE SUPERMARKET

20:35.834 --> 20:37.734
AND TAKING
HIS BROTHER AND SISTER

20:37.734 --> 20:39.567
WHEREVER THEY WANT TO GO.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.867
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
TRIED TO SCAM THEM.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.834
CRIME DOESN'T PAY.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.000
VIOLENCE IS BAD.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.967
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME.

20:49.967 --> 20:52.400
COR, JUST BE HAPPY
IT WAS A BABY SCAM.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.100
MINE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WAS A MEGASCAM,

20:55.100 --> 20:57.367
A HYPERSCAM,
THE MOTHER OF ALL SCAMS.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.700
I AM TRULY A DEAD MAN.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
THESE COULD BE
OUR LAST FEW

21:01.700 --> 21:03.567
PRECIOUS MOMENTS
TOGETHER.

21:03.567 --> 21:06.033
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.233
YEAH.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.100
HERE'S A LOVELY
PARTING GIFT.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.033
OOH!

21:17.033 --> 21:18.867
CORY...
ERIC...

21:18.867 --> 21:21.667
DAD...
MOM...

21:21.667 --> 21:23.800
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.800
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.033
THIS IS THE SENTENCING PHASE
OF THE PROCEEDINGS.

21:30.033 --> 21:32.000
I'M THE OLDEST.
DO ME FIRST.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.700
BOTH OF YOU ARE
GROUNDED FOR 2 WEEKS.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.100
Both: AAH! 2 WEEKS?
GROUNDED?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.367
THAT'S HORRIBLE!

21:40.367 --> 21:42.300
THERE'S MORE.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.133
Both: THERE'S MORE.

21:44.133 --> 21:45.400
DURING THOSE 2 WEEKS,

21:45.400 --> 21:46.734
YOU WILL DO NOTHING
BUT STUDY

21:46.734 --> 21:48.834
THE PENNSYLVANIA
MOTOR VEHICLE HANDBOOK,

21:48.834 --> 21:51.467
AND YOU WILL PASS
YOUR DRIVER'S TEST.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.400
I'LL TRY.
YOU'LL PASS.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.834
I'LL PASS.

21:54.834 --> 21:57.033
AND WHAT WILL I DO
FOR 2 WEEKS?

21:57.033 --> 21:59.900
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO WATCH TV.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.000
COOL.

22:01.000 --> 22:01.967
EDUCATIONAL TV,

22:01.967 --> 22:03.500
AND NOTHING
BUT EDUCATIONAL TV

22:03.500 --> 22:05.467
STARTING RIGHT NOW.

22:05.467 --> 22:08.834
<i>Man on TV: THE CARIBOU </i>
<i>MARKS ITS TERRITORY </i>

22:08.834 --> 22:13.667
<i>BY DEFECATING </i>
<i>AND FLINGING ITS DUNG. </i>

22:13.667 --> 22:15.500
EWW!

22:23.967 --> 22:26.133
COME ON, I'LL BE LATE
FOR GYMNASTICS.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.467
ERIC, COME ON. LITTLE LEAGUE
STARTS IN 20 MINUTES,

22:28.467 --> 22:30.567
AND WE HAVE TO STOP
AT THE CLEANERS

22:30.567 --> 22:31.667
TO PICK UP MY UNIFORM.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.400
I WANT TO STOP
FOR FROZEN YOGURT.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.500
AND WE HAVE
TO PICK UP SHAWN

22:34.500 --> 22:36.400
AND WE HAVE TO STOP
AND GET PIZZA

22:36.400 --> 22:38.133
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE SNACK MOM.

22:38.133 --> 22:40.400
HOW SHALL I SPEND
MY AFTERNOON?

22:40.400 --> 22:43.133
SHOULD I READ MAGAZINES
AND THEN SOAK IN THE TUB,

22:43.133 --> 22:45.700
OR SHOULD I SOAK
AND THEN READ?

22:45.700 --> 22:47.667
SOAK AND READ,
READ AND SOAK.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.900
HI, HON.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.834
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

22:51.834 --> 22:53.000
AHH, BLISS.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.967
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
A SON WHO DRIVES.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.200
LITTLE LEAGUE!
FROZEN YOGURT!

22:57.200 --> 22:59.300
I'LL DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE,
I SWEAR I WILL.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.700
TAKE YOUR MOTHER'S CAR.
