WEBVTT

00:39.414 --> 00:44.252
<i>- In the end, I'm not sure</i>
<i>it matters so much,</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:45.879
<i>because either way,</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:51.301
<i>she's still uniquely,</i>
<i>defiantly Angelyne.</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:58.141
<i>And that's why we love her.</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:01.394
<i>And that's why we love her.</i>

01:03.146 --> 01:06.358
And that's why we love her.

01:06.399 --> 01:10.945
And that's why we love her.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.824
And that's why we love her.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.245
That's why we love her.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.250
My name is Max Allen,

01:24.292 --> 01:28.129
and I made a documentary
about Angelyne in 2012.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.924
Well, I shot one anyway.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.095
It did not go well.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.650
I wasn't the first person to
make a documentary on Angelyne,

01:48.692 --> 01:51.403
and I clearly wasn't the last--

01:51.444 --> 01:53.822
good luck with that--

01:53.863 --> 01:56.616
but as far as I know,
the only one who actually

01:56.658 --> 01:58.785
managed to complete
a documentary on Angelyne

01:58.827 --> 02:01.162
was this weird, short,
black-and-white one

02:01.204 --> 02:02.539
made in the mid-'90s.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.835
<i>- I joined the fan club</i>
<i>in April '88.</i>

02:06.876 --> 02:10.422
<i>Sweden is the second country</i>
<i>where she's big in Europe.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:12.757
<i>Uh, last Christmas,</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:14.801
<i>she sent me</i>
<i>a piece of her hair</i>

02:14.843 --> 02:17.095
<i>together with</i>
<i>a signed photograph</i>

02:17.137 --> 02:20.015
<i>that I put inside of a frame.</i>

02:20.056 --> 02:23.226
- You can find it online still.
It's on YouTube.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.853
- A lot of people have tried

02:24.894 --> 02:27.689
to capture Angelyne on film,
and they've failed.

02:27.731 --> 02:31.401
Max, he's just
one of many who tried.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.070
Look, look, it takes--
takes a lot of heat

02:34.112 --> 02:35.822
to create a gem.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.324
Not everyone
can handle that, right?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.079
It can burn you up.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.956
- Thanks for coming today.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.917
I know the theater isn't
the most traditional setting

02:47.959 --> 02:52.172
for an arbitration,
but I'm not a judge.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.716
This is not a court proceeding.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.136
The goal here is to cut down
on the he said, she said

02:58.178 --> 03:01.348
and get to the truth
so you can both move forward.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.184
Plus, there's a performance
of "A Lie of the Mind" tonight,

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
so we gotta be
out of here by 6:00.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.150
All right.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.571
We're here because
both parties claim the other

03:16.613 --> 03:18.656
violated the terms
of what they agreed to

03:18.698 --> 03:22.744
when they set out
to make this...student film.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.788
- It was never a student film.
- Wasn't it?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.957
- Now, that's a good example
of what led us here.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.251
- Well, I had just graduated
from USC,

03:30.293 --> 03:33.713
and my parents weren't exactly
thrilled with my job prospects.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.007
So I needed a project
that could prove to them

03:36.049 --> 03:39.469
I could really do this,
and I thought,

03:39.511 --> 03:43.056
"Hey, I'll make a real
documentary about Angelyne."

03:43.098 --> 03:45.266
I couldn't believe
that there wasn't one already.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.310
She was still at it.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.812
<i>She's still at it now.</i>

03:48.853 --> 03:51.564
<i>- So I have a white T-shirt.</i>
<i>I have a black T-shirt.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:53.108
<i>- She peaked in the '80s;</i>
<i>and the '90s hit,</i>

03:53.149 --> 03:55.610
<i>and she was doing</i>
<i>the same exact thing.</i>

03:55.652 --> 03:58.446
- The '90s were go, go, go.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.656
There was another wall.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.408
<i>All of the art shows.</i>

04:01.449 --> 04:02.992
<i>I got the key</i>
<i>to West Hollywood.</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:07.038
<i>I had my own magazine,</i>
<i>"Hot Pink," self-published.</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:10.834
I had more billboards
in the '90s than ever,

04:10.875 --> 04:14.004
and that's including
the one that blew up.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.973
There's nothing more powerful
than being on fire.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.101
In 2003, I even ran
for governor of California.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.811
It was a crazy time.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.986
- Meanwhile,
Paris Hilton was out there

04:38.028 --> 04:40.488
<i>making millions</i>
<i>doing Angelyne 2.0,</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:41.990
<i>and this was</i>
<i>before the Kardashians</i>

04:42.032 --> 04:42.866
<i>and their billions.</i>

04:42.907 --> 04:44.034
<i>The world was going digital,</i>

04:44.075 --> 04:45.827
<i>but Angelyne,</i>
<i>she stayed analog.</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:48.663
Then in the aughts,
even her billboards dried up.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.500
- I don't really care
if there are billboards of me

04:52.542 --> 04:55.587
because I know who I am.

04:55.628 --> 05:00.633
And I like the mystery
of being this pink thing

05:00.675 --> 05:03.595
on top of the world in a cloud.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.348
- And that's where she was at
when I met her.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.849
I just called her up,

05:07.891 --> 05:10.560
met her in her office
to discuss the terms.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.188
I had no interest
in looking into anything

05:13.229 --> 05:15.023
that she wasn't comfortable
with me looking into.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.733
I...

05:16.775 --> 05:20.862
I just told her to show me
whatever she wanted to show me.

05:20.904 --> 05:26.076
- This was Sunset and Fairfax,
Pico and La Brea.

05:26.117 --> 05:30.413
I hope your camera
is calibrated for pink.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.292
You'll want to get these, hmm?

05:34.334 --> 05:38.088
- Whoa. It's so smart
that you put the year first.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.220
- Uh, I'm a little OCDC.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.055
- Oh, sorry.

05:47.097 --> 05:51.142
I just--I would love
to get going on all these.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.229
- We are in the process
of digitizing the archives.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.563
It's a big to-do.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.150
There's always something
going on around here.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.741
- Oh, is that Harold Wallach?

06:06.783 --> 06:07.951
On the phone, you mentioned

06:07.992 --> 06:09.536
me sitting down
and talking with him?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.871
- I can arrange that.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.917
No. No, no, no.
You cannot film that.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.877
It's in a closet.
- Cool.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.088
That's the dress from
"Earth Girls Are Easy," right?

06:20.130 --> 06:21.756
1988?

06:21.798 --> 06:24.634
- Bonhams is sending somebody
to pick it up.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.721
It's gonna be in an exhibit
of Hollywood memorabilia.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.931
- Bonhams' auction house?

06:29.973 --> 06:33.143
You're selling it?
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.771
- Wow.
It must be hard to part with.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.318
- Have you heard
of symbiosis, Max?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.611
- Yeah.
- It means a harmony

06:43.653 --> 06:44.821
in the universe,

06:44.863 --> 06:48.241
a mutually propitious
working together.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.452
Like, if somebody throws
their garbage away

06:50.493 --> 06:53.246
and another person comes along
and uses it for something else.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.581
Or in the deep sea,

06:54.622 --> 06:57.834
when a crab carries
a sea urchin on its back,

06:57.876 --> 06:59.627
The crab gets
to hide from predators,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.379
and the sea urchin
gets a free ride.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.341
Symbiosis.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.552
- Well, your stuff is
certainly not garbage.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.179
- Who said garbage?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.097
What is he doing?
I didn't say garbage.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.352
- No, I just--
I meant that they're iconic.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.896
You're iconic.

07:17.937 --> 07:22.901
You are very smart, Maxi.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.737
You can talk to Rick about
getting access to the archives

07:25.779 --> 07:27.489
when he's back from vacation.

07:27.530 --> 07:32.243
- Some might say vacation,
some might say taking a break.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.953
It's very tough in Hollywood.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.998
It's very easy
to get in trouble.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.710
I just decided to go home
and take a rest.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.508
That's what I was doing
when Max approached Angelyne

07:46.549 --> 07:48.760
about doing a documentary.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.641
I should have been there.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.892
- When is Rick coming back?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.144
'Cause I would love to start
talking with him.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.730
- Soon. Soon.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.358
In the meantime,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.986
I've made you a list of people
who are ready to rock and roll.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.446
- Great.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.532
Ken Berger?
- My dentist.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.700
- Ariel?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.869
- My astrologist.
Very important.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.538
I should have her
do your chart.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.709
Oh, excuse you.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.168
Where are you going?

08:22.210 --> 08:25.839
Mm-mm, mm-mm,
you cannot be filming in there.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.674
That's a bathroom.
- No, it's okay.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.760
We'll shoot a bunch of footage,
and then we'll edit it down.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.762
- I'm trying to show you

08:32.804 --> 08:35.473
what I mean to people,
to this city.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.684
The essence.
The inspiration.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.561
That is the story.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.564
That's all the me
you need to see.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.732
Ooh.
- Yeah.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.066
Yeah, but I mean, eventually,

08:45.108 --> 08:48.695
I do get to interview you,
though, right?

08:48.737 --> 08:53.491
- After we discuss
compensation.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.243
- What?

08:55.285 --> 08:59.247
- Actors and writers get paid
for their talent, right?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.665
- Right.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.833
- The people that
you're interviewing

09:01.875 --> 09:05.295
are essentially your actors.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.797
Don't they deserve
a little gratuity?

09:07.839 --> 09:09.507
And as for me, I am the writer.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.719
I write my reality every day.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.220
- Yes, I know--

09:14.262 --> 09:18.892
- And you are the filmmaker.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.602
Right.
- Right.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.812
See? We're in sync already.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.523
This is the story
that is going to launch

09:25.565 --> 09:27.317
the rocket ship of your destiny

09:27.359 --> 09:29.944
as the great filmmaker
that you are,

09:29.986 --> 09:33.114
just like the billboard
launched mine.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.201
Say it.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.205
- Say what?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.375
- I am a great...

09:46.753 --> 09:48.254
- I am...

09:54.469 --> 09:58.139
- Be the thing, Maximillian.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.183
If you are a filmmaker,
then say you are.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.726
If you say you are,
then you are.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.729
Who is to say you're not?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.315
Go ahead.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.025
- Oh, you're waiting
for me to--

10:09.067 --> 10:11.611
- Mm-hmm.
I'm waiting.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.613
- Okay.
- I'm still waiting.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.491
Waiting.
- I'm a great filmmaker.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.247
I'm a great filmmaker.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.375
- Yes, you are.
There you go.

10:29.546 --> 10:34.342
- Okay. I guess I could
ask my parents for more money.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.188
<i>- In hindsight, the photo</i>
<i>should have been a warning.</i>

10:47.230 --> 10:50.525
<i>All of those men had left her.</i>

10:50.567 --> 10:54.029
<i>Rick seemed to be</i>
<i>on permanent vacation.</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:55.947
<i>Harold hadn't worked there</i>
<i>since the '90s.</i>

10:58.241 --> 11:02.037
<i>She wouldn't talk</i>
<i>about Freddy.</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:04.706
They were all gone.

11:04.748 --> 11:08.835
- Freddy, um...

11:11.379 --> 11:14.716
Freddy took
my first billboard photos.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.430
<i>Freddy stayed by my side.</i>

11:20.472 --> 11:24.476
<i>He truly believed in me</i>
<i>and my career.</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:28.229
<i>He knew I was only here</i>
<i>to do good in the world.</i>

11:28.271 --> 11:31.524
What would you do
to make Hollywood better?

11:31.566 --> 11:36.613
- The only thing I can think of
to make Hollywood better

11:36.654 --> 11:43.078
is for people to get along...

11:43.119 --> 11:49.125
and to be peaceful
and love one another.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.168
I know it sounds silly,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.003
but when people
love each other,

11:52.045 --> 11:57.592
they can overcome anything,

11:57.634 --> 12:00.428
even an act of God.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.681
- That's cool.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.393
Get up and walk to the ocean.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.647
<i>I don't like to say</i>
<i>somebody died.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:15.610
<i>I like to say they graduated.</i>

12:15.652 --> 12:19.572
I miss him very much,

12:19.614 --> 12:25.453
but I feel he's all around.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.794
Hold on.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.065
- She told me that she likes
working with young people

12:54.107 --> 12:55.358
because she can control them.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.360
And I was fine with that
in the beginning,

12:57.402 --> 13:00.780
but I was depending on her
to be an active participant.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.032
I didn't realize
that every time with her

13:02.073 --> 13:03.533
was a brand-new negotiation

13:03.575 --> 13:05.702
or everything from the past
just never happened.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.579
So when she wouldn't let me
talk to anyone important,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.873
I had no choice
but to do my own research,

13:09.914 --> 13:12.083
and she didn't like that.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.785
Huh.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.623
<i>Oh, please, Mr. Bear.</i>

13:51.664 --> 13:55.919
<i>I didn't mean to fall asleep</i>
<i>in your big, cozy bed.</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:58.421
<i>I was so tired.</i>

14:00.632 --> 14:03.051
<i>- What are you going</i>
<i>to do to me?</i>

14:03.093 --> 14:05.095
<i>- I'm going to eat you!</i>

14:05.136 --> 14:06.680
<i>- Oh, brother.</i>

14:06.721 --> 14:09.057
<i>Don't you just</i>
<i>wanna fuck instead?</i>

14:10.934 --> 14:12.936
That's not me.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.397
- What?

14:15.438 --> 14:17.607
That's your voice
and your face.

14:17.649 --> 14:22.779
- Max, the internet is a dark
and scary place, okay?

14:22.821 --> 14:28.618
Full of life-threatening
misinformation and fakery.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.829
- It was posted
by the Angelyne fan club.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.793
Yes, and sometimes people
see what they want to see.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.962
You can't be so gullible.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.380
- Well, if it's not you,

14:40.422 --> 14:43.466
we should email them
and have them take it down.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.135
- Oh, let--let's
leave it up for now.

14:45.176 --> 14:48.763
I don't even know
why you were looking at this.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.725
Are you looking into things
you should not be looking into?

14:51.766 --> 14:55.353
- What? No, it just--
it comes up when I Google you.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.733
- Then don't Google me.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.199
It's a documentary.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.747
Okay.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.295
<i>- She's a person</i>
<i>that everybody reacts to</i>

15:20.337 --> 15:23.840
<i>in one way or another.</i>

15:23.882 --> 15:25.467
<i>She draws people.</i>

15:25.508 --> 15:27.802
<i>She attracts people.</i>

15:34.392 --> 15:35.685
- Hello?

15:35.727 --> 15:38.021
<i>- He said</i>
<i>you haven't called him yet.</i>

15:38.063 --> 15:40.857
- I--I'm sorry?

15:40.899 --> 15:44.027
- Roger at Chevrolet.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.279
Are you asleep?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.698
- It's 4:00 in the morning.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.284
That's not a strange thing
to be doing right now.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.079
<i>- Do you not wanna</i>
<i>make this movie anymore?</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:58.041
- No. No, no, no.
I just...

15:58.083 --> 15:59.834
Did you need something?

15:59.876 --> 16:03.755
- I had a strange dream.

16:03.797 --> 16:07.133
- So you called me?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

16:07.175 --> 16:10.011
<i>I knew you would understand.</i>
<i>You're very intuitive.</i>

16:10.053 --> 16:12.222
- Yeah.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.890
What was the dream about?

16:13.932 --> 16:18.353
<i>- I was wandering</i>
<i>through an Egyptian pyramid</i>

16:18.395 --> 16:21.856
made by aliens
holding a flaming torch,

16:21.898 --> 16:24.734
and all the drawings

16:24.776 --> 16:26.820
looked like me

16:26.861 --> 16:29.364
but not like me, you know?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.157
- Do you believe in aliens?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.993
<i>- Rick saw</i>
<i>a flying saucer once.</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:37.038
You could ask him about it?

16:37.080 --> 16:42.460
- Yeah, I--I will if I ever
get the chance to talk to him.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.255
- Maximillian,
you have exclusive rights

16:45.296 --> 16:46.548
to this documentary.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.759
No one has ever done that
before, you know?

16:49.801 --> 16:52.137
<i>You have to be patient.</i>

16:52.178 --> 16:54.431
- Okay.

16:54.472 --> 16:58.309
Um, can I ask you something?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.603
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

17:00.645 --> 17:05.233
- So when this project's over

17:05.275 --> 17:07.944
and you're no longer
in the physical world--

17:07.986 --> 17:10.947
- You mean when I'm dead? Ooh.

17:10.989 --> 17:14.325
- Yes, when that happens.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.162
<i>- Max, you can't even say it?</i>
- Okay, fine.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.290
When you're dead...
- Yeah?

17:20.331 --> 17:24.294
- What do you want this film
to say about you?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.756
- That when I died,

17:27.797 --> 17:32.552
my spirit opened
a portal of white light

17:32.594 --> 17:38.391
and formed a path for it to
escape the awful pain of life.

17:38.433 --> 17:43.021
That's what I want it to say
that I escaped.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.316
Even when I was here.

17:46.358 --> 17:51.154
And that
I helped others escape too.

17:51.196 --> 17:55.325
<i>Max, can I trust you?</i>

17:55.367 --> 17:57.786
- Can you trust me?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.336
Always.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.213
- Then I'll let you
talk to Rick.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.840
<i>Sweet dreams,</i>
<i>gods and fairies.</i>

18:12.717 --> 18:14.719
- Wow. Yes!

18:19.391 --> 18:21.101
- I always knew
he was a fucking liar,

18:21.142 --> 18:23.269
and I never say that word.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.606
- I finally got
my first real interview.

18:26.648 --> 18:30.151
Rick, her right-hand man.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.278
There had to be a story there.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.488
<i>I just had to drive</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:34.614
<i>all the way to Idaho</i>
<i>to get it.</i>

18:34.656 --> 18:37.534
- Jean Harlow had it.
Marilyn had it.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.119
Carrie Grant had it.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.496
And Angelyne, she has it,
you know?

18:41.538 --> 18:46.084
It's a special something
that--it sets them apart.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.919
It makes them different
from everyone else,

18:47.961 --> 18:48.878
you know what I mean?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.340
Like, you and I,
we don't have it.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.342
- Yeah, but those people
all had--

18:57.137 --> 18:58.805
Right, we don't have it.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.892
- I mean, she taught me things
you just can't learn on a job.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.270
- Wait, you don't consider
working for Angelyne a job?

19:05.311 --> 19:07.522
- No, it's so much more
than that.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.650
I mean, sometimes it is work.

19:10.692 --> 19:14.029
But, uh,
no, we're more like family.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.782
It's--there are
some people in this world

19:17.824 --> 19:19.492
that you can count on
no matter what,

19:19.534 --> 19:22.203
people who are never
gonna betray your secrets.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.251
I said they're never
gonna betray your secrets!

19:28.293 --> 19:30.378
Okay.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.506
Yes, it's me.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.761
Oh, she wants to talk to you.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.974
- Angelyne?

19:43.016 --> 19:46.519
<i>- Maxi, have you started</i>
<i>filming Rick's interview yet?</i>

19:46.561 --> 19:48.313
- No, I'm just--
<i>- Oh, good.</i>

19:48.355 --> 19:50.982
<i>Because you need to give Rick</i>
<i>$300 for his time.</i>

19:51.024 --> 19:53.234
<i>And he owed 200</i>
<i>from back in March,</i>

19:53.276 --> 19:54.694
<i>but you could write that</i>
<i>on a separate check</i>

19:54.736 --> 19:56.154
<i>and I'll pay you back.</i>
<i>And Maxi,</i>

19:56.196 --> 20:00.408
<i>I've decided to give you</i>
<i>access to my full archives.</i>

20:00.450 --> 20:02.285
<i>The interviews,</i>
<i>the footage, everything.</i>

20:02.327 --> 20:04.204
<i>Maybe you can help re-edit</i>
<i>some of the stuff</i>

20:04.245 --> 20:05.413
<i>Rick put together?</i>

20:05.455 --> 20:07.957
<i>Say that last part out loud.</i>
- Huh?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.210
<i>- The part about</i>
<i>re-editing Rick's footage.</i>

20:10.251 --> 20:11.503
<i>Say that back to me.</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:14.172
- Re-editing Rick's footage.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.715
<i>- Good.</i>
<i>Good boy.</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:17.133
<i>We'll talk about it</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

20:17.175 --> 20:18.218
<i>When is that exactly?</i>

20:18.259 --> 20:20.303
- I'm not sure.
I just--

20:20.345 --> 20:22.806
Hel--hello?

20:28.395 --> 20:31.481
- She's giving you access
to my footage?

20:31.523 --> 20:33.066
- I guess.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.740
Hey, do you think
she ever turns it off?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.242
You know, like,
when she's home alone,

20:42.283 --> 20:46.371
she's not always dressed up
like--like Angelyne, right?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.539
- Who else would
she be dressed like?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.624
She is Angelyne.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.127
Honestly, I don't even
understand that question.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.670
Come on.
- Rick, can I--

20:53.712 --> 20:55.797
- Come on.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.719
<i>- I think I drove</i>
<i>all the way to Idaho</i>

21:00.760 --> 21:03.513
<i>just to deliver a message.</i>

21:03.555 --> 21:05.515
<i>But next,</i>
<i>she made it seem like</i>

21:05.557 --> 21:07.100
<i>I was finally</i>
<i>gonna meet Harold,</i>

21:07.142 --> 21:08.893
<i>so I went along with it.</i>

21:08.935 --> 21:11.354
- I've a to-go order
for Angelyne?

21:11.396 --> 21:13.565
- Yes.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.900
- You're the new one.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.653
- New one?

21:18.695 --> 21:22.115
No, I am not an assistant.
I'm actually a filmmaker.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.242
I'm doing a documentary
on Angelyne.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.578
- Oh, she even has you wearing
one of her little T-shirts.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.955
That's so cute.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.590
- Come on.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.265
- Harold can't see you today.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.642
- What? Why?

21:49.684 --> 21:52.771
- Because he lives
in a very exclusive place

21:52.812 --> 21:54.689
for ultra-phenomenal people,

21:54.731 --> 21:57.275
and they are very particular
about his time.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.069
- What kind of place?

21:59.110 --> 22:02.197
- It's just a place
that he's at during the day,

22:02.238 --> 22:03.782
and in the evenings.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.283
- So it's like
a retirement home

22:05.325 --> 22:08.286
for old people?

22:08.328 --> 22:10.830
- No, it's nothing like that.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.791
- Well, can I see him
another time?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.292
- Maybe.
- Because I've been doing

22:14.334 --> 22:16.503
all this research to prepare,
so maybe I could just go--

22:16.544 --> 22:18.004
- You need to accept
what I tell you

22:18.046 --> 22:19.798
and not concern yourself
with things

22:19.839 --> 22:23.551
that are outside of your--
whatever.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.136
If I want you
to find something out,

22:25.178 --> 22:27.055
I will tell you that thing,
and then you won't have to go

22:27.097 --> 22:29.974
looking for that thing
because it'll be right there.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.812
- Why can't you just admit
that he's in a home?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.397
- Because it's not true.
- Oh, my God.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.357
I can't even talk to you!

22:37.399 --> 22:38.983
- I think
you should be a good boy

22:39.025 --> 22:42.362
and go interview my optometrist
tomorrow instead.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.405
I told him you were coming.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.656
It's all set up.
- No.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.158
- Give him a kiss for me,
will you? And $300.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.369
- I said--

22:49.411 --> 22:52.455
<i>- Nobody says no to me.</i>

22:52.497 --> 22:54.040
You wanna fight?

22:54.082 --> 22:57.836
I'm feisty.
I like to fight.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.879
- So I told her no.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.674
And that was it.
I was done.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.969
I said no!

23:06.011 --> 23:10.348
- You can't bring that
negativity into my spaceship.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.934
It can't exist in my airspace.

23:12.976 --> 23:16.229
There's no oxygen for it here.

23:17.981 --> 23:21.776
- Fuck!

23:21.818 --> 23:23.194
<i>I was done.</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:24.821
<i>I wasn't gonna let her</i>
<i>control me anymore.</i>

23:26.656 --> 23:30.577
But the truth is, I needed her.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.370
It was a documentary
about Angelyne.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.747
What was I supposed to do?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.206
<i>Hey, Angelyne.</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:37.125
It's me.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.919
Listen, about earlier,
I think--

23:39.961 --> 23:41.755
I think I might have
overreacted a little bit,

23:41.796 --> 23:43.882
so give me a call back, okay?

23:43.923 --> 23:48.094
Angelyne,
it's Maximillian again.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.723
Look, I'm--I'm sorry.
I--I messed up, okay?

23:51.765 --> 23:53.933
Let's talk about this.
Call me back.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.061
Hey, it's Max.
Listen, I wanna keep going.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.063
But it's not
a bottomless well, okay?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.272
Call me back.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.566
<i>So I sent a check</i>
<i>to your optometrist,</i>

24:01.608 --> 24:04.652
<i>you know, in good faith</i>
<i>against a future interview.</i>

24:04.694 --> 24:07.030
Call me back.

24:07.072 --> 24:10.116
<i>- I just write people off</i>
<i>who say no to me.</i>

24:10.158 --> 24:14.371
But he came crawling back.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.791
So I took pity on him.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.923
- After the eighth message,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.842
she finally picked up.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.345
She suggested that we meet up
to work it out,

24:30.387 --> 24:33.431
and I foolishly thought
everything was gonna be okay.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.311
Rick.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.105
- Max.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.607
- Uh, what are you doing here?

24:42.649 --> 24:45.235
- Well, like I said,
there are people in this world

24:45.276 --> 24:47.237
you can count on,

24:47.278 --> 24:50.407
and then
there are other people.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.534
- I don't have all day, Max.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.577
- Oh, um, right. Sorry.

24:54.619 --> 24:57.288
Well, like I said
in the voicemails,

24:57.330 --> 24:58.790
I'm really sorry.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.459
- I don't believe in sorry.
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.462
- Look, we have both invested
a lot in this project,

25:04.504 --> 25:06.798
and I think that we should
figure out a way to finish it.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.174
- I don't know, Max.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.385
I'm starting
to have real concern

25:10.427 --> 25:13.388
that you have what it takes
to finish this.

25:13.430 --> 25:16.683
I think you're plagued
by self-doubt,

25:16.725 --> 25:21.146
and I don't like doubters.

25:21.187 --> 25:26.192
But I am willing to give you

25:26.234 --> 25:28.069
one more chance...

25:28.111 --> 25:32.323
- To screw it up
or get it right.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.206
- Uh, what is this?

25:40.248 --> 25:42.000
- I've made you a list
of stipulations

25:42.042 --> 25:43.376
and financial assurances

25:43.418 --> 25:47.047
to show me you are taking
this project seriously

25:47.088 --> 25:48.757
and help me feel safe.

25:48.798 --> 25:53.303
- Um, the purchase
of one original painting.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.722
2 grand?
- Mm-hmm.

25:55.764 --> 25:57.390
- You want me to buy
another painting?

25:57.432 --> 26:01.478
- You can choose
whichever you like.

26:01.519 --> 26:02.937
- 5 grand to interview Rick?

26:02.979 --> 26:04.898
I already interviewed him.
I interviewed you.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.983
- You didn't ask
any good questions.

26:07.025 --> 26:10.320
- You have 24 hours.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.614
<i>- So I told her</i>
<i>I would think about it.</i>

26:12.655 --> 26:15.450
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to finish my movie.</i>

26:17.786 --> 26:19.037
<i>Hey, this is Max.</i>

26:19.079 --> 26:20.538
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

26:22.040 --> 26:23.917
<i>- Max, I haven't</i>
<i>heard anything from you.</i>

26:23.958 --> 26:25.377
<i>You're lollygagging.</i>

26:25.418 --> 26:28.171
<i>What's it going to be?</i>
<i>Are you in or out?</i>

26:30.090 --> 26:32.175
<i>Max, you are</i>
<i>holding up production.</i>

26:32.217 --> 26:34.928
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what I was afraid of, okay?</i>

26:34.969 --> 26:37.472
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>Maxi?</i>

26:39.391 --> 26:41.393
<i>This is my third message,</i>
<i>and three's a charm.</i>

26:41.434 --> 26:43.853
<i>If you don't answer me</i>
<i>in one hour,</i>

26:43.895 --> 26:46.481
<i>I am going to charge you</i>
<i>an extra $100</i>

26:46.523 --> 26:48.108
<i>for being unprofessional</i>

26:48.149 --> 26:51.152
<i>and treating this project</i>
<i>like it's a hobby, okay?</i>

26:51.194 --> 26:54.114
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to be part of a hobby.</i>

26:54.155 --> 26:58.660
- And that's a cut.

26:58.702 --> 27:00.954
Great.
Thank you so much.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.622
That was very helpful.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.790
I loved hearing your stories.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.460
<i>- Listen, Maxi,</i>
<i>my lawyer is suggesting</i>

27:07.502 --> 27:09.796
<i>that there be some kind</i>
<i>of a time restraint</i>

27:09.838 --> 27:12.465
<i>or constraint or some kind</i>
<i>of "-straint" on this thing.</i>

27:12.507 --> 27:15.260
<i>I mean, he says you could take</i>
<i>forever to make this movie,</i>

27:15.301 --> 27:18.096
<i>but you are only allowed</i>
<i>to bother me for 12 months</i>

27:18.138 --> 27:19.347
<i>after we sign this thing.</i>

27:19.389 --> 27:20.724
<i>Otherwise, you could</i>
<i>just carry on</i>

27:20.765 --> 27:22.225
<i>just needing me forever.</i>

27:22.267 --> 27:24.686
<i>I told him that you have</i>
<i>my best interest at heart,</i>

27:24.728 --> 27:27.647
<i>which is shocking,</i>
<i>but I know it's true. Bye.</i>

27:27.689 --> 27:29.024
- Harold?
- Yeah.

27:29.065 --> 27:31.609
- Hi. I'm ready.
- Hi. Thank you.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.987
- Come on.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.781
- She promised me Harold.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.575
I just fulfilled
that promise myself.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.118
She was only gone 20 minutes--

27:40.160 --> 27:41.870
10 minutes there,
10 minutes back--

27:41.911 --> 27:43.163
so I visited
every retirement home

27:43.204 --> 27:44.748
within a 10-minute radius
of that Denny's

27:44.789 --> 27:46.249
until I found the one
that Harold was living at.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.959
And then, I volunteered there
for three months

27:48.001 --> 27:49.336
until our paths crossed.

27:49.377 --> 27:52.130
And that's when I met Harold.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.679
So, Harold.
- Ooh.

27:59.721 --> 28:00.847
- I'm Max.
- Ooh.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.974
Hi, Max.
- Hi.

28:03.016 --> 28:06.394
Right. So you can talk
about whatever you like,

28:06.436 --> 28:10.065
or I can ask you questions,
help us get started.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.192
- I have one for you.
How old are you?

28:12.233 --> 28:14.861
- I'm 23.
- 23.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.572
You're young.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.616
See, I'm 86,
but I still think I'm young.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.701
That's my problem.

28:21.743 --> 28:26.498
- Hey, Harold, you and I
actually have a common friend.

28:26.539 --> 28:30.377
- Well, most of my friends
are dead, so...

28:30.418 --> 28:32.879
- It's Angelyne.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.756
That's our common friend.

28:34.798 --> 28:38.051
- Ooh?
- Mm-hmm.

28:38.093 --> 28:39.594
- How is Angelyne?

28:39.636 --> 28:42.097
- You know, I actually haven't
talked to her in a while.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.557
I should probably
give her a call.

28:44.599 --> 28:45.892
What about you?
When was the last time

28:45.934 --> 28:47.102
that you saw Angelyne?

28:52.607 --> 28:54.067
- Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.985
His family has
explicitly stated

28:56.027 --> 28:57.362
he's not to leave the premises.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.738
Ma'am.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.408
- Come on.
Let's zoom.

29:01.449 --> 29:05.078
<i>- Angelyne has a force</i>
<i>that brings about miracles.</i>

29:05.120 --> 29:07.414
We can't just leave.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.416
- Says who?

29:12.085 --> 29:14.671
- All right.

29:14.713 --> 29:16.297
- You don't need that thing.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.008
No.

29:18.049 --> 29:21.094
Hold on to me.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.472
Wanna go for a ride?

29:24.514 --> 29:25.807
<i>- If you give her something,</i>

29:25.849 --> 29:28.059
<i>something will come to you</i>
<i>that's good.</i>

29:28.101 --> 29:30.145
<i>This--this never fails.</i>

29:34.065 --> 29:35.859
- Of course, eventually,
I wanted to retire,

29:35.900 --> 29:37.986
and she...

29:38.445 --> 29:41.656
Eh, she took it well. Yeah.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.874
Harold?

29:50.915 --> 29:53.960
Where is he?
- Shit.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.754
- Hmm?
- I don't know.

29:55.795 --> 30:00.884
He was here, but he might be
making some calls right now.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.636
Um, can I get you something?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.643
- Hi, I was just--

30:10.685 --> 30:12.103
- Who is Doug?

30:12.145 --> 30:16.232
- Uh, Doug is a lovely man.
He's lovely.

30:16.274 --> 30:18.943
- He called to say
he's excited to work with me.

30:18.985 --> 30:22.781
- He is excited, yeah.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.199
- You're passing me off?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.659
- Passing you--no, no.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.120
- Oh, so--so he's not
taking over the printing?

30:29.162 --> 30:30.538
- Well, yes.
- And the billboards?

30:30.580 --> 30:32.332
- Well, yes.
Everything, in fact.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.292
But that is why
he is so excited.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.669
I mean, who wouldn't be?

30:35.710 --> 30:37.253
- Me!

30:41.007 --> 30:44.552
I am not excited.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.430
- Angelyne.

30:47.472 --> 30:50.767
Angelyne--all right.
Come on.

30:50.809 --> 30:52.852
No, that's not funny.
That's not funny.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.604
Angelyne! Angelyne!

30:54.646 --> 30:58.525
So I found a guy,
a printer I know up in Reno.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.776
I introduced him,

30:59.818 --> 31:02.487
kinda like her band manager
did it with me.

31:02.529 --> 31:05.115
- Her band manager?
You mean Cory, right?

31:05.156 --> 31:06.783
- Oh, was that his name?
I can't...

31:06.825 --> 31:11.204
I did his band--the posters--
but then he disappeared.

31:11.246 --> 31:13.373
- Sure, sure. And what--

31:13.415 --> 31:16.209
What happened with them?
With her and Cory?

31:16.251 --> 31:19.337
- Well, you'd have to
ask him that.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.686
- Hey.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.231
- Did anybody follow you?

31:38.273 --> 31:41.234
- I don't think so.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.403
No, I wasn't followed.

31:43.445 --> 31:44.863
- You can't be too careful.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.115
You're looking for Angelyne,
somebody's looking for me.

31:47.157 --> 31:48.825
We're all out there, looking.

31:48.867 --> 31:51.578
Good news, though, I found her.
It wasn't hard.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.496
She drives
a fucking pink Corvette, man.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.999
- No, no, no, I'm not looking
for Angelyne.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.419
I'm looking for information
on Angelyne, who she is really.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.338
- Well, that part's
a bit trickier,

32:01.379 --> 32:04.257
'cause Angelyne with a Y,
Angeline with an I,

32:04.299 --> 32:05.967
Angel Lynne,
Angel Allyn,

32:06.009 --> 32:07.427
Goldman, Simms.

32:07.469 --> 32:09.429
There's eight names,
six civil cases,

32:09.471 --> 32:12.640
four social security numbers,
and two driver's licenses.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.559
It's all right there
in the report,

32:14.601 --> 32:16.853
but there's nothing on her
before 1978.

32:16.895 --> 32:18.146
- Okay, okay.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.982
What about the guy
that I mentioned, Cory Hunt?

32:21.024 --> 32:22.484
Is there anything
on him in here?

32:22.525 --> 32:23.818
- The boyfriend?
- Yeah.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.737
- Not much.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.280
- Well, can you
find him for me?

32:27.322 --> 32:29.574
- Sure, for an additional fee.

32:34.287 --> 32:36.206
- Okay.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.541
Okay, fine.
Cory, then.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.378
I'll just keep looking
into Angelyne myself.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.338
- Why would he request
my driving record?

32:43.380 --> 32:45.757
This is an invasion
of privacy, right?

32:45.799 --> 32:49.135
Can we call the police?
- I got his voicemail.

32:49.177 --> 32:52.222
<i>Hey, why would you request</i>
<i>Angelyne's driving records?</i>

32:52.263 --> 32:55.975
<i>You need help, Max.</i>
<i>You're sick!</i>

32:56.017 --> 32:58.603
<i>Please call me back.</i>
<i>This is Rick Krauss.</i>

33:03.233 --> 33:06.653
- He tried
to steal my identity.

33:07.904 --> 33:11.282
- I can't make a documentary
without information.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.882
- Found Cory Hunt.
Wasn't hard.

33:27.924 --> 33:31.177
He still plays in a bunch
of bands under that name.

33:31.219 --> 33:34.723
Bad news is,
he's in upstate New York.

33:34.764 --> 33:36.266
- Hmm.

33:38.935 --> 33:42.313
- How long
has she been out there?

33:42.355 --> 33:45.316
- About an hour.

33:46.443 --> 33:49.070
- You should get some rest.

33:49.112 --> 33:52.157
You don't look so hot.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.660
<i>- I wasn't sleeping.</i>
<i>I lost a bunch of weight.</i>

33:55.702 --> 33:58.580
I know I should have quit but

33:58.621 --> 34:03.335
instead, I flew to New York
to see Cory.

34:19.392 --> 34:21.936
- I had a billboard
for this song.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.655
me in the hospital,
and her just walking away.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.329
Of course, I still talk to her.

34:39.371 --> 34:43.541
Our paths are connected, man.
That will never change.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.378
- And what about
before all of that?

34:46.419 --> 34:47.921
Prior to 1978?

34:49.506 --> 34:52.258
- That didn't matter.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.718
- Okay.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.388
There are all these stories,
and they don't add up.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.515
She never had a mother.
Her mother was her best friend.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.392
She was raised
by maids and nannies.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.686
She was an only child.
She had an older sister.

35:02.727 --> 35:05.105
She grew up in Idaho.
She grew up in Ohio.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.356
She grew up in Iowa.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.191
She was beamed down
from a fucking spaceship.

35:08.233 --> 35:09.734
I mean, is any of it true?

35:09.776 --> 35:14.489
- All right.
Well, she does have a sister.

35:14.531 --> 35:16.700
- She does?
- Yeah.

35:16.741 --> 35:18.118
Leah.

35:21.871 --> 35:24.708
- She's never
gonna talk to you.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.292
Hey, man.
Look at you, man.

35:26.334 --> 35:27.836
Are you listening to me?

35:27.877 --> 35:31.506
You gotta stop this shit, man.
Let it go.

35:31.548 --> 35:33.925
Believe me.
I've been where you are.

35:35.552 --> 35:36.845
<i>- Listen, Max,</i>
<i>I have spoken</i>

35:36.886 --> 35:38.346
<i>to some people</i>
<i>that you've interviewed,</i>

35:38.388 --> 35:41.016
<i>and I know you've been asking</i>
<i>inappropriate questions.</i>

35:41.057 --> 35:43.184
<i>I'm willing to give you</i>
<i>one more chance,</i>

35:43.226 --> 35:44.853
<i>but it's going to be $5,000...</i>

36:04.205 --> 36:06.374
<i>Leah's name was the key.</i>

36:06.416 --> 36:07.792
Of course, Cory was right.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.670
She wasn't gonna talk to me,
but I didn't need her to.

36:10.712 --> 36:13.548
Facts don't lie.
Documents don't lie.

36:15.133 --> 36:16.885
Hey, man, right here,
you should probably

36:16.926 --> 36:18.720
put in some supportive graphics
to explain on this,

36:18.762 --> 36:20.638
'cause it's actually
pretty complicated

36:20.680 --> 36:22.599
how I figured it all out.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.892
All the information was public.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.393
I just had to know
where to look.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.062
I searched for the name "Leah,"

36:27.103 --> 36:29.147
plus every last name that
I'd previously come across,

36:29.189 --> 36:32.233
and that led me to her father,
Eli Goldman.

36:32.275 --> 36:35.737
And that's when I found Rachel

36:35.779 --> 36:38.656
and everything
that came along with it.

36:38.698 --> 36:41.534
<i>I found where she lived</i>
<i>as a kid in Los Angeles.</i>

36:41.576 --> 36:44.454
<i>I found her schools</i>
<i>and her high school yearbooks.</i>

36:44.496 --> 36:47.165
<i>So many photographs of the way</i>
<i>that she used to look.</i>

36:47.207 --> 36:48.291
I went through county records,

36:48.333 --> 36:50.210
and I found overdue bills
and lawsuits.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.421
I went all the way to Poland,
where she was born, okay?

36:53.463 --> 36:54.464
I found it all.

36:56.966 --> 37:01.763
In the end, I'm not sure
it matters so much,

37:01.805 --> 37:03.682
because either way,

37:03.723 --> 37:08.353
she is still uniquely,
defiantly Angelyne.

37:08.395 --> 37:10.438
And that's why we love her.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.823
<i>I wanted her to know</i>
<i>that I did it.</i>

37:19.864 --> 37:22.117
<i>That I found out</i>
<i>who she really was.</i>

37:22.158 --> 37:24.327
<i>That there was nothing</i>
<i>she could hide from me.</i>

37:24.369 --> 37:26.287
<i>I wanted all of the pieces</i>
<i>of the puzzle.</i>

37:30.917 --> 37:32.627
<i>I guess I felt like</i>
<i>she owed me that.</i>

37:32.669 --> 37:34.546
- She owed you?
- Yeah.

37:34.587 --> 37:35.797
After everything I spent,

37:35.839 --> 37:37.257
Angelyne was extorting money
from me

37:37.298 --> 37:38.800
the whole time just
to keep the project moving.

37:38.842 --> 37:41.761
- Extorting? Please.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.638
- Let me show you what I mean.

37:59.362 --> 38:02.073
- This individual
is clearly obsessed with me.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.367
Who buys this much stuff
unless they're obsessed?

38:04.409 --> 38:07.162
- I can't afford to start over
with another subject.

38:07.203 --> 38:08.329
I need to be able
to tell this story.

38:08.371 --> 38:09.622
- My story.

38:09.664 --> 38:11.166
- At this point,
I know so much about you,

38:11.207 --> 38:12.667
I might know you better
than you know yourself.

38:12.709 --> 38:16.963
- Hey, let's lower our voice--
- No, it's true.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.549
- I try to see
the best in people.

38:19.591 --> 38:22.510
I try to inspire them.

38:22.552 --> 38:25.055
Some people just
don't have what it takes.

38:25.096 --> 38:27.265
It's sad, really.

38:27.307 --> 38:30.143
I guess I was wrong.

38:30.185 --> 38:33.188
You are not a filmmaker.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.567
- Okay.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.152
Maybe it's time
we took a break.

38:44.616 --> 38:47.660
- I think I can put an end
to this, if you'll let me.

38:47.702 --> 38:49.454
Just ask her
some simple questions,

38:49.496 --> 38:50.789
establish a baseline fact.

38:50.830 --> 38:53.083
- She won't answer them.

38:53.124 --> 38:54.918
- Exactly.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.420
She won't tell the truth, Max.

38:57.462 --> 38:59.464
She will lie.

38:59.506 --> 39:02.384
And all we have to do
is catch her in a lie, any lie,

39:02.425 --> 39:06.221
and everything she says
from that point on is suspect.

39:06.262 --> 39:09.808
We both know
she will lie about this.

39:14.479 --> 39:16.690
- Okay. Do it.

39:22.570 --> 39:26.533
- Angelyne, I--

39:26.574 --> 39:29.452
I just want to go back
and establish a few things

39:29.494 --> 39:31.871
for the record, just to--
just to clear it up.

39:31.913 --> 39:34.374
- I thought he knew
everything about me.

39:34.416 --> 39:39.212
- Well, he certainly
found out quite a lot.

39:39.254 --> 39:44.259
But--well,
this is a birth certificate

39:44.300 --> 39:47.470
for a person named
Rachel Goldman,

39:47.512 --> 39:50.557
born in Poland, hmm?

39:50.598 --> 39:52.517
Now, Rachel Goldman
was the daughter

39:52.559 --> 39:54.269
of Eli and Rivka Goldman,

39:54.310 --> 39:57.939
who met during World War II
in the Chmielnik ghetto

39:57.981 --> 40:00.817
before being sent to a series
of concentration camps,

40:00.859 --> 40:02.318
first together to Skarzysko,

40:02.360 --> 40:04.863
and then separately
to Buchenwald, Birkenau,

40:04.904 --> 40:06.948
Flossenburg, and Dachau.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.825
After the war, the two reunited

40:08.867 --> 40:11.494
in the Bergen-Belsen
Displaced Persons camp.

40:11.536 --> 40:12.829
They were married.

40:12.871 --> 40:15.248
The Goldmans had
two children in Poland

40:15.290 --> 40:18.084
before settling outside
of Tel Aviv,

40:18.126 --> 40:20.337
where they lived
until Rachel was nine years old

40:20.378 --> 40:23.840
and her sister, Leah,
was seven.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.551
The family then left
for America,

40:26.593 --> 40:29.346
aboard a cruise ship
called the S.S. Israel.

40:29.387 --> 40:32.682
Upon arriving in the U.S.
via New York,

40:32.724 --> 40:36.895
the family settled
in California.

40:36.936 --> 40:40.315
And then,
when Rachel was only 14,

40:40.357 --> 40:42.067
her mother died.

40:42.108 --> 40:45.445
And by 17, she was married
to a man named Danny Katz,

40:45.487 --> 40:49.074
but less than a year later,
they divorced.

40:49.115 --> 40:51.701
And then,

40:51.743 --> 40:55.663
Rachel Goldman disappeared...

40:55.705 --> 40:58.208
until 2016,

40:58.249 --> 41:02.128
when Rachel Goldman
legally changed her name

41:02.170 --> 41:06.966
to Angelyne L'Lyne, stating,
"This is my stage name

41:07.008 --> 41:11.680
that I use
and have used since 1978."

41:11.721 --> 41:16.184
It's your name.

41:16.226 --> 41:21.523
So I'll ask you,
for the record,

41:21.564 --> 41:23.525
are you Rachel Goldman?

41:39.874 --> 41:41.835
- Angelyne.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.295
Please,
answer the question truthfully.

41:44.337 --> 41:47.298
You have to maintain
your credibility or we'll lose.

42:00.186 --> 42:02.063
- Angelyne,
please answer the question.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.356
- Just tell the truth for once.

42:03.398 --> 42:04.941
- Answer the question,
and it all goes away.

42:29.341 --> 42:32.552
- She actually told the truth.

42:34.179 --> 42:35.847
I couldn't believe it.

42:35.889 --> 42:38.767
- I never said any such thing.

42:38.808 --> 42:40.477
That did not happen.

42:40.518 --> 42:42.187
The man's a proven liar.

42:42.228 --> 42:44.439
He can't help himself.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.043
Hey!

43:13.468 --> 43:15.428
- Okay, so months later,
the arbitrator emailed me

43:15.470 --> 43:18.181
and he said that she didn't
technically do anything wrong,

43:18.223 --> 43:20.016
I didn't technically
do anything wrong,

43:20.058 --> 43:21.935
but we should get back together

43:21.976 --> 43:25.605
if anyone technically
does anything wrong.

43:25.647 --> 43:27.440
But it's not like--

43:27.482 --> 43:29.067
it's not like
I can't work on the film.

43:29.109 --> 43:31.486
I mean, I can finish it
if I want to,

43:31.528 --> 43:35.073
or I can do something else
with it.

43:35.115 --> 43:38.076
I can, and I might.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.704
I just have to--

43:40.745 --> 43:43.832
I have to work on it with her.

43:43.873 --> 43:50.588
- I suppose, technically,
this individual can continue

43:50.630 --> 43:56.636
to work on his documentary
if I agree to participate,

43:56.678 --> 43:58.638
which I didn't.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.765
And I don't.

44:00.807 --> 44:03.685
And I won't, so...

44:07.022 --> 44:09.816
Look, I really want him
to be able

44:09.858 --> 44:15.196
to make whatever story
he's trying to make, I do,

44:15.238 --> 44:16.781
as long as it doesn't interfere
with the story

44:16.823 --> 44:18.283
you're trying to tell

44:18.324 --> 44:20.785
or with the story
I'm trying to tell,

44:20.827 --> 44:23.830
which is my story.

44:27.208 --> 44:30.670
that legally, technically,
there is no end.

44:40.805 --> 44:42.223
Hello?

44:42.265 --> 44:43.850
<i>- Angelyne?</i>

44:43.892 --> 44:46.436
<i>Jeff Glasner,</i>
<i>"The Hollywood Reporter."</i>

44:46.478 --> 44:49.147
<i>It's been a while.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

44:51.733 --> 44:54.235
How did you get this number?

44:54.277 --> 44:56.780
<i>- I'm calling because...</i>

44:56.821 --> 45:00.158
<i>we're gonna run</i>

45:00.200 --> 45:05.872
