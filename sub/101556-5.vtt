28:29.541 --> 28:30.584
Not long.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.253
But it's all just been baby steps
so far, you know...

28:33.337 --> 28:36.173
Is that why you decided to come out here
and spend the night...

28:36.924 --> 28:38.592
so you could spring this on me?

28:39.468 --> 28:41.386
Gordo, I was hoping
you'd be happy for me.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.139
It's just kind of surprising, I guess.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.308
You kind of...
You sort of sideswiped me, is all.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.602
Well, I was excited to tell you.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.065

Hey. Hey.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.659
I just... I just want you to be happy.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.204
Me, too.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.124
I am happy.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.713
That's all that matters.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.805

O...Okay, then. I guess. (CHUCKLES)

We got a seance, right now.

Is this going to take long?
We gotta go see Trudy's mom.

30:19.670 --> 30:22.237
No, it shouldn't take too long at all.
Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat.

wanna be cooped up in here

30:25.866 --> 30:28.452
and I'm sure neither do you.
So, I'll just get right to it.

-You're pregnant.
-Yes, Wally, I'm pregnant

as much as the next guy.

All right. That's my choice.
I get that it's not for everyone.

the allure of the female form.

The details of it don't matter.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.736
It happened and now it's done.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.697
What matters is that
we all need to agree on a few things

31:05.781 --> 31:08.200
about how we're going to conduct
ourselves from this point on.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.284

31:09.368 --> 31:12.162
I hopped down to Tijuana,
found a girl...

-What are we gonna do?
-It's already done. I did it.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.425
I called the publisher.
I got him to spike the story.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.888
-Thanks for helping a guy out, John.
-JOHN: Uh, you're welcome, Al.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.016
But I think we all need to understand,
all of us,

31:34.684 --> 31:36.186
that what we have here is fragile,

31:36.645 --> 31:39.773
especially now, with the program
not doing so hot.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.566
Now, it might be that, uh...

31:41.858 --> 31:45.445
Loudon and <i>LIFE Magazine</i> have lulled us
into a fall sense of security

31:45.529 --> 31:47.365
'cause we all know
what they've done for us.

31:47.465 --> 31:49.616

into chocolate cake.

JOHN: And it's a good thing
they have, right?

31:51.576 --> 31:53.130
I mean, come on,
it's because of them that...

31:53.230 --> 31:55.163
that we don't have to look like
a bunch of movie stars

31:55.247 --> 31:56.498
or, uh, give fancy speeches.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.085
Guys, come on.
We're heroes here. (CHUCKLES)

We haven't even done anything yet,
but that's how folks see us.

And all we got to do...
is not screw that up.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.971
Now, what happened last night
put this program at risk.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.556
Make no mistake.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.392
And we have to make sure
that nothing like that happens again.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.436
And we all need to agree.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.315
I said thank you, John.
I think we can just leave it at that.

Wait, wait. Do you understand
what I'm saying, though?

Sure thing, boss.

Guys, we were in it so deep last night,
even Shorty didn't know what to do.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.127
I had to get that publisher out of bed,
plead with him.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.298
Even then, I wasn't sure if it had worked
until I saw the paper this morning.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.216
You called Shorty?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.761
Yeah, to help us out.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.139
So, NASA knows about all this?

32:56.099 --> 32:57.142
I can't believe you, John.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.019
I'm sorry. You can't believe me, Al?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.354
This is about being first. That's all.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.608
You heard that they were about to choose
and figured this would cinch it for you.

-That's why you did it.
-No. I did this to help you,

33:06.985 --> 33:08.153
-to help all of us.
-No.

You sold me out so you could win.
At least have the guts to admit it.

Hey, you're the one that came to me,
right? You asked for my help.

his own business, Al.

that we are today

we stare it in the face for a living.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.342
shelled out all the money
that made that happen.

And I made <i>LIFE</i> happen,
and I didn't do it for me.

and for the good of this program.
