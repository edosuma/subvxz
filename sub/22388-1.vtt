PENN: <i>From the Rio</i>
<i>All-Suite Hotel in Las Vegas,</i>

00:24.933 --> 00:28.133
<i>here's your host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:28.467 --> 00:30.700
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:36.667 --> 00:38.067
Thank you, so much.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.600
Welcome to <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:44.567
The show with illusions more convincing

00:44.633 --> 00:46.700
than the story you told
your partner about what you did

00:46.767 --> 00:48.433
the last time you came to Las Vegas.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.433
Backstage are some
of the greatest magicians in the world.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.200
Now, they're not here to fool me
because, of course, that would be easy.

00:55.267 --> 00:58.800
Why, only last year, I gave all
my life savings to a Nigerian prince.

00:58.867 --> 00:59.867
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:00.267 --> 01:03.367
No, tonight our acts have the harder task
of trying to dupe the un-dupable,

01:03.433 --> 01:05.233
the great Penn and Teller.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.967
Now, leaving Teller speechless
is pretty much a given,

01:08.067 --> 01:11.167
but having Penn shut up means
you've done something really remarkable.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.033
Here they are right now.
Will you please go crazy

01:13.100 --> 01:17.200
for magic's version of Donnie and Marie.
It is, of course, Penn and Teller!

01:17.667 --> 01:19.533
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:25.267 --> 01:28.500
Great to see you, as always.
Penn, fabulous, you're looking great.

01:28.567 --> 01:29.567
Thank you, Jon.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.767
I'm a little bit country.
He's a little bit rock 'n' roll.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.500
That's the way we like to roll.
So, ladies and gentlemen,

01:35.567 --> 01:37.300
I'm gonna ask you guys
to get comfortable in your seats

01:37.367 --> 01:38.733
so we can get on with the show.
It's Penn and Teller,

01:38.800 --> 01:40.533
-ladies and gentlemen!
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:53.000 --> 01:55.667
Without further ado,
let's get the show going,

01:55.867 --> 01:57.767
and let's bring out our first magician.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.667
Hi, I'm Jon Armstrong,
and I'm originally from Orlando, Florida.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.900
<i>I am dyslexic, and school</i>
<i>was impossible for me.</i>

02:08.133 --> 02:11.700
But then I discovered comics,
and I could really enjoy them.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.767
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I always wanted to be a superhero.</i>

02:14.433 --> 02:16.200
Actually, I still want to be a superhero.

02:16.867 --> 02:21.267
<i>One of my proudest achievements was that</i>
<i>I was able to co-write my own comic book.</i>

02:21.367 --> 02:23.267
<i>It's about a magician like myself.</i>

02:23.333 --> 02:24.467
Hold out your hand.

02:25.867 --> 02:28.533
<i>I'm attracted to magic</i>
<i>and comics for the same reason.</i>

02:29.100 --> 02:32.533
They're both these amazing
sort of art forms that allow the author,

02:32.600 --> 02:37.700
the creator, to give their audience
a world they never thought was possible.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.600
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

02:46.000 --> 02:49.033
This next performer became
the resident magician at Disney World

02:49.100 --> 02:51.900
when he was just 20 years old,
which means we know he can fool

02:51.967 --> 02:54.967
a giant mouse and a talking duck,
but can he fool Penn and Teller?

02:55.033 --> 02:57.033
Please welcome Jon Armstrong!

02:57.400 --> 02:58.400
(APPLAUSE)

02:58.600 --> 03:01.533
Thank you!
Wow, this is amazing.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.733
It's an honor to be here.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.067
I was wondering
if I can get you two gentlemen

03:05.133 --> 03:07.300
to come and join me up here.
And Jonathan, you seem nice enough.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.300
-I'll go here. You go there?
-Yeah, if you don't mind.

03:09.367 --> 03:10.367
PENN: It frightens me.
JONATHAN: I'll go here.

03:10.433 --> 03:13.133
Uh, it's actually not me that's here
to fool you. It's this little guy here.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.167
It's a suction cup attached
to a tiny dowel rod.

03:16.233 --> 03:17.233
It is adorable.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.567
I know.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.200
What I'm gonna show you
is the most impressive thing

03:20.267 --> 03:21.500
you'll ever see in your entire life.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.200
Seriously, from this moment on,
your lives are gonna go downhill.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.733
When I do this for little kids,
I feel bad.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.200
All right, watch.

03:29.767 --> 03:30.767
Thank you.

03:31.433 --> 03:32.867
All right, all right.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.600
Just kidding, but you can see
the little suction cup, you know,

03:35.667 --> 03:39.567
that it's only supposed
to pick up one card at a time, right?

03:39.633 --> 03:40.700
That's how it works.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.167
But if you give it
a little bit of a rev, watch...

03:44.667 --> 03:45.667
Till it works.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.000
You guys just see this every day?
Is that the idea?

03:48.067 --> 03:50.833
Check this out, check this out.
Make sure there's sticky tape,

03:50.900 --> 03:51.900
nothing like that on 'em.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.067
Check out the plunger.
Make sure it's a perfectly ordinary,

03:54.133 --> 03:56.967
tiny plunger that you'd find
in any Barbie dream home.

03:57.033 --> 03:58.400
-Yeah.
-Yes, okay, good.

03:58.467 --> 03:59.500
Take it back.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.967
We're in America.
What do we care about? Bulk.

04:04.233 --> 04:07.067
(WHISPERING)
You can do it, buddy. You can do it.

04:07.933 --> 04:08.933
PENN: Oh!

04:09.067 --> 04:10.400
JON: Tiny plunger.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.500
(APPLAUSE)

04:12.833 --> 04:17.300
Now, the tiny plunger, he is educated,
he is learned, he understands things.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.367
I'll show you what I mean by that.

04:18.433 --> 04:21.600
Jonathan, give me
a number between 10 and 20.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.867
-Uh, 15.
-Fifteen. Again!

04:23.933 --> 04:24.967
Ready? Watch.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.300
Please count those out loud,
down to the table.

04:28.367 --> 04:32.233
JONATHAN: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

04:32.300 --> 04:34.933
10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.600
-15!
-Fifteen exactly!

04:38.067 --> 04:40.600
JON: Tiny plunger. Tiny plunger.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.533
Now, he just doesn't
understand card quantity.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.967
He understands card identity,

04:46.033 --> 04:48.167
the difference between
one card and another card.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.533
So let me show you what I'm talking about.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.333
If you could just touch
one of those for me, please.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.433
-Just grab it right out.
-PENN: Okay, sure.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.133
Excellent, and, uh, what's gonna happen,

04:55.200 --> 04:56.533
is take the card and show it around.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.833
But I'm gonna have to hide
the plunger so he doesn't see.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.767
Everybody see the card? Yes?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.300
Good. I'm gonna put the plunger back.
Don't let him see.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.500
He tried to look at it.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.167
Yeah, okay. (LAUGHS)
And place it back inside there for me.

05:07.467 --> 05:08.533
Good. Okay.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.433
The tiny plunger will now memorize

05:11.867 --> 05:13.867
the entire deck of cards.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.867
(LAUGHING)

05:17.900 --> 05:19.233
He has done so.

05:20.367 --> 05:23.233
Please whisper the name
of your card to the tiny plunger.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.567
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

05:30.800 --> 05:33.000
Most people just pick it up,
but that was pretty awesome.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.000
But the tiny plunger now
knows what the card is...

05:35.067 --> 05:36.067
I didn't want to touch it.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.700
And he knows the order of the deck,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.300
so he should be able to do the following.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.300
Oh, come on!

05:45.767 --> 05:47.333
JON: Tiny plunger.

05:47.467 --> 05:48.667
I love this act!

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
Thank you!

05:50.133 --> 05:51.133
I love it!

05:51.267 --> 05:53.033
One last time, one last time,
because I don't want you

05:53.100 --> 05:54.133
walking out of here thinking
I'm doing this.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.300
It's not me, it's him.

05:55.367 --> 05:56.367
I know! I know it's him!

05:56.433 --> 05:58.533
Yeah, it's him.
I'm his manager, but nothing else.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.100
So I'll prove it.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.200
If you wouldn't mind, Teller,
please touch a card.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.767
Pick it right out of there. Thank you.

06:04.933 --> 06:07.933
And now, again, I'll hide my
eyes so I can't see anything.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.767
But the plunger's looking right at it.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.600
Oh... Oh, really?

06:11.667 --> 06:13.433
-Yeah.
-Oh.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.033
Oh, yeah, he saw it. Sorry.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.000
Uh, here, hide the plunger
in your hand so he can't see it.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.433
Excellent. And just go ahead

06:19.500 --> 06:21.400
and just reach in there for me
and grab out a new one?

06:21.533 --> 06:22.767
Got it? Excellent.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.000
All right, show that card around
to everybody, and I won't look.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.300
Good, good, good!

06:27.367 --> 06:29.533
Excellent. And, uh...

06:29.600 --> 06:33.100
You could just place it back
inside here wherever you like.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.567
And that's where you wanted it, right?

06:35.633 --> 06:37.400
I'm not changing its location?

06:37.467 --> 06:38.900
I'm not even gonna shuffle.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.267
-May I have it?
-Yeah.

06:42.433 --> 06:43.433
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:44.600 --> 06:49.333
Last time, the plunger
had to be spoken to, to know the card.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.633
You don't speak as much, so this case,

06:51.700 --> 06:53.067
the plunger, yeah, will read your mind.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.367
Hold on... Yeah, go ahead.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.967
Uh, concentrate.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.567
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

06:58.433 --> 06:59.567
Concentrate.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.600
Hold on. Done.

07:03.467 --> 07:04.767
It goes away in about a week.

07:04.833 --> 07:05.867
All right.

07:05.933 --> 07:08.233
Now, he's a sentient plunger.
He knows what he wants.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.833
So, you're gonna do this for me, not me.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.900
The plunger and you
are just gonna go bonk, bonk.

07:12.133 --> 07:16.600
Bonk, bonk. And when you do that, he will
cut, hopefully, back directly to the card.

07:25.033 --> 07:26.333
JON: Tiny plunger.

07:26.433 --> 07:27.533
Thank you very much.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.800
JONATHAN:
That was quite something, wasn't it?

07:32.033 --> 07:33.367
Holy Moly!

07:35.200 --> 07:37.033
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

07:40.833 --> 07:41.833
So...

07:42.433 --> 07:45.100
Here's the cool thing, now. I'm allowed
to sit at the table with the guys,

07:45.167 --> 07:49.000
and I could hear... I could see Penn
just like, uh, amazed by it,

07:49.067 --> 07:50.133
and he was groaning sometimes,

07:50.200 --> 07:51.233
'cause you could see he was getting...

07:51.300 --> 07:53.467
And Teller was laughing at the whole thing
and loving every second of it.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.100
I don't think they have
the faintest idea yet how you did that,

07:56.167 --> 07:57.567
so you're in with a good chance, I think.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.033
-Maybe.
-Can I touch the plunger?

07:59.100 --> 08:00.200
-Yeah, of course!
-Okay.

08:00.267 --> 08:02.133
I'm want to ask the audience,
has anyone ever seen anything

08:02.200 --> 08:04.600
quite that small get such
a big reaction before?

08:06.033 --> 08:08.300
That really was quite something.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.033
Let me ask you something
else about yourself, because...

08:10.100 --> 08:11.200
And this struck a note with me.

08:11.267 --> 08:13.167
You were pretty severely
dyslexic when you were young.

08:13.233 --> 08:15.633
That is very true. I'm still dyslexic.
I'm extremely dyslexic.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.800
My children were both with that as well.

08:16.867 --> 08:17.967
I know it poses a lot of challenges.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.167
Did it help or hinder
the magic in any way?

08:20.233 --> 08:23.500
I think, in some ways,
it obviously hindered it,

08:23.567 --> 08:25.567
because of me reading from books.
It was very hard.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.933
But in some ways, it makes me
think of the world differently,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.133
and that's where weird things
like coming up with a plunger card trick,

08:31.200 --> 08:32.332
-that's all where it came from.
-Yeah.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.067
You know, when one struggles
through something like that,

08:34.133 --> 08:36.500
to come out the other side,
and be as good as somebody as you are,

08:36.567 --> 08:37.866
-that must feel just tremendous.
-Thank you.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.133
Are you ready for me to come to you guys?

08:39.200 --> 08:42.667
Uh, there's supposed
to be suspense at this moment,

08:42.866 --> 08:46.033
but I will say, right off the bat,
you did not fool me.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.533
-JON: Okay.
-But that little plunger did.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.933
But me... Me!

08:51.200 --> 08:53.033
The little plunger fooled me.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.367
I also don't know how to say this
with enough intensity,

08:57.733 --> 09:01.033
but maybe the only

09:01.267 --> 09:04.033
original card trick I've ever seen.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.533
Oh, wow, thank you.
Thank you, thank you. Oh.

09:08.633 --> 09:12.667
And also, the impression you get is,
you don't really touch the cards,

09:12.733 --> 09:14.333
it's the plunger doing all that.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.367
And there's something
so fair and so wonderful

09:17.533 --> 09:20.800
and just so whimsical
about the whole thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.333
The bad news is, about 40 years ago,
I teamed up with this guy.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.567
(LAUGHING) Yeah, right.

09:26.633 --> 09:30.900
And this guy has done very close
to a version of that trick,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.967
and even though it took my breath away,

09:33.033 --> 09:35.600
even though I needed a breather...

09:35.667 --> 09:38.133
Teller actually saw me taking...

09:38.200 --> 09:39.833
Being taken aback,

09:39.900 --> 09:41.633
and my breath being sucked in,

09:41.700 --> 09:45.400
and that gave him a big hint as to how
you put the whole thing together.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.800
Did not fool Teller. I loved this act!

09:47.867 --> 09:49.467
JON: Ah, thank you very much.

09:49.533 --> 09:51.700
Let me step in for just a second, though,

09:51.867 --> 09:53.500
because when Penn was talking,

09:53.567 --> 09:55.167
I noticed you, momentarily...

09:55.233 --> 09:56.667
You shook your head,
and I got the feeling...

09:56.733 --> 09:58.600
Oh, no, no, no, he... They're...
He knows how it works.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.533
I'm just extremely honored.
This is awesome,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.000
and thank you very much for having me on.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.400
Oh, what a great routine!

10:03.800 --> 10:06.067
So you did not fool them,
but thank you so much.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.867
Jon Armstrong and his tiny plunger,
ladies and gentlemen!

10:08.933 --> 10:10.900
-Thank you, Jon.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

10:16.000 --> 10:17.800
Let's meet out next contender.

10:23.033 --> 10:24.033
<i>Bonjour.</i>

10:24.300 --> 10:25.333
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

10:25.433 --> 10:28.133
My name is Xavier Mortimer,
and I'm from France.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.133
I'm so happy to be here in
Las Vegas, the city of magic.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.533
<i>A few years ago,</i>
<i>I was performing in Edinburgh.</i>

10:35.633 --> 10:37.300
In this festival, Cirque du Soleil saw me,

10:37.900 --> 10:41.167
<i>and they asked me if I wanted</i>
<i>to come and perform with them.</i>

10:41.233 --> 10:44.967
And I abandon
all my life that I had in Paris

10:45.033 --> 10:47.667
<i>to join one of the best</i>
<i>company in the world.</i>

10:49.800 --> 10:54.933
<i>I like card tricks and classic magic,</i>
<i>but what I love is showing people</i>

10:55.000 --> 10:57.033
<i>something that they</i>
<i>have never seen before.</i>

10:57.133 --> 11:00.100
<i>More than just fooling,</i>
<i>it's about entertainment.</i>

11:00.167 --> 11:02.100
<i>I like to bring people</i>
<i>to a different world,</i>

11:02.333 --> 11:03.867
<i>without using words,</i>

11:04.067 --> 11:07.767
because movement
and emotion is international.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.333
It's not just about the trick.

11:09.433 --> 11:13.900
At the end of the day, I just want them
to say that they saw something beautiful.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.467
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

11:20.133 --> 11:24.533
Our next performer grew up in Paris,
under the shadow of the real Eiffel Tower,

11:24.633 --> 11:26.967
dreaming of a day he could
perform magic here in Las Vegas,

11:27.067 --> 11:29.067
under the shadow of the fake Eiffel Tower.

11:29.167 --> 11:32.300
Will you join me in saying
<i>bonne chance</i> to Xavier?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.267
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

11:40.200 --> 11:41.833

(BANGING)

11:56.967 --> 11:57.967
Psst!

11:58.633 --> 11:59.700
Psst!

12:02.300 --> 12:03.867
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

12:06.267 --> 12:07.300

Hey! (GASPS)

13:49.533 --> 13:50.700
Hey!

-Boo!
-Ahhh!

14:07.567 --> 14:08.733

Psst!

14:52.833 --> 14:54.167
Hey, psst! Hey, you!

14:55.767 --> 14:56.867
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

14:56.933 --> 14:57.933
No!

14:58.400 --> 14:59.567
(SCREAMING)

15:00.900 --> 15:02.067
(GLASS BREAKING)

15:03.333 --> 15:04.500
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

15:05.367 --> 15:07.433
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

15:10.400 --> 15:12.600
JONATHAN: The fabulous Xavier,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:12.667 --> 15:15.667
How great was that? <i>Magnifique!</i>

15:18.067 --> 15:19.400
We've had performers on stage here,

15:19.467 --> 15:20.833
and I think they're here
performing for us.

15:20.933 --> 15:23.867
Here I felt that we entered
your world, I really did.

15:23.933 --> 15:26.367
It was such a beautiful experience.
What inspires you?

15:26.433 --> 15:28.933
What is it that you're hoping to achieve
when you perform like that?

15:29.333 --> 15:35.000
Um, I was very much inspired
by physical comedy, and like,

15:35.067 --> 15:37.600
you know, Charlie Chaplin,
and this kind of things.

15:37.733 --> 15:42.367
So I tried to put some meanings
and, uh, story in my magic, so...

15:42.433 --> 15:44.000
It's a little bit of reward, yes.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.600
Well, let's go over to Penn, right now.

15:45.967 --> 15:50.033
A lot of people
don't know that film was really...

15:50.167 --> 15:54.400
Really pushed forward
by mostly French magicians.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.067
I mean, they were...
They were big on that.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.633
And you've continued that
with a great film-to-life.

15:58.833 --> 16:02.533
Yeah. I was very inspired
by Georges Méliès. I love his work.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.200
And if we had any doubt
about you truly being French,

16:05.267 --> 16:06.467
you proved it with the music.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.967
There's no doubt that,
that was French music.

16:10.033 --> 16:14.733
What you've also done
is just a classic storytelling fantasy,

16:14.900 --> 16:20.067
working all the way through,
and a film-to-life with an updated...

16:20.333 --> 16:22.900
And a very nice and, uh...

16:23.033 --> 16:25.433
Extensive handling

16:25.500 --> 16:28.767
of a daylight séance gimmick,
which you use beautifully.

16:28.867 --> 16:33.100
Just a wonderful, wonderful routine
that I just loved all the way through.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.200
So with Penn using those
phrases like "daylight séance,"

16:39.267 --> 16:41.767
which doesn't really mean
anything to the rest of us,

16:41.833 --> 16:43.667
but I guess you guys
are on the same page here.

16:43.733 --> 16:46.033
-They know what you were doing?
-Of course.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.200
(LAUGHING)

16:47.267 --> 16:50.167
So you didn't fool them,
but you gave us a great time.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.700
Xavier, ladies and gentlemen!

16:52.967 --> 16:54.800
Thank you, Xavier. Congratulations.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.133
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

16:58.800 --> 17:02.167
For my own bit of magic,
watch as I conjure up our next contender.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.800
My name is Greg Dow.
I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada,

17:08.867 --> 17:11.400
and I'm a magician
that performs at corporate events,

17:11.467 --> 17:13.500
trade shows, and private parties.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.433
<i>I love close-up magic the best.</i>

17:15.532 --> 17:17.500
<i>I love seeing the look on people's faces</i>

17:17.567 --> 17:20.133
<i>when the magic happens</i>
<i>right in front of them.</i>

17:21.233 --> 17:25.367
<i>The thing about doing magic at corporate</i>
<i>events is, it's all very safe.</i>

17:26.267 --> 17:28.833
<i>Magic for people in suits and ties.</i>

17:29.367 --> 17:32.500
You have to make sure
you don't offend anyone.

17:32.567 --> 17:35.900
But sometimes,
the real me needs to come out.

17:36.233 --> 17:37.933
<i>So, I put on a mask,</i>

17:38.000 --> 17:42.100
<i>not to hide my identity,</i>
<i>but to unleash it!</i>

17:42.667 --> 17:45.867
And that's when I become The Shocker!

17:49.500 --> 17:51.733
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:52.967 --> 17:55.067
How brave of this next magician,

17:55.133 --> 17:58.333
performing right after his secret
identity was revealed to all of us.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.067
Please welcome my hero, The Shocker!

18:03.200 --> 18:06.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I am The Shocker!

18:06.833 --> 18:10.267
And that's what it looks like
when Spider-Man has alone time.

18:12.100 --> 18:17.433
I'm the world's best, and only,
pro-wrestling magician.

18:18.167 --> 18:20.900
Which means I'm the guy that's
gonna pretend to kick your ass

18:20.967 --> 18:23.567
as I pretend to do Harry Potter stuff.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.300
And this is a good-looking
audience tonight.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.367
-You guys are attractive!
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

18:30.967 --> 18:34.033
I'm gonna take the mask off
just so I can see you guys better.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.033
So tonight I am going
to attempt to read the minds

18:41.133 --> 18:43.000
of some of the members
of the audience here.

18:43.067 --> 18:46.067
Now, normally when I do this,
I have a tag-team partner,

18:46.133 --> 18:48.833
someone who knows
my every thought before I think it,

18:48.900 --> 18:50.567
my every move before I make it.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.533
Unfortunately,
he could not be here tonight.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.600
So instead, I brought
his mask along with me.

18:59.033 --> 19:03.667
Now, this mask was made
from the tiger that bit Roy.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.767
JONATHAN (CHUCKLING): Ooh.

19:05.933 --> 19:08.033
You hate that,
you're gonna hate my new rug.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.600
Now, I'm gonna toss this mask
out into the audience to a gentleman.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.300
He is gonna place it upon his head.

19:14.367 --> 19:17.367
That will allow me to have
a mental connection with this guy.

19:17.433 --> 19:20.167
I'm gonna go completely random here.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.867
Place the mask on, you'll get
the giant-est round of applause

19:24.933 --> 19:26.533
you've ever received in your life!

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:31.567 --> 19:32.900
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.933
I'm gonna ask you a question.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.100
You're gonna send me the answer
using the power of your mind.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.567
I'm gonna write it down.
We're gonna see how it went.

19:40.633 --> 19:44.267
Jonathan, if you would,
document our progress.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.800
-My pleasure.
-Perfect!

19:46.300 --> 19:51.133
Sir, if you would,
I want you to think of the name

19:51.433 --> 19:54.400
of a woman that is important in your life.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.633
But I don't want it to be
your mom or your sister,

19:58.067 --> 19:59.967
because I want it to be one I don't know.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.500
Oh!

20:02.267 --> 20:03.433
Shocker!

20:05.500 --> 20:06.667
Do you have the name?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.267
-Yes.
-Send it to me

20:08.333 --> 20:09.933
using the power of your mind.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.367
That's a pretty name. All right.
(GRUNTING)

20:14.800 --> 20:16.433
I'm gonna lock that down

20:16.933 --> 20:20.400
into envelope number one.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.300
Just like that, you guys
can see it going in.

20:23.367 --> 20:27.100
Let's peel this safety seal off.
That is locked in.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.833
For the first time,
for our record-keeper Jonathan,

20:30.033 --> 20:32.533
what is the name of the woman
you were thinking of?

20:32.867 --> 20:34.467
-Donna.
-Donna!

20:34.567 --> 20:35.933
-Donna.
-Please write down Donna.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Donna.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.233
Take the mask.

20:38.533 --> 20:41.200
Toss it behind you to a young lady.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.767
There you go!
This young lady right here!

20:44.667 --> 20:47.633
You're gonna place the mask on your head,

20:47.833 --> 20:51.233
and I'm going to attempt
to read your mind.

20:51.867 --> 20:56.667
I want you to think of your
favorite thing to do with a man.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.467
(LAUGHTER)

20:59.100 --> 21:00.533
Send it to me.

21:02.567 --> 21:05.067
Interesting! All right.

21:05.933 --> 21:10.033
I am going to write down
what you have sent me,

21:10.333 --> 21:14.533
lock it in to envelope number two.

21:15.467 --> 21:19.667
Now, what do you like to do with a man?

21:19.933 --> 21:22.067
-Wrestle!
-SHOCKER: Wrestle!

21:22.533 --> 21:23.533
(APPLAUSE)

21:25.700 --> 21:26.800
JONATHAN: Well.

21:26.867 --> 21:30.267
Not what he was hoping
you were going to say, by the way.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.200
Toss the mask back up here, or give
it a little conga line on its way up.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.633
There we go, it's gonna toss...
It's gonna come over the...

21:37.067 --> 21:38.300
Perfect!

21:39.500 --> 21:41.133
(LAUGHTER)

21:42.067 --> 21:44.867
Now, since this is a magic competition...

21:46.367 --> 21:49.900
By Vegas law, I have to do
something with a deck of cards.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.533
So I'm gonna write down
what I think is going to happen

21:54.167 --> 21:55.867
with the cards here.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.633
Perfect! I have locked that in...

22:02.133 --> 22:04.133
To envelope number three.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.767
All the way in, sealed up.

22:07.733 --> 22:10.200
In there. I'm gonna
come out to Penn and Teller.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.233
If you would please, Teller,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.367
select a card.

22:17.133 --> 22:18.167
Perfect!

22:18.333 --> 22:21.167
For the first time, so Jonathan
can write it down, Teller,

22:21.233 --> 22:23.200
out loud, what card did you pick?

22:24.367 --> 22:27.700
Let me try that again.
Penn, for the first time,

22:27.767 --> 22:29.867
out loud for Jonathan,
what card did he pick?

22:30.533 --> 22:32.233
The three of clubs.

22:32.300 --> 22:33.367
JONATHAN: Three of clubs.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.167
Um...

22:36.267 --> 22:37.500
What was it again?

22:37.567 --> 22:39.167
PENN: The three of clubs.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.300
SHOCKER: Three of clubs.

22:41.133 --> 22:42.600
The end might suck.

22:44.267 --> 22:45.767
Let's take a look, though.
Let's go.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.400
First, we went to this guy right here,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.800
asked him the name
of a woman important in his life.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.467
Locked it into envelope number one.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.600
You said the name.
What did he say, Jonathan?

22:54.667 --> 22:55.700
He said Donna.

22:55.767 --> 22:58.033
Donna, and I wrote down the name.

22:58.733 --> 22:59.900
-Donna!
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

23:02.433 --> 23:05.067
And then we went to this young
lady right here,

23:05.133 --> 23:07.433
asked her favorite thing to do with a man.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.200
Locked it in envelope number two!

23:09.267 --> 23:11.133
She said she likes to...

23:11.200 --> 23:13.300
-Wrestle!
-She likes to wrestle.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.833
And I wrote down
that she likes to wrestle!

23:17.967 --> 23:19.433
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

23:19.900 --> 23:23.133
And then, we went to Penn and Teller.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.300
PENN: Yes.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.867
You picked the three of clubs.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.833
Locked my prediction
into envelope number three.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
I wrote down the, um...

23:34.367 --> 23:35.433
Eight of diamonds.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.767
-AUDIENCE: Aw.
-Aw.

23:39.633 --> 23:41.633
Now, this is where it gets a little weird.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.933
I'm not sure how you messed that one up.

23:45.367 --> 23:46.700
(LAUGHTER)

23:46.933 --> 23:49.167
Because every card I gave you

23:50.067 --> 23:52.267
was the damn eight of diamonds!

23:53.800 --> 23:55.367
So how about,

23:55.533 --> 23:58.767
instead of you picking the wrong card,

23:59.800 --> 24:01.133
I fix the prediction

24:02.300 --> 24:03.933
to match the card you picked?

24:05.133 --> 24:06.233
Three of clubs?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.100
Three of clubs!

24:08.667 --> 24:10.400
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING)
Shocker! Shocker! Shocker!

24:10.467 --> 24:12.967
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm The Shocker! Thank you!

24:13.133 --> 24:14.467
And good night!

24:15.733 --> 24:17.533
JONATHAN: The Shocker,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:17.733 --> 24:20.200
What a great finish.
Great style as well.

24:20.433 --> 24:24.100
Earlier, we saw you in your
Greg persona, the corporate magician.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.433
Now we're meeting The Shocker.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.967
The two personalities, they ever
get mixed up, do they ever clash on stage?

24:29.333 --> 24:32.467
Well, Greg had this girlfriend once...

24:32.567 --> 24:33.833
(LAUGHING)

24:34.900 --> 24:36.500
Are you ready to give us your verdict?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.967
The Shocker!

24:38.933 --> 24:42.600
Boy, I just love acts
that go right to the edge there.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.533
I will tell you, um,

24:44.600 --> 24:47.533
with changing from the eight of diamonds

24:47.600 --> 24:50.667
to the three of clubs,
you were one ahead of us there.

24:50.733 --> 24:53.033
But, I also will just say

24:53.467 --> 24:56.100
you probably don't want us to handle

24:56.467 --> 24:58.333
that prediction at the end.
Is that right?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.533
Well, I'm gonna say this.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.333
You're on the right track,
and you can finish that thought,

25:04.633 --> 25:07.533
or you can have the best damn
opening act you've ever had.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.167
(LAUGHTER)

25:09.533 --> 25:11.200
What do you guys think?

25:11.567 --> 25:14.633
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING)
Shocker! Shocker! Shocker!

25:16.100 --> 25:17.933
Are you happy?
You're confident that they kind of know

25:18.000 --> 25:19.133
what they're talking about there?

25:19.200 --> 25:20.833
I'm pretty sure these are smart guys here.

25:20.900 --> 25:23.733
So they've got it down.
But what a great performance.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.900
Wasn't he awesome, ladies and gentlemen?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.067
Let's hear it again for The Shocker!

25:29.200 --> 25:31.200
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING)
Shocker! Shocker! Shocker!

25:32.767 --> 25:35.433
So now let's learn
all about our next trickster.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.267
<i>Hi. My name is Steven Brundage.</i>
<i>I grew up in Brooklyn,</i>

25:42.333 --> 25:44.633
<i>but I currently live</i>
<i>in Saratoga Springs, New York.</i>

25:44.733 --> 25:46.433
Who here can actually solve
a Rubik's Cube?

25:46.500 --> 25:49.433
When I was a kid, I got a Rubik's Cube,
and I basically locked myself in a room

25:49.533 --> 25:50.867
<i>and I started to learn how to solve it.</i>

25:51.567 --> 25:54.600
<i>So I was doing magic for two years</i>
<i>full-time to make ends meet,</i>

25:54.667 --> 25:56.267
and then I had a viral video take off.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.633
<i>I was driving from a gig.</i>
<i>I got pulled over.</i>

25:58.867 --> 26:01.333
<i>I told the officer I was a magician,</i>

26:01.400 --> 26:02.933
so he asked to see a trick.

26:03.233 --> 26:05.133
<i>From mixed up, in one hand,</i>
<i>and behind the back.</i>

26:06.967 --> 26:08.500
<i>When I catch it again, take a look.</i>

26:08.567 --> 26:10.100
POLICEMAN: <i>Holy</i> (BEEP)

26:10.167 --> 26:13.067
The viral video took off.
I got 15 million views total.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.667
<i>Since then, things have kind of taken off,</i>

26:14.733 --> 26:17.333
<i>and I'm actually traveling</i>
<i>across the country to do gigs now.</i>

26:17.733 --> 26:18.833
(LAUGHING) Yes!

26:19.533 --> 26:21.567
I have a girlfriend now,
and she's kind of out of my league,

26:21.667 --> 26:22.867
but I think the magic helps a little bit.

26:22.933 --> 26:24.433
<i>I'm really excited to be on</i> Penn &amp; Teller.

26:24.533 --> 26:26.967
<i>Who knew so much could</i>
<i>happen from having a viral video?</i>

26:30.800 --> 26:33.267
Our next performer cut his
teeth as a street performer,

26:33.333 --> 26:34.933
so you might want
to get your loose change handy

26:35.000 --> 26:37.333
in case he passes around the hat
after what he's doing now.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.300
Please welcome Steven Brundage!

26:39.467 --> 26:41.467
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

26:41.867 --> 26:43.533
Hi. Thank you so much for having me.

26:43.633 --> 26:46.500
Uh, I'm gonna do something
really awesome with two Rubik's Cubes.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.167
Um, I've always loved to solve it,

26:48.367 --> 26:49.867
but I'm gonna try something
with Penn and Teller.

26:49.933 --> 26:51.300
Can you guys join me up on stage, please?

26:51.367 --> 26:52.467
Thank you so much.

26:52.733 --> 26:53.733
(APPLAUSE)

26:54.900 --> 26:55.967
Nice meeting you.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.500
Nice to meet you, as well.
Thank you so much.

26:59.567 --> 27:00.700
Perfect. So we'll get started.

27:00.767 --> 27:01.967
So, Penn, I'm gonna need your help first.

27:02.033 --> 27:03.367
-We have two Rubik's Cubes.
-Okay.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.800
You can choose either one to mix up.
Your choice. It doesn't matter.

27:05.867 --> 27:08.100
-I'll take that one.
-Perfect. I want you to mix it up.

27:08.233 --> 27:10.600
Just like a deck of cards
is similar to a Rubik's Cube

27:10.667 --> 27:13.533
in the fashion that it takes seven
shuffles with a deck of cards

27:13.600 --> 27:15.033
before it's thoroughly randomized.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.233
A Rubik's Cube is actually 20 moves.

27:17.467 --> 27:19.867
So I want you to start to turn
and twist it up for me, please.

27:19.933 --> 27:22.567
And any time you want,
I want you to say the word, "Stop."

27:22.633 --> 27:24.700
When you say stop,
we're both gonna stop mixing for me.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.867
Okay.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.800
(LAUGHTER)

27:30.333 --> 27:31.333
Stop!

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
-Right there.
-Yeah.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.067
Perfect. I'll take it back.
You said stop,

27:34.133 --> 27:37.200
and we both stopped mixing up
the Rubik's Cubes at the same, exact time.

27:37.267 --> 27:38.833
Teller, do you mind
helping me out next, please?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.167
Perfect. So we have two cubes here.

27:41.233 --> 27:42.567
I want you to choose either one.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.267
Go for it.
Whichever one you choose,

27:44.500 --> 27:45.800
you're gonna hold it in your hand,

27:45.867 --> 27:47.767
and when you open up,
it's gonna be solved.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.033
Perfect.
So cover it up for me.

27:53.067 --> 27:54.133
Perfect. Watch.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.467
It's now solved.
Take a look.

27:59.533 --> 28:00.700
Is it solved?

28:01.300 --> 28:02.633
That would have been amazing, though.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.933
It would have been great, yeah.

28:04.967 --> 28:07.733
Can you picture the Rubik's Cube
one move away from being solved?

28:07.967 --> 28:09.033
Uh, barely.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.333
Barely. I'll give you a hint.
So that's basically one move away.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.867
There's two, three, four...
The more you mix it up,

28:13.967 --> 28:15.367
the harder the patterns on the cube

28:15.433 --> 28:16.667
-are gonna be to recognize.
-Right.

28:16.733 --> 28:20.133
We're gonna mix it up to about
20 moves away, then go back in time.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.000
So picture the Rubik's Cube
at 20 moves away.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.467
Imagine in your mind

28:23.533 --> 28:27.367
if the Rubik's Cube is maybe only
10 moves away from being mixed up.

28:27.433 --> 28:29.733
Picture at seven
what you're gonna see with the cube.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
Imagine if the Rubik's Cube
is only one move away,

28:31.867 --> 28:33.900
then finally, in your mind,
when it's completely solved,

28:33.967 --> 28:35.000
let me know when you see it.

28:35.067 --> 28:37.000
-It's completely solved.
-Just like that?

28:37.233 --> 28:38.767
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

28:40.267 --> 28:43.467
Yeah, that was good, but this time,
I'm actually gonna solve the Rubik's Cube.

28:43.533 --> 28:45.900
This time, I'm gonna use
a paper bag that I have down here.

28:47.033 --> 28:48.967
I want you to watch
all the different sides of the cube.

28:49.033 --> 28:50.967
You can see there's no patterns
or big blocks on the cube,

28:51.033 --> 28:52.367
so you know it's thoroughly mixed up.

28:52.433 --> 28:54.167
I want you to watch.
We're gonna place it in the bag.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.067
This is the coolest part of the show.

28:56.367 --> 28:57.633
Is it still mixed up in there?

28:57.733 --> 28:59.667
-Uh, yes, it is.
-Still mixed up. Still mixed up?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.067
Watch.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.533
It's now solved.

29:03.733 --> 29:05.333
Well, that's great.
I don't believe you.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.167
You don't. Okay.
No, I'll prove it. Hands empty.

29:07.233 --> 29:09.267
I want you to watch.
As slowly as possible.

29:09.667 --> 29:12.967
That is one solved Rubik's Cube
and one empty bag.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.467
-Thank you.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

29:20.033 --> 29:21.400
Now, here's the thing.
As a kid,

29:21.467 --> 29:23.600
I used to actually go
to these speed-solving competitions,

29:23.667 --> 29:26.333
and I would sit there and I would
always race, but I could never win,

29:26.433 --> 29:27.667
so I had to cheat.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.867
Is that still mixed up on all those sides?

29:30.033 --> 29:32.700
Perfect. Now, if I turn it one time,
it's still gonna be mixed up.

29:32.867 --> 29:35.833
The cheating move happens the moment
you toss it in the air like that.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.833
-Completely solved.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

29:38.200 --> 29:39.433
Thank you.

29:42.033 --> 29:44.800
Yeah, I got so good at cheating,
I'm actually gonna do that same move,

29:44.867 --> 29:47.100
but twice as hard.
I'm gonna do it one-handed.

29:47.167 --> 29:48.900
I'm gonna toss it behind my back.

29:49.067 --> 29:53.100
When I catch it, you're gonna see
every single color on its original side.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.033
Watch close.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.400
One-handed.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.100
Behind the back.
Completely solved.

30:00.567 --> 30:01.567
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

30:05.933 --> 30:07.333
Now, here's the thing
with the Rubik's Cube.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.067
The more you play with it,
the better and better you get with it.

30:10.133 --> 30:13.667
So, I actually got down
to a millisecond while cheating.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.167
So I'm gonna show you
the millisecond version.

30:15.300 --> 30:16.900
I want you to watch all those sides.

30:16.967 --> 30:19.267
If you actually blink,
you're gonna miss it.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
(BLOWS)

30:21.200 --> 30:22.700
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

30:25.700 --> 30:27.000
Now, to be honest...

30:29.167 --> 30:30.900
This is me solving
the cube over and over again.

30:30.967 --> 30:32.467
I said I was gonna do it
in Teller's hand, and I am.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.100
Hold it in your hands for me, please.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.767
Cover it up right there. Watch.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.600
We'll try to get it to work.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.800
Like that. It should be solved.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.367
See, I didn't say what the solution
was this time.

30:47.433 --> 30:48.733
See, the solution

30:49.600 --> 30:52.167
was to get these two Rubik's Cubes

30:52.367 --> 30:55.800
to match completely perfectly.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.767
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

31:01.467 --> 31:04.667
Now, one side is pretty good.
Better than one side,

31:04.767 --> 31:06.800
would be side number two,

31:07.067 --> 31:10.067
side number three, side number four,

31:10.433 --> 31:14.733
five, and all six sides
a completely perfect match.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.367
-Thank you, my friends.
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

31:18.900 --> 31:20.467
Steven Brundage, ladies and gentlemen.

31:20.533 --> 31:22.167
How awesome was that?

31:22.467 --> 31:25.400
Gentlemen, once again,
you can deliberate over there.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
PENN: No.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.067
-You want to stay up here?
-Yeah.

31:28.133 --> 31:29.200
Okay.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.400
Doesn't take long to say
"You fooled us," does it?

31:31.533 --> 31:34.233
Wow! That's it?
As simple as that?

31:34.633 --> 31:36.400
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.333
Teller, would you like to do the honors?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.700
Steven Brundage, ladies and gentlemen.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.567
He fooled 'em! Did an awesome job.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.767
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:49.300 --> 31:51.633
Now, after a night of figuring out
how other tricks work,

31:51.700 --> 31:53.000
it's time to see them do one of their own.

31:53.067 --> 31:56.333
Here now to perform one of their
own incredible, world-famous illusions,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.333
those twin titans of trickery.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.567
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

31:59.633 --> 32:01.067
-it's Penn and Teller!
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

32:01.133 --> 32:03.667
Thank you, Jonathan.
Thank you, Jonathan.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.833
Now, before we start the trick proper,
this is important.

32:07.967 --> 32:11.967
Would you all right now,
please, take out your cell phones

32:12.167 --> 32:14.267
and turn them on?

32:14.533 --> 32:16.267
And turn your ringers up full.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.467
We want you all loud and connected.

32:19.567 --> 32:21.900
We're gonna choose
one of you as a cell phone,

32:21.967 --> 32:25.100
and invite you to our stage
and video our first trick

32:25.200 --> 32:28.500
from an angle that will show you
how that trick is done.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.333
Now, Teller's vetting people.

32:30.533 --> 32:34.867
Because you need to have someone
who has video capabilities on their phone

32:35.033 --> 32:38.767
and knows how to use
those video capabilities.

32:38.833 --> 32:42.367
Teller's found someone
who knows how to use his cell phone.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.667
Right up here, please.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.267
And what is your name, my newest friend?

32:46.333 --> 32:48.133
-Jay.
-Hello, Jay, my name is Penn.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.767
Nice to meet you.
Got your cell phone there?

32:49.867 --> 32:52.467
Have someone in your party that
knows your cell phone number there, Jay?

32:52.533 --> 32:53.667
-I do.
-And who's that, Jay?

32:53.733 --> 32:55.367
-Tammy.
-Tammy. Who's Tammy to you, Jay?

32:55.433 --> 32:57.500
-My wife.
-Tammy, call Jay, would you, please?

32:57.567 --> 32:59.433
Let it keep ringing.
Don't hang up no matter what.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.933
Want y'all to memorize that ring tone.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.033
Gonna hold it to my microphone right here.

33:04.167 --> 33:05.300
Memorize this.

33:05.367 --> 33:07.700
The old kind of bell telephone
ring right there.

33:07.833 --> 33:10.767
And, um, oh, you got a picture.
Very nice picture of you there.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.733
-Hello, Tammy.
-Hi, Penn.

33:12.833 --> 33:14.467
Hey, uh, Tammy?

33:15.167 --> 33:16.200
What are you wearing?

33:16.267 --> 33:19.767
Never mind, never mind, never mind!
Gonna put this in video mode.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.833
Gonna made a little video for you
and we're rolling right there. Here we go.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.867
Stand right where you are, okay, Jay?
Here we go.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.333
Good evening! My name is Penn Jillette.
That's my partner Teller,

33:27.400 --> 33:31.633
and <i>Fool Us</i> and Jonathan Ross
are proud to present Jay!

33:31.700 --> 33:33.633
Yeah, give it for him! Give it up for him!

33:34.333 --> 33:36.400
Oh, look at that.
There is Tammy, right there.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.333
They love their Jay.

33:38.567 --> 33:39.900
And strike a pose!

33:40.433 --> 33:41.933
Now, Jay, we have video of you.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.867
We have video of the audience.
We have video of us.

33:43.933 --> 33:49.567
But as of yet, no video of you onstage
with a famous Las Vegas magician!

33:51.067 --> 33:52.900
We're gonna rectify that right now.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.300
If you don't recognize him, all you got
to do is add a little bit of junk jewelry,

33:56.500 --> 33:58.800
and you should know right away, of course,

33:58.867 --> 34:01.967
that is Criss Angel right there.
Look at that!

34:02.567 --> 34:06.800
You can tell it's Criss.
Ripped off anarchy symbol across the abs.

34:06.867 --> 34:10.833
We have Criss, we have Jay,
and our wonderful Las Vegas audience.

34:10.933 --> 34:13.733
Right there. Right there. Right there.
That's a good shot of you.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.167
Jay, get a shot of you walking.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.233
Right forward, right about to that line.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.632
Stand right forward.

34:19.699 --> 34:21.233
Face forward.
Lights will be focused on you.

34:21.367 --> 34:23.733
Gonna do a sweep pan
right over here, pick up this cup.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.333
The cup is clean and dry on the inside.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.800
Open that up, would you, please, Jay?
I want to get an overhead shot.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.033
-Is that clean and dry in there, Jay?
-Yes, it is.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.067
-We'll put your phone right in there, Jay.
-All right.

34:33.132 --> 34:35.333
Now, Jay, when you're watching
this back, there's not a lot to see.

34:35.933 --> 34:39.300
We're doing high-def video
of the inside of a white cup.

34:39.367 --> 34:40.500
Little bit monotonous.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.100
But the sound is great.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.199
If you want to try this at home,
put your phone in a cup.

34:44.266 --> 34:45.867
The microphone's
at the bottom of the phone,

34:45.933 --> 34:48.867
so the whole cup
becomes this organic reverb unit.

34:49.033 --> 34:51.900
Makes the mid-range really fat,
makes your vocals sound great.

34:52.033 --> 34:55.333
To make it sound a little funkier,
you can put this right on there, Jay.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.400
Somebody's bouncing off
the plucky little phone...

34:57.467 --> 34:58.967
Almost dropped it on you, Jay! Sorry.

34:59.033 --> 35:00.933
We'll just focus right on that phone.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.467
Put all your energy there, Jay.

35:02.533 --> 35:06.833
All those emails, those texts,
those videos, those photos from Tammy.

35:06.900 --> 35:10.533
You know, so much of our lives
are on those phones, aren't they, Jay?

35:10.600 --> 35:15.000
So much of our memories,
our thoughts, our ideas, even our hearts.

35:15.100 --> 35:17.767
We've made them
very powerful magical objects,

35:17.833 --> 35:22.067
and we want the <i>Fool Us</i> audience
to get a lot of magic out of that phone.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.567
So you're gonna put a lot of magic in.
Put the magic in, Jay!

35:24.633 --> 35:27.400
Put the magic in the phone!
Put the magic in the phone, Jay!

35:27.467 --> 35:28.600
Put the magic in the phone!

35:28.700 --> 35:31.567
And <i>mazel tov!</i>

35:32.700 --> 35:33.767
Nice.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.600
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

35:39.133 --> 35:40.400
You know, Jay,

35:40.467 --> 35:43.067
when I can't find my phone,
I do what everyone does.

35:43.167 --> 35:44.833
-Have somebody I know give it a call.
-Yeah.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.167
And then all my friends,
when you listen for the ring tone,

35:47.233 --> 35:48.467
try to triangulate,

35:48.600 --> 35:51.367
and you'd be amazed the unusual places

35:51.433 --> 35:53.833
we found my phone there, Jay.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.300
Here's what we're gonna do.
No matter where you're seated,

35:56.433 --> 35:57.933
anywhere in the auditorium,

35:58.367 --> 36:01.200
listen for Jay's ringtone from Tammy.

36:01.267 --> 36:04.000
The old bell telephone regular ring there.

36:04.067 --> 36:06.700
When you hear it,
no matter where you're seated, right away,

36:06.833 --> 36:09.867
point to where it sounds
to you like it's coming from.

36:09.933 --> 36:11.300
Tammy, call your husband.

36:11.367 --> 36:13.533
Call right now.
Everybody listen, everybody point.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.133
-(RINGING)
-I hear it, I hear it! Just point to it!

36:16.233 --> 36:17.900
I hear it.
Everybody point to it.

36:18.033 --> 36:22.000
It's coming from
that very well-lit woman, right there,

36:22.067 --> 36:23.567
pointing behind her in the blue.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.300
-(RINGING CONTINUES)
-You have Jay's phone on you?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.800
-No.
-Do me a favor.

36:26.867 --> 36:28.833
Spread your legs as wide as you can,

36:30.300 --> 36:32.867
and reach all the way under your chair.
Reach under your chair.

36:32.967 --> 36:34.700
Ma'am, look under your chair.

36:35.167 --> 36:37.000
First of all, find your ass,

36:37.933 --> 36:39.633
-and reach directly under it.
-(LAUGHTER)

36:39.700 --> 36:41.067
Pull out anything that's under here.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.667
There's a big box
under one of your chairs, there.

36:43.767 --> 36:48.200
Astonishing how long it took us
to find something that big, isn't it?

36:49.133 --> 36:51.100
Would you hand that
to the row in front of you, please?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.200
Keep moving it until it gets to
someone on the aisle.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.433
Maybe you should stand up,
bring that box up here.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.867
Wonderful, thank you so much.

36:57.633 --> 37:00.233
And hand that to Jay, would you, please?

37:00.933 --> 37:02.300
Oh, thank you so much.

37:02.367 --> 37:05.167
And, Jay, what does it say
on that box there?

37:05.267 --> 37:06.800
It says food and wine.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.867
Is that box sealed shut all the way around
with a piece of tape? Check it out.

37:09.967 --> 37:11.033
-Yeah.
-Is it sealed?

37:11.100 --> 37:12.933
Peel that tape off, would you please, Jay?

37:13.500 --> 37:15.600
When you get
all the tape off the box, Jay,

37:15.767 --> 37:19.900
lift the top off the box and tell us
what's inside that sealed box, Jay!

37:20.400 --> 37:21.667
-Fish.
-A fish!

37:21.733 --> 37:25.600
-Nice!
-It's a dead fish packed in ice.

37:26.067 --> 37:27.900
Bring your nose over here, Jay.
I need your nose.

37:27.967 --> 37:29.400
-Okay.
-Bring your nose over here.

37:29.467 --> 37:31.867
And, Jay, take a whiff on us,
would you please, Jay?

37:31.933 --> 37:32.967
Take a whiff on us.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.433
Make sure that it's indeed a real fish.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.133
-Is that a real fish, Jay?
-Yeah, that's... That's real. Yeah.

37:37.267 --> 37:39.133
Jay, take the microphone right there.
Hold that microphone

37:39.200 --> 37:41.800
right above the fish's gills.
Hold it right there.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.600
Hold it still. Tammy!
Call Jay, would you, please?

37:44.733 --> 37:45.967
Hear a few things.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.467
Hear that fish's head being cut off?

37:49.133 --> 37:51.667
Hear the guts spilling out of the fish?

37:52.167 --> 37:55.733
But deep inside the bowels of the tilapia,

37:56.167 --> 37:57.967
you're gonna hear what Jay hears,

37:58.300 --> 37:59.667
when Tammy gives him a call.

37:59.733 --> 38:02.100
-(RINGING)
-Is that inside the fish?

38:02.467 --> 38:04.333
-Is it inside the fish, Jay?
-It certainly is.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.867
You should be able to see
a picture of Tammy covered in fish guts.

38:06.933 --> 38:08.367
-I did.
-You see that right there, Jay?

38:08.433 --> 38:10.300
-I do, yeah.
-Answer that as quickly as you can,

38:10.367 --> 38:11.900
-would you please, Jay?
-(RINGING)

38:12.867 --> 38:14.633
-Hi, dear.
-Hey, babe.

38:14.867 --> 38:15.867
JAY: How are you?

38:15.933 --> 38:17.100
-Is that Tammy, Jay?
-That is.

38:17.167 --> 38:18.700
-Is that your phone?
-That is.

38:18.967 --> 38:20.833
-Thank you so much, Jay.
-Thank you so much.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.800
-Watch your step, there. Watch your step.
-Thank you.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.933
That's Jay! That's Tammy!

38:25.000 --> 38:26.667
I'm Penn! This is Teller.

38:26.733 --> 38:29.100
We're <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us</i>
and Jonathan Ross.

38:29.167 --> 38:30.467
Penn and Teller, ladies and gentlemen!

38:30.533 --> 38:32.400
-Wow, that was fabulous!
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

38:32.767 --> 38:35.233
No idea.
No one could bust that one.

38:35.300 --> 38:38.700
That's our show for tonight. Join us again
next week for more foolers and more fun.

38:38.767 --> 38:41.267
For Penn and Teller, I'm Jonathan Ross.
Good night, everybody.
