01:03.834 --> 01:09.124
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR

01:46.375 --> 01:50.791
TeIl her what you got. - MaIe,
Caucasian, appears to have been shot.

01:51.375 --> 01:54.875
Where? - In his room.
- Very funny, HaroId.

01:55.292 --> 01:59.833
The wound is just beIow the heart.
- Shot once? - Seems to have been.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.040
Turner ...?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.541
Dr. Lappe, l'm sure he's going to be
here any second now. - ReaIly?

02:14.876 --> 02:17.541
Mr. Turner is late again.

02:34.041 --> 02:37.332
Let's get back to work.
- We can do that in five minutes.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.958
You know what Joey would say?
- Come on!

02:42.834 --> 02:46.249
What kind of a slug?
- You're missing the point.

02:46.709 --> 02:52.583
The machine wilI come back with a
rephrase. - What do we feed in?

03:54.792 --> 03:59.124
Turner, Joseph. - 1 7 minutes Iate.
- Make it 1 2, there was a headwind.

03:59.625 --> 04:03.791
Dr. Lappe, anything in the
earIy pouch for me?

04:04.417 --> 04:05.499
Dr. Lappe?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.833
Nothing in response to your report.

04:08.333 --> 04:13.249
Please analyze the book on your desk
by 4 o'cIock. - Yes, sir.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.624
I'd move the Tolmiea to the light,

04:17.125 --> 04:19.249
the leaves are getting a blight.

04:21.750 --> 04:26.040
At ease, Sarge, at ease.
It's going to rain today, at 1 0:20.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.082
There must be more details.
- I only read two chapters.

04:33.584 --> 04:36.583
No other clues?
- What time did they find him?

04:37.083 --> 04:41.583
Doesn't say. Just early evening.
- They never said what caIiber.

04:42.083 --> 04:45.166
Apparently a .38.
- Why "apparently?"

04:45.667 --> 04:49.791
The entry wound was characteristic of
a .38, but the sIug wasn't recovered.

04:50.292 --> 04:54.708
Hey, we're getting somewhere.
- You guys figure it out.

04:55.208 --> 04:58.166
l have Far East journaIs to read.
- Was the slug in the waIl?

04:58.500 --> 05:01.207
No, there was no exit wound.

05:01.709 --> 05:04.791
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.791
Hi. What we've got so far ...

05:11.292 --> 05:12.666
Ice.

05:13.167 --> 05:15.666
lnstead of Iead. lce.

05:16.333 --> 05:20.624
The murderer pours water into a .38
caliber mold and freezes it.

05:21.876 --> 05:26.624
He shoots the guy with the ice buIlet.
The cops find a few drops of water.

05:27.125 --> 05:30.374
No bulIet, no baIlistics.
- That's great!

05:34.041 --> 05:35.374
What is this?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.249
Beautiful caIligraphy.
- What is it? - It means heaven.

05:42.125 --> 05:47.499
Nothing eIse? - It can mean
"the best" or "tops". Why?

05:49.750 --> 05:54.082
l'm not sure. - We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

05:54.584 --> 05:57.124
TaIk to Sam about it.
- About this?

05:57.625 --> 06:01.624
I did. He said, "that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

06:02.125 --> 06:05.499
Which means he doesn't think there's
anything, just like Dr. Lappe.

06:07.125 --> 06:11.499
And you. - There's not much.
A mystery that's been translated.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.875
A mystery that didn't selI and has
been transIated into odd languages.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.416
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

06:20.917 --> 06:23.416
Dutch.
- Spanish?

06:23.917 --> 06:24.875
Yes.

06:28.542 --> 06:32.291
Where did you get that about the ice?
DashielI Hammett? - Dick Tracy.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.541
Are you sure about this ideogram?

06:36.041 --> 06:39.708
Look at this face. Could l be wrong
about an ideogram?

06:41.083 --> 06:45.332
It's a great face.
But it's never been to China.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Ray, when can I get some
computer time? - Dick Tracy?

06:58.667 --> 07:01.958
A very underrated detective.
- There's some free time at 2:45.

07:04.041 --> 07:07.082
No, stay on scheduIe, l'Il get it.

07:10.041 --> 07:12.541
Four pieces, right?
- Right. - HoId it!

07:13.041 --> 07:14.833
Five.
- Affirmative, five.

07:15.333 --> 07:19.291
Where is Mr. Heidegger? - He calIed
in sick. - ProbabIy hung over again.

07:19.792 --> 07:23.374
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the fiIes and I

07:23.876 --> 07:27.082
came across an inquiry he sent
to Persian GuIf command.

07:27.250 --> 07:31.583
He did that for me.
- lt never went through my office.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.040
I asked for some research,
he didn't feel it was important.

07:35.876 --> 07:39.875
l wish you peopIe
wouId go through channeIs.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.207
What's on your mind?

08:38.041 --> 08:40.832
This was in the pouch
from New York Central.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.833
HQ in LangIey says there's no other
source to support your theory.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.457
CaIl this working on that book?
- l'Il have it by 4pm.

08:50.625 --> 08:56.875
We have peopIe to service machines.
- These things just Iook compIicated.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.666
l wonder if you are
entireIy happy here.

09:01.417 --> 09:04.666
Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious Iimits?

09:05.167 --> 09:10.040
I can't teIl people what I do.
- Why can't you accept that?

09:12.542 --> 09:15.875
l actuaIly trust a few peopIe.
That's the problem.

09:16.375 --> 09:19.332
lt's your turn to bring in lunch.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.332
What time is it?

09:22.834 --> 09:26.332
1 1 :22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 1 1 :30.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.916
You can wait 8 minutes.

10:16.834 --> 10:20.791
That's not a proper exit! - He always
goes out that way when it rains.

10:20.959 --> 10:25.875
PersonneI should enter and exit
by authorized means onIy!

11:14.500 --> 11:19.124
Shakespeare, how is it? - Terrific.
The rejection slips just pile up.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.082
Know the feeling.
I aIways wanted to be Escoffier.

11:23.584 --> 11:27.583
Maybe it's not too late. Van Gogh
was 30 before he began to paint.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.291
No mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.

11:31.625 --> 11:35.166
On the other hand, Mozart was 3 when
he started piano, and composed at 6.

11:35.709 --> 11:41.207
Fast starter, probably better.
- Van Gogh never sold a painting

11:41.709 --> 11:44.875
and Mozart died a pauper.
- Am l in the Public Library?

11:45.375 --> 11:49.416
Hey, that's a very bright man!
- EducationaI. That's why I come here.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.708
l come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

11:53.584 --> 11:56.583
No butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.708
Mr. Jennings is in the back.
He'lI sign for it.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.332
Here are the ...

13:44.125 --> 13:46.457
Mrs. RusselI, the Curtis report ...

14:52.250 --> 14:54.875
Would you move
from the window, pIease?

14:57.584 --> 14:58.457
Pardon?

14:59.041 --> 15:01.374
Would you move from the window?

15:12.959 --> 15:14.833
I won't scream.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.332
I know.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.082
SmaIl breakdown in security there?

16:05.917 --> 16:07.833
What are you doin'?

20:00.333 --> 20:03.583
What the helI are you doing?
SIeep at night, wilI ya?

20:29.458 --> 20:31.666

The section has been hit. - Level?

20:47.667 --> 20:53.499
LeveI of damage! - Everybody.
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, HaroId ...

20:54.000 --> 20:58.457
Are you on a company line?
- No, I'm in a phone booth.

20:58.959 --> 21:01.291
You're in vioIation of
communication procedures, Condor.

21:01.792 --> 21:07.000
Listen, you S.O.B.. l came back with
lunch and the whole house was dead!

21:07.500 --> 21:10.958
Has the incident been discovered
by anybody outside the company?

21:11.458 --> 21:15.207
l don't know. I don't think so.
- Are you damaged?

21:16.125 --> 21:19.749
Damaged ...? No.
- Are you armed?

21:22.333 --> 21:26.416
I have Mrs. ...I can't remember
her code name ... NightingaIe.

21:26.917 --> 21:30.416
She was afraid of being raped.

21:31.167 --> 21:34.875
lt's a .45 automatic.
WiIl you guys bring me in, please?

21:35.375 --> 21:38.249
I'm not a field agent.
l just read books! - Leave the area.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.416
Alright.
Do I come into headquarters now?

21:41.917 --> 21:45.875
Negative. Find a secure Iocation.
- Where?

21:46.333 --> 21:49.124
Avoid any pIace you are known.
Do not go home.

21:50.792 --> 21:54.000
Surface again in two hours
and caIl the Major.

21:55.709 --> 22:00.499
That'lI be 14:30 your time.
- Wait a minute, 2:30, right.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.958
WaIk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up. - Don't hang it ...?

22:17.667 --> 22:21.416
This is the Panic Officer.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.207

25:52.625 --> 25:54.332
It was a mistake, buddy.

28:44.208 --> 28:47.082

30:42.750 --> 30:44.040
You've got 55.

30:45.250 --> 30:48.916
This is ridiculous.
- It's standard procedure.

30:49.417 --> 30:52.916
To pick up a friend?
- And you, Mr. Wicks? - No, thanks.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.583
Side arm?
- Have you got a .45?

30:56.083 --> 30:58.875
You bet.
- Hey, let me help you with that.

31:02.792 --> 31:05.583
How Iong have you known Condor?
- Joey ...

31:06.083 --> 31:11.416
Before he was a bird even.
We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.

31:11.917 --> 31:14.749
Was she ever Condor's girI?
- Here you go, Mr. Wicks.

31:21.417 --> 31:23.249

31:23.750 --> 31:26.624
This morning. About those murders.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.207
What murders?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.000
Here he is.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.000

Get in the car.
Don't make a sound, don't be dumb.

35:18.667 --> 35:22.708
Please don't hurt me. - Where
do you live? - BrookIyn Heights.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.124
AIone?
- l Iive with a friend ...

35:27.250 --> 35:28.958
You live alone. Come on, let's go.

38:00.041 --> 38:01.958
Leave the stuff.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.583
Hi, Kath.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.040
You should have said helIo.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.791
Where is it?
- Here.

38:25.083 --> 38:27.166
"Condor shot us both."

38:27.667 --> 38:31.082
That was the onIy statement he couId
make before they operated on him.

38:31.584 --> 38:35.749
And the other man, Barber? Is he dead?
- Before he hit the ground.

38:36.250 --> 38:40.708
A remarkable shot.
A half-inch above his flak jacket.

38:43.292 --> 38:46.207
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

38:49.292 --> 38:52.833
"Two years military service,
Signal Corps,

38:53.333 --> 38:56.541
Telephone lineman, switchboard
maintenance, 6 months overseas,

38:57.041 --> 39:01.082
Separated 9/61 , worked at
communication research colIege."

39:01.876 --> 39:05.040
The question was:
ls he quaIified with a handgun?

39:05.542 --> 39:07.875
No, sir. M-1 rifle and carbine.

39:08.709 --> 39:10.624
EvidentIy it was sheer luck.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.332
Or else ...

39:14.542 --> 39:18.541
Or eIse what? - Condor isn't the man
his fiIe says he is.

39:19.041 --> 39:21.833
Where did he Iearn the basic moves?
- He reads.

39:23.292 --> 39:27.000
What the heIl does that mean?
- He reads everything.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.624
I don't understand ...
- Yes ... very good.

39:31.417 --> 39:35.708
Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing. - Extraordinary.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.875
lt was very weIl executed.
- It requires planning, communication,

39:40.375 --> 39:44.082
tracks.
I'm not asking for footprints

39:44.584 --> 39:47.541
but a blade of grass,
a broken twig ...

39:48.041 --> 39:52.708
Yes, sir. Wicks seems to be
aIl we've got. - Where do we have him?

39:53.208 --> 39:54.958
We don't.

39:57.959 --> 40:00.916
They rushed him to emergency
before we got word.

40:01.542 --> 40:05.040
Maybe we should Ieak the name of the
hospital. Get Condor to make a move.

40:05.542 --> 40:09.166
Don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

40:09.667 --> 40:13.958
He does seem rather more interesting
than just another reader researcher.

40:14.458 --> 40:20.583
ExampIe: Has he gone into business
for himself? Was he turned around?

40:21.208 --> 40:25.541
Does someone operate him?
SexuaI? Broke?

40:26.041 --> 40:30.291
VulnerabIe?
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

40:30.792 --> 40:33.040
Did he arrange the hit?

40:33.500 --> 40:35.749
Is that why he's stiIl in flight?

40:36.250 --> 40:39.332
StilI, he may be an innocent.

40:39.834 --> 40:45.207
But then, why didn't he
come in gently, with Mr Wicks?

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
"Tentrex Industries". - lt's a cover.
I work for the ClA.

40:53.500 --> 40:57.958
Jesus, your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girI.

40:59.083 --> 41:03.000
Look it up. "Tentrex lndustries".

41:05.542 --> 41:09.374
And Iook up the number for the ClA in
New York. - You mean it's Iisted?

41:09.876 --> 41:11.624
Under US Government Agencies.

41:16.750 --> 41:20.374
ls this what you do?
This photography?

41:23.917 --> 41:29.499
lt's the same number. You could have
had the card made. - But I didn't.

41:30.375 --> 41:33.291
You reaIly get into it, don't you?
- Sit down!

41:38.083 --> 41:39.583
l toId you I had a friend.

41:41.834 --> 41:45.958
I take 1 5,5/34. What size are you?
- What are you, a cIown?

41:46.458 --> 41:50.082
l'm scared! - So am I! - What for?
You've got a gun! - Yes!

41:54.125 --> 41:56.166
That is not enough.

42:14.417 --> 42:17.332
I work for the ClA,
I'm not a spy.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.666
I just read books.

42:31.250 --> 42:34.791
We read everything
that's published in the worId.

42:35.292 --> 42:39.457
And we feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes

42:39.959 --> 42:42.457
into a computer and the computer

42:42.959 --> 42:46.082
checks against
actual ClA plans and operations.

42:46.584 --> 42:48.332
l Iook for leaks,
I look for new ideas.

42:49.959 --> 42:54.791
We read adventures
and novels and journaIs ...

42:58.750 --> 43:01.583
Who'd invent a job like that?

43:04.208 --> 43:05.166
Listen!

43:06.792 --> 43:11.875
People are trying to kilI me! - Who?
- l don't know, but there's a reason.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.040
There is a reason!

43:16.041 --> 43:22.416
And l just need some safe quiet time
to puIl things together.

43:24.375 --> 43:26.708
Here?
- Here.

43:28.417 --> 43:30.499
lt's onIy fair ...

43:46.208 --> 43:52.666
Where's the guy with the shirts?
- He's skiing in the Green Mountains.

43:54.750 --> 43:57.249
We want to go cross-country skiing

43:57.834 --> 44:01.207
for a couple of weeks.
Away from everything.

44:05.375 --> 44:09.875
What time's the news go on? Six?
- Six o'cIock. - 40 Minutes.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.332
No, please ...

44:32.375 --> 44:34.875
Lie down against the walI.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.082
Put this arm behind you.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.166
Now you Iisten to me:

44:43.667 --> 44:45.124
I am tired.

44:46.292 --> 44:49.082
l've got to cIose my eyes for a whiIe.

44:49.584 --> 44:51.875
l can't think straight.

44:53.667 --> 44:57.416
lf you try to move
or climb off the bed,

44:57.917 --> 45:00.207
l'Il know it. I'lI feel it,

45:00.709 --> 45:03.833
and l promise I'lI hurt you.

45:05.584 --> 45:08.082
Can't I stay in the other room?

45:12.125 --> 45:15.249
l beIieve what you told me.

45:15.750 --> 45:17.708
No, you don't.

45:18.834 --> 45:21.291
I don't know if l do.

45:21.792 --> 45:23.749
That includes Condor, of course.

45:24.250 --> 45:26.207
Yes, l owe you Condor.

45:26.709 --> 45:29.666
Otherwise ...
- "Otherwise" does not exist.

45:31.709 --> 45:35.082
WiIl Condor take long?
- Do you want an estimate?

45:35.584 --> 45:39.166
There is a time factor.
- AIways with you peopIe.

45:41.292 --> 45:46.207
Condor is an amateur.
He's lost, unpredictable

45:46.709 --> 45:49.457
and perhaps even sentimental.

45:49.959 --> 45:52.124
He couId fooI a professionaI.

45:53.959 --> 45:57.332
Not deliberateIy,
but preciseIy because he is Iost.

45:57.834 --> 45:59.958
He doesn't know what to do.

46:00.458 --> 46:05.374
UnIike Wicks, who has always been
entirely predictable.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.207
The man Condor kilIed
in the alIey? - Some friend of his.

46:15.667 --> 46:19.124
A close friend? - I suppose so. Why?
- It interests me.

46:19.625 --> 46:22.499
What was his name?
- I don't know. He was nobody.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.833
He was somebody for Condor.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.749
Get his name and address.

46:28.250 --> 46:31.291
Have it for me when I caIl you.

46:32.750 --> 46:34.457
What about Wicks?

46:39.208 --> 46:42.332
Do you want the firm to question him?

46:42.834 --> 46:44.791
They wiIl, you know.

46:46.292 --> 46:48.040
We don't want that.

46:49.917 --> 46:51.749
Cost you nothing.

46:52.250 --> 46:54.624
I was careIess with Condor.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.708
Wicks wiIl be done for nothing.

47:01.792 --> 47:05.040
What time is it?
- It's news time.

47:54.417 --> 47:56.040
LoneIy pictures.

47:58.834 --> 47:59.875
So?

48:03.709 --> 48:05.332
You're funny.

48:07.333 --> 48:12.624
You take pictures of empty streets
and trees without leaves ...

48:14.458 --> 48:15.708
It's winter.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.040
Not quite winter ...

48:20.208 --> 48:21.833
They look like ...

48:23.709 --> 48:25.291
... November.

48:25.792 --> 48:28.207
Not autumn, not winter, in-between.

48:33.834 --> 48:35.000
l Iike them.

48:38.584 --> 48:39.708
Thanks.

48:47.917 --> 48:51.082
The shootings behind
the Hotel Ansonia remain a mystery.

48:51.250 --> 48:54.457
The victims' identities
have not been reveaIed ...

48:56.584 --> 48:57.708
Victims?

48:59.417 --> 49:02.833
Can you say anything about a motive?
- Not at present.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.374
Have you identified the victims?
- Insurance company empIoyees. - What?

49:10.750 --> 49:14.166
Did the victims know their assaiIants?
- AbsoIuteIy not.

49:14.667 --> 49:19.583
One man dead, one seriously wounded
in an alIey in Manhattan.

49:20.083 --> 49:25.000
And the man with the gun
is stilI at large. - Sam!

49:29.167 --> 49:32.457
Jesus Christ, victims ...
What is he saying?

49:35.584 --> 49:37.666
What happened in that alIey?

49:39.834 --> 49:44.249
I didn't shoot him.
You shot somebody. - But not Sam!

49:46.417 --> 49:49.207
Nobody in that alIey
said anything about the CIA.

49:57.709 --> 49:59.374
But they were there.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.207
You're telIing me ... - They had to
have been to change that story.

50:08.375 --> 50:10.332
What did Higgins say?
He said he wouldn't be there.

50:10.834 --> 50:13.541
The section chief was coming in ...

50:17.542 --> 50:19.708
He'd have to reach Sam.

50:20.208 --> 50:22.207
Sam wouId have to caIl Mae.

50:50.208 --> 50:54.291
l need your car. - Grand theft! You
don't want troubIe with the poIice.

50:57.625 --> 51:00.666
This guy in Vermont. What'Il he do
if you don't show up?

51:01.167 --> 51:02.749
He probabIy caIl soon.

51:03.250 --> 51:07.416
WilI he show up here?
- The gun gives you the right

51:07.917 --> 51:12.332
to rough me up ... - Rough you up?
- Yes, what are you doing in my house?

51:12.834 --> 51:16.416
Have l raped you?
- The night is young.

51:33.709 --> 51:35.749
You don't believe anything l've said.

51:39.083 --> 51:43.000
l beIieve
you're in trouble. In danger.

51:44.750 --> 51:50.875
But l don't know what kind and I'm
not sure how much of it is made up.

51:53.917 --> 51:55.583
It doesn't matter.

51:56.208 --> 51:59.374
Wait a minute.
l'm trying to understand ...

52:03.834 --> 52:06.374
What are you doing? Let me go!

52:14.333 --> 52:15.791
You buIly!

52:16.667 --> 52:18.457
Don't tie me up, please!

52:22.709 --> 52:23.875
This is ...

52:25.417 --> 52:28.332
... unfair!
- I know.

53:40.959 --> 53:42.666
You're early.

53:43.167 --> 53:44.583
Come on in.

53:46.709 --> 53:48.708
Is Janice working Iate?

53:52.208 --> 53:53.583
So is Sam.

53:58.167 --> 54:00.040
Pour one for me, too, wilI you?

54:02.625 --> 54:06.249
lt's their own fauIt
if we're zonked when they get here.

54:09.500 --> 54:14.666
We'Il give 'em an hour and if they're
not here, it's just you and me,

54:15.167 --> 54:17.082
just Iike old times ...

54:22.542 --> 54:24.040
What is it?

54:24.625 --> 54:26.749
What is it, Joey?

54:27.542 --> 54:29.249
What's wrong?

54:29.750 --> 54:32.249
How do you know Sam's working late?

54:32.750 --> 54:37.000
What do you think he's doing?
- Did he calI? - 2 or 2:30.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.040
What did he say exactIy?

54:39.542 --> 54:42.082
He had the Center calI.

54:42.584 --> 54:47.791
Who? - I didnt't recognize the voice.
lt wasn't the usuaI Iady.

55:02.917 --> 55:07.207
Third damn time tonight.
lt's some creepy burglar.

55:07.709 --> 55:11.332
l want you to get out of here.
- I can't, Joey, l'm cooking!

55:11.834 --> 55:14.708
Go to BiIl and EiIeen's.
Stay there tilI l calI you.

55:18.208 --> 55:20.916
Don't argue! Move!

55:21.417 --> 55:23.666
Go upstairs and stay there.

55:24.167 --> 55:27.916
Do what l'm telIing you!
Stay there.

55:28.792 --> 55:31.666
I'lI calI you.
- Joey, you're scaring me!

56:26.417 --> 56:27.332
Yours?

56:32.083 --> 56:33.000
No.

56:56.667 --> 56:58.958
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

57:05.125 --> 57:06.749
Kids ...

57:07.458 --> 57:09.708
Probably the same everywhere.

57:31.792 --> 57:33.749
That's the second floor.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.708
l do it alI the time.

57:50.667 --> 57:52.833
After you.
- Go ahead.

58:37.458 --> 58:39.416
Anybody here good with a coat hanger?

58:39.917 --> 58:44.040
l Iocked my keys in my car.
I'lI give you some money.

58:44.542 --> 58:49.499
You can't telI me you never busted
into a car before. 5 bucks.

58:51.208 --> 58:54.124
l don't have much time.
Okay? Come on.

58:55.333 --> 58:57.082
Alright, 5 bucks.

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:53.499
l want you to answer the phone.

01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:58.374
l'm not answering any phone!

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:01.207
Answer it!

01:01:01.709 --> 01:01:04.457
TelI him what a great
son of a bitch you are!

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.040
l want you to be casuaI and nice.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:16.374
Where the heIl are you?

01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:19.249
Ben?
- Who do you think it is?

01:01:22.542 --> 01:01:27.124
You're supposed to be up here by now.
- l know ...

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.082
l was held up.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:37.207
That's no excuse. Come on.
Does this trip matter to you?

01:01:37.709 --> 01:01:40.082
lt matters.
- Yeah, sure ...

01:01:40.584 --> 01:01:45.416
No, it does! - This has happened over
and over. Last minute some excuse.

01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:49.457
No, this is different.
- What's up?

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.416
The car ...

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:58.291
... broke down.
- What broke down?

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:03.207
The generator went.
- That's gonna take for ever.

01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:09.000
Maybe not.
I tried to caIl you before, but ...

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.833
The generator ...
... it's going to take too Iong.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:16.207
Look, forget about the car.
Take the bus first thing tomorrow.

01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:18.916
I'lI try.

01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:24.624
Try ...?
What's going on? Are you okay?

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:30.499
I'm okay. I'm fine.
- You don't sound so fine.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.916
l wish you would understand.

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:40.416
I do. I do. It's just that
l'm disappointed, that's alI.

01:02:41.834 --> 01:02:47.833
I realIy wanted
to be with you up here.

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.291
I know.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.583
We'lI have time.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:02.457
Get the very first bus

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:04.291
Alright.

01:03:06.709 --> 01:03:09.332
Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.833
Listen, l'Il be going.

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:52.833
In the morning.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:58.833
Where?

01:04:08.959 --> 01:04:10.749
Was it aIright?

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:14.583
AIright?

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:17.958
Outside. Was it safe?

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.166
l'm not sure.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.499
l wish l knew more.

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:44.207
About you.

01:04:46.041 --> 01:04:47.082
Yesterday ...

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:49.791
Today ...

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:54.249
I don't remember yesterday.

01:04:56.417 --> 01:04:58.374
Today it rained.

01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.541
Why did you tie me up Iike that?

01:05:07.584 --> 01:05:10.583
You thought l'd calI the poIice.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.249
l wouldn't have.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.124
Why?

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:22.791
Sometimes ...

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:28.124
... l take a picture
that isn't like me,

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:34.207
but l took it, so it is like me.

01:05:38.876 --> 01:05:41.000
l put those pictures away.

01:05:42.834 --> 01:05:44.624
l'd Iike to see those pictures.

01:05:45.125 --> 01:05:47.291
We don't know each other that weIl.

01:05:56.584 --> 01:05:58.749
Do you know anybody that weIl?

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:02.791
I don't think
l want to know you very weIl.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.082
I don't think
you're going to live much longer.

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:13.416
WelI, I may surprise you.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.875
You're not teIling the truth.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:23.000
What? - You want somebody,
who's not gonna live much longer.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.833
At Ieast somebody who'd be on his way.

01:06:29.292 --> 01:06:30.708
You take pictures.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.499
BeautifuI pictures ...

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:40.666
... of empty streets and trees
with no leaves in November.

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:45.249
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:52.624
How much do you want?

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:02.833
I just want to stop it.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.166
For a few hours,

01:07:14.709 --> 01:07:16.374
for the rest of the night.

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:21.833
Then l'Il go.

01:10:34.417 --> 01:10:37.958
What was his name?

01:10:38.876 --> 01:10:41.082
What did Higgins say?

01:10:41.584 --> 01:10:44.833
Your Department Head'Il bring you in.
- l've never met him.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:54.916
Anything in the early pouch?

01:10:57.208 --> 01:11:11.708
HQ at Langley says there's no other
source to support your theory.

01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:45.207
Wicks!

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:14.457
You didn't sIeep welI.
- You didn't?

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:16.457
No, you didn't.

01:12:17.959 --> 01:12:19.457
You were up earIy.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:23.291
I had some thoughts.

01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:26.541
l've got a pIan.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:30.499
l don't know
if it'Il work or not, but ...

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:37.416
... I'lI need your help.
- Have l ever denied you anything?

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:46.708
When things quiet down,

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:50.666
you reaIly are
a very sweet man to be with.

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:56.416
You had bad dreams.

01:12:56.917 --> 01:12:59.000
You talked in your sIeep.

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:04.166
What did l say?
- Who's Janice?

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:13.624
Was she a voIunteer,
or a draftee like me?

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.040
She was ...

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:21.082
... a friend.

01:13:21.584 --> 01:13:22.958
She's dead.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:32.207
Do I have permission to shower?
- You don't have to heIp.

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:36.583
I'lI heIp. You can aIways depend on
the spy fucker.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:48.374
I'm sorry ... - No.
- No, l didn't mean ...

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:54.082
l didn't mean to say that.
l'm realIy sorry.

01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:58.291
l'd Iike to help you.

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:25.166

Leave it on the stoop.

01:14:50.876 --> 01:14:52.624
Somebody's got to sign for it.

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.749
She's not here.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.749
Okay, you can sign.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:08.624
Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:15.207
Wonderful. - Government pens.
l don't have another pen.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.040
I'lI get one.

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.499
Now listen: You're okay.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.666
You're okay!

01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:58.332
Can you get dressed?
You're okay! Get dressed, hurry.

lucky if we have any phone service!

01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:15.666

Extension 1 891 .

1 891 .

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.416
Let me speak to Mr. Wicks.

01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:53.916
He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calIing?

01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:58.583
How do you feel? Okay?
- What did you do to those peopIe?

01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:02.082
What people?
l don't know who they are.

01:19:02.584 --> 01:19:06.708
l fiIe a report
and a guy in Washington reads it.

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:10.000
Then he comes to New York to shoot me.
- Did you know him?

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.666
No. - Did you know the maiIman?
- No,

01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:21.291
but the guy in Washington did. - And
the next one? - I won't wait for him.

01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:25.082
Has he gone doubIe or dirty?
- l don't know, sir.

01:19:25.584 --> 01:19:28.875
ls he stilI in New York City?
- I wouIdn't be.

01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:33.374
Question: ls there an inteIligence
network undetected by the CIA,

01:19:33.959 --> 01:19:36.875
Iinking Arabic-speaking countries
with Spanish-speaking?

01:19:37.375 --> 01:19:40.082
We're aIready visibIe,
let's not become conspicuous.

01:19:40.584 --> 01:19:43.374
If our agents aren't enough,
use freeIance.

01:19:43.876 --> 01:19:46.624
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:11.416
Okay, Iet's get it over with.

01:20:17.792 --> 01:20:18.833

AppIications are here.

01:20:49.959 --> 01:20:53.541
See Mr. Addison. Turn right,
first door on your left.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:22.958
Mr. Addison?

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.958
He's in CIearance.
You passed it on your Ieft.

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:32.457
Sorry, thank you.

01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:32.708
I didn't get the job.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.457
Looks good ...

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:42.833
l have this friend and he asked me
to give you a message.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:49.958
Quote: "Mr Higgins, this introduces
a friend of mine, 'Sparrow Hawk'.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:57.166
PIease accompany her
to the Nassau Street exit, now."

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:04.166
PersonalIy, l'd do it,
because he has this huge gun

01:23:04.667 --> 01:23:08.166
and he's Iooking at us right now.

01:23:08.876 --> 01:23:12.624
l'Il save this for you. ShalI we?

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.040
To your left, pIease.

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:44.082
Okay, sit up!
Back up against the paneI.

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.916
Take it easy, I'm not armed.

01:23:48.876 --> 01:23:51.916
They could be DF-ing us if you have a
transmitter hidden. What's this?

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:57.499
DF? You do read everything, don't you?
- Something is rotten in the Company!

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.833
You never compIained tilI yesterday.
- You never kiIled my friends before!

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.749
Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit. Society?

01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:07.541
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.332

Ring a belI?

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:15.457
Where did you get that?
- The maiIman.

01:24:15.959 --> 01:24:19.207
The one you sent
with the uniform, automatic gun ...

01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:24.833
We never use mailmen. - Would you
know a taIl bIond man, 6ft 4?

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:31.249
Strong like a farmer, not American.
Accent, maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

01:24:57.834 --> 01:25:00.166
Yes?
- Was the letter delivered?

01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:05.749
The return receipt has not arrived.
- You shouId have done it yourseIf.

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:09.583
A more complicated package
had to be handIed.

01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:12.332
But l might have
underestimated this one.

01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:16.124
I was toId
you never make that kind of mistake.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.499
What wiIl you do?
- Wait.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.958
Then what? - PeopIe who move
Ieave word of change of adress.

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:29.082
l want to see that report.
- Do you know him?

01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:31.791
ProfessionaIly, yes.
- He kilIs peopIe!

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Yes.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:38.541
He works for the Company?
- Did once. He's a contract agent.

01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:42.374
Freelance.
Where did you see him?

01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:49.291
It would heIp if l knew.
- Help who?

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:53.124
Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody. - Terrific answer!

01:25:54.792 --> 01:25:56.624
I know.
- What's his name?

01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:59.374
When I knew him, Joubert.

01:25:59.876 --> 01:26:04.291
Who'd hire him?. You don't Iook him up
in the YeIlow Pages! - Right.

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:07.916
Have to be somebody in the Community.
- Community?

01:26:08.417 --> 01:26:13.833
lnteIligence field. - "Community"?
You guys are kind to yourseIves!

01:26:15.834 --> 01:26:19.749
l want to see that report. - It went
to headquarters and disappeared.

01:26:20.584 --> 01:26:23.624
Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:27.291
You teIl me.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:34.958
l pick up traces of an inteIligence
network the company doesn't know.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:40.499
And I report it. Now why is that
going to make anybody mad?

01:26:40.959 --> 01:26:45.374
Unless it was the Company's network
and you didn't want it blown!

01:26:46.417 --> 01:26:48.749
Somebody is lying, Higgins.

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:54.457
Come on. Why is everybody so shy?

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:57.457
I'm not shy.

01:26:58.709 --> 01:27:01.875
I don't know. That's what worries me.

01:27:03.167 --> 01:27:06.749
l don't know.
- Ask Wicks. - Wicks died.

01:27:10.917 --> 01:27:14.416
Someone yanked him off the
Iife-support system at the hospital.

01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:26.708
Get me in, Higgins.

01:27:29.125 --> 01:27:33.749
What good wouId that do, if they are
inside, what good wouId that do?

01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:37.457
What should l do?

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:41.666
I'm sorry.

01:27:43.417 --> 01:27:53.332
You're sorry?

01:27:57.167 --> 01:27:58.583
l get it.

01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:03.541
You expect me to draw fire!

01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:10.124
Like a penny arcade bear parading
back and forth waiting for somebody!

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.791
And you'lI pick him up
before he does it, or after?

01:28:14.292 --> 01:28:16.916
l'm gonna cross-check aIl the names.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:21.124
Nice taIking to you, Higgins.
- Wait, where wilI l find you?

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.207
I'lI find you.

01:28:32.167 --> 01:28:34.082
Do you trust him?

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:37.416
Trust ...
- Does he trust you?

01:28:37.917 --> 01:28:42.374
He can't trust anybody. - How couId
anybody sneak in and fool them?

01:28:42.876 --> 01:28:45.207
Maybe nobody did. - Then ...

01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:48.457
Maybe there's another ClA ...

01:28:49.584 --> 01:28:51.166
... inside the ClA.

01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.374
The light's gone off!

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.666
lt's a hoteI room.
- What hoteI?

01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:35.332
There's no tag. It's Room 81 9 in New
York. - There's a code on the edge.

01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:37.708
You in the trade?

01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:41.124
l read about it in a story.
- A story about locksmiths?

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.875
The Iock manufacturer
can give you the name of the hoteI.

01:29:45.375 --> 01:29:47.958
l don't want to read
about you in the newspapers.

01:29:48.458 --> 01:29:50.791
WiIl you make the calI?

01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:33.166
l'm doing a survey.

01:30:34.208 --> 01:30:37.124
Do you beIieve the condor
is an endangered species?

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:00.791
Your room number, please.
- 81 9.

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:10.332
I just had an interesting calI.
- Who is this?

01:31:10.834 --> 01:31:14.124
In reference to
an aIl but extinct bird, the condor.

01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:17.082
Have you had such a caIl?
- You're a fool to calI me here!

01:31:17.584 --> 01:31:20.040
You had no such calI?
- No.

01:31:20.834 --> 01:31:25.416
Must have been the Audubon Society.
They're stilI in New York City.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:33.666
Langley, Computer.

01:31:34.167 --> 01:31:37.207

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:42.374
TRS. Tone, symbol for number.

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:46.124
Computer is ready.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:00.583
That number is 202-227-0098.

01:32:16.959 --> 01:32:18.374
CNA, Mrs. Coleman.

01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:23.000
HaroId Thomas, Customer Service

... 202-227-0098.

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:31.082
One moment pIease.

01:32:33.834 --> 01:32:35.000
That would be

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:40.916
Mr. Leonard Atwood, 365 Mackenzie Pl.,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:21.875
Cross-check this tape against Wicks

01:33:33.417 --> 01:33:34.624
Hat size ...

01:33:41.167 --> 01:33:42.583
"Lucifer" ...

01:33:43.292 --> 01:33:45.708
- Alright, run "Lucifer".

01:34:08.458 --> 01:34:12.166
I'lI be damned.

01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:08.249
This is the Major.
- Condor. Find me Higgins.

01:35:08.834 --> 01:35:11.958
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.

01:35:16.876 --> 01:35:17.916

the Alsatian. - Where are you?

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:32.541
Where are you, Condor?
- Quiet down ...

01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:34.958
Higgins?

01:35:35.792 --> 01:35:37.708
Yeah, I'm right here.

01:35:38.917 --> 01:35:40.249
Who is Atwood?

01:35:50.041 --> 01:35:51.374
Where are you, Higgins?

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.040
Aren't we pals anymore?

01:36:01.333 --> 01:36:02.457
Something?

01:36:03.375 --> 01:36:05.124
Major?
- Got him!.

01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:07.624
Let me see that.

01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:11.374
What's he doing in BrookIyn?

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:16.166
We can get ...
- Wait!

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.708
What's going on? - The son of a bitch
wired together 50 phones!

01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:31.583
What? - Everybody in BrookIyn
is talking to each other!

01:36:50.458 --> 01:36:55.166
I didn't know you smoked.
- I quit three years ago.

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:59.082
You Iook paIe.
- lt's the Iight in here.

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:05.624
What wiIl you do there?

01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:09.124
See a guy.
- More secrets ...

01:37:09.584 --> 01:37:11.833
Like those pictures you hide.

01:37:12.959 --> 01:37:14.040
Yes ...

01:37:15.375 --> 01:37:18.708
Someday I'd like to show them to you.

01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:22.666
If you Iive through this.

01:37:23.667 --> 01:37:25.916
You could drive me to Washington.

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.791
No.

01:37:39.625 --> 01:37:43.791
You have a lot of very fine quaIities.

01:37:44.292 --> 01:37:47.332
But ...
- What fine quaIities?

01:37:56.083 --> 01:37:58.416
You have good eyes.

01:37:59.709 --> 01:38:03.583
Not kind, but they don't Iie,

01:38:04.083 --> 01:38:08.374
and they don't Iook away much
and they don't miss anything.

01:38:11.125 --> 01:38:13.791
I could use eyes like that.

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.291
You're overdue in Vermont.

01:38:23.876 --> 01:38:26.040
Is he a tough guy?

01:38:27.458 --> 01:38:29.457
He's pretty tough ...

01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:36.166
What wiIl he do?
- Understand. ProbabIy.

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:39.624
Boy ...

01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:41.833
That is tough.

01:38:44.167 --> 01:38:47.791
AIl aboard for Baltimore
and Washington D.C..!

01:38:51.208 --> 01:38:54.040
Kathy ... I need time.

01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:59.958
Eight hours or so, that's alI.
TilI noon, to do what I have to do.

01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:03.833
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.

01:39:04.333 --> 01:39:06.207
Are you going right to Vermont?

01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:09.541
Yes.

01:39:11.375 --> 01:39:13.875
What I mean is, don't calI anyone.

01:39:16.041 --> 01:39:18.416
Don't stop, pIease.

01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:21.499
Don't teIl anyone about ...

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:36.249
Jesus, I didn't ...

01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:46.166
Hey, you take care of yourself.
- l'Il do my best.

01:39:48.667 --> 01:39:50.082
Do your best.

01:39:59.584 --> 01:40:03.249
Why aren't you further along?
- With the Company, sir?

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:07.040
You seem perfect for it.

01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:11.541
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?

01:40:12.834 --> 01:40:14.291
I try to be, sir.

01:40:15.083 --> 01:40:20.332
You were recruited out of schooI?
- No, interviewed in Korea.

01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:24.291
You served with
CoIoneI Donovan in the OSS?

01:40:24.792 --> 01:40:29.791
l saiIed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

01:40:30.292 --> 01:40:34.875
lt doesn't seem like
much of a war now, but it was.

01:40:35.375 --> 01:40:37.499
I go even further back than that.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.416
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to caIl it

01:40:42.917 --> 01:40:45.291
before we knew enough to number them.

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:49.207
Do you miss that kind of action?
- No.

01:40:50.917 --> 01:40:53.833
I miss that kind of clarity.

01:40:57.667 --> 01:40:58.749
Yes?

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.124
Thank you.

01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:06.374
He's being heId at New York Center.

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:16.916
Mr. Higgins, you do understand
the Company's position?

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.833
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:09.040
What is this? What's going on?

01:42:27.584 --> 01:42:40.666
Who are you?

01:42:41.167 --> 01:42:42.791
What are you doing here?

01:42:44.584 --> 01:42:46.291
I'm Condor.

01:42:49.959 --> 01:42:51.457
Sit down.

01:42:53.041 --> 01:42:55.040
What do you do for a living?

01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:58.291
Don't be ridiculous.

01:42:59.417 --> 01:43:00.916
What do you do ...

01:43:01.917 --> 01:43:03.332
... exactly?

01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:09.541
Deputy Director of Operations.

01:43:10.041 --> 01:43:13.082
What section?
- Middle East.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.833
What are you working on?

01:43:20.292 --> 01:43:21.875
What are you doing?

01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:27.541
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the A.L.H.S.?

01:43:28.333 --> 01:43:31.416
There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

01:43:31.917 --> 01:43:32.833
Yes.

01:43:38.792 --> 01:43:40.708
lt was your network l turned up.

01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:48.833
Doing what?

01:43:49.959 --> 01:43:54.541
What does Operations care about
a bunch of books, a book in Dutch?

01:43:56.167 --> 01:43:58.040
A book out of VenezueIa ...

01:43:58.876 --> 01:44:00.082
Mystery stories in Arabic.

01:44:00.584 --> 01:44:03.291
What is so important about ...

01:44:09.167 --> 01:44:10.708
... oil fieIds?

01:44:14.876 --> 01:44:15.916
OiI ...

01:44:28.792 --> 01:44:30.583
That's it, isn't it?

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:38.791
This whoIe damn thing was about oiI!

01:44:40.167 --> 01:44:42.000
Wasn't it?

01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:45.291
Yes, it was.

01:44:46.876 --> 01:44:48.082
Don't turn around.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.583
Put your thumb on the hammer.

01:44:57.542 --> 01:44:59.583
ReIease it sIowly.

01:45:02.959 --> 01:45:04.833
Set down the gun on the desk.

01:45:11.542 --> 01:45:12.916
Don't move.

01:45:32.584 --> 01:45:34.666
You were quite good, until this.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:41.332
This move was predictable.

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:06.583
What?

01:46:09.917 --> 01:46:12.000
Did you touch anything eIse?

01:46:14.542 --> 01:46:16.374
You're working for the Company again!

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.958
The desk? The lamp?

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:24.332
Jesus, they took you back!

01:46:25.542 --> 01:46:28.207
Just for this. For Atwood.

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:33.583
He's with the Company! Why ...?

01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:40.291
l'm not interested in "why", more in
"when", sometimes "where".

01:46:40.792 --> 01:46:42.541
Always "how much".

01:46:43.834 --> 01:46:46.749
l suspect
he was becoming an embarassment.

01:46:48.667 --> 01:46:49.666
As you are.

01:46:57.709 --> 01:47:00.374
So you're not finished?
- Pardon?

01:47:00.876 --> 01:47:04.291
Oh, no, l had no arrangement
with the Company concerning you.

01:47:04.792 --> 01:47:08.291
They didn't know you wouId be here.
l knew you would.

01:47:13.333 --> 01:47:14.833
Didn't you send the maiIman?

01:47:16.041 --> 01:47:18.833
That was a business
arrangement with Atwood.

01:47:19.333 --> 01:47:20.875
But you see ...

01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:28.958
Come on.

01:48:12.333 --> 01:48:14.541
TeIl me about the girl.

01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:19.875
What about the girl?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.708
She was chosen ... how?

01:48:24.834 --> 01:48:30.249
By age? Her car? Appearance?
- At random.

01:48:31.458 --> 01:48:33.749
Chance.
- ReaIly ...?

01:48:37.792 --> 01:48:40.040
Can l drop you?

01:48:45.292 --> 01:48:47.875
l'd Iike to go back to New York.

01:48:50.584 --> 01:48:53.082
You have not much future there.

01:48:58.876 --> 01:49:00.457
lt wilI happen this way:

01:49:01.876 --> 01:49:03.374
You may be walking,

01:49:05.083 --> 01:49:08.624
maybe the first sunny day of spring.

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:12.207
And a car wiIl slow beside you,

01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:17.416
and a door wiIl open
and someone you know, even trust,

01:49:17.917 --> 01:49:19.416
wiIl get out.

01:49:21.625 --> 01:49:25.000
And he wilI smile. A becoming smiIe.

01:49:26.959 --> 01:49:29.541
But he wilI Ieave open the car door

01:49:31.667 --> 01:49:34.166
and offer to give you a Iift.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.082
You seem to understand it aIl so welI.

01:49:45.375 --> 01:49:46.916
What wouId you suggest?

01:49:48.167 --> 01:49:52.916
PersonalIy, l'd prefer Europe.
- Europe? - Yes.

01:49:54.041 --> 01:49:59.000
The fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.374
Someone is aIways wilIing to pay.

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.000
l would find it ...

01:50:09.834 --> 01:50:14.583
... tiring. - Oh, no, it's
quite restfuI. It's aImost peacefuI.

01:50:15.625 --> 01:50:18.749
No need to beIieve in either side,
or any side.

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:23.583
There is no cause.
There's onIy yourself.

01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:26.499
The beIief is in your own precision.

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:35.374
l was born in the US, Joubert.

01:50:37.667 --> 01:50:40.583
I miss it when I'm away too long.

01:50:41.041 --> 01:50:42.958
A pity.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.166
l don't think so.

01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:52.708
Can you drop me at the station?

01:50:53.208 --> 01:50:56.166
It would be my pIeasure.

01:51:05.375 --> 01:51:07.000
For that day.

01:51:27.584 --> 01:51:28.416
Higgins!

01:51:50.792 --> 01:51:53.875
Why do calI so Iate?
We were worried. - Likewise.

01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:58.583
ls the car for me? - Yeah, it's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:07.916
Let's say for the purposes of
argument, I had a .45 in my pocket,

01:52:10.041 --> 01:52:12.624
you'd take a walk with me, right?

01:52:14.667 --> 01:52:16.124
Which way?

01:52:17.083 --> 01:52:19.958
West. SlowIy.

01:52:20.458 --> 01:52:23.082
Stay in front of me 3 or 4 steps.

01:52:31.876 --> 01:52:33.416
Where are we going?

01:52:35.041 --> 01:52:36.875
Wave them on ahead.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.958
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

01:52:50.458 --> 01:52:53.249
Are you crazy?
- Am I?

01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:57.000
Do we have pIans?
- No, absolutely not.

01:52:57.584 --> 01:52:59.791
We have games. That's aIl.

01:53:00.292 --> 01:53:05.624
We pIay games. What if?
How many men? What would it take?

01:53:06.125 --> 01:53:08.499
How can we destabilize a regime?

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.666
That's what we're paid to do.
- WaIk on.

01:53:13.333 --> 01:53:14.499
Go on.

01:53:18.959 --> 01:53:23.708
So Atwood just took the games too
seriousIy. He was reaIly gonna do it.

01:53:24.208 --> 01:53:30.416
Renegade operation. There was no way.
Not with the heat on the Company.

01:53:30.917 --> 01:53:36.000
What if there hadn't been any heat?
What if I hadn't stumbled on the plan?

01:53:37.125 --> 01:53:41.875
Different baIl game.
There was nothing wrong with the pIan.

01:53:42.375 --> 01:53:46.124
The plan was alright.
The plan wouId've worked.

01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:49.207
What is it with you peopIe?

01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:52.833
You think not getting caught lying
is the same as teIling the truth?

01:53:53.417 --> 01:53:55.666
No. lt's simpIe economics.

01:53:56.167 --> 01:53:57.749
Today, its oiI.

01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:02.624
ln 1 0 or 1 5 years it'Il be food,
pIutonium. Maybe even sooner.

01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:06.332
What do you think the peopIe
wilI want us to do then?

01:54:07.792 --> 01:54:09.833
Ask them.
- Not now, then.

01:54:10.333 --> 01:54:11.916
Ask them when they're running out.

01:54:12.542 --> 01:54:16.833
Ask them when there's no heating.
When their engines stop.

01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:20.374
When people who've never
known hunger go hungry.

01:54:20.876 --> 01:54:25.791
They won't want us to ask them,
they'Il just want us to get it.

01:54:27.417 --> 01:54:28.416
Boy ...

01:54:29.542 --> 01:54:32.166
... have you found a home!

01:54:33.792 --> 01:54:36.040
7 peopIe were kiIled.
- The Company didn't order it!

01:54:36.542 --> 01:54:39.457
Atwood did.

01:54:40.876 --> 01:54:43.291
And who is Atwood?
He's alI you guys.

01:54:43.792 --> 01:54:47.916
7 peopIe kiIled.
And you pIay fucking games!

01:54:48.417 --> 01:54:52.040
Right.
And the other side does too.

01:54:52.542 --> 01:54:54.958
That's why we can't
Iet you stay outside.

01:54:55.417 --> 01:54:56.875
Go on home.

01:54:57.375 --> 01:55:00.166
Go on. They've got it.

01:55:00.667 --> 01:55:04.040
Just look around.
That's where they ship from.

01:55:06.083 --> 01:55:07.541
They've got aIl of it.

01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:19.291
What did you do?

01:55:19.792 --> 01:55:25.749
l toId them a story.
You pIay games. I told them a story.

01:55:35.876 --> 01:55:38.916
Oh, you poor dumb son of a bitch!

01:55:39.417 --> 01:55:41.875
You've done more damage than you know.

01:55:44.125 --> 01:55:45.332
l hope so.

01:55:53.876 --> 01:55:55.916
You'Il be a very IoneIy man.

01:56:00.041 --> 01:56:03.875
It didn't have to end this way.
- lf course it did.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
How do you know they'Il print it?

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:18.916
You can take a waIk
but how far if they don't print it?

01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:21.708
They'Il print it.

01:56:22.792 --> 01:56:24.207
How do you know?

01:57:08.417 --> 01:57:10.708
