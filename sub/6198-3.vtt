03:31.570 --> 03:34.410
-=Episode 3: "Kiss of Death"=-

03:36.610 --> 03:38.080
This.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.480
This, this, this. 
Just look at this face.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.320
Cause of death?

03:45.050 --> 03:47.620
We'll have to wait and see to
know for sure.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.930
But there's no obvious evidence 
of homicide.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.500
It seems like cardiac arrest.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.960
Cardiac arrest.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.800
Seonbae, you don't think so,
do you?

03:57.060 --> 04:02.300
This is not the face of someone
who died from cardiac arrest.

04:06.710 --> 04:07.810
Seonbae.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.650
What about it?

04:10.010 --> 04:12.950
Do you have any feeling like...

04:19.920 --> 04:21.019
Is it like that?

04:36.810 --> 04:37.910
The campus queen.

04:38.270 --> 04:41.580
She was the darling of the 
dance department.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.880
She had a good relationship
with the people around her,

04:44.880 --> 04:48.180
and occasionally did 
volunteer work.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.280
But...

04:49.650 --> 04:51.850
<i>Lately, she had started to 
seem nervous.</i>

04:51.850 --> 04:53.320
<i>Very anxious.</i>

04:53.320 --> 04:56.630
<i>Just like a ghost had entered her
body, talking to herself.</i>

04:56.630 --> 04:57.730
<i>She was never like that before.</i>

04:57.730 --> 04:59.560
Like a ghost had entered 
her body?

04:59.930 --> 05:01.400
Any CCTV recording?

05:01.760 --> 05:05.430
The CCTV is located in the 
hallway, so it's not much help.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.840
The last time the victim was 
seen was around 11:30 p.m.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.080
<i>Where have you been?</i>

05:16.080 --> 05:17.180
<i>Give it to me.</i>

05:17.550 --> 05:19.010
<i>What kind of person was that?</i>

05:19.010 --> 05:20.850
<i>She was so two-faced.</i>

05:21.580 --> 05:26.360
<i>She was queen of the club scene.
Everyone knew that about her.</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:28.560
What did that man bring her?

05:28.560 --> 05:32.590
Who knows? Nothing suspicious
was found in her effects.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.270
The campus queen living a 
double life.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.200
A bizarre death, a ghost, 
a suspicious man.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.300
What do you think?

05:40.300 --> 05:42.870
It's just sucking you in, isn't it?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.050
<i>Seo Min Jeong, age 23.</i>

05:52.410 --> 05:54.250
<i>She suddenly disappeared after
going to the Philippines.</i>

05:54.250 --> 05:55.350
<i>She suddenly disappeared after 
going to the Philippines.</i>

05:55.350 --> 05:58.650
But inexplicably, her body was 
found on the beach of Daebudo
Island.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.390
But inexplicably, her body was
found on the beach of Daebudo
Island.

05:59.390 --> 06:00.120
<i>She had an unexplained
abdominal surgery scar.</i>

06:00.120 --> 06:01.960
She had an unexplained
abdominal surgery scar.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.160
Unexplained surgical scar?

06:06.360 --> 06:10.400
<i>The body had been in the water
at least 15 days, </i>

06:10.400 --> 06:12.970
<i>but there was no damage or
decomposition.</i>

06:13.340 --> 06:15.900
<i>There was no sign the organs
had been removed, </i>

06:15.900 --> 06:19.570
<i>and there was no pregnancy or
apparent need for any surgery.</i>

06:19.570 --> 06:24.350
Eventually, the cause of death 
was determined to be acute 
sepsis caused by infection.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.810
What the heck is that?

06:25.810 --> 06:29.850
She went to the Philippines, had
her abdomen opened, and died
from an infection?

06:30.220 --> 06:33.160
Suppose there are other victims
who haven't been found.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.260
<i>Women of a similar age, </i>

06:34.260 --> 06:37.190
who have gone to the Phillipines
alone in the last few years,

06:37.190 --> 06:41.600
and have gone to the hospital 
with infections after they returned.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.430
We found 2 women who meet
that criteria.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.900
We found 2 women who meet
that criteria.

06:45.270 --> 06:46.740
Then, those young ladies also?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.570
No, they're alive.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.340
Pak Si Yeong is currently in 
Canada to learn English.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.540
Choe Jeong-A.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.010
She's currently in a drug 
rehab program.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.110
Drug rehab?

06:58.110 --> 06:59.580
<i>Since the late 1990s,</i>

06:59.580 --> 07:02.150
the Yeongnam gang has used
this method.

07:02.150 --> 07:05.090
Drugs are smuggled inside a
woman's abdomen.

07:05.450 --> 07:08.390
They're used to smuggle drugs
and then they die.

07:08.390 --> 07:11.330
If this is true, it's not a
simple matter.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.530
I'll start with investigating the
drug trafficking gangs.

07:13.530 --> 07:16.100
The rest of you go find out 
about our victims.

07:16.830 --> 07:19.400
First let's find out everything
we can.

07:19.400 --> 07:26.740
[chanting]

07:34.450 --> 07:36.280
The four pillars must be the same.

07:36.650 --> 07:37.750
Four pillars?
(birth day, month, year, time)

07:37.750 --> 07:40.320
A ghost can't possess just
anyone, can they?

07:41.420 --> 07:44.360
It's someone like me who is 
destined to be possessed.

07:44.730 --> 07:48.030
When a living person has a 
special fate with a dead person,

07:48.030 --> 07:51.700
and that person has the same 
birth date as the ghost,

07:51.700 --> 07:58.310
that ghost can enter the body
that has been specially selected
for possession.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.980
That's right! Seon Wu and I 
shared a special fate.

08:02.340 --> 08:06.010
Ha Yun eonni was also once 
possessed when she was young.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.950
Are our birth dates also
the same?

08:08.950 --> 08:12.250
Then in that case, shouldn't
you write a talisman?

08:12.620 --> 08:13.720
That...

08:14.820 --> 08:17.390
I will ask the General.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.340
Someone bad has possessed 
a body.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.070
Where? Where?

08:32.440 --> 08:33.179
Did he come?

08:33.539 --> 08:34.280
I don't see him.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.210
You mean me?

08:37.210 --> 08:40.520
It might make others unhappy.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.190
Just a worship dance is the best
way to go.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.650
Worship dance?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.490
How much would that cost?

08:47.490 --> 08:50.060
It should be over $1000...

08:50.430 --> 08:54.830
But I see you have a difficulty.

08:55.200 --> 09:01.070
I will ask the General how 
flexible I can be.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.270
Oh, General...

09:03.270 --> 09:04.370
<i>Hey.</i>

09:04.740 --> 09:06.940
Hey, ajussi.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.410
Do you see me?

09:08.780 --> 09:11.350
What the heck is this?

09:12.450 --> 09:14.280
Did I get hooked, too?

09:14.650 --> 09:22.360
I can take a 15% discount.
Oh, thank you, General.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.800
Right.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.370
I want to find out how to 
enter a body.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.870
~ <i>My heart is getting so excited...</i> ~

09:44.380 --> 09:46.580
Damn. Why didn't it work?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.820
What are you looking at? 
What about it?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.670
What in the world have you 
been doing?

10:06.560 --> 10:07.870
Didn't you know?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.530
That's my job, the guy that the 
beautiful people call.

10:11.540 --> 10:15.730
Aigoo. You're not awake yet,
just full of yourself.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.150
You never know with him, right?

10:18.880 --> 10:19.980
Seonbae, you know, right?

10:20.190 --> 10:22.180
Anyway, look forward to it.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.710
Loyalty.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.520
Aigoo. Look at that.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.730
Such a huge headache.

10:33.930 --> 10:37.230
With Seon Wu, was it the ring
that let me possess her?

10:37.230 --> 10:39.430
That must have had something...

10:39.800 --> 10:42.000
No. It was possible because it
was Seon Wu.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.210
Then what is it?

10:44.940 --> 10:48.240
Does it really have to do with
our birth date?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.580
Hey, well...

10:55.950 --> 10:57.420
Do you need some help?

10:58.890 --> 11:01.090
What do you want from me now?

11:01.460 --> 11:06.230
Such a jerk, doubting a young 
girl's pure intentions...

11:06.230 --> 11:08.430
Young girl's pure intentions,
my ass.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.000
Did you find anything?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.470
Yes.

11:15.770 --> 11:19.440
That night, she mainly talked
with a man named Gyeong Bin.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.910
Just look this over.

11:20.910 --> 11:21.640
Why haven't you called?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.010
Why haven't you called?

11:22.010 --> 11:24.580
Hurry and kiss me. 
I'm about to die.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.410
<i>Where are you? 
Why didn't you come?</i>

11:26.410 --> 11:28.250
<i>I can't wait any longer!</i>

11:28.250 --> 11:30.820
I just want you so bad...

11:31.190 --> 11:33.760
But after they met, they fought?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.860
Did you find out who it is?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.690
This Gyeong Bin is...

11:40.360 --> 11:41.830
Is that Gyeong Bin.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.130
Does he mean... the movie star, 
Go Gyeong Bin?

11:53.940 --> 11:55.040
What happened this time?

11:55.410 --> 12:00.550
According to our investigation,
Seo Min Jeong's death was 
related to drug smuggling.

12:00.550 --> 12:01.650
Drugs?

12:01.650 --> 12:07.160
All this time, and now you tell
me it's drug smuggling?

12:07.890 --> 12:09.360
Listen,

12:09.360 --> 12:12.290
for an ordinary college student 
to change like that overnight,

12:12.290 --> 12:13.400
does that even make sense?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.960
Maybe she needed money 
urgently.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.170
I've already told you people
many times,

12:18.170 --> 12:20.370
there was no situation like that.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.310
She didn't have a boyfriend?

12:23.670 --> 12:25.140
Not that I knew about.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.810
She was either at school 
or at home.

12:31.380 --> 12:32.480
<i>Oppa, you're home?</i>

12:32.850 --> 12:34.320
<i>Hurry, let's eat.</i>

12:36.150 --> 12:40.190
<i>When she had extra time, 
she did volunteer work.</i>

12:42.020 --> 12:44.960
She didn't say anything before 
going to the Philippines?

12:44.960 --> 12:48.260
She didn't do anything 
unusual either, did she?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.730
Right.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.150
Do you remember going to the 
Philippines and having surgery?

13:09.550 --> 13:11.750
Baby. My baby.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.850
A baby.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.160
That's where your baby 
was then?

13:17.260 --> 13:19.830
You should sit back down now.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.870
So was that baby,

13:23.870 --> 13:24.970
possibly...

13:26.070 --> 13:27.540
drugs?

13:31.570 --> 13:33.780
Who gave you those drugs?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.240
Who did this to you?

13:35.240 --> 13:36.340
If I tell you,

13:37.080 --> 13:39.280
what can you do for me?

13:39.650 --> 13:41.120
What do you want?

13:44.050 --> 13:47.720
Drugs.

13:49.190 --> 13:52.490
If it's for drugs, I would even 
sell my soul.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.700
Don't you know that?

13:55.060 --> 13:57.270
That's a little...

13:58.370 --> 13:59.830
Give them to me.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.610
Then, I will tell you which 
asshole made me like this.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.070
Well...

14:08.640 --> 14:10.110
Bring them here!

14:10.850 --> 14:14.150
I said you need to bring me
drugs right now!

14:14.150 --> 14:15.250
Someone!

14:19.290 --> 14:21.860
Oh wait, wait!

14:30.300 --> 14:32.870
What are you running around
investigating?

14:34.340 --> 14:36.170
How did you find out?

14:36.170 --> 14:38.370
Other detectives have 
been calling.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.410
Talk is cheap.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.350
There's nobody who's suspicious?

14:45.350 --> 14:48.650
There's someone very suspicious, 
but nothing solid.

14:48.650 --> 14:54.890
My source says there have been 
parties where someone is pushing 
an unknown drug.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.830
Aigoo. You jerk, I should...

14:57.830 --> 14:58.930
Damn it.

14:58.930 --> 15:02.230
Drugs aren't easily smuggled in.
Does that make any sense?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.530
It may not sound likely, but...

15:05.530 --> 15:08.840
the fact that their usual sales 
have taken a big drop lately,

15:08.840 --> 15:12.140
would suggest it isn't entirely 
unfounded.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.710
We're just grasping at straws now.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.540
Seriously.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.920
Our victims were all members of
the same volunteer organization.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.600
In their phone records, I found 
a common number.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.330
A woman named Choe Gyeong Mi.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.630
There's no man?

15:35.630 --> 15:36.730
What?

15:37.830 --> 15:43.340
The victims all had boyfriends 
they didn't tell their families about.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.010
Hold on.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.780
Isn't that the same house
and the same car?

15:51.780 --> 15:55.820
She went to the Philippines 
around the time she started 
dating this man.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.650
That's weird.

15:58.020 --> 16:01.320
Then some phone number here
should be the same.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.630
We can't see the license plate.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.560
This photo isn't very helpful.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.230
No. It is actually useful.

16:11.600 --> 16:16.000
Here, this is the instrument 
panel of an SQ Martin.
(Aston Martin)

16:16.370 --> 16:17.840
It's even the limited edition.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.040
It's a British-made super car.

16:20.040 --> 16:23.340
It's not well known here, so 
there should only be a few.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.690
He keeps changing his phone
number, so he's hard to find.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.620
It's Go Gyeong Bin, the actor.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.760
Wasn't I right?
Is he filming a movie here?

16:39.860 --> 16:42.430
Why are you hanging around 
and annoying me?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.900
I'm your partner!

16:44.270 --> 16:49.400
Honestly, who else would be 
your partner? If you don't want 
to be alone forever,

16:49.400 --> 16:50.870
you should try making friends.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.710
Don't be a know-it-all.

16:52.850 --> 16:57.850
Be quiet. So find out Ha Yun 
eonni's birthday, not just the day,
but the year and the time.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.950
Okay?

17:00.420 --> 17:05.920
Hey. Why do you want to know
what time she was born?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.839
You should at least know 
that detail!

17:10.329 --> 17:14.730
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Go Gyeong Bin is?

17:14.730 --> 17:17.300
Gyeong Bin? He's up on 
the 2nd floor.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.069
It's Dong Gun oppa!

17:23.170 --> 17:25.740
That brat, seriously.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.730
If you suddenly cut me off, 
what am I going to do?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.660
Do you want money?

17:46.660 --> 17:48.130
Or a woman?

17:49.600 --> 17:51.070
Whatever you want. 
Just tell me.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.170
I'll give it to you.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.100
Please. Please give me the drug.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.570
Tell me to do and I'll do it.

17:56.570 --> 18:00.610
Tell me to die and I'll die. 
Call me a dog and I'll be a dog.
Please just give it to me!

19:01.900 --> 19:03.740
Ha Yun eonni!

19:53.290 --> 19:54.760
Go Gyeong Bin!

19:55.490 --> 19:58.060
Stay there a minute.
Let's talk.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.370
Stop!

20:38.070 --> 20:40.270
Seo Min Jeong's smuggling and 
death,

20:40.270 --> 20:43.200
is likely related to Go Gyeong Bin 
and this matter.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.410
I know I've seen this before.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.440
In the orphanage photo, it was
Choe Gyeong Bin, right?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.750
In other words, we're 
investigating the same case.

20:53.110 --> 20:56.780
Is this good news or bad news?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.720
Their expressions are the same.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.560
It looks like they were scared.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.360
This is different from the types 
of drugs we normally see.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.560
It's purity is more than 80%.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.870
Once poisoned, you either die 
from the side effects or die of 
muscle spasms.

21:44.870 --> 21:49.270
Either way, it's an agonizing death.
This is a very evil drug.

21:49.270 --> 21:55.000
If this kind of drug circulates in 
the public, it could be terrible.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.020
So, was there anything else?

21:58.450 --> 22:02.120
Both of them had extremely
high adrenaline levels.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.790
Adrenaline can be very high
when under stress, then...

22:05.790 --> 22:07.260
That's why it's odd.

22:07.260 --> 22:12.390
After taking the drug, their 
adrenaline should go down 
instead of up.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.470
Detective Yun, what do you 
think about this case?

22:20.470 --> 22:21.940
What about you?

22:21.940 --> 22:25.970
It's pretty clear they died from 
side effects of the drug,

22:27.070 --> 22:28.540
but I'm still worried.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.750
Their expression when they died,

22:31.480 --> 22:34.050
what were they imagining that
was so frightening?

22:34.050 --> 22:35.880
We can't say for sure yet.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.190
In any case,

22:39.190 --> 22:43.960
with Go Gyeong Bin's death,
the link between Choe Gyeong Mi 
and Seo Min Jeong is broken.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.260
From now on, let's re-investigate
everyone around them.

22:47.630 --> 22:48.730
Okay.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.910
-=Choe Jeong-A=-

22:58.270 --> 23:00.110
-=Pak Si Yeong=-

23:00.470 --> 23:03.780
Anyone who knew Choe Gyeong 
Mi well has vanished.

23:04.150 --> 23:09.650
This woman and these other 
girls were at Go Gyeong Bin's
house, right?

23:13.690 --> 23:16.620
What are you talking about?
Not a thief, like a student.

23:16.620 --> 23:16.990
Bastard.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.660
<i>It was a student.</i>

23:23.230 --> 23:25.070
Stop. Go back a little bit.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.190
Stop. Play it.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.000
-=Accomplice? Suspect?=-

23:45.810 --> 23:47.460
<i>Explain it all simply.</i>

23:47.460 --> 23:47.490
<i>Explain it all simply.</i>

23:47.490 --> 23:48.190
-=Choe Gyeong Mi=-

23:48.470 --> 23:50.660
Choe Gyeong Mi was targeted.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.330
After a closer relationship, she 
was introduced to Go Gyeong Bin.

23:53.330 --> 23:55.530
Go Gyeong Bin and the victim 
started dating.

23:55.530 --> 23:58.470
Gradually, they started taking 
drugs and smuggling drugs.

23:58.830 --> 24:02.140
During this process, 
Seo Min Jeong died.

24:02.140 --> 24:08.380
These men used ordinary female 
students as drug mules, following
which they died.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.840
What about the man filmed
at the scene?

24:09.840 --> 24:11.680
We haven't identified him yet.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.980
I don't know the details,

24:15.350 --> 24:20.490
but there's someone throwing
parties and passing out drugs.

24:20.490 --> 24:24.160
Do they just take the drugs and
die, or also smuggle drugs?

24:24.160 --> 24:25.990
<i>That can't be.</i>

24:25.990 --> 24:30.030
But then again, there are all kinds of
weird people these days, right?

24:31.130 --> 24:32.600
Isn't it strange?

24:32.970 --> 24:37.740
After using drugs at the same 
party, 2 people shouldn't have
died.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.210
Well...

24:39.570 --> 24:43.980
from the beginning, I thought
maybe Seo Min Jeong died with
a grudge.

24:44.350 --> 24:48.380
<i>Couldn't she? Then a witness 
said Choe Gyeong Mi acted like
a ghost was inside her.</i>

24:48.380 --> 24:52.790
Go Gyeong Bin jumped off a
building in front of everyone 
like a ghost was chasing him.

24:52.790 --> 24:56.460
First we need to identify this
suspect so we can find out.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.960
See. See. This Go Gyeong Bin 
thing, reporters are going crazy.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.060
I'm sorry.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.000
Try to hurry up before they tie
you hand and foot.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.470
No. No.

25:07.470 --> 25:11.140
We don't have anything to tell
them now, so I should cooperate.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.440
I want them to see how hard 
we're working on this.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.480
My goodness, Reporter Choe!

25:18.480 --> 25:20.680
<i>That's right.</i>

25:23.250 --> 25:27.290
8-8-0-6.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.860
A little more. A little more.

25:30.470 --> 25:31.330
I quit!

25:31.690 --> 25:32.790
Everyone come here and look!

25:33.160 --> 25:34.260
What?

25:39.030 --> 25:41.600
Someone has just accessed 
Go Gyeong Bin's email.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.070
What are you talking about?

25:43.800 --> 25:48.210
A dead person logged in to his 
email, read the spam mail and left.

25:48.210 --> 25:51.150
First, track the IP address and 
see who's doing this.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.250
Hurry, kid.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.590
<i>Yang Hyeon Su, a 4th year at
Yeongindae Law School.</i>

25:59.590 --> 26:02.890
<i>Tracking his phone shows he's
currently in school. </i>

26:09.100 --> 26:11.330
There's so much eye candy here.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.530
<i>Okay, everybody stop!</i>

26:13.900 --> 26:16.840
Who is Yang Hyeon Su?

26:16.840 --> 26:17.570
Who are you guys?

26:17.940 --> 26:19.410
I think you already know.

26:19.770 --> 26:23.440
Then you're going to run out
this way to escape.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.750
Oh, man.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.720
Are you guys sure you really 
want to do this?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.520
You're not letting go?

26:31.520 --> 26:33.350
Seonbaenim, what should we do?

26:33.350 --> 26:34.460
Hold onto him for now.

26:34.820 --> 26:35.920
Hold him tightly.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.230
Boys, let's not make things
complicated.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.510
It's just like a movie!

27:01.250 --> 27:04.190
This fight is so much fun!

27:17.770 --> 27:19.970
Why did you read a dead 
person's email?

27:21.070 --> 27:24.000
On the news, they said that
Gyeong Bin had died.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.940
But I had heard that there 
would be an F-1 party today.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.410
F-1?

27:28.780 --> 27:32.450
Then, Choe Gyeong Mi and
Go Gyeong Bin were also F-1
members, right?

27:32.450 --> 27:33.910
Yes.

27:33.910 --> 27:36.120
They may not have been born 
with a golden spoon,

27:36.480 --> 27:38.320
but at least a silver one.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.630
<i>Who is she? Do you know?</i>

27:52.630 --> 27:54.470
<i>She was in some of the ads for
our company.</i>

27:54.470 --> 27:55.570
<i>Whatever.</i>

27:55.940 --> 27:59.240
<i>Hey, Han Sang Min.
Long time no see.</i>

28:00.710 --> 28:03.640
<i>I told you, right? He's really 
Sun Group's second son.</i>

28:08.050 --> 28:10.620
<i>Whatever. Let's go.</i>

28:15.020 --> 28:17.590
<i>I also have an actor wrapped
around this.</i>

28:18.690 --> 28:20.160
<i>You get it, right?</i>

28:22.000 --> 28:24.200
<i>I guess I made a mistake.</i>

28:25.300 --> 28:26.770
<i>What did you just say?</i>

28:26.770 --> 28:28.240
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:28.600 --> 28:31.170
<i>- I said, what did you just say?
- Let's go!</i>

28:32.270 --> 28:33.370
<i>Don't be like this!</i>

28:35.580 --> 28:36.680
<i>Am I a joke to you?</i>

28:36.680 --> 28:38.150
<i>I said let's go!</i>

28:44.750 --> 28:45.490
<i>Let go of me!</i>

28:46.590 --> 28:48.060
<i>Are you looking down on me?</i>

28:48.420 --> 28:49.520
<i>Go Gyeong Bin.</i>

28:53.560 --> 28:55.760
<i>We came here for some fun.</i>

28:57.600 --> 28:58.700
<i>Let's go.</i>

29:06.770 --> 29:08.610
<i>Have a good time.</i>

29:08.980 --> 29:13.380
They loved to bully people,

29:13.380 --> 29:15.580
but hurt their pride even more.

29:15.950 --> 29:19.620
Right. They wanted to make 
those guys come to them instead.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.460
So they decided to throw the 
F-1 parties.

29:25.860 --> 29:31.370
<i>Anyway, to be invited to the party
meant you had some status. </i>

29:31.730 --> 29:35.400
<i>Therefore, everyone would have 
to kiss up to an F-1 member.</i>

29:36.500 --> 29:40.540
Put simply, the first party had
the top 1% of society there.

30:12.470 --> 30:14.680
I went to one of the parties
with Gyeong Bin.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.610
Since you went to the party, 
you must know who the F-1
member was.

30:17.610 --> 30:20.910
I wasn't qualified enough to 
know him.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.790
I only caught a glimpse. He 
looked a bit like my classmate.

30:27.150 --> 30:29.360
Gil Han Hospital director's son.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.560
His name...

30:33.030 --> 30:35.230
is it Jeong Do Yeong?

30:35.230 --> 30:37.060
Where are the parties held?

30:37.060 --> 30:41.470
The party locations are random.
They send out invitations.

30:51.380 --> 30:55.420
Gyeong Bin's number is 001.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.250
Password is...

30:57.990 --> 31:00.190
-=Cube: Top Domestic Poker
Biggest Pot=-

31:02.020 --> 31:06.060
If you take a picture of this with
your phone and send it, then
they will send your invitation.

31:21.110 --> 31:24.040
-=Date: August 29, 2015. 
Time: 23:00. Place : Gyeonggi-do 
Nanyang State Eldorado 619-47=-

32:03.680 --> 32:06.250
That kid really looks suspicious
to me.

32:06.990 --> 32:09.920
How does a police officer get to
borrow that kind of car?

32:56.540 --> 32:57.640
We're in.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.740
Okay.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.680
Stay sharp and don't let 
anything happen.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.670
What are you doing?

33:31.040 --> 33:32.510
Let's go play.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.080
What's wrong? Come on.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.580
I see the target. 
Working my way over.

33:49.390 --> 33:51.220
I'm sorry.

34:20.949 --> 34:25.360
Even if you do this, will you 
upstarts be able to join the
royal family?

34:27.190 --> 34:30.130
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

34:30.500 --> 34:34.530
You think we're not good enough
and only get in your way, right?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.370
So you killed them?

34:36.739 --> 34:38.210
Gyeong Mi and Gyeong Bin!

34:38.940 --> 34:40.770
So you killed them?

34:43.710 --> 34:44.810
Wow.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.010
Things are really getting
interesting.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.480
=You're laughing?=

34:49.219 --> 34:50.679
=Did you do it?=

34:50.679 --> 34:53.620
Did you think I would sit still?

35:06.830 --> 35:11.970
Do you really think I killed them,
or this...

35:12.710 --> 35:14.540
because of this drug?

35:21.150 --> 35:24.450
Nobody killed those kids.

35:25.920 --> 35:30.320
They died because they 
were stupid.

35:39.130 --> 35:42.070
Just like you are now.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.850
What's going on?

36:05.190 --> 36:07.760
Somehow, these non-members
got in.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.270
Move right now!

36:18.410 --> 36:19.510
<i>What?</i>

36:34.190 --> 36:35.660
Ajussi, hurry!

36:36.760 --> 36:38.230
Things are getting more 
dangerous!

36:49.970 --> 36:51.810
<i>The suspect is escaping!</i>

36:52.170 --> 36:53.640
=He's getting close to the 
highway!=

37:05.750 --> 37:07.590
Hurry and confirm Jeong Do 
Yeong's identity.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.280
<i>Lee Jae Hun.</i>

38:43.020 --> 38:43.380
He went to a resort in the
Philippines to meet his father.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.480
He went to a resort in the
Philippines to meet his father.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.590
He went to a resort in the
Philippines to meet his father.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.050
He went to the Philippines
many times.

38:47.420 --> 38:50.720
This is probably when they laid
the foundation for smuggling.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.290
When Seo Min Jeong's body was
found on Daebu Island,

38:53.290 --> 38:54.030
we confirmed there was a villa
under his father's name.

38:54.030 --> 38:56.010
we confirmed there was a villa
under his father's name.

38:56.230 --> 38:57.700
It's probably where the surgery
was done to extract the drugs.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.900
It's probably where the surgery
was done to extract the drugs.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.470
Search carefully and see if there
are any pills.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.010
Yes.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.870
<i>We searched the crime scene
once again, </i>

39:06.870 --> 39:08.710
<i>but didn't find any similar pills.</i>

39:08.710 --> 39:12.010
We did everything according
to protocol.

39:12.750 --> 39:13.480
The ones passed out at the 
party were weak.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.680
The ones passed out at the
party were weak.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.990
Chemical analysis showed the
drug that killed Jeong Do Yeong,

39:18.990 --> 39:22.290
and the one Detective Han 
brought back were different.

39:22.290 --> 39:25.590
The drugs passed out at the
party weren't very strong.

39:25.590 --> 39:28.900
But why would Lee Jae Hun 
kill a member?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.100
What if he no longer needed to
smuggle it in?

39:31.100 --> 39:34.030
He must now be able to 
manufacture his own drugs.

39:34.030 --> 39:38.070
That's why after Seo Min Jeong, 
there were no more victims.

39:38.070 --> 39:42.840
In addition, he's uncomfortable
because of his inferiority complex.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.050
What does that mean?

39:45.050 --> 39:46.150
Inferiority complex?

39:46.150 --> 39:49.820
He got famous people to be 
submissive to him.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.490
Whenever he saw them, he
thought of how they treated him
in the past.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.950
Would that make him comfortable?

39:55.320 --> 39:57.520
Oh, this is like that!

39:57.520 --> 39:59.730
The Chinese idiom:
Rabbit dead, dog cooks.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.560
Rabbit dead, dog cooks.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.500
Really!

40:04.500 --> 40:05.970
I was kidding! Just kidding!

40:06.330 --> 40:08.170
Don't you know by now?

40:09.270 --> 40:10.740
Is it really dog cooking?

40:14.410 --> 40:15.880
Anyway, we should question him.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.900
We heard it all yesterday.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.080
Lee Jae Hun gave him the drugs.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.180
Is eavesdropping evidence?

40:19.180 --> 40:23.580
Has anyone come forward to say
Lee Jae Hun passes out drugs?

40:26.150 --> 40:29.090
We don't have anything in 
our hands.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.920
We know it, but we can't
prove it.

40:31.290 --> 40:34.960
To keep him from escaping for 
now, we should apply for a 
travel restriction...

40:34.960 --> 40:36.800
He's not trying to escape.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.000
I've been tracking his position, 
and he's in school.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.300
This bastard kills people and just
goes back to school.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.240
I already knew he wasn't an 
ordinary person.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.440
He must either be a psychopath 
or a sociopath.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.640
Are we just going to sit here?

40:50.010 --> 40:52.950
Let's at least arrest him or 
investigate him or something!

40:52.950 --> 40:54.780
I'll go do it.

40:55.150 --> 40:56.250
What?

40:57.720 --> 41:01.020
What's this? What? What is 
she going to do now?

41:02.860 --> 41:06.160
What are you doing? 
Go with her and find out.

41:25.720 --> 41:28.230
Please refer to the information 
on the list of these books.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.450
Lee Jae Hun?

41:32.220 --> 41:34.420
Could we talk for a moment?

41:36.990 --> 41:39.190
Student, can't you see there's
a class going on?

41:40.100 --> 41:41.560
I'm a police officer.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.840
So... you mean unknowingly,

41:50.000 --> 41:55.710
I smuggled drugs and killed my
friend, is that right?

41:58.060 --> 42:00.380
I was wrong to do that.

42:03.790 --> 42:06.050
Did you think that's what I'd do?

42:06.160 --> 42:08.560
I see your fighting spirit is intact.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.760
First, should we do a drug test?

42:10.760 --> 42:15.900
You don't have enough evidence,
so you have to ask for it?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.010
You should have asked before.

42:19.110 --> 42:20.370
Ow, that hurts.

42:21.770 --> 42:24.700
Here. Will that do?

42:24.750 --> 42:27.270
Shouldn't you try giving her
some advice?

42:27.290 --> 42:29.860
She'll get discouraged like this.

42:30.210 --> 42:33.880
In the beginning, hitting a wall 
isn't always a bad thing.

42:34.110 --> 42:36.820
Isn't that the process of 
becoming a real detective?

42:36.820 --> 42:38.280
Process, my ass.

42:38.650 --> 42:39.750
I'm all tingly.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.960
Is it hard being so cool?

42:46.730 --> 42:48.930
How can someone have no
facial expression?

42:48.930 --> 42:50.400
As a person, he should...

42:50.400 --> 42:53.700
I should... As a person, I should.

42:53.700 --> 42:58.100
But society doesn't require moral 
character in a leader.

42:59.570 --> 43:02.880
Next time, please speak with
my lawyer.

43:05.810 --> 43:11.680
If you try spreading baseless 
rumors or personal attacks again,

43:12.420 --> 43:14.990
I won't overlook it.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.370
What are you doing?

43:26.370 --> 43:27.470
Follow him,

43:27.470 --> 43:29.300
- Partner.
- Partner?

43:31.140 --> 43:34.440
You're only nice when you need
me. Your shitty manners.

43:34.440 --> 43:35.540
Fine.

43:35.910 --> 43:37.740
Then you have to find out 
Ha Yun eonni's birthdate for me.

43:37.740 --> 43:38.850
Got it?

43:50.590 --> 43:54.260
Statistics show 92% of people 
in the drug trade are addicts.

43:57.930 --> 43:59.030
I'm sorry.

44:00.130 --> 44:01.600
No. Forget it.

44:01.970 --> 44:04.540
Thanks to you, we found 
another clue.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.310
Lee Jae Hun has a tattoo on
his shoulder.

44:09.450 --> 44:12.060
You can see part of it under 
his short sleeves,

44:12.360 --> 44:17.020
but the person in the photo, 
even with the sleeves rolled up,
you can't see a tattoo.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.950
He's right-handed, since his 
watch is on the left hand.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.050
Then...

44:21.050 --> 44:22.890
The killer of Choe Gyeong Mi 
and Go Gyeong Bin

44:23.260 --> 44:26.560
wasn't Lee Jae Hun, but very 
likely a third party.

44:29.130 --> 44:30.600
Hey, Dog Nose!

44:32.070 --> 44:33.170
Dog Nose!

44:46.010 --> 44:49.680
The drug manufacturing method
was already posted online,

44:49.680 --> 44:51.880
but there are a lot of complaints
here that it doesn't work.

44:52.250 --> 44:55.920
Someone claimed they were 
able to have specialists test it.

44:56.290 --> 45:00.690
<i>In that case, some people tried 
it and ended up breathing toxic
fumes.</i>

45:00.690 --> 45:02.160
<i>Some even got arrested.</i>

45:02.160 --> 45:02.530
<i>Some even got arrested.</i>

45:02.530 --> 45:05.470
<i>But then the thread terminator
claimed it was just bait.</i>

45:05.470 --> 45:05.830
<i>But then the thread terminator
claimed it was just bait.</i>

45:05.830 --> 45:08.770
After that, they posted the real
manufacturing method.

45:09.870 --> 45:12.070
Although it was quickly 
taken down,

45:12.440 --> 45:15.010
a screenshot of it is spreading.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.880
The first time the drugs were 
smuggled was 3 months ago.

45:20.880 --> 45:25.650
Have Tae Gyeong check the IP
address of who posted it and 
the thread terminator IP.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.960
Yes, the one who posted it was
Lee Jae Hun.

45:29.320 --> 45:34.460
The thread terminator IP is a 
research lab in South Korea.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.300
A South Korean research lab?

45:53.180 --> 45:54.280
Excuse me.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.120
Is there something wrong?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.220
We're the police.

45:57.220 --> 45:58.690
We need to confirm something.

46:00.150 --> 46:03.460
There should be pictures we 
keep for laboratory use.

46:04.190 --> 46:05.660
Here you are.

46:05.660 --> 46:06.760
Thank you.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.540
This person.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.110
What? Do you know him?

46:28.050 --> 46:29.520
Go on in.

46:33.550 --> 46:39.430
<i>Oh, Chang Min seonbae. While 
finishing his PhD in chemistry,
he was a teaching assistant.</i>

46:39.430 --> 46:43.100
I heard that he needed money
and was worried about getting
a job.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.970
Beginning last July 8th,

46:48.970 --> 46:49.340
Beginning last July 8th,

46:49.340 --> 46:50.800
Lee Jae Hun has transferred 
large sums of money to Seo 
Chang Min's account.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.640
Lee Jae Hun has transferred
large sums of money to Seo
Chang Min's account.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.840
The amount was growing.

46:54.840 --> 46:58.140
After Seo Min Jeong went missing 
in April, it temporarily stopped,

46:58.140 --> 47:01.080
but started again in mid-June.

47:10.620 --> 47:12.460
-=Name: Choe Jeong-A, age 21. 
Career: University student.
Philippines studies=-

47:16.130 --> 47:17.960
-=Name: Choe Gyeong Mi. 
Got Min Jeong addicted F1. 
Decisive person. Age: 21.=-

47:27.510 --> 47:28.980
Could it be?

47:59.810 --> 48:02.380
We have a lot of things to discuss.

48:03.840 --> 48:08.610
Okay. Then I'll see you at the
workshop tomorrow night.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.820
Okay.

48:13.390 --> 48:16.320
Okay! Undercover work done.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.300
-=Biography: Seo Chang Min=-

48:23.300 --> 48:24.400
<i>I mean, able to make and actually 
make are two different things.</i>

48:24.400 --> 48:27.700
<i>I mean, able to make and actually
make are two different things.</i>

48:28.070 --> 48:29.900
<i>Sorry. I have another class.</i>

48:30.640 --> 48:32.840
<i>I heard you're studying for 
your PhD.</i>

48:33.940 --> 48:38.340
<i>But if I were to upload this and 
expose you, could you still 
become a professor?</i>

48:38.340 --> 48:43.480
<i>If anyone follows all of this, 
how many kids might get hurt?</i>

48:43.480 --> 48:44.220
<i>What are you up to?</i>

48:44.220 --> 48:46.420
<i>You said you could do it.</i>

48:48.620 --> 48:53.760
<i>Just this once, prove it.</i>

48:58.160 --> 49:02.570
<i>See? I told you that you'd 
be back, right?</i>

49:03.670 --> 49:08.810
<i>A man cannot ignore someone
who appreciates his ability.</i>

49:14.680 --> 49:20.550
<i>I'm really looking forward to how 
much we can do next time,</i>

49:20.550 --> 49:22.390
<i>Hyeongnim.</i>

49:40.370 --> 49:44.410
<i>Don't work anymore. 
Go somewhere and have fun.</i>

49:44.780 --> 49:45.510
<i>What is this?</i>

49:45.510 --> 49:48.450
<i>The professor helped me find a 
nice temp job.</i>

49:48.450 --> 49:49.920
<i>The pay isn't bad and the
hours are flexible.</i>

49:49.920 --> 49:51.020
<i>The pay isn't bad and the
hours are flexible.</i>

49:51.020 --> 49:53.590
<i>It's still just a temporary job.</i>

49:53.590 --> 49:57.620
<i>Oppa, don't do this. We really 
need to try and save money.</i>

49:59.090 --> 50:00.560
<i>Just trust me. </i>

50:01.660 --> 50:05.330
<i>I'll make sure you never have
to worry about money again.</i>

50:05.700 --> 50:07.900
<i>Let's just get through this week,
okay?</i>

50:10.470 --> 50:14.870
<i>Truthfully, it's very difficult to 
further improve the quality.</i>

50:15.980 --> 50:20.750
<i>The reality is that we have to 
cooperate.</i>

50:21.110 --> 50:24.780
<i>It's difficult to get what I need
in this country.</i>

50:24.780 --> 50:28.090
<i>Whatever you need, 
just let me know.</i>

50:28.090 --> 50:30.660
<i>I'll get it from overseas for you.</i>

51:09.560 --> 51:10.660
<i>Over here.</i>

51:12.130 --> 51:13.600
<i>What have you been doing lately?</i>

51:13.700 --> 51:15.960
<i>Just what the hell have you 
been doing?</i>

51:28.280 --> 51:30.480
<i>I heard him say his sister had
gone crazy.</i>

51:30.850 --> 51:33.050
I didn't know how hard it was
for him.

51:33.420 --> 51:38.190
After his sister went missing, 
he also quickly disappeared.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.030
This isn't just for revenge.

51:40.030 --> 51:45.160
Seo Min Jeong got addicted to 
the new drug Seo Chang Min 
had made.

51:55.440 --> 51:57.640
<i>Give me the drug! </i>

51:57.640 --> 51:59.850
<i>Give it to me!</i>

52:06.450 --> 52:08.650
<i>I'm your only sister!</i>

52:19.300 --> 52:20.400
<i>Min Jeong!</i>

52:20.770 --> 52:21.870
<i>Min Jeong!</i>

52:23.700 --> 52:24.800
<i>Min Jeong!</i>

52:29.210 --> 52:30.310
<i>Min Jeong!</i>

52:56.370 --> 53:02.610
<i>Min Jeong! Min Jeong!</i>

53:13.620 --> 53:15.450
Has Seo Chang Min been
found yet?

53:15.820 --> 53:18.020
His phone is still turned off.

53:18.020 --> 53:23.900
His desire for revenge is related
to his guilty conscience over his
sister dying from this drug.

53:23.900 --> 53:27.930
I think after he kills Lee Jae Hun, 
he plans to commit suicide.

53:28.300 --> 53:31.240
But Lee Jae Hun, wouldn't he be
aware of Seo Chang Min's plan?

53:31.240 --> 53:32.710
I should think he would, right?

53:32.710 --> 53:35.640
He's probably thinking of ways
to dispose of Seo Chang Min.

53:35.640 --> 53:39.680
One party wants to cut off their 
tail, and the other one wants
revenge.

53:40.050 --> 53:43.350
Which party gets eaten first is
the battle, right?

53:44.450 --> 53:47.020
Is the information accurate that
these two are meeting tonight?

53:47.020 --> 53:48.490
Yes.

53:49.590 --> 53:52.160
Drugs have destroyed too 
many people.

53:52.530 --> 53:54.360
But I kind of understand.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.930
Being possessed is like a drug.

53:57.300 --> 54:01.330
Once you try it, you can't help
wanting to do it again.

54:01.700 --> 54:03.900
You little brat.

54:03.900 --> 54:07.210
Is the reason you want to know 
about the birthdate because...

54:07.210 --> 54:10.140
A promise is a promise. 
Don't even think about reneging.

54:12.340 --> 54:13.810
Is Lee Jae Hun at home yet?

54:13.810 --> 54:16.530
Yes. Not long ago, we got a text
he was still in the house.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.480
Okay.

54:21.890 --> 54:24.090
We're not a funeral home.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.290
How long are we going to 
collect dead bodies?

54:26.290 --> 54:27.390
Let's go.

54:39.140 --> 54:42.070
Jong Hyeon, you can withdraw
and I'll take over.

54:55.290 --> 54:58.220
It seems like he's just driving 
around and around.

54:58.590 --> 54:59.690
Hey, Jeong Ha Yun.

55:00.060 --> 55:01.530
The tracking is working, right?

55:01.890 --> 55:03.000
Yes.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.100
The signal seems normal.

55:20.610 --> 55:21.710
Hey, Detective Jeong.

55:21.710 --> 55:23.180
I lost him.

55:24.650 --> 55:26.120
The signal has disappeared!

55:26.490 --> 55:27.590
=What?=

55:28.690 --> 55:30.520
I knew this would happen.

56:00.250 --> 56:03.190
So I guess this place is their
factory.

56:15.300 --> 56:16.770
Ajussi!

56:17.140 --> 56:19.340
What? He's still not back?

56:19.340 --> 56:21.170
No matter what, you'd 
better find him!

56:21.270 --> 56:22.270
Understand?

56:22.270 --> 56:23.380
Team leader!

56:24.840 --> 56:28.510
Lee Jae Hun's phone GPS is 
showing a very strange place.

56:28.510 --> 56:29.480
Like what?

56:29.790 --> 56:30.850
Look at this.

56:31.020 --> 56:35.850
Several times now, it's just 
staying in the middle of the road.

56:35.850 --> 56:37.690
That's right! It's here!

56:37.820 --> 56:38.790
Underground.

56:38.820 --> 56:40.440
Where is the correct position?

56:46.370 --> 56:47.600
Wait!

56:47.770 --> 56:49.800
Where is the correct position?

56:49.940 --> 56:51.640
Why did it happen now?

56:52.740 --> 56:54.940
Ajussi, it's an abandoned
subway station!

57:00.080 --> 57:01.180
Ajussi?

57:01.910 --> 57:03.750
She said there's an abandoned
subway station there!

57:04.120 --> 57:05.220
What? Just a minute!

57:23.570 --> 57:27.970
It's really such a shame.

57:38.620 --> 57:44.120
I came to discuss a settlement, 
so don't look at me like that.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.360
To be honest, it is a shame.

57:52.200 --> 57:55.130
I didn't want to let him die easily,

57:55.130 --> 57:58.800
but to torture him for as 
long as possible.

57:58.800 --> 58:01.740
After that, I wanted to kill
him myself.

58:04.310 --> 58:10.550
Did you think you could also 
make Do Yeong kill me?

58:11.280 --> 58:12.750
Hey, isn't that going too far?

58:13.120 --> 58:14.950
The two of us aren't strangers.

58:17.890 --> 58:23.400
<i>If you don't strike first, you'll end
up like Gyeong Mi and Gyeong Bin.</i>

58:23.400 --> 58:25.230
<i>You must strike first.</i>

58:27.070 --> 58:32.570
<i>Then all of this...
will be yours. </i>

58:38.440 --> 58:40.280
That would have been nice.

58:42.110 --> 58:43.220
Look forward to it.

58:45.050 --> 58:47.990
I will make sure you die 
in misery.

58:49.450 --> 58:59.360
All of you will be addicted and 
abandoned like dogs, just like
my Min Jeong.

59:03.770 --> 59:05.970
You still don't understand me.

59:06.340 --> 59:12.210
You think I deliberately got
Seo Min Jeong addicted?

59:33.130 --> 59:36.440
We were just having fun at
a party!

59:36.800 --> 59:39.000
<i>What could I do if that's how
they party?</i>

59:39.370 --> 59:40.470
Stop your bullshit.

59:40.470 --> 59:48.910
Then, it must be that Min Jeong 
got addicted because her brother
made such a great drug, right?

59:49.280 --> 59:50.380
You asshole.

59:52.220 --> 59:54.050
Let's be reasonable.

59:54.050 --> 59:56.260
You can't change what's done.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.720
The living must continue to live.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.490
Especially since you are so
extremely talented,

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.430
you should live a long time.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.870
Where were the drugs 
manufactured before?

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.480
I... brought money.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.520
This should be enough.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.190
We can settle it this time, right?

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:31.860
<i>Stop.</i>

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.830
Stop!

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.680
I didn't want it to get this far.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.403
<i>Oh, Ha Yun!</i>

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.330
Hey, I guess we think alike, right?

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.800
Think alike, my ass!

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.240
What about your ass?

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.720
Are you alone? 
What about ajussi?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:44.530
Let's go.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.200
Where are you going?

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.040
Ajussi should go with us!

01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:59.990
Don't move!

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.320
Get out quickly.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.220
Let's get out of here!

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:11.690
I said don't move!

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.450
Come on.

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.020
Come on.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.260
Then I will kill you again.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.440
Stay away!

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.750
Stay away!

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.710
Min Jeong.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:50.250
Min Jeong.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.550
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:56.490
You must be in pain.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.420
I'm sorry.

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.730
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.010
What about the kids?

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.530
Hey, Kid.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:44.940
Team leader, I crapped my pants.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.770
Oh my god!

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:48.970
Oh, seriously!

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.440
Clean him up.

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.750
Hey. Hey, Kid.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.460
Hey.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.250
You scared me!

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.060
<i>- Hey, come to your senses! </i>
- Mom.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.890
-=Mom=-

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:11.730
Is she gone?

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:12.830
Is who gone?

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.670
She came.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.340
Seo Min Jeong's ghost.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:19.800
What?

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:21.640
Hello, Mother!

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.110
This is Ha Yun!

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:27.150
Could you please tell me what
my four pillars are?

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.230
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:48.430
What am I doing here?

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:50.270
What happened?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.100
Why did I come out again?

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:55.770
I still had some questions to ask!

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.980
<i>Miss, why are you doing this?</i>

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.280
<i>You're not secretly videotaping
this, are you?</i>

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:13.020
<i>When people with the same
four pillars meet, </i>

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:17.800
<i>they get along very well and
even a dead branch will flower
once a week. </i>

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:26.970
<i>But, balance must be maintained.</i>

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:31.740
<i>If they tilt toward one side, 
they can be swallowed up.</i>

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.050
What the heck?

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:38.350
I was completely fooled by 
a faker.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.090
It's been a long time, 
Department Chief Gang.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.029
You're looking very well.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:24.229
Because I haven't see your
face in so long.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.060
Thanks to you.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.569
The Devil's lawyer, Han Gyu 
Hyeong.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:07.170
For enough money, he'll get 
someone out of hell and send
them to heaven.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.149
We need to focus on our goal,
and add another one.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.330
-=Next Episode Preview=-

<i>Yun Se-A was reborn.</i>

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.000
<i>The Korean version of 
"Melancholy Sunday."</i>

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.250
<i>After hearing her song, 10 people
have committed suicide. </i>

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.730
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:01.590
<i>Shut up.</i>

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.680
<i>In any case, I think there should 
be an accomplice.</i>

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.020
<i>Bastard, I told you to stay close!</i>

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.430
<i>I heard your contract with Yun 
Se-A was about to expire.</i>

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.800

<i>I'm no longer that singer.
I'm an actor! </i>

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.170
<i>It seems like those two quarrelled.</i>

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.520
<i>Everything was screwed up 
because of this.</i>

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:19.950
<i>This time is really the last time.</i>

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.520
<i>Isn't that what you said to me
last time?</i>

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.460
<i>Ajussi!</i>
