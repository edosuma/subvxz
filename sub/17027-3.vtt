00:01.369 --> 00:05.373
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.476
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.045
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:11.079 --> 00:12.513
and by the time I got here,

00:12.546 --> 00:17.118
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.687
I hid who I really was
until one day,

00:19.720 --> 00:23.091
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.460
To most people
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.494 --> 00:30.264
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:30.298 --> 00:31.765
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.799 --> 00:34.468
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.239
I am Supergirl.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.842
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.875 --> 00:44.812
LENA: When Superman put Lex
in jail, I vowed to take back
my family's company.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.280
Make it a force for good.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.583
I am taking a leave of absence
from Catco.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.119
I am the new Cat.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.154
Snapper Carr,
meet Kara Danvers.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.557
Snapper will be running
the investigative team
at Catco Magazine.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.693
SUPERGIRL:
He landed on Earth last night
in a Kryptonian pod.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.262
We don't know who he is.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.564
So when you wake up,
I'll be here for you.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.366
(GASPS)

01:11.139 --> 01:12.640
(GRUNTS)

01:13.574 --> 01:15.443
(ALARM BLARING)

01:22.583 --> 01:23.684
Hold it right there!

01:28.889 --> 01:30.224
Don't move!

01:35.763 --> 01:37.498
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

01:41.569 --> 01:42.570
Freeze!

01:57.918 --> 02:01.755
HANK HENSHAW: I sure picked
the wrong time to get rid of
all my Kryptonite.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.524
You all right?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.626
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
just a little shaken.
Where is he?

02:05.659 --> 02:08.496
-He disappeared into the city.
-Which is just
what I don't need.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.599
A rogue Kryptonian on the
loose just as the President
is due for a visit.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.501
Wait, the President
is coming here?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.903
Yeah, she wants to tour
the DEO while she's
in National City

02:15.936 --> 02:17.738
to sign the Alien Amnesty Act.

02:17.771 --> 02:21.475
It's amazing,
an executive order
allowing aliens on Earth

02:21.509 --> 02:25.746
to come out of the shadows
and live as full citizens.
She's making history.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.882
Not in my book,
I think she's making
a big mistake.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.284
Now, how can you
of all people say that?

02:30.318 --> 02:33.587
Because it's been my hard
experience that humans
and aliens don't mix.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.257
-What about you and me?
-What about us?

02:36.290 --> 02:39.593
We can look like them,
we blend in,
a lot of aliens can't.

02:39.627 --> 02:44.332
And people in this world
don't have much tolerance
for others who look different.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.699
I say that as an alien
and as someone

02:45.733 --> 02:48.236
who's worn the face of
a black man for 15 years.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.803
J'onn's right.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.939
I can count the number
of good aliens I know
on one hand,

02:51.972 --> 02:53.941
with two fingers to spare.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.976
Well, I'm just glad
the President doesn't see
things the way you two do.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.280
-Well, you be sure to tell
her that when you meet her.
-What?

02:59.313 --> 03:04.385
She expects National City's
highest-profile alien
to greet her on the tarmac.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.986
I'm meeting the President?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.289
Unless you're too
nervous to do so.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.424
Nervous? No.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.625
Me?

03:11.659 --> 03:13.561
I'm not...
No, I'm not nervous.

03:13.594 --> 03:17.331
No, it's... Nervous?
Yeah, yes, yeah,
I'm really nervous.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.300
I'm nervous!
It's the President.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.336
You'll be representing
this entire organization.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.771
I expect you'll
be professional.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.806
Yes.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.576
And for the record,
she's the one who's
lucky to meet you.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.845
Thanks.
Should I get a blow out?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.247
Oh, dear God.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.649
What?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.420
Welcome, guys,

03:39.453 --> 03:41.855
to an editorial meeting
for the history books.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.358
I truly believe,
one day we'll stand
in front of our kids

03:44.392 --> 03:48.796
and tell them where we were
when the President stood up
for all individuals' rights.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.832
Regardless of birth planet.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.902
So, we need a banner headline.
Thoughts?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.904
We're going to stand here
and pitch headlines?

03:56.937 --> 03:58.772
Well, that's kind of
how it goes around here,
Snapper.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.275
You don't come up with
a headline first, Olsen.

04:01.309 --> 04:05.513
You go on the street first,
find the news peg.
The headline comes second.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.415
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, Cat Grant...

04:07.448 --> 04:08.849
SNAPPER:
Puff princess did it this way.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.884
Put the cart before the horse.
You said that already.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.021
Are you gonna be
a pale carbon copy
of your former boss

04:14.054 --> 04:16.490
or are you gonna be
a hard news man?

04:16.524 --> 04:17.691
Make your own mark.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.763
Okay, um...

04:22.796 --> 04:25.833
Let's take a pause
on the headline then.

04:25.866 --> 04:30.404
Our first priority is to
get an exclusive with
the President.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.540
Everything else today
is icing.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.508
SNAPPER: I say everything
else is bread and butter.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.077
Scope, call the AFL
for a response to the bill.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.881
Do the unions fear legal
aliens are gonna flood the
labor market, lower wages?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.917
How does the American worker
feel about competing for jobs
with aliens?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.086
-JAMES: Fine, great.
So next meeting...
-Addison, on the CDC.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.623
What bacteria and diseases
are these aliens bringing
from other planets?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.559
What medical protocols
are in place?

04:51.592 --> 04:54.528
Morris, you do the
human-interest piece.
"Inter-planetary marriage."

04:54.562 --> 04:57.798
Get quotes from priests,
rabbis, Mormons, Unitarians.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.000
-As for the POTUS
interview...
-Danvers is on that.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.803
Danvers is a rookie.
We need someone hard-hitting.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.838
Believe me,
she's hard-hitting.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.908
Trust me, I can pack a punch
like you would not believe.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.011
Plus I may or may not
be running into
the President later.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.682
Parker, you get POTUS.
Danvers, you get Lena Luthor.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.685
Her brother is infamous
for his anti-alien sentiments.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
The desk needs all your
copy by noon,

05:19.720 --> 05:22.490
and if you want to keep
your credentials,
it better be clean.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.561
(EXHALES)

05:27.595 --> 05:28.829
Ah, sorry. I got to go.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.931
Supergirl is meeting
the President.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.466
No biggie.

05:42.743 --> 05:46.514
-It's pretty awesome, right?
-Do you know her?

05:46.547 --> 05:49.450
No, no, not yet, but...

05:49.483 --> 05:53.421
I'm pretty sure we'll be cool.
You know? Right?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.823
(CROWD CHEERING)

06:01.929 --> 06:03.831
(CROWD CHEERING)

06:16.677 --> 06:18.546
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.
-Go!

06:36.630 --> 06:37.931
SUPERGIRL: Watch out!

06:56.216 --> 06:57.651
So, where's the President now?

06:57.685 --> 06:59.620
They're taking her back
to the DEO.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.522
She was... She was so nice.

07:01.555 --> 07:05.593
And grateful,
and she called me Supergirl.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.661
-That is your name.
-Yeah, I know that but...

07:07.695 --> 07:10.430
When she says it,
it just sounds better.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.000
"Supergirl."

07:13.033 --> 07:14.802
How did anyone even
vote for that other guy?

07:14.835 --> 07:17.738
When you're done fawning over
your new best friend...

07:17.771 --> 07:21.108
The burn pattern
is consistent with
a heat-vision signature.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.477
Our escaped Kryptonian's
been awake six hours

07:23.511 --> 07:25.913
and the first thing he does
is try and kill the President?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.748
Winn's working
on tracking him.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.584
In the meantime,
let's gather whatever
evidence we can find.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.026
Hey! What the hell do you
think you're doing
in my crime scene?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.562
Anyone ever tell you,
all you Feds sound the same?

07:41.595 --> 07:44.665
It's like you all watch
the same bad movies
together at Quantico.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.133
Who are you?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.836
Detective Maggie Sawyer,
NCPD Science Division.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.940
We handle all cases
involving aliens and things
that go bump in the night.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.975
Showed you mine.
Show me yours?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.982
Alex Danvers, Secret Service.

08:02.015 --> 08:06.119
I'm sure you mean well,
detective, but this is
a federal crime scene.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.056
-You're contaminating
my evidence.
-I'm contaminating it?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.725
Your lackey over there
is bagging charred carpet
and crispy limo

08:11.759 --> 08:13.627
into the same Ziploc.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.863
I thought the Secret Service
would pay closer attention
to detail.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.132
We have technology
that makes your City PD lab
look like an Easy-Bake Oven.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.270
And us dumb local cops
would never deduce that
the President's assailant

08:23.303 --> 08:26.674
was either Kryptonian
or Infernian.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.743
-Both species
have heat vision.
-Thank you.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.079
-We'll take it from here.
-The airport is within
my jurisdiction.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.716
Your jurisdiction ends
where I say it does.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.053
See you around, Danvers.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.963
Make sure you're bagging
that up properly.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.735
HANK HENSHAW:
Welcome to the DEO,
Madam President.

08:54.768 --> 08:58.071
I'm surprised,
now that your true identity
is known to the world,

08:58.105 --> 09:01.241
you don't live openly
as your Martian self.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.177
I find looking human makes
people feel more comfortable.

09:04.211 --> 09:08.582
Hopefully,
my Alien Amnesty Act
will change that.

09:08.616 --> 09:14.154
For you and everyone else
from beyond the stars that
have made Earth their home.

09:14.187 --> 09:19.092
I know the DEO's mission
is to hunt renegade aliens,

09:19.126 --> 09:22.129
but that mission is going
to have to adapt.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.198
-You disagree, Director?
-I do, Madam President.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.802
There are aliens out there,
killers who wouldn't
understand the concept

09:28.836 --> 09:30.804
of the very rights
you're offering them.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.073
Evil creatures
who could take advantage
of your good will.

09:33.106 --> 09:39.312
I imagine the very same
thing was once said about you,
J'onn J'onzz

09:39.346 --> 09:42.115
but someone gave you the
benefit of the doubt.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.885
Isn't it time we paid
that forward?

09:44.918 --> 09:48.021
I can think of no better time
than the present

09:48.055 --> 09:50.257
to extend our hand
in friendship.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.859
Even if that hand
might get bitten off?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.795
-One has to have hope.
-What if it's false hope?

09:54.828 --> 09:59.132
It's hope, J'onn.
How can it be false?

10:01.401 --> 10:03.937
SUPERGIRL: Did you hear that?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.806
That was, like, a legit quote.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.274
People are going to quote her.

10:09.376 --> 10:13.981
Okay, well, I have to go.
I'm conducting my very first
interview as a reporter.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.150
Just call me if she says
anything else cool, okay?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.822
What do you think?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.824
I think hope
isn't going to catch
our would-be assassin.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.030
-KARA: Ms. Luthor.
-Lena, please.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.699
It's good to see you
again, Ms. Danvers.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.201
-Well, if I'm
calling you Lena...
-Kara it is.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.704
Um, if you have
a parking ticket, I can
have it validated for you.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.906
Oh, no, no, no.
That's fine, I flew here.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.975
On... On a bus.

10:42.009 --> 10:46.313
Well, I'm glad to see
you decided to give
reporting a shot.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.282
Although if you're here
on the same day
the President is in town

10:49.316 --> 10:51.251
to sign her Alien Amnesty Act,
then...

10:51.284 --> 10:56.289
I must be here
to ask the sister of Earth's
most notorious alien-hater

10:56.323 --> 10:59.026
her take on the President's
executive order.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.828
I want to show you something.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.364
(BEEPS)

11:08.802 --> 11:10.037
What is it?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.239
It's an alien detection device
that allows humans to find out

11:12.272 --> 11:14.808
who among them is not truly
one of them.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.176
It's not market-ready yet.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.845
I mean, we're still
developing the prototype.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.246
But we aim to have this device

11:19.279 --> 11:22.015
in every store, in every
town all across America.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.752
-How does it work?
-It's just a simple skin test.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.054
Okay, let me show you
what a negative response
looks like.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.057
-(BEEPING)
-See.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.258
Right?

11:31.291 --> 11:32.860
Now, you try.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.464
But won't a device
like this...

11:39.032 --> 11:41.168
Doesn't it go
against everything

11:41.201 --> 11:43.236
America is supposed
to stand for?

11:44.471 --> 11:46.073
Such as?

11:46.106 --> 11:49.076
Well, freedom...
(CHUCKLES)

11:49.109 --> 11:51.912
...against persecution,
oppression.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.914
America's always been a
country full of immigrants.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.949
It's also always been
a country of humans.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.384
(LAUGHS) Just...

11:57.417 --> 12:00.954
Don't you think this device
will force aliens back

12:00.988 --> 12:04.091
into the very shadows
the President is trying
to shine a light on?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.760
If aliens want to be citizens,
that's now their right.

12:06.794 --> 12:10.397
But if humans wanna know
which of their fellow citizens
aren't actually one of them,

12:10.430 --> 12:13.133
then that's their right too.

L-Corp is in the business
of making money

12:16.269 --> 12:18.839

to make us a fortune.

-Where?

12:49.937 --> 12:53.240
Ah, looks like an abandoned

the Arts District.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.375
Hah, I mean it took some
doing, but

12:55.408 --> 13:00.113
I got the tracker on his
DEO-issued medical bracelet
back online

13:00.147 --> 13:04.284

the location and...
You are already gone.

''I should've
waited for you.''

14:24.697 --> 14:27.500
No, I was gonna say,
''You should have waited
for me, dummy.''

14:27.534 --> 14:30.237

been there?
What would you have done?

-Want to see how us local cops
deal with the aliens?

-You wanted to see me, boss?
-I have your article on
Lena Luthor.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.992
That was some scoop, huh?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.627
''Lena Luthor's stated goal
is to repair the damage

15:16.616 --> 15:19.452
I was really proud
of that sentence.

What the hell is this?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.960
It's... It's what you wanted.

You said you wanted
Lena Luthor's take on aliens.
Well, here it is.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.665
She thinks they should be
ID'd like lepers.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.534
I am not questioning
the scoop.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.504
What I'm questioning is the
the clear slant in your
reporting.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.174
If I wanted your opinion on
the news, I would have
assigned you to Op-Ed.

15:41.208 --> 15:45.412
So...
So, I shouldn't
report truthfully?

15:45.445 --> 15:49.682
There is a difference between
truthful reporting
and bias reporting.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.053
This is over-saturated with
your pro-alien slant.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.388
Facts Ms. Danvers. Who?
What? When? Where? Why?

15:55.422 --> 16:00.060
But nothing I wrote was
inaccurate. That device is
bad, objectively bad.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.095
That's up for the reader
to decide.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.632

keep your personal feelings
to yourself.

I'm sorry James.
-No, I get it, I miss her too,

16:20.380 --> 16:24.451
I mean Ms. Grant would've
never let that arrogant trash

16:24.484 --> 16:26.553
-hijack her meeting.
-No, no.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.123
She would've destroyed him
with one withering gaze, but
how did she even do that?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.759

James, she picked you.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.263

would've handed over her
entire company to someone

16:36.296 --> 16:38.631
she didn't truly believe in?

Don't be the boss Cat was,
be the boss you
want to be.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.173

18:27.407 --> 18:29.876
about the alien populace
in National City.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.878

18:40.387 --> 18:42.489

is she Roltikkon?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.591
Yes, she is.

making physical contact

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362

19:13.920 --> 19:15.922
Our alien neighbors,
they are no different.

19:15.955 --> 19:20.327
Most of them are hardworking
immigrants, or refugees just
trying to get by.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.697
They have to hide who they are
in order to survive.
I can sympathize with that.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.843
Yeah? Passion is great

scan the city for any

figure that out?

He must be trying
to contact Krypton.

He doesn't know
it was destroyed.

He did not dial Krypton.

going to then?

didn't get along.

Hundreds of years ago,
Krypton and Daxam fought a
bloody war to a stalemate.

22:30.783 --> 22:35.655
Thousands of lives were lost
on both sides because of
a pointless war Daxam started.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.127
A world of explorers,

22:41.160 --> 22:43.396
and Daxam, was a monarchy.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.599
With kings and queens
who ruled a
population of hoodlums.

on Krypton for Daxamites,
"May tex kolar Daxam."

feel about us.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.491
High-and-mighty,
"enlightened" Krypton.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.693
Looking down on us
lowly peasants

24:20.727 --> 24:23.162
ever since you attacked us
with no provocation.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.864
We attacked you? Is that...

24:28.935 --> 24:30.970
Why did you send
a broadcast to Daxam?

24:31.003 --> 24:34.140
-It was a distress call.
-Why were you sending
a distress call?

24:34.173 --> 24:35.875
Because I'm in distress!

24:35.908 --> 24:39.211
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, I'm not here by choice.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.847
I'm just letting
my people know I'm alive.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.650
Yeah, okay. So if you're
marooned on this planet,

24:43.683 --> 24:46.786
why are you trying
to kill the President?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.255
Sorry, what's a...
What's a pres... Presibent?

24:49.288 --> 24:52.725
If you thought I punched hard
before, wait till you see me
when I'm angry.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.594
I didn't come here
to kill anyone!

24:54.627 --> 24:56.629
Good, because you never will.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.134
Right, and you've already
made up your mind about me.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.673
So, it seems kind of pointless
to keep talking to you.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.910
Bye-bye, your highness.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.648
(SIGHS)
Oh, that's better.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.787
Oh, hey, I could really use
that Zakkarian ale though.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.156
Just give a think on it.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.930
-You didn't tell him
what happened to Daxam?
-No, I didn't.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.737
KARA: Thank you.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.839
Hi, I'm sorry to
drop in unannounced,

25:39.872 --> 25:41.708
I just got the message
you wanted to see me.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.042
Those flowers are beautiful.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.244
They're called plumerias.
They're pretty rare.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.312
They remind me of my mother.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.780
Was your mother a writer, too?

25:47.814 --> 25:51.183
No, she was, um,
I guess, sort of a lawyer.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.786
Well, you've have a
natural gift with words.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.788
-The article's amazing.
-(LAUGHS)

25:55.822 --> 25:57.657
Yeah, I knew you'd make a
great reporter,

25:57.690 --> 26:01.327
but after I heard your
bleeding heart,
pro-alien views,

26:01.360 --> 26:03.830
I was afraid you'd do
a hatchet job on me.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.364
Oh, I tried.

26:05.397 --> 26:09.035
I tried,
I wrote a scathing article
about your device.

26:09.702 --> 26:10.903
-And?
-And...

26:10.937 --> 26:12.872
My boss tossed it.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.340
He made me re-do it.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.942
Well, that explains it.
(CHUCKLES)

26:15.975 --> 26:18.077
The funny thing is,
I'm glad he did.

26:18.110 --> 26:23.650
I mean, not at first, but
some things happened that
made me re-think my position.

26:23.683 --> 26:24.984
-Do tell.
-(LAUGHS)

26:27.186 --> 26:30.890
I still think Alien Amnesty
is a good thing,

26:30.923 --> 26:34.126
but, there are bad aliens
out there...

26:34.160 --> 26:37.830
Well, I'm glad you can see
from my point of view.

26:37.864 --> 26:43.069
You know, when I was first
adopted by the Luthors,
I adored Lex.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.971
When he showed
his true colors,
I was crushed.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.274
I tried everything
to reach him, bring him back
to the side of good.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.877
But it was no use.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.112
I'd lost him.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.648
Finally, I realized that
some people are just bad.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.017
And there is nothing
you can do to change that.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.887
But, you can learn
to protect yourself.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.389
Yeah.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.791
(SOFTLY CHUCKLES)

Does it all look okay?

27:15.702 --> 27:17.704
All clear.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.007
With our wayward Daxamite
locked up, I don't think
we'll have any problems.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.076
The President must be relieved
you got the alien
trying to kill her.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.145
Thank you again
for all your help.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.981

Some black site
he'll never return from?

Over a century ago,
this nation erected a monument
in New York Harbor.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.367
A Statue of Liberty.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.938
That Statue looked down upon
Ellis Island,

27:51.971 --> 27:55.407
where thousands of immigrants
came to seek refuge,

27:55.441 --> 27:59.979
from a home country
that didn't want them,
that wouldn't have them.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.848
But America took them in.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.184
That is our story.

-So the attacker was not our

-No.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.976
No, this is all my fault.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.878
And now
Detective Sawyer is missing.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.012
You can't blame yourself.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.446
We all missed it.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.983
But if I hadn't been so
blinded by how
I felt about Daxam,

30:17.016 --> 30:19.418
we could have been out there
searching for
the real assassin.

30:19.451 --> 30:23.489

and the President almost died
as a result.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.336
Thought I was
a dangerous killer.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.438
I don't know you at all.

37:19.471 --> 37:23.642
And it was a mistake of me to
misjudge you just
because you're from Daxam.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.646
SUPERGIRL: You didn't try
to kill the President.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.449
I apologize for
assuming you did.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.423
My name is Kara Zor-El,
I'm from Krypton.

37:37.456 --> 37:42.728
(INHALES DEEPLY)
And like you, I'm a refugee
on this planet.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.796
Earth.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.338
My name is Mon-El.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.877
So, uh, what now?

37:58.910 --> 38:01.380
Can you help me get in touch
with my home world?

38:04.015 --> 38:05.384
Uh.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.620
You might want to sit down.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.955
There's something
I have to tell you.

38:14.826 --> 38:20.432
When Krypton was destroyed,
the debris showered
onto Daxam.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.969
Yeah, I know, that's...
That's why I got out of there
in a hurry.

38:24.002 --> 38:28.707
Some of the larger masses
struck Daxam's moon,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.877
disrupting the
gravitational force
of the planet.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.715
Wait, what are you...
What are you saying?

38:37.516 --> 38:38.717
(SIGHS) Uh.

38:39.985 --> 38:44.490
Daxam is still there,
but it was ravaged
by solar storms.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.861
It's a wasteland now.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.865
Your home...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.602
My home...

38:58.437 --> 38:59.705
They're, uh...

39:01.106 --> 39:02.608
They're gone.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.915
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

39:09.948 --> 39:12.884
And a very personal
thank you to both of you.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.387
(LAUGHS)
It was an honor,
Madam President.

39:15.421 --> 39:19.124
It was nothing. And I still
can't believe I got to see
Air Force One.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.460
If you think that's cool,

39:21.493 --> 39:24.029
you ought to see my other jet.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.032
HANK HENSHAW:
Madam President, I am
still wary of your policy.

39:29.635 --> 39:34.773
It's not enough to
defend the world, J'onn.
You need to live in it too.

39:42.548 --> 39:46.852
KARA: (SIGHS)
Could she be any cooler?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.454
HANK HENSHAW:
I suppose not.

(CAN WHIZZING)

40:36.802 --> 40:38.537
Sorry. What can I get...

40:43.609 --> 40:45.644
I can transform,
if that's...

40:45.677 --> 40:47.879
No, I'm sorry, it's just...

40:49.615 --> 40:51.950
Do I know you?

40:51.983 --> 40:53.985
No. And my shift ended
10 minutes ago.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.987
Darla, over there,
will get you started.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.735
Hey!

41:11.202 --> 41:12.571
Who are you?

41:14.906 --> 41:15.907
(SIGHS)

41:26.885 --> 41:29.054
My name is M'gann M'orzz.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.056
I am the last daughter
of Mars.
