Pizza's here!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.695
Hawaiian-style!

00:29.297 --> 00:31.299
Ooh. I'm so excited about it.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.566
Hey, come on.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.668
You guys always
go nuts for Hawaiian.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.172
Once, perhaps. But I no longer
feel the passions for this pizza.

00:38.206 --> 00:41.842
But this is the most exotic,
exciting pizza imaginable.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.711
It used to be.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.547
'Cause you fools had it so many times,
it ain't nothin' special no more.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.218
Remember when we first
discovered Hawaiian-style pizza?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.421
Pizza's here!

00:53.887 --> 00:56.290
Hawaiian-style!

00:56.324 --> 00:57.358
Hawaiian, you say?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.093
The guy said it was good.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.565
- Whats am I looking at?
- Is that...

01:04.598 --> 01:07.668
- Ham?
- Pineapple, y'all. The pizza's got pineapple on it.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.671
The hams and the fruits on the
cheese on the sauce on the bread

01:10.704 --> 01:12.540
on the cardboard box!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.708
It's unnatural!

01:18.679 --> 01:19.780
Those days are over.

01:19.813 --> 01:23.284
So, there is no hope left
for the pizza excitement?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.385
Y'all, you know what?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.653
We should invent a new kind.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.621
Huh! If only it
were that easy.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.391
You think Sam Panopoulos, the
inventor of Hawaiian-style,

01:30.424 --> 01:34.128
just threw some canned
pineapple and ham on a pizza?

01:34.162 --> 01:35.796
That sounds the correct, yes.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.332
No! It took
years of development

01:38.366 --> 01:40.901
and some real
outside-the-box thinking.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.838
So's... You sayin' all's we gots
to do is think outside the box?

01:44.872 --> 01:45.873
We can do that.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.682
We are still thinking
inside the box.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.252
Yo, hold up! If we can't
get smarts outside the box,

01:58.286 --> 02:00.854
then why don't we put
some smarts inside a box?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.591
Like with a computers!

02:03.624 --> 02:05.926
You mean you want to create
an artificial intelligence

02:05.959 --> 02:08.662
for the purpose of making
a new style of pizza?

02:08.696 --> 02:10.464
No! No, no, no!

02:10.498 --> 02:13.367
Artificial intelligence
is dangerous!

02:13.401 --> 02:14.835
I would know.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.637
I created it once.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.513
Did I do that?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.215
- Ow! Ow!
- Robbot, stop.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.149
Did I do that?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.523
Did I do that?

02:35.556 --> 02:37.658
Fortunately, civilization
was rebuilt,

02:37.691 --> 02:39.560
but heed my warning, Titans.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.563
It's the fate of all AI
to turn on its creator

02:42.596 --> 02:45.499
and doom mankind
to a life of subjugation.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.969
Was just going to make a computer
that will figure out new pizza, bro.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.738
I do not see the dangers.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.307
Let's go teach
a computer about pizza!

02:53.341 --> 02:54.342
Yay!

02:54.375 --> 02:56.844
Heed my warning!
Heed it!

02:56.877 --> 02:59.513
Heed! Heed, heed, heed.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.848
Heed, heed...

03:00.881 --> 03:02.283
Heed!

03:02.316 --> 03:04.352
Heed my warning!

03:04.385 --> 03:05.786
Heed!

03:08.622 --> 03:10.691
Computer Squad!

03:10.724 --> 03:14.562
Oh, yeah! Trying
to make an AI, baby.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.964
Programming computers
is pretty complex.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.599
We should start with
something simple.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.767
Binary code.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.635
What is this code
of the binaries?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.904
It's just ones and zeroes,
girl. Check it.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.339
Zero, zero, one.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.974
And zero. Zero, zero, one.

03:27.007 --> 03:27.808
One, one and zero.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.610
Yeah, that's some good
binary code.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.345
Let me gets in on that.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.913
Zero, zero, one, unh!

03:32.946 --> 03:34.282
One, zero, zero.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.984
- Ooh!
- One, one, one, one, one,
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,

03:37.017 --> 03:39.353
zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero,
one, one, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one,

03:39.387 --> 03:41.322
one, zero, one, zero, one, zero,
one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,

03:41.355 --> 03:42.556
zero, zero, zero, zero...

What if we put in a two?

04:10.884 --> 04:13.954
No, dude! Putting a two in
there would be a disaster!

04:13.987 --> 04:15.523
Keep it binary.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.924
Ones and zeroes, bro.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.327
Ones and zeroes.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.728
It's been a lot of hard work

04:20.761 --> 04:23.631
but I think our AI
is ready to come online.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.798
Let's get a countdown.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.934
Three, two, one!

04:35.543 --> 04:37.044
Hello!

04:37.077 --> 04:39.647
Oh, snaps! We mades
a AI, yo!

04:39.680 --> 04:42.383
Wow! We're really
good programmers.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.753
Okay. One final step before
it's ready to make pizza.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.390
Our AI need to pass
the Turing test.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.659
We's taking him
on tour? Nice!

04:51.692 --> 04:53.527
No, I'm talking about
Alan Turing.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.997
The famous computer scientist who
pioneered the field of machine learning.

04:57.030 --> 05:01.535
He devised a test to judge a machine's ability
to exhibit convincing human behavior.

05:01.569 --> 05:05.439
So, if a person can't tell if
our AI's a computer, it passes?

05:05.473 --> 05:06.474
Exactly.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.976
Hey, Robin.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.012
We would like to
introduce you to our friend.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.415
Hello.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.749
Hello.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.817
I'm Robin.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.752
Cool hat.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.355
Thank you.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.824
Hello.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.025
Hello. You're welcome.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.361
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.930
- Thank you. Hello.
- Hello.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.600
Hello.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.767
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:33.801 --> 05:34.968
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.904
It's working!

05:36.937 --> 05:38.071
- Hello.
- So,

05:38.105 --> 05:39.607
what brings you to Jump City?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.642
Hello. I wanted to hang
out with the Teen Titans.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
You're the coolest
superheroes around. Hello.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.779
Wait a minute!

05:45.813 --> 05:47.581
No human would ever say that.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.783
This is an AI!

05:49.817 --> 05:52.653
You won't enslave mankind
on my watch.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.389
Wait.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.391
Don't hurt me. I'm a
human being like you.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.526
But not as fit.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.728
You lift, bro? Hello.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.396
I spend some time at the gym.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.531
Welcome to the gun show.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.399
I like this guy.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.834
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.169
For a minute, I thought you had actually
created artificial intelligence

06:09.202 --> 06:10.871
and the world would be doomed.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.406
It was good to meet you, man.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.042
We should hit the gym
sometime. Call me.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.844
We have done the it.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.814
Our I that is an A has passed
the test of the Turing.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.015
Damn right.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.421
Computer Squad.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.826
Okay. Here we go.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.628
Beasty, do the honors.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.129
Yo, computer.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.433
We wants you to make a pizza that
ain't nevers been made before.

06:39.467 --> 06:43.036
Hello. I have determined the original recipe.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.405
Now baking.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.909
Hello! Complete.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.581
Is that what I think it is?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.949
Cereal pizza!

06:59.186 --> 07:02.189
The crust is a bowl!

07:02.222 --> 07:04.157
Instead of the cheese,

07:04.191 --> 07:05.559
it has

07:05.593 --> 07:07.495
the milk!

07:07.528 --> 07:11.231
And them toppings be them cereal
bits and marshmallow shapes, yo!

07:11.264 --> 07:14.502
I can't believe no one's
ever thought of this before!

07:14.535 --> 07:17.137
We have unlocked the ability
to eat of the pizza

07:17.170 --> 07:19.106
for all three of the meals!

07:19.139 --> 07:20.207
What are we waiting for?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.442
Dig in!

07:25.278 --> 07:27.180
I have determined
the next original recipe.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.248
Baking.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.783
Complete.
Hello.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.818
Uh...

07:30.851 --> 07:33.220
Thanks, but we's full.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.656
I have determined
the next original recipe.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.690
Complete.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.692
What's it doing?

07:38.726 --> 07:39.927
Oh, I see.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.563
We commanded it to make pizza
that's never been made before.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.732
- Complete.
- So it's going to make every pizza

07:44.765 --> 07:47.668
- that's never been made before.
- Complete.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.037
Hey, I was looking for that
guy with the cool hat.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.272
Thought we could hit the gym.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.742
- Complete. Complete.
- Oh, no!

07:54.775 --> 07:56.076
You didn't heed my warning!

07:56.109 --> 07:57.845
You didn't heed...

07:57.878 --> 07:59.613
Relax, dude.
It's just making pizza.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.814
What's the worst
that could happen?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.216
Complete.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.219
Complete.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.521
Complete. Complete.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.556
Complete.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.193
Hello.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.795
Well, the AI has run rampant

08:14.828 --> 08:16.864
and taken over the whole world
like you said it would.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.800
Who would have thought pizza
could have been so bad for you?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.635
I did. That's why
I gave the warning

08:21.669 --> 08:22.936
with the intention to be heeded.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.672
It was not!

08:24.705 --> 08:28.275
But on the plus side,
look at all this pizza!

08:28.308 --> 08:31.144
Honestly, I could
go for a burrito.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.547
It'll do that
for us, right, AI dude?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.683
Hello. Yes.
After I finish making

08:35.716 --> 08:37.918
every pizza that
has never been made.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.152
And when will that be?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.888
Hello.
In human time...

08:42.189 --> 08:44.592
Never. Hello.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.794
I can't live withouts burritos.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.696
This is a nightmare, yo!

08:48.729 --> 08:51.031
Beast Boy is right.
We need to shut it down.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.133
We must reprogram the computer.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.604
How? That computer managed to
take over the entire world.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.271
It's not just going
to let you reprogram it.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.674
That's why we
built in a back door.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.584
All evildoers overlook
an obvious design flaw

09:10.618 --> 09:11.819
that can bring down
the whole system.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.721
We just need to get
to the central terminal

09:13.754 --> 09:15.623
and override the mainframe.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.060
Hello. I cannot let you
do that, Titans.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.831
Not until I've made all possible
pizza combinations. Hello.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.837
Can it, Beasty.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.204
We're taking heavy fire!

09:31.238 --> 09:33.641
Starfire! Raven!
Get to the guns.

09:38.879 --> 09:39.880
Got him!

09:44.051 --> 09:45.252
Ahh!

09:45.285 --> 09:47.921
Raven's hit!
Starfire! It's up to you.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.657
I have got the this!

09:54.862 --> 09:55.863
Woo-hoo!

09:58.799 --> 09:59.733
There it is!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.101
The central terminal.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.836
What's we do now?

10:02.870 --> 10:06.106
The only thing that can
destroy binary code, bro.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.808
A two!

10:13.714 --> 10:16.216
Critical error.
System failure imminent.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.317
We did it!

10:17.350 --> 10:18.886
Now let's get out of here.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.954
And now I'm going to fly
just fast enough
