02:09.506 --> 02:11.007
Mind if I do a quick mop?

02:11.174 --> 02:12.509
You're shouting.

02:12.675 --> 02:13.676
What?

02:17.847 --> 02:19.682
- I can come back later.
- No, it's fine.

02:20.517 --> 02:22.101
Just don't touch anything.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.897
"Just don't touch anything."

02:25.980 --> 02:27.023
Dickbreath.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.860
You want a Tic Tac?

02:32.946 --> 02:35.281
All right. I'll take that as a no.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.382
Oh. Come on.

03:18.783 --> 03:19.784
Oh...

03:21.327 --> 03:24.247
What the hell happened to you, dude?

03:32.755 --> 03:35.675
Dod? What the fuck
kind of name is Dod?

03:36.551 --> 03:38.595
Oh!

03:43.683 --> 03:45.852
Go, go, go, go, go.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.022
Come on!

03:53.610 --> 03:56.029
No! Oh, no, no, no. Reset, reset.

03:56.613 --> 03:58.615
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.617
Dod! Come on!

04:01.951 --> 04:04.704
Clear! Accept! Accept the motherfucker!

04:05.288 --> 04:07.040
Shit. Okay. All right.

04:07.457 --> 04:08.458
Um...

04:09.459 --> 04:11.461
I'll do CPR. Yeah.

04:20.345 --> 04:23.681
All right! Some Takis Fuego.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.728
Come on!

04:30.813 --> 04:32.815
Come on, breathe, dude!

04:37.362 --> 04:39.697
Oh, shit! Oh, hell, no.

04:41.366 --> 04:43.409
Okay. All right. All right. Come on, Dod.

04:43.493 --> 04:44.786
Come on. We got this.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.337
Please, come on, Dod!

04:55.004 --> 04:56.005
One, one thousand!

04:56.339 --> 04:57.382
Two, one thousand!

04:58.466 --> 04:59.467
Ah!

05:20.697 --> 05:21.698
No, no, no!

05:22.907 --> 05:24.200
No, no, no!

05:27.370 --> 05:28.371
Come on.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.583
Ah!

05:52.061 --> 05:54.063
You are kidding me.

06:05.742 --> 06:07.243
Oh, crap.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.093
Why?

06:53.790 --> 06:55.390
<i>You know
what's cooler than cool?</i>

06:55.625 --> 06:56.959
<i>Scouting!</i>

06:57.126 --> 06:58.127
Action!

06:58.294 --> 07:00.880
Hi, there, guys.
My name is Scout Leader Rogers.

07:01.130 --> 07:05.051
And I'm here to show you
what scouting is all about. Come...

07:05.301 --> 07:08.304
<i>Being a Scout is about
the bonds of friendship.</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
<i>Check it out!</i>

07:11.682 --> 07:15.686
<i>These Scouts are on their way
to earning a Bow and Arrow Badge!</i>

07:16.395 --> 07:20.149
<i>Badges are the Scouts'
highest symbol of achievement.</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:23.986
<i>Scouts can earn all sorts of badges.</i>

07:25.822 --> 07:27.990
<i>What's cooler than cool?</i>

07:28.324 --> 07:29.992
<i>Scouting!</i>

07:32.495 --> 07:36.833
All right, are you in or are you in?

07:43.840 --> 07:45.680
Hey, listen, there's free
cookies every Friday.

07:45.842 --> 07:48.344
We do sing-alongs on Saturdays.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.346
It looks great on a college application!

07:51.681 --> 07:53.933
I love this tragic ritual.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.269
Someone's gonna sign up, guys!

07:56.352 --> 07:57.520
We have to keep trying!

07:57.854 --> 08:00.148
Augie, a unicorn's
gonna fly out of your ass

08:00.231 --> 08:01.524
before somebody joins.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.442
Carter! Language.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.902
Yeah, he's right.
Nobody's ever gonna sign up.

08:04.986 --> 08:06.279
It's just a waste of time.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.906
Ye of little faith.
Where's that Scout spirit?

08:09.365 --> 08:11.492
Look, guys, we're not gonna
quit trying just because

08:11.576 --> 08:13.661
we lost a couple hours
sitting around on our butts

08:13.744 --> 08:14.954
with nothing to show for it.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.582
I mean, some people
spend their entire lives

08:17.665 --> 08:19.792
and have nothing to show for it.

08:22.587 --> 08:23.796
Well...

08:24.005 --> 08:26.424
I think we all know
it's Augie's special night.

08:29.302 --> 08:31.846
After years of hard work and dedication,

08:31.929 --> 08:35.140
he will receive the highest
honor of a Scout,

08:35.224 --> 08:36.558
the Condor Badge,

08:36.893 --> 08:38.895
in a ceremony at tonight's campout.

08:39.020 --> 08:41.063
Okay. Let's see.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.815
Latrine duty: Carter.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.692
No! No, no, no, no.
I always dig the shitter.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.255
It's called a latrine, not a shitter.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.696
All right, Ben, you're on wiener duty.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.907
That's enough.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.826
Carter, nobody eats a hot dog like this.

08:55.745 --> 08:58.581
All right. Ben, why don't you
lead us in the Scout Oath?

08:58.998 --> 09:00.541
- Come on.
- All right.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.837
This do I swear:

09:05.254 --> 09:07.590
To live courageously,

09:07.673 --> 09:09.550
to help others when I can,

09:09.634 --> 09:13.346
defend what I must, so help me God.

09:13.429 --> 09:14.931
Scouts forever!

09:15.014 --> 09:16.349
Scouts forever!

09:16.599 --> 09:18.100
Scouts forever.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.186
Scouts forever.

09:20.353 --> 09:21.854
Forever!

09:26.442 --> 09:28.069
Ben, we have to tell Augie.

09:28.152 --> 09:29.528
- I know. I know.
- We're ditching Scouts.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.655
Yeah, we'll tell him.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.864
We've been talking
about it for over a year.

09:31.948 --> 09:33.699
I know.
We just have to find the right time.

09:33.783 --> 09:35.284
Okay, we'll do it tonight, then.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.286
No, we can't tell him tonight.
He's getting his Condor Badge.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.206
He's been working toward this
ever since he joined Scouts.

09:40.373 --> 09:41.958
You know how much it means to him.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.877
Especially since his dad can't be there.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.755
It's been two years, Ben.

09:47.838 --> 09:51.300
We can't just stay in Scouts
because we feel sorry for him.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.261
Come on, that's not the only
reason we're staying in Scouts.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.387
Come on, you've had fun.

09:54.470 --> 09:57.265
Had fun, okay? Past tense. Had.

09:57.348 --> 10:00.142
And now I am ready to move on.
I mean, you realize

10:00.226 --> 10:02.061
it's gonna be junior year next year.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.105
I mean, you know
what that means, right?

10:04.188 --> 10:05.564
We start thinking about college.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.567
We start thinking about pussy, Ben!

10:08.651 --> 10:11.404
Come on. Junior year is when
all the girls become sluts.

10:11.487 --> 10:12.488
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.491
And if we're sitting here
in these Scout uniforms,

10:15.574 --> 10:17.827
it's gonna be
the male version of a chastity belt, Ben.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.834
Oh, shit. Shit.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.211
What the fuck was that?

10:27.837 --> 10:29.922
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

10:35.261 --> 10:36.262
Oh, shit.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.306
Dude, that scared the shit out of me.

10:38.389 --> 10:39.932
Yeah, me, too.

10:40.016 --> 10:42.018
No, like, literally,
a little shit came out.

10:42.101 --> 10:43.436
Dude, stop.

10:46.856 --> 10:48.858
Jesus Christ. You hood-fucked Bambi.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.776
I didn't mean to!
It wasn't my fault, Carter!

10:50.860 --> 10:52.361
It was just standing there!

11:04.540 --> 11:06.042
Oh, shit.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.877
Oh. Damn it.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.629
Great. Just awesome.

11:11.881 --> 11:14.133
Is that a spare for your bike or the car?

11:14.216 --> 11:17.053
Shit. My dad's gonna be so pissed.

11:18.054 --> 11:19.388
Carter, where are the other lug nuts?

11:19.472 --> 11:21.307
How should I know?
I've been sitting here doing nothing.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.725
Yeah. I noticed.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.146
Oh. Dude, that's my sister.

11:28.064 --> 11:29.648
Kendall! Kendall!

11:30.816 --> 11:31.984
Hey!

11:35.112 --> 11:36.113
Hey.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.657
Can you help us?

11:56.884 --> 11:57.885
- Catch!
- Ow!

11:58.260 --> 11:59.345
- Jeff!
- What?

11:59.428 --> 12:00.513
I said, "Catch."

12:00.596 --> 12:02.014
I thought he had it.

12:02.098 --> 12:04.350
- Sorry, bro. It's my bad.
- Yeah.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.602
Are you guys okay?
I mean, what happened?

12:06.685 --> 12:09.355
We hit a white-tailed deer. It was huge.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.273
Yeah. We were just driving,
and then it was like, boom!

12:11.357 --> 12:13.692
You guys hit a deer? That's awesome.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.112
Nope, not awesome. Are you kidding?

12:16.195 --> 12:17.947
Nothing awesome about it.
Look at my car.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.368
What's up, Chloe?

12:23.285 --> 12:24.870
- Hey...
- Hey.

12:24.954 --> 12:26.539
- Carter.
- Carter!

12:26.622 --> 12:29.208
Yeah. I sit behind you in Spanish class.

12:31.252 --> 12:32.253
Oh, <i>gracias.</i>

12:33.045 --> 12:34.964
So, I'm really down with this

12:35.089 --> 12:36.549
whole little Scout uniform
you guys got going.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.842
All these little patches and stuff.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.594
Actually, Ben and Carter have been

12:40.678 --> 12:42.972
Scouts together since, what,
you were like six, right?

12:43.055 --> 12:45.349
- Yeah, yeah. A long time.
- That's awesome, man.

12:45.433 --> 12:47.059
Ben's like my little brother.

12:47.143 --> 12:48.978
Yep. That's me. Little brother Ben.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.396
Hey, Jeff!

12:51.313 --> 12:53.073
All right, well.
Sorry about that face again.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.820
Hey, are you going to the party tonight?

12:57.903 --> 12:58.904
What's up?

12:58.988 --> 13:02.825
Yo! Aber-blow-me and Bitch, man.
What's up? Hey.

13:02.908 --> 13:03.993
Always coming up with good ones.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.412
Listen, I was just talking
to Carver here, and...

13:06.495 --> 13:07.580
Carter.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.790
- I came up with a great idea.
- Really?

13:09.874 --> 13:11.083
Hit me. What do we have?

13:11.167 --> 13:12.835
How'd recruiting go?

13:12.918 --> 13:16.088
Oh, the usual. Yeah, no one joined.

13:16.172 --> 13:17.590
I think it's just a big joke at this point.

13:17.673 --> 13:18.757
It's not a joke.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.427
I think it's really cool
you guys have stuck with Scouts.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.721
One day you're gonna look back on this

13:23.804 --> 13:25.681
and you're gonna be
really happy you did it.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.517
Okay. Thanks.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.941
Looks like the deer made out
better than your car.

13:36.025 --> 13:38.277
Yeah. Wait, what? What do you mean?

13:38.986 --> 13:40.488
Well, where is it?

13:40.571 --> 13:42.239
It's right over there.

14:10.059 --> 14:12.144
Holy shit! Holy shit, man!

14:12.228 --> 14:13.729
You dick. What's wrong with you?

14:13.812 --> 14:16.315
Dude. Dude, okay. You're never
gonna believe what happened.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.998
Hey, you sure you guys
don't need a ride?

14:18.776 --> 14:20.194
No, we're good.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.320
See you boys tonight.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.239
Hey! See you tonight, man!

14:23.322 --> 14:25.491
All right? All right?

14:27.243 --> 14:29.578
Bye, Chloe! Bye!

14:30.746 --> 14:32.186
What are you talking about, tonight?

14:32.248 --> 14:33.999
Dude, you are never going
to guess what happened.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.127
We got invited to the secret
senior party, man. Look.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.922
Who cares? Look, the deer is gone.
What about the deer?

14:40.005 --> 14:41.257
Dude, fuck deers, man!

14:41.340 --> 14:44.677
We are going to the secret party, man!
Come on!

14:44.760 --> 14:46.845
I'm gonna fuck Chloe.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.098
I'm gonna fuck Chloe.

14:54.270 --> 14:55.938
Ben, come on.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.815
Okay. I mean,
quit acting like you don't want to go.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.358
Of course I want to go. I do.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.861
But it's Augie's big night.
He's getting his Condor Badge.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.030
We can't miss the ceremony
or he'd never forgive us.

15:05.114 --> 15:07.199
Okay, look, hear me out.

15:07.283 --> 15:08.909
We go to the campout,

15:08.993 --> 15:10.995
and when Augie and Rogers fall asleep,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.788
we will sneak out and go to the party.

15:12.871 --> 15:13.872
Carter...

15:13.956 --> 15:14.996
We'll be back before dawn,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.834
it'll be like we never even left.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.587
I don't know. It just sounds...

15:19.670 --> 15:20.671
Ben.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.300
This could be the night of our lives.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.552
Please.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.973
All right. I mean, I guess we could try.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.518
- Okay.
- I love you.

15:34.602 --> 15:36.729
You're amazing. Thank you!

15:36.812 --> 15:38.147
Whoa! What the hell?

15:38.814 --> 15:40.316
Hi, Mrs. Fielder. Hi.

15:41.483 --> 15:45.404
Your garbage cans were
blocking my driveway again.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.740
Had to move them myself,

15:47.823 --> 15:51.076
which is no easy task
with a herniated disk.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.161
Okay, great.

15:52.244 --> 15:56.749
You tell your father to keep his trash
on his side of the property.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.127
Okay, we'll do that, Mrs. Fielder.
Thank you.

16:00.210 --> 16:04.089
All right, thanks. Yep.
Can you just move right there?

16:04.173 --> 16:06.008
Thank you. Bye!

16:06.425 --> 16:07.843
Jesus Christ.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.179
You old hag! Okay. Thank you.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.597
She is so annoying.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.184
Oh, my God.
Can you imagine living next to that?

16:15.267 --> 16:18.395
Oh, my God. Dude,
how many cats does she have?

16:18.479 --> 16:20.981
Dude, who knows. She probably rubs
Fancy Feast on her cooch

16:21.065 --> 16:22.441
and lets them all go to town.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.525
What?

16:23.609 --> 16:27.071
Meet me here at 5:30 and then
we'll go to Camp Womp Womp.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.281
Then we'll go to the party. All right?

16:29.365 --> 16:30.949
- All right? All right.
- All right.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.117
See you soon, man.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.202
All right. See ya.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.546
Oh, litterbugs.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.839
Come on.

16:49.635 --> 16:50.969
Biotine?

16:52.888 --> 16:54.723
How'd you get way out here?

16:55.557 --> 16:58.060
Well, Peter Morris, finders keepers.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.233
Hello?

17:10.906 --> 17:12.074
Hello?

17:36.515 --> 17:38.100
What's wrong with you?

17:38.726 --> 17:40.060
You A-wipe!

17:40.519 --> 17:42.855
C-word! All the other words!

17:44.273 --> 17:45.774
Oh, doodle!

17:46.066 --> 17:47.401
That's my lucky knife!

18:04.042 --> 18:06.879
Teach you to mess
with Scout Leader Rogers!

18:21.226 --> 18:22.853
So we're just gonna
walk in there like this.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.855
No I.D.'s, just buy some beer?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.440
Just give me the $20, fool. Come on.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.400
Cough it up.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.444
Any day now. Come on.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.279
Hang on. It's Velcro. It takes a second.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.406
Watch a pro.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.621
Hi, sir. How are you today?

18:40.704 --> 18:41.872
Hey, baby.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.833
Oh, nice. Great plan, Carter.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.753
Just give the money to a drunk bum.
That'll work.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.672
Yeah!

18:50.756 --> 18:52.508
Just the cheap stuff.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.308
Did you see Officer Hottie?

19:01.391 --> 19:03.727
No. I was too busy
watching you lose 20 bucks.

19:03.811 --> 19:05.354
Okay, I gave him
very specific instructions.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.147
He's gonna buy us a couple of six packs,

19:07.231 --> 19:08.941
and he can keep the change.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.526
Jesus.

19:11.777 --> 19:12.778
Whoa.

19:14.363 --> 19:15.823
Holy shit, dude. That's her.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.533
What? Who?

19:17.616 --> 19:19.535
It's Denise What's-her-face.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.744
She went to our high school.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.228
She dropped out a couple years ago.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.581
Now she's a stripper.

19:24.665 --> 19:25.791
How do you even know that?

19:25.874 --> 19:27.209
She's a legend.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.547
What the fuck is he... Jesus Christ.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.884
Sir!

19:38.053 --> 19:40.389
I'm not paying for these items.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.391
Sir?

19:45.561 --> 19:46.895
- Shit!
- Oh, uh...

19:48.063 --> 19:51.066
It's okay. I got it. Seriously, I got it.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.988
Fucking ghetto-ass bag.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.239
Here.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.409
What are you doing?

20:00.492 --> 20:03.120
It's a sheet bend knot.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.288
It's impossible to break.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.372
You're pretty handy.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.249
Thanks.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.333
Get out.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.751
- Nice legs.
- Huh?

20:10.586 --> 20:12.337
Costume party?

20:12.421 --> 20:13.922
Oh, no, I'm...

20:14.339 --> 20:15.757
I'm a Scout.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.259
Like an actual Scout?

20:17.342 --> 20:18.822
Yeah, well. We got a campout tonight.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.097
So you work across the street?

20:22.180 --> 20:24.516
Yep. Glamorous, huh?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.935
Yeah. I mean, I've never been in,

20:27.019 --> 20:28.770
but I hear it's nice.

20:29.771 --> 20:30.939
It's got a good Yelp review.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.525
- What?
- Nothing.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.969
You're just... You're really cute.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.112
Thanks.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.197
Come on, Carter.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.700
Please tell me
you did not ask that guy to buy you beer.

20:41.783 --> 20:42.784
No, it was his idea.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.119
Rookies.

20:44.870 --> 20:45.871
Where are you...

20:45.954 --> 20:47.247
I need my $20 back.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.166
It's not all yours.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.628
You're dirty. Look how dirty...

20:58.133 --> 20:59.384
Here.

20:59.468 --> 21:00.844
Thank you.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.975
Thank you. Here.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.810
Oh, my God. Thank you.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.146
You're the most amazing person ever.
Thank you.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.481
Yeah. Thanks.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.942
It's cool. And thanks for the help, Legs.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.026
Yeah.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.071
Dude, what the fuck was that?

21:19.154 --> 21:20.364
Oh, my God.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.325
I would tongue-pound
her salty walrus any day of the week.

21:24.534 --> 21:25.577
Oh, shit.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.245
- He's staring at us.
- Go.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.933
Dude, I thought you said
that Kendall broke up with that Jeff guy.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.671
Dude, I thought so too.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.422
It's like, one moment, they're together

21:37.506 --> 21:39.925
and the next moment, they're broken up.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.343
So he's a dick.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.101
It's like no doubt...

21:49.184 --> 21:50.310
Hey, guys!

21:50.394 --> 21:51.436
Hey, what's up?

21:51.520 --> 21:53.855
All right. Campsite is halfway set up.

21:53.939 --> 21:54.940
- Nice.
- Great.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.441
- What's up?
- What's up?

21:56.525 --> 21:57.651
What's up?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.528
Oh! Too slow. Too slow, buddy.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.821
Where's Scout Leader Rogers?

22:00.904 --> 22:02.280
He was supposed to be
here to help me set up,

22:02.364 --> 22:03.532
but so far he's a no-show.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.618
That's weird. He's never late.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.787
Yeah. Maybe he quit Scouts.

22:08.954 --> 22:12.290
Quit Scouts? Yeah, right.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.875
That's hysterical!

22:13.959 --> 22:15.961
Want to know what I think it is?
I think it's a test.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.129
A test?

22:17.212 --> 22:19.172
Well, yeah.
I'm getting my Condor Badge today.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.133
I have to prove that I'm ready.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.551
Yeah, and check this out.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.394
I'm charting diets for
the Animal Study Badge

22:24.469 --> 22:25.721
and I walked right into that.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.639
- What is this?
- It's deer scat.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.393
Oh, dude! What the fuck, man?

22:31.727 --> 22:33.145
Carter! I needed that!

22:33.228 --> 22:34.980
You needed that? It's shit, Augie!

22:35.063 --> 22:36.648
No one needs shit!

22:36.732 --> 22:38.400
I need it!
I've been looking all week for it.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.444
Oh, God. It's gonna be a long night.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.239
Just feeding it through, in and out.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.741
Oh, yeah.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.576
There you go.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.828
- Good job, bud.
- I did it!

23:27.282 --> 23:29.367
What the fuck, man?
Was that your ass?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.857
Beans? Weenies?

24:00.941 --> 24:02.901
Why do we always
have to eat welfare food?

24:02.984 --> 24:04.778
Because we're camping, Carter.
What do you want?

24:04.861 --> 24:06.905
Something artisan.
Something that doesn't make me

24:06.988 --> 24:08.573
fart every five seconds.

24:08.657 --> 24:09.991
Shut up. Quit being such a bitch.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.828
Augie? Augie?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.830
Hey, Augie!

24:14.913 --> 24:15.914
Use my lighter.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.542
I'm not gonna get my Fire Making Badge
using a lighter, Carter.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.751
- Just use it.
- No!

24:19.835 --> 24:21.419
- Why?
- 'Cause!

24:21.503 --> 24:22.504
Augie.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.842
Augie, just use it.
You can get it next time.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.598
What the fuck?
Why the hell can't I get service?

24:33.682 --> 24:34.850
Carter, we're in the woods.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.476
I always get service up here.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.769
Maybe Mother Nature wants you

24:37.853 --> 24:40.272
to put the phone away, Carter,
and be in the moment.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.941
Oh, is that what Mother Nature wants?

24:43.024 --> 24:44.693
Maybe Mother Nature wants this.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.615
Fucking bull's-eye, man!

24:50.699 --> 24:52.450
You're an asshead, Carter.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.828
Wait! No, no, no, no! Don't take it off.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.705
Here we go. Wait. Hold still.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.791
Hold still. Ready? Say, "marshmallow."

25:00.208 --> 25:02.210
Carter sucks donkey balls.

25:03.587 --> 25:04.629
Wow.

25:04.713 --> 25:06.464
That's a thing of beauty.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.133
You better not post that.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.136
I'm definitely posting that.
It's my masterpiece.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.054
All right. BRB, guys. I got to pee.

25:17.893 --> 25:18.935
Barn owl?

25:19.728 --> 25:21.313
I think it's a spotted owl.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.732
Yeah, you're probably right.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.358
Hey.

25:25.442 --> 25:29.154
Guess what I found
when I was hiking up here?

25:29.237 --> 25:31.114
I found the tree
we carved our initials into.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.407
- No way!
- Yeah.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.491
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.327
Wow. That was like seven years ago.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.662
I know. Crazy, right?

25:37.746 --> 25:39.539
Oh. That was the same day
Carter sat on the cactus

25:39.623 --> 25:41.499
when he was taking a shit, right?

25:43.001 --> 25:45.041
And your dad had to pick out
the needles.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.672
Yeah.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.767
Augie, I know we don't talk
about your dad much,

26:00.435 --> 26:02.520
but it's okay if you want to.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.691
I just don't want to be
a downer, you know.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.276
Come on, Augie,
you're not being a downer.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.527
He was your dad.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.613
You can talk about him.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.616
Thanks, Ben.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.952
Yeah. Of course.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.288
Hey.

26:21.957 --> 26:22.999
Scouts forever?

26:24.626 --> 26:26.628
Yeah. Scouts forever.

26:41.476 --> 26:42.894
Ben. Hey.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.229
Come on, Ben. Let's go.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.730
Carter, I don't know about this.

26:45.814 --> 26:47.190
Will you stop crying about this?

26:47.274 --> 26:49.234
Let's go. Come on, we're doing this.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.569
Let's go. Come on.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.696
Come on.

27:41.536 --> 27:42.954
Are we interrupting?

27:46.374 --> 27:47.459
You look amazing.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.543
Thank you.

27:48.668 --> 27:49.878
Hey, have you guys seen my brother?

27:49.961 --> 27:51.463
He should have been here by now.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.299
No. I haven't seen him anywhere, no.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.676
But look,
I'm sure he'll be here any second. Okay?

27:59.554 --> 28:02.057
Dude. What if Augie wakes up
and we're not there?

28:02.140 --> 28:03.308
He's not gonna wake up.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.560
If Chewbacca was fucking
Bigfoot in our campsite,

28:05.643 --> 28:07.395
he'd still be asleep.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.605
Whoa.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.732
- What is that?
- What?

28:12.442 --> 28:14.235
Look. Look, he was here.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.529
Okay. So, he decided to go back home.

28:16.613 --> 28:17.614
He changed his mind.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.575
No, no, no. Scout Leader Rogers
would never leave his lucky knife.

28:20.658 --> 28:21.910
I think something's wrong.

28:21.993 --> 28:24.621
Dude, what's wrong
is us sitting here talking about this.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.955
Give me that.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.166
Dude, look. Look at his prints.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.585
His foot was dragging like
he had a limp or something.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.254
Okay.
Hurray for your mad tracking skills.

28:33.338 --> 28:35.507
Can we just... Can we go? Please?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.308
What?

28:45.392 --> 28:46.768
I just think something
really bad happened to him.

28:46.851 --> 28:49.104
- Are we still talking about Rogers?
- Yeah.

28:49.187 --> 28:51.439
Dude, he is sitting at home
dressed up like Dolly Parton

28:51.523 --> 28:53.191
singing show tunes. Relax.

28:57.612 --> 28:58.947
Oh, shit.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.118
Augie, wait! Augie!

29:03.201 --> 29:04.369
Augie!

29:06.287 --> 29:07.527
I thought we were best friends.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.665
We are best friends.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.625
- We were coming back.
- Really?

29:10.708 --> 29:12.168
After your party?

29:13.378 --> 29:14.879
You know about that?

29:14.963 --> 29:16.339
Everybody knows about
the senior party, Carter.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.715
Even a loser like me.

29:17.799 --> 29:18.842
Augie, don't say that.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.218
Why not? It's what you guys think!

29:20.301 --> 29:21.886
We don't think you're a loser.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.721
Ben, just tell him.

29:23.805 --> 29:24.806
Carter, no.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.474
Yeah, tell me, Ben.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.726
Come on! Say it!

29:28.810 --> 29:30.290
We're quitting Scouts, Augie.

29:33.481 --> 29:36.025
Look, it was fun when we were kids.

29:37.819 --> 29:41.364
But we have to grow up, man.

29:42.657 --> 29:45.243
Augie. We're still gonna be best friends.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.330
Go to your party.

29:51.249 --> 29:52.500
Augie.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.127
Augie, wait!

29:55.003 --> 29:56.671
Augie, come on!

30:00.175 --> 30:01.843
Just leave him, Ben.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.775
What the fuck...
What's wrong with the radio?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.110
Carter, are you seeing this?

30:19.194 --> 30:20.278
Seeing what?

30:20.361 --> 30:22.697
Look. The town's deserted.

30:24.365 --> 30:25.867
Everyone's probably asleep.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.368
On a Friday night?

30:28.286 --> 30:31.456
I don't know.
Something just feels really weird.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.957
Oh, hey. Pull over right here.

30:38.046 --> 30:40.882
I can't wait to get out of
these stupid uniforms.

30:41.466 --> 30:42.884
All right. Let's see here.

30:43.885 --> 30:46.471
We're just gonna change right here?

30:46.554 --> 30:47.889
Nobody's around.

30:48.723 --> 30:52.143
Let's see. Jeans. T-shirt.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.230
Condoms. Good to go. Uh...

30:55.897 --> 30:58.316
Forget socks? Yes, I did.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.824
- Holy shitballs!
- What?

31:06.908 --> 31:08.076
Dude, look.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.244
What?

31:09.327 --> 31:10.703
The bouncer, he's gone!

31:11.412 --> 31:12.830
Carter, someone smashed the door.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.165
We should sneak in.

31:14.249 --> 31:16.084
- That's illegal.
- Let's sneak in. Come on. Let's do it.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.327
Carter, we can't go in there!

31:17.377 --> 31:18.419
Come on!

31:18.503 --> 31:19.671
We can't go in there.
We're minors.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.005
It's the chance
of a lifetime. Who cares?

31:21.089 --> 31:22.131
What are you doing?

31:22.215 --> 31:23.675
It's gonna be awesome!

31:23.758 --> 31:25.927
Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait.

31:27.345 --> 31:30.348
Okay, it's clear. Come on. Let's do it.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.936
Sweet Jesus.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.438
This is it, Ben.

31:37.522 --> 31:38.898
We've made it.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.858
We're at the epicenter of pussy.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.195
Oh, shit.
I got to go to the ATM, get some cash.

31:44.279 --> 31:45.947
You find us a spot.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.201
Yeah. That shouldn't be too hard
since there's, like, nobody here.

33:23.628 --> 33:25.254
Hey!

33:25.380 --> 33:28.383
My friend brought me here.
He's getting money.

33:30.218 --> 33:32.804
I have a girlfriend, sort of.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.057
Don't worry, Mommy, Daddy's here!

33:37.975 --> 33:40.311
Dude, this is fucking awesome!

33:40.395 --> 33:41.646
Dude, something's wrong with her.

33:41.729 --> 33:44.190
Look at her chest. What's all over her?

33:44.273 --> 33:47.235
No, no. That's makeup, dummy.
It's a jungle theme.

33:48.945 --> 33:49.946
Oh, wow.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.823
This is so hot.

33:53.741 --> 33:54.909
Oh, my God.

33:55.576 --> 33:56.661
Oh, my God.

33:59.414 --> 34:01.165
Oh, my God!

34:06.838 --> 34:08.339
Run! Quick, run!

34:09.674 --> 34:11.759
Door, door, door, door!

35:27.668 --> 35:28.669
Ugh!

35:52.944 --> 35:54.862
Get up! Get up! Get up!

35:59.033 --> 36:01.285
- Carter!
- Ben? Ben.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.871
What the fuck is going on?

36:03.955 --> 36:05.122
I don't know! They're trying to kill us!

36:05.206 --> 36:07.375
- I just wanted to see some titties!
- I know!

36:07.875 --> 36:09.794
Wait. You're the stripper.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.088
Cocktail waitress.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.565
Scout Leader Rogers?

36:37.572 --> 36:39.740
Scout Leader Rogers, are you home?

36:49.750 --> 36:51.335
Hello?

37:11.606 --> 37:13.357
Holy cow.

37:18.321 --> 37:19.780
Calm the fuck down!

37:19.864 --> 37:22.064
Calm down? Are you crazy?
We almost got killed in there!

37:22.116 --> 37:23.367
- Is that your ride?
- Can you please just tell us

37:23.451 --> 37:24.535
what the hell is going on?

37:24.619 --> 37:25.953
I really need to wash up
my face right now!

37:26.037 --> 37:27.079
Keys, now!

37:27.163 --> 37:28.205
No! Not until you tell us
what's happening.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.457
Anybody got a wet nap?

37:29.582 --> 37:30.708
What the fuck do you
think is happening?

37:30.791 --> 37:31.876
Everyone's eating each other!

37:31.959 --> 37:33.753
- Wait, like a...
- Yes, like that!

37:33.836 --> 37:34.837
That's not possible.

37:34.921 --> 37:35.922
I think it's possible, Ben.

37:36.005 --> 37:38.716
A dead stripper just tried to eat my face!

37:38.841 --> 37:40.009
Oh, shit!

37:40.551 --> 37:42.053
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

37:42.553 --> 37:43.888
Just shoot it! Shoot it!

37:51.896 --> 37:53.230
Yep. Zombie.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.654
Any more questions?

38:09.330 --> 38:10.998
Drive, dude, go! Come on!

38:13.918 --> 38:15.586
Where are you going? What the fuck?

38:22.343 --> 38:23.344
Oh, shit!

38:25.680 --> 38:27.515
Carter, get the tire!

38:32.728 --> 38:33.896
I got it.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.482
Guys, hurry up!
They're getting pretty fucking close!

38:37.984 --> 38:40.152
- Come on!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

38:40.236 --> 38:41.445
Find the fucking lug nuts.

38:44.031 --> 38:45.032
Fuck.

38:47.702 --> 38:49.453
Seriously, hurry the fuck up!

38:49.537 --> 38:51.205
I got them! Here. Here.

38:51.539 --> 38:53.040
Put it on!

38:53.374 --> 38:55.042
Okay. Good. Put it on! Put it on!

38:55.292 --> 38:56.293
Fuck!

39:02.550 --> 39:03.551
I got it!

39:07.722 --> 39:08.806
Oh, shit!

39:08.889 --> 39:10.891
You got to be fucking kidding me.

39:16.731 --> 39:17.857
Go! Go! Go!

40:53.744 --> 40:55.704
Scout Leader Rogers!
What happened tonight?

40:55.788 --> 40:57.498
We were worried about you.

40:58.916 --> 41:02.920
I know. It's bad. I'm so sorry.
I had to use your bathroom.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.588
I think it was the beans.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.341
And the marshmallows.

41:08.676 --> 41:11.512
I tried spraying. It just lingers.

41:21.272 --> 41:22.314
Your neck!

41:24.859 --> 41:26.527
Scout Leader Rogers! Please!

41:30.739 --> 41:33.059
I think you're having a bad
allergic reaction to something!

41:33.117 --> 41:35.327
We need to get you to a doctor!

43:11.632 --> 43:13.676
"All evacuation
buses have departed.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.094
"Proceed north on Route 1

43:15.177 --> 43:17.554
"to the security checkpoint
at mile marker 17."

43:17.638 --> 43:19.974
Oh, shit. They evacuated the town.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.058
That's great.

43:21.141 --> 43:22.701
I missed the party, and I missed Chloe,

43:22.768 --> 43:24.895
- and now I'm gonna die.
- Guys.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.063
Carter, calm down!
We need to figure out

43:26.146 --> 43:27.690
- what we're gonna do.
- Guys!

43:33.988 --> 43:35.072
Come on.

43:38.325 --> 43:39.827
Go, go, go!

43:39.910 --> 43:41.578
- Carter, lock it!
- I'm trying to fuckin' lock it, man!

43:41.662 --> 43:42.663
It's not working.

43:45.499 --> 43:47.418
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

43:47.501 --> 43:48.669
Move!

43:50.754 --> 43:51.755
Come on!

44:07.604 --> 44:09.106
Carter, get the ax!

44:27.624 --> 44:29.144
Go, go, go.

44:33.213 --> 44:34.882
They're coming!

44:50.397 --> 44:51.398
This way!

44:52.649 --> 44:53.817
Fuck!

45:07.247 --> 45:09.750
This is fucking awesome! Now what?

45:14.671 --> 45:18.008
I'm really sorry
I set you on fire, Scout Leader Rogers.

45:18.092 --> 45:19.812
But hopefully, it's not as bad as it looks.

45:22.763 --> 45:24.431
I used a double overhand stopper knot.

45:25.641 --> 45:27.601
It's hard to get out of, right?

45:28.143 --> 45:29.144
Oh!

45:29.937 --> 45:31.688
Okay. All right.

45:35.943 --> 45:38.946
Okay, now. I'll be right back.

45:39.613 --> 45:41.031
Just stay there.

46:10.269 --> 46:11.728
Dude, what the fuck?

46:12.312 --> 46:14.064
Haven't you had enough to eat? Jesus.

46:15.107 --> 46:16.567
Carter, stop agitating them.

46:16.650 --> 46:18.110
What? I need a new profile pic.

46:21.947 --> 46:24.533
So, do you think
they evacuated everyone at the party?

46:24.616 --> 46:26.034
Yeah, of course. They had to.

46:27.244 --> 46:29.121
At least we know our parents are okay.

46:29.204 --> 46:30.873
- Yeah.
- Where are they?

46:30.956 --> 46:33.625
They went to some
lame spiritual yoga retreat.

46:33.709 --> 46:35.544
Ugh. I think I'd rather be in here.

46:41.425 --> 46:42.968
I hope Augie's okay.

46:43.051 --> 46:45.304
- Who's Augie?
- He's our best friend.

46:45.387 --> 46:47.055
Well, ex-best friend now.

46:47.473 --> 46:48.515
Why ex?

46:48.599 --> 46:50.225
Because we ditched him for a party.

46:50.309 --> 46:51.810
Ben, we were gonna go back.

46:51.894 --> 46:53.937
Whatever, Carter. We ditched him.
We're bad friends.

46:54.021 --> 46:56.190
Why didn't you guys
just take him with you?

46:57.983 --> 46:59.735
You don't know Augie.

46:59.818 --> 47:01.570
- What?
- He's just different.

47:01.653 --> 47:02.738
Big geek?

47:02.821 --> 47:04.907
He collects deer shit
and weaves baskets.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.283
Okay? You do the math.

47:07.159 --> 47:08.243
Okay.

47:08.327 --> 47:09.453
Word of advice,

47:09.536 --> 47:11.497
chasing parties and popularity
in high school?

47:11.580 --> 47:12.789
It's a total dead end.

47:12.873 --> 47:14.333
None of that shit will matter later.

47:14.416 --> 47:16.084
Trust me. I know.

47:16.168 --> 47:18.253
You're right, but didn't you,
like, drop out of high school?

47:18.378 --> 47:20.088
- No, I got my GED.
- Why?

47:20.214 --> 47:22.424
'Cause not everybody has
a lily-white life like you do.

47:22.508 --> 47:24.301
Okay. God, you're so hostile.

47:24.384 --> 47:27.012
No, hostile is three seconds from
now when my foot's up your ass.

47:27.095 --> 47:28.514
Okay, yeah. Try all you want,

47:28.597 --> 47:29.890
but I happen to have
a very tight asshole.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.533
I think I could stretch it out for you.

47:31.558 --> 47:33.018
Oh, well, then lube me up, baby.

47:33.101 --> 47:35.771
Carter! We're gonna play
the quiet game now, okay?

47:37.064 --> 47:38.941
All right, you know what? Fine.

47:39.608 --> 47:41.276
I'm over both of you.

47:50.577 --> 47:52.412
You're pretty good at that.

47:52.496 --> 47:54.998
Yeah, I guess
that Whittling Badge finally paid off.

47:59.127 --> 48:00.379
What about you?

48:00.462 --> 48:01.672
What about me?

48:01.755 --> 48:04.091
How'd you learn
to use a shotgun like that?

48:05.259 --> 48:08.345
My ex-boyfriend was really into guns.

48:08.428 --> 48:11.265
He used to drag me to
the firing range once a week.

48:11.348 --> 48:12.349
Oh.

48:12.766 --> 48:15.435
So, no boyfriend now?

48:15.519 --> 48:16.853
Not if I can help it.

48:17.813 --> 48:19.356
Well, why do you say that?

48:19.439 --> 48:20.983
I don't know.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.610
Let's just say,
I have really shitty taste in guys.

48:23.944 --> 48:26.029
I'm better off alone.

48:26.113 --> 48:27.990
Nobody's better off alone.

48:28.073 --> 48:29.449
Yeah, well, I am.

48:31.159 --> 48:32.828
Aww,
what a beautiful moment.

48:33.787 --> 48:35.414
Ow! Asshole, that hurt!

48:35.497 --> 48:37.374
- Yeah, that was the point!
- Oh, was that the point?

48:37.457 --> 48:38.667
Guys! Shh!

48:39.042 --> 48:40.252
Do you hear that?

48:40.335 --> 48:41.545
Is that <i>Crank That?</i>

48:43.714 --> 48:45.048
They're leaving.

48:45.340 --> 48:46.383
I love this song!

48:46.466 --> 48:47.509
You would.

48:58.645 --> 48:59.855
Look! Right there.

48:59.980 --> 49:00.939
Fuck. But they're gonna come back.

49:01.023 --> 49:02.065
What are we gonna do?

49:02.149 --> 49:03.525
- Condoms!
- What?

49:03.650 --> 49:06.194
Carter, give me your condoms! Hurry!

49:08.238 --> 49:10.324
Here. Take them
and open them and tie them together.

49:10.407 --> 49:11.408
Why are we doing this?

49:11.491 --> 49:12.618
- Just do it!
- Okay, okay.

49:12.701 --> 49:13.869
Here's one.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.329
Come on, hurry!

49:40.270 --> 49:42.522
Here we go. Fly fishing. It's genius.

49:43.690 --> 49:46.777
Go on, just a little bit.
Get it right up there.

49:46.860 --> 49:48.862
There you go. Come on.

49:48.945 --> 49:49.988
It's right up there!

49:51.740 --> 49:53.575
You got it, come on.

49:55.869 --> 49:58.038
Good work. Yes! Yes!

49:58.914 --> 49:59.915
No, no, no!

50:01.875 --> 50:02.918
Jesus!

50:03.001 --> 50:04.001
You got arrested?

50:04.044 --> 50:05.170
No,
we locked ourselves in.

50:05.253 --> 50:06.505
- How?
- It was an accident!

50:06.588 --> 50:07.964
This has to be Augie.

50:08.048 --> 50:09.091
Augie, get the keys.

50:09.216 --> 50:11.016
You kicked them
into the drainpipe over there.

50:12.219 --> 50:13.637
- I can't reach it!
- Shit!

50:13.720 --> 50:14.846
Shit, they're coming back.

50:14.930 --> 50:16.056
Hold on.

50:17.182 --> 50:19.184
What, is there a
Lockpicking Badge I'm unaware of?

50:19.893 --> 50:20.894
How'd you find us?

50:21.019 --> 50:22.299
Followed the stench of betrayal.

50:22.354 --> 50:23.355
Augie...

50:23.438 --> 50:25.691
I saw your car. I figured I'd help.

50:25.774 --> 50:27.442
- Augie, look, I'm really...
- Got it!

50:36.118 --> 50:38.453
Go, go, go!

50:43.750 --> 50:44.918
Close the gate!

50:53.135 --> 50:54.803
Oh...

50:56.805 --> 50:58.473
...my...

51:00.308 --> 51:02.978
...God.

51:03.437 --> 51:04.438
Carter, let's go!

51:06.606 --> 51:08.442
- Come on!
- Okay!

51:09.818 --> 51:12.237
Oh, God. I touched them!
I touched them!

51:12.320 --> 51:13.822
I don't think they were real.

51:18.326 --> 51:20.579
Fuck,
my feet are killing me.

51:20.662 --> 51:23.081
The security checkpoint's
only a few miles away.

51:23.165 --> 51:25.709
Dude, I'm starving.

51:25.792 --> 51:29.379
How can you even think of food
when people are being eaten alive?

51:29.463 --> 51:32.215
You know, they say that
humans taste like pork.

51:32.299 --> 51:33.717
"They"?

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
Cannibals, I guess.

51:34.843 --> 51:36.261
Dude, I love bacon.

51:36.344 --> 51:37.596
Hey, look.

51:37.679 --> 51:39.473
Maybe the keys are inside.

51:46.646 --> 51:47.814
Jesus! This guy again?

51:47.898 --> 51:49.441
Someone kill him!

51:49.524 --> 51:52.068
Carter, we can't just keep
going around killing people.

51:52.152 --> 51:53.236
Why not?

51:53.320 --> 51:54.400
Because he's a human being!

51:54.446 --> 51:55.566
Okay. We'll see how you feel

51:55.655 --> 51:57.575
when he's eating
your nutsack like a street taco.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.203
Um, guys, he's getting pretty close.

52:01.286 --> 52:02.746
Remember our
Wilderness Safety Seminar?

52:02.829 --> 52:03.829
What?

52:03.872 --> 52:06.082
When encountering a hostile creature,
be sure to assert yourself

52:06.166 --> 52:07.751
in order to keep the animal at bay.

52:07.834 --> 52:09.127
Well, I...

52:10.545 --> 52:12.881
That is a zombie, not a bear, dumbass.

52:26.853 --> 52:27.938
Guys, I think he's mimicking me.

52:28.021 --> 52:29.356
Augie, quit messing around.

52:34.402 --> 52:35.487
Augie.

52:49.042 --> 52:50.043
What?

52:52.629 --> 52:53.922
Augie, what are you doing?

53:05.851 --> 53:07.060
What are you doing?

53:22.033 --> 53:23.493
Okay. Did I just drop acid,

53:23.577 --> 53:26.079
or are they really singing
Britney Spears with a zombie?

53:44.681 --> 53:45.932
Is that all of you?

53:46.016 --> 53:47.517
Yeah. What the hell's happening?

53:47.601 --> 53:50.020
Don't know yet.
Some kind of viral outbreak.

53:50.103 --> 53:52.439
CDC ordered a military
containment perimeter.

53:52.522 --> 53:53.648
Is most of the town evacuated?

53:53.732 --> 53:55.025
As many as we could.

53:55.108 --> 53:57.777
This thing hit so hard and fast,
we're still trying to contain it.

53:57.903 --> 54:00.023
What about everyone at the party?
Were they evacuated?

54:00.614 --> 54:01.781
What party?

54:43.823 --> 54:46.076
Well, where is everybody?

54:46.159 --> 54:48.828
Nobody's here. It must be a mistake.

54:49.663 --> 54:52.082
Yeah, 1146 Dunton Avenue. This is it.

54:52.165 --> 54:55.251
It's not a mistake, Carter.
Jeff sent you a fake address.

54:55.335 --> 54:56.503
What?

54:56.586 --> 54:58.171
Carter, this is a waste plant.

54:58.254 --> 55:00.256
You get it? It's full of shit.

55:01.758 --> 55:03.969
Motherfucker! God damn it!

55:04.302 --> 55:06.721
I can't believe he sent us
a fucking fake address!

55:06.805 --> 55:07.889
Why does it surprise you?

55:07.973 --> 55:10.734
I mean, did you actually think
he was gonna invite us to a real party?

55:11.518 --> 55:12.686
Karma.

55:13.186 --> 55:14.270
What?

55:14.354 --> 55:16.022
- Nothing.
- No, speak up.

55:16.147 --> 55:17.732
Well, I just think it's a little ironic

55:17.816 --> 55:20.694
that, you know, you're all upset now
because you got ditched.

55:20.860 --> 55:23.446
Oh, okay.
So you're saying that we deserve it.

55:23.530 --> 55:25.156
We went to your stupid campout, dude.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.783
You lied to me.

55:26.866 --> 55:28.786
We've been lying to you
for the past three years!

55:28.827 --> 55:30.328
- Carter!
- Going to every Scout meeting,

55:30.412 --> 55:31.621
every lame field trip.

55:31.705 --> 55:32.956
Wearing these stupid fucking clothes

55:33.039 --> 55:34.124
so everybody can make fun of us.

55:34.207 --> 55:35.208
Carter, that's enough!

55:35.333 --> 55:37.013
Ben, you're not hiding
behind me this time.

55:37.085 --> 55:38.128
Tell him.

55:38.211 --> 55:39.337
Talk about how many times

55:39.421 --> 55:41.423
you said you hated Scouts,
how sick of it you were.

55:41.506 --> 55:43.299
- I never said that.
- Bullshit!

55:43.383 --> 55:44.467
No, no, no. It's fine.

55:44.551 --> 55:46.511
I guess it's time
for it to all come out, right?

55:47.178 --> 55:49.389
He's had a crush on Kendall
since sixth grade.

55:49.514 --> 55:50.890
- That is not true!
- Yes, it is.

55:51.016 --> 55:53.059
- Kendall? As in my sister Kendall?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:53.184 --> 55:54.602
- No.
- Dude, that's like incest.

55:54.686 --> 55:55.854
No, it's not, I'm not even related to her.

55:55.937 --> 55:56.980
So you do like her, then.

55:57.063 --> 55:58.523
- No, I don't like her!
- Told you.

55:58.606 --> 55:59.733
Shut up!

56:00.108 --> 56:01.109
Stop!

56:01.860 --> 56:04.320
Again with this shit? Jesus.

56:04.404 --> 56:05.905
Can't you just walkie someone?

56:07.699 --> 56:09.409
Hey, are you okay?

56:11.369 --> 56:13.121
Guys!

56:13.204 --> 56:14.914
Shit!

56:17.000 --> 56:18.168
Get him!

56:21.588 --> 56:26.092
I'm so fucking sick of zombies!

56:27.761 --> 56:28.845
Yikes.

56:28.928 --> 56:29.929
Wa-wa-wee-wa.

56:35.060 --> 56:36.144
Shit!

56:40.565 --> 56:41.983
Hello! Is anybody there?

56:42.067 --> 56:43.443
<i>Evac complete.</i>

56:43.777 --> 56:44.903
No, no, no, no. We're still here!

56:44.986 --> 56:46.279
<i>We have Operation Clean Up.</i>

56:46.946 --> 56:50.283
<i>Commence aerial bombing
of site at 0300. Repeat, 0300. Over.</i>

56:50.366 --> 56:51.576
What?

56:51.659 --> 56:53.912
No, somebody help! Hello! Hello!

56:53.995 --> 56:56.206
Somebody help, please! Hello!

56:56.289 --> 56:57.373
Fuck!

56:57.457 --> 56:59.209
They're gonna bomb
the town in two hours?

56:59.292 --> 57:00.335
What are we gonna do?

57:00.418 --> 57:01.544
We have to find Kendall and the others!

57:01.628 --> 57:03.171
It's a secret party.
They could be anywhere.

57:03.338 --> 57:04.339
Shit.

57:05.090 --> 57:06.257
My sister's diary!

57:06.633 --> 57:09.385
She writes every last
boring detail of her life in there.

57:09.469 --> 57:12.388
I guarantee she wrote down
where the party is.

57:12.472 --> 57:13.973
We better get fucking going, then.

57:39.833 --> 57:40.834
Okay, now.

58:14.325 --> 58:15.702
All right, come on.

58:26.212 --> 58:28.798
Whew! It smells like
Pixy Stix and hope in here.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.551
You've never been in a girl's
room before, have you?

58:31.676 --> 58:33.761
- Yeah, I...
- Mom doesn't count.

58:33.845 --> 58:35.138
- Well...
- Any female relative doesn't count.

58:35.221 --> 58:37.682
Guys! Can we focus? Where's the diary?

58:38.141 --> 58:40.059
She changes the hiding place,
like, every week,

58:40.185 --> 58:41.728
so just spread out and start looking.

58:59.329 --> 59:00.830
- Did you find it?
- Nope.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.082
Nothing over here.

59:16.846 --> 59:17.847
Hey.

59:18.264 --> 59:19.349
Did you guys hear that?

59:19.432 --> 59:20.433
Hear what?

59:21.893 --> 59:23.895
I think I heard
something downstairs.

59:24.938 --> 59:26.272
Augie, go check it out.

59:26.356 --> 59:27.857
I'm not going down there by myself.

59:27.941 --> 59:29.400
- Go with him.
- Why me?

59:29.484 --> 59:31.402
Call me when your balls drop, dude.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.202
Shh! Don't walk so hard.

59:39.285 --> 59:41.454
You have squeaky floors.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.291
This is Carter's sister?

59:46.960 --> 59:48.294
Yeah. That's Kendall.

59:49.295 --> 59:51.297
Well, she clearly won the genetic lottery.

59:51.631 --> 59:54.342
Yeah. She's okay. I guess.

59:54.425 --> 59:55.718
Dude, she's more than okay.

59:55.802 --> 59:57.470
You don't have to be all cool about it.

59:59.097 --> 01:00:00.431
Shit.

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.143
Fuck. Come on.

01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:07.897
So, how come
you haven't told her you like her?

01:00:07.981 --> 01:00:09.315
What's the point?

01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:11.401
She's never gonna go for a guy like me.

01:00:11.484 --> 01:00:13.069
And she's got a boyfriend.

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:15.905
And Carter would kill me
if I touched his sister.

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:18.199
Okay, look. Here's the deal.

01:00:18.283 --> 01:00:21.077
And don't take this the wrong way,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.371
but you have to man up.

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:25.331
Yeah, but I suck at being that guy.

01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:27.041
I'm not assertive like that.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:28.126
Kiss me.

01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:29.585
What?

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:31.149
Don't "what" me, just do it. Kiss me.

01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:33.172
Are you serious?

01:00:33.256 --> 01:00:34.841
Yeah, I'm serious.
I saw you checking out my ass earlier.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.175
I know you want to do it. Just kiss me.

01:00:36.301 --> 01:00:37.343
- No, I wasn't.
- Ben!

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:39.262
- Okay, for a second I did.
- Kiss me.

01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:41.431
Denise, I...

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:43.016
You can do it. Just go for it.

01:00:45.852 --> 01:00:47.103
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Oh, fuck! Fuck.

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:48.786
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:00:48.855 --> 01:00:49.856
See? I told you
we shouldn't have done that.

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:50.940
It was a bad idea.

01:00:51.024 --> 01:00:52.358
No, no, no. Let's just try it again.

01:00:52.442 --> 01:00:54.610
No, I feel stupid.
We should look for the diary.

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:55.862
Come here.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.001
Not bad.

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:11.794
Really?

01:01:11.878 --> 01:01:14.297
It wasn't, like, top five or anything.
Don't get excited.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.257
- But, yeah, it was okay.
- Oh.

01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:19.052
When you see Kendall,
just walk straight up to her,

01:01:19.135 --> 01:01:20.303
lay some of that shit on her,

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:21.888
and you're golden.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.515
Okay. Thanks.

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:31.481
Guess we left it open.

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:33.483
Hey, Augie.

01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:39.072
Ben didn't want to leave you tonight.

01:01:41.282 --> 01:01:43.076
It was my idea.

01:01:44.077 --> 01:01:45.661
What difference does it make?

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.080
It's done.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:52.835
Yeah.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.011
Oh, fuck!

01:02:13.523 --> 01:02:14.607
Come on.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.450
What the hell
is going on down there?

01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:18.778
We're fine! Everything's under control!

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:45.388
No! No, no, no, no. Fucking, no!
Not my ass!

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:48.558
Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:53.980
My ass! My ass!

01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:56.315
She's gumming my ass!

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:57.817
Oh, my God!

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.901
Carter!

01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:01.904
Oh, God! Oh, it's disgusting!

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:09.662
Carter!

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.166
Peace out, bitch!

01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:18.671
What the hell happened?

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.758
Shit. Back upstairs! Back upstairs!

01:03:30.308 --> 01:03:31.601
Come on, come on!

01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:33.269
Move it!

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:35.730
That's not gonna hold them!

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.565
- Did you find the journal?
- No! We looked everywhere!

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:39.025
Guys, we got to go! Come on!

01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:55.958
Oh, my God! They're coming!

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.754
Guys, if we jump,
we might be able to clear the fence!

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.547
- What?
- Fuck it, let's just jump!

01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:03.174
The fence is like 10 feet away!

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.801
- I'll go first!
- Go, go!

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:12.850
Okay. Go, go, go!

01:04:19.815 --> 01:04:21.567
Augie, you got to go now!

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.861
Hurry!

01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:24.987
I can't, I'm afraid of heights!

01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.656
Be more afraid of zombies! Go!

01:05:07.697 --> 01:05:09.448
Is that his wiener?

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:12.076
We got to do something.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:14.370
Guys, help me! I'm falling!

01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:16.372
Hang on to that cock, Ben!

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:18.708
Guys, hurry! Help me!

01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:22.211
What are you doing?

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:25.548
Hey! Assholes! Come and get me.

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:31.387
Hurry!

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:33.723
It's ripping!

01:05:37.226 --> 01:05:39.395
His dick's ripping!

01:05:58.039 --> 01:05:59.248
- I got it!
- Dude!

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:03.544
- I got it.
- Where was it?

01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.004
- Underwear drawer.
- Classic.

01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:07.214
Run!

01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.095
Lock it.

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:15.014
Augie, get the lights.

01:06:16.098 --> 01:06:17.600
The power's out.

01:06:18.184 --> 01:06:19.852
Where the hell are we?

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.605
Mrs. Fielder's house.

01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:24.615
I can't believe we
just chopped her head off.

01:06:24.649 --> 01:06:27.109
She tried to eat my ass, Augie.
She deserved it.

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:29.362
Guys, we got to keep moving. Come on.

01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:45.336
Carter, check the window.

01:06:49.382 --> 01:06:51.175
Shit, they're everywhere.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.760
Miss Fielder's car is in the garage.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.887
Maybe we can get out that way.
This way.

01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:11.612
What was that?

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:13.239
I think something's in here.

01:07:15.074 --> 01:07:16.075
Fuck, cat.

01:07:23.249 --> 01:07:24.250
Augie?

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:25.626
Dude, dude.

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.461
- Augie.
- What?

01:07:27.545 --> 01:07:29.463
Don't move.

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:43.185
- Did you get it?
- I got it! I got it!

01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:49.900
Run!

01:07:55.948 --> 01:07:58.284
Come on, come on, come on!

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.369
Open the garage door!

01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:01.704
It won't open!

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.205
Go! Ben, go!

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:04.498
Fuck it!

01:08:15.551 --> 01:08:17.390
Oh, my God.
It's Scout Leader Rogers!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.930
He looks like shit!

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:21.223
I set him on fire.

01:08:21.599 --> 01:08:23.309
- What?
- He tried to eat me!

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.982
- Wait, what are you doing?
- No, don't...

01:08:38.407 --> 01:08:39.825
Sorry, bro!

01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:59.720
All right, the diary said they're at
the old rec center on Dewer Street.

01:08:59.804 --> 01:09:01.346
Hopefully, we're not too late.

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:03.350
All right,
I'll try to get help as soon as I can.

01:09:03.432 --> 01:09:05.017
Just be careful.

01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:14.819
- Denise.
- Yeah?

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.947
Look, I don't know what's gonna happen,

01:09:18.948 --> 01:09:20.323
but I just wanted to let you know that

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:22.207
you're one of
the coolest girls I've ever met.

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:28.374
And, uh, I hope
you meet someone that deserves you.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:30.960
Thanks.

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:02.408
Guys, let's go.
We got to get to the party.

01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:04.869
Ben, this is a suicide mission.

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:06.662
Guys, they're gonna
bomb this whole town

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:07.830
in less than two hours.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.832
What if Denise reaches
the military in time?

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.709
And what if she doesn't, Carter?
Then what?

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:14.253
Who's gonna save them?
The police? They're gone.

01:10:14.336 --> 01:10:17.339
The military? They're not coming, either.

01:10:18.007 --> 01:10:20.342
Guys, we're the last line of defense.

01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:24.346
And so what? Maybe we look
like dorks in these uniforms.

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:27.391
And maybe we're a big joke
to everyone at school.

01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:31.186
But tonight,

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.551
we're gonna show them
what being a real Scout's all about.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.569
So, are we just gonna stand here
with our thumbs up our asses?

01:10:39.194 --> 01:10:41.780
Or are we gonna go out there
and save the world?

01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:44.366
Fuck, yeah, dude.

01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:47.202
That was a really good speech, Ben.

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:49.038
Thanks, Augie.

01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:50.456
Let's do it.

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:55.210
The rec center's that way.

01:10:56.879 --> 01:10:58.881
We're making a pit stop first.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.871
Are you serious?

01:12:13.914 --> 01:12:17.209
None of my text messages
are going through, Travis.

01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:18.794
Don't worry about that, baby.

01:12:18.877 --> 01:12:20.629
Where are you taking me?

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:23.382
Um, it's a surprise.

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.785
You need a little spanking, don't you?

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:28.220
Ew.

01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:30.305
Travis, what the fuck?

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:31.640
Come on.

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.143
Okay, this place is disgusting.

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:36.979
I need to examine you.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:38.564
- Get over here.
- Oh, okay.

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:43.485
God, you're so sexy.

01:12:43.819 --> 01:12:44.987
Thank you.

01:12:46.822 --> 01:12:48.991
Okay, we're not about to fuck right now.

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:50.325
Why not?

01:12:50.909 --> 01:12:53.412
Because we've only
been dating for, like, two minutes.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:54.496
What about a blow job?

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.166
Travis, I spent an hour
trying to find this piece of gum.

01:12:58.167 --> 01:12:59.501
Sucks.

01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:04.089
Okay, fine. You can eat me out.

01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:06.091
- Really?
- Yes. You're welcome.

01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:16.018
<i>When I'm in jail</i>

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:18.103
<i>the first thing you do
is talk to another chick.</i>

01:13:18.187 --> 01:13:19.521
What the fuck?

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:25.861
Hey, pervert, fuck off!

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:31.200
You serious, bro?

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.875
<i>I was in jail!</i>

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.630
Hello? Are you going to do it or what?

01:13:58.268 --> 01:14:02.189
Ooh! Your mouth's kind of cold.

01:14:12.574 --> 01:14:13.575
Stop.

01:14:14.576 --> 01:14:16.745
- Stop!
- Come on, babe.

01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:18.747
- Stop it!
- What the fuck's your problem?

01:14:18.831 --> 01:14:19.998
I'm worried about my brother.

01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:21.667
He should've been here hours ago.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:22.876
He's not coming, babe.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.253
How do you know?

01:14:24.336 --> 01:14:26.672
Because I gave him the wrong address.

01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:28.841
- What?
- They're Scouts, Kendall!

01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:31.426
Look, what'd you think,
I was gonna invite them for real?

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:34.012
- Come here.
- You are such a dick!

01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:35.973
- What? You're not leaving.
- Watch me!

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:37.391
You're not going!

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:40.853
Fine, go, bitch!

01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:46.358
Oh, Jesus, girl.
Get a fucking tampon, would you?

01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:58.453
Someone help!

01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:02.708
Help! Please, someone help!

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:14.279
All right, Scouts,
let's kick some zombie ass.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:50.941
Boom.

01:17:07.499 --> 01:17:08.500
Chloe?

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:09.668
Oh, man.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:13.463
Nailed it.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.030
What a dick.

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:43.535
Ben, they're everywhere!

01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:45.203
Circle up!

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:51.793
You want some of this?

01:17:51.877 --> 01:17:54.504
You assholes! Die!

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:57.674
Come on! You want a piece of me?

01:18:00.177 --> 01:18:02.137
Ben! Ben!

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.014
Help!

01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:10.228
Ben!

01:18:10.354 --> 01:18:11.730
Hang on, Kendall! I'm coming!

01:18:14.024 --> 01:18:15.192
Oh, shit.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.194
Oh, shit. Shit, start! Come on!

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:18.862
Ben, look out!

01:18:19.029 --> 01:18:20.030
Shit.

01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:33.043
Ben, duck!

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:40.258
Ben!

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:43.720
Kendall, come down! Climb down, hurry!

01:18:46.598 --> 01:18:48.100
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:18:48.225 --> 01:18:49.559
Guys, come on!

01:18:49.643 --> 01:18:50.936
- Come on.
- Come on!

01:18:51.228 --> 01:18:53.939
We got to get everyone out of here!
Let's go!

01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:57.234
Everybody! Get to the stairs! Come on!

01:19:04.074 --> 01:19:05.117
Let's go!

01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:06.743
Come on, everybody, move!

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:10.747
Hurry up! Come on, come on! Let's go!

01:19:10.956 --> 01:19:12.082
Let's go!

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:13.917
Let's go! Come on!

01:19:14.084 --> 01:19:15.127
Oh, shit!

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:21.174
What are you doing?

01:19:21.258 --> 01:19:23.009
They'll follow you if we don't
lock the doors! You gotta go!

01:19:23.093 --> 01:19:24.813
- What about you?
- You got to go! Trust me!

01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:26.304
I'm not leaving you! No!

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.265
Go! Go! Trust me!

01:19:36.314 --> 01:19:37.649
- I'm out!
- Oh, shit!

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:40.318
There's too many of them!
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:41.820
Let's go!

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:43.488
Oh, fuck!

01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:45.699
Let's go!

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:46.950
Come on!

01:19:52.164 --> 01:19:53.957
Hurry, come on!

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:55.792
Go, Augie, go!

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.628
Run! Run!

01:20:10.098 --> 01:20:11.850
Where's the door?

01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:14.019
There's got to be another exit.

01:20:14.102 --> 01:20:15.520
I don't see one!

01:20:15.604 --> 01:20:17.272
- We're trapped.
- Shit.

01:20:17.606 --> 01:20:19.046
- There's no way out of here.
- Fuck.

01:20:21.276 --> 01:20:22.694
- What do we do?
- Give me your backpack.

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.863
What? What are you doing?

01:20:30.202 --> 01:20:31.870
- What is that?
- It's a bomb.

01:20:32.204 --> 01:20:33.246
You made a bomb?

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:34.539
What are you, the Taliban?

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.584
Either we die fast or we're eaten alive
and turn into one of those things!

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:40.170
Your choice.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:44.549
- Shit.
- Carter, give me your lighter.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.801
Here.

01:20:51.223 --> 01:20:52.557
Are you guys ready?

01:20:56.853 --> 01:20:58.522
- Wait!
- What?

01:20:59.064 --> 01:21:00.106
I need to say something.

01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.483
Ben, it's fine.

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:03.326
- You don't have to do this.
- No, I do.

01:21:03.985 --> 01:21:05.865
We should have never
ditched you tonight, Augie.

01:21:06.321 --> 01:21:08.406
What we did was really messed up.

01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:10.825
He's right.
We've been complete D-bags.

01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:13.119
It's my fault.
I never should have made you guys think

01:21:13.203 --> 01:21:14.746
you had to be in Scouts for just me.

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:16.414
No, that's just it!

01:21:16.498 --> 01:21:18.792
I thought I wanted out,
but I was just worried

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.753
what other people were gonna think.
The truth is,

01:21:23.171 --> 01:21:25.006
I love being a Scout.

01:21:26.007 --> 01:21:29.010
And I love it because
it's the reason I met you guys.

01:21:32.097 --> 01:21:35.267
And I know tonight's been
really crazy and fucked up,

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:36.768
but one good thing has happened.

01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:38.895
And it's this, right now.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:41.231
Us.

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:43.024
Being back together.

01:21:45.694 --> 01:21:47.028
Scouts forever.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:51.533
Scouts forever.

01:21:53.702 --> 01:21:54.703
Scouts forever.

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:03.712
Ben? Is it really lame
if I hold your hand right now?

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:05.046
No.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.135
Oh, God damn it. This stupid thing!

01:22:11.219 --> 01:22:12.887
- What are you doing?
- It's out of fluid!

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.222
Here. Give me that.

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.600
Wait, do you have another lighter?

01:22:20.395 --> 01:22:22.564
God damn it, Augie,
we were supposed to die fast!

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:26.568
This is gonna hurt so bad.

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:28.153
Come on, Augie, you can do it!

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:30.488
Don't pressure me! I hate that!

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:34.618
Yo, dipshits!
You just gonna sit there or what?

01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:37.579
Where'd she come from?

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:41.416
Augie, leave it!

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:49.883
Augie, let's go!

01:23:28.296 --> 01:23:29.714
Are you guys okay?

01:23:29.798 --> 01:23:31.883
I'm alive. I'm alive!

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:33.718
Oh, my God! Augie!

01:23:33.802 --> 01:23:35.804
- Dude! You're a genius!
- It worked!

01:23:35.887 --> 01:23:37.305
That was fucking awesome!

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:38.723
- Fuck, yeah, man!
- It worked!

01:23:40.809 --> 01:23:42.102
What the fuck?

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.312
Is that Scout Leader Rogers?

01:23:46.815 --> 01:23:48.942
You got to hand it to him.
The man is a fighter.

01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:52.821
Oh, shit. Does anybody have a weapon?

01:23:52.904 --> 01:23:55.407
There's got to be
something around here.

01:24:10.255 --> 01:24:11.256
Ah!

01:24:13.174 --> 01:24:15.802
Every goddamn time! Ugh!

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:28.606
Now you decide to show up.

01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.130
<i>Evacuation fleet
moving to secondary location.</i>

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:53.631
Dude, you look like shit.

01:24:53.715 --> 01:24:54.955
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:56.134
I've been killing zombies all night.

01:24:56.217 --> 01:24:57.857
Yeah, you were kind of badass last night.

01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:00.889
Well, thanks for coming back.

01:25:00.972 --> 01:25:02.307
Somebody's got to keep saving your ass.

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:03.725
Yeah, I guess so.

01:25:04.392 --> 01:25:07.729
So, um, are we gonna
hang out after this, or...

01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:10.231
Come on, I feel like
the four of us are a team now.

01:25:10.315 --> 01:25:11.357
Relax, dude.

01:25:11.483 --> 01:25:13.985
You've got some business
to take care of right now.

01:25:18.281 --> 01:25:20.116
Go for it. You got this.

01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:23.036
- All right.
- Go.

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:30.627
I am so happy that you're okay.

01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:37.550
Oh, that's so sweet. Up top!

01:25:37.801 --> 01:25:39.385
Dude, I'm not high-fiving that.

01:25:39.469 --> 01:25:40.553
Come on.

01:25:40.637 --> 01:25:42.555
You think I'm high-fiving that?

01:25:42.639 --> 01:25:44.224
Come on!

01:25:44.641 --> 01:25:45.975
Aww, look at them!

01:25:50.188 --> 01:25:51.523
Who are you?

01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:53.358
I'm a Scout.

01:25:57.987 --> 01:25:59.030
All right, well, this just means

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.395
- I'm gonna fuck his mom.
- Hey!

01:26:00.448 --> 01:26:01.616
What?

01:28:26.844 --> 01:28:28.513
Come on.

01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:32.016
The end.
