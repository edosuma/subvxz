in cold blood.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.428
Smashed in the back of the head
with a blunt instrument.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
And then when he's laying on the floor

14:51.348 --> 14:52.725
and he's defenseless,

14:53.100 --> 14:54.143
and bleeding,

14:55.185 --> 14:56.186
and in pain,

14:58.188 --> 14:59.773
he's hit two more times.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.403
Two more times that will end his life.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.239
[Shana] There's a mandatory
six-month probationary period

15:07.323 --> 15:09.575
after a lackluster review like this.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.201
This is bullshit.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.121
I've been working nights.
Can't we just do this another time?

15:14.204 --> 15:18.208
Hey, Chels. Is it so hard to smile,
be nice and be punctual?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.293
I am.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.545
Look at all my last ten years
of reviews. I--

15:22.129 --> 15:23.797
This isn't accurate and you know it.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.841
I've never had
anything remotely like this.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.346
Russo's tanking my numbers
'cause of my brother.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.015
This trial's gonna be divided
into two parts.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.560
In the first part,
you're gonna hear all the evidence.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.104
And in the second part,

15:39.647 --> 15:41.231
you're gonna be asked to decide

15:41.690 --> 15:44.568
whether or not the defendant is eligible
for the death penalty.

15:46.487 --> 15:50.366
Fuck it. I'm through the first round for
a job at Memorial in Jacksonville anyway.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.202
You need a couple of personal days?

15:54.078 --> 15:55.955
You have them. Use them.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.165
Take a couple of days, hon.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.292
Go be with your brother.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.964
You're probably gonna hear
a lot of stories,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.257
fabricated by the defense.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.884
Oh, yeah.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.805
They're gonna throw a lot
of complicated theories and guesswork,

16:13.764 --> 16:14.974
some "what ifs" at you,

16:16.183 --> 16:17.768
but I'm gonna keep it real simple.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.479
Because, in fact, this case...

16:21.480 --> 16:22.439
is very simple.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.151
After texting

16:26.652 --> 16:30.364
Detective Marco Diaz 12 times

16:30.447 --> 16:31.865
in just two hours

16:32.825 --> 16:34.326
and using threatening language,

16:34.868 --> 16:37.871
after calling Detective Marco Diaz

16:38.372 --> 16:40.374
four times that same night,

16:41.125 --> 16:44.503
Eric O'Bannon marches over
to Marco Diaz's house,

16:44.878 --> 16:47.131
exchanges more heated words

16:48.590 --> 16:49.925
and kills the man.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.804
But, ladies and gentlemen,

16:54.430 --> 16:56.056
there is a chance for justice here.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.476
Because something very fortuitous
happened that night:

17:00.853 --> 17:01.854
A witness.

17:03.147 --> 17:07.901
A witness that could identify
Eric O'Bannon on sight.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.238
[Dr. Fred] You see these two black areas
at the end of each root?

17:11.822 --> 17:14.074
-Uh... yeah?
-They shouldn't be black.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.243
Uh, all right.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.786
What does that mean?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.664
If you're gonna keep the tooth,
you need a root canal.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.791
I can't have a root canal, Fred.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.960
There's two things I know cause this:

17:25.502 --> 17:27.921
Excess stress and cocaine use.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.549
Fuck.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.009
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:33.177 --> 17:35.554
one of Islamorada's finest...

17:36.680 --> 17:38.474
was murdered in his own home.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.392
Another man was shot.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.773
All so that this killer
could get away scot-free.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.651
Marco Diaz will never feel the sun again
on his face.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.237
He'll never have another Cuban coffee.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.281
He'll never have children.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.117
He'll never see his family or...

17:58.285 --> 17:59.953
talk to his lovely mother again.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.417
You have but one job in this courtroom

18:06.710 --> 18:07.920
in the next few days...

18:09.671 --> 18:15.219
and that is
to hold this defendant responsible

18:16.762 --> 18:17.971
for his actions.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.479
Thank you.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.694
[Sally] Father Lopez, I don't--
I don't know how to begin.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.696
It's very simple.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.952
You say what you have done
and through me, the Lord forgives you.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.412
That's it?

18:44.414 --> 18:46.166
Anything could be forgiven.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.551
Whenever you're ready.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.723
Yes, Eric O'Bannon has a criminal record
for petty crimes.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.226
And, yes, Eric O'Bannon is
a flawed human being.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.396
But Eric O'Bannon is not the brutal killer

19:07.479 --> 19:09.773
that the prosecution wants you to see,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.316
needs you to see.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.487
What?

19:17.072 --> 19:18.448
You can't be staring at me.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.950
You have to be looking at the--

19:26.540 --> 19:28.542
You're looking at me like I'm a magician

19:28.625 --> 19:31.044
and I'm gonna pull
a fucking rabbit out of my hat.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.462
What are you doing?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.966
Why are they doing this to me?

19:36.049 --> 19:38.135
This isn't about you
and the Rayburns anymore.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.305
It's about you and the 12 people
in that jury box.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.640
Get your head straight.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.227
And fix your fucking tie.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.604
You look like a mess.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.945
No, no, no. He said he can wait
to do the work till after the trial.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.866
But I'm on a strictly liquid diet
until further notice.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.786
I'm so sorry you're going
through this right now. Can you rest?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.289
[sighs] Yeah. I don't know.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.248
Fuck.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.416
Fuck.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.586
I can't believe
I have to deal with this shit now.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.546
It wasn't even hurting before.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.174
Now it hurts every time I even talk.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.761
-He hasn't even done anything yet.
-Did he give you anything?

20:20.844 --> 20:21.803
For the pain?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.431
Yeah, but he said
it would make me loopy.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.228
So, I can't take it
until after the fucking trial,

20:29.311 --> 20:30.729
'cause I have to testify.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.065
How's it going there?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.609
Marx is really good.
He just finished his opening.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.818
How's the jury?

20:36.902 --> 20:37.861
They're okay.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.280
-Okay like how?
-I don't know. They...

20:40.364 --> 20:42.157
seem like nice people, I guess.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.408
How many men?

20:43.492 --> 20:46.245
-Seven. And five women.
-Oh, good.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.996
Seven. Oh, that's good for me, then.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.332
Why? Why does that matter?

20:50.415 --> 20:51.583
I was thinking about it.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.294
Marco was really, you know,
a pretty good-looking guy, right?

20:54.378 --> 20:58.548
Women respond to that,
so it's better for me if there's more men.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.592
Um... listen, babe, I gotta go.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.761
But let me know
how it goes with Santos, okay?

21:02.844 --> 21:03.929
Okay. Love you.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.226
You just listened
to Mr. Marx's opening statement

21:10.060 --> 21:14.731
and though he mentioned
some supposed and unproven facts,

21:15.232 --> 21:18.151
most of his speech
was really about sympathy.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.445
And rightly so,

21:21.613 --> 21:23.031
because this is a tragedy,

21:23.573 --> 21:26.868
and we should all feel shocked
and saddened.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.914
And my heart goes out
to Marco Diaz's mother,

21:30.998 --> 21:32.165
and his brother,

21:32.499 --> 21:34.167
and his entire family,

21:34.751 --> 21:36.920
and all of his law enforcement colleagues.

21:37.921 --> 21:38.755
But...

21:39.298 --> 21:44.011
sympathy for the victim
should not cloud how you see this case.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.557
I'm going to ask you
to look carefully at the evidence,

21:48.640 --> 21:53.937
and I want you to pay
very close attention to the evidence,

21:54.730 --> 21:58.483
the evidence that will prove my client,

21:58.567 --> 22:01.111
Eric O'Bannon, committed no crime.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.800
Wow. Nice shooting.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.929
Christ, Eddie, don't my union fees
cover shave cream?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.558
Oh, shit, don't tell me you finally paid
your dues, you cheap fuck.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.893
-[chuckles]
-Kids good?

22:34.269 --> 22:35.103
Yeah.

22:36.063 --> 22:36.897
What's up?

22:36.980 --> 22:40.942
Now, the prosecution is gonna suggest
that Eric O'Bannon,

22:41.026 --> 22:43.862
on the verge of being offered
an immunity deal

22:43.945 --> 22:48.492
from the state's attorney
in regard to a potential investigation,

22:48.784 --> 22:50.994
decided to go on a killing spree.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.205
To attack Marco Diaz,

22:53.455 --> 22:56.917
a man for whom
Eric had no provable ill will,

22:57.417 --> 23:00.629
and then try to shoot
and kill Kevin Rayburn.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.882
Kevin Rayburn has known Eric
all of his life.

23:03.965 --> 23:08.512
Kevin Rayburn is the younger brother
of Eric's best

23:08.595 --> 23:09.805
and dearest friend.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.437
In all seriousness,
we want this squared up,

23:18.355 --> 23:20.023
keep morale high with a conviction.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.860
I understand that.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.029
So, when you on?

23:26.780 --> 23:27.906
Tomorrow, probably.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.450
Okay, well, keep me posted.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.244
Anything we can do for you.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.665
Sure you're okay?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.458
Oh, yeah.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.504
Good man, Eddie.

23:43.797 --> 23:44.631
Good luck!

23:52.389 --> 23:54.224
[gun cocks]

23:56.309 --> 23:57.978
During the course of this trial,

23:58.061 --> 24:00.605
I'm going to ask you to look

24:01.231 --> 24:03.024
at a powerful triangle

24:04.109 --> 24:08.196
of loyalty and influence and deception.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.533
Kevin Rayburn, a brother,

24:11.616 --> 24:14.244
who claims to be the only eyewitness.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.496
His older brother, John Rayburn,

24:17.164 --> 24:20.750
who's a detective who investigated
the crime scene.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.547
And their younger sister, Meg Rayburn,

24:26.256 --> 24:29.718
who is the ex-fiancée of Marco Diaz,

24:30.552 --> 24:34.306
who has a history
of violent outbursts towards Marco Diaz

24:34.598 --> 24:37.350
and whose DNA was found
at the crime scene.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.437
And who has disappeared into thin air.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.692
I'm gonna ask you to hold
these people in your mind,

24:45.775 --> 24:49.154
keep them front and center
and ask yourself:

24:50.197 --> 24:51.031
Why?

24:53.366 --> 24:58.163
Why would the Rayburns want
to frame Eric O'Bannon...

24:58.413 --> 24:59.998
[whispers] What are they talking about?

25:00.081 --> 25:05.045
...their lifetime childhood friend,
for the murder of Marco Diaz?

25:06.296 --> 25:09.633
Eric O'Bannon has a criminal record

25:10.342 --> 25:11.676
for petty crimes.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.972
Eric O'Bannon is a flawed human being.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.937
But Eric O'Bannon is not the brutal killer

25:23.104 --> 25:26.066
that the prosecution wants you to see.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.111
Needs you to see.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.197
[chiming]

25:34.574 --> 25:35.992
Hey. What can I do for you?

25:36.451 --> 25:37.786
[Ozzy] Well, it depends.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.913
-Are you Mr. Rayburn?
-Yes, I am.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.873
-Kevin Rayburn?
-Yep.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.874
Huh.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.751
Yeah.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.256
-You were a friend of my brother Danny's.
-Yeah. Yeah, man.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.507
-Awesome.
-I was, I was.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.052
Hey, um...

25:56.054 --> 25:58.431
Bro, I'm gonna be completely honest
with you, all right?

25:58.515 --> 25:59.474
[laughs]

25:59.557 --> 26:01.851
I'm, uh... I'm friends with Eric, too.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.396
Oh.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.313
[Ozzy] Yeah.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.857
What was your name again?

26:09.401 --> 26:12.112
[stammers] You know,
I've been talking to Eric.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
He's in really rough shape right now.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.285
And he just asked me to come over
and talk to you man to man,

26:18.743 --> 26:21.621
no bullshit, no lawyers,
and, you know, just-- Just--

26:22.289 --> 26:25.083
Okay, okay, here's--
Here's the thing. Yeah. All right?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.170
-He swears that he didn't shoot you.
-Listen.

26:29.254 --> 26:33.174
I'm gonna ask you to get the fuck off
my property right now, okay?

26:33.258 --> 26:34.968
He said he wasn't even there, bro.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.263
-I mean, I'm not calling you a liar, man.
-I didn't say you were.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.765
I don't got evidence either way, bro.
I got nothing.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.226
-I'm not gonna ask you twice. We're done.
-Come on.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.103
Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Just...

26:45.645 --> 26:47.605
Just hear me out, please.
Just hear me out.

26:50.608 --> 26:51.693
'Cause I see shit.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.154
I do.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.781
All the time now.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.286
And it's changed me.

27:01.619 --> 27:04.497
It's changed me. I'm not the same guy
I once was, and you know what?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.833
I just wanna help you change.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.463
I can't talk about this case.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.299
No, you don't have to talk about it.
How about that?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.510
Okay? I just want you
to think about it, that's it.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.387
Okay? That's all I ask, that you--

27:19.471 --> 27:22.307
-You get sober and see it for what it is.
-I'm sober.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.893
-Are you, though?
-Dude, I'm very fucking sober.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.394
Are you sober in your thoughts?

27:26.978 --> 27:27.812
Hm?

27:28.480 --> 27:31.941
Do you see it? What's your next move?
What's your next move? Huh?

27:32.567 --> 27:33.735
'Cause I'm sorry, but...

27:34.611 --> 27:37.322
-you're running out of time.
-What the fuck does that mean?

27:37.405 --> 27:38.907
-Are you threatening me?
-Oh, no.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.242
-Is that what's going on here?
-No, no, no, man.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.411
No, I'm not threatening you.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.038
I'm not, bro.

27:47.749 --> 27:48.792
You know what?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.211
You're-- You're actually threatening you.
Heh.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.004
'Cause I don't control this.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.299
This is just ticking,
I ain't got nothing to do with it.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.593
Just ticking. Ticktock, that's it.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.226
[door opens, then closes]

28:21.199 --> 28:22.033
It's late.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.452
I know. I'm sorry.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.039
Thanks for coming.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.544
Eric's falling apart.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.381
He's talking all kinds of shit, and I--

28:38.717 --> 28:41.052
He wanted me to call you.
You won't take his calls.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.012
And I wanna do right by him, you know?

28:46.683 --> 28:48.685
Isn't there anything you can do
to help him?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.687
Now?

28:52.522 --> 28:53.481
No, nothing.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.652
He seems to think that you're
intentionally trying to hurt him.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.696
I--

28:59.779 --> 29:02.073
I know you, John.
I told him you wouldn't do that.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.076
Will you just answer his call?

29:05.952 --> 29:08.204
Look, I-- I can't answer his calls.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.039
-You could explain yourself.
-Listen.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.167
You gotta understand,
I've got a job to do.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.837
And I do-- I'm gonna do my job.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.341
I have nothing against your brother.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.928
I'm gonna go on the stand,

29:24.345 --> 29:25.930
say what I saw at the crime scene.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.559
I'm gonna read my report, and that's all.

29:38.401 --> 29:39.527
Have you ever seen this?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.281
Found it in my mom's drawer.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.060
-They're young.
-Yeah.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.689
What happened to Danny's arm?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.651
[John] I don't know.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.822
Never seen this.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.366
You want it?

30:43.675 --> 30:45.552
No, Chelsea, I don't want it.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.099
I'm sorry. Thanks for coming.

30:54.602 --> 30:55.436
[engine starts]

30:55.520 --> 30:56.938
I don't know what else to do.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.150
Please, help him, John.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.081
You're not responsible
for your mother's actions, Nolan.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.083
I know, but you should take it.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.294
She stole from you...

31:19.961 --> 31:21.004
and I'd feel better.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.966
You know, pay your debts and all that.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.886
Well, thank you.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.430
Nolan, it's a very...

31:31.556 --> 31:33.641
honorable gesture, but...

31:35.727 --> 31:37.020
I can't accept it.

31:50.158 --> 31:50.992
You okay?

31:51.451 --> 31:52.744
Yeah. Yeah. I just...

31:54.245 --> 31:55.538
[sighs]

31:56.247 --> 31:57.957
feel like I missed out.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.126
On what?

32:00.209 --> 32:02.045
I don't know,
I get here and everything...

32:03.755 --> 32:04.756
falls apart.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.551
Nothing's falling apart, Nolan.

32:09.719 --> 32:10.887
We're all still here.

32:15.058 --> 32:15.892
In spirit,

32:17.226 --> 32:18.311
if not in body.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.106
You're not.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.486
We're not.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.618
People are gone, Sally.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.457
And anyone who's left is just kind of...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.168
[sighs]

32:42.835 --> 32:44.087
I don't know, messed up.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.173
Well...

32:48.675 --> 32:49.676
things'll work out.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.303
They always do.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.020
Told you.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.147
I fucking told you.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.524
I get it now.

33:05.108 --> 33:05.942
You're right.

33:06.067 --> 33:06.901
Yeah.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.277
Thank you.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.448
-Even John.
-Did you show him?

33:21.124 --> 33:22.083
They're all lying.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.259
Let's fuck them up.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.095
[cackling]

33:42.895 --> 33:44.522
What the fuck do you want?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.359
[Danny yells]

33:51.779 --> 33:53.865
[gasping]

33:55.408 --> 33:56.826
[cell phone rings]

34:01.164 --> 34:03.041
[ringing continues]

34:17.513 --> 34:18.347
Hello?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.183
Hey, John, it's Victoria Conte,

34:20.266 --> 34:22.977
calling to confirm you're up first
for us tomorrow, 10 a.m.

34:23.061 --> 34:23.895
Oh, yes.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.064
Any questions? Concerns?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.067
No. I'll see you in the morning.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.210
[laughing]
The fucking whole roof comes off.

34:47.293 --> 34:50.338
[Eric] Danny, I'm just saying
that your family, they just--

34:50.421 --> 34:53.007
They don't give
a fucking shit about you, man.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.635
Fuck your family,
fuck the fucking Rayburns.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.428
They hate you, man. They always will.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.847
-Jesus fucking Christ.
-[man] Hey.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.724
-[woman] Hey!
-[Eric] Okay, man.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.228
Okay, I'm-- I'm just trying to help, man.
I'm on your side.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.827
[shudders]

35:21.953 --> 35:23.538
[gavel striking]

35:23.621 --> 35:24.622
[Judge Reens] Raise your right hand.

35:24.705 --> 35:27.291
Do you swear or affirm that the testimony
which you're about to give

35:27.375 --> 35:29.877
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

35:29.961 --> 35:31.754
-so help you God?
-I do.

35:31.838 --> 35:32.922
Be seated.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.886
Please state your full name
and occupation.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.764
Jonathan Robert Rayburn.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.475
I'm a detective with the Monroe County
Sheriff's Department.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.478
And, Detective Rayburn,
have you and I met before today?

35:47.562 --> 35:48.521
Yes, ma'am.

35:48.896 --> 35:51.440
And have we talked
about this case before today?

35:52.066 --> 35:53.151
Yes, ma'am, we have.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.653
You and Mr. Marx have
both helped prepare me.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.655
And what did we tell you to say?

35:58.197 --> 36:00.074
You told me to tell the truth.

36:00.783 --> 36:01.617
[Victoria] Thank you.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.079
And you've been a police officer
for how long?

36:09.375 --> 36:10.626
Twenty-seven years.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.964
And in that time, you have received
a number of commendations for excellence.

36:15.047 --> 36:15.882
Is that correct?

36:17.925 --> 36:18.759
Yes, ma'am.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.179
If I could just read off the following:

36:21.262 --> 36:24.473
The Award of Valor,
the Chief's Special Award,

36:24.807 --> 36:28.936
seven different Awards of Commendation,
five Unit Citations,

36:29.020 --> 36:31.480
the Matthew Blickle
Community Service Award,

36:31.564 --> 36:34.734
and you were recognized
by the Florida Police Chiefs Association

36:34.817 --> 36:38.029
for exceptional achievement
and commitment to the public.

36:42.658 --> 36:43.534
Yes, ma'am.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.620
Quite an illustrious career.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.582
And over the course of your career,

36:49.665 --> 36:52.627
did there come a time
when you were involved in an investigation

36:52.710 --> 36:54.045
into the death of an officer

36:54.128 --> 36:57.757
of the Monroe County
Sheriff's Department named Marco Diaz?

37:00.718 --> 37:01.552
Yes, ma'am.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.222
And when and where
did you first become involved?

37:08.768 --> 37:11.979
I was notified at approximately 2:45 a.m.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.274
[Mia] And that night,
after you visited the crime scene,

37:15.858 --> 37:18.694
you went home,
you checked in with your family,

37:18.778 --> 37:22.782
you conferred with Sheriff Aguirre
on tactical plans,

37:23.324 --> 37:24.700
then you went to the hospital

37:24.784 --> 37:27.662
and you donated blood
to your brother, Kevin.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.249
But I'd like to go back to earlier
in the evening,

37:31.666 --> 37:34.252
between 8:30 and midnight.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.381
-Your cell phone gets 17 calls--
-Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.882
-[Judge Reens] Sustained.
-Your Honor--

37:39.966 --> 37:43.344
Not your witness, and Rayburn's
private phone calls are hardly relevant.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.471
I'm trying to establish the credibility--

37:45.554 --> 37:48.516
Who he talked to that night
doesn't materially affect his ability

37:48.599 --> 37:51.018
to see, hear or think
about the crime scene.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.270
[sighs]

37:53.145 --> 37:55.648
When was the last time you saw Eric?

37:56.816 --> 37:57.858
That would be, uh...

37:58.776 --> 38:02.738
three weeks...
prior to the night in question.

38:02.822 --> 38:06.033
Which would be the 23rd,
if I'm not mistaken.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.953
You didn't see him at 8 p.m.
the night of the murder?

38:10.371 --> 38:13.040
-No, ma'am.
-[Mia] Perhaps you're misremembering.

38:13.624 --> 38:17.920
Didn't you find Eric and handcuff him
and put a gun to his head?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.213
Objection, speculation.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.634
I'm trying to establish that John Rayburn
has a historical bias towards my client.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.178
I'd like to show how it applies
to the night in question.

38:26.262 --> 38:29.765
Your Honor, Detective Rayburn is
an honorable police officer.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.018
-I trust we're getting there, counselor.
-[Mia] In fact,

38:32.101 --> 38:35.104
didn't you find Eric
a few days later on the 19th

38:35.187 --> 38:38.232
and offer him a gun
and other gear to protect himself?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.234
Objection, Your Honor. Speculation.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.819
Overruled. Answer the question.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.738
-[Brandon] Your Honor--
-Answer the question.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.781
No, ma'am.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.827
You were at the crime scene
and the gun disappeared.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.580
And then you visited Eric on the 19th?

38:53.247 --> 38:55.624
-No, ma'am.
-But didn't he end up with the gun?

38:55.708 --> 38:59.128
Yes, but I can assure you that had nothing
to do with any of my actions.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.963
-[Brandon] Your Honor--
-[gavel striking]

39:01.047 --> 39:02.840
[Judge Reens]
Counselors, please approach the bench.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.816
[door opens]

39:21.359 --> 39:22.193
[Lenny] Hi, John.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.708
You know why I came down here...

39:38.542 --> 39:40.336
in the first place, started my career?

39:42.630 --> 39:47.134
I always thought I'd be somebody
that left things better than I found them.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.679
I'm a small-town guy, always had been.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.515
Not meant for the big stage.

39:53.307 --> 39:56.852
And I thought that I could do it here,
have an impact.

39:58.604 --> 40:02.066
You get a certain age, and, you know...

40:03.025 --> 40:06.404
you start thinking about how you did,
how you're leaving things.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.197
And I did some good, sure,

40:08.280 --> 40:11.826
but in my second year on the force,
I did something wrong.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.285
Real wrong.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.999
Swallowing your family's lie about Danny,
no, that wasn't it.

40:21.043 --> 40:24.088
No, this was... irreversible.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.678
And not long after, a few months,
I got a chance to make it right.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.055
To come clean, fix it.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.183
I didn't do it.

40:37.893 --> 40:40.187
Now I'm an old man,

40:41.439 --> 40:42.356
milling around,

40:42.440 --> 40:46.569
trying to patch up a million
little mistakes that are long gone,

40:46.652 --> 40:52.741
meaningless, all because I didn't do
the one thing when I had the chance.

40:55.744 --> 40:59.290
I don't know
what in hell is going on here,

41:00.207 --> 41:01.834
but I've got a pretty good guess.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.544
And if I'm right,

41:04.378 --> 41:06.338
this is your one chance.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.641
[Mia] And by 3:10 a.m.,
you entered the crime scene.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.684
Is that correct?

41:19.727 --> 41:22.771
That's accurate. It is all detailed
in the crime scene logs.

41:23.063 --> 41:26.734
Yes, you've offered your professional
assessment of the crime scene, Detective.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.486
But I'm just wondering,

41:29.111 --> 41:31.155
why were you there in the first place?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.116
I was one of the responding officers.

41:34.200 --> 41:38.370
But wasn't it a breach
of investigation protocol

41:38.454 --> 41:40.831
for you to have been admitted early
to a crime scene

41:40.915 --> 41:42.666
where your brother had been shot?

41:43.292 --> 41:45.336
No, ma'am, I was doing my job.

41:45.419 --> 41:47.963
And what exactly was the job
that you were doing?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.884
Investigating, looking for leads.

41:52.259 --> 41:55.095
Did you find Detective Diaz's gun
at the scene?

41:56.430 --> 41:57.264
No, ma'am.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.017
Are you sure?
Did you look everywhere for it?

42:00.601 --> 42:02.186
It was not in its holster.

42:02.269 --> 42:03.562
Was it under the bed?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.649
-I don't know.
-Did you check under the bed?

42:07.191 --> 42:08.859
-No, ma'am.
-Was it in the bathroom?

42:09.068 --> 42:10.152
I don't know.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.947
We don't need to go through
every square inch of the house.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.031
Get to the point.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.909
Well, as we've seen in Exhibit 3,

42:16.992 --> 42:20.037
no gun was found at the scene...

42:20.746 --> 42:25.834
after the crime scene investigators
finished their report at 4:45 a.m.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.420
What time did you leave the scene,
Detective?

42:29.004 --> 42:31.465
That would have been approximately 3:20.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.301
So, you were there
for less than ten minutes.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.097
Yes, ma'am.
Again, it's all detailed in the reports.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.848
I was there seven minutes total.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.601
And did anybody go
into the house with you?

42:43.852 --> 42:44.687
No, ma'am.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.939
But you had been there before.

42:48.524 --> 42:52.069
Detective Diaz and I were partners
and friends foremost.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.862
Yes, ma'am,
I'd been there many times.

42:53.946 --> 42:57.324
So, you did a sweep of the house alone,

42:57.908 --> 43:01.245
between 3:10 and 3:17 a.m.,

43:01.620 --> 43:06.250
before there was a record of what was
and was not present at the scene.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.170
I did not conduct a sweep.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.006
Did you touch anything?

43:12.089 --> 43:12.923
No, ma'am.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.426
[Mia] You didn't take anything?

43:18.512 --> 43:20.514
-No, ma'am.
-[Mia] Could you have?

43:21.015 --> 43:21.849
[John] Ma'am?

43:22.683 --> 43:28.355
Did you have the time and the privacy
to put a gun in your pocket, for example?

43:32.568 --> 43:34.069
Yes, ma'am, I suppose so.

43:34.528 --> 43:37.573
Did anybody search you
when you left Marco Diaz's house?

43:38.949 --> 43:39.783
No, ma'am.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.744
So, to be clear,

43:42.369 --> 43:46.540
you were alone in the crime scene
for roughly seven minutes...

43:47.333 --> 43:50.419
and nobody searched you
when you left the house?

43:51.003 --> 43:51.962
That is correct.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.965
What were you doing in there,
Detective Rayburn?

43:57.343 --> 43:58.844
Well, as I said, I was, uh--

44:00.137 --> 44:01.513
I was looking for leads.

44:01.972 --> 44:02.890
I was--

44:04.767 --> 44:05.601
I--

44:12.524 --> 44:14.276
I was saying goodbye to a friend.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.989
Did any of these leads lead you to believe

44:19.073 --> 44:21.408
that Eric O'Bannon
had committed this crime?

44:22.493 --> 44:23.619
-No, ma'am.
-No.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.664
And as we've seen in Exhibit 5,

44:27.247 --> 44:29.917
no other suspect was ever even considered.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.294
Why was that, Detective Rayburn?

44:32.378 --> 44:34.296
It's because we had an eyewitness.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.048
And who was that eyewitness?

44:37.216 --> 44:38.050
Kevin Rayburn.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.052
And do you know Kevin Rayburn?

44:40.135 --> 44:42.554
-Yes, ma'am.
-How do you know Kevin Rayburn?

44:43.138 --> 44:44.556
Kevin Rayburn is my brother.

44:45.808 --> 44:49.603
So, other than your brother's
personal opinion,

44:50.187 --> 44:53.482
was there any other reason
to suspect that Eric had done this?

45:04.535 --> 45:05.786
Yes, ma'am.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.163
Yes?

45:09.498 --> 45:10.332
Yes, ma'am.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.461
And what was that, in your opinion?

45:22.469 --> 45:23.303
Marco--

45:25.431 --> 45:29.101
I'm sorry,
Detective Diaz had mentioned to me

45:29.184 --> 45:32.771
that he was going
to rescind Eric O'Bannon's immunity deal

45:33.105 --> 45:36.108
because he thought that Eric had something
to do with my brother's death

45:36.191 --> 45:38.777
-and may have even killed my brother.
-That's bullshit.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.071
-Danny was my best friend! John!
-[Judge Reens] Order.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.199
You know that. I didn't do anything!

45:44.283 --> 45:47.369
-You are in contempt.
-[Eric] Please, John, don't do this to me!

45:47.453 --> 45:50.330
-John, why are you doing this to me?
-[Mia] Eric, stop. Stop!

45:50.414 --> 45:51.748
-[Eric] John, don't do this!
-[Judge Reens] Recess.

45:51.832 --> 45:55.127
-Recess until O'Bannon controls himself.
-Why are you doing this to me?

45:55.210 --> 45:56.712
Please, John!

46:00.716 --> 46:02.050
[John] When is this gonna end?

46:03.552 --> 46:05.554
[panting]

46:12.269 --> 46:15.522
[Sally]
I think my family's cursed, Father Lopez.

46:17.691 --> 46:18.734
I'm sorry, Sally.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.069
If you're not taking this seriously--

46:21.153 --> 46:23.238
You don't have children.
You can't understand.

46:27.826 --> 46:28.660
[sobbing] Sometimes...

46:30.329 --> 46:31.413
I hate them.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.751
You know who God is?

46:38.378 --> 46:41.715
A parent with insanely violent
and destructive children.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.178
What do I do?

46:48.847 --> 46:50.265
I can tell you that...

46:54.520 --> 46:56.104
he had two choices:

46:58.065 --> 46:59.358
Destroy them, or...

47:01.109 --> 47:02.277
or die for them.

47:07.699 --> 47:09.618
[Victoria]
Will you please state your full name?

47:10.410 --> 47:12.079
Chelsea Catherine O'Bannon.

47:12.538 --> 47:14.540
Have you ever had your deposition taken?

47:15.332 --> 47:16.208
No, ma'am.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.418
Okay. Let's go over ground rules.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.965
[cell phone ringing]

47:31.974 --> 47:32.808
Rayburn.

47:32.891 --> 47:36.228
-[woman] You have a collect call from...
-Eric O'Bannon.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.231
[woman]
...at the Monroe County Detention Center.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.108
Will you accept the charges?

47:41.191 --> 47:42.651
[line disconnects]

47:50.909 --> 47:51.868
[Brandon] All right.

47:51.952 --> 47:55.789
So, you're at the bar,
you're drinking with Meg Rayburn

47:56.456 --> 47:57.374
until what time?

47:57.916 --> 48:00.127
-Eleven thirty.
-And then what happens?

48:02.296 --> 48:04.214
She was telling me for half an hour,

48:06.258 --> 48:07.426
saying things like:

48:08.885 --> 48:10.304
"I'm gonna go fix this shit."

48:11.138 --> 48:12.347
[Brandon] She was saying "like"?

48:12.431 --> 48:13.557
That's what she said.

48:13.974 --> 48:17.185
Did she say specifically
what she meant by "this shit"?

48:19.062 --> 48:20.022
Marco Diaz.

48:22.065 --> 48:23.317
She was gonna fix Marco.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.652
And how do you know that?

48:26.612 --> 48:27.613
I drove her there.

48:28.572 --> 48:29.698
Where?

48:29.948 --> 48:31.408
To Marco Diaz's house.

48:31.491 --> 48:34.578
-Why wouldn't you reveal that till now?
-I didn't wanna get involved.

48:34.661 --> 48:35.495
Why not?

48:36.580 --> 48:37.873
I feared for my safety.

48:38.957 --> 48:40.167
My personal safety.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.127
You feared for it?

48:42.711 --> 48:43.545
Yes.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.299
Well, Miss O'Bannon,

48:48.091 --> 48:49.635
what are you so afraid of?

48:53.096 --> 48:54.640
Miss O'Bannon, answer the question.

49:02.648 --> 49:04.483
What exactly are you afraid of?

49:06.318 --> 49:07.486
The Rayburns.

49:08.236 --> 49:09.488
And what they'd do to me.
