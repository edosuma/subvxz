01:23.751 --> 01:28.297
Ford, Carter, Reagan,
Bush, Clinton...

01:28.381 --> 01:30.132
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I don't know.

01:30.216 --> 01:33.719
Come on, Clinton was the fun one,
then came the boring one.

01:33.803 --> 01:34.845
<i>They're all boring.</i>

01:34.929 --> 01:36.347
Whoa.

01:36.514 --> 01:37.390
Sounded close.

01:37.473 --> 01:38.474
Yeah. We're in for it.

01:51.821 --> 01:52.821
Gotta go, Max.

02:20.683 --> 02:21.726
Are you all right?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.312
We're fine. Thank you for your help.

02:24.729 --> 02:25.730
We can take it from here.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.583
Ten short-essay questions.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.917
You have 30 minutes.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.837
I suggest you not linger
on any one of them.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.005
Who's the boring one?

02:51.380 --> 02:52.380
Quiet.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.847
You have to help me.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.850
I don't wanna go. I refuse to go.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.769
- Please help me.
- What?

03:05.269 --> 03:06.937
Please, I don't wanna go.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.105
Please help me.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.315
I don't understand.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.274
Mr. McGinnis,

03:10.358 --> 03:11.984
what don't you understand?

03:12.735 --> 03:14.403
Uh, nothing. Sorry.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.954
Please, you have to help me.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.497
I don't wanna go.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.249
I refuse to go.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.293
Please help me. Please.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.390
Please, you have to help me.

03:42.807 --> 03:43.807
I don't wanna go.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.685
I refuse to 90. Please help me. Please.

03:52.108 --> 03:55.111
"Help me. Help me."
Over and over again, like a broken disk.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.529
And then she vanishes.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.612
Yeah.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.083
Guess what.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.166
She's here.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.878
Yep. Right there, asking for help again.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.046
Talk to her.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.297
Who are you?

04:17.550 --> 04:18.384
Tamara.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.552
What are you doing here?

04:20.636 --> 04:21.554
I need your help.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.056
Yeah. I got that. So where are you?

04:34.316 --> 04:35.401
Jeez.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.069
What do you see?

04:37.153 --> 04:39.029
Not you, or the mutt.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.383
It looks like a living room,
real swanked out.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.968
Her parents are over there on the phone.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.410
<i>Can you ID the place?</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:45.493
Yeah.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.703
On the pillows.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.747
She's doing it again.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.749
You're calling again, aren't you?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.381
Who are you calling?

04:58.424 --> 04:59.842
Tell me. Now!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.472
Whoa.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.265
- What happened?
- Daddy's mad.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.766
What was on the pillows?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.977
Letters. G-P-T.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.480
Gotham Park Towers.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.778
I'm glad you could come.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.448
Makes me look a little less conspicuous.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.531
Right.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.329
I've never seen you
in a dress before.

05:28.621 --> 05:29.538
You look good.

05:29.622 --> 05:32.750
I only make this sacrifice
for lobster thermidor.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.210
This is on the boss man?

05:34.293 --> 05:35.211
Every bite.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.712
Schway.

05:39.465 --> 05:40.465
That's her.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.516
<i>Any messages for 1884?</i>

05:48.891 --> 05:49.891
No, <i>ma'am.</i>

05:54.813 --> 05:55.856
Save me some dessert.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.266
- [They know! Look out!
198893]

07:47.509 --> 07:49.178
I can't even make out their faces.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.387
You don't have to.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.598
Your subconscious will see her
if she's there.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.016
Just try not to blink.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.144
I can't believe
all these kids are missing.

07:57.853 --> 07:58.853
Believe it.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.067
Yeah, that's her.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.444
Tamara Caulder.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.404
Reported missing yesterday.

08:07.488 --> 08:11.116
Address, 2014 Riverside, apartment 33.

08:31.387 --> 08:32.387
What the...

08:34.056 --> 08:36.225
Easy, I'm not here to make trouble.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.643
I've been talking to your girl.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.482
We're not rich people,
and raising Tamara has been tough.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.526
She isn't like other kids.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.236
But I guess you know that.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.238
When they told us
about their special school,

08:49.321 --> 08:50.781
it was like a godsend.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.242
Finally, she could get
the help she needed.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.410
Right after they took her,

08:54.493 --> 08:57.371
Joyce realized that she forgot
to pack her favorite toy.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.250
I called them up right there and then,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.085
but no one answered.

09:04.128 --> 09:07.965
None of the numbers!
It was all bogus, the whole school!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.508
Where have they taken her?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.009
Where is my girl?

09:11.093 --> 09:12.970
I'm trying to find that out,
Mrs. Caulder.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.722
Is there anything else you can tell me?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.097
Anything at all?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.559
Well, I heard the woman on the phone.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.185
She didn't know I was listening.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.439
She kept talking about the Brain Trust
like it was something important.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.773
"The Brain Trust."

09:24.857 --> 09:27.192
Tell me,
where was this school they showed you?

09:36.994 --> 09:39.329
Yeah, there are desks,
but just on this floor.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.999
And all the computers
are just empty frames.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.377
It was made to look like a school.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.337
Any luck on the Brain Trust?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.715
It's an international society.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.215
Very secretive.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.052
Headquarters are somewhere
in Europe, they think.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.012
<i>That's it?</i>

09:55.095 --> 09:56.638
I'm still talking to INTERPOL.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.600
But it's fairly evident
what the Brain Trust is about

09:59.683 --> 10:01.018
just by its name.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.187
There was nothing brainy
about the guy in the hotel.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.189
Oh, no? Think about it.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.941
He was invulnerable, and felt no pain,

10:08.025 --> 10:10.027
<i>like shamans who walk on hot coals.</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:11.236
<i>It's mind over matter.</i>

10:11.320 --> 10:13.197
I hate it when you blitz me like that.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.948
<i>Just see What you can find.</i>

10:21.497 --> 10:22.497
You.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.749
Looks like school's out.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.084
Maybe you can tell me what's going on.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.604
It's crashing me down, Max.
Where could she be?

13:32.688 --> 13:34.856
Grip yourself, Ter.
What about the fat man?

13:34.940 --> 13:35.941
What'd he have to say?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.442
They took him down to county.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.671
I don't think he's gonna be
forming sentences for a while.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.113
If she'd only contact me.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.948
<i>Maybe she's not here anymore.</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:45.325
No. She's in Gotham somewhere.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.244
Don't ask me how I know. I just do.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.037
I can feel it.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.665
Hey, I believe anything on this case.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.710
Ooh. Time to reveal
the new more natural me.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
I'll call you later.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.506
Speak to me.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.969
<i>I have</i> to <i>Whisper.</i>

14:05.637 --> 14:07.347
Tamara, is that you?

14:07.431 --> 14:09.349
<i>Shh. We have to be quiet.</i>

14:09.725 --> 14:10.726
<i>They can hear.</i>

14:11.143 --> 14:12.144
Are you all right?

14:12.227 --> 14:15.105
<i>Yes, but you've gotta find me.
We're leaving tonight.</i>

14:15.188 --> 14:16.857
- Where are you?
- In <i>a boat.</i>

14:16.940 --> 14:19.067
- Where's the boat?
- In the <i>water.</i>

14:19.151 --> 14:20.193
Where in the water?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.194
<i>I don't know!</i>

14:21.278 --> 14:23.071
Okay, okay. Don't get upset.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.323
Is there anything you see
that can help me?

14:25.615 --> 14:27.492
Like the name of the boat, anything?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
Tamara!

15:02.235 --> 15:03.445
I'd eat if I were you.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.989
There aren't any snacks on this cruise.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.545
Any word from Edgar?

15:20.629 --> 15:21.505
Not yet.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.748
Something must've gone wrong.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.174
Batman got him.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.677
Tell the captain I want to leave now.
No more delays.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.519
<i>I don't expect you
to understand,</i>

15:35.602 --> 15:37.479
<i>but we have your best interest in mind.</i>

15:37.854 --> 15:40.273
You're a gifted girl, Tamara,
just like me.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.947
While others can only
tap into 10% of their brains,

15:47.030 --> 15:48.198
we can go deeper.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.367
It's what separates us from them.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.744
The Brain Trust will make you see that.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.081
Together, people like us
will change the world.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.582
I don't wanna change the world.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.126
I want my mommy and daddy.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.384
Don't even think of trying to call him.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.386
It would be useless at this point.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.721
Remember, we can hear you, too.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.157
I knew you'd find me.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.244
Yeah, well, your mom was worried
you'd be missing this.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.327
Pugley!

16:39.207 --> 16:40.207
Come on.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.712
By the way,
what's the creepy lady's power?

16:43.795 --> 16:46.006
I don't know,
but they call her "Bombshell."

16:46.089 --> 16:47.424
Oh, that's encouraging.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.027
Keep going. I'll take care of them.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.654
- Go.
- Give her up, Batman.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.282
She doesn't belong to your kind.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.795
It was a trick. He doesn't have her.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.631
We'll take care of him first.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.595
One down.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.063
I'm impressed, Batman.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.565
That would've taken out
a small infantry.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.151
Of course,
there's nothing like a direct hit.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.402
No.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.823
Oh...

19:18.658 --> 19:19.826
Where are you?

19:47.145 --> 19:50.273
I love it. Ghost girl
ends up saving your butt.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.109
I'd call it
a mutual butt-saving situation.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.069
Whatever.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.945
Actually, it turned out pretty good.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.132
Tamara and her parents
were put under protective custody.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.675
Not only do they end up
in a better place,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.701
but they got doctors
to help her with her powers.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.203
You think she's doing okay?

20:03.286 --> 20:04.286
Oh, yeah.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.291
I've got a feeling
she's doing just fine.
