WEBVTT

00:19.052 --> 00:21.120
We think you should
repopulate with Melissa.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.888
And you're okay with this?

00:22.890 --> 00:25.124
This is for
repopulation purposes only.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.892
MELISSA:
This is all so romantic.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.694
Let's just cut the BS
and get to it.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.863
I just have one more thing.
Phil, come on.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.832
PHIL:
<i>Now it's time for the real</i>

00:33.834 --> 00:35.934
fireworks.
Do you hear something?

00:37.337 --> 00:39.505
What the hell?
Hey.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.273
I'm Todd.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.643
This is so crazy. Hi.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.512
I-I'm Melissa.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.481
This is Phil.
Hey, Todd.
(short chuckle)

00:49.483 --> 00:51.083
I can't believe I'm seeing you.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.185
I mean, I'd just given up on
looking for people, was headed

00:53.187 --> 00:55.054
to the next town
when I-I saw your fireworks.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.522
Phil set those off.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.856
Oh, God
bless you, Phil.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.992
I mean, if you hadn't
set those things off,

00:59.994 --> 01:01.593
I'd be halfway to Mexico

01:01.595 --> 01:03.562
by now.
Yeah, thank God

01:03.564 --> 01:06.565
I shot off those frigging
fireworks, huh?
I know. I was this close

01:06.567 --> 01:09.568
to driving to the next town.
This close, I... So close.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.836
Yeah, we're aware
of the timeline.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.171
That's been established.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.272
So you need directions
or something?

01:13.274 --> 01:14.540
Or, uh...

01:14.542 --> 01:16.909
Oh, my goodness, I am so sorry.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.878
I hope I... I wasn't
interrupting anything or...

01:19.880 --> 01:22.114
Oh, no, you-you weren't.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.049
Well, I mean.
D... What...

01:24.051 --> 01:25.784
Todd, give us a
quick sec, okay?

01:25.786 --> 01:26.919
Yeah, of course.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.887
Hey. I don't want to be rude,

01:28.889 --> 01:31.190
but this sex
is pretty time sensitive.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.358
Okay? So we really
got to buckle down here.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.793
And remember,
this lovemaking

01:34.795 --> 01:36.361
is to save the human race.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.630
And that's a big deal.
Phil, another person
just showed up.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.532
Wow, check out
this setup, huh?

01:40.534 --> 01:41.733
Oh, no, no, no,
don't touch that.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.036
(power chord plays)

01:44.038 --> 01:47.573
PHIL (over P.A.): That orgasm
was generously provided by

01:47.575 --> 01:49.875
Phil Miller.
(Todd chuckles)

01:49.877 --> 01:51.643
Sorry.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.450
(generator humming)

02:03.790 --> 02:05.557
Carol.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.925
Turn that stuff off.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.193
Okay.

02:10.897 --> 02:14.066
Phil, you're back so soon.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.235
Thank you for keeping
it expedient.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.503
Well, it didn't happen.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.772
Oh, you have diarrhea?
No.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.574
Melissa has diarrhea?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.143
No, Carol, nobody has diarrhea.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.344
Okay?
Another guy

02:25.346 --> 02:26.945
just showed up out of nowhere.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.815
What? Another person?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.750
Yeah, some friggin'
fat dude named Todd.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.252
Oh, my God.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.087
This is the best news.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.089
Melissa can repopulate
with him now and our babies

02:37.091 --> 02:38.924
won't have to have sex
with each other.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.593
Well, we're not
out of the water just yet.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.362
Why are we still in the water?

02:43.364 --> 02:46.365
Well, I just have a real hunch
that Melissa would way prefer

02:46.367 --> 02:49.268
to have sex with me
over this Todd character.
Phil, the only

02:49.270 --> 02:51.937
reason we entered into
this unholy Watusi

02:51.939 --> 02:53.605
was to spread out the gene pool.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.774
Carol, shame on you.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.843
We can't just force Melissa
to have sex with

02:57.845 --> 03:00.679
some stranger. I mean,
that's called human trafficking.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.781
Now, she has
a constitutional right

03:02.783 --> 03:04.616
to choose her own
sexual partners, okay?

03:04.618 --> 03:08.220
This isn't Russia here.
This is the friggin' USA. Mm?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.956
Phil, are you really concerned
with Melissa's rights?

03:10.958 --> 03:13.692
Or are you just trying to
justify having sex with her?

03:15.361 --> 03:16.862
Yes.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.997
Yes to which one?

03:18.999 --> 03:21.800
Oh, to the one that makes you
happy. You know the one.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.503
Okay, good.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.138
Well, I want to meet him.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.040
Ugh, but I can't wear this.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.142
And all my clothes
are still wet.

03:30.144 --> 03:33.879
Oh, I do have one
thing that's dry.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.514
So what brings
you to Tucson,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.683
Todd?
Oh, you know,
actually,

03:37.685 --> 03:40.319
I was on my way to Zihuatanejo
from Baltimore when

03:40.321 --> 03:43.388
I saw Phil's
"Alive in Tucson" billboard.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.158
Why were you going
to Zihuatanejo?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.760
I... I-I got the idea from...

03:48.762 --> 03:50.429
uh, <i>The Shawshank Redemption.</i>

03:50.431 --> 03:52.998
Oh my God, that's...
that's my favorite movie.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.666
No, it's my favorite
movie, too.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.335
MELISSA: I've seen it,
like, a hundred times.
Melissa.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.836
It's just one of those movies
if you turn on the TV

03:57.838 --> 03:59.171
Melissa. Melissa.
and it happens
to be on, you just...

03:59.173 --> 04:00.839
just have to finish it.
You have to finish it.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.041
Melissa, Melissa.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.943
It's my favorite movie, too.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.712
Big Shankhead here.
(chuckles)

04:06.714 --> 04:07.913
I thought
you said

04:07.915 --> 04:09.881
your favorite movie
was <i>The Godfather.</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:11.450
Carol, are you high?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.685
<i>The Godfather</i> is crap
next to <i>Shawshank.</i>

04:13.687 --> 04:16.054
Oh.
Yes, Tom Hanks
at his finest, right?

04:16.056 --> 04:18.857
Tom Hanks?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.892
What's your favorite
part of <i>Shawshank,</i> Phil?

04:20.894 --> 04:24.196
(chuckles) Uh...

04:24.198 --> 04:26.198
There's so many parts.
So many parts to...

04:26.200 --> 04:27.766
choose from and to pick from.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.603
Uh, probably,
you know, the-the part

04:31.605 --> 04:34.573
where the Shawshank
is redeemed.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.475
'Cause, like,
you know,

04:36.477 --> 04:38.644
Hanks does some...

04:38.646 --> 04:40.112
Well, I've
never seen it.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.913
Well, I'm...
You-You got to see it.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.216
You know? As they say
in the movie, get busy livin'

04:44.218 --> 04:45.284
or get busy...
Get busy dyin'.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.487
Dyin'. Yeah.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.556
It truly was
a Shawshank redemption.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.231
So, uh, Todd,
what are you, uh, like,

04:59.233 --> 05:01.400
uh, three hundo? Two fiddy?
(gasps)

05:01.402 --> 05:02.501
Phil.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.902
What? What?
I got... It's...

05:03.904 --> 05:04.936
I'm just curious.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.972
Hey, guys, it's okay.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.240
I've been overweight
my whole life.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.575
See?
Both... Yeah, my

05:10.577 --> 05:12.944
parents died
when I was really young,

05:12.946 --> 05:14.780
so I kind of turned
to food for comfort.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.848
Oh.
(sighs)

05:16.850 --> 05:19.251
Kids were so mean, you know?

05:19.253 --> 05:20.519
I-I got teased a lot.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.155
Then, my senior year,

05:23.157 --> 05:25.424
I actually got voted
Homecoming King.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.426
All I could think
was, you know,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.594
if only...

05:29.596 --> 05:31.596
my mom and dad
could see me now.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.532
And, uh... anyways,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.167
the night of the dance comes,

05:35.169 --> 05:37.336
and they lead me onstage
for the coronation.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.972
And I'm just beaming,
you know?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.141
And then they
brought out my queen.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.877
Actually, they
led her out on a leash,

05:45.879 --> 05:48.680
'cause my queen was
a barnyard pig wearing a tiara.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.117
Oh.
It was all just a...

05:52.119 --> 05:54.119
a big joke.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.957
Uh, but in answer
to your question, I'm 285.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.993
(whispers):
Thank you.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.462
Guess what, Todd.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.963
All those kids
from your high school,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.465
they're all dead now.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.134
(laughs)
So screw 'em, right?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.203
Cheers to that.
They can lick a duck,

06:11.205 --> 06:12.471
Todd.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.806
Hey, Todd...

06:14.808 --> 06:16.875
They can't hurt you anymore.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.846
(quietly):
Yeah.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.482
Well, it's...
it's been a big day.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.484
I should... I should
probably get to bed.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.852
Yeah.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.020
Hey, hey,
you know what? I...

06:29.022 --> 06:31.390
I'm so happy to be here.
I mean, I just can't wait

06:31.392 --> 06:33.425
to get to know you better.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.761
Good night.
Good night.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.095
Good night.
Good night.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.732
What a great guy.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.735
I ever told you guys that I had
a little weight problem

06:43.737 --> 06:44.836
myself in high school?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.872
No.
Yeah. And
so when Todd

06:46.874 --> 06:50.575
told those stories, it stirred
up a lot of old gunk in me.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.577
All right,

06:52.579 --> 06:54.045
I'm gonna hit it, too, guys.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.614
You want to stick around
and play

06:55.616 --> 06:56.882
a little Cranium
or something?

06:56.884 --> 06:59.251
No.
I'm afraid I insist.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.421
All right, then. Good night.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.256
Ah.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.924
Wow.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.193
That was like a
welding factory.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.895
Did you see all
those sparks?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.898
(softly chuckling)

07:12.900 --> 07:14.966
Mm.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.077
Oh, Carol Pilbasian Miller,

07:26.079 --> 07:27.913
you are one crafty devil.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.481
PHIL:
Carol?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.050
What's this?

07:32.052 --> 07:35.120
Oh, just a little nudge
for Melissa and Todd.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.254
I'm setting it up

07:36.256 --> 07:38.390
so they think the four of us

07:38.392 --> 07:39.891
are going on an outing,

07:39.893 --> 07:42.060
but you and I
are gonna back out

07:42.062 --> 07:43.295
last second.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.897
Carol, this is a complete
waste of glitter.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.065
Okay? Melissa

07:47.067 --> 07:48.500
would never go for Todd.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.902
I mean, she's beautiful
and smart

07:50.904 --> 07:53.104
and kind and he's...

07:53.106 --> 07:54.639
Todd.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.476
I don't know. I think they're
more alike than you think.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.911
I mean, they had that whole
favorite movie in common.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.413
Oh, please, Carol,

08:01.415 --> 08:04.149
love runs deeper than just
sharing a favorite movie.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.218
(scoffs)

08:09.755 --> 08:11.122
(knocking)

08:11.124 --> 08:12.991
Hey.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.493
What's up, Phil?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.661
Oh, just gettin' busy livin'.
(chuckles)

08:16.663 --> 08:17.696
I still can't believe
that <i>Shawshank's</i>

08:17.698 --> 08:18.997
your favorite movie, too.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.765
Uh, what a cool thing
to have in common.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.301
Yeah, I guess. Though it's a lot
of people's favorite movie.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.103
Yeah, I was actually thinking
about my favorite

08:25.105 --> 08:26.605
<i>Shawshank</i> quote this morning.
You want to hear it?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.440
Yeah.
Okay,

08:28.442 --> 08:31.776
this is Red, as played
by actor Morgan Freeman.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.613
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant

08:34.615 --> 08:37.849
to be caged. Their feathers
are just too bright.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.351
(mouths)

08:39.353 --> 08:40.685
Wow, that was...

08:40.687 --> 08:42.854
And when they fly away,
the part of you that, uh,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.990
knows it was a sin
to lock them up

08:44.992 --> 08:47.792
does rejoice.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.061
Huh? Yeah.
That was really great.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.564
Oh, my God, how about last night
when I said that Tom Hanks

08:52.566 --> 08:54.633
was in <i>Shawshank</i>
<i>and you totally fell for it?</i>

08:54.635 --> 08:56.167
You should have seen
the look on your face.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.470
You were like, what
is this guy talking about?

08:58.472 --> 09:00.972
(laughs)
Well, no, I just thought
you hadn't seen the movie

09:00.974 --> 09:02.541
and were pretending
like you had.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.844
Classic. If I hadn't seen it,
would I have known that

09:05.846 --> 09:08.079
Richard Francis-Bruce
edited the dang thing?

09:08.081 --> 09:10.815
Or that, uh, Ken Magee
played Ned Grimes? Oh, geez.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.752
What's going on here? You got a
bunch of Post-it notes up here.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.221
That's crazy. How'd you guys get
up there? No, no, no, I got 'em.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.224
(laughs) Well, I'm gonna get
these and get out of your hair.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.725
Your hair's looking nice,
by the way.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.193
Uh, quick question.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.329
Is now a good time
to talk about repopulation?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.330
No.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.598
Okay, good, good. Oh...

09:26.600 --> 09:28.400
Is this because Todd's here?

09:28.402 --> 09:31.002
Okay, talk to you later.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.904
CAROL:
<i>It's... It seems</i>
<i>like it's a lot</i>

09:32.906 --> 09:34.439
of glitter until
you get it on,

09:34.441 --> 09:35.907
and then you just
want more glitter.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.742
MELISSA:
It's pretty.
Knock, knock.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.879
I'm here for the group outing.

09:40.881 --> 09:44.215
Ah, showed up fashionably
on time. H-Hey, Melissa.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.518
Hey, Todd.
Look at you two

09:46.520 --> 09:49.054
in your fun casual wear.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.790
Well, I'm so excited about
today. I can't wait to just

09:51.792 --> 09:54.192
get out there and just
have some fun... (gulps)

09:55.194 --> 09:56.261
Excuse me.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.929
That was weird.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.265
I'm assuming
it was nothing.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.900
So what's the plan, Stan?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.935
Well, we are going
to Señor Goodtimes

10:03.937 --> 10:05.870
Family Funtorium
on Third Street.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.606
They got mini golf.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.808
Go-karts. The whole
kitchen caboodle...

10:09.810 --> 10:11.242
(gulps)

10:11.244 --> 10:12.877
Carol?

10:12.879 --> 10:14.546
Kitchen cabood...

10:14.548 --> 10:16.147
Oh, no.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.415
Here we go again.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.883
Carol, you okay?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.285
Hang on one second.
I'm sorry.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.354
No.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.589
(muffled groan)

10:24.591 --> 10:26.891
(vomiting,
splattering)

10:26.893 --> 10:29.828
(coughs, gagging)

10:31.564 --> 10:33.798
(gagging)

10:33.800 --> 10:35.634
(coughing)

10:35.636 --> 10:38.937
(sighs) Okay.
All better now.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.639
(loud retching)

10:40.641 --> 10:42.907
(coughs)
Ooh.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.976
(panting)

10:47.279 --> 10:48.947
Oh.
C...

10:48.949 --> 10:50.849
I am so sorry.
TODD:
No.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.251
I don't know if you heard that,
but I just vomited.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.653
Yeah.
Yeah, we heard.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.254
Want to see it for proof?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.489
No, no, no, no.
No, it's okay.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.657
I just don't know

10:58.659 --> 11:00.825
if I can go
on this outing anymore.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.761
You two go ahead without me.
TODD:
You sure?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.429
Yeah.
Hey, party's in here
I guess, huh?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.765
We're not gonna leave
you here when you're sick.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.767
Oh, that's okay. Phil... Phil
will take care of me. Phil?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.468
What?
I just vomited.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.337
It's in the pot
if you want proof.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.106
I'm gonna need you to
stay here with me, so...

11:15.108 --> 11:16.474
I want to go with them.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.609
Phil, you can't leave

11:17.611 --> 11:19.144
your sick wife all alone.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.612
Yeah, but, Carol...

11:20.614 --> 11:21.846
Uh...

11:22.948 --> 11:25.016
You're right.
You're right, yeah.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.785
You guys go ahead without us.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.887
Uh, got to stay here
with my number one.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.355
(laughter)

11:30.357 --> 11:31.723
You guys have fun.
TODD:
All right.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.124
MELISSA:
Thanks. Well,
feel better.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.292
TODD:
Yeah.
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.493
TODD:
Bye.
Gosh.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.695
Bye.
Bye, Phil.
Thank you.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.697
See you, buddy.
Yup. Yup.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.067
And that's the Pilbasian nudge.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.501
(laughs)

11:43.503 --> 11:45.603
You want some soup?

11:51.243 --> 11:53.244
(laughing)

11:53.246 --> 11:55.647
MELISSA:
Gonna bump ya.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.415
Oh. Oh, yeah?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.250
(laughing)

11:59.252 --> 12:01.319
Oh, you having fun, playing
around on your little date?

12:01.321 --> 12:04.322
(whooping, laughing)
(laughing)

12:04.324 --> 12:06.725
She makes it seem like
she's having fun by laughing,

12:06.727 --> 12:08.660
but I know
what her real laugh's like.

12:08.662 --> 12:09.928
(screaming)

12:09.930 --> 12:12.097
(laughter)
PHIL: God.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.999
What a waste
of an afternoon for her.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.402
Break something
in the parking lot.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.536
Señor Goodtimes.
MELISSA:
That's my goal.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.671
Got it. I can feel it.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.842
(ball thudding)
Oh, my goodness!

12:23.844 --> 12:27.011
Oh, playing normal golf
at a putt-putt place.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.513
How original!

12:28.515 --> 12:30.415
I did that on, like,
day one here.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.551
(whooping)
PHIL:
Can't you get it
through your head, dude?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.420
You're in the friend zone!

12:35.422 --> 12:36.721
Ready?
Yes.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.022
Eyes closed.
Okay.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.626
Mmm.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.195
Easy. Sour apple.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.730
(chuckling)
You are good.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.266
All right, your turn. Ready?
Okay.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.268
Don't give me licorice again.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.738
(laughing):
What kind of guy do you
think I am, huh? Mm.
(laughs)

12:53.740 --> 12:56.040
Todd. Ew! Todd!
I didn't know that was licorice.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.743
I didn't know
it was licorice.
Jellybean shower for you.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.245
Okay. I swear
I didn't know.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.946
(laughing):
You're getting a
jellybean shower.
No!

13:01.948 --> 13:04.549
(Melissa shrieks)
TODD:
You are!

13:04.551 --> 13:07.118
You're gonna get it.
(laughing)

13:07.120 --> 13:10.388
You can't be falling
for this dude, can you?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.724
Truce?
All right.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.626
Nah, you're just friends.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.467
PHIL:
<i>Carol, I don't want to</i>

13:22.469 --> 13:25.403
demean your system here,
but it's just so elaborate.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.739
You just have a rag and a brush?

13:27.741 --> 13:30.742
Just keep spinning.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.978
Oh, I heard Melissa and Todd
had a really fun time today.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.314
Is that so?
That is so.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.751
And, uh, they're going
on another date tomorrow.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.786
What?
Yeah, a tennis date.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.121
(laughs)

13:43.123 --> 13:45.290
Ah, I told you all they needed
was a little nudge.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.091
Carol, will you
stop nudging them?

13:47.093 --> 13:48.426
It's just wrong!

13:48.428 --> 13:50.028
I mean, you're
trying to play God.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.629
That's enough nudges!

13:51.631 --> 13:53.097
This one wasn't me.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.099
Melissa asked Todd.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.468
She did?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.537
That's the power
of the Pilbasian nudge.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.306
It's like a Slinky.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.508
I just give them
the initial push, and they take

14:03.510 --> 14:05.310
the rest of the steps
on their own.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.212
You know what, Carol?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.446
Maybe we should join them.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.015
I think we should let them
be alone together.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.884
Well, this is a really
critical time for them.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.353
You know, one false move, and
the whole thing could be off.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.223
Phil Miller, getting in
on the nudge game, huh?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.725
I just want to be
there to make sure

14:20.727 --> 14:23.962
things go exactly
how we want them to.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.632
All right, guys, well, thanks
again for letting us join here.
Mm-hmm.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.901
Yeah. Keep in mind,
I've never played
before. Thanks.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.303
Well, don't worry, Todd.
You're gonna be on my team.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.405
I'll show you the ropes.
Oh, no, no, no.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.074
I think Todd should
be with Melissa.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.176
Oh, too late, Carol.
I called him.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.178
(Phil laughs, laughter)

14:40.180 --> 14:42.547
Okay, so, Melissa, why don't you
and Carol be shirts,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.249
and Todd and I will be skins?

14:45.985 --> 14:47.685
Shirts and skins?
You don't do that in tennis.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.687
Oh, no, not normally,
but you know,

14:49.689 --> 14:51.022
Todd's new to
the game. I think

14:51.024 --> 14:52.891
it'll be easier
for him to identify the teams

14:52.893 --> 14:54.158
if we're doing shirts and skins.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.994
There's a net
separating the teams.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.695
Yeah, but what if
the net breaks?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.564
Oh, look at you.
Got a little belly.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.199
(laughs)
No, I don't. I do not.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.500
Pop a skin. Come on.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.168
Uh, you know, I don't care.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.004
I mean, it's kind of hot
out here anyway, so,

15:06.006 --> 15:07.405
skins it is.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.074
MELISSA:
Oh, my God.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.176
Todd, what happened?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.344
It's pretty simple really.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.612
Just a long history
of overeating.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.382
You mean the scar?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.017
Scar?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.685
Oh, ew!
(laughs)

15:20.687 --> 15:22.887
It's disgusting, right?

15:22.889 --> 15:26.190
I donated one of my kidneys
to my foster brother Hector.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.726
Oh, that is so sweet.
CAROL: Todd.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.361
Tennis, anyone?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.931
It was about
ten years ago.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.367
He had this disease where his
kidneys couldn't process sodium.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.103
We could not find a donor.
You know, so I got checked out.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.905
It was a match,
and, uh...
Love serving love!

15:40.907 --> 15:42.373
...a week later,
we did the surgery.
Yeah.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.708
First, it was looking
really good, you know?

15:43.710 --> 15:44.909
Love serving love.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.711
Hector was starting
to get his color back.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.113
And all of a sudden...
Okay, fault!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.715
...his body rejected the kidney.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.883
Oh.
Aw.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.618
Just like that, he was gone.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.387
PHIL:
Uh... let.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.755
He was only 13.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.223
PHIL:
Serving two!

15:59.225 --> 16:00.925
CAROL: That's horrible.
I'm so sorry.
PHIL: Up!

16:00.927 --> 16:04.095
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna...

16:04.097 --> 16:05.830
PHIL:
Guys, we're losing
the light here!

16:05.832 --> 16:08.232
Need a minute. Thank you.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.802
Wait, Todd. Wait.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.071
Oh, poor guy.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.640
I'm gonna go check on Todd.
No, leave them alone!

16:15.642 --> 16:18.009
I will.
Oh...

16:22.815 --> 16:25.750
Oh.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.852
Brilliant nudge.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.322
How did you know
about the scar?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.092
Just dumb luck, I guess.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.827
CAROL:
Well, it worked perfectly.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.400
Mm.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.107
(whispering):
Got to stop this.
Got to stop this.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.775
Got to do something
to stop this.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.343
Stop this.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.780
Hey! Just checking in
to see how you're doing tonight.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.948
I'm fine.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.617
Good, good. Good.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.986
So, uh, Todd, huh?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.187
(chuckles)

17:03.189 --> 17:04.789
What a guy.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.057
Yeah, he's a great guy.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.458
Yeah, yeah.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.994
Just a big ol' breath
of fresh air, or...

17:09.996 --> 17:11.963
seems like it right now
at least, huh?

17:11.965 --> 17:13.464
How so?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.466
Well...

17:15.468 --> 17:18.169
I have a lot of experience
with the fat community.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.239
Uh, in the old world,
all of my friends were fats.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.408
You know,
just every last one of them.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.310
My skinniest friend was 225,
and he was five foot, two.

17:26.312 --> 17:29.013
So I know the mindset
of the fats very well.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.681
And what is the mindset?

17:30.683 --> 17:33.051
Fats are very loose
with the facts.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.154
You know, they've been ridiculed
their whole lives, so they,

17:36.156 --> 17:37.889
you know...
they pump up their stats.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.425
Uh, for instance, a fat who
works in a mailroom might claim

17:40.427 --> 17:42.827
at a cocktail party that
they're the CEO of the company.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.829
That kind of stuff. Uh...

17:44.831 --> 17:48.366
You know, I hate to say this,
I really do, but...

17:48.368 --> 17:50.501
it's hard to trust fats.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.670
You are such an ass.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.905
I'm concerned about you.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.406
Wait! Wait! Wait! Melissa!

17:55.408 --> 17:57.575
Come on, I'm trying
to help you here!

17:58.544 --> 18:01.512
Damn it!

18:01.514 --> 18:03.581
(sighs)

18:09.021 --> 18:11.089
(sighs)

18:12.624 --> 18:14.392
Melissa!

18:14.394 --> 18:16.694
I'm sorry. Todd's a great guy.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.362
He didn't deserve this.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.598
I think I'm going crazy.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.734
(sighs)

18:23.736 --> 18:26.571
Look, for the last
two years, I've...

18:26.573 --> 18:28.773
All I've been doing is,
like, going around

18:28.775 --> 18:30.808
drinking and breaking stuff

18:30.810 --> 18:35.279
and-and talking to sports balls
like they were people.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.882
But now that actual people
are here, I...

18:37.884 --> 18:41.119
You know, I'm still trying to
figure out how to talk to 'em.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.888
So... you're right.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.124
I'm an ass.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.226
But whether
you believe it or not,

18:48.228 --> 18:50.995
I'm-I'm really, really sorry.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.665
Okay. Good night.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.408
You talk to sports balls?

19:04.410 --> 19:06.477
PHIL:
And that's Bryce,
and that is Antawn

19:06.479 --> 19:09.080
and Diego and Gary.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.615
Gary's like my
best friend.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.784
(laughs)
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.186
Thanks for
showing me this.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.787
That explains
a lot, actually.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.422
Yeah. I know.
(laughs)

19:18.424 --> 19:20.124
You want a whiskey?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.659
Sure.
Okay.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.828
All right.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.830
Phil, can I ask
you something?

19:25.832 --> 19:28.099
Sure.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.334
What's your favorite movie?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.603
(laughs)

19:32.605 --> 19:34.105
What is my favorite movie?

19:34.107 --> 19:37.141
Mm.
Uh...

19:37.143 --> 19:39.177
<i>The Godfather.</i>

19:39.179 --> 19:40.845
Why didn't you just say that?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.281
I don't know.
I just... I don't know.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.284
<i>The Godfather</i> is like
my second favorite movie.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.286
And Tom Hanks is phenomenal
in it.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.688
(both laugh)

19:50.690 --> 19:53.791
I deserved that.
I did deserve that.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.993
Just be honest
with me about stuff.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.795
Yeah?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.197
Yeah.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.566
Okay, okay.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.634
Well, here goes nothing.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.738
(exhales loudly
through his mouth)

20:09.308 --> 20:13.678
You... were the one
I was waiting for.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.646
From the moment I met you,

20:15.648 --> 20:18.482
you took my breath away.

20:18.484 --> 20:22.486
I mean, I've never felt this way
about anybody else before.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.222
And...

20:24.224 --> 20:26.157
when I'm around you,
I'm a frigging idiot.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.725
I say the dumbest things.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.827
Because I can't
think straight.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.497
Because...
when I look into your eyes,

20:33.499 --> 20:35.666
all I can think about is

20:35.668 --> 20:38.069
how every minute
of every day

20:38.071 --> 20:41.505
I want to be
looking into those eyes.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.010
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.712
Is there any chance

20:47.714 --> 20:50.915
that you would feel
that same way about me?

20:52.784 --> 20:54.852
No.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.463
So I was gonna say
all that stuff to Carol.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.932
Uh, what do you think?
Any notes? (sniffles)

21:07.934 --> 21:09.900
No, I think
Carol will love that.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.236
Yeah, good. Okay,
that's what I was thinking, too.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.773
Yeah, I'll just keep it exactly
the same for Carol. Yeah.
