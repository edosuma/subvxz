WEBVTT

00:03.763 --> 00:06.480
England is in need of
a jolly good scare.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.759
Blow up the observatory?

00:07.759 --> 00:09.118
I give you a month.

00:09.118 --> 00:10.716
Can you supply a bomb?

00:10.716 --> 00:13.513
I can supply a bomb.
Will you explode it?

00:19.427 --> 00:21.265
Tell Heat it's The Strand next.

00:21.265 --> 00:22.824
'The Professor's on an omnibus.'

00:22.824 --> 00:25.262
Get a message sent he's
not to be approached!

00:25.262 --> 00:28.098
Do you know what
a secret is, Stevie?

00:28.098 --> 00:30.177
Not even Winnie must know.

00:30.177 --> 00:33.253
Despite what you said,
we are a true family.

00:33.253 --> 00:34.812
Could be father and son.

00:44.242 --> 00:47.239
'Mr Michaelis is going to my
cottage in Kent to write a book.'

00:47.239 --> 00:48.278
Stevie!

00:49.996 --> 00:53.712
We've got a job to do. This is a
serious business we're doing here.

00:58.907 --> 01:01.904
This new thing between them,
I'm so hopeful about it.

01:01.904 --> 01:05.459
Tell yourself that lie, but imagine
more than just a day with me.

01:05.459 --> 01:06.660
Who have you supplied?

01:07.658 --> 01:09.576
Who have you supplied?!

01:10.616 --> 01:12.214
- I'll go for you!
- Stevie!

01:12.214 --> 01:13.732
- No! - I'm a good boy.
- Stevie!

01:28.277 --> 01:31.714
He's having the time of his
life, Winnie. He's climbing trees.

01:37.908 --> 01:39.546
What do we do about this Verloc?

01:39.546 --> 01:43.421
In my opinion, offer him immunity
from prosecution in exchange for

01:43.421 --> 01:44.741
everything he can tell us.

01:44.741 --> 01:46.060
Is there a body here?

01:46.060 --> 01:48.097
It's not a body. It's just a mess.

01:49.696 --> 01:51.654
You've no idea what's
happened, have you?

01:51.654 --> 01:54.171
'He said he was climbing trees,
getting his trousers dirty.'

01:54.171 --> 01:55.690
He said he was having fun.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.964
Not all of it was blown to bits.

02:02.043 --> 02:04.481
She knows.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.115
She's waiting for you.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.629
'EXPLOSION'

02:38.686 --> 02:40.564
BELL TINKLES

02:58.905 --> 03:00.064
I saw Heat leave.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.816
I spoke to him, actually.

03:13.411 --> 03:14.729
At least you know now.

03:16.847 --> 03:17.887
About Stevie.

03:20.163 --> 03:21.723
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

03:23.641 --> 03:24.999
I didn't know how to...

03:27.556 --> 03:29.194
You do see that, don't you?

03:36.587 --> 03:37.626
But if...

03:40.943 --> 03:42.182
..you let me explain...

03:44.659 --> 03:45.698
Look...

03:46.777 --> 03:51.493
Yes, I got Stevie involved,
but I had to, Winnie.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.729
I've had no choice in any of this.

03:54.729 --> 03:57.845
I take payments from
the Russian embassy.

03:57.845 --> 04:01.003
I suppose I'm a spy, and...

04:01.003 --> 04:03.880
They wanted an explosion, and
if I didn't give it to them...

04:07.796 --> 04:10.473
The way he was using me, Winnie.

04:10.473 --> 04:11.512
Threatening me.

04:12.591 --> 04:15.947
If I hadn't agreed to do it, what
would have become of us all?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.179
So...

04:28.215 --> 04:32.090
I showed Stevie what
I was doing, it's true.

04:37.046 --> 04:40.002
He was never meant to be the
one who actually planted it.

04:45.837 --> 04:47.196
I meant the boy no harm.

04:59.063 --> 05:00.263
And how could he just...

05:01.901 --> 05:04.619
..come in here and blurt
it out to you like that?

05:05.617 --> 05:08.894
I've been sat in the
pub for hours, just...

05:08.894 --> 05:12.090
thinking of a way to tell you,
and he just waltzes in.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.527
You know what his problem is?

05:14.527 --> 05:16.127
He thinks it's just information.

05:17.605 --> 05:19.163
It's the policeman in him.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.918
It's unforgivable.

05:25.557 --> 05:26.836
No empathy at all.

06:38.603 --> 06:39.881
'We have to go for Verloc.

06:39.881 --> 06:41.879
'Not bargain with him,
but detain him.'

06:41.879 --> 06:42.999
Prosecution?

06:42.999 --> 06:46.634
I put it to the Attorney General
about making use of him.

06:46.634 --> 06:50.151
Wasn't keen at all. Had had a word with
the Foreign Secretary, if you ask me.

06:50.151 --> 06:51.389
And their thinking?

06:51.389 --> 06:53.908
Foreign spies on our soil
immune from the rule of law?

06:53.908 --> 06:56.785
We turn a blind eye, we
just look blind. Or feeble.

06:56.785 --> 06:59.422
So, we need to make an
example of Verloc?

06:59.422 --> 07:01.340
Yes. But, ultimately,

07:01.340 --> 07:04.377
the only way is to make the
employment of these spies

07:04.377 --> 07:06.335
unpleasant to their employers.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.651
Very well, Home Secretary, I shall...

07:11.090 --> 07:12.329
..approach his employer.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.238
If I'm taken away...

07:26.035 --> 07:27.913
..you'll need your wits about you.

07:37.863 --> 07:40.380
You need to start thinking
about tomorrow.

07:44.176 --> 07:46.414
So, you need to...

07:48.052 --> 07:51.169
You can't sit here like this.

07:51.169 --> 07:52.807
You could look at me, Winnie.

08:07.193 --> 08:08.752
I knew you'd take it hard.

08:11.589 --> 08:15.185
But you've got to see
the whole picture.

08:15.185 --> 08:18.901
And... there's still the two of us.

08:18.901 --> 08:21.578
And...being like this...

08:21.578 --> 08:24.455
well, it...it won't bring
him back, will it?

08:24.455 --> 08:25.854
What will?

08:27.852 --> 08:30.089
- What?
- What will bring him back?

08:34.206 --> 08:35.244
Nothing.

08:38.679 --> 08:39.880
Did he scream?

08:44.315 --> 08:45.513
He felt no pain.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.230
I'm sure of it.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.909
How do you know?

08:54.904 --> 08:58.141
I'm not screaming.

09:01.298 --> 09:02.737
I feel so trapped with it.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.963
I thought it'd be an end
to all our troubles,

09:05.973 --> 09:08.011
and it's ended up being
nothing of the sort.

09:10.169 --> 09:11.208
But this...

09:13.966 --> 09:16.082
Well, they'll take me away, but...

09:17.362 --> 09:19.079
..if you were to wait for me...

09:21.797 --> 09:25.114
..and...and then shop to
keep going while...

09:25.114 --> 09:28.710
while I'm detained, we
could pick up again.

09:28.710 --> 09:31.307
I've been to prison before,
it won't affect me.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.584
It's safer in there
than running away.

09:38.221 --> 09:41.338
Please, Winnie.

09:41.338 --> 09:42.896
Don't be a fool.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.158
I kept calling Stevie back.

10:02.955 --> 10:04.594
But he wouldn't listen to me.

10:07.910 --> 10:10.228
He took it upon himself
to carry the bomb.

10:14.224 --> 10:16.183
Why did he have to be...

10:16.183 --> 10:17.301
wilful like that?

10:28.090 --> 10:30.957
We are rather surprised that you've
insisted on so immediate an appointment.

10:30.967 --> 10:31.926
We?

10:31.926 --> 10:35.283
I don't think this appointment involves
you being in the room, Privy Councillor.

10:35.283 --> 10:37.401
I meant that you had
more pressing engagements.

10:37.401 --> 10:39.438
This bomb outrage,
the safety of London.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.838
That's exactly why I'm here.

10:40.838 --> 10:44.593
Greenwich being a symptom, the
cause perhaps here in Kensington.

10:52.186 --> 10:55.183
We know that Verloc
planted the bomb.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.620
- Verloc?
- You know him.

10:57.620 --> 10:58.659
You employ him.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.337
What makes you say that?

11:00.337 --> 11:02.415
I say nothing of the sort,
my inspector says it.

11:02.415 --> 11:04.293
He also makes use of him,

11:04.293 --> 11:06.611
and uses your little secret
as leverage against him.

11:10.728 --> 11:13.484
Do you remember when you
accused me of complacency,

11:13.484 --> 11:15.802
accused every Government agency?

11:15.802 --> 11:19.479
Well, you could say we've
taken your advice.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.997
An end to tolerance.

11:22.155 --> 11:24.963
And what do you intend to do
with this Verloc, deport him?

11:24.973 --> 11:25.912
No.

11:25.912 --> 11:28.669
We rather thought a prosecution would
best demonstrate to the public

11:28.669 --> 11:30.387
both the danger and the indecency.

11:30.387 --> 11:33.064
You really think you'd induce a
man like this to admit anything?

11:33.064 --> 11:36.461
Absolutely, if he thought
his punishment to be mitigated.

11:36.461 --> 11:39.018
And, if not, we have a wealth
of detail in any case.

11:39.018 --> 11:42.734
We have a joint enemy.
The anarchists, not each other.

11:42.734 --> 11:45.012
We're well aware of the
genuine article.

11:45.012 --> 11:47.649
That's why we can't be
distracted by shams like this.

11:49.687 --> 11:51.406
And so you will prosecute Verloc?

11:54.683 --> 11:57.680
I wonder how efficient the
prosecution of the Professor

11:57.680 --> 11:59.478
will make you look.

12:00.516 --> 12:03.394
The public will be happy to know
that we've foiled an outrage.

12:03.394 --> 12:06.551
That a man with a bomb strapped to him
was roaming the streets of London?

12:06.551 --> 12:08.109
That bomb didn't go off.

12:09.268 --> 12:10.307
Yours did.

12:26.331 --> 12:27.649
Our arrangement...

12:29.567 --> 12:33.522
..was always that you took
no interest in my affairs.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.760
That's how it's worked.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.395
You always said things
didn't bear much looking into.

12:42.714 --> 12:43.953
In fact, Winnie...

12:45.511 --> 12:46.989
..you looked the other way.

12:50.426 --> 12:51.585
I made it easy.

12:57.379 --> 12:58.940
I made it easy for you to...

12:58.950 --> 13:01.934
You mustn't spend too long
blaming yourself, Winnie.

13:04.331 --> 13:05.450
What matters now is...

13:06.649 --> 13:08.207
..how we go along together.

13:12.724 --> 13:15.760
You've no idea what a bastard
I've been dealing with.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.877
What a jeering,

13:18.877 --> 13:20.995
pitiless, dangerous bastard!

13:20.995 --> 13:24.511
VERLOC: 'There isn't an anarchist plot
in the last 11 years I haven't thwarted.

13:24.511 --> 13:27.788
'The scores of revolutionaries
that I've dispatched...'

13:27.788 --> 13:32.263
I could be stabbed in the back at
any time, he wouldn't give a damn.

13:32.263 --> 13:35.460
If you want someone
to blame, blame him.

13:37.937 --> 13:40.296
I don't understand a
word you're saying.

13:48.807 --> 13:51.044
What's done can't be undone.

14:06.629 --> 14:08.706
You know what you need?

14:11.944 --> 14:13.183
Good cry.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.459
Because you haven't.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.135
It's not natural.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.807
These things...

14:29.605 --> 14:31.843
They have to come out.

14:31.843 --> 14:34.201
Emotion, I mean.

14:46.867 --> 14:48.107
Going for a rest?

14:52.942 --> 14:55.299
Bit of peace and quiet,
yeah, that...

14:57.138 --> 14:59.015
That'll do you the world of good.

15:11.403 --> 15:14.959
FOOTSTEPS AND DOOR
CLOSING UPSTAIRS

16:01.952 --> 16:03.829
'Calm me down, Winnie.'

16:18.775 --> 16:21.292
STAIRCASE CREAKS

16:30.603 --> 16:32.600
Flying off to your mother's?

16:32.600 --> 16:33.839
No sense going now.

16:34.918 --> 16:37.596
She'll have gone to bed by
the time you get there.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.713
This is the sort of
news that can wait.

16:42.351 --> 16:45.228
Tonight, your place is
here with me, Winnie.

16:45.228 --> 16:47.225
Just take off your hat and sit down.

16:51.861 --> 16:54.658
I can't just let you go...
wandering about outside.

16:57.495 --> 16:58.734
I just can't have it.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.290
And this veil...

17:04.288 --> 17:06.527
I barely know who I'm talking to.

17:09.282 --> 17:11.201
That's better.

17:20.872 --> 17:23.829
Not that you're saying anything
back to me, anyway.

17:26.586 --> 17:31.301
Perhaps because you know it was you who
kept shoving the boy in my direction.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.580
What made you do it?

17:35.177 --> 17:38.214
Look, this...this deaf-and-dumb
act, it's gone too far.

17:40.691 --> 17:44.408
At least his troubles are over now,
whereas ours are just beginning.

17:44.408 --> 17:48.363
We ought to start thinking
about what we're going to do.

17:48.363 --> 17:50.282
I can't have you galloping
off to your mother

17:50.282 --> 17:53.359
with some crazy tale or
other about me. I won't have it.

17:58.993 --> 18:01.111
I wish I'd never seen Greenwich Park.

18:06.266 --> 18:07.304
"A nice walk."

18:08.304 --> 18:09.543
Winnie...

18:09.543 --> 18:12.420
"Imagine how good a few days
in Kent would be for him."

18:15.456 --> 18:17.973
- "Me and him in the countryside..."
- Let it lie now, Winnie.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.492
No more trouble.

18:20.492 --> 18:22.010
"Could be father and son."

18:23.408 --> 18:24.448
No more.

18:31.161 --> 18:32.199
Winnie...

18:39.273 --> 18:40.311
Yes.

18:43.788 --> 18:44.826
Come here.

20:25.924 --> 20:28.082
(Murderess.)

21:15.753 --> 21:16.833
You're here.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.987
Only because I thought you would be.

21:27.302 --> 21:28.940
Sit down with me.

21:52.037 --> 21:53.516
I was on my way to you.

21:55.473 --> 21:57.631
I thought so much about you,

21:57.631 --> 21:59.429
since I read about the bombing.

22:00.828 --> 22:03.345
I'm very sorry.

22:03.345 --> 22:04.744
Will you help me?

22:06.662 --> 22:09.419
No-one is more ready to help
you in your trouble.

22:11.856 --> 22:13.615
Do you know what my trouble is?

22:15.334 --> 22:19.170
I couldn't be absolutely
sure from the newspaper report,

22:19.170 --> 22:21.727
but now you appear like this, I...

22:21.727 --> 22:23.844
I understand exactly what happened.

22:25.124 --> 22:26.162
What will I do?

22:27.161 --> 22:30.238
Winnie, you...you are free now.

22:30.238 --> 22:31.437
Truly.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.995
I can't be.

22:32.995 --> 22:34.034
No.

22:35.513 --> 22:36.991
Unless...

22:36.991 --> 22:38.909
people understand perhaps
what happened.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.027
Verloc brought about his
own death when he...

22:41.027 --> 22:42.586
He was a bastard to me.

22:42.586 --> 22:43.624
Yes.

22:45.422 --> 22:46.461
But not me, Winnie.

22:48.539 --> 22:49.658
You'll take me away?

22:51.058 --> 22:53.095
You will let me escape with you?

22:53.095 --> 22:55.652
You have done so before?

22:55.652 --> 22:57.731
- Run away?
- Yes.

22:57.731 --> 22:59.449
We can run away together.

23:00.648 --> 23:01.805
We can go anywhere.

23:05.403 --> 23:06.761
Tom, there's some money.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.718
- If we go...
- Verloc's money?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.875
He kept it hidden away, you see.

23:15.473 --> 23:17.791
The money's...at the shop, Tom.

23:19.788 --> 23:20.827
All of it.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.622
You deserve it. And we can
make a life with it?

23:25.622 --> 23:26.661
Yes.

23:34.293 --> 23:36.330
You forgot to shut the door.

23:39.768 --> 23:41.286
BELL TINKLES

23:45.961 --> 23:47.040
Show me.

23:48.039 --> 23:50.117
I've left the light on
in the parlour.

23:50.117 --> 23:52.674
The money's in there, on the shelf.

24:08.937 --> 24:10.657
How can this be?

24:10.657 --> 24:12.214
HE INHALES SHARPLY

24:13.613 --> 24:16.050
Haven't you guessed what
I was driven to do?

24:21.206 --> 24:22.804
You will save me, Tom?

24:24.083 --> 24:26.001
Please, don't let them hang me.

24:26.001 --> 24:27.839
You did this thing all by yourself?

24:29.277 --> 24:30.516
Yes.

24:33.394 --> 24:34.711
Where's Stevie?

24:36.830 --> 24:39.188
Blown to bits in Greenwich Park.

24:41.704 --> 24:44.541
Verloc took him away
and murdered him.

24:46.739 --> 24:50.456
And then came back, like any other
man would come back to his wife.

24:52.214 --> 24:55.091
So, you just...
stabbed him to death?

24:56.969 --> 24:59.806
He was resting on the sofa
after his supper.

25:01.844 --> 25:03.323
Resting easy.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.558
"Come here," he said to me...

25:09.197 --> 25:13.352
..after he's killed my Stevie..
my baby.

25:15.230 --> 25:16.670
So I came all right.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.145
What did he expect?

25:21.145 --> 25:23.143
He took the heart out of me.

25:30.895 --> 25:32.773
Please, Tom.

25:41.485 --> 25:44.122
The money's in the box over there.

26:39.226 --> 26:41.503
Don't throw me off now, Tom.

26:53.132 --> 26:55.490
It's been years since
I made an arrest.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.526
- Good to get my feet out from under the desk.
- Sure.

26:58.526 --> 27:00.285
This has to look conspicuous, Heat.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.163
Show them how serious
we are about it.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.241
You had other plans for
Verloc yesterday.

27:04.241 --> 27:06.078
That was yesterday.

27:07.118 --> 27:09.955
RAUCOUS VOICES BEHIND WALL

27:15.189 --> 27:17.267
You will save me from the hangman?

27:27.336 --> 27:29.814
If they find us, they'll
say it's a conspiracy.

27:31.253 --> 27:33.171
That I am your accomplice.

27:35.089 --> 27:38.446
So you're wedded to me, whether
you like it or not.

27:38.446 --> 27:41.203
I'm very happy that our fates
are to be bound together.

27:42.801 --> 27:44.639
That we will be together.

27:48.356 --> 27:49.874
Are you cold?

27:49.874 --> 27:51.393
Not here.

27:54.429 --> 27:56.227
Are you?

27:57.626 --> 27:58.666
No.

29:00.482 --> 29:01.641
This is...

29:06.716 --> 29:08.993
A revenge attack?
One of his own, perhaps?

29:10.072 --> 29:14.708
I was thinking more in the way of a
husband killed and a... missing wife.

29:14.708 --> 29:17.185
Are we in the presence
of a domestic drama?

29:19.103 --> 29:22.420
And I'm supposed to go to the
Home Secretary and...tell him, what,

29:22.420 --> 29:25.178
that our foreign policy
has been thwarted by...

29:25.178 --> 29:27.175
a bloody carving knife?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.053
Find her.

29:34.887 --> 29:37.166
Do you suppose Verloc
volunteered the part

29:37.166 --> 29:38.843
he played in her brother's death?

29:40.722 --> 29:41.760
Never.

29:43.359 --> 29:44.997
Then, who did?

29:48.833 --> 29:50.511
Find her.

29:52.110 --> 29:54.788
Alert every constable on the beat.
Get men at every train terminal.

29:54.788 --> 29:56.785
I'll pay a visit to the mother.

29:56.785 --> 29:59.423
Between us all, we should find her.

30:10.172 --> 30:11.691
We did wish them more vigilant.

30:11.691 --> 30:14.247
- Yes, not so much that they'd...
- Start a diplomatic incident?

30:14.247 --> 30:17.405
If they get Verloc in that
dock and make him talk,

30:17.405 --> 30:20.682
the embarrassment that will cause
our government. I will be recalled,

30:20.682 --> 30:22.119
for God's sake!

30:22.119 --> 30:24.238
Rather more than recalled, I fear.

30:28.673 --> 30:30.511
Wurmt.

30:32.869 --> 30:34.507
Wurmt!

30:34.507 --> 30:37.984
- Verloc! - First Secretary?
- Bring him here.

30:37.984 --> 30:40.941
Bring him here, before the
police take hold of him.

30:40.941 --> 30:42.899
- I can summon him.
- No, no, we need to act now.

30:42.899 --> 30:46.535
We need to get him smuggled out
of the country as soon as possible.

30:47.654 --> 30:49.811
Well, go! Take somebody with you.

30:49.811 --> 30:53.209
I am merely a privy counsellor,
First Secretary. Clerical.

30:57.165 --> 30:59.762
The boat leaves
Southampton at midnight.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.838
- Will we be safe?
- Let's get to Paris first,

31:03.838 --> 31:05.356
the best way we can.

31:05.356 --> 31:06.514
Paris?

31:08.113 --> 31:09.312
And then?

31:17.424 --> 31:19.782
Wherever we can be left in peace.

31:51.749 --> 31:54.186
BELL RINGS

32:10.410 --> 32:13.567
I'll buy the tickets to
Saint-Malo. Let's go separately.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.765
We mustn't be seen together.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.083
Stay out of sight.

32:34.905 --> 32:36.583
Some trouble here?

32:36.583 --> 32:38.581
What business would you
have here, sir?

32:38.581 --> 32:41.338
Oh, nothing but curiosity.

32:41.338 --> 32:43.136
Someone killed?

32:43.136 --> 32:44.815
The, er, shop owner?

32:44.815 --> 32:47.212
Were you acquainted with him, sir?

32:47.212 --> 32:49.410
Well, merely as a customer.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.568
But if you asked me were I, erm...

32:53.007 --> 32:54.725
He's dead? Murdered?

32:57.962 --> 33:01.318
Well...this is some
news, is it not?

33:03.357 --> 33:07.512
As for myself, I shall thank
God to be safely in my bed tonight.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.298
I should never have left them.

33:22.937 --> 33:25.014
SHE SOBS

33:25.014 --> 33:27.412
I promise you, madam...

33:27.412 --> 33:29.650
your son felt no pain.

33:32.087 --> 33:34.525
But you cannot say the
same for Winnie.

33:54.105 --> 33:56.782
Two returns to Southampton, please.

34:04.614 --> 34:06.013
Thank you.

34:06.013 --> 34:07.212
Sir?

34:16.643 --> 34:18.199
Your change, sir.

34:20.398 --> 34:22.476
LONG WHISTLE

34:43.135 --> 34:45.053
- Stevie!
- BOY CHUCKLES

34:46.851 --> 34:48.728
SHE GASPS

35:01.117 --> 35:02.756
Sir.

35:04.154 --> 35:06.232
Poor woman could hardly speak.

35:06.232 --> 35:08.669
But she feels if there was
a man she may have formed

35:08.669 --> 35:11.466
an association with,
it would be Ossipon.

35:11.466 --> 35:12.945
He was kind to Stevie.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.382
Any clue from her mother as to
where they may have run to?

35:15.382 --> 35:18.020
Well, Winnie only knows London.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.539
Ossipon's European.

35:19.539 --> 35:21.457
Then France, sir?

36:11.965 --> 36:13.044
Madam.

36:14.043 --> 36:15.522
Ticket, please.

36:17.959 --> 36:20.397
Thank you, madam.

36:20.397 --> 36:21.755
SHE GASPS

36:23.114 --> 36:25.351
Relatives in Southampton, ma'am?

36:26.710 --> 36:28.228
Er, no.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.947
So, what takes you there?

36:31.265 --> 36:33.743
I'm going to get the...
midnight boat from there.

36:33.743 --> 36:36.859
- The midnight boat to Saint-Malo.
- Saint-Malo?

36:36.859 --> 36:38.419
And unaccompanied?

36:38.419 --> 36:40.457
That's quite an adventure, ma'am.

36:43.054 --> 36:46.610
Yes. I'm joining my husband there.

36:46.610 --> 36:48.928
What is your husband's
business there?

36:50.207 --> 36:51.885
He's an importer.

36:53.402 --> 36:55.441
Wine and other things.

36:55.441 --> 36:57.119
No luggage, ma'am?

36:59.277 --> 37:01.755
- I intend to come back soon.
- Soon?

37:01.755 --> 37:02.953
WHISTLE

37:02.953 --> 37:04.552
Tomorrow, in fact.

37:08.068 --> 37:11.705
My husband rents a
cottage in Saint-Malo.

37:11.705 --> 37:13.702
I have belongings there.

37:15.661 --> 37:18.337
The Southampton-Malo train
leaves at 10:30.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.535
Portsmouth, ten minutes after that.

37:20.535 --> 37:22.933
I'll board one train and
you the other.

37:22.933 --> 37:25.651
I have a return ticket
to Southampton.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.040
Have a good passage, ma'am.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.398
Thank you.

37:45.271 --> 37:48.227
All aboard! Last call
for Southampton!

37:48.227 --> 37:49.865
All aboard, please!

37:55.421 --> 37:58.138
- Right, you check the Portsmouth train.
- Sir.

37:59.936 --> 38:02.373
- Any couples boarding the Southampton train?
- Several.

38:02.373 --> 38:04.103
Anything about any
of them in particular?

38:04.113 --> 38:06.169
Just one woman travelling
without luggage, sir.

38:06.169 --> 38:10.246
- Why didn't you detain her? - She said she
was joining her husband in Saint-Malo.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.509
Best we sit in different
compartments, until Southampton.

38:26.509 --> 38:27.827
Yeah.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.855
What's Saint-Malo like, Tom?

38:39.855 --> 38:42.173
Intra-Muros.

38:42.173 --> 38:44.410
A citadel - a walled city.

38:45.689 --> 38:49.405
- And everyone's safe within?
- That was always the plan.

38:49.405 --> 38:50.484
Good.

38:58.037 --> 39:00.594
TRAIN WHISTLE SOUNDS

39:09.785 --> 39:11.983
'Look, Winnie, the circles!

39:13.221 --> 39:17.617
'Look at the circles, Winnie!
Ah, they're wonderful.

39:17.617 --> 39:19.894
'That was wonderful!'

39:22.971 --> 39:24.250
What's wrong?

39:38.355 --> 39:40.354
We're getting off at the next stop.

39:44.350 --> 39:45.948
Tell him, Winnie.

39:47.187 --> 39:48.745
Tell him!

39:52.741 --> 39:54.020
It was me.

39:55.179 --> 39:56.857
It was all me.

39:58.935 --> 40:01.468
I put a knife in him and
then I went to seek Tom.

40:01.478 --> 40:02.651
I wasn't even there.

40:02.651 --> 40:05.768
And you think you can escape
this? You harboured her.

40:05.768 --> 40:08.005
And here you are now,
engineering her escape.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.163
And what's your role in
this offence, Inspector?

40:10.163 --> 40:12.162
You provoked her.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.839
- I had to tell her.
- She killed Verloc soon after your visit!

40:14.839 --> 40:18.515
- Yes, SHE killed Verloc!
- You delivered him! You...

40:19.674 --> 40:20.993
..gave her the motivation.

40:20.993 --> 40:22.311
Sit down!

40:26.907 --> 40:29.903
- I'm a policeman.
- And Verloc had made a fool of you.

40:29.903 --> 40:31.503
I wanted Verloc hung, not murdered.

40:31.503 --> 40:33.820
And now you will organise
our deaths, too.

40:36.138 --> 40:38.176
Will that be justice for you?

40:39.974 --> 40:41.571
You saw Stevie's body.

40:43.170 --> 40:45.448
You went through what
was left of him.

40:48.644 --> 40:50.203
Please, let me go.

40:51.202 --> 40:54.519
The law can't punish me any more.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.437
Have pity, for God's sake.

41:01.551 --> 41:03.749
I had his...supper ready...

41:05.907 --> 41:07.266
..as I always did.

41:09.783 --> 41:14.418
I had the knife...laid out
for him, as it always was.

41:23.848 --> 41:26.526
TRAIN COMES TO A HALT

41:39.873 --> 41:41.512
Be careful.

41:48.783 --> 41:51.940
- DISTANT SHOUT:
- All aboard! Southampton train!

41:53.618 --> 41:54.658
He's...

41:56.416 --> 41:57.974
He's let us go.

42:15.556 --> 42:18.713
He's going to overlook the crime.

42:18.713 --> 42:21.471
He doesn't wish our
punishment for it.

42:41.490 --> 42:45.007
Does this mean they'll stop
looking for us altogether?

42:45.007 --> 42:48.883
It means Heat has
compromised himself.

42:48.883 --> 42:50.441
It means that they can't...

42:54.756 --> 42:55.795
My God...

42:57.474 --> 43:02.749
Could you imagine how it would look if
they tried to prosecute us in the future?

43:02.749 --> 43:06.665
The embarrassment his merciful
judgment would cause them?

43:07.784 --> 43:10.061
They'd have to think twice.

43:10.061 --> 43:13.378
We wouldn't even have
to defend ourselves.

43:14.737 --> 43:16.455
But we can't go back.

43:16.455 --> 43:18.333
No, of course not.

43:18.333 --> 43:20.411
Anyway, it doesn't matter, does it?

43:20.411 --> 43:22.808
Because we don't need to go back.

43:22.808 --> 43:25.445
We're going to cross that
channel and never look back.

43:25.445 --> 43:26.484
Never.

43:28.602 --> 43:30.122
You can show us where to run.

43:31.559 --> 43:33.637
You know how to keep
the world at bay.

43:41.549 --> 43:43.508
On neither train?

43:43.508 --> 43:44.986
No, sir.

43:48.742 --> 43:50.860
We had such a case within our grasp.

43:50.860 --> 43:51.899
Verloc.

43:51.899 --> 43:55.496
A foreign conspiracy to
undermine our morale, our law.

43:55.496 --> 43:57.893
A political cause celebre taken away.

43:57.893 --> 44:01.769
Now, the only way to be political about
it is to say it wasn't political at all -

44:01.769 --> 44:04.006
to say we don't have
that kind of violence here.

44:04.006 --> 44:06.005
There's still the Professor, sir.

44:07.244 --> 44:09.481
Just put it out that we're
still looking for her.

44:09.481 --> 44:10.920
The berserk wife of the man

44:10.920 --> 44:14.156
who ran the questionable
little shop on Brett Street.

44:14.156 --> 44:16.753
As for the Professor,
I've got a different plan.

44:16.753 --> 44:18.472
And Ossipon?

44:18.472 --> 44:20.710
A domestic drama, Chief Inspector.

44:25.665 --> 44:27.103
Did you let them go?

44:32.178 --> 44:34.816
Your sense of natural justice
getting the better of the law?

44:35.934 --> 44:37.572
Pragmatism taking over?

44:40.410 --> 44:43.246
I don't think I'm that
kind of policeman, sir.

44:56.793 --> 44:57.872
HE CHUCKLES

44:57.872 --> 44:59.830
Am I such a scourge as that?

45:00.829 --> 45:02.747
Well, I will not be alone!

45:02.747 --> 45:07.622
Others will see what I have done,
and they will follow suit!

45:07.622 --> 45:12.097
- MAN: - Packet to Saint-Malo!
Packet to Saint-Malo!

45:12.097 --> 45:15.693
I'll go and buy the tickets for the
crossing then meet you by the ferry.

45:15.693 --> 45:18.052
Winnie, we have to
be on our guard.

45:18.052 --> 45:19.850
We have to know exactly
what we're doing.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.967
And to know exactly what you want.

45:21.967 --> 45:23.287
I know what I want.

45:50.218 --> 45:52.457
One ticket for Saint-Malo, please.

45:57.372 --> 45:58.410
Thanks.

46:00.689 --> 46:02.806
You're appearing in court
first thing tomorrow.

46:02.806 --> 46:06.922
The man who had to be stopped
from performing a catastrophic act.

46:06.922 --> 46:09.919
And how our brave
policemen managed that.

46:09.919 --> 46:10.958
No.

46:10.958 --> 46:14.354
The state prefers to pretend
that you were no threat at all.

46:14.354 --> 46:18.950
Instead of conspiracy to endanger
life, you'll face a lesser charge -

46:18.950 --> 46:22.227
possessing explosives under
suspicious circumstances.

46:22.227 --> 46:23.745
What?!

46:23.745 --> 46:25.183
What are you talking about?!

46:25.183 --> 46:29.379
You, and the whole Verloc affair,
are to be completely smothered.

46:29.379 --> 46:30.419
Get off!

46:30.419 --> 46:31.897
- Get in.
- Hey!

46:32.935 --> 46:35.412
You're not playing
the game, Inspector!

46:35.412 --> 46:36.932
- Heat!
- DOOR SLAMS

46:36.932 --> 46:38.490
You call me a pest?

46:38.490 --> 46:39.889
YOU'RE the pest!

46:39.889 --> 46:41.966
I'll not be insignificant!

46:41.966 --> 46:44.084
I will not be nothing!

46:44.084 --> 46:46.602
SEA BIRDS CRY

46:54.954 --> 46:55.992
Thank you.

47:05.783 --> 47:06.822
Tom!

47:08.859 --> 47:09.898
Tom!

47:13.135 --> 47:14.334
TOM!

47:18.969 --> 47:20.927
Tom!

47:20.927 --> 47:23.005
Excuse me.
Please, will you... Tom!

47:24.124 --> 47:25.642
Please, don't leave me!

47:26.602 --> 47:28.199
Tom!

47:28.199 --> 47:30.318
Tom, I'm begging you!

47:30.318 --> 47:31.636
I'm begging you, Tom!

47:34.912 --> 47:36.072
Tom!

48:57.949 --> 48:59.827
Are you going by the boat, ma'am?

49:07.978 --> 49:09.137
This way, ma'am.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.679
Take me to Soho!

49:28.957 --> 49:30.516
Take me to a bar.

49:35.151 --> 49:37.189
In this time of turmoil...

49:38.627 --> 49:42.823
..I wish to introduce a young man
who, since his own troubled past,

49:42.823 --> 49:45.261
has learned to be at
peace with himself.

49:45.261 --> 49:46.699
He will give a reading tonight

49:46.699 --> 49:48.897
of what he has been
putting his mind to.

49:48.897 --> 49:49.975
The future.

50:03.641 --> 50:05.520
Are the hopeful...

50:05.520 --> 50:07.798
always to be crushed...

50:07.798 --> 50:11.114
by those who do not have
the courage of that virtue?

50:12.113 --> 50:16.349
Do the strong simply entrench
their strength in society

50:16.349 --> 50:18.187
at the expense of the weak?

50:20.824 --> 50:24.302
Are the imprisoned always
to wait for their release

50:24.302 --> 50:25.820
and their forgiveness?

50:27.019 --> 50:29.136
Is society simply a version...

50:30.176 --> 50:33.172
..of that brutal prison
I spent my last 15 years in?

50:34.251 --> 50:37.808
Do those in chains simply await
the end of their sentence -

50:37.808 --> 50:39.685
their far-from-glorious deliverance?

50:39.685 --> 50:41.364
(Circles...)

50:42.483 --> 50:43.562
(Circles...)

50:44.521 --> 50:48.397
Or is there a better institution
that we can be founded on?

50:49.516 --> 50:53.032
Where justice will open up
its loving arms to the innocent.

50:54.071 --> 50:56.668
Where the strong will help the weak.

50:57.988 --> 50:59.945
None abandoned or forgotten.

51:02.702 --> 51:05.660
Pity and compassion prevailing.

51:07.697 --> 51:11.053
A world of welfare, improvement,

51:11.053 --> 51:13.371
and rehabilitation for all.

51:14.690 --> 51:16.169
Good health...

51:18.127 --> 51:19.445
..true happiness...

51:22.322 --> 51:23.601
..and a good life.

51:45.779 --> 51:47.936
CHATTER

52:23.700 --> 52:25.059
(Ossipon.)

52:30.173 --> 52:31.212
GATE SLAMS

52:38.365 --> 52:40.802
You think you can do this,
the art of pretence?

52:41.761 --> 52:42.801
IN RUSSIAN:

52:57.186 --> 52:58.265
All went well?

52:59.424 --> 53:00.463
He believes me.

53:01.502 --> 53:03.699
Well, you're a very
believable fella.

53:07.296 --> 53:09.973
The Home Secretary told
the Milan Conference

53:09.973 --> 53:13.050
that the British were fully in
control of any anarchist threat,

53:13.050 --> 53:16.286
and no draconian clamp-down
was necessary.

53:16.286 --> 53:18.484
"British values," he stated,

53:18.484 --> 53:21.442
"must be protected from
foreign interference."

53:23.240 --> 53:24.279
Very good, sir.

53:25.518 --> 53:27.395
And how are things at your end?

53:29.194 --> 53:30.433
Very good, sir.

54:10.072 --> 54:11.591
This belonged to Winnie.

54:24.618 --> 54:25.776
What happened?

54:26.305 --> 54:32.173
