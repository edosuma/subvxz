WEBVTT

00:01.389 --> 00:02.271
We're the new guys.

00:02.271 --> 00:04.669
He is officially the grossest
person I've ever met.

00:04.669 --> 00:06.654
–A post-nup?
–My idea.

00:06.654 --> 00:08.990
–She gets my Cigarette boat?
–Only if you cheat.

00:08.990 --> 00:11.476
We met on Facespace.
Today is our first real date.

00:11.476 --> 00:13.710
Denny, it's me,
Bethany.

00:13.710 --> 00:16.827
When you called me a “midget”,
you caused me emotional distress.

00:16.827 --> 00:19.182
Judge Marcia Hooper was
found murdered last night.

00:19.182 --> 00:20.199
We were having an affair.

00:20.199 --> 00:22.101
Could my son actually be arrested?

00:22.101 --> 00:24.795
<i>They wouldn't be hauling him away in
cuffs, if they didn't have the goods on him.</i>

00:24.795 --> 00:27.861
<i>–Maybe I should do it.
–You mean, kill judge Hooper?</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.435
<i>Maybe *he* wants me to kill her.</i>

00:36.365 --> 00:38.149
<i>He just happened to be
at the murder scene.</i>

00:38.149 --> 00:40.728
<i>He just happened to be having
a sweet little affair with the victim.</i>

00:40.728 --> 00:41.529
<i>Oh!</i>

00:41.529 --> 00:45.951
<i>And he just happened to be having a
teenie-weenie little dream about killing her.</i>

00:45.951 --> 00:49.535
<i>I might have been born yesterday, folks,
but I wasn't born last night!</i>

00:49.535 --> 00:52.025
<i>Does anybody really think
he didn't kill her?</i>

00:52.025 --> 00:55.117
My God! We need to gag this woman.

00:55.117 --> 00:56.359
I did once.

00:56.359 --> 00:58.611
Best sexual experience of my life.

00:58.611 --> 00:59.844
What are you talking about?

00:59.844 --> 01:02.439
She covered one of my trials.

01:02.439 --> 01:05.053
She's an animal.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.568
You had sex with this reporter?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.049
Please, Paul.

01:09.049 --> 01:10.966
A gentleman never talks.

01:10.966 --> 01:14.555
<i>Get with the program, folks,
this guy is guilty as sin.</i>

01:14.555 --> 01:15.883
She's an animal.

01:15.883 --> 01:18.282
Danny, she seems to be on the attack.

01:18.282 --> 01:20.556
Did it end badly?

01:20.807 --> 01:22.595
Not for me.

01:29.935 --> 01:32.855
Your honour,
Jeffrey Coho.

01:32.855 --> 01:35.349
I wanted to introduce myself,
convey my deepest—

01:35.349 --> 01:37.161
I know who you are, Mr Coho.

01:37.161 --> 01:40.690
You're the man giving representation
to the person who murdered my wife.

01:40.690 --> 01:43.806
Your Honour, I don't believe
Scott Little took the life of your wife.

01:43.806 --> 01:46.020
I wouldn't defend him
if I thought that he did.

01:46.020 --> 01:49.154
Because you don't defend
guilty people, is that it?

01:49.154 --> 01:51.317
–You disgust me.
–Already?

01:51.317 --> 01:54.630
It's not enough that you tried to secure the
freedom of an adulterer and a murderer—

01:54.630 --> 01:57.249
We both want the real killer
brought to justice here.

01:57.249 --> 01:59.438
It's not Scott Little.

02:00.402 --> 02:02.312
Get out!

02:03.292 --> 02:05.495
If I may ask,

02:05.495 --> 02:09.882
there are rumours that your wife's infidelity
extended significantly beyond my client.

02:09.882 --> 02:11.928
Did you know about this?

02:11.928 --> 02:16.629
How dare you come into this room, and
indict not only my late wife—

02:16.629 --> 02:18.525
–Don't want to be insensitive—
–but also my marriage?

02:18.525 --> 02:20.993
…to the person who killed your wife—

02:20.993 --> 02:22.579
Your client murdered my wife.

02:22.579 --> 02:24.074
–…because I'm told—
–Get out of my chambers!

02:24.074 --> 02:28.316
…that you've told other people
that your marriage was in trouble.

02:28.316 --> 02:32.084
–Who told you that?
–They insisted on anonymity.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.633
Your Honour, please.

02:33.633 --> 02:36.572
We all want to get to
the truth of this.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.808
Jonathan, what are you doing here?

02:38.808 --> 02:40.562
I hope nothing <i>ex parte</i>.

02:40.562 --> 02:43.629
One of my staff saw you come here.
What are you doing?

02:43.629 --> 02:45.780
Trying to find out
who killed Marcia Hooper.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.708
Don't you wanna know?
–Are you kidding me?

02:47.708 --> 02:49.867
Certainly I'm allowed to interview
potential witnesses,

02:49.867 --> 02:52.334
don't tell me the tampering
is already begun.

02:52.334 --> 02:53.612
You are out of your mind.

02:53.612 --> 02:56.845
Yes, how nice to remain
so tightly locked inside yours.

02:56.845 --> 02:58.521
Let me tell you something
right now.

02:58.521 --> 03:00.166
If you start to intimidate
my witnesses—

03:00.166 --> 03:03.480
–Why yours? Do you have dibs?

03:03.824 --> 03:06.579
Is this the way
you wanna play it?

03:06.579 --> 03:08.172
Fine.

03:08.172 --> 03:11.462
Doesn't seem we can
settle this with words.

03:12.361 --> 03:14.669
Maybe we should fight.

03:19.171 --> 03:22.219
Why does everyone in Boston
just stare at me?

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074

03:55.209 --> 03:56.517
Hello.

03:56.517 --> 03:57.770
We're looking for—

03:57.770 --> 03:59.689
Shirley Schmidt!

03:59.689 --> 04:01.823
Missy.
Ivan.

04:01.823 --> 04:03.211
Shirley.

04:03.211 --> 04:05.175
We thought we'd share
our good news.

04:05.175 --> 04:07.890
We're having babies.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.667
Congratulations!

04:10.667 --> 04:12.941
Sally Bowles is pregnant.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.272
We're becoming a family, Shirley.
It's all falling into place.

04:18.272 --> 04:20.550
The happy ending, just like I dreamed!

04:20.550 --> 04:23.706
Yes it is, Sally Bowles!
Yes it is!

04:23.706 --> 04:26.140
Honey, get the slobber towel.

04:27.527 --> 04:31.950
♫ “Cause life is a cabaret
old dog…” ♫

04:31.950 --> 04:33.915
She's not really old.

04:33.915 --> 04:37.818
♫ “Life is a cabaret…” ♫

04:37.818 --> 04:38.955
So I hear.

04:38.955 --> 04:43.000
Ivan, I'm gonna leave you
with the girls while I tinkle.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.121
Certainly, sweetheart.

04:50.172 --> 04:51.845
–God, I hate her.
–Oh, boy.

04:51.845 --> 04:54.246
I tried, this time.

04:54.246 --> 04:57.325
I want to love her.
No, I do love her.

04:57.325 --> 05:00.744
She's just too much. Too
much singing, too much sex.

05:00.744 --> 05:02.547
I'm not a young man anymore.

05:02.547 --> 05:05.219
And, well, there's the fact
that she's stupid.

05:05.219 --> 05:08.157
Ivan, you're choking on
your sixth wife.

05:08.157 --> 05:11.117
Have you ever though about slowing down
and chewing them up more carefully?

05:11.117 --> 05:14.894
Shirley, I know that you
and I left on bad terms,

05:14.894 --> 05:18.340
but if you have even a modicum
of forgiveness in you

05:18.340 --> 05:19.539
I need your help.

05:19.539 --> 05:21.099
But… I'm Missy's attorney…

05:21.099 --> 05:23.934
Exactly. You wrote her post-nup.

05:23.934 --> 05:25.968
Where is the back door?
That's all I'm asking.

05:25.968 --> 05:29.646
...and, as Missy's attorney, I should
be advising her, right now.

05:29.646 --> 05:32.952
My hunch is that she doesn't
even know you want out.

05:32.952 --> 05:35.127
She's been busy decorating
the nursery.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.903
What I can tell you, is…
there is no back door.

05:37.903 --> 05:42.809
That post-nup is as tight as your
soon-to-be-sixth-ex-wife's tushy.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.652
Shirley, you wrote that post-nup
right after you learned that

05:47.652 --> 05:50.299
I was sleeping with you
while still married with Missy.

05:50.299 --> 05:52.010
You must have put in a loophole.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.413
God, that would have been smart!

05:54.413 --> 05:57.744
I must have been too distracted
by that irritating rage.

05:57.744 --> 06:00.406
I'm sorry, Ivan, but that
agreement clearly states that

06:00.406 --> 06:03.985
if you cause a dissolution of
that marriage in any form,

06:03.985 --> 06:07.421
you will lose the bulk of your assets.

06:07.810 --> 06:10.979
Well then, Shirley,
my first love,

06:10.979 --> 06:13.412
it pains me to do this.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.632
You're serving me?

06:16.632 --> 06:19.271
It's the only way I can
nullify the post-nup.

06:19.271 --> 06:21.971
Besides, we'll be
back in court together.

06:21.971 --> 06:23.632
It'll be fun.

06:45.474 --> 06:46.395
What's going on?

06:46.395 --> 06:48.221
Scott, I want you to listen to me.

06:48.221 --> 06:50.274
Just hear me out
for a second, ok?

06:50.274 --> 06:51.431
I'm represented by counsellor.

06:51.431 --> 06:54.078
And if you wish to assert that right,
I will respect it and leave,

06:54.078 --> 06:57.214
but before you do anything,
just hear what I have to say.

06:57.214 --> 07:01.306
You don't have to respond;
in fact, I would advise you not to.

07:04.339 --> 07:09.942
I believe that Jeffrey Coho is placing his
own grandiose interests above yours.

07:09.942 --> 07:11.849
The last thing that
he wants to see here,

07:11.849 --> 07:15.418
is a plea agreement or some deal that
might preempt his 15 minutes.

07:15.418 --> 07:19.797
This is a man who covets,
perhaps thrives on media attention.

07:19.797 --> 07:22.622
He would rather see you
convicted, in my belief,

07:22.622 --> 07:26.262
than give up the chance of
a spectacle that might
maximise his profile.

07:26.262 --> 07:29.320
And Scott, this is a case that
should be put out.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.619
The victim was struck once.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.178
We know this was heat of passion,
we know that you didn't mean to kill her,

07:34.178 --> 07:38.720
but if we go to trial, we will
be charging first degree.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.333
Scott, your semen was there.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.298
You were having an affair with her.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.849
You told your shrink you had
urges to kill her.

07:46.849 --> 07:49.000
There's no way that we lose this one.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.148
Second degree, you could be
out of here in eight years.

07:51.148 --> 07:54.793
First degree, you are looking at life.

07:54.793 --> 07:56.890
The reason I'm in here
telling you all this, is

07:56.890 --> 08:01.770
because someone needs to, and I
suspect that it won't be Jeffrey Coho.

08:01.770 --> 08:06.633
He will never counsel you
to give up his OJ moment.

08:06.633 --> 08:11.530
If his becoming famous means
you spend the rest of your life in jail,

08:11.530 --> 08:13.736
so be it.

08:30.541 --> 08:35.246
Denny Crane! In the flesh.
A lot of flesh.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.845
You look taller.

08:36.845 --> 08:41.172
Oh, I'm just walking on air,
just the thought of suing you.

08:41.172 --> 08:45.196
You said you have an offer?
–Yes, I offer you this.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.899
–It's a depo notice.
–That's right.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.975
I thought, instead of
giving you money,

08:50.975 --> 08:54.189
I would depose and get this complaint
kicked before you even begin.

08:54.189 --> 08:56.539
–Oh, is that what you thought?
–Yeah.

08:56.539 --> 08:58.272
You think you're just gonna
make me go away?

08:58.272 --> 09:00.001
You want a war?
You got a war.

09:00.001 --> 09:01.576
You fat old man.

09:01.576 --> 09:04.857
Let the games begin, small fry.

09:07.445 --> 09:08.709
Well…

09:08.709 --> 09:13.153
certainly his allegations of blackmail
lead to duress and unconscionability,

09:13.153 --> 09:16.212
and if Ivan goes to the press—

09:16.212 --> 09:18.777
I don't think he'll go to the press.
He has his reputation.

09:18.777 --> 09:22.609
Plus, if there's one thing about
Ivan, he doesn't play dirty.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.780
Shirley, Paul.

09:24.780 --> 09:27.325
I believe you've met
my attorney, Alan Shore.

09:27.325 --> 09:29.277
How do you do?

09:29.829 --> 09:30.827
What's going on?

09:30.827 --> 09:34.580
I told Alan my story,
he's agreed to represent me.

09:34.580 --> 09:37.419
–That's ridiculous.
–I'm a fan of ridiculous.

09:37.419 --> 09:40.885
It's also an unwaivable conflict.
We're both attorneys of the same firm.

09:40.885 --> 09:43.299
Oh, please. You used to be
married to Ivan.

09:43.299 --> 09:46.805
Clearly we've already hurdled
the “conflict of interests” bar.

09:46.805 --> 09:48.264
What the hell are you doing?

09:48.264 --> 09:51.105
Shirley, what you did to
my client was unfair.

09:51.105 --> 09:53.810
I'm a man of principle…
or not,

09:53.810 --> 09:56.839
whatever the situation calls for.

09:56.839 --> 09:58.257
Don't be so greedy.

09:58.257 --> 10:00.364
There is enough fun to
go around for everybody.

10:00.364 --> 10:03.291
–I forbid you to represent this man.
–Even better.

10:03.291 --> 10:06.526
Come on, Alan.
Let's prepare.

10:13.409 --> 10:15.314
Uh, this could get ugly.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.294
You think?

10:16.294 --> 10:18.522
I'll inform the executive committee,

10:18.522 --> 10:23.735
and I believe there's one other
person you need to inform.

10:25.884 --> 10:30.519
Missy! Not every marriage
was meant to be.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.802
Not every couple…

10:33.837 --> 10:35.780
The lungs on you!

10:35.780 --> 10:38.558
I learned to project in “Gypsy”.

10:39.904 --> 10:42.841
Missy, I… just want
to assure you that

10:42.841 --> 10:47.011
what happened between Ivan
and me was totally unpremeditated

10:47.011 --> 10:49.771
without malice or intent
to hurt you.

10:49.771 --> 10:52.097
I'm sure just one thing
led to another.

10:52.097 --> 10:54.286
–That's right.
–He's very charming.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.855
He can be.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.807
Oh, Shirley…

10:57.807 --> 10:59.311
Tell me what happened!

10:59.311 --> 11:01.671
–In your marriage?
–In bed with you and Ivan.

11:01.671 --> 11:03.319
–What?
–Tell me.

11:03.319 --> 11:06.345
If I know what you two did,
I'll be able to move past it.

11:06.345 --> 11:09.642
But I have to know exactly
what I'm moving past.

11:09.642 --> 11:11.613
You have to know exactly?

11:11.613 --> 11:15.153
Couldn't you just know...
“—ish”?

11:15.153 --> 11:19.649
You're right. I'll just…
imagine the details.

11:20.137 --> 11:24.611
The important part is that you did the
brave, honourable, honest thing
by telling me.

11:24.611 --> 11:27.398
Well, I still want you
to represent me,

11:27.398 --> 11:31.270
so, what happens next?

11:31.270 --> 11:33.549
We go to court.

11:34.288 --> 11:36.613
You approached the defendent
directly with a plea offer?

11:36.613 --> 11:38.559
I did not go there to
elicit any response.

11:38.559 --> 11:39.632
Why did you go there?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.813
Because I have ethical concerns

11:41.813 --> 11:45.559
as to whether he's getting a fair and true
representation from this megalomaniac.

11:45.559 --> 11:48.573
I consider myself first and foremost
an officer of the court.

11:48.573 --> 11:49.471
You're in contempt.

11:49.471 --> 11:52.410
And if I think a defendant's interests
are being undermined

11:52.410 --> 11:54.952
by a narcissistic lawyer's need
for publicity—

11:54.952 --> 11:57.680
If you ever so much as look at the
defendent again outside of counsel,

11:57.680 --> 12:01.112
I will declare prosecutorial misconduct
and direct a verdict for the defendant.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.837
Your Honour, he's gone
to all my witnesses.

12:02.837 --> 12:05.018
Mr Little is the accused,
one with counsel,

12:05.018 --> 12:07.941
and Mr Coho is entitled
to talk to the witnesses.

12:07.941 --> 12:11.712
–You want to rein me in?
–You're not helping yourself, sir.

12:11.712 --> 12:14.898
I will not let this trial
become about the two of you.

12:14.898 --> 12:19.029
We have a canon of legal ethics
which you will both abide by,

12:19.029 --> 12:22.328
or I will remove you both.

12:22.328 --> 12:24.554
Mr Winant…

12:24.554 --> 12:28.055
I am shocked and appalled.

12:28.354 --> 12:30.442
That is all.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.633
Hey, sorry to turn you in, I
just thought he'd wanna know.

12:49.672 --> 12:51.184
I don't mean to sound impatient,

12:51.184 --> 12:52.796
I've been waiting for
close to two hours.

12:52.796 --> 12:54.112
I just want ten minutes.

12:54.112 --> 12:57.597
As you can see, Mr Coho,
Dr Simon is extremely busy.

12:57.597 --> 13:00.207
I explained you he would not
be able to see you today.

13:00.207 --> 13:02.648
I believe I explained it
to you twice.

13:02.648 --> 13:05.104
It's just, um…

13:05.104 --> 13:11.140
I'm a little upset that Dr Simon would
reveal everything that I told him
in a private session.

13:11.140 --> 13:15.563
I would expect that he would not
repeat everything I told him in
the strictest confidence,

13:15.563 --> 13:19.359
and blab to everyone about
my phobias and sexual problems,

13:19.359 --> 13:21.541
and my most intimate insecurities.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.507
And to print it on his website!

13:23.507 --> 13:25.330
Hold on one second, please.

13:25.330 --> 13:30.053
If I lose a single patient as a result
of that flagrant, outrageous outburst,

13:30.053 --> 13:31.110
I will sue you.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.605
Well, that's gonna have to be
a counter claim, cause

13:32.605 --> 13:34.110
we're probably gonna
sue you first.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.815
I got a client sitting
in a jail cell

13:35.815 --> 13:38.730
because you violated doctor-
-patient communication.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.433
That's priviledged information, pal.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.181
You don't think it was
an agonising thing?

13:42.181 --> 13:44.457
–You think it was legal?
–Yes, it was legal.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.469
If I believe somebody's
life is in danger—

13:46.469 --> 13:49.031
Her life was no longer in danger.
She was dead.

13:49.031 --> 13:52.920
No, she wasn't, not when
I turned the tape over!

13:52.920 --> 13:57.200
–When did you turn it over?
–The afternoon of her death.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.118
You gave the tape to the police
the afternoon of her death?

14:00.118 --> 14:01.686
Well, I…

14:01.686 --> 14:04.354
I didn't give it to the police.

14:04.354 --> 14:06.016
I gave it to her husband.

14:06.016 --> 14:10.153
–What?
–He was here, so I gave it to him.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.706
What do you mean, he was here?

14:15.587 --> 14:18.741
Scott Little was referred
to me by Marcia Hooper,

14:18.741 --> 14:21.666
who I used to treat.

14:21.666 --> 14:26.196
I currently treat her husband, Brian.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.883
OK, before we start,

14:30.883 --> 14:34.049
I want it on the record that I am very
uncomfortable deposing a dwarf.

14:34.049 --> 14:35.515
What's that supposed to mean?

14:35.515 --> 14:36.874
It means I'm uncomfortable.

14:36.874 --> 14:39.884
I don't need any victims' rights groups
picketing outside my condo.

14:39.884 --> 14:43.898
Not to mention the fact you obviously
have deep psychological issues,

14:43.898 --> 14:48.474
to accept any date with a 72-year
old man, let alone… him.

14:48.474 --> 14:50.834
Just ask your questions,
bitchy-doo.

14:50.834 --> 14:53.131
I want that attack
on the record.

14:53.131 --> 14:55.886
Is it your testimony,
Ms Horowitz,

14:55.886 --> 14:58.112
that when two people meet
for romantic purposes,

14:58.112 --> 15:01.211
they are not entitled to judge one
another on physical appearance?

15:01.211 --> 15:02.872
That is not my testimony,

15:02.872 --> 15:07.458
but he is not allowed to call me a midget
in a crowded room full of my peers.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.941
–Oh, other people heard this?
–Yes.

15:09.941 --> 15:12.122
–Name six.
–I didn't get names.

15:12.122 --> 15:14.214
I was too shaken.
–I see.

15:14.214 --> 15:18.309
Do you make room for the possibility
that Mr Crane was shaken?

15:18.309 --> 15:22.884
Did you ever mentioned beforehand
that you were a… little person?

15:22.884 --> 15:26.352
–I said that I'm <i>pétite</i>.
–<i>Pétite</i> ?

15:26.352 --> 15:29.446
That's what I am.
I am <i>pétite</i>.

15:29.446 --> 15:32.148
You two spoke over the internet
for two weeks,

15:32.148 --> 15:35.014
divulging personal,
intimate details.

15:35.014 --> 15:38.266
You leave out the fact that
you're under three feet tall?

15:38.266 --> 15:40.127
Do you think that's honest?

15:40.127 --> 15:43.645
Look at him!
Did I get Mel Gibson?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.170
Maybe I did.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.942
Why didn't you tell him
you were a dwarf?

15:48.942 --> 15:50.800
Because it shouldn't matter.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.849
–It shouldn't matter?
–No, it shouldn't matter.

15:56.609 --> 15:58.888
I can see you're hurt.

15:58.888 --> 16:00.517
Could you be especially hurt
because

16:00.517 --> 16:03.294
this is the first time you felt
you hooked up with someone

16:03.294 --> 16:06.145
where you being a dwarf
didn't matter?

16:06.145 --> 16:08.901
Who are you, Dr Phil?

16:08.901 --> 16:11.463
During the course of
your internet relationship,

16:11.463 --> 16:14.416
did you happen to fall
for my client a little?

16:14.416 --> 16:17.171
–Oh, please.
–Then what's the harm?

16:17.171 --> 16:19.255
You seem pretty thick-skinned.

16:19.255 --> 16:21.548
Sure you faced
your share of ridicule.

16:21.548 --> 16:26.127
Were you really damaged by
a callous remark from a buffoon?

16:26.127 --> 16:30.849
Who are you to say what does
or doesn't humiliate me?

16:30.849 --> 16:34.509
You had high hopes for a relat-
ionship with this man, didn't you?

16:34.509 --> 16:38.431
You daydreamed about going up
against him in law school.

16:38.431 --> 16:43.073
You were in awe of him.
And he rejected you.

17:00.890 --> 17:05.873
My client signed this post-nup under
both emotional and carnal duress.

17:05.873 --> 17:08.006
The terms are onerous,
unconscionable—

17:08.006 --> 17:10.513
We negotiated in good faith, your Honour,
there was nothing onerous about it.

17:10.513 --> 17:13.367
Why would anyone
voluntarily sign away

17:13.367 --> 17:15.832
all of his possessions for
virtually no consideration?

17:15.832 --> 17:18.586
He was under a spell or sort
of orgasmic stupour.

17:18.586 --> 17:20.221
The consideration was
sex with Missy.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.846
Oh, please, he was still
getting it on with you.

17:22.846 --> 17:25.415
–Objection! –Which brings us
right back to unconscionable.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.803
–Mr Shore, that's enough.
–Really?

17:27.803 --> 17:29.433
Then I'd like to call a witness.

17:29.433 --> 17:30.855
–What witness?
–You.

17:30.855 --> 17:31.882
–Me?
–You.

17:31.882 --> 17:34.116
–He can't call opposing counsel.
–Of course I can!

17:34.116 --> 17:37.234
Ms Schmidt is a material witness,
in fact she's *the* material witness.

17:37.234 --> 17:40.744
She's perfectly happy to bellow
her position in open court.

17:40.744 --> 17:44.277
I merely ask that
she do so under oath.

17:46.718 --> 17:48.106
I'll allow it.

17:48.106 --> 17:51.687
Ms Schmidt will take
the stand this afternoon.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.499
Your résumé intact?

17:54.499 --> 17:57.119
Shirley, you're being retaliatory.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.743
It becomes you.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.236
The shrink was treating
the victim and her husband?

18:03.236 --> 18:05.262
He saw that tape, he
didn't tell his wife.

18:05.262 --> 18:07.763
–How can you be sure of that?
–She made love to Scott that night.

18:07.763 --> 18:10.109
But would she have done that
if she knew that he harboured
thoughts of killing her?

18:10.109 --> 18:11.379
Would she not have
said something like,

18:11.379 --> 18:13.125
“hey, what's up with
wanting me dead?”

18:13.125 --> 18:15.762
The husband saw the tape;
he sat on it;

18:15.762 --> 18:18.022
he didn't tell her.

18:18.022 --> 18:19.250
What're you thinking?

18:19.250 --> 18:21.581
I'm thinking, “how perfect
if he wanted to kill her”.

18:21.581 --> 18:25.158
The angry bald little husband,
he waits for Scott to come over,

18:25.158 --> 18:28.376
waits for them to make love,
perfect, he comes home,

18:28.376 --> 18:31.539
whacks her once on the head,
dials 911,

18:31.539 --> 18:33.220
hands over the tape.

18:33.220 --> 18:36.993
The angry, bald little husband's
killed his wife…

18:36.993 --> 18:39.367
just like in the movies.

18:47.509 --> 18:49.928
It's very good news.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.109
–The police know about this?
–They must.

18:52.109 --> 18:55.147
The minute he gave them the tape,
they had to ask when he got it.

18:55.147 --> 18:58.265
Whether they know that Dr Simon
treated him and her,

18:58.265 --> 19:01.893
I don't know. But the truth is,
Scott, it doesn't matter.

19:01.893 --> 19:05.433
Because you are the only one they have
a shot at getting for this murder.

19:05.433 --> 19:06.524
You're the target.

19:06.524 --> 19:10.022
In the end, that tape
speaks for itself.

19:11.609 --> 19:12.639
What's this?

19:12.639 --> 19:14.358
I need you to authorise our access

19:14.358 --> 19:18.155
to Dr Simon's notes and records
concerning your treatment.

19:18.155 --> 19:19.053
Why?

19:19.053 --> 19:21.375
We'll have to be able to put
that footage in a context.

19:21.375 --> 19:24.008
There may be things that
you said that I can use.

19:24.008 --> 19:27.580
I can't know that until
I review it all.

19:33.042 --> 19:36.772
I don't think I want you to see or
read everything I said to my shrink.

19:36.772 --> 19:39.142
Scott, it would be for our eyes only.

19:39.142 --> 19:41.003
There's nothing I said
that's really relevant.

19:41.003 --> 19:44.703
You got to let us
decide that, Scott.

19:46.973 --> 19:48.959
No.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.940
That stuff is priviledged.

19:50.940 --> 19:55.294
Scott, I'm the one vested
with saving your life.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.747
That's not shaping up to be
an easy job, right now.

19:58.747 --> 20:01.172
I don't want you looking
at my therapist's records.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.171
–Scott…
–I said, no!

20:08.450 --> 20:10.039
What do you mean,
she won't drop it?

20:10.039 --> 20:11.207
She's hurt.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.717
My advice is, if you really
want this to go away,

20:13.717 --> 20:16.470
you have to apologise, and
this time make it heartfelt.

20:16.470 --> 20:17.943
–Do you do that?
–Never.

20:17.943 --> 20:20.048
I really appreciate your coming.

20:20.048 --> 20:22.510
I'd like a small sandwich
and some coffee.

20:22.510 --> 20:24.196
Not a problem.

20:24.196 --> 20:26.232
You want to talk to me
about the boy, don't you?

20:26.232 --> 20:28.792
Well, yes, but first I'd like to
talk to you about that night.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.173
–The night she died?
–Yes.

20:31.370 --> 20:34.954
He was there, that night…
the boy.

20:34.954 --> 20:37.026
And did you see them make love?

20:37.026 --> 20:40.395
No, but he used the clicker.

20:40.677 --> 20:41.593
The clicker?

20:41.593 --> 20:44.169
The remote, that opens
the garage door.

20:44.169 --> 20:47.151
She gave all her special
lovers, clickers.

20:47.151 --> 20:50.836
That way they could go undetected
by suspecting neighbours.

20:50.836 --> 20:52.994
But I always knew.

20:52.994 --> 20:56.436
Did you see anybody besides
Scott Little go there that night?

20:56.436 --> 20:58.416
No. He left at nine,

20:58.416 --> 21:01.215
and the husband got home sometime
between ten and eleven.

21:01.215 --> 21:03.310
–Between ten and eleven, you're sure?
–Oh, yes.

21:03.310 --> 21:05.093
I was out with my little dog.

21:05.093 --> 21:08.427
I walk my little dog always
between ten and eleven.

21:08.427 --> 21:10.592
And that's when I saw
the husband go in.

21:10.592 --> 21:12.464
–You're sure it was the husband?
–I am.

21:12.464 --> 21:15.915
He drives some sort of little white
convertible, in an attempt, I suppose,

21:15.915 --> 21:19.322
to seem interesting,
which he's not, not at all.

21:19.322 --> 21:21.725
He's a nasty little man.

21:21.725 --> 21:24.010
He made her get that
restraining order against me,

21:24.010 --> 21:25.847
he made her do it.

21:25.847 --> 21:27.983
Well, you are a peeping tom.

21:27.983 --> 21:29.619
Oh, she liked that.

21:29.619 --> 21:33.833
She liked that I looked.
I was a benign peepie.

21:33.833 --> 21:37.464
The other men who had the clickers,
do you think you might recognise them?

21:37.464 --> 21:39.093
I might.

21:39.093 --> 21:42.224
But he was her favourite…
the boy.

21:42.224 --> 21:46.596
Oh, she liked that boy.

21:49.889 --> 21:51.436
Ms Schmidt,

21:51.436 --> 21:57.042
you and my client, Ivan Tiggs, made love
on the night of May 13th, did you not?

21:57.042 --> 21:59.891
Right out of the gate!

21:59.891 --> 22:01.019
Yes, we did.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.969
–Did he satisfy you completely?
–Objection.

22:02.969 --> 22:04.363
Tell us everything,
leave nothing out.

22:04.363 --> 22:07.048
–Objection!
–What? Oh, yes.

22:07.048 --> 22:09.093
It goes to unconscionability.

22:09.093 --> 22:12.254
If Mr Tiggs pleased her
to such an extent—

22:12.254 --> 22:14.188
Mr Shore.

22:14.188 --> 22:18.217
Mr Tiggs did satisfy you,
didn't he?

22:19.901 --> 22:23.087
I'm under oath.
It wasn't his best work.

22:23.087 --> 22:25.985
Mr Shore, what, pray tell,
is your point?

22:25.985 --> 22:32.726
My point is, the parties were… entwined
and in a val— but still very emotional—

22:32.726 --> 22:36.230
moist physical relationship
even after he remarried,

22:36.230 --> 22:39.120
but you two did get
back together, didn't you?

22:39.120 --> 22:41.358
Only because he told me
he left his wife!

22:41.358 --> 22:45.575
And how did that make you feel, when
you discovered Ivan was still married?

22:45.575 --> 22:48.421
Did the fact that he was unfaithful
hurt me? Yes it did.

22:48.421 --> 22:50.801
Did it surprise me?
No it did not.

22:50.801 --> 22:54.135
After all, he's a womanising
slimeball.

22:54.135 --> 22:58.269
And, consumed of anger, perhaps
vengeance, <i>à soupçon de passion</i>,

22:58.269 --> 23:00.325
you then solicited his wife.

23:00.325 --> 23:02.919
–Is that what you think?
–It's what we both know.

23:02.919 --> 23:04.705
I volunteered to represent her…

23:04.705 --> 23:07.664
Whose idea was the
postnuptual agreement?

23:07.664 --> 23:08.594
Mine.

23:08.594 --> 23:13.531
Post-nups are meant to provide support
after a divorce, not prevent one.

23:13.531 --> 23:15.897
–Who is the lawyer here?
–Certainly not you.

23:15.897 --> 23:18.899
…specifically prepared it
to prevent me from doing

23:18.899 --> 23:20.240
what I had done with you.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.170
–I simply wanted to present you with options.
–Options?

23:23.170 --> 23:25.426
They were no options,
this was blackmail.

23:25.426 --> 23:27.648
Your Honour, he is the party,
not the lawyer!

23:27.648 --> 23:30.552
…80% of my net worth you
also attached my boat,

23:30.552 --> 23:33.425
everything I hold dear.
–You need to reassess your priorities.

23:33.425 --> 23:35.336
Are you going to tell us
under oath that this agreement,

23:35.336 --> 23:37.448
which virtually makes me penniless,

23:37.448 --> 23:40.517
has nothing whatsoever to do
with your personal feelings for me?

23:40.517 --> 23:42.407
–Isn't it exciting?
–Objection!

23:42.407 --> 23:47.207
My relations with you had absolutely
no impact on how I represented my client.

23:47.207 --> 23:50.858
My job as attorney, is to
vigorously represent my clients.

23:50.858 --> 23:53.802
In this case, my client
was Mrs Missy Tiggs.

23:53.802 --> 23:57.200
And as her counsel I drafted
a postnuptual agreement,

23:57.200 --> 24:01.186
which both protected her interests
on a personal and a material level.

24:01.186 --> 24:04.834
You, on the other hand,
represented yourself.

24:04.834 --> 24:08.961
You, as both counsel and
client, had full control of this.

24:08.961 --> 24:12.594
You reviewed all the terms,
you ran it past yourself,

24:12.594 --> 24:14.456
and then you voluntarily signed it.

24:14.456 --> 24:16.821
–Now, wait a minute!
–She is magnificent.

24:16.821 --> 24:19.026
You cheated on your wife,
you deceived me, and

24:19.026 --> 24:22.196
now you want this court to invalidate
a perfectly legal agreement,

24:22.196 --> 24:26.090
because you couldn't keep the vows
you made, when you were married.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.559
Your honour, she's lecturing me.

24:27.559 --> 24:29.647
Duress, unconscionability,
gimme a break.

24:29.647 --> 24:33.211
You're just bored and you
don't wanna lose your stuff.

24:33.550 --> 24:35.798
Enough.

24:43.664 --> 24:46.214
First of all, I wanna thank you
for coming back in.

24:46.214 --> 24:50.323
Secondly, I want to apologise…
eh, in a heartfelt way…

24:50.323 --> 24:51.434
I was wrong.

24:51.434 --> 24:53.773
That's very big of you to admit.

24:53.773 --> 24:56.566
What is it you want?
Money, is it?

24:56.566 --> 24:58.711
You wanna make this right?

24:58.711 --> 25:01.834
I'll settle for your law firm.
–Oh, gee, is that all?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.678
I wanna borrow it and you
for a meeting.

25:04.678 --> 25:07.100
I'm trying to settle a case,
and I'm having a hard time

25:07.100 --> 25:10.006
moving the defendant off his
disgusting lowball offer.

25:10.006 --> 25:12.250
If I had Crane, Poole
& Schmidt behind me,

25:12.250 --> 25:14.962
I think they might budge.

25:17.071 --> 25:19.539
A meeting?

25:19.861 --> 25:21.149
Will I have to talk?

25:21.149 --> 25:24.630
You're much more
impressive when you don't.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.210
One meeting?

25:26.210 --> 25:30.550
In these offices.
I'll call it even.

25:30.550 --> 25:33.548
Not quite.
One condition.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.695
Take off your clothes.
–What?

25:35.695 --> 25:38.126
Oh, come on, that
was the initial plan.

25:38.126 --> 25:42.223
We hit it off, eventually
we get together…

25:42.223 --> 25:43.940
naked…

25:43.940 --> 25:47.386
Take off your clothes. Lemme
see that little package.

25:47.386 --> 25:54.541
You are the most disgusting, vulgar
human being I have ever met.

25:54.851 --> 25:56.557
You're right.

25:56.557 --> 25:58.519
Just the top then?

26:05.772 --> 26:08.325
I promised myself that
I wouldn't lose my composure,

26:08.325 --> 26:10.659
but that's exactly what I did.

26:10.659 --> 26:14.488
Shirley, how many promises
have you kept with yourself

26:14.488 --> 26:17.817
when it comes to Ivan Tiggs?

26:18.461 --> 26:20.414
Look.

26:20.626 --> 26:23.636
<i>No evidence of anybody else there,
not a fibre, a print—</i>

26:23.636 --> 26:26.750
<i>Come on, Mary, who else
could have done this but Scott Little?</i>

26:26.750 --> 26:28.982
<i>Hello, how about the husband?</i>

26:28.982 --> 26:32.227
<i>Spousicide is
the most common cau—</i>

26:32.585 --> 26:34.695
Well, they're playing that,
for all that's worth.

26:34.695 --> 26:37.472
Well, of course they are.
Ratings for the war are slipping.

26:37.472 --> 26:41.522
Shirley, we have to settle
this with Ivan Tiggs.

26:41.743 --> 26:45.433
Let's just see how
Missy's testimony goes.

26:45.625 --> 26:48.024
When a person is told
she needs heart surgery,

26:48.024 --> 26:50.842
she does not expect to be
shipped to India to have it.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.814
You say it like she was forced.

26:52.814 --> 26:54.776
Your client's wife was provided
with an option—

26:54.776 --> 26:55.867
Option?

26:55.867 --> 26:59.492
Pay 18,000 dollars here, or go
to India and have it for free?

26:59.492 --> 27:03.067
Does this sound like a real option
for a low income person, Mr Jovanka?

27:03.067 --> 27:05.902
Look, your client wouldn't even
have had health insurance,

27:05.902 --> 27:08.751
if we couldn't make it affordable—
–She died, Mr Jovanka.

27:08.751 --> 27:11.263
Am I expected to get on a plane
now and go sue Indians?

27:11.263 --> 27:14.608
The death had nothing to do with
malpractice or the quality of care provided.

27:14.608 --> 27:18.174
What about the therapeutic value of
having family around during surgery?

27:18.174 --> 27:20.159
–Look—
–You keep saying “look”.

27:20.159 --> 27:24.201
Heart surgery in the United States
costs $90000 all in,

27:24.201 --> 27:26.391
in India it costs $10000.

27:26.391 --> 27:28.836
With a crisis of health care
coverage in this country,

27:28.836 --> 27:32.840
what responsible HMO wouldn't
incentivise its patients to go abroad?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.616
This woman did not die
because of sub-standard care.

27:36.877 --> 27:39.520
And if you think you're gonna
scare us into settling

27:39.520 --> 27:42.937
by sticking this prop at the table
a week before trial,

27:42.937 --> 27:46.414
you are as mistaken as
you are transparent.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.294
What did you call me?

27:48.294 --> 27:49.745
I mean no disrespect.

27:49.745 --> 27:52.745
Get out of my office before
I throw you out of the window.

27:52.745 --> 27:54.214
Fine.

27:54.441 --> 27:56.754
I'll see you at trial.

27:59.288 --> 28:01.064
Great.

28:02.989 --> 28:05.209
Well, I hope that helped.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.882
See you in court.

28:14.532 --> 28:17.302
When we back somebody,
we back him all of the way.

28:17.302 --> 28:18.297
Really?

28:18.297 --> 28:22.568
You have the full resources
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

28:34.810 --> 28:37.277
I held up my end of the bargain.

28:37.277 --> 28:39.293
I was a good wife.

28:39.293 --> 28:41.627
I came from a modest background,

28:41.627 --> 28:45.432
and this man came, and
he swept me off my feet.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.903
I entered his world, and I became
accustomed to his life style,

28:48.903 --> 28:50.102
adjusted.

28:50.102 --> 28:51.826
Uh, we were only
married nine months.

28:51.826 --> 28:55.474
–I'm a fast adjuster!
–So, what is your life like now?

28:55.474 --> 28:58.522
I'm comfortable, but
my Sally's having puppies,

28:58.522 --> 29:01.472
I have so much more
responsibility now.

29:01.472 --> 29:03.266
I'm going to be a single mother.

29:03.266 --> 29:05.704
Is she having the puppies?

29:05.704 --> 29:07.164
They're show dogs.

29:07.164 --> 29:10.377
How am I supposed to raise
show dogs by myself?

29:10.377 --> 29:13.243
And how do you feel now that
your husband has ended the marriage?

29:13.243 --> 29:15.300
Objection! This is
ludicrous, your Honour.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.954
I'm not going to throw her out
to become a lovable street urchin'!

29:18.954 --> 29:21.666
I'll make a good settlement,
I'll pay her alimony,

29:21.666 --> 29:23.679
and do the good things
I always do.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.723
However, that is not the
agreement you signed.

29:25.723 --> 29:28.585
An agreement you conceived of
and coerced him to sign.

29:28.585 --> 29:32.376
Oh, please, you have never been
coerced into anything in your entire life.

29:32.376 --> 29:36.604
–You don't know everything about me.
–Yes I do.

29:37.107 --> 29:39.113
In my chambers.

29:39.113 --> 29:41.224
Just Ms Schmidt and Mr Tiggs.

29:41.224 --> 29:43.492
Couldn't I come in
and just watch?

29:43.492 --> 29:45.256
No.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.312
I have had it with you two.

29:50.312 --> 29:53.765
If I wanted to see a couple
bickering, I could just go home.

29:53.765 --> 29:56.440
–We are not a couple.
–Right…

29:56.440 --> 29:59.899
You're playing out your personal
problems in my courtroom.

29:59.899 --> 30:03.297
I can hold you in contempt and
recommend you be sanctioned by the bar.

30:03.297 --> 30:06.652
Your Honour, Mr Tiggs has a history
of ruining women's lives.

30:06.652 --> 30:08.127
There's one out there right now.

30:08.127 --> 30:10.105
It's going to take her years
to get over this.

30:10.105 --> 30:12.320
Oh, she'll get over me.
She's like a goldfish.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.430
She has a three-second memory.

30:14.430 --> 30:19.048
You, on the other hand,
can hold on to things for years.

30:19.048 --> 30:20.965
What are you implying?

30:20.965 --> 30:22.964
You didn't make that post-nup to…

30:22.964 --> 30:26.176
to punish me, or to keep me
faithful to Missy.

30:26.176 --> 30:31.577
You did it to keep me away
from you, because you know…

30:31.577 --> 30:34.453
that you can't trust yourself
with me.

30:34.453 --> 30:38.526
It is always about how much people
want you, isn't it Ivan?

30:38.526 --> 30:41.970
No, just about how much
you want me.

30:44.017 --> 30:47.741
Admit it, Shirley.
You're still in love with me.

30:49.383 --> 30:53.436
You're a very disturbed man.

30:56.282 --> 30:58.630
You know how I feel
about you, Shirley.

30:58.630 --> 31:03.297
I'll tell you what. I'll withdraw
the motion and relinquish everything.

31:03.297 --> 31:06.835
My homes, my country club member-
ship, my Cuban cigars…

31:06.835 --> 31:12.484
Missy can have it all, if you agree
to stop fighting yourself…

31:12.484 --> 31:14.621
and give me one more chance.

31:14.621 --> 31:18.295
I've given you
too many chances.

31:23.701 --> 31:25.393
Alright.

31:26.599 --> 31:30.229
I'll relinquish everything
if you go to dinner with me.

31:31.155 --> 31:33.654
I'll take you to Melville's.

31:33.991 --> 31:36.308
But you may have to pay.

31:37.207 --> 31:39.320
Have the rib-eye.

31:47.210 --> 31:49.750
Jeffrey, little <i>probléma</i>.

31:51.122 --> 31:52.433
Hi.

31:52.433 --> 31:55.350
Scott Little's father's in
the prosecution's witness list.

31:55.350 --> 31:58.098
–What do you mean?
–I mean, they're calling our client's father.

31:58.098 --> 32:00.378
Did you know this?
–Our client?

32:00.378 --> 32:03.103
–Is she on this case?
–What can he possibly say?

32:03.103 --> 32:06.153
He's on his way in.
We can go ask him.

32:07.419 --> 32:08.842
We?

32:09.001 --> 32:11.023
Is she on the case?

32:11.023 --> 32:12.720
I don't have to tell you anything.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.095
Mr Schiller, Scott Little
is your son.

32:16.306 --> 32:17.896
Why isn't his name “Schiller”?

32:17.896 --> 32:20.574
She changed it legally
to her maiden name.

32:20.574 --> 32:23.929
Because she's as spiteful
as she is grotesque.

32:23.929 --> 32:25.850
Tell us what you plan
to say, Michael.

32:25.850 --> 32:28.946
I'm not your little dog, I don't
have to obey your commands.

32:28.946 --> 32:31.562
You didn't tell me this
hideous witch would be here.

32:31.562 --> 32:34.618
This is a pathetic attempt
to be relevant in your son's life.

32:34.618 --> 32:36.225
Testifying against him!

32:36.225 --> 32:38.370
You denied my relevance.

32:38.370 --> 32:39.819
You wouldn't even
let me see him!

32:39.819 --> 32:41.653
I was afraid he'd
grow up to be you!

32:41.653 --> 32:44.937
You know, I can't stay here.
Seeing her breathe and speak,

32:44.937 --> 32:47.068
makes it too difficult
to pretend she's dead.

32:47.068 --> 32:49.552
I pretended to be dead
during sex.

32:49.552 --> 32:51.214
You seem to prefer it.

32:51.214 --> 32:53.139
Because you as a corps…

32:53.139 --> 32:55.114
that's something to be
excited about.

32:55.114 --> 32:56.207
Ok.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.647
I'm sure it's lovely
catching up like this,

32:58.647 --> 33:01.103
but, Mr Schiller,
this is your son.

33:01.103 --> 33:02.736
We only have
her word on that.

33:02.736 --> 33:04.669
How can you give
testimony against him?

33:04.669 --> 33:06.577
I'm not; at least,
not on the murder.

33:06.577 --> 33:08.754
Then why is the prosecutor
calling you?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.474
He told me I didn't have
to talk to you, people.

33:10.474 --> 33:12.871
Did he advise you
not to talk to us?

33:12.871 --> 33:13.886
I'm leaving.

33:13.886 --> 33:16.895
You think this makes you
a man, Michael?

33:16.895 --> 33:20.849
You've never been a man.

33:28.311 --> 33:29.629
Ok.

33:29.629 --> 33:31.467
Well, this is exciting.

33:35.171 --> 33:37.633
Bethany, Brad will be
your point man here.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.316
If you need anything,
go to him.

33:39.316 --> 33:41.911
If you're not satisfied…

33:42.229 --> 33:43.804
you come to me.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.627
Thank you.

33:46.514 --> 33:48.591
I'll arrange to have
your files sent over…

33:48.591 --> 33:51.801
set up a command centre.
–Ok.

33:52.690 --> 33:54.671
I wanna thank you
for doing this.

33:54.671 --> 33:57.037
I could never take on
a big HMO myself,

33:57.037 --> 33:59.769
which is why they've
offered me nothing.

33:59.769 --> 34:06.090
Bethany, I wanna apologise
for objectifying you.

34:09.259 --> 34:11.109
The truth is,

34:11.109 --> 34:14.080
I do it to most women.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.989
As…

34:18.257 --> 34:21.331
as I was looking at you,
in that room,

34:21.331 --> 34:25.239
going head to head
with that opposing counsel,

34:25.239 --> 34:31.414
I thought to myself, “I'll bet
there goes a little sexual dynamo”!

34:32.289 --> 34:35.638
Would you like
to try lunch again?

34:37.222 --> 34:40.512
Let's just get through
the trial, Denny.

34:48.592 --> 34:52.617
We're going out to dinner, so…
hopefully we can work it all out.

34:52.617 --> 34:56.281
Excellent. Congratulations,
Shirley.

34:56.701 --> 34:58.413
Alan, why?

34:58.413 --> 35:01.438
I deserve an explanation.

35:01.438 --> 35:03.319
Yes.

35:03.909 --> 35:08.980
First of all, the post-nup was
irrationally lop-sided.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.043
Would be a shame
to see Ivan destitute,

35:11.043 --> 35:15.760
but even more shameful to see
Missy at the helm of a Cigarette boat.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.091
And second of all?

35:18.450 --> 35:20.803
Well…

35:21.574 --> 35:24.145
that's private.

35:24.573 --> 35:30.006
But, something I'll continue to dwell on
as I gaze at that lovely photo of you

35:30.006 --> 35:32.142
that hangs on the wall
of my powder room.

35:32.142 --> 35:33.528
Careful, Alan.

35:33.528 --> 35:38.394
Oh, Shirley, I assure you,
I always take the greatest of care.

35:38.682 --> 35:45.524
But, the thing about the photo is…
as a young woman you were divine.

35:45.524 --> 35:51.547
And in maturity… sublime.

35:54.387 --> 35:56.079
Well, I…

35:56.079 --> 35:59.416
I guess I'm happy
to have made you happy.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.397
Shirley, the truth is,

36:01.397 --> 36:05.097
I only took this case
to be in court with you.

36:05.097 --> 36:06.512
I enjoy your company.

36:06.512 --> 36:12.032
So, if I can't join you on cases,
I'll just have to oppose you.

36:12.032 --> 36:15.732
Or I could just oppose you
right now against the wall.

36:15.732 --> 36:19.273
That would certainly
make me happy.

36:30.205 --> 36:33.655
I was almost there.

36:59.491 --> 37:03.332
Was this lawsuit about
sexual antagonism?

37:06.293 --> 37:08.346
Shirley…

37:08.797 --> 37:13.631
if I thought I could
sexually profit from this,

37:13.631 --> 37:17.161
I would have dragged this thing through
family court for years and years.

37:17.161 --> 37:24.842
This... is just about having
a fine rib-eye... with lovely company.

37:24.842 --> 37:27.251
Shall we leave it at that?

37:28.356 --> 37:30.923
You can't have me back.

37:38.491 --> 37:41.133
Ah… well…

37:41.133 --> 37:45.548
we've both seen this movie, Shirley,
we both know how it ends.

37:45.548 --> 37:49.529
You and I, living
happily ever after.

37:49.529 --> 37:53.096
At least for a few weeks.

38:18.098 --> 38:21.493
I can't love you anymore.

38:45.862 --> 38:48.156
So…

38:48.156 --> 38:54.299
you and Ivan were in it…
for the same thing.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.155
Shirley.

38:56.155 --> 39:01.297
Joanna made me realise it as she
was fitting me for a dress shirt…

39:01.297 --> 39:03.699
Denny, somehow I've grown
rather fond of Shirley.

39:03.699 --> 39:05.840
Well, you can't have her.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.867
Besides, a man doesn't…
eat where his friends…

39:08.867 --> 39:13.538
–‘Schmidts’.
–Exactly. I worked that turf a long time ago.

39:14.154 --> 39:18.850
Let's talk about you, suddenly
co-counselling the woman who sued you.

39:18.850 --> 39:21.889
She's a little powder-cake.

39:21.889 --> 39:23.992
You were once involved with a…

39:23.992 --> 39:25.994
a little person, weren't you?
–I was.

39:25.994 --> 39:27.574
How was she?

39:27.574 --> 39:30.213
As a person… in bed.

39:30.213 --> 39:33.086
Infatigable.

39:33.564 --> 39:37.483
Her nickname…
is “the badger”.

39:38.396 --> 39:41.488
I wonder if she's
a badger in the sack.

39:41.488 --> 39:43.346
Could be painful.

39:43.346 --> 39:46.083
Do you think she'd mind you
talking about her this way?

39:46.083 --> 39:47.936
No idea. Why?

39:47.936 --> 39:50.491
Well, perhaps you should
look down, Denny.

39:50.491 --> 39:52.042
–Do not tell me…
–Oh, yes.

39:52.042 --> 39:54.412
–Oh no…
–Yes.

39:56.555 --> 40:00.922
Having a greater appreciation
for who and... what you are,

40:00.922 --> 40:02.598
I'm not offended.

40:02.598 --> 40:05.109
–You snuck up on me.
–No.

40:05.109 --> 40:07.914
I came to tell you that the court
assigned a trial date.

40:07.914 --> 40:11.031
Opening arguments on Monday.

40:15.566 --> 40:17.839
She got a cute little ass,
doesn't she?

40:17.839 --> 40:19.337
She certainly does.

40:19.337 --> 40:22.699
Here's to all shapes
and sizes, my friend.

40:22.699 --> 40:26.268
And to new and
exciting adventures.

40:26.658 --> 40:29.374
Except for Shirley.
