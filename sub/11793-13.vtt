WEBVTT

00:05.805 --> 00:07.741
   Mikey will be short stop,
   I'm centerfield,

00:07.774 --> 00:09.709
and, of course,
our star pitcher, Nikki.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.211
 Hey, that's a great line-up.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.213
   The ninth grade
   better watch out.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.414
   ( clears throat )

00:14.447 --> 00:16.116
  Didn't you forget someone?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.685
 Nikki, Mikey, me? No.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.388
   ( clears throat )

00:21.421 --> 00:23.289
  Wait a minute,
  we forgot Screech.

00:23.323 --> 00:24.791
 We didn't forget him.

00:24.824 --> 00:27.727
The most important position
hasn't been picked yet.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.295
The foul pole.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.563
The foul pole?

00:30.597 --> 00:31.831
   Think about it, Screech.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.366
   If any of us hits
   you with a ball,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.501
   it's a home run.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.470
 Wow.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.172
Thanks.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.807
( bell rings )

00:40.840 --> 00:44.144
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:44.177 --> 00:46.880
    <i>* I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:49.716
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:49.749 --> 00:53.319

  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:53.353 --> 00:56.856

  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:59.159 --> 01:02.128

01:02.162 --> 01:05.265

01:11.738 --> 01:15.675

01:29.889 --> 01:33.126
   <i>* It's all right</i>

01:33.159 --> 01:35.829
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:35.862 --> 01:39.699
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:46.306 --> 01:50.377
  Carrie: <i>Role models play</i>
  <i>an important part in</i>
  <i>every child's life.</i>

01:50.410 --> 01:51.511
  <i>I had mine.</i>

01:51.544 --> 01:53.346
   <i>My students have theirs.</i>

01:53.380 --> 01:55.148
  <i>Me, I hope.</i>

01:55.181 --> 01:59.285
 <i>And, someday, maybe even</i>
 <i>they'll be role models for</i>
 <i>future generations.</i>

01:59.819 --> 02:01.254
  ( grunts )

02:02.322 --> 02:03.857
<i>But then again,</i>

02:03.890 --> 02:04.924
  <i>maybe not.</i>

02:07.494 --> 02:10.330
  I'm late, I know it,
  I don't have a good excuse,

02:10.363 --> 02:12.732
 but I throw myself
 on the mercy of the teacher.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.601
Tardy.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.869
   But I told you the truth.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.137
 Sit.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.839
Is it too late to lie?

02:21.474 --> 02:25.345
  The world is coming to an end
  tomorrow morning.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.480
   I guess you know
   what that means.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.382
 No homework tonight.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.517
  All right.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.818
 Hey, who is this guy?

02:31.851 --> 02:33.386
 I don't know, but I love him.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.621
  I can't believe it.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.822
  How you doing, kid?

02:36.856 --> 02:37.891
   ( Carrie laughs )

02:38.625 --> 02:40.460
 -Father?
 -No.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.962
   -Boyfriend?
   -No way.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.365
  Identical twins
  separated at birth?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.402
  No.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.405
 Class, I want you to
 meet my eighth grade

02:52.439 --> 02:55.675
 history teacher, Mr.
 James Lyman.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.879
 You know, if it wasn't for his
 inspirational style,

02:59.913 --> 03:02.315
  I might never have
  gone into teaching.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.683
   I was much younger then,

03:03.717 --> 03:04.918
   I didn't know
   what I was doing.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.119
( children chuckling )

03:06.152 --> 03:09.556
Don't believe him,
Mr. Lyman always
knew what he was doing.

03:09.589 --> 03:10.623
  Not always.

03:10.657 --> 03:13.727
 Remember when we were
 discussing Benjamin Franklin

03:13.760 --> 03:16.730
and I went out in the rain
with a kite and a key?

03:16.763 --> 03:18.898
It took me two
weeks to find my hair.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.433
 ( children laughing )

03:20.467 --> 03:23.470
   And another week
   to straighten it.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.638
  What kind of
  a student was she?

03:25.672 --> 03:28.475
 Well, no matter how
 much work I gave her

03:28.508 --> 03:29.809
   or how hard I graded her,

03:29.843 --> 03:32.212
  she never once complained.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.247
 What was the matter with you?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.549
 Did she ever get into trouble?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.685
  There is one time
  that comes to mind.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.453
Oh, Mr. Lyman, I don't
think that's really...

03:40.487 --> 03:43.623
 Now,
 Carrie, this has to be told.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.960
 One day she came to class
 without her homework.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.296
   She swore a space
   alien zapped her

03:50.330 --> 03:52.799
  and stole her assignment
  on Teddy Roosevelt.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.634
  Zack: Oh, good excuse,
  there, Miss Bliss.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.537
  That happened to you, too?

03:57.570 --> 04:00.407
Well,
that's the story I remember
telling Mr. Lyman.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.782
 Hey, a couple of us are
 going over to
 Cosmo's after school.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.250
  You coming?

04:10.283 --> 04:12.952
   Oh, I can't.
   I get baseball practice.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.587
   Oh, that's right.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.389
You're still into that

04:16.423 --> 04:17.690
  jock thing.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.659
   I like playing baseball.

04:19.692 --> 04:23.430
Besides,
give me one good reason
why I shouldn't pitch?

04:23.463 --> 04:24.564
   You'll break your nails.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.899
 I said a good reason.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.301
 Okay.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.271
 You see those
 cute guys over there?

04:31.304 --> 04:32.972
 Yeah, they're on
 the ninth grade team.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.442
  Well, haven't any of
  them asked you out?

04:35.475 --> 04:36.843
  No.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.612
   But I was kinda hoping
   the third baseman would.

04:39.646 --> 04:43.383
 Well, how are you gonna
 get his attention? Hit him in
 the head with a ball?

04:43.416 --> 04:44.484
Look...

04:44.517 --> 04:45.952
  What are you
  trying to tell me?

04:45.985 --> 04:50.757
 Guys don't want to date a girl
 who spits all over
 the pitcher's mound.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.626
 I don't spit all over
 the pitcher's mound.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.495
  I spit on the ball.

04:55.528 --> 04:56.629
  That's even worse.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.598
  Oh, come on, Lisa.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.267
   Guys like girls
   who play sports.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.836
  Don't they?

05:02.869 --> 05:06.039
 Yeah, they like them,
 but they don't want
 to go out with them.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.640
Think about it.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.045
I'm glad you're
enjoying your vacation.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.714
   Actually,
   it's a leave of absence.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.449
   Oh? For how long?

05:16.483 --> 05:19.819
  Until I report to that
  big teachers'
  lounge in the sky.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.456
   You mean you've retired?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.859
   That's what I always
   loved about you, Carrie.

05:25.892 --> 05:26.926
 You're quick.

05:28.795 --> 05:29.829
  Mind if I join you?

05:29.863 --> 05:30.930
Oh, not at all.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.401
 Mr.
 Belding, this is James Lyman.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.836
  He's the man responsible
  for me becoming a teacher.

05:37.570 --> 05:38.772
 You,

05:38.805 --> 05:40.373
 out!

05:40.407 --> 05:42.342
 ( laughing )

05:42.375 --> 05:43.877
   I'm just joking.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.513
 I'll bet you're the principal.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.580
   How did you know?

05:47.614 --> 05:50.450
Who else would
tell a joke like that?

05:50.483 --> 05:51.518
   ( clears throat )

05:51.551 --> 05:53.753
By the way, Miss Bliss,

05:53.787 --> 05:57.323
   I'll be needing your state
   wide curriculum report on
   my desk Friday morning.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.392
   Oh, that's a lot of work.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.428
  The only way I can
  have it by Friday,

06:01.461 --> 06:04.464
 is if I get a little time away
 from my classes this week.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.567
 I don't know if I can find you
 a substitute this fast.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.370
  What about Mr.
  Lyman substituting for me?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.305
 Lyman substitutes for no man.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.808
 Or woman as the case may be.

06:14.841 --> 06:18.745
 Oh, Mr. Lyman,
 won't you do
 this for me, please?

06:18.778 --> 06:19.946
 Well, since it's you.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.548
Belding: Wait a minute.

06:21.581 --> 06:22.916
 With all due respect,

06:22.949 --> 06:24.517
  Miss Bliss, while you've been
  wheeling and dealing,

06:24.551 --> 06:27.420
  you seem to have
  forgotten one little point.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.456
  I am the principal.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.091
 Does he say this all day long?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.793
 The point is,

06:33.827 --> 06:36.696
I'll have to check Mr.
Lyman's qualifications.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.665
Qualifications?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.533
  But I am
  a product of his teaching.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.435
  He taught me
  everything I know.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.506
 Not one word.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.445
 Well,
 if it isn't our star pitcher.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.114
  Look,
  I got to talk to you guys.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.849
  I don't think I can pitch.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.117
 -Are you kidding?
 -No.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.618
 -Are you hurt?
 -No.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.720
 Are you nuts?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.757
 Well, the other two
 questions were taken.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.793
  Look, cute guys just
  don't date girls who spit.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.862
   I would.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.930
 Lisa, you put her up
 to this, didn't you?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.099
  Zack, you overestimate me.

07:13.133 --> 07:17.871
 Do you think that I could ever
 influence this liberated woman
 out of a baseball game?

07:17.904 --> 07:20.340
-Yes.
-You're right, and she
doesn't want to pitch.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.075
  So just stop
  bugging her, okay?

07:22.676 --> 07:23.777
 Okay.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.080
 We don't want her to do
 anything she doesn't wanna do.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.883
  It's just hard to forget,
  last year,

07:29.916 --> 07:31.084
 bottom of the ninth,

07:31.117 --> 07:32.118
   two outs,

07:32.152 --> 07:33.653
  the bases loaded...

07:33.687 --> 07:35.488
   ( both chanting ) Nikki.
   Nikki. Nikki...

07:35.522 --> 07:37.590
 She winds up. There's a pitch!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.726
 Swing and a miss. Strike one.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.594
   Coleman is tired.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.962
   But something
   almost superhuman
   keeps her going.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.064
Another pitch!

07:44.064 --> 07:45.065
  Strike two.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.766
   I used my slider.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.435
 He wasn't even expecting it.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.736
 The crowd is hushed.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.071
   ( both chanting ) Nikki.
   Nikki. Nikki...

07:51.071 --> 07:54.774
  I said the crowd is hushed.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.912
   She winds up, there's
   the pitch, strike three,
   the crowd is going wild.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.381
   ( all cheering )

08:01.414 --> 08:03.049
 But if you
 don't want to pitch.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.385
-Well...
-Nikki Coleman,

08:05.418 --> 08:06.619
  what a guy.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
 Guy?

08:09.022 --> 08:11.558
   I'm not pitching
   and that's final.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.667
 ( both talking indistinctly )

08:22.168 --> 08:23.837
 All right, you guys. Hold it.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.038
Uh-oh, busted.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.474
   Relax,
   Mikey, I got it covered.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.876
  Hall pass.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.544
 All right. Go ahead.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.750
 -Let me check that out.
 -Yeah, sure.
 But don't mess it up.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.485
 This expires in July?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.453
 And Mr. Lyman gave it to you?

08:40.486 --> 08:41.921
Yeah, he said,

08:41.955 --> 08:44.057
   and I will never
   forget his words,

08:44.057 --> 08:45.892
"I trust you."

08:45.925 --> 08:47.560
 He said that?

08:47.594 --> 08:48.628
-To you?
-Yeah.

08:48.661 --> 08:49.796
   I love this guy.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.431
  I can't wait to get
  back to his class.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.599
   Let's go.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.534
   Mylo, what are you doing?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.069
I'm just watching
the drinking fountain.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.472
  I see. Why?

08:59.506 --> 09:02.075
  You know, Mr.
  Belding, to most people
  it's just a water fountain,

09:02.108 --> 09:05.045
but to me it's a liquid
dispensing substation.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.147
An oasis, if you will.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.115
  Every day, hundreds of lips
  seek refreshment

09:09.149 --> 09:11.818
   from that bubbling spring
   and while they wait,

09:11.851 --> 09:12.786
  they talk.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.689
Mylo, I'm not interested
in that sort of thing.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.023
   Oh, yeah?

09:17.023 --> 09:18.825
That's what you think.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.028
  All right, all right, give me
  one solid piece
  of information,

09:22.028 --> 09:24.664
   that you've
   discovered from this, uh,

09:24.698 --> 09:26.833
  substation.

09:26.866 --> 09:31.471
  Miss Bliss' substitute gave
  Zack Morris a hall pass that
  doesn't expire until July.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.139
  July? Schools over in June.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.175
   Exactly.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.045
  Miss Bliss, can I
  speak to you for a moment?

09:39.045 --> 09:40.113
   Yes, Mr. Belding.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.948
  Rumor has it that Mr. Lyman

09:42.048 --> 09:45.752
 gave Zack Morris a hall pass
 that is good through college.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.054
   Where did you hear
   a crazy thing like that?

09:48.054 --> 09:49.155
  A reliable source.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.657
  Anyway,
  that part is not important.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.692
 Oh, Mr. Belding,
 I think it's very important.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.794
I mean, Mr. Lyman's
reputation is at stake.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.895
  ( coughs )

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
 Mylo.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.064
 Who?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.033
 It was Mylo.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.067
 Mylo?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.236
 Well, he said that...

10:03.269 --> 10:07.207
 You know how Mylo
 always seems to know things?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.809
   He was watching
   this oasis and...

10:09.843 --> 10:11.444
   You never saw me.

10:11.478 --> 10:15.715
 Now, listen, before these
 rumors go any further, I think
 you should come with me.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.550
  Now,
  my class has just started.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.019
   Right now,
   I'll bet they're listening

10:19.052 --> 10:21.087
   to the most captivating
   lecture they've ever had.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.188
  They're interested.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.790
   They're involved.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.626
   And they're gone.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.171
  Did you find them?

10:38.204 --> 10:39.873
Mr. Belding, calm down.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.107
  This is as calm as it gets.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.208
  Did you find them?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.309
   Sort of.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.311
 What do you mean, "sort of"?

10:45.345 --> 10:48.815
  Mr. Morton saw them
  scaling the south fence
  and heading into the woods.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.884
 This calls for drastic action.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.552
I know, I know.

10:52.585 --> 10:57.824
 Call the dairy and see if they
 can get an entire class
 picture on a carton of milk.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.928
 Mr. Belding, I'm sure there's
 a perfectly reasonable
 explanation for this.

11:01.961 --> 11:05.565
I'll remember that when
I'm being
grilled by <i>60 Minutes.</i>

11:08.368 --> 11:09.903
  Where are the kids?

11:09.936 --> 11:12.572
   ( snaps ) I knew I
   forgot something.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.674
   They're at lunch.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.744
  Mr. Lyman, where were you?

11:17.777 --> 11:18.945
   We've been worried sick.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.613
   I'll handle this.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.948
  Mr. Lyman, where were you?

11:21.981 --> 11:23.917
   She's been worried sick.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.952
 I took the class for a walk.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.855
I'll bet you
didn't know that many,

11:28.888 --> 11:32.625
  very historical
  events happened
  in and around this school.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.328
Didn't I say there was a
perfectly
reasonable explanation?

11:35.362 --> 11:36.196
 And,

11:36.229 --> 11:38.231
I'll bet you didn't know
General Mencken

11:38.264 --> 11:41.267
fought a decisive battle
against the Sioux,

11:41.301 --> 11:43.103
  right next to the 7-Eleven.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.106
  I never knew that.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.374
 That's great.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.342
  I suppose the next
  thing you're gonna tell me

11:49.376 --> 11:51.945
   is that they
   celebrated their victory
   with a Slurpee.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.014
  You knew that, too?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.282
Carrie.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.851
The man should be on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

11:59.185 --> 12:00.887
  Pardon me.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.957
  But at this public school
  we have radical
  teaching plans.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.659
   They include
   putting the students
   in the classroom

12:06.693 --> 12:08.628
  and having them
  read out of books.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.663
  But this is my way.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.066
  This is how you make
  history come alive.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.169
What Mr. Lyman is
trying to say is that,

12:16.202 --> 12:19.239
although his ways may
seem a bit unorthodox,

12:19.272 --> 12:21.675
   -there is a method to his...
   -Madness?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.743
   I wasn't gonna say that.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.211
 This is all my fault.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.080
  I never told
  Mr. Lyman the rules.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.082
   I'm glad we agree
   on something.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.150
Mr. Belding...

12:30.183 --> 12:31.317
 Look.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.919
 While you two argue,

12:32.952 --> 12:36.423
 I'm going to the cafeteria
 to meet my class.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.092
  I promised I'd have
  dessert with them.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.460
 Explain that to him.

12:44.698 --> 12:47.367
   Mr.
   Lyman, why are you having us
   move our desks?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.136
Because we're
going on another trip.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.705
   I love this guy.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.006
He's got guts.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.875
 All right, everybody.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.410
   Close your eyes.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.281
We're traveling
back to the year 1863.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.050
  The event?

13:04.050 --> 13:06.219
   The turning point
   of the Civil War.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.688
Open your eyes.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.957
 Where are we?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.292
  Gettysburg.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.894
But I don't think I
have the right address.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.198
   All right. Picture this.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.166
   It's a warm summer's day.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.169
   Look over there.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.071
   What do you see?

13:25.105 --> 13:26.439
 A blackboard.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.708
  No, Mikey.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.910
 It's a grove of birch trees,

13:30.944 --> 13:34.080
which conceal General Meade
and the Union troops

13:34.080 --> 13:35.415
 atop Cemetery Ridge.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.817
   And look.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.119
   Look over there.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.820
   Do you see them?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.389
   It's General Lee
   and the Confederate forces

13:42.422 --> 13:45.158
 moving down into that
 grass covered valley.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.826
 And in the distance,

13:46.860 --> 13:49.095
   you can hear the faint drums
   of the Confederacy.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.464
Rat-a-tat-tat.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.466
Rat-a-tat-tat.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.335
   ( drumming rhythmically )

13:57.404 --> 13:58.371
 Upon a hill,

13:58.405 --> 14:01.274
a bugle calls
the Union
soldiers to the ready.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.276
  ( tooting )

14:04.844 --> 14:05.912
Troops,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.448
  grab your weapons.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.286
   They're almost
   upon one another.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.355
 The commander calls, "Ready,

14:15.388 --> 14:17.090
 "aim,

14:17.123 --> 14:18.925
  -"fire!"
  -( exclaims in mock pain )

14:20.360 --> 14:22.062
I've been hit.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.834
 Once before I die...

14:27.867 --> 14:29.069
  Drop dead.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.439
   War is hell, son.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.841
 Let the battle begin!

14:34.874 --> 14:37.310
  ( children laughing,
  shrieking )

14:41.381 --> 14:44.084
   Hey! Cease fire!

14:45.185 --> 14:46.786
   Mr. Lyman: Class,

14:46.820 --> 14:49.456
  you just broke
  one of
  the cardinal rules of war.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.925
Don't kill the teacher.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.259
Samuel.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.995
   Get your corpse up
   back to its desk.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.699
  Mr. Lyman,

14:59.733 --> 15:03.803
 I assume there's a lecture
 that goes along with
 this demonstration.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.038
  You just missed it.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.039
  Guess what?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.140
 The north won again.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.175
   ( all cheering )

15:09.209 --> 15:11.344
   I'm telling you,
   I love this guy.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.114
  Mr. Lyman,

15:14.147 --> 15:16.049
   this is my history class.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.252
 I would prefer it taught
 in a more constructive manner.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.288
  More constructive?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.923
   Well, if you
   really feel like that...

15:23.957 --> 15:25.058
 I do.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.961
 Then the class is all yours.

15:36.803 --> 15:37.704
Nikki.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.306
 You're putting on way
 too much eye shadow.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.975
   ( sighs )

15:42.075 --> 15:45.745
  This stuff was
  obviously invented by men.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.381
  Women wouldn't do
  this to each other.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.250
  You'll get the hang of it.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.252
 The secret to wearing makeup,

15:52.285 --> 15:54.888
is to look like
you're not wearing any.

15:54.921 --> 15:59.092
   But I've got fake nails,
   fake eyelashes
   and fake jewelry.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.561
 Why am I doing this?

16:01.594 --> 16:04.030
   So the third baseman
   can notice the real you.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.301
 How can he notice the real me?

16:08.335 --> 16:10.337
  I can't even
  notice the real me.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.176
   That's not true.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.777
   I know who I am.

16:19.045 --> 16:21.247
I'm a killer southpaw.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.817
 With a wicked slider.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.955
 Lisa,

16:30.056 --> 16:31.391
 I'm pitching.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.061
  Hey, Nikki.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.229
  Hit an all-pitcher.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.099
Thanks.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.805
  ( doorbell rings )

16:55.448 --> 16:56.816
  Mr. Lyman.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.785
   -Carrie.
   -Please come in.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.187
Make yourself at home.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.690
  -This is very nice.
  -Thank you.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
Look what I just found.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.628
  One of my old term papers.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.896
B-plus.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.867
I remember this paper.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.169
  You deserved an A.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.771
  You should have complained.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.838
I did complain.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.910
 Here is an A.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.045
  Happy now?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.846
 Yes.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.349
   But you didn't come
   here to change my grade.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.687
 No, I just thought I'd come by
 and give you
 a chance to apologize.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.690
  -Me apologize?
  -I accept.

17:36.723 --> 17:42.729
   And if I caused you
   any trouble with that
   principal guy, I'm sorry.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.765
  But that is not an apology.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.702
   Mr. Lyman, will you explain
   something for me, please?

17:49.102 --> 17:51.104
 My pleasure.

17:51.137 --> 17:55.775
 How could you give Zack Morris
 a hall pass that doesn't
 expire until July?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.311
  Obviously,

17:58.345 --> 18:02.115
  you didn't look at
  it any closer than
  young Morris did at first.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.216
   The date

18:03.249 --> 18:06.252
  is July 3rd, 1863,

18:06.286 --> 18:08.154
 to be exact.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.724
 That's the day the Battle
 of Gettysburg ended.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.360
  Very good, Carrie.

18:13.393 --> 18:17.030
   And Zack Morris will never
   forget that date either.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.232
 Very good, Mr. Lyman.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.266
  But still,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.035
   there are rules.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.037
Rules?

18:24.037 --> 18:26.439
   Oh, Carrie, not you, too.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.376
   You know I was
   never very big on rules.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.811
   It's learning
   that's important.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.313
It's about kids

18:33.346 --> 18:35.248
 and teachers.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.784
   Well,
   if it's so important to you,
   why are you retiring?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.219
   I'm not retiring.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.054
  They kicked me out.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.322
They did what?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.791
 They call it early retirement,

18:44.824 --> 18:46.059
but they threw me out.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.061
  But why on earth
  would they do that?

18:48.094 --> 18:50.063
Because I'm a dinosaur.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.432
  Because I kept reminding them
  and reminding them

18:52.465 --> 18:54.801
 teaching isn't about budgets

18:54.834 --> 18:56.770
  and requisitions and rules.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.772
 And
 psychologists and SAT scores.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.007
   It's like you said,
   it's about kids.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.242
  And kids need you.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.910
   You can't take
   this lying down.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.378
  You have to fight.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.847
  It's not my battle anymore.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.785
 But it's like you always said,
 the system only works if we
 keep challenging it.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.354
But I'm tired,
I'm tired of fighting.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.790
 You fight them for both of us.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.126
You know what?

19:20.160 --> 19:23.496
 Maybe I'll take my class
 for a history walk tomorrow.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.471
You know, kid?

19:33.039 --> 19:34.741
 You were always my favorite.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.283
And so,
the Battle of Gettysburg

19:43.316 --> 19:45.518
 was the turning point
 in the Civil War.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.454
Any questions?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.856
No, I think you
pretty well covered it.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.057
 Right, Zack,

19:51.057 --> 19:54.427
you're always such a
sponge of
intellectual curiosity.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.463
 And you always
 pitch winning games.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.065
   Well, if you hadn't
   made three errors,
we would've won.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.133
   Details.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.002
  Okay, settle down.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.176
  Mr. Lyman?

20:10.210 --> 20:11.311
 Is that you?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.812
My name

20:12.846 --> 20:14.547
  is Abraham Lincoln.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.449
 Oh...

20:16.483 --> 20:18.985
  Same thing happened
  to my grandfather.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.921
   What are you doing here?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.057
 Seeing a man who's been dead

20:24.090 --> 20:27.260
  over 100 years walking down
  your hall has a way of
  attracting one's attention.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.296
  Four score

20:30.330 --> 20:32.999
 and seven years ago,

20:33.033 --> 20:35.635
our fathers brought
forth on this continent

20:35.669 --> 20:37.537
 a new nation.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.506
 Conceived in liberty,

20:39.539 --> 20:42.108
and dedicated to
the proposition

20:42.142 --> 20:44.878
  that all men
  are created equal.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.113
   Is this the beginning
   of Mr. Lyman's comeback?

20:47.147 --> 20:48.381
  No.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.017
   I think it's his
   farewell address.

20:51.051 --> 20:53.019
   What a way to go.

20:53.053 --> 20:56.389
 Now we are engaged
 in a great civil war.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.258
 Testing whether that nation,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.326
or any nation,

21:00.360 --> 21:02.829
 so conceived or so dedicated,

21:02.862 --> 21:04.531
   can long endure.

21:04.564 --> 21:08.368
   We are met on a great
   battlefield of that war.

21:08.401 --> 21:12.205
We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field

21:12.238 --> 21:15.141
   as a final resting place

21:15.175 --> 21:18.078
   for those who
   gave their lives,

21:18.111 --> 21:20.213
 that that nation might live.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.922
