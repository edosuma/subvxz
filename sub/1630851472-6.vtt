01:19.800 --> 01:22.320
Rob, you're standing on my feet.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.840
I'm not standing on your feet.
You're standing on my feet.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.560
You've done an incredible job, Jo.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.480
People are staring at us.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.720
I bet you love that.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.440
Sash can't move like this.
I like the way you move.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.760
- Are you really as awful as you seem?
- You have the best dreams, Jo.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.320
Mum, I was thinking,
maybe I could come back home?

01:50.400 --> 01:54.440
- To live.
- Really? Really, are you?

01:54.520 --> 01:55.960
I would be so happy.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.600
Finn!

02:10.880 --> 02:12.480
Finn!

02:13.480 --> 02:14.320
Rob?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.440
No, don't...

02:24.640 --> 02:26.240
Promise you'll never leave me.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.640
Rob, please don't do this.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
Rob...

02:48.400 --> 02:49.600
Why?

02:56.320 --> 02:57.600
Why are we back here?

02:57.680 --> 03:00.320
People don't just collapse
for no reason, do they?

03:00.400 --> 03:03.480
None of the tests are telling us
anything we don't already know.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.640
- Which is actually good news.
- How can that be good news?

03:08.720 --> 03:09.640
For Christ's sake!

03:11.320 --> 03:14.880
Have you been allowing yourself
to get stressed?

03:14.960 --> 03:19.160
Because if you have,
that's probably why you fainted.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.400
I think, Jo,

03:22.200 --> 03:25.080
you need to avoid
stressful situations

03:25.160 --> 03:29.880
and give yourself the time
and space you need to recover.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.480
I'm going to suggest we keep you in
under observation.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.120
A couple more nights.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.360
Rob?

03:47.240 --> 03:50.200
Will you get me a nightgown
from home, please?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.400
I can't spend another night
with polyester on.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.280
Yeah. Is there
anything else you need?

03:56.720 --> 04:00.480
Maybe some clothes for the morning
and a washbag, please.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.040
Sorry if I was over the top.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.920
Somebody's gotta stick up for you
with these doctors.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.720
I'll see you later.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.720
- Mrs. Harding? Can I come in?
- Just a minute.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.680
- I am so sorry. I have to go.
- This really isn't a good idea.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.600
So, you can't stop me?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.800
That's right, isn't it?
You can't stop me.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.880
<i>Trust your instincts, Jo.</i>

05:11.800 --> 05:14.280
<i>That's the only way
you'll find out what happened.</i>

05:32.720 --> 05:33.680
Hello?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.240
This is Jo.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.360
I'd really like to talk to you,
and I need a place to stay tonight.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.960
Can you please call me back?

05:45.560 --> 05:46.560
Thank you.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.800
<i>Trust your instincts.</i>

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
Mum?

06:20.840 --> 06:21.960
Jo...

06:27.240 --> 06:28.520
You'd better come in.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.200
I don't remember much from last year.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.280
But you feel very familiar.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.520
- Like you've been in my house.
- That's not true.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.840
I mean like,
he brought you in with him.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.280
Like shit on his shoe?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.160
No.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.960
Like a shadow.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.720
Following him.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.480
What are you doing here, Jo?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.600
You're pregnant, aren't you?

08:04.280 --> 08:08.040
Did you both plan it
so you could be a family?

08:10.440 --> 08:13.320
If we did, it's not working out
very well for me, is it?

08:14.840 --> 08:17.960
He's not here, Jo. He's with you.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.600
But he's also still seeing you.
Isn't he?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.520
He's working out what he wants, yeah.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.440
I think he pushed me down the stairs.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.760
I don't know what was going on
in his mind at the time,

08:40.840 --> 08:45.400
but I found out about all this,
and I believe that he did it.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.200
Right.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.760
All this from the woman
who believes that she went on holiday

08:55.480 --> 08:57.280
to a house that isn't there anymore.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.480
Who locks herself in a room
with an imaginary friend.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.520
Come on, Jo.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.080
Yes, I've seen him a bit stressed.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.600
The odd stapler's
taken one for the team, but...

09:11.200 --> 09:16.560
are you suggesting that he pushed
his wife of 30 years down the stairs?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.200
The woman that he loved...

09:21.520 --> 09:22.560
That he still loves.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.040
It's just not real, Jo.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.200
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Harding.

10:12.280 --> 10:17.120
Your father went walkabout
last night, and he had a fall.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.680
Quame found him on the floor
of the day room.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.800
- Oh my God!
- He was obviously upset, but...

10:25.720 --> 10:26.800
Hi, Dad.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.480
Look at you.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.200
I want to go up in a firework.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.920
You look like you've been in a war.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.040
Don't worry about me.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
No, but I do.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.120
It's Jo we should worry about.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.200
No, Dad.
I am not doing this now. Please.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.400
Won't you just look at me?

11:00.480 --> 11:01.960
It's me.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.640
Johanne, your daughter.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.000
You set fire to a cat.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.600
You did.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.200
It was a toy.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.440
It was a toy cat!

11:21.520 --> 11:22.640
Okay.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.200
Oh, Dad.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.240
What a mess we are, huh?

11:34.080 --> 11:35.200
What a pair.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.600
Utterly broken.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.520
Everything is broken.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.200
I don't know what to do.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.920
The sound of the ocean.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.160
Waves crashing against the shore.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.520
Oh, Dad.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.200
I've always wanted you
to live with me.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.760
Then let's bust out of here, huh?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.920
No.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.920
Not today.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.080
Please.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.960
Just for a few hours.
I'd love to go to the sea.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.880
Do you mean it?

12:25.680 --> 12:28.080
<i>It's just not a good idea,
Mrs. Harding.</i>

12:28.160 --> 12:29.960
I'll have him back by dinner.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.000
You'll get wet, Dad!

12:44.800 --> 12:46.400
Okay.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.440
I know you still miss her.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.040
I don't want a bench when I go.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.440
I don't want people sitting on me.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.600
Okay, Dad.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.600
Turn that thing off, please.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.520
Dad?

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
Dad?

13:37.280 --> 13:39.200
Rob is having an affair.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.280
And...

13:45.600 --> 13:47.200
I'm scared of him, Dad.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.720
I'm scared to go home.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.400
It's difficult for him.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.560
He's married to someone
who's better than he is.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.440
What? But that's not...

14:07.520 --> 14:11.160
- That's not even an excuse.
- Don't shut me down.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.760
- It's not an excuse.
- It is difficult.

14:13.840 --> 14:18.200
It's difficult
when you are with someone who...

14:21.800 --> 14:23.480
can never be happy with you.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.920
We have that in common, me and...

14:30.080 --> 14:31.680
- Rob.
- Rob, yeah.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.600
I want an ice cream.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.320
Proper one.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.240
Not the bloody shit
I get in Alcatraz.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.680
Right.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.560
You want ice cream, and I wanna
shoot something. Let's go.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.600
What's happening, Dad?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.600
That one. I want that one.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.880
I'm shedding my skin.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.200
Jo?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.040
Hey! Hey, Jo.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.320
What's going on?

16:02.120 --> 16:03.440
It's Rob.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.960
I can't stay with him any longer.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.840
Do you like me?

16:18.800 --> 16:21.080
Nick? Do you like me?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.720
- I have a condom.
- No.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.480
- Look, Jo, no.
- Come on, I know you wanna fuck me.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.360
What the fuck, Jo!

16:33.760 --> 16:34.840
This isn't...

16:36.720 --> 16:38.880
This isn't what's been going on here!

16:54.360 --> 16:57.160
Okay, Dad, are you done?
Cup of tea?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.840
That fucking phone.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.040
What's going on?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.800
You swear too much.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.640
It's...

17:26.480 --> 17:30.240
It's just... waiting
for someone to return my call.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.080
<i>And then what? We're on our way?</i>

17:36.360 --> 17:37.560
I think...

17:38.320 --> 17:39.480
I'm going to...

17:39.560 --> 17:40.760
<i>Run away.</i>

17:48.680 --> 17:50.640
I don't know what I'm gonna go.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.840
You need to send me off
in a firework.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.560
What do you say?

18:01.760 --> 18:04.320
Time to go back to Alcatraz?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.720
Going now.
Thank you, I'll see you soon.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.960
Bye, take care.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.920
Jo?

18:19.200 --> 18:22.280
- I need...
- Yep, toilet.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.840
Do you want me to help you?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.480
- Where are we?
- We're in the toilet.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.760
I can't see.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.080
Dad, I'm just here.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.680
Do you want me
to close the door?

18:36.440 --> 18:37.600
Where's Quame?

18:38.440 --> 18:39.960
I need Quame.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.840
We're not at the nursing home, Dad.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.720
Quame's not here.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.320
I can help.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.520
I'll take these.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.520
I'm just gonna...

18:56.880 --> 18:58.360
Okay.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.840
No, what are you doing?

19:00.920 --> 19:03.600
Get away from me!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.120
- Dad, I'm just trying...
- Get the hell away from me!

19:10.200 --> 19:12.640
If you fuck him again,
I'll kill both of you!

19:12.720 --> 19:15.680
Do you understand?
I'll kill both of you!

19:15.760 --> 19:19.520
Do you understand? I'll kill you!

19:20.680 --> 19:22.360
Do you understand? I'll kill you!

19:28.280 --> 19:29.720
You nearly killed her.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.520
What?

19:34.960 --> 19:36.920
I'll fucking kill you both.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.200
You got that?

19:38.280 --> 19:40.640
- I'll kill you.
- Dad, stop!

19:40.720 --> 19:42.200
Dad!

19:49.920 --> 19:51.160
Who?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
Mum.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.960
You nearly killed her.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.880
Where's Susan?

20:35.200 --> 20:38.200
- She'll come in a moment, won't she?
- You're all right, Frank.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.200
That's enough excitement
for one day.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.000
Thanks.

21:18.840 --> 21:23.720
<i>And one day he came home and found
his queen sitting on a rock...</i>

21:25.280 --> 21:28.080
<i>in the arms of a human.</i>

21:28.640 --> 21:29.880
<i>A sailor.</i>

21:33.600 --> 21:38.040
<i>He flew into such a rage
that he drowned the sailor.</i>

21:38.680 --> 21:40.800
<i>And then the Mer-King pushed
his trident</i>

21:40.880 --> 21:43.520
<i>deep into the Mer-Queen's chest.</i>

21:58.440 --> 22:00.280
It was only once.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.160
Once is too often.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.320
Hello?

22:35.080 --> 22:36.880
Thanks for getting back to me.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.000
Yes, I need somewhere to stay,

22:41.080 --> 22:43.440
but I've got to sort
some things out first.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.920
Thank you.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.040
Sash.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.640
Yes, I'm sorry.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.320
Will you guys come by
the house tonight?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.360
Yes, thanks.

22:58.440 --> 22:59.440
Finn.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.320
Just... do it for me, please.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.520
Thank you. All right.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Rob?

23:08.320 --> 23:09.560
Rob, calm down.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.640
I'm coming home.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.520
Where have you been?

24:01.200 --> 24:02.480
What have you been doing?

24:05.760 --> 24:07.480
I've been very busy, Rob.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.720
Putting things together.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.960
Hi, Mum.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.200
My baby.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.640
Mum!

24:22.720 --> 24:25.800
- Hey.
- Hey. I was really scared.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.240
Sash, there are things
I want to say. I need to say.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.280
Okay.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.960
Ah, the prodigal mum.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.920
Shall we...

24:36.000 --> 24:37.080
Okay.

24:38.360 --> 24:42.120
Not just to you, to all of you,
you understand?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and freshen up.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.400
Okay. Do you want me
to stay with you?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.880
- No, I'll be very quick.
- Okay.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.800
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.840
It's been difficult.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.120
I haven't wanted to worry you.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.640
Okay? But your mum's really...

25:34.080 --> 25:35.400
Well, it's not good.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.840
Well, what do you mean?

25:38.600 --> 25:39.800
She's been...

25:41.320 --> 25:42.840
imagining things.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.360
You know, things that are not real.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.080
So...

26:05.240 --> 26:06.600
There are...

26:12.040 --> 26:15.560
There are some things
that you need to know.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.280
Okay.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
<i>Keep calm.</i>

26:21.400 --> 26:23.200
<i>Don't let the engine overheat.</i>

26:24.800 --> 26:25.920
Mum.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.080
Are you okay?

26:35.840 --> 26:38.000
When you've been married
for a long time,

26:38.600 --> 26:40.760
you get these periods
where you plateau

26:40.840 --> 26:42.360
and where you just...

26:46.000 --> 26:48.160
get annoyed
and distant with each other...

26:48.240 --> 26:50.320
Jo, I think you should
drink some water.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.360
I think you're dehydrated.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.640
You forget to...

26:59.240 --> 27:02.760
to find out, you know,
what's going on,

27:02.840 --> 27:05.800
what's really going on
in the other person's life.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.120
- And then...
- Jo.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.920
You come out of it,

27:12.680 --> 27:15.040
and everything goes back to normal.

27:15.120 --> 27:21.280
It's like you've watered
a dying plant just in time, but...

27:24.400 --> 27:25.400
But...

27:28.880 --> 27:30.560
This particular plant...

27:32.840 --> 27:35.200
For this particular plant
it's too late.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.440
This plant is fucked.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.840
Excellent.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.280
Sorry.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
Mum...

27:47.560 --> 27:48.880
What are you saying?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.520
I'm leaving your father.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.000
- What?
- So sorry, kids.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.040
Dad.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.720
- And also...
- Jo.

28:05.280 --> 28:09.280
I think it's been a really long day,
and I think we should leave it.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.320
No.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.920
They need to know...

28:14.160 --> 28:15.360
about Anna.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.840
- Jo. Kids, do you mind?
- He's been seeing someone.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.360
- What?
- Another woman.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.920
Okay. Mum, listen.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.080
This sounds... Just...

28:30.080 --> 28:32.160
- Please.
- You don't believe me?

28:33.960 --> 28:35.800
- You don't believe me?
- Come on.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.920
Jo, come on.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.520
Well, she was leaving you
the night of her accident, so...

28:52.840 --> 28:54.840
Probably is true, isn't it?

28:56.400 --> 28:57.720
What do you mean?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.440
How do you know?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.200
I wasn't allowed to say anything.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.600
Your father's been having an affair
with a woman from work.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.920
Jesus. Jo, it's over.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.720
She's having your baby.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.800
She's pregnant.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.520
The woman.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.080
Anna's her name. She's pregnant.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.920
You're having a baby?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.040
Dad?

29:37.320 --> 29:39.480
- Dad!
- Dad!

29:41.360 --> 29:42.480
Dad!

29:44.480 --> 29:45.680
What the fuck!

29:50.480 --> 29:52.440
I just don't understand, Rob.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.880
What were you going to do
if I remembered?

30:02.120 --> 30:04.200
You're just gonna walk away?

30:12.280 --> 30:13.520
Mum!

30:18.080 --> 30:19.640
I'm so sorry, kids.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.160
I...

30:25.160 --> 30:26.280
We're awful.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.760
I'm just going to speak
to your father.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.720
So, are we gonna finish this?

31:15.080 --> 31:17.040
I didn't recognise you last year.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.840
You were cold, you were distant,
and you abandoned me.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.960
Don't you dare.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.600
Don't blame me
for your fucking wandering dick.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.200
Last year was horrible for me.

31:36.200 --> 31:40.360
When my baby left home,
I started menopause.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.240
All the old ghosts started
to come back,

31:43.320 --> 31:46.200
but I didn't go there this time.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.040
I got sad.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.240
And then I blossomed,

31:52.320 --> 31:55.720
while you, you got
your lover pregnant.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.800
Is that why you pushed me
down the stairs?

31:59.520 --> 32:01.160
To get rid of me?

32:12.320 --> 32:14.800
- You're insane.
- I heard you.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.760
"Oh, she imagines things
that aren't true."

32:21.160 --> 32:23.120
But you've lied to me, over and over,

32:23.200 --> 32:26.400
since the night I landed
at the bottom of those stairs.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.680
I can't prove it...

32:30.080 --> 32:31.880
but I know it.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.280
I know you did it.

32:37.760 --> 32:38.800
When?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.800
When did I ever hurt you?

32:47.080 --> 32:49.640
In all these years
that we've been married,

32:49.720 --> 32:51.400
when did I ever do that?

32:52.680 --> 32:56.160
The truth is, Jo,
you do imagine things.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.720
You don't know what's real
and what isn't.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.360
I fucked up.

33:04.120 --> 33:07.120
I had sex with another person.
I'm the bad guy.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.760
But please don't say that.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.080
Jo, please don't say that. Please!

33:18.000 --> 33:19.200
Please.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.520
Finn?

34:14.240 --> 34:15.360
Sash?

34:26.160 --> 34:27.240
Fuck!

34:34.280 --> 34:35.400
Rob?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.040
I know you're home!

34:55.280 --> 34:56.960
Shit-fuck!

34:57.680 --> 35:01.040
- You okay?
- Tickety-fucking-boo!

35:30.240 --> 35:31.880
Where are they?

35:31.960 --> 35:33.640
I've told them we need to talk.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.720
You don't want me to tell them
what you did to me.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.560
Well, a rational person wouldn't have
brought them here in the first place,

35:46.640 --> 35:49.440
would they,
if I'm so dangerous, but...

35:49.520 --> 35:52.480
you're not particularly rational
at the moment, are you?

36:06.640 --> 36:07.600
Jo!

36:08.920 --> 36:11.120
Jo. I don't want you to leave.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.440
Jo, please.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.040
Goodbye, Rob.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.920
Jo.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.400
Jo, you're right.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.560
Jo, we had an argument that night.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.960
We had a terrible argument.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.600
<i>Tickety-fucking-boo!</i>

36:34.680 --> 36:35.880
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

36:36.400 --> 36:37.960
I wonder why that is?

36:39.200 --> 36:41.680
It's because of this.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.720
This!

36:43.640 --> 36:45.600
Were you going
to say something?

36:45.680 --> 36:49.760
Have you any idea what it's been like
living with you for the last year?

36:49.840 --> 36:51.920
It's been a fucking nightmare!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.240
I told you to get the fuck
out of my house.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.640
Get out of my fucking house!

36:57.520 --> 36:59.720
I said I wasn't going anywhere.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.080
- And we both said some awful things.
<i>- You didn't think to use a condom?</i>

37:04.160 --> 37:05.640
<i>Sometimes we got carried away,</i>

37:05.720 --> 37:09.640
and I didn't have to wait for her
to get fucking wet.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.720
I wanted a second chance,
and you laughed, and you said,

37:13.800 --> 37:16.640
"Fine. If you're not gonna leave,
then I'll go."

37:16.720 --> 37:19.600
You'd put the house on the market
and give me the commission,

37:19.680 --> 37:22.400
because God knows
I needed the business.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.720
Jo! Jo, we can get through this.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.880
I screwed up things with my boss
because of you.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.600
My work. I loved my job.
I loved it more than...

37:33.680 --> 37:34.960
Me?

37:35.760 --> 37:38.320
You wanted a photograph
of the children, that one.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.160
Oh yeah, go on. Take the photograph
of our sweet little kids.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.800
The ones you fucking walked out on.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.720
I was grieving.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.880
You were being selfish!

37:48.960 --> 37:49.880
You reached for it.

37:49.960 --> 37:53.400
<i>You lost your balance,
and you slipped.</i>

38:02.720 --> 38:04.320
You caught me.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.640
I don't understand.

38:13.800 --> 38:18.080
Why say you weren't there?
Why not just tell me I slipped?

38:18.160 --> 38:19.920
Jo, I couldn't hold on to you.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.960
You slipped through my hands,
and I'm sorry.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.400
I'm so sorry.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.720
I'd messed everything up.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.240
But I was scared.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.400
You know, who's gonna believe
that I didn't push you?

38:35.360 --> 38:37.480
But you woke up in hospital.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.760
And you couldn't remember any of it.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.680
And I had a second chance.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.800
You lied to me.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.840
You lied to me all these weeks.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.360
You didn't tell me
my marriage was over.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.120
God.

39:08.080 --> 39:08.880
Jo.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.480
Jo, I tried to save you.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.320
No. You pinned things on my timeline.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.960
You tried to rule me with it,
you arsehole.

39:18.040 --> 39:21.360
I love you. I've always loved you.
We can work through this.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.480
- No, we can't.
- Jo!

39:26.720 --> 39:28.800
- I tried to save you.
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

39:30.720 --> 39:33.000
It's not gonna be easy,
but we can work it out.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.160
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

39:35.240 --> 39:36.600
<i>He tried to save you?</i>

39:36.680 --> 39:38.000
Jo, I love you.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.640
<i>It's bullshit, bullshit, bullshit...</i>

39:41.960 --> 39:43.760
- Jo.
- Come on, think straight!

39:43.840 --> 39:46.160
<i>You know what happens
when things get buried.</i>

39:46.800 --> 39:50.480
<i>Come on, your father used a fucking
fairy-tale to excuse his behaviour.</i>

39:50.560 --> 39:51.760
I'm sorry.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.520
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.880
This is my fault.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.840
This is all my fault.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.640
This is my fault.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.680
<i>- I was grieving!
- You were being selfish!</i>

40:19.600 --> 40:21.440
Lose a baby, get another one.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.800
You know what?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.800
If you're having a boy,
you should call him Lucas.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.360
You let me go.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.160
You let go of me.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.000
Jo, I did a bad thing.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.680
I did a really bad thing,
but I'm not a bad person.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.560
Bad things, Rob?

41:41.680 --> 41:44.120
How many bad things
do you have to do

41:44.200 --> 41:46.880
before it makes you a bad person?

42:54.920 --> 42:56.160
You okay?

42:57.600 --> 42:58.680
Yeah.

43:02.880 --> 43:03.760
Ow!

43:05.160 --> 43:07.760
Sorry. Just checking.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.080
Hello?

43:42.040 --> 43:43.200
Hello?

43:46.440 --> 43:49.080
Mum?

43:49.160 --> 43:50.520
Are you okay?

43:54.440 --> 43:55.560
You all right?

44:47.480 --> 44:48.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.560
I'll have one of those, please.
Blackberry.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.520
Yes. My favourite.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.720
- That was my mum's favourite too.
- Was it?

44:58.040 --> 45:01.800
- Well, I'm here tomorrow too.
- Well, I'm not stopping for long.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
Thanks.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.480
I know you're not real.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.480
I fucking hate mermaids.

46:56.560 --> 46:59.560
