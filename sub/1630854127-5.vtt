WEBVTT

00:12.512 --> 00:14.723
<i>So they got you</i>
<i>on the night shift, huh?</i>

00:15.932 --> 00:16.891
Yep.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.106
Well, don't bring home any chocolate.
I'm watching my figure.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.607
Right.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.947
What do they have you doing there anyway?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.115
Nothing.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.326
I don't think
they're paying you for doing nothing.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.912
Why don't you want to talk about it?

00:38.663 --> 00:41.958
There's nothing to talk about.
I just mix the chocolate all night long.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.711
All right, fine. I was just asking.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.337
<i> So you thought he was beautiful.</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:32.258
<i>And you went to his funeral</i>
<i>even though you had never met him.</i>

01:33.384 --> 01:34.219
<i>Yes.</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:39.182
<i>I, uh, went to</i>
<i>the wake and everything,</i>

01:40.141 --> 01:45.313
<i>and, uh, that's when I decided</i>
<i>I was gonna dig him up.</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:48.149
<i>And what did you plan on doing?</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:54.447
<i>I just wanted to lay with him.</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:58.201
<i>While he was still fresh and just, uh…</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:04.666
<i>hold him.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:13.341
<i>But, uh… it didn't work.</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:27.605
It was March and the ground was too hard,
and it would have taken forever. So…

02:30.400 --> 02:32.277
But I wish I could have dug him up.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.989
I think if I had, then, uh…

02:38.116 --> 02:40.160
I wouldn't have done all the stuff after.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.872
Might've just been the end of it.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.212
Jeff, can you…

02:53.173 --> 02:54.465
Just help us understand a little.

02:54.549 --> 02:58.595
What do you think drove you
to try to dig up a dead body?

02:58.678 --> 03:01.723
You know,
because most people wouldn't do that.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.561
Um…

03:13.234 --> 03:14.319
I guess, uh…

03:18.823 --> 03:20.200
I guess I just…

03:22.118 --> 03:23.953
I hoped that he could be, uh,

03:25.538 --> 03:29.876
somebody that wanted
to see a movie that I wanted to see.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.838
You wanted
to control these guys?

03:36.507 --> 03:37.425
Yeah.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.387
Yeah, 'cause, uh…

03:43.681 --> 03:47.769
well, everybody was always
tellin' me what to do.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.607
You know, my dad, my grandma, my bosses.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.984
The guys were just, uh…

03:57.070 --> 03:59.447
the one thing in my life
that I could control.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.500
So Jeff…

04:11.209 --> 04:14.212
…just going back,
talking about Steven Hicks…

04:16.464 --> 04:18.049
you say that was accidental.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.969
Uh…

04:21.052 --> 04:23.137
Which one was he? Was that the hitchhiker?

04:23.221 --> 04:24.138
Yes.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.976
Okay, 'cause I never
knew their names most of the time.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.104
You <i>should </i>know their names.
These are people you killed.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.738
So, Steven Hicks, the hitchhiker.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.451
That was an accident.

04:46.995 --> 04:51.374
And Steven Tuomi,
he was the one at the, uh, hotel downtown.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.462
Hmm.

04:57.755 --> 04:58.840
Both Steves.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.263
That was an accident as well?

05:08.224 --> 05:09.267
Yeah.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.729
I mean, I didn't mean to kill him.

05:13.563 --> 05:18.026
I didn't want to kill him, but…
I must've.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.363
So yeah, accidental.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.075
Drugged myself too on accident.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.496
So, what changed then?

05:31.372 --> 05:35.001
Because after that,
you started killing people on purpose.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.465
Well…

05:42.425 --> 05:44.927
I started in with the drinking more.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.638
A lot of solitary drinking.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.141
And I just…

05:52.393 --> 05:54.520
started to feel more and more…

05:56.564 --> 05:57.440
alone.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.694
<i>When I was, uh, living with my grandma,</i>

06:01.778 --> 06:04.113
<i>I'd, uh, go to the bars</i>

06:04.947 --> 06:07.700
<i>and I'd pick someone up</i>

06:08.659 --> 06:10.286
and take 'em back to her house.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.808
And I'd drug 'em.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.853
<i>And then I'd take 'em downstairs</i>
<i>to the fruit cellar.</i>

06:36.604 --> 06:39.857
<i>Then I'd strangle them</i>
<i>once they were unconscious</i>

06:40.608 --> 06:43.361
'cause I didn't want them to suffer.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.584
And how many did you kill
at your grandma's house, if you remember?

08:23.252 --> 08:24.253
Uh…

08:31.969 --> 08:32.970
Um…

08:38.726 --> 08:39.810
Three?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.233
<i> Can you describe them?</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:50.738
<i>Well, one guy was Black,</i>

08:51.489 --> 08:53.866
<i>one was a Chicano,</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:58.704
<i>and, uh, another was Indian</i>
<i>or American Indian.</i>

08:59.830 --> 09:04.085
It was just about
if, if I thought that they were beautiful.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.337
I'm not buying that.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.589
You targeted your victims.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.634
Sorry?

09:11.717 --> 09:15.721
You purposefully moved
into an apartment in the Black community.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.308
It's what I could afford, sir.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.937
To an area that was
under-patrolled and underserved,

09:23.020 --> 09:25.022
and you knew that, isn't that right?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.109
Easier to get away with things there,

09:28.192 --> 09:29.610
easier to hunt.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.911
So you get 'em down there, then what?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.497
Um…

09:42.623 --> 09:46.961
Well, at that point, I'd just kinda panic,

09:47.712 --> 09:51.882
you know, like, my grandma
was gonna come down there and find 'em.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.178
But she didn't like
going down those stairs.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.641
So, I knew I was pretty much safe.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.437
But, uh, well,

10:04.520 --> 10:06.480
then she started to notice the smell.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.629
Jeff?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.048
<i>But I figured out how to do it.</i>

10:33.716 --> 10:38.262
<i>You just, uh,</i>
<i>triple-bag the body parts and…</i>

10:38.346 --> 10:39.263
Hey, Grandma.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.098
<i>…throw 'em in the trash and…</i>

10:41.182 --> 10:42.141
Ya winning?

10:46.228 --> 10:47.897
<i>…doesn't smell at all, really.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.321
And Jeff, did you…

10:57.365 --> 11:00.576
You were, what?
Doin' experiments on the bodies?

11:02.036 --> 11:02.953
Yeah.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.877
<i>I'd soak some parts</i>
<i>in acid or, uh,</i>

11:10.753 --> 11:14.382
<i>sometimes just boil 'em</i>
<i>till the flesh came off.</i>

11:14.465 --> 11:15.341
Ah!

11:17.551 --> 11:18.552
The, uh…

11:20.346 --> 11:24.975
You know,
the compulsion had just taken over

11:25.059 --> 11:26.727
completely at that point.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.730
I wasn't even trying to stop it.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.240
Can I just get the electric chair,
you think?

11:43.035 --> 11:46.539
Jeff, did you ever hear voices?

11:47.498 --> 11:48.457
No.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.835
I'm not insane.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.005
It just got really easy, is the problem.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.758
That's why it kept happening.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.970
And your grandma
never suspected anything?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.850
No, she suspected something, just…

12:07.643 --> 12:09.979
not what I was actually doing,
I don't think.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.857
<i>Said she heard a thud one time.</i>

12:12.940 --> 12:14.984
-Jeff?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.236
Go back to bed.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.614
<i>I just told her I fell.</i>

12:25.995 --> 12:29.165
<i>She saw I brought guys home, I think.</i>

12:31.250 --> 12:32.418
<i>But, uh…</i>

12:35.296 --> 12:37.631
<i>she didn't want to accept what that meant.</i>

12:39.508 --> 12:41.135
<i>That you were…</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:48.350
Yeah, I think she just

12:49.310 --> 12:51.937
didn't want to know about my, uh…

12:54.648 --> 12:56.734
lifestyle and whatnot.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.362
But she noticed the smell?

13:02.323 --> 13:03.324
Yeah.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.120
July and August I kinda dreaded
'cause it got so humid down there.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.748
No AC.

13:10.831 --> 13:15.127
Jeff! Something smells real bad
down in the cellar.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.925
It's my taxidermy stuff.
I told you that already.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.182
<i>And for tonight's crime report,</i>

13:28.265 --> 13:29.892
<i>police are asking for the public's help</i>

13:29.975 --> 13:32.311
<i>in finding the people</i>
<i>responsible for a fire</i>

13:32.394 --> 13:33.979
<i>that destroyed a home in Stafford.</i>

13:37.358 --> 13:39.735
Jeff, the smell.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.111
Oh…

13:41.195 --> 13:44.156
Uh, yeah. I seen it.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.159
It's a dead raccoon under the back porch.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.911
Can't get to it.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.247
Don't worry though.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.208
It'll smell for a while,
and then it'll stop.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.260
Why don't you think she did anything?

14:04.343 --> 14:08.013
I mean, that smell, flesh decomposing,

14:08.097 --> 14:10.349
that's a very distinctive smell.

14:10.432 --> 14:14.770
I mean, we are kinda hardwired
to be repulsed by that.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.024
Well, not everybody.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.946
But, uh, yeah, I'm not sure.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.030
I think she, uh…

14:26.490 --> 14:30.411
I think maybe
she was deliberately not seeing it.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.087
<i>But when she found my altar,</i>
<i>she kinda blew her top.</i>

14:41.964 --> 14:44.300
Watch yourself on those stairs!

14:46.468 --> 14:48.846
Oh God! You can't smell that, Jeff?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.389
No.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.765
Oh!

14:52.850 --> 14:54.685
No wonder your nana's upset.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.646
I am too now.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.233
Well, that's what it smells like, Dad.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.653
Animals and stuff.
Taxidermy, it's my hobby.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.197
Unlock it, Jeff.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.411
-I left the key at work, I think.
-Jeff, unlock it.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.462
Let me see.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.469
Oh, yeah.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.931
It is here.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.147
You're the one
that taught me to do it, you know.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.735
And now, you're, like…

16:03.587 --> 16:04.713
Wait a minute.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.426
You use <i>that </i>saw to cut up roadkill?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.764
It's big enough. Yeah.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.225
Like, a woodchuck skull?

16:17.184 --> 16:18.894
Can't do it with a smaller one.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.238
What is that?

16:31.448 --> 16:32.408
What?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.077
What the heck?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.249
What?

16:49.466 --> 16:51.093
What the heck? What is this?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.513
It's just… It's one of my experiments.

16:55.180 --> 17:00.227
I was just using chemicals
to try to melt the flesh and the fur off.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.354
Think that one was a skunk.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.356
Oh, you think so, Jeff?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.568
You think you could have washed
the skunk sludge down the drain better?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.945
Jeez, Jeff!

17:10.654 --> 17:12.364
-Sorry, Dad.
-God!

17:13.657 --> 17:14.950
I'll quit doing it.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.618
I mean it though.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.665
Yeah, I said I'd stop. I'll stop.

17:22.374 --> 17:27.212
Yeah, and, uh, get rid of that comic book
devil stuff too, goddammit.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.590
I know you say
it comes from a movie and all,

17:29.673 --> 17:32.092
but it's just too much for your grandma.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.094
You know that.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.016
Okay. I will.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.477
I promise.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.189
So, you did stop?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.191
Oh, yeah.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.611
For a while, months.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.574
It's funny.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.621
Once I stopped,
that's when I started to get scared.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.375
I just kept waiting to get caught.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.713
You know, every cop car I heard,
I thought they were coming for me.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.218
But, uh… never did.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.513
And I'd watch the news,

18:17.596 --> 18:20.182
but there was never any story
about anybody goin' missing

18:20.265 --> 18:21.141
or anything like that.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.143
And why do you think that was?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.694
So then I thought that, uh,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.656
I wasn't gonna get caught,

18:36.907 --> 18:38.367
if I was careful.

18:39.576 --> 18:44.456
Which made not doing it really hard.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.548
But I did try to not do it.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.217
For, uh…

18:57.427 --> 18:59.012
long periods of time.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.437
This one time…

19:09.314 --> 19:10.858
I really did screw up.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.384
No, man.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.763
Come on. Come on.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.476
Fuck!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.854
Come on, baby.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.568
-What the fuck? Jesus!
-Don't worry, I'm not a cop!

19:55.402 --> 19:56.403
What?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.114
I seen you at the bar.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.825
You need some help?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.077
Uh, no. I'm all right.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.705
Just a… dead battery.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.207
Ugh.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.210
I don't know how you're gonna fix that.
You should let me help you.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.003
-I was just--

20:13.086 --> 20:15.005
My grandma's house
is just around the corner.

20:15.839 --> 20:19.509
We can get my car,
drive back here, and give you a jump.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.970
Okay. Thanks.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.013
Yeah.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.809
Uh, I'll just wait here then.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.730
No, you should come with.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.484
This is a rough area.
You shouldn't just be sitting there.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.738
Come on. Let's grab a taxi
before we get robbed.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.289
Thanks a lot.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.332
You bet.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.375
What's your name?

20:51.458 --> 20:52.334
Jeff.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.003
Thanks, Jeff. I'm Ron.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.130
-You lock it, Ron?
-Yeah.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.466
-Good.
-So you live around here?

20:59.549 --> 21:03.345
Yeah, my grandma's.
Just for… just for now.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.600
Come on in.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.063
Hey, we gotta be quiet though.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.733
Otherwise, the beast will wake up
and start chewing me out.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.907
Come on in.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.413
Here, just make yourself at home.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.292
I gotta find my car keys.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.341
Oh God.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.517
Hey, you wanna see the fruit cellar?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.686
Fruit cellar?

21:52.769 --> 21:57.190
Nah, man. Look, I'm just here because
you said you could give me a hand, okay?

21:58.525 --> 22:01.069
Yeah, I'm gonna help you. I just…

22:02.154 --> 22:04.072
I gotta find my car keys.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.869
Just… Why don't you sit down?
Do you want a drink?

22:08.952 --> 22:12.748
No, I do not. I gotta work in the morning!
If that's not what you had in mind--

22:12.831 --> 22:15.125
Fine, quiet! I'm just being polite.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.961
Seeing if you want something is all,

22:19.212 --> 22:20.255
while you wait.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.054
You want a coffee or something?

22:27.637 --> 22:28.513
Fine.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.141
But make it quick.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.687
Yes, sir. Sanka okay?

22:35.771 --> 22:37.397
Sanka's fine. Thank you.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.024
Don't get quicker than that.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.861
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.836
Is somebody down there with you, Jeff?

23:42.671 --> 23:46.049
I'm fine, Grandma! It's just my friend!

23:46.133 --> 23:48.552
It's very late, Jeff!

23:48.635 --> 23:49.845
Yeah, we know!

23:50.720 --> 23:51.596
Jeez.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.391
You know there's nothing
happening here tonight, right?

23:54.474 --> 23:57.144
Like, I've made that pretty clear.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.188
We're not sleeping together or nothing.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.901
Well,

24:06.278 --> 24:07.279
we'll see.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.950
All right. Fuck you. I'm outta here.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.250
Good luck with that.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.007
You okay?

24:27.674 --> 24:29.759
Yeah, I just

24:30.760 --> 24:32.137
got real light-headed.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.139
Jeff?

24:34.222 --> 24:35.765
I think I'm gonna throw up.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.143
Just sit down a sec.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.770
-There you go. Just relax.

24:40.854 --> 24:41.938
It's okay.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.148
It's okay.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.276
You put
something in that, didn't you?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.862
Jeff!

24:49.613 --> 24:50.572
What?

24:51.072 --> 24:53.575
I think your friend
should go home now, Jeff!

24:54.576 --> 24:56.495
Yeah, we're leaving now, okay?

24:57.412 --> 24:58.371
Good night.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.334
You're so beautiful.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.340
Jeff!

25:09.633 --> 25:10.717
Who is that?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.636
It's just my friend.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.764
I didn't know you had Black friends, Jeff.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.768
Well, it's not the 1920s anymore
or whatever, Grandma.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.478
Yes. I know that.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.688
What's wrong with him?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.066
Nothing.
He just had a little too much to drink.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.068
I'm just trying to sober him up.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.361
You've been drinking.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.487
No, I haven't.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.031
Is he gonna be sick?

25:33.114 --> 25:35.450
Just go back to bed, Grandma.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.745
You should take
that young man to a hospital.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.665
What? He's just a little wasted, Grandma.

25:42.165 --> 25:46.336
I will not have some stranger
dying in my house!

25:46.419 --> 25:49.089
He'll be fine!
Just let him sleep it off! Jeez!

25:49.172 --> 25:50.131
No!

25:51.216 --> 25:54.803
Something is not right here.
I'm calling your father.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.472
Hey! Nobody's calling anybody, okay?

25:58.223 --> 26:01.601
He had a little too much to drink.
He's just gonna sleep it off.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.522
Now, go back to bed.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.655
What are you doing?

26:13.738 --> 26:16.825
I am giving this young man a blanket.

26:16.908 --> 26:21.955
And I am staying down here
and watching him until he wakes up.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.790
You don't have to do that!

26:23.873 --> 26:28.211
And if this young man is sick,
I am taking him to a hospital.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.963
Do you understand?

26:30.714 --> 26:34.134
Well, drinking is what you were doing,
and God knows what else.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.261
-This is fucking unreal!

26:36.344 --> 26:39.139
You watch your mouth, young man!

26:39.222 --> 26:42.892
You want to go up to your room,
fine, but I am staying right here!

26:43.476 --> 26:46.896
And you can bet your sweet bippy
your father's gonna hear about this.

26:56.489 --> 27:00.952
If you're so worried about him, Grandma,
why don't you call an ambulance then?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.834
Oh, I know why.

27:38.531 --> 27:39.532
Hi, buddy.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.161
Let's get you home.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.959
<i>…drink so much until it almost kills you?</i>

27:51.002 --> 27:54.881
Well, if this is your idea of fun,
then I just don't know.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.635
I need some money, Grandma.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.222
He all right?

28:02.305 --> 28:03.390
Yeah, he's fine.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.318
Get home safe.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.656
Where's he going? Sir, will you make sure
this young man gets home all right?

28:19.739 --> 28:21.199
Where does he live?

28:21.282 --> 28:22.534
It's just down in…

28:23.368 --> 28:25.161
It's just by Marquette.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.248
Well, this bus goes down 27th Street,
the whole way.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.544
Yeah, that's what I mean, 27th Street.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.338
Okay, thank you.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.708
Hey, man, it's the end of the line.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.086
This is the end of the line.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.136
-Where am I?
-You OD'd. You're lucky to be alive.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.264
Huh? Hold… Hold on. Uh…

30:09.724 --> 30:11.309
I don't do drugs.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.061
You did last night.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.897
No, I…

30:18.817 --> 30:23.196
Ma'am, a guy I met last night,
he was weird.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.825
He must have
slipped something in my drink.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.328
Dude tried to kill me.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.040
You should talk to the police.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.096
<i>So you're saying</i>
<i>this guy drugged you.</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:49.764
<i>How exactly did he do that?</i>

30:49.848 --> 30:51.808
He put something in my coffee.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.938
I had one drink at the club, officer,
then I take two sips of this coffee,

30:57.021 --> 31:00.066
suddenly the room's spinning,
I can't talk.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.819
So it wasn't caffeine or--?

31:02.902 --> 31:04.195
It was Sanka.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.282
Then I wake up
the next afternoon in a hospital bed.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.159
$200 is missing, my bracelet's gone.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.745
I don't think the 200 bucks
and a bracelet--

31:12.829 --> 31:14.497
I don't care about
getting robbed, officer.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.124
This guy is drugging people.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.834
Look…

31:20.545 --> 31:22.255
I went down to the bathhouses.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.632
They say they know this guy, Jeff.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.175
He's blond.

31:26.259 --> 31:29.721
He isn't allowed in anymore
on account of he's drugging people.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.100
Okay.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.228
Like I said, we'll look into it.

31:39.147 --> 31:43.526
I'm not asking you to look into it.
I'm asking you to go and stop this guy.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.903
I understand.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.573
But stuff like this
is really hard to prove.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.575
Go to this man's house.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.453
Whatever he's using is gonna be there.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.496
-You know where his house is?
-Yes!

31:55.580 --> 31:57.498
I thought I was
gonna die in his living room.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.417
It's on 57th. Uh…

32:00.710 --> 32:03.838
Between Hayes and Lincoln.
I know right where it is.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.591
Well, Jeff,
what do you have to say for yourself?

32:08.051 --> 32:10.470
Honestly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

32:11.220 --> 32:15.058
I met this guy at the bar,
and his car needed a jump,

32:15.892 --> 32:17.769
and he was really drunk.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.230
So I said,
"You know, come back to my house

32:21.314 --> 32:24.067
and try to sober up,
have a cup of coffee."

32:24.150 --> 32:26.903
And he just… He fell asleep on the chair.

32:28.404 --> 32:31.783
Okay, so you're saying he was just drunk?

32:32.408 --> 32:33.576
Yeah.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.119
And had you been drinking?

32:36.079 --> 32:38.915
-I had one beer, but I was fine.
-Jeffrey Dahmer.

32:39.499 --> 32:43.127
What? I got a cop askin' me
what happened, so I'm tellin' him!

32:43.878 --> 32:45.838
I was just trying to do a good thing.

32:45.922 --> 32:49.175
I mean, this guy was wasted.
Trying to drive off in his car.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.135
That's illegal, you know.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.098
If I was to have a look around
in your bedroom,

32:55.181 --> 32:59.394
I wouldn't find any, you know,
like, tranquilizers or whatnot?

33:01.187 --> 33:04.941
No. I… I don't even know
what they would look like.

33:05.483 --> 33:09.445
But sure, I mean, it's right upstairs,
if you wanna come take a look.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.742
He said that you stole some money.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.785
What?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.246
And a bracelet?

33:18.329 --> 33:20.248
No, I didn't.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.627
My grandma was with me the whole time.
Grandma, did I look through his wallet?

33:24.711 --> 33:25.670
No.

33:26.713 --> 33:31.509
He did not, and I was there
the whole time. That is true.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.471
And a bracelet?

33:36.597 --> 33:38.474
Jeez.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.394
I just don't remember
any kind of bracelet.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.479
<i>You've gotta be kidding me.</i>

33:43.563 --> 33:46.357
I know it's disappointing,
but we went to the house.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.152
Talked to him, talked to the grandma.

33:49.235 --> 33:52.321
You know, it's just…
There's two sides to every story.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.322
Jesus.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.491
I mean, he's an odd guy,
I'll give you that.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.452
Been arrested a couple times, but…

33:57.994 --> 33:59.495
But you should know,

33:59.579 --> 34:02.874
getting arrested doesn't suddenly
make you guilty of everything.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.254
I've never been arrested.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.424
Yeah. Okay. Well, you know.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.218
So, let me get this straight…

34:16.304 --> 34:19.390
You're gonna take the word of a white guy
who's got a criminal record

34:19.474 --> 34:23.102
over the word of a Black man
who doesn't have a criminal record.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.855
That's what you're telling me, right?

34:26.439 --> 34:29.442
'Cause I'm telling you
that this man tried to kill me.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.445
And you're saying
there's nothing you can do about that?

34:32.528 --> 34:36.699
Without any evidence,
yes, that's what I'm saying.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.203
-What was he arrested for?
-I can't divulge that information.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.210
Thank you for your time.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.523
Hey! Hey!

35:08.606 --> 35:11.109
-Don't get in that cab!
-What the hell?

35:11.192 --> 35:13.444
You shut your mouth, motherfucker!

35:13.528 --> 35:16.739
Brother, this dude will try to kill you!
He's fucking crazy!

35:20.368 --> 35:21.410
Oh, come on.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.372
What…? You're just gonna…?

36:32.857 --> 36:33.816
Hey!

36:36.194 --> 36:37.904
Come get your 50 dollars.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.615
No!

36:43.451 --> 36:44.619
Oh, come on. What…?

37:56.315 --> 37:57.525
I call ambulance.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.610
I call ambulance.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.503
Step down!

38:30.182 --> 38:31.642
Put that on the ground.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.994
Come with us, please.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.348
<i> Mr. Dahmer, please stand.</i>

39:12.892 --> 39:16.395
To the charge of sexual assault
in the second degree,

39:16.479 --> 39:18.522
you have pled no contest.

39:19.482 --> 39:23.527
Therefore, I hereby sentence you
to one year in the custody

39:23.611 --> 39:26.030
of the Milwaukee County
House of Correction.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.617
Now, Mr. Dahmer,

39:30.326 --> 39:33.996
looking at you right now,
you remind me a lot of my grandson.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.291
Now, he had a problem with alcohol.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.668
But he turned it around.

39:40.336 --> 39:43.214
And now he has a successful car wash.

39:44.298 --> 39:48.386
You are not the kind of guy who belongs
in the correction system, okay?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.263
You need a second chance.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.393
And this is your lucky day
because I'm gonna give it to you.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.979
And on the other side of this, hopefully
you will have learned your lesson

39:59.063 --> 40:00.940
and you'll get your act together.

40:02.066 --> 40:06.737
Now, I see
that you have steady employment.

40:07.321 --> 40:11.742
So the court is willing to grant you
work release of up to 40 hours per week.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.745
When you finish your work,
you report directly back to jail.

40:14.829 --> 40:19.875
And while the court is obliged to inform
your employer of this arrangement,

40:20.376 --> 40:22.795
I'm willing to do you the favor

40:22.878 --> 40:26.924
of leaving out the exact nature
of your… misconduct.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.427
Does that sound fair to you?

40:31.762 --> 40:34.181
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.662
Where are we going?

40:56.745 --> 40:58.080
Grandma's.

40:58.664 --> 41:01.375
We're gonna have
one last dinner together as a family.

41:02.626 --> 41:06.172
And then when you get out,
you're gonna get a place of your own.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.592
Because we're at our wits' end
with you, Jeff.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.178
Our wits' end!

41:15.181 --> 41:18.017
Roast is gonna take
about another ten minutes.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.606
You want another beer, Jeff?

41:24.106 --> 41:25.316
Yeah, thanks.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.319
You know, Jeff,

41:28.402 --> 41:31.071
it was your grandmother
who paid your bail.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.283
Okay? Twenty-five hundred dollars
is a lot for her.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.036
You're gonna be expected to pay that back.

41:40.039 --> 41:43.375
This whole thing was a setup.
All's I was doing was some photography.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.460
Be quiet.

41:45.961 --> 41:47.713
No more hobbies for me, I guess.

41:47.796 --> 41:48.756
Enough.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.822
Where is that box?

42:17.201 --> 42:18.410
What box?

42:18.494 --> 42:19.703
Don't play dumb.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.207
Your grandmother has a box
with all my stuff in it.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.752
Photos, ribbons, all my accomplishments.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.713
And I want you to give it back.

42:30.422 --> 42:31.590
Go get it.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.679
No, she gave it to me.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.806
Goddammit, Jeff!

42:44.562 --> 42:45.437
Get it.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.078
Fine.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.379
Are you gonna follow me?

43:11.046 --> 43:12.131
Yes, I am.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.131
Come on, open it.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.550
I can't. I lost the key.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.552
Jeff, don't lie to me!

43:58.636 --> 44:00.471
I'm not lying. I don't know where it is.

44:00.554 --> 44:03.515
Oh godda--!
There's something bad in there, Jeff.

44:03.599 --> 44:04.975
What is it, pornography?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.602
No. It's just, like, my stuff.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.187
Is it gay pornography, Jeff?

44:08.270 --> 44:12.191
Because all these years, I look under
your mattress, I don't find a <i>Playboy.</i>

44:12.274 --> 44:14.860
Now you're going to jail
for molesting a 13-year-old boy.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.821
No, it's just, like, my stuff,
like baseball cards!

44:17.905 --> 44:19.323
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

44:19.406 --> 44:21.158
Oh fuck,
I'll break the fuckin' thing open!

44:21.241 --> 44:22.743
Come on, Dad! What the heck?

44:49.019 --> 44:51.271
Open this fucking door, Jeff!

44:53.524 --> 44:57.194
Don't break your box, Dad.
I found the key. Right here.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.463
It's just some pornos.

45:17.047 --> 45:19.425
Put 'em in there
so Grandma wouldn't find 'em.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.429
Sorry.

45:24.471 --> 45:25.681
Yeah.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.437
Dinner's ready!

45:34.148 --> 45:37.109
We… we better get down there. Yeah.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.425
Hon, I know you're upset.

46:03.677 --> 46:04.636
It's okay.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.682
No one likes to know that their son's
going to prison in the morning.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.685
I just keep asking myself…

46:13.854 --> 46:15.355
Did I do this to him?

46:16.190 --> 46:18.817
-I mean it. Did I--
-Sweetheart.

46:18.901 --> 46:22.488
I mean, should
I have stayed in that fucking marriage?

46:23.155 --> 46:26.116
Should I have done
more things with him like taxidermy?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.284
He really loved that stuff.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.119
Honey, you can't do that to yourself.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.538
Because I really should've
pushed back harder.

46:31.622 --> 46:35.167
I should've pressed him harder
to find out what was really going on.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.085
You know?

46:37.169 --> 46:41.465
But the truth is,
he made me uncomfortable.

46:42.174 --> 46:43.967
And I really didn't wanna know…

46:58.774 --> 47:00.275
All those red flags. Oh.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.402
God.

47:03.153 --> 47:06.031
And I asked him.
You know, every time I asked him.

47:13.580 --> 47:14.581
Hello?

47:17.876 --> 47:18.961
Discharged?

47:21.380 --> 47:23.048
What the heck happened, Jeff?

47:23.632 --> 47:28.387
I don't know.
Guess they thought I drank too much.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.139
They never really said.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.351
So, what…

47:36.395 --> 47:38.814
What the heck are you doing
with a mannequin, Jeff?

47:39.773 --> 47:41.066
What? Did you steal it?

47:43.652 --> 47:46.780
I just did it on a dare.
Whole thing was just a joke.

47:47.447 --> 47:48.448
Oh.

48:01.044 --> 48:03.589
So, what were you doing
at the State Fair, Jeff?

48:04.423 --> 48:05.841
Exposing yourself?

48:08.927 --> 48:12.764
I was just peeing outside.
I didn't know anyone could see.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.495
Thanks for getting me, Dad.

48:43.545 --> 48:45.130
Why did you molest that boy?

48:45.756 --> 48:47.341
-Jeff?
-I didn't molest him.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.593
All's I did was take photos.

48:49.676 --> 48:50.969
Don't bullshit me.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.138
I'm telling you.
Didn't even know how old he was.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.349
Kid said you molested him.
Why would he lie about that?

48:55.432 --> 48:58.727
I don't know. I don't know why.
All's I did was take some pictures.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.104
I was even gonna pay him.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.399
It was all a setup.

49:05.192 --> 49:08.362
People are out to get me, Dad.
I don't understand it either.

49:16.578 --> 49:17.871
That kid's father…

49:21.041 --> 49:23.168
I can't stop seeing the look in his eye.

49:28.548 --> 49:29.800
He looked right at me.

49:30.801 --> 49:36.139
Jeff Dahmer knew my son was a child.

49:37.349 --> 49:40.644
When he met my son, he asked him

49:41.228 --> 49:44.147
what grade in school he was in.

49:45.399 --> 49:49.027
If my son was not so healthy and athletic,

49:49.861 --> 49:54.116
the drug that this man gave my son
could have killed him--

49:54.199 --> 49:59.037
Mr. Sinthasomphone,
I'm sorry. It's just, uh…

49:59.121 --> 50:01.373
I am having trouble understanding you.

50:01.456 --> 50:04.710
Could one of your children
maybe help us out here?

50:08.171 --> 50:09.172
Thank you.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.603
We are immigrants.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.981
-We work hard.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.484
We take the jobs we can get.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.822
We don't have
the money for an expensive lawyer.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.702
My family,
we're not eating or sleeping--

50:38.785 --> 50:39.828
Okay. Okay.

50:39.911 --> 50:43.665
Maybe if your father would like
to hand his letter to the bailiff,

50:43.749 --> 50:46.001
we can enter it into the record.

50:51.548 --> 50:54.426
Mr. Dahmer, please stand.

50:59.222 --> 51:01.725
To the charge of sexual assault
in the second degree,

51:01.808 --> 51:03.268
you've pled no contest.

51:03.351 --> 51:07.731
Therefore, I hereby sentence you
to one year in the custody

51:07.814 --> 51:10.901
of the Milwaukee County
House of Correction.

51:16.156 --> 51:19.868
<i>Dear Judge Gardner,</i>
<i>I believe very strongly</i>

51:19.951 --> 51:22.954
<i>that my son</i>
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer is an alcoholic.</i>

51:35.050 --> 51:37.803
<i>If he isn't treated,</i>
<i>I have tremendous reservations</i>

51:37.886 --> 51:40.305
<i>about Jeff's chances</i>
<i>when he hits the street.</i>

51:41.556 --> 51:44.142
<i>I've heard of a treatment program</i>

51:44.226 --> 51:47.646
<i>that has had great success</i>
<i>in treating alcoholics</i>

51:47.729 --> 51:51.858
<i>and that Jeff's placement</i>
<i>in such a program</i>

51:51.942 --> 51:53.610
<i>is critical to his future.</i>

51:55.445 --> 51:57.948
You're the one
that likes fucking kids, huh? Huh?

51:58.031 --> 52:01.618
<i>I sincerely hope that you might</i>
<i>intervene in some way to help my son,</i>

52:01.701 --> 52:02.994
<i>whom I love very much.</i>

52:04.830 --> 52:07.541
<i>And for whom</i>
<i>I want a better life.</i>

52:07.624 --> 52:11.419
<i>I feel this may be our last chance</i>
<i>to do something lasting</i>

52:12.295 --> 52:15.632
<i>and that you,</i>
<i>Your Honor, might hold that key.</i>

52:16.800 --> 52:18.927
<i>Sincerely, Lionel Dahmer.</i>

52:57.841 --> 52:59.426
-Hey, Dad.
Hey.

52:59.509 --> 53:00.886
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.931
-Hey, Jeff. Ah. You look great.
-Hey.

53:05.849 --> 53:06.933
You lost some weight.

53:07.475 --> 53:09.603
-Well, that's good to hear.
-Yeah.

53:09.686 --> 53:10.812
Yeah.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.023
Good thing was
I got to lift weights a lot.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.275
And read a lot.

53:15.358 --> 53:18.820
-And going to work every day, that helped.
-Yeah.

53:18.904 --> 53:21.740
But, yeah, been doing good, you know.

53:22.365 --> 53:23.783
Behaving myself.

53:24.784 --> 53:27.954
Great. Just… That's just great.

53:29.789 --> 53:31.333
Um, well,

53:31.416 --> 53:34.461
so you're gonna be staying with
your grandma for a week and that's it.

53:34.544 --> 53:36.546
Then you gotta find
an apartment on your own.

53:36.630 --> 53:39.299
-But Shari and I'll help you with that.
-Okay.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.259
Um…

53:43.303 --> 53:45.055
Jeff, when you were in there, uh…

53:46.306 --> 53:48.183
uh, did anybody help you?

53:49.100 --> 53:50.518
You know, like a psychologist,

53:50.602 --> 53:52.854
or did you talk to anybody,
like a counselor?

53:53.980 --> 53:55.106
About what?

53:55.190 --> 53:56.316
Uh, anything.

53:56.399 --> 53:59.444
Um, you know, alcohol for one or, um…

54:00.237 --> 54:01.696
you know, just how you're…

54:02.364 --> 54:04.491
You know, what's going on inside of you.

54:05.033 --> 54:10.580
Or maybe, um, you know, some guidance
on how you're meant to be, um…

54:11.164 --> 54:14.334
You know…
You know, contribute to society.

54:14.417 --> 54:18.088
I don't know. Just, you know,
stuff I wasn't able to teach you.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.842
No, they just leave you alone in there.

54:25.095 --> 54:29.266
I just kept to myself the whole time.
That was kind of the best part.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.693
Come on. You said
we could stop for hamburgers.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.195
Yeah, um, here.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.490
Why don't you warm up the car?

54:45.573 --> 54:48.076
I'm parked down at the very end.
I'm gonna hit the john.

54:48.159 --> 54:49.244
-Okay.

55:19.024 --> 55:20.317
Well, here it is.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.741
Oh, shoot. Uh…

55:38.251 --> 55:39.085
Sorry.

55:39.669 --> 55:40.962
Trying to learn it.

55:43.548 --> 55:44.883
Just read my lips.

55:47.969 --> 55:49.304
I live here.
