Emma: Maleficent's back.

00:03.767 --> 00:05.110
You should be looking for the author.

00:05.110 --> 00:07.379
He left hidden clues
in some of his works.

00:07.413 --> 00:09.447
August might know something
about it that we don't.

00:09.482 --> 00:11.149
Too bad he isn't around to ask.

00:11.183 --> 00:12.450
But Pinocchio is.

00:12.485 --> 00:14.018
Pinocchio: Everybody
wants me to remember.

00:14.052 --> 00:15.686
I just don't.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.954
You rode a motorcycle.

00:16.989 --> 00:19.157
You wore leather and didn't shave!

00:19.191 --> 00:20.724
<i>He's not trying hard enough.</i>

00:20.759 --> 00:22.059
We want you to go undercover with them

00:22.094 --> 00:23.727
and help us stop their plans.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.562
<i>What exactly did you do to Maleficent?</i>

00:25.597 --> 00:27.231
Because of us...

00:27.266 --> 00:29.667
Maleficent lost her child.

01:01.214 --> 01:02.814
What are you doing here, Regina?

01:02.849 --> 01:04.416
Making it easier for you.

01:04.450 --> 01:07.485
If you want to try to
kill me, I'm right here.

01:09.655 --> 01:12.290
So that's why you think
I'm back... to kill you.

01:12.324 --> 01:14.926
I trapped you underground for 30 years,

01:14.961 --> 01:17.195
and you're not big on forgiveness.

01:17.230 --> 01:18.263
That's true.

01:18.297 --> 01:20.632
But what you did is
nothing in the grand scheme.

01:20.666 --> 01:23.534
There are far worse crimes
that must be answered for.

01:23.569 --> 01:27.171
Careful, darling. She's thick
as thieves with those heroes.

01:27.205 --> 01:28.773
Not by choice.

01:28.807 --> 01:31.542
You know how much I wanted my revenge.

01:31.577 --> 01:35.780
But in this town, I had
to play nice to survive.

01:35.814 --> 01:37.214
Alone...

01:37.249 --> 01:40.885
watching them enjoy, the
happiness I was denied.

01:40.919 --> 01:44.655
If you're planning on destroying
some of that happiness,

01:44.689 --> 01:46.223
I want in.

01:46.258 --> 01:48.725
You can't expect us to believe that.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.727
Of course she doesn't.
That's why she's here.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.562
She wants us to
see she's still one of us.

01:52.597 --> 01:54.165
I am.

01:54.199 --> 01:55.231
Then let's find out.

01:58.235 --> 02:01.204
Are you still a bad girl, Regina?

02:33.102 --> 02:36.171
Well, hurrah for Snow White.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.877

02:45.381 --> 02:48.183
Ooh! I love a touch of irony!

02:48.218 --> 02:48.924
[Giggles]

02:48.924 --> 02:52.627
The day you met Snow White,
she nearly died on a horse.

02:52.661 --> 02:56.864
And yet today, she's the
best rider in all the land.

02:56.899 --> 03:01.101
It's her precious horse that's
won those medals, not her.

03:01.136 --> 03:04.271
Still, good fortune does tend to, uh,

03:04.306 --> 03:05.940
fall in her lap, does it not?

03:05.974 --> 03:07.374
[Sighs]

03:07.409 --> 03:09.143
And you promised to teach me magic

03:09.177 --> 03:11.645
so I can end her charmed life!

03:11.679 --> 03:13.513
Well, I'm teaching you, deary.

03:13.548 --> 03:15.549
Though you sound a bit impatient.

03:15.583 --> 03:19.953
Sneaking out here to read... what is it?

03:19.987 --> 03:21.988
Maleficent's spell book?

03:22.022 --> 03:24.491
I found it in my mother's things.

03:24.525 --> 03:28.294
She can turn into...

03:28.329 --> 03:30.797
A fire-breathing dragon. Yes, yes, yes.

03:30.832 --> 03:32.231
A bit showy if you ask me.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.834
I'm just tired of watching snow grow up.

03:34.868 --> 03:36.735
I am tired of her getting everything,

03:36.770 --> 03:40.806
<i>and I... I want to finally
have my revenge.</i>

03:40.841 --> 03:42.241
[Giggles]

03:42.276 --> 03:43.843
You don't even know what
revenge looks like, deary.

03:43.877 --> 03:45.011
You're right.

03:45.045 --> 03:47.880
All I know what your lessons look like,

03:47.914 --> 03:49.315
and they're taking me nowhere.

03:49.350 --> 03:50.916
Before you start throwing stones,

03:50.951 --> 03:52.485
you might want to look in the mirror.

03:52.519 --> 03:55.387
And I'm not speaking metaphorically.

03:55.421 --> 03:58.323
[Sighs]

04:00.527 --> 04:01.827
What is this place?

04:01.862 --> 04:03.395
Mr. Gold: It's a wasteland.

04:03.429 --> 04:06.698
But years ago, it was a lush forest

04:06.732 --> 04:10.068
till Maleficent burned it down.

04:10.103 --> 04:12.837
Her dragon flame burned so hot

04:12.872 --> 04:15.707
that there's one tree still on fire

04:15.741 --> 04:17.569
half a lifetime later.

04:19.428 --> 04:21.730
Do you know how she did it?

04:21.765 --> 04:22.923
With a powerful magic

04:22.996 --> 04:24.397
that she cultivated

04:24.431 --> 04:27.233
with that most precious commodity... time.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.070
If you ignore the gift of
time and rush into things,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.105
you...

04:33.139 --> 04:34.740
Will never be ready.

04:36.743 --> 04:40.612
Or maybe this is all just excuses,

04:40.646 --> 04:42.894
and you're just not a skilled
enough teacher to show me.

04:42.894 --> 04:44.597
You think she's gonna help you?

04:44.967 --> 04:46.571
I think I'm tired of waiting.

04:46.758 --> 04:48.558
And that is exactly your problem.

04:48.593 --> 04:51.095
Good luck with Maleficent.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.033
[Sighs]

04:57.067 --> 04:58.935
Rumple.

05:24.561 --> 05:25.890
I'm sorry. Regina's doing what?

05:25.890 --> 05:27.042
She's going undercover.

05:27.397 --> 05:28.698
With someone who
could turn into a dragon?

05:28.698 --> 05:30.776
Are you out of your minds?
Why didn't you call me?

05:30.776 --> 05:32.276
There wasn't time.

05:32.310 --> 05:33.243
She told us the plan. That was it.

05:33.278 --> 05:35.646
- You should've told me.
- Mary Margaret: Why?

05:35.681 --> 05:36.977
You really think you
could've stopped her?

05:36.977 --> 05:38.781
I could've helped. I
was a bail-bonds person.

05:38.781 --> 05:40.274
Pretending to be someone
else was part of my job.

05:40.274 --> 05:43.400
I know that, but I really think
Regina can take care of herself.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.415
I hope you're right.

05:44.415 --> 05:45.423
When is she supposed to check in?

05:48.704 --> 05:49.432
Mom? Dad?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.766
When is she supposed to check in?

05:52.167 --> 05:54.269
About an hour ago.

05:59.008 --> 06:00.141
[Tires squeal]

06:01.476 --> 06:04.719
Now, will someone please tell
me where the hell we're going?

06:04.719 --> 06:06.452
Want me to spoil all the fun?

06:06.487 --> 06:09.923
- You'll find out soon enough.
- Fine.

06:09.957 --> 06:12.435
But out of... Professional curiosity,

06:12.435 --> 06:15.271
I have to know, just...

06:15.523 --> 06:18.025
<i>How did you two resurrect her?</i>

06:18.060 --> 06:18.960
First things first.

don't exactly trust you.

06:43.037 --> 06:44.314
Playing my favorite game.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.356
It's called "don't be a hero."

06:46.391 --> 06:50.427
First one that saves us loses.

06:50.461 --> 06:51.461
You got to be kidding me.

06:51.496 --> 06:55.132
You don't like it, then
just poof us out of here.

07:24.795 --> 07:27.263
Come on. Don't look at me like that.

07:27.297 --> 07:30.100
I told you she'd gone soft, Mal. Pay up.

07:31.268 --> 07:34.137
She's just Rusty. It doesn't mean anything.

07:34.171 --> 07:36.171
What do you think?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.274
Are we playing too rough for you?

07:38.308 --> 07:40.443
I think we should get out of here...

07:42.779 --> 07:47.416
and go find some real trouble.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.258
[Footsteps approaching]

08:03.390 --> 08:04.511
Hey.

08:05.306 --> 08:06.546
So, um, is...

08:06.748 --> 08:09.682
Is that the page that August
took out of the storybook?

08:09.718 --> 08:11.584
Did you find anything?

08:11.620 --> 08:13.620
I think this door somehow

08:13.655 --> 08:16.656
Has something to do with the author.

08:16.691 --> 08:19.993
I just have to figure out where it is.

08:20.028 --> 08:21.528
You will.

08:21.563 --> 08:23.029
Here.

08:23.064 --> 08:25.665
[Chuckles]

08:28.703 --> 08:30.203

08:30.238 --> 08:33.206
What are you trying to tell me?

[Tires screech]

08:37.312 --> 08:40.013
[Engine shuts off]

08:40.048 --> 08:42.015
Find anything in there?

08:42.049 --> 08:45.251
Well, a burned table, broken bottles,

08:45.287 --> 08:46.619
Uh, and a very irate granny.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.375
Apparently, Regina and the
witches drank the place dry.

08:48.375 --> 08:49.935
I'd say she won them over.

08:49.935 --> 08:51.514
Unless that's exactly what
they wanted her to think.

08:51.524 --> 08:52.689
Look, I know you're worried,

08:52.689 --> 08:53.853
But we don't even know what happened yet.

08:53.853 --> 08:54.899
That's what's worrying me.

08:54.899 --> 08:56.245
She's not at home.
She's not in her office.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.583
My parents are gonna
check her vault, but...

08:57.583 --> 08:58.735
and you fear the worst.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.066
I can't help but think,

09:00.101 --> 09:01.835
If the undercover thing worked,

09:01.870 --> 09:04.170
If she's got the situation under control,

09:04.206 --> 09:06.272
Then why the hell isn't she back yet?

09:09.644 --> 09:11.044
<i>Maybe this was a bad idea.</i>

09:11.079 --> 09:13.046
If something happened to Regina...

09:13.081 --> 09:15.048
No, like you said, she'll be fine.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.783
She can take care of herself.

That's one of my sheriff's cars.

09:31.132 --> 09:33.132
What the hell happened?

09:33.168 --> 09:36.502
Maleficent happened.

09:36.538 --> 09:38.671
<i>And that is her idea of a good time.</i>

09:38.707 --> 09:39.806
Regina...

09:39.841 --> 09:42.375
Are you okay? What happened last night?

09:42.410 --> 09:44.377
[Sighs] I had to prove myself.

09:44.412 --> 09:46.779
Which meant some drinking, some burning,

09:46.815 --> 09:48.181
And lots of destruction.

09:48.216 --> 09:49.616
Sorry about the car.

09:51.119 --> 09:52.986
And you really shouldn't be here.

09:53.021 --> 09:55.021
Next time, we have to meet covertly.

09:55.056 --> 09:56.155
David: Next time?

09:56.191 --> 09:57.523
You didn't find out
what they're planning?

09:57.559 --> 09:59.058
It was one night.

09:59.094 --> 10:01.227
But I did find out
they're hiding something,

10:01.263 --> 10:03.329
Something incredibly powerful.

10:03.365 --> 10:05.798
Well, what is it?

10:05.834 --> 10:07.200
I don't know.

10:07.235 --> 10:10.203
So, the only thing you accomplished

10:10.238 --> 10:12.572
Was property destruction?

10:12.607 --> 10:14.607
I accomplished trust.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.876
Last time, I had to come to Maleficent.

10:16.912 --> 10:19.979
This time, she'll come to me.

10:23.618 --> 10:26.219
Hello?

10:26.254 --> 10:29.722
Maleficent?

10:29.791 --> 10:32.759
I've...

10:32.794 --> 10:34.427
Been studying magic.

10:37.465 --> 10:40.433
Beginner stuff. [chuckles]

10:40.468 --> 10:43.469
But I thought...

10:43.505 --> 10:45.038
Maybe...

10:47.008 --> 10:49.242
Perhaps you can teach me?

10:49.277 --> 10:51.511
Maleficent: [echoing] why don't
you show me what you've learned

10:51.546 --> 10:52.612
And light that fireplace.

10:56.885 --> 10:57.913
[Sighs]

11:03.725 --> 11:04.924
[Sighs]

11:06.695 --> 11:08.127
Come on.

11:11.399 --> 11:12.799
Come on!

11:14.803 --> 11:16.669
Maleficent: That's pathetic.

11:18.807 --> 11:21.140
But it'll do.

11:24.612 --> 11:25.878
[Sighs]

11:28.383 --> 11:30.850
Ugh, that feels nice.

11:30.885 --> 11:35.521
I haven't had a proper fire in...

11:35.557 --> 11:37.991
Years.

11:39.227 --> 11:42.428
What's that?

11:42.464 --> 11:43.363
[Sighs]

11:46.267 --> 11:50.336
You won't read about
this in any spell book.

11:50.372 --> 11:53.139
A single drop of sleeping curse

11:53.174 --> 11:56.843
Mixed with seawater, toadstool...

11:56.878 --> 11:59.445
Takes the edge off.

11:59.481 --> 12:02.181
[laughs]

12:02.217 --> 12:04.217
What's the matter, dear?

12:04.252 --> 12:06.519
I'm not everything you expected?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.124
What happened to you?

12:11.159 --> 12:13.826
A rose.

12:13.862 --> 12:17.330
<i>A briar rose.</i>

12:17.365 --> 12:20.066

Until king stefan the square jawed

12:23.171 --> 12:26.706
Undid all my work with true love's kiss.

12:26.741 --> 12:29.475
Do you know what?

12:29.511 --> 12:32.345
I don't even care anymore.

12:35.116 --> 12:42.855
The Maleficent I read about,
she would never just give up.

12:42.891 --> 12:45.024
Y-you need to remember
who you really are.

12:46.528 --> 12:48.161
That Maleficent had a foul temper,

12:48.196 --> 12:49.262
And if you insulted her,

12:49.297 --> 12:51.297
She'd turn into a dragon
and eat your flesh.

12:51.332 --> 12:52.865
[Gasps]

12:55.570 --> 12:58.971
It's a good thing for you
I already had breakfast.

13:00.008 --> 13:03.876
Take your dusty book
and get out of my castle.

13:08.783 --> 13:12.418
Well, where the hell
have you been all night?

13:12.454 --> 13:13.786
Don't be nasty.

13:13.855 --> 13:15.321
Regina came to find us.

13:15.356 --> 13:17.223
We had some catching up to do.

13:17.258 --> 13:19.192
Regina?

13:19.227 --> 13:21.294
<i>What was she after?</i>

13:21.329 --> 13:23.830
She was sniffing around for information.

13:23.865 --> 13:26.032
I assume you didn't tell
her I'm what you're hiding.

13:26.067 --> 13:29.535
Oh, we were careful, darling.
She doesn't know a thing.

13:29.571 --> 13:32.071
Very interesting plan,
bringing us all together.

13:32.107 --> 13:33.439
My plan's just beginning.

13:33.475 --> 13:36.242
But Regina does present
an intriguing possibility.

13:36.277 --> 13:37.977
Do you really think she'll help us?

13:38.012 --> 13:40.713
Heartbreak turned her
into a monster once.

13:40.748 --> 13:43.149
And now her heart's been broken anew.

13:43.184 --> 13:47.420
She's lost another love
and is in great pain.

13:47.455 --> 13:50.223
As you and I both know, pain
always makes you stronger.

13:50.258 --> 13:53.059
Indeed it does.

13:53.094 --> 13:55.461
When war hits Storybrooke,

13:55.497 --> 13:58.598
Everyone's gonna have to
pick a side, including Regina.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.833
And what war is that?

14:00.869 --> 14:02.668
Oh, the one we're about to start.

14:02.704 --> 14:05.738
And tonight...

14:05.773 --> 14:08.608
We're gonna throw the first punch.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.962
Driver, stop!

14:23.997 --> 14:26.064
[Horse whinnies]

14:26.100 --> 14:30.435
My dear, what are you doing out
here in the middle of nowhere?

14:30.471 --> 14:33.004
Walking home...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.773
To Leopold's castle.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.374
Oh. That's a long walk.

14:36.410 --> 14:39.678
If you'd like, I can take you
as far as the next kingdom.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.747
I'm headed that way
for the royal wedding.

14:42.783 --> 14:44.349
What wedding?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.585
I assume you've heard of the queen?

14:46.620 --> 14:47.552
Briar Rose?

14:47.588 --> 14:50.322
Her daughter Aurora is to be wed.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.863
Briar Rose's daughter is getting married!

14:57.898 --> 15:00.832
A whole new generation is
getting their happy endings

15:00.868 --> 15:04.002
While you sit up here and rot!

15:04.037 --> 15:07.606
And why in the hell do you care so much?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.608
Because if...

15:11.545 --> 15:15.147
Someone as powerful as you
can't get their revenge...

15:17.417 --> 15:19.117
That means I never will.

15:25.559 --> 15:30.896
So, you've had someone
taken from you, too?

15:30.931 --> 15:31.997
Yes.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.403
And the girl who's
responsible lives and breathes.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.041
And I still don't have my revenge.

15:45.546 --> 15:48.613
Do you want some advice from me?

15:50.717 --> 15:53.818
Give up. Find another hobby.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.327
No.

16:03.830 --> 16:07.566
<i>Isn't this a reason to get up?</i>

16:07.601 --> 16:12.037
To turn back into a dragon? To fight?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.338
I can't.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.908
Doesn't this make your blood boil?

16:16.944 --> 16:19.377
Did you hear me, stupid girl?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.612
I can't!

16:20.647 --> 16:23.548
I can't...

16:23.584 --> 16:26.885
Turn into a dragon anymore.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.889
I lost the fire a long time ago.

16:30.924 --> 16:34.459
Then let's get that fire back.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.701
[Sighs]

16:42.736 --> 16:45.604
Sorry we couldn't stay to clean.

16:45.639 --> 16:48.940
Oh, that's okay.

16:48.976 --> 16:51.309
You need the beauty sleep more than I do.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.682
It's good to see you again, Regina.

16:57.718 --> 17:00.418
Hope you had fun last night.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.354
Last night? Yes.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.723
This morning?

17:04.758 --> 17:05.991
No.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.192
Hmm. Maybe I can help...

17:07.227 --> 17:11.096
With this world's version of magic.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.500
Don't worry. They're not poison.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.968
They're aspirin.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.970
They help with the pain.

17:19.006 --> 17:20.872
I know what they are.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.974
It's just you're not usually nice.

17:24.011 --> 17:27.378
Nice has nothing to do with it.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.914
I need you sharp tonight.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.816
For what?

17:31.852 --> 17:33.618
More games?

17:33.654 --> 17:36.688
No. No more games.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.858
You want to know why we're in this town?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.761
The fact is,

17:42.796 --> 17:45.830
We are after the same
thing as you... the author.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.538
<i>How do you know about the author?</i>

17:53.573 --> 17:55.740
Rumplestiltskin.

17:55.776 --> 17:59.611
He spilled the whole story
to Cruella back in new york.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.579
Well, good luck finding him.

18:01.615 --> 18:03.615
I've been looking for months.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.251
But you've been going about it all wrong.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.853
What you need are some new allies

18:08.889 --> 18:11.289
With new leads on this author.

18:11.325 --> 18:15.627
And these new leads,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.395
Do they have anything to do

18:17.431 --> 18:20.065
With this powerful magic you're hiding?

18:20.100 --> 18:23.001
Before I let you in on that secret,

18:23.036 --> 18:25.603
I've got a little job for you.

18:33.814 --> 18:35.714
Hey, we're here.

18:37.851 --> 18:40.985
I said we needed to meet covertly.

18:41.021 --> 18:43.755
Now I see you brought the
entire Charming softball team

18:43.790 --> 18:45.056
<i>And their pirate mascot?</i>

18:45.092 --> 18:47.459
We were worried about you.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.262
Well, then worry quickly. I
can't be seen with all of you.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.088
Regina, listen to me. This is a bad idea.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.165
This woman, this dragon, she's dangerous,

18:54.201 --> 18:56.101
And you don't know the first
thing about going undercover.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.535
I'm a quick study,

18:57.571 --> 19:01.039
And Maleficent already
told me why they're here.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.807
Apparently, they're
after the author, too.

19:02.843 --> 19:06.444
I simply want him to change my fate.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.946
<i>What do they want?</i>

19:07.981 --> 19:10.148
They want to shift the entire balance

19:10.183 --> 19:12.384
So that villains win and heroes lose.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.420
They feel the only way
to get their happy ending

19:15.455 --> 19:16.755
Is to destroy yours.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.423
Do you think they can find the author?

19:18.458 --> 19:21.393
They have a lead, we don't.

19:21.428 --> 19:26.531
And tonight, they want me
to help them steal it...

19:26.566 --> 19:29.134
Whatever it is.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.770
I'm telling you, these
things never end well.

19:31.805 --> 19:35.774
I understand your concern, but I'm in.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.146
Okay, well, then I'm in too.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.680
What?

19:42.716 --> 19:43.815
I'm gonna stick by you.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.583
I'm gonna get your
back while you do this.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.718
No. It's too dangerous.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.919
I said I was a part
of operation mongoose.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.087
I am a part of it.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.588
You wanted my help...
now you're gonna get it

19:50.624 --> 19:51.923
No matter what it means for both of us.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.326
Whatever she has planned
tonight, I'll be there.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.898
[Wind gusting]

20:09.943 --> 20:12.944
[Engine revs]

20:31.064 --> 20:33.865
Ready to take a drive?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.866
[Exhales sharply]

20:37.237 --> 20:38.503
You want me to get in that?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.171
Cruella enchanted it to drive itself,

20:40.207 --> 20:42.133
Or you could take
the wheel if you prefer.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.949
Yes, I'd very much prefer.

20:46.432 --> 20:47.499
Where are the other two?

20:47.926 --> 20:49.079
Don't worry about them.

20:49.079 --> 20:53.251
It's just you and me
tonight, like old times.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.047
You have to try some of this cake.

21:02.243 --> 21:03.243
It's delicious.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.474
Well, look at which two

21:05.474 --> 21:08.240
Survivors found a dinghy together.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.725
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.728
Uh, Killian, this is...

21:14.763 --> 21:17.531
This is will.

21:17.566 --> 21:19.014
Have the two of you met?

21:19.345 --> 21:20.771
- That we have, yeah.
- Ah.

21:20.977 --> 21:23.278
Now, before you give in
to your pugilistic urges,

21:23.313 --> 21:25.747
Let's take this outside
away from the lady, shall we?

21:25.782 --> 21:28.630
And you clearly don't get along.

21:29.031 --> 21:31.298
As much as I'd enjoy blooding you again,

21:31.333 --> 21:34.334
I'm here for Belle.

21:34.370 --> 21:36.103
We need to talk in private.

21:37.706 --> 21:40.974
And no one knows what these three witches

21:41.010 --> 21:43.577
Want Regina to help them steal?

21:43.612 --> 21:44.842
Not for sure.

21:45.503 --> 21:47.703
But they're powerful
witches seeking more power,

21:47.739 --> 21:49.739
And who's more powerful
than the Dark One?

21:49.774 --> 21:51.807
His dagger... it's still in town, isn't it?

21:51.843 --> 21:54.377
Why do you think they're after it?

21:54.412 --> 21:55.811
What better way to find the author

21:55.847 --> 21:57.680
Than by getting the Dark
One to do it for you?

21:57.715 --> 21:59.315
But how?

21:59.350 --> 22:01.917
Isn't it useless as long as
he's outside of Storybrooke?

22:01.953 --> 22:04.787
Unless they found a way to lure him back.

22:04.822 --> 22:07.289
Any one of them could control him.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.493
Or even worse... use
the dagger to kill him

22:10.528 --> 22:12.161
And become the Dark One herself.

22:12.196 --> 22:13.696
No. We won't let that happen.

22:13.731 --> 22:15.798
I assume you hid the
dagger somewhere safe.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.466
Yeah, of course.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.527
Then let's move it.

22:18.527 --> 22:19.556
What?

22:19.796 --> 22:20.917
They knew him on the outside.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.259
They may have gleaned much about you.

22:22.259 --> 22:23.524
And where you might hide something.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.643
We have to put it somewhere
they would never think to look.

22:27.678 --> 22:28.744
But where?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.780
Don't worry about that.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.449
If you want to bury treasure
where no one could find it,

22:33.484 --> 22:35.484
Leave it to a pirate.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.973
[Brakes squeal]

22:58.009 --> 22:59.675
We're here.

23:04.855 --> 23:08.310
This is Marco's house, the town handyman.

23:08.812 --> 23:12.113
The only magical object
you'll find here is duct tape.

23:12.149 --> 23:14.349
I assure you, there's
something far more valuable.

23:14.384 --> 23:15.984
Actually, someone...

23:16.019 --> 23:19.988
That naughty little piece
of pine he calls a son.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.558
The magical object
you're after is Pinocchio?

23:23.593 --> 23:25.727
He has information about the author,

23:25.762 --> 23:27.796
And we intend to make him tell us.

23:27.831 --> 23:30.765
Which would be a good plan
if I hadn't tried already.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.438
He doesn't remember anything.

23:36.473 --> 23:37.939
Maybe the trouble was

23:37.974 --> 23:41.075
You not asking your
questions more forcefully.

23:41.111 --> 23:43.344
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

23:43.380 --> 23:46.915
I'm beginning to worry
Cruella and ursula were right.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.751
You've spent so much time around heroes,

23:49.786 --> 23:52.320
You've forgotten who you really are.

23:52.355 --> 23:56.724
I'd be careful questioning my commitment.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.395
You want to prove to me you're
the Evil Queen I remember,

24:00.430 --> 24:03.465
Go inside there now and
steal that little boy.

24:07.838 --> 24:11.439
So, there's a tree I
burned that's still on fire.

24:11.475 --> 24:14.976
Who cares? What does it matter?

24:15.011 --> 24:16.644
That's your spark.

24:16.680 --> 24:21.216
That's what's going to
reignite The Dragon inside you.

She's ready, huh?

26:31.481 --> 26:34.349
All that is left is to
see how she gallops.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.619
[Chuckles]

26:37.654 --> 26:39.020
How's that, papa?

26:39.055 --> 26:41.589
She is a steed fit for a prince.

26:41.625 --> 26:44.158
[Knock on door, door opens]

26:44.194 --> 26:48.329
Hello, Marco, Pinocchio.

26:48.365 --> 26:51.032
- May I come in?
- Of course.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.735
Is, uh... is everything all right?

27:11.949 --> 27:12.843
[Door opens]

27:13.295 --> 27:14.025
Regina.

27:14.664 --> 27:15.484
Emma!

27:16.370 --> 27:17.461
What are you doing here?

27:17.461 --> 27:18.490
I've been watching you.

27:18.490 --> 27:19.766
I saw you casting a sleeping spell,

27:19.766 --> 27:20.801
And my gut said something was wrong.

27:20.801 --> 27:22.403
Well, it will be if you
don't get out of here.

27:22.589 --> 27:24.581
Not until you tell me what
Maleficent has you in here doing.

27:24.996 --> 27:26.504
[Sighs] they're after Pinocchio.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.462
I told you these things never end well.

27:28.923 --> 27:30.255
We'll have to do this quickly.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.702
Let's take him out the back
and then find a safe place.

27:31.702 --> 27:33.836
One little snafu and
you're ready to pack up?

27:33.871 --> 27:36.806
What happens when Mal realizes
and lets loose her inner dragon?

27:36.841 --> 27:38.974
This is a child we are
talking about, Regina.

27:39.010 --> 27:39.942
It's too big a risk.

27:39.977 --> 27:41.811
Not if I'm there to keep him safe.

27:41.846 --> 27:42.978
If they try to harm him,

27:43.014 --> 27:44.747
I'll stop them and fight my way out.

27:44.782 --> 27:47.850
Three of them! One of you.

27:47.885 --> 27:50.252
I know you think I'm in
over my head, but I got this.

27:50.288 --> 27:51.787
You don't know them like I do.

27:51.823 --> 27:54.056
Then enlighten me, because
ever since they came to town,

27:54.092 --> 27:55.624
My superpower's been going haywire,

27:55.660 --> 27:57.359
Like everyone, including my own parents,

27:57.395 --> 27:58.661
Is keeping something from me.

27:58.696 --> 28:02.431
Emma, the only ones keeping secrets

28:02.467 --> 28:04.500
Are Maleficent and her friends.

28:04.535 --> 28:07.503
They've taken a page out
of the heroes' playbook.

28:07.538 --> 28:08.971
They're working together,

28:09.006 --> 28:11.707
Which means we have to
take a page out of theirs

28:11.742 --> 28:13.642
And break some rules.

28:18.182 --> 28:19.582
I'll be right on your tail.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.617
I see anything I don't like,
and I will come in blazing.

28:38.569 --> 28:40.736
It's good to have you back.

[Horse neighs]

29:05.196 --> 29:07.029
What are you doing?

29:07.064 --> 29:09.565
I'm not going out like this.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.534
You're gonna fight?

29:11.569 --> 29:14.170
There's too many of them.

29:14.205 --> 29:16.205
Guess we'll have to hope
my fireballs have improved.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.339
<i>You can't defeat them.</i>

29:17.375 --> 29:21.610
You're right. Not without a dragon's help.

[Horses whinnying]

29:31.522 --> 29:33.255

29:50.741 --> 29:53.742
[Roars]

29:53.778 --> 29:55.978
Retreat!

29:57.181 --> 29:59.248
Look who's back.

30:02.587 --> 30:04.353
Aah!

30:11.395 --> 30:13.095
Come on. What's the hold up?

30:13.130 --> 30:13.829
Why aren't you...

30:17.902 --> 30:18.934
No!

30:27.311 --> 30:28.677
No.

30:30.915 --> 30:34.250
Regina, what are you doing?

30:39.690 --> 30:42.725
[Aurora humming]

30:55.072 --> 30:58.007
You must be aurora...

30:59.343 --> 31:03.178
Briar rose's sweet-smelling
bud of a daughter.

31:05.583 --> 31:08.183
Maleficent.

31:08.219 --> 31:09.985
But my father...

31:10.021 --> 31:11.820
Said he was going to protect you.

31:11.856 --> 31:14.390
He failed.

31:14.425 --> 31:16.992
I was going to kill him, you know.

31:17.028 --> 31:19.828
I was going to kill your mother, too,

31:19.864 --> 31:21.297
Until I realized...

31:21.332 --> 31:22.931
They would suffer far worse

31:22.967 --> 31:26.135
If they were alive to see
what I'm going to do to you.

31:31.075 --> 31:34.677
My mother defeated you, as shall I.

31:34.712 --> 31:38.113
<i>All it will take is what
I have and you never will.</i>

31:38.149 --> 31:40.349
True love?

31:40.384 --> 31:41.884
Don't count on it.

31:41.919 --> 31:45.154
I have my own quite special curse in mind

31:45.189 --> 31:47.056
For your prince phillip.

31:47.091 --> 31:48.324
No!

32:01.238 --> 32:04.406
<i>That was inspired.</i>

32:04.442 --> 32:06.909
Well, it never would've
happened if it wasn't for you.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.181
You reminded me of who I am.

32:12.216 --> 32:14.750
Thank you.

32:25.596 --> 32:28.664
Thank goodness it's safe. [sniffles]

32:28.699 --> 32:30.699
Do, uh... do you know where
you're going to hide it?

32:30.735 --> 32:32.835
The less you know about it, the better.

32:32.870 --> 32:34.036
Take Gold's car.

32:34.071 --> 32:37.106
You won't seem me again
until it's in a place

32:37.141 --> 32:39.908
Where no one will ever find it.

32:39.944 --> 32:42.111
Thank you, Killian.

32:42.146 --> 32:44.747
The idea of Rumple returning after...

32:44.782 --> 32:47.049
After everything that happened,

32:47.084 --> 32:49.251
I...I don't know what I'd do.

32:49.286 --> 32:51.587
At least you don't have
to worry about that now.

32:56.093 --> 32:58.127
What is it, love? Is something wrong?

32:59.563 --> 33:02.931
Yeah, I just had the most awful thought.

33:02.967 --> 33:06.435
What if... what if Rumple's already here?

33:06.470 --> 33:09.371
You mean inside the
town lines? Isn't that...

33:09.407 --> 33:13.041
Impossible, yes, but... I don't know.

33:13.077 --> 33:16.145
I just have this... this terrible feeling.

33:16.180 --> 33:19.648
This is my only protection.

33:20.785 --> 33:22.751
Well, if you're concerned he's here,

33:22.787 --> 33:24.586
There's one way to know for sure.

33:24.622 --> 33:27.723
Use the dagger. Command
him to come face you.

33:27.758 --> 33:30.058
If he's here, he has no choice.

33:36.834 --> 33:40.269
Dark One, if you're here,

33:40.304 --> 33:43.906
Come and face me... now.

[Thunder crashes in distance]

Here.

[Bell jingles]

34:50.161 --> 34:54.565
Ah, Killian. So, is the dagger safe?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.033
Yes.

34:56.068 --> 34:57.835
And now that it's hidden,

34:57.870 --> 35:00.437
We have one last piece of business.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.740
We must swear a pirate's oath.

35:02.775 --> 35:04.875
We must promise to never talk

35:04.910 --> 35:07.378
About what happened today again...

35:07.413 --> 35:09.613
To one another or anyone else.

35:09.648 --> 35:12.116
It's the only way to assure
the dagger stays safe.

35:22.862 --> 35:24.928
You have my word.

35:24.964 --> 35:28.732
And you have mine.

35:30.069 --> 35:31.435
[Chuckles]

35:31.470 --> 35:33.337
I'm guessing that's a gift
from your admirer, Will.

35:33.372 --> 35:35.139
[Chuckles] yeah.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.342
It was outside when I got here.

35:38.377 --> 35:41.879
If you don't mind, are...

35:41.914 --> 35:43.580
Things serious?

35:43.616 --> 35:44.548
[Chuckles]

35:44.583 --> 35:47.985
What it is, is... It's new.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.955
And beyond that, I-i don't know.

35:51.991 --> 35:54.324
You're so... Different.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.926
I know, and,

35:55.961 --> 35:58.228
After Rumple, it's so nice to...

35:58.264 --> 36:00.397
Spend time with someone

36:00.433 --> 36:03.567
Who's nothing more
than who he says he is.

36:03.602 --> 36:07.704
So you're over him, then, Rumplestiltskin?

36:07.740 --> 36:12.109
I don't know if I can ever be over him.

36:12.144 --> 36:15.179
But for now, will makes me smile.

36:15.214 --> 36:19.283
I'm glad to hear that.

36:19.318 --> 36:21.752
Goodnight, then.

36:21.787 --> 36:24.421
Oh, Killian, uh...

36:24.457 --> 36:25.589
About Will.

36:25.624 --> 36:27.157
I was wondering,

36:27.193 --> 36:30.427
What h... what happened
between you two?

36:32.064 --> 36:35.766
Let's just say he took
something I care for.

36:47.213 --> 36:48.912
[Giggles]

37:04.663 --> 37:08.132
How did you get here so soon?

37:08.167 --> 37:10.667
On the back of a dragon. How else?

37:10.703 --> 37:12.136
You mean Maleficent?

37:12.171 --> 37:14.805
I was certain she'd lost that power.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.075
Well, it's more like forgotten...

37:18.110 --> 37:21.745
Until I helped her remember who she was.

37:21.780 --> 37:25.482
<i>I thought it was you that
was seeking a teacher,</i>

37:25.518 --> 37:28.018
Not the other way around.

37:28.053 --> 37:30.487
I was.

37:30.523 --> 37:33.590
But then I realized...

37:35.728 --> 37:37.594
I already had a teacher,

37:37.630 --> 37:40.531
One who was doing quite well with me.

37:40.566 --> 37:41.865
Glad to hear it.

37:41.901 --> 37:44.935
I can see you're doing quite well, too.

37:44.970 --> 37:47.371
And why do I get the feeling

37:47.406 --> 37:50.474
That that pony's not just taking a nap?

37:50.509 --> 37:53.443
Well, of course he is...

37:53.479 --> 37:56.980
For another 100 years or so.

37:57.016 --> 37:58.582
[Giggles]

38:01.453 --> 38:04.521
Maleficent helped me see

38:04.557 --> 38:07.858
Death is too good for Snow White.

38:07.893 --> 38:11.328
I need to take away what she loves.

38:12.565 --> 38:15.132
A lesson I've been trying to teach.

38:17.369 --> 38:18.869
Well...

38:18.904 --> 38:22.539
I'm finally ready to learn.

38:22.575 --> 38:26.476
No matter how long it takes, I can do it.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.512
<i>I can get my revenge.</i>

38:38.691 --> 38:41.158
Gold's cabin?

38:41.193 --> 38:43.961
What are we doing here?

38:43.996 --> 38:46.029
We needed someplace out of the way

38:46.065 --> 38:49.032
To hang our headdresses and
hide our kidnapped puppets,

38:49.068 --> 38:51.568
And this little hovel
became available to us.

38:51.604 --> 38:55.305
No.

38:55.341 --> 38:58.408
Your dark magic...

38:58.444 --> 39:02.145
It's not a spell or an object.

39:02.181 --> 39:03.614
It's...

39:03.649 --> 39:06.950
Mr. Gold: That's right, deary.

39:06.986 --> 39:08.785
It's me.

39:15.427 --> 39:18.795
You didn't really think I'd stay
banished for long, now, did you?

39:20.499 --> 39:22.165
No.

39:22.201 --> 39:24.835
I didn't.

39:24.870 --> 39:26.169
I learned quite a bit about myself

39:26.205 --> 39:27.738
On my little journey outside Storybrooke.

39:27.773 --> 39:30.274
- [Chuckles lightly]
- You were right, Regina.

39:30.309 --> 39:33.610
Sometimes the teacher needs
to learn from the student.

39:33.646 --> 39:36.880
And sometimes...

39:36.915 --> 39:39.883
You need to fall very far...

39:39.918 --> 39:42.352
To finally see the light.

39:42.388 --> 39:45.155
Well, then you've finally
accepted the same truth I have.

39:45.190 --> 39:49.760
You can't get your happy ending
without finding the author.

39:49.795 --> 39:52.229
I suppose that puts us on the same side.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.830
I suppose it does.

39:58.837 --> 40:04.541
And now, with the help of
the real boy you've acquired,

40:04.576 --> 40:06.576
We can take our first steps.

40:06.612 --> 40:08.378
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

40:08.414 --> 40:10.681
Step aside, and I'll show you.

40:10.716 --> 40:13.950
Or have you gone soft?

40:16.188 --> 40:19.923
[Chuckles] never.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.197
What a relief.

40:30.869 --> 40:34.504
You see, we're not gonna
ask young Pinocchio here

40:34.540 --> 40:36.273
To remember anything...

40:36.308 --> 40:37.674
Because he can't.

40:37.710 --> 40:42.646
No amount of torture will work on him.

40:42.681 --> 40:46.316
But it will succeed on
the man he used to be.

40:55.694 --> 41:00.030
Welcome back, August.

41:00.065 --> 41:02.866
Now...

41:02.901 --> 41:04.369

you were still playing with puppies.

<i>To re-write the storybook, the
queen of darkness needs answers.</i>

41:23.250 --> 41:25.204

41:29.775 --> 41:30.796
I'll offer you a deal.

I don't think so.
