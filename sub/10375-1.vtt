Exploring the Antarctic is almost

52:37.807 --> 52:39.320
like exploring space.

52:40.007 --> 52:41.360

no animals...

52:44.727 --> 52:45.921
...no plants...

54:10.167 --> 54:12.203
The Ice is everywhere and everything

54:13.007 --> 54:15.805
It spreads to all sides, an unbounded void of

alien whiteness in geometric rigor.

54:18.927 --> 54:22.237
Antarctic is the highest,
windiest, driest continent.

54:23.007 --> 54:25.237
Its topography and dynamics
is simpliest on earth

54:25.407 --> 54:27.363
An exercise of reductionism

54:32.447 --> 54:35.007
The iceberg is the microcosm
of Antarctica

54:35.367 --> 54:39.406
It's a fragment torn loose from the
continent, both substance and symbol

54:39.767 --> 54:43.396
within its ice the burg contains
record of all ice terrains

54:43.927 --> 54:47.044
As it moves away from the massive ice
it gradually disintegrates

54:48.127 --> 54:50.561

two month in an open sea.

She didn't want me to come to the airport or
to the station with her

01:00:40.047 --> 01:00:41.685
She didn't want any long goodbyes

01:01:12.287 --> 01:01:15.996
When you fly over the continent
you see the journey of the ice in reverse

01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.602
The sea, the Iceberg, the sea ice,

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:21.201
the ice shelf and the ice sheet.

01:01:22.367 --> 01:01:24.961
Each year the Ice inches its way
from the heart of the continent

01:01:25.127 --> 01:01:27.595
to the sea into which, it finally melts.

01:01:34.127 --> 01:01:35.355
It's beautiful!

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.165
[ Black Rebel Motorcycles Club - Love Burns ]
You might know this one.

01:02:18.487 --> 01:02:22.196
Never thought I'd
see her go away

01:02:22.367 --> 01:02:24.642
She learned I loved her today

01:02:25.647 --> 01:02:29.481
Never thought I'd
see her cry

01:02:29.647 --> 01:02:31.877
And I learned how to
love her today

01:02:33.407 --> 01:02:36.080
Never thought
I'd rather die

01:02:36.247 --> 01:02:37.805
Then try to keep her

01:02:37.967 --> 01:02:40.276
by my side.

01:02:40.727 --> 01:02:44.197
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:02:44.607 --> 01:02:46.165
Now she's gone love

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:48.318
burns inside me

01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:51.719
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:03.077
Nothing else can
hurt us now

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:07.121
No loss, our love's been
hung on a cross

01:03:07.447 --> 01:03:10.086
Nothing seems to
make a sound

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.196
And now it's all
so clear somehow

01:03:15.087 --> 01:03:16.679
Nothing really

01:03:16.847 --> 01:03:18.439
matters now

01:03:18.607 --> 01:03:22.282
Now we're gone and on our way

01:03:22.727 --> 01:03:26.402
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:30.122
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:33.604
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:37.564
She cuts my skin and
bruise my lips

01:03:37.727 --> 01:03:40.446
She's everything to me

01:03:41.447 --> 01:03:43.358
She tears my clothes

01:03:43.527 --> 01:03:45.040
and burns my eyes.

01:03:45.207 --> 01:03:47.562
She's all
I want to see

01:03:49.047 --> 01:03:52.562
She brings the cold
and scars my soul

01:03:53.327 --> 01:03:55.636
She's heaven sent to me

01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:00.484
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:04:00.647 --> 01:04:03.719
Now she's gone love burns

01:04:03.887 --> 01:04:06.640
inside me.
Now she's gone love

01:04:06.807 --> 01:04:08.001
burns inside me.

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:10.681
I never will believe that I left
you that way I did.

01:04:12.087 --> 01:04:14.442
Kiss my love and wish
you

01:04:14.607 --> 01:04:15.676
go.

01:04:15.847 --> 01:04:18.725
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:22.559
I never will believe that I left
you that way I did.

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:27.003
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:30.955
Can kiss my love and
wish you go.

01:04:31.727 --> 01:04:34.958
Now she's gone love
burns inside me

01:04:35.207 --> 01:04:38.722
Now she's gone love
