Benson. Special Victims Unit. Jumper?

Jumpers open the windows first.

00:52.417 --> 00:55.454
Cleared the sidewalk, nailed the car.

00:56.497 --> 00:58.249
All right.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.612
Anybody notify SVU?

01:11.657 --> 01:14.410
Because she's not wearing panties?

01:14.457 --> 01:16.846
Just cover her up.

01:19.057 --> 01:22.732
- Check that out.
- Hey. What are we looking at?

01:22.777 --> 01:28.090
No forced entry. Two glasses of
half-drunk wine. Two sets of prints.

01:28.137 --> 01:29.729
Lovers' quarrel.

01:29.777 --> 01:32.655
Lovers' quarrel?
They usually kiss and make up.

01:32.697 --> 01:35.450
Detective. Pack of ultra-ribs.

01:35.497 --> 01:37.488
Looks like they did more than kiss.

01:37.537 --> 01:43.089
Yeah. They made passionate love
and before he rolled over to sleep,

01:43.137 --> 01:46.573
he heaved her out the window.
Through the window.

01:46.617 --> 01:49.575
What's this outburst leading up to?

01:50.457 --> 01:52.413
Rape.

01:52.457 --> 01:54.607
Like I said, no forced entry.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.330
I didn't say it was a stranger.

01:57.377 --> 02:00.574
She wasn't exactly dressed
in her refusal outfit.

02:00.617 --> 02:02.573
I didn't hear you say that.

02:02.617 --> 02:05.893

My partner and I

02:09.937 --> 02:13.850
were called in on apparent homicide

02:13.897 --> 02:18.095
Oh, right. You want it? Fine. You take it.

02:18.137 --> 02:21.129
Scooch. Let's move it.

02:21.177 --> 02:23.645
OK, guys. Wrap it up.

03:26.497 --> 03:30.251
- Eight storeys up, eight down.
- Like she was shot out of a cannon.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.286
Guy on steroids?

03:31.337 --> 03:34.807
No. The Yankees are in Baltimore
kicking ass.

03:34.857 --> 03:37.849
- How about testosterone-driven rage?
- Boyfriend?

03:37.897 --> 03:40.457
Or girl. You could toss 100lb.

03:40.497 --> 03:43.648
- Toss you, you skinny-ass geek.
- See? The rage.

03:43.697 --> 03:47.053
- The neighbours?
- Nobody knew her beyond a wave.

03:47.097 --> 03:50.214
She worked at home. She carried a laptop.

03:50.257 --> 03:52.817
- Whole thing's a pyramid scheme.
- What?

03:52.857 --> 03:58.090
Laptops. We've become a nation of
laptoppers. What happened to pens?

03:58.137 --> 04:01.732
She went to a Dr Daniels
every Tuesday and Thursday.

04:01.777 --> 04:03.927
Address book. What did she do?

04:03.977 --> 04:07.447

- Yes, sir.
- You get hung up, call me.

04:35.377 --> 04:39.290
'This is Gretchen. Leave a message. Bye.'

04:39.337 --> 04:41.931
'You have no messages.'

04:46.577 --> 04:49.967
'This is Gretchen. Leave a message. Bye.'

04:50.017 --> 04:52.770
'You have no messages.'

04:52.817 --> 04:55.809
It was like someone was
throwing something.

04:55.857 --> 04:56.846
And then what?

04:56.897 --> 05:00.526
Scream, crunch
and the car alarm going off.

05:00.577 --> 05:02.010
Did you see anybody leave?

05:02.057 --> 05:06.812
Stick my head out and look?
Right. So he could see my face.

05:06.857 --> 05:10.372
How long does that apartment
stay a crime scene?

05:10.417 --> 05:13.807
- Why?
- We're on the list for one-bedrooms.

05:13.857 --> 05:16.166
- What's your name?
- Jason Cargill.

05:16.217 --> 05:20.210
I'm with the real-estate board.
You're off the list.

05:22.777 --> 05:26.565
Half of them admitted they couldn't
tell their neighbours from the perp.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.414
- Could you?
- What?

05:28.457 --> 05:31.449
- Tell your neighbours apart?
- Why? Cos I live here?

05:31.497 --> 05:34.057
I'm never home. I'm always with you.

05:34.097 --> 05:37.885
- And they call suburbs anonymous.
- Queens is a suburb? Since when?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.213
Since we got space, trees, grass to mow.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.646
I got an eight by ten and you're mowing?

05:43.697 --> 05:46.006
I do. Sometimes.

05:46.057 --> 05:49.367
Kathy does all the housework.
You're never there.

05:49.417 --> 05:53.376
OK. Kathy's the man of the house
till Dickie's old enough.

05:53.417 --> 05:58.093
You've got nothing to worry about.
Definitely got no lawn to mow.

05:58.137 --> 06:01.732
- Yeah. I'm a regular monk.
- Monkette.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.888
What?

06:07.537 --> 06:09.528
Nothing.

06:17.817 --> 06:20.012
- Did you give Sears a call?
- Yes.

06:20.057 --> 06:23.447
- And?
- And the limited warranty expired.

06:23.497 --> 06:25.647
How the hell did that happen?

06:25.697 --> 06:29.087
You wanted to buy the garbage disposal
and install it yourself.

06:29.137 --> 06:31.446
I installed this properly.

06:31.497 --> 06:35.092
If you guys would stop throwing
so much crap down it...

06:35.137 --> 06:37.731
- Get off the phone, please.
- I gotta go.

06:40.497 --> 06:44.126
Have you seen the turtle?
I left him in the sink.

06:48.177 --> 06:50.611
When you asked the defendant

06:50.657 --> 06:55.094
what was he thinking at the time
of the assault, what did he say?

06:55.137 --> 07:00.211
He said he thought she was smiling
at him so he sat next to her.

07:00.257 --> 07:03.488
The number three train at...
What stop was it?

07:03.537 --> 07:08.452
96th Street. I think the defendant's
a professor at Manhattan University.

07:08.497 --> 07:11.455
He took a seat and then what happened?

07:11.497 --> 07:16.287
He struck up a conversation with her,
but on receiving no response,

07:16.337 --> 07:20.376
- he surmised she was asleep.
- And then what did he do?

07:20.417 --> 07:22.772
Hearsay, Your Honour.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.969
Then what did Professor Ormond
tell you he did next?

07:27.017 --> 07:32.296
He put his hand inside her blouse
and placed her hand on his b...

07:32.337 --> 07:34.897
On his, erm...

07:34.937 --> 07:37.053
genital region.

07:37.097 --> 07:41.409
And then he made her rub him until he c...

07:42.337 --> 07:45.056
Until he reached his intended goal.

07:45.097 --> 07:47.452
No further questions.

07:47.497 --> 07:52.617
How did this become your case?
Were you on duty in the subway?

07:52.657 --> 07:56.047
No. A passenger alerted the transit police.

07:56.097 --> 07:59.373
The case was referred
to the Special Victims Unit.

07:59.417 --> 08:02.727
Of which you're a member?
For how long?

08:02.777 --> 08:06.167
- Eight months.
- You're an expert on sex crimes?

08:06.217 --> 08:09.846
- We all have something to learn.
- I'm sure.

08:09.897 --> 08:15.176
Can you tell us the technical term
for fondling a stranger?

08:16.297 --> 08:18.049
Fromage.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.726
I believe it's frottage.

08:22.777 --> 08:24.529
Frottage.

08:24.577 --> 08:28.172
Since the passenger
turned out not to be sleeping

08:28.217 --> 08:31.607
but was deceased,
what would you call that?

08:31.657 --> 08:35.616
I don't know what it's called
but I call it disgusting!

08:35.657 --> 08:40.287
You disapprove on moral grounds.
But since the victim, being dead,

08:40.337 --> 08:44.967
couldn't have known she was being
'fromaged', where's the assault?

08:51.057 --> 08:54.174
You look as happy as a postal worker
at Christmas.

08:54.217 --> 08:58.608
- Make me feel better.
- We got papers from her apartment.

08:58.657 --> 09:01.774
No threatening letters
or phone messages.

09:01.817 --> 09:04.172
She makes JD Salinger look like a Shriner.

09:04.217 --> 09:09.007
Tell me about it. Not one person
in her life knows she's dead yet.

09:09.057 --> 09:11.810
Struck out with the next of kin?

09:11.857 --> 09:16.806
On her lease application she left
'Notify in case of emergency' blank.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.850
If he'd killed her inside,
she'd have been there for months.

09:20.897 --> 09:23.650
Could you imagine living like that?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.255
What?

09:25.297 --> 09:28.289
Still a lot of Jane Does
on the books years later.

09:28.337 --> 09:31.454
Not on ours. Somebody knows her story.

09:31.497 --> 09:34.091
- Her shrink.
- OK. Her shrink.

09:38.817 --> 09:43.447
Hello. Listen,
I don't accept walk-ins or couples.

09:43.497 --> 09:47.046
- In fact, I'm expecting a patient.
- We're not a couple.

09:47.097 --> 09:49.930
Your patient won't be coming in.

09:49.977 --> 09:52.935
- What do you mean?
- She's dead.

09:55.017 --> 09:58.896
We've been unable to locate
next of kin, a boyfriend...

09:58.937 --> 10:02.168
- We're hoping you could help.
- I can't do that.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.777
Doctor-patient, blah, blah, blah.

10:04.817 --> 10:09.811
We could get a court order to help
you out of your ethical quagmire.

10:12.937 --> 10:17.533
Gretchen's parents are dead.
She has a sister named Ellen Travis.

10:17.577 --> 10:19.295
Fiancé? Boyfriend?

10:19.337 --> 10:24.013
Not that she mentioned.
She was a very private person.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.491
Except with you.

10:26.537 --> 10:29.210
Well, that's what I get paid for.

10:30.017 --> 10:32.611
The shrink didn't even ask how she died.

10:32.657 --> 10:37.173
He was trying not to answer
our questions so didn't ask any either.

10:37.217 --> 10:40.653
Lacerations from the glass.
Broken neck, ribs, lumbar.

10:40.697 --> 10:43.416
- Before or from the fall?
- From.

10:43.457 --> 10:46.017
Any sign of a struggle?

10:46.057 --> 10:49.493
The neighbour heard a lot
of commotion before the fall.

10:49.537 --> 10:53.689
Must have been consensual commotion.
No internal abrasions.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.888
A gun to the head
wouldn't leave an abrasion.

10:56.937 --> 10:59.531
I'm on your side, Detective.

11:02.097 --> 11:07.046
I left messages for everyone
the shrink gave up, including the sister.

11:07.097 --> 11:11.454
Voicemail, voicemail, voicemail.
Doesn't anybody pick up the phone?

11:11.497 --> 11:15.172
- She was hiding from somebody.
- A violent ex?

11:15.217 --> 11:18.527
- The shrink said no boyfriend.
- He seemed uncertain.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.646
Uncooperative.

11:19.697 --> 11:23.849
Get a court order and compel him
to stop his pussyfooting.

11:23.897 --> 11:26.730
Jackson.

11:26.777 --> 11:28.768
Elliot.

11:31.177 --> 11:33.372
Stabler. Yeah.

11:34.297 --> 11:37.050
Good. Get out of here.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.692
Any priors? Thanks a lot. I love computers.

11:40.737 --> 11:44.173
- The print on the wine glass?
- Matched one they got in Albany.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.536
State prison?

11:45.577 --> 11:49.286
State Department of Psychiatry.
Dr Mark Daniels.

11:49.337 --> 11:51.134
Her own shrink?

11:51.177 --> 11:54.169
I guess the pussyfooting's over.

11:57.297 --> 12:01.813
My brother wants to be helpful
but legally his hands are tied.

12:01.857 --> 12:07.011
His hands were in her apartment.
We lifted your prints from a glass.

12:07.057 --> 12:11.255
Can you explain when and why
you were visiting your patient?

12:11.297 --> 12:16.246
He was in Miss Quinn's apartment
briefly at lunchtime at her request

12:16.297 --> 12:18.413
to attend to a crisis.

12:18.457 --> 12:21.017
- Or an erection?
- That's insulting.

12:21.057 --> 12:25.016
- The absence of one's insulting.
- What's your point?

12:25.057 --> 12:28.606
What was your brother doing
in her apartment?

12:28.657 --> 12:31.410
A brief professional consultation.

12:31.457 --> 12:36.167
He returned to the office at 2:30
for the rest of the day.

12:36.217 --> 12:39.573
Where were you that evening
at eight o'clock?

12:39.617 --> 12:42.973
- I don't think...
- I was at a fellow therapist's,

12:43.017 --> 12:46.168
a lady fellow therapist's, having dinner.

12:46.217 --> 12:48.731
I left there around 9:00.

12:48.777 --> 12:53.567
Have you got a name and number
on your lady fellow-therapist friend?

12:53.617 --> 12:58.327
Dr Daniels was at my apartment
from 6:30 till 9:00.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.811
Was anyone else home?

13:00.857 --> 13:04.896
- No. What's this about?
- Maybe you should ask the doctor.

13:04.937 --> 13:06.416
He is extremely busy.

13:06.457 --> 13:10.450
Do you know any other women
he's getting busy with?

13:10.497 --> 13:13.250
We have a professional relationship.

13:13.297 --> 13:17.495
I have absolutely no interest
in his personal life. Excuse me.

13:17.537 --> 13:20.574
- Do you think she's lying?
- Who can tell?

13:20.617 --> 13:22.972
It's me.

13:23.017 --> 13:24.575
Stabler.

13:24.617 --> 13:28.292
Hey, buddy. Thanks for getting
back to me so quickly.

13:28.337 --> 13:32.171
No. This is about a woman.
She wrote for you.

13:34.497 --> 13:37.011
Perfect. See you then.

13:39.137 --> 13:42.607
- How you been?
- Good. This is my partner, Olivia.

13:42.657 --> 13:45.649
- How are you?
- Better looking than Alfonse.

13:45.697 --> 13:49.849
- What happened to Fatso? Coronary?
- Retired and moved to Florida.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.331
You know this woman?

13:52.377 --> 13:55.926
- I don't think so.
- How about her?

13:55.977 --> 14:00.607
Yeah. That girl on 82nd Street.
I saw the photo on the competition.

14:00.657 --> 14:03.217
We don't go for death scenes.

14:03.257 --> 14:07.455
- Her name was Gretchen Quinn.
- No. You sure?

14:07.497 --> 14:10.216
Found your name in her Rolodex.

14:10.257 --> 14:15.251
I talked to her on the phone.
She'd call to say she liked a column.

14:15.297 --> 14:17.447
I never met her.

14:17.497 --> 14:21.536
- You ran some of her articles.
- I'm a columnist, not an editor.

14:21.577 --> 14:24.330
She was just another by-line to me.

14:24.377 --> 14:29.212
- Wow. She was a...
- A what? Stone-cold fox? A babe?

14:29.257 --> 14:32.329
No. You're a babe. And a stone-cold fox.

14:32.377 --> 14:37.087
This girl...
This is some deep, deep well you'd fall into.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.332
What a waste.

14:39.977 --> 14:43.492
Maybe Munch is right.
We should get off computers.

14:43.537 --> 14:45.846
- Relish.
- Relish.

14:45.897 --> 14:48.855
Get out, rub elbows more.
What do you think?

14:48.897 --> 14:51.650
- A little more relish.
- Thank you.

14:51.697 --> 14:55.895
Her credit card shows a series
of expensive dinners,

14:55.937 --> 14:59.691
the last one at Il Posto Vecchio for $372.

14:59.737 --> 15:02.854
- Not cheap.
- Nope. Ah! Grazie.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.375
So many beautiful faces to remember.

15:08.417 --> 15:12.251
Oh, dumb me.
Will this help jog your memory?

15:12.297 --> 15:17.166
She was with one of the anchors.
Not local. But they all look the same.

15:17.217 --> 15:21.654
I remember her. She was with
Dallas Warner. Got a serious tip.

15:21.697 --> 15:24.257
Those anchors make a lot of money.

15:24.297 --> 15:28.688
Not from him, from her.
I guess she was his boss. I love that.

15:31.297 --> 15:36.132
We're gonna lead with the Senate rep.
She was a riveting interview.

15:36.177 --> 15:38.850
We're here about Gretchen Quinn.

15:38.897 --> 15:43.334
Related to Sally?
My wife and I are having dinner with her.

15:43.377 --> 15:47.655
Not Sally, Gretchen.
She was also a writer. You knew her.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.973
Is there anylhing you can do with this?

15:51.017 --> 15:53.975
- Mr Warner.
- Excuse us.

15:54.017 --> 15:56.372
Yes or no?

15:56.417 --> 15:58.772
Knew her?

15:58.817 --> 16:02.446
Does anybody ever really know anybody?

16:02.497 --> 16:07.571
Don't get philosophical. You're
a teleprompter jockey. We're just cops.

16:07.617 --> 16:11.405
- I haven't seen her for a month.
- Were you on the air last night?

16:11.457 --> 16:15.530
I'm off Saturday through Monday.
I was having dinner with my wife.

16:15.577 --> 16:19.126
There's a roomful of waiters
who know I was there.

16:19.177 --> 16:22.533
I assume you can confirm this
without contacting her.

16:23.257 --> 16:27.216
If you'd like a picture of her,
I'll provide one for you.

16:27.257 --> 16:29.248
On in five.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.010
'Good evening. I'm Dallas Warner.'

16:33.057 --> 16:37.016
He's either a sociopath
or really believes his line of BS.

16:37.057 --> 16:38.615
Sociopath.

16:38.657 --> 16:41.694
Does he think he's the second coming
of Walter Cronkite?

16:41.737 --> 16:44.331
He granted us an interview.

16:44.377 --> 16:47.653
Like he was doing Gretchen a favour
having her on the side.

16:47.697 --> 16:50.257
- Hubris.
- Tell me about it.

16:50.297 --> 16:56.406
He's already figured that her death
is less important than his life, his career.

16:56.457 --> 16:58.925
- Oh, man.
- What?

16:58.977 --> 17:02.652
You just know, a guy like that,
his alibi's gonna check.

17:03.697 --> 17:05.688
Bastard.

17:07.457 --> 17:10.529
Couple of days ago. How could I forget?

17:10.577 --> 17:14.126
She was having drinks
with that gorgeous anchorman.

17:14.176 --> 17:16.133
Dallas Warner.

17:16.176 --> 17:18.611
- She didn't look happy, though.
- Why's that?

17:18.656 --> 17:21.808
Women? Who knows?
I should have such problems.

17:21.857 --> 17:23.688
Professional or personal?

17:23.737 --> 17:28.015
She was stroking his arm, crying.
He was sitting up straight.

17:28.057 --> 17:33.336
I've seen this a hundred times.
The body language, it was personal.

17:33.377 --> 17:36.813
The man was already gone. Is that all?

17:39.257 --> 17:41.248
Please.

17:43.857 --> 17:49.056
I was with her Monday night.
When I heard she was dead, I was shocked.

17:49.097 --> 17:53.613
Funny. You didn't look shocked.
You seemed rather cool, in fact.

17:53.657 --> 17:56.251
I was being discreet, Detective.

17:56.297 --> 18:00.051
Being discreet and lying
to the police are two different animals.

18:00.097 --> 18:03.646
Before me she'd been
with a bunch of lying psychos.

18:03.697 --> 18:06.928
- Do you know the other liars' names?
- No.

18:06.977 --> 18:11.209
I was safe. I called her often
and returned her calls promptly.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.135
What happened the last time you saw her?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.327
She called me up, crying.

18:16.377 --> 18:20.006
I asked her to meet for a drink.
I had time before dinner.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.572
She told me she'd been
sleeping with her psychiatrist

18:23.617 --> 18:25.733
for a couple of weeks.

18:25.777 --> 18:29.452
- Why would she confide in you?
- Because I'm a good listener.

18:29.497 --> 18:31.010
To get into somebody's pants.

18:31.057 --> 18:35.209
If you wanna get snotty, Detective,
I'll call my lawyer right now.

18:35.257 --> 18:38.215
And I'll ask him if you killed Gretchen.

18:38.257 --> 18:42.011
- Why would I do that?
- To stop her blabbing to your wife.

18:42.057 --> 18:44.617
- That's enough.
- Excuse us one second.

18:44.657 --> 18:48.536
Detective Benson,
why don't you talk to Carmichael

18:48.577 --> 18:51.774
and see if we can get that OBB started?

18:55.457 --> 18:59.291
Do you want me to bust him in the grill?
We're not getting anywhere.

18:59.337 --> 19:02.170
- It's not we, it's me.
- What's that mean?

19:02.217 --> 19:05.846
That pompous jerk
won't deal with a woman. You go in.

19:05.897 --> 19:08.457
- Are we good?
- We're good.

19:08.497 --> 19:11.216
Everything all right, Detective?

19:11.257 --> 19:13.213
Oh, yeah.

19:13.257 --> 19:15.407
She's... You know.

19:15.457 --> 19:19.609
Up here, you get a whole
different perspective on people.

19:19.657 --> 19:21.807
Like ants.

19:21.857 --> 19:24.007
Yeah. A bit.

19:24.057 --> 19:27.015
So, we were with Gretchen's shrink.

19:27.057 --> 19:30.652
She said that at first it had been exhilarating,

19:30.697 --> 19:35.452
him knowing all of her darkest shadows
and falling for her anyway.

19:35.497 --> 19:39.376
- I said she should sue him.
- Little late for that.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.773
If you repeat what you've told me
for a grand jury...

19:42.817 --> 19:45.377
This was off the record.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.932
It's not a 60 Minutes interview.
It's a homicide investigation.

19:48.977 --> 19:53.129
It's your word against mine
and mine is trusted around the world.

19:55.137 --> 19:56.126
Oh.

19:56.937 --> 19:58.928
How about in your own home?

20:00.057 --> 20:02.048
How good's your word there, Dallas?

20:11.737 --> 20:13.728
Warner seems to have a solid alibi.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.656
He wouldn't offer dinner
with his wife in public if he were lying.

20:17.697 --> 20:19.688
The shrink's prints were there.

20:19.737 --> 20:22.490
I'll get the DNA order on that if I have to.

20:22.537 --> 20:26.052
I was called about the body.
They need to make room in the morgue.

20:26.097 --> 20:29.487
- Still no one to release her to?
- You tell me.

20:29.537 --> 20:33.212
We got a sister in Denver
but she's as much a mystery as Gretchen.

20:33.257 --> 20:35.248
No memorabilia in her belongings?

20:35.297 --> 20:37.333
We haven't had a chance to look.

20:37.377 --> 20:41.165
Well, you know when a good time
to do that might be?

20:44.577 --> 20:48.252
From the Greek.
Necro, death. Philia, love of.

20:48.297 --> 20:50.367
- You try it.
- Necrophilia.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.214
- Again.
- Necrophilia.

20:52.257 --> 20:55.249
Or Egyptian love,
according to Henry Miller.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.492
- Necrophilia.
- Necrophilia.

20:57.537 --> 20:58.526
Good man.

20:58.577 --> 21:01.171
Must've had fun naming her computer files.

21:01.217 --> 21:03.685
This is penis. Quotes.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.689
- Do you wanna read it or should I?
- Knock yourself out.

21:10.297 --> 21:12.288
No. That's yours.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.134
- Anylhing?
- No.

21:14.177 --> 21:18.568
OK. 'Biology Of The Amazons
by Gretchen Quinn.

21:18.617 --> 21:22.292
'There's a tiny catfish feared
more than the piranha called...'

21:22.337 --> 21:23.816
Candiru.

21:23.857 --> 21:26.417
- Say what?
- This is beautiful. Tell him.

21:26.457 --> 21:30.245
'It will swim into a man's penis
and lodge itself there

21:30.297 --> 21:32.288
'by erecting sharp spines.' Ow.

21:32.337 --> 21:36.046
That's a fish with a sense of irony.
How did you know that?

21:36.097 --> 21:40.727
In the jungle, they taught us,
'Don't hold your nose, hold your stones.'

21:41.657 --> 21:43.648
Bingo.

21:43.697 --> 21:45.210
Yearbook?

21:45.257 --> 21:47.851
- Book of poetry by Sylvia Plath.
- Of course.

21:47.897 --> 21:50.695
Overdue 20 years
from Patterson High School.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.128
We're on our way back.

21:55.177 --> 21:58.328
The victim's real name
was Susan Sidarsky.

21:58.377 --> 22:00.652
About 20 minutes. Right.

22:00.697 --> 22:04.246
Blood tests aren't in.
The shrink and his mouthpiece are.

22:04.297 --> 22:07.255
Let me pull the hare out for the match.

22:07.297 --> 22:10.494
Gretchen presented classic signs
of child sexual abuse.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.528
Overly promiscuous, very seductive,

22:12.577 --> 22:15.296
constantly asking me if I found her attractive.

22:15.337 --> 22:17.134
Did you?

22:17.177 --> 22:21.648
She told me that her father started
abusing her after her 13th birthday.

22:21.697 --> 22:25.087
- Abusing her how?
- Oh, must I be clinical? Come on.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.128
Yes. You must.

22:27.177 --> 22:29.168
Emotional abuse? Fondling?

22:29.217 --> 22:31.208
- What?
- Intercourse.

22:31.257 --> 22:33.851
In less clinical words, you mean rape.

22:35.137 --> 22:38.049
And the minute she graduated, she ran.

22:38.097 --> 22:40.372
She moved almost every year.

22:40.417 --> 22:44.615
She stopped running when she got to
New York. How often did you see her?

22:44.657 --> 22:46.807
As a patient?

22:46.857 --> 22:48.848
- Yes, as a patient.
- Twice a week.

22:48.897 --> 22:51.365
That must get expensive, no?

22:51.417 --> 22:54.648
She had a trust fund,
although she refused to touch it.

22:54.697 --> 22:56.892
I billed her insurance.

22:56.937 --> 23:00.725
About her sexual experiences...

23:00.777 --> 23:03.371
Well, it was anonymous

23:03.417 --> 23:06.011
and joyless with her.

23:06.057 --> 23:10.255
She'd take any man as long as she
picked him before he decided on her.

23:10.297 --> 23:14.290
- A history of deranged lovers.
- Any one of whom could've done it.

23:14.337 --> 23:17.534
Well, thank you for being so open with us.

23:17.577 --> 23:21.331
But you left out the part
where you were her last deranged lover.

23:21.377 --> 23:23.049
That's unfair.

23:23.097 --> 23:26.772
So's sleeping with
a vulnerable patient who trusted you.

23:26.817 --> 23:30.014
Listen, I never... I, er...

23:30.057 --> 23:32.048
What?

23:32.097 --> 23:34.691
- I never meant to betray her.
- Yeah, but you did.

23:35.697 --> 23:39.531
I think the psychiatry board
will take a dim view of your betrayal.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.574
There's signs all over school
about 'stranger danger'.

23:43.617 --> 23:46.927
How do you warn 'em about
people they're meant to trust?

23:46.977 --> 23:50.367
Priests, Scout leaders, future therapists.

23:50.417 --> 23:54.410
How do you tell children about this
without having them be paranoid?

23:54.457 --> 23:58.655
- We've had this talk before.
- I know. It's just...

23:58.697 --> 24:01.769
Maureen got a B in Algebra,
which is a minor miracle.

24:01.817 --> 24:05.492
Kathleen's orthodontist
said we mightn't need a whole retainer.

24:05.537 --> 24:07.846
- So that should help.
- That's good.

24:07.897 --> 24:10.411
Her therapist wasn't the only one doing her.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.408
Her father.

24:14.737 --> 24:16.728
- Her father?
- Yeah.

24:18.537 --> 24:22.166
Elizabeth made you a Play-Doh ashtray.

24:22.217 --> 24:24.208
I don't smoke.

24:24.257 --> 24:26.248
- Course not.
- Oh.

24:26.297 --> 24:28.288
That's nice. Where is it?

24:28.337 --> 24:30.407
Dickie flushed it down the toilet.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.448
Oh. Little prince.

24:36.457 --> 24:38.448
How could anyone...?

24:41.937 --> 24:44.326
Her father...

24:48.417 --> 24:50.408
- Olivia.
- Oh, good morning.

24:50.457 --> 24:53.255
- The sister from Denver's here.
- In the unit?

24:53.297 --> 24:57.290
New York. Two-bed suite, midtown.
She's not exactly warm and bubbly.

24:57.337 --> 25:00.534
- Grief does strange things to you.
- I don't think it's grief.

25:00.577 --> 25:02.568
Two sisters, same abusive household,

25:02.617 --> 25:05.609
what are the chances
it only happened to one of them?

25:05.657 --> 25:08.455
Probably very slim. Damn it.

25:08.497 --> 25:11.250
The vic went to great lengths
to escape her family.

25:11.297 --> 25:15.449
To escape her father. Changing her
name from Susan to Gretchen.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.692
Gretchen never met Daddy Sidarsky.

25:17.737 --> 25:19.728
She ran to a different city.

25:19.777 --> 25:23.372
She ran from man to man
trying to find comfort.

25:23.417 --> 25:25.726
Necrophilia's not only with dead people.

25:25.777 --> 25:28.132
- See what you started?
- I got it off the net.

25:28.177 --> 25:31.965
Supposedly some Hollywood actor
hires hookers to lie in an ice bath.

25:32.017 --> 25:34.485
He waits till they turn blue
before diving in.

25:34.537 --> 25:37.495
Let's move on. Compulsive onanism.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.334
Onanism.

25:39.377 --> 25:42.972
Hey, the Quinn girl's sister, she's here.

25:43.017 --> 25:45.008
- Got the release forms?
- Uh-huh.

25:47.017 --> 25:50.692
Mrs Travis. Olivia Benson.
My partner Elliot Stabler.

25:50.737 --> 25:53.934
- We're working your sister's case.
- Oh.

25:53.977 --> 25:55.968
Why don't you have seat?

25:56.017 --> 25:58.815
These are the keys
to your sister's apartment.

25:58.857 --> 26:02.088
If you'd like to drop by,
maybe take some family items...

26:02.137 --> 26:05.049
- Not that there'll be any.
- Why do you say that?

26:05.097 --> 26:07.930
I haven't talked to my sister in over 20 years.

26:07.977 --> 26:11.856
About two months ago, she called me,
saying she wanted a relationship.

26:11.897 --> 26:13.808
And?

26:13.857 --> 26:17.645
It was superficial... to say the least.

26:17.697 --> 26:19.494
And then it stopped.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.335
You're the only relative
we've been able to locate.

26:22.377 --> 26:25.414
Your sister was somewhat of a mystery.

26:25.457 --> 26:28.210
She was a drama queen, Detective.

26:28.257 --> 26:30.248
No one could ever figure her out.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.767
I thought she was nine years old
when you left for Colorado.

26:33.817 --> 26:36.490
Well, nine-year-old girls are complicated.

26:37.537 --> 26:39.971
Tell me about it.

26:40.017 --> 26:43.009
You can use the phone
to call relatives about the funeral.

26:43.057 --> 26:45.252
Our father's dead. And what funeral?

26:45.297 --> 26:49.768
I'm here sign the papers, go to Saks
and take the next plane home.

26:51.537 --> 26:55.052
Well, we won't keep you any longer.
Thank you for your time.

26:58.537 --> 27:01.005
Well, she was molested. You know that.

27:02.017 --> 27:05.407
- That cold façade of hers...
- I think it's living in Colorado.

27:05.457 --> 27:09.211
She dresses more Fifth Avenue
than Rocky Mountain.

27:09.257 --> 27:11.725
I'm having a fashion-police blackout.

27:11.777 --> 27:16.487
That outfit. Gretchen's shrink said
she never touched her trust fund.

27:16.537 --> 27:18.732
- But this one...
- It's...

27:20.537 --> 27:22.528
Who's paying?

27:23.537 --> 27:25.255
Who's paying?

27:25.297 --> 27:28.494
Don't you people
have computer files of your own?

27:28.537 --> 27:32.530
Yeah. 20,000 known sex offenders,
all cross-referenced by proclivity

27:32.577 --> 27:34.966
- and physical characteristics.
- That true?

27:35.017 --> 27:37.815
We can give you
every pederast in Manhattan

27:37.857 --> 27:40.849
but this case
is out of our area of expertise.

27:40.897 --> 27:45.413
Trent Peterson. Benson, Stabler.
Benson, Stabler, Smith and Fenwick.

27:45.457 --> 27:48.847
- How can I help you?
- I told them about the new system

27:48.897 --> 27:52.890
and how you can get financial data
on anybody in the free world, right?

27:52.937 --> 27:55.735
Yes. But did the ME clear this?

27:55.777 --> 27:59.452
Peterson, I'm on a deadline.
The Sidarsky Trust.

27:59.497 --> 28:03.285
The sister is dipping into the vic's
trust fund? Is that what we got?

28:03.337 --> 28:07.330
No. She had her own account.
Gretchen's just sat there and grew.

28:07.377 --> 28:09.971
- Grew how?
- 3.5 million and still climbing.

28:10.017 --> 28:13.214
Really? That's a lot of money
and a lot of motive.

28:13.257 --> 28:16.454
- What's this, the inheritance?
- It's a trust.

28:16.497 --> 28:18.886
A living trust, managed by her father.

28:18.937 --> 28:22.612
Whoa! Wait a minute.
I thought you said the father was dead.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.648
We were misinformed.

28:24.697 --> 28:28.895
He lives and works in New Jersey.
You wanna know his shoe size?

28:28.937 --> 28:32.612
What I wanna know
is the truth about these people.

28:37.737 --> 28:41.286
All the creative people,
marketing, in-house ad staff,

28:41.337 --> 28:43.328
that's all here in Jersey.

28:43.377 --> 28:46.494
- The sneakers are made where? China?
- For the most part.

28:46.537 --> 28:49.688
Mr Sidarsky, we're not here
on child labour violations.

28:49.737 --> 28:52.809
- We don't have any secrets here.
- Oh, we all have secrets.

28:52.857 --> 28:55.894
Er, could you please enlighten me?

28:56.897 --> 28:59.775
Your daughter's dead, Mr Sidarsky.

29:02.217 --> 29:04.173
What?

29:04.217 --> 29:06.287
No! No!

29:08.337 --> 29:12.330
Erm, does my wife know?
I have to call my wife.

29:12.377 --> 29:15.687
Somebody threw her out of a window
on East 82nd Street.

29:15.737 --> 29:17.329
What?

29:18.137 --> 29:20.526
T-That's impossible.

29:20.577 --> 29:24.889
My family are vacationing.
I was supposed to meet them on Friday.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.132
We have a positive ID, sir.

29:27.177 --> 29:30.135
Your second child. Born May 10th 1967.

29:31.497 --> 29:33.806
This is Susan.

29:35.497 --> 29:38.489
Susie was lost to me a long time ago.

29:39.857 --> 29:42.052
Such a sad child.

29:43.337 --> 29:45.328
Such a sad ending.

29:47.817 --> 29:49.933
Well...

29:53.737 --> 29:55.887
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

29:55.937 --> 29:57.928
I'd like to slap the crap outta him.

29:57.977 --> 30:01.970
Even if the sister came forward,
the statute of limitations is long gone.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.053
- Maybe not.
- Meaning?

30:04.097 --> 30:07.885
We pump her memory, it could start
the clock on the emotional abuse.

30:07.937 --> 30:09.928
Recovered memory is such a rat hole.

30:09.977 --> 30:12.571
- It's worth a shot.
- It's not gonna help our case.

30:12.617 --> 30:16.132
Maybe he's not our killer.
We slap a molestation case on him.

30:16.177 --> 30:20.455
I'm worried about that little girl
by the shore waiting for 'Daddy'!

30:20.497 --> 30:24.649
Who's got a mother, who's still alive
and who we hope is paying attention.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.485
Hope? Hope isn't good enough, Elliot.

31:03.897 --> 31:06.411
I thought you didn't drink.

31:06.457 --> 31:08.448
I don't. Doesn't mean you can't.

31:08.497 --> 31:10.488
I'm fine.

31:11.497 --> 31:15.410
Elliot's home with Kathy and the kids
and Munch is out somewhere.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.415
Jeffries and Cassidy...

31:18.457 --> 31:21.813
When we leave here,
we just disappear into the night.

31:23.137 --> 31:27.733
Back in Homicide, we used to go out
every night and get smashed.

31:27.777 --> 31:30.974
We'd tell war stories,
maybe fool around a bit,

31:31.017 --> 31:33.577
and feel like crap the next morning.

31:33.617 --> 31:36.575
- This is better.
- Oh, much.

31:38.017 --> 31:40.406
So why are you alone tonight?

31:45.137 --> 31:49.130
My wife was on an Orlando turn-around.

31:49.177 --> 31:51.645
She was a flight attendant.

31:51.697 --> 31:57.408
I was home scrubbing algae off the tiles
around the swimming pool we never used.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.767
The one that got me in hot water
with Internal Affairs

32:00.817 --> 32:03.206
because what's a cop doing with a pool?

32:05.137 --> 32:07.128
And then the phone rang.

32:08.137 --> 32:11.288
The call she always expected.

32:11.337 --> 32:13.328
Always dreaded.

32:14.817 --> 32:18.776
So Marge is, erm,

32:19.777 --> 32:22.450
scattered in bits over some swamp.

32:24.137 --> 32:27.129
And I'm home in Bensonhurst,

32:27.177 --> 32:30.567
trying to make sense of
the test pattern on our giant TV.

32:33.137 --> 32:35.605
Wanting so bad to drink again.

32:36.617 --> 32:38.608
Hoping for a surrender.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.012
Oblivion.

32:44.057 --> 32:46.252
Kinda like our girl, the vic.

32:48.137 --> 32:52.574
She slept with every guy on the block
just to get to that place.

32:53.617 --> 32:55.608
Oblivion.

32:55.657 --> 32:59.889
You get inside her head, Olivia,
and you will get to the perp.

33:03.977 --> 33:08.368
Whatshisface, Warner, he's got a solid alibi.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.614
Half the Upper East Side
know he's stepping out on his wife.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.535
- What's the motive?
- Then it's the shrink, yes?

33:14.577 --> 33:15.976
No!

33:16.017 --> 33:18.736
Again, motive?
He did some damage, I'll admit.

33:18.777 --> 33:20.768
Uh-uh. Psychic damage.

33:20.817 --> 33:23.251
Where'd you get that? The Psychic Hotline?

33:23.297 --> 33:25.891
Hey, he raped her emotionally.
But killed her?

33:25.937 --> 33:29.088
- No way.
- OK, then, who?

33:29.137 --> 33:31.128
I say take a look at the father.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.896
The father who hasn't
seen her in 20 years. Why?

33:33.937 --> 33:36.087
Because she was hiding from Daddy.

33:36.137 --> 33:39.527
The shrink said the old man
was cunning and still patient.

33:39.577 --> 33:41.568
He finds out she lives in Manhattan,

33:41.617 --> 33:44.848
tells the new wife
he's got an errand to run in the city,

33:44.897 --> 33:48.048
he goes, 'It's Daddy,'
and throws her out the window?

33:48.097 --> 33:52.295
Mark Daniels, the psychotherapist,
was at the crime scene.

33:52.337 --> 33:56.216
We've got his prints on a wine glass
and a pack of ribbed ultra-thins.

33:56.257 --> 34:01.047
So, would somebody please tell me
why he is not in interrogation

34:01.097 --> 34:03.770
being sweated by two of my best detectives?

34:03.817 --> 34:07.366
It wasn't him. It was her father.

34:07.417 --> 34:11.534
What if she did cash
one of her trust-fund cheques?

34:11.577 --> 34:14.614
That's how he found her.
So he goes to her apartment.

34:14.657 --> 34:17.694
She's banging the shrink or the anchorman.

34:17.737 --> 34:20.534
He's possessive, jealous, all the usual crap.

34:20.577 --> 34:24.364
The new daughter, the young one,
that's where his focus would be.

34:24.417 --> 34:27.215
Maybe she was writing
about her pathetic childhood.

34:27.257 --> 34:29.248
Everybody else is.

34:29.297 --> 34:31.936
You've got to get that sister to talk.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.373
Be my guest.

34:37.137 --> 34:40.254
Mrs Travis, what time's your flight leave?

34:40.297 --> 34:42.969
Soon. Not soon enough, but soon.

34:43.056 --> 34:46.652
I'm sure your children are anxious
to see their mommy again.

34:46.697 --> 34:48.688
They are, so if you wouldn't mind...

34:48.737 --> 34:52.092
I wanted to say
I'm sorry we were so rough on you.

34:52.137 --> 34:56.130
You're wondering why I didn't stay
and protect my little sister, right?

34:57.137 --> 34:59.128
I'm sorry.

34:59.177 --> 35:02.169
Wait! Please don't go. Please.

35:02.217 --> 35:05.573
Did you know that you have
a little half-sister?

35:05.617 --> 35:08.927
She's ten.
You know what will happen to her.

35:08.977 --> 35:12.447
- No.
- The same thing that happened to you.

35:12.497 --> 35:14.488
It was her drama, not mine.

35:14.537 --> 35:16.892
Please. Just listen to me.

35:16.937 --> 35:19.132
It's your drama too.

35:19.177 --> 35:21.372
Please, we can help.

35:21.417 --> 35:23.169
I have to go.

35:23.217 --> 35:27.415
Just one more day. In a lifetime.

35:38.137 --> 35:41.334
Can you imagine being a little girl
in his house?

35:52.337 --> 35:54.328
'Don't touch me.'

35:54.377 --> 35:56.572
- 'I only...'
- 'Only what?

35:57.577 --> 35:59.727
'Only want to make me feel better?'

35:59.777 --> 36:02.610
- Can we use this?
- Let's just see where it goes.

36:02.657 --> 36:04.648
You bastard.

36:04.697 --> 36:07.973
You cowardly, disgusting,

36:08.017 --> 36:10.008
sick bastard.

36:10.057 --> 36:12.651
- Ellie, honey, sweetie pie.
- Shut up.

36:12.697 --> 36:16.736
Is that what you call your new one?
Your little sweetie pie?

36:17.737 --> 36:21.412
'Give Daddy a taste of that sweet pie.'

36:21.497 --> 36:23.692
Is that what you think you'll do?

36:23.737 --> 36:25.728
I don't know what you're saying.

36:25.777 --> 36:27.449
No?

36:27.497 --> 36:30.250
You killed Susie. How's that?

36:30.297 --> 36:32.288
You killed her.

36:32.337 --> 36:35.170
Listen, I, er, talked to the police.

36:35.217 --> 36:39.210
I wasn't anywhere near the city on that night.

36:39.257 --> 36:41.646
Not that night.

36:42.937 --> 36:45.326
Not the other night.

36:45.377 --> 36:50.132
Honey, I think you're
making a rather costly mistake.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.008
The trust fund.

36:56.897 --> 36:59.286
Is that what you're threatening me with?

37:00.737 --> 37:02.534
Oh, Daddy.

37:05.737 --> 37:07.853
Stick it up your ass.

37:07.897 --> 37:09.888
You know what Susie called it?

37:09.937 --> 37:12.531
Blood money.

37:14.017 --> 37:17.009
From the first time she bled
when you held her down.

37:17.057 --> 37:19.048
- OK.
- Just like you held me down.

37:19.097 --> 37:23.090
That's enough. It's ancient history.
Just let it rest.

37:25.737 --> 37:27.728
I've got news for you, Daddy.

37:29.137 --> 37:31.571
It's not ancient history.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.177
That woman detective you met?
I met her too.

37:34.217 --> 37:37.015
She convinced me to stay.
And guess what?

37:38.337 --> 37:42.296
She says that if I remember things now,

37:42.337 --> 37:47.331
a judge in New Jersey
will tell my story to a grand jury.

37:47.377 --> 37:50.972
OK, listen, honey. Please.
I've got a new family.

37:51.017 --> 37:53.815
I know. That's why it's all come back up.

37:53.857 --> 37:56.325
Just as if it happened yesterday.

37:58.137 --> 38:00.332
Which is how it feels to me

38:00.377 --> 38:04.575
every day of my life.

38:14.137 --> 38:15.729
What is that?

38:15.777 --> 38:19.087
My sister wrote this.
She mailed it to Denver.

38:19.137 --> 38:22.015
My husband, whom you'll never meet,
faxed it here.

38:22.057 --> 38:24.571
- Shall I read it?
- What good would it do?

38:24.617 --> 38:26.608
Do me some good!

38:29.577 --> 38:31.408
And Susie.

38:35.937 --> 38:37.928
'Gretchen Quinn,

38:39.537 --> 38:41.926
'born Susan Sidarsky,

38:43.737 --> 38:46.331
'a frequent contributor
to the New York Ledger,

'She hopes her death will point
the finger at the men responsible.

38:53.737 --> 38:56.535
'In the end,
nothing appealed to Miss Quinn.

38:56.577 --> 38:58.886
'No food, book or person.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.327
'She couldn't stand her thoughts
or the touch of her skin.'

39:02.377 --> 39:05.733
- What is this?
- Susie's obituary. She wrote it.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.445
'She is survived

39:09.497 --> 39:11.965
