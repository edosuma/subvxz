00:03.790 --> 00:05.850
Daddy, how can you even think
about retiring early?

00:06.030 --> 00:09.900
I'm in middle of a holiday shopping season.
Are you mad?

00:10.530 --> 00:14.060
I simply said I was considering it.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.670
I hope you do retire, that way
you can spend more time around the house.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.140
He's here plenty.

00:23.080 --> 00:27.570
You can't do this, big guy.
Money, we need money.

00:28.020 --> 00:31.540
Carlton, you know we can afford this.
You're the one who helped me invest.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.520
My money makes money. We're rich.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.660
- That's right, we are rich.
- Never thought about it like that.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.260
CARLTON:
Cool.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.760
If we're so rich...

00:46.770 --> 00:49.260
...why we can't afford no ceiling?

WILL:
Look, there's no problem here. Hey.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.479
- Hi, Mr. Banks.
PHIL: Hi, kids.

02:10.650 --> 02:13.210
Stop worrying, go to work,
I will handle your father.

02:13.390 --> 02:16.020
Will, you don't know my father.
He's very overprotective.

02:16.190 --> 02:18.890
Last time one of my boyfriends
spent an evening with him...

02:19.060 --> 02:20.550
...it ended our relationship.

02:20.730 --> 02:22.530
So, what?
You never saw the guy again?

02:22.700 --> 02:25.330
No, no one did. He left town.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.200
At least that's what my dad
told the police.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.660
I think you're exaggerating a little bit.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.600
Okay, maybe a little.

02:32.770 --> 02:35.170
But, just in case...

02:35.340 --> 02:38.470
...it's been really nice knowing you.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.550
Go on, girl, get out of here. Hiyah!

02:41.150 --> 02:43.670
- Bye, Mr. Banks.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

02:43.850 --> 02:46.880
So you're gonna meet Lisa's father
tonight, huh?

02:47.060 --> 02:49.350
Yeah, he's in at 4:30 from Cleveland.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.720
I remember the first time
I met Vivian's father.

02:51.890 --> 02:55.890
He was an obstinate, dictatorial
old tightwad. We didn't get along at all.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.290
Really? Even with all that in common?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.700
I'm serious, Will.

02:59.870 --> 03:03.400
Wasn't till the day he died that
he did something to improve the situation.

03:03.570 --> 03:06.340
- Really? What did he do?
- He died.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.970
But the point is,
first impressions can last forever.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.410
So you be careful tonight.

03:11.580 --> 03:14.210
No, don't worry about me,
I'm gonna just be myself.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.320
Let the charm take care of it for me.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.610
Will, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

03:18.790 --> 03:22.920
You see, your charm
is kind of an acquired taste. Like liver.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.720
- What you talking about? You hate liver.
- Exactly.

03:28.460 --> 03:31.160
So, what?
What, are you saying I shouldn't be myself?

03:31.330 --> 03:34.860
Oh, let me just leave you alone
with your thoughts, huh?

03:36.340 --> 03:37.810
CARLTON:
Big guy, why aren't you at work?

03:37.970 --> 03:42.170
Decided to take a few days off this week
to see what it would be like if I retired early.

03:42.340 --> 03:45.800
ASHLEY: So that's still a possibility?
- A very strong one, honey.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.150
Guys, we have to do something
about Dad.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.310
Listen, I've tried, but he likes that shirt.

03:55.190 --> 03:59.130
No, I mean we have to try to discourage
this whole early retirement thing.

03:59.430 --> 04:00.990
I thought you were all for it.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.530
I was, but I've been thinking,
if Dad has more time around the house...

04:04.700 --> 04:06.830
...I'm the one
he's gonna be spending it with.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.060
- Why you?
- I'm his favorite.

04:10.270 --> 04:12.300
His favorite what?

04:12.470 --> 04:15.440
His favorite child, his little girl.
I thought it was obvious.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.980
Well, think again, little sister.
You are not Dad's favorite.

04:20.149 --> 04:21.880
That's right, Ashley, I am.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.020
You? Pfft!

04:25.090 --> 04:28.210
Hey, it's a known fact
that the oldest is always the favorite.

04:28.390 --> 04:32.120
- Mom and Dad got it right the first time.
- Then why did they keep trying?

04:34.130 --> 04:36.930
Well, you're both wrong. It's me.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.290
[ASHLEY & HILARY LAUGH]

04:38.470 --> 04:41.560
Wait, wait, wait, you cost Dad money.
I make Dad money.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.500
And Daddy's little girl doesn't mean beans
next to a chip off the old block...

04:45.670 --> 04:47.340
...which is me.
- And Nicky.

04:47.510 --> 04:51.140
Nicky's only been around a few years,
Daddy hardly knows him. It's me.

04:52.110 --> 04:54.380
Well, there's a simple way to find out.

04:54.550 --> 04:57.380
Dad's will.
Whoever gets the most wins.

04:57.550 --> 05:00.150
That's ridiculous.
More money doesn't mean more love.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.850
We're all his children, right?

05:02.020 --> 05:04.420
Don't know,
I'm starting to think you were adopted.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.820
Come on, let's find that will.

05:13.270 --> 05:17.030
Hey, listen, Mr. Wilkes,
I want you to order anything that you want.

05:17.210 --> 05:18.670
Price is no object.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.140
Yeah, yeah,
I heard you the first six times.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.580
Oh. You know,
they're known for their lemon soup.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.250
Sir, that's a finger bowl.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.850
Oh, my fault, my fault.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.120
Excellent.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.530
You know, Will,
I don't know about this place.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.560
See, I'm more of a pizza guy.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.360
Oh, well, they got pizza.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.830
What do you want on it?

05:50.010 --> 05:52.670
What, a tandoori duck? Grilled pheasant?

05:53.110 --> 05:56.600
For 24 bucks,
I want a 20-dollar bill on it.

That is so...

It was fu...

06:07.360 --> 06:11.220
So Lisa says
you're an automotive technician.

06:11.390 --> 06:14.020
No, I'm not. I fix cars.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.720
I manage a garage.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.560
A garage. Wow, that is so interesting.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.900
No, it's not. It's a job.
Hey, but I like working with my hands.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.270
It gives me the feeling
I'm earning my money...

06:26.440 --> 06:29.270
...instead of having it just handed to me.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.340

No, you don't.

06:41.390 --> 06:45.120
...but personally,
I think you're a bourgie little toad.

06:45.290 --> 06:46.920
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.090
I'll catch a bus back to Lisa's house.

Look, please?

Mr. Wilkes, I like your daughter
more than any other girl...

07:07.920 --> 07:09.780
...that I've ever been with in my life.

07:10.220 --> 07:13.120

a good impression on you.

with each other...

took my Yvonne...

and introduce me to the real Will Smith?

we weren't taking any money.

All right, Geoffrey,
what's it gonna cost to keep you quiet?

08:50.790 --> 08:53.910
Considering the magnitude
of this betrayal of your father's trust...

with a nice dinner tonight, huh? My treat.

- Then great, pick me up at 7.
