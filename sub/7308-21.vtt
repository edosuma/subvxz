WEBVTT

00:05.797 --> 00:07.341
We're thrilled you
decided to stay with us,

00:07.508 --> 00:10.636
and just so you know,
we got free local phone calls,

00:10.802 --> 00:13.013
daily in-room coffee
and an AM-FM radio.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.015
- ls it clean?
- Of course, it's clean, Lillian.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.936
Well, the last time we were here,
l saw a cockroach, Albert.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.938
That wasn't a cockroach.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.066
All of the sudden, you're an expert?

00:24.233 --> 00:26.151
l'm an entomologist, 32 years.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.070
l think l'd know a cockroach
if l saw one.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.948
l assure you, our rooms are maintained
to the highest standards of--

00:31.114 --> 00:32.658
Cockroach habitability?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.118
l was gonna say
cleanliness and neatness.

00:35.953 --> 00:39.456
However, if you folks are unhappy
with the room in any way--

00:39.623 --> 00:41.625
Stay single.

00:41.392 --> 00:44.478
Just let me know and l can see
about getting you an upgrade.

00:49.859 --> 00:53.612
l think we'll take that upgrade.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.165
ln my opinion,
the risk of serious injury is substantial.

01:46.332 --> 01:49.335
l agree. But there are protocols
that have to be followed.

01:49.502 --> 01:52.880
Which are useless if it doesn't impart
a tactical advantage.

01:53.422 --> 01:58.844
Don't underestimate appearances.
l have known entire missions to fail

01:59.011 --> 02:01.847
because an asset
didn't button her lapel properly.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.185
l see your point.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.645
So we are in agreement?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.483
- Heels.
- Heels.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.571
l hate court.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.866
Your sacrifice is noted
and appreciated.

02:22.118 --> 02:23.410
Let's talk outfits.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.038
l say you just go with the heels.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.583
Was that inappropriate? Sorry.

02:30.209 --> 02:31.961
Nice Jimmy Choo's there, Abs.

02:32.128 --> 02:33.921
Can we help you, Agent DiNozzo?

02:34.088 --> 02:36.173
Yes, l've come to collect
Officer David.

02:36.340 --> 02:37.591
Boss got the Bat-signal.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.011
l showed up just in time.

02:41.178 --> 02:43.848
Another minute and you guys would've
been braiding each other's hair.

02:44.014 --> 02:46.058
And who knows where
that can lead to, Tony.

02:46.225 --> 02:47.768
- Where are we going?
- Little Creek.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.856
- Little Creek Base?
- lt's a off-base Navy lodging facility

02:52.022 --> 02:55.192
used mostly by TDY personnel
and visiting family.

02:55.359 --> 02:57.027
Apparently, there was
some kind of bloodbath.

02:57.194 --> 02:58.737
Mondays. What's the body count?

02:58.904 --> 03:00.948
Who said anything
about a body, DiNozzo?

03:09.248 --> 03:10.332
Redrum?

03:10.499 --> 03:15.463
All we're missing is a kid on
a Big Wheel and a man in a bear suit.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.674
And in your head
that makes sense to you?

03:18.841 --> 03:22.303
<i>Yeah, it's The Shining, Ziva.</i>

03:22.120 --> 03:24.914
Now that you mention,
what was that guy doing in a bear suit?

03:26.124 --> 03:28.626
l'm just saying that this wouldn't
have happened at the Marriott.

03:28.793 --> 03:32.213
Excuse me for not checking
the axe-murderer policy.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.633
Did you request this specific room
when you called the lodge?

03:35.800 --> 03:39.345
No, we requested the one
with the eviscerated squirrels,

03:39.512 --> 03:40.638
but this is all they had.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.473
What the hell kind
of question is that?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.808
Our last one.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.978
Did l mention we have over a hundred
channels in crisp, clear cable?

03:47.145 --> 03:48.187
Talk to me, DiNozzo.

03:48.354 --> 03:51.149
Occupants checked out two days ago.
Room was cleaned yesterday,

03:51.315 --> 03:53.401
- then locked tight.
- No sign of forced entry?

03:53.568 --> 03:56.696
No, but a previous guest could have
kept the key. We're going over lists.

03:56.863 --> 04:00.116
- Field test says the blood was human.
- We don't know what parts those are.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.827
Dr. Mallard is still working
on the bathroom.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.874
l'd take an umbrella
if you go in there.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.257
lt doesn't make sense, does it, boss?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.676
lf it's a prank,
it should be animal blood.

04:18.843 --> 04:22.388
lf it's a Satanic ritual,
where are the pentagrams?

04:22.555 --> 04:24.474
Could've been
an interrogation out of control.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.727
Or a drug deal gone bad.
Look at this.

04:27.894 --> 04:31.522
How bad does a drug deal have to go
for you to leave the drugs behind?

04:32.190 --> 04:34.025
Find out what happened here.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.527
l know something of what happened.

04:38.529 --> 04:43.493
All this scattered,
organic detritus is human fascia,

04:43.659 --> 04:47.497
fibrous connective tissue
that anchors skin to muscles.

04:47.663 --> 04:53.211
lf you look closely you see
neither skin nor muscle.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.879
Yeah, l'll take your word for it.

04:55.046 --> 04:58.007
All of this tissue
was skilfully extracted,

04:58.174 --> 05:03.012
possibly during extensive
post-mortem procedure.

05:03.179 --> 05:04.639
Someone was
dissected here, Duck?

05:04.847 --> 05:07.225
More likely three someone's.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.851
And whoever the guilty party is,

05:09.018 --> 05:11.521
he didn't get his technique
from the lnternet.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.858
You're looking
for a trained medical practitioner.

05:18.903 --> 05:23.282
Well, no doctors or surgeons stayed
at the lodge in the last two months.

05:23.491 --> 05:27.078
Now checking surrounding ho--
Hotels.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.250
You missed again, Tony.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.252
Did l, McGee?

05:34.419 --> 05:37.922
Remember, goals are deceptive.

05:38.089 --> 05:41.801
The un-aimed arrow never misses.

05:43.428 --> 05:44.595
What kind of loser wrote that?

05:44.762 --> 05:47.807
- l think it's good advice.
- Really?

05:48.057 --> 05:50.560
Well, then l have
the perfect one for you.

05:52.145 --> 05:55.565
ln great attempts, it is glorious

05:56.315 --> 05:58.901
even to fail.

06:00.278 --> 06:01.612
Didn't Vince Lombardi say that?

06:03.448 --> 06:05.950
l'll hold onto that one.
But the rest of these are worthless.

06:06.117 --> 06:07.160
Nice calendar, McGeek.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.413
- Hey.
- Relax, this stuff will melt your mind.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.123
lt's not good for you.
Makes you weak.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.458
Tony, it was a gift.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.460
From who? Your wet nurse?

06:15.626 --> 06:18.629
No. From me.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.591
lt's a nice calendar, boss.

06:21.758 --> 06:23.968
Anybody find me my doctor yet?

06:24.135 --> 06:26.971
Not yet. But we do know
how he got in the room.

06:27.138 --> 06:29.348
A maid had her master key
stolen two days ago.

06:29.599 --> 06:31.184
- She see anything?
- No.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.980
l ran prints from the crime scene,
1 5 total, all from registered guests.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.357
- Only two were in the area last night.
- Bring them in.

06:38.524 --> 06:42.862
Unfortunately, they both have
airtight alibis.

06:43.029 --> 06:45.823
Looks like the un-aimed arrow
missed after all.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.325
Now that amateur hour is over,

06:47.492 --> 06:50.328
l draw your attention to the plasma
screen in the middle of the room.

06:50.495 --> 06:52.830
Psychopathic blood splatter,

06:52.997 --> 06:56.334
usually randomly scattered.
Take a look at the drips on the wall.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.171
lt's a little Jackson Pollack,
but notice anything?

07:02.340 --> 07:03.883
They're emanating
from a central point.

07:04.050 --> 07:08.179
Step off, McFlower Power.
You've had your chance to speak.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.850
They're emanating
from a central point.

07:14.811 --> 07:17.980
Then there's the TV. lt looks like
it was knocked off the bureau

07:18.147 --> 07:20.108
in a struggle of some sort, right?

07:20.274 --> 07:24.237
Except that Abby found CRT shards
in a bath mat.

07:25.363 --> 07:26.405
So?

07:26.572 --> 07:31.077
So, Dr. Giggles laid the television on
the floor, covered it with the bath mat

07:31.244 --> 07:32.954
to muffle the sound, and broke it.

07:33.121 --> 07:35.915
Crime scene was staged, boss.
Victims were killed someplace else.

07:36.082 --> 07:38.835
- Where?
- What, l gotta do all the work?

07:42.088 --> 07:44.674
- l'm gonna get right on that.
- Do that, DiNozzo.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.218
You're doing most of it anyway.

07:52.974 --> 07:56.561
l think it best to start
with a corner piece, Mr. Palmer.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.063
- Doctor?
- Haven't you done a jigsaw puzzle?

07:59.230 --> 08:00.773
You always start with the corners.

08:01.399 --> 08:06.404
- May l suggest the plantar fasciae.
- The feet?

08:06.571 --> 08:10.283
Yes, and then build it up from there.
The anterior fasciculus--

08:10.450 --> 08:16.622
Of the ankle. And then
the fascia crusis of the lower calf.

08:16.873 --> 08:19.417
Well, thank you, doctor.
That's a very helpful analogy.

08:19.584 --> 08:23.379
And a fitting one too, considering
the original term for jigsaw puzzle

08:23.546 --> 08:25.131
was ''dissected maps.''

08:25.298 --> 08:30.428
So named by the Europeans
in the late 1 760s.

08:30.595 --> 08:33.306
They used to take maps
and cut them up into irregular pieces

08:33.472 --> 08:36.058
for their children to reassemble.

08:36.225 --> 08:39.562
- Hello, Jethro, right on schedule.
- That predictable, Duck?

08:39.854 --> 08:42.732
- That thorough.
- Are we still talking three bodies here?

08:42.899 --> 08:45.568
Well, that's why we call
it ''preliminary findings.''

08:45.735 --> 08:47.945
Actually, we have the remains

08:48.112 --> 08:51.783
of at least four individuals
and perhaps considerably more.

08:51.949 --> 08:55.286
At first we thought
there might be a serial killer.

08:55.453 --> 08:56.954
Not that that is a good thing.

08:57.121 --> 09:00.291
Unfortunately, Mr. Palmer's
private hopes were dashed

09:00.458 --> 09:03.252
when l noticed
in our latest meat puzzle,

09:03.419 --> 09:07.173
traces of vascular tissue.
lt's exactly what you would see

09:07.340 --> 09:11.010
if you looked into a medical
disposal bin after surgery.

09:11.177 --> 09:13.137
That is, if you cared to look.

09:13.304 --> 09:16.307
Which apparently
our perpetrator did.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.101
Are you saying these
are medical waste?

09:18.267 --> 09:21.646
lt explains the precision
of the incisions.

09:21.813 --> 09:24.774
All or these pieces of tissue
were removed by a surgeon,

09:24.941 --> 09:29.028
disposed of, rescued,
and then put on display for reasons--

09:29.487 --> 09:31.614
Well, l will leave you to ponder.

09:33.825 --> 09:36.035
- We're being set up.
- So it seems.

09:36.202 --> 09:38.538
But set up for what?

09:44.168 --> 09:47.338
Sigmund Freud, eat your heart out.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.013
McGee, no lurking without a permit.

09:57.265 --> 09:58.683
Sorry.

09:58.850 --> 10:02.854
Just checking to see if you finished
the analysis on that powder yet.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.439
Field test said it was cocaine, but--

10:04.605 --> 10:07.984
l told you l was gonna e-mail you
the results when l was done.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.945
Yes.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.701
Don't you have court today?

10:16.868 --> 10:20.496
l'm finished.
All l had to do was give a deposition.

10:22.790 --> 10:26.210
So don't have to go back
or anything?

10:28.004 --> 10:29.046
McGee.

10:29.505 --> 10:33.134
You came all the way down here
to see me in my court suit.

10:33.301 --> 10:35.219
- No.
- You totally did.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.305
- No, l did not.
- Your mouth lies,

10:37.472 --> 10:41.100
but your red ears
are telling the truth.

10:41.851 --> 10:43.561
- What? What's wrong?
- Do you smell that?

10:44.145 --> 10:45.188
No.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.732
lt's almonds.
We have to get out of here.

10:47.899 --> 10:49.400
- What's going on?
- Cyanide gas.

11:20.807 --> 11:22.892
Hydrogen cyanide gas.

11:23.059 --> 11:25.520
Another three minutes in here,
game over.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.854
How did this happen?

11:27.021 --> 11:30.191
Abby said the coke was bad.

11:30.358 --> 11:33.027
Contained potassium cyanide,
which turned gaseous

11:33.194 --> 11:35.488
when she added the--

11:35.655 --> 11:40.618
The acidified cobalt thio...

11:40.785 --> 11:44.330
- Cobalt thiocyanate.
- Cobalt ''cyothianate.''

11:44.622 --> 11:46.207
Yeah, from her drug test kit.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.251
So this was an accident.

11:48.418 --> 11:50.878
- Abby doesn't have accidents.
- Abby also doesn't have enemies.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.131
l mean, it's not like we're talking
about Agent DiNozzo.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.632
Hey.

11:54.799 --> 11:57.260
- Ma'am.
- The crime scene was a setup.

11:57.427 --> 11:59.554
And right now Abby's our best lead.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.264
While she and McGee
were in the showers,

12:01.431 --> 12:05.101
Ziva and l took a walk through
the world of Sciuto.

12:05.268 --> 12:07.395
Our mistress of the dark
is keeping secrets from us.

12:12.984 --> 12:15.403
This is so embarrassing.

12:15.570 --> 12:18.239
Okay, in my defence,
what self-respecting drug dealer

12:18.406 --> 12:21.451
cuts its cocaine
with potassium cyanide?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.911
Obviously one that doesn't care
about repeat business.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.665
Luckily, your exposure
to the gas was brief.

12:27.832 --> 12:31.502
l don't anticipate
any long-term ramifications.

12:31.669 --> 12:34.464
Better not be. You two
don't have permission to be sick.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.007
We're fine, Gibbs.

12:36.174 --> 12:38.259
The only damage done
was to my ego.

12:38.426 --> 12:40.470
lt was a newbie accident.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.181
What?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.600
We're not so sure
it was an accident, Abs.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.351
''Not sure'' meaning what?

12:47.518 --> 12:50.188
We think whoever set up the
crime scene might be after Abby.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.023
Me?

12:52.190 --> 12:55.109
Who would wanna kill me?
l mean, Tony l understand--

12:55.276 --> 12:56.319
Hey.

12:56.486 --> 12:58.112
The name Mikel Mawher ring a bell?

12:58.988 --> 13:03.284
lt should. He placed over 200 phone
calls to you in the last four months.

13:03.451 --> 13:05.328
One of them
right before the accident.

13:05.495 --> 13:08.748
- You went through my records?
- And your credit card bills.

13:08.915 --> 13:11.667
Did you really buy this guy Mawher
a straitjacket for his birthday?

13:11.834 --> 13:14.337
- Okay, slow down.
- lt sounds like you two were serious.

13:14.504 --> 13:16.547
Until she filed a restraining order
against him.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.008
l'd say the straitjacket
was a red flag there, Abs.

13:19.175 --> 13:21.552
How come we never heard
about this gentleman?

13:21.719 --> 13:26.390
Okay, l dated him last year
and things just got a little out of hand.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.185
- Did l mention the restraining order?
- Okay, a lot out of hand.

13:29.352 --> 13:32.563
Why didn't you come to me, Abby?

13:32.730 --> 13:36.192
Because, Gibbs,
l wanted him restrained.

13:36.359 --> 13:39.862
l didn't want him beaten
to a pulp with a baseball bat.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.658
And l'm embarrassed.
lt wasn't great taste in boyfriends.

13:43.825 --> 13:45.785
Yeah, l saw the Web shrine
dedicated to you.

13:45.952 --> 13:50.873
- www.myhotdarkangel.com.
- Okay, it's creepy.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.875
But that's not dangerous.

13:53.042 --> 13:56.254
He just can't accept
that it's over between us.

13:56.421 --> 13:58.673
But he's not a violent type.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.050
The guy cleans up crime scenes
for a living, Abs.

14:01.217 --> 14:02.885
l know.
That's what l liked about him.

14:03.052 --> 14:05.221
But l'm telling you, Gibbs,
he's not your man.

14:07.974 --> 14:09.767
You're gonna pay him a visit anyway.

14:12.270 --> 14:15.857
Could you pick up my red studded
dog collar when you're there?

14:24.907 --> 14:29.203
''Free decomposition odour removal
included in all double homicides.''

14:29.370 --> 14:31.247
l can see why she fell for the guy.

14:31.414 --> 14:33.124
They even have
the same taste in music.

14:47.764 --> 14:49.098
Hey!

14:50.057 --> 14:51.142
You ruined my shot.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.942
l take that back. Not bad.

15:00.109 --> 15:03.863
l'm actually redoing my before
and after shots for my new brochures.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.783
You know, ''name the crime scene,
we wipe the grime clean.''

15:09.494 --> 15:11.954
So, what do you got, huh?
Huh, sub accident?

15:12.121 --> 15:15.625
Explosive decompression?
Never worked with NClS before.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.753
Yeah, the restraining order probably
made that kind of difficult, huh?

15:18.920 --> 15:20.797
Yeah, l don't know
what you're talking about.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.340
The only reason
you're able to walk

15:22.507 --> 15:24.967
is because l never heard
about you until today.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.637
Okay, that restraining order.
Look, this is not necessary, okay?

15:28.221 --> 15:31.182
All right, l shouldn't have called her
earlier. l just wanted to apologise.

15:31.641 --> 15:33.643
You got something to apologise for,
do you?

15:33.810 --> 15:35.728
Yeah, l was a little crazy before.
l was in therapy.

15:35.895 --> 15:39.315
Okay, l found that l was projecting
my own obsession onto Abby,

15:39.482 --> 15:41.651
and therefore she did not
wanna reciprocate it.

15:41.818 --> 15:45.321
l wanted to call and apologise for any
pain and suffering l put her through.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.825
- ls Abby in some kind of trouble?
- You tell me.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.744
Oh, my God.

15:52.203 --> 15:53.538
Look familiar?

15:53.704 --> 15:55.248
No. But for two grand
l can make it look--

15:55.415 --> 15:56.666
- Hey.
- Okay, look.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.918
l don't know
what you're talking about.

15:59.085 --> 16:00.837
Okay, l'm cured now. l'm good.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.048
l'm on antidepressants.
l have a new girlfriend.

16:04.757 --> 16:07.844
Well, now all you need is an alibi
for the last two days and you're golden.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.638
Well, then l'm golden, you know?

16:10.805 --> 16:14.517
lt's been drive-by central
since the full moon, man.

16:14.684 --> 16:18.688
- All the crazies are out, you know?
- And that makes you golden how?

16:18.855 --> 16:22.525
Because l've been with DC Metro
for two whole days. That's why.

16:25.403 --> 16:26.821
The lunar effect is a myth.

16:26.988 --> 16:29.031
There is no statistical correlation

16:29.198 --> 16:32.660
between the phases of the moon
and human behaviour.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.871
That's why it would never work
with us.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.706
Because the lunar effect is a myth?

16:36.873 --> 16:40.251
No, because l'm a scientist
and he plays with voodoo dolls.

16:40.418 --> 16:42.503
But you play
with voodoo dolls, Abby.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.380
l meant it metaphorically, McGee.

16:44.547 --> 16:48.468
l don't think they actually do anything.
l play with them, you know, to relax.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.345
Well, it looks like you can put away
your Mike Mawher doll, then.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.181
Metro confirmed Mawher's alibi.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.350
He cleaned eight crime scenes
over the past four days.

16:57.143 --> 16:59.729
Been surrounded by homicide
detectives the entire time.

16:59.896 --> 17:01.731
Did any match
what we found at the Navy Lodge?

17:01.898 --> 17:03.232
Nope. Not even close.

17:03.399 --> 17:04.442
Then l'm off the hook.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.569
Not necessarily.
He could've had an accomplice.

17:06.736 --> 17:08.863
Oh, leave it to the assassin
to rain on my parade.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.948
Or maybe it was just a lab accident.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.242
l mean, really,
who would wanna kill Abby?

17:13.409 --> 17:15.578
That's true.
lt's not like someone was after Tony.

17:15.744 --> 17:18.580
Now, that's a suspect list
l wouldn't want to run down again.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.877
- l think the joke's over. We get it.
- And our suspect list, Ziva?

17:23.044 --> 17:24.753
We don't have one.

17:26.422 --> 17:30.009
But l can contact
the local medical-waste facilities,

17:30.176 --> 17:33.221
- see if anyone reported a break-in.
- DiNozzo.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.139
l'll background check
the lodge employees.

17:35.306 --> 17:38.476
Maybe someone's got a vendetta
against the cleaning staff.

17:38.643 --> 17:43.731
- McGee.
- Well, l can-- l can go check on--

17:44.190 --> 17:46.609
Boss, l'm not really sure
what l should do.

17:46.776 --> 17:49.445
Go home. Take Abby with you.

17:50.238 --> 17:54.492
Gibbs, l'm fine. l only have
one stalker and he has an alibi.

17:54.659 --> 17:56.661
l don't want you
to be alone tonight, Abs.

17:56.828 --> 17:59.956
- You're going with McGee.
- Great.

18:00.123 --> 18:02.834
Like l haven't been
traumatized enough today.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.679
Nothing like a nice, relaxing
video game to calm the nerves.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.307
Pretty good, huh?

18:18.724 --> 18:20.726
l've seen better.
Did you change your refresh rate?

18:20.893 --> 18:23.438
l downloaded new
OpenGL drivers for you.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.606
You're getting
a way higher FPS now.

18:25.773 --> 18:27.817
But l was in the bedroom,
like, a minute.

18:27.984 --> 18:30.153
l also optimized
your TCP/lP settings.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.697
lncreased your throughput
by 50 percent.

18:33.781 --> 18:35.825
Bedtime.

18:36.659 --> 18:39.203
l am going to take the sleeping bag.

18:39.370 --> 18:40.538
We're adults, McGee.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.498
We can share the same bed.

18:47.754 --> 18:50.882
lf you promise
to keep your hands to yourself.

18:51.966 --> 18:53.634
Clearly you haven't been.

18:53.801 --> 18:57.013
Your shirt smells like JLo Glow.

18:58.097 --> 19:00.892
l can't find my toothbrush.
l think it fell out in your car.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.519
That's all right. Your old toothbrush
is still in my bathroom.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.480
You kept my old toothbrush?

19:08.149 --> 19:09.400
That's a little creepy, McGee.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.028
Maybe you should take
the sleeping bag.

19:14.030 --> 19:18.117
What is creepy about it?
l just never bothered to throw it out.

19:19.035 --> 19:22.371
- What?
- This is not my toothbrush.

19:23.081 --> 19:25.875
Well, then l must have bought a
second one and forgot about it.

19:27.043 --> 19:29.378
lt's a ladybug toothbrush, McGee.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.881
That's for cute girls
named Gina Marie

19:32.048 --> 19:33.883
that bake cookies
and wear JLo Glow.

19:34.050 --> 19:37.595
Not for a quasi-manly federal agent
who carries a gun.

19:37.762 --> 19:39.055
You wanna use it or not?

19:39.222 --> 19:41.182
An anonymous toothbrush?

19:41.349 --> 19:45.436
l would rather remove my own tonsils
with Typhoid Mary's straight razor.

19:47.814 --> 19:49.857
- Where you going?
- To get my toothbrush.

19:50.024 --> 19:51.609
No, no.
You're not leaving the apartment.

19:51.776 --> 19:54.445
Why not, McGee? We both know
Gibbs is just being over-protective.

19:54.612 --> 19:56.739
l'm not worried about you.
l'm worried about me.

19:56.906 --> 19:59.617
- and if Gibbs finds out l let you leave.
- That's a good point. You go.

20:00.243 --> 20:02.078
l am not leaving you alone, either.

20:05.456 --> 20:08.918
Fine, then.
l'll just use your toothbrush.

20:13.256 --> 20:16.050
Don't open the door for anyone.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.149
- What?
- l told you not to open for anyone.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.900
- What'd you forget?
- My keys.

20:33.067 --> 20:36.946
- Why do you need keys if l'm here?
- My car keys.

20:37.113 --> 20:39.907
Now listen to me.
You do not open the door. Okay?

20:40.074 --> 20:42.952
- Not for anyone. Or l will tie you up.
- Really?

20:55.131 --> 20:57.300
Hi, Abby.

21:09.187 --> 21:10.480
l forgot how beautiful you are.

21:10.646 --> 21:13.316
- l mean, up close, l mean.
- What are you doing here, Mikel?

21:13.483 --> 21:15.151
- You're in terrible danger.
- l got that.

21:15.318 --> 21:17.945
- Oh, no. l'm here to save you.
- What are you saving me from?

21:18.112 --> 21:19.864
How could you ask that
after what happened?

21:21.324 --> 21:23.743
Oh, right. My lab.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.246
- How did you know about that?
- Can we not do this now?

21:27.413 --> 21:30.166
Wait. There you go,
playing the frightened victim again.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.335
- McGee!
- Could you not cast me as a stalker?

21:32.502 --> 21:35.463
- Believe me, the role is yours.
- Well, l'm sick of it, okay?

21:35.630 --> 21:37.298
l thought almost dying
would make you realise

21:37.465 --> 21:39.801
how much you cared about me
and how much l care about you.

21:41.177 --> 21:43.096
But l realise l was wrong.

21:43.262 --> 21:46.808
Maybe l was foolish
for trying and trying and trying.

21:46.974 --> 21:51.646
But l'm telling you,
you're gonna thank me. Okay?

21:55.149 --> 21:57.193
You still carry the handcuffs
l gave you.

21:58.486 --> 22:02.115
That's really great because
l still have the key.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.539
l'm never picking up a guy
in a cemetery again.

22:09.705 --> 22:12.291
Listen, Abby,
l just wanna start over.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.001
Mikel, go away!

22:14.168 --> 22:15.336
We had fun, didn't we?

22:15.503 --> 22:17.797
Until you bugged my phone,
you nut-job.

22:17.964 --> 22:20.716
Well, l could pick a lock too.
You forgot about that.

22:44.866 --> 22:46.033
McGee.

22:55.877 --> 22:58.755
Nothing on the statewide BOLO yet.

23:00.131 --> 23:03.009
Get off your knees.
lt's just a typewriter, McGee.

23:03.176 --> 23:07.388
No ATM transactions.
Hasn't touched his credit cards.

23:07.972 --> 23:09.265
Was a typewriter.

23:09.432 --> 23:11.517
And she messed up
my motherboard so badly,

23:11.684 --> 23:13.770
the BlOS got screwed up
and l had to do a hard reset.

23:13.936 --> 23:15.938
How traumatizing for you, McGee.

23:16.439 --> 23:18.274
Go easy on him, boss.

23:18.441 --> 23:22.111
Even a hair out of order
traumatizes McGee.

23:22.779 --> 23:24.071
Put this on the plasma.

23:25.364 --> 23:28.242
- Where's your chair?
- He doesn't deserve to sit.

23:28.409 --> 23:29.786
With that ass?

23:30.953 --> 23:33.122
Didn't find Mawher, boss.
Guy's totally disappeared.

23:33.289 --> 23:35.374
But l found this in his apartment.

23:39.754 --> 23:41.464
He's been tracking her for a while.

23:42.757 --> 23:47.053
- So much for that restraining order.
- l spoke to his supposed girlfriend.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.888
They went on one date,
he talked about Abby.

23:49.055 --> 23:50.932
l'll find out more.
We're having dinner.

23:51.099 --> 23:53.726
No, you don't eat until you find
the guy trying to kill Abby.

23:53.893 --> 23:56.104
Boss, actually,
l have an idea about that.

23:56.270 --> 23:59.315
l've been analysing the incoming
packets on Abby's system.

23:59.482 --> 24:01.901
There appears to be a shellcode.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.906
l think that Mawher's been worming
into Abby's computer

24:07.073 --> 24:08.324
to monitor her communications.

24:08.491 --> 24:11.411
- You think you can trace the worm?
- lf he tries to access it again, yeah.

24:11.911 --> 24:13.079
Coordinate with Abby.

24:14.497 --> 24:17.125
Boss, you're gonna have to try
and get her out of the elevator first.

24:28.428 --> 24:29.804
Hey, Gibbs.

24:47.989 --> 24:50.199
Did you know that only five

24:50.366 --> 24:54.662
of the two and a half million deaths
every year occur in elevators?

24:55.580 --> 24:56.664
No.

25:01.002 --> 25:03.629
Ziva gave me this.

25:03.796 --> 25:06.591
And Cynthia gave me
the pepper spray.

25:07.467 --> 25:10.011
The knuckles
are Director Shepard's.

25:14.307 --> 25:17.894
No one is going to hurt you, Abby.

25:19.562 --> 25:22.482
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

25:22.648 --> 25:23.900
Did it?

25:25.651 --> 25:27.862
Yeah. Can you say it again?

25:28.029 --> 25:29.906
Nobody's gonna hurt you, Abs.

25:36.329 --> 25:38.873
Can l stay at NClS
until you catch him?

25:40.374 --> 25:43.377
l'll move your whole lab into the
elevator if it'll make you feel better.

25:52.386 --> 25:55.556
- Singapore has infiltrated Abu Saif.
- Good.

25:55.723 --> 25:57.558
Forward this
to Sealift Command, ASAP.

25:57.725 --> 25:59.852
Right away, ma'am.

26:01.229 --> 26:03.898
l picked a bad week
to cut out caffeine.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.317
Abu Saif?

26:06.484 --> 26:09.112
Singapore's mole believes
that they've infiltrated

26:09.278 --> 26:12.198
a prepositioned ship at Diego Garcia.

26:13.699 --> 26:16.077
l'll fill you in later. How's Abby?

26:16.244 --> 26:18.579
She's scared.

26:18.746 --> 26:22.417
l thought that Mawher fellow
had an airtight alibi.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.378
- Alibi, yes. Airtight--
- ls that

26:25.545 --> 26:28.548
Jamaican blend? Yeah.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.425
Alibi, yes. Airtight, no.

26:30.591 --> 26:33.719
Last thing a homicide cop worries
about is his clean-up guy.

26:33.886 --> 26:36.722
Yeah, well, your clean-up guy
just made an interesting play.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.558
Abby's been subpoenaed again.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.226
l thought she was done
with the court.

26:40.393 --> 26:42.937
She was until the defence
got an anonymous e-mail

26:43.104 --> 26:45.273
saying that the consultant
for the prosecution

26:45.440 --> 26:47.817
- had gone into protective custody.
- Mawher must've found out.

26:47.984 --> 26:50.111
You don't use cream and sugar,
do you?

26:53.614 --> 26:56.117
Mawher must've found out
about the case from Abby's computer.

26:56.284 --> 26:58.661
And now he's trying to lure her out.

26:58.828 --> 27:01.122
Does the defence know
they're being used?

27:01.289 --> 27:02.457
They don't care.

27:02.623 --> 27:05.835
My guess is that they're gonna use
Abby's restraining order

27:06.002 --> 27:09.589
to claim that her judgment is faulty.

27:10.214 --> 27:12.008
- Her judgment?
- Yeah.

27:12.175 --> 27:15.511
The defence is gonna argue
that she makes bad choices.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.973
l don't know this defence lawyer.
l've never dealt with her,

27:19.140 --> 27:21.642
but obviously she likes to win.

27:22.393 --> 27:24.020
- She does.
- You know her?

27:24.187 --> 27:25.605
Yeah, l thought l did.

27:25.772 --> 27:27.899
lf she wants to talk to Abby,
she can do it here.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.194
Yeah, agreed. l'll pass it on.
Jethro, could you leave--?

27:31.360 --> 27:32.987
l already did, Jen.

27:37.867 --> 27:40.453
- Any luck with that trace yet, McGee?
- Nope.

27:40.620 --> 27:43.664
Maybe we should widen
the perimeter of Mawher's BOLO.

27:43.831 --> 27:46.334
- Hey, Tony.
- Not so loud.

27:46.501 --> 27:49.545
l was up all night scrounging through
that guy's garbage, for Pete's sake.

27:50.254 --> 27:53.341
l'm Jack Kerouac, baby. l'm beat.

27:53.508 --> 27:56.636
So the drive wasn't so bad.

27:56.803 --> 28:01.057
At 400 an hour, l'm sure you'll
reconsider when you get my bill.

28:02.225 --> 28:04.685
l'll take it from here. Thanks a lot.

28:04.852 --> 28:07.980
Hi. May l help you?

28:08.815 --> 28:12.360
Yes. First eat a breath mint.

28:12.527 --> 28:15.363
And then you can take me
to the over-protective candy-ass

28:15.530 --> 28:18.658
who made me come all the way
down here for a simple deposition.

28:19.909 --> 28:21.202
He's over there.

28:26.124 --> 28:27.708
l should've known.

28:29.502 --> 28:31.546
- Hello, Jethro.
- Hello, Ginger.

28:31.712 --> 28:33.673
Or should l say overzealous
defence attorney

28:33.840 --> 28:36.843
who came all the way down here
to harass my forensic scientist?

28:37.343 --> 28:38.678
Do they know each other?

28:38.845 --> 28:40.304
Nothing gets by you, does it?

28:40.471 --> 28:42.265
Harassment is illegal.

28:42.890 --> 28:47.061
- Whereas l have a subpoena.
- How about that. So do l.

28:52.608 --> 28:55.611
You want the e-mail that tipped us
to the restraining order?

28:57.071 --> 28:58.239
Why?

28:58.406 --> 29:00.408
We're hoping there's routing
information in the header

29:00.575 --> 29:01.951
that can help us trace it.

29:02.118 --> 29:04.120
Going after the whistle-blowers
now, are we?

29:04.287 --> 29:06.706
- No, just stalkers.
- Wait, wait, slow down a second.

29:06.873 --> 29:09.125
- Who's being stalked?
- Her name is Abby.

29:09.292 --> 29:12.003
And your lawyer is going
to try to use her bad taste in men

29:12.170 --> 29:13.921
to impregnate her credibility.

29:14.088 --> 29:15.798
- ''lmpugn,'' Ziva.
- Yes.

29:15.965 --> 29:18.551
What does any of this have to do
with the embezzling charges?

29:19.469 --> 29:21.971
Embezzling. Nice.

29:22.430 --> 29:23.556
How much?

29:24.766 --> 29:27.185
They say ten million,
but l'm innocent.

29:27.351 --> 29:28.728
- l was framed.
- Framed.

29:29.562 --> 29:32.273
Yes. ln your case
l actually believe that.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.941
Don't say another word.

29:36.778 --> 29:39.113
- Where's my witness?
- Where's my e-mail?

30:00.802 --> 30:01.844
Hi.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.808
Well, the e-mail will help
narrow down the DNS server

30:06.974 --> 30:08.643
but we still have a ways to go
on the trace.

30:08.810 --> 30:11.479
l thought computers were supposed
to make things go faster, McGee.

30:11.646 --> 30:13.981
They do. lt's just that
the X-originating lP address

30:14.148 --> 30:15.775
leads to a public lP address.

30:18.111 --> 30:19.654
l'll let you know
when l have something.

30:21.489 --> 30:23.658
Ziva, go home.

30:24.659 --> 30:27.203
- l'm staying if you're staying.
- l'm staying.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.666
- Well, l'm staying.
- l'm staying too.

30:32.250 --> 30:34.043
l'm sure Abby feels safer already.

30:37.338 --> 30:40.758
l see you've vacated the elevator
for the evening.

30:40.925 --> 30:44.303
lt wasn't quite so cosy in there
after an hour with Queen Boudica.

30:45.763 --> 30:48.349
Did you know that the five people that
die in elevators every year,

30:48.516 --> 30:51.352
they only spend an average
of 60 seconds in there a day?

30:51.519 --> 30:53.354
And you've already been in one
for six hours.

30:53.521 --> 30:56.315
Exactly. lncreasing my risk
by a thousand fold.

30:56.482 --> 30:57.817
l'm lucky to be alive, Ducky.

30:57.984 --> 31:01.529
Well, it's not luck when you have
Leroy Jethro Gibbs looking after you.

31:01.696 --> 31:04.907
However, one cannot be too careful
so l brought you a present.

31:05.074 --> 31:06.367
lt's a safety whistle.

31:06.534 --> 31:09.203
Emits a 1 20-decibel blast.

31:09.370 --> 31:14.333
One good blow of this and your
attacker's eardrums are shattered.

31:14.792 --> 31:17.336
Thank you, Ducky.

31:19.547 --> 31:23.009
Boss, getting a verification ping
on my tracer program.

31:23.176 --> 31:24.719
Trying to back trace.

31:25.678 --> 31:27.513
Do you think you can type
any harder, McGee?

31:27.680 --> 31:30.433
This guy's good. He's bypassed
all our authentication routines.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.019
- Ziva, you getting this?
- Yes. lt looks like Mawher

31:33.186 --> 31:34.896
accessed Abby's accounts
30 minutes ago.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.606
- McGee.
- Yeah?

31:36.773 --> 31:38.483
Used her terminal
to send an e-mail to--

31:38.691 --> 31:41.110
The Pass and lD office
on the Navy yard?

31:42.528 --> 31:44.197
He was giving himself a drive-on.

31:46.574 --> 31:47.617
Security.

31:53.790 --> 31:56.501
Jimmy, you don't have
to keep calling me. l'm fine.

31:56.667 --> 31:59.045
<i>lt's Mikel, Abby. Don't hang up.</i>

31:59.212 --> 32:00.880
Oh, great. My biggest fan.

32:01.047 --> 32:03.132
<i>Look, l know we got off
on the wrong foot.</i>

32:03.299 --> 32:04.884
The wrong foot?

32:05.051 --> 32:08.137
The only right foot
is my foot up your--

32:08.304 --> 32:10.306
<i>Abby, Abby. Listen.
l need to see you.</i>

32:10.473 --> 32:11.891
You really are insane.

32:12.058 --> 32:14.811
<i>lf you just trust me,
l promise, nothing will happen to you.</i>

32:14.977 --> 32:16.229
And if l don't? What?

32:16.395 --> 32:19.398
You're gonna tear up that nice
collage you were making for me?

32:19.565 --> 32:24.404
Let's just say you're not as safe
as you think you are.

32:33.287 --> 32:36.165
<i>Abby, somebody tried to kill you in
your own lab. You're not safe in there.</i>

32:36.332 --> 32:37.417
Oh, and let me guess.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.794
You're the only person
who can protect me.

32:39.961 --> 32:41.629
See, you're starting
to understand. Good.

32:43.214 --> 32:46.050
Kind of like that time somebody broke
into my house and stole my mail?

32:46.217 --> 32:47.718
<i>Yeah, that was pretty scary, huh?</i>

32:47.885 --> 32:50.721
Yeah, and that crazy freak
that kept slashing my tires.

32:50.888 --> 32:53.182
Yeah, l was really worried
about you then, Ab.

32:53.349 --> 32:56.853
Mikel, that was you. You slashed
my tires. You stole my mail.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.021
<i>What does that matter,
as long as it made you realise</i>

32:59.188 --> 33:01.023
you know, your true feelings
for me, Ab, huh?

33:04.068 --> 33:08.865
No, no, no. Try using the SlD instead
of the ESN for registration request.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.283
That's a good idea.

33:16.205 --> 33:18.082
- Hey.
- Abby, down!

33:18.249 --> 33:20.376
- He was right there.
- He's here, McGee, on the move.

33:20.543 --> 33:22.879
<i>MPs on scene, Tony.</i>

33:23.045 --> 33:24.505
- Are you okay?
- No.

33:24.672 --> 33:26.424
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:26.591 --> 33:28.342
Ziva, lock down the yard.
No one in or out.

33:28.509 --> 33:31.429
- We'll find him, Abby.
- Well, then l can't stay here, Gibbs.

33:31.596 --> 33:34.390
- Definitely not staying at McGee's.
- No place is safe.

33:34.557 --> 33:36.601
lf he can get on the Navy yard,
he can get anywhere.

33:36.768 --> 33:40.813
Not anywhere. Not anywhere.

33:42.690 --> 33:49.280
Nothing like a nice, quiet, dungeon-like
basement to calm the nerves.

34:03.628 --> 34:04.962
You need to sleep, Abby.

34:05.588 --> 34:07.924
l know. l tried.

34:08.091 --> 34:10.592
Every time l close my eyes,
l see Mikel.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.469
With the grain.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.973
l thought l was.

34:19.811 --> 34:25.817
l don't understand why people drink
alcohol when they're depressed.

34:25.983 --> 34:28.652
Because alcohol is a depressant.

34:30.196 --> 34:33.324
Now l'm still depressed

34:35.326 --> 34:36.619
and l'm nauseous.

34:37.495 --> 34:40.790
And really drunk.

34:44.502 --> 34:49.799
Which means that tomorrow l have to
go fight a hangover while l'm in court

34:49.966 --> 34:56.639
while some ambulance-chasing
attorney tries to attack my credibility.

34:58.808 --> 35:01.185
What is wrong with me, Gibbs?

35:01.727 --> 35:03.688
What did l do to deserve this?

35:04.856 --> 35:07.150
lt's not about you, Abby.
lt's about him.

35:09.485 --> 35:11.362
Then why do l feel so guilty?

35:11.529 --> 35:13.865
l don't know. Why do you?

35:14.031 --> 35:16.534
Because

35:17.910 --> 35:20.997
l think this might all be my fault.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.040
Maybe it is.

35:24.917 --> 35:27.462
How could you say that
to me, Gibbs?

35:27.628 --> 35:30.047
l didn't do anything wrong.

35:31.591 --> 35:36.053
Just because some defective lunatic

35:36.220 --> 35:39.390
can't get it through
his thick skull that l think

35:39.557 --> 35:44.979
he is a defective lunatic.

35:46.564 --> 35:51.402
That is not my fault, Gibbs.

35:52.612 --> 35:55.907
That's not my fault at all.

35:56.074 --> 35:58.659
This is not my fault.

36:04.123 --> 36:06.042
lt's not my fault.

36:10.421 --> 36:13.925
l see why you like
to work on your boat, Gibbs.

36:14.092 --> 36:16.511
lt's very, very cathartic.

36:26.437 --> 36:29.315
Suddenly having a stalker
on the loose isn't so scary.

36:29.482 --> 36:31.025
He's not on the loose, Abby.

36:31.192 --> 36:34.487
That's what l came down here
to tell you. DiNozzo called.

36:34.654 --> 36:37.615
The Coast Guard picked up
Mikel Mawher

36:37.782 --> 36:40.451
trying to cross the Anacostia.

36:40.618 --> 36:41.661
This is harassment. Okay?

36:41.828 --> 36:44.122
l'm gonna file a restraining order
against your department.

36:44.622 --> 36:47.792
Knock yourself out.
They did wonders for me.

36:47.959 --> 36:50.503
- lt's over, Abby.
- Not until he finds another loophole

36:50.670 --> 36:53.756
to crawl out of.
He will. You don't know him.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.508
<i>- No.
- Sit down and shut up.</i>

36:55.675 --> 36:56.968
But l know Gibbs.

36:58.094 --> 36:59.429
Excuse me, director?

36:59.595 --> 37:03.141
The Federal Marshall
is here for Abby.

37:03.307 --> 37:06.227
<i>- Just when it was getting good.
- All right, l'll sit.</i>

37:06.394 --> 37:08.771
<i>- Judges don't like to be kept waiting.
- But l want it on record</i>

37:08.938 --> 37:12.483
<i>- that it was under extreme duress.
- Noted.</i>

37:12.650 --> 37:14.902
- Let me know how it turns out.
- Don't worry.

37:15.069 --> 37:17.989
Gibbs won't let him crawl out
of anything.

37:19.615 --> 37:23.077
You guys have it all wrong.
l'm not the one trying to hurt Abby.

37:23.244 --> 37:24.829
No, you're just
the misunderstood lover

37:24.996 --> 37:27.665
who flies in at the last second
to be her saviour.

37:27.832 --> 37:30.168
- That how the game's played?
- This isn't a game.

37:30.334 --> 37:33.671
- Okay, l'm trying to protect Abby here.
- lnteresting way of showing it.

37:33.838 --> 37:35.840
No choice. lt's the only way
l can get her to listen.

37:36.007 --> 37:38.176
Abby and l have been
going through a rough patch lately.

37:38.342 --> 37:40.887
Hey. There is no Abby and you.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.264
And rough patches don't
usually include cyanide.

37:43.431 --> 37:44.515
That wasn't me.

37:44.682 --> 37:47.268
l didn't know Abby was in trouble
until after you came to my office.

37:50.688 --> 37:52.815
Look, l'm not the one trying
to hurt Abby.

37:53.274 --> 37:54.358
But l know who is.

37:55.068 --> 37:58.696
Not his name, but his picture.
Right there.

37:59.405 --> 38:02.950
After you guys came to see me, l
started to go through all my old photos.

38:03.117 --> 38:06.871
Exhibits A through G of you violating
your restraining order?

38:07.038 --> 38:08.790
lt's not illegal if l stay
1 00 yards away.

38:08.956 --> 38:12.043
lt is if you harass, follow or threaten.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.462
Semantics, okay?

38:14.629 --> 38:16.506
Anyway, l'm going
through all my old photos,

38:16.672 --> 38:18.716
and the same guy kept popping up
over and over again.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.551
That's gotta be your guy.

38:22.804 --> 38:25.014
There. Right there. Him.
The scary guy right there.

38:26.099 --> 38:29.143
That scary guy?
The really scary guy right there?

38:29.310 --> 38:30.478
No, no. The other guy.

38:30.645 --> 38:33.397
Zoom in on the other guy.
Yeah, keep going.

38:33.564 --> 38:35.525
Keep going. Keep rolling.
You see what l'm saying?

38:35.691 --> 38:37.068
l wasn't the only one following her.

38:37.235 --> 38:41.072
The only reason l was able to worm
into Abby's computer in the first place

38:41.239 --> 38:45.868
is because somebody had cracked
the authentication protocols before me.

38:49.914 --> 38:51.374
Thanks for the lift.

38:52.667 --> 38:55.169
l could really use it
after the week l've had.

38:55.336 --> 38:57.797
Don't forget your seatbelt.

39:02.218 --> 39:04.804
He's right, boss. Mawher's worm
didn't penetrate Abby's system

39:04.971 --> 39:07.473
<i>until after the authentication calls
were cracked.</i>

39:07.723 --> 39:09.934
- Who cracked them?
- Well, that's gonna take some time.

39:10.268 --> 39:11.310
We don't have time.

39:11.477 --> 39:14.188
That was the federal marshal
who was supposed to pick up Abby.

39:14.355 --> 39:16.315
- Supposed to?
- Someone slashed the tires

39:16.482 --> 39:18.568
on his transport. He hasn't left yet.

39:20.903 --> 39:24.532
So l guess the lesson is to always trust
your instincts, you know?

39:24.699 --> 39:28.703
Like with you. You scare me.
So we could never date.

39:28.870 --> 39:32.039
But don't feel bad.
l mean, you're a federal agent.

39:32.206 --> 39:35.418
You should scare people.
That's your job. You--

39:42.508 --> 39:45.219
No answer on her cell phone.

39:45.386 --> 39:46.554
Running a trace.

39:46.721 --> 39:48.389
State police have been notified.

39:49.432 --> 39:51.309
<i>- Still no answer, Gibbs.
- Keep trying.</i>

39:51.476 --> 39:53.478
- How far could he have gotten?
- Far enough.

39:53.644 --> 39:55.313
lf he knows his window's small.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.149
<i>- McGee, l'm not gonna ask again.
- Location's coming up.</i>

39:58.316 --> 40:00.526
Sending GPS coordinates
to your PDA.

40:00.693 --> 40:04.572
Okay, l got it. This can't be right.
lt says we're right on top of her.

40:04.739 --> 40:06.240
That's because we are.

40:22.048 --> 40:23.341
DiNozzo.

40:35.937 --> 40:37.480
l'll be with you in a minute, Gibbs.

40:40.441 --> 40:42.360
And don't look up my skirt!

40:49.075 --> 40:50.076
Okay.

40:51.452 --> 40:52.745
- So how'd it go?
- Horrible.

40:52.912 --> 40:55.873
The judge ruled all
of my physical evidence inadmissible.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.208
Then threw out the case.

40:57.375 --> 40:58.960
Hit you hard, huh?

40:59.127 --> 41:01.379
Actually, no. She didn't bring up
my bad taste in men.

41:01.546 --> 41:04.674
- She attacked the science.
- lt always was about the science.

41:04.841 --> 41:07.051
l only questioned you
on the restraining order

41:07.218 --> 41:09.720
to throw the prosecution
off my real game plan.

41:09.887 --> 41:12.390
Human-scent detection
is a viable forensic tool.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.851
Which has yet
to be fully vetted and peer-approved.

41:15.017 --> 41:16.894
- Lucky for me.
- Scent evidence

41:17.061 --> 41:20.064
is the only physical evidence tying
the defendant to the money he took.

41:20.231 --> 41:22.024
We're saying
you're a very smelly man.

41:22.191 --> 41:24.318
Hey, l was proven innocent,
remember?

41:24.485 --> 41:27.864
Actually, you just weren't found guilty.
There's a difference.

41:28.030 --> 41:31.159
l'll keep that in mind while l'm getting
a tan on the beaches of Bora Bora.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.578
Don't take it so hard.
l knew it was going to end like this

41:33.745 --> 41:35.246
right from the very beginning.

41:35.413 --> 41:37.582
- Too bad your client didn't.
- Yeah.

41:37.749 --> 41:39.834
You should have
trusted your lawyer there, Giggle-man.

41:40.001 --> 41:42.336
lnstead of spending
all of that money hiring a hit man

41:42.503 --> 41:45.089
to take out the star witness,
a.k.a. me.

41:45.715 --> 41:47.383
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.218
You paid him to kill.

41:49.385 --> 41:51.512
You didn't pay him
to keep his mouth shut.

41:51.679 --> 41:55.433
That dude even gave you credit for
the bloodbath at the Navy Lodge.

41:56.058 --> 42:00.271
- You guys think you're so smart.
- Terry, don't say a word.

42:01.856 --> 42:03.775
Back in the car. Let's go.

42:22.293 --> 42:24.504
l was right, wasn't l?

42:26.130 --> 42:29.050
That's right. Abby would be dead
by now if it wasn't for me.

42:29.884 --> 42:31.260
ls that what you think?

42:35.723 --> 42:38.392
l think Terry Spooner never
would've gotten as close as he did

42:38.559 --> 42:40.978
without you as a distraction.

42:41.145 --> 42:43.106
That the real danger here was you.

42:43.272 --> 42:46.067
No, no. People accuse me
of playing mind games. No.

42:46.609 --> 42:49.320
Metro Cops found your car.

42:49.487 --> 42:51.322
They found the gun.

42:52.156 --> 42:55.618
Found the suicide note you wrote
in Abby's handwriting.

42:55.785 --> 42:57.495
That was just a last resort.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.998
Look, l love her.
l love her, you know?

43:03.167 --> 43:05.294
You don't get it, do you?

43:06.003 --> 43:08.631
She wants everybody to believe
that she doesn't love me.

43:08.798 --> 43:11.008
<i>Hell, l think she
even believes it sometimes.</i>

43:11.175 --> 43:13.177
Tell you what,
if you don't care about me,

43:13.344 --> 43:16.848
<i>then how come you can't take
your eyes off me right now?</i>

43:18.516 --> 43:21.894
You can lie to the rest of the world,
you can't lie to your heart.

43:22.061 --> 43:23.104
Can you, Abby?

43:26.733 --> 43:29.819
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

43:30.361 --> 43:33.448
Abby! Abby!

43:34.031 --> 43:38.536
Look, l know you're in there. Abby!
