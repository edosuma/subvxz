00:16.808 --> 00:21.604
Jeff
Please... Please, forgive me!

00:21.688 --> 00:24.774
-I'm sorry!

00:26.693 --> 00:29.738
Please!

00:29.821 --> 00:32.991
Please forgive me!

00:33.074 --> 00:36.161
Grab your toolbox.
I wanna cut off his eyelids!

00:37.746 --> 00:41.624
-His eyelids?
-I wanna watch him suffer.
Come on!

00:41.708 --> 00:43.209
I thought you wanted me
to shoot him

00:43.293 --> 00:45.462
-after he was done
digging the hole.
-I changed my mind.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.508
Changed his mind...

00:50.592 --> 00:53.428
She tell you
how big your cock is?
Huh, Jeff?

00:53.511 --> 00:56.389
Jeff I'm sorry!

01:13.990 --> 01:16.868
I, I, I, know. I'm sorry.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.664
-Please.
-Hold up. Hold up.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.708
Hey, uh,

01:23.792 --> 01:26.044
I think we're going
to call this off.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.004
What, no eyelids?
Just shoot him?

01:28.087 --> 01:31.466
-No, I-I don't want him dead.
-Thank you.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.469
-I thought you said you
wanted to watch him suffer.
-I know,

01:34.552 --> 01:37.180
but, um, he's asked
for my forgiveness.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.683
Y-you know, he made some
valid points, so, uh,

01:40.767 --> 01:42.685
I'm forgiving Jeff.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.816
-You're forgiving Jeff.
-I'm sorry I fucked your wife.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.318
He's sorry he fucked
my wife!

01:50.401 --> 01:52.612
You know, and she's
no saint either, okay?

01:52.695 --> 01:56.241
There's a whole history
we don't need to get into. I...

01:56.324 --> 01:57.951
I think I just overreacted.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.085
There's no forgiving Jeff!

02:28.773 --> 02:30.692
Ha! Ha! Ha!

02:32.777 --> 02:34.279
Ha! Ha! Ha!

02:36.364 --> 02:38.992
Did you not come to bed
again last night?

02:39.075 --> 02:40.660
Uh, no. I had a line
on some work,

02:40.743 --> 02:43.580
but it fell through,
so I just drove around.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.540
Fun!

02:45.623 --> 02:49.002
Okay, so lunch
today's at00...

02:49.085 --> 02:51.337
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah. Can you, like,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.840
get there, like,
a little early, you know,

02:53.923 --> 02:55.675
-and watch us shoot.
-Oh...

02:55.758 --> 02:57.886
-My controller's broken.
-Oh!

02:57.969 --> 03:00.096
Hoo! Ah!

03:01.598 --> 03:04.309
Oh god. Diane's coming
to look at cuts today.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.852
Do you want me
to bring you flowers?

03:05.935 --> 03:09.230
-Yeah. Uh,
nothing yellow, okay?
-Unbelievable...

03:09.314 --> 03:11.774
And, uh, if I say
you can stay for lunch,

03:11.858 --> 03:14.068
just know that you can't.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
Love you!

03:17.822 --> 03:19.949
Fuck.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.594
Sir?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.889
-Yes?

03:42.972 --> 03:45.516
Hi. I'm Detective Mae Dunn.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.810
These are officers
Tereno and Hale.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.065
We'd like to speak to NoHo Hank.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.276
I will fetch him.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.126
I spoke to the elders,

04:12.210 --> 04:14.337
told them we needed more men.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.341
LA is us, Akhmal, and Yandar.
That's four guys.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.469
Well, SEAL Team Six
only has six guys,

04:21.552 --> 04:23.805
and they have
their own TV show.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.309
-Hank. The cops are outside.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.646
-They want to speak to you.
-Well...

04:31.729 --> 04:33.773
we always knew this
was going to happen.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.942
This one is for
all the marbles.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.360
You have your story straight?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.946
Yeah. Um...

04:40.029 --> 04:42.490
This is my
first interrogation,

04:42.573 --> 04:44.909
you know?
I'm, like, legit nervous.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.744
Alright.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.996
We don't hear from
you in two hours,

04:48.079 --> 04:50.039
-we will all take cyanide pills.
-What?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.459
-Ciao, babies.
-Wait, what?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.339
Yeah. Monastery shooting.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.549
I heard about that.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.593
Heard about it.
But, you weren't there?

05:02.677 --> 05:03.720
No.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.763
Well, we heard
that you were there.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.349
I wasn't.
Because no one survived.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.435
How would you know that
if you weren't there?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.813
I saw it on Citizen App?

05:13.896 --> 05:16.149
Can you tell me
what that pin says?

05:27.118 --> 05:30.580
It says, "The debt
has been paid."

05:30.663 --> 05:33.207
Mm-hm.
Any idea where we found it?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.084
Well, they do hand them out
at banks back home.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.795
-Hank...
-After you pay your debts.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.922
Well, we found that one
in the trunk of a car

05:40.006 --> 05:42.633
next to a detective's dead body.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.511
Wow.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.639
Wow.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.018
Wow.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.731
What the fuck?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.442
That is super fucked up.
You know?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.072
What does this have
to do with monastery?

06:04.155 --> 06:05.740
We think the cases are linked.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.745
And we can put you
outside the monastery

06:10.828 --> 06:12.997
a few days before the shooting.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.423
TouchÃ©.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.092
Dr. Watsons.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.260
Yes.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.138
These two cases are linked.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.599
Same man who shot at monastery

06:31.682 --> 06:33.142
is also fucking idiot

06:33.226 --> 06:36.062
who killed your dear,
sweet detective.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.565
That pin...

06:39.649 --> 06:42.193
is calling card for...

06:42.276 --> 06:45.696
that man.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.241
We have been
trying to identify him.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.410
If I tell you, you'd have to
pall-bear my coffin becau--

06:51.494 --> 06:53.996
Hank. I'm fed up
with the mind games.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.623
My patience was here.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.625
Now, it's here.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.460
Just tell us, Hank.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.674
His name is...

07:05.758 --> 07:07.426
-the Raven.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.011
-It's a good name.
-It's a fake name.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.263
You're saying this...

07:10.346 --> 07:13.599
Raven killed Detective Moss
and shot up the monastery?

07:13.683 --> 07:14.851
I know he did.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.229
Anytime someone
compromises Chechen operation,

07:18.312 --> 07:21.274
he's sent down by top brass
to take care of it.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.609
And he never fails.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.361
You know, you should
really Wikipedia "raven."

07:25.444 --> 07:27.405
You'll see the name works on,
like, three different levels.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.656
Okay, where do we find him?

07:28.739 --> 07:31.492
The name is not just random
is what I'm saying.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.202
Where to find him?

07:34.579 --> 07:37.707
The Raven lives in
the shadows, my friends.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.545
Who knows where he is?

08:36.974 --> 08:40.186
This time of year, in my home?

08:40.269 --> 08:42.980
Spend the weekend
watching college football.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.568
I'm assuming...

08:47.652 --> 08:50.905
streaming is a no-go.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.033
We could put, uh,
put an aerial on the roof.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.872
Ohio State! Huh?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.708
Haven't missed a game
in 25 years! Come on.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.045
Hank said you could come home
when things cool off in LA.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.799
-That the only phrase
you know in English?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.808
Hello. I'm Ana.
I got two more Flaky Critters.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.519
They have no Crunchies,
so I hope you like.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.355
Holy smokes.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.651
Mae
Mr. Cousineau, thank you
so much for coming in.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.319
We've been spending
the last six months

09:30.403 --> 09:31.612
putting our case together,

09:31.696 --> 09:33.906
and we have some
information for you.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.534
Now, I want you to look at
these photographs, please,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.119
and tell me are
any of these the men

09:38.202 --> 09:40.413
that took you out
to see Janice's body?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.419
Gene
That's the man.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.174
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.
That's the man,

09:52.258 --> 09:54.302
and he is connected to Barry.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.264
That man, Mr. Cousineau...

09:58.347 --> 10:01.809
is a Chechen assassin
they call the Raven.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.185
The what?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.980
He killed Janice.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.815
Yeah, we cleared Barry.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.693
Ever since I met that punk,
bad things have happened to me.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.862
The love of my life, dead.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.114
My acting class, dead.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.908
Mr. Cousineau, you of all people
should know what it's like

10:17.992 --> 10:20.202
to be accused of a crime
you didn't commit.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.456
From what I understand,
Berkman left
a pretty big audition...

10:47.438 --> 10:49.607
Distraught Wife
I'm a good person. I wish
I didn't have to do this

10:49.690 --> 10:52.026
but he disparaged me.
He cheated on me.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.778
He turned our children
against me.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.279
He leaves work at30.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.114
I can give you a map
of the parking lot.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.908
-It'd be great if it
looked like a mugging--
-Hey, can you--

10:58.991 --> 11:00.576
can you help me with
something for a second?

11:00.659 --> 11:02.244
Distraught
What?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.581
I'm buying flowers
for my girlfriend. Um...

11:05.664 --> 11:08.626
Do the colors mean
different things?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.336
Distraught
What?

11:10.419 --> 11:14.048
Like, does red mean love
and yellow mean happy?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.925
Distraught
How could you ask me
that right now?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.344
I mean, with everything
I'm going through? I...

11:18.427 --> 11:20.346
Are-- Are you psycho?

11:20.429 --> 11:23.432
-Look, Chloe, I just--

11:23.516 --> 11:25.601
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I did.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.020
-He cares about me.
-He's manipulating her!

11:28.104 --> 11:29.271
Direct to Chloe.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.649
He's manipulating you.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.403
Look, Chloe, you have
so much light inside of you.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.405
And when you're with him,
I just...

11:37.488 --> 11:38.906
I see it being smothered.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.491
I think what your mother
is saying

11:40.574 --> 11:44.120
is you need to be with someone
who doesn't abuse you.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.788
Well, she's one to talk.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.300
Katie Harris, who plays Chloe,
is one of ours.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.429
She's a real find.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.306
-Who? Oh, what-- that--
Was that the daughter?
-The daughter, yeah.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.560
The daughter. Yeah.
She was excellent.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.311
Yeah.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.939
Which can sometimes
bite you in the ass.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.774
-Agreed.
-Mm...

12:18.654 --> 12:21.490
Do they... live together?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.785
Does who live together?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.620
Chloe and your character.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.955
Well, they're mother
and daughter...

12:28.038 --> 12:31.459
-...so, so yes.
-Oh. Right...

12:33.002 --> 12:35.129
How do we feel about that?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.842
Did you live with your mother
when you were in high school?

12:39.925 --> 12:42.094
-I did.
-Oh, I know I did.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.345
Mine passed away early--

12:43.429 --> 12:45.681
So we're "touching" on a thing,

12:45.764 --> 12:48.976
but we're not
"commenting" on it.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.854
Right. Nice. Well done.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.273
Thank you.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.610
But, I miss that
beautiful old man.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.446
You know, the one who says...

13:01.864 --> 13:05.075
"You can't call me
names in my cafÃ©."

13:09.663 --> 13:12.917
You can't call me
names in my cafÃ©.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.045
It's the most powerful
scene in the episode.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.922
Mm-hmm.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.799
Oh, I'm thinking of
a different show.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.803
It was powerful though.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.350
Even though it wasn't
in this show.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.941
Well, just keep up
all the good work.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.527
-We're so...
-Over the moon.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.363
Thank you.
Thank you for--

13:42.446 --> 13:43.739
opportunity...

13:43.822 --> 13:46.242
Well, she didn't seem
thrilled, like, at all.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.785
No, no, no. That's just
how these meetings go.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.328
-It's positioning.
-Positioning?

13:49.411 --> 13:51.622
Yeah, so if it's a hit,
they can catch it
and take credit.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.333
And if it isn't a hit, then
they can just step aside and...

13:54.416 --> 13:55.709
-splat.
-They're ready for
the Chloe scene.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.753
-Oh, okay.
-Just remember, Sal,
it has to work.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.089
Which it will.
But, it has to.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.591
-Oh! Hey, Natalie.
-Yes?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.759
Um, listen.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.511
I can't feel
empowered as a woman

14:05.594 --> 14:07.221
if I don't bring up
other women with me.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.806
So, I'm so happy
that you're here.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.558
-Thank you.
-And I-I really
want you to learn.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.978
-Great.
-But, uh, don't talk
in meetings.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.438
-Right.
-Actually, you know what?
When I'm in a meeting,

14:16.522 --> 14:19.650
that is a great time for you
to be making my snack.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.736
-And that is where
I'm going right now.
-Great!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.405
Oh, and can you
cut up some carrots

14:24.488 --> 14:26.073
in those tiny little
bites you do?

14:26.156 --> 14:28.826
-Oh, you're just so
good at it. Thank you!

14:34.915 --> 14:37.334
-Are they ready
for the Chloe scene?
-Yeah, she's on set.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.420
Wade just wants to do
a quick run-through of
the Sally/Sam fight.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.338
-The flashback in 104?
-Yeah, that's right.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.506
-Hi.
-Hi! Um, what do you think

14:42.590 --> 14:44.091
about this for Chloe
in the dinner scene?

14:44.174 --> 14:46.218
-It's blue.
Aren't I wearing blue?
-No, this is teal.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.471
It looks blue. I think we should
be wearing different colors.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.640
-Alright, everyone,
quiet on rehearsal!
-Hey, took your notes,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.642
made it a little more harsh.
Let me know what you think.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.645
-Great, great.
-On go. Three, two, one, go.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.358
Good. Cut. Put you in here
for your close-up.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.277
-Okay, yeah, and he'll be
yelling the whole time?
-It's up to you.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.862
Okay, yeah, he should be
yelling the whole time.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.155
-Okay.
-When do we shoot this?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.573
-First thing tomorrow.
-Okay, looks good!

15:07.656 --> 15:09.158
-Thank you!
-Moving on to Sally's
present-day house.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.909
-Uh, Swiss, Apple Watch?
-Swiss.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
For the dinner scene,
Janet doesn't eat meat.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.121
-Okay.
-But I can make
a steak out of apples.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.124
-If it looks like steak,
I'm good.
-Oh, it'll look like steak.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.754
-Hi, hi, um,
how about this one?
-Ah! Still blue though!

15:21.837 --> 15:24.715
-No, no, it's sea foam--
-Uh, just find me anything

15:24.798 --> 15:27.676
-that is not blue! Thank you!
-But it's not! It's not blue!

15:27.760 --> 15:28.844
Fuck.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.147
Assistant
Alright, everyone,
cameras up!

15:40.230 --> 15:41.565
Cameras up!

15:49.323 --> 15:51.116
-Here she is.
-Makeup on standby.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.701
Hey!

15:52.785 --> 15:55.871
-Oh! You good?
-Oh, I'm good.
I wanna get started...

15:55.954 --> 15:58.666
-Guys, I'm good.
I don't need touches.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.086
-Okay, we're in meal penalty,
so we really gotta jam.
-Fuck a duck, okay.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.505
-Let's do this thing.
-Roll sound!

16:04.588 --> 16:06.924
Okay.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.468
-You good? You wanna run lines?
-Oh, I'm good. Do you need to?

16:09.551 --> 16:12.554
I am great!
Oh my god.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.520
-- Quiet!
-Wardrobe -
How about this?

16:19.603 --> 16:20.896
-Still blue.
-And, action!

16:20.979 --> 16:23.148
How long has he been
pressuring you to have sex?

16:23.232 --> 16:25.401
For a while,
but I promised
I wouldn't do it

16:25.484 --> 16:26.902
until I knew I loved him.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.738
I think you need to know
yourself and love yourself

16:29.822 --> 16:32.533
before you can truly
love someone else.

16:32.616 --> 16:36.370
What am I supposed to do?
Wait for the perfect person?

16:36.453 --> 16:39.415
You gotta make yourself
the perfect person.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.126
Assistant
Cut! That's half-hour lunch!

16:45.754 --> 16:47.506
Could someone grab wardrobe?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.929
The key to stage
acting is doing,

16:54.012 --> 16:55.973
whereas when you're on camera,
you really just want to be.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.434
You know, it's more
about being.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.936
Oh my god! Oh!

17:01.019 --> 17:03.230
Are those for me?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.190
I got 'em from Ralphs.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.192
When's your audition?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.236
Before, uh, you guys have lunch.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.740
Oh, sucks you can't stay.
Can't you move it?

17:12.823 --> 17:15.576
You know, you're like a...
you're like kind of a dude.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.037
-It's cool.
-Oh, he is.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.470
NoHo
The cops bought it
hook, line, and a sinker.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.514
Batir
So, if we have problem
with them or Bolivians,

17:37.598 --> 17:39.141
we give them Fuches?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.810
NoHo
We pin everything on him
because he is worthless to us.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.605
-He is our patsy.
-And they
bought the name?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.940
NoHo
Oh, they were scared.
They were like,

17:47.024 --> 17:48.692
"Holy shit, he's called what?"

17:48.776 --> 17:50.194
Hmm...

17:50.277 --> 17:52.696
NoHo
Alright, I gotta run.
See you on the flippy-flops!

18:27.022 --> 18:28.732
Oh! Jesus Christ.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.693
Guess who finally got
interrogated by police today?

18:31.777 --> 18:34.822
Fuck. You scared me.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.241
-How did it go?
-Um...

18:37.324 --> 18:39.910
-I think I aced it.
-I told you. I told you, Hank.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.038
You have to envision
your future, yeah?

18:43.121 --> 18:45.457
You have to. That's the only
way it's ever going to happen.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.043
I'm telling you,
that's what I did.
I totally envisioned my future,

18:48.126 --> 18:50.796
and I think it really worked
because it worked.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.264
Hey, just so you know,
I got, like, 16 notifications

19:00.347 --> 19:03.183
about properties in Santa Fe.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.395
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on. We have the money.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.273
-Hank, there is a daydream.
-It's not daydream.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.234
I can't make anything
happen until I rebuild.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.487
Your little boyfriend Barry
killed all my buddies.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.199
-You know this.
-And you know that he killed
most of my buddies, too.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.535
I don't want to
talk about Barry.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.412
When I do, I can't sleep.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.790
-Plus...

19:26.874 --> 19:29.084
he killed all my buddies.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.378
We both had buddies killed.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.088
You have some buddies.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.508
I have no buddies.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.280
-Hey, man.
-Fuck!

19:58.947 --> 20:00.407
Barry?

20:00.490 --> 20:02.117
What the fuck
are you doing here?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
I'm sorry to surprise
you like this, Hank,

20:03.702 --> 20:05.495
-but I didn't know
where else to go, man.
-No, no, no.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.997
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.415
-You need to get the fuck out.
-Why?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.834
-Babe!
I'm going to make some tea.
-Shit.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.587
You want the usual?

20:13.670 --> 20:16.798
Can you make me
a... choco-latte?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.009
Sure.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.559
So, you and Cristobal
are an item now?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.270
Yes. What? You jealous?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.441
I was wondering if
you had any work, Hank.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.276
Uh...

20:36.360 --> 20:39.321
I've been working
with some amateurs on,

20:39.404 --> 20:42.240
you know, people hiring me off
of Craigslist, things like that,

20:42.324 --> 20:44.159
and I, uh...

20:44.910 --> 20:46.119
I could use a job,

20:46.203 --> 20:48.455
and, uh, you know,
you don't have to tell anyone

20:48.538 --> 20:50.457
you're working with me.
I under...

20:50.540 --> 20:51.708
I understand,
but I could use--

20:51.792 --> 20:54.002
You shoot up monastery.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.546
You fuck my business.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.298
You frame me using pin

20:58.382 --> 21:01.885
-I gave you for
being great dude.
-Fuck.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.429
And now you come here
to my fucking home,

21:04.513 --> 21:05.722
asking me for a job?

21:05.806 --> 21:07.808
I know, no, I know,
I know, I know.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.519
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.729
I don't know what to do, man.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.151
Look, I'm-I'm...
I'm in a bad spot.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.279
Like, I'm seeing shit
that's not there.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.657
I'm like-- I'm kinda
losing my mind, man.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.659
And I need help.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.870
I need... I need
a purpose, Hank.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.580
-You--
-Barry.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.043
Forgiveness is something
that has to be earned.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.798
And whatever shit
you're going through...

21:41.133 --> 21:43.844
I can't be part of it.

21:43.927 --> 21:47.097
I'm embracing my life.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.642
It's like that line in
"Shawshank Redemption."

21:50.726 --> 21:53.603
"Get rich, or die trying."

21:55.897 --> 21:58.567
Now, seriously. Fuck off.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.694
Try not to frame me
on the way out.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.417
-Alright, make sure you dry
that all the way off, alright?
-Okay.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.297
Hey, Dad. Uh, after work,

23:02.380 --> 23:03.882
you wanna meet us
at the park?

23:03.965 --> 23:06.301
We'll see how it goes.
Come here.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.555
Gordon, I love you
so, so much.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.265
It's all going
to be okay.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.519
-I love you, too, Grandpa.
-Yeah.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.815
-You look good.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.236
So do you.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.364
Downstairs
looks like a lot of work.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.491
It is.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.495
Must be hard, uh,
closing up this place.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.374
So, if you're not
teaching anymore,

24:19.457 --> 24:22.377
are you gonna go back
to performing or...

24:24.838 --> 24:28.425
My career is shit, Barry.
You know that.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.888
Well, are you, uh...

24:35.015 --> 24:36.224
doing well otherwise?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.351
Remember that day in the woods?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.606
I've been thinking
about that a lot.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.320
Remember the guy that
took me into the woods?

24:50.363 --> 24:51.948
What was his name?

24:53.158 --> 24:54.784
Like the singer.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.914
Goulet.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.624
Kenneth Goulet.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.753
Yeah.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.963
After he popped the trunk...

25:09.090 --> 25:11.218
and I saw what I saw...

25:12.469 --> 25:15.305
he whispered into my ear.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.644
He said,
"Barry Berkman did this."

25:25.774 --> 25:28.401
I know you killed Janice.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.662
So, you have two choices.

25:40.664 --> 25:44.167
Come with me to the station,
turn yourself in...

25:45.710 --> 25:47.754
or fuckin' die.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.355
Oh.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.401
Mr. Cousineau.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.069
Huh?

26:14.030 --> 26:15.991
I'm sorry.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.708
Barry, you don't
have to do this.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.960
We can get past this.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.089
I know that there
is a world in which

26:31.172 --> 26:33.842
we can get right past this.
Barry, it's me.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.178
It's Mr. Cousineau.
Please. Please, dear God.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.098
I'm not going to
tell anybody. Barry,

26:40.181 --> 26:42.934
I am swearing on
my grandson's life.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.478
I won't tell a soul.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.608
For Christ's sake,
put that fuckin' gun down.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.408
Look, I promise you...

26:58.491 --> 27:01.494
this is water under the bridge.
Whatever you've done,

27:01.578 --> 27:03.330
I forgot it.
I've forgiven you.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.290
I forgive you.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.792
Forgiveness has to be earned.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.045
Then fuckin' earn it!

27:27.771 --> 27:29.939
I know how I can
make it up to you.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.116
I know what I can do.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.454
It could work.

27:44.537 --> 27:47.332
It could work.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.880
Get back in the trunk.
