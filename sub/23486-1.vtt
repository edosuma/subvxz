09:36.158 --> 09:37.952
I know I would.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.453
Why don't you?

09:39.453 --> 09:42.331
Ah, please, I would love to go,but I can't.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.709
- With this whole dating--- 'You would love to go where?'

09:44.792 --> 09:46.961
Oh, Megan's snowboarding trip.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.297
Her cousin canceled,and I can't just..

09:49.297 --> 09:52.466
- Go? Why not?- Oh, I have so much to do.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.594
I have three articles,one due today.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.178
There's no pointgoing on a dating cleanse

09:56.304 --> 09:57.888
if you're gonna hide outin the office.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.850
I mean, it's aboutchallenging yourself.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.395
A ski resortwould be pretty perfect.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.350
(Megan)'I can't believe you're here.'

10:42.433 --> 10:45.186
A girls' trip to Clara Lake justlike when we were in college.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.355
Right, the good old days,when our biggest problem

10:47.396 --> 10:48.939
was choosing a fondue flavor.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.317
[chuckles]Mm, fondue.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.110
Yeah, something tells mewe haven't seen

10:53.194 --> 10:54.945
the last of that fondue bar.

10:55.029 --> 10:55.905
Mm-mm.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.531
[laptop keys clacking]

10:57.531 --> 10:59.033
(Megan)'You've been peckingat that thing'

10:59.075 --> 11:00.117
for the last couple of hours.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.244
Are you actually gettingwork done?

11:02.370 --> 11:04.872
One Dating Cleanse down,two to go.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.540
The first one is called

11:06.666 --> 11:09.418
"From Dating DisasterTo The Dating Cleanse."

11:09.543 --> 11:12.463
- Thank you, Jesse.- That's very mature of you.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.715
Yeah, well, I have to startthinking objectively

11:14.799 --> 11:15.841
if I want to be an editor.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.552
If being an editoris what you really want.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.138
Ugh. I don't knowwhat I want anymore.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.933
Uh, grad schoolis such a question mark

11:23.974 --> 11:27.019
but jumpingfrom writer to editor

11:27.061 --> 11:30.564
just seems likea, a real thing, you know?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.401
Well, maybe this tripwill offer you some perspective.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.903
And maybe gettingsome real writing time

11:36.028 --> 11:37.405
will provide clarity.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.240
You brought your manuscript?

11:39.365 --> 11:40.825
I've to read it againif I want to finish it.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.912
- It's been months.- Cara Reneau, mystery writer.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.330
- Ooh.- Sounds good.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.250
- I like it.- And you know what they say.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.212
You can be anybody you wantto be when you're on vacation.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.089
[gasps]Hey, that's our exit!

11:55.214 --> 11:57.383
(Megan)'Fondue bar, here we come!'

11:57.466 --> 11:59.218
(Cara)'Yes!'

[instrumental music]

12:20.740 --> 12:23.743
[music continues]

12:38.549 --> 12:41.343
(Megan)I can't waitto carve an edge.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.347
[sighs]Hey.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.767
(Megan)'Thank you.'

12:49.185 --> 12:51.353
Hey, so the bad news is

12:51.395 --> 12:53.147
our chalet isn't ready yet

12:53.272 --> 12:55.399
but the good news isthere's still enough daylight

12:55.483 --> 12:57.151
that we can get a few runs in.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.153
Okay, we just haveto rent my board.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.071
- Mm-hmm. Let's do it.- Mm-hmm.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.616
[instrumental music]

13:03.699 --> 13:05.075
- Coat and everything.- Jacket?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.620
- You just nailed it.- Right?

13:08.662 --> 13:09.663
Oh, yeah.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.171
[sighs]Looks like I'm lateto the rental party.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.507
- 'Is that all they have left?'- 'Huh.'

13:19.507 --> 13:20.883
[scoffs]

13:20.925 --> 13:23.344
[instrumental music]

13:23.427 --> 13:24.970
No way. The Cyan 920?

13:25.012 --> 13:28.516
- Is that even in stores yet?- No, it's a custom.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.476
I can't believethey're renting it out.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.019
I'm gonna go getthe lift tickets, you grab

13:32.061 --> 13:33.646
that boardbefore somebody else does.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.980
Mm-hmm.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.732
Ooh, sorry.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.983
Yes.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.987
Well, I seem to have my eyeson the same board as you.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.282
Oh, you seem to havea pretty firm grip on it, too.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.868
Uh, it's yours.

13:47.993 --> 13:51.163
As long as you know it's notthe right board for you.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.665
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.584
The top should fall somewherebetween your nose and you chin

13:55.626 --> 13:57.336
but here it isall the way up

13:57.378 --> 14:00.464
to your...eyes.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.299
Unless you havean advanced rider

14:02.383 --> 14:05.219
who wants to floatat fast speeds over powder.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.806
But I am curious.Why are you so dead-set on it?

14:08.847 --> 14:09.932
I've used this model before.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.060
I guess you could say,I like to know what I'm getting.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.687
Oh, that's pretty cautiousfor somebody

14:14.728 --> 14:16.939
about to go careeningdown a mountain.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.483
- Careening?- Mm, tumbling, falling.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.610
With a boot size like yours..

14:24.738 --> 14:26.198
...you're gonna getsome overhang.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.908
You really wantthat kind of drag?

14:28.033 --> 14:31.829
No, I suppose I don't, Miss..What did you say your name was?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.414
I didn't.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.667
Enjoy the board.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.879
[instrumental music]

15:00.858 --> 15:01.900
[panting]

15:02.026 --> 15:06.113
Oh, my quads were not readyfor those moguls.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.282
Are you sure this one's ours?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.326
It's a little farfrom the lodge.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.535
I know, right?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.412
Almost like whoever picked itwas trying to avoid

15:13.495 --> 15:15.205
their boss' cell phone calls.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.458
[laughing]

15:20.669 --> 15:22.713
- Oh, yeah!- Wow!

15:22.755 --> 15:23.756
This is so nice.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.550
- Nice job.- Oh. Thanks.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.344
- Ooh, snacks.- Mm-hmm.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.512
Now we're talkin'.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.307
It's not addressed to us.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.476
You think they forgot to clean?

15:35.559 --> 15:37.478
Yeah, really.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.812
Wait a second.

15:38.854 --> 15:42.274
This is still cold.Somebody's here.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.777
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:44.818 --> 15:47.237
- What are you doing here?- 'Well, uh..'

15:47.321 --> 15:49.198
Wait. You know each other?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.326
'Okay, there must besome kind of mistake.'

15:52.326 --> 15:55.663
Uh, yes, there is.This man is in our chalet.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
No, no, no.I already checked in.

15:57.164 --> 16:01.210
And as you can see,I rented half a chalet.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.461
Well, that may be the casefor you

16:02.503 --> 16:04.338
but we went through the troubleof booking--

16:04.421 --> 16:05.881
Half a chalet.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.970
- I'm calling the hotel.- This has to be fixed.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.058
Uh, hello, yeah,I'd like to see if I could book

16:16.100 --> 16:18.602
a chalet for two ladies who--

16:18.644 --> 16:20.521
Oh, you have nothing?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.898
You know,it doesn't have to be a chalet.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.942
It could be a hotel

16:24.984 --> 16:27.653
a cabin, broom closet.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.907
Nothing? Thanks for checking.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.371
Well, I was planningon opening this tomorrow

16:37.496 --> 16:39.206
'but maybe we shouldcrack it open now'

16:39.289 --> 16:40.708
'and get to know one another.'

16:40.833 --> 16:43.836
- Would you like a glass, Mr..- Just Ben.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.879
I'm not muchof a fancy wine guy, but, sure.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.006
I'll give it a shot.But my buddy will be stoked.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.092
- He loves a good Cabernet.- Wait. Buddy?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.511
There's more than one of you?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.889
Hey, Ben, uh,how about a heads up

16:55.973 --> 16:57.850
next timewe're gonna have guests.

16:59.476 --> 17:02.813
Yeah, slight issuewith the fine print.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.898
Look, these ladiesare gonna be in the other room.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.777
Hey, look, you know what?It's gonna be fine.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.655
I called the lodge, butthe resort's fully booked up.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.742
- I sort of--- Messed up.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.411
It's all good.The more, the merrier.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.454
I mean, it's a huge bummer

17:19.579 --> 17:22.165
consideringour guys' weekend and all.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.501
Cool!

17:24.585 --> 17:27.296
- Is that Cabernet?- It sure is.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.797
- You want a glass?- 'Sure.'

17:28.922 --> 17:31.091
- I'm Megan, by the way.- Sean.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.801
- Cara.- Thanks.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.220
I don't know about you guys,but wine just doesn't

17:35.304 --> 17:36.805
taste right without chocolate.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.600
Ooh, I'll take one. Thank you.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.145
Really good. Let's seewhat you guys got here.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.397
Mm, artisanal brie

17:45.481 --> 17:47.608
'Royal Fig Jelly..'

17:47.608 --> 17:50.235
Champagne? You guysmust be VIPs around here.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.487
[Megan chuckles]

17:51.612 --> 17:53.989
Ooh, these are cute.Wine charms.

17:54.114 --> 17:57.493
- Oh, not the wine charms.- What's wrong with wine charms?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.203
How else would we knowwhose wine is whose?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.455
(Ben)Hm, makes you wonder how peoplekept track of their wine

18:01.455 --> 18:03.999
for thousands of yearsbefore they were around.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.754
Okay.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.299
There is a really nice deckout front. Maybe we should..

18:12.299 --> 18:15.219
Yes, let's justtake this party outside.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.637
What, outside? We just got warm.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.306
I mean, that's whatthe firepit's for.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.941
Wine charm?

18:36.740 --> 18:39.910
- Thanks.- Mm, enjoy.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.705
- Uh..- 'Don't give up, Ben.'

18:43.831 --> 18:46.083
I'm sensing you're on your wayto a solid B-plus fire.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.418
Thanks, man. Not much you can dowith wet wood.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.796
But, hey, if you wanna goand get some dryer logs..

18:50.838 --> 18:52.172
Nah, you got this.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.175
Besides, this weekend,I'm avoiding doing anything

18:55.259 --> 18:56.510
that could be considered work.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.887
I'm not talking about work,I'm not working out

18:58.929 --> 19:01.932
I'm not even gonna work iton the dance floor, you know?

19:02.015 --> 19:03.517
If you knewhow many variations of that

19:03.642 --> 19:05.686
I heard on the way up,you wouldn't be laughing either.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.187
Well, I'm downwith the sentiment.

19:07.271 --> 19:11.525
In fact, we should make a pact.No work talk. Period.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.652
'I don't even wanna knowwhat you guys do.'

19:13.735 --> 19:15.904
- Right on.- On that note..

19:15.946 --> 19:18.949
I'm gonna power this thing down,lock it in the glove box.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.953
I am so therewith you...in spirit.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.205
Hey, uh, where's Cara?

19:25.372 --> 19:28.000
She got caught upin that word we can't mention

19:28.083 --> 19:29.877
'but we should take pityon her.'

19:29.918 --> 19:32.212
She got slammed this weekend.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.214
Yes. Alright.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.050
[clattering]

19:37.718 --> 19:39.303
[laughing]

19:39.386 --> 19:41.722
- 'Oh, sorry, man.'- Come on!

19:41.847 --> 19:44.516
[Megan laughing]

19:44.558 --> 19:46.393
I guess I'll go findsome more matches.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.728
Unless, of course,you'd like to.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.980
No, no, no, man.Go to town, okay?

19:50.063 --> 19:52.566
There are probably somein the, uh, kitchen.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.694
- Oh, good idea. Thanks.- 'Yeah.'

19:55.736 --> 19:58.405
Like I was saying,vacation is all about

19:58.488 --> 19:59.448
staying off the grid.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.074
- Mm.- Yeah.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.418
You know, there's some instantlight logs in the closet.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.337
You have very little faithin me.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.838
I've known youfor all of five minutes.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.840
- How much faith should I have?- Hey.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.092
I gave you my snowboard.That has to be worth something.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.720
- Your snowboard?- Ah, f-figure of speech.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.390
- Mm.- But I gotta hand it to you.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.184
You got a great eye.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.686
See this mark?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.897
It means only 40 of thesewere ever made.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.816
Which meansonly 39 are left in the world.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.611
Which means you lucked out.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.112
Funny you didn't mention thatin the pro-shop.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.989
I didn't want to add fuelto the fire.

20:41.114 --> 20:41.949
What fire?

20:42.115 --> 20:43.617
You seemed pretty dead-seton getting it.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.119
You should see meat a sample sale.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.330
You know what?You look really familiar.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.290
What part of Seattledo you work in?

20:50.374 --> 20:52.417
(Sean)'Hey, hey,you missed out on our pact.'

20:52.501 --> 20:53.961
This is a work-free zone.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.546
- No work talk.- Won't argue with that.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.924
Then shut your laptopand come join us.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.593
It's leisure time.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.846
Why does no one understandthis is leisure?

21:04.972 --> 21:08.308
Hm, lots of words,super close together.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.726
[inhales]Looks like work.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.353
Look closer, it's a novel.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.648
If you're a novelist workingon a novel, it's still work.

21:14.648 --> 21:18.235
Unless I'm a novelistwho's avoiding her real work

21:18.318 --> 21:19.486
which I have to work on later.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.904
You realize just how many times

21:20.946 --> 21:23.156
you said the word "work?"

21:23.240 --> 21:25.492
I'm sorry, I'm not used to wordsbeing off limits.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.453
It kind of makes it hard to getto know each other, doesn't it?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.288
[laptop keys clacking]

21:30.330 --> 21:32.833
Well, getting to know youis overrated.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.918
People give you signsthat tell you who they are.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.380
Like, you know,typing when someone's talking.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.758
Mm.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.224
Robes, check. Towels, check.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.769
It is timefor some R and R. Ca..

21:52.853 --> 21:54.855
- Have you started a diary?- Nope.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.025
That thing you said about beinganyone you wanna be on vacation

21:58.150 --> 22:00.736
if I'm even consideringbeing a mystery writer

22:00.861 --> 22:02.821
then I've gotto start taking notes

22:02.863 --> 22:06.116
treat the whole worldlike one big mystery.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.201
Like that couple over there.

22:08.326 --> 22:10.829
They haven't talkedfor five whole minutes.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.456
What's the story there?

22:13.498 --> 22:15.042
Maybe..

22:15.125 --> 22:18.128
Maybe they're tired from skiing.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.590
Well, what about Ben and Sean's$500 gift basket?

22:21.631 --> 22:22.883
Oh, well, actually, detective

22:22.883 --> 22:24.593
I have been doingsome of my own digging

22:24.634 --> 22:26.595
and there is a story there.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.513
Turns out..

22:28.597 --> 22:30.932
...the hotel sent it to them.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.103
Come on, let's go. Spa time.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.563
Ooh, spa time.

22:36.646 --> 22:37.939
[both giggling]

22:37.981 --> 22:41.068
[sighing]Here it goes.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.780
My last moments of relaxationfor the evening.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.239
What do you mean?

22:46.239 --> 22:48.700
Wi-Fi caught up with mein the locker room.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.535
What, did Diane ask youto do something?

22:50.619 --> 22:52.245
Yeah, but it's nothing.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.830
There's a new positionin the office

22:53.914 --> 22:55.832
and she wants meto post a job description.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.000
But you're on vacation.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.376
Yeah, but I can do itin my sleep.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.295
In fact, watch,I'll do it right now.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.838
[breathing heavily]

23:01.922 --> 23:04.383
Operations managerwanted for women's magazine.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.343
Must work wellwith colorful personalities.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.969
Mm, that's a nice wayof putting it.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.472
Have organized work habitsand in-depth knowledge

23:10.514 --> 23:13.266
of our business needs. Send.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.726
You know,that sounds like somebody

23:14.810 --> 23:15.936
who already works there.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.063
- What, me?- Mm-hmm.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.648
'Come on,Diane's looking for someone'

23:19.689 --> 23:20.941
with management experience.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.401
I'm just her assistant.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.985
Exactly. You manage Diane.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.445
[chuckles]I manage her salads.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.324
And her editorial schedules,photo shoots, interviews.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.538
Huh. I never really looked at itthat way.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.625
You know, in all honesty,I've never really looked at it..

23:38.708 --> 23:40.043
...at all.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.296
I'm so focused on Diane, my ownstuff slips through the cracks.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.799
That's not true.I mean, you planned this trip.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.592
Yeah, look how wellthat's going.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.885
Oh, who cares about the chalet?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.637
We can still haveour girls' trip.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.348
- Mm.- Really. Wha..

23:53.473 --> 23:55.976
Look, I'm just gonnatake a deep breath

23:56.059 --> 23:59.479
mind my own business and pretendthose guys aren't even there.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.480
Fair enough.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.024
[both exhaling sharply]

24:05.443 --> 24:07.988
Why didn't the hotel give usour own gift basket?

24:08.071 --> 24:11.491
[exhales sharply]Zen-ing out over here, Cara.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.160
Zen-ing out.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.711
- It felt so good.- It felt good, right?

24:22.836 --> 24:24.296
Shh.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.882
Are you really shushing usat 9 p.m.?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.426
[whispering]Yeah, he had a rough dayof not working.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.428
- He needs his beauty sleep.- Yeah.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.014
That's why there's these thingscalled bedrooms.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.348
The chair is much more comfy.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.851
Plus, I got the blanket,I got my cocoa

24:37.976 --> 24:39.644
I got my Agatha Christie.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.937
"And Then There Were None."

24:41.021 --> 24:42.439
Yeah.I found it on the bookshelf.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.317
I got 50 pages left,but I've narrowed it down

24:45.400 --> 24:48.153
to either Veraor Judge Wargrave.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.573
- Don't ruin it.- Oh, I would never.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.867
Although, I would sayboth of your guesses are wrong.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.410
Not hearing you.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.872
I am curious why you twoaren't down at karaoke.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.415
It's ladies' night.

25:01.541 --> 25:05.295
Which begs a question.Why aren't you there?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.048
Well, sort of taking a breakfrom that whole world.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.635
- From the karaoke world?- No, from the dating world.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.261
I guess you can call ita cleanse.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.513
Hey, if it works for you,more power to you.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.307
Yeah, actually,it is working for me.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.352
It's helping me focuson more important things like..

25:23.980 --> 25:25.982
Are you expecting someone?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.151
Maybe.

25:35.742 --> 25:36.910
Hey, man, thanks.That's awesome.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.828
(male #1)'Mm-hmm.'

25:38.870 --> 25:40.288
[door closes]

25:41.414 --> 25:43.208
You know, when I saidthere were only 39 of these

25:43.291 --> 25:44.542
'left in the world?'

25:45.794 --> 25:47.754
Now there's only 37.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.137
[instrumental music]

26:03.603 --> 26:06.648
[machine whirring]

26:24.165 --> 26:25.250
- Do you hear that?- What?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.168
It's the first chairliftof the day.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.712
Let's get out there.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.297
I'm surprisedyou have so much energy.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.299
- Weren't you working all night?- Good thing I was.

26:32.382 --> 26:35.051
'Cause I finishedmy second Dating Cleanse post

26:35.135 --> 26:36.886
and ten pages of my novel.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.348
Mm, look at you. It must bethe fresh mountain air.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.225
Well, Diane sent meanother headline.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.477
- What was it?- "Cleanse Complications.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.147
How To Say NoTo Toxic Temptations."

26:47.230 --> 26:48.732
- Temptation?- Yeah, well..

26:48.773 --> 26:49.816
It was all hypothetical.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.985
Not exactlytemptation mountain up here.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.486
- Oh, except for these.- Mm-hmm.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.323
I'm so looking forwardto the fresh mountain powder.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.074
It snowed, like, nine incheslast night.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.326
Ah, and not a soulhas touched it.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.995
We'll be the first twoout there.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.332
[instrumental music]

27:08.335 --> 27:11.713
- Well, maybe not the first two.- Hm.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.176
[sighing]Hm.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.523
Uh, excuse me.How did he get up there?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.400
- The lifts just started.- That guy?

27:32.442 --> 27:35.153
Someone took him up therein the snow-grooming machine.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.158
Now do you agreethere's something up

27:40.241 --> 27:41.493
with our chalet-mates?

27:41.534 --> 27:45.163
Yeah. I thinkhe slipped the groomer a 20.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.916
Okay, fine,but what about the mysterious

27:47.957 --> 27:50.043
late-night snowboard delivery?

27:50.168 --> 27:51.044
- Mm.- Mm-hmm.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.171
Maybe he's an online shopper.

27:53.254 --> 27:55.215
Come on, let's get to the summit

27:55.215 --> 27:57.342
before you getthe server backstory.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.135
It all began with a Danish.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.887
[laughing]

28:05.392 --> 28:07.644
Dude, you should'vecome with me, man.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.979
How often do you get to be thefirst person on the mountain?

28:10.063 --> 28:11.481
About as oftenas I get to sleep in.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.149
- It's 8 a.m.- Dude.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.402
8 a.m. is, like, noonfor a surgeon.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.404
Okay,time for latte number two.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.571
I'm gonna geta couple of runs in

28:18.613 --> 28:20.365
and, uh, don't forgetour spa thing later.

28:20.448 --> 28:23.785
I take my vacation timevery seriously.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.412
Oh, before I forget

28:25.412 --> 28:28.331
she came by the chalet earlierlooking for you.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.126
Mr. Livingston.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.044
It's so greatto finally meet you in person.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.796
Please. Ben.You must be Jennifer.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.339
We are so gratefulfor everything

28:36.423 --> 28:37.757

28:37.757 --> 28:39.592
I just wanted to ask youabout the benefit tonight.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.261
Would you prefer to makeyour speech before or--

28:41.344 --> 28:43.930
I'm sorry, speech?Uh, there must be some mistake.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.098
I'm donating to the event.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.434
- I'm-I'm not attending.- Are you sure?

28:47.517 --> 28:49.769
There's gonna be a dance tonightand the caterers--

28:49.853 --> 28:51.271
No, I'm sure it's fantastic

28:51.271 --> 28:54.274
but I gotta stayout of the public eye right now.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.776
- So, did the boards arrive?- Yes.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.404
The driver hit some traffic,but he should be here soon.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.072
Okay, well,can you just do me a favor

29:01.156 --> 29:02.782
and shoot me a textwhen they do?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.951
Sure.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.327
Well, at leastwe'll get to the top

29:06.369 --> 29:07.996
before the crowd gets..

29:08.037 --> 29:10.331
[instrumental music]

29:11.249 --> 29:14.419
And the plot thickens.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.338
(Megan)'Maybe he's offering hera ride on the groomer.'

29:18.214 --> 29:19.799
Ah..

29:19.924 --> 29:20.925
Come on.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.571
(Megan)So, what's the plan?Board, fondue, hot tub?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.657
As long as fondue'son the docket, I'm happy.

29:44.782 --> 29:46.743
Hey, do you think I canget some writing time in?

29:46.785 --> 29:47.869
Yeah, be my guest.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.829
The more you work on your novel,the more likely it is

29:49.913 --> 29:50.997
you'll say yes for grad school.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.332
Uh, don't get ahead of yourself.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.625
[cell phone ringing]

29:53.666 --> 29:54.792
Oh.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.297
[sighs]

30:00.298 --> 30:02.383
Hi, Diane.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.344
No, it's never too earlyto call.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.513
Listen, that job postingyou put up..

30:06.513 --> 30:08.348
- 'Is it okay?'- Better than okay.

30:08.431 --> 30:09.641
We got eight applicants already

30:09.682 --> 30:12.810
but we're in such a rushand so overwhelmed.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.395
Could you possibly screen them?

30:14.521 --> 30:16.189
Uh, you mean, like,go over their resumes?

30:16.272 --> 30:18.316
(Diane on phone)'No, their resumesall look the same to me.'

30:18.399 --> 30:19.776
I need you to screen themon the phone

30:19.859 --> 30:21.027
narrow them down to three.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.237
You saw my schedule next week.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.279
'I can't possibly meet'

30:23.363 --> 30:25.031
'with eight people myself.'

30:25.073 --> 30:26.783
But you don't mean,like, today, right?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.660
Don't worry. One of the internsscheduled the calls already.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.370
Actually, I better get off,the first one's gonna be

30:30.495 --> 30:32.288

30:32.330 --> 30:34.457
- What? But..- Megan.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.543
What would I do without you?

30:38.378 --> 30:40.547
Ha! I can't believe this.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.382
She wants meto screen the candidates today.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.550
- Like, right now.- Oh.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.176
You can't let herruin your weekend.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.970
Well, I'm not gonnalet her ruin yours.

30:47.053 --> 30:50.390
Why don't you head on to the topand I'll meet up with you later?

30:54.727 --> 30:55.937
[Cara sighs]

30:57.480 --> 30:59.941
[cell phone ringing]

31:01.568 --> 31:05.363
Hi, thanks so muchfor doing this on the weekend.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.283

31:08.324 --> 31:11.619
[instrumental music]

31:31.681 --> 31:32.974
[sighs]

31:35.518 --> 31:37.770
Good morning. You're up early.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.856
I was hoping to getthe first run-in of the day

31:39.897 --> 31:42.108
but some guy beat me to it.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.359
Ah, you know what they say.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.111
All's fairin love and snowboarding.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.030
I don't think they say that.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.952
Look, I kinda feel likewe got off on the wrong foot.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.662
Did we?

31:54.787 --> 31:56.581
I was hopingfor a weekend with my buddy

31:56.623 --> 31:59.000
maybe get somesolitary reflection time in.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.668
Mm, I know the feeling.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.671
(Ben)What I'm trying to say is,what if we just start fresh?

32:03.713 --> 32:07.258
Like, what if we just metright here in this chairlift?

32:07.300 --> 32:11.554
Oh, what, like a properintroduction? No signs?

32:11.596 --> 32:14.307
[chuckles]You may mock meabout the whole sign thing

32:14.432 --> 32:15.850
but it's a 100% foolproof.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.394
For example, last night,with the wine charms

32:18.436 --> 32:21.564
you chose the pineapple,the least friendly fruit.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.650
Least friendly or best defended?

32:23.691 --> 32:26.152
Best defendedor overly defensive?

32:26.277 --> 32:27.862
I find that peoplehave all sorts of defenses.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.323
- Like, deflection.- Deflection?

32:30.448 --> 32:31.866
Are you implyingI have something to hide?

32:31.991 --> 32:34.118
Well, if we're goingon your wine-charm theory

32:34.160 --> 32:36.496
I'd say you do.You chose the sunglasses.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.707
The classic disguise.What could that mean?

32:45.880 --> 32:48.132
- Trees or moguls?- Why do you ask?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.593
Honestly,so I can do the opposite.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.538

[door opens]

34:13.259 --> 34:15.553
(Cara)Came back early to read, did ya?

34:16.219 --> 34:17.804
[sighs]

34:19.098 --> 34:21.434
- A little static over there?- Yeah.

34:21.516 --> 34:23.268
Under control. Thanks.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.772
Uh, saw some hair bandsin the bathroom.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.690
Yeah, they'd be great

34:27.774 --> 34:29.984
if only there was a helmetthat fit over them.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.821
'Did you finish reading?You still think it's Vera?'

34:33.946 --> 34:36.364
Yeah, actually,I moved on to another book.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.284
Wait. You read my manuscript?

34:38.326 --> 34:40.536
Uh..It was open on the coffee table.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.414
- You had no right to read this.- But I couldn't put it down.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.833
I had to get to the end.It's really good.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.464
Well, it's just somethingI threw together.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.382
I actually came backto work on it

34:53.466 --> 34:55.842
get somesolitary reflection time in.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.805
I get it. Dying to read more.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.765
You know what,you seem a little too content

35:00.848 --> 35:02.767
to be inside,reading all the time.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.978
Okay, let's just say I haven'tbeen super social lately.

35:06.103 --> 35:09.649
Just laying low,no crazy nights out.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.442
Something's not adding up.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.486
You really are a mystery writer.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.196
Mm, you claim to be laying low

35:15.238 --> 35:17.907
but...it's not what I'm seeing.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.953
Okay, what I'm seeing is you'rebeing a little overly curious.

35:22.829 --> 35:26.249
I'm telling you, sunglasses.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.062
And you graduatedfrom Portland State?

35:49.939 --> 35:50.815
Oh.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.776
That's a year after me. Cool.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.614
Huh, I havethe same major as you.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.201
Well, that's great. I, um..

36:02.326 --> 36:04.412
We're gonna be setting upin-person interviews

36:04.453 --> 36:07.206
for next week...and..

36:07.290 --> 36:11.168
You know what? I will send youall the details in an email.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.713
Okay, thanks. Bye.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.632
[sighs]How am I supposedto sound authoritative

36:16.716 --> 36:18.050
when the next timeI see the candidates

36:18.175 --> 36:20.428
I'll be offering themtheir choice of tea or coffee?

36:20.553 --> 36:22.680
I mean,what exactly am I doing here?

36:22.722 --> 36:24.140
Management?

36:24.181 --> 36:28.644
[sighs]Well, then why am I not upfor the job?

36:28.686 --> 36:30.771
Because they asked for it.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.568
[cell phone ringing]

36:35.693 --> 36:37.403
Oh, another one.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.740
'Hi, thanks so much.'

36:40.865 --> 36:44.076
[instrumental music]

37:12.939 --> 37:16.192
Wait. I walk out,so you walk in?

37:16.275 --> 37:18.319
Must be one of your signs.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.364
You sure you don't wantany help?

37:21.447 --> 37:23.574
The menu in therecan get pretty complicated.

37:23.658 --> 37:24.825
Mm, it's called Beer & Brats.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.328
I think I can handle iton my own.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.622
Well, sure,anyone can order a brat

37:29.747 --> 37:33.751
but garnishing it,that takes serious know-how.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.471
Great, so the interviewwill be 9:30 a.m.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.765
at Mallory Magazine.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.685
Yeah. Great. See you then.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.980
Ah, finally, last one.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.732
[screams]

37:56.816 --> 37:58.317
[groans]

37:58.442 --> 38:00.486
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.115
- Megan.- Sean.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.992
[groans]

38:06.075 --> 38:08.411
- Are you okay?- I'm okay.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.497
But I think there'ssomething wrong with my wrist.

38:11.497 --> 38:12.748
[sighs]

38:13.165 --> 38:14.333
Mm.

38:15.918 --> 38:16.919
Okay, maybe you were right.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.672
That wasa perfectly-dressed brat.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.340
- But, phew.- But?

38:21.465 --> 38:24.427
Somebody's gonna have to take medown the mountain in a sled.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.678
[laughing]

38:25.678 --> 38:28.222
Yeah, I know that condiment barpretty well.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.349
My brother and I usedto have topping contests

38:30.433 --> 38:31.392
there when I was a kid.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.435
I'm guessing you won?

38:32.518 --> 38:33.686
We'd usually get chased out

38:33.728 --> 38:35.396
before a winnercould be declared.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.440
I actually wasn't sureI'd be allowed back into there.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.775
[laughing]

38:42.361 --> 38:45.781
But...being up hereon a day like today..

38:45.823 --> 38:48.284
...just makes me wish everyonecould have this, you know?

38:48.367 --> 38:52.788
It makes you feel like thingscould be just...perfect again.

38:54.373 --> 38:57.293
Today was pretty perfect.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.669
That's why I was wondering

38:58.711 --> 39:02.715
why you were holed up readingmost of the day.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.425
Oh, it's this new authorI found.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.135
She's becomingone of my favorites.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.971
[chuckling]

39:10.264 --> 39:12.099
'Besides, I need a little restbefore I take on'

39:12.141 --> 39:13.893
'the pipe where it all started.'

39:13.976 --> 39:15.186
Where it all started?

39:15.269 --> 39:16.854
Yeah,I learned to snowboard up here.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.775
I landed my first 360on that pipe...when I was nine.

39:20.816 --> 39:23.402
I thought no one was watching.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.029
And then I just hear clapping.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.782
I turn around, and my dad'sstanding there watching.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.075
All the older kidswere laughing.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.576
I thought I was gonna die.

39:30.659 --> 39:32.369
[laughing]

39:32.411 --> 39:35.539
Well, I know the feeling.My dad's a huge clapper, too.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.209
Restaurants, birthdays,you name it.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.003
He still thinks he's onthe sidelines at my soccer game.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.214
I thinkmy dad would've liked him.

39:43.255 --> 39:46.509
- Oh, I'm sorry, I--- No, no, it's okay.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.554
[sighs]Being up here,I can almost hear it.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.016
This place, this sport

39:54.058 --> 39:56.227
it was his passion.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.772
We used to havethe best weekends up here.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.400
And I haven't hadthat kind of fun in a long time.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.362
The weekend's not over yet.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.241
[cell phone ringing]

40:11.784 --> 40:14.453
[sighs]

40:14.453 --> 40:15.871
Day job?

40:17.039 --> 40:19.291
Won't leave me alone.

40:19.416 --> 40:22.795
Might not matter soon. I've beenaccepted to grad school.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.839
- Congratulations.- Well, thank you.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.133
But it doesn't mean I'm going.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.845
Yeah. This year,I'm trying to be more cautious.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.348
You know, think things through,evaluate risk.

40:34.473 --> 40:37.143
I mean, don't get me wrong,my job is no picnic.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.146
Insane deadlines,phone calls all weekend

40:40.187 --> 40:43.065
but I don't know,it's one of these jobs

40:43.149 --> 40:45.651
that most people would kill for.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.361
Yeah, I kinda haveone of those, too.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.906
Okay, so you know, it's notthat easy to walk away from.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.869
Wait. What, what's so greatabout your job?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.745
Uh, I workfor a snowboarding company.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.456
- Ah, right.- Uh-huh.

40:59.498 --> 41:02.501
- It's all making sense now.- Mm-hmm.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.837
Well, that should be fun.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.964
In theory.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.425
You know what you said earlierabout your helmet?

41:11.343 --> 41:14.722
It'd be easy enough to puta groove here for a ponytail.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.932
Oh, did I give youa business idea?

41:17.016 --> 41:18.517
[laughs]

41:18.601 --> 41:22.354
It's the kind of thing we usedto jump on, but not anymore.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.191
Innovation's takena back seat to image.

41:25.232 --> 41:28.194
Still, it can't hurtto pitch it to them.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.362
You know, for someone who'sso cautious with her own life

41:30.362 --> 41:32.948
you dole outa lot of risky advice.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.742
I guess you like to livevicariously.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.869
You do realizewe just agreed on something?

41:36.911 --> 41:39.496
[laughing]I'll let it slide this time

41:39.580 --> 41:42.541
but don't let it happen again.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.918
[laughing]

41:43.959 --> 41:46.253
[cell phone buzzing]

41:49.173 --> 41:53.719
Ah, shoot! I forgotI gotta be somewhere, so I'm..

41:53.802 --> 41:55.638
- I'll catch you later.- Yeah.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.568
You sure you don't minddoing this?

42:09.568 --> 42:11.445
I know you came hereto get away from work.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.280
After I mowed you down,the least I could do

42:13.405 --> 42:15.616
is save youa trip to the hospital.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.117
Plus..

42:18.077 --> 42:20.538
...I wasn't gonna leave youwith that EMT.

42:20.621 --> 42:24.583
[chuckles]You know, I got nervous whenhe opened that X-ray manual.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.752
[laughing]

42:26.794 --> 42:29.922
- How does this feel?- Ah, tight.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.382
It's only gonna get worseif it swells

42:31.465 --> 42:35.010
so, uh, keep it elevated,and no devices.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.137
Wait, no. No, no, no.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.514
I got a call in ten minutes. I..

42:38.556 --> 42:41.517
No, I-I don't thinkyou understood what I just said.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.935
No devices.

42:43.018 --> 42:46.188
No typing,no texting, no calling.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.148
- For how long?- Two to three days.

42:48.274 --> 42:51.026
- Hah. No. No, that can't work.- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.946
No. No, no, that can't work.You don't know my boss.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.657
I can't tell her that.She'll never listen to me.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.662
But maybeshe'll listen to a doctor.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.294
Hi, Diane,I meant to text you back

43:08.335 --> 43:11.088
but my mittenskept getting in the way.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.634
It's a littlesnowboarding humor.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.303
(Diane on phone)'Don't get too distracted,Cara.'

43:17.428 --> 43:19.179
You know, there's a lotof eyeballs on this third post.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.348
It needs to bea real showstopper, right?

43:21.473 --> 43:23.142
Yeah, sure,maybe something about

43:23.267 --> 43:26.145
how much you can get donewhile you're not dating.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.439
I meant somethingpeople would wanna read.

43:28.480 --> 43:31.859
Um, tell you what,I'll work on some headlines..

43:31.984 --> 43:33.736
- 'Um, okay.'- Well, have fun.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.030
(Diane)'But, remember, I needthat third post by midnight.'

43:36.155 --> 43:38.741
- 'Don't be late.'- You got it.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.788
Huh.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.584
Hey, if you're looking foryour friend, she's downstairs.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.878
- Who, my friend?- Yeah, petite, dark hair.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.880
- Purple jacket.- Oh, you mean Megan?

43:53.005 --> 43:54.840
Yeah, yeah.She's in the infirmary.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.300
- Wha..- 'It's all good.'

43:56.383 --> 43:57.801
She banged upher wrist or something.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.678
Oh, no. Uh..

43:59.762 --> 44:02.389
- It's this way? Thank you.- Yeah, right down there.

44:03.766 --> 44:07.770
- You got a visitor.- Hey. Hey, are you okay?

44:07.811 --> 44:09.480
Could be worse.

44:09.563 --> 44:12.066
It's just a minor fractureand a sprain.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.151
She'll recover a lot fasterwithout this.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.154
- You sprain your wrist?- Might even save her weekend.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.865
Hey, my phone!

44:19.948 --> 44:21.075
How are you feeling?

44:21.200 --> 44:24.286
Well, other than this,I'm hungry.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.503
Ben, you've reallyoutdone yourself.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.838
I was expectingfive or six boards

44:34.922 --> 44:37.132
not fifteen of them.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.926
Signed by Travis Bretz?

44:39.051 --> 44:40.677
Yeah, well, you can thank Travisfor that one.

44:40.761 --> 44:43.764
He couldn't have signed themif you hadn't donated them.

44:46.892 --> 44:49.061
Giving every kidthe chance to go to camp

44:49.061 --> 44:50.229
no matterhow little they come from

44:50.270 --> 44:52.856
well, that's reallyimportant to me.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.566
Well, if all goes well tonight

44:54.608 --> 44:57.277
even more kidswill be able to attend.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.739
It's a good guest list.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.158
I can't help but thinkif these people saw

45:03.200 --> 45:04.993
your level of involvement

45:05.077 --> 45:07.121
they may follow your lead.

45:07.246 --> 45:10.082
Look, any other timeI would be front and center

45:10.165 --> 45:11.417
but I-I mean, I just can't do

45:11.458 --> 45:13.419
any public appearancesright now.

45:13.544 --> 45:16.755
Okay, but there's not gonna beany press tonight

45:16.880 --> 45:20.884
just my own photographer.It's gonna be really low key.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.972
It's just so rare

45:25.097 --> 45:27.141
that one nightof somebody's time

45:27.266 --> 45:30.853
can mean so muchto so many kids.

45:36.650 --> 45:39.153
(Megan)'I got to hear someone say noto Diane today.'

45:39.194 --> 45:40.487
[gasps]Sean actually called?

45:40.612 --> 45:42.197
Mm-hmm.You should've been there.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.740
He was all doctorly, like

45:43.782 --> 45:46.869
"No devices for the next48 hours. Doctor's orders."

45:46.910 --> 45:47.870
[laughing]

45:47.911 --> 45:49.121
So good. I wish I was there.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.415
Oh. What did youget up to today?

45:51.457 --> 45:55.753
Oh, you know, boarding,riding, more boarding.

45:55.836 --> 45:56.962
I talked to Diane

45:57.045 --> 46:00.841
and, uh...I had lunch with Ben.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.220
Like, a lunch lunch? Huh.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.848
What'd you guys talk about?

46:07.890 --> 46:11.101
Nothing heavy. I guess he worksat a snowboarding company.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.478
- Mm-hmm.- And..

46:12.603 --> 46:15.814
- We talked about my manuscript.- What?

46:15.898 --> 46:17.065
Yeah, I accidentally left it out

46:17.149 --> 46:20.194
and I guess he sort of read it.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.613
You don't show your writingto anybody.

46:22.654 --> 46:25.240
Now you're telling me he skippedout on snowboarding today

46:25.282 --> 46:26.408
to read your manuscript?

46:26.492 --> 46:29.328
He's a big reader. I don't know.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.371
Oh, and then, before that,we got stuck together

46:31.413 --> 46:33.499
'on a chairlift.'

46:33.582 --> 46:35.876
What? I was trying to avoid him.

46:39.671 --> 46:41.840
Guess you didn't seethe sauna rules.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.800
Number one, no brooding.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.385
[sighs]

46:48.096 --> 46:49.348
Look, it's just thischarity thing tonight.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.682
I feel like I should go.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.893
I thought you weren't doingany public events.

46:53.018 --> 46:54.645
Yeah, I know.

46:54.686 --> 46:58.398
The woman running it,she was very convincing.

46:58.524 --> 46:59.983
And she saidshe could put me at the back.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.903
No media, no name tags.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.030
Then go. No biggie.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.323
I'll be right there at the bar

47:06.406 --> 47:07.783
winning the trivia contestwithout you.

47:07.824 --> 47:10.494
Yeah, but see, that'sthe thing. It's our last night.

47:10.577 --> 47:13.038
I feel like I should be hangingwith the group, you know?

47:14.039 --> 47:15.707
The group?

47:15.749 --> 47:17.835
And, uh,which members of the group

47:17.876 --> 47:20.754
do you anticipate missing?'Cause I know it isn't me.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.590
'Cara?'

47:26.552 --> 47:28.011
Did she say something about me?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.221
No, but I'm sensing

47:29.304 --> 47:30.222
she dislikes you less

47:30.347 --> 47:31.890
than she did yesterday.

47:32.849 --> 47:35.352
Meg, you know thatI am on the dating cleanse.

47:35.394 --> 47:39.189
And even if I wasn't,Ben is not good dating material.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.316
He's got way too much going onbehind the scenes.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.944
He's got secret meetings

47:43.986 --> 47:46.280
and snowboard deliveries.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.782
I like to write mysteries,not live them.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.951
And after everythingthat happened on New Year's

47:50.993 --> 47:53.871
I just, I wanna be cautious.

47:53.912 --> 47:55.372
Hm, fair enough.

47:55.414 --> 47:58.667
Just...don't be too quickto judge him.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.712
He'll show you who he isin his own time.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.549
Tell me this.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.051
What would happenif you told her the truth?

48:09.761 --> 48:11.930
You mean,if I told her who I am?

48:12.931 --> 48:14.933
Yeah, but then,she's just one mouse click away

48:15.058 --> 48:16.810
from reading that story.

48:18.604 --> 48:20.606
Well, I'm guessingyou're pretty beat

48:20.689 --> 48:23.066
so you wannajust rest up tonight?

48:23.150 --> 48:24.359
No, tonight is our last night

48:24.443 --> 48:27.279
and rumor has it thatthere's this trivia contest.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.699
And Sean asked meto enter with him.

48:30.782 --> 48:33.785
- Oh, cute.- You wanna come?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.579
Ah, no,I don't wanna be a third wheel.

48:35.662 --> 48:37.289
You could be the fourth wheel.

48:37.372 --> 48:38.790
Why don't you ask Ben to join?

48:38.790 --> 48:41.418
That might conflictwith dating cleanse.

48:41.501 --> 48:43.462
It's not a date, it's trivia.

48:43.503 --> 48:45.213
No, I, I meant writing it.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.424
I still owe Diane one more post.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.384
I was hopingto hike back up to the chalet

48:49.426 --> 48:52.304
and get one last gulpof fresh air before I start.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.765

49:04.608 --> 49:06.443
Yeah, I'm gonna hike back upto the chalet.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.028
I have some work to finish.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.196
So you're staying in tonight?

49:09.321 --> 49:10.364
Um, I don't know.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.990
Actually,M-Megan mentioned something

49:12.115 --> 49:13.325
about a trivia contest.

49:13.325 --> 49:15.369
I'm not sureif that's your speed, but if--

49:15.494 --> 49:17.079
Uh, what time?

49:17.120 --> 49:18.664
Like, eight-ish.

49:18.747 --> 49:19.998
8:00? Um..

49:20.123 --> 49:23.210
You know, I-I sort of committedto something at 8:00

49:23.251 --> 49:24.753
which I should probablyfocus on..

49:24.836 --> 49:27.506
Will you, will you just give meone minute?

49:27.506 --> 49:31.426

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:57.995
Look...my publicist,he said it's probably best

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.163
if I head back tonight.

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:00.331
Do what you've gotta do.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:03.042
I'll get a ride back,figure something out.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:04.835
Are you sure you don't wannatalk this over with Cara?

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:06.295
I mean,maybe there's an explanation.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:07.588
No, no.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.340
I gotta take thisfor what it is.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:11.008
It's a sign.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.678
It's a sign that thiswasn't meant to work out.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.598
See you in Seattle.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.810
Cara, you don't have to bethe victim in all this.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:22.853
What are you talking about?

01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:24.981
Let's turn the tableson this guy.

01:06:25.022 --> 01:06:28.651

'and threw him back.'

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.532
I'm not using someone's name

01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:37.284
to get a higher click-through.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.828
You don't have to do anything.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.413
I mean, there are plentyof people who are

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.998
perfectly happyworking on the beauty desk.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.666
I didn't thinkyou'd be one of them.

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:46.210
- 'But maybe I was wrong.'- Diane, I--

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.546

Great. Dead battery.

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:02.226
[sighing]

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:06.564
Hey, sorry.My call ran a little long.

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:08.983
Yeah, I got a call, too.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.444
You know, I'm kinda beat.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:14.071
I think I'm gonna head back upto the chalet.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.322
But you know, um, Sean and Megan

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:16.741
I think are gonna stayfor a while.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.410
Maybe you should hang outand stay with them.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:22.413
No, I, I gotta head back upanyway to get my truck.

01:07:22.496 --> 01:07:24.957
Some, some stuff came up.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:28.294
I gotta head back to the city.

01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:37.720
Yeah, okay.Um, well, you better get going.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:39.638
Right.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:42.183
The longer we wait,the harder it will be.

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:44.977
Best just to get it over with.

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.980
Sure.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:49.648
The drive, I mean.

- Congratulations.- Thank you. And to you, too.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.584
You deserve it. Yeah, yeah.

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:10.628
How is itI've never seen you before

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:12.755
and we live three blocks awayfrom each other?

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.758
I mean, maybe I was meantto run in to you here.

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:17.843
Run in to you, bump in to you.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.970

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:22.765
You know,this is gonna sound crazy

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:26.977
but I'm almost, almost gladthat you did.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:28.813
I mean,I haven't had this much fun

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.857
since, since I started working.

01:08:31.982 --> 01:08:33.651
Well, you say thatlike it has to end.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:35.778
Well, I am going home tomorrow.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.948
Yeah, true, but I was thinkingmaybe, uh, we could..

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:40.448
[bell ringing]

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.243
Guys, sorry to do this.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:45.703
We've just been informedthat the roads are closed.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.665
Now, they'll be back uponce the plows get through

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:50.876
but maybe find a comfy couch.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:52.837

- I guess this is it.- Yep. Drive safely.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:16.234
Anyway,I have a lot of writing to do.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.154
Yeah.

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:22.700
- Oh, great.- Let's see how bad it is.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.368
- Where's that little radio?- Ah, I got it.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.082

Yeah, hang on,my fingers are numb.

01:09:58.652 --> 01:10:00.237
Hurry up. Freezing.

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.323
Yeah. I don't get it.

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:05.534
'How did you manage to use allthose matches on the firepit?'

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.412
I had to. I couldn't usethe EZ-Lite logs.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.582
- Why not?- Because then you would've won.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:13.125

Who needs a lighterwhen you have a Girl Scout

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:24.178
a battery and still wood?

01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:29.058
[fire crackling]

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:31.518
You're a lot better at thatthan me.

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.479
Well, you must be goodat some things.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.814
How else would you becomethe CEO?

01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:40.361
Cara, I was trying to tell youbefore the auction.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.281
To be honest, I'm surprisedyou didn't figure it out.

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:47.618
What with, you know,being a journalist and all.

01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:50.079
What, is this..Do you have a problem with that?

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.164
You tell me.I might be a little biased.

01:10:52.289 --> 01:10:55.459
Journalists haven't alwaysgiven me a fair shake

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.919
'or done their fact-checking.'

01:10:57.002 --> 01:10:59.630
So that story about youwasn't true?

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.382
[sighs]

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.841
You read it?

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:08.931
And just so you know,I'm not that kind of journalist.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:13.394
I'm more on the...romanceand relationship beat.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:15.521
I write lists about dating.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.481
What, like,ten first-date don'ts?

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:19.984
It was actually 20, but, yeah.

01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:21.610
It's funnyyou should mention it.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.529
You know what the first one was?

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.449
Never leave abruptly.

01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:31.412
I guess I deserve that.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:33.998
Look, my publicist got upset

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.499
'when the picture of uswent live.'

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.210
He said it would be bestif I just left.

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:41.839
- So, it wasn't your idea?- No. Are you kidding?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.216
'I didn't want the nightto end.'

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.596
Look,I'm gonna tell you everything

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:50.806
and let you be the judge.

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:52.141
No matter how this endsbetween us

01:11:52.182 --> 01:11:54.935
I don't want it to bebecause of secrets.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.146
Will you just hear me out?

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:04.194
(Megan)Indoor camping.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:08.532
This is quite an endto the weekend, huh, Sean?

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.492
No complaints here.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.037
I mean, nothing went the way

01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:14.872
I thought it would this weekend

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:16.790
but, in a way

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:19.501
I thinkit was exactly what I needed

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.711
to get out of my work vibe.

01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:22.463
Don't I know it?

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:23.714
I mean, with my devices gone

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.967
and, let's face it,my boss gone

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.636
I realized how muchI'm missing out on life.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.389
'I need to make a change.'

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.392
I need a long-term plan.

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.645
I was, uh, more worried

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.606
about your short-term plan.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.816
Really? Why?

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.443
Like, I don't know.

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:47.821
Dinner, Monday?

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.492
I know this great Frenchrestaurant in our neighborhood.

01:12:51.575 --> 01:12:53.952
They serve a mean souffle.

01:12:56.663 --> 01:12:59.166
Maybe I can plan that far ahead.

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.835
So I'm in college in Boulder,boarding every day

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:05.714
and...I just think the boardscould be better, you know?

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.758
So I just start shaping my own

01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:09.593
just clowning around

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:12.012
with fiberglass and epoxyin my dorm room.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.098
But then, my friendsstart buying 'em.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.893
One of 'em goes pro, and, boom.Cyan was born.

01:13:17.976 --> 01:13:19.561
That sounds like a fairy tale.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.772
Yeah, it pretty much was

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:24.274
until we went public last year.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:25.859
Then the board of directorstook over

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:29.113
and they decided I was the brand

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:30.823
and my life stopped being mine.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:34.660
All of a sudden, the peopleI was with, the people I dated

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:36.954
they all affectedthe bottom line.

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.664
Something tells me this is where

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.083
the world-champion skiercomes in.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.627
You know, we were only datingfor about a month.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:47.798
She was training pretty hard,said I was distracting her

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.299
and so we broke up.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.885
A week later, she blew outher knee, tanked at the games

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.346
and the press decideda broken heart sounded better

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.181
than a broken knee.

01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:00.519
Of course,it ran just as we were launching

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:01.603
our women's line.

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:02.980
Oh.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.398
Board of directorsalmost fired me

01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:05.816
just to keep up appearances.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.860
Appearances?But the company's yours.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.987
No,it's the shareholders' company

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.656
and the board reports to them.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:16.493
They vote Mondayon if I get another term.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.203
So, what now?

01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:22.332
Well, they told meto stay out of the public eye.

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.542
Mm.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.629
You know, Ben,our lives are pretty different

01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.922
but I sort of get it

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:32.968
not knowing where you endand your work begins.

01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:35.512
That pretty much sums it up.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.933
But I was wrong not to justtell you all this stuff.

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:41.810
No, I can see why you didn't.

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:45.189
Look, we came up here to reset,not to meet someone.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.773
[chuckles]The whole Dating Cleanse--

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.567
- You know, Dat-Dating Cleanse?- Oh, yeah.

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.903
It's a series of articlesthat I'm writing to..

01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:52.613
Oh, no, what time is it?

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:55.407
Uh...11:45.

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.576
Ugh, I was supposedto get my last post in today

01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.203
and before midnight.

01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:00.537
Well, there's no onestopping you.

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:04.041
But I can't. My phone's deadand my laptop's dead.

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:05.709
Can it waittill the power's back on?

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.669
No, I have to do this now.

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:10.297
Otherwise, I might never.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.717
- Okay, well, use mine.- Yeah?

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.219
Yeah, got a few minutesof juice left

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.555
and, uh, I'll send it outwhen the Wi-Fi is back up.

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:20.724
Oh, thanks.

01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:22.935
This won't take long.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.937
Wait, you're doing it in there?It's freezing.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.396
Yeah, I have to.

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:28.982
What that skier said about youis true.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.068
'You are distracting.'

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.237
I'm gonna take thatas a compliment.

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:35.322
Don't get ahead of yourself.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.185
Yeah.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:07.104
It's weird how easy things are

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.106
when you knowwhat you need to do.

01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:11.108
- Think your boss will like it?- Tsk.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.860
I, I don't thinkit's what she's expecting

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:16.863
but let's just say,it's what she's getting.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.573
I'm kind of inspired.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:23.078
Believe it or not, I've cometo a realization this weekend.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.082
- What's that?- Some risks are worth taking.

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:33.714
Ah. Hey, hey, hey.We've come to rescue you guys.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:36.383
Ah, the stormfinally let up a bit.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.760
The roads opened upa little sooner than we thought.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.138
- Oh. Oh, look at that.- Oh.

01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:42.806
Hey, we can heat upthe pizza now.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.349
(Ben)'Uh, yeah. Uh, we've got wine.'

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:46.184
- We can have a picnic.- Yeah, have a seat.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.228
Unfortunately,we're gonna have to eat and run.

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:49.980
Yeah, this stormis just the opening.

'There's a bigger one comingin a few hours'

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.150
and the roads could be closedfor days.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.028
And I have a 6 a.m.hip replacement on Monday.

01:16:56.069 --> 01:16:58.155
- 'Sorry, buddy.'- Come on.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.532
I'm gonna start packing.I might need a hand.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:08.707
So it seems like our outing'scome to an end.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.293
So it seems.

01:17:11.376 --> 01:17:13.545
But we arein the same area code

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:16.923
which means I only have to askfor seven digits

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:20.052
of your phone number,which is way less awkward.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.262
[chuckles]Uh, I don't know.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.473
What if your companydoesn't approve?

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:27.517
If they don't, I might justhave to get a new company.

I'm just gonnawarm up the truck.

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:50.207
- You wanna explain this?- Look, Ben.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.875
I know what this looks like,but my boss

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.377
she sends methese headlines, and I--

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.129
- How did that even come up?- No, it's-it's from before.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:59.383
- Before what?- Before my phone died.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:00.926
Nothing you're sayingmakes any sense.

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.886
Okay, but you haveto believe me, please.

'This is justa big misunderstanding.'

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:08.308
Is it? Because it seems likeit's black and white.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.726
Uh, this is all my fault.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.813
I should've told youwhat I was working on before.

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.690
No, this is my fault.

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:18.485

Thanks for driving.

01:18:37.462 --> 01:18:39.464
Ah, if I keep my eyes onthe road, I won't have to think

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:42.259
about how badlyI messed things up with Ben.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.094

Ugh, my schedule's a mess.

and I know your businessbetter than anyone else.

I'm not sure yet.

01:24:56.549 --> 01:24:59.219

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:08.812
No speech, no press release?

Well, we arein the romance section.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.219

[chuckles]

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:45.473
