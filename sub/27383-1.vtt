gave ya the stink‐eye

00:12.539 --> 00:14.841
flippin' tires down the street
trying to look hard.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.877
Buddy, you're softer
than a Cinnabon sampler.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.612
You kiss your friend's
older sister once who

00:18.645 --> 00:20.246
who tastes like
Fisherman's Friends

00:20.280 --> 00:22.182
then you better do horn
to that memory ever since.

00:22.215 --> 00:24.450
You woke up with your horn
looking out the window

00:24.484 --> 00:26.186
but you gotta be
at work in 20.

00:26.219 --> 00:27.287
So it's now or never.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.489
Well, I should say.

00:29.523 --> 00:31.625
We're all excited that the Leafs
are doing betters and all's.

00:31.658 --> 00:33.293
But if they think's
you're payin' a buck‐twenty

00:33.326 --> 00:35.461
for upper bowl seats,
they can suck my babcock.

00:35.495 --> 00:37.731
You ripped a game of Buck Hunter
so fuckin' immaculate

00:37.764 --> 00:40.133
that bar has brought you in
through the kitchen ever since.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.602
Your gal likes goin'
for long drives,

00:41.635 --> 00:44.304
chit‐chattin' around town
like gas ain't a buck‐forty.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.672
With zero regard
for the amount of lawns

00:45.706 --> 00:47.240
you gotta mow
to fill the cocksucker.

00:47.273 --> 00:49.209
Your pal squeezed
into the same section

00:49.242 --> 00:51.912
of a revolving door behind you
one time and you're still pals.

00:51.945 --> 00:53.113
But, like,

00:53.146 --> 00:55.616
you're not about to sit beside
him at a fuckin' campfire.

00:55.649 --> 00:57.350
Jivin' Pete says
his new gal

00:57.383 --> 00:58.752
looks like
a young Shania Twain

00:58.785 --> 01:00.420
and you just don't have
the Timbits to tell him

01:00.453 --> 01:03.256
that she looks more like Post
Malone's fucked Dion Phaneuf's.

01:03.289 --> 01:05.191
You know it's tits‐up
for your ball team

01:05.225 --> 01:07.327
when the opposing pitcher's
got arms so big,

01:07.360 --> 01:09.162
he could throw
a cotton ball over a barn.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.330
You knew your pal
had come into money

01:10.363 --> 01:12.232
when he started throwing out
perfectly good pistachios,

01:12.265 --> 01:13.466
like he was above
cranking 'em open

01:13.499 --> 01:14.935
with a box cutter
like the rest of us.

01:14.968 --> 01:16.603
You're pretty sweet
on your new gal,

01:16.637 --> 01:18.805
but if she forgets to close
the third door of your truck

01:18.839 --> 01:20.440
before the passenger door
one more time,

01:20.473 --> 01:21.708
it's fuckin' over.
I've had it.

01:23.343 --> 01:24.377
You caught a whiff of a gals

01:24.410 --> 01:25.512

campfire smokes

01:25.546 --> 01:27.814
and that shit's got ya stiff
as a week‐old Slim Jims.

01:27.848 --> 01:30.717
Your friend's dad gets so mad
sometimes, he hollers "fuck,"

01:30.751 --> 01:33.554
but doesn't pronounce the C‐K
at the end, he's so squirrelly.

01:33.587 --> 01:34.755

01:34.788 --> 01:35.822

01:35.856 --> 01:37.257

05:57.483 --> 05:58.885
that he was
at the airport one time

05:58.919 --> 06:01.588
and he seen a dude
in the washroom at the urinal.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.489

his iPad while he...

06:03.524 --> 06:05.191

Rocked one, yeah.

06:08.128 --> 06:09.195

at the airport

06:09.229 --> 06:11.064
with his iPad on top
of the urinal

06:11.097 --> 06:12.866

while he rocked one?

so urgent?

this nut sac think he is?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.077

I'm going to tell you.

putting into the iPad.

could be so urgent.

that could be so urgent.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.155

a nuclear strike.

07:42.188 --> 07:43.389
That's who he is.

07:43.423 --> 07:46.026
And he had to get his portion
of the codes in immediately,

07:46.059 --> 07:47.894
so that the warheads
could take flight.

07:47.928 --> 07:49.095
Why's he firing
a warhead?

07:49.129 --> 07:52.232
Well, someone would have had
to fire a warhead first, right?

07:52.265 --> 07:54.034
You know, if I'm that dude
at the airport,

07:54.067 --> 07:55.702
with my dick out,
working on my iPad,

07:55.736 --> 07:57.137
I mean, the whole
fuckin' world's at stake.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.639
There's
multiple warheads?

07:58.672 --> 08:01.742
Both sides would have
to have warheads in the air

08:01.775 --> 08:04.210
or projectiles,
if it's nuclear war, yes.

08:04.244 --> 08:05.345
Those are some stakes.

08:05.378 --> 08:07.013
What else
could be so urgent?

08:07.047 --> 08:08.682
Not much else
could be so urgent.

08:08.715 --> 08:10.651
So the other three in the
political chain of command

08:10.684 --> 08:12.252
had already entered
their portion of the codes

08:12.285 --> 08:14.020

08:14.054 --> 08:15.889
we'll call him Gary,

08:15.922 --> 08:17.323
to enter his portion
of the codes.

08:17.357 --> 08:18.925
Hmm...
What?

08:18.959 --> 08:20.326

Gary's working it?

talking about here,

08:26.733 --> 08:28.301
one hand on his horn

Because if he's pissing
hands‐free,

typed in much faster.

10:23.249 --> 10:24.484
Probably no fun
for the dog

10:24.518 --> 10:25.886
to have to climb over
your thicksie's

10:25.919 --> 10:27.854
just to give you
a kiss in the face.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.023
All right. Come on, girl,
why don't we go?

10:30.056 --> 10:32.793
Let's leave the half‐blood
prince to his little sleeps.

10:39.766 --> 10:40.967
Good nap?

10:42.168 --> 10:43.203
Great nap.

10:43.236 --> 10:44.237
Nap with me?

10:45.405 --> 10:47.040
Well, I just kind of had a nap.

10:48.008 --> 10:49.242
Then we don't need
to sleep.

10:50.143 --> 10:52.245
(GIGGLING) Okay.

10:53.346 --> 10:55.348
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

11:00.821 --> 11:03.089
Sure we can't convince you guys
to sign with the summer squad?

11:03.123 --> 11:05.191
I got a pen you can borrow.
You know the one.

11:05.225 --> 11:06.292
Take my
writing utensil.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.194
We got a big hole
at the center

11:08.228 --> 11:09.262
and it needs to be filled.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.331
Back end's tight, but we
need to be deeper up front.

11:11.364 --> 11:13.433
Let's talk depth.
Show you a thing or two.

11:13.466 --> 11:14.801
Join our energy line.

11:14.835 --> 11:15.869
Keep those
fuckin' feet moving.

11:15.902 --> 11:17.137
I'm so fuckin' serious
right now.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.371
Daxi.
Ronsy.

11:18.404 --> 11:20.273
How about all the tail
around here, boys?

11:20.306 --> 11:21.908
Late June rush at the gymski.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.344
It's all the college and
uni kids home for the summer.

11:24.377 --> 11:26.212
Home to work
their summer jobs.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.314
I got a job you can work.
Let's fuckin' do it.

11:28.348 --> 11:30.416
The gettin's gonna be good
for a couple of months ferda.

11:30.450 --> 11:31.818
Summer's the goodest time
for gettin'

11:31.852 --> 11:33.854
and the gettin's
about to get got, get it?

11:33.887 --> 11:34.955
Got it.
Good.

11:34.988 --> 11:37.157
But what say
we make it interesting?

11:37.190 --> 11:38.859
Oh, it's already
interesting.

11:38.892 --> 11:40.894
Jesus...
I'll say, boys.

11:40.927 --> 11:43.163
I'll say, I could
jerk off right here.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.230
I swear to fuckin' God.

11:44.264 --> 11:46.299
But tell me, are you two
looking to fall in love

11:46.332 --> 11:47.400
or just fall in the sack?

11:47.433 --> 11:49.202
Buddy.
Sack.

11:49.235 --> 11:50.170
Thought so.

11:50.203 --> 11:51.872
Think you can fall in
more times than us?

11:53.139 --> 11:54.474
Fall in the sack?
Yeah.

11:54.508 --> 11:56.176
With girls?
Duh.

11:56.209 --> 11:57.944
Like can we take down
more babes than you?

11:57.978 --> 12:00.480
Can you take down more babes
than we can take down dudes?

12:00.514 --> 12:02.949
I'm gonna jerk off right here,
I swear to fuckin' Christ.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.150
Buddy, no contest.

12:04.184 --> 12:05.085
Save your money, boys.

12:05.118 --> 12:06.853
Are... Are you guys
like married though?

12:06.887 --> 12:08.021
We just wanted
to buy a house.

12:08.054 --> 12:09.089
Tax breaks there.

12:09.122 --> 12:11.157
We still smash
all sorts of ass.

12:11.191 --> 12:13.426
Never smashed
so much ass in my life.

12:13.459 --> 12:14.828
Cool.
Cool.

12:14.861 --> 12:16.196
So fuckin' cool.

12:16.229 --> 12:17.430
But you're confident
you smash more?

12:17.463 --> 12:19.399
Girls?
Duh.

12:19.432 --> 12:21.101
Absolutely. First of all,

12:21.134 --> 12:23.003
there aren't that many
gay dudes in Letterkenny.

12:23.036 --> 12:24.070
You'd be surprised.

12:24.104 --> 12:26.940
Small town kids going
to school in the big city?

12:26.973 --> 12:28.341
Out of the small town,

12:28.374 --> 12:30.076
out of the closet, boys.
Mmm.

12:30.110 --> 12:34.247
And second,
we get like... Take downs.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.951
Sometimes, wake up in the
morning and it's just like,

12:37.984 --> 12:39.019
start having
a take down.

12:39.052 --> 12:41.087
There's been like
a handful of times, actually,

12:41.121 --> 12:44.490
where I have to take a good look
in the mirror about take downs.

12:44.525 --> 12:45.526
REILLY: Sometimes,

12:45.559 --> 12:48.562
during the middle of a take down
thoughts creep in.

12:49.663 --> 12:50.897
So, we got a deal?

12:50.931 --> 12:51.965
Yeah, deal, totally.

12:51.998 --> 12:53.534
Cool. Our total
take‐down tally

12:53.567 --> 12:55.636
versus your total
take‐down tally.

12:55.669 --> 12:57.403
Deal.
What do the winners get?

12:57.437 --> 12:58.872
Case of beer?
Case of beer.

12:58.905 --> 13:00.974
Love a case of beer.
Deal. Case of beer.

13:01.007 --> 13:03.276
Here's to the opening
gay ceremonies, boys.

13:03.309 --> 13:05.278
Boys in for
the ceremonial fuck drop.

13:05.311 --> 13:08.048
I know a good horn section
for the event.

13:08.081 --> 13:09.182
Why don't ya give it
a little toot?

13:09.215 --> 13:10.584
Come on,
give it a little blast.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.619
I'm gonna have sex
with some girls!

13:12.653 --> 13:16.523
ALL: Ferda!

13:16.557 --> 13:19.860
(GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING)

13:23.496 --> 13:25.098
Bonnie.
Wayne.

13:25.131 --> 13:26.633
Hi there.
Hi, dare.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.334
I'll have
the pinot noir, please.

13:28.368 --> 13:29.670
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Is that what you'll take, then?

13:29.703 --> 13:31.171
Not a good look, Bonnie.

13:31.471 --> 13:32.539
Beer?

13:32.573 --> 13:33.940
Please and thank you.

13:38.579 --> 13:40.346
She was being
a bit of a cow, eh?

13:40.380 --> 13:43.183
That's McMurray's sister.
She comes by it honestly.

13:43.216 --> 13:44.150
She's pretty.

13:44.184 --> 13:46.520
Oh, she's a lovely girl,
for the most part.

13:46.553 --> 13:49.055
So much petty hostility between
English and French.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.423
Yeah, it's a bit obnoxious,
isn't it?

13:50.456 --> 13:51.625
I'm glad
we agree on that.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.059
As long as we can also agree

13:53.093 --> 13:54.595
that French toast
is a waste of time.

13:54.628 --> 13:56.062
So are
English muffins.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.230
There ya go.

14:01.234 --> 14:02.402
I was thinking about the dude

14:02.435 --> 14:03.469
McMurray saw at the airport.

14:03.504 --> 14:05.205
There's a lot
to unpack there, eh?

14:05.238 --> 14:06.306
You're Gary.
Mmm‐hmm...

14:06.339 --> 14:07.541
You're one of the four.
Mmm‐hmm.

14:07.574 --> 14:10.544
Your secretary calls and says
the country needs the codes.

14:11.578 --> 14:13.313
It wouldn't be a secretary.
Eh?

14:13.346 --> 14:15.315
It'd be one
of the other three.

14:15.348 --> 14:17.050
I think you're right.
I'm for sure right.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.152
The other three wouldn't likely
trust Gary's secretary

14:19.185 --> 14:20.721
with news
of incoming projectiles.

14:20.754 --> 14:21.722
Marie‐Fred, you don't trust

14:21.755 --> 14:23.690
the fuckin' secretary
with the projectiles.

14:23.724 --> 14:25.191
The secretary wouldn't have
been sworn in

14:25.225 --> 14:26.527
like the other
government officials.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.328
Who knows who
the secretary's working for?

14:28.361 --> 14:29.730
Secretary could be workin'
for anybody.

14:29.763 --> 14:32.265
There'd be protocol in place.
It would be in writing.

14:32.298 --> 14:34.267
That information
would be so classified.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.302
You know how classified
that information would be?

14:36.336 --> 14:37.203
Super classified?

14:37.237 --> 14:39.239
One tier up.
It'd be ultra classified.

14:39.272 --> 14:40.306
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

14:40.340 --> 14:41.341
Do you wanna know what?

14:41.374 --> 14:42.576
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it here.

14:42.609 --> 14:44.044
If I'm one of the four,

14:44.077 --> 14:46.112
I get that information
from the horse's mouth

14:46.146 --> 14:47.514
or you're not getting
the codes.

14:47.548 --> 14:49.583
Wanna take about 20% off?

14:49.616 --> 14:51.552
Yeah, I'd take
about 20% off 'er.

14:51.585 --> 14:54.120
So, you're Gary.
Mmm‐hmm.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.021
One of the other three

14:55.055 --> 14:56.456
commanding government
officials says,

14:56.489 --> 14:58.559
"We need the codes. Stat.
Mmm‐hmm. Mmm‐hmm.

14:58.592 --> 15:01.528
"This is it, Gary.
Nuclear war!"

15:01.562 --> 15:03.764
Jesus Christ,
it's nuclear war.

15:03.797 --> 15:05.999
What do you do?

15:08.669 --> 15:10.003
I'd piss myself.

15:10.036 --> 15:11.171
Bingo.
I'd have to go,

15:11.204 --> 15:12.238
at the very least.

15:12.272 --> 15:13.139
Of course, you would.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.440
I don't know
if I'd be able to hold it.

15:14.474 --> 15:16.276
But I'd be sayin',
"Whoa...

15:16.309 --> 15:18.211
"You'd better
fuckin' hold onto her."

15:18.244 --> 15:19.279
It's an appropriate
physical response

15:19.312 --> 15:20.647
to news
of incoming warheads.

15:20.681 --> 15:22.348
It'd be alarming.

15:22.382 --> 15:24.518
But let's not forget,
you're Gary.

15:24.551 --> 15:25.752
Yeah. Yeah.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.453
You've got responsibilities
if you're Gary.

15:27.487 --> 15:28.488
You've got the codes.

15:28.522 --> 15:30.423
Whole country's counting
on you if you're Gary.

15:30.456 --> 15:33.359
Women and children,
the elderly.

15:33.393 --> 15:36.362
So, you're Gary, you get
the call for the codes...

15:36.396 --> 15:38.031
You say holy shit...
You'd say holy shit...

15:38.064 --> 15:40.634
I'm gonna piss myself...
But it's nuclear war.

15:40.667 --> 15:44.037
And despite nuclear war,
all this at stake,

15:44.070 --> 15:48.041
Gary's still pissing
while he puts in the codes.

15:50.376 --> 15:51.411
You wanna know what?

15:51.444 --> 15:52.378
What?

15:52.412 --> 15:54.280
The washroom had to have
been right there.

15:54.314 --> 15:55.248
It had to have been
right there.

15:55.281 --> 15:57.150
He might already
have been in the washroom.

15:57.183 --> 15:58.251
I think he was
already in there.

15:58.284 --> 16:01.287
You're Gary, you're in
the washroom, you get the call,

16:01.321 --> 16:03.256
need the codes.
I'm gonna piss myself.

16:03.289 --> 16:06.126
And he got his iPad out
as fast as he got his dick out?

16:06.159 --> 16:08.094
He was for sure
already in the washroom.

16:08.128 --> 16:09.429
Might've already
been on the iPad.

16:09.462 --> 16:13.266
Well, that solves it!
It was a convenience thing then.

16:13.299 --> 16:15.769
You're Gary, you're in the
washroom, you get the call,

16:15.802 --> 16:17.538
need the codes.
"Well, I can get you the codes,

16:17.571 --> 16:18.639
"but I'm gonna piss myself."

16:18.672 --> 16:20.140
And he got the codes in,

16:20.173 --> 16:21.575
but didn't piss himself
because...

16:21.608 --> 16:24.711
BOTH: Because he was
already in the washroom.

16:24.745 --> 16:25.646
Jesus Christ,

16:25.679 --> 16:27.347
the world could use
a couple of more Garys.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.550
I think we've sleuthed
it out, partner.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.351
Bless ya
for tryin' on "sleuth,"

16:31.384 --> 16:33.820
but, uh, yeah, I think we have
sleuthed it out, partner.

16:33.854 --> 16:35.522
How's your French coming?

16:35.556 --> 16:38.825
Well... (SPEAKING FRENCH)

16:47.801 --> 16:49.836
The only thing is...

16:49.870 --> 16:51.171
We'd know if there was

16:51.204 --> 16:52.238
a nuclear strike
that was intercepted.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.707
Like, it'd be
in the news.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.877
Ah, come on. That many
projectiles in the air?

16:56.910 --> 16:58.411
Let's get real here.

16:58.444 --> 16:59.412
Warheads or not,

16:59.445 --> 17:01.347
we'd know about it.
Like, we'd know it happened.

17:01.381 --> 17:03.550
Yeah. The government
wouldn't want us to know,

17:03.584 --> 17:04.785
but someone would leak it.

17:04.818 --> 17:06.319
I'm looking
at the secretary.

17:07.621 --> 17:08.722
Beer for you, Wayne.

17:08.755 --> 17:09.823
Thank you, Bonnie.

17:09.856 --> 17:11.357
And da pinot noir for 'er.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.396
Ew. Too French.

17:16.429 --> 17:17.430
Bonnie...

17:17.463 --> 17:20.300
Why don't you go sit down
and drink your wine?

17:21.201 --> 17:22.302
What if I don't?

17:22.335 --> 17:25.506
(IN FUNNY ACCENT) Den I'd
have to put my wine down.

17:36.282 --> 17:38.484
It's bush
party season, boys.

17:38.519 --> 17:39.620
'Tis the season.

17:39.653 --> 17:41.287
Seasons greetings.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.156
You know, I'm gonna make
some Caesars with the girls

17:43.189 --> 17:44.558
and get geared up
for a gooder.

17:44.591 --> 17:45.726
Oh, I'd have a Caesar.

17:45.759 --> 17:47.861
KATY: You can't really see
a Caesar and not want a Caesar.

17:47.894 --> 17:49.896
DAN: That's actually
how they market Caesars.

17:59.405 --> 18:00.741
Wayne?

18:00.774 --> 18:01.808
Dary.

18:01.842 --> 18:03.176
Can I bend your ear
about something?

18:03.209 --> 18:04.277
What are you, a bender?

18:04.310 --> 18:05.846
Good one.
Heard it from a cow.

18:05.879 --> 18:07.914
I know it's impolite
to kiss and tell, but...

18:07.948 --> 18:10.617
I wouldn't say
that's universal, but, okay.

18:14.788 --> 18:16.790
Between us girls.
Yeah, between us girls.

18:19.325 --> 18:21.161
You ever thrown
so much hip in your life?

18:27.801 --> 18:30.236
Between us girls?
Yeah. Between us girls.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.705
I've never thrown
so much hip in my life.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.208
How much hip
we talking?

18:35.241 --> 18:36.142
I'm talkin'
like I'll be

18:36.176 --> 18:37.711
halfway through
a bowl of cereal and...

18:37.744 --> 18:38.779
Hip.
Oh, yeah.

18:38.812 --> 18:39.846
Oh, man.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.314
Same for you?
Oh, yeah.

18:41.347 --> 18:42.482
Is that right?

18:46.587 --> 18:47.621
Between us girls?

18:47.654 --> 18:48.722
Of course,
between us girls.

18:50.624 --> 18:52.292
I feel like we met,

18:52.325 --> 18:53.459
I punched in

18:53.493 --> 18:54.561
and I haven't
punched out.

18:54.595 --> 18:56.362
Can I ask you
something?

18:56.396 --> 18:57.698
Of course,
good buddy.

18:57.731 --> 18:59.966
You feel like you're gettin'
any better at it?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.367
I feel like I'm gettin'
a lot better at it.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.736
Me too.

19:02.769 --> 19:04.571
And I kind of feel like
I was a bit of a novice

19:04.605 --> 19:05.706
with the whole thing before.

19:06.907 --> 19:08.675
I feel
that way, too.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.243
I feel like
with some of the gals

19:10.276 --> 19:11.845
I'd done some yessin'
with in the past,

19:11.878 --> 19:13.747
they might have thought,
"This guy's a dabbler."

19:13.780 --> 19:16.249
Dary, that's exactly
how I feel.

19:16.282 --> 19:18.251
Like, I feel like they might
have seen me as a hopeful,

19:18.284 --> 19:19.753
at the very least.

19:19.786 --> 19:23.557
Or like, maybe I was just
apprenticing at the time.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.726
I kind of feel like I might be
a bit of a headliner now.

19:25.759 --> 19:26.893
Really?
Oh, yeah.

19:26.927 --> 19:30.396
What are we talking, like
large theaters or stadiums?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.899
Well, large theaters
for the time being.

19:32.933 --> 19:34.768
But like, if you can
keep going at the rate

19:34.801 --> 19:36.803
you're going, you'll be
destined for, like...

19:36.837 --> 19:38.371
BOTH: Bigger venues. Yeah.

19:38.404 --> 19:39.573
That's exactly
how I feel.

19:39.606 --> 19:40.707
That's how
I feel, too.

19:41.775 --> 19:43.043
MARIE‐FREDERIQUE:
Who wants a Caesar?

19:43.076 --> 19:44.878
Oh, I'd have
a Caesar.

19:44.911 --> 19:46.547
Can't see a Caesar and
not want a Caesar.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.481
ANIK: That's actually how
they market Caesars.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.952
Is Stewart gonna DJ
this bush party?

19:51.985 --> 19:52.819
Wanna know what?
I haven't seen that

19:52.853 --> 19:54.855
fuckin' nut sac
in the longest time.

19:56.657 --> 19:57.924
I wonder where
he's off to.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.993
