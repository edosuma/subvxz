WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.160
Let the fun commence.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.760
(cheering)

00:09.840 --> 00:11.400
'It's Ex on the Beach.'

00:14.400 --> 00:18.680
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.760 --> 00:22.040
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.640
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.720 --> 00:28.400
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.480 --> 00:30.440
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.520 --> 00:33.400
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.480 --> 00:37.320
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.400 --> 00:40.000
(shouting, laughter)

00:41.880 --> 00:44.720
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.800 --> 00:46.400
I do really, really love him.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.040
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.120 --> 00:51.480
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:51.560 --> 00:52.880
Let go now!

00:52.960 --> 00:55.080
No-one fucking likes you!
See ya later.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.240
'And others just want to
wreck the gaff.'

00:59.520 --> 01:01.080
Hey!
(clattering)

01:01.160 --> 01:03.920
Fuck! That'll be someone's
fucking head in a minute.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.840
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:07.920 --> 01:11.120
It's gonna be fucking fireworks.
'...causing misery...'

01:11.200 --> 01:12.560
(sobs)
What am I gonna do?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.720
You will never ever have me
ever again.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.960
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:17.040 --> 01:19.440
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:20.600 --> 01:23.960
Oh!
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:24.040 --> 01:25.560
Fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:25.640 --> 01:28.560
(shouting)
Fucking slag!

01:28.640 --> 01:31.520
'So far, nine exes have arrived.'

01:31.600 --> 01:33.280
'But whose...'

01:33.360 --> 01:35.520
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.000
'...ex...'

01:37.080 --> 01:38.360
'...is...'

01:39.640 --> 01:41.000
'...next?'

01:41.080 --> 01:43.040
My heart is breaking.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.760
Things between me and Ross
ended again.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.720
I can't look at you, or talk to you,
I can't be friends.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.520
I care about you too much.
I wanted a future with you.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.920
Everywhere I look
you and her are together.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.280
I need to get away from Ross,
get away from Becca.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.960
I'd never trust her
and she's not a friend.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.480
I do have feelings for Harriette,
but time to start a new chapter.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.680
I do like Becca.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.760
She's good looking
and I do fancy her.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.000
That's who I'm gonna go to.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.760
Nothing with me and Ross going on.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.880
Potentially, there might be a
little, tiny bit of hope left

02:48.960 --> 02:50.920
for me to make things up with Aaron.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.360
I sat next to him at breakfast
and he didn't run off.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.800
(laughs)

02:59.080 --> 03:01.760
Me and Becca have to live here,
so I will be civil,

03:01.840 --> 03:04.120
but I'm not gonna be her best mate.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.520
I'm really good today.
I'm in a good place.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.800
I wanted to come in here
and make friends,

03:09.880 --> 03:12.440
so let's see how that goes.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.840
Morning.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.920
S'appening?
All right?

03:18.680 --> 03:21.320
I can't even look at the bird,
she's fucking sick.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.320
Sorry for coming in yesterday
and causing a storm.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.920
You're a slag.
why are you standing by me?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I didn't know
you were sitting there.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.840
Fuck off, you slag!
Get away from me.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.080
Fucking ugly. You fucked everyone.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.720
Fuck's sake.
I'm never making friends.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.920
I didn't come here
to argue with you.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.960
You came in cos you're a slag
and love opening your legs.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.600
That's why you're here!
She's going mental.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.400
You fucked every boy I know.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.440
Adam's mates, you've had
a threesome with Jack.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.160
Fuck getting involved in this.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.080
Don't fuck me over again!

03:54.160 --> 03:55.920
You knew I was with Jacques!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.880
She's a fucking lunatic.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.320
Stop lying!

03:59.400 --> 04:02.320
Being in the villa with Frankie
and Nicole is mental.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.640
I just want Frankie
to fuck off, mate.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.680
Stop lying about you didn't know.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.640
I didn't know.
You fucking knew!

04:08.720 --> 04:12.080
I am sick of hearing
Jacques Frasier's lies.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.360
I hate him.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.279
You've lied the whole time.
You're a liar.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.079
She's a fucking liar.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.240
She's telling the truth, yeah,
but she's an absolute liar.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.440
How can you say she's mugging you
off, but you fucked her.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.520
Don't fuck someone
and give them shit.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.240
Course I'm gonna give her shit.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.840
You fucking lied
about the whole situation.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.840
Jacques's calling Frankie a liar, but
he's the biggest liar in the house.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.640
He's come in from day one
and lied through his teeth.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.000
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth
and all, you old cunt.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.000
Fucking sleep with you?
I'd rather eat dog shit.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.200
A lorry-load of it and all.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.280
Anyway, let's talk to everyone
apart from you, cunt.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.000
How's everyone feeling?

04:51.080 --> 04:54.400
I'm having an absolutely
fucking sublime day.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.280
Frankie and Jacques
are irrelevant to my life now

04:58.360 --> 05:00.640
I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.640
'What a lovely way to start the day.'

05:07.160 --> 05:11.400
'And it's about to get a whole lot
worse when the next ex washes up.'

05:11.480 --> 05:13.720
'T minus one hour.'

05:13.800 --> 05:15.640
(evil laugh)

05:18.400 --> 05:20.040
Me and Becca are fully over,

05:20.120 --> 05:25.160
but if I want to move on, I need to
know we can finally close that book.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.880
You don't care about me, do you?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.480
Yes, I do!
Do you fuck.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.680
Yes, I do.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.560
I thought, I've got my best friend
back and the person I love, but...

05:35.640 --> 05:39.080
I thought that's what
it would have led to. But it didn't.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.720
I would have. I would have, Becca.
And you know that.

05:49.920 --> 05:54.400
I fucked it. The decisions I've made
have fucked everything between us.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.600
You had the chance.
This is what I don't get.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.600
Right? You had the chance, Becca.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.200
I was the love of his life.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.320
Seeing Becca upset breaks my heart,

06:14.400 --> 06:18.080
but as getting back with her is
concerned, it will never happen.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.600
I couldn't get back with her now.
No way.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.120
Knowing she's had sex
with someone in here, no way.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.040
How are you, trouble?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
After a good day
with Becca yesterday,

06:38.200 --> 06:40.840
I'm hoping today we can
carry on where we left off.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.760
I had a day with you yesterday

06:43.840 --> 06:46.800
and that was the best day
I've had in the villa.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.040
He's trying to crack on with me,
it's fucking awkward.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.720
I like you. (laughs)

07:03.920 --> 07:06.080
Oh, God, I can't fucking do this.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.680
She's got feelings for him,
so I ain't gonna fight.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.520
So, looks like
I'm back to Harriette.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.680
'Ooh, lucky Harriette.'

07:24.760 --> 07:26.400
(evil laugh)

07:30.480 --> 07:32.680
'After an eventful morning
in the villa,

07:32.760 --> 07:36.400
the tablet has sent Adam, Josh
and Nicole to the Beach of Doom.'

07:38.400 --> 07:41.120
I'm fucking shitting my knickers.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.600
I'd be nervous if I was you,
cos you've slept with dirty girls.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.640
I'll second that.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.000
Cheeky!

07:48.960 --> 07:51.200
Got a bit of poo in my pants.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.800
What about your exes, Nicole?
Mate, she has plenty of exes.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.680
I've got four in the villa already.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.520
If another ex comes in, you might
as well call it the Nicole show.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.160
Adam, your arsehole
seems to be twitching, son.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.800
Oh, ho, ho.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.520
Y'all right, motherfuckers?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.280
Hello, Shit Quiff.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.159
Hey, Joshy Woshy with his shit quiff.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.600
My name's Chanelle McCleary,
I'm from Manchester

08:37.679 --> 08:42.039
and I'm a fucking loon. (laughs)

08:42.120 --> 08:45.280
Dunno if you'll wake up to
me stabbing ya, or sucking you off.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.800
(laughs)

08:47.880 --> 08:52.480
So, obviously, these are fake.
I've had my teeth done, my eyelashes.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.680
I go out looking like Beyonce and
fall in looking like Lindsay Lohan.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.800
(laughs)

08:58.880 --> 09:00.400
I've got an ex called Josh.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.040
I mean, I've seen more intellect
in a potato than Josh.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.000
There's nothing there.
And nothing there.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.600
He needs to be told.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.800
Is it a family show? Or can we swear?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.320
You can swear as much as you like.
Fucking hell.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.280
You've got shit banter,

09:15.360 --> 09:17.600
shit fucking sex drive
and a shit quiff.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.760
You lasted
nought point five seconds, right?

09:20.840 --> 09:24.000
I asked you to rub my fucking clit,
you rubbed my fanny flaps.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.040
What the fuck is that meant to do?

09:26.120 --> 09:29.680
I want Chanelle
to piss off back into the sea.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.400
I don't fucking like her.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.680
Hello.
I dunno what to say. I'm speechless.

09:34.760 --> 09:38.480
The only thing I can focus on are
the big moustaches on her forehead.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.400
What the fuck are those?
Don't come out like that.

09:41.480 --> 09:45.680
Chanelle is loud,
butters and a cunt.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.120
Get back in the sea, you old well.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.360
I have no issue with you,
don't make one.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.080
Don't point in my face.
Don't make an issue with me.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.480
You troll.

09:54.560 --> 09:58.280
I'm nice, but be a bitch to me
and I'll be a bigger bitch back

09:58.360 --> 10:00.280
and that ain't gonna be cute.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.880
Why are you being a bitch?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
Cos you're shouting your mouth off.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.960
Cos I can! And I will!

10:06.040 --> 10:08.240
Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.000
I'll shout how much I want!
Shut up!

10:11.080 --> 10:14.160
I'm not scared of no-one!
I ain't scared of no-one neither!

10:14.240 --> 10:15.360
Fuck off then!

10:15.440 --> 10:17.840
Swill her! Swill her! Swill her!

10:17.920 --> 10:20.080
Ding, ding, bring it fucking on.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.480
Shut your mouth.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.840
She's given me a headache
in two minutes.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.840
(laughter)

10:25.920 --> 10:27.600
(Tablet of Terror chimes)

10:27.680 --> 10:29.400
Fuck off, Tablet of Terror.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.040
"Welcome, Chanelle,
don't forget it takes two to tango."

10:33.120 --> 10:37.120
"Try not to get your head in a spin
as you get closer to Adam."

10:37.200 --> 10:40.640
(laughs)

10:40.720 --> 10:43.560
I'm fucking so glad it's not me.
Thank fuck for that.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.360
I only fucked you
cos my mate gave me 50 quid.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.560
(laughs)

10:47.640 --> 10:51.000
Josh is getting cocky, cos he's got
a big ego, yet he's shit in bed

10:51.080 --> 10:53.080
and I just wanna fucking grab him.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.280
Stop acting the big man,
you fucking cunt!

10:58.360 --> 11:01.600
Go away, you cunt.
Fucking dickhead. Fucking dick.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.520
Fuck off!

11:03.600 --> 11:05.960
You think I'm a fucking dickhead?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.920
I think it's gonna be a little bit
awks when I get back to the villa.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.240
Just a little bit awkward.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.160
Fucking stupid girl.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.480
(laughter)

11:21.880 --> 11:24.440
I think we've had
an easy ride until you came in.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.000
There's not been
that many bad exes really.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.880
(Tablet of Terror chimes)

11:28.960 --> 11:30.600
(laughter)

11:30.680 --> 11:32.800
For fuck's sake!

11:32.880 --> 11:37.600
"The villa is getting a bit crowded,
so someone must go home."

11:37.680 --> 11:39.560
What the fuck?

11:39.640 --> 11:42.720
"Sean, the power's in your hands.
Choose wisely."

11:42.800 --> 11:45.400
Bosh. I know
who I'm fucking sending.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.600
Fuck off.
I'm here.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.760
Or what? Or fucking what?

11:48.840 --> 11:52.920
Jacques, I think from day one,
we got off on the wrong foot.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.240
Fuck off. I don't give a fuck
about the lad.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.360
Ding, ding, here we go again.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.280
What the fuck could happen here?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.960
Yeah, it's cool. It is what it is.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.080
I'm all right. I'm good.
I could do with getting home.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.480
Right, I'll catch you in a bit.
(all) Bye.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.880
(mimicking Jacques)
I'll go. I get it. I'll go home.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.280
I'm quite an honest person. There's
nothing I hate more than a liar.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.720
Adam told me
you cheated on me in Ibiza.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
That's absolute bullshit.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.000
No-one was in my room.
Like I'd cheat.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.840
It's all fucking rumours.
Nah, mate. Didn't happen.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.400
Bullshit, bruv. Bullshit.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.600
It's bullshit.
Course I fucking ain't.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.840
I've just told you, "No."
Simple as that. It didn't happen.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.800
I didn't cheat on you. It's rumours.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.840
I do regret ever doubting him.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.640
I can't break your heart, cos it's
not true. It's an allegation.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.280
I know I never.
I didn't go through with it.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.560
I thought better of it.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.240
Nothing can ever split us up.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.200
You need to tell the truth.
I mugged you off.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.760
You're chatting shit.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.640
100% I did not. I thought better.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.800
You knew. You lied. You liar.
She's a fucking liar.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.400
She's telling the truth, yeah,
but she's a liar.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.000
How's everyone feeling
with my decision?

13:29.080 --> 13:32.280
I'm glad he's fucked off,
cos he was creating a divide.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.800
(cheering, shouting)

13:35.880 --> 13:38.120
Oh, my God. Josh got attacked.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.600
Oh, no.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.560
All I hear was...
Josh...

13:41.640 --> 13:44.760
All I hear... Shut up, Frankie,
I still don't like you.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.160
All I hear was,
"All right, fuckers?"

13:47.240 --> 13:50.720
Actually, she jumped
on top of him like a nutter.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.400
She's attacked him, so if she comes
in, things are gonna go off.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.000
Wait, before we get started.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.560
I gotta tell you something.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.960
Power was given to me
to send someone home.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.720
And I've sent Jacques.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.680
All right. Sweet.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.240
He's the love of my life and I found
out he slept with someone else.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.640
I just feel like
I've been so mugged off

14:11.720 --> 14:13.640
that maybe this will do me good.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.920
It's not a case of onwards and
upwards with me and Jacques.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.520
You don't burn a bitch twice
and get away with it.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.200
How do you feel about Adam?

14:21.280 --> 14:25.080
I fucked Adam over, cos he was
trying to look out for me.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.360
I feel like a prat.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.320
I care about Adam
and I care about his feelings.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.160
I wish I could go back in time
and get back to stage one.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.840
All I can say is, "Sorry".
What else can I say?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.440
'Watch out Nicole.'

14:40.520 --> 14:46.120
'As Chanelle might be two steps away
from getting to Adam first.'

14:46.200 --> 14:47.320
Hey, you all right?

14:47.400 --> 14:49.640
Hello, guys.
Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.240
I might swap you with her.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.480
(laughter)

14:53.560 --> 14:55.720
He's cracking on with the teacher,

14:55.800 --> 14:59.320
I'm on a date with you.
Hell to the no.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.680
Let's go. So, one, two...

15:03.960 --> 15:06.920
I don't like you looking at her
over your shoulder.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.240
You're on a date with me.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.320
He's stood there watching her
like a fucking hawk.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.320
OK. Now you're gonna do
a body roll to your partner.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.720
Like that. OK?

15:16.800 --> 15:17.880
Come here, you.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.000
Fucking fit.
Oh, my God.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.600
Let's take her home with us.
Eager beaver.

15:22.680 --> 15:27.160
Five, six, seven
and one, two three, tap.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.320
So, it's a bit boring, really.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.880
I'm gonna show her how we slut drop.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.000
(laughs)

15:42.080 --> 15:44.280
What the fuck is she doing?

15:59.640 --> 16:02.200
(laughs)

16:02.280 --> 16:06.080
(laughs) She's fucking mad.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.320
Shabba-zay!

16:11.320 --> 16:13.040
(cheering)

16:15.800 --> 16:18.000
We're playing a game
of sexual positions.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.280
You got knickers on? (laughs)

16:20.360 --> 16:23.320
And, yeah, there is a bit of
flirting between me and my ex.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.000
And what?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.720
(indistinct)

16:26.800 --> 16:29.160
(laughs)

16:29.240 --> 16:33.520
She's flirting with Jack.
I feel a little bit shit.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.000
Chanelle's gonna be like Marmite,
everyone's gonna love her,

16:44.080 --> 16:45.840
or they're gonna hate her, so...

16:45.920 --> 16:47.360
...let's see what happens.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.480
Whoa!

16:50.560 --> 16:52.280
Whey!

16:52.360 --> 16:53.840
For fuck's sake.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.240
She can stay away from me now,
the knobhead.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
Hello!
Hello!

16:58.400 --> 17:01.480
Positive vibes,
peace and tranquillity,

17:01.560 --> 17:03.080
let's all be friends.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.599
Josh is one of my closest boys
and I'm not happy about his neck.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.560
I don't give a shit. (screams)

17:11.839 --> 17:13.000
What the fuck's this?

17:13.079 --> 17:15.000
(screams)

17:15.079 --> 17:16.760
(screams)
(screams)

17:16.839 --> 17:18.960
(screams)
(screams)

17:19.040 --> 17:21.280
(screams)
(screams)

17:21.359 --> 17:24.240
(all screaming)

17:24.319 --> 17:26.440
Oh, my God, shut your mouth.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.240
Fuck off!

17:28.319 --> 17:29.560
Fucking weirdo.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.240
That girl needs a fucking exorcism.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.000
Your fanny flaps
are hanging out, man.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.640
I can smell your fanny
from here, fuck off.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.440
I'm lost for words.
It's like the Long Ness monster.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.640
Whey! I'm a fucking wrong 'un,
and what?

17:43.720 --> 17:47.000
She's fucking cuckoo, the girl.
Imagine what she'd do in bed.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.320
Let's do the dab!

17:49.400 --> 17:52.800
Like, even I'm shocked.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.480
Despite her loud mouth,
Chanelle's got big boobs, big bum.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.520
I'd love to fuck her.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.000
'Better not let Zahida
hear you say that.'

18:04.800 --> 18:07.080
'But will it really matter
when the next ex

18:07.160 --> 18:10.400
comes to destroy all your lives?'

18:10.480 --> 18:13.160
'Whose ex is next?'

18:19.720 --> 18:21.720
I don't wanna lose Adam.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.280
I love and care
about the boy to bits.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.640
I'm sorry if I upset you.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.480
You didn't upset me, I don't mind.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.480
The minute her boyfriend
come into the house,

18:39.560 --> 18:41.560
she dropped me like a sack of shit.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.240
Now she's found out he cheated,
she's trying to get back in my life.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.080
What, am I her rebound now?
Second best cos he's a cheat?

18:57.960 --> 19:01.400
Don't love me now cos you found out
your ex-boyfriend's cheated.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.720
That's not a reason to love me.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.760
Moving forward,
I'm gonna tell her how I feel,

19:16.840 --> 19:20.160
cos I've realised I do like this
girl, I do wanna be with her.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.000
I can't keep fucking her about.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.160
At the end of the day,
all that's stopping us moving forward

19:25.240 --> 19:28.120
is you don't know where you stand
and I don't know.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.040
Enough of these discussions
that go round and round.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.240
Grow a pair of bollocks
and tell me you wanna be with me.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.560
You said to me you don't wanna
be boyfriend and girlfriend,

19:37.640 --> 19:40.040
but you can't be my friend.
(sighs)

19:40.120 --> 19:44.080
As much as I try
and be brave and think that...

19:44.160 --> 19:46.800
Come on, Ross, fucking say it.
Be a man.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.600
So, what do you want, cos...
What do you want?

19:49.680 --> 19:50.720
I wanna be with you.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.720
What do you mean wanna be with me?

19:53.800 --> 19:56.400
Me and Ross being official
is amazing.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.720
(laughs)

20:02.280 --> 20:04.600
She's my girlfriend!

20:05.720 --> 20:08.920
Back in bed with Harriette,
I'm gonna get a bang.

20:15.240 --> 20:19.000
I need to have a chat with Nicole
and put an end to it,

20:19.080 --> 20:21.560
cos all of these games,
it's not fair, like.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.320
Now I'm looking like a mug,
like some rebound.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.760
Don't think that of me.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.480
It's not a rebound,
I never want Adam to think he is.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.960
I genuinely, genuinely do love him.
Like, a lot.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.360
Let me talk, right? We have
so much fun and we're close.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.240
As soon as Jacques come in, yeah?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.320
That all changed.
But hold on, Adam...

20:44.400 --> 20:47.000
You come in here... Let me talk.
That all changed.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.800
Let me tell you...
He cheated, now it's un-changed.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.800
It's not.
You split up cos he cheated.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.120
You cheated on me...

20:54.200 --> 20:57.360
I can't help the way I feel
about someone else. I'm sorry.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.320
That's all I can say.
I can't say anything else.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.160
Now he's left, you're being nice.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.400
I will always be nice to you
cos I feel like a cunt.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.960
I can't help it.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.560
You're never gonna be a rebound,
cos I loved you.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.480
I feel second best, mate.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.800
To be honest.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.560
I need a break, man.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.520
'The night has taken its toll
and everyone's gone to bed.'

21:32.600 --> 21:34.880
'Well, not everyone.'

21:37.400 --> 21:41.560
'But for Ross and Harriette,
things are only getting started.'

21:41.640 --> 21:43.640
Had such an amazing day.

21:43.720 --> 21:47.400
Tonight's even better, and I'm gonna
end it with my boyfriend,

21:47.480 --> 21:50.120
in the penthouse
with a bottle of champagne.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.640
'Ho, ho, ho! Looks like there's more
than a bottle of champagne waiting.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.800
Yay! Can I go now?

22:16.520 --> 22:19.640
I've woke up this morning
and I want a fucking shag.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.760
I just hope Becca doesn't
fucking cock block us.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.000
I'm fucking well gutted that me
and Aaron are completely fucked.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.160
Just a head-fuck.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.920
I don't think anything can ruin
what me and Sean have right now.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.360
We're just so passionate
about each other.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.840
I've woken up
with Zahida again this morning.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.560
I'm getting fucking bored of this.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.600
I can't decide if I'm gonna be
focused on Zahida, or this new girl.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.920
Hopefully today's not
national pick on Chanelle day.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.840
So, Sean's really nice.
I'm getting the fanny tingles

22:57.920 --> 23:01.320
and if Zahida wasn't in the mix,
I'd go there.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.120
Fuck off, duck lips.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.000
I've woken up a bit upset
with how things ended with Nicole.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.440
My head's fucked
about the whole situation.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.600
I woke up this morning and went down
to the bedroom where Adam was.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.880
I jumped in under the cover,
gave him a massive cuddle, a kiss.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.120
And he just smiled.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.560
I don't wanna get mugged off,
but when you're stuck 24 seven

23:32.640 --> 23:35.960
around someone that you truly love,
it's fucking hard.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.800
Nicole got in his bed
and started kissing him,

23:43.880 --> 23:47.160
if Jacques was still here,
would you fuck be in bed with him.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.840
Like, I've said to him,
"You ain't second best, bruv."

24:05.840 --> 24:07.320
'Factor 50 at the ready,

24:07.400 --> 24:10.240
the Tablet of Terror has sent
everyone to the beach.'

24:10.320 --> 24:11.720
Beach party!

24:17.960 --> 24:20.240
Fucking loving life!

24:24.640 --> 24:27.520
Alcohol and beaches
makes everyone fucking smile.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.760
So, anyway, boys,
what is the fucking crackage?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.360
Yous and Nicole?

24:38.440 --> 24:39.960
She wants to get back with me.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.680
She's jumping in my bed
in the morning, kissing me.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.800
Like, and I'm falling into it, yeah.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.440
I feel like Nicole is stringing
Adam along. It's not fair.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.640
It's not fair on Adam.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.920
She knows she fucked up, cos she
found out I'm a better person.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.280
and now she's trying to make up.
How do you feel about her?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.760
She was my first
ever girlfriend, yeah?

24:59.840 --> 25:03.280
The first girl that met my mum,
the first girl that slept in my bed.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.080
I love her. I'm not gonna lie.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.040
Fuck knows what's going on.
The girl is playing mind games.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.080
What's going on with you and Bec?

25:11.160 --> 25:15.080
As far as I'm concerned, if I wanna
have sex with someone, I will.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.720
Who would you pick?Frankie.
When we talk I'm like, "Phwoar."

25:22.640 --> 25:26.920
Frankie!
(laughter)

25:27.000 --> 25:30.720
Get your kecks off!
(laughter)

25:30.800 --> 25:34.520
I've been in here a long time and
my balls are hitting my kneecaps.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.840
I'm telling you now, I'm gonna
blow her kisser straight off.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.000
'Typical boys.'

25:42.080 --> 25:44.160
'Only ever after one thing.'

25:45.240 --> 25:46.720
'Not like the girls.'

25:46.800 --> 25:49.680
What are you guys thinking
about the boys in the villa?

25:49.760 --> 25:51.360
I'd like to get to know Aaron.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.600
If you went on a date with him
today, would something happen?

25:54.680 --> 25:57.320
I'd give him a snog.
Aaron is a good-looking guy.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.960
He's the one person I fancy.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.080
Who would you take to the penthouse?
I'd take all of them.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.880
Gangbang!

26:03.960 --> 26:05.920
You kinky bitch!

26:06.000 --> 26:07.160
(laughter)

26:07.240 --> 26:10.400
Maisie just wants to shag
anything with a fucking pulse.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.400
I mean, the local dogs
need to watch out.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.680
If you had one person to take to the
penthouse, who would it be?

26:16.760 --> 26:18.120
Sean.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.160
If I had to take one person,
it would be him.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.840
Do you reckon Sean would stray?

26:23.920 --> 26:25.040
I think he would.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.400
Once they've been in this pussy...
They don't leave you alone.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.160
They don't.
I have to get restraining orders.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.120
It's addictive!

26:34.120 --> 26:37.120
Zahida, she can fuck off
back to the fucking pond.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.760
I have no loyalties with that bitch.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.240
If you be a bitch to me,
I've got no loyalties.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.040
And I'll probably sit on his face
for that fact you've been a bitch.

26:46.120 --> 26:49.480
I'm gonna go there,
and I'm gonna fucking enjoy it.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.160
I'll even let him do anal.

26:51.240 --> 26:55.840
(laughs) Maybe she needs to be nice.
She does.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.760
And I'm not a nice girl,
I'm a fucking psycho.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.920
(laughs)

27:02.000 --> 27:03.480
(screams)

27:10.120 --> 27:11.760
(Tablet of Terror chimes)

27:11.840 --> 27:13.240
(groaning)

27:13.320 --> 27:16.320
Why does the Tablet of Terror
always have to ruin the day?

27:16.400 --> 27:19.000
"Things have been moving
at a snail pace."

27:19.080 --> 27:22.160
"Frankie and Aaron, it's time
to come out of your shell."

27:22.240 --> 27:23.320
"It's date time."

27:23.400 --> 27:25.400
(cheering)

27:25.480 --> 27:28.840
I'm excited to go on the date,
cos I haven't got to know him.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.240
I could see in Becca's face
she wasn't happy,

27:31.320 --> 27:33.200
but we'll see where it goes.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.480
Howay, Frankie.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.040
Let's get fucking pissed!

27:36.120 --> 27:39.080
I'm glad to go on a date
with Frankie, she's fucking fit.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.720
Fuck Becca, we're gonna have
a good crack and see what happens.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.080
(laughs) Your face.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.640
At least hide the face.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.320
He's not cracking on with anyone.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
I'm jealous
and I'm not gonna allow it.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.320
'That's the spirit, Becca.'

27:53.400 --> 27:55.880
'And there's plenty more
jealous psychopaths

27:55.960 --> 27:58.240
to mess with their
tiny little minds.'

27:58.320 --> 28:00.920
'Whose ex is next?

28:02.600 --> 28:06.280
'The Tablet of Terror has sent Aaron
and Frankie on a tasty date

28:06.360 --> 28:08.400
to try some local delicacies.'

28:08.480 --> 28:10.440
I've brought you...

28:12.400 --> 28:13.920
...snails.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.680
Oh, ho, yeah.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.400
It's super aphrodisiac.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.560
(laughter)

28:21.640 --> 28:23.400
Get them in your peck.
No.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.600
(laughs)

28:25.680 --> 28:28.680
Oh, that one's still alive.
(laughs)

28:28.760 --> 28:30.920
It looks like
a little fucking tadpole.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.960
(laughs)
Go.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.000
Where's the Nando's?
(laughs)

28:39.080 --> 28:40.760
I fucking fancy this girl.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.840
And by the way she's cracking on,
I think she fancies me.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.760
(laughs)

28:45.840 --> 28:48.640
I like Aaron,
he's got a good personality.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.440
But, and there's a but, Becca.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.200
Are you completely single?

28:53.280 --> 28:56.720
Howay, why do you say that?
I only said that cos of Becca.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.240
There is no me and Becca.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.840
Before I do anything with Aaron,
I would wanna speak to Becca first.

29:01.920 --> 29:05.120
If me and you get together,
I'm gonna have her screaming at me.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.160
I'd shut her down and say, "You have
got not one leg to stand on."

29:09.240 --> 29:12.080
Becca's not even here
and she's cock blocking us.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.280
Becca, do me a favour and fuck off.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.840
The minute you walked in...
It was quite hard,

29:16.920 --> 29:19.760
I was like, she is,
like, you are fit.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.560
Something in the eyes just...

29:21.640 --> 29:23.760
Look into the eyes.
It is.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.400
There's something that gets lost.
Hypnotising you.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.160
Lost...
(laughs)

29:29.240 --> 29:33.520
Them fucking titties on your chest
will be blown clean apart.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.040
(laughs)

29:41.800 --> 29:43.960
(laughter)

29:44.040 --> 29:46.440
I just wanna have
a good time and have fun.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.040
I may have slipped
a tongue in there.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.000
Sean will kiss Chanelle.

29:56.080 --> 30:00.560
Sean fancies me. He's been
staring at my tits all night.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.760
For three seconds.

30:02.840 --> 30:08.000
In three seconds, Zahida can launch
a bottle, a glass, a plant pot.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.200
Who knows?
I'm fucking shitting myself.

30:11.480 --> 30:15.320
One...
One, two...

30:15.840 --> 30:18.920
Two, two...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.560
(laughter, cheering)

30:22.440 --> 30:25.360
Woo! Shake your titties.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.840
All I wanted to do was put my hands
on her bum, grab her tit,

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
have a poke. Love it.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.320
Ahh! Look at Zahida's face.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.000
What kinda sick joke's that? She's
the only person bothering us.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.240
It's a dare.
Shut your fucking mouth.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.800
I knew what I was doing.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.000
Don't be a dick. Zahida's
kicking off cos she's jealous.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.400
She's intimidated. I've necked on
with the girl, so what?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.360
I see a dare, you see an issue.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.480
He's just humiliated us
in front of the whole table...

30:53.560 --> 30:55.640
(teary, indistinct)

30:55.720 --> 30:57.280
Not fucking funny.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.320
I don't wanna talk to Sean any more,
I just wanna go to bed.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.840
(crying)

31:15.920 --> 31:20.000
Chanelle's his type, like,
she's fucking rank compared to me.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.720
She's fucking disgusting.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.800
It makes us think, like,
do I look the same as Chanelle?

31:24.880 --> 31:26.480
Cos I really don't think I do.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.080
You don't. You're 1000 times
prettier than her.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.600
I thought when you came in,
you are beautiful.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.880
I thought I was.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.400
I love Zahida, but she will get
jealous over any little thing.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
Us girls are all the same.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.280
(indistinct squealing)
Hold on, are you garlic bread?

31:42.360 --> 31:45.440
Are you garlic bread? Answer me,
are you garlic bread?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.680
No.
Exactly. No.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.600
You're not garlic bread,
you're not a side dish, mate.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.120
Don't fucking act like one.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.560
Sort yourself out, wipe your face
and do what you gotta do.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.320
I feel like my world
is shattered once again.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.480
Don't let anyone
treat you like that.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.080
It's fucking unfair.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.480
(weeping) I feel so stupid.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.520
I wanna go and strangle Chanelle.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.680
Fucking fat cunt,
I hate her so much.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.720
She's driving us nuts!

32:16.800 --> 32:19.080
You gotta remember
this is not her fault

32:19.160 --> 32:22.240
Everything gets blamed on me.
Don't raise your voice at us.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.880
I'm not raising my voice.
Pack it in now.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.440
They're her insecurities and she
shouldn't be taking it out on me.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.520
I'm fucking upset.
Don't get cocky.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.080
I'm not getting cocky!
Course I'll get cocky!

32:33.160 --> 32:35.880
I'm upset and you come in here
having your two piece.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.000
Get the fuck out!

32:37.080 --> 32:39.280
I dislike you, don't come near us!

32:39.360 --> 32:42.080
Get out of my face now!

32:42.160 --> 32:43.200
Fuck off!

32:43.280 --> 32:46.800
I'm in between
two very, very psycho birds

32:46.880 --> 32:49.720
and, to be honest,
I'm a little bit scared.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.200
Get out! Get the fuck out!
It's a bad idea.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.800
Now!
Calm down, Z, come on.

32:55.880 --> 33:01.760
(screams)

33:08.800 --> 33:10.200
What the fuck is going on?

33:10.280 --> 33:13.200
She's not shouting at me!
You're weird!

33:13.280 --> 33:16.760
I'm not gonna fight.
I'm gonna be good.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.600
Who the fuck are you?

33:20.680 --> 33:22.920
Don't start with me,
you stupid bitch.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.080
Chanelle swills me,
who the fuck do you think you are?

33:27.160 --> 33:28.440
Get off me now!

33:28.520 --> 33:29.880
She needs to fuck off.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.440
Are you fucking joking?

33:31.520 --> 33:35.080
Come here!
Come here, you fucking moron.

33:35.160 --> 33:40.200
(shouting)

33:40.280 --> 33:43.920
The minute I get the chance to
swill her, I'm gonna fucking do it.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.640
Frankie and Aaron have been away
for an extremely long time.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.800
Let's all buzz our tits off.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.000
Oh, Becca's getting jealous.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.600
Girls in this villa are wasting
their time trying to get with Aaron.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.240
You ain't gonna when I'm here.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.560
(whistles)

34:00.640 --> 34:03.240
(cheering)

34:03.320 --> 34:05.160
Look at Becca's fucking face.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.800
She is fucking fuming.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.159
When you kissed,
did you use tongues?

34:09.239 --> 34:10.239
Definitely not.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.880
But you did peck?
(mimics) But you did peck.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.280
The fact Becca
is twisting her fucking face

34:15.360 --> 34:17.320
and making stupid noises
says it all.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.199
The girl is a fucking idiot.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.760
So, went to a French restaurant,
we ate snails.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.280
What did you get the snail and go...

34:28.560 --> 34:31.320
We're not fucking talking about you!

34:31.400 --> 34:33.800
Becca, fuck off.

34:33.880 --> 34:38.400
Do yous fancy each other?
Far as I'm concerned, I fancy her.

34:38.480 --> 34:43.040
She's saying she doesn't care,
but she does look kind of upset.

34:43.120 --> 34:46.199
Until things are cleared completely
between them two...

34:46.280 --> 34:48.760
Aaron, is it one of them?
Is it one of them?

34:48.840 --> 34:51.159
Becca always cock blocks Aaron.

34:51.239 --> 34:54.400
If Frankie wants to bang Aaron,
she should get on with it.

34:54.480 --> 34:58.160
My first question to him was,
"What is your feelings for Becca?"

34:58.240 --> 35:00.640
Because, even though...
He hates me.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.720
After what Becca's put me through,

35:02.800 --> 35:05.000
do you think
I give a fuck what she thinks?

35:05.080 --> 35:07.560
No. Do I fuck.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.400
'Maybe it's not Becca
you should worry about,

35:10.480 --> 35:15.960
as more exes are on their way
to make your lives a misery.'

35:16.040 --> 35:18.240
'Whose ex is next?'

35:18.320 --> 35:19.920
(evil laugh)

35:27.640 --> 35:32.640
I have to admit, I'm a bit jealous
that Aaron and Frankie kissed.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.880
I've made sure
I've marked my territory with Aaron.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.360
Frankie, can you smell that?
That's my piss.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.440
I'm not here to upset people.

35:51.520 --> 35:55.280
If someone loves someone,
that's deeper than me liking them.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.160
I feel it's safe to say
Frankie wouldn't go there,

36:00.240 --> 36:01.960
but who knows in this villa?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.320
Living with your ex is a nightmare.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.720
You get cock blocked
left, right and fucking centre.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.320
I'm fucked off.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.800
I told Zahida from day one
to keep her feelings compressed,

36:18.880 --> 36:21.320
cos it ain't ever
gonna work outside of here.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.600
You're getting too many feelings,
you're getting too attached. You are.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.320
I don't wanna be alone in the villa.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.320
All I care about is being with Sean.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.000
It's pissing me off,
cos you stop me doing things.

36:35.080 --> 36:38.360
You wanna hug and kiss, but the more
we hug and kiss, the more...

36:39.480 --> 36:41.880
The more you're gonna get upset, Z.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.240
Go then.
I don't wanna fucking hurt ya.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.560
Well, good job.
Good job?Yeah. good job.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.520
So, you're blaming me, yeah?
Fuck off! I don't wanna talk.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.000
I can't help my feelings.
I'm really annoyed.

36:54.080 --> 36:58.160
And now I know me and Sean won't go
to bed together cos of Chanelle.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.560
Chanelle will probably end up
trying to sleep next to him.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.480
I hate her so much.
I wanna strangle her.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.880
Go away, please.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.240
Good job, yeah?

37:07.320 --> 37:11.000

Fuck off! Fuck off!

37:22.160 --> 37:24.160
Go away!

37:25.720 --> 37:27.040
And you've got attached!

37:27.120 --> 37:29.440
I didn't wanna hurt you,

37:29.520 --> 37:31.520

37:31.600 --> 37:34.680

37:40.400 --> 37:42.760
Why are you fucking here? Go away!

37:44.040 --> 37:46.360
I'm not having no-one
come in my face.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.040
I'll smash her fucking face in.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.960
Don't fucking stare at us like that.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.160

37:56.240 --> 37:58.080
Oi, oi, oi!

38:08.520 --> 38:11.240
She is a fucking disgrace.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.720
I'm fucking livid!

38:13.800 --> 38:17.040
No, get me out of here.
I've had enough of it.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
Game over.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.440
End of story. Bye-bye.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.120
My name's Chanelle McCleary,

38:26.200 --> 38:29.080
