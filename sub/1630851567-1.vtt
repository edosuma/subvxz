01:34.519 --> 01:38.183
One move over would be better.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.487
What the hell do you know?

01:43.595 --> 01:45.791
Go mop the floor, goddamn rat.

02:06.618 --> 02:08.382
Those metal junks are useless.

02:12.457 --> 02:14.653
A man lives and dies by honor.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.992
I finished cleaning.

02:17.695 --> 02:19.060
Okay, good work.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.841
Su-yeon.

02:33.244 --> 02:35.338
Didn't you say your brother
learned to play Go?

02:36.414 --> 02:40.408
Yes, dad taught him a
bit when he was young.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.152
Should I teach him here?

02:46.057 --> 02:49.789
Your service will cover his lessons.

02:51.262 --> 02:52.354
Really?

02:52.897 --> 02:55.696
Then I can clean every day.

02:57.702 --> 02:58.897
Come sit down.

03:07.212 --> 03:08.338
Sit down beside me.

03:09.547 --> 03:13.040
You need to listen
carefully about his future.

04:13.011 --> 04:13.876
What is it?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.139
Can we play a round?

04:18.783 --> 04:19.841
With me?

04:20.218 --> 04:22.050
I'd like to know how good I am.

04:34.799 --> 04:36.767
You're slow, hurry up.

04:44.976 --> 04:46.535
Too slow, faster!

04:51.149 --> 04:51.980
Faster!

04:53.451 --> 04:54.384
Hurry!

04:54.853 --> 04:55.979
Play faster!

05:07.065 --> 05:08.089
Remove your hand.

05:10.034 --> 05:12.093
Do not linger in the face of death.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.973
Unfortunately, you've got no talent.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.676
Don't bet your future on Go.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.072
Go home.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.578
You feel wronged?

05:30.889 --> 05:32.755
Come back when you feel confident.

06:30.582 --> 06:31.515
Seoul.

06:40.391 --> 06:41.654
Gonna buy a ticket?

06:42.827 --> 06:43.953
It's almost the last bus.

06:44.629 --> 06:46.529
Furthest place from here.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.066
North or South?

Not even enough for a game of pool.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.775
<i>Go Club 88</i>

07:40.952 --> 07:42.681
Thank you.

07:49.794 --> 07:51.353
- Sir?
- Yeah?

07:51.830 --> 07:54.458
Can we play a round?

08:03.775 --> 08:04.799
For 10 cents?

08:07.712 --> 08:09.043
Whose boy is he?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.495
You're good, you really are.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.300
10 cents.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.504
Kiddo, play with me.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.316
That's incredible!

09:44.509 --> 09:46.921
Ma'am, chicken gizzard and eel please.

09:46.945 --> 09:47.810
Sure thing.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.279
Country boy, new to Seoul?

09:54.385 --> 09:58.344
Careful, swindlers are everywhere.

10:07.031 --> 10:09.090
The world will be one
of two things to you:

10:09.634 --> 10:13.229
a playground or a living hell.

10:14.038 --> 10:16.598
Usually ends in hell though.

10:20.145 --> 10:22.978
Do you have a place to sleep?

10:28.686 --> 10:31.587
If it's tails, I'll come with you.

10:54.045 --> 10:55.706
It's not meant to be.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.014
I don't believe in luck.

11:03.721 --> 11:05.189
I never had any.

11:10.395 --> 11:12.363
Been a while, boss!

11:12.464 --> 11:16.298
Don't you ever die?
You come by every year.

11:17.869 --> 11:20.600
You really have your way with words.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.667
Buddy, greet him.

11:24.342 --> 11:28.108
He's the best Go player
I never got to beat.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.844
So, does he look useful?

11:36.287 --> 11:38.312
They've always looked useful.

11:38.957 --> 11:41.085
It's the teacher that's the problem.

11:44.963 --> 11:47.193
Chip in, if you feel it.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.267
Get out of it, while
you still got a hand.

11:56.107 --> 11:58.872
Could you sell unexpired
goods for once?

11:59.277 --> 12:01.837
No wonder the prayers don't work.

12:21.499 --> 12:25.163
God of Mountain, your
worthless servant is back.

12:25.503 --> 12:29.303
I pray with everything I got,
please grant me a wish.

12:38.283 --> 12:39.944
See those cairns?

12:41.052 --> 12:44.955
After every game, stack a stone.

12:49.494 --> 12:52.106
You got 5 seconds,
memorize it and draw it.

12:52.130 --> 12:52.940
5 seconds?

12:52.964 --> 12:56.161
One, two, three, four, five, over.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.267
Wait a minute!

13:15.653 --> 13:17.348
Overthinking leads to a bad move.

13:18.823 --> 13:19.813
Bad habit.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.945
One, two, three,

13:30.969 --> 13:33.336
four, five, over.

14:06.738 --> 14:09.139
Remember, play in your head.

14:09.707 --> 14:11.266
Close your eyes, and play.

14:15.413 --> 14:16.938
You can't come out until you win.

14:21.786 --> 14:23.550
If you want to give
up, ring this bell.

14:31.596 --> 14:32.927
Upper right star point.

14:33.264 --> 14:34.390
Lower left star point.

How could you miss the bait? Again!

14:55.787 --> 14:56.982
Upper right star point.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.218
Didn't you see the stairs?!

15:00.358 --> 15:01.257

15:01.559 --> 15:02.549
Again! Again!

15:03.128 --> 15:05.392

15:10.502 --> 15:12.095
Don't bet your future on Go.

15:20.278 --> 15:21.507
I'll come back tomorrow.

16:07.158 --> 16:08.353

17:27.705 --> 17:29.298
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

17:41.119 --> 17:42.177
Do you...

17:44.322 --> 17:45.721
accept promissory note?

17:58.203 --> 17:59.898
Why did you hesitate?

18:00.138 --> 18:01.606
Does playing for real
make you regret it?

18:01.706 --> 18:04.869
I think you should
give the money back...

18:05.343 --> 18:06.970
He didn't feel like a bad man.

18:08.379 --> 18:12.475
Found your playground
already? I'm the bad guy!

18:12.884 --> 18:15.114
So all my opponents are bad guys too!

18:15.253 --> 18:18.018
You'll become one soon, you hear me?

18:25.964 --> 18:27.523
Don't ever hesitate.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.464
I make all the shots!

18:31.403 --> 18:33.132
You just calculate!

18:33.571 --> 18:35.665
Become a machine that just calculates!

19:04.636 --> 19:05.660
Dad!

19:09.707 --> 19:11.072
Dad!

19:14.712 --> 19:16.680
Dad!

19:19.451 --> 19:20.247
Nice!

19:20.585 --> 19:22.280
One more, one more!

19:25.990 --> 19:27.856
So nasty...

19:29.260 --> 19:30.557
Weed.

19:31.796 --> 19:32.888
Been a while.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.429
You should switch to whiskey.

19:59.424 --> 20:03.827
I quit drinking, asshole.

20:10.568 --> 20:14.300
It'd be faster for weed to
become a medicinal herb.

20:16.641 --> 20:19.906
Too much useless talk, let's play.

20:37.929 --> 20:39.328
Double the pot.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.183
6-5, then extend, and another.

20:58.283 --> 20:59.478
Knight jump.

21:00.452 --> 21:01.419
Atari.

21:22.073 --> 21:26.510
I hear you lost your
hand to the Shaman.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.345
Became a boar's lunch.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.613
Even almighty Hur
Il-do got conned by him.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.387
Such a shame!

21:37.956 --> 21:39.151
Too bad though,

21:39.924 --> 21:45.363
you'll lose that remaining hand too.

21:45.797 --> 21:47.390
One's fate is a mystery.

21:47.999 --> 21:52.869
Who knows, you might
lose your head first.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.370
Use that knife on your eyes.

22:27.672 --> 22:29.140
Or you won't live long.

22:29.674 --> 22:32.837
You got good since the
last time I saw you.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.172
What's the secret?

22:39.284 --> 22:40.251
Prayer.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.561
Keep it with you, it's your cut.

22:58.703 --> 23:00.281
If you're ever on your own,

23:00.305 --> 23:02.273
look for a guy named Turd
in Gwancheol district.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.769
He's useless, but he
sticks around like a turd.

23:07.045 --> 23:08.012
This way.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.268
I told you to put that
knife on your eyes.

23:36.274 --> 23:37.207
Run, you idiot!

23:42.380 --> 23:43.643
Run!

24:09.874 --> 24:12.536
Boy! It's dark, be careful!

24:14.279 --> 24:17.909
I knew something was up,
but I didn't think it'd be a kid.

24:18.450 --> 24:19.781
Let me apologize,

24:20.051 --> 24:21.280
what choice do I have?

24:23.321 --> 24:24.948
If I don't cut the sprout now,

24:27.058 --> 24:29.720
I'll need an axe later, no?

Don't look too far.

When you set your mind
to it, that's your playground.

I only facilitate the game,

rigged, our business is over.

29:32.063 --> 29:33.707

Yes, Cutlassfish's a bit much.

30:10.402 --> 30:12.370
Yes, I understand.

30:14.672 --> 30:17.607
Do serpents poop?

30:19.544 --> 30:20.602
They serpently do!

30:27.385 --> 30:28.409
It's not funny?

30:31.990 --> 30:33.480

Madame Hong.

I heard about a turd

31:38.523 --> 31:39.991
What's taking so long?

31:48.733 --> 31:49.825
I hope you're not mad.

32:12.624 --> 32:13.887
Thank you, take care!

32:16.227 --> 32:17.251
Hello?

32:17.829 --> 32:19.319
Madame Hong.

32:19.631 --> 32:24.091
If the business is
bad, just get rid of it.

32:24.202 --> 32:27.069
Sounds like you made
a boat load of money.

32:27.205 --> 32:31.403
One can make money at any time.

32:33.545 --> 32:36.590
If you want something, just tell me.

32:36.614 --> 32:39.845
Since you took my shit
car, bring back a new one.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.415
Hello? Hello?

32:48.993 --> 32:50.791
One for you, one for me.

32:51.663 --> 32:55.861
Let's do 2 tours like this
and buy up 2 buildings,

32:56.467 --> 32:57.764
Very nice!

32:59.738 --> 33:01.832
Don't you want to see
how I split our shares?

33:03.808 --> 33:05.708
You don't need to,
I'll be very precise.

33:06.845 --> 33:09.314
One for you, one for me.

33:10.181 --> 33:12.240
One for you, one for me.

33:14.352 --> 33:16.252
How did you know Mr. Hur?

33:17.722 --> 33:19.486
Disrespectful ass...

33:27.265 --> 33:28.892
You and I need to talk.

33:37.041 --> 33:42.104
I kept thinking about
this ever since we met.

33:43.047 --> 33:46.449
Have you never had a
job before meeting me?

33:47.819 --> 33:50.914
You speak very disrespectfully.

33:51.256 --> 33:54.590
"Sir, when did you
first meet Mr. Hur?"

33:54.726 --> 33:57.127
You gotta ask like that.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.964
'Life is Go, '

34:02.867 --> 34:06.013
you must become a man
first in order to play well,

34:06.037 --> 34:07.505
that's what I think.

34:07.605 --> 34:11.132
I don't need that money,
keep them all.

34:14.245 --> 34:15.735
I see, that's fine.

34:17.749 --> 34:20.309
Being a man is good.

34:21.553 --> 34:23.385
Now that we had fun, let's get started.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.320
Hwang Duk-yong?

34:30.729 --> 34:32.094
You'll play a pro?

34:34.165 --> 34:35.599
Got a few stops before Hwang.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.865
Where?

34:37.335 --> 34:40.498
Jangseong, then Busan.

34:44.642 --> 34:47.942
What's wrong with this thing?

34:48.179 --> 34:50.477
Even the van knows we
aren't supposed to be here.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.407
Everyone knows.

34:54.452 --> 34:56.216
Let's not go there.

35:00.358 --> 35:02.703
Then go alone this time.

35:02.727 --> 35:04.161
I'll stay here and fix the car.

35:07.298 --> 35:09.926
Hey, why are you taking that?

35:10.268 --> 35:11.463
Hey! Leave that!

35:11.603 --> 35:13.128
Come on...

35:18.343 --> 35:21.870
I'll carry that, allow me.

35:49.474 --> 35:52.307
I don't think anyone's
here, let's just leave.

36:08.093 --> 36:10.721
I'm here for fortune
telling, is that possible?

36:20.071 --> 36:21.698
You don't need a reading.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.666
Fortune telling is for
those who want to live.

36:26.544 --> 36:28.911
If you're here for
the hand, then take it.

36:30.148 --> 36:31.582
It's beside him.

36:47.932 --> 36:49.730
Is it by divination?

36:58.576 --> 36:59.566
Yes.

37:01.012 --> 37:03.276
I don't accept money for my reading.

37:07.819 --> 37:09.480
- You there.
- Yes?

37:10.321 --> 37:12.983
You have a long life
for someone so useless.

37:14.092 --> 37:15.651
Thank your ancestors.

37:17.262 --> 37:18.991
Yes... I...

37:20.565 --> 37:23.227
hold memorial services quite regularly.

37:57.736 --> 37:59.704
The loser cuts his own hand off.

38:21.292 --> 38:26.230
<i>Bewilderment: Do Not Listen Nor Trust</i>

38:29.934 --> 38:32.995
No back support, I better go smoke.

38:33.238 --> 38:34.137
Sit.

38:50.155 --> 38:53.591
That's bad luck...

39:05.437 --> 39:07.098
Don't be territorial.

39:07.238 --> 39:09.798
We're meant to be vagabonds.

39:10.809 --> 39:12.402
So don't try to protect it.

39:17.716 --> 39:20.344
You better not lift your
head from here on.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.919
You'll die if you get lost.

39:23.455 --> 39:25.787
Everyone lost their
way in a split second.

39:48.813 --> 39:50.611
Your wife who ran away,

39:51.349 --> 39:53.010
she died recently.

39:54.285 --> 39:56.652
Merely a stone that was meant to die.

39:58.523 --> 40:00.389
At least your daughter's alive.

40:01.226 --> 40:03.854
Your wife died with a lot of guilt.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.221
Because she had your brother's child?

40:10.035 --> 40:12.970
Don't try to bait me,
I was an only son.

40:13.571 --> 40:18.338
Even so, there was no need
to kill your own brother.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.446
I told you not to lift your head.

40:28.053 --> 40:29.646
You'll get lost.

40:34.025 --> 40:37.518
Mother ran off, father
committed suicide,

40:38.163 --> 40:41.098
you had no one except
your sister to rely on.

40:41.199 --> 40:44.134
<i>Keep your ears shut,
do not listen to him.</i>

40:44.602 --> 40:45.933
<i>Don't lift your head either.</i>

40:46.237 --> 40:47.500
<i>I finished cleaning.</i>

40:47.872 --> 40:51.866
<i>Your service will cover
his lessons here.</i>

40:53.311 --> 40:54.437
<i>Really?</i>

40:56.214 --> 40:57.409
Come sit down.

41:05.824 --> 41:07.019
Sit down beside me.

41:08.059 --> 41:11.495
You need to listen
carefully about his future.

41:27.045 --> 41:28.171
Su-yeon.

41:31.883 --> 41:32.975
<i>Pity.</i>

41:33.652 --> 41:37.680
If it wasn't for that, she
could've had a happy life.

42:12.223 --> 42:13.213
What are you doing?

42:13.725 --> 42:16.592
Don't do this, please stop!

42:16.961 --> 42:21.956
What should we do with
such a young soul?

42:25.937 --> 42:28.065
Can we play a round?

42:35.280 --> 42:37.544
Do not linger in the face of death.

42:39.784 --> 42:41.878
Come back when you feel confident.

42:42.654 --> 42:46.284
<i>It was not a fate to look back on.</i>

42:57.369 --> 43:01.806
Sis, my tooth really hurts.

43:06.911 --> 43:10.848
"Don't hold in the
pain, just take a pill."

43:27.399 --> 43:29.458
<i>Su-yeon!</i>

43:36.274 --> 43:38.606
<i>Why did you abandon me?</i>

43:43.014 --> 43:44.743
<i>What were you going to do in Seoul?</i>

43:48.753 --> 43:50.949
The devil who killed her,

43:52.924 --> 43:57.225
if you kill him, your
life ends there too.

44:03.234 --> 44:05.430
I told you not to lift your head,

44:06.071 --> 44:07.561
you'll get lost.

44:16.848 --> 44:18.043
Your turn.

44:20.852 --> 44:23.549
Staring at me won't
reveal your next move.

44:23.655 --> 44:26.886
But I want to remember you.

44:43.241 --> 44:47.235
Kiddo, don't do that!

44:48.346 --> 44:51.281
If you keep up, your
brother will die too!

44:58.223 --> 44:59.384
Checkmate.

45:03.828 --> 45:06.320
How can anyone tell who won like that?

45:07.031 --> 45:09.159
Can a shaman foresee his own fate?

45:13.371 --> 45:14.896
Of course not.

45:16.408 --> 45:18.740
But I can see one thing clearly.

45:19.744 --> 45:22.338
Should I tell you your future?

45:23.548 --> 45:28.952
You strive to be a god, but
you're fated to be a monster!

45:45.203 --> 45:46.693
So, did you win?

46:43.261 --> 46:45.923
Are you lost?

46:46.798 --> 46:49.130
If you are, I'd like
to ask you to leave.

46:52.937 --> 46:55.133
I'm looking for the one-hand man,

46:55.573 --> 46:56.768
could you tell me?

46:57.308 --> 46:59.709
I don't know, please leave.

47:11.156 --> 47:12.419
I'll ask again.

47:12.991 --> 47:16.154
A man without a hand.

47:16.594 --> 47:20.224
Dead, a long time ago.

47:24.102 --> 47:25.729
What about the boy?

47:27.706 --> 47:28.673
He left...

47:31.176 --> 47:32.507
He's gone...

47:36.081 --> 47:37.981
Don't worry, you won't die like this.

47:41.353 --> 47:46.434
I gamble for life, I gotta
give you a chance.

48:10.715 --> 48:12.979

48:13.318 --> 48:15.650

48:43.048 --> 48:45.176
Wow, you're really good.

49:12.310 --> 49:15.803

shed tears of blood?

49:28.660 --> 49:30.128
Probably a lot, right?

49:30.862 --> 49:33.490

50:23.014 --> 50:28.043
I knew I smelled something,
you sure do live long.

50:28.319 --> 50:31.448
I think it's because I
live without any greed.

I respect you too much, I'd
much prefer to call you sir.

May I?

51:01.419 --> 51:02.614

51:21.506 --> 51:26.774
Yes, he may not look like much,

51:26.912 --> 51:30.007
but he made big bucks
with his business...

51:30.615 --> 51:33.846
and he goes crazy over betting Go.

52:20.632 --> 52:21.497

52:22.567 --> 52:25.179
We agreed to play, but I
don't know if we should.

52:25.203 --> 52:27.831
He plays really dirty.

lose again, double
again, then double that.

52:40.485 --> 52:41.884
Just gotta keep winning.

1:01:34.552 --> 1:01:37.544
When I was young, I
loved riding on the train.

1:01:38.957 --> 1:01:44.623
After passing through a dark tunnel,
I thought I'd live in a big house.

1:01:45.564 --> 1:01:51.128
But that fucking tunnel was too long.

1:01:51.836 --> 1:01:53.497
It's endlessly dark.

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:59.537
In the end, weeds can't survive

1:02:01.212 --> 1:02:02.577
in the long dark tunnel.

1:02:22.834 --> 1:02:23.767
Checkmate.

1:02:26.471 --> 1:02:29.065
It can't be, I must've
calculated wrong.

1:02:29.474 --> 1:02:31.135
Hold on, give me a second!

1:02:35.013 --> 1:02:36.208
Should I turn a blind eye?

1:02:38.183 --> 1:02:40.311
I won't tell others that
you begged for your life.

1:02:50.061 --> 1:02:51.620
If you're afraid, just say so.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:04.500
Help me!

1:03:12.984 --> 1:03:14.110
What should I do?

1:03:14.953 --> 1:03:17.115
If I don't cut the sprout
now, I'll need an axe later!

1:03:17.555 --> 1:03:19.353
What the hell, man!

1:03:22.494 --> 1:03:25.862
Help me, I'll do whatever you ask!

1:03:36.708 --> 1:03:37.573
Your hand!

1:03:43.515 --> 1:03:44.949
Shit, let it go!

1:03:45.116 --> 1:03:46.277
Remember what you just said!

1:03:46.785 --> 1:03:48.514
Let go, asshole!

1:03:49.721 --> 1:03:53.453
No, don't let go!
Don't fucking let go!

1:03:54.392 --> 1:03:57.089
It hurts!

1:03:59.597 --> 1:04:03.077
We're at round 6 of 9-dan Hwang's match

1:04:03.101 --> 1:04:05.365
against 20 pro Go players.

1:04:05.670 --> 1:04:08.901
As we speak, 5-dan
Kim Sun-ho has given up.

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:11.868
<i>Even 20 players are no match for Hwang.</i>

1:04:12.577 --> 1:04:15.547
<i>It's an incredible match.</i>

1:04:16.614 --> 1:04:19.140
He's a god now.

1:04:19.484 --> 1:04:21.362
Youngsters are dropping like flies.

1:04:21.386 --> 1:04:25.084
<i>Previous record was 9-dan
Wang against 10 professionals.</i>

1:04:25.657 --> 1:04:28.854
<i>But he failed to take the win.</i>

1:04:29.494 --> 1:04:30.586
That was great.

1:04:31.263 --> 1:04:33.129
Sir, where's the washroom?

1:04:33.632 --> 1:04:36.533
<i>We're approaching the
end of the 6th round.</i>

1:04:36.668 --> 1:04:38.534
<i>What'd the outcome be?</i>

1:04:38.903 --> 1:04:43.704
<i>Number of players is
meaningless to 9-dan Hwang.</i>

1:04:44.743 --> 1:04:45.733
Sir.

1:04:46.745 --> 1:04:48.144
Allow me to borrow this.

1:04:53.018 --> 1:04:54.816
- Give me your scarf.
- You wanna try it too?

1:05:01.126 --> 1:05:03.959
What are you doing? That's expensive!

1:05:04.295 --> 1:05:05.285
That shouldn't get wet!

1:05:57.048 --> 1:05:58.209
Hey! Watch out!

1:07:24.169 --> 1:07:25.102
Come on out.

1:07:25.704 --> 1:07:26.830
I'll help you!

1:07:27.405 --> 1:07:29.134
You sons of bitches!

1:08:04.676 --> 1:08:07.543
Mr. Turd, you're still alive!

1:08:08.213 --> 1:08:11.258
I ran to avoid the
rain, but it got wet.

1:08:11.282 --> 1:08:12.443
What's that?

1:08:12.984 --> 1:08:14.713
It's your birthday.

1:08:16.921 --> 1:08:20.221
You can't see one move ahead,
yet you remembered my birthday?

1:08:22.427 --> 1:08:24.521
I remember everything.

1:08:31.803 --> 1:08:34.204
What? Got something to say?

1:08:35.774 --> 1:08:36.764
Madame Hong.

1:08:37.742 --> 1:08:45.308
I've had several near-death
experiences lately,

1:08:45.450 --> 1:08:47.817
and came to a realization.

1:08:48.353 --> 1:08:49.548
What's that?

1:08:50.188 --> 1:08:51.656
In life...

1:08:53.291 --> 1:08:55.851
If there is a divine move...

1:08:58.630 --> 1:08:59.756
you'd be it...

1:09:02.734 --> 1:09:04.532
It's too sudden.

1:09:05.370 --> 1:09:07.648
Don't take me for an easy gal.

1:09:07.672 --> 1:09:08.969
Madame Hong, how about this?

1:09:09.407 --> 1:09:12.377
Let's play a round of Go,

1:09:12.444 --> 1:09:16.074
the winner gets a wish.

1:09:17.015 --> 1:09:18.073
So?

1:09:19.751 --> 1:09:21.549
You play well.

1:09:22.754 --> 1:09:26.418
I can't lose even if I try.

1:09:28.059 --> 1:09:31.051
Look at the big picture.

1:09:31.396 --> 1:09:34.696
And place stones with confidence!

1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.000
How long will you live so spinelessly?

1:09:37.235 --> 1:09:38.532
Well, the thing is...

1:09:38.937 --> 1:09:41.872
I was going to do that...

1:09:42.941 --> 1:09:44.340
Play again?

1:09:44.809 --> 1:09:48.541
I'd really appreciate that.

1:09:49.247 --> 1:09:50.612
I'll give you 2 handicaps.

1:09:51.216 --> 1:09:53.241
I still got my pride as a man...

1:09:53.451 --> 1:09:54.543
Baby!

1:09:55.387 --> 1:09:58.288
Do you want to die lonely?

1:10:02.928 --> 1:10:04.293
Would you be okay...

1:10:06.365 --> 1:10:07.696
with 2 handicaps?

1:10:10.235 --> 1:10:13.000
<i>Hwang Duk-yong Go Foundation</i>

1:10:13.405 --> 1:10:16.864
<i>Book Release Signing Event</i>

1:10:23.615 --> 1:10:24.912
Thank you.

1:10:25.250 --> 1:10:26.718
Thank you!

1:10:27.252 --> 1:10:28.219
So heavy!

1:10:32.157 --> 1:10:34.216
I waited 3 hours in line.

1:10:34.426 --> 1:10:36.258
I'm sorry about that.

1:10:36.661 --> 1:10:38.322
"The Board Encapsulates the World."

1:10:39.097 --> 1:10:40.997
So you want to swallow
the world whole, eh?

1:10:41.099 --> 1:10:42.794
You're being rude.

1:10:43.802 --> 1:10:46.999
My apologies, may I shake your hand?

1:10:47.105 --> 1:10:49.233
Give me your book,
I'll sign it for you.

1:10:51.009 --> 1:10:53.808
I don't really need an autograph.

1:10:55.180 --> 1:10:58.673
Could we take a selfie? I
gotta send it somewhere.

1:10:58.817 --> 1:10:59.660
- Smile!
- What are you doing?

1:10:59.684 --> 1:11:00.412
Security!

1:11:00.485 --> 1:11:03.798
You're 2-dan Hwang Sun-hee!

1:11:03.822 --> 1:11:05.654
The hottie pro player!

1:11:05.757 --> 1:11:07.953
Your skin is incredible!

1:11:08.193 --> 1:11:09.388
Yes, ma'am.

1:11:09.995 --> 1:11:12.123
Could you get rid of someone like him?

1:11:12.764 --> 1:11:15.529
- This way.
- Wait a minute!

1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:16.665
Let go!

1:11:17.669 --> 1:11:19.569
You're being rude to your fan.

1:11:20.172 --> 1:11:23.972
Please leave, and
take what you brought.

1:11:24.709 --> 1:11:26.768
We don't accept these things.

1:11:59.711 --> 1:12:00.473
Sir.

1:12:02.447 --> 1:12:03.846
It's 5 minutes before the second half.

1:12:07.319 --> 1:12:08.445
He's coming out.

1:12:20.899 --> 1:12:24.426
<i>Passage: Path out of Strife</i>

1:12:25.003 --> 1:12:26.596
Congrats on your event, Mr. Hwang.

1:12:27.739 --> 1:12:28.968
Who are you?

1:12:31.243 --> 1:12:32.677
You must've forgotten.

1:12:34.746 --> 1:12:37.306
You said to come
back if I felt wronged.

1:12:38.550 --> 1:12:40.416
I do not remember, please leave.

1:12:49.995 --> 1:12:51.827
This was for cleaning your desk,

1:12:54.232 --> 1:12:55.961
this was for cleaning the window.

1:12:59.070 --> 1:13:00.731
This was for the floor.

1:13:01.973 --> 1:13:06.843
I wanted to return them right
away, but it took too long.

1:13:07.579 --> 1:13:08.671
Who are you?

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:10.507
A boy with no talent.

1:13:18.156 --> 1:13:20.454
That crybaby?

1:13:24.296 --> 1:13:29.735
Your daughter grew up
well, smart and pretty.

1:13:38.710 --> 1:13:39.802
Check it.

1:13:45.817 --> 1:13:46.784
Answer.

1:13:54.926 --> 1:13:55.757
Dad!

1:13:56.194 --> 1:13:57.161
Sun-hee...

1:13:59.998 --> 1:14:01.727
Here are the rules.

1:14:02.634 --> 1:14:06.298
One single match,
the title is your life.

1:14:06.638 --> 1:14:09.733
If you refuse, your daughter dies.

1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:30.259
Have you gotten good?

1:14:31.830 --> 1:14:35.789
But a hundred of you
are still no match for me.

1:14:37.435 --> 1:14:39.733
Don't waste my time.

1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:43.303
I'll change the rule.

1:14:44.810 --> 1:14:46.539
I'll play against a hundred of you.

1:14:47.445 --> 1:14:49.709
Tomorrow at noon, right here.

1:14:50.549 --> 1:14:52.142
If no one beats me,

1:14:54.853 --> 1:14:55.911
she's dead.

1:15:08.066 --> 1:15:11.092
Go buy a bed.

1:15:13.171 --> 1:15:15.663
Use this and this to buy a table.

1:15:16.308 --> 1:15:20.575
Take this much and
go buy a sports car.

1:15:23.748 --> 1:15:24.874
A red one.

1:15:38.163 --> 1:15:41.224
My tummy, what a timing.

1:15:43.935 --> 1:15:44.902
Holy cow!

1:15:47.272 --> 1:15:48.706
Don't worry, you won't die.

1:15:50.108 --> 1:15:52.338
You'll need two things:

1:15:52.677 --> 1:15:53.610
patience,

1:15:54.913 --> 1:15:56.813
and someone to save you.

1:16:00.419 --> 1:16:05.118
I'll call you my master!

1:16:06.224 --> 1:16:09.125
I'll serve you from here on!

1:16:10.629 --> 1:16:13.963
I'll do whatever you ask!

1:16:26.678 --> 1:16:31.172
If you need money, you can take mine!

1:16:31.316 --> 1:16:32.715
Please!

1:16:37.822 --> 1:16:41.053
Master, I...

1:16:42.293 --> 1:16:47.163
I was born in winter, I
don't do well with heat...

1:16:52.170 --> 1:16:57.574
Please save me... Get me out of here...

1:17:02.580 --> 1:17:04.207
Dad!

1:17:07.085 --> 1:17:08.678
Save me!

1:17:15.393 --> 1:17:16.519
Do you remember me?

1:17:16.661 --> 1:17:20.529
It must be my turn to avenge my dad.

1:17:23.602 --> 1:17:24.694
Don't worry.

1:17:25.837 --> 1:17:28.534
He'll be okay while we play.

1:17:33.879 --> 1:17:35.074
Shall we get started?

1:17:36.715 --> 1:17:38.012
I'll apologize if you want.

1:17:40.018 --> 1:17:41.213
No, it's okay.

1:17:45.690 --> 1:17:47.488
I just want exact revenge.

1:17:50.762 --> 1:17:57.031
If you don't like hot things,
keep adding dead stones, okay?

1:17:57.535 --> 1:17:59.765
Let's begin.

1:18:44.349 --> 1:18:45.316
Too hot?

1:18:46.851 --> 1:18:48.376
You must've lived in a cold place.

1:18:50.655 --> 1:18:52.623
It wasn't that cold.

1:18:55.727 --> 1:18:57.024
Just lonely.

1:19:00.098 --> 1:19:04.501
I recall that lonely place
had a corner store owner.

1:19:09.507 --> 1:19:11.839
You'll meet them all in hell.

1:19:25.424 --> 1:19:28.155
Play faster...

1:20:00.025 --> 1:20:03.552
I got one left, this should be good.

1:20:26.951 --> 1:20:30.319
No, it can't...

1:20:30.989 --> 1:20:33.219
Can't be...

1:20:33.725 --> 1:20:37.605
No, this isn't right...

1:20:37.629 --> 1:20:40.963
This can't be, how could it be a draw?

1:20:45.937 --> 1:20:51.171
I want the world to boil.

1:23:01.506 --> 1:23:02.598
That's enough.

1:23:08.947 --> 1:23:10.381
Let's stop this...

1:24:38.970 --> 1:24:40.301
Let's not go.

1:24:40.806 --> 1:24:41.739
I have to go.

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:45.010
We won't make it in time.

1:24:45.544 --> 1:24:47.376
And my body is...

1:24:55.854 --> 1:24:57.618
Shit, you're worse.

1:25:02.394 --> 1:25:04.761
Let me ask you one thing.

1:25:05.230 --> 1:25:08.530
<i>Why do you have to go this far?</i>

1:25:14.306 --> 1:25:17.276
Master, why are you
putting on this event for him?

1:25:17.743 --> 1:25:18.835
Who is he?

1:25:18.910 --> 1:25:22.312
Do not ask questions, just focus.

1:25:23.915 --> 1:25:25.747
Don't lose to an amateur.

1:25:51.776 --> 1:25:57.306
As we're all busy, we'll
play 10 turns per board.

1:25:57.549 --> 1:25:58.573
We'll begin right away.

1:25:58.850 --> 1:26:01.342
<i>Doomed: 1 vs. 100</i>

1:26:23.108 --> 1:26:24.075
Be quiet.

1:26:25.276 --> 1:26:26.402
Shut it!

1:27:10.522 --> 1:27:13.253
9-dan Hwang Vs. Ghost Fucker.

1:27:15.126 --> 1:27:16.525
Stupid bastard.

1:27:17.696 --> 1:27:21.394
Now, let's cheer for your dad.

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:24.360
That way, you'll get to
live and I won't see blood.

1:27:25.670 --> 1:27:26.728
You know what though?

1:27:27.439 --> 1:27:29.203
I'll tell you one thing,

1:27:30.809 --> 1:27:32.299
if I was betting my life,

1:27:35.313 --> 1:27:36.712
I'd bet on this asshole.

1:27:39.384 --> 1:27:41.284
This bastard's not human.

1:27:59.938 --> 1:28:01.633
<i>You've already found your playground.</i>

1:28:01.907 --> 1:28:03.204
<i>I'm the bad guy!</i>

1:28:03.808 --> 1:28:06.470
<i>You'll become one soon, you hear me?</i>

1:28:11.917 --> 1:28:13.407
<i>Don't ever hesitate.</i>

1:28:15.053 --> 1:28:16.782
<i>You just calculate!</i>

1:28:17.355 --> 1:28:19.517
Become a machine that just calculates!

1:28:21.393 --> 1:28:24.385
<i>I'm sorry, I'll take that back.</i>

1:28:25.630 --> 1:28:28.759
You still need to become a man first.

1:28:30.502 --> 1:28:33.597
I'll just become a machine.

1:28:57.762 --> 1:28:58.957
The match begins.

1:28:59.965 --> 1:29:02.525
4-4, 16-17.

1:29:02.767 --> 1:29:05.293
Knightjump, yeah.

1:29:06.271 --> 1:29:07.363
<i>4-17.</i>

1:29:07.806 --> 1:29:08.739
6-3.

1:29:09.608 --> 1:29:12.771
4-15, 10-17.

1:29:19.651 --> 1:29:20.982
First round is over.

1:29:21.186 --> 1:29:21.948
<i>Proof photo.</i>

1:29:47.279 --> 1:29:48.405
Hurry up!

1:29:51.182 --> 1:29:53.583
A person is on the verge of death!

1:29:53.885 --> 1:29:54.716
What?!

1:29:57.889 --> 1:29:58.981
Goddammit...

1:30:54.312 --> 1:30:55.575
Thank you for your guidance.

1:31:39.457 --> 1:31:41.357
Dammit...

1:31:41.693 --> 1:31:42.637
<i>Fucked, 6-6.</i>

1:31:42.661 --> 1:31:44.026
So he made a mistake.

1:31:45.664 --> 1:31:49.931
Indeed, it's preposterous
to play against 100 players.

1:31:51.870 --> 1:31:57.274
I told you to come back
when you were confident.

1:31:59.544 --> 1:32:00.978
Don't beat yourself over it.

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:03.542
You still came so far.

1:32:13.825 --> 1:32:14.815
Faster.

1:32:18.864 --> 1:32:20.332
Faster.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:23.934
Faster!

1:33:26.865 --> 1:33:27.889
Faster.

1:33:29.868 --> 1:33:30.960
Faster.

1:33:33.572 --> 1:33:34.596
Faster.

1:33:37.976 --> 1:33:39.000
Faster.

1:34:20.919 --> 1:34:21.909
Atari.

1:34:35.667 --> 1:34:36.600
Atari.

1:34:41.106 --> 1:34:42.437
So he won.

1:34:43.541 --> 1:34:46.806
Remember this button?
Force yourself to remember.

1:34:47.946 --> 1:34:49.573
I just might forgive you.

1:34:50.615 --> 1:34:51.980
Let me ask you one thing.

1:34:53.885 --> 1:35:00.450
From the first move to
the last, did you plan it all?

1:35:00.892 --> 1:35:04.624
Last chance, try to remember.

1:35:05.297 --> 1:35:10.497
You want me to beg
for my life at this point?

1:35:14.072 --> 1:35:15.096
All right.

1:35:17.108 --> 1:35:19.975
I remember her big eyes.

1:35:26.184 --> 1:35:28.380
Do you remember what we played for?

1:35:29.654 --> 1:35:30.849
Choose.

1:35:31.256 --> 1:35:33.782
Your daughter or you, it's your choice.

1:35:34.392 --> 1:35:37.919
I'll give you the chance
to play the last stone.

1:35:44.569 --> 1:35:48.733
This is the fate of your lowlife.

1:35:51.343 --> 1:35:55.143
You don't know how and
where you'll end up dying.

1:36:12.797 --> 1:36:14.663
For your journey to hell.

1:36:16.668 --> 1:36:17.567
My back...

1:36:18.336 --> 1:36:19.667
Oh my...

1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:23.840
My back...

1:37:04.182 --> 1:37:09.177
<i>Death</i>

1:37:34.980 --> 1:37:36.277
Goddamn ghost.

1:37:40.819 --> 1:37:44.778
<i>Finality: A Lowlife's Fate</i>

1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:51.221
<i>Shin Su-yeon</i>

1:38:59.631 --> 1:39:03.659
Will you love and respect
each other for an eternity?

1:39:04.002 --> 1:39:07.267
- Yes, I will respect and love him.
- Yes, I will respect and love her.

1:39:08.673 --> 1:39:13.304
You may hold hands and say your vows.

1:39:13.578 --> 1:39:14.409
Yes.

1:39:19.484 --> 1:39:22.613
- I will accept you as my wife...
- I will accept you as my husband...

1:39:22.754 --> 1:39:26.884
I promise to love and cherish
in sickness and in health...

1:39:32.230 --> 1:39:34.631
We must play our last move here.

1:39:38.003 --> 1:39:43.271
Can I at least know your full name?

1:39:49.715 --> 1:39:50.705
All right.

1:39:53.818 --> 1:39:54.876
Go.

1:40:07.299 --> 1:40:08.858
When I see you next time,

1:40:11.669 --> 1:40:12.761
I'll call you...

1:40:13.471 --> 1:40:14.563
'Ghost Fingers'.

1:40:15.407 --> 1:40:17.705
Fingers moved by a ghost.

1:40:19.077 --> 1:40:21.478
If there's a god of
Go, he'd play like you.

1:40:22.714 --> 1:40:25.411
So? You like it?

1:40:34.659 --> 1:40:35.592
I'm off.

1:40:36.494 --> 1:40:37.188
Take care.

1:40:37.329 --> 1:40:38.262
Bye!

1:41:20.505 --> 1:41:23.167
<i>If it's tails, I'll come with you.</i>

1:41:41.326 --> 1:41:45.263

<i>Why do you have to go this far?</i>

1:42:02.781 --> 1:42:03.509

1:42:49.928 --> 1:42:51.327
That chime.

1:42:53.732 --> 1:42:55.325
Do you know why it's a fish?

1:42:57.802 --> 1:43:01.500
A fish keeps its eyes
open even in sleep.

1:43:02.774 --> 1:43:05.607
It means, "Always stay awake."

1:43:13.184 --> 1:43:16.586
Boy, the eyes of your mind.

1:43:20.292 --> 1:43:26.459
You must look at the world
and the Go board with them.
