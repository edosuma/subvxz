WEBVTT

00:03.468 --> 00:06.897
In pain, we may find
comfort, in sorrow, hope,

00:06.922 --> 00:09.415
in death, resurrection.

00:16.853 --> 00:18.574
Aim... fire!

00:20.181 --> 00:22.066
Aim... fire!

00:23.833 --> 00:25.605
They're almost finished out there, Ken.

00:25.749 --> 00:26.732
What do you want me to tell you, Jack?

00:26.756 --> 00:28.322
I can't get the damn thing open.

00:28.346 --> 00:30.498
- Stripped?
- Nah, it's catching.

00:30.541 --> 00:31.902
It's just stuck or something.

00:31.926 --> 00:33.854
When was the last time you
opened one of these things?

00:33.878 --> 00:35.786
First one we've had since
I've been with the VA.

00:35.832 --> 00:37.590
That's, like, what, a decade?

00:37.614 --> 00:39.360
Yeah. Let me try.

00:44.947 --> 00:45.947
Okay, it's moving.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.199
What's that smell?

00:58.847 --> 00:59.847
You okay?

01:59.268 --> 02:00.268
Give me a dollar!

02:00.955 --> 02:02.745
Okay. What's wrong with that one?

02:02.769 --> 02:05.309
The machine wouldn't take
it and I want a candy bar.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.745
What's wrong with that candy bar?

02:06.769 --> 02:07.880
It has nougat in it.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.192
But you hate nougat.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.520
I know!

02:10.705 --> 02:12.038
It was a mistake, McGee!

02:12.457 --> 02:13.679
Do you have a dollar?!

02:15.146 --> 02:16.855
All I have are big bills.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.970
What is nougat?

02:18.022 --> 02:19.510
It's whipped dolphin fat.

02:19.846 --> 02:22.182
No, that's the filling in Klowny Kake.

02:22.206 --> 02:23.406
That is a myth!

02:23.771 --> 02:25.937
Would someone please give me a dollar?!

02:31.683 --> 02:32.683
Sure, I got one.

02:36.195 --> 02:37.495
Thanks.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.412
God, it's like some kind
of crime to not like nougat.

02:40.436 --> 02:41.783
I don't even know what nougat is.

02:41.807 --> 02:44.307
It's a cream made from
sugar, honey and nuts.

02:44.496 --> 02:45.496
Grab your gear.

02:45.684 --> 02:49.123
Got an explosion at a Marine's
funeral in James River National.

02:49.324 --> 02:52.379
Did anyone else see what
just happened there with Abby?

02:52.637 --> 02:54.381
Yeah, she stole my dollar.

02:56.197 --> 02:57.474
Last ones to the party.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.872
It's not really a party until
the bomb squad says it is.

03:04.510 --> 03:05.510
What'd you find?

03:05.536 --> 03:06.550
We got nothing.

03:06.574 --> 03:07.552
No ordnance,

03:07.576 --> 03:09.594
no residue, no electronics,

03:09.629 --> 03:10.687
no time device,

03:10.763 --> 03:12.740
no wiring, no remote.

03:13.198 --> 03:14.420
No evidence of a bomb.

03:14.574 --> 03:15.962
Except for the explosion.

03:16.387 --> 03:18.609
We got two employees injured, both vets.

03:18.762 --> 03:19.987
They were taken to the VA

03:20.011 --> 03:21.576
with concussions and shrapnel wounds.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.582
Got names?

03:22.606 --> 03:24.576
Former Lance Corporal Lloyd Jackson,

03:24.639 --> 03:27.908
36, and PFC Kenneth Dixon, 25.

03:27.943 --> 03:29.116
Veterans keep getting younger.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.240
The kid they were burying was only 22.

03:31.264 --> 03:32.375
It's a family crypt.

03:32.576 --> 03:35.199
- Tandem?
- His grandfather was in the back slot.

03:35.263 --> 03:36.989
Still there as far as we could tell.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.013
Your men cleared?

03:38.512 --> 03:39.845
Fire readings are clean.

03:39.891 --> 03:41.864
Air's safe to breathe, not
that I would recommend it.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.888
Anything else?

03:43.201 --> 03:45.478
Yeah. You might want
to cover your shoes.

03:56.514 --> 03:57.847
That is truly appalling.

03:59.202 --> 04:01.424
"Chief Warrant Officer Mitchell Waller."

04:02.955 --> 04:05.931
Died, 1978. Should be the
one in the back of the crypt.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.566
He appears to be undisturbed.

04:07.642 --> 04:09.254
He would be the only one.

04:09.455 --> 04:12.148
This is really the most
disgusting thing I've ever seen.

04:12.172 --> 04:14.683
And believe me, that says a lot.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.120
It's like porridge.

04:16.144 --> 04:17.677
The word is "effluvium",

04:18.454 --> 04:22.136
the result of decomposing
human organs and tissue.

04:22.171 --> 04:23.216
This is people?

04:23.292 --> 04:24.745
Yes, two, I'd say,

04:24.769 --> 04:26.046
judging bye the volume.

04:26.269 --> 04:27.743
And the two skulls, of course.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.549
Mr. Palmer, we have
to recover all of this.

04:31.769 --> 04:34.546
One Wet Vac for the Soylent
Green coming right up.

04:35.205 --> 04:37.242
Somewhat claustrophobic.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
And for all eternity.

04:39.745 --> 04:41.682
Our friends here might agree with you.

04:41.706 --> 04:43.558
They obviously needed to get out.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.310
They didn't belong
there in the first place.

04:45.334 --> 04:47.183
Vents are definitely clogged.

04:47.207 --> 04:48.935
Careful, Doctor, we still haven't

04:48.959 --> 04:50.746
found traces of what
caused the explosion.

04:50.770 --> 04:54.994
If my suspicions are
correct, Officer David,

04:55.029 --> 04:56.780
the bomb is all around us.

04:57.459 --> 05:00.123
It's a phenomenon in the death industry

05:00.147 --> 05:05.417
informally referred to as
"exploding casket syndrome."

05:05.452 --> 05:07.684
Well, the floor's all yours, Duck.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.008
Thank you, Jethro.

05:09.336 --> 05:13.060
All bodies contain enzymes and bacteria.

05:13.084 --> 05:16.812
Immediately upon death, they
start to break down tissue.

05:16.836 --> 05:19.437
Yes, a body can liquefy within a week,

05:19.461 --> 05:21.497
especially if it hasn't been embalmed.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.487
It's possible that these remains

05:25.047 --> 05:26.830
were human in appearance

05:26.865 --> 05:28.685
as recently as two weeks ago.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.349
And someone dumped them in here.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.625
Yes, and in such a confined space,

05:32.649 --> 05:35.544
as the gases were given off the bodies,

05:35.986 --> 05:37.938
without any proper ventilation

05:37.962 --> 05:40.814
the crypt itself could
become a pressure cooker.

05:40.838 --> 05:42.668
The bodies were the bomb.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.939
Not our first meat puzzle, Doctor.

05:46.963 --> 05:49.062
And it certainly won't be the last.

05:49.086 --> 05:50.626
Never forget, Mr. Palmer,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.080
experience is the ultimate teacher.

05:53.588 --> 05:55.188
Corner pieces are not as reliable

05:55.212 --> 05:56.752
as the singular components.

05:56.776 --> 05:59.128
Yes, as experience has taught us.

05:59.152 --> 06:00.452
Skulls and torsos.

06:00.712 --> 06:03.497
And judging by these pelvic structures,

06:03.776 --> 06:05.836
we have a man and a woman.

06:05.938 --> 06:07.223
Yes, well, let's put Adam

06:07.261 --> 06:08.928
on the left and Eve on the right.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.554
This reminds me of a summer

06:10.578 --> 06:13.326
when I assisted at an archaeological dig

06:13.427 --> 06:14.807
in North Africa.

06:14.892 --> 06:16.792
Our team unearthed

06:16.954 --> 06:21.189
two fossilized Neanderthals
from a primitive burial mound:

06:21.240 --> 06:23.678
One man, one woman.

06:23.713 --> 06:25.555
This rib structure's fractured, Doctor.

06:25.579 --> 06:27.868
Possibly from the
force of the explosion?

06:27.892 --> 06:28.931
Oh, no, no, no.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.431
It's a clean, serrated edge.

06:30.455 --> 06:31.460
Very unlikely.

06:31.703 --> 06:34.745
Did you know that the Zulus burn

06:34.769 --> 06:38.361
all the possessions of a dear departed

06:38.419 --> 06:40.175
to ward off evil?

06:40.210 --> 06:42.147
Some tribes even throw spears

06:42.329 --> 06:46.294
and shoot arrows into the
air to kill hovering spirits.

06:46.704 --> 06:48.214
Right ulna.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.280
That evolved into the
modern military tradition

06:51.345 --> 06:53.556
of firing a volley into the air.

06:55.394 --> 06:56.514
Uh, right hand.

06:57.394 --> 06:59.618
Yes, after the death of an African king,

06:59.642 --> 07:00.642
right hand,

07:01.082 --> 07:04.371
some of his subjects used
to cut off fingers and toes.

07:04.395 --> 07:07.795
It was considered a mark of respect.

07:08.019 --> 07:09.019
Humerus.

07:10.144 --> 07:12.447
I suppose it depends
on what you find funny.

07:15.207 --> 07:16.980
Oh, right,

07:17.796 --> 07:19.386
humerus.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.207
Right hand.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.250
Didn't this happen the last time?

07:32.274 --> 07:34.519
We're gonna need another table.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.250
The mausoleum doesn't get many visitors

07:36.274 --> 07:37.809
which makes it a creative place

07:37.833 --> 07:39.309
to get rid of a few bodies,

07:39.333 --> 07:40.422
- but...
- Whoever deposited them

07:40.446 --> 07:41.661
would first have to know that a portion

07:41.685 --> 07:43.584
of Chief Waller's crypt was vacant.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.250
That would suggest an inside job.

07:45.274 --> 07:47.919
With the knowledge to
access a sealed tomb.

07:48.023 --> 07:50.441
Which would point to Jackson...

07:51.267 --> 07:52.303
or Dixon.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.422
If they hadn't practically
blown themselves up.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.665
What do you think, McGee?

07:59.275 --> 08:01.187
She definitely seemed un-Abby.

08:01.211 --> 08:02.188
Who?

08:02.212 --> 08:03.200
Abby.

08:03.224 --> 08:04.202
Abby's unhappy?

08:04.226 --> 08:05.681
No, Abby's un-Abby.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.136
I need you to focus here,

08:07.161 --> 08:08.581
okay? Pitch in?

08:09.088 --> 08:10.339
I'll talk to her when I can.

08:10.363 --> 08:11.377
Why you?

08:11.401 --> 08:12.602
Because dealing with an angry

08:12.649 --> 08:14.842
woman requires a great
deal of sensitivity.

08:15.337 --> 08:18.352
Clearly not an area
of expertise for you.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.932
Well, I don't doubt that you have

08:19.956 --> 08:21.963
more experience with angry women.

08:22.464 --> 08:24.540
Now, you see, that wasn't
very sensitive, was it?

08:24.564 --> 08:26.378
The man has one serious relationship

08:26.402 --> 08:28.065
and all of a sudden he's an expert.

08:28.089 --> 08:30.326
All right, there is one
clear-cut undeniable reason

08:30.350 --> 08:32.754
why I should be the one to talk to Abby.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.842
She owes me a dollar. Now...

08:38.150 --> 08:40.190
We ran down I. D.'s on the remains,

08:40.214 --> 08:41.902
got a hit on the woman.

08:42.003 --> 08:43.028
Classic DiNozzo.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.503
One intact fingerprint

08:45.527 --> 08:47.755
off her left hand
matches driver's license.

08:47.779 --> 08:50.504
Marilyn Torrance, age
58 of Tyson's Corner.

08:50.528 --> 08:52.860
There's no case file because

08:52.941 --> 08:55.368
her nephew and his wife
never reported her missing.

08:55.392 --> 08:57.192
They're on their way in.

08:57.216 --> 08:58.216
That it?

09:00.756 --> 09:01.744
McGee?

09:01.768 --> 09:03.116
Is there Jethro right there?

09:03.162 --> 09:04.426
Be right there, Ducky.

09:05.355 --> 09:07.106
Saved by the bell.

09:07.466 --> 09:08.946
They were dismembered

09:09.405 --> 09:13.555
by severing tendons, muscles
from ligaments at every joint.

09:13.841 --> 09:16.005
The neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip,

09:16.029 --> 09:17.255
knee, ankle,

09:18.192 --> 09:19.242
et cetera.

09:20.217 --> 09:22.259
There's very little damage
to the bones themselves,

09:22.283 --> 09:24.318
except the rib cages, they were cut.

09:24.342 --> 09:26.846
Probably using a bone saw.

09:26.907 --> 09:28.259
Were they murdered?

09:28.283 --> 09:29.818
One of them at least was.

09:29.842 --> 09:32.507
Blunt-force trauma to the female skull.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.007
A blow to the back of the head

09:34.031 --> 09:36.319
that was certainly enough
to kill a woman of her age.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.556
Fourth-rib-phase
analysis suggests

09:38.580 --> 09:39.746
that she was in her 70s.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.260
According to the DMV,
Marilyn Torrance was 58.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.508
Women lie about their age.

09:43.532 --> 09:45.122
But this is her hand.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.719
Not her head.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.572
Well, maybe that's her head.

09:48.596 --> 09:49.760
That's a man's skull.

09:49.784 --> 09:52.260
Well, maybe you reassembled
the pieces incorrectly.

09:52.284 --> 09:54.447
The problem is we can't
reassemble the pieces.

09:54.471 --> 09:55.572
We don't have two

09:55.596 --> 09:57.191
full sets of remains.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.695
We're missing pieces.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.922
Yes, and these unrelated pieces, well,

10:01.322 --> 10:04.079
they belong to at least
three different people.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.457
Three more bodies?

10:05.658 --> 10:07.134
We're missing a lot of pieces.

10:07.158 --> 10:08.318
This is more than someone

10:08.360 --> 10:09.600
just dumping two bodies.

10:10.097 --> 10:13.287
I think you're looking
for a mass murderer.

10:21.858 --> 10:24.845
Can't we talk about this?

10:26.607 --> 10:28.148
There's no point...

10:29.323 --> 10:30.913
What do you got, Abs?

10:32.076 --> 10:34.174
Decaying flesh, organs and human tissue.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.928
- The DNA confirms that...
- Five different people.

10:36.952 --> 10:38.740
Well, if you already talked to Ducky,

10:38.764 --> 10:40.216
there's not much I can tell you.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.241
You didn't give me much
to work with, Gibbs.

10:42.265 --> 10:43.615
There's barely any blood.

10:43.639 --> 10:45.201
The bodies were probably drained.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.842
So what, you think we're
looking for a vampire?

10:50.324 --> 10:52.677
There are traces of cellulose, fiber,

10:52.701 --> 10:54.416
common paper and string.

10:54.889 --> 10:55.990
The parts were wrapped.

10:56.014 --> 10:58.301
Yeah, but they're too degraded
to get any fingerprints off of.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.554
There was one thing.

10:59.578 --> 11:01.990
The screws from the marble frontispiece.

11:02.014 --> 11:05.878
They've been collecting rust
since the interment in 1978.

11:05.902 --> 11:07.178
But look at the heads.

11:07.202 --> 11:08.431
They're scratched.

11:08.455 --> 11:10.279
That's from the screwdriver.
It dislodged the rust.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.328
But look at the other crypts.

11:15.079 --> 11:16.299
See the screws?

11:18.643 --> 11:19.866
Yeah. They're all rusted.

11:19.890 --> 11:22.100
Except for these two crypts.

11:22.504 --> 11:26.304
Anson Gage, USMC, Colonel;
Raymond Dalton, U. S. Army.

11:26.328 --> 11:28.943
Might be vandalism, but
it might be something.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.367
- DiNozzo.
- Contact next of kin

11:31.391 --> 11:33.768
and get permission to open
those two crypts. On it, boss!

11:34.769 --> 11:36.009
Nice catch, Abby.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.580
Yeah.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.512
I couldn't help but notice
how quiet it is in here.

11:40.536 --> 11:42.681
- Where's the music?
- I just wasn't in the mood.

11:42.705 --> 11:43.830
Anything...

11:44.599 --> 11:46.238
you want to talk about?

11:46.705 --> 11:48.120
Why would there be?

11:49.393 --> 11:51.144
Yeah, I don't know,
it's just that McGee said

11:51.168 --> 11:52.634
that you weren't really
acting like yourself,

11:52.658 --> 11:54.228
- and so I thought...
- So you guys have been

11:54.252 --> 11:55.635
talking about me?

11:55.659 --> 11:56.758
Yeah. No.

11:57.459 --> 12:00.817
We're wondering if there
was anything bothering you.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.435
You want to know what bothers me?

12:02.459 --> 12:06.496
It bothers me when people
gossip about other people

12:06.520 --> 12:07.880
behind their backs.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.996
Do you really think that that is okay?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.231
Yeah. 'Cause...

12:13.332 --> 12:15.996
I mean, it's the only way to gossip.

12:16.020 --> 12:17.560
'Cause if we talked about you in front

12:17.584 --> 12:19.308
of your face, then that would
just be talking about you.

12:19.332 --> 12:20.957
You know what, we're just not gonna...

12:20.998 --> 12:22.641
we're not gonna do that anymore.

12:23.173 --> 12:24.173
Sorry.

12:25.395 --> 12:26.624
Your aunt lived with you?

12:26.648 --> 12:28.593
When she was in town, yes.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.958
You're sure she was murdered?

12:31.209 --> 12:33.998
Preliminary findings have been
inconclusive, Mr. Torrance,

12:34.022 --> 12:35.577
but it's probable.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.372
When was the last time you saw her?

12:37.396 --> 12:39.936
It's been almost three months now.

12:39.962 --> 12:42.249
And you never filed a
missing persons report?

12:42.273 --> 12:43.748
Well, she does this.

12:44.022 --> 12:47.737
She would meet a new man
with a yacht or a jet...

12:48.587 --> 12:50.311
and disappear for a while.

12:50.335 --> 12:53.835
We always expected she
would resurface eventually.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.059
Just never like this.

13:00.711 --> 13:01.711
Here.

13:01.963 --> 13:06.127
I know how difficult it is to
lose a person you care about.

13:06.151 --> 13:07.151
Thank you.

13:09.212 --> 13:10.564
We'll also need a list

13:10.588 --> 13:12.752
of anyone who has access to your home.

13:12.776 --> 13:15.661
Contractors, workmen, employees.

13:15.713 --> 13:18.252
And also the names of any
of her travel companions

13:18.276 --> 13:20.111
- or associates.
- Of course.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.443
Thank you for coming in so quickly.

13:23.467 --> 13:24.629
If you learn anything...

13:24.653 --> 13:27.028
Please call. As soon as we know more.

13:30.525 --> 13:32.295
They were really cut up.

13:33.114 --> 13:34.129
Sorry.

13:34.153 --> 13:35.743
It's a poor choice of words.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.943
How many more of these
are we going to do?

13:37.967 --> 13:39.315
Uh, at least five.

13:39.339 --> 13:40.579
So pace yourself.

13:41.091 --> 13:43.078
What do you mean by that, McGee?

13:43.279 --> 13:45.779
Nothing. Just, you know,

13:45.837 --> 13:47.659
you got a little emotional in there.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.986
I will meet you upstairs,
Miss Dalton, okay?

13:51.055 --> 13:52.055
Okay.

13:55.528 --> 13:56.528
Next of kin?

13:56.722 --> 13:57.787
Abby thinks there might be more

13:57.811 --> 13:59.816
body parts hidden in
her grandfather's crypt.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.818
You talked to Abby?

14:00.842 --> 14:03.193
- Yeah, McGee.
- I was right, wasn't I?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.318
There's something wrong.

14:04.342 --> 14:05.697
Let it go, probie.

14:06.469 --> 14:08.714
- Why?
- Because I'm pretty sure

14:08.904 --> 14:10.256
it's something you did.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.354
Well, what did I do?

14:11.402 --> 14:13.049
Well, think about it, probie.

14:13.104 --> 14:14.664
I'm sure you'll come up with something.

14:20.218 --> 14:22.559
I don't understand what I'm
supposed to be looking at.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.554
These photos are of
your grandfather's tomb.

14:27.155 --> 14:28.155
I get that.

14:28.565 --> 14:31.148
I assure you this has nothing
to do with your grandfather.

14:31.213 --> 14:33.882
How could it? He's been dead 13 years.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.031
- I was at the funeral.
- Right.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.558
It's been tampered with, okay?

14:38.582 --> 14:41.445
And we believe that there's
evidence hidden inside

14:41.469 --> 14:43.572
relating to an ongoing
murder investigation.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.191
What kind of evidence?

14:45.907 --> 14:48.572
I run my own business, Agent DiNozzo.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.648
That means I'm losing
money every minute that

14:50.672 --> 14:52.062
I have to spend here.

14:52.396 --> 14:53.621
So why don't you just tell me

14:53.645 --> 14:55.220
what it is that you want from me?

14:59.408 --> 15:02.773
We need you to give us
permission to open it.

15:02.908 --> 15:04.052
So if you could just sign...

15:04.888 --> 15:06.818
these authorization forms.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.009
My dad put me to work
right after my grandpa died.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.185
You know the first
lesson that I learned?

15:13.209 --> 15:14.386
What's that?

15:14.410 --> 15:18.664
Don't sign any papers without
having a lawyer look at 'em.

15:18.786 --> 15:20.376
That's a good lesson.

15:20.475 --> 15:22.131
But if it's necessary,

15:22.945 --> 15:24.555
we'll get a federal warrant.

15:24.910 --> 15:27.012
Oh, that would be much easier for me.

15:27.036 --> 15:28.394
You should just do that.

15:29.735 --> 15:30.816
Okay.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.502
Anything else you need?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.254
Just a federal warrant.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Great.

15:45.164 --> 15:46.169
Company, boss.

15:46.477 --> 15:48.197
Special Agent Gibbs.

15:50.478 --> 15:51.478
Colonel Mann.

15:51.637 --> 15:54.765
I got a call your case might
be venturing into CID territory.

15:54.789 --> 15:56.504
That call was premature.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.339
Really? Here I thought
it was four weeks overdue.

16:03.226 --> 16:04.954
I understand you were denied permission

16:04.978 --> 16:07.908
by the family to access
Colonel Dalton's crypt.

16:10.026 --> 16:11.286
Got a warrant.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.429
And that got my attention.

16:13.603 --> 16:14.943
Why don't you fill me in.

16:17.914 --> 16:20.290
Wouldn't want to make a bad
situation worse, would you?

16:22.664 --> 16:24.391
Don't look so nervous, Jethro.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.204
- Do I look nervous?
- No.

16:26.228 --> 16:27.943
You actually look, um...

16:28.291 --> 16:29.826
you look pretty good.

16:33.352 --> 16:35.132
David, DiNozzo, perimeter.

16:36.916 --> 16:39.167
Sure you don't want us to
help you in there, boss?

16:40.668 --> 16:42.081
'Course not, 'cause if
you did, you would've said,

16:42.105 --> 16:43.958
"David, DiNozzo, follow me."

16:43.982 --> 16:45.062
Probie, stop it.

16:46.294 --> 16:47.524
We're not going anywhere.

16:48.169 --> 16:49.639
Why? What'd I miss?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.893
Not like you to leave
something unfinished.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.097
The crime scene.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.059
Ever worry you're slipping?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.083
No.

16:59.090 --> 17:00.282
Any suspects yet?

17:00.607 --> 17:01.792
Nothing concrete.

17:02.170 --> 17:03.772
What does your gut say?

17:03.796 --> 17:05.959
Theory is it's an inside job.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.771
But you don't like that.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.680
So how else would he know

17:10.108 --> 17:13.229
which crypts are vacant?

17:13.263 --> 17:16.078
Ah, read the faceplates.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.951
So the warrant didn't exactly specify

17:18.997 --> 17:20.483
what we're looking for here.

17:20.785 --> 17:23.333
Well, it's best to
not have expectations.

17:23.357 --> 17:25.372
It staves off disappointment.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.006
What are we hoping for?

17:29.357 --> 17:33.192
You throw that "we" word
around pretty casually.

17:37.610 --> 17:40.645
The last time someone tried to remove
one of these, it blew up in his face.

17:43.673 --> 17:46.273
You might want to
step back a little bit.

17:46.297 --> 17:48.247
Thank you for your concern.

17:57.423 --> 17:58.836
I see what you mean.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.060
Expectations.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.011
Gibbs did not look happy to see her.

18:06.112 --> 18:07.212
His body language suggested

18:07.236 --> 18:09.399
he was not comfortable at all.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.524
Eh, nothing makes Gibbs uncomfortable.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.968
Nothing job-related.

18:13.489 --> 18:15.399
You think he ended it with her?

18:15.423 --> 18:17.588
Assuming that he started something.

18:17.612 --> 18:18.842
I don't buy it.

18:18.924 --> 18:20.650
- Why not?
- For one, she's not a redhead.

18:20.674 --> 18:21.900
People do change, Tony.

18:21.924 --> 18:23.819
It's true, even you have a girlfriend.

18:25.362 --> 18:26.526
I haven't changed.

18:26.550 --> 18:28.714
Really? What about the
pretty girl in the office.

18:28.738 --> 18:30.777
- Natalie Dalton?
- Well, you noticed she was pretty,

18:30.801 --> 18:32.026
but you didn't flirt with her.

18:32.050 --> 18:33.338
That would've been unprofessional.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.346
I don't know.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.091
Might have gotten her to
sign the authorization.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.339
Then we would not have need the warrant.

18:38.363 --> 18:40.466
Then Colonel Mann
wouldn't have been here.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.792
And we would be inside doing our job.

18:42.816 --> 18:44.967
- Like professionals.
- All because

18:44.991 --> 18:47.028
you don't flirt anymore. Why is that?

18:47.052 --> 18:49.703
- Enough gossip, McGee.
- Tony, you like to talk about

18:49.766 --> 18:51.255
everyone's private lives.

18:52.052 --> 18:53.652
Talk, yes.

18:54.178 --> 18:56.415
But I don't write entire
books about them, do I?

18:57.116 --> 18:58.716
Does create a bit of a trust...

18:58.740 --> 18:59.740
issue, McGee.

19:00.303 --> 19:01.863
Excuse me. Hi.

19:02.678 --> 19:04.404
Am I able to go inside today?

19:04.428 --> 19:06.558
The mausoleum is closed, sir.

19:10.991 --> 19:11.991
Here it is.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.717
Are you gonna let me in?

19:19.741 --> 19:22.657
I think we should be clear
on the implications first.

19:22.681 --> 19:24.594
You're interfering
with my investigation.

19:24.618 --> 19:26.843
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.470
If there's evidence in here,

19:28.494 --> 19:30.720
I'm gonna be obligated to
see this through to the end.

19:30.744 --> 19:32.344
- And if there's not?
- Then I don't see

19:32.368 --> 19:34.163
why my involvement
shouldn't end right here.

19:41.308 --> 19:42.783
If you wanted to see me,

19:42.807 --> 19:45.283
you didn't have to manufacture a reason.

19:45.307 --> 19:47.721
I follow the orders of
the United States Army,

19:47.745 --> 19:50.097
even when they don't exactly make sense.

19:50.121 --> 19:52.407
- You could've called.
- So could you.

19:52.431 --> 19:54.221
I distinctly remember
the last thing you said

19:54.245 --> 19:55.659
as you were slinking
out of my bedroom...

19:55.683 --> 19:57.542
- I don't slink.
- "I'll call you."

19:57.585 --> 19:59.221
For the record, I didn't
think the last time

19:59.245 --> 20:01.946
we saw each other was gonna be
the last time we saw each other.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.300
Neither did I.

20:03.497 --> 20:05.252
Well, here we are.

20:05.432 --> 20:06.832
Lucky for us.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.398
Call it fate.

20:08.746 --> 20:10.741
You're just gonna let fate decide

20:10.783 --> 20:12.675
whether we go our separate ways?

20:13.558 --> 20:15.093
Five bodies in total.

20:16.122 --> 20:17.911
We've only recovered portions.

20:17.935 --> 20:19.347
You're hoping the rest

20:19.371 --> 20:20.451
- are in here.
- Aren't you?

20:21.623 --> 20:23.653
Honestly, I'm not really sure.

20:30.559 --> 20:33.159
That the answer you're looking for?

20:41.819 --> 20:45.295
If the bodies recovered from
the mausoleum were, in fact,

20:45.358 --> 20:47.190
the result of mass murder,

20:47.225 --> 20:50.513
one might expect a certain modicum

20:50.572 --> 20:52.633
of consistency in the manner of death.

20:52.657 --> 20:53.643
One might.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.448
Yes. And one would be wrong.

20:55.860 --> 20:59.845
Shot, stabbed, strangled, bludgeoned,

21:00.465 --> 21:04.610
and poor Miss Undetermined Torrance.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.249
Three women, two men,

21:06.290 --> 21:10.045
ages ranging from 19 to 70.

21:10.108 --> 21:11.365
Three are Caucasian,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.954
one Asian, and one black.

21:13.989 --> 21:15.926
- No common traits.
- Not in life.

21:15.950 --> 21:19.427
But the blood, however,
settled on different surfaces

21:19.451 --> 21:20.799
on each of the bodies.

21:20.823 --> 21:22.486
Her left thigh and back,

21:22.510 --> 21:24.675
his chest and buttocks, meaning...

21:24.699 --> 21:26.988
The bodies were moved repeatedly.

21:27.012 --> 21:28.799
Precisely. They were
killed and then moved

21:28.823 --> 21:30.893
for some sort of preparation.

21:31.011 --> 21:32.800
You can see the
indentations on the ankles

21:32.824 --> 21:35.770
here and here, here.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.839
Chain-link.

21:37.324 --> 21:38.476
Yes. I believe the bodies

21:38.500 --> 21:42.135
were suspended and drained
prior to being, well,

21:42.577 --> 21:43.800
there's only one word for it.

21:43.824 --> 21:44.824
Butchered.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.128
We sent the tissue samples
to Abby. Hopefully, she can...

21:48.077 --> 21:49.492
Speak of the devil.

21:49.702 --> 21:52.722
What we have here is
paradoxical behavior.

21:52.888 --> 21:54.598
On one side, we have...

21:54.702 --> 21:56.930
An emotional, unrestrained murderer

21:56.954 --> 21:58.989
using whatever means at hand.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.630
Yes. And, on the other,
someone tidy, meticulous,

22:01.654 --> 22:03.514
and almost flawless

22:03.703 --> 22:06.423
in the way he dissected these bodies.

22:07.202 --> 22:08.366
That wasn't Abby.

22:08.390 --> 22:11.140
That was the Director.
She wants to see you.

22:12.515 --> 22:13.715
Both of you.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.179
As far as we can tell,

22:22.203 --> 22:24.056
the only thing that brought
these people together

22:24.080 --> 22:25.743
is how they were taken apart.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.492
In addition to Marilyn Torrance,

22:27.516 --> 22:30.867
we have a 19-year-old runaway
from Florida. He was shot.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.546
30-year-old prostitute.

22:33.017 --> 22:34.180
She was strangled.

22:34.204 --> 22:36.120
No next of kin on either of them.

22:36.144 --> 22:38.805
Wade Carlin, 26-year-old
Georgetown graduate

22:38.829 --> 22:41.368
- from Michigan.
- He broke off contact with his parents

22:41.392 --> 22:43.994
after his girlfriend
dumped him six months ago.

22:44.018 --> 22:46.621
They thought he was Jack
Kerouac-ing around the country.

22:46.645 --> 22:48.181
When, in fact, he was stabbed to death

22:48.205 --> 22:49.621
a few weeks after the breakup.

22:49.645 --> 22:53.069
All missing persons cases.
All have led to nowhere.

22:53.093 --> 22:54.093
Until now.

22:55.394 --> 22:56.394
Gloria Grady,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.870
age 72. Ducky says she
was the first victim.

22:58.894 --> 22:59.894
Blunt trauma.

23:00.019 --> 23:01.705
Only one relative, her son,

23:02.948 --> 23:03.948
Len Grady.

23:04.146 --> 23:05.796
He was at James River.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.183
With a bouquet of flowers.

23:07.207 --> 23:09.515
Lilies. For who?

23:10.395 --> 23:12.371
No record of any Grady at James River.

23:12.395 --> 23:13.746
Could be under a different name.

23:13.770 --> 23:14.896
Could be a friend.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.871
But lilies. They're feminine.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.496
The kind you give to a woman.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.760
Like your mother.

23:21.147 --> 23:24.517
Grady's mother. I
don't know your mother.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.809
Could be visiting his trophies.

23:26.833 --> 23:30.433
Fits the classic profile:
30s, single, white.

23:31.462 --> 23:32.748
We should tell Gibbs.

23:32.772 --> 23:34.309
Yeah? Why don't we
wait till he gets out?

23:34.333 --> 23:37.062
Unlessyouwant to be the one
to interrupt his meeting.

23:37.086 --> 23:38.266
Campfire's over.

23:39.774 --> 23:41.438
Okay. Well, thank you, Colonel.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.002
I will get her back to
you as soon as possible.

23:46.087 --> 23:47.249
Your superiors have agreed

23:47.273 --> 23:49.625
to loan us your
services for the interim.

23:49.649 --> 23:51.996
I trust that there's
not a problem with that?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.374
No. Of course not, Director.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.875
As long as Special Agent Gibbs
continues to be forthcoming

23:55.899 --> 23:57.739
with pertinent information.

23:58.523 --> 23:59.523
Agent Gibbs?

24:00.336 --> 24:03.346
As long as she follows my
lead, I can't foresee a problem.

24:04.964 --> 24:08.199
You two have worked cases
together successfully in the past.

24:08.245 --> 24:09.375
Nothing's changed

24:09.399 --> 24:12.694
to interfere with that professional
relationship, has there?

24:16.525 --> 24:18.253
What do we have so far?

24:18.277 --> 24:20.629
Four confirmed homicides. Likely, five.

24:20.653 --> 24:22.441
- That's all you know?
- I know we're wasting time

24:22.465 --> 24:24.376
debating jurisdictional protocol

24:24.400 --> 24:26.876
and discussing who's entitled to what.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.302
Well, then, why don't
you get back to it?

24:28.326 --> 24:29.442
Yeah. Thank you.

24:29.466 --> 24:30.466
Not you,

24:30.526 --> 24:31.526
Colonel Mann.

24:32.154 --> 24:34.579
I'd like to have a
private word with you.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.513
Breaking in a new pair?

24:47.579 --> 24:50.443
No. I always wear these.
Why do I always wear these?

24:50.467 --> 24:52.592
- Let me see your shoes.
- Okay.

24:54.592 --> 24:58.472
Flat, sensible, functional.
Not very sexy, but..

24:58.541 --> 25:01.616
- But they do the trick.
- What do I want three-inch platforms?

25:01.640 --> 25:02.694
I'm already five-ten.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.068
I love these shoes... just all wrong.

25:05.092 --> 25:06.152
Wrong for who?

25:08.317 --> 25:09.577
The tissue samples.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.256
I don't follow.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.757
You don't want to hear about shoes.

25:12.781 --> 25:15.132
- You want to hearabout tissue samples.
- Sure.

25:15.156 --> 25:17.446
I ran the Torrance tissues
through the mass spec,

25:17.470 --> 25:19.758
and I found abnormal levels of chlorine.

25:19.782 --> 25:21.033
- Chlorine?
- Yeah.

25:21.057 --> 25:22.427
Like in a swimming pool.

25:23.218 --> 25:24.693
Len Grady's Website.

25:24.843 --> 25:26.757
He's a jack-of-all-trades.
Basically,

25:26.781 --> 25:27.881
a guy with a big van.

25:27.905 --> 25:29.259
And a little initiative.

25:29.283 --> 25:31.319
Something of an amateur entrepreneur.

25:31.343 --> 25:32.757
That's not easy to say.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.123
Carpenter, plumber,
gardener, electrician,

25:35.147 --> 25:36.134
TV installations,

25:36.158 --> 25:37.728
- snow shoveling..
- But, most importantly,

25:37.752 --> 25:38.734
pool cleaning.

25:38.758 --> 25:40.134
That supposed to mean something?

25:40.158 --> 25:41.196
Well, he's not just any pool man.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.635
He's the Torrances' pool man.

25:42.659 --> 25:43.883
Grady's got his own key.

25:43.907 --> 25:46.706
Heated. Indoor. Regular monthly
maintenance. I looked into it.

25:46.784 --> 25:49.135
Royalty checks burning a
hole in your pocket, McGee?

25:49.159 --> 25:50.760
Already tied Grady to his mother.

25:50.784 --> 25:51.964
Body number one.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.008
- And now Torrance.
- Body number two.

25:54.032 --> 25:55.502
Let's bring him in.

26:03.673 --> 26:04.698
A lot of people

26:04.722 --> 26:07.822
were pleased to see
Sharif off the streets.

26:07.846 --> 26:11.317
My superiors acknowledged
your letter of commendation.

26:11.989 --> 26:13.198
I want you to know I appreciate it.

26:13.222 --> 26:15.198
The two make an effective team.

26:15.222 --> 26:16.462
Gibbs and myself?

26:16.723 --> 26:19.147
Well, it wasn't just a
flash in the pan, was it?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.672
Your service at CID is up in six months.

26:23.410 --> 26:25.199
You must have started considering life

26:25.223 --> 26:26.511
after the military.

26:26.535 --> 26:27.886
Yes. It has crossed my mind.

26:27.910 --> 26:30.639
The question is how to
best serve your future.

26:30.663 --> 26:33.688
Where the opportunity
for advancement lies.

26:34.910 --> 26:37.576
It's not too early
for a cocktail, is it?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.845
The sun must be down somewhere.

26:40.288 --> 26:41.452
You drink bourbon?

26:41.476 --> 26:43.397
No. Not regularly.

26:44.441 --> 26:47.538
Spend enough time around
Gibbs, and you'll learn.

26:48.225 --> 26:49.225
Believe me.

26:50.165 --> 26:52.075
It's an acquired taste.

26:52.601 --> 26:55.141
And when did you first acquire it?

26:55.977 --> 26:57.387
It's been a while.

26:59.664 --> 27:02.434
But it's something that
stays with you though.

27:13.979 --> 27:15.142
Nobody's home, Boss.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.327
Neighbor said he went
out about an hour ago.

27:17.351 --> 27:18.466
What do we do?

27:18.851 --> 27:19.851
We wait.

27:21.790 --> 27:22.790
Okay.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.203
Colonel Mann still in with the Director?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.827
What do you think they're talking about?

27:27.415 --> 27:28.845
We wait...

27:29.523 --> 27:30.873
silently.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.291
Okay.

27:37.542 --> 27:38.542
I got him.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.508
Len Grady?

27:41.729 --> 27:42.729
Freeze!

27:42.930 --> 27:43.995
Federal agents.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.635
Up, up, up!

27:54.793 --> 27:56.568
What? What?

28:07.418 --> 28:08.543
Bachelor living.

28:08.731 --> 28:10.091
Not every bachelor.

28:15.419 --> 28:17.145
This guy's got a card for everything.

28:17.169 --> 28:18.649
"Len Grady, Painter."

28:18.733 --> 28:20.748
"Len Grady, Fountain Design."

28:21.233 --> 28:23.085
"Cottage cheese ceilings removed

28:23.109 --> 28:24.349
and made smooth."

28:24.672 --> 28:27.961
Anything with a blade on
it, we should get to Abby.

28:27.985 --> 28:29.475
Not really what she wants.

28:30.173 --> 28:32.238
She's upset about her shoes.

28:32.296 --> 28:33.462
Doesn't sound like Abby.

28:33.486 --> 28:36.086
Wrong pair of shoes can
reduce a woman to tears.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.210
She was crying?

28:37.234 --> 28:38.234
Practically.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.143
It's not the shoes.

28:42.234 --> 28:43.594
Got something.

28:43.984 --> 28:44.997
Yep.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.210
White paper package

28:47.234 --> 28:48.889
tied with brown string.

28:50.111 --> 28:51.111
What's that?

28:52.674 --> 28:54.024
It's a pork chop.

28:55.235 --> 28:57.310
- Hear you got our guy in there.
- Maybe.

28:58.923 --> 29:00.628
- What?
- Nothing.

29:01.112 --> 29:02.712
It seems like you were
thinking something.

29:02.736 --> 29:04.024
That's been known to happen.

29:04.048 --> 29:05.408
Something about me.

29:05.736 --> 29:07.213
Thought I recognized your perfume.

29:07.237 --> 29:08.827
I don't wear perfume.

29:08.860 --> 29:10.790
Must have been something else.

29:13.049 --> 29:15.211
So... can I just go ahead

29:15.259 --> 29:16.436
and pay the fine and get out of here?

29:16.460 --> 29:17.484
Fine?

29:18.255 --> 29:20.121
I know I shouldn't have cashed

29:20.162 --> 29:21.928
my mother's Social Security checks.

29:22.301 --> 29:23.711
We're not the IRS.

29:25.550 --> 29:27.278
She went missing last March.

29:27.302 --> 29:28.542
She had dementia.

29:28.738 --> 29:31.430
It was getting worse. She
must have gotten out one day.

29:31.701 --> 29:34.026
We're talking about a
person here, not a dog.

29:34.050 --> 29:36.091
I keep hoping she'll come back.

29:36.115 --> 29:38.315
You already know where to find her.

29:38.991 --> 29:40.339
How do I know that?

29:40.363 --> 29:41.715
You went to visit her.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.159
Brought her flowers.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.528
My mother's at the cemetery?

29:47.552 --> 29:50.107
What's left of her. She was dismembered.

29:51.740 --> 29:54.147
Look at his mind spinning.

29:55.616 --> 29:57.441
He's trying to figure
out how to play it.

30:00.241 --> 30:01.591
I didn't do that.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.281
I took care of my mother.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.928
I fed her.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.951
I cleaned up after her.

30:13.929 --> 30:16.030
You must have been
praying for it to end.

30:16.054 --> 30:17.409
I loved my mother!

30:17.805 --> 30:19.271
Maybe you were right the first time.

30:19.322 --> 30:21.030
It must have been like
putting down a dog.

30:21.054 --> 30:22.843
Only no one ever noticed.

30:22.867 --> 30:25.280
Getting away with it must have
been the real shocking part.

30:25.681 --> 30:28.900
And a new career is born.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.097
You did it again...

30:30.495 --> 30:31.495
and again.

30:32.095 --> 30:34.545
Kelly Camarda, Wade...

30:35.316 --> 30:36.976
Something's not right.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.415
What do you mean?

30:38.743 --> 30:40.343
He looks relieved.

30:41.620 --> 30:42.620
Gloria Grady.

30:45.181 --> 30:46.181
Okay.

30:46.581 --> 30:47.784
Stop.

30:47.819 --> 30:50.159
You have something you want to tell us?

30:50.183 --> 30:52.608
All these people were chopped up?

30:53.369 --> 30:54.669
That's disgusting.

30:56.869 --> 30:59.598
What kind of person do
you think could do that?

30:59.622 --> 31:02.397
I mean, you're looking for a monster.

31:03.246 --> 31:05.306
What do you want me to say?

31:05.498 --> 31:06.498
It's not me.

31:17.047 --> 31:18.247
What now?

31:19.370 --> 31:21.433
Want me to do a lie-detector
test or something?

31:21.699 --> 31:23.069
You just did.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.286
He's telling the truth.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.840
You think I'm wrong?

31:27.960 --> 31:29.848
No. But he was relieved when

31:29.872 --> 31:31.724
you connected her with
the rest of the bodies.

31:31.748 --> 31:34.047
He has no feelings about them at all.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.411
- Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.
- Maybe.

31:36.435 --> 31:38.476
But that doesn't look like
a man who feels trapped.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.734
That looks like a man who
knows he has a way out.

31:41.935 --> 31:43.726
There's something much worse than.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.225
Len Grady out there.

31:46.936 --> 31:48.821
Only he knows what it is.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.059
We've got to push Grady harder
to tell us what he knows.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.078
He won't.

32:00.102 --> 32:01.584
You think he's protecting
the real killer?

32:01.608 --> 32:02.645
He's protecting himself.

32:02.669 --> 32:04.819
I can prove that he's not acting alone.

32:07.208 --> 32:08.960
Trying to run down Grady's van.

32:08.984 --> 32:10.022
No luck so far.

32:10.046 --> 32:11.337
He was on foot when you apprehended him.

32:11.361 --> 32:12.398
So what did he do with his ride?

32:12.422 --> 32:13.770
And when did he do it?

32:13.794 --> 32:15.650
After he spotted us at the cemetery.

32:15.674 --> 32:17.401
What, he just happened to be visiting?

32:17.425 --> 32:19.090
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

32:19.114 --> 32:21.839
Well, he wanted information.
He was there to watch us.

32:21.863 --> 32:24.028
But he got there as quickly as I did,

32:24.052 --> 32:25.775
so how did he know
about the investigation?

32:25.799 --> 32:27.079
He's got a friend on the inside.

32:27.835 --> 32:29.656
One person's a psychopath,

32:29.691 --> 32:30.964
two people's a conspiracy.

32:30.988 --> 32:32.873
So who was he talking to?

32:33.161 --> 32:34.528
Grady doesn't leave here

32:34.552 --> 32:36.528
until we know everything about him.

32:36.552 --> 32:38.987
You start with yesterday
and you work backwards.

32:43.676 --> 32:44.676
Go.

32:46.677 --> 32:47.677
Forensics?

32:48.616 --> 32:49.861
- Boss...
- Yeah.

32:55.802 --> 32:57.218
If you're going to go see Abby,

32:57.242 --> 32:58.717
I think you should know she's
going through something...

32:58.741 --> 33:01.281
I'm not going empty-handed, McGee.

33:02.428 --> 33:03.428
Gibbs.

33:04.179 --> 33:06.529
- And Lieutenant Colonel Mann.
- Abby.

33:06.553 --> 33:08.842
Can I interest you in some knives?

33:08.866 --> 33:12.094
I've got kitchen knives,
pen knives, pocket knives,

33:12.118 --> 33:15.343
Swiss army knives, razor
blades, X-acto blades,

33:15.367 --> 33:18.217
scissors, saws,
scalpels, hedge clippers,

33:19.055 --> 33:22.079
an adze, an awl, a fish scaler

33:22.114 --> 33:24.056
and even a golf-hole cutter.

33:24.505 --> 33:26.990
All recovered from Grady's pigsty?

33:28.757 --> 33:32.232
Reflected in the care he
used to maintain his cutlery,

33:32.256 --> 33:35.151
there's dings and nicks and dull edges.

33:35.194 --> 33:38.046
None of these correspond to
any of the precise incisions

33:38.070 --> 33:39.734
used to dismember the corpses.

33:39.758 --> 33:40.993
For such a slob,

33:41.318 --> 33:43.857
he certainly is careful when it counts.

33:43.881 --> 33:46.171
There wasn't a single trace
of human blood anywhere.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.500
Human blood...

33:47.758 --> 33:49.795
Your boy Grady is
something of a carnivore.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.423
From the remnants on his silverware,

33:51.447 --> 33:53.923
I could pretty much tell you
every meal he had for a week.

33:53.947 --> 33:55.492
Liverwurst, knockwurst,

33:55.697 --> 33:58.111
pastrami, roast beef, rack of lamb.

33:58.135 --> 33:59.610
Which leads us to...

34:00.982 --> 34:02.139
this.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.125
The pork chop from his freezer.

34:07.821 --> 34:10.463
Probably his next meal.

34:10.498 --> 34:12.297
When I pull it up, it
gets really interesting.

34:12.822 --> 34:15.176
It matches the incisions on the bodies.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.922
Tool mark analysis isn't as precise

34:16.965 --> 34:18.426
as say fingerprints or ballistics,

34:18.449 --> 34:20.860
but I can conclusively tell
you that none of the blades

34:20.885 --> 34:23.337
in Grady's possession carved that pig.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.795
Well, why would they?

34:25.697 --> 34:27.788
He probably had it carved.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.677
His partner's a butcher.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.574
Don't you have work to do?

34:38.887 --> 34:40.657
Look, it's not something

34:40.822 --> 34:44.547
that you can fix in the classic
Gibbs hit-and-run style, okay?

34:48.387 --> 34:49.922
I got time, Abs.

34:52.387 --> 34:53.387
It's stupid.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.364
It's just...

34:56.257 --> 34:57.390
a guy.

34:57.953 --> 35:00.053
I'm not going to start spilling my guts

35:00.077 --> 35:02.682
just because you keep standing here.

35:06.514 --> 35:09.764
All right, apparently
I am too much for him.

35:09.789 --> 35:10.865
Can you imagine that?

35:10.889 --> 35:11.889
Me?

35:12.202 --> 35:13.865
And it's not what you think.

35:13.889 --> 35:15.982
It's not all this.

35:16.017 --> 35:17.190
He likes...

35:18.056 --> 35:19.788
he likes small women.

35:19.889 --> 35:22.839
I got dumped 'cause I'm too... too big.

35:24.015 --> 35:25.241
And don't even bother

35:25.265 --> 35:28.180
with the, "No, it's
him. He's too small."

35:28.204 --> 35:30.242
Or "If he can't accept
you for who you are

35:30.266 --> 35:32.303
then it's his problem," thing.

35:32.327 --> 35:35.366
He just doesn't think
that we could make it work

35:35.390 --> 35:37.630
and I've done everything I can

35:38.143 --> 35:40.493
to try to convince him that he's wrong.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.171
So I guess. I'm just
going to have to accept it.

35:51.457 --> 35:52.772
And let it go.

35:58.706 --> 36:00.011
Thanks, Gibbs.

36:01.269 --> 36:03.334
You always know what to say.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.369
Metro P. D. Responded to
the BOLO on Grady's van.

36:07.393 --> 36:09.818
So far 13 possibles and counting.

36:10.082 --> 36:11.082
McGee.

36:11.331 --> 36:12.973
Supermarkets, slaughter houses,

36:13.016 --> 36:14.306
any place with a butcher on site

36:14.352 --> 36:16.628
within a 20-block radius
of Grady's residence.

36:19.037 --> 36:21.258
Narrow the search to boutique shops.

36:21.282 --> 36:22.972
They'd need their privacy.

36:26.497 --> 36:27.571
There's just one.

36:27.595 --> 36:28.593
Just one?

36:28.617 --> 36:30.259
Boutique butcher's a dying industry.

36:30.283 --> 36:32.897
- Where?
- Le Cochon, Mass Avenue.

36:32.972 --> 36:34.323
All right, get a list of employees,

36:34.347 --> 36:35.962
owners past and present.

36:37.784 --> 36:38.784
Let's roll.

36:48.972 --> 36:49.972
Ms. Dalton.

36:52.537 --> 36:54.073
I thought you said you didn't need me.

36:54.097 --> 36:56.074
What's your relationship with Len Grady?

36:56.098 --> 36:58.138
Len, he's my boyfriend.
Why? What's going on?

36:58.162 --> 36:59.950
You told Grady you
spoke with us earlier?

36:59.974 --> 37:01.509
Yeah, I mentioned it.

37:03.598 --> 37:05.448
Is this about the investigation?

37:08.086 --> 37:09.075
Where is Len?

37:09.099 --> 37:10.099
In custody.

37:11.286 --> 37:13.776
We suspect he's committed
at least five murders.

37:14.974 --> 37:16.140
That's impossible.

37:16.164 --> 37:18.114
Len would never hurt any...

37:18.850 --> 37:19.850
Five?

37:20.039 --> 37:21.039
At least.

37:22.911 --> 37:24.446
Where's your freezer?

37:34.352 --> 37:35.577
Nothing in here, Boss.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.328
Just pork, beef and lamb.

37:37.352 --> 37:39.182
What else would there be?

37:39.790 --> 37:40.790
Human blood.

37:42.413 --> 37:43.413
Human?

37:43.914 --> 37:45.089
What's in here?

37:45.290 --> 37:47.017
It's a freezer I use
for overflow to store

37:47.041 --> 37:49.126
geese and turkeys in the holidays.

37:49.977 --> 37:50.977
Got a key?

37:57.915 --> 37:59.891
What kind of evidence
did you say that you found

37:59.915 --> 38:01.143
in my grandfather's crypt?

38:01.167 --> 38:03.453
Does Grady has access to your store?

38:03.477 --> 38:05.242
He's here all the time.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.580
Look, this can't be happening, okay?

38:06.604 --> 38:08.729
There must be some kind of...

38:25.793 --> 38:27.683
He was a regular customer.

38:27.793 --> 38:29.628
Every week like clockwork.

38:30.481 --> 38:33.269
It was the only time that he
could get away from his mother.

38:33.293 --> 38:34.473
He felt trapped.

38:36.418 --> 38:39.080
I could tell that he needed
to get on with his life.

38:39.981 --> 38:41.922
It started with a few
words here and there.

38:41.996 --> 38:43.024
And then...

38:44.671 --> 38:45.834
before long we were...

38:45.858 --> 38:46.858
Together.

38:47.170 --> 38:48.230
Not fully, no.

38:48.606 --> 38:50.731
We didn't trade keys until...

38:52.108 --> 38:54.003
after she disappeared.

38:57.672 --> 38:59.267
He learned your trade.

39:01.359 --> 39:02.359
I taught him.

39:04.548 --> 39:07.088
He always wanted to try new things.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.695
I never suspected that...

39:13.048 --> 39:15.228
How could I not have seen it?

39:16.109 --> 39:17.644
Love makes you blind.

39:21.473 --> 39:23.673
I must be some kind of monster.

39:28.798 --> 39:31.873
Is she the monster
you were talking about?

39:32.235 --> 39:33.738
No,

39:34.538 --> 39:35.985
she loves me.

39:36.052 --> 39:37.052
How?

39:39.486 --> 39:40.601
We're in love.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.863
Then she had to know about it.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.463
She had to know the real you.

39:45.487 --> 39:47.197
She didn't do anything.

39:47.363 --> 39:48.363
You're right.

39:48.486 --> 39:50.399
She could have stopped you.

39:50.423 --> 39:52.433
She should have stopped you.

39:52.737 --> 39:53.912
If it was real.

39:54.486 --> 39:55.721
She didn't know!

39:56.176 --> 39:58.241
I hid it. I hid everything.

39:59.425 --> 40:01.310
Just leave her out of it.

40:02.915 --> 40:04.120
Natalie!

40:04.155 --> 40:06.101
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Natalie!

40:06.177 --> 40:08.005
I'm so sorry!

40:09.215 --> 40:11.776
I love you! I love you so much!

40:13.402 --> 40:14.957
I'm sorry!

40:15.691 --> 40:17.884
Let's try this again. Marilyn Torrance.

40:18.114 --> 40:20.089
She was swimming in
her pool. I drowned her.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.113
Wade Carlin.

40:21.237 --> 40:23.402
Natalie was at the wholesale market.

40:23.426 --> 40:25.030
He came in for a
sandwich. I stabbed him.

40:25.054 --> 40:26.090
She was a hooker.

40:26.114 --> 40:27.655
I was lonely. Natalie was out of town.

40:27.679 --> 40:28.778
I strangled her.

40:28.802 --> 40:30.480
And the kid was nobody.

40:30.523 --> 40:32.467
Nobody. I just shot him.

40:32.491 --> 40:34.031
You kept them in the
freezer for over a year.

40:34.055 --> 40:35.530
Why'd you move the bodies?

40:36.004 --> 40:37.815
Why did you move them?

40:38.679 --> 40:40.154
He needed the space.

40:41.303 --> 40:42.893
No one could stop me.

40:42.992 --> 40:44.882
You were gonna kill again.

40:47.615 --> 40:48.735
He already did.

40:50.056 --> 40:51.996
What did you do with the body?

40:52.493 --> 40:53.613
Doesn't matter.

40:55.369 --> 40:56.489
Doesn't matter.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.614
No, no... No. No!

41:01.182 --> 41:02.803
No! Natalie!

41:03.369 --> 41:05.494
Find the van. Find the body.

41:08.182 --> 41:09.182
Let her go.

41:13.894 --> 41:14.969
Still at work?

41:14.993 --> 41:17.971
Yeah, I was just catching
up on some things.

41:17.995 --> 41:18.995
Cheek swabs.

41:20.559 --> 41:23.439
Hey, your music's back on.

41:23.744 --> 41:24.907
You're feeling good again.

41:24.931 --> 41:26.051
Maybe not good.

41:26.559 --> 41:29.257
Not yet. But better.

41:29.807 --> 41:32.728
You know how sometimes a guy

41:32.783 --> 41:34.559
can get you all tied up inside.

41:34.660 --> 41:35.660
Yes.

41:35.808 --> 41:38.347
And then you can't get the knots out?

41:38.371 --> 41:39.371
Yes.

41:39.809 --> 41:43.162
Well, it just really helped me
to talk things out with Gibbs.

41:43.186 --> 41:45.136
You know, unknot the knots.

41:46.245 --> 41:48.037
'Cause even if you don't let it show,

41:48.061 --> 41:49.656
people can still tell.

41:52.245 --> 41:53.761
So, you know, if you ever want

41:53.805 --> 41:55.093
to talk about Lieutenant Sanders...

41:55.117 --> 41:56.098
I liked him.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.774
He died. And,

41:58.509 --> 42:00.397
what else is there to say?

42:08.747 --> 42:09.747
Well,

42:10.148 --> 42:11.877
I am glad you feel better.

42:18.312 --> 42:19.539
With the right partner,

42:19.563 --> 42:21.540
you can make the perfect, monster?

42:21.564 --> 42:22.543
Oh yeah,

42:22.567 --> 42:25.011
give me a little old-time romance.

42:26.813 --> 42:29.265
Someone's got hidden
skeletons of his own.

42:30.617 --> 42:33.703
You know, if I ever find
myself in a dire situation,

42:33.738 --> 42:35.725
the proverbial body
I need to get rid of...

42:35.749 --> 42:37.634
I think I would tell you.

42:37.937 --> 42:39.062
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:45.001 --> 42:46.913
What makes you think
I wouldn't turn you in?

42:46.937 --> 42:48.404
If there's one thing
you're good at, Jethro,

42:48.428 --> 42:50.343
it's keeping your mouth shut.

42:50.567 --> 42:53.102
You made the right call
letting the girl go.

42:53.126 --> 42:56.452
Seems you always make the
call when it involves a case.

43:16.145 --> 43:17.145
Oh, son of a...
