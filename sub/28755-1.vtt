01:39.229 --> 01:40.448
Still drinking?

01:46.236 --> 01:48.020
Abbie, you still drinking?

01:56.246 --> 01:57.726
Sixty seconds!

02:27.103 --> 02:28.235
Thirty seconds!

02:47.384 --> 02:49.125
Are you deaf?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.829
Fuck!

03:00.310 --> 03:01.790
Ten seconds. Hurry up.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.493
Huh?

03:10.755 --> 03:11.887
Time!

03:16.108 --> 03:17.197
Oh, well.

03:22.854 --> 03:25.117
See if you don't quit
this time.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.555
It smells like
a fucking fart bag over here.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.170
All right.

03:34.257 --> 03:39.306
Round six
in three, two, one...

03:39.393 --> 03:43.179
Three minutes.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.022
Hold still.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.678
I said hold still.
I'm trying to get focus.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.380
You spill one drop,
I'm calling it.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.864
Looks like
it's dribbling down your chin.

04:15.951 --> 04:19.781
I'll disqualify you. I will kick you out unless
you can learn to drink like a fucking human.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.870
I am a human.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.698
You sure?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.702
Where'd you get these?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
Dallas got 'em
from Arin Bechdel.

04:29.878 --> 04:33.273
Arin Bechdel got 'em from, I don't
know, some sales guy at work.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.709
And then
I got 'em from Dallas,

04:34.796 --> 04:36.928
so I gotta beat 'em all
before I gotta give 'em back.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.887
Aren't you afraid of Arin?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.845
No. Why would I be?

04:42.456 --> 04:44.066
I think
you're afraid of Arin.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.156
Trying to beat these?

04:47.243 --> 04:49.680
I'm just trying
to flip the world.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.987
I think you can only
do it in San Francisco.

04:52.074 --> 04:55.686
Just go up, down,
and the quarter pipe four times,

04:55.773 --> 04:58.820
slide rail
halfway down the pipe,

04:58.907 --> 05:03.128
jump over the right side,
ollie out, land on the cage.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.522
I only did it once
by accident,

05:05.609 --> 05:09.961
but... the whole level,
it flips upside down.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.834
The screen freezes and shakes
for a little bit.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.749
Now, they're gonna fix this before
the game comes out next year,

05:14.836 --> 05:16.751
but it is a good glitch.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.971
Trying to find the glitches?
Yeah.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.539
Because you can't
really beat this game.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.066
It's the new fucking Shadowgate.
That game's impossible.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.938
It's gonna take you weeks.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.288
I sa--
I saved Kal Torlin.Huh.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.247
Escaped all three towers.
What about this one? Huh?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.293
Ah. I escaped the asylum.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.077
Whoa.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.427
Thirty seconds.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.299
Huh.

05:44.735 --> 05:48.522
"Pac-Man"?
Says it's the arcade version.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.828
Yeah, I don't really
like the old games.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.614
You don't like the old games? They're hard.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.621
Ten seconds.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.711
Come on.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.106
Four. Three. Two.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.631
One! Time!

06:10.718 --> 06:12.502
Whew.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.678
That was close.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.550
You gonna blow?

06:16.637 --> 06:17.986
You sure?

06:18.073 --> 06:19.683
I just have to pee.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.425
Oh. There's a bathroom
right over there. Go for it.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.428
No. You'll disqualify me.
Try it.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.387
You're gonna make me
start all over again. Try it!

06:46.493 --> 06:47.624
Ohh!

06:53.108 --> 06:57.591
Round seven
in three, two, one--

06:57.678 --> 06:59.549
Just one second. No, there's no breaks.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.683
No, come on. There should be at
least, like, a minute between glasses.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.642
That's against the regulations.
What, are you trying to quit?

07:05.729 --> 07:08.645
Well, can I have
some ice then? That dilutes the lactose.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.039
Three, two, one.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.389
Drink up!

07:24.356 --> 07:26.054
What are you doing?
Are you packing?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.754
Going to Uncle Ronnie
and Ronnie's.

07:30.841 --> 07:34.410
Working on the new compound.
Everyone's gonna be there.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.804
Who's "everyone"? Everyone.

07:36.891 --> 07:37.979
Even Joao?

07:38.066 --> 07:39.546
So?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.896
Well, can I come? Sure.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.420
Mom's gonna be there. To do your laundry?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.295
What did you say?

07:50.382 --> 07:51.471
Nothin'.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.084
You know what?

07:58.303 --> 08:01.132
I think I'm just gonna take this whole
box set over so everyone can watch it.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.352
Don't.
Yeah.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.616
We'll let 'em see "The
Quitter's Guide to Quitting."

08:06.703 --> 08:08.879
I didn't quit. Sure? Huh.

08:08.966 --> 08:12.927
Let's start from the top. "Mr. Burger
challenge." Only completed eight of the ten.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.885
Yeah,
I wasn't hungry anymore. Let's see here.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.148
We got the catnip
cigarette challenge.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.500
I swallowed some. Oh, sure.
You didn't quit.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.328
And we got-- Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Full Volume Headphone Blast."

08:23.415 --> 08:25.417
You only got through
two of Hammett's solos.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.594
I told you I didn't want songs
longer than eight minutes.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.686
You know what would have been
the ultimate challenge?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.905
You gettin' a fucking job.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.994
Wait.
You quit that one too.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.779
That's right.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.173
Old Cortez throws a hot dog at
you, and you go running home.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.828
Could've paid the rent. Oh, you
could've paid the rent?

08:46.569 --> 08:48.876
Man, I know Mom
pays for everything.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.140
Where'd you hear that?

08:55.796 --> 08:58.015
Where'd you hear this, huh?
Was it your boyfriend Dallas?

08:58.102 --> 09:01.236
She gives the landlord
a check every month. Says who?

09:01.323 --> 09:03.238
And she takes it out of
Dad's savings account.

09:05.153 --> 09:08.243
Dad's savings?
He didn't have shit when he left.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.812
Mom should have told you that when she
fucking evicted you from the basement.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.944
Hey, I left on my own. Oh, really?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.077
When she found you down there
writing love letters to him?

09:16.164 --> 09:18.209
They weren't love letters.
"Dear Daddy Sicko" --

09:18.296 --> 09:20.211
He wasn't a sicko! You tell that
to the court, motherfucker!

09:20.298 --> 09:23.693
It was a silly misunderstanding.
That's all.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.566
Dad was broke when he left.
Nothing there, idiot.

09:27.741 --> 09:28.829
Fuck!

09:31.483 --> 09:33.355
Oh, shit. Here we go.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.925
What, did I
hurt your feelings? Huh?

09:40.405 --> 09:41.581
What's wrong with you?

09:42.930 --> 09:45.062
Huh? What happened to you?

09:46.281 --> 09:47.717
You got ten seconds, bitch.

09:47.804 --> 09:52.113
Nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

09:52.200 --> 09:54.942
four, three, two--

09:56.030 --> 09:57.205
Time!

09:58.554 --> 10:00.208
Oh, that was fucking close.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.038
Whew!
Half a glass left, man.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.693
That's a big deal.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.043
You might actually complete
a challenge.

10:14.222 --> 10:17.094
Mom used to always
race us to the bus stop.

10:17.181 --> 10:20.532
She always let you win,
and I always would come in last place.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.231
Why did she
do that to me?

10:23.318 --> 10:25.886
What are you talking about?
Dad used to always let me beat him.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.671
What?

10:28.758 --> 10:30.630
Y-You asked
what happened to me.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.465
I... I was just kidding.
I was just kidding around. Geez.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.293
Come on. Let's go.
Round eight.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.165
Three, two, one. Here we go! No, w-w-wait.
Are you gonna blow?

10:44.252 --> 10:46.167
Hold on! Are you gonna blow?
Stop it!

10:46.254 --> 10:49.518
I'm getting a fucking bucket. This is
not official. Time has not started yet.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.086
Wait right there. I'm gonna go in the
basement, get a bucket and a fucking mop.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.088
You move,
I will fucking kick your ass.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.529
No fucking cheating either.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.581
Don't tell Janitor Jim
I stole this.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.844
Not that he understands
a word anybody says anyway.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.716
Did you
put the key back?

12:03.026 --> 12:05.637
You're in luck.
Giving you a five-minute break.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.728
Found you
a little present.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.555
Where'd you get that?

12:10.642 --> 12:13.515
Apartment 417.You stole it?

12:13.602 --> 12:16.170
So? Bunch of fuckin' nerds.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.564
Look. It's your
little kid Pac-Man game.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.697
And some fuckin' caveman.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.264
No, that's
Billy Mitchell.Hmm.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.961
Says he's got a contest.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.618
Can I see it? Hundred thousand dollars.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.707
Come on. Let me see. You want it? Grab it.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.101
Come on. Grab it.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.104
I call challenge break.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.540
I call disqualified!

12:41.456 --> 12:42.587
Hoo!

12:47.114 --> 12:50.073
Says you gotta beat
his record. What's his record?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.858
Couldn't get past
level 256.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.123
This Mitchell
sounds like you.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.560
"If you want to attach
your name to a record,

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
if you want your name
written in history,

13:00.910 --> 13:03.260
you have to pay
a price."

13:03.347 --> 13:04.696
Fuckin' homo.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.004
Can-- Can I please see it?

13:08.091 --> 13:09.440
Beat 256. That's it.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.792
What would you even do
with $100,000?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.012
I'd buy a jet. What?

13:16.099 --> 13:18.145
Or a boat.
Go to California.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.888
You'd go from Michigan
to California on a boat.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.499
Yeah.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.242
Look at this.
Some Chinese kid with a bowl haircut

13:28.329 --> 13:30.853
named Jeffrey Yee
did it in 1982.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.073
Reagan even sent him
a letter.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.597
Yee claims he videotaped
it and then lost the tape.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.425
Fuckin' lame.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.254
You know, Dallas just got some
bootleg Pac-Man tapes sent to him

13:40.341 --> 13:41.733
from his Uncle Bodo
in Nepal.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.953
Maybe that's it. Oh, fuck that!

13:44.040 --> 13:46.782
Dallas is such a liar,
and you know it.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.177
Well, he traded half
his two-headed snake for it. What?

13:50.264 --> 13:53.397
He traded half
his two-headed snake for it.Mmm.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.530
Break's over, Sweetchuck.
Back to the challenge.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.445
Where's that milk jug?

13:57.532 --> 13:59.099
No-- What-- No.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.189
Y-You said
just eight baby bottles.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.104
That's not what I said.
Besides, I want the jug in the shot.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.540
We're making
fucking art here.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.585
You've gotta finish off that milk jug.
Where is it?

14:07.672 --> 14:10.545
No, you said specifically
it was just eight baby bottles.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.677
That was the finish of the challenge.
You gotta finish all the milk!

14:12.764 --> 14:14.766
If you don't consume
all of the milk--

14:14.854 --> 14:16.725
That's not
what you said, Cam! You heard me.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.379
No, you said--That is the rules.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.033
Yeah, but-- "But" --

14:20.120 --> 14:23.558
Oh, look, there it is.
Yes.

14:23.645 --> 14:28.345
So you gotta finish all the milk in the jug, and
I don't care how many bottles it takes you.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.086
That's what I said.
No, it isn't. You said--

14:30.173 --> 14:32.088
That's exactly what I said. No, it isn't.

14:32.175 --> 14:35.135
You said as soon as eight of 'em are
done, then that was it.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.963
That's not what I said. And you can't even
refill it.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.878
That's not the rules. The top--

14:38.965 --> 14:42.359
The challenge stated if you don't
consume all the milk that was in the jug,

14:42.446 --> 14:43.839
then you lose.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.710
You cannot just fill it
when the top is on already!

14:45.797 --> 14:48.322
Fuck it. I'm gonna tell
you one thing one time.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.280
This is not right, Cam.
You have quit everything in your life.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.326
And you're finally getting
close to finishing a challenge.

14:52.413 --> 14:55.677
I just topped it off.
Now, we got round eight.

14:55.764 --> 14:59.594
It's going to start
in three, two, one...

15:00.769 --> 15:01.813
Three minutes.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.601
Come on.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.734
We're all rootin' for ya.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.172
You got this.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.003
You quit?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.613
You can do it.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.357
There you go.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.012
Just put it to your lips.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.492
Suck it down.
You're almost there.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.716
Got it.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.718
That's good.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.074
Wh-Whoa.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.337
It's pretty rotten.
You should smell it.

15:47.424 --> 15:50.210
No way. I smelled it already. It's
definitely rotten. That makes it better.

15:52.386 --> 15:55.302
This is-- This is
above room temperature.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.870
That's good. That makes it more...
tasty. It's full-bodied.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.745
No. No. No way.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.489
Time's ticking.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.534
You just gonna quit again?

16:10.621 --> 16:12.884
I'll be okay.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.235
You have no survival skills.
You know that? None.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.063
You barely survive
on this couch.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.676
You still
don't believe it? Huh?

16:21.763 --> 16:25.288
So this very specific numerical algorithm
which controls the date and time,

16:25.375 --> 16:27.464
which in turn controls the
motherboard of the computers,

16:27.551 --> 16:30.293
won't be entirely fucked
when everything flips to zeroes?

16:30.380 --> 16:32.817
You own one thing. It's not even
gonna work six months from now.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.864
There ain't no Nintendo
in the Y2K.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.912
Don't fuckin' quit.
All right?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.916
You are this close
to finishing

16:45.004 --> 16:49.008
the first fucking challenge
you have ever fucking completed.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.401
Are you really gonna
fucking give up?

16:51.488 --> 16:52.968
I'm fucking serious, man.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.276
You got 60 seconds.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.625
You got this.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.022
Just suck
that thing down.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.112
Put it in your mouth.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.506
Come on.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.511
Fuck, man.

17:17.992 --> 17:19.342
Thirty seconds.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.001
Abbie, you can do this.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.006
Twenty, 19, 18,

17:31.093 --> 17:34.401
17, 16, 15, 14--

17:34.488 --> 17:37.317
Fuck! Get the bucket!
Get the bucket!

17:41.495 --> 17:43.018
Fuck!

17:47.675 --> 17:49.677
I knew I should have borrowed
Jim's fuckin' tarp.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.508
Where's my fucking keys?

17:56.162 --> 17:57.859
Do we have any Popsicles?

17:57.946 --> 18:00.557
Get up and get it yourself.
This challenge is over.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.213
I'm too sticky
to get up now.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.172
We have
any blue ones left?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.176
On the floor, Mongo.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.354
Hit the streets, homeless.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.790
Oh, but y--But--

18:19.228 --> 18:20.360
Fuck!

18:26.801 --> 18:28.107
One more challenge.

18:29.673 --> 18:32.459
One more final,
ultimate challenge.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.810
You're not gonna just quit? I won't.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.507
You will.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.466
I quit quitting. What?

18:39.553 --> 18:41.120
I quit quitting.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.778
Fine.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.786
One last ultimate challenge.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.093
Regulations still in effect.
You don't get off this fucking couch.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.268
Name it.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.018
What are you doing?

19:10.105 --> 19:12.368
Come on.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.414
Cam.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.775
Fuckin' gross, man!

19:29.211 --> 19:31.082
Level 256.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.171
What?

19:33.389 --> 19:35.391
You get past level 256.

19:35.478 --> 19:38.177
You beat that fucking record,
you fucking collect that money,

19:38.264 --> 19:39.830
you show up that caveman,

19:39.917 --> 19:42.268
and then you go live
with Daddy Dearest forever.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.966
Rules apply.
No getting off this couch.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.446
Stretch breaks? Nope.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.319
Can I lay down? No!

19:50.406 --> 19:53.409
You do not leave this couch
until the challenge is completed.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.286
Challenge accepted.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.550
Are you sure?

20:06.857 --> 20:08.816
Challenge accepted.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.340
Okay.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.999
Well, how long do I have?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.219
Till I get back.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.395
You coming back tonight? Nope.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.310
Tomorrow? Who knows?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.660
Can I come with?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.357
Are you
quitting already?

20:28.444 --> 20:29.793
No.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.320
I'm gonna take
pity on you.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.496
I'm gonna give you until New Year's Eve.
That's right, son.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
You have until the Y2K.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.543
What? Mm-hmm.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.719
You're gonna stay on that couch
and you're gonna protect it.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.635
Fuckin' relax!

20:45.722 --> 20:47.333
Probably be done
before tonight.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.770
You gotta tape it.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.902
Think you can handle
that?

20:51.989 --> 20:55.210
Think you can aim this at the
TV, press the little red button?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.169
Gonna be able to
take care of yourself?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.954
Be able to keep in all
your pee-pee and your poo-poo?

21:02.173 --> 21:04.741
Where's my keys?

21:04.828 --> 21:07.091
Where the fuck are my keys?
Does Chuck E. Cheese deliver?

21:07.178 --> 21:08.702
Call fuckin' Domino's.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.924
Goddamn it.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.405
I had two knives and a set of
keys on this fucking counter.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.321
Where's Joao's knife,
and where's my fuckin' keys?

21:19.408 --> 21:22.019
Did you fucking touch
my keys again? No way, José.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.543
"José"?

21:25.066 --> 21:26.372
What you know
about José?

21:28.243 --> 21:29.505
Aha!

21:31.899 --> 21:34.858
Huh?
I'll tell you about José.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.818
José Domingo. He's an old
fisherman, lived down in Mexico.

21:37.905 --> 21:41.300
Lived on the beach. He fished all day.
And you know what?

21:41.387 --> 21:44.172
What he didn't eat for lunch or dinner
at the end of the day, he sold off.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.088
And one day, along
come the white man. Yeah.

21:47.175 --> 21:50.657
American businessman on Mexico
vacation comes up to José and says,

21:50.744 --> 21:53.007
"I got a suggestion for you.

21:53.094 --> 21:57.272
Why don't you hire somebody to do your fishing
and somebody to run that stand for you?"

21:57.359 --> 22:00.971
Old José gives it a try. Next day
he makes three times as much money.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.671
Here come that
American businessman again.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.500
He says, "José,
I got another suggestion.

22:07.587 --> 22:10.503
You should hire
an entire fleet of fishermen."

22:10.590 --> 22:13.244
Next thing you know, José's sitting up in
that office, sitting behind a mahogany desk.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.421
He got a hundred employees
in his corporation.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.597
There go 40 years.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.948
All of the sudden, José's an old man.
He can barely walk.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.776
He decides
it's time for retirement.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.433
You know what he does?

22:27.520 --> 22:29.609
I asked you a question!
Do you know what he does?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.698
No. What? I don't--
What does he do?

22:31.785 --> 22:34.135
He goes and lives on the
beach, fishing all day,

22:34.222 --> 22:35.876
selling off what he doesn't
eat at the end of the day,

22:35.963 --> 22:37.356
happy as shit!

22:38.444 --> 22:39.793
And nobody bothering him.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.624
So?

22:47.017 --> 22:48.454
The American dream.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.459
Am I him?

22:57.811 --> 22:59.160
Get to fuckin' work.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.164
I'll see you
when you're dead. What?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.517
Don't take no shits
on my couch.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.348
Get to work. Are you coming back?

23:15.655 --> 23:16.873
Cam!

23:27.797 --> 23:30.365
Dallas. Hey,
I'm in a challenge emergency.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.759
Need you to bring over a Chuck E.
Cheese pizza, a large,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.630
a cherry cola, two-liter--

23:34.717 --> 23:38.199
I'll pay you when you get here.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.636
Hey, you know that Pac-Man
tape that your uncle gave you?

23:40.723 --> 23:43.465
Hell yeah, dude. I need you to bring that
with you too.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.688
Oh, hey, and I need you to do a
secret knock when you get here.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.646
I need to make sure
it's not Arin.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.431
Okay, here it goes.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.090
Do it back.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.225
That's not right.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.535
Wh-- Tomorrow?

24:11.493 --> 24:14.278
No, I-I can't wait that long.
What are you doing right now?

24:17.238 --> 24:18.544
Hello?

24:19.849 --> 24:21.372
Hello?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.071
Well,
why don't you deliver?

24:25.942 --> 24:28.728
No, it's not a birthday party.
It's a challenge.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.469
And it needs to be a delivery.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.081
Is this Brad Matusak?

24:34.168 --> 24:35.561
Hey, this is Abner Harmeyer.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.606
Abbie.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.959
Hello?

24:55.363 --> 24:56.843
Come on,
dude, open the door!

24:57.757 --> 24:59.236
Shh-shh.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.284
Do the secret knock.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.285
Well...

25:10.857 --> 25:13.642
What was that? I don't know.
The Olympics song?

25:13.729 --> 25:16.819
Th-The fuckin'
secret code?

25:16.906 --> 25:19.387
Whatever, dude.
The fuckin' jig is up. It's me.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.782
Just use the
key. Where is the key at?

25:22.869 --> 25:25.611
Same spot.
Where's the fuckin' same spot?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.482
Think above your head.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.658
Are you doing Maya
Angelou shit or something?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.399
What the fuck
are you saying?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.357
I-It's just--
It's above the door.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.229
Thank you.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.978
Don't gotta yell at me, all pissed off
and shit. It's always in the same spot.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.370
Yeah, like your ass.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.285
Did you put
the key back? Yeah--

25:48.372 --> 25:50.636
It smells like fuckin' mouth
farts up in here, dude.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.420
Where's
the Chuck E. Cheese?

25:52.507 --> 25:53.987
Dude.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.424
Brian Pontiac told me that
Cam got footage of you

25:56.511 --> 25:58.469
spewing milk
all over the place, dude.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.559
Oh.I wanna see that shit.
That's what I came for.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.518
What fuckin' tape is it on?
Just forget about that.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.651
I ain't gonna forget about it.
That's the shit I came over for.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.741
If I had my own Hi-8 tape player,
I'd fuckin' watch it at home.

26:08.828 --> 26:12.222
But I still need the fuckin' tape.
Which one is it?

26:12.309 --> 26:14.485
Just don't worry about it.
It says "first drive."

26:14.573 --> 26:16.618
You got video of your first
time you fuckin' drove?

26:16.705 --> 26:18.707
One of 'em.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.709
How can you have multiple
first times you drove?

26:20.796 --> 26:21.710
It's...

26:23.016 --> 26:25.584
multi-cam.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.891
Oh, shit. Is this your birthday
when you fuckin' cut your knuckle?

26:29.979 --> 26:32.373
Does it say "15th"? Mm-hmm.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.549
Yeah. We should fuckin'
watch that too.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.030
Well, dude, get your fuckin' ass up.
Here, help me find this.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.293
I can't get up.
It's part of the challenge.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.383
Fuck the challenge. Put that shit on pause for
five minutes just to help me find the tape.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.558
No.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.430
All right, then I
fuckin' challenge you

26:46.517 --> 26:49.042
to get up and help me
find the tape.

26:49.129 --> 26:52.088
I can't do a challenge when I'm
already on another challenge.

26:52.175 --> 26:55.875
Jesus Christ. Then I challenge you to
challenge me to challenge you notto get up.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.486
I don't know what that means.
It doesn't fuckin' mean anything.

26:58.573 --> 27:02.359
Just get off the couch. You're in this
fuckin' challenge vortex of retardedness.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.406
Why don't you have the pizza?
Fuckin' Brad Matusak was there, man.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.626
I hate that dude.
Him and his little fuckin' butt-hole.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.193
He spilled chili cheese on my work
pants, didn't even apologize.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.456
You shouldn't say that.
Say what? "Little butt-hole"?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.633
No. "Hate." Oh, sorry.

27:14.720 --> 27:18.158
I didn't mean to fuckin' infringe
on your sensitivity and shit.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.726
It's hot in here, man. No shit.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.163
Can you open this window for
me and prop it with something?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.556
Jesus Christ. Could you, please?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.602
Here. Will this work? Yes.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.953
For fuck's sake, dude.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.477
Didn't realize I was
your fuckin' personal assistant.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.963
Dude, it smells ill.
Where-- Seriously, where are you shitting?

27:41.050 --> 27:42.878
Dude--

27:42.965 --> 27:45.011
And since there's no pizza,

27:45.098 --> 27:48.188
would you just grab me one of my baloney
sandwiches from the kitchen, please?

27:48.275 --> 27:50.364
That'd be great. All right. I'm on it.

27:50.451 --> 27:51.757
Yes, Your Highness.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.806
Man, I don't see
anything in here, dude.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.026
Well, did you look
in the microwave?

28:01.592 --> 28:03.116
Did I what?

28:03.203 --> 28:05.335
In the microwave.
I'm looking in the fridge.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.033
Some Mother Hubbard shit.
Well, check the microwave!

28:07.120 --> 28:08.338
Why would I--
Fuck.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.211
Your light's
tweakin' out, dude.

28:11.298 --> 28:14.170
It's my night-light. Night-light?
It's an epileptic light.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.520
Just leave it alone. I'm not gonna touch
your light, dude.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.653
I ain't an electrician.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.136
Did you find 'em? I'm looking.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.966
They should have
two holes in 'em.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.058
I'm lookin'.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.016
I need both of them though.
I gotta ration 'em out.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.150
Mm-hmm. What are you doing?

28:37.237 --> 28:40.327
Nothin'. I'm fuckin'
looking for your sandwiches, dude.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.340
I found it.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.782
That shit's hard
as fuck, dude.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.002
That's, like,
an antique sandwich. There's just one?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.568
That's all
that was there.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.224
What are those? Popsicles? They were.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.705
They're fuckin' like liquid
Jolly Ranchers now. Shit melted.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.058
Were you drinking
the Kool-Aid?

29:16.145 --> 29:18.713
I don't even like Berry Blast.
How'd you know it was Berry Blast?

29:20.802 --> 29:23.762
I wasn't wheezin' your juice, dude.
Stop giving me that accusatory look.

29:23.849 --> 29:27.461
Well... did you bring the
two-liter cherry cola, at least?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.985
- Yeah. You got the money?
- I'll owe you.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.987
Fuck that.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.511
The shit ain't free, dude.
It's fuckin' 89 cents.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.513
Come on, man.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.429
I know you got a knife in the couch.
Just give me that. I'll trade you.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.431
Man, I don't have a knife.
I know you got a knife.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.477
Just fuckin' trade me that
and we're even stephen.

29:43.564 --> 29:46.523
I got no knife. All right,
then show me the money.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.570
Fuckin' show me the money,
fuckin' Jerry Maguire-style.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.094
Look, soon I'm gonna
have a lot of money.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.140
I'm gonna have,
like, $100,000.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.620
Yeah, right.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.623
No, really. I'll pay you then.
Just fuckin' show me the money, dude.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.669
Look--You fuckin' seen Jerry Maguire?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.671
- You know what I'm talkin' about?
- No.

30:03.758 --> 30:06.630
"Show me the money!"
Fuckin' Thomas Cruise-style.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.719
I don't know--You should see it though.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.026
It's got Jerry Cantrell from
fuckin' Alice in Chains in it.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.333
He plays, like, a fuckin'
Kinko's, uh, employee.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.596
There's a part where
Thomas Cruise comes in,

30:15.683 --> 30:18.381
and he's got, like, a mission statement
he fuckin' stayed up all night and wrote--

30:18.468 --> 30:21.254
Okay, look, I--I'm just trying
to fuckin' tell you--

30:21.341 --> 30:22.559
Yeah, I know. See the movie.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.648
I'm gonna have
$100,000 real soon.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.694
Fuckin' Cuba Gooding Jr.
won an Oscar for the movie.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.739
Who? Fuckin' Cuba Gooding Jr.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.438
Look, man, I promise--

30:31.525 --> 30:34.136
He plays the football player that Tom
Cruise's character takes on as a client

30:34.223 --> 30:36.660
when no one
believes in him.

30:36.747 --> 30:40.055
How come no one believes in him? Because
he left a high-end agency on his own.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.362
He was trying to be
a maverick of the industry

30:42.449 --> 30:44.668
and base hisself on ethics
rather than just money.

30:44.755 --> 30:47.323
So with that said,
fuckin' show me the money.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.065
Look, I told you, I'm gonna pay you later.
No, fuck that. Fuck paying.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.067
Challenge me.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.461
Let's do a challenge
for the pop. Challenge you?

30:55.375 --> 30:56.550
To do what?

30:59.074 --> 31:01.903
Oh, you've had
two of 'em? Hell yeah.

31:01.990 --> 31:02.948
Two-liter hands.

31:04.384 --> 31:06.255
Well, hand.Hands.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.778
Hand. Two-liter hands.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.519
No, hand. Hands.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.261
Hand.Hands.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.567
"Han-duh." Hands.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.264
"Han-duh." Hands.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.484
"Han-duh." Hands.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.573
No. 'Cause I
need one of them.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.357
Hands. "Han-duh."

31:21.444 --> 31:23.969
Are you fuckin' blind?
Hands. Two hands, dude.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.448
Right, but one of 'em's
gonna be mine.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.192
You don't think I can drink all this shit?
You see, I know all about--

31:30.279 --> 31:33.065
Last week during a shift, I drank a
whole three-liter and two belly busters.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.284
I didn't even piss.
With the fuckin' AC blastin'.

31:35.371 --> 31:38.331
I know. You've been bragging about it to everybody.
That's why I'm not gonna challenge you.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.899
Yeah, because I got a strong-ass
dick with pinching capabilities.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.988
I don't challenge you.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.603
Fuck it.
I'll challenge myself.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.230
Fuck.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.373
Help me
with this shit, dude.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.899
Here, fuckin' grab it. Help me spin
this shit. Get out of the way, man!

32:27.423 --> 32:29.817
Help m-- Here. Fuckin' put it-- I can
only get my fingers on it right now.

32:29.904 --> 32:32.254
Let me drink one.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.953
This one's regulation here. It's the
second hand that always fu-- Fuck!

32:35.910 --> 32:37.825
Here. No, you--

32:37.912 --> 32:40.132
Just pull it. Do it around my hand, dude.
Get out of the way! What are--

32:40.219 --> 32:41.742
Fuckin' Indiana Jones
this shit around you.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.837
"Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands."What movie's that?

32:49.924 --> 32:53.014
- Can I have some?
- Fuckin' Total Recall, dawg.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.886
I gotta put this shit down
on the stool. Hold up.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.801
Can I have that cup? Fuck no.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.065
Unless you got
some money for it.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.588
Boom! Who am I?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.201
Fuckin' C.J.
Pam Anderson, dawg.

33:06.288 --> 33:07.855
Big-ass titties.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.249
You know her titties
got soda in 'em too.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.555
Do you have that tape you got
from your uncle? The Pac-Man tape?

33:12.642 --> 33:14.993
Check it out.
Fuckin' gunslinger. Boom.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.952
Fuckin' Texas outlaw right here,
fuckin' pullin' pistols out and shit.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.172
Can I please have some?

33:20.259 --> 33:22.130
You please may not have some
because you ain't shown me no money.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.132
May I please
have some money?

33:24.219 --> 33:26.700
What's that fuckin' song?
♪ Money, money, money Money ♪

33:26.787 --> 33:28.528
♪ Money ♪ Fuckin'
karate kick right there.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.444
No,
you're shaking it all up.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.924
- No--
- Fuckin' MTV Grindand shit.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.275
Come on, man. Put me on that shit,
I'll be an all-star, dawg.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.365
Can you do that shit?
No.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.282
Oh, shit.
He's put on his glasses.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.588
We got a fuckin' four-eyed,
3-D dickwad over here.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.329
Oh, shit.
I'm really scared now.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.027
I's scared that he's never
gonna show me the money.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.246
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.682
Stick your dick
in honey!

33:54.467 --> 33:55.598
Please.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.341
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.039
Oh, Jesus fuck!

34:04.390 --> 34:05.478
Oh...

34:17.620 --> 34:19.492
Dude, that was fuckin' insane.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.018
I don't know if it was
because I was shakin' it,

34:25.106 --> 34:28.327
or if you did some fuckin'
Professor X sorcery-type shit on me.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.460
Can I please have a drink now?
You know what I'm sayin'?

34:31.547 --> 34:32.940
Someone steps to you,
they're gonna get fucked with hard

34:33.027 --> 34:34.768
if you can do
that mind control shit.

34:43.297 --> 34:44.777
What is this?

34:47.781 --> 34:49.043
What are you doing? Shh.

34:54.483 --> 34:55.527
What is this?

34:55.614 --> 34:58.313
Read my mind, dude. What?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.359
I wanna see if this mind control
shit you're doing is fuckin' legit.

35:00.446 --> 35:02.883
I wanna know if that was
a freak accident, or if you--

35:02.970 --> 35:04.885
Just read my fuckin' mind.
Scan me.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.888
What am I
thinking about?

35:09.846 --> 35:12.240
You're thinking about how you'd
like to give me a drink right now.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.590
Come on, man.
Take this shit serious.

35:14.677 --> 35:17.724
Tell me what
I'm fuckin' thinkin'.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.988
Come on, man.
Here, t-t-tell me what my mind is thinkin'.

35:21.075 --> 35:23.338
- Carmen Electra.
- Are you fuckin' serious?

35:23.425 --> 35:25.601
That's insane, dude. You always think
about Carmen Electra.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.603
No, I don't, dude,
because my dad got fuckin' cable now.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.823
We got the E Network,
so Brooke Burke is my girl now.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.173
Then why are you thinking about
Carmen Electra? I don't even know!

35:32.260 --> 35:34.741
I haven't had a jam session to
fuckin' Carmen Electra in a while.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.570
Can I just please have a drink?

35:40.834 --> 35:43.706
Yeah, I guess so. Let me get you a cup.
I'll put it in this cup for you.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.099
Don't--

35:45.186 --> 35:46.448
No! No! St-Stop.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.713
What?

35:50.800 --> 35:54.282
Come on. Please.
It's-- It's completely wasteful.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.370
Why--

36:01.898 --> 36:03.117
Dig in, player.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.426
Well, did you at least
bring your uncle's Pac-Man tape?

36:07.513 --> 36:09.645
Yeah. It's in the fuckin' Popsicle bag.
Toss it here.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.440
How long is this? Like, four hours.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.269
Four hours?

36:32.407 --> 36:33.843
Should start in a second.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.461
This shit's fuckin' hypnotic.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.476
No-- Fuck. Think my uncle
just forgot to rewind it.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.933
If you could play tic-tac-toe against
yourself, do you think you could win?

37:21.456 --> 37:23.502
Who, me?

37:23.589 --> 37:25.025
Anyone. I don't care.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.855
Yes. You just have to be
smarter than yourself.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.513
That makes sense.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.524
If you could have a super power,
which would you do, invisibility or flight?

37:47.482 --> 37:49.702
I don't know.
Invisibility.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.358
Fuckin' sex predator. Huh?

37:53.445 --> 37:55.229
You gotta be naked
to be invisible, dude.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.753
Otherwise, you're just a fuckin' pair
of pants and a shirt runnin' around.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.452
All right, fine.
Flight.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.802
Pervert. What?

38:02.889 --> 38:05.152
You gotta be naked
to fly too.

38:05.239 --> 38:07.720
Why? Solar-powered body.

38:07.807 --> 38:10.505
Oh-- Just hit "play."

38:10.592 --> 38:13.726
Fine. We'll be in the middle of season
two and won't know where the fuck we are.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.119
"Season two"?

38:23.344 --> 38:26.304
Great. I have no idea what's happening right
now. Looks like a fuckin' Pac-Man picnic.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.088
Dallas, what is this?

38:28.175 --> 38:30.046
That's what happens when you
start it right in the middle.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.484
What is this?

38:32.571 --> 38:34.355
It's the fuckin' lost season, dude.
They never released this shit.

38:36.749 --> 38:40.100
- This isn't the Jeffrey Yee tape.
- Jeffrey's a poseur, dude.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.971
This is a Pac-Man cartoon!

38:42.058 --> 38:44.496
My fuckin' uncle had to trade half
his two-headed snake for this.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.890
You think you can buy this at Media Play?
Try to order that shit. Good fuckin' luck.

38:47.977 --> 38:51.981
I mean, you got this silly tape
that's just some stupid cartoon.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.288
This was an emergency.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.811
Doesn't your dad like cartoons?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.640
What?

38:58.727 --> 39:01.339
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'.No, I don't.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.819
Don't they all like cartoons? Who's "they"?

39:03.906 --> 39:05.908
I think you know. No, I don't.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.823
You fuckin' know, dude!

39:07.910 --> 39:12.480
You come over here, you got no pizza,
you got nothing for me to drink.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.177
And then this silly tape
of this cartoon!

39:14.264 --> 39:16.397
Fuck this, dude.
Ungrateful dumb-ass!

39:16.484 --> 39:18.268
This is supposed to be
an emergency.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.619
Fuckin' challenges. You know what's
challenging? Your brain capacity.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.185
You're mentally challenged.
Put the game back on.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.754
Slow-ass VCR.
Man, you can go eat a butt.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.371
Don't-- You'd better not. Don't! I'm
serious.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.286
Don't do that. I'm--

39:37.723 --> 39:39.768
I'm--

39:39.855 --> 39:43.337
I'm serious, dude.
I'll chuck this at you. D-Don't.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.557
I won't come back.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.472
Man, stop fuckin'
lookin' at me like that. Hey!

39:48.647 --> 39:49.648
Oh, you do that...

39:57.699 --> 39:59.658
Throw this shit at you.
You gonna get fuckin' sticky.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.486
You're gonna get sticky, dude.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.401
Fuck that! I'm out!

40:08.144 --> 40:09.189
Woot woot!

43:08.324 --> 43:09.587
Oh, Jesus.

45:36.429 --> 45:37.386
Cam?

45:41.129 --> 45:42.870
Did you forget your key?

45:54.708 --> 45:56.666
Are you Janitor Jim?

46:01.019 --> 46:02.455
What?

46:07.460 --> 46:09.114
What?

46:09.201 --> 46:13.379
Oh.

46:13.466 --> 46:16.817
I bet you're smelling Dallas' baloney
sandwich from the refrigerator.

46:16.904 --> 46:20.038
Could you hand me that cup real quick? I
think there's a little left in the bottom.

46:32.006 --> 46:34.574
I-I don't actually
live here.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.548
You know, I actually need that
open, if that's okay.

46:54.463 --> 46:55.856
What is he saying?

46:55.943 --> 46:57.423
Gas.

46:57.510 --> 46:59.294
Gas?

46:59.381 --> 47:02.776
Bug bomb.

47:02.863 --> 47:05.039
What does that mean? Bug bomb.

47:06.519 --> 47:07.912
Bug bomb?

47:11.741 --> 47:13.831
Bug bomb.

47:16.311 --> 47:18.574
12 hours.

47:18.661 --> 47:20.968
You have to be out
12 hours.

47:22.317 --> 47:23.449
Understand?

47:24.929 --> 47:27.801
I'm kinda busy right now.

47:27.888 --> 47:30.325
C-Could you come back
a little later--

47:30.412 --> 47:33.894
Get up.

47:33.981 --> 47:35.200
I am looking for eggs.

47:39.944 --> 47:41.293
Right.

47:41.380 --> 47:45.688
I'm on a challenge right now.
Could you tell...

48:05.230 --> 48:07.145
On three.
One, two, three.

48:16.023 --> 48:18.330
Well, how 'bout you
move me over by the kitchen

48:18.417 --> 48:21.246
so I can get something
to eat that way?

48:21.333 --> 48:23.335
Does that-- that work?

48:24.466 --> 48:27.339
Holy shit! Bart Simpson?

48:30.037 --> 48:31.821
Oh.Garbage?

48:33.998 --> 48:36.000
I can't-- I can't
really see the TV now.

48:37.175 --> 48:40.352
Uh... Give me a number seven.

48:41.353 --> 48:42.354
One more.

48:44.530 --> 48:47.881
It's gonna be pretty hard to
play the video game from here.

48:50.275 --> 48:52.625
It'd be great if you could
just kinda swing me back.

48:53.234 --> 48:54.279
No.

48:56.716 --> 49:00.807
I'm playing this video game,
and if I beat it, I get $100,000.

49:00.894 --> 49:05.246
So, I'll give you 10,000.

49:05.333 --> 49:07.074
What are you talking about?

49:07.161 --> 49:09.033
If you move me back,
then I can beat the video game.

49:09.120 --> 49:13.037
But I can't do it from here,
so there's no money that way. See?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.214
Keep talkin'.
I'm interested.

50:30.331 --> 50:33.378
Hello?

50:33.465 --> 50:34.379
Abbie.

50:35.510 --> 50:36.903
Ma?

50:36.990 --> 50:38.818
It's Arin Bechdel.

50:42.430 --> 50:44.737
Dallas told me
where the key was.

50:44.824 --> 50:46.391
I tried calling you.

50:47.522 --> 50:50.656
Yeah.
My night-light went out.

50:51.787 --> 50:53.441
Night-light?

50:53.528 --> 50:55.095
It's above the sink.

50:55.182 --> 50:59.143
It keeps going on and off,
and it just went off.

51:00.448 --> 51:02.755
Everything just got weird
around here.

51:04.017 --> 51:05.540
How long have you
been sitting there?

51:07.412 --> 51:09.849
What day is it? Thursday.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.809
What's the date? It's the 25th.

51:13.896 --> 51:15.202
It's Christmas?

51:15.289 --> 51:16.334
July.

51:18.858 --> 51:21.556
2000?Mm-mmm. Not yet.

51:23.645 --> 51:28.215
Well, I've been sitting here
for a few hours, I guess.

51:28.302 --> 51:29.869
Is it okay if I come in?

51:30.609 --> 51:31.523
Yeah.

51:33.655 --> 51:36.354
I brought a newspaper.
You like comics, right?

51:40.706 --> 51:42.708
You need anything
else?

51:44.449 --> 51:45.450
No, I'm okay.

51:53.371 --> 51:56.678
Abbie, we gotta get this together.
This is not good.

51:56.765 --> 51:59.333
Can I just borrow the
game for one more day?

52:00.508 --> 52:01.901
You're still playin'.

52:03.946 --> 52:05.774
I gotta beat level 256.

52:05.861 --> 52:07.080
What?

52:07.907 --> 52:09.256
Cam challenged me.

52:11.693 --> 52:12.781
256?

52:14.522 --> 52:15.523
Yeah.

52:15.610 --> 52:17.873
The Billy Mitchell contest?

52:17.960 --> 52:19.614
You know about that?

52:21.399 --> 52:22.748
It's impossible.

52:24.793 --> 52:26.317
What?

52:26.404 --> 52:28.449
Level 256 is a glitch.

52:30.756 --> 52:32.149
What?

52:33.976 --> 52:35.630
Billy Mitchell can't even do it.

52:36.936 --> 52:38.242
It's not possible, sweetheart.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.722
No. But...

52:42.724 --> 52:44.596
It's a publicity stunt,
the contest.

52:46.337 --> 52:49.644
No, but I can.
I can do it.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.733
I just need to borrow the
game for one more day.

52:51.820 --> 52:53.300
Can I, please?

52:53.387 --> 52:54.432
Why?

52:57.086 --> 52:58.740
Have you ever been
to California?

53:02.744 --> 53:03.745
Disneyland a few times.

53:05.007 --> 53:08.446
Ch-Check this out.

53:18.325 --> 53:20.414
It's for my dad.

53:20.501 --> 53:24.157
He lives out there.
I just thought he might need one.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.769
I'm gonna give it to him.

53:29.467 --> 53:31.817
He used to always buy
survival stuff for me and Cam.

53:33.775 --> 53:34.689
Like these.

53:41.261 --> 53:43.307
Yeah, he said
they'd help me.

53:45.134 --> 53:47.833
But Mom always told me
to throw them away.

53:48.616 --> 53:49.530
So...

54:01.368 --> 54:04.023
Look, maybe this will help.

54:04.110 --> 54:09.028
There was a kid
named Jeffrey Yee... Wu.

54:10.029 --> 54:12.466
He created a pattern.

54:13.554 --> 54:15.904
Yeah. You know about him?

54:15.991 --> 54:19.517
Yeah.
My ex-boyfriend sure did.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.564
So, you can walk
through ghosts,

54:23.651 --> 54:25.827
but you have to use
this pattern.

54:25.914 --> 54:29.701
And it has to be
within 1/60th of a second.

54:29.788 --> 54:31.180
Not everybody can do it.

54:42.017 --> 54:43.497
Do you remember
when we worked together?

54:44.803 --> 54:46.195
Mmm.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.720
Maybe I could try
that again.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.852
Do you still
work there?

54:50.939 --> 54:55.596
That wasn't a good week for you.
I'm a nurse now.

54:55.683 --> 54:59.078
You're a nurse? Yeah. Cortez still
works there though.

55:00.427 --> 55:02.429
How do you know? Hmm.

55:04.170 --> 55:06.346
Hey, the car's running.

55:06.433 --> 55:09.306
Cortez, I need you
to wait downstairs, please.

55:09.393 --> 55:12.396
Smells like
Uncle Ron's crib up in here.

55:12.483 --> 55:15.964
- Man, turn on some goddamn lights!
- I'll be down in a second.

55:17.792 --> 55:20.229
Look at this skinny-ass punk
sitting on the couch.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.101
What the fuck you doin',
sittin' talking to this motherfucker?

55:24.190 --> 55:25.800
Will you wait downstairs,
please?

55:28.281 --> 55:32.372
Yo. Yo, what the fuck-- What's
your fuckin' name again, bro?

55:32.459 --> 55:36.376
It's, um... some girl's shit, right?
Like Ashley, or some shit like that?

55:36.463 --> 55:38.683
- Abner.
- Abbie.

55:38.770 --> 55:40.119
That's right.

55:40.206 --> 55:42.774
So, you know about
this kid's dad?

55:42.861 --> 55:44.428
Don't.

55:44.515 --> 55:45.603
Yo, tell her.

55:47.735 --> 55:48.997
Abbie, don't.

55:50.521 --> 55:52.653
Well, I just know
what people told me.

55:54.438 --> 55:56.701
He left when
I was in second grade.

55:56.788 --> 56:00.661
Went to California
and became a truck driver.

56:00.748 --> 56:04.926
And... he was just helping out some
high-school kid with his flat tire.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.669
I think they were
at a rest stop or something.

56:08.756 --> 56:13.108
And... I don't know.
He's not supposed to be in trouble.

56:13.195 --> 56:15.328
Yeah. Keep goin'.

56:15.415 --> 56:16.460
Cortez.

56:18.810 --> 56:23.858
Well, they had to go in the restroom
to talk more about the tire warranty,

56:23.945 --> 56:26.339
'cause it was pouring rain
outside.

56:27.949 --> 56:30.430
Or something.
He was just trying to be helpful.

56:30.517 --> 56:32.214
He's really not
supposed to be locked up.

56:33.955 --> 56:35.566
He got arrested. Prison queen.

56:35.653 --> 56:37.002
Cortez.

56:39.526 --> 56:42.616
Do you know where Pleasant
Valley Correctional Facility is?

56:42.703 --> 56:45.924
- It might be by Disneyland.
- Oh, my God. Let's go.

56:46.011 --> 56:48.361
This gay-ass shit
up in here, man.

56:49.710 --> 56:51.495
Cortez. Come on.

56:51.582 --> 56:52.974
Define "gay-ass shit."

56:54.672 --> 56:57.239
Well--Come on, tell me.
I wanna hear.

56:57.326 --> 56:58.632
- What?
- Tell me.

56:59.590 --> 57:01.026
What's "gay-ass shit"?

57:02.462 --> 57:06.031
I don't know.
Maybe... Maybe kissin'.

57:06.118 --> 57:09.338
Rubbin' they dicks together
and shit. I don't know.

57:09.426 --> 57:13.255
So, you must
think about this a lot. Oh, come on.

57:13.342 --> 57:15.910
So, you think about this every time
you look at all guys, or just gay guys?

57:18.086 --> 57:19.044
Let's go.

57:20.611 --> 57:22.743
So, question for you:

57:22.830 --> 57:25.398
Do you think about sex
every time you look at a woman?

57:27.661 --> 57:29.315
What?

57:29.402 --> 57:31.535
Do you think about sex
every time you look at a woman?

57:33.580 --> 57:35.539
Can we go, please?

57:35.626 --> 57:37.715
I'm not going anywhere
with you till you tell me.

57:37.802 --> 57:40.369
Do you think about sex
every time you look at a woman?

57:44.896 --> 57:46.288
No. No, I don't.

57:46.375 --> 57:48.377
Why not? Come on, man.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.206
Martel probably got some big motherfuckers
out here looking for me right now!

57:51.293 --> 57:53.295
- Who the hell is that?
- Shit. Come on. Let's go!

57:54.775 --> 57:56.690
What the fuck
is you lookin' at?

58:13.141 --> 58:14.099
Abbie.

58:18.843 --> 58:20.105
Abbie!

58:21.628 --> 58:23.412
Abbie!

58:28.374 --> 58:31.333
3-D glasses.
What the fuck is this bullshit?

58:33.422 --> 58:36.077
You can stay if you want.
I'm outta here.

58:38.079 --> 58:39.167
I can't.

58:40.299 --> 58:42.780
Look. Here, take this.

58:46.653 --> 58:48.133
So I can keep the game?

58:52.877 --> 58:53.965
Arin!

59:02.495 --> 59:04.236
Y-You gotta put the key back!

01:02:21.607 --> 01:02:22.521
Yeah.

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:07.784
Okay.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:09.873
Okay.

01:03:24.322 --> 01:03:25.453
Okay.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.281
Okay.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:29.762
Yeah.

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:32.243
Yeah.

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.849
Hey, Dallas. I got a challenge.

01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:59.678
This one--
It's a real emergency.

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:02.115
It's not-- No.

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:04.378
I-- This is what happened. I--

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.513
No, no. It's--

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.342
Dallas.

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.390
Dallas.

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.700
No. Help me, man.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.861
Oh.

01:05:57.562 --> 01:05:58.519
Oh.

01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:06.038
My father, your father...

01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:08.519
were hanging up clothes.

01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:12.436
My father punched your father

01:08:12.523 --> 01:08:14.916
right in the nose.

01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:17.962
What color was the blood?

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:23.533
R-E-D spells red,
and you are not it.

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:25.710
You're not it.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:06.854
Oh!

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.694
You are it.

01:10:53.118 --> 01:10:58.036
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:05.957

That's a tie.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:21.048
That's a tie.

01:13:23.964 --> 01:13:25.313
Tie as well.

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:31.494
They're all ties.

01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:38.109
What have we got? Sports.

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:45.725
And sports, sports.

01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.466
Where's the comics, man?

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:48.685
"The Far Side."

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.431
Yeah.

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:04.657
"Thank God I'm saved."

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:17.496
Oh! Because
he saved the palm tree.

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:20.281
Saved the palm tree.
"Thank God I'm saved."

01:14:27.114 --> 01:14:28.594
"Thank God I'm saved."

01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:31.075
But I'm not saved.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.556
I'm not saved.

01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:34.687
No.

01:14:34.774 --> 01:14:36.907
You know, I-I quit!

01:15:43.451 --> 01:15:45.323
Hey, Cam, check this out.

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:01.426
Here we go.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:12.628
I hate you.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:12.165
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:17.518
six, five, four, three,
two, one.

01:20:12.242 --> 01:20:14.070
Cam!

01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:33.540
Find them Kool-Aid packets?

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:36.979
Joao!

01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:38.502
Fuck.
You listening to me?

01:21:40.286 --> 01:21:41.200
Shit.

01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:07.357
Abbie.

01:22:22.763 --> 01:22:25.157
Oh. Hey, Cam.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.510
Oh, hey, Joao.

01:22:33.731 --> 01:22:34.950
I didn't quit.

01:22:38.127 --> 01:22:39.215
What are you doing?

01:22:44.394 --> 01:22:45.612
Relaxing.

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:50.313
You've been sitting here
this whole time?

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:54.273
Well...

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:56.449
what time is it?

01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:00.758
Who knows?

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:06.111
Oh, man.

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:09.245
I've been here since
this morning, I think.

01:23:13.423 --> 01:23:14.902
Did I miss Fourth of July?

01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:22.475
A-Am I dead?
Where is everybody?

01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:24.129
The bunker.

01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:27.306
Is Dad there? Dad.

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:29.482
You get the toilet paper?
Let's go. Come on, hurry up.

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:30.483
Is he there?

01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:34.400
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:37.664
He said that, uh,
he started walking last week.

01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:39.666
He's just out there
looking for some snow boots.

01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:43.366
Really? No, fucking idiot.
He's probably dead.

01:23:43.453 --> 01:23:45.672
People are eating each other
alive out there.

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:48.153
It's just like I said.

01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:54.464
I think it's my fault.

01:23:55.508 --> 01:23:57.684
I broke it. What?

01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:01.123
Level 257.

01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:03.473
I saw it.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:16.486
And it's like when we were kids,
and we were riding in the car,

01:24:16.573 --> 01:24:18.966
and we'd see a sunset,

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:21.056
and...

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:23.710
the light would come
through the windshield,

01:24:23.797 --> 01:24:26.539
and Dad would say,
"That's what it looks like

01:24:26.626 --> 01:24:28.976
when a big bomb goes off
in the distance."

01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:33.677
And it felt like
it could hurt you.

01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:36.897
And it did
give me headaches.

01:24:36.984 --> 01:24:40.118
But I didn't get headaches
this time because I--

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:42.033
I think it's
because of the glasses.

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:45.776
I-It was amazing.

01:24:45.863 --> 01:24:50.433
The... crowds of people
were cheering me on.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.391
And there were...

01:24:54.045 --> 01:24:57.440
colors, explosions.

01:24:57.527 --> 01:25:00.921
It was...
It was like I was in California.

01:25:03.968 --> 01:25:05.752
Joao! Let's go!

01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:08.712
Give me a slice
of that pizza.

01:25:16.937 --> 01:25:19.549
So, you're just gonna
sit here until you die?

01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:27.426
No. I'm just gonna relax
for a little while longer.

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.479
We could use this.
Joao, take it.

01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:41.962
What's this shit? Hey, don't touch that.

01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:44.095
What is it? Hey, be careful.
He's sleeping.

01:25:46.053 --> 01:25:47.577
Oh! Don't!

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.276
Damn. It actually
doesn't look that bad.Cam.

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:53.365
We'll just boil him up.No. I mean it.

01:25:53.452 --> 01:25:54.410
You want a bite?

01:25:55.367 --> 01:25:56.238
Hmm?

01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:01.156
Take it.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:03.593
Come on.

01:26:04.768 --> 01:26:07.074
Shit. You can't--

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.121
You can't stand
up, can you?

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:11.122
Huh?

01:26:13.298 --> 01:26:16.606
Put... him... back.

01:26:20.392 --> 01:26:21.828
You're not allowed
to touch him.

01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:29.445
You wanna beat me up?

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:31.838
Hmm?

01:26:34.493 --> 01:26:36.800
Try it! Come on!

01:26:36.887 --> 01:26:38.715
Take it!

01:26:38.802 --> 01:26:41.761
Come on. Stand up.
You hate me, don't you?

01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:45.112
You've always fuckin' hated me.
Why don't you just admit it?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.985
Say it!

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:50.379
What the fuck is that?

01:26:53.077 --> 01:26:54.165
Holy shit!

01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:01.346
We have power?

01:27:04.393 --> 01:27:05.829
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

01:27:09.093 --> 01:27:11.791
Stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

01:27:14.707 --> 01:27:16.143
What are you
fuckin' lookin' at?

01:27:18.363 --> 01:27:19.843
Where the fuck
are you goin'?

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:23.194
You stop fuckin'
lookin' at me, all right?

01:27:47.566 --> 01:27:49.220
Stop fucking lookin' at me!

01:30:16.019 --> 01:30:17.194
You made it.
