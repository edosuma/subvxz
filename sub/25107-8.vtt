<i> Gob had been preparing</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:14.125
<i>for a parade illusion...</i>

00:14.208 --> 00:16.458
- Here it is.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.458
<i>-...to allow him to reunite</i>

00:16.541 --> 00:18.125
<i>with Tony Wonder.</i>

00:18.208 --> 00:20.708
Christian magician

00:18.208 --> 00:20.708
goes into one closet,

00:20.791 --> 00:23.583
gay magician into the other,

00:20.791 --> 00:23.583
they spin around,

00:23.666 --> 00:25.041
then you come out of the

00:23.666 --> 00:25.041
opposite closets, okay?

00:25.125 --> 00:29.041
Except now, he's straight

00:25.125 --> 00:29.041
and you're gay.

00:30.208 --> 00:32.625
You could go back and forth

00:30.208 --> 00:32.625
the whole parade.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.833
- I love it.

00:35.666 --> 00:37.833
- Yeah.

00:37.916 --> 00:41.958
But the big question is:

00:37.916 --> 00:41.958
will Tony? I mean, sometimes,

00:42.041 --> 00:44.708
I'm really into something,

00:42.041 --> 00:44.708
and he hates me.

00:44.791 --> 00:46.958
Well, there's

00:44.791 --> 00:46.958
only one way to know.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.291
<i>And so Gob called a man</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:53.541
<i>he had tried to forget</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:53.541
<i>by purchasing</i>

00:53.625 --> 00:55.208
<i>a closet conversion store</i>

00:53.625 --> 00:55.208
<i>in the first place.</i>

00:55.291 --> 00:56.458
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

00:56.541 --> 00:59.750
Yeah. Okay.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.208
Okay.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.833
Okay. Sure.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.708
- He's in.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.708
Yeah!

01:10.791 --> 01:12.916
And breathe a word about this

01:10.791 --> 01:12.916
to anybody and you're fired.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.208
<i>Lucille was visiting Buster</i>

01:43.083 --> 01:45.791
Five minutes.

01:51.416 --> 01:53.916
Well, I'm not going to be

01:51.416 --> 01:53.916
the one who apologizes,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.125
if that's what

01:54.000 --> 01:56.125
you're waiting for.

01:56.208 --> 01:59.333
- Well, I'm sorry, but...

01:56.208 --> 01:59.333
- Apology accepted.

01:59.416 --> 02:00.291
Uh...

02:00.375 --> 02:01.291
No, you said it.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.708
You said "I'm sorry."

02:02.791 --> 02:04.041
You said the words.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.166
Did I exaggerate about her?

02:07.250 --> 02:09.583
She really is just like the

02:07.250 --> 02:09.583
mother in <i> Two and a Half Men.</i>

02:10.333 --> 02:11.708
No, you did not.

02:11.791 --> 02:13.750
Start watching that show?

02:11.791 --> 02:13.750
Yes, I did, Mother.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.416
And you lied to me.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.500
There's no scary half-man

02:15.500 --> 02:18.500
that I couldn't handle.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.666
I don't approve of that show.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.041
Well, there's a lot

02:20.750 --> 02:22.041
of stuff I've done

02:22.125 --> 02:23.708
in this prison that you

02:22.125 --> 02:23.708
might not approve of.

02:23.791 --> 02:25.250
I touched a mouse.

02:25.333 --> 02:29.958
I read an illustrated Qur'an

02:25.333 --> 02:29.958
for kids, and at recess once,

02:30.041 --> 02:31.833
I sat in "Blacks only."

02:31.916 --> 02:33.083
Yard.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.750
Oh, I keep doing that.

02:34.833 --> 02:39.166
But maybe what you really

02:34.833 --> 02:39.166
don't approve of is... me.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.833
If you must know the truth,

02:39.250 --> 02:42.833
I'm not thrilled with you.

02:42.916 --> 02:44.666
- Okay.

02:42.916 --> 02:44.666
- The last time I saw you,

02:44.750 --> 02:47.625
you told me

02:44.750 --> 02:47.625
you didn't need me anymore.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.083
Okay... So I'm to believe

02:49.166 --> 02:52.291
that's what you're upset about?

02:52.375 --> 02:53.708
Not that you think

02:52.375 --> 02:53.708
I'm a murderer?

02:53.791 --> 02:55.333
Or that I touched a mouse?

02:55.416 --> 02:57.416
I happen to know for a fact

02:57.500 --> 02:59.166
-you're not a murderer.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.166
- What?

02:59.250 --> 03:01.458
Lucille 2's fine,

03:01.541 --> 03:04.333
but she can't

03:01.541 --> 03:04.333
come back right now.

03:04.416 --> 03:05.750
You know where she is?

03:05.833 --> 03:07.125
- I know who she's with,

03:07.208 --> 03:09.750
and that's all I can say.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.083
Why don't you say it to someone

03:09.833 --> 03:12.083
to get me out of here?

03:12.166 --> 03:13.916
I can't do that right now.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.666
You'll just have to

03:14.000 --> 03:15.666
sit tight and trust me

03:15.750 --> 03:17.291
for a little while longer.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.291
So it's like that again.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.791
History repeats.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.916
You remember that?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.375
I remember you paying me off

03:24.458 --> 03:27.291
by letting me go

03:24.458 --> 03:27.291
to the Fourth of July parade,

03:27.375 --> 03:29.750
but I'm a man now.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.041
Paying me off

03:29.833 --> 03:32.041
isn't gonna be that easy.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.750
You'll need the warden's

03:32.125 --> 03:34.750
permission, and then

03:34.833 --> 03:37.291
you'll have to sponsor me for

03:34.833 --> 03:37.291
my furlough, and they probably

03:37.375 --> 03:38.958
won't let me on the float again,

03:37.375 --> 03:38.958
but that's just...

03:39.041 --> 03:41.000
Oh, God, it's still

03:39.041 --> 03:41.000
the parade, isn't it?

03:41.083 --> 03:42.125
We're still talking about...

03:42.208 --> 03:44.041
Oh, we're talking about it!

03:44.125 --> 03:45.791
Buster, please.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.291
The parade's in two days.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.916
The whole city will be there.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.833
The last thing

03:49.000 --> 03:51.833
this family needs right now

03:51.916 --> 03:55.375
is a Bluth in a chain gang,

03:51.916 --> 03:55.375
picking up trash.

03:55.458 --> 03:58.166
Well, it's either that,

03:55.458 --> 03:58.166
or I'm gonna start spewing it.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.416
And your job's not gonna

03:58.250 --> 04:00.416
be easy since,

04:00.500 --> 04:03.208
of course, I got dinged because

04:00.500 --> 04:03.208
I screamed, "Turn it off!"

04:03.291 --> 04:05.166
after they showed the half-man.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.958
It's like they need another

04:05.250 --> 04:06.958
reason to call me...

04:07.041 --> 04:08.333
- Half-man?

04:07.041 --> 04:08.333
-...Jon Cryer.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.250
Oh.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.375
<i> Soon, George Michael</i>

04:10.791 --> 04:12.375
<i>sought out Maeby</i>

04:12.458 --> 04:13.750
<i>where she was living</i>

04:13.833 --> 04:15.208
<i>-as the sexagenarian Annette...</i>

04:13.833 --> 04:15.208
One minute!

04:15.291 --> 04:17.083
- It's me. It's me.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.083
- Oh, where are my glasses?

04:17.166 --> 04:19.416
Oh, they're right on top

04:17.166 --> 04:19.416
of my head, for God's sake.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.083
It's me. It's me.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.333
- Hey.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.333
- In. Come in.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.000
<i> ...who wasn't feeling</i>

04:23.416 --> 04:25.000
<i>very sexagenaric.</i>

04:25.083 --> 04:27.083
So, you're not gonna

04:25.083 --> 04:27.083
believe this...

04:27.166 --> 04:28.500
What are you doing?

04:28.583 --> 04:30.083
I'm doing another scrub and run.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.833
My sex date is tonight,

04:31.916 --> 04:33.375
and there's no

04:31.916 --> 04:33.375
other way out of it.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.041
And honestly,

04:33.458 --> 04:35.041
if I wanted a hairless lover,

04:35.125 --> 04:37.083
I'd probably go underage rather

04:35.125 --> 04:37.083
than overage, you know?

04:37.166 --> 04:39.583
- What's that?
- No, I mean, not

04:37.166 --> 04:39.583
that I would do it on purpose.

04:39.666 --> 04:41.416
I'm just saying if I had a gun

04:39.666 --> 04:41.416
to somebody's head.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.541
- If you had a...

04:41.500 --> 04:43.541
- What do you want me to do?

04:43.625 --> 04:46.291
You want me to shoot a kid?

04:43.625 --> 04:46.291
What kind of monster are you?

04:46.375 --> 04:48.166
I'm not sure how I became

04:46.375 --> 04:48.166
the monster there,

04:48.250 --> 04:50.208
but what happened to your plan

04:48.250 --> 04:50.208
to make Annette forgetful?

04:50.291 --> 04:53.291
Like, she can't keep track of

04:50.291 --> 04:53.291
things, to get out of the date?

04:53.375 --> 04:55.541
Well, it ended up having

04:53.375 --> 04:55.541
the opposite effect.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.916
<i> Because when Maeby</i>

04:55.625 --> 04:57.916
<i>showed up late,</i>

04:58.000 --> 05:00.416
<i>she saw something troubling.</i>

05:03.666 --> 05:04.958
Oh, what a relief.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.250
I thought you disappeared on me.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.875
Mwah. Thank God.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.125
Before I could

05:11.958 --> 05:13.125
even act confused,

05:13.208 --> 05:14.166
he had already called the cops.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.833
<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

05:15.916 --> 05:17.416
<i>- They weren't cops.</i>

05:15.916 --> 05:17.416
- This is wonderful.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.083
I've always wanted

05:17.500 --> 05:19.083
to be a Keystone Cop.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.666
It would be my honor to wear

05:19.166 --> 05:21.666
this handlebar mustache

05:21.750 --> 05:24.416
-in the 2nd of July parade.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.416
That's right.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.625
It's your first parade

05:24.500 --> 05:25.625
not playing the jailbird.

05:25.708 --> 05:26.666
So you should know,

05:26.750 --> 05:28.416
those can be tricky to stick on.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.750
Hey. I think I know

05:28.500 --> 05:30.750
what I'm doing.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.416
Kind of what I'm doing.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.416
<i> And these were, like,</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:34.416
<i>senior guys, you know?</i>

05:34.500 --> 05:38.333
Long coats. He's not

05:34.500 --> 05:38.333
gonna let her go,

05:38.416 --> 05:39.750
which means I have to.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.791
Good-bye, Annette.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.750
Good-bye to our teeth that

05:42.875 --> 05:45.750
make it look like I'm smiling

05:45.833 --> 05:47.208
so I don't have to.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.666
And you,

05:47.291 --> 05:49.666
I'll miss you most of all,

05:49.750 --> 05:52.750
neighbor's pain medication.

05:52.833 --> 05:55.208
I never even got the chance...

05:55.291 --> 05:58.083
Nah, I'll just take you with me.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.541
So, now that you found out

05:58.166 --> 06:00.541
your dad's sneaking around

06:00.625 --> 06:03.791
with your girlfriend, looks like

06:00.625 --> 06:03.791
you need a roommate, too, huh?

06:03.875 --> 06:05.416
No, that's what I came

06:03.875 --> 06:05.416
to talk to you about.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.291
He wasn't going

06:05.500 --> 06:07.291
to see Rebel in Mexico.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.833
The whole thing was just

06:07.375 --> 06:09.833
a crazy, paranoid idea.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.416
Who knows where we get

06:09.916 --> 06:11.416
these ideas from, right?

06:11.500 --> 06:14.208
Well, you. I got that from you.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.208
It's always from you.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.625
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say

06:14.291 --> 06:16.625
that sounded like one of mine.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.791
Yeah, so I was going down there

06:16.708 --> 06:18.791
to catch my father in this lie,

06:18.875 --> 06:20.416
and it turns out that I was

06:18.875 --> 06:20.416
the one caught in a lie,

06:20.500 --> 06:23.041
because there's a picture

06:20.500 --> 06:23.041
of the stair car in Mexico.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.916
<i> Something</i>

06:23.125 --> 06:24.916
<i>George Michael discovered</i>

06:25.000 --> 06:27.375

06:25.000 --> 06:27.375

06:27.458 --> 06:29.208
<i>on the way to purchasing</i>

06:27.458 --> 06:29.208
<i>12 new tires.</i>

06:29.291 --> 06:30.583
So, George Michael,

06:30.666 --> 06:32.875
<i>-why did you follow me</i>

06:30.666 --> 06:32.875
<i>down here?
- The truth?</i>

06:32.958 --> 06:35.291
I-I thought you were coming down

06:32.958 --> 06:35.291
here to meet Rebel.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.666
Come on, I'm so over Rebel.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.708
You were lying

06:37.750 --> 06:39.708
about so many other things,

06:39.791 --> 06:41.166
Pea Soup Andersen's

06:39.791 --> 06:41.166
and being at the barbecue...

06:41.250 --> 06:42.666
No, no, you're right.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.833
How about, starting right now,

06:42.750 --> 06:44.833
no more lies.

06:44.916 --> 06:47.083
That doesn't include me,

06:44.916 --> 06:47.083
though, does it?

06:47.166 --> 06:49.375
No, no, no. You'd be

06:47.166 --> 06:49.375
out of business, and by the way,

06:49.458 --> 06:50.833
Barry, you had

06:49.458 --> 06:50.833
the best lie of all,

06:50.916 --> 06:52.333
saying that they had a picture

06:52.416 --> 06:54.958
of-of Lucille 2 and Oscar

06:52.416 --> 06:54.958
in the stair car.

06:55.041 --> 07:00.041
That is not a lie. You said,

06:55.041 --> 07:00.041
"Keep it as real as possible."

07:00.125 --> 07:02.333
Prismo, texting mode.

07:02.416 --> 07:04.333
<i>Self-drive on.</i>

07:04.416 --> 07:06.083
This was real?

07:04.416 --> 07:06.083
If they've got this,

07:06.166 --> 07:08.333
there's no reason for them

07:06.166 --> 07:08.333
to hold Buster and they know it.

07:08.416 --> 07:10.500
- Did you know about this, Dad?

07:08.416 --> 07:10.500
Are you kidding?

07:10.583 --> 07:12.125
Thanks to your mother,

07:10.583 --> 07:12.125
I can't even feel

07:12.208 --> 07:15.916
-your son on my lap.

07:12.208 --> 07:15.916
- Can I see that, Dad?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.708
<i> Ugh, so Lucille 2</i>

07:16.000 --> 07:18.708
<i>is alive? Great.</i>

07:18.791 --> 07:20.875
Another reason I got to get

07:18.791 --> 07:20.875
the hell out of here.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.250
No, it wasn't her, it was us.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.125
From when we went to Mexico

07:22.333 --> 07:24.125
with Steve Holt.

07:24.208 --> 07:25.958
Don't you remember

07:24.208 --> 07:25.958
how we got there?

07:26.041 --> 07:27.958
<i>It was just after Cinco</i>

07:28.041 --> 07:29.708
<i>when Maeby suggested</i>

07:28.041 --> 07:29.708
<i>fleeing the country.</i>

07:29.791 --> 07:31.500
Screw it.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.500
No rules, anything goes.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.375
- Just the cousins.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.375
- Hey, why don't we take that?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.041
<i>Primos! </i>

07:39.125 --> 07:40.166
So anyway, now my dad

07:39.125 --> 07:40.166
and everyone else

07:40.250 --> 07:41.375
thinks that they have proof

07:41.458 --> 07:42.583
that's gonna exonerate Buster

07:42.666 --> 07:43.666
that I know isn't true.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.166
And I'm not sure

07:43.750 --> 07:45.166
whether I should...

07:45.250 --> 07:46.791
Lie to him.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.041
What do you think?

07:49.125 --> 07:51.833
Oh, okay. You just told me.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.833
Really?

07:51.916 --> 07:53.041
Even though we just left

07:53.125 --> 07:54.125
the stair car there

07:53.125 --> 07:54.125
when it broke down?

07:54.208 --> 07:55.875
I mean, what if they find it?

07:55.958 --> 07:57.833
I'm sure somebody got it working

07:55.958 --> 07:57.833
and it's long gone.

07:57.916 --> 08:01.041
And it's not like you're

07:57.916 --> 08:01.041
actually lying to your dad.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.833
You're just letting him believe

08:01.125 --> 08:03.833
something that isn't true.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.750
You know? Like how people

08:03.916 --> 08:06.750
think the world's melting

08:06.833 --> 08:08.250
because people drive cars,

08:08.333 --> 08:10.750
or that Hillary should

08:08.333 --> 08:10.750
continue to roam free.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.291
<i>And Maeby realized</i>

08:12.375 --> 08:14.583
<i>she had something else</i>

08:12.375 --> 08:14.583
<i>to say good-bye to.</i>

08:14.666 --> 08:17.791
Good-bye,<i> Fox &amp; Friends.</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:21.250
<i> Meanwhile, Lucille</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:21.250
<i>was growing concerned</i>

08:21.333 --> 08:22.500
<i>that her daughter Lindsay</i>

08:22.583 --> 08:24.125
<i>wouldn't be back in time</i>

08:22.583 --> 08:24.125
<i>for the parade.</i>

08:24.208 --> 08:25.625
<i> Sally, Sally,</i>

08:24.208 --> 08:25.625
<i>where are you headed?</i>

08:25.708 --> 08:28.333
<i>I think the more important</i>

08:25.708 --> 08:28.333
<i>question here is:</i>

08:28.416 --> 08:30.833
<i>where is my opponent,</i>

08:28.416 --> 08:30.833
<i>Lindsay Bluth?</i>

08:30.916 --> 08:33.625
<i>Maybe she's hiding behind</i>

08:30.916 --> 08:33.625
<i>this wall she wants to build.</i>

08:33.707 --> 08:35.666
<i>If she does indeed</i>

08:33.707 --> 08:35.666
<i>show up at the parade,</i>

08:35.750 --> 08:40.000
<i>I will be very surprised,</i>

08:35.750 --> 08:40.000
<i>though I may not look it.</i>

08:40.082 --> 08:41.791
<i>- No further questions.</i>

08:41.875 --> 08:43.666
- Hey, hey.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.958
Oh, George,

08:43.750 --> 08:45.958
I've been worried sick.

08:46.041 --> 08:50.041
About Buster being stuck

08:46.041 --> 08:50.041
in-in that jail.

08:50.125 --> 08:54.041
They are making him a patsy,

08:50.125 --> 08:54.041
parading him around,

08:54.125 --> 08:56.791
frightening the masses

08:54.125 --> 08:56.791
before the Fourth of July.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.583
It's on the second this year.

08:58.666 --> 09:02.958
And being in the parade was

08:58.666 --> 09:02.958
his idea, like it was in 1982.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.250
We're trying to get

09:03.041 --> 09:05.250
Lindsay elected,

09:05.333 --> 09:06.833
and Buster wants everyone

09:05.333 --> 09:06.833
in the world

09:06.916 --> 09:09.208
to see him in

09:06.916 --> 09:09.208
an orange jumpsuit.

09:09.291 --> 09:12.000
- So he'll be out in public?

09:09.291 --> 09:12.000
- I don't want to tell you

09:12.083 --> 09:15.000
what I had to give the warden

09:12.083 --> 09:15.000
to make that happen.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.250
I don't want to hear it.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.083
Meanwhile, we still

09:16.333 --> 09:18.083
don't have a Lindsay,

09:18.166 --> 09:20.041
and Sally is calling us

09:18.166 --> 09:20.041
out about it.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.916
We've got this elaborate float

09:20.125 --> 09:22.916
to help distract from the fact

09:23.000 --> 09:24.708
that there's

09:23.000 --> 09:24.708
no stair car this year,

09:24.791 --> 09:26.500
-and nobody to put on it.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.083
- Ugh, God.<i> -Fortunately,</i>

09:26.583 --> 09:29.083
<i>Tobias was finally calling.</i>

09:29.166 --> 09:30.541
Oh, thank God, it's Tobias.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.416
You better have found

09:32.833 --> 09:34.416
my daughter.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.583
Sally is now in the race,

09:34.500 --> 09:36.583
and she's pointing out

09:36.666 --> 09:38.708
that no one has seen

09:36.666 --> 09:38.708
Lindsay in a week.

09:38.791 --> 09:40.750
Yes. I didn't want

09:38.791 --> 09:40.750
to get your hopes up,

09:40.833 --> 09:42.875
<i>but I'm in Mexico</i>

09:40.833 --> 09:42.875
<i>and I have found Lindsay...</i>

09:42.958 --> 09:44.875
- Oh, thank God.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.875
<i>-...to be very stubborn.</i>

09:44.958 --> 09:46.125
<i>Oh, damn it,</i>

09:46.208 --> 09:48.250
I just did exactly

09:46.208 --> 09:48.250
what I said I wouldn't do.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.791
Anyway, I'm at Ma Bark's,

09:49.875 --> 09:52.583
and she tells me Lindsay

09:49.875 --> 09:52.583
should be back this afternoon,

09:52.666 --> 09:54.958
before I'm out of my

09:52.666 --> 09:54.958
postal plumage. Of course,

09:55.041 --> 09:56.083
when she does come back,

09:56.166 --> 09:58.000
I'll still need to get her

09:56.166 --> 09:58.000
into the car.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.625
Well, say whatever you need to.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.416
<i>Yes. I was thinking</i>

09:59.708 --> 10:01.416
<i>I would just say,</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:03.708
"Your mother is so sorry

10:01.500 --> 10:03.708
she upset you."

10:03.791 --> 10:05.166
Out of the question.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.208
Yes. It felt

10:05.250 --> 10:08.208
a little out of character.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.250
<i>How about I just</i>

10:08.291 --> 10:10.250
<i>make it about me?</i>

10:10.333 --> 10:12.541
"It's incredibly important

10:10.333 --> 10:12.541
to me and my life..."

10:12.625 --> 10:15.041
Where is this going?

10:15.125 --> 10:16.500
"...and if you do this for me,

10:16.583 --> 10:18.250
"I'm sure Lucille

10:16.583 --> 10:18.250
will make me permanent member

10:18.333 --> 10:19.708
of the Bluth family."

10:19.791 --> 10:21.875
That way, you're not

10:19.791 --> 10:21.875
lying to Lindsay...

10:21.958 --> 10:25.375
You are. Well, that sounds

10:21.958 --> 10:25.375
like the best

10:25.458 --> 10:28.333
of our diplomatic options,

10:28.416 --> 10:30.250
but you're in Mexico,

10:28.416 --> 10:30.250
for God's sake.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.541
Please tell me you prepared

10:30.333 --> 10:33.541
a few "against her wills."

10:33.625 --> 10:36.750
Oh, my gosh.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.750
I do miss that wit, Mother.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.166
It's Mrs. Bluth.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.166
I wasn't joking.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.250
And you're right,

10:39.250 --> 10:41.250
we need her standing,

10:41.333 --> 10:44.125
<i>and dressed and ready</i>

10:41.333 --> 10:44.125
<i>for the parade.</i>

10:44.208 --> 10:47.416
On it. In the meantime, wow,

10:44.208 --> 10:47.416
what a trip!

10:47.500 --> 10:49.166
Murphybrown saw an armadillo,

10:49.250 --> 10:51.833
men held us up at gunpoint,

10:49.250 --> 10:51.833
and I got to dress up

10:51.916 --> 10:53.333
<i>-as an os...</i>

10:53.416 --> 10:55.250
<i> It would be five</i>

10:53.416 --> 10:55.250
<i>minutes before he would realize</i>

10:55.333 --> 10:57.625
<i>she was no longer on the phone.</i>

10:57.708 --> 11:00.708
<i>And, as Tobias awaited</i>

10:57.708 --> 11:00.708
<i>bringing Lindsay home,</i>

11:00.791 --> 11:03.250
<i>Maeby was reluctantly</i>

11:00.791 --> 11:03.250
<i>leaving hers.</i>

11:03.333 --> 11:05.500
You're Annette's granddaughter,

11:03.333 --> 11:05.500
aren't you?

11:05.583 --> 11:07.791
Yeah, I am.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.416
I'm getting out of here.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.875
Saying good-bye to her.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.500
Well, she's in good hands.

11:12.583 --> 11:15.166
Stan would do anything

11:12.583 --> 11:15.166
for your grandmother.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.416
If that woman told him

11:15.250 --> 11:18.416
to jump off a bridge, he would.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.208
He would, wouldn't he?

11:21.291 --> 11:23.916
<i> And she found herself</i>

11:21.291 --> 11:23.916
<i>feeling reflective.</i>

11:31.583 --> 11:33.083
Nah, I love this place.

11:33.166 --> 11:34.833
I'll just tell him it's over,

11:33.166 --> 11:34.833
and kick him out.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.666
<i>It was the 2nd of July,</i>

11:39.750 --> 11:41.291
<i>and the Funkes</i>

11:39.750 --> 11:41.291
<i>had just finished</i>

11:41.375 --> 11:44.541
<i>working off their water</i>

11:41.375 --> 11:44.541
<i>and phone debt.</i>

11:44.625 --> 11:46.000
I guess you earned your shower.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.833
Ugh. This thing

11:46.083 --> 11:48.833
does not breathe.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.541
I'll tell you who doesn't bitch

11:48.916 --> 11:51.541
like that, your son.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.458
I'll give you 500 bucks cash

11:53.541 --> 11:55.750
for this youngin' right now.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.333
<i> And maybe that's</i>

11:55.833 --> 11:58.333
<i>when Tobias learned</i>

11:58.416 --> 12:00.500
<i>what it meant to be a father.</i>

12:19.833 --> 12:22.583
My son is not for sale.

12:22.666 --> 12:24.041
Thanks, Dad.

12:24.125 --> 12:26.125
Then shower's off.

12:24.125 --> 12:26.125
There's your wife.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.375
Now you can both go.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.416
Lindsay?

12:30.666 --> 12:33.458
- Tobias?

12:30.666 --> 12:33.458
- DeBrie?

12:33.541 --> 12:36.916
No, you were right

12:33.541 --> 12:36.916
the first time. Uh...

12:37.000 --> 12:38.666
I've been

12:37.000 --> 12:38.666
pretending to be Lindsay

12:38.750 --> 12:41.541
the past few months, on account

12:38.750 --> 12:41.541
of Marky's face blind.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.416
But Marky's buying it.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.458
You should hear him: "Oh,

12:43.500 --> 12:45.458
Lindsay, you've let yourself go.

12:45.541 --> 12:48.666
Oh, Lindsay,

12:45.541 --> 12:48.666
why'd you stop showering?"

12:48.750 --> 12:50.666
You're missing

12:48.750 --> 12:50.666
some back teeth, there.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.708
Yeah. Just like that.

12:52.791 --> 12:54.708
But I don't think

12:52.791 --> 12:54.708
I can be Lindsay anymore.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.250
They're so critical.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.166
And...

12:56.333 --> 12:59.166
I fall apart at criticism.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.583
And Marky doesn't see me

12:59.250 --> 13:02.583
for who I really am.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.166
I see you for who you are.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.250
DeBrie Bardeaux.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.125
A first-class Lindsay Bluth

13:06.333 --> 13:08.125
impersonator.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.208
Now, let's go to Newport Beach,

13:08.208 --> 13:10.208
and you can be Lindsay there.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.708
- Oh, I can't go back to Newport,

13:12.791 --> 13:14.916
'cause that's where Marky's

13:12.791 --> 13:14.916
headed right now,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.333
to protest the 2nd of July

13:15.000 --> 13:18.333
parade with a paint bomb.

13:21.291 --> 13:22.541
- You know what?

13:22.625 --> 13:24.333
I could go to Newport.

13:24.416 --> 13:26.583
- Let's do it.
- NARRATOR:

13:24.416 --> 13:26.583
<i>And soon, preparations</i>

13:26.666 --> 13:27.583
<i>for the 2nd of July parade</i>

13:27.666 --> 13:29.583
<i>were underway.</i>

13:29.666 --> 13:31.500
We're 20 minutes from float-off.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.750
Ugh, but at least

13:31.583 --> 13:32.750
nobody's noticed

13:32.833 --> 13:34.750
that the stair car's not here.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.500
<i>And that's when Sally</i>

13:34.833 --> 13:37.500
<i>arrived in a float</i>

13:37.583 --> 13:39.125
<i>that would make sure</i>

13:37.583 --> 13:39.125
<i>they did notice.</i>

13:39.208 --> 13:41.125
Oh, hello.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.875
What do you think

13:41.208 --> 13:42.875
of the new stair car?

13:42.958 --> 13:44.666
I had to make one,

13:42.958 --> 13:44.666
because yours disappeared.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.791
Sally Sitwell.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.875
Well, you're no stranger

13:46.875 --> 13:48.875
to stuffing tissue places

13:48.958 --> 13:50.291
when you don't have the goods.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.208
Well, what we don't have

13:50.375 --> 13:52.208
is the candidate

13:52.291 --> 13:54.208
that would've been

13:52.291 --> 13:54.208
Lindsay's opponent.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.916
But we made one,

13:54.291 --> 13:55.916
and put her up top.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.208
Although, she's not

13:56.000 --> 13:59.208
as hollow as your candidate.

13:59.291 --> 14:00.583
Uh, where is she?

14:00.666 --> 14:02.041
Uh, she went off somewhere

14:00.666 --> 14:02.041
to pretty herself up

14:02.125 --> 14:03.166
for the parade.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.500
Aren't you in it, too?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.750
Ticktock.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.333
The sun is nobody's friend.

14:08.416 --> 14:12.500
Speaking of which, where is that

14:08.416 --> 14:12.500
friendless son of yours,

14:12.583 --> 14:13.875
Buster?

14:13.958 --> 14:15.583
Is it true he's in prison?

14:15.666 --> 14:18.541
Well, yes,

14:15.666 --> 14:18.541
in the Keystone Cops skit

14:18.625 --> 14:20.500
in your father's old role.

14:20.583 --> 14:23.333
<i>Something Buster</i>

14:20.583 --> 14:23.333
<i>had only discovered</i>

14:23.416 --> 14:24.750
<i>-moments earlier. </i>-Mr. Bluth,

14:23.416 --> 14:24.750
you're not on cleaning detail.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.333
What?

14:26.416 --> 14:30.041
Is this because I accidentally

14:26.416 --> 14:30.041
choked Ron Howard?

14:30.125 --> 14:31.750
Because they already

14:30.125 --> 14:31.750
made me pay for that.

14:31.833 --> 14:32.916
They chopped your hand off?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.458
No, they just downgraded me

14:33.000 --> 14:35.458
to a manual.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.291
Listen,

14:35.541 --> 14:38.291
I don't mean to namedrop,

14:38.375 --> 14:40.791
but Mother was supposed to have

14:38.375 --> 14:40.791
already arranged for me

14:40.875 --> 14:42.083
to follow the parade.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.333
Sorry.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.750
I got a note

14:43.416 --> 14:44.750
from the warden himself.

14:44.833 --> 14:47.833
You're in a cage

14:44.833 --> 14:47.833
on a Keystone Cop float.

14:47.916 --> 14:49.875
What?

14:49.958 --> 14:51.375
You mean I'm in the parade?

14:51.458 --> 14:54.375
Are there dressing rooms

14:51.458 --> 14:54.375
for the talent?

14:54.458 --> 14:55.958
Oh, well, at least

14:54.458 --> 14:55.958
Buster's being held.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.750
Which is more

14:56.041 --> 14:58.750
than he had as a child.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.958
<i> Sally wasn't</i>

14:58.833 --> 15:00.958
<i>that sweet after all.</i>

15:01.041 --> 15:04.083
When this is all over,

15:01.041 --> 15:04.083
let's get coffee.

15:06.958 --> 15:09.250
<i>And Tobias made sure his son</i>

15:06.958 --> 15:09.250
<i>was occupied</i>

15:09.333 --> 15:11.291
<i>while DeBrie prepared</i>

15:09.333 --> 15:11.291
<i>for her role as Lindsay.</i>

15:11.375 --> 15:12.375
I will leave you here

15:12.458 --> 15:14.166
and what could be more exciting

15:14.250 --> 15:15.625
than to be backstage

15:15.708 --> 15:19.041
♪ At a parade? ♪

15:19.125 --> 15:21.583
♪ ...ade. ♪

15:21.666 --> 15:25.000
♪ Being watching the parade. ♪

15:25.083 --> 15:26.666
No. With the curb huggers? No.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.541
I meant, for one whose dream

15:26.750 --> 15:29.541
it is to be a clown.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.458
Oh, yeah, 'cause he'd be, like,

15:31.541 --> 15:35.250
"This is the one place where I'm

15:31.541 --> 15:35.250
not embarrassed of my dream."

15:35.333 --> 15:38.750
Hey, no. Never apologize

15:35.333 --> 15:38.750
for your dream.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.083
No. I was-I was

15:38.833 --> 15:41.083
making fun of the guy.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.500
What guy?

15:42.583 --> 15:44.875
Whose dream...

15:42.583 --> 15:44.875
whose dream it is.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.333
It's your dream.

15:46.416 --> 15:47.750
We just talked about dreams,

15:47.833 --> 15:50.541
and you said you could unicycle

15:47.833 --> 15:50.541
and juggle.

15:50.625 --> 15:53.125
Oh! That's because my uncle,

15:53.208 --> 15:55.541
he taught me that stuff,

15:53.208 --> 15:55.541
when he used to come over

15:55.625 --> 15:57.375
to cheer me up on Father's Day.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.625
Robbie knows how to juggle?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.125
Who's Robbie?

16:01.208 --> 16:03.666
Oh. Yes, of course.

16:03.750 --> 16:04.916
You wouldn't know my brother.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.750
Are you one

16:05.000 --> 16:07.750
of our parade clowns?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.750
Me? No, I'm too shy.

16:09.833 --> 16:12.083
No... yes, yes, he...

16:09.833 --> 16:12.083
yes, he is. Yes.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.791
T-This is, uh, Relucto,

16:12.166 --> 16:14.791
the apprehensive clown.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.416
No, I'm not, where do you...

16:16.500 --> 16:17.916
There's the catchphrase.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.083
Let's get you into a chair.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.541
Well, I-I bet right now,

16:21.625 --> 16:23.791
there's a very, very jealous fan

16:21.625 --> 16:23.791
out there who would-who would

16:23.875 --> 16:27.375
give anything to-to trade places

16:23.875 --> 16:27.375
with you and get up on that...

16:27.458 --> 16:29.208
No, I can't,

16:27.458 --> 16:29.208
because I have to be her husband

16:29.291 --> 16:31.000
in that stupid Lindsay float.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.500
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.500
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was</i>

16:33.583 --> 16:35.500
<i>second-guessing his float,</i>

16:35.583 --> 16:38.041
<i>as he waited for Tony Wonder,</i>

16:35.583 --> 16:38.041
<i>who had yet to show up.</i>

16:38.125 --> 16:39.875
- Aw, damn it!

16:38.125 --> 16:39.875
- Hey, Gob, have you seen Mom?

16:39.958 --> 16:42.291
No. Um, hey, how would you

16:39.958 --> 16:42.291
like to help me

16:42.375 --> 16:44.500
in a double-closet

16:42.375 --> 16:44.500
sexuality switch

16:44.583 --> 16:45.958
two-hander float illusion,

16:46.041 --> 16:48.541
no credit, no money?

16:46.041 --> 16:48.541
Oh, and you turn gay.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.833
- I'll pass.
- Yeah, that's what

16:48.625 --> 16:50.833
I thought of you.

16:50.916 --> 16:52.291
Look, we're gonna pull out

16:50.916 --> 16:52.291
of here in five minutes,

16:52.375 --> 16:53.500
and Tony's not here;

16:52.375 --> 16:53.500
what if he doesn't show?

16:53.583 --> 16:54.916
Gob, you'll be fine.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.083
Do you remember

16:55.000 --> 16:56.083
high school commencement,

16:56.166 --> 16:57.458
when they asked you

16:56.166 --> 16:57.458
to represent all the kids

16:57.541 --> 16:59.458
that were being left back,

16:57.541 --> 16:59.458
and then you had

16:59.541 --> 17:00.500
to quickly find

16:59.541 --> 17:00.500
a replacement for Buster

17:00.583 --> 17:02.375
who was too afraid

17:00.583 --> 17:02.375
to be sawed in half?

17:02.458 --> 17:03.666
So you're saying nothing's worse

17:03.750 --> 17:05.415
than the sound

17:03.750 --> 17:05.415
of the dog screaming?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.333
No, I just meant you're not

17:05.500 --> 17:07.333
a very good magician.

17:07.415 --> 17:11.125
<i>And that's when Gob noticed</i>

17:07.415 --> 17:11.125
<i>a less discerning brother,</i>

17:11.208 --> 17:14.458
<i>who also happened to be his</i>

17:11.208 --> 17:14.458
<i>former magician's assistant.</i>

17:14.540 --> 17:15.833
Hey.

17:15.915 --> 17:18.750
- Hey.

17:15.915 --> 17:18.750
- Oh.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.833
- Sup. Listen,

17:18.833 --> 17:20.833
I'm glad you're here.
- Sup...

17:20.915 --> 17:22.333
I might need you to fill in

17:20.915 --> 17:22.333
for Tony Wonder

17:22.415 --> 17:23.958
-in my illusion.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.958
- Mm.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.458
It's gonna involve you

17:24.040 --> 17:25.458
being put into a small,

17:25.540 --> 17:27.290
confined space,

17:25.540 --> 17:27.290
and you come out gay.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.875
If that's a swipe about me being

17:27.375 --> 17:30.875
in prison, I understand it.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.500
Oh, right, you're in prison.

17:32.583 --> 17:33.750
What are you doing here?

17:33.833 --> 17:35.083
Well, Mom arranged it.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.958
Although, it is nice

17:35.166 --> 17:36.958
to be able to see family again,

17:37.041 --> 17:38.750
because, not to be rude,

17:38.833 --> 17:40.500
-but you didn't visit me in...

17:38.833 --> 17:40.500
- Oh, there's a dog.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.958
<i>And Tobias and a nervous DeBrie</i>

17:43.041 --> 17:45.000
<i>approached Lucille</i>

17:43.041 --> 17:45.000
<i>to pitch their deception.</i>

17:45.083 --> 17:48.000
Tobias, and if it isn't...

17:45.083 --> 17:48.000
what is it again?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.833
- LeTrasha?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.833
- Hello, again.

17:49.916 --> 17:53.666
Those last few teeth aren't

17:49.916 --> 17:53.666
going without a fight, are they?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.958
- Mm, thank you.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.958
- So where's Lindsay?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.166
- You said you had Lindsay.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.166
Yes.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.541
But it turned out to be the

17:58.250 --> 18:00.541
professional actress DeBrie.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.291
The only acting this one's

18:00.625 --> 18:03.291
good at is feigning interest

18:03.375 --> 18:05.208
in her drug dealer's hobbies.

18:05.291 --> 18:08.208
You do see a lot of aquariums.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.208
But she was coming off

18:08.291 --> 18:11.208
a three-month run as Lindsay

18:11.291 --> 18:15.250
in front of a sold-out audience

18:11.291 --> 18:15.250
of one face blind man.

18:15.333 --> 18:19.041
The point is, if she can fool

18:15.333 --> 18:19.041
him, why not have her violate

18:19.125 --> 18:20.916
federal election guidelines

18:19.125 --> 18:20.916
by fooling

18:21.000 --> 18:23.875
the entire electorate

18:21.000 --> 18:23.875
as the next representative

18:23.958 --> 18:27.708
of the great 48th congressional

18:23.958 --> 18:27.708
district of Californ-i-ay?

18:27.791 --> 18:30.500
Upon a float where, unless

18:27.791 --> 18:30.500
she gives a perfect performance,

18:30.583 --> 18:32.916
she goes to jail for fraud.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.750
Fine. You've left me no choice.

18:34.833 --> 18:37.000
Maybe if you turn away

18:34.833 --> 18:37.000
from the bleachers

18:37.083 --> 18:39.583
and cover your face

18:37.083 --> 18:39.583
with your hand...

18:39.666 --> 18:42.791
I'm sure that's not the first

18:39.666 --> 18:42.791
time you've been told that.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.375
Oh, God, no.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.791
I can't do this. T-This is...

18:45.875 --> 18:47.041
No, no, no.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.041
-...why I gave this up.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.416
DeBRIE: Shy.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.416
- No. No, you can.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.833
- You can do this.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.833
- No.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.625
- No, no, no. Shy.

18:49.916 --> 18:51.625
- You can't be this critical.

18:51.708 --> 18:53.250
Not too shy, not shy.

18:51.708 --> 18:53.250
No... happy, good.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.041
(announcer

18:55.125 --> 18:57.375
Good, happy, not sad.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.375
Don't worry, Lucille.

18:57.458 --> 18:58.833
I've got this covered.

18:58.916 --> 19:00.208
I... no, no, no. Shy.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.375
- Sad, shy. Sad...

19:00.291 --> 19:02.375
- Just get her up there!

19:02.458 --> 19:04.416
<i>And so, the parade</i>

19:02.458 --> 19:04.416
<i>finally began.</i>

19:04.500 --> 19:06.208
<i>Although, "finally" might</i>

19:04.500 --> 19:06.208
<i>not be the right word,</i>

19:06.291 --> 19:10.083
<i>because it was still two days</i>

19:06.291 --> 19:10.083
<i>before the Fourth of July,</i>

19:10.166 --> 19:13.958
<i>and one day before the big</i>

19:10.166 --> 19:13.958
<i>fireworks show on the 3rd.</i>

19:14.041 --> 19:17.500
Welcome to the third annual 2nd

19:14.041 --> 19:17.500
of July Fourth of July parade.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.791
To start the festivities,

19:17.583 --> 19:19.791
please welcome

19:19.875 --> 19:21.666
the Milford Academy

19:19.875 --> 19:21.666
marching band,

19:21.750 --> 19:23.000
known throughout the state

19:23.083 --> 19:25.750
as California's

19:23.083 --> 19:25.750
quietest marching band.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.666
Let's all be perfectly still

19:25.833 --> 19:28.666
and see if we can hear them.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.708
("You're a Grand Old Flag"

19:45.208 --> 19:47.000
There you are.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.041
<i>And Michael finally caught up</i>

19:49.125 --> 19:50.750
<i>-with his mother.</i>

19:49.125 --> 19:50.750
- Hello, Mother.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.750
Michael.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.708
Please tell me you're back,

19:52.833 --> 19:55.708
no one new has been arrested

19:55.791 --> 19:58.375
and that your father is on

19:55.791 --> 19:58.375
the way, but first, a kiss.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.625
- Hmm.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.625
- There are cameras everywhere.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.041
Well, that... something

20:01.708 --> 20:04.041
you ought to have thought of

20:04.125 --> 20:08.083
with regard to Lucille 2

20:04.125 --> 20:08.083
and Oscar in Mexico.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.750
I can't believe they

20:08.166 --> 20:09.750
were so stupid as to flee town

20:09.833 --> 20:12.416
-in the stair car.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.416
- Mm-hmm. Mom?

20:12.500 --> 20:15.416
Come on, you knew

20:12.500 --> 20:15.416
that Lucille 2 was with Oscar,

20:15.500 --> 20:17.125
and you let your son sit

20:15.500 --> 20:17.125
in prison

20:17.208 --> 20:18.833
instead of telling anyone.

20:18.916 --> 20:21.166
Knew? Michael, I can't...

20:21.250 --> 20:24.333
I mean, the thought

20:21.250 --> 20:24.333
that I wouldn't run to the D.A.

20:24.416 --> 20:25.750
the moment I...

20:24.416 --> 20:25.750
- Mom. Please.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.833
Do you have a tissue?

20:27.916 --> 20:29.958
You haven't needed a tissue

20:27.916 --> 20:29.958
since Nixon resigned.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.666
I think that you asked Oscar

20:31.750 --> 20:33.541
to take her out of town,

20:31.750 --> 20:33.541
didn't you?

20:33.625 --> 20:34.750
I think that you needed her

20:33.625 --> 20:34.750
out of the country

20:34.833 --> 20:36.166
so that you could, what?

20:36.250 --> 20:38.625
- Plunder her business?

20:36.250 --> 20:38.625
- Now, listen,

20:38.708 --> 20:41.291
nobody was hurt, everybody's

20:38.708 --> 20:41.291
getting what they deserve.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.750
Buster's in prison.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.416
No, he's in a parade.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.458
He's just playing a prisoner.

20:47.541 --> 20:50.166
At least, that's what it looks

20:47.541 --> 20:50.166
like to everyone here.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.875
Look, I did what I had to do

20:50.250 --> 20:53.875
to save this family.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.958
There are things

20:53.958 --> 20:55.958
you don't understand.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.541
But he'll be out soon.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.166
I did three years in prison

20:57.625 --> 21:00.166
because of Buster.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.708
- He can do a few weeks for me.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.708
- Well, guess what?

21:02.791 --> 21:04.375
He's gonna be out a little bit

21:02.791 --> 21:04.375
sooner than you think,

21:04.458 --> 21:06.166
because I'm gonna go

21:04.458 --> 21:06.166
to Lottie Dottie,

21:06.250 --> 21:07.791
and I'm gonna call her

21:06.250 --> 21:07.791
on this photo.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.250
Michael, you stay away

21:07.875 --> 21:09.250
from that D.A.

21:09.333 --> 21:12.416
She's a killer,

21:09.333 --> 21:12.416
despite what she may seem.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.916
So, there's nothing you can do.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.625
The D.A.'s office is closed

21:15.000 --> 21:17.625
until after the 5th.

21:17.708 --> 21:21.208
Now, please. We're family.

21:21.291 --> 21:24.208
You stay out of my life,

21:21.291 --> 21:24.208
I'll stay out of yours.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.875
Hmm.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.083
Thank you! Thank you!

21:27.166 --> 21:29.291
I guess there is nothing

21:27.166 --> 21:29.291
that I can do, Mom.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.375
<i>You know, I-I have to believe...</i>

21:33.458 --> 21:34.458
<i>I'm-I'm not sure that, uh...</i>

21:34.541 --> 21:35.541
<i>Yes?</i>

21:35.625 --> 21:36.875
<i>I've just been given</i>

21:35.625 --> 21:36.875
<i>the signal.</i>

21:36.958 --> 21:37.916
Uh, the band

21:36.958 --> 21:37.916
is finished playing.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.958
Ah, well, that's terrific.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.416
I'm sure they were great.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.750
Let's-let's give them

21:40.500 --> 21:41.750
all a big hand.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.000
Oh, it might be

21:41.833 --> 21:43.000
too late for that.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.791
Looks like their van

21:43.083 --> 21:45.791
just pulled out.

21:45.875 --> 21:49.458
They will be neither

21:45.875 --> 21:49.458
seen nor heard next year.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.250
<i>As it turned out...</i>

21:51.333 --> 21:53.166
<i>Lottie Dottie</i>

21:51.333 --> 21:53.166
<i>was heavily guarded.</i>

21:53.250 --> 21:55.458
<i>And that's when Michael,</i>

21:55.541 --> 21:58.208
<i>who had done some light</i>

21:55.541 --> 21:58.208
<i>unicycling in college,</i>

21:58.291 --> 22:00.416
<i>came up with a plan</i>

21:58.291 --> 22:00.416
<i>that just might make it</i>

22:00.500 --> 22:02.458
<i>seem like he was part</i>

22:00.500 --> 22:02.458
<i>of the parade.</i>

22:02.541 --> 22:03.458
Hi. Excuse me?

22:03.541 --> 22:04.916
- Do you mind if I...

22:03.541 --> 22:04.916
if I just...
- Aah!

22:05.000 --> 22:06.916
<i>- Although a less complicated</i>

22:05.000 --> 22:06.916
<i>plan emerged. </i>-Um...

22:07.000 --> 22:08.291
<i>Looks like the D.A. guards</i>

22:08.375 --> 22:09.583
<i>are leaving their post</i>

22:08.375 --> 22:09.583
<i>to tend to him.</i>

22:09.666 --> 22:11.666
This is gonna be

22:09.666 --> 22:11.666
less humiliating.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.500
- Hi. Excuse me, Lottie!

22:13.583 --> 22:15.125
Mrs. Dottie, I'm Michael Bluth.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.250
Do you mind if I just parade

22:15.208 --> 22:17.250
with you for, uh, just a minute?

22:17.333 --> 22:19.125
Oh, you must be

22:17.333 --> 22:19.125
Buster's brother. Hop in.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.458
I am Buster's brother. Yes.

22:20.541 --> 22:22.125
Oh, so how can I help you?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.708
And please make sure to wave.

22:23.791 --> 22:26.458
Huh? Yes. Hi.

22:26.541 --> 22:29.250
Um, so, does the D.A.'s office

22:26.541 --> 22:29.250
make a regular practice

22:29.333 --> 22:30.625
of holding people under

22:29.333 --> 22:30.625
suspicion of murdering victims

22:30.708 --> 22:32.166
that are clearly still alive?

22:32.250 --> 22:34.625
- Huh?
- We're not holding him

22:32.250 --> 22:34.625
on murder charges.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.666
It's a tampering case, right?

22:36.750 --> 22:39.583
Yeah, well, if there's no crime,

22:36.750 --> 22:39.583
then what has he tampered with?

22:39.666 --> 22:41.166
Lucille Austero's clearly alive

22:41.250 --> 22:43.166
after the moment

22:41.250 --> 22:43.166
that she disappeared.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.500
You know?

22:43.250 --> 22:44.500
That-that's my uncle Oscar.

22:44.583 --> 22:45.958
My-my mother just confirmed it.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.875
Oh. And we couldn't

22:46.041 --> 22:48.875
find him, either,

22:48.958 --> 22:51.791
so the missing victim

22:48.958 --> 22:51.791
and the alibi

22:51.875 --> 22:54.416
and what we thought

22:51.875 --> 22:54.416
was the scene of the crime.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.375
Yes. All here.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.375
All in one picture.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.416
Oh, my God.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.416
This is so embarrassing.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.541
I mean, what can I do?

22:59.500 --> 23:01.541
How can I make this right?

23:01.625 --> 23:03.125
Well, you gotta, you gotta

23:01.625 --> 23:03.125
release my brother from prison.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.375
- We did.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.375
- Hmm?

23:04.458 --> 23:06.583
- You did?
- I mean, it has

23:04.458 --> 23:06.583
to be processed out,

23:06.666 --> 23:08.041
but he wanted to be in a parade.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.833
Oh. Well,

23:08.125 --> 23:09.833
he looks to be enjoying himself.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.916
Okay, well, I'm glad that

23:09.916 --> 23:11.916
we talked this through, though.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.916
You know? This...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.916
I'm so glad to have met you.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.125
- Yeah?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.125
- I guess I should say I'm lucky

23:15.208 --> 23:18.125
I didn't have to face you

23:15.208 --> 23:18.125
in a court of law.

23:18.208 --> 23:19.333
Maybe someday we will.

23:19.416 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, I mean, if it turns out

23:21.083 --> 23:23.458
that's not really Oscar

23:21.083 --> 23:23.458
and Lucille in the picture.

23:23.541 --> 23:26.416
- Right. Yes. And you find

23:23.541 --> 23:26.416
a crime scene.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.375
I-I've injured a clown.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.375
You don't want to hurt a clown.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.000
So I'm gonna go back

23:29.458 --> 23:31.000
and I'm gonna help the clown.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.333
- Good-bye

23:31.083 --> 23:32.333
- Be careful.

23:32.416 --> 23:34.458
Oh!

23:34.541 --> 23:37.916
Next up is a double-closet

23:34.541 --> 23:37.916
sexuality switch

23:38.000 --> 23:39.916
two-hander float illusion,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.375
brought to you by our friends

23:40.000 --> 23:42.375

No?

Oh, forget it.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.916
So, I guess, happy 4th.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.916
Nah, well...

23:59.041 --> 24:00.958
Well, the magician

23:59.041 --> 24:00.958
seems to be

24:01.041 --> 24:02.958
just standing there,

24:01.041 --> 24:02.958

24:13.833 --> 24:15.333
- "wonder"?

24:15.416 --> 24:16.833
Tony?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.666
You sinner.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.750
He's Gob,

24:19.750 --> 24:22.750
the Christian magician.

24:22.833 --> 24:26.875
And he's Tony Wonder,

24:22.833 --> 24:26.875
the hot gay one.

24:26.958 --> 24:29.208
And as a Christian magician,

24:29.291 --> 24:33.083
I know that gay people

24:29.291 --> 24:33.083
can change.

24:33.166 --> 24:37.041
And as the hot gay one,

31:21.416 --> 31:22.458
and be straight with her

31:21.416 --> 31:22.458
about this.

31:22.541 --> 31:24.000
Should I tell her

31:22.541 --> 31:24.000
that my son and my niece

31:24.083 --> 31:25.375
were playing Ron and Brian?

31:25.458 --> 31:26.708
Go to Mexico.

31:26.791 --> 31:28.291
Go to Mexico? No.

31:28.375 --> 31:29.875
I'm not telling her that.

31:29.958 --> 31:32.500
She seems, uh, very happy now

31:29.958 --> 31:32.500
and-and Buster is almost free.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.875
I'm sorry, Dad.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.666
I shouldn't have told you

31:33.958 --> 31:35.666
the truth.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.333
No, no.

31:38.416 --> 31:42.208
But I do think that we should

31:38.416 --> 31:42.208
make a one-time exception

31:42.291 --> 31:45.625
to the rule "Always be straight

31:42.291 --> 31:45.625
with everyone," hmm?

31:45.708 --> 31:49.625
I mean, honesty is always

31:45.708 --> 31:49.625
the best policy, but, uh...

31:49.708 --> 31:51.750
It's just not the only one.

31:51.833 --> 31:54.916
It's one of a bunch.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.500
<i>But unfortunately for Michael,</i>

31:56.583 --> 32:00.291

31:56.583 --> 32:00.291

32:00.375 --> 32:03.250
<i>wasn't that far away after all</i>

32:03.333 --> 32:04.750
<i>and had a plan of his own</i>

32:04.833 --> 32:08.333
<i>to make it seem like he, too,</i>

32:04.833 --> 32:08.333
<i>was part of the parade.</i>

32:08.416 --> 32:12.791
<i>A plan that we've decided</i>

32:08.416 --> 32:12.791
<i>to present in the style</i>

<i>-to which it harkens back.</i>

33:42.666 --> 33:46.583
I never even got the chance

33:42.666 --> 33:46.583
to tell him.

33:46.666 --> 33:48.875
It's over.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.291
I'm breaking up with you.

33:51.958 --> 33:53.541
Oh, and I need your keys.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.125
<i>Buster, unaware that he has</i>

33:55.208 --> 33:56.916
<i>only a few days left in jail,</i>

33:57.000 --> 33:58.833
- What's happening?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.833
<i>- Is also unaware</i>

33:58.916 --> 34:00.541
<i>he's part of a prison break...</i>

34:00.625 --> 34:02.208
- It's, uh, part of the act.

34:00.625 --> 34:02.208
- Oh.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.125
Anything for the kids.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.375
<i>...and risks 30 years</i>

34:04.208 --> 34:06.375
<i>for the crime.</i>

34:06.458 --> 34:09.375
<i> The parade really starts</i>

34:06.458 --> 34:09.375
<i>thinning out around here.</i>

34:09.458 --> 34:12.208
<i>Gob, abandoned and confused,</i>

34:12.291 --> 34:13.625
<i>can't get back in the closet.</i>

34:13.708 --> 34:15.833
It seems as if

34:13.708 --> 34:15.833
the Christian-y fellow

34:15.916 --> 34:17.500
is now a gay man,

34:15.916 --> 34:17.500
and by the looks of things,

34:17.583 --> 34:19.375
<i>-he'll be staying that way.</i>

34:17.583 --> 34:19.375
- Tony. Tony.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.208
<i>What a surprise.</i>

34:21.291 --> 34:22.958
- Yeah, not to me.

34:21.291 --> 34:22.958
<i> Tony!</i>

34:23.041 --> 34:26.250
<i>Sally, all but sure to win,</i>

34:26.333 --> 34:27.375
<i>visits Stan in the hospital.</i>

34:27.458 --> 34:29.416
It's called safety hair.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.166
Practically undetectable.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.833
They tell me

34:32.250 --> 34:33.833
John Travolta wears his

34:33.916 --> 34:35.291
even when it isn't hailing.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.958
No, no, no. Some clowns throws

34:35.375 --> 34:37.958
so much as a peach pit at you,

34:38.041 --> 34:40.041
it clanks and everybody knows.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.000
No, you want to keep me safe,

34:40.125 --> 34:42.000
let's build that wall.

34:42.083 --> 34:44.583
Those Bluths are dangerous,

34:42.083 --> 34:44.583
I'm telling you.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.458
Yeah, I guess they do have us

34:44.666 --> 34:46.458
by the short wigs.

34:46.541 --> 34:49.375
<i> And Tobias desperately</i>

34:46.541 --> 34:49.375
<i>tries not to lose</i>

34:49.458 --> 34:51.916
<i>-his most recent Lindsay.</i>

34:49.458 --> 34:51.916
- Help! Please! We need a doctor!

34:52.000 --> 34:53.708
It's an emergency.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.708
Hi. It's us again. Help!

34:53.791 --> 34:56.000
Did you redo the floors here?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.416
Help, we need a doctor.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.833
Oh!

34:58.916 --> 35:00.833
It's okay.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.833
She's usually on pain pills.

35:00.916 --> 35:02.416
Ugh. I'm gonna call it.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.250
Looks like she's been stiff

35:02.500 --> 35:04.250
for about 18 hours.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.750
Oh, no, no.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.750
She's very much alive.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.083
She just crashed through

35:05.833 --> 35:07.083
a papier-mâché wall.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.375
DeBRIE:

35:07.166 --> 35:09.375
I'm under the impression

35:09.458 --> 35:10.833
that if you're carried in

35:10.916 --> 35:12.541
they put you immediately

35:10.916 --> 35:12.541
on the morphine drip?

35:12.625 --> 35:14.625
- That's what we've been

35:12.625 --> 35:14.625
told before.
- Okay, look.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.166
- We prioritize according

35:14.708 --> 35:16.166
to need.
- Of course.

35:16.250 --> 35:19.250
- Here.

35:16.250 --> 35:19.250
- Oh, okay. All right.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.791
Help! Please! It's

35:19.333 --> 35:22.791
a higher priority emergency!

35:22.875 --> 35:24.291
Help!

35:24.375 --> 35:25.666
Oh, bullshit you didn't redo

35:24.375 --> 35:25.666
these floors.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.166
They look amazing.

35:29.791 --> 35:31.041
Help!

35:31.125 --> 35:33.250
I got to stop

35:31.125 --> 35:33.250
coming out this way.
