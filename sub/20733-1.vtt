00:10.428 --> 00:12.889
<i>How do you feel about losing
your studio in Hollywood?</i>

00:13.056 --> 00:15.600
<i>What the bank gives, the bank takes</i> away.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.479
<i>Do you think you'll ever make...</i>

00:20.730 --> 00:22.649
<i>Did you rebuild the sets three times?</i>

00:22.857 --> 00:26.110
<i>I don't know what I like until I see it,
then I know I don't like it.</i>

00:26.903 --> 00:30.156
<i>You think having a few hits
entitles you to waste that kind of money?</i>

00:30.365 --> 00:33.326
<i>My pictures have earned
over $100 million in rentals.</i>

00:33.493 --> 00:36.329
<i>That's how come I can get the backing
for the kind of things...</i>

00:36.496 --> 00:38.831
<i>This time, they didn't back you.
They pulled the plug.</i>

00:39.040 --> 00:41.376
<i>I always said
that if I had a choice of a way to die...</i>

00:41.543 --> 00:44.128
<i>I'd want to be screwed to death.
I think I just was.</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:46.673
<i>How much money did you lose
when they shut you down?</i>

00:46.881 --> 00:49.717
<i>What about your famous art collection?
Did you lose that, too?</i>

00:49.884 --> 00:52.345
<i>Come on, you'll have everybody
feeling sorry for me.</i>

00:52.554 --> 00:54.013
<i>Are you through with Hollywood?</i>

00:54.180 --> 00:55.974
<i>I think Hollywood's through with me.</i>

00:56.140 --> 00:58.685
<i>I guess you prefer New York anyway.
Things are more real.</i>

00:58.893 --> 01:01.229
<i>Anyplace real when you're making movies?</i>

01:01.396 --> 01:04.857
<i>- What directors influenced you the most?
- Abraham Zapruder.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:07.068
<i>- Who?
- Honest Abe.</i>

01:07.235 --> 01:08.653
<i>Can you spell that?</i>

01:09.445 --> 01:10.780
<i>J-F-K.</i>

01:16.578 --> 01:18.162
- Smile.
- Hey, honey.

01:20.623 --> 01:23.167
Man alive, ain't she something?

01:24.043 --> 01:25.211
Over here, honey.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.047
All right, baby. Right here, honey.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.389
This is great being in the White House.

Hey, honey, say "cheese" for papa.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.464
Look this way, honey.

02:11.466 --> 02:13.259
Let me see a little more flesh.

02:15.637 --> 02:17.347
Out of the way.

02:18.264 --> 02:21.309
Look this way, honey, say "cheese."

02:22.018 --> 02:23.686
Your turn, baby.

02:26.397 --> 02:29.025
Yo, you can't walk around, all right?

02:30.485 --> 02:32.320
You wanna rent a camera or what?

02:32.528 --> 02:34.447
It's cheap, $5.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.575
This way, right here.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.744
Give us a smile. Hey, honey.

03:06.688 --> 03:09.023
Mary Jean, where'd you go to so quick?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.985
I'm looking for Mary Jean.
You seen Mary Jean?

03:13.194 --> 03:14.737
There's no Mary Jean here.

03:14.987 --> 03:15.988
Lady, don't lie to me.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.991
I saw them taking pictures of her
in a round room upstairs.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.993
I don't know any Mary Jean.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.454
Lady, bullshit. I don't wanna hurt you.

03:23.705 --> 03:26.040
You threaten me, I'll call the cops.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.715
I'm looking for Mary Jean.

03:33.965 --> 03:35.299
My name's Mary Jean.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.094
- No. I just saw her upstairs.
- You saw me.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.220
You ain't her.

03:40.388 --> 03:44.475
My name is Mary Jean,
or I can be anyone you want me to be.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.519
Describe her.

03:46.853 --> 03:50.940
She's got blonde hair. She's very pretty.
And she's got green eyes.

03:51.566 --> 03:55.570
Well, I'm blonde and pretty,
and my eyes are green.

03:56.446 --> 03:59.073
No. You ain't Mary Jean. You ain't my wife.

03:59.574 --> 04:00.867
Are you sure?

04:30.104 --> 04:31.606
Why did you have to find me?

04:32.190 --> 04:33.900
Well, I did. Get on in.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.072
- My head.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.250
Make a left.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.628
- Where is it?
- It's over there.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.443
Come on, Keefe. Don't be a bastard.

06:00.695 --> 06:03.531
Put that down. Why don't we just go to bed?

06:04.282 --> 06:05.658
It's been so long.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.952
Don't you miss how I do it?

06:08.369 --> 06:09.996
Pull the damn shades.

06:50.912 --> 06:52.788
All he ever asks about is you.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.042
He wouldn't even remember me.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.712
I told him all about his mama.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.214
Not me. About somebody you made up.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.843
I told him I was bringing you back.
Just like I told him when I left.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.392
Watch. You watch it.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.064
I wouldn't be any good for him.
I don't know anything about being a mother.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.400
You're supposed to be an actress.
Why don't you learn the damn part?

07:22.944 --> 07:23.944
No.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.281
Anytime, but not now.

07:28.199 --> 07:29.825
Tell him I'm dead.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.413
Shit!

07:35.456 --> 07:37.249
Why did you have to come now?

07:38.084 --> 07:39.961
Any other time but now.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.672
Now that everything's opened up for me
for the first time.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.257
Oh, hell, if you'd been
any kind of success at all...

07:45.424 --> 07:47.259
but hell, no, as usual.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.596
That's right. As usual.
But this time you're wrong.

07:52.974 --> 07:55.184
Put that down.

07:55.351 --> 07:58.229
My messages.
Do you mind if I get my messages?

08:07.238 --> 08:09.615
This is Andrea Wilcox.
Any messages, please?

08:09.824 --> 08:13.285
<i>No, there aren't any calls for you,
and your payments are two months behind.</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:16.205
<i>We're going to have
to discontinue service. Hello?</i>

08:16.372 --> 08:17.915
THE FILMS OF CHRIS NEVILLE

08:18.708 --> 08:21.210
How many times did Mr. Neville call?

08:21.502 --> 08:22.962
Three times?

08:25.006 --> 08:29.093
Do tell him I won't be able to meet him
out by CafÃ© Central as usual tonight...

08:29.301 --> 08:33.097
but I'll be able to catch him
probably about midnight, by the Red Parrot.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.597
Thank you.

08:38.269 --> 08:41.188
That was Chris Neville, the director,
you heard?

08:41.397 --> 08:43.899
Yeah, I heard. Dinner and what else?

08:44.817 --> 08:46.235
I wouldn't lie.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.154
You'd see right through that, wouldn't you?

08:48.320 --> 08:52.283
Yeah, I can see this old guy has given
your career a big old push, hasn't he?

08:53.075 --> 08:56.203
Well, no sense blowing a relationship
by coming on too strong.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.248
Why, just last night,
you know what he said to me?

08:59.415 --> 09:02.126
"How would you like to be
in my new movie?"

09:02.293 --> 09:05.755
Yeah, what he does in them
$20 million porno flicks of his...

09:05.921 --> 09:07.673
it ain't acting.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.468
So you think explicit sex ain't acting?

09:10.634 --> 09:14.889
Why don't you just go ask 10 or 15 million
American wives about that one.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.808
Because some things
ought to be left to the imagination.

09:18.059 --> 09:20.061
What about retarded imaginations
like yours?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.063
I ain't gonna argue with you. You just pack!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.523
I remember you from school.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.818
You were the one who was going around
erasing all the dirty words...

09:27.985 --> 09:29.862
off the walls of the johns.

09:30.071 --> 09:33.240
You were always real good
about rubbing things out.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.660
You just go ahead
and pick out what you need.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.705
Get a move on and pack.

09:39.914 --> 09:42.875
You should see his place
in Greenwich Village.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.586
It's a whole block long.

09:55.262 --> 09:59.225
- He has terrific parties there, you know?
- Come on, get in here and get a move on.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.395
Sometimes they're even on TV,
his private parties.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.690
- All the big celebrities...
- I read about it in People magazine.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.567
And I could care less.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.903
I'll just go
and get my makeup together, all right?

10:11.112 --> 10:12.696
Then I'll be going.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.163
Bullshit.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.838
Bullshit, nothing but bullshit.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.387
I don't give a damn about him.

10:36.554 --> 10:40.349
I don't give a damn about Chris Neville,
and I don't want to hear about him.

10:41.809 --> 10:45.062
Grab a toothbrush
while you're in there, Mary Jean.

10:57.158 --> 10:58.450
Shit!

11:01.954 --> 11:05.833
Mary Jean, don't take any pills again,
'cause it ain't gonna work this time.

11:08.961 --> 11:09.961
Shit.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.435
Mary Jean, don't do this!

11:47.666 --> 11:49.543
NEVILLE FIRED FROM 30 MILLION FIASCO

11:49.710 --> 11:50.836
Newspaper.

11:57.635 --> 12:01.555
That's it. Get them while they're down.
They always get back up again.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.765
Hi. Hello.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.227
Hi, my name is Mary Jean.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.562
I was here to a party once.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.732
Of course, I didn't get in, but I was here.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.070
Hello? I'm freezing out here.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.242
Well, thank you.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.829
Thanks a lot.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.780
Who is that?

15:14.706 --> 15:15.833
Hi.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.045
What are you doing with that thing?

15:23.257 --> 15:25.175
What does this do to you?

15:32.057 --> 15:34.726
Jesus, that's real.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.395
What makes it real?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.647
Because I know it happened.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.442
Would you know
if you hadn't seen it on the news?

15:41.608 --> 15:42.943
His face.

15:44.445 --> 15:46.363
Nobody could fake that.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.159
What makes it different? Come on.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.203
Something.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.249
I don't know.

15:58.792 --> 16:02.838
What if there's no difference?
Real death, make-believe death.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.305
- So how's the party coming?
- What party?

16:12.264 --> 16:14.433
You mean all that buffet stuff and all.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.644
I figured somebody would show up
for the wake.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.438
You're the only one?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.274
Well, I'm just a student.
NYU, Cinema Department.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.610
I'm here to do a paper on you.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.448
On directors that get
canned off their own pictures?

16:29.781 --> 16:31.992
I know you must feel real sorry about that.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.955
I'm just hungry.
Why don't you make me something to eat?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.291
Didn't we go through this before?

16:39.458 --> 16:40.918
Don't you know?

16:41.502 --> 16:45.255
Ever remember an experience,
then realize you only saw it in the movies?

16:45.422 --> 16:46.757
Yeah, sure.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.058
I guess you don't believe
I'm really a film student now, do you?

16:56.225 --> 16:58.644
I bet you think
I'm one of those young actresses...

16:58.810 --> 17:01.355
who would say or do anything
just to get a part.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.398
Well, do I get the part?

17:03.565 --> 17:06.108
- Can you act?
- Of course not.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.654
Then you get the part.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.992
You know, just today,
I was telling someone...

17:14.159 --> 17:17.412
that I met you
and that I was gonna be in your movie.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.499
But I just made it up...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.126
and then I made it happen.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.420
That's how we make movies.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.507
We just make it up
and then we make it happen.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.555
I think we should do a slow dissolve
to the bedroom.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.099
At least I won't be an extra up there.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.527
I'll call you when it's time for your entrance.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.084
In key...

18:50.714 --> 18:51.840
soft.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.114
Get your gorgeous little bottom in here.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.033
Time for your entrance.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.260
You don't miss a trick, do you?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.430
You like that?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.980
We need all these lights?

19:49.648 --> 19:52.317
Things you do in the dark don't happen.

19:53.777 --> 19:57.823
Next thing you know, you'll want me
to make love with my eyes open.

19:59.825 --> 20:00.825
There.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.551
You got star material, babe.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.371
What's that noise?

20:47.289 --> 20:50.208
It's nothing, it's just the air conditioner.
Come on, come here.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.378
Sounds like a motor. Like a camera.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.132
Is that what you got in there?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.885
Sure, all these lights. I get your game.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.636
I told you I'd put you in the movies.

21:01.803 --> 21:06.016
- I do it all the time. We'll look at it later.
- Shit, you're just like all the others.

21:06.767 --> 21:07.976
Come on.

21:09.603 --> 21:11.980
No, I don't go that route.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.776
I am a married woman.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.654
Listen, I've read all about you.

21:20.155 --> 21:23.450
They say this is the only kind of movie
they're gonna let you make.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.577
Where'd you read this, in the Enquirer?

21:25.786 --> 21:28.121
They're not ever gonna let you go
near a soundstage...

21:28.288 --> 21:30.874
unless it's to shoot someone's ass.
That's what they say.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.502
What else? Come on, tell me some more.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.588
Given $25 million,
even a moron could have done a movie.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.633
But not you.
You're not so hot anymore, are you?

21:41.218 --> 21:42.636
You're losing it.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.681
You're losing it, aren't you?

21:47.474 --> 21:49.643
Why, you're really losing it.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.938
What happened to your special effect, babe?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.773
I'm gonna come out looking pretty...

21:54.940 --> 21:58.109
for your beautiful little camera in there,
aren't I?

21:58.318 --> 21:59.444
Aren't I?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.576
You like that?

22:07.577 --> 22:09.955
You're in the movies now. Enjoying it?

22:10.121 --> 22:12.207
Come on, look in the mirror.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.954
That's a take.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.292
ANDREA

22:55.458 --> 22:58.962
A Film by Christopher Neville

23:10.223 --> 23:11.683
I never met you.

23:14.728 --> 23:18.398
Just wash it all away, no one will ever know.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.721
If you're looking for Mary Jean,
she's gone off.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.514
- When do you expect her?
- I don't.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.932
Mind if I wait?

25:59.559 --> 26:01.186
I'm her husband.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.647
You better put your pants on
if you're gonna try to throw me out.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.399
You think I can't?

26:06.649 --> 26:10.403
Judging by how you tore this place up,
you're a pretty strong son of a bitch.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.031
How'd you get in here?
You seen Mary Jean?

26:13.198 --> 26:16.284
Yeah, a couple of hours ago,
out at Coney Island.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.036
You ever been out to Coney?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.954
She sent you for her clothes.

26:20.246 --> 26:23.166
You better get the hell on out of here
before y'all get hurt.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.835
- Trouble, Lieutenant?
- No, just getting acquainted.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.670
Cops.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.256
She put a complaint out on me?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.301
What do you know
about a red Plymouth station wagon?

26:33.468 --> 26:35.887
- I own one.
- Well, it's illegally parked.

26:36.513 --> 26:39.140
- How long you been in town, Keefe?
- Since yesterday.

26:39.933 --> 26:43.728
Must have made you mad as hell
to see her fooling around with these guys.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.480
I would've beat the crap out of her.

26:45.647 --> 26:49.734
- She deserved it.
- I never hit her, never in all our married life.

26:50.902 --> 26:53.696
Will somebody tell me
what's going on here?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.201
Nothing happened to her?

26:59.119 --> 27:01.579
I thought that might occur to you.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.753
She's not hurt bad?

27:09.045 --> 27:12.590
You're going to have to identify the body.
It's homicide.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.430
I got a little boy.

27:21.224 --> 27:22.851
He's 31 months old.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.523
Are you sure it's Mary Jean?

27:31.359 --> 27:32.610
Don't you know?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.738
- I was here all last night.
- Alone?

27:37.699 --> 27:39.951
She knew other guys.
You thought I was one.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.327
Who else did she know?

27:41.494 --> 27:43.663
- She never told me.
- Book him.

27:44.497 --> 27:47.125
You have the right to remain silent and to...

27:47.333 --> 27:48.773
Wait a minute. There's another name.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.504
There was some director.
She said she was sleeping with him.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.840
- She threw it out to me.
- Is that when you hit her?

27:54.007 --> 27:56.759
I told you I never hit her,
never in all our married life.

27:56.926 --> 27:58.303
What's this director's name?

27:58.469 --> 28:01.514
You must have known who he was.
Christopher Neville.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.808
From what I hear,
he's got his own problems.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.143
What?

28:05.852 --> 28:09.230
He made this bomb with
about $30 million worth of special effects...

28:09.397 --> 28:10.732
that went down the toilet.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.984
Just yesterday
he got bounced off another picture.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.528
And he can't get himself arrested.

28:17.488 --> 28:20.116
This Neville character, he called yesterday...

28:20.283 --> 28:22.660
and he left a message on her service...

28:22.869 --> 28:25.872
saying that he had to see her last night.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.876
Ain't you gonna do nothing about it?

28:30.043 --> 28:32.086
You just gonna stand there?

28:32.420 --> 28:35.798
Why don't you call up her service?
She left a number on the phone.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.014
Call her service. It's on the phone!

28:43.765 --> 28:45.767
Okay, check the messages.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.437
- Where's the phone?
- It's right there.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.857
Where's the number?

28:55.443 --> 28:58.279
We're arresting you.
Why don't you put on your pants?

29:04.244 --> 29:05.870
Christopher Neville?

29:10.792 --> 29:14.796
You know, if I was gonna murder anyone,
I'd wear better-looking underwear than that.

29:17.465 --> 29:20.718
Hello, this is Det. Vickers,
Homicide Division, NYPD.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.888
Were there any calls received
within the last 24 hours...

29:24.055 --> 29:25.723
for an Andrea Wilcox?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.016
<i>I'll check.</i>

29:27.183 --> 29:28.351
<i>No calls.</i>

29:28.685 --> 29:30.895
- No calls, no messages of any kind?
- No, Officer.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.062
All right, thank you.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.565
Wait a minute,
I heard her repeat the message.

29:34.732 --> 29:35.817
You're breaching, mister.

29:35.984 --> 29:39.112
I heard her when she talked on the phone.
She said something...

29:39.279 --> 29:41.531
- about the Red Parrot.
- Look, pal, do me a favor.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.408
Call your fucking lawyer.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.460
Here.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.258
I gotta go take a leak.

30:01.551 --> 30:04.012
If I had a story like yours,
I'd be too scared to pee.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.178
We gotta let him...

30:05.305 --> 30:07.432
or the Supreme Court
will reverse the conviction.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.058
Check it out.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.186
Yes, you have a constitutional right to pee.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.791
Leave it open.

30:34.417 --> 30:37.045
I can't piss with you guys watching me.

30:46.846 --> 30:50.975
She might have been a good-looker,
but she was a terrible housekeeper.

30:51.142 --> 30:53.311
She don't look too good there.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.818
Boy, these country boys
sure can hold water.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.238
Jesus, now I gotta pee.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.874
- Where to?
- Sightseeing.

31:58.543 --> 32:00.711
- Want a tour?
- Can't you just drive?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.171
Looking for a hooker?

32:02.338 --> 32:05.800
Shit, you don't have to pay for it.
At least, not in this town.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.552
No girls.

32:08.052 --> 32:11.264
Want me to drop you at a gay bar?
Don't be shy.

32:12.432 --> 32:15.184
I'm looking to find out
where Chris Neville lives.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.020
- Chris Neville? The moviemaker?
- Yeah.

32:18.271 --> 32:20.148
Look on the unemployment line.

32:20.982 --> 32:24.026
- He's a personal friend of the family.
- Really?

32:24.318 --> 32:26.696
Let me see if I can help you. Sam.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.113
<i>What do you want?</i>

32:28.281 --> 32:30.450
See if any of the drivers
picked up the Neville guy.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.243
<i>Who the hell's the Neville guy?</i>

32:32.452 --> 32:34.412
The whacked-out filmmaker Neville.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.747
He's in Soho, it's not far.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.125
<i>- He's on 12th street, near the river.
- Where's that?</i>

32:39.292 --> 32:41.127
What street?

32:52.430 --> 32:54.932
Sure you wouldn't want to see
some female impersonators?

32:55.141 --> 32:58.519
They got this small fan show
all the way over west by the river.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.272
You can't tell them from the genuine article.

33:36.599 --> 33:37.599
Hello?

33:38.309 --> 33:41.687
<i>Hello, Mr. Neville, can you hear me?</i>

33:42.188 --> 33:43.314
Who is it?

33:43.773 --> 33:46.150
My name's Keefe Waterman.
I gotta talk to you.

33:47.693 --> 33:48.986
Do I know you?

33:49.946 --> 33:51.989
<i>No, but you know my wife, Mary Jean.</i>

33:52.573 --> 33:53.991
Andrea Wilcox.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.250
I can't hear you.

34:05.419 --> 34:06.629
You're mistaken.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.757
She told me all about it.
You can't hide anything now.

34:10.925 --> 34:13.344
You better come down here
and talk this out with me.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.013
Mr. Neville?

34:29.277 --> 34:31.445
Mr. Neville, come on, what's it gonna be?

34:49.297 --> 34:51.632
You came a long way to take a leak.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.511
Son of a bitch.

34:58.389 --> 35:00.057
Don't move, buddy.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.768
Come on.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.565
Feet back, spread out.

35:16.407 --> 35:19.702
You have the right to remain silent,
you have the right to an attorney.

35:19.869 --> 35:23.914
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

35:43.267 --> 35:46.103
Look at my nails.
I never could've scratched her like that.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.481
Bitten to the quick. Nervous?

35:49.065 --> 35:50.775
You should be nervous.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.862
Anyhow, lab says
the scratches weren't made by fingernails.

35:55.613 --> 35:58.532
Three witnesses saw you
slapping her around on Broadway and 46th.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.660
She hit her head
as she was getting in the car.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.330
Look, you came to take her home.
When she refused, you assaulted her.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.415
When she tried to get away, you killed her.

36:06.582 --> 36:10.795
Then you drove the body all the way out
to Coney Island and you took the train back.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.338
I left her in my own car?

36:12.505 --> 36:14.965
Now why would I do
something dumb like that?

36:15.341 --> 36:16.509
Come on.

36:20.471 --> 36:21.972
Here's a special message.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.558
Wiesenthal.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.728
Waterman, how did you
get to Thomas Wiesenthal?

36:27.895 --> 36:29.146
Who is he?

36:29.355 --> 36:32.316
Apparently, he's been retained
to represent you.

36:32.483 --> 36:33.483
Who is he?

36:33.609 --> 36:36.654
Just about the top criminal lawyer
in Manhattan.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.781
You must have a guardian angel.

36:38.948 --> 36:41.867
So, it appears your civil rights
have been violated.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.995
We may have to bring assault charges
against the NYPD.

36:45.204 --> 36:48.791
In the meantime, we'll get you out on bail.
Make yourself comfortable here.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.669
We won't need you gentlemen
for a few minutes.

36:59.385 --> 37:02.513
So you really think you're gonna be able
to get me out?

37:02.722 --> 37:05.307
You were clearly coerced
into making damaging statements...

37:05.474 --> 37:07.435
without the benefit of counsel.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.062
You never said any of those things.

37:10.229 --> 37:14.191
As for the car, that was registered
in both your names back in Oklahoma.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.194
Let them prove you put her in it if they can.

37:18.738 --> 37:21.949
Aren't you the fellow that was
on the committee with Senator McCarthy?

37:22.116 --> 37:23.993
You're thinking of Roy Conn.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.871
He's a nice guy compared to me. I'm mean.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.583
Why are you being so nice to me?

37:30.791 --> 37:33.127
I want a movie made about my life someday.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.212
Come in, Chris.

37:38.799 --> 37:40.593
This is Chris Neville.

37:45.139 --> 37:48.559
So you put up the bail
and you bought the lawyer here?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.729
You did know Mary Jean.

37:57.526 --> 38:01.280
Keefe, when you're in the movies,
strange girls kind of flip out.

38:01.614 --> 38:04.492
Meet one at a party, and you laid her.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.745
Buy her a drink,
and you're the father of her child.

38:09.205 --> 38:12.666
Honestly, I don't recall Mary Jean at all.

38:13.501 --> 38:16.003
So you mean that she made up
the message and everything.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.005
Don't put her down for it, Keefe.

38:18.506 --> 38:20.299
She's just one of the pack.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.636
Fresh out of high school, full of dreams...

38:24.845 --> 38:26.430
dreams turn into lies...

38:26.806 --> 38:28.599
lies turn into angles.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.519
First thing these girls want
when they roll into town...

38:31.685 --> 38:35.314
is to have somebody buy them dinner
at Sardi's or Elaine's.

38:36.315 --> 38:39.610
Instead they meet a guy with a needle
over at Port Authority.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.447
It's just a couple of blocks from Sardi's.

38:43.614 --> 38:46.700
If you will excuse me,
I have to catch a shuttle to Washington.

38:46.867 --> 38:50.538
Don't worry about a thing,
my staff will take good care of you.

38:57.545 --> 39:00.005
So why are you telling me all this?

39:00.256 --> 39:02.633
Why do you want to help me?

39:02.842 --> 39:06.178
When you got busted in front of my house,
I got curious.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.680
About you...

39:07.972 --> 39:10.474
mainly about Andrea...

39:12.768 --> 39:15.145
how she changed here in the city.

39:16.814 --> 39:18.858
Yeah, she sure as hell did.

39:22.611 --> 39:25.239
Used to be
she was a good American mother.

39:25.948 --> 39:28.742
Her hang-up was being young, pretty...

39:29.785 --> 39:31.829
not gifted, right?

39:33.998 --> 39:36.166
I want to tell her story, Keefe.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.128
How this town chews beautiful girls up.

39:39.879 --> 39:42.089
What do you want, my permission?

39:42.256 --> 39:44.592
- Your participation.
- Come again?

39:45.092 --> 39:46.552
You're gonna be in it.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.345
You want me to act?

39:48.637 --> 39:50.931
No, not act. Be yourself.

39:51.599 --> 39:53.267
I can't do that.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.645
I always prefer to direct non-pros.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.815
But don't you understand?
It wouldn't be decent.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.362
Maybe we could prevent this
from happening to some other poor kid.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.409
I couldn't do it. I just couldn't.

40:12.119 --> 40:13.787
You can if you trust me.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.625
After all, it's my bail bond.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.086
Keefe, listen, I need this picture.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.548
A lot of people out there think I'm finished.

40:24.757 --> 40:26.967
I'm doing this the way I did
when I first started...

40:27.134 --> 40:30.804
16-mm on a low budget
and I guarantee completion myself.

40:30.971 --> 40:33.474
I don't even know
what the hell you're talking about.

40:33.641 --> 40:37.394
This is my last chance in this industry
to prove I can still cut it.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.356
After everything collapsed
out in Hollywood...

40:41.607 --> 40:43.901
I had kind of a breakdown, okay?

40:44.109 --> 40:46.695
Then I lost this picture because I went over.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.864
I guess I wasn't reliable anymore.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.575
So now I'm not bankable.

40:52.242 --> 40:55.579
I put up my fucking townhouse
to finish this picture.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.541
So don't turn me down, for both our sake.

41:00.751 --> 41:04.046
You wouldn't make me do something
that wasn't so, would you?

41:04.296 --> 41:06.423
The idea is to make it real.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.884
As totally real as I can get it.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.761
Where are we going now?

41:13.639 --> 41:15.724
I found you a place to stay.

41:22.356 --> 41:23.816
Her apartment?

41:24.233 --> 41:28.278
I took over the lease. You wouldn't believe
the morbid creeps who tried to rent it.

41:28.862 --> 41:31.949
The National Enquirer and the Star were
in there taking pictures...

41:32.116 --> 41:34.076
before I threw them out.

41:34.410 --> 41:37.079
She used to read both those newspapers.

41:37.246 --> 41:39.957
- What about all her things?
- Where she left them.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.336
Now how the hell
am I gonna be able to sleep there?

41:44.503 --> 41:46.880
I don't believe she was strangled
in that apartment.

41:47.047 --> 41:49.091
She wasn't. I know she wasn't.

41:49.258 --> 41:51.385
Well, then, no ghosts.

41:52.011 --> 41:53.721
Here are the keys.

41:57.599 --> 41:58.934
What about the murder?

41:59.518 --> 42:01.103
That gonna be in there, too?

42:01.520 --> 42:04.648
You won't play that scene
unless you belong in it.

42:52.488 --> 42:53.572
<i>Salvation Army.</i>

43:00.037 --> 43:01.872
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

43:04.625 --> 43:07.002
Here it is. Just like you ordered.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.505
400 feet of reversal.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.423
No protection print.

43:12.382 --> 43:14.384
Ain't that a little risky?

43:14.676 --> 43:17.971
- You run it through the lab yourself.
- Like I always do.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.724
- You didn't run any sine-x's.
- No tests.

43:20.933 --> 43:24.728
Processed it on my 12,
just like you specified...

43:25.312 --> 43:28.899
but if this don't come out,
don't go chewing my ass.

43:30.150 --> 43:32.194
Who'd you catch this time?

43:32.903 --> 43:34.238
Not allowed to tell.

43:35.072 --> 43:37.491
Listen, these big celebrities...

43:37.866 --> 43:40.536
they do it different than anybody else?

43:42.913 --> 43:44.540
Jesus, you know...

43:44.832 --> 43:48.001
if they knew you had hidden cameras
in that bedroom...

43:48.418 --> 43:51.713
this footage could be worth your life.

43:53.215 --> 43:55.425
Now, how would they find out?

43:57.261 --> 44:01.849
If you ever get the itch to show this
to anybody, I'd love to see this.

44:02.057 --> 44:05.227
Grushkin, someday you see it
on cable TV, huh?

44:05.644 --> 44:06.854
Bill me.

44:07.646 --> 44:08.772
Okay, John.

44:09.189 --> 44:11.650
- Good night, Mr. Neville.
- Good night.

44:16.989 --> 44:18.282
Take me up, John.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.617
A woman's work is never done.

44:46.685 --> 44:50.105
You ought to tell your assistant
not to let just anybody in the door...

44:50.272 --> 44:51.982
who flashes a badge.

44:52.566 --> 44:55.652
You can buy one of these
anywhere in town for $5 or $6.

44:57.070 --> 44:58.739
Not a very convincing prop.

44:58.906 --> 45:00.407
Delroy. Homicide.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.160
Excellent casting.

45:04.203 --> 45:06.830
You're busy, don't let me interrupt you.

45:08.498 --> 45:11.168
- You're putting fingerprints on everything.
- Bad habit.

45:11.335 --> 45:12.920
I'm crazy for touching things.

45:13.420 --> 45:16.506
Just last week,
I just had to pick up this murder weapon.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.509
Almost cut my finger open.

45:19.718 --> 45:21.553
Used to be I'd be talking to a guy...

45:21.720 --> 45:24.681
I'd find myself touching the lapel
of his suit...

45:24.848 --> 45:28.936
the weave, the wear of the cloth.
Didn't even know I was doing it.

45:31.897 --> 45:35.984
Have to keep out of museums:
Can't keep my hands off the paintings.

45:36.401 --> 45:37.736
Cracking UP?

45:38.195 --> 45:41.573
Different people have different ways
of showing tension.

45:43.242 --> 45:46.870
I know. I spent a couple of months
in Cedars-Sinai once, resting up.

45:47.079 --> 45:49.873
Doctors taught me a lot
about dealing with tension.

45:50.082 --> 45:52.709
So, is Waterman photogenic?

45:55.087 --> 45:57.339
I don't know, I haven't seen the tests yet.

45:57.506 --> 45:59.549
What's this picture supposed to be about?

45:59.758 --> 46:01.551
Murder, what else?

46:02.302 --> 46:04.221
Murderer plays himself.

46:05.305 --> 46:08.100
Not your usual subject. No special effects?

46:08.892 --> 46:12.354
People assume special effects
means taking models, miniatures...

46:12.521 --> 46:14.898
tricking them up, making them look real.

46:15.107 --> 46:17.901
I'm taking reality
and making it look like make-believe.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.861
That's a special effect, too.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.491
Okay. You got my $5.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.665
I could use more than your $5.

46:32.791 --> 46:36.545
I could use access to the autopsy reports,
description of the wounds...

46:36.712 --> 46:38.130
how they were inflicted.

46:38.297 --> 46:41.091
Why don't you ask your star? He was there.

46:43.093 --> 46:46.221
Play along,
I'll see you get a nice screen credit:

46:46.388 --> 46:50.309
"Without whose cooperation
this picture would not be possible."

46:51.226 --> 46:54.187
Change that to a conviction and you're on.

46:54.938 --> 46:57.774
I'll arrange to screen
the rushes for you daily.

46:58.025 --> 46:59.276
Movies, just for you.

47:01.528 --> 47:03.488
This is a scene-by-scene outline.

47:04.281 --> 47:06.575
I'd appreciate your suggestions.

47:10.078 --> 47:13.373
Any input you have.
Anything you see, right or wrong.

47:14.583 --> 47:17.544
You could act sort of as a technical advisor.

47:18.337 --> 47:20.339
- Technical advisor?
- Sure.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.890
There are some sequences missing.

47:30.182 --> 47:32.976
Those we improvise with your advice.

47:37.439 --> 47:38.482
Okay.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.611
When do we start rolling?

47:43.195 --> 47:44.654
As soon as we cast our victim.

47:44.863 --> 47:46.198
Someone so like Andrea...

47:46.365 --> 47:49.659
that old Keefe will have to live
the entire experience all over again.

47:51.078 --> 47:52.078
Great.

47:53.372 --> 47:54.831
Let me ask you something.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.125
I know it's none of my business...

47:58.043 --> 48:00.670
but what's with you and all these flowers?

48:00.837 --> 48:02.881
Why are you so crazy about flowers?

48:04.216 --> 48:05.342
I don't know.

48:05.509 --> 48:08.512
They're just so beautiful.
They die so quickly.

48:11.223 --> 48:13.141
You know, you're right about that.

48:46.758 --> 48:50.387
You better cast another actress
or call this whole thing off.

48:50.554 --> 48:53.765
It's Christmastime.
I wanna go home and see my boy.

49:03.108 --> 49:05.569
Oh, my God, have you seen this one?

49:10.866 --> 49:12.409
Who submitted her?

49:12.826 --> 49:16.079
Mercury Artists.
They sent everybody in their files.

49:19.833 --> 49:21.084
Have you seen her?

49:22.586 --> 49:23.879
I'm sorry.

49:27.757 --> 49:31.595
She's dead, and her own agent
don't even know or care.

49:32.262 --> 49:33.680
She was using another name.

49:34.306 --> 49:36.933
She was probably hiding from her dues.

49:37.225 --> 49:39.603
Look, call them up
and offer her $1,500 a week.

49:39.769 --> 49:42.022
That ought to shake them up a little.

49:43.607 --> 49:45.567
This had nothing to do with her.

49:45.734 --> 49:48.153
I lived with her and I took care of her.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.448
And I took her to the hospital
when we had our little son, Jimmy.

49:51.615 --> 49:54.159
This wasn't her.
This had nothing to do with her.

49:54.326 --> 49:56.453
She had nothing to do with any of this!

49:56.620 --> 49:57.662
Nothing!

49:59.664 --> 50:01.791
You could never make me do anything.

50:02.042 --> 50:05.086
All you could ever do
is try and make me feel guilty.

50:05.712 --> 50:07.047
The kid...

50:07.214 --> 50:10.091
I had to get married on account of the kid.

50:11.176 --> 50:13.595
I know I can do this part
better than anybody.

50:13.762 --> 50:15.472
You see, I knew Mary Jean personally.

50:16.097 --> 50:19.226
For years and years,
we were best friends. We were roommates.

50:19.392 --> 50:21.853
We shared everything. Cars, clothes, boys.

50:22.437 --> 50:24.648
I mean, I know her better than anybody.

50:25.190 --> 50:27.984
That's fine, next. That's good, thank you.

50:28.652 --> 50:30.070
Okay, let's move it along.

50:30.278 --> 50:32.072
I'm not going with you.

50:32.239 --> 50:33.490
You can't make me.

50:33.782 --> 50:35.367
You can sit down. Next.

50:35.534 --> 50:37.327
You could never make me do anything.

50:37.494 --> 50:40.455
The kid.
I had to get married on account of the kid.

50:40.664 --> 50:44.000
All you could ever do
is try and make me feel guilty.

50:44.834 --> 50:47.504
Can you please tell me
what this motivational thing is?

50:47.712 --> 50:49.589
Motivation is getting a job.

50:49.756 --> 50:53.176
You can't make me.
You could never make me do anything.

50:53.385 --> 50:55.845
All you could ever do is make me feel guilty.

50:56.054 --> 50:58.890
Look, we got five other murder cases
on our workload.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.643
I just came from all the way up in Harlem.

51:01.810 --> 51:04.145
Can't you see I'm doing a casting session?

51:04.771 --> 51:07.857
Later this afternoon
we got a script conference.

51:08.775 --> 51:11.820
And this evening
we're gonna go scout locations.

51:12.654 --> 51:16.366
Locations? What are you, a police officer
or are you in show business?

51:16.575 --> 51:19.786
And all you could do
is just try and make me feel guilty.

51:20.787 --> 51:23.707
That's why I had to get married,
because of the kid.

51:23.915 --> 51:25.083
She's wrong.

51:27.586 --> 51:29.379
Shit, I ought to squeeze that finger.

51:29.588 --> 51:30.964
I'm not going with you.

51:31.298 --> 51:32.382
You can't make me.

51:32.591 --> 51:33.633
I don't believe this.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.677
You could never make me do anything.

51:35.844 --> 51:38.388
All you could ever do
is try and make me feel guilty.

51:39.097 --> 51:42.684
The kid...
I had to get married on account of the kid.

51:43.101 --> 51:44.101
Rotten.

51:45.103 --> 51:47.147
I know, what can I say?

51:47.480 --> 51:50.734
The kid.
I had to get married on account of the kid.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.987
Great. Terrific. That's fine.

51:56.615 --> 51:59.951
You're all wrong for this part,
so maybe you're all right for the part.

52:00.493 --> 52:01.995
What we're going to do is...

52:02.245 --> 52:03.413
say it all together.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.749
I'm not going with you.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.792
You can't make me.

52:08.251 --> 52:10.920
You could never make me do anything.

52:11.630 --> 52:14.924
All you could ever do
is try and make me feel guilty.

52:16.009 --> 52:19.846
The kid.
I had to get married on account of the kid.

52:20.639 --> 52:23.141
Great, terrific. You're all fantastic.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.313
Everybody up. Thank you.

52:32.859 --> 52:34.569
Now, we're looking for non-pros.

52:34.736 --> 52:37.405
Keep your eyes open for anybody
that reminds you of Andrea.

52:37.572 --> 52:39.407
- That girl over there.
- That one over there.

52:39.574 --> 52:41.868
- Yeah, that chick and that chick?
- That could be her.

52:42.035 --> 52:43.286
Check her out.

52:46.039 --> 52:48.249
Write your name down and your number.

52:49.167 --> 52:51.628
Look at all these beautiful girls
around here, man.

52:51.795 --> 52:55.298
Go on. Take it easy, loosen up.
Try and have a little fun.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.134
She's good.

53:05.058 --> 53:07.560
You set that all up. You set it all up.

53:10.271 --> 53:11.815
Is that a threat?

53:12.899 --> 53:14.234
I don't know what it is.

53:14.401 --> 53:17.028
I hear the second murder
is always the easiest.

53:17.362 --> 53:20.281
You can tell your friends
that I'm going back to jail tonight.

53:20.448 --> 53:23.868
Do you understand me? I'm going
back tonight, you can tell them now.

53:28.623 --> 53:31.501
You don't get psyched out when I kiss you.

53:32.252 --> 53:33.503
Come on.

53:33.878 --> 53:37.340
Everybody blows once in a while.
Calm down.

53:38.299 --> 53:42.011
Look, I was over at the apartment today.
Her rags are missing.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.723
I gave them away to the Salvation Army.

53:45.306 --> 53:46.683
I need them.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.269
You never told me.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.354
Get them back.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.859
How am I gonna get them back now?

54:28.099 --> 54:29.934
- Hi.
- How you doing?

54:30.268 --> 54:34.063
I donated some stuff the other day.
I'm trying to get it back.

54:35.857 --> 54:39.402
This hasn't been sorted out yet.
You have to take it over there, upstairs.

54:39.569 --> 54:41.070
- That way?
- Right over that way.

54:41.279 --> 54:42.906
All right, thank you.

54:44.407 --> 54:46.743
He ain't gonna get anything back.

54:51.623 --> 54:53.082
Can I help you?

54:53.500 --> 54:55.835
I am trying to get some stuff back.

54:56.002 --> 54:58.588
I got the receipt for my contribution.

55:00.006 --> 55:01.883
- Receipt?
- Yeah.

55:03.927 --> 55:05.470
You want it back?

55:05.637 --> 55:07.722
Hey, this guy's got a receipt.

55:09.516 --> 55:11.601
You want to see something? Come here.

55:11.810 --> 55:13.144
You don't know where you are.

55:13.311 --> 55:15.563
Look at that. Want to go climb?

55:17.357 --> 55:20.109
What do you want?
Come on, go home with it.

55:21.486 --> 55:23.112
What's your name?

55:23.947 --> 55:25.907
Elaine, Elaine Bernstein.

55:26.074 --> 55:29.452
You aren't one of those guys
out to make trouble or something, are you?

55:29.619 --> 55:30.829
No, I hope not.

55:30.995 --> 55:34.123
Good, because you're never gonna
get your stuff back. Look at this.

55:34.290 --> 55:36.251
They belong to my wife. She died.

55:36.417 --> 55:39.629
Then what do you need...
Shut up, Elaine, it's none of your business.

55:39.796 --> 55:41.840
- You work here every day?
- Tuesdays and Thursdays.

55:42.006 --> 55:44.759
I volunteer my time and my talent,
or didn't you notice?

55:44.926 --> 55:47.053
Mondays, I read to the blind
at the lighthouse.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.639
Wednesdays, I'm up in Harlem
teaching kids the new math.

55:49.848 --> 55:51.933
Weekends, I'm busy with my feminist things.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.602
So I just don't have time
to be a shopper's aid.

55:54.769 --> 55:57.939
Why don't you just forget about the clothes
and take a tax deduction?

55:58.106 --> 55:59.106
I can't.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.484
Say, you're awfully young to be a widower.

56:01.693 --> 56:04.779
You need a nice vacation.
Ever been to Amsterdam?

56:05.989 --> 56:08.449
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah, Amsterdam.

56:09.033 --> 56:12.537
I never been there,
but I hear it's a pretty nice place.

56:13.037 --> 56:15.832
I'll tell you what,
I'm organizing a charter tour there.

56:16.040 --> 56:19.335
Fifteen people, 21 days, you get
a Volkswagen and unlimited mileage.

56:19.502 --> 56:21.296
Why the hell do you do all of that stuff?

56:21.462 --> 56:23.006
It keeps me busy.

56:23.965 --> 56:25.592
Where do you live?

56:26.718 --> 56:28.344
Central Park West.

56:30.930 --> 56:33.474
Hey, you got $850,000?

56:33.892 --> 56:34.934
No.

56:35.852 --> 56:38.021
My father's got the condo up for sale.

56:38.187 --> 56:40.815
You know, I think there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

56:40.982 --> 56:42.358
Trying to fix me up with a friend?

56:42.525 --> 56:45.236
Can't you just shut up and nod your head?

56:46.362 --> 56:47.362
Good.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.991
GERARD BOLLE

56:51.159 --> 56:53.119
Mr. Neville, you got a minute?

56:53.286 --> 56:54.412
Speak, freak.

56:54.579 --> 56:57.582
You know this new movie you're making,
this murder mystery thing?

56:57.749 --> 57:01.753
Everybody's talking about it.
You ought to clean up on it, you know?

57:01.920 --> 57:04.213
Here I go, being mercenary again.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.425
I guess that's what holds me back.

57:07.592 --> 57:09.844
I'm always talking about money.

57:10.595 --> 57:13.681
I guess I don't know how to talk to an artist.

57:17.185 --> 57:19.395
You ran that original footage?

57:20.271 --> 57:21.689
Just to test.

57:22.273 --> 57:25.485
Once I saw that rose on the pillow...

57:26.235 --> 57:28.071
I had to see the rest.

57:28.446 --> 57:31.199
It was supposed to be a surprise ending.

57:31.449 --> 57:34.285
Ending? I thought that was the beginning.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.664
Yeah, the surprise beginning.

57:39.290 --> 57:42.418
I wouldn't want to ruin it for you,
Mr. Neville.

57:43.962 --> 57:46.422
You're one of those sensitive types.

57:46.589 --> 57:50.426
It's wonderful
that you notice things in people. Potential.

57:50.885 --> 57:55.098
Tell me something, Grushkin.
Did you find that last scene too violent?

57:55.264 --> 57:56.599
Not for me.

58:06.985 --> 58:09.237
Hey, Chris, can I have a few shots?

58:11.489 --> 58:14.242
Chris, I think I found her. Take a look.

58:17.745 --> 58:20.873
I guess that's about as close
as you'll ever get.

58:32.176 --> 58:33.219
No.

58:34.012 --> 58:35.722
The eyes are wrong.

58:35.888 --> 58:37.807
Make them larger, dumber.

58:38.099 --> 58:40.560
Dumber? What are you talking about?

58:43.688 --> 58:46.482
Look, suppose I don't want
to be in your movie?

58:46.649 --> 58:48.735
What else have you got to do?

58:50.028 --> 58:53.489
I didn't come here for a job.
I came here to do a favor.

58:54.532 --> 58:55.992
That's not me.

58:57.243 --> 58:58.745
That's not me.

58:59.037 --> 59:01.664
Yeah? What's you, this nose?

59:03.291 --> 59:04.625
It's mine.

59:06.044 --> 59:08.755
Dr. Silverman, Madison and 74th?

59:11.424 --> 59:14.927
Dr. Weinberg, 88th and Park.
I don't like you.

59:16.471 --> 59:19.515
It gets worse.
Lam a maniac when I do a picture.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.393
- He admits it.
- Finally.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.025
So you're gonna tell me what to do?

59:29.233 --> 59:32.278
Yeah. First of all,
keep your shoulders straight.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.740
Stop using your hands when you talk.
Worst posture since Quasimodo.

59:35.907 --> 59:39.368
How are your tits?
We're gonna have to see them in this.

59:39.869 --> 59:42.205
It's so idiotic talking about it.

59:43.247 --> 59:45.416
What are my parents gonna say?

59:45.625 --> 59:49.962
They won't say anything about anything
'cause they won't have a little girl anymore.

59:50.129 --> 59:51.672
So who will I be?

59:51.839 --> 59:52.924
This?

59:53.174 --> 59:54.258
That?

59:54.926 --> 59:59.222
Look, tell them you went to Israel
to work on a kibbutz or something, okay?

59:59.430 --> 01:00:03.017
Don't talk to your parents or friends
as long as you're working on the movie.

01:00:03.184 --> 01:00:04.894
Get her someplace to stay, all right?

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.563
- What'll I bring?
- Bring your body.

01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:10.566
If you're using this picture for her hair,
this isn't right.

01:00:10.733 --> 01:00:12.860
Her hair color was much lighter than that.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.737
Forget about this picture.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.241
And these fingernails,
who's doing these fingernails?

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:19.826
Her fingernails weren't red.

01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:21.577
How did you know about her fingernails?

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:22.829
They were shorter, okay?

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.997
How did you know her hair color?

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:28.501
I saw the body at the autopsy, okay?

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.962
Just do something, okay?

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:35.091
Don't take it so seriously, okay?
It's only a movie.

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:38.553
10:00 tomorrow morning,
I want a transformation.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:39.929
Yes, sir.

01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:42.890
You got to be crazy to direct movies.

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:45.351
We got to be crazy to work on them.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:47.747
Phone

01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:53.002
Jimmy, I'm in New York right now
with your mama.

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:56.422
There's people walking all over the place...

01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:59.675
and presents in the window,
and horses pulling carriages.

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.219
Yeah, horses.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.764
Talk into the phone, honey.

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:08.643
Mama can't come to the phone right now.
She's asleep, honey.

01:02:10.019 --> 01:02:11.979
Not today, but real soon.

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:15.399
She's asleep. It's night time here.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.570
I'm gonna bring her home,
just like I promised you.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:21.530
I promise I'm gonna bring her home.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.151
It's been done.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:53.682
Now that's fresh.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.529
Some place, huh?

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.491
This is Mario at Mario's Real Italian Kitchen.

01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:13.035
We got clams, we got lobster,
we got spaghetti...

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.121
anchovies, lasagna, soup du jour.

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:18.499
We got the best cooks in town,
the best sauce, the best garlic bread.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:21.460
And don't forget Mario's
<i>mamma mia</i> all-you-can-eat salad bar...

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:25.297
with all the radishes, carrots, shrimps,
baco bits, lettuce, cottage cheese...

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:28.717
Swiss squares, celery sticks,
Swedish meatballs, cucumbers, croutons...

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:30.886
and ten different dressings you can eat.

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:32.638
You want to eat till you die.

01:05:32.805 --> 01:05:37.143
Come on down
to Mario's Real Italian Kitchen in Paramus.

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:39.478
We'll feed you like your mama used to.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:46.735
You don't talk to people.
You just do routines.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.405
I'm just trying to be charming.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.740
I heard you're into special effects.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:54.869
That's what the critics say.
They say, "He's all special effects."

01:05:55.035 --> 01:05:59.081
"Nothing but special effects.
No content, no substance whatsoever."

01:05:59.331 --> 01:06:01.083
You read that stuff.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:03.252
I got a new one for you.

01:06:03.878 --> 01:06:05.337
You want to see it?

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:06.589
Sure.

01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:08.674
You're ready for it?

01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.971
That's great. No strings attached.

01:06:15.264 --> 01:06:18.434
Who made your head? Carlo Rambaldi?

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:23.189
Hello, Chris.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.276
- Hi, Chad. How're you doing?
- Pretty good.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:32.740
I understand you're in preproduction
of a nice little movie.

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:37.453
I was hoping to talk to you
about negative pickup.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.873
We'll be ready to deliver it
for an Easter release.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.127
Gosh, Chris, thanks for thinking of us...

01:06:45.336 --> 01:06:47.087
but our plate's full.

01:06:47.338 --> 01:06:49.965
We're just not looking for any pictures
right now.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:54.011
You know, I was this guy's agent
for five wonderful years.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:58.265
I sold him
to every major studio in Hollywood...

01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:00.809
and now that I run my own studio...

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:03.729
there's just no one to sell him to me.

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:07.566
Enjoy your lunch, Chris.

01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:10.694
Bye, Chad.

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:12.863
How's your tennis game, Chris?

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.241
- Still beat your ass.
- That's good.

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:24.416
Now I do feel sorry for you.

01:07:25.626 --> 01:07:28.087
Sorry enough to sign your contract?

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:33.259
Wait till this picture's finished.
They'll all be bidding for it.

01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:40.266
Don't read it, just sign it.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:53.946
Thank you.

01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:57.241
Now you're in the movies.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.095
Okay, cut!

01:08:18.554 --> 01:08:21.055
How was that, everybody?
Was that great, or what?

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:24.393
That was really terrific, all right, that's great.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.979
I told you,
you weren't needed on the set today, buddy.

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:31.233
- When did you get here?
- I just now got here.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.109
Weren't we in a Crest commercial together?

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:35.069
- Was it Jell-O?
- No.

01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:37.823
- Chris says to record this.
- Don't worry, I'm getting this.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.200
You know, it's amazing
how they cast these things.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:42.870
First job outside of commercials
and I get to play myself.

01:08:43.037 --> 01:08:44.246
Oh, yeah?

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.957
You should have called some chicks.

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:49.001
If you ask me, she went both ways.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.836
I got to explain something to you.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:54.506
I thought you understood
that everybody's playing himself here.

01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:56.884
I mean, this is Andrea's husband.

01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:58.093
Him?

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:01.055
I've got nothing against you.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.724
- How long did you know her?
- A one-nighter.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.018
Then she never returned my calls.

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:07.435
And what did she say about me?

01:09:07.603 --> 01:09:10.689
Nothing. Honest, friend, nothing.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:12.858
Did she tell you we had a baby?

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.653
She was proud of not having stretch marks.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:18.656
- Come on, let's go.
- I want to watch, I want to see this.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.408
Stand off to the side.
Take it from the top, come on.

01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:23.993
Come on, let's get back to work here.
Let's start again.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:26.121
Will you get out of the scene, please?

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:27.956
I hardly remember screwing her.

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:29.957
Put a little more heat into it, all right?

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:33.587
On your marks.
Let's have a slate, please. Slate it.

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:36.090
Cue track, 33.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:38.466
Action. Come on, get into it now.

01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:42.095
Come on, put something into it.
I want some steam out of this thing.

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.478
You make dirty pictures.

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:52.606
Forget the kiss, go to the husband.

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:54.983
Take me back.

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:14.712
Better get security over here,
there's going to be trouble.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.880
You bastard!

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:26.181
How the fuck should I know
she was married?

01:10:31.437 --> 01:10:34.189
Cut, print. Beautiful.

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:38.485
Come on in.

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.781
Surprised you still want to talk to me.

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:46.952
It was the first time
I've ever been exposed to violent emotions.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:54.752
My parents were always quiet together,
like two old friends.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:58.881
The men I knew were irritable sometimes,
but never furious.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:04.052
I think if they were,
I would've laughed at them.

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:08.307
But not at you.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.435
You could have killed that guy.

01:11:11.894 --> 01:11:13.562
Maybe I wanted to.

01:11:25.491 --> 01:11:27.534
I know you're still hung up on your wife.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:30.829
But I'd like to think what you did
had something to do with me, too.

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.372
I mean me, as me.

01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:33.665
It did.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:39.922
I'm afraid of you.

01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:44.051
I've never let myself
be really frightened of anything.

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:47.846
I don't want you to be afraid.

01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:51.308
I don't even know if you've killed anyone.

01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:54.269
You had plenty of provocation.

01:11:55.187 --> 01:11:57.481
You got to believe that I didn't.

01:11:58.273 --> 01:12:00.108
No, don't tell me that.

01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:02.236
Just let me feel something.

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:03.946
Let me be alive.

01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:31.325
This is a big mistake.

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:35.787
Keefe wouldn't take her back
to a sleazebag motel room and then kill her.

01:13:35.954 --> 01:13:38.790
Is there any evidence
that he killed her back at the apartment?

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:40.000
Absolutely not.

01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:42.169
- Or in his car?
- No.

01:13:43.045 --> 01:13:45.923
You told me she had traces of soapy water
on her body.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.966
That she'd been bathed.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:52.721
Okay, I can buy the motel room angle...

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:57.059
but why the lavender sheets on the bed
and the red walls?

01:13:57.768 --> 01:13:59.311
Production values.

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:03.815
Look, I've been working on your dialogue...

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:06.693
revising some scenes...

01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:09.404
polishing it up a bit.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:14.785
This is a total rewrite.

01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:18.413
I know the typing is bad
but I added some great touches.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:25.212
Look, this is still my picture. I want you
to stay off the set while I'm working.

01:14:25.379 --> 01:14:29.925
You directors get so worried when
somebody tries to take your picture over.

01:14:30.634 --> 01:14:34.429
I still want you at the dailies,
but stay off the soundstage.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:37.724
You barring me from the set?

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:39.601
You son of a bitch.

01:14:41.979 --> 01:14:44.481
Mary Jean, don't you
run away from me again.

01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:45.774
Go away.

01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:47.901
You're my wife, Mary Jean.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.528
Not anymore.

01:14:49.695 --> 01:14:51.738
Honey, that cut on your head's
still bleeding.

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.281
I don't care.

01:14:54.825 --> 01:14:55.826
What the hell...

01:14:55.993 --> 01:14:57.619
Keep it going. We'll pick it up.

01:14:57.786 --> 01:15:01.581
You can't make me go away.
You could never make me do anything.

01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:03.083
Your line is...

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:06.461
All you could do
is make me feel guilty about that kid.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.463
Had to get married on account of the kid.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:12.300
'Cause going and getting rid of it
could've been a sin, right?

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:14.344
And when it was kicking hell out of me...

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:16.638
if I complained,
I'd feel guilty about that, too.

01:15:16.847 --> 01:15:19.099
I'm sick of having that kid
thrown in my face.

01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:21.059
- The kid, the kid.
- No.

01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:25.063
I had it, I nursed it, I got it out of diapers.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.482
- Now I'm through.
- No!

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:30.318
No, he ain't an "it." He's a human being!

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:32.696
And if you knew him you wouldn't say that!

01:15:32.863 --> 01:15:34.114
I hate him!

01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:36.283
No, you don't hate him!

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.118
Okay, cut, that's terrific.

01:15:38.285 --> 01:15:40.829
You son of a bitch! You made me hit her!

01:15:40.996 --> 01:15:43.832
This is really gonna be good. That's great.

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:48.336
Why did you talk to me like that?

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:52.007
It was as if I was somebody else,
I was so much into it.

01:15:52.174 --> 01:15:54.259
I ain't doing this shit anymore!

01:15:54.426 --> 01:15:56.178
Talk to the boy, okay?

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.895
Why did you want to go?

01:16:05.062 --> 01:16:07.230
Can't we just get out of here?

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.483
Why?

01:16:12.319 --> 01:16:16.698
Because for a minute there
you were just too much like her, that's all.

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:20.118
I know I was.

01:16:21.912 --> 01:16:25.874
It's sick. I mean, it's really sick,
and it's making me sick.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:30.754
We got to quit. We just got to
get the hell out of here, that's all.

01:16:31.088 --> 01:16:34.633
Quit halfway through?
I'm not gonna do that.

01:16:35.717 --> 01:16:40.138
For the first time, I have something to be
when I wake up in the morning.

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:42.265
I know who I am.

01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:44.976
And no one's gonna blow that for me.

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:47.771
You never cared about being
an actress before, never.

01:16:47.938 --> 01:16:49.106
Actress?

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:52.192
This isn't a career, just this part.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:54.694
What about when the picture's over?

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:57.322
When this is all over,
what are you gonna do after that?

01:16:57.489 --> 01:17:00.617
Can we get back to the story again?
Everybody back on the set now.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.369
Come on, shot 74.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.789
Sit down.

01:17:05.956 --> 01:17:08.917
Okay, wait, I got a great idea.

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:11.461
Nice romantic touch.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:14.047
Rose on the pillow, okay? Nice and...

01:17:14.214 --> 01:17:17.008
Now where would I get a notion
to do something like that?

01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:19.094
Would you stand back, please,
so we can work?

01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:21.054
It's symbolic, okay? Rose is on the pillow.

01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:24.266
Here, get rid of these.
These weren't even in the shot.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:26.351
You two make nice love now.

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:28.770
You make love with each other,
real creative stuff...

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:30.438
really make some heat in this thing.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:31.773
No.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.316
Get in the bed.

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:34.484
That's great.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.778
This is a closed set. Let's lock it up.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.365
Take those cowboy boots off.
You wouldn't have those on, come on.

01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:44.452
Take your clothes off. Socks too, come on.

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:46.913
Who makes love in their socks?

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.749
Only Gary Cooper or somebody like that.

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:58.466
I ain't doing nothing in front
of all these people. I ain't doing that.

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:01.970
Okay. Everybody's off for the rest of today.

01:18:02.137 --> 01:18:03.638
That's it. It's a wrap for today.

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:06.892
Bring me that camera over there, I'll shoot it.

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.566
Take off the bathrobe.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:17.068
Come on, everybody gone.

01:18:21.406 --> 01:18:23.700
Ditch the trunks, too, come on.

01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:36.213
Now you two, come on.

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:42.135
This is wrong.

01:18:42.302 --> 01:18:43.678
I don't care.

01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:47.015
I just know that I'm hooked, and so are you.

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.436
Okay, you can relax now.

01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:54.356
You're in privacy. Take her in your arms.

01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:00.862
Get on here.

01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:03.240
Keefe, take off the necklace.

01:19:04.115 --> 01:19:06.618
Take the necklace off. That's right.

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:14.292
Up and off, that's good. You're in the light.

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:17.921
Don't give the boy so much encouragement.
Treat him like Andrea treated him.

01:19:18.088 --> 01:19:19.714
UP, up, raise up...

01:19:20.924 --> 01:19:22.550
and touch her neck...

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:25.637
just lightly. That's beautiful, that's good.

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:28.306
Now kiss her...

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.017
kiss her passionately.

01:19:32.978 --> 01:19:37.107
Where's the rose? Pick up the rose.
Lift her up and put the rose underneath.

01:19:37.274 --> 01:19:38.566
That's it.

01:19:42.696 --> 01:19:45.949
Now look at the camera,
Elaine, look at the camera.

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:51.246
She's your wife.

01:19:51.413 --> 01:19:52.747
She lied...

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.125
she never died...

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.627
you never killed her.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.671
Shut up!

01:20:05.176 --> 01:20:07.012
<i>This is the age of the nonentity...</i>

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:11.016
<i>the glorification of the nobody,
as long as they're victims.</i>

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:16.104
<i>Look at the virtually nonexistent careers
of a Dorothy Stratten or a Frances Farmer.</i>

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:20.400
<i>What makes them worthy
of a $10 million eulogy on film?</i>

01:20:20.567 --> 01:20:23.320
<i>Murder, madness, suicide...</i>

01:20:23.737 --> 01:20:26.406
<i>that's what stars are made of today.</i>

01:21:24.839 --> 01:21:27.634
- Good night, Sardi.
- Good night, Mr. Neville.

01:21:37.477 --> 01:21:39.979
I must've passed you on the elevator.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:42.607
Figured you'd probably be upstairs,
cutting away.

01:21:42.774 --> 01:21:44.526
I'm exhausted. I got to get some rest.

01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:46.611
We're gonna talk first.

01:21:48.196 --> 01:21:49.239
What now?

01:21:49.406 --> 01:21:51.366
The home movies of my boy.

01:21:51.533 --> 01:21:52.784
Who says I've got them?

01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:56.287
The police. They told me
they just released them to you.

01:21:57.622 --> 01:21:59.040
Research, okay?

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:02.794
You're gonna use them
in the film, aren't you?

01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:04.087
Maybe.

01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:08.633
I'm mixing in actual footage.
It's part of the concept.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.552
I'll tell you something.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.971
You can do
whatever the hell you want to me...

01:22:13.138 --> 01:22:15.515
but you ain't messing with my kid.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:18.935
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:26.192
I want that reel of film.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.114
All I have to do is make one phone call,
and you're back in the joint.

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:33.116
So don't push it.

01:23:12.405 --> 01:23:15.450
Think I found the shot
you've been looking for.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:19.954
I told you the medium close-up.
Don't you hear me when I'm talking to you?

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:21.956
Doesn't anybody hear me around here?

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:35.470
Somebody left the piece of film I need
back at the other editing room.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.690
Where's Chris? I got a message from Chris
I was supposed to be here.

01:23:47.857 --> 01:23:49.234
I sent that.

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:52.654
That's about what I'd expect of you.

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:55.114
Wait, I want you to see something.

01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:57.825
I am really not interested.

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.331
This is our son, Mary Jean's and mine.

01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:06.334
You wanted to know all about her,
didn't you?

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:11.005
Sure hope this thing works.
It's been through hell.

01:24:26.688 --> 01:24:28.856
- Did you run it for her?
- Yes.

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:03.683
Take me to Andrea's apartment,
on the double.

01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:15.236
You got the loop hole wrong.

01:25:17.322 --> 01:25:19.240
Here, shut the gate.

01:25:24.162 --> 01:25:25.705
Get the lights.

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:55.943
What's happening?

01:25:56.152 --> 01:25:58.029
God damn it, you don't know
what you're doing!

01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.280
I don't know how to...

01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:00.698
Turn the damn thing off.

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:03.993
- I think it's getting stuck in the...
- It's ripping up all the film!

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.287
It's slicing it to pieces. Turn it off!

01:26:06.454 --> 01:26:09.916
Wait a minute! Damn, I don't know how.

01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:24.305
Pull out the goddamn plug!

01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:45.493
Don't take it so seriously, come on.

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.370
It's my baby, look at this.

01:26:47.537 --> 01:26:49.038
No, it's mine.

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:53.000
Original reversal. No prints.

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:55.712
- I thought...
- I know what you thought!

01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:02.510
Scratched or split, total wipeout.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.349
I guess that just means you're gonna have
to shoot the whole thing over again, right?

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:11.853
Nothing to it.

01:27:14.564 --> 01:27:18.109
I could duplicate the performance
as long as I have you.

01:27:30.288 --> 01:27:33.499
Go home. Go back to the hotel.
I'll call you later.

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:41.716
Take the reels off the machine.

01:27:42.133 --> 01:27:43.718
Hand them to me.

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:58.524
I had difficulty getting this sequence.

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.943
Waterman didn't want to go bare-ass.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:02.904
Had to clear the set.

01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:12.163
Run that back a little, will you?

01:28:16.459 --> 01:28:18.211
Back it up 100 feet.

01:28:30.223 --> 01:28:32.183
On the pillow, the rose.

01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:37.563
Kind of grabs you. Wish I'd thought of it.

01:28:38.064 --> 01:28:39.273
Who did?

01:28:40.066 --> 01:28:41.234
Keefe.

01:28:41.818 --> 01:28:44.821
I resisted at first, but he talked me into it.

01:28:46.155 --> 01:28:47.323
Thorns.

01:28:47.824 --> 01:28:49.617
Scratches on her back.

01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:53.204
I feel left out.

01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:54.872
Stay that way.

01:28:55.665 --> 01:28:58.417
Look, if it's too weird, the rose can go.

01:28:58.835 --> 01:29:01.963
It's my favorite shot.
We're picking Waterman up.

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.882
Guess that fouls your picture up?

01:29:05.883 --> 01:29:08.386
I only had one more scene to shoot...

01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:11.347
but it's only a retake. I can double them.

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:16.686
Look, after the arrest, could I steal
a couple of shots in the prison?

01:29:17.687 --> 01:29:19.021
Neville...

01:29:19.897 --> 01:29:22.817
I don't care what you do
as long as I get my screen credit.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.654
Associate producer, separate card,
and all paid advertising.

01:29:36.789 --> 01:29:38.040
<i>Don't talk, listen.</i>

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:40.626
<i>They're going to arrest you again,
this time for keeps.</i>

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:42.670
Don't fall apart.

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:45.798
Look, I want to help you. I owe you.

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:48.885
<i>Make yourself invisible,
then come to my house tonight.</i>

01:29:49.552 --> 01:29:52.930
I'll have people there until 11:00.
Come after 11:00.

01:29:53.848 --> 01:29:56.309
<i>- Got it?
- Yeah, okay. I'll be there.</i>

01:31:16.639 --> 01:31:19.141
You're late but you're beautiful. Come on in.

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:21.394
Well, I did come, after all.

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:32.780
It's awful about Keefe.

01:31:32.947 --> 01:31:34.907
Thought we weren't going to talk about him.

01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:38.119
What's the difference if I talk about him?
I'm thinking about him.

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:40.287
Or will that ruin your evening?

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:43.290
I mean, look at this,
everything's so carefully planned.

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:45.459
You don't do things, you stage them.

01:32:24.123 --> 01:32:27.710
Keefe couldn't have done
all those things they say he did.

01:32:27.877 --> 01:32:30.463
I used to think he was guilty, too,
but now I...

01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:35.009
He's schizo. If he found you here with me,
he'd probably cut your throat.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:38.763
Don't worry, he'd end up
cutting off his little pinkie...

01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:41.015
before he got around to that.

01:32:41.265 --> 01:32:43.851
- He's a klutz.
- Is he such a lousy lay?

01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:46.145
None of your business.

01:32:46.312 --> 01:32:48.856
I mean, you dug him.
Then, whammo! Total rejection.

01:32:49.065 --> 01:32:51.650
He wanted me to be like Mary Jean,
not Andrea.

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:54.945
Mary Jean, exactly like her. So I was.

01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:12.546
Come on, don't make me beg for it.

01:33:12.713 --> 01:33:16.258
Usually you get the girl to go to bed
before you give her the part.

01:33:16.425 --> 01:33:18.302
What do I have to gain?

01:33:19.178 --> 01:33:21.680
I'm used to working out of sequence.

01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:24.308
Anyhow, I didn't know you then.

01:33:26.769 --> 01:33:27.978
Who am I?

01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:30.898
I used to be a lot of different people.

01:33:31.065 --> 01:33:33.442
None of whom I particularly liked.

01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:36.403
Lately, I have been a bitch.

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:39.365
That's gone over really big with everybody...

01:33:39.532 --> 01:33:40.991
except me.

01:33:41.492 --> 01:33:44.245
So whom exactly are you inviting to bed?

01:33:45.037 --> 01:33:47.748
Why don't I mold a whole new personality?

01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:52.711
After all, you have the perfect raw materials.

01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:56.799
First guy who ever wanted
to get my pants off to mold my personality.

01:33:56.966 --> 01:33:59.301
Come on, don't shoot me down,
come inside.

01:33:59.468 --> 01:34:01.637
- I don't want to.
- Why?

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:04.890
I still don't like you.

01:34:05.057 --> 01:34:06.684
That's no excuse.

01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:41.505
Hey, don't rush it!

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:45.592
What's this, an original idea?

01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:48.345
I thought I saw this someplace before.

01:36:49.638 --> 01:36:51.473
It's a bit I thought you'd like.

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:54.435
It's a joke if I lay down on that. Ouch!

01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:01.817
Don't these things ever go off?

01:37:01.984 --> 01:37:03.736
Just close your eyes.

01:37:22.338 --> 01:37:25.674
<i>Look, I never could've scratched her.
Look at my nails.</i>

01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:29.219
<i>Lab says those scratches
weren't made by fingernails.</i>

01:38:39.665 --> 01:38:41.417
That's more like it.

01:38:42.876 --> 01:38:45.087
There's somebody in the house.

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:47.840
- Just stay.
- Hello?

01:38:48.006 --> 01:38:49.716
Stay on the bed.

01:38:50.259 --> 01:38:52.010
Get back on the bed!

01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:56.098
Don't move, I'll be back.

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.810
Who's there? Who the fuck is there?

01:39:18.454 --> 01:39:20.873
I can't find my way in here alone.

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:49.503
Get the fuses on the floor by the bar, quick!

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:08.689
He killed Mary Jean
and he's trying to kill us all!

01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:12.150
Turn on the lights,
get the lights turned on, quick!

01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:06.246
We discovered a hidden camera
behind the mirror in Neville's apartment...

01:42:06.455 --> 01:42:09.916
which he used to photograph
the murder of Andrea Wilcox.

01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:13.045
We also suspect that he was connected
with the strangulation...

01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:15.922
of Leon Grushkin, a film lab technician.

01:42:16.923 --> 01:42:19.593
I always had a feeling about this Neville.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.055
What about the movie Neville was making?
Will that ever be completed?

01:42:23.221 --> 01:42:24.473
Who knows?

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.934
Someone may come along
with the skill and insight...

01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:33.065
and knowledge of police procedures
to put all the pieces together.

01:42:34.191 --> 01:42:36.652
It would make one hell of a picture.

01:42:37.152 --> 01:42:38.152
Thank you.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.738
Thank you, Det. Phillip Delroy.

01:42:53.335 --> 01:42:56.588
<i>Pan American Airlines
flying to Dallas, Fort Worth...</i>

01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:59.841
<i>is in its final boarding process at Gate 12.</i>

01:43:00.717 --> 01:43:02.386
<i>Final call, please.</i>

01:43:09.518 --> 01:43:12.145
Waterman, Mr. and Mrs.

01:43:13.021 --> 01:43:14.564
Almost missed it.

01:43:16.858 --> 01:43:18.735
That would've been sad.

01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:22.239
I mean, our little boy
is going to meet us at the airport.

01:43:22.406 --> 01:43:24.741
Wonder if he'll recognize me.
It's been so long.

01:43:24.908 --> 01:43:28.328
Don't worry about it,
you look just like your pictures.

01:43:29.413 --> 01:43:30.997
Enjoy your flight.

01:43:31.164 --> 01:43:34.376
There will be a complimentary luncheon
and a movie.

01:43:37.754 --> 01:43:40.382
Come on, Mary Jean, we're gonna go home.

01:43:42.467 --> 01:43:45.303
Hurry up, folks,
you're gonna miss your flight.

01:43:46.427 --> 01:43:51.427
