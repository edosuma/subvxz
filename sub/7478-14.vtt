WEBVTT

00:09.300 --> 00:11.981
I'm Gage Jensen
and this is On the Line.

00:12.005 --> 00:15.190
Today we're with the ATF agents
as they prepare to infiltrate a group

00:15.214 --> 00:16.990
of suspected gunrunners.

00:17.014 --> 00:20.160
Going after criminals is one thing,
but going after those

00:20.184 --> 00:24.374
who deal in weapons practically
guarantees a violent confrontation.

00:24.398 --> 00:25.787
These agents have no idea

00:25.811 --> 00:28.415
just how much firepower
they're gonna have to go up against.

00:28.439 --> 00:30.627
Everything from machine guns
to grenades,

00:30.651 --> 00:33.289
to even rocket launchers
have been used against them.

00:33.313 --> 00:36.137
- Agents are storming inside.
- ATF! No one move!

00:36.161 --> 00:37.928
- Clear.
- I'm not hearing any shots,

00:37.952 --> 00:40.802
so they're going from room to room
looking for guns and perps.

00:40.826 --> 00:43.133
- All clear!
- All right, that's us. Let's go.

00:43.157 --> 00:45.387
Alpha team, clear. Building's secure.

00:45.411 --> 00:47.663
Copy that, Alpha team.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.600
We're gonna need a forensic unit.

00:49.624 --> 00:51.424
Copy.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.510
They're already dead.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.054
My God, they're already dead.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.142
Cut it.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.078
I said cut it.

01:02.102 --> 01:03.729
What the hell happened here?

01:39.558 --> 01:42.108
Oh, morning, Hetty.
Where is everybody?

01:42.132 --> 01:44.909
Upstairs waiting to be briefed
on a case.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.659
- Waiting for who?
- For you.

01:46.683 --> 01:48.980
- Oh, okay.
- But first,

01:49.485 --> 01:51.359
you owe me some paperwork.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.709
- Oh, I already dropped that report off.
- Mm-mm.

01:54.733 --> 01:58.584
Everyone received a list
of potential new recruits.

01:58.608 --> 02:03.448
And everyone has returned
his recommendation but you.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.418
We don't need a new recruit.
Dom is missing, not dead.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.062
I'm not trying to replace Agent Vail.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.353
I'm trying to give the team
the support it needs

02:14.377 --> 02:16.177
until his return.

02:16.679 --> 02:20.428
This isn't an office job, Hetty.
We don't need a temp.

02:21.142 --> 02:24.262
You're right, this isn't an office job.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.312
- I'll get to it when I have a chance.
- Uh-huh.

02:35.115 --> 02:36.146
Thank you.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.324
You're welcome.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.484
Have a good day.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.587
I will.

02:43.611 --> 02:45.534
Now, you want me to go upstairs
or not?

02:50.130 --> 02:53.557
I'm sorry I had bothered you
with this.

02:53.581 --> 02:55.087
You're not bothering me.

02:56.178 --> 02:57.720
My mistake.

02:58.430 --> 03:02.534
My experience has been
that your need to get in the last word

03:02.558 --> 03:05.217
is a sign of annoyance.

03:13.654 --> 03:16.880
- Ah, she found you.
- She always does.

03:16.904 --> 03:20.075
Yeah. Go ahead, Eric.

03:20.369 --> 03:23.132
The night before last,
the reality TV show On the Line

03:23.156 --> 03:26.177
was following ATF agents on a raid
of suspected gunrunners

03:26.201 --> 03:28.284
when they found this.

03:28.669 --> 03:32.477
Five dead, no obvious signs of death,
two in Marine uniforms.

03:32.501 --> 03:35.508
Uniforms are authentic.
The men are not.

03:36.344 --> 03:38.229
- They're not Marines?
- Not even close.

03:38.253 --> 03:40.386
Both guys are career criminals.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.634
I know that guy.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.695
Ian Albers. Small-time con.

03:46.719 --> 03:48.532
We bust him before?

03:48.556 --> 03:51.139
No. Not according to his record.

03:51.526 --> 03:53.957
Maybe one of those militia guys
we rounded up in the bush

03:53.981 --> 03:57.024
- a few months back?
- No, I remember the guys I bust.

03:57.949 --> 03:59.716
I've met him somewhere.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.376
If these guys aren't
real Marines, it isn't our problem.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.215
- L.A.P.D. Should handle.
- They are.

04:04.239 --> 04:05.800
But Director Vance wants to know

04:05.824 --> 04:08.014
why these two criminals
were impersonating Marines

04:08.038 --> 04:12.017
with some very authentic-looking
military IDs and what they were up to.

04:12.041 --> 04:14.182
He wants assurances
that the security of our bases

04:14.206 --> 04:16.173
has not been compromised.

04:23.391 --> 04:25.431
What is this place?

04:25.685 --> 04:28.947
Eric said it was registered
to a La Grange Enterprises.

04:28.971 --> 04:31.116
Turns out it was a bogus company.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.870
Well, it's a lab.

04:32.894 --> 04:34.230
But they weren't making meth.

04:35.028 --> 04:37.235
Not with what they have here.

04:38.115 --> 04:40.214
So, what were they cooking?

04:40.238 --> 04:43.410
I don't know.
Maybe something that killed them.

04:44.788 --> 04:47.006
Well, a drug overdose would show up
on an autopsy.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.761
So would a communicable disease.

04:48.785 --> 04:50.595
Fumes of some sort?

04:50.619 --> 04:53.712
Which brings me back
to my first question.

04:54.298 --> 04:57.583
What were they making?
Where is it?

05:01.722 --> 05:03.679
Someone cleaned this place out.

05:04.308 --> 05:06.360
Someone who didn't get killed.

05:06.384 --> 05:09.051
What was with the Marine uniforms?

05:10.689 --> 05:13.180
You know, feel free
to chime in here any time.

05:14.235 --> 05:17.022
Looks like those men
weren't the only ones who died here.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.469
Yeah.
KENSI It's Kensi.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.392
Eric and I have been sifting
through electronic records

05:29.416 --> 05:33.142
of the dead men. We found a vector
between a recurring phone number

05:33.166 --> 05:35.353
and GPS activity
of one of their vehicles.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.639
You have an address?

05:36.663 --> 05:41.395
Yeah. It's,
uh, 299 North Sierra Bonita.

05:41.419 --> 05:44.608
Mm... Owner's name is Balmore.

05:44.632 --> 05:47.357
All right. Have HAZMAT team
come here and sweep this place.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.016
HAZMAT?
Callen, what did you guys find?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.080
- I don't know.
- Well, if you and Sam

05:52.104 --> 05:54.621
have been exposed,
the medical officer has to look at you.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.074
Your health could be at risk.

05:56.098 --> 05:59.314
So could yours if you keep
eating the breakfast burritos.

06:01.324 --> 06:02.960
- How did you, um...?
- The cheese.

06:02.984 --> 06:04.867
Makes your voice phlegmy.
Not good.

06:05.286 --> 06:06.781
Goodbye.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.266
- That's 13 birds, two squirrels.
- What are the chances

06:16.290 --> 06:18.872
these guys were cooking up
some sort of biochemical weapon?

06:19.718 --> 06:23.383
Sure as hell hope not because if they
were, then we've been exposed to it.

06:36.667 --> 06:37.923
It's a nice neighbourhood.

06:37.947 --> 06:40.475
Hate to see small-time cons
hanging out around here.

06:40.499 --> 06:43.209
Yeah. Small-time cons
aren't running this operation.

06:43.549 --> 06:45.375
Whatever it is.

06:48.804 --> 06:51.212
Lawn could use a rake.

07:06.864 --> 07:09.355
What a mess.

07:13.746 --> 07:14.909
Mrs. Balmore?

07:16.916 --> 07:20.343
I'm just all butterfingers today.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.418
I just have to clean this up.

07:22.838 --> 07:27.880
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.
Special Agent G. Callen. NCIS.

07:28.261 --> 07:30.728
- Could we ask you a few questions?
- Well, of course, dear.

07:30.752 --> 07:32.899
But I need to clean this up.

07:32.923 --> 07:35.531
It was full of sugar water
for the hummingbirds.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.490
So if I don't hose it off right now,
it's gonna be.

07:38.514 --> 07:40.621
"Leiningen Versus the Ants"
back here.

07:40.645 --> 07:42.250
- Let me help you with that.
- Okay.

07:42.274 --> 07:44.209
- Thank you very much. Huh?
- Mrs. Balmore.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.600
Do you recognise these men?

07:45.904 --> 07:47.422
I know Corporal Ames.

07:47.446 --> 07:50.840
Oh, and that's Corporal Bishop.
They're my Marine Corps drivers.

07:50.864 --> 07:54.818
- Where did they drive you?
- The research facility.

07:56.122 --> 07:58.198
I wasn't supposed to say that.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.382
It's classified.

08:00.406 --> 08:02.803
National security.

08:02.827 --> 08:05.211
You can tell us. We're NCIS.

08:05.549 --> 08:07.185
Oh, you are.

08:07.209 --> 08:08.795
Yeah.

08:11.471 --> 08:13.772
- How's your research going?
- Very well.

08:13.796 --> 08:17.449
I thought I would be rusty
after all of these years,

08:17.473 --> 08:21.321
but I was able
to isolate several grammes

08:21.345 --> 08:24.144
of Clostridium botulinum last week.

08:25.152 --> 08:27.109
- Botulism?
- Mm-hm.

08:27.404 --> 08:29.669
Most dangerous toxin
known to man.

08:29.693 --> 08:34.028
Would either of you gentlemen
like some lemonade?

08:40.333 --> 08:43.145
I never wanted to be an Army wife,

08:43.169 --> 08:45.709
but I was in love with my husband.

08:47.549 --> 08:50.147
- There you go.
- Oh, you're so kind.

08:50.171 --> 08:51.399
Thank you, Steve.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.611
- Sam, ma'am.
- Ah.

08:53.635 --> 08:57.530
- You're welcome.
- Sam. I'm so sorry.

08:57.554 --> 09:00.454
Sometimes I think I'd forget my head
if it wasn't attached.

09:00.478 --> 09:03.018
It's fine. It's okay.

09:04.275 --> 09:08.462
So you enlisted and wound up
working in the Army's medical unit.

09:08.486 --> 09:12.948
Yes. Now, that was
an old boys' network back there.

09:13.451 --> 09:17.590
Well, it's so nice of Steve to bring tea.
Are you married?

09:17.614 --> 09:23.186
- No. Ha. No, um... Let's talk about...
- A handsome young man like yourself?

09:23.210 --> 09:25.097
I work a lot.

09:25.121 --> 09:27.181
- My husband, Roger...
- That was Kensi.

09:27.205 --> 09:29.979
Coroner has confirmed
it was botulinum poisoning.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.394
Vance, Homeland Security
and CDC have all been alerted,

09:32.418 --> 09:34.480
along with the local medical services.

09:34.504 --> 09:37.219
And HAZMAT's doing a sweep
of Esther's place.

09:37.642 --> 09:40.928
Who knows what else
granny was cooking up there.

09:41.813 --> 09:43.770
Should Nate be wearing a mask?

09:44.232 --> 09:47.292
No, he's safe. You don't catch botulism
from other people.

09:47.316 --> 09:49.834
But we might've been exposed
because we were in the lab.

09:49.858 --> 09:51.085
You feeling okay?

09:51.109 --> 09:53.986
Yeah. Nothing a couple weeks
of vacation can't cure.

09:54.576 --> 09:56.509
I hear that.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.221
You're very tall.

09:58.245 --> 10:00.263
My husband, Marty, was tall.

10:00.287 --> 10:03.469
He died of a heart attack
at Santa Anita several years ago.

10:03.493 --> 10:06.124
We loved the ponies.

10:07.422 --> 10:11.776
Let's talk about your work
at Fort Detrick in the late '60s.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.878
Bacterial purification.

10:14.304 --> 10:16.771
The work we did
revolutionised the production

10:16.795 --> 10:18.989
of antibiotics and other drugs.

10:19.013 --> 10:22.446
Wow. And what about
your most recent work?

10:22.470 --> 10:24.780
Oh, well, I'm long retired.

10:24.804 --> 10:27.224
And your research at the lab?

10:28.402 --> 10:29.944
Lab?

10:31.572 --> 10:35.320
Where your two drivers took you?

10:35.951 --> 10:38.597
Well, yes. I forgot about that.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.910
I helped them isolate proteins.

10:42.208 --> 10:48.922
A neurotoxic protein produced
by the bacterium C. Botulinum.

10:52.176 --> 10:54.939
Yes. Of course, that's it.

10:54.963 --> 10:57.011
- Thank you for reminding me.
- Mm.

10:58.099 --> 11:00.768
Why did they need
the botulinum toxin?

11:01.060 --> 11:02.696
Antidote research.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.849
So our boys in uniform will be safe.

11:06.357 --> 11:09.085
She seems like just a sweet
old lady.

11:09.109 --> 11:11.080
She is a sweet old lady.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.339
Someone tricked her
into creating biochemical weapons.

11:14.363 --> 11:17.237
- Would you excuse me a moment?
- Mm-hm.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.140
Well?

11:27.164 --> 11:30.764
I think she's delightful and, um,
extremely dangerous.

11:30.788 --> 11:32.352
She's suffering from Alzheimer's.

11:32.376 --> 11:35.362
She remembers the '60s and '70s,
vivid detail,

11:35.386 --> 11:37.855
but has memory lapses
about more recent events.

11:37.879 --> 11:41.152
All right. Well, it is one thing
to forget to feed your dog,

11:41.176 --> 11:43.367
it's another
when you forget security protocols

11:43.391 --> 11:45.245
and you're dealing with bioweapons.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.952
She may be responsible
for those men's deaths.

11:47.976 --> 11:51.910
Or the person behind this
used what she created

11:51.934 --> 11:53.487
to tie up the loose ends.

11:53.822 --> 11:57.273
And if that's the case,
she could be in danger.

11:59.036 --> 12:01.763
Botulinum is a neurotoxin protein.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.387
Very popular in Hollywood
where it is known as Botox.

12:04.411 --> 12:06.433
Kills the muscles that cause wrinkles

12:06.457 --> 12:08.928
for that "Don't I look 20
even though I'm 50" look.

12:08.952 --> 12:10.932
It can paralyse
your breathing muscles

12:10.956 --> 12:12.270
and you suffocate to death.

12:12.294 --> 12:16.049
In fact, it is the deadliest substance
known to man.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.735
So the housewives of Beverly Hills
should be classified

12:18.759 --> 12:20.045
as biochemical weapons.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.193
Do you guys know what LD50 is?

12:22.217 --> 12:23.697
It's the median lethal dose.

12:23.721 --> 12:26.705
The amount of toxin needed
to kill half of the people exposed.

12:26.729 --> 12:29.329
Lower the LD50,
the more dangerous the substance.

12:29.353 --> 12:33.664
Exactly. Now, the botulinum toxin
has the lowest LD50 there is.

12:33.688 --> 12:40.458
So a sample only this small
could kill up to a quarter million people.

12:40.482 --> 12:42.297
And if what Esther told us
is accurate,

12:42.321 --> 12:45.308
then she isolated enough
to kill 10 times that.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.219
She's like the evil Martha Stewart.

12:47.243 --> 12:50.893
Only she's not evil. She's vulnerable
because of her Alzheimer's.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.523
Whoever is behind this, knew that.

12:52.547 --> 12:53.854
They must've sought her out,

12:53.878 --> 12:57.027
tricked her into thinking her expertise
was needed for national security.

12:57.051 --> 13:00.481
Yeah, she's an easy mark.
But an unreliable witness.

13:00.505 --> 13:01.902
Poor thing.

13:01.926 --> 13:04.851
She must've enjoyed
the company and attention.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.449
The real question is who's behind this
and where the hell's the toxin?

13:08.473 --> 13:10.035
Oh, we may have a lead.

13:10.059 --> 13:11.668
Remember this guy?

13:11.692 --> 13:14.077
- Ian Albers?
- I've been trying to.

13:14.101 --> 13:19.166
Well, he used to be a bouncer
at Club Halo for our old pal, Dallas.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.742
I knew I recognised him.

13:21.119 --> 13:24.511
Maybe he's moved on from blackmail
to dealing in bioweapons.

13:24.535 --> 13:26.805
You think Dallas is behind this?

13:26.829 --> 13:28.850
If he is, he's gonna wish he wasn't.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.261
Dallas closed the Halo Club
after the Safar incident.

13:31.285 --> 13:34.108
He's been keeping a low profile since.
Apparently not low enough.

13:34.132 --> 13:36.268
The dude's proven
he has friends in high places.

13:36.292 --> 13:38.733
- And low places.
- He's gonna call his D.C. Buddies

13:38.757 --> 13:41.230
to shut us down like last time.
He's not gonna cooperate.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.522
At least not willingly.

13:42.546 --> 13:44.823
And get this,
supposedly he replaced his security

13:44.847 --> 13:47.616
with a bunch of retired
East German Secret Police.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.244
The latest Hollywood accessory.
Special ops security team.

13:50.268 --> 13:52.954
Hetty, any suggestions
on getting Dallas?

13:52.978 --> 13:56.378
Yes. I suggest we don't have
this conversation.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.208
Forget diamonds.

13:58.232 --> 14:03.614
In this business, plausible deniability
is a girl's best friend.

14:04.246 --> 14:07.887
Now, sit down and say, "Ah."

14:07.911 --> 14:10.753
Hetty, honestly, I'm fine.

14:11.420 --> 14:14.313
Asset protection is part
of my responsibility

14:14.337 --> 14:16.522
and you are an asset.

14:16.546 --> 14:19.777
When you're not being a pain
in the asset.

14:19.801 --> 14:21.678
Now, open wide.

14:22.431 --> 14:25.598
- "Ah."
- Ah... Agh.

14:27.686 --> 14:28.694
What was that for?

14:28.718 --> 14:31.908
It's a healthy gag reflex.

14:31.932 --> 14:35.832
It's the first thing to go
in botulinum poison.

14:35.856 --> 14:37.357
Stop laughing. You're next.

14:41.450 --> 14:44.380
Dallas hid his electronic footprint
pretty well. He was hard to find.

14:44.404 --> 14:45.634
For the record,

14:45.658 --> 14:48.131
I walked away 30 seconds ago.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.716
Always was careful.
Last time, we had to go to his club

14:50.740 --> 14:54.061
- just to look at his computer.
- But he didn't hide his credit cards.

14:54.085 --> 14:56.188
At least not well enough
to hide them from Eric.

14:56.212 --> 14:58.647
Apparently the crime syndicate
is recession proof.

14:58.671 --> 15:01.310
Five days a week,
Dallas has been getting massages

15:01.334 --> 15:04.240
at a place called
the Ahimsa Retreat.

15:04.264 --> 15:07.492
- What is that?
- A wonderful day spa.

15:07.516 --> 15:10.746
They have the best
foot rescue packages.

15:10.770 --> 15:13.644
It's like sending your toes to heaven.

15:14.734 --> 15:18.210
I'm not through
with either of your evaluations.

15:18.234 --> 15:20.872
Hetty, we're both fine.
We really need to move on this.

15:20.896 --> 15:24.823
Well, then you'll just have
to make it quick.

15:25.287 --> 15:27.754
- You look good in a robe.
- I look good in anything.

15:27.778 --> 15:30.032
- Ready?
- Yeah.

15:56.110 --> 15:57.959
- What the hell...?
- Relax.

15:57.983 --> 15:59.873
Don't be so tense.

15:59.897 --> 16:02.206
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

16:02.230 --> 16:04.008
Come on.
What are you, stupid, Dallas?

16:04.032 --> 16:07.653
You think this is a random robbery?
You're butt-naked.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.927
I have friends.
Lots and lots of friends.

16:10.951 --> 16:13.367
Right now, all you have is a gun
pointed at your head.

16:14.211 --> 16:15.374
What do you want?

16:15.796 --> 16:17.812
I want information
on biochemical weapons,

16:17.836 --> 16:19.857
specifically botulinum toxin.

16:19.881 --> 16:23.609
- Oh, come on. I'm not involved with...
- I didn't ask you if you were involved.

16:23.633 --> 16:25.323
I said I want information.

16:25.347 --> 16:27.234
Now, you've got two seconds
to come clean

16:27.258 --> 16:30.030
or I guarantee this massage
won't have a happy ending.

16:30.054 --> 16:32.161
I don't mess with that crap.

16:32.185 --> 16:34.370
But there's a guy.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.079
Call him the Dutchman.
Supposedly he's made some.

16:37.103 --> 16:40.835
Now he's selling.
That's all I know. I swear to God.

16:40.859 --> 16:43.165
God doesn't like
when you swear to him.

16:43.189 --> 16:45.667
And I don't like to be lied to.

16:45.691 --> 16:48.335
Now, if I have to come back here,
if I find out you played me,

16:48.359 --> 16:50.672
I'm gonna shiatsu your ass
into dog food.

16:50.696 --> 16:51.905
- You hear me?
- Mm-hm.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.791
Make sure you drink plenty of water.

16:58.673 --> 17:00.962
Stay facing down.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.181
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Dutchman,

17:16.204 --> 17:19.102
a.k.a. Jacobus Troyger,
a.k.a. Sebastian Boon,

17:19.126 --> 17:21.760
a.k.a. Jurgen Vanderveer,
a.k.a. Yada-yada-yada.

17:21.784 --> 17:23.516
Guy's got more aliases than Callen.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.042
Somehow I doubt that.

17:26.092 --> 17:27.646
European terrorist.

17:27.670 --> 17:29.504
Technically he's an arms dealer.

17:29.971 --> 17:32.272
He sells weapons
to radicals and insurgents.

17:32.296 --> 17:34.656
- Ipso facto, he's a terrorist.
- And in Los Angeles.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.318
Haven't been able to find record
of him entering the country.

17:37.342 --> 17:40.201
Well, he probably used an alias
that wasn't on our watch list

17:40.225 --> 17:41.750
and then entered through a port

17:41.774 --> 17:44.408
which doesn't have
a facial recognition system in place.

17:44.432 --> 17:46.164
If he's staying to sell his bioweapon,

17:46.188 --> 17:48.248
there's a good chance
people are coming to buy.

17:48.272 --> 17:51.295
I'll check with Homeland Security
and Border Control.

17:51.319 --> 17:52.714
I'll contact Interpol,

17:52.738 --> 17:55.639
see if they've picked up chatter
or tracked any movement overseas.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.550
Eric, check the flight manifest,

17:57.574 --> 18:00.205
port surveillance.
We might just get lucky.

18:00.585 --> 18:02.993
Mr. Callen, a moment.

18:04.506 --> 18:07.044
If she puts
on her rubber gloves, run.

18:07.968 --> 18:09.818
Hetty, I appreciate the concern,

18:09.842 --> 18:12.847
but I draw the line
at turning my head and coughing.

18:13.223 --> 18:16.924
I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.388
Now, first,

18:19.813 --> 18:23.739
how is our elderly bioweaponeer,
Esther Balmore?

18:23.763 --> 18:26.564
- Getting her medical evaluation.
- Oh, good.

18:28.030 --> 18:29.109
That was first.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.337
- What's second?
- Oh, uh, your partner.

18:32.361 --> 18:38.489
Sam has been reluctant to weigh in on
the selections for a temporary agent.

18:38.749 --> 18:41.560
Sam doesn't play well with others
and doesn't like to share his toys.

18:41.584 --> 18:45.975
But times like these only emphasise
the void left

18:45.999 --> 18:50.728
by the absence of Agent Vail,
however temporary.

18:50.752 --> 18:55.732
Sam is eternally hopeful
that Dom is going to return to his post.

18:55.756 --> 18:58.531
Sam sees the glass as half full.
I see it as half empty.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.008
That's why we make good team.

19:00.688 --> 19:02.573
Kensi just drinks right out the bottle,

19:02.597 --> 19:05.241
Nate wonders why it has to be glass,
and Eric breaks the glass

19:05.265 --> 19:09.203
- by putting his feet up on the table.
- Nevertheless, I want his input

19:09.227 --> 19:12.797
if only to begin to move him forward.

19:12.821 --> 19:15.863
Maybe you could give him
a little nudge.

19:16.871 --> 19:18.615
Big guy does not like to be nudged.

19:24.921 --> 19:26.095
I'll be gentle.

19:26.119 --> 19:27.922
Thank you.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.854
Tell me something good.

19:34.878 --> 19:38.401
Sam was right.
Interpol has various persons of interest

19:38.425 --> 19:40.903
who were stopped boarding planes
bound for L.A.

19:40.927 --> 19:42.658
In Berlin, London and Madrid.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.999
- We put LAX on full alert.
- And we got a hit.

19:46.023 --> 19:47.521
Simon Amputuan.

19:47.903 --> 19:50.275
He's a Filipino militant
with ties to Abu Sayyaf.

19:51.656 --> 19:55.132
Also known as Al Harakat Al Islamiyya.

19:55.156 --> 19:56.334
Or Islamic Movement.

19:56.358 --> 19:58.671
They've been waging a bloody
campaign of kidnappings,

19:58.695 --> 20:00.011
bombings and assassinations

20:00.035 --> 20:02.935
in their fight for an independent
Muslim state in the Philippines.

20:02.959 --> 20:05.225
Call ICE.
Hold Amputuan for questioning.

20:05.249 --> 20:07.852
And have Nate meet us
at the boathouse.

20:07.876 --> 20:10.349
I don't know any Dutchman.

20:10.373 --> 20:14.133
Okay. You realise you're on
the terrorist watch list, Mr. Amputuan?

20:14.430 --> 20:16.315
There are many Amputuans
in the Philippines.

20:16.339 --> 20:18.733
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

20:18.757 --> 20:22.409
I've heard there are well over
a million people on those watch lists.

20:22.433 --> 20:25.498
- It must be easy to make mistakes.
- Mm.

20:25.522 --> 20:28.703
What about your involvement
with the militant group Abu Sayyaf?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.915
Again. I'm afraid you have
the wrong information.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.964
I run a business call centre.

20:33.988 --> 20:37.170
Oh, great. He's not just a terrorist.
He's a telemarketer.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.970
That's almost worse.

20:38.994 --> 20:41.048
I don't appreciate
your racial profiling.

20:41.072 --> 20:44.391
This isn't about race, Mr. Amputuan.
It's about terrorism.

20:44.415 --> 20:46.969
Like your involvement
with the 2004 SuperFerry bombing

20:46.993 --> 20:49.021
killing 116 people.

20:49.045 --> 20:50.353
That was a tragedy.

20:50.377 --> 20:52.791
That had nothing whatsoever
to do with me.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.045
Clock's ticking, Nate.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.678
- Time to turn up the heat.
- Please.

20:59.016 --> 21:01.946
Okay. Here's the deal, Simon. Uh...

21:01.970 --> 21:03.864
The Dutchman was arrested
this morning

21:03.888 --> 21:05.866
and he started naming names.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.327
- Look, I told you. I don't know him.
- Really?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.962
Because if you didn't know the guy,

21:10.986 --> 21:14.071
then you would've at least been
curious to see who I was talking about.

21:15.492 --> 21:16.748
Sorry. Too late.

21:16.772 --> 21:19.549
So you're either gonna cooperate
and work with us

21:19.573 --> 21:21.513
or you're gonna get fingered
by Jacobus.

21:21.537 --> 21:23.663
Or whatever name
you know him by.

21:28.505 --> 21:32.229
I would feel better if I was provided
with legal counsel.

21:32.253 --> 21:35.853
From here on in,
just so as to ensure there are no, uh,

21:35.877 --> 21:37.524
misunderstandings.

21:37.548 --> 21:40.106
Fortunately for us,
you're an unlawful combatant.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.285
Unfortunately, the boys
at Guantanamo Bay have no vacancy.

21:43.309 --> 21:45.696
So much for that sunny
Caribbean getaway.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.154
We do know some Mossad agents

21:47.178 --> 21:49.907
that would gladly buy you
an all-expense-paid trip to Tel Aviv.

21:49.931 --> 21:51.688
Can you say "shalom"?

21:55.616 --> 21:57.158
Okay.

21:57.826 --> 22:00.922
There is a rumour
that the Dutchman is auctioning off

22:00.946 --> 22:03.612
- the botulinum toxin.
- Where?

22:05.709 --> 22:06.930
I don't know.

22:06.954 --> 22:09.773
You've come a long way
to not know where you're going.

22:09.797 --> 22:11.731
I didn't say
I was here for the auction.

22:11.755 --> 22:14.296
I said I heard rumours of it.

22:14.551 --> 22:18.477
I also heard of a rendezvous point.
I imagine it could be someplace

22:18.501 --> 22:20.899
where a would-be bidder
could be picked up

22:20.923 --> 22:24.303
- and taken to the proceedings.
- Did you ever meet the Dutchman?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.450
- No. I told you. He's...
- Yeah. You know what? We got it.

22:27.474 --> 22:29.416
We want an address,
we want code words

22:29.440 --> 22:31.624
and everything else
you've heard rumours about.

22:31.648 --> 22:33.871
What if the Dutchman's
seen pictures of Amputuan?

22:33.895 --> 22:35.506
He must've screened these guys.

22:35.530 --> 22:36.872
I'll go in as his muscle.

22:36.896 --> 22:39.838
I'm gonna review the files,
learn the history, his associates.

22:39.862 --> 22:41.755
- Know it cold.
- I don't like this.

22:41.779 --> 22:44.386
I don't either, but the auction's today.

22:44.410 --> 22:46.349
We don't have time to plan anything.

22:46.373 --> 22:49.009
Besides, I'm the only one
who's been vaccinated for botulism.

22:49.033 --> 22:51.145
SEALs are inoculated for everything.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.213
Except suicidal tendencies.

22:54.258 --> 22:56.856
And he knows I'm right
or else he'd argue to go instead of me.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.464
I don't want either of you to go.

22:58.805 --> 23:00.857
Nate, relax.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.717
Sam's the best man for this job.

23:03.393 --> 23:05.196
Besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

23:05.220 --> 23:08.515
Oh, I don't know. Let's see,
Sam gets made, they kill him.

23:08.857 --> 23:10.706
You, Kensi, and the others
storm the place

23:10.730 --> 23:12.371
and the Dutchman
releases the toxin,

23:12.395 --> 23:14.917
killing all of you
and half of Los Angeles.

23:14.941 --> 23:16.655
- Which half?
- Which half?

23:17.324 --> 23:19.233
I'm gonna go brief the director.

23:24.706 --> 23:26.366
You have had your shots, right?

23:26.791 --> 23:28.250
Yeah, I had a shot.

23:28.543 --> 23:29.682
Annual boosters?

23:29.706 --> 23:32.084
Hmm. I'm gonna go suit up.

23:39.930 --> 23:41.400
Vest is tight.

23:41.424 --> 23:42.950
It's rubbing.

23:42.974 --> 23:46.202
Well, better chafed than dead, I say.

23:46.226 --> 23:48.363
The camera is right here.

23:48.387 --> 23:51.541
They'll probably sweep you,
so the electronics we're providing you

23:51.565 --> 23:53.868
can be remotely activated
and deactivated

23:53.892 --> 23:57.165
so as not to be detected. All right?

23:57.189 --> 23:58.585
Eric, let's give it a try.

23:58.609 --> 24:00.739
Turning Sam on now.

24:04.288 --> 24:05.568
Scary.

24:08.626 --> 24:14.664
They'll take your phone and any gun
so I'm providing you with this.

24:15.925 --> 24:19.590
It's a ballistics briefcase.
It'll stop most bullets.

24:19.887 --> 24:25.094
Inside are $3 million
in marked bearer bonds.

24:25.810 --> 24:28.431
And twist, pull.

24:28.646 --> 24:32.229
And voilą. A ceramic blade.

24:32.692 --> 24:36.108
That's it? No, uh, you know,
parachute or shark repellent?

24:37.196 --> 24:39.319
I put that in your shoes.

24:39.699 --> 24:41.299
Botulinum protocols?

24:41.323 --> 24:43.426
Ingest it or inhale it, you die.

24:43.450 --> 24:45.921
Get it in an open wound, you die.

24:45.945 --> 24:47.343
Let's hope the vaccine works.

24:47.367 --> 24:48.891
I almost forgot.

24:48.915 --> 24:53.306
In here is an ampoule
of an experimental antidote.

24:53.330 --> 24:56.185
Click for the needle.

24:56.209 --> 24:58.849
If you're exposed, use it.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.353
Just for good measure.

25:01.377 --> 25:03.903
Callen and the rest of us
will run a box around you

25:03.927 --> 25:06.387
- the entire time.
- Keep it loose.

25:07.018 --> 25:08.453
No helicopters.

25:08.477 --> 25:10.163
These guys'll be paranoid.

25:10.187 --> 25:11.446
You're not ready?

25:11.470 --> 25:13.533
Take longer to get dressed
than Kensi.

25:13.557 --> 25:16.770
- I have been ready for five minutes.
- Let's do it.

25:17.988 --> 25:21.108
- Sam looks like he's getting impatient.
- He is.

25:22.117 --> 25:25.237
And in about 10 seconds,
he's gonna complain about it.

25:27.205 --> 25:28.368
They're late.

25:32.044 --> 25:34.096
You guys know each other
pretty well, huh?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.494
Well, we should.

25:36.340 --> 25:40.254
We've been together longer than
most married couples in this town.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.844
You worried about him?

25:46.308 --> 25:48.882
Right now I'm worried
about all of us.

25:50.312 --> 25:51.890
Yeah.

25:53.607 --> 25:56.312
Ah, what if Amputuan lied?

26:01.782 --> 26:04.510
- Hollywood Boulevard.
- I'm sorry, I'm not from around here.

26:04.534 --> 26:06.529
Oh, where are you from?

26:07.079 --> 26:08.953
Lots of places.

26:09.206 --> 26:10.511
What's your name?

26:10.535 --> 26:12.250
None of your business.

26:17.465 --> 26:19.422
He was grabbed at the airport.

26:20.134 --> 26:21.569
I beg your pardon.

26:21.593 --> 26:22.851
Amputuan.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.806
I got through. I'm authorized
to negotiate on his behalf.

26:27.892 --> 26:29.742
Sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:29.766 --> 26:33.056
I have $3 million in bearer bonds
that says your boss does.

26:35.566 --> 26:37.226
Excuse me.

26:42.907 --> 26:44.567
Think he bought it?

26:45.160 --> 26:46.986
We'll find out soon.

26:52.709 --> 26:54.203
Follow me, please.

27:30.654 --> 27:32.197
This way.

27:32.406 --> 27:33.948
Close the door.

28:03.438 --> 28:05.703
I'm so sorry for the hood, mister?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.393
Cook. Felix Cook.

28:08.026 --> 28:09.579
That's him. That's the seller.

28:09.603 --> 28:11.746
Jacobus Troyger. The Dutchman.

28:11.770 --> 28:15.208
Just one more little security protocol.

28:15.232 --> 28:17.092
Blondie patted me down good
back there.

28:17.116 --> 28:20.048
What do they say during those
American football broadcasts?

28:20.072 --> 28:24.007
Any recording of this game without
the NFL's consent is prohibited.

28:24.031 --> 28:26.451
Same courtesy applies here.

28:27.045 --> 28:28.243
Okay.

28:30.590 --> 28:32.464
Cut his equipment.

28:33.719 --> 28:35.877
Let's hope
we can get him back again.

28:38.432 --> 28:40.092
He's good.

28:42.269 --> 28:43.324
Thank you.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.098
Please.

28:49.485 --> 28:51.749
L.A.P.D., SWAT and HAZMAT
are en route.

28:51.773 --> 28:55.255
Rendezvous is at 7th and Santa Fe.
Nolan, you coordinate SWAT.

28:55.279 --> 28:58.212
I want them in position,
but out of sight until they see us go in.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.008
Morris, you've got HAZMAT.
They've gotta be right on our heels.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.841
I don't want anyone else dying
from this.

29:02.865 --> 29:05.009
Start at the rear perimeter,
move forward.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.703
All right, let's go.

29:09.255 --> 29:11.140
Eric? What's it looking like in there?

29:11.164 --> 29:14.211
- Well, without Sam's feed we're blind.
- Turn him back on.

29:18.431 --> 29:20.862
Ugh, Troyger must be
employing a jamming device.

29:20.886 --> 29:24.392
I can enhance this later,
but for the live op, this is it.

29:28.441 --> 29:30.065
He look familiar to you?

29:31.152 --> 29:33.559
You're gonna have to turn
a little more, Sam.

29:34.322 --> 29:35.353
That's it.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.046
My, my. Benno Dragovic.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.589
Supplies Serbian mercenaries
worldwide.

29:43.613 --> 29:45.390
There are a lot of people
in Washington

29:45.414 --> 29:48.501
who will wanna see
what we've stumbled upon here.

29:49.003 --> 29:51.921
We're not seeing any more cars, Sam.
You think the gang's all here?

29:55.969 --> 29:58.211
Looks like this party's starting.

29:58.555 --> 30:00.713
What kind of firepower
are we talking about, Sam?

30:05.311 --> 30:07.327
You ever seen the Dirty Dozen?

30:07.351 --> 30:09.123
A dozen?

30:09.147 --> 30:12.103
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

30:15.155 --> 30:16.898
Tracking.

30:18.325 --> 30:20.543
All teams moving into position.

30:20.567 --> 30:22.024
Welcome.

30:23.330 --> 30:27.280
In 1969, when the U.S. Army
stopped making biochemical weapons

30:27.584 --> 30:31.012
they were far more advanced
than they admitted publicly.

30:31.036 --> 30:34.605
I have recruited an Army scientist
that remembers the recipes.

30:34.629 --> 30:37.042
On offer today,

30:37.678 --> 30:40.844
a botulinum that is highly flexible.

30:42.266 --> 30:45.777
It can be vaporised against troops
on the battlefield.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.662
Or you can spread it on bullets.

30:47.686 --> 30:50.393
And even a flesh wound
becomes lethal.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.652
Abu Nasim, the old warhorse.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.585
He's not on Troyger's list
of known associates.

30:57.609 --> 30:59.465
Oh, sure he is.

30:59.489 --> 31:04.012
Abu Nasim isn't the name.
It's an honorific from the culture

31:04.036 --> 31:08.475
where older people are revered
with marks of respect.

31:08.499 --> 31:11.871
His name is Sadiki Hassan.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.308
He's on there,
Your Honour Lady Lange.

31:16.332 --> 31:21.301
This party favour
is a vaccine to the botulinum.

31:22.014 --> 31:25.134
Uncle Sam would never
let you have this.

31:25.685 --> 31:26.965
I hope we don't need it.

31:31.691 --> 31:33.066
Get in positions.

31:38.072 --> 31:39.483
Now,

31:39.741 --> 31:43.608
you should all know the value
of what you are buying.

31:44.370 --> 31:49.008
And as many of you will resell
in your various markets,

31:49.032 --> 31:52.304
I thought a demonstration
would add value.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.461
What kind of demonstration?

31:55.006 --> 31:56.963
The kind that makes
international news.

32:08.186 --> 32:09.384
The mall.

32:09.980 --> 32:14.227
Is there a more iconic place
of American consumerism?

32:15.318 --> 32:18.545
Within the hour,
an associate of mine will deploy

32:18.569 --> 32:21.027
just a few micrograms
of the botulinum,

32:21.533 --> 32:24.629
cut with the vaporising powder
that will carry it throughout the mall.

32:24.653 --> 32:26.406
What mall?

32:28.624 --> 32:30.451
I can't tell what we're looking at.

32:31.043 --> 32:32.288
Where is that?

32:32.711 --> 32:34.585
Here in Los Angeles.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.107
But don't worry, Mr. Cook.
You're safe here.

32:38.131 --> 32:41.634
Yeah? What if I wanna do
a little shopping before I go home?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.724
Isn't that
the Hollywood Town Centre?

32:48.644 --> 32:50.138
Or is it the Sunset Avenue Mall?

32:51.105 --> 32:55.434
Let's just concentrate
on the shopping in here first, shall we?

32:56.318 --> 32:58.168
Assault teams
back to covert positions.

32:58.192 --> 33:00.497
Eric, Kensi and I will take
the Hollywood Town Centre.

33:00.521 --> 33:01.919
Send agents over to Sunset.

33:01.943 --> 33:04.073
And HAZMAT teams in both places.
Already on it.

33:06.287 --> 33:09.098
I don't wanna spook Troyger.
Nobody move on the warehouse

33:09.122 --> 33:10.725
until we find this guy at the mall.

33:10.749 --> 33:12.636
Big guy, we've got some bad news.

33:12.660 --> 33:14.804
You're gonna have to stall
for a while.

33:14.828 --> 33:20.401
Now, as you all know,
the bidding will begin at $1 million.

33:20.425 --> 33:22.811
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.028
But I'm concerned
about your demonstration.

33:25.052 --> 33:28.058
We still have to get this stuff
out of the country.

33:28.351 --> 33:31.138
If a whole bunch of people get killed
in a biochemical attack,

33:31.604 --> 33:33.573
they're gonna lock
the whole city down.

33:33.597 --> 33:36.121
You would rather pay $7 million
for something

33:36.145 --> 33:38.476
that, as far as you know,
could be crushed aspirin?

33:39.487 --> 33:41.610
Does anyone else share
Mr. Cook's concerns?

33:47.454 --> 33:50.300
Apparently, you are the only one
who seems to be bothered by this,

33:50.324 --> 33:51.673
Mr. Cook.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.117
And why is that?

34:01.968 --> 34:04.376
I just wanna do this smart.

34:14.813 --> 34:17.791
Seriously. Are we here to buy weapons
or for you to perv on me?

34:17.815 --> 34:20.107
Because if these pants come off,
I want a discount.

34:20.570 --> 34:22.371
A big discount.
Know what I'm saying?

34:22.396 --> 34:24.706
All I know
is that you're a very stupid man.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.172
I'm stupid? Heh.

34:27.196 --> 34:29.918
At least I don't have these two
in the same room together.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.931
- Drago there killed Hassan's boy.
- Don't listen to him.

34:32.956 --> 34:35.117
Chechnya, 2002.

34:36.085 --> 34:39.121
Hassan's boy is over there,
you know, paying his jihadi dues.

34:39.589 --> 34:42.672
And old Drago was running black ops
for, uh, Putin.

34:42.967 --> 34:44.212
Code name Crusader.

35:17.085 --> 35:19.078
- Move, move, move.
- Go, go, go.

35:21.381 --> 35:23.919
Hold it! Stay where you are! L.A.P.D.!

35:24.218 --> 35:25.937
You still haven't done me
the courtesy.

35:25.961 --> 35:27.393
I'm a ghost.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.817
Come on.

35:28.841 --> 35:30.484
Hands behind your back
and shut up.

35:30.508 --> 35:32.474
Stay where you are!

35:39.441 --> 35:42.502
I'm not seeing anyone from the file
of known associates at either place.

35:42.526 --> 35:45.209
Nobody acting like they're about to kill
hundreds of people.

35:45.233 --> 35:46.662
Any luck there, Hetty?

35:46.686 --> 35:48.715
Working on it.

35:48.739 --> 35:50.048
I can't do this.

35:50.072 --> 35:52.841
I mean, all those people
and it's my fault.

35:52.865 --> 35:56.265
Esther, try not to think about why.

35:56.289 --> 36:01.666
Let's pretend
that we are looking for old friends.

36:02.423 --> 36:06.124
Our friend that we're looking for
would be right there.

36:06.344 --> 36:09.547
Now, whom do you know?

36:10.014 --> 36:13.882
Listen to you
using the objective case properly.

36:14.894 --> 36:18.037
Oh! Oh, look. That's Captain Hogue.

36:18.061 --> 36:20.058
There. There with the backpack.

36:20.775 --> 36:22.494
Callen.

36:22.518 --> 36:25.232
Hollywood Town Centre.

36:25.905 --> 36:28.740
Eric, could you go back
to the last feed?

36:32.912 --> 36:35.214
Callen, level six.

36:35.238 --> 36:40.931
Tall Caucasian male,
30s, bald, yellow backpack.

36:40.955 --> 36:42.848
I can't see him.

36:42.872 --> 36:45.063
Guys, he's forcing himself
to walk casually,

36:45.087 --> 36:47.191
but he's trying to hide
an adrenaline surge.

36:47.215 --> 36:49.461
This guy is moments away
from deploying.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.432
I got him.
He's heading for the food court.

37:07.197 --> 37:10.234
Hey, can I just take this
for a second? Thank you.

37:11.535 --> 37:14.702
- Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Unh!
- Ugh!

37:20.043 --> 37:22.250
Everybody down!

37:23.881 --> 37:25.708
Everybody down!

37:28.928 --> 37:30.505
Run! Run!

37:35.809 --> 37:37.601
- Get out of the way!
- No, no, no.

37:38.062 --> 37:39.093
No!

37:51.701 --> 37:53.325
Hey.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.177
Sam!

38:03.201 --> 38:04.660
Keep the vial in the water.

38:06.215 --> 38:07.223
Keep it out of the air.

38:07.247 --> 38:09.631
We stay right here
till HAZMAT scrubs us.

38:14.474 --> 38:15.730
You know I hate needles.

38:15.754 --> 38:18.579
It's an antidote, G.
I just saved your life.

38:18.603 --> 38:20.240
I don't even get a warning?

38:20.264 --> 38:22.347
Oh, now I gotta warn you
to save your life?

38:23.775 --> 38:25.909
Just keep the vial underwater.

38:25.933 --> 38:27.201
Understood, director.

38:27.225 --> 38:29.645
That's why I like my job.

38:30.865 --> 38:32.360
Okay. Got it.

38:35.829 --> 38:38.296
The FBI is doing the press conference
announcing the arrest

38:38.320 --> 38:39.589
of Troyger and the others.

38:39.613 --> 38:43.705
And stealing our credit.
That was all us. Sam and you and me.

38:44.337 --> 38:45.642
Right.

38:45.666 --> 38:47.417
But we don't exist.

38:48.133 --> 38:50.682
That's why you like your job.
Because we don't exist.

38:50.706 --> 38:53.591
I like my job because I never
have to do press conferences.

38:55.223 --> 38:57.928
Well, it's true.
You do have a better face for radio.

39:03.524 --> 39:07.735
Miss Blye, if you touch that thermostat,
it will be to turn it down.

39:08.278 --> 39:11.090
But I'm cold and Callen was pushed
in a fountain today.

39:11.114 --> 39:15.742
Which is exactly why we need
cost-cutting.

39:16.286 --> 39:20.201
The koi fish in that fountain
went belly-up from the botulinum.

39:21.083 --> 39:24.808
Oh, dear. One so rarely uses
that phrase literally.

39:24.832 --> 39:26.390
Poor things.

39:26.414 --> 39:30.942
Anyway, the mall has billed us
$72,000.

39:30.966 --> 39:33.483
- For fish?
- Yes.

39:33.507 --> 39:35.921
Do you know what I could buy
with that?

39:36.265 --> 39:38.472
I have a pretty good idea.

39:39.769 --> 39:44.905
Apparently, they're a prized lineage
of Taisho Sanke from Japan.

39:44.929 --> 39:46.957
The dead fish will be here
in the morning,

39:46.981 --> 39:48.943
so I can see them myself.

39:50.822 --> 39:55.448
What? I know the difference
between koi and carp and crap.

39:57.745 --> 39:58.776
All done.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.928
My psychological evaluation
of Esther Balmore

40:02.952 --> 40:05.747
and my strong recommendation
that she not be charged.

40:06.504 --> 40:08.912
She thought she was serving
her country.

40:09.924 --> 40:12.047
She won't be charged.

40:15.638 --> 40:16.943
That's not all she needs, though.

40:16.967 --> 40:19.654
I mean,
someone to adjust her medications,

40:19.678 --> 40:21.226
consistent home nursing.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.540
Yeah.

40:25.564 --> 40:26.847
I'll take care of it.

40:44.126 --> 40:49.523
You've come to offer to call the ADA
for Esther Balmore

40:49.547 --> 40:54.400
because you think
watching an old lady go batty

40:54.424 --> 40:56.587
has set off a nerve in me.

40:58.015 --> 41:01.598
I came for a cup of tea
because I'm cold.

41:08.817 --> 41:11.166
You know, in nursing homes
they only have tea in bags.

41:11.190 --> 41:13.817
So it just taste like paper.

41:14.532 --> 41:18.256
When the time comes,
I'll bring you the good stuff.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.255
Smuggle it in if I have to.

41:20.279 --> 41:23.325
Ah. Go undercover?

41:24.166 --> 41:26.206
As an orderly?

41:26.419 --> 41:28.376
Whatever you need.

41:36.888 --> 41:38.002
You know,

41:38.681 --> 41:41.765
it's not the loneliness I fear.

41:43.478 --> 41:44.912
But you are scared of something.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.456
Yes.

41:46.480 --> 41:50.491
Spilling everything I know.

41:50.515 --> 41:53.836
All my secrets being blathered out
into a world

41:53.860 --> 41:55.987
that should never hear them.

41:58.535 --> 42:01.049
So when the times comes,
as you put it,

42:01.073 --> 42:03.238
there's something you can do.

42:03.998 --> 42:07.450
You can smother me with a pillow.

42:08.002 --> 42:11.952
Make sure it's synthetic.
I'm allergic to feathers.

42:12.632 --> 42:14.126
Okay.

42:17.512 --> 42:21.023
Oh, the birds will be so happy.

42:21.047 --> 42:24.320
The delivery man just left them
out front

42:24.344 --> 42:26.927
and I just couldn't move them.

42:28.815 --> 42:31.520
You are so kind, Steve.

42:34.613 --> 42:35.692
That's not it.

42:37.991 --> 42:39.154
What is it, dear?

42:39.618 --> 42:41.160
I'm Sam.

42:41.578 --> 42:44.615
Sam. Right.

42:46.959 --> 42:48.501
Sam.

42:49.128 --> 42:51.262
Uh, say, Sam?

42:51.286 --> 42:52.815
Yes.

42:52.839 --> 42:55.758
- This stone fountain.
- Mm-hm.

42:56.135 --> 43:01.675
Don't you think it would look better
if it was over there?

43:04.476 --> 43:06.019
Sure.

43:06.687 --> 43:08.763
Piece of cake, Esther.

43:16.155 --> 43:18.776
Oh, careful, Steve.
