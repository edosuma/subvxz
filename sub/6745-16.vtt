13:10.624 --> 13:13.892
My mother tried to tell me
where she left my sisters,

13:13.894 --> 13:19.130

out the door and locked it.

beating my mother.

she was screaming,

head with a cutting board.

There's no history
of violent crime,

so if he did kill Cory,
that was a departure.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.977

detective Andrew Flynn, LAPD.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.354
Please raise
your right hand.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.656
And do you solemnly swear
that you'll tell the truth,

20:25.658 --> 20:27.525

and nothing but the truth,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.161
I do.
Please take a seat.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.167
Lieutenant, you heard
the material witness

20:36.169 --> 20:37.635
give evidence
here yesterday

20:37.637 --> 20:40.171
describing how she watched
the defendant

20:40.173 --> 20:42.440
as he started drowning
mariana Wallace

20:42.442 --> 20:44.242
in a swimming pool.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.410
Did you find any physical
evidence to support her story?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.547
Yes, when we discovered
the body of mariana Wallace,

20:49.549 --> 20:52.483
she had a little silver-and-blue
barrette in her hair.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.453
When we located the pool
where she was drowned,

20:55.455 --> 20:58.956
we found a matching barrette
inside the pool skimmer.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.692
The witness said
mariana was held underwater

21:01.694 --> 21:03.160
for over a minute.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.129
Is that enough time
to kill someone?

21:05.131 --> 21:08.099
If a person is panicking,
struggling for their life,

21:08.101 --> 21:11.102
fighting
to get out of the pool,

21:11.104 --> 21:12.470
it's more
than enough time.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.172
Let me explain.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.758
Now,
that was 10 seconds.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.726
You multiply that
times six,

21:35.728 --> 21:38.763
and that's how long
this 15-year-old girl

21:38.765 --> 21:42.633
had her head held underwater,
unable to breathe.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.269
And that's also how long
the murderer had

21:45.271 --> 21:47.004
to change his mind --

21:47.006 --> 21:50.174
to stop,
to let mariana go.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.642
Your honor, I object.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.711
Is there a question in there
somewhere?

21:53.713 --> 21:56.480
Provenza:
We're desperate to understand
what's going on here,

21:56.482 --> 21:58.349
and we're looking
for a little clarity.

21:58.351 --> 22:02.253
Did you let your no-good son
plan and commit this robbery

22:02.255 --> 22:05.189
and then knock him off
for getting caught?

22:05.191 --> 22:07.458
Sharon:
Now that we know who's involved
in this little conspiracy...

22:07.460 --> 22:10.394
She's taking her right
to remain silent very seriously.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.796
So did her son.

22:11.798 --> 22:15.032
If Cory died as a direct result
of this robbery,

22:15.034 --> 22:16.701
this is felony murder.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.736
And your little
get-rich-quick scheme --

22:18.738 --> 22:20.738
this was never
about getting rich!

22:20.740 --> 22:22.406
You really think
I'm the kind of mother

22:22.408 --> 22:23.774
who's gonna trade my son
for money?

22:23.776 --> 22:25.476
Why were you looking
for a bag of jewels

22:25.478 --> 22:27.745
instead of looking for the man
who killed your son?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.413
Because
I had to be sure.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.515
Sure of what?

22:31.517 --> 22:33.117
Be sure
that he had killed Cory!

22:33.119 --> 22:36.087
I had to be sure that he had
stolen the diamonds!

22:36.089 --> 22:38.689
I had to be sure that I was
another mark to him --

22:38.691 --> 22:40.358
that he didn't love me.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.493
I mean,
my God, I trusted him,

22:42.495 --> 22:44.829
and my son is dead
because of it!

22:44.831 --> 22:47.164
So you
and missing Marvin --

22:47.166 --> 22:48.499
his name isn't Marvin.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.101
His name is Avery cook,

22:50.103 --> 22:52.603
and we've been in a relationship
for over a year.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.305
So, this robbery --

22:54.307 --> 22:57.241
you, Avery,
and your son...

22:57.243 --> 22:58.542
You're in it together.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.643
Is that right?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.249
It was all Avery's idea.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.151
<i> I guess</i>
<i>he was just using us.</i>

23:07.153 --> 23:09.387
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i>that we didn't see him coming.</i>

23:09.389 --> 23:11.655
Words on
Mr. Avery's tombstone --

23:11.657 --> 23:13.391
"they never saw me coming."

23:13.393 --> 23:14.658
<i> I was so fooled.</i>

23:14.660 --> 23:16.360
<i>When Cory disappeared,</i>
<i> Avery said</i>

23:16.362 --> 23:19.497
that he went to the stash spot
at the restaurant

23:19.499 --> 23:21.098
and that it was empty.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.867
He said that Cory had run off
with the diamonds

23:22.869 --> 23:26.270
and left us with $900,000
worth of bail to make up for.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.139
I feel kind of bad
for her.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.841
Assuming we have
Mr. Romeo's true identity,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.210
he's Avery cook
of Camden, New Jersey.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.514
<i>Avery killed Cory and took</i>
<i>the diamonds for himself.</i>

23:36.516 --> 23:38.749
Do you know
where Avery is right now?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.718
He's probably
halfway around the world

23:40.720 --> 23:43.320
with a new identity.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.755
For what it's worth,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.525
he's supposed to be at
the affiliate motel in Burbank,

23:47.527 --> 23:49.393
using that Marvin name.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.629
<i>And I'm supposed to be</i>
<i>waiting for Cory to come home.</i>

23:51.631 --> 23:54.331
And quietly, in case he's gone
out and intends to come back.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.666
I'll send you a warrant
en route.

and not to show up --

for all of us to go

24:02.508 --> 24:04.608
as soon as I found Cory.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.278
He probably just wanted
a huge head start.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.813
Okay.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.615
Why don't you
write that all down,

24:11.617 --> 24:14.418
and we'll double-check it
when we find Marvin.

No. Not really.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.298

Oh, well,

I was gonna say "that's a lie,"
but it's a huge exaggeration.

25:38.571 --> 25:39.937
That's all.
It's --

25:39.939 --> 25:42.239
a couple of weeks ago,
over dinner,

25:42.241 --> 25:44.308
I told Cory and Selma
about my friend

25:44.310 --> 25:46.443
who's a concierge
at this fancy hotel.

25:46.445 --> 25:49.780
And I mentioned
all the crazy things she did.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.449

25:52.451 --> 25:55.352
for this famous jeweler
to move his diamonds.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.821

that Cory would, you know,

to rob somebody.

if they'll be unanimous

29:38.077 --> 29:39.877

I just want this to be over,

29:48.687 --> 29:51.221
and I know
Bobby Monroe would appeal.

29:52.224 --> 29:56.994

about your story on slider?

No.

Andy's testimony, so...

with his phone?

30:07.273 --> 30:09.339
You couldn't call,
you couldn't text?

Without Gus, you would've
never found out who Alice was.

And now
you're almost ignoring him

30:22.221 --> 30:23.987

it's somehow inconvenient.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.823
Look at me!

That is not a good way to
maintain serious relationships.

for the jury to come back,

and she returned from work.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.717

at the insurance-company office

30:53.719 --> 30:55.085
said
she pulled her shift.

that day.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.791

file a report

to the crime?

about the guy in prison

where we found Cory's body?

is Jose vasquez, 51.

no criminal connection

Selma can explain it all to us.

Maybe we should also look into
Mr. vasquez's finances.

I may need them
to make a deal.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.986
So, the LAPD lied to me?

need to find your son's killer.

for you.

answer one question truthfully.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.014

find Cory's killer?

32:31.016 --> 32:33.050
But only
if you're honest with us.

Otherwise, we won't be able
to do any follow-up,

to know?

what happens to Avery?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.417
Does he get
a reduced charge, too?

33:07.419 --> 33:10.821
No, but you can visit him
wherever he winds up.

33:10.823 --> 33:14.191
In fact, you can talk to him
when we're done here.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.192

but she said no.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.301
She said
this bail was too high.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.836
And I was desperate,

33:25.838 --> 33:28.138
'cause Cory was gonna
go away to jail for years,

33:28.140 --> 33:30.707

all mine and Avery's idea.

very mad at me, but...

Cory's mom gave you two diamonds
to bail her son out of jail.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.043
And you knew
where Selma lived

35:13.045 --> 35:14.277
because
she'd put up her house

35:14.279 --> 35:16.179
as collateral
for Cory's bail before.

why Cory had been arrested.

pulled out a gun,

to the rest of the diamonds

when we arrest you for murder,

I'm gonna personally see to it
that you're held<i> without</i> bond.

38:36.048 --> 38:37.514
Did I make it?

He's been pacing out here
with hobbs all morning.

to anyone

Okay.

How are you?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.708
I was relieved
for a second.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.744
But nothing that happens here
can bring mariana back.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.579
And we still don't know
the end.

40:16.581 --> 40:20.216

gonna do the right thing here.

Wait, wait, wait.

You -- you can't call me
for the trial.

The trial is over.
This is for sentencing.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.437
I need you to speak about
your relationship with Greg

40:40.439 --> 40:42.172

as a person.

Relationship?
W-what relationship?

you could talk
about his childhood,

about his inability
to read,

40:50.615 --> 40:52.582
about his disconnected view
of reality.
