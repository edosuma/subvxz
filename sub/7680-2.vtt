00:24.125 --> 00:26.616
People usually go to a junkyard

00:27.125 --> 00:28.615
looking for a bargain.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.616
I did.

00:30.625 --> 00:33.116
When I got my first set of wheels,

00:33.125 --> 00:36.117
one of them was kind of flat.

00:44.125 --> 00:47.663
I spent a lot of time
at hubcap heaven

00:47.667 --> 00:50.659
piecing together that first car.

00:50.667 --> 00:54.114
So would anybody else
looking for a real bargain.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.658
Like a matched set
of top secret

00:56.667 --> 00:58.658
Pentagon missile launch codes.

01:13.166 --> 01:18.160
Of course, missiles come in
all kinds of sizes and shapes.

01:18.166 --> 01:20.157
I've always been partial
to round.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.702
Stay here!

01:25.709 --> 01:28.701
See anything?

01:32.166 --> 01:34.157
Anything?

01:41.709 --> 01:45.201
As long as you keep
a grip on things...

01:45.709 --> 01:48.701
Briefcase! Gone! Up there!

02:04.208 --> 02:06.199
There he is!

02:10.208 --> 02:12.199
Get him!

02:20.750 --> 02:24.743
The thing about a junkyard
is the treasure you find

02:24.750 --> 02:28.242
is liable to be something
another fellow lost.

02:28.250 --> 02:32.243
And sometimes
he wants it back... real bad.

02:49.792 --> 02:53.785
Now, I've always got
thestartof a plan.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.783
Of course,
sometimes plans don't work out.

03:08.792 --> 03:11.283
But you always know for sure

03:11.291 --> 03:14.783
when they hit you
right in the... face.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.290
Go on!

04:07.875 --> 04:11.868
Now, you may find this
hard to believe,

04:11.875 --> 04:13.866
but there have been times

04:13.875 --> 04:16.332
when I've had a lot more fun
in the backseat of a car.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.408
I think the last thing
I wanted to do

05:16.917 --> 05:18.908
before these guys left the party

05:18.917 --> 05:20.908
was to find
the nicest way I could

05:21.417 --> 05:22.907
to lift their spirits.

06:12.001 --> 06:14.447
Yeah! It's MacGyver.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.995
You know
that diplomatic security case

06:17.001 --> 06:19.447
you guys put me on awhile back?

06:19.458 --> 06:23.451
Well, I got it...
and the boys who took it.

06:24.001 --> 06:27.493
Yeah.
Want to come pick 'em up?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.991
I just did.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.074
It's my humble opinion

08:08.083 --> 08:12.076
that old Alexander Graham Bell
has a lot to answer for.

08:12.083 --> 08:15.075
Getting away from it all
gets tougher and tougher.

08:15.083 --> 08:18.075
Not just the newspapers,
the telephone

08:18.083 --> 08:21.575
and the radio... but people.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.073
It's hard.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.620
Maybe impossible.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.619
Good morning, MacGyver.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.081
Ever been to Burma?

08:33.082 --> 08:36.075
You'll be going
deep into wild country.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.073
There's no government, no law.

08:38.082 --> 08:41.075
Just two kinds of people--
opium vendors

08:41.082 --> 08:43.620
and the local people
they hold as slaves.

08:43.625 --> 08:47.117
Sounds like you're sending me
to a real nice neighborhood.

08:47.125 --> 08:50.117
Well, it's dangerous,
but important. Very.

08:50.125 --> 08:54.619
I hear it's also sweaty and hot.
Very.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.115
No place to buy a condo.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.116
The cargo plane hit hard.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.616
Pieces scattered
all over the jungle.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.617
The main thing
is we lost a canister of toxin.

09:03.625 --> 09:06.662
Enough heavy-duty poison
to destroy 1,000 acres

09:06.667 --> 09:09.659
of plant life,
animals and people.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.659
And you'd kind of like
to have it back.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.123
Get it if you can.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.116
Destroy it if you have to.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.662
We'll have a pickup chopper
come for you

09:18.667 --> 09:20.658
24 hours after you drop in.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.123
Don't be late, MacGyver...

09:22.125 --> 09:23.661
or you won't be back.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.155
Ah, shucks.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.656
I guess this means

09:27.166 --> 09:28.155
I won't
have time to do any shopping.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.702
Slavery.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.155
It's just a word--

10:00.166 --> 10:02.157
something
out of ancient history--

10:02.166 --> 10:03.702
until you see it.

10:03.709 --> 10:04.698
Get a close look

10:05.208 --> 10:07.699
at human beings
treated like animals.

10:10.208 --> 10:13.200
Oh, grandfather!

10:25.208 --> 10:27.199
Leave him alone!

10:37.750 --> 10:39.741
Is there trouble, sir?

10:40.208 --> 10:43.200
You told me you could get
your people to work hard,

10:43.208 --> 10:44.744
harvest the opium.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.741
This one
can't even walk.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.240
I'm all right.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.240
Please.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.241
Come, Grandfather.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.741
I can walk.

11:05.792 --> 11:07.783
Grandfather!

11:14.250 --> 11:16.241
Oh!

11:16.250 --> 11:18.241
I am sorry!

11:18.250 --> 11:21.242
Keep them moving!

11:21.792 --> 11:23.783
Hurry!
Back to the village! Move!

11:30.291 --> 11:31.781
Oh!

11:31.792 --> 11:34.784
Shh! Quiet.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.282
Quiet!

11:47.834 --> 11:49.825
It's all right.

11:52.291 --> 11:56.284
It's all right.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.828
I'm on your side.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.280
Just want to ask you
about this red hat.

12:08.834 --> 12:09.823
Come on, now.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.823
I just helped you
out of a little jam.

12:11.834 --> 12:12.823
Is that any way to thank me?

12:12.834 --> 12:14.324
That's gratitude.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.324
Nice guy.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.324
Who are you?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.324
Name's MacGyver.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.869
Chan.
Good to meet you.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.322
I apologize.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.324
No problem.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.324
Now, you want to tell
me where you got the hat?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.324
I will show you.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.332
Who was that guy
that was chasing you?

12:35.333 --> 12:38.325
He is Truang,
General Narai's dog.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.325
He in charge of forced labor
for the poppy fields?

12:41.333 --> 12:42.869
Yes.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.869
And who's Narai,
his boss?

12:44.875 --> 12:47.867
They say
General Narai is not human.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.867
They say
he drinks blood.

12:53.375 --> 12:57.368
This is where I find my red hat,
MacGyver.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.907
Of course.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.908
Poison canister's gone.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.909
Pentagon's not going
to be too happy.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.453
You're lucky, boy.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.949
I don't have time
to punish you now.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.948
Did he hurt you?

14:11.959 --> 14:13.449
Who is that?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.948
I know who you are

14:23.458 --> 14:24.994
and what you are doing here,

14:25.001 --> 14:26.992
so do not lie.

14:27.001 --> 14:28.457
French?

14:29.001 --> 14:31.447
English?

14:31.458 --> 14:34.450
American.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.447
Well, take your pick.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.994
Wherever you come from,

14:38.001 --> 14:41.448
I know what you are,
narcotics agent.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.447
A what?

14:42.458 --> 14:43.447
Your kind have been

14:43.458 --> 14:46.495
in our area before.
I know.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.991
The general is coming!

14:52.001 --> 14:53.491
Get everything ready!

14:53.500 --> 14:54.489
The storeroom.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.491
He will want to see the opium.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.491
His guns-- make sure
his guns are ready.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.489
Move!

14:59.500 --> 15:02.492
Move! Move!

15:42.542 --> 15:46.034
A long time ago,
my cousin Allie got a dog

15:46.041 --> 15:49.533
from the pound--
part Airedale, part Spaniel.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.534
Real cute...
but she'd been beaten.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.531
All that puppy knew how to do

15:56.041 --> 15:59.533
was cower, cringe away
from you, expecting to be hit.

16:02.542 --> 16:05.579
It's a real ugly thing
to see in a dog.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.578
It's even worse
in a human being.

16:20.041 --> 16:24.034
This is something
I did not expect.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.076
Who are you?

16:25.083 --> 16:27.574
Name's MacGyver.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.575
And I'll just bet
you're General Narai.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.575
That was a nice landing, General.

16:33.583 --> 16:36.074
Little flashy,
but effective.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.573
He's a narcotics agent!

16:37.583 --> 16:39.574
I made him speak.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.616
The poppies?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.616
Only half the harvest is complete.

16:56.625 --> 17:00.072
You radioed about downed
American airplane...

17:00.083 --> 17:01.619
with weapons.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.116
Bingo!

17:23.625 --> 17:25.115
Good.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.657
Very good.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.124
My helicopter will become a gunship,

17:30.667 --> 17:33.124
a powerful weapon.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.123
Load 'em.

17:38.667 --> 17:42.660
You wish to tell me
the real reason you're here?

17:42.667 --> 17:44.658
Tourist?

17:50.166 --> 17:51.656
I like a sense of humor.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.158
Shows spirit.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.158
Five days, and my caravan
will come here

17:57.166 --> 17:58.656
to pick up the opium.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.658
Finish the harvest.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.658
And if you're not ready...

18:02.667 --> 18:03.656
They are slow.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.703
Too many old men and women.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.155
Lazy children.
They are stubborn.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.157
Headman!

18:16.166 --> 18:18.157
Are your people slow,

18:18.166 --> 18:20.157
stubborn?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.157
I've told them, General.

18:22.166 --> 18:25.704
I-I've warned them
you'd be angry.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.698
I care for you.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.700
I give you protection,

18:32.709 --> 18:35.701
food, shelter.

18:35.709 --> 18:38.200
But as children
are responsible

18:38.208 --> 18:40.199
to their father,

18:40.709 --> 18:43.701
you must not disappoint me,

18:43.709 --> 18:46.200
hurt me.

18:47.208 --> 18:50.200
If I suffer...

18:50.208 --> 18:54.201
you will suffer.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.199
We will bring in the crops,
I promise.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.199
Good.

18:58.208 --> 19:03.748
Just to remind all of you
how important this is...

19:03.750 --> 19:05.741
I will give you an example.

19:08.750 --> 19:13.244
Stake our narcotics agent
out at the head of the trail.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.741
No food, no water.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.242
Every morning you go to work,

19:21.250 --> 19:22.740
every evening you come back,

19:22.750 --> 19:26.242
you can watch him dying.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.787
He will inspire you to work.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.242
I will return in five days...

19:35.792 --> 19:38.249
...and with luck,

19:38.250 --> 19:40.787
you may live the entire five days...

19:43.250 --> 19:45.787
...but I doubt it.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.829
My mom used to make
a great broiled chicken.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.280
One of my favorites.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.825
Funny.
I'm starting to feel

20:11.291 --> 20:15.284
real sympathetic
towards them chickens.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.322
I'll watch.

20:31.333 --> 20:35.326
MacGyver, her name Lin,
my sister.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.323
Hi.

20:36.834 --> 20:37.823
Chan has told me

20:37.834 --> 20:38.823
how you helped him,

20:38.834 --> 20:40.825
We're very grateful.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.325
Well, you're very welcome.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.331
Now, if you wanted to cut me loose,

20:46.875 --> 20:48.331
I bet we could call it even.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.332
I'm sorry. I can't.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.331
If we help you escape,

20:54.875 --> 20:57.332
Narai will kill
many of our people.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.871
MacGyver,
you don't know Narai.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.331
He has burned entire villages

21:02.333 --> 21:04.324
and massacred many people

21:04.333 --> 21:07.871
because they refused
to harvest his opium poppies.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.367
He is very rich and powerful.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.866
We have no way to fight him.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.365
I would fight.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.367
I bet you would, champ.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.366
They are coming!

21:22.875 --> 21:26.367
Lin, please,
come now!

21:34.375 --> 21:37.913
Been wondering
when somebody'd show up.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.374
Getting some good rays here.

22:10.959 --> 22:13.951
You must work faster!
Faster!

22:19.959 --> 22:22.416
Work faster, Ming,
you lazy boy!

22:22.417 --> 22:25.955
We only have four
days left to harvest!

22:38.959 --> 22:39.948
Where did you get that?

22:40.458 --> 22:42.449
I stole it back from guard house.

22:42.959 --> 22:45.450
For MacGyver,
or he will die out there.

23:15.001 --> 23:17.993
Ho.
Go to the narcotics agent and relieve

24:03.000 --> 24:04.536
Be careful!

24:15.542 --> 24:20.036
For a second,
I thought you were truly stupid,boy.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.032
Are you?

24:24.041 --> 24:27.033
Are you a stupid boy?

25:46.125 --> 25:47.661
When I was a kid,

25:48.125 --> 25:50.116
one of the big events
of the country fair

25:50.125 --> 25:53.663
was watching a lot of optimists
trying to catch a greased pig.

25:53.667 --> 25:56.124
It was a lot of fun.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.662
It sure keeps a crowd occupied.

27:01.709 --> 27:05.748
Now let's try a little
chain reaction action here.

27:12.208 --> 27:14.199
Now I'll get this signal flare

27:14.208 --> 27:16.199
tucked under the airplane tire.

27:16.750 --> 27:19.742
It should serve nicely
as a delayed fuse.

27:21.208 --> 27:23.745
And a little air
pumped into the life jacket...

27:39.750 --> 27:43.242
The boat inflates... hopefully.

27:55.792 --> 27:59.785
Signal flare pops, and yes...

27:59.792 --> 28:01.248
the big bang.

28:22.291 --> 28:24.282
No, Chan!

28:28.834 --> 28:30.290
Ming, he needs help!

29:36.875 --> 29:38.365
Well, I guess that's it, then.

29:39.875 --> 29:41.866
Now you're free.

29:41.875 --> 29:45.914
No.
Truang will reach
General Narai's convoy.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.908
They will return very soon.

29:48.375 --> 29:49.911
You...

29:49.917 --> 29:51.373
you have destroyed us all!

30:19.792 --> 30:23.785
MacGyver, maybe you can teach us
how to use these guns.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.783
No, I don't think so.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.783
It takes a couple of weeks or so

30:31.792 --> 30:33.783
to train a soldier
how to use a rifle.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.280
We need no training.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.282
We need you to leave now
before it gets worse.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.827
So, go! Just go!

30:40.834 --> 30:43.291
Is that the way all of you feel?

30:43.291 --> 30:44.827
If we cannot find our souls,

30:44.834 --> 30:46.825
we do not deserve our lives.

30:50.291 --> 30:52.282
Thank you for what you have done,
MacGyver.

30:52.291 --> 30:54.282
You need not thank him.

30:54.291 --> 30:57.283
Just pray that Narai
does not kill us all!

31:01.333 --> 31:04.825
You know,
I think you folks ought to decide

31:04.834 --> 31:06.825
which way you're going to go now.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.825
I promised a man
I'd do a job for him.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.324
That's what I got to do.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.870
I got a chopper to meet.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.870
Everyone,

31:27.875 --> 31:29.331
it will be all right.

31:29.333 --> 31:33.326
When General Narai comes back,
we will apologize.

31:33.333 --> 31:42.375
We will beg him to forgive us.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.865
42-23 Alpha.

31:44.375 --> 31:47.367
Looks like MacGyver's got the goods.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.865
Going in.

32:21.917 --> 32:23.908
MacGyver!

32:28.917 --> 32:31.408
Easy, big guy.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.908
I wasn't going anywhere.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.407
I was a hunter.

32:36.417 --> 32:38.408
I have been a farmer.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.953
Now I'm a slave.

32:39.959 --> 32:40.948
You are alive.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.415
At Narai's whim.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.953
Ming is right.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.415
Narai controls our lives,

32:45.417 --> 32:46.953
and everything else.

32:46.959 --> 32:48.950
This is a useless conversation.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.415
We have no means to fight.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.406
And your great hope,

32:51.417 --> 32:53.408
MacGyver, has gone.

32:53.417 --> 32:54.406
Grandfather! Lin!

32:54.417 --> 32:55.953
MacGyver is back!

33:10.458 --> 33:12.949
I've finished the job
I was sent here to do.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.449
What have you all decided?

33:14.458 --> 33:16.449
Are you going
to keep peeling poppies,

33:16.458 --> 33:19.450
or are we going to give
this fashion-plate Narai

33:19.458 --> 33:20.994
a run for his money?

33:26.458 --> 33:29.450
Teach me to be a soldier,
MacGyver.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.995
You are fools!

33:32.001 --> 33:32.990
All of you!

33:33.458 --> 33:34.994
You will suffer!

33:35.001 --> 33:37.447
Narai will kill you!

33:41.500 --> 33:42.489
Listen, folks,

33:43.001 --> 33:44.992
I don't think we have much more
than a few hours

33:45.500 --> 33:46.990
before old Truang
spreads the good news.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.991
You said we cannot learn
to shoot in time.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.990
How do we fight?

33:53.500 --> 33:57.493
Oh, I've got a couple ideas.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.489
A little higher.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.989
That's good.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.991
That is to be seen.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.991
Excellent.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.490
Yes, yes, yes, here,

34:07.500 --> 34:08.989
take this up to the ridge.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.491
Signal us
as soon as you see the convoy.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.491
It is Narai!

34:19.000 --> 34:20.536
He's checking us out.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.998
Heading north.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.536
Yes, heading north
to process his opium.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.991
Let's hope they keep him busy
for awhile.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.536
Truang should reach that convoy
in a bit.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.992
Now, this is how you cut
the bandits down to size.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.536
Teamwork.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.033
The women and children
are cooking up

34:48.041 --> 34:51.533
a bamboo buffet--
a giant wooden flute

34:51.542 --> 34:54.534
filled with fire ash
and rice alcohol.

34:54.542 --> 34:57.534
Guaranteed to bring tears
to the eyes.

35:08.583 --> 35:10.039
How's it going?

35:10.041 --> 35:12.578
Fine.
Except for the guns.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.574
I set traps like this
when I was a boy.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.577
That's why you're in charge.

35:16.583 --> 35:19.575
Ah, you have given Ming
a chance to become a man.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.074
I can see the change in him--

35:22.083 --> 35:24.074
from a slave to a leader.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.072
Okay,

35:30.083 --> 35:32.074
go now.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.081
Is it deep enough?

35:53.083 --> 35:54.619
That is perfect.

35:54.625 --> 35:56.081
Perfect.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.074
But they can see it,though.

35:58.083 --> 36:00.620
That's what makes it perfect.

36:17.625 --> 36:19.661
A good morning's work.

36:19.667 --> 36:23.114
My... people did a good job.

36:28.667 --> 36:30.658
The signal.

36:30.667 --> 36:31.656
All right.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.661
I don't think we've got
more than an hour

36:33.667 --> 36:35.658
before Truang
and his goons get here.

36:35.667 --> 36:38.659
What shall we do now?

36:43.667 --> 36:45.157
Get some food.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.157
First we eat...

36:47.166 --> 36:49.157
then we fight.

37:35.709 --> 37:39.201
Hey!

37:39.208 --> 37:42.200
Uh,
it seems only fair to warn you

37:42.208 --> 37:44.745
that these folks don't want
you guys back here,

37:44.750 --> 37:46.741
so if you just want to turn around

37:46.750 --> 37:48.741
and go back to wherever you
came from, uh,

37:48.750 --> 37:50.741
these folks won't hold a grudge.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.745
But I got to warn you,
if, uh, you keep on coming,

37:53.750 --> 37:56.207
you're liable to have a battle
on your hands.

37:56.208 --> 37:59.245
So, what do you say?

37:59.250 --> 38:00.239
Whoa!

38:03.250 --> 38:06.742
Those guys are just spoiling
for a fight.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.741
Let's move.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.783
Herpetologists will tell you

38:43.792 --> 38:47.284
everyone has an inner fear
of snakes.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.781
Even true for the herpetologists.

38:48.792 --> 38:49.781
Now!

39:03.834 --> 39:06.826
Yow!

39:06.834 --> 39:10.827
Are you afraid of snake, MacGyver?

39:10.834 --> 39:12.290
No.

39:14.291 --> 39:16.828
I just don't like
being around 'em.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.826
Now, you take your psychologists.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.324
They'll tell you when someone thinks

39:33.333 --> 39:35.824
they have you all figured out,

39:35.834 --> 39:38.826
that's when they're
the most vulnerable.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.870
When it comes to Truang,

39:42.875 --> 39:46.868
he doesn't know an asp
from a hole in the ground.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.866
Come on, Truang,

40:01.875 --> 40:03.365
it can only get worse.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.866
Why don't we call it a day?

40:09.875 --> 40:11.866
He's only trying to bait us.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.366
We go to the village first.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.366
Then MacGyver.

40:41.417 --> 40:43.908
Hurry! Dismount!

40:43.917 --> 40:45.917
Move that tree out of the way!

40:45.917 --> 40:47.407
And, of course,
the archeologist tells us

40:47.417 --> 40:50.909
the wheel is man's greatest invention.

40:50.917 --> 40:54.409
I thought we'd blow the air
out of that notion.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.449
What are you waiting for?!

41:23.458 --> 41:26.950
Pick up your weapons!
Move out!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.491
General!

43:13.041 --> 43:17.535
Gentlemen, you're in time
for the buffet.

43:17.542 --> 43:20.579
Our short order cook
just turned on the gas.

47:18.291 --> 47:20.828
Now we are free.

47:21.834 --> 47:24.280
Yeah.
