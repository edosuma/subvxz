Why don't you just get a video

{\an1}How about
<i>Father of The Bride?</i>

{\an3}Donna, you've rented
that 50 times.

Why don't you
just buy it?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.818
Why don't we see a classic
for a change?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.528
{\an3}I'm going to go
look at the how-tos.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.851
Are you sure?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.227
Ooh, this is
disgusting.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.353
{\an3}Come on.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.229
{\an1}Donna?
Donna Martin?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.606
Is that you?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.525
Hi, Father Chris.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.442
Look at this.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.528
You're all grown up now.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.446
{\an3}Yep, 18.

02:36.489 --> 02:40.702
{\an1}So I see you're looking
for musical comedies.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.538
That's a joke.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.540
Oh.
Oh.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.417
Uh, David, this
is Father Chris.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
{\an3}He gave me my

02:49.669 --> 02:50.587
Hi.

Nice to meet you, David.

{\an6}DAVID:
Nice to meet
you, too.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.424
{\an1}Donna, why don't you
stop by some time?

Oh, my God.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.564
What?

{\an3}Oh, I don't
believe it.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.610
{\an1}Monsieur Rick.
What is he doing here?

03:13.693 --> 03:14.819
I don't know, Donna,
what am I gonna do?

03:14.903 --> 03:15.862
Hide me.

03:15.945 --> 03:16.821
{\an1}Um, Bren,
I hate to tell you,

03:16.905 --> 03:18.781
{\an1}but I don't think
you're gonna get out of here

03:18.865 --> 03:20.783
without him seeing you.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.619
You're right.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.413
Okay, whatever I say, whatever
I do, you guys just play along.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.414
Promise me?
Yeah.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.458
W-What is she
talking about?

03:28.541 --> 03:31.502
Oh, that's the guy
she met in Paris.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.837
So?

03:32.921 --> 03:34.964
So he thinks
she's French.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.302
{\an1}(French accent):
Rick?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.428
Brenda?

{\an3}Oh, my God.
Brenda DuBois.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.434
{\an3}I never thought
I'd see you again.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.518
What are you doing here?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.772
{\an3}I think that should be my
question, shouldn't it?

03:50.855 --> 03:53.358
Brenda, God...

03:53.441 --> 03:55.443
{\an3}It's, it's so
good to see you.

03:55.526 --> 04:01.157
{\an1}Well, I am visiting
my American relatives

04:01.240 --> 04:02.617
in Beverly Hills.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.494
{\an3}And I transferred
to UCLA.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.498
{\an1}Ah, so you did leave the cold
winters behind after all.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.541
Yes, I did.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.003
I cannot believe this
is actually happening.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.339
God...

04:16.422 --> 04:20.677
You know, I waited a long time
for you that morning in Paris.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.553
I know.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.596
I am sorry.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.265
{\an3}I thought I would
never see you again.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.395
So, how long are
you in town for?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.355
Just a few more days.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.357
Well, since you gave me
your tour of Paris,

04:34.440 --> 04:36.526
then I absolutely insist
that you let me

04:36.609 --> 04:38.069
give you my tour of LA.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.654
Rick, I don't know.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.531
I mean, I am leaving so soon.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.699
Come on, Brenda.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.492
I mean, here you are.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.576
Here I am.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.578
It's kismet.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.038
(normal voice):
What?

04:49.122 --> 04:50.039
{\an3}Fate.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.541
{\an3}Destiny.
Kismet.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.085
(chuckles)

04:54.168 --> 04:54.919
So where are you staying?

04:55.003 --> 04:59.048
With my aunt and uncle,
the Walshes.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.593
God, you are so beautiful.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.847
Thank you.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.559
Brenda, I still can't believe

05:09.642 --> 05:12.395
you spent $350 on
an SAT prep course

05:12.478 --> 05:14.564
{\an3}and your score in English
only went up 20 points.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.150
Ah, but who's counting?

05:17.233 --> 05:18.109
I don't know.

05:18.192 --> 05:18.901
You're the mathematician.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.903
{\an1}Tell me, what does
that work out to

05:20.987 --> 05:22.905
on a cost per basis?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.866
$17.50 a point.

05:24.949 --> 05:25.575
Thanks, Dad.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.661
{\an3}(telephone rings)
I'll get it.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.624
Hello.

05:35.668 --> 05:40.590
{\an1}Well, yes, she is,
may I ask who's calling?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.424
A boy named Rick wants

05:41.507 --> 05:43.634
{\an1}to know if
my niece Brenda

05:43.718 --> 05:45.928
is at home.
Oh, I'll get that.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.473
(Fench accent):
Bonjour, Rick.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.599
<i>Comment allez-vous?</i>

05:49.682 --> 05:52.393
Tonight? Uh...

05:52.477 --> 05:55.438
{\an1}No, I must have dinner
with my family.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.606
<i>Oui.</i>

05:56.689 --> 05:59.108
Saturday is still fine.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.610
{\an1}(French accent):
What's with the accent?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.445
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:05.031
{\an1}It is good to hear
from you, too.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.741
<i>A demain. Au revoir.</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:09.786
{\an3}ALL:
Brenda.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.454
Yes?

06:11.537 --> 06:13.456
Would you mind explaining
what that was all about?

06:13.539 --> 06:15.291
{\an3}Or are we gonna have
to beat it out of you?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.459
It was nothing.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.628
I just met this guy in Paris

06:18.711 --> 06:19.837
and I never thought
I'd see him again.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.798
So I pretended to be
French, that's all.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.257
That's all?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.134
Well, I thought that was all
until I bumped into him

06:25.218 --> 06:27.011
at a video store.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.347
{\an5}(French accent):
Ah, but you haven't
told him the truth?

06:29.430 --> 06:30.306
Mom, how could I?

06:30.389 --> 06:32.308
(French accent):
It would break his heart.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.142
{\an3}Well, I think you'd
better get ready

06:33.226 --> 06:35.436
{\an1}to say <i> "au revoir,</i>
<i>mademoiselle"</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:37.063
{\an3}because I think this guy
will probably freak

06:37.146 --> 06:38.481
when he finds out
you lied to him.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.482
He won't find out.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.608
{\an6}JIM:
That's right,
Brandon.

06:40.691 --> 06:41.609
{\an1}Don't you worry
about your sister.

06:41.692 --> 06:45.905
She knows exactly
what she's doing.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.673
Are you sure you don't want
me to hire a painter?

07:03.756 --> 07:06.509
{\an1}No, I want to do it.
It's fun.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.846
{\an1}Besides, it's not like
I have anything better to do.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.806
Kelly, what's
bothering you?

07:11.889 --> 07:14.225
{\an3}I would have thought
those SAT scores

07:14.308 --> 07:15.560
{\an5}would have put you
in a great mood.
I'm in a fine mood.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.562
{\an3}Honey...

07:17.645 --> 07:21.649
{\an3}happy teenagers do not
paint their rooms black.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.694
{\an1}The video said
it was dramatic.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.654
Kelly...

07:26.737 --> 07:27.864
{\an1}Come on.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.491
Talk to me.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.200
I don't know, Mother.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.744
{\an3}It's just, like,
you have Mel.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.122
Donna has David.

07:36.205 --> 07:36.873
Brenda has Dylan...

07:36.956 --> 07:39.417
and now some guy
she met in Paris

07:39.500 --> 07:40.168
shows up out of nowhere.

07:40.251 --> 07:40.751
{\an3}And so she's
juggling two guys

07:40.835 --> 07:42.545
and I have nobody.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.713
Honey...

07:43.796 --> 07:46.883
you're young, you're beautiful

07:46.966 --> 07:49.177
and you have your whole
life in front of you.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.554
You're gonna
meet someone.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.098
{\an3}Meeting someone
isn't my problem.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.058
I meet people every day.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.227
I just fall in love
with the wrong ones.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.563
Well, take it from somebody
who's been married five times.

08:00.646 --> 08:04.775
{\an1}You can't always control
who you fall in love with.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.738
{\an3}What do you do if it's
somebody you can't have?

08:08.821 --> 08:09.780
What's going on, Kel?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.575
{\an1}Who is he?

08:12.658 --> 08:15.077
Nobody.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.747
(baby crying)

08:17.830 --> 08:20.583
{\an3}It's okay, go ahead,
I'll be fine.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.501
{\an3}I have my whole life
ahead of me.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.724
Donna, isn't this
usually the point

08:36.807 --> 08:39.727
{\an3}where you tell me to
stop and go home?

08:41.854 --> 08:45.107
Oh, David...

08:45.191 --> 08:47.068
{\an3}You mean, you don't
want me to stop?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.277
No.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.572
I mean, I mean yes.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.659
{\an3}Look, if you're
ready, I am.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.744
{\an3}I mean, I,
I really am.

08:56.827 --> 09:00.623
{\an1}Well, I don't know
if I am yet.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.750
But you might be soon?

09:02.833 --> 09:05.628
I don't know.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.464
I'm sorry, David.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.969
{\an3}It's okay, you don't
have to apologize.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.053
{\an1}Well, how do you
think I feel?

09:14.136 --> 09:17.598
{\an1}I mean, I can't believe
I even let you in my bedroom.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.766
Well, how do you feel?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.393
Warm.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.435
Then what's
the problem?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.728
{\an3}Your parents
are out of town.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.272
{\an3}Neither of us
have any diseases

09:24.355 --> 09:25.314
{\an3}because we haven't
done it yet.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.775
{\an3}And I have protection,
so you won't get pregnant.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.859
There's more to it
than that, David.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.821
{\an1}I was brought up believing
I'd wait till I got married.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.823
I can't just wipe all that out
because of how my body feels.

09:33.906 --> 09:38.160
{\an3}Look, Donna,
you're 18, I'm 17.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.662
{\an3}Now, I don't know
how you feel,

09:39.745 --> 09:43.291
{\an3}but chances are I'm not gonna
be thinking about marriage

09:43.374 --> 09:44.000
for another ten years.

09:44.083 --> 09:48.337
{\an3}I just can't wait
that long.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.506
{\an3}Look, I gotta get
out of here.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.425
{\an3}All this making out
is getting to me.

09:54.593 --> 09:59.181
♪ Would you look
inside your heart? ♪

09:59.265 --> 10:03.811
♪ Would you start believing? ♪

10:03.894 --> 10:05.646
Can you believe it?

10:05.730 --> 10:06.814
{\an1}Donna went up 80 points
on her SATs.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.692
Yeah, that review course we
took really helped my score.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.818
How'd you do, Steve-o?

10:10.901 --> 10:11.861
About the same.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.362
Not so hot, huh?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.363
It'll do.

10:14.447 --> 10:14.822
{\an1}You know,
you're awfully quiet.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.823
How'd you do?

10:15.906 --> 10:18.576
{\an1}I don't know.
I haven't got 'em back yet.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.744
{\an1}I think it's 'cause I
took the test out of town.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.251
Brandon.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.462
Yeah, what's up?

10:29.545 --> 10:30.713
{\an1}Don't tell anybody
this, okay?

10:30.796 --> 10:31.714
What is it, Steve?

10:31.797 --> 10:35.676
{\an1}The truth of the matter is,
I bit it on my SATs.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.512
{\an3}How bad?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.431
Let's just say,
I can kiss SC good-bye.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.557
{\an1}Hey, Steve,
how's it going?

10:41.640 --> 10:42.808
{\an3}It's going.

10:45.061 --> 10:49.190
{\an1}Oh, how I love having
a freshman buddy.

10:49.273 --> 10:49.940
{\an3}You know, Steve, colleges
do look at other things

10:50.024 --> 10:52.860
besides your SAT scores.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.945
{\an1}It's not exactly like
I have the grades, either.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.614
Well, there are
other schools.

10:56.697 --> 10:57.740
Not in my family.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.908
Well, I guess that only

10:58.991 --> 11:00.034
{\an3}leaves one thing then,
doesn't it?

11:00.117 --> 11:01.535
What?

11:01.619 --> 11:02.953
Study.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.122
Thanks, pal.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.249
Anytime, brother.

11:07.333 --> 11:07.917
(groans)

11:28.312 --> 11:31.232
{\an3}Herbert, I'm sorry for
being such a jerk before.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.983
I've got a lot of
things on my mind.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.276
That's okay.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.653
{\an3}Look, I've got tickets
to the Raiders.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.028
{\an3}I thought maybe
you'd like to go.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.447
With you?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.282
Yeah, with me.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.742
Wow.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.243
That'd be great, thanks.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.869
It's no big deal.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.287
{\an3}I've got season
tickets.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.498
{\an1}So you really want
to hang out with me?

11:47.581 --> 11:49.417
Sure.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.543
You're a decent kid.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.294
{\an3}I'd like to get to
know you better.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.463
{\an3}You would?
Yeah.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.674
{\an3}All I know is that you're
into computers, right?

11:56.757 --> 11:57.466
You got it.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.593
{\an1}You're probably
some major hacker.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.803
{\an3}Yeah, I
guess so.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.640
Did you ever fantasize
about breaking into some

12:04.723 --> 12:06.642
{\an1}big company's
computer system?

12:06.725 --> 12:07.852
Something like that.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.688
Every hacker does.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.481
You know,
I hear they keep the grades

12:12.565 --> 12:13.649
in this school on a computer.

12:13.732 --> 12:14.191
Yeah.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.485
It's an IBM ES 9000

12:16.569 --> 12:18.487
with a string of PS2's on line.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.614
You really do know your stuff.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.326
{\an3}Can you imagine
what it'd be like

12:24.410 --> 12:26.120
to break into
that bad boy?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.122
{\an3}You could give yourself
any grade you wanted.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.208
But you probably couldn't

12:31.292 --> 12:34.044
{\an3}pull off something
that big.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.548
I, I could if
I wanted to.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.507
Yeah, right.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.593
Hey, the only thing
I need to know

12:40.676 --> 12:41.677
{\an3}is what the right
password is,

12:41.760 --> 12:43.971
{\an5}and everything else
is a piece of cake.
Oh...

12:44.054 --> 12:45.097
{\an1}like someone's gonna tell you
what the password is.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.725
{\an3}There are ways of finding
out what it is.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.644
{\an1}Oh, so it sounds intriguing,
doesn't it?

12:50.728 --> 12:51.979
{\an3}It sounds kind
of crazy.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.023
{\an1}But you could do it,
right?

12:54.106 --> 12:56.317
Yeah.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.486
Except this set-up
is a closed system.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.488
The only way to
gain access is

13:00.571 --> 13:02.156
{\an3}through an active
file server.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.824
What is that?

13:03.908 --> 13:06.035
Oh, it means if you wanted
to break into the computer,

13:06.118 --> 13:08.913
{\an3}first you'd have to
break into the school.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
Well, what would you do

13:12.124 --> 13:15.169
{\an1}if I told you I had
that end covered?

13:16.670 --> 13:19.715
{\an3}You're serious,
aren't you?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.844
(chuckling)

13:28.807 --> 13:29.850
Well, that's true,

13:29.934 --> 13:32.019
but if you take a quarter page
for a full month,

13:32.102 --> 13:33.062
we can give you a
break on the cost.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.189
{\an3}Absolutely.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.398
{\an3}Right.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.900
{\an1}All right,
this one's done.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.444
{\an6}Uh, could you hold
on a second, Mrs.
Taffet? Thanks.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.363
{\an4}So how's it look?
Well, it's not gonna win
any Pulitzer,

13:42.446 --> 13:44.365
but it's not bad
for a freshman.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.367
{\an1}Listen, uh, I've got a history
mid-term tomorrow,

13:46.450 --> 13:48.118
{\an5}mind if I cut out
of here?
Yeah,

13:48.202 --> 13:49.245
go ahead.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.663
As soon as I convince
Mrs. Taffet

13:50.746 --> 13:51.539
to buy some ad space,

13:51.622 --> 13:53.874
{\an5}I'm going
home, too.
You want a lift?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.084
No, I think I'll walk.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.252
Thanks, though.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.628
Cool. See you tomorrow, Chief.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.629
{\an3}(school bell rings)
Bye.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.139
{\an1}Andrea?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
Brandon.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.310
Hi.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.978
Are you okay?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.438
Mmm.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
{\an3}You just missed
my parents.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.153
What's all this?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.363
Two broken legs.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.365
Oh, wow.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.492
I'm really sorry.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.455
What happened?

15:14.538 --> 15:15.205
I was walking home from school,

15:15.289 --> 15:18.334
thinking how great my life is.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.047
Then, all of a sudden...

15:23.130 --> 15:26.091
all I remember is...

15:26.175 --> 15:29.386
this car coming straight at me.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.014
{\an3}They didn't
even stop.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.558
They just left me lying there.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.144
What do the police think?

15:37.227 --> 15:40.689
I'm lucky to be alive.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.692
Hey, listen,

15:43.776 --> 15:46.487
{\an1}anything you need,
you know I'm here, right?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.405
Thanks.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.198
{\an1}Okay.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.200
You want to stay awhile?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.078
As long as you want.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.215
{\an1}Come on, Herbert,
kids have been using

16:06.298 --> 16:09.218
{\an1}this key since the '60s--
it's not a big deal.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.011
{\an1}It's a tradition
around here.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.721
{\an3}I don't need to change
my grades, Steve.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.683
{\an5}I get straight A's.
So this is what I get
for helping you

16:15.766 --> 16:18.060
when you needed me, huh?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.229
{\an3}Getting my books back
from some bullies

16:20.312 --> 16:22.940
{\an3}isn't exactly the same
thing as breaking the law.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.150
{\an4}Oh. Well, how about
breaking out of
your wimp mold

16:25.234 --> 16:27.152
for a change, Herbert?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.906
Besides, if you do this,

16:30.989 --> 16:32.241
you'll be the heir
to the legacy key.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.243
Well, that's just
the greatest gift

16:34.326 --> 16:37.371
{\an1}anybody can give
to their freshman buddy.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.248
I don't know, Steve.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.250
{\an1}Where is your sense
of loyalty?

16:41.333 --> 16:42.251
Where's your sense
of adventure, man?

16:42.334 --> 16:45.921
{\an1}Come on, this is
the ultimate score

16:46.004 --> 16:48.298
for a computer hacker.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.759
{\an1}You are a hacker,
aren't you?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.302
(sighs)

16:52.386 --> 16:55.931
{\an6}Oh, hi. I'm calling from
the Computer Network
Maintenance Corporation.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.266
I spoke to someone

16:57.349 --> 16:58.726
{\an3}over at the Board
of Education,

16:58.809 --> 17:01.270
{\an3}and they said I should
check with the main office.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.146
{\an3}You see, we're running
a hardware-software

17:02.229 --> 17:05.148
{\an3}interface check on
your IBM ES 9000

17:05.232 --> 17:07.276
and, well, I need to
know your passwords

17:07.358 --> 17:10.612
{\an3}so we can verify
their security status.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.114
We're on hold.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.615
(exhales)
How'd I do?

17:13.699 --> 17:14.241
{\an1}Oh, you're a regular
techno-nerd.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.582
Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.048
Thank you.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.383
(sighs)

17:31.467 --> 17:32.968
We got 'em.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.345
Oh, piece of cake.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.309
(Steve laughing maniacally)

17:40.392 --> 17:42.060
{\an1}(whoops)

17:42.352 --> 17:46.648
{\an6}Hi.
Hi. I just heard
about Andrea.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.649
Is she gonna be okay?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.068
Oh, yeah, she'll be back
at school next week,

17:50.152 --> 17:52.029
but, uh, she won't be
walking around for a while.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.240
Good. Um, listen,
I-I know this is bad timing,

17:55.324 --> 17:56.325
but my aunt works
at William Morris,

17:56.408 --> 17:58.285
and she just gave me
four tickets

17:58.368 --> 18:02.164
to this live cable AIDS benefit
hosted by Rosie O'Donnell.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.208
Really?
Yeah. But it's tonight.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.169
So if you don't want to go,
I understand.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.670
{\an1}Well, now,
I don't think Andrea

18:08.754 --> 18:11.173
{\an1}would want us to miss out
on an opportunity like this.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.842
Great. Then it's
the four of us?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.010
Sure. Sounds great.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.053
{\an3}Thank you.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.347
{\an1}I better drive-- David
doesn't have his license yet.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.016
(clears throat):
Yes, I do.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.310
{\an1}(laughs)
My, my, my, young David,

18:23.393 --> 18:26.230
how time flies.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.609
(doorbell rings)

18:32.778 --> 18:34.238
{\an3}Oh, hi, Dylan.
Come on in.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.322
Brenda!

18:35.405 --> 18:36.365
Dylan's here!

18:36.448 --> 18:38.325
(French accent):
Rick, I must go. Um...

18:38.408 --> 18:41.245
Okay, I will see you tomorrow
at 1:00.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.081
Hey, Bren.

18:44.164 --> 18:44.915
{\an1}Is your Dad home?
I called his office,

18:44.998 --> 18:46.708
{\an1}and they said he
went home early today.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.210
{\an3}Yeah. He and my mom
are gonna go play golf.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.546
What's up?
Well,

18:50.629 --> 18:52.840
{\an1}my SAT scores came--
I got a little problem.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.217
{\an5}What's wrong,
didn't you do well?
No, I did too well.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.219
{\an5}They think I cheated--
the SAT people aren't
gonna allow my score.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.346
{\an4}What?
They say the only
reason I took it

18:59.429 --> 19:03.725
{\an4}at West Lompoc High was
so I could pay someone
to take it for me.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.061
But you were visiting
your father at Lompoc.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.271
Yeah. Tell it to the judge.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.522
JIM:
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,</i>

19:08.605 --> 19:12.943
{\an3}Dylan, I can understand why
the red flag was raised here.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.444
{\an3}Your scores went up
over 300 points.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.446
{\an1}You're kidding?
No, Bren.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.866
The last time I took the test,
I left early,

19:18.949 --> 19:19.741
because you were
in the hospital.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.202
{\an1}Well, can't we just
explain that to them?

19:22.286 --> 19:22.995
We can try.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.539
I'm sure there's
an appeal process.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.917
{\an3}JIM:
Of course,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.711
{\an3}there is another
alternative.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.421
It would mean
a lot less red tape.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.463
What is it?

19:33.547 --> 19:35.716
Take the test again.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.134
Absolutely not.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.928
{\an4}Dylan...
No way, Bren--
I did not cheat.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.388
I took the test myself.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.764
I'm sure you did,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.474
and I understand,
I know how you feel.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.935
{\an3}But sometimes
it's wise

19:47.019 --> 19:49.396
to identify the shortest route
between two places.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.565
Not this time.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.441
I did not cheat.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.611
They're not gonna
get away with it.

20:03.160 --> 20:03.952
I honestly didn't think

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
the balloons would fit
in the elevator.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.582
{\an3}You should have seen them in
the car driving down Wilshire.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.251
{\an6}ANDREA:
Oh, you guys are so
sweet-- Kelly came over,

20:11.335 --> 20:12.336
{\an3}Steve called, and Brenda
and Dylan are on their way.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.464
Can we sign your cast?
I brought markers for everyone.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.466
{\an3}Oh, absolutely.
Pick a leg, any leg.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.508
Cool.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.302
(chuckles):
But be careful.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.304
{\an4}BRANDON:
This isn't gonna
hurt, is it?

20:22.387 --> 20:25.182
I hope not.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.851
{\an5}Hey, you guys better
hurry, or you'll be
late for your show.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.645
Make sure you watch--
you know, you just might

20:29.728 --> 20:31.313
{\an1}see us there.
Oh.

20:31.396 --> 20:35.859
{\an5}ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Rosie O'Donnell!

20:37.444 --> 20:40.322
Thank you.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.531
It's great to be here.

20:41.615 --> 20:45.285
Unfortunately, we've only come
a few steps down the road

20:45.369 --> 20:46.495
in this battle against AIDS,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.830
but with the support
of people like you,

20:48.914 --> 20:52.542
a benefit like this won't be
necessary next year, hopefully.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.755
In these confusing times,

20:56.838 --> 20:58.882
there is one thing
that is certain--

20:58.966 --> 21:01.551
people are gonna continue
to have sex.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.428
Did you know that,
uh, 70% of all teenagers

21:03.512 --> 21:07.891
are sexually active by the time
they graduate high school?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.184
Lord knows I was.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.354
{\an5}(laughter)
That got me thinking back
to the first time that

21:12.437 --> 21:15.357
I did it, and I was thinking
about sharing that story

21:15.440 --> 21:17.567
with you guys,
and then I realized, you know,

21:17.651 --> 21:18.902
my parents are watching.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.904
(laughter)
So..

21:20.988 --> 21:22.406
I figure I couldn't do that.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.866
70%, though, that's a pretty...
pretty high number,

21:24.950 --> 21:27.160
and I figured
since I can't, you know,

21:27.244 --> 21:28.537
share with you,
I thought maybe you would want

21:28.620 --> 21:31.456
to share your first time
with me.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.208
What do you think? Yeah?

21:33.291 --> 21:34.418
(applause)

21:36.586 --> 21:39.089
{\an5}So, are you two in high school?
Yeah.
Yes.

21:39.172 --> 21:39.589
Yeah? Are you going out?

21:39.673 --> 21:42.009
Yeah.
Yes.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.719
Is this a long-term thing
or what?

21:43.802 --> 21:44.428
We just started dating...

21:44.511 --> 21:47.389
It's been a couple of months.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.515
{\an1}Really?
Yeah.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.600
So, are you doing it?

21:50.684 --> 21:53.228
(audience laughter, groans)

21:53.311 --> 21:55.272
ROSIE:
You don't remember?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.440
Come on,
you can share it with me.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.567
Just you,
me and 15 million people here.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.736
(laughter)

22:00.819 --> 22:02.738
So have you?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.948
Uh, uh, yeah, I have.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.241
And you?

22:06.324 --> 22:07.409
Yeah, I have.
You have.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.704
Just not with each other. Yet.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.539
{\an1}Right?
Call me Kreskin.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.249
{\an1}Go ahead,
talk to yourselves.

22:14.332 --> 22:14.833
How are you doing?

22:14.916 --> 22:16.918
{\an1}Good.
Good. Are you part

22:17.002 --> 22:18.253
of the 70%?

22:18.336 --> 22:19.588
No. I'm the other number.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
Really? And does
your boyfriend know

22:21.339 --> 22:22.591
you're still a virgin?

22:22.674 --> 22:25.260
Yeah. I know
all about it.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.970
ROSIE:
I'll bet you do.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.263
So you're gonna wait?

22:28.346 --> 22:31.099
Yeah. I guess I was
just brought up that way.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.185
Well, when you get home,
I want you to tell your mom

22:33.268 --> 22:34.936
that I think she did
a real good job raising you.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.563
{\an1}And don't let him
pressure you, either,

22:36.646 --> 22:37.647
'cause it's okay to wait.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.653
For all of you
who are having sex,

22:43.737 --> 22:48.116
please be careful
and every time use a condom.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.785
(applause)

22:49.868 --> 22:51.119
All right.

22:51.203 --> 22:51.620
(TV clicks off)

22:51.703 --> 22:53.955
You ready?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.957
{\an3}Yeah.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.001
{\an3}I'm sorry I'm taking you
home so early, babe.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.419
{\an3}I'm just--
I'm really beat.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.879
Oh, it's fine.

23:00.962 --> 23:01.671
{\an3}I still can't believe
those guys actually

23:01.755 --> 23:04.299
{\an3}got interviewed by
Rosie O'Donnell.

23:04.382 --> 23:04.966
{\an1}Yeah, I can't
believe they talked about

23:05.050 --> 23:07.469
their sex lives on national TV.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.596
Yeah, it is pretty weird.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.599
{\an3}Um, listen, Dylan,
I still can't

23:12.682 --> 23:14.309
{\an3}stop thinking about the deal
with those testing people.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.519
Bren, would you just
give it a rest, okay?

23:15.602 --> 23:18.146
I don't want to talk about it.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.607
I just don't know why you won't
consider taking the test again.

23:20.690 --> 23:21.817
Do you believe me?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.443
I mean, do you <i> believe</i> me, Bren?

23:23.527 --> 23:25.195
Of course I do.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.613
You've never lied to me, Dylan.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.324
{\an3}And I've always respected
and loved you for that.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.660
{\an3}In fact, when I got back
from France the reason why

23:31.743 --> 23:32.702
I told you that I met that guy

23:32.786 --> 23:35.831
was because you've always
been honest with me.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.708
Brenda, that's not
necessarily true.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.002
What?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.213
While you were gone this summer,

23:43.296 --> 23:45.006
there was a girl...

23:45.590 --> 23:48.301
I'm sorry.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.470
How could you?

23:50.554 --> 23:51.972
Wait a minute.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.516
Weren't we just talking about
your little French fling, Bren.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.684
I think you know

23:55.767 --> 23:58.645
exactly how things
like this happen.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.689
I told you about that
when it happened,

24:00.772 --> 24:02.482
you could've told me
about this, Dylan.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.359
It was being called a liar.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.862
I mean, it made me see
what a hypocrite I can be.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.321
I just couldn't live with it.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.865
Well, I'm glad you got

24:09.948 --> 24:11.241
your guilty conscience
all cleaned up.

24:11.324 --> 24:14.202
Brenda...

24:14.286 --> 24:15.704
I am sorry.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.666
Who was she, Dylan?

24:22.252 --> 24:23.712
{\an3}Was it that girl
Stacy again?

24:23.795 --> 24:26.173
No.
Then who?

24:26.256 --> 24:29.384
{\an1}"Who" is not
important, is it?

24:29.467 --> 24:31.386
I don't know, you tell me.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.471
No, it's not.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.808
{\an3}Forget about it,
spare me all the details.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.809
Just take me home, all right?

24:37.893 --> 24:41.688
Brenda, I... I needed
to tell you the truth.

24:41.771 --> 24:44.399
Well, you did.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.109
I am very impressed
with your integrity.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.944
Now take me home.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.126
DAVID:
<i>Donna, let me spend the night.</i>

25:03.210 --> 25:04.628
{\an1}How often are both
your parents out of town?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.671
No.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.924
{\an1}We don't have
to do anything.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.634
We can just sleep together.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.676
Yeah, right.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.221
I mean it.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.597
I love you.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.681
{\an1}Come on,
please let me stay?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.936
Only if you go to sleep.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.021
Go on, close your eyes.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.240
(bell tolling)

25:40.330 --> 25:42.332
(church organ music plays)

25:49.381 --> 25:50.799
You can't go in there.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.842
Why not?

25:52.926 --> 25:55.929
Because you're just
a little girl.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.826
I saved you a seat, Donna.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.911
Thank you.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.334
{\an3}FATHER CHRIS:
Just remember, children,

26:26.418 --> 26:28.878
{\an3}as you celebrate
your first communion,

26:28.962 --> 26:32.340
your lives ahead will be filled
with many difficult choices.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.342
But never forget,

26:34.426 --> 26:36.136
no matter what you do,

26:36.219 --> 26:38.179
God will always love you.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.515
Even me, Father Chris?

26:40.598 --> 26:42.684
Yes, Donna, even you.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.978
Even if I sleep with my
boyfriend before I get married?

26:45.061 --> 26:45.854
(girls giggling)

26:45.937 --> 26:47.856
{\an3}Yes, Donna.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.692
No matter what,
God will always love you.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.654
But your mother and father
will be very disappointed.

26:54.738 --> 26:55.739
(echoing):
Very disappointed.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.038
David, you have to go home.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.292
What?

27:10.462 --> 27:10.795
BRENDA:
<i>Okay, Mom,</i>

27:10.879 --> 27:12.756
how do I look?

27:12.839 --> 27:15.008
Terrific, but what's
all the fuss about?

27:15.091 --> 27:17.010
{\an1}(doorbell chimes)
That's Rick.

27:17.093 --> 27:17.886
Oh, I can't wait.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.556
Oh, Mom... just play along.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.516
{\an3}Okay?
Honey, I don't know.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.893
I mean, what if Dylan finds out?

27:24.976 --> 27:26.603
It'll do him some good.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.854
What?

27:27.937 --> 27:29.606
Look, Mom, after today,

27:29.689 --> 27:31.274
{\an1}I'm never gonna
see Rick again, okay?

27:31.358 --> 27:32.734
So just, please?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.402
(doorbell chimes)

27:34.486 --> 27:36.321
{\an3}Shouldn't you be saying,
<i>s'il vous plai?</i>

27:42.786 --> 27:44.245
<i>Bonjour.</i>

27:44.329 --> 27:48.208
{\an3}You look every bit as
beautiful as I remember you.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.418
{\an1}(French accent):
You just saw me two days ago.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.712
The longest two
days of my life.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.757
{\an1}<i>Merci.</i> Now where are
you taking me?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.550
Don't I get to meet
your family first?

27:57.634 --> 27:59.761
Oh, they are not home...

27:59.844 --> 28:00.929
So, this is the famous Rick?

28:03.681 --> 28:06.768
Aunt Cindy, I did not
realize you were home.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.144
{\an5}It's a pleasure to
meet you ma'am.
And you.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.897
Your niece has told me
an awful lot about you.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.274
Oh, she has?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.692
I promise to have her

28:14.776 --> 28:15.610
home in time for dinner.

28:15.693 --> 28:16.945
I know you'll probably
want to get

28:17.028 --> 28:18.655
a good night's sleep
before your flight tomorrow.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.657
Oh,<i> oui.</i>

28:20.740 --> 28:22.450
So... where are you off to?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.952
(music playing)

28:24.035 --> 28:25.912
Uh...
(entrance bell chimes)

28:25.995 --> 28:29.124
I am not so hungry, Rick.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.834
{\an3}Perhaps we can come
back some other time.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.001
Brenda, wait, all the guys

28:32.085 --> 28:34.879
{\an1}in my fraternity
swear by this place.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.506
They got this thing
called a Megaburger

28:36.589 --> 28:37.632
{\an1}that's supposed
to be incredible.

28:37.715 --> 28:38.216
I don't think so.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.761
Oh, come on, I'm starving.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.264
{\an1}Oh, there is a table
in the corner.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.432
{\an3}A table?
No, forget it.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.350
{\an3}In America, you have
to sit at the counter.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.935
Of course.

28:51.729 --> 28:52.397
Excuse me, waiter.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.940
BRANDON:
Yeah, one minute, buddy.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.025
Here you go, Willy.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.318
Oh, hey, Bren.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.945
You know this guy?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.657
Uh,<i> oui.</i>

29:02.740 --> 29:03.825
This is my cousin.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.661
Yeah, that's right,

29:06.744 --> 29:08.705
I'm Aunt Cindy
and Uncle Jim's son.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.833
<i>Oui.</i> Brandon, this is Rick.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.668
How ya doin', Rick?

29:13.751 --> 29:16.880
Good. Why didn't
you say anything?

29:16.963 --> 29:19.507
I mean, you acted like

29:19.591 --> 29:20.633
you didn't even know
where this place was.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.802
{\an3}She didn't tell me
you worked here.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.637
Yeah, it's a family thing.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.097
{\an3}Hi, Bren. Who's
your friend?

29:26.181 --> 29:28.016
Ah, bonjour,
Monsieur Nat.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.767
This is Rick.

29:32.729 --> 29:33.480
{\an3}(mocking accent):
Hi, Rick.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.816
BRANDON:
Nat, you remember my cousin,

29:36.900 --> 29:39.903
{\an5}Brenda, from France,
Eiffel Tower...
France, oh, yeah...

29:39.986 --> 29:41.029
France, sure, oh, yeah.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.239
(normal voice):
You know what,

29:43.323 --> 29:44.324
I cannot take this anymore.

29:44.407 --> 29:47.869
{\an3}Look, I am not Brenda Dubois
and I am not from Paris.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.329
My name is Brenda Walsh.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.038
{\an3}I was born in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.039
I go to West Beverly High School

29:51.122 --> 29:53.666
{\an3}and I'm just as
American as you are,

29:53.750 --> 29:54.792
so I'm sorry.

29:58.796 --> 30:01.674
{\an1}My sister's always had
a flare for drama.

30:01.758 --> 30:02.717
Your sister?

30:02.800 --> 30:04.761
Twin sister.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.597
Excuse me, would ya?

30:10.141 --> 30:13.770
{\an1}Look, um, Rick,
I'm sorry.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.563
{\an1}I can't believe it got
so out of hand.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.023
{\an1}I really wanted
to tell you the truth,

30:17.106 --> 30:18.691
{\an1}but I thought
that you would hate me.

30:18.775 --> 30:22.237
♪ I said,
"Baby, don't you see? ♪

30:22.320 --> 30:25.615
♪ "We fit so perfectly" ♪

30:25.698 --> 30:29.536
♪ You said we'd be together
for all time ♪

30:29.619 --> 30:32.747
{\an1}Does this mean
you don't hate me?

30:32.830 --> 30:36.918
Look, I liked Brenda DuBois,

30:37.001 --> 30:40.255
but I could fall in love
with Brenda Walsh.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.590
♪ I'll do anything
to keep you mine. ♪

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
(bell tolling)

31:04.195 --> 31:05.655
Donna!

31:05.738 --> 31:06.406
Hi, Father Chris.

31:06.489 --> 31:09.617
{\an1}Am I catching you
at a bad time?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.785
No, not at all.

31:10.868 --> 31:11.703
Here, sit down.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.670
It's good to see
you here again.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.796
{\an1}You know,
I can remember

31:21.879 --> 31:23.965
{\an1}when you took
your first communion.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.134
{\an3}Yeah, it's good
to be back.

31:26.217 --> 31:30.513
{\an4}You must really
be struggling
with something.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.515
How'd you know?

31:32.599 --> 31:37.770
You're here, aren't you?

31:37.854 --> 31:40.064
{\an3}You know that boy
that I introduced you to

31:40.148 --> 31:41.691
{\an3}at the video store
the other day?

31:41.774 --> 31:43.484
Uh-huh, David, right?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.278
{\an3}Yeah.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.655
Well, he's very special.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.949
And we've been going
out for a while now,

31:50.033 --> 31:50.491
like, a year.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.160
And I really like him.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.997
{\an1}He seems like
a very nice young man.

31:56.080 --> 31:56.873
{\an3}He is.

31:56.956 --> 32:04.005
And I'm really,
really attracted to him,

32:04.088 --> 32:05.006
you know?

32:05.089 --> 32:06.299
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

32:06.382 --> 32:09.010
And I, I just don't know
what to do about,

32:09.093 --> 32:13.222
you know... sex.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.141
{\an1}What does your heart
tell you to do?

32:15.224 --> 32:18.186
Well, it's not my heart
that I'm worried about.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.689
(both chuckle)

32:21.773 --> 32:22.649
The love you choose

32:22.732 --> 32:25.360
{\an1}to give to another
is your most precious gift.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.487
That includes your sexuality.

32:27.570 --> 32:31.532
{\an1}Your virginity
is a gift, Donna.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.950
So you've got to ask yourself

32:33.034 --> 32:35.036
{\an1}if David's the one
you want to give it to.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.664
I love him
and he loves me.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.040
I do know that.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.541
Well, that's wonderful.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.543
{\an1}That just makes this decision
that much harder for you,

32:42.627 --> 32:43.586
doesn't it?

32:43.670 --> 32:46.214
{\an1}In that case,
why don't you pray on it

32:46.297 --> 32:47.215
for a while?

32:47.298 --> 32:49.425
And just remember...

32:49.509 --> 32:52.470
no matter what you do,
God will always love you.

32:55.556 --> 33:00.728
You said the same thing to me
when I was a little girl.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.063
{\an1}They're words
to live by.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.069
{\an3}You know, it's
a lot easier

33:08.152 --> 33:10.113
{\an3}talking to you without
that stupid accent.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.072
{\an1}Brenda...

33:11.155 --> 33:13.574
(with French accent)
I loved zat accent.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.701
I really did.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.744
(both chuckle)

33:16.828 --> 33:19.080
{\an1}(normal voice):
Can, can I see you again?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.998
Can I see you tomorrow?

33:21.082 --> 33:22.583
I don't know.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.085
Brenda, please...

33:24.168 --> 33:27.255
finding you again
was like a gift.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.757
Don't take it away.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.634
{\an3}Look, I have a
boyfriend, Rick.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.094
{\an1}You told me that
in Paris.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.346
It didn't stop you then.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.557
I was a thousand miles away
from home.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.933
I was pretending
to be somebody else.

33:39.016 --> 33:39.851
I can't pretend anymore.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.270
{\an1}Then don't pretend
that there isn't something

33:42.353 --> 33:43.604
powerful between us.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.190
{\an1}I don't want
to lose you, Brenda.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.401
Not a second time.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.783
I have to go.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.243
You're seeing him
again, aren't you?

33:57.326 --> 33:58.703
You're seeing him tonight.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.663
Yes.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.626
{\an1}Brenda, I wasn't kidding
when I said this was kismet.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.587
Think about it.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.795
What are the odds of two people

34:08.880 --> 34:10.882
finding each other again
like we did?

34:12.007 --> 34:15.011
{\an1}So if you're gonna try
and buck odds like that,

34:15.094 --> 34:17.638
{\an1}just make sure this
other guy is worth it.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.815
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>You talked to a priest</i>
<i>about us?</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:30.693
{\an1}That's what
they're there for.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.154
{\an3}First Rosie O'Donnell,
now a priest.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.447
{\an3}The whole world knows
about our sex life.

34:34.530 --> 34:38.993
Listen, David, I've been
thinking a lot about it.

34:39.076 --> 34:40.203
And?

34:40.286 --> 34:42.955
And I think we should wait
till we're out of high school.

34:43.039 --> 34:43.623
{\an1}And then,
if we're still together,

34:43.706 --> 34:45.373
we can talk about it again.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.335
So that's it?

34:47.418 --> 34:50.713
You made up your mind?

34:50.797 --> 34:54.007
{\an1}If you can't accept it,
I won't be happy.

34:54.091 --> 34:56.010
In fact, I'll be miserable.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.179
But I'll understand.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.722
Look, Donna,
I'm not going anywhere.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.974
Not only do I love you,
I like you a lot.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.851
{\an3}I like everything
about you.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.813
Well, then, you can stand it
if we just do a lot of kissing

35:06.896 --> 35:08.022
and messing around

35:08.105 --> 35:09.816
{\an1}and we don't
go all the way?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.025
Well, what would
Father Chris say?

35:11.108 --> 35:12.443
Father Chris doesn't
make the rules.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.737
Then who does?

35:14.821 --> 35:16.364
We do.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.033
{\an1}So, uh...

35:19.116 --> 35:21.035
think you can handle it?

35:22.995 --> 35:24.247
If you can, I can.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.457
{\an1}Oh, I can.

35:46.811 --> 35:47.979
Hey.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.981
Hey.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.567
{\an5}Glad to see
you're sitting up.
(chuckles)

35:52.650 --> 35:53.734
How're you doing?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.570
{\an1}Depressed, uncomfortable,
helpless.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.530
Aside from that, just peachy.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.031
Well, you look
a lot better.

35:59.115 --> 35:59.740
{\an1}Thank you.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.659
The police were
just here again.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.244
They having any luck?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.078
{\an1}No.

36:04.161 --> 36:06.205
{\an1}And the longer they go
without a suspect,

36:06.289 --> 36:08.374
the worse their chances
are of catching anyone.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.084
That must be pretty tough.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.086
{\an1}Yeah, it's the worst part
about this whole thing.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.880
Without a license plate number,

36:13.963 --> 36:17.758
all I can tell them is that
it was a big, silver, loud car.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.802
Not much of an I.D., huh?

36:20.344 --> 36:23.931
Check out my new wheels.

36:24.015 --> 36:27.935
A wheelchair?
Yep.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.937
They couldn't, uh, get you
any crutches or anything?

36:30.021 --> 36:33.149
Nope, doctor's orders.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.443
{\an1}I gotta stay off my legs
for a whole month.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.777
{\an3}Well it shouldn't
be too bad.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.112
You've got a
lot of friends.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.572
Don't worry. We'll
take care of you.

36:39.655 --> 36:43.409
{\an1}Yeah, you know how great
I am asking for help.

36:43.492 --> 36:46.120
Well, it looks like you don't
have much choice now, do you?

36:47.538 --> 36:50.791
{\an5}BRENDA:
<i>How much longer is</i>
<i>this going to take?</i>

36:50.875 --> 36:54.462
I don't know, Bren, the whole
damn thing is just ridiculous.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.840
{\an1}Look, instead of
drafting angry letters

36:57.924 --> 36:58.674
to the testing service,

36:58.758 --> 37:00.968
why don't you just
take the test over?

37:01.052 --> 37:01.928
{\an3}Hey, have we been
through this?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.763
When are you gonna
quit harping on me?

37:03.846 --> 37:06.098
I'm not harping on anything.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.351
I don't understand why
everything is a battle with you.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.311
{\an1}What have you got
to be so angry about?

37:10.394 --> 37:11.646
{\an3}Hey, let's see what
you would do

37:11.729 --> 37:13.147
{\an3}if you were falsely
accused of something, okay?

37:13.230 --> 37:14.649
I know one thing.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.692
I'd be a hell of a lot more
realistic than you're being.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.819
{\an3}Brenda, if you're not going to
get behind me on this thing,

37:18.903 --> 37:19.862
{\an3}why don't you just
leave me alone?

37:19.946 --> 37:21.989
Fine.
I will leave you alone.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.866
Good.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.451
Because this isn't
about the S.A.T., Dylan.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.872
And we should stop
pretending that it is.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.999
What does that mean?

37:33.876 --> 37:36.963
Dylan, do you realize
that we've both told each other

37:37.046 --> 37:38.381
that our little flings
don't mean anything?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
Well, they do mean something.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.469
And it's about time

37:43.552 --> 37:46.013
{\an3}we both faced up to that.
I know, Bren.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.515
That's why I told you about
what happened this summer.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.684
Oh, come off it.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.435
You told me because
you felt guilty.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.561
Well, so do I.

37:53.938 --> 37:58.234
Look, the guy I met in Paris
showed up in LA this week

37:58.317 --> 38:00.903
{\an1}and I went out with him
this afternoon.

38:00.987 --> 38:05.408
Dylan, I love you, but we need
a rest, for both of our sakes.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.701
Are you sure, Bren?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.160
Are you sure about
what you're saying?

38:08.244 --> 38:09.996
You'd better mean it,
because I'm not gonna try

38:10.079 --> 38:11.205
and stop you this time.

38:11.288 --> 38:12.456
Dylan, will you sit down?

38:18.587 --> 38:21.173
I'm not sure about anything.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.552
{\an1}But we can't go
on like this.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.636
So where do we go from here?

38:28.472 --> 38:30.057
Wherever we want, I guess.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.517
You mean that?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.519
Yeah, I do.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.190
So this is it, then.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.359
Dylan, don't hate me.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.486
I could never hate you, Bren.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.750
You better go.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.309
I better go.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.221
(chuckles)

39:58.729 --> 39:59.605
Yes.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.120
Okay, we're in.
The password works.

40:14.203 --> 40:14.829
Great.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.667
Here it is, grade bank files.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.627
Last name first.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.670
{\an1}Sanders.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.047
S-A-N-D-E-R-S.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.674
First name, middle initial.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.842
Steven.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.510
S-T-E-V-E-N.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.053
Middle initial M.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.016
Here it is.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.269
Wow.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.524
These are the worst grades
I've ever seen.

40:43.607 --> 40:47.570
{\an3}You got a D in
ninth grade math?

40:47.653 --> 40:48.863
That's addition and subtraction.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.198
And too much long division.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.993
What do you want instead?

40:54.076 --> 40:55.452
B.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.038
Done.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.707
{\an3}Ah, I see we failed
freshman social studies.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.667
Not for long.

41:01.750 --> 41:02.751
C okay?

41:02.835 --> 41:03.627
B.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.758
(keyboard key clattering)

41:09.842 --> 41:10.885
What's wrong?

41:10.968 --> 41:12.052
Just shut up, all right?

41:14.346 --> 41:16.182
I'm locked out.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.558
What do you mean?

41:17.641 --> 41:19.685
I don't know.
The system could be crashing.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.520
{\an3}There could be an alarm
on the password.

41:21.604 --> 41:22.688
Well, what do we do?

41:22.771 --> 41:23.898
Just hold on a second.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.525
Let me try something first.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.613
What's going on here, man.

41:30.696 --> 41:31.906
I don't know.

41:31.989 --> 41:32.823
But we better get
the hell out of here.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.252
What are you doing now?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.545
{\an3}"Sponging."

41:46.629 --> 41:47.880
I learned it from a video.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.174
What do you think?
The green or the blue?

41:50.799 --> 41:54.386
Blue.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.804
Blue?
Mm-hmm.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.765
{\an3}I don't know if I can
live with blue.

41:57.848 --> 41:58.766
Well, the green's nice.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.768
Is it too nice?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.853
{\an1}Kelly, what is going
on with you?

42:02.937 --> 42:05.648
Are you planning to spend a lot
of time in your room this year?

42:05.731 --> 42:07.733
That doesn't sound like you.

42:07.816 --> 42:08.651
I don't know, Mom.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.277
{\an3}I'm just going through
some changes.

42:10.361 --> 42:13.739
{\an1}Well, honey, there's change
and then there's change.

42:13.822 --> 42:16.659
{\an3}You're right, the
green's not that bad.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.994
(phone ringing)

42:20.829 --> 42:21.830
Hello.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.624
Oh, hi, Bren.
What's up?

42:23.707 --> 42:25.960
Dylan and I broke up.

42:26.043 --> 42:29.755
{\an3}Hang on. Mom...
can we talk tomorrow?

42:29.838 --> 42:30.839
Sure, honey.

42:32.925 --> 42:33.801
Brenda, what happened.

42:33.884 --> 42:34.802
I don't know.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.637
Things just came to a head,
I guess.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.681
Dylan finally told me he went
out with someone this summer.

42:38.764 --> 42:39.723
He did?

42:39.807 --> 42:40.683
Well, I always knew

42:40.766 --> 42:42.810
there was something going on.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.270
It was written
all over his face.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.646
Who was it?

42:45.729 --> 42:46.689
I don't know,
and I don't care.

42:46.772 --> 42:49.149
Look, we were both fooling
around, anyway.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.651
There must have been a reason.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.820
I thought you guys would be
together forever.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.114
Yeah, me, too.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.241
I hope I did the right thing.

42:57.324 --> 42:58.826
Brenda, are you sure
you're not doing this

42:58.909 --> 43:00.202
just because, you know,

43:00.286 --> 43:03.455
Rick's waiting in the wings?
Of course not.

43:03.539 --> 43:04.873
Look, if Dylan
and I stay together,

43:04.957 --> 43:06.667
we'll continue to drive
each other crazy,

43:06.750 --> 43:07.167
and hurt each other.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.836
I don't want that.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.839
I hope things
work out for you.

43:11.922 --> 43:12.923
It's just so weird

43:13.007 --> 43:16.844
thinking of you and Dylan
apart, you know.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.345
I don't really know what to say.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.347
(knocking)

43:20.431 --> 43:22.850
I'm on the phone, David!

43:24.768 --> 43:27.021
I didn't mean to scare you.

43:27.104 --> 43:29.481
Brenda, I've got to go.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.107
What's the matter?

43:30.190 --> 43:32.901
Uh, David just walked in.

43:32.985 --> 43:34.028
I can't talk.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.863
All right, well, call me back.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.449
Bye.

43:41.952 --> 43:42.828
How'd you get in?

43:42.911 --> 43:43.704
I didn't hear the doorbell.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.748
I knocked.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.249
I didn't want to wake the baby.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.334
{\an1}So, your mom
let me in.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.585
Oh.

43:50.794 --> 43:51.879
What are you doing here?

43:51.962 --> 43:55.382
Helping you paint?

43:55.466 --> 43:57.593
Yeah, right.

43:57.676 --> 43:58.719
Try again.

43:58.802 --> 44:03.015
{\an1}Well, Brenda thinks
that, uh, we should start

44:03.098 --> 44:05.225
seeing other people.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.269
So she said.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.687
What do you think?

44:08.771 --> 44:11.273
{\an1}I think it's time
I started seeing you.
