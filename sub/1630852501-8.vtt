WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.010 --> 00:12.512
JANA HAS LEFT THE GROUP

00:14.806 --> 00:15.640
No way.

00:16.474 --> 00:19.019
Is dropping out a new trend now?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.771
-Esteban?
-Right.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.149
-First Esteban, now Jana.
-No, it's Esteban.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.359
Where's Luka?

00:35.910 --> 00:38.121
That was great, for a county fair.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.039
It sucks.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.791
Just watch and learn.
If you don't like it, leave.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.211
I'm just saying,
while Xuxa ruins the chorus,

00:45.295 --> 00:48.423
you're being knockoff Luis Miguel
with worse vocals.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.217
It's a shame
you're wasting someone like me.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.179
I'm talented, I sing well. Honestly.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.513
I know you're talented.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.308
I don't need you now. Back to your corner.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.562
Luka!

01:04.731 --> 01:05.857
Hey, no.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.275
No morons here.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.610
What's wrong?

01:10.195 --> 01:14.074
You're coming with me
to tell Celina about the video.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.326
-What about the video?
-He blackmailed me.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.660
They sabotaged us.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.912
I didn't do anything.

01:18.995 --> 01:19.996
Don't play dumb.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.582
We had a deal. I did my part.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.335
Why didn't you tell me everything?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.003
What do you want?

01:27.087 --> 01:30.298
If you knew you were my brother,
you should've told me from the start.

01:32.717 --> 01:33.593
What?

01:33.676 --> 01:35.178
Marcelo's my dad, dude.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.763
Brothers?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.474
You didn't know?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.060
Don't mess with me.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.908
Being Marcelo's son
doesn't make you a Colucci.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.912
You're a knockoff.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.252
You're a poor kid.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
That's why your mom left.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
Go ahead, hit me.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.193
Luka, are you okay?

02:52.755 --> 02:54.132
This is the real video.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.635
Kick me out if you want,
but the band is innocent.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.597
Is it fair to pay for something
you were forced into?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.599
Esteban, tell me the truth.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.142
Just give them a chance.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.534
Hey.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.703
Relax.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.003
It's taking a long time.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.463
Yeah.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.888
I'll be right back.

03:45.058 --> 03:45.934
What did I say?

03:46.643 --> 03:47.769
Everyone's leaving.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.177
-We're going home.
-No. Why?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.930
You're not spending
another minute here, María José.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.974
Just look how you're dressed.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.020
-Why?
-You know why. You lied to us.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.649
-We know everything.
-What are you talking about?

04:34.732 --> 04:35.900
Oh please.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.611
Teresa from church sent this to us.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.447
Someone recognized you and told her.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.035
You're drunk and singing blasphemy.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.247
This isn't the daughter we raised.
We're leaving now.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.708
-Let's go.
-I'm not the daughter you raised.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.668
I'm happier, okay?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.963
I lied that this was
a religious music school.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.048
But that was the only way.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.884
Plus, doesn't the Bible say we should use

05:02.635 --> 05:04.262
the talents God gave us?

05:04.345 --> 05:05.179
Oh please.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.933
That's what church choir is for. Okay?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.019
I'm more than a choir singer, Dad.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.104
Much more.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.816
I'm singing at the final tomorrow.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.234
On a huge stage.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.278
Come see me.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.697
Please.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.907
If you don't like it,

05:24.991 --> 05:28.202
take me out of school, no questions asked.
Just give me a chance.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.423
Are you okay?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.593
We have to be in the final.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.931
It's the only option.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.226
What did they say?

05:55.938 --> 05:56.939
What happened?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.609
We're still disqualified.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.821
I tried talking to Celina,
but the board is adamant.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.156
She can't help us.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.159
We submitted the video late.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.286
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.872
No, dude. It's not your fault.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.749
This is on Luka.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.376
He manipulated all of us.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.462
Yeah, but I could've refused.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.467
MJ, I'm sorry.

06:27.136 --> 06:31.015
No, it's okay.
We can always try next year.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.310
I won't have a next year!

06:36.020 --> 06:38.398
My parents want to pull me out of school.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.235
I convinced them
to give me until the final.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.738
I was sure I'd convince them
when they heard me sing, but…

07:08.970 --> 07:11.431
-Thanks, Jana, you have 30 minutes to eat.
-Sure.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.473
Okay.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.517
Thank you.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.653
You look beautiful, hon.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.658
You have to learn
to put things in perspective.

07:30.741 --> 07:35.079
At the end of the day,
that school had you… trapped.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.080
It wasn't for you.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.166
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

07:38.749 --> 07:39.584
Thanks.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.756
Careful with your figure.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.343
Here.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.598
Jana.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.475
Can you come here for a moment?

08:32.803 --> 08:35.723
Are you done, Luka? You were off pitch.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.267
We need to finish high.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.061
-I like it.
-Thanks.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.020
Well, I hate it.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.314
You didn't play well either, don't start.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.858
Hey, you're not doing us any favors.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.069
Remember you're here because of me, Luka.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.865
If you want to play with your friends,
go ahead. I'm sure they'd love your opera.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.701
If we don't win, book your ticket home.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.208
THE NONAMES ARE DISQUALIFIED

09:06.087 --> 09:07.964
Hell yeah. The Nonames are out.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.569
What's wrong?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.488
It's not fair to them.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.371
Why are you defending them?

09:42.039 --> 09:45.668
Are you so afraid of them
that you can't win fairly?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.336
You don't know anything.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.465
What did you do, Luka?

09:52.633 --> 09:54.093
Sabotage the video?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.637
The nice act isn't for you.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.266
I've practiced enough.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.242
Can you give me a minute?

10:47.396 --> 10:49.607
JANA! ANSWER ME. WE NEED YOUR HELP.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.318
JANA? WHERE ARE YOU? WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.155
Janita, you're on in five.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.408
Jana, what's wrong?

11:00.117 --> 11:01.369
Is it about your friends?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.038
Why are you so upset, Janita?

11:04.538 --> 11:07.249
This is a step in the right direction.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.795
Jana Cohen's return to the stage.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.297
This is what's best for you.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.466
Everything happens for a reason.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.219
After all, that school wasn't…

11:32.858 --> 11:34.318
I heard what happened.

11:36.070 --> 11:39.448
I never wanted this to happen.
I wanted to see you in the final.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.033
And you will,

11:41.117 --> 11:43.119
in the audience.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.454
What do you want me to do?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.959
I don't know. Walking out on Sebas

11:50.042 --> 11:52.169
would be a good start.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.592
But didn't you feel so bad?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.679
Your priorities are clear, Emilia.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.390
Congratulations, I guess.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.017
You'll win singing backup for that idiot.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.896
Winning is the first step
to a record deal.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.482
It means staying in Mexico with you.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.277
If you want to stay with me so badly,

12:16.902 --> 12:19.071
why do you keep acting like we're nothing?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.949
Please, Andi. Don't do this to me now.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.578
You think I'll wait while everyone thinks
you're banging that guy?

12:25.661 --> 12:26.537
Nah.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.164
Give me a chance, please.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.833
I've given you plenty.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.712
Now it's clear what really matters to you.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.338
I hope you win.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.509
Oh, and Emilia, please,

12:41.135 --> 12:42.136
don't contact me again.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.471
No, Andi!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.388
Andi!

12:52.229 --> 12:53.981
You don't have to do anything.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.069
You don't have to save me or anything.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.946
I'm not doing this for you.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.285
The world deserves to feel what I do

13:06.368 --> 13:09.121
when I hear you sing. That's why.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.626
I know you were born to be on stage.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.752
Singing.

13:15.294 --> 13:19.340
Showing everyone how talented,
beautiful, and incredible you are.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.385
Seriously.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.390
You're one of a kind.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.426
We'll be in the final.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.262
You'll see.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.683
We need to talk to Jana,
she'll have an idea to…

14:10.766 --> 14:12.017
You too, Dixon?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.604
Jana's gone. She doesn't give a shit.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.816
Everyone follows her
like she's Wonder Woman.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.110
How can we trust someone who left us?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.445
I'm tired.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.989
MJ…

14:25.072 --> 14:26.532
I'm sorry. I just…

14:47.511 --> 14:48.345
Can I?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.144
I wanted to apologize.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.816
You shouldn't have to deal
with the final fiasco.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.318
Like you care.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.696
I do. I like you.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.907
You're very talented.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.702
I mean it.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.997
I'm not just saying it,
I saw at the party.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.542
Where you left me
unconscious in the Jacuzzi?

15:22.379 --> 15:25.674
I was too drunk to realize
how drunk you were. I'm sorry.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.052
If I didn't leave, I would've freaked out.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.431
You must think I'm a villain.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.102
I'm sure Jana says so all the time.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.481
My problem is with her, not you.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.068
Really, I like you.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
I think Jana is jealous of you.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.325
Very much.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.162
You're more than a backup singer.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.569
You didn't have to do that.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.780
You're back.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.243
What did you gain by destroying us?

16:35.035 --> 16:37.121
Dude, you could've won on your own.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.790
You have more talent than all of EWS

16:39.873 --> 16:41.000
and you know it.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.962
You want me to be the villain here?

16:45.045 --> 16:47.756
Should I monologue
about all my reasons why?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.218
You don't have to be
what others want you to be.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.887
I'm not who I thought I was.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.265
And I'm definitely not who others thought.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.976
You don't have to be either.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.687
What do you mean by that?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.647
You said it yourself.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.233
You took on the role of the villain.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.068
And you're not.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.571
As hard as you might try.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.618
Being a Colucci
doesn't mean you need to act like one.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.750
I need your help.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.716
MJ, why don't you do that tomorrow?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.092
What does it matter?

17:35.262 --> 17:37.347
No way. Jana!

17:38.015 --> 17:39.850
I'm so glad you're back.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.978
There's something we need to do.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.606
We're ending The Lodge.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.274
Another plan?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.485
Give it a rest.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.237
What's up? Where are you going?

17:52.321 --> 17:55.908
She told her parents
she'd sing in the final

17:55.991 --> 17:58.160
so they'd let her stay.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.162
Since she's not…

18:04.458 --> 18:06.710
MJ, I promise we'll be in the final.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.587
Give me a chance to fix this.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.214
You won't regret it.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.602
You look like you've seen a ghost.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
I didn't think you'd come back.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.108
You're back.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.776
-You too.
-Yeah.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.865
What is this moron doing here?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.368
Luka's helping us get into the final.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.577
Helping us?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.121
Please, Jana.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.541
The only thing this guy's done
is stab us in the back.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.960
I'm your only option to play in the final.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.169
I don't buy it either.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.462
I made a mistake.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.631
People make mistakes.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.551
I'm asking for forgiveness.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.471
I'm sorry, really.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.892
Plus, I want to show my dad he's wrong.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.270
Their dad.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.563
What do you mean?

19:09.648 --> 19:10.649
Marcelo's my father.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.736
A lot's happened since you left.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.953
-Hi.
-<i>What do you want?</i>

19:23.036 --> 19:25.080
You could at least say hi.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.042
The Nonames know everything
about The Lodge.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.421
They're planning to tell all at the final.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.380
What?

19:33.881 --> 19:38.135
Yeah. When XY goes on stage,
they're going to play the "Save Me" video.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.514
And then a video
of you and MJ at Jana's party.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.058
Wanna know the last part?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.604
They have proof you're screwing Anita.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.564
That's impossible, Luka.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.275
It's not.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.361
They think I'm on their side.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.697
Why do they think that?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.282
What do you mean?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.035
I'm the best actor at this school.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.078
Get The Lodge together.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.881
-What does the band know?
-A lot.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.552
They know The Lodge
is a knockoff American frat.

20:20.636 --> 20:24.890
They don't know why it's so important
for Sebas to win the competition.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.603
If you want to be successful at EWS,
the only way is to team up with us.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.190
If you have the right last name,
you're admitted.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.525
In exchange,
The Lodge paves your way to win.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.737
That's why The Nonames became a problem

20:38.820 --> 20:40.155
and I had so much trouble.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.741
What trouble, Luka?
This helps us both win.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.619
I get that. I don't understand you, Anita.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.579
What?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.958
You said to get in,
you need to have the right last name,

20:51.458 --> 20:54.044
come from a wealthy family,
but you're a secretary.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.216
I'm the coordinator of this chapter
of The Lodge. Every school has--

20:59.299 --> 21:01.051
So you're still a secretary.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.805
Can you believe they just found out?

21:05.555 --> 21:08.100
-What?
-Look what we have here.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.142
We got you!

21:09.685 --> 21:11.770
Come on. Quick!

21:11.853 --> 21:12.688
They're filming.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.815
Careful, Limantour!

21:14.898 --> 21:16.191
Look at them.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.985
Hey, Sebas.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.153
<i>We got you.</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:23.949
Sebas and The Lodge
have plotted against us from the start.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.786
They also made Luka sabotage our video.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.998
I can't find Mr. Langarica.

21:31.081 --> 21:31.999
Obviously.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.084
He just shat himself and ran away.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.586
-Watch your language.
-Thank you, Lourdes.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.006
This is a lot. I need to process this.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.093
Really, I can't believe Anita.
I feel so stupid.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.262
Don't blame yourself, Principal Ferrer.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.807
Bad people take advantage
of those with good intentions.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.144
I'll talk to the board immediately.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.605
I promise we won't let this go,
there will be consequences.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.695
Wow, I can't believe you're a Colucci.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.779
I know.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.364
What a trip.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.577
I thought the craziest thing that happened

22:09.077 --> 22:10.787
was finding out Dixon's rich.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.955
What, dude?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.126
Well, not really. I mean,

22:17.252 --> 22:18.545
my family lives

22:19.296 --> 22:20.380
comfortably.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.593
No way, only rich people say that. God.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.677
Yeah, dude.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.890
Cheer up.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.060
It's over, we beat The Lodge.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.896
We can play in the final.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.522
If it even happens.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.523
It will.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.650
What do you mean?

22:40.734 --> 22:42.361
Obviously, it's happening.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.904
And we're playing.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.989
Yeah, relax.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.451
We could even win.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.661
-Can we talk?
-Yeah.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.580
We're going to kill it.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.748
You're going to shine.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.416
Like you always do.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.085
Okay?

23:01.004 --> 23:02.881
Where did they go?

23:03.673 --> 23:05.300
They're so predictable.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.929
-They're getting back together.
-Of course they are.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.808
They'll come back sweaty,
with messy hair, and smiles

23:12.891 --> 23:14.434
like this.

23:15.727 --> 23:19.147
When you said it was a hard time
in your life, I didn't imagine this.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.482
Yeah.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.442
I thought finding my mom

23:22.526 --> 23:24.820
would give meaning to my life.
But it didn't.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.824
What gives my life meaning is you.

23:36.081 --> 23:36.998
What's wrong?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.336
Is everything okay?

23:45.507 --> 23:46.591
I can't.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.560
After you found your mom,
I thought you'd realize

23:57.060 --> 23:59.855
you don't need anyone
to give your life meaning.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.401
You want me to be that for you.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.738
It's not fair to either of us.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.994
You don't have to do things for me,
or your mom,

24:15.162 --> 24:16.163
or anyone.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.165
Do it for you.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.795
I barely have a grip on my own life.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.681
Esteban.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.602
I don't think we should stay together.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.774
Jana, I fucked up. Okay? I'm sorry.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.984
Let's take it slow.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.029
Let's be friends.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.614
We still have the band.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.915
<i>-Hey, Sebas.</i>
<i>-We got you.</i>

25:00.499 --> 25:02.292
Anita is obviously fired.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.795
As for the students, the rules are clear.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.881
We have to expel everyone involved.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.134
Except Sebastián Langarica.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.844
But he's the leader of The Lodge.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.597
He's also the son
of Mexico's future president.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.518
Do you want that responsibility?

25:20.227 --> 25:23.688
No. If this gets out,
it will be a complete scandal.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.316
We have to act in EWS' best interest.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.110
What's best for the school
is setting an example,

25:29.194 --> 25:30.403
bringing justice.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.613
Justice?

25:32.739 --> 25:34.449
If life were fair,

25:34.533 --> 25:37.202
you'd be enjoying
the fruits of a successful career,

25:37.285 --> 25:39.996
instead of being a glorified babysitter.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.581
But you're not.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.668
You weren't part of RBD,
not for lack of talent,

25:45.835 --> 25:47.587
but because that's life.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.216
Of course we'll hold students accountable.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.928
I see at least a dozen students here

25:55.011 --> 25:56.846
that are easy to identify.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.349
We can expel them without a problem.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.269
If you don't like it,

26:02.769 --> 26:03.853
you can quit.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.565
And leave my students with the board?

26:07.315 --> 26:09.526
Sorry, Mr. Colucci, it won't be that easy.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.372
Do you think this is all on a whim?

26:23.164 --> 26:24.291
Quite the contrary.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.875
In fact,

26:26.626 --> 26:28.044
I'd like to make a deal.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.839
Something that can benefit everyone.

26:32.090 --> 26:32.924
Plus,

26:33.425 --> 26:35.802
I'm willing to expel someone big.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.555
What do you think?

26:44.185 --> 26:46.396
Wait for me here.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.024
Don't move.

26:53.945 --> 26:58.116
I thought The Lodge
offered protection for its members.

26:58.199 --> 27:01.202
I don't see
any protection for you, though.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.039
Don't worry about me, Luka.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.916
Don't flatter yourself.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.045
But I like your optimism,

27:10.128 --> 27:11.796
you know what's coming.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.632
A future as a karaoke waitress.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.383
Cleaning up dishes.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.305
Look, at least I know I'll be okay.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.809
I can't say the same for you.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.271
Excuse me.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.193
Mr. Colucci, come in.

27:47.582 --> 27:48.416
Guys.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.589
The board reviewed the case,

27:54.673 --> 27:55.799
and they decided

27:56.925 --> 27:59.928
The Nonames can compete in the final.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.226
And what happened with The Lodge?

28:06.309 --> 28:07.644
They'll all be expelled.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.354
They're expelling Sebas?

28:09.437 --> 28:10.730
No, not him.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.273
What?

28:12.899 --> 28:15.318
Sebastián won't be expelled from EWS.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.695
That doesn't make sense.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.531
Sebastián is the leader of The Lodge.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.366
Jana, I don't agree either.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.702
But there are
a lot of things I can't control.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.622
I don't get it. If you're not
expelling Sebastián, then who?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.213
They kicked me out.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.715
It's bullshit.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.801
I can't believe
they're trying to silence us.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.721
They want us to play
like nothing happened.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.931
-Luka, they can't do this.
-It's done.

28:45.014 --> 28:48.059
Well, if we play in the final,

28:48.143 --> 28:49.436
we can beat Sebas.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.604
That would teach him a lesson, right?

28:51.688 --> 28:53.481
So we should just keep quiet?

28:54.649 --> 28:55.692
We'd be accomplices.

28:55.775 --> 28:59.404
I know we didn't want it to be like this,
but it's our only chance.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.947
By selling out?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.407
Don't be so dramatic, Jana.

29:03.491 --> 29:06.119
I'm not.
They kicked out Luka and not Sebas.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.412
Does that seem fair?

29:07.495 --> 29:09.330
You can't only think about yourself.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.459
I have to be on that stage
or my parents are pulling me.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.627
I know and I get it.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.713
We'll find a way to prevent that.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.301
And what way is that, Ms. Know-it-all?

29:21.384 --> 29:23.928
Let's stop fighting
and think of a solution.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.474
We have to work as a team.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.058
We're not a team.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.643
It's Jana and her backup singers.

29:35.982 --> 29:36.900
Bro,

29:37.984 --> 29:40.487
I know we haven't been
the best of friends.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.698
But it's not fair you're leaving.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.284
Thanks, but it's okay.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.287
I'm sick of this shit.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.915
Marcelo screwed me. That's it.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.958
-We could…
-Jana.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.336
It's done.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.505
I have my ticket to Buenos Aires.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.298
I'm leaving soon.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.470
I'd say you could come,
but you can't afford it.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.972
-Asshole.
-We don't know if we're going to play.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.057
What do you mean?

30:10.433 --> 30:11.601
Why not?

30:11.684 --> 30:13.144
What would you do?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.272
What do I care? I have nothing to lose.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.232
They expelled me.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.859
But you're still part of The Nonames.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.445
Brother, change that name, it's terrible.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.988
Brother?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.826
What else should I call you?

30:27.909 --> 30:28.743
Bastard?

30:32.121 --> 30:35.416
What are you waiting for?
Get changed, you have to play.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.879
BATTLE OF THE BANDS
FINAL ROUND

30:47.804 --> 30:48.638
Hi, Mom.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.184
What did you think?

30:54.227 --> 30:56.437
I wouldn't find out
about your little stunt?

30:59.190 --> 31:02.277
-It didn't happen. They have no proof.
-Right.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.697
I promise I'll win, Mom.

31:06.322 --> 31:09.284
What does it matter
if you win a contest for kids?

31:09.367 --> 31:10.201
Tell me.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.788
-Are you wearing makeup?
-No.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.957
-Go take that off.
-Marina.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.542
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

31:17.625 --> 31:19.127
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.379
I know you're busy. Welcome.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.755
-It's a pleasure.
-Please.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.424
I'm going to get changed.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.343
-Watch your step. Follow me.
-Okay.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.519
Sorry, excuse me.

31:48.531 --> 31:49.407
Welcome.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.992
Thanks for coming.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.077
We hope you enjoy the show.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.372
-I'm sure we will.
-Please, ma'am, if you will.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.498
Thank you.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.458
Here you are.

31:58.541 --> 31:59.375
Thank you.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.550
There are some spots over there.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.261
Good afternoon.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.352
It's a pleasure to have you all here.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.481
Welcome to the final
of the Battle of the Bands.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.614
It's been weeks of intense competition

32:29.697 --> 32:31.199
and many obstacles.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.992
But finally, we're here.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.161
Dude, the whole fucking world came.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.079
Amazing.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.373
I know. Let's go.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.295
I think Jana and her friends got scared.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.090
Scared of you? No way.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.968
We're not the ones who ran

32:50.051 --> 32:53.054
when we found you
at your little Halloween party.

32:54.973 --> 32:55.807
What?

32:55.890 --> 32:59.394
What? Didn't he tell you
we caught him and his club?

33:00.353 --> 33:02.814
Oh, you didn't know he was in The Lodge.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.565
Shut up.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.406
Don't listen to them. Let them talk.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.784
We've already won.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.787
Well, not yet.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.288
Not yet.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.376
You good, man?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.003
I'm good.

33:33.219 --> 33:36.806
Remember that the winning band
will record a single

33:36.889 --> 33:40.685
with one of the biggest stars
in Latin America.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.732
Give it up for Hive.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.820
Ready? Let's go.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.321
Laura.

33:56.909 --> 33:57.785
Thank you.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.079
Hey, guys.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.499
What was that?

34:04.542 --> 34:05.668
Emilia, what was that?

34:05.752 --> 34:06.627
Nothing.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.888
<i>Stuck on your planet</i>

34:20.391 --> 34:23.644
<i>For a while, that was never</i>

34:24.437 --> 34:25.313
<i>My plan</i>

34:27.106 --> 34:30.568
<i>But my spaceship broke down</i>

34:33.654 --> 34:35.990
<i>And now I'm</i>

34:37.116 --> 34:41.329
<i>Lost in these mornings with three suns</i>

34:41.412 --> 34:44.499
<i>And multiple visions</i>

34:44.582 --> 34:47.710
<i>Transparent mountains</i>

34:47.794 --> 34:50.922
<i>Anemones of light</i>

34:51.589 --> 34:53.800
<i>Particles of love</i>

34:54.717 --> 34:58.262
<i>And memories of you</i>…

35:01.891 --> 35:04.185
Please give a big round of applause

35:04.268 --> 35:06.270
for Andi Agosti and Emilia Alo.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.857
Andi! Come here.

35:09.941 --> 35:10.775
-Come.
-What?

35:11.359 --> 35:12.401
What are you doing?

35:13.736 --> 35:14.570
What now?

35:21.786 --> 35:23.079
What are you doing?

35:23.162 --> 35:25.206
You wanted everyone to know, right?

35:29.544 --> 35:31.045
<i>Love</i>

35:31.129 --> 35:32.338
<i>Love</i>

35:32.421 --> 35:33.548
<i>Love</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:37.885
<i>Love</i>

35:37.969 --> 35:39.470
<i>Love</i>

35:39.554 --> 35:42.181
<i>Love</i>

35:42.932 --> 35:43.808
<i>Love</i>

35:44.559 --> 35:45.476
<i>Love</i>

35:46.060 --> 35:47.019
<i>Love</i>

35:49.480 --> 35:51.107
<i>Love</i>

35:51.190 --> 35:52.567
<i>Love</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:55.278
<i>Love</i>

35:55.778 --> 35:57.822
<i>I just want to give you love</i>

36:01.909 --> 36:05.037
<i>I just want to give you love</i>

36:05.121 --> 36:08.583
<i>That's all I want</i>

36:08.666 --> 36:12.086
<i>I just want to give you love</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:13.838
<i>That's all I want…</i>

36:19.051 --> 36:20.553
What happened to our act?

36:21.679 --> 36:22.513
Your act.

36:23.639 --> 36:24.557
I quit.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.104
No, please.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.523
I already have.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.362
<i>I just want to give you love</i>

36:38.446 --> 36:41.866
<i>That's all I want</i>

36:46.787 --> 36:49.123
Hive!

36:52.877 --> 36:54.879
-Congrats!
-Good job.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.465
That was good!

36:57.548 --> 36:59.592
Good luck.

36:59.675 --> 37:00.593
Good job!

37:01.344 --> 37:02.303
Congratulations.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.056
Let's move on to our next finalists.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.934
Let's give a big round of applause

37:08.017 --> 37:09.018
for XY<i>.</i>

37:19.987 --> 37:21.322
What are you thinking?

37:24.116 --> 37:25.868
-XY?
-What are you doing?

37:25.952 --> 37:28.412
I know what you're going to do, okay?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.289
I don't have a choice.

37:33.000 --> 37:33.918
Guys?

37:42.635 --> 37:45.721
That's the intro, go into F major.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.224
-Okay.
-I'm on violin, you take piano.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.309
Okay, got it.

38:03.114 --> 38:08.119
<i>You always said you'd never leave</i>
<i>If it didn't go well for you</i>

38:08.202 --> 38:13.833
<i>Not fighting for what you want</i>
<i>Is just losing</i>

38:14.417 --> 38:19.297
<i>If I hurt you, it's because I'm careless</i>
<i>Not because I don't care</i>

38:19.380 --> 38:21.424
<i>Tell me what you prefer</i>

38:21.507 --> 38:25.303
<i>To have or to fear</i>

38:25.928 --> 38:28.597
<i>You only think about how it will end</i>

38:28.681 --> 38:31.350
<i>I keep thinking how I'll end up</i>

38:31.434 --> 38:34.020
<i>One day you say you can't</i>

38:34.103 --> 38:36.981
<i>I feel like I never had you</i>

38:37.064 --> 38:39.775
<i>I did everything to make you stay</i>

38:39.859 --> 38:42.403
<i>What do I have left?</i>

38:42.486 --> 38:45.197
<i>Lost time, maybe I won</i>

38:45.281 --> 38:48.451
<i>I went from missing you to saying</i>

38:48.534 --> 38:52.788
<i>I'm sorry for wasting your time</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:55.750
<i>For trying again</i>

38:55.833 --> 38:59.795
<i>For thinking this fight</i>
<i>Would make you happy</i>

38:59.879 --> 39:03.758
<i>I break</i>
<i>Sometimes I don't even understand myself</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:07.136
<i>How can I understand this</i>

39:07.219 --> 39:10.306
<i>If I never understood you?</i>

39:10.931 --> 39:13.768
<i>You always said you'd never leave</i>

39:13.851 --> 39:15.853
<i>If it didn't go well for you</i>

39:15.936 --> 39:17.855
<i>Not fighting for what you want</i>

39:17.938 --> 39:22.151
<i>Is just losing</i>

39:22.234 --> 39:27.156
<i>If I hurt you, it's because I'm careless</i>
<i>Not because I don't care</i>

39:27.239 --> 39:29.283
<i>Tell me what you prefer</i>

39:29.367 --> 39:33.496
<i>To have or to fear</i>

39:42.797 --> 39:46.384
XY!

39:51.305 --> 39:55.393
Thank you, XY,
for that amazing performance.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.105
We're getting close
to the end of the show.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.482
Who's your favorite so far?

40:03.150 --> 40:05.361
We have a third finalist.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.823
Please give a big round of applause
for The Nonames.

40:11.826 --> 40:12.701
Break a leg.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.592
I'm sure you're wondering

40:28.676 --> 40:31.637
why we're in the final
after getting disqualified.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.140
The truth is

40:34.223 --> 40:36.475
the school board offered us a deal.

40:37.643 --> 40:41.313
They asked for our silence
so we could be on stage today.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.690
But we won't stay quiet.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.651
This school is the home of The Lodge,

40:45.734 --> 40:49.780
a secret group that works for the benefit
of the most influential students.

40:50.781 --> 40:54.076
They're the ones that started
the hazing that got out of control.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.995
They beat up Esteban.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.746
They deleted our video.

40:57.830 --> 41:01.041
In fact, the president of The Lodge
is Sebastián Langarica.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.334
You all know him.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.630
The school board knows this
but they didn't do anything.

41:06.714 --> 41:10.050
We won't stay quiet,
even if it means being disqualified.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.595
They already expelled me,

41:13.220 --> 41:14.513
so I don't give a shit.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.599
-Luka, get down from there.
-No.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.559
Please, ladies and gentlemen,

41:18.642 --> 41:20.936
enjoy the show.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.737
What are you doing with your phones?

41:40.331 --> 41:41.415
What is that?

41:44.668 --> 41:46.337
Ma'am, don't…

41:46.962 --> 41:49.173
Celina, this band is disqualified.

41:49.757 --> 41:50.591
Mom.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.177
What is this, Sebastián?

41:53.928 --> 41:54.762
Huh?

41:56.055 --> 41:57.264
You don't have anything to say?

42:00.768 --> 42:02.645
You're a Langarica, damn it.

42:08.442 --> 42:09.860
Let's go, Nonames!

42:09.944 --> 42:11.570
Let's go!

42:12.446 --> 42:13.906
What are you doing?

42:13.989 --> 42:16.325
Get down from there, you're disqualified.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.118
We are…

42:21.205 --> 42:22.081
Rebel!

42:26.126 --> 42:30.422
<i>While my mind travels where you are</i>

42:31.382 --> 42:35.386
<i>My father yells at me again</i>

42:36.762 --> 42:41.058
<i>He says I'm wasting my future</i>
<i>And his peace</i>

42:42.184 --> 42:45.729
<i>Because of how I am</i>

42:47.356 --> 42:52.528
<i>As I hear him, I'm far away</i>

42:52.611 --> 42:59.159
<i>I close my eyes and think of you</i>

43:01.787 --> 43:03.831
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:04.665 --> 43:07.001
<i>When I don't follow others</i>

43:07.084 --> 43:09.295
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:09.378 --> 43:11.880
<i>When I love you like crazy</i>

43:11.964 --> 43:13.716
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:14.383 --> 43:17.136
<i>Thinking differently from yesterday</i>

43:17.219 --> 43:18.887
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:19.555 --> 43:22.558
<i>When I put myself on the line</i>

43:33.569 --> 43:37.656
<i>I don't really care what they say about me</i>

43:38.157 --> 43:42.369
<i>I close my eyes and think of you</i>

43:42.453 --> 43:44.121
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:44.705 --> 43:47.750
<i>When I don't follow others</i>

43:47.833 --> 43:49.668
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:49.752 --> 43:52.379
<i>When I love you like crazy</i>

43:52.463 --> 43:54.256
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:54.840 --> 43:57.384
<i>Thinking differently from yesterday</i>

43:57.468 --> 43:59.470
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

43:59.970 --> 44:03.307
<i>When I put myself on the line</i>

44:12.316 --> 44:14.610
<i>I am a Rebel</i>

44:25.120 --> 44:30.376
Rebel!

45:04.326 --> 45:06.870
-What's wrong with you, Luka?
-Calm down.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.080
Take it down a notch.

45:08.163 --> 45:10.666
Why don't you take it down a notch
and explain yourself?

45:11.333 --> 45:13.627
No. You won't have to see me again.

45:14.628 --> 45:17.715
And when you feel the urge
to scream or humiliate someone,

45:17.798 --> 45:19.508
you have your other son.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.511
What other son?

45:23.846 --> 45:25.222
-What do you mean?
-Bye.

45:25.305 --> 45:27.516
What? Where are you going, Luka?

45:27.599 --> 45:29.893
-Let's go.
-Hey, Luka!

45:31.228 --> 45:32.312
Luka!

45:32.396 --> 45:33.397
Bye, Dad.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.491
