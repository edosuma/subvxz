WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:05.755
- Hello?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.424
Anyone up?

00:07.507 --> 00:08.925
No?

00:09.008 --> 00:10.885
[laughs] Good. Then I got
home at 10:00.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.722
- STEPH: 10:00, my butt.
- GABBY: [gasping]

00:13.805 --> 00:15.056
What is your problem?

00:15.140 --> 00:17.600
You said I could take an extra
half hour for curfew.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.853
- Oh, you took it
all the way to an hour.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.771
- Oh, my bad.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.398
- No, no, no, no.
No "my bad."

00:23.481 --> 00:26.443
My bad is when you borrow
a shirt without asking.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.904
- Oh...
Yeah, my bad. My bad.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.115
[laughing]
Good talk. 'Night.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.159
- You're grounded
for two weeks.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.118
- It's just a shirt.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.746
- No, you're grounded
for being late.

00:37.829 --> 00:38.955
- [mimicking] You're grounded
for being late.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.459
- Just for that--
make it four weeks.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.627
- Seriously?
I hate this house!

00:44.711 --> 00:46.337
- Wash that shirt!
- Oh, I'll wash it, all right.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.299
Maybe it'll shrink
so it actually fits me.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.092
- You know what? A month.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.428
- Four weeks is a month!

00:53.511 --> 00:56.139
- Uh, two months!
[groaning]

00:56.222 --> 00:57.807
Everyone's always trying
to get away with stuff

00:57.891 --> 00:59.392
just because I'm wonderful.

{\an8}- James the Magnificent
and my assistant, Tiny Wonder.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.753
{\an8}- That's me--Tiny Wonder.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.922
{\an8}- We'll make a card
magically appear.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.674
{\an8}Tiny Wonder, magic arm.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.510
{\an8}- Bawamo! Shazam!

01:33.593 --> 01:36.346
{\an8}- Your card was
the Nine of Hearts.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.682
{\an8}- Nope, it was
the King of Diamonds.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.477
{\an8}- That's the Four of Clubs.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.521
{\an8}- No, it was
the King of Diamonds.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.648
{\an8}- Are you sure?
Maybe you forgot.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.358
{\an8}You're at that age.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.154
{\an8}- King of Diamonds.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.156
{\an8}Sorry, James, I think you
need a little more practice

01:55.240 --> 01:56.991
{\an8}before you're "Magnificent."

01:57.075 --> 02:00.703
{\an8}Right now you're just
kinda James the Meh.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.163
{\an8}- Hilarious.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.249
{\an8}I'll have to use that witty
banter in my act.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.334
{\an8}- CHARLIE: [laughing]

02:06.417 --> 02:07.961
{\an8}- Tiny Wonder, disappear me.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.088
{\an8}- Yeah, I'd like to see that.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.298
{\an8}- I'd do it, but Gabby's
in the backyard

02:12.382 --> 02:14.843
{\an8}making out with some
bearded guy in a van.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.179
{\an8}- What?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.014
{\an8}Gabby's not out there.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.349
- Bawamo! Shazam!

02:25.436 --> 02:26.563
- Have you seen Gabby's room?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.357
Because I can't under
all her piles of stuff.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.525
And I can't prove it,
but I know she's using

02:30.608 --> 02:34.863
my good perfume because
that girl smells fantastic.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.614
- Stop telling people
I use your perfume.

02:36.698 --> 02:41.119
I only smell like you because
you're always in my business.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.204
And why were you in my room?

02:43.288 --> 02:45.206
I knew somebody moved
all my stuff around.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.333
I have a system.
- Oh, I have a system, too.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.710
And if it's not in
your closet by dinner,

02:48.793 --> 02:51.880
it'll be on a homeless
person by breakfast.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.798
- You are so insane.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.967
- Hi! Hi! Hi!

02:56.050 --> 02:57.760
- Oh, you don't know insane.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.680
This is insane.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.390
While I was at school one day,

03:02.473 --> 03:06.269
my mom went in my room and
cleaned it with a leaf blower.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.814
- Why are you draggin'
me into whatever this is?

03:09.898 --> 03:13.234
I just came over to
borrow a little wine

03:13.318 --> 03:16.821
and a little premium cable.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.240
- Try living with her.
You'll see how good you have it.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.367
- Maybe I should.
- Maybe you should.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.952
- Maybe I will.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.079
Hey, Grandma Maggie,
can I move in with you?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.998
- Unh-unh. No-o-o-o-o.

03:27.081 --> 03:31.753
- Yeah. Unh-unh. No-o-o-o-o.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.546
- Don't worry, Charlie, my mom
was never gonna take her.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.592
She doesn't have the patience
to raise this child.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.928
- Gabby, go on and get
your suitcase

03:40.011 --> 03:42.764
and meet me in my car.

03:42.847 --> 03:43.973
- What?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.893
- Thanks, roomie.
[laughing]

03:46.976 --> 03:49.938
- Mom, what do you think
you're doing?

03:50.021 --> 03:53.066
- Borrowing a chicken.

03:53.149 --> 03:57.028
My grandbaby loves
her piccata!

03:58.947 --> 04:00.573
- I really wanna yell
at you right now.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.326
But you seem like
you're in a place.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.620
You just sent our daughter
to live with your mother.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.622
- Ah, it's just a glorified
sleepover, Charlie.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.248
By tomorrow, my mom
is gonna kick her out,

04:09.332 --> 04:12.293
or Gabby's gonna run
home screaming.

04:12.377 --> 04:17.130
Uh, why do I have a playing card
in my bag of lettuce?

04:17.214 --> 04:21.052
- Wait a minute.
That's the King of Diamonds.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.387
How did they--

04:22.470 --> 04:25.515
- Bawamo! Shazam!

04:25.598 --> 04:28.309
- Tiny Wonder, set out
the tip jar.

04:32.981 --> 04:37.235
Okay, Dad, we are ready
to amaze and astound you.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.947
- You can try. But I figured
out your card trick.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.992
You used sleight of hand
to pocket my card.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.536
- And how did I get it
in a sealed lettuce bag?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.997
- Easy. Stephanie
was in on it.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.248
- Nope, we did it last night

04:50.331 --> 04:54.002
when we were stealing
the cookie jar.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.586
- Aaron!
- What?

04:55.670 --> 05:00.174
It's not like I told him how we
used an iron to reseal the bag.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.678
- Tiny Wonder, bawamo, shut up.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.807
That trick may be ruined,
but this will confound you.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.185
Tiny Wonder,
get in position.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.087
- Ha!

05:38.171 --> 05:40.048
Hah!

05:40.131 --> 05:41.841
- AARON: [groaning]

05:41.924 --> 05:44.802
Ow!

05:44.886 --> 05:48.514
- Tiny Wonder, do you have
any last words?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.391
- Just...two.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.311
Bawamo! Shazam!

05:53.394 --> 05:55.104
- Ha!

05:58.274 --> 06:00.193
And that's how it's done.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.198
Yaaaah!

06:08.493 --> 06:10.078
- Hi! Hi! Hi!

06:10.161 --> 06:11.913
- Ah, look who's back.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.623
- I'm not back. I just
came to get some clothes

06:13.706 --> 06:16.417
because I'm staying longer
at Grandma Maggie's.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.461
- MAGGIE: Because
we love living together.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.296
- Oh, you know it.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.965
All the chicken piccata
I can eat.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.301
- Oh, I get it.
It's a drop 'n run.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.594
Don't worry, we'll keep
Gabby upstairs

06:26.677 --> 06:28.554
so you can sneak out back.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.057
Apology accepted.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.018
- Mm-hm.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.063
Gabby and I were
just talking about this--

06:37.146 --> 06:39.107
how underhanded you are--

06:39.190 --> 06:41.484
while we were giving
each other manicures.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.947
That girl really knows her
way around a French tip.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.574
- [sighing]
This glorified sleepover

06:48.658 --> 06:50.952
is starting to look like
a glorified adoption.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.955
- Relax, Charlie, they're still
in the honeymoon phase.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.041
- Oh, I remember
the honeymoon phase.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
That's right before
you bring her home

06:59.127 --> 07:01.963
and she tries to
fix your family.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.423
- I don't think I like
your attitude, Charlie.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.050
- CHARLIE: Oh.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.469
- Magnificent. Wonder.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.679
- Ready for another trick?

07:09.762 --> 07:12.390
- No, I still have a question
about the first one.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.392
I get how you got the card
into the lettuce,

07:14.475 --> 07:16.519
but how did you know
I was gonna pick that card?

07:16.602 --> 07:18.020
- I'll never tell.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.022
I mean, do you tell people
how you cut a heart out?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.233
- I have to.
It's a teaching hospital.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.527
- Well, magicians
have a code.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.362
- Even if you torture us,
we couldn't tell you

07:26.445 --> 07:29.657
that every card in the deck
was the King of Diamonds.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.076
So don't even ask.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.245
- Dude, that's it.
You're fired.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.164
- What?
- Turn in your turban.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.332
- Seriously?

07:38.416 --> 07:40.626
Can I at least keep
the spangley unitard?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.795
- Yes, because I never
told you to buy that.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.510
- Hey, Stephanie,
Gabby's here.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.429
Does that mean
she's moving back?

07:51.512 --> 07:54.849
- No, your dad just asked her
and my mom over for dinner.

07:54.932 --> 07:55.850
- But she's been
gone for like days.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.853
Don't you miss her?
- Of course, I miss her.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.855
There's nothing more
important than family.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.356
- Then ask her to come home.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.443
- Are you crazy?
I have to win.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.613
Gabby and Grandma Maggie need
to be sick of each other.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.573
- You know, Stephanie,

08:10.656 --> 08:13.075
if you're having a problem
with everybody...

08:13.159 --> 08:15.036
you might be the problem.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.501
- Where are those
noise-cancelling headphones?

08:22.585 --> 08:25.171
I've got an awful noise
I need to cancel.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.797
- Is it this?

08:26.881 --> 08:30.760
[high-pitched screaming]

08:35.347 --> 08:38.976
- No, it's Grandma
Maggie's voice.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.062
I mean, she's on me
about everything.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.520
She's so fussy
about her stuff,

08:42.605 --> 08:44.524
I can't even touch
the thermostat.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.651
It's awful.
I wanna come home.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.236
- Then come home.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.989
- Are you crazy?
I have to win.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.950
No, Grandma Maggie's
gotta kick me out.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.244
In the meantime, I just have
to choke down more piccata.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.287
- I thought that's
your favorite.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.830
- Chicken Piccata.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.624
But she ran outta chicken
three days ago.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.459
Now I don't know what
she's been piccata'ing,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.670
but a lot of it's been
goin' off the balcony.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.426
- Oh, good, Gabby's
not in here.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.514
Ohhh, I need a break
from that girl.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.057
- Why?
- Because...

09:18.140 --> 09:21.018
she always has her
phone on her ear,

09:21.102 --> 09:22.812
her feet on my couch,

09:22.895 --> 09:27.733
and her funky little attitude
on my last nerve.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.485
Oooooh!

09:29.568 --> 09:32.530
That girl has got to go.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.824
- Can't you just
kick her out?

09:34.907 --> 09:37.535
- Are you crazy?
I have to win.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.079
- These headphones
drown out jetliners,

09:40.162 --> 09:41.706
yet I can still hear you.

09:41.789 --> 09:45.042
- You're about to hear
my foot up your a-a-a...

09:45.126 --> 09:47.628
a-a-a-ay, baby.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.338
- Dinner's ready.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.215
- Oh, I hope we're sitting
next to each other.

09:51.299 --> 09:55.636
- Oh, because we just
can't stand to be apart.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.139
- You guys are ridiculous.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.765
Why don't one of you
be brave enough

09:59.849 --> 10:03.019
to say what you're
really thinking.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.438
- Okay, fine, I'll say it.

10:05.521 --> 10:09.483
Who dressed this child up
like a Black Liberace?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.072
- All right, ladies, you wanna
be a magician's assistant?

10:15.156 --> 10:18.326
You've gotta wow me--let me
see your best ta-da hands.
