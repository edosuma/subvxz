00:01.502 --> 00:04.338
Tonight, global business
tycoon Peter Jones returns to
the Tank.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.773
I could take this product
and sell it all over the world.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.042
Pour yourself a glass,
and let's get down to business.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.211
We are disrupting
conventional thinking.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.680
Help me create
the next great worldwide brand.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.616
Which one of you wants to join
the Nana King?

00:15.716 --> 00:17.551
Bananas to the moon,
baby!

00:17.651 --> 00:19.319
You think you've got
the dream ticket.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.388
The reality is,
this could go out of fashion.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.557
It's not worth $7.5 million.
It's worth $20 million.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.791
It's cool.
Mark brought it up.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.059
I wasn't even thinking royalty.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.694
Yes, you were.
You're taking me seriously now.

00:27.794 --> 00:28.896
I've got a feeling
that one day

00:28.996 --> 00:30.197
you're going to regret
this moment.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.765
If either one of us
don't do this deal,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.400
our lives
are not gonna change.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.801
We're still gonna be rich.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.877
First in the Tank

00:43.977 --> 00:47.881
is a way to be comfortable
and still look professional.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.323
Hi, Sharks.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.358
I'm Justin Baer
from Bethesda, Maryland,

00:58.458 --> 01:00.794
and today I'm seeking $300,000

01:00.894 --> 01:04.364
for 4% of my innovative
apparel company, Collars & Co.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.033
4%?

01:06.133 --> 01:10.070
Sharks, welcome
to Business Casual 101.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.171
Let's begin.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.973
So, you know this look

01:13.073 --> 01:15.442
where you're wearing
a dress shirt under a sweater?

01:15.542 --> 01:18.211
It's pretty much the go-to
look for every single guy

01:18.312 --> 01:20.714
that works in an office
around the world.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.149
I lived in New York
for 12 years.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.418
This is what's called
the Midtown uniform.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.787
Problem is, I hated wearing
a long-sleeve dress shirt

01:26.887 --> 01:28.021
under a sweater.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.358
It was always hot
and uncomfortable and scratchy.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.459
I didn't want to have to spend
the time

01:32.559 --> 01:33.460
buttoning up my shirt
in the morning.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.362
And then sometimes
you'd also get

01:35.462 --> 01:37.464
what's called floppy collar,

01:37.564 --> 01:40.167
where the collar just flops
down halfway through the day.

01:40.267 --> 01:45.539
But worst of all was putting
on a dress shirt under a sweater.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.940
It is so annoying!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.742
The sleeves always
get bunched up.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.711
My sleeve's, like,
right up there by elbow.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.213
Sharks, I knew there had to be
a better way,

01:53.313 --> 01:57.684
which is why I invented
the dress collar polo.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.786
It's a stretchy,
comfortable golf shirt,

01:59.886 --> 02:02.289
except the top has a firm
collar on it,

02:02.389 --> 02:04.391
so it gives you that exact
same look of a dress shirt,

02:04.491 --> 02:06.393
but it's really just
a comfortable polo.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.729
Sharks, guys are wearing this
with a tie,

02:08.829 --> 02:11.131
under a blazer,
with a sweater,

02:11.231 --> 02:13.767
and even for just a slightly
more elevated casual look,

02:13.867 --> 02:15.168
with a polo.

02:15.268 --> 02:19.072
Sharks, we are helping guys
look stylish and stay comfortable,

02:19.172 --> 02:21.241
and we've created
a new category of shirt.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.710
Help me create
the next great worldwide brand.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.711
Thank you.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.879
In front of you,

02:25.979 --> 02:27.981
we actually have
four different collar styles.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.585
It's a nice stretchy material.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.520
Yeah, it's stretchy.
Seems lightweight, breathable.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.322
Totally breathable.

02:35.422 --> 02:39.092
Quite an interesting idea.
Did you say 4%?

02:39.192 --> 02:40.727
4%. Yeah.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.229
4%. Okay. Yeah.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.597
So, sales so far.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.632
We started last year.

02:45.732 --> 02:49.069
We've sold so far 92,000
shirts for $5.4 million.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.937
Whoa!
Whoa!

02:51.038 --> 02:51.905
Whoa.
Whoa. Wow.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.340
Direct to consumer or...

02:53.440 --> 02:55.475
All direct to consumer,
all online.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.544
What was your profit margin
on that?

02:57.644 --> 02:58.945
20% net.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.213
Justin,
I got to tell you...

03:00.313 --> 03:01.281
Okay. Wow.
That's impressive.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.616
Yeah.

03:02.716 --> 03:07.120
So, this is a really,
really well-made product.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.221
Thank you.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.657
But there's two things
I hate.

03:10.757 --> 03:14.828
I hate, with all my heart,
this look.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.998
I've always hated
that Midtown look.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.133
It's just not my style.
I really hate that look.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.403
Another thing is, I hate
offers at 4% for $300,000.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.605
I'm out.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.240
That answers that.
O'Leary: All right.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.609
We've had other shirt
companies on "Shark Tank."

03:29.710 --> 03:32.245
However, of all the ones
in 14 years,

03:32.345 --> 03:33.947
you've had the fastest growth
to $5 million.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.315
I always consider that
a hurdle.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.284
Getting to $5 million,
that's a real business. Yeah.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.587
So you must have some
executional skills in this story

03:40.687 --> 03:42.122
that others don't have.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.591
You're right, Kevin.
The secret is in our marketing.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.960
It's in our funnel.
We've mastered the funnel.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.795
I've been doing this
for 20 years.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.197
Doing what
for 20 years?

03:50.297 --> 03:52.733
Business, Internet marketing.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.234
I had a business
in one of the first

03:54.334 --> 03:55.635
check-in applications
for events.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.070
Let me jump in.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.371
I mean,
while these are super nice,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.307
I think what you're doing
is fantastic,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.576
I don't think it's
the right investment for me.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.712
So I wish you good luck,
and I will purchase as gifts.
Thank you.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.114
But I'm out.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.515
Thank you.
Thank you.

04:08.615 --> 04:12.119
Justin, I'm quite shocked,
because I'm in this business.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.087
I own a company
called Localised,

04:14.187 --> 04:16.990
and we basically take big
brands global all over the
world--

04:17.090 --> 04:20.727
this type of product,
specifically, across Asia.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.729
Yeah.
We're seeing growth,
but we're not seeing it

04:22.829 --> 04:25.699
at the stage that you've just
taken this business to.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.434
What does it cost
to make?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.536
Cost to make landed, $15.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.972
We sell it anywhere
from $65 to $75.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.541
Okay.
I've never bid at a shirt deal.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.010
'Cause, "Oh, shirts.
That's a total commodity."

04:37.110 --> 04:38.478
But you have numbers
to justify it.

04:38.578 --> 04:42.816
First time in 14 years I'm
gonna make an offer to a shirt deal.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.285
I look at it and say,
"$300,000, 4%

04:45.385 --> 04:46.620
doesn't even get me out of bed
to put a shirt on

04:46.720 --> 04:47.687
in the first place."

04:47.788 --> 04:49.923
No.
I'll do it for 10%.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.259
No way. Kevin...

04:52.359 --> 04:53.960
You're a decisive dude.
That's good.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.630
If this was an old-line
private-equity deal,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.832
old, slow growth, cash flow--

04:58.932 --> 05:00.734
This is one of
the fastest-growing D2C brands

05:00.834 --> 05:01.802
in the country.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.804
We're growing at 28% a month.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.272
When you hit that wall,
though--

05:05.372 --> 05:07.073
It's all the reason
I'm making the offer.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.708
Do you have other investors?
Justin. Justin.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.977
I have no other investors.
I'm just the only one.
Justin. To make--

05:11.077 --> 05:12.045
Justin.
Yeah.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.447
You've completely dismissed
an offer

05:14.548 --> 05:17.083
that I thought was
pretty good.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.820
No way.
What sort of equity <i>are</i>
you talking about, then?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.088
You came in with $300,000
for 4%.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.257
You've dismissed
as if Mr. Wonderful

05:24.357 --> 05:25.692
wasn't even in the room.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.328
That's at 10%
Well, that's
at $3 million valuation.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.363
This thing,
I pushed it for $7.5 million.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.866
It's not worth $7.5 million.
It's worth $20 million.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.301
Why is it worth
$20 million?

05:34.401 --> 05:35.435
Because this thing is--

05:35.535 --> 05:37.604
What is your free EBITDA?
What is it?

05:37.704 --> 05:39.272
20%. We made $1 million
over $5 million.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.308
Justin--
Justin, what do you need?

05:41.408 --> 05:43.877
Inventory, marketing,
and we need to build a team.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.712
If we're gonna go
to $50 million,

05:45.812 --> 05:47.347
we need to have
some key players in place. Okay.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.882
So how are you gonna get
the money for inventory?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.617
So are you looking to raise,
are you looking to finance?

05:50.717 --> 05:52.819
We're gonna need
a line of credit also. Okay.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.822
But the other thing
that I'm looking for is a mentor

05:55.922 --> 05:58.191
and somebody
to help me grow this thing

05:58.291 --> 05:59.559
really to the next level.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.361
This is--
You know what?

06:01.461 --> 06:02.963
I'll mentor you.
Take the 10% offer.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.532
That was my mentorship.
This could be the next--

06:05.632 --> 06:07.133
the next great brand.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.170
I don't know whether you know
this market as well as I do.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.005
This is beyond brutal.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.407
And the reason
why this is just so brutal

06:14.507 --> 06:18.745
is because fashion shifts and
moves at a literally rapid rate.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.280
And you are up here
at the moment,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.315
and you think
you've got the dream ticket

06:22.415 --> 06:23.383
coming into "Shark Tank."

06:23.483 --> 06:27.320
The reality is,
in six to twelve months,

06:27.420 --> 06:28.555
this could go
out of fashion.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.023
Here's the reality, Peter.
I don't know.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.291
I don't think it's going
out of fashion.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.093
Peter--
Peter, here's the reality.
But it could.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.794
I don't think so.
Here's the reality.
We're going into a recession.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.863
People aren't buying shirts,
and they can't pay their mortgage.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.131
Correct.
Right?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.466
Then he starts bringing in
more--

06:39.566 --> 06:41.468
He has a lot of SKUs.
He starts bringing in more.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.436
You know,
some things don't get sold.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.372
He doesn't have a second door
like Burlington

06:45.472 --> 06:46.673
or any place
to get rid of this.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.843
And now his inventory starts
to chew into his profits.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.745
And then he realizes,
"Oh, wait a minute.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.446
I don't know
as much as I thought."

06:53.546 --> 06:55.615
Absolutely. And--
But, Daymond, these shirts--
These are core styles.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.051
that we'll have for 30 years.
When I got in the business,

06:58.151 --> 07:00.820
Levi's was doing $18 billion.
They're doing $4 billion now.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.389
Everything goes
out of style.
Justin-- Justin--
Justin--

07:02.489 --> 07:04.324
Well...
I'm about to make you
an offer.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.458
Listen.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.828
You need to cut out cost.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.730
I have
that infrastructure,

07:10.830 --> 07:13.099
and I could take this product
and sell it all over the world.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.801
So I'm gonna
make you an offer. Okay.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.804
But my offer is also at 10%
for $300,000.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.940
No.
O'Leary:
You must be kidding.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.042
Justin-- Justin...
Honestly.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.810
Why'd you even come in here?
You knew we were gonna do that.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.145
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold up.
No!

07:25.245 --> 07:26.413
At $3 million valuation?

07:26.513 --> 07:28.281
You're gonna go from 4%
to, what, 5%?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.916
Justin...
What do you mean?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.651
Well, why don't you
just go down to 2%?
He's out, Justin, so look.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.486
$300,000 is obviously
not enough.

07:33.586 --> 07:34.888
So you already have
in mind

07:34.988 --> 07:37.257
where you're going to go get
your additional capital.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.391
I mean, we need--

07:38.491 --> 07:40.760
we need probably
a $700,000 line of credit.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.928
All right.
That's easy.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.430
So if I went in
with Peter--

07:43.530 --> 07:45.131
So, Peter,
so if you handle global,

07:45.231 --> 07:47.000
domestic,
and I don't mind putting up--

07:47.100 --> 07:48.735
and I'm sure Peter
wouldn't either--

07:48.835 --> 07:50.236
um, a line of credit
at 8%, 9%--

07:50.337 --> 07:52.939
whatever the interest rate
should be--
8%, 9%?

07:53.039 --> 07:54.674
Yeah, 'cause rates
are going up.
No!

07:54.774 --> 07:57.644
For a line of credit?
He's a tough-- tough
negotiator you are, Justin.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.213
For a line of credit?
Mark, but we have inventory.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.715
We have assets--
hard assets.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.917
I know you guys give out line
of credits to apps and stuff.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.186
There's nothing tangible.
You have clothing
as inventory.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.555
Even if you got 50%--
Justin,
you didn't even flinch

08:08.655 --> 08:10.156
when he said
"me and Peter together,"

08:10.256 --> 08:11.958
which they both have shared
with you huge backgrounds.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.526
Then you make us an offer.

08:13.626 --> 08:14.761
Justin,
you make us an offer.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.563
Yeah, 'cause it seems like
we're wasting time here.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.365
No.
Everything they say to you
is like, "No!"

08:18.465 --> 08:19.766
So what are you doing?
Well, you're--

08:19.866 --> 08:21.835
you're valuing this and you're
not really seeing the--

08:21.935 --> 08:23.636
You get a chance to--
No, we're seeing that,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.305
and we're seeing that there's
gonna be 10 more people

08:25.405 --> 08:27.073
through the door in another
minute, so what's your offer?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.342
So, Justin, I'll include

08:29.442 --> 08:31.211
the $700,000 line of credit,
but $300,000 cash.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.581
What is the equity
you're willing to offer us?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.192
Two Sharks are out.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.529
Kevin and Peter have
each offered $300,000

08:49.629 --> 08:53.433
for 10% of Justin's
shirt company, Collars & Co.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.102
Mark is willing to go in
with Peter

08:56.202 --> 08:59.739
and has offered an additional
$700,000 line of credit.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.308
But he wants a bigger chunk
of equity

09:02.409 --> 09:04.711
than the 4%
Justin came in offering

09:04.811 --> 09:07.881
and has asked him to make
his best and final offer.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.883
What is the equity
you're willing to offer us?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.986
5%.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.054
Wow.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.525
But look.
I think 10% is too much.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.860
I just think 10% is too much.
So when you say that,
Justin--

09:20.960 --> 09:22.095
Let me clean
something up here,

09:22.195 --> 09:23.630
make your decision-making
easier.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.632
10% is too much?
I'm out.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.235
Okay. Yeah. Th-- You're val--
You're not valuing-- This is--

09:29.335 --> 09:31.771
Justin, I know the
value of this business,

09:31.871 --> 09:35.375
and you've done really well
to get a 10% offer.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.510
So you're saying
it's worth .5--

09:37.610 --> 09:39.312
No. The incremental--
Wait. Wait.
If we're gonna do--

09:39.412 --> 09:41.047
First of all, we're gonna
$10 million in sales this year.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.349
You want me to valuate
at .3 sales?
The thing is, Justin--

09:43.450 --> 09:45.518
The problem is-- Listen.
This is why in a partnership--

09:45.618 --> 09:46.853
Mark knows
that's not gonna work.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.455
No, no, no.
But you've got to have--

09:48.555 --> 09:51.491
You have two ears
for a reason, right?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.493
And I don't think
you're listening.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.894
And that's not good.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.130
That's not a good sign
from an entrepreneur.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.065
No, no.
You do have to listen.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.301
I'm listening.
You can dismiss it
and you can walk out of here.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.469
That's absolutely fine.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.404
But we should be allowed
to voice our opinion.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.106
And you're not allowing me
to voice mine

10:06.206 --> 10:07.941
'cause you keep
talking over me.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.410
No, I hear what you're saying.
Which lets me know
that you're not listening.

10:10.510 --> 10:14.247
You have everything right now
in the palm of your hands.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.617
And for 6%-- That's all
that we're talking about--
6%.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.854
You have no idea what the
scale of the opportunity is

10:20.954 --> 10:23.823
and what we're going to add,
and the value to that--

10:23.923 --> 10:25.024
You're discounting it.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.593
No, I'm not discounting
what you guys bring,

10:26.693 --> 10:27.994
and that's why I'm here.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.295
But we're gonna do $10 million
in sales.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.563
But what about if we take it
to $200 million?

10:30.663 --> 10:32.065
Justin,
but with the two of them,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.000
you could actually
be doing $80 million.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.137
So you're talking to guys
who've been in the business 30 years.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.105
We see deals like this
all day long.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.307
If either one of us
don't do this deal,

10:41.407 --> 10:43.143
our lives
are not gonna change.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.044
We're still gonna be rich.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.983
Justin, you're asking us
to go to work for you.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.719
There is no amount you could
pay to hire the two of us

10:52.819 --> 10:55.388
to mentor you and help you--
him globally.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.923
I couldn't even hire him.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.492
If you're valuing your company
at $20 million and 10%--

10:59.592 --> 11:01.661
And you want me to give you
a discount to 3%?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.164
Justin--
Justin, I'm out.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.499
I have a feeling
you're not gonna get a deal. Okay.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.101
I'm out, too, Justin.
I think--

11:11.104 --> 11:13.072
Would you do it for 7%?
No.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.375
I think we're all out, right?

11:15.475 --> 11:16.643
We're all out.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.444
7%?
We're out.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.614
Justin, I hate to say it,
but I've got a feeling

11:21.714 --> 11:24.117
that one day you're going to
regret this moment.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.856
He still has a chance
to say yes.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.958
Here it is.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.328
$300,000 in equity
for 10%.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.530
I'll put up a line of credit
of $700,000.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.799
We'll do a market rate
interest, right?

11:39.899 --> 11:41.501
But it's
first dollar in,

11:41.601 --> 11:44.003
meaning I get paid the minute
you get paid by your customer.

11:45.972 --> 11:46.873
And you're in it?

11:46.973 --> 11:49.242
And I'm in it.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.311
Yes or no?

11:53.513 --> 11:55.248
Let's do it.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.050
There you go.
Whoa!

11:57.150 --> 11:58.651
Good job, guys.
You lucky...

11:58.751 --> 11:59.986
Wow.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.621
It's gonna be the best deal
you ever did.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.989
Thanks, man.
Congrats, man.
I'm proud of you.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.123
You've done
an amazing deal. Thanks.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.825
Uh-huh.
Well done
for not walking away.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.093
Thanks.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.161
I knew there was a reason

12:08.261 --> 12:09.429
I didn't like guys
that wore this shirt.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.663
But congratulation--

12:10.763 --> 12:12.031
No. Congratulations. Congrats.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.499
I'm glad you were able
to start listening.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.168
Thank you so much.
This was great.
Good luck.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.271
Whoo!

12:18.371 --> 12:20.106
He reminded me of me.
I'm not gonna lie.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.342
Because when you're young, you
don't know what you
<i>don't</i>
know.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.043
I did a lot more talking
than listening.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.379
It's gonna be interesting to
see how he works with us, though.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.981
We'll find out. Yeah.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.485
It means a ton that Mark Cuban
and Peter Jones are mentors now.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.087
I mean, having
them in my corner

12:34.187 --> 12:37.156
is just going to
kind of free me up to--

12:37.257 --> 12:40.126
to think bigger
than I ever thought before.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.395
And hopefully one day
I'll be sitting next to them

12:42.495 --> 12:44.364
in one of the Shark chairs.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.600
In Season 13,

12:47.700 --> 12:49.369
Sarah Moret made a deal
with Barbara Corcoran

12:49.469 --> 12:52.038
for her clean deodorant
company, Curie.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.707
$300,000 for 10%
and 4% adviser shares.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.310
Let's see what she's up to now.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.813
The night our episode aired,
we sold out completely.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.349
We had a 15,000-person
wait list.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.120
Once we restocked,
we sold out again and again.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.988
We partnered with
a new manufacturer.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.524
We also found
a new distribution center.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.660
Now we have two warehouses

13:13.760 --> 13:16.562
that help us get our products
to our customers faster.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.299
So, Sarah, let's get together
with your story.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.968
Barbara has been very hands-on
with the company.

13:22.068 --> 13:26.005
We've done webinars together,
Instagram giveaways, TikToks.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.708
Barbara is just always there
when you need her.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.276
Before going on "Shark Tank,"

13:30.376 --> 13:32.445
Curie was never
a profitable business.

13:32.545 --> 13:37.717
Now we're profitable, and
we've done over $1.6 million
in sales.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.653
We worked for over a year
developing our formula.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.056
We've also appeared on QVC
three times.

13:43.156 --> 13:48.361
My first airing, I sold
almost $140,000 in 16 minutes.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.030
We launched a worldwide
partnership with Equinox.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.099
They have over 100 clubs.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.168
Curie's deodorant spray
is available

13:55.268 --> 13:56.736
in every single one of them.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.072
Next year, we're planning
to focus on expanding

13:59.172 --> 14:02.508
our retail presence
and taking over the world.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.378
I believe your growth
is gonna explode.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.147
What makes Sarah
such a great entrepreneur

14:08.247 --> 14:09.482
is she is brave at heart.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.185
You have to remember
that she quit a well-paying
job

14:12.285 --> 14:13.653
and started this
little business

14:13.753 --> 14:15.988
just on her belief
that she could make a go of it.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.358
It's amazing when you put
your mind to something

14:18.458 --> 14:20.026
what an entrepreneur can do.

14:20.126 --> 14:24.297
Every single step
in my career has been a fight

14:24.397 --> 14:25.598
to get a seat at the table.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.933
I worked in venture capital,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.469
where 9% of venture
capitalists are women.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.705
I knew if I wanted a seat
at that table, I had to take it.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.942
My hope is that my story
inspires others.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.176
For any women out there

14:37.276 --> 14:39.112
questioning if their idea
is good enough,

14:39.212 --> 14:40.680
there's only one way
to find out.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.549
Don't wait for things to
happen. Make it happen.

14:43.649 --> 14:46.686
You have the power
to make your dreams come true.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.199
Next into the Tank

15:00.299 --> 15:03.903
is a better design
of a party staple.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.647
What's up, Sharks?
I'm Tim Loucks.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.016
I'm here today
seeking $300,000

15:17.116 --> 15:19.719
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.955
So, drinks on tap
are becoming more popular now

15:23.055 --> 15:24.724
than they've ever been before.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.994
People are absolutely loving
the at-home draft experience.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.564
But the problem is most kegs
and draft systems are big,

15:31.664 --> 15:33.800
expensive, and not portable.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.835
There's no way I'm gonna take
this thing on a boat,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.136
on a golf cart--

15:37.236 --> 15:40.540
Heck, I probably can't even
fit it in the fridge.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.312
There's no way
that's happening.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.315
Kegs had problems--
until now.

15:50.383 --> 15:55.421
Meet SquareOne, the world's
most efficient mini keg ever.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.692
SquareOne has the ultimate
cool factor.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.728
By providing more volume
in less space,

16:02.829 --> 16:04.397
it lets you bring
not just beer,

16:04.497 --> 16:07.133
but your favorite drink on tap
just about anywhere.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.769
Sharks, sitting in front of
you is your very own SquareOne.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.571
I've filled it
with a tasty beverage.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.139
Wah!

16:13.239 --> 16:15.775
Pour yourself a glass,
and let's get down to business.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.176
Wow!
All right.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.945
I like you,
and I don't even know you.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.716
So, Peter, Mark, and Daymond,
you guys have beer.

16:23.816 --> 16:28.020
Mr. Wonderful, you have
a vodka nitro espresso martini.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.723
O'Leary: Oh, damn.
And, Lori,
yours is a John Daly.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.360
So it's the alcoholic vodka
version of an Arnold Palmer.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.728
Wait. We need to do a toast.
To the...

16:35.828 --> 16:38.498
...Chevaliers du Tastevin!

16:38.598 --> 16:39.932
Yay!

16:40.032 --> 16:41.534
What do you think of that one,
Mr. Wonderful?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.436
Pretty good, actually.
This is really good.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.938
So, this is CO2
in this cartridge?

16:46.038 --> 16:48.808
So, yours is the only one
that's actually running on nitrogen.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.576
So, that's a new
product release.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.645
I always thought
that draft beer,

16:52.745 --> 16:54.981
there-- there was something
fresher about that.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.316
Sure.
But if you're putting
mixed drinks in there,

16:57.416 --> 16:58.885
what's the value
in that?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.186
Sure.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.288
So, the value, like in
the home space is, for instance,

17:02.388 --> 17:05.591
like when we go out on the
boat or we're doing things outdoors,

17:05.691 --> 17:07.627
we can batch a whole gallon
of cocktails

17:07.727 --> 17:09.829
that we're gonna take with us,
like margaritas.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.297
Super simple to bring with us.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.665
Then anybody
can serve themselves.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.635
You make this like
a little draft pour

17:15.735 --> 17:16.802
of any kind of drink.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.671
But wine.
You don't do wine in this.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.206
You could do wine
in this, right?

17:20.306 --> 17:22.775
So, we actually have
a wine product in the hopper

17:22.875 --> 17:25.111
that'll run on argon
with a different wine spout.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.379
We're not quite there yet,

17:26.479 --> 17:27.813
but that's kind of
our third product.
Got it.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.749
Tell us how the whole--
all the pieces fit together.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.218
So, basically SquareOne,
it's 128 ounces,

17:32.318 --> 17:35.588
so it holds either two
growlers' worth of beer, eight pints.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.423
So that's a 12-pack, almost.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.958
Yep.
Just about a 12-pack.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.494
Basically, you would fill it
with your beverage of choice,

17:41.594 --> 17:44.463
whether it's a cocktail or
beer, and then assemble the tap,

17:44.564 --> 17:45.865
and then you pressurize it.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.266
So it runs on CO2
or nitrogen cartridge.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.701
And then it's good
until it's finished.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.670
Correct.
Tell me how to disassemble it

17:50.770 --> 17:52.471
so I can go
put in another drink. Sure.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.273
Sure. So basically,
everything's threaded.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.576
It's got a pressure-release
valve on this side.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.244
So before you do
any disassembly,

17:58.344 --> 17:59.478
you would pull the pressure.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.713
So right here?
Yeah.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.915
But you want to turn
the valve off to the left.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.750
Right.
You sure you want to
be doing that, Mark?

18:04.850 --> 18:05.785
Daymond, where are you going?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.187
You're gonna blow
your head off.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.555
Turn this thing, pull this out.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.923
There's a little
pressurized thing on there.

18:11.023 --> 18:11.924
Do this. Yep.

18:12.024 --> 18:12.758
Oh!

18:14.827 --> 18:16.495
I was--
I was trying to help you.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.030
I knew
that was gonna happen!

18:18.130 --> 18:19.432
You know,
you said it was safe enough,

18:19.532 --> 18:20.733
so I just figured...
Oh, wow!

18:20.833 --> 18:23.903
Meanwhile, while
he's blowing himself up, Tim...

18:24.003 --> 18:26.672
Tim, you must have--
We're gonna get--

18:26.772 --> 18:29.742
'Cause obviously $3 million
is quite a big valuation.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.777
You must have good sales
so far.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.813
So, we've sold
over 4,000 units.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.048
Right now, lifetime sales
are over $1.4 million.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.416
Wow!
Okay.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.652
Over what period of time?
Last 12 months?

18:39.752 --> 18:40.853
Over a year.
Yeah?
Wow.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.555
And what have you made
out of that, Tim?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.724
So, we lost about $250,000
last year.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.858
Ooh.
Um...
Ugh.
That's okay.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.494
This year, we're on track
to make a 15% net.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.496
Okay.
This is gonna be our first
profitable in the month,

18:50.596 --> 18:52.331
and we're on track to do over
200 grand this month in sales.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.599
Damn. Nice.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.867
And how much are they?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.469
Uh, so, that one
right there in front of you

18:56.569 --> 18:58.204
retails for $259.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.805
That's not bad.
And what does it cost?

18:59.905 --> 19:01.307
It costs us $130.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.442
We make them
in Washington state.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.412
Last May, we set up
our own manufacturing facility

19:06.512 --> 19:08.848
where we started adding
and refining our processes

19:08.948 --> 19:11.851
so we could get the costs down
to where we could be profitable.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.621
So, I'm buying these things
as a consumer for my home.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.590
Correct.
This is not for a business.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.991
But it could be, right?

19:19.091 --> 19:20.259
Yes.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.595
So, we focused 100%
direct-to-consumer on this.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.598
Really, the vision was
in the commercial market.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.633
When COVID hit, we're like,
"Okay.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.201
We're spending a lot of money developing

19:29.301 --> 19:31.103
and creating these products,
but we got to start

19:31.203 --> 19:32.805
bringing some money
back through the door."

19:32.905 --> 19:34.607
And, Tim, how did you come up
with this, then?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.342
What made you think
of this?
Sure.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.444
So, I've always been
an idea guy.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.079
Never really took action
on any. Okay.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.781
But it was November 2017.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.749
I woke up in the middle
of the night, like--

19:43.849 --> 19:45.951
And for some crazy reason
I was thinking about

19:46.052 --> 19:47.620
the inefficiencies
of round kegs.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.755
And I'm like,
"Everywhere they're stored,

19:49.855 --> 19:52.625
everywhere they're
transported, everywhere
they're refrigerated

19:52.725 --> 19:55.027
are square,
rectangular spaces."

19:55.127 --> 19:57.496
I just thought it would be
a huge value... Okay.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.098
But, Tim, as us--

19:59.198 --> 20:01.400
as all of us being
potential partners,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.369
how often you wake up
at 2:30 in the morning

20:03.469 --> 20:05.705
thinking about a more
efficient way to get hammered?

20:07.473 --> 20:08.841
Never.
But I guess I was lucky.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.076
Yeah, right?

20:10.176 --> 20:13.079
Tim, so, it is very,
very cool.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.981
But I don't really comprehend
the value of it

20:16.082 --> 20:18.417
because I'm just--
I'm not a tap drinker,

20:18.517 --> 20:21.320
so I'm a little stuck there.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.889
I just-- I don't think
I-I get it as much.

20:23.989 --> 20:24.957
Sure.
So I'm out.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.592
Thank you.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.260
So, Tim, I have
an important question,

20:28.360 --> 20:29.729
because I'm in
the wine industry.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.431
You know, there's a lot
of delivery systems for--

20:32.531 --> 20:34.467
that actually try and keep
wine from spoiling

20:34.567 --> 20:36.335
after you've had a little bit
of a bottle.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.903
We put argon
or nitrogen gas in it.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.239
Is the one you're making
for wine--

20:40.339 --> 20:43.175
Could I put three bottles
of chardonnay in here

20:43.275 --> 20:46.579
and then would the system--
I'm asking if this is a plan--

20:46.679 --> 20:48.614
You're gonna use argon gas
to seal that surface

20:48.714 --> 20:50.382
from any oxygen
hitting it. Correct.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.751
So for the next
two weeks,

20:51.851 --> 20:53.853
I could be pulling out
a glass of chardonnay?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.821
Yes, 100%.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.124
Well, that is
a [bleep] cool idea.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.794
Tim, it's cool.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.597
Listen.
It did pique my interest.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.065
Now, I'm a wine drinker, right?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.733
What would be
really cool is--

21:07.833 --> 21:09.802
is if you get that one
figured out,

21:09.902 --> 21:11.837
I hope you'll come back
in the Tank with that.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.506
Sure.
You don't have it
right now,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.775
so I think you're
onto something.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.543
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.044
Thanks, Lori.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.380
Tim, I-I can't see

21:21.480 --> 21:24.150
how I could help you turn this
into a great business.

21:24.250 --> 21:28.320
I think it's a really neat
invention, but I just can't--

21:28.420 --> 21:29.688
I can't scale this
with you.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.490
So for that reason,
I'm out.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.325
Thank you, Peter.
Yeah. Tim, I love the product.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.194
I really, really do.
Obviously, I'm clumsy with it.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.096
I'm not good with mechanics
at all.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.265
I see the value
for it.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.534
I'll definitely try to buy
some, because I think--

21:41.634 --> 21:42.701
I think you have
a hit.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.270
I just don't know
where I would fit with it.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.404
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.940
Thanks, Mark.
You're welcome.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.042
Everybody out?
Yep.
Yes.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.477
Okay.
So, I'm intrigued.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.878
Okay.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.613
When is the wine product
coming?

21:54.713 --> 21:56.615
In less than three months.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.717
Why didn't you say that
to me?

21:58.818 --> 22:02.154
I-I guess I just didn't say it.

22:03.889 --> 22:09.295
So, I'm really intrigued with
the white wine in the fridge

22:09.395 --> 22:11.931
and the red wine sitting out
on the bar

22:12.031 --> 22:13.833
with the argon
or nitrogen gas.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.201
That's a very cool idea.

22:15.301 --> 22:18.237
The industry has been trying
to solve for that for 20 years.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.372
Absolutely.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.842
All right.
I'll give you the 300K.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.744
I want 20%.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.414
I'll tell you why.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.150
I mean, you need someone like
me to help you blow this up online,

22:31.250 --> 22:35.154
because, really, you want to
sell it direct to consumers.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.922
So, what do you think, Tim?
What do you want to do?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.090
No.
I think it's great.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.325
I-I honestly--

22:39.425 --> 22:41.727
I know Mr. Wonderful has
great senses in this space

22:41.827 --> 22:42.962
when it comes to beverage.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.564
Would you consider doing
the $300,000 for 15%

22:45.664 --> 22:47.166
and meet me in the middle?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.269
No.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.372
It-- It's a simple product.
I like what you've done.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.441
I mean, other than Mark
blowing himself up.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.411
But, um, it's gonna be work
for me.

22:59.511 --> 23:03.182
I get behind this, we'll make
a lot of money together.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.484
It-- It looks beautiful.
It fits in the fridge.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.152
And I'm gonna take a flier
on it.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.654
I want 20%.

23:11.757 --> 23:12.758
Let's do it.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.360
Yeah!

23:14.460 --> 23:15.494
Smart, Tim. Well done.
Good luck.

23:15.594 --> 23:16.528
Smart.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.696
It's beautiful.
Kevin, thank you.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.031
You did a great job on this.
Thank you.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.132
Congrats, Tim. Congrats.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.467
Congrats, Tim.
Thank you, guys.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.402
Appreciate you.
Well done, Tim. Fantastic.

23:23.502 --> 23:24.803
Thanks, man.
We'll blow it up.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.338
Thanks, Kevin.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.707
I like that deal.
Kevin-- Yeah.

23:28.807 --> 23:29.708
I like that deal, Kev.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.176
I think it's
a great deal.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.478
SquareKeg's been my life

23:32.578 --> 23:35.147
on the side from my day job
for five years.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.182
It's been a complete grind,
but it's enabled me

23:37.283 --> 23:39.985
to leave the corporate
handcuffs behind once and for all.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.887
And now that I'm working
with Mr. Wonderful,

23:41.987 --> 23:44.256
I'm super confident we're
gonna take this thing to the moon.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.770
Next up is an adorable solution

23:57.870 --> 24:00.606
to prolong the life
of a favorite snack.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.982
Hey, Sharks.
My name is Sean Adler.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.318
I'm seeking an investment
of $150,000

24:12.418 --> 24:15.220
in exchange for 10%
of my company.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.555
We've all been there.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.924
You come home from the grocery
store with fresh bananas,

24:19.024 --> 24:21.026
having every intention of
eating the whole bunch.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.861
But let's be honest
with ourselves.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.097
Some of those happy
yellow bananas

24:25.197 --> 24:29.201
are gonna turn brown, sad,
and end up in the trash.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.769
Yuck.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.706
You see,
as bananas begin to ripen,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.607
they release ethylene gas,

24:35.708 --> 24:38.477
a natural ripening agent found
in fruits and vegetables.

24:38.577 --> 24:42.214
Ethylene gas hates
yellow bananas.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.584
So we have to slow
this absorption at the crown.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.587
And that's where my company,
Nana Hats, comes in...

24:50.956 --> 24:53.826
...the world's first
banana-preservation device

24:53.926 --> 24:57.096
specifically designed to be
functional, reduce food waste,

24:57.196 --> 25:00.032
and look super adorable
on your kitchen countertop.

25:00.132 --> 25:03.936
Each of our silicone caps
comes retrofitted with a magnet

25:04.036 --> 25:05.270
that's meant to be used
with any one

25:05.371 --> 25:07.906
of our 12
interchangeable hats.

25:08.007 --> 25:11.777
So, which one of you Sharks
wants to join me, the Nana King,

25:11.877 --> 25:14.947
as I set out to put a hat on
all the bananas across the
world?

25:16.648 --> 25:19.485
Is it through the top
you're saying,

25:19.585 --> 25:22.121
that causes
the ripening?

25:22.221 --> 25:23.322
So if you cover it,

25:23.422 --> 25:25.657
then the ethylene gas
is not emitted?

25:25.758 --> 25:26.925
No, it's still--
it's still emitted,

25:27.026 --> 25:29.161
but you're basically slowing
the-- the spread

25:29.261 --> 25:31.463
of the ethylene gas
to the other bananas.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.965
How long
does it extend it for?

25:33.065 --> 25:36.368
So, we make no specific claims
as to how many days we can get,

25:36.468 --> 25:38.670
because each-- each-- every
set of bananas is different.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.573
But a ballpark would be eight
to twelve days.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.042
Okay.
Well, that's of value.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.744
And is that why when sometimes
I buy bananas from the store,

25:45.844 --> 25:48.447
there's, like, the green, um,
plastic wrap

25:48.547 --> 25:50.516
around the top of them--
'cause the store

25:50.616 --> 25:52.785
is trying to preserve it
for a little bit longer?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.686
Yes. Exactly.
It's the same methodology.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.954
And, you know--
I learn--

25:56.055 --> 25:58.323
I learn new things
every day.

25:58.424 --> 26:01.126
What do you sell it for and
what does it cost you to make?

26:01.226 --> 26:04.530
We sell it in two-packs
for $12.99.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.632
The average cost of our hat,

26:06.732 --> 26:08.834
with the standard-size
silicone and the packaging,

26:08.934 --> 26:10.335
um, is $1.95.

26:10.436 --> 26:14.506
So just the--
the little silicone sock

26:14.606 --> 26:16.842
without the magnet would be
significantly cheaper, right?

26:16.942 --> 26:18.110
It's correct.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.579
So why couldn't you put
a little smiley face on the sock

26:20.679 --> 26:22.381
and call it a day
instead of having this?

26:22.481 --> 26:24.583
Yeah. I mean, you don't want
to look at a little sock

26:24.683 --> 26:25.684
on your bananas.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.420
No offense, Kevin.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.289
Sean-- Sean, th--

26:30.389 --> 26:31.523
What made you come up
with this?

26:31.623 --> 26:32.758
Why Nana Hats?

26:32.858 --> 26:34.660
You know, I got the idea
back in 2016.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.795
I was just coming home
from the grocery store,

26:36.895 --> 26:38.931
just thinking of ways
to keep my bananas fresh.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.699
So I--

26:40.799 --> 26:42.835
You know? I'm telling you.
It's what...

26:42.935 --> 26:45.838
You know, and I went online,
and I saw lots of methods.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.107
Like, everything from duct
tape to tinfoil.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.910
And I had inconsistent
results, and plus all those methods

26:52.010 --> 26:54.480
add to the single-use-plastics
problem in the country, so--

26:54.580 --> 26:55.814
What's your job?
What-- You must--

26:55.914 --> 26:57.149
I work now as a wealth manager

26:57.249 --> 26:59.318
for one of the country's
largest investment banks.

27:00.719 --> 27:01.620
Do you?
Yeah.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.289
I thought of this
in 2016.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.258
I said, "I'm gonna work on
this when I have more time."

27:06.358 --> 27:08.694
You know, basically 2020
came around, the world stopped.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.596
All of a sudden, I had
a lot more time on my hands.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.131
I'm learning to work from home remotely.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.700
I assembled
the first 15,000 units

27:14.800 --> 27:15.801
and launched the company

27:15.901 --> 27:17.536
all from the comfort
of my living-room couch.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.371
What's happened since?

27:19.471 --> 27:23.408
2021, for the full year,
we did a $483,000.

27:23.509 --> 27:24.610
Oh!
Hello!

27:24.710 --> 27:25.944
Get out of here.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.347
Bananas to the moon, baby!

27:28.447 --> 27:29.581
You're taking me seriously now.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.183
O'Leary: Okay. Wait, wait,
wait. So that was last year.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.618
What's gonna happen
this year?

27:32.718 --> 27:34.586
We're projecting
to do $600,000 this year.

27:34.686 --> 27:37.055
And on the $600,000
we're gonna make $240,000.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.757
Wow.
Excellent!

27:38.857 --> 27:42.027
What's the breakdown
of the sales from retail

27:42.127 --> 27:43.962
to direct-to-customer?

27:44.062 --> 27:46.798
Yeah.
So 60% of our business is D2C.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.734
The other 40% is wholesale.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.602
Where are they putting these
in retail?

27:50.702 --> 27:53.438
We have a few mini novelty
gift shops around the country,

27:53.539 --> 27:56.375
but 99% of our wholesale sales

27:56.475 --> 27:59.111
are through one
large online gift retailer.

27:59.211 --> 28:02.147
Have you tried to talk
to any of the grocery chains,

28:02.247 --> 28:06.652
like Kroger or any of them
to see if they were
interested?

28:06.752 --> 28:08.086
Yeah.
I've hammered the pavement.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.088
I've been making lots of calls
and e-mails.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.990
And, you know,
this is a brand-new product--

28:12.090 --> 28:13.358
Sean, look.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.395
I'm not gonna invest.
It's just not a fit for me.

28:16.495 --> 28:17.863
But I have to
tell you this.

28:17.963 --> 28:21.667
Every single person who
watched this show has at some time

28:21.767 --> 28:25.037
come up with what everybody
told them was a crazy idea.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.439
But you didn't listen,

28:27.539 --> 28:31.310
and you went from what is
obviously an insane idea,

28:31.410 --> 28:36.148
turned it into a product,
sold $600,000 worth,

28:36.248 --> 28:41.620
and you were going to put
$240,000 in your bank account

28:41.720 --> 28:45.791
because you were smart enough
and driven and focused enough

28:45.891 --> 28:47.826
to follow through
with your crazy idea

28:47.926 --> 28:49.494
of putting hats
on bananas.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.396
So congratulations.
Thank you.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.166
You know?
So congrats.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.667
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.937
Sean, um, I just don't think
it's a big enough business

28:59.037 --> 29:00.739
where you need a partner, though.
Before you go out--

29:00.839 --> 29:02.874
You know, let's first talk
about the IP.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.877
We have a pending utility
patent for a sealed cavity

29:05.978 --> 29:07.446
around the crown
of the bananas--

29:07.546 --> 29:09.181
so a banana
- preservation device.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.316
Good for you.
Good for you.
Are there a lot
of banana-preservation

29:11.416 --> 29:12.818
No.
We'll be first.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.387
I get it.
Is there a Banana
Preservation Society?

29:16.922 --> 29:18.557
Only in London.
If there is, I'm gonna--

29:18.657 --> 29:20.859
We can join it together.
All right.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.094
So listen.
It's there.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.962
You don't need a partner
for this.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.097
I'm out.
Thank you, man.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.199
Sean, have you got
a full-time job still?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.101
I do.
So who's running
the business?

29:29.201 --> 29:32.437
You're looking at, uh, the
sole employee of the business.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.439
And you own it 100%?
100%.

29:34.539 --> 29:37.509
My wife helps me a lot,
and I'm a brand-new father...

29:37.609 --> 29:39.278
Congrats.
...in the last three weeks.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.179
Her name's Gia.
Aww!

29:41.280 --> 29:43.415
In the banana outfit.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.684
Wait.
Sean, do you know what?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.552
I've been around
for a long time, and I've seen

29:47.653 --> 29:49.588
some things where we can laugh
and have a bit of fun.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.990
But sometimes these things
go crazy.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.059
I really like this product,
and I also think

29:54.159 --> 29:56.328
it could be one of those
products in the Shark Tank

29:56.428 --> 29:58.063
that could be
really successful.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.299
And it's gonna take
quite a lot of work

30:00.399 --> 30:01.733
to make a lot of money.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.135
I'm not gonna make it easy
for you, though,

30:03.235 --> 30:06.204
'cause I'm only gonna offer
you half of the money.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.907
Oh.
So you're gonna have to get
another Shark on board.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.522
Two Sharks are out.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.825
Peter is interested in Sean's
banana-preservation product,

30:26.925 --> 30:28.126
Nana Hats,

30:28.226 --> 30:31.496
but he wants to split the deal
with another Shark.

30:31.596 --> 30:34.066
I'm not gonna
make it easy for you, though,

30:34.166 --> 30:36.635
'cause I'm only gonna offer
you half of the money.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.638
Oh.
So you're gonna have to get
another Shark on board.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.341
I'd do the other half.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.444
You know,
Peter's from the U. K.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.379
I'm U. S. A.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.948
I go in with you,
and then I think

30:50.048 --> 30:52.818
that we would be covering
two continents, right?

30:52.918 --> 30:54.986
Be globally bananas. Right.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.656
Global brand
for Nana Hats.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.292
What do you say?
A percentage?
What percentage
are you asking for?

31:00.392 --> 31:03.628
I would offer you
half of the money for 15%.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.164
And I would take 15%.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.366
Ooh.
Then, we--

31:07.466 --> 31:09.468
O'Leary: Well,
there's another Shark here.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.303
Well, now you're getting
two Sharks.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.905
I smell a royalty deal coming.
You're getting international
and national.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.707
Hold on. Hold on.
So you have to
give up 30%.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.676
That's very, very,
very aggressive.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.444
And you haven't heard from
the fruit fly yet.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.480
O'Leary: Yeah. No, no.
I would do this deal for 10%.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.048
However--
because Mark brought it up.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.616
I wasn't even thinking royalty
at the beginning.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.817
Yes, you were.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.520
But I'd like a dollar
a unit.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.222
Aw, Kevin.
Which actually is not horrible

31:30.322 --> 31:31.456
for 10% versus 30%.
Wow!

31:31.556 --> 31:32.791
It <i>is</i> horrible. Wow.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.259
O'Leary:
There's another way to go here.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.595
We could throw Lori under the
bus 'cause we don't need her,

31:36.695 --> 31:38.864
and Peter and I
can get together.

31:38.964 --> 31:40.732
Then you get banana loco. Oh.
Peter is a man of honor.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.501
No, no.
She slipped on a banana peel.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.769
No problem.

31:43.869 --> 31:46.772
What you didn't know
is that the Queen awarded him

31:46.872 --> 31:48.774
Commander of the
British Empire.
Commander Jones.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.509
And a man who is Commander
of the British Empire

31:50.609 --> 31:51.977
would never throw a woman
under the bus.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.346
Yes, he would!
In two seconds.
No, he would not.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.548
Do you want a partner
like that?
Sean, I'm too much of a gent
to throw Lori under the bus.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.883
A partner that would throw me
under the bus.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.084
Would you like a partner
like that?
So the deal--

31:59.184 --> 32:00.752
the deal with Lori and I
is your dream ticket.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.053
Take it.
That's right.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.055
No. You're paying
way too much equity.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.057
You can counter also, Sean.
Ask him-- Ask him

32:06.158 --> 32:08.660
how he's going to, like,
pound the pavement.
I'm gonna counter.

32:09.661 --> 32:13.899
Would you consider 15%
for $150,000?

32:13.999 --> 32:16.234
What, half?
Peter,
would you go to 20%?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.771
I-I would do it
for 20%.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.273
20%?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.874
20%, $150,000.
$150,000.

32:22.974 --> 32:24.643
The two of us.
At 20%,
you get both of us.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.346
You guys, you have a deal.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.515
Whoo!
You guys are bananas.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.584
God. Wow.
You're really that tall.

32:32.684 --> 32:33.718
He <i>is</i> tall.

32:33.819 --> 32:36.655
I thought I was the tallest
guy in the room.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.190
Thanks for that.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.691
Congrats, Sean.
Well done.

32:41.927 --> 32:43.395
You know, they were laughing
at first,

32:43.495 --> 32:45.163
but, you know,
once I hit them with the sales

32:45.263 --> 32:47.599
and, you know,
my vision for the future,

32:47.699 --> 32:48.867
they seemed to be on board.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.869
So I couldn't be happier
to have, you know,

32:50.969 --> 32:52.137
Lori and Peter as partners.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.239
And I really think
we're gonna make Nana Hats

32:54.339 --> 32:55.407
a household name.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.076
Okay, Lori.
Walk over here.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.611
Yeah.
T--

33:01.713 --> 33:05.851
You are evil and nasty!

33:16.061 --> 33:17.629
Next into the Tank

33:17.729 --> 33:21.132
is a couple seeking to disrupt
a vintage industry.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.643
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Whitney Gates.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.144
And I'm Chaz Gates. Together...

33:33.245 --> 33:34.579
We're the United Gates!
...we're the United Gates,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.314
reigning from Dallas, Texas.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.816
What?!

33:37.916 --> 33:41.186
And we're seeking $185,000

33:41.286 --> 33:44.389
for an 8% stake
in our emerging wine empire.

33:44.489 --> 33:48.760
Tired of boring wines
that leave you without a buzz?

33:51.830 --> 33:53.565
Crave handcrafted cocktails,

33:53.665 --> 33:56.268
but hate the time and work
they take to make?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.736
What <i>is</i> all this?

33:57.836 --> 33:59.971
Want the convenience
of ready-to-drink options

34:00.071 --> 34:02.474
without all
the fake ingredients?

34:02.574 --> 34:04.809
Artificial flavors?
Artificial colors?

34:04.910 --> 34:07.078
What the...
Chaz! Chaz!
Language!

34:07.178 --> 34:08.747
We're on "Shark Tank."

34:08.847 --> 34:11.249
Well, Sharks,
do we have the solution for you.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.218
Drumroll, please.
Drumroll, please.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.720
Introducing Wondry!
Introducing Wondry!

34:15.820 --> 34:18.390
An international, award
- winning collection of wines

34:18.490 --> 34:20.292
infused with organic
fruit extracts

34:20.392 --> 34:21.826
and crafted
with a kick.

34:21.927 --> 34:25.864
Of 13.9% alcohol
by volume!

34:25.964 --> 34:27.399
Wondry wines
blur the lines

34:27.499 --> 34:29.501
between a premium wine
and craft cocktail,

34:29.601 --> 34:32.003
delivering a heightened
alcohol experience

34:32.103 --> 34:33.572
with a juicy,
smooth finish.

34:33.672 --> 34:37.008
Most importantly, our wines
are fruit-forward, aromatic,

34:37.108 --> 34:39.277
beautifully balanced,
and absolutely delicious.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.113
Aged in small batches
through our proprietary

34:42.213 --> 34:44.349
fermentation
and infusion process,

34:44.449 --> 34:46.585
our wines are
tastefully crafted for...

34:46.685 --> 34:48.086
...any occasion.

34:48.186 --> 34:51.356
Sharks, we reject exclusivity
within the wine industry.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.959
So whether you're a first-time
sipper or a sommelier,

34:54.059 --> 34:55.560
at Wondry,
all winos are welcome.

34:55.660 --> 34:59.965
As a part of the less than 1%
of American winemakers

35:00.065 --> 35:01.166
who are Black,

35:01.266 --> 35:03.501
we are disrupting
conventional wine thinking

35:03.602 --> 35:05.270
and reimagining
the wine experience

35:05.370 --> 35:07.038
for those
with nontraditional tastes.

35:07.138 --> 35:10.241
So, Sharks, are you ready
to shatter glass ceilings

35:10.342 --> 35:12.677
by filling glass bottles
with Wondry?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.779
Shall we toast?

35:14.879 --> 35:15.981
To Wondry!
To Wondry!

35:16.081 --> 35:17.616
Let's sip different!
Let's sip different!

35:17.716 --> 35:21.319
So, Sharks, in front of you,
as we mentioned,

35:21.419 --> 35:23.188
is our collection of wines.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.056
You have
Sangria Especial...

35:25.156 --> 35:28.893
Ooh.
...which is our top-selling
varietal year-round.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.463
You also have
Cran Apple en Blanc,

35:31.563 --> 35:34.733
which is our top-selling wine
during the holiday season.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.401
It sells like hotcakes.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.470
You also have
our newest introduction,

35:38.570 --> 35:40.872
our Southern Country
Cocktail Cream.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.741
If you're familiar
with cream liqueurs,

35:42.841 --> 35:44.576
this is
our unique spin.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.611
You have two signature
Wondry cocktails--

35:46.711 --> 35:49.648
our Watermelon Rosé
with a simple mixer--
lemonade.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.616
That tastes amazing,
that Watermelon Rosé.
You like that?

35:51.716 --> 35:53.551
Thank you. Yeah.
Ah. Thank you so much.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.586
I like the apple.
Apple good.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.787
Do you like that? Yeah!

35:55.887 --> 35:56.888
Apple good.
Yeah!

35:56.988 --> 35:58.690
We feel like our wines
are differentiated,

35:58.790 --> 36:02.527
because if you look at a
semisweet wine of this caliber,

36:02.627 --> 36:05.563
they're generally around 5%
to 7% alcohol by volume.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.099
Oh. Okay.
So we are double

36:08.199 --> 36:09.601
that of what you would see...
Big difference.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.836
...in an average semisweet
wine of this type.

36:11.936 --> 36:16.608
97% of wine sold in America is
sold for under $14.99 a bottle.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.909
Yes.
So I'm hoping

36:18.009 --> 36:19.611
you're gonna tell us
you're under that price point.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.247
So, we're actually
slightly above that price point.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.815
But there's a reason
for that.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.685
We use only
the most premium, organic,

36:26.785 --> 36:29.487
and all-natural ingredients
with our wines.

36:29.587 --> 36:33.024
Our price point is $18.99
suggested retail.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.959
At that price point,
are you doing direct-to-
consumer

36:35.060 --> 36:36.227
or are you going
through retail?

36:36.327 --> 36:37.395
We're doing both.

36:37.495 --> 36:38.863
We have our
distribution strategy

36:38.963 --> 36:40.598
that we're currently
leveraging in Texas.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.867
So we're currently selling
in two big-box retailers

36:42.967 --> 36:44.402
in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.

36:44.502 --> 36:45.704
Which ones?

36:45.804 --> 36:47.038
Target and Total Wine.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.240
I've tasted this, and I'm
about to get drunk, so--

36:49.340 --> 36:50.408
There we go!

36:50.508 --> 36:52.811
So, what does it cost
to manufacture?

36:52.911 --> 36:54.079
Absolutely.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.748
To manufacture one bottle
of our cocktail wines,

36:56.848 --> 36:59.350
it costs $3.61.

36:59.451 --> 37:04.189
We sell a bottle of our wines
for $13.30 to retailers.

37:04.289 --> 37:05.857
Very good.
Wow. It's good margin.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.358
And when did you start
the business?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.527
We started the business
in August of 2021.
August of last year.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.830
So we're right around
11 months.
Just shy of a year.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.965
11 months. And what's been
the sales in 11 months?

37:14.065 --> 37:17.168
In 11 months,
we've done $250,000 in sales.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.938
That's not bad.
And what was your profit
on that $250,000?

37:20.038 --> 37:24.075
So, on the $250,000,
we will do $60,000 in profit.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.945
We're at a 32%
operating margin.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.147
That's not bad either.
How much have <i>you</i> invested?

37:29.247 --> 37:30.381
$100,000 total,

37:30.482 --> 37:33.184
which we know is a barrier
to entry to a lot of people.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.019
Oh. So it's a big amount.
So we've been fortunate...

37:35.120 --> 37:36.087
...through savings

37:36.187 --> 37:37.155
in order to invest that
in the business.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.957
What's your previous history?

37:39.057 --> 37:40.291
Were you winemakers?
Were you--

37:40.391 --> 37:42.460
Interestingly enough,
I actually grew up

37:42.560 --> 37:45.930
watching my late paralyzed
uncle making wine out of his garage.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.266
I actually called it happy
juice at the time.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.969
Your uncle was a bootlegger?
Yes!

37:51.069 --> 37:52.437
Basically, yes.
He was!

37:52.537 --> 37:55.440
But his wines
really served as catalyst

37:55.540 --> 37:57.308
for community relaxation
and escape

37:57.408 --> 37:59.277
among our friends
and family members.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.913
So I wanted to re-create
those moments

38:02.013 --> 38:05.950
and just continue on this
great legacy that my uncle had set.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.453
I started teaching myself
how to make wine

38:08.553 --> 38:10.789
and then decided to start
taking collegiate courses

38:10.889 --> 38:12.524
at one of the nation's
top programs

38:12.624 --> 38:14.192
for viticulture
and enology.

38:14.292 --> 38:18.096
And you really have to have
that knowledge of how to craft wine

38:18.196 --> 38:21.432
and do it in a really
kind of premium way to succeed.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.168
Now, Chaz, what's your story?

38:23.268 --> 38:24.936
In all honesty,
when we were walking out,

38:25.036 --> 38:26.805
it hit me that I'm
not supposed to be here.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.306
My mom raised me
and my siblings.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.575
She had to work multiple jobs
just to ensure

38:30.675 --> 38:33.344
we had a warm meal and a--
and a nice roof over our head.

38:33.444 --> 38:35.446
That led me to go to college
in Arkansas,

38:35.547 --> 38:37.215
at the University of Arkansas,
Pine Bluff.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.517
Shortly after graduation,
I moved to D. C.

38:39.617 --> 38:42.487
I worked as a legislative aide
in Congress during the day.

38:42.587 --> 38:43.822
I went to Johns Hopkins
at night.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.356
I got my master's degree.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.158
I worked for two congressmen
from Arkansas.

38:47.258 --> 38:48.626
I moved to China.

38:48.726 --> 38:50.361
I taught at a university
in China for a couple of
years. Wow.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.864
You speak Chinese?

38:52.964 --> 38:56.067
I then went to law school
at American University in D
... C.,

38:56.167 --> 38:57.569
became a corporate lawyer,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.838
started to feel the tug
to move back home to Dallas.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.006
And since I moved back,
I've been in-house counsel

39:02.106 --> 39:04.542
for one of the world's
largest semiconductor companies

39:04.642 --> 39:05.877
and tech companies.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.011
So, Chaz, ultimately,

39:07.111 --> 39:08.646
you've underachieved
in your life, then.

39:08.746 --> 39:09.848
Exactly.
Yes.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.983
Have you started to talk
to the big box?

39:12.083 --> 39:14.519
The number-one retailer of
wine on Earth is Costco.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.020
Yes.
Have you talked to them?

39:16.120 --> 39:18.957
We have not yet talked
to Costco,

39:19.057 --> 39:21.426
but we've had
the great luck

39:21.526 --> 39:25.196
of being able to engage Target
and Total Wine

39:25.296 --> 39:27.332
within the first five months
of our business.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.067
How's your sell-through
in Target?

39:29.167 --> 39:30.802
We are the number-two

39:30.902 --> 39:33.438
Black-owned adult-beverage
brand nationwide.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.606
Nationwide.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.341
I don't know anything
about wine.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.909
I've never been a wine person.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.510
Sure.
I know you're gonna do well.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.079
I hope that somebody else
on the panel--

39:41.179 --> 39:43.248
probably the more-- the one
with more expertise here--

39:43.348 --> 39:45.416
does something with you,
but for that reason, I'm out.

39:45.516 --> 39:46.918
We understand.
And thank you, Daymond.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.687
Listen.
First off, like, so impressive.

39:49.787 --> 39:50.989
Your pedigrees?
Thank you so much.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.791
Wow. But I'm a person
who stays away from sugar.

39:53.892 --> 39:54.926
Sure.
Mm-hmm.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.561
And I like to invest
in things

39:56.661 --> 39:58.897
that I'm also going to drink
and use.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.131
Sure.
Sure.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.267
So I don't see it
as a good investment for me.

40:02.367 --> 40:05.136
So, um, for those reasons,
I'm out.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.404
Sure.

40:06.504 --> 40:09.407
I used to own a wines-direct
business in England,

40:09.507 --> 40:11.743
but I think that it's not
right for me.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.411
And I just want
to explain why,

40:13.511 --> 40:14.979
because it's not a reflection
of you.

40:15.079 --> 40:18.583
It was quite a tough journey
for me, even as an investor.

40:18.683 --> 40:22.420
So I'm gonna wish you all the
very best and say that I'm
out.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.355
What do you guys need?

40:24.455 --> 40:26.758
We're winemakers,
and so with the investment,

40:26.858 --> 40:28.393
we would invest that
into equipment.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.461
So an automatic bottling line,
which would help us

40:30.561 --> 40:32.297
be more efficient
in the winemaking process.

40:32.397 --> 40:33.765
So you own
all your own equipment,

40:33.865 --> 40:35.266
you do all your own bottling?

40:35.366 --> 40:36.267
All of it. Yes.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.802
We work hard
every single day.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.237
We're not sleeping
at night.

40:39.337 --> 40:42.774
We have a 9-month-old son
that we're taking care of.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.810
And so this is a lot of time
and effort that we've put in.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.679
But winemaking, yes.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.147
But it's something
that we're passionate about.

40:49.247 --> 40:50.748
It's part of her legacy,
and it's something that--

40:50.848 --> 40:52.216
Guys, look.
I love what you're doing.
Yeah. Thank you.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.686
Kevin, are you--
are you able to do something?

40:54.786 --> 40:57.355
Because I know you've got
your own wine.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.958
If I'm going to invest
a lot more time and resources

41:00.058 --> 41:01.926
into a wine business,
it's gonna be my own.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.227
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

41:03.328 --> 41:06.264
Okay. So you wanted $185,000
for 8%?

41:06.364 --> 41:07.598
8%, yes.
Yes, sir.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.068
I'll give you $200,000--
it's just an easier number--

41:10.168 --> 41:11.302
for 15%.

41:11.402 --> 41:12.971
That's an incredibly fair
offer, Mark.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.940
Can we ask you
for a little bit more money--

41:16.040 --> 41:18.209
$250,000 for 15%?

41:18.309 --> 41:21.713
$225,000 for 15%.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.748
Mark, you got a deal.
Welcome to our wino family!

41:23.848 --> 41:24.816
Welcome to Wondry.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.551
Yay!
Thank you so much!

41:26.651 --> 41:27.952
Gosh.
Thank you, Mark. Yay.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.988
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.256
Appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
You just made our dreams
come true.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.958
No. I'm excited,
'cause you guys are local.

41:34.058 --> 41:34.959
You guys are amazing.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.260
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

41:36.361 --> 41:37.662
This means so much. Yeah.
This is gonna be great.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.097
You just made our dream
come true.
Congratulations, guys.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.431
Cheers!
O'Leary: Cheers.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.066
Cheers.
Thanks!
Well done, guys.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.301
Whoo!
Whoo.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.470
Yeah, baby!
Yes. Yes.

41:45.570 --> 41:46.738
Love you.
Actually got a deal.

41:46.838 --> 41:47.739
We did it.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.540
Are the doors shut?
Oh, my gosh.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.642
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!

41:51.743 --> 41:54.078
Mark Cuban!
Let's go!
Yes. Whoo!

41:54.178 --> 41:57.048
We are living the American
dream right now.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.816
And to anyone
who's ever doubted,

41:58.916 --> 42:01.686
we can tell you all it takes
is a little sweat equity,

42:01.786 --> 42:03.254
a little commitment
to what you're doing,

42:03.354 --> 42:06.491
