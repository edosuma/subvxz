00:02.627 --> 00:03.961
BRANDON:
<i>That's exactly it.</i>

00:04.045 --> 00:06.756
I... I want to know how students

00:06.840 --> 00:08.090
are defining
themselves.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.217
I don't think that

00:09.300 --> 00:10.927
the old party labels
fit anymore.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.429
It's all about
whether you're voting

00:12.512 --> 00:14.931
{\an1}liberally or conservatively.
You're really

00:15.014 --> 00:15.974
{\an1}passionate about this
stuff, aren't you?

00:16.056 --> 00:17.058
You have to be.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.351
{\an3}Think about it,
when you go

00:18.435 --> 00:21.563
inside that voting booth, you're
not just Tracy Gaylian anymore.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.607
You're making decisions for
everyone; you're making the law.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.151
{\an1}You ever think about
running the world?

00:26.234 --> 00:27.277
{\an3}Well, it's a dirty job,
but someone's got to do it.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.403
You <i> should</i> do it.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.779
I'd like to,
but, you know, Mark,

00:29.863 --> 00:30.780
my plate's
a little full right now.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.448
I got school;
I'm running this TV station--

00:32.531 --> 00:33.992
{\an1}you're not helping me at all.
No, no,

00:34.075 --> 00:35.118
not run the world--
get on the air,

00:35.201 --> 00:36.995
{\an3}do the show with Tracy;
you guys make a great pair.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.788
Not a chance.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.957
{\an1}Oh, come on, Brandon,
it'll be fun.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.917
I promise to disagree
with almost everything you say.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.461
{\an1}And that'll be fun?
Yes, it'll make

00:44.544 --> 00:45.920
{\an3}great television.
No, no, no, no.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.840
<i>Pee Wee's Playhouse--</i>
now, that was great TV.

00:48.923 --> 00:49.883
21 Emmy awards.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.259
This would not be...

00:51.342 --> 00:52.844
Ah, working hard, I see.

00:52.927 --> 00:53.762
A little too hard.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.972
What do you say we
take a break, guys?

00:56.055 --> 00:57.307
{\an1}Yeah, we're supposed
to meet Kelly

00:57.390 --> 00:58.808
{\an1}for a bite
at the Peach Pit.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.018
David, you
want to go?

01:00.101 --> 01:01.811
Oh, no. No, thanks, I can't.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.938
I got to go to my grandmother's
tonight in Palm Springs.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.274
{\an1}We're reading
the will tomorrow.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.611
{\an3}Oh, come on, Mark, I guess
we better get going.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.070
{\an3}BRANDON:
See you guys there.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.657
Listen, Dave, uh...

01:14.741 --> 01:17.160
I was real sorry to hear
about your grandfather.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.953
{\an3}I know you guys
were close.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.500
{\an1}Yeah, it's hard
to believe he's gone.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.006
{\an1}I was supposed to visit
him last week, and...

01:30.089 --> 01:32.300
(sighs)

01:32.383 --> 01:34.344
I blew him off.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.471
Hey, don't be too hard
on yourself about that.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.014
{\an3}There's no way you
could've known.

01:39.307 --> 01:43.311
{\an1}Yeah, well, I wish somebody
would tell my father.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.689
{\an1}I feel guilty enough
without him beating me up.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.863
Is there anything
I can do for you?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.031
You need anything?

01:55.114 --> 01:58.326
No, no. No, I'm cool.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.369
{\an1}Go ahead.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.703
All right.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.205
You take it easy, brother.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.748
{\an3}Thanks, man.
Yeah.

Yep.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.397
Very beautiful out there.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.314
{\an1}Thanks.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.942
{\an1}What are you doing here?
Following me now?

04:36.025 --> 04:38.486
{\an3}I just wanted to talk
to you, that's all.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.613
So talk.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.033
I want you back, Clare.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.576
Isn't it a bit late for this?

04:45.660 --> 04:47.203
{\an3}Why, because you're
with Dick Harrison now?

04:47.286 --> 04:48.496
What do you see in that guy?

04:48.579 --> 04:51.874
You know, Dick's here
at 6:15 every morning.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.376
Every morning.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.378
Oh, I'm impressed.
He's committed.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.547
{\an1}He knows what he wants;
he goes after it.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.464
He's a mature man, Steve.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.216
{\an3}Why, because he rows?
What, do you think

05:00.299 --> 05:01.884
{\an3}I never rowed a boat
before in my life?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.011
Give me a break.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.721
You okay, Clare?
Yeah, she's fine.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.348
She was just telling me
all about the joys of rowing.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.600
So much so, in fact,
I'm thinking about getting

05:09.684 --> 05:11.436
{\an5}the old KEG shell
out myself.
KEG doesn't row.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.562
Maybe we should.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.689
{\an3}(chuckles)
Whatever. Let's go.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.524
One sec, okay?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.446
Steve, don't go there, okay?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.406
Do not collect $200,

05:23.489 --> 05:26.409
do not pass go,
just... go away.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.369
I will.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.371
But I'll be back.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.334
(sighs)

05:38.838 --> 05:39.922
You're such a coward, Kenny.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.425
You know, I have to call
before your secretary shows up

05:42.508 --> 05:43.551
just to get you on the phone.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.552
What do you want, Valerie?

05:44.635 --> 05:45.511
I want the money.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.263
The bank said
you put a hold on the check.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.431
Yeah, well,
did you have it yet?

05:48.514 --> 05:49.432
What do you mean, "it"?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.933
Just go ahead and say it.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.728
The abortion.
Did you have the abortion yet?

05:53.811 --> 05:54.979
No.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.564
Well, we had a deal.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.775
I give you $l00,000,
and you handle this problem.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.568
Not until I get the money.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.653
You said you were
gonna leave her.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.573
{\an4}No, I know you'd
like to pretend
this never happened.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.200
I wish I could, too.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.160
{\an1}But I'm the one
who's pregnant here.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.329
{\an1}No, don't worry,
I'll get it done tomorrow.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.663
{\an1}No, I don't
want you there.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.458
You've done enough already,
don't you think?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.463
I just got home.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.090
{\an3}You were listening?
Yeah.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.800
I couldn't help but overhear.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.968
You're pregnant?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.345
Listen, Steve,

06:27.428 --> 06:29.180
you can't tell
anybody, okay?

06:29.263 --> 06:31.265
Valerie...
I mean it.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.183
Especially Brandon.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.143
Please promise me, okay?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.686
I'm really ashamed here.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.688
Okay, Val.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.023
Thanks.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.028
What are you gonna do?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.369
Hey, you all set?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.496
{\an1}Yeah. Yeah,
one minute, okay?

06:56.290 --> 06:57.208
(knocking)

06:57.291 --> 06:58.209
Come in.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.502
{\an3}Hey.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.630
{\an6}Hi.
Cliff's dropping me
off at school--
you want a ride?

07:02.713 --> 07:04.715
{\an1}Honestly, I don't even feel
like leaving the house.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.967
It's, like,

07:06.050 --> 07:08.302
{\an5}everywhere I go,
Steve is there.
Yeah,

07:08.386 --> 07:10.680
but you know this is
all about winning you back.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.849
Come on, aren't you flattered
just the teeniest bit?

07:12.932 --> 07:15.476
No. I mean, the whole purpose
of me joining crew

07:15.560 --> 07:18.020
was to meet new people
and forget about him.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.023
I'm just so sick of thinking
about him all the time.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.401
Right, but you can't stop, so
doesn't that tell you something?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.403
Yeah, that you're
a hopeless romantic.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.572
{\an3}Me?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.240
{\an1}I am not.
Oh, come on.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.075
I mean, this
whole thing with Cliff.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.327
I mean, what do you
really know about this guy?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.204
Sure, he's gorgeous, fireman,

07:35.288 --> 07:38.040
literally came out of nowhere
and swept you off your feet...

07:38.124 --> 07:39.500
{\an1}(chuckles)

07:39.584 --> 07:40.835
Forget what I said.
You're right.

07:40.918 --> 07:41.878
That's enough.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.045
(laughs)

07:43.129 --> 07:45.047
I know I really like him,

07:45.131 --> 07:47.508
because he's
taking me hiking tomorrow

07:47.592 --> 07:50.261
and... I hate hiking.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.222
But he's... he's honest
and he's sweet

07:53.306 --> 07:55.892
and he's tall, rugged,

07:55.975 --> 07:59.020
and he smells
just a little bit like smoke,

07:59.103 --> 08:00.396
kind of like hickory.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.231
Sounds like a barbecue sauce.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.358
{\an4}Hey, I've heard you
gush before.
Never.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.651
When?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.612
When you were with Steve.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.992
(exhales)

08:21.500 --> 08:23.711
You see, now,
that's where I think

08:23.794 --> 08:25.588
that the government
should step in.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.423
Midriffs, bare thighs--

08:27.506 --> 08:28.591
in class, right?

08:28.674 --> 08:31.928
Girls are reaching their
tanned, toned arms up high.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.804
{\an3}I think that's called
"raising your hand," junior.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.765
{\an3}We do it to get the
professor's attention.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.100
{\an4}Well, it certainly
gets his.
Mm-hmm.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.854
Hey, that doesn't mean that
I've got a p-problem with sex.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.897
Because I don't.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.607
{\an5}TRACY:
No, no issues
at all.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.943
I guess that
makes me a liberal, huh?

08:49.654 --> 08:52.323
Like, I like my government
at a distance, okay?

08:52.406 --> 08:53.908
I wear what I want.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.744
And that includes
belts and hats, okay?

08:56.827 --> 08:58.704
I mean, nobody's telling <i> me</i>
that I have

08:58.788 --> 09:00.498
to strap on a seat belt
or, like,

09:00.581 --> 09:02.250
wear a helmet on a motorcycle.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.294
They're trying to save
your life, sweetheart,

09:05.378 --> 09:07.630
not retool your wardrobe.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.341
So, what are you,

09:10.424 --> 09:11.634
liberal or conservative?

09:11.717 --> 09:14.512
I've been thinking, you know,
maybe we shouldn't editorialize.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.305
Just give 'em
the students' opinions.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.431
Yeah, maybe.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.183
But in the meantime,
where do <i> you</i> stand?

09:19.267 --> 09:19.725
Why are you so curious?

09:19.809 --> 09:20.518
I just want to know.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.477
To be honest,

09:21.560 --> 09:24.021
uh, you could put me down
as "undecided."

09:24.105 --> 09:26.357
{\an1}You know, I see both sides
of a lot of issues.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.651
Undecided is good
if it keeps you fair.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.821
Although it's not so good
if it keeps you on the fence

09:31.904 --> 09:33.114
instead of taking action.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.615
{\an3}Really?
Yes, really.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.409
I think there comes a point
in time in your life

09:36.492 --> 09:38.452
when you need to make a decision
as to what kind of world

09:38.536 --> 09:39.829
you want to live in,
what kind of life

09:39.912 --> 09:42.581
{\an5}you want to lead.
Just figure out what you want
and go after it?

09:42.665 --> 09:46.419
Vacillation is a sure way
to offend both sides.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.421
Ah, so you like a woman
who knows her own mind.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
I like that in everyone.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.845
BOY:
Uh, well, you know, anarchy,

09:55.928 --> 09:58.848
you know, total mass
urban revolution, just...

10:00.808 --> 10:02.685
Well, I should
probably get to class.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.978
{\an3}Okay.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.104
See ya.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.315
But there's one thing
I've been meaning to ask you.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.357
Fire away.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.650
What do you want to know?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.485
When was the last time
you made love?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.362
{\an1}What?
I'm thinking

10:13.446 --> 10:15.698
about doing a piece
for the campus TV station

10:15.781 --> 10:18.034
and, you know, students'
attitudes about sex,

10:18.117 --> 10:19.368
that kind of thing.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.287
Oh, so this is not
a personal question?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.371
Of course not.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.040
It's a made-for-TV question.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.375
In that case, I'll answer you.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.877
It's been a while.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.712
{\an1}It's been
a while. Okay.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.256
Any changes
in status anticipated?

10:32.340 --> 10:35.551
Shouldn't you
be writing this down?

10:35.634 --> 10:37.053
For the show?

10:37.136 --> 10:39.055
Well, that last question
was a little more personal.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.056
Mm-hmm.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.349
{\an1}And your answer
is...?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.894
Not for a while.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.228
Okay.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.688
Okay?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.733
{\an1}Good.
And here's another.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.360
{\an3}I think that
this interview

10:52.443 --> 10:53.861
is over.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.238
{\an6}Wait, just one more:
have you ever...
No.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.948
Well, how often do you like...

10:58.032 --> 11:00.993
<i>Never.</i> You should go.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.703
All right.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.247
See ya.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.083
{\an3}Hey, Steve.
How's it going?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.209
Downhill.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.294
{\an3}I'm sorry to
hear that.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.924
{\an3}What's the
matter, bubeleh?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.884
It's not me, it's a friend.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.428
Usually when someone says that,
they're talking about themself.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.597
Oh, no, it's not me.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.265
I'm not pregnant.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.850
Pregnant?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.103
{\an3}Oh, my God, don't tell
me Clare's pregnant.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.105
No. No, not Clare.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.147
Then who?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.690
Just a friend who has

11:31.774 --> 11:33.150
another friend
who really ought to know

11:33.234 --> 11:34.443
about the first
friend's problem.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.611
Steve...

11:35.694 --> 11:36.779
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.114
I can't tell you, Kelly.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.698
I've been sworn to secrecy.

11:40.699 --> 11:41.867
Well...

11:41.951 --> 11:43.911
I wouldn't want you
to tell me, then.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.122
I got to tell somebody, though.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.082
I don't know how
to deal with this by myself.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.208
{\an3}No, no,

11:49.291 --> 11:52.086
I would never ask you to betray
a confidence like that.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.587
Okay, stop pressuring me--
it's Valerie.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.339
{\an1}Valerie?
Yeah, and-and,

11:55.423 --> 11:56.799
Kelly, you can't say anything.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.843
I really didn't want
to bring this up,

11:58.926 --> 12:01.095
but I don't know
what to do for her.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.973
{\an4}So the friend that
ought to know is Brandon.
Yeah, Brandon would know

12:04.056 --> 12:06.809
what to do, but she specifically
said not to tell Brandon.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.853
Well, what's she gonna do?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.938
She's gonna have
an abortion tomorrow.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.148
{\an1}She's in this
all by herself.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.149
Well, where's Kenny?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.151
History. She's all alone.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.278
That's why I thought
I should tell Brandon.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.654
No, she'd hate you for that.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.614
Why don't you let me
talk to her first.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.158
{\an3}You?
Yes, me.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.993
Don't worry, I'll be nice.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.328
Kelly, if she finds out
that I told you...

12:26.412 --> 12:27.329
She won't.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.999
Steve, we are talking
major life crisis here.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.168
Nobody should have
to go through this alone.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
Not even Valerie.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.509
{\an5}MAN:
<i>"In conclusion,</i>
<i>I give and bequeath</i>

12:40.593 --> 12:43.929
{\an1}"to my son, Mel,
the sum of $250,000

12:44.013 --> 12:45.389
"if he shall survive me.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.017
{\an1}"To my grandson, David,
I give and bequeath

12:48.100 --> 12:50.895
{\an1}"my 1961 Thunderbird
convertible

12:50.978 --> 12:55.357
"and the sum of $250,000
if he shall survive me.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.193
{\an1}"All of the rest,
residue and remainder

12:57.276 --> 12:59.361
{\an1}"of the property I own,
real and personal,

12:59.445 --> 13:02.239
{\an1}"at the time of my death,
I give, bequeath and devise

13:02.323 --> 13:05.367
{\an1}to my spouse, Adele,
if she shall survive me."

13:06.785 --> 13:10.039
Okay? Any questions?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.957
Uh, no.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.001
No.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.045
Thanks for coming
by the house, George.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.630
Oh, sure, Mel.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.012
(clears throat softly)

13:25.095 --> 13:26.847
I can't believe this.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.268
{\an3}Your grandfather
loved you, David...

13:31.352 --> 13:33.062
{\an3}very much.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.605
Did you know about this?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.691
No. No, I didn't.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.071
(heavy sigh)

13:42.154 --> 13:44.365
{\an1}(wry chuckle)
It's unbelievable.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.791
Here we go.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.252
{\an1}Have you talked
to Valerie lately?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.254
Yeah, I talk to
her every day.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.839
How does she seem to you?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.049
Like Valerie.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.425
Why? What's up?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.802
Everything okay?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.263
Yeah, I'm meeting her here.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.305
You and Valerie?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.932
I thought you two
don't even talk.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.226
{\an1}Well, we have something
to talk about now.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.104
Here she is.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.148
{\an6}Should I hide
the breakables?
(laughs)

14:18.232 --> 14:19.483
Hi, Val.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.110
Hey.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.112
Hi.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.947
Glad you got my message.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.908
{\an1}(clears throat)
So... what did I do wrong now?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.326
Nothing.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.829
{\an3}I just thought we
should get together.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.247
{\an1}Well, can you get
to the point?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.790
'Cause I'm kind of
having a bad day.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.959
{\an3}All right.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.795
{\an3}Look, I know
we're not close,

14:39.878 --> 14:41.880
but if you want to talk

14:41.964 --> 14:43.299
or if there's anything

14:43.382 --> 14:45.092
{\an3}I can help you to get
through this...

14:45.175 --> 14:47.094
"Through this." This what?

14:48.345 --> 14:50.347
I know you're pregnant.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.517
{\an4}I guessed.
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.644
{\an3}Who else did Steve tell?
No one.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.272
He's just worried about you.
So am I.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.482
Oh, come on, Kelly,
I sleep with a married man,

15:00.566 --> 15:02.026
I get knocked up
and he dumps me.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.861
{\an1}He won't even return
my calls now.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.154
You couldn't have planned
a happier ending

15:05.237 --> 15:06.780
with a Voodoo doll
and a lock of my hair.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.782
No. You've got it all wrong.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.743
I wouldn't wish this on anybody.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.662
{\an3}All right? Look,
I know how Kenny is.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.039
I used to baby-sit his kid.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.749
You don't think he hit on me?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.335
So that's supposed
to make me feel better now?

15:19.418 --> 15:22.338
Look, I'm just saying that...

15:22.421 --> 15:24.340
I'm not blaming you.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.675
Believe me, I did not
come here to hurt you.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.843
So what did you come here for?

15:27.926 --> 15:32.348
I am trying really hard
to put our past behind us here.

15:32.431 --> 15:37.353
I just want you to know that
I'm here for you if you need me.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.729
Woman to woman.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.106
You know what I mean?

15:44.860 --> 15:48.697
Well, it's been really hard
not having anybody to talk to.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.574
I'm sure it has.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.576
You know, when
you're seeing a married man,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.536
you can't tell everybody
that you're happy,

15:54.620 --> 15:58.457
and you figure nobody wants
to know when it's over.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.334
It's been pretty lonely.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.086
Well, what are you gonna do?

16:03.629 --> 16:08.342
Steve also told me that you have
an appointment tomorrow.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.094
{\an3}Why don't I
come with you?

16:10.177 --> 16:12.388
No, Kelly, I need
to do this by myself.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.722
{\an3}I've been through
this before

16:13.806 --> 16:15.766
with my mother--
it's not gonna be easy.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.726
You should have
somebody with you.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.561
{\an6}Kelly, please.
I'm picking
you up,

16:19.645 --> 16:21.230
and that's final.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.565
You need a friend right now.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.359
Even if it's me.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.540
Come on there, slowpoke.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.541
{\an3}(giggles)

16:40.624 --> 16:43.627
{\an3}Aren't we supposed to stop
and smell the roses?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.588
{\an1}Well, I wouldn't get
too close to that one.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.923
That's, um, poison sumac.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.258
Oh. Cool.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.218
(both laugh)

16:51.301 --> 16:53.929
Hey, what about this one?

16:54.012 --> 16:57.725
Well, it's not much to look at,
but it tastes good.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.101
Smells like...

16:59.184 --> 17:00.936
rosemary?
Very good.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.271
Ah.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.064
{\an1}You know, there's
some sage here.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.066
We can use this for dinner.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.737
{\an3}Oh. I didn't know dinner
was included with this hike.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.613
Well, that is, if you're free.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.740
Well, that depends.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.575
Uh, would that be
the main course?

17:14.657 --> 17:15.784
{\an1}(chuckles)
No.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.119
{\an1}I did bring some
supplies in my pack.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.748
{\an1}You know, about a mile away
from here there's a lake.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.624
{\an1}It's a really
beautiful spot.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.501
Great. Lead on.

17:29.423 --> 17:33.302
{\an5}STEVE:
All right, we're gonna show Dick
and his idiots we can do this.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.346
You all right, Pauly?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.765
It's so skinny.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.808
{\an1}I didn't think
it would be so skinny.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.810
{\an3}It's no big deal;
it's stable.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.271
Go ahead, get in.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.608
{\an3}Whoa.
Bend your knees.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.984
Stay low, stay low!

17:49.067 --> 17:50.611
{\an3}Stay low!
Whoa!

17:50.694 --> 17:53.489
(laughter)

17:53.572 --> 17:54.615
{\an1}DICK:
Hey, guys,

17:54.698 --> 17:57.618
it works better if you
stay <i> in</i> the boat, okay?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.827
{\an3}Thanks for
the tip, Dick.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.496
{\an1}Hey, I'm just
trying to help.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.581
Well, why don't you
stay out of the way.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.749
I don't foresee
a problem there.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.460
{\an1}Let us know when you manage
to get your oars in the water.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.170
You guys think you're so hot.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
We challenge you.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.839
{\an1}(chuckles)
Yeah, right.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.508
We'll kick your butt.
Wait, wait a minute,

18:12.591 --> 18:14.343
{\an1}you actually want
to race us?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.512
{\an3}No, he doesn't.
Yeah, we do.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.388
We just need a little practice,
that's all.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.390
{\an4}I don't know, Sanders,
you know, some of us
graduate in May.

18:20.474 --> 18:25.646
Okay, pal,
you pick the time-- how's that?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.815
A week from today.

18:27.898 --> 18:28.524
Deal.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.483
Deal.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.528
Let's go, guys.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.696
(Dick chuckling)

18:34.780 --> 18:36.824
Unbelievable.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.835
Wow.

18:47.918 --> 18:48.627
'61 Thunderbird.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.170
It's the first car
I ever drove.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.673
{\an1}I remember when Grandpa
took me out to the desert

18:52.756 --> 18:54.550
{\an1}and, uh, I couldn't
reach the pedals,

18:54.633 --> 18:57.261
{\an1}so he let me sit
on his lap and steer.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.721
(laughs)
I remember that day.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.599
Oh, you were so excited.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.769
Look, Grandma,
about last week...

19:05.853 --> 19:06.895
It doesn't matter.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.565
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.568
{\an6}Well, he asked after
you-- I told him you
were on your way.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.111
So he didn't know?

19:14.194 --> 19:15.529
He loved you, David,

19:15.612 --> 19:18.615
{\an3}and he knew you loved him--
that's what matters.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.453
This was Grandpa's
pride and joy, David.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.455
Take good care of it.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.041
(sighs)
Yeah, I plan to.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.044
{\an3}By the way, I talked to
the attorney this morning,

19:31.128 --> 19:34.965
{\an6}and we had a great idea
for the money that
Grandpa left you.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.259
Really? What's that?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.094
We're gonna set up a trust.

19:39.177 --> 19:39.761
{\an1}A trust?

19:39.845 --> 19:40.721
{\an3}How does that work?
Well,

19:40.804 --> 19:41.722
{\an3}the money will be
invested on your behalf,

19:41.805 --> 19:44.308
{\an3}and as the trustee, I'll
release it as need be.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.393
Like an allowance.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.603
Mm-hmm.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.313
Is that how Grandpa wanted it?

19:49.396 --> 19:50.606
He didn't specify.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.065
{\an1}Then why are you trying
to screw with it?

19:52.149 --> 19:53.150
{\an3}Mel,

19:53.233 --> 19:55.944
maybe we should just go inside
and talk about this.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.404
Come on, come on inside.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.489
{\an3}I'll put something out
for us, we'll talk.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.076
I'll be in
in a minute, Mom.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.621
David, it's a quarter
of a million dollars.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.955
{\an3}That's a big
responsibility.

20:07.039 --> 20:07.956
{\an1}So what, I'm
not responsible?

20:08.040 --> 20:08.999
I'm doing this for you.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.126
(chuckles quietly)

20:14.880 --> 20:16.673
David, we're not finished.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.799
You heard the lawyer--

20:17.883 --> 20:19.092
the money's mine.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.886
Grandpa believed in me,
even if you don't.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.429
I'll contest this, David.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.056
{\an3}I'll take you to
court if I have to.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.807
You're just the type of father
to do that, aren't you?

20:25.891 --> 20:26.808
You bet I am.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.977
{\an3}We're not
through here.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.520
Where are you going?

20:30.604 --> 20:31.813
I don't know, the nearest bar?

20:31.897 --> 20:32.814
{\an3}You think because
some bartender

20:32.898 --> 20:34.149
serves you, you're an adult?

20:34.232 --> 20:35.984
It takes more than that, David.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.778
Dad, I'm never gonna be
an adult to you,

20:37.861 --> 20:40.197
whether I'm 21 or 41-- that's
never gonna change, will it?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.666
(tires squeal)

20:50.749 --> 20:53.001
(phone ringing)

20:55.087 --> 20:56.630
Hello?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.006
Kelly, hi. It's Valerie.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.008
Hey, I was just on my way over.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.677
Listen, I'm glad I caught you.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.844
Um... Kenny called.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.805
He's gonna take me
to the clinic.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.890
{\an5}Yeah, he's
on his way over right now.
Really?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.684
He cleared his whole day for me.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.686
Are you sure you want him there?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.854
Look, I know I painted
a pretty bleak picture

21:12.938 --> 21:13.689
of our relationship, but...

21:13.772 --> 21:15.357
I think this
will give us closure.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.152
All right. Um,
why don't I stop by later?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.988
No, you don't have to,
it's okay.

21:21.071 --> 21:21.863
I want to.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.157
(laughs)
I can't get rid of you, can I?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.575
Not likely.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.120
Okay. It'll be good to see you.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.538
Hang in there, Val.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.998
It's gonna be okay.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.749
Yeah. Thanks.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.668
I'll call you when it's over.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.961
All right.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.428
Let's make camp here.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.264
{\an1}Then, uh, we'll take
a walk around the lake.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.058
Okay. Um, here
in the shade?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.394
Yeah.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.521
Here, I got it.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.523
(laughs softly)

21:56.606 --> 21:58.483
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.115
{\an3}Uh, well, I bet you did
a lot of camping as a kid.

22:05.198 --> 22:07.242
Only on the fire escape.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.244
I grew up in Manhattan.

22:09.327 --> 22:10.954
You're a city kid?

22:11.038 --> 22:13.373
{\an1}Hell's Kitchen,
until I joined the Navy.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.875
But I did go to school uptown.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.752
So, along the way I used to pass

22:16.835 --> 22:17.711
through Central Park every day.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.296
{\an3}You learned survival skills
in Central Park?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.298
No, I learned those
in Hell's Kitchen.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.134
{\an1}But, uh, I met
a ranger in the park.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.427
In New York City?

22:25.510 --> 22:26.386
Absolutely.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.764
{\an1}Great guy, I mean, he
let me follow him around

22:28.847 --> 22:30.265
{\an1}and later got me
to join the service.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.850
He taught you all about nature?

22:31.933 --> 22:33.935
He kept me out of trouble.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.730
{\an1}I mean, I'll never
forget him.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.732
He saved my life.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.942
So you could save mine.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.237
Yeah.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.999
TRACY:
<i>Thanks for walking me back.</i>

22:56.083 --> 22:57.584
No problem, no problem.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.127
{\an3}You want to come in
for a minute?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.837
{\an1}No, no, I can't,
I got a class,

23:00.921 --> 23:02.756
{\an1}you got a paper to write,
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.341
{\an3}So, you can
come back tonight.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.342
I gotta edit tonight.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.302
{\an1}I'll be lucky if
I get out of there

23:07.385 --> 23:08.345
{\an1}before midnight.
I'll see ya.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.721
So, come by after.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.847
But you'll be in bed.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.599
I know.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.601
We were talking
about deciding

23:14.684 --> 23:16.144
{\an3}what you want
and going after it,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.521
weren't we?
Yes, we were.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.481
That's what I'm doing.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.942
Trace, it...

23:22.025 --> 23:24.778
{\an1}it's not that I'm,
I'm not attracted to you...

23:24.861 --> 23:27.280
{\an3}Hmm, you have a funny
way of showing it.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.657
Look, if we sleep
together, it's...

23:28.740 --> 23:30.325
it's gonna mean something.

23:30.408 --> 23:31.993
{\an3}It's going to mean
something to me, too.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.537
I'm not looking for
a casual thing here.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.664
{\an1}Yeah, but you see,
I'm not...

23:35.747 --> 23:38.875
{\an1}looking for a serious
thing right now.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.461
(scoffs) Okay,

23:41.545 --> 23:42.838
I understand.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.840
{\an1}No, Trace, I don't
think you do.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.591
Brandon.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.189
{\an1}Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice, Linda.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.357
{\an3}Oh, I am so glad
that you called me

24:02.440 --> 24:03.275
when your plans changed.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.527
{\an3}I spend so much time
at the Friendship House,

24:05.610 --> 24:06.695
{\an3}that the only way
I ever get to do anything

24:06.778 --> 24:07.946
is at the last minute.

24:08.029 --> 24:11.700
My work with you at the hospice
really put me in good standing

24:11.783 --> 24:13.702
with the Psychology department.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.829
{\an1}I'm thinking maybe
next semester I'll...

24:18.081 --> 24:19.666
That's weird.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.084
What's weird?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.880
Um, I know him.

24:25.839 --> 24:26.756
{\an3}Hey, Kelly.
Hi.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.049
How are you?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.551
Good, what are you doing here?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.720
My office is just up the street.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.764
Hi, Kenny Bannerman.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.891
Oh, sorry.
Linda Hill.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.225
Nice to meet you, Linda.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.351
So, you're having lunch?

24:38.435 --> 24:41.521
Yeah, I've been in meetings
all morning and I'm out

24:41.605 --> 24:42.772
{\an3}for a quick bite,
and, uh,

24:42.856 --> 24:44.107
back into the trenches we go.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.735
Say hi to your mom
and Mel for me, would you?

24:46.818 --> 24:48.737
Mm-hmm, sure.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.447
Give my love
to Diane and Michael.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.615
I will. Have a good lunch.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.408
Bye.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.243
I don't get this.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.578
{\an3}What?

24:56.661 --> 24:58.955
His being here, he's uh,

24:59.039 --> 25:00.582
supposed to be someplace else.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.250
Is something wrong?

25:02.334 --> 25:06.713
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
something's very wrong.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.722
(doorbell chimes)

25:18.725 --> 25:19.643
Hey, Kel.
Hey.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.727
I'm just on my way out.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.728
What's going on?

25:21.811 --> 25:22.729
I'm looking for Steve.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.064
He's upstairs with Valerie.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.232
She's got the flu or something.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.441
You don't want to catch it.

25:26.524 --> 25:27.567
{\an3}No, I don't.
Okay.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.236
I'll see you later.
All right.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.612
Hey, Kel.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.322
Hey, how's she doing?

25:32.405 --> 25:33.490
Uh, not so good.

25:33.573 --> 25:34.783
She's been in bed all day.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.326
Why don't you go up?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.248
(knocking on door)

25:44.042 --> 25:44.960
Hey.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.503
Hey.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.006
I picked up these
tabloids for you.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.133
I thought they'd be good
for a laugh, of course,

25:52.217 --> 25:53.635
every word is true.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.637
And I thought my life was bad.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.264
Thanks.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.141
How are you feeling?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.560
It was really horrible.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.146
{\an1}A lot worse than I thought
it was going to be.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.231
How's Kenny holding up?

26:06.314 --> 26:09.484
I know he's hurting,
but he's been a real trooper.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.820
So, he really came
through for you?

26:11.903 --> 26:14.114
He was by my side the whole day.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.366
Hmm...

26:16.449 --> 26:17.867
I saw him at lunch.

26:20.578 --> 26:21.329
You saw Kenny?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.456
Yeah, yeah.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.000
I was having lunch
in Beverly Hills.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.543
And there he was.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.961
When he was supposed
to be with you.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.588
Well, he took a break for lunch.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.049
He took a break for lunch?

26:34.968 --> 26:36.011
What, you don't believe me?

26:36.094 --> 26:37.304
No, I don't.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.222
{\an3}Kenny wasn't
with you today,

26:39.306 --> 26:40.098
and you know it.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.268
All right, okay,
I'll tell you the truth.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.312
He didn't show.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.063
I had to do the whole
thing by myself today.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.316
Why didn't you call me, Valerie?

26:49.399 --> 26:50.900
You know I would've come.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.360
I was too embarrassed.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.528
{\an1}Kelly,

26:53.611 --> 26:54.654
I got stood up.

26:54.738 --> 26:55.697
Do you believe me now?

26:59.617 --> 27:01.161
Get some rest.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.412
We'll talk about it later.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.509
{\an1}Hey.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.011
Is that for Valerie?

27:18.094 --> 27:20.347
Yeah, a little something
to cheer up the patient.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.556
She said she wasn't hungry,

27:21.639 --> 27:22.932
{\an1}but I'm gonna
feed her anyway.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.726
Steve, something
is really wrong.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.727
What?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.395
When I offered
to go with her,

27:27.479 --> 27:29.397
{\an3}she told me Kenny
was taking her.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.024
Then I saw Kenny out
having lunch today.

27:31.107 --> 27:31.900
{\an3}So?
So,

27:31.983 --> 27:33.902
{\an3}she told me he was
taking a lunch break

27:33.985 --> 27:35.236
{\an3}in the middle
of her abortion.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.279
Does that make sense to you?

27:36.363 --> 27:38.698
Well, maybe he was hungry
or he had an appointment.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.534
{\an3}When I confronted her,
she admitted that she lied

27:41.618 --> 27:43.286
and then she told
me another story.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.748
{\an1}Kel, the girl just
had an abortion.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.750
{\an1}Why don't you
cut her some slack?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.752
{\an3}Fine.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.098
Here you go.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.433
{\an3}Thanks.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.981
We should come back here.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.525
Yeah, I'd like that.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.279
Did you know that bald
eagles mate for life?

28:18.363 --> 28:20.782
Really?

28:20.865 --> 28:23.284
When they make love,

28:23.368 --> 28:26.955
{\an1}in midair they latch
onto each other

28:27.038 --> 28:30.417
{\an1}and then they plummet
towards the ground.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.130
That's...

28:35.213 --> 28:37.549
terrifying.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.218
Not for them.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.763
Cliff,

28:43.847 --> 28:46.975
{\an3}I really like spending
time with you.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.481
{\an1}Donna...

28:53.565 --> 28:56.484
I'm leaving tomorrow.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.153
What?

28:58.236 --> 29:00.280
I'm leaving the department.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.824
I'll be working safety crew

29:02.907 --> 29:05.076
{\an1}on an oil rig offshore
in Louisiana.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.080
You didn't tell me that.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.208
How long are you going for?

29:12.292 --> 29:16.504
I'm not sure.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.839
{\an1}I'm sorry.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.508
I know I should have told you.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.677
{\an1}It's just that I thought
if you knew I was leaving,

29:22.760 --> 29:25.472
you wouldn't want
to get to know me.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.432
Was I right?

29:31.102 --> 29:32.562
I don't know.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.355
Are you mad?

29:36.441 --> 29:39.402
{\an3}I guess I'm
just disappointed.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.530
'Cause I like you.

29:45.783 --> 29:48.161
I like you, too.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.329
That's a good thing, isn't it?

29:51.122 --> 29:54.417
Yeah.

29:54.501 --> 29:58.922
So, so what do we do now?

29:59.005 --> 30:01.841
Well, since it's a good thing,

30:01.925 --> 30:06.054
let's make the best of it.

30:24.822 --> 30:27.242
Hi.
Hey.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.410
{\an3}I thought you
might be in here.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.913
Yeah, uh, listen, I'm glad you,

30:31.996 --> 30:33.206
uh, I'm glad you stopped by.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.207
I was hoping you would.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.917
But I thought you left
right after the show.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.210
I did.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.211
I came back to see you.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.255
Listen, Trace, about before--

30:40.338 --> 30:41.881
Brandon, don't apologize.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.299
{\an1}It's just gonna
make me feel worse.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.385
{\an1}And I don't think
I could feel any worse.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.887
{\an3}You don't have anything
to feel bad about.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.264
I can't help it.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.932
{\an1}I feel embarrassed
just talking to you.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.770
So, um, this is gonna
be my last week here.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.730
What?

30:57.814 --> 31:00.942
I just feel really
uncomfortable working with you.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.403
{\an1}I guess I can't handle
rejection very well.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.572
Well, I wish there was, uh,

31:05.655 --> 31:08.116
{\an3}something I could say
to make you change your mind.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.117
{\an1}I don't think
there's anything

31:09.200 --> 31:10.660
either of us can
do about it now.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.293
{\an1}Did you, uh,
tell Mark about this yet?

31:18.376 --> 31:20.378
I'll tell him after
tomorrow's broadcast.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.312
Oh, perfect.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.646
{\an3}How about some coffee
next time, hon?

31:38.730 --> 31:41.232
Just keep them coming.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.664
{\an3}I've been to three bars
looking for you.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.334
{\an1}Wow.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.294
Three bars in one night?

32:01.377 --> 32:03.463
{\an1}(scoffs)
You're a wild man.

32:05.048 --> 32:05.965
You want a drink?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.175
No.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.843
{\an3}Why not?

32:08.926 --> 32:10.845
I can afford it.

32:10.928 --> 32:14.182
David, I'd like you to let me
drive you back to the house.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.685
{\an1}Yeah, you'd also like
to take that money.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.647
{\an3}I don't want to take
anything from you, David.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.024
{\an1}Why don't you just
take away my TV time?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.026
{\an1}What, are you gonna
ground me, Dad?

32:25.109 --> 32:26.694
I don't know, what's
the proper punishment

32:26.778 --> 32:28.988
for bailing out on your
Grandfather's last day?

32:29.072 --> 32:29.947
{\an3}I don't want to
punish you, David.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.741
{\an3}And I hate to see you
punishing yourself.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.409
{\an3}David!

32:35.161 --> 32:36.871
{\an1}I don't give a damn
about the money.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.040
{\an3}No?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.750
{\an3}No, well what <i> do</i> you
give a damn about?

32:40.833 --> 32:41.918
{\an3}Tell me, please,
because I'm trying

32:42.001 --> 32:43.044
to do the best I can here.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.337
{\an3}Just what do you
want from me?

32:44.420 --> 32:45.338
I want respect!

32:45.421 --> 32:46.381
Respect?!

32:46.464 --> 32:47.590
David, you better

32:47.674 --> 32:48.758
take a long, hard
look at yourself.

32:48.841 --> 32:51.678
No, Dad, you need to take a
long hard look at yourself.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.720
Look at you,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.931
taking your own kid to court.

32:55.014 --> 32:58.226
Going against your own father's
last will and testament?!

32:58.309 --> 33:00.728
{\an3}You don't have
respect for anybody.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.356
Your Grandfather would've
wanted me to protect you.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.400
No, he told us what he wanted!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.819
And I don't need
your protection.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.408
I lost my father
this week, okay?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.034
Now don't make
me leave here

33:15.118 --> 33:16.911
{\an3}worrying about
losing you, too.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.579
Please, David.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.249
Let me drive you home.

33:21.332 --> 33:25.378
I think I'll take a cab.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.847
{\an1}Don't you let him
get behind the wheel.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.290
Here before Dick, huh?

34:02.373 --> 34:03.291
Yeah, impressed?

34:03.374 --> 34:05.793
No.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.795
{\an1}Ah, come on, Arnold,
throw me a bone.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.839
{\an1}Tell me you miss me,
why don't you?

34:09.922 --> 34:13.384
{\an3}How can I miss you when you've
been following me for weeks?

34:13.467 --> 34:15.178
Has it been that bad?

34:15.261 --> 34:18.473
No, I just want you to
accept the way things are.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.435
This is the way
things are now, huh?

34:22.518 --> 34:23.978
You're happy with Dick?

34:24.061 --> 34:25.480
Yep, that's right.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.483
You don't love me anymore?

34:28.565 --> 34:30.318
No.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.069
I don't think I do.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.409
So, I'm wasting my time?

34:39.494 --> 34:43.164
Yeah, you are.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.831
I love you, Clare.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.918
I'm not giving up.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.335
I've changed.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.712
{\an3}I just wish you'd give me
a chance to prove it.

34:49.795 --> 34:52.465
{\an1}Well, you do
what you have to do.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.191
Hey, should you be up?

35:10.274 --> 35:11.567
You look worse than I do.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.444
Yeah, that crew's killing me.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.905
So, are you going to go watch
Brandon's broadcast debut?

35:15.988 --> 35:17.865
Yeah, are you gonna tune in?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.368
Yeah, from under my covers.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.163
{\an3}How long did the doctor
say to stay off your feet?

35:24.247 --> 35:26.040
Just a day or two.

35:26.123 --> 35:27.166
Is that one or two?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.085
Until I feel better.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.211
Did he give you anything?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.212
Did he give you a prescription?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.548
Yeah, some antibiotics
and some kind of Valium.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.216
That sort of thing.

35:35.299 --> 35:35.883
Are you taking them?

35:35.967 --> 35:38.219
Actually, as a matter of fact,

35:38.302 --> 35:39.846
{\an3}I was so doped up
after the procedure

35:39.929 --> 35:41.222
I forgot they were in my purse.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.598
{\an1}But you got them
filled though, right?

35:42.682 --> 35:45.268
Yeah, sure.
Cool, when?

35:45.351 --> 35:47.228
{\an3}Steve, why are you asking
so many questions?

35:47.311 --> 35:48.771
You sound like Kelly.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.941
Sorry, I didn't mean to push.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.705
Hey, good morning, Grandma.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.874
I'm sorry I got in
so late last night.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.375
I was asleep.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.377
I didn't even hear you come in.

36:11.460 --> 36:15.715
{\an1}Can I get you
breakfast or something?

36:15.798 --> 36:18.259
No, thanks, I'm okay.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.303
Is Dad around?

36:20.386 --> 36:22.138
He had a meeting.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.099
Don't tell me.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.475
With the lawyer?

36:31.063 --> 36:32.398
Why is he doing this to me?

36:32.481 --> 36:33.649
Because he loves you.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.067
{\an3}I know he loves me,
I just...

36:35.151 --> 36:36.736
I wish he'd trust me

36:36.819 --> 36:38.571
not to ruin everything
I put my hands on.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.156
I mean, Grandpa did.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.116
Oh, do you know your grandfather

36:42.199 --> 36:44.118
never let your father
drive that car?

36:44.201 --> 36:44.952
Not on a date,

36:45.036 --> 36:47.955
not on a prom,
not for graduation,

36:48.039 --> 36:49.999
{\an1}and no pleading
on your father's part

36:50.082 --> 36:51.626
could convince him.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.960
Well, why?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.587
I mean, that doesn't
sound like Grandpa.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.548
Well, David,

36:57.632 --> 37:02.094
{\an1}sometimes the things
you want to give the most

37:02.178 --> 37:04.847
{\an1}are the hardest
to part with.

37:06.223 --> 37:09.143
What do you want
from your father?

37:09.226 --> 37:13.230
He asked me the same thing.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.151
Respect.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.819
That's funny.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.154
You two are so alike.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.031
That's what he wants from you.

37:22.114 --> 37:25.242
Well, I guess it's hard
for me to give it to him.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.327
Oh, I know.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.454
And, David?

37:28.537 --> 37:29.455
Hmm?

37:29.538 --> 37:31.749
Don't drink so much.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.965
DIRECTOR:
60 seconds!

37:39.048 --> 37:40.216
We're live in the studio
in 60 seconds.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.968
Make-up, Brandon?

37:42.051 --> 37:43.970
Oh, no thanks.

37:44.053 --> 37:47.640
(crew cheering)

37:47.723 --> 37:49.183
Thank you, thank you.

37:49.266 --> 37:50.685
Thank you very much.
Good to see you all.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.687
Lovely to be here.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.022
DIRECTOR:
In 30 seconds!

37:55.106 --> 37:55.898
I don't believe this.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.191
Am I seeing things?

37:57.274 --> 37:59.318
Ted Koppel, eat your heart out.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.111
You think he's the first
anchor to ever do this?

38:00.194 --> 38:03.197
Why do you think
they sit at desks?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.491
What are you doing?

38:05.574 --> 38:08.160
I've de-pantsed myself
in honor of our first

38:08.244 --> 38:09.537
and last newscast together.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.872
{\an1}And you think I can
get through this segment

38:11.956 --> 38:14.000
{\an1}with you sitting
next to me like this?

38:14.083 --> 38:15.209
Absolutely.

38:15.292 --> 38:16.127
I didn't want you to be

38:16.210 --> 38:18.713
the only embarrassed
anchorperson up here.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.715
{\an6}Brandon.
That's right,
I'm Brandon Walsh,

38:20.798 --> 38:23.884
and I'm not wearing any pants.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.221
DIRECTOR:
In five, four, three, two...

38:27.304 --> 38:30.224
Hi, I'm Brandon Walsh,
joining Tracy Gaylian

38:30.307 --> 38:33.060
for a special production
of the CUTV News team.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.562
{\an5}TRACY:
Tonight, we present
the results...

38:34.645 --> 38:37.732
{\an1}I'm glad to see
you're here, Kelly.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.651
Oh, so you're not mad
at me about Valerie?

38:40.735 --> 38:43.112
No, in fact, I think
I owe you an apology.

38:43.195 --> 38:45.197
Really? Why?

38:45.281 --> 38:48.242
Come outside.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.453
I'll be right back.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.663
What's up?

38:52.747 --> 38:55.624
Well, I just spoke to Valerie.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.085
{\an3}Some of the things that she
said just don't add up.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.086
Like what?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.129
{\an3}Well, she said
after her procedure,

39:00.212 --> 39:02.089
she was so doped up she
couldn't even remember

39:02.173 --> 39:03.758
{\an3}there were prescriptions
in her purse.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.593
Well, that sounds normal.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.762
{\an1}I mean, she was probably
just out of it.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.638
Yeah, she would be.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.098
But then she drove home.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.224
Would they let her do that?

39:12.308 --> 39:13.934
I don't know.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.770
I'm beginning to wonder

39:15.853 --> 39:17.313
{\an3}if she even went through
with this abortion.

39:17.396 --> 39:21.067
I'm beginning to wonder if
Valerie was ever even pregnant.

39:29.575 --> 39:32.078
Help. Somebody save me.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.622
{\an3}(giggling)
Hi. Oh!

39:34.705 --> 39:36.082
A little memento.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.125
{\an1}I can't forget the
first time I saw you,

39:38.209 --> 39:39.835
{\an1}you were holding
a baby fawn in your arms.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.963
Aw, this is so cute.

39:43.047 --> 39:43.964
{\an3}Thank you.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.841
{\an1}Well, it was a toss-up
between this and an eagle.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.344
{\an1}Just read the card.
Okay.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.516
"Dear Donna, this is my address.
Will you write to me?"

39:53.599 --> 39:54.475
Of course I will.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.602
I don't know exactly
when this job will end

39:56.685 --> 39:58.187
and I can't ask you
to wait for me,

39:58.270 --> 39:59.647
but who knows,

39:59.730 --> 40:00.648
I could be back in a few weeks.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.691
I hope so.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.985
Well, um,

40:05.069 --> 40:06.654
I better go.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.988
You have to leave now?

40:08.072 --> 40:11.158
Yeah, I actually do.

40:16.705 --> 40:17.665
Good-bye, Cliff.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.625
Good-bye, Donna.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.562
If politics make
strange bedfellows,

40:39.645 --> 40:41.689
then we certainly know where
America is hashing it out.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.023
Hey, Mark, how much longer?

40:43.107 --> 40:45.192
Uh, we're almost out.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.443
These guys are great.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.237
Yeah, they're quick,
informed, passionate,

40:48.320 --> 40:49.321
and they look
good together.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.823
Don't they, Kel?

40:50.906 --> 40:53.576
Yeah, perfect.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.744
{\an1}If only you could
screen dates the way

40:55.828 --> 40:57.580
{\an1}presidential candidates
screen running mates.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.915
{\an3}That process is hardly
foolproof either, Tracy.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.709
{\an3}Take a look at some
of the vice-presidents

41:01.792 --> 41:04.170
{\an3}we've had to endure,
Dan Quayle et al.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.379
Good point.
Thank you.

41:05.462 --> 41:06.547
It makes me feel
a little better

41:06.630 --> 41:08.090
{\an3}about the guys
I've gone out with.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.551
{\an3}Well, we hope we've helped
to define some of your views.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.512
Whether you see things through a
liberal or conservative filter,

41:13.596 --> 41:15.181
think them through.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.724
And then, take action.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.350
Make yourself heard

41:18.434 --> 41:19.894
{\an3}and stand behind
your beliefs.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.730
{\an1}And join us next
week for CUTV.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.648
I'm Tracy Gaylian.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.400
And I'm Brandon Walsh.

41:26.483 --> 41:28.235
And we're out.

41:28.319 --> 41:29.403
Next week? Next week?

41:29.486 --> 41:31.405
I thought you were quitting.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.073
I changed my mind.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.450
Why?

41:34.533 --> 41:36.785
We vacillators can do that.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.371
{\an1}Besides, how could
I resist working

41:39.455 --> 41:41.415
with someone with
shorts like those?

41:52.176 --> 41:54.637
{\an1}Grandpa never let me drive
this car, you know that?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.639
Yeah, Grandma told me.

41:56.722 --> 41:57.806
I begged, I pleaded.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.100
I threatened to steal it.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.477
He never budged.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.146
It's a great car.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.442
David, I've called off
the legal proceedings.

42:08.525 --> 42:10.444
You changed your mind?

42:10.527 --> 42:12.071
{\an1}I still think my father
made a mistake

42:12.154 --> 42:13.739
{\an1}giving you the money
without any restrictions

42:13.822 --> 42:14.698
or guidelines.

42:14.782 --> 42:17.493
But that's how he loved you,

42:17.576 --> 42:18.661
flat-out, unconditionally,

42:18.744 --> 42:20.120
no questions asked.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.498
So, the money is yours.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.166
{\an3}Thanks.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.417
{\an3}I guess.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.631
Dad?

42:30.714 --> 42:32.424
{\an1}Yeah?

42:32.508 --> 42:35.094
What do you say
we go for a spin?

42:38.055 --> 42:40.057
You drive.
