00:55.900 --> 00:59.690
Mom, check it out.
It glows in the dark.

01:00.107 --> 01:02.254
Stop playing with the lights.

01:02.289 --> 01:05.131
Hello. Will you stop
playing with the lights?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.581
Hi. It's me.

01:06.616 --> 01:10.542
Where do I keep the large casserole dish?
I can't find it anywhere.

01:10.577 --> 01:12.588
Right of the sink,
upper middle cabinet.

01:12.623 --> 01:16.134
Right of the sink?
Upper middle.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.730
No. No. The popcorn
maker's in there.

01:19.765 --> 01:22.448
Look. You can write
secret messages.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.838
You're gonna spill all that.
Take it outside.

01:24.873 --> 01:28.134
- What is?
- The popcorn maker.

01:28.169 --> 01:32.202
- You don't have a popcorn maker.
- I think I do. I'm lookin' right at it.

01:32.237 --> 01:35.915
Adrian. You're in
the wrong house.

01:37.956 --> 01:40.343
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

01:40.378 --> 01:42.392
I am looking at my caller I. D.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.599
Adrian, get out of the house!

01:46.165 --> 01:48.070
Would you put
that phone down, sir?

02:03.551 --> 02:04.825
How you doin'?

02:04.860 --> 02:06.470
You're clear. Go ahead.

02:09.877 --> 02:12.733
Don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.

02:19.170 --> 02:24.080
[Stop] Medford Psychiatric Institute

02:28.926 --> 02:33.716
MONK Season 1 Epi. 05
Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum

03:18.630 --> 03:20.252
You're going to be fine.

03:20.287 --> 03:25.308
They just want to spend 48 hours
with you to observe and evaluate.

03:25.663 --> 03:29.602
Gee, that "B"...it's broken.
Looks like an "R."

03:29.637 --> 03:31.516
- It's all...
- A-Adrian?

03:32.997 --> 03:35.138
Adrian.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.683
You're gonna have to
take this thing seriously.

03:36.718 --> 03:40.381
Judge Hackman says you're lucky
those people didn't press charges...

03:40.416 --> 03:41.982
or shoot you.

03:42.017 --> 03:45.154
Now, the-the director's
name is Morris Lancaster.

03:45.189 --> 03:48.506
He's one of the top
psychiatrists in the country.

03:48.541 --> 03:51.751
Morris Lancaster?
Yeah. He's good.

03:51.786 --> 03:53.696
I saw him on CNN.

03:53.731 --> 03:56.921
- Who's the referring doctor?
- Me. I'm Dr. Kroger.

03:56.956 --> 03:59.777
You need to
sign here and here.

04:00.168 --> 04:02.185
Adrian, he's very good.
He's a very good doctor.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.479
Mr. Monk. How are you?

04:04.514 --> 04:07.065
I don't know. You tell me.

04:08.269 --> 04:11.567
My name is Oliver. I'm gonna
take you to see Dr. Lancaster.

04:11.602 --> 04:13.613
He's anxious to meet you.

04:13.648 --> 04:16.865
Oliver, listen, there's
some things you should know.

04:16.899 --> 04:19.774
I've been taking care
of this man for four years.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.534
These are his moist
towelettes... for germs.

04:24.569 --> 04:28.169
He takes three showers every day
with this star-shaped nozzle.

04:28.204 --> 04:29.891
This is the nozzle.

04:29.926 --> 04:32.987
And he needs a five-watt
night-light for sleeping.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.045
Anything more, he won't sleep.
And dark-colored pillowcases.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.605
- Sharona?
- Nothing light, okay?

04:37.640 --> 04:39.467
- Sharona?
- What?

04:39.502 --> 04:41.395
You're scaring the man.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.979
- No, I'm not.
- Well, you're scaring me.

04:43.014 --> 04:47.303
Ma'am, your friend's in good hands.
I'm going to look after him personally.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.402
You can trust me.

04:50.406 --> 04:52.734
See? I'm gonna be okay.
You're worrying more than I am.

04:52.769 --> 04:55.105
Look, I can't protect
you here, Adrian.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.450
What could happen?
it's a hospital.

04:57.485 --> 05:00.670
This is all gonna be over
before you even know it.

05:18.168 --> 05:21.689
Neurotriptyline, Mr. Monk.

05:21.724 --> 05:24.624
It's a very mild sedative.

05:24.659 --> 05:26.850
It's a little bit like warm milk.

05:26.915 --> 05:28.430
You do drink milk, don't you?

05:28.465 --> 05:31.829
- Never.
- You just have to take my word for it.

05:32.009 --> 05:35.176
I'd rather not take any
medication while I'm here.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.475
- Why do you say that?
- Because I don't need it.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.090
I shouldn't even be here.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.929
I know you... you probably
have heard that before.

05:42.964 --> 05:46.779
Why don't you grab a seat,
and we'll talk about it.

05:52.732 --> 05:55.189
This... is a test, isn't it?

05:55.224 --> 05:56.498
What do you mean?

05:56.533 --> 05:59.011
You want to see
which chair I pick.

05:59.046 --> 06:01.847
No, Adrian, it's not a test.
Just grab a seat.

06:05.214 --> 06:08.248
The left chair. Very interesting.

06:08.283 --> 06:10.736
I'm just kidding.
Relax. It's just a joke.

06:12.428 --> 06:15.109
That's a marlin, isn't it?

06:15.144 --> 06:19.535
That's right. It's one of two things
I managed to catch in Mexico in '97.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.805
- What was the other?
- Dysentery.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.974
What about last week?
Did you catch anything?

06:24.009 --> 06:28.733
Pardon me? - You just got
back from another fishing trip.

06:28.768 --> 06:33.804
You were in South America,
unless I'm wrong, which, you know, I'm not.

06:33.839 --> 06:36.828
I was in Argentina,
but how did you know all that?

06:36.863 --> 06:40.187
You have needle marks on your arm.
It's obviously an inoculation.

06:40.222 --> 06:43.160
And your "In"box is pretty full.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.988
And South America?

06:45.023 --> 06:49.157
The Customs seal on the cigar box.
It's dated last week.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.120
But how did you know it
was specifically a fishing trip?

06:51.155 --> 06:53.285
You have a blister...

06:53.320 --> 06:57.142
on the index finger of your right
hand just above the knuckle.

06:57.452 --> 06:59.897
On most fishing rods,

06:59.932 --> 07:04.180
the line chafes the index finger
just above the knuckle.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.750
Well, that's very impressive.

07:05.785 --> 07:07.368
We both have similar jobs.

07:07.403 --> 07:10.864
We both analyze clues
and solve problems.

07:10.899 --> 07:13.017
Only you look outward,
and I look inward.

07:13.052 --> 07:15.397
So, now it's my turn. So, sit.

07:17.943 --> 07:23.581
What were you doing...
in Trudy's old house yesterday?

07:23.616 --> 07:27.979
- Your late wife lived there for...
- Yeah, I-I don't know why I go there.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.723
Well, I'm gonna hazard a guess.

07:29.758 --> 07:34.080
I think you went there yesterday
to cook Trudy dinner.

07:34.115 --> 07:36.086
To cook Tr...

07:36.121 --> 07:37.826
Well, that's absurd.

07:37.861 --> 07:40.084
Your file says that you're
allergic to tomatoes.

07:40.119 --> 07:43.172
So the chicken cacciatore
was for her, wasn't it?

07:43.207 --> 07:45.488
And I'll bet you it was
her favorite meal.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.925
That's right.

07:49.946 --> 07:51.556
That's right.

07:52.298 --> 07:56.123
So... So, um, what was so
significant about yesterday?

07:56.158 --> 07:59.075
- No-Nothing.
- August 12.

08:00.006 --> 08:03.182
Unless I'm wrong...
which, you know, I'm not...

08:03.217 --> 08:05.650
The date has some significance.

08:06.111 --> 08:10.307
Our anniversary.
Not our wedding anniversary.

08:10.342 --> 08:14.005
It was the day we met.
It was the day we met.

08:14.362 --> 08:19.224
You know, it's not unhealthy or
wrong to observe an anniversary,

08:19.259 --> 08:22.647
but we're gonna find a way
for you to do it privately.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.760
Would that be okay?

08:24.795 --> 08:27.539
Yes, please.

08:27.574 --> 08:31.233
I think that your analytical powers,
they're dazzling.

08:31.268 --> 08:33.544
But I think you use
them as a prop.

08:33.578 --> 08:37.071
A prop? - As a way to avoid
dealing with your real problems.

08:37.106 --> 08:40.332
So, while you're here,
do me a favor...

08:40.368 --> 08:42.587
don't be a detective.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.533
Let me be the detective. Okay?

08:51.437 --> 08:53.141
Yes, sir.

08:55.091 --> 08:57.197
Here's the bathroom.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.973
You mean it's
a communal bathroom?

09:01.336 --> 09:03.557
Every-Everyone uses it?

09:03.592 --> 09:05.732
You got a problem with that?

09:06.782 --> 09:08.556
No. No.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.406
This is you.

09:22.185 --> 09:23.672
Here's your schedule.

09:23.707 --> 09:25.659
The events underlined
are not optional.

09:25.694 --> 09:28.609
They're mandatory.
It means you have to go.

09:28.644 --> 09:30.699
I know what "mandatory" means.

09:30.734 --> 09:33.143
Lights out at 9:00.
Any questions?

09:33.178 --> 09:34.655
Can I make a phone call?

09:34.690 --> 09:37.478
You're allowed one
outgoing phone call every day.

09:37.513 --> 09:39.513
Your time starts 11:25 a. m.

09:39.548 --> 09:41.741
If you're late, you're gonna
have to wait till tomorrow.

09:42.132 --> 09:44.278
Do you want
the door open or shut?

09:44.313 --> 09:45.485
Shut.

09:47.563 --> 09:49.218
Uh, open.

09:49.253 --> 09:51.091
No. Wait.

09:51.126 --> 09:53.713
Shu... Shut. Shut.

09:53.808 --> 09:55.619
No. Op-Op... Op-Op...

09:55.654 --> 09:57.611
Definitely open. Just open.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.330
Definitely open. Open.

10:09.325 --> 10:11.319
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

10:11.354 --> 10:12.623
I'm John.

10:12.658 --> 10:15.760
- Adrian Monk.
- Guess we're roommates then.

10:17.046 --> 10:18.740
What are you in for?

10:19.634 --> 10:21.082
Just...

10:21.117 --> 10:22.519
Just observation really.

10:22.554 --> 10:24.494
Likewise.
Observation and evaluation.

10:24.529 --> 10:27.059
The old O and E.
Seventy-two hours?

10:27.094 --> 10:28.784
- Forty-eight.
- Yeah. Me too.

10:28.819 --> 10:31.117
Just got here myself
yesterday morning.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.263
So, what do you do
for a living, Mr. Monk?

10:33.298 --> 10:35.257
I'm a... I'm a detective.

10:37.190 --> 10:39.860
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

10:39.895 --> 10:41.673
That's what I do.
I'm a detective.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.943
- Really?
- Seven years, Sonoma County.

10:43.978 --> 10:46.398
Lieutenant, second-grade. Homicide.

10:46.702 --> 10:47.877
Really?

10:47.912 --> 10:50.284
This is unbelievable.

10:50.319 --> 10:54.310
That's a lot of laundry for a guy
who just got here yesterday.

10:55.886 --> 10:57.481
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.484
Come on.
Let me give you a grand tour.

11:03.149 --> 11:05.351
The cafeteria closes at 7:00.

11:05.386 --> 11:07.280
It's buffet-style.

11:08.002 --> 11:10.063
This is the Music Room.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.522
And if you go through
these doors, down the hall,

11:12.557 --> 11:14.153
that'll take you to the infirmary.

11:17.028 --> 11:18.431
This is the Monkey Room.

11:18.466 --> 11:20.336
Funny story about
how it got its name.

11:20.371 --> 11:21.342
What is it?

11:21.377 --> 11:24.379
We don't know.
We just know there's a funny story.

11:26.463 --> 11:28.170
What's all this?

11:28.205 --> 11:30.557
They're tearing down the old walls.
They're bringin' it up to code.

11:30.592 --> 11:33.753
It's a pretty big project.
I used to be in construction myself.

11:33.788 --> 11:36.395
- Before you became a cop.
- Exactly.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.158
Yeah.

11:38.588 --> 11:40.522
Who's this?

11:41.041 --> 11:44.117
This is Doris Medford.
She was the first director here.

11:44.152 --> 11:46.220
These are all the other directors.

11:46.255 --> 11:47.354
Dead.

11:47.886 --> 11:49.077
Dead.

11:49.112 --> 11:50.183
Dead.

11:50.218 --> 11:52.120
Not dead... yet.

11:52.381 --> 11:54.812
- Hello, Wurster.
- Torch.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.046
She burned her
boyfriend's house down.

12:02.298 --> 12:03.928
This is the Quiet Room.

12:03.963 --> 12:06.099
Don't get sent here.

12:13.672 --> 12:15.717
Oh, boy.

12:16.088 --> 12:17.717
What's this?

12:17.893 --> 12:20.106
This is the Medical Supply Room.

12:20.141 --> 12:22.156
Gives me the creeps.

12:22.191 --> 12:23.924
Why?

12:23.959 --> 12:25.823
There was a murder here.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.354
Oh, really? A murder?

12:28.389 --> 12:30.471
An unsolved murder.

12:30.506 --> 12:32.575
Conrad Gould,
the assistant director,

12:32.610 --> 12:36.913
well, he was killed right
here four years ago.

12:38.497 --> 12:41.611
He was a great guy.
Gave me magazines.

12:41.646 --> 12:43.612
Playboys.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.337
- Right.
- Hey.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.950
Hey, maybe we can
solve it together, huh?

12:47.985 --> 12:50.674
Yeah, sure. Great.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.548
What... What happened exactly?

12:54.845 --> 12:58.434
Well, Dr. Gould was taking inventory,
like he did every night.

12:58.469 --> 13:01.649
A patient named Bill
LaFrankie was waiting for him.

13:01.684 --> 13:03.271
Hey.

13:04.962 --> 13:08.712
Capped him in the chest.
Then he fled S. O. C.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.327
"S. O. C."?

13:10.362 --> 13:12.981
Yeah. "Scene of the crime."
It's cop talk.

13:14.831 --> 13:17.128
They found him in the woods
the next morning.

13:17.163 --> 13:20.110
He was dead.
He shot himself up with Demerol.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.232
Uh, I'm a little confused.

13:22.267 --> 13:25.500
Why would you call
it an unsolved murder?

13:25.535 --> 13:29.167
Well, I wasn't 100% satisfied
with the official version.

13:29.202 --> 13:30.429
- You weren't?
- No, sir.

13:30.464 --> 13:32.144
They never found
the gun, first of all.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.390
Plus, Bill LaFrankie
was my roommate.

13:34.425 --> 13:36.789
He was a devout Buddhist.
He wouldn't hurt a spider.

13:36.824 --> 13:39.743
Speaking of spiders, there was a guy here
named Jim Robertello

13:39.778 --> 13:41.729
about two... two years ago.

13:41.764 --> 13:44.294
No. About three years ago.

13:44.329 --> 13:45.726
No, no, no. Two years...

13:45.761 --> 13:47.693
Two or three...
About two and a half years ago maybe.

13:47.728 --> 13:50.413
It doesn't really matter. - It doesn't really
matter how many years ago it was.

13:50.448 --> 13:52.825
But he had a spider named
Jesse... Jesse the spider.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.742
And Jesse... Every time you played a Willie
Nelson record, he would start dancing.

13:55.777 --> 13:57.615
He'd get into it. Fabulous dancer.
Cha-cha... He'd get all his arms...

13:57.650 --> 13:59.551
What's goin' on?

13:59.630 --> 14:03.297
Oh. Hey, Oliver. - This is a restricted
area, Wurster. You know that.

14:03.332 --> 14:05.262
I was just telling
Mr. Monk about Dr. Gould.

14:05.297 --> 14:09.515
That's ancient history.
Mr. Monk has enough problems.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.866
You're late.
Time for art therapy.

14:15.668 --> 14:17.430
Hey, fellas. Carry on.

14:18.344 --> 14:20.416
Remember, this is supposed
to be a self-portrait.

14:20.451 --> 14:23.386
How do you feel about yourself?

14:23.421 --> 14:25.494
Look deep inside.
There's no right or wrong.

14:26.639 --> 14:27.993
It's a little erogenous.
Very good. I love those eyes.

14:28.028 --> 14:31.125
Excuse me, Doctor.
Is there a sink nearby?

14:31.160 --> 14:33.282
I... I need to wash up.

14:33.317 --> 14:34.597
Will you shut him up!

14:34.632 --> 14:37.147
He has been whining
since he walked in here.

14:37.182 --> 14:40.056
"It's too hot. It's too cold.
I have charcoal on my hands!"

14:40.091 --> 14:43.053
Jane, what did
we talk about yesterday?

14:43.538 --> 14:45.564
Controlling the urge to lash out.

14:45.599 --> 14:48.116
Do you have something
you wanna say to Mr. Monk?

14:49.143 --> 14:50.401
Sorry.

14:50.436 --> 14:52.965
That's okay. I do have a little
charcoal on my hands.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.230
Dr. Lancaster,

14:54.265 --> 14:56.228
Dr. Lancaster,
guess what I'm painting.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.358
- Santa Claus!
- All right, all right.

15:01.054 --> 15:04.517
Well, you know this is
supposed to be a self-portrait.

15:04.552 --> 15:07.816
- That's me.
- Why are you so small?

15:08.148 --> 15:11.041
Everybody's small
compared to Santa.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.122
He actually sits up every
night and waits for him.

15:14.157 --> 15:17.831
I have a feeling he's on his way.
It's definitely getting colder outside.

15:17.866 --> 15:20.613
It's August, whack job!

15:27.375 --> 15:29.599
Is there a problem, Mr. Monk?

15:29.634 --> 15:32.663
I'm having a little
trouble getting started.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.113
Do you know why?

15:36.241 --> 15:39.258
Maybe it's because you're
afraid it won't be perfect.

15:39.695 --> 15:43.222
And you're right. It won't be perfect.
Not everything is going to be perfect.

15:43.257 --> 15:45.758
But, come on. Why don't
you just draw something?

15:45.793 --> 15:48.403
I've only got you for 48 hours.

16:03.669 --> 16:05.233
I like it.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.992
How does it feel?

16:09.027 --> 16:11.459
It feels good.

16:41.135 --> 16:43.490
Into the Quiet Room!
She's gonna need more meds!

16:44.133 --> 16:47.610
Call Dr. Lancaster and tell him
that Jane's losing it!

16:47.645 --> 16:49.377
Try his cell phone!

17:16.682 --> 17:19.108
Santa.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.803
I went to the Stop & Shop,

17:29.838 --> 17:33.747
but instead of walking
home up Divisadero street,

17:33.782 --> 17:36.537
I... I turned left...

17:36.572 --> 17:40.574
and I walked down Trudy's
old street to her house.

17:40.609 --> 17:44.043
Door was open,
so I walked in.

17:45.473 --> 17:48.530
And how did you feel
being in the house again?

17:48.773 --> 17:51.735
Content, not a care in the world.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.506
Adrian, when did this urge
begin to manifest itself?

17:54.541 --> 17:57.465
John, I'll run the therapy
session today, okay?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.741
Fair enough. - And later,
you and I can talk privately.

17:59.776 --> 18:03.468
About Monk? - No. About your
tendency to over-empathize.

18:03.591 --> 18:05.561
I feel like I'm back
in medical school again.

18:05.596 --> 18:07.395
Dr. Lancaster,
can I go next?

18:07.430 --> 18:09.028
Just a minute.
Just a minute, okay?

18:09.063 --> 18:10.651
Go ahead.

18:10.816 --> 18:14.224
I, uh, I really feel sorry
for the Haskells.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.875
Who are the Haskells?

18:17.146 --> 18:18.502
Who are the Haskells?

18:18.537 --> 18:21.419
The couple that live
in the house.

18:21.454 --> 18:25.029
Nick and Josie.
Sweet people, and, uh,

18:25.064 --> 18:27.535
I...

18:27.720 --> 18:31.529
My wife had a necklace
exactly like that.

18:31.564 --> 18:34.291
Well, I'm not giving it to you
if that's what you're getting at.

18:34.326 --> 18:37.808
Dr. Lancaster,
can I please go next?

18:39.514 --> 18:42.807
Last night, I saw Santa Claus.

18:43.226 --> 18:44.888
All right. I'm sure we'd all like
to hear about it. Go ahead.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.185
Okay.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.329
It was around 4:00.

18:48.364 --> 18:50.478
I was asleep in my room.

18:50.513 --> 18:52.742
I heard sounds outside.

18:52.777 --> 18:55.238
They were footsteps on the roof.

18:55.273 --> 18:58.772
And I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter.

19:00.168 --> 19:03.055
It was him,
as big as life.

19:03.090 --> 19:06.527
He was standing by the big chimney
getting ready to slide down.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.587
Then...

19:08.622 --> 19:10.839
his cell phone rang.

19:11.196 --> 19:14.195
His cell phone?

19:14.300 --> 19:17.184
He answered it, and then
he started talking to somebody.

19:17.219 --> 19:20.442
It's true. I can prove it.
I took his picture.

19:20.477 --> 19:21.536
You-You took some pictures?

19:21.571 --> 19:24.598
Yeah. I always keep
my camera by the window.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.498
I'm sure we'd all like to see them
when they get developed.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.981
And who's next?

19:31.243 --> 19:33.027
Well, that's not a pair.

19:33.062 --> 19:37.328
Actually, that's a jack,
and this is a king.

19:39.934 --> 19:41.922
Close enough.

19:43.461 --> 19:46.490
- What are you looking for?
- My camera.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.015
I put it down right there.
I know I did.

19:50.050 --> 19:55.333
Manny, what time did you see,
you know, Santa Claus last night?

19:55.368 --> 19:57.223
3:47 a. m. Exactly.

19:57.258 --> 19:59.671
I made a note.

20:00.258 --> 20:02.655
You wanna see
where I saw him?

20:04.543 --> 20:06.862
Everyone thinks it's
just a children's story.

20:06.897 --> 20:10.539
Of course, the Macy's Parade guy and
the department store Santas are actors.

20:10.574 --> 20:11.733
I'm not an idiot.

20:11.768 --> 20:16.394
But there have been over 400
documented sightings of Saint Nicholas...

20:16.429 --> 20:18.994
scientifically documented.

20:19.029 --> 20:22.034
It's on the Internet,
so you know it's true.

20:23.402 --> 20:25.508
Look.

20:25.535 --> 20:27.703
That's an actual picture.

20:27.738 --> 20:30.741
Well, Manny,
that could be anything.

20:30.776 --> 20:33.105
It's Santa Claus.

20:35.148 --> 20:38.282
- What happened here?
- Mr. Richter.

20:38.317 --> 20:39.893
He didn't wanna move.

20:39.928 --> 20:42.759
He had this room before me.
He put up a big fight.

20:42.794 --> 20:45.502
- This happened recently?
- Last week.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.864
I've been on the waiting list
for this room for 11 years.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.792
Last week, Dr. Lancaster
said I could have it.

20:53.379 --> 20:55.518
I wish I had my camera.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.078
I had real proof.

20:58.214 --> 21:01.288
This... This is where
you saw him, huh?

21:02.538 --> 21:04.722
He was standing...

21:04.757 --> 21:07.224
right over there.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.715
And then his cell phone rang.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.438
He answered it, and then he went
back that way out of sight.

21:12.473 --> 21:13.651
What's that?

21:13.686 --> 21:15.487
- Where?
- On the chimney.

21:15.522 --> 21:19.177
It looks like a rag
or a piece of cloth.

21:21.206 --> 21:23.003
Manny, just don't fall.

21:23.038 --> 21:25.322
Falling is bad.
You know that, right?

21:26.409 --> 21:27.845
Be careful.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.283
There's a lot of, you know,
gravity out there.

21:32.688 --> 21:34.096
Can you reach it?

21:34.131 --> 21:36.031
I think so.

21:37.550 --> 21:40.704
Okay, Manny.
Look around.

21:40.739 --> 21:43.525
Are there any footprints?

21:44.227 --> 21:47.459
- I see mine.
- Besides yours.

21:48.365 --> 21:51.453
Yes! They're all over.

21:51.488 --> 21:53.708
He was here!

21:56.288 --> 21:59.066
This is proof, isn't it?
This is evidence.

21:59.101 --> 22:02.322
Oh, I can't wait till my next session.
This'll shut 'em up.

22:02.357 --> 22:06.269
Actually, Manny, I think we should probably
keep this just between you and me.

22:06.304 --> 22:07.492
No. Why?

22:07.527 --> 22:10.279
Well, maybe we'll find more proof.

22:10.314 --> 22:13.630
And then they'll have to believe us.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.976
- Fine.
- Good.

22:16.055 --> 22:18.275
And by the way, Manny,

22:18.310 --> 22:21.541
were you here when
Dr. Gould was murdered?

22:21.576 --> 22:22.642
Oh, yeah.

22:22.677 --> 22:24.861
They quoted me
in the newspaper.

22:24.896 --> 22:26.439
I'll show you.

22:30.862 --> 22:33.261
I saved all the articles.

22:33.999 --> 22:38.387
"An unidentified patient stated
that Dr. Gould was very popular...

22:38.422 --> 22:40.418
and would be greatly missed."

22:40.600 --> 22:44.434
Uh-huh. That's me...
the "unidentified patient."

22:49.369 --> 22:54.482
This table needs to move
over here, out of the way.

22:54.985 --> 22:56.461
Perfect.

22:56.496 --> 23:00.667
- Okay, this is the medical closet.
- That's the arts and crafts closet.

23:00.702 --> 23:04.422
I know, but we're pretending
it's the medical closest.

23:04.457 --> 23:06.518
That's the arts and crafts closet.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.135
Okay, Manny,
you're Dr. Gould.

23:09.170 --> 23:13.853
You're making your rounds.
You're coming down the hall.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.653
He used to clean
his ear, remember?

23:18.939 --> 23:21.511
You enter the Supply Room.

23:21.546 --> 23:23.544
There's the cabinet.

23:23.579 --> 23:25.193
You unlock it.

23:27.589 --> 23:29.688
Okay, Johnny,
you're Bill LaFrankie. - Yeah.

23:29.723 --> 23:32.103
You're looking
to steal some drugs. - Yeah.

23:32.138 --> 23:34.435
You sneak up on the doctor.

23:36.135 --> 23:38.123
And...

23:38.158 --> 23:39.144
Bang. - Bang.

23:39.179 --> 23:41.062
Bang.

23:41.364 --> 23:43.468
And Dr. Gould is dead.

23:46.044 --> 23:49.608
LaFrankie goes to steal the drugs.

23:51.339 --> 23:53.093
And you run away.

23:53.128 --> 23:54.915
Run away.

24:00.796 --> 24:03.074
Okay.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.395
Let me think.

24:16.107 --> 24:18.276
The keys.

24:19.431 --> 24:23.022
Manny left the keys
in the door...

24:23.064 --> 24:27.157
Which is what
anybody would do.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.595
But look at the picture.

24:31.647 --> 24:34.633
Look at where the keys are.

24:34.668 --> 24:38.881
The keys are still
in the doctor's pocket.

24:39.750 --> 24:43.350
I don't think he ever
opened the locker.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.371
Maybe...

24:45.406 --> 24:48.135
LaFrankie shot him,

24:48.593 --> 24:52.960
took his keys
and then opened it.

24:53.888 --> 24:56.609
Why would an addict
desperate for drugs...

24:56.644 --> 24:59.970
return the keys to
the doctor's pocket?

25:00.005 --> 25:02.555
I don't think LaFrankie did it.

25:02.788 --> 25:05.630
I think the killer had his own keys.

25:05.665 --> 25:07.842
You mean he worked here?

25:08.835 --> 25:10.655
What's going on?

25:12.205 --> 25:14.805
They're killing Dr. Gould.

25:26.729 --> 25:28.896
Now listen to me, Mr. Monk.

25:28.931 --> 25:32.336
Not only was Dr. Gould my colleague,

25:32.371 --> 25:34.631
he was my best friend.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.150
And I do not appreciate
you joking about it.

25:37.185 --> 25:39.540
I wasn't joking.

25:39.575 --> 25:41.497
Do you know what a delusion is?

25:41.532 --> 25:46.974
It's a false belief sustained despite
clear evidence to the contrary.

25:47.009 --> 25:48.938
The fishing line.

25:48.973 --> 25:50.515
Pardon me? What?

25:51.552 --> 25:54.500
There was a fishing line in this rod.

25:54.535 --> 25:56.941
- Where did it go?
- What do you think happened to it?

25:56.976 --> 25:59.105
You think I used it to strangle
somebody on the ward?

25:59.140 --> 26:00.294
Dr. Lancaster!

26:00.329 --> 26:02.910
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I heard he was in here.

26:02.945 --> 26:04.490
Where is it?

26:04.525 --> 26:08.610
What? - You know what. My necklace,
the one you said reminded you of your wife.

26:08.645 --> 26:11.158
- He stole it. I know he did.
- This is ridiculous.

26:11.193 --> 26:13.831
I took it off in the infirmary.
That's the last time I had it.

26:13.866 --> 26:16.763
- You were in there!
- There's a simple way to solve this.

26:16.798 --> 26:18.732
Adrian, empty your pockets.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.348
Oh, my God.

26:29.383 --> 26:31.949
Thank you very much!

26:32.428 --> 26:34.438
How did that get there?

26:35.370 --> 26:40.014
I swear I...
don't remember taking it.

26:40.049 --> 26:42.356
I know you don't. I know.

26:45.307 --> 26:47.844
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

26:48.001 --> 26:50.704
I was just like you
when I got here.

26:51.254 --> 26:54.226
I was seeing things
that weren't there.

26:54.929 --> 27:01.014
The night Dr. Gould was murdered,
I saw Bill LaFrankie running with a gun.

27:02.279 --> 27:04.232
You did?

27:04.532 --> 27:06.867
I was trying to get
to a pay phone.

27:06.902 --> 27:09.446
But in my mind,

27:09.481 --> 27:13.171
I saw Dr. Lancaster with the gun,

27:15.440 --> 27:18.242
like I was...

27:18.432 --> 27:24.136
projecting my rage for
Dr. Lancaster onto Bill LaFrankie.

27:24.304 --> 27:26.441
I see.

27:26.829 --> 27:30.705
Dr. Lancaster was trying
to help me. I resented him.

27:32.732 --> 27:34.579
Me too.

27:34.614 --> 27:36.698
Welcome to my world.

27:40.680 --> 27:44.064
Time for your medication, Mr. Monk.
Dr. Lancaster's orders.

27:49.933 --> 27:52.499
I'm slipping away.

27:52.534 --> 27:54.790
What's wrong with me?

27:54.825 --> 27:57.663
Hold on, Monk.
Hold on.

28:01.245 --> 28:03.865
If anything, his behavior
has deteriorated.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.896
We may have to keep him
here longer than we thought.

28:05.931 --> 28:08.714
- Well, how much longer?
- That's hard to say. It could be a month.

28:08.749 --> 28:11.793
A month? - It could be
as long as a year.

28:11.828 --> 28:16.103
Adrian is bipolar,
he's delusional and he's paranoid.

28:16.138 --> 28:19.670
He sees murder mysteries
everywhere he turns.

28:19.705 --> 28:21.277
In fact, he's befriended
another patient,

28:21.312 --> 28:25.065
and the two of them are trying to prove
that Santa Claus really does exist.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.075
Santa Claus?

28:26.110 --> 28:28.164
They went out on the roof
collecting evidence.

28:28.199 --> 28:30.941
It would be funny if it wasn't so...
dysfunctional.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.180
Adrian, look who's here.

28:34.784 --> 28:37.382
Hey, boss.

28:38.023 --> 28:41.321
- How you feelin'?
- Ah, I feel good.

28:41.356 --> 28:44.737
I can't...
I can't wait to get home.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.623
Well, we were just
talking about that.

28:47.658 --> 28:49.259
Adrian, would you mind
if I showed your friend

28:49.294 --> 28:52.146
some of the artwork
that you made yesterday?

28:55.167 --> 28:56.358
Oh, here it is.

28:56.393 --> 28:57.680
Wait a minute.

29:03.071 --> 29:04.801
Did I draw that?

29:04.836 --> 29:07.166
You don't remember?

29:07.321 --> 29:10.333
Isn't that Trudy's grave?

29:11.718 --> 29:16.193
Dr. Lancaster said
that you saw Santa Claus.

29:17.271 --> 29:21.263
No, we didn't actually see him.

29:21.298 --> 29:24.128
Manny took a picture,
but he lost the camera.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.717
But we found a piece of a...

29:26.752 --> 29:29.114
red suit.

29:29.149 --> 29:31.321
We'd love to see it, Adrian.

29:32.406 --> 29:34.736
It was in here.

29:35.612 --> 29:38.894
It was here.
It was in here.

29:38.929 --> 29:42.529
A little piece of fabric,
you know, of Santa's...

29:42.564 --> 29:44.649
Santa's, you know, suit.

29:44.684 --> 29:46.715
Okay. No, no.

29:46.928 --> 29:50.996
It was a piece of... fabric, and...

29:51.663 --> 29:53.175
Doctor?

29:53.210 --> 29:57.036
- Can I talk to you privately? - Sure.
- Like... Santa's suit.

29:59.577 --> 30:02.702
He's not himself.
He needs me.

30:02.737 --> 30:05.397
Look, I could be here two,
three times a week, okay?

30:05.432 --> 30:07.769
I still have my license.
Maybe they can give me a job here.

30:07.804 --> 30:10.381
Sharona, I know you
mean well, but the less

30:10.382 --> 30:13.310
contact Adrian has with
his old life, the better.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.808
You can write him a letter.
You can bring him something from home.

30:15.843 --> 30:18.876
I'm sure he'd like that,
but no visits.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.157
Look, Adrian...

30:27.516 --> 30:31.610
I... Listen, I... I can't
take you home right now.

30:31.645 --> 30:35.806
Sharona, look at his shoes.
Just look at his shoes.

30:36.366 --> 30:38.888
They're smudged.

30:38.923 --> 30:40.654
Could be soot.

30:40.689 --> 30:42.645
Those are boat shoes.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.108
They're made for traction.

30:45.503 --> 30:49.256
And I think he has been
walkin' on the roof.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.336
Adrian,

30:51.371 --> 30:54.058
just try to listen to
Dr. Lancaster, okay?

30:54.093 --> 30:55.400
He's a good man.

30:55.435 --> 30:59.073
There was a doctor murdered
here about four years ago... - Adrian,

30:59.108 --> 31:01.015
- will you calm down?
- Named Gould. Conrad Gould.

31:01.050 --> 31:03.487
Please try and stay calm and sit.

31:03.522 --> 31:05.170
Just relax.

31:05.653 --> 31:11.531
I think... I think Lancaster had
something to do with it.

31:11.749 --> 31:15.500
Am I... losing my mind?

31:48.909 --> 31:51.705
Medical Library

31:53.767 --> 31:56.635
- Excuse me.
- One second.

31:59.939 --> 32:01.521
Hi.

32:01.556 --> 32:05.527
I'm told that Dr. Conrad Gould
left all of his papers to your library,

32:05.562 --> 32:08.835
and I need to see
his journals from 1998.

32:08.870 --> 32:10.593
Do you have an I. D.?

32:11.355 --> 32:13.413
Not on me. I left it in my car.

32:13.448 --> 32:16.184
- I can look you up.
- Uh, well...

32:16.279 --> 32:17.604
Here's the thing.

32:17.639 --> 32:20.628
I'm not actually enrolled
here at the present time.

32:20.663 --> 32:22.921
Well, the library's
for students only.

32:22.956 --> 32:24.364
Really?

32:32.349 --> 32:35.015
Is there a Chet that works here?

32:35.050 --> 32:38.516
- I'm Chet.
- Oh, my God. This is so funny.

32:38.551 --> 32:40.498
I was told to ask for you.

32:40.533 --> 32:45.013
See, I met this guy at a party
who said that you were really cool...

32:45.048 --> 32:49.187
and that you would let me do
a little research here as a favor.

32:49.222 --> 32:51.991
Uh, what guy?

32:52.026 --> 32:54.158
He was, um...

32:54.193 --> 32:57.493
Oh, he was tall,
wore glasses.

32:57.528 --> 32:59.324
- Ross Kelton?
- That's right.

32:59.359 --> 33:03.388
- That's right. Ross Kelton.
- Ross Kelton said I was cool?

33:03.423 --> 33:05.435
Was he wrong?

33:07.248 --> 33:09.663
You wanted Gould's
personal journals, right?

33:11.214 --> 33:13.799
Mind if I ask what for?

33:13.969 --> 33:16.199
Ross said you were cool.

33:16.234 --> 33:18.290
Uh, right. Right. Sorry.

33:29.623 --> 33:32.784
"Dr. Murdock has assured me that
I am next in line for the directorship,

33:32.819 --> 33:36.467
a decision bound to be met
with anger and derision by Dr..."

33:36.502 --> 33:38.414
Oh, my God.

33:40.335 --> 33:42.563
Is it okay if he has
a picture of Trudy?

33:42.598 --> 33:44.397
Maybe it'll calm him down.

33:54.578 --> 33:56.285
I think he'll like that.
Here you go.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.498
Thanks. Nice to see you.

33:57.533 --> 33:59.091
- Thank you very much.
- You bet. Thank you.

33:59.126 --> 34:00.792
- I'll see you soon.
- I hope so.

34:03.215 --> 34:06.377
Sometimes I wish I'd joined
the Rolling Stones when they asked me.

34:06.438 --> 34:08.205
Lights out!

34:16.572 --> 34:18.507
Hey, check it out.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.929
Monk, you're not crazy.

34:25.321 --> 34:27.076
What's it say?

34:27.377 --> 34:29.799
You're in danger!
Get out!

34:30.938 --> 34:33.588
It says I'm not crazy.

34:33.623 --> 34:35.672
Anything there about me?

35:07.826 --> 35:09.993
What the hell?

35:10.905 --> 35:12.150
There you are.

35:12.185 --> 35:14.759
I warned you not to play
detective in my hospital.

35:14.794 --> 35:16.130
This is Bill LaFrankie's file.

35:16.165 --> 35:18.354
There's no way this man
killed himself like they said.

35:18.389 --> 35:19.661
He's in here!

35:19.696 --> 35:23.102
He suffered from belonephobia.
He had a pathological fear of needles.

35:23.137 --> 35:24.783
You're a smart man.

35:24.818 --> 35:28.638
Let's see what kind of witness
you are with a functioning I. Q of 17.

35:28.673 --> 35:30.785
Mr. Monk came here
to try to kill me. - What? Wait.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.948
I think he needs some time
in the Quiet Room, Oliver.

35:32.983 --> 35:34.993
- No. Wait!
- It's for your own good, Adrian.

36:05.489 --> 36:08.412
- How much?
- Two c. c.'s of Thorazine.

36:08.447 --> 36:11.041
- Make it four.
- Four?

36:11.076 --> 36:14.146
Are you sure? He can't
weigh more than 160 pounds.

36:14.181 --> 36:17.367
Did you just graduate from medical
school in the last 45 minutes?

36:17.402 --> 36:19.383
No, sir. - Then do
what the hell you're told.

36:19.418 --> 36:21.919
Give this patient
four c. c. 's of Thorazine.

36:21.954 --> 36:24.054
I gotta go upstairs
and get some more.

36:24.089 --> 36:25.789
Make it quick.

37:49.862 --> 37:51.699
What the hell?

37:51.734 --> 37:53.012
Hey!

38:01.767 --> 38:02.738
Hello?

38:02.773 --> 38:05.105
I know who did it, Sharona.
I can prove it.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.240
Call the police.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.064
I borrowed Mr. Carruthers's camera.

38:10.099 --> 38:13.691
It has eight pictures left.
See the numbers?

38:13.880 --> 38:16.094
Is Santa really coming?

38:16.129 --> 38:18.086
Oh, yeah, he'll be here.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.453
What do you want for Christmas?

38:21.683 --> 38:25.109
I just want two and two
to be four again.

38:27.366 --> 38:30.021
It's him! Santa Claus!

38:30.056 --> 38:32.379
I knew it.

38:34.090 --> 38:35.945
Well, what's he doing?

38:35.980 --> 38:38.669
- He's going fishing.
- For what?

38:38.952 --> 38:40.393
The gun, Manny.

38:40.428 --> 38:43.995
He has to find it before the
construction crew stumbles onto it.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.869
Then he'll get rid of it for good, and
I'll never be able to prove any of this.

38:46.904 --> 38:50.410
- I love you, Santa!
- Manny.

38:50.837 --> 38:53.174
Manny. Manny, no. No.

38:53.209 --> 38:57.025
No. No. Stay here.
I need you to take pictures.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.968
I don't understand
what he's doing.

39:07.859 --> 39:10.797
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

39:14.122 --> 39:15.877
How's the fishing, Doctor?

39:15.912 --> 39:18.466
Monk. How did you get up here?

39:18.501 --> 39:20.314
Santa Claus!

39:21.139 --> 39:23.714
This is why you put
Manny in that room,

39:23.749 --> 39:26.956
'cause you knew you could
spend all night up here...

39:26.991 --> 39:30.317
and nobody would ever believe
he really did see Santa Claus.

39:30.352 --> 39:32.545
Nobody but you, Monk,

39:32.580 --> 39:35.580
and who's gonna believe you?
You're clinically insane, remember?

39:35.615 --> 39:39.480
We'll find the gun, Doctor,
right where you dropped it.

39:39.515 --> 39:41.689
And that's all the proof I'll need.

39:43.156 --> 39:44.805
You couldn't stand it.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.198
The board of directors
gave your job to Dr. Gould.

39:48.406 --> 39:50.403
- You killed him.
- Dr. Gould.

39:54.156 --> 39:58.086
You stole some drugs to
make it look like a patient did it.

39:58.434 --> 40:02.246
You needed a fall guy.
LaFrankie fit the bill.

40:02.281 --> 40:04.342
You probably got
LaFrankie all doped up,

40:04.377 --> 40:07.935
then lured him into the woods
where the cops found him the next day.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.990
You only had one problem...
the murder weapon.

40:11.025 --> 40:13.204
It was registered in your name.

40:13.239 --> 40:15.738
You had to get rid of the gun
before the cops showed up.

40:15.773 --> 40:18.579
And you found
the perfect place to hide it.

40:18.614 --> 40:19.507
Hey!

40:19.542 --> 40:21.407
You can't talk to
Santa Claus like that.

40:21.442 --> 40:23.506
Manny. Manny!

40:24.934 --> 40:28.074
- Santa! Help me!
- Well, well, well. What have we here?

40:28.109 --> 40:31.492
Manny, hang on.
Just hang on.

40:32.169 --> 40:33.997
Wait a minute.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.250
You're not really Santa Claus.

40:36.285 --> 40:39.077
Monk, be careful!
He's not really Santa Claus.

40:43.164 --> 40:45.816
Gun's been lodged in
that chimney for four years.

40:47.135 --> 40:50.316
I'm guessing the chamber
and the metal firing pin...

40:50.351 --> 40:51.986
are completely oxidized.

40:52.210 --> 40:53.480
Oh, look!

40:53.515 --> 40:57.076
Drop the gun, Santa!
Put your hands up!

41:02.276 --> 41:04.356
Adrian!

41:07.655 --> 41:09.546
By the way,

41:09.581 --> 41:12.801
in case we don't get
a chance to talk later,

41:12.836 --> 41:14.263
I just want you to know...

41:14.298 --> 41:17.658
except for the murders...
and your trying to kill me...

41:17.693 --> 41:21.364
you really were
the best doctor I ever had.

41:21.399 --> 41:23.694
Hang on, Manny.
They're coming to get you.

41:23.729 --> 41:26.396
And merry Christmas.

41:42.499 --> 41:43.602
Hello?

41:43.637 --> 41:44.940
Sharona.

41:44.975 --> 41:46.638
Don't laugh, okay?

41:46.673 --> 41:48.820
I just need to be sure.

41:48.855 --> 41:50.994
Is there a skinny
oak tree by the window?

41:51.029 --> 41:52.466
Yes.

41:52.501 --> 41:55.430
Is there an armoire
by the closet?

41:55.857 --> 41:58.875
And is Trudy's picture
on the nightstand?

42:00.221 --> 42:01.296
Yep.

42:01.331 --> 42:02.885
Adrian.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.928
You're in your own house.
Now go to sleep.

42:05.963 --> 42:07.047
Thanks.

42:07.082 --> 42:08.506
Good news.

42:08.541 --> 42:12.176
I'm seriously considering
you for Employee of the Month.

42:12.796 --> 42:16.170
Thanks, boss.
I'll see you tomorrow.
