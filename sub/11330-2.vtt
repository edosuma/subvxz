00:00.208 --> 00:03.163
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.195 --> 00:04.716
I love sleeping over here.

00:04.776 --> 00:06.236
I want you and John to live here.

00:06.259 --> 00:07.714
It's not going to bring her back,

00:07.715 --> 00:09.243
hiding here in the condo.

00:09.278 --> 00:10.953
I can find another place to stay.

00:10.954 --> 00:12.311
Grace isn't even in the house.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.434
I never thought she'd
actually go to Zimbabwe.

00:14.436 --> 00:16.567
Adrian and Ben are
not going to split up.

00:16.699 --> 00:18.054
If anything,
they're closer than ever,

00:18.055 --> 00:19.318
having been through
what they've been through.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.458
Well, what about Ricky?

00:20.493 --> 00:23.015
Is he letting you move in to keep 
himself from Adrian?

00:23.016 --> 00:24.828
Is there any way you could drop by
our condo today

00:24.829 --> 00:26.520
and see if Adrian will let you in to talk
to her?

00:26.521 --> 00:28.361
She has to talk to someone
other than me.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.657
I want to talk
to you about something.

00:29.658 --> 00:31.283
Why would you be
looking for another job?

00:31.292 --> 00:33.900
It's time to make I just think
a change in my life.

00:34.011 --> 00:35.773
I know it must be
really tough, Adrian.

00:36.374 --> 00:38.375
Yeah, it is.

00:38.409 --> 00:39.973
Do you still have
feelings for Adrian?

00:39.974 --> 00:41.982
Feeling sorry for her
is dangerous.

00:42.011 --> 00:43.183
I'm here with Rachel.

00:43.184 --> 00:45.601
We were just discussing her
moving into the guest house.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.867
Being married and having a baby
in high school is scary.

00:47.888 --> 00:51.112
Not as scary as holding your stillborn
daughter in your arms.

00:51.175 --> 00:53.083
Don't say it out loud.

00:53.127 --> 00:54.289
I don't want to be married.

00:54.531 --> 00:55.495
Me neither.

00:55.599 --> 00:57.448
But we can't do
anything about it.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:21.881 --> 01:23.024
Leo.

01:24.329 --> 01:26.263
I know you still miss her.

01:26.297 --> 01:27.631
It's just, uh...

01:28.238 --> 01:29.726
It's okay.

01:30.909 --> 01:35.180
And losing that baby must be so difficult
for you and Ben.

01:35.246 --> 01:37.664
It's got to be so painful.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.860
I just feel so terrible
for you both.

01:41.050 --> 01:44.416
But I gotta say, I feel even worse
for Adrian.

01:44.462 --> 01:47.757
It's just that I think about

01:48.255 --> 01:52.275
Sarah when I see Ben like he is.

01:53.471 --> 01:55.395
He's in a really bad place.

01:55.662 --> 01:59.365
Which is not to say I don't feel terrible
for Adrian, too,

02:00.266 --> 02:03.833
who I guess is in a worse place.
I don't know.

02:03.834 --> 02:07.204
Maybe I could go over there again tomorrow

02:07.239 --> 02:09.783
and see if there was something
I could do for her,

02:09.917 --> 02:12.185
to bring her mood up.

02:14.414 --> 02:17.895
All right, well,
you better get to bed.

02:18.068 --> 02:20.379
I'll, uh...
I'll be up in a minute.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.800
Don't you want to come
upstairs with me now?

02:24.005 --> 02:26.047
I bet you I could get
your mood up.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.878
I'm sure, but I've got
a lot on my mind.

02:29.907 --> 02:33.134
Camille quit today and I gotta go over
my schedule

02:33.135 --> 02:35.337
for tomorrow
and the rest of the week.

02:36.001 --> 02:37.695
I gotta take care
of some business.

02:37.710 --> 02:40.156
What?
Camille quit?

02:40.157 --> 02:42.910
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, when did that happen?

02:44.862 --> 02:47.451
I got home and Ben was here,

02:47.485 --> 02:49.755
and I didn't get
a chance to tell you.

02:49.872 --> 02:52.351
Tomorrow, I'll get
an assistant from marketing

02:52.352 --> 02:55.523
or I'll get a temp or something until
I can find someone.

02:55.524 --> 02:57.992
Oh, no, you won't!

02:58.331 --> 03:00.934
No, cause I'm going
to get up bright and early.

03:00.959 --> 03:03.048
And I'm going to go in with you.

03:03.370 --> 03:07.206
I can do anything that Camille can do,
if not more.

03:07.241 --> 03:11.243
You won't believe how smart I am.
What time do we leave?

03:11.278 --> 03:13.933
I mean, I've always wanted
to do something like this,

03:13.974 --> 03:17.831
be an assistant to a big, important
man like yourself.

03:19.218 --> 03:21.033
What time did you say?

03:22.913 --> 03:25.253
That's really nice
of you to offer,

03:25.738 --> 03:28.152
great at the job, Betty,
and I'm sure you'd be

03:28.175 --> 03:32.049
hey, how great Would it be that I
get and to work with my wife, huh?

03:33.754 --> 03:37.000
But the most important thing
you could do for me tomorrow,

03:37.358 --> 03:39.270
is to take care of Ben.

03:39.571 --> 03:43.375
And if you want to go by the condo
and visit with Adrian,

03:43.409 --> 03:45.443
I know he'll appreciate it.

03:46.312 --> 03:47.794
And so would I.

03:49.039 --> 03:53.288
Okay, well,
if that's what you want,

03:53.539 --> 03:55.351
consider it done.

03:56.954 --> 03:58.426
Good night.

04:25.217 --> 04:27.280
Where do you think she is?

04:29.422 --> 04:31.443
It's a little cold out here,
don't you think?

04:31.454 --> 04:32.735
I'm okay.

04:38.331 --> 04:40.363
I don't know where
she is, Adrian.

04:41.836 --> 04:43.555
I don't think there's
any way of knowing.

04:43.556 --> 04:46.278
Do you think she
exists in some way,

04:47.246 --> 04:49.274
or something? In some other dimension

04:49.308 --> 04:51.410
I like to think so, yeah.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.515
I like to think that the people we've known
are all somewhere

04:57.194 --> 05:02.032
that's nice and safe
and, uh, warm.

05:02.919 --> 05:06.610
And that maybe they're
looking down on us,

05:07.194 --> 05:10.500
we don't know about, in some
way that taking care of us

05:11.198 --> 05:12.365
can't know about.

05:12.399 --> 05:15.017
She's just a baby,

05:15.972 --> 05:20.254
Who's taking care of her?
An innocent, little baby.

05:21.308 --> 05:24.311
I can't stand to think
that she has no one,

05:24.579 --> 05:27.635
That she's alone
or crying or something.

05:27.757 --> 05:28.889
Yeah.

05:30.350 --> 05:31.484
I know, Adrian.

05:33.189 --> 05:35.053
I have those horrible thoughts
sometimes, too,

05:35.054 --> 05:39.156
taking care of her.
That my mom is but I like to think

05:39.168 --> 05:42.441
you're my wife And you know what,

05:42.579 --> 05:44.333
And I have to take
care of you, too.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.421
What do you say? Let's go inside.

05:56.544 --> 05:58.220
I love you, Ben.

05:58.546 --> 06:00.435
I love you too, Adrian.

06:00.515 --> 06:03.044
Amy moved in
with Ricky, you know.

06:06.055 --> 06:07.024
I didn't know.

06:07.078 --> 06:08.550
Yeah, she told me, today.

06:08.705 --> 06:10.248
Is that what upset you?

06:10.324 --> 06:11.491
No, Ben.

06:12.701 --> 06:15.786
Losing the baby,
that's what upset me.

06:50.469 --> 06:53.457
Hi. What are you doing?

06:53.690 --> 06:55.232
Eh, I needed a project,

06:55.233 --> 06:56.225
thought I'd do some updating.

06:56.614 --> 06:59.717
You're gonna update my house?
This is my house.

06:59.751 --> 07:00.553
Is it?

07:00.576 --> 07:02.030
Yeah, you got the business,

07:02.031 --> 07:03.720
I got the house. You gave me the house.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.583
I own the house, you're just living here.

07:05.628 --> 07:07.690
Yeah, well, while I'm living here, alone,

07:07.725 --> 07:08.891
I thought I'd make the house better,

07:08.926 --> 07:09.985
just like I made the business better.

07:09.986 --> 07:11.417
The store has never done this well.

07:11.596 --> 07:14.763
Yeah, I know.
I'm giving you a lot of business.

07:14.797 --> 07:18.500
Or Donovan, anyway.
He has this upholsterer who's a genius...

07:20.836 --> 07:22.490
Yeah, you can thank me later.

07:22.806 --> 07:24.432
And you know, you can't update

07:24.433 --> 07:26.257
in here without showing
me what you're doing.

07:26.450 --> 07:27.950
I'll show you
when I figure it out.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.334
You haven't figured it out, yet?

07:30.590 --> 07:32.966
It looks like you might be doing
some demolition.

07:33.103 --> 07:34.113
I might be.

07:34.276 --> 07:37.136
No, George, no demolition.
Not without a plan.

07:37.137 --> 07:39.259
A plan that I've seen and approved.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.730
And even then, not while
you're watching Robie.

07:41.877 --> 07:43.796
You said that I could bring Robie by.
Did you forget?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.589
Did you forget? No, I didn't forget.

07:45.601 --> 07:47.819
I thought it could be a father and son thing.
Come here, my man.

07:47.824 --> 07:49.990
Yay!

07:50.479 --> 07:53.218
Well, it'll have to be
a father, son and mother thing

07:53.219 --> 07:55.206
because I have to know
what you two are doing.

07:55.246 --> 07:57.110
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be back by three.

07:57.111 --> 07:58.320
I wanna miss all the traffic.

07:58.321 --> 08:00.847
I don't want to turn a
two-hour drive into a four.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.410
Hey, are you okay? You seem a little off.

08:07.441 --> 08:08.542
I'm fine.

08:08.762 --> 08:11.798
Well, you don't seem fine.
Are you angry at someone?

08:12.066 --> 08:12.875
At me?

08:12.892 --> 08:15.534
I'm annoyed with Amy.
She moved in with Ricky.

08:15.753 --> 08:17.548
Well, I think we knew that
that was gonna happen.

08:17.605 --> 08:19.286
No, we didn't. We knew it might happen,

08:19.287 --> 08:20.940
we hoped it wouldn't happen, didn't we?

08:21.212 --> 08:22.664
Well, I guess we're just
going to have to see

08:22.665 --> 08:24.819
if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
I don't know.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.196
Did she tell you she was moving in?

08:26.222 --> 08:27.630
No. But she told me that she was spending

08:27.631 --> 08:29.098
practically every night there.

08:30.127 --> 08:31.569
You know, they were already having sex,

08:31.570 --> 08:33.010
if that's what was bothering you.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.875
I realize that, but they were not
living together, and now they are.

08:36.017 --> 08:38.517
I found this out when Ruben came
over for a drink last night.

08:38.518 --> 08:38.979
I saw him when I pulled

08:38.980 --> 08:40.434
up in the driveway and
made the mistake of...

08:40.470 --> 08:41.832
Did you just look at your watch?

08:41.832 --> 08:44.081
I have to go, George. I'm sorry.

08:44.312 --> 08:45.841
Look, I don't know what
you're so upset about.

08:45.842 --> 08:48.534
We knew that this was happening,
it was just a matter of time.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.026
A matter of not enough time. Go, just go.

08:52.862 --> 08:54.729
Hey, did you hear from Ashley last night?

08:54.763 --> 08:55.766
No, did you?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.297
I got a text from her.
And that was not our agreement.

08:58.298 --> 08:59.419
Yeah, I know that.

08:59.485 --> 09:02.936
Okay, bye, Robie. I'll see you boys later.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.949
Don't do anything without a plan,

09:04.950 --> 09:06.837
a plan that I've seen and approved.

09:07.846 --> 09:08.699
Bye.

09:12.246 --> 09:14.452
Don't listen to her. You listen to me.

09:14.483 --> 09:16.952
I'm a grown man and I say, "We
can do whatever we want."

09:17.024 --> 09:18.399
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.497
So what do you wanna bust up first?

09:21.938 --> 09:22.549
Oh.

09:27.949 --> 09:29.551
Hey, I'm reporting in.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.435
You were supposed to report in last night.

09:31.451 --> 09:34.378
But we drove 12 hours yesterday
and it was late when we stopped.

09:34.445 --> 09:35.732
What are the rules, Ashley?

09:35.785 --> 09:37.370
I have to call you every night.

09:37.559 --> 09:39.236
Day one and you broke the rules.

09:39.259 --> 09:41.703
I told you it was late.
I didn't want to wake you up.

09:41.704 --> 09:42.412
There's nothing in the rules

09:42.413 --> 09:43.869
that says if it's too late, you don't call.

09:43.870 --> 09:45.317
You call every night, all right?

09:45.319 --> 09:47.167
No matter how early or
late it is, you got that?

09:47.304 --> 09:48.955
- I got that.
- What are the other rules?

09:48.969 --> 09:50.333
Are you breaking any of the other rules?

09:54.556 --> 09:56.787
The rules are we have to
stay in the same room,

09:56.788 --> 09:58.592
separate beds, no sex.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.914
No drugs. No alcohol.
No driving after 9:00.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.784
Don't let the gas tank
get below a half a tank.

10:04.818 --> 10:07.106
No speeding. No tornado chasing.

10:07.144 --> 10:09.856
No hanging my arms or feet out the windows.

10:10.229 --> 10:13.476
Uh, Toby is not allowed to
pee on the side of the road.

10:13.477 --> 10:16.898
And I'm not allowed to go to
the restroom at truck stops.

10:16.933 --> 10:17.824
Should I keep going?

10:17.922 --> 10:22.424
No. So, how far did you get?
What city you in?

10:23.955 --> 10:26.050
I don't know. I think it's called Kingman.

10:26.111 --> 10:28.567
Kingman? Kingman is like
a couple of hours away.

10:28.742 --> 10:30.321
Well, we didn't go on the freeway.

10:30.343 --> 10:31.443
Still. You can't be in Kingman.

10:31.477 --> 10:33.030
It doesn't take a whole
day to get to Kingman.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.744
Oh, we stopped at this
town and fed donkeys.

10:35.779 --> 10:36.869
Yeah, and?

10:36.914 --> 10:38.044
It was educational.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.858
You fed donkeys all day,
and that was educational?

10:39.884 --> 10:42.023
Yeah. How is that educational, Ashley?

10:42.029 --> 10:43.500
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard

10:43.501 --> 10:45.503
stayed in the hotel there
on their honeymoon.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.795
Are you talking about Oatman?

10:47.005 --> 10:48.285
Oatman is where Olive Oatman was

10:48.286 --> 10:50.882
given back to the US Army
by the Mojave Indians.

10:50.892 --> 10:51.967
Oh, I didn't know.

10:52.043 --> 10:53.925
She was taken by the
Yavapai and held captive,

10:53.926 --> 10:55.319
and then traded to the Mojave.

10:55.347 --> 10:56.492
I had no idea.

10:56.644 --> 10:57.799
Well, now you do.

10:57.926 --> 10:59.128
Well, we're not going back there,

10:59.129 --> 11:00.438
so what difference does it make?

11:00.518 --> 11:02.296
You're supposed to be learning something.

11:02.301 --> 11:03.989
I did. I learned where Clark Gable and

11:03.990 --> 11:05.920
Carol Lombard went on their honeymoon.

11:06.945 --> 11:08.974
And I have to go now. Sorry.

11:09.087 --> 11:12.865
Okay, well, call me tonight, and
tell Toby to drive safely today,

11:12.909 --> 11:15.619
and you two pay more attention to
where you are and what you're seeing.

11:15.664 --> 11:17.462
All right. Bye, Dad.

11:17.463 --> 11:19.475
- I love you, Ashley.
- Love you, too.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.077
Your dad wasn't too happy, was he?

11:23.227 --> 11:27.228
Apparently Donkey Town had some
historical significance that we missed.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.070
Come on. Let's get on the freeway.

11:30.132 --> 11:32.602
Freeway? I thought we
were taking old Route 66.

11:32.603 --> 11:35.199
That's what I mapped out, old Route 66.

11:35.257 --> 11:38.012
That's not the freeway.
I don't even know where the freeway is.

11:38.116 --> 11:41.556
It's the red line that goes from
the West Coast to the East Coast.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.051
Yeah, I don't know how
to get to the red line.

11:45.085 --> 11:48.087
That's the 10.
We're nowhere near the 10 freeway.

11:48.122 --> 11:50.885
We'll just figure it out.
My dad thinks we're moving too slow.

11:51.048 --> 11:52.062
So do I.

11:52.085 --> 11:54.690
Oh, another day of cheap sexual innuendo?

11:54.713 --> 11:56.547
Sorry, couldn't help myself.

11:57.912 --> 11:58.916
We're going to miss a lot of good stuff

11:58.951 --> 12:00.062
if we get on the freeway, you know.

12:00.361 --> 12:02.588
All right.
Well, you're driving, you decide.

12:11.166 --> 12:11.986
Dad?

12:13.661 --> 12:14.314
Hey.

12:15.104 --> 12:17.464
Hey, you needed something?

12:17.577 --> 12:19.125
Yeah, I needed something.

12:19.215 --> 12:20.361
What do you need? I have school.

12:20.519 --> 12:21.621
Where were you last night?

12:22.178 --> 12:24.513
I came home and no one was here.

12:24.765 --> 12:27.627
Oh, I was over at uh, you
know, the apartment.

12:27.643 --> 12:29.861
So, it's gone from Ricky's
apartment to the apartment?

12:29.888 --> 12:31.367
No, no, it's still Ricky's apartment.

12:31.368 --> 12:34.135
I was just using a more neutral
term, I guess, "The apartment."

12:34.151 --> 12:35.272
More neutral than what?

12:35.535 --> 12:37.214
Well, Ricky calls it "Our apartment,"

12:37.215 --> 12:38.089
Not that it's our apartment,

12:38.090 --> 12:39.706
'cause it's really "His apartment."

12:39.710 --> 12:41.721
But you're living there, at his apartment?

12:41.775 --> 12:42.981
I don't know if I would say living there.

12:42.982 --> 12:44.338
Who said I was living there? Ashley?

12:44.381 --> 12:45.476
I heard from the neighbors.

12:45.525 --> 12:46.793
Sure you did. What neighbors?

12:46.828 --> 12:48.629
Ruben. Who heard it from his wife.

12:48.663 --> 12:49.763
Who heard it from their daughter.

12:50.699 --> 12:52.500
- Oh.
- Yeah, "Oh."

12:54.470 --> 12:57.739
Well, I have been staying over there.
But you knew that.

12:57.774 --> 12:59.223
But now you're not just staying over there,

12:59.224 --> 13:00.311
you're living over there.

13:00.911 --> 13:02.515
Well, "Staying" Sounds so, like,

13:02.518 --> 13:04.883
low class, so, yeah, I
prefer to say "Living."

13:04.898 --> 13:05.888
No matter what you call it,

13:05.889 --> 13:08.193
living together unmarried,
that is low class.

13:08.777 --> 13:11.275
You're the one who said it and
you're right, it's low class.

13:11.426 --> 13:13.719
Weren't you and Mom just living
together and not married

13:13.720 --> 13:14.899
just a short time ago?

13:15.134 --> 13:16.807
We were. And you see how that worked out?

13:16.825 --> 13:18.066
Yeah, I'm sorry that it didn't work out.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.221
I had hoped that it would.

13:19.910 --> 13:21.787
Do you hope things will
work out with Ricky and me?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.482
I've told you more than
once that it won't work out

13:23.483 --> 13:25.486
if you just move in there
without any kind of commitment.

13:25.493 --> 13:27.153
But I guess I lost that
argument long time ago

13:27.154 --> 13:28.485
when you started staying over there.

13:28.498 --> 13:31.818
So I guess I don't understand
why you're so upset then.

13:31.905 --> 13:33.750
I'm upset because of the
way I heard about this.

13:33.783 --> 13:35.209
If you and Ricky make
any more bad decisions,

13:35.210 --> 13:36.409
I'd like to know first.

13:36.497 --> 13:39.188
I don't like getting bad news from
the neighbors, especially Ruben.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.125
I can't believe he'd be so
concerned with my personal life.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.020
Why would he tell you that
I'm living over there?

13:44.026 --> 13:45.468
Why not? You are, aren't you?

13:45.508 --> 13:47.481
And he just assumed I knew, you
know, since I'm your father,

13:47.482 --> 13:49.053
and you were living here
before you were living there.

13:49.069 --> 13:50.604
Do we have to make such
a big deal out of this?

13:50.605 --> 13:51.918
It's really not that big of a deal.

13:51.996 --> 13:54.018
Do we have to make a big deal
out of you and my grandson

13:54.019 --> 13:55.796
living with your boyfriend?
Are you kidding?

13:55.841 --> 13:58.927
No? And Ricky's not just my
boyfriend, he's John's father.

13:59.023 --> 14:01.541
I thought maybe if the two of you
like being with each other so much,

14:01.551 --> 14:02.797
that maybe you'd get engaged.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.205
And you'd stay engaged through college,

14:04.239 --> 14:06.280
and then after you graduate
college, then you'd get married,

14:06.281 --> 14:07.872
and then you'd actually
move in with each other.

14:07.893 --> 14:09.340
- Really? 
- Really.

14:09.447 --> 14:10.381
You're just not old enough or

14:10.382 --> 14:12.569
mature enough to be living
together on your own.

14:12.576 --> 14:13.890
We're not old enough or mature enough

14:13.891 --> 14:15.117
to have a two-year-old son either.

14:15.163 --> 14:16.633
No, you're not, but just
because you have John

14:16.634 --> 14:17.865
doesn't mean you have
to raise him together,

14:17.871 --> 14:19.323
unmarried, in the same apartment.

14:19.357 --> 14:21.358
I know that but that's what we want to do.

14:21.392 --> 14:23.171
Dad, Ricky's going to be
in college next year,

14:23.172 --> 14:24.528
and I'm going to be a senior.

14:24.912 --> 14:25.490
So?

14:25.537 --> 14:28.463
So? So we're young, but we're very mature.

14:28.557 --> 14:29.911
Yeah, sure you are.

14:30.015 --> 14:31.980
Okay, fine, I don't know. Maybe, we're not.

14:31.981 --> 14:33.640
But like I told Ashley yesterday,

14:33.675 --> 14:35.954
I'm happy. I'm really happy, okay?

14:35.988 --> 14:38.860
So, please, just let me be happy. Please.

14:43.603 --> 14:45.671
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, Dad.

14:49.376 --> 14:54.169
Well, Amy, the door is always open.
You know that.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.942
When it doesn't work out,

14:55.964 --> 14:58.057
the door is always open.
You can always come home.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.000
If it does work out,

15:01.660 --> 15:03.220
will the door be open?

15:04.870 --> 15:05.920
I love you, Dad.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.430
I love you too, Amy.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.230
In the blink of an eye.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.140
***

15:28.520 --> 15:30.470
How lousy I feel right now has

15:30.680 --> 15:33.270
nothing to do with what's
going on with Ricky and Amy.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.570
I mean, so they're living together?
So what?

15:35.760 --> 15:38.840
That has nothing to do with Ben
and me and what happened to us.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.170
I know, but it must be hard.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.410
I mean, you and Ricky were really close

15:42.570 --> 15:44.260
and Amy knows that and Amy

15:44.450 --> 15:46.170
knows how hard everything is for you now.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.560
I just don't know why it happened.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.740
I can't figure out why it happened, Grace.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.040
Oh, Adrian, I don't think there's a why.

15:55.200 --> 15:55.920
I mean, there's no why.

15:56.090 --> 15:58.620
It just happened, things just happen.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.680
I wish I was there to give you a hug.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.500
I mean, it'll be okay, you just need time.

16:03.710 --> 16:07.030
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

16:07.410 --> 16:09.290
No one seems to understand that.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.540
I mean, everyone's in such a hurry

16:11.700 --> 16:14.280
for me to just go back
to the way things were

16:14.480 --> 16:17.490
and just do the same things I
was doing before this happened.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.280
But going back to the way

16:20.480 --> 16:23.940
things were seems like, I don't know, like,

16:24.920 --> 16:26.760
like I'm not honoring my little girl.

16:27.130 --> 16:28.220
Adrian, that's sad.

16:28.410 --> 16:31.170
But maybe the best way
to honor her is to just

16:31.360 --> 16:33.910
get back out there and live your
life in a way that honors her.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.750
Maybe you could do something

16:35.950 --> 16:37.690
like a good deed in her name or something.

16:38.270 --> 16:40.460
You mean like volunteering
to help in Africa?

16:42.230 --> 16:43.020
I have to go.

16:46.970 --> 16:47.680
How was Grace?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.640
Grace was Grace. Have a good day at school.

16:50.450 --> 16:51.790
What'd she say? Nothing.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.800
She said something that upset you.
I can tell.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.590
You know, your two best friends

16:57.790 --> 16:59.440
don't seem to know how
to be your best friends.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.410
It's not just them, it's everyone.

17:01.690 --> 17:02.610
Including me?

17:04.819 --> 17:07.260
No, Ben, not including you.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.310
Bye.

17:24.829 --> 17:25.490
Dad?

17:25.690 --> 17:26.829
How are you this morning?

17:27.030 --> 17:27.630
Why?

17:27.950 --> 17:28.900
Why?

17:29.180 --> 17:30.260
What's going on?

17:30.470 --> 17:31.290
What do you mean what's going on?

17:31.520 --> 17:32.800
I'm just calling to see how you're doing.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.350
Oh, okay, sorry.
I misread something in your voice.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.700
Okay, there is something going on.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.670
Look, yesterday I didn't get
a chance to tell you this,

17:41.880 --> 17:42.600
and there's really no

17:42.810 --> 17:45.610
reason I would tell you
this, but Camille quit.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.510
Are you kidding? Why would she quit?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.420
I guess after 25 years
of me, she's had enough.

17:50.710 --> 17:51.890
But that's not the problem.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.820
Well, no, that's a huge problem.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.900
She was like your second wife.

17:57.100 --> 18:01.010
No she's not. I can replace her.
She can be replaced.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.390
And you're calling to tell me this?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.560
Not exactly. The thing is,

18:05.760 --> 18:08.050
Betty has offered to come
in and work with me today.

18:09.850 --> 18:10.580
That's funny.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.670
No, that's not funny.
But that can't happen.

18:13.890 --> 18:14.880
It could happen.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.690
It's not going to because she'd

18:16.880 --> 18:18.690
rather come over there and
visit with Adrian today.

18:18.890 --> 18:19.730
Bad idea.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.330
We don't know that.

18:21.530 --> 18:22.600
No, we do know that.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.650
Did you send her over here instead
of going over to your office?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.610
Look, all she just wants to do
is drop by there this afternoon,

18:28.800 --> 18:29.780
and that's better than

18:29.970 --> 18:31.110
her spending all day at the office with me.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.470
I have a business to run.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.910
Well, yeah, I have a wife that's

18:35.120 --> 18:37.020
a little depressed.
My life isn't easy either.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.020
Look, maybe those two could have
a bite to eat, an early dinner.

18:40.210 --> 18:41.350
And then you and I will go out,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.280
have an early dinner too and we'll talk.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.170
I don't know if Adrian
will let Betty come over.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.200
Then let Betty handle it.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.890
Betty's going to call her and
ask her if she can come over.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.260
Ben?

18:52.920 --> 18:54.240
Amy moved in with Ricky.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.050
So?

18:58.790 --> 19:00.430
It was such a stupid thing to say to her,

19:00.620 --> 19:02.200
and I try to be so careful of what I say,

19:02.410 --> 19:03.850
but I just said the wrong thing anyway.

19:04.090 --> 19:06.170
So, could you just go by there
and make sure she's okay?

19:06.380 --> 19:09.270
Grace, I don't think Adrian would
want me to just drop by there.

19:09.610 --> 19:11.810
And I don't think what you
said is totally unreasonable.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.470
In fact, I think it was pretty good advice.

19:13.670 --> 19:16.090
I just, I don't think Adrian wants
to hear any advice, right now.

19:16.310 --> 19:17.730
You can go see her as soon as you get back.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.320
About that. Here's what I'm thinking.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.050
This is a really long way
to come for just two weeks.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.700
That's why I told you
doing something like this

19:24.900 --> 19:26.500
would be better in the
summer when school's out.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.540
Yeah, but the opportunity
presented itself now,

19:28.740 --> 19:30.880
and I'm really glad that I came here.
It's amazing.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.180
I just, I hate to leave so soon.

19:33.370 --> 19:34.540
Yet, you're going to have to

19:34.770 --> 19:36.180
because you have to finish the school year.

19:36.370 --> 19:37.410
The counselor said,"Two weeks,"

19:37.620 --> 19:39.620
And I agree. So it's two weeks, honey.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.110
And besides, Jeff is only

19:41.300 --> 19:42.850
helping out that group for
a couple of more weeks

19:43.060 --> 19:43.890
and then he's moving on to

19:44.100 --> 19:45.480
his new job and you can't just go with him.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.990
But he said I could if I wanted.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.470
Well, why don't you tell him

19:48.660 --> 19:50.320
to call me about that
when he gets a chance.

19:51.030 --> 19:51.910
And...

19:52.120 --> 19:54.720
Don't you miss me?
Honey, don't you miss your family here?

19:54.930 --> 19:55.820
Hey, Grace.

19:56.040 --> 19:56.680
Hi, Jack.

19:56.890 --> 19:57.840
Hey, I'm sorry about the move,

19:58.040 --> 19:59.430
but I talked to Grant
and he's cool with it,

19:59.630 --> 20:00.900
so I don't think it's gonna be a problem.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.370
You hadn't told her? No.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.920
I'll be back. I was just making my lunch,

20:06.100 --> 20:07.290
and I need to grab some mayonnaise.

20:07.650 --> 20:10.710
What move? Where's he moving?
And why's he moving?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.880
Mom, please do not tell me
it's because you're letting

20:13.080 --> 20:14.430
Tom's girlfriend move into the guest house.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.430
Mom, you can't be serious about that.

20:17.690 --> 20:18.960
Grace, when she explained

20:19.140 --> 20:21.190
her situation to me, I
just couldn't say no.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.160
And, honey, Tom is so happy. He really is.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.570
So I told Jack he could move into

20:26.780 --> 20:29.100
the house and take Tom's old
room until school's out.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.000
Don't do that face.
That's not attractive, Grace.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.140
Grace!

20:40.500 --> 20:41.760
Who told your dad you moved in?

20:42.280 --> 20:43.100
Who do you think?

20:43.300 --> 20:44.250
I think Ashley.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.520
Well, we don't know that for sure.

20:45.730 --> 20:47.270
Yeah, we do. He didn't say that.

20:47.470 --> 20:48.520
He wouldn't say that.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.740
I'm going to talk to her
the next time she calls.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.750
Uh, she probably won't call us.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.660
She'll call. Or I'll call her.

20:55.140 --> 20:56.060
You and I will call her.

20:56.260 --> 20:57.230
You want me to talk to your dad?

20:57.460 --> 20:59.030
No, I do not want you to talk to my dad.

20:59.270 --> 21:00.720
Just let it alone. He'll get over it.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.160
I knew when you told me you

21:02.180 --> 21:03.440
told her that she was
going to say something.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.480
That's why I don't want you
saying anything to Adrian.

21:05.670 --> 21:06.810
I know that. I know that

21:07.000 --> 21:08.480
you don't want me to say
anything to Adrian.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.970
Although, you know, uh, my dad
could say something to Ruben,

21:12.170 --> 21:13.120
because, you know, they're friends,

21:13.330 --> 21:14.970
and then Ruben could say something and...

21:16.900 --> 21:20.610
I have to go. I'll see you at home.

21:30.910 --> 21:31.700
***

21:31.940 --> 21:32.730
Yeah. Good morning.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.060
Have you seen Amy? I need to talk to her.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.940
Unless you have some objection.
I'm not too happy with her.

21:39.120 --> 21:39.890
Because?

21:40.210 --> 21:41.350
I'll just take that up with Amy.

21:41.790 --> 21:43.870
Why do you always do that?
Ask if you can speak to Amy,

21:44.040 --> 21:45.400
like she's my property or something.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.650
You want to speak to Amy, speak to Amy.

21:47.830 --> 21:48.920
But right now, you're talking to me.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.220
We're just talking here. What's going on?

21:52.040 --> 21:53.710
I just don't think that Amy
should have said anything

21:53.890 --> 21:55.610
about you two living together to Adrian.

21:55.970 --> 21:57.150
It's a little soon to be rubbing

21:57.350 --> 21:59.760
your cohabiting bliss in
her face, don't you think?

22:00.000 --> 22:03.840
You know Amy stays at the
apartment, so does Adrian.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.280
Yeah, but that's different,

22:05.520 --> 22:07.410
staying over there and living over there.

22:07.610 --> 22:09.010
That seems to be the general opinion.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.170
Either way, it's not
really anyone's business.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.670
Amy made it Adrian's business.
She told her.

22:13.850 --> 22:16.640
Look, I sent her over there
to try to cheer Adrian up.

22:16.820 --> 22:19.410
You know, to bring a little
bit of light to her dark day

22:19.610 --> 22:21.680
and instead she tells her about
you two living together.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.340
Why would Adrian care?

22:23.530 --> 22:24.640
You think at a time like this

22:24.840 --> 22:26.700
Adrian wants to hear about
you and Amy and John

22:26.900 --> 22:28.260
all living happily ever after in

22:28.460 --> 22:30.250
the little apartment above
my family's butcher shop

22:30.430 --> 22:32.240
like it's some sort of freaking fairy tale?

22:32.420 --> 22:33.260
Look, no wonder Adrian

22:33.450 --> 22:35.100
doesn't want anyone to come over and visit.

22:35.280 --> 22:39.220
Everyone's completely insensitive
and just oblivious to the fact

22:39.410 --> 22:40.850
that she's heartbroken
and in a lot of pain.

22:41.050 --> 22:42.030
Let's walk outside, out

22:42.220 --> 22:43.660
of earshot from the
entire school, all right?

22:56.220 --> 22:57.210
I'm going to be straight with you.

22:57.950 --> 22:58.850
I think you're the one who's

22:59.050 --> 23:01.210
upset about Amy moving
in with me, not Adrian,

23:01.400 --> 23:03.530
because I think you want
out of that relationship.

23:04.490 --> 23:05.840
And before you say anything,

23:07.040 --> 23:08.110
I'm going to give you some advice

23:08.300 --> 23:09.400
whether you want it or not.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.200
You've been trying to get

23:11.400 --> 23:14.280
everyone to give Adrian
advice, you take some advice.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.020
From a guy who's been there.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.150
I did not want to be with Amy when
I found out she was pregnant,

23:20.340 --> 23:22.160
I didn't even want to be
with her when she had John.

23:23.380 --> 23:26.900
It took a long time, a very
long time to get to know her,

23:27.640 --> 23:30.170
and for things to change between us.
I wanted to run.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.510
And I know you want to run.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.100
But you can't. You can't right now.
And you know that.

23:38.110 --> 23:41.310
Just wait it out, Ben. Just wait it out.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.550
You might feel differently
in another year or two.

23:45.180 --> 23:47.740
Things might get better
between you and Adrian.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.000
You got married for the wrong reasons,

23:50.180 --> 23:52.400
maybe you'll stay together
for the right reasons.

23:54.030 --> 23:55.580
But even if things don't get better,

23:55.790 --> 23:57.430
even if you and Adrian split up,

23:57.660 --> 23:59.540
you and Amy, that's over.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.370
Me and Adrian, that's over.

24:04.030 --> 24:05.340
I'm in love with Amy, and

24:05.530 --> 24:07.450
I'm gonna be with her for
the rest of my life.

24:07.730 --> 24:09.000
And only with her.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.330
If I do leave Adrian,

24:13.520 --> 24:15.990
you'll feel even sorrier
for her than you do now.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.480
Way too sorry for her
not to sleep with her.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.000
You've changed, but you
haven't changed that much.

24:26.010 --> 24:28.120
Yeah, we know each other

24:28.310 --> 24:30.700
a little too well at this point, don't we?

24:43.450 --> 24:44.320
Excuse me?

24:44.530 --> 24:45.830
Madison, you felt the same way when

24:46.010 --> 24:47.990
I moved into the guest house,
and nothing happened.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.620
We're not going to get back together.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.950
I'm going to live in Tom's
old room until graduation,

24:52.140 --> 24:53.510
and then I'm going to Arizona to

24:53.710 --> 24:55.230
stay with my parents and then
I'm going off to school.

24:55.430 --> 24:57.480
Where are you going to school?
Have you decided yet?

24:58.130 --> 25:00.210
I want to be near my parents.
I'll probably go to Arizona.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.000
I see. Even if you get a

25:02.190 --> 25:04.130
full scholarship to a
school that's right here.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.680
I miss my parents. I want

25:05.860 --> 25:07.810
to live at home and go to school.
I miss them.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.930
You miss them? Aren't you going to miss me?

25:10.140 --> 25:12.790
You're one year behind me.
You can come to Arizona next year.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.930
It'll be one year of us
driving back and forth

25:15.110 --> 25:16.510
and then we'll be at the same school again.

25:16.790 --> 25:20.160
Oh. Okay. I still don't like your

25:20.370 --> 25:22.020
living in the house in the
bedroom next to Grace.

25:22.210 --> 25:26.820
But if in the end, I win,
I'm okay with that.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.990
I'm an idiot. I completely lied to him.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.380
I can't believe I did that.

25:34.690 --> 25:36.940
It just happened so quickly, and
then I realized it was wrong,

25:37.120 --> 25:38.530
and I couldn't stop myself and...

25:38.710 --> 25:40.660
So go find him right now and

25:40.830 --> 25:42.910
say you didn't want him
to be upset with you,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.160
you panicked, you lied and
you're sorry you told Adrian

25:46.350 --> 25:47.600
and you should have told him.

25:48.990 --> 25:52.280
Why did I do that?
You know, even if I admit to lying,

25:52.470 --> 25:54.200
it's still not going to
change the fact that I lied.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.380
I don't want to mess anything up.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.800
I just moved in there. I love living there.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.020
I love Ricky and John and me as a family.

26:01.210 --> 26:03.240
Then get out there and
do what you got to do.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.420
And do it quickly, don't wait.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.230
Amy, I need to talk to you.

26:12.420 --> 26:13.230
Do it.

26:15.030 --> 26:15.860
I'm going to call Bunny and

26:16.060 --> 26:17.380
tell her I'm going to
be late for work today.

26:17.580 --> 26:19.010
I wanna go over and talk to your dad.

26:19.190 --> 26:21.020
I don't want him to be
upset with me and I think

26:21.210 --> 26:22.520
I should just go over there and face him.

26:22.710 --> 26:23.600
Look, Ricky...

26:24.500 --> 26:25.540
Yeah?

26:29.190 --> 26:30.790
I asked you to just leave it alone

26:30.990 --> 26:32.990
and I want you to just
leave it alone, okay?

26:33.580 --> 26:35.770
He's my dad and I think I know
better than you what to do here.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.310
All right, I gave you a chance to
tell me and you didn't take it.

26:41.790 --> 26:45.290
I know you're lying.
Ben told me you told Adrian you moved in.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.870
You said you weren't going to do that.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.700
And I said if you did do
that, it would be a problem.

26:51.850 --> 26:52.870
Now it's a problem.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.230
Hey Amy. Hey there, John.

27:13.130 --> 27:16.640
Come here. How was your day, buddy?

27:18.210 --> 27:20.050
Hmm. My day wasn't that great either.

27:20.710 --> 27:24.050
I asked your mom not to do
something and she did it anyway.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.380
Then she lied about it.

27:25.570 --> 27:26.800
Don't tell him bad stuff about me.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.370
I don't tell him bad stuff about you.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.130
No? No, I don't.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.400
Sorry, that was my way of
trying to get an apology.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.890
You baited me, Ricky.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.140
You knew I lied and then you
set me up to lie again.

27:37.340 --> 27:38.320
Oh, so it's my fault?

27:38.560 --> 27:40.320
No. No, it's my fault.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.810
And if you don't want to live
with a liar, then I'll go home.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.740
I'm sure my dad would
be very happy for John

27:45.940 --> 27:46.940
and me to be home again.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.260
This is your home.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.650
Oh. I wasn't sure.

27:51.430 --> 27:52.630
Come on, you're sure.

27:52.980 --> 27:56.010
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know why I told her.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.100
I just told her.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.770
Okay. I'm sorry, too.

28:00.250 --> 28:03.730
About baiting you. Let's go home.

28:04.580 --> 28:05.860
Just like that?

28:06.120 --> 28:07.160
Yeah, let's go home.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.270
You're not even upset with me?

28:09.830 --> 28:11.020
It's over, okay?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.340
It's not going to work.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.100
I don't care how happy they are right now,

28:23.280 --> 28:24.000
it's not going to work.

28:24.190 --> 28:25.840
He got what he wanted,
he's having sex with her

28:26.020 --> 28:27.600
and he didn't even have
to marry her to get it.

28:27.950 --> 28:29.650
You think they should have
gotten married first?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.950
Yeah, Alice, I do. You know why? Why?

28:32.130 --> 28:34.170
Because all he wants to
do is have sex with her.

28:34.370 --> 28:35.440
He doesn't want to marry her.

28:35.620 --> 28:38.090
He's not going to marry her.
He's not going to marry anyone.

28:38.290 --> 28:39.410
He can't make a commitment

28:39.580 --> 28:41.350
to just be with Amy for
the rest of his life.

28:41.540 --> 28:42.690
That's ridiculous!

28:42.880 --> 28:44.620
I mean, I'm sure Amy thinks,

28:44.830 --> 28:45.900
oh, it'll just going to

28:46.070 --> 28:47.770
be the two of them from now until eternity.

28:50.390 --> 28:53.230
Isn't this great?
You know, just hanging out in my room.

28:53.450 --> 28:54.800
It's like old times, isn't it?

28:55.170 --> 28:56.810
Yeah, just like old times.

28:56.990 --> 28:57.970
Old times.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.880
Um, Ben, you know, Alice
and I were wondering,

29:03.590 --> 29:05.190
is it too soon to ask if...

29:05.370 --> 29:06.670
If Adrian and I are going to stay together?

29:06.860 --> 29:09.260
You know, yesterday, I wouldn't
have had an answer for you,

29:09.450 --> 29:10.410
but today, I do.

29:10.690 --> 29:13.030
Look, I got married because
I had to get married.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.930
And no, I do not want to be married.

29:15.110 --> 29:17.500
I just can't get out of it.
Not right now, anyway.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.750
You know, I want to, but it
wouldn't be right, right now.

29:20.930 --> 29:22.710
Adrian is in a very bad place,

29:22.910 --> 29:24.580
and I'm not in a much better place,

29:24.770 --> 29:27.270
but as soon as anything changes,
I'm running for the door.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.150
I just admitted that to my dad last night

29:30.340 --> 29:31.780
and now that the floodgates are open,

29:31.890 --> 29:33.610
I feel like I'm having a hard
time shutting them again.

29:34.090 --> 29:35.560
Boy, does that feel good.

29:35.750 --> 29:40.020
I mean, I know it's just a
horrible, horrible thing to admit,

29:40.200 --> 29:42.790
and I feel guilty admitting it, but boy,

29:43.590 --> 29:46.520
I mean, phew, just a relief
to say it out loud again.

29:47.320 --> 29:49.220
We weren't going to ask if you
two are staying together.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.630
We just wanted to know if it

29:50.820 --> 29:52.650
was too soon to ask if
we could visit Adrian.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.700
Oh. Uh, no, I don't think
she's ready quite yet.

29:59.295 --> 30:00.893
You know, Ben, I don't
think I'd say anything

30:00.894 --> 30:02.818
about this stuff to anyone else.

30:02.819 --> 30:04.037
Things could change.

30:04.038 --> 30:06.002
Not fast enough. I want out.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.993
And every time I say it, I
feel less guilty about it.

30:12.427 --> 30:14.267
I hate to see you like this.

30:14.268 --> 30:15.255
Like what?

30:16.596 --> 30:18.675
Well, you're not Jewish, are you?

30:19.787 --> 30:22.291
You haven't covered up all
your mirrors, have you?

30:22.292 --> 30:24.426
No. I haven't covered the mirrors.

30:24.464 --> 30:25.259
Well, good, 'cause Adrian,

30:25.260 --> 30:30.027
I just don't want you to settle
for looking like a tomato.

30:30.650 --> 30:34.862
When you used to be such a hot tomato.

30:34.863 --> 30:37.313
Is it tamale?

30:37.748 --> 30:39.162
Is it hot tamale?

30:39.564 --> 30:43.938
I don't think it could be tamale
because tamales are thin.

30:44.207 --> 30:46.409
I just think you should go to the gym.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.720
I think you should just
go out and go for a walk

30:49.721 --> 30:53.081
and get some of those new shoes
that can make your butt tight.

30:53.082 --> 30:54.771
There's a great salon in the neighborhood.

30:54.772 --> 30:56.340
You could walk down there

30:56.546 --> 30:58.631
and have them do something with your hair.

30:58.681 --> 31:01.568
Or go out and buy some clothes that fit.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.092
If you want I can take you
out on a big girl day?

31:04.359 --> 31:06.937
We could give you just a big makeover.

31:08.412 --> 31:09.408
Um, Betty,

31:10.783 --> 31:12.040
I'm in mourning.

31:13.143 --> 31:16.294
And Ben doesn't care what I look like.

31:16.722 --> 31:21.273
Take it from a former pro,
honey, he does care.

31:21.911 --> 31:23.204
And so do you.

31:24.612 --> 31:28.404
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but you got to do something.

31:29.106 --> 31:31.637
I mean, you can mourn and still look good.

31:32.367 --> 31:34.136
Just think Jackie Kennedy.

31:37.356 --> 31:38.354
What?

31:38.355 --> 31:41.367
Yeah. She was married to President Kennedy.

31:41.368 --> 31:43.592
Yeah, I know who she is, Betty.

31:43.612 --> 31:45.646
Do you? Well, good,

31:45.647 --> 31:49.266
'cause you're a big mess.
You're a big hot mess.

31:49.688 --> 31:50.666
What are you saying, I'm fat?

31:50.667 --> 31:52.170
Yeah, that too.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.740
But go back to the times
when you were smiling.

31:54.741 --> 31:56.862
You have such a beautiful smile.

31:56.972 --> 32:00.664
I don't want to smile.
I don't feel like smiling.

32:00.665 --> 32:02.510
Well, do it anyway. What?

32:02.511 --> 32:03.864
You're going to be okay, Adrian.

32:03.865 --> 32:05.230
No, I'm not.

32:05.231 --> 32:06.476
Yes, you are.

32:07.784 --> 32:08.892
Smile.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.117
Oh, you got something in your teeth.

32:17.859 --> 32:19.178
See, you got it.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.206
You're the first person

32:23.207 --> 32:25.910
who hasn't treated me
like I'm going to break.

32:25.911 --> 32:29.632
Honey, you're already broken.

32:31.112 --> 32:32.701
What you went through,

32:34.108 --> 32:36.904
I mean it shatters people,

32:36.983 --> 32:41.007
and you just have to put all the
pieces back together again.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.098
I don't think I can, Betty.

32:46.683 --> 32:48.059
I don't think I can.

32:48.122 --> 32:49.841
You can and you will.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.441
You have to.

32:54.246 --> 32:57.897
And you have to take a bath.

33:02.786 --> 33:04.270
I stink, don't I?

33:04.589 --> 33:05.737
Yeah.

33:09.390 --> 33:12.484
I'm afraid he's going to leave me. Ben.

33:13.639 --> 33:15.910
I keep telling everyone he won't, but...

33:16.982 --> 33:18.449
But I'm afraid he will,

33:19.879 --> 33:21.068
and I wouldn't blame him.

33:21.069 --> 33:22.674
I would.

33:22.761 --> 33:25.528
That would be a horrible thing if
he just went out and did that.

33:26.403 --> 33:30.172
I mean, when you're
married, you're married.

33:31.954 --> 33:36.327
And he was in it for better
and now he's in it for worse.

33:37.579 --> 33:40.859
Look, Adrian, if you really
want to stay with Ben,

33:41.306 --> 33:44.376
there's a way you can get
Ben to stay with you.

33:45.804 --> 33:46.603
Thanks, Betty.

33:46.604 --> 33:47.994
Oh, yeah, my pleasure.

33:49.685 --> 33:52.008
Us Boykewich girls gotta stick together.

34:02.448 --> 34:05.787
Well, looks like everyone is getting
settled in,

34:05.788 --> 34:07.875
but I was going to have you over
to eat with us, Rachel.

34:07.876 --> 34:09.462
Oh, that's nice of you, Kathleen,

34:09.463 --> 34:10.206
but I promise,

34:10.208 --> 34:12.650
We're not going to cause
you to do any extra work.

34:12.650 --> 34:13.842
Definitely don't want that.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.299
Say hi to Grandma.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.125
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandma.

34:17.534 --> 34:20.685
You're our first grandma.
Our other one died of being old.

34:21.324 --> 34:22.938
No chance of that with this one.

34:22.940 --> 34:26.833
Uh, Tom, maybe Ronnie and Bonnie should
just call your mom Kathleen.

34:27.072 --> 34:28.321
No, come on.

34:28.638 --> 34:32.755
You always wanted to be
a grandma, didn't you?

34:32.755 --> 34:33.820
Well...

34:35.800 --> 34:36.835
I do love children.

34:36.835 --> 34:39.612
Or Mrs. Tsegaye? Is it Kathleen?

34:39.614 --> 34:41.110
Kathleen. Thank you.

34:41.110 --> 34:44.237
So we're calling
Tom's mother Kathleen.

34:44.237 --> 34:46.987
Or just Kathleen?
So, is it Grandma Kathleen?

34:46.987 --> 34:48.054
Just Kathleen.

34:48.054 --> 34:49.072
Okay.

34:49.072 --> 34:50.112
Good night.

34:59.007 --> 35:01.877
Well, it's just the two of us,
so we can just eat in here.

35:01.878 --> 35:03.081
Everything okay?

35:03.178 --> 35:04.937
Yeah. Everything's fine.

35:05.113 --> 35:06.157
Tom is so happy, isn't he?

35:06.158 --> 35:08.246
He is. For now. Yes, he is.

35:08.247 --> 35:10.014
And thank you for
letting me stay here.

35:10.015 --> 35:11.593
I'm sure things will
be fine with Grace

35:11.594 --> 35:13.471
and Grant and me and all that.

35:13.472 --> 35:16.646
And if things aren't
so fine, then that's that. Yeah.

35:17.062 --> 35:18.257
That's what?

35:18.296 --> 35:20.036
Well, that's how it goes.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.262
So you'd be okay
if they broke up?

35:23.103 --> 35:25.161
Yeah, well, I like Grant,

35:25.162 --> 35:28.228
They're really great.
I do, and I love his parents.

35:28.229 --> 35:30.178
I just, I think all of you guys are

35:30.179 --> 35:32.790
so serious about each other.
A little too young to be

35:32.791 --> 35:34.484
out of high school. I mean, you're not even

35:34.612 --> 35:36.593
do love Madison. Yeah, but I really

35:36.659 --> 35:39.041
so in love with Madison
Are you still going to be

35:39.042 --> 35:40.624
if Grace taps on your door One night

35:40.625 --> 35:42.258
and says she wants to get back together?

35:42.259 --> 35:43.463
Did she say something?

35:43.464 --> 35:44.433
No. She didn't.

35:44.434 --> 35:48.042
Oh. Well, then, no.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.391
"No," What?

35:50.262 --> 35:52.714
I wouldn't want to get
back together with Grace.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.454
Grab the salad.

36:01.973 --> 36:04.332
Hey, give me a minute to change,
and we're on our way.

36:04.333 --> 36:05.380
Take your time.

36:07.195 --> 36:09.364
You know, uh, don't get too
used to that.

36:09.873 --> 36:11.136
You're not coming home, you know that?

36:11.137 --> 36:13.788
I know that. Unless...

36:14.045 --> 36:15.831
Don't go down that road.

36:15.972 --> 36:17.313
No, it's just that...

36:19.767 --> 36:23.987
what if she leaves me? I was thinking,

36:24.717 --> 36:27.564
I've already realized, Adrian
realizes what I mean, what if

36:27.565 --> 36:29.974
for all the wrong reasons
which is that we got married

36:29.975 --> 36:31.762
to go back home? And what if she decides

36:31.763 --> 36:34.323
she's a very smart woman, I mean,

36:34.324 --> 36:36.298
very independent, and she was always

36:36.299 --> 36:38.412
and that could happen.

36:39.362 --> 36:41.926
It could, but I doubt it.

36:44.863 --> 36:47.496
And don't even think about trying
to make it happen.

36:48.112 --> 36:51.714
Is this why you're so bothered with Ricky
and Amy moving in together?

36:51.777 --> 36:54.498
Would leave you for Ricky
You were hoping that Adrian

36:54.499 --> 36:55.997
and now he's not available?

36:56.854 --> 36:58.496
Honestly, I just...

36:58.856 --> 37:01.228
I don't like Amy living with him.

37:01.535 --> 37:02.573
You need to give up the idea

37:02.574 --> 37:05.556
of ever getting back together
with Amy, all right?

37:06.600 --> 37:09.108
There's more than two girls
in the universe, you know.

37:09.117 --> 37:10.246
Yeah, I know.

37:10.943 --> 37:12.031
Do you know?

37:12.032 --> 37:13.021
Do I know what?

37:13.543 --> 37:16.515
That there are more women out there
in the universe for you, too.

37:16.795 --> 37:20.712
I'm married to Betty.
I'm taken. Betty is it.

37:20.895 --> 37:22.894
And what about Camille?

37:23.632 --> 37:24.772
What about Camille?

37:24.773 --> 37:26.462
You're not in love with Camille?

37:26.463 --> 37:29.053
What are you talking about,
you knucklehead?

37:29.077 --> 37:30.667
I'm not in love with Camille.

37:31.285 --> 37:33.608
Well, apparently Camille
is in love with you.

37:33.746 --> 37:34.689
What?

37:34.744 --> 37:37.180
That's why she quit. Dad, of course she is.

37:37.181 --> 37:39.172
She quit because she quit.

37:39.173 --> 37:43.143
No, she quit because Betty came back
and she's giving up.

37:43.383 --> 37:46.931
Ridiculous. You know that?
You're ridiculous,

37:54.610 --> 37:55.621
You think?

38:06.986 --> 38:09.046
You could not have possibly
got him down that quickly.

38:09.047 --> 38:11.294
He doesn't give me
any problems going to bed.

38:12.037 --> 38:15.451
Good, you can put him
to bed every night.

38:15.471 --> 38:17.518
I'm happy to put him
to bed every night.

38:18.015 --> 38:19.016
What bed?

38:19.017 --> 38:20.533
I put the mattress
on the floor for him.

38:20.534 --> 38:23.191
He's getting too old for that.
He doesn't like the baby bed.

38:23.391 --> 38:24.986
But he can just walk
right into the kitchen.

38:24.987 --> 38:27.089
I blocked it all off and No, he can't.

38:27.090 --> 38:28.295
I'll go to sleep on the couch

38:28.296 --> 38:31.224
I'll watch him. To go to sleep.
When we're ready

38:31.843 --> 38:33.567
I can't believe he's two.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.598
Me, neither.

38:36.808 --> 38:39.312
Why are you being so nice to me
after I lied to you?

38:39.329 --> 38:42.145
I'm just happy,
happy you're here.

38:42.351 --> 38:44.148
And I know you're happy
you're here.

38:44.830 --> 38:45.712
That's why you lied to me.

38:45.713 --> 38:49.568
So it's probably not going to be the
worst thing you ever do

38:49.569 --> 38:52.734
or the biggest fight
we'll ever have. But...

38:52.737 --> 38:57.961
Ah, yeah, I knew there
would be a "But."

38:58.331 --> 39:00.303
But I want you to be
honest with me and not

39:00.321 --> 39:02.244
keep anything from me,

39:02.245 --> 39:03.719
and I want to be free to be honest
with you and not keep

39:03.720 --> 39:05.335
anything from you,

39:05.556 --> 39:07.758
even if I do something stupid.

39:08.618 --> 39:09.720
What'd you do?

39:10.208 --> 39:11.221
Nothing.

39:11.222 --> 39:12.285
Nothing yet?

39:12.286 --> 39:14.274
Just nothing. Nothing, Amy.

39:14.275 --> 39:16.640
I haven't done anything
I can't tell you about.

39:16.641 --> 39:17.753
Okay.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.010
Look, it's still early,
John's in bed and I

39:20.011 --> 39:21.814
really would like to go talk to your dad.

39:21.815 --> 39:24.122
I don't want your family
to be upset with us.

39:24.123 --> 39:25.520
That's really nice of you.

39:37.304 --> 39:38.858
Or I could talk to him
another night.

39:38.859 --> 39:40.456
Yeah. Do that.

39:44.183 --> 39:46.358
Oh, I'm sorry,
I really am.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.460
Everything took twice as long
as it should have.

39:48.461 --> 39:51.164
It took me a whole hour to get from
the Design Center to here.

39:51.773 --> 39:54.381
Hate the traffic here.
And I'm starving.

39:55.886 --> 39:57.453
Did you take out the countertop?

39:57.454 --> 39:59.097
Yeah, but don't worry,
I'm going to put in a new one.

39:59.098 --> 40:00.346
And Robie's going to help.

40:03.272 --> 40:04.816
It'll look good, stop worrying.

40:04.817 --> 40:06.022
I'm going to look
at some granite.

40:07.751 --> 40:09.472
I asked you not to do that.

40:09.614 --> 40:10.525
Jeez, It'll be fine. It's going

40:10.526 --> 40:11.238
you'd think you'd thank me. To look better.

40:11.239 --> 40:12.509
You liked that, didn't you?

40:12.510 --> 40:15.453
I did a great job in Ashley's room,
converting the garage.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.619
But I didn't care about the garage.

40:17.762 --> 40:19.825
I didn't want anything
in here to change.

40:19.826 --> 40:21.728
You change things in people's houses
all the time.

40:21.729 --> 40:23.276
Why wouldn't you want
to change things here?

40:23.277 --> 40:24.370
Because.

40:24.413 --> 40:25.521
Because why?

40:26.786 --> 40:29.998
Because I have some really good memories
in this kitchen, that's why.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.184
The same kitchen, It's still going to be

40:31.185 --> 40:32.879
just different countertops.

40:36.931 --> 40:38.729
Thanks for taking care of Robie.

40:38.797 --> 40:40.904
You don't have to thank me,
he's my son too.

40:41.297 --> 40:42.354
Come here.

40:43.445 --> 40:44.650
Goodnight, George.

41:11.787 --> 41:13.003
Forgot to lock the door.

41:13.366 --> 41:14.624
I forgot my purse.

41:17.651 --> 41:20.205
I guess we do have a lot of good memories
in this kitchen.

41:22.345 --> 41:24.580
I can put the countertops
back in, if you want.

41:25.810 --> 41:29.727
No, that's okay.
They were kind of outdated.

41:31.337 --> 41:32.799
Still seeing your boyfriend?

41:33.065 --> 41:34.091
No.

41:35.742 --> 41:37.962
But that doesn't make any difference when
it comes to us.

41:39.389 --> 41:40.947
Has nothing to do with us.
