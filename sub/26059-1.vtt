02:00.964 --> 02:03.834
I love playing
with my new toys.

02:08.771 --> 02:10.806
Did you take your medicine?

02:12.576 --> 02:16.478
What's the matter?
You don't wanna play?

02:25.255 --> 02:28.226
It feels so good.

02:32.729 --> 02:34.230
Yes.

02:34.232 --> 02:37.567
Yes!

03:23.547 --> 03:25.214
You guys finish playing?

03:25.216 --> 03:27.817
Yeah. I'm done for now.

03:27.819 --> 03:30.853
You remember what you
do when you're done playing?

03:30.855 --> 03:33.789
Yes!
I wasn't gonna forget.

03:48.371 --> 03:49.404
Happy?!

03:49.406 --> 03:51.740
It's for your own good.
Not mine.

03:57.982 --> 03:59.815
...so then you just read
those reports on-air?

03:59.817 --> 04:01.717
Yeah, they just
tell me the traffic,

04:01.719 --> 04:03.719
and then I repeat it.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.421
Why don't you just air
what the reporters say?

04:05.423 --> 04:07.456
Ugh, I don't wanna talk
about work anymore.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.292
Let's talk about you.

04:09.294 --> 04:11.427
What do you like to do
outside of work?

04:11.429 --> 04:12.728
You clearly work out.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.130
- Uh...
- What?

04:15.132 --> 04:16.498
I mean, yes...

04:16.500 --> 04:18.100
Oh, come on.
You have a great body.

04:18.101 --> 04:20.769
I'm allowed to appreciate that
in a man.

04:20.771 --> 04:22.607
Plus, you're probably packing,
too.

04:23.641 --> 04:24.740
Mmh.

04:30.115 --> 04:31.981
I'm gonna get another on of these.
Do you want a drink?

04:31.983 --> 04:33.449
- No, I-I...
- Are you sure?

04:33.451 --> 04:35.151
Oh, w-w-waitress!

04:35.153 --> 04:37.887
Can you tell our waiter
to get me another whiskey-Coke?

04:37.889 --> 04:39.555
- Of course.
- Actually, wait, wait.

04:39.557 --> 04:40.689
Can you make it a double?

04:40.691 --> 04:41.960
Gotcha.

04:42.693 --> 04:44.294
I'm not that boring,
am I?

04:44.296 --> 04:45.630
Oh...

04:46.198 --> 04:47.830
Sorry, no. I just...

04:47.832 --> 04:50.333
I don't work tomorrow, so I
figure what's the harm, right?

04:50.335 --> 04:51.134
I guess so.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.603
You should drink with me, though.
Whisky's the best.

04:54.605 --> 04:56.006
I still have to
drive you home later.

04:56.008 --> 04:57.274
Come on.
We'll take a taxi.

04:57.276 --> 04:58.174
Whatever.

04:58.176 --> 05:00.444
I'd really prefer to have
my own car.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.582
Okay, if that's the way
you feel...

05:05.784 --> 05:08.184
Hey, people like you are
the reason I have a job, right?

05:09.654 --> 05:11.453
Nice and easy.

05:11.455 --> 05:13.356
It's easy!
I'm easy.

05:13.358 --> 05:16.693
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

05:16.695 --> 05:17.626
- This way.
- I can make it!

05:17.628 --> 05:19.129
You know I can make my way.

05:19.131 --> 05:20.363
I know my way.

05:20.365 --> 05:21.998
I can open doors myself,
you know?

05:22.000 --> 05:22.832
I know.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.101
And the arm
around the shoulder?

05:25.103 --> 05:26.202
It's for your protection.

05:26.204 --> 05:28.939
- That's what I have...
- Whoa, stand up straight.

05:28.941 --> 05:30.974
- ...this for.
- Whoa! Are you serious?!

05:30.976 --> 05:32.876
It's fine.
I have a conceal and carry.

05:32.878 --> 05:34.210
Yeah. Emphasis on conceal.

05:34.212 --> 05:35.378
It...

05:35.380 --> 05:39.084
The world is a dangerous place
for a woman.

05:40.218 --> 05:42.521
Okay. Did you think
I might be dangerous?

05:43.722 --> 05:44.990
Maybe...

05:47.993 --> 05:48.792
Oh, boy.

05:48.794 --> 05:50.527
No, you're too sweet.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.666
That girl should not
have a gun on her.

05:58.637 --> 05:59.836
There you go.

05:59.838 --> 06:01.671
Damn, you're sweet.

06:04.243 --> 06:05.376
Have a good night.

06:05.378 --> 06:06.444
I'll call you
in the morning.

06:06.446 --> 06:09.313
No, no, no, no.
Stay. Stay the night.

06:09.315 --> 06:11.182
Our first time isn't
gonna be when you're hammered.

06:11.184 --> 06:13.683
- It's fine.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

06:13.685 --> 06:16.019
Come on, come on.

06:16.021 --> 06:18.054
I can't You're drunk.

06:18.056 --> 06:19.956
- That's what makes it more fun.
- I'll call you.

06:19.958 --> 06:21.760
I'll call you
in the morning.

06:22.694 --> 06:24.261
I'm sorry.

06:26.299 --> 06:28.832
Why are you being so mean?

06:28.834 --> 06:30.136
Bye.

06:38.011 --> 06:40.111
<i>Roy, I'm
glad you called me back.</i>

06:40.113 --> 06:41.711
What's going on?
Everything okay?

06:41.713 --> 06:43.147
<i>I...</i>

06:43.149 --> 06:44.882
<i>This is going to sound crazy.</i>

06:44.884 --> 06:46.951
<i>I probably shouldn't even be
freaking out like this.</i>

06:46.953 --> 06:48.752
<i>I just didn't know
who else to call.</i>

06:48.754 --> 06:50.388
What's this all about?

06:50.390 --> 06:51.721
<i>It's Jason.</i>

06:51.723 --> 06:54.758
<i>I haven't heard from him
since yesterday morning.</i>

06:54.760 --> 06:56.827
<i>I thought he wasn't texting
back because he was busy,</i>

06:56.829 --> 06:59.463
<i>but then I called him when he was
supposed to be getting off work</i>

06:59.465 --> 07:01.499
<i>and he didn't answer.</i>

07:01.501 --> 07:02.565
<i>I don't know.</i>

07:02.567 --> 07:03.968
<i>Maybe it's nothing,</i>

07:03.970 --> 07:06.237
<i>but I'm freaking out
a little bit.</i>

07:06.239 --> 07:08.139
<i>Have you seen him at all?</i>

07:08.141 --> 07:09.840
Not since the argument
last week.

07:09.842 --> 07:12.410
<i>You argued? I
didn't even know.</i>

07:12.412 --> 07:13.944
What's happening?
You dying?

07:13.946 --> 07:15.179
What? A guy can't
bring his friend

07:15.181 --> 07:18.149
his favorite
peppermint mocha cappuccino

07:18.151 --> 07:20.584
before he goes into work?

07:20.586 --> 07:22.688
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

07:23.589 --> 07:25.124
Nothing happened.

07:26.592 --> 07:28.092
What?

07:29.996 --> 07:31.297
I need a favor.

07:32.165 --> 07:33.264
It's Jason.

07:33.266 --> 07:34.065
You know.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.436
<i>Did he say anything?</i>

07:36.369 --> 07:38.369
<i>I don't know
if I did something or...</i>

07:38.371 --> 07:40.104
He didn't say anything.

07:40.106 --> 07:42.942
So, I'm planning on going
off the grid for a few days.

07:44.110 --> 07:44.975
You want me to lie to Kate?

07:44.977 --> 07:46.478
Only if she asks.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.547
<i>Could you try
to call him for me</i>

07:48.549 --> 07:50.948
<i>and then let me know
if he's okay?</i>

07:50.950 --> 07:51.849
<i>I just need to know.</i>

07:51.851 --> 07:54.220
Yeah, I'll try... for you.

07:55.522 --> 07:57.154
I doubt he's gonna pick up
my phone call,

07:57.156 --> 07:59.558
but if he doesn't, I'll just
go straight to his place.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.626
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

08:02.628 --> 08:04.498
<i>You're a really great guy.</i>

08:06.833 --> 08:08.032
Jason!

08:11.505 --> 08:12.672
You in there?

08:18.711 --> 08:19.710
It won't be long.
I'll be back.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.012
Where are you going?

08:21.014 --> 08:21.846
You know what?

08:21.848 --> 08:23.248
Forget about it.
Don't tell me.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.715
It'll make it more difficult
when she calls.

08:24.717 --> 08:27.152
All right.
I won't tell you.

08:51.945 --> 08:53.845
- Is it another girl?
- Don't worry about it.

08:53.847 --> 08:56.748
- Is it another girl?
- I thought you didn't wanna know any details.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.550
You're right.
I don't.

08:58.552 --> 09:00.020
Fuck me.

09:21.842 --> 09:23.609
<i>Hello?</i>

09:23.611 --> 09:25.411
Hi. Is this Emilia?

09:25.413 --> 09:26.878
<i>Who is this?</i>

09:26.880 --> 09:28.648
My name's Roy. I think you
might know my friend Jason?

09:28.650 --> 09:30.416
<i>Jason...?</i>

09:30.418 --> 09:31.683
Jason Lowe.

09:31.685 --> 09:33.486
I'm at his apartment right now,
and I...

09:33.488 --> 09:35.555
...found your name and number
on a napkin.

09:35.557 --> 09:38.424
<i>Oh, that Jason.</i>

09:38.426 --> 09:40.725
<i>Uh, we were supposed to go
on a date the other day,</i>

09:40.727 --> 09:42.861
<i>but he blew me off.</i>

09:42.863 --> 09:44.029
I'm sorry he blew you off.

09:44.031 --> 09:46.031
I hope you weren't
looking forward to it.

09:46.033 --> 09:48.800
<i>I figured I would
try to get to know him.</i>

09:48.802 --> 09:50.802
<i>Thought he was kinda cute.</i>

09:50.804 --> 09:54.773
<i>Can't say I'm surprised to
find out he's just another...</i>

09:54.775 --> 09:56.975
<i>...butthead.</i>

09:56.977 --> 09:58.313
<i>Are you laughing at me?</i>

09:59.547 --> 10:02.381
I haven't heard that
term since the seventh grade.

10:02.383 --> 10:05.184
<i>I like it.
It's fitting.</i>

10:05.186 --> 10:07.088
<i>What was your name again?</i>

10:08.623 --> 10:11.424
- Roy.
- <i>Roy.</i>

10:11.426 --> 10:13.593
Listen, I know
this is a long shot,

10:13.595 --> 10:14.594
um,

10:14.596 --> 10:16.229
but would you happen to know
where Jason is?

10:16.231 --> 10:18.830
<i>I haven't heard from him.</i>

10:18.832 --> 10:21.534
<i>I wish I had,
I could have helped.</i>

10:21.536 --> 10:22.501
<i>But...</i>

10:22.503 --> 10:24.337
Well, um...

10:24.339 --> 10:25.671
...Thanks, anyway.

10:25.673 --> 10:26.939
It was nice talking to you.

10:26.941 --> 10:29.108
<i>It was nice
talking to you, too, Roy.</i>

10:29.110 --> 10:31.644
<i>Even though I should even
be up this late.</i>

10:31.646 --> 10:33.615
<i>It's way past my bedtime.</i>

10:34.449 --> 10:35.848
Good night, Emilia.

10:35.850 --> 10:37.385
<i>Good night, Roy.</i>

10:47.028 --> 10:49.395
Nothing's out of place.
His computer was still there.

10:49.397 --> 10:51.030
What about his car?

10:51.032 --> 10:52.898
That wasn't there.

10:54.335 --> 10:56.369
I don't like being
that paranoid girlfriend,

10:56.371 --> 10:58.537
you know, but...

10:58.539 --> 11:00.840
...I'm worried about him.

11:00.842 --> 11:04.711
I even tried "find my phone,"
but I guess his must be off.

11:04.713 --> 11:08.180
Yeah, my phone call went
straight to voicemail, too.

11:08.182 --> 11:09.815
You know the guy.

11:09.817 --> 11:12.220
He doesn't think of
anyone except himself.

11:13.321 --> 11:16.355
I thought
I might be important to him.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.425
It doesn't matter how many
times you tell the guy,

11:18.427 --> 11:20.860
he's going to do things
his own way.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.362
Hey, maybe he's
going Christmas shopping

11:22.364 --> 11:23.697
and he doesn't
wanna ruin the surprise.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.967
He didn't even get me
a birthday present.

11:27.969 --> 11:29.503
I finished
my Christmas shopping.

11:29.505 --> 11:30.269
Oh, yeah?

11:30.271 --> 11:32.406
You're going to love your gift.

11:32.408 --> 11:33.839
You got me a present?

11:33.841 --> 11:35.676
It's nothing really.

11:35.678 --> 11:37.045
That's sweet.

11:40.081 --> 11:42.251
What did you two argue about?

11:45.554 --> 11:47.423
You don't have to answer that.

11:50.058 --> 11:51.891
Thanks for talking to me.

11:51.893 --> 11:53.295
You don't have to thank me.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.404
Kate?

12:03.272 --> 12:04.807
The thing about Jason is...

12:05.840 --> 12:07.140
...he doesn't do stability.

12:07.142 --> 12:08.575
He's always
been one to rebel.

12:08.577 --> 12:10.243
And if that
doesn't work for you,

12:10.245 --> 12:12.047
maybe he's
not the right guy.

12:13.115 --> 12:14.981
It's disrespectful for him
to bail on you

12:14.983 --> 12:16.817
and not tell you
where he's going.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.119
I shouldn't be saying
any of this.

12:19.121 --> 12:21.054
Not my place, and all,

12:21.056 --> 12:23.056
but you're my friend, too.

12:23.058 --> 12:25.726
Probably a better one
than he is.

12:25.728 --> 12:28.128
You deserve better than someone
who's going to just treat you

12:28.130 --> 12:32.899
like some kind of toy he only makes
time for when he feels like it.

12:32.901 --> 12:34.568
So, it doesn't seem
like you're very concerned

12:34.570 --> 12:36.236
that Jason might be missing.

12:36.238 --> 12:37.537
I'm not concerned.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.106
And you've spent
this entire conversation

12:39.108 --> 12:41.143
telling me how awful
he is for me.

12:42.444 --> 12:44.111
I don't know what your game is,
but I don't like it.

12:44.113 --> 12:46.248
Oh, no, there's no game.

12:47.249 --> 12:50.083
- That looked... It's not...
- You know what?

12:50.085 --> 12:51.755
Coffee was a bad idea.

12:52.822 --> 12:54.256
Call me if you hear from Jason.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.762
Fuck.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.333
Samantha?
It's Roy.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.868
I feel really bad
about last night.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.336
I mean, the way that I left you.
I wanted to ask...

13:09.338 --> 13:10.540
Do you wanna go to lunch?

13:22.585 --> 13:24.852
Okay, I know
that you're in there.

13:24.854 --> 13:27.490
I just saw that guy leave.

13:29.459 --> 13:30.858
And?

13:30.860 --> 13:32.460
I wanted to check on you.

13:32.462 --> 13:33.994
We went out last night, and...

13:33.996 --> 13:36.664
You're the one who left.
Look.

13:36.666 --> 13:39.767
I wanted to get laid last night,
and you had some kind of...

13:39.769 --> 13:42.703
conflict of conscious
and bailed.

13:42.705 --> 13:44.039
That's not my fault.

13:44.973 --> 13:48.810
I think you mean
"conflict of conscience."

13:48.812 --> 13:50.511
Oh, my God.

13:50.513 --> 13:52.847
I almost fucked you.

13:52.849 --> 13:55.016
Thank you for
sparing me that mistake.

13:55.018 --> 13:56.484
Wait, wait!

13:56.486 --> 13:58.388
I didn't even say anything!

14:01.558 --> 14:03.326
I didn't even say anything.

14:06.563 --> 14:08.931
Did you want to try again
another time?

14:47.237 --> 14:48.704
<i>Hello?</i>

14:48.706 --> 14:51.940
Hi. It's Roy again.
From last night.

14:51.942 --> 14:53.978
<i>Well, hello!</i>

14:55.278 --> 14:57.211
This is completely crazy,

14:57.213 --> 14:59.113
um...

14:59.115 --> 15:02.216
I feel really bad
about my friend standing you up.

15:02.218 --> 15:07.088
Would you-would you want to have
a do-over with me instead?

15:07.090 --> 15:09.259
I promise
I won't do the same.

15:13.297 --> 15:15.131
<i>What did you have in mind?</i>

15:18.502 --> 15:19.904
Uh...

15:26.710 --> 15:29.011
Are you Roy?

15:29.013 --> 15:30.714
You must be Emilia.

15:31.615 --> 15:34.650
Good call on the sweater.

15:34.652 --> 15:36.585
I figured if you
didn't like the look of me

15:36.587 --> 15:37.886
you could just
pretend you were alone

15:37.888 --> 15:39.621
and never have to speak to me.

15:39.623 --> 15:42.126
Why wouldn't
I like the look of you?

15:43.193 --> 15:44.762
We've never met 'til now.

15:45.663 --> 15:47.364
I like the way you look.

15:47.965 --> 15:50.599
You look... fun.

15:53.004 --> 15:54.138
I'll take that.

15:55.072 --> 15:58.240
No, I live with
my brother, actually.

15:58.242 --> 16:01.076
We inhabited the house
after my parents died.

16:01.078 --> 16:03.679
Do you mean "inherited"?

16:03.681 --> 16:04.948
Probably.

16:04.950 --> 16:07.349
I-I get that one wrong.

16:07.351 --> 16:09.418
You probably inhabited it, too.

16:09.420 --> 16:12.055
Don't worry.
The other day I said "appetizer"

16:12.057 --> 16:13.890
instead of "appraisal."

16:13.892 --> 16:16.694
That customer was very confused.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.330
Thanks.

16:20.197 --> 16:22.230
Sorry to hear
about your parents.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.367
They must have been young. How
old were you when they passed?

16:25.369 --> 16:28.236
Um, I was really little.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.808
Six years old.

16:31.943 --> 16:34.644
That's horrible. We don't
have to talk about this.

16:34.646 --> 16:36.313
Okay.

16:38.016 --> 16:40.484
What's your favorite part
about Christmas?

16:41.385 --> 16:43.586
I like spending time
with my family...

16:43.588 --> 16:46.055
I mean, it's the only time
of year I get to see my parents.

16:46.057 --> 16:47.322
People I don't
get to see very often.

16:47.324 --> 16:49.060
I just like the togetherness.

16:49.961 --> 16:51.728
I'm not making this
any better, am I?

16:51.730 --> 16:53.999
It's okay.
I don't mind.

16:55.332 --> 16:57.569
What's your favorite part
about Christmas?

17:00.372 --> 17:03.406
I love decorating.

17:03.408 --> 17:06.208
Stringing up the lights,
hanging the wreaths

17:06.210 --> 17:08.877
and, oh, putting the ornaments
on the tree.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.515
And I love the music.

17:12.517 --> 17:17.753
I love dancing and singing
and making cookies.

17:17.756 --> 17:18.855
Every year,

17:18.857 --> 17:20.390
my brother takes me out

17:20.392 --> 17:22.191
and I pick out my present

17:22.193 --> 17:25.294
and then he always
gets it for me.

17:25.296 --> 17:27.296
He seems like
a really good brother.

17:27.298 --> 17:28.698
The best.

17:28.700 --> 17:31.367
And it's just been the two of you
since you were six years old?

17:31.369 --> 17:35.738
Oh, we had an uncle...
watch us for a while.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.306
I didn't like him.

17:37.308 --> 17:38.408
But, it's...

17:38.410 --> 17:43.880
He's gone now,
so it's just me and Edward.

17:43.882 --> 17:47.151
I don't know if I could have gone
through something like that.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.887
You must be really strong.

17:50.722 --> 17:51.991
I like you.

17:54.693 --> 17:56.128
I like you, too.

17:56.896 --> 18:00.097
I actually have to go.

18:00.099 --> 18:02.398
But you should come over
for dinner tonight.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.801
Tonight?

18:03.803 --> 18:06.138
Yeah. 6:30.

18:07.305 --> 18:09.139
Well, I guess I don't
have anything going on today.

18:09.141 --> 18:12.076
I can call you later
with the address.

18:12.078 --> 18:14.379
Okay, that sounds great.

18:15.681 --> 18:18.148
- I'll see you tonight!
- Okay.

18:18.150 --> 18:19.484
Bye.

18:19.785 --> 18:21.187
Bye.

18:27.459 --> 18:28.926
Where are we going?

18:28.928 --> 18:31.362
I have to stop at the pharmacy
for a couple minutes.

18:32.531 --> 18:34.098
Better make it fast.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.666
I don't wanna wait
in the car too long.

18:35.668 --> 18:37.603
I'll go as fast as I can.
I promise.

18:41.306 --> 18:43.042
Did you like him?

18:44.110 --> 18:45.175
Yeah.

18:45.177 --> 18:48.712
Well, maybe next year,
if you still like him,

18:48.714 --> 18:49.882
I'll get him for you.

18:51.383 --> 18:52.818
Yeah...

18:57.456 --> 18:58.756
How long?

18:58.758 --> 19:01.759
I just have to pick up a couple samples.
10 minutes, tops.

19:01.761 --> 19:03.494
Or less.
I don't know.

19:03.496 --> 19:05.195
I want to go home
and play with my toy.

19:05.197 --> 19:06.632
I know you do.

19:10.903 --> 19:12.302
Stay in the car.

19:24.184 --> 19:25.351
Yay!

19:58.018 --> 19:59.349
Hi.

19:59.351 --> 20:00.352
Hi!

20:01.888 --> 20:03.453
Are you all alone?

20:03.455 --> 20:04.590
No.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.525
Good morning.

20:08.527 --> 20:10.230
What can we get filled
for you today?

20:37.057 --> 20:38.389
Are you okay?

20:38.391 --> 20:41.292
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

20:41.294 --> 20:43.061
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.729
Whoosh!

20:44.731 --> 20:47.165
Shh...

20:47.167 --> 20:48.466
See?

20:48.468 --> 20:49.968
That didn't take so long.

20:49.970 --> 20:52.804
Good. Can we go home
and play now?

20:52.806 --> 20:54.306
What is with you today?

21:16.897 --> 21:18.765
Are you gonna help me
with any of this?!

21:21.369 --> 21:22.533
No.

21:58.673 --> 22:01.842
I have a surprise for you!

22:03.644 --> 22:04.712
I don't want it.

22:05.980 --> 22:09.083
Fine.
I won't spoil it, then.

22:10.318 --> 22:13.285
How about we
play a game instead?

22:13.287 --> 22:15.854
Don't you like it
when we play games?

22:15.856 --> 22:18.726
Go... fuck yourself.

22:20.061 --> 22:22.194
That's not a very nice
thing to say.

22:39.580 --> 22:41.316
Now you play.

22:42.384 --> 22:47.119
I can't even...
I can't even move.

22:47.121 --> 22:48.789
I'll help you.

23:00.801 --> 23:02.770
You can't do this forever.

23:04.373 --> 23:06.375
Who said anything about forever?

23:08.076 --> 23:10.245
You're my Christmas toy.

23:18.519 --> 23:20.588
That hat looks so good on you!

23:22.391 --> 23:24.059
What do you wanna play?!

23:26.294 --> 23:28.962
Are you ticklish?!

23:32.167 --> 23:33.900
I know you like it,

23:33.902 --> 23:35.768
- or why would you be laughing?!
- Stop it!

23:35.770 --> 23:38.306
What do you want to do, then?!

23:40.842 --> 23:43.512
I just wanna go home.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.613
I don't think
you'll feel that way...

23:47.615 --> 23:49.449
...after you see
what I got for you.

24:31.327 --> 24:32.727
What are you looking at?

24:35.664 --> 24:36.865
I'm waiting.

24:37.666 --> 24:38.733
For what?

24:39.535 --> 24:41.002
It's a surprise.

24:41.937 --> 24:44.005
You know I don't like surprises.

24:53.014 --> 24:54.783
You have to...

24:56.486 --> 24:59.388
...set a third place at dinner.

25:00.922 --> 25:02.191
What are you talking about?

25:03.359 --> 25:05.593
I invited a guest.

25:05.595 --> 25:07.330
You invited a guest?

25:08.164 --> 25:09.096
What the fuck
were you thinking?

25:09.098 --> 25:11.731
- I just wanted to have...
- No!

25:11.733 --> 25:13.766
Who did you even invite?!

25:13.768 --> 25:15.436
- Roy.
- Roy?

25:15.438 --> 25:17.071
From coffee, Roy?

25:17.073 --> 25:19.874
I told you next year!

25:19.876 --> 25:23.210
But he's friends with Jason.

25:23.212 --> 25:25.712
I thought
they could play together.

25:25.714 --> 25:27.882
You have no idea
how bad this is.

25:27.884 --> 25:31.285
If Roy finds out
Jason is here...

25:31.287 --> 25:33.154
Call him and tell him
not to come.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.824
Do it now!

25:36.259 --> 25:40.396
- But he-he's 10 minutes away.
- Fuck!

25:41.731 --> 25:44.198
I-I'm sorry.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.234
I don't want us
to get in trouble.

25:55.378 --> 25:57.146
We're not gonna
get into trouble.

25:59.482 --> 26:00.883
I'll take care of it.

26:38.455 --> 26:40.457
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.627
It's just
for a little while longer.

26:46.129 --> 26:47.429
How are you feeling?

26:50.267 --> 26:53.970
How the fuck...
do you think I'm feeling?

26:55.771 --> 26:59.641
You're right, you're right.

27:24.301 --> 27:27.037
Again? Do you really want
to die or starvation?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.305
Well, you're never gonna
get out of here

27:30.307 --> 27:33.477
if you die of hunger.

27:34.978 --> 27:37.545
There you go.

27:37.547 --> 27:39.583
That's a good boy.

27:43.053 --> 27:44.953
If you let me go,

27:44.955 --> 27:47.188
I won't tell anyone
what happened.

27:47.190 --> 27:50.493
I won't tell.
I'll just live my life.

27:50.495 --> 27:53.328
Emilia would kill me
if I let you go.

27:53.330 --> 27:55.500
You're her favorite toy.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.235
How the fuck can you let her
get away with this shit?

28:00.237 --> 28:04.839
Whoa, whoa, hey. Be careful!

28:04.841 --> 28:06.843
Careful.

28:10.847 --> 28:13.048
Do you have a fever?

28:13.050 --> 28:14.215
Hmm.

28:14.217 --> 28:16.285
We're gonna have
to take care of that.

28:25.263 --> 28:27.231
I have a favor to ask.

28:28.865 --> 28:31.434
We have a guest
coming tonight...

28:31.436 --> 28:32.934
...and I don't want to
have to gag you.

28:32.936 --> 28:34.370
You need me to be quiet.

28:34.372 --> 28:37.906
Yeah. I'll do it for you.

28:37.908 --> 28:40.044
If you help me get out of here.

28:40.877 --> 28:43.081
I can't promise you that.

28:44.782 --> 28:46.415
There you go.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.951
Yeah.

28:52.123 --> 28:53.825
Are you going to be quiet?

28:55.560 --> 28:57.495
I can't promise you that.

29:01.132 --> 29:03.599
Why do you-
why do you do this for her?

29:03.601 --> 29:06.137
She's my sister.

29:07.305 --> 29:10.573
Your sister is insane.

29:17.582 --> 29:20.485
Don't talk about her
like that.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.016
You literally live
off the map.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.151
Hello?

30:27.753 --> 30:29.555
- Emilia?
- Hey!

30:30.222 --> 30:31.688
Hi!

30:31.690 --> 30:33.223
You must be Emilia's brother.

30:33.225 --> 30:34.758
Edward, yeah.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.725
And you're Roy.

30:35.727 --> 30:37.227
That's me.

30:37.229 --> 30:38.395
It's great to meet you.

30:38.397 --> 30:39.930
The house is over here.

30:39.932 --> 30:41.064
I thought I heard something.

30:41.066 --> 30:43.333
Thought maybe Emilia
was in there.

30:43.335 --> 30:44.734
She's inside.

30:44.736 --> 30:45.939
Oh.

30:46.738 --> 30:48.338
You look familiar.
Have we met?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.606
I doubt it.

30:49.608 --> 30:52.342
I could swear I've
seen you somewhere.

30:52.344 --> 30:54.544
Were you in the pharmacy
this morning?

30:54.546 --> 30:55.479
No.

30:55.481 --> 30:57.447
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

30:57.449 --> 30:59.751
I guess so.

31:02.554 --> 31:04.621
You wanna come inside
and see Emilia?

31:04.623 --> 31:06.826
Yes, that would be perfect.

31:08.093 --> 31:11.363
Oh, Emilia!
Your little friend is here.

31:16.435 --> 31:17.467
Hi.

31:17.469 --> 31:19.069
Hi.

31:19.071 --> 31:21.404
It's good to see you again.
You look beautiful.

31:21.406 --> 31:22.876
Thanks.

31:30.249 --> 31:31.214
Follow me.

31:31.216 --> 31:32.249
Where are we going?

31:32.251 --> 31:33.620
You'll see.

31:39.959 --> 31:43.128
I love Christmas more than
anything in the world.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.204
Sit down.

31:53.105 --> 31:55.408
I wanna
show you something special.

33:43.984 --> 33:46.451
Is everything okay
with your brother?

33:46.453 --> 33:47.488
What do you mean?

33:48.389 --> 33:51.222
I don't know,
he just seems... off.

33:51.224 --> 33:54.226
He's got a lot on his mind.

33:54.228 --> 33:57.031
And he worries about me.

33:58.132 --> 33:59.464
Hmm.

34:08.143 --> 34:11.311
Actually, could you point me
to the bathroom?

34:54.521 --> 34:55.790
What the...

34:56.824 --> 34:58.658
What are you doing in here?

34:58.660 --> 35:00.394
Uh...

35:01.428 --> 35:03.096
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

35:03.098 --> 35:06.498
This clearly isn't the bathroom.
This is my workspace.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.934
I know.
I was curious.

35:07.936 --> 35:10.203
Well, you shouldn't be in here
without a mask.

35:10.205 --> 35:11.740
Oh.
Should I be taking something?

35:12.941 --> 35:15.007
You didn't eat anything
while you were in here, did you?

35:15.009 --> 35:16.809
No, of course not.

35:16.811 --> 35:18.378
Well then, you should be fine.

35:20.582 --> 35:22.380
The bathroom's this way.

35:35.096 --> 35:36.798
Just stay for dinner.

35:47.475 --> 35:49.408
What do you think?

35:49.410 --> 35:51.344
About what?

35:51.346 --> 35:52.514
Roy.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.385
I want him.

35:58.853 --> 36:00.655
I thought so.

36:01.890 --> 36:04.390
Is that okay?

36:12.767 --> 36:14.203
Do you mean it?

36:17.505 --> 36:19.273
Merry Christmas.

36:25.981 --> 36:29.382
Roy, I want to show you
something outside.

36:29.384 --> 36:31.018
Okay. Cool.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.654
Dinner in 15.

36:33.255 --> 36:34.687
Looking forward to it.

36:40.129 --> 36:42.164
Hmm.

36:49.972 --> 36:52.773
Those don't even look safe.
Do you swing on those?

36:52.775 --> 36:54.610
Obviously.

37:05.254 --> 37:07.420
Do you get a lot
of visitors out here?

37:07.422 --> 37:10.826
No, not many.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.127
I have to invite them

37:14.129 --> 37:17.130
and I'm not allowed to have
too many people come over.

37:17.132 --> 37:18.334
Aren't allowed?

37:19.535 --> 37:23.904
Edward says you never know
what people are capable of.

37:23.906 --> 37:25.606
He's right about that.

37:27.710 --> 37:29.576
You've lived here
your entire life?

37:29.578 --> 37:30.978
Yup.

37:30.980 --> 37:33.916
At least as long
as I can remember.

37:35.017 --> 37:37.584
Do you work?
Do you have a job?

37:37.586 --> 37:38.721
No.

37:39.622 --> 37:41.989
It would be too hard
for me and Edward

37:41.991 --> 37:44.091
to both have jobs,

37:44.093 --> 37:46.462
since we only have
the one car.

37:47.563 --> 37:49.997
So when he goes to work
you go with him?

37:49.999 --> 37:51.165
Well...

37:51.167 --> 37:53.303
He usually just works from home.

37:54.337 --> 37:57.673
He does some kind of research
with medicine.

37:58.807 --> 38:01.144
I don't really understand it.

38:03.445 --> 38:06.513
So when we met
for coffee this morning...

38:06.515 --> 38:07.951
...was he with you?

38:09.852 --> 38:11.121
Yeah.

38:12.588 --> 38:16.057
He was there the whole time.

38:16.059 --> 38:18.627
Shh.

38:19.695 --> 38:21.896
I knew I knew him
from somewhere.

38:21.898 --> 38:23.730
Why did he lie about that?

38:23.732 --> 38:25.465
Well...

38:25.467 --> 38:27.467
People think it's weird,

38:27.469 --> 38:29.837
me living with him,
so...

38:29.839 --> 38:33.376
...he pretends he isn't there
when I meet people.

38:36.112 --> 38:37.814
So... where did you meet Jason?

38:38.647 --> 38:40.715
You ask so many questions!

38:40.717 --> 38:42.884
I'm serious!

38:42.886 --> 38:46.254
If you want the answer,
you have to catch me.

38:46.256 --> 38:49.123
Okay. If that's how
you're gonna play it.

38:55.432 --> 38:58.333
Got you! Now you have to
answer my question.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.702
No! Let me go!

39:00.704 --> 39:01.869
You giving up already?

39:11.715 --> 39:14.615
- I'm sorry. I thought we were...
- It's fine.

39:19.756 --> 39:25.560
I met Jason... in the
parking lot at the pharmacy.

39:25.562 --> 39:27.562
Edward was inside

39:27.564 --> 39:30.031
picking up some medicine
for work

39:30.033 --> 39:31.433
and I was waiting.

39:31.435 --> 39:34.771
Jason was walking past and....

39:35.839 --> 39:37.475
...he said I looked beautiful...

39:38.575 --> 39:40.643
...and that he'd like
to take me out.

39:41.878 --> 39:46.415
I got a napkin out of the car
and wrote my number on it.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.650
That was it.

39:48.551 --> 39:49.652
Okay.

39:50.687 --> 39:52.388
I didn't mean to scare you.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.329
Dinner's probably ready.

40:02.299 --> 40:04.266
We'll start with this.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.601
The ham will be ready
any minute.

40:06.603 --> 40:08.937
I was just telling Emilia
how amazing everything looks.

40:08.939 --> 40:11.040
Well, it tastes even better.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.276
Can't wait.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.679
Wait!

40:17.314 --> 40:18.981
It's almost Christmas.

40:18.983 --> 40:21.116
We have to say
what we're thankful for.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.386
I'll start.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.754
I'm thankful for

40:25.756 --> 40:27.322
this delicious food

40:27.324 --> 40:29.058
that's on the table
in front of us.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.526
And...

40:30.528 --> 40:35.197
...also I'm thankful that Roy could
join us and make it for dinner.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.434
We're both really glad
to have you here.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.703
And I'm thankful that it's my
favorite time of the year!

40:41.705 --> 40:44.807
Everything is good
at Christmas time.

40:44.809 --> 40:47.812
Okay!
Edward, you're next.

40:49.647 --> 40:51.182
I...

40:54.618 --> 40:57.321
...am thankful
for my sister, Emilia.

40:58.756 --> 41:01.790
You've been the brightest part of
my life for a long, long time.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.994
Seeing you happy
is what I live for.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.832
I would do anything for you.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.834
So I'm thankful
that you're in my life,

41:11.836 --> 41:13.838
and that you keep me focused
on the good things.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.039
I'm also thankful that the
horrible, negative people

41:17.041 --> 41:20.310
who used to be in our lives are
no longer a part of this family.

41:20.312 --> 41:21.979
Oh, me too!

41:23.215 --> 41:26.182
- So...
- Roy?

41:26.184 --> 41:29.285
Right! It's my turn.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.986
Um...

41:30.988 --> 41:34.690
I'm thankful to both of you for
allowing me into your house

41:34.692 --> 41:35.860
this close to Christmas.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.131
I'm thankful for this food
you've put in front of me.

41:40.532 --> 41:43.233
I'm thankful to have met Emilia,

41:43.235 --> 41:44.567
who really is a sweetheart.

41:45.803 --> 41:49.539
And I'm thankful to know that
my family is alive and well,

41:49.541 --> 41:53.409
and I know they can't wait to see me when I
come home for Christmas in a couple days.

41:53.411 --> 41:56.479
You're supposed to see your
family in a couple days?

41:56.481 --> 41:58.448
I go home every year
for Christmas.

41:58.450 --> 42:00.018
I think
I told you that this morning.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.955
Have you ever
missed a Christmas?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.890
Not since my first year
out of college.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.393
My mother was furious.

42:10.395 --> 42:12.428
She took a picture
of my empty chair and wrote,

42:12.430 --> 42:14.998
"How about we just invite
the dog to come and eat?"

42:29.181 --> 42:30.614
I think everybody
else understood,

42:30.616 --> 42:32.315
but that didn't stop
the angry phone calls.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.783
Even if I didn't want to,

42:33.785 --> 42:36.620
I'd still go back just to prevent all
the bad blood for the next year.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.421
Oh.

42:38.423 --> 42:41.424
I wouldn't want your family
to be mad at you.

42:41.426 --> 42:42.692
They won't be.

42:42.694 --> 42:45.028
Because I'm going to go home
and spend Christmas with them.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.229
Roy?

42:46.231 --> 42:48.666
Anything else you're thankful for?
Or can we dig in?

42:48.668 --> 42:50.233
I'm done.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.971
Emilia, anything else
you wanted to do?

42:54.540 --> 42:56.839
Do you think Mom and Dad

42:56.841 --> 43:00.678
would have been sad if we
weren't at Christmas?

43:00.680 --> 43:02.078
What?

43:02.080 --> 43:04.615
I shouldn't have mentioned my parents.
I wasn't even thinking.

43:04.617 --> 43:06.617
How sad do you think
Mom and Dad would have been

43:06.619 --> 43:09.553
if they had Christmas
and we weren't there?

43:09.555 --> 43:11.422
Probably very sad.

43:11.424 --> 43:12.489
But it never happened.

43:12.491 --> 43:13.923
In fact,
the exact opposite happened.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.594
We've had lots and lots of
Christmases without Mom and Dad.

43:16.596 --> 43:18.195
I know!

43:18.197 --> 43:20.797
And it always makes me sad.

43:20.799 --> 43:22.799
I never thought about it
like that before.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.768
You shouldn't think about it!
You should be happy.

43:25.770 --> 43:26.670
We have a guest.

43:26.672 --> 43:27.971
Maybe we shouldn't.

43:27.973 --> 43:30.174
Maybe we shouldn't
have any more guests.

43:30.176 --> 43:31.342
Emilia, do you want me to leave?

43:31.344 --> 43:32.476
Shut up, Roy.

43:33.579 --> 43:34.580
Everything is okay.

43:36.148 --> 43:40.219
Mom and Dad are watching us, and they're
very happy that we're doing well.

43:43.956 --> 43:46.726
- You really think so?
- Yes!

43:50.963 --> 43:52.496
Okay.

43:56.102 --> 43:57.536
I didn't mean to offend anyone.

43:59.171 --> 44:01.505
Again, I can leave
if you want me to.

44:01.507 --> 44:03.476
- It seems like you two...
- I don't want you to leave!

44:10.549 --> 44:11.683
Then I'll stay.

44:28.401 --> 44:30.100
Mmh.

44:31.170 --> 44:32.436
Edward, you weren't lying.

44:32.438 --> 44:33.505
This soup is delicious.

44:33.507 --> 44:35.205
Thank you!

44:35.207 --> 44:36.541
You're welcome, Roy.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.510
Do you really like the soup,

44:38.512 --> 44:40.077
or are you just saying that?

44:40.079 --> 44:41.579
I like the soup.

44:41.581 --> 44:44.482
Because you don't have to eat
it if you don't like it.

44:44.484 --> 44:46.285
I really like it.

44:47.286 --> 44:51.358
Oh, okay. Good.

44:53.760 --> 44:54.858
Everything okay?

44:54.860 --> 44:58.465
Emilia, everything's okay,
correct?

45:04.771 --> 45:06.473
- Ooh!
- Oh.

45:07.774 --> 45:08.972
That scared me.

45:17.250 --> 45:18.819
Let's talk
about something happy.

45:19.786 --> 45:21.254
What's your happiest moment?

45:22.855 --> 45:25.557
There was one night,

45:25.559 --> 45:27.958
right after our uncle left,
and...

45:27.960 --> 45:30.028
...Edward took me outside and...

45:30.030 --> 45:32.097
...he put down a blanket and...

45:32.099 --> 45:34.432
...we laid down
and looked at the stars.

45:34.434 --> 45:37.602
And he told me that everything
was gonna be happy from now on.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.070
That no matter what happened,

45:39.072 --> 45:41.139
he would take care of me.

45:41.141 --> 45:44.709
And then we saw a shooting star,

45:44.711 --> 45:49.114
and he said that
that was probably our uncle,

45:49.116 --> 45:53.051
running away to be somewhere he
could finally be all alone, and...

45:53.053 --> 45:56.421
...not have to put up with
us stupid kids anymore.

45:56.423 --> 46:00.091
And Edward, he promised me that
there was a medicine I could take

46:00.093 --> 46:02.327
that could make me happy
all the time, so...

46:02.329 --> 46:05.597
...I wouldn't have to be sad
about anything ever again.

46:05.599 --> 46:08.133
And he promised he would
get it for me, and...

46:08.135 --> 46:12.270
...I knew that he really,
really meant it.

46:14.842 --> 46:16.274
That sounds really nice of him.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.442
It was.

46:17.444 --> 46:18.711
Here's the ham!

46:18.713 --> 46:20.713
Now, you both finish your soup

46:20.715 --> 46:21.714
and you can have some.

46:23.584 --> 46:25.350
Emilia was just telling me
about the promise

46:25.352 --> 46:27.820
you made her
after your uncle left.

46:27.822 --> 46:31.891
Which part? The medicine, or that
I would always be there for her?

46:31.893 --> 46:33.391
Both.

46:33.393 --> 46:34.729
Hmm.

46:36.029 --> 46:38.963
I've always been
interested in medicine.

46:38.965 --> 46:42.233
It fascinated me that we could
be sick, and then take a pill,

46:42.235 --> 46:43.602
and we would start
to get better.

46:43.604 --> 46:45.970
That there were things
outside of our bodies

46:45.972 --> 46:47.473
that we could put
into our bodies

46:47.475 --> 46:49.941
that would start to fix us.

46:49.943 --> 46:51.677
And I began to wonder

46:51.679 --> 46:54.946
what else I could fix
about myself.

46:54.948 --> 46:57.583
About Emilia. About everyone.

46:57.585 --> 46:59.017
So I began reading.

46:59.019 --> 47:03.689
I learned about a lot of different
medications for all sorts of things.

47:03.691 --> 47:06.592
Things you never thought
a drug could be used for.

47:06.594 --> 47:08.494
Like what?

47:08.496 --> 47:09.895
Well, the basics...

47:09.897 --> 47:13.265
...acetaminophen, diazepam,
haloperidol...

47:13.267 --> 47:15.367
...stopping a fever,

47:15.369 --> 47:18.372
pain relief, mental illness.

47:19.340 --> 47:22.074
There's erectile dysfunction,
obviously.

47:24.045 --> 47:26.512
Then there's
the really fascinating stuff.

47:26.514 --> 47:28.047
I never knew that you
could take a pill

47:28.049 --> 47:32.117
that would change
the way you see the world.

47:32.119 --> 47:34.720
Steroids, opiates,
hallucinogens.

47:34.722 --> 47:37.858
There are drugs that makes it
so you can't feel pain.

47:37.860 --> 47:39.758
Drugs that make you forget.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.393
Drugs that make you tired.

47:43.531 --> 47:47.366
So now Edward
works with medicine.

47:47.368 --> 47:48.802
You started taking medicine
after that?

47:48.804 --> 47:50.236
Every day.

47:50.238 --> 47:51.403
How old were you
when this happened?

47:51.405 --> 47:53.005
She was 12.
I was 17.

47:53.007 --> 47:54.875
That's awfully young
to be taking medication.

47:54.877 --> 47:57.142
Well, we both turned out okay.

47:57.144 --> 47:59.946
Yeah, you two
seem really normal.

47:59.948 --> 48:02.581
Roy! What do you want to do
after dinner?

48:02.583 --> 48:04.618
Oh, Emilia.
Give the guy a break.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.285
I figure I'd head home.

48:06.287 --> 48:07.854
Start packing.

48:07.856 --> 48:09.388
Do you have to?

48:09.390 --> 48:12.959
Let's just wait and see
how he feels after dinner.

48:12.961 --> 48:14.628
Okay.

48:14.630 --> 48:20.634
I just thought he might want to
play with my Christmas present.

48:20.636 --> 48:23.436
That's right.
The one you opened early.

48:23.438 --> 48:24.203
What is it?

48:24.205 --> 48:27.007
Don't spoil the surprise.

48:27.009 --> 48:28.842
I won't.

48:28.844 --> 48:30.644
I think you're really
going to like it.

48:30.646 --> 48:32.111
Yeah?

48:32.113 --> 48:34.648
Yeah! I think you might even
want to stay

48:34.650 --> 48:38.150
and play with
it for a really long time.

48:40.422 --> 48:41.523
Sounds fun.

48:48.162 --> 48:50.095
Looks like I'm
ready for a piece of that ham.

48:50.097 --> 48:51.833
So you are.

48:54.101 --> 48:55.535
Mmh.

49:10.852 --> 49:12.454
Roy?

49:15.557 --> 49:18.061
Sorry. I don't know
what just happened.

49:19.996 --> 49:22.997
- - Emilia? Some ham?
- Yes, please.

49:24.499 --> 49:27.235
- - Emilia? Some ham?
- Yes, please.

49:31.007 --> 49:32.372
Thank you very much.

49:32.374 --> 49:34.407
I'm glad your mood has improved.

49:34.409 --> 49:36.978
Well, I just remembered
how much fun

49:36.980 --> 49:39.312
Roy is
going to have with my toy.

49:39.314 --> 49:40.982
Hmm.

49:40.984 --> 49:42.215
Where is this toy?

49:42.217 --> 49:43.720
In the garage.

49:45.287 --> 49:47.354
So it's a big toy.

49:47.356 --> 49:50.091
It's really big.

49:55.064 --> 49:56.664
I love your giggle.

49:56.666 --> 49:58.065
You do?

49:58.067 --> 49:59.667
It's adorable.

49:59.669 --> 50:01.501
Now you sound like Jason.

50:11.748 --> 50:14.649
Is that what Jason said to you
in the parking lot

50:14.651 --> 50:17.418
when you met him
at the pharmacy?

50:17.420 --> 50:19.354
Yeah, yes.

50:20.322 --> 50:24.592
I laughed.
When he was asking me out I...

50:24.594 --> 50:27.463
I laughed, or giggled.

50:28.564 --> 50:30.400
He said he loved it.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.434
Sounds just like Jason.

50:33.436 --> 50:35.203
Always the smooth talker.

50:36.406 --> 50:38.773
I never did meet this Jason guy.

50:38.775 --> 50:41.711
No, you wouldn't have.

50:43.279 --> 50:45.079
He's something else.

50:45.081 --> 50:47.214
I just feel bad
for his girlfriend.

50:49.318 --> 50:51.654
It's probably for the best
you never met.

50:59.063 --> 51:01.762
This ham is really delicious.

51:01.764 --> 51:03.999
Thank you, Roy.

51:04.001 --> 51:06.103
I spent a lot of time on it.

51:09.006 --> 51:11.106
I almost forgot, Emilia,

51:11.108 --> 51:13.374
I got you a Christmas present,
but I...

51:13.376 --> 51:15.209
...left it in the car.

51:15.211 --> 51:18.713
Oh, you didn't
have to get me anything.

51:18.715 --> 51:21.315
I know, but I wanted
to get you something as a...

51:21.317 --> 51:24.285
...as a thank you for inviting
me over for dinner tonight.

51:24.287 --> 51:26.387
I can go grab it...

51:26.389 --> 51:28.456
...and then you can show me
your Christmas present!

51:28.458 --> 51:30.624
What a fantastic idea.

51:57.988 --> 51:58.987
I'm sorry.

51:58.989 --> 52:00.354
I had to.

52:07.396 --> 52:09.865
You killed him!
You killed him!

52:09.867 --> 52:10.866
I had to.

52:10.868 --> 52:12.134
I had to.

52:12.136 --> 52:13.537
Why!?

52:14.471 --> 52:17.572
He was going to stay here
and be my toy!

52:17.574 --> 52:18.874
It was the only way.

52:22.813 --> 52:25.647
I don't understand
why you had to kill him!

52:25.649 --> 52:27.349
Put him up on the table.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.053
Pull him.

52:36.426 --> 52:39.162
What are we going
to do with him?

52:39.164 --> 52:42.165
He isn't going to make it
home for Christmas.

52:42.167 --> 52:44.666
His family is
gonna be so mad at him.

52:44.668 --> 52:46.802
Don't worry about his family
right now, Emilia.

52:46.804 --> 52:48.906
We need to deal with this.

52:49.773 --> 52:52.277
Don't let him
fall off the table.

52:54.378 --> 52:55.944
What are you going to do
with that?!

52:55.946 --> 52:57.579
He'll be easier to bury.
And harder to find.

52:59.449 --> 53:01.184
You're going to bury him?!

53:01.186 --> 53:03.485
I really wish you didn't
have to see this right now.

53:03.487 --> 53:05.087
But this is what happens

53:05.089 --> 53:06.655
when you do things
without telling me first.

53:06.657 --> 53:07.892
Do you understand?

53:09.526 --> 53:11.395
This is my fault.

53:12.429 --> 53:13.996
Don't think about it that way.

53:13.998 --> 53:18.567
This is what happens when toys stop
working the way they're supposed to.

53:18.569 --> 53:20.870
Is this what happened
to all my other toys?

53:20.872 --> 53:23.538
You have to understand,
when somebody becomes a toy,

53:23.540 --> 53:25.174
the rules change.

53:25.176 --> 53:26.374
You can't murder a toy.

53:26.376 --> 53:27.509
I didn't kill Roy.

53:29.613 --> 53:31.613
Is this going
to happen to Jason?

53:31.615 --> 53:33.249
When he stops working
the way he's supposed to,

53:33.251 --> 53:34.650
but as long
as I give him medicine,

53:34.652 --> 53:37.053
you'll be able to play with him
a while longer.

53:55.473 --> 53:58.441
- Is it another girl?
- I thought you didn't want to know any details.

53:58.443 --> 54:00.843
You're right, I don't. But if
you're fucking around on Kate...

54:00.845 --> 54:02.478
What does it matter to you?

54:02.480 --> 54:04.146
It really feels like you're not
on my side here.

54:04.148 --> 54:05.548
Why does there have to be sides?

54:05.550 --> 54:06.616
I don't know!

54:06.618 --> 54:08.751
Why are you taking one?
And why isn't it mine?

54:08.753 --> 54:10.820
I'm not saying
that's what's happening.

54:10.822 --> 54:13.656
I'm just saying,
if you are cheating...

54:13.658 --> 54:16.726
It's like you're in love with my
girlfriend, or something.

54:16.728 --> 54:18.696
You in love with my girlfriend,
Roy?

54:24.802 --> 54:28.504
Oh, my...
This explains so much.

54:28.506 --> 54:29.507
Drop it.

54:30.808 --> 54:32.975
You don't have to worry about it
'cause it's not another girl.

54:32.977 --> 54:34.677
I wish I could believe that.

54:34.679 --> 54:36.746
Fucking hell, Roy.

54:36.748 --> 54:40.950
I came here to give you a heads up.
I'm not even sure if I'm going.

54:40.952 --> 54:42.019
You know, you don't deserve her.

54:42.021 --> 54:43.287
I know.

54:43.289 --> 54:45.355
And if this "going off the grid"
thing doesn't work out...

54:45.357 --> 54:47.157
What?

54:47.159 --> 54:48.858
You'll what?

54:48.860 --> 54:50.027
Huh?

54:50.029 --> 54:52.996
You think if Kate weren't
with me, she'd be with you?

54:52.998 --> 54:54.497
- She'd never be with you.
- Fuck you!

54:54.499 --> 54:56.001
You know I'm right.

54:57.568 --> 55:00.137
- I'm not lying for you anymore.
- Then don't!

55:00.139 --> 55:02.041
She'll hate you, too.

55:02.908 --> 55:05.474
Fuck, Roy.

55:05.476 --> 55:07.413
I'm not going to fight with you
like this.

55:08.546 --> 55:11.348
I came over here to give you
coffee and doughnuts,

55:11.350 --> 55:13.951
and you're dropping bombs
on me, man.

55:13.953 --> 55:16.654
You're supposed to be
my best friend.

55:20.658 --> 55:23.162
Enjoy the fucking doughnuts.

55:40.045 --> 55:44.216
So...
what was wrong with this toy?

55:45.617 --> 55:47.150
The medicine wasn't working.

55:47.152 --> 55:48.919
It was making him
into something else.

55:48.921 --> 55:50.921
Something scary.

55:50.923 --> 55:52.189
Really?

55:52.191 --> 55:53.557
Yes.

55:53.559 --> 55:55.726
I couldn't even tell.

55:55.728 --> 55:57.327
That's why you need me.

55:57.329 --> 55:59.932
To keep you safe from the
ones that don't work.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.833
It's okay.

56:02.835 --> 56:03.700
Hey.

56:03.702 --> 56:06.136
Why don't you go
and tidy up the house,

56:06.138 --> 56:08.239
and bring the knife up there,

56:08.241 --> 56:10.807
then you can come back in
and play with your toy.

56:10.809 --> 56:12.745
Might make you feel better.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.714
Here. Take the knife
back to the house.

56:17.716 --> 56:19.384
Okay.

56:19.386 --> 56:21.051
I will.

56:21.053 --> 56:22.919
Thanks.

57:45.372 --> 57:47.140
Do you know
what I learned tonight?

57:49.909 --> 57:54.178
I learned that one day...

57:54.180 --> 57:55.982
...you're going to break.

57:57.217 --> 58:00.452
And then you'll have to die...

58:00.454 --> 58:02.722
...like the rest of my toys.

58:04.325 --> 58:06.090
But that's okay.

58:06.092 --> 58:08.693
Because I'm gonna love you

58:08.695 --> 58:12.098
and play with you all the way
until that happens.

58:14.535 --> 58:16.803
<i>I didn't understand before...</i>

58:17.770 --> 58:20.074
<i>...why my toys would disappear.</i>

58:21.442 --> 58:24.911
<i>Christmas would come and go...</i>

58:26.113 --> 58:28.746
...and I'd have my toy and...

58:28.748 --> 58:32.586
...then one morning,
it would be gone.

58:34.522 --> 58:37.124
Edward always said they broke.

58:38.092 --> 58:40.758
<i>I thought that was weird,</i>

58:40.760 --> 58:44.532
<i>because I've played
with broken toys before.</i>

58:47.034 --> 58:50.471
<i>But... I get it now.</i>

58:53.007 --> 58:56.544
<i>Broken... means dead.</i>

58:58.112 --> 59:00.247
<i>Like my parents.</i>

59:03.918 --> 59:05.886
I'm going to miss you
when you break.

59:10.391 --> 59:11.992
You're fun.

59:19.833 --> 59:21.969
You want to know a secret?

59:25.540 --> 59:27.908
You're my favorite.

59:32.746 --> 59:35.914
I think I want to have some fun
right now.

59:55.069 --> 59:56.802
That feels so good.

01:00:07.115 --> 01:00:08.483
Why do you like me?

01:00:10.452 --> 01:00:11.850
Don't even ask that question.

01:00:11.852 --> 01:00:13.553
I already asked it.

01:00:13.555 --> 01:00:15.022
Well, it's a stupid question.

01:00:17.225 --> 01:00:19.125
I need an answer.

01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:24.364
I just do.

01:00:31.306 --> 01:00:33.506
Come on.
Check it later.

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:34.374
Could be important.

01:00:42.384 --> 01:00:43.683
Is it important?

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:45.587
Not in the slightest.

01:00:47.422 --> 01:00:49.088
You were right.

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:50.556
I always am.

01:01:02.638 --> 01:01:04.270
Tell me you like it.

01:01:04.272 --> 01:01:06.174
I like it a lot.

01:01:11.614 --> 01:01:14.215
Do you like when I do this?

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:17.417
You know I do.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.632
- Oh, God.
- You have to wait.

01:01:31.634 --> 01:01:32.932
Oh, yeah.

01:01:38.273 --> 01:01:40.141
What did you say?

01:01:45.348 --> 01:01:47.115
I can make it feel better.

01:01:48.284 --> 01:01:53.422
I can make the game more fun
if you help me.

01:01:58.893 --> 01:02:00.463
That feels good.

01:02:02.465 --> 01:02:04.100
Will you help me?

01:02:05.401 --> 01:02:06.767
Help you what?

01:02:06.769 --> 01:02:08.502
Get out of here.

01:02:08.504 --> 01:02:10.473
I don't want you to leave.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.907
I do.

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:16.744
What are you...

01:02:16.746 --> 01:02:18.779
I don't like that.

01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:21.348
It'll feel good.
It'll feel good, I promise.

01:02:35.631 --> 01:02:37.464
Let me try something else.

01:02:37.466 --> 01:02:39.268
- Okay?
- What?

01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:42.069
I have to get on top.

01:02:43.973 --> 01:02:46.275
I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

01:02:47.543 --> 01:02:50.012
I don't think I like
this game anymore.

01:04:12.662 --> 01:04:16.064
Fuck, yes!
Fuck, yes!

01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:28.243
Emilia...

01:04:28.245 --> 01:04:29.945
Emilia.

01:04:29.947 --> 01:04:31.181
Emilia!

01:04:32.082 --> 01:04:34.249
Why aren't you playing
with your toy?

01:04:34.251 --> 01:04:36.351
I don't want to anymore.

01:04:36.353 --> 01:04:38.721
Because now you know
what's going to happen to him?

01:04:38.723 --> 01:04:40.789
He's already broken.

01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:43.024
What do you mean, he's broken?

01:04:43.026 --> 01:04:45.126
He did what he
wasn't supposed to do.

01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:48.631
Come on. Come on, pick
up the fucking phone.

01:04:50.801 --> 01:04:52.200
Come on!

01:04:54.972 --> 01:04:57.940
Jason? Where are you!?

01:04:57.942 --> 01:05:00.910
I'm so fucking mad at you right now.
You have no idea...

01:05:00.912 --> 01:05:02.613
Help me!

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:05.948
Oh, my God, Jason?
Are you okay?

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:08.118
I'm kidnapped.

01:05:08.886 --> 01:05:10.419
Need rescue.

01:05:10.421 --> 01:05:11.754
Oh, my God! Jason!

01:05:11.756 --> 01:05:12.788
Where are you?!

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:14.255
Hurry!

01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:17.560
I need you to tell me
exactly what you mean.

01:05:17.562 --> 01:05:18.827
Is Jason alive?

01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:21.764
No, he's a toy,

01:05:21.766 --> 01:05:24.065
and he doesn't work anymore.

01:05:24.067 --> 01:05:25.469
What part doesn't work?

01:05:27.137 --> 01:05:28.906
It wasn't right!

01:05:29.774 --> 01:05:32.043
I wasn't playing with him,
he was...

01:05:34.011 --> 01:05:35.811
...playing with me!

01:05:43.654 --> 01:05:45.287
Okay, Jason,
I need you to call...

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:46.522
I need you to tell me
where you are,

01:05:46.524 --> 01:05:48.123
because I need to know
where you are

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.124
so I can come
and get you!

01:05:49.126 --> 01:05:50.626
As fast as you can.

01:05:50.628 --> 01:05:52.030
<i>I'm gonna call the police!</i>

01:05:53.364 --> 01:05:55.598
<i>Wait, wait, Jason! You have
to tell me where you are.</i>

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.968
Don't call back.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:59.201
Find my phone.

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:05.441
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:05.443 --> 01:06:08.377
- What the fuck did you do?
- Wait, wait.

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:10.312
Yes,
I'd like to report a kidnapping.

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:12.314
Uh, it's my boyfriend,
Jason Lowe...

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:13.649
He's been missing
for three days,

01:06:13.651 --> 01:06:16.218
and he just called and told me
that he'd been kidnapped!

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.455
Yes, I understand
how that sounds.

01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:23.059
Look, I would appreciate you
taking this fucking seriously!

01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:24.894
Look, okay, I have the address
where he's being held

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:26.228
and I'm gonna there now.

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.864
Fuck no,
I won't stay here!

01:06:27.866 --> 01:06:30.366
- What the fuck did you do?!
- It was an accident!

01:06:30.368 --> 01:06:32.836
- How did you get untied?
- Emilia.

01:06:32.838 --> 01:06:34.873
- Why?
- She wanted to cuddle.

01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:37.573
What are you doing
all the way over here?

01:06:37.575 --> 01:06:39.876
I didn't do anything, I swear. I
was just trying to make her happy

01:06:39.878 --> 01:06:40.910
so I didn't end up like Roy.

01:06:40.912 --> 01:06:42.177
She said you were broken.

01:06:42.179 --> 01:06:43.613
I don't know what that means.

01:06:43.615 --> 01:06:46.215
- I just tried to make her happy, I swear.
- How? How?!

01:06:46.217 --> 01:06:48.384
By giving her more pleasure.

01:06:48.386 --> 01:06:50.820
She doesn't like when things
don't play by her rules.

01:06:50.822 --> 01:06:52.555
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare her.

01:06:52.557 --> 01:06:55.525
I just wanted to make her happy!

01:06:55.527 --> 01:06:57.494
I have to tie you back up.

01:06:57.496 --> 01:07:00.397
No, please, please, please!

01:07:00.399 --> 01:07:02.732
I'm not going to do anything.
I can't do anything.

01:07:02.734 --> 01:07:05.101
It's one thing!
Just give me this one thing.

01:07:05.103 --> 01:07:06.469
- Please.
- I can't do that.

01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:08.805
Please, please, please, please.

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:10.473
I'm not gonna go anywhere!

01:07:10.475 --> 01:07:11.741
I'm not gonna do anything.
Please, please.

01:07:11.743 --> 01:07:14.010
Just this one thing.
It's one thing.

01:07:14.012 --> 01:07:16.479
Please, no.
I'll do anything.

01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:18.014
Please.

01:07:18.016 --> 01:07:18.884
I'll do anything.

01:07:19.918 --> 01:07:23.653
I know what you want.
I know what you want.

01:07:23.655 --> 01:07:24.956
I'll give it to you.

01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:29.025
Is this what you want?

01:07:29.027 --> 01:07:30.696
If you let me go.

01:07:34.399 --> 01:07:36.234
I know you want me.

01:07:36.902 --> 01:07:38.668
You can have me...

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.238
...if you help me.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.908
I know you want this.

01:07:44.443 --> 01:07:47.080
Just tell-
just tell me what you want.

01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:49.648
Tell me what you want.

01:07:50.248 --> 01:07:51.583
What are you doing?

01:07:52.584 --> 01:07:53.951
Stay there, boy.

01:07:55.554 --> 01:07:57.054
That's-that's Emilia's room.

01:07:57.056 --> 01:07:58.856
That's right.

01:07:58.858 --> 01:08:00.457
Why are you going
into Emilia's room?

01:08:00.459 --> 01:08:03.426
Go back to the livin' room, Ed!

01:08:03.428 --> 01:08:06.165
I just wanna give 'er
a little kiss.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.933
She's sleeping.

01:08:08.935 --> 01:08:10.169
Let's go to bed.

01:08:13.106 --> 01:08:15.106
Are you tryin' to fuck with me?

01:08:15.108 --> 01:08:17.042
Leave Emilia alone.

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:20.444
Fine.

01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:23.883
I'll leave her alone.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.416
You wanna be the hero,

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.720
you'll see
what happens to heroes.

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:32.225
Just remember,
you asked for this.

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.899
Tell me what you want.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.867
No!

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.037
I don't fucking want it!

01:08:56.149 --> 01:09:01.852
Come on, come on, come on!

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.667
- Edward!
- Just one minute, Emilia.

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:18.703
Are you in there?

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:22.740
Just give me a minute!

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:25.109
Edward!

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.613
Just a minute!

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.815
Please.

01:10:42.923 --> 01:10:44.224
You were right.

01:10:47.461 --> 01:10:49.630
Jason was broken.

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.799
But I know how to fix him.

01:10:53.934 --> 01:10:54.799
You do?

01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:56.036
Yeah.

01:10:57.604 --> 01:11:00.140
Just give him a little more medicine
and he'll be as good as new.

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:03.944
Made him something special.

01:11:05.313 --> 01:11:06.978
Okay.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.113
Let's go!

01:11:08.115 --> 01:11:09.284
Later.

01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:12.953
What are you doing now?

01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:16.391
Guessing.

01:11:19.327 --> 01:11:20.994
This is a big toy.

01:11:21.728 --> 01:11:23.530
It's something you asked for.

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:28.700
I don't remember asking
for anything this big.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.469
Well, you'll have to wait
'til Christmas, won't you?

01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:33.538
I don't want to wait anymore.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.410
It's just a little while longer.

01:11:38.478 --> 01:11:40.248
Do you ever think about them?

01:11:43.985 --> 01:11:45.987
Why are you asking about that?

01:11:47.621 --> 01:11:49.723
I think about them all the time.

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:53.061
You shouldn't
do that to yourself.

01:11:56.364 --> 01:11:58.364
We didn't get to say goodbye.

01:11:58.366 --> 01:12:01.035
Sometimes you don't
get to say goodbye.

01:12:03.004 --> 01:12:05.373
Like with my toys.

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:09.010
Exactly. Like with your toys.

01:12:13.014 --> 01:12:14.215
Hey.

01:12:15.116 --> 01:12:16.684
Do you want to open...

01:12:18.786 --> 01:12:20.519
Do you want to open up...

01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:21.587
...another present?

01:12:21.589 --> 01:12:23.589
I can't.

01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:25.526
It isn't Christmas yet.

01:12:26.361 --> 01:12:28.396
Well, I'm giving you permission.

01:12:35.903 --> 01:12:37.303
This one.

01:13:00.928 --> 01:13:04.131
No. No!

01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:06.932
No, no!

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.475
Emilia.

01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:16.575
Emilia, I love you.

01:13:16.577 --> 01:13:20.147
You're all I have in the world,
and I'm all you have.

01:13:33.362 --> 01:13:35.862
You're broken, Edward.

01:13:35.864 --> 01:13:38.532
And you were changing
into something scary.

01:13:38.534 --> 01:13:39.833
Like Roy.

01:13:39.835 --> 01:13:41.968
You said it's not murder.

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.604
Once someone turns into a toy,
they can't be killed.

01:13:45.606 --> 01:13:48.809
I was never a toy, Emilia.
I'm your...

01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:50.479
I'm your brother!

01:13:51.146 --> 01:13:52.913
Not anymore.

01:13:52.915 --> 01:13:55.515
You're a broken toy.

01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:06.962
You don't have to do this.

01:14:08.097 --> 01:14:09.631
We can fix me.

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:19.675
Are you fixed?

01:14:20.909 --> 01:14:22.477
Yes.

01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:23.413
Yes.

01:14:24.713 --> 01:14:26.382
Good.

01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:29.383
So, I can fix Jason.

01:14:29.385 --> 01:14:31.854
Give him-
give him this.

01:14:33.456 --> 01:14:34.855
I'll fix everything.

01:15:06.322 --> 01:15:07.856
For my own good.

01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:29.410
That's not nice.

01:15:32.649 --> 01:15:34.716
I need to fix you now.

01:15:37.453 --> 01:15:39.420
It's time to take your medicine.

01:15:39.422 --> 01:15:40.721
It will make you all better.

01:15:40.723 --> 01:15:41.856
I'm not broken.

01:15:41.858 --> 01:15:44.058
If you don't take your medicine,
you won't get better!

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.828
And if you don't get better,
you'll die.

01:15:53.703 --> 01:15:56.072
Those are the rules.
I didn't make them up.

01:16:00.476 --> 01:16:02.445
No, don't waste any.

01:16:03.479 --> 01:16:06.416
You need to be better
so we can play again!

01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:32.543
What did Edward always say?

01:16:39.483 --> 01:16:40.850
Jason...

01:16:41.418 --> 01:16:42.720
Jason...

01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:48.856
It sounds like another
one of your friends

01:16:48.858 --> 01:16:50.527
is here to play with you.

01:16:52.396 --> 01:16:53.796
Jason?

01:16:54.398 --> 01:16:56.833
Jason, what's wrong?

01:16:57.534 --> 01:16:59.670
Jason, are you okay?

01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:02.971
Don't break! I fixed you!

01:17:02.973 --> 01:17:05.073
Jason, no.

01:17:05.075 --> 01:17:06.608
No!

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:08.977
But I fixed you.
I fixed you!

01:17:11.448 --> 01:17:13.448
Jason?

01:17:30.267 --> 01:17:32.503
Please get better.

01:17:36.473 --> 01:17:37.676
Jason?!

01:17:38.809 --> 01:17:39.877
Jason?!

01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:46.315
I tried to save him.

01:17:46.317 --> 01:17:47.719
I couldn't...

01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:49.953
I'm sorry...

01:18:28.959 --> 01:18:30.928
I'm Detective Peele.

01:18:32.062 --> 01:18:33.463
Do you know where you are?

01:18:35.767 --> 01:18:37.469
A hospital?

01:18:38.803 --> 01:18:40.605
Do you know
how you got here?

01:18:41.673 --> 01:18:42.674
No.

01:18:44.109 --> 01:18:45.610
That's fine.

01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:48.946
Take your time.

01:18:50.482 --> 01:18:52.248
What's the last thing
you remember?

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.884
Um...

01:18:54.619 --> 01:18:57.687
I remember I was in a garage.

01:18:57.689 --> 01:18:59.756
Kate? Is she okay?

01:18:59.758 --> 01:19:01.557
Kate is fine.

01:19:01.559 --> 01:19:03.960
She's a bit shaken up, but fine.

01:19:03.962 --> 01:19:05.597
I want to hear about Roy.

01:19:06.297 --> 01:19:07.799
What do you remember?

01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:11.434
He's dead.

01:19:15.073 --> 01:19:17.306
Do you know who killed him?

01:19:17.308 --> 01:19:21.177
Probably Emilia.
She's psychotic.

01:19:21.179 --> 01:19:22.647
You have evidence for that?

01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:26.683
It's all over that place. There's blood.
I'm sure there's fingerprints.

01:19:26.685 --> 01:19:28.620
None of that point to Emilia.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.856
That's impossible.

01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:34.123
Once we find the body,

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:36.027
maybe we'll know more.

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.696
You haven't found Roy's body?

01:19:39.698 --> 01:19:41.567
We've been
searching the property.

01:19:42.668 --> 01:19:44.135
Let's shift gears.

01:19:45.303 --> 01:19:49.340
How about you explain
in your own words what happened?

01:19:51.342 --> 01:19:54.412
Emilia kidnapped me.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.582
She drugged me.

01:19:57.483 --> 01:19:59.516
She raped me.

01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:00.684
I don't know what Roy
was doing there.

01:20:00.686 --> 01:20:02.151
She must have gotten him, too.

01:20:02.153 --> 01:20:05.823
But you were in touch with them
before they kidnapped you.

01:20:05.825 --> 01:20:10.259
- Yes.
- And you drove to the property yourself?

01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.160
Yes.

01:20:11.162 --> 01:20:12.228
Why?

01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:14.431
I went there to have dinner.

01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:16.999
You went there to have sex.

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:19.503
Yes.
But I didn't want what I got!

01:20:19.505 --> 01:20:21.170
You're unbelievable!

01:20:21.172 --> 01:20:23.307
Kate! Kate!

01:20:23.309 --> 01:20:25.175
Goddamn it. I'm sorry.
Okay?

01:20:25.177 --> 01:20:27.277
I didn't cheat on you,
I promise!

01:20:27.279 --> 01:20:29.746
We found your semen
inside of Emilia.

01:20:29.748 --> 01:20:30.914
How did that happen?

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:33.150
Rape and consensual sex
aren't the same thing!

01:20:33.152 --> 01:20:35.152
No, no, no. You don't get
to get off that easy.

01:20:35.154 --> 01:20:36.820
You cheated on me.

01:20:36.822 --> 01:20:38.255
And now you're trying
to lie to me about it.

01:20:38.257 --> 01:20:41.058
Yes. I was going to. Okay?

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.794
I was scared. I was scared I
wasn't good enough for you.

01:20:43.796 --> 01:20:46.096
Roy tried to warn me.

01:20:46.098 --> 01:20:47.598
And I just didn't listen.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.832
Now he's dead.

01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:50.534
You're alive,
and you're still just

01:20:50.536 --> 01:20:52.069
lying to everybody
like you always do.

01:20:52.071 --> 01:20:53.504
Kate!

01:20:53.506 --> 01:20:55.808
What the fuck is going on?!

01:20:57.209 --> 01:20:58.675
She'll be more willing
to talk to you

01:20:58.677 --> 01:21:01.712
after you help me
get this story straight.

01:21:01.714 --> 01:21:05.084
This is a messy situation.
Help me clean it up.

01:21:06.552 --> 01:21:07.921
Okay.

01:21:10.222 --> 01:21:14.224
When did you decide you no longer
wanted to have sex with Emilia?

01:21:14.226 --> 01:21:18.362
Probably some time
after she drugged me.

01:21:18.364 --> 01:21:19.764
Yes.

01:21:19.766 --> 01:21:22.268
- The drugs.
- Yes!

01:21:24.638 --> 01:21:27.271
The test shows you were on
a lot of drugs.

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:29.741
Sildenafil, cocaine,
uppers, downers.

01:21:29.743 --> 01:21:31.341
They drugged me.

01:21:31.343 --> 01:21:34.111
They drugged me.
My memory...

01:21:34.113 --> 01:21:37.414
...it gets hazy after that.
I just have flashes of...

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:40.217
...Edward feeding me, of...

01:21:40.219 --> 01:21:42.121
...Emilia raping me...

01:21:45.224 --> 01:21:46.693
...of Roy...

01:21:49.361 --> 01:21:50.395
Tell me this.

01:21:50.397 --> 01:21:52.697
Emilia says this was all
part of a game.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.331
Now, why would
she said that?

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.601
Because she's fucked
in the head.

01:21:56.603 --> 01:21:58.036
She also said
that you choked her,

01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.604
you hit her head.

01:21:59.606 --> 01:22:01.506
That never happened.
She's lying.

01:22:01.508 --> 01:22:04.275
There are bruises on her
neck that matches your hand.

01:22:04.277 --> 01:22:06.010
No, there aren't.

01:22:06.012 --> 01:22:09.013
She had an open wound on her head.
She said you did that to her.

01:22:09.015 --> 01:22:10.949
Edward is dead.

01:22:10.951 --> 01:22:13.484
There's a knife with
your fingerprints on it.

01:22:13.486 --> 01:22:15.253
We have you covered
in Roy's blood.

01:22:15.255 --> 01:22:17.722
Your girlfriend testified
that you and Roy were fighting.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.122
I'm trying to make sense
of all this,

01:22:19.124 --> 01:22:22.062
but you're not making it easy.
Help me.

01:22:25.966 --> 01:22:26.698
Lawyer.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.032
Don't do that.

01:22:28.034 --> 01:22:30.568
I'm not saying another fucking
word until I talk to a lawyer.

01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:32.339
I want to work with you.

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:35.007
This story has a lot of holes.

01:22:35.009 --> 01:22:37.375
Come on,
help me fill them in.

01:22:37.377 --> 01:22:38.645
Lawyer.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.482
That's the way
we'll play it, then.

01:22:51.959 --> 01:22:55.060
I wish I believed you, Jason.
I do.

01:22:55.062 --> 01:22:56.862
But you aren't victim here.

01:22:56.864 --> 01:22:59.530
Emilia tried to defend you.

01:22:59.532 --> 01:23:01.066
Tried to make excuses for you.

01:23:01.068 --> 01:23:03.070
Typical victim behavior.

01:23:04.537 --> 01:23:05.740
Why'd you do it?

01:23:07.674 --> 01:23:09.342
You made a mistake.

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.581
I just need to know.

01:23:15.683 --> 01:23:18.518
Off the record.
Help me out.

01:23:23.658 --> 01:23:25.693
The Lord
will be the final judge.

01:23:27.895 --> 01:23:29.830
Go fuck yourself.

01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:51.684
I am so, so sorry

01:23:51.686 --> 01:23:53.387
about what happened to you.

01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:58.359
Thank you.

01:24:07.268 --> 01:24:09.403
What's gonna happen to me?

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:13.941
I don't know.

01:24:15.643 --> 01:24:18.811
But you will never ever

01:24:18.813 --> 01:24:20.981
have to go through
anything like that again.

01:24:24.218 --> 01:24:25.586
I like you.

01:24:27.989 --> 01:24:30.291
I like you, too.

01:24:31.993 --> 01:24:34.261
Do you want to be my friend?

01:24:36.297 --> 01:24:38.265
Okay.

01:24:41.136 --> 01:24:43.402
You should get back inside.

01:24:43.404 --> 01:24:44.805
One more minute.

01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:49.111
I like it out here.
