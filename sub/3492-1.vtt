WEBVTT

00:09.299 --> 00:11.434
Son of a bitch!

00:11.435 --> 00:15.304
Man, this has gotta be the
one. It's kicking my ass.

00:15.305 --> 00:16.528
Twenty minutes till midnight.

00:16.529 --> 00:19.516
Doesn't matter how big this thing is
if we don't get it in before deadline.

00:19.517 --> 00:22.151
No one's gonna notice if
I'm a few minutes over.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.221
I would. You know the rules, Brubaker.

00:25.222 --> 00:28.892
The rodeo ends at midnight. You don't
land it before then, it don't count.

00:28.893 --> 00:32.036
Yeah, well, I'm gonna land it all
right, and then I'm gonna turn around

00:32.037 --> 00:35.292
and change it in for that check with
my name on it back at the Marina.

00:35.293 --> 00:40.562
We are gonna catch the biggest
Amberjack that this town has ever seen.

00:40.563 --> 00:44.240
How do you know it's not a
Grouper or a Marlin, or a tire?

00:44.241 --> 00:47.480
If I want any lip from you,
I'd pull down your panties.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.601
- Ooh! Daddy.
- Yeah.

00:53.822 --> 00:59.722
Hey, honey can you put that damn
camera down and wet my reel here for me?

01:00.342 --> 01:02.826
Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Yeah.

01:02.827 --> 01:05.351
What are we gonna do
with that $30,000, pop?

01:05.352 --> 01:06.533
We're gonna buy a boat.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.007
- Oh, yes.
- No more charters.

01:08.008 --> 01:12.657
I'm tired of Captain Crunch up
there breathing down my neck.

01:12.658 --> 01:14.581
- Look, look, look.
- Oh, daddy.

01:14.582 --> 01:18.123
Getting closer. Get the
gaff, honey. Get the gaff.

01:18.124 --> 01:19.924
Oh!

01:19.989 --> 01:21.362
No, no, no switch!

01:21.363 --> 01:23.977
Come on now. You gotta hold on
to this. It's a fighter. Hold on.

01:23.978 --> 01:25.849
- I got it! Yeah!
- Keep reeling now.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.799
- This ain't no Girl Scout picnic. Come on.
- I know. I know.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.554
Reel it in. It's getting
closer. You got it?

01:31.555 --> 01:33.456
Oh, don't screw this up now.

01:33.457 --> 01:34.738
Come on. Yeah.

01:34.739 --> 01:37.694
- I can see it!
- Yeah!

01:37.695 --> 01:40.125
- I can see it! Argh!
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa!

01:40.126 --> 01:42.286
My fish!

01:42.666 --> 01:45.334
Oh! That fish ate my fish!

01:45.335 --> 01:49.891
You cost me $30,000, you son of a bitch!

01:49.892 --> 01:55.013
Sorry, folks. Guess you'll have to
wait till next year to win one of these.

01:55.014 --> 01:58.238
Just hope your friend
isn't waiting for you too.

01:58.239 --> 02:01.705
Oh, I'll make sure he isn't.

02:01.706 --> 02:04.160
Oh-ho-ho-ho, yeah.

02:04.161 --> 02:06.261
Uh-huh.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.919
Yeah! You eat this, you mother!

02:13.200 --> 02:15.844
No guns on my boat, damn it!

02:15.845 --> 02:17.500
You're done, Brubaker!

02:17.501 --> 02:19.361
Aah!

02:22.691 --> 02:28.451
Don't just stand there. We
got us a Great White to kill.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

02:37.320 --> 02:39.685
- Whoa! Be careful. Be careful.
- Ouch!

02:39.686 --> 02:41.401
- You okay? All right.
- Yes.

02:41.402 --> 02:45.161
Look, I'm gonna give this shark
$30,000 worth of pain now, okay?

02:45.162 --> 02:46.903
- Okay.
- Give me that. You take this.

02:46.904 --> 02:49.471
And go get me my damn hot sauce.

02:49.472 --> 02:51.332
Ugh.

02:57.849 --> 03:00.849
Come on, Sally tuna.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.326
Hot sauce, daddy!

03:05.327 --> 03:07.496
Here you go, you son of a bitch!

03:07.497 --> 03:10.377
I hope that hurts!

03:10.529 --> 03:12.994
You cost me $30,000!

03:12.995 --> 03:16.415
Smile you son of a bitch!

03:17.027 --> 03:19.907
- Yes siree!
- Ah!

03:36.847 --> 03:38.692
Have you lost your damn mind?

03:38.693 --> 03:40.999
This ain't fishing! It's
barbaric! It's criminal!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.320
- I should have both of you arrested!
- That fish ate...

03:43.321 --> 03:49.221
One more word out of you, and
you'll be swimming back to shore!

03:56.634 --> 04:02.534
- You killed him good, pop.
- It was almost worth losing the money.

04:36.682 --> 04:40.762
- You want me to try...
- Shut up!

04:41.845 --> 04:46.798
Ladies and gentlemen, the Great White
Shark, nature's perfect killing machine...

04:46.799 --> 04:49.308
Until me and my daddy...

04:49.309 --> 04:52.009
Whipped his ass!

04:53.179 --> 04:55.339
Victoria!

04:57.695 --> 04:59.495
Oh!

05:00.297 --> 05:03.837
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

05:03.967 --> 05:07.103
Help me! Help me! God! Don't let go!

05:07.104 --> 05:09.624
Help! No! No!

06:25.548 --> 06:28.368
You got six feet.

06:29.086 --> 06:34.966
Almost. Almost. All right. All
right. That's it. That's it.

06:35.126 --> 06:38.786
Would you look at that water!

06:38.799 --> 06:42.181
Hey, dude, you gonna let me
bust the cherry on your jet ski?

06:42.182 --> 06:44.633
Hell, no. Nobody's riding it but me.

06:44.634 --> 06:46.496
Come on, man. I'm not gonna scratch it.

06:46.497 --> 06:48.437
- You'll never get the chance.
- Come on!

06:48.438 --> 06:50.313
Unless you hook me up
with your little sister.

06:50.314 --> 06:52.938
That's not gonna happen dude,
she thinks you're a total jackass.

06:52.939 --> 06:54.275
Then I guess you're out of luck.

06:54.276 --> 06:56.913
I don't think anyone's gonna
be looking at your eyes, Taylor.

06:56.914 --> 07:02.118
Ava, honey, I told you, it's
all about the total package.

07:02.119 --> 07:05.978
You're never gonna get anywhere with
your prude mood or that hideous swimsuit.

07:05.979 --> 07:08.826
Where'd you get that thing
anyway, your grandmother's closet?

07:08.827 --> 07:09.911
What's wrong with it?

07:09.912 --> 07:12.695
Nothing, if you're
trying to stay a virgin.

07:12.696 --> 07:15.531
Blaise, what do you think of Ava's suit?

07:15.532 --> 07:17.606
I think it's really nice.

07:17.607 --> 07:21.904
Don't listen to him, horny
boys will say anything.

07:21.905 --> 07:24.673
What about mine? Maxim material?

07:24.674 --> 07:27.009
Maxim-um jail bait.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.292
Jail bait? What does that mean?

07:29.293 --> 07:31.980
It means he's not interested in
little girls with criminal records.

07:31.981 --> 07:35.296
Ava! Breaking and entering.
We're all so proud.

07:35.297 --> 07:38.120
It's called curiosity. I
wasn't going to steal anything.

07:38.121 --> 07:43.826
Hey, just think. One day, your
curiosity can be tried as an adult.

07:43.827 --> 07:45.728
- Whoops.
- You little...

07:45.729 --> 07:49.098
I'm gonna get you. You better run.

07:49.099 --> 07:52.279
Kid should be arrested.

08:44.321 --> 08:47.321
I got you something.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.045
Aah.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.571
Ladies and gentlemen,
this state-of-the-art hotel

09:25.572 --> 09:30.032
is the first step to bolstering our
economy in our new Smallport initiative.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.641
As Mayor, it is my
personal mission to ensure

09:32.642 --> 09:37.622
that Smallport becomes
the state's number one...

09:38.875 --> 09:40.176
Woo!

09:40.177 --> 09:43.579
This is the greatest
day of my life! Woo!

09:43.580 --> 09:46.550
Come on. Let me get on
the jet ski. Come on.

09:46.551 --> 09:49.952
- They make such a cute couple.
- How come you're not out there?

09:49.953 --> 09:52.330
- I don't swim.
- Don't or can't?

09:52.331 --> 09:56.344
- There's a big difference.
- I don't swim.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.703
- What's your sister's excuse?
- Why?

09:58.704 --> 10:00.762
You have a crush on her, don't you?

10:00.763 --> 10:02.431
So what if I do?

10:02.432 --> 10:05.267
She's only the most boring
person who ever lived.

10:05.268 --> 10:07.048
- Cicely.
- What up?

10:07.049 --> 10:08.737
Check it out.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.306
It's Dad's boat.

10:10.307 --> 10:13.487
Oh, yeah. That's cool.

10:15.977 --> 10:18.027
Did he have a charter today?

10:18.028 --> 10:20.188
Why don't you call him?

10:20.189 --> 10:23.159
- What's wrong?
- She's always tripping.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.960
Can you hand me my phone? Please?

10:24.961 --> 10:27.533
I'm telling you.

10:27.534 --> 10:29.814
Thank you.

10:31.961 --> 10:34.061
You have reached 850-99...

10:34.062 --> 10:36.928
Straight to voice mail.
Where the hell is he?

10:36.929 --> 10:38.647
He's probably just down in the cabin.

10:38.648 --> 10:40.836
No. He never leaves the wheel.

10:40.837 --> 10:43.872
Looks like it's drifting
into that dock a little bit.

10:43.873 --> 10:47.046
Let me up on the jet ski
now. Come on. Let me up there.

10:47.047 --> 10:51.310
- Wanna check it out? I'll race you.
- No, no, just chill okay?

10:51.311 --> 10:54.016
We'll wait till Cameron
gets back from the jet ski.

10:54.017 --> 10:55.937
Lame.

10:56.938 --> 10:59.408
Seriously? I just bought those.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.529
Well, that's too bad.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.827
Yes! This is absolutely awesome!

11:05.828 --> 11:07.688
Aah!

11:07.830 --> 11:10.350
- Woo!
- Yes!

11:11.935 --> 11:13.844
Whoa!

11:13.845 --> 11:16.905
Where are they going?

11:30.018 --> 11:33.281
Just once it would be nice
if you would listen to me.

11:33.282 --> 11:35.224
You just hate that I beat you.

11:35.225 --> 11:37.085
Dad?

11:37.577 --> 11:39.067
Dad!

11:39.068 --> 11:41.408
Oh my God.

11:42.812 --> 11:44.672
Dad?

11:47.003 --> 11:49.505
Is that Dad's?

11:49.506 --> 11:52.386
I don't think so.

11:58.707 --> 12:01.167
But this is.

12:26.343 --> 12:29.463
Cut it out, dumb ass.

12:31.881 --> 12:35.181
Seriously? What the hell?

12:37.554 --> 12:39.988
You son of a bitch! Cameron!

12:39.989 --> 12:43.709
Woo! I'm on a jet ski! Whoa!

12:46.363 --> 12:48.763
Oh, my God!

12:51.134 --> 12:54.136
- Why is Taylor freaking out?
- Maybe she lost her bikini.

12:54.137 --> 12:56.897
I'll rescue her.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.808
Not cool, man! Not cool!

12:59.809 --> 13:02.413
It is what it is!

13:02.414 --> 13:04.334
Yeah!

13:08.552 --> 13:11.432
Oh, my God! Shark!

13:15.148 --> 13:17.526
- Need a lift?
- Shark!

13:17.527 --> 13:20.229
Please. You really think
I was gonna fall for that?

13:20.230 --> 13:22.158
Come on, baby.

13:22.159 --> 13:25.206
- Get us out of here!
- Well, what are you gonna give me?

13:25.207 --> 13:27.007
Oh!

13:27.508 --> 13:32.548
Damn it, Taylor! Nobody
rides that thing but me!

13:43.563 --> 13:46.689
So much for being the only one
that gets to use the jet ski!

13:46.690 --> 13:50.710
- Can I have a shot now?
- Shark!

14:04.479 --> 14:06.279
Ah!

14:06.476 --> 14:09.716
What the hell was that?

14:10.880 --> 14:14.283
Oh, my God! Mick, get
your ass outta there!

14:14.284 --> 14:16.889
Move! Move! Come on! Go!

14:16.890 --> 14:19.588
Come on! Get outta there!

14:19.589 --> 14:22.824
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Mick, get up here.

14:22.825 --> 14:25.461
Ava, get him out. Hurry! Oh, my God.

14:25.462 --> 14:27.387
Catch! Hurry!

14:27.388 --> 14:29.128
Mick!

14:29.129 --> 14:33.029
Oh, my gosh. Hurry. Pull him up.

14:38.854 --> 14:42.244
- Didn't somebody see her?
- Please calm down.

14:42.245 --> 14:44.413
- We're doing everything we can.
- Where's my daughter?

14:44.414 --> 14:46.982
- We're doing all we can.
- Where is she? Is this all...

14:46.983 --> 14:48.717
Something got her in the water.

14:48.718 --> 14:51.287
- We don't know that.
- Oh, my God!

14:51.288 --> 14:54.296
- Oh, my God! Not our little girl!
- Let us do our job.

14:54.297 --> 14:57.837
Please, not our little girl!

14:58.195 --> 14:59.897
- Well, where was Taylor?
- We don't know.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.418
Hey Ava, hey!

15:02.859 --> 15:05.846
Help me out here. You seem like
you got your head on straight.

15:05.847 --> 15:06.735
He doesn't believe us.

15:06.736 --> 15:09.505
I can believe your friend may
have been eaten by a shark.

15:09.506 --> 15:12.775
It's the description of that shark
that I am having a hard time with.

15:12.776 --> 15:14.710
I told you, it was translucent.

15:14.711 --> 15:17.513
"Translucent". The word of the day.

15:17.514 --> 15:20.473
When you say "translucent,"
you mean like a jellyfish?

15:20.474 --> 15:24.152
- Meaning we could see right through it.
- I know what the damn word means.

15:24.153 --> 15:26.702
It was like something
I've never seen before.

15:26.703 --> 15:32.093
I got a missing teenage girl, presumed
dead, and a boat... no occupants.

15:32.094 --> 15:34.631
I was really hoping you
could help me out here.

15:34.632 --> 15:36.923
- Dad's dead too.
- You don't know that for sure.

15:36.924 --> 15:39.892
- No reason to lose hope yet.
- He's dead, Taylor's dead...

15:39.893 --> 15:41.543
There was blood all over the transom.

15:41.544 --> 15:45.638
Aw, hell. I caught a Marlin
once. Bled all over the deck.

15:45.639 --> 15:47.439
Left a mess not unlike your Dad's boat.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.924
Amberjack rodeo was last night.
Maybe reeled in a big one.

15:49.925 --> 15:51.613
But the difference is you're still here.

15:51.614 --> 15:55.814
You think ghosts are logical, Sheriff?

15:59.422 --> 16:01.688
Who said anything about ghosts, Finch?

16:01.689 --> 16:02.825
I did.

16:02.826 --> 16:06.862
You know, that's the trouble
with people like you, Sheriff.

16:06.863 --> 16:11.257
Never wanna deal with the
truth till it's too late.

16:11.258 --> 16:13.267
Ghosts are real.

16:13.268 --> 16:16.727
As real as the lies
this town was built on.

16:16.728 --> 16:19.347
As real as the price we're
gonna pay for those sins.

16:19.348 --> 16:23.117
You mark my words. You mark my words.

16:23.118 --> 16:29.018
Well, maybe if you dried out occasionally,
your words might actually mean something.

16:33.965 --> 16:36.474
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know, Ava.

16:36.475 --> 16:39.694
Look, I'm putting a missing person's
report out on your father, and your friend.

16:39.695 --> 16:42.693
In the meantime, I'm calling
your Aunt Marge to come get you.

16:42.694 --> 16:46.174
We'll be fine on our own.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.412
- Cameron!
- Dad!

16:50.413 --> 16:52.981
- One more time. You were on the jet ski.
- I was on a jet ski...

16:52.982 --> 16:55.265
You okay, son? What happened?

16:55.266 --> 16:58.802
I don't know. Taylor was screaming about
a shark, and the next minute she was gone.

16:58.803 --> 17:01.323
There hasn't been a shark attack
in Smallport in over 20 years.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.965
- Are you sure?
- You should've seen it.

17:02.966 --> 17:04.645
- Good Lord, Cameron.
- It looked like...

17:04.646 --> 17:06.938
A shark scare will put
this town welfare by winter.

17:06.939 --> 17:09.404
- Are you absolutely sure, son?
- Uh...

17:09.405 --> 17:13.137
Hold on. Sheriff! Come here please.

17:13.137 --> 17:16.694
Put a $1,000 bounty on all
sharks in the bay. Keep it quiet.

17:16.694 --> 17:19.415
Last thing we need is a
media-feeding frenzy around here.

17:19.415 --> 17:22.369
Draw up some signs. It should say
"beaches are closed for 24 hours".

17:22.371 --> 17:23.239
Got it.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.550
If I have to do a press
conference about a shark attack.

17:25.551 --> 17:27.567
I'd better be standing
next to a dead one.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.469
- All right, all right.
- You understand?

17:29.470 --> 17:31.866
- Got it.
- Come on, son.

17:31.867 --> 17:32.707
What?

17:32.708 --> 17:35.233
Hiring a bunch of shark bounty
hunters isn't gonna do anything.

17:35.234 --> 17:37.892
Just let us handle this.
Try and get some sleep.

17:37.893 --> 17:39.751
Sheriff can I get with
you for a minute please?

17:39.752 --> 17:41.794
Think about what you actually saw.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.782
We'll pick this up again tomorrow.

17:44.783 --> 17:46.598
Hey.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.536
Let me bring you home.

17:48.537 --> 17:49.716
- No.
- Please?

17:49.717 --> 17:52.666
Really, it's okay. We'll walk.

17:52.667 --> 17:56.267
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

19:29.536 --> 19:34.336
- That's where it cuts off.
- Play it again.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.613
How do I play the damn thing back?

19:37.614 --> 19:39.534
Here.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.573
My daddy whipped his ass!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.730
There.

19:46.742 --> 19:48.990
That's definitely the shark I saw.

19:48.991 --> 19:50.926
One eye, and a hole in it's fin.

19:50.927 --> 19:52.859
That's definitely the
shark that tried to eat me.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.914
So the shark that we saw...
you could see through.

19:54.915 --> 19:56.448
Are we on this again?

19:56.449 --> 19:58.303
Ever heard of an optical illusion?

19:58.304 --> 19:59.938
The shark was dead. They killed it.

19:59.939 --> 20:02.347
Or temporarily dazed.
Or playing possum, maybe.

20:02.348 --> 20:06.205
And you can't explain how a shark killed
three people on the deck of a boat.

20:06.206 --> 20:11.124
In police work, the simplest
explanation is usually the right one.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.768
A couple of yahoos got
a Great White riled up.

20:13.769 --> 20:16.048
Your father paid the price for it.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.587
Let's give it a few more days.

20:17.588 --> 20:20.158
Ava, if nothing turns up

20:20.159 --> 20:24.529
I'll reach out ot the community give your
daddy the kind of service he deserves.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.485
I really appreciate that, Sheriff,

20:26.486 --> 20:30.507
but the shark that killed Taylor and
my Dad was not your average shark.

20:30.508 --> 20:32.412
I understand how upset you are,

20:32.413 --> 20:35.300
but you are really gonna
have to let us do our job.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.885
Maybe he's right, Ava. I mean,
the way that the shark looked,

20:37.886 --> 20:39.971
it could've been a
reflection of the sun.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.607
Is your Dad paying you to say that?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.809
- Sheriff Martin, line 1.
- That's not fair.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.045
- We were pretty far away.
- Martin.

20:46.046 --> 20:49.855
- I know I didn't get a very good look.
- At the Marina?

20:49.856 --> 20:51.984
You check the bars?

20:51.985 --> 20:53.452
Nah, nah. I'll be right down.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.821
Ava, listen to your friends.

20:55.822 --> 20:59.124
You don't wanna wind up like Finch.

20:59.125 --> 21:03.228
- Can we get something to eat?
- Damn it! The pool party!

21:03.229 --> 21:06.577
People are gonna start showing
up to my house any minute now.

21:06.578 --> 21:08.242
Sorry.

21:08.243 --> 21:10.830
I told everybody to invite anybody.

21:10.831 --> 21:13.116
Do you know who's gonna be
showing up to this thing?

21:13.117 --> 21:14.792
Man this is stupid.

21:14.793 --> 21:17.599
The only way this thing is gonna
get canceled is with a SWAT team.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.615
My sister's sorority friends
are driving in from Houston.

21:20.616 --> 21:25.536
- What are you talking about?
- The pool party.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.221
What if we turned it into a memorial?

21:29.222 --> 21:31.142
Yeah.

21:31.578 --> 21:35.898
You're seriously talking about a party?

21:37.538 --> 21:39.498
Let's get out of here.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.659
Come on.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.274
Don't worry about those guys, all
right? They're just being jerks.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.343
Look, what do you wanna do right now?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.233
Go home.

21:53.234 --> 21:55.180
I don't think y'all should be alone.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.984
Why don't you let me take you and
Cicely, and we'll go do something?

21:57.985 --> 22:00.219
- We'll get something to eat.
- Please.

22:00.220 --> 22:04.240
I know you mean well, but no way.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.776
Will you at least just
promise me that you'll

22:09.777 --> 22:11.715
text me or call me if you need anything?

22:11.716 --> 22:14.836
Anything. I'm serious.

22:17.871 --> 22:20.931
I'll call you later.

22:44.726 --> 22:45.965
Finch.

22:45.966 --> 22:48.371
That guy really creeps
me out. He's a freak.

22:48.372 --> 22:49.781
- Shh!
- What are you doing?

22:49.782 --> 22:51.436
- Mr. Finch.
- Ava!

22:51.437 --> 22:54.143
- Do you got a moment to talk?
- What do you want?

22:54.144 --> 22:56.303
Sheriff send you out here
to spy on me or something?

22:56.304 --> 22:58.844
No. Why would he wanna do that?

22:58.845 --> 23:00.462
I didn't see nothing.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.285
But you're the lighthouse keeper, right?

23:02.286 --> 23:03.693
What's that supposed to mean?

23:03.694 --> 23:06.811
You think everything that happens
off the coast is my responsibility?

23:06.812 --> 23:10.116
Of course not. But yesterday,
you were talking like...

23:10.117 --> 23:13.897
You knew something about ghosts.

23:20.757 --> 23:23.397
Leave me alone!

23:24.571 --> 23:28.239
I told you that guy was creepy.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.720
He's also hiding something.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.700
Hand me those beers.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.036
- Hey, Chad.
- Oh, what's up, Catherine, baby?

23:57.037 --> 23:59.471
Give me some sugar.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.741
This is gonna be awesome!

24:01.742 --> 24:06.079
That thing had to be at least 30 feet
long, and it swallowed Taylor whole.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.304
Oh, my God. You must've been
so scared. What did you do?

24:09.305 --> 24:12.365
Well, I had my diving knife, and
I started stabbing that thing!

24:12.366 --> 24:15.548
Gash, gash, gash! Went all
Michael Myers on that bitch.

24:15.549 --> 24:17.830
But then it was too late to save Taylor.

24:17.831 --> 24:21.911
- You're so brave.
- Salut, ladies.

24:28.419 --> 24:30.302
Hey, ass clown!

24:30.303 --> 24:32.704
I didn't think you were
gonna make it here tonight.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.885
Come here. Talk to me.

24:51.336 --> 24:53.676
Belly bomb!

24:57.194 --> 24:58.918
What the hell are you doing, man?

24:58.919 --> 25:00.698
Worried about your phone getting wet?

25:00.699 --> 25:03.027
- Get off of me!
- Don't have the warranty?

25:03.028 --> 25:05.671
Yo man, get off! Get off!

25:05.672 --> 25:07.535
You need to cool down, man.

25:07.536 --> 25:10.379
- What are you doing?
- Have some fun here.

25:10.380 --> 25:15.240
Emily. This is gonna
help cheer you up, okay?

25:15.266 --> 25:17.966
Feast your eyes.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.273
Enjoy yourself!

25:40.272 --> 25:42.225
Son of a bitch!

25:42.226 --> 25:46.066
Man, this has gotta be the one.

26:00.344 --> 26:01.742
Will you get that?

26:01.743 --> 26:04.923
You get it! I'm busy.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.637
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.806
I tried calling you... before.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.735
Oh. I was...

26:16.736 --> 26:19.796
- Hey, Blaise.
- Hey.

26:21.248 --> 26:25.374
You were right about the party.
It was stupid I... I shouldn't...

26:25.375 --> 26:26.830
I um...

26:26.831 --> 26:29.250
It was a dumb idea to
try to have fun right now.

26:29.251 --> 26:31.621
This is not the right time for that.

26:31.622 --> 26:32.724
I'm sorry.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.861
Well, I'm glad you came.
I wanna show you something.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.801
- Daddy whipped his ass!
- How did you get this?

26:38.802 --> 26:41.218
I stole it from the Sheriff's
computer while he was talking.

26:41.219 --> 26:42.665
Victoria!

26:42.666 --> 26:44.466
Ow!

26:45.214 --> 26:47.679
Pretty ballsy.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.409
- Take my hand!
- Doesn't bother you to be watching this?

26:50.410 --> 26:54.910
There. That's not a solid figure, is it?

26:55.315 --> 26:57.316
You're seeing this, aren't you?

26:57.317 --> 26:58.750
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

26:58.751 --> 27:03.191
But I'm not the one you gotta convince.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.688
Yeah!

27:26.246 --> 27:28.623
Those two ass-clowns...
we're ass-clowns?

27:28.624 --> 27:33.004
You're a ass clown. He's a ass clown.

27:36.479 --> 27:40.559
Man, get that crap on out of here!

27:43.213 --> 27:46.776
Don't do it over here and be
messing up my party like that, man!

27:46.777 --> 27:48.995
- What?
- Get that crap outta my house!

27:48.996 --> 27:53.316
Now I'm doing a gainer in your house.

28:20.979 --> 28:25.419
Oh, my God! Did you guys just see that?

28:28.550 --> 28:31.724
Mick! I'm coming, bro!

28:31.725 --> 28:33.406
You gotta get me outta here!

28:33.407 --> 28:35.108
Come on! Look! I'm right here!

28:35.109 --> 28:36.616
Come on, buddy! Mick, I got you!

28:36.617 --> 28:38.607
- Come on, come on!
- I can't! Can you pull me up?

28:38.608 --> 28:40.323
- You pull yourself!
- I can't!

28:40.324 --> 28:42.097
Yes, you can! Don't tell me you can't!

28:42.098 --> 28:44.984
I got you, but you
gotta help! Mick! Mick!

28:44.985 --> 28:47.520
Mick, please! Mick!

28:47.521 --> 28:50.161
Mick, no! Mick!

29:13.952 --> 29:15.109
Hello?

29:15.110 --> 29:16.987
- Ava, Mick's dead.
- Who is it?

29:16.988 --> 29:20.163
We were all having fun at the party,
and all of a sudden Mick was in the pool,

29:20.164 --> 29:22.887
and he was reaching for me I'm
trying to get him out, but he's gone.

29:22.888 --> 29:26.668
Look, get over here quick. Bye.

29:27.525 --> 29:29.445
What?

29:30.298 --> 29:32.698
What is it?

30:01.665 --> 30:03.363
I don't know what happened here,

30:03.364 --> 30:06.354
but the stories you and the
others are saying makes no sense.

30:06.355 --> 30:09.299
You gotta start telling
me the truth right now.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.234
What type of drugs was y'all on?

30:11.235 --> 30:13.236
Bath salts? P.C.P.?

30:13.237 --> 30:15.906
Did y'all take a bad trip and
start gnawing on each other?

30:15.907 --> 30:18.241
You gotta tell me. That's the
only way I can protect you.

30:18.242 --> 30:19.162
It was the shark, Dad.

30:19.163 --> 30:21.540
- That one from the beach.
- Stop saying it was the shark.

30:21.541 --> 30:24.123
- It's the truth! Why won't you believe me?
- It's not that I don't believe you.

30:24.124 --> 30:25.966
But if you keep spouting
off with that nonsense,

30:25.967 --> 30:27.786
not even I can stop them from
putting you in the loony bin.

30:27.787 --> 30:29.577
Really, you worried about
me or the next election?

30:29.578 --> 30:30.385
What?

30:30.386 --> 30:31.928
You worried about me
or the next election?

30:31.929 --> 30:33.211
Look, don't put this back on me.

30:33.212 --> 30:35.492
We got a bunch of mutilated
bodies in our yard,

30:35.493 --> 30:38.616
and the authorities want
answers now son, now!

30:38.617 --> 30:40.542
You wait right there, don't you move.

30:40.543 --> 30:42.256
Sheriff...

30:42.257 --> 30:44.134
Don't you move.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.519
You got a second?

30:46.520 --> 30:48.538
Excuse me.

30:48.539 --> 30:50.759
Sheriff...

30:51.041 --> 30:53.643
Bring Cameron down, put
him in an isolated cell.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.012
Till he starts talking,
sober up, or both.

30:56.013 --> 30:58.648
It's for his own safety.
But do it quietly.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.798
Last thing I need around
here is rumors going around

31:00.799 --> 31:02.952
saying that he's responsible
for this hell of a mess.

31:02.953 --> 31:04.477
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

31:04.478 --> 31:07.288
Cameron, Cameron, what happened?

31:07.289 --> 31:09.526
It got Mick's man.

31:09.527 --> 31:12.162
It got him and tore him to pieces.

31:12.163 --> 31:13.929
Where did it come from?

31:13.930 --> 31:16.603
Cameron, why don't you
take a ride with me?

31:16.604 --> 31:18.769
- What for?
- He just wanna take a ride with you, son.

31:18.770 --> 31:20.469
Just want to ask you some questions.

31:20.470 --> 31:21.671
I didn't do anything.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.340
We know you didn't. Maybe you
can help us figure out who did.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.952
Why don't you ask the other
witnesses who were here what they saw?

31:26.953 --> 31:29.323
I don't have time to listen
to this nonsense anymore, Ava.

31:29.324 --> 31:31.238
It's not nonsense! It's fact!

31:31.239 --> 31:34.143
A fact that's gonna swim up and bite
you in the ass if you don't wake up!

31:34.144 --> 31:37.120
Shut up! We appreciate your concern.

31:37.121 --> 31:40.557
With that being said, you better get
outta my sight before I have you locked up.

31:40.558 --> 31:42.292
You hear me, missy? I didn't stutter.

31:42.293 --> 31:44.740
- But you don't...
- Shut up! Stay outta my way, and stay...

31:44.741 --> 31:46.199
- Dad...
- Shut up, son!

31:46.200 --> 31:49.196
Stay away from Cameron,
and stay outta my way!

31:49.197 --> 31:52.357
Let's go. Get outta my way!

31:52.358 --> 31:55.058
Sheriff! Sheriff!

32:00.644 --> 32:04.230
- You're gonna wanna see this.
- Oh, God.

32:04.231 --> 32:09.297
I, uh, found this little
number over in the bushes there.

32:09.298 --> 32:11.053
And...

32:11.054 --> 32:14.324
Here's something you're not
gonna see on Discovery Channel.

32:14.325 --> 32:16.809
My house! Now I'm doing
a gainer in your house.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.163
What is... mmm.

32:19.164 --> 32:21.100
- That can't be real.
- Oh, it's real.

32:21.101 --> 32:23.621
Are you sure?

32:23.731 --> 32:25.164
Goodness gracious!

32:25.165 --> 32:27.552
I don't know how that guy
got elected. He's a total ass.

32:27.553 --> 32:29.742
- Tell me about it.
- You all right?

32:29.743 --> 32:32.683
I'm fine. And you?

32:38.149 --> 32:41.749
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:41.862 --> 32:43.760
- Go! Go!
- Yes, this is happening now.

32:43.761 --> 32:47.481
- Hurry up.
- Cameron! Cameron!

32:47.791 --> 32:52.591
I'm gonna beat you like
you stole something!

33:36.607 --> 33:39.307
Don't spray me.

33:52.895 --> 33:55.055
Stop it!

33:56.594 --> 33:59.894
Do you want a car wash?

34:21.418 --> 34:23.697
Hey, sexy.

34:30.127 --> 34:32.047
Geez.

34:32.295 --> 34:34.456
Come on.

34:34.851 --> 34:37.071
Aw, hell.

34:49.079 --> 34:51.239
My turn.

34:59.581 --> 35:01.861
Mom, help!

35:20.042 --> 35:21.902
Woo!

35:58.048 --> 36:01.085
This is only the latest in a
string of mysterious killings

36:01.086 --> 36:04.328
that have terrorized Smallport
over the last 48 hours.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.787
Thirteen people are reported dead.

36:06.788 --> 36:09.629
Meanwhile, there are
swarms of rumors about

36:09.630 --> 36:12.995
an unidentified animal that may
have attacked in these cases.

36:12.996 --> 36:16.101
Police say they are trying
to find three crucial victims

36:16.102 --> 36:18.603
who could be vital in
solving this case...

36:18.604 --> 36:23.359
Ava Reid, Blaise Parker, and Cameron
Stahl, who's the son of Mayor Frank Stahl.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.658
Were witnesses to the fatal shark attack

36:25.659 --> 36:28.244
in an area ironically
nicknamed Dead Man's Point.

36:28.245 --> 36:33.825
Which began this bizarre
cycle of violence two days ago.

37:08.594 --> 37:11.174
No trespassing!

37:14.523 --> 37:16.683
Damn it.

37:34.384 --> 37:36.364
Hello!

37:36.613 --> 37:38.221
Can't you read?

37:38.222 --> 37:41.051
This area's off-limits!

37:41.052 --> 37:43.512
You in here?

37:46.222 --> 37:48.057
Hey!

37:48.058 --> 37:52.618
You come out now, I won't call the cops!

38:05.375 --> 38:07.835
Judas priest.

38:16.889 --> 38:19.371
What is this dude
possibly gonna do for us?

38:19.372 --> 38:21.204
We need proof that we're not nuts.

38:21.205 --> 38:23.352
So we go see the nuttiest guy in town?

38:23.353 --> 38:25.920
Might as well strap me
to the electric chair now.

38:25.921 --> 38:27.296
You didn't have to come.

38:27.297 --> 38:30.232
I'm starting to wish I didn't.

38:30.233 --> 38:32.668
Why do y'all wanna
go to that lighthouse?

38:32.669 --> 38:34.770
There's probably snakes
and stuff out here.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.906
Ava, wait up.

38:36.907 --> 38:39.876
- You guys really think this is cool?
- Just keep an eye out.

38:39.877 --> 38:42.409
- What? For what?
- For snakes, man.

38:42.410 --> 38:44.778
Look at my shoes.

38:44.779 --> 38:47.599
- Ugh!
- Come on.

38:47.851 --> 38:50.279
- Ava. Ava, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- For what?

38:50.280 --> 38:53.322
He's not home. We should bounce.
This is breaking and entering.

38:53.323 --> 38:55.253
It's just entering.
The door's already open.

38:55.254 --> 38:57.280
Dude, that's a felony,
and I don't do felonies.

38:57.281 --> 38:59.051
It's a misdemeanor, baby.

38:59.052 --> 39:01.692
- Grow a pair.
- Yeah.

39:01.693 --> 39:04.453
You grow a pair.

39:04.651 --> 39:06.631
Hello!

39:06.912 --> 39:08.013
Hello!

39:08.014 --> 39:11.194
Yo, Ave, check it out.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.603
It's a basement.

39:18.604 --> 39:20.824
Oh, hell.

39:21.172 --> 39:23.326
What are we coming
down here to accomplish?

39:23.327 --> 39:28.727
Be careful before the stone
breaks this place is old.

39:28.846 --> 39:31.648
- You complain too much, man.
- What's the whole point?

39:31.649 --> 39:35.189
What's your friggin' reason?

39:35.820 --> 39:37.980
Come on.

39:39.390 --> 39:41.910
Ava, come on.

39:42.157 --> 39:46.297
- Man, just shut up.
- You shut up.

39:50.241 --> 39:53.730
This is one creepy ass dude.

39:53.731 --> 39:59.191
I think this guy might have
more problems than we do.

40:00.878 --> 40:04.418
- Whoa!
- Don't touch that!

40:05.452 --> 40:07.217
Mr. Finch!

40:07.218 --> 40:09.151
I'm sorry but your door was open.

40:09.152 --> 40:11.621
It's still breaking and entering.

40:11.622 --> 40:14.862
- Hey.
- Watch it, man.

40:25.803 --> 40:28.137
You're here about the shark, aren't you?

40:28.138 --> 40:30.940
So you do know what's
going on, don't you?

40:30.941 --> 40:33.877
- Maybe.
- Well, good.

40:33.878 --> 40:35.604
Maybe you can help us stop it.

40:35.605 --> 40:37.424
Stop it?

40:37.425 --> 40:41.654
The cave brings things back
it don't take them away.

40:41.655 --> 40:43.865
- Cave?
- Yes! The cave!

40:43.866 --> 40:46.746
Damn it! The cave!

40:57.501 --> 41:00.441
It's all connected.

41:00.561 --> 41:02.458
They wanna keep it a secret.

41:02.459 --> 41:04.841
But I know.

41:04.842 --> 41:07.062
Allison...

41:07.849 --> 41:10.309
Is that you?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.199
Mr. Finch?

41:13.200 --> 41:16.620
Why'd he call you Alison?

41:16.855 --> 41:20.275
- All right. Help me lift him.
- Come on.

41:20.276 --> 41:26.176
- What are we gonna do with this guy?
- Let's get him onto the bed.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.768
Let's get him a little further up.

41:31.769 --> 41:34.263
Hold on. There.

41:34.264 --> 41:36.184
Okay.

41:41.142 --> 41:44.502
Dude, that was productive.

41:49.753 --> 41:51.698
Hey, this is Ava. Leave a message.

41:51.699 --> 41:54.491
Where the hell are
you? The cops were here.

41:54.492 --> 41:56.593
They say you're interfering
with their investigation.

41:56.594 --> 41:59.028
They practically water-boarded me.

41:59.029 --> 42:04.929
Just call me or text me or something
before I have a total freak-out, okay?

42:57.222 --> 42:59.029
Cicely?

42:59.030 --> 43:01.610
Cicely? Cicely!

43:02.996 --> 43:05.636
Oh, no. Cicely!

43:14.708 --> 43:16.342
Come here! Come here! Come here!

43:16.343 --> 43:18.310
- Are you okay?
- Come on! Come on!

43:18.311 --> 43:20.679
- Ow. Ow! Ow!
- What happened?

43:20.680 --> 43:23.450
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!

43:23.451 --> 43:26.350
- What is it? What happened?
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

43:26.351 --> 43:28.187
It's so deep. Cameron, get in here!

43:28.188 --> 43:29.500
- What happened?
- Ow!

43:29.501 --> 43:31.190
- Get something to wrap it!
- This!

43:31.191 --> 43:35.031
Grab that! Put that on her leg!

43:46.789 --> 43:49.725
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- Calm down, ladies and gentlemen.

43:49.726 --> 43:51.368
- Calm down.
- What is going on?

43:51.369 --> 43:54.789
Okay, Sheriff Martin and Mayor
Stahl will be confirming...

43:54.790 --> 43:57.477
- No sign of Cameron yet.
- Y'all should've found him by now.

43:57.478 --> 43:59.450
Paging Sheriff Martin.

43:59.451 --> 44:02.110
Finding your son is the least
of my concerns right now.

44:02.111 --> 44:04.852
We're getting more 911 calls
than the dispatcher can handle,

44:04.853 --> 44:08.473
not that I have the deputies
respond to them all anyway.

44:08.474 --> 44:10.879
Maybe it's time we let people
know what we saw on that video.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.458
What, and incite a mass panic?

44:12.459 --> 44:17.066
Frank, a car was hot-waxed with the
entrails of the woman washing it.

44:17.067 --> 44:20.766
I'd say the town's already panicked.

44:20.767 --> 44:22.944
Henry, prepare a press release for me.

44:22.945 --> 44:25.867
It should read, "Public
safety is my primary concern".

44:25.868 --> 44:28.273
Everything that can
be done is being done".

44:28.274 --> 44:31.525
Release the video. No comment
speculating on what we think it is.

44:31.526 --> 44:33.377
- Let them see it for themselves.
- Yes, Sir.

44:33.378 --> 44:35.104
And get Ava Reid on the phone.

44:35.105 --> 44:36.958
Tell her to bring
Cameron here right now,

44:36.959 --> 44:38.796
or this is gonna be the
worst day of her life.

44:38.797 --> 44:40.704
- Sheriff Martin, line one.
- The worst.

44:40.705 --> 44:43.012
- Today can get worse?
- Yes.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.413
Hello. Martin here.

44:44.414 --> 44:46.874
Hello? Hello?

44:48.339 --> 44:50.519
- She needs help.
- Oh ah, no!

44:50.520 --> 44:52.703
She needs to see a paramedic!

44:52.704 --> 44:54.991
- I'm fine.
- You see? She's fine.

44:54.992 --> 44:56.509
- No, she's not.
- Ow.

44:56.510 --> 45:00.463
- Don't be a baby.
- Seriously, it looks way worse than it is.

45:00.464 --> 45:06.044
Oh, yeah? Well get up and
let's see you try and walk.

45:16.246 --> 45:18.847
See? I'm fine.

45:18.848 --> 45:20.649
Hey, look at this.

45:20.650 --> 45:25.150
It's a news article from nine years ago.

45:25.725 --> 45:29.175
Finch might not be as
crazy as we thought he was.

45:29.176 --> 45:32.128
So that's Alison. That's Finch's wife.

45:32.129 --> 45:37.351
It says she drowned in a cave near the
lighthouse when the high tide came in.

45:37.352 --> 45:39.352
I remember that.

45:39.353 --> 45:42.613
Lot of people thought
that he killed her.

45:42.614 --> 45:44.573
So that must be the cave
that he's talking about.

45:44.574 --> 45:46.543
Guess so.

45:46.544 --> 45:49.073
Where did we find my Dads boat?

45:49.074 --> 45:52.096
And where did that thing first show up?

45:52.097 --> 45:54.214
Practically on Finch's doorstep.

45:54.215 --> 45:57.677
We saw Finch yesterday
leaving the Maritime Museum.

45:57.678 --> 46:00.466
They have all kinds of stuff
about that lighthouse there.

46:00.467 --> 46:02.513
Stuff that's not online.

46:02.514 --> 46:04.870
- It's better than nothing.
- I got it!

46:04.871 --> 46:07.329
- What?
- It appears in water.

46:07.330 --> 46:09.498
Any water, right?

46:09.499 --> 46:13.882
So maybe it can't manifest itself
unless there's water around.

46:13.883 --> 46:19.609
Maybe all we gotta do is stay
dry and it'll leave us alone.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.490
Oh, no. Please no.

46:27.084 --> 46:30.018
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

46:30.019 --> 46:31.601
Wait up.

46:31.602 --> 46:33.601
Wait up. I'm coming with you.

46:33.602 --> 46:36.543
No. No, no, no. I need you to stay here.

46:36.544 --> 46:37.820
Seriously?

46:37.821 --> 46:39.454
Just do this for us. Please.

46:39.455 --> 46:41.564
Come on.

46:41.565 --> 46:42.980
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

46:42.981 --> 46:47.069
All right, good, good. Wait till we're
gone and then answer the door, okay?

46:47.070 --> 46:50.190
And we were not here.

46:51.853 --> 46:54.853
Sheriff's Department.

46:56.213 --> 46:58.931
Sheriff's Department. Open up.

46:58.932 --> 47:01.650
Come on. Nice and easy.

47:01.651 --> 47:03.107
Ugh.

47:03.108 --> 47:05.808
Go. Go. Go. Go.

47:07.557 --> 47:09.837
Let's go.

47:09.871 --> 47:12.571
Go, go. Go. Go.

47:24.674 --> 47:27.434
Stop the vehicle.

47:27.529 --> 47:30.529
Turn off the engine.

47:30.947 --> 47:32.425
Back so soon?

47:32.426 --> 47:34.150
Told you they're not here.

47:34.151 --> 47:37.285
You're welcome to take another look
around if you want. Door's unlocked.

47:37.286 --> 47:39.121
Aren't you a little young to be driving?

47:39.122 --> 47:42.639
Not according to the D.M.V.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.640
You wait right here.

48:19.696 --> 48:21.497
It's all connected.

48:21.498 --> 48:23.753
It's all connected. It's the cave.

48:23.754 --> 48:27.534
It's the cave. It's the cave!

48:28.059 --> 48:29.536
It brings things back.

48:29.537 --> 48:33.197
You have to help us stop it.

48:35.262 --> 48:37.362
My God.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.863
They're going after it.

48:43.296 --> 48:45.335
I say we make a run for it.

48:45.336 --> 48:47.733
I got the keys to my Dad's
cabin in Ridgeway right here.

48:47.734 --> 48:49.191
You guys ever been to Ridgeway?

48:49.192 --> 48:52.496
Running away isn't gonna do anything
except get more people killed.

48:52.497 --> 48:53.718
We have to destroy it.

48:53.719 --> 48:59.619
How no one's going to listen to us?
We're running out of options here.

49:02.472 --> 49:04.473
What the hell was that?

49:04.474 --> 49:06.275
Building demolitions.

49:06.276 --> 49:09.278
Part of my Dad's new
Smallport initiative.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.281
Oh, yeah? How's that going?

49:12.282 --> 49:14.622
Just drive.

49:34.059 --> 49:35.085
Thought you quit.

49:35.086 --> 49:39.646
I did. You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

49:58.762 --> 50:02.962
I'm gonna look over here, all right?

50:12.909 --> 50:16.149
Ava. Come look at this.

50:26.267 --> 50:29.725
Wow. Listen to this.
Look at what it says here.

50:29.726 --> 50:34.296
"Built in 1897 after hundreds of
ships crashed in it's shallow reef".

50:34.297 --> 50:37.984
Huh. I guess that's why they
call it Dead Man's Point.

50:37.985 --> 50:40.326
You guessed wrong.

50:40.327 --> 50:44.440
Hi. Do you know anything about
the cave by the lighthouse?

50:44.441 --> 50:46.519
Ah, you think what's going
on in town has something

50:46.520 --> 50:49.123
to do with the old
legends and ghost stories?

50:49.124 --> 50:50.772
More or less.

50:50.773 --> 50:53.816
Have either of you heard of the
legend of the lost Roanoke colony?

50:53.817 --> 50:56.810
Yeah, those colonists in the Carolinas.

50:56.811 --> 51:00.512
Who all just vanished without a
trace a couple hundred years ago.

51:00.513 --> 51:02.324
Very good.

51:02.325 --> 51:06.285
What if I told you that a
similar thing happened right here?

51:06.286 --> 51:09.534
I would ask you why I
never heard of it before.

51:09.535 --> 51:15.248
Because the town elders did
their best to keep it a secret.

51:15.249 --> 51:21.149
Before 1803, Smallport was the
Spanish province of Ensenada Cabo.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.492
Now...

51:24.854 --> 51:27.314
This diary...

51:27.419 --> 51:30.515
Happens to be the most
detailed documentation,

51:30.516 --> 51:33.161
of the history in this area at the time.

51:33.162 --> 51:35.162
And just like Roanoke...

51:35.163 --> 51:37.605
The entire population vanished.

51:37.606 --> 51:40.186
Into thin air.

51:41.398 --> 51:44.167
Maria, who wrote this...

51:44.168 --> 51:47.302
Was convinced that spiritual
forces were responsible.

51:47.303 --> 51:49.992
Wait. What do you mean "spiritual"?

51:49.993 --> 51:52.191
Supernatural.

51:52.192 --> 51:53.622
Ghosts.

51:53.623 --> 51:55.213
Do you believe it?

51:55.214 --> 51:58.046
No. No, it was more likely
a plague of some kind.

51:58.047 --> 52:01.983
And Maria herself was most likely
infected by the disease too.

52:01.984 --> 52:07.289
I'm betting that the stories in here
were just fevered hallucinations.

52:07.290 --> 52:10.327
So where does the cave come in?

52:10.328 --> 52:15.148
Ah, Maria's journal begins after
some of the infected were rounded up,

52:15.149 --> 52:17.633
brought to the cave, and executed.

52:17.634 --> 52:21.366
Maria writes that
soon after the murders,

52:21.367 --> 52:25.498
the angry dead Rose up
and ravaged the town.

52:25.499 --> 52:30.384
The journal cuts off in the
middle of the last entry.

52:30.385 --> 52:35.965
"Anyone who dies in the cave
violently will rise again".

52:38.028 --> 52:39.921
Careful.

52:39.922 --> 52:43.592
What I'm about to show you is
the companion piece to the Memoir.

52:43.593 --> 52:47.844
A Grimoire, which is a book of
spells that gives very detailed

52:47.845 --> 52:53.305
instructions on how to send
vengeful spirits into hell.

52:59.353 --> 53:01.693
It's gone.

53:01.778 --> 53:03.239
What was supposed to be here?

53:03.240 --> 53:06.780
The Grimoire, the book that
was in this display case.

53:06.781 --> 53:08.775
He was acting even
stranger than usual but I

53:08.776 --> 53:10.661
never thought he would
do something like this.

53:10.662 --> 53:13.538
- Who was it?
- The lighthouse keeper. Darnell Finch.

53:13.539 --> 53:15.624
He was the only other
person who was in here today.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.605
Finch.

53:56.474 --> 53:58.934
The exhibits.

54:08.459 --> 54:09.464
The floor.

54:09.465 --> 54:12.233
Help me with this tarp.

54:12.234 --> 54:13.549
What happened?

54:13.550 --> 54:15.884
Hey, Cameron.

54:15.885 --> 54:17.943
- What did you do, man?
- I didn't do anything!

54:17.944 --> 54:19.655
It wasn't my fault!

54:19.656 --> 54:21.768
Knock it off!

54:21.769 --> 54:24.331
- I should punch you in the face right now.
- Leave it. Leave it.

54:24.332 --> 54:27.512
Then do it, tough guy.

54:30.283 --> 54:33.343
You guys, behind you!

54:37.506 --> 54:39.720
Whoa. Aah!

54:39.721 --> 54:43.921
- Not the lighthouse.
- Don't do it!

54:59.863 --> 55:02.323
Cameron, run!

55:02.465 --> 55:05.645
Come on, man! Come on!

55:12.031 --> 55:14.191
Come on!

55:14.911 --> 55:17.091
Cam! Cam, get up!

55:17.092 --> 55:19.413
- Come on!
- Get up!

55:19.414 --> 55:21.246
Oh, my God. He's coming, man!

55:21.247 --> 55:23.107
Aah!

55:24.003 --> 55:26.823
- Cam!
- Come on!

55:30.417 --> 55:33.580
The city's in a mass panic. That's
fine. I totally understand all that.

55:33.581 --> 55:36.109
But election is coming up.

55:36.110 --> 55:37.715
Okay, Sheriff?

55:37.716 --> 55:40.275
If I loose my job,
you loose your job too.

55:40.276 --> 55:45.256
- That's what you're worried about?
- Yes. Yes.

56:21.771 --> 56:23.751
Henry?

56:26.054 --> 56:27.898
Aah!

56:27.899 --> 56:29.744
Aah!

56:29.745 --> 56:31.605
Aah!

56:51.070 --> 56:52.498
911. What's your emergency?

56:52.499 --> 56:55.195
Hi. Um, we have two people dead
here at the Maritime Museum.

56:55.196 --> 56:56.900
- The Maritime Museum?
- Yes.

56:56.901 --> 56:59.035
Stay put. We're sending an
officer to your location.

56:59.036 --> 57:03.656
Tell them to turn off the
sprinklers before they go in.

57:03.657 --> 57:07.317
You've got to be kidding me.

57:08.788 --> 57:10.667
What are you doing? You can't drive.

57:10.668 --> 57:12.599
I can drive. I just
don't have my license yet.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.523
You need to go home.

57:14.524 --> 57:15.727
Where's Cameron?

57:15.728 --> 57:17.129
It's none of your business.

57:17.130 --> 57:19.654
Now just please... just
get your ass back home.

57:19.655 --> 57:21.122
Why? It's not any safer there?

57:21.123 --> 57:23.000
It's a lot safer there
than where we're going.

57:23.001 --> 57:25.403
Let me help.

57:25.404 --> 57:30.804
You can help me by laying
low and staying dry, okay?

57:32.347 --> 57:33.684
Will you take her home, please?

57:33.685 --> 57:36.304
Yeah. Where you going?

57:36.305 --> 57:40.751
We're about to ride into a hell storm,
and I don't want her riding shotgun.

57:40.752 --> 57:44.052
What happened to Cameron?

57:48.926 --> 57:50.274
Meet me at the lighthouse, okay?

57:50.275 --> 57:51.825
Are you sure it's a good idea?

57:51.826 --> 57:56.109
No, but Finch has the book, and I
think it's time for an intervention.

57:56.110 --> 57:58.030
Okay.

58:03.584 --> 58:05.327
Oh, dear God.

58:05.328 --> 58:07.848
Are you sure?

58:07.919 --> 58:09.719
No.

58:09.726 --> 58:12.846
Right. I'll tell him.

58:18.317 --> 58:20.498
Cameron Stahl. Leave a message.

58:20.499 --> 58:22.479
Frank?

58:24.904 --> 58:27.192
- We found Cameron.
- Well, it's about damn time.

58:27.193 --> 58:30.823
No, Frank. We've got two people
dead at the Maritime Museum.

58:30.824 --> 58:32.712
Cameron's one of 'em.

58:32.713 --> 58:35.053
I'm sorry.

58:38.318 --> 58:40.386
Is that charter boat
still down at the docks?

58:40.387 --> 58:43.489
Ray's boat? Yeah, I think so. Why?

58:43.490 --> 58:46.674
Get your gear. We're going fishing.

58:46.675 --> 58:47.860
Frank!

58:47.861 --> 58:52.665
Arlene, try and hold off
Armageddon till I get back.

58:52.666 --> 58:54.635
Officer, we're not getting any answers.

58:54.636 --> 58:56.369
The Mayor's not talking to anybody...

58:56.370 --> 58:57.636
- The Mayor!
- Frank!

58:57.637 --> 58:59.974
Frank, hold on a
second. Hold on a second!

58:59.975 --> 59:03.162
Frank! You are not thinking straight.

59:03.163 --> 59:06.549
No, I get it now. It's the curse.

59:06.550 --> 59:09.515
I'm gonna hunt that son of a
bitch down on it's own turf.

59:09.516 --> 59:11.624
- Me and you, Sheriff.
- This is crazy.

59:11.625 --> 59:13.591
You'll get your revenge,
Frank, but right now...

59:13.592 --> 59:18.052
Revenge? You think I'm
worried about revenge?

59:18.053 --> 59:21.026
I don't want revenge.

59:21.027 --> 59:23.667
I want justice.

59:34.842 --> 59:36.822
Finch!

59:37.811 --> 59:40.271
Finch! Finch!

59:40.906 --> 59:42.798
I know you have it!

59:42.799 --> 59:45.559
We need to talk!

01:00:19.052 --> 01:00:22.154
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

01:00:22.155 --> 01:00:24.323
Guess the Fire Department
didn't get the memo.

01:00:24.324 --> 01:00:27.804
Hey! Get out of the water!

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.294
Move!

01:00:32.265 --> 01:00:34.054
They don't look very nice.

01:00:34.055 --> 01:00:37.196
I got this. Kids listen to me.
You're in a lot of danger, all right?

01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.820
- You gotta get out of the water now.
- What's your problem, punk?

01:00:39.821 --> 01:00:43.079
I'm trying to help you, all
right? There's a shark and...

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.613
I know it sounds crazy,
all right? You gotta go!

01:00:45.614 --> 01:00:48.129
I want some of what y'all smoking.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:51.149
Listen to me, kid, you gotta get
your friends and you gotta leave, now!

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.210
Y'all need to leave.

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:05.622
Okay.

01:01:13.928 --> 01:01:15.788
Ugh.

01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:22.059
You all right?

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:26.928
Come here. Come here. Come on.

01:01:29.422 --> 01:01:34.582
- We got a little problem.
- We got a bigger one.

01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:01.579
Come on.

01:02:10.515 --> 01:02:13.080
I wanna see this damn thing for myself.

01:02:13.081 --> 01:02:16.635
Me too. But I don't know what
we're expecting to find out here.

01:02:16.636 --> 01:02:19.931
Well, it started here, so
we're gonna finish it here.

01:02:19.932 --> 01:02:21.936
What if it doesn't show?

01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:24.757
Just keep looking.

01:02:43.412 --> 01:02:45.572
Damn it.

01:02:55.519 --> 01:03:00.316
I knew you'd come. You
got a real stubborn streak.

01:03:00.317 --> 01:03:01.488
You found it.

01:03:01.489 --> 01:03:05.629
Mm, the solid portion of him anyway.

01:03:08.888 --> 01:03:10.485
Hey, that's the book from the museum.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.901
Hey! What's it to you?

01:03:11.902 --> 01:03:14.640
I need it. To stop the shark.

01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:16.867
Well, why do you think I stole it?

01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:18.469
I wasn't sure.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:23.302
To find a way to kill the
shark without hurting Alison.

01:03:23.303 --> 01:03:25.354
Your wife's dead.

01:03:25.355 --> 01:03:27.335
Wrong.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.712
Well, then where is she?

01:03:32.713 --> 01:03:34.210
Why is she here?

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:36.371
Shut up.

01:03:38.177 --> 01:03:39.977
No.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:56.622
That means, uh...

01:03:56.623 --> 01:04:02.245
That means, "a spirit can be sent back
to the netherworld by using a talisman".

01:04:02.246 --> 01:04:06.386
Made from the object that killed it.

01:04:11.266 --> 01:04:13.126
Hmm!

01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:18.123
So we have to use this?

01:04:18.124 --> 01:04:22.204
Better hope that was the kill shot.

01:04:30.669 --> 01:04:32.186
Nuh-uh.

01:04:32.187 --> 01:04:35.524
Your daddy brought this
horror into our world.

01:04:35.525 --> 01:04:38.885
You get to send it back.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.797
Seen anything yet?

01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:48.353
He knows we're coming.

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:49.554
Huh?

01:04:49.555 --> 01:04:52.086
I said he's scared. He
knows we got his number.

01:04:52.087 --> 01:04:53.314
The number of the beast.

01:04:53.315 --> 01:04:56.795
- Frank, that doesn't even make sense.
- Shut up and start chumming.

01:04:56.796 --> 01:04:59.992
I knew I shouldn't have come out here
with you. You've lost your damn mind!

01:04:59.993 --> 01:05:01.226
I said start chumming.

01:05:01.227 --> 01:05:04.702
We don't need to chum, we are the chum.

01:05:04.703 --> 01:05:07.601
All we need is a will to live
and that thing is coming after us.

01:05:07.602 --> 01:05:12.144
That's the point. In order to kill
it, you gotta be willing to die.

01:05:12.145 --> 01:05:13.195
It's over, Frank.

01:05:13.196 --> 01:05:16.748
I'm turning this boat around right now.

01:05:16.749 --> 01:05:18.850
You wanna run that by me again?

01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:24.011
Get back to chumming
before I blow off your head.

01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:59.291
Gary!

01:06:56.649 --> 01:06:58.509
Aah!

01:07:14.033 --> 01:07:15.705
Hey, pee-wee!

01:07:15.706 --> 01:07:17.876
Maybe you ought to call it.

01:07:17.877 --> 01:07:20.171
What, like hey fishy, fishy?

01:07:20.172 --> 01:07:22.512
Oh, please.

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:24.672
Just give me the damn thing.

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:28.453
Like this, here check this out.

01:07:32.785 --> 01:07:35.051
Whoa. Easy, psycho.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.252
Why did you bring her here?

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.447
We didn't have a choice, all right,
what the hell are you doing in the water?

01:07:38.448 --> 01:07:40.197
We know how to kill it.

01:07:40.198 --> 01:07:42.026
How?

01:07:42.027 --> 01:07:43.465
With this, buddy.

01:07:43.466 --> 01:07:45.863
You're going to stab a ghost to death?

01:07:45.864 --> 01:07:49.038
Yeah. Something like that.

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:51.436
Whoa! There it is! There it is.

01:07:51.437 --> 01:07:52.814
Get out there.

01:07:52.815 --> 01:07:55.037
Ava! Ava, get out of the water!

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:56.908
No, no, you stray
right there, sweetheart.

01:07:56.909 --> 01:07:59.397
- What are you doing?
- You're doing just fine.

01:07:59.398 --> 01:08:01.258
Ava!

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:05.970
Ava! What are you...
get out of the water!

01:08:25.465 --> 01:08:27.957
- Whoa!
- It worked!

01:08:27.957 --> 01:08:30.058
Amazing!

01:08:44.089 --> 01:08:45.948
Aah!

01:08:55.778 --> 01:08:57.313
You all right?

01:08:57.314 --> 01:08:59.821
Come on, sis. How do you feel?

01:08:59.822 --> 01:09:02.791
So it's not as easy as I thought.
Must have missed something.

01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:04.441
Maybe we're looking
at this the wrong way.

01:09:04.442 --> 01:09:05.999
- What do you mean?
- The settlers.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.140
The ones that died in the 18th century.

01:09:08.142 --> 01:09:10.292
All of that bad energy
is still in the cave.

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.143
Maybe it's the cave we need to blow up.

01:09:12.144 --> 01:09:14.285
That's gonna take some
serious ammunition.

01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:16.303
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:09:16.304 --> 01:09:19.424
Don't talk like that.

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:23.417
We passed a construction
site on the way over here.

01:09:23.417 --> 01:09:25.488
They were blasting. They have dynamite.

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:29.330
No! Nobody's blowing up nothing!

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.897
Forget that.

01:09:32.581 --> 01:09:35.100
Look, Finch...

01:09:35.795 --> 01:09:40.526
I'm really sorry about your wife,
but she's been dead for a long time.

01:09:40.527 --> 01:09:42.981
We need to save the people in
this town that are still alive.

01:09:42.982 --> 01:09:44.524
She's still alive, damn it.

01:09:44.524 --> 01:09:46.069
In this world.

01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:47.662
Hey! Give me that.

01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:49.212
Hey.

01:09:49.212 --> 01:09:51.983
- Stay where you are.
- I can't lose her again!

01:09:51.984 --> 01:09:57.363
Don't you understand that!
I won't do it! I can't do it!

01:09:57.364 --> 01:10:00.034
It wasn't your fault. She drowned.

01:10:00.035 --> 01:10:02.555
I killed her!

01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:06.351
I killed her. I killed her.

01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:11.145
She was always looking
for a little treasure.

01:10:11.146 --> 01:10:13.653
She thought they were treasures.

01:10:13.654 --> 01:10:16.523
Whenever there was a high tide,
the trinkets and the objects

01:10:16.524 --> 01:10:20.075
from the sunken ships would show up.

01:10:20.076 --> 01:10:23.616
Drift into that little cave.

01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.325
Like those.

01:10:29.973 --> 01:10:32.669
We gonna be out here all day?
Come on. I'm sick of this...

01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:35.587
I loved my wife, but
we fought all the time.

01:10:35.588 --> 01:10:38.377
Especially if we were both drinking.

01:10:38.378 --> 01:10:42.150
Things could get ugly
between the two of us.

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:48.051
And Alison, she would tend to
get violent when I made her mad.

01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:57.285
I lost control.

01:10:57.286 --> 01:11:03.106
By the time I realized what
I was doing, it was too late.

01:11:04.807 --> 01:11:08.435
I ran back to the lighthouse.

01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:13.577
Told the Sheriff Alison was in the
cave when the high tide rolled in.

01:11:13.578 --> 01:11:17.963
They ruled it a drowning, but
they always suspected I'd done it.

01:11:17.964 --> 01:11:22.644
Worse, I had to live
knowing I'd done it.

01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:28.907
Only solace I've had is
knowing she must have forgiven.

01:11:28.998 --> 01:11:33.545
She must have known she
wasn't in my right mind.

01:11:33.546 --> 01:11:37.415
Or else she could have come
back for revenge like...

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:40.696
Like those settlers, like that shark.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:43.745
You're worried about Alison's
spirit if we blow up the cave?

01:11:43.746 --> 01:11:47.081
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

01:11:47.082 --> 01:11:48.670
Check it out.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.011
Look. Look.

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:55.157
I'm not gonna lose her again.

01:11:55.158 --> 01:11:59.160
Look, Finch, I understand your pain.

01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:04.141
I do. But I'm not gonna let innocent people
die just to soothe your guilty conscience.

01:12:04.142 --> 01:12:09.788
So you can help me or not, but I'm
gonna do this with or without you.

01:12:09.789 --> 01:12:14.075
I cannot let you do that.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:12:14.076 --> 01:12:15.577
Give me that book!

01:12:15.578 --> 01:12:19.995
- You're making a mistake.
- Give me that book, kid.

01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:21.950
There's gotta be another way.

01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:23.904
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna find it.

01:12:23.905 --> 01:12:26.365
We can help.

01:12:33.656 --> 01:12:35.516
Hey!

01:12:43.049 --> 01:12:45.389
Step aside.

01:13:08.664 --> 01:13:10.468
Where'd you learn how to pick a lock?

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.569
Youtube.

01:13:13.362 --> 01:13:15.942
Almost got it.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.820
Voila.

01:13:33.656 --> 01:13:34.949
- You want me to drive?
- No.

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:38.010
- Can I drive?
- No.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.540
Hello?

01:13:56.841 --> 01:13:58.941
Sheriff?

01:14:01.382 --> 01:14:04.142
Anybody on board?

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:18.698
Son of a bitch.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.220
Yuck.

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:26.706
- This is it.
- It's locked.

01:14:26.707 --> 01:14:29.338
I mean, we could probably jump
it, but that's barbed wire.

01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:30.420
Can you get us in?

01:14:30.421 --> 01:14:33.080
No way. That trick
doesn't work on padlocks.

01:14:33.081 --> 01:14:35.602
Then we have to ram it.

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:39.741
Destruction of property, theft
of highly-explosive material.

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:42.682
Breaking, entering...

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:45.026
Tell that to the Judge
if he's still alive.

01:14:45.027 --> 01:14:47.247
Punch it.

01:14:58.006 --> 01:15:00.166
My turn.

01:15:07.315 --> 01:15:08.937
Get in.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:11.218
All right.

01:15:12.952 --> 01:15:15.532
That was cool.

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:54.701
Let's see.

01:16:28.364 --> 01:16:30.584
The cave.

01:16:41.615 --> 01:16:46.175
- Watch out for snakes, all right?
- Okay.

01:16:54.156 --> 01:16:56.316
Come on.

01:17:08.775 --> 01:17:10.923
We have to do this.

01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:12.406
I know you do.

01:17:12.407 --> 01:17:15.887
And I'm here to help you.

01:17:16.505 --> 01:17:19.505
Let's get 'er done!

01:17:20.127 --> 01:17:21.544
Go.

01:17:21.545 --> 01:17:23.765
Last one.

01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:37.271
Okay. All good.

01:17:42.538 --> 01:17:44.458
Okay.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.849
- Okay.
- Is one fuse enough?

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:51.750
Yeah, it'll chain-reaction. This
whole place is toast. Lighter?

01:18:09.568 --> 01:18:10.411
Stay here!

01:18:10.412 --> 01:18:13.412
Where are you going?

01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:23.883
God forgive me.

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:46.263
- Look, just hurry up!
- The lighter's wet.

01:18:48.643 --> 01:18:50.683
Blaise!

01:18:51.447 --> 01:18:53.861
- I'm okay.
- Get the hell out of here!

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:56.622
In front of you!

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.820
Hey! Hey!

01:19:11.467 --> 01:19:13.507
Blaise!

01:19:14.538 --> 01:19:16.758
Oh, damn.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:33.139
Bit me, you bitch.

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:13.990
Hey!

01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:23.974
Ava.

01:21:23.975 --> 01:21:26.735
It's gonna blow!

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.074
No! Ava!

01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:24.290
Ah!

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.017
No! No!

01:22:38.805 --> 01:22:40.605
No.

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:44.636
She's gonna die.

01:22:44.775 --> 01:22:47.175
She's dead.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.333
She's gone.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.619
Hey!

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.480
Hey!

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.197
Oh, my God.

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:17.598
Oh, my God.

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:28.361
Hey, you all right? What
happened to your hand?

01:23:28.362 --> 01:23:31.002
It'll be okay.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.477
Hey, what happened to "I don't swim"?

01:23:33.478 --> 01:23:35.846
I said, "I don't swim,"
not "I can't swim".

01:23:35.847 --> 01:23:38.727
Who's winning now?

01:23:39.335 --> 01:23:44.795
Sucks about Mick and, uh,
Taylor, and your Dad, and...

01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:47.213
Oh, Cameron.

01:23:48.543 --> 01:23:50.725
What day is it today?

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:52.826
Tuesday?
