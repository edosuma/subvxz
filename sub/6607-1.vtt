Uh-huh.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.603
We get 100 little shits like you,

00:38.605 --> 00:41.606
transferred from youth
corrections every year.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.742
Now, you got two problems.

00:43.744 --> 00:48.447
One, you done all your time so far
with kids, instead of real cons.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.683
So you think you tougher
than you actually are.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.052
Two, the guards of the Y.O.S.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.088
still think they can put
Humpty back together again.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.691
Which makes you soft.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.928
It means you used to getting
away with shit.

01:02.930 --> 01:07.065
Here, you throw an elbow
at another inmate,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.633
we got a problem.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.702
You understand that?

01:15.609 --> 01:17.642
Aw, man.

01:17.644 --> 01:21.179
This is gonna be fun.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.088
Hell of a way to make a first
impression on your committee, yo.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.960
Pick a fight before
you even step off the bus.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.128
Burns.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.805
Let's go.
Shoulder against the wall.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.218
Fuck!

02:17.703 --> 02:20.238
What, are you nervous?

02:20.240 --> 02:23.041
These kids have been going to
school together forever.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.246
What if they don't like me?

02:28.248 --> 02:30.949
I know better than you, boy.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.251
They know nothing about you.

02:33.253 --> 02:36.021
You're gonna be great.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.090
There's Larr.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.127
We're here to discuss
the enrolment of James Burns

02:42.129 --> 02:45.030
into the freshman class
of Roosevelt High School,

02:45.032 --> 02:48.133
per the request of
his mother, Tracy Burns.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.735
Miss Burns,
let me be frank with you.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.871
We have some concerns.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.839
Okay.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.174
We're listening.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.912
We've read your son's record, and
we're not convinced that our school

03:00.914 --> 03:04.215
is the right place for a student
with his particular history.

03:04.217 --> 03:07.285
There are other institutions
that might be more...

03:07.287 --> 03:09.187
Wait.
Beneficial.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.189
Are you saying
you're-you're not gonna take him?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.059
Obviously we're... This
is a public school.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.627
Is this...

03:15.629 --> 03:17.295
Experiences of abuse
that your son endured,

03:17.297 --> 03:22.167
but the fact is
that James has a record

03:22.169 --> 03:25.870
of unstable,
even violent behaviour.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.205
He could be a danger
to the other children.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.373
Mm-hmm.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.176
You spent 20 minutes
with this file,

03:31.178 --> 03:32.811
suddenly you're
an expert on my son?

03:32.813 --> 03:33.979
You're the James expert.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.313
Excuse me.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.048
Feel free at any time
to step in and do your job.

03:37.050 --> 03:41.786
At 14, James already
has convictions for robbery,

03:41.788 --> 03:43.355
vandalism, and assault.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.725
He's been institutionalized
three times in eight years,

03:46.727 --> 03:49.394
once for threatening your
boyfriend with a knife.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.030
Jesus, he was ten years old.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.999
The fact is...

03:59.171 --> 04:00.672
All the required equivalency tests.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.174
Yes, he has.
He wants to enrol here,

04:03.176 --> 04:04.943
and his counsellor has
declared him fit to do so.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.311
And he will.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.680
And we'll be back.
Come on, let's go.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.728

I've heard bullshit like that
woman said my whole life.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.403
This is a setback, that's all.

05:05.405 --> 05:09.474
No one said it was gonna be easy.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.143
Whatever.

05:12.145 --> 05:16.181
You've been doing real good
these past three months,

05:16.183 --> 05:17.716
but you gotta be patient.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.851
You gotta...
you gotta stay home,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.219
you gotta stay outta trouble,

05:21.221 --> 05:25.757
you gotta let the
lawyer do his job.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.792
Yeah.

05:32.431 --> 05:36.901
No one's gonna drive you to
school today if you miss the bus.

06:16.308 --> 06:18.243
Holly, did you finish the milk?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.411
No.

06:24.850 --> 06:26.885

Um, hi.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.503
Hi.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.105
How are you?
I'm good, how are you.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.973
Yo, dude, your toilet's flooded.

06:54.346 --> 06:55.847
Go, go, go, go.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.183
Run, hurry!
What the hell?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.119
Goddamn kid, I'll teach you lesson.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.488
Come on.

07:03.490 --> 07:07.392
Come on, come on!

07:07.394 --> 07:10.995

07:16.870 --> 07:18.903
That was crazy!

07:20.206 --> 07:22.373
I'm Crystal.

07:23.275 --> 07:26.344
I'm James.

07:26.346 --> 07:30.949
You wanna get high?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.318
I just bought these
high tops this year.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.320
150 fuckin' dollars.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.322
You know what the problem is?

07:37.324 --> 07:39.924
They're made by some kids in China.

07:39.926 --> 07:44.229
Probably doesn't even know what
a pair of sneakers looks like.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.597
What are you talking about?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.131
Yo, I gotta get out of here.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.132
Why?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.534
If I'm not home by eight,

07:49.536 --> 07:51.436
a box pops up my PO's computer
and I'm fucked.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.438
Oh shit.
What did you do?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.074
I brought home a gun.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.611
My mom found it in my sock drawer and
freaked, so I got 15 months in juvie.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.248
Wait, are you serious?
Your mom called the cops.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.349
Yeah.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.351
Your mom.
Yeah.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.055
Damn.
I gotta go.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.924
Oh, no, don't be like that.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.058
Come on.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.361
Come on, I'm just playing with you.

08:16.363 --> 08:20.198
I'm sure Mommy loves you very much.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.199
Shit.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.167
The kids looks about...

08:23.169 --> 08:24.602
Nine?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.638
Probably doesn't have
a care in the world.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.073
I'm 14.
And fuck you.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.075
I got cares.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.145
So that thing only works at night?

08:35.148 --> 08:37.148
I guess so.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.452
So what are you doing tomorrow?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.061
Okay.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.984
Try it now.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.222
Ha-ha.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.963
What's up?

09:24.965 --> 09:25.663
New fish.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.231
I give him two weeks.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.700
Mm-mm, bullshit.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.235
Three days commissary says
Jongo's gonna turn him out

09:31.237 --> 09:33.237
quicker'n nothin'.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.474
Oh, shit look at what we got here.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.977
What's up, fresh meat?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.979
She looks like a little puta to me.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.313
I don't want trouble.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.248
S'all right, Opie.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.550
You'll be safe with us.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.086
We got your back.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.988
Leave it alone, JB.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.658
Guillermo already got beef with you over
that beat down you gave his boy at intake.

10:02.001 --> 10:06.204
Yo, Guillermo,
why you such a bitch?

10:06.206 --> 10:09.574
Holy shit,
it's fuckin' Dennis the Menace.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.309
You got something
to say, white boy?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.311
Huh?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.114
Wanna make this about us, or what?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.415
Nah.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.218
I'm just wondering why
a bigger mano like you

10:20.220 --> 10:22.553
only has the heart
to fuck with the punks.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.526
Fuck you.

10:43.742 --> 10:46.110
You disrespectful little bitch.

10:47.746 --> 10:50.148
You just bought that one.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.154
Everybody get the fuck down!

10:57.624 --> 10:59.057
Fuck you!

10:59.059 --> 11:01.092
Get down.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.502
Get up, Burns.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.237
You been here, what?
Three weeks?

11:13.239 --> 11:16.707
And how many fights is that, convict?
'Cause honestly I've lost count.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.776
You know, at first
I thought, I dunno,

11:18.778 --> 11:20.778
maybe you're trying
to prove yourself.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.182
Show the natives they shouldn't
mess with you and your baby face.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.319
But now I think, maybe you're
just a guy that likes fighting.

11:28.321 --> 11:32.223
Just trying to protect...
And who the fuck are you?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.125
Chris Cesario.

11:34.127 --> 11:34.792
I'm new.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.294
No shit!

11:36.296 --> 11:38.796
You think this asshole
is protecting you?

11:38.798 --> 11:41.199
You think he's your friend?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.534
Are you this fish's friend, inmate?

11:43.536 --> 11:45.403
No.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.239
Are you trying to protect
him from getting his shit reamed

11:48.241 --> 11:50.475
by this wetback
or anybody else in my yard?

11:50.477 --> 11:52.143
No.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.545
Why don't you tell him, inmate?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.681
I don't give a fuck about you.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.749
You must not care
about the ratification committee.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.685
You couldn't possibly.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.121
'Cause you like it here.
I like it here.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.257
The difference is, I like it
here because this is my yard.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.162
You like it here 'cause it's an
opportunity for you to suck dick!

12:11.364 --> 12:12.697
Once a loser...

12:14.399 --> 12:16.434
always a loser.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.872
Thought you said
your mom wasn't home.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.242
Okay, then, why are you afraid?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.245
Look, Mary,
I thought you were cool.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.783
Okay!

12:32.785 --> 12:36.187
Nice place, Mary.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.522
Oh.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.624

You were very cute.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.526

12:41.528 --> 12:44.162
Just like a...

Do you get high?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.903
I have an idea.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.806

16:32.959 --> 16:34.759
I know you don't mean that.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.026
Oh yeah?

16:36.028 --> 16:38.829

31:21.747 --> 31:23.913
What?

31:27.285 --> 31:29.452
You can sleep here if you want to.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.730
Hold.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.899
Open 42.

32:04.922 --> 32:07.090
Watch out!

32:43.862 --> 32:45.895
Hey, old timer.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.565
You got anything to read?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.800
Come on, I've been in the
hole for three weeks.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.838
I'm going batshit.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.574
I don't wanna be friends, guppy.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.009
I've been down more than three
years, I ain't no fish.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.084
JB...

33:08.086 --> 33:09.552
Guillermo runnin' his mouth, man.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.756
Punk ass said you snuck him
in the shower.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.924
Wants to put a knife in your back.

33:21.098 --> 33:22.098
So what?

33:22.100 --> 33:24.467
So we should handle that.

33:28.672 --> 33:30.407
Why does nobody test that guy?

33:31.876 --> 33:33.877
'Cause that guy made it known
he didn't wanna be tested.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.780
Motherfucker's got
status in the yard.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.916
Killed five people inside and
saying he's done two more since.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.492
Hold!

33:58.869 --> 34:01.137
Planning a vacation?

34:01.139 --> 34:03.540
Don't talk to me.

34:07.478 --> 34:09.145
Why I'm right?

34:09.147 --> 34:11.447
'Cause poetic seizures keep me
thinking in Morse code,

34:11.449 --> 34:14.617
so I write all the Tory
hallucinations in sign language,

34:14.619 --> 34:16.485
so you can see how it sounds
when I write, all right?

34:16.487 --> 34:19.155
I write keys and escape plans
but chain gangs,

34:19.157 --> 34:21.123
street gangs turn into literary
genius, am I right?

34:21.126 --> 34:24.460
I rewrite, everybody start,
everyone have to write...

34:25.831 --> 34:27.996
Yard's over!

34:39.510 --> 34:41.945
Yo.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.112
What's in Rio de "Janeerio"?

34:46.684 --> 34:48.717
Shut up.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.928
Hit.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.097
Hit.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.210
Somethin' better.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.613
Somethin' better?

35:42.541 --> 35:44.707
It's pronounced "Janeiro".

35:48.712 --> 35:51.147
You've been?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.316
Only in my mind.

35:59.557 --> 36:02.859
I got this kid hurt.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.562
There was a fight in the
showers and he got stabbed.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.663
So?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.831
So, I'm gonna
do something about it.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.907
Oh, starting
a yard war is a good way

36:17.909 --> 36:20.743
to make sure you don't
go back to the real world.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.848
Maybe that's what you're scared of.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.850
I'm not scared.

36:30.287 --> 36:33.856
Oh, you think you different
than these other assholes?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.258
News for you, kid.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.627
You're not.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.647
Go!

37:30.649 --> 37:32.949
Oh, shit!

37:37.122 --> 37:38.655
Hey.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.357
Um, can I get two grape cigarillos

37:41.359 --> 37:43.760
and a pack of racks, please?

37:43.762 --> 37:46.362
Do you have ID?

37:46.364 --> 37:48.765
Oh... I think I forgot it at home.

37:50.868 --> 37:53.202
Come on, we're friends aren't we?

38:08.218 --> 38:10.053
Just take it.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.387
What?

38:11.389 --> 38:13.189
I don't want any trouble.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.024
I've seen you around.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.059
I know you deal drugs.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.060
I'm not robbing you.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.228
I'm paying, see?

38:21.265 --> 38:23.132
I'm James.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.467
Hey.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.469
Come here.

38:29.406 --> 38:31.441
Let's go somewhere and fuck.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.279
<i>♪ Uh-huh</i>

38:36.281 --> 38:39.982
<i>♪ It's a fly little low so</i>

38:39.984 --> 38:41.818
<i>♪ I thought you got that outfit
last week week ♪</i>

38:41.820 --> 38:43.986
<i>♪ When you were shoppin'
Call it heavy ♪</i>

38:47.291 --> 38:49.092
<i>♪ Fly while you catch up
on the latest ♪</i>

38:49.094 --> 38:51.260
Hey yo, slow down.

38:53.997 --> 38:56.899
Yo!

38:56.901 --> 38:58.901
Are you deaf?

38:58.903 --> 39:01.437
Hey, yo, slow down.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.806
What, here?

39:05.242 --> 39:07.110
Yo, pull the fuck over!

39:07.112 --> 39:09.278
Pull over!

39:11.348 --> 39:15.017
What the hell is wrong with you? You
know with the shit we got in the trunk?

39:15.019 --> 39:18.254
If a cop pulled us over
we would get ten years.

39:18.256 --> 39:21.524
Roc sends you on a couple errand boy jobs
and suddenly you're fucking invincible?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.292
No.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.762
Then what?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.130
What?

39:27.132 --> 39:29.298
I've invincible all along.

39:33.203 --> 39:34.337
Ugh!

39:34.339 --> 39:36.072
Plus, with the amount of paper

39:36.074 --> 39:37.874
I've been puttin' in Roc's pocket,

39:37.876 --> 39:41.444
he's gonna start
taking me more seriously.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.813
I ain't nobody's bitch, Crystal.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.551
Grimey, fuck this.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.486
Jamesy Boy here, talkin' me
into bringing him back

39:50.488 --> 39:53.790
to their own crib,
to plan their next move.

39:53.792 --> 39:58.261
But once, now look, once he's inside...
Wha'd you do, man?

39:58.263 --> 40:00.263
I robbed them.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.431
Oh, shit.

40:02.433 --> 40:03.833
Naw, right?

40:03.835 --> 40:06.002
Swear to God,
no jokes little brother,

40:06.004 --> 40:08.004
picks up one of their
own pieces, right?

40:08.006 --> 40:09.005
A'ight.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.239
Mm-hmm, yeah.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.176
Stands one guy, against four.

40:13.178 --> 40:17.246
Eenie, meenie, miney,
motherfuckin' Moe.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.581
Shit.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.118
Tells him he's collecting
a "disloyalty tax".

40:22.120 --> 40:23.853
Disloyalty tax.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.121
Hold up.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.923
What the fuck happened after that?

40:26.925 --> 40:29.325
They shit their pants,
is what happened!

40:29.327 --> 40:31.294
They paid him!

40:31.296 --> 40:33.296
They pissed all over their rug.

40:33.298 --> 40:34.897
And I end up making money

40:34.899 --> 40:38.234
on what's supposed to be
a strike against me.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.403
Right?

40:42.539 --> 40:46.175
But that shit ain't even the point.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.845
Naw.

40:48.847 --> 40:51.981
The point is,
Jamesy Boy's got loyalty.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.987
It was good.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.957
I want to talk to you about
some ideas I got.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.426
Maybe a couple deals I think
I could line up on my own.

41:05.996 --> 41:08.331
All right.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.399
Drink one of these.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.568
Put some fuckin' bass
in your voice.

41:21.946 --> 41:23.946
Not now.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.448
Right?

41:25.450 --> 41:26.616
You keep putting in that work

41:26.618 --> 41:29.418
on the smaller jobs, we'll see.

41:31.321 --> 41:32.355
All good?

41:32.357 --> 41:34.090
Cool.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.493
All right.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.397
By the way,
congratulations on Crystal.

41:42.366 --> 41:44.600
Thank God for the sluts, right?

42:05.189 --> 42:06.956
Hon, look what I found.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.624
What is this,
like a diary or some shit?

42:08.626 --> 42:11.127
You writing down your feelings?

42:11.129 --> 42:13.062
What are you doing?

42:13.064 --> 42:14.563
Can you imagine if Roc
or Drew found this?

42:14.565 --> 42:15.965
Give it back!
Oh my God.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.133
I said give it back to me!

42:17.135 --> 42:20.002
Oh! Calm down.
Hey.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.305
I just didn't know
my big tough gangster

42:22.307 --> 42:24.473
had a soft and chewy centre.

42:27.644 --> 42:29.679
What?

42:31.281 --> 42:32.315
Hey!

42:32.317 --> 42:34.116
Hey.

42:34.118 --> 42:35.618
Come here.

42:35.620 --> 42:38.354
I'm sorry, okay?

42:38.356 --> 42:42.258
I promise we'll never
talk about your diary again.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.460
All right?

43:11.121 --> 43:13.322
How was your drive?

43:13.324 --> 43:15.491
Long.

43:17.027 --> 43:20.262
There was construction,
the weather's shit, of course.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.733
How's Holly?

43:23.735 --> 43:25.101
Better.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.502
She says hi.

43:26.504 --> 43:32.375
She looks like she might actually...
make good.

43:32.377 --> 43:34.310
I guess I probably
helped with that.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.145
"Now you best behave yourself
or you'll end up

43:36.147 --> 43:40.016
You haven't ended up
like anything yet.

43:43.186 --> 43:44.620
God, I hate...

43:44.622 --> 43:46.789
I hate this place.

43:47.691 --> 43:50.726
I could've been here too.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.496
No, you wouldn't have.

43:53.498 --> 43:55.664
Thanks.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.469
What do you want for Christmas?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.737
What?

44:01.739 --> 44:03.205
Your hearing's in five weeks,

44:03.207 --> 44:04.807
it's your first
Christmas in four years,

44:04.809 --> 44:06.776
you can bet there's gonna be
something under the tree.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.611
When was the last time
you got a tree?

44:08.613 --> 44:10.279
I'm getting you a kickass present,

44:10.281 --> 44:15.584
so unless you want socks,
you better say something.

44:18.388 --> 44:20.556
Just a hearing, Mom.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.668
We've both got dealt
shitty hands, boy,

44:32.670 --> 44:35.337
but things are gonna get better?

44:38.442 --> 44:40.609
Yeah.

46:47.371 --> 46:49.371
Yo.

47:14.731 --> 47:16.899
Well?

47:18.401 --> 47:20.269
Is it honest?

47:20.271 --> 47:21.937
Yeah.

47:21.939 --> 47:24.306
Why the hell do you
care what I think?

47:35.852 --> 47:38.020
You really kill five people?

48:03.847 --> 48:08.317
There's a giant bay...

48:08.319 --> 48:13.289
and in the middle there's a rock...

48:13.291 --> 48:16.592
and way up high on the mountain...

48:16.594 --> 48:20.529
there's a 100-foot tall
statue of Jesus Christ...

48:21.998 --> 48:24.366
with his arms spread out.

48:28.038 --> 48:31.073
They speak Spanish there, right?

48:32.409 --> 48:34.910
Naw.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.013
No, Portuguese.

48:38.015 --> 48:40.482
It's the only country
in South America

48:40.484 --> 48:42.351
where they don't speak Spanish.

48:42.353 --> 48:45.621
And they eat those, um...

48:45.623 --> 48:47.423
those little bananas, right?

48:47.425 --> 48:50.359
Plantains.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.927
Hmm.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.730
Now you keep writing.

48:54.732 --> 48:57.099
It don't matter about what,

48:57.101 --> 49:01.036
it don't even matter
if it's good or not.

49:01.038 --> 49:04.373
You do everything you can
to just block this shit out.

49:06.576 --> 49:08.577
Just block it out.

49:18.889 --> 49:21.924
Prisons are packed
with crowded spaces.

49:21.926 --> 49:26.395
Lifers and guards,
with hollow faces.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.071
Amongst the sea...

49:36.073 --> 49:38.574
But amongst the sea
of tribulation...

49:41.579 --> 49:45.614

Cesario, get up man.

51:03.661 --> 51:07.563
You gotta show them you're
strong, get the fuck up, man.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.565
All right.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.771
What's up with you?

51:15.773 --> 51:17.773
What's up, ha.

51:23.012 --> 51:25.180
Read that.

51:39.095 --> 51:42.931
I had a girl on the outside too.

51:42.933 --> 51:46.201
I was crazy for her.

51:46.203 --> 51:48.871
But after I went down,
she stopped talking.

51:48.873 --> 51:51.106
It's tough.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.941
But it's not the end of the world.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.210
I guess so, ha.

51:55.212 --> 51:58.680
Stephanie was like the whole
reason I kept going.

51:58.682 --> 52:00.716
Two fucking years.

52:03.219 --> 52:06.021
So, you know, um,
when I was in the med ward,

52:06.023 --> 52:10.592
there were these visitors that
would come in and read to us.

52:10.594 --> 52:12.828
One of them told me something.

52:12.830 --> 52:15.097
That we have the right
to file a formal complaint

52:15.099 --> 52:19.067
and bypass the COs, and go
straight to the administration.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.602
You can't do that.

52:20.604 --> 52:23.839
If there's an investigation,
maybe they'll...

52:23.841 --> 52:26.141
maybe they'll transfer
me out of here.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.709
Where do you think you are?

52:27.711 --> 52:31.880
Administration would never side
with an inmate against the system.

52:31.882 --> 52:34.616
Everybody looks out for their own.

52:34.618 --> 52:36.652
All right.

52:37.854 --> 52:39.021
You're close.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.590
Just keep your head down.

52:41.592 --> 52:45.761
All right, once you're out of here, you'll
get a new girlfriend with bigger tits.

52:46.729 --> 52:48.163
Yeah?
You promise?

52:48.165 --> 52:50.065
Did your old girlfriend
have big tits?

52:50.067 --> 52:52.601
Um, I... no.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.237
I promise.

53:02.246 --> 53:04.613
What are you doin' here?

53:04.615 --> 53:06.882
Thought Roc was sending Drew?

53:06.884 --> 53:10.319
He couldn't come.
It's just me.

53:36.179 --> 53:37.379
Who the fuck are you?

53:37.381 --> 53:39.815
We're here to collect for Roc.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.985
The fuck you are.
I deals with Roc.

53:42.987 --> 53:44.953
Not his little schoolboy bitches.

53:44.955 --> 53:46.121
Come on, man.

53:46.123 --> 53:49.725
You know we work for Roc, it
doesn't have to be that way.

53:50.860 --> 53:53.195
Actually, let's do it
exactly this way.

53:54.964 --> 53:57.199
You wanna test us?
Fine.

53:57.201 --> 53:59.801
Pick it up.

53:59.803 --> 54:01.803
Pick it up!

54:02.972 --> 54:05.207
Okay, you pick it up.

54:05.209 --> 54:06.742
James, let's just...

54:06.744 --> 54:08.744
Pick it up!

54:13.950 --> 54:15.217
Now where's the money?

54:15.219 --> 54:17.719
What do you see here, man?

54:17.721 --> 54:21.156
Is this a fucking game
of cops and robbers?

54:21.158 --> 54:22.157
I don't have any.

54:22.159 --> 54:24.326
Bullshit.

54:25.695 --> 54:26.828
Bullshit!

54:26.830 --> 54:28.330
What's in the safe?

54:28.332 --> 54:30.699
Shut up!
Stop screaming!

54:47.183 --> 54:50.852
What are you doing?

54:50.854 --> 54:51.987
Yo!

54:51.989 --> 54:53.989
What are you doing?

54:58.861 --> 55:01.196
Bro, somebody's gonna see you.

55:04.067 --> 55:06.268
What the fuck!

55:06.270 --> 55:08.437
You're insane!

55:16.212 --> 55:18.213
Holy shit!

55:18.215 --> 55:20.382
What?
Look at this!

55:22.418 --> 55:24.786
How much you think
this shit's worth?

55:26.022 --> 55:28.256
You're an idiot.

55:28.258 --> 55:30.225
What was I supposed to do?

55:30.227 --> 55:31.393
Turn around and leave the room

55:31.395 --> 55:33.395
with my tail
between my fucking legs?

55:35.164 --> 55:37.733
With a gun on you?

55:37.735 --> 55:42.270
Yeah. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

55:42.272 --> 55:44.439
You wanna live to be like Roc?

55:44.441 --> 55:46.775
Then you gotta be smart.

55:46.777 --> 55:48.944
Stop doing 90
with a trunk full of drugs.

55:52.048 --> 55:55.050
I'd rather die young
than just coast through life

55:55.052 --> 55:57.319
without ever stepping up.

55:57.321 --> 56:00.021
Being a man is about
taking initiative.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.189
A man?

56:01.191 --> 56:03.024
You're not a man.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.427
You're just a little boy
with a death wish.

56:05.429 --> 56:08.230
Fuck you!
Grow up!

56:08.232 --> 56:10.232
What about Roc?
Is he a man?

56:10.234 --> 56:12.134
Is that why you fucked him?

56:12.136 --> 56:13.301
James.
Stop.

56:13.303 --> 56:16.872
What about those guys in the club?
Are they men too? I said stop.

56:19.008 --> 56:21.243
You're just a piece of ass to them.

56:21.245 --> 56:23.411
That's all you'll ever be.

56:28.518 --> 56:31.553
Don't you fucking
walk away from me!

57:10.427 --> 57:12.594
Unlock the fridge!

57:15.064 --> 57:17.065
Unlock the fucking fridge!

57:19.869 --> 57:21.870
Hello?

57:25.274 --> 57:27.442
Shit.

57:28.377 --> 57:30.545
I'm sorry.

57:33.115 --> 57:35.116
You have ID?

57:36.352 --> 57:38.520
Um...

57:39.422 --> 57:41.423
It's my dad's store.

57:41.425 --> 57:43.325
We live next door.

57:43.327 --> 57:45.560
I help out when I'm not in school.

57:45.562 --> 57:47.229
I dunno if you know this,

57:47.231 --> 57:49.931
but there's some lunatics
running around this hood.

57:49.933 --> 57:53.902
Especially at this time of night.

57:53.904 --> 57:54.903
He's drunk.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.371
So it's either do it myself

57:56.373 --> 57:58.340
or we lose the business
for the night.

57:58.342 --> 57:59.507
Fair enough.

57:59.509 --> 58:01.610
Anyway, I can handle myself.

58:08.551 --> 58:10.919
What happened to your hand?

58:14.156 --> 58:16.157
You scared of me?

58:18.294 --> 58:19.294
I don't know.

58:19.296 --> 58:21.463
Maybe.

58:24.533 --> 58:26.134
You want a cigarette?

58:26.136 --> 58:28.136
Maybe.

58:41.417 --> 58:43.585
Thanks.

58:55.431 --> 58:57.433
And what are you doing?

58:58.235 --> 59:01.002
Magic trick.

59:01.004 --> 59:02.203
Yeah?
Yeah.

59:02.205 --> 59:03.271
'Kay...

59:03.273 --> 59:05.240
You see?

59:05.242 --> 59:08.010
Full pack.
Mm-hmm.

59:08.512 --> 59:11.212
But wait.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.081
Little shake.

59:13.083 --> 59:15.350
And...

59:15.352 --> 59:17.485
they're gone.

59:17.487 --> 59:19.654
But wait...

59:21.257 --> 59:23.258
They're back.

59:24.427 --> 59:25.727
No way!

59:25.729 --> 59:27.028
Way.

59:27.030 --> 59:28.129
Oh!

59:28.131 --> 59:29.464
I applaud you.

59:33.670 --> 59:36.671
Who was that girl
you were with last week?

59:36.673 --> 59:38.273
Oh...

59:38.275 --> 59:41.176
that is, um, Crystal.

59:43.112 --> 59:45.113
She's all right.

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:16.411
What the fuck did you do?

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.513
Roc.

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:20.582
Calm down, bro.

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:23.151
This guy was trying
to screw you over.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.320
I was just showing
a little initiative.

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:28.423
A little initiative?

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:29.724
Yeah.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:32.727
I'm doing this shit for you, man.

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.597
Oh.

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:37.265
Thank God.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:39.667
'Cause, see,
that's not what I thought.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:45.140
I thought you got
your pride wounded.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:50.478
And that you stupidly,
without thinking about it,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.115
burned one of my contacts.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.217
My business partners.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.053
Just to make yourself feel better.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.220
That's not how it is...

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.422
Shut the fuck up!

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:02.724
It's not how it...
Shut up!

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:04.659
That's not all!

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:09.464
I also thought you stole
a huge fucking bag of guns

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:11.633
and brought it back to my house!

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.337
I oughta fill you
with fucking lead.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.739
James...

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.761
Then, James, I thought no.

01:01:42.164 --> 01:01:44.199
No.

01:01:45.367 --> 01:01:47.368
Jamesy Boy wouldn't do that.

01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:50.605
Jamesy Boy's smart.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:53.475
Jamesy Boy would know

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:56.578
that guns are a shit business.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.280
'Cause if we sell them
on the street...

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:02.250
any punk bitch
who gets busted with one

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:05.453
just to get a couple years
knocked off their time!

01:02:09.558 --> 01:02:11.793
Fuckin' James.

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:15.330
That is my money in that bag.

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:22.337
You and D are gonna figure out

01:02:22.639 --> 01:02:24.572
a way to fix this.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.442
You feel me?

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:28.877
Yeah.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:30.411
Hmm?

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.413
Yeah.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.192
Come in.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:46.528
Sorry to bother you, sir.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.696
This is with the medical kites.

01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:00.842
Put him in room four.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:03.211
Sir.

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:14.255
Must be important... if
you wanna talk to me.

01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:17.859
Take Cesario off the yard
until his hearing.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:23.364
Put him in PC.
He's too weak.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:26.367
You don't get into a fight for a week,
I'm supposed to think you grew a heart.

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.670
Somebody's gonna hurt him?
Great.

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:30.838
Gimme a name.

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:34.242
This is an inmate who was involved

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.844
in a near fatal knife fight
in my shower room.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.279
That's bullshit...

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.847
No, but I don't know
that because, see,

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.249
you didn't make a statement
at the time, did you?

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.517
So you're gonna let the kid die

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:43.651
to teach me a fucking lesson?

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:44.919
Hey, watch your tone, convict.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.788
Remember who you're talking to.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.257
There are 30,000 people
incarcerated in this state

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:51.726
right at this very minute,
you know how many work here?

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:53.394
3,000.
Total.

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:56.397
My COs come to work ten hours a day

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.833
completely surrounded
by assholes like you

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.403
who spend 24 trying out
how to murder him.

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.672
Big badge of honour to take down
a corrections officer,

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.673
ain't that right?

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.275
No, for Chris...

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.510
If I can't afford to make
the distinction...

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.313
you think I'm an asshole
because it's fun?

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:14.983
I do it...

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.352
because that's how my guys survive.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.824
I'm taking a real risk sitting
down with you right now.

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.896
I'm asking you.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.266
Person to person.

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.906
There's nothing I can do.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.580
Hey, yo, white boy...

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:53.755
Heard you been talking to Falton.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:57.392
You mention me,
or any one of my soldagos...

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:02.930
I'll make sure you get
your throat cut.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.066
Hey, controllate.

01:05:06.468 --> 01:05:08.002
It ain't my fault your
little bitch ass boyfriend

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.637
keeps on falling down stairs.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.073
You're gonna fuck up
his release, you know that?

01:05:14.743 --> 01:05:16.944
Do something.

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.982
You ain't got no heart.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.817
Do something, white boy.

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:24.919
Come on.
Hit me.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.889
I wanna see them revoke your ass.

01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:29.891
Right here.

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:31.392
Free shot, white boy.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:34.462
Take your shot, right here.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.631
Yo, wreck that motherfucker, JB.

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:42.737
Do something!

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.094
Excuse me.

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:44.966
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:47.535
Is Sarah around?

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.771
Do you know what damn time it is?

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.906
Dad, it's okay.

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:55.143
I used to take walks
like this with my mom.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:56.644
Yeah?

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:00.715
Before she got sick.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.452
The spine, yeah.
She got better.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:08.055
But she hasn't been the same since.

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.593
I think for a while there she
thought she was gonna die

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:17.698
and she was disappointed
that the world didn't stop.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.769
My dad still had the store,
I still went to school.

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.938
I made her angry.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.174
Man, you don't hold back, do you.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:29.844
I can stop if you want.

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:32.013
No, I didn't mean it like that.

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.653
I've been institutionalized
since I was six.

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.491
What did you do when you were six?

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.961
I was an angry kid.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:52.667
I used to get into fights,
break things, shit like that.

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:56.804
My whole life I've never been
to a regular school.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.740
And as far as I can remember,

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.176
every room I walked into...

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:04.712
they already knew
I was a lost cause.

01:08:06.648 --> 01:08:08.816
All I want...

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.985
is a normal life.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:17.524
What if a man came from the future
and said you'd have a happy life?

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:22.063
What if he showed you your future wife and
your children and you're all totally happy?

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.100
Would you be scared?

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:30.805
I don't know.
Not that it matters.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:33.608
I'm not the kind of girl
that rises above all this.

01:08:35.743 --> 01:08:38.845
I'm not so pretty and I
don't do that well in school.

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:42.950
Nobody's coming from the future
to tell us anything.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.118
Maybe that's true.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.924
But...

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:51.826
you are pretty.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.598
<i>♪ I been down</i>

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.233

Any news?

01:11:01.157 --> 01:11:03.157
Oh yeah.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:05.326
Cesario got revocated.

01:11:06.828 --> 01:11:08.829
Six years.

01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:10.765
Heh...

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.767
What's the matter, Burns?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.769
You look sad.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.742
Who is that?

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.010
Hey!

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.145
That's James.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.415
My friends, Robyn.
Hey, what's up?

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:04.852
You got to school here?
Uh, James goes to Roosevelt.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.389
Wanna play some ball?
We need another person.

01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:09.390
Sure.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:12.026
All right.
James is on my team.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:15.096
Cool.

01:12:15.098 --> 01:12:17.264
Ball, ball, ball!

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.203
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:24.238
Woo!

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.440
Get your man!

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:28.442
Ah!

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.783
James!

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.920
Woo!

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.956
Did you see that?

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.059
I didn't know you could play ball.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:46.494
Yeah.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.897
One of many skills I learned
courtesy of the state.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.832
Yo, James.
Hurry up man.

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.868
Yo!

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.272
Ew, you're all sweating.

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.782
'Kay, I'm gonna go play.

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.784
All right.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.024
What are you always writing about?

01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:54.929
Nothing.

01:13:57.532 --> 01:14:00.935
I'm gonna take you away from
this shithole neighbourhood.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.608
That sounds nice.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.080
Things are gonna be different.

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.150
We're gonna be different.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.103
Good.

01:14:55.056 --> 01:14:57.925
Look who decided to visit.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.227
You know, it's like
you're never here anymore.

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:03.564
I'm leaving.
The fuck you are.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:07.001
This isn't a good place, Crystal.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:10.070
It's a dead end.
You should get out too.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.238
With who?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.506
With you?

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.675
Do you love me?

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:17.678
No. You don't.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.414
You'd rather fuck that ugly
bitch from the store, right?

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.250
Don't talk about her like that.
Where you been that past two weeks?

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.685
Huh?

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:28.088
You been sleeping at her house?

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.290
You're stupid.

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.225
You pathetic little boy.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:33.560
And you're never gonna find
another woman like me.

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:38.232
You wanna what
me and Roc did last night?

01:15:56.017 --> 01:15:58.052
Yo!

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.656
Where you going?

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:05.526
I got the call this morning.

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:07.261
Chuck found the body.

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.263
The deal's tonight.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:15.703
What happened to loyalty, James?

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:19.139
What happened to riding
'till the wheels fall off?

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:21.442
Yo.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.110
I'm the guy who took you in

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.479
off the street and
gave you your shot.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.482
I don't owe you anything, Roc.

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:30.584
Okay.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:34.288
Let me paint you a picture,
Jamesy Boy.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:38.125
One year from now, and we
kicking it at the club,

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:41.328
doing better than ever,
wearing rollies.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:43.564
Reminiscing.

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:46.166
You know what we're talking about?

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:50.004
We talkin' about James, the pussy.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:53.007
James, who was less than a man,

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:55.609
and turned his back
on his brothers.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.778
You walk down that street...

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.049
Yo...

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:05.052
That's your legacy, kid.

01:17:13.561 --> 01:17:16.430
All right, just tonight.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:17.631
See, D?

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.299
I told you we could count on him.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.201
Jamesy Boy's the man.

01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:25.606
You know the drills, ladies.

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:26.774
On the line.

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:29.476
Have those ID badges out.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.745
Here we go.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.580
Move it in, mate, let's go.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:36.083
On the line.
Line 'em up!

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.317
Let me see that badge.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.353
Fall in.
Let's go.

01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:52.299
Hold!

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:54.301
Hold up.

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:02.309
Check him out!
Check him out.

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:03.510
Check him...
oh, hey, yo.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.712
Hey, yo!

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:12.352
You little whore, you better jump,
'cause I'm gonna make you wish you had.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:16.657
Don't come any closer.
Officer, stand down!

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:19.660
Cesario, do not do
this on my watch!

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:21.395
You hear me boy?

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:22.596
Chris.

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:23.597
Chris!

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:25.499
We can talk about this, son.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:27.701
Come to the office,
we'll straighten this out.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:28.702
Do it!
Come on!

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.237
He's doing it!

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:33.373
Think about what you're
fucking doing right now!

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:17.651
No!

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.665
Cut him down.

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:32.833
Get him up.

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:34.268
Sir.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.435
Get to your feet, inmate.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:38.205
Get up!

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:39.339
This is over.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.875
You understand me?

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:43.677
Look at me!
This is over!

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:46.313
It did not have to happen.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:47.781
Lock it down.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:49.216
Lock it down!

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.485
Move the fuck back!

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.587
The fuck... no!

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:55.756
God damn it!

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.962
God damn!

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:07.768
Calm the fuck down!
Calm fuckin' down!

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.503
Stop!
Right now!

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:10.704
Let him go.
He hit you!

01:20:10.706 --> 01:20:12.873
That is an order!

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.345
Put him back in his cell.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.888
Check that.

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.457
Put him in the hole.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.726
Lock it down.

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.895
Lock it down!

01:20:53.948 --> 01:20:56.383
Yo, something's up, bro.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:59.753
No, it's not.
Be easy.

01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.858
Text him again.

01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:11.898
There you are, right there.

01:21:23.978 --> 01:21:25.946
James... Drew.
A'ight, a'ight, fellas.

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.749
These are my boys,
Easy and Flash right here, yo.

01:21:28.751 --> 01:21:29.983

Uh, I got you man.

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.062
Yeah, yeah, check that out, man.

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:47.968
All right, that's what I'm talking about.
It's looking good, man.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:51.772
Yo, E, man, put this shit in the trunk.
Yo, back up, back up, back up.

01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:52.939

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:01.581
Man, hold up.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.683
James, chill.

01:22:02.685 --> 01:22:04.484
Hey, man, do it, yo.
Do it, man.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.919
Pay.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.754
Let's get that money, yo.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.589
You gon' get your money.

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.359
You wanna get paid, right?

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:14.494
Yo, E, man, hurry up.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:24.638
Motherfucker.
Yeah!

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.640
Get the fuck
outta here, man.

01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:33.814
There's no way out.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:35.615
They're gonna have to come back.

01:22:52.533 --> 01:22:54.401
Oh!

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:55.936
Come on!

01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:58.105
Yeah, I see a single gun,

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:00.807
I kill every one
of you motherfuckers.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.677
Man, get the guns!

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.545
Yeah.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:08.682
Oh, shit!

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:25.899
Man...

01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:28.068
They're gonna run
the tags on the car.

01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:32.038
We gotta get out of town.

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:36.977
You comin' or not?

01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:39.179
Fuck you.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.056
Sarah!

01:24:24.725 --> 01:24:26.860
Sarah!

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.938
Oh my God, what happened to you?

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.140
We need to get out
of this city, right now.

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:43.977
What did you do?

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:46.513
Pack up some things.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:50.684
We'll go somewhere far away
where nobody knows us.

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:54.521
What are you talking about?

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:57.257
There's my family, the store.

01:24:57.259 --> 01:24:59.626
I can't just leave.

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:05.198
But it's what we promised.

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.838
No, it's not.

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:15.709
Are the police looking for you?

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.189
You're asking me to throw
my whole life away, James.

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:35.095
I won't do that.

01:25:36.597 --> 01:25:39.299
You're the only thing...

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.301
I have left.

01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:45.672
I'm sorry.

Lieutenant Falton,
thank you for your patience.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:06.186
Of course, ma'am. James
Burns, 18 years old,

01:27:06.188 --> 01:27:08.021
originally arrested four years ago

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:10.323
for selling of firearms,
drug possession

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:12.692
and illegal possession
of a firearm.

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.327
Do you know the inmate
we're talking about?

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:15.929
Yes.

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:19.065
How long has he
been housed with you?

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.800
Four months.

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:23.303
And you oversee the
level five portion of the jail

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:24.938
where Mr. Burns was assigned

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.040
because of his history of
institutional violence, correct?

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:29.709
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:32.212
Three months ago,
the prisoner was involved

01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:34.014
in an altercation
in the shower room

01:27:34.016 --> 01:27:38.118
where another inmate was stabbed
with a homemade weapon.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.352
Well, well, well,
there was some other...

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.721
Yes, I know, please.

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.358
Yes.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.360
And the prisoner who was injured
had no record of violence

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:48.995
up until that point?

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.930
That is correct.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.699
Two weeks ago,
Mr. Burns was involved

01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:55.268
in an additional
altercation during roll call,

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.971
in which he severely injured
another inmate,

01:27:57.973 --> 01:27:59.372
beating him with his fists,

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:01.374
and in the course
of that altercation,

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.743
he struck an officer?

01:28:05.946 --> 01:28:07.947
Yes.

01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:15.288
Lieutenant Falton, is there
something you'd like to add?

01:28:17.858 --> 01:28:19.893
I'm sorry, excuse me?

01:28:19.895 --> 01:28:22.862
Is there some other
fact or series of facts

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.198
that you'd like to privy
the committee's attention?

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:31.471
Lieutenant Falton...

01:28:35.142 --> 01:28:37.310
No, ma'am.

01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:50.290
Come on, man, what the fuck?
Can't take the heat?

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:51.458
Get the fuck out of the game!

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.892
Oh, for real,
that's how you think...

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:54.160
Yeah, that's how I'm gonna play.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.730
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yo, get off my back, Conrad.

01:28:56.732 --> 01:28:57.897
Yeah, let me beat
the shit out this white boy.

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.801
This is what I'm gonna use to
dig your eyes out of your skull

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.136
and feed 'em to your homeboys.

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:05.238
Now get the fuck outta here.

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.311
What's wrong with you?

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:13.413
Don't you have a hearing
tomorrow morning?

01:29:13.415 --> 01:29:15.048
They're gonna revocate me anyway.

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.382
There's nothing I can do.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.985
No, son, I've seen
stranger things happen.

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:21.888
I've seen convicts who wore
suits to walk be revocated.

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:25.925
I've seen convicts who ain't got no
business outside that gate get released.

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:29.195
The people on that panel
are just that.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.330
They're people.

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:32.465
And all you gotta do
is convince one.

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.335
Yeah.

01:29:35.337 --> 01:29:36.870
I still got my pride.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:38.471
Oh, man, fuck that.

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.874
I bet you think
you being brave, huh?

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.208
Stoic.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.510
You're not.

01:29:43.512 --> 01:29:45.912
You're letting yourself
become a statistic.

01:29:45.914 --> 01:29:46.946
Yeah?

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:50.383
It's easy for you to say... lifer.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.818
Huh, motherfucker, huh?

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.319
Who the fuck you talkin' to?

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:55.488
You think I won't break your
motherfuckin' neck right now?

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:59.793
I'd give every limb I got for
1% chance at a real life.

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:02.228
Or a whisper of hope
to take a shit in privacy, huh.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.998
Now, if you wanna take the pass,
you go ahead and take it,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.133
you done this shit before,
motherfucker.

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:10.003
But don't you dare pretend
that that shit is courage.

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:11.271
Don't you dare.

01:30:11.273 --> 01:30:12.972
That's some weak-ass, fake-ass,

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.875
And you keep playing
pussy around here,

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.911
you gonna get fucked.

01:30:20.447 --> 01:30:22.816
You got some
pretty ass eyes, bitch.

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:38.064
Before this committee
renders its decision,

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:40.400
is there anything that
the inmate would like to say?

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.585
Not too long ago...

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:04.624
I saw an inmate kill himself.

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:11.631
He was my friend.

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:17.103
But I wasn't his, you know?

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:22.508
And maybe I could've helped,
I don't know.

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:28.181
But I'm gonna have to live with
that for the rest of my life.

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:36.055
And I don't think I've let the people in
my life down by making the wrong choices.

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.193
I think I let them down
by convincing myself...

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:43.529
I never had a choice to begin with.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:48.067
You're not the first committee
to sit at a table

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.536
and tell me...

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:54.240
I deserve to be an outcast.

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.409
And maybe you're not the last.

01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:00.947
But for the rest of my life...

01:32:02.616 --> 01:32:06.085
people will look at me
and know I was here.

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:11.958
They'll question my integrity...

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.628
and say I'm a monster.

01:32:18.999 --> 01:32:22.168
But this...

01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.971
right here...

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:27.006
it's different.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:33.346
It's different because
for the first time in my life...

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:35.515
I don't believe you.

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:40.987
Everything you've got
written there...

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:43.656
I did it.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:46.059
And most of it I regret.

01:32:49.396 --> 01:32:51.564
But...

01:32:52.399 --> 01:32:53.566
No.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:56.536
I don't have an excuse.

01:32:56.538 --> 01:32:58.705
I don't have an explanation.

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:06.512
And if that means I need to
spend four to six more years

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.681
before I get another chance...

01:33:11.151 --> 01:33:13.254
fine.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.590
I'm gonna have to
live with that too.

01:33:20.327 --> 01:33:22.495
But I will get another chance.

01:33:24.164 --> 01:33:26.466
And when I do...

01:33:26.468 --> 01:33:28.634
I'm gonna fuckin' own it.

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:33.373
That's all.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:00.201
This is it.

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.415
If I see you again...

01:34:04.941 --> 01:34:06.331

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:17.663
You know it's tough to get a
good job with a felony rap.

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:20.566
Yeah.
But it makes me sad.

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:25.238
Listen, I got few things
going for me right now.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.441
And I can always use
good people like you.

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:30.843
You say the words,
I'll put you on deck.

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.546
Have you driving a new fuckin'
car by the end of the week.

01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:34.780
No.

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:36.649
I'm trying to
fly straight this time.

01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:39.285
Do things right.

01:37:39.287 --> 01:37:40.653
Oh, okay.

01:37:40.655 --> 01:37:43.389
Can't help a man out that
doesn't wanna be helped.

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:45.491
Good luck at finding things
you want outta life

01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:46.859
at $7.50 an hour.

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:49.028

wanna get serious.

I'm James.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.077
I was just wondering if
Sarah's around.

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:48.080
I wanted to talk to her.

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:50.683
She doesn't live here anymore.

01:40:17.412 --> 01:40:19.578
You got engaged.

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:21.914
Yeah.

01:40:21.916 --> 01:40:24.083
Jake's at work.
What does he do?

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:27.787
Uh, he's a garbage collector.
He's a good man.

01:40:27.789 --> 01:40:30.790
You're happy.

01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:32.925
Yeah.

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:36.061
I'm sorry I didn't visit.

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:40.866
You did the right thing.

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:43.436
You moved on.

01:40:43.438 --> 01:40:46.939
Was it horrible?
Came through all right.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:50.576
The trick is to find
something that you love...

01:40:51.878 --> 01:40:54.647
and hold onto that...

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:57.983
James.
I wrote poetry.

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.155
Everywhere I go in this city

01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:06.725
I feel like there's something

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:10.062
trying to pull me back
into my old life.

01:41:11.631 --> 01:41:13.966
It's harder than I thought it'd be.

01:41:16.169 --> 01:41:19.872
And I need to get out.

01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:23.642
Where will you go?
Far from here.

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.979
Start over.

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:30.649
New York.

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.084
I dunno.

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:36.655
I can't afford New York, but...
James?

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.624
Yeah?

01:41:38.626 --> 01:41:40.726
Tell me a poem.

01:41:40.728 --> 01:41:43.729
Please?

01:41:43.731 --> 01:41:45.731
Okay.

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:52.638
In my mind, there's a boy
who exists in chains.

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:57.142
Inside a cold, dark room
of painful solitude

01:41:57.144 --> 01:41:59.778
is where he will remain.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:03.582
Behind these walls
the sorrow is inevitable,

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:07.086
as relentless as
the passage of time.

01:42:07.088 --> 01:42:11.123
Mentalities corrupt and
dark, brainwashed,

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:13.292
and hopelessly blind.

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.663
Prisons are packed
with crowded spaces,

01:42:17.665 --> 01:42:21.100
lifers and guards with
hollow faces.

01:42:21.102 --> 01:42:23.736
Shackled hearts afraid of changes,

01:42:23.738 --> 01:42:26.906
and weakened wills
become complacent.

01:42:26.908 --> 01:42:30.109
Yet, I maintain with patience,

01:42:30.111 --> 01:42:33.879
time can limit
but not shatter my will,

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.548
strength blazed across my chest

01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:38.217
as solid as penitentiary steel.

01:42:38.219 --> 01:42:42.821
But the silence speaks, it
tells me all I need to hear,

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:47.259
it confirms my beliefs and its
promises I have to fear.

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:51.697
It reminds me that without
freedom, I'm alone.

01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:55.000
And these whitewashed walls
don't make up

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:57.837
for blackened souls.

01:42:58.039 --> 01:43:02.708
I've given 95% of my boys
a handshake than a pound,

01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:05.744
before they were either locked
down or buried off

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:08.047
in cemetery grounds.

01:43:08.049 --> 01:43:12.751
What I've done is who I am,
but who I am is what I do now.

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:14.753
I won't let up or cease to fight.

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:19.058
Just time,
I plan on doing it right.

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:23.228
And what's right lies within me.

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:26.599
I'm learning to
appreciate my struggle

01:43:26.601 --> 01:43:28.133
for it would be hard to find

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:31.070
the joy of accomplishment
without it.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.308
We live and we learn.

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:39.712
We rise and we fall.

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:42.948
Like the heartbeat
of a sleeping giant,

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:45.217
with bittersweet dreams.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.753
