00:06.010 --> 00:08.895
Oh, my gosh, she did it.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.844
The vampire took all the
jelly out of this donut.

00:15.405 --> 00:19.390
And no weight gain because you're dead.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.370
The jelly does kind of look like blood.

00:23.404 --> 00:25.958
Yeah, that's why vampires
always carry jelly donuts.

00:25.992 --> 00:29.657
- You're awesome.
- I know.

00:29.691 --> 00:33.489
And I don't say that to any of my brother's
girlfriends 'cause they're all monsters.

00:33.523 --> 00:36.509
I mean, there was a centaur, a werewolf.

00:36.543 --> 00:38.221
Well, I'm a vampire.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.334
Yeah, but you have normal feet.

00:40.368 --> 00:41.373
Oh, that's true.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.885
OK, I gotta ask you something.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.243
Why would someone as cool
as you be dating my brother?

00:47.277 --> 00:49.921
Well, I find that if you're a little
bit cooler than your boyfriend,

00:49.955 --> 00:51.631
he'll never dump you.

00:51.665 --> 00:53.975
Ohh!

00:55.519 --> 00:57.295
OK, now I have a question.

00:57.330 --> 01:00.642
When you turn to a bat,
where do your clothes go?

01:00.676 --> 01:04.659
You know, you're not really thinking
about it when you're going...

01:09.615 --> 01:11.555
Yeah, well, when you spend as much time

01:11.589 --> 01:13.596
making dresses like this...

01:15.036 --> 01:16.710
...you want to know where they're going.

01:18.585 --> 01:20.593
Wait, that's actually your dress?

01:20.627 --> 01:23.370
Oh, I thought you were
selling pens, I'm sorry.

01:23.404 --> 01:25.007
I know!

01:32.669 --> 01:35.479
Oh!

01:35.513 --> 01:37.852
- Hey, Juliet.
- Hey.

01:39.056 --> 01:40.325
What are you doing here?

01:40.359 --> 01:41.731
I really wish I could hang out,

01:41.765 --> 01:44.037
but I have a ton of independent
studying to do, so...

01:44.071 --> 01:46.612
No, that's fine. I just came to
hang out with Alex and Harper

01:46.647 --> 01:48.852
and show them the jelly
donut thing with the...

01:50.491 --> 01:53.330
That was actually really cool.
She did the whole...

01:53.365 --> 01:54.802
- With the...? Ah!
- Uh-huh.

01:57.110 --> 02:00.184
You know, I think it's great that
you guys are hanging out together.

02:00.219 --> 02:03.561
I mean, my sister, my girlfriend, and...

02:03.596 --> 02:05.365
Your ex-girlfriend.

02:06.804 --> 02:09.209
It's OK. You can say it, dear.

02:09.243 --> 02:11.014
We're all cool here. -

02:13.420 --> 02:15.023
OK, whatever you guys do, just, uh,

02:15.058 --> 02:16.828
don't do too much talking about me.

02:16.862 --> 02:19.769
There's a lot to talk about
but keep it to a minimal...

02:19.803 --> 02:20.838
OK.

02:25.851 --> 02:27.721
Justin, we're not talking about you! -

02:27.755 --> 02:30.126
I was just... I was just checkin', you know.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.497
Gotta go!

03:24.445 --> 03:27.651
OK, Max, let's try some spells.

03:27.686 --> 03:30.591
Look, you're my conscience.
You're not the boss of me,

03:30.625 --> 03:33.395
so just tell me what to do and keep quiet.

03:36.468 --> 03:38.337
OK.

03:38.372 --> 03:41.409
All right, schoolyard spells
sound cute and innocent,

03:41.443 --> 03:43.212
but they can be very dangerous.

03:43.247 --> 03:45.851
That's why you practice
them on a spell dummy.

03:48.056 --> 03:49.591
You're calling me a dummy?

03:49.626 --> 03:52.129
No. I said "spell dummy."

03:52.163 --> 03:53.599
Fine.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.105
D-U...

03:58.140 --> 04:01.140
M-M...

04:02.975 --> 04:03.975
Y.

04:06.177 --> 04:08.344
Now I'm calling you a dummy.

04:08.379 --> 04:11.179
Good. Now that we've go,

04:11.213 --> 04:12.846
let's get to the spell, shall we?

04:14.916 --> 04:17.048
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

04:22.721 --> 04:26.256
Max, how many times have I told you

04:26.291 --> 04:28.492
not to do magic in the living room!

04:28.526 --> 04:30.960
As many times as I've done it?

04:33.163 --> 04:37.199
I'm sorry, I've been encouraging
him to work on his wizard studies.

04:37.234 --> 04:40.869
Really? Well, that's great.
What else have you been doing?

04:40.903 --> 04:43.605
He's been tricking me into spelling things.

04:46.007 --> 04:50.476
Wow! You've been helping him
with his magic and schoolwork?

04:50.511 --> 04:53.445
And don't worry, I'll make
sure he cleans this mess up.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.581
Oh, you're like the son
I don't regret having.

05:00.752 --> 05:03.019
Oh, she means Justin!

05:14.663 --> 05:16.864
Monster hunter Justin Russo,

05:16.898 --> 05:19.764
on the lookout for monster activity.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.376
Yeah, you better just be a hydrant.

05:43.987 --> 05:46.588
So far, all seems quiet.

05:46.622 --> 05:49.689
Perhaps a little too quiet... -

05:49.723 --> 05:51.290
My monster alarm ruined it!

05:53.393 --> 05:55.026
My monster alarm ruined it!

05:55.061 --> 05:57.929
There's three monsters on Waverly Place.
I gotta call this in!

05:57.963 --> 06:00.031
Wait! I sounded panicky!

06:02.067 --> 06:05.435
I've got to call this in.

06:11.941 --> 06:13.541
What was the number?

06:13.575 --> 06:15.676
Ah! -

06:22.917 --> 06:28.354
<i>Wizard Education Department, <
i>Rudy Tootietootie speaking. How could I
help you?</i>

06:28.388 --> 06:32.291
Uh, yes, this is, uh, Justin Russo,
junior monster hunter.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.561
I love the way that sounds!

06:35.595 --> 06:39.198
I would like to report three
unregistered monsters in my sector, sir.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.100
Three monsters?

06:41.134 --> 06:44.203
That's very good for a
junior monster hunter.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.672
Your mother must be very proud.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.442
My mother says my head's too square.

06:50.477 --> 06:54.180
I think your head suits your
shoulders very nicely, sir.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.918
Thank you. Now, when your
monster detector went off,

06:59.952 --> 07:01.386
what was the code that came up?

07:01.420 --> 07:04.522
Uh, I believe it was the letters

07:04.556 --> 07:07.023
R-U-N.

07:08.791 --> 07:10.457
What does that stand for?

07:10.492 --> 07:13.290
<i>Nothing. It spells "run".</i>

07:14.991 --> 07:17.593
<i>You've got level six monsters on yo
ur hands.</i>

07:17.627 --> 07:20.128
<i>This is well beyond the scope of yo
ur independent study.</i>

07:20.163 --> 07:24.231
<i>We're going to send in professional monster
hunters.</i>

07:24.265 --> 07:26.465
I get to work with
professional monster hunters?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.000
Sweet!

07:28.034 --> 07:32.369
<i>We'll send our two best guys to capture the
monsters. What?</i>

07:36.408 --> 07:40.177
<i>Really? They were swallowed whole?</i>

07:42.080 --> 07:43.747
<i>Yeesh!</i>

07:45.417 --> 07:48.952
<i>We'll send our second-best guys,</i>

07:48.986 --> 07:52.655
<i>who I guess now officially are our best
guys.</i>

07:54.190 --> 07:55.624
<i>Goodbye.</i>

07:57.260 --> 08:00.762
<i>That kid is gonna be a bone necklace
inside of an hour.</i>

08:00.797 --> 08:02.965
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

08:03.766 --> 08:05.367
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

08:05.401 --> 08:06.801
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

08:06.836 --> 08:09.804
Sir, you're still on the phone with me.

08:11.373 --> 08:12.974
<i>Oh. </i>

08:13.009 --> 08:14.976
<i>I wasn't talking about you.</i>

08:15.011 --> 08:18.180
<i>I was talking about another bone
necklace.</i>

08:22.783 --> 08:24.981
<i>How do I hang this thing up?!</i>

08:34.587 --> 08:37.020
It sure is quiet in here.

08:37.054 --> 08:39.789
Yeah. When my dad's out of town,

08:39.825 --> 08:42.458
I sometimes forget to put the open sign up.

08:46.130 --> 08:49.131
But I'll probably remember around 3:00,

08:49.166 --> 08:52.234
after everybody out
there's already had lunch.

08:52.268 --> 08:55.637
There's level six monsters on Waverly Place!

08:59.342 --> 09:00.708
Everyone stay calm.

09:05.247 --> 09:07.615
Everyone, take out the
emergency preparedness plan

09:07.650 --> 09:08.916
that I prepared in the fifth grade.

09:08.951 --> 09:10.885
No, no, no! Justin, what's going on?

09:10.919 --> 09:12.419
There's three monsters on Waverly Place.

09:12.454 --> 09:14.854
I detected them and reported them
to the Monster Hunter Council.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.724
- Wait. Three monsters?
- Yes!

09:19.094 --> 09:20.094
On Waverly Place?

09:20.128 --> 09:21.728
That's exactly what I said.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.166
Hey, you know who you should tell that to?

09:27.201 --> 09:30.736
Your vampire girlfriend and
her two vampire parents

09:30.770 --> 09:32.704
that live on Waverly Place.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.440
You're right!

09:35.474 --> 09:38.341
Because the three monsters
could catch them too!

09:39.176 --> 09:41.511
Just tell him.

09:41.545 --> 09:44.113
You turned in your girlfriend
to the Monster Hunter Council.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.082
What?!

09:46.116 --> 09:47.751
No, I didn't.

09:52.789 --> 09:53.955
Oh, no!

09:55.825 --> 09:58.326
Hey, who wants to see me empty a calzone?

10:01.329 --> 10:03.063
What's going on?

10:04.132 --> 10:05.199
I...

10:05.233 --> 10:07.601
...accidentally reported you and your family

10:07.636 --> 10:10.336
- to the Monster Hunter Council.
- You did what?!

10:12.137 --> 10:17.272
Well, hey, let's see you do
that calzone trick... thing.

10:17.307 --> 10:20.142
I... I want to see it.

10:26.153 --> 10:30.355
Wait, monster hunters are coming?
They're gonna put me in monster jail forever!

10:30.389 --> 10:33.890
Which is a long time,
because I live forever.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.492
You finally get a
girlfriend with normal feet

10:36.526 --> 10:39.328
and then you report her to
the Monster Hunter Council?

10:39.362 --> 10:43.633
I'm sorry, Juliet. I mean,
I just forgot that you were a monster.

10:45.671 --> 10:49.941
Because you're so pretty and smart

10:49.976 --> 10:51.976
and you don't eat spiders in front of me.

10:53.044 --> 10:54.511
Anymore.

10:54.545 --> 10:56.713
After that one time. Eww!

10:58.749 --> 11:00.684
I've gotta do something before
the monster hunters get here.

11:00.718 --> 11:04.320
OK, look, look, look! My brother
majorly messed something up,

11:04.355 --> 11:07.056
putting the woman he loves in danger,

11:07.090 --> 11:09.524
which doesn't surprise me
but curiously affects me

11:09.559 --> 11:10.959
because I kind of like this girl,

11:10.993 --> 11:13.995
so will everybody just calm down!

11:15.331 --> 11:16.931
Alex Russo's on it.

11:16.965 --> 11:19.333
Alex, this was my mistake,
she is my girlfriend,

11:19.367 --> 11:21.067
- and I'm gonna fix it.
- No.

11:21.102 --> 11:23.069
After what you did,
that whole girlfriend thing

11:23.103 --> 11:25.270
is hanging by a thread, so I'll fix it.

11:25.305 --> 11:28.972
We'll fix it. I'm gonna
go block the portal door

11:29.007 --> 11:31.074
to buy us some time before
the monster hunters get here.

11:31.108 --> 11:34.809
Oh, hey, that's number five on
the emergency preparedness plan,

11:34.844 --> 11:37.611
but I guess you can skip a few steps.

11:37.645 --> 11:40.080
Thank you for reading the plan, Harper.

11:41.882 --> 11:43.715
And there's no future for us.

11:45.619 --> 11:48.656
OK, um...

11:48.690 --> 11:51.426
All right, let's put our heads
together and think of something.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.096
Grab a marker, ladies. Let's start writing.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.334
OK, well, we should start
by getting rid of my scent

11:59.368 --> 12:01.668
'cause that's what the monster
hunters are gonna be coming after.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.903
Mmm, you smell like vanilla.

12:03.938 --> 12:07.106
Yeah, I wear that to disguise
the smell of death and decay.

12:11.576 --> 12:15.979
Well, this dress made of no
n-toxic permanent markers is pretty smelly.

12:16.013 --> 12:18.815
I could make you one.
What are your 50 favorite colors?

12:20.050 --> 12:22.184
Harper, no. We don't have time for that.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.987
But... we do have time for this.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.389
I'm rubber, you're glue.

12:28.424 --> 12:30.091
Take her smell and put it on you.

12:32.594 --> 12:36.330
Great. Now the monster hunters
will be chasing Harper.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.999
- Yes!
- Wait, what?!

12:39.033 --> 12:41.768
Well, what happens if they catch me?

12:41.802 --> 12:45.771
Oh, no, don't worry. They'll find out
you're a human impersonating a monster,

12:45.805 --> 12:48.173
and then they'll throw you
back like a little fish.

12:50.275 --> 12:51.442
I think.

12:54.245 --> 12:56.846
I've got it! I'm a monster hunter.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.347
They're coming after three monsters,

12:58.381 --> 13:00.349
so all I have to do is find three monsters

13:00.383 --> 13:04.152
other than Juliet and her family.
I fixed it!

13:04.186 --> 13:07.220
No! You just made a plan.
That's not fixing it.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.821
I did something constructive.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.790
I sent my best friend off
to her possible doom.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.295
Juliet, where did you get that dress?

13:17.329 --> 13:19.629
You know, actually,

13:19.664 --> 13:21.297
it looks really good on you.

13:21.332 --> 13:23.632
- Aww!
- You know what?

13:23.666 --> 13:25.833
I was going to be a lady
about this, but let's go!

13:25.868 --> 13:28.303
I want my dress back! Strip it down, sister!

13:28.338 --> 13:30.243
OK! OK, you guys, calm down.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.977
We have a couple of hours
to find some monsters

13:32.012 --> 13:34.046
before the actual monster
hunters get here, OK?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.815
- -
- I gotta get this.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.319
Hello?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.720
Hmm...

13:43.422 --> 13:44.555
Hey there.

13:44.589 --> 13:46.790
I'm Luxor. This is Dr. Ice.

13:46.824 --> 13:48.525
We're professional monster hunters.

13:48.559 --> 13:50.326
No, no!

13:52.596 --> 13:54.663
We were actually recently voted, uh,

13:54.697 --> 13:56.998
- best in the business.
- That's not true.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.533
The other guys were swallowed whole.

13:58.568 --> 14:01.704
Shh! Everyone loves us! We're the best.

14:02.906 --> 14:05.008
Someone barricaded your wizard portal.

14:05.042 --> 14:07.877
We were worried it might be monsters,
so we came through the phone.

14:07.912 --> 14:09.879
Lucky you guys get pretty
good reception down here.

14:09.914 --> 14:12.515
Sometimes it's just half of us,
maybe an ankle.

14:14.952 --> 14:18.354
- Whoa, what's going on? Who are these guys?
- They're monster hunters.

14:18.389 --> 14:20.556
I seem to be picking up a level six.

14:20.591 --> 14:22.959
Masked with vanilla. That spells vampire.

14:22.993 --> 14:26.795
Man, I hate those guys.
Their breath is like a punch in the face!

14:28.164 --> 14:31.498
No. It's on me. It's all over me.

14:31.533 --> 14:34.802
- - Come on, Luxor! Let's get her!

14:47.846 --> 14:51.779
Max is folding his own laundry?

14:53.481 --> 14:56.882
You're amazing. What... What did you do?

14:56.916 --> 14:59.151
Forget it. Just...
Just thank you, thank you.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.387
I'm only doing the folding.
Don't I deserve a hug?

15:05.422 --> 15:08.421
Sure! Maybe later.
I don't want to slow you down.

15:11.190 --> 15:12.991
He also made his bed.

15:13.025 --> 15:15.726
- You found his bed?
- Yep.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.795
I just peeled back the
mold and there it was.

15:19.664 --> 15:21.665
I'm baking you cookies, dude.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.801
- What do you like?
- Oatmeal.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.404
- I like chocolate chip.
- Shh! Keep folding.

15:29.006 --> 15:31.407
I'm out of oatmeal, but for you
I'm gonna run to the store.

15:32.876 --> 15:35.511
Max, if you want a snack there's
a pot of beans on the stove.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.950
Oh, I know what you're trying to do.

15:42.984 --> 15:46.353
You're not giving me advice. You're
trying to steal my mother away from me.

15:46.387 --> 15:49.954
Max, we have the same mother.
I'm your conscience.

15:49.989 --> 15:52.089
Not anymore. You're fired.

15:52.123 --> 15:53.957
You can't fire me.

15:53.991 --> 15:57.559
Ah, you should've thought of that before
you tried to steal away my mother.

15:57.594 --> 15:59.628
Look, I'm the third favorite in this house

15:59.662 --> 16:01.697
and no one is taking that away.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.833
Max, I can't go anywhere.

16:05.868 --> 16:08.636
Fine. If you're not gonna go,
then I'm gonna do my best

16:08.671 --> 16:11.105
to get away from you as soon as possible.

16:11.140 --> 16:14.808
As your conscience, I don't think
that's the right thing to do.

16:14.842 --> 16:18.044
Yeah. You know, you're probably right.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.046
But I'm doing it anyway.

16:23.982 --> 16:26.050
OK, are you still mad at me?

16:26.084 --> 16:27.684
Because I'm about to go out there

16:27.719 --> 16:30.853
and capture three new monsters
and might not make it back.

16:32.355 --> 16:34.522
Now you don't have to say anything,

16:34.557 --> 16:36.791
but if you're mad at me, you should kiss me.

16:36.825 --> 16:39.927
If you're not mad at me,
you should still kiss me.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.798
OK, well, only because you reminded me

16:44.833 --> 16:46.233
you might not be coming back,

16:46.267 --> 16:49.202
I'll give you a medieval friendship grip.

16:50.938 --> 16:51.938
Oh.

16:57.811 --> 17:01.313
- Ahem. - We're in here! Can't you knock?

17:04.383 --> 17:07.318
Yeah, sorry to interrupt your
weird display of affection,

17:07.353 --> 17:08.853
but, Justin,

17:08.887 --> 17:11.888
you don't have to go looking
for three more monsters

17:11.923 --> 17:13.823
because I already found them.

17:13.857 --> 17:15.825
Great.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.394
Uh, where are they?

17:17.428 --> 17:20.695
Well, when the monster hunters
eventually catch Harper

17:20.730 --> 17:22.364
they'll realize that she's not a monster

17:22.397 --> 17:25.433
and they'll bring her back
here where they will find...

17:25.467 --> 17:27.300
<i>?T×³ Ta-da-da-da! ?T×³</i>

17:27.335 --> 17:30.303
...these three real monsters!

17:30.337 --> 17:32.105
It was dark in there.

17:33.506 --> 17:35.874
This is never gonna work, Alex.

17:35.908 --> 17:37.909
You're just upset because
you didn't think of it.

17:37.943 --> 17:40.844
No, I'm upset because there's
only two things here.

17:40.879 --> 17:42.980
This is FrankenGirl, a monster I created.

17:43.014 --> 17:44.848
Hi, Daddy!

17:47.518 --> 17:49.452
A robot, which I also created.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.787
And the third monster is, oh, look...

17:51.821 --> 17:53.755
Nothing!

17:55.624 --> 17:57.557
This is never gonna work.

17:57.592 --> 18:01.260
Well, you guys have done a
great job trying to fix this,

18:01.294 --> 18:04.262
but, um... I'm gonna go hide

18:04.296 --> 18:06.896
because of the great job
you've done trying to fix this.

18:09.666 --> 18:10.932
Juliet!

18:13.301 --> 18:17.136
- - I'll make this right, Juliet, I promise.

18:28.212 --> 18:30.012
Markers, markers, go away, hey!

18:32.816 --> 18:34.483
All right, good news.

18:34.517 --> 18:36.650
I think I lost them.

18:36.685 --> 18:39.218
You know, you probably could've
ditched that outfit in the bushes

18:39.253 --> 18:40.886
and then they'd stop chasing you.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.357
Here's an idea: next time you want
to involve me in one of your spells,

18:45.391 --> 18:49.295
do something less painful,
like hit me in the head with a hammer.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.433
- -
- Oh!

18:52.467 --> 18:54.469
That's me. I gotta get that.
Excuse me, guys.

18:54.503 --> 18:57.772
- No!
- Hello!

18:57.806 --> 19:00.641
Hey! Got here a lot quicker.
You're on speed dial now.

19:02.711 --> 19:04.311
There's the monster. Blast her!

19:04.346 --> 19:06.415
- Hold on!
- I'm not a monster!

19:06.450 --> 19:08.986
They all say that.
That's a monster trick. Blast her!

19:10.322 --> 19:13.290
Not a monster. Sure does
smell like a monster, though.

19:13.325 --> 19:15.492
Yeah. Wow!

19:15.527 --> 19:18.460
You know, maybe it's us.
We've been running around a ton today.

19:20.062 --> 19:23.097
Well, I guess we better keep
hunting for the three monsters.

19:23.131 --> 19:24.798
No, you don't, you don't
have to keep hunting,

19:24.832 --> 19:28.401
because they're right here. Three monsters.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.470
Yep, see? One... two-three!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.371
OK, you can leave. Take them. Bye!

19:36.708 --> 19:38.710
- -
- Excellent.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.813
A homemade jobber.
You don't see those that often.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.648
Oh!

19:47.019 --> 19:49.021
- -
- Another monster.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.689
A robot monster from the future.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.424
So, where's the third monster?

19:55.359 --> 19:56.759
There's not three?

19:56.793 --> 19:58.827
I know there's three.
He's around here somewhere.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.963
Invisi-Monster, where are you,

20:00.997 --> 20:03.566
you invisible... monster?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.635
Here I am! I'm the monster.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.403
Max, what are you doing?

20:08.438 --> 20:10.238
I'm sick and tired of me doing all the work

20:10.273 --> 20:12.407
and Mom giving Conscience all the credit,

20:12.441 --> 20:16.110
so I've decided to live in a monster
jail for the rest of my life.

20:16.144 --> 20:19.180
As you can see,
I've pretty much lost control.

20:21.783 --> 20:23.250
Take me away.

20:23.284 --> 20:25.885
- There's your monster! Get him!
- Get him, get him, get him!

20:27.288 --> 20:29.622
-

20:29.656 --> 20:32.091
That's not a monster, it's just a boy.

20:33.926 --> 20:35.093
Look, there it is!

20:38.330 --> 20:41.731
Well, a watermelon with a wig.

20:41.765 --> 20:44.066
I've heard about these bad boys.

20:48.302 --> 20:50.436
They have to be put down right away.

20:51.938 --> 20:55.007
Justin, can Luxor and I
speak to you for a second?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.709
Yeah.

20:58.278 --> 20:59.778
I think I know what's going on here.

20:59.812 --> 21:02.246
- I'm dating a vampire.
- What?

21:02.280 --> 21:03.346
What?!

21:04.482 --> 21:07.584
Nothing! Vampire bites would hurt.

21:07.618 --> 21:09.920
I mean, owwie!

21:09.954 --> 21:13.757
Look, I was a junior
monster hunter once myself.

21:13.791 --> 21:16.424
You wanted to catch all three
monsters before we got here

21:16.458 --> 21:18.492
to impress us. I get it.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.228
Yeah, but you only got two of the monsters

21:20.262 --> 21:23.030
so you tried to pass off the
watermelon as a third monster.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.531
Genius!

21:26.100 --> 21:28.267
Listen, we're gonna let
it slide this one time.

21:29.602 --> 21:31.636
Could I have your phone?

21:31.671 --> 21:33.771
Thanks. -

21:33.806 --> 21:37.107
Transport. Yeah,
we got a two plus two situation.

21:37.142 --> 21:40.043
Us plus two monsters. Read the manual!

21:40.077 --> 21:42.712
No, seriously, I think there is one. OK.

21:48.985 --> 21:51.520
Justin, our fake monsters just disappeared.

21:51.554 --> 21:54.423
Uh, no, the monster hunters
took them to monster jail.

21:54.457 --> 21:55.924
Great! I'll go tell Juliet.

21:55.958 --> 21:58.493
I'll tell Juliet, she's my girlfriend.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.128
Well, she's my friend.

22:01.830 --> 22:04.465
You are friends with my girlfriend.

22:04.499 --> 22:06.800
Look, I know, I'm just as
freaked out as you are.

22:06.835 --> 22:09.269
- Let's just not talk about it. - OK.

22:09.304 --> 22:10.637
We'll tell her together.

22:10.671 --> 22:12.405
- OK. Fine.
- OK. Fine.

22:17.610 --> 22:18.877
No!

22:20.514 --> 22:22.281
It worked! You guys did it.

22:22.315 --> 22:24.783
I kind of wish I had caught
three real monsters, though.

22:24.818 --> 22:26.318
I would've gotten a trophy.

22:27.586 --> 22:30.654
Well, I guess my trophy's right here.

22:30.689 --> 22:34.491
Justin, as a woman of the 21st century,
do not objectify me.

22:36.093 --> 22:40.396
But as a woman who's been alive for
thousands of years before that...

22:42.031 --> 22:44.165
Oh, come here, you! -

22:47.736 --> 22:50.070
Hey, uh, Justin, your hand's a
little low on the hug there.

22:50.104 --> 22:52.439
- Oh.
- No, that's just me.
