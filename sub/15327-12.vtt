00:01.668 --> 00:06.423
- Oh, hey, girl,
I didn't see you there.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.092
[deeper voice] Oh, hey,
girl, I didn't see you there.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.760
- What are you doing?

00:10.844 --> 00:13.263
- Oh, hey, girl,
I didn't see you there!

00:13.346 --> 00:16.599
- Girl?

00:16.683 --> 00:19.394
Thank you. [laughing]

00:19.477 --> 00:21.479
So what are you doing?
- I can't tell you yet.

00:21.563 --> 00:25.108
But when you find out, I promise
you'll think it's bomb.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.110
- [violin music]

00:27.193 --> 00:29.279
- You're supposed to come
out when I say "prom."

00:29.362 --> 00:31.823
I said "bomb."
Go back! Go back!

00:31.906 --> 00:33.783
- Aw, you're asking
Gabby to prom?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.285
That is so cute.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.412
- Normally, this isn't
my thing, but...

00:37.495 --> 00:39.456
you know how Gabby is.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.333
- And you're whipped.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.127
That's even cuter.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.171
- Oh, hey, Steph.

00:46.254 --> 00:50.258
Look at you bein' all
not where we thought you were.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.469
- Why do you have spackle?

00:52.552 --> 00:54.971
- I'll tell you why
we don't have it.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.264
We definitely were not

00:56.347 --> 00:58.475
practicing circus
tricks on our beds.

00:58.558 --> 01:03.146
- And my head definitely
did not go through a wall.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.980
- Boys, this is exactly
why we tell you

01:05.063 --> 01:07.650
no jumping on the beds.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.820
- Steph, just stay calm.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.655
- [violin music]

01:12.739 --> 01:15.825
- He said "calm," not "prom."
Everybody, back!

01:15.909 --> 01:18.828
- Well, that was weird.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.247
- It shouldn't be so difficult.
It's one word.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.458
- Well, in their defense,
a lot of words rhyme with--

01:23.541 --> 01:27.295
- No, don't say it!
- Don't say what?

01:27.378 --> 01:29.672
- Gabby, would you
do me the honor

01:29.756 --> 01:33.176
of accompanying me to prom?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.845
- Yes, of course,
I'll go to--

01:35.929 --> 01:38.973
- Wait, don't answer yet.

01:39.057 --> 01:43.019
I said, would you go
with me to prom?!

01:43.102 --> 01:46.481
- Yes, I'm very excited!
- Great!

01:46.564 --> 01:48.441
- Let's go to prom!!

01:48.525 --> 01:51.152
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

{\an8}Lose something?
Flunk something?

And we'll know on Monday.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.876
{\an8}- Why are you pouring soap
into a sandwich bag?

02:47.959 --> 02:48.835
{\an8}- My school has switched
to powdered soap.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.297
{\an8}It's like washing
your hands with gravel.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.550

to work up a lather?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.224

turn it right around.

03:03.308 --> 03:08.354
{\an8}There is no hope
for you here.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.231
- What's up?
- It's about prom.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.233
- You're worried about that
thing your hair always does?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.944
- Now I am. Thanks for that.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.739
{\an8}I'm nervous about hanging
with a bunch of Juniors.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.574
{\an8}It's one thing to see Noah's
friends at school,

03:19.657 --> 03:20.783
{\an8}but prom is like--

03:20.867 --> 03:24.829
{\an8}- A minefield of potential
social disaster.

03:24.913 --> 03:29.208
{\an8}- I was gonna say real fancy,
but thanks for that, too.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.252
- Charlie, what happened?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.463
- He threw out his
back dunking.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.548
- What actually happened?

03:35.632 --> 03:38.301
- He saw a quarter.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.177
{\an8}- Hey, don't look
at me like that.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.055
{\an8}I needed a New Mexico
and I got it!

03:42.138 --> 03:43.598
{\an8}Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:43.681 --> 03:45.433
- I've gotta go call
Molly back.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.517
You think I'm
nervous about prom?

03:46.601 --> 03:49.228
She already sweated through
three of her dresses

03:49.312 --> 03:51.439
and she wasn't even
wearing two of 'em.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.567
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
My Molly's goin' to prom?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.946
- Okay, really creepy when
you say "My Molly."

03:58.029 --> 04:00.657
And, yes, some jock
named Thad asked her.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.494
- Doesn't this Thad know that
our love is a delicate dance?

04:04.577 --> 04:08.915
- Oh, please. You hit on her
and she completely ignores you.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.459
- That's the dance!

04:14.629 --> 04:16.589
- So, about this guy
from your school

04:16.673 --> 04:17.632
who's taking
my Molly to prom...

04:17.714 --> 04:19.841
- If you don't stop calling
her "your Molly,"

04:19.926 --> 04:21.844
I'm gonna swat you
with this pillow.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.430
- My Molly would never hit me.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.560
So, how big is this yahoo
takin' Molly?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.270
Could I whoop 'im?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.481
- I doubt it. He's the captain
of the wrestling team.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.858
- Oh, that's bad.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.735
Tough luck, James.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.656
- Not a problem.
My Molly doesn't like sports.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.826
- Charlie, why are you upset?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.577
The chiropractor
fixed your back.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.831
- You used my New Mexico
quarter in the meter.

04:49.914 --> 04:50.832
- Oh, please. Just go to
the bank and ask.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.167
They'll give you one.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.836
- It's not the same.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.630
You have to find it yourself
or it doesn't count.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.383
You never understand my hobbies.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.176
- So, how's the prom
planning going?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.804
- We're trying to decide between
a limo and a stretch limo.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.765
- Hey, how about I drive you
in Stephanie's minivan?

05:07.849 --> 05:11.269
I'll even take all your friends
for FroYo on the way home.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.854
- That's very generous,
Dr. Phillips.

05:12.937 --> 05:16.566
But we'll just order desserts
up to the hotel room.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.947
- Mm...

05:26.367 --> 05:31.581
This is what a heart
attack feels like.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.540
- Hotel room?

05:32.623 --> 05:35.877
- Did I not mention that?
[nervous laugh]

05:35.960 --> 05:38.254
- It's not a hotel room
hotel room.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.840
We're having an after party
in a hospitality suite

05:40.923 --> 05:42.759
at the hotel where the prom is.
- CHARLIE: Mm-hm.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.844
- It'll be us and a bunch
of Noah's friends

05:44.927 --> 05:46.554
just hanging out
for a couple of hours.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.473
- Oh, ho, ho,
that's totally different.

05:48.556 --> 05:52.268
In that case--no way.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.103
- My parents did this for
my sister two years ago.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.773
They liked knowing
she was safe.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.609
- Dad, this isn't a big deal.
Kids do it all the time.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.028
- Not my kids.
My kids are home at 11:00.

06:02.111 --> 06:06.115
- Right, I'll be
back at 11:00.

06:06.199 --> 06:06.949
- Hey, sit down!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.744
Nobody is going anywhere.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.539
- Shoot. I was gonna see if you
can pick me up some soap.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.588
- Now back to this hotel
room discussion--

06:20.671 --> 06:23.216
end of discussion.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.009
- Charlie, we need to talk.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.678
Meet me in the kitchen.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.890
- But I lose in the kitchen!

06:30.973 --> 06:32.475
You're not seriously
gonna support this.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.977
- Charlie, you're embarrassing
Gabby in front of her boyfriend.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.145
- I don't care.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.564
She is not going to a hotel
room for an after prom.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.399
- It's an extension
of the prom.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.193
You don't want her
to be the only kid

06:42.276 --> 06:44.237
whose parents won't let her go.
- Hm, you're right.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.280
Let's get on the phone
and start talking sense

06:46.364 --> 06:48.116
into some of these
other parents.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.617
- What do you wanna
do, Charlie?

06:49.700 --> 06:52.662
Follow her around the rest of
her life in a surveillance van?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.664
- Well, if she's gonna
go get in a hotel room,

06:54.747 --> 06:57.458
somebody's gonna be
surveilling from somewhere.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.129
- It's a safe, smart way for
them to celebrate after prom.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.215
She's going.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.550
- I hate the kitchen!

07:11.764 --> 07:14.600
- You look so beautiful, Gabby.
- STEPH: Aw...

07:14.684 --> 07:17.103
- She'd look even more
beautiful with sleeves.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.021
- Dad!

07:19.105 --> 07:21.607
- Honey, make sure
you get my good side.

07:21.691 --> 07:25.027
Who am I kiddin'?
They're both my good side.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.280
- Hey, Gabby, can I borrow
you for a second?

07:27.363 --> 07:28.531
- Why? Is something wrong?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.241
Am I wearing too much glitter?
Not enough glitter?

07:30.324 --> 07:33.244
Is glitter over? Why would you
let me wear glitter?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.454
- Gabby, take a deep breath.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.832
- I can't. It's a corset top.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.001
- You shouldn't worry about what
other people will think.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.878
- [sighing] That's the whole
point of prom.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.964
I need them to think,
"Oooh, look at that girl,"

07:45.047 --> 07:47.842
not, "Ugh, look at that girl."

07:47.925 --> 07:53.514
- Well, maybe this'll help.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.433
- Aw, thanks, Steph.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.851
Wow, is this real gold?

07:56.934 --> 07:59.896
- Girl, it's prom, not your
wedding. It's gold enough.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.147

08:01.230 --> 08:03.399

- Hey, guys!
- Oh, you look so cute!

08:07.945 --> 08:10.907
- You look so cute!
- BOTH: Ahhhhh!

08:10.990 --> 08:12.200
- Oh, she really does
look beautiful, huh?

08:12.283 --> 08:16.704
- Yeah, why couldn't
she be ugly?

08:16.787 --> 08:19.957
- So, listen, you know those
super cool Juniors

08:20.041 --> 08:21.584
Emily and Megan?
- Yeah.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.919
- They're gonna be
at our after prom.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.420
- Oh, that's great. We've been
dying to hang with them.

08:24.503 --> 08:28.507
- Yeah, they don't want
Sophomores there.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.592
- Oh. Well, we're going.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.593
Did they really expect
us not to?

08:42.145 --> 08:45.107
You're just part
of our delicate dance.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.945

her name was Holly.

hairspray it won't move.

Emily and Megan don't want
Sophomores here.

- Of course, they want you here.

- Oh, hey, Emily, Megan.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.324

10:02.143 --> 10:06.689
You're out? Dang.
Is Dad at home?

10:06.772 --> 10:08.357
Dad?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.817
- Oh.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.486
Hey, there.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.195
- What are you doing here?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.198
Are you spying on me?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.783
- Kinda.

10:17.867 --> 10:22.663
- Steph, did you know Dad
was here at the hotel?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.332
- Kinda.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.709
- I can't believe you guys.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.878
Why not just bring
the whole family?

10:28.961 --> 10:31.422
- Look at all this
free soap we found!

10:31.505 --> 10:33.924
Best night ever, huh, Gabby?

10:38.554 --> 10:40.973
- I cannot believe you guys
are here watching me.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.683
- He's watching you.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.518
I'm watching him--
watch you.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.480
- Why does anyone
have to watch anybody?

10:47.563 --> 10:48.564
And why are we doing this out
here where people can see us?

10:48.647 --> 10:51.525
- All right, let's all
go inside.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.528
- You guys do that.
I'll be hanging with Molly.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.280
[spits mouthwash]

10:56.364 --> 10:58.449
- No, we are all going
back into our room

10:58.532 --> 11:03.371
and you boys are gonna put that
cart back where you found it.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.998
- Those girls already
think I'm a baby.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.084
If they find out my Mommy
and Daddy are here,

11:08.167 --> 11:10.294
I'll have to go into
witness protection.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.380
I expect this from Dad, but you?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.423
- Your father and I support
each other's decisions.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.427
And we both agree--
that this was all his idea.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.347
- Yes, it was,
and a fine one, at that.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.681
- I'm just here to make sure
he doesn't do anything crazy--

11:22.765 --> 11:26.227
like go get ice when I told
him to stay in the room.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.478
- Well, I don't like
warm tap water.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.147
- Then grab a bottle
from the fridge.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.190
- Those bottles are $14.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.525
They try to pretend that
they're complementary,

11:32.608 --> 11:36.404
but they're not complementary.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.572
All I wanna do is go
across the hall,

11:38.656 --> 11:41.617

presence known,

11:41.700 --> 11:44.578
then come back over here and
watch something wholesome.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.788
- Wait? What?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.082
You said we were just going
to listen through the wall.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.167
- That was when I thought we had
the room next to them.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.211
Now that we're stuck
across the hall,

11:52.294 --> 11:54.964
holding a stethoscope up to
the wall's just plain silly.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.340
- Oh, you brought
your stethoscope.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.342
Can I see that for one second.
This is so cool.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.804
You are destroying my life!

12:01.887 --> 12:04.849
- Charlie, we are not
leaving this room.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.892
Gabby, put down
the stethoscope,

12:06.976 --> 12:09.562
freshen up your
lip gloss and go.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.605
Make some memories.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.609
- Fine. But if I hear
anything I don't like--

12:15.693 --> 12:17.736
anything--I'm comin' in.

12:17.820 --> 12:22.074
- You're right, Steph.
We didn't need that cart.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.326
We got all the good
stuff right here.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.791
- Oh, I worked up an appetite
outrunnin' that maid.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.759
- Nice dress--still.

12:40.843 --> 12:45.514
- Yeah, it was super cute--
an hour ago.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.268
- You look dumb.

12:51.937 --> 12:52.813
- I can't believe
you knew to bring

12:52.897 --> 12:54.356
an after prom outfit
and didn't tell me.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.983
- No, I didn't know.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.069
These were in case Thad ditched
me and I had to walk home.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.822
I mean, he thinks
my name is Polly.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.324
- Hey, Gabby, come on.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.533
Some of us are gonna race
luggage carts down the hallway.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.120

13:14.460 --> 13:16.712
It was tragic.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.174
- You know what's tragic?
This party.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.844
- Not tragic ha-ha, tragic dull.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.678
- Well, what's wrong with dull?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.306
Nobody ever barged
in complaining

13:27.389 --> 13:29.391
the kids across the hall
were too dull.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.062
- Gabby. Be fun.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.814
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
You know what's really fun?

that down, please?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.627
- Why?

13:56.710 --> 14:00.673
Do your parents know someone
who died from music, too?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.675
- Oh...

14:05.135 --> 14:08.722
- [music player thuds to floor]

Don't.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.829
Please, don't.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.165
- Why're you shovin' me?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.584
I brought your clothes.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.461
- Thank you. At least something
can go right tonight.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.297
- Well, you know
I'm here for you.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.091
I'm also here for that pool
with the swim-up bar.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.050
Now hand over your key card.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.761
- They'll charge everything
to the room.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.846
I can't give you my key.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.141
- Well, then, I can't
give you these shoes.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.268
- [sighing]

14:54.351 --> 14:56.437
Hope you brought a swimsuit.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.814
- I did not.

Fortunately, this works
in the gift shop, too.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.901

15:06.155 --> 15:07.489
- All right, buddy,
don't let me down.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.117
- I'm not sure about
spying on Molly.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.493
It doesn't seem right.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.121
- You get to ride on
a room service cart.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.456
- I'm in.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.041
- Now, remember, use the video
chat for spying,

15:17.124 --> 15:22.296
but also give me a couple of
stills for my scrapbook.

order this?

15:36.935 --> 15:39.271
- Hey, Steph, can I borrow
your cell phone?

15:39.355 --> 15:39.897
Aaron has mine.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.940
- Wait, where is Aaron?

15:42.024 --> 15:44.818
- Hiding in a room service cart
in Gabby's hotel room.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.322
If we get the video chat going,
we can see what Molly's doing.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.032
Or Gabby or whatever.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.701
- You heard the boy.
Give him your phone.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.120
- No, Charlie.
This is crossing a line.

And I won't be any part of it.

- Only if you throw it at
somebody and steal their phone.

- Gabby, we need to talk.

they have in that bathroom?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.988
- Thad? His name is Chad.

- Sorry I've been so lame.
But here's the deal.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.916

- They're spying on you?
That's so messed up.

totally embarrass us

Gabby's dress?

need it any more tonight.
