WEBVTT

00:14.306 --> 00:15.390
What the fuck just happened?

00:15.390 --> 00:16.642
- I don't know.
- Find out!

00:16.642 --> 00:18.977
- Cameras, stay on Yanko and Chris.
- Yanko, we lost picture.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.562
Get me Hyperion Mission Command right now.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.773
- Camera two, stay on Yanko.
- Keep it coming, Yanko.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.775
Is it us or is it them?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.568
- I need that feed back up. Come on.
- Mia.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.237
We have multiple end points.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.489
- Bradley, can you hear us?
- Checking with New York.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.031
- Checking on comms. Standby.
- Anything?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.867
- Nothing.
- Comms are out.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.911
- Is it us?
- <i>I know we can all feel that--</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:37.704
- What?
- What happened to our feed?

00:37.704 --> 00:38.914
I don't know.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.832
Damn it.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.336
Hyperion one, can you hear me?
Do you copy?

00:44.336 --> 00:45.838
You don't think that they...

00:48.215 --> 00:49.550
Oh, my God.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.386
- Hyperion, do you copy?
- Moving to secondary...

00:53.929 --> 00:55.180
Hyperion?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.767
<i>...curve of the Earth...</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:00.644
Fuck yeah.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.437
- Go Hyperion two.
- Thank God.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.022
<i>It's so vast.
I've truly never seen anything like it.</i>

02:42.120 --> 02:43.997
Well, don't you love
when you go to the movies,

02:43.997 --> 02:47.918
you're expecting a drama,
but instead you get a thriller?

02:47.918 --> 02:52.422
That's edge-of-your-seat stuff,
and I'm sure Alex is kicking herself.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.260
Your star was supposed to
make space look safe and appealing.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.345
Instead, she is AWOL,

02:58.345 --> 03:02.057
and people are blaming my rocket
for your transmission fuckup.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.727
You have no idea how much this cost me.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.342
They're here.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.015
All right. Let's go eat it.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.189
- Sorry, guys. Hi. So sorry.
- We're here. Sorry.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.317
We found a flight
Alex didn't want to skip.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.527
So good of you to join us.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.237
Did you get my message?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.656
I got it. Loud and clear.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.241
Okay, great.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.832
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Hey.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.584
Yeah. I'm okay. Did you see Luna?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.252
No. The cops wouldn't let me in there.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.754
- It was so fucked-up.
- Goddamn it.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.257
Okay, look. Most important
thing is that you're here and you're safe.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.884
That scared the shit out of us up there.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.636
It was just crazy.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.972
- Paul Marks.
- Yeah.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.141
He's an asshole.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.434
Yeah.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.453
So, Cory wants to sell the network?

04:46.995 --> 04:50.874
And Marks promises to stay hands-off?
Right.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.669
- That's right.
- Okay.

04:53.669 --> 04:56.338
I see why
you've dragged me downtown tonight.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.423
Well, I just didn't think it could wait.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.093
Listen, Cory's way out over his skis.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.930
Billionaires like Paul Marks
don't give a damn about legacy media.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.432
This is a money grab, pure and simple.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.893
These men, they just think
they're masters of the universe,

05:10.435 --> 05:14.648
and it just-- it pisses me off.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.484
Is that why you pulled
that disappearing act,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.069
'cause you were pissed off?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.699
You know what would have happened
if I went up in that rocket.

05:23.699 --> 05:27.703
Yes, Procter & Gamble would have
sent me champagne. But no.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.539
Now they're threatening
to pull their ad commitments,

05:30.539 --> 05:33.458
because they can't trust you
to show up to work.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.627
Oh, my God, Cybil. Are you kidding me?

05:36.712 --> 05:38.547
That launch was a setup.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.801
It was a promo for a deal
that would have killed our credibility.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.095
We have credibility?

05:47.222 --> 05:50.893
Paul Marks is gonna
fold the news division into an algorithm

05:51.685 --> 05:54.813
or make it a mouthpiece for Hyperion.
Whatever it is, we're fucked.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.026
And what if, God forbid,
they move forward with the deal,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.236
and the FTC doesn't approve it?

06:02.237 --> 06:03.655
You've thought this through.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.951
Cybil, if you take this to the board,

06:08.952 --> 06:11.455
I will go to talent in the news division,
I'll rally the troops,

06:11.455 --> 06:13.040
and we'll just shut this whole thing down.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.376
Trust me, this deal will not happen.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.754
Okay.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.340
Keep this between us for now.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.760
Give me some time to work the board.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.013
That son of a bitch.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.272
Good morning. Today is March 17th.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.234
Happy Saint Patrick's,
also known as the Day of Luck.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.694
And I've got my green on right here,

06:42.694 --> 06:46.031
and I'm feeling so lucky today
to be a part of the UBA family.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.284
- Punish her.
- I would love to.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.453
Are we going to put Alex in stocks
in the town square,

06:51.453 --> 06:53.997
- or are we gonna go straight to the rack?
- Suspend her. Fine her.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.249
I don't care.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.918
Isn't the point of having a dick
that you get to throw it around?

06:58.794 --> 07:00.087
You're thinking of a Frisbee.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.674
It was a fight to get Alex back on <i>TMS</i>
two days a week.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.050
A suspension is a gift.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.927
W-- She has other shows.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.222
That are carrying UBA+.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.474
Hey, I like my nose.
I've got no desire to spite my face.

07:12.474 --> 07:16.061
Is Alex Levy the head of this network,
or are you?

07:16.061 --> 07:19.565
Because from what I can tell,
she thinks she runs this place.

07:19.565 --> 07:23.652
Wow. You are coming in hot today, Cybil.
Since when do you care about talent?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.988
If you go rogue,
you are going to pay for it.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.240
I don't care
how powerful you think you are.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.204
What if Alex had to spend more time
on <i>TMS</i>?

07:34.204 --> 07:38.333
Ratings go up when she's on air.
We could sell the bump at upfronts.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.629
I like it.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.214
Okay.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.427
Fine. Let's chain Alex to the teacup.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.388
What now?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.724
More of your cost cutting?

07:55.976 --> 07:59.271
<i>The way everyone jumped in
for me yesterday.</i>

07:59.271 --> 08:01.690
- <i>How are you feeling?</i>
- <i>I feel so much better.</i>

08:01.690 --> 08:05.027
<i>I really do. And I'm so grateful
to Bradley Jackson.</i>

08:05.027 --> 08:07.279
- <i>Talk about ride or die.</i>
- <i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

08:07.279 --> 08:10.282
<i>Bradley is as ride or die as they come.</i>

08:10.282 --> 08:14.411
<i>In fact, here's our evening news anchor,
Bradley Jackson.</i>

08:14.912 --> 08:17.789
- Hey, y'all. Hi.
- Hi, you.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.374
<i>Oh, boy, did you have...</i>

08:19.374 --> 08:21.710
God. We keep this up,
I'm gonna need some insulin.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.962
It's fucking great, and nobody asked you.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.673
And if you keep stress eating like that,
you're gonna need some for real.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.510
Yeah, but how am I gonna fill the hole
where my soul should be?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.054
So Bradley, what was going through
your head when they said

08:32.054 --> 08:34.890
that you were going to be taking
that ride instead of Alex?

08:34.890 --> 08:38.227
Absolute terror just to be honest.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.188
But the Hyperion team
walked me through every step.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.567
<i>And once we were up there,
I could just enjoy the experience,</i>

08:45.567 --> 08:50.030
you know? And I have to say,
that view really does blow your mind.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.325
- I mean, wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. I can--

08:54.618 --> 08:55.619
- Only imagine.
- Yeah.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.537
Yeah.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.206
And zero gravity, I mean,
we were only weightless for about...

08:59.206 --> 09:00.749
Prompter.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.417
- What's happening?
- We lost prompter.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.877
Now, that's really interesting.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.797
- Why can't I see prompter?
- It's okay. Just hold on.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.634
And you know, these short-term flights
really are the key

09:10.634 --> 09:13.887
to making the long-haul
space travel possible. So this team...

09:13.887 --> 09:15.514
- Reboot the promp--
- Reboot the prompter.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.473
Rebooting.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.766
- Wow.
- Sorry.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.562
What would you say
was the most exciting part?

09:21.562 --> 09:25.148
I would say the view
as I was reapproaching Earth.

09:25.941 --> 09:26.942
It made me cry.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.153
Oh, my God, Bradley Jackson,
are you going soft on us?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.447
- <i>Maybe a little. Maybe.</i>
- Rolling without the prompter.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.532
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

09:34.032 --> 09:37.160
- What was that?
- Think the door just locked.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.453
- <i>Please.</i>
- <i>Will you cook?</i>

09:38.453 --> 09:39.580
- Will I cook?
- Yes.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.125
You wouldn't want me--
I love you too much to do that to you.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.209
Ready on three.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.502
<i>It could be an adventure.</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:49.089
Can't believe Fred's last directive
was to change the fucking lock system.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
<i>Well, then
Chris will have to bring some wine.</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:52.009
<i>I can do that.</i>

09:52.009 --> 09:54.303
Mike, Andrew, John, can you guys hear me?

09:54.303 --> 09:55.387
What the f--

09:55.387 --> 09:57.764
<i>We have to celebrate.
You're the first female journalist...</i>

09:57.764 --> 10:00.309
Is this protocol if there's,
like, an active shooter or something?

10:00.309 --> 10:01.602
- What?
- Should we call security?

10:01.602 --> 10:04.104
They lock it down automatically
if there's a shooter.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.355
- Line is dead.
- We should--

10:05.355 --> 10:07.649
- Donny, let's cut to commercial.
- The comms are dead.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.776
I mean, we can't be on the air
if somebody's in the building, so--

10:09.776 --> 10:12.196
Stella's not picking up. So--

10:12.196 --> 10:14.198
Okay. I think we're gonna need
a lot of wine.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.700
- Why don't we just--
- It's fine.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.452
What the fuck, guys? What's going on?

10:18.452 --> 10:19.661
I'm trying to get through, but--

10:19.661 --> 10:20.871
This is crazy.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.248
- Donny, try the comms again.
- Camera one, can you hear me?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.791
Camera two.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.293
Maybe it's a fire!

10:26.293 --> 10:27.336
Just calm down!

10:27.336 --> 10:30.631
- Julia, come in, come in!
- Get the talent out of there. Julia?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.300
Alex? They can't hear us.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.511
- What's going on?
- We're off the air. We sh--

10:35.511 --> 10:37.179
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah. Come on.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.640
- Julia, what is this? What's happening?
- Not sure.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.308
We might have a security situation here.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.809
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.020
I've been trying to get a hold
of building management.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.315
Remember when they sent that pipe bomb
to YDA right after the election?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.026
Open it!

10:51.735 --> 10:52.736
Get 'em out!

10:55.822 --> 10:56.907
Oh, shit!

10:57.991 --> 10:58.992
What the f--

11:00.327 --> 11:02.037
Mu, can you take care
of the staff, please?

11:02.037 --> 11:03.997
We're gonna go
to our dressing rooms now. Okay?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.582
We're just gonna lock the doors.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.043
We're gonna get behind something heavy,
preferably not me.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.586
Watch the glass right there.
Watch the glass.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.963
- Jesus.
- Wait, what's going on?

11:10.963 --> 11:15.425
I don't know, but Mia wants us all out
of there, so that's what we are doing.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.052
Okay, well, what are you gonna do?

11:17.052 --> 11:18.637
I'm gonna try and figure out
what's going on.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.556
But look, it's gonna be fine.
Lock the door.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.058
This is just standard procedure
if there's an intruder.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.018
- Come to my room, guys.
- Okay, yeah.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.353
- Wait, I'm gonna go with you.
- No, Bradley--

11:26.353 --> 11:29.273
If that door closes, we're locked out
of the building. Come on.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.607
Where are you going?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.109
I don't know. Take the elevator?

11:32.109 --> 11:34.444
Really? We're gonna take the elevator,
while the electrical system is--

11:34.444 --> 11:36.446
I don't know. You have a better idea?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.407
- It's working.
- Okay. All right.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.826
- Okay.
- Up, up.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.245
Okay.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.456
- All right.
- Yeah.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.460
- Fuck! Okay.
- Oh, shit. Okay. All right,

11:51.128 --> 11:54.548
- press the bell, the alarm.
- What-- It's not working.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.842
- Do you have service?
- No.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.761
- Oh, my God. This was a bad idea.
- It's okay.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.305
- Okay.
- We're good.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.389
Yeah.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.358
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, babe. Listen--

12:13.942 --> 12:15.694
Okay. There's something
going on in the building.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.404
- <i>There's some trouble?</i>
- And we don't know--

12:17.404 --> 12:20.073
- No, we don't know what it is yet but--
- <i>Okay.</i>

12:22.326 --> 12:24.453
And it's probably a false alarm.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.914
- <i>I'm just glad you called.</i>
- Yeah, just in case.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.831
<i>Daddy!</i>

12:27.831 --> 12:29.750
<i>Naima, say hi to Mommy.</i>

12:31.126 --> 12:33.837
- Hey, sweet pea.
- <i>Mommy.</i>

12:33.837 --> 12:37.132
- Hey. Are you having a good day?
- <i>Pancakes.</i>

12:37.132 --> 12:42.513
- You had pancakes?
- <i>Yeah. It was yummy.</i>

12:42.513 --> 12:43.597
Okay. Well...

12:45.307 --> 12:50.521
Mommy loves you very, very much, okay?

12:50.521 --> 12:51.605
<i>Love you, Mommy.</i>

12:51.605 --> 12:53.232
- See you soon.
- <i>Hey, I'm here.</i>

12:53.232 --> 12:55.484
- Okay. Love you, Daddy.
- <i>Love you too, baby.</i>

13:03.450 --> 13:06.745
- I'm a little-- Jesus.
- I know. Come on. I know.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.623
- I'm, like, a little-- You know?
- Yeah, of course. It's okay.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.417
We're okay. Whatever this is,
we're gonna be okay.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.379
Still can't access any of the pre-tape.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.840
- I'm shut out.
- So am I. Everything's frozen.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.007
Affiliates are fine.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.844
No one's reporting anything. No police
presence, no power outages with--

13:24.304 --> 13:25.722
- Is it over?
- I hope so.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.307
- YDA's still on.
- Switch is on.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.564
What the hell is that?

13:35.691 --> 13:39.695
This isn't a shooter.
Someone's in the system.

13:43.907 --> 13:44.992
Secure the control rooms

13:44.992 --> 13:47.536
and let affiliates know they'll need
to fill time until further notice.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.746
And don't say "cyberattack." Not yet.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.748
- Where's our CISO?
- Five minutes out.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.876
Clear the bull pen. Send him
and his team up when they get here.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.961
And get that music turned off!

13:57.379 --> 14:00.716
Believe me.
We'll work as quickly as we possibly can.

14:00.716 --> 14:03.385
I understand. But if we can't broadcast,
we're dead.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.970
How soon can we get back on the air?

14:04.970 --> 14:07.222
Whoever's doing this has most
of the building systems locked up.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.141
- It's gonna take some time.
- What was the attack vector?

14:09.141 --> 14:11.226
- How'd they get in?
- We're running diagnostics.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.187
Was it a phishing email?
Are our devices compromised?

14:13.187 --> 14:14.938
We just got here. I'll have an--

14:16.857 --> 14:20.277
We just got here. I'll have an hour-one
hypothesis in an hour.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.364
Any idea who's behind it?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.991
Russia? North Korea?

14:25.991 --> 14:29.536
All I can tell you now is they're
sophisticated and the penetration is deep.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.163
Well, maybe the French then.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.166
I'll update you soon as I know anything,

14:34.166 --> 14:35.918
which would mean actually getting
to work instead of standing here,

14:35.918 --> 14:38.587
- talking about things we don't know.
- Fine. Got it. Thank you.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.593
This is bad.

14:44.593 --> 14:45.719
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:48.430
- Looks like performance reviews.
- For everyone?

14:48.430 --> 14:52.392
Yeah, and there's some kind
of grading system. Tier one, tier two.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.354
- Where'd it come from?
- Corporate. I got it too.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.314
We're definitely not supposed to see this.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.690
- Uh-uh.
- I'm tier three.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.526
- That doesn't sound good.
- No.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.194
- No, it's not.
- Can you see my file?

15:02.194 --> 15:06.114
Apparently, I don't show initiative,
and I don't respond to criticism well.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.117
Fuck them and their HR bullshit.
Do I not show initiative?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.786
Look, this is some <i>Hunger Games</i> shit.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.746
They're basically deciding
who they can fire.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.374
- This is bullshit.
- Where are you going?

15:15.374 --> 15:17.334
Call me if we're gonna
do the show tomorrow.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.753
Are we doing a show tomorrow?

15:19.753 --> 15:22.130
I need to know exactly what they have.

15:27.344 --> 15:31.265
Victor, this may come as a shock to you,
but I can't read your mind.

15:33.058 --> 15:37.145
Internal databases, at a minimum,
and some degree of email access.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.106
All right.
What about the film slate and pilots?

15:40.482 --> 15:41.483
Maybe.

15:41.483 --> 15:45.070
Maybe? Come on.
That's a billion-dollar maybe, Victor.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.197
I need to know what kind of damage
we are looking at.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.992
If they have medical records
or subscriber data,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.493
we have to call the FBI.

15:51.493 --> 15:55.038
Then you're looking at employee lawsuits,
class action.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.915
You know,
every time that you start to speak,

15:56.915 --> 15:59.751
things feel like they're getting worse.
That's a special gift.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.922
- Check your email.
- I think--

16:03.922 --> 16:05.966
Yeah, I don't think I'm supposed
to check my email.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.259
You need to see this.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.400
<i>Hey, Laura. I know you're out for a run,</i>

16:23.400 --> 16:26.653
<i>so I figured you could use
a little motivation on your way home.</i>

16:27.154 --> 16:30.073
<i>I'm gonna be waiting for you
in the bedroom just like this.</i>

16:35.871 --> 16:37.122
Get Bradley Jackson up here.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.459
And call Laura Peterson.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.052
What do you think is happening out there?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.970
I don't know. I can tell you
what's happening here, though.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.933
It's extreme regret for the venti coffee
I had an hour ago.

16:55.933 --> 16:59.394
- That's disgusting.
- Alex is gonna be pissed, man.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.230
She hates it
when she can't get in touch with me.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.357
What does it feel like
being her whipping boy?

17:03.357 --> 17:05.858
I don't know. What does it feel like
being annoying as fuck?

17:07.361 --> 17:08.819
Sorry, that was-- a little--

17:08.819 --> 17:13.242
I'm just a little claustrophobic,
and-- Is this what the shuttle's like?

17:14.201 --> 17:18.872
No. Like, out that window
is just vast, infinite--

17:19.373 --> 17:21.875
Trippy. How was Del Rio?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.711
Not that. It was a shit show, honestly.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.380
I wish I could've been there.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.383
Yeah. You and Alex in the field,
more <i>Cagney & Lacey</i> action.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.593
Or Woodward and Bernstein?

17:31.593 --> 17:33.762
You know, we could use another
set of eyes on the footage.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.222
Would you be up for looking at it?

17:36.598 --> 17:39.518
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.

17:39.518 --> 17:40.978
Get me the fuck out of here.

17:43.313 --> 17:47.234
- Oh, my God. That was crazy.
- There it is. Nineteen messages.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.986
- This is what I'm talking about.
- What are they saying?

17:48.986 --> 17:50.571
- There you are. Where have you been?
- Hey.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.865
- We were stuck in that elevator.
- In the elevator for an hour.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.032
What's happening? Are we being hacked?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.826
God, it's a nightmare.
That's what they're saying.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.953
Is it just the building,
or is it our emails and...

17:57.953 --> 17:59.538
- I don't know.
- ...text messages?

17:59.538 --> 18:00.956
- Oh, shit. Oh, my God, Chip.
- What?

18:00.956 --> 18:03.041
My home office,
it's connected to the servers here,

18:03.041 --> 18:04.960
and that's the computer Lizzy uses
when she comes to visit.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.837
Don't worry about it.
I will grab Isabella. We will handle it.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.797
- Don't worry about it. It's good. Yeah.
- Thank you. All right--

18:08.797 --> 18:10.465
Bradley, Mr. Ellison wants to see you
in his office.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.468
- Okay. Did he say what it was about?
- Nah, he didn't.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.847
- All right.
- Stairs.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.140
Stairs. Yes.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.647
Hey, is he in there?

18:38.535 --> 18:39.369
Bradley.

18:44.041 --> 18:48.378
I'm so sorry. I can't imagine
how you're feeling right now.

18:50.756 --> 18:53.675
I told them that you sent that video
when we were in Montana.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.846
The good news is it hasn't gone wide.

18:58.514 --> 19:00.724
As far as we know,
I'm the only one who got it.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.312
I'm sorry, but we really need to know.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.606
Did you record that
on your personal phone?

19:15.239 --> 19:16.240
Yeah.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.118
Okay, is your phone connected
to our wireless network?

19:22.663 --> 19:23.872
They have access to everything,

19:23.872 --> 19:25.916
anything that's connected
to our network servers.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.377
So all my data's been compromised too?

19:30.295 --> 19:34.049
If they're singling you out maybe it's
because of our January 6th coverage.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.636
They want...

19:38.971 --> 19:43.517
- 50 million within 48 hours.
- Okay, is that even possible?

19:43.517 --> 19:45.811
I'm getting another message.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.104
<i>They have access to everything,</i>

19:47.104 --> 19:49.106
<i>anything that's connected
to our network servers.</i>

19:52.150 --> 19:54.486
Wow.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.491
Everyone, give me your phone
right now. Come on.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.468
Bradley?

20:21.138 --> 20:22.472
I'm fine.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.641
You can talk to me.

20:26.810 --> 20:30.314
Look, no one else was supposed
to see that. You were violated.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.159
You don't--

20:43.160 --> 20:44.703
You don't have to be strong.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.707
You don't have to pretend
everything's okay.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.419
Just tell me what you need.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.841
To be alone.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.761
I just need to be alone.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.149
All right. We need this place locked down,
security cameras off,

21:14.149 --> 21:15.609
anything with a microphone gone.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.361
And try to make sure
nobody does anything stupid,

21:17.361 --> 21:18.862
which I know is a tall order, but--

21:18.862 --> 21:21.990
Our stock price took a swan dive
into an empty pool after <i>TMS</i> went dark,

21:21.990 --> 21:23.700
and the bad news isn't even out yet.

21:24.535 --> 21:27.120
- What bad news? What bad news, Stella?
- What?

21:27.120 --> 21:31.333
This hack,
it proves UBA is a beacon of democracy.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.085
We'll be all over the headlines.

21:33.085 --> 21:35.254
"An award-winning network,
a beloved network,

21:35.254 --> 21:38.298
targeted by the shadowy enemies
of free speech."

21:39.383 --> 21:42.553
We're gonna use that ransom
email for this year's Emmy campaign.

21:42.553 --> 21:45.389
Cybil reached out.
There's a board meeting later today.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.932
Of course, she called you and not me.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.976
I'll speak to the talent.
If you need to reach me...

21:48.976 --> 21:50.477
- I'll send a carrier pigeon.
- Yep.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.149
The FCC's been calling.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.163
Ask me about my day.

22:10.956 --> 22:12.207
<i>How was work, dear?</i>

22:13.375 --> 22:16.003
Yeah, about that...

22:16.003 --> 22:18.755
So you fuck with my rocket,
and then you get taken off the air?

22:18.755 --> 22:21.508
That feels like cosmic justice to me.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.012
<i>Karma's overrated.
I'm more of a chaos theory kinda guy.</i>

22:25.512 --> 22:27.306
So what do you think,
this was some kinda hack?

22:27.306 --> 22:29.141
Yeah, something like that.

22:29.141 --> 22:30.559
<i>Any idea who's behind it?</i>

22:30.559 --> 22:33.395
Well, you're the cybersecurity genius.
Why don't you tell me?

22:33.395 --> 22:35.189
What, do you think I did it?

22:36.440 --> 22:39.193
To hold my network hostage
until I meet your price?

22:41.403 --> 22:42.404
Nah.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.908
- How much do they want?
- <i>Fifty.</i>

22:47.034 --> 22:48.118
What did you go back at?

22:50.495 --> 22:53.665
Come on. At least just don't tell me
you're paying sticker price here.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.417
No, of course not.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.378
Would you at least tell Alex
she missed a beautiful flight?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.256
Why don't you tell her yourself, sweetheart?

23:02.841 --> 23:03.842
Get me Victor.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.511
On it.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.140
Hi. Thank you.

23:10.641 --> 23:12.726
We need you all to surrender your devices.

23:12.726 --> 23:15.229
Laptops, phones, tablets, smart watches.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.147
- What?
- Put everything in the bags

23:17.147 --> 23:19.650
- and take them to the fly team.
- You're kidding, right?

23:19.650 --> 23:22.152
Because it's now evidence of a crime.

23:22.152 --> 23:24.071
Replacements will be issued on Monday.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.155
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:25.155 --> 23:26.657
So we're not getting our phones back,
like, ever?

23:26.657 --> 23:30.202
Anything that accessed UBA's
secure network is probably compromised.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.412
We're a news organization running 24-7.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.373
How are we supposed to work
without our cell phones, laptops?

23:34.373 --> 23:35.916
We're just gonna give our shit
to those guys?

23:35.916 --> 23:38.085
- They're gonna look through our shit?
- Half my staff is still remote.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.878
What do they have, like, texts,
emails, photos?

23:39.878 --> 23:42.130
- What do they have?
- We don't know what they have,

23:42.130 --> 23:44.883
but we'll have more information
in the coming days.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.302
I know you're all probably
concerned with your private data.

23:47.302 --> 23:51.598
UBA is committed to protecting
all employees from any kind of exposure.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.310
- Right. You're all protected.
- Fuck.

23:55.310 --> 23:58.272
- Thank you. We're gonna get through this.
- Can you pass me a Sharpie?

23:58.272 --> 24:00.774
My daughter's wedding pictures
are on my phone.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.192
It'll be on the cloud. You're fine.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.278
I'm not on the cloud, Yanko.

24:04.278 --> 24:07.114
- My husband's cell.
- Devices in the bags.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.156
What?

24:08.156 --> 24:09.658
Alex, is there a problem?

24:09.658 --> 24:12.077
No.
All my shit's already aired to the world,

24:12.077 --> 24:13.620
- so I'm good.
- This conversation isn't over yet.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.038
- Okay.
- Alex.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.916
You blew off
an incredibly important live broadcast

24:17.916 --> 24:20.294
that took us months to set up and promote.

24:21.044 --> 24:24.423
I'm putting you on <i>TMS</i> five days a week
until after upfronts.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.469
Okay. Yeah.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.763
I'm happy to pull out
a copy of my contract

24:31.763 --> 24:33.640
if you don't remember my deal points.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.810
Respectfully, Alex,
actions have consequences, even for you.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.022
Does Cybil know about this?

24:40.022 --> 24:42.149
Yeah. She and Cory both signed off.

24:43.692 --> 24:46.403
Okay. I see.

24:46.403 --> 24:51.116
So you're putting Bad Alex
in a little <i>TMS</i> time-out?

24:51.116 --> 24:52.242
Is that what's happening?

24:52.951 --> 24:57.623
No, it's not. It's not gonna happen,
all right? Doug will be all over this.

24:57.623 --> 24:59.833
I'll be happy to show him
how you breached your contract.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.586
<i>TMS</i>, five times a week.
Thank you for being a team player.

25:02.586 --> 25:05.756
Wow. Oh, my God. Just fuck off, Stella.

25:05.756 --> 25:06.924
Just fuck off.

25:45.921 --> 25:47.005
Thought you'd forgotten about me.

25:47.965 --> 25:49.383
<i>You know I wouldn't do that.</i>

25:51.426 --> 25:53.428
What's wrong? Something's up.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.891
Our system has been compromised.
Some kind of a cyberattack.

25:57.891 --> 26:00.561
Shit. You think it's Russia?

26:00.561 --> 26:04.398
Who knows? But back up all your files.
Don't email any UBA accounts.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.860
Got it. I'll figure something out
if anything comes up.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.826
Are you still in Kyiv?
Wait, don't tell me. This line isn't safe.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.287
<i>Let's just say I'm still in the shit.</i>

26:18.912 --> 26:20.622
Trying to lay low for a moment.

26:21.665 --> 26:23.750
<i>It's ugly, but I'm glad I'm here.</i>

26:24.960 --> 26:26.920
Yeah. Just one second, please.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.298
They're about to confiscate my phone.

26:29.298 --> 26:33.510
You're telling me a badass,
world-traveling executive producer

26:33.510 --> 26:35.262
can't find her way to a burner phone?

26:36.763 --> 26:39.892
Am I a badass,
world-traveling executive producer?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.019
Fuck yeah.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.856
Then I guess I'll figure it out.

26:50.569 --> 26:53.447
Okay, I gotta go. Stay safe.

26:55.657 --> 26:56.658
Bye, Mia.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.286
Bye.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.918
- It's Cory.
- Yeah, come in.

27:07.586 --> 27:08.712
Hey.

27:08.712 --> 27:11.006
- You want it open or closed?
- Closed.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.591
Okay.

27:15.761 --> 27:17.179
Your devices?

27:18.472 --> 27:20.724
They're there with the cyber guys.

27:22.434 --> 27:25.646
You wanted a word?

27:27.189 --> 27:28.190
Yeah.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.660
Hey, I can have a hundred deepfakes
on the web by tonight.

27:39.660 --> 27:42.538
- Messy, amateur. No one will even look--
- Cory--

27:42.538 --> 27:43.997
Or we can go on the attack.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.709
Any site that wants to host your video,
we'll do a denial of service.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.045
No, that's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

27:53.131 --> 27:58.428
I was thinking about last year.

28:08.647 --> 28:09.648
Yeah.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.695
Did you ever tell anybody?

28:18.448 --> 28:19.449
No.

28:20.993 --> 28:22.119
Are you sure?

28:24.538 --> 28:28.292
I am sure. Are you?

28:30.127 --> 28:34.381
Yeah, I'm sure.
I mean, I'm as sure as I can be.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.466
I didn't--

28:39.887 --> 28:40.971
I didn't expect this.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.394
You should pay the ransom.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.062
I'm working on it.

28:49.563 --> 28:53.025
But it's up to the board, and I'm not
exactly in Cybil's good graces right now.

28:55.611 --> 28:57.571
You have to pay the ransom.

29:01.533 --> 29:02.659
I'm terrified.

29:17.508 --> 29:20.302
I need that damage report.
I asked for it an hour ago.

29:20.302 --> 29:22.554
- Oh, my God. I need to talk to you.
- Get in line.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.932
W-- No, well, there's something
that might come out about me and--

29:24.932 --> 29:26.391
That you had a matchmaker?

29:26.391 --> 29:27.643
What? How'd you know that?

29:27.643 --> 29:30.938
- You told Donny, and Donny told everyone.
- Fucking Donny.

29:31.522 --> 29:33.941
Give us a minute.
You have 60 seconds. What?

29:35.234 --> 29:37.152
- I--
- Yes?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.612
- I have certain preferences...
- Uh-huh.

29:38.612 --> 29:39.821
...okay, that if they come to light,

29:39.821 --> 29:42.824
it might compromise
my ability to anchor here at <i>TMS</i>.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.035
Yeah, okay, so you can't report
on the housing market

29:45.035 --> 29:46.703
because you're into what, strap-ons?

29:46.703 --> 29:48.914
- No, it's not strap-ons.
- Yanko, I don't care.

29:49.414 --> 29:50.874
Okay. And also, I have, like--

29:50.874 --> 29:53.585
I have a little running thing
with some of the other anchors about you.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.087
It's just, like, a little joke.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.548
Okay, go on.

29:58.674 --> 30:01.176
Sorry, I called you CBS.

30:01.176 --> 30:03.846
CBS. You mean I'm too network?

30:05.055 --> 30:07.307
It stands for "child bride of Satan."

30:07.307 --> 30:09.476
This was after you suspended me.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.401
Did the C really stand for "child"?

30:19.027 --> 30:20.571
- No.
- I appreciate your candor.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.239
Okay. Thank you. Sorry again.

30:23.448 --> 30:25.117
This is such bullshit.

30:25.742 --> 30:29.079
- I'm not gonna do five days on <i>TMS</i>.
<i>- Alex, I know, but my hands are tied.</i>

30:29.079 --> 30:30.706
Oh, my God. What the actual fuck, Doug?

30:30.706 --> 30:32.541
- You said you were going to fix this and--
- Hey.

30:33.792 --> 30:34.877
Can I come in?

30:34.877 --> 30:36.253
Yes, come in.

30:36.253 --> 30:37.462
You know what I'd like you to do?

30:37.462 --> 30:39.590
I would like you to read my contract again

30:39.590 --> 30:42.634
and keep reading it
until you find a way to fix this shit.

30:42.634 --> 30:43.552
<i>All right--</i>

30:43.552 --> 30:45.262
Wow. Are you okay?

30:46.805 --> 30:47.806
I'm great.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.268
Okay. Listen, I need your help.

30:51.935 --> 30:52.811
Why? You okay?

30:52.811 --> 30:55.314
Yeah, Stella isn't telling everybody
the whole story.

30:55.314 --> 30:58.317
The hackers sent a ransom demand
for $50 million.

31:01.987 --> 31:04.448
Yeah. And the board is meeting right now.

31:04.448 --> 31:06.074
And I need you to talk to Cybil,

31:06.074 --> 31:08.493
and I need you to just tell her
she's got to pay it.

31:08.493 --> 31:11.830
I'm not going anywhere near Cybil,
as she won't be listening to me.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.291
What are you talking about?
You've been here for 20 years.

31:14.291 --> 31:18.045
You're the biggest star on this network.
If you talk to the board,

31:18.045 --> 31:20.631
- they're going to listen to you.
- No, they're not gonna listen to me.

31:20.631 --> 31:21.590
Trust me.

31:21.590 --> 31:27.429
Cory and Stella just kneecapped me
for ditching <i>Hyperion One</i>. Okay?

31:27.930 --> 31:29.515
No one's listening to me.

31:29.515 --> 31:32.976
Well, I mean, we have to do something.
This is bad.

31:32.976 --> 31:35.562
No, I'm staying out of it.
UBA did not protect my privacy

31:35.562 --> 31:37.898
when Maggie Brener
aired all my shit to the world.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.316
You know, this isn't just about you.

31:39.316 --> 31:41.443
There's other people here
that are really scared.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.237
Okay. You know what? You're gonna be fine.

31:43.237 --> 31:44.947
You're like a Girl Scout, okay?

31:45.697 --> 31:48.408
And honestly, let it all come out.
I don't give a shit.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.494
Let all the secrets,
the corporate bullshit.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.329
I'm so-- Fuck this place.

31:52.913 --> 31:55.040
There's a lot of people
around here that have stuff

31:55.040 --> 31:57.918
- that they want to keep private.
- Wait, did you fuck a predator?

32:00.379 --> 32:03.924
No, you didn't.
I think if-- I think you're gonna be fine.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.802
This whole place is gonna be fine.

32:08.303 --> 32:12.182
You know,
UBA didn't protect you, but I did.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.103
Oh, God. I know you did, Bradley.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.939
- Bradley, come on.
- Forget it.

32:20.858 --> 32:21.859
I didn't--

32:24.403 --> 32:29.199
Okay, so I'd like to paint a picture of
what we're about to face, actually.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.827
You have to think the Fukushima tsunami
is headed our way,

32:31.827 --> 32:33.537
and it's already radioactive.

32:33.537 --> 32:39.585
Because when news of the hack comes out,
our stock is gonna drop 15%.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.004
Carl Icahn is going to call you.
Do not pick up.

32:42.004 --> 32:44.464
When he sends you a fruit basket,
do not bite into the apple.

32:44.464 --> 32:47.092
People are going to quit, and we're not
gonna be able to replace them.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.969
Departments will be short-staffed,

32:48.969 --> 32:53.724
and the ones that stay
will be overworked, and angry and scared.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.894
Actors, directors, producers,
they're gonna refuse to work with us.

32:56.894 --> 33:00.522
The ones that do, they're gonna break
deal precedence and squeeze us for points.

33:00.522 --> 33:02.065
And if we're lucky,

33:02.065 --> 33:07.279
we will face a single class action lawsuit
from our employees for negligence.

33:07.279 --> 33:10.824
And so far, folks, good folks,
gentlefolks, we've not been so lucky.

33:10.824 --> 33:14.870
Also, all of our internal communications
will be made public.

33:16.413 --> 33:19.416
The way we do business.
Our plans for the future.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.710
It will be back to go,

33:22.294 --> 33:27.549
and believe me,
we will not collect two-- $200.

33:27.549 --> 33:30.969
This hack, it is nuclear.

33:32.513 --> 33:36.183
Yes. What do you suggest we do?

33:38.477 --> 33:39.311
Pay the ransom.

33:39.978 --> 33:43.649
We have no guarantee they'll stick
to their side of the bargain.

33:43.649 --> 33:47.027
- Fifty million? That's ridiculous.
- The insurance will cover part of it,

33:47.027 --> 33:49.112
and there's something else.
We've made contact.

33:50.239 --> 33:53.408
I think I can negotiate them down
to 25 million, maybe less.

33:54.409 --> 33:57.704
- Would our cash reserves cover that?
- Wouldn't that be nice.

33:57.704 --> 34:00.290
Those reserves were plundered
to fund UBA+.

34:01.416 --> 34:04.503
Is there any unreleased material?

34:04.503 --> 34:06.547
They've got some pilots
and the Chris Pine thriller.

34:06.547 --> 34:08.757
How much do we lose if that gets leaked?

34:08.757 --> 34:13.344
Estimate is a quarter of
their projected box office, so 60 million.

34:13.344 --> 34:16.014
What about UBA+ subscriber data?

34:16.014 --> 34:17.391
We use a third-party vendor.

34:17.391 --> 34:19.226
What exactly are we paying for?

34:19.726 --> 34:25.065
A summer movie which may or may not hit,
some stock turbulence, a few resignations.

34:25.065 --> 34:29.444
How about the goodwill
and the dignity of our employees,

34:29.444 --> 34:31.780
not to mention the company brand.

34:31.780 --> 34:34.699
The hackers specifically targeted

34:34.699 --> 34:39.955
the private communications of
Bradley Jackson, our evening news anchor.

34:39.955 --> 34:42.791
She just won a First Amendment Award.
She's up for a Peabody.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.501
Then she should have known better

34:44.501 --> 34:48.005
than to make herself vulnerable
to attacks of this kind.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.925
Why would we hand over millions

34:51.925 --> 34:54.887
to the criminals
who just broke into our house

34:55.679 --> 35:00.142
when we can spend a fraction of that to
make ourself safe against future attacks?

35:00.142 --> 35:03.270
I agree, but I think we can do both.

35:04.062 --> 35:05.898
Then there's the issue of the money.

35:05.898 --> 35:08.567
Can we assume these hackers are Russian?

35:09.985 --> 35:14.531
The signature of the hack suggests that.

35:14.531 --> 35:16.283
- Yes, but--
- Yeah, well, we already know

35:16.283 --> 35:20.871
that Putin sanctions cyberattacks
against Western news outlets.

35:22.664 --> 35:25.751
So we may be contributing
to Russia's war against Ukraine.

35:26.877 --> 35:30.214
I don't want that on my conscience.

35:31.381 --> 35:34.968
And I can't imagine any of
our advertising partners would either.

35:34.968 --> 35:37.012
I certainly don't.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.890
Look, I think we should move to a vote.

35:41.099 --> 35:44.269
All those in favor of paying the ransom
say "aye."

35:46.021 --> 35:47.314
Those opposed.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.526
Nay.

35:53.779 --> 35:54.780
Good.

35:54.780 --> 35:59.117
Leonard, dear, would you connect
with our institutional investors?

36:00.244 --> 36:03.288
Mercedes, would you please reach out
to those majority shareholders

36:03.288 --> 36:04.915
who weren't able to join us today?

36:05.916 --> 36:09.086
Let's send a clear message.

36:09.086 --> 36:15.759
UBA is standing strong
and refusing to negotiate with terrorists.

36:16.844 --> 36:20.556
Anyone needs hand-holding,
send them to me.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.725
Thus spake the Iron Lady.

36:23.725 --> 36:24.810
Leonard.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.858
- Tell them who's driving, in some ways.
- Yes.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.609
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Hey.

36:33.819 --> 36:34.862
Well, it was--

36:35.821 --> 36:38.657
I sure hope everyone here is comfortable

36:38.657 --> 36:41.910
with their private communications
going very public.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.538
I think we'll weather the storm.

36:44.538 --> 36:47.666
I have to say it was refreshing
to get stabbed in the stomach

36:47.666 --> 36:49.334
instead of the back, so thanks.

36:50.002 --> 36:53.297
Perhaps your friend Paul Marks
can help stitch up the wound.

36:53.881 --> 36:55.007
For future reference,

36:55.007 --> 37:00.304
all merger and acquisition offers
run through the board, of course.

37:00.304 --> 37:03.140
But I wouldn't worry about that for now.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.975
I'm sure you'll have your hands full

37:04.975 --> 37:08.604
proving to our shareholders
that you can still run this company.

37:09.688 --> 37:16.069
Well, I will be fully embracing
UBA's new era of radical transparency.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.614
Everything that ever was and will be,
out in the open.

37:18.614 --> 37:19.907
I think it's gonna be fun.

37:19.907 --> 37:22.201
Privacy. Come on. That's so 20th century.

37:22.201 --> 37:25.454
You just don't ever stop spinning, do you?

37:25.454 --> 37:29.291
You are CEO because you staged a coup.

37:29.291 --> 37:33.462
That's not leadership. That's opportunism.

37:34.296 --> 37:37.841
You walk through these halls
with this unswerving belief

37:37.841 --> 37:40.594
that you, and you alone, can fix it.

37:40.594 --> 37:45.557
I've seen quite a few men come to this
company with that same God complex.

37:46.475 --> 37:50.437
Eventually, you all fail.

38:01.782 --> 38:03.867
People are gonna talk so much shit.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.077
So what?

38:05.077 --> 38:06.954
I mean, they already think I'm a joke.

38:06.954 --> 38:09.540
Director of Development?
What is that even?

38:10.082 --> 38:11.834
You're taking pitches on scripted.

38:11.834 --> 38:14.002
You're-- Got a raise, you know.
It's legit.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.004
Yeah, well, people take you seriously.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.715
Well, they take Alex seriously.

38:18.715 --> 38:20.801
You have an Emmy. It has your name on it.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.057
We should tell her, right?
I mean, she's gonna find out.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.352
Yeah. Probably, yeah.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.730
So everything's gonna change, you know.

38:36.650 --> 38:37.651
You scared?

38:39.361 --> 38:40.612
I mean, yeah, a little.

38:41.697 --> 38:46.493
But... you're worth it.

38:49.371 --> 38:50.664
- You ruined it.
- Nah.

38:52.416 --> 38:54.751
<i>So I just had a call
with the president of NBN,</i>

38:54.751 --> 38:57.462
and they're going to release
the hacking story in the morning.

38:57.963 --> 38:58.839
I can't blame them

38:58.839 --> 39:00.382
- with Laura wrapped up in this...
- Yeah.

39:00.382 --> 39:03.218
...but it means that
we have to break the news tonight.

39:04.011 --> 39:07.556
And once that ransom deadline passes,
they may release the data that they have.

39:07.556 --> 39:09.975
Which means your video-- your-- Could--

39:09.975 --> 39:10.893
I understand.

39:10.893 --> 39:14.021
Hey. Do you want maybe
one of the weekend anchors to sit in

39:14.021 --> 39:15.439
if you need to take the time?

39:15.439 --> 39:18.483
No, it's my chair. I'll do it.

39:18.483 --> 39:19.568
Okay.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.361
Okay.

39:40.756 --> 39:41.757
Oh, God.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.218
Oh, God.

39:45.886 --> 39:49.306
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

39:49.932 --> 39:51.850
S-- we can explain.

39:52.559 --> 39:53.936
Chip, shut up.

39:54.561 --> 39:55.395
Oh, my God.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.898
Have you learned nothing from Mitch?

39:58.482 --> 39:59.942
Oh, my God. Okay. Isabella.

39:59.942 --> 40:02.236
Isabella, you just--
You just tell me honestly.

40:02.236 --> 40:03.570
No one's in trouble.

40:03.570 --> 40:04.988
- Did he pressure you in any way?
- No.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.281
- What?
- No, of course not.

40:06.281 --> 40:09.034
Really? You think I would pressure her
after everything that happened?

40:09.034 --> 40:10.786
- Jesus.
- I don't know what the fuck to think!

40:10.786 --> 40:12.829
I just walked in on you
fucking my assistant.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.540
- We were not fu-- Yeah.
- Director of Development!

40:14.540 --> 40:16.750
- See?
- Oh, my God.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.836
- All right. We're coming out.
- Oh, God.

40:19.336 --> 40:23.257
- We're coming out, okay? Okay.
- Oh, God. Okay, okay.

40:23.257 --> 40:24.758
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my gosh.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.469
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

40:27.469 --> 40:31.181
So how long has this been happening?

40:31.890 --> 40:32.975
- We-- Look...
- Oh, God!

40:32.975 --> 40:35.769
- ...we told HR a few months ago.
- A few months?

40:35.769 --> 40:37.980
We just didn't know how to tell you.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.357
We've been together for almost a year.

40:41.775 --> 40:42.693
Almost a year?

40:44.194 --> 40:45.404
- A year?
- Yeah.

40:47.739 --> 40:50.450
Oh, my gosh! This is gonna be great
for my trust issues.

40:52.452 --> 40:54.204
I need a drink. Oh, God.

40:54.204 --> 40:55.664
- I got this.
- I'm gonna go.

40:55.664 --> 40:57.249
- I'm gonna go.
- No. Come on.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.669
No, it's okay.

41:08.135 --> 41:11.221
Hi. Just so you know,
this was not planned.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.599
This was almost an accident really.

41:14.850 --> 41:16.143
- Okay. Well...
- I mean--

41:17.519 --> 41:20.439
...I'm really-- I'm actually
really happy for you.

41:20.439 --> 41:21.732
But nothing's gonna change.

41:21.732 --> 41:23.692
- Like, we're still a team.
- The three of us. Just us.

41:23.692 --> 41:26.153
- Still your people.
- No. I'm honestly-- It's good.

41:26.153 --> 41:27.696
I'm okay. Really.

41:27.696 --> 41:31.783
I mean, the world's just been so fucked-up
the last couple years.

41:31.783 --> 41:33.118
- Yeah.
- I mean,

41:33.118 --> 41:35.829
you just gotta grab love
where you can find it, right?

41:35.829 --> 41:38.165
- Yeah. Yeah?
- And that's what this is.

41:38.165 --> 41:42.669
It's beautiful. It's just-- It's amazing.

41:42.669 --> 41:46.089
It's just, you know, amazing.

41:46.089 --> 41:47.174
Thanks.

41:47.174 --> 41:48.300
Yeah.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.970
Let's hug it in, you lovers.
Come on, seriously.

41:51.970 --> 41:56.934
Oh, Isabella. Chipper. Oh, guys.
You know what?

41:56.934 --> 41:58.644
We should go to dinner.
We should celebrate.

41:58.644 --> 42:00.062
We should order a big bottle of champagne.

42:00.062 --> 42:01.772
- Yeah. Okay--
- Maybe not tonight.

42:02.481 --> 42:04.733
- We don't have to tonight.
- No, we'll rain check it.

42:04.733 --> 42:06.360
- Okay. Yes. Yes, of course...
- Totally.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.528
- ...but I wanna do it.
- Okay.

42:07.528 --> 42:09.196
- We should go now.
- Okay.

42:09.196 --> 42:13.992
- Yes, we packed up all your devices, so...
- Yes.

42:13.992 --> 42:15.827
- The Lizzy. Thank you.
- Yes, all that stuff.

42:15.827 --> 42:17.538
- I don't have to think about that now.
- And--

42:17.538 --> 42:19.039
- Yeah.
- So that's good.

42:19.039 --> 42:20.499
And if you need anything
obviously you just...

42:20.499 --> 42:21.583
- Just call.
- Of course.

42:21.583 --> 42:22.876
- ...you call us.
- I'm not kidding.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.462
Seriously, I'm so happy for you.

42:25.462 --> 42:26.922
- I really am.
- Thank you.

42:26.922 --> 42:28.382
- This is beautiful.
- Okay.

42:28.382 --> 42:30.509
- Great.
- Just-- Yay love.

42:31.885 --> 42:32.886
Oh, boy.

42:33.762 --> 42:34.596
Oh, God.

42:35.514 --> 42:37.057
What the hell just happened?

42:40.352 --> 42:41.353
Oh, my God.

42:43.063 --> 42:44.064
Oh, my God.

42:45.524 --> 42:48.026
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

43:04.126 --> 43:08.881
Earlier today, we learned that UBA
has been the target of a cyberattack.

43:09.882 --> 43:12.176
Multiple live transmissions were impacted,

43:12.176 --> 43:15.554
and we are still learning
the scope of the breach.

43:15.554 --> 43:20.976
<i>Here at UBA, we pride ourselves on being
transparent with all of our viewers.</i>

43:20.976 --> 43:22.769
<i>We consider you part of our family.</i>

43:23.270 --> 43:28.150
<i>Which is why I need to let you know
that certain things may come to light,</i>

43:28.150 --> 43:31.737
<i>personal things
that were never meant to be shared.</i>

43:32.487 --> 43:35.407
<i>While all of our lives
are increasingly public,</i>

43:35.407 --> 43:38.160
<i>each of us has the right to our privacy.</i>

43:38.160 --> 43:42.873
<i>And this network will continue fighting
for that right, no matter the cost.</i>

43:43.749 --> 43:48.212
<i>UBA has made a decision not to pay
the ransom demanded by the individuals</i>

43:48.212 --> 43:52.633
<i>who have stolen the private data of
thousands of dedicated employees.</i>

43:53.550 --> 43:55.219
In this era of misinformation,

43:55.219 --> 43:58.597
where journalists are intimidated
on a daily basis,

43:59.264 --> 44:02.017
where truth is increasingly politicized,

44:02.518 --> 44:07.814
UBA will not give in to blackmail
just to save face.

44:08.815 --> 44:12.819
Because once we lose your trust,
there's no going back.

44:14.238 --> 44:17.199
We will continue to update you
as this story unfolds.

44:18.617 --> 44:19.618
And we're out.

44:26.333 --> 44:27.334
Isn't this nice?

44:28.961 --> 44:31.630
No phones or computers to distract us.

44:31.630 --> 44:34.216
Just kick back, relax and converse.

44:34.216 --> 44:37.719
Like a couple of prehistoric men
in a dark cave.

44:38.345 --> 44:40.180
The embers of the fire warming us.

44:41.265 --> 44:43.934
Listening to the mournful cries
of a woolly mammoth.

44:47.521 --> 44:49.606
It's not even Cybil's money.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.817
Who doesn't like
spending other people's money?

44:51.817 --> 44:53.402
Most companies don't pay.

44:54.987 --> 44:58.156
Okay. Did she give you that cockroach
speech? She gives it to everyone.

44:58.156 --> 45:00.158
It's like it's on her fucking family's
coat of arms.

45:00.158 --> 45:02.452
- Yes.
- Yeah. She did. A couple of times.

45:06.164 --> 45:09.835
Look, you do things your way.
I respect that.

45:09.835 --> 45:13.338
And I don't expect to be
looped into every meeting.

45:13.338 --> 45:16.300
But these tech guys,
they're a different beast.

45:17.176 --> 45:18.177
I know.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.429
I'm just saying. I'm from that world.

45:20.429 --> 45:22.556
Paul Marks, he's tricky.

45:25.184 --> 45:28.478
So if you're going to war, make sure
you're not fighting it on two fronts.

45:32.858 --> 45:36.862
I gotta prep for tomorrow.
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

45:36.862 --> 45:38.197
Yeah.

45:43.535 --> 45:45.746
It'll probably come out in my emails.

45:49.082 --> 45:51.126
I was dating Blake Griffin last year.

45:54.087 --> 45:55.589
Wouldn't have guessed he's your type.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.841
He wasn't.

45:58.884 --> 46:00.552
Anything of yours gonna come out?

46:02.429 --> 46:03.430
Guess we'll see.

46:04.723 --> 46:07.184
Knowing you,
it'll probably help your cause.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.791
<i>Hello?</i>

46:30.791 --> 46:32.501
- Earl?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

46:33.377 --> 46:38.423
Let's work up a document with deal points
for a merger with Paul Marks.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.383
<i>Okay.</i>

46:39.383 --> 46:42.553
Viable numbers, timeline,
profit projections.

46:43.053 --> 46:46.431
And leak it early tomorrow
and let the street lap it up.

46:47.432 --> 46:48.559
<i>I'm on it.</i>

47:24.887 --> 47:26.346
- Hi.
- Hey.

47:26.346 --> 47:27.890
Laura called me.

47:29.683 --> 47:32.019
Why did you not tell me about the video?

47:32.019 --> 47:33.896
I'm sorry, did you fuck a predator?

47:34.855 --> 47:37.608
- Yeah, not my finest moment.
- You were kind of being an asshole.

47:37.608 --> 47:39.026
I was such an asshole.

47:39.026 --> 47:40.485
Just so much going on.

47:41.820 --> 47:44.198
Honey, crisis management is my specialty.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.408
Let me help you through this.

47:47.701 --> 47:49.953
- I don't know what I'm gonna do. Okay.
- We're gonna be okay.

47:49.953 --> 47:51.747
- We've got this.
- Thank you.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.335
Yeah?

47:56.335 --> 47:59.505
- You're good to go.
- Thank you.
