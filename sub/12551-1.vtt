They drop into
the sea or they burn up.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.368
We guide them
into the sea, Clyde.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.870
I think Kaagh is planning
something much more dramatic.

25:38.937 --> 25:43.808
My scans detect more than
3,000 satellites
orbiting your planet.

25:43.875 --> 25:48.113
Your primitive, but deadly,
nuclear reactors on Earth

25:48.179 --> 25:49.981
will make effective targets.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.685
It'll trigger
a nuclear chain reaction
that'll wipe out all life.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.022
And I shall return to Sontar
as the avenging hero.

25:57.088 --> 25:59.858
My name shall be purged
of the shame of defeat,

25:59.925 --> 26:03.161
it will echo through the Halls
of the Fallen and the Brave.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.463
Sontar-ha!

26:05.530 --> 26:06.865
And when does this happen?

26:08.667 --> 26:10.502
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

26:10.568 --> 26:13.872
KAAGH: When they're in the
primary position of alignment,

26:13.939 --> 26:16.074
a signal from
the telescope antenna

26:16.141 --> 26:19.945
will bounce across the
satellite network and
trigger their fall,

26:21.313 --> 26:22.847
in 45 minutes.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.888
(ALARM SOUNDING)

26:31.456 --> 26:34.559
CLYDE: Forget it.
It's not going to happen.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.628
We've seen off
all sorts of aliens.

26:36.695 --> 26:40.865
No way is Earth going to go
down to the Baked Spud
from outer space!

26:42.167 --> 26:46.471
Your defiance is good,
half-form.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.139
We have to do something.

26:48.206 --> 26:52.143
Our battle intelligence
on semi-developed
organisms is incomplete.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.946
The countdown
will give me time
to expand it

26:55.013 --> 26:57.549
with the experiments
I shall perform

26:58.316 --> 27:00.285
on you.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.520
Don't you lay a finger on him!
I won't let you.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.889
Defiance will be eliminated!

27:09.494 --> 27:11.196
14 minutes, Clyde.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.631
(KAAGH YELLING)

27:13.698 --> 27:15.367
Dad, you have to help us.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.606
Alan, what's going on?

27:21.673 --> 27:23.608
(ALARM SOUNDING)

27:23.675 --> 27:25.210
Intruders on my ship?

27:25.276 --> 27:27.078
My dad's got a job in America.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.280
Are you going with him?

27:29.347 --> 27:32.017
I will crush you with
my bare hands, Bitesize!
