my best friend,
the six-string slayer, Otis!

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.083
Woo-hoo!

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.333

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm a donkey.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
Okay. I thought he'd say
a little more than that.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.791
Now finally, on lead vocals,

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.041
the pony with soul is me, Thelma.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.916
And we are The Rusty Buckets!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.916
Hey, Otis, do you know what time it is?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.208
Oh, I know what time it is.

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.583
Thelma, do you know what time it is?

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.875

We need softer hay.

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.958
Oho! That was sick!

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.833
Yeah, you got, like,
three feet of air that time.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:53.166
Well, I hope the judges like it.
I just busted my tailbone, dude.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.416
Can I be real with you guys?
I don't think it's gonna be enough.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.333
Okay.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.500
If we really wanna
kill this audition tomorrow,

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.958
we're gonna need some pyrotechnics.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.875

Hey, Bessie.
I thought you had the week off.

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:38.166
Nope. People gotta have their cheese.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.333
Girl, you crack me up,
getting all that overtime.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:42.708
I hear you. I see you.

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:43.791

So you ready for the big audition tonight?

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:53.208
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do the dang thing.

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.625
We've been trying
to hit it big for way too long.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.833
Oh, come on. It hasn't been that long.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.500
It's been ten years.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.916
Don't you finally wanna play
somewhere that matters?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.083
I'm happy playing music anywhere,
as long as it's with you.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.541
Thelma, watch out!

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:09.958
Whoa!

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.083
You trying to kill me, Reggie?
You need to cut them bangs, son.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.250
My bad.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.291
Aw, dang it. Not again.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.250
Hey. So, uh,
how are those new lyrics coming along?

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.083
What lyrics?

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:30.208
You know, the lyrics for the one song
you don't have lyrics for.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.291
Come on, Otis.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:33.458
That thing has stumped me
since I was a kid.

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.301
And now, the world premiere

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.541

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.166
"Blubber Trouble."

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.250
You've gotta see this.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.791

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.541
No way. Nikki's such a sellout.
She's as fake as it gets.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:19.333
Who cares? That girl gets to sing
at SparklePalooza every year.

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:22.000
That'll be us someday. I just know it.

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:23.833

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:26.083
Yeah, what do you want?

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.541
This manure isn't gonna move itself.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.583
Yeah, Thelma. I can't work like this.

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.541
Yeah, I got you. I'm coming.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:38.801
Come on, Thelma,
give us that manure.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:39.875
We're starving.

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.000
{\an8}Y'all better not be laying eggs
in my hair.

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.333
She's a fly eater! Get him out!

I was in her brain!
I was in her brain!

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.875
- I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh no.

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958
Please don't see me.
Please don't see me. Please...

done fell right on her.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.958
Thelma, is this your routine
for the audition tonight?

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.291
No, Zirconia.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.583
You know I'm singing.

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:13.708
You gotta be joking.

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:17.125
Ain't nobody on earth wanna
hear music from a plain old farm pony.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.583
You look disgusting.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:23.333
Girl, we have the looks and the talent.

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:25.375
And you got nothing.

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.125
- Ew! What you doing?
- Hey!

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:31.750
At least I don't have crusty old pink eye.

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:35.541
What? Esteban, is she for real?
Do I have pink eye?

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.541
Yeah, I think you do.

or is it reality?

Whoo! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:38.416
Otis, I'm so nervous I feel like
my heart's gonna drop out of my butt.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.375
That's scientifically impossible.

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:42.541
- No, really, I can feel it.
- Hello!

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.916
Next up on our talent search tonight,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.375
an original song performed by, uh...

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.000
The Rusty Buckets?

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:09.666
You got this.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.291
Whoo.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:18.833
Hey, everybody.

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.101
We're The Rusty Buckets,
and... and we're really excited...

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:22.291
{\an8}Next!

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:24.750
Wait, wait. What?

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:26.291
{\an8}Off the stage, please.

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:29.291
But we didn't even get
a chance to perform our song.

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.791
{\an8}I'm sorry, kid. There's no future here.
Okay? Keep it moving.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:34.416
Hold up.
We've waited years for this opportunity.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.833
{\an8}What's not working for you?

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:39.208
{\an8}Look, babe, you just don't have "it."

00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:42.083
"It"? What do you mean?

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.833
We just want people with a certain look.

00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:47.791
Someone that sparkles
and lights up the stage,

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.291
not some forgettable farm pony.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:51.291
What?

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:55.791
{\an8}Yo, yo, you gotta be something special
to perform at SparklePalooza.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.416
{\an8}I'm sorry,
but you will never perform there.

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:02.916
Now, you listen here, buddy... Whoa!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.625
- Oh!
- Whoa.

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:18.708
Thelma!

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:27.125
You'll never perform there.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.083
Now, you listen here, buddy...
Whoa!

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:35.375
Never gonna happen!

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:42.083
Good evening, fair maiden.
Why the long face?

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:45.333
I have come from afar to cheer thee up.

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:47.583
Wilt thou join me on a quest?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.375
Sure.

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:54.958
Let me transport you
to a realm of goblins, sorcery,

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:59.583
and 19th-century homesteaders
on the Oregon Trail.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:09.041
{\an8}It's a completely original
role-playing game I've been developing.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:12.250
{\an8}I call it Dungeons and Wagons.

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.333
What?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.833
Mmm!

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:20.500
My character is
a donkey warlord named Donk-Truvious.

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:24.541
Check it out. He's got a fake nipple
that doubles as a ninja star.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:25.976
Whoops.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.583
- Donk who?
- Here, this is your character.

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:32.041
She's a hardened pioneer pony
who dabbles in martial arts.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:35.416
She also just beat cholera,
so she has super high stamina points.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.458
- What do you wanna call her?
- Horse Lady?

00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.625
Come on, you can do better than that.

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:43.666
Okay, fine. Then Sad Horse Lady.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.333
- What? That's weak.
- Why can't I just be this unicorn?

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.958
Oh, sorry, everyone wants to be her.

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:51.791
She's a level 300 cleric.

00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:55.708
{\an8}You can only unlock her after you sell
your soul to a shape-shifter warlock.

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.375
Okay, okay, so our wagon train

00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:59.791
has just been attacked
by a horde of goblins,

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.125
and we are the only survivors.

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.125
I'm sorry, Otis.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:05.541
This game is really great,

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:08.250
but I'm just too bummed out
to play it right now.

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:11.958
Hey, don't worry about
what happened tonight.

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:15.333
Pfft! Yeah, right.
You heard what those judges said.

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:17.166
It's never gonna happen for us.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.750
No way, Thelma.
We're just getting started.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.791
We'll have plenty of other chances.

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.083
No.

00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:26.083
Everyone's always told me
I didn't have the right looks for this.

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.375
And you know what? I think they're right.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:31.416
Well, I think you're perfect.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.625
Good night, Thelma.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.458
Yay, breakfast!

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:04.708
- Group photo, everyone.
- We did it.

00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:07.500
Rhinestone Fillies, man.
We killed that last night.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.625
Ew. Move your eyeball.

00:11:09.708 --> 00:11:11.875
Did we show up and show out?
Yes, we did!

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.625
That was amazing!

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:18.291
Wait, hold on now.
Make sure you get my good eye.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.333
Thelma?

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.416
Mmm...

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:56.625
Oh, hey.

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:58.666
Hey, weirdo. Nice carrot horn.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.500
Otis, what do I remind you of?

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:04.583
Uh... A pony with a large edible mass
growing out of its brain?

00:12:04.666 --> 00:12:06.625
What? No, you ding-dong.

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:09.000
Come on, for real this time. Try again.

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:13.166
Ah.

00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.583
Wait, I got it. You're a carrot
with a pony stuck to its butt.

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:20.583
Wrong! Come on, Otis.
You can do better than that.

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.208
Uh... Oh, you're the new mascot
for Root Vegetable Awareness Month.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.833
Otis, you're killing me.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.166
Look out!

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.083
Huh?

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:59.083
Ugh! Gross! What is this stuff?

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:03.750
Uh... Thelma, I think you better
go take a look at yourself.

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.708
I swear, that dude
needs to learn how to drive.

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:11.875
What?

00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:18.541
I'm a unicorn.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:20.500
I'm a unicorn.

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:22.625
I'm a unicorn!

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:24.333
Woo-hoo!

00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:28.000
A fake unicorn.

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:29.500
Ha ha! Who cares?

00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:32.083
Take a picture of me
so I can post it on Pigstagram.

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:35.041
Oh! Wait, wait, wait.
Let me delete my old account first.

00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:39.041
I'm gonna create a whole new profile.
It'll be like the old me never existed.

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:41.833
Don't delete the old you.
I'm friends with the old you.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.083
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.291
Here. Just take the photo.
Just take the photo.

00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.166
Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.375
One, two, three.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:56.375
Let me see. Let me see. How do I look?

00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:58.833
Oh.
Man, stop playing with me.

00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:00.750
For real this time.

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:05.166
Look! Look! There's a unicorn!
I told you they were real!

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:17.583
Unicorn, unicorn, unicorn,
unicorn, unicorn, unicorn!

00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:19.041
- Unicorn!
- Whoo!

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:23.541
So you're just gonna let people think
you're a real unicorn now?

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:26.958
This is the best day of my life.
Oh my gosh, she's so beautiful.

00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:30.375
Well, I'm definitely
not gonna break that little girl's heart.

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:31.875
Hi.

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:35.041
- Oh, hey, baby. What's your name?
- Suzie.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.125
- What's your name?
- Thelma.

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:38.291
Thelma?

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.125
Thelma the Unicorn?

00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:42.250
Can I take your picture?

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.458
Yeah, girl.
Course you can take my picture.

00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:45.458
But watch out.

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:47.916
My sparkles might blow up your phone.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.517
- Is this real? This is a mirage.
- I can't believe this.

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.226
- What a dream duo.
- Okay, get ready.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.541
Say "cheese."

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:55.125
Cheese!

00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:57.083
Smile with them teeth!

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:59.017
- Honey, all of your teeth.
- Like this?

00:14:59.041 --> 00:15:01.083
Too much teeth, baby.

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.291
Unicorn dust?

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:05.333
I'll bet it tastes like candy.

00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:07.456
Ooh, rub some of that dust on me.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.625
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.750
Check this out.

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:13.625
Hold up.

00:15:13.708 --> 00:15:15.625
I don't believe it. A real unicorn!

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:19.333
{\an8}I wonder if she can grant me
eternal youth.

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:22.333
- Can your horn shoot lasers?
- Um...

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:25.083
- Does your poo smell like flowers?
- Well...

00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:27.750
- What color is your blood?
- Rainbow colored.

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:31.875
- You don't really sound like a unicorn.
- Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.208
I thought they were supposed
to sound like...

00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:38.250
"Hi, I'm a unicorn!
My tears turn into glitter and cupcakes!"

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:41.250
Yeah, well, all those unicorns
got eaten by dragons.

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:43.625
Oh.

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45.416
Can you do anything magical?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.666
- Magical?
- Yeah, can you?

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.208
Uh... Yeah. I can sing.

00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:51.500
Sing for us!

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:52.708
- Sing for us!
- Sing!

00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:53.625
Please?

00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:56.416
Otis, go get your guitar.
This is our big chance.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.958
You can't be serious.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.208
- You wanna perform like this?
- Yes!

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.250
Um... Excuse me?

00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:05.333
Are you really a real unicorn?

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:14.500
Yes. Yes, I am.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.125
- No way!
- Cool.

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:21.416
All right!

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.166
Psst. Thelma.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.166
Reggie?

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.541
The new makeover looks sick.

00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:28.583
Otis, get over there.

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:30.458

That was awesome!

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.125
Well......looks like
we're going to see a unicorn.

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.333
Suffice it to say,

00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:57.166
we don't get many unicorns
putting on rock shows in these parts.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.666
That's just not something
you see in this region.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.375
No, not generally.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:05.333
- Thanks for coming. You too, bald guy.
- Yeah, Thelma! Woo-hoo-hoo!

00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.333
Yeah!

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:08.875
All right.
Don't forget about my band.

00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:12.083
- Hey, you guys want my autograph?
- No, thanks.

00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:15.541
I can't believe it, Otis.
People actually liked our music!

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.666
That was insane!

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.375
Uh, but I think we should try
to get that stuff off you now.

00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:23.750
What? No way. Uh-uh.
I'm not washing this off.

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.750
This is exactly
what I've been waiting for.

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:29.708
- I'm finally special.
- You were special before all this, Thelma.

00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:31.708
You don't need this unicorn stuff.

00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:35.791
And why not? You pretend all the time.
You're Dank-Poopy-Butt, or whatever it is.

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:37.291
It's Donk-Truvious.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:40.000
And it's totally different.
That's just a game.

00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:41.583
But think about it, Otis.

00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:45.166
No one even paid attention to us
until I turned into this unicorn.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.833
The Rusty Buckets finally have
a lead singer that looks like a star.

00:19:48.916 --> 00:19:51.833
Yeah, but I didn't think
this would be a forever thing.

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:54.833

giving our music a chance.

00:19:57.208 --> 00:19:58.875

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:49.000

How's my favorite little assistant?

00:20:57.333 --> 00:20:59.833
Doing great, Nikki.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:02.833

00:21:02.916 --> 00:21:03.833

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:05.083

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:09.583

a blubber massage at one, and...

Oh!

Nikki, there's an awful review
of your show in the paper.

00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.125
I don't want you to hear it at all.

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.041
Listen.

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:53.208

{\an8}Ooh, ouchie.

00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:05.333
Vic, why are you reading this to me?

00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:09.541
- Yeah, Vic, what the heck?
- Well, because I'm your manager, darling.

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:12.083
I don't care what the critics say.

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:14.125
My fans love "Blubber Trouble."

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:16.875
It's the number one song
in the world right now.

00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:20.291
You're right, Nikki.
Number one, but with a two after it. Heh.

00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:24.500
Nikki, I'm going to tell you like it is
because I love ya.

00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:26.458
Your fame is on life support.

00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:31.833
If we don't find some kind of a jolt soon,
your career will be dead as a dodo.

00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:33.375
Well, then fix it!

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:38.041
We need to build your brand
beyond the music, Nikki.

00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:40.375
We need to strategize.

00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:43.083
You're the manager. You strategize.

00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:46.958
Megan, get me a bucket of cod. Now!

00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:48.625

Uh-oh. That's not good.

00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:11.500
You just summoned a demon.

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:14.041
Oh yeah? Well, bring it on, demon.

Ooh. No! You've taken my soul!

00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:27.916
Hold up. Do you hear that?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.375
Uh... Yeah.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:50.625
Whoa. Is that...

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:54.250
That's... That's Peggy Purvis,
the legendary music producer!

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.958
No way! I... I thought she retired.

00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:58.708
What is she doing here?

00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.708
I believe she's here
to see you, little missy.

00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:03.666
Whoa.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.708
Oh, those are some stinky licks.

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:09.625
You're pretty stanky yourself.

00:24:09.708 --> 00:24:12.708
Woo-hoo! That sounded amazing, y'all!

00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:14.375
Thelma!

00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:17.916
Thelma! Thelma!
I just got to jam with a guitar legend!

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I know! That's so crazy!

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:21.416
Thelma, right?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.541
Peggy Purvis.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.875
Wow. Uh, I'm a huge fan.

00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:27.791
That song you sang on the news today?

00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:30.791
I ain't never heard anything like it.

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.500
For real? Thank you.

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:34.208
How'd you come up with it?

00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:37.875
Oh, that old thing?
I wrote that a long time ago.

00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.458
I just never had a chance
to play it for anybody.

00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:43.541
Gee, kid, you're really something special.

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:45.375
And she's a unicorn.

00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:47.791
I don't care what she is.

00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:51.250
This girl, she could sing the phone book
and make you cry.

00:24:51.333 --> 00:24:53.250
I don't know about that.

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:56.083
So, you kids wanna make a record?

00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.208
Knock-knock. Anyone home?

00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:08.666
Are you serious? That would be our dream.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.125
But I thought that you, uh...

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:12.750
Stopped producing music
after I went blind?

00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:15.666
Yeah, well,
maybe you could be my comeback.

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:20.416
Grab your bags.
I'm not getting any younger.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.958
We're making an album with Peggy Purvis?

00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:25.250
What?!

00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:41.708
Watch your step.

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:51.500
Wow.

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:53.958
I've never been in a real studio before.

00:25:54.041 --> 00:25:55.250
Whoa!

00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:59.625
Oh!

00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:01.625
Well, get used to it.

00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:04.041
My gut tells me
you gonna be in here a lot.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.583
No way!

00:26:06.666 --> 00:26:09.083
You recorded Patsy Swine
and Smokey Buffalo here?

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.166
Sure did.

00:26:10.208 --> 00:26:12.958
Someday, The Rusty Buckets'
picture's gonna be up there too.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:13.916
Boom.

00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:19.416
You know, it's funny.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.041
A lot of people told us we'd never make it
'cause we didn't look like stars.

00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:26.416
Well, it's a good thing
I don't care what you look like, Thelma.

00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.958
Peggy, be real with me.

00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:31.001
Do you think you could get us
into SparklePalooza?

00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:34.375
Nope, can't guarantee you
anything like that.

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:38.166
But you can get yourself
to SparklePalooza by singing the truth.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.666
Sing it from your heart.

00:26:40.875 --> 00:26:43.500
Yeah, I got this one song
I've been working on

00:26:43.583 --> 00:26:45.083
since I was a little kid.

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:48.625
- Just never found the right words for it.
- Baby, don't worry about it.

00:26:48.708 --> 00:26:50.541
Lyrics are like food poisoning.

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:52.500
It hits you when you least expect it.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.541

in that songbook of yours.

00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:58.416

Peggy, darling,
I've got great news for you.

00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:21.208
It's Vic Diamond.
Listen, I'm so glad you answered,

00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:23.583
because I thought
you'd probably be dead by now.

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:26.833
Hey, I'm delighted to be wrong this time.

00:28:26.916 --> 00:28:28.208

00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.791
Well, buckle up, Peggy.

Uh... Yes, I can. Check this out. Refused.

00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:46.666
Oh. Then I suppose you're not interested
in her opening for Nikki Narwhal today

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.375
She's a big, yet minuscule, fan.

00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:10.416
Hey.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.041
- Ugh.
- Okay.

00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:17.166
Oh, Nikki, you're so awkward.

00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:20.916
Opening today
for the first time ever,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.041
we bring you the viral singing sensation,
Thelma the Unicorn!

00:33:26.125 --> 00:33:29.416
{\an8}Vic, I can't do this without my band.
Where are they?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.666
Oh no. Do you think they've abandoned you?

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.583
No, of course not.

00:33:35.666 --> 00:33:38.083
Some bands just aren't ready
for the big stage.

00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.000
But they wouldn't just bail like that.

00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:41.583
You poor, poor thing.

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:44.416
I know how badly you wanted this.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.208
Would you like me to cancel the show?

00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:59.583
No. I've been waiting
for something like this my whole life.

00:34:00.416 --> 00:34:03.375
- Let's do this thing.
- Fantastic.

00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:06.833
Now, let's get out there
and show everyone how special you are.

00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:28.666

- Whoa!

00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:24.333
I got you, girl.

00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:29.291
I'm so sorry, Vic.
I... I didn't mean for this to happen.

00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:33.541
One supernova must implode
so a new star can take its place.

00:37:34.541 --> 00:37:38.625
I could turn you into the biggest star
on the planet, Thelma.

00:37:38.708 --> 00:37:42.833
Thanks, Vic, but I've already got
Peggy to help me with my music.

00:37:42.916 --> 00:37:49.083
Thelma, Thelma, if you stay with Peggy,
you'll never make it to SparklePalooza.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.458
Don't you get it?

00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:54.625
Working with me
will guarantee you play there someday.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.875
Well, can I bring my band with me?

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:00.458
Of course you can, darling.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.625
Sign with me,
and your dream will become a reality.

00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:13.416
Thelma! Thelma! Thelma!

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.750
Thelma! Thelma! Thelma!

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:19.666
I'm only going
to make this offer once.

00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.916
Congratulations, my dear unicorn.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.750
We are officially in business.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.208
Now, let's get out of here
before that whale impales us both.

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:41.083
Thelma, take a selfie with me!

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.458
Whoo! Thelma!

00:38:44.541 --> 00:38:48.375
I have these adoption papers
that will legally make me your son!

00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:49.791
Will you sign them for me?

00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:59.708
Look, your very own unichopper.

00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.250
Wow.

00:39:03.333 --> 00:39:04.416
Thelma!

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.458
- Hey, let go of me. Thelma!
- Otis?

00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:08.916
Wh... Where have you been?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.750
We've been trying to find you.
Why'd you perform without us?

00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:14.583
What was I supposed to do?
You guys completely abandoned me.

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:15.875
We didn't abandon you.

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:18.875
A missile came out of nowhere
and blew up our car.

00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:21.458
Tsk. Come on, Otis.
You don't have to make up stories.

00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:22.750
Just tell me the truth.

00:39:22.833 --> 00:39:24.041
No, I'm serious.

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:26.166
Look, I don't wanna fight with you.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.458
Vic promised me he could get us
all to SparklePalooza, so let's go.

00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.041
I knew this unicorn stuff
would go to your head.

00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:35.833
Gimme a break.
You didn't even wanna be here.

00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:37.875
You said we weren't ready
for the big stage.

00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:41.041
Mommy, is this donkey bothering you?

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:42.541
Hey, hold on. Who is this?

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:44.500
I am her son.

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:45.458
Your son?

00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:47.291
Yeah. Go away.

00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:49.958
You're just gonna let your son
talk to me like that?

00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:53.208
Otis, I've been wanting this
my whole life.

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:54.916
I'm tired of being overlooked.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.791
If you've been wanting this
your whole life,

00:39:56.875 --> 00:40:00.166
then why are you screwing it up
by pretending to be someone else?

00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.583
We love you, Thelma!

00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:21.958
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:40:22.625 --> 00:40:25.500
Will Nikki Narwhal
ever bounce back from her epic meltdown?

00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:27.583
- Run away!
- "Blubber Trouble!"

00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.958
Or is it the end
of the road for this disgraced diva?

00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:34.625
Look out, Nikki, 'cause you're about
to get replaced by Thelma the Uni...

00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:45.375
Listen, Megan, and listen a lot.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:50.166
The only way I'll ever be back
on top is if we destroy Thelma.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.958
Ooh, are we talking about murder here?

00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:55.500
What? No!

00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:59.250
I just need you to dig up the dirt
that will ruin her forever,

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:01.833
because everyone's got secrets.

00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:04.166
Oh wow.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.958
You are so dang smart, Nikki.

00:41:07.041 --> 00:41:10.333
I swear, it's that
big ol' whale brain of yours.

00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:13.416
Thank you.
My doctor says it's mainly water.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.791
Boom, Nikki, you go, girl!

00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:17.875
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:21.166
Get out there and find
that unicorn's dirty little secrets!

00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:23.791
Oh yeah.

00:41:32.666 --> 00:41:34.125
Boom shebang.

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:36.916
Good morning, my little pink glitter puff.

00:41:38.666 --> 00:41:42.416
I've brought you some noodles and candies.

00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:44.083
Um...

00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:47.708
I don't know what unicorns eat.
Is it noodles and candies?

00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:51.458
Vic...

00:41:51.541 --> 00:41:53.250
...I think I've made a huge mistake.

00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:55.708
Oh no. What is it, my love?

00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:58.208
I shouldn't have left my band
and Peggy like that.

00:41:58.291 --> 00:42:01.291
Oh, come, come.
That ship has sailed, darling.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.041
But don't you worry,

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:06.791
because we're gonna make
some sweet unicorn magic together.

00:42:07.583 --> 00:42:10.541
There's something
I got to tell you first.

00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:11.666
Yes?

00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:15.416
I'm not a real unicorn.

00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:20.583
No! Please tell me you're joking!

00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:24.458
Oh wait. I don't care.

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.833
You don't?

00:42:25.916 --> 00:42:29.375
Of course not.
You think these teeth are real?

00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.125
Aah!

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.875
Truth is the death of success.

00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:40.041
The most important thing
in the music biz is how you look.

00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:43.875
Why don't you chew on that knowledge bomb
and see how it tastes?

00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:45.250
Oh yeah.

00:42:45.333 --> 00:42:47.875
All right, then.
Tell me what I gotta do.

00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:50.041
That's my unicorn.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.666
You're lucky,
because I'm going to teach you

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.875
what I taught me a long time ago.

00:42:57.958 --> 00:43:00.416
The Three Cs to Success.

00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:02.958
Step one, change.

00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:07.000
To be successful, you have to change,
not once, but every day.

00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:08.458
Sometimes twice a day.

00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:10.250

00:44:57.666 --> 00:45:00.083
I became a mover and a shaker.

00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:02.666
I became the Star Maker.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.375

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:13.291
Nobody interrupts Vic Diamond
except Vic Diamond.

00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:15.416

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:02.666
So, what's the plan now?

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.708
I'm so glad you asked.

00:46:04.791 --> 00:46:07.250
See that handsome stud over there?

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:09.416
That's Danny Stallion,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.416
VideoTubeTube megastar.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.666
Hey, nice to meet you too.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.750
No way. Uh-uh.
I do not want a fake boyfriend.

00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:21.750
He got famous last year
for his chewing cud videos.

00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:27.416
Uh-oh! Here comes the cud!

00:46:30.083 --> 00:46:32.166
Ugh.

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.041
Nasty. He got famous for that?

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:37.916
Over a billion views and counting.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.500
Now, get over there
and make some sparks fly for the cameras.

00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:42.458
What?

00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:44.166
Give love a chance.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:47.500
All right. You're the Star Maker.

00:46:47.583 --> 00:46:50.250
Off we go. This is happening.

00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:54.083
Oh, thanks, Danny.

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:57.083
Yeah, don't spend it all in one place.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.166
Uh... You must be Danny.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.750
Hey! You must be Thelma.

00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:07.541
You wanna see something cool?

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:08.750
Uh, no, I'm good.

00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:14.625
Hey, aren't you gonna play along?
There are people watching us.

00:47:14.708 --> 00:47:16.750
Whoa, what happened to your voice?

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:20.125
Come on, you know.
This whole thing is just an act.

00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:22.250
I'm actually studying
to become a brain surgeon.

00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:23.375
You are?

00:47:23.458 --> 00:47:27.666
Gotta pay for med school somehow, right?
Now, let's give the people what they want.

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.583
Okay.

00:47:29.625 --> 00:47:32.250
Uh-oh! Here comes the cud!

00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:39.458
The coolest!

00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:44.500
Danny and Thelma, over here!

00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:46.125
- Hey, Danny!
- Hey, lovebirds!

00:47:46.208 --> 00:47:48.833
- Big smiles for the camera!
- Gnarly.

00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:58.833
Ever since
Sad Horse Lady left my side,

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.541
the goblins have laid siege
to the Oregon Trail.

00:48:04.583 --> 00:48:08.125
Will life on the prairie ever be the same?

00:48:10.708 --> 00:48:11.541
Woo-hoo!

00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:26.500
Much obliged, stranger.

00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:30.333
The pleasure is all mine.

00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:34.708
Donk-Truvious!

00:48:40.958 --> 00:48:42.250
Thelma?

00:48:42.833 --> 00:48:43.833
Look out!

00:48:44.375 --> 00:48:47.250
Leaving you was a huge mistake,
Donk-Truvious.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:51.208
Let's get the band back together
and join forces posthaste.

00:48:51.708 --> 00:48:55.500
- That's a splendid idea.
- Too late for that, bro.

00:48:58.083 --> 00:49:00.666
Looks like Thelma's already
got a new bandmate.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:01.583
What?

00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:07.541
The hot new couple now known
as "Theldannystanicorn" went public today,

00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:10.875
announcing a whole new line
of game-changing products.

00:49:10.958 --> 00:49:12.125
Yeah!

00:49:12.208 --> 00:49:16.416
{\an8}Don't forget to try our new cereal,
Thelm-O's and D-Flakes.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.916
Yummy-yum!

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.291
As a special prize, I've hidden
five unicorn hairs inside each box.

00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:23.250
Whoo!

00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:25.083
Shove it in your face!

00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:26.750
I'm really sorry, boys.

00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:32.833
Welcome to Huge Sellout Records,

00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:35.666
where everything we make
sells out immediately.

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:41.166
Right this way. Watch your step.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:45.541
This is my inner sanctum,
where all the magic happens.

00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:48.708
Can you smell the success?

00:49:48.791 --> 00:49:50.500
That's my cologne.

00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:51.916
Cool.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.208
- Uh... Where are your instruments?
- Oh, Thelma.

00:49:56.583 --> 00:49:59.041
{\an8}You can drop the act, buddy.
There's nobody here.

00:49:59.125 --> 00:50:00.041
Sorry.

00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:05.791
Sometimes I think the character I created
might actually be the real me.

00:50:07.666 --> 00:50:08.791
Oh boy.

00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:11.625
This is our lyrics room...

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:13.000
...and that's Bridget,

00:50:13.083 --> 00:50:16.250
the AI machine
that generates all the hits.

00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:18.916
Any ideas for a song, you two?

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.916
Oh yeah. I got a song idea right here.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.166
- I just need some lyrics for it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.916
We're not making your music,
you silly goose.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.625
The algorithm will give us the groove.

00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:31.416
What are you talking about?

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.750
I got a book full of jams
ready to go right now.

00:50:33.833 --> 00:50:35.513
We just gotta go in there
and lay 'em down.

00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:39.208
Uh, how about,
why don't we make a song about my cud?

00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:40.875
Are you for real?

00:50:40.958 --> 00:50:43.291
Excellent idea, Danny Stallion.

00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:44.833
Bridget, give me a song

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:49.041
about the partly digested
food particles known as "cud."

00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.958
Anything for you, Vic.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.190
Calculating.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.291
Doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:58.666
Nice one, Bridget.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.166
Get ready, you two.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.250
We're about to shake the world.

00:51:07.833 --> 00:51:09.875
{\an8}Turn it up.

00:51:09.958 --> 00:51:14.041
{\an8}No, turn it down. That's too much.

Peggy booked us a gig down the street.

I mean, yes, we did, but...

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.583
- Thelma!
- That's her.

00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:39.250
Whoo!

00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:41.000
Whoa.

00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:44.125
I'm so excited to meet you!
I am such a huge fan!

00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:45.875
Oh... Thanks.

00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:49.083
Like, I totally wanna cut off
one of my horns so I can be just like you.

00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:50.333
Don't you love her?

00:54:50.416 --> 00:54:52.750
It's so inspiring to meet you!

00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:54.875
Someone that sings her truth.

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:58.250
You're like the most genuine artist ever.

00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:04.833
- Yeah.
- Hey, you're holding up the line.

00:55:06.416 --> 00:55:07.625
Guess we better go.

00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:09.666
Well, thanks for stopping by.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.583
- Bye!
- See ya.

00:55:11.666 --> 00:55:13.500
Take care of yourself, Thelma.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.458
Thelma!

00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:18.666
We love you, Thelma!

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.000
Oh baby! "Here Comes the Cud"

Thelma, I've got some amazing news!

00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:56.791
I've just booked you
to headline SparklePalooza in two weeks.

00:57:56.875 --> 00:57:59.208
- What?
- I told you I'd make it happen.

00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:00.875
Now, get yourself cleaned up.

00:58:00.958 --> 00:58:03.250
We've got the Music Video Awards tonight.

00:58:05.791 --> 00:58:07.625
Hi! Who are you wearing?

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.291
The world's hottest musicians
have gathered tonight in Hollywood,

00:58:22.375 --> 00:58:25.375
hoping to win
Best Music Video of the Year.

00:58:26.416 --> 00:58:29.500
Returning for the first time
since her big meltdown

00:58:29.583 --> 00:58:34.291
is "Blubber Trouble" superstar,
Nikki Narwhal!

00:58:35.625 --> 00:58:37.291
Blubber Trouble's here.

00:58:37.375 --> 00:58:38.958
Boo!

00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:40.666
Oh, boo you!

00:58:44.125 --> 00:58:47.375
- Push, Megan, push. Get me out of here!
- I got you, girl.

00:58:47.458 --> 00:58:49.500
- They're here!
- Thelma!

00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:53.416
Could you ever imagine
our lives would turn out like this?

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.208
Not in a million years.

00:58:56.166 --> 00:59:00.000
Well, there's no turning back now!

00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:04.833
{\an8}We love you, Thelma!

00:59:04.916 --> 00:59:06.458
Hey, get my good side.

00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:09.875
Hey, make some room.

00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:13.416
Thelma sent fans into a frenzy this week

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:17.666
when it was announced
she'll be performing at SparklePalooza.

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:19.333
Thelma?

00:59:19.416 --> 00:59:20.333
Thelma?

00:59:20.416 --> 00:59:23.916
- I just can't wait to get on that stage.
- Thelma, over here!

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.250
- Otis?
- Hey, hey, who are you wearing?

00:59:28.333 --> 00:59:31.541
We're wearing Flavio Donzini.

00:59:32.125 --> 00:59:33.125
Thelma?

00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:36.375
Hey, check me out.

00:59:36.458 --> 00:59:37.875
Wait, Thelma! Wait! Wait!

00:59:37.958 --> 00:59:39.833
Come on, you little babies.

00:59:39.916 --> 00:59:43.958
- Hey, wish us luck. Bye.
- Danny, those chaps are fire.

00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:48.583
And the award
for Best Eyebrows in a Music Video

00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:52.416
goes to the Treble Twins!

00:59:54.875 --> 00:59:55.750
Oh!

00:59:58.166 --> 01:00:00.166
Those guys are great.

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:04.250
Oh no, Thelma! Your face is falling apart.

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.458
- What?
- I'd run to the loo and fix it.

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:08.500
Our category is almost up.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.333
Oh no.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.625
Aah!

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.500
Hello, Thelma.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.625
Ooh, girl!

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:33.041
You scared the jelly beans out of me.
You just been hanging out in there?

01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:40.375
Here, I just wanted to give you this.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.833
Oh. Uh, okay. Thanks.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:52.208
It's funny. I didn't know unicorn horns
could detach themselves like that.

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:54.208
What?

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:56.083
Why you doing this?

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:59.583
Because I'll do anything
to get Nikki back on top.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.250
Ugh...

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:18.625
A carrot?

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:22.416
Your magic horn was a carrot?

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.416
Ha!

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.666
I knew there was no such thing
as unicorns.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.708
Please, I... I can explain.

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:31.375
Oh, that won't be necessary.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:35.500
After I post this video, the whole world
will know what you really are.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:38.166
Just a phony little pony.

01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:42.625
Oh man, I can't wait
to see the look on everyone's faces

01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:44.791
when they find out how you betrayed them.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.333
Megan, please don't do this.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.125
I can't go back to the way things were.

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:50.833
I'll give you anything you want.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.666
Too late for that, Thelma.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.625
Time for the world to see you
as the pathetic creature you are.

01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:02.000
Wait, stop! Don't!

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:03.583
Just...

01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:06.041
Just let me disappear.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:10.333
You'll never see
or hear from me ever again.

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:12.500
It'll be like I never existed.

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:15.291
Fine.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.041
But I want you gone for good.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:21.500
Because if you ever try to come back,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
you know exactly what will happen to you.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.291
Bye-bye now.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.875
Thelma! Thelma, where are you?

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:49.333
Excuse me,
have you seen a tiny pink unicorn,

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:52.166
loves to sing about farts and acid reflux?

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.333
Oh, never mind!

01:02:56.416 --> 01:03:00.833
Thelma, Thelma, please,
come to Vicky. Thelma!

01:03:00.916 --> 01:03:04.708
And the winner
for Best Music Video of the Year

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:10.791
goes to "Here Comes the Cud"
by Danny Stallion and Thelma the Unicorn.

01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:13.833

Mission accomplished.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.166
Ha ha ha! Nice one.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:35.708
You'll be back on top in a week.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:38.666
Blast it!

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:41.041
Thelma's missing!

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.125
Huh?!

01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:47.166
I... I don't mean to alarm you,
but we seem to have lost Thelma.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.541
What?

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.875
No!

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:54.666
Would everyone please take a moment
and look under your seats for Thelma?

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.791
She's a unicorn. She's quite small.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.333
She may have gotten trapped
under your bum.

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:09.208
Thelma?!

01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:34.000
The entire world is in mourning today

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:36.541
after learning about
the sudden disappearance

01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:38.583
of Thelma the Unicorn.

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:44.458
Volunteers everywhere
are desperately trying to find Thelma

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.041
in any way they can.

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.041
Thelma!

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:48.500
- Thelma!
- Thelma!

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.958
Mama!

01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:54.833
It suddenly feels like all magic
and hope have been lost in the world.

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:56.750
Thelma, where are you?

01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:59.416
Thelma, please come home. We need you.

01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:03.083
Thelma, we love you.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.500
Thelma, where are you?

01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:32.166
Hey, horse lady, you need a ride?

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.666
So where you headed, kid?

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:43.416
Maybe the next rest stop
so I can flush myself down the toilet.

01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:49.458
Whoo! Well, I've heard that one before.

01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:53.458
You know, being on the road
makes you wanna ponder,

01:05:53.541 --> 01:05:54.541
and I ponder a lot.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.083
I might as well call my brain
"The Ponderosa."

01:05:58.166 --> 01:06:00.166
Hey, you mind if I ask you a question?

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.375
Um...

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.458
Yeah, go ahead.

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:06.083
You ever wake up and realize
you've been living a lie?

01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:09.416
Boy, do I know what that's like.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:14.958
H-h-here's the deal.

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:18.583
I just got engaged
to the woman of my dreams,

01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:21.541
but I've been keeping
a huge secret from her.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.458
Really?

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:24.291
What is it?

01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:26.166
No! No! No!

01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:32.291
Well, I'm a world-famous champion
on the underground clogging circuit.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.250
There's an underground clogging circuit?

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:38.458
Oh, we have dance battles
in sewers and old grain silos.

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:39.541
Whoa!

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:42.666
My fans
call me Gregory Thunder Calves,

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.583
given the fact that my calves are so big.

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:49.791
So, what's the big deal?

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.875
Why don't you just
tell your girlfriend the truth?

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.041
Well, I...

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:57.041
I'm... I'm just afraid, I guess.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:07:00.458
I mean, what if she hates clogging
and totally rejects me?

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:02.541
Look, if she really loves you,

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:05.000
then maybe she'll love
everything about you,

01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:06.166
even the clogging.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:08.166
You really think so?

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.500
I mean, I hope so.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:11.916
No matter what happens,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.208
it's gonna be better than spending
the rest of your life living a lie.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.666
You're perfect just as you are.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:19.708
Wow.

01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:22.875
You must have, like,
zero problems in your life.

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.208
Yeah!

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.000
Stop the truck!

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:33.333
Whoa!

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.750
- Something's up, ain't it?
- We need to turn around.

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:36.708
I need to go back.

01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:39.625
Well, let me just put
the old turn signal on.

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:06.166
Thelma?

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.208
Thelma!

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:15.250
Where have you been?
I've been searching all over for you.

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:16.375
Are... Are you okay?

01:08:16.458 --> 01:08:18.791
I'm fine, Otis. I'm fine.

01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:20.958
I've just been so worried about you.

01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:25.000
But I don't deserve it.
I should've never left you guys.

01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:26.791
It's okay. You're back now.

01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:28.541
No, it's not okay.

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:30.291
I screwed up big-time.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.833
I thought being a unicorn
would make all my dreams come true.

01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:36.916
Instead, I lost the people
who love me the most.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.041
Stop it, Thelma. You're making me blush.

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.750
No, seriously.

01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:44.833
I'd be happy playing music anywhere,
as long as it's with you.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:46.708
Thanks, Thelma.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.791
You were right all along.

01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:53.333
I've gotta come clean now.

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:55.083
Wait. Are you serious?

01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:58.833
It's time to show everyone
who the real Thelma is.

01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:01.333
Aah-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:09:01.416 --> 01:09:03.083
Whoo!

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:06.250
Sure you don't wanna wear
this bad boy again?

01:09:06.333 --> 01:09:07.833
"Put me on your head, Thelma."

01:09:07.916 --> 01:09:10.166
Get that nasty thing out of my face.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.041
Thelma!

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.833
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:19.708
What's up, Reggie?

01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.083
Hi, Thelma.

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:22.166
Peggy!

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:27.750
I'm so sorry.
I never should have left you.

01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:30.000
Don't worry about it, kid.
I knew you'd come around.

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:33.750
I'm sure you've already heard,
but I'm not really a unicorn.

01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:36.625
Yeah. I smelled paint on you
from the very beginning.

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:39.083
Come on, everyone.

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:41.000
SparklePalooza's about to begin,

01:09:41.083 --> 01:09:43.666
and no one's stopping us
from getting on that stage.

01:09:44.458 --> 01:09:47.583
Hey, I think you're gonna need this.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.791
Thousands of fans
from all over the globe have gathered

01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:03.708
for SparklePalooza,
the biggest music event of the year.

01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:05.250
And while the world still mourns

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:07.750
over the disappearance
of Thelma the Unicorn,

01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:11.750

pink unicorn will return.

here to reclaim her crown
as the original Queen of Pop.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:52.000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.166
Stop. You're plugging my blowhole.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:59.208
Listen, if any of you morons
see anyone pretending to be Thelma,

01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:01.791
I want you to notify me immediately.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:03.250
Any questions?

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:07.208
Is now a bad time
to order a stuffed crust pizza?

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:09.416
I told y'all to eat before you came.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.916

01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:16.583
Reggie, are you sure
this is gonna work?

01:11:16.666 --> 01:11:18.375
Just trust me.

01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:27.423
And we now have
Chuck on the line.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.791
Chuck, are you ready to play
The Million-Dollar Quiz Show?

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.250
I sure am, Bill.

01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:36.291
Aw, how are we gonna get in?

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.916
Don't worry, I know how to pick locks.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.291
Let's roll!

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:48.125
Chuck, for the million dollars,
all you have to do is finish this title.

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:51.250
"Goldilocks and the Three..." What?

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:52.541
Huh?

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.666
Chuck, are you there?

01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:00.541
Chuck, if you don't answer,
I'm gonna have to go to our next caller.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:02.916
Well, better luck next time, Chuck.
Goodbye.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.083

Hello, Thelma.

01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:21.583
You really thought
you could just prance right in here

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:23.916
and steal my thunder again?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.333
No, Nikki, I swear.

01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:29.375
Well, news flash, Thelma.
You're nothing without your sparkles.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:33.291
You're just a worthless little pony
that no one wants to listen to.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:35.708
I'm the real horned superstar.

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:41.750
Boom. Nikki's the real tuna,
not some canned substitute.

01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:43.916
Nikki, please. We don't want no trouble.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.125
Ha! You really wanna sparkle again?

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:49.375
This should do the trick.

01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:02.375
Stop them!

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:15.625
Girl, you ain't breaking up this band.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:25.750
We're finally here, Thelma!
SparklePalooza!

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.083

{\an8}Hey, I'll be right back.
There's something I gotta do.

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:42.916
Hey, w-w-wait! Thelma!

01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:49.291
Yeah! Huh?

01:16:52.583 --> 01:16:53.916
Who are those guys?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.458
- Boo! Get off the stage!
- Boo!

01:16:58.416 --> 01:17:00.208
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:02.208
- Ow.
- Boo!

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:03.500
Boo!

01:17:13.125 --> 01:17:14.291
Thelma?

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.250
What are you doing?

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:34.583
Hey, everybody.

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:39.041
I know you must be wondering
where I've been all this time.

01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:41.416
I don't blame you.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.625
I've been wondering that myself.

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:48.083
Ever since I was little,

01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:51.250
I always dreamed
about performing on this stage.

01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:56.250
But I never thought I'd make it here
because of how I looked.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:18:02.000
Something inside me just kept telling me
I wasn't good enough.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:06.250
Then one day, this crazy thing happened,

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:09.333
and everyone finally started
paying attention to me.

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:12.250
But it's not who I really am.

01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:20.875
This... This is the real me.

01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:21.958
I'm Thelma.

01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:26.708
Boo!

01:18:26.791 --> 01:18:27.916
Boo!

01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:31.166
I'm really sorry.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.916
I never meant to hurt anyone. I just...

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.375
I just thought it was the only way
people would give my music a chance.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.708
And now,
I'd like to share a song with you.

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.666
I started writing it when I was a kid.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:51.791
I just never knew
what I needed to say until now.

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:55.583
