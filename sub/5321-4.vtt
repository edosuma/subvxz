29:55.360 --> 29:56.600
It's bad for branding.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.762
Besides, you're killing
our customers

29:58.920 --> 30:00.081
faster than the zombies.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.129
We tested Batch 47.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.642
We got a zombie to say 'brains'.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.290
A talking zombie?

30:08.440 --> 30:10.283
Well, this I got to see.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.489
This is the last vial
of the first batch.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.644
We can repeat my experiment
any time you want.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.849
Excellent. We should begin
human trials immediately.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.281
Wait a minute.
You... Wait a minute.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.010
ESCORPION: Vamos.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.730
Warren!

30:32.880 --> 30:34.086
What's going on?
Where's Vasquez and Mur...

30:34.240 --> 30:35.890
Mmm.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.886
Who are you?

30:50.040 --> 30:51.644
My name is Hector Alvarez.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.450
My friends call me Escorpion.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.888
I'm the vice president in charge of sales
for the Zero cartel.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.606
How can I help you today?

31:01.880 --> 31:06.044
Well, you can start by telling us
what the hell is going on.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.964
This?

31:08.120 --> 31:10.202
Just a little business
between friends.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.091
I see you've been harvesting.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.642
Let me guess. Batch 47?

31:21.560 --> 31:24.928
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
to give it to me.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.043
ESCORPION:
I know what you are thinking.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.602
I know that guy. He's one of
the top lieutenants in the Zeros.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.246
- If he finds us, he'll kill us.
- He'll kill you.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.925
Me, they want alive.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.401
Come on.
I know where we'll be safe.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.127
I'll take my chances out here.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.521
But that was then,
and this is now.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.001
We are the new Zeros.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.164
The more user-friendly Zeros.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.761
Admittedly,
the transition was not easy.

32:10.920 --> 32:14.003
Yeah, well,
change is always hard.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.204
You see, you know.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.483
But I digress.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.166
Where were we? Oh, yes.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.891
Batch 47.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.687
So this is the cure
everyone is talking about, huh?

32:36.840 --> 32:39.764
Reminds me of the Cocodrilo
we used to sell back in the day.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.650
Step one.
We need a fresh zombie.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.409
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

32:48.560 --> 32:49.846
(REPLIES IN SPANISH)

32:50.000 --> 32:53.527
Not that fresh, pendejo!
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

32:53.680 --> 32:56.331
(REPLIES IN SPANISH)

32:59.480 --> 33:01.403
I am very sorry about that.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.881
Good help is hard to find
these days.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.764
I've only ever tested it
on a zombie.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.566
I have no idea what a safe
or effective dose on a human is.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.087
There's only one way
to find out.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.483
I got a great idea.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.450
The Power Vape 3000.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.244
Solar-powered.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.801
The stuff
you potheads come up with.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.929
ESCORPION: I can
control the dose with this.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.684
Well, it only takes
a microdose

33:30.840 --> 33:32.205
to stimulate
the immune system.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.051
Any more than that
could be fatal.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.208
- Says who?
- Hey.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.203
Wait. No.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.526
(GROANS)

33:44.680 --> 33:46.682
Say when. Say when!

33:46.840 --> 33:48.968
(ODEGARD MOANS)

33:49.120 --> 33:50.884
Say when! Say when!

33:51.040 --> 33:52.530
When!

33:55.480 --> 33:58.689
Oh! Ha!

33:59.800 --> 34:01.245
WOW!

34:01.400 --> 34:02.890
I feel good.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.251
Good.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.129
Bring on the zombie.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.170
A bite from this zombie
and we'll know for sure.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.009
ESCORPION: Really? Now what?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.489
Odegard?

34:24.639 --> 34:27.324
Wait. Did you see him die?

34:28.520 --> 34:30.362
What are you,
some kind of living zombie?

34:30.520 --> 34:34.650
Yeah. The world needs that
like a hole in the head.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.482
So much for Batch 47.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.126
Grab the Z-Weed.
Let's get out of here, huh?

34:44.280 --> 34:48.001
(SPEAKS SPANISH AND LAUGHS)

34:49.520 --> 34:50.931
Who's this?

34:52.719 --> 34:55.530
- Dr Kurian?
- Hello, Hector.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.569
What happened to your face?

34:59.800 --> 35:01.211
That looks like
my mom's chicharrones.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.249
It's a long story.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.164
ESCORPION:
You can tell it to La Reina.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.525
(GROANS)

35:09.040 --> 35:11.008
Put him in the trunk, huh?

35:12.200 --> 35:15.329
- You two are in charge now.
- BOTH: Si, sefior.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.403
Burn the greenhouse down
with Batch 47.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.528
We need to get back
to our core mission.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.041
- You understand me?
- BOTH: Si, sefior.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.964
Vamos.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.411
(BOTH CONVERSE IN SPANISH)

35:56.880 --> 36:00.282
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

36:00.440 --> 36:03.762
- Drop it.
- How can I help you?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.731
Your tattoos. Show me.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.170
Do I know you?

36:20.000 --> 36:23.971
Hey! Hey. Come on. Get out.
You have to get out of here now.

36:24.160 --> 36:28.085
Come on! (GROANS) Move!

36:28.240 --> 36:29.810
You can do it!

36:29.960 --> 36:31.644
Move! You can do it!

36:37.640 --> 36:39.290
That's it.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.966
That's it. Come on!
Keep moving now.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.441
You have to save yourselves!
Come on, move!

to be in there! Hey!

Hey. Hey. How's she doing?

39:51.480 --> 39:53.847
(SOBS) It won't be long now.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.571
- Did they find the cure yet?
- WOMAN: Not yet, sweetie.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.849
Well, here.
I managed to save some.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.769
Just have her
chew on the leaves.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.725
They're not concentrated,
so she won't overdose.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.002
Thank you.

40:07.160 --> 40:10.130
WOMAN: Honey, it's here.
Batch 47.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.681

have to chew on the leaves, OK?

40:20.520 --> 40:22.249
We gotta go.

You're alive, aren't you?

41:23.920 --> 41:27.367
Why are we headed south?
Shouldn't we be going west?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.885
Still too much fallout west.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.690
We can turn west
south of Missouri.

woman doing out here by herself?

stopping for her, are you?
