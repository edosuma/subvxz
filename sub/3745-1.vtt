00:45.578 --> 00:47.944
- What?
- Happy anniversary.

00:50.183 --> 00:53.516
- The same to you.
- You want your present?

00:53.953 --> 00:56.285
- In other words, you want yours?
- I really do.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.186
All right. Here you go.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.760
Yeah, well, that seems fair.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.064
You go first.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.629
No.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.463
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.481
For God's sake!

01:25.351 --> 01:28.286
- Look what I got!
- It's a Swiss Army Knife.

01:28.455 --> 01:31.288
That's funny. I was actually
thinking of joining the Swiss army.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.256
- You can take it back.
- What are you talking about?

01:34.427 --> 01:37.419
It has a can opener, a corkscrew
and a nail file.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.191
And scissors, and tweezers,
and a fish scaler.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.631
And a saw, a toothpick and a little thing
to punch holes in your belt.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.566
Why would I want to punch holes
in my belt?

01:45.738 --> 01:47.433
The guy made it sound really important.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.598
He also said it was great for camping.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.143
Sure. It's got a little thing
here for trapping bear.

01:53.313 --> 01:55.941
- You really like it?
- How could I not like this?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.983
If you don't, it has a little thing
that comes out and stabs you.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.086
This is very cool. Thank you.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.482
- Okay. My turn.
- Your turn.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.618
- I got it.
- All right.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.162
It took her 45 minutes
to wrap this in the store.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.170
- Wow!
- You like it?

02:19.339 --> 02:22.035
I do.

02:22.208 --> 02:27.840
- It's a cotton candy machine.
- I see!

02:28.014 --> 02:29.948
- Get it?
- No.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.015
Second anniversary.
Cotton anniversary.

02:32.185 --> 02:35.348
That's good. That's really good.

02:35.522 --> 02:39.720
The guy said it'll pay for itself
in six months.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.487
Now we don't have to go
to the circus all the time.

02:42.662 --> 02:46.826
- No, really. I love it. I love it.
- Yeah? Want to try it out?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.332
- For breakfast?
- What the hell, it's our anniversary.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.332
Remember, we're having
three lunches today.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.267
Why does everybody
want to take us out?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.671
Don't they realize we're only fun
when we're alone?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.343
- Swear to God. You like this?
- I do. I love it.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.502
- Really?
- Really.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.347
- Me too. Mine. I love it.
- Good.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.392
- Look who's here! Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.863
- You can't keep a secret in this town.
- These are for you.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.094
- You don't have to do that.
- It always was a big day for us.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.261
- I know.
- It's fine. It's okay.

03:26.439 --> 03:31.274
All I want is for Fran to be happy. If it's
without me, fine. If it's with Ira, so be it.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.470
If Buddha's testing my patience,
<i>zei gezunt.</i>

03:35.915 --> 03:37.712
- What can I get you guys?
- Just some sugar.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.547
We have sugar, we have onions,
we have Aspergum and Yodels.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.484
- You have Yodels now?
- Where's the sugar?

03:43.656 --> 03:46.090
Sugar on the shelf, onions by the door.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.453
Who's looking for onions?

03:48.628 --> 03:51.529
Tell me how we did this. How did we
get three lunches in one day?

03:51.698 --> 03:54.758
It would have been four
but I consolidated our sisters.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.993
- Hello. How are you today?
- Good. How are you?

03:57.170 --> 04:00.503
Any day now. Oh! A little kick.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.464
Just right now?

04:02.642 --> 04:03.870
Here.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.835
Come here.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.406
It's like a whole little person in there.

04:12.518 --> 04:16.476
You know, if you were not pregnant,
this would be so inappropriate of me.

04:18.524 --> 04:22.255
- You didn't find the onions.
- What is it with him and the onions?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.225
- Do you have children?
- No, not yet.

04:24.397 --> 04:25.659
When?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.732
- I think maybe soon.
- Not for some time.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.325
Kim said you wanted onions?

04:36.042 --> 04:39.136
I never heard you use those words
before. "Maybe soon"?

04:39.312 --> 04:44.147
- It's not like we've never discussed it.
- We never discussed "maybe soon."

04:44.317 --> 04:47.514
- Is this level?
- Like the horizon.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.622
- We always said after a couple of years.
- Yeah, a couple of years.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.850
Well, we have now been married
a couple of years.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.858
Do you believe I bought the onions?

04:56.029 --> 05:00.762
A couple doesn't mean two.
It means two, three, 10, whatever.

05:00.933 --> 05:04.130
- Not 10.
- I'm not saying 10. Whatever.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.397
- Sometime between two and 10?
- Yes.

05:06.572 --> 05:07.561
When?

05:08.574 --> 05:10.804
- Closer to 10.
- No. Wrong.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.945
Then pick a number.
You think we're ready now?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.239
No, not now, but sometime soon.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.905
- Maybe.
- Maybe soon.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.075
When you say that,
it sounds so soon.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.447
This isn't working.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.920
We used to be together on this.
Suddenly you changed the rules on me.

05:25.091 --> 05:28.424
This isn't something I decided,
it's just something I'm starting to feel.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.494
Well, cut it out.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.596
Feel something else.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.758
Don't you think we should wait
until we both feel the same way?

05:36.936 --> 05:39.200
This thing takes confectionary sugar?

05:39.372 --> 05:41.772
- What is this?
- Regular sugar.

05:41.941 --> 05:44.000
- What's the difference?
- I don't know.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.813
That's why we couldn't have kids.
What if they ask us a question like that?

05:47.980 --> 05:51.074
- What are we gonna say?
- That's why we can't have kids?

05:51.284 --> 05:53.115
I want to know more.
I don't know any...

05:53.286 --> 05:55.686
When I was a kid,
my father knew everything.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.222
- Like what?
- He knew how to build a bench.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.223
He knew why the clouds move so quick.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.658
- Why do they?
- Something about the way they're made.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.592
- So you can learn that.
- Well, I haven't.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.361
- But you will.
- I'm just saying, don't rush me.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.471
- It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
- Hey, forget tomorrow.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.903
I'm saying, I want to start
talking about this.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.736
- We will.
- When?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.502
Maybe soon.

06:27.153 --> 06:32.250
It's a simple contract. Just use
the standard form, you'll be fine.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.685
I used to have the exact same one,
but in red.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.992
- I wasn't this good, but...
- Honey.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.493
We could use some bread here.
Hello?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.525
Ursula, some bread?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.403
Oh, no, thanks.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.339
- Not interested.
- Honey, that's not a toy.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.708
I'm just having lunch
with my brother and his wife.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.076
- And me.
- And Noah.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.047
- And me.
- And Lisa.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.584
Yeah, that's the one.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.153
Okay, okay. Bye.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.889
I'm so sorry, it's just so crazy.

07:10.263 --> 07:14.222
Two years married to my brother.
How does it feel?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.499
- I think the most wonderful thing...
- Oh, God, excuse me.

07:18.671 --> 07:22.038
- She's very busy.
- Hi, honey.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.039
Uncle Paul, how do they make crayons?

07:25.311 --> 07:26.403
How do they make crayons?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.710
You know how they get wax from bees?

07:29.882 --> 07:31.474
So it's the same kind of wax...

07:31.651 --> 07:36.384
...and they take that wax and they color it
with crayons they already have.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.057
Hey, Noah. Can you do this?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.224
You know what that is? Condensation.

07:46.899 --> 07:50.460
- You're making this up from nothing.
- He's not our kid.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.900
Honey, how can I? I have Noah.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.065
I want to sit next to Aunt Jamie.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.079
Did you schedule
the parent-teacher conference?

08:02.248 --> 08:03.738
No, that's next Wednesday.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.645
- Noah, want to play a game?
- Yeah.

08:07.820 --> 08:12.052
Okay, let's see how long we
can make our spoons be quiet.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.955
- I lose.
- Okay.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.965
Honey, we can't do it Saturday,
that's Ricky's birthday party.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.195
- I'm bored.
- Mingle.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.532
No, that's no good,
he's got Little League.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.302
- Billy Goodman called me a spaz.
- Are you a spaz?

08:31.477 --> 08:34.001
- No.
- So, what are you worried about?

08:35.114 --> 08:38.345
You know, I don't think that's
really helping right now.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.544
Honey, just call the school
and coordinate, please. Thank you.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.317
- I want to sit next to Uncle Paul.
- And who wouldn't, huh?

08:46.492 --> 08:48.585
And Aunt Jamie.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.129
- Why don't you slide over.
- Sure.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.288
No, I like to sit next to Jamie.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.567
You may sit next to Uncle Paul
and Aunt Jamie...

08:58.738 --> 09:01.400
...but you have to eat your hamburger.
- I'm not hungry.

09:01.574 --> 09:05.032
- You're gonna be hungry later.
- So get me a hamburger later.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.441
You are never going to Disney World.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.974
- How did you ever learn how to do this?
- My first kid.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.846
When are you guys gonna start trying?

09:14.020 --> 09:17.012
- Not for a while.
- Maybe soon.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.154
See the way he laughed when I put
the bread in my mouth like a walrus?

09:24.330 --> 09:26.298
I was very proud.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.491
That kid loves me. When the milk
comes out of their nose like that...

09:29.669 --> 09:31.603
That means they love you.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.137
No question about that.
I had a good time with Noah.

09:34.307 --> 09:40.177
- A Salisbury steak didn't land in your lap.
- That was your sister who threw that!

09:41.314 --> 09:45.375
What are you staring at?
You've never seen a couch?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.815
Call your mother and tell her
we're gonna be late.

09:47.987 --> 09:52.253
I don't want to call my mother.
She'll know from my voice I already ate.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.225
Who said you don't need arms, huh?

09:56.395 --> 10:00.297
Know what I think? Having a kid
is not going to be all that tough.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.867
Seriously. It's like Murray,
but with overalls.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.130
- Oh, my God!
- I don't think it's really that hard.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.740
Did you see what your sister
was going through?

10:09.909 --> 10:13.777
She didn't get to eat.
She has FAO Schwarz in her purse.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.311
Her hair is thinning.

10:15.681 --> 10:19.208
- Her hair is not thinning.
- It was thinning while we sat there.

10:19.385 --> 10:24.220
- You're the one who wants to have a kid.
- I said, I think I want to have a kid.

10:24.390 --> 10:29.225
- I didn't say that I know I wanted one.
- I'm just saying, keep thinking.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.135
All right, all right. Enough already.
Here, take the diaper bag.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.237
- I got it.
- That's the activity bag.

10:40.539 --> 10:44.236
Then somebody took a poop
in the activity bag.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.574
Walker, stroller, blankie,
highchair, car seat, porta-playpen...

10:48.748 --> 10:51.273
- Porta-playpen, isn't that in Spain?
- No.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.680
- You got the green horsy?
- I got it.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.378
- Ready to go to Grandma's?
- All ready.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.216
- Where's the baby?
- I'm not bringing the baby.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.916
We've got too much stuff.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.557
This is not exactly our only lunch today.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.166
- What? You're not hungry?
- It's just delicious.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.795
- Maybe you'd like mooshed potatoes?
- What's that?

11:14.974 --> 11:17.238
When he was little,
that's what he called them.

11:17.410 --> 11:21.972
"Ma, are we going to have mooshed
potatoes? I love mooshed potatoes.

11:22.148 --> 11:26.608
- Ma, can we have mooshed potatoes?"
- Ma, I think she gets it.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.449
- Pauly, look! The potato moosher.
- It's adorable.

11:30.723 --> 11:34.215
Yeah, moosh, moosh, moosh, moosh.

11:34.393 --> 11:37.362
Why don't you quit the floorshow
and sit down and eat something.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.353
I will, I will.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.161
I've never seen her sit at a meal.
Why do we have a chair for you?

11:43.335 --> 11:46.736
- Can I get you something else?
- I'm stuffed.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.364
How often do you get a good
home-cooked meal?

11:50.543 --> 11:54.104
- Ma, no kidding around, sit down.
- All right.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.840
Try it. Huh? What do you think?

11:59.318 --> 12:01.650
- What?
- Two years.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.112
- That's right.
- Who would've thought it?

12:04.290 --> 12:07.885
- We thought it.
- I was 19 when I married his father.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.789
How long before Paul was born?

12:10.796 --> 12:13.287
- Sharon was 2.
- Was he planned?

12:13.499 --> 12:18.630
- In what sense, honey?
- Did you decide to have kids, or...?

12:19.138 --> 12:21.231
Let's not go there.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.634
- What? I'm interested.
- Really?

12:24.810 --> 12:28.746
Well, actually, it was during
your father's vacation.

12:28.914 --> 12:32.077
- Back when he used to take vacations.
- Where did you go?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.448
Who could afford to go anywhere?
We were just getting started.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.886
We had just gotten this apartment.
We were each other's vacation.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.027
We'd go to Coney Island.
We'd go to the movies.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.630
We were kids. We didn't know
you had to go somewhere to have fun.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.288
Get to the part with me.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.059
We'd gone to see <i>Gigi</i> at the Loews...

12:52.238 --> 12:56.197
...and we were sitting here sharing
a frappe. I made my own hot fudge.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.643
Your father was doing his
Maurice Chevalier, like in the movie.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.580
- You know how I love Frenchmen.
- I actually don't, but go ahead.

13:08.788 --> 13:14.886
He was dancing around.
I was laughing, and...

13:16.262 --> 13:20.164
...that's when it happened.
Right here in the kitchen.

13:20.332 --> 13:24.132
- No!
- Yeah, I'm saying. On the table.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.771
I forgot to put out the coleslaw.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.638
- What do you mean? On this table?
- Yeah.

13:31.110 --> 13:35.137
- This table I've eaten at for 18 years?
- What? I didn't wipe it off?

13:36.549 --> 13:39.882
I wasn't allowed to put my elbows
on this table!

13:40.052 --> 13:41.883
It's rude!

13:50.896 --> 13:52.864
I've never seen so much food in my life.

13:53.032 --> 13:58.368
This is how I grew up. No meals,
just food until you lie down and cry.

13:59.872 --> 14:05.276
Murray, why do you put it in a place
that you're unable to retrieve it from?

14:05.444 --> 14:09.540
- What's wrong?
- My first two lunches just collided.

14:09.715 --> 14:13.811
- Where are you going?
- To put on my fat pants.

14:13.986 --> 14:19.982
You know what? I'm going to actually use
this belt-hole puncher.

14:21.594 --> 14:26.156
- I can't believe your mother.
- On the table they did it. Believe that?

14:26.332 --> 14:31.668
On the table. Now, for the rest of my life,
I will not be able to not know that.

14:31.837 --> 14:36.137
- Your mother is a striking woman.
- Where are you going with that?

14:36.308 --> 14:38.333
She's beautiful. You have her eyes.

14:39.545 --> 14:45.108
Maybe our kid will have my eyes
and your smile.

14:45.284 --> 14:49.653
- And my forehead.
- What's the matter with my forehead?

14:51.590 --> 14:54.024
- Nothing.
- Why shouldn't our kid have mine?

14:54.193 --> 14:56.320
Fine, he'll have your forehead.

14:56.495 --> 15:00.090
Your forehead, and your eyes,
and your smile. My ears, maybe.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.565
- Your ears are kind of droopy.
- Is that true? Are they really?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.398
It doesn't matter, because either way,
we're going to love it.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.735
<i>Love it, love it, love it, love it...</i>

15:12.344 --> 15:14.904
Moosh, moosh, moosh.

15:16.382 --> 15:20.148
- Honey?
- What a beautiful baby.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.050
Yeah, but, honey? He's a monkey.

15:27.059 --> 15:31.018
He's a beautiful monkey!

15:32.331 --> 15:35.198
I don't want to belabor the point...

15:35.367 --> 15:38.666
...and far be it for me
to speak ill of any child.

15:39.638 --> 15:43.540
- But he's a monkey.
- But he's our monkey.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.734
See, you're emphasizing the "our" part.

15:45.911 --> 15:49.847
I would like to highlight,
if I might, the monkey portion.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.415
- Our monkey.
- He's cute and he's smart.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.178
He can do a triple axel
off the jungle gym.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.790
That's all good. May God
strike me dead for saying this, but...

15:58.958 --> 16:03.054
- Every baby is beautiful.
- That's true. Yes, they are.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.128
But this one's a monkey!

16:14.740 --> 16:19.837
- I can't believe it's two years.
- Leave us alone with the two years.

16:20.012 --> 16:23.209
- When are you going to have kids?
- When are you going to get married?

16:25.050 --> 16:26.074
All right. Truce.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.352
- How are you doing, Ursula?
- Hi, Bill. Hi, Dave.

16:34.426 --> 16:38.362
Okay, once again. It's Ira. Paul.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.725
You guys crack me up!

16:42.267 --> 16:45.725
A couple of Rolling Rocks,
a club soda and a Zima.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.638
I'm curious.

16:49.308 --> 16:54.211
Things are so good between us, why
not? Then again, why mess with it?

16:54.380 --> 16:57.144
- Have a kid.
- What do you mean?

16:57.316 --> 16:58.806
- You've got to do it.
- Why?

16:58.984 --> 17:01.976
Like Europe, it's a big pain in the ass,
but you've got to do it.

17:06.692 --> 17:12.392
Sweet Richie is 4 years old. Norman
says it costs him 40 grand a year.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.994
Maybe the kid's embezzling from him.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.694
I'm serious, the kid goes through
over, like, 3 G's a month.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.704
He's got a nanny, a shrink,
he wears corrective shoes...

17:21.874 --> 17:24.866
...he goes to private school, he's got
some kind of allergy medication...

17:25.044 --> 17:27.979
...he goes to summer camp.
And dig this:

17:28.380 --> 17:31.110
He drives a Schwinn. That's not cheap.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.911
Forty grand a year for one kid.

17:34.086 --> 17:37.647
You can get them cheaper.
You gotta know where to go.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.783
Ursula, what's happening
with these drinks?

17:40.959 --> 17:44.053
- You guys were serious?
- What did you think?

17:44.463 --> 17:47.432
I thought you were pulling one of
your Bill-and-Dave things. Okay.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.174
Hey, Kim, what have you got
for nausea?

17:58.343 --> 18:02.006
Depends. You want to get nausea
or not get nausea?

18:03.348 --> 18:06.647
- Not.
- I got Pepto, Bromo, Alka-Seltzer.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.021
- Let's take all three. One for each lunch.
- There you go.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.781
Can you break a 50?

18:12.758 --> 18:13.884
I can get smaller.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.686
- What is it?
- It's my back.

18:15.861 --> 18:19.126
- Should I call the doctor?
- Where's Mark? He was a doctor.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.357
Sit down. Get something
we can use as a pillow.

18:22.968 --> 18:27.667
As a pillow? I got flour sacks,
I got marshmallows, I got paper towels.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.040
- Hey, you guys!
- Mark! Thank God!

18:31.210 --> 18:33.337
What's going on? Where does it hurt?

18:33.512 --> 18:35.139
- My back.
- You're probably in labor.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.576
- In her back?
- Yeah.

18:36.748 --> 18:40.343
Very often, labor pains are experienced
as severe back spasms, especially...

18:40.519 --> 18:45.081
...if the baby's in a posterior position.
- A regular delivery boy wouldn't know.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.958
- Should we get her to a hospital?
- No. You got hours.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.619
Kim, you know what you do?
Take her for a walk, relax.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.492
Go to a movie. Play with her nipples.

18:53.665 --> 18:58.329
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- No, no. It stimulates labor.

18:58.504 --> 19:02.133
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.640
Was that true about the nipples?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.679
- How do you know that?
- A friend of mine...

19:10.849 --> 19:13.181
...her doctor told her husband
to bring her to orgasm.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.910
- Oh, jeez.
- What?

19:15.087 --> 19:18.352
Like the guy doesn't have
enough things on his mind?

19:23.962 --> 19:26.897
Hey, Jamie.
Is this a tomato or what?

19:27.065 --> 19:31.263
- It's a beauty.
- Yeah, tomato. What a great idea.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.507
Congratulations!

19:38.710 --> 19:41.235
I have a market, I have a wife,
I have a daughter.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.813
- A baby girl!
- Hello!

19:45.117 --> 19:49.053
- This is Rose.
- She's beautiful.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.122
- Your husband was just here.
- He was?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.919
He came by to see the baby,
but she was sleeping.

19:57.462 --> 20:00.124
- Here.
- Really?

20:06.572 --> 20:09.006
- How many years did you go to college?
- Four.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.267
- And med school?
- Four.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.934
- How long were you an intern?
- One year.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.909
- And then a resident?
- Two.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.208
Good. Give me a pound of grapes.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.756
- I'm gonna go see the baby.
- Jamie's inside.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.129
Look what I got.

20:32.297 --> 20:36.131
- This must be Rose.
- Isn't she sweet?

20:36.301 --> 20:39.134
You're a very, very tiny person there.

20:40.439 --> 20:45.342
Smell that. I love that baby smell.

20:45.544 --> 20:50.811
- So you were here before?
- Yeah. I stopped to smell the rose.

20:53.151 --> 20:57.053
- You look very good with one of these.
- I do?

20:57.222 --> 20:58.746
Hi, Rose.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.652
I think she wants you.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.454
You handle most of the complaint calls,
don't you?

21:07.065 --> 21:10.432
Bye, Rose.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.405
Come on.

21:14.573 --> 21:18.304
- You think we should buy something?
- For what? Just for sport?

21:18.477 --> 21:22.436
I think it's rude to just come, hold
their baby, and not buy anything.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.879
You're a very nice person
is who you are.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.576
- Honey?
- Coming.

21:31.290 --> 21:37.627
Triple Chocolate Chunky Chip. That's
just a flavor for the sake of being one.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.794
I want to be pregnant.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.829
Listen, you let me know
if there's anything I can do for you.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.037
I will.

21:46.204 --> 21:52.074
- Any idea when I'll be getting this call?
- I'm not exactly sure.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.338
- Tell me again why I'd be doing this?
- Because you're in love with me.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.141
That's what it is.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.940
Of course. Sure.
