[trumpeting]

00:47.798 --> 00:50.718
That dreaded time of year,
dating all the way back

00:50.801 --> 00:53.220
to the days
of King Julien the Terrible,

00:53.303 --> 00:56.348
when we feed the Gorch to prevent it
from crawling out,

00:56.431 --> 00:59.393
tearing us to pieces,
and feasting on our meaty parts.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.604
Gorch, anything you'd like to say
to the fearful public?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.439
[roaring]

01:04.523 --> 01:06.441
You heard it here first, folks.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.904
That can only mean one thing.
It's feeding time.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.030
[trumpeting]

01:11.112 --> 01:14.115
Ooh! Here comes King Julien now!

01:14.199 --> 01:15.784
[cheering]

01:15.993 --> 01:19.496
It is my honor to present
our one and only fearless leader,

01:19.580 --> 01:22.750
appeaser of the Gorch,
master of the entire universe--

01:22.833 --> 01:26.503
-Did you write this?
-Yeah, really good, right? Keep going!

01:26.628 --> 01:29.339
And bringer of all
that is good and awesome.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.090
King Julien!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.593
[cheering]

01:32.760 --> 01:36.179
He will now commence the feeding
by throwing out the first fruit.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.849
I thought the Gorch
was a made-up jungle legend,

01:38.933 --> 01:40.976
like Bigfoot or the Golden Mango,

01:41.060 --> 01:43.771
or childhood dreams
that don't end in tears.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.981
Practice your throwing, Your Majesty?

01:46.065 --> 01:52.320
Maurice, please. No practice needed.
I've got mad skills. Fruit me, Clover.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.895
Are all of these fruits defective?

02:25.062 --> 02:28.189
I'll find you the perfect fruit.
Got it!

02:29.232 --> 02:32.778
Good throw, King Julien!

02:32.861 --> 02:36.490
Ha! In your face, Maurice!
Where's all your "practice" talk now?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.034
Your Majesty, you just fed Mort
to the Gorch!

02:39.118 --> 02:40.201
We gotta save him!

02:40.285 --> 02:43.038
Don't be so hasty, Clo-Clo.

-A wise king must consider all... options.
-Oh!

02:47.793 --> 02:49.128
Breaking news.

02:49.210 --> 02:53.007
All eyes are on King Julien,
urging him to action.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.760
Will he or won't he risk life and limb
to save Mort,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.971
one of our own who's fallen?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.639
[feedback from mic]

03:00.722 --> 03:02.599
[sighs] Okay.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.642
Let's go.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.104

03:08.730 --> 03:09.857
Mort!

Why is the floor, like, crunchy?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.369
Ah! Thousands of creepy crawly

Quick, give her a cookie, Maurice!

03:46.393 --> 03:47.895
[munching]

03:49.354 --> 03:53.274
Did we hold the bridge, Lieutenant?
Wait, what? How long was I out?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.360
Eh, let's just keep moving.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.864
Uh... Huh?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.201
We're getting close to the Gorch!

04:02.283 --> 04:04.203

04:13.420 --> 04:15.422

04:16.090 --> 04:17.549
Oh, that was me.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.467
[screams] Okay, I'm done now.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.637
It's all right, King Julien.
It's just a really old lemur.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.514
What brings you 'round these parts?

04:24.681 --> 04:28.894
Uh, buddy, you might want to rethink
your living situation.

04:28.977 --> 04:32.189
Didn't anyone tell you,
the Gorch lives down here?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.775
-What's a Gorch?
-A monster.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.568
No monsters in here.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.571
Just little ol' me.
Friends call me Doc Sugarfoot.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.281
Eh... [blows]

04:41.364 --> 04:42.950
What are you doing down here?

04:43.033 --> 04:46.912
Long time back, I hid in this here cave
during a foosa attack,

04:47.121 --> 04:49.581
but I got my tail pinned
under this rock.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.585
Been hollerin' for help ever since,
but I guess no one heard me.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.131
-Oh, my-- He's the Gorch!
-[both] Huh?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.506
It was him the whole time!

04:58.673 --> 05:02.010
-How long have you been in here?
-Decades, I reckon.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.972
Luckily, someone's been
throwing fruit down.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.641
Kept me alive and gave me enough strength

05:07.724 --> 05:10.978
to try to hack off my own tail
with a sharpened rock.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.480
But dang it if I don't have a tough tail.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.690
Built up a real big scar, though.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.609
-Wanna see?
-No, thanks.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.236
-Hardcore.
-Yeah.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.655
-[flies buzzing]
-Respect, old guy. Respeck.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.951
Well, my grandma always said,
"You gotta make hay while the sun shines."

05:27.077 --> 05:30.497
That reminds me,
is that little guy with you?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.042
Must eat something!
The hunger...

05:34.126 --> 05:35.376
The hunger!

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
[munching]

05:36.962 --> 05:39.338
Mort, you've been down here
for ten minutes.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.092
Your tail isn't even trapped
under a rock.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.804
[laughs mischievously]

05:46.221 --> 05:48.140
Now, I don't want to brag,

05:48.223 --> 05:51.392
but I went down
into a deep, dark, scary hole

05:51.476 --> 05:54.146
to save one lemur
and ended up saving two!

05:54.271 --> 05:55.689
[cheering]

05:55.856 --> 05:58.817
Allow me to introduce the Gorch.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.361
[guffawing]

06:02.529 --> 06:03.738
[screaming]

06:03.947 --> 06:06.325
We're all gonna die for sure!

06:06.825 --> 06:09.744
Now, now, friends.
No need to be afraid.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.497
After all, if you keep going
the way you're headed,

06:12.580 --> 06:15.709
-pretty soon you're gonna get there.
-Good point!

06:15.876 --> 06:17.585
My name's Doc Sugarfoot.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.504
It feels good to be back.

06:19.587 --> 06:23.217
Been away a long time.
My old friends are all gone now.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.469
I look out at you,
and all I see is strangers.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.932
But Mama always said, "A stranger
is just a friend wearing a raincoat."

06:31.016 --> 06:33.727
And I'd like you all
to take off your raincoats

06:33.810 --> 06:35.770
and step under my umbrella.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.356
-So true!
-How wise!

06:37.480 --> 06:39.358
He must have a big umbrella!

06:39.524 --> 06:41.442
What do you think of Doc Sugarfoot?

06:41.526 --> 06:45.864
[stutters] He's so old.
And old people know stuff, yeah.

06:46.031 --> 06:50.077
He smells dusty.
So, he's gotta be really wise.

06:50.202 --> 06:55.165
Think of all the great stuff he's seen
by not being dead. I mean, wow.

06:55.374 --> 06:59.127
He's got great hair. Makes me
want to hug the heck right out of him!

06:59.211 --> 07:01.213
He is just so huggable! Aha!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.715
Mm-hmm... Ha.

07:03.798 --> 07:04.716
Wow!

07:04.799 --> 07:07.677
The people are really
loving Doc Sugarfoot.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.222
I wish they'd show me that much adoration.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.223
Oh! Oh!

07:11.306 --> 07:15.852
I think I'm... Yes, I'm having an idea!
To increase adoration for me,

07:15.936 --> 07:18.313
I'll exploit the goodwill
toward Doc Sugarfoot

07:18.397 --> 07:20.065
and make him my royal adviser.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.150
But, but... I'm your royal adviser.

07:22.359 --> 07:27.030
And you will continue to be, Mo-Mo.
You'll just have a little folksy help now.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.617
Attention, peoples!
I have an announcement.

07:30.700 --> 07:35.205
Doc Sugarfoot is going to be
part of my royal counsel.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.374
[cheering]

07:39.209 --> 07:40.961
[chuckles sinisterly]

07:41.128 --> 07:42.129
Huh?

07:42.796 --> 07:46.383
And so I said to Dorothy,
"I have pottery lessons on Tuesday

07:46.549 --> 07:47.801
and improv on Thursday.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.178
Why couldn't Wednesday be taco night?"

07:50.345 --> 07:52.764
Mm... Good point, Ted.

07:52.847 --> 07:57.436
What if we change all Tuesdays
into Wednesdays?

07:57.602 --> 08:00.355
Hm... I guess that could work.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.358
Ted, when I was alone in that hole,

08:03.442 --> 08:05.110
I found comfort in the fact

08:05.193 --> 08:08.280
that it's easier to stew
than stay cool.

08:08.447 --> 08:11.283
I know exactly what you mean,
Doc Sugarfoot.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.286
What? Hold up, Ted.
You understood that?

08:14.453 --> 08:15.412
Of course!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.081
Uh, okay, one quick thing,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.167
I know you're fresh out of a hole,

08:20.250 --> 08:23.295
but the king usually does the talking.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.213
Oh, sure thing, Julien.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.299
Sorry about that.
I got carried away.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.759
Horst! What up, homeslice?

08:29.926 --> 08:33.013
Some kids keep stealing my beverage cup.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.308
I want you to arrest them
and have them fed to the foosa.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.976
Sounds completely reasonable--

08:38.059 --> 08:41.480
But, you know, Horst, back in my day
we had a saying,

08:41.562 --> 08:45.984
"If you butter your biscuit on the bottom,
all you get is a soggy paw."

08:46.151 --> 08:50.280
Gee, I didn't think of it like that.
Thanks, Doc Sugarfoot!

08:50.364 --> 08:52.991
-Ah, uh!
-[imitating grave sounds]

08:53.200 --> 08:56.328
Well, I say real life is
when you chew on a truth biscuit

08:56.495 --> 08:58.872
and it tells you a yarn or two.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.915
I love yarn.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.543
Yeah. So yarny, right, King Julien?

09:03.710 --> 09:07.422
Uh, call me crazy,
but I thought real life

09:07.547 --> 09:09.632
was what I see
in front of my face!

09:09.716 --> 09:11.843
Not in some biscuit full of string.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.554
-Yarn.
-I don't care! Eat whatever you want!

09:14.971 --> 09:17.474
You'll have to pardon my dusty old wisdom.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.477
See, when I was alone
in the bottom of that hole--

09:20.560 --> 09:23.313
Okay, I've had it up to here
with you and your hole!

09:23.480 --> 09:26.649
-[all gasp]
-I have two royal advisers, you know.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.110
-Maurice!
-I'm right here, Your Majesty.

09:29.194 --> 09:33.198
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Have you always been this short?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.991
Somehow I thought you were taller.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.660
Anyway, tell Doc Sugarfoot here

09:37.744 --> 09:42.665
how I've had just about all I need
of his dusty old wisdoms.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.044
Now, now, no need to get
your hackles up, young Julien.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.171
This isn't a popularity contest.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.131
Unless that's what you want.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.592
[dramatic organ music playing]

09:52.967 --> 09:56.846
Mort! Stop that! Go practice
your organ someplace else!

09:56.930 --> 09:59.182
A popularity contest?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.894
Why would you say that?
You think I wouldn't win?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.063
Who thinks King Julien
is the most popular?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.481
Just out of curiosity.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.150
Me! I do! Love that guy!

10:09.234 --> 10:11.445
So popular it makes me sick!

10:11.528 --> 10:12.362
[retches]

10:12.529 --> 10:14.614
See? The public has spoken.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.866
[laughs maliciously]

10:16.991 --> 10:19.369
No. I'm talking about an election.

Most popular lemur

10:22.747 --> 10:25.875
Fine! Let's do this "election" thing

10:26.000 --> 10:29.254
and prove once and for all
that my people love me

10:29.421 --> 10:31.214
and everything I do for them!

10:31.298 --> 10:33.841
Your Majesty, this is not a good idea.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.096
Don't worry, Maurice. I'm king.
I can't lose.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.015
It's what they call
"political correctness."

10:41.516 --> 10:44.144
King Julien, that's not
how an election works.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.606
If you lose, you're not king anymore.
Doc Sugarfoot is.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.773
Oh!

10:49.065 --> 10:49.899
Oh.

10:51.025 --> 10:51.943
Oh...

10:57.365 --> 11:00.910
[panting]

11:01.911 --> 11:03.871
Faster, Mort! It helps me think.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.583
[panting heavily]

11:07.834 --> 11:11.212
Oh, King Julien, look!
Tomorrow's newspaper.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.007
They went ahead and
printed the headline to save time.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.343
King Julien, please tell me
you have a plan.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.637
Stop!

11:18.803 --> 11:19.929
[grunts]

11:20.305 --> 11:21.889
Even better, Maurice.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.642
I have three plans.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.977
First, I need campaign posters.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.480
Something that shows
what a people person I am.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.815
-Mort, get started.
-On it. Oh!

11:31.358 --> 11:34.528
Two. Xixi, I will do an interview
on your show.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.156
Let the people see exactly
why it is that they love me.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.366
On it!

11:39.533 --> 11:41.826
What can I do, King Julien?
Put me to work!

11:41.993 --> 11:44.329
I'm leaving you two in charge of...

11:44.496 --> 11:48.458
super top secret emergency plan C.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.792
What is it?

11:50.335 --> 11:53.296
Dig up dirt on Doc Sugarfoot
to ruin his reputation

11:53.380 --> 11:56.257
and make everyone hate him
so they'll vote for me.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.551
[both] On it!

11:57.716 --> 12:00.220
My next guest is the King of Madagascar,

12:00.303 --> 12:01.888
the Prince of Parties,

12:01.971 --> 12:04.849
the Archduke of Good Times,
the Comptroller of--

12:04.932 --> 12:06.393
Okay! They get it, Xixi!

12:06.476 --> 12:10.313
Er, um, please welcome King Julien!

12:10.605 --> 12:12.566
[cheering]

12:12.731 --> 12:15.443
King Julien, we're all dying to know,

12:15.527 --> 12:18.697
is the jungle a better place
with you on the throne?

12:18.779 --> 12:21.908
Glad you asked, Xixi.
In a word, yes.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.869
Think of all the parties
and good times we've had

12:24.952 --> 12:27.872
since I squashed
Uncle King Julien's reign of fear

12:27.955 --> 12:30.124
and saved you all from the foosa.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.626
[cheering]

12:32.043 --> 12:33.461
And what will you do if elected?

12:33.628 --> 12:37.965
Oh, you know, more of the same
awesome stuff I've been doing.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.719
More parties. More water-slides. More fun!

12:41.052 --> 12:41.886
[cheering]

12:41.969 --> 12:44.180
And now, a word from our sponsor.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.850
[creaking]

12:48.059 --> 12:50.311
I'm just an old-fashioned lemur.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.314
I've got a homey accent
and this here rocking chair.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.109
But my opponent is one
of those fancy types.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.820
He's got a funny way of talking
like he had lots of schooling.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.240
And he doesn't even own a rocking chair.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.491
[all gasp]

13:03.658 --> 13:05.660
But don't take my word for it.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.288
He's out of touch with regular lemurs.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.625
He abandoned all 20 of his children!

13:11.708 --> 13:12.626
[gasping]

13:12.791 --> 13:16.003
What? That's just crazy!
Those aren't my babies!

13:16.087 --> 13:19.132
-They look nothing like me.
-Are these paid actors?

13:19.215 --> 13:21.676
Probably. Are their stories true?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.262
Who knows?
But imagine if they were.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.264
So, vote for me, Doc Sugarfoot.

13:26.347 --> 13:32.061
A strong leader who will unite all lemurs
under one total power, me.

13:33.854 --> 13:38.067
And remember, King Julien,
out of touch, child abandoner,

13:38.276 --> 13:40.320
educated, no rocking chair.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.197
I'm Doc Sugarfoot
and I approve this message.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.702
Doc Sugarfoot has made
some startling accusations.

13:47.786 --> 13:48.745
Your response?

13:48.827 --> 13:51.247
[stammers] It's not true, Xixi.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.082
I do own a rocking chair.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.710
And trust me, I know how to rock it.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.378
[grunting]

13:57.462 --> 13:58.463
[male lemur] My eye!

13:58.546 --> 14:00.674
Trying to kill us
with his fake rocking chair!

14:00.757 --> 14:02.467
-What a phony!
-I'm not a phony.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.885
I am a real-ie!

14:05.052 --> 14:07.639
Doc Sugarfoot's the phony
and I'll prove it.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.935
Doc Sugarfoot, I challenge you
to a debate!

14:13.394 --> 14:14.937
Challenge accepted.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.192
Come on, Hector.
You're the oldest lemur around.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.944
You've gotta know
something about Doc Sugarfoot.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.822
I just want to be left alone.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.492
I'm grabbing my nuts and getting
as far away from here as possible.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.828
-Why?
-Look, I don't have time

14:29.910 --> 14:32.372
to be talking to the likes of you.
So, buzz off!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.166
[karate yells]

14:35.416 --> 14:38.127
Unless you want this whole place
smothered in nut-butter,

14:38.252 --> 14:41.214
-tell us what you know.
-Do your worst!

14:41.297 --> 14:44.175
I'm a lot more scared of him
than I am of you.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.177
He was in that cave for a reason!

14:46.761 --> 14:48.513
I've said too much.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.514
The cave!

14:49.930 --> 14:52.058
Bring it in, Mort. Bring it in.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.768
[grunting]

14:53.852 --> 14:55.562
Okay, let me see.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.440
[snickering]

15:00.107 --> 15:02.235
This isn't what I asked for!

15:02.402 --> 15:05.154
But, look how big you are!

15:05.321 --> 15:08.658
I'm trying to seem more relatable
to the little guy.

15:08.742 --> 15:12.119
Why would you draw me literally
stomping on the little guy?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.539
But look, the little guy's smiling.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.167
'Cause he getting stomped on
by your giant, perfect,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.961
oh, so-beautiful feet.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.506
Uh, come here you!

15:23.590 --> 15:25.966
[exclaiming]

15:26.718 --> 15:28.595
[sighs] You can have it, Mort.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.139
[laughing]

15:32.348 --> 15:33.266
Where is Xixi?

15:33.683 --> 15:34.517
[groans]

15:35.643 --> 15:38.772
There you are! Time's a-ticking!
Bring the debate questions?

15:38.855 --> 15:41.148
-I need to practice!
-Yes. But...

15:41.232 --> 15:44.694
Won't going over them with you first
give you an unfair advantage?

15:44.903 --> 15:48.989
Advantage, yes. Unfair?
This is politics, grow up!

15:49.073 --> 15:50.533
King Julien?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.494
What happens if Doc Sugarfoot
wins the debate?

15:54.412 --> 15:57.540
Then we go to emergency plan C.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.334
[dramatic music playing]

16:03.170 --> 16:07.174
Maurice, look! There's a message
carved on the back of the rock.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.219
"Do not lift rock.
This is the worst lemur ever.

16:10.303 --> 16:14.181
He must stay here.
Don't believe us? Look up."

16:16.935 --> 16:18.770
King Julien the Terrible.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.354
Who's King Julien the Terrible?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.649
[Maurice] The worst lemur ever.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.193
Many years ago,
he ruled with fear and intimidation.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.071
Nearly drove the entire kingdom
to extinction.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.490
Until the people fought back.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.075
According to these cave paintings,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.536
they stopped him, tied him up,

16:35.703 --> 16:37.497
and put him here under this rock.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.749
[growls]

16:39.958 --> 16:43.002
So that means, Doc Sugarfoot is--

16:43.127 --> 16:46.130
-King Julien the Terrible!
-We gotta warn everybody!

16:46.213 --> 16:48.758
[Doc] No. That won't be happening.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.135
Like my papa always used to say,

16:51.302 --> 16:54.806
"A hound dog that sticks his nose
where it doesn't belong

16:54.889 --> 16:57.809
ends up getting crushed by a boulder."

16:57.976 --> 16:58.935
[grunts]

16:59.226 --> 17:00.353
[gasping]

17:00.645 --> 17:03.189
[both grunting]

17:04.774 --> 17:05.775
[groans]

17:06.025 --> 17:08.319
Go on without me, Clover!

17:08.402 --> 17:10.070
Hi-ya! We can make it.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.156
[panting and groaning]

17:12.490 --> 17:13.533
Look!

17:14.158 --> 17:15.159
[both gasp]

17:15.576 --> 17:16.452
Ugh...

17:16.536 --> 17:21.207
Clover, I got a confession to make.
I can't swim. Or dive. I hate heights.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.083
And seafood gives me the squirts.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.212
[exclaiming and screaming]

17:27.463 --> 17:28.673
[screaming]

17:31.551 --> 17:33.177
[imitating grave sounds]

17:33.344 --> 17:36.014
[trumpeting]

17:36.931 --> 17:39.475
Well, folks, it's election day!

17:39.559 --> 17:44.022
It's been a heated competition between two
of the kingdom's most electable bachelors.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.356
[cheering]

17:45.439 --> 17:49.861
Before the kingdom votes, let's hear
some final remarks from each candidate.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.820
Doc Sugarfoot?

17:51.029 --> 17:55.575
I'll make this nice and short.
Back porch. Overalls. Huckleberry.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.827
-Uh...
-[cheering]

17:58.036 --> 17:59.829
Seriously, you guys?

17:59.913 --> 18:02.373
He just said three random words.

18:02.540 --> 18:06.669
I can do that! Karate. Sasquatch. Cabbage.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.172
-Sasquatch?
-What the heck is he talking about?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.424
Why does he do this?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.884
[booing]

18:13.384 --> 18:15.219
-Really?
-Thank you, King Julien.

18:15.386 --> 18:19.849
Whoa-whoa! That was totally not my real
final remarks! Do-over?

18:20.099 --> 18:24.478
Well, that's not normally allowed
under the election rules,

18:24.562 --> 18:27.690
but since I'm making them up
as I go, I'll allow it.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.069
King Julien, your final,
final remarks, please.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.030
Where are Clover and Maurice
with the dirt?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.157
I don't know.
I live in my own world.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.534
[Xixi] King Julien?

18:40.870 --> 18:41.913
[sighs]

18:42.872 --> 18:44.665
I don't have all of the answers.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.795
To be honest, I've failed as much
as I've succeeded.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.338
But I love my kingdom.

18:51.422 --> 18:55.676
And if I'm elected, I will work
tirelessly to keep you safe

18:55.760 --> 18:58.805
and inspire you to live
each day to the fullest.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.141
Help me help you!

19:02.224 --> 19:03.101
[crickets chirping]

19:03.267 --> 19:04.644
[whimpering]

19:04.852 --> 19:06.395
And one more thing...

19:06.479 --> 19:07.438
Emergency Plan D!

19:07.688 --> 19:10.566
[chattering and calling]

19:10.733 --> 19:12.485
[exclaiming in annoyance]

19:12.735 --> 19:13.778
What?

19:13.903 --> 19:16.530
[imitates record scratching]

19:16.990 --> 19:19.033
I think we've all heard enough.
Let's vote.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.994
Really? Because you haven't heard--

19:21.077 --> 19:23.579
[cackling and howling]

19:23.788 --> 19:25.873
[exclaiming] This is my favorite.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.249
It goes a little something like--

19:27.333 --> 19:31.004
[screaming]

19:31.337 --> 19:33.339
It's clear the king is stalling.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.215
Sta-stalling?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.759
[laughs hysterically]

19:36.968 --> 19:39.012
That's ridiculous!

19:40.346 --> 19:41.305
[plays chord]

19:41.388 --> 19:42.723
I'm taking requests.

19:42.807 --> 19:46.310
Anybody want a long song I can play
a bunch of times in a row?

19:46.393 --> 19:50.731
If you're waiting for help to arrive,
you're gonna be waiting a long time.

19:50.815 --> 19:51.732
[Maurice] Or not!

19:51.899 --> 19:53.026
Everybody listen!

19:54.110 --> 19:57.237
Doc Sugarfoot!
He's none other than...

19:57.321 --> 19:58.656
[snoring]

19:59.532 --> 20:00.700
Who is...

20:00.783 --> 20:02.201
[snoring]

20:03.410 --> 20:06.706
[panting] No! Doc Sugarfoot!
He's King Julien the Terrible!

20:06.789 --> 20:09.792
That cave was his prison cell
and we let him out!

20:09.917 --> 20:10.793
[all gasping]

20:10.877 --> 20:11.836
-[lemur exclaiming]
-[thuds]

20:12.003 --> 20:15.756
King Julien the Terrible.
What an exciting new development.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.385
According to legend,
he was quite the monster.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.428
He used to eat baby lemurs for breakfast

20:21.512 --> 20:23.472
and pick his teeth with their eyebrows!

20:23.639 --> 20:25.224
We're all really gonna die!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.560
[all screaming]

20:27.768 --> 20:31.981
Did I forget to mention that?
Calm down, everyone. It's all true.

20:32.065 --> 20:35.109
I'm King Julien the Terrible.
I'm not denying it.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.570
A catfish can't deny
his breathing underwater.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.655
He's right. They have gills.

20:39.822 --> 20:43.617
Now maybe I was responsible
for a few thousand lemur deaths.

20:43.701 --> 20:47.121
But should I apologize for being strong?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.207
[all exclaiming] Yeah!

20:49.665 --> 20:53.293
Do you want a feeble ruler
who just wants to be loved by everyone?

20:53.753 --> 20:56.296
Or do you want a doer?
A decider!

20:56.463 --> 21:00.593
Yeah! So what if he's a vicious dictator?
He knows what he wants!

21:00.676 --> 21:04.471
-He nearly wiped out our people!
-And never admitted he was wrong!

21:04.555 --> 21:06.599
Now, that's strong leadership!

21:06.682 --> 21:08.684
A strong leader sounds great!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.603
I still wanna hug him!

21:10.686 --> 21:11.979
Yeah, me, too!

21:12.063 --> 21:13.355
[guitar riff]

21:13.439 --> 21:14.232
...really wise.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.650
[crickets chirping]

21:17.443 --> 21:19.612
Oh, that's it. Fine!

21:19.695 --> 21:23.241
Ah! Just... Ah!
I am so done with this.

21:23.407 --> 21:28.495
Do you want good King Julien
who just wants everybody to be happy?

21:29.830 --> 21:30.748
[exclaiming excitedly]

21:30.915 --> 21:35.920
Or do you want a king who literally
has the word "terrible" in his name?

21:37.421 --> 21:39.757
The gods and the peoples have spoken.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.759
[laughs maliciously]

21:41.968 --> 21:44.929
At last. I'm king again!

21:45.179 --> 21:47.140
[laughs maniacally]

21:47.306 --> 21:48.432
[thunderclaps]

21:48.515 --> 21:50.184
Ooh! Lightning.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.769
[all scream]

21:52.270 --> 21:56.649
I want each of you to look to the lemur
to your left, then to your right.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.861
By this time next week
one of you will be dead!

22:02.529 --> 22:04.865
Not me, though, right? I'm safe?

22:05.032 --> 22:06.366
The jungle's gonna burn.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.452
The weak shall perish.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.664
And all will bow down before me.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.873
Suckers!

22:12.999 --> 22:14.250
[laughs maliciously]

22:15.126 --> 22:16.002
[exclaims]

22:16.085 --> 22:16.961
[coughs]

22:17.128 --> 22:17.962
[all gasping]

22:18.712 --> 22:19.546
[laughing]

22:19.755 --> 22:22.133
You think a little lightning's
gonna stop me?

22:22.216 --> 22:23.092
[poof]

22:24.218 --> 22:25.052
[all gasping]

22:26.929 --> 22:28.889
I think he's dead, Your Majesty.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.266
Oh...

22:30.348 --> 22:31.851
Democracy in action!

22:31.934 --> 22:35.395
Well, looks like I'm king again.
All hail me!

22:35.479 --> 22:38.191
-[laughing]
-[all cheering]

22:38.274 --> 22:40.276
Ha-ha! Dead guy! [laughs]

22:40.442 --> 22:42.360
[dance music plays]
