07:34.287 --> 07:36.664
{\an8}- YES, THAT IS SITUATION.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.799

{\an8}- NO, NO, HE WAS JUST
A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.104
{\an8}A LITTLE WILD, YOU KNOW.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.564
{\an8}- VINNY, WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.565

08:12.700 --> 08:14.202
{\an8}- YUP.

08:14.285 --> 08:14.994
{\an8}TO SAY THE LEAST.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.871
{\an8}[laughter]

08:27.757 --> 08:29.342
{\an8}- ANGELINA IS ACTUALLY
STILL SLEEPING.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.928
{\an8}- SLEEPING?

08:32.010 --> 08:32.929
{\an8}- OKAY. NO PROBLEM.

08:33.011 --> 08:33.929
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.847
{\an8}LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.770
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG

08:41.854 --> 08:44.732
{\an8}BESIDES COMING HOME

08:44.815 --> 08:46.400
{\an8}YO, YOU KNOW, ANGELINA'S GONNA
SAY SOMETHING TO HER.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.818
{\an8}- TRY TO GET ON HER GOOD SIDE.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.154
{\an8}THAT'S GONNA BE THE THING
THAT SHE'S GONNA USE,

08:50.238 --> 08:51.113
{\an8}THE TOOL.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.490
{\an8}- SAMMI WAS EAVESDROPPING
ON US.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.450
{\an8}- WAS SHE?

08:54.533 --> 08:55.785
{\an8}- SHE'S LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT?
WAIT, WHAT?"

08:55.868 --> 08:57.370
{\an8}- "WAIT, WHAT?"
- "WAIT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?"

08:57.453 --> 08:59.622
{\an8}- OH, MAN, I'M JUST GONNA
TELL HER, I THINK.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.124
{\an8}- I THINK THAT WOULD BE
THE EASIEST WAY.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.376
{\an8}- [stammering]

09:03.459 --> 09:04.961
{\an8}I'M GONNA LIE
ABOUT THE KISSING,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.504
{\an8}BUT I'M GONNA BE LIKE, "YEAH,
I WAS DANCING WITH GIRLS."

09:06.587 --> 09:07.630
{\an8}- YEAH.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.631
{\an8}I'LL BE LIKE, YO,
ASK THEM.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.466
{\an8}ANGELINA'S LYING
ABOUT THE KISSING.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.634
{\an8}IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.011
{\an8}- NO, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING
AS KISSING.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.054
{\an8}- I'M NOT GONNA TELL SAM
WHAT I DID

09:15.137 --> 09:16.514
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA START
A WAR.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.140
{\an8}I'M GONNA DENY,
DENY, DENY

09:18.224 --> 09:19.183
{\an8}UNTIL ANGELINA SAYS SOMETHING

09:19.267 --> 09:20.643
{\an8}AND IT GETS CONFIRMED

09:20.726 --> 09:22.812
{\an8}AND [bleep] WORLD WAR III
STARTS.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.272
{\an8}IF SHE ASKS ME AGAIN,
I'M GONNA BE LIKE,

09:24.355 --> 09:26.148
{\an8}YO, I DANCED
WITH, LIKE, ONE OR TWO GIRLS.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.608
{\an8}IT WASN'T EVEN ANYTHING SERIOUS.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.655
{\an8}- WHERE IS THIS PLACE?
- I SEE--

09:32.738 --> 09:33.906
{\an8}- I THINK IT'S CALLED
FUNKY SEX STORE.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.241
{\an8}- SHOPPING HERE IN MIAMI
IS, LIKE, COOL.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.953
{\an8}THEY HAVE DIFFERENT, LIKE,
KIND OF STYLES THAN AT JERSEY.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.663
{\an8}FUNKY? THERE IT IS.
FUNKY, FUNKY.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.665
{\an8}WE WENT TO, LIKE,
A TRANNY SHOP.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.167
{\an8}'CAUSE THERE WAS HOT,
LIKE, CLUB CLOTHES

09:45.251 --> 09:46.127
{\an8}THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

09:46.210 --> 09:47.837
{\an8}EVERYTHING TRANNIES
WOULD WEAR.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.506
{\an8}- THESE ARE VERY UNIQUE STYLES,
I FEEL.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.924
{\an8}- WAIT, ARE THESE
FOR BOOBS?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.969
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.
- I'M GONNA--I WANNA WEAR THIS.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.304
{\an8}- [gasps]

09:56.387 --> 09:57.179
{\an8}- THIS IS THE--
- IS THIS THE TOP?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.473
{\an8}- THIS IS THE TOP, RIGHT?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.059
{\an8}UNLESS YOU PUT YOUR LEGS
THROUGH.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.562
{\an8}- THE SEX SHOP IS PERFECT.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.688
{\an8}PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.315
{\an8}- TRY IT ON.
I WANT TO SEE IT.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.900
{\an8}- IT'S MY SCENE,
AND WHEN I GET INTO MY SCENE,

10:09.984 --> 10:10.901
{\an8}I GET INTO MY CLOTHES.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
{\an8}- LET ME SEE.
- LET ME SEE.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.196
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE,
ONE WRONG MOVE,

10:14.280 --> 10:15.573
{\an8}YOUR WHOLE BOOB'S
GONNA HANG OUT.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.700
{\an8}- FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BE
IN A RAP VIDEO.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.577
{\an8}- WOW.
- THE GLASSES ARE PRETTY MUCH

10:19.660 --> 10:20.077
{\an8}ALL CRYSTALLED OUT,

10:20.161 --> 10:22.246
{\an8}ALL BLING-BLING.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.748
{\an8}BUT IF I GET PULLED OVER,

10:23.831 --> 10:25.207
{\an8}I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE
FOR THESE.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.208
{\an8}BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON,
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.210
{\an8}SO I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DRIVE WITH THEM,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.087
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU'LL GET A TICKET.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.339
{\an8}OH, GOD,
HOW MUCH ARE THE GLASSES?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.548
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME
RIGHT NOW.

10:32.631 --> 10:33.841
{\an8}SO I HAD TO GET THE GLASSES.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.968
{\an8}HE WAS LIKE, "$395."
I WAS LIKE, "UH."

10:36.052 --> 10:36.594
{\an8}HE WAS LIKE,
"OH, I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT."

10:36.677 --> 10:38.095
{\an8}YEAH, IT WAS $2 OFF.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.556
{\an8}THANKS.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.058
{\an8}- I GOT TO GET OUT
OF THIS SUN.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.268
{\an8}I CAN'T SEE.
- WANT MY GLASSES?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.645
{\an8}- [laughs]

10:52.151 --> 10:53.819
{\an8}- DAMN.
SOMEBODY SQUISHED MY BREAD.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.404
{\an8}WHO SQUISHED MY BUNS?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.989
{\an8}- TONIGHT, WE'RE GONNA COOK

10:57.073 --> 11:00.910
{\an8}OF CHICKEN AND SOME STEAK
AND POSSIBLY SOME PASTA.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.746

11:08.459 --> 11:10.961
{\an8}- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.130
{\an8}- ANGELINA, REALLY, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.591
{\an8}BUT, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW
I REALLY CAN'T [bleep] WITH HER

11:15.674 --> 11:17.468
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE'S GOT DIRT ON ME.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.303
{\an8}- I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.888
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE
[bleep] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.223
{\an8}- EXACTLY.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.690
{\an8}LIKE, ME BEING YOUR FRIEND,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.442
{\an8}LIKE, I FEEL
LIKE YOU SHOULD JUST BE SINGLE.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.568
{\an8}- YEAH, I KNOW.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.070
{\an8}- LIKE, IT'S TOO MUCH DRAMA
WITH THAT.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.947
{\an8}LIKE,
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT

11:38.030 --> 11:39.490
{\an8}BECAUSE, LIKE, I DON'T LIKE HER
AS A PERSON, LIKE,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.367
{\an8}JUST LIKE IN GENERAL.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.369
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- ESPECIALLY NOW, THOUGH,

11:43.452 --> 11:45.121
{\an8}IN SOUTH BEACH.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.831
{\an8}SEE, I STILL LOVE HER.
I LIKE HER.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
{\an8}I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.377
{\an8}SOMETIMES
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.425
{\an8}- OH, PERFECT.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.844
{\an8}WATCH WHEN YOU OPEN UP
THAT FRIDGE, DUDE,

11:59.927 --> 12:00.719
{\an8}THAT MEAT DON'T FALL
OVER SOMEBODY.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
{\an8}THAT'D BE [bleep] FUNNY
AS HELL.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.393
{\an8}- I CAN'T SEE.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.978
{\an8}I'M WALKING BLIND HERE.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.896
{\an8}D'YOU GET ANY PICKLES?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.318
{\an8}OOH!

12:16.402 --> 12:17.319
{\an8}PICK IT UP.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.030
{\an8}- OH, NO.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.491
{\an8}- THERE GOES THE DINNER
ON THE FLOOR.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.994
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO IT!

12:25.077 --> 12:29.415
{\an8}[laughs]

12:29.498 --> 12:32.126
{\an8}OH, NO!

12:32.209 --> 12:35.004
{\an8}THEY GOT ON MY SLIPPERS.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.047
{\an8}- SNOOKI JUST
IS A WALKING DISASTER.

12:37.131 --> 12:37.840
{\an8}EVERYWHERE SHE GOES,
SHE FALLS.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.967
{\an8}EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES DROPS.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.510
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.720
{\an8}SHE JUST ATTRACTS DRAMA.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.804
{\an8}- I DON'T FEEL
LIKE CLEANING THIS.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.139
{\an8}IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.015
{\an8}MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS

12:46.098 --> 12:47.808
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO CLEAN THIS UP.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.894
{\an8}MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS
I JUST [bleep] UP DINNER.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.396
{\an8}MY THIRD THOUGHT WAS
WHAT THE [bleep] AM I GONNA EAT?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.315
{\an8}- MIKE!
- WHAT?

12:54.398 --> 12:57.359
{\an8}- SNOOKI OPENED THE FRIDGE, AND
THE CHICKEN FELL ON THE FLOOR.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.360
{\an8}- WOW.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
{\an8}- WHAT DO WE DO,
WASH IT OR SOMETHING?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.530
{\an8}- THEY ACTUALLY LEFT IT
ON THE FLOOR

13:01.614 --> 13:05.117
{\an8}AND THEN CALLED ME
AND SAID, "WHAT SHOULD WE DO

13:05.201 --> 13:06.368
{\an8}WITH THE CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR?"

13:06.452 --> 13:08.454
{\an8}PICK THE [bleep] UP,
DOG.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.371
{\an8}WHO DID THAT?
SNOOKI?

13:09.455 --> 13:11.874
{\an8}- YEAH.
- OF COURSE SHE DID THAT.

13:11.957 --> 13:12.541
{\an8}OH, MY GOD.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.752
{\an8}- IT'S NOT MY FAULT

13:14.835 --> 13:16.545
{\an8}SOME [bleep] PUT IT ON TOP

13:16.629 --> 13:18.714
{\an8}OF THE FRIDGE WHERE,
IF YOU OPEN THE FRIDGE,

13:18.797 --> 13:20.174
{\an8}IT'S GONNA FALL.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.592
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO,
STOP WITH THE PAPER TOWELS.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.052
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO USE?

13:23.135 --> 13:25.346
{\an8}- A RAG OR SOMETHING.
DON'T KEEP USING PAPER TOWELS.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.057
{\an8}SNOOKI CANNOT CLEAN.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.601
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO [bleep]
WIPE [bleep] OFF OF THE FLOOR.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.894
{\an8}I'M TEACHING YOU
HOW TO BE A WOMAN.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.562
{\an8}IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY WIFE ONE DAY...

13:33.646 --> 13:34.897
{\an8}- YEAH.
- YOU GOT TO LEARN

13:34.980 --> 13:37.024
{\an8}HOW TO AT LEAST CLEAN UP.
- IT'S CALLED A MAID.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.692
{\an8}- DON'T LIFT IT UP
OFF THE GROUND.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.860
{\an8}- VINNY, DO YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

13:39.944 --> 13:40.736
{\an8}- I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.655
{\an8}- I'M GONNA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

13:42.738 --> 13:43.906
{\an8}WHO IS CAROLINE
IN YOUR PHONEBOOK?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.574
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GOING
THROUGH MY PHONEBOOK?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.618
{\an8}- I JUST FEEL LIKE
MAYBE RONNIE

13:47.701 --> 13:49.245
{\an8}IS, LIKE, MIND GAMING ME
A LITTLE BIT.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.789
{\an8}SO [bleep] YOU, OKAY,
AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.749
{\an8}- I SEE YOU!
- NO!

13:53.832 --> 13:55.751
{\an8}- I CAN SEE EVERYTHING
RIGHT NOW.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.211
{\an8}- WHAT?
LET ME SEE.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.921
{\an8}- OH, BOOBIES!

14:07.763 --> 14:08.973
{\an8}- SNOOK, WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS,
I THINK.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.770
{\an8}- SO WE'RE ALL HANGING OUT.
NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.063
{\an8}- TAN LINE.
- DAMN, THAT'S MIAMI, BABY.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.692
{\an8}- NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
LIKE, I'M SITTING AT THE PHONE,

14:19.775 --> 14:22.069
{\an8}I WAS LOOKING
AT THE PHONEBOOKS,

14:22.152 --> 14:23.279
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE,
"OH, LET ME CHECK OUT RON'S."

14:23.362 --> 14:26.740
{\an8}I OPEN UP HIS BOOK,
AND I SEE THE NAME CAROLINE,

14:26.824 --> 14:29.660
{\an8}WHO IS RONNIE'S EX-GIRLFRIEND.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
{\an8}WEIRD.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.872
{\an8}I'M GONNA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.790
{\an8}WHO IS CAROLINE
IN YOUR PHONEBOOK?

14:34.873 --> 14:37.293
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHO IS CAROLINE?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.544
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GOING
THROUGH MY PHONEBOOK?

14:38.627 --> 14:39.712
{\an8}- I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
ONE THING.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.796
{\an8}- I DON'T UNDERSTAND--
- LISTEN TO ME.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.006
{\an8}I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE RONNIE

14:42.089 --> 14:43.507
{\an8}IS, LIKE, MIND GAMING ME
A LITTLE BIT.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.383
{\an8}AND IT'S NOT COOL.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.302
{\an8}I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.470
{\an8}'CAUSE I WOULD NEVER,
EVER WRITE

14:48.554 --> 14:50.222
{\an8}A [bleep] EX-GIRLFRIEND'S NUMBER

14:50.306 --> 14:51.640
{\an8}IN A PHONEBOOK.
- COULD YOU SIT DOWN

14:51.724 --> 14:53.267
{\an8}AND TALK
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

14:53.350 --> 14:54.560
{\an8}- I'M OVER IT.
GET THAT.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.936
{\an8}WHY WOULD YOU WRITE THAT?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.689
{\an8}ANSWER MY QUESTION.
WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

14:58.772 --> 14:59.732
{\an8}DO YOU TALK TO HER?
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.817
{\an8}- I'VE TALKED TO HER.
- WHEN?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.277
{\an8}- LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.988
{\an8}- SO [bleep] YOU, OKAY,
AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.156
{\an8}- OKAY.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.782
{\an8}I DON'T THINK ANY BOYFRIEND
OR GIRLFRIEND

15:08.866 --> 15:11.327
{\an8}HAS A RIGHT TO GO THROUGH
EACH OTHER'S STUFF, YOU KNOW.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.412
{\an8}WE WEREN'T EVEN TOGETHER.
THAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.414
{\an8}PSYCHO GOING
THROUGH MY [bleep] PHONEBOOK.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.540
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU,
OUT OF YOUR [bleep] MIND?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.167
{\an8}- WHO?
- SAMMI.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.377
{\an8}- YOU GUYS DON'T STOP.
- CRAZY, BRO?

15:20.461 --> 15:23.047
{\an8}- SO HE WROTE
HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND'S NUMBER

15:23.130 --> 15:24.173
{\an8}IN THAT BOOK?
- AND SHE WENT THROUGH IT.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.424
{\an8}- WHAT AN AM--
WHAT AN IDIOT.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.592
{\an8}- SO EVEN IF HE DID THAT...
- IDIOT!

15:26.675 --> 15:28.636
{\an8}- NO. HE'S FINE.
- PUT JOE OR SOMETHING.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.095
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT SHE SHOULDN'T BE
GOING THROUGH HIS PHONEBOOK.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.347
{\an8}- THAT'S TRUE.
- TO BEGIN WITH.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.931
{\an8}- REGARDLESS.
YOU GOT TO PREPARE FOR THAT.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.099
{\an8}YOU GOT TO PREPARE FOR THAT.
- I WOULD HAVE.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.310
{\an8}- I WOULD TOO.
- I GOT YOU.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.188
{\an8}- SAM, CAN YOU TALK TO ME

15:39.271 --> 15:40.522
{\an8}SO WE CAN DO THIS
THE RIGHT WAY?

15:40.606 --> 15:41.649
{\an8}- I'M OVER IT.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.608
{\an8}OVER IT.

15:42.691 --> 15:47.655
{\an8}SO BACK THE [bleep] AWAY
FROM ME.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.448
{\an8}I OBVIOUSLY LOVE HIM A LOT,

15:49.531 --> 15:51.533
{\an8}AND I OBVIOUSLY
CARE ABOUT HIM A LOT.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.618
{\an8}AND I'M IN THIS POSITION

15:52.701 --> 15:57.623
{\an8}WHERE MY MIND IS [bleep] UP
AND TWISTED.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.501

YOU GOT TO COOK IT ANYWAY.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.137
{\an8}SO ALL GERMS
ARE GONNA GET KILLED.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.472
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.224
{\an8}I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT EATING
ANYTHING OFF THE FLOOR.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.809
{\an8}- I'M NOT EATING ANYTHING
OFF THE FLOOR.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.143
{\an8}- I THINK THAT'S ONLY
IF YOU BOIL IT.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.520
{\an8}- BRO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

16:19.603 --> 16:20.396
{\an8}- THIS FELL ON THE FLOOR.
WOULD YOU EAT IT?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.606
{\an8}- PROBABLY NOT.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.858
{\an8}- SO WHAT ARE WE HAVING
FOR SUPPER, GRANOLA BARS?

16:27.111 --> 16:28.737
{\an8}- SHE'S GONNA RUIN IT.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.198
{\an8}- SHE'S GONNA--
- I HOPE SHE DOESN'T.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.158
{\an8}- LIKE, "I'M OVER YOU.
[bleep] YOU.

16:33.242 --> 16:33.701
{\an8}STAY THE [bleep] AWAY

16:33.784 --> 16:36.704
{\an8}LIKE, COME ON.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.913

{\an8}YOU SAW--
AND WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.127
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
