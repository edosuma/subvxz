Okay.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.619
In the Seven,
it's a little dark.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.705
Let's create a rainbow arc.

19:24.788 --> 19:28.250
[thunder crashing]

19:28.333 --> 19:30.252
You know, for someone who can
create fire and tornados

19:30.335 --> 19:31.503
with his hands,
you sure scare easily.

19:31.587 --> 19:35.215
- Well, if that's your
definition of a rainbow,

19:35.299 --> 19:37.467
I don't even wanna know what
your rainstorm looks like.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.600
Hey, it worked.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.976
- I did it!

19:46.059 --> 19:47.185
- This calls for a celebration.

[wind rushing]

19:55.027 --> 19:56.778
- [gasps]

19:56.862 --> 19:58.030
Snow!

20:00.032 --> 20:02.701
[laughing]

20:09.416 --> 20:09.917
- Snow?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.502
He made snow?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.963
How are we supposed
to compete with that?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.299
- The only thing that happens
when I blow out really hard

20:17.382 --> 20:21.094
is that I get really
lightheaded and...

20:21.178 --> 20:22.930
faint.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.809
- We gotta break this
buddy-buddy team up.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.565
- This is Miss Information
coming to you live

20:33.649 --> 20:34.733
from the janitor's clos--

20:35.525 --> 20:39.404
Studio JC1 at Iridium High.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.822
The video I'm about to play

20:40.906 --> 20:43.241
has not been edited
or tampered with.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.828
It is absolute proof that
witches exist and--

20:46.912 --> 20:49.164
Coach Desdemona?

20:49.247 --> 20:50.707
- Hello, Gigi.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.627
I hear you're the go-to student
for any and all information

20:53.710 --> 20:54.670
at Iridium High.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.922
- Yes.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.840
And I was just doing
a very important newscast,

20:58.924 --> 21:00.467
so if you'll excuse me...

21:00.550 --> 21:02.844
- Mmm, no can do.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.680
I can't let you reveal
the magic realm.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.847
- The what?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.392
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, silly Gigi.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.310
How can you report on something
when you don't even

21:10.394 --> 21:11.561
know what it's called?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.689
- [gasps]
You're one of them.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.816
Stay back!

21:18.110 --> 21:20.404
- Don't worry.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.990
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.367
I'm gonna recruit you.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.785
- To do what?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.079
- To be my most
devout follower.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.039
Oh, I always wanted a minion.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.083
- I'll never follow you.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.918
- Your magic exposé
will never be.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.336
And you will be
loyal to only me.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.383
[laughing]

21:42.759 --> 21:45.554
No use running.
