TEACHER'S DIET IS WORKING

01:09.596 --> 01:11.186
Aye, caramba!

01:22.669 --> 01:24.422
Out of gas?!
But how?

01:24.457 --> 01:27.371
I put a dollar in this morning
and we've only driven 90 cents.

01:27.406 --> 01:31.634
You had to drive with the windows
down, didn't ya, Rockefeller?

01:31.669 --> 01:35.084
Now get some gas while I read
my bingo strategy guide.

01:35.297 --> 01:37.253
Let's see, B-12....

01:48.974 --> 01:49.974
I did it!

01:51.366 --> 01:52.393
Bonehead.

02:02.808 --> 02:05.246
This counts as a
parent-teacher conference!

02:08.935 --> 02:12.580
Whoa! Am I seeing this right?

02:12.615 --> 02:15.041
PRINCIPAL CROSSING FREEWAY
- EXPECT DELAYS

02:15.128 --> 02:17.887
I am. Time to spread the word.

02:19.451 --> 02:21.129
- Hey, Milhouse.
- Talk to me.

02:21.368 --> 02:23.591
Skinner's doing what?

02:25.544 --> 02:27.637
- I'm on my way.
- I'm on my way.

02:44.819 --> 02:48.491
I'll clean you up good, giant beer can.

02:54.935 --> 02:57.198
- Where's Simpson?
- I couldn't get a hold of him.

02:57.233 --> 03:02.672
No cell phone. But if I know Bart, But if I
know Bart, he's busy doing something awesome.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.744
I don't know why I agreed to this.

03:05.779 --> 03:09.470
Because you love the
taste of my imaginary tea.

03:09.601 --> 03:11.825
Oh, you're right.

03:13.241 --> 03:17.218
Hey, Spaz! While you were here spazzing
yourself, you totally missed out.

03:17.253 --> 03:20.315
Missed out? I didn't miss
out. What'd I miss out on?

03:26.966 --> 03:28.754
I wish I had a cell phone.

03:28.789 --> 03:30.660
Here's an imaginary cell phone.

03:30.695 --> 03:32.769
What, do you think I'm crazy?

03:36.452 --> 03:38.630
Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone.

03:38.665 --> 03:41.656
Your son is lamer than Milhouse.
What does that say about you?

03:41.691 --> 03:44.797
Sweetie, we can't afford
to get you a cell phone.

03:44.930 --> 03:48.676
As it is, I'm buying
frozen peas on installments.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.970
ACCOUNT OVERDUE - FINAL NOTICE

03:53.985 --> 03:55.475
WE'RE NOT KIDDING!

03:57.372 --> 03:59.899
Oh, I'm never gonna get a cell phone.

03:59.934 --> 04:01.787
And I'm never gonna go to Machu Picchu.

04:01.822 --> 04:04.478
In this family, you get
used to disappointments.

04:04.513 --> 04:06.903
ME SAD 2

04:07.732 --> 04:10.031
How am I ever gonna get a cell phone?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.503
- Is this your ball?
- Why, yes, it is.

04:26.690 --> 04:30.200
- Here you go.
- Don't tell me where I go.

04:30.235 --> 04:31.803
A dollar?
What for?

04:31.981 --> 04:35.819
It's the least I can do. These
balls cost five dollars new.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.519
So I can get a dollar
for every ball I find?

04:38.554 --> 04:42.259
Then if a cell phone costs
$100, how many balls do I need?

04:42.294 --> 04:44.576
This is why my kids go to private school.

05:11.683 --> 05:14.622
I'll fix you, you varmint!

05:15.016 --> 05:17.659
Wow, I'm just 20 balls away from a cell phone.

05:17.694 --> 05:21.564
So it's you! You're the one who's
been poaching on me territory.

05:21.599 --> 05:22.708
Groundskeeper Willie?

05:22.743 --> 05:25.872
Weekends and summers,
I'm Greenskeeper Willie.

05:25.907 --> 05:28.457
Your ball-scavenging days are over.

05:28.492 --> 05:31.086
And those orphan golf
balls belong to me.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.770
Ah! Dimpled gold. I'm rich.

05:33.805 --> 05:39.203
Now I won't have to pleasure a
country-club wife to get me steak dinner.

05:42.729 --> 05:45.084
I'm never gonna get a cell phone.

THE KRUSTY KLASSIC CELEBRITY PRO-AM
NOT A PENNY FOR CHARITY

05:48.462 --> 05:51.577
Oh, great! We've got
to wait for Denis Leary.

05:51.612 --> 05:55.774
Hey, Leary, if you want to have
a tea party, go back to Boston.

05:57.994 --> 05:58.994
Boston.

06:00.390 --> 06:02.822
Come on, Ice Age. Take the shot.

06:02.857 --> 06:05.129
"Ice Age"was the name of the film. I played Diego,

06:05.164 --> 06:07.619
the vicious saber-toothed tiger,
who, guess what, has a heart.

06:07.654 --> 06:11.027
Now shut up or I'll have you
all kicked out of show business.

06:14.655 --> 06:15.655
Damn it!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.507
A cell phone!

06:21.823 --> 06:23.503
It's mine!

06:24.633 --> 06:28.169
Aw, cool. You can even
watch commercials on it.

06:31.489 --> 06:33.424
Hey, Milhouse, guess
where I'm calling from?

06:33.459 --> 06:37.451
Well, I know you don't have a cell
phone, so you must be in your kitchen.

06:37.486 --> 06:39.110
Or one of your bedrooms.

06:39.145 --> 06:41.653
Unless you have a wall
jack in your basement.

06:41.688 --> 06:44.352
- That would be huge!
- Look outside your window.

06:44.387 --> 06:47.313
I'm not supposed to look out
the window when I'm alone.

06:47.348 --> 06:48.348
Just do it!

06:50.003 --> 06:52.025
Cell phone!

06:52.623 --> 06:54.869
Let's assign each other ringtones.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.823
That felt good.

07:00.193 --> 07:03.683
Hello. You want Denis Leary?
Wrong number, dumb-ass.

07:03.718 --> 07:06.349
Come on, Denis. It's me,
producer Brian Grazer.

07:06.384 --> 07:11.026
I just paid $5 million for the screen
rights to the book Everybody Poops.

07:11.061 --> 07:12.138
I'm a big fan.

07:12.173 --> 07:16.243
Only one face came to mind for
the constipated gorilla: yours.

07:16.278 --> 07:19.628
Sure-- on one condition.
I want to do my own poops.

07:19.663 --> 07:22.336
I wouldn't have it any other way.

07:22.371 --> 07:23.981
Of course I'll do it for minimum.

07:24.016 --> 07:26.880
Great. I'll see you
next Monday in Tunisia.

07:26.915 --> 07:29.005
This phone belongs to Denis Leary!

07:29.040 --> 07:30.421
Denis Leary?

07:30.456 --> 07:34.680
Boston comedian-turned-movie-star-
turned-basic-cable-notable?

07:34.715 --> 07:37.711
That's right. Let's call his
business manager and tell him to spend

07:37.746 --> 07:40.491
all his money on Yankees
hats and Derek Jeter jerseys.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.467
I don't know, Bart. What
if Denis Leary gets mad?

07:44.502 --> 07:48.040
Naw, he's cool. He's gonna
think this is hilarious.

07:48.075 --> 07:50.084
ONE WEEK LATER...
IN TUNESIA

07:53.066 --> 07:55.737
No longer must we live in shame!

07:55.772 --> 07:59.427
Let the decree go forth: everybody poops!

07:59.462 --> 08:00.855
And... cut!

08:00.890 --> 08:04.223
Great, great, man. You really nailed it!

08:04.258 --> 08:06.499
I don't even rember
agreeing to be in this movie.

08:06.534 --> 08:08.364
Well, you did. Bring in the poop.

08:13.169 --> 08:15.977
Milhouse, I hold in this
hand Denis Leary's cell phone,

08:16.012 --> 08:19.215
and in this hand, the phone
numbers of bars around the world.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.880
Let's start with Hawaii.

08:23.716 --> 08:25.369
- Aloha.
- Aloha to you.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.881
I'm looking for Maya. Last name Normousbutt.

08:27.916 --> 08:31.459
Hang on. I'll check. Has anyone
here seen Maya Normousbutt?

08:41.384 --> 08:45.473
I got a "Drew P. Wiener" here.
Anyone expecting a Drew P. Wiener?

08:45.508 --> 08:48.017
I hold in my hand a Drew P. Wiener.

08:48.052 --> 08:49.781
Better put it down then, mate.

08:57.177 --> 08:58.402
INGA-BAR BEERMAN'S

08:58.998 --> 09:00.134
Ja?

09:00.169 --> 09:01.893
I shall inquire.

09:01.928 --> 09:05.090
Is there a Mr. Myfriendsaregay?

09:05.125 --> 09:07.012
First name Olaf?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.021
Attention, everyone.

09:09.056 --> 09:11.337
Olaf Myfriendsaregay.

09:13.869 --> 09:17.505
Wait a minute. If I ever get a hold of you...

09:17.747 --> 09:22.635
I will thank you for showing me
the futility of human endeavor.

09:23.874 --> 09:27.682
Oh, the sun never sets
on the Bartish Empire.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.599
- Yo. Who's this?
- Denis Leary, you little puke!

09:30.634 --> 09:32.502
I'm gonna rip out your
heart with two fingers!

09:32.503 --> 09:34.131
They taught me how to do it for my show!

09:34.166 --> 09:37.566
Which one, the one that got canceled
or the one that's gonna get canceled?

09:37.601 --> 09:39.360
You are so dead!

09:40.384 --> 09:43.614
That laughter sounds like
the result of misbehavior.

09:43.729 --> 09:45.977
Bart, how did you get a cell phone?

09:46.012 --> 09:49.133
Same way you got me: by
accident, on a golf course.

09:49.168 --> 09:51.691
- Whose phone is this?
- You'll never get it out of me.

09:51.726 --> 09:55.626
- Okay. Milhouse?
- It's Denis Leary's!

09:55.752 --> 09:59.463
I'm sorry, Bart. I'm desperate
for any signs of adult approval.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.590
You did the right thing.

10:04.767 --> 10:08.097
Uh... Bart Simpson's stolen
cell phone. Can I help you?

10:08.132 --> 10:11.350
Damn straight you can! I'm Denis
Leary, and your kid is out of control!

10:11.385 --> 10:15.686
I'm sorry, Mr. Leary. Sometimes
it's hard to be a parent.

10:15.721 --> 10:17.617
No it's not. It's easy!
I'll tell you what's hard:

10:17.652 --> 10:19.872
having to watch my stunt double
run into a burning building,

10:19.907 --> 10:22.942
worrying that people might
realize it's not me; it's him.

10:22.943 --> 10:23.779
Try doing that!

10:23.814 --> 10:25.812
I don't think I could.

10:26.470 --> 10:30.229
Mr. Leary, I'm so sorry. I'll send
you your phone back right away.

10:30.264 --> 10:32.440
Keep the phone. In fact, can I give you some advice?

10:32.475 --> 10:34.692
Of course. You're Denis Leary!

10:34.727 --> 10:38.070
Give your kid back the phone... but
first, activate its built-in GPS system.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.102
That way you can log on
to your carrier's Web site

10:40.137 --> 10:41.872
and track your son's movements,

10:41.907 --> 10:44.403
the way I track every actor who
gets a movie that I was up for.

10:45.154 --> 10:47.621
Shouldn't you just be
happy for their success?

10:47.656 --> 10:50.306
I should be a lot of things, lady.

10:51.093 --> 10:52.308
My Tarts!

11:02.035 --> 11:03.903
SATELLITE TRACKING ON

11:04.445 --> 11:05.883
Okay, here goes.

11:05.918 --> 11:08.824
Bart, I have something for you!

11:12.909 --> 11:14.862
Wait a minute. I thought you
said I couldn't have this.

11:14.897 --> 11:18.459
Well, sweetie... I know I said
you couldn't have a cell phone,

11:18.494 --> 11:22.244
but, in these days of stranger
dangers and sinister ministers,

11:22.279 --> 11:24.382
I think it's important
that we're in touch.

11:25.497 --> 11:27.718
Lady, you are the best mom ever!

11:34.261 --> 11:37.436
- Did he take the bait?
- Like a big-mouthed bass.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.400
Okay, Bart went to the comic book store.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.428
Time to head home.

11:44.463 --> 11:45.929
Bullies!

11:47.180 --> 11:49.584
Hey, he went into a construction site.

11:49.619 --> 11:51.534
That's a hard hat zone!

11:52.972 --> 11:54.870
You sure this is safe?

11:54.905 --> 11:56.503
Sure, I got my seat belt on.

11:56.538 --> 11:58.624
Bartholomew J. Simpson!

12:00.521 --> 12:03.170
What are you doing at
this construction site?!

12:04.055 --> 12:05.673
Uh, trying to do something constructive?

12:06.779 --> 12:09.093
I'll just take Milhouse home.

12:13.194 --> 12:15.790
# You better watch your step. #

12:19.396 --> 12:27.507
# My, I send you all my regards. #
# You're so tough, you're so hard. #

12:27.508 --> 12:32.906
# Listen to the hammers #
# falling in the breakers' yard. #

12:34.009 --> 12:40.433
# You better watch your step. #
# You better watch your step. #

12:42.023 --> 12:44.671
# Ooh, watch your step... #

12:49.841 --> 12:53.831
Hey, Bart just keeps spinning
around and around and around.

12:53.866 --> 12:55.848
What's his angle?

13:01.060 --> 13:03.070
What are you two doing
in the laundry room?

13:03.963 --> 13:07.985
- Uh... we're doing laundry.
- Dad, do laundry.

13:08.823 --> 13:10.160
No problem.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.710
Tracking software?

13:25.940 --> 13:28.342
You're spying on Bart!

13:28.377 --> 13:32.244
Honey, keeping track of someone
because you love them is not wrong.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.762
It shows you care.

13:34.885 --> 13:40.017
That's right, my
beautiful, beautiful Midge.

13:40.239 --> 13:41.791
Soon you'll be mine.

13:41.826 --> 13:43.894
Keep talking, creep-o.

13:43.929 --> 13:47.316
Every word buys you
another year in the slammer.

13:53.218 --> 13:55.014
Bart, there's something
I need to tell you.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.343
Mom and Dad...

13:58.430 --> 14:01.278
I'm listening to financing
terms for double-glazed windows.

14:01.313 --> 14:03.556
Awesome. Another call. You got Bart.

14:03.591 --> 14:06.366
It's me, you idiot. Mom
and Dad are spying on you.

14:06.401 --> 14:08.963
There's a tracking
chip in your cell phone.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.159
They're spying on me? That's horrible!

14:12.194 --> 14:15.611
I know! It's a complete violation
of your rights. Not to mention...

14:15.646 --> 14:17.555
Hold that thought. I'm getting a text.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.307
Viagra at five dollars a pill?

14:20.516 --> 14:23.310
Whatever it is, it's
goin' in Skinner's coffee.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.814
What is in this coffee?!

14:39.557 --> 14:41.412
Track this, Mom and Dad.

14:44.992 --> 14:48.254
Look at Bart go! He
must be running away!

14:48.289 --> 14:52.199
Eh, he won't get far. Not on the
crappy breakfast I made for him.

14:52.234 --> 14:55.759
Oh, my God, he's out of
frame! Zoom out! Zoom out!

14:57.091 --> 14:58.887
What...?

14:59.158 --> 15:02.349
Hmm. He's circling the
Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.237
Our little boy has lost his mind.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.355
Let's get him.

15:13.799 --> 15:16.572
Looks like I've got the
house to myself for a while.

15:17.075 --> 15:18.399
I can do anything I want!

15:18.434 --> 15:22.292
First, I'm gonna take a bath.
Then I'm gonna eat some vegetables

15:22.327 --> 15:28.792
and then I'm gonna get to bed
nice and early, with no TV.

15:33.012 --> 15:35.816
So your family's been
gone for three days?

15:35.851 --> 15:38.312
Yeah. And I think they
may be gone a while longer.

15:38.347 --> 15:40.812
Ooh, it looks like the
grilled Twizzlers are ready.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.670
Oh, yeah. This baby is done.

15:46.288 --> 15:47.288
CHOCOLATE SYRUP

15:51.823 --> 15:55.110
Awesome. But I better get
goin'. It's gettin' dark.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.687
My mom's gonna wake up soon.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.869
She gets upset if someone's not
there to tell her where she is.

16:00.898 --> 16:02.409
Typical mom.

16:02.558 --> 16:06.121
You sure you don't wanna stay and have
a sleepover? I made sleepover shirts.

16:06.156 --> 16:07.414
BART SIMPSONS
SLEEPTACULAR

16:07.623 --> 16:10.435
Listen Bart, if I don't get
home soon, there won't be time

16:10.470 --> 16:13.646
for my mom to give me a hug,
my dad to read me a story,

16:13.681 --> 16:18.509
and both of them to sing me a
song until I gently fall asleep.

16:18.669 --> 16:21.100
Anyway, you have fun by yourself.

16:21.679 --> 16:25.182
There's no moon tonight.
Real boogeyman weather.

16:34.845 --> 16:37.533
Bart's been moving
nonstop all afternoon.

16:37.568 --> 16:41.454
Maybe there's too much sugar
in his Sugar-Frosted Candy O's.

16:41.489 --> 16:43.592
Something about this
just doesn't seem right.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.619
Pull over. Bart's in this field.

16:48.561 --> 16:51.779
Bart! Where are you, boy?!

16:51.814 --> 16:55.892
Don't worry. I won't strangle you.

17:04.575 --> 17:08.308
I think we're following you.
What's your species, little guy?

17:10.632 --> 17:12.406
Oh, you're a scarlet tanager.

17:12.442 --> 17:15.241
You've been flying south
because you're migrating to...

17:15.276 --> 17:17.279
Machu Picchu, Peru!

17:17.314 --> 17:19.902
Well, I could tell Mom and
Dad the chip is in the bird

17:19.936 --> 17:22.805
and hope they take me to
Machu Picchu another time,

17:22.839 --> 17:23.839
or...
Shoo. Shoo.

17:25.096 --> 17:27.618
Mom! Dad! Bart's on the move!

17:31.404 --> 17:34.334
Oh, man. When you're
alone, night is scary.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.588
Day is awesome!

17:38.148 --> 17:39.256
Night is scary.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.722
Day is awesome!

17:44.189 --> 17:46.221
Night is scary...

17:49.656 --> 17:52.019
Are we ever going to find him?

17:52.231 --> 17:55.564
Absolutely. That unpleasantness
in Ecuador is behind us.

17:55.599 --> 17:58.512
My coca leaf addiction is under control,

17:58.547 --> 18:03.693
and Bart is finally trapped in
that paradise above the clouds.

18:07.462 --> 18:10.713
Bart! Where are you, Bart?

18:10.748 --> 18:11.872
Is that him?

18:13.303 --> 18:15.375
No, it's just a bush.

18:16.085 --> 18:19.671
Clearly the work of
Wirakocha, the trickster god.

18:20.519 --> 18:23.731
You guys look exhausted. Maybe
you ought to rest for a while.

18:23.766 --> 18:26.753
No! All I care about is finding my boy,

18:26.788 --> 18:29.723
and then I'm never letting
him out of my sight again.

18:39.799 --> 18:41.985
Greetings, sky-haired sun mother.

18:42.999 --> 18:46.657
Um... I don't need any new friends.
I'm just looking for my little boy.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.867
I need to protect him from himself.

18:48.902 --> 18:53.282
Like the mothers of ancient Machu
Picchu protected their children?

19:02.239 --> 19:04.236
Our mothers were the most overprotective

19:04.271 --> 19:06.451
in the greater Machu
Picchu metropolitan area.

19:06.486 --> 19:09.971
They forced their children to
live in this walled mountain city.

19:10.006 --> 19:12.252
Those walls do look safe.

19:12.287 --> 19:15.381
Walls that keep out
danger keep out knowledge.

19:15.416 --> 19:17.991
Our young people never learned
to survive on their own,

19:18.026 --> 19:21.733
so when they grew up, they were
no match for the conquistadors.

19:30.305 --> 19:33.345
Oh, my God. You've taught
me a valuable lesson.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.983
I didn't mean to. I'm just chatty.

19:35.018 --> 19:38.117
I sold my business a few years
ago and I miss talking to people.

19:42.601 --> 19:44.730
So I can't always be there for Bart.

19:44.765 --> 19:46.939
He's got to learn to take care of himself.

19:46.974 --> 19:49.421
The computer says Bart's
standing on the computer,

19:49.456 --> 19:52.743
but all I see is a stupid bird
with a tracking chip on its leg.

19:52.778 --> 19:54.016
It doesn't add up.

19:57.509 --> 19:59.855
I think it's time for us to go home.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.536
- Hey.
- Thank God you're okay!

20:07.571 --> 20:09.234
Were you guys gone?

20:09.269 --> 20:12.784
- We were gone for two weeks.
- I didn't even notice.

20:14.566 --> 20:17.248
I just made a 3,700-mile car trip.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.792
I need to wash up.

20:21.850 --> 20:23.295
Never leave again.

20:29.152 --> 20:31.845
- Where's Maggie?
- Oh, uh, she's, uh...

20:32.305 --> 20:38.946
