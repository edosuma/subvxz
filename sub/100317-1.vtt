01:03.631 --> 01:04.563
Thanks.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.100
Thank you.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.812
Oh, look.
He's proposing to her.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.346
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:21.348 --> 01:22.281
Yes.

01:32.693 --> 01:33.659
What happened?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.094
He proposed.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.629
In public?

01:38.732 --> 01:39.765
That's risky.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.733
You proposed
to me in public.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.771
Well, a public place,
we were the only ones there.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.108
I couldn't figure out why you were making me climb up that hill.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.342
You kept telling me to hurry.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.311
I wanted to get
there before sunset.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.745
I thought I had
to do something special

01:53.747 --> 01:56.582
to beat that other guy,
what's his name?

01:56.584 --> 01:58.350
You lived with him,
had all the money.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.502
Oh, Adam.

02:00.503 --> 02:02.653
I thought he must have done something
really spectacular when he proposed.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.157
You didn't have to worry.
He never proposed.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.126
And he didn't
have that much money.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.262
What do you mean
he never proposed?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.431
Oh, you know,
things just ran their course.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.200
I'm sure you
told me he proposed.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.335
No, I couldn't have.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.871
I mean he wanted
to marry me, yeah.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.306
If he wanted to marry you,
surely he would have proposed.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.176
No, you know, what it's like.
Women have to hint a bit.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.411
I never did any of that,
so he never asked.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.913
Even though he
wanted to marry me.

02:27.915 --> 02:31.183
Well, you couldn't have
been certain if he never asked.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.152
Oh, I knew.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.854
God, we were so young.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.323
Didn't know what love was.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.727
I'm sure you
told me he proposed.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.661
No.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.333
Ooh, chocolate cake sounds
tempting, but I shouldn't.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.837
So who did propose to you?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.574
Nobody, just you.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.543
On the hill, in the dark.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.911
I got a ring and a blister.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.512
Do you wanna split the cake?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.613
Wait.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.916
So no one else
ever proposed to you?

03:03.918 --> 03:06.385
God, I'm sure you somebody
else had proposed to you.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.654
Well, it's
a good thing they didn't,

03:08.656 --> 03:12.191
because if someone had,
I might have said "yes"

03:12.193 --> 03:14.293
and then I wouldn't have been
available to marry you.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.667
Oh, come on, how
many proposals did you get?

03:21.669 --> 03:24.203
Well, men
don't get proposals.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.739
I'm just illustrating the absurdity of judging someone on the basis of--

03:27.741 --> 03:29.241
Two.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.244
Even though men
don't usually get proposals.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.713
The first one was Cynthia.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.281
You said
Cynthia was an idiot.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.784
And then the second one
was Charlotte.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.386
Hang on, I haven't
memorized your dating history.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.138
Which one's Charlotte?

03:43.139 --> 03:44.889
I'm not sure I ever
told you about Charlotte.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.491
Because you just made her up?

03:47.461 --> 03:49.628
I met her when I was
backpacking around Europe.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.630
Oh, she wanted
to emigrate to Canada.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.500
Well, it wasn't 1946.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.369
And I'd also like to point out that you emigrated to Canada to marry me.

03:57.371 --> 04:02.374
And I would like to point out that moving
from London to Toronto is not a step up.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.009
Charlotte lived in Paris.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.011
A very good arrondissement.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.714
Uh, 16th, I believe.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.582
I doubt it was the 16th.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.384
Oh, I believe it was the 16th.

04:12.386 --> 04:16.321
And she said she
couldn't live without me,

04:16.322 --> 04:19.324
we should get married
and spend our lives together.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.494
Oh.

04:22.495 --> 04:25.663
Did she say that in English or French,
because your French is not very good.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.935
Her English was excellent
and she also knew some Italian.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.870
Oh, everybody
knows some Italian.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.806
<i>Ciao. Buona sera. Cappuccino.</i>

04:37.344 --> 04:38.310
Oh, we're done.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.579
We are so done.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.482
Actually,
I would like a coffee.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.418
Just a regular coffee,
black, no sugar.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.024
Look, it's fine.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.742
What's fine?

04:53.743 --> 04:55.459
You know,
that I was the only one who proposed to you.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.662
Fine?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.297
Oh, you know what I mean.

04:58.299 --> 05:04.036
I could have had other proposals,
plenty of proposals, if I'd wanted.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.338
I-- I just
didn't lead men on.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.906
Oh, come on. Plenty?

05:07.908 --> 05:08.974
Plenty.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.876
Men liked me.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.044
Well,
of course men liked you.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.478
You're a very
attractive woman.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.613
But--

05:14.615 --> 05:18.417
Liking someone and proposing to them is something totally different.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.454
So you're saying the problem isn't my looks,
it's-- it's my personality?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.192
Let's change
the subject, I don't care--

05:27.193 --> 05:28.659
No, no,
you are not getting off the hook by changing the subject.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.562
And you do seem
to care an awful lot,

05:30.564 --> 05:34.032
so I'm telling you that I could have got other men to propose to me,

05:34.768 --> 05:36.735
if that's the standard
you judge people by.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.672
A very old-fashioned,
quite offensive standard.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.375
I just generally thought some
other guy had proposed to you--

05:43.377 --> 05:47.579
the rich guy, whoever, but
if it didn't happen, it's okay.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.616
Well, just so you know,
if it makes you feel better,

05:51.618 --> 05:56.355
if it helps you sleep at night,
I could still get a man to propose to me.

05:56.357 --> 06:00.659
I mean not some 22-year-old,
but a man could fall in love with me.

06:00.661 --> 06:01.993
A man my own age.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.030
Yeah, I could make that
happen, if I wanted it to.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.499
You cannot guarantee that you
could get a man to propose.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.934
To sleep with you? Yes.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.870
But it's a big thing
for a man to propose.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.706
Oh yes, I could get
a man to propose to me!

06:14.708 --> 06:19.778
If I went after the next man who walked
through that door and I-- I tried--

06:19.780 --> 06:24.850
I turned on the charm, I fluffed up his ego,
I could get him to fall for me like--

06:26.120 --> 06:27.686
Like that.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.822
That. If I really wanted to.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.633
Oh my God. What are you doing?
You're not--

06:42.136 --> 06:44.002
I just wanna see
who the lucky guy is.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.837
Oh, you're not--

06:46.573 --> 06:48.473
You know, I
didn't mean it literally.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.143
Oh, I'm-- no,
I'm not playing this game.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.846
Yeah, uh,
and you do know the odds are quite overwhelming

06:54.848 --> 06:58.183
that whoever comes
through that door will be female

06:58.185 --> 07:01.653
or married
or the wrong age or gay.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.793
So you are officially backing
down from the bet, right?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.161
So we can say that I won?

07:30.717 --> 07:32.984
Wouldn't want him
to think I was already taken.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.691
As Charlotte would say,
<i>"Arrivederci</i>, baby."

07:40.727 --> 07:41.860
Isabel.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.874
Hi.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.785
A bit of a draught over there.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.719
Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.122
And what can I get you?

08:11.859 --> 08:17.195
Could I have
a glass of red wine? Thanks.

08:29.243 --> 08:32.177
[Laughing out loud]

08:36.750 --> 08:38.517
Just uh, happy.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.851
What a fun evening.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.720
Do you eat here often?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.087
I'm not-- I'm not eating.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.690
You're English.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.060
Small world. Wow!

08:49.062 --> 08:49.995
Wow, we--

08:50.731 --> 08:52.631
We have so much in common.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.636
Don't you find North Americans
kind of arrogant sometimes?

09:00.874 --> 09:05.277
Did you-- you eat already or you're not hungry,
just wondering?

09:05.279 --> 09:06.711
I've already eaten.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.280
I don't-- I really
don't feel like talking.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.581
Oh!

09:10.651 --> 09:11.583
Sure.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.686
I'll uh-- I'll
have another, please.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.788
Oh, me, too.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.291
Just, yeah,
one more at least.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.026
Probably more.

09:27.834 --> 09:32.304
[Mouthing words inaudibly]

09:45.953 --> 09:48.853
You know, I have
a little twitch sometimes.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.355
How is your drink?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.758
I'm thinking maybe I should
have ordered something stronger.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.729
It's a drink.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.097
It's uh, vodka
with some ice cubes.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.676
That wasn't funny.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.713
No.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.947
No, it wasn't.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.122
I don't know if anyone falls for an absolute stranger.
Do they?

10:24.891 --> 10:27.626
I-- someone walks
through the door and poof!

10:28.095 --> 10:31.796
Your life's changed,
a grand passion, and you know.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.701
Instead of a-- a reasonably nice guy leading
you up a hill and where do you end up?

10:37.237 --> 10:41.740
Sitting at a bar on your own on a Saturday night feeling like shit.

10:44.378 --> 10:49.681
The ironic thing is I would be thrilled to fall
for an absolute stranger at the moment.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.917
I really would.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.152
I might not have said that yesterday,
but today it would be wonderful.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.356
Life doesn't really happen
like that though, does it?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.192
It doesn't
work out that way.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.070
Well, there was
this one time, I wa--

11:12.072 --> 11:14.072
I was
on a school trip in Dublin.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.625
I was-- what? 15.

11:16.626 --> 11:19.177
And my friend and I had wandered off.
We weren't supposed to.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.980
But we met this boy,
he was maybe 18,

11:21.982 --> 11:26.685
which seemed so grown-up,
and we started talking.

11:26.687 --> 11:30.689
We talked about everything;
music, politics, books,

11:30.691 --> 11:33.725
we really connected.

11:34.327 --> 11:39.264
And then this boy and I,
we started dancing,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.867
just going down
the street at night, dancing.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.370
My friend just
stood back and watched.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.006
And other people were
looking, but we didn't care.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.442
Oh!

11:50.444 --> 11:54.813
I still remember what
his hand felt like on my back.

11:56.483 --> 12:01.986
Anyway, we said goodbye, it was
getting really late and uh,

12:01.988 --> 12:04.189
we were gonna be
in so much trouble.

12:05.158 --> 12:11.229
And as he walked away from me,
he looked back and said, "See ya."

12:16.737 --> 12:18.269
We both knew we never would.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.038
Never again.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.042
And if we met now, we wouldn't
even recognize each other.

12:24.044 --> 12:28.980
We wouldn't know that we'd spent that
magical night dancing down the street.

12:30.117 --> 12:35.820
But that's what I want,
to feel like that again.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.859
That's what I want a man who walks through that door to do to me.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.095
Ooh, thank you.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.797
I'm not-- I'm
not paying for that.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.365
No, I'm-- I'm not
paying for her drinks.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.800
- Just--
- No, no, of course not.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.135
You know, I
wasn't born yesterday.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.137
- And neither were you, quite frankly.
- What?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.655
Well, uh--

12:53.656 --> 12:55.172
S-- see this woman just
sits next to me, I don't know.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.008
And-- first of all she
was sitting over there,

12:57.010 --> 12:59.210
and then she sits next to me,
starts laughing and smiling,

12:59.212 --> 13:03.915
and doing these weird things with her
face and then ordering drink after drink--

13:03.917 --> 13:06.207
Two drinks.

13:06.208 --> 13:08.498
And then talkin' about ooh,
how she can just fall in love

13:08.499 --> 13:10.789
with some man when she sees him walk through the door,
like she's fallen in love with me.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.123
Well,
I meant-- I meant that--

13:12.125 --> 13:14.476
And so I don't know
if you're in on it.

13:14.477 --> 13:16.828
I know-- I know some establishments do that,
they scam--

13:16.830 --> 13:19.864
This is a family restaurant.
We have a children's menu.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.367
I can pay for my own drinks.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.237
Okay, I-- I
don't have my purse.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.040
Oh! Oh, she doesn't have
her purse, what a surprise.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.375
I'd-- you know.

13:32.579 --> 13:36.047
I have-- I've
had enough of this.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.816
So thank you.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.185
Sorry.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.888
Oh, just--

13:51.598 --> 13:55.567
You know, you should
be ashamed of yourself!

13:59.606 --> 14:03.174
[Cal] Everyone saw it.
Everyone. [Laughing]

14:03.977 --> 14:05.944
Oh my God,
I can't stop laughing.

14:05.946 --> 14:09.881
Apparently, I am only man
who has ever proposed to her.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.250
Who knew?
I'll talk to you later.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.153
Bye, Mom.
Oh, be sure to tell Dad.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.989
What time is it in Spain?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.858
You are not calling our son.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.926
Yeah, he is probably asleep.

14:21.928 --> 14:25.563
[Chuckles] My sister.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.868
[Cal] Kara?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.092
- Maggie?
- Yes.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.627
- Kevin?
- Definitely.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.528
Maybe just a touch more spice.

14:57.530 --> 15:02.901
[Sniffing] Don't you think
it smells like despair?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.437
And rejection.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.273
It's strawberry
and cinnamon tea.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.041
Maybe it's me
that smells like that.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.144
Oh, can't tell.
Can we change its smell?

15:13.146 --> 15:14.579
Oh of course,
we can change the smell.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.081
To something that doesn't
cause cancer and kill people.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.416
Maybe not.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.288
If only we could add a dash
of optimism and a cry for help,

15:23.290 --> 15:25.390
then we'd really have
a product that sells.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.558
Isabel, your 10:00 is here.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.993
Who-- who's my 10:00?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.695
Uh, an office supply salesman.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.231
He said that he can beat the prices that Cardona is giving us.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.151
Yes. Send him in.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.070
So the strawberry cinnamon tea?
If we can't add hope and happiness?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.040
Ask them to try
a touch more cinnamon.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.558
I, uh-- I-- I just remembered
something I have to do.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.464
Well, I uh--

16:07.233 --> 16:08.566
I have lots to do.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.504
I am the president
of this company.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.741
That's my name, right there.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.127
- Oh!
- Me.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.512
Yeah, it's a small company,
we make tasty teas, but uh, keeps me busy.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.682
And this is one of those times,
when I am busy.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.385
Maggie, can you handle Mr.--

16:27.387 --> 16:29.120
- Mace-- Um.
- Whatever.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.722
So, oh my God.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.124
She's...

16:34.527 --> 16:36.260
...the president
of the company.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.196
Women are
allowed to do that now.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.631
No, I d-- I
didn't mean that.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.500
I-- I'm-- um, d--

16:45.205 --> 16:46.137
Sorry.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.307
Um, stop, sir! Please, stop!

16:50.677 --> 16:51.609
Wait.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.413
He'd like to see you.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.382
Mr. Office
Supplies Salesman.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.252
Well, I don't
want to speak to him.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.121
Okay, that makes sense,
because his products are really crappy like his pen.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.521
Leaked all over me.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.492
Please tell him
to go fuck himself.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.231
Hi. I just wanted
one minute, please.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.800
Thank you, Maggie.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.169
Okay.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.773
I just wanted to apologize for what happened on Saturday night.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.709
Let's just end
this right here.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.643
I-- I-- I mean-- I-- you know,
I thought you were a hooker.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.147
You made
your thoughts very clear.

17:29.149 --> 17:34.786
I just wish there was something
I could do to make up for um--

17:34.788 --> 17:38.423
Uh, I was
having a horrible day.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.743
And so was I.

17:41.744 --> 17:45.062
Again, I'm afraid I don't have time for you,
I have another meeting, and decisions to make.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.799
I'm a productive,
fairly successful person.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.434
How can I word this?

17:50.070 --> 17:53.104
A woman who can
pay for her own drinks.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.639
Could I buy you dinner?

17:54.641 --> 17:57.775
Why on Earth
would I ever agree to--

18:02.382 --> 18:04.449
Please. Are you free tonight?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.298
Hey.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.837
- We should watch that movie tonight.
- Sorry, I have a thing tonight.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.673
Didn't I tell you?
A-- a thing.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.242
I thought you wanted to see that movie.
The one with women.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.677
And have a quiet evening in?

18:33.346 --> 18:34.445
I was gonna cook.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.547
- You were gonna cook?
- Spaghetti.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.149
Your favorite.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.117
Oh!

18:39.119 --> 18:40.118
Well...

18:41.855 --> 18:45.223
Maybe I-- I
could skip the thing.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.677
Great.

18:49.678 --> 18:50.594
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.332
- How was your day?
- Yeah.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.135
- We're testing a new tea.
- Hmm.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.269
I had a great day.

18:58.271 --> 19:02.173
I told Hank about you
and that guy at the restaurant.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.643
Oh my God, he
couldn't stop laughing.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.614
So then he starts asking everybody else if they'd been proposed to.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.681
He had one.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.884
And you know who had the most?

19:12.886 --> 19:13.784
Ellen.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.586
Five.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.557
And she's not
even that pretty.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.627
You know what, I think
I should go to my thing.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.728
Yeah.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.863
Really shouldn't miss it.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.432
Are you sure?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.768
Don't wait up.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.841
I told you
there was construction.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.743
- Stop.
- No, but I told you.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.745
Why did we have
to do the same route?

19:42.615 --> 19:43.915
Fuck you.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.950
Just fuck, fuck.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.385
Fuck you!

19:47.387 --> 19:48.352
Hi.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.453
Hi.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.788
You okay?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.491
Just one of those days.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.592
Weeks.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.395
We were all gonna get
together one of these days.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.664
Oh yeah, we--
we should do that.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.832
You look like you got
a special night ahead of you.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.335
Yeah, maybe I do.
Yeah, we'll see.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.536
You look amazing.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.205
Thanks.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.307
Oh, I won't be staying.
I don't think she's coming.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.725
Oh. Um, uh--

21:00.727 --> 21:01.759
- [thud]
- Oh!

21:05.265 --> 21:06.931
- I'm sorry, I'm late.
- No, no.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.567
N-- n-- no, no,
not at all. No, you--

21:10.937 --> 21:13.471
You are a woman
worth waiting for.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.606
Um, uh.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.376
Um, thank you.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.811
I didn't think you'd come.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.753
I-- I keep saying, "Albert,
pinch yourself. You must be dreaming."

21:28.755 --> 21:31.706
- Dreaming?
- Well--

21:31.707 --> 21:34.658
I mean,
I think that's what was wrong on Saturday night. I-- I--

21:35.295 --> 21:39.964
I thought that a wo-- woman like that
couldn't possibly be interested in me.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.433
- I--
- Oh! Okay, I thought--

21:42.435 --> 21:43.801
I mean you're so...

21:46.072 --> 21:48.939
- Really, I thought--
- And-- and-- and--

21:48.941 --> 21:51.409
Um, and president of a company.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.911
Oh, it's a small company.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.681
We're really just
scraping by, it's a lot of work.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.516
That's so impressive.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.918
You know, I-- God,
I hate my job sometimes.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.405
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's such a shame.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.891
It used to be okay, but um,
then this guy bought the company and he is not a nice man.

22:07.894 --> 22:12.063
He lowered the standard of the merchandise,
so nobody wants to buy it anymore.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.631
And he-- he treats us--

22:13.633 --> 22:16.534
Well, I--

22:17.603 --> 22:20.404
I wanted to take
the day off today for um...

22:21.941 --> 22:25.443
Yeah, just
a family matter, and um--

22:27.080 --> 22:28.546
He just said, "No way".

22:29.082 --> 22:30.348
He screamed at me.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.416
That's terrible.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.353
So what did you do?

22:39.926 --> 22:40.958
Nothing.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.895
You should stand up to him.
Tell him he can't talk to you like that.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.633
- Do you think so?
- Absolutely. Life's too short.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.369
Do you find life short? I--

22:52.905 --> 22:55.473
I find it kind
of long sometimes.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.909
Then you're not
living it the right way.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.445
Up until now.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.922
Yeah, you know, I-- I
will have the chocolate cake.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.161
And then what made you
go into sales?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.797
Well, I liked
product management--

23:19.799 --> 23:22.666
Well, you know, as much
as anyone likes their job,

23:22.668 --> 23:27.405
but um, then the new owner,
that Ed that I told you about,

23:27.774 --> 23:32.643
he gave my job to his son
and moved me to sales.

23:32.645 --> 23:37.148
And I-- a-- any-- anyway, you know,
you don't want to hear any more about me.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.083
Uh, um.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.017
Um-- um, uh, you've told me
almost nothing about your life.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.588
Well, your family,
where you live or--

23:46.559 --> 23:47.992
I already know
everything about me.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.428
What about your family?

23:50.430 --> 23:54.765
I just-- Oh, it's just
been me and my mother.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.568
Aw, that's sweet,
a man who is close to his mom.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.438
You have a wedding ring.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.540
Oh.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.175
Oh!

24:05.478 --> 24:07.445
You didn't
the other night, I don't think.

24:08.514 --> 24:09.447
No.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.549
But yes. Yes, I-- I do.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.851
I-- I have a wedding
ring on at this moment.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.453
Because um...

24:15.455 --> 24:19.557
Oh, this is
embarrassing, but um,

24:20.493 --> 24:23.093
sometimes men I-- in my job--

24:23.095 --> 24:25.496
I mean not my employees
or I would fire them.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.997
But sometimes uh--

24:28.835 --> 24:30.601
Women don't like
to be bothered.

24:30.603 --> 24:34.205
I mean, younger women get this
so much more than I do,

24:34.207 --> 24:37.208
but you'd be surprised,
anyone would be surprised,

24:37.210 --> 24:40.644
I mean it sounds almost
unbelievable, doesn't it,

24:40.646 --> 24:45.516
that I-- I would have to wear a fake wedding
ring to discourage unwanted advances.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.061
Of course!

24:59.599 --> 25:00.831
And why didn't I think of that?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.236
- A woman as lovely as you are--
- Oh.

25:05.238 --> 25:06.570
- As successful---
- Oh--

25:06.572 --> 25:08.038
- As charming--
- Really, it's just a--

25:08.040 --> 25:09.874
Men must chase
you all the time. I--

25:10.643 --> 25:12.977
Oh. Oh, excuse me.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.616
Oh.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.018
Uh, oh, I'm sorry,
I-- I've got to leave.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.286
- Um--
- Oh!

25:22.288 --> 25:24.154
- Let me pay for my dinner.
- No, no.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.891
- Uh, um--
- Sorry, I have got to rush.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.794
- You had a friend--
- What?

25:30.796 --> 25:31.795
Text you.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.031
No, I-- I
wouldn't do that--

25:34.033 --> 25:35.966
I know that's what women do,
I've read about it.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.735
Th-- this is
a real emergency.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.905
Well, then go.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.142
Oh, wait. Wait, wait!
Can I see you again?

26:01.027 --> 26:02.192
[Cal] Isabel!

26:03.863 --> 26:05.229
What happened?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.865
I was loading the dishwasher
when my back went "pop".

26:08.568 --> 26:12.069
You texted,
"Come home now, urgent."

26:12.071 --> 26:13.571
In capitals.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.139
I thought something
had happened to Colin.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.007
Well, actually
he emailed earlier.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.642
He's having
a great time in Barcelona.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.010
I don't think
he's missing us at all.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.912
Well, I kept calling,
you didn't answer-

26:21.914 --> 26:23.814
I left the phone
in the kitchen.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.584
Yeah. I could hear it,
but I really couldn't get to it.

26:26.586 --> 26:30.721
- Is there any chance for a massage?
- I can't believe this.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.142
[Cal] Oh, come on!

26:34.143 --> 26:36.327
You don't like those business things anyway,
I thought I was doing you a favor.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.928
Oh God!

26:50.276 --> 26:53.944
[Isabel] And don't forget to tell shipping
about the new order going to Kingston,

26:53.946 --> 26:56.514
I don't want it to be late.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.083
If we can get them as regular customers,
that would be great, and we need--

27:03.122 --> 27:04.288
Surprise.

27:04.924 --> 27:05.856
Uh-ha!

27:07.259 --> 27:08.292
Uh...

27:10.630 --> 27:14.164
Uh, guy-- guys, would you give
Albert and I a quick minute?

27:14.166 --> 27:15.866
Oh, Albert?

27:19.271 --> 27:24.375
Um, would you like to take this
meeting with the door open or...

27:24.377 --> 27:27.244
No, close it please.

27:38.691 --> 27:41.325
So I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd pop by--

27:41.327 --> 27:43.661
No, I wasn't-- I wasn't--
I wasn't in the neighborhood.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.130
I made a-- a special trip.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.333
Well, thank you.
These are uh, really pretty--

27:49.335 --> 27:52.019
I've had the most amazing
morning ever,

27:52.020 --> 27:54.704
but uh, before I tell you about that,
how was the emergency?

27:54.707 --> 27:57.341
- Everything alright?
- Uh, not that big a deal after all.

27:57.343 --> 28:02.046
Uh, you know, I-- I'm afraid
I'm in the middle of something.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.716
What you said about a stranger
walking into the door,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.318
I've felt that so often.

28:09.055 --> 28:12.056
I-- you know, is there someone
out there for me,

28:12.058 --> 28:14.825
and if there is,
if she walks in the room, will I know it?

28:14.827 --> 28:17.361
Will I-- am I gonna
do anything? And you--

28:18.798 --> 28:20.431
You were so brave.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.833
You sat right next to me and...

28:23.436 --> 28:27.438
Uh, well, I really
wanted a glass of wine.

28:27.440 --> 28:31.141
So uh, you know what?
I really need to return some calls.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.945
Those things you said
about that young boy you know--

28:34.947 --> 28:36.447
You know, in Dublin.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.882
You were listening?
I was just rambling.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.284
I've never heard
anything like that.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.753
Not the, you know,
dancing down the street part.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.857
I-- I don't
even know if I've--

28:46.859 --> 28:48.759
If I've ever
really been in love.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.462
I mean not--

28:51.464 --> 28:58.102
not like what I could
feel for the right person.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.172
Well, is anyone
really the right person?

29:02.174 --> 29:03.974
Pfft. Who knows?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.076
Life is m-- messy.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.244
My mother died.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.014
What?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.982
That's why I was drinking
alone on a Saturday night.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.284
I'm not usually a drinker.
You know, my mother just--

29:15.855 --> 29:17.755
What do they call it now?
Passed.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.990
Passed what? Passed an exam.

29:19.992 --> 29:24.128
Passed an exam. It's sounds like if you get a B plus,
you're going to get to die.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.231
I had no idea.
Oh my God, I--

29:28.300 --> 29:30.534
- I should have left you alone.
- No, no, no, that--

29:30.536 --> 29:33.771
That was wonderful.
It was-- it was wonderful.

29:35.074 --> 29:39.476
It was her funeral,
um, yesterday afternoon.

29:40.546 --> 29:44.414
But you were here yesterday,
your sales call in the morning.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.718
That's what I was
telling you about at dinner.

29:47.719 --> 29:51.021
So my boss wouldn't give me the whole day off for my mother's funeral.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.056
Well, it's just a half day.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.558
I mean, he-- he
just likes to be mean.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.160
Anyway, that is done.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.929
That's what I was here to tell
you about, what you said--

29:58.931 --> 30:00.297
What did I say?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.800
About to stand up to him.

30:02.802 --> 30:06.804
So this morning I marched into the office and I really told him off.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.140
In front of everyone.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.810
Oh, well--

30:13.479 --> 30:14.411
Good for you.

30:16.415 --> 30:20.150
Oh, I should uh,
really get back to--

30:20.152 --> 30:23.387
Of course you would you know,
it's your own company.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.156
But we are having
dinner again tonight.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.457
I don't think I can.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.961
Well, then--- then
uh, tomorrow night it is.

30:33.065 --> 30:37.234
I'm uh, quite busy these days.

30:39.872 --> 30:40.838
Sorry.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.876
I could be busy
for quite a while.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.248
Alright, yeah.

30:59.325 --> 31:02.593
Oh yeah, well, then it's
goodbye. Uh, of course.

31:05.598 --> 31:08.932
I uh, um, you know, I won't--
I won't bother you anymore.

31:08.934 --> 31:13.604
Just if-- if you do--
if you have time ever--

31:13.606 --> 31:15.105
I, um...

31:16.442 --> 31:19.109
Here's my-- here,
this is my personal card.

31:19.111 --> 31:22.579
- Uh, that's my personal cell, so um uh--
- Thanks.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.483
Um, well, so bye.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.918
- Bye.
- Oh dear.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.088
Thanks, thank you so much.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.890
I'll close it.

32:21.173 --> 32:25.375
There's a salesman here from that office
supply company with the leaky pens.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.577
- Oh, he came back!
- No. No, it's a different guy.

32:27.579 --> 32:31.515
And I told him that we'd already said no,
but he's being really insistent.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.351
- I could just tell him to get lost.
- No, no, it's okay.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.619
Okay. Uh, sir?

32:35.621 --> 32:36.687
There you go.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.190
- Oh, hey.
- Great.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.692
Hey, how you doin' today?
Uh, I'm Ralph Pinson.

32:41.694 --> 32:45.095
And you are
the head honcho, I'm told.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.497
- Mm-hmm, Isabel Llewellyn.
- You like markers?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.399
'Cause guess what?
Boom. We got 'em.

32:49.401 --> 32:53.236
We had a salesman from your company here a week or so ago?

32:53.238 --> 32:56.006
Um, he's no longer
with the company.

32:56.008 --> 32:59.176
- Oh?
- Yeah, um, just between you and me.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.712
Uh, he had
a freak-out in the office.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.714
Yeah, comes in
one morning last week

33:03.716 --> 33:05.716
and starts
screaming at the owner,

33:05.718 --> 33:08.418
wanted a day off
for some little personal thing.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.355
It's always
the quiet ones, right?

33:12.124 --> 33:15.325
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this right.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.529
You tried to get an absolute
stranger to propose to you?

33:20.199 --> 33:22.165
Did you have
a timeframe for this?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.651
I mean-- I mean you're
a good-looking woman,

33:24.652 --> 33:27.136
but-- but did you actually expect to accomplish this just in one evening?

33:27.139 --> 33:31.508
I asked you-- I begged you
not to tell this story again.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.377
Oh no, it's a good story!

33:33.379 --> 33:35.829
Yeah,
how could I resist, right?

33:35.830 --> 33:38.280
'Cause even Marilyn Monroe would have thought,
I might need two evenings.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.972
I lost my temper,
my brain wasn't working,

33:44.973 --> 33:48.158
but obviously I wasn't gonna make some
stranger fall for me and then dump him.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.126
That would be--

33:50.162 --> 33:51.328
That would be cruel.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.764
Oh, she says that now.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.199
But at the time she thought she could get this guy to propose to her.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.470
No, I never set out to do that.
I just thought--

34:01.340 --> 34:04.608
If I thought anything,
I'll chat this guy up,

34:04.610 --> 34:08.678
maybe get him to ask for my number and prove that I'm--

34:10.783 --> 34:12.449
He was clearly
upset about something.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.068
I-- I should
have left him alone.

34:15.069 --> 34:17.686
Most people have only had one
proposal, right? If that.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.690
Actually, I've been conducting
an informal survey

34:20.692 --> 34:26.763
and on average so far women have 3.2,
and I admit men only get 0.4.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.299
- What?
- What?

34:29.301 --> 34:33.335
Now, I've only had one.
Oh no, there was that guy.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.804
Does it count if he's drunk?

34:37.643 --> 34:38.574
No.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.148
- Sorry.
- Life isn't a game.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.484
People have
feelings, they get hurt.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.554
Excuse me.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.688
Isabel, come on.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.792
I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.694
It's a joke!

34:59.631 --> 35:01.431
I shouldn't have
mentioned the drunk guy.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.141
Albert?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.147
Do you want us to leave?

35:17.149 --> 35:18.782
No, no, no.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.416
It's no big deal. She'll be
back in a minute.

35:21.854 --> 35:25.322
Okay, I am stunned that that
woman only had one proposal.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.390
I mean if I had met
her when I was single.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.360
Really?

35:30.361 --> 35:32.161
You have to mention that while I'm sitting right across from you?

35:32.164 --> 35:33.130
Stop it.

35:34.867 --> 35:36.766
Maybe I should go check on her.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.622
I'm going out.

35:41.623 --> 35:43.740
Isabel, if the roles had been reversed you would have told everyone.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.876
It's not-- it's--
it's not what you think.

35:45.878 --> 35:48.278
Isabel, we have guests.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.646
I've got to go. Bye.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.351
I'm just gonna put this on the table,
no one's ever proposed to me.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.286
[Door closes]

35:56.287 --> 35:58.220
Huh, some of us
wouldn't be surprised by that.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.662
Isabel.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.397
Hi, uh--

36:46.538 --> 36:49.639
[Albert vomiting]

36:54.846 --> 36:59.950
Okay, drink this, it's our ginger tea,
it'll help your stomach.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.985
Well, I don't know
if it really works, but--

37:01.987 --> 37:03.720
I should never have
told you where I live.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.855
Put down the bottle.
Drink this instead.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.658
And now you'll find out
that I lived with my mother,

37:08.660 --> 37:11.328
but I-- I had to have her
here, she was sick.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.729
- Well, I don't care.
- I--

37:14.266 --> 37:15.665
I need a mint.
Do you have any?

37:15.667 --> 37:17.634
Mm. I-- I gotta--

37:17.636 --> 37:20.237
I've just
gotta clean my teeth.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.972
- Maybe I have one--
- I've got--

37:21.974 --> 37:24.541
No, I've just
got teabags in here.

37:25.611 --> 37:28.578
You should try this,
in case it helps.

37:30.249 --> 37:33.416
[Mumbling]

37:33.418 --> 37:36.319
Oh, uh-- uh, I'm sorry,
I can't tell what you're saying.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.695
In case you wanna kiss me.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.930
I won't. No. Uh, Albert,
it's not that kind of visit.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.799
It's really not.
Please, drink this.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.769
I'm-- I'm gonna have
a little bit of this instead.

37:53.538 --> 37:56.740
Put the bottle down.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.943
I think you coming
here means you love me.

38:00.545 --> 38:04.014
No. No, no, no, it doesn't.
I-- I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

38:04.016 --> 38:06.816
You-- you sounded
in-- in really bad shape.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.619
You say you loved me.

38:10.289 --> 38:11.588
I never-- no!

38:11.590 --> 38:13.523
You said
you fell in love with me

38:13.525 --> 38:16.760
when you saw me walk through
the door in the restaurant.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.462
No, no, no,
I-- I meant-- I--

38:19.464 --> 38:21.765
I-- I-- did
not use that word.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.601
I-- it-- it was
a lot more complicated.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.736
Love is simple.
It's not complicated.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.771
It's not.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.806
Oh, it is.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.311
It really is.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.780
When you loved me, that-- just
that little bit of time,

38:36.782 --> 38:40.817
this tiny bit off--
that tiny bit of time,

38:40.819 --> 38:42.886
when you loved me-- when--

38:42.888 --> 38:48.892
I knew you weren't a hooker
and uh, I felt invincible!

38:48.894 --> 38:51.928
And then I did what you
told me, I said to my boss.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.565
You got-- you got not
right to treat me like that!

38:55.567 --> 38:58.401
And it just felt so
good until he fired me.

38:58.403 --> 39:01.771
- No.
- I'm really sorry for everything.

39:01.773 --> 39:06.443
No! I'm free! I'm free!
It's wonderful.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.945
Oh no, it's wonderful.
I don't know what I'm gonna all day.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.514
I just-- I'm so--
I'm gonna run out--

39:11.516 --> 39:13.016
Soon I'm gonna
run out of mommy.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.787
Money. Money.
I didn't-- I never called her "mommy."

39:19.458 --> 39:23.093
I call-- I called
her "mother" and then--

39:25.864 --> 39:27.630
And now, she's gone.

39:27.632 --> 39:28.631
And that's--

39:31.937 --> 39:35.472
And I miss her, actually.

39:36.108 --> 39:41.144
And um, I don't know why,
'cause she drove me crazy.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.914
But when she-- she--

39:43.915 --> 39:46.683
I had to bring her over from England,
'cause she was getting confused,

39:46.685 --> 39:50.687
and then she got cancer,
and what else could I do?

39:52.758 --> 39:54.391
What else could I do?

39:54.393 --> 39:57.394
I couldn't-- you
know, but she really--

39:58.029 --> 40:01.431
She really got on my nerves.

40:02.067 --> 40:07.170
I-- I used to say,
"When will I get my life back?"

40:07.172 --> 40:09.806
That's horrible, isn't it?
She's my mother.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.409
Why wasn't I
nicer to my mother?

40:13.011 --> 40:15.145
We all feel like that
when our mothers die.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.414
She knew you loved her.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.549
Mums do.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.050
I just didn't want her
to die on her own,

40:21.052 --> 40:24.554
I didn't want her to die
in somewhere stinkin' of piss.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.857
And I got a nurse for her,
and you know, when I went to work,

40:27.859 --> 40:30.960
and you know, I didn't have--
I didn't earn that much money.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.163
I mean we were not
those kind of people.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.497
You know, she worked--

40:35.634 --> 40:37.634
Is that why you
stopped loving me?

40:38.670 --> 40:41.438
'Cause I'm not the president
of a tea bag company?

40:41.440 --> 40:43.173
No, of course not.

40:43.175 --> 40:49.446
I don't care about things like that and I
actually earn a lot less than you think.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.582
So am I still
gonna get one chance?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.854
- Yes.
- No.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.088
Yes.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.523
- No.
- No.

41:02.661 --> 41:03.960
Yes.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.197
Albert, that is
not going to happen.

41:07.199 --> 41:08.665
Ever.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.669
Oh, fuck it!

41:13.839 --> 41:15.772
Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

41:15.774 --> 41:18.241
Come on, give me the bottle.
You've had enough to drink.

41:18.243 --> 41:22.078
No! I can still feel.
I want the pain to go away.

41:22.080 --> 41:26.950
I wanna feel absolutely
nothing, but things still hurt.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.251
They-- look, watch.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.486
Oh!

41:32.057 --> 41:32.989
Oh!

41:34.826 --> 41:35.859
Fuck!

41:39.164 --> 41:42.031
I'm gonna be another
couple of hours maybe.

41:42.667 --> 41:43.800
Uh...

41:43.802 --> 41:45.535
Isabel.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.237
- Uh, it's a long story.
- Isabel!

41:47.239 --> 41:49.940
Uh, I'll explain
when I get home.

41:49.941 --> 41:52.642
I-- I just called, because I didn't want you to worry.
No, no, I'm fine.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.911
Uh, I'm not still mad.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.580
Well, I am,
but I mean not because--

41:57.582 --> 41:59.549
Oh, look,
I-- I've gotta go.

41:59.551 --> 42:00.884
- Bye.
- [Doctor] Mr. Mace?

42:00.886 --> 42:04.521
Who wants to know?
Where's Isabel?

42:05.757 --> 42:07.090
- Hi.
- Oh.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.527
- Are you his wife?
- Maybe soon.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.279
Uh, I'm a friend.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.597
Okay, well, we have the X-ray
results and the CT scan.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.100
How did you
receive your injury?

42:17.102 --> 42:21.004
I hit myself over the head
with a bottle of vodka.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.674
O-- okay.

42:24.675 --> 42:27.176
Well, uh,
under normal circumstances I would recommend

42:27.178 --> 42:31.648
a psych evaluation,
but your alcohol level is pretty high.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.983
- So--
- His mother died recently.

42:34.986 --> 42:37.620
Anyway, it looks
like you have a concussion.

42:38.290 --> 42:40.957
Why do you keep
checking my head?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.192
It's my heart that hurts.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.260
You have chest pain?

42:44.262 --> 42:47.897
Okay, I did not know that.
We're gonna have to get a few more tests.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.999
- I think he means that--
- She did it.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.168
So you're-- you're--
you're the one that hit him?

42:52.170 --> 42:53.937
In the-- in the chest
or the head?

42:53.939 --> 42:56.039
Uh, I think he
means it's broken.

42:56.708 --> 43:00.243
- His heart.
- She loved me and then suddenly "poof".

43:00.912 --> 43:03.630
She stopped.

43:03.631 --> 43:06.349
But I'm gonna win her back,
you know, if it's the last thing I do.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.085
Okay, just-- just
calm down, okay, Mr. Mace.

43:09.087 --> 43:12.722
She's not really married.

43:12.724 --> 43:17.794
She just wears a wedding ring,
so men will leave her alone.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.364
- Okay, can we have a word? In-- in private?
- Yes. Yeah, of course.

43:21.366 --> 43:24.801
Hey, hey! Don't try
to steal my girlfriend.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.369
I-- I promise I'll
bring her right back.

43:26.371 --> 43:30.607
Oh, I should never have told you
she was single. Damn it.

43:30.609 --> 43:33.776
- I should explain, maybe--
- You-- no, it's-- it's -- it's your business.

43:33.778 --> 43:37.246
- [Phone ringing]
- Uh, but you do seem very popular.

43:38.149 --> 43:42.819
You know,
he's gonna feel a lot better as the painkillers kick in.

43:42.821 --> 43:44.804
Oh, good.

43:44.805 --> 43:46.788
But basically,
I'm undecided on whether to order some cardiac tests for him--

43:46.791 --> 43:50.059
Oh, I'm pretty certain he means
the other kind of heart trouble.

43:50.695 --> 43:53.129
- That-- that heart.
- Okay.

43:54.232 --> 43:57.800
Uh, I-- I think he's just
a drunk sad man

43:57.802 --> 44:01.270
with a mild concussion
and a complicated love life.

44:02.073 --> 44:04.273
He doesn't belong here,
exposed to infections,

44:04.275 --> 44:07.310
plus the state that he's in,
he's gonna be disruptive to other patients,

44:07.312 --> 44:11.681
and we'd probably have to put him in
restraints which would be pretty horrible.

44:12.183 --> 44:15.852
So I think what's best for him is just to go home and sleep it off.

44:15.854 --> 44:16.986
Okay.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.723
With someone watching over him,

44:20.725 --> 44:24.227
waking him up every two hours
the entire night.

44:26.131 --> 44:29.032
I'll uh, I'll
see that it's done.

44:29.034 --> 44:30.133
You sure?

44:30.135 --> 44:32.402
Because he cannot be alone.

44:32.404 --> 44:35.438
If he's fine in the morning,
then sure, he can be alone again.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.041
No, I can do it. I promise.

44:38.043 --> 44:40.276
- [Phone ringing]
- Hey!

44:40.278 --> 44:44.047
I told you not
to steal my girlfriend.

44:44.049 --> 44:45.048
Uh.

44:50.221 --> 44:53.790
Why is it put
on my fingers and--

44:55.427 --> 44:56.426
Watch it.

44:56.428 --> 44:57.894
- Just not bad.
- Uh, Albert.

44:57.896 --> 44:59.729
- Uh, Albert, this way.
- I did it-- of course--

44:59.731 --> 45:01.097
- Here. This way.
- What?

45:01.099 --> 45:02.932
This? Oh, let's dance.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.435
- Let's-- Let's dance right now.
- No, no, no.

45:05.437 --> 45:07.470
- You're supposed to rest.
- No, I don't wanna rest--

45:07.472 --> 45:09.439
- I wanna dance.
- I have to get you home.

45:09.441 --> 45:12.041
- No, I don't wanna go home. I just--
- Well, you-- you have to!

45:12.043 --> 45:13.910
My-- my mother died there.

45:13.912 --> 45:17.180
You know, I can't
take it there, you know?

45:18.149 --> 45:22.351
Let's go to like a four-star
hotel and have like a champagne.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.754
- Oh shit, I know my credit card's ma--
- Albert.

45:24.756 --> 45:26.456
- Maxed out.
- I-- I have to get you home.

45:26.458 --> 45:31.094
I-- what?
Why don't we-- why don't we go to your place?

45:31.096 --> 45:33.196
- That's not possible.
- It's possible.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.065
Or well-- whoa!

45:37.469 --> 45:41.003
Look, well, it's your place
or I sit here all night!

45:44.509 --> 45:46.776
Albert, I can't take you there!

45:46.778 --> 45:48.077
Why not?

45:49.247 --> 45:51.013
[Phone ringing]

45:51.816 --> 45:54.117
Who is it who keeps
calling you all the time?

45:54.119 --> 45:56.185
Someone calling, calling.

45:56.187 --> 45:57.320
Who is it?

45:57.322 --> 45:59.422
Is it some-- is
it someone I should--

45:59.424 --> 46:01.090
Okay, okay, okay!

46:02.927 --> 46:04.861
Let's go to my place.

46:05.330 --> 46:06.429
Yes, let's!

46:07.165 --> 46:10.066
Wait a minute,
I'm-- I'm comin'.

46:11.970 --> 46:12.902
Okay.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.805
I'm much better, actually.

46:15.807 --> 46:17.039
I'm fine now.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.207
I'm absolutely fine.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.814
- Okay, here we are.
- Oh, this is nice.

46:24.816 --> 46:28.251
This-- these are-- I-- I've only ever lived in apartments.

46:28.253 --> 46:32.522
Listen, maybe after we marry,
we should live in your place and not mine.

46:32.524 --> 46:35.958
Have you-- do you ever-- Do you ever like dance on the lawn?

46:35.960 --> 46:37.527
- No.
- Maybe-- oh, come on.

46:37.529 --> 46:40.062
I want to dance with you
like the boy who made you happy.

46:40.799 --> 46:44.400
Just-- yeah. Come on, hey!

46:45.170 --> 46:46.435
Albert!

46:47.105 --> 46:48.905
- Please stop.
- Okay.

46:50.575 --> 46:52.175
Oh, oh, uh.

46:53.545 --> 46:58.881
[Humming a song]

47:00.185 --> 47:01.184
Okay, I'm coming.

47:02.554 --> 47:04.587
Oh my God! Oh, you're home.

47:04.589 --> 47:05.555
Hi.

47:07.125 --> 47:09.258
- You're okay?
- You're still here!

47:09.260 --> 47:11.227
- Of course.
- Yeah, we were all so worried!

47:11.229 --> 47:13.730
Yeah, I almost
called the police.

47:13.731 --> 47:16.232
You know, it sounded like you were at the hospital,
I was pretty worried.

47:16.234 --> 47:19.335
- Oh, I'm fine. Just fine.
- So what happened?

47:20.505 --> 47:22.271
- Uh, so uh--
- [Albert] Isabel!

47:22.273 --> 47:23.573
- Oh yeah.
- Who is that?

47:23.575 --> 47:25.007
Oh! Oh!

47:26.945 --> 47:29.946
Oh, you have roommates.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.881
Nice to meet you. No, ow!

47:31.883 --> 47:33.416
Ouch, I'm sorry. Hello.

47:33.418 --> 47:35.151
Hello. Hello.

47:35.153 --> 47:36.853
- Hello.
- Yeah.

47:36.855 --> 47:37.854
Albert.

47:38.456 --> 47:40.189
Hello, Albert.

47:40.191 --> 47:44.393
I think that-- I think
I might need to vomit again.

47:45.230 --> 47:47.063
- Right through there.
- Okay.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.166
I'll be right back, darling.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.947
I can explain, sort of.

48:04.949 --> 48:06.966
Who is that?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.984
That's the guy from the restaurant,
Saturday night.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.354
- The bet!
- Oh my God!

48:11.356 --> 48:14.490
Okay, that's the first thing.
No one mentions the bet.

48:14.492 --> 48:16.993
Do you understand? Under no
circumstances whatsoever.

48:16.995 --> 48:20.229
You promise me or I will
walk right out that door again.

48:21.299 --> 48:22.899
Okay, I promise.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.668
- Okay.
- Okay, whatever you need.

48:25.670 --> 48:31.440
Okay, I met him again
by accident. It's the truth!

48:32.510 --> 48:35.077
And then we-- we had dinner.

48:35.079 --> 48:37.346
- You went on a date with another man.
- Oh my God.

48:37.348 --> 48:40.016
That's not the important
part of the story.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.485
I think that is
the important part of the story.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.453
I don't have long,
he'll be back in a minute.

48:44.455 --> 48:47.590
His mother died,
he lost his job because of me,

48:47.592 --> 48:51.494
he got a concussion,
and then he hurt his hand trying to punch a doctor.

48:51.496 --> 48:55.231
- I'm supposed to care about this loser?
- We are the bad people here.

48:55.233 --> 48:56.165
We?

48:56.167 --> 48:58.467
I have never
spoken to that man.

48:58.469 --> 49:01.203
- You goaded me on.
- I did not.

49:01.205 --> 49:03.956
- I kind of think you did.
- Honey, we weren't there.

49:03.957 --> 49:06.708
Well, all Cal has been talking about is Isabel
only had one proposal and he's had two.

49:06.711 --> 49:10.112
I'm just saying,
I'm begging you, be kind to him.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.415
- What's he doing in my home?
- Our home.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.985
And he can't be alone tonight,
because of the concussion!

49:15.987 --> 49:18.721
So call his family
or call his friends.

49:18.722 --> 49:21.456
I don't know if there is anyone and he's so drunk uh,
and confused.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.626
This is a stranger
my wife went on a date with.

49:23.628 --> 49:27.997
- I don't care about him.
- I promised the doctor I would stay with him tonight.

49:27.999 --> 49:31.100
What would you rather I went to his apartment?
I don't think so.

49:31.102 --> 49:32.969
- Yeah, she's got a point there.
- Max.

49:32.971 --> 49:34.370
Why don't you
think about what I want?

49:34.372 --> 49:36.706
And I want him
out of my house!

49:36.708 --> 49:38.474
Come on, this is insane!

49:41.746 --> 49:44.480
False alarm.
What are we doing, huh?

49:44.482 --> 49:47.316
We're gonna have
a game of charades?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.418
It really is--
have you got any vodka?

49:49.420 --> 49:53.723
No. And uh, you
need to lie down.

49:53.725 --> 49:56.325
- So uh, come through here.
- Oh!

49:56.761 --> 49:58.527
- Oh, this is nice.
- Yeah.

49:58.529 --> 50:01.330
- I like this.
- Yeah, okay, so just lie down.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.331
Lie down?

50:03.234 --> 50:05.134
And I'm gonna set an alarm--

50:06.004 --> 50:07.737
- Lie down over here?
- For two hours.

50:07.739 --> 50:10.373
Two hours? Thanks, darling.

50:10.375 --> 50:12.208
Now I've got
all ticklish feet.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.743
Oh, and she
takes his shoes off.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.380
I put my back out,
I got nothing. Nothing!

50:17.382 --> 50:19.382
Okay, so just close your eyes.

50:20.084 --> 50:22.351
- [Isabel] Yeah.
- Oh, no, no.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.652
Stay with me.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.087
You need to sleep.

50:25.089 --> 50:26.589
You know, I can't--

50:26.591 --> 50:29.558
Look, I will go to sleep if you
give me a little goodnight kiss.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.194
You cannot talk
to my wife like that.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.329
Oh fuck.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.066
Your wife?

50:38.403 --> 50:39.502
Isabel?

50:39.504 --> 50:44.206
She is my wife. We are married.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.674
No, she's not.

50:45.676 --> 50:51.747
She says she wears a wedding ring,
so all the men she meets won't try to sleep with her.

50:56.521 --> 50:58.371
Oh, you told him
that and he believed you?

50:58.372 --> 51:00.222
I didn't set a minimum IQ or say he had to be George Clooney, but--

51:00.224 --> 51:01.791
Don't. Don't go there.

51:01.793 --> 51:05.061
You know,
George Clooney-- She didn't sleep with George Clooney.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.596
I am not George Clooney.

51:07.598 --> 51:08.531
Lie down.

51:09.434 --> 51:10.633
Everything is gonna be fine.

51:10.635 --> 51:14.270
Of course, 'cause
you can divorce him.

51:15.073 --> 51:18.107
- [Albert] Happens all the time.
- Shh!

51:18.109 --> 51:19.892
Shh.

51:19.893 --> 51:21.676
You'll feel so much
better in the morning.

51:25.116 --> 51:26.148
[Cal] No.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.701
This man is not
staying in this house.

51:28.702 --> 51:31.253
Wake him up, get him out.
I don't care where you take him.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.422
I think it's like
the Pottery Barn rule.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.791
You break it, you buy it.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.261
At least, until he gets
glued back together again.

51:41.499 --> 51:43.766
- You're picking him over me?
- No!

51:43.768 --> 51:46.268
It's an extraordinary situation.

51:48.539 --> 51:49.772
Can I stay at your place?

51:49.774 --> 51:51.273
- Uh--
- Yes.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.393
Oh fuck.

52:13.331 --> 52:14.497
Oh!

52:40.491 --> 52:42.458
Oh! You're still awake.

52:42.927 --> 52:44.894
I was just bringing
you down an extra blanket.

52:44.896 --> 52:46.729
This room gets
so chilly at night.

52:46.731 --> 52:47.696
Thanks.

52:49.367 --> 52:52.168
- But you should be asleep.
- Oh, I can't sleep.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.406
Honestly, I just
find it so hard to believe.

52:57.408 --> 53:00.509
Isabel and that strange guy...

53:00.511 --> 53:02.444
I'm not the crazy one, right?

53:02.446 --> 53:06.482
Those bandages,
and the drinking, and the shorts.

53:06.484 --> 53:09.785
I mean I have to admit when I
first heard about all the,

53:09.787 --> 53:12.688
you know, how many proposals
thing, I thought, "Hmm."

53:13.658 --> 53:15.791
It was just a joke.
I didn't mean to you know--

53:15.793 --> 53:17.593
Yeah, but then when she--

53:17.595 --> 53:20.196
Was seeing him behind
my back just to win a bet.

53:20.198 --> 53:20.930
Damn.

53:23.267 --> 53:24.466
What would you do?

53:28.439 --> 53:29.371
Well...

53:32.410 --> 53:34.610
Maybe this is your big chance.

53:36.514 --> 53:37.546
Big chance?

53:37.548 --> 53:38.480
Yeah.

53:38.482 --> 53:43.786
Like, nobody wants
to be the bad guy, right?

53:43.788 --> 53:44.720
Right.

53:44.722 --> 53:50.659
Well, Isabel is dating another man,
so clearly she is the guilty party here.

53:52.863 --> 53:54.797
You can have your freedom back.

53:57.301 --> 53:59.435
I thought we
were happy together.

53:59.437 --> 54:02.271
Would any of this be
happening if you were happy?

54:07.678 --> 54:09.645
[Phone ringing]

54:45.716 --> 54:46.649
You okay?

54:49.787 --> 54:55.658
This must be what people mean when they say,
"You're living the dream."

55:22.320 --> 55:26.789
I have so much joy inside,
I feel like I'm goin' to burst.

55:26.791 --> 55:30.059
I'm actually here with you.

55:30.961 --> 55:36.465
I kept dreaming that I was waking up and
you were standing over me like an angel.

55:36.467 --> 55:37.833
How is your head today?

55:37.835 --> 55:41.370
It-- it-- it does hurt,
but I think a bit less.

55:41.839 --> 55:45.407
I can't-- I can't remember
anything about last night.

55:46.444 --> 55:47.676
How did I hurt my hand?

55:48.346 --> 55:53.082
You-- you don't remember
the rest of the evening?

55:53.084 --> 55:55.384
It goes a bit of fuzzy.

55:55.386 --> 55:57.686
After breakfast,
we should talk.

55:58.122 --> 55:59.054
Yeah.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.725
Let me get some
coffee in me first.

56:05.830 --> 56:08.397
Oh, ever since Mr. Fluffy died,

56:09.367 --> 56:13.702
things just have been
so boring around here.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.505
Having someone around is great.

56:16.507 --> 56:18.107
I'm just gonna go
upstairs and get dressed.

56:18.109 --> 56:19.508
Don't you go away, okay?

56:24.115 --> 56:25.514
I did the right thing, didn't I?

56:27.385 --> 56:29.418
Line in the sand, right?

56:32.823 --> 56:34.857
Your wife comes home
with another man home, you--

56:34.859 --> 56:36.392
You know, you can't stay there.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.528
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.530
But you did humiliate her.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.499
She was gonna retaliate.

56:43.501 --> 56:45.667
Oh no, the bet
was just a joke, man.

56:45.669 --> 56:46.869
Yeah, a humiliating joke.

56:46.871 --> 56:48.971
It didn't give
her the right to date.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.407
Yeah, it does,
I think technically speaking.

56:51.409 --> 56:53.675
I think I'm
in the right here.

57:00.184 --> 57:03.569
What do you
think they're doing now?

57:03.570 --> 57:06.955
Well, we've had our Sunday breakfast,
you're helping me with my bandage.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.993
We're just like
a married couple.

57:12.029 --> 57:12.995
Okay.

57:12.997 --> 57:17.065
Uh, there's something
I need to tell you, again.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.867
Maybe not now?

57:19.870 --> 57:24.039
- I r-- I-- I really need to leave.
- You're leaving?

57:26.177 --> 57:29.011
- Yeah.
- Oh, well. Okay.

57:39.223 --> 57:40.556
He's leavin'.

57:46.697 --> 57:48.130
[Cal] He's alone.
What does that mean?

57:48.132 --> 57:49.598
- [Max] It's great.
- [Cal] What?

57:49.600 --> 57:51.150
Yeah, yeah.

57:51.151 --> 57:52.701
She'll be comin' over
any minute, sort things out.

57:52.703 --> 57:55.804
Right.
And apologize to me, right?

57:55.806 --> 57:57.172
Wouldn't hope for too much.

58:03.214 --> 58:04.713
She's not coming yet.

58:07.685 --> 58:09.117
She's still not coming.

58:09.787 --> 58:11.086
Dude, it's been like 8 seconds.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.490
- Maybe I should go over there.
- Fuck no.

58:14.492 --> 58:16.925
If she doesn't want you,
and you go crawling over there,

58:16.927 --> 58:18.827
you're gonna feel so much
worse than you do now.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.128
That is true.

58:20.130 --> 58:24.132
And I don't know if I can handle feeling any worse than I feel right now.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.969
So maybe-- okay,
I'll take my time.

58:26.971 --> 58:29.137
Give her some time to think
about what she's done to me.

58:46.257 --> 58:48.958
It's been two hours.

58:48.959 --> 58:51.660
Marriage is a contract. She broke the rules,
he has no further obligation--

58:51.662 --> 58:53.061
Yeah, maybe
to you it's a contract.

58:53.063 --> 58:54.730
I'm going over there.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.533
That is a huge mistake.

58:57.535 --> 58:58.267
Oh.

58:58.936 --> 59:00.202
You don't understand.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.738
My wife and I,
we are happy together.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.874
Whatever's going on with that guy over there,
it's not serious.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.810
I want my marriage back.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.303
Will you marry me?

59:37.341 --> 59:38.574
No!

59:39.944 --> 59:43.845
No, no, no, no, no!

59:44.715 --> 59:47.249
No.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.784
If you could just wait, please um,
Isabel and I are in the middle of something.

59:49.787 --> 59:52.354
I will not wait while
another man proposes to my wife!

59:52.356 --> 59:54.974
Uh, I can explain.

59:54.975 --> 59:57.593
You keep saying that and your explanations
don't seem to make any sense.

59:57.595 --> 01:00:01.597
He thinks I'm single.
He doesn't remember meeting you last night.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.601
Oh, no, no, I do r-- I remember that part.
I know he's your husband.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:09.004
I j-- I just couldn't remember how I got here or how I hurt my hand or--

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:11.306
or you know, whether
we played charades or anything.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.042
You-- you know, I'm married.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.845
He's just your first husband.

01:00:17.348 --> 01:00:19.114
Or m-- maybe second.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.151
Have there-- have
there been any others?

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.853
Oh, no, no,
no, just the one.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.254
I can't believe this.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:30.792
So maybe I should
make my intentions clearer.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.764
After you've divorced
him, will you marry me?

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.301
Well, congratulations.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.704
I have to give it to you,
babe, you pulled it off.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.773
You won the bet.

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:49.945
You promised you
wouldn't say anything.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.647
What-- what bet?

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.249
Oh, he needs to know.

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:56.318
Please.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.389
My wife and I had a little argument in that restaurant that Saturday night

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:03.392
and she bet me that she could get the
next guy who came through the door

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:04.726
to propose to her.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:13.686
You mean a--

01:01:13.687 --> 01:01:14.670
You mean after
I'd walked through.

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:16.004
You mean a--

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.974
You mean after she'd seen me.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:21.276
No.

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:25.881
This was in the golden age
before we even knew you existed.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:32.754
So could've been anyone, buddy.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.890
God, Cal.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:48.704
Is that true?

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.740
Yes.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.492
- [Max] It was Thursday.
- [Jennifer] It was Wednesday.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:47.062
- I'm sure it was Thursday.
- I just cannot take much more of this, okay?

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.197
You always say important
things happen on Thursday.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:50.398
Nothing happens on Thursdays.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.768
I'm just statin'
a fact, it was Thursday!

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.236
Could you let
me finish, please?

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:59.975
Cal, tell him that the days
of the week are important.

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:01.910
Leave him alone.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:02.844
Cal.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:04.946
Cal?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:05.881
Cal?

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.786
He agrees.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:53.829
Stop!

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:06.508
I'm sorry.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.109
I'm really sorry.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:10.245
I know I behaved
like a total ass.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:13.949
And I can tell
you why I did it.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.755
- It's because my team lost.
- What?

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:22.591
I was reading about the game on my phone in the restaurant,
it was a really big loss,

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:26.061
and they were supposed to win,
and I-- I just took it out on you like a total jerk.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:29.431
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have said a few things or done few things,

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:32.234
but I uh-- don't need
to talk about that,

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:34.002
because I am the one
who started it,

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:39.908
and I am the one who kept
makin' it happen, so...

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:44.279
You know, I honestly thought
I was being funny, but I wasn't.

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:47.649
I was being cruel.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:50.117
So yeah, I have
not been behaving well.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:54.890
But that does not mean
I don't love you.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.094
You already knew I wasn't
you know, Prince Charming.

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:03.899
But uh, I've loved you
since the first time we ever--

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:09.471
Actually,
it was-- let me think.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.308
Four, five weeks
after we first met.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:17.112
You were sitting in the corner,
and I was talking to someone else,

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:21.016
and I was watching you, thinking,
I always like talking to her.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:21.983
Isabel.

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:28.523
"I mean she's really pretty,
but it's not just that. I enjoy her company."

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.659
I liked you, because
you didn't play games.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:34.362
You didn't flirt, and then act
hard to get, and all that crap.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:39.284
You were just you.

01:05:39.285 --> 01:05:42.303
Then I end up giving you a hard time for
being the exactly the woman I fell in love with.

01:05:43.674 --> 01:05:47.275
I would really
like another chance.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:52.247
I mean, come on,
if women ended their marriages

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:56.017
just because men were a bit of an asshole sometimes,
there wouldn't be any marriage, right?

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:58.119
But I will--

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:04.993
I will try to be
less of an asshole.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.028
Hand on my heart.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.200
And I know I am lucky to be
the man that you said "yes" to

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:14.502
on that hill
with the sun going down.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:18.640
And I will never let
myself forget that again.

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:21.676
So...

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:25.447
...what do you say?

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:34.389
Would you like to come over
for dinner tonight? Maybe 06:00?

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:35.323
At 6:00?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.292
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:32.280
It was only dislocated,
but try not to use it until the pain subsides.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:33.415
Could be a few weeks.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:38.219
And you have to reduce
your stress, Mr. Mace.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.358
Here are your prescriptions.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.692
Be sure to take them
as scheduled.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:51.099
So your-- your next appointment is on the 8th,
it's on this card.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.268
Do you understand me, Mr. Mace?

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:58.106
I'm not stupid.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.189
See you tomorrow.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.723
It's 4:30.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.625
I thought I'd get
an early start on the evening.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.395
You're-- you're
usually the last one to leave.

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:21.429
And you seem...

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.598
...happy.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.799
What do you mean?

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:26.835
You've been miserable.

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:28.536
Oh, have I?

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.473
Well, let's see how
I am tomorrow, shall we?

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.108
- [Phone ringing]
- Oh, excuse me.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:35.609
Oh.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.212
Hello.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:50.325
[Albert]
Yes, I'm nearly done! Jesus!

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.693
Oh.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.729
I told you I would leave
the keys on the counter,

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.899
you didn't
need to come in person.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:59.600
Oh, no, no, no.
Go away. Go--

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:01.402
- Albert, please. I--
- What?

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:05.773
What do you want?
You'd-- hmm?

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.277
Which-- I don't know what
part this is of your sick bet.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:12.147
What do you actually-- actually you
have to pry the ring out of my fingers?

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:13.881
You and your husband
have laughed at me enough.

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:16.818
I'm here because that doctor
from the hospital called.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.404
What?

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.389
I-- I gave my number
as your contact person,

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:26.528
you weren't in any fit state to fill out the forms,
so I-- I didn't know who else to put.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:29.697
Oh, I suppose he's
told you everything.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.466
No, there's confidentiality.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:35.370
He-- he just asked me if I was
still in touch with you.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:36.571
He seemed worried.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.305
Yeah, well, you
can see what's happened.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:40.942
I have dislocated my shoulder.
And I'm moving out.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.510
People move out
with a bad shoulder.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.612
So you can go
back to your husband.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.214
- Why are you moving?
- 'Cause...

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.716
'Cause I lost my job
and I can't pay the rent.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.504
Oh.

01:09:52.505 --> 01:09:55.290
And I've spent all my savings on care for my mom and-- and then--

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.224
The ring.

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:58.793
You know, I shouldn't
have had it engraved.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.330
Where are you going?

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:04.899
I don't care where I'm going.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:06.668
Hey, hey.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.208
Come on.

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:19.948
Come on.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.396
Yeah.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.971
- [Jennifer] Oh, hey!
- Hi.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:45.273
Max is working late tonight,
I thought we'd get some Chinese food in.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.609
- What do you like?
- Oh, I'm going out tonight.

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:48.843
Oh, you are?

01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:52.380
- I have a date.
- You have a date?

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:54.566
Yeah.

01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:56.751
Oh, if you're ever looking for someone to have dinner with,
I'm free.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.453
Anytime.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:02.690
Who is she?

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.325
Isabel.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:09.897
You're getting back together?

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:11.599
Well, I'm hoping so.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:17.405
My first date with Isabel was incredible and
I'm hoping this one would be even better.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.474
Me, too.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.744
- Here we go, uh.
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.279
- Let's get this on.
- Okay.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.514
Alright. Alrighty.

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.350
Oh, what a suit!

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.986
- Okay?
- Yep.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:33.688
Oh.

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:35.290
How do I look?

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:38.793
- Stunning.
- Thank you.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:40.628
Go get her.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.866
Yeah.

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.443
Doesn't look like you're
getting back together.

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:57.045
Unless that first
date was a threesome.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.449
I had a threesome
once in a hot tub.

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:04.752
Three's a funny
number, you know?

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:08.723
It's hard to know
where your turn is.

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.592
[Cal] Do you think she
did that on purpose?

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:15.930
Got him to move in tonight,
after inviting me over to dinner just to get back at me?

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:17.965
I don't know, hon.

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:20.802
But I warned you.

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:24.339
[Phone chiming]

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.381
"We'll have
to make it another night."

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.483
Man, that is cold.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:41.556
So what should I do?

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:48.429
Well, an evening alone
with me is not so bad, is it?

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.470
I'll get the booze.

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:15.490
Got you an extra blanket,
some towels, and a toothbrush.

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:23.398
- Anything else you need?
- No.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:27.735
I suppose I
should say "thank you".

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.439
No, this is my fault, so uh...

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:36.778
- No.
- I won't be staying long, so you don't need to worry.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:39.480
Well, if it helps
for a few nights.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:41.549
Whatever I can do.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.818
And your husband,
I didn't see him.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.954
Do I have to worry that he'll burst in the door in the middle of the night

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.923
and shout rude things at me?

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:51.626
That's not gonna happen.

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:10.178
Oh!

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:18.719
Yeah.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.824
God.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.460
Still nothin'.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:31.132
I feel like my life is ending.

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:35.703
Well...

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:39.607
Maybe--

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:43.478
It's just beginning.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:45.646
Hmm?

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.090
Jennifer, no.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.093
I think that's Max.

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:01.095
Oh, I don't care,
let him find us.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.930
No, no. Oh God,
I should never get drunk.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:05.132
Nothing good comes out of getting drunk after you're 30.

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:09.971
Oh, no. It's okay.
No, no. This is so right!

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:13.841
Jennifer, no!
What if Isabel finds out?

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:17.245
- Max is my friend.
- It doesn't matter. He won't care!

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:18.646
- Please.
- I don't care.

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:19.947
Don't tell him
anything happened.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.858
So my asshole boss, right,
he says, "Redo the spreadsheet."

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.894
I redo the spreadsheet.
He says, "Redo it again."

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:34.795
I said, "It's
9 o' fucking clock."

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.731
He said, "Is that all?"

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.269
Beer, yes!

01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:42.837
Hope you saved some for me.

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.273
Is there anything to eat?
I'm starving.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:47.942
There's some
Chinese in the kitchen.

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:54.282
Uh, Jennifer's
not feeling well.

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:55.783
That woman's
never feeling well.

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:02.557
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.058
I'll get out of--
I'll get out of your way.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.677
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:16:05.678 --> 01:16:07.295
- I was just making coffee.
- Oh no, make yourself at home.

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:09.130
- No, I didn't-- I didn't--
- Well, I can do that.

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.965
I didn't want you
to wait on me. I'm--

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:13.000
I-- I should
probably leave for work.

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:16.003
- So there's a spare key in the drawer.
- Oh yeah, thank you.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.705
Uh-- I'll pro--

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:19.907
I'll probably be
out um, job hunting.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.343
Would you-- no rush
with your shoulder.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.645
No, uh-- uh, so I
can get out of your hair.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:30.117
- I'll be bringing dinner in, so you don't have to--
- No, you-- you don't--

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:33.220
It's-- really you
don't need to. I'm fine.

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:35.256
Fine, fine.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:37.058
Alright.

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:12.660
- I really can't let you--
- Oh please, sit down.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.863
We can't eat in shifts,
it would be absurd.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:29.210
Just to say
since I am staying here,

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:33.681
I am experiencing difficulties
in my job search

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:37.051
due to my former employer
giving me a bad reference.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:42.089
I had hoped to find
something immediately.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:45.259
That's okay.

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:46.927
No, it's not.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.740
So then I said,
"That's not the way to do it."

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:01.876
And he says, "Well,
that's how I want it done."

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:07.815
I mean I'm no fool,
I know what I'm doin'.

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:11.185
Deserve some respect, right?

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:20.861
[Isabel] Oh.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.332
Oh.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:27.702
Good night.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.259
Oh you-- you
don't have to do that.

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:54.061
Oh, it was no problem.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.363
With one arm, it probably was.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:03.771
I was gonna watch an old movie.
Do you wanna...

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.073
Oh, I don't think so.

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:08.909
You sure?

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.044
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:58.959
Oh, I-- I thought I might
make my um, lasagna tonight.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.063
- Would that be okay?
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:07.168
No, I-- I mean I--
I'd like to.

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:09.570
That would be nice. Thanks.

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:12.072
Well, wait till you've tasted
it, you might change your mind.

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:13.908
Bye.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:14.842
Bye.

01:20:16.546 --> 01:20:18.078
Oh God.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:25.186
I hate to say this, bro,
it's just not looking good for you right now.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.255
Yeah, maybe I should
get myself an apartment.

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:33.127
But that would make it real.
I'm not sure I'm ready for it to be real yet.

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.195
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:37.431
Hey, listen you're more than welcome to stay here as long as you want.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:39.066
And Jennifer loves the company.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:40.835
Haven't see her
this happy in ages.

01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:44.205
Hmm, thanks, man.

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:50.578
So you just have the one son.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.179
Yeah, Colin.

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:55.182
He always wanted to travel
and now he's doing it.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:58.185
It's hard, though, I miss him.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:20:59.987
But you've got
to let them grow up.

01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:04.225
My mother never
wanted me to travel.

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:08.295
She was heartbroken
when I came here.

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:09.496
But she had a cat.

01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:11.966
Billy Bob.

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:15.269
I think she saw
Billy Bob as my brother.

01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:18.505
In fact, I'm pretty
sure he was her favorite.

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:26.046
Poor old sweet Billy Bob was
the stupidest cat you ever saw.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.150
We used to live near these ducks and, you know,
I was always afraid he would attack them.

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:33.520
So I used to pick him up
every time we walked past.

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:38.626
But I think he thought I was protecting
him rather than the other way around.

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:43.030
And then from then onward whenever we went past the ducks,
he used to leap into my arms.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:45.116
Aw!

01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:47.201
You were such a great
big brother to Billy Bob.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.972
My mom and dad had a cat,
when they first got married.

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:55.075
And there is a picture
of the two them holding it.

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:57.344
The cat's name was Isabel.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:59.947
It's not like they
named me after a cat,

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:03.951
it's just they liked the name "Isabel",
so they used it for their baby as well.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:07.254
But they always used to say,
"This is us with Isabel."

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:10.257
So I thought it was
a picture of me.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:15.229
But I was a cat before
I grew into a little girl.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.998
And um, I was
in the playground one day,

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:21.535
telling all the other kids
that I used to be a cat,

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:24.705
and asking them
what animal they used to be.

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:29.343
And my mom had to break the news
to me that I was never a cat.

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:31.178
Yep.

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:34.481
Think I'm still
getting over the disappointment.

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:37.952
That is a nice story.

01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:41.956
You know, I never
told anyone before.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.394
I'd love to meet Billy Bob.

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:49.496
You look like him?

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:51.699
Yeah, we were twins.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:17.758
Well, thank you again.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.660
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.061
Jack's a friend.

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:22.463
He-- he's a nice guy.

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:25.366
And he knows I've
got a bad reference?

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:29.069
Yeah, I told him everything.
Well, not-- not everything.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:33.640
But uh, about your mom,
just to explain why you were angry that day,

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:38.245
and that you-- more-- you're more interested
in product management than sales anyway.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:40.681
He said he's happy
to interview you.

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:42.282
Well...

01:23:43.786 --> 01:23:45.753
...wish me luck tomorrow.

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:48.689
You don't need it.

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:51.525
Oh, we all need some luck.

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:54.762
Okay, that's true.

01:23:57.767 --> 01:23:59.566
Better get to bed.
I mean you know, it's um--

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:01.468
It's late.

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:03.237
Yeah.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:06.507
Good night.

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:08.242
Good night.

01:24:47.817 --> 01:24:49.349
Oh...

01:25:01.831 --> 01:25:03.330
Oh, I should go to bed.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:07.734
Just going up the stairs
seems like too much effort.

01:25:08.838 --> 01:25:10.671
I shouldn't have had
that third glass of wine.

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.473
Well, we are celebrating.

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.741
Yes, we are.

01:25:16.412 --> 01:25:18.612
Tomorrow, I have
to get out my best suit.

01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:21.615
- Clean my shoes.
- Hmm.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.618
I never
believed I'd get that job.

01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:31.592
I thought there was
only bad news ahead for me.

01:25:34.864 --> 01:25:35.762
I used--

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:40.334
I mean I've--
I've never made it.

01:25:44.206 --> 01:25:45.139
But--

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:52.446
But before my mother was sick
and when I had my old job...

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.352
I think I was a different man.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.459
I wish you'd known me then.

01:26:41.664 --> 01:26:44.464
[Jennifer] You have no idea what has been going on behind your back.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:48.702
Do you?
You have no idea that we were making out right on that couch

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:50.704
the night that you
came home late from work.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:53.607
You walked right in,
you didn't even notice!

01:26:55.578 --> 01:26:56.510
What?

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:58.445
Tell him, honey.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.314
Tell him.

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:03.784
Hey!

01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:05.886
Is that true?

01:27:09.491 --> 01:27:10.424
What's up?

01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:49.930
[Door opening]

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:11.285
I'm back home.

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:34.741
Good night.

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:35.676
Good night.

01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:31.631
[Doorbell ringing]

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.515
I don't want Max to see me.

01:29:48.517 --> 01:29:49.983
God knows what he'd do to us.

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:52.052
- Oh God, Jennifer.
- Oh!

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:54.154
[Jennifer] I just hate
living there without you.

01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:56.923
Please, come back.
I love you.

01:29:56.925 --> 01:29:58.625
I love you.

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:01.395
This is not what it looks like.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:03.530
Yes, it is.

01:30:04.867 --> 01:30:06.400
[Pounding on door]

01:30:06.402 --> 01:30:07.968
[Jennifer] Oh shit!

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:11.104
I guess I should open that.

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:18.779
You were my best friend.

01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:22.682
- Come on, I'm not really your best friend, but--
- My best friend!

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:24.117
What's going on?

01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:28.622
Did he tell you
why I kicked him out? Huh?

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:31.958
The two of them were
makin' out in my own home!

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.194
I thought we could fix things,

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:36.429
but now she's sneakin' off to his bed in the middle of the night!

01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:40.634
Nothing ever happened between me and Jennifer,
nothing is happening.

01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:42.636
Honey, you don't have to lie.

01:30:42.638 --> 01:30:45.439
If you didn't want me,
then you wouldn't have stayed!

01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:46.440
Because--

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:51.878
Oh my God, that kiss was
the greatest kiss of my life.

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:53.980
That's not accurate.

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:55.849
Isabel.

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:56.783
Get out.

01:30:57.219 --> 01:30:58.785
No, but--

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:00.086
Get out!

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:02.155
Isabel.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:04.925
You really don't want me?

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:11.031
Oh fuck!

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.488
Please, don't
stand there and gloat.

01:31:37.226 --> 01:31:40.627
I was drunk. She kissed me.
I pushed her away.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:46.500
Yeah, I know, you don't believe me.
No one believes me.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:50.120
Hell, what does it matter?

01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:53.239
Once I made that idiot bet,
Isabel was never gonna forgive me.

01:31:56.245 --> 01:31:57.577
I'm sorry about that.

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:03.617
Yeah.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.955
In the end, you won the bet.

01:32:11.827 --> 01:32:12.993
You won my wife.

01:32:22.638 --> 01:32:25.071
Well, it's just us again.

01:32:28.076 --> 01:32:29.976
Actually, now
I have gotten my job,

01:32:31.914 --> 01:32:35.015
I'll be able
to find another place.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:37.717
Oh.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.288
Well, there's--
there's no hurry.

01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:42.789
No, well, I n--

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.162
I never wanted you or-- or anyone else to feel obligated to me.

01:32:49.164 --> 01:32:50.096
I know, but--

01:32:52.034 --> 01:32:53.567
Friends help friends.

01:32:56.672 --> 01:32:57.804
I suppose um--

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.207
I don't want to be
late for my first day.

01:33:01.209 --> 01:33:02.142
Hmm.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.815
Why don't you and I-- I
don't know how to say this.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:10.083
Why don't you and I...

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.820
...go out
together this evening?

01:33:15.157 --> 01:33:17.257
I have an apartment
to see at 06:00

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:21.161
and then we could maybe meet at
07:00 at the restaurant where we met?

01:33:34.009 --> 01:33:35.275
See ya.

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:12.045
Mr. Mace, hello again.

01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:19.152
It's um, my first day
on a new job today,

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:22.922
so if we could just
get this over with quickly, I--

01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:25.025
Uh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:27.394
I-- I have your test results.

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:32.832
I'm afraid your-- your heart

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:37.037
is not
the heart of a teenager.

01:34:37.039 --> 01:34:40.674
But if you manage to keep
your stress levels down,

01:34:40.676 --> 01:34:43.309
watch your diet,
and take your medications,

01:34:43.311 --> 01:34:46.079
which I understand you only
started a few days ago,

01:34:46.081 --> 01:34:49.716
then you should have many adventures ahead of you in life.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.232
Thank you.

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:08.685
You're very welcome.

01:35:08.686 --> 01:35:10.436
You know, I-- I-- I
hope I never see you again.

01:36:13.235 --> 01:36:14.501
Hi.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.203
Hi.

01:36:33.922 --> 01:36:35.155
[Cal] Oh.

01:36:40.862 --> 01:36:42.829
Albert suggested we do this.
