a new identity,

04:29.730 --> 04:31.527
a new home, new life.

about the people

05:19.950 --> 05:21.975
who helped the worst

How convenient for him.

YeS, he getS
what he wants,
but in exchange,

05:32.160 --> 05:34.993
we get to ID criminals
Orion has hidden
in plain Sight.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.225
And arrest a company
of murderers.

05:37.270 --> 05:40.797
Orion doesn't just give
their Clients fake IDS.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.296
They kill innocent people

05:42.340 --> 05:44.228
and give
their identities
to their clients.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.431
So if Reddington
already knows Orion's name,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.107
why can't he find them
himself?

05:48.140 --> 05:51.849
"Orion" is a DBA,
a financial Shell
he can't crack.

Oh, my.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.122

10:34.160 --> 10:37.891
I bartered a long weekend
at my pied-a-terre

10:37.930 --> 10:40.239

10:40.270 --> 10:43.569
This chef, Rasmus Ray,

10:43.610 --> 10:46.499
iS something of an outlier
in food circleS.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.770
No restaurant, no menu.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.677
Plenty of
youthful
innovation.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.747
Apparently he only
hosts these dinners

10:54.780 --> 10:56.611

10:56.650 --> 10:58.288
which bodes well
for our evening.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.289

in finding Burke's fence.

that's our fence.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.846
Mr. PotaSh.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.906

Not yet, but we're
about to make each other

With predisposed
expectations

12:10.230 --> 12:12.585

And texture.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.590

the greatest nutrients.

of vegetables,

12:19.700 --> 12:21.668

12:27.580 --> 12:30.208

discolored meat.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.912
When you avoid something
on your plate,

12:32.950 --> 12:37.216
chances are you're avoiding it
because of a past experience.

to pick up.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.591
Why would you
be calling him?

33:56.630 --> 33:59.793
He insisted I give him
Denise's location
aS soon as we got one.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.594
So he could get there first.
Now, did you give it to him

34:02.640 --> 34:04.164
before or after
you gave it to us?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.201
