00:04.395 --> 00:06.441
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:06.484 --> 00:07.355
- You should know
that I have always

00:07.398 --> 00:08.530
found you to be insufferable.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.619
- And I've seen
80-year-old stroke victims

00:10.662 --> 00:13.317
improve their range of motion
faster than you.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.667
- The board's calling a vote
to terminate Fulton's contract.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.495
- It's done.
I'm out.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.889
- Max. There was a brain bleed.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.587
Georgia's in surgery
with Hartman.

00:55.142 --> 00:58.884
- Let's keep dreaming.

00:58.928 --> 01:02.149
- I'd love to.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.238
- You could call in sick.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.241
We could stay in bed all day.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.678
- I remember those days.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.680
- We were so bad.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.294
- It was so good.

01:17.338 --> 01:21.124
- I thought we'd have
more of those days.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.171
I thought we'd have
so much time.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.086
- I would've done
everything different.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.481
If I knew.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.961
- Start now.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.963
Stay here with me.

01:45.148 --> 01:48.412
- I gotta go to work.

01:48.456 --> 01:49.631
- Maybe I'll come with you.

01:52.721 --> 01:55.115
It gets so lonely.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.508
- ♪ All your love is

01:57.552 --> 02:01.817
♪ All your love is blind

02:01.860 --> 02:05.603
♪ I'll sleep until
the day you're mine ♪

02:08.040 --> 02:09.477
- Excuse me.
Helen, hey.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.741
I happened to get you
a cappuccino dry.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.395
- Thanks. Another $3
knocked off your debt.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.961
- How much do I have left?

02:16.005 --> 02:18.529
- For the insanely expensive
non-refundable cleaning service

02:18.573 --> 02:20.792
that I graciously sent
to your home and you rejected?

02:20.836 --> 02:23.665
- That's the one.
- About 112 cappuccinos more.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.971
- Well, what if I make it
a double or a triple?

02:26.015 --> 02:27.147
I'm sorry, okay.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.192
It was such
a thoughtful gesture.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.193
- Yes, it was.
- I appreciate it.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.455
I'm very sorry,

02:31.499 --> 02:32.848
and will you please
accept my apology?

02:32.891 --> 02:34.371
- Oh, God.

02:34.415 --> 02:35.459
Accepted.
- Good.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.808
- Are you ever gonna tell me

02:36.852 --> 02:40.856
why you threw my wildly
generous gift to the curb?

02:40.899 --> 02:42.292
- Oh, uh...

02:42.336 --> 02:46.296
I just don't want strangers
in my house right now.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.124
- ♪ All your love is

02:48.168 --> 02:51.171
♪ All your love is blind

02:53.085 --> 02:54.043
- She's tachy.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.523
70/30, 130.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.177
- Ms. Trombley,
we've been expecting you.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.308
- I'm scared, Mama.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.180
- I know.
It's okay, baby.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.617
- Septal Q waves
in the lateral leads.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.794
- On my count.
One, two, three.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.362
- Kayla, I'm Dr. Reynolds.
I'm gonna take care of you.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.717
We gotta get her
into surgery.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.154
- But now?
What kind of surgery?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.938
- Mrs. Trombley,
Kayla's got an overgrowth

03:19.982 --> 03:21.462
of muscle tissue in her heart,

03:21.505 --> 03:23.507
and we need to fix this now,
or her heart could stop again.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.595
- It's often genetic,

03:24.639 --> 03:25.988
so we should
get you checked, too.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.817
- If you need to contact
anyone, family, her father--

03:28.860 --> 03:30.427
- No, he's passed on.

03:30.471 --> 03:33.038
- Okay, she's all set.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.257
- She's all I have.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.390
- We've got her.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.829
- She's in good hands.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.832
- That's my baby.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.531
- Stay strong, okay?
You need to stay strong.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.533
- It has been my honor
to assist you

03:49.577 --> 03:52.232
in managing
your physical issues, Nathan.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.277
But for your emotional needs,

03:54.321 --> 03:56.018
I can think of no one better
than Dr. Iggy Frome.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.280
- Hi, there.
How you doing?

03:57.324 --> 03:58.238
You must be Nate.
- Sir.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.022
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.197
So Dr. Kapoor tells me

04:01.241 --> 04:04.548
you would like to join
our merry band.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.942
- Well, he thinks
it might be a good idea.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.814
- Nathan has done
two tours in Afghanistan.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.555
I believe your PTSD
support group

04:11.599 --> 04:13.557
can be the perfect
medicine for him now.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.994
- I agree.
So when did you get back?

04:16.038 --> 04:17.518
- A year ago July.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.259
- You know, a lot of our folks
were in Afghanistan.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.608
Iraq, as well.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.610
We have a colonel in there
who began his service

04:22.653 --> 04:23.828
in the first Gulf War.

04:23.872 --> 04:24.916
We have a captain
from the second--

04:24.960 --> 04:27.528
- Sir,
I'm not really clear why...

04:27.571 --> 04:29.486
I mean, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here, but--

04:29.530 --> 04:30.922
- You're not alone here,
Nathan.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.621
- No, not by a long shot.
We're all about support.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.579
It's just a safe space
for you to share your truth

04:35.623 --> 04:37.146
with folks who lead with love.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.756
- You call yourself a Marine?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.367
Everything,
everything you're saying,

04:40.410 --> 04:41.498
complete betrayal
of leadership.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.674
- My leadership betrayed me.

04:43.718 --> 04:46.198
All I ever wanted was to be
a Marine like my dad.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.809
I was a true believer,

04:47.852 --> 04:50.115
but we were betrayed in Iraq,
sir!

04:50.159 --> 04:51.334
The purpose of our mission--

04:51.378 --> 04:53.684
- It wasn't your job
to question the purpose.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.208
It was your job
to accomplish the mission.

04:56.252 --> 04:59.429
The only reason, only reason
I came to this crap show

04:59.473 --> 05:00.952
is 'cause my wife insisted,

05:00.996 --> 05:03.607
but I don't have to stand here
and listen to this

05:03.651 --> 05:05.174
sad sack
Monday morning quarterback.

05:05.217 --> 05:08.308
- Okay, Quinn,
take a breath.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.788
Take a deep one.
Okay?

05:10.832 --> 05:12.137
We've talked about this,
haven't we?

05:12.181 --> 05:13.443
- Yeah.
- Yes.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.358
Amalia has a different
experience than you.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.968
That's it.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.143
But you two fought
for the same country.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.971
That is what binds you.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.192
That is such a load of crap.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.065
- Is it?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.507
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.074
- Oh.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.946
You don't know our experience.
You don't know.

05:48.304 --> 05:53.353
You don't know the pain
of losing a part of you...

05:53.396 --> 05:57.008
while so many
of your friends never...

06:06.496 --> 06:08.585
No, there's no words.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.596
- Actually, there are.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.732
And to give us those words...

06:24.775 --> 06:27.256
we are gonna try something new,

06:27.299 --> 06:31.391
and yet something
that is thousands of years old.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.091
We're gonna put on a play.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.098
- Elizabeth, sorry to keep you.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.709
- No problem.
I was just running laps.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.407
- Meet Dr. Juan Questa.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.321
Juan, meet Elizabeth Archer,

06:49.365 --> 06:51.585
my long-time patient
and office Olympian.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.631
- Hello, Elizabeth.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.547
- Never a great sign
when a new doctor shows up.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.722
- Today is an exception.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.681
Juan isn't an oncologist.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.465
He's an orthopedic surgeon.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.988
- The back pain
you're experiencing

07:04.032 --> 07:06.251
is from where your osteosarcoma
was removed.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.427
- But this isn't a recurrence.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.732
We've examined your PET scan,

07:08.776 --> 07:10.168
and you are cancer-free.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.566
Wow.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.960
That's great.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.875
So...

07:20.918 --> 07:22.616
why two doctors?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.925
- Now when the tumor
was taken out,

07:27.969 --> 07:30.754
a metal plate
was installed for stability.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.408
Unfortunately, it's moved.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.931
That's what's causing
your discomfort.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.717
- Fixing it
will require another surgery.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.503
But you are in great hands
with Dr. Questa.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.989
- Is this my fault?

07:48.032 --> 07:49.773
- Not at all.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.601
- Did I move in some way
that I shouldn't have?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.124
I do a lot of stretching.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.952
- No, it's been 10 years.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.955
Over time, the body shifts,
and hardware can shift with it.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.959
- But if I'd gone
to the doctor sooner,

08:02.003 --> 08:03.831
I might never have needed
the plate at all,

08:03.874 --> 08:06.311
and maybe the tumor
wouldn't have grown so big.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.052
- Liz...

08:08.096 --> 08:12.056
nothing that's happened
is your fault.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.536
We've talked about this.

08:16.757 --> 08:19.760
- And why ask why,
and, man, it's hard to stop.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.767
Okay.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.120
Let's do some surgery.

08:34.035 --> 08:38.039
- Ordering six units
of FFP to augment hemostasis.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.693
- Plate removed.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.956
- Diagrammatic
exclusion normal.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.175
- Where is the scar tissue?

08:44.219 --> 08:45.525
- Excuse me?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.352
- Look.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.531
- Trish, number four should be
right on the tray.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.883
- Page Max.

08:55.926 --> 08:58.538
- This is the site
of her previous surgery.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.365
- Not a lot of damage.
- Exactly.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.890
If a sizeable tumor had been
removed from this area,

09:02.933 --> 09:05.109
a large chunk of spinal cord
would've been taken with it.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.459
You'd see a ton
of irregular scar tissue.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.939
Instead,
there's just one clean cut.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.813
- Cancer didn't put her
in a wheelchair, Max.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.250
It looks like her surgeon did.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.864
- She must've had
multiple scans since then.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.605
Surely, someone would've seen--
- No, not with the plate.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.694
The plate made it impossible
to give her an MRI

09:24.738 --> 09:26.566
and created too much
artifact on a CT scan

09:26.609 --> 09:27.697
to see the area clearly.

09:27.741 --> 09:28.872
- But there was
a structural reason

09:28.916 --> 09:30.787
for the plate
to be there, right?

09:33.747 --> 09:36.706
- None that I can see.

09:36.750 --> 09:40.188
- So we did this.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.278
A New Amsterdam doctor
cut her spinal cord.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.542
- And put a plate
inside her to cover it up.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.989
- She did have cancer.
That was real.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.121
- Yeah, but that's not
what put her in the chair.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.557
We did,
and she deserves to know that.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.645
- She will.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.386
We are absolutely
gonna tell her.

10:04.429 --> 10:05.387
- Now.
- Max,

10:05.430 --> 10:06.606
we need to see the op report.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.216
We need to speak
with the original surgeon.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.348
- There's no reason that
we can't tell her right now.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.523
- We don't have all the facts.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.655
And if we're wrong
about any of this,

10:12.699 --> 10:15.832
if we give her
more misinformation...

10:15.876 --> 10:16.877
let's take the day.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.226
24 hours to get at the truth,

10:18.269 --> 10:21.185
and then we will talk
to her together.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.669
- All right.

10:26.713 --> 10:31.065
Septal wall muscular overgrowth
isolated and resected.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.589
Ready for pathological
confirmation.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.809
Heart should be repaired now,
Dr. Duke.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.114
It's closing time.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.072
- 5-0 Prolene on a stick?

10:38.115 --> 10:39.290
- That's right.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.989
- Got an IV
of normal saline going.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.208
- Floyd,
this is not cardiomyopathy.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.297
- But Makayla's heart
was hypertrophied.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.430
- Absolutely,
and you were right to operate,

10:48.473 --> 10:50.693
but it's because
of an infiltration

10:50.737 --> 10:53.348
of abnormal blood cells.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.611
I'm afraid this girl
has leukemia.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.794
- Leukemia.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.363
- Fortunately,
we caught it early.

11:08.406 --> 11:11.453
But she will need
a bone marrow transplant.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.847
- And I can't help her?

11:13.890 --> 11:16.153
- Well,
your blood type isn't a match.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.633
AB positive is pretty rare.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.462
I did put Makayla
on the marrow donor registry,

11:20.505 --> 11:21.985
but I gotta be honest with you.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.508
It could take months.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.470
- So you need a blood relative?

11:28.513 --> 11:30.777
- If we can find someone
that is a match,

11:30.820 --> 11:32.996
the odds will be
much stronger than waiting.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.754
- You know, I've never been
the type of woman

11:51.798 --> 11:54.931
to beg a man
to be in his child's life.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.329
Makayla's father is alive.

12:03.287 --> 12:08.205
She doesn't know,
and I don't want her to.

12:08.249 --> 12:12.427
If you need me to call him...

12:12.470 --> 12:13.733
I'll find the strength.

12:16.823 --> 12:17.737
- Or I can do it.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.653
I mean, yeah,
if it...

12:21.697 --> 12:22.654
if it helps.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.531
-  Okay.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.055
- This is a play by Sophocles.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.840
- Phillock...tatas?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.146
- No. Close.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.539
"Philoctetes."

12:37.582 --> 12:39.280
It was written
during the Peloponnesian War,

12:39.323 --> 12:41.673
and it focuses heavily
on themes of disability,

12:41.717 --> 12:43.719
loyalty, and forgiveness
all within the military.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.808
It is considered
an ethical tragedy.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.897
It was aimed to incite
a certain sense of duty

12:47.941 --> 12:50.073
within the Greeks
during a time of war.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.858
- Is it in English?

12:51.901 --> 12:53.990
- As a matter of fact,
we are using one of my favorite

12:54.034 --> 12:55.905
translations of all time.

12:55.949 --> 12:59.039
Mine. Hold your applause.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.346
Amalia, you will be playing
the role of Neoptolemus.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.521
- Neo...what?

13:03.565 --> 13:04.435
- That's good.
I like that.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.741
We'll shorten it to Neo.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.874
Neo was a once-dutiful soldier

13:07.917 --> 13:10.050
who has a disagreement
with a ranking officer

13:10.093 --> 13:13.662
and decides to finally
stand up and say something.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.316
Colonel,
you will be playing Odysseus,

13:15.359 --> 13:16.752
our commander.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.842
But for ease of use,
why don't we call you Otis?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.627
Otis wants to march
his warriors onto victory,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.760
but he is confronted
with the fallout of a choice

13:24.804 --> 13:26.762
he's made to abandon
one of his best soldiers

13:26.806 --> 13:28.285
after he's been badly injured.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.157
- Never abandoned anyone.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.201
- I didn't say you did.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.464
Now, finally...

13:33.508 --> 13:35.553
Nathan, you will be playing
our title role

13:35.597 --> 13:38.034
of Philoctetes.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.732
Okay, and your character,
after being badly injured,

13:40.776 --> 13:44.606
is ejected from the military
and left on an island alone.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.304
The rest of you
will be my Greek chorus.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.089
- Hey!

13:49.132 --> 13:50.699
- I can't sing.

13:50.742 --> 13:54.007
- Oh, I highly doubt that,
but you won't have to.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.312
- How is this therapy?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.574
- That's a good question.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.794
As Nathan wisely stated,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.798
he does not have the words
to communicate how you feel.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.803
This play can give them to you.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.502
Okay?
One last thing.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.808
Curtain goes up at four.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.941
- Wait, we're doing this
in front of people?

14:14.984 --> 14:16.856
- Yes.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.292
- At the tone,
please record your message.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.469
- Mr. Bell,
this is Dr. Reynolds

14:21.512 --> 14:23.514
from New Amsterdam Hospital.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.386
I'm sorry to report
that your daughter

14:25.429 --> 14:27.823
has been diagnosed
with leukemia.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.912
Now she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

14:29.956 --> 14:33.742
and we are calling relatives
to see if we can find a match.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.136
I know that you are estranged
from your daughter

14:36.179 --> 14:37.354
and have been for a while,

14:37.398 --> 14:39.356
but...

14:39.400 --> 14:41.576
she needs you right now.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.231
You could save her life.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.146
Be a hero.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.278
Just by showing up...

14:48.322 --> 14:49.279
which is something--

14:52.543 --> 14:54.632
I wish my father had done.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.161
- Pre-op labs, pathology.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.990
- Surgical report.
Dr. was Gerald Tollman.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.861
You know him?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.951
- Nope. He left in 2011.
That was before my time.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.823
- "During procedure,
I discovered a tumor

15:11.867 --> 15:13.825
"strangling the patient's
spinal cord.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.785
"It was impossible to remove
without transecting the spine.

15:16.828 --> 15:20.093
Plate was necessary
to maintain stability."

15:20.136 --> 15:22.095
- That's a complete lie.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.052
Based on what Questa said.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.271
Based on what we saw.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.881
- Do you know
who else was in the room?

15:25.925 --> 15:29.363
- Yes. We have Maxine West,
anesthesia.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.625
Joe McGrain, scrub nurse.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.844
Easha Bashar,
circulating nurse.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.022
- What?

15:36.065 --> 15:38.894
Intern was...

15:38.938 --> 15:40.548
Clint Hartman.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.203
- Max, Max--please,
whatever you're gonna do--

15:43.246 --> 15:44.595
- He deserves.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.774
- So I said watch it.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.776
Jets tickets
are what you get your doctor

15:51.820 --> 15:53.996
when you don't like him.
- Give us the room, please.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.698
- Max.

16:08.010 --> 16:08.924
- What is it?

16:15.017 --> 16:17.977
- You lied.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.678
Max.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.375
I've told you again and again

16:25.419 --> 16:27.029
that there was nothing
that I could do.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.900
Georgia--
- I'm not here...

16:28.944 --> 16:31.033
to talk about her.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.384
- Okay, then, what?

16:34.428 --> 16:37.735
- Elizabeth Archer.
Gerald Tollman.

16:37.779 --> 16:41.870
You stood there while he put
her in a wheelchair for life.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.089
Deny it?

16:48.094 --> 16:49.399
- I can't.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.665
Dr. Tollman
was the department chair.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.624
It was my third surgery.

16:57.842 --> 16:58.756
He made a mistake.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.976
- A mistake?

17:02.804 --> 17:04.066
And you kept his secret.

17:05.415 --> 17:10.029
- He kept insisting
that I forget...

17:10.072 --> 17:12.770
what I'd seen.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.250
That's what doctors do.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.774
That's how we take care
of each other.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.995
I tried to believe him.
Wanted to believe him.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.522
But I knew I'd never
be able to live with myself,

17:25.566 --> 17:28.960
and so, unlike everybody else
in that room,

17:29.004 --> 17:30.353
I reported him.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.054
- You reported him?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.098
- The next day.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.795
- There's no record of that.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.059
- I am not surprised.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.104
- Sorry.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.150
You reported a doctor

17:44.193 --> 17:46.195
who covered up
a botched surgery,

17:46.239 --> 17:49.503
and there is no record
of an investigation?

17:49.546 --> 17:51.244
Who the hell
did you report him to?

17:51.287 --> 17:54.160
- The dean of medicine.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.597
Peter Fulton.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.817
I told him everything.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.167
Nothing happened.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.215
- Oh, whoa, whoa, Otis.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.217
I want you coming
from stage left, remember?

18:08.261 --> 18:09.175
- Why do we
have to move at all?

18:09.218 --> 18:10.741
- "Suit the action to the word,

18:10.785 --> 18:12.134
and the word to the action."

18:12.178 --> 18:13.657
It's "Hamlet."

18:13.701 --> 18:15.355
Anybody?

18:17.052 --> 18:18.140
Never mind.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.315
From the same spot.
Go ahead.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.969
- Up ahead, my lord.

18:21.012 --> 18:24.320
Yonder is the cave
we doth seek.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.148
Do you I really
have to say "doth?"

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
- Yes, you "doth."

18:31.893 --> 18:33.764
Just, uh...

18:33.808 --> 18:35.853
carry on, guys.
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

18:35.897 --> 18:38.073
I'm coming.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.338
- What do you think
you're doing?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.818
- Theater.
- A Greek tragedy?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.036
"Philoctetes?"

18:45.080 --> 18:46.342
- Yeah.
I think it'll be healing.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.996
- I think it's madness.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.084
- Why?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.521
- Iggy,
Nathan cannot play a soldier

18:51.565 --> 18:54.089
injured in the war
and cast off by the army.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.047
- Why not?
- Because he is a soldier

18:56.091 --> 18:58.093
injured in the war
cast off by the army.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.704
- He was not cast off.
He lost his leg.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.054
- But you cannot make him
relive that experience.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.274
It's too painful.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.232
What about some other play?

19:06.275 --> 19:07.842
Something lighter?

19:07.885 --> 19:09.496
- Such as?

19:09.539 --> 19:11.237
- "Mamma Mia."

19:11.280 --> 19:12.412
- That's a musical.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.197
- Okay.
"Mricchakatika."

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
I'm not familiar.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.462
- It's a Sanskrit play
written in 4th century B.C.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.639
by Bhasa.
It's a comedy, a joyful romp.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.206
- Okay, I'm not interested.
I want to stick with Sophocles.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.816
- I think it's a big mistake.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.209
- Why do you care so much?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.385
I picked "Philoctetes"
for a reason.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.431
The text gives words
to these soldiers'

19:31.474 --> 19:33.433
deepest and most vulnerable
thoughts and feelings.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.043
That is why I chose it,

19:35.086 --> 19:36.740
because that's what
they need right now, all right?

19:36.784 --> 19:38.568
Did Nathan say that he
doesn't want to do this?

19:38.612 --> 19:40.091
- No.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.092
But he's my patient.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.704
- Yeah, but he's my patient,
too.

19:44.835 --> 19:45.793
- Oh.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.236
- I understand
it took quite a while

19:54.280 --> 19:55.411
for you to get back
on your feet

19:55.455 --> 19:56.978
after your first surgery.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.589
- Yes, but that's because
I wasn't taking pain meds.

19:59.633 --> 20:03.289
- Yes, I spoke with your former
physical therapist, Dr. Ligon.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.552
- He's the worst, right?

20:05.595 --> 20:06.640
- Uh...

20:06.683 --> 20:08.207
I don't really
know him that well.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.210
- Well, you don't want to.

20:12.167 --> 20:16.432
- Well, he agreed that you were
ready for a second procedure.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.434
- Really?
So I'm cleared?

20:18.478 --> 20:20.741
- Yes, but before we schedule,

20:20.784 --> 20:24.527
we need to discuss
your post-op care.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.486
You may have opted out
of the meds before--

20:26.529 --> 20:28.314
- No, you know what?
I really don't need them.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.532
Trust me.
I've actually been working on

20:29.576 --> 20:30.664
some mental exercises--

20:30.707 --> 20:31.708
- No.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.842
- No?

20:35.712 --> 20:37.975
- Dr. Bloom, I respect
your commitment to sobriety,

20:38.019 --> 20:40.630
but won't be able to psych
your way through this.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.850
- But I've done it before.
I mean, it was tough--

20:42.893 --> 20:45.418
- This recovery
will be far more painful.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.202
And certainly more important.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.161
If drawn out, your mobility
could be permanently impaired.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.119
There's no way
you can get through this

20:51.162 --> 20:52.773
without painkillers.

20:52.816 --> 20:56.298
So the question isn't whether
you will be taking medication,

20:56.342 --> 20:59.170
but if you can find a way
to take it responsibly.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.267
- He's been waiting for you.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.616
- Can I help you?

21:09.659 --> 21:11.531
- Yeah, are you Dr. Reynolds?

21:11.574 --> 21:12.575
- Yes.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.185
- Um...

21:14.229 --> 21:16.710
I'm Makayla's dad.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.105
- We'll need to keep
the incision dry

21:21.149 --> 21:22.324
for at least 48 hours.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.021
- Yeah, of course.
- And when she wakes up--

21:24.065 --> 21:25.980
- I'm awake.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.898
How'd it go?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.511
Is the plate fixed?

21:38.079 --> 21:38.993
- It was removed.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.259
- I don't understand.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.871
- Dr. Questa took it out.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.918
- But if it's out,
how will I sit up?

21:54.095 --> 21:57.141
- Well, as it turns out,
you may not actually need it.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.840
- This doesn't make sense.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.538
I can't sit in my chair
without the plate.

22:02.582 --> 22:06.063
I have to be able to sit,
because if I can't do that,

22:06.107 --> 22:07.543
I can't do anything.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.765
- We'll have answers soon,
Elizabeth, I promise, but...

22:11.808 --> 22:16.378
but for now, that's all
I'm at liberty to say.

22:33.961 --> 22:34.918
- Ah.

22:38.705 --> 22:39.619
Right.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.536
Come on in.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.327
- Uh, forgive the mess.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.374
Had I known that
this was inquisition day,

22:55.417 --> 22:56.418
I'd have tidied.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.247
- A woman's in a wheelchair.

22:59.290 --> 23:02.337
- And you think
that I put her there.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.820
The man you should talk to
is Dr. Gerald Tollman.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.038
- This isn't about
a rogue doctor.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.257
This was a cover-up.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.563
You put the integrity
of this hospital--

23:10.606 --> 23:12.695
- The word I'm thinking about
isn't integrity,

23:12.739 --> 23:14.784
it's litigation.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.657
Cases like this
get hospitals shuttered.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.919
So as I only have a few minutes

23:18.962 --> 23:21.225
before I have to address
our board,

23:21.269 --> 23:23.184
let me get ahead
of the 5,000 lawyers

23:23.227 --> 23:26.013
who'll be coming for your scalp
by asking one question.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.884
What the hell
were you thinking?

23:36.153 --> 23:38.155
Are you smiling, Peter?

23:38.199 --> 23:39.374
- I'm sorry.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.768
I was trying
to dredge up my ashamed face,

23:41.811 --> 23:44.466
but it just wouldn't come.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.904
- Maybe you'd like to visit
Elizabeth's recovery room.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.299
- Okay.

23:51.342 --> 23:54.302
I'll put aside my pique
at your moralizing

23:54.345 --> 23:57.392
and just focus
on New Amsterdam.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.265
You're worried about lawsuits.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.920
So if I had gone
after Tollman's license,

24:03.964 --> 24:07.533
not only would he have sued,
he'd have won.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.100
- Clint Hartman
was ready to testify.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.494
- And who do you think
a jury would've believed, hmm?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.975
Gerald Tollman,
chair of neurosurgery

24:15.018 --> 24:17.325
with a list of accolades
longer than your arm,

24:17.368 --> 24:20.459
or his 28-year-old
intern Clint?

24:20.502 --> 24:23.113
- So your answer
was to do nothing?

24:23.157 --> 24:25.507
- Oh, no, my answer was
pulling him from rotation

24:25.551 --> 24:27.335
and getting him the hell
out of the hospital

24:27.378 --> 24:30.381
and making sure that
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.605
No lawsuits.
No headlines.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.955
The only trace is the grief
for Elizabeth Archer,

24:38.999 --> 24:41.654
which by the way, I share.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.352
And the knowledge that
because of my choices,

24:44.395 --> 24:46.702
New Amsterdam
has a neurosurgery department

24:46.746 --> 24:48.182
for you two to screw up.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.445
- You should've gone
to the board.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.843
- Dilettantes?
Billionaires?

24:56.886 --> 24:58.322
- They were your employers.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.542
- And not a doctor
among the bunch.

25:00.586 --> 25:04.415
Do you know any of these
doctors, Madame Brantley?

25:04.459 --> 25:05.547
Do you?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.157
The doctors who,
if all this came out,

25:07.201 --> 25:09.595
would've lost their jobs,
their professions?

25:09.638 --> 25:11.510
I protected them.

25:11.553 --> 25:15.644
I take care of my own,
and that is my legacy.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.298
And man, I am proud of it.

25:18.429 --> 25:21.215
- Your legacy is a profound
error in judgment,

25:21.258 --> 25:24.305
which I can relate to
as I made one myself

25:24.348 --> 25:26.568
when I didn't
fire your ass sooner.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.230
- Ah.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.014
The wrong end
of the Goodwin high horse.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.929
Oh, how I missed it.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.412
- I looked up to you.

25:47.763 --> 25:48.677
- I know.

25:51.027 --> 25:53.160
As a leader...

25:54.378 --> 25:57.425
The only question
worth asking...

25:58.774 --> 26:01.385
Is if the cost
of protecting New Amsterdam

26:01.429 --> 26:05.085
is your conscience,
will your pay?

26:05.128 --> 26:08.262
And if the answer is no...

26:09.480 --> 26:11.395
You're not the leader
you think you are.

26:11.439 --> 26:14.747
- St. Francis in Philadelphia,

26:14.790 --> 26:16.270
Rose Hill in Portland,

26:16.313 --> 26:18.098
County Children's in Chicago,

26:18.141 --> 26:19.534
all hospitals
Tollman has worked at

26:19.578 --> 26:20.796
since he crippled
Elizabeth Archer.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.971
It makes you wonder

26:22.015 --> 26:24.626
why he moves around so much,
doesn't it?

26:24.670 --> 26:29.500
Makes you wonder, how many more
Elizabeth Archers are there?

26:31.590 --> 26:32.765
- We do what we have to
to survive.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.984
- You do.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.423
I'm gonna make sure that man
never lifts another scalpel.

26:39.467 --> 26:40.511
- Max.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.953
Leaders makes choices
that keep them up at night.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.956
If you're sleeping well...

26:49.999 --> 26:51.958
you're not doing your job.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.099
- Never really done anything
like this before.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.058
- It's actually
a fairly simple procedure.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.886
We'll give you
regional anesthesia.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.452
That way,
you won't feel the needle.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.066
- Is that her?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.688
She got so big.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.435
- I think we should
keep it moving.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.402
- She was just a tiny little
thing the last time I saw her.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.711
- How long has it been?

27:51.017 --> 27:53.106
- I don't know.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.849
11...

27:56.892 --> 27:58.807
12 years.
12 years.

28:01.592 --> 28:02.724
- You...

28:02.768 --> 28:03.856
you still think about her?

28:03.899 --> 28:05.988
I mean, even though...

28:06.032 --> 28:07.686
- Your old man around?

28:10.166 --> 28:11.602
- No.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.261
- Maybe sometimes
that's not a bad thing.

28:24.528 --> 28:25.747
- Hey.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.966
- Hey.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.750
- So, uh...

28:28.794 --> 28:31.448
I got approved
for my second surgery.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.757
- Gosh, that's...

28:35.801 --> 28:36.889
that's great, isn't it?

28:36.932 --> 28:38.804
- Yeah, yeah, it's great.

28:38.847 --> 28:42.329
But Dr. Handler says that
I need to take pain meds.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.287
It's my only chance
of a full recovery.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.031
Being in the ED means
being quick on my feet.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.380
I can't...

28:50.424 --> 28:53.296
I can't risk my mobility.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.343
But if I try to do this
without meds...

28:56.386 --> 28:58.432
I don't know.
If...

28:58.475 --> 29:00.913
if the pain is as extreme
as Handler says it is,

29:00.956 --> 29:03.132
then...

29:05.395 --> 29:06.788
Then I might relapse.

29:11.401 --> 29:12.751
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know

29:12.794 --> 29:13.795
because, you know,
my pee tests and everything--

29:13.839 --> 29:15.101
- Lauren, we can modify

29:15.144 --> 29:16.798
your workplace
monitoring agreement

29:16.842 --> 29:18.539
to allow for prescribed meds.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.456
But more importantly,
right now,

29:22.499 --> 29:24.371
I think you need someone
who you can trust

29:24.414 --> 29:27.678
and who can dole out
your medication responsibly...

29:27.722 --> 29:29.158
and only when needed.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.247
- You're right.
I'll call my mother.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.731
- I would like
to be that person.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.343
- Trust me.
You wouldn't.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.304
- Your friend.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.490
- We're doing it out here
in front of all the visitors?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.144
- Um, yeah,
not just in front of visitors.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.146
I invited staff, too.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.844
Yes. Breaking out the uniform.
Nice.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.759
- My wife brought it for me.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.328
- Um, okay,
players, please.

30:08.371 --> 30:09.285
Come into the round.

30:09.329 --> 30:10.983
So...

30:11.026 --> 30:12.462
when you are not up here

30:12.506 --> 30:13.681
standing,
delivering your lines,

30:13.724 --> 30:15.335
I'd like you seated
on the bench.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.510
But most importantly,

30:16.553 --> 30:18.599
remember that
you need to stay open,

30:18.642 --> 30:22.429
present, and let Sophocles
be your voice, okay?

30:22.472 --> 30:24.126
Where's Nate?

30:24.170 --> 30:26.215
- Over there.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.695
- Oh.

30:27.738 --> 30:30.002
Okay, why don't you guys
play in the space, okay?

30:30.045 --> 30:31.699
Feel it out.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.744
Nate. Hey, we're about
to get started.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.704
- I can't do this, Dr. Frome.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.054
- Sure you can.
You just gotta read.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.969
- No, I tried.
I can't.

30:42.797 --> 30:43.711
It's too much.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.193
- Well, we can't do this
without you, buddy.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.412
- I know, I know.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.676
But the play is me.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.330
- Yeah.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.596
- It's my experience.
It's my words.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.687
I don't think I can say them.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.472
- I...

31:05.515 --> 31:07.430
I could say them for you.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.606
- Vijay? What are you...

31:12.174 --> 31:14.263
- If you will have me...

31:16.265 --> 31:19.878
I will assume Nathan's role.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.446
In his honor.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.103
- That's--that's a real nice
offer, Vijay,

31:28.147 --> 31:31.193
but this is
kind of for the soldiers.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.326
You know what I mean?

31:35.154 --> 31:37.808
Vijay--oh, okay.
Hang on.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.767
- My friends.

31:41.595 --> 31:44.206
I am Vijay Kapoor.

31:44.250 --> 31:47.514
I was
in the 4th Indian infantry.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.692
With your permission...

31:51.735 --> 31:54.303
I would like to join
your company.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.970
Why are you
telling me this now?

32:09.014 --> 32:11.059
- Because I've seen you
question yourself

32:11.103 --> 32:13.105
so many times.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.976
And blame yourself.

32:15.020 --> 32:18.501
Now you know that
none of this was your fault.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.722
- It was ours.

32:21.765 --> 32:25.595
- So everything
that happened to me was a lie.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.816
- The tumor was real, but...

32:28.859 --> 32:32.037
you didn't need to end up
in a wheelchair because of it.

32:37.085 --> 32:39.131
- Every six months
when I come to see you,

32:39.174 --> 32:42.656
you'd check on me, do a scan,
tell me I was doing better.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.701
- And there's no way
that she could've seen this

32:44.745 --> 32:46.007
without removing the plate.

32:47.661 --> 32:50.751
- So you want a gold star for
finally telling me the truth?

32:52.187 --> 32:53.406
- No.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.494
No, we want--

32:54.537 --> 32:56.322
- I don't care what you want.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.671
Here's what's gonna happen.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.368
- Elizabeth--
- No.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.893
I'm gonna get
the most blood-thirsty

33:02.937 --> 33:05.244
malpractice attorney
I can find,

33:05.287 --> 33:08.551
and I'm gonna sue this hospital
back to the Stone Age.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.869
- Where's Mr. Bell?

33:21.912 --> 33:22.913
- Finished his donation
and left.

33:31.139 --> 33:32.619
- Hey, Dr. Reynolds.

33:32.662 --> 33:35.491
Thanks for fixing my heart.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.058
- Anytime.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.192
- Was it hard
to find a donor?

33:40.235 --> 33:41.715
- You know,
sometimes it is,

33:41.758 --> 33:46.024
but today,
we got lucky.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.112
- Can I meet them?

33:49.462 --> 33:51.159
- They want to remain
anonymous.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.161
You know,
some people

33:53.205 --> 33:55.424
just figure that
they're better at a distance.

33:58.427 --> 33:59.776
- I'll be right back.
Okay, babe?

33:59.820 --> 34:01.039
- Okay.
- Right back.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.132
- So getting the marrow
is the first step.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.872
Now we have to use it,
all right?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.352
To do that,

34:10.396 --> 34:13.399
I'm going to have to wipe out
her system with chemo,

34:13.442 --> 34:16.402
and then rebuild it
with her father's stem cells.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.579
- Long road.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.407
- But she's got great odds.

34:22.973 --> 34:26.934
- Thank you for making
that call to her dad.

34:26.977 --> 34:29.067
- You were right about him.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.549
I guess I just wish
that he cared more.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.247
You know?

34:35.290 --> 34:36.944
That he'd hang around,

34:36.987 --> 34:40.034
you know,
and just do the right thing.

34:41.601 --> 34:43.081
- Well, he did.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.257
He showed up.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.826
We can all be grateful
for that, right?

34:49.870 --> 34:50.871
- Hm.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.063
- Aww.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.238
I knew you'd come limping--

35:10.282 --> 35:13.763
- Hose it down,
and listen up.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.330
After my surgery,

35:15.374 --> 35:16.592
I'm gonna have to take
pain pills.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.594
And because
I don't trust myself,

35:18.638 --> 35:20.292
I need someone else
to be in charge of them,

35:20.335 --> 35:22.511
someone who
is gonna give me hell

35:22.555 --> 35:24.600
if I ask for more
than I'm prescribed.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.733
Someone who understands
that for addicts,

35:26.776 --> 35:28.256
pain is safer than pleasure.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.172
Someone who has a high
threshold for verbal abuse,

35:31.216 --> 35:32.695
is unaffected
by human suffering,

35:32.739 --> 35:34.001
and who might sadistically

35:34.044 --> 35:36.177
enjoy controlling
my daily will to live.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.353
What I don't need is a friend.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.139
Am I crazy,
or are you my guy?

35:44.098 --> 35:45.317
- Both, it seems.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.754
- Good, so--
- Stop talking, Lauren.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.059
Let me be clear.

35:49.103 --> 35:52.193
I've been down the road
you're on several times,

35:52.237 --> 35:54.195
so I know all the tricks,
all the excuses,

35:54.239 --> 35:57.503
and all the lies.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.158
You're not gonna
get away with anything.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.209
- As the world's
most pathologically

36:08.253 --> 36:09.776
honorable doctor,

36:09.819 --> 36:12.605
I assume you've already told
Elizabeth Archer the truth.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.346
- You assume correctly.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.348
- Probably smart.
Too many people know.

36:16.391 --> 36:19.351
It's bound to get out.
Better to get ahead of it.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.487
- It's a big number.

36:25.531 --> 36:28.186
- Big enough
to convince her to settle?

36:28.229 --> 36:30.623
- Probably,
but I hope she doesn't.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.059
- You want her to sue us?

36:32.102 --> 36:33.582
- You and Fulton fought
like you're on opposite sides,

36:33.626 --> 36:34.670
but you're not.

36:34.714 --> 36:37.151
You're both advocating
for a cover-up.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.371
The only difference
is you're writing a check.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.069
- Better than gaslighting
the woman.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.766
- But not as good
as going public.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.551
I'm writing a new policy.

36:45.594 --> 36:46.943
Total transparency.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.249
I want to tell the world
about Tollman,

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
and let the chips fall
where they may.

36:49.859 --> 36:52.732
It's the only way to prevent
another Tollman from happening.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.516
- Well, he'll sue us, too.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.823
- So let him.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.520
- You're not thinking
this through, Max.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.696
If we broadcast
every subpar doctor

37:00.740 --> 37:02.263
and corner-cutting nurse
to the world,

37:02.307 --> 37:03.960
our image will be in tatters.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.485
We'll be the hospital
where you go to get killed.

37:06.528 --> 37:09.531
- No, we'll be the hospital
that holds doctors accountable.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.925
And we'll be the hospital
that sides with their patients

37:11.968 --> 37:13.056
no matter the price.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.233
I know it's not
a perfect solution,

37:15.276 --> 37:16.930
and I know
there will be consequences,

37:16.973 --> 37:19.280
but...

37:19.324 --> 37:21.326
this is the only way.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.288
- I hope so.

37:29.595 --> 37:32.598
Our careers
will be riding on it.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.303
- Soldier, do you dare defy me?

37:42.347 --> 37:44.436
Do you not see
my hand upon my sword?

37:46.176 --> 37:47.439
- I fear it not, sir.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.093
Long have I marched
under your standard,

37:50.137 --> 37:51.530
but today...

37:51.573 --> 37:54.750
you turned your back
on one of our own.

37:54.794 --> 37:57.710
Thus,
you turned your back on us all.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.932
- My actions must consider
the many, soldier,

38:02.976 --> 38:04.847
even at the expense of the few.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.159
I stand by my choice,

38:12.202 --> 38:14.988
for it is my charge
and duty to do so.

38:15.031 --> 38:18.296
- Then I shall obey
your command no longer.

38:18.339 --> 38:21.299
And for your soul,
I will pray.

38:22.604 --> 38:27.261
- ♪ And never our strength

38:27.305 --> 38:29.785
♪ Shall falter

38:36.792 --> 38:41.797
- I had grown accustomed
to my station here.

38:41.841 --> 38:47.150
Enduring it
as if lost in a dream.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.327
- Your medical records.

38:49.370 --> 38:52.373
- But today,
my eyes have been opened.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.635
Today, I awake.

38:53.679 --> 38:56.290
Too long
have I suffered adversity.

38:56.334 --> 39:01.774
Pain from the actions of those
entrusted with protecting me.

39:01.817 --> 39:06.518
Forging on,
my past shall not define me,

39:06.561 --> 39:09.608
even as I stand
afeard a resurgence

39:09.651 --> 39:15.701
of my true vulnerabilities.

39:17.659 --> 39:22.185
The time has come
at last to abandon this isle.

39:22.229 --> 39:25.275
To depart,
never to return.

39:29.541 --> 39:33.371
Fare thee well,
O home.

39:33.414 --> 39:37.592
Wait for my return no longer.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.942
Onward I must proceed

39:39.986 --> 39:43.337
with strength
in each footfall...

39:44.991 --> 39:50.126
Evermore haunted
with the memories...

39:50.170 --> 39:54.392
of the man I used to be.

39:57.438 --> 40:01.094
For my old home...

40:01.137 --> 40:04.532
is now behind me.

40:04.576 --> 40:09.668
Faith is my new home.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.095
- Guys, my players, everybody.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.053
What a performance.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.141
Wow.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.453
I never knew.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.196
- This wasn't something
I wish to speak about.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.197
Until now.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.373
- Come here.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.427
- Who's there?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.516
I'll be right back.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.049
What are you guys doing here?

41:27.093 --> 41:28.398
- It was her idea.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.792
- I know that you said
you don't want strangers

41:30.836 --> 41:35.188
in your house,
but we're not strangers.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.972
And I am fairly certain

41:37.016 --> 41:39.366
that you have a sink
full of dirty dishes.

41:39.409 --> 41:43.152
- Just FYI,
I don't do windows.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.632
- Lauren, you can barely stand.

41:44.676 --> 41:47.983
- True, but I'm good
at giving orders.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.815
- It's okay to let people in.
