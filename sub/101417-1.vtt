Great idea till you realize

00:19.960 --> 00:23.880
Mum, it's true. People are coming
into the country and taking all the jobs.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.880
Oh, my God, I've raised a Tory.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.160

She's very powerful.

That coat was Stella McCartney.

Well, Millie is dyslexic,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.320
Millie is dicks-lexic.

Mmm, dyslexic. Maybe a coffee morning?

No more coffee mornings.
None of you need more caffeine.

It's like a high school yearbook.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.160
Well, Cameron sounds good.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.560
"Always got a friendly smile."

11:02.640 --> 11:04.400
[laughs] He's happy
because he's a 19-year-old

11:04.480 --> 11:06.760
who just quit his paper route
to jerk off for cash.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.360
You sure you can't just do this with Evan?

11:09.440 --> 11:12.920
Yes. I've reached my maximum
estranged baby's fathers.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.600
Look. Shep's challenging, all right,

11:14.680 --> 11:17.280
but, come on, Evan's hot.
Evan's got a job.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.040
Exactly. He could pay for better lawyers
and destroy me when we split.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.880
Why does your mind automatically go
to the worst-case scenario?

11:23.960 --> 11:26.400
What if you and Evan just worked out?

11:26.480 --> 11:27.880
Now you sound insane.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.320
There <i>will </i>be a problem with Evan.
When I find out what it is,

11:30.400 --> 11:31.920
I won't be tethered to him with a baby.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.360
Don't have two then.
You nailed it the first time.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.120
What if I could nail it again?

11:36.200 --> 11:38.520
You know what? If it'll stop you
getting another mouse dog...

11:38.600 --> 11:41.520
Look at 'em! They just shiver
and piss from their eyes.

11:43.120 --> 11:43.960
[dog whimpers]

11:50.160 --> 11:51.760

11:53.720 --> 11:56.240
Oh, hey!
Sorry about today.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.880
<i>Hey, it's okay.</i>
<i>I just wanted to show you something.</i>

12:01.120 --> 12:03.360
It's a Thai restaurant called Thai Tanic.
[laughs]

12:03.440 --> 12:05.600
Oh, that's the best one so far.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.520
Uh, pretty sure it blows everything
you've ever had out of the water.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.800
It beats The Codfather
and it beats Abrakebabra, baby.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.040
Mmm, you're kicking my ass.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.280
Oh, you will never beat Thai Tanic.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.760
Oh, I will. One day, I will.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.880
-I'm going to bed. Love you.
-[Evan] <i>I love-- </i>[phone beeps]

12:31.520 --> 12:35.600
[gentle piano music plays]

12:50.920 --> 12:53.720
Millie's mummy told her
you're terribly immature.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.520
Ha! Millie's mummy is a mess.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.200
And she also said
that's why Daddy left you.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.320
Is that true?

13:01.760 --> 13:03.360
I love your Daddy very much.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.000
Because he's such a clever man?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.040
He is a genius.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.520
Do you fancy my daddy?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.920
Yep! How could I not? He's so gorgeous.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.000
But then, how come my daddy's
not your boyfriend?

13:16.840 --> 13:18.360
That is because, um,

13:18.440 --> 13:21.080
your dad's, like, <i>too </i>good for me.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.520
Yeah. That's how amazing your daddy is.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.720
-[sings] You've got a crush on my daddy!
<i>-</i>Oh, big time! [chuckles]

13:33.840 --> 13:35.040
-What's that?
-Look!

13:35.120 --> 13:37.000
I made it for Millie
so that she'll be my friend.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.520
Aw, honey, you don't have to be
everyone's friend.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.360
-[Shep yells]
-Daddy!

13:41.440 --> 13:43.400
-[he laughs]
-[Katherine] Stop doing that!

13:43.480 --> 13:45.640
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to do pick-up.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.640
I thought you might like some meat
for the dogs.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.880
The dogs are vegan.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.640
You can't have vegan dogs.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.160
Birthday weekend! Yay!

13:54.240 --> 13:56.520
I'll grab you after school
and we'll have so much fun.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.640
-We're gonna have a barbecue! Yeah!
-[Olive] Yay, meat!

14:00.040 --> 14:01.920
-Bye, Mummy, love you.
-[Katherine] Love you.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.960
Oh, and Daddy?

14:03.400 --> 14:04.960
My mummy's got a crush on you.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.680
[sighs] She misunderstood.
I said I'm going to crush you.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.080
Like I'd be afraid of a left-wing cunt
who won't eat cheese.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.160
Who said that? Shep? Oh, there you are.
You blend in so well to your surroundings.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.760
-You just get back from Afghanistan?
-You look like an art dealer's widow.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.480
Lucky her. My psychic promised me
you'd be dead two years ago.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.320
Unlikely. I'm one of the strongest men
on the planet right now.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.240
-Strongest smelling.
-That smell is pure testosterone.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.640
[groans] I gotta get back.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.960
Bev and I are working on
a big new commission from Adele.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.160
She saw us in <i>The Guardian.</i>

14:34.240 --> 14:35.480
[scoffs] <i>The Guardian?</i>

14:36.280 --> 14:37.240
Adele?

14:37.320 --> 14:39.960
Jealous someone's still making records?
You...

14:41.520 --> 14:43.080
Hold on. There's Millie.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.680
-Kid that's been giving Olive a hard time?
-[Katherine] Yeah.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.800
Ah. I know her dad, Brian.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.920
He's in my Pilates class.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.840
Runs that plumbing business
on the broadway.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.840
[Katherine] Interesting.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.600
[Millie scoffs]

14:58.760 --> 15:00.440
-[gasps] Motherfucker!
-[Shep] No! Leave it!

15:00.520 --> 15:02.040
Leave it! You'll embarrass her.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.520
I've given Olive a fundamental
understanding of tae kwon do.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.960
-She's choosing not to use it.
-Let me fucking go!

15:07.040 --> 15:10.080
Calm, calm. Woosah, woosah, huh?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.560
Hey, see?

15:16.440 --> 15:18.880
You do not get a say
in how I parent <i>my </i>daughter.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.520
She's not your daughter, shithead.
She's <i>our </i>daughter.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.080
Yeah. Thanks to me.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.920
Stupid prick.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.000
[Evan] So she goes to pay her bill
and the daughter says to me...

15:45.080 --> 15:48.400
"Are you very poor? My house is
much bigger than this ugly little office."

15:48.480 --> 15:49.720
-[Katherine] No!
-Six years old!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.720
The entitlement is extraordinary.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.640
You're never too young
to be an asshole, though.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.360
I hate to say it, but I regretted
giving her such a good filling.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.920
-[they laugh]
-[man] Another bottle?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.440
Oh, yes, please, man.
It was the Argentinian Malbec.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.400
-You having a good night?
-[Katherine] Yeah.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.840
-A much-needed break from the little one?
-[laughs] Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.200
Why would you agree with him?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.680
I don't need a break from Olive.
I like her.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.360
Hey, I was just saying
it's nice to be having this time,

16:13.440 --> 16:16.720
-just the two of us occasionally.
-Every weekend is not occasionally.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.520
It's too long
to be away from your own kid.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.040
She's with her dad.
I... I thought this was cool?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.120
I wish she never went over there.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.560
Then why do you let him see her?

16:24.640 --> 16:27.240
Because he's her dad,
and love don't cost a thing.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.760
J. Lo. You're right, it's always J. Lo.
Look...

16:31.480 --> 16:32.400
I'm sorry, can...

16:33.080 --> 16:33.920
Can we start again?

16:34.440 --> 16:36.840
I just feel like
I should be using this time to sleep.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.840
Katherine, I didn't mean to offend you.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.400
Sorry.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.680
I've had a lot on my mind. Um...

16:44.920 --> 16:46.680
[sighs] I've been meaning to tell you...

16:46.760 --> 16:47.720
Yeah?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.240
[sighs]

16:50.720 --> 16:52.280
I'm ready to have another baby.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.400
Uh...

16:56.840 --> 16:57.680
Okay.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.960
This is a big step. This is bigger
than what I thought you wanted, but...

17:05.080 --> 17:07.120
You know what? [bangs table]
Fuck it. Yes.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.760
Yes, yes, yes. I'm in. I'm in, 100%.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.480
-When do you want to start trying?
-Soon.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.440
Truth is, Katherine,
uh, we're on exactly the same page.

17:13.520 --> 17:17.440
How about this?
How about we start with me moving in?

17:17.520 --> 17:20.400
I've actually already got some boxes
packed. I've got a little papoose.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.240
I would never carry a hot drink
over the baby.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.840
That's out of the question.
I'm very responsible in that sense.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.520
Am I talking too much? Should I back up?
I'll do whatever it takes,

17:27.600 --> 17:28.960
-is what I'm trying to...
-Um...

17:29.040 --> 17:30.600
-[Evan] ...say.
-Okay...

17:30.680 --> 17:32.320
-no.
[Evan] No, okay.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.880
I need to do this with a sperm donor.
It's the safest way for me.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.080
-Sperm don--
-[waiter] Here we are!

17:39.160 --> 17:40.160
Can you give us a minute?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.880
[laughs] God, I thought you were
being serious for a minute there.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.560
-I'm not joking.
-[laughs] Yeah, right!

17:53.160 --> 17:55.600
Yeah, you have a donor baby
so that it's all yours

17:55.680 --> 17:58.680
and you keep me at a safe distance
so nothing changes for you.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.440
Oh, fuck me, you mean it.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.400
Well, I feel really badly about it,
though.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.400
Don't you love me?

18:06.480 --> 18:09.200
I do love you. That's the problem.
I hate Shep.

18:09.280 --> 18:13.560
You were a 23-year-old girl who got
pregnant by a lunatic in a boy band. You--

18:13.640 --> 18:16.320
-You didn't love him.
-But I thought I did.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.520
[Evan] Well, I'm not Shep.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.800
I'm not gonna end up in rehab
and lose my record deal,

18:19.880 --> 18:22.560
because I don't have a record deal.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.880
I have a medical degree.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.080
I know you're not Shep,
but you could hurt me way worse.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.920
I just want us to keep dating.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
I... I'm not breaking up with you.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.840
Oh, you're not? That's...
Ah, well, thank you very much.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.320
Well, I don't wanna lose you!

18:35.840 --> 18:39.840
Equally, I don't wanna be trapped
with you. Do you understand?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.800
[exasperated] Fuck me.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.000
[waiter] One minute!

18:43.080 --> 18:46.080
A lot of waiters say one minute and then
you never see them again, but me,

18:46.160 --> 18:48.480
-I'm right in here.
-Mate, can you fuck off?

18:58.400 --> 18:59.960
How about I just take you straight home?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.240
-But we made anal plans for your place.
-[Evan] Right.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.040
That's what I'm saying.
Let's leave that part of this evening out.

-[Bev] <i>Absolutely.</i>

to say you were joking.

and then they had Solange.

Solange is the true visionary
of that family and you know it.

No, I love him!

I don't want you only on the weekends.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.920
I want you, but both of you,
to be my first priorities all the time.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.120
Think about it. You, by some miracle,
got Olive out of Shep.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.880
Shep!

22:24.960 --> 22:27.640
Imagine what you could get
out of a decent guy.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.880
I did get Olive out of Shep.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.600
I don't think it's your place
to decide that a kid doesn't get a dad.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.200
I love you.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.680
And it's cold out here.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.720
-Oh, sorry. Yeah, come in.
-[Evan laughs]

22:52.880 --> 22:54.520
[school bell rings]

23:07.240 --> 23:08.760
What is the meaning of this?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.280
[gasps mockingly]

23:10.360 --> 23:12.040
My private naked photos!

23:12.120 --> 23:15.040
Oh, Jane, we didn't want you
to find out this way.

23:15.120 --> 23:20.600
These appeared on my husband's desk in an
envelope marked, "Urgent plumbing quote."

23:20.680 --> 23:23.360
I mean,
he was horrified when he opened it!

23:23.440 --> 23:25.280
The truth is I wanted to tell you...

23:25.360 --> 23:28.440
[loudly] ...about our ongoing love affair
and he must have panicked.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.960
[scoffs] My husband is not
having an affair with you.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.800
Mr. Michaels! Mr. Michaels!

23:35.880 --> 23:37.040
-Wh--
-Excuse me, Mr. Michaels.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.400
I'm sorry, but Jane has just brought
pornography into the playground.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.360
Whoa, what?

23:41.440 --> 23:44.680
It's wildly malicious, Mr. Michaels,
but I've chosen not to press charges

23:44.760 --> 23:47.000
-against the school.
-[chuckles nervously]

23:47.080 --> 23:48.320
Oh, dear.

23:48.400 --> 23:52.600
No! She's planted these
in an attempt to seduce my husband!

23:53.160 --> 23:54.400
Brian?

23:54.480 --> 23:57.280
As physically disgusting
and ham-colored as Brian may be,

23:57.360 --> 23:59.280
you have to find it in your heart
to forgive him

23:59.360 --> 24:02.120
-for taking these naked pics.
-They're bloody selfies!

24:02.200 --> 24:04.040
Mrs. Wooms, I must respectfully request

24:04.120 --> 24:06.280
that you remove yourself
from school property at once,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.640
because I'm almost certain what you've
done here this morning is illegal.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.000
Especially because you can see my pussy
in this one.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.040
-Oh, dear, just...
-Thank you.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.080
I am so sorry, Jane.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.640
That was just a warning.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.480
[school bell rings]

24:30.200 --> 24:31.160
[Olive] Mummy!

24:33.040 --> 24:34.920
[Katherine] Hi! Oh!

24:35.000 --> 24:37.360
Did you have a lovely time?

24:37.440 --> 24:39.600
Yeah, I went swimming
and I shot a squirrel in the face.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.680
Wow.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.280
[Shep] Yeah. She's getting to be
a really good little game hunter.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.040
-Bye, Daddy!
-[kisses]

24:46.160 --> 24:48.480
-[Olive] See you later, Mum. Bye!
-Bye.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.480
She got all her shit pretty caked in mud
at the survival class.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.480
Great. I need to talk to you.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.360
If this is about that meat for the dogs,
I didn't know it was stolen.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.560
I heard about that venison heist over
my police scanner, same as everyone else.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.520
No, I assumed it was stolen.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.360
Grocery stores are giant
corporate tax thieves anyway,

25:06.440 --> 25:07.960
putting small butchers out of business.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.560
I haven't set foot inside a Starbucks,
any Starbucks, since they first opened.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.720
Yeah, 'cause you're a rebel who's smarter
than everybody else. I got that. Listen!

25:16.240 --> 25:18.160
I am going to have another baby.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.480
Yeah, I can tell. You look like shit.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.480
It was either that or leukemia.
Could have both.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.880
No, I am not pregnant,
you GI Joe crackhead.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.080
I am <i>going </i>to have another baby,

25:29.480 --> 25:30.640
with a sperm donor.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.720
[laughs]

25:33.240 --> 25:36.120
You're gonna stick some pathetic
random loser's spunk up yourself?

25:36.200 --> 25:37.560
[laughs sarcastically]

25:37.640 --> 25:38.480
Yeah.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.400
Yours.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.240
-What do you mean, mine?
-Well, I've been thinking for some time

25:44.320 --> 25:48.600
that, even though you are, by far,
the <i>worst </i>human being that I have ever met

25:48.680 --> 25:51.280
and I wish you a lifetime
of pain and misery...

25:52.120 --> 25:54.120
we somehow made the best kid.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.240
And she needs a sibling.

25:59.000 --> 25:59.880
[tuts and sighs]

26:00.600 --> 26:01.480
[scoffs]

26:02.120 --> 26:03.400
I knew this would happen.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.800
You knew what would happen?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.240
-You want to get back on my dick.
-Christ! No.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.480
I've been to a fertility clinic.
We would do it there.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.200
[inhales] Hmm.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.360
Yeah, I'm gonna have expenses.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.640
You've dedicated your entire life
to being a wanker,

26:17.720 --> 26:20.200
you might as well start
getting paid for it. Fine.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.400
It's an interesting proposition, Kit.

26:23.760 --> 26:24.800
So is that a yes?

26:26.040 --> 26:28.760
I'm gonna need some time
to talk it over with my legal team.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.800
Great.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.520
Okay.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.200
[sighs] They love me.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.680
Even when they hate me, they love me.
