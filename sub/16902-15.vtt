WEBVTT

00:05.805 --> 00:06.840
Kenneth, I'm gonna duck uptown

00:06.840 --> 00:07.874
and have lunch with my boyfriend.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.376
Yes, ma'am.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.911
Oh, is that code for some kind
of older gal medical procedure?

00:11.911 --> 00:13.980
No, Kenneth, I really
have a boyfriend.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.382
Look, he's handsome
and a doctor.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.416
A doctor?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.151
Well, don't get too attached.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.420
As soon as people realize
his tonics don't work

00:20.420 --> 00:21.755
it's on to the next town.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.758
Hey, Ken, you know
what I have a craving for?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
Jerk chicken from that
place in Mill Basin?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.495
And some...

00:28.495 --> 00:31.364
Catalog photos of expectant
mothers in their swimming suits?

00:31.364 --> 00:33.833
You're my Radar O'Reilly, Ken.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.461
Now get in here and rub my feet
till you hear a chopper coming.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.539
Lemon...

00:39.539 --> 00:41.007
How's Tracy?

00:41.007 --> 00:42.008
What's his mood?

00:42.008 --> 00:43.209
Oh, upbeat and confused.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.078
Oh, perfect. You know
his contract is up.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.346
Has it been that long?

00:46.346 --> 00:48.515
Boy, we sure have done some
crazy things with Tracy

00:48.515 --> 00:49.582
in the last three years.

00:49.582 --> 00:51.885
We sure have.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.854
I'm thinking about some of them now.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.023
Me too.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.192
Anyway, I'm handling
the Tracy thing myself.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.428
Right, play hardball,
get your business jollies.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.729
Oh, sadly, not this time.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.098
With Tracy, it's not
about money anymore.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.300
His video game made a fortune
and he invested all of it

01:07.300 --> 01:09.903
in a company that dismantles bank signs.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.137
They're doing very well.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.705
You don't think he's gonna leave, do you?

01:12.705 --> 01:14.340
Oh, don't worry.
When you're above money

01:14.340 --> 01:16.810
personal relationships become
your currency.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.370
Tracy and I have become, uh, quite close.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.215
Look, we got B.F.F. bracelets.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.616
You guys are best friends forever?

01:23.616 --> 01:24.981
That's not what that stands for.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.091
Why would you celebrate that?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.359
So tell me where you
went to school again?

01:33.359 --> 01:34.627
Well, uh, I...

01:34.627 --> 01:35.728
Hey, you look really nice today.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.230
Thank you.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.665
Do you know her?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.800
No, I don't think so.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.936
Oh, wait! No, no!
Uh, that's my car!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.137
Meter's expired.

01:44.137 --> 01:45.104
I forgot to get quarters.

01:47.006 --> 01:49.342
You know what?
I got quarters.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.810
Thanks, Officer.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.745
You're welcome.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.215
Boy, people sure are nice to you.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.983
Yeah, I guess.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.685
Excuse me. I'm Calvin Klein

01:58.685 --> 02:01.921
and I think you should be
my next underwear model.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.286
Whoa, thanks!

02:04.624 --> 02:06.826
You don't wanna get a card
or... a phone number?

02:06.826 --> 02:08.258
He'll figure it out.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.150 --> 02:31.351
Hey.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.886
You went to Plunder for lunch?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.020
How did you get a table?

02:34.020 --> 02:35.421
I don't know.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.390
It was packed but they just gave Drew a table.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.892
It is ridiculous
how people treat him.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.995
The chef sent over food.
Ladies sent drinks.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.063
Mayor Bloomberg asked him to dance.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.554
Well, beautiful people are
treated differently from...

02:48.001 --> 02:49.068
moderately pleasant-looking people.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.236
It's true.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.471
They live in a bubble...

02:51.471 --> 02:53.406
a bubble of free drinks, kindness

02:53.406 --> 02:54.674
and outdoor sex.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.342
How did Drew turn out as well as he did

02:56.342 --> 02:57.644
going through life like that?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.212
The bubble isnit always
a bad thing. Look at me.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.580
I turned out okay, didn't I?

03:00.580 --> 03:03.550
Jack, I want you to pay close attention

03:03.550 --> 03:05.752
to the following over-the-top eye-roll.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.187
Oh, brother.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.323
Lemon, I don't share this often...

03:10.323 --> 03:11.858
but this is a photo of me

03:11.858 --> 03:13.860
when I was 25 years old.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.564
What the what?!
You have a Superman chest!

03:17.564 --> 03:19.566
I know.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.101
Oh, my God, the lady will have
two tickets to the gun show!

03:22.101 --> 03:23.770
And your eyes were
so much bluer.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.104
What happened to your eyes?

03:25.104 --> 03:27.674
My point is, Lemon, the bubble
doesn't last forever.

03:27.674 --> 03:31.077
So get in there with Drew and
enjoy those perks while you can.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.245
Can I keep that?

03:32.245 --> 03:35.544
Uh, no.
It's my only copy.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.353
Everyone, gather 'round, please.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.789
Actor announcement.
As you probably know

03:42.789 --> 03:46.092
especially if you read page
six... of my publicist's e-mails

03:46.092 --> 03:49.295
I have decided to cut my hair
and donate it to charity.

03:49.295 --> 03:52.131
But Miss Maroney, why would you
cut your beautiful hair?

03:52.131 --> 03:53.700
You look just how

03:53.700 --> 03:55.602
I picture Mary Magdalene.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.070
Well, because, Kenneth, I am a selfless person

03:57.070 --> 03:58.738
who can't get arrested in this town.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.708
Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan's face
is everywhere.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.176
Jenna, I already explained that.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.577
That was a police sketch of
a flasher who happened

04:04.577 --> 04:06.546
to look like Tracy... we hope.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.981
Whatever. He's hogging the buzz.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.048
You've got buzz.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.675
You were in that magazine that time.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.955
I don't even know what you're referring to

04:15.955 --> 04:16.944
and that was two years ago.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.860
As usual, I have to create
my own opportunities.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.129
No one will be talking
about Tracy Jordan this Friday

04:23.129 --> 04:25.563
when I cut my hair off on The Today Show.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.332
You're what I think Judas looks like.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.642
Tracy, I hope you know how much
we value you here at T.G.S.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.044
I like to think of this staff...

04:38.044 --> 04:39.479
as a family.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.047
This is better than a family.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.683
No one around here asks me for
my damn bone marrow.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.052
Well, why don't we make this easy on ourselves

04:46.052 --> 04:47.387
and renew your existing contract

04:47.387 --> 04:50.823
with a 3% increase.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.383
Okay.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.195
Sorry it took me so long to answer.

04:56.195 --> 04:59.132
I was just thinking about how
weird it is that we eat birds.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.067
All right, we have a deal.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.735
You see how easy negotiating can be

05:02.735 --> 05:04.203
when it's not
really about money.

05:04.203 --> 05:06.739
How is this really not about money?

05:06.739 --> 05:08.875
Well, obviously you don't need to work.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.677
What's that now, Charles?

05:10.677 --> 05:13.146
I'm just saying, you made $300 million

05:13.146 --> 05:14.881
Iast year, so there's
no financial need

05:14.881 --> 05:16.816
for you to continue with the show but...

05:16.816 --> 05:19.352
I never thought of it like that.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.887
Thank you.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.222
I quit. Good-bye.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.591
Uh... Tracy?

05:25.591 --> 05:29.028
Had he really not put that together?

05:29.028 --> 05:31.898
Tracy's is a tactile-kinesthetic
learning style...

05:31.898 --> 05:35.163
Dotcom...
so help me God.

05:38.571 --> 05:41.040
It's nice of those guys
to give up their court for us.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.701
Yes... for us.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.248
So I should probably warn you,
I was pro in college.

05:49.248 --> 05:50.850
What?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.753
Yeah, I started teaching kids at
the Y and then all their mothers

05:53.753 --> 05:54.887
wanted to take private lessons from me.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.377
But I promise I'll take it easy on you.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.044
It's been a long time since college, huh?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.545
What do you mean?

06:19.545 --> 06:20.546
Excuse me...

06:20.546 --> 06:22.070
do you give lessons?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.625
Now what is this?

06:32.625 --> 06:35.128
Dr. Drew's salmon bourguignon.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.230
What is this orange-y taste?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.219
Gatorade.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.531
Yeah.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.069
That was awesome.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.655
Are you choking?
Are you choking?

07:02.655 --> 07:04.290
I'm a doctor.
Stay calm, stay calm.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.848
I just need... I just
need to shake it loose.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.694
Wait, donit panic.
I just need

07:08.694 --> 07:09.762
to find something to push it down with.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.797
Do you have a chopstick

07:10.797 --> 07:13.132
or a fireplace match or something?

07:14.700 --> 07:17.032
There ya go!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.642
Jack, there you are.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.944
I need to talk to you about something.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.547
The Tracy deal is a process,
Lemon. We are... in process.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.549
No, something happened with Drew.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.550
Oh no, he's not a B.F.F.?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.185
Ugh, no! Never!

07:32.185 --> 07:33.553
It's the bubble.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.022
He is a doctor who doesn't know
the Heimlich Maneuver.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.024
He can't play tennis,
he can't cook...

07:38.024 --> 07:42.028
he's as bad at sex as I am.
But he has no idea!

07:42.028 --> 07:43.930
That is the danger of being super-handsome.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.832
When you're in the bubble,
nobody ever tells you the truth.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.200
For years...

07:47.200 --> 07:48.568
I thought I spoke excellent French.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.739
Drew deserves to be told the truth.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.374
He's a good person

07:55.374 --> 07:59.479
who is a victim of our nation's
obscene cult of superficiality.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.648
Okay, Lemon, did you tell him
that he was no good in tennis?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.916
No, I let him win

08:03.916 --> 08:04.917
'cause I wanted to make out with
him in the cab.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.820
It's not fair

08:07.820 --> 08:09.222
to let Drew live a lie.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.523
And I think I'm the woman to fix him.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.991
Be careful, Lemon.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.894
You wake a sleepwalker, you risk
getting urinated on.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.328
Or thanked... on.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.866
Hey, Kenneth!

08:19.866 --> 08:21.200
Mr. Jordan quit!

08:21.200 --> 08:22.690
What?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.004
I thought you were "in process."

08:25.004 --> 08:26.873
Tracy is taking a strong position right now

08:26.873 --> 08:27.940
in the negotiation.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.242
It's not unheard of for him

08:29.242 --> 08:31.244
to stay home while I formulate
my counter-proposal.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.410
What if it doesn't work?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.313
What if he doesn't come back?

08:34.313 --> 08:36.716
Oh, no! When I get upset

08:36.716 --> 08:37.876
my accent come out.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.513
And when it gets to comin' out,
I can't get to talkin', nuh-uh!

08:42.922 --> 08:44.222
Jack, I have a show on Friday.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.125
It will be rectified.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.193
I didn't mean to upset
you, Miss Lemon.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.928
Mr. Donaghy told us not to tell you

08:48.928 --> 08:50.263
but I couldn't hold it
in any more.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.027
Wait a minute, are you hiding
your screw-up from me?

08:54.567 --> 08:55.935
Don't cling to this, Lemon.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.571
Be a manager.
Control your people.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.106
Buy better clothes.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.108
I'm allowing this because I made a misstep.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.977
I'm handling it, and Tracy will
be here by Friday night.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.512
Just get it done.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.002
Nope, I lost it,
that was Batman.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.787
Thank you, Team Jenna, for being here.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.156
Obviously, my Today Show
charity haircut is just

09:17.156 --> 09:18.958
the first step in my reinvention.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.793
This is serial killer language.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.828
My mother's boyfriend raised me
to believe that a woman's hair

09:22.828 --> 09:24.530
is her crowning glory.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.265
A haircut can make
or break a career.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.100
Before "The Rachel," Jennifer Aniston was just

09:28.100 --> 09:30.002
a chunky nobody who couldn't get a job.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.637
Wasn't she already on Friends?

09:31.637 --> 09:33.239
Richard Esposito, move to the back.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.308
But if I make the wrong choice

09:35.308 --> 09:38.110
I could end up like Keri
Russell, Felicity, season two.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.412
Okay, let's
brainstorm.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.681
Everyone shout out words
that describe my beauty.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.748
Fading.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.749
'80s.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.716
1880s.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.254
Hey, you needed me?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.122
Lemon, you know Rick from accounting.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.157
I don't. Hi.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.458
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:52.458 --> 09:55.761
I've arranged for one of
Tracy's childhood idols

09:55.761 --> 09:58.631
to reach out to him.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.834
Hello?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.135
Tracy, this is Jack.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.037
I have someone here who
wants to speak with you.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.039
Tracy, this is Bill Cosby.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.941
Really?
This is your strategy?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.309
I heard him do this at a party.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.145
I want you to come back to
the T.G.S. for the people

10:13.145 --> 10:15.047
who like the jokes and the things.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.950
Bill Cosby, you got a lot
of nerve getting on the phone

10:17.950 --> 10:20.186
with me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.655
I think you're confusing me
with someone else.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.625
1971, Cincinnati.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.693
She was the cocktail waitress
with the droopy eye.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.795
I'm the guy with the pudding...

10:29.795 --> 10:31.597
Try to tell me what to do?

10:31.597 --> 10:32.898
Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable...

10:32.898 --> 10:35.668
with your light-ass kids!

10:35.668 --> 10:37.937
Jack? Why would you make me
talk to this man?

10:37.937 --> 10:39.739
Uh, Tracy, don't hang up.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.540
Tracy, this is
Billy Dee Williams.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.175
I just wanna say I love your work.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.200
It's very smooth.

10:54.854 --> 10:55.921
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.657
Why are you waiting here?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.026
Well, I put our name in, but
it's gonna be a 45-minute wait.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.561
What? I'll go talk to the hostess.

11:02.561 --> 11:05.164
No. I want to show you something.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.166
We're going to wait for the table.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.758
Okay.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.605
I hate this.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.708
Yeah, this is gonna be unpleasant.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.177
As Tracy's family and inner circle

11:18.177 --> 11:19.879
I wanted to enlist your help.

11:19.879 --> 11:22.581
While I'm sure all of you
treasure him being home more...

11:22.581 --> 11:24.450
I'm sorry, you want our help?

11:24.450 --> 11:25.718
With your problem?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.853
Donaghy, you need to get
our father back to work.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.422
That's what I'm trying to do.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.356
You wanna see what he packed me
for lunch today?

11:32.425 --> 11:35.861
Mayonnaise... and a pack of cigarettes.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.096
That is unfortunate.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.965
He set up a home recording
studio in our rec room!

11:39.965 --> 11:42.635
# My girl has a fat neck?

11:42.635 --> 11:44.637
I'm sharp, let's do it again.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.972
Thanks to you, I now have
an unemployed father.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.608
You trying to make a stereotype out of me?

11:49.608 --> 11:51.110
Did you even vote for Obama?

11:51.110 --> 11:53.713
We've heard from Tracy Jr.
Uh, where is your mother?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.015
She said she had to take a spa
week at Canyon Ranch

11:56.015 --> 11:57.249
before my dad broke it in half.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.918
What that even
supposed to mean?

11:58.918 --> 12:00.619
I shouldn't have to hear that!
I'm a child!

12:00.619 --> 12:02.655
Tracy Jr., uh, George Foreman...

12:02.655 --> 12:04.156
I want to get
your father back

12:04.156 --> 12:05.658
to work just as much as you do.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.359
But what do I offer the man
who has everything?

12:07.359 --> 12:08.728
I don't know what to do.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.963
I didn't come here to hear more excuses.

12:10.963 --> 12:14.233
I came here to see the dumbest
cracker in all of New York.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.335
You gotta fix this, Donaghy!
Fix this!

12:16.335 --> 12:18.704
You know, I don't see it on the menu

12:18.704 --> 12:21.140
but I would love a catfish po'boy

12:21.140 --> 12:23.309
and a diet raspberry Fanta.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.410
Oh, that is a great idea.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.979
Let me order that for you.
Excuse me...

12:26.979 --> 12:29.849
we will have a turkey burger deluxe and

12:29.849 --> 12:33.486
a catfish po'boy with
a diet raspberry Fanta.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.287
I'm gonna come back in five minutes.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.756
You try to order off the menu again

12:36.756 --> 12:39.258
I will smack those glasses off
your face.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.160
Okay, thank you.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.252
You're welcome.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.432
What was that? Why didn't
she call you "sweetheart"?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.101
And where's the complimentary
apps sampler? What's going on?

12:49.101 --> 12:52.036
Okay, Drew, this is how most people live.

12:53.472 --> 12:57.676
See, because of your whole,
you know, Disney prince thing...

12:57.676 --> 12:59.211
Actually, they used footage of
me from my high school swim team

12:59.211 --> 13:00.346
to draw Prince Eric.

13:00.346 --> 13:04.550
Right. Because of that, you live in a bubble

13:04.550 --> 13:06.118
where people do what you want

13:06.118 --> 13:07.653
and tell you what you wanna hear.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.155
Oh, I don't think that's true.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.890
Drew, I'm going to tell you
this for your own good...

13:10.890 --> 13:13.325
you can't put Gatorade on salmon.

13:13.325 --> 13:14.693
Oh, yes, you can.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.128
The hot Italian lady from
the Food Network told me so.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.397
Did she say it on TV?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.732
No, she said it to me

13:19.732 --> 13:22.134
when she jumped escalators to try to talk...

13:22.134 --> 13:23.567
Oh.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.739
Well, I don't wanna live that way.

13:26.739 --> 13:27.907
I don't want you to treat me that way.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.308
Are you sure?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.910
Yeah, Liz, I'm an adult.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.276
You can be honest with me.
I can take it.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.389
That's game. Your serve.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.289
That's it! I quit!

13:46.392 --> 13:48.121
This racket is a fart and you cheat!

13:49.361 --> 13:50.350
You're a cheating bitch!

13:55.601 --> 13:59.071
Kenneth, I need your help.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.372
You know Tracy quite well

14:00.372 --> 14:01.707
wouldn't you say?

14:01.707 --> 14:03.142
Oh, I know Mr. Jordan

14:03.142 --> 14:05.277
Iike the back of my stepfather Ron's hand.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.279
I know all his A.T.M. P.I.N. codes.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.281
I know when he's cranky
and needs his binky.

14:09.281 --> 14:10.583
I know that by "binky"

14:10.583 --> 14:12.585
he means 1 970s pornography.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.054
So how is he functioning without you?

14:15.054 --> 14:17.289
Oh, I'm still doing everything for him.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.291
Uh, tonight I have to ride
my bike over to his house

14:19.291 --> 14:21.627
in New Jersey to hold his hand during Lost.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.356
That's it!
Kenneth, don't you see?

14:24.563 --> 14:25.564
You're our ace in the hole.

14:25.564 --> 14:26.599
How dare you!

14:26.599 --> 14:28.334
You're what I've been looking for

14:28.334 --> 14:31.270
the one thing at T.G.S. that
Tracy cannot live without.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.972
Now, Kenneth, I need you

14:32.972 --> 14:35.040
to cut Tracy off completely.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.209
Oh, I don't know if I could do that.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.410
You want him to come back,
don't you?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.612
This is the only way.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.915
Don't answer that.
It could be Tracy.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.017
But I have to answer the phones.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.075
That's my job.

14:50.456 --> 14:53.292
Hello, Studio 6-H.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.328
This is... Cranston.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.864
Oh, hey, Cranston.
I was looking for Kenneth.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.733
He's not here.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.567
But I'm sure wherever he is,
he loves you very much.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.180
Liz, you seem really stressed out.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.615
Do you wanna talk
about what's going on?

15:16.615 --> 15:18.550
I just hope it's not a mistake.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.353
Well, maybe it is, but you have
to listen to your heart.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.856
Yeah, but, why meddle with
something that was great?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.858
Oh, Liz. It'll grow back.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.026
What?

15:27.026 --> 15:28.186
We're talking about my hair, right?

15:31.430 --> 15:35.834
# Fat-necked girl,
let me count your neck rings?

15:35.834 --> 15:38.971
I'm thirsty!

15:38.971 --> 15:43.101
Family? Who's in charge of my thirst?

15:48.280 --> 15:52.217
Cranston, why hasn't Kenneth
called me back yet?

15:52.217 --> 15:54.987
I miss him!

15:54.987 --> 15:59.048
Cranston... why are you crying?

16:00.559 --> 16:02.728
This is too hard, Mr. Donaghy.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.531
I cannot stand by while
Mr. Jordan dies of dehydration

16:05.531 --> 16:07.123
in his recording studio.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.036
Plus, I've started to dream as Cranston.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.405
Kenneth, the more desperate
Tracy becomes

16:13.405 --> 16:14.740
the more our plan is working.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.542
The next thing he'll do
is show up here.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.344
He'll demand you go
with him, you say no.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.679
Stay strong and he'll cave.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.114
Trust me.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.415
I hope you're right, Mr. Donaghy

16:23.415 --> 16:26.318
because you're playing with people's lives here.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.946
Don't you think I know that?

16:30.923 --> 16:33.726
We are back with sketch comedian,
Jenna Maroney.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.627
Thank you, Meredith. But, please...

16:35.627 --> 16:36.729
I'm not a hero.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.163
I'm just trying to
raise awareness that

16:38.163 --> 16:41.000
I'm more than just "that hot
chick on Tracy Jordan's show."

16:41.000 --> 16:42.668
So, this is for Locks of Love?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.069
Oh, no, Locks of Love turned me down.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.204
They said my hair was

16:45.204 --> 16:46.271
too processed for a sick person to wear.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.773
But this is for
a wonderful charity

16:47.773 --> 16:49.742
called Merkins of Hope.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.578
Okay, uh, let's make the big cut.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.114
So what about that crazy news

16:55.114 --> 16:56.115
that Tracy Jordan has quit T.G.S.?

16:56.115 --> 16:58.283
What?

16:58.283 --> 17:00.853
Oh, yeah. Word is he quit
over a contract dispute.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.155
Guess you're the only
star left on that show!

17:03.155 --> 17:04.390
No! No, stop!
Stop cutting my hair!

17:04.390 --> 17:05.391
I don't need this anymore!

17:05.391 --> 17:06.892
Ugh!

17:06.892 --> 17:08.260
Oh, my God!

17:08.260 --> 17:10.558
It's okay, it's okay.
I can fix this!

17:13.031 --> 17:15.367
Jack, is Tracy still not here?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.435
We have three hours before the show!

17:17.435 --> 17:19.805
Security told me that he's
in the building, Pete.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.441
So it's working.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.242
Now it's all up to Kenneth Ellen Parcell.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.111
Hey, Ken.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.713
I've been calling you.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.648
Has Cranston not been
giving you my messages?

17:29.648 --> 17:32.251
No, he told me.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.653
Yeah, well, don't worry.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.255
I just came to get a few of my things.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.519
And I won't bother you.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.798
All right, I guess that's everything.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.468
But I want you to know,
if I walk out that door

17:49.468 --> 17:50.969
Ken, I'm not gonna call again.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.938
It's over.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.405
You understand?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.244
I can't do this!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.905
I'm sorry, Mr. Donaghy, but I can't.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.717
Mr. Donaghy wanted me
to stop talking to you

18:05.717 --> 18:07.119
so you'd come back.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.621
So you used Cranston as his gatekeeper!

18:09.621 --> 18:11.824
I'm very disappointed,
Kenneth.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.358
I know, I blew it.

18:13.358 --> 18:16.762
I guess I'm only farm-strong,
and not heart-strong.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.896
Fine. Go and help him.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.264
I shouldn't have tried to manipulate

18:19.264 --> 18:20.265
the two of you that way.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.800
But I will need you

18:21.800 --> 18:23.168
to turn in your page jacket.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.671
What?

18:25.671 --> 18:27.773
Well, your main duty was
taking care of Tracy.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.604
Tracy no longer works here.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.444
Therefore, your services
are no longer required.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.502
As a page?

18:34.379 --> 18:36.215
Oh, no...

18:36.215 --> 18:37.716
Wait a minute, you want
to fire my boy, Ken?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.384
Stay out of this, Tracy.
It's not your concern.

18:39.384 --> 18:40.385
Unless?

18:40.385 --> 18:41.753
Unless what?

18:41.753 --> 18:44.456
You say Kenneth can't work here
because I don't work here.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.624
But if I work here

18:45.624 --> 18:47.126
so can Kenneth.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.827
I don't understand.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.562
Of course you don't, you idiot.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.364
I'm coming back to work, Jack...

18:52.364 --> 18:54.199
with Kenneth.

18:54.199 --> 18:55.567
Damn you and your meddling.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.369
I'll be in my dressing room.

18:57.369 --> 18:58.802
That a boy, Tray.
Come on.

19:00.372 --> 19:04.001
I've got to get back into that bubble.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.420
Sir, you are pulling that look off.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.922
Look, I wanted to apologize
for my behavior

19:16.922 --> 19:18.190
the other day on the tennis court.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.925
That is not who I am.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.226
But you made me feel like a loser.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.488
'Cause you lost.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.264
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have
done that to you.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.566
But... you have so much potential.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.368
But I'm happy this way.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.203
I didn't like it outside
the bubble, Liz.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.539
It was very ironic.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.708
No, it wasn't. That's not
how you use that word...

19:36.708 --> 19:38.877
No, stop it. I want to use
"ironic" however I want.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.580
I want to stay in the bubble, Liz.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.549
And I want you in there with me.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.218
Come on.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.549
Come away with me.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.389
We can go upstate on my new motorcycle.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.517
Oh, boy, Drew.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.729
I don't think this is going to work.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.965
Okay.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.399
I guess I'll see you around then.

20:03.902 --> 20:07.272
Or as the French say...

20:07.272 --> 20:11.003
Yeah. I'll see you around.
