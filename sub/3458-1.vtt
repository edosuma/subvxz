01:22.432 --> 01:24.523
Fear...

01:29.966 --> 01:33.074
<i>Fear...</i>

02:09.102 --> 02:10.298
Get down on the ground!

02:10.398 --> 02:12.780
- Where am I?
- Get down on the ground now!

03:24.307 --> 03:25.533
Over here!

03:47.107 --> 03:50.595
Help... help me.

03:58.577 --> 04:03.108
<i>For centuries, mankind
has always been divided...</i>

04:03.304 --> 04:05.589
<i>The rich from the poor
The strong from the weak</i>

04:05.712 --> 04:08.851
<i>The predator and the prey.</i>

04:09.211 --> 04:13.122
<i>The world as we know it today
hasn't changed much.</i>

04:13.212 --> 04:16.709
<i>Tekken City.
We're we stand proud.</i>

04:16.777 --> 04:21.411
<i>Mankind symbol, and proof of our </i>

04:21.879 --> 04:27.187
<i>Those who are weak were banished
beyond the walls of Tekken City.</i>

04:27.213 --> 04:31.894
<i>Many of them set up slum, build their own camp they call "home".</i>

04:49.181 --> 04:51.217
Rise and shine.

04:57.616 --> 04:59.150
Have a nice nap?

05:07.783 --> 05:09.586
You.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.560
Is he an angel ?

05:22.917 --> 05:24.224
Are you an angel ?

05:25.911 --> 05:27.988
Who the hell are you?

05:29.648 --> 05:33.459
We have been told to
welcome strangers...

05:33.518 --> 05:39.054
as you never know when they
might be an angel in disguise.

05:39.151 --> 05:41.686
Am I right?

05:42.914 --> 05:44.093
So, tell us.

05:44.186 --> 05:46.562
Are you one?

05:51.539 --> 05:54.322
They call me The Minister.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.456
Those people like to
confess things to me.

06:03.721 --> 06:06.165
See all these people?

06:06.254 --> 06:09.461
All these sinners?

06:09.554 --> 06:11.735
They work for me.

06:12.055 --> 06:13.198
You will too.

06:13.288 --> 06:15.562
I don't think so.

06:17.121 --> 06:18.928
I know so.

06:19.555 --> 06:24.392
"By the sweat of your brow
shall you labor

06:24.489 --> 06:27.160
until you return to
the ground."

06:31.656 --> 06:33.734
You're crazy.

06:38.057 --> 06:40.433
At the End of Days,

06:40.947 --> 06:44.815
many will be excluded from
the Book of Life.

06:47.323 --> 06:52.265
The first to be consumed by
fire and brimstone

06:52.891 --> 06:55.092
will be the cowards.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.235
Tell me...

07:03.625 --> 07:04.898
Are you a coward?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.598
Why don't you cut me
loose and find out?

07:09.225 --> 07:11.848
See this device there, huh?

07:15.481 --> 07:21.397
We put a tiny little bomb
inside you... here.

07:24.894 --> 07:26.731
When I push this button...

07:26.777 --> 07:28.768
What did you do to me?

07:29.461 --> 07:30.902
You see, yes?

07:30.994 --> 07:35.710
And, and you get a one-way ticket
to see our Heavenly Father.

07:35.761 --> 07:36.959
What?

07:39.195 --> 07:41.729
Not a man of faith.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.738
Okay, then...

07:43.829 --> 07:46.065
I'll give you a demonstration.

07:46.629 --> 07:49.539
Look at this man there,
this one.

08:02.863 --> 08:05.728
I had issues with him.

08:06.897 --> 08:08.637
My own little recipe.

08:08.731 --> 08:14.600
As long as you do as you are
told, you'll be fine.

08:14.964 --> 08:17.354
Why me?

08:17.564 --> 08:19.133
Who am I?

08:19.231 --> 08:22.402
You forgot your name?

08:22.498 --> 08:23.237
Amnesia?

08:23.331 --> 08:25.331
A blow to the head perhaps?

08:25.431 --> 08:28.069
Well, if you don't
know your name,

08:28.166 --> 08:31.939
I guess we gotta give you one.

08:32.032 --> 08:34.443
Where are we in the alphabet?

08:34.644 --> 08:35.971
I think we're at "H"

08:36.065 --> 08:37.972
It's "J...

08:38.166 --> 08:39.303
It's "K"...

08:39.399 --> 08:41.602
"K"..,..

08:41.700 --> 08:43.472
Excellent.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.635
You will be K.

08:45.933 --> 08:47.843
What do you want from me?

08:47.933 --> 08:50.537
You'll find out soon enough.

08:50.634 --> 08:51.737
Mark him.

09:01.134 --> 09:03.738
Look at me.

09:06.802 --> 09:08.552
Don't move.

09:33.910 --> 09:35.800
<i>Rise and awaken,</i>

09:35.804 --> 09:39.544
<i>fellow believers and devotees.</i>

09:41.280 --> 09:46.199
<i>It is I, The Minister and
leader of your district.</i>

09:48.305 --> 09:50.010
<i>The dawn of a new day comes</i>

09:50.105 --> 09:52.310
<i>as we must continue to
defend ourselves</i>

09:52.405 --> 09:55.975
<i>against the sinners of
the outside world.</i>

10:04.318 --> 10:06.615
<i>Our enemies must not win,</i>

10:06.706 --> 10:11.117
<i>or we shall face
extermination in our district.</i>

10:18.274 --> 10:22.582
<i>We must work hard and
protect each other.</i>

10:22.674 --> 10:27.994
<i>We must train hard and be
killers to defend the world.</i>

10:30.275 --> 10:34.243
<i>For is it not! who can only
promise you security?</i>

10:34.341 --> 10:37.876
<i>Is it not I who put a
roof on your heads..,..</i>

10:37.975 --> 10:41.419
<i>feed you, nurture you ?</i>

10:45.476 --> 10:48.873
<i>We are the hand of God.</i>

10:50.676 --> 10:55.082
<i>Incorruptible, unstoppable.</i>

11:57.576 --> 11:59.325
<i>The Minister speaking.</i>

11:59.739 --> 12:01.406
My friends..,..

12:02.736 --> 12:06.666
My warriors, my sinners..,..

12:06.816 --> 12:08.334
<i>my kids...</i>

12:09.916 --> 12:12.224
<i>Peace comes at a price,</i>

12:12.316 --> 12:16.090
and for the privilege, you
will learn to kill,

12:16.184 --> 12:20.492
<i>so that you may rid the
violence of the sinners.</i>

12:20.584 --> 12:24.323
For their own benefit and
greedy ways...

12:25.322 --> 12:29.321
<i>when they are on the outsides.</i>

12:29.417 --> 12:34.566
<i>We will not rest until justice
has been served, believe me.</i>

12:35.485 --> 12:37.019
Hi, handsome.

12:50.953 --> 12:54.442
<i>There is a time to
change this world.</i>

12:54.519 --> 12:56.189
<i>We will do this.</i>

12:59.886 --> 13:01.969
<i>I believe in you.
You're my first...</i>

13:02.069 --> 13:05.692
<i>My children, my warriors.</i>

13:31.156 --> 13:32.663
Good luck.

14:53.396 --> 14:55.013
Now finish them.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.840
I'm not a murderer.

14:58.639 --> 15:00.419
How do you know?

15:08.179 --> 15:11.438
You need to learn how
things work.

15:11.530 --> 15:14.872
In here, you make mistake,
you die.

15:19.131 --> 15:21.609
Just like in real life
on the street.

15:25.665 --> 15:28.337
Do you understand?

15:30.432 --> 15:31.841
Let's go.

16:28.003 --> 16:30.026
What is this place?

16:30.603 --> 16:32.877
To some, it is home.

16:32.970 --> 16:35.005
To many, it is a prison.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.742
You can make it whatever
you want it to be.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.441
<i>You disgraced me...</i>

17:15.540 --> 17:17.779
<i>You...</i>

17:44.275 --> 17:46.617
<i>Do not let your emotions
get in your...</i>

17:46.709 --> 17:48.687
<i>Your heart is weak...</i>

17:50.876 --> 17:53.678
<i>Pain is nothing...</i>

17:53.776 --> 17:56.555
<i>You have disgraced me...</i>

17:56.644 --> 17:57.947
<i>Dishonored...</i>

18:07.811 --> 18:10.448
Mmm...

18:18.068 --> 18:19.514
Let's go.

18:34.933 --> 18:36.291
I don't like guns.

18:36.379 --> 18:38.755
Yeah... we need to find out
whether you can shoot or not.

18:51.814 --> 18:54.259
I don't like guns.

19:02.148 --> 19:03.922
So, where did you learn to
shoot like that?

19:04.216 --> 19:05.883
I don't remember.

19:06.082 --> 19:09.566
Yeah, sometimes it's best
to forget the past.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.355
Might help.

20:50.490 --> 20:52.559
You have definitely
done this before.

20:59.409 --> 21:01.339
Not much of a talker, are you?

21:02.758 --> 21:05.759
Not much to talk about when
you don't remember anything.

21:09.312 --> 21:10.841
Who is she?

21:11.725 --> 21:13.725
That is Rhona Anders.

21:13.825 --> 21:15.962
Her father was assassinated.

21:16.059 --> 21:18.731
He taught both the girls
everything he knew.

21:18.826 --> 21:21.394
There's two of 'em.

21:21.492 --> 21:25.698
Rumor has it that the sister
sold Rhona to The Minister.

21:28.193 --> 21:29.637
Some family.

21:32.227 --> 21:34.172
You don't remember yours,
do you?

21:38.027 --> 21:40.801
I will never forget mine.

21:40.894 --> 21:44.338
My son did this to me.

21:44.428 --> 21:49.100
The same night he
killed my wife.

21:51.555 --> 21:54.870
He went into hiding
for three years.

21:56.929 --> 22:01.032
But I found him here.

22:01.129 --> 22:03.902
He was one of those guys.

22:03.996 --> 22:06.906
What happened to him?

22:09.159 --> 22:11.205
Justice.

22:12.764 --> 22:16.397
The Minister... he gave me justice.

22:19.849 --> 22:22.207
Minister, Minister,
look what I made.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.987
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
bother you anymore.

22:36.668 --> 22:38.184
It's okay.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.235
Thank you.

22:41.435 --> 22:43.342
For what?

22:43.433 --> 22:44.567
Thank you.

22:57.914 --> 22:59.528
You there!

23:01.068 --> 23:02.476
Next.

26:07.682 --> 26:09.125
Death match.

26:09.215 --> 26:12.036
You win, you take his life.

26:24.866 --> 26:26.887
You have a choice.

26:26.984 --> 26:28.257
Finish your opponent...

26:28.351 --> 26:31.563
or kill another in his place.

26:39.885 --> 26:41.698
Come on, kill him.

26:42.718 --> 26:44.128
And I let you go free.

26:56.796 --> 26:58.187
No.

26:58.987 --> 27:01.394
Let the janitor go.

27:19.321 --> 27:20.799
He's ready.

27:47.756 --> 27:50.894
<i>Emotions...</i>

27:50.990 --> 27:52.493
<i>Fear...</i>

27:55.124 --> 27:57.363
<i>Do not let your emotions
get in the way.</i>

28:01.991 --> 28:03.183
Hey... hey.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.381
Hei.

28:07.481 --> 28:08.792
Thank you.

28:10.925 --> 28:12.397
Thank you.

28:14.058 --> 28:16.231
You gonna be okay?

28:17.025 --> 28:19.054
This is where I belong.

28:19.592 --> 28:21.206
I'll be okay.

28:23.326 --> 28:26.167
That Anders is a good person.

28:27.443 --> 28:29.636
Maybe one of the best here.

28:32.927 --> 28:34.436
Get some rest now.

28:34.627 --> 28:36.196
You have to leave early
in the morning.

28:51.695 --> 28:53.968
What?

28:54.061 --> 28:57.528
No, we are not doing this.

28:57.629 --> 28:58.936
I say no!

28:59.029 --> 29:04.406
Listen, I'm speaking to you
from the place my father built.

29:04.496 --> 29:09.463
Yeah... unfortunately bad
people put him out of business.

29:09.563 --> 29:14.508
But this place fed many
families, many children.

29:14.596 --> 29:16.767
Children were very
important to my father

29:16.863 --> 29:19.205
Children not only.

29:19.297 --> 29:22.434
No-- I said no!

29:22.530 --> 29:26.633
Even you double your amount, we
don't kill children.

29:26.731 --> 29:31.073
But if you triple it...
then we have a deal.

30:49.319 --> 30:51.746
So, why are you
doing all this?

30:51.838 --> 30:53.577
We've all got our reasons.

30:53.671 --> 30:55.979
So what's yours?

30:56.071 --> 30:58.174
A long time ago,

30:58.272 --> 31:00.944
over one billion people
believed in Allah,

31:01.038 --> 31:03.243
over two billion in
Jesus Christ,

31:03.338 --> 31:06.112
and a few in L. Ron Hubbard.

31:07.089 --> 31:09.377
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.141
You can hate me all you want,

31:27.240 --> 31:29.804
but right now you'll be glad
we're on the same team.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.935
This place belongs to
Dragon Eyes.

31:36.608 --> 31:39.552
He's over there right now
having his daily tea.

31:40.763 --> 31:42.415
I'm just supposed to walk in
there and kill him?

31:42.508 --> 31:44.829
No, I thought I'd bring you here
just to get to know you better.

31:48.185 --> 31:50.743
Apart from the death and
drugs he deals in,

31:51.042 --> 31:52.965
his favorite hobby is
young girls.

31:54.175 --> 31:56.314
Eight years old is the
youngest we know of.

32:07.210 --> 32:08.586
The janitor.

32:09.738 --> 32:12.482
If you hurt him, I'll
kill you all.

32:24.678 --> 32:25.826
Hei

33:06.415 --> 33:07.986
Wait here.

33:28.950 --> 33:30.171
Are you K?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.605
Come with me.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.164
This is the common area.

33:42.264 --> 33:44.590
You share with the
other tenants.

33:47.385 --> 33:50.850
No drinking alcohol and no
cooking smelly things.

33:54.352 --> 33:56.352
We have an Internet.

33:58.319 --> 33:59.819
And this is your neighbor.

34:05.986 --> 34:08.396
You'll get used to the noise.

34:52.223 --> 34:55.860
<i>Do you remember my voice?</i>

34:55.956 --> 34:58.265
<i>Disgrace me...</i>

34:58.357 --> 35:02.229
<i>You will never be a
true warrior...</i>

35:04.590 --> 35:07.490
<i>Your heart is weak...</i>

36:53.066 --> 36:54.203
Stop it.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.573
Leave me alone.

36:55.667 --> 36:58.077
You're the one who
complained about the noise.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.167
It wasn't me.

36:59.266 --> 37:00.710
No, it wasn't you, eh?

37:00.800 --> 37:02.073
- No.
- Luckily for you..,..

37:03.235 --> 37:05.375
I like pretty things.

37:05.467 --> 37:06.673
Don't, that was my mother's.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.041
- Oh, your mama's, eh?
- Stop !

37:09.334 --> 37:11.965
No, don't... don't.

37:12.165 --> 37:14.306
Look at me, look at me.

37:14.401 --> 37:15.141
Hei.

37:15.235 --> 37:16.405
Leave her alone.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.860
And who are you?

37:21.435 --> 37:23.044
Nobody wants any trouble.

37:23.061 --> 37:25.212
Yeah? Well, you should
think about that

37:25.216 --> 37:28.242
before you get involved in
other people's business!

37:41.437 --> 37:43.120
Let's get out of here.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.812
That was really cool of you.

37:58.338 --> 38:00.298
They won't bother you again.

38:01.872 --> 38:03.411
Thank you.

40:09.442 --> 40:10.731
<i>Weak...</i>

40:13.431 --> 40:15.632
<i>Pain...</i>

40:29.275 --> 40:31.718
<i>Fear..,..</i>

42:53.633 --> 42:55.644
You take your time.

42:57.286 --> 42:59.152
We've got a job tonight.

42:59.362 --> 43:01.636
Target's name is
Shikedo Hitomi.

43:01.729 --> 43:04.880
He's got his hands in everything
in the eastern seaport.

43:05.162 --> 43:07.902
There's a club, the Fox
Gentlemen's Club.

43:07.996 --> 43:10.564
He's a regular there.

43:10.862 --> 43:12.101
Don't mess it up.

44:55.477 --> 44:56.731
Hei

46:19.786 --> 46:21.473
I want out.

46:23.078 --> 46:25.611
Do you think you're
the first to try?

46:27.013 --> 46:29.518
The only way out's
in a body bag.

46:38.112 --> 46:39.021
Hei.

46:39.112 --> 46:40.678
Hi.

46:41.413 --> 46:45.447
I just wanted to thank you for
saving my life the other day.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.467
Uh, it's okay.

46:47.553 --> 46:50.582
Are you hungry?
I can make you something to eat.

46:50.913 --> 46:53.043
No, I, I'm fine right now.

46:54.197 --> 46:56.251
Thanks-- thanks again.

46:56.547 --> 46:58.068
See you.

47:06.381 --> 47:08.018
Your girlfriend?

47:08.810 --> 47:10.746
Just a neighbor.

47:12.558 --> 47:14.758
I wouldn't get too attached.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.988
Can I change my mind?

48:22.087 --> 48:25.101
It's just spaghetti and
tomato sauce.

48:27.620 --> 48:30.404
It's not a lot but it's the
least I could do.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.469
So... you just moved in, huh?

48:36.884 --> 48:39.712
I mean, we haven't had
anyone new in a while.

48:40.989 --> 48:42.165
Uh...

48:42.256 --> 48:45.257
Aside from the noise, you can't
really beat the price.

48:45.656 --> 48:47.576
Yeah, it's okay.

48:48.322 --> 48:50.391
Yeah, um...

48:52.946 --> 48:57.332
Uh, I see you... going in and
out, like, at strange times.

48:57.423 --> 48:58.991
What is it that you do exactly?

49:01.223 --> 49:05.759
Um... sort of a little bit of
this, a little bit of that.

49:06.057 --> 49:07.762
You know, whatever I can find.

49:07.957 --> 49:09.526
Oh.

49:12.992 --> 49:16.453
Um... I work at a free clinic.

49:17.691 --> 49:23.333
It, it's not much but... it
makes ends meet... I guess.

49:27.795 --> 49:30.774
Um... so, I forgot to ask you,
what's your name?

49:33.993 --> 49:35.174
So?

49:36.693 --> 49:37.755
What?

49:37.760 --> 49:38.703
Your name, silly.

49:38.794 --> 49:40.100
I asked you what your name is.

49:43.322 --> 49:44.860
Um... people call me K.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.131
Is that short for something?

49:48.638 --> 49:50.228
No, it's just K.

49:50.327 --> 49:52.771
Hmm... cool.

49:56.461 --> 49:58.030
Oh, my God.

49:58.528 --> 49:59.825
Shit.

50:08.780 --> 50:10.221
What happened?

50:10.462 --> 50:11.804
It's nothing.

50:11.896 --> 50:13.834
One of those guys
just got lucky.

50:13.863 --> 50:15.102
What, from the other day?

50:34.797 --> 50:36.104
That's much better.

50:36.198 --> 50:37.369
I'm glad I could help.

50:37.773 --> 50:39.669
Dinner didn't seem like enough.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.344
Maybe we can do it
again sometime.

50:44.899 --> 50:46.604
Yeah, I would like that.

51:01.400 --> 51:05.936
<i>I dreamed a dream that the
whole world sings</i>

51:06.033 --> 51:11.842
I dreamed a dream that the
whole world sings

51:16.167 --> 51:19.338
<i>You carry your family name.</i>

51:19.434 --> 51:21.054
<i>Fight with honor!</i>

51:21.967 --> 51:24.044
<i>Face your demons.</i>

52:05.260 --> 52:06.921
<i>Demons...</i>

52:12.449 --> 52:13.800
<i>Warrior..,..</i>

52:18.712 --> 52:20.123
<i>Fight !</i>

52:22.977 --> 52:24.851
<i>Your heart is weak!</i>

52:27.891 --> 52:29.720
<i>Pain...</i>

52:30.506 --> 52:33.105
<i>Do you remember my voice?</i>

52:34.641 --> 52:36.039
<i>Emotion...</i>

52:38.174 --> 52:41.799
<i>You cannot control your mind!</i>

54:01.847 --> 54:03.355
You !

54:04.147 --> 54:05.550
I thought you were dead!

54:05.748 --> 54:07.024
Do you know who I am?

54:07.114 --> 54:09.408
We're still repairing the
damage you have done!

54:09.948 --> 54:12.586
Do you have any records from
when I checked in?

54:12.681 --> 54:15.387
Address, phone numbers,
anything.

54:20.149 --> 54:21.849
I only have your initials.

54:21.949 --> 54:23.294
"K.M."

54:23.949 --> 54:25.440
You paid cash.

54:25.444 --> 54:28.373
Do you remember if I was
alone or with somebody?

54:28.916 --> 54:30.325
No.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.655
Are you sure?

54:31.750 --> 54:32.784
Mm-hmm.

54:36.816 --> 54:38.637
Thank you.

54:55.525 --> 54:56.796
We're on.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.859
Who is it this time?

55:06.419 --> 55:08.520
So, what's his crime
against humanity?

55:09.653 --> 55:10.989
I don't know.

55:12.219 --> 55:13.629
The Minister wants him dead.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.551
That's good enough for me.

55:29.303 --> 55:31.509
<i>I've walked by this place
five times already.</i>

55:31.511 --> 55:33.139
<i>Then make it six.</i>

55:33.821 --> 55:34.798
I see him.

55:34.888 --> 55:36.025
Stay on him.

56:25.192 --> 56:26.693
Damn it.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.957
Who are you?

56:47.770 --> 56:49.165
Who are you?

56:50.535 --> 56:52.185
You don't know who I am?

56:53.080 --> 56:54.957
And yet you're
ready to kill me?

57:13.015 --> 57:14.692
Be smart, boy.

57:15.663 --> 57:16.907
Walk away.

57:17.662 --> 57:18.890
I can't.

57:20.346 --> 57:21.941
Sure you can.

57:22.219 --> 57:23.673
I did.

57:48.898 --> 57:50.883
This isn't what it seems.

57:51.432 --> 57:53.038
I'll see you again.

58:30.435 --> 58:32.079
What are you gonna do, kill me?

58:34.269 --> 58:35.971
You screwed up the mission.

58:36.103 --> 58:37.992
You put us both at risk.

58:38.169 --> 58:39.850
I made a judgment call.

58:39.902 --> 58:42.305
You don't make the call,
I do.

58:42.503 --> 58:44.071
He had The Minister's mark.

58:44.169 --> 58:45.511
He's one of us.

58:45.603 --> 58:47.979
he was one of us.

58:48.070 --> 58:50.254
Now he's a traitor
and a target.

58:50.286 --> 58:52.309
Don't you question The
Minister's motives sometimes?

58:52.404 --> 58:53.609
No, I don't.

58:53.704 --> 58:55.943
Don't you think he
talks a good game

58:56.037 --> 58:57.379
but something's not right?

58:57.470 --> 58:59.781
I know you want your freedom
as much as I do.

58:59.881 --> 59:01.543
He got out.

59:01.737 --> 59:03.038
You wanna go rogue?

59:03.438 --> 59:05.647
And have every single one of
The Minister's killers.

59:05.737 --> 59:07.658
Trying to hunt you down?

59:07.971 --> 59:09.481
That's not my idea of freedom.

59:09.671 --> 59:11.275
He can't just kill everyone.

59:11.305 --> 59:12.914
Yes, he can.

59:14.105 --> 59:15.639
K?

59:21.472 --> 59:23.043
It's just Laura.

59:25.539 --> 59:27.007
She's a potential threat.

59:29.306 --> 59:30.666
Stop---

59:32.340 --> 59:33.884
We can fix this.

59:34.106 --> 59:35.358
What do you propose?

59:35.740 --> 59:37.425
The Minister can't lose both of us

59:37.428 --> 59:38.884
over one botched mission.

59:38.971 --> 59:41.086
Talk to him, buy us some time.

59:42.107 --> 59:43.790
We'll find the target.

59:46.725 --> 59:48.055
I'll try.

59:53.652 --> 59:55.603
Don't screw it up.

01:00:02.609 --> 01:00:04.054
K ?

01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:07.819
Hey.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.346
Hei.

01:00:10.243 --> 01:00:11.470
Uh, how is everything?

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:12.749
How are your stitches?

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.555
They're good.

01:00:14.628 --> 01:00:16.421
You did a good job, thank you.

01:00:16.677 --> 01:00:17.984
No problem.

01:00:21.329 --> 01:00:23.021
Um... you're good at
patching people up.

01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:25.434
Have you ever done
the opposite?

01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:26.751
Opposite?

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:28.215
What do you mean?

01:00:28.946 --> 01:00:31.163
I need something taken out.

01:01:02.581 --> 01:01:05.525
Okay, I think I
can get it out.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.866
Fight with honor...

01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:44.435
<i>Pain is nothing...</i>

01:01:49.884 --> 01:01:51.931
<i>Fear...</i>

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:55.022
<i>Fight with honor...</i>

01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:00.491
<i>Pain is...</i>

01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:07.023
Got to get the blood flowing.

01:02:07.118 --> 01:02:09.426
No, no, no, no, you should rest.

01:02:10.453 --> 01:02:12.007
Relax.

01:02:13.736 --> 01:02:15.796
Here.

01:02:43.922 --> 01:02:45.414
- Hey.
- Hai.

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:51.170
How you feeling?

01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:53.464
Better.

01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:54.660
Thanks.

01:02:54.756 --> 01:02:56.281
Looking much better.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:16.422
I'm, I'm sorry.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:07.261
<i>Wakey, wakey!</i>

01:04:08.728 --> 01:04:10.781
<i>Ohayou gozaimasu, K-san.</i>

01:04:20.229 --> 01:04:22.614
<i>Closing the windows won't help.</i>

01:04:22.814 --> 01:04:24.759
<i>I can still see you.</i>

01:04:32.597 --> 01:04:34.441
<i>You shouldn't do that.</i>

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.872
<i>I think you might want to hear what! have to say.</i>

01:04:37.492 --> 01:04:42.805
<i>Radio waves, electricity,
UHF channels--</i>

01:04:43.596 --> 01:04:45.774
<i>they're all so easy
to hack into.</i>

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:48.389
<i>What are you gonna do now,
smash your phone?</i>

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:50.407
Who are you?

01:04:50.498 --> 01:04:52.705
<i>I'm the one that got away.</i>

01:04:53.766 --> 01:04:54.966
Fury.

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.543
I'm flattered.

01:04:56.632 --> 01:04:58.200
You remembered my name.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.865
<i>Now, listen to me closely.</i>

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.732
The Minister is not the
righteous man he claims to be.

01:05:05.331 --> 01:05:07.502
<i>He sells his services on
the black market.</i>

01:05:08.084 --> 01:05:10.373
The sleaziest
clientele imaginable.

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:12.495
Why should I believe you?

01:05:12.499 --> 01:05:13.539
<i>Trust me.</i>

01:05:13.633 --> 01:05:15.267
<i>I'm your only friend.</i>

01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:17.208
And I'm not your friend.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.337
Look at this.

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:28.642
<i>You've pissed him off.</i>

01:05:29.042 --> 01:05:32.951
<i>Now he's gonna come at you hard
and fast until he gets you.</i>

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.685
Your only chance at freedom
is to strike first.

01:05:38.346 --> 01:05:40.278
<i>If I was you, I'd get yourself
and that pretty little girl</i>

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:42.041
<i>out of there right away.</i>

01:05:46.669 --> 01:05:48.082
Wait.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.166
Wait, I have questions.

01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:57.234
Is that The Minister?

01:05:57.434 --> 01:05:58.745
No.

01:05:58.837 --> 01:06:00.430
The Minister has other ways
of getting to me.

01:06:00.437 --> 01:06:02.163
This isn't him.

01:06:27.076 --> 01:06:28.145
I gotta get going..,..

01:06:28.148 --> 01:06:29.081
Wait.

01:06:29.473 --> 01:06:32.883
Don't go, please-- you're
gonna get killed.

01:06:32.973 --> 01:06:34.974
If she wanted me dead, she
wouldn't have warned me.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.244
It could be a trap.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.743
Don't go, please.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.113
Let's just get out of here.

01:06:39.207 --> 01:06:41.684
You and me, right now.

01:06:41.774 --> 01:06:43.116
Please.

01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:48.652
When I get back, we'll leave
together, I promise.

01:07:16.792 --> 01:07:18.554
I didn't think you'd come.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.750
I'm here.

01:07:20.843 --> 01:07:22.285
The Minister's livid.

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.317
The only way I was able to convince him
not to blow your head off..,..

01:07:25.511 --> 01:07:27.455
was to agree to do
the job myself.

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.038
I took it out.

01:07:31.844 --> 01:07:33.516
There's no explosive.

01:07:38.478 --> 01:07:40.047
Then why are you here?

01:07:40.385 --> 01:07:42.211
Because I want answers.

01:07:46.136 --> 01:07:47.446
And I believe.

01:07:48.032 --> 01:07:49.285
In the cause?

01:07:49.379 --> 01:07:52.118
No.

01:07:52.212 --> 01:07:53.838
In you.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.205
I don't know who I am.

01:07:59.946 --> 01:08:01.890
But I know what I'm
doing is right.

01:08:02.636 --> 01:08:04.284
So do you.

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:08.220
You could have killed me
multiple times.

01:08:09.095 --> 01:08:10.777
But you didn't.

01:08:11.847 --> 01:08:12.955
You risked your life

01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:15.130
when you didn't take the
shot at me and Fury

01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:17.353
when you got the chance.

01:08:18.247 --> 01:08:19.816
'Cause you're a good person.

01:08:22.782 --> 01:08:24.513
You just don't know it.

01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:49.294
It's been a while.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:52.542
Glad to see you're doing well.

01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:53.790
Screw you.

01:08:58.694 --> 01:09:00.232
I deserve that.

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:05.273
Here-- take a look at this.

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:21.062
How do I know this isn't fake?

01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:23.225
It's a fair question.

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:24.761
But a better one...

01:09:24.853 --> 01:09:27.158
is do you think it's fake?

01:09:30.548 --> 01:09:32.282
We've all been played.

01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:37.112
Not like I have.

01:09:38.263 --> 01:09:40.064
Let the games begin.

01:09:57.223 --> 01:09:58.632
He's gonna kill you.

01:10:03.522 --> 01:10:05.037
- What do you want?

01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:33.148
That was my last confession.

01:10:39.982 --> 01:10:41.398
Let's go.

01:10:59.442 --> 01:11:01.033
Laura...

01:11:04.807 --> 01:11:06.397
Told you not to get attached.

01:11:07.194 --> 01:11:08.897
It's too late for that.

01:11:10.261 --> 01:11:11.939
I'm going after her.

01:11:13.625 --> 01:11:15.140
They'll be waiting for us.

01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:17.711
You don't have to go.

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:20.216
I know.

01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:24.165
Let's go.

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:05.524
This is it.

01:13:18.705 --> 01:13:20.621
<i>Finish your opponent...</i>

01:13:20.805 --> 01:13:22.283
<i>or kill another in his place.</i>

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:23.515
<i>Are you an angel?</i>

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:26.001
<i>No.
I'm not a murderer.</i>

01:13:35.383 --> 01:13:37.181
Hello, pretty.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.482
I never liked you.

01:13:54.808 --> 01:13:58.033
It's funny... I always liked you.

01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:00.542
<i>Are you a coward?</i>

01:14:00.642 --> 01:14:01.881
<i>How do you know?</i>

01:14:01.975 --> 01:14:03.281
<i>Shall You Labor..,..</i>

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:23.687
Traitor.

01:14:29.477 --> 01:14:31.346
You killed The Minister.

01:14:31.444 --> 01:14:33.662
He's the traitor.

01:14:33.862 --> 01:14:35.646
Why should I believe you?

01:14:39.006 --> 01:14:40.678
'Cause you don't have a choice.

01:14:49.257 --> 01:14:50.917
<i>Finish your opponent..,..</i>

01:14:51.017 --> 01:14:52.449
<i>or kill another in his place.</i>

01:14:52.702 --> 01:14:53.983
<i>Are you an angel ?</i>

01:14:55.206 --> 01:14:56.915
Welcome.

01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:22.523
Finally...

01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:25.516
Who are you?

01:15:26.262 --> 01:15:30.184
The real question should be "who are you"?

01:15:31.047 --> 01:15:33.659
You came here for answers,
didn't you?

01:15:35.014 --> 01:15:36.285
You know me.

01:15:36.288 --> 01:15:38.302
Know?

01:15:39.807 --> 01:15:41.998
I created you.

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.471
I gave you life,
Kazuya Mishima.

01:15:48.914 --> 01:15:50.598
Kazuya...

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:53.556
It's my name.

01:15:58.618 --> 01:16:00.328
Who are you?

01:16:00.618 --> 01:16:03.549
It's only natural you
don't remember.

01:16:11.151 --> 01:16:12.539
How...

01:16:13.519 --> 01:16:14.496
You...

01:16:14.685 --> 01:16:16.186
<i>In ancient Sparta,</i>

01:16:16.286 --> 01:16:19.025
<i>male children were sent
into the wilderness</i>

01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:21.144
<i>to live on their own.</i>

01:16:21.866 --> 01:16:27.474
<i>Only those who survived were
allowed to rejoin the clan.</i>

01:16:29.267 --> 01:16:33.672
Yes... Heihachi Mishima.

01:16:34.354 --> 01:16:36.289
Your father.

01:16:56.122 --> 01:16:58.695
I should kill you right now.

01:17:01.298 --> 01:17:03.390
If only you could.

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.864
Heihachi!

01:17:19.107 --> 01:17:21.759
But your mother's blood
runs through you.

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:23.827
You are still weak.

01:17:34.992 --> 01:17:38.138
<i>Your mind was so weak then.</i>

01:17:38.993 --> 01:17:42.860
<i>It made it easy to
wipe it clean.</i>

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:47.696
Your body is a weapon that your
mind cannot control.

01:17:48.305 --> 01:17:50.301
Can you kill without mercy?

01:17:50.601 --> 01:17:53.570
Can you withstand pain that a
lesser man would die from?

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.190
Trust no one, love no one?

01:17:56.194 --> 01:17:57.529
Enough!

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.262
Let's finish this.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.935
We're just getting started.

01:18:16.329 --> 01:18:17.529
Laura...

01:19:51.702 --> 01:19:54.072
One day, perhaps.

01:19:55.502 --> 01:19:57.881
But not today.

01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:09.294
K...

01:24:09.423 --> 01:24:11.069
I'm sorry.

01:24:13.624 --> 01:24:15.782
My name isn't K.

01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:28.634
It's Kazuya Mishima...

01:24:30.324 --> 01:24:31.595
Son..,..

01:24:32.948 --> 01:24:34.945
of Heihachi Mishima...

01:24:36.659 --> 01:24:39.575
the person responsible
for all of this.

01:24:42.315 --> 01:24:44.316
Where is he now?

01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:46.524
For now...

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.635
He likes
to play games.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.600
Let's give him some games.

01:25:18.762 --> 01:25:20.389
Tekken... 

01:25:21.381 --> 01:25:23.900
My empire.

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:26.685
Let them come.

01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:33.032
He will come.

01:25:46.528 --> 01:25:57.000
