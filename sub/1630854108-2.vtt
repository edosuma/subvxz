This was a really bad idea.

Do you see me?

- Well, you're not alone.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.656
When I was young
and I didn't win a beauty pageant,

00:30.656 --> 00:33.575
my mom would tell me it was
because my eyes were too close together.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.828
As though her marrying her second cousin
had nothing to do with it.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.332
And you tell whoever's detailing it,
that if I see swirl marks on it,

00:40.332 --> 00:42.042
I will come kill their family.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.669
Okay. Which car is it?

It's the Bentley.

What's happening here?

00:53.679 --> 00:57.474
Gordon, obviously we
were all thrown yesterday

00:57.474 --> 00:58.809
to find out that Hannah was your daughter,

00:58.809 --> 01:01.478
but, you know,
family dynamics, they're so,

01:01.478 --> 01:02.896
I don't know, what's the word
I'm looking for? Um--

01:02.896 --> 01:05.816
Could you find it
while I'm still young, please?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.277
Gordon, we want her to stay
for the good of the show.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.947
Hey... just yesterday,
I asked her to stay,

01:11.947 --> 01:16.076
and she said, quote,
"I'd rather work at SeaWorld."

01:16.076 --> 01:18.287
And then I had to explain to him
why that's an insult.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.997
Who doesn't love
the Dolphin Spectacular?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.456
The dolphins.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.625
So, what is it? Now you wanna stay?
Why? What?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.419
I, I wanna do the script that I wrote.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.547
Really? 'Cause it felt like you
wanted to shove it up my ass.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.549
No. I--

01:30.549 --> 01:31.842
I wanna tell the truth.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.428
Okay? Because you based
Lawrence on yourself--

01:34.428 --> 01:35.387
- Yes.
- and your new family,

01:35.387 --> 01:38.974
and you left out the old family
that you abandoned.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.809
Didn't abandon. I sent checks.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.643
Fuck your money.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.978
Whoa.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.105

This is how we take
this show to the next level.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.945

Lawrence is complicated, now flawed.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.616
The, The confrontation
in the last scene alone is mwah!

01:55.616 --> 01:59.411
I mean, it's, it's revelatory,
it's profound, it rips your soul out.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.163

Hannah wants another.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.853
a bunch of popcorn flies out of the dryer.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.021
Like that. Something.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.816
- How did I come from you?
- Relax! We'll fix it.

09:25.816 --> 09:29.778
We don't shoot 'til Friday.
It's only Monday!

09:32.197 --> 09:33.907
So, there we were in Gordon's office,

09:33.907 --> 09:36.201
determining the fate of the show,

09:36.201 --> 09:37.661
and everyone looked to me.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.288
Wow, that sounds intense.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.874
It actually reminded me of the ending
of my film <i>Pint Sized Pilot.</i>

09:41.874 --> 09:43.792
I'll set it up.
So, the plane's going down,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.252
and my co-pilot's missing
'cause someone threw

09:45.252 --> 09:46.795
a tennis ball down the aisle.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.547
Wait, did I mention he was
a German Shepherd?

09:48.547 --> 09:51.425
- Honey, you've had enough sweets.
- Mom!

09:51.425 --> 09:53.510
I don't have chicken
and dumplings in the crockpot

09:53.510 --> 09:55.554
just so you can bounce
off the walls all night.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.805
Have some carrots.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.853
- I'll see you.
- Definitely.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.354
Good luck handing out those call sheets.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.483
Woo-hoo. Getting cock-blocked
by Mommy, that's rough.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.403
Dude, stop. She's been coming
to set with me my whole life.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.530
When you were a kid.
How old are you?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
Twenty-four and three-quarters.

10:15.365 --> 10:19.077
Just say 24 and act like it.
Tell her to go knit somewhere else.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.495
It's complicated.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.540
Ever since her and my dad split,
I'm all she's got.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.876
I can't hurt her feelings.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.717
Could you say something to my mom?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.552
- Me?
- Yeah, tell her it's weird for you guys,

10:35.552 --> 10:36.512
so that it doesn't come from me.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.139
Wait, so I'm the one who
has to hurt her feelings?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.142
Yeah, what the fuck.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.150
Ooh, Hannah!
Quick question about the new H scene.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.402
Uh, sure.
Wait, what new H scene?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.488
"Josie opens the dryer.
Instead of clothes,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.657
an avalanche of hot popcorn spills out."

10:56.657 --> 10:58.408
Very funny.
- No, it's not.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.409
Yeah, I agree.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.870
Wait, how did this happen?

11:01.870 --> 11:04.248
I think Jake and Cody stashed
some microwave popcorn in there?

11:04.248 --> 11:07.334
That's not-- Okay.
So, yeah, this bit is cut.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.921
We have run-through in a half hour.
Uh, maybe I should talk to Gordon.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.965
Nope, no need
'cause this is also my show,

11:12.965 --> 11:14.591
so the popcorn bit is cut.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.969
- Thank you.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.808
"Wow... So, I guess
this is your happy family.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.768
You guys are really
into cargo shorts, huh? "

11:24.768 --> 11:25.936
"We like big pockets."

11:25.936 --> 11:27.813
"Got a lotta baggage to carry around?

11:27.813 --> 11:28.814
Whitney exits."

11:28.814 --> 11:30.023
And we're out.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.568
Ah, okay.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.902
Timberly, sweetheart?
Yeah?

11:33.902 --> 11:34.736
You're

11:35.445 --> 11:37.406
still reading the stage directions.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.074
See where it says, "Whitney exits?"
- Yeah?

11:39.074 --> 11:40.325
You're Whitney.
- Yeah.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.285
Exit.
Sorry.

11:41.285 --> 11:42.494
No, no, it's okay.
Yes, yes.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.954
Thank you.
- Can we get her a special script?

11:43.954 --> 11:46.790
That takes us to Scene H
in the laundry room!

11:47.916 --> 11:51.170
Um... please, let me replace her.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.922
Our research shows we need
a young, attractive woman

11:53.922 --> 11:56.341
to reach the 18- to 34-year-old
male demographic.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.802
But she is a terrible actress.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.597
Our research shows that that
has no effect whatsoever.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.766
Well, if you need her so bad,
then what does your research say about me?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.269
Oh, don't worry,
you're extremely popular

12:07.269 --> 12:10.731
with sassy seniors and coupon fanatics.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.358
- Bree, we're ready for you.
- No.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.527
- But, um--
- "This is unreal!

12:15.527 --> 12:17.946
I just cannot believe
you have a daughter!"

12:17.946 --> 12:21.283
"Well, look on the bright side.
Cody has an older sister.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.118
"Now we have someone
to babysit our adult son

12:23.118 --> 12:25.245
on Saturday nights."

12:25.245 --> 12:27.581
"Forgive me if I don't
feel like laughing."

12:29.541 --> 12:32.377
- What happened to my popcorn?
- Hannah said it was cut.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.004
No.
But I don't need to take
it out while we're rehearsing.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.173
I understand, Bree.
There's no reason to get excited.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.549
I'm not excited.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.640
Come in!

12:45.724 --> 12:49.353
Well! Look what the cat dragged in.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.312
Zack's not here.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.689
Actually, I came to see you.
Here's the thing.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.067
Zack's not a kid anymore,
and it's kinda fucked up--

12:55.067 --> 12:57.277
Ooh! Language.
We don't say that.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.949
messed up you're here, you know?
Comin' in to work with him every day?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.118
Oh... I see.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.121
Well... I didn't mean to embarrass him.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.583
I just kinda feel like
this business is scary

13:11.583 --> 13:14.586
and a boy could use all the love
and protection he can get.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.172
Didn't your mother do that for you?

13:17.172 --> 13:19.716
My mom mostly did all
the drugs she could get.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.969
Oh... poor thing.

13:24.471 --> 13:29.893
Wait, you've got a... little something
on your sweet, little cheek.

13:32.354 --> 13:36.316
Get it off... Yeah...
Oop, one more spot.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.114
So what, we're just cutting bits
without telling me now?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.741
Well, I sent you an email,
you just never responded.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.161
- Nice callback.
- Popcorn in a dryer, really?

13:48.161 --> 13:52.082
- That would've worked.
- No. It's... way too broad.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.002
And you didn't even tell me about it.
I'm the co-showrunner.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.045
- Do you remember that?
- 'Kay, when are you gonna realize,

13:57.045 --> 13:58.839
I've been doin' this
a little longer than you.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.424
I know what I'm talkin' about.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.466
Case in point.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.551
That song you wanted,

14:02.551 --> 14:05.262
that St. Margaret's,
whatever the hell it's called,

14:05.262 --> 14:07.514
$80,000 for a song.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.017
Here. Here's a list
of public domain songs.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.435
Pick somethin' you like.

14:11.435 --> 14:12.769
"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain."

14:12.769 --> 14:15.439
I actually like "Camptown Races,"
but author's choice.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.316
Hannah, we need to talk.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.483
Oh, fuck, okay.
I--

14:18.483 --> 14:19.902
Listen, listen, that's Reed

14:19.902 --> 14:21.320
and he's super fuckin'
pissed about Timberly,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.446
so you deal with this.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.365
What, a pissed off actor?
It's easy. They're like children.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.035
You jingle some shiny keys
and you promise 'em a cookie

14:28.035 --> 14:29.036
and they stop crying.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.205
That is so condescending.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.332
He's an artist. He has integrity.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.209
Yes, but he wants a cookie.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.710
Trust me.

14:37.169 --> 14:40.380
- Hi, hi.
- Hannah, we have gotta stop Gordon from--

14:40.923 --> 14:45.052
Oh... Hello.
- Reed, I'm so glad they found ya.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.178
Thanks for gettin' here so fast.

14:46.178 --> 14:46.970
What?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.347
No one-- I came to you.

14:48.347 --> 14:51.391
Yeah, we sent a PA to get you
'cause we gotta talk about Timberly.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.686
It's obvious we got a problem here.
- Oh, yeah. [laughs] Definitely.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.772
She cannot play the material.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.733
She is ruining your words.
- You don't have to convince me, man.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.693
I think it's obvious what has to happen?

15:01.693 --> 15:04.905
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, you need to teach her how to act.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.949
- I-- What?
- Listen, you can get her there.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.201
You practically give
an acting class every day.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.452
Well, I mean, you know, I'm doing--

15:10.452 --> 15:12.412
And Jerry doesn't have your instincts.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.623
Well, I mean, he's pretty good
at movin' the cameras around,

15:14.623 --> 15:17.084
but that's about it.
- Yeah, but you, you move people.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.379
You-- Remember how green
Bree was back in the day, huh?

15:20.379 --> 15:22.965
I mean, she couldn't even
internalize her primary intentions.

15:22.965 --> 15:27.219
But then you, ya did your magic
and you, you molded her into a star.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.137
You saved the whole show,

15:29.137 --> 15:30.556
so I'm askin' you,

15:31.056 --> 15:32.599
you, you gotta do it again.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.852
Gordon.
- Uh, Reed. Hey, Reed.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.645
You, You, You--
[sighs] You know what? He's right.

15:37.563 --> 15:38.772
I'm the only one.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.029
Jingle-jingle.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.876
Ooh, hey, uh, have you seen Timberly?
They need me to save the show.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.546
- I'm sorry, what? No.
- But what-what's with you?

16:03.380 --> 16:07.467
Zack asked me to talk to his mom about
not coming around anymore, so I did.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.760
Okay, good. That's good.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.013
G-Good for you
'cause that-that's weird, you know?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.807
How'd she take it?
- Pretty well. She blew me.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.851
I'm sorry, she-she blew you?

16:16.894 --> 16:19.271
Are you serious?
- A hundred percent.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.607
- Oh god, that's so fucked up.
- I know!

16:21.607 --> 16:24.151
And after I finished,
she told me I was a "good boy" and--

16:24.151 --> 16:25.736
- What?
- gave me orange slices.

16:25.736 --> 16:29.281
- Oh!
- It was nurturing and depraved
all at the same time.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.658
Well, okay.
That, That can never happen again.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.285
I know! You're right.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.830
Why exactly?
- 'Cause what if Zack finds out?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.707
- Finds what out?
- Son of a--

16:38.707 --> 16:41.418
Uh, that I couldn't talk
to your mom yet.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.045
Too hard, huh?
No.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.172
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not that, uh.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.925
She was just busy doing
something else, but I will.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.636
Awesome! You're the best.
Ooh! Orange slices.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.638
No, no, no... But don't.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.310
"They made dumb jokes in the car
when they drove us to school,

16:58.310 --> 16:59.520
"but they were there.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.313
Like I wanted you to be."

17:02.147 --> 17:03.232
That's wonderful.
Okay.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.400
So, deep down, you're devastated
and you're spiraling.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.360
I feel it--
- Okay.

17:06.360 --> 17:10.572
but... what if you want him
to think you're in control?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.200
Let's stand it up.
- Okay.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.826
- Okay?
- Yeah.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.123
What do you want me to say?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.917
I-I did what I did.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.126
I'm not perfect.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.631
Who asked you to be perfect?

17:28.090 --> 17:30.300
None of my friends' fathers were perfect.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.637
'Cause they were dorky,
they wore socks with sandals,

17:33.637 --> 17:35.848
they made dumb jokes in the car
when they drove us to school,

17:35.848 --> 17:37.307
but they were there.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.060
Like I wanted you to be.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.693
The duckling has become the swan.

17:48.569 --> 17:51.196
Great job.
- She's really getting good.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.198
Can I help you with something, Kelly?

17:53.198 --> 17:55.492
Yeah, stop by the hair trailer
when you get a chance

17:55.492 --> 17:57.494
and let's touch up those grays.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.921
Hi! Hi.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.549
You guys talkin' about <i>Step Right Up?</i>

18:10.549 --> 18:13.260
Oh, no, we were talking,
uh, <i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

18:14.511 --> 18:16.889
Well, did you hear we're coming back?

18:18.265 --> 18:23.020
Ooh, guys, it's this awesome sitcom
that was on, like, forever ago--

18:23.020 --> 18:24.438
- Not that long ago.
- and I'm gonna be on it.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.441
Oh, and Bree plays my mom.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.234
- Stepmom.
- Yeah.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.903
- Stepmom.
- Timberly, tell my boyfriend Craig--

18:30.903 --> 18:31.737
Yeah.
- he's a piece of shit.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.113
Sure.
- Oh, fun.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.032
Hey, Craig! You're a piece of shit!

18:37.117 --> 18:39.244
- I love you, Timberly.
- Oh my god. Love you guys, too.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.205
Thank you.
Take care. Have a good tour!

18:41.205 --> 18:44.291
Well, she is fantastic.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.377
Okay, so Stage A is
the Glenn Close stage--
Bye! Bye.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.921
but today, it's Glenn Closed.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.299
- Aww.
- I love that. Love them.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.260
- Hey, I'm so, so glad I caught you, um.
- Yeah.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.972
I just wanted to tell you that...
I know what you're going through.

18:59.765 --> 19:00.933
With Reed.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.892
What do you mean?

19:01.892 --> 19:05.187
Oh, with all the acting notes.
Isn't it driving you crazy?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.606
I mean, I love the guy,
but he can be a lot.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.900
I mean, he's been so nice to me.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.027
- Oh, no, he is the nicest, for sure.
- Right.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.196
And it's just that, like,

19:14.196 --> 19:15.614
he did this with me on my first show,

19:15.614 --> 19:18.700
and then I went out there
and I did everything he told me to do,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.327
like exactly.
- Right.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.829
And it was a disaster.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.457
- Really?
- He's old fashioned.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.376
- Yeah.
- It almost ended my career.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.419
Really?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.630
- Between us girls--
- Yeah.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.340
I'll tell you what you need to know.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.011
So, where do we go from here?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.221
I don't know.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.599
Part of me wants to hug you,

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
and part of me wants to scream!

19:45.102 --> 19:46.937
I've never done this before.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.107
Um, well,

19:51.275 --> 19:54.528
I'm pullin' for the hug,
but I might not have a vote here.

19:55.279 --> 19:59.867
Well... I guess we'll just
have to play it by ear.

20:10.169 --> 20:12.212
Oh, hey, you're back.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.756
Uh, I have something for you,
but, but I'm kind of scared.

20:14.756 --> 20:15.883
Why?

20:15.883 --> 20:17.092
Well, I think it's
'cause I'm from Malibu

20:17.092 --> 20:18.010
and nothing bad happens there.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.678
Oh, don't. What is it, Connor?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.014
Just new pages from the last scene.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.432
New--

20:26.602 --> 20:28.478
Are you fucking kidding me?
We shoot in half an hour.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.981
Okay. Whoa.
That is exactly what Reed said.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.192
I can't believe this.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.165
Hey! Come on in.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.083
I'm just makin' some treats
in the toaster oven.

20:51.335 --> 20:54.505
Yeah, I was thinkin' maybe
we should talk outside.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.133
Oh... I see.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.180
You changed the last scene
without telling me.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.681
- I couldn't find you.
- Oh, let me guess.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.808
You tried to reach me
on my Easy Bake Oven.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.019
Yeah, very funny.
Where'd you disappear to?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.646
To my shrink, okay?

21:11.271 --> 21:12.648
And then I went to Shake Shack

21:12.648 --> 21:15.651
because no professional can cure
this relationship in 50 minutes.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.736
All right, well, listen,
you saw her at run-through,

21:17.736 --> 21:19.863
she was yelling and with the hands.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.242
She can't pull off the, the heavy stuff,
so I lightened it up a bit.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.535
A bit? A bit?

21:24.535 --> 21:26.453
Lawrence now doesn't even
know he has a daughter.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.622
She just shows up at the end
and everyone's thrilled.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.874
- Yeah, trust me. It's better.
- It's better.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.502
Oh, also, you added back in
the dryer popcorn bit?

21:33.502 --> 21:36.421
You weren't here. It's Friday.
I did what I had to do.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.715
You did what you had to do,
so you wouldn't look like an asshole.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.968
Because if Lawrence looks like an asshole,
that means you're an asshole

21:40.968 --> 21:44.513
and you can't be the asshole,
even though, let's be clear,

21:44.513 --> 21:45.931
you're an asshole.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.226
How was therapy today?
Pretty, Pretty productive for you?

21:50.894 --> 21:53.564
You know you've never apologized
once for disappearing.

21:53.564 --> 21:54.398
I--

21:54.940 --> 21:56.775
You know what, honey?
- Don't "honey" me.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.361
This is my story.

21:59.862 --> 22:02.030
Okay? This is my life.
You can't rewrite it.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.908
And you know what? This is my show!

22:04.908 --> 22:08.662
And you're trying to hijack it,
so you can rip me apart.

22:08.662 --> 22:09.872
I'm not gonna be the villain.

22:10.706 --> 22:11.707
Too late.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.718
WARM-UP GUY:
Yeah! Awesome, fantastic.

22:22.718 --> 22:25.387
Oh, wow, are you two married?

22:25.387 --> 22:28.140
This is what I call
a May-December romance.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.851
And by that, I mean,
it may be over by December.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.688
These don't write themselves, people.

22:37.649 --> 22:40.694
-  Thank you.
- Hey.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.322
Bree got into Timberly's head
and completely messed her up.

22:44.323 --> 22:46.366
You think that's bad,
I just fucked Zack's mom.

22:47.159 --> 22:49.995
Jesus... I told you to end that.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.372
I know, but she smelled
like snickerdoodles.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.625
- What the--
- Oh god. What's wrong with me?

22:54.625 --> 22:57.461
Well, for one, you clearly
have mother issues.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.004
No way.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.422
Although, once when I was a kid,

23:00.422 --> 23:03.634
I did call a phone sex hotline
and my mom answered.

23:03.634 --> 23:04.635
What?

23:05.427 --> 23:06.845
But that can't be it.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.767
- I know it was you.

23:12.476 --> 23:15.812
You sabotaged Timberly...
and they gutted my big scene.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.814
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.025
She told me it was you.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.570
That wasn't very supportive
of her, was it?

23:25.531 --> 23:27.908
Why would you undermine her like that?
She's not your competition.

23:27.908 --> 23:30.369
This isn't one of your
stupid, beauty pageants.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.829
Oh, wake up. Hollywood is way worse.

23:32.829 --> 23:36.500
When I was doing my first-ever guest spot
on <i>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,</i>

23:36.500 --> 23:39.586
Jane Seymour tried to crush me
by loosening the wheel to my loom.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.214
And on my last show,
my "gal pal" co-star,

23:42.214 --> 23:44.758
she was so jealous of me
that she fucked the showrunner

23:44.758 --> 23:47.511
and had him turn me into a space insect!

23:47.511 --> 23:50.180
Well, congratulations.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.683
'Cause now Timberly has a story about you.

23:52.683 --> 23:57.521
WARM-UP GUY:
As Lawrence, Reed Sterling!

23:58.981 --> 24:04.820
As Josie, Bree Marie Jensen!

24:04.820 --> 24:07.239
- Hi!

24:09.032 --> 24:11.952
Everybody give one
huge round of applause

24:11.952 --> 24:15.831
for your <i>Step Right Up</i> cast!

24:17.457 --> 24:19.543
See why it's so hard for me
to say anything to my mom?

24:19.543 --> 24:21.378
Look at her. She's glowing.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.766
Hey, Mom, how was hot yoga?

24:34.766 --> 24:35.767
Too hot.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.854
I haven't sweat that much since
you said you were quitting college.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.024
Can I ask you something?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.776
Have you noticed Lawrence acting strange?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.487
Now that you mention it, yeah.
For the last 25 years.

24:55.704 --> 24:56.997
Hey.
- Hi.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.751
- You all right?
- Yeah, sorry.

25:02.336 --> 25:04.129
I'm just really nervous.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.341
I mean, I'm not an actor
like you guys,

25:07.341 --> 25:09.510
so all the changes and the notes.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.637
I just feel like I don't know
what I'm doing.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.971
- Oh.
- And I mean,

25:12.971 --> 25:15.432
Reed is telling me to do everything
from the inside, right?

25:15.432 --> 25:18.185
And-- But you're saying to do
all these things on the outside?

25:18.185 --> 25:22.064
- Timberly.
- I just feel like I am
letting everyone down,

25:22.064 --> 25:24.066
after you guys have been so nice to me.

25:28.237 --> 25:30.239
- Do me a favor, okay?
- Yeah.

25:30.948 --> 25:32.950
Just forget what I said.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.410
I was being stupid.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.913
I was screwing you up
and you were doing so great.

25:37.913 --> 25:41.458
I, I just... I don't know
what I'm talking about.

25:41.458 --> 25:46.880
I haven't acted in 15 years.
I have been so terrified this week.

25:49.258 --> 25:54.471
There is a reason why everyone who
walks past you on this lot loves you.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.473
Okay, honey?

25:56.473 --> 25:57.432
'Kay.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.226
So, listen to Reed

26:00.394 --> 26:02.563
and you're gonna be amazing.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.730
Thank you.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.860
Come here.
We women have to stick together.

26:08.527 --> 26:11.530
Jane Seymour taught me that.
- Who?

26:11.530 --> 26:13.365
Are you ready for the final scene?

26:13.365 --> 26:16.785
Okay, I'm gonna need a lot
of energy for the final scene.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.203
How are you doing?

26:19.705 --> 26:21.748
All I can say is you're lucky
you don't work with your dad.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.835
God, that's his dream.

26:24.835 --> 26:26.795
He's a software engineer at Microsoft.

26:26.795 --> 26:30.424
He made sure I got a Masters
in Computer Science from Stanford,

26:30.424 --> 26:33.844
yet... here I am on the set
of <i>Step Right Up.</i>

26:35.721 --> 26:37.973
He thinks I'm crazy.
- Oh, he's right.

26:39.016 --> 26:42.644
I mean, we're both crazy
for being here, truly.

26:44.730 --> 26:49.067
Mm, when I was a kid,
my parents worked all the time

26:49.067 --> 26:51.820
and I was usually home alone,

26:51.820 --> 26:54.489
studying and watching
TV shows about families

26:54.489 --> 26:56.408
that always seemed happier than mine.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.661
Guess which one was my favorite?

27:00.495 --> 27:03.332
Oh, am I about to lose
all respect for you?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.961
I've probably seen every episode,
five times?

27:07.961 --> 27:10.255
- What?
-  Yeah.

27:10.255 --> 27:13.133
I had a huge crush on Cody.

27:13.926 --> 27:16.470
I used to pause the show
and kiss him through the screen.

27:18.263 --> 27:21.058
Forget I said that.
- Um, I, I will try to.

27:21.808 --> 27:26.230
Hey, Shake Shack.
New pages... for the last scene.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.731
- What? New pages?
- Thank you.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.525
How can he make this any worse?

27:29.525 --> 27:32.736
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
Reed said the pages are pretty tight.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.283
Is everything all right?

27:39.993 --> 27:43.997
I guess I'm just upset with myself
for not looking you up sooner.

27:44.373 --> 27:45.374
Don't be.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.377
If anything, be upset with me.

27:48.919 --> 27:49.753
For what?

27:50.587 --> 27:51.588
I knew about you.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.134
I pretended I didn't, but I did.

27:56.635 --> 28:00.264
I was young, I was scared,
and that's no excuse.

28:01.807 --> 28:02.808
I'm the dad.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.060
I should've been there.

28:05.394 --> 28:06.812
I should've been a <i>mensch.</i>

28:07.271 --> 28:09.982
I made all sorts of excuses for myself.

28:09.982 --> 28:14.194
Your mom hating me,
assuming you would, too.

28:16.530 --> 28:21.159
And if I could go back...
and change things, I would.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.161
But I can't.

28:25.622 --> 28:28.125
But... I'm hoping,

28:28.959 --> 28:30.961
someday, when you're ready,

28:32.671 --> 28:33.881
you'll give me a second chance.

28:40.721 --> 28:44.349
For god's sake, you two hug.

28:57.237 --> 29:00.157
Um, [clears throat] hey.

29:00.157 --> 29:03.327
- Oh! Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, uh, you're,
you're leaving already?

29:03.327 --> 29:05.370
Yeah, I taped
the Clippers game so I just--

29:05.370 --> 29:07.664
I wanna get out of there before
anybody tells me who won.

29:08.749 --> 29:09.583
Um,

29:11.168 --> 29:12.961
thank you for that, the scene.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.881
Oh yeah. I thought that
worked pretty good, right?

29:15.881 --> 29:16.882
Yeah.

29:16.882 --> 29:20.385
Sorry, you probably wanted me
to have him say a little bit more to her,

29:20.385 --> 29:24.014
but... characters can't change
that much in one episode.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.350
Takes a little time.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.393
All right, see you Monday, yeah?

29:28.393 --> 29:29.770
- Yeah. Looks like it.
- Okay.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.439
Oh, um,
I'm sorry, too.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.399
What are you sorry for?

29:41.615 --> 29:44.034
You're right. It's too broad.
