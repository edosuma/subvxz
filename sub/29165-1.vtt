02:52.837 --> 02:55.207
What kind of bird
is that?

02:58.009 --> 03:00.346
Why don't you sit up
with the others and meditate,

03:00.479 --> 03:03.014
and you can imagine
all the birds you want.

03:03.149 --> 03:06.686
I don't want to
close my eyes today.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.860
Do you want to help me
ring the bell?

04:42.413 --> 04:44.584
Okay, here you
go, hand these out.

04:45.617 --> 04:47.120
Good job.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.458
Here, give them some pongal.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.641
What did you get?

05:43.776 --> 05:46.045
Nice to see you too.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.987
What is this?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.990
Where's the food, the beds we
were promised, school supplies?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.927
That's all I could get
for the money.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.677
So where's the money?

06:19.845 --> 06:21.880
They want you to meet with them
in New York.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.682
What?

06:23.815 --> 06:25.884
To tell them
why we are a worthy cause.

06:26.017 --> 06:28.019
How many hoops
do we have to jump through?

06:28.153 --> 06:30.923
- It's their money.
- I'm not gonna teach them

06:31.057 --> 06:33.092
about compassion
when the kids need me here.

06:33.225 --> 06:34.560
Tell them
to save the whales.

06:34.692 --> 06:36.194
They want to give us
$2 million.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.759
Look at his pants.

07:07.892 --> 07:09.661
He's a baby.

07:10.928 --> 07:13.165
He peed his bed.

07:14.199 --> 07:16.068
Get out of here!

07:17.836 --> 07:19.638
- Stop it! I hate you!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Shh.

07:19.771 --> 07:21.073
Stop!

07:21.206 --> 07:23.742
Jai, Jai, Jai, it's okay.
It's okay. Shh.

07:25.276 --> 07:27.112
Can you get me some sheets?

07:27.245 --> 07:28.480
It's okay. It's okay.

07:28.613 --> 07:30.348
You're okay. You're okay.

07:30.482 --> 07:33.485
I'm here. I'm right here.
Look at me. Look at me.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.520
Look at me.
I'm right here, okay?

07:35.653 --> 07:37.589
<i>I'm not leaving him.</i>

07:39.725 --> 07:40.926
Do you hear me?

07:41.059 --> 07:42.694
I do.

07:49.434 --> 07:52.138
Why don't I go to New York
and meet with them?

07:53.237 --> 07:54.307
You could fill me in,

07:54.439 --> 07:56.175
and I could take them
through it.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.645
It's on my way
to Argentina.

08:00.778 --> 08:02.281
Sort of.

08:05.817 --> 08:07.185
Yes.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.355
I understand.

08:09.487 --> 08:10.889
Mm-hm.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.093
Of course.

08:17.295 --> 08:18.431
It has to be you.

08:25.437 --> 08:26.706
Bye-bye.

08:26.838 --> 08:28.874
Bye-bye. Ta-ta.

08:29.007 --> 08:30.442
Bye-bye.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.544
Bye-bye.

08:34.812 --> 08:36.048
Bye-bye.

08:36.181 --> 08:38.082
Check on him every night.

08:38.216 --> 08:41.318
We were here long before God
brought you to us, Isabel.

08:41.452 --> 08:43.922
I'm not coming back without
a suitcase full of money.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.146
Bye.

Hey, guys. What's up?

09:44.014 --> 09:46.552
Tanya, you don't have
to sell them on it.

09:46.684 --> 09:48.219
Just walk them through it.

09:48.352 --> 09:51.923
Give them all the information
they need. What else?

09:52.057 --> 09:54.992
Yeah, well, then we're gonna
need Bill on the call, so.

09:55.126 --> 09:57.228
Can somebody shoot him
an e-mail?

09:57.363 --> 10:00.566
You know what?
If you can't get him tonight,

10:00.698 --> 10:02.067
then let's do this tomorrow

10:02.201 --> 10:05.037
because I don't want to go
through it twice.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.941
Okay? Uh, Gwen,
can you stay on the line?

10:09.075 --> 10:11.076
Will you get Bill
first thing tomorrow

10:11.208 --> 10:13.778
and then get me? Okay.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.415
Okay.

10:17.548 --> 10:21.385
Uh-huh. Well, is Cahill at home
or at the office?

10:21.519 --> 10:23.721
Will you text me
her cell, please?

10:23.855 --> 10:26.991
Okay. I'm finished
for the night. Bye-bye.

10:27.125 --> 10:30.828
Chickens! Little chickens!

10:30.962 --> 10:33.230
Hi, Dusty. Hi.

10:33.365 --> 10:35.634
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Hi, Mom.

10:35.767 --> 10:36.802
Uh-oh.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.370
You know
I don't like that game.

10:38.503 --> 10:40.372
- But Dad said we could.
- Dad said we could.

10:40.505 --> 10:43.274
He did?
Well, Mommy's home now, okay?

10:43.408 --> 10:44.943
- Just five more minutes.
- Mm...

10:45.076 --> 10:47.446
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

10:51.115 --> 10:53.184
Richard,
you want to show me 2300?

11:00.192 --> 11:02.028
And 4000?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.163
Right,
cycle through them.

11:14.773 --> 11:15.841
Hi, bunny.

11:15.974 --> 11:17.509
Hi, Daddy.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.445
<i>How are you?
What's going on?</i>

11:20.578 --> 11:21.779
Nothing.

11:21.913 --> 11:24.515
Just getting married
this weekend.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.451
Yeah, I heard.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.521
- Not that big a deal.
- <i>Grace!</i>

11:28.653 --> 11:30.155
Milly bought us
a round of shots.

11:32.190 --> 11:36.027
<i>Wow. Sounds like
you're having fun over there.</i>

11:36.160 --> 11:37.228
Kind of.

11:38.263 --> 11:39.264
Hey, Grace?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.432
<i>Yeah?</i>

11:41.567 --> 11:43.435
It's gonna be perfect, okay?

11:43.567 --> 11:46.371
<i>Your mom's got everyone
working at maximum efficiency.</i>

11:47.839 --> 11:49.708
<i>Thank you, Daddy.</i>

11:49.841 --> 11:51.409
<i>Um, how's...?
How's the show coming?</i>

11:51.543 --> 11:54.712
You know, work in progress.
Thanks for asking.

11:54.846 --> 11:58.182
I just...
I wanted to call and say hi.

11:58.316 --> 12:00.219
<i>I love you, Gracie.</i>

12:01.318 --> 12:02.253
I love you too.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.456
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

12:10.863 --> 12:14.600
Congratulations!

12:14.734 --> 12:17.002
- We love you, Grace!
- I love you.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.377
"The expression on his face
changed rapidly

12:25.510 --> 12:26.910
"from fear to sadness
to anger.

12:27.044 --> 12:28.413
"'Who are you, boy?

12:28.546 --> 12:30.915
"Did you draw
these pictures?'

12:31.048 --> 12:32.518
"Hugo didn't answer him.

12:32.650 --> 12:35.453
"'I said,
did you draw these pictures?'

12:35.586 --> 12:38.624
"Hugo growled again
and spit on the floor.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.626
"'Who did you steal
this notebook from?'

12:40.759 --> 12:42.228
'I didn't steal it!'"

12:57.743 --> 13:00.646
What is wrong with the boys?
Why are they reading?

13:00.778 --> 13:02.748
Hey, did you tell them
that they can play

13:02.880 --> 13:04.949
that killing-each-other-
in-outer-space game?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.951
<i>Lords of Domination?</i> Maybe.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.989
- So how does it look?
- I don't know.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.325
It's never quite
like I imagine.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.793
No, it's gonna be great
The work is beautiful.

13:15.927 --> 13:17.095
You should just relax

13:17.229 --> 13:18.997
- and try to enjoy it.
- And Gracie called.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.232
I think she was looking
for some reassurance.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.268
She sounded nervous.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.737
Oh, guess it runs
in the family.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.572
- You feeling nervous?
- Are you nervous?

13:27.706 --> 13:29.173
- Are you nervous?
- Are you nervous?

13:29.307 --> 13:31.576
- One second. I'm getting a call.
- Are you nervous?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.312
- She can't talk now.
- No.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.480
- She's feeling nervous.
- Stop tickling me.

13:35.613 --> 13:37.850
- Don't. No! No, no!
- Does this make you nervous?

13:37.982 --> 13:39.850
- Who's nervous now?
- Do not... Oh, my God!

13:39.984 --> 13:41.987
No, no, no.

13:46.291 --> 13:50.795
Uh-huh. How'd they respond
to the retention period?

13:50.928 --> 13:52.730
Well, that's not
gonna work for me.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.733
We can give
on the deferred compensation,

13:54.865 --> 13:58.370
but the retention period
is nonnegotiable, okay?

13:58.503 --> 14:01.139
All right. Uh,
look, I'm walking the dog,

14:01.273 --> 14:04.042
so I'll call you back
when I get in the car.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.711
Thanks.

14:54.092 --> 14:57.896
Dusty, what are you doing?
No, no, no. Don't eat that.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.552
Miss Andersen,
welcome to New York.

15:21.686 --> 15:24.223
We're so happy you'll be
staying with us at the hotel.

15:24.355 --> 15:25.758
Right this way.

15:27.658 --> 15:30.028
This is our 14th-floor
penthouse suite.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.766
It's 1000 square feet
with a 650 square-foot terrace.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.768
A Carrara marble bathroom
with a deep soaking tub

15:36.900 --> 15:39.971
and a rainfall shower.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.473
<i>This is your cell phone.</i>

15:41.606 --> 15:44.408
There's a car
at your disposal.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.546
My number and the driver's
are both programmed.

15:47.679 --> 15:50.414
Anything that I can do to make
your stay more comfortable,

15:50.548 --> 15:52.317
please don't hesitate
to ask.

16:13.738 --> 16:16.975
- Isabel?
- Yes?

16:17.107 --> 16:20.077
I'm Jonathan. I'm here
to take you to your meeting.

16:20.211 --> 16:22.413
Oh, okay.

16:22.547 --> 16:23.480
How's the hotel?

16:23.615 --> 16:24.950
- You comfortable?
- Yes.

16:25.082 --> 16:27.852
Good.
I chose it myself.

16:29.787 --> 16:31.590
Have you ever met
Theresa?

16:31.722 --> 16:32.657
No.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.993
She's very impressive.

16:35.126 --> 16:37.829
She built Horizon from nothing
22 years ago,

16:37.962 --> 16:40.932
and now it's the biggest
media placement company

16:41.066 --> 16:42.134
in the United States.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.002
It sounds
like you know her well.

16:44.134 --> 16:46.104
I've worked at the company
for four years.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.340
And she's
my mother-in-law.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.143
Or will be,
on Saturday.

16:51.275 --> 16:54.044
- Marrying her daughter.
- Mm.

16:54.177 --> 16:55.580
Congratulations.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.583
Thanks.

17:04.155 --> 17:05.923
How long will you be away?

17:07.723 --> 17:09.560
Just a week.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.435
So will you be back
for my birthday?

17:17.568 --> 17:18.903
I don't miss birthdays, Jai.

17:19.037 --> 17:20.905
There's free ice cream.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.746
Thank you so much.

17:41.859 --> 17:44.163
I'm so sorry.
They're almost finished.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.398
<i>But I keep telling them...</i>

17:46.530 --> 17:48.332
Christine? Christine,

17:48.467 --> 17:49.935
the valuation
potentially changes

17:50.067 --> 17:51.502
if it leaks
into next quarter.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.805
- Can I get you water?
- ...conceding a few points,

17:53.938 --> 17:56.207
- and that's fine with me.
- No, thank you.

17:56.339 --> 17:58.809
<i>Okay,
but I think the original number is...</i>

17:58.943 --> 18:00.745
Sorry. Can you
excuse me one moment?

18:00.878 --> 18:03.213
Tanya and I will
call back with suggestions.

18:03.347 --> 18:05.649
Yes, that's great.
And I've got to go.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.386
I'll talk to you later.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.587
I don't know why we hired
someone to guide us

18:09.721 --> 18:11.823
through this process
who we now need to guide.

18:11.957 --> 18:14.326
She's been through
this, so that's valuable.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.327
Can we think about
renegotiating her fee?

18:16.461 --> 18:17.996
We're doing most
of the work here.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.764
Don't you think?
Because I think so.

18:19.897 --> 18:21.064
- Okay? Hi.
- Okay. Okay.

18:21.199 --> 18:23.601
I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

18:23.734 --> 18:24.601
You must be Isabel.

18:24.736 --> 18:25.937
- Yes.
- I'm Theresa.

18:26.069 --> 18:27.605
Theresa,
it's so nice to meet you.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.307
Nice to meet you too.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.376
It's so clear today
that you can see New Jersey.

18:32.509 --> 18:34.712
I don't know
why you'd want to though. Heh.

18:34.846 --> 18:37.249
Let's go to my office.

18:40.017 --> 18:42.886
Please, come in, sit down.
You must be exhausted.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.923
- I'm fine.
- What's the time difference?

18:45.056 --> 18:48.059
- Nine hours. Thank you.
- Oof. Here, have a seat.

18:48.192 --> 18:51.963
So I, um...
I watched the video

18:52.096 --> 18:53.964
my group brought back
from India.

18:54.097 --> 18:55.599
So what's really
going on there

18:55.733 --> 18:57.601
just can't be understood
through a video.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.104
I think it gave
a pretty good sense.

19:00.238 --> 19:03.041
There are over 200,000 child
prostitutes in the south alone.

19:03.174 --> 19:05.509
Five times that number
suffer from malnutrition.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.447
Those numbers increase when you
get into the bigger cities.

19:08.579 --> 19:09.681
Hundreds of thousands die

19:09.815 --> 19:11.449
from minor illnesses
and infections,

19:11.583 --> 19:13.852
completely preventable
and for very little money,

19:13.984 --> 19:15.453
if someone
had the inclination.

19:15.586 --> 19:17.689
Yeah, it's infuriating,
isn't it?

19:17.823 --> 19:21.560
- Because it's preventable.
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.

19:21.692 --> 19:24.028
I have the caterers on the line.
They want to know

19:24.162 --> 19:26.530
if they can use mussels
and shrimp in the risotto.

19:26.663 --> 19:27.932
There's a lobster shortage.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.201
Is there
a lobster shortage,

19:30.335 --> 19:33.005
or can they not get
enough lobster?

19:33.137 --> 19:34.471
I'm not sure.

19:34.605 --> 19:35.874
Will you find out?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.842
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry about that.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.777
You just caught me
at a very busy time.

19:39.911 --> 19:41.879
My daughter's getting married
this weekend.

19:42.012 --> 19:43.814
- I met your son-in-law.
- Yeah, Jonathan.

19:43.948 --> 19:46.117
Well, Grace says
she's in love,

19:46.250 --> 19:48.452
and she's ready
to get married, and...

19:48.586 --> 19:51.323
I could fight her,
and tell her she's too young,

19:51.455 --> 19:53.224
that she doesn't know
what she's doing.

19:53.357 --> 19:55.960
And have her hate me
forever, or...

19:56.094 --> 19:58.163
I could give her
a beautiful wedding.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.101
Do you have kids?

20:03.233 --> 20:04.601
- No.
- Partner?

20:04.734 --> 20:06.771
No, my work
is all-consuming.

20:08.038 --> 20:09.340
Yeah, I get it,
it's a lot.

20:09.473 --> 20:11.208
It's really a lot
to manage both.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.446
I just always wanted both,
so I worked hard at it.

20:14.578 --> 20:16.213
I have twin boys too.

20:16.347 --> 20:18.683
I worked hard to get them,
believe me.

20:21.352 --> 20:23.254
So we do have a list
of priorities,

20:23.387 --> 20:25.456
if you're interested
in seeing that.

20:25.590 --> 20:26.891
Okay.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.259
What we'd like to do

20:28.393 --> 20:30.428
is take in three times
the number of kids.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.564
- Okay.
- Change our food program,

20:33.698 --> 20:34.833
subsidize,

20:34.967 --> 20:37.035
buy from local farmers,
vaccinate...

20:37.169 --> 20:39.871
Which can be done
for under $5 per child.

20:40.003 --> 20:41.605
Mm-hm.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.607
This is, um...

20:43.740 --> 20:44.776
It's great.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.544
It's very,
very impressive...

20:46.678 --> 20:48.847
- Thank you.
- the work you're doing.

20:48.980 --> 20:52.384
I feel I need a little more time
to explore this.

20:52.517 --> 20:53.851
There are a lot

20:53.984 --> 20:56.253
of very deserving
organizations out there.

20:56.386 --> 20:57.422
What?

20:57.556 --> 20:59.258
I'm sorry,
I was under the impression

20:59.391 --> 21:01.592
that you had already decided
to be involved.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.428
If you look
at the information there,

21:03.561 --> 21:05.396
you can see
that the need is undeniable.

21:05.529 --> 21:08.165
Clearly. I just have
a big weekend ahead of me.

21:08.299 --> 21:10.835
So leave all this with me,
we'll have lunch on Monday,

21:10.968 --> 21:13.772
I'll tell you what I can do.
Meantime, come to the wedding.

21:13.904 --> 21:15.606
We can get to know
each other better.

21:15.740 --> 21:16.942
I have a flight to India.

21:17.075 --> 21:18.776
Staying the weekend
won't kill you.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.413
Gwen? Gwen? Can you get Isabel
an invitation to the wedding?

21:22.547 --> 21:23.847
Right away.

21:23.981 --> 21:26.149
And you won't be uncomfortable,
I promise you.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.919
It's just a big party.
It'll be fun.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.422
Dr. Cahill is here
for the insurance workup.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.923
- Send her in.
- I need a physical?

21:32.056 --> 21:33.557
No, not for you.
It's for me.

21:33.692 --> 21:36.059
Lot of hoops to jump
through to sell your company.

21:36.193 --> 21:38.930
Thank you so much. Thank you.
What a pleasure to meet you.

21:39.063 --> 21:41.967
- Thank you so much for your time.
- I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

22:17.999 --> 22:18.836
- Style is classic.
- Right.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.472
- Allow me to show you.
- We're gonna go ahead and lose...

22:21.605 --> 22:24.075
I understand your reticence.
Let's go. Time is money.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.509
Chop-chop. Come on. Come on.

22:25.643 --> 22:27.678
I see one swan here.
I need to see three.

22:27.811 --> 22:29.646
Let's do this. Come on.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.515
Let's go.
You, sir, side door, please.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.117
Yeah, they got the lobster.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.318
- Easy, easy.
- What? What'd you do?

22:35.452 --> 22:37.989
I nixed the ice sculpture,
and Melinda's having a fit.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.824
Sir, could we hurry it up?
Thank you.

22:39.957 --> 22:42.826
Probably not the time to tell
her that we need another chair.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.461
Come on. Time is money.
Let's go!

22:44.596 --> 22:46.830
I invited somebody
from work.

22:46.964 --> 22:48.567
Maybe...

22:48.700 --> 22:50.334
I just won't tell her...

22:50.468 --> 22:53.305
...And put it in after,
when she leaves.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.973
- Where's Grace?
- Is she gonna leave?

22:55.105 --> 22:56.540
- She's in the back.
- Heh. Okay.

22:56.674 --> 22:58.041
You got this? Okay.

23:06.684 --> 23:09.287
Yeah. Okay, thank you.

23:09.420 --> 23:12.724
Hi. So if you could just
wrap them around the tree?

23:12.856 --> 23:17.228
And then, also,
more just hanging down a foot.

23:17.361 --> 23:19.764
But, yeah,
I'll be right back, okay?

23:19.896 --> 23:22.366
- The chairs are too slanted.
- I told you.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.903
How you doing?

23:25.036 --> 23:26.371
- Doing okay?
- Yeah.

23:27.571 --> 23:28.439
Any doubts?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.375
- You wish.
- No.

23:30.508 --> 23:31.910
I wish what you wish.

23:32.042 --> 23:33.777
Thank you.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.248
I don't know why you can't live
together for a while though.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.716
Really?

23:38.849 --> 23:41.718
And he's not as good-looking
as you.

23:41.853 --> 23:44.355
You went there. That's nice.

23:44.489 --> 23:47.025
Is there anything else?

23:47.157 --> 23:49.527
You'll always be mine,
remember that.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.231
God,
you're honestly the worst.

23:54.365 --> 23:55.700
You're the worst.

23:58.769 --> 24:01.472
Can you just, like, try
before the wedding

24:01.605 --> 24:04.375
to get
all of your crying out?

24:04.509 --> 24:07.511
- Yeah, I will. Heh.
- It sets me off.

24:07.644 --> 24:08.846
You set me off.

24:10.647 --> 24:11.849
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

24:11.982 --> 24:13.617
I have to go. I'm so busy.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.353
- I have so many things to do.
- Me too.

24:15.486 --> 24:16.653
I have chairs to un-slant

24:16.788 --> 24:18.289
- and stuff like that.
- Oh, my God.

25:05.769 --> 25:08.440
What? That's awesome!

25:43.339 --> 25:46.076
Yeah, it's big.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.679
It's big,
but it's also small.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.580
<i>All the buildings
are squeezed together</i>

25:49.713 --> 25:51.816
<i>in these really small,
little spaces.</i>

25:51.949 --> 25:53.484
Are there birds?

25:53.617 --> 25:55.352
<i>Yeah, there's birds.</i>

25:55.486 --> 25:57.722
But they're different
from what we're used to.

25:57.855 --> 26:00.091
<i>When will you be back?</i>

26:00.223 --> 26:03.727
As soon as I can.
I want you to set a good example

26:03.861 --> 26:05.196
for the others
while I'm gone.

26:05.328 --> 26:06.998
Okay.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.366
<i>Will you put
Preena on the phone?</i>

26:09.500 --> 26:11.301
Okay. Goodbye, Miss Isabel.

26:11.434 --> 26:12.936
Bye, Jai.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.242
So? What do you think?

26:19.376 --> 26:21.211
Well, I think
we could get 100 beds

26:21.346 --> 26:23.114
for what they're paying
for this suite.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.383
<i>I hope this wasn't
too good to be true.</i>

26:25.516 --> 26:27.752
I'm not coming back
without a suitcase full of...

26:27.885 --> 26:29.720
<i>A suitcase full of
money, I know.</i>

26:29.854 --> 26:31.890
Can I call you back?

26:33.423 --> 26:36.394
Excuse me. What's...?
What's going on here?

26:36.528 --> 26:39.831
Miss Young thought you might
need a dress. For the wedding.

26:52.509 --> 26:53.377
Mom, please.

26:53.510 --> 26:55.145
Sorry.

26:55.279 --> 26:57.581
You look beautiful,
honey.

26:57.714 --> 27:00.050
You've told me that.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.485
Like, a lot.

27:02.619 --> 27:04.254
Well, because
it's true, you do.

27:04.387 --> 27:06.457
- You look really beautiful.
- Thank you.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.862
Grace and Jonathan,

27:43.994 --> 27:49.000
today you're here to engage
in a shared path.

28:02.613 --> 28:05.683
Life will throw you
its ups and downs...

28:08.751 --> 28:10.721
Be patient with each other,

28:10.855 --> 28:15.527
knowing that change happens
slowly and gradually.

28:15.660 --> 28:19.063
Seek inspiration
from your family and friends.

28:19.195 --> 28:22.933
To make this relationship work
will take love.

28:23.067 --> 28:25.036
This is the core
of your marriage

28:25.169 --> 28:26.671
and why you are here today.

28:26.804 --> 28:30.007
It will take trust to know
that in your hearts

28:30.141 --> 28:32.410
you truly want
what's best for each other.

28:32.542 --> 28:36.346
It will take dedication
to stay open to one another,

28:36.480 --> 28:38.717
and to learn and grow
together.

28:38.849 --> 28:41.118
It will take faith
to go forward together

28:41.251 --> 28:45.188
without knowing exactly
what the future brings.

28:45.323 --> 28:46.958
It will take commitment

28:47.090 --> 28:51.161
to hold to the journey that
you've both pledged to today.

28:52.195 --> 28:53.697
Rings, please.

28:58.001 --> 28:59.671
Thank you.

29:04.173 --> 29:05.509
Grace and Jonathan,

29:05.643 --> 29:08.278
it is my humble honor
and divine pleasure

29:08.412 --> 29:11.015
to pronounce you
husband and wife.

29:11.147 --> 29:12.583
Congratulations!

30:18.582 --> 30:20.284
This one of his sculptures?

30:20.417 --> 30:22.118
- Yeah, he made it for them.
- Wonderful.

30:22.252 --> 30:23.120
An original piece.

30:23.253 --> 30:24.454
Thank you.

30:25.856 --> 30:26.824
And...

30:26.957 --> 30:29.126
Because
it's a special occasion,

30:29.259 --> 30:32.396
you may have them,
but before dinner...

30:36.099 --> 30:37.834
- But tonight you enjoy.
- You enjoy.

30:37.968 --> 30:39.637
Ha-ha-ha. Good.

30:41.638 --> 30:43.406
All right?

30:43.540 --> 30:44.674
Mom said...

30:44.808 --> 30:46.810
Oh, yeah.
No, we need a picture.

30:46.943 --> 30:49.712
- We got to go. Picture.
- Gracie!

30:49.846 --> 30:52.482
- Get in here, honey.
- A little bit more that way?

30:52.615 --> 30:54.884
Yeah, this way. She wants
to get the light right.

30:55.018 --> 30:55.885
Okay.

30:56.019 --> 30:57.721
She's an artist.

30:57.855 --> 31:00.191
- Perfect.
- Everybody smile.

31:00.324 --> 31:01.558
Thank you.

31:01.692 --> 31:03.460
You with your parents?

31:03.594 --> 31:05.897
Okay. So, what do you say?

31:08.798 --> 31:11.168
All right. All right, perfect.

31:13.537 --> 31:17.542
<i>♪ The way you stare
In my eyes ♪</i>

31:19.210 --> 31:21.812
<i>♪ The way you may have me ♪</i>

31:21.944 --> 31:24.682
<i>♪ How you make me feel ♪</i>

31:24.815 --> 31:28.553
<i>♪ I think I am in love ♪</i>

31:40.063 --> 31:41.265
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

31:41.398 --> 31:42.699
What are you doing here?

31:44.734 --> 31:46.703
Hi. Good, you made it.

31:46.836 --> 31:49.105
I was a little bit late.
I missed the first part.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.740
The traffic. We were stuck...

31:50.875 --> 31:53.410
That's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.112
You met my husband? Yeah?

31:55.246 --> 31:56.880
So Isabel runs an orphanage
in India

31:57.013 --> 32:00.083
- that I'm thinking of funding.
- Oh.

32:00.217 --> 32:02.086
I thought it'd be nice
if she could come.

32:02.219 --> 32:03.587
Yeah.

32:03.721 --> 32:05.756
Mom, should I change my dress
before dinner?

32:05.890 --> 32:07.758
No. People like to see the bride

32:07.892 --> 32:09.794
in her beautiful dress.
It looks so good.

32:09.926 --> 32:12.862
This is our daughter, Grace.
This is Isabel.

32:12.997 --> 32:14.532
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:14.665 --> 32:15.765
Beautiful dress.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.302
Let's double-check
that playlist.

32:18.435 --> 32:20.203
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool. Hey!

32:20.337 --> 32:21.805
Glad you could make it.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.106
Thank you for having me.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.307
- A picture.
- Okay.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.675
- Yeah.
- All right. Here we go.

32:25.808 --> 32:27.478
- Dad. Come on.
- All together.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.079
- No, you.
- Isabel, you too.

32:29.212 --> 32:30.681
- Yeah.
- Tight.

32:30.814 --> 32:32.750
- Come on, let's do it.
- Perfect.

32:32.883 --> 32:33.985
And...

32:37.755 --> 32:38.623
Perfect.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.091
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:40.223 --> 32:42.425
- Congratulations.
- Let's go party like it's 2019.

32:42.558 --> 32:44.427
- Get in there. Have fun.
- You too. Come on.

32:44.561 --> 32:46.430
- Don't be shy.
- Yes. Everybody.

32:46.564 --> 32:49.834
I want to make sure that
you get some candids too, all right?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.308
- Oatmeal.
- Hamburgers.

33:02.646 --> 33:05.148
I'm on this paleo thing.

33:05.281 --> 33:08.519
Training for a tri in Hawaii
on the Big Island.

33:10.721 --> 33:15.292
Hi. Hello.
I want to welcome you all.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.595
Wow.

33:18.729 --> 33:21.365
I thought the saying "I do" part
would be the hardest.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.436
When I started working
for Theresa,

33:25.568 --> 33:28.873
I thought
I was just getting a great job

33:29.006 --> 33:31.342
for one of the most
forward-thinking entrepreneurs

33:31.474 --> 33:33.743
I had ever read about.
But very quickly,

33:33.877 --> 33:36.712
I came to dread
coming in to work.

33:36.846 --> 33:38.048
It wasn't my boss's fault.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.884
Well, sort of, it was.

33:41.018 --> 33:43.053
You see, two years ago,

33:43.186 --> 33:45.055
Grace started coming in
with Theresa.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.825
She was working in the Design
department for the summer.

33:47.958 --> 33:50.761
She's an amazing artist,
for those of you who don't know.

33:50.894 --> 33:53.564
Yeah, we know! Whoo!

33:53.696 --> 33:55.332
Anyway...

33:56.732 --> 33:59.168
I saw them
coming through the lobby,

33:59.303 --> 34:02.072
these two beautiful,
powerful women,

34:02.204 --> 34:03.740
and I froze.

34:03.874 --> 34:05.308
Which one
is he in love with?

34:05.442 --> 34:08.143
But I spent the next month
doing everything I could

34:08.277 --> 34:10.847
to just be in the same place
at the same time as Grace.

34:10.981 --> 34:14.252
And, finally, I braved
an elevator ride with her.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.353
Do you remember
my genius banter?

34:17.487 --> 34:19.056
"What floor?"

34:19.190 --> 34:20.858
Yeah, it was not good.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.327
Until one day,

34:23.460 --> 34:25.194
- I got lucky.
- Hey!

34:25.329 --> 34:26.763
All right, not like that.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.567
We were in standing line
at the company pub.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.268
She was right in front of me.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.737
And she had forgotten
her wallet.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.639
So I paid.

34:36.773 --> 34:39.911
And it was the best $14
that I ever spent.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.411
Aw.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.580
Grace, I love you
more than anything.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.784
And I couldn't be happier
that you agreed to marry me.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.889
All right!

34:55.525 --> 34:57.662
It's gonna be
a fun honeymoon.

34:58.628 --> 35:00.163
Whoo!

35:01.398 --> 35:02.399
Hi.

35:02.532 --> 35:04.802
Hi.
You're not quite free yet.

35:04.934 --> 35:06.871
Um...

35:07.003 --> 35:09.039
Jonathan,

35:09.172 --> 35:11.441
I love you. Heh.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.577
And I'm so happy
to be your wife.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.279
I can't believe
I can say that now.

35:16.413 --> 35:19.150
Um...

35:19.282 --> 35:22.152
But this this speech
isn't for you.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.322
It's for my mom and dad.

35:24.454 --> 35:26.824
Dad.

35:26.956 --> 35:30.126
I don't know a girl
who is closer to her father

35:30.260 --> 35:31.661
than I am with you.

35:31.795 --> 35:35.531
And I... I am
so grateful for that...

35:35.664 --> 35:37.367
most of the time.

35:39.302 --> 35:42.506
I've gotten so much
from you.

35:42.639 --> 35:44.608
My sulking.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.811
And my sense of humor.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.446
Unfortunately, my nose.

35:51.981 --> 35:54.784
And thank you
for the beautiful sculpture.

35:54.918 --> 35:56.786
Yeah. I don't know
if it's Grace and me

35:56.920 --> 35:57.855
or Grace and her dad.

35:57.987 --> 35:59.522
Jonathan.

35:59.655 --> 36:01.224
I'm kidding, of course.
Absolutely.

36:02.826 --> 36:04.028
Mom.

36:04.161 --> 36:07.798
You... You've made
this night so special.

36:07.931 --> 36:10.268
You are...

36:11.335 --> 36:13.135
the most caring,

36:13.269 --> 36:15.172
loving,

36:15.306 --> 36:18.041
best example of a woman
I could have ever asked

36:18.175 --> 36:19.109
for in a mother.

36:19.242 --> 36:20.678
Thank you.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.349
And for those of you
who don't know,

36:27.483 --> 36:28.818
I had the rare experience

36:28.952 --> 36:31.153
of getting to choose
my own mother.

36:31.288 --> 36:34.557
It was just me and my dad
for the first year of my life.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.494
My dad and I
went everywhere together,

36:37.626 --> 36:39.829
with me
strapped to his chest.

36:39.963 --> 36:41.698
And one day,

36:41.831 --> 36:44.567
we were walking
down the street in SoHo,

36:44.701 --> 36:46.403
and this...

36:46.536 --> 36:50.506
This beautiful woman
with bright red hair

36:50.641 --> 36:52.675
had just moved
to the neighborhood.

36:52.809 --> 36:54.510
And I guess we looked
like locals,

36:54.643 --> 36:56.546
so she asked
if we knew of a place

36:56.681 --> 36:57.947
to get a good cup of coffee.

36:58.081 --> 37:00.518
And what did you say?

37:00.650 --> 37:02.351
"I don't drink coffee.
I don't know."

37:02.485 --> 37:04.554
Right. Yeah.

37:04.688 --> 37:06.256
And that would have been that,

37:06.389 --> 37:07.923
except I grabbed hold
of her hair,

37:08.057 --> 37:10.327
and I wouldn't let her go.

37:11.728 --> 37:15.166
Mom, I'm so happy
that I chose you.

37:20.237 --> 37:24.374
To my parents,
for this wonderful life

37:24.507 --> 37:25.942
and this beautiful night.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.611
- Right.
- Cheers.

37:27.744 --> 37:29.079
Cheers!

37:29.213 --> 37:31.282
- Cheers!
- We're toasting.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.351
Cheers.

37:34.483 --> 37:36.252
Cheers.

37:36.385 --> 37:37.954
Cheers.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.758
Cheers.

37:53.702 --> 37:57.742
I couldn't agree more.
I am not into weddings.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.911
I'd like to be alone.

38:01.043 --> 38:04.014
Tell me about it.
Crowds are awful.

38:09.219 --> 38:11.822
Okay, I can take one
for the team

38:11.954 --> 38:12.822
and drink them both.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.963
You know
how at every wedding,

38:21.097 --> 38:22.798
there's always
a few single people

38:22.932 --> 38:24.668
pretending not to care
they're single.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.637
Well, um,
we're those people.

38:29.472 --> 38:30.841
It's weird, right?

38:30.974 --> 38:34.443
I'm, uh, divorced.
What's your story?

38:34.577 --> 38:38.783
Get away from me.

38:41.184 --> 38:42.687
Okay.

and continue this party!

39:47.717 --> 39:49.586
I can't talk to you
about this right now.

39:49.719 --> 39:50.721
Dad!

39:50.853 --> 39:52.422
Oscar! The fireworks!

39:52.556 --> 39:55.559
I'm... Isabel, I'm gonna
call you tomorrow.

40:43.907 --> 40:45.175
Oh, my gosh.

41:38.628 --> 41:40.297
I didn't know.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.666
I didn't know it was her.

42:03.318 --> 42:05.021
<i>Let's see what they got us.</i>

42:05.155 --> 42:06.323
- Just two lines.
- Ooh.

42:06.456 --> 42:07.657
"Here's to the year.

42:07.791 --> 42:10.427
Here's to an extra special
anniversary."

42:10.561 --> 42:13.263
- I think it's a blanket?
- Maybe.

42:13.396 --> 42:15.998
- What do you think?
- I think it's a tablecloth.

42:16.132 --> 42:17.701
Oh, yeah?
I think it's a cape.

42:17.833 --> 42:19.702
- Yeah.
- Whatever, it's nice.

42:19.836 --> 42:23.005
- It's a cape, right?
- It's from one of our lawyers.

42:23.139 --> 42:24.842
- Sorry.
- Does it have a return receipt?

42:24.974 --> 42:26.976
Might be a matching hat
in there.

42:27.110 --> 42:29.346
- Somebody's at the door.
- Hold on.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.215
- Anything else in there?
- No, just some of this.

42:39.889 --> 42:41.692
Please come in.

42:49.699 --> 42:51.802
Wait here, okay?

42:51.934 --> 42:54.304
I'm gonna do something with it.
I'm gonna go.

42:54.436 --> 42:57.106
Should we start with
the flamingos or start...?

42:57.239 --> 42:58.808
- Hey.
- Gonna go with this.

42:58.943 --> 43:02.580
Who made this?
Did you make this?

43:04.213 --> 43:06.482
Hi.

43:06.615 --> 43:08.985
- Hi.
- Isabel, right?

43:10.519 --> 43:11.922
Thank you for coming
yesterday.

43:12.054 --> 43:13.757
Thanks for having me.

43:13.889 --> 43:15.925
- I told you I would call you.
- But you didn't.

43:16.059 --> 43:17.560
Can I get you something
to drink?

43:17.693 --> 43:18.896
No.

43:19.028 --> 43:20.630
- Why don't we show you around?
- Yeah.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.932
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

43:23.065 --> 43:26.135
Keep opening presents. Otherwise
we'll be here all week.

43:35.378 --> 43:36.545
Okay.

43:36.679 --> 43:38.581
What do you want?

43:38.715 --> 43:41.284
I want to know
why my daughter...

43:41.416 --> 43:42.552
is in the other room.

43:47.891 --> 43:50.159
How do you live
with yourself?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.632
A lot more easily
than if I had left her

43:55.764 --> 43:57.000
with someone else to raise.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.168
So how did that
even happen?

44:00.302 --> 44:03.839
Because... Because we decided
that we couldn't keep the baby.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.975
- No, no, you decided.
- No, you agreed.

44:06.108 --> 44:09.645
- Mm. No, no, no. I was a kid.
- Exactly.

44:09.780 --> 44:12.548
We decided to give her up
for adoption

44:12.681 --> 44:15.984
because we decided
that was the best thing for her.

44:16.119 --> 44:18.722
- We tried to find you. We...
- No, you didn't. You didn't.

44:18.855 --> 44:21.324
If you'd wanted to find me,
you could have found me.

44:21.458 --> 44:25.161
- You wanted to be the hero.
- Oh, don't talk to her like that!

44:25.295 --> 44:28.130
You didn't want to be found.
You ran the second they let you

44:28.264 --> 44:30.133
- out of the hospital.
- You're right I did.

44:30.266 --> 44:32.868
You know how painful that
decision was. You were there.

44:33.001 --> 44:35.471
I don't remember
it being that hard.

44:35.605 --> 44:37.106
Or if it was,
you didn't tell me.

44:37.239 --> 44:39.475
You just shut down.
You turned into some zombie.

44:39.608 --> 44:42.045
That gives you the right
to raise her behind my back

44:42.179 --> 44:44.280
because I was conflicted
about being a mother

44:44.414 --> 44:46.548
- when I was 18 years old?
- You went crazy.

44:46.682 --> 44:49.518
One second, telling me what
a great life we were gonna have,

44:49.652 --> 44:51.221
the next, how you wanted
to kill yourself.

44:51.353 --> 44:52.288
I never said that.

44:52.422 --> 44:53.657
- You did.
- I never said that!

44:53.791 --> 44:55.726
- You said it to my face!
- I never said that!

44:55.858 --> 44:58.828
All right, all right, calm down.
Please, quiet.

45:01.197 --> 45:02.864
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:02.998 --> 45:05.234
Come on.
It's all good.

45:06.501 --> 45:08.337
Please don't do that.

45:18.181 --> 45:20.617
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna keep her?

45:28.056 --> 45:30.159
I didn't know
until after you were gone,

45:30.293 --> 45:32.561
and by then,
it was too late.

45:32.695 --> 45:35.099
And I... I couldn't find you.

45:38.202 --> 45:39.870
I'm not gonna justify myself
to you.

45:40.003 --> 45:43.506
I don't owe you anything.

45:43.639 --> 45:45.775
You tell her or I will.

46:43.932 --> 46:47.137
At every moment, I made
the best decision that I could.

46:47.269 --> 46:49.105
It was very complicated,
Grace.

46:49.237 --> 46:51.673
- You just don't understand.
- No, you're fucking right.

46:51.807 --> 46:54.577
- I don't understand.
- Don't curse at me.

46:54.710 --> 46:57.647
It was a lot to manage.
I did my best.

46:57.780 --> 47:03.653
And this story
just kind of developed.

47:05.121 --> 47:07.489
Do you think that
I made it up on purpose?

47:07.623 --> 47:09.826
I didn't want you to know
your mom gave you up,

47:09.960 --> 47:11.662
so I told you
that she died.

47:12.829 --> 47:15.364
Can you not
understand that?

47:15.498 --> 47:19.335
A little girl. I didn't want you
to feel that hurt and that pain.

47:19.469 --> 47:21.338
You don't think that
I feel that anyway?

47:21.471 --> 47:25.876
You don't think
that I feel incomplete?

47:26.009 --> 47:27.876
You had no right
to do what you did,

47:28.010 --> 47:31.213
and it is not my job to make
you feel better about it.

47:31.347 --> 47:32.983
And I won't.

47:34.182 --> 47:35.818
What hotel?

47:51.802 --> 47:54.204
Are you sure
you want to do this?

47:56.838 --> 47:59.242
You already have
a really great mom.

48:00.510 --> 48:02.778
Grace, I...
I just mean...

48:04.347 --> 48:06.115
I'll wait for you.

49:10.445 --> 49:12.748
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:14.449 --> 49:16.519
Come in. Please.

49:29.231 --> 49:30.967
Can I...?

49:31.099 --> 49:33.302
Get you something to drink?
We have everything.

49:34.936 --> 49:37.139
Yeah, okay. Um...

49:37.273 --> 49:39.075
I'll take that.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.610
You know what,
I have a glass.

49:47.250 --> 49:49.652
My dad said
that you were dead.

49:52.121 --> 49:53.023
Well, I'm not.

49:55.224 --> 49:56.492
Yeah.

50:00.896 --> 50:02.431
Thanks.

50:06.034 --> 50:07.702
What's this...? Taste like?

50:07.836 --> 50:10.239
Mm.

50:10.373 --> 50:13.175
It's like fancy orange soda,
I guess.

50:18.179 --> 50:19.915
Have a sip.

50:20.817 --> 50:22.184
Okay.

50:29.659 --> 50:31.094
Mm.

50:31.994 --> 50:33.529
It's sweet.

50:35.630 --> 50:37.733
You don't have this
in India?

50:37.867 --> 50:40.303
Mm. No, we have, um...

50:40.436 --> 50:41.504
Artos.

50:41.637 --> 50:44.474
But not so much
at the orphanage.

50:46.708 --> 50:48.411
I have so many questions.

50:56.219 --> 50:58.354
How long are you here for?

50:58.487 --> 51:00.589
- Do you have time to meet?
- Yeah, of course.

51:00.722 --> 51:03.092
- I'd love that.
- Okay.

51:04.293 --> 51:07.163
Um, I can...
I can call you.

51:07.297 --> 51:08.563
Now that I know you exist.

51:08.697 --> 51:11.467
I can... I can call you too.

51:11.601 --> 51:12.936
Yeah.

51:16.606 --> 51:18.608
- Do...? Do you have a phone?
- Yeah.

51:36.793 --> 51:38.161
Great.

51:39.929 --> 51:41.364
Okay.

51:41.496 --> 51:44.299
I should go because
Jonathan's waiting for me.

51:44.434 --> 51:45.802
Okay.

51:51.072 --> 51:52.541
Okay.

51:55.844 --> 51:57.646
See you.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.983
- Okay.
- Oh, let me get that for you.

52:03.353 --> 52:05.055
- See you.
- Bye.

52:21.403 --> 52:24.340
I want you to lead
the meditation when I'm gone.

52:25.474 --> 52:26.643
Would you like that?

52:26.775 --> 52:28.878
You can show the others
how it's done?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.282
Come on,
I can teach you.

52:34.817 --> 52:36.885
It's easy. Look.

52:37.018 --> 52:38.554
Just close your eyes.

52:42.724 --> 52:43.925
Close your eyes.

52:44.059 --> 52:45.461
There.

52:47.262 --> 52:49.331
See, now,
but they're not really closed.

52:49.465 --> 52:51.334
<i>They're looking
on the inside of you,</i>

52:51.467 --> 52:53.769
<i>and only you can see that.</i>

52:54.903 --> 52:57.474
I-I see the dark.

52:57.606 --> 52:58.675
No, no, really look.

52:58.807 --> 53:01.344
You can see everyone
that you love.

53:02.811 --> 53:05.514
And then
with your imagination,

53:05.648 --> 53:08.951
you can create anything.

53:09.085 --> 53:11.186
And then do you hear
the-the drum? The:

53:15.224 --> 53:17.760
That... That is not a drum.

53:17.893 --> 53:19.429
No? What's that?

53:19.561 --> 53:21.697
That's my heart.

53:28.070 --> 53:30.774
I thought this place
might remind you of home.

53:31.740 --> 53:33.108
That was probably stupid.

53:33.242 --> 53:35.211
No, it was thoughtful.

53:35.344 --> 53:37.579
Jonathan took me here
on one of our first dates.

53:37.713 --> 53:40.517
It seemed exotic then.

53:41.483 --> 53:44.253
You two seem very happy.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.655
Yeah.

53:46.789 --> 53:48.658
To tell you the truth,
it's kind of hard

53:48.791 --> 53:51.059
to think straight
about anything right now.

53:51.193 --> 53:52.828
Yeah, I know what you mean.

53:52.961 --> 53:54.097
Some chutney.

53:54.230 --> 53:55.831
Thank you.

54:01.570 --> 54:06.041
So do I have any brothers
or sisters I don't know about?

54:06.175 --> 54:10.513
No. Well... There is this one
little boy at the orphanage

54:10.646 --> 54:12.248
that I've
pretty much raised.

54:12.380 --> 54:15.117
We found him by the side
of the road when he was just 1.

54:16.284 --> 54:17.586
How old is he now?

54:17.719 --> 54:20.122
Eight next week.

54:21.257 --> 54:23.459
- Jai.
- Jai.

54:23.592 --> 54:25.996
He loves birds.

54:26.128 --> 54:27.563
And he...

54:27.697 --> 54:29.766
He wants to be
a professional football player

54:29.898 --> 54:31.233
when he grows up.

54:31.367 --> 54:32.402
Soccer, you mean.

54:32.534 --> 54:34.068
Soccer!

54:34.202 --> 54:35.672
Yes.

54:37.806 --> 54:40.342
I brought some photos with me
if you want to see them.

54:40.476 --> 54:42.744
- I would love that.
- Okay.

54:44.146 --> 54:45.081
Here.

54:46.782 --> 54:48.385
Okay.

54:48.518 --> 54:50.420
Let's see.

54:52.922 --> 54:56.425
So, um,
that's when we went to a ranch,

54:56.559 --> 54:58.094
in the summer.

54:58.226 --> 55:00.763
Cute. Such a cute kid.

55:06.369 --> 55:09.072
Oh, we built a snow fort
in the backyard.

55:09.204 --> 55:11.240
That's a
terrified little reindeer.

55:11.373 --> 55:12.509
Yeah.

55:17.679 --> 55:19.382
- Ah.
- Oh, yeah.

55:20.449 --> 55:21.717
That was my birthday.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.353
I'm decorating cupcakes.

55:23.485 --> 55:24.621
- Fun.
- Yeah.

55:36.699 --> 55:38.802
I don't think
that I could give up a baby.

55:48.010 --> 55:50.613
It wasn't in my plans
either.

55:52.414 --> 55:54.483
I just knew
I couldn't take care of you

55:54.617 --> 55:56.786
and that bringing you
into the world

55:56.918 --> 55:58.288
was the best
that I could do.

56:10.132 --> 56:12.902
That was the
first day of third grade.

56:13.034 --> 56:14.703
Wow.

57:33.215 --> 57:35.284
Cibele,
there was a nest in my closet.

57:35.416 --> 57:37.119
- Did you move it?
- A nest?

57:37.253 --> 57:38.855
A bird's nest
with little blue eggs.

57:38.987 --> 57:40.455
- Did you move it?
- No, no.

57:40.588 --> 57:42.190
- I didn't see that.
- You... All right.

57:42.324 --> 57:43.960
I do appreciate the interest,

57:44.092 --> 57:45.927
but I think
I'm gonna hang on to the AP.

57:46.061 --> 57:48.431
But I'm happy to show you
new stuff I'm working on.

57:48.565 --> 57:51.267
And that's cool. But Jamey
is willing to pay secondary

57:51.400 --> 57:53.501
if we could figure out
something not totally...

57:53.635 --> 57:55.237
- Hey.
- Theresa. Jamey, Andre.

57:55.371 --> 57:56.639
They're looking
at new stuff.

57:56.771 --> 57:59.007
Did you take that
from me?

57:59.141 --> 58:00.777
Oh, yeah.
I found it in your closet.

58:00.909 --> 58:02.411
What were you doing
in my closet?

58:02.543 --> 58:04.612
I was replacing a light bulb.
The nest looked

58:04.746 --> 58:06.248
like it was falling apart.
I was gonna repair it.

58:06.382 --> 58:07.849
You don't have to fix
everything.

58:07.983 --> 58:09.451
You're not the handyman.

58:15.724 --> 58:17.159
Downside to
working at home.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.929
I'll show you a sketch
of the stuff I'm working on.

58:21.463 --> 58:22.664
I want to revisit that.

58:22.797 --> 58:24.032
- We will.
- All right.

58:38.347 --> 58:40.716
Oh, good.

58:40.849 --> 58:42.585
Sit down.

58:42.717 --> 58:44.319
I'm celebrating.

58:44.452 --> 58:46.422
I officially sold
my company.

58:46.554 --> 58:49.024
- Can we have two more, please?
- Of course, Miss Young.

58:49.157 --> 58:51.993
- Uh, no, thank you.
- You don't drink?

58:52.128 --> 58:54.097
Uh, not in the middle
of the day, no.

58:54.230 --> 58:57.398
Not at the wedding either.
Oscar said that you guys

58:57.532 --> 58:59.868
partied a lot back in the day.
Is that why?

59:02.771 --> 59:05.708
Theresa? Just wanted to stop by
and say congratulations.

59:05.842 --> 59:08.478
- Heard you made out pretty well.
- Is that a surprise?

59:08.610 --> 59:12.681
Now I'm just a very, very,
very rich employee.

59:14.717 --> 59:17.820
This is my friend, Isabel.
This is Richard and Eddie.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.688
I'm about to donate
a small fortune

59:19.822 --> 59:22.425
to the orphanage
Isabel runs in India.

59:22.557 --> 59:23.826
Wow.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.327
Now I feel bad about myself.

59:25.460 --> 59:26.429
Well, it's about time.

59:28.197 --> 59:31.434
- Congratulations again.
- Nice to see you. Thanks.

59:32.702 --> 59:36.606
I assumed,
after the other night,

59:36.739 --> 59:39.141
- that that was no longer...
- It makes more sense now.

59:39.275 --> 59:40.909
We're practically family.

59:41.043 --> 59:42.611
- We'll have the sole.
- Mm-hm.

59:42.744 --> 59:44.746
- You'll love it.
- Thank you.

59:46.748 --> 59:49.451
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I want to.

59:49.585 --> 59:51.119
Why can't you just
be grateful?

59:51.253 --> 59:54.222
Because I know when things
seem too good to be true.

59:54.356 --> 59:56.625
I think the only thing
you need to know

59:56.757 --> 59:58.093
is what to do
with the money.

59:58.226 --> 01:00:01.396
So it's a good day.
A good day for both of us.

01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:04.766
Was it strange
to see Oscar again?

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.637
You know, I mean,
does he look different now?

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.239
I...

01:00:11.572 --> 01:00:13.708
I don't remember.

01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:15.443
Come on. I mean, he's...

01:00:15.577 --> 01:00:19.047
He's a good-looking man now,
but back then,

01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:21.451
he must've really been
something.

01:00:23.351 --> 01:00:24.753
You knew who I was

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.955
when you invited me
to come here, didn't you?

01:00:27.088 --> 01:00:29.490
No, I did not.

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.793
All I knew
is what my people told me,

01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:33.996
that there was a good
charitable opportunity.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.164
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:40.269
What do you want?

01:00:41.903 --> 01:00:44.440
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.
- Oh, then why are you?

01:00:44.572 --> 01:00:45.873
You have
your conference call.

01:00:46.007 --> 01:00:48.043
I tried texting,
but you weren't responding.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.846
Well, I'm not available now,
so push the call.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.115
You specifically asked
to schedule for Monday.

01:00:53.248 --> 01:00:56.117
Jesus Christ. Do I work for you,
or do you work for me?

01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:58.887
- Which one is it?
- I work for you.

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:01.690
Yes, you work for me.
So push the fucking call.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.827
If you can't, don't come in
tomorrow. Thank you.

01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:09.931
I'm sorry.
God, I'm so sorry about that.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.202
Grace told me
that you two had dinner,

01:01:14.335 --> 01:01:18.106
and I just wanted to say
that I'm glad that's happening.

01:01:37.059 --> 01:01:38.527
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:38.659 --> 01:01:41.163
- Gwen dropped these off for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.164
She also wanted to see
if you're okay.

01:01:43.298 --> 01:01:45.101
Yeah, fine.

01:01:47.369 --> 01:01:51.074
I decided to go ahead
and finance Isabel's orphanage.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.879
You gonna say anything?

01:01:58.713 --> 01:02:01.549
I'm sure she'll be very happy
about it.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:04.753
- You're perfect for each other.
- What?

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.689
I said,
you're perfect for each other.

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:08.356
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.193
She didn't seem
that grateful either.

01:02:14.195 --> 01:02:16.864
I'm gonna assume
that this is the vodka talking.

01:02:16.998 --> 01:02:18.032
Good solution.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:20.902
No responsibility
that way.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:30.880
You know you're not the only
one affected by this, right?

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.953
Just don't go up
to the boys' room like this.

01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:39.821
Don't tell me
what to do.

01:02:39.954 --> 01:02:41.590
And don't tell me
how to be a mother

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:44.327
'cause it's not like
you're the better parent.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.228
And I'm sick and tired

01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:50.732
of that single-dad story
you keep telling

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.569
because you didn't do it
on your own.

01:03:43.684 --> 01:03:45.987
<i>Hi. I want to apologize.</i>

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:48.790
I was awful.
Hope I didn't scare you.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.561
- Oh, it takes more than that.
- Please.

01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:54.896
Can you tell them
I'm gonna be 15 minutes late?

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.364
Sure.

01:04:01.036 --> 01:04:03.338
Um, ahem...

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.240
I have decided
to amend my offer.

01:04:05.373 --> 01:04:08.476
I'd like to make it
significantly more generous.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:11.213
Um, it will require you
to stay a few more days

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.148
while the details
are being worked out.

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.984
No, I can't stay.
I have to get home.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.885
I understand, but circumstances
have changed, and...

01:04:18.019 --> 01:04:21.690
I think this is too important
to be a one-off donation.

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.692
Obviously,
it means a lot to me

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.561
that you're Grace's
biological mother,

01:04:25.693 --> 01:04:30.132
so I have talked to my lawyers
about establishing a fund.

01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:32.333
It would be in both
your and Grace's name.

01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:33.835
You would run it together.

01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:36.570
And I was thinking
20 million over six years.

01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:38.873
From the research I did,

01:04:39.007 --> 01:04:41.076
that would cover
50,000 kids a year.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:44.179
For medication,
education or housing,

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:45.381
whatever you need,

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:48.751
including
the local farming thing.

01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:52.020
What's in it for you?

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:56.590
Wow. Wow.

01:04:56.724 --> 01:04:58.226
Just stay.
Just stay a little bit

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.394
so we can work out
the details.

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:03.298
You can spend time with Grace,
get to know her better.

01:05:03.431 --> 01:05:05.567
I'm gonna take my boys to D.C.
for the weekend

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:09.505
to see my sister,
so why don't you...?

01:05:09.637 --> 01:05:11.773
Why don't you go out there
while I'm gone?

01:05:13.007 --> 01:05:13.942
Talk to Oscar.

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:20.081
I'm sure you have a lot
to talk about.

01:05:23.418 --> 01:05:25.119
- Is my dad in there?
- He's on the path.

01:05:25.253 --> 01:05:26.255
- He's on the trail?
- Yes.

01:05:26.387 --> 01:05:28.190
Okay. Thank you.

01:05:57.619 --> 01:05:58.821
Dad!

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:04.327
What are you doing out here?

01:06:07.795 --> 01:06:08.964
I was just thinking.

01:06:10.065 --> 01:06:12.268
I hate
fighting with you.

01:06:17.371 --> 01:06:20.408
You think
you're ever gonna forgive me?

01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:24.646
What's my other option?

01:06:28.382 --> 01:06:30.318
But I want to know
everything.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.929
When you give a child up
for adoption,

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.865
you've got 30 days
to change your mind.

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:49.738
A grace period.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:56.579
How long did it take you
to decide to come get me?

01:06:59.347 --> 01:07:01.250
Twenty-nine days.

01:07:03.684 --> 01:07:05.487
We agreed

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.691
that once you were born,
we would both leave.

01:07:10.025 --> 01:07:12.894
She kept her end
of the bargain,

01:07:13.027 --> 01:07:15.463
and I meant to,

01:07:15.597 --> 01:07:18.567
but I thought
I would just...

01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:24.240
Yeah, go over
and visit you for an hour.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.175
And then
I couldn't stop going.

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.678
Just staring at you...

01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:32.581
talking to you.

01:07:35.115 --> 01:07:36.585
So...

01:07:37.952 --> 01:07:41.590
did you marry Mom
for my sake?

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:44.192
- So that I'd have a mother?
- No.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:47.228
I married her
because I loved her.

01:07:49.197 --> 01:07:50.632
Do you?

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.369
I do.

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:01.210
I'm sorry, Gracie.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.820
You think you're
strong enough to get this?

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:12.219
Yeah.

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:14.389
- This is heavy.
- Yeah, because of the shoes.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:15.891
You need
lots and lots of shoes

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:17.725
when you're visiting
so many museums.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:19.060
- No!
- No, I'm kidding.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:20.795
- Maximum, three.
- Please, don't.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.765
- Still, that's too many.
- Hey, guys,

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.934
- the snacks are in the back.
- Okay, and just...

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.100
Put it in the back
and then jump in the car.

01:08:27.234 --> 01:08:28.536
I don't want to hit traffic.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:30.238
- Bye, Dad.
- Take the train?

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.374
Then you don't have to worry
about traffic.

01:08:32.506 --> 01:08:34.876
- Or crashing.
- No, I want to drive.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.278
I like to be alone
with them

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.081
because they talk to you
in the car.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:42.417
See? I'm listening,
even when you think I'm not.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:43.886
- Say hi to your sister.
- I will.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.287
- Be careful.
- Yeah, of course.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.622
I'm gonna be careful.
Of course.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:51.426
Hey, hey, shorties! Let me
give you a hand. Here you go.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:15.551
Hi.

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:24.158
So...

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:25.760
do you know
about this fund

01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:28.127
that Theresa asked me
to administer?

01:09:28.261 --> 01:09:29.697
That's what you came for,
right?

01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:32.635
With Grace?
I'd run it with Grace?

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.337
I don't even think
that Grace knows.

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:39.340
I don't know if it's real.
I don't know...

01:09:39.474 --> 01:09:41.676
To be honest with you,
I don't trust your wife.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.044
You don't trust my wife?

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:44.613
She's gonna give you money
for your charity

01:09:44.746 --> 01:09:46.546
and you're gonna question
her integrity?

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.884
Twenty million dollars?

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:58.093
Is it real?

01:09:58.225 --> 01:10:00.595
You don't have to be poor
to have good intentions.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:03.065
There are people with money
and principles, okay?

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.534
Really? That's not
what I remember you saying

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:07.035
- when I knew you.
- That's because

01:10:07.168 --> 01:10:08.569
I was an idiotic idealist.

01:10:08.703 --> 01:10:10.338
But I grew up.

01:10:11.672 --> 01:10:12.675
Did you?

01:10:14.242 --> 01:10:15.578
No.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:21.482
Theresa doesn't care
about the orphanage.

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.052
She doesn't wanna
talk about it.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:24.653
She's interested
in business.

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:26.555
So, what does she want?

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:32.327
Give Grace some direction?
I don't know.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.163
I don't know. I don't know.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.368
Appears to be a running theme
for me these days.

01:10:47.475 --> 01:10:49.345
Well, join the club.

01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:57.987
I looked at your work
online.

01:11:01.789 --> 01:11:03.224
Yeah?

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:05.594
Yeah. It's...

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.430
really bad.

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.740
How do you choose?

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:23.745
Can't describe it, really.

01:11:23.878 --> 01:11:26.480
Can't or don't want to?

01:11:26.613 --> 01:11:28.582
Both.

01:11:28.716 --> 01:11:30.286
Fair enough.

01:11:39.293 --> 01:11:42.297
Certain rocks
kind of glow to me.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.502
Like an aura?

01:11:51.439 --> 01:11:53.008
Maybe.

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:57.645
So then those are
the ones you take?

01:11:58.746 --> 01:12:01.382
Not at first, no.

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:04.351
I leave them there,

01:12:04.485 --> 01:12:07.122
and then I go back.

01:12:09.623 --> 01:12:11.559
And if it's still...

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:14.362
lighting up,

01:12:14.494 --> 01:12:16.564
then I take them.

01:12:20.201 --> 01:12:21.502
Is that what happened?

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:27.975
With Grace?
She was lighting up?

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.804
Are you gonna meet us at Nobu,

01:14:02.936 --> 01:14:04.672
or you want to come
by the office?

01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:06.240
For what?

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.775
For dinner.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.945
With Ben and Xandy.

01:14:11.979 --> 01:14:14.015
What are you doing?

01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:17.585
Is that India?

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.855
Yeah. I thought we could go.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.757
When?

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.125
Uh, for our honeymoon.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.860
They're supposed
to have great hotels.

01:14:26.994 --> 01:14:28.496
We're going to
Costa Rica.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.331
- I want to surf.
- Oh.

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:33.168
Yeah, I know, I know,
but maybe we could do both.

01:14:33.301 --> 01:14:34.269
Uh...

01:14:34.402 --> 01:14:36.136
India's too far, babe.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.972
I can't take that much time
off work.

01:14:38.105 --> 01:14:40.340
We just said we were
gonna be gone for a week.

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:44.012
Maybe you could go for a week,
and I could stay for longer.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.948
So you want to be alone
in India?

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:51.019
Because I think you...
You hate being alone.

01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:53.621
Well, I won't be alone.
I'll be with Isabel.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.925
Yeah.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:59.261
I know.
I'm not stupid.

01:15:00.328 --> 01:15:02.196
Why are you being
so shitty?

01:15:02.329 --> 01:15:03.398
Me?

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:06.734
Grace,
how do you think it feels

01:15:06.868 --> 01:15:08.136
to get married to somebody,

01:15:08.269 --> 01:15:09.972
and then a week later,
have them turn

01:15:10.104 --> 01:15:12.906
- into a different person?
- Uh...

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.810
Did you just think I was gonna
stay the same forever?

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.813
Jesus Christ,
that's not what I'm saying.

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:19.180
What are you saying?

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:21.048
That you can't just
change things now.

01:15:21.181 --> 01:15:22.684
She gave you up.

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:30.391
I'm sorry.

01:15:30.524 --> 01:15:32.493
I got to go, okay?

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:00.882
<i>Aardvark? Good one.</i>

01:17:01.015 --> 01:17:02.818
- No, it's your turn.
- Cheetah.

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:05.118
- Yeah, that's good.
- Lion.

01:17:05.252 --> 01:17:07.320
Uh-huh. Uh... Deer.

01:17:07.454 --> 01:17:09.356
Uh, camel. Heh.

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:10.858
Octopus.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:13.595
That... Does an octopus count
as an animal?

01:17:13.728 --> 01:17:16.197
- Uh... kind... Yeah!
- Okay. All right.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.166
- It's a sea creature.
- Otter. I say otter.

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:19.634
Otter? Shark.

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:21.168
Dog.

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:22.336
Chicken.

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:23.871
Uh, crocodile.

01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:25.306
- Panther.
- Okay.

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:27.142
All right, guys.

01:17:28.743 --> 01:17:30.511
Dad! Daddy!

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.380
Hi, baby. Hey, hey, hey!

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.948
Oh, wow.

01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:35.217
Daddy,
look what we won.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.518
- They're huge.
- They're huge, right?

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:39.186
- Yeah.
- How did you win these?

01:17:39.319 --> 01:17:42.523
There was a lovely go-kart track
off the highway,

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.292
and they had carnival games.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:47.629
Mom said the games were a waste
of time, so she bought them.

01:17:47.761 --> 01:17:50.030
It smelled like feet
and hot dogs in there,

01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:51.698
and I wanted
to beat the traffic.

01:17:51.832 --> 01:17:53.233
Thanks, George Washington.

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:56.171
Hey, you guys, go upstairs
and take a bath. Okay?

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.573
And then afterwards,
you can play one video game.

01:17:58.706 --> 01:17:59.807
- Can we pick?
- Can we pick?

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.408
Daddy's gonna pick, okay?

01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:03.377
Go upstairs
and wash those stinky feet.

01:18:03.511 --> 01:18:05.345
- Okay.
- Will you take this upstairs?

01:18:05.479 --> 01:18:06.814
I have to run
into the office.

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.717
- I will be back for dinner.
- Hey, wait...

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.151
All right?

01:18:10.284 --> 01:18:12.319
I talked to your doctor.

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.658
You've known about this
for three months?

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:20.295
She spoke to you?

01:18:20.427 --> 01:18:22.197
Yeah.

01:18:22.329 --> 01:18:24.666
That's a breach of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.801
- I could sue her.
- She figured I already knew

01:18:26.934 --> 01:18:30.037
because you promised her
you'd tell me after the wedding.

01:18:30.171 --> 01:18:32.740
I don't have time
for this right now.

01:18:32.873 --> 01:18:35.743
Theresa.
Honey, we have to talk

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.212
- about this.
- No. No, we...

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.347
- Yeah, yeah.
- I have nothing to talk about.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.250
- We have to talk about this.
- Let me go. I've to get to work.

01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:43.684
Let you go?
I'm your husband!

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.320
I'm never gonna let you go!

01:18:50.557 --> 01:18:52.327
Don't tell Grace
and the boys.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.563
- Baby...
- Don't tell them.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.235
- We'll figure something out.
- I have figured it out.

01:19:02.369 --> 01:19:04.872
There's got to be some kind
of experimental treatment

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.740
- or testing...
- There's not. I've looked.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.409
Nothing. There's nothing
that wouldn't just prolong it

01:19:09.543 --> 01:19:10.744
or make it worse.

01:19:10.877 --> 01:19:12.479
I don't want you
to see me that way,

01:19:12.613 --> 01:19:14.916
and I don't want them
to see me that way.

01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:17.385
So you just want me
to do nothing.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:20.122
We don't get to choose.
Let me go.

01:19:37.203 --> 01:19:39.806
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.278

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:46.614

01:19:55.288 --> 01:19:56.157
Tell them I said:

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.127
<i>Isabel,</i>

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.930
<i>you're doing something
important.</i>

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.030
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:20:04.164 --> 01:20:05.500
Bye.

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:12.506
So there are a couple
of points I don't understand.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.910
Okay. Let's see.

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:23.284
If you and Grace can't agree
on how funds are distributed,

01:20:23.417 --> 01:20:24.919
Oscar gets
a tie-breaking vote.

01:20:25.052 --> 01:20:26.953
I thought it'd be better
if it wasn't me.

01:20:27.087 --> 01:20:28.621
Yeah, no. Not that. This.

01:20:28.756 --> 01:20:32.327
It says I have to live
in New York?

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.595
But your cost of living
will be taken care of.

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.463
I can just come in
for board meetings.

01:20:36.597 --> 01:20:38.198
I can do the rest
on Skype.

01:20:38.332 --> 01:20:39.835
I'm afraid
it's a requirement.

01:20:39.967 --> 01:20:43.671
Yeah, but that doesn't make
any sense. Why?

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:46.374
Because you're used to
running things at the orphanage,

01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:49.275
but you're not accustomed
to managing millions of dollars,

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.046
so I would like you here.

01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:05.826
I'll do six months here
and six there.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.296
It's nonnegotiable.

01:21:08.429 --> 01:21:11.632
Please don't... Don't waste
our time pretending

01:21:11.765 --> 01:21:14.534
that you're not
gonna do this.

01:21:14.668 --> 01:21:16.604
You think I give a shit
about your money?

01:21:16.737 --> 01:21:18.538
- Yes, I do.
- You think I'm for sale?

01:21:18.672 --> 01:21:20.774
- You wanna buy me?
- No, I don't want to buy you,

01:21:20.908 --> 01:21:22.376
I wanna give you
an opportunity.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.945
Bullshit!

01:21:25.078 --> 01:21:26.280
That's what it says here.

01:21:26.413 --> 01:21:28.349
Call it whatever you want.
I don't care.

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:30.685
Just think about
what you can do with the money

01:21:30.818 --> 01:21:32.253
and all the kids
you could help.

01:21:32.386 --> 01:21:34.221
I know you'd sell yourself
for that.

01:21:34.354 --> 01:21:35.422
You don't know me.

01:21:35.555 --> 01:21:37.358
Actually, I do.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.760
Thirty-nine years old.
Born in Troy, New York.

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.863
Raised in Connecticut
by adoptive parents.

01:21:41.996 --> 01:21:43.597
You went to boarding school
upstate.

01:21:43.731 --> 01:21:45.599
Went to Syracuse for a year,
dropped out.

01:21:45.733 --> 01:21:47.268
Joined the Peace Corps.
Met Oscar.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.603
You're a good person.
You're well-intentioned.

01:21:49.737 --> 01:21:51.907
You're an idealist.
You're just like Grace.

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.943
I have a life.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.878
Your life will be good here,
I promise.

01:21:58.011 --> 01:22:00.747
I have a good life there!
You think because you're rich,

01:22:00.881 --> 01:22:04.384
I'm gonna get down on my knees
and lick your asshole?

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:06.988
And you think because
you're a do-gooder, it makes up

01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:09.757
for the fact that
you abandoned your child, right?

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.560
Isabel!

01:22:46.694 --> 01:22:48.162
Isabel, I'm sorry!

01:22:48.295 --> 01:22:49.663
I'm so, so sorry.

01:22:49.796 --> 01:22:51.598
Who do you think you are?
You're cruel.

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.301
She's your daughter.
She needs you.

01:22:53.434 --> 01:22:55.735
And she needs you here,
and Oscar needs you here.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:57.938
- You're crazy!
- No. No, I'm sick.

01:22:58.072 --> 01:23:00.574
I'm... I'm sick. I'm dying.

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:06.581
I didn't bring you here
just to give you money.

01:23:08.248 --> 01:23:09.516
What?

01:23:10.717 --> 01:23:12.686
My boys are 8 years old.

01:23:16.623 --> 01:23:18.158
Help me.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.030
Please.

01:23:23.497 --> 01:23:25.165
Help me.

01:23:25.298 --> 01:23:28.636
Do I have to be halfway around
the world to get your help?

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:03.203
Grace.

01:24:03.337 --> 01:24:04.572
Can I talk to you?

01:24:04.704 --> 01:24:06.240
Yeah, of course.

01:24:12.979 --> 01:24:15.382
<i>Have you told
your parents how you feel?</i>

01:24:16.649 --> 01:24:18.519
No, I can't.

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:21.189
They thought I was too young
to get married.

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:22.690
They were right.

01:24:24.358 --> 01:24:27.095
God,
I wish I wasn't married.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.498
Can you tell me what to do?

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:36.737
- No, Grace, I can't.
- Please.

01:24:36.869 --> 01:24:39.606
Everyone's gonna hate me
if I get divorced, but I don't...

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:42.010
I don't know
if I can stay married.

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.922
It's your life.

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:57.525
You decide.

01:25:01.862 --> 01:25:02.896
Like you did?

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.438
Did you even think
about what you were doing to me?

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.613
I'm sorry.

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:25.586
I'm sorry.

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:33.628
It's okay.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.196
It's okay.

01:25:35.328 --> 01:25:37.030
I'm here.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:07.060
- <i>Hello.</i>
- It's Isabel.

01:26:07.194 --> 01:26:08.828
<i>Isabel.</i>

01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:11.532
<i>Did we get the money?</i>

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:12.900
Yes.

01:26:13.033 --> 01:26:14.702
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:16.904
<i>Let me get Jai.
We'll celebrate!</i>

01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:18.838
No, no, no.

01:26:18.971 --> 01:26:21.041
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:26:26.212 --> 01:26:28.715
I'm, uh...

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:34.355
Not... I'm not coming back.
I'm staying in New York.

01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:37.292

For how long?</i>

01:26:38.958 --> 01:26:43.797
<i>♪ Out into the playground

01:26:45.432 --> 01:26:48.135

01:26:48.268 --> 01:26:49.904
Hey.

01:26:50.037 --> 01:26:52.238
Is she okay?

01:26:52.372 --> 01:26:53.875
She's upset.

01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:56.811
And confused.

01:26:56.944 --> 01:27:00.048
And she feels
like she's made a mistake.

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:06.086
What'd you tell her?

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.590
I told her
that it was her life.

01:27:09.722 --> 01:27:12.092
Thank you for
letting her stay with you.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.101
Gracie.

01:27:21.234 --> 01:27:22.436
You're gonna be okay.

01:27:29.009 --> 01:27:29.877
Hey, sleepyhead.

01:27:32.845 --> 01:27:34.548
This is really weird.

01:27:38.284 --> 01:27:39.586
Oh, sure, have some.

01:27:41.021 --> 01:27:42.789
I'll get some more.

01:27:42.922 --> 01:27:44.123
Do you want one, Dad?

01:27:44.257 --> 01:27:46.993
Yeah, thanks.

01:27:47.127 --> 01:27:49.931
Why don't you see
if they have some pastries too?

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:55.970
She's so sensitive.

01:27:57.537 --> 01:28:00.274
Oscar, you have to tell her
about Theresa.

01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:09.784
I... I really...
I don't want to...

01:28:11.051 --> 01:28:12.953
I don't want to hurt her.

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:20.328
They're bringing
the pastries over.

01:28:38.078 --> 01:28:39.913
Thank you.

01:28:40.046 --> 01:28:41.081
Theresa,

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:42.917
your turn.

01:28:55.729 --> 01:28:58.531
Well, it's official.

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:00.100
I have a lot less money.

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:02.169
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:29:02.302 --> 01:29:05.872
Thank you, everyone.
Thanks so much.

01:29:07.006 --> 01:29:08.509
All right.

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.679
You're changing
a lot of people's lives.

01:29:11.813 --> 01:29:14.449
I hope you do
everything you want with it.

01:29:16.283 --> 01:29:17.985
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

01:29:18.118 --> 01:29:19.485
- Grace is here.
- Oh.

01:29:19.619 --> 01:29:22.023
I wasn't expecting her.
Send her in.

01:29:22.155 --> 01:29:24.658
- I'll just start that 12:30.
- That'd be great.

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.994
Isabel,
you can stay.

01:29:27.127 --> 01:29:29.330
I don't think
she's here to see me.

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.382
Hi, sweetheart. I wish
I'd known you were coming.

01:29:48.515 --> 01:29:51.051
I would have cleared myself
for lunch...

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.288
Why didn't you tell me?

01:29:57.891 --> 01:30:00.293
Why didn't you
tell me yourself?

01:30:03.096 --> 01:30:06.300
You were lying every minute
you knew and didn't tell me.

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:09.302
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to make you sad.

01:30:09.436 --> 01:30:12.072
You didn't think I'd be sad
if you just died one day?

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:13.975
- No.
- What?

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.645
I didn't want anything
to change.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.583
Maybe I was wrong.

01:30:27.587 --> 01:30:29.755
If I knew
that you were dying,

01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:32.260
I wouldn't have spent my time
doing other stuff.

01:30:33.927 --> 01:30:37.864
It's okay. Okay. It's okay.
You'll be okay.

01:30:37.998 --> 01:30:39.699
No, I don't want to be okay.

01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:42.202
Okay.
Isabel will be here.

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.738
- She'll be here.
- I don't care about Isabel.

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:47.039
I care about you.

01:30:47.173 --> 01:30:49.576
You're my mom, and I...

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.145
If you don't tell me,
I can't...

01:30:51.278 --> 01:30:53.646
I can't tell you all the things
that I want to say.

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.149
What do you want to say?

01:30:56.917 --> 01:30:59.053
I can't tell you that I...

01:30:59.185 --> 01:31:01.621
- That I love you.
- I know you do.

01:31:01.755 --> 01:31:02.890
I love you.

01:31:06.226 --> 01:31:08.127
I don't want you to die.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.216
This pair always gives me
trouble.

01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:04.018
Oh, yeah.

01:32:15.194 --> 01:32:16.896
I love being needed.

01:32:17.029 --> 01:32:19.233
It makes me horny.

01:32:23.837 --> 01:32:25.038
One more second.

01:32:25.171 --> 01:32:27.541
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

01:32:31.744 --> 01:32:32.846
<i>Dance party?</i>

01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:34.747
Ooh. I love to dance.

01:32:34.881 --> 01:32:36.115
Mom, this is serious.

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.951
Get out of the way!

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.686
It's serious. Oh, sorry.
I'll do some serious dancing.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.189
<i>So there are not many people</i>

01:32:43.323 --> 01:32:46.993
<i>who have the power
and tenacity</i>

01:32:47.127 --> 01:32:49.496
<i>to will their vision
into existence</i>

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.097
and in the process,

01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:52.899
change the way
our industry works.

01:32:53.033 --> 01:32:55.335
Not to mention employing
over 1000 people

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.369
and raising a family

01:32:56.503 --> 01:32:57.371
and, oh, yeah,

01:32:57.503 --> 01:32:58.838
making a shit-ton of money.

01:32:58.971 --> 01:33:01.108
Yeah, that's right.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.244
So why sell
when you have built

01:33:04.377 --> 01:33:06.447
this big, thriving behemoth
of a company?

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.282
- Why?
- That's what I want to know.

01:33:08.414 --> 01:33:09.783
- Thank you. Right.
- No.

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.786
Why? Why? Why?

01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:14.253
- Why? Why? Why?
- Theresa, why?

01:33:14.387 --> 01:33:16.724
Okay, so she did say
it is because

01:33:16.856 --> 01:33:18.692
she likes beginnings.

01:33:18.826 --> 01:33:22.229
And a little bit of hardship.

01:33:22.362 --> 01:33:25.198
And when things get too easy
for her, she gets bored.

01:33:25.332 --> 01:33:26.566
We bored her.

01:33:26.699 --> 01:33:27.701
You said it,
I didn't.

01:33:30.337 --> 01:33:33.874
So congratulations, Theresa.
You know we love you,

01:33:34.007 --> 01:33:35.975
and we can't wait to see
what you do next.

01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:38.912
To Theresa.
For bringing us all together.

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:40.981
Cheers!

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:13.380
Just to be clear, my birthday's
not until next month,

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.349
but thank you
for being here

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.886
and thank you
for this extraordinary cake.

01:34:19.019 --> 01:34:21.288
- Did you make this, babe?
- Yeah, I did.

01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:23.524
Your work is generally
more abstract than this

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:26.393
and it's pretty figurative.
It's a real departure for you.

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:27.828
First time working
with cake.

01:34:30.029 --> 01:34:33.199
As you know,
Oscar is a brilliant artist.

01:34:33.332 --> 01:34:37.003
I always thought that artists
were flaky and impractical,

01:34:37.136 --> 01:34:39.372
and I never expected
to fall in love with one.

01:34:39.506 --> 01:34:40.541
I thought I was...

01:34:40.673 --> 01:34:43.042
I was gonna meet
a nice banker,

01:34:43.176 --> 01:34:45.845
but it turns out,
there are no nice bankers.

01:34:48.815 --> 01:34:51.117
Oh, do you know what he said
to me in the car

01:34:51.251 --> 01:34:53.453
on the way here?

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.523
He said:

01:34:56.957 --> 01:35:00.027
"Is it us moving
through the world,

01:35:00.159 --> 01:35:02.863
or the world
running past us?"

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.835
To which I said...

01:35:11.171 --> 01:35:12.739
"Let's not take
the Northern State.

01:35:12.872 --> 01:35:15.074
Traffic's terrible
at this time."

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:17.878
Um, but this is...

01:35:18.011 --> 01:35:19.379
This is not about...

01:35:19.512 --> 01:35:23.248
Not about me and my family.
This is about us

01:35:23.382 --> 01:35:26.252
and what we have accomplished
together, which is a lot.

01:35:26.386 --> 01:35:28.255
And I know
that many people are wondering

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.257
what this company
is gonna look like now,

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:32.526
and I would be lying to you
if I didn't say

01:35:32.658 --> 01:35:34.927
that there would be
a period of transition.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.197
But if you say to yourself:

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:39.432
"I feel uncomfortable,"

01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:40.900
then good.

01:35:41.034 --> 01:35:45.439
Because discomfort
brings growth.

I forgot to tell you the...

01:36:17.136 --> 01:36:18.804
- The school called...
- Yeah?

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:21.242
To suggest
that we split the boys

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:24.979
into separate classes
after the winter break.

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:27.815
They think it might be good
for their confidence.

01:36:32.485 --> 01:36:34.688
I just worry about that...

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.489
That one teacher, Janet.

01:36:36.622 --> 01:36:39.092
She's a little melancholy
for third grade.

01:36:39.225 --> 01:36:41.295
Why are you
telling me this?

01:36:43.262 --> 01:36:45.832
You okay? Let me get you
a painkiller, all right?

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:47.534
No. No.

01:36:47.667 --> 01:36:52.005
I want to know why you're
telling me this about the boys.

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:54.240
Because
we have to decide.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:58.244
No, we don't have to decide
anything. You have to decide.

01:37:00.579 --> 01:37:04.251
It's all done.
I did everything I could.

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.820
But there's always
gonna be more to do,

01:37:06.953 --> 01:37:09.523
and you're gonna have
to do it.

01:37:09.655 --> 01:37:11.826
Because I'm not
gonna be here.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:22.203
I won't.
I won't be here.

01:37:28.007 --> 01:37:30.010
You think you'll be with her
when I'm gone?

01:37:30.143 --> 01:37:31.010
Stop.

01:37:31.144 --> 01:37:32.311
No, I want to know.

01:37:32.444 --> 01:37:34.648
Baby, I love you.

01:37:43.689 --> 01:37:45.558
Where do you go?

01:37:49.462 --> 01:37:51.331
You know,
where will I...?

01:37:51.463 --> 01:37:53.266
Where will I go?

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.170
I don't know.

01:37:59.072 --> 01:38:01.007
I don't want to die.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.945
I don't want to die.

01:38:06.078 --> 01:38:07.947
I don't...

01:38:08.081 --> 01:38:11.018
I don't want to die.

01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.385
I don't want to.

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.056
I'm not done!

01:38:17.756 --> 01:38:21.728
- I'm not done! I'm not done!
- I know. I know, I know.

01:38:21.862 --> 01:38:24.198
I'm not done!

01:38:25.931 --> 01:38:28.967
I know. I know.

01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:31.037
I know you're not.

01:38:32.005 --> 01:38:34.207
I know.

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.610
I'm with you, baby.
I'm with you.

01:38:36.743 --> 01:38:38.312
I'm with you.

01:41:09.061 --> 01:41:10.096
Isabel.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.903
So good to see you.

01:41:17.703 --> 01:41:19.404
Come.

01:41:21.006 --> 01:41:22.574
Okay. Come in.

01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:24.577
- Come in.
- You come with me.

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:27.448
So excited to show you
all the improvements we've made.

01:41:38.323 --> 01:41:40.559
Jai! Guess who's here?

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.800
- Miss Isabel!
- Jai!

01:41:46.932 --> 01:41:48.635
Oh, I missed you!

01:41:48.768 --> 01:41:51.137
I missed you too.

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:52.471
- Miss Isabel?
- What?

01:41:52.605 --> 01:41:54.073
- Come.
- What?

01:41:54.207 --> 01:41:55.809
What is it?

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.279
Look.
A bird's nest.

01:42:00.413 --> 01:42:01.914
Oh, amazing.

01:42:02.047 --> 01:42:04.518
- I watched the mother feed them.
- Really?

01:42:04.650 --> 01:42:05.952
What'd she feed them?

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.355
Lentils? No?

01:42:08.488 --> 01:42:09.689
Vindaloo?

01:42:09.822 --> 01:42:11.091
No, Miss Isabel.

01:42:11.224 --> 01:42:12.092
Worms.

01:42:12.225 --> 01:42:14.495
Oh, worms. Yuck.

01:42:17.296 --> 01:42:19.532
Jai, I want to ask you
something.

01:42:23.668 --> 01:42:26.172
How would you like to come back
with me to New York?

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:31.677
To live.

01:42:34.514 --> 01:42:35.782
No.

01:42:40.686 --> 01:42:43.556
I will miss my friends.

01:42:43.689 --> 01:42:47.226
The thing is,
is that I have to live there.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.030
So then we wouldn't be able
to see each other as much.

01:42:53.432 --> 01:42:55.569
You can come and visit.

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.672
Yeah, I can.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:04.845
Jai, come!

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.847
Come on, Jai!

01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:10.350
You want to go play?

01:43:10.483 --> 01:43:11.818
