01:54.842 --> 01:55.876
Dan.

01:58.542 --> 01:59.409
Dan wake up.

02:02.909 --> 02:04.442
Oh, Dan.

04:15.609 --> 04:16.442
Stop it!

04:17.875 --> 04:18.709
Thank you.

05:12.442 --> 05:16.709
It's not what.

05:46.275 --> 05:48.509
Should've
locked the door.

06:17.275 --> 06:17.976
Oh, geez.

06:31.242 --> 06:32.208
Fuck!

06:50.242 --> 06:51.275
Bastard!

07:49.375 --> 07:50.308
Anita.

07:50.342 --> 07:51.642
There you are.

07:51.676 --> 07:53.942
Almost forgot what
you look like.

07:53.976 --> 07:54.809
Huggers?

07:59.742 --> 08:00.742
That was rude.

08:00.776 --> 08:02.676
- Smoke inside?
- Of course not!

08:16.375 --> 08:17.542
This your home?

08:17.575 --> 08:19.375
- My husband's home.
- Husband!

08:22.409 --> 08:23.509
That real?

08:23.542 --> 08:24.375
Yes.

08:26.308 --> 08:27.375
Mother of fuck.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.542
He's well off.

08:31.308 --> 08:32.241
Or his family was.

08:32.275 --> 08:33.174
He's a lecturer.

08:34.342 --> 08:35.207
Adorable.

08:36.009 --> 08:36.842
How long?

08:38.009 --> 08:39.976
Three years, five
years together.

08:40.009 --> 08:41.808
No, I mean, how
long you been out?

08:43.542 --> 08:44.575
Five years.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.275
Jumped right into
it, didn't you?

08:48.308 --> 08:49.342
Kids?

08:52.642 --> 08:53.776
Adorable.

08:53.809 --> 08:57.375
We like to do
outdoorsy stuff, okay?

08:57.409 --> 08:58.776
That sounds retarded.

08:58.809 --> 08:59.742
Did you tell him about me?

08:59.776 --> 09:01.208
- Of course!
- Liar.

09:01.242 --> 09:01.842
On our first date, I did.

09:01.876 --> 09:02.842
What did he say?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.409
- He was understanding.
- Hmm.

09:05.842 --> 09:07.275
And his name is Dan?

09:07.308 --> 09:07.909
Yes!

09:07.942 --> 09:09.242
Dan the man.

09:09.275 --> 09:12.642
- Just Dan!
- Just Dan, adorable.

09:12.676 --> 09:14.842
Why are you being so
aggressive, darling?

09:14.876 --> 09:15.809
Darling?

09:15.842 --> 09:17.208
- Why-
- Because you never call.

09:17.242 --> 09:18.575
The phone works
both ways, darling.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.308
Suppose you're right.

09:27.342 --> 09:28.375
Tea?

09:29.409 --> 09:30.909
With scotch in it.

09:30.942 --> 09:31.776
Lovely.

09:44.609 --> 09:45.876
Dan said it's a good one.

09:50.542 --> 09:52.342
It's all the same
once it's in your gut.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.575
Now, now, darling, don't sulk.

09:54.609 --> 09:56.242
I should've called,
I'm very sorry,

09:56.275 --> 09:58.676
but the important thing is
that we are here now, isn't it?

09:58.709 --> 09:59.842
Suppose.

09:59.876 --> 10:01.175
Don't suppose.

10:02.509 --> 10:03.342
Know.

10:04.776 --> 10:06.742
Yeah, I know.

10:07.742 --> 10:08.575
Good.

10:11.676 --> 10:12.842
So, what is it, Catherine?

10:12.876 --> 10:13.709
What's what?

10:15.342 --> 10:16.442
Why did you call me?

10:19.542 --> 10:20.342
Of course.

10:27.375 --> 10:29.242
I caught Dan watching it again.

10:29.275 --> 10:29.909
What's it?

10:33.542 --> 10:38.542
Pook, por...

10:40.475 --> 10:41.509
pornography.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.175
The worst kind of pornography.

10:46.409 --> 10:48.409
He promised me he'd stopped.

10:48.442 --> 10:49.976
He went to counseling.

10:50.009 --> 10:51.509
What good is working
on your illegally

10:51.542 --> 10:53.409
libidinous shortcomings
if you're not making

10:53.442 --> 10:55.776
a lifetime commitment
to destroying them?

10:57.409 --> 10:58.842
It was the middle of the night.

10:58.876 --> 11:00.308
His office door was closed

11:00.342 --> 11:02.442
and there was that
glow under the door,

11:02.475 --> 11:04.275
so I went to look
through my peephole.

11:04.308 --> 11:05.442
Peephole?

11:05.475 --> 11:06.275
Mm hmm.

11:06.308 --> 11:07.242
He was on his laptop.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.442
And that means?

11:08.475 --> 11:10.375
Dan, of course!

11:10.409 --> 11:12.542
Door closed, laptop on,
three in the morning.

11:12.575 --> 11:13.375
But how do you-

11:13.409 --> 11:14.475
Because I just know!

11:16.409 --> 11:18.509
Well, go ahead, just judge
away, Anita, judge away.

11:22.909 --> 11:24.509
So what the fuck happened?

11:26.542 --> 11:28.475
What do you mean what happened?

11:28.509 --> 11:29.909
Do I have to spell
it out for you?

11:29.942 --> 11:31.342
I caught him watching it again,

11:31.375 --> 11:33.409
and so I stabbed him in
the side of the head.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.342
What?

11:34.375 --> 11:35.475
Right into the temporal lobe.

11:35.509 --> 11:37.509
- Is he dead?
- Yes!

11:37.542 --> 11:38.409
I imagine he is.

11:39.342 --> 11:40.642
What, you ain't sure?

11:40.676 --> 11:42.242
Well, I mean, if he's
not at the moment,

11:42.275 --> 11:44.409
I can't imagine that
he'll last much longer.

11:45.509 --> 11:46.642
Where the bloody hell is he?

11:46.676 --> 11:48.909
Upstairs, in the closet.

11:50.676 --> 11:51.776
Like you.

11:51.809 --> 11:53.742
No, not like me.

11:53.776 --> 11:55.542
I'm not in the closet.

11:56.475 --> 11:59.475
He is literally in the closet.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.342
Fucking bambino Jesus Christo!

12:18.542 --> 12:19.942
That's a dead man.

12:19.976 --> 12:21.375
Appears so, doesn't it?

12:21.409 --> 12:23.575
You gave him the death sentence.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.742
Affirmative.

12:24.776 --> 12:27.342
No, I mean, shit.

12:28.009 --> 12:30.275
I mean.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.242
What are you doing?

12:36.275 --> 12:38.308
MJ, gotta do the MJ.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.275
MJ gets my head right.

12:40.308 --> 12:41.208
Would you like a cigarette?

12:41.242 --> 12:42.809
Oh, yeah, that would be fun.

12:54.308 --> 12:54.909
Dan.

12:59.942 --> 13:00.909
Catherine.

13:02.575 --> 13:03.409
Hi.

13:12.575 --> 13:13.409
Sorry.

13:16.909 --> 13:19.976
I'm really sorry I'm so late.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.709
I just arrived myself.

13:21.742 --> 13:23.642
I had this lecture,
and it just ran over.

13:23.676 --> 13:25.542
- I would've called-
- No apologies necessary.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.575
I absolutely understand.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.542
When I was a student,
my long-winded essays

13:30.575 --> 13:31.909
most likely kept teachers late.

13:33.475 --> 13:34.742
Meaning that I get it.

13:35.942 --> 13:38.609
Well, I mean, you
know, if your essays

13:38.642 --> 13:40.542
were half as poetic
as your emails,

13:40.575 --> 13:43.809
I think that the teachers would
delight in their overtime.

13:50.642 --> 13:51.876
Do you bring all
of your dates here?

13:51.909 --> 13:55.509
All of my dates.

13:55.542 --> 13:58.542
Ah, no, no.

14:00.342 --> 14:02.208
I don't date very much.

14:02.909 --> 14:03.742
Work is...

14:04.909 --> 14:06.475
I work too much
for casual dating,

14:06.509 --> 14:09.308
so, you know, I'm
new to all of this,

14:09.342 --> 14:13.175
and, in fact, I
have a confession.

14:14.342 --> 14:15.175
What?

14:17.475 --> 14:19.575
I've never been on an
online date before.

14:23.842 --> 14:25.642
What?

14:25.676 --> 14:26.509
Nothing.

14:28.642 --> 14:29.676
All right.

14:30.609 --> 14:35.575
Well, I'm not one to interrogate
a woman on a first date.

14:37.308 --> 14:38.676
Okay.

14:38.709 --> 14:41.375
I didn't tell you
everything online,

14:41.409 --> 14:44.575
but I was very
honest in my profile

14:44.609 --> 14:47.809
when I said that I'd
never been on a, um.

14:47.842 --> 14:49.542
Been on an online date.

14:50.776 --> 14:55.342
No, not just an online date.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.342
I've never been on a date.

15:01.308 --> 15:02.175
You're kidding.

15:03.009 --> 15:03.842
No.

15:04.776 --> 15:06.542
You've never been on a date?

15:07.409 --> 15:08.242
Never.

15:11.676 --> 15:12.876
What a crime.

15:18.676 --> 15:21.842
Thank you for the compliment.

15:21.876 --> 15:22.676
It's okay.

15:22.709 --> 15:24.375
But it is true.

15:25.375 --> 15:29.842
This is my first time
sitting across from a man.

15:29.876 --> 15:31.509
- A man.
- In any type

15:31.542 --> 15:34.542
of romantic setting that
might lead to romance,

15:35.475 --> 15:38.475
you know, something,
if you were to like me.

16:09.308 --> 16:11.876
I need you to go to the
store and get a bow saw.

16:11.909 --> 16:12.976
A bow saw?

16:13.009 --> 16:14.642
A pink one, if you can find it.

16:14.676 --> 16:15.575
Hell.

16:15.609 --> 16:16.709
We need to dismember him.

16:16.742 --> 16:17.542
Shit.

16:17.575 --> 16:18.575
Dismember and burn him.

16:18.609 --> 16:19.709
Fuck.

16:19.742 --> 16:20.709
Then hose the place down.

16:21.909 --> 16:24.809
Speaking of, after you
go to the bow saw store,

16:24.842 --> 16:25.909
I need you to go
to another store

16:25.942 --> 16:27.609
and get some cleaning supplies.

16:27.642 --> 16:30.208
Bin bags, bleach, sponges.

16:30.242 --> 16:31.642
A bow saw at one store.

16:31.676 --> 16:32.876
Cleaning supplies at the other.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.609
To avoid suspicion.

16:34.642 --> 16:35.642
Obviously.

16:35.676 --> 16:36.709
Obviously.

16:39.475 --> 16:40.308
You coming with?

16:41.409 --> 16:42.876
I can't, I'm known in town.

16:43.876 --> 16:45.509
Of course.

16:45.542 --> 16:46.909
Of course.

16:46.942 --> 16:48.709
But nobody knows me.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.208
Correct.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.609
Correct.

16:58.275 --> 16:59.509
That's why you called me.

17:00.742 --> 17:02.776
I'm your undercover scummer.

17:40.442 --> 17:42.175
What have you been
saying, Mother?

17:48.642 --> 17:52.342
Catherine, my name is
Dr. Charmaine Johnson,

17:52.375 --> 17:55.409
and I'd like to ask you a
few questions, all right?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.342
By all means, Charmaine.

18:02.509 --> 18:04.242
Do you know why you're here?

18:05.976 --> 18:07.909
Do you blame your mother?

18:07.942 --> 18:09.709
I blame her for
ratting on Anita.

18:11.609 --> 18:14.475
Look, I don't cause trouble.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.542
I do all my chores.

18:17.575 --> 18:18.842
A model teenager.

18:18.876 --> 18:20.976
The girl talks to herself.

18:21.009 --> 18:22.842
And you know she hardly eats,

18:22.876 --> 18:26.776
and, when she does eat, she
just giggles with Anita,

18:26.809 --> 18:28.909
giggles at the carrots,
giggles at the potatoes,

18:28.942 --> 18:30.642
giggles at the
whole bloody stew.

18:30.676 --> 18:31.942
- May I?
- Talking with Anita,

18:31.976 --> 18:33.575
- giggling with Anita.
- May I?

18:33.609 --> 18:34.809
Anita, Anita,
Anita, fucking Anita

18:34.842 --> 18:36.275
the past fucking eight years.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.909
May I interject?

18:44.308 --> 18:45.876
Go ahead, Catherine.

18:45.909 --> 18:47.342
- All the children-
- Betty-

18:47.375 --> 18:48.609
- In our street-
- Give Catherine

18:48.642 --> 18:49.809
room to respond.

18:50.942 --> 18:52.275
Thank you, Charmaine.

18:54.809 --> 18:56.809
I simply don't care
what Mother thinks.

18:58.442 --> 19:01.676
My life with Anita is one
of balance and dignity.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.308
It's not my fault she's
threatened by her.

19:06.342 --> 19:08.876
I'm just happy to spend
time with my friend.

19:08.909 --> 19:10.809
Wanna
swing on the swings?

19:11.809 --> 19:16.842
Oh, my darling Kit Kat,
you are a laughingstock.

19:16.876 --> 19:20.742
I'm not a laughingstock,
Mother, and it's Catherine.

19:20.776 --> 19:23.742
Yes, you are, Kit Kat.

19:23.776 --> 19:24.609
I'm not.

19:25.509 --> 19:26.609
I'm special.

19:28.509 --> 19:30.609
And I don't mean
special in the way

19:30.642 --> 19:32.909
in which one refers to a retard,

19:32.942 --> 19:36.676
out of some abstract concept
of respecting what we pity.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.842
I'm literally special.

19:52.909 --> 19:57.909
Catherine, Detective
Reese will be joining us.

19:58.442 --> 19:59.275
Nothing to be afraid of.

20:13.475 --> 20:14.676
Shit!

20:24.842 --> 20:25.609
Oh, dear.

20:31.976 --> 20:33.909
Okay, let's go.

20:41.609 --> 20:42.809
Fuck.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.542
How are you this evening?

21:17.575 --> 21:18.942
Yeah, wonderful.

21:18.976 --> 21:20.242
Yeah.

21:20.275 --> 21:22.175
So, what can I get you?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.076
Red?

21:26.109 --> 21:27.876
What's the nicest
red that you have?

21:27.909 --> 21:28.709
For red, I'd recommend-

21:28.742 --> 21:29.575
No!

21:30.909 --> 21:33.709
No, thank you, I
just don't drink.

21:35.909 --> 21:37.509
I take things that won't work.

21:37.542 --> 21:38.809
You feel free to drink.

21:39.876 --> 21:40.776
I'm not an alcoholic
or anything,

21:40.809 --> 21:43.275
so it's not like I'll salivate

21:43.308 --> 21:44.809
like a hungry rat if I see it.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.442
We're okay, thank you.

21:55.742 --> 21:57.442
You really could
have ordered it.

21:57.475 --> 21:58.742
No, no, no.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.976
I agree, I think that it's best

22:01.009 --> 22:03.308
for people to meet under
the eyes of sobriety.

22:09.976 --> 22:11.742
Fuck.

22:11.776 --> 22:13.776
It's like welcome to
dead house in here.

22:15.642 --> 22:16.742
Tick tock, darling.

22:42.876 --> 22:44.475
Lovely.

22:48.809 --> 22:49.742
Fab.

22:53.409 --> 22:54.676
Good thinking, Anita,
we're obviously

22:54.709 --> 22:57.175
gonna need more than one.

22:57.942 --> 22:59.308
Did you hear that?

23:00.642 --> 23:01.842
Did anyone follow you?

23:03.242 --> 23:04.375
What's that?

23:04.409 --> 23:05.509
What?

23:05.542 --> 23:06.976
That.

23:08.942 --> 23:11.709
Fuck, Dan's back from the dead!

23:11.742 --> 23:13.208
Pull yourself together!

23:16.676 --> 23:17.509
Pink!

23:19.676 --> 23:20.509
God.

23:22.342 --> 23:23.342
Need help?

23:24.275 --> 23:26.275
Oh, for the love of...

23:28.709 --> 23:30.242
I got it.

23:30.275 --> 23:31.308
Okay.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.876
Hello, sweetheart.

24:16.876 --> 24:17.942
Nice bow saw.

24:20.009 --> 24:22.742
I'm sorry I'm running late,
I had to take a detour,

24:22.776 --> 24:26.275
but I think you're
gonna really like it.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.542
Nice cast.

25:35.942 --> 25:37.442
I learned from the best.

25:52.308 --> 25:54.442
Hey, hey.

26:43.976 --> 26:45.242
What was it?

26:46.809 --> 26:47.642
Nothing.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.175
Was it Dan?

26:52.809 --> 26:53.642
Dan the man?

26:57.509 --> 26:58.942
What's wrong?

26:58.976 --> 26:59.876
Nothing.

27:03.742 --> 27:06.242
You are surprisingly
good at this, Anita.

27:11.475 --> 27:13.709
Did you ever get over your
fear of being touched?

27:13.742 --> 27:15.375
Not the
back of the neck.

27:17.275 --> 27:19.242
Did your girlfriends
respect your boundaries?

27:19.275 --> 27:20.475
The last one didn't.

27:20.509 --> 27:22.442
She got drunk and
grabbed my neck.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.409
And she knew you couldn't
be touched there?

27:26.842 --> 27:28.375
And she did it regardless?

27:29.976 --> 27:33.575
Now that you're back, I
won't let anybody harm you,

27:33.609 --> 27:34.742
just like the old days.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.542
That's why you called me, right?

27:40.575 --> 27:41.409
Called you?

27:42.542 --> 27:45.542
Yeah, you want me to off her.

27:45.575 --> 27:46.409
Off who?

27:47.676 --> 27:49.208
Your ex-girlfriend.

27:49.242 --> 27:49.942
Catherine.

27:49.976 --> 27:51.509
What?

27:51.542 --> 27:52.942
You called me.

27:52.976 --> 27:54.275
What?

27:54.308 --> 27:55.509
You called me up.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.275
Are you demented?

27:57.308 --> 27:58.475
You called me up.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.575
You called me 'cause you
wanted me to help you-

28:00.609 --> 28:02.308
I was in a happy marriage.

28:02.342 --> 28:03.642
I didn't need you showing up

28:03.676 --> 28:05.409
and ruining it all for me again.

28:17.909 --> 28:21.308
Terribly sorry, darling, I
don't know what came over me.

28:24.509 --> 28:26.642
Catherine, maybe you
should call the police.

28:26.676 --> 28:28.242
Call the police, Catherine.

28:28.275 --> 28:29.475
I'm not going to do that.

28:31.542 --> 28:32.442
You need help.

28:32.475 --> 28:33.442
I'm not calling the police.

28:33.475 --> 28:35.375
Are you fucking crazy?

28:35.409 --> 28:36.909
Crime of passion.

28:36.942 --> 28:38.475
Crime of passion, my ass.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.575
You're funny, Anita.

28:44.509 --> 28:46.642
Now help me bag this bastard up.

28:59.442 --> 29:00.542
Honey, I'm home.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.676
Look at me, Dan.

29:16.809 --> 29:18.275
I bared my soul to you,

29:19.275 --> 29:21.842
every single dark crevice,
and you've kept this from me.

29:27.275 --> 29:28.442
I trusted you.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.842
I didn't know how I should-

29:38.542 --> 29:39.876
I want children, Dan.

29:43.342 --> 29:44.175
So do I.

29:45.475 --> 29:48.275
How can we with this history?

29:49.742 --> 29:50.942
What?

29:50.976 --> 29:52.509
What are you talking about?

29:57.842 --> 30:00.842
I am so sorry, I will never,
ever, ever, ever do this again.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.208
Please.

30:04.542 --> 30:06.308
You need help.

30:36.809 --> 30:39.542
Do I have
to be here for this?

30:40.942 --> 30:42.275
For a girl who loves goosebumps,

30:42.308 --> 30:43.642
you sure are queasy, darling.

30:53.509 --> 30:55.409
You better double-bag it.

31:17.242 --> 31:17.876
Oh, not now.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.509
There are three ways to
kill a fish in angling.

31:29.542 --> 31:32.409
One is you cut their throat.

31:32.442 --> 31:35.175
You go in here and cut the
blood vessels to the gills.

31:36.409 --> 31:40.375
Or you can hit it on
the head, like this.

31:40.409 --> 31:42.842
Or you can
brain-spike them here.

31:44.275 --> 31:45.809
I find the brain-spike
to be the kindest way

31:45.842 --> 31:47.909
to send them to fishy heaven.

31:47.942 --> 31:49.609
Look away if you're
squeamish, princess.

32:07.542 --> 32:08.676
I'm a monster.

32:13.909 --> 32:15.609
He's the monster, if you ask me.

32:19.642 --> 32:20.642
Thank you.

32:42.709 --> 32:44.542
So you're feeling a
bit under the weather, eh?

32:45.409 --> 32:46.575
What?

32:46.609 --> 32:49.342
Sick, I mean, are
you sick, are you on?

32:49.375 --> 32:50.609
Sick?

32:50.642 --> 32:52.375
Yeah, because you
said you're taking,

32:52.409 --> 32:55.275
- that's why you can't.
- Oh, because I said

32:55.308 --> 32:57.509
- I was taking-
- Yeah.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.342
Yes.

32:59.609 --> 33:02.809
No, I'm not sick.

33:02.842 --> 33:05.709
What?

33:05.742 --> 33:07.876
I was sick.

33:07.909 --> 33:08.909
I'm not anymore.

33:16.742 --> 33:20.409
Okay,

33:20.442 --> 33:22.642
Say that we like each other.

33:22.676 --> 33:25.342
- Uh huh.
- And we become a couple.

33:25.375 --> 33:28.375
Oh.

33:28.409 --> 33:29.742
You are on the site because you

33:29.776 --> 33:31.676
want to be in a relationship?

33:31.709 --> 33:32.742
That I am.

33:33.575 --> 33:35.909
Cool, good.

33:35.942 --> 33:39.308
So we both wanna be
in relationships.

33:39.342 --> 33:42.709
And once you're
in a relationship,

33:44.509 --> 33:47.409
you find out these
things about your partner

33:47.442 --> 33:49.575
that maybe they're
hiding early on

33:49.609 --> 33:51.542
so as not to scare
the other person off

33:51.575 --> 33:53.809
and be left in the dust.

33:55.509 --> 33:56.308
Right?

33:57.575 --> 33:58.876
That is how relationships
work, right?

33:59.742 --> 34:01.509
Yes.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.676
Yes, I guess.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.609
What's so funny?

34:08.375 --> 34:09.208
You.

34:10.442 --> 34:11.809
Why are you laughing at me?

34:11.842 --> 34:13.876
Oh, my God, no, no,
no, oh, I'm so sorry.

34:13.909 --> 34:18.742
No, I'm not laughing at
you, I'm laughing with you.

34:20.509 --> 34:21.342
With me?

34:22.775 --> 34:25.775
I don't understand,
I'm not laughing.

34:25.809 --> 34:28.208
I was trying to be honest with
you about something personal.

34:28.242 --> 34:29.542
Yeah, yeah.

34:31.775 --> 34:34.308
I think, you know,
when someone says

34:34.342 --> 34:35.641
they're laughing with you,

34:37.242 --> 34:40.342
what they're trying to
say is they like you.

34:42.842 --> 34:43.876
Oh.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.242
I didn't know that.

34:49.976 --> 34:50.942
Do you like me?

34:52.842 --> 34:54.475
Yeah, yeah.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.308
I think you're very funny

34:57.342 --> 35:02.208
and, yeah, I like you.

35:03.542 --> 35:04.375
Yay.

35:05.509 --> 35:06.542
You like me.

35:09.876 --> 35:12.275
So, anyway, would you like
to hear what's wrong with me?

35:12.308 --> 35:13.375
Yeah, sure.

35:17.308 --> 35:18.676
Yeah, yeah, that's
exactly right.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.275
I'm completely at a loss.

35:22.709 --> 35:23.909
I know.

35:23.942 --> 35:25.275
Listen, I'm ashamed,

35:25.308 --> 35:27.342
I'm ashamed that I
haven't called earlier.

35:28.742 --> 35:30.909
Yeah, well, I thought
that I could do it myself.

35:33.909 --> 35:38.375
Yeah, well, I'm feeling
pretty scared right now.

35:38.409 --> 35:41.909
Listen, I've tried,
but she just won't.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.842
Who are you talking to?

35:53.942 --> 35:55.776
Who are you talking to?

35:55.809 --> 35:56.809
Catherine!

35:59.242 --> 36:00.409
Is that him?

36:00.442 --> 36:01.275
Parts of him.

36:03.742 --> 36:05.342
Did you clean his office?

36:05.375 --> 36:06.809
- Yeah.
- Hardwood floors?

36:06.842 --> 36:07.942
- Yeah.
- Closet?

36:07.976 --> 36:09.942
- Cleaned.
- Good girl.

36:09.976 --> 36:11.976
Now, who the fuck are
you talking to, darling?

36:12.009 --> 36:13.475
You asked me here to help.

36:13.509 --> 36:14.842
Do you call that helping?

36:16.575 --> 36:19.442
Seriously, Anita, when did
you become so demented?

36:19.475 --> 36:20.742
You know what they'll do to me.

36:20.776 --> 36:21.976
They'll send me
back there again,

36:22.009 --> 36:23.642
and, this time, they
won't ever let me out.

36:23.676 --> 36:24.475
Is that what you want?

36:24.509 --> 36:25.342
No!

36:26.509 --> 36:28.842
This is batshit
crazy, Catherine.

36:28.876 --> 36:31.442
You have a short memory
of what that actually is.

36:32.308 --> 36:33.842
Now go and start a fire!

36:33.876 --> 36:34.776
Catherine, I really-

36:34.809 --> 36:36.876
We are not calling the police!

36:49.809 --> 36:51.275
Where the hell were you?

36:51.308 --> 36:52.575
Being grilled by this one.

36:52.609 --> 36:53.809
You've confessed?

36:53.842 --> 36:55.509
Yeah, told them
I did everything.

36:55.542 --> 36:56.442
Good girl.

36:56.475 --> 36:57.942
Catherine.

36:57.976 --> 36:59.409
What?

36:59.442 --> 37:00.842
My name is Detective Reese.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.442
I know you've been
through a lot tonight.

37:10.442 --> 37:13.575
I know, I'm trying.

37:14.742 --> 37:15.842
Knock it off, Anita.

37:16.976 --> 37:19.842
Catherine, why do you
think you're here?

37:21.575 --> 37:24.842
Listen, Detective
Reese, my grades

37:24.876 --> 37:26.742
are of the highest merit,

37:26.776 --> 37:30.342
I don't smoke,
drink, or take drugs,

37:30.375 --> 37:35.375
and I'm still a
virgin, so, please,

37:36.776 --> 37:39.308
tell me where the
problem exists.

37:39.342 --> 37:43.175
Now, if you'd be so kind
as to let us return home,

37:43.942 --> 37:45.642
Anita and I are
writing a novella.

37:47.442 --> 37:48.275
A novella?

37:49.375 --> 37:50.275
That's exciting.

37:52.575 --> 37:53.409
What's it about?

37:54.776 --> 37:56.809
It's about an all-mighty girl

37:56.842 --> 37:57.909
who can change into a zebra

37:57.942 --> 38:00.575
when her human father sneaks
into her room at night.

38:01.676 --> 38:03.308
It's based on your family.

38:03.342 --> 38:05.242
Is that okay with you?

38:05.275 --> 38:07.575
Yeah, as long as it
makes me look powerful.

38:07.609 --> 38:08.442
Powerful?

38:09.342 --> 38:10.542
You're a god in this.

38:12.609 --> 38:14.442
Okay, I'll do the illustrations.

38:16.742 --> 38:18.542
Its called Zebra Girl.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.676
Once it's published,
girls all over the world

38:23.709 --> 38:25.909
will know that they can
have zebra powers, too.

38:31.909 --> 38:33.342
How does the story end?

38:44.609 --> 38:48.575
Anita says that, in
the end, Zebra Girl

38:48.609 --> 38:50.175
mauls her human father.

38:51.709 --> 38:55.342
She bites off his head
and slowly digests it

38:56.409 --> 38:58.842
inside of her acidic,
zebra stomach,

39:00.909 --> 39:02.909
and then she shits
him out of her soul.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.442
Happy ending.

39:14.642 --> 39:15.876
Did you ever finish it?

39:18.642 --> 39:20.208
Well, our original
ideas would have

39:20.242 --> 39:21.609
manifested itself in life.

39:26.575 --> 39:29.509
Dan said it deserved
a truly happy ending.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.375
Adorable.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.876
I can't believe you
told him about it.

39:39.909 --> 39:40.742
Yeah.

39:42.509 --> 39:46.475
Prince Charming comes along
and accepts Zebra Girl

39:46.509 --> 39:49.308
for her wickedly
beautiful stripes.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.509
Catherine.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.442
Catherine.

40:13.575 --> 40:16.575
I need to ask you a few more
questions about tonight.

40:16.609 --> 40:19.342
You just take your time and
answer when you're ready.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.375
How does that sound?

40:21.942 --> 40:22.776
Okay, good.

40:23.942 --> 40:26.676
Now, to the best of
your recollection,

40:26.709 --> 40:28.809
walk me through the
sequence of events,

40:28.842 --> 40:31.275
beginning with your father
entering your bedroom.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.442
Anita and I were
playing in our room.

40:40.676 --> 40:44.842
No, we were studying
in our room.

40:46.009 --> 40:47.575
19th century literature.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.642
You were studying
in your room and?

41:03.342 --> 41:04.876
It's all a bit of a blur.

41:14.542 --> 41:15.842
After we went to sleep,

41:17.242 --> 41:19.375
I found myself
reading with Daddy.

41:21.375 --> 41:22.442
I thought I was dreaming.

41:23.876 --> 41:27.542
He likes it when I hold
one side of the book

41:27.575 --> 41:29.542
and he holds the other.

41:29.575 --> 41:33.308
Two people that love each
other, holding paper.

41:37.742 --> 41:41.575
Anita saw this and she exploded

41:41.609 --> 41:43.909
into a fit of jealous rage.

41:47.409 --> 41:48.208
Catherine.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.342
There you are.

41:53.575 --> 41:54.509
What I'm about to ask you next

41:54.542 --> 41:55.609
may make you uncomfortable.

41:57.275 --> 41:59.475
Don't you think if Daddy
were trying to hurt me

42:00.976 --> 42:03.409
that I would've been able
to sort it out for myself?

42:03.442 --> 42:06.542
Do you think I'm some
internally vulnerable victim?

42:06.575 --> 42:08.375
Well, I'm not that.

42:08.409 --> 42:11.409
Trust me, I'm not the victim.

42:12.275 --> 42:15.475
I told you, I'm Zebra Girl.

42:15.509 --> 42:17.409
Catherine, I only asked
to better understand

42:17.442 --> 42:18.509
Anita's intentions.

42:18.542 --> 42:19.742
Detective-

42:19.776 --> 42:20.976
Catherine, there's
an examination-

42:21.009 --> 42:22.542
What do you mean by
rape examination?

42:22.575 --> 42:24.342
I didn't
use those exact words.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.175
I won't take it.

42:25.208 --> 42:26.375
It would only help-

42:26.409 --> 42:27.375
He didn't do anything.

42:28.642 --> 42:30.442
I wish he were still alive.

42:32.275 --> 42:37.275
If I were going to kill anyone,
it would have been Mother.

42:37.809 --> 42:38.509
Why?

42:39.642 --> 42:42.409
Because she's a
lonely, depressive,

42:42.442 --> 42:44.342
pill-popping, blame-gamer,

42:48.409 --> 42:49.642
and she hates me.

42:49.676 --> 42:50.809
Why?

42:56.842 --> 42:59.208
Because he likes
me more than her.

44:15.709 --> 44:19.275
When I was 15, I
killed my father.

44:30.009 --> 44:31.409
You're that Catherine.

44:32.976 --> 44:33.809
Yes.

44:34.942 --> 44:36.942
Catherine Blick.

44:42.609 --> 44:44.609
Are we ready to order?

44:44.642 --> 44:45.942
No, we're not.

44:45.976 --> 44:47.809
We'll signal you when
we're ready to order.

45:17.575 --> 45:20.575
I mean, you were
a national story.

45:23.509 --> 45:24.342
Sorry.

45:26.009 --> 45:29.575
Yeah, they never
showed your picture.

45:31.575 --> 45:35.242
The court said that because
I had the knife waiting,

45:35.275 --> 45:39.275
that it was premeditated.

45:44.842 --> 45:46.509
My mother never believed me.

46:13.475 --> 46:14.575
Hi, sweetheart.

46:28.475 --> 46:29.942
It was a very
abusive relationship

46:29.976 --> 46:35.175
between Daddy and Mother,
and between her and me.

46:39.642 --> 46:44.575
Most importantly, it was
abuse between him and me.

46:48.709 --> 46:49.776
I hate you.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.575
I hate you!

47:22.942 --> 47:23.942
Catherine.

47:26.308 --> 47:27.242
Look at me.

47:31.342 --> 47:32.342
It's okay.

47:33.509 --> 47:34.542
It's all right.

47:35.575 --> 47:36.942
Okay, that's it.

47:41.009 --> 47:43.909
No, I'm sorry.

47:44.876 --> 47:46.542
Listen, Detective,

47:47.742 --> 47:50.275
I suspect Anita will
go away for a while,

47:52.776 --> 47:55.342
for years in a juvenile
correctional facility.

47:57.442 --> 47:58.275
Good.

47:59.742 --> 48:01.175
She could use it.

48:03.575 --> 48:04.842
By then, she'll be 18,

48:07.676 --> 48:11.275
and she'll be able to
start over her life again.

48:11.308 --> 48:11.942
Right?

48:37.942 --> 48:39.308
What?

48:39.342 --> 48:41.609
Sorry, adult prison.

48:45.242 --> 48:46.342
Prison, no.

48:47.609 --> 48:49.208
I wasn't in there.

48:52.642 --> 48:54.509
I was so lonely
when Anita was gone,

48:55.609 --> 48:56.709
and all the neurons
were functioning

48:56.742 --> 48:58.442
the way the doctors desired.

49:05.509 --> 49:06.642
I had to go off my medication

49:06.676 --> 49:08.308
just to feel like myself again.

49:11.409 --> 49:13.542
Get off, get off!

49:13.575 --> 49:14.876
Get off me!

49:14.909 --> 49:16.242
Get off me, don't!

49:18.876 --> 49:22.475
This is what happens when
you fake swallow, Catherine.

49:28.709 --> 49:30.509
The cycle went on for years.

49:33.275 --> 49:36.742
That's why I was trapped
there til I was 26.

49:38.676 --> 49:39.709
I had to care no more.

49:44.409 --> 49:48.475
Thought I'd die a virgin.

49:57.675 --> 50:01.442
Catherine, thank you.

50:04.575 --> 50:05.475
For what?

50:05.509 --> 50:07.909
For your unadulterated honesty.

50:07.942 --> 50:09.876
You're an inspiration.

50:12.842 --> 50:15.709
To who, Jack the Ripper?

50:19.275 --> 50:20.375
You can leave now.

50:21.709 --> 50:22.776
I'll understand.

50:22.809 --> 50:23.642
Leave?

50:25.342 --> 50:26.308
I'm not leaving.

50:27.676 --> 50:28.642
This feels like the beginning

50:28.676 --> 50:30.542
of a never-a-dull-moment
romance.

50:32.842 --> 50:36.676
Plus, I'm a square and

50:39.876 --> 50:41.776
you're absolutely stunning.

50:44.308 --> 50:48.742
I am, I am better, for
quite some time now.

50:49.709 --> 50:51.175
The medicine really does help.

50:52.809 --> 50:54.709
To leaving the past
where it belongs.

51:04.876 --> 51:06.742
Since you're still sitting here,

51:06.776 --> 51:08.509
I suppose it's your turn.

51:10.809 --> 51:12.609
My turn for what?

51:12.642 --> 51:14.709
Your turn to tell me
any dirty little secrets

51:14.742 --> 51:17.876
I'd eventually discover two
years into our marriage.

51:17.909 --> 51:18.742
Um.

51:27.742 --> 51:30.642
Do you know what he told me
his dirty little secret was?

51:32.642 --> 51:34.409
That he liked
reality television.

51:37.342 --> 51:38.375
And you believed him?

51:41.809 --> 51:44.642
Wow, that was stupid.

51:49.409 --> 51:52.242
Brave, but stupid.

51:55.442 --> 51:57.375
Stupid is as stupid does.

52:12.442 --> 52:14.742
Look at this one,
it's a real beaut.

52:15.876 --> 52:18.876
That is a Gertrude Jekyll rose.

52:22.909 --> 52:24.742
I hide myself within my flower,

52:26.642 --> 52:27.676
that, wearing on your breast,

52:27.709 --> 52:31.542
you, unsuspecting, wear me, too,

52:32.542 --> 52:34.143
and the angels know the rest.

52:36.742 --> 52:37.575
Oh, okay.

52:41.342 --> 52:43.976
Okay, hold on, we're
going in the house.

52:44.009 --> 52:46.976
That's it, come on,
you're coming with me.

52:47.009 --> 52:49.842
And we're not gonna leave the
house for a very long time.

52:50.776 --> 52:52.509
Sorry, Jekyll rose.

53:51.776 --> 53:53.575
Okay, so
what if it's a boy?

53:54.842 --> 53:56.609
Then I'll
love him forever.

53:57.909 --> 53:59.842
What if it's a breadstick?

54:03.009 --> 54:04.976
Then
I'll love it forever.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.208
What a great mom.

54:21.009 --> 54:21.842
Dan.

54:23.342 --> 54:24.175
Mm hmm?

54:27.876 --> 54:28.909
You're good, right?

54:31.942 --> 54:33.776
What do you mean?

54:33.809 --> 54:35.308
Come on, you know.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.208
Catherine.

54:41.742 --> 54:43.942
I'm just being cautious.

54:43.976 --> 54:47.208
You know how much work
that I've done, you know.

54:51.009 --> 54:52.942
Wow, wow.

54:54.308 --> 54:55.776
What a way to start a family.

54:56.809 --> 54:58.942
- I just need to be sure.
- You wanna see my laptop?

55:00.742 --> 55:01.776
Do you wanna see it?

55:01.809 --> 55:02.976
You can go through it,
you can scroll through it.

55:03.009 --> 55:04.442
You can do what you want.

55:07.342 --> 55:12.342
To answer your
question, I am good.

55:14.809 --> 55:15.742
I'm good.

55:18.909 --> 55:19.942
Okay.

55:21.876 --> 55:22.709
Sorry.

55:25.275 --> 55:26.409
I just need to be sure.

55:30.909 --> 55:33.208
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
too, I'm sorry.

55:37.275 --> 55:39.409
You know I love you so much.

55:41.609 --> 55:42.942
You've just gotta trust me.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.242
I do.

55:48.809 --> 55:49.809
I really do.

55:55.009 --> 55:56.876
So, for
example, the Risperidone

55:56.909 --> 55:58.275
you've been on
for several years,

55:58.308 --> 55:59.942
is associated with a higher risk

55:59.976 --> 56:03.208
of malformations in
the first trimester.

56:03.242 --> 56:04.742
How about after?

56:04.776 --> 56:06.575
After that, the risks increase,

56:06.609 --> 56:09.609
and vary at different
stages of your pregnancy.

56:09.642 --> 56:12.942
The stats are based off
limited studies, though.

56:15.009 --> 56:18.208
There are newer forms of
low dosage antipsychotics

56:18.242 --> 56:21.275
you can try that reduce
the risk of side-effects.

56:22.909 --> 56:25.308
Dr. Anto, thank you
so much for your time.

56:25.342 --> 56:27.676
Catherine, we should
talk about options.

56:27.709 --> 56:28.542
We will.

56:29.609 --> 56:31.609
Let's go, sweetie.

56:31.642 --> 56:33.942
Dan, please, keep me
informed of your decision

56:33.976 --> 56:36.976
so that we can
monitor her properly.

56:37.009 --> 56:38.109
I will.

56:38.143 --> 56:41.275
Her mental health is just
as important as the baby.

56:42.242 --> 56:43.676
We know.

56:50.609 --> 56:51.442
Fuck.

56:54.709 --> 56:55.542
Fuck.

56:58.876 --> 56:59.676
A little you.

57:02.409 --> 57:03.509
When's it popping out?

57:05.342 --> 57:06.242
In six months.

57:10.442 --> 57:12.275
So that's really
why you called me.

57:19.475 --> 57:21.175
It could've been so perfect,

57:24.475 --> 57:26.342
if he wasn't such a,

57:30.609 --> 57:32.942
if he wasn't such a pervert.

57:35.575 --> 57:36.542
Lie down with me.

58:50.742 --> 58:51.575
Hey.

58:52.642 --> 58:54.709
How are you doing?

58:54.742 --> 58:55.575
We're alive.

58:57.642 --> 58:58.876
Is she moving yet?

59:00.275 --> 59:02.275
We're always moving.

59:06.275 --> 59:07.375
Why are you so late?

59:10.976 --> 59:14.642
Listen, Catherine, Dr.
Anto, she's really-

59:14.676 --> 59:16.375
Shut the fuck up.

59:16.409 --> 59:17.275
Oh, okay, okay.

59:18.509 --> 59:19.342
Please, don't.

59:21.342 --> 59:22.308
It's really important
that we start

59:22.342 --> 59:23.842
making our appointments, okay?

59:26.342 --> 59:27.375
How was school?

59:30.776 --> 59:34.475
Yeah, you know, it's the usual.

59:34.509 --> 59:35.842
I've got loads of
paperwork to do.

59:35.876 --> 59:37.375
Of course you do, darling.

59:39.375 --> 59:40.475
I'll be up in my office.

59:43.575 --> 59:44.409
Okay.

59:49.842 --> 59:50.776
We're good?

59:52.275 --> 59:52.909
Perfect.

59:53.809 --> 59:54.642
Okay.

01:00:06.609 --> 01:00:07.976
Pervert.

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:42.942
Oh, shh.

01:01:44.509 --> 01:01:45.575
Catherine, you're burning up.

01:01:45.609 --> 01:01:47.542
Did you take your pills?

01:01:47.575 --> 01:01:49.375
You told me not to.

01:01:49.409 --> 01:01:50.509
Did I?

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.409
Nurse!

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:54.475
Help me.

01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:55.642
Nurse!

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:58.308
- Catherine, help me.
- I'm trying.

01:01:58.342 --> 01:02:00.475
Nurse, there's a sick
little girl in here!

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:01.642
Nurse!

01:03:26.409 --> 01:03:27.642
We're sorting it, zip it.

01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:39.642
See, Mommy's here
to protect you.

01:03:42.509 --> 01:03:44.475
Mommy will always be
here to protect you.

01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:35.375
Hurry, and lets call Anita.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:05:54.475
You know what he's
doing, Catherine.

01:05:56.442 --> 01:05:57.709
You know he's in there.

01:05:58.909 --> 01:06:00.709
You know what you have to do.

01:06:07.976 --> 01:06:11.409

into another mess, haven't I?

Help me.

01:07:04.742 --> 01:07:05.942
Daddy.

01:07:05.976 --> 01:07:07.575
Hi, Catherine!

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:09.509
Catherine.

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:10.475
Hi, Catherine.

01:07:11.676 --> 01:07:13.642
- We're here.
- Catherine, help me.

01:07:13.676 --> 01:07:15.342
Catherine, help me.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:18.842
It's not what it.

01:07:30.909 --> 01:07:32.942
You are not a victim.

01:07:32.976 --> 01:07:35.642
No you're not a victim.

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:37.642
You're not a victim,
you're not a victim,

01:07:37.676 --> 01:07:39.275
you're not a victim.

01:07:39.308 --> 01:07:41.509
- Where are you going?
- I need to find Zebra Girl!

01:07:46.009 --> 01:07:47.676
- So you did finish it?
- Yes.

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.676
And with a happy fucking ending.

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.208
Where the bloody hell is it?

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:54.876
Got it.

01:07:57.509 --> 01:07:59.942
I will show you I'm
not a victim, Anita.

01:07:59.976 --> 01:08:01.442
Prince Charming
accepts Zebra Girl

01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:03.509
and they live
happily ever after.

01:08:13.742 --> 01:08:14.742
What is it?

01:08:21.509 --> 01:08:23.509
"For as she had always known,

01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:26.709
"a zebra is simply
just a painted horse.

01:08:27.742 --> 01:08:30.408
"Sometimes you buck the horse,

01:08:30.442 --> 01:08:32.375
"sometimes the horse bucks you.

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:34.475
"The end."

01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:39.642
The bloody hell
does that even mean?

01:08:42.642 --> 01:08:44.876
I'll show you what it means.

01:08:49.676 --> 01:08:52.709
It means all along, I knew
that perverted bastard

01:08:52.742 --> 01:08:53.809
was nothing...

01:08:55.876 --> 01:08:57.876
Oh my God.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:04.509
What is it?

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:10.475
Oh, shit.

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:19.908
You're so damn stupid.

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:25.841
Tonight.

01:09:26.676 --> 01:09:28.609
I'll be up in my office.

01:09:28.642 --> 01:09:29.908
You've just gotta trust me.

01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:32.776
I love you.

01:09:34.308 --> 01:09:36.308
Catherine!

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:38.776
Catherine, wait!

01:09:44.975 --> 01:09:46.942
Keep her safe.

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:49.242
I'm going to protect
my little girl.

01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:51.809
I'm not going to
let anyone hurt her.

01:09:51.841 --> 01:09:52.676
Oh my God.

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:54.242
I'll look after her
and keep her safe.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:55.242
You're not gonna
be able to do that.

01:09:56.876 --> 01:09:58.175
I'm going to love her.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.876
I just wanted a healthy baby.

01:11:42.676 --> 01:11:45.208
I'm gonna miss you.

01:11:51.409 --> 01:11:52.776
All
units are responding.

01:12:03.776 --> 01:12:04.609
I'm not alone.

01:12:13.275 --> 01:12:15.742
Just one of nature's mistakes.

01:12:15.776 --> 01:12:17.642
You ain't no mistake.

01:12:18.509 --> 01:12:19.676
You're Zebra Girl.
