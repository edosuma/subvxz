00:02.800 --> 00:05.566
( delighted laughter )

00:05.633 --> 00:08.400
OKAY, KYLE. THAT'S YOUR
I'M‐'BOUT‐TO‐GET‐PAID LAUGH.

00:08.466 --> 00:09.533
WHAT'S UP?

00:09.600 --> 00:11.766
WELL, I WILL LET YOU IN
ON THE RESULTS

00:11.833 --> 00:13.366
OF MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH

00:13.433 --> 00:15.366
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT
TO YOURSELF.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.700
WE CAN KEEP A SECRET

00:16.766 --> 00:19.600
MR. STILL‐PLAYS‐
THE‐SOUNDTRACK‐FROM‐ <i>FAME.</i>

00:21.266 --> 00:23.100
OH, MAN,
I LOVED THAT MOVIE!

00:23.166 --> 00:26.733
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT CUTE
LITTLE SONGBIRD, IRENE CARA?

00:26.800 --> 00:29.933
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT ANGRY DANCER, LEROY.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.366
( all laughing )

00:31.433 --> 00:34.133
Maxine:
YOU'RE RIGHT, GIRL!
WORK IT! I LOVED LEROY!

00:35.500 --> 00:37.900
OKAY, CAN WE
GET TO SOMETHING

00:37.966 --> 00:41.200
WITH JUST A LITTLE MORE
SUBSTANCE, PLEASE?

00:41.266 --> 00:44.333
NOW, YOU ALL HEARD
OF THE SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON

00:44.400 --> 00:46.366
KICKBOXING SWAMP RATS, RIGHT?

00:46.433 --> 00:49.900
THAT'S THE ONE
RIGHT AFTER <i>TURBO POSSUMS.</i>

00:49.966 --> 00:54.233
WELL, TOMORROW, HARTMAN FOODS
IS RELEASING A NEW CEREAL

00:54.300 --> 00:55.733
CONNECTED WITH THE SHOW.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.900
AW, MAN, EVERY KID
IN THE COUNTRY

00:57.966 --> 00:59.166
WATCHES THAT SHOW.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.373
YOU KNOW THEY'LL WANT
TO GRUB ON THAT.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.406
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE
ALREADY PURCHASED HARTMAN STOCK

01:04.473 --> 01:05.973
FOR ALL OF MY CLIENTS

01:06.040 --> 01:08.173
AND WHEN THEIR STOCK
DOUBLES ON THE MARKET

01:08.240 --> 01:10.040
SO WILL MY STANDING
ON WALL STREET.

01:10.106 --> 01:11.440
I WILL BE GOD. THANK YOU.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.806
I HEAR YOU, KYLE.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.806
YOU WANT ME TO INVEST
THE TEN GRAND I WON

01:15.873 --> 01:18.240
IN THAT
THREE‐POINT‐SHOT CONTEST.

01:18.306 --> 01:22.473
WELL, I'M VERY SORRY TO SAY
I CAN ONLY PART WITH A <i>SKOSH</i>

01:22.540 --> 01:25.006
OF THE JONES
FINANCIAL MOTHER LODE.

01:25.073 --> 01:27.106
WELL, YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR ENTIRE <i>SKOSH</i>

01:27.173 --> 01:29.273
BECAUSE DEALING
WITH A FRIEND'S MONEY

01:29.340 --> 01:32.940
IN THE STOCK MARKET, MAN, IS
THE SUREST WAY TO GAIN AN ENEMY.

01:33.006 --> 01:35.373
Maxine:
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
WAIT A MINUTE NOW!

01:35.440 --> 01:36.673
YOU KNOW, I...

01:36.740 --> 01:39.240
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE,
BUT FRIENDS WE'RE NOT.

01:39.306 --> 01:40.673
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK.

01:41.673 --> 01:42.906
YOU KNOW, UH, FRIEND

01:42.973 --> 01:45.206
IT WAS MY PLEASURE
SPENDING THE WEEKEND

01:45.273 --> 01:48.906
INSTALLING THE PROFESSIONAL‐
QUALITY TIE RACK IN YOUR CLOSET.

01:48.973 --> 01:51.540
NOW, WHY AM I BRINGING
THIS UP AT THIS TIME?

01:51.606 --> 01:53.240
WELL, YOU BE THE JUDGE.

01:53.306 --> 01:54.673
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.240
I GUESS I CAN HELP YOU
ALL OUT JUST THIS ONCE.

01:57.306 --> 01:59.473
WELL, NOW, OBIE,
I DON'T KNOW.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.380
THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE RISKY.

02:01.446 --> 02:04.546
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR MONEY SOMEPLACE SAFE

02:04.613 --> 02:07.746
LIKE A PYRAMID SCHEME
OR KENO.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.280
WELL, I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE
WHAT LITTLE MONEY I DO HAVE

02:12.346 --> 02:14.613
TO KYLE WITHOUT SOME
SERIOUS RESEARCH.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.046
HOW DO YOU KNOW KIDS ARE
EVEN GOING TO EAT IT?

02:17.113 --> 02:21.080
IT'S CALLED "SUGAR‐COATED
FROSTED SWAMP NUGGETS O' HONEY."

02:21.146 --> 02:22.680
DANG.

02:22.746 --> 02:26.180
SOUNDS LIKE ME AND ALL
THE DENTISTS OF AMERICA

02:26.246 --> 02:28.680
ARE ABOUT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY!

KEEP THAT UP, I'M GONNA NAME
A TORNADO AFTER YOU.

YOUR OFFICE IN THE BUILDING?

04:07.860 --> 04:10.393
NO, I'M HERE
FOR A LUNCH APPOINTMENT.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.160
MY ARCHITECTURAL FIRM

04:15.060 --> 04:17.459
HAVE YOU DESIGNED ANYTHING

ROOFTOP GARDEN

NEVER MIND.

OH, WELL, UM...

04:43.860 --> 04:46.993
DO YOU HAVE A BUSINESS CARD
SO THAT I COULD THINK IT OVER

04:47.060 --> 04:49.460
AND MAKE YOU
SWEAT IT OUT FOR A DAY?

04:49.526 --> 04:53.393
IF IT WILL MAKE IT ANY EASIER,
IT'S A TOLL‐FREE NUMBER.

04:55.426 --> 04:57.293
UH, HOW SHOULD I DRESS?

04:57.360 --> 05:00.566
JUST WEAR ANYTHING
TO GO WITH THAT LOVELY SMILE.

IN CENTRAL PARK.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.666
DIG THIS: I GET

HE PREDICTS THE WEATHER
ONCE A YEAR.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.140
JUST A MINUTE, JUST A MINUTE.
JUST, JUST A MINUTE.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.973
NOW IS THE TIME FOR A SENSIBLE
COURSE OF INVESTMENTS

06:56.040 --> 06:57.806
SO I'M GOING TO PUT TOGETHER

06:57.873 --> 07:00.846
A FEW JUNIOR INVESTMENT
PORTFOLIOS FOR EACH OF YOU.

07:00.913 --> 07:02.580
OKAY, BUT, UH, LOOK HERE.

07:02.646 --> 07:04.513
A WORD OF CAUTION‐‐

07:04.580 --> 07:06.880
I AM A BITCH WHEN I'M BROKE.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.080
OKAY, GO AHEAD ON, BRO.

07:08.146 --> 07:10.413
DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.346
HEY, KYLE, LET'S POOL
OUR INVESTMENT IDEAS.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.513
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GOING TO BUY?

07:14.580 --> 07:16.180
EAR PLUGS.

07:17.213 --> 07:18.746
NO, I MEAN IT, WARNER.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.680
THOSE WERE THE BEST SEATS
I HAVE EVER HAD AT THE OPERA.

07:21.746 --> 07:24.213
I MEAN, I COULD
ACTUALLY SEE THE SWEAT

07:24.280 --> 07:26.380
DRIP OFF PAVAROTTI'S
SECOND CHIN.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.713
MM, WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.680
THERE'S ANOTHER CALL.

07:30.746 --> 07:32.446
HELLO?

07:32.513 --> 07:34.680
OH, HI, COLE... UH‐HUH.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.713
WELL, OF COURSE WE'RE STILL ON
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.080
OKAY. SMOOCHES!

07:40.146 --> 07:42.546
HELLO, WARNER?

07:42.613 --> 07:44.480
UH‐HUH... OKAY.

07:44.546 --> 07:48.380
OF COURSE WE'RE STILL ON
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

07:48.446 --> 07:50.013
HMM‐MM. SMOOCHES!

07:51.180 --> 07:53.113
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

07:53.180 --> 07:55.713
THE LADY'S GOING
TO JUGGLE A TOMAHAWK

07:55.780 --> 07:57.313
A FLAMING TORCH

07:57.380 --> 07:59.346
AND A LIVE TUNA!

08:00.920 --> 08:03.286
( snickering )

08:03.353 --> 08:05.920
NOW, REGINE, THESE TWO GUYS
YOU'RE DATING‐‐

08:05.986 --> 08:08.453
DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.920
( giggles ):
THAT'S CUTE, SYNCLAIRE...
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:10.986 --> 08:13.753
ACTUALLY, IT IS STARTING
TO GET A LITTLE TRICKY

08:13.820 --> 08:15.820
BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THEM BOTH.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.920
OH, BUT DON'T
GET ME WRONG, THOUGH.

08:17.986 --> 08:19.486
THERE IS NO E. O. M. YET.

08:19.553 --> 08:20.753
E.O.M.?

08:20.820 --> 08:23.720
"EXPECTATIONS
OF MONOGAMY."

08:23.786 --> 08:26.120
IT'S THAT CRITICAL PHASE
OF A RELATIONSHIP

08:26.186 --> 08:27.986
WHERE YOU JUST PASS
CASUAL DATING

08:28.053 --> 08:31.120
BUT HAVEN'T YET CALLED
ALL THE WOMEN IN HIS PHONE BOOK

08:31.186 --> 08:33.285
AND TOLD THEM TO <i>BACK OFF.</i>

08:33.352 --> 08:35.653
RIGHT. I MEAN,
WHEN YOU'RE FIRST DATING

08:35.720 --> 08:37.852
YOU KNOW YOU WANT
TO LOOK YOUR BEST.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.653
YOU SHAVE YOUR LEG,
MAYBE BOTH...

08:44.886 --> 08:47.220
BUT WHEN YOU HIT E. O. M.

08:47.286 --> 08:52.353
HE THINKS YOUR FURRY LEGS
ARE SEXY, YOU KNOW?

08:52.420 --> 08:54.453
THE POINT IS
THAT BOTH OF THESE GENTLEMEN

08:54.520 --> 08:56.253
OFFER THEIR OWN
PARTICULAR CHARMS.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.220
I MEAN, WARNER‐‐
HE'S DISTINGUISHED

08:58.286 --> 09:01.560
AND HE'S KIND
AND HE'S FINANCIALLY WELL‐FIXED.

09:01.626 --> 09:05.426
NOW, COLE‐‐ HE'S HANDSOME
AND HE'S FUNNY AND FAMOUS

09:05.493 --> 09:08.093
AND FINANCIALLY WELL‐FIXED.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.860
TOGETHER, I AM DATING
THE PERFECT MAN.

09:14.326 --> 09:16.793
DIDN'T KYLE INVEST
SOME OF YOUR MONEY

09:16.860 --> 09:19.126
IN KANSAS CONTINENTAL
COMMUNICATIONS?

09:19.193 --> 09:22.026
YEAH, WE ALL GOT A BLOCK
OF CAN‐CON‐COM.

09:22.093 --> 09:24.960
WELL, IT'S DOWN
TWO POINTS.

09:25.026 --> 09:28.126
YOU KNOW, THIS STOCK MARKET
STUFF WAS A LOT MORE FUN

09:28.193 --> 09:30.960
WHEN WE AIN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON.

09:31.026 --> 09:32.326
I KNOW ONE THING‐‐

09:32.393 --> 09:36.026
I GOT FIVE SHARES OF KYLE'S ASS
IF HE LOST MY MONEY.

09:36.093 --> 09:37.493
( pounding )

09:39.526 --> 09:41.960
I HAVE HAD IT WITH YOU PEOPLE.

09:42.026 --> 09:44.226
I GOT MORE CALLS
FROM YOU ALL TODAY

09:44.293 --> 09:47.226
THAN I GOT FROM ALL
OF MY INVESTORS LAST MONTH

09:47.293 --> 09:49.760
AND WITH SUCH SAVVY
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

09:49.826 --> 09:53.260
AS "KYLE, BUY TEN SHARES
OF DENZEL WASHINGTON."

09:53.326 --> 09:54.893
WELL, DENZEL CUTE.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.893
AND YOU!
YOU WANTED ME TO INVEST

09:56.960 --> 09:58.826
IN A RECLINING ELECTRIC CHAIR?

09:58.893 --> 09:59.833
WHO?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.033
AND WHERE'S...

10:01.100 --> 10:04.133
( grunting )

10:04.200 --> 10:06.666
AND YOU WANTED ME
TO BUY STOCK IN McDONALD'S

10:06.733 --> 10:09.000
JUST SO YOU COULD WALTZ IN

10:09.066 --> 10:11.833
AND ASK FOR THE RECIPE
FOR THE SECRET SAUCE?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.100
AND YOU..!

10:13.166 --> 10:14.433
( sputtering )

10:14.500 --> 10:17.166
WELL, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHY YOU CALLED.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.733
I HIT
THE WRONG SPEED‐DIAL BUTTON.

10:22.433 --> 10:23.933
ALL RIGHT, B. S. HUTTON

10:24.000 --> 10:26.300
I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH HAVE I LOST

10:26.366 --> 10:27.800
SINCE THIS MORNING.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.333
( clicking )

10:34.466 --> 10:35.900
ROUGHLY THREE DOLLARS.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.600
<i>ROUGHLY?</i>

10:37.666 --> 10:40.133
WHAT KIND
OF SLIPSHOD OPERATION

10:40.200 --> 10:42.666
ARE YOU RUNNING?!

10:42.733 --> 10:46.400
THE KIND THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE
THE THREE OF YOU

10:46.466 --> 10:49.000
BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW‐‐
HA‐HA!

10:49.066 --> 10:51.533
I AM NO LONGER
YOUR STOCKBROKER.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.533
WELL, THAT'S JUST FINE

10:53.600 --> 10:55.233
BUT YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT ME MOUNTING

10:55.300 --> 10:58.000
THAT WATERPROOF KARAOKE MACHINE
IN YOUR SHOWER!

10:58.066 --> 10:59.600
EH, FORGET HIM.

10:59.666 --> 11:02.740
HE WASN'T
VERY PROFESSIONAL ANYWAY.

11:02.806 --> 11:05.440
YOU KNOW, AFTER A FEW
OF MY TEST CALLS

11:05.506 --> 11:08.340
JUST TO SEE IF HE WAS
RIGHT BY THE PHONE

11:08.406 --> 11:09.573
WHEN I NEEDED HIM

11:09.640 --> 11:12.173
HE CAUGHT QUITE
THE LITTLE ATTITUDE.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.206
HEY, YOU GUYS.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.473
YOU REMEMBER WARNER.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.673
NICE TO SEE
YOU AGAIN.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.573
SAY, DO YOU THINK
IT'D BE ALL RIGHT

11:18.640 --> 11:21.173
IF WE TURNED TO CHANNEL 5
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.273
WHAT'S ON?

11:22.340 --> 11:25.140
Front:
This is Cole Front saying:

11:25.206 --> 11:26.773
whenever there are
clouds above

11:26.840 --> 11:29.140
just think of Cole
and the forecast is love.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.306
By the way,
Happy 89th Birthday, Grandma.

11:32.373 --> 11:34.406
HE MENTIONS MY MOTHER

11:34.473 --> 11:35.706
EVERY YEAR.

11:35.773 --> 11:37.773
WHAT A GOOD SON.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.706
SON?

11:47.806 --> 11:50.740
I GUESS THAT
MAKES YOU MAMA.

11:53.273 --> 11:56.306
( Maxine cackling )

12:00.913 --> 12:02.146
SO, COLE FRONT

12:02.213 --> 12:04.846
THE WEATHER GUY,
IS YOUR SON?

12:04.913 --> 12:06.713
THAT'S MY BOY.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.713
BUT YOU HAVE
DIFFERENT LAST NAMES.

12:08.780 --> 12:10.380
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

12:10.446 --> 12:12.246
IT MAKES NO SENSE, I TELL YOU!

12:12.313 --> 12:15.280
WELL, "DEVANT" IS
FRENCH FOR "FRONT"

12:15.346 --> 12:17.980
AND COLE WANTED
SOMETHING CATCHY

12:18.046 --> 12:19.280
FOR TELEVISION.

12:19.346 --> 12:23.846
GOOD THING OUR FAMILY
NAME WASN'T DERRIERE.

12:23.913 --> 12:27.380
YOU KNOW, I HAD A SECOND GRADE
TEACHER NAMED MR. BUTTS

12:27.446 --> 12:28.780
AND WE LIKED HIM.

12:33.513 --> 12:34.913
SO, WARNER...

12:34.980 --> 12:37.113
I MEAN, IS YOUR
GOOD‐LOOKING SON

12:37.180 --> 12:38.846
SEEING ANYBODY
RIGHT NOW?

12:38.913 --> 12:40.046
COLE?

12:40.113 --> 12:41.846
I DON'T KEEP TRACK.

12:41.913 --> 12:43.246
CLEARLY.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.980
OKAY, UH, WARNER, UH, YOU KNOW

12:47.046 --> 12:49.413
TONIGHT HAS REALLY BEEN GREAT

12:49.480 --> 12:52.813
BUT, UH, OOH,
I REALLY NEED TO LAY DOWN.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.146
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:54.213 --> 12:56.780
FEELING A LITTLE
UNDER THE WEATHER?

13:02.453 --> 13:04.386
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?

13:04.453 --> 13:05.386
YES.

13:05.453 --> 13:06.853
FEEL BETTER.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.453
OKAY.

13:09.453 --> 13:13.053
TEN MILLION FREAKING PEOPLE
IN NEW YORK CITY

13:13.120 --> 13:16.386
AND I HAVE TO PICK
A FATHER AND A SON?!

13:16.453 --> 13:18.753
B‐B‐BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS, HUH?

13:18.820 --> 13:21.520
WH‐WH‐WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED?

13:21.586 --> 13:23.653
TH‐TH‐THIS IS SO...

13:23.720 --> 13:26.386
IT'S... IT‐IT'S SO...

13:26.453 --> 13:28.453
NINETIES.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.453
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.120
I KNOW THAT LITTLE
ELF FACE OF YOURS

13:37.186 --> 13:39.353
DOES NOT MEAN
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.520
KHADIJAH, NOW, COME ON.

13:41.586 --> 13:45.386
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE RELATED,
WHY SHOULD I PENALIZE THEM?

13:47.053 --> 13:48.653
I DON'T KNOW, REGINE.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.320
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN
SOME PRETTY <i>FREAKY</i>

13:51.386 --> 13:52.453
DATING SITUATIONS.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.986
I MEAN, BROTHER‐BROTHER

13:55.053 --> 13:57.320
GRANDUNCLE‐NEPHEW...

13:57.386 --> 13:58.853
KYLE.

14:01.593 --> 14:03.526
BUT FATHER‐SON.

14:04.993 --> 14:06.660
THAT'S JUST SICK.

14:08.460 --> 14:11.393
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT THESE TWO ANYWAY?

14:11.460 --> 14:15.093
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
RICHARD AND LeVAR BURTON.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.193
YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS?

14:24.260 --> 14:26.693
OH. WELL, I CAN
CERTAINLY SEE WHY.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.460
THEY HAVE SHRIMP SCAMPI PREPARED
JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

14:29.526 --> 14:31.560
YOU MEAN
WITH A DOCTOR TO REVIVE ME?

14:31.626 --> 14:33.660
YOU KNOW
I'M ALLERGIC TO SHELL FISH.

14:33.726 --> 14:34.693
MY FATHER

14:34.760 --> 14:36.160
LIKES IT, THOUGH.

14:36.226 --> 14:37.393
REALLY?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.593
YEAH.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.726
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

14:40.793 --> 14:42.793
THE SCAMPI
IS LIGHT ON THE GARLIC.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.826
JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.

14:44.893 --> 14:46.293
( Regine laughs )

14:46.360 --> 14:49.760
WELL, I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS
MORE THAN YOU DID THAT MOVIE.

14:49.826 --> 14:51.060
I'M SORRY, REGINE.

14:51.126 --> 14:54.260
I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN
A BIG MARIO VAN PEEBLES FAN.

14:56.726 --> 14:57.926
Regine:
YOU KNOW

14:57.993 --> 15:00.266
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR THIS NECKLACE.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.333
IT'S SO SPECIAL.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.933
YES, IT IS, ISN'T IT?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.133
WHICH REMINDS ME.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.200
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO
FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

15:07.266 --> 15:11.666
WE SHOULD KICK BACK
AND WATCH <i>NEW JACK CITY...</i>

15:11.733 --> 15:13.933
AND <i>THE MAKING OF NEW JACK CITY</i>

15:14.000 --> 15:18.266
AND JUST GET US A BIG PLATTER
OF MANWICHES, YOU KNOW THAT?

15:18.333 --> 15:22.800
WELL, I ALREADY HAVE APRIL 14
CIRCLED ON MY CALENDAR.

15:22.866 --> 15:24.233
APRIL 14?

15:24.300 --> 15:25.866
YOU KNOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.500
THAT'S MY FATHER'S BIRTHDAY.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.200
WELL, GOOD FOR HIM.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.866
MY, THAT'S A LOVELY NECKLACE.

15:34.933 --> 15:38.733
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE ONE
MY SON GAVE HIS EX‐WIFE.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.133
ANYWAY, WEDNESDAY'S HIS BIRTHDAY

15:43.200 --> 15:45.933
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
A LITTLE FAMILY GATHERING.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.533
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU OFF
TO MY TWO SONS.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.333
YOU HAVE ANOTHER SON?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.600
YES. HE'S A PRIEST.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.200
THANK GOD.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.806
( knock at door )

16:00.873 --> 16:01.840
HEY, HEY.

16:01.906 --> 16:05.106
WELL, IF IT ISN'T OUR EX‐BROKER.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.606
KYLE, WE FOUND A BROKER
AT YOUR INVESTMENT FIRM

16:07.673 --> 16:10.540
THAT WAS VERY HAPPY
TO LOOK AFTER OUR INVESTMENTS.

16:10.606 --> 16:11.740
YES, I KNOW.

16:11.806 --> 16:14.106
THIS AFTERNOON
HE KISSED ME ON THE FOREHEAD

16:14.173 --> 16:15.873
SAID,
"THANK YOU FOR THE SUCKERS"

16:15.940 --> 16:18.940
AS HE HEADED OUT THE DOOR
TOWARD THE PORSCHE DEALERSHIP.

16:19.006 --> 16:20.340
DO YOU RECALL

16:20.406 --> 16:23.873
ME TELLING YOU THAT EVERY TIME
YOU BUY AND SELL STOCK

16:23.940 --> 16:26.173
THERE IS A TWO PERCENT
COMMISSION?

16:26.240 --> 16:28.073
KIND OF.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.106
YEAH, WELL, YOU PEOPLE

16:30.173 --> 16:33.540
KIND OF MADE 317
TRANSACTIONS TODAY.

16:33.606 --> 16:35.040
( devious chuckle )

16:35.106 --> 16:39.073
FOR SOME REASON,
MY STOMACH HURTS.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.006
SO WHAT YOU SAYING?

16:42.073 --> 16:44.540
ALL MY MAN'S MONEY'S GONE?

16:46.206 --> 16:47.473
( Kyle snickers )

16:47.540 --> 16:48.706
NO.

16:48.773 --> 16:50.473
FORTUNATELY,
I WAS ABLE TO POOL

16:50.540 --> 16:52.573
THE REMAINING ASSETS
AND INVEST THEM

16:52.640 --> 16:55.140
IN A DIFFERENT KIND
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

16:55.206 --> 16:56.340
HERE, HOLD THIS.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.606
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.

16:58.673 --> 17:01.613
YOU TAKE THE COIN
AND PLACE IT ON THE TOMB.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.413
THEN THE LITTLE MAN'S
HAND COMES OUT

17:04.480 --> 17:07.346
AND SNATCHES IT AWAY.

17:09.980 --> 17:12.346
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.945
ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

17:15.346 --> 17:16.613
Kyle:
AH. SO, REGINE

17:16.680 --> 17:18.880
I SEE YOU'RE BACK
FROM YOUR DATE

17:18.945 --> 17:20.280
WITH SANFORD AND SON.

17:20.346 --> 17:22.346
( chuckles loudly )

17:26.945 --> 17:29.246
Y'ALL, IT'S GETTING TO BE
A LITTLE MUCH.

17:29.313 --> 17:32.113
I MEAN, I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
BE ON MY GUARD

17:32.180 --> 17:35.813
SO THAT I DON'T CONFUSE
WHO DID WHAT AND WHEN AND WHERE.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.746
OOH, IF I WANTED TO WORK
THIS HARD AT DATING

17:38.813 --> 17:40.813
I'D HAVE BEEN ONE OF Y'ALL.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.480
( knocking )

17:47.680 --> 17:49.613
OH, REGINE.

17:51.546 --> 17:53.746
COMPANY.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.886
WARNER. COLE.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.420
WON'T YOU COME IN.

18:01.486 --> 18:03.353
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE?

18:03.420 --> 18:04.586
OH, WE'RE OUT.

18:04.653 --> 18:05.986
I'LL RUN TO JERSEY

18:06.053 --> 18:07.220
AND GET SOME.

18:08.886 --> 18:10.753
REGINE, WE'D
LIKE TO SPEAK

18:10.820 --> 18:12.953
WITH BOTH YOUR
FACES, PLEASE.

18:15.653 --> 18:17.486
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

18:24.153 --> 18:25.820
GO AHEAD,
RIGHT THERE.

18:30.153 --> 18:31.753
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:31.820 --> 18:34.420
I THINK THAT REGINE
WANTS TO BE ALONE

18:34.486 --> 18:36.286
WITH HER DATE
AND HIS SON.

18:36.353 --> 18:38.753
OR... HER DATE
AND HIS DAD.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.686
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.720
I MEAN THEM.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.720
GOOD SAVE, SYNCLAIRE.

18:43.786 --> 18:45.520
ACTUALLY, SHE
DID ALL RIGHT.

18:45.586 --> 18:47.653
I MEAN, THIS IS
A AWKWARD SITUATION.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.753
YOU'RE RIGHT

18:48.820 --> 18:50.520
THIS IS THE MOST
AWKWARD SITUATION...

18:50.586 --> 18:52.153
GET OUT!

18:52.220 --> 18:54.120
OKAY.
OKAY.

18:54.186 --> 18:56.353
( murmuring )

18:56.420 --> 18:59.826
( <i>Kyle humming theme to</i>
Sanford and Son )

19:04.026 --> 19:07.693
REGINE, WE HAVE
A PROBLEM
ON YOUR HANDS.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.026
I WAS HOPING TO COME HERE
AND FIND OUT IT WASN'T TRUE.

19:11.093 --> 19:14.426
SEE IF I LEFT MY SUNGLASSES
HERE THE OTHER DAY.

19:15.526 --> 19:18.560
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

19:18.626 --> 19:20.760
AND I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET SWEET ON YOU

19:20.826 --> 19:23.293
AND THEN DISCOVER YOU
WERE DATING MY SON.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.360
I THOUGHT WE HAD
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

19:25.426 --> 19:26.826
I TOLD YOU SECRETS

19:26.893 --> 19:29.193
ONLY A TRAINED
METEOROLOGIST WOULD KNOW

19:29.260 --> 19:30.993
LIKE, LIKE WHAT IS SLEET.

19:31.060 --> 19:35.293
BELIEVE ME, I AM
VERY FOND OF BOTH OF YOU.

19:35.360 --> 19:39.026
ALL I CAN SAY IS
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

19:39.093 --> 19:43.393
I‐I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER
ON‐ON BOTH OF YOU

19:43.460 --> 19:46.126
IF YOU'D JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

19:47.593 --> 19:48.860
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.060
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET OFF THAT EASY.

19:51.126 --> 19:52.660
YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE OF US.

19:52.726 --> 19:54.560
COLE, DON'T PUT
HER ON THE SPOT.

19:54.626 --> 19:55.693
IT'S NOT FAIR.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.360
SHE SAYS SHE LIKES US BOTH.

19:57.426 --> 19:58.460
SHE SHOULD PICK.

19:58.526 --> 20:02.166
FINE. I WILL PICK.

20:02.233 --> 20:03.366
GOOD.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.400
I CHOOSE YOU...

20:09.466 --> 20:11.200
WARNER.

20:21.033 --> 20:23.100
SO, IT'S LIKE THAT, HUH?

20:23.166 --> 20:24.433
HEY, FRANKLY

20:24.500 --> 20:26.666
I THINK SHE MADE A GOOD CHOICE.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.233
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.933
I... I DON'T NEED YOU,
I DON'T NEED ANYONE.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.433
I'M A WEATHERMAN.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.100
COLE FRONT IS
BACK ON THE HUNT.

20:50.766 --> 20:53.866
WARNER, I DID MEAN
WHAT I SAID.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.666
I REALLY ENJOY
YOUR COMPANY

20:56.733 --> 20:57.933
BUT I WOULD UNDERSTAND

20:58.000 --> 21:00.040
IF YOU NEVER WANTED
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

21:00.106 --> 21:03.573
WELL, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU LEADING US ON.

21:05.706 --> 21:08.240
AND I HAVE TO CONSIDER
MY SON'S FEELINGS.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.506
WHAT THE HELL.

21:11.573 --> 21:14.006
I'LL BE DEAD
LONG BEFORE HE IS.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.306
LET'S GO DANCING.

21:15.373 --> 21:16.573
WELL, GREAT.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.773
UM, OH, I KNOW
THIS GREAT PLACE

21:18.840 --> 21:21.806
THAT PLAYS OLDIES,
AND WE CAN DO THE TWIST.

21:21.873 --> 21:23.773
BUMP THAT. I'M INTO HIP HOP.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.240
YOU DOWN WITH
THE BUTTERFLY?

21:26.306 --> 21:28.306
( shrieking laughter )

21:30.540 --> 21:32.640
<i>WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

21:37.658 --> 21:38.712
FOR THOSE OF YOU

21:38.779 --> 21:40.579
CAUGHT IN YESTERDAY'S
FLASH FLOOD

21:40.645 --> 21:42.045
YOU'RE PROBABLY BLAMING ME

21:42.112 --> 21:44.879
FOR SLAPPING MR. SUNSHINE
UP ON THE WEATHER BOARD.

21:44.945 --> 21:46.879
I WAS HAVING
SOME PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

21:46.945 --> 21:48.212
KNIFE IN MY BACK.

21:48.279 --> 21:51.012
WE'VE GOT SOME HEAVY CLOUDS
IN THE TRI‐STATE AREA

21:51.079 --> 21:53.345
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO TELL YOU THAT.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.545
OPEN THE DAMN WINDOW
AND TAKE A LOOK OUT.

21:55.612 --> 21:57.279
THOSE ON THE COAST

21:57.345 --> 21:59.679
WILL NOTICE
A LOT OF LOW‐LYING FOG.

21:59.745 --> 22:02.952
JUST SOME LOW, LYING,
DUPLICITOUS, DECEITFUL FOG.

22:03.019 --> 22:06.219
I WANT TO SEND
A LITTLE SHOUT‐OUT TO MY POP.

22:06.285 --> 22:07.519
HOW YOU DOING, POP?

22:07.585 --> 22:08.652
HI, REGINE.

22:08.719 --> 22:11.352
I'LL TAKE A LITTLE PAUSE
FOR THE CAUSE.

22:11.419 --> 22:13.519
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LOVE.

22:13.585 --> 22:14.819
AND WE'RE CLEAR.

22:14.885 --> 22:17.685
BOSS WANTS TO SEE YOU
RIGHT AWAY, COLE.

22:17.752 --> 22:18.819
PERFECT, MAN.

22:18.885 --> 22:20.385
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

22:20.452 --> 22:23.052
