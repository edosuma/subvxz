It closes borders and

41:31.245 --> 41:33.246
Here.

41:34.569 --> 41:36.134
That's the hotel where I met Avery.

41:36.159 --> 41:39.186
Yeah, this is you and Avery
on the day you met.

41:40.054 --> 41:44.190
And this... is on the day before.

41:44.364 --> 41:45.883
She's meeting with someone.

41:45.908 --> 41:46.981
And if I had to guess,

41:47.006 --> 41:49.141
there is a stack of cash
in that envelope.

41:49.443 --> 41:50.643
Can you get a different angle?

41:50.668 --> 41:52.218
I was about to do that
when you walked in.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.629
Let me see if I can
pull up the time code

41:53.654 --> 41:55.793
and get into another camera.

41:57.304 --> 41:59.305
Oh, my God, is that...

42:01.976 --> 42:03.295
It's Roman.

42:03.524 --> 42:04.722
Wait, does that mean...

42:04.766 --> 42:06.767
It means that he set me up.
