00:02.350 --> 00:04.004
[female narrator]
"Gossip girl" here,
your one and only source

00:04.091 --> 00:05.701
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.095
- Take me now.
- Why?

00:08.182 --> 00:11.924
- To prove that nothing matters.
- That's not the Blair I want.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.578
[Chuck]
What are you doing
with this insect?

00:13.665 --> 00:15.754
Having the time of my life,
thank you.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.843
[Hazel]
'Serena is in
"Women's Wear Daily."'

00:17.930 --> 00:19.497
[Penelope]
'With Poppy Lifton.'

00:19.584 --> 00:21.630
Remember when we were
Savannah and Svetlana.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.241
I totally forgot about
Savannah and Svetlana.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.503
Svetlana.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.983
Andrew got caught
in a riptide.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.158
Yeah, if we had known, we..

00:28.245 --> 00:29.681
...wouldn't have
even bothered you.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.422
- Is it over?
- We've already lost one son.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.120
We weren't losing another.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.165
So you excited for Nate's
big adventure this summer?

00:35.252 --> 00:36.819
He told you about
our backpacking trip?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.125
[Nate]
'I was talking about
the internship'

00:38.212 --> 00:39.517
'at the mayor's office.'

00:39.604 --> 00:42.390
- I should go.
- Wait. Stay.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.398
And who am I?

00:50.485 --> 00:52.748
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.490
You know you love me.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.101
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.454
Mornings are simply more fun
on the upper east side.

01:03.541 --> 01:06.588
Our favorite things to wake up
to, the sun in the sky

01:06.675 --> 01:09.199
the Nikkei on the rise
and a wake-up call

01:09.286 --> 01:11.810
from your latest lover
or your best friend.

01:11.897 --> 01:12.811
[Blair]
'Again, Serena?'

01:12.898 --> 01:14.857
Good. You're up.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.815
[Blair on phone]
'Yes, I'm up.
Just like I was up yesterday

01:16.902 --> 01:18.339
'and the morning before that.'

01:18.426 --> 01:20.297
Well, after the whole
Carter/Chuck thing

01:20.384 --> 01:22.952
you can't blame me
for wanting to check in on you.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.346
'And as much as I appreciate
the concern, S'

01:25.433 --> 01:27.435
'my downward spiral
is on the upturn.'

01:27.522 --> 01:30.699
'I'm at home in my PJs, eating
French toast with Dorota.'

01:30.786 --> 01:32.266
[car horn honked]

01:32.353 --> 01:33.658
[male #1]
'Come on!'

01:33.745 --> 01:35.182
What was that?

01:35.269 --> 01:38.228
- 'Get off the phone!'
- Dorota has a cold.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.665
Dorota, I told you
not to use your handkerchief

01:40.752 --> 01:43.755
at the table.
It's disgusting.

01:43.842 --> 01:47.194
Oh, it sounded like a car horn.
It must have been on my end.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.630
Where are you?

01:48.717 --> 01:51.023
I'm on 73rd and Madison,
headed to via Quadronno

01:51.111 --> 01:53.809
'to get some pastries
for our new-family breakfast.'

01:53.896 --> 01:56.203
Well, uh, if I wasn't so full
on French toast

01:56.290 --> 01:58.988
I would ask you to bring
me one. See you at school.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.337
And tell Dorota
to feel better.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.341
♪ My baby has a baby boom box ♪♪

02:07.257 --> 02:10.826
I have here in my hands
my first fan letter.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.175
What, did you
write it yourself?

02:12.262 --> 02:14.308
No. No. "The New Yorker"
forwarded it to me.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.832
Some kid read my story.
He loved it.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.529
Sent me his own story.
I mean, he wants my opinion

02:18.616 --> 02:20.183
but I figured it'd be
good practice for Yale

02:20.270 --> 02:21.793
since they make you do a crit
with your classmates.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.665
Oh, a fan that
gives homework. Lovely.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.319
- Mm.
- What's this?

02:25.406 --> 02:27.669
[Daniel]
'It's my entry packet from Yale.
It came, too.'

02:27.756 --> 02:28.887
There's just a couple
more forms for you to fill out

02:28.974 --> 02:30.324
and then we're done.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.413
Look at us.
Everything's working out.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.938
You're in Yale and Jenny might
actually make it to 16.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.766
That was a little touch-and-go
there for a while.

02:37.853 --> 02:40.682
Yes, but I still have
24 hours to mess up, so..

02:40.769 --> 02:42.901
...uh, dad,
I don't smell coffee.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.338
Yeah, and the waffle iron
is cold.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.470
Oh, yeah.
Lily's doing breakfast today.

02:46.557 --> 02:48.472
- She wants to talk to us.
- Ominous.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.865
Or delicious,
I mean, do you know

02:49.952 --> 02:51.475
how many types of jam
they have there?

02:51.562 --> 02:52.781
[Rufus]
'Come on.
We're gonna be late.'

02:52.868 --> 02:54.130
It's a lot.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.178
[Dan]
'Hey. I'll be there
in a second.'

02:59.875 --> 03:01.703
Would you care to read
my fan letter in person?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.574
As happy as I am for you,
I'm a little freaked out.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.402
I gave Nate a week to call,
and he hasn't.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.317
Well, if I remember right
youleft him

03:07.404 --> 03:09.450
alone at a party
where he was being honored.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.886
Which I feel terrible about,
I just wish

03:10.973 --> 03:12.453
he would give me
a chance to apologize.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.455
Oh, he will,
when he's ready.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.630
[cellphone beeping]

03:15.717 --> 03:16.892
Oh.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.069
Okay.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.071
Did you just set me up?

03:22.158 --> 03:23.986
- What do you mean?
- Nate just sent me an e-mail.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.857
He wants me to meet him
at his place in a half-hour.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.338
Really?
Well, that I mean

03:28.425 --> 03:30.558
I was just winging it
but...that's good.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.954
- Serena, Hi!
- Poppy!

03:36.041 --> 03:38.740
- Oh, my gosh. Hey.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.132
I was beginning to think

03:40.220 --> 03:41.786
we weren't running
in the same circles anymore.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.136
It's been so long.
Cute coat.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.834
Oh, thanks.
You-you look great.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.228
I love your hair
and your tan.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.969
- We just got back from Spain.
- "We"?

03:51.056 --> 03:52.580
Yeah. Me and my
new boyfriend, Gabriel.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.538
He's so wonderful, Serena.
You'd love him.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.932
- I-I'd love to meet him.
- You should.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.151
But we're only in town
for 48 hours, though.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.675
Gabriel had to
come in for business

04:00.762 --> 04:02.242
but we're gonna fly
right back to Costa Brava

04:02.329 --> 04:04.026
on Sunday morning.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.897
So what about you?
What's new?

04:05.984 --> 04:07.725
- Seeing anybody?
- Uh, yeah.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.205
Dan and I
got back together

04:09.292 --> 04:11.425
but then we broke up again.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.078
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.603
And your friend,
what's her name? Blair?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.431
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?

04:17.518 --> 04:19.563
Uh, good now, there was
this thing between us

04:19.650 --> 04:21.348
but then we
worked it out, so..

04:21.435 --> 04:24.089
Wow. Well, it sounds like
everything's exactly the same

04:24.176 --> 04:25.743
as it was last time I saw you.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.789
Makes catching up
easier, though, right?

04:27.876 --> 04:30.835
Yeah. I-I'm throwing
a party this weekend.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.751
Really? Oh, what's the occasion?
Not that you need one.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.798
Oh, it's-it's for a friend.
It's for her sweet 16.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.279
Oh. That's sweet.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.370
Yeah. Uh, you should come.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.546
Yeah. I'll, um, I have
to check my schedule

04:45.633 --> 04:47.069
but I'll let you know.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.027
- Yeah. Please-please do.
- Okay.

04:49.114 --> 04:52.422
[gasps]
Well, um, have fun
with your little party

04:52.509 --> 04:55.686
and, um, just take care
of yourself, okay?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.427
- Okay.
- Bye.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.347
[Dan]
'Lily, I can't believe
you made us breakfast.'

05:04.434 --> 05:07.002
Oh, I just toasted some bagels
and fried some bacon.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.700
- And bought jam.
- Oh, really, it's no big deal.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.093
Well, if you turned on
a burner, Lil.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.964
- It's a big deal. Mwah.
- Mwah.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.836
You are really committed
to making this family work.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.838
- I'm proud of you, mom.
- Aw. Thank you.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.796
Oh, Charles, are you
staying for breakfast?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.232
I have an appointment.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.930
What does Chuck Bass do
at 8 a.m.?

05:22.017 --> 05:23.801
It's not like you work out.

05:23.888 --> 05:26.543
I do my cardio in the evenings
and morning is for business

05:26.630 --> 05:28.850
for which I am late.
So if you'll excuse me..

05:28.937 --> 05:30.591
Does this feel like a sitcom
to anybody else?

05:30.678 --> 05:34.029
- It feels like a reality show.
- Good. So I can vote you off.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.467
[scoffs]
It would almost be scary
if it wasn't wearing plaid.

05:37.554 --> 05:40.035
Um, wait, wait. You guys didn't
start without me, did you?

05:40.122 --> 05:41.210
You didn't tell her yet.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.864
- No!
- What? Tell me what?

05:42.951 --> 05:45.257
Well, we wanted to tell you
in person, all of you.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.609
We are planning a sweet 16 party
for you here, tomorrow night.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.786
Fantastic caterer
and beautiful flowers.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.918
DJ, the perfect guest list.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.398
We wanted it
to be a surprise, though.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
Well, we heard you had
one of those last year

05:56.878 --> 05:57.879
and it didn't go so well.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.446
Oh, Jenny Cake.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.882
Well, that's why this year,
I was more than happy

06:00.969 --> 06:03.363
to delegate to people
who know better.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.712
So what do you think?

06:06.278 --> 06:08.542
Uh...wow! I just..

06:10.326 --> 06:11.675
[chuckles]

06:11.762 --> 06:13.938
You're not excited?

06:14.025 --> 06:17.464
No, I am. I totally am.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.510
But...okay, look, last year

06:20.597 --> 06:22.338
I would have killed
for a party like this.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.774
But this year, I-I don't know.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.516
Things just, things
just seem different.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.910
'Li-like, okay, I was just kind
of hoping that it would be us'

06:28.997 --> 06:31.869
and Vanessa and Jonathan,
and then I don't even..

06:31.956 --> 06:33.871
Maybe those two girls
from my chem class

06:33.958 --> 06:36.657
who didn't light my hair
on fire that one time.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.662
[sighs]
I'm sorry. Is that okay?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.925
Ye-yeah. I mean, well, maybe you
should just try the cake first.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.579
Of course, it's okay.
It's your birthday.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.929
- It's whatever you want.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.932
No, it's not a problem.
I'll just, I'll cancel.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.587
I'm thinking my famous chili.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.066
Maybe some board games.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.549
Yeah, yeah,
um, but really

06:59.636 --> 07:01.246
thank you so much
for thinking of me.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.074
It means a lot.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.337
Um, I'll just go
cancel the caterer.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.167
I should
probably get to school.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.386
[Jenny clears throat]

07:12.780 --> 07:15.652
[instrumental music]

07:25.183 --> 07:27.055
I don't understand
why she wouldn't want it.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.883
Every culture in the world

07:28.970 --> 07:30.667
has some version
of a sweet 16 party.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.017
It's like a universal
rite of passage.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.237
Well, since she got back
to Constance

07:35.324 --> 07:37.021
Jenny hasn't exactly
made a lot of friends.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.371
You know, downsizing the party
might have something to do

07:39.459 --> 07:42.157
with the fear
that no one will show up.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.419
Serena.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.292
Word is out that
your party went

07:47.379 --> 07:49.207
from sixty to zero
in the last hour.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.558
[chuckles]
We knew you'd accept
defeat gracefully.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.124
What are you talking about?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.431
You canceled Jenny's party
to move off Penelope's date.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.739
Penelope's having a party
tomorrow night?

07:58.826 --> 08:00.958
- Since when?
- Since always.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.569
We were all going,
but at least now

08:02.656 --> 08:05.310
we don't have to pretend
to feel bad about missing yours.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.747
[Isabel]
'Hey, P.'

08:06.834 --> 08:09.271
Hey, girls. How excited
are you about the party?

08:09.358 --> 08:11.534
'I cannot wait.'

08:11.621 --> 08:15.582
Spotted. S, learning the answer
to the age-old question

08:15.669 --> 08:19.020
"what if you were throwing
a party and no one cared?"

08:19.107 --> 08:21.501
When that happens,
don't cancel.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.459
Poppy, hey. It's Serena.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
You know that party
I was telling you about?

08:25.592 --> 08:28.464
I was hoping we could meet up.
I need your help.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.770
Make them eat cake.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.730
[instrumental music]

08:54.925 --> 08:57.537
I see you got the e-mail
I sent from Nate's account.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.409
His password has been "soccer"
since the fifth grade.

09:00.496 --> 09:03.804
Look, Blair leaves his place
at this time every morning.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.414

No. I've just been spending
a lot of time with Nate.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.948
Oh. Where is this coming from?

19:27.035 --> 19:29.342
- What?
- You and Nate?

19:29.429 --> 19:30.952
After all
that you've been through?

19:31.039 --> 19:33.781
You sure it's not just
because Nate's not Chuck?

19:33.868 --> 19:37.176
I thought Chuck was my future,
Nate a part of my juvenile past

19:37.263 --> 19:39.961
but...now I'm thinking.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.658
Chuck was just something
I had to get out of my system

19:41.745 --> 19:45.706
in order to realize...Nate
was my destiny all along.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.142
[Serena on phone]
'Well, if that's
really how you feel'

19:47.229 --> 19:48.709
then I'm happy for you.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.015
It's not exactly
like I was rooting for Chuck

19:51.102 --> 19:52.887
and Nate is good
for you. No drama.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.891
Nate and I
have plenty of drama

19:56.978 --> 19:59.372
and sparks and fireworks.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.765
Uh-huh. When are you
getting to my party?

20:01.852 --> 20:03.289
You mean Jenny's party.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.378
[knock on door]

20:05.465 --> 20:07.945
So do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.643
[Serena on phone]
'B, I gotta go. I'm sorry.'

20:11.122 --> 20:12.428
Jenny's gonna love it.

20:18.521 --> 20:19.696
Hey, Vanya.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.048
"Guilty, Liberal victims
and their assault on America"

20:24.135 --> 20:25.789
by Ann Coulter?

20:25.876 --> 20:29.140
Dorota gave to me. She said
important to know enemy.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.186
It's okay.
I read to make Dorota happy.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.626
- I have to say, I'm excited.
- Oh, you should be.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.063
Dad only makes his chili
on very special occasions.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.543
Well, not just
about my birthday.

20:40.630 --> 20:43.851
I mean, of course about
my birthday, but, you know

20:43.938 --> 20:46.897
'Lily and dad
and all of us together?'

20:46.984 --> 20:49.465
I don't know. Things just seem
to be going really good.

20:49.552 --> 20:50.901
Yeah. A little too good.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.775
What? Since when
is "good" too good?

20:57.908 --> 20:58.996
Dan?

20:59.083 --> 21:00.868
[sighs]

21:00.955 --> 21:04.132
Uh, y-you know that phone call
that wasn't Vanessa?

21:04.219 --> 21:06.221
It was a real estate agent.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.918
I think dad might be
selling the loft.

21:08.005 --> 21:11.400
What? No.
Where would we live?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.793
Well, I'd be at college.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.621
I guess you and,
you and dad would be..

21:14.708 --> 21:18.581
[gasps]
...moving on up
to the East Side.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.628
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky-y-y.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.586
Okay, yeah, yeah,
funny, first of all

21:23.673 --> 21:26.241
you need to stop watching
so many old sitcoms on Hulu

21:26.328 --> 21:27.851
and second,
dad on the Upper East Side?

21:27.938 --> 21:30.114
I mean, there's no way.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.160
No, we can't
live up here. We're..

21:32.247 --> 21:35.337
- Humphreys.
- Damn straight.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.383
[chuckles]

21:37.470 --> 21:39.602
We grew up good.
You know that?

21:39.689 --> 21:40.690
Yeah.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.391
[Hearts Revolution singing
"Dance Till Dawn"]

21:54.182 --> 21:56.967
Okay. It looks
familiar..

21:57.054 --> 21:58.665
...and yet..

21:58.752 --> 22:01.363
- Not bad, Little J.
- What are you doing here?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.496
Once I heard Poppy Lifton
was coming to your party

22:03.583 --> 22:05.715
I canceled mine.
In the last 20 minutes

22:05.802 --> 22:08.588
I've been hit on by two
Bronfmans and a gay designer.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.024
It was so worth it.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.592
Kudos on rising
from the social grave.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.856
Speaking of graves,
did something die in that pot?

22:19.163 --> 22:20.817
It's cumin.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.603
I liked my social grave.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.345
I dug it myself
and I was happy to lie in it.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.390
What's going on?
Why are they here?

22:28.477 --> 22:30.349
I don't know.
This chili weighs a ton, though.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.438
I need to,
I need to find a caterer.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.922
[music continues]

22:40.446 --> 22:42.143
Jenny, hey.
I didn't see you come in.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.798
How could you with all this
fabulous going on? Well done.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.321
Happy birthday, Jenny.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.672
Poppy, I didn't
expect to see you.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.457
Hey, uh, will you
get us some drinks?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.023
Sure.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.722
- Well, surprised?
- Confused.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.289
I mean, what is all this?
Where's my dad and Lily?

They're at "Billy Elliot,"
fifth row center.

only turns 16 once

with her friends

23:03.469 --> 23:06.341
and friends of friends.
My present to you.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.256
Serena, I didn't want this.

Well, I thought you
didn't want a social fiasco

where-where you planned
something and people

23:12.216 --> 23:14.610
didn't show up,
but this is perfect.

intimate family gathering.

cocktail napkin.

Serena hijack my birthday?

Well, I know she was trying
to do something nice for you.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.556
Maybe she just got
a little carried away.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.210
And maybe she wanted
to prove to everyone

23:49.297 --> 23:51.038
she could still throw
a great party.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.869
Well...if she wants
people to know

for myself

is sleazy platitudes and..

several excellent ideas.

You just shot
most of them down.

they all involved

sex tape to the internet.

We don't have to leak the tape
if you don't want to.

who should know better

Trust me, I would love
to get out of here right now.

with the table dancers first.

with you later.

Um, they're not crashing,
Serena. I invited them.

Well, you have your guest list,
and I have mine.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.564
Yeah, but-but this
can't be what you want.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.478
Like you care what I want.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.785
Jenny, I genuinely thought that
when you got off the elevator

26:09.872 --> 26:11.918
you would be thrilled and
if you weren't then I'm sorry

26:12.005 --> 26:13.441
but you should have
just said something.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.703

and you clearly--

26:14.790 --> 26:16.270
Serena, um..

26:16.357 --> 26:17.967
It's fine. Jenny and I
are just having our first fight.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.448
There are strangers
having sex in your bed.

26:20.535 --> 26:21.928
Oh, my God.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.497
Wait. Did you get that
out of my mother's closet?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.891
The word he used was,
uh, uh, "haunting."

26:28.978 --> 26:30.676
"A haunting sense
f immediacy."

in the middle of something.

in the middle of something else.

26:46.735 --> 26:47.997
We're not a couple.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.346
It's just physical.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.654
I'll take your word for it.

But listen, whatever's
going on between you two..

doesn't talk you into

Whatever's going on
with Chuck wasn't his idea.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.318
It was mine, and at least he
doesn't pretend to be one thing

27:04.405 --> 27:05.798
when really he's another.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.365
You said
there was no one else.

There's not.

Nothing's happened between us.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.371
Well, not yet.

But he's telling you
the truth.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.681
Nate's a good guy.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.292
If you'd have seen that,
maybe you'd still be together.

Now that he's free,
who knows what will happen?

27:24.294 --> 27:26.557
Exactly. We don't know.
We're just hanging out.

at parties, hang out.

- But later, when we're alone--
- Blair!

27:32.172 --> 27:34.565
- We'll talk about it.
- What is there to talk about?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.306
Okay, do you guys want
to have this conversation

27:36.393 --> 27:37.873
somewhere else, alone?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.875
Why are you
still standing here?

27:44.619 --> 27:46.926
Blair, what are we
doing in here?

27:47.013 --> 27:48.667
You're not leaving
this room until we find out

if we're really just friends.

Well, don't just stare at me.
Do something.

[gasps]
Blair, stop acting
like me being your friend

28:01.680 --> 28:04.247
is some kind of plot
to humiliate you, okay?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.990
Did you ever think that maybe
things didn't work out

28:08.077 --> 28:10.558
between us because
we weren't friends?

28:14.214 --> 28:16.259
You're right, Nate.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.914
This week,
you've become my friend.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.048
It's amazing.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.660
And I've never wanted to kiss
my friend so much--

We're at a party full of people
in Chuck's room

28:29.708 --> 28:32.101
and he and Vanessa are
right behind the wall.

- Doesn't it excite you?
- Blair..

Don't.

'They have been
in there for a while.'

28:56.822 --> 28:59.128
What if, all we did is
push 'em closer together?

28:59.215 --> 29:02.436
You just need to relax
and trust in the power

29:02.523 --> 29:04.394
of our overwhelming
sexual chemistry

29:04.481 --> 29:06.179
to drive a wedge between.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.763
It looks like
that went well.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.852
You wanted to be
more like Blair Waldorf?

29:26.939 --> 29:30.159
Well, congratulations.
You succeeded.

what they want without losing

like their integrity.

- Ew! Gross!

Jenny would turn

29:45.435 --> 29:48.351
this sophisticated soiree
in-into a teenage rager.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.701
Well, you did turn her
scrabble and sloppy Joe party

29:50.789 --> 29:52.660
into a sophisticated
soiree, so..

29:52.747 --> 29:55.576
You know not that the punishment

been somewhat conscious

you would sabotage it?

31:28.843 --> 31:30.497
Things definitely
got out of hand

31:30.584 --> 31:32.412

is that the kids are okay.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.370
Yes, well, that may be
the mostimportant thing

a few phone calls.
