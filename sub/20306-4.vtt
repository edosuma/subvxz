NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.461 --> 00:06.506
Welcome Randall Buttman
and Lawrence Swann.

00:06.589 --> 00:07.549
I'm Buttman. (clicks tongue)

00:07.632 --> 00:10.719
I get a rush off of you
I haven't felt for a long time.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.095
Do you want to take me home now?

00:12.178 --> 00:13.471
Word gets out fast

00:13.555 --> 00:15.890
about how many feathers you managed
to ruffle your first day on the job.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.018
Hey, I don't have an egg outfit, sir.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.686
My husband's been murdered.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.105
(stuttering) L-Let m-me go.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.232
(mocking) Are you s-s-sure, Larry?

00:25.358 --> 00:27.694
STAN:<i> Item six, prostitute killing.</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:30.321
Hooker in Midtown was killed last night.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.532
It's the fifth in five weeks.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.826
The MO is consistent.

00:35.452 --> 00:39.164
Woman's in her apartment,
bludgeoned and strangled.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.833
Points to some john doing it,

00:42.751 --> 00:46.087
uh, but so far, this is all we've got
from the one survivor:

00:46.546 --> 00:49.758
Male, Cauc, 18-to-25, short hair.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.678
It's not much to go on.
Midtown's running the show, but...

00:54.471 --> 00:56.890
let's keep our eyes peeled
in the hooker corridors, okay?

00:58.725 --> 00:59.559
Item seven:

01:00.185 --> 01:03.229
Falling plaster in your bathroom, ladies.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.858
Spread the word.
There is no peephole involved.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.652
-Anything like that. No, no.
-(overlapping chatter)

01:09.736 --> 01:11.696
No, it's just dry rot. That's all.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.534
Next item. Day two, Operation Drumstick.

01:16.618 --> 01:20.330
Uh... Mick Belker undercover
against fast food robberies.

01:20.789 --> 01:25.043
Today's post, Uncle Fryer
number three, 116th and Utica.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.297
Used to be a candy store, if I remember.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.383
Now, Mick, I know
you're not gonna toot your own horn,

01:32.467 --> 01:35.345
but how many cops tossed into jail
by some wacko judge

01:35.428 --> 01:39.057
would have the presence of mind
to overhear a chance remark

01:39.140 --> 01:42.894
and turn it into a capture
of a murder one suspect?

01:42.977 --> 01:45.480
-Huh?
-(applause)

01:45.772 --> 01:48.024
That's a good job, detective.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.073
Reminding all personnel,
there's a lecture here--

01:55.156 --> 01:59.035
Um, end of tour tomorrow,
guy from Legal Division

01:59.369 --> 02:01.955
is, uh, gonna tell us
about how the Supreme Court's

02:02.038 --> 02:05.166
taking the handcuffs off
on search and seizure.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.085
Let's see how we can make this work...

02:09.963 --> 02:10.922
work for us.

02:13.716 --> 02:14.843
I just got this.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.140
Patrolman Lawrence Swann, rookie...

02:21.933 --> 02:23.852
rode with Sergeant Bates yesterday.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.398
He hung himself this a.m.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.609
In regards to this,

02:32.443 --> 02:34.988
Sergeant Bates, Officers Hill and Buttman,

02:35.321 --> 02:37.657
Detective Washington
report to Captain Furillo

02:37.991 --> 02:39.576
in his office at 0730 hours.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.457
Well, what do you say?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.881
Let's get out there. Let's do it
to them before they do it to us.

02:57.594 --> 03:02.307
(indistinct chatter)

03:07.187 --> 03:09.564
"I have been violated,
shamed and humiliated

03:09.647 --> 03:11.482
by people I thought were my friends.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.485
How in hell am I supposed
to live with that?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.030
How can I face people every day

03:17.113 --> 03:19.324
who were making jokes
about me behind my back?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.408
I'm better off dead.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.328
I'm just finishing
what the rest of you started."

03:24.204 --> 03:26.289
And then in a separate note
to the aunt who raised him:

03:27.415 --> 03:30.001
"You're better off without me.
All I would have brought you is disgrace.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.628
I love you. I'm sorry. I can't explain."

03:31.711 --> 03:34.339
What the hell went on in that
back room last night, Buttman?

03:34.923 --> 03:35.840
What's Swann referring to?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.301
Honest to God,
it was just a party, Captain.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.637
I don't know
what he's talking about there.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.098
Neal, the manager says
he had to ask you and Bobby

03:44.182 --> 03:46.142
-to cool it down.
-And we did, Captain.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.813
-Did you see Swann at all?
-No.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.733
Illegal activities of any kind?

03:54.192 --> 03:56.986
Can't prove it.
Didn't see money exchange hands,

03:57.070 --> 04:01.157
but in my opinion, Officer Buttman
was with a prostitute.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.952
The girl she's referring to is Lois,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.246
and she told me she worked
for the telephone company.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.957
-In what capacity?
-Sir, I don't know.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.126
If she was a prostitute,
she didn't ask me for any money.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.504
At any time during the evening
did you see her with Swann?

04:15.838 --> 04:16.756
No, sir, I did not.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.008
There'll be a full investigation.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.469
Lucy, I want an hourly
on your tour with Swann yesterday.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.806
Buttman, I want a 7-16 on everything
you did and saw at the Kubiak.

04:25.139 --> 04:25.974
Yes, sir.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.352
Neal, did you see this individual
last night?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.855
-Yeah, for a second.
-Find her.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.901
FAY: Sick! Sick individual.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.362
Now, don't think I don't see
you up there, mister!

04:39.821 --> 04:43.366
Okay, that's it! I won't stand for this!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.451
This squad room should be kept on a leash!

04:45.535 --> 04:48.496
Uh, anything--
anything wrong, Mrs. Furillo?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.748
When a woman can't enjoy the simple right

04:50.832 --> 04:53.626
to privacy in the bathroom,
I should say there is!

04:53.918 --> 04:55.837
There was somebody looking down at me.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.882
-Where from?
-Where else? The ceiling!

05:00.174 --> 05:01.301
I looked up, I heard a sound,

05:01.384 --> 05:03.011
there's an eyeball staring
right down at me.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.178
Yeah, I've heard it, too.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.264
But, Mrs. Furillo, who could be up there?

05:07.056 --> 05:10.727
My guess is some pervert crawling around,
looking for thrills.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.147
Maintenance isn't due till 2:00.
No visitors are logged in.

05:14.230 --> 05:18.026
Uh, you sure it couldn't
have been insects or maybe a large rodent?

05:18.359 --> 05:20.570
(loud crash)

05:26.117 --> 05:27.744
With glasses?

05:28.202 --> 05:30.330
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:32.373
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:32.457 --> 05:36.252
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:38.004
(sirens wailing)

05:43.468 --> 05:46.095
(theme music playing)

06:58.459 --> 06:59.836
HARRY: SID will cover the precincts.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.671
-Every rookie who was at the Kubiak.
-Good.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.589
Let's get somebody interviewing over
at the Lodge.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.883
And I want Swann's records
from the academy.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.885
Employment applications,
medical, everything.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.512
Maybe his high school files as well?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.848
Yeah, but first the academy.
Let's try to round up Howard.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.349
I want to talk to all of you in a minute.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.982
-Chief?
-Pity, huh, Frank?

07:21.482 --> 07:22.358
Just a pity.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.610
Promising young life like this?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.990
-Dreadful.
-Now, I'll have to make a statement.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.284
Mind if I get a gander at the swan song?

07:31.909 --> 07:33.202
Swann's suicide note.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.498
"Rookie Hangs Self After Hazing"
makes page one, Frank.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.794
It's crucial we not appear
to be sitting around on our thumbs.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.671
It may not have been a hazing, Chief.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.299
Hazing usually requires senior officers.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.927
Frank, you don't believe that
and neither do I.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.598
Know what I do think?
This Larry Swann was a wimp.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.601
Hazing's as old as the hills,<i> mon </i>friend.

07:57.518 --> 08:01.397
Hell, when I came up, we had a party.
Nurses from St. Mary's.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.443
I passed out on purple passions
with a damsel in a DeSoto.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.905
Woke up handcuffed
to a hydrant out in Farmingdale,

08:08.988 --> 08:10.990
naked right down to my jockstrap.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.201
And I didn't commit suicide.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.165
Full-bore, Frank.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.509
I'm absolutely sure I'm gonna score,
all right? So then--

08:30.051 --> 08:31.427
How's your homicide coming?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.555
Warren Reynolds? No witness, no weapon.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
It's going nowhere fast.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.767
Understand the victim's wife
was in here yesterday.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.645
Yeah, it was an unrelated incident.
I put her statement on your desk.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.813
-Is she a suspect?
-Nothing points to her.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.733
Personally,
I think she's hiding something.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.651
Then follow it up.

08:48.945 --> 08:49.779
Uh, Captain?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.115
Look, uh, I was with her last night.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.036
-With whom?
-The victim's wife, Caroline Reynolds.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.748
"With" her?

09:01.916 --> 09:03.876
I was there when she got
the call about her husband.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.419
I know how it's got to look, Captain.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.047
Woman's car gets busted into,
I pull her case,

09:08.130 --> 09:09.215
we wind up between the sheets

09:09.298 --> 09:11.008
and her husband gets whacked
that same night.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.844
If it seemed like she was trying
to hide something, that was it.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
She thought I'd get in trouble
with the department.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.682
What you do in your time
is your business, J.D.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.351
We don't have a policy
to cover something like this.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.936
(scoffs) Neither do I.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.480
You might want to consider
not seeing her anymore,

09:24.564 --> 09:26.357
until after the investigation's finished.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.568
And I'd like you to give a statement.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.154
Absolutely. I've got nothing to hide, sir.

09:32.780 --> 09:33.614
Good.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.369
How about I go write this up for you guys?

09:38.744 --> 09:39.912
Yeah, that'd be good, J.D.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.209
What?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.587
I'm gonna run the wife.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.046
Just for the hell of it.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.173
FRANK: Gentlemen?

09:53.342 --> 09:55.761
Uh, I just received word last night

09:55.845 --> 09:59.807
that the precinct has been awarded
a federal study grant.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.809
Ah, congratulations, Frank.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.144
-Very good.
-What's the agenda?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.104
Well, its stated objective

10:05.187 --> 10:08.357
is compilation of data in order to adjudge

10:08.441 --> 10:10.901
the feasibility of local
law enforcement interaction

10:10.985 --> 10:13.654
with constituent civilian
patrol organizations

10:13.738 --> 10:17.116
in the behavioral management
of high-profile recidivists.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.909
Our federal tax dollars at work.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.244
What does it mean?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.957
It means we're supposed to try
to pull together statistics

10:25.041 --> 10:27.001
to see if neighborhood watch groups

10:27.084 --> 10:29.712
can help us keep tabs
on hardcore repeat offenders.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.548
-It runs, um, six months.
-A real boondoggle.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.427
There are also $6,000
in the budget for a program administrator.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.846
And in the interest of fairness,
I'd like to suggest

10:38.929 --> 10:41.307
that the three of you split
the responsibilities and the money.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.643
-We agreed?
-Sure, why not?

10:43.726 --> 10:46.062
Well, I don't know, Frank,
um, do you think it's wise,

10:46.145 --> 10:48.773
a troika for, uh, all that paperwork?

10:48.856 --> 10:50.983
Come on, Howard,
two grand just fell in your pocket.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.486
And I'm saying that given
the specifications, maybe...

10:53.569 --> 10:55.696
maybe it is properly a one-man job.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.658
(clears throat)
Forgive me, Frank, but I also agree

10:58.741 --> 11:01.077
that a program of this nature
demands the effort

11:01.160 --> 11:02.870
of a single, dedicated administrator.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.747
And the money has nothing to do with it?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.416
-That's right.
-Fine, you do it. I'll keep the 2,000.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.585
-All right, hold on.
-I'm sorry, that's how I feel.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.672
Since we can't seem
to get together on this,

11:12.755 --> 11:14.006
I'm gonna have to choose one of you.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.925
I'll give you my decision
at the end of business.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.844
Frank, uh, can I have a look
at the correspondence?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.179
Ah... May I also?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.641
I'll have some copies made.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.524
She's beautiful, she's smart,
she's sensitive.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.275
She's an amazing lover.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.611
Not to mention
that she just struck it rich. (chuckles)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.863
I got one thing to whisper to you, J.D.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.783
(whispers) Tax-free municipal bond.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.326
Hey, are we jealous here or what?

11:42.827 --> 11:46.580
J.D., I'm gonna remind you once
that this beautiful and sensitive woman

11:46.664 --> 11:49.291
that you're so deeply in love with
didn't tell you the truth about like--

11:50.126 --> 11:52.586
Like, for openers,
the fact that she's married.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.715
Hey, I'm not denying
we got a few things to clear up, Neal,

11:55.798 --> 11:58.092
but come on, this can be
the most meaningful relationship

11:58.175 --> 11:59.385
I ever had in my life.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.972
Well, I think till the dust settles,
you should be single, lover.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.306
Yeah, I'm gonna take her to lunch.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.350
I'm gonna tell her exactly the same thing.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.812
What's going on, Joe? Here you go, honey.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.107
That van is still out there, Bobby.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.193
-Which one?
-The one we saw this morning

12:16.277 --> 12:19.155
when we come out that place,
Doreen's on Central E?

12:19.697 --> 12:20.531
Blue van?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.241
There was a lot of vans out
on the street there, Renko.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.536
(sighs) In the meantime, I have a feeling
I'm being followed all morning long.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.957
Darlin', can you put two more
of them fried cakes in my order, please?

12:30.040 --> 12:30.875
BOBBY: Some ice water, too.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.210
Did you find Buttman's party girl?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.670
Negative. She's not in the books.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.838
And no rookies came forward?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.548
I just came from Polk Avenue.
I was out on patrol.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.591
I'm looking for him now.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.800
Don't hold your breath.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.762
So where's Buttman?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.222
Said he had to run a couple errands.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.515
How long's he been gone?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.310
I don't know, about a half-hour.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.646
-And you gave him the unit?
-Said he'd be back in ten minutes.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.648
So what if we have an all-units?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.317
Come on, Luce,
don't start pulling rank on me, all right?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.486
Hey, I'll pull rank when I have to,
it's my job.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.490
Sorry, Joe, the line was a mile long.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.575
Where the hell have you been, Buttman?

13:05.743 --> 13:06.619
I was at the bank.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.123
-Did you notify the station?
-I cleared it with Joe.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.292
Yeah, you ask me,
you were out there clearing

13:13.375 --> 13:14.919
your lame story with your buddies.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.003
-Hey!
-Go ahead, say something,

13:16.086 --> 13:17.630
like it's my time of month.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.839
JOE: Come on, take it easy, Luce.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.592
Am I missing something here?

13:22.301 --> 13:25.471
Is this get Buttman? Crucify Buttman?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.182
The kid I was partnered with yesterday
is dead on account

13:28.265 --> 13:30.351
-of something you're covering up.
-Hey, that's out of line!

13:30.434 --> 13:31.936
-You've got no proof--
-I don't need proof

13:32.019 --> 13:33.521
to know something that happened.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.481
The guy I saw at the Kubiak last night

13:35.564 --> 13:37.399
was not gonna go home and kill himself.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.612
Well, I guess you were wrong about that.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.364
You're on report, Buttman.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.701
For leaving patrol without authorization.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.497
Fine. And I'm filing
a harassment complaint.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.748
I don't need to put up with this--

13:52.832 --> 13:55.376
-Hey, hey, little boy. Quiet down, there.
-Hey, Luce! Luce!

13:55.459 --> 13:56.919
Great, it's in your jacket, babe.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.964
What's the matter with her,
she doesn't like men?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.216
Hey, do me a favor, would you? Shut up.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.178
She just started it.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.057
You're a fried egg until 10:00.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.142
You get a half-hour break
and then you're a chicken.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.104
-Fine.
-These are for our new breakfast specials.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.064
Egg's low profile.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.733
It's easy going.
It's sunny, you know what I mean?

14:19.817 --> 14:22.736
-Yeah, I think so.
-People are grouchy this early,

14:22.820 --> 14:24.738
so just hand out the coupons and smile.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.950
And you don't want me
to say breakfast bonanza at Uncle Fryers?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.201
Oh, say it, sure.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.328
Relax. Let the costume work for you.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.581
-MAN: Hey, Moe, phone call.
-I'll be right there.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.708
-You all set?
-Oh, yeah.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.126
(giggles) You look good.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.131
Breakfast bonanza at Uncle Fryers.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.216
Free medium-sized coffee.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.136
Breakfast bonanza,
right here at Uncle Fryers.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.721
Medium-sized coffee.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.973
-Breakfast bonanza--
-Don't come near me.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.559
Don't you touch me. Get a job!

14:53.642 --> 14:55.561
-Damn doggone nut--
-(growls)

15:03.819 --> 15:06.155
-Hey, yo, Ronnie. Ronnie Garfield.
-RONNIE: Yeah?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.698
Neal Washington, Hill Street.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.159
I saw you in the back room
of that party last night.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.578
-You opened the door.
-Yeah, I remember.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.787
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.789
Hey, look, I just talked to I.A.D.

15:15.873 --> 15:16.916
I just told them what went down.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.167
I just spent two hours with them.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.587
I'm looking for a girl who was back there,
a hooker by the name of Lois.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.589
I didn't see any hookers.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.050
I mean, I feel real bad
for Larry and I'm real sorry

15:26.133 --> 15:28.177
and I wish I could do something for him,
but I can't.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.680
Listen to me, man. I know all about
codes of silence, you understand?

15:32.222 --> 15:34.308
I know all the extra is
because you're a rookie.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.392
Because you're Black.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.394
Now, you seem like a good kid.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.605
Now, you want to do something
to help Swann?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.440
At least help me find this girl.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.318
I never saw her before a day in my life.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.446
-Did Buttman bring her?
-I don't know who brought her. I'm sorry.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.073
Look, I don't know one thing about her.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.885
Most guys gonna do themselves in,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.888
they wait couple years,
let things stack up on 'em.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.599
I don't know what you could pack
into one day on the job

16:15.683 --> 16:17.685
make you wanna take the necktie transfer.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.853
Must've had a lot going on in his mind.

16:19.937 --> 16:24.024
Whoo! He must've had a non-stop circus
of horrors with extra added attractions.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.569
We got ourselves two jellies
back there, didn't we?

16:28.362 --> 16:30.239
You're really packin' it away, Renko.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.157
Medicinal purposes, Bobby Hill.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.118
-Ah.
-Ever since that baby's come,

16:34.493 --> 16:36.578
my biorhythm's have been in transition.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.833
My little Carol Anne's like a lunatic
with this post-mortem depression stuff.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.751
(chuckles) It's "post-partum,"
I think, isn't it?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.712
All I know is every time I look at her,

16:45.963 --> 16:47.881
she starts turning on the faucets

16:48.298 --> 16:50.217
like somebody just killed her dog.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.678
Man can't stay regular
in an environment like that.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.680
Look. Look behind us right now.
Is that it?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.891
-I don't know, I see it.
-The van that we saw this morning.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.809
-Yeah?
-Think we're being tailed?

16:59.768 --> 17:02.730
Well, with all the hardened criminals
we've put away over the years,

17:02.813 --> 17:05.232
-I guess it's a strong possibility.
-I got an idea.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.358
What?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.491
All right, that tears it.
Follow this, sucker.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.701
-(siren wails)
-Hey, where are you going,

17:15.784 --> 17:16.744
Renko, what are you doing?

17:17.911 --> 17:20.581
(tires squealing)

17:27.921 --> 17:29.465
All right, get out that van, everybody!

17:29.548 --> 17:31.467
-Get out that van, lady, step out here.
-Excuse me, officer--

17:31.550 --> 17:32.926
Don't aggravate me, lady,
let's see what you got here.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.553
Officer, if you'd just let me explain--

17:34.636 --> 17:36.597
What the hell is this?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.849
Lynn Williams, Investigative Action Team.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.601
Barry, show the officers some ID.

17:40.684 --> 17:41.935
RENKO: Investigative Action Team?

17:42.019 --> 17:43.604
Hey, you're on Channel Three, aren't you?

17:43.687 --> 17:47.024
That's right. I guess we're better off
leaving the undercover stuff to you guys.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.650
Investigative Action Team.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.362
-I seen you. I seen you do them reports.
-The<i> Morning Reports.</i>

17:52.446 --> 17:54.615
Right. You did one on some firemen, right?

17:54.698 --> 17:57.284
That was part of our series
on city employee productivity.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.536
Right. What'd you call that, reporter?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.663
It's called
"The Seats of City Government."

18:01.747 --> 18:05.375
"The Seats of City Government."
Isn't that clever?

18:05.876 --> 18:08.670
Isn't that clever, Bobby Hill?
"The Seats of City Government."

18:08.962 --> 18:10.631
So what the hell are you doing
following us around, lady?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.674
-You trying to catch us goofing off?
-Not at all.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.802
-Hey, Renko--
-If I recall correctly,

18:14.885 --> 18:17.179
there's a couple of individuals
from the Sanitation Department

18:17.262 --> 18:18.764
got fired after one of your hatchet jobs.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.642
They were spending their afternoons
in a massage parlor.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.977
-There's a lot of tension in them jobs!
-Renko, take it easy.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.438
How do you take out your tension,
officer? Donuts?

18:26.522 --> 18:30.234
Our contract specifically calls
for a morning coffee break!

18:30.317 --> 18:33.153
Oh come on, four donut shops
in two and a half hours?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.197
Show 'em this! Show 'em this, lady!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.490
-Hey, wait, wait--
-You see this?

18:36.573 --> 18:38.158
I was in a hospital for six weeks

18:38.242 --> 18:41.036
with tubes running out my body
'cause I was doing my job,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.539
and I will eat my donuts
whenever and wherever

18:43.622 --> 18:45.290
the spirit moves me, thank you very much!

18:45.666 --> 18:47.209
Guy thinks he's LBJ.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.503
How'd you like it if I came sat down
next to you and did some filming

18:49.586 --> 18:50.921
every time you went to the powder room

18:51.004 --> 18:52.631
or went up there
and get some water or something?

18:52.714 --> 18:54.967
-How'd you like that, lady?
-Uh... ma'am, I think it best

18:55.050 --> 18:57.594
-if you didn't follow us around anymore.
-You can bet on that.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.013
Nice talking to you, officer.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.853
Get this vehicle off the road.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.437
Bobby Hill.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.774
Bobby Hill!

19:17.614 --> 19:18.448
Hey, Buttman.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.702
I'm gonna give you one more chance
to make this right.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.328
Where's Lois?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.373
You know, guy, you really are good
with that toothpick.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.917
I like that. (clicks tongue)

19:29.710 --> 19:30.669
Come on, Buttman.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.339
You make this too easy, Buttman.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.051
Jennings of I.A.D. says there's nothing
on the girl from any of the rookies.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.428
Buttman's lying, Captain.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.138
I'm gonna check out the mug books.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.558
Captain, Lieutenant Harmon, I.A.D.,
line two.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.603
-Thanks, Stan.
-Frank, a minute?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.813
-Sure, Howard.
-You know, I've been thinking about it,

19:49.897 --> 19:53.317
and I would like to make a real pitch
for this federal study idea.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.360
It seems to me there's a kernel
of a notion here

19:55.444 --> 19:57.946
that could galvanize
our... our civilian population

19:58.030 --> 20:00.908
into a self-patrolling resource
of unprecedented nature--

20:00.991 --> 20:03.869
Howard, do you think maybe
you could just put this into writing?

20:04.578 --> 20:06.163
Oh, sure. Sure, why not?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.883
Oh, Judas Priest!

20:18.842 --> 20:20.552
Now, you listen to me, Bobby Hill.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.764
What, with wild parties,

20:23.847 --> 20:25.349
and rookies debasing themselves,

20:25.432 --> 20:29.061
you don't think the top brass
is gonna be disposed to a witch hunt?

20:29.144 --> 20:30.562
You'll give yourself an ulcer, Renko.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.774
I'm telling you, if we are seen
eating our weight in donuts

20:33.857 --> 20:37.945
on the television set in this city,
we're gonna be hung out to dry.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.363
I only had one, pal.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.449
(laughs) Don't sweat it, Renko.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.117
Maybe your belly will scare her off.

20:44.826 --> 20:48.205
I am looking toward a future
that is clouded with uncertainty,

20:48.288 --> 20:51.208
newly married, newly fathered
and now newly fired.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.417
Would you just shut up?

20:53.460 --> 20:54.920
I'm gonna take care of it.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.549
What you gonna do?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.260
I'm gonna reason with the woman.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.095
If that doesn't work, I'll try honesty.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.182
-What if that don't work?
-I don't know.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.769
If my back's against the wall,
there's no telling what I might do.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.855
Yes, hello there, is, uh...
is Lynn Williams there?

21:17.901 --> 21:20.404
-Oh, Frank.
-Yeah, Ray?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.990
I've gone through Swann's
police academy folder.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.950
-And?
-Everything is in order.

21:25.033 --> 21:28.036
His stammer was noted,
but judged within tolerable limits

21:28.120 --> 21:30.414
and unlikely to jeopardize
patrol effectiveness.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.999
Anybody over there ever do an in-depth?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.084
-Apparently not.
-Thanks, Ray.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.211
Frank?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.299
About this administrative job...

21:41.216 --> 21:42.050
Yeah, Ray?

21:43.218 --> 21:45.429
I did not want to speak to you
in front of Howard and Henry

21:45.512 --> 21:47.556
for fear of appearing self-serving.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.516
-(shuts drawer)
-I understand.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.603
Well, there are three things
I would like to say:

21:54.438 --> 21:57.232
One, I would very much like
to have this job.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.319
I believe I can modestly claim

22:00.402 --> 22:02.821
that my experience
with our computer systems

22:02.904 --> 22:05.991
-makes me the most qualified.
-That's a good point.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.285
Two, and I don't mean to be critical,

22:08.952 --> 22:12.289
but given the number of plums
that have gone to others in our precinct,

22:12.956 --> 22:15.459
perhaps it is fair that
one should now come to me.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.795
Three, we have just been told
that Rosa's cousin,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.297
Yolanda, in Miami Beach,

22:20.380 --> 22:23.550
she is seriously ill, and needs money
for medical treatments.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.679
I'm not here with hats in my hands,
I'm simply stating facts.

22:29.931 --> 22:34.102
Gee, Ray, I'm sorry about Rosa's cousin.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.480
Thanks, Frank. That's all I have to say.

22:38.940 --> 22:42.152
Frank, as we discussed.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.072
-Thanks, Howard.
-Ray.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.449
If you would like me to put
something in writing--

22:47.532 --> 22:49.910
Uh, no, no, no, you made
a very persuasive case, Ray.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.286
I'm glad you think so.

22:51.578 --> 22:54.539
Captain, line four,
Logan from the Heights.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.540
Thanks, Stan.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.877
Furillo. Yeah, bud.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.755
Thanks, bud.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.218
Another hooker homicide
over in the Heights.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.844
Same MO as the others?

23:07.928 --> 23:10.013
Her name was Lois. Lois Jordan.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.599
Stan, raise Neal for me,
would you, please?

23:12.682 --> 23:14.768
Get him over there, see if it's the
same girl we've been looking for.

23:14.851 --> 23:15.685
Yes, sir.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.896
Okay, okay. Let's move it, folks.
Come on, let's move it back now.

23:17.979 --> 23:18.814
Come on, come on.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.525
-Where is she?
-Dead, where else?

23:22.025 --> 23:23.944
Nude. Clothes were on the chair.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.952
-Friend of yours?
-Yeah, right.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.079
-Hey, thanks, Rollie.
-MAN: Let's go, clear it away.

23:34.913 --> 23:38.208
Uncle Fryers, free soft drink
with every breast you buy.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.668
There you go, lady.

23:39.751 --> 23:44.005
Uncle Fryers, free soft drink
with every breast you buy.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.175
Here we go, ma'am, free soft drink
with every breast you buy.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.802
Yeah? Give me another one.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.722
Mr. Chicken can't do that,
ma'am, his boss'd squawk.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.349
One coupon per visit.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.227
My feet hurt. You gonna make me leave
the premises and walk back?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.896
Lady, it's one coupon per customer.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.732
-You cheap chicken.
-Loudmouth hen.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.984
Pardon me, what did you say,

24:04.067 --> 24:05.527
-Mr. Gauche Person?
-(alarm bell ringing)

24:05.610 --> 24:08.029
Hey! Robbery!

24:09.322 --> 24:12.576
MICK: Backup requested,
Operation Drumstick, 118 and Utica!

24:13.952 --> 24:17.372
-(people yelling)
-(horns honking)

24:21.418 --> 24:23.920
-Get away! Get away from me, man!
-You're mine, get outta there!

24:24.004 --> 24:26.882
-All's I took is fried chicken!
-Jerk, get outta there, I'm a cop!

24:26.965 --> 24:29.301
-Come on! That, too!
-What?

24:29.384 --> 24:31.970
What? What? What am I looking at here?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.931
-What's this?
-That's my lunch, man.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.061
That's your lunch?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.105
That's not mine,
I didn't know that was in there!

24:42.189 --> 24:43.732
(siren approaching)

24:43.815 --> 24:45.484
There's a lot of heroin in here, dirtbag.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.360
There's at least
a hundred grams of heroin--

24:47.444 --> 24:50.280
How was I supposed to know
that was in there? (cries)

24:50.363 --> 24:52.949
-Mirandize this jerk!
-Okay, spread 'em.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.494
You have the right
to remain silent. If you give up--

24:55.577 --> 24:57.454
(indistinct chatter)

24:57.537 --> 24:59.998
MOE: He came in the back door.
I leave it open 'cause of the heat.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.834
Uh, was he someone known to you?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.045
No, I never saw him before.

25:06.296 --> 25:09.299
-Hey, did you catch him?
-No, I lost him in the subway, I'm sorry.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.427
Great. Take the rest of the day off,
we're shutting down.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.888
Can you tell us how much was taken?

25:16.473 --> 25:19.392
Yeah, he emptied one cash register,
about 200 bucks.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.398
JOE: Uh, can you describe the weapon?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.943
MOE: I didn't see any weapon.
It happened too fast.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.284
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

25:36.368 --> 25:39.204
<i>to the tenth annual new car exposition.</i>

25:39.287 --> 25:42.290
(continues, indistinct)

25:42.374 --> 25:44.918
SALESWOMAN: You won't find a more
powerful engine than this in its class.

25:45.001 --> 25:48.129
Talk about power.
Well, let's take a look under the hood.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.384
That's the high-lift, V8,
fuel-injected and computer regulated

25:52.467 --> 25:54.386
for maximum MPG efficiency

25:54.970 --> 25:56.137
Excuse me, miss,

25:56.638 --> 25:59.975
is this available
with a crushed velour interior?

26:00.058 --> 26:01.935
Yes, we have it in burgundy,

26:02.018 --> 26:05.063
harvest gold, avocado and cornflower blue.

26:05.146 --> 26:08.233
And if I was to make
a down payment of $6,000,

26:08.483 --> 26:10.819
can you tell me what
the payments would be?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.697
Well, I'm sure we can work out
a little mathematics on that

26:13.780 --> 26:15.490
if you'd like to speak
to one of our sales people.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.408
Sure.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.662
Uh, I was just wondering
about the interior

26:20.745 --> 26:23.707
because I was thinking
of redoing my car's upholstery.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.335
Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.046
So what do you think, Lieutenant?

26:30.338 --> 26:31.339
You wanna take her for a spin?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.049
I'm just looking, thanks.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.053
SALESWOMAN: Okay, thanks for stopping by.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.722
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.765
-Howard?
-Ray.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.020
My accountant's office
is here in this building.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.606
I was on my way to take Rosa out to lunch.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.984
Mm. Good-looking car, isn't it?

26:51.067 --> 26:52.485
Yes, very nice.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.824
SALESWOMAN: Stunning
all-leather upholstery

26:57.907 --> 27:00.368
offsets the custom interior.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.371
The eight-cylinder engine is powerful,

27:03.747 --> 27:05.123
yet fuel efficient.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.752
Was a gambler, a womanizer.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.714
He wouldn't come home for weeks at a time.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.302
And when he did, he was abusive.

27:18.845 --> 27:23.558
Verbally, physically, sexually.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.314
I'd already made up my mind to leave him.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.067
Why didn't you tell me?

27:34.110 --> 27:35.362
(sighs) I don't know.

27:38.490 --> 27:42.327
I guess I was afraid it would spoil
what was happening between us.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.580
I was wrong, John.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.542
And as much as I hate the thought of it,

27:51.252 --> 27:53.421
I don't think we ought
to see each other for a while.

27:55.256 --> 27:56.091
Yeah.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.094
Yeah, I guess it's probably a good idea.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.185
John, you are an unexpected
miracle in my life.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.730
You make me feel loved, protected.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.858
But if I'm gonna start new,
I'm gonna have to be honest.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.237
And if what I have done
means losing you, then that--

28:17.320 --> 28:19.698
What? What? Are you kidding?

28:20.824 --> 28:22.826
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.458
Would it be awful to tell you how much
I wish we were in bed together right now?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.128
Holding each other, touching each other--

28:33.211 --> 28:35.296
Hey, come on, you're making me crazy.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.508
I want you now.
I want you a week from now.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.885
I want you a month from now.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.556
Please wait for me. Please.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.392
I'm here.

28:56.025 --> 28:59.988
-She's a citizen.
-Who? Caroline Reynolds?

29:00.238 --> 29:01.573
Nary a parking ticket.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.409
Are you surprised
or are you just disappointed?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.119
I don't like her.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.621
I don't trust her,
I think she's a wrong broad.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.999
I think she may have
even had her husband killed.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.375
There, I said it.

29:12.709 --> 29:16.045
Pats, it's a married woman
having a one-nighter with a cop.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.091
So it's not exactly Mary Poppins,
it's not Lizzy Borden, either.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.473
Captain? I heard about the hooker.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.433
Yeah, Neal's ID'd her.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.894
The MO's the same as the others, right?

29:30.977 --> 29:32.187
That's the preliminary.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.898
Well, you know, Buttman was alone.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.484
He left patrol this morning
for almost an hour.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.402
It could be copycat,
that's what I'm saying.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.403
I can't help thinking it.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.905
All right, we'll question him
when he comes in.

29:44.824 --> 29:48.703
MAN: I was just looking for a few bucks,
man, maybe a couple bags.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.371
MICK: How'd you know
there'd be smack there?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.248
I heard on the street
they were dealing out of there.

29:52.332 --> 29:56.085
I just took the shot.
I swear I didn't know there'd be...

29:56.461 --> 29:59.339
-FRANK: Where are we?
-It's up to him.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.216
Manager doesn't know you
were busted, Harold.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.927
You just contact him,
tell him you made a mistake,

30:04.010 --> 30:05.136
you want to give back what you took.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.014
-Mr. Baker, you don't have to do this.
-You'd be protected, Harold.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.975
You make the exchange,
We'll bust the manager outside.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.560
He won't even know you were involved.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.270
I'm not convinced
they can guarantee your safety.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.147
Your client can work off
charges here, counselor.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.067
Three outstanding B&amp;Es,
now grand larceny possession?

30:19.150 --> 30:21.444
-We can plead that down to a few months.
-We'll drop all charges.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.365
I gotta get back on the street.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.951
I can get you into the county methadone
program in a few days.

30:28.034 --> 30:31.913
I gotta fix today!
Not a few days from now.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.373
You cooperate, you can walk.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.458
I'll do it, I'll do it!

30:39.504 --> 30:42.131
Don't be angry with me. Please?

30:44.050 --> 30:46.761
-It's your decision.
-Work it out. Mick?

30:57.063 --> 30:59.315
(indistinct chatter)

30:59.399 --> 31:01.651
(up-tempo music playing)

31:07.866 --> 31:09.325
Hey, yo, what's happening, Tony?

31:09.409 --> 31:10.535
Need a word with your partner.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.415
You know that, uh...

31:15.790 --> 31:17.250
They just found that hooker
I asked you about.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.960
Somebody caved her skull in for her.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.921
So what you saying,
you think I had something to do with it?

31:22.505 --> 31:23.840
What happened in that back room, Garfield?

31:25.008 --> 31:26.050
Hey, come on, Ron, you can talk to me--

31:26.134 --> 31:27.927
I told you, nothing.
I told everybody, nothing.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.638
-Oh, it's nothing in your book, huh?
-You're not I.A.D.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.849
Will you get it through your head
that I'm trying to help you, man?

31:32.932 --> 31:35.518
What the hell are you doing?
I'm rookie meat and you're standing here--

31:35.602 --> 31:36.728
Look, I gotta live with people.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.772
Oh, we're talking code now,
is that it, Ronnie?

31:40.064 --> 31:42.317
The great cop code of silence,
never rat on your buddies?

31:42.775 --> 31:44.319
You know, you can say
it's not real all you want.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.236
I know it's real.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.822
Okay, who's gonna protect me
if I talk to you?

31:47.906 --> 31:50.366
-If I talk to you, I'm finished.
-Oh, that's crap, man.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.202
You coming forward is the last chance
you got to become a decent cop.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
Listen to me, Ron, you got my word man.

31:55.955 --> 31:56.915
You'll be taken care of.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.085
-So you think Buttman did that girl?
-Did he have reason to?

32:01.169 --> 32:02.045
Look, don't dance me, all right?

32:02.128 --> 32:03.546
-I gotta know.
-I don't know.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.715
But if he did, your silence
is lettin' him get away with it,

32:05.798 --> 32:07.091
and that's a felony, Jack.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.552
You know, I think I'm losing it.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.429
Hey, look, man,
if you can't tell the truth,

32:11.512 --> 32:12.639
if Buttman or whoever else

32:12.722 --> 32:15.433
has you so tied up
that you don't see the harm to justice,

32:15.516 --> 32:16.893
then the hell with you, brother.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.067
JOE: Mick, there's a black car pulling up.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.028
Two of 'em.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.489
The driver fits the description.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.659
<i>The other guy's a monster.</i>
<i>They're just entering the building.</i>

32:33.076 --> 32:34.410
Copy. Follow 'em up.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.120
Okay, we're on our way.

32:46.089 --> 32:50.385
-Hey, wh--
-Harold, just do like I said, all right?

32:51.386 --> 32:53.179
If there's any trouble,
I'm gonna back you up.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.390
HAROLD: Okay. I'm all right.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.142
-You all right?
-All right.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.937
-Yeah.
-(knocking on door)

33:01.020 --> 33:02.188
MANAGER: Harold Baker.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.233
Just a second. Yeah.

33:07.568 --> 33:08.403
Just a sec.

33:10.279 --> 33:11.614
-Let's have it.
-Right there.

33:11.698 --> 33:12.991
-Count it.
-Hey, cool, it's all there,

33:13.074 --> 33:14.659
the money, too, just like I promised.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.661
So you're a champ,
is that what you want to hear?

33:16.744 --> 33:18.955
-What are you doing?
-Expect me to thank you, chump?

33:19.414 --> 33:20.540
Police! Freeze!

33:21.040 --> 33:23.167
-All right. Don't move.
-PATSY: Freeze!

33:23.251 --> 33:25.712
-JOE: Don't move.
-PATSY: Right there. Hands up!

33:26.045 --> 33:27.213
-Drop the gun!
-(whimpering)

33:27.296 --> 33:28.589
-I'll kill him.
-Let him go.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.299
-Drop it.
-Don't be stupid.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.176
-Great! This is great!
-Drop it!

33:34.846 --> 33:36.723
-You're dead, punk! You're buried!
-Shut up!

33:39.350 --> 33:41.769
-I'm gonna find you!
-Move it, get him outta here.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.814
-Move it, move it. Get down.
-What about him, Mick?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.357
He's got immunity.

33:48.735 --> 33:49.861
You're on your own, kid.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.071
We need you for trial, we'll call you.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.164
Here it is, right here.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.332
-Natalie?
-PATSY: We got a couple.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.670
Read that to me again, huh?
Oh, here it is, right here.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.547
Detective, we got a cop here.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.590
Hold on a second, man.

34:12.508 --> 34:13.509
Can we talk somewhere?

34:14.385 --> 34:16.012
Yeah, I'll call you back, Mack, half hour.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.389
Right this way, chief.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.517
RON: And--and so, uh--

34:22.393 --> 34:25.438
Buttman wanted 20 apiece for the girl.

34:25.813 --> 34:30.151
And-and, uh... I don't know
who paid, but--

34:31.235 --> 34:32.070
but I did.

34:34.697 --> 34:39.786
See-see, um... Buttman said
that Swanny was a virgin.

34:39.869 --> 34:44.082
And, um... how it wasn't
right for a cop to be a virgin.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.961
So, by then Swann could hardly talk.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.590
You know, stammering and-and trying to say

34:52.673 --> 34:54.634
how-how he wasn't.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.428
(exhales, shaking) Um...

34:57.845 --> 35:00.765
So Buttman said
we're all gonna help him out.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.811
By which he meant tie him to a chair

35:04.894 --> 35:07.230
and take his... take his pants down.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.232
See, that was Buttman's idea.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.734
But we all did that.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.363
You know, everybody saying
how we'd like to have help

35:15.988 --> 35:17.448
like Swanny was.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.744
But Swann didn't think it was a joke.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.331
You know, he was, uh--

35:26.207 --> 35:28.000
He started crying, and-and--

35:28.084 --> 35:30.795
Uh, and then she came in.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.172
Um, Lois.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.550
And she, uh...

35:37.343 --> 35:38.511
and--and she...

35:40.388 --> 35:42.098
performed a sexual act on him.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.017
(sighs) I'm so sorry.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.979
You know, we meant it like a joke.

35:48.896 --> 35:52.108
I swear to God, Swann, we did.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.820
(sniffles)

36:08.499 --> 36:10.209
-(Buttman giggling)
-Randall Buttman?

36:10.501 --> 36:12.336
You're under arrest, for pandering,

36:12.420 --> 36:14.630
conspiracy to assault and rape.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.966
Turn over your shield and your firearm.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.968
Don't make it hard on yourself, Buttman.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.138
You'll make bail.
You'll get a P.B.A. lawyer.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.390
-Joe?
-Yeah, with pleasure.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.018
-Hey, Joe...
-Come on.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.189
Don't smell rat meat, do I, Garfield?

36:31.480 --> 36:34.692
I don't smell lame,
nigga-boy rat meat, do I Garfield?

36:35.776 --> 36:36.777
(Buttman yells)

36:43.910 --> 36:45.161
Tough spot for that kid.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.996
Took a lot of guts to speak up.

36:47.079 --> 36:47.997
Would have been better last night.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.207
What about the other rookies?

36:49.290 --> 36:51.500
I'll talk to Daniels.
The rest of it's for I.A.D.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.419
Howard? My office.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.963
Ray, Henry?

37:09.810 --> 37:11.520
Gentleman, uh... (sighs)

37:12.271 --> 37:14.148
I would have preferred to go
with my original proposal,

37:14.232 --> 37:15.942
but failing that,

37:16.901 --> 37:19.779
I've had to resort to rather a more
subjective criteria.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.907
So, based solely on financial need,

37:22.990 --> 37:24.951
I've decided the survey job
should go to Ray.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.496
Need for what, Frank?

37:29.956 --> 37:33.000
A luxury sedan,
with a crushed velour interior?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.335
That is a low blow, Howard.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.045
Did he tell you what
he needed the money for?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.423
-FRANK: Ray?
-Frank, may I have a word with you alone?

37:39.507 --> 37:44.095
He's gonna plunk it down on a four-door
cornflower-blue touring car.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.972
-That's what he "needs" it for.
-Frank for the record,

37:46.055 --> 37:47.765
I ran into both of them coming
out of the auto show--

37:47.848 --> 37:50.268
And I suppose you wanted a test drive
to see if you liked the radio.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.812
I did not misrepresent
my desire for the money.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.522
Just a second, what were you doing there?

37:55.314 --> 37:56.357
Maybe I had a dentist appointment.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.734
-There are no dentists in that building.
-His office is across the street.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.152
There some law against window shopping?

38:00.236 --> 38:03.239
-Apparently, you think so.
-Ray, what about Rosa's cousin?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.951
All my life,
I have fulfilled every obligation.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.161
To my family, professionally,

38:09.537 --> 38:11.872
and just once
I wanted something for myself.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.041
-Will you condemn me for that?
-Yes.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.960
-All his pretenses--
-Go ahead, cast the first stone!

38:16.043 --> 38:17.336
Both of you, cut it out!

38:18.170 --> 38:20.923
I'm giving back the grant.
I'm just gonna send it, I'm giving it up.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.594
-HENRY: Frank--
-End of conference,

38:25.678 --> 38:26.804
end of discussion, Henry.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.764
-Thank you very much.
-Frank...

38:28.848 --> 38:29.682
No, Howard.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.272
I regretfully accept the consequences
of my actions,

38:36.856 --> 38:39.775
But in truth, I do not apologize.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.237
Howard.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.744
-Ms. Davenport.
-Lieutenant.

38:55.041 --> 38:55.958
That bad?

38:58.461 --> 39:00.379
Nothing a romantic dinner couldn't cure.

39:00.921 --> 39:01.839
Want some company?

39:02.256 --> 39:03.174
(knocking on door)

39:03.632 --> 39:06.052
Excuse me, Captain. Ms. Davenport.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.597
Harold Baker's dead. OD'd.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.767
Transit cops found him in a bathroom
at the bus station.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.685
He had two of those balloons.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.979
I guess he lifted 'em and I didn't see it.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.065
It's pretty pure stuff.

39:19.148 --> 39:19.982
Okay, Mick.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.243
Joyce?

39:31.327 --> 39:32.995
(clicks tongue) He was my client, Frank.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.581
I can't help feeling he was coerced.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.249
He knew the options,
he wanted to be back on the street.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.459
That was no option.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.795
You put a kid in a candy store.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.421
It wasn't the operation that killed him,

39:42.505 --> 39:44.256
it was the purity of the stuff he took.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.134
If we hadn't caught him,
he'd be just as dead by now.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.054
For the record, I think it stinks.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.806
Get no argument from me.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.060
I want to leave this one in the office.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.772
No argument from me, either.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.649
Can we go home now?

40:07.488 --> 40:08.823
-WAITER: Ma'am?
-Thank you.

40:09.156 --> 40:10.199
-Thank you.
-Here you are, sir.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.663
I'd like to get something
out on the table.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.248
-Up front.
-Shoot.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.501
Are we here so you can talk
me out of the story?

40:21.252 --> 40:22.211
No, not at all.

40:23.295 --> 40:26.298
Because if you are, I have to tell you
you're wasting your time.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.636
You're just gonna
have to trust me when I say

40:30.719 --> 40:32.721
that we're here
because I wanted to take you to dinner.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.974
Your partner didn't put you up to this?

40:36.392 --> 40:39.603
Ms. Williams,
question my motives every which way.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.063
They're gonna stand up.

40:41.605 --> 40:45.359
At the very least, you ought to see
we're capable of better table manners.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.113
-Officer Hill...
-Bobby.

40:50.030 --> 40:50.865
Bobby.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.119
The entire time we followed you,
you never answered a single call.

40:55.744 --> 40:59.582
And to be honest, your partner
showed more interest in stuffing his face

40:59.665 --> 41:01.041
than taking care of business.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.252
Sometimes that's the way
a day goes, you know.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.670
We answer the calls we get.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.966
I've never seen anyone
eat so many donuts in my life.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.802
With a new wife, new baby,

41:11.886 --> 41:13.762
Renko's under a lot of pressure right now.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.348
He doesn't drink much,
he doesn't do drugs.

41:16.432 --> 41:19.351
-He does donuts.
-Something like that.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.563
Even so, he's kind
of a blowhard, isn't he?

41:23.647 --> 41:24.607
Sometimes.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.485
But what he is mostly,
Lynn, is a good cop.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.196
He's got two commendations for bravery,

41:30.279 --> 41:31.405
and he's probably the best friend

41:31.489 --> 41:32.990
-I have in the world.
-(soft click)

41:44.627 --> 41:45.503
Nice.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.922
Okay, so I figured...

41:48.506 --> 41:50.299
maybe some kind of bribe
or something was coming

41:50.382 --> 41:52.176
and I, you know, brought it.

41:52.468 --> 41:55.554
And I feel incredibly stupid.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.018
Here. Take it.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.565
I'm... really sorry.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.277
(sighs) Boy, do I feel dumb.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.533
You ready to order yet?

42:17.701 --> 42:18.536
You're not mad?

42:19.286 --> 42:21.622
-Do I look mad?
-A little.

42:24.959 --> 42:25.793
A little.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.046
If you give me the chance,
I'm the forgiving type.

42:31.966 --> 42:32.800
(chuckles)

42:37.555 --> 42:38.681
-John?
-Yeah.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.269
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called,
but he terrified me.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.853
It's okay, you did the right thing.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.522
I didn't know whether
to call the police or what?

42:46.605 --> 42:47.439
Hey, what am I?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.109
He must have called half a dozen times.

42:50.192 --> 42:52.236
He doesn't speak,
I just hear him breathing.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.154
Look, if you want,
we'll put a trace on the line.

42:54.488 --> 42:55.990
Do you really think that's necessary?

42:56.657 --> 42:59.451
The truth is, these creeps,
they read something in the paper.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.537
They're like vultures, scary but harmless.

43:02.454 --> 43:04.164
You want me to stay
in case he calls again?

43:04.415 --> 43:06.208
Please, for a while at least.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.793
My pleasure, ma'am.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.222
LUCY: I saw Swann's aunt today.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.725
How's she doing?

43:25.144 --> 43:26.020
Pretty bad.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.272
Got four kids. Of her own.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.858
I don't know,
something like this really...

43:30.941 --> 43:33.569
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey, Neal.

43:33.652 --> 43:34.903
I told the man from Polk Avenue

43:34.987 --> 43:37.114
he ought to get
in with some real cops. Ron Garfield.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.617
-Lucy Bates, how you doin'?
-Pleasure.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.869
-Joe Coffey, how you doing?
-Good. It's good to meet you, Joe.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.120
You're the one with Buttman, right?

43:43.912 --> 43:46.248
Don't worry about it, you got three votes
on your side right here.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.626
-Mm-hm.
-Let me ask you something.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.461
You think Buttman croaked that hooker?

43:52.379 --> 43:53.213
I don't know.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.634
His alibi's still holding.
Somebody saw him in the bank.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.302
Come on, take a load off. Sit down.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.971
Right, look, let me grab a beer,
everybody covered?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.139
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm cool.

44:03.932 --> 44:05.476
(chuckling) Excuse me.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.191
Hey, lips.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.488
I don't want this, Buttman.

44:17.571 --> 44:18.947
You know what they used to say
in the war, don't you?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.033
Big lips sink ships.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.035
RON: Wasn't big lips, Buttman,
I think it was loose lips.

44:23.118 --> 44:25.329
Yeah, well, big lips,
loose lips, it's all the same to me.

44:25.412 --> 44:28.874
-Hey, move it along, Buttman.
-Big lips, big mouth.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.460
-You know, it all makes a lot of sense.
-Randy, why don't you get out of here.

44:32.836 --> 44:36.131
You know, Joe.
The broads with suntans I can understand.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.676
But you, I thought you had some class.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.803
Hey. You know what I like
about you, Randy?

44:40.886 --> 44:42.763
Compared to you, we all look terrific.

44:42.846 --> 44:44.890
-We all look clean.
-You look like a jerk, pal.

44:44.973 --> 44:45.891
-Hey.
-Hey!

44:47.559 --> 44:48.602
Hey, hey, hey!

44:49.269 --> 44:50.646
(yelling, indistinct)

44:52.272 --> 44:53.941
All right, easy, easy, easy.

44:55.609 --> 44:56.777
You wanna talk lips now, Buttman?

44:56.860 --> 44:59.405
You wanna talk fat lips?
You wanna talk mouths?

44:59.488 --> 45:01.949
-I'll be talkin' to you.
-Oh, get out of here!

45:02.324 --> 45:04.743
Get out of here! Yeah, sucker!

45:09.331 --> 45:12.167
Hey, kid, you all right? Huh?

45:13.127 --> 45:14.461
You know, you got me into this, man.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.255
What am I gonna do now?

45:16.338 --> 45:18.132
You can look at yourself
in the mirror and feel proud,

45:18.215 --> 45:19.508
that's what you can do, buddy.

45:25.013 --> 45:26.140
(glass breaking)

45:28.183 --> 45:29.393
-(whispers) John?
-Hm?

45:29.935 --> 45:32.229
John, wake up.
There's somebody downstairs.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.772
-What?
-I heard a window break.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.149
-Where?
-Downstairs.

45:36.775 --> 45:39.737
-Don't go down there.
-Call the police.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.780
Tell 'em it's a Code Six.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.908
-And lock this door behind me.
-Please be careful.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.327
Hey, I'm a cop, remember?

46:18.525 --> 46:19.735
Hold it right there! Police!

46:20.569 --> 46:21.403
(grunts)

46:34.291 --> 46:36.460
(siren approaching)

46:44.301 --> 46:45.511
(both laughing)

46:45.594 --> 46:48.639
So I finally said, oh, the hell with it.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.265
I mean, if it's gonna give us
this kind of grief,

46:50.349 --> 46:52.059
I'm just gonna refuse the damn thing.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.271
-What about the $6,000?
-Gone. Goodbye.

46:57.397 --> 46:59.441
How much work did that involve, Furillo?

47:01.735 --> 47:03.654
Shuffling papers, couple hours a week.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.156
So?

47:07.908 --> 47:09.952
(sighs) Six thousand?

47:16.708 --> 47:18.627
-Which I could do on weekends.
-Mm-hm.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.630
I'm thinking about houses.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.340
Down payments.

47:25.217 --> 47:26.218
Sold, counselor.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.263
Bold executive decision.

47:31.557 --> 47:34.059
(phone ringing)

47:36.061 --> 47:36.895
Furillo.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.107
Yeah, J.D.?

47:43.485 --> 47:44.736
(shushes)

47:46.363 --> 47:47.197
Where are you?

47:49.992 --> 47:50.826
I'll be right there.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.455
LaRue just killed somebody.

48:03.005 --> 48:06.008
(closing theme playing)
