00:08.508 --> 00:10.844
-[JJ] Anything broken?
-[Kie] Didn't feel good?

00:11.594 --> 00:14.305
-[John B] You okay?
-[JJ] You did not tuck and roll, for sure.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.348
[creaking]

00:15.432 --> 00:17.851
[all speaking indistinctly]

00:17.934 --> 00:19.436
[suspenseful music playing]

00:19.519 --> 00:21.646
[all scream]

00:23.982 --> 00:25.608
[both panting]

00:26.651 --> 00:28.695
-Pope, are you okay?
-Hey, you good?

00:28.778 --> 00:32.282
Yeah, I'm good. Just give me, like,
one second to, like, catch my breath.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.242
[John B] You did it, Pope.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.329
Ah.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.791
Pope, she's… she's beautiful.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.419
-[Sarah] I've never seen anything like it.
-[JJ] Detail's insane.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.755
[John B] Well, here's why Limbrey wanted
that key so bad.

00:46.838 --> 00:50.175
[JJ] Whoa. Good find.
How much do you think she's worth?

00:50.258 --> 00:54.679
Like, if we melted her old bones down,
dude, I'm talking like high billions.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.182
This belongs in a--
No! This belongs in a museum.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.933
[JJ] What? So no one sees her?

00:59.017 --> 01:01.102
-In a museum where everyone sees it.
-Are you kidding?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.937
Hey! It's my ancestors' cross!

01:03.021 --> 01:05.231
Right, okay. All right, all right. Well…

01:05.315 --> 01:07.942
This is bigger than money,
and the world's gotta know the truth.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.570
Yes. If we don't get this shit outta here
before Limbrey gets here,

01:10.653 --> 01:12.697
nobody's gonna know. So saddle up.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.699
-[JJ] It's heavy like right here.
-Ah! God!

01:14.783 --> 01:17.410
Wait. Hold on. John B,
you're gonna pull, all right? Pull down.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.288
I'm gonna pull down. You guys pull up.
Ready? One, two, three.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.998
-JJ, watch your foot.
-[Sarah] Oh my God!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.209
-[all grunting, groaning]
-Shit! Okay!

01:26.252 --> 01:27.504
Okay. I got it.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.881
Okay.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.634
Who's… who's not lifting right now?
Sarah, are you seriously--

01:32.717 --> 01:34.094
-[Sarah] I'm lifting!
-Move forward.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.887
-[JJ] It doesn't feel like it!
-[Sarah] I am!

01:35.970 --> 01:39.891
-[grunts] Okay, guys. I can't. I can't.
-[Kie] No! No, no, no!

01:39.974 --> 01:43.728
No, no, Pope! Hang on there!
No, no, no, no, no, no! No!

01:43.812 --> 01:45.438
-[metal clanks]
-[all panting]

01:45.522 --> 01:49.025
Damn it, yo!
You almost dropped it on my foot!

01:49.109 --> 01:51.277
-'Cause I'm the only one lifting it!
-[JJ] Oh, you sure--

01:51.361 --> 01:54.405
Okay, okay, okay, okay! Listen,
we'll make like a sling, like a little--

01:54.489 --> 01:56.407
Yeah, yeah,
and then put it on the tail hitch.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.662
Guys! Guys, guys,
I'm not okay. I'm not okay.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.704
-[groans]
-[John B] Shit!

02:01.788 --> 02:05.166
-[Sarah] Your eye, it looks all puffy.
-You good? You don't look too good, bro.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.417
I can't-- [gasps]

02:06.501 --> 02:08.002
He's having an allergic reaction.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.380
-[Sarah] How many times did you get stung?
-[JJ] Hey! Hey!

02:10.463 --> 02:12.924
-[Kie] What about the cross?
-[John B] JJ, try and hide it.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.802
-I got it. I got the cross.
-[John B] Here we go. Come on. Come on.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.304
-[wheezing]
-[Kie] We'll come back!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.848
-I can't breathe.
-I know.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.809
-[JJ] I don't know how I'll hide this!
-[John B] Can you get the door?

02:22.892 --> 02:24.144
[Pope] I can't breathe.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.272
-[Kie] JJ! We gotta go!
-[JJ] It's so heavy. I can't-- I'm coming!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.732
Jeez! That thing's heavy.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.527
-Sarah, I didn't hide it well enough.
-[Sarah] Don't worry about that.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.071
-We gotta get Pope some help.
-Pope, what do you need, buddy?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.365
-[Sarah] Keep his legs elevated.
-[JJ] What do you need?

02:37.448 --> 02:38.491
-A shot!
-[JJ] A shot? Okay.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.076
I know where to go! Give me the keys!

02:40.160 --> 02:43.329
-[Kie] They're in the ignition! Go.
-[JJ] Right. I knew that.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.498
-[Sarah] Keep a hand on his pulse.
-[Kie] We got you.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.834
-[JJ] Hang on, Pope! We're going.
-[Kie] Pope?

02:50.545 --> 02:51.504
Let's go.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.466
[whistles]

03:00.221 --> 03:02.182
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

03:05.059 --> 03:08.104
[announcer on TV] It's time
to play Family Feud!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.022
[horn honking]

03:09.105 --> 03:12.400
Give it up for Steve Harvey!

03:12.483 --> 03:13.484
Ricky!

03:13.985 --> 03:16.738
-[Kie] Are you good?
-[JJ] Ricky! Hey! Bro!

03:16.821 --> 03:20.200
-Ricky! Ricky! Hey, Ricky!
-[Ricky] Not today.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.660
Ricky, hey, I got a problem, bro!
I know you're mad at me!

03:22.744 --> 03:24.454
Remember that time you stole my ambulance?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.372
Yeah. I know. I know.
I know you're mad. No!

03:26.456 --> 03:29.083
-Don't do that!
-[Sarah] No! Please! Please, we need help!

03:29.167 --> 03:32.128
He got stung by a wasp!
He's having a reaction! Please help!

03:32.212 --> 03:33.922
-Hey! Yeah, he--
-[Sarah] Please help!

03:34.005 --> 03:36.132
-[JJ] He can't breathe, Ricky!
-[John B] Ricky!

03:36.216 --> 03:39.010
-[Sarah] He's right here, please!
-Who can't breathe?

03:39.093 --> 03:42.180
-Look at him! Help my friend!
-[wheezing]

03:44.432 --> 03:45.975
-Help!
-[Ricky] All right, Jesus Christ.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.727
Hey! Nice to meet you. Sorry.

03:47.810 --> 03:48.811
[John B] Yeah.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.606
[JJ] You know, I wouldn't come to you
if it wasn't an emergency.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.441
Hang in there, buddy.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.318
-[Ricky] What's wrong with him?
-Wasps!

03:55.401 --> 03:56.444
-Wasps?
-[Sarah] Yes!

03:56.527 --> 03:58.821
-Is he allergic to wasps?
-[Kie] Clearly.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.657
-Okay.
-[John B] A beehive worth of wasps.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.617
-[JJ] Raise his legs!
-[Ricky] What's his name?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.786
-[Sarah] Pope.
-[Ricky] Hey, Pope?

04:04.869 --> 04:06.829
Hang tight. I gotta get my kit.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.749
-[JJ] Hang tight? Ricky!
-He's looking for a kit. Go help.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.833
-Kit?
-Yeah. Go help.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.461
[Kie] Breathe a little, okay?
Like a little bit.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.464
-Where's the kit, Ricky?
-If I knew, I wouldn't be looking!

04:16.547 --> 04:18.091
Goddamn it! Well, then find it, bro!

04:18.174 --> 04:20.593
I need you to focus.
Focus on your breathing, okay?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.637
-[JJ] What does it look like?
-Like a duffel bag!

04:22.720 --> 04:24.555
-A duffel bag!
-Where's your kit?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.432
[John B] Out in the garage, maybe.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.434
[wheezing]

04:28.518 --> 04:30.520
-[Kie] Focus on your breathing.
-Okay, I got it!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.272
-I got it! I got it.
-[John B] Yeah, yeah.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.065
-All right.
-[Kie] Okay.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.233
[JJ] What do we do now?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.986
[Ricky] You don't do anything
'cause you're not a paramedic.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.155
Okay. Hey, Pope. How you doing, man?
You look like shit.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.450
Here's the thing.
This is a pediatric dose of epinephrine.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.703
-Is that gonna be enough?
-He's not a kid!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.413
It is ten times a normal dose.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.957
So if… if it doesn't stop his heart,
it'll help him.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.167
But I gotta use the whole thing,
or it won't work.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.670
-And I'm not going down if he dies.
-Okay! Fine! Do it! Hit it!

04:55.753 --> 04:57.046
-Come on, hurry up!
-Okay.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.339
[JJ] Come on, hurry up!

04:58.965 --> 05:00.300
Pope, hang in there, buddy.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.635
[wheezing, groans]

05:02.719 --> 05:04.637
[JJ groans] I hate needles, man.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.393
Okay, um, that's it.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.563
-Now what?
-Now we wait.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.441
[Steve Harvey speaking indistinctly on TV]

05:16.524 --> 05:20.862
All right. Well, let's go. We asked
100 married people, name something

05:20.945 --> 05:23.656
your wife thinks she does really well,
but she doesn't.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.575
-[woman] Clean.
-[Steve] Clean.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.160
-You killed him.
-[Ricky] No.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.703
-Yes, you did!
-I didn't do shit.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.496
What did you do?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.957
I did exactly what you asked me to do.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.835
Please! Please! Pope, please, come on!

05:36.669 --> 05:38.046
[JJ] Pope, come on, bro!

05:39.839 --> 05:41.632
[gasping, breathing]

05:41.716 --> 05:43.634
-Wait, wait, wait, he--
-Pope? Pope, Pope, Pope?

05:43.718 --> 05:45.345
[coughing]

05:45.428 --> 05:46.721
[laughing]

05:47.555 --> 05:49.140
-[Kie] Pope!
-[panting]

05:49.223 --> 05:51.351
[JJ] There he is.
That's my boy right there!

05:51.434 --> 05:54.562
-[Pope] It's hot! I'm real hot, guys.
-It's okay. Take it easy.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.397
-I gotta get outside.
-[John B] Simmer down.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.357
[JJ] I owe you.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.233
-[Kie] Take a second!
-I need to get outside.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.610
-It's hot!
-[John B] You're good!

06:00.693 --> 06:01.527
Thank you so much.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.905
Are there any side effects
we should be concerned about?

06:03.988 --> 06:06.366
[Ricky] He'll have a rocket up his ass
for about half an hour,

06:06.449 --> 06:07.533
then he'll be fine.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.411
-[Pope] Let's go get that cross! Whoo!
-[John B] Whoa!

06:10.495 --> 06:12.914
-[Pope] Game six! I'm Michael Jordan!
-[John B] Yeah, game six!

06:12.997 --> 06:15.750
["Boys in the Better Land"
by Fontaines D.C. playing]

06:15.833 --> 06:18.294
[Sarah] Uh, Pope,
you're driving pretty fast.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.212
[howls]

06:19.295 --> 06:22.215
Pope, last to judge, but I think
you should slow down a little.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.259
That would definitely delay our arrival
to the cross. We gotta get there.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.552
Why did we let him drive again?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.097
-I said I'd rip your ears off.
-He said he'd rip our ears off.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.265
-[Kie] You did.
-I was joking about that, by the way.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.892
That's a really funny joke.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.894
Hey, how ya feeling, buddy?
How ya doing?

06:34.977 --> 06:38.815
Uh, fantastic. I don't know
what JJ's cousin gave me, but I am moving!

06:38.898 --> 06:39.732
We couldn't tell.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.610
Okay, well, um,
you're going really fast right now.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.861
Yeah, really fast!

06:43.945 --> 06:46.114
[all shouting]

06:46.197 --> 06:48.574
I don't know if you noticed,
but there's these giant oak trees

06:48.658 --> 06:50.993
all along the road.
They're like six inches off the road.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.787
-[JJ] Whoa, whoa!
-You don't need to pass.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.665
You don't need to pass.
You don't need to pass. [shouts]

-[all screaming]
-[tires screeching]

06:58.292 --> 07:00.670
-What an asshole, right?
-He's going the speed limit!

07:00.753 --> 07:02.880
We're not gonna get to the cross
if we're dead, Pope!

07:02.964 --> 07:05.425
We're not gonna die.
It's our divine right to get that cross.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.927
-Pope! Look at the road!
-[all screaming]

-[John B] Is everyone okay?
-[Sarah weakly] I think so.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.611
[JJ] Never better.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.740
[groans]
That is the last time you drive, Pope.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.621
My dad's truck! No!

07:35.705 --> 07:38.708
Kie, one word. Totaled.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.293
My parents are gonna kill me

07:41.294 --> 07:42.503
for real this time.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.298
Yeah, well,
weren't they already gonna do that anyway?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.966
-Okay.
-Helpful. Thank you.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.801
We're gonna have to walk
the rest of the way.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.720
-Dude.
-I'm going to get my cross.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.763
Hey, just relax for a second.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.765
-Get off of me.
-[John B] No. I'm trying to help.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.226
-I'm getting my cross.
-We just crashed the car.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.146
-I'm trying to watch out for you. Hey! No!
-[Kie] Pope! Pope!

08:00.229 --> 08:02.315
-There's a truck coming.
-Get off of me!

08:02.398 --> 08:04.358
[John B] You're gonna get hit by a car!

08:05.067 --> 08:08.404
-[echoing] What are you doing?
-[menacing electronic music playing]

08:08.488 --> 08:09.489
Pope, no!

08:11.032 --> 08:12.033
Stop!

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380
-[Pope] We gotta get back to the church!
-Pope!

08:26.464 --> 08:28.341
-[Pope] No, no!
-[Kie] No, no, no, no!

08:30.384 --> 08:32.970
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

08:44.190 --> 08:45.149

08:46.150 --> 08:48.861
[JJ grunts] Damn it!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.781
I knew I didn't hide it well enough!

08:52.448 --> 08:53.574
Damn it!

08:53.658 --> 08:57.036
[grunts] Okay. What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.497
Okay, think, think, think, think.

09:01.749 --> 09:06.254
We need a plan. We need a plan.
What's the plan? [panting]

09:08.923 --> 09:10.383
All right, here's what we do.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.802
We'll grab some kerosene tanks
from the Chat,

09:12.885 --> 09:15.513
then we… we go to my dad's shop
and grab some dynamite.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.267
And then we drive down to Charleston
and tell this lady who she's messing with!

09:19.350 --> 09:21.269
Because this is some bullshit, y'all!

09:21.352 --> 09:23.604
-That's not gonna help.
-[JJ] Well, what is, Sarah?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.106
I'm thinking, okay?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.234
We can't just go blow shit up, JJ.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.069
Pope, I'm sorry.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.906
Denmark would've stood right here…

09:33.990 --> 09:36.158
[sentimental instrumental music playing]

09:36.242 --> 09:39.412
…preaching to everyone he set free.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.667
A slave,
the sole survivor of the Royal Merchant,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.503
he got the gold and the cross,
and he brought them both to shore

09:47.587 --> 09:50.756
and used it to free every person
who walked through those doors.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.178
He made a church,
a family, a congregation…

09:58.681 --> 09:59.640
a home.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.144
And the Limbreys took everything from him.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.272
They sicced dogs on his wife and his kids,

10:06.355 --> 10:08.357
and when he tried to get her remains,
they hung him.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.654
Well, I'm done. I'm tired of that shit.
That is not how this is gonna end.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.575
We need a freaking win, guys.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.578
I'm going to get my family's cross.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.170
You guys coming?

10:29.795 --> 10:32.840
-Well, if you put it that way…
-Maybe we should think about it, you know?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.717
-Pros and cons?
-[JJ] Pros and cons list.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.552
[JJ] Hell yeah, we're coming, Pope!

10:37.470 --> 10:38.971
[ship horn blaring]

10:39.055 --> 10:41.182
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

10:45.353 --> 10:49.065
-We good to go?
-Everything you wanted. With four berths.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.317
-What about the security?
-[man] All arranged.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.905
But we leave in 12 hours.
And it's not an Uber. It's not gonna wait.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.290
I don't wanna be on the passenger list.
Understand?

11:06.374 --> 11:07.541
Yes, ma'am.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.794
Sure do.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.400
[Renfield groaning]

11:35.194 --> 11:37.446
[Renfield and Rafe grunting]

11:37.530 --> 11:38.948
-[Rafe] Hold up.
-[Renfield] Careful.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.160
-[grunts] Ready?
-[Rafe] On three. One, two, three.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.996
-[Renfield] Hold up.
-Yeah.

11:46.997 --> 11:47.873
Okay.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.001
I don't believe it.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.587
[panting]
I told you I'd get it for you, didn't I?

11:55.423 --> 11:58.884
You said you would, and… and you did.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.014
Before we do this,
I just wanna remind you of the deal, okay?

12:04.682 --> 12:06.892
You really are your father's son,
aren't you?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.228
Talking about deals at a moment like this.

12:09.311 --> 12:13.023
-I showed you the mural. I get my cut.
-The deal is as we discussed, Rafe.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.234
-[Rafe] It better be.
-You'll get your cut.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.491
[emotional instrumental music playing]

12:33.919 --> 12:35.254
[Limbrey] So beautiful.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.759
Inside this cross is the shroud.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.930
And whoever touches
the hem of the garment… [sniffles]

12:46.474 --> 12:47.725
…shall be healed.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.113
It's time for a miracle. [chuckles]

13:01.197 --> 13:03.240
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

13:08.496 --> 13:11.499
-Here. Let me help you get it.
-No! It's meant for a Limbrey.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.963
-[lock clicks]
-[Limbrey gasps]

13:32.353 --> 13:33.479
[Rafe] Hmm.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.273
The magic scarf was eaten by bugs.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.235
[Renfield laughing]

13:40.027 --> 13:40.903
[coughs]

13:40.986 --> 13:43.739
[continues laughing]

13:44.990 --> 13:47.910
[grunts] How dare you mock me!

13:49.578 --> 13:51.288
-[Limbrey grunts]
-[Rafe] Hey, hey, hey!

13:52.498 --> 13:53.541
Easy, Carla.

13:53.624 --> 13:58.212
That's it. You're cut off.
You're not getting a penny.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.756
I don't need your money.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.383
I've got the cross now.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.886
-Come on, Rafe. Help me.
-[Limbrey] Rafe!

14:05.970 --> 14:07.972
[Renfield] Don't worry.
You'll still get your cut.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.766
-Come on.
-[panting] Renfield!

14:10.850 --> 14:13.894
-[Renfield] Hold on. One second. [grunts]
-Renfield!

14:14.687 --> 14:16.397
-[Rafe grunts]
-[Renfield] Careful!

14:18.691 --> 14:22.403
-Push it, man.
-Renfield, get over here. Help me up.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.029
[Renfield] Help you up?

14:24.113 --> 14:27.700
You're lucky I don't back up over you.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.285
[laughing]

14:31.036 --> 14:32.705
-[gun fires]
-[groans]

14:35.791 --> 14:37.793
[Renfield and Rafe panting]

14:42.298 --> 14:44.842
[Renfield gasping]

14:52.725 --> 14:54.393
-[Limbrey] Rafe.
-Oh, shit.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.979
Don't just stand there
with your mouth open. Help me up.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.231
Rafe.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.066
[sternly] Rafe!

15:01.150 --> 15:05.070
He wasn't a good man.
Rafe, he's not one of us. Come on.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.421
No.
What are you doing? What are you doing?

15:22.504 --> 15:24.340
Rafe! Rafe!

15:24.423 --> 15:25.507
Rafe!

15:26.216 --> 15:27.843
No! No.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.554
Rafe, help me. Rafe.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.555
Rafe!

15:33.015 --> 15:34.016
[door closes]

15:34.099 --> 15:36.810
Rafe! You better shoot me,
because I swear to God,

15:36.894 --> 15:40.439
there will not be a place
that you can hide from me! Get back here!

15:46.278 --> 15:47.947
[sirens blaring]

15:48.030 --> 15:51.575
-[Kie] Oh shit! They found the truck.
-[Pope] Chill, chill, chill, chill.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.994
-[JJ] Of course.
-All right, just relax. Just relax.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.245
[Shoupe] Well, lookee here.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.581
Good evening, Officer.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.250
-Sheriff. Yeah.
-Sheriff. Yeah, that's right.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.878
-[indistinct chattering on police radio]
-Speed kills, huh?

16:02.962 --> 16:06.340
I pulled the tags,
and I know whose truck that is.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.470
Hey! Kie, you drop
your weed pen back there?

16:12.304 --> 16:13.472
-Found it.
-[Shoupe] Oh.

16:13.555 --> 16:17.017
Sheriff, I just wanna say
that this is all my fault.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.938
She had nothing to do with this.
I take 100% responsibility.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.898
Nothing to do with it? Uh-huh.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.233
You wanna try that again?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.319
Your parents reported the truck missing
four hours ago,

16:27.403 --> 16:30.239
and the keys were missing from the house.
I'm taking you home.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.283
Or I can pull you all in
for leaving the scene of an accident.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.618
Okay.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.370
Good. Plumb.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.045
-[somber instrumental music playing]
-[Kie softly] Yeah.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.840
I gotta deal.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.217
Hit me up later
and make sure I'm still alive.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.180
[Shoupe] Come on. Let's get you home.

16:57.391 --> 17:01.395
Hey, Rose, I got the… the cross of, um…

17:01.478 --> 17:04.314
The cross thing
that they were looking for, I got it!

17:04.815 --> 17:08.652
Our ballroom days aren't over, Rose, okay?
This thing is covered in diamonds.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.238
-What about Limbrey and the others?
-Don't worry about them.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.991
-[Rose] What does that mean?
-It means don't worry about it, okay?

17:14.074 --> 17:14.992
They're taken care of.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.120
They're out of the deal, all right?
I did this on my own.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.205
[Rose] Rafe, did you hurt them?

17:20.289 --> 17:24.501
No. No, uh, I didn't. [chuckles]

17:25.085 --> 17:28.338
Go home. I need you to stay out of trouble
until the morning. We're leaving tomorrow.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.257
[Rafe] Rose,
did you hear what I just said?

17:30.340 --> 17:33.677
Huh? We got the cross!
We don't have to leave now!

17:33.761 --> 17:36.805
There are bigger things going on, Rafe.
You'll see. I just need you to trust me.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.433
What are you talking--
What bigger things are going on than this?

17:39.516 --> 17:42.436
Huh? We got the cross!
We're done! Endgame! It's over!

17:42.519 --> 17:44.021
Go home. I'll meet you there.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.522
Rose!

18:00.746 --> 18:01.789
What is this?

18:01.872 --> 18:04.958
That's your future, Kiara,
if you don't turn your shit around.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.504
You're joking, right?
This is like one of those places

18:08.587 --> 18:11.131
where they kidnap you
in the middle of the night.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.633
Wilderness cuckoo's nest.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.803
No, it's a program for troubled teens
with behavioral problems.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.014
-So now I'm a troubled teen?
-What the hell would you call it?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.517
You disappear for days, Kiara,

18:22.017 --> 18:24.728
and then you come back to the house
and steal my truck.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.021
Then you go crash it.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.524
I thought John B and Sarah were dead!

18:30.734 --> 18:34.071
And you guys just wanted me to go back
to school like nothing happened!

18:34.154 --> 18:35.280
That's not what we wanted.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.991
Like everything was fine!
Nothing about that is fine!

18:38.075 --> 18:39.868
I understand
that nothing about that is fine!

18:39.952 --> 18:42.079
Nothing about any of this is fine!

18:42.162 --> 18:43.789
I'll do whatever you want!

18:44.331 --> 18:48.377
-Okay? I'll pull double shifts.
-[chuckles] You bet your ass you will.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.712
I don't want you to think
that I was wrong to help them.

18:51.713 --> 18:55.092
Because I wasn't.
I was doing what I thought was right.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.096
And I didn't mean
to do all of that to you guys!

19:02.349 --> 19:03.350
And I'm sorry.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.856
I'm sorry for sneaking out,
and I'm sorry for skipping school.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.649
It was stupid, and I… I didn't…

19:12.025 --> 19:14.862
I'm sorry for going to Charleston.
I'm sorry for stealing your truck. I--

19:14.945 --> 19:15.779
Baby…

19:17.739 --> 19:19.658
-I didn't mean--
-I… I know. I know.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.785
We love you so much,

19:23.036 --> 19:24.955
but sorry is not gonna cut it anymore.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.292
[somber instrumental music playing]

19:28.375 --> 19:31.879
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
No more sneaking out the house,

19:31.962 --> 19:33.505
no more treasure hunts,

19:34.673 --> 19:36.091
and no more Pogues.

19:37.050 --> 19:37.968
[Anna] Period.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.721
Or you're going to go to Blue Ridge.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.517
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

19:47.686 --> 19:49.021
[owl hooting]

19:49.104 --> 19:52.733
-[JJ softly] He's got the truck.
-[shushes] Stay low, stay low, stay low.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.869
How much do you wanna bet Rafe
has the cross inside that truck right now?

20:06.788 --> 20:08.498
There's only one way to find out.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.418
-[John B] Hey, hey. Wait.
-What?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.878
Look, before you volunteer

20:12.961 --> 20:15.214
on this death mission,
I need to know a couple things.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.049
[Sarah] "Death mission,"
that sounds familiar.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.635
-Okay, look, Sarah, I just have questions.
-About what?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.303
Us.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.889
-Us?
-[John B] Yeah, Sarah, come on.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.768
-[Sarah] You wanna talk about us now?
-[John B] Yes. I… I… I'm sorry, okay?

20:30.562 --> 20:31.605
I'm… I'm sorry.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.442
And… and I should have said it sooner.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.112
-[sentimental instrumental music playing]
-I want you to have this back.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.532
Will you take it?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.385
Does that answer your question?

21:02.302 --> 21:03.136
Yeah.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.474
And yeah, I want this back.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.725
[John B] Okay. Be safe.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.689
Hey! Do you want me
to perform your vows while you're at it?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.233
-Did you say "be safe"?
-Christ, could you take any longer?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.318
-[John B] I said "be safe."
-[Pope] What's she doing?

21:18.402 --> 21:20.279
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

21:23.699 --> 21:25.075
[whispers] I don't know what to do.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.743
-I need the keys!
-Come back.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.912
I'm going inside. I'll be fine.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.832
-I'll be fine.
-No. No. Don't go inside!

21:31.915 --> 21:33.667
-You said don't go in the house!
-I told her!

21:33.750 --> 21:36.503
-[Pope] Do the birdcall!
-[imitates birdcall poorly]

21:36.586 --> 21:38.422
[Pope] What?
That's not what a bird sounds like.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.923
[John B imitates birdcall]

21:40.007 --> 21:42.259
-Was that a dying chicken?
-It's not-- It's a whistle.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.469
-[John B] I'm going over.
-[horn honking]

21:45.095 --> 21:46.430
Uh, excuse me.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.598
[scoffs] Can I help ya?

21:48.682 --> 21:50.517
-[gun cocks]
-[man laughs]

21:50.600 --> 21:55.272
I got double-aught bucks in this thing,
so, uh, I can't miss.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.607
All right there, buddy, off the wall.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.861
-That's it. Yeah.
-Sir, it's not what it seems.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.031
You boys are
on the wrong side of the island.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.116
[shower running]

22:12.998 --> 22:16.084
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

22:19.671 --> 22:20.547
[softly] Shit.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.428
I think I'm gonna call the police.

22:26.511 --> 22:30.057
-You don't have to do that, sir.
-I'll decide for myself what I need to do.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.434
Sir, can I just talk to you for a minute?

22:33.268 --> 22:34.436
Just to explain.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.979
-[whispers] Hey.
-[JJ] No, I got this.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.318
Sir, I know you think we're
just some derelict kids from the Cut,

22:41.401 --> 22:43.570
but we weren't that to Mr. Cameron.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.780
[John B] Sure weren't.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.157
We were his yard workers, sir.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.701
We were just waiting
for our yard associate--

22:49.785 --> 22:50.911
-To… Tommy.
-Jay--

22:50.994 --> 22:53.705
Tommy to get back
from planting a row of flowers

22:53.789 --> 22:55.040
for Mr. Cameron's memorial.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.375
Keep talking.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.464
-[Wheezie] Oh.
-Hey!

23:02.547 --> 23:05.467
Rose was looking for you. She said
we're going on a trip or something.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.387
-I'm not going anywhere with her.
-[Wheezie sighs] Not according to her.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.222
By the way, where have you been?

23:11.014 --> 23:16.019
[sighs] Trapped in the weirdest three days
of my life. I have so much to tell you.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.355
And I'm so sorry
to ask you for another favor,

23:18.438 --> 23:20.065
but right now, I need your help.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.943
On one condition, no more leaving me.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.736
Promise.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.698
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

23:30.826 --> 23:32.327
Hey, can you help me with my suitcase?

23:34.704 --> 23:36.790
[Rafe] I'm not your slave, Wheeze.
I'm busy, okay?

23:36.873 --> 23:39.000
I… I can't get it to close.
Can you just help me?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.502
Can you not do it yourself?

23:40.585 --> 23:42.963
No. Please?

23:45.173 --> 23:46.758
Fine. Fine. All right.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.935
Oh my God, Wheeze.
We gotta make this quick, okay?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.104
I got other shit to deal with right now.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.525
Is this your suitcase?

24:05.068 --> 24:08.280
You're taking entirely too much stuff,
Wheeze. That's the problem, all right?

24:08.363 --> 24:10.782
-Don't need this.
-[Wheezie] Don't start throwing stuff!

24:10.866 --> 24:12.451
-Don't need this.
-I need this stuff!

24:12.534 --> 24:15.120
-[Rafe] You gotta learn how to downsize.
-Oh my God!

24:15.203 --> 24:18.665
[fast-paced suspenseful music playing]

24:23.879 --> 24:25.797
[Rafe] Jesus, you can't take
everything you own.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.092
-You gotta have a little self-discipline.
-Just make sure it all fits, okay?

24:46.151 --> 24:49.321
-Any other problems you want me to solve?
-Yes, no, yes!

24:49.404 --> 24:53.116
-I don't have time for this.
-No, just-- Wait, wait! Rafe, no!

24:53.200 --> 24:54.910
But, Rafe, I need all of this!

24:54.993 --> 24:57.954
-[Rafe] Figure it out!
-[Wheezie] Rafe, don't go down there!

24:58.038 --> 25:00.040
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

25:48.713 --> 25:50.715
[menacing instrumental music playing]

[panting]

25:58.974 --> 25:59.933
[whimpering]

26:00.433 --> 26:01.393
[gasps, yelps]

26:02.644 --> 26:06.022
-I really wish you didn't do that.
-Get off of me! No!

26:06.106 --> 26:07.065
-Hey.
-No!

26:07.649 --> 26:11.736
…the Knight of the Rhododendron lives on…

26:13.738 --> 26:14.614
in here.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.784
That's why we planted those flowers.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.744
-[John B] Sure. Yes.
-[Pope] Yep. That's why.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.870
You smell that, right?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.832
[sniffs] What is that,
night-blooming jasmine?

26:23.915 --> 26:26.876
No, that's more like, um… like, uh…

26:26.960 --> 26:30.213
-Sir, that's, um… natural Viagra.
-[John B] Okay!

26:30.297 --> 26:31.965
-[JJ] That's what it is.
-Really?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.426
One sniff and bam! It's hammer time!
You know what I'm saying?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.511
[Pope] Our associate Tommy
should be here any minute.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.971
We'll be quiet, all right?

26:38.054 --> 26:40.515
And we'll finish up here.
I'm sorry to bother you.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.142
-See that you do.
-[Pope] Yep.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.102
I gotta get some of those flowers.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.438
[JJ and Pope] Have a good night, sir.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.232
Let's go!

26:50.567 --> 26:51.568
[Pope] All right.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.486
[grunts] Okay.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.988
[Sarah yells] What the hell?

26:56.114 --> 26:58.575
[screams] You asshole!

26:58.658 --> 27:01.119
Rafe! Let me out!

27:01.870 --> 27:04.456
I'm not letting you out, Sarah.
Not until you calm down, okay?

27:04.539 --> 27:07.208
-Screw you!
-[Rafe] I'm trying to be civil here.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.210
-You're freaking out right now.
-What is going on?

27:09.294 --> 27:10.629
-Who is that?
-[Sarah] Rose?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.006
-[Rafe] You wanted Sarah, right?
-[Rose] That's Sarah?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.174
-[Sarah] Rose?
-Yeah.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.384
-Why is she locked in there?
-[Sarah] Rafe locked me in!

27:16.468 --> 27:20.055
She's locked in there because sometimes
you have to make the hard choice, right?

27:20.138 --> 27:22.182
She just didn't get that.

27:22.265 --> 27:25.101
You fail to understand that constantly,
don't you? Huh?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.978
Shut the hell up!

27:27.062 --> 27:29.022
-You need to calm down!
-Rafe. Rafe.

27:29.105 --> 27:32.150
[Sarah] What do you mean, calm down?
What is wrong with you?

27:32.233 --> 27:33.985
-Go upstairs. I got it.
-[Sarah] Wheeze?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.195
-All right.
-Just go.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.363
-[Sarah] Wheezie!
-Go.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.406
-[sighs]
-[banging on door]

27:38.490 --> 27:40.408
-Sarah, sweetie.
-[Sarah] Can you let me out?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.911
-You need to calm down, sweetie, okay?
-Let me out!

27:42.994 --> 27:45.413
[Rose] I really wanna help you,
but I have to go get the key.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.998
I can't let you out without the key,

27:47.082 --> 27:48.917
but I need to know
that you're gonna be calm.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.419
-I'll be right back.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

27:52.170 --> 27:54.255
Rose! Rose!

27:54.756 --> 27:58.843
Please… please don't leave! [whimpering]

27:58.927 --> 28:00.929
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

28:11.272 --> 28:12.232
Sarah?

28:14.192 --> 28:16.027
-[weakly] Rose. Hey.
-Hey.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.822
-I need to call 911. We need to call--
-Okay, sit down.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.949
-[Sarah hyperventilating]
-What happened?

28:21.574 --> 28:25.203
Take a deep breath. Hey. [inhales deeply]
Take a deep breath. It's okay.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.581
It's okay.

28:29.416 --> 28:33.503
[voice breaking] I came home,
and, um, I was looking for something.

28:33.586 --> 28:37.132
-And there's a truck outside.
-Here, here. Take some tea.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.802
There's a body back there.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.013
-We need to turn him in.
-We'll get to the bottom of it, okay?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.891
-Will you help me call?
-I will help you. Here, drink some tea.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.276
I'm afraid Rafe
has killed someone else. [sniffles]

28:56.985 --> 28:58.737
And last time he did that…

29:00.989 --> 29:04.367
Dad took the blame,
and you see where that got him.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.369
[Rose] Sarah, you're absolutely right.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.372
I told your dad so many times
there was something wrong with Rafe.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.249
-[Sarah] I'm so tired of it.
-I know.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.586
You just need to calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

29:14.669 --> 29:15.545
[sniffles]

29:15.628 --> 29:18.256
-You need to rest, Sarah.
-I don't need--

29:18.339 --> 29:20.133
-[Rose] No, you do.
-I'm fine.

29:20.216 --> 29:23.970
And then when you wake up,
everything's gonna be so much better.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.972
Yeah, we're gonna go on a little trip.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.641
What do you think about that?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.769
[hyperventilating]

29:30.852 --> 29:32.228
What… what'd you do?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.441
[voice breaking] I'm really sorry.

29:37.525 --> 29:40.195
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you,
I promise.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.281
I promise nothing bad is gonna happen
to you, but I needed you to rest.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.199
No.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.243
I had to do whatever it takes
to keep this family together, Sarah.

29:57.712 --> 29:58.838
Rafe, wait.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.799
I just talked to Sarah.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.301
She said there's a dead body
in the truck, right?

30:05.553 --> 30:06.763
Yeah.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.474
That's Renfield.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.644
I didn't do shit.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.105
I didn't do shit, okay?

30:16.189 --> 30:17.482
Limbrey shot him.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.444
I took the truck, and I left the old lady
at the hangar, all right?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
I got the cross for all of us, okay?

30:25.907 --> 30:26.741
I did!

30:27.325 --> 30:30.328
And I was just getting ready to take care
of Renfield when you came up.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.497
You should be… you should be thanking me.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.087
Do what you have to do with the body.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.382
Get the cross to the wharf.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.469
I'm on it.

30:47.595 --> 30:48.972
I got it on lock, Rose.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.933
-[John B] Get down! Get down!
-[Pope] That's Rafe.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.227
-[JJ] Get down! No, wait! Not yet!
-[Pope] Hey, stop!

30:54.310 --> 30:56.187
[John B] Then what do we do?
What's the plan?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.815
[JJ] Well, he might have the gun,
so, uh, what's in our favor?

30:58.898 --> 31:01.442
The element of surprise,
that's what's in our favor right now.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.028
-[John B] What can we surprise him with?
-He's got my cross.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.864
-[JJ] I'm working on it!
-[John B] Come on.

31:05.947 --> 31:09.200
-[JJ] What if we threw something in front?
-[John B] Threw what, where? In the tree?

31:09.284 --> 31:10.702
[JJ] Slingshot. Yeah.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.162
[Pope grunting]

31:15.456 --> 31:16.791
-Pope!
-[Pope panting]

31:18.626 --> 31:20.628
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

31:34.225 --> 31:35.226
What was that shit?

31:36.978 --> 31:39.939
-We got the house right there.
-Rafe's gone. Now let's storm the fort.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.190
[John B] Let's think.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.650
-Get down.
-Who's that?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.360
-[Rose] Watch her feet!
-[John B] Rose.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.653
[JJ] Dude, they got Sarah.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.113
She was freaking out.

31:47.196 --> 31:50.533
[grunts] I gave her an anti-anxiety pill.
She begged me for it, but she'll be fine.

31:50.617 --> 31:51.743
[John B] What'd they do?

31:51.826 --> 31:54.078
-[Rose] Here, watch her head!
-[Wheezie] Okay.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.457
Here we go.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.708

-[screams]
-[JJ] Hey, Wheezie! Unlock the door!

32:15.266 --> 32:16.351
What the hell?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.936
-Why can't I let him in?
-[Rose] No!

32:18.019 --> 32:19.187
-Wake up!
-[Rose] No!

32:19.270 --> 32:20.730
-Wheezie! Unlock the door!
-I'm sorry.

-[JJ shouts indistinctly]
-[car engine revving]

32:25.318 --> 32:27.654

Let's get to the Twinkie, man. Come on!

-[grunts] You good?
-[John B] Yeah.

32:29.405 --> 32:32.033
-[JJ] Come on! You want me to drive?
-[John B] No, I got it.

-Pope, what happened?

35:44.517 --> 35:47.520
Rafe, he has the cross. [winces]

35:47.603 --> 35:49.272
Kiara, I need you to come get me.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.278
This is really bad timing.

Please, Kie. I need your help.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.660
Okay. Okay. I'm coming. Where are you?

I'm at the swamp past Angel Oak.
Please hurry.

-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.663
What the hell happened?

36:47.747 --> 36:49.707
[Pope] You won't believe me
when I tell you.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.796
That's her! That's her!
Quarter mile on the left! Quarter mile!

36:55.880 --> 36:57.882
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

37:01.802 --> 37:03.137
[tires screeching]

37:04.388 --> 37:07.892
[engine sputtering]

37:15.399 --> 37:18.069
We did it, ol' girl. We did it.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.196
Morning, Mrs. Cameron.

37:22.782 --> 37:27.161
Pope, listen,
when all of this is over, and I go home,

37:27.245 --> 37:29.580
my parents
are probably gonna send me away.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.502
I just wanna make sure
that we're straight.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.964
You know, I might not see you
for a really long time,

37:38.881 --> 37:40.132
and after that night…

37:42.301 --> 37:44.345
if I… if I hurt your feelings…

37:46.347 --> 37:47.265
You didn't.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.059
It's good.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.396
-But I… I feel like I did.
-Kie. Kie.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.439
I promise you it's okay.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.359
We're friends,

37:59.902 --> 38:00.820
and that's first.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.950
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

38:26.053 --> 38:28.139
[guard] Hey. [speaking indistinctly]

38:28.222 --> 38:30.057
-[driver] Uh, lot B.
-[guard] That's right.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.822
[men shouting indistinctly]

38:50.578 --> 38:51.454
Shit.

38:52.079 --> 38:54.206
[JJ] Wait. The Coastal Venture.
Dude, I know that ship.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.834
My dad did legs on her last summer.
It's a total tramp steamer.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.377
I worked on her in port.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.005
-There's the cross. Right there. Look.
-All right, send her up.

39:01.922 --> 39:02.923
Go ahead.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.928
-Pain in the ass to get this.
-[men chuckle]

39:08.554 --> 39:11.474
[men shouting indistinctly]

39:12.058 --> 39:13.225
[JJ] God, I hate that guy.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.852
-[Rose] Come on, baby.
-[Sarah grunts]

39:15.478 --> 39:16.937
-[grunts]
-[John B] There she is.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.776
-JJ, we gotta come up with a plan.
-I know. I'm working on it.

39:21.859 --> 39:26.155
If we get over to that barge, we go over.
We'll have to get into the water, though.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.282
-That's fine.
-Then we're gonna be sitting ducks.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.450
[Kie] Howdy.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.203
Whoa! I was about to stab your eyes out.

39:32.286 --> 39:35.539
-[chuckles] You look scared as shit.
-[JJ] How'd you guys even find us?

39:35.623 --> 39:37.666
-[Kie] Geo-located your phone.
-[JJ] Smart.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.293
You okay? What happened?

39:39.377 --> 39:40.628
Rafe, round three.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.631
-You freaking kidding me? Again?
-This was a tie.

39:43.714 --> 39:44.673
You good?

39:45.341 --> 39:47.426
-[Pope] Is that the cross?
-[JJ] Yep.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.720
[men shouting indistinctly]

39:50.304 --> 39:53.099
-[John B] They're holding Sarah hostage.
-[Kie] We have to get on that boat.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.184
[JJ] First we gotta get past
the goon squad.

39:55.267 --> 39:58.229
Okay, let's move. Come on.
Pope, what're you doing?

39:58.312 --> 39:59.814
I have an idea. Just trust me.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.316
[John B] No, hey, stop running!
We gotta go, dude.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.111
Trust me, man.
Go. I'll meet up with you guys. Go.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.197
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

40:17.623 --> 40:19.500
[hissing]

40:32.138 --> 40:33.222
[exhales deeply]

40:40.146 --> 40:40.980
[gun fires]

40:43.482 --> 40:45.484
-[man 1] Oh, man!
-[man 2] What the hell?

40:47.236 --> 40:49.280
[men yelling indistinctly]

40:49.363 --> 40:51.449
-[panting]
-[man 3] Move! Go! Move it!

40:51.532 --> 40:54.118
-[man 4] Where'd it come from?
-[man 5] Over there.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.703
[fire alarm blaring]

40:55.786 --> 40:58.289
[man 6] Go, go! Call the fire department!

40:59.457 --> 41:00.666
It's working.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.464
Pope, what was that? Huh?

41:06.547 --> 41:10.176
Look. That container's going on the ship.
We can get in that way.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.386
-Are you with me?
-You're a genius.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.222
Let's go. Hey, this way. Come on. come on.

41:19.768 --> 41:20.978
[JJ] Wait. They're right there.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.147
-[Pope grunts]
-[JJ] Wait. Whoa.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.400
-Did you think this through?
-Yes. This is the plan.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.944
That's a trap right there.
We can't get out once we get in.

41:29.028 --> 41:32.114
-[Pope] I know!
-You guys don't have to come. Right?

41:32.198 --> 41:34.617
-Right. This is our fight.
-[John B] Yeah, right.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.202
[grunts]

41:36.285 --> 41:38.162
-Nothing to lose?
-Nothing to lose.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.165
[JJ grunts]

41:41.665 --> 41:43.792
[Kie] Guess it's better
than boarding school.

41:45.419 --> 41:46.462
[JJ] Go, go, go, go!

41:50.925 --> 41:53.135
[John B shushing]

41:55.221 --> 41:56.555
[man 1] That was nuts!

41:56.639 --> 41:58.682
[man 2] Something
like that'll wake you up, huh?

41:58.766 --> 42:01.602
-[sirens blaring]
-[indistinct chattering over radio]

42:01.685 --> 42:03.896
[man 3] Looks like
they got it under control.

42:03.979 --> 42:06.690
[man 4] It ain't under control
unless we get these containers loaded.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.612
Okay. She's good to go. Lock her up.

42:12.279 --> 42:15.950
-[man 5] Keep a short line on that one.
-[man 6] Looks to be okay though.

42:17.451 --> 42:20.037
[man 7] This is the last one.
Get her over there.

42:20.120 --> 42:23.290
[man 8] We're gonna keep it shut down
until it's checked out.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.751

What's that?

[metal clanking]

43:06.083 --> 43:08.294
[all groaning, grunting]

43:09.211 --> 43:10.296
[Pope] Jesus Christ!

43:20.264 --> 43:21.890
[man 1] He's swinging it around.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.184
[man 2] I'll get on the horn.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.352
[man 3] Right there.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.438
[men shouting indistinctly]

43:29.648 --> 43:31.567
[all grunting, groaning]

43:31.650 --> 43:32.735
[man 1] You're good.

43:33.694 --> 43:34.903
[man 2] That's it!

43:39.908 --> 43:40.909
[metal clanking]

43:40.993 --> 43:42.161
-We made it.
-[shushing]

43:42.244 --> 43:43.245
[Kie] Be quiet, JJ.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.249
What?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.585
I thought I heard something.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.511
[banging on door]

44:00.346 --> 44:01.972
What? What was it?

44:10.439 --> 44:11.523
See anything?

44:13.942 --> 44:15.069
Nah.

44:22.242 --> 44:24.495
-[boat horn blasting]
-[gasps]

44:54.650 --> 44:56.610
Why do they keep doing this shit?

45:02.658 --> 45:03.534
Assholes.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.495
I can't believe this.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.759
[footsteps approaching]
