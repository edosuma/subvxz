00:01.680 --> 00:03.716
<i>Even though it can be tough around here,</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:07.031
<i>sometimes God gives you little gifts</i>
<i>to get you through the day.</i>

00:14.360 --> 00:17.432
- Grab a mop...
- Shush. Watching <i>The Sixth Sense.</i>

00:17.520 --> 00:19.351
There's a mess in the hallway.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.672
- This kid sees dead people.
- That film is at least five years old.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.432
So what? I haven't seen it.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.797
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.314
He's been dead the entire time.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.709
Oh! All the best.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.598
No! No!

00:37.680 --> 00:39.910
You guys, I'm so excited about tonight.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.911
We're just going to a nightclub.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.673
No, Carla. An African-American club.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.830
Promise me you'll be cool.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.992
<i>In Turk's defence,</i>
<i>we had tried this once before.</i>

00:52.600 --> 00:53.794
You can't touch me.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.434
<i>And once before that.</i>

00:59.080 --> 01:01.674
Yeah, boy!

01:03.800 --> 01:06.030
Man. It's only 10.00.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.151
<i>But, hey, the third time's a charm.</i>

01:10.240 --> 01:12.196
All right, you three can go in.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.998
- Word.
- Uh-uh. You're out.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.436
- Oh, look, sir...
- Baby, I got this. Listen here, man.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.796
He's a little out of his mizzle,
so for just a little bizzle,

01:20.880 --> 01:23.678
if you let him up in this pizzle,
he'll be all chizzle.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.958
You out, too.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.429
Sir, this is for idiot number one,

01:28.520 --> 01:30.397
and this is for idiot number two.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.112
Come on, you fool.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.478
Oh, I knew I'd get in!

01:40.560 --> 01:42.551
Just don't lose your head, Bambi.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.668
Oh!

01:50.800 --> 01:54.349
Turk! J.D.'s doing the...

02:01.360 --> 02:02.759
Oh, God.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.478
<i>After two hours</i>
<i>of roboting I was parched.</i>

02:08.960 --> 02:11.235
<i>And that's when I saw Kylie.</i>

02:15.120 --> 02:17.588
Hi. Can you make me an appletini?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.671
I hope so. It's my favourite drink.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.716
<i>Oh, my God. That's a sign!</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:23.950
<i>If only she had</i>
<i>my goofy sense of humour.</i>

02:24.040 --> 02:26.474
Out of vodka. Let me go
downstairs and get more.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.637
I've been working on my fake stair walk.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.472
<i>OK, time to move in for the kill.</i>

02:36.560 --> 02:40.109
<i>Work the fact you're a doctor</i>
<i>into the conversation. Just be subtle.</i>

02:40.200 --> 02:43.749
I'm a doctor. John Dorian.
Most of my patients live.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.196
This is so weird.
I've been looking for a doctor...

02:47.280 --> 02:49.396
<i>My God, look at those beautiful eyes.</i>

02:49.480 --> 02:51.789
<i>They're so big I can see myself in them.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:53.950
<i>Wow! How cute am I?</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:57.828
So it's probably nothing big, but I'm
wondering if you could check it out.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.150
You got it.
Come by Sacred Heart tomorrow.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.312
I have clinic hours.
After all, I'm a doctor.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.713
You're gonna date a patient.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.110
I hope she has something that keeps
her here so you get to know her.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.794
I gotta thank you for taking
a special interest.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.313
He's just excited

03:14.400 --> 03:17.790
because he wishes he dated more
sexy black women when he was single.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.233
At least he married one.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.594
Todd, I'm not black.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.716
Right. And I'm not straight.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.872
Do you ever get that special
fluttery feeling in your heart

03:25.960 --> 03:28.713
when you feel like a woman's
about to change your life?

03:28.800 --> 03:32.270
Hey, J. D! This is my boyfriend James.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.555
Thanks again for seeing him.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.598
How's your heart?
The fluttering has stopped.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.955
There. Is she black?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.400 --> 03:54.958
Be with you in a second.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.439
Thanks, doc.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.876
It's funny. I thought you said
you were the one who needed a doctor.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.439
No. I told you it was James.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.431
Oh. How could I not have heard that?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.272
Remember, I said...

04:05.360 --> 04:07.351
<i>My God, look at those beautiful eyes.</i>

04:07.440 --> 04:09.476
<i>They're so b... You're doing it again!</i>

04:09.560 --> 04:11.357
So I'll see you in there.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.431
OK. In there I'll see you.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.108
Oh, man! I can't believe it's over.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.111
Dude, it's not that serious.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.113
There could be a window, but you have to
get in there and fish for information.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.954
You don't want to lose this hottie!
She is a slamming hottie, and you...

04:27.040 --> 04:28.029
Turk.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.315
I got this. Baby,
you know you're his world.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.915
I'm going for it. But, you know,
I gotta go in there hot.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.719
Turk, what's that joke
that Mickhead always tells?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.916
Dude, a guy walks
into a dentist's office

04:39.000 --> 04:40.638
and says, "I think I'm a moth."

04:40.720 --> 04:43.314
The dentist then says,
"If you think you're a moth,

04:43.400 --> 04:45.550
why'd you come to the dentist's office?"

04:45.640 --> 04:47.995
The guy then says,
"Well, the light was on."

04:48.960 --> 04:51.713
That moth was crazy.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.199
Hey, I heard a great joke.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.590
A guys walks into a dentist's office
and says, "I think I'm a moth."

04:56.680 --> 04:58.989
The dentist says,
"If you think you're a moth,

04:59.080 --> 05:02.117
why are you in a dentist's office?"
<i>I forgot the punch line.</i>

05:02.200 --> 05:05.749
<i>You can't bail out now. Stall, stall!</i>

05:05.840 --> 05:08.035
So the moth says,

05:08.120 --> 05:09.997
"That's a good question.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.911
What kind of dentist are you?"

05:12.000 --> 05:14.514
And the dentist says,
"I'm a general dentist,

05:14.600 --> 05:16.670
but I do dabble in orthodontry,

05:16.760 --> 05:19.911
braces and such," and the moth says,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.719
"Orthodontry?
I hear there's great money in that."

05:22.800 --> 05:23.949
<i>The light was on!</i>

05:24.040 --> 05:27.396
"To answer your original question,
which was if I think I'm a moth,

05:27.480 --> 05:31.029
why am I in a dentist's office,
the answer is because the light was on."

05:33.360 --> 05:36.909
The light. It was the light, James.
Moths love light.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.118
So, other than your funny bone being
broken, what seems to be the problem?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.760
Had a fever and stomach-ache
for almost a week.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.070
OK, well, let's get
a little history on you.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.832
<i>Time to go fishing for some info.</i>

05:47.920 --> 05:49.717
You ever have shortness of breath,

05:49.800 --> 05:53.475
for instance when you're walking Kylie
to the apartment that you share?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.074
- We don't live together.
- <i>Window! Window!</i>

05:56.160 --> 05:59.232
Oh, so you're waiting
until you get married.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.038
We're not engaged.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.635
I don't have shortness of breath,
but my right knee is a little puffy.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.518
Maybe that's from dragging
your feet. Am I right?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.511
She knows! OK.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.990
<i>Using patient histories to your</i>
<i>advantage is an old doctor trick.</i>

06:13.080 --> 06:16.550
<i>What a doctor says and what they mean</i>
<i>are often two different things.</i>

06:16.640 --> 06:20.474
Dr Robbins treated your husband but
we'll approach this case differently.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.558
It's very comforting to have
the chief of medicine here.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.791
I took a special interest in this case.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.555
Thank you.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.069
Hey, Elliot.
Your boobies look hot today.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.752
Mr Cheng's test results
show that he's in renal failure.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.354
We're waiting for the results
of his blood smear.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.796
I saw his chart before
I went to the bakery. He's got malaria.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.634
And you were going to tell him this
after you had a sticky bun?

06:48.720 --> 06:52.838
He's going to live at least another 12
hours and the bakery closes at 5.00.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.832
But we've gotta get moving on this.
What should we do?

06:55.920 --> 06:58.992
Nothing. Mr Cheng
is not long for this world.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.072
Do you believe that guy?

07:03.160 --> 07:07.472
I never cease to be amazed by the depth
of his cynicism and callousness.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.471
So what do you think we should do?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.677
I don't care. I'm going home
to watch the Lakers play the Heat.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.990
It's the game of the year,
Shaq versus Kobe.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.640
You are going to stay
and deal with this yourself.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.948
Shaq versus Kobe?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.031
All the best. Ooh! Let it happen.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.873
Three, two, one.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.992
What's this stretch good for?

07:29.080 --> 07:32.072
It loosens up my chest.
You should probably stretch too.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.550
Don't need to. I got a tube of
Bengay on each one of my hamstrings.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.312
How are things going with Kylie?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.392
OK. Is there some special way
to get a black girl to like you?

07:40.480 --> 07:46.157
When a black girl asks you if her ass
looks big, you say, "Hell, yeah."

07:46.240 --> 07:47.389
- All right.
- OK?

07:47.480 --> 07:50.552
- You want to play some ball?
- Hell, yes.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.277
Dr Kelso, I've thought about it,

07:53.360 --> 07:56.352
and I am not going to just
wait for Mr Cheng to die.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.237
- Excuse me?
- Are you kidding me?

07:58.320 --> 08:01.630
Barbie going toe to toe with Big Bob
in a battle of the annoyings?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.358
Well, happy birthday to me!

08:03.440 --> 08:05.431
We should do an exchange transfusion.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.195
The southpaw with the blonde bangs
and big britches comes out swinging!

08:09.280 --> 08:12.397
The man is 72
and in multi-system organ dysfunction.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.948
It's done. It's parasites one,
person zero,

08:15.040 --> 08:17.190
If you tell that family
he's got a chance,

08:17.280 --> 08:19.396
all you're doing is raising their hopes.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.436
Oh, tremendous body blow!

08:21.520 --> 08:24.034
Oh, and for the record,
we're not colleagues.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.917
I don't care what you think.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.030
The fight goes
to the stocky middleweight

08:30.120 --> 08:32.076
from Monroeville, Pennsylvania.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.232
Perry, Mickhead called in sick.
I need you to work tonight.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.595
That's all and good,
but I'm not available.

08:37.679 --> 08:41.592
There is no chance I am missing
this game. No chance, no how.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.750
What the...

08:43.840 --> 08:47.469
Say, Bob, what the hell
happened in your office?

08:47.560 --> 08:50.597
Every year, the med students
get me with a practical joke.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.433
They messed with
the speed control on my treadmill.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.796
What I can't figure is
how they got into my office.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.916
Here's the key to Kelso's office.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.275
And here's Nurse Tisdale's phone number.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.636
I don't have any idea how
they might've gotten in here, Bob.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.757
If you think I'm missing
the biggest game of the year...

09:14.840 --> 09:19.277
I hate to interrupt, but I'm still woozy
from being shot into my wall,

09:19.360 --> 09:23.717
so why don't you just go work your shift
and use my VCR to tape the game?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.191
When did you get this?

09:27.280 --> 09:30.272
Right about the time
we couldn't afford that MRI machine.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.158
Of course you did.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.198
Hey, Kylie, I wrote down
that moth joke for you.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.838
Wow.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.480
<i>Give her a compliment.</i>
<i>Tell her she has a huge ass.</i>

09:40.560 --> 09:42.790
- You...
- What happened to your eye?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.678
It's a little embarrassing.
I was playing basket...

09:45.760 --> 09:48.638
Embarrassing for me, actually.
See... Wingman time.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.312
We were playing basketball,

09:50.400 --> 09:53.039
and he scored eight buckets
in a row on yours truly.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.792
- I alley-ooped him.
- Shut up.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.314
You could've used J.D. At Seton Hall.

09:57.400 --> 10:01.075
The soup kitchen where you volunteer
called... You played at Seton Hall?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.479
All four years.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.518
- Get out of here!
- Did the soup kitchen have a message?

10:05.600 --> 10:08.637
They're out of broth. What was
it like playing college ball?

10:08.720 --> 10:12.030
Sweetie, I'm gonna go
to the cafeteria and get you a coffee.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.998
Hell, no! Sweetie ain't drinking
no cafeteria coffee.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.550
Sweetie, you are drinking
the coffee from the doctors' lounge.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.200
Let's... Seton Hall, huh? Yeah!

10:21.280 --> 10:23.350
Thank you.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.432
It's the test results.
Let's see what's going on.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.910
Your gramstain shows that you have...

10:31.720 --> 10:33.597
You have gonorrhoea.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.393
We should probably test Kylie
to see if she's infected.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.995
No, we haven't slept together, yet.
It's not like I'm missing out.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.789
I probably got it from my secretary.
Or that trainer from the gym.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.713
Or this fine chick Tamyra
that bartends with Kylie.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.233
Yeah!

10:50.320 --> 10:52.788
We should probably get you fixed up

10:52.880 --> 10:55.758
or things might start
falling off of you.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.512
Listen up.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.036
I have been cursed to work
the night shift with you chuckleheads,

11:01.120 --> 11:03.839
which means I have to tape
the Laker-Heat game,

11:03.920 --> 11:06.480
and seeing as no one
in the history of this germbox

11:06.560 --> 11:09.950
has ever made made it through a shift
without saying, "Oh, my God!

11:10.040 --> 11:13.555
Did you see what happened last night
on <i>America's Fattest Fatties?</i>

11:13.640 --> 11:15.756
A 900-pound woman
lost a pound and a half

11:15.840 --> 11:17.831
and cried for 20 minutes." Be warned.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.798
If you utter a word
about the score of the game,

11:20.880 --> 11:24.316
it will be your last. Now get out!

11:24.400 --> 11:27.039
Go, go, go, go! Chop, chop!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.190
<i>What drives people to seek revenge?</i>

11:30.920 --> 11:34.469
So... you don't want to know
the ending of something.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.994
I can relate to that.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.479
What is that in your lap?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.711
Leonard. Half-kitten, half-monkey.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.355
Unfortunately, with his system failing,

11:47.440 --> 11:50.273
Dr Reid and I have agreed
there's nothing more we can do.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.352
<i>What drives people</i>
<i>to go back on their word?</i>

11:53.440 --> 11:55.158
If we do an exchange transfusion,

11:55.240 --> 11:57.356
there's a chance
we can save your father.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.000
Oh! Thank you, thank you!

12:00.080 --> 12:01.957
Thank you, thank you!

12:02.040 --> 12:03.758
You have to keep this between us.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.593
You know, doctor-patient
confidentiality, right?

12:06.680 --> 12:09.114
<i>And what do you do</i>
<i>when every fibre of your being</i>

12:09.200 --> 12:11.634
<i>wants to say something,</i>
<i>but you know you can't.</i>

12:11.720 --> 12:14.188
Hey! What are you guys talking about?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.394
Nothing.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.190
Why do all the good ones have
boyfriends with venereal diseases,

12:27.280 --> 12:30.238
but you can't say anything
cos you're the guy's doctor?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.311
I am so sick of men screwing women over,

12:32.400 --> 12:36.109
like cheating on them or using your
lavender bath gel to wash their car.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.997
You did not just compare cheating

12:38.080 --> 12:40.435
and getting gonorrhoea
to me using your soap.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.877
I'm just saying men let you down.
J.D., you have to tell her.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.714
J.D. Took the Hippocratic oath.
There's no way around it.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.148
Is there an "A"?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.708
Yes, there is.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.472
Yes!

12:58.560 --> 13:01.916
There may be a way around it.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.797
Thanks.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.315
Ooh! Barbie, you are up there
without a net this time.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.755
I sure do hope Mr Cheng rallies for you

13:13.840 --> 13:17.674
because if he doesn't, you're gonna
be hearing Bob Kelso's voice saying,

13:17.760 --> 13:21.309
"Sweetheart, I told you so"
from now until you're two inches shorter

13:21.400 --> 13:24.551
and driving around Florida
with your left-hand blinker on.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.358
Now it's time to ruin the game.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.591
- Come with me to the window.
- Do you have some elaborate plan?

13:29.680 --> 13:33.150
I do. I convinced everybody
that's afraid of me to go outside

13:33.240 --> 13:34.832
and spell out the score.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.911
- Really?
- No, you idiot.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.389
I'm just gonna tell you
the score of the game,

13:39.480 --> 13:41.755
maybe knock your head against the glass.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.673
I was way out of line telling
you how that movie ended,

13:44.760 --> 13:47.228
but, God save me, watching sports

13:47.320 --> 13:50.278
is one of the last pure
pleasures I have left in my life,

13:50.360 --> 13:52.555
so you tell me what's it gonna take

13:52.640 --> 13:55.108
for you to let me go home,
sit in my massage chair,

13:55.200 --> 13:56.872
and enjoy the game?

13:57.720 --> 14:01.110
I would like to perform
open heart surgery.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.760
- No.
- How about you perform surgery on me

14:03.840 --> 14:05.990
- so that I can breathe underwater?
- No.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.719
- I would like a shark that read minds.
- No.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.268
- You and I trade lives for a year.
- No.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.874
A meal and an hour
in your massage chair?

14:13.960 --> 14:16.235
- Done.
- Done.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.469
Hey, guys, it's off.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.637
Wow! You guys are organised.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.510
Hey, did you catch
that Lakers-Heat game?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.511
Five seconds left...

14:41.960 --> 14:44.269
I can't believe you make
$300 in tips a night.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.476
This is why doctors
should have tip jars.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.710
I make three bucks
for serving a martini.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.270
You put your lips on the mouth of
a dead guy and bring him back to life.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.555
That's gotta be worth
at least a five spot.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.870
I should be getting back to James.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.999
There's no rush. A nurse is up there
right now getting some blood from him.

15:05.080 --> 15:09.232
I'm sorry! It's never taken me
12 pokes to find a vein.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.630
Got it!

15:12.720 --> 15:16.554
I should've brought my laptop.
I could've gotten so much work done.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.437
You can bartend on-line?

15:18.520 --> 15:20.317
I work to pay for grad school.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.868
I'm getting my master's
in political science.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.394
I love politics! Ask me anything.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.870
<i>What are you doing?!</i>
<i>You don't know anything about politics!</i>

15:28.960 --> 15:32.316
<i>Unless she asks about Bush</i>
<i>or the bald assistant president.</i>

15:32.400 --> 15:34.516
Did you know only 17°% of people

15:34.600 --> 15:37.114
under the age of 25 voted last year?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.111
You can vote if you're under 25?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.191
<i>The only thing you can take solace in</i>

15:41.280 --> 15:44.352
<i>is a girl like her would probably</i>
<i>never be interested in you.</i>

15:44.440 --> 15:47.557
I can't believe a cute guy
like you doesn't have a girlfriend.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.471
If I was single, I'd snatch you up.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.597
Would you like to play
a game of hangman?

15:54.440 --> 15:56.795
<i>As I sat there letting</i>
<i>my interns do all my work,</i>

15:56.880 --> 15:59.075
<i>I wondered if there</i>
<i>was a parallel universe</i>

15:59.160 --> 16:01.515
<i>where another J.D.</i>
<i>And Kylie could be together</i>

16:01.600 --> 16:04.831
<i>because there's no Hippocratic oath</i>
<i>on planet Glornack Seven.</i>

16:04.920 --> 16:07.480
- Are you on Glornack Seven?
- Why are you so happy?

16:07.560 --> 16:10.916
I just did an exchange transfusion
on my malaria patient in there,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.877
and he just woke up from his coma.

16:12.960 --> 16:17.078
Well, he woke up to a world of bad
boyfriends, oaths, and gonorrhoea.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.559
He did. You know why?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.996
Because I broke the rules and ignored
what Dr Kelso wanted me to do.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.036
<i>Sometimes you have to break the rules.</i>

16:24.120 --> 16:26.714
<i>Elliot's patient waking up</i>
<i>was a clear sign.</i>

16:26.800 --> 16:29.758
Mr Cheng is crashing.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.673
<i>Signs be damned! I'm telling her.</i>

16:32.760 --> 16:35.832
Kylie! Kylie!

16:38.600 --> 16:41.319
You can't tell her!
They won't let you be a doctor!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.152
I'd make more money bartending!

16:43.240 --> 16:47.950
Turk, if we leave right now, I might
be awake for sex tonight. Get my coat.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.156
You owe me.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.711
Baby, so I didn't know which one
was yours, so I grabbed all of them.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.759
Just give me a second. I need to talk
to Elliot, and then I gotta clock out.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.115
And then we have sex?
Then we have sex, OK.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.640
I really thought he had a shot.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.553
Well, the family's downstairs
whenever you're ready to talk to them.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.909
Go ahead. Call me
sweetheart and tell me

17:28.000 --> 17:30.070
I'm a pathetic excuse for a doctor.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.470
You made a bold decision
and it bit you in the keister.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.559
Yeah.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.757
I don't like people disagreeing with me.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.435
There's not another resident here
who has the guts to do it.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.238
I feel so guilty about Mr Cheng.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.198
Could you at least just make fun
of my bangs or something?

17:47.280 --> 17:48.838
Take it from a colleague,

17:48.920 --> 17:52.151
Telling that family what happened
after getting their hopes up

17:52.240 --> 17:54.595
is going to be far worse
than any shot I can take

17:54.680 --> 17:57.035
at that John Denver
haircut you're sporting.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.997
Did... Did you just
call me a colleague?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.470
I did. But I hate my colleagues.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.077
What the hell are you doing?

18:09.160 --> 18:10.559
I get to have sex.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.232
I hate this place.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.676
I get to have sex tonight!

18:17.320 --> 18:20.596
- Hey, Kylie, there you are.
- Hey, J.D.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.671
<i>This is your moment! Grab it!</i>

18:22.760 --> 18:25.911
<i>Listen, Kylie... Out loud,</i>
<i>you idiot! Out loud!</i>

18:26.000 --> 18:29.037
I wanted to thank you
for being such a great doctor.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.033
<i>And there it was.</i>
<i>Great doctors don't break oaths.</i>

18:36.360 --> 18:39.113
Thanks again for everything.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.837
<i>Someone once said</i>
<i>the bad guys always win.</i>

18:43.920 --> 18:46.434
<i>Sometimes the bad guy</i>
<i>is a jerk boyfriend.</i>

18:51.720 --> 18:53.711
<i>It's finally here...</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:56.598
<i>the long-awaited showdown</i>
<i>between Shaq and Kobe.</i>

18:56.680 --> 18:59.399
<i>Sometimes the bad guy</i>
<i>is the man you've been battling</i>

18:59.480 --> 19:01.072
<i>for as long as you can remember.</i>

19:01.160 --> 19:05.233
<i>Hey, Perry! 98-97 Lakers. Kobe dunked</i>
<i>over Shaq for the game winner.</i>

19:06.400 --> 19:09.437
<i>Don't ever mess with my treadmill.</i>

19:15.000 --> 19:17.753
Is this homemade gravy?

19:21.360 --> 19:25.478
<i>And sometimes the bad guy is a disease</i>
<i>that you didn't stand a chance against.</i>

19:25.560 --> 19:28.757
But you said he could get better.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.831
I'm so sorry.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.912
<i>I guess all you can do is come back</i>
<i>to work the next morning</i>

19:34.000 --> 19:36.355
<i>and hope that being a good guy pays off.</i>

19:37.920 --> 19:39.353
What are you doing here?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.431
My girlfriend Tamyra from the club,

19:41.520 --> 19:45.069
she's also feeling a little sick,
and you'll never guess what she has.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.878
Gonorrhoea!

19:46.960 --> 19:49.997
I mean... gonorrhoea.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.993
Kylie, I wanted to tell you so badly,
but, you know, it's against the rules.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.558
You can tell me now.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.158
Your boyfriend's a jerk.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.231
He's not my boyfriend.
