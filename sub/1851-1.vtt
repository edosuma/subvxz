She lives.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.729

00:43.947 --> 00:45.836
This is the covenant.

00:47.962 --> 00:50.845
Is done.

01:45.702 --> 01:47.142
The Impaler

03:40.540 --> 03:42.223
Why, yes!

03:46.002 --> 03:47.002

03:47.403 --> 03:49.074
Why, yes!

03:51.213 --> 03:52.213
Do you want to go?

03:54.011 --> 03:56.915
Do you feel the pressure, buddy?
What will you do when the pressure is on?

03:57.409 --> 04:00.237
You're a little bitch, man!
You're a little bitch!

04:00.513 --> 04:02.761
And that affects your game.
And I look at you I will...

04:03.323 --> 04:06.724
One hundred US dollars, if you do this.

04:07.801 --> 04:09.521
What is that, double your capital friend?

04:10.998 --> 04:13.510
Oh, you just have to concentrate.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.178
It is very difficult to concentrate.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.675
Oh, shit!

04:19.281 --> 04:20.442
No way, man!

04:23.904 --> 04:25.322
This comes on the heels!

04:25.821 --> 04:29.358
You know, I'm not sure this game, anyway
why actually...

04:29.359 --> 04:32.352
I want to drink a few beers and
know that I never lose in this.

04:32.353 --> 04:33.353
Are you ready?

04:34.132 --> 04:35.132
Now I have this.

04:38.079 --> 04:41.371
Oh, my God.

04:42.652 --> 04:45.165
I know, I will not say anything.
I will not say anything.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.450
Oh, baby!
- Bart.

04:51.317 --> 04:55.932
Around this place, apparently
it is good join this charm.

04:57.057 --> 04:59.684
I'm happy that you found
a use for that stupid thing.

05:00.036 --> 05:02.627
Wait, I'll let you know
that this is a piece

05:02.639 --> 05:05.015
More advanced technology on the planet.

05:05.265 --> 05:10.835
And you use to enter the "Redtube"
to watch porn at the speed of 4G...

05:10.836 --> 05:13.383
I do not think Steve Jobs has had that intention

05:13.395 --> 05:16.110
I think that when
revolutionary piece of technology.

05:16.111 --> 05:18.601
Well, have you seen
Steve Jobs and his friends? - Yeah

05:18.602 --> 05:19.617
Have you seen?
- Yes

05:19.618 --> 05:21.416
This is exactly what they did

05:21.778 --> 05:25.476
So you can watch porn or whatever.
And do not use it just for that...

05:25.678 --> 05:27.238
I also won $ 200
this weekend.

05:27.239 --> 05:30.444
Would you please finish that
before I lose the bus?

05:30.725 --> 05:32.705
You've smoked too much and this will give
.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.501
What?

05:34.657 --> 05:36.242
We're running out of food.

05:36.571 --> 05:37.571
You...

05:38.476 --> 05:41.148
You should get well...

05:41.751 --> 05:44.271
Look, you're covered in crumbs
of "cheese puft". - It's okay.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.144
You look like you've been in a snowball
made of "Cheese puft"

05:47.583 --> 05:49.233
How you've been in a radioactive
cheese course

05:49.245 --> 05:50.729
And you'd
become a snowman...

05:50.946 --> 05:52.236
And you raised your hand and tell
and the

05:52.248 --> 05:53.676
People  "Hello World"
Is that what you want?

05:53.917 --> 05:57.708
Guys, you two children,
Have you had sex in her life?

05:58.933 --> 06:03.068
Well, I think...
I will stay here and not go into conclusions.

06:03.352 --> 06:06.281
Speak for yourself, "Redtube".
Am I right, Lev?

06:08.263 --> 06:13.704
Sorry, I will not comment on that question,
but... I really do not see the point.

06:13.986 --> 06:14.986
She does not see her point.

06:17.558 --> 06:20.760
Okay, that's really sweet of you.

06:24.998 --> 06:27.718
I can not believe we're going to
the univerdidad in a few months.

06:28.183 --> 06:35.657
You do not have to worry about that, this is
real, I know, let's just enjoy it.

06:37.182 --> 06:38.182
You promise?

06:39.460 --> 06:42.461
Actually  "promise"
is the perfect word.

06:44.787 --> 06:46.846
No, no, no, no.
Do not think that is the thing....

06:47.220 --> 06:48.931
This is not a proposition.

06:49.453 --> 06:51.291
This is a promise ring.

06:51.899 --> 06:52.899
Y...

06:53.103 --> 06:55.176
I'm going to feel stupid, but...

06:56.722 --> 06:59.019
I really want you to know that I love you.

06:59.661 --> 07:02.194
And I promise that I will always choose love
.

07:16.184 --> 07:19.568
So, do not I have to worry
of the other girls in school?

07:22.251 --> 07:24.115
Someday this will be a proposition.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.965
So you will not have anything to worry
.

07:29.776 --> 07:30.776
I hope so.

07:37.018 --> 07:39.684
Do you know that would make this better?
- Chelsea.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.198
Look, I know you feel you know

07:43.210 --> 07:46.003
Same, but really want my first time
.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.715
Our first time, it
on our wedding night.

07:51.058 --> 07:52.185
I know.

07:52.798 --> 07:53.798

07:54.238 --> 07:59.622
Hey, when you finally do this, how
husband and wife, that moment will...

08:00.168 --> 08:03.365
The most beautiful and best
we have ever spent together.

What you will see?

08:10.961 --> 08:11.961
Yes.

08:13.068 --> 08:14.068
What I can see.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.570
Hey, "D"!

08:17.328 --> 08:19.012
"D", where the fuck are you, man ?!

08:21.232 --> 08:22.232
Hey...

08:22.417 --> 08:23.417
Hey, are you okay?

08:24.152 --> 08:27.163
Yes, I just felt for a moment...

08:28.104 --> 08:30.458
How it was going down.

08:32.639 --> 08:34.573
Okay. All right.

08:39.677 --> 08:40.948
Here I am and I do not think so...

08:41.613 --> 08:43.657
I know, I am a virgin...

08:43.658 --> 08:45.330
Fuck.
- Oh my God.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.726
Man, we returned.

08:48.635 --> 08:49.635
Extrañastes us?

08:49.884 --> 08:52.083
Much . More than you think.

08:52.084 --> 08:53.616
I know, I know.

08:55.232 --> 08:56.232
Oh, thanks.

08:57.143 --> 09:00.368
Well, met everyone,
why I had this dream.

09:00.369 --> 09:02.106
Oh, that's great, Steve.

09:02.777 --> 09:03.576
This is important.

09:03.801 --> 09:07.347
This is the most epic
dreams I've had in my life.

09:07.644 --> 09:12.633
It's about this woman, she has red hair
, she was dressed in white...

09:13.029 --> 09:15.770
She had tits...
- Hey!

09:16.719 --> 09:19.973
Nena, is just a dream you should not worry
. - It's okay.

09:20.348 --> 09:22.331
This woman is back in the game
.

09:22.617 --> 09:26.541
She stands before a spooky door...

09:26.993 --> 09:29.633
And she's like a vampire
or something.

09:29.634 --> 09:32.597
She had that white veil,
but I could not see his face, but...

09:32.598 --> 09:34.973
But if you could see him clearly
tits.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.376
She led me to the forest...

09:37.622 --> 09:40.305
And suddenly
I had that burning of a castle image.

09:40.306 --> 09:44.801
This woman called me and told me
"Bring me the circle of seven".

09:45.297 --> 09:46.639
That's a good accent, right?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.653
I can not!
I can not forget this dream!

09:49.314 --> 09:50.859
I wrote in "Google" castle...

09:51.140 --> 09:52.540
And is called "stone castle".

09:52.612 --> 09:54.515
In small words
"Devil's Castle"

09:55.045 --> 09:58.618
The castle of my dream is in the middle of Transylvania
.

09:59.258 --> 10:00.258
Transylvania?

10:00.322 --> 10:02.383
"Transil-damn-vania" man.
I'm not lying.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.468
This castle is now the castle
Vlad "The Impaler"

10:06.890 --> 10:09.142
Vlad "The Impaler", which dominated the entire Romania...

10:09.376 --> 10:13.268
The old Dracula fangs large
, you know.

10:13.877 --> 10:19.493
Ah, as "Wikepedia"
Castle Dracula's Castle Bram Stoker...

10:19.494 --> 10:22.457
Which is located in the mountains
of the Carpathians in Transylvania...

10:22.458 --> 10:23.727
..and There.

10:23.728 --> 10:26.810
I do not speak of that expedition
shit Bram Stoker.

10:26.811 --> 10:28.568
I'm talking about the real castle.

10:28.804 --> 10:31.127
Del  true.
The one I have to define...

10:31.128 --> 10:32.657
Go to location.

10:34.169 --> 10:35.405
Okay, listen guys...

10:35.637 --> 10:39.381

10:41.229 --> 10:43.389

10:43.981 --> 10:46.981
You know ?, because my birthday boy
Thursday next week, and I love the guy.

10:48.079 --> 10:49.054
And everything will merge.

10:49.055 --> 10:51.825
"D", your family has a history
in Transylvania, right?

10:52.481 --> 10:55.180
Yes, but all the families
come from somewhere.

10:56.591 --> 10:57.591
You know?

10:57.723 --> 10:59.223
I thought I was going to move this.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.422
Whatever, yo ..!

11:06.103 --> 11:09.709
I rented the castle for a week, so start
pack, guys.

11:10.007 --> 11:12.625
Wait, Transylvania?
Why there?

11:13.171 --> 11:16.590
I mean we can go to any part
. Why do not we go to Rome or Paris?

11:16.794 --> 11:17.794
Yes - Not prohibited

11:18.013 --> 11:19.091
I want to go to Paris.

11:19.392 --> 11:22.326
You. Can go to Rome or Paris
whenever they want, you know.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.227
Always we talked about doing something different.

11:25.460 --> 11:26.109
Right?

11:26.318 --> 11:28.892
Let's do something different.
This is the opportunity.

11:28.893 --> 11:30.024
Do you know?

11:30.677 --> 11:32.486
It not even matters.

11:32.845 --> 11:35.391
Why I can pay for my trip.
I pay myself...

11:35.811 --> 11:39.408
So they will pay you. - Why?
- And there will be no issue. - Why not?

11:42.178 --> 11:45.158
Do you want us to travel to Castle Dracula
?

11:45.361 --> 11:47.628
What if the girl
Once your dream, baby?

11:48.951 --> 11:51.496
Baby, I see that girl every day.

11:51.764 --> 11:53.669
Oh, yes! Oh yeah!
Shut!

11:54.468 --> 11:56.512
I mean... If the castle is far and

11:56.524 --> 11:58.671
Celulales phones are not covered...

11:58.672 --> 12:02.084
Where there are nomadic or we freeze us
amid Transylvania, you know?

12:03.146 --> 12:07.235
Do not want you...
- Maybe we can smoke marijuana.

12:07.621 --> 12:08.887
Marijuana Damn!

12:10.384 --> 12:12.318

12:18.142 --> 12:20.587
Hey, what kind of food they serve there?

12:21.803 --> 12:23.474
Greg, you eat everything.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.818
Well, but I have a delicate palate
, okay?

12:25.819 --> 12:28.259
I have to prepare my body for whatever
I go to eat.

12:28.657 --> 12:29.657
Potatoes?

12:31.218 --> 12:34.450
This girl never seen anything. - Hears!
- You move your ass on stage.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.822
Guys?

12:36.365 --> 12:37.365
Nena?

12:41.682 --> 12:46.222
Okay, but only if there
water and electricity.

12:46.493 --> 12:48.719
Yes, then we agree.

12:50.205 --> 12:51.805
Let's do a damn time.
Let's do!

12:52.419 --> 12:54.118
Yes! Let's do! Yes!
- Very good!

12:54.460 --> 12:55.460
Let's celebrate!

12:56.228 --> 12:58.880

12:59.161 --> 13:01.076
Toast in plastic cups.
- Oh, hell.

13:03.142 --> 13:05.509
Yes! - Yes very good!

13:06.322 --> 13:08.456
What you are going to get in Romania?

13:08.457 --> 13:10.618
Clothes, clothes. Only clothing.

13:10.619 --> 13:12.648
If I do not know what we eat,
not you know you're going to wear.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.742
Skirts. Only skirts and suits.

13:18.059 --> 13:19.464
Toast! - Toast!

13:19.857 --> 13:21.693
Transylvania! - Transylvania!

13:23.111 --> 13:24.748

I feel this...!

13:24.749 --> 13:26.173
Stinks.

13:27.006 --> 13:30.197
No we do more than complain
since we left LA

13:30.939 --> 13:32.765
"The last 48 hours...

13:33.062 --> 13:35.121
this was not the case last year"

13:35.449 --> 13:37.603
You're bothering, Traci!
Stop talking!

13:38.090 --> 13:39.630
Are you trying to get back all crazy?

13:39.631 --> 13:40.631
Why not?

13:41.055 --> 13:42.927
I have not seen you've rented a car
.

13:43.566 --> 13:45.706
I told them you can not go to the castle by car
.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.436
Besides, this is true.

13:47.437 --> 13:48.437
Authentic?

13:48.857 --> 13:49.857
Yes.

13:50.043 --> 13:51.156
This is true.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.603
The only way to Transylvania.

13:54.046 --> 13:56.717
The real castle is great.
There's just some "failures".

13:56.718 --> 13:58.524
Wait, "failure"?

13:59.385 --> 14:00.708
Yes, "failures".

14:01.101 --> 14:02.101
Do you want to explain?

14:04.195 --> 14:06.392
No electricity, no.

14:06.726 --> 14:08.611
Finally
only you find a "safe".

14:08.847 --> 14:11.471
That was my only request!

14:11.954 --> 14:14.008
I need electricity!

14:14.884 --> 14:17.044
I did not tell the truth because
maybe you would not have come.

14:17.143 --> 14:18.813
So, sorry.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.778
I feel so miserable.

14:20.779 --> 14:23.309
There have another misarable!

14:32.775 --> 14:33.800
Damn, man.

14:34.375 --> 14:38.926
A phone with an international plan and a unit
3 gigs and it's a piece of shit.

14:39.425 --> 14:40.425
Oh, my God.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.773
Missing  5 for end party
week and "Puff"

14:43.987 --> 14:44.829
Really?

14:44.830 --> 14:48.377
Perhaps in the city does not allow us that.
It does not always mean that.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.175
's Fine with me do the right thing.

14:51.176 --> 14:53.096
Sorry, Do you mind if I have
a couple of ladies?

14:53.379 --> 14:55.603
Can you tell me the difference between
"pomp" or "soleto"?

14:55.873 --> 14:56.704
I can not.

14:56.705 --> 14:59.943
This couple of girls took me fifteen hundred dollars
by this weekend...

15:00.209 --> 15:01.165
And I just have this opportunity.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.923
And if  "Pomp" or whatever,
"redneck", it cost me money.

15:04.911 --> 15:08.285
Cost me money, blah, blah!
Give me the shoe, blah, blah, blah!

15:09.106 --> 15:10.559
Oh, take it or not.

15:10.778 --> 15:13.392
Ah, how do you manage to climb up there as a
pomper?

15:13.393 --> 15:17.483
I climbed up here with dexterity, agility and much
Carazon.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.053
Stay there, I'll work on that.

15:19.651 --> 15:21.091
And you need a ladder to get down?
- Than?

15:21.306 --> 15:22.655
Do you need a ladder?
- I do not need a ladder!

15:22.656 --> 15:24.616
You need a ladder.
- I need power and courage.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.334
A little slut with a lot of courage.
I'll be fine.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.537
Dominic.

15:59.002 --> 16:00.002
What now?

16:01.843 --> 16:04.203
Please tell me you do not have to walk
anyway.

16:05.515 --> 16:07.810
What am I doing here?

16:13.079 --> 16:14.079
- "D"
- Yes

16:14.436 --> 16:15.436
Can you...?

16:15.903 --> 16:18.623
Can you keep it? It hurts me.
You'll have to change it for another size.

16:18.747 --> 16:19.747
Okay.

16:20.268 --> 16:21.368
Yes, sure.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.982

- Yes

16:30.667 --> 16:33.860
The dream you had,
How was the door?

16:34.717 --> 16:40.260
It was a really big, with a corridor
almost could not enter size.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.879
Why are we whispering?

16:44.134 --> 16:48.542
I had the same dream on the train and
heard a woman calling my name.

16:49.388 --> 16:50.435
Lie.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.775
Really?
- Yes really.

16:54.746 --> 16:56.254
I do not know, I do not say.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.011
Greetings, greetings.

16:58.522 --> 16:59.665
I believe you are the guide.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.267
Yes, you can call me André.

17:02.832 --> 17:05.045
Where is your car?
- Where is the car? - I do not have a car.

17:05.046 --> 17:07.893
I told them we can not go by car, is a short walk
.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.452
She arrived two hours late.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.898
Half now and half when we get

17:17.968 --> 17:19.232
Okay, follow me.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.708

17:54.791 --> 17:56.117
Oh, "D"!

17:56.118 --> 17:58.806
She is under... - You okay.

18:04.728 --> 18:06.227
Aww! Damn!

18:10.051 --> 18:11.754
Oh, look, we're moving forward.

18:24.084 --> 18:25.084
Unbelievable.

18:34.118 --> 18:35.118
I mean....

18:35.257 --> 18:38.817
It's nice. It is somewhat rustic.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.317
Money. - Than?

18:41.626 --> 18:42.717
Money.

18:43.682 --> 18:45.109

18:45.352 --> 18:47.494
This bag has enough food for two days.

18:47.883 --> 18:49.531
I turned, I'm going now.

18:49.957 --> 18:51.437
The keys have the staff?

18:51.921 --> 18:54.049
Keys? -Yes.

19:29.193 --> 19:30.193
That's right.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.333
What ?!
- Okay...

19:31.707 --> 19:33.833
I understand that this is not a five-star hotel
...

19:34.065 --> 19:38.673
But at least I expected a star
for food and basic needs.

19:38.674 --> 19:38.905
Yes.

19:39.236 --> 19:42.352
Yes, Adam, she will need to give him back every
cents per day here...

19:42.353 --> 19:43.805

19:44.803 --> 19:47.924

- At the castle.

20:04.089 --> 20:07.026
Oh, it looks good.

20:10.566 --> 20:12.823
Oh, my God. Nothing shows.

20:14.751 --> 20:16.248
I not see the entrance.

20:24.603 --> 20:26.137

Who are you?

20:37.943 --> 20:38.943

You must be Adam?

20:41.565 --> 20:43.846
No, no, no.
It not supposed to have anyone in the castle.

20:44.140 --> 20:48.172
André, the man who brought the leaves
I scare everyone he brings here.

20:49.445 --> 20:50.914
This does not happen often.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.699
What the hell is going on here?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.761
This is an old castle...

20:55.067 --> 20:57.301
And as you can see the gate works.

20:58.441 --> 20:59.970
Now is an old gate.

21:00.696 --> 21:02.146
Who are you exactly?

21:05.815 --> 21:07.766
Veronica, that I said.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.586
I have been looking after the castle
since she was a child.

21:12.459 --> 21:14.487
I'll take care of you while you're here
.

21:15.382 --> 21:18.142

Oh?

21:40.330 --> 21:41.766

21:50.642 --> 21:51.642
This is ridiculous!

21:51.925 --> 21:53.685
I can not find a plug
anywhere.

21:53.917 --> 21:56.230
It Is that really there is no electricity here, baby.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.708
There are candles and chandeliers everywhere.

21:59.241 --> 22:00.986
I can not live like this, okay?

22:01.302 --> 22:04.574
I mean
my hair is delicate and needs treatment.

22:05.526 --> 22:06.760
Do you really this is a joke?

22:08.322 --> 22:10.362
What about the gruesome
lady of this castle?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.099
"She's old."

22:12.502 --> 22:14.981
"I will pretenderte where you're"

22:15.187 --> 22:16.747
Maybe she intended us...

22:16.914 --> 22:18.526
O pretenderte she wants you.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.461
Why pretenderte if she is...
- Baby...

22:20.462 --> 22:23.336
"That we shall you live" Come on!

22:24.476 --> 22:27.307
Look, I love you, but you're being ridiculous here
.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.267
Sorry.

22:33.658 --> 22:35.298
I think you're not interested in that.

23:02.577 --> 23:04.942
Nena. - Nene.
- Hello.

23:17.417 --> 23:18.417
Wait...

23:19.084 --> 23:23.344
Do you understand that all I did was turn
through the castle?

23:24.876 --> 23:26.862
Well, a castle would be good.

23:27.747 --> 23:29.162
Or a mansion.

23:31.481 --> 23:33.900
O
any bigger than your condo thing.

23:34.399 --> 23:35.399
Okay.

- Yes

24:05.922 --> 24:06.922
Do not.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.803
I promise, I will not be long.

24:09.050 --> 24:13.484
All you have to do is move my finger
and make money.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.713
I promise it will only take me two seconds and return
...

24:16.993 --> 24:19.990
You know? Do not worry, maybe
not want to play again!

24:19.991 --> 24:21.409
Wait...

Okay...

24:39.392 --> 24:41.592

calls in the room?

24:42.309 --> 24:44.281

ate all our food!

27:06.980 --> 27:08.299
Jesus... - What the hell, Greg?

27:08.753 --> 27:10.578
The basic thing is that we have no food
to start, thanks for that.

27:10.842 --> 27:11.989
Look, everything is fine.

27:12.545 --> 27:15.638
We eat tonight and tomorrow
go for more. Who cares?

27:16.257 --> 27:17.257

Mm-Mm.

27:24.986 --> 27:25.986
Jesus!

It Is that nobody can stand
without scaring people?

27:29.465 --> 27:30.661
Dinner is ready.

27:31.089 --> 27:33.942
I would take my food bag,
before your fat friend's find.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.187

27:46.077 --> 27:47.263
Even if there is danger.

27:47.528 --> 27:48.835
Do you want to stop that, guys?

27:49.060 --> 27:50.689
We're just going to eat something fresh.

27:51.407 --> 27:52.407
Are you sure?
- Yes

27:55.122 --> 27:56.909
This is a bit romantic.

27:57.284 --> 28:01.106

castle, but with these candles, the moon.

28:01.718 --> 28:03.902
The dinner was quite good.

28:04.167 --> 28:06.709
Everything was delicious.
Thank you, Veronica.

28:08.499 --> 28:09.579
Oh, after this meal.

28:11.930 --> 28:13.350
This line is a killer.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.347
This is very old.

28:17.453 --> 28:19.711
Veronica, what do you know about things
Dracula?

28:22.321 --> 28:24.033
His real name was "Vlad the 3rd"

28:24.753 --> 28:28.498
Was a powerful ruler, who saved
this nation for many years.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.434
About his brutal tendencies?

28:32.850 --> 28:35.087
All these are stories to scare children
.

28:36.585 --> 28:38.986
Like this... "The legend of Count Dracula."

28:40.534 --> 28:41.534
Some pieces.

28:42.317 --> 28:43.317
It was not a magician.

28:44.143 --> 28:52.143
Seriously, folks, as in real history behind
is a king, a vampire, you know?

28:53.201 --> 28:54.201
He died.

28:55.397 --> 28:56.397
That's all.

28:59.228 --> 29:00.228
Okay.

29:00.468 --> 29:03.869
Speaking of all, I found this book in the old bookstore
...

29:04.809 --> 29:08.555
And I think that is the diary of Vlad,
but I want to do a translation.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.012
This is a very important book.

29:13.721 --> 29:16.012
This is the story of
"The Order of the Dragon"

29:16.697 --> 29:18.473
Where Prince Vlad was a member.

29:19.490 --> 29:22.749
If you let me read it, we
to be in a more comfortable place.

29:24.924 --> 29:25.939
Very good place.

29:27.109 --> 29:28.699
Better than a tent in the mountains.

29:29.059 --> 29:32.145
Well, it's not a school year
we can dodge, but...

29:32.377 --> 29:33.968
Learn old things... - Yes!

29:34.656 --> 29:35.897
All the old things.

29:36.365 --> 29:37.365
Ancient  * *

29:37.791 --> 29:39.882
I have not had a damn signal
all night.

29:40.194 --> 29:45.888
Oh my God, he thinks, are in the midst
Romania, in the castle of a friend...

29:45.889 --> 29:48.567
So please,
Do you want to leave the phone for a second?

29:48.778 --> 29:50.870
I know I'm in the middle of Romania
with my friends, but...

29:50.871 --> 29:54.721
I need this second
and I hope that you understand that for a second...

29:55.036 --> 29:59.513
Malditas apologies! I understand
bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla.

29:59.759 --> 30:01.679
Come on, guys!
Do you want to shut up for a second?

30:01.808 --> 30:03.728
Just for a second, come on!
Please continue!

30:04.101 --> 30:07.530
This is the story of
"Sociestas Draconi tarragon"

30:08.167 --> 30:11.458
Who its seal symbolizes the sacrifices

30:11.470 --> 30:14.924
Night
who changed his life for another life.

30:16.734 --> 30:21.469
In ancient Valagia regions, are mentioned
Count words...

30:22.256 --> 30:26.514
And faced with his whole being
against the enemies of his empire.

30:27.453 --> 30:30.976
The prince Vlad did...
- Wait! Shit, sorry, I'll shut up.

30:31.254 --> 30:33.784
Adam!
- I'm sorry, it's fascinating!

30:34.315 --> 30:36.627
Oh, my God!
It's good, really, but...

30:36.936 --> 30:40.881
What we really want to hear is about... How
of Vlad Dracula became?

30:40.882 --> 30:42.442
You are so gross!
I apologize!

30:42.643 --> 30:43.868
Am I right, Greg?

30:44.181 --> 30:45.755
I'm with him.
- In fact, I'm with him.

30:45.756 --> 30:47.866
You should apologize for being so stupid
for that!

30:54.325 --> 30:57.499
Only two moons in the third reign, the

30:57.511 --> 31:00.889
Prince Vlad
returned home after the battle...

31:01.112 --> 31:04.634
And found his castle surrounded
Turkish soldiers ejécito.

31:04.903 --> 31:08.333
The castle was all full of red
blood of his servants...

31:08.543 --> 31:10.924
Soldiers and their families.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.984
I invoke, master of darkness.

31:44.624 --> 31:46.454
I renounce the one true God.

31:46.799 --> 31:50.303
My soul for her life.

31:51.554 --> 31:54.690
My soul to death.

31:56.345 --> 31:59.368
You shall offer me a soul longing...

31:59.369 --> 32:04.520
For a soul to be tortured...

32:05.155 --> 32:08.712
The circle of the seven
demons for eternity?

32:10.400 --> 32:15.132
She lives. They die.
That's the covenant.

32:16.616 --> 32:18.543
Is done.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.695
Drink the blood of your enemy.

32:50.931 --> 32:54.030
Do you hear?
The death of your brothers?

32:54.482 --> 32:56.733
Not even your master may
break our defenses!

32:57.821 --> 33:01.476
No one will see you cringe when you feel fear!

33:10.755 --> 33:11.474
My lord...

33:11.475 --> 33:12.633
You arrived.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.353
No!

33:24.691 --> 33:25.183
No!

33:25.566 --> 33:26.566
No!

33:29.968 --> 33:32.096
What did I do to deserve this?

34:11.262 --> 34:12.915
You promised!

34:13.842 --> 34:14.873
The pact!

34:27.351 --> 34:28.351
My beloved...

34:28.687 --> 34:29.735
My lord!

34:41.422 --> 34:43.150
Take this, my love!

34:45.235 --> 34:46.378
Back...

34:47.362 --> 34:49.346
On the day of the wolf!

34:49.623 --> 34:51.559
Prepare the way!

35:05.337 --> 35:05.933
Oh, God!

35:06.242 --> 35:08.395
Fucking bastard!
Jesus, Adam!

35:08.612 --> 35:10.259
Is that all?
Is that the whole story?

35:10.787 --> 35:11.787
Yes.

35:12.226 --> 35:13.786
The rest of the pages are blank
.

35:14.021 --> 35:17.189
All I could say
Elisabeta of this castle.

35:17.501 --> 35:20.633
You.
Heard the last writings of "The Order of the Dragon"

35:21.188 --> 35:23.319
So I do not think this book
how historic.

35:33.621 --> 35:35.150
I'll go get a glass of water.

35:36.695 --> 35:41.411
I'll walk, not good
walk by these walls at night, alone.

35:50.504 --> 35:51.987
You are different from your friends.

36:17.448 --> 36:18.448
Wake.

36:19.367 --> 36:20.367
Wake.

36:24.717 --> 36:26.307
What, what?
That beautiful?

36:26.308 --> 36:26.813
Yes.

36:27.254 --> 36:29.871
She spoke of children who cut her throat
...

36:30.075 --> 36:32.976
People who sell their souls and people
twist their necks.

36:32.977 --> 36:35.258
What's so beautiful?
What are beautiful that?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.504
Oh, my God!
Of course, it had to be Greg!

36:38.156 --> 36:39.266
Yes! You or you!

36:39.267 --> 36:43.045
He loved her more than you can protect us
.

36:43.377 --> 36:44.377
Hello!

36:44.738 --> 36:48.025
Hey, you fell, but do not hurt yourself.

36:49.947 --> 36:52.654
Here, drink a glass of water.
- I'm not well.

36:54.768 --> 36:55.945
In fact I...

36:58.647 --> 36:59.846
Were completed.
Oh man.

37:00.783 --> 37:03.655
There a doctor in the village.
I can take him tomorrow.

37:04.277 --> 37:05.277
Thanks.

37:08.587 --> 37:09.601
I'm sorry for that.

37:10.351 --> 37:11.376
That happens to me sometimes.

37:15.396 --> 37:16.563
Well, strange people.

37:16.564 --> 37:17.564
Me too.

37:17.565 --> 37:21.151
No. You do not want to dig
is aptitid beautifully, you are not like them...

37:21.382 --> 37:23.761
Because someone will reap in the way Greg decides.

37:25.378 --> 37:26.378
Thanks.

37:28.716 --> 37:31.077
She will help me with my "door"
Did you see?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.429
Well, I'm tired all tonight.

37:38.939 --> 37:40.517
What's wrong?

37:41.553 --> 37:43.552
No one will leave the castle walls.

37:44.844 --> 37:47.721
Wolves have very poor fitness
here.

37:50.643 --> 37:55.646
Well, if you need someone to protect
, tell me and go to your room.

37:56.025 --> 37:57.159
Okay, "Casanova".

37:57.423 --> 37:59.064
Do you really think move out here, Adam?

37:59.394 --> 38:01.125
Why... - Good evening everyone.

38:01.611 --> 38:03.458
Good night!
- Good night, Veronica!

38:03.459 --> 38:04.950
This type still hungry!

38:05.374 --> 38:06.837
So I do something about it.

38:06.838 --> 38:07.887
Now is not food.

38:07.888 --> 38:09.380
No matter, find her!

38:14.054 --> 38:15.381
What the fuck, man?

38:20.492 --> 38:21.492
What?

38:21.771 --> 38:22.905
It's just...

38:23.173 --> 38:25.181
I can not receive any signal
of this piece of crap and...

38:25.182 --> 38:27.668
Put that damn thing, sit back and enjoy

38:27.680 --> 38:30.233
Of the evening for two seconds
damn, man!

38:30.581 --> 38:31.283
I will do this.

38:31.546 --> 38:33.362
Sit down or get out of here!

38:33.997 --> 38:34.684
One or the other?

38:34.936 --> 38:36.428
Okay, I'll go.

38:37.851 --> 38:39.180
Really?

38:39.553 --> 38:40.960
Are you kidding?
- Do not!

38:42.831 --> 38:45.101
Sorry guys, I ask
apologize for this...

38:45.113 --> 38:47.243
Bastard!
I think I better go to bed.

38:50.727 --> 38:52.535
Yes. Would you also go?

40:28.447 --> 40:29.603
Can I ask you a question?

40:30.585 --> 40:31.585
Security.

40:32.113 --> 40:34.374
Why it takes so long to go to fetch water
?

40:36.183 --> 40:38.018
I got lost and I fainted.

40:38.605 --> 40:41.723
How Veronica right there?
- If, with Veronica there!

40:43.271 --> 40:46.578
I do not know what you're thinking, but you know better
all about me!

40:47.654 --> 40:49.012
I just...

40:49.543 --> 40:51.543
It really annoys me with those feelings.

40:52.586 --> 40:55.278
Some places are just strange.

40:56.569 --> 40:58.207
Is probably something in the castle.

40:59.372 --> 41:00.372
Perhaps.

41:01.278 --> 41:04.489
I just checked that Greg is not in his room
and neither is Sean.

41:04.945 --> 41:07.348
Well, maybe...

41:07.908 --> 41:09.935
Greg is with Veronica.

41:10.153 --> 41:12.405
Perhaps he will become the king of Romania
.

41:16.018 --> 41:17.018
What about Sean?

41:17.307 --> 41:18.507
In dogs landfill.

41:18.676 --> 41:22.113
You heard what he said about Veronica
walking alone in the castle. - Y?

41:23.113 --> 41:25.406
I can not get these hunches.

41:26.915 --> 41:29.850
'll Go with Adam to find Greg.
I only take five minutes.

41:29.851 --> 41:32.771
If we do not find that insurance is
you must be smoking somewhere.

41:32.851 --> 41:34.030
Nene...

41:34.031 --> 41:36.033
Who cares if
're on vacation?

41:36.045 --> 41:38.102
Why do not you go back to bed and enjoy
?

41:38.561 --> 41:39.585
Five minutes.

41:39.883 --> 41:41.683
Back.
I will return quickly.

41:43.197 --> 41:44.197
Good.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.114
Go.

42:05.712 --> 42:06.412
Hi, guys!

42:06.690 --> 42:08.079
Hello!
What's up?

42:09.247 --> 42:10.556
Sean and Greg have not returned.

42:12.429 --> 42:13.462
Yes, what's your point?

42:14.085 --> 42:15.720
Sure you do not want to go for them?

42:16.021 --> 42:19.206
"D" is that you're not getting anything,
but I have things to do...

42:19.407 --> 42:21.102
And things to do.

42:21.311 --> 42:22.624
We will only be five minutes.

42:23.189 --> 42:29.647
I'm sorry, baby.
I'll take that hot bath and I'll be ready for when you return.

42:32.654 --> 42:33.687
You scum "D"

42:34.014 --> 42:36.290
You make my temperature rise, friend.

42:37.510 --> 42:39.195
Let  "D"!
Do not make jokes!

42:39.506 --> 42:42.363
You know what?
You do not always have to be a complete bastard.

42:42.364 --> 42:46.955
Why did you take my personal choices?
- I'm sorry, okay ?, he did not know.

42:47.659 --> 42:51.637
I'm going to start now. Also I will look
those two "stunned" by the castle.

42:52.449 --> 42:55.241
Know estuvistes nervous before, but this sucks...

42:55.242 --> 42:57.401
I will work and...

42:58.002 --> 43:00.405
Adam, there are other things in life!
- Oh, what?

43:04.553 --> 43:05.898
Okay. But we split.

43:06.412 --> 43:08.315
You go to the left and to the right
.

43:08.936 --> 43:09.936
Yes, sure.

43:11.249 --> 43:13.264
And when you finish
'll go right to bed!

43:40.543 --> 43:42.401
God, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

43:43.824 --> 43:46.507
Just I spent to know how you are.

43:47.942 --> 43:50.834
I just... I'm not tired, you know?

43:51.531 --> 43:56.051
Sean has nothing mental,
you only interested in "i phone" or "i pad"

43:56.635 --> 43:59.919
O bets, something immature.

44:01.467 --> 44:04.412
Do I always have to be
knees? Always?

44:05.956 --> 44:08.100
It must be very frustrating
be his girlfriend.

44:08.327 --> 44:09.327
Yes, well...

44:09.682 --> 44:12.737
I Am seeking love and have it in my hands
.

44:13.142 --> 44:14.920
That kills me, I need that.

44:14.921 --> 44:19.018
See the example that Ashley has
all the time. - Oh, hot water.

44:19.019 --> 44:21.821
You can go to all places, shopping...

44:23.966 --> 44:29.859
Every single thing they have friends
I... I have with Sean.

44:32.174 --> 44:33.174
It could be worse.

44:33.687 --> 44:34.980
Really? What would that be like?

44:35.762 --> 44:38.105
You could be with Greg.
- Oh God.

44:40.817 --> 44:42.748
What time is smiling and love.

44:44.529 --> 44:46.016
I really wish I were dead.

44:49.053 --> 44:53.084
If you could change one thing...
Would you?

44:54.717 --> 44:55.949
I...

44:56.729 --> 44:57.933
I think you know.

45:25.853 --> 45:26.853
Adam?

45:40.468 --> 45:42.516
Adam, get out.

46:04.247 --> 46:05.247
Guys?

46:11.532 --> 46:12.659
Damn!

46:14.453 --> 46:15.453
Hey!

46:15.669 --> 46:16.669
Hey!

46:32.048 --> 46:33.300
What happens to that child?

46:33.530 --> 46:34.593
Hi, Sean.

46:35.219 --> 46:37.231
He likes to watch the well
castle.

46:37.667 --> 46:41.629
Well, he took my mobile phone and I
I would like it back, please

46:42.534 --> 46:44.876
You took something that belongs to him?

46:45.231 --> 46:46.776
It's a wonder he wanted to see.

46:47.259 --> 46:51.559
Well, that's steal if you ask me.
You need to return.

46:52.144 --> 46:53.329
But... - Now!

46:54.561 --> 46:55.734
Here.

46:56.013 --> 46:56.847
Oh, what...?

46:56.848 --> 46:59.896
Putting your life and your faith in a machine
how that only you become more vague!

47:00.110 --> 47:01.266
! Just stop!
This is not a game!

47:01.267 --> 47:02.093
Oh, what the hell?

47:02.094 --> 47:05.034
Not wont be a vague
with the being that you love!

47:06.317 --> 47:07.770
Demon disappears.

47:15.201 --> 47:17.841
You and Ashley are the only ones who have not seen their parents
a month.

47:18.575 --> 47:20.964
I have several tricks it is
week if that's what you mean.

47:22.362 --> 47:23.515
Yes, it would be amazing.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.472
What will you do when you let Sean?

47:27.840 --> 47:29.740
I have to fix some things.

47:30.474 --> 47:31.474
Security.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.332
She is sleeping.

47:36.863 --> 47:38.703
This will be our secret, okay?

48:22.715 --> 48:23.715
Whao!

48:44.390 --> 48:45.532
That is very old.

48:46.828 --> 48:51.835
Oh... I'm sorry.
Really do not want...

48:51.836 --> 48:54.381
Losing yourself in my quarters?
- Yes.

48:56.435 --> 49:00.147
They belong to Prince Vlad.
You look like him a little.

49:00.874 --> 49:03.228
Or maybe you llegastes to restore
history?

49:05.471 --> 49:06.843
You can touch me if you want.

49:07.438 --> 49:10.092
I... I'm fine. Thank you.

49:13.166 --> 49:15.612
Well, I'm looking for Sean and Greg.

49:15.613 --> 49:18.053
The big guy and the little guy.

49:18.893 --> 49:19.893
Have you seen them?

49:21.202 --> 49:24.492
But if I do, I'll let you know.

49:25.108 --> 49:26.908
Are you sure you
no friends left?

49:27.508 --> 49:29.827
No, I think they are
locked and secure.

49:32.329 --> 49:33.395
Thanks.

49:51.540 --> 49:52.540
What is happening?

49:53.077 --> 49:55.517
I do not want to be here anymore.
Than?

49:55.854 --> 49:57.810
True... Ghosts.

49:58.039 --> 49:59.618
Something in the bathroom.

50:00.290 --> 50:01.624
Ghosts?
Does that mean?

50:01.828 --> 50:05.046
I do not care if you believe me or not, but I want to go...
now.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.374
Baby, can not leave here.

50:07.624 --> 50:08.935
Did not you hear what Veronica said?

50:09.295 --> 50:11.383
There are wolves out and are very dangerous.

50:11.916 --> 50:12.475
No.

50:12.817 --> 50:14.989
Look, I'll stay with you all night...

50:15.386 --> 50:18.717
And when we are safe by
talk tomorrow, okay?

50:19.278 --> 50:20.278
Good.

50:23.250 --> 50:26.464
Well, since you officially started
this before now...

50:32.061 --> 50:33.061
Sorry.

50:43.164 --> 50:44.669
Hello. - Hello.

50:45.910 --> 50:47.907
I'm sorry I upset before.

50:48.334 --> 50:49.334
Okay.

51:07.753 --> 51:08.753
Dom?

51:14.778 --> 51:15.778
Are you okay?

51:17.160 --> 51:19.687
Dom, if you walked through the front
someone is here.

51:20.462 --> 51:21.462
What?

51:22.457 --> 51:25.033
But if I was just looking
boys.

51:27.452 --> 51:28.470
Was it you?

51:29.215 --> 51:30.835
Yes, relax.

51:31.151 --> 51:33.024
You had said that he would look for.

51:33.753 --> 51:35.941
I do not like this place, Dom

51:36.267 --> 51:39.890
There are voices everywhere
then that bitch is behind you.

51:42.026 --> 51:44.096
I can not stay here a week.

51:47.079 --> 51:48.109
Are you okay?

51:50.554 --> 51:52.055
Yes, it's just...

51:53.008 --> 51:55.703
Is the feeling that began to be stronger
...

51:55.704 --> 51:58.001
About this place and about
the castle.

51:59.224 --> 52:01.562
Perhaps
talk to Adam to see the doctor tomorrow.

52:02.718 --> 52:04.278
Do you know what he is prone to bouts?

52:05.776 --> 52:07.336
You are the one who have to talk.

52:11.333 --> 52:12.658
True, you have to sleep.

52:49.185 --> 52:50.297
It's time.

52:55.737 --> 52:57.299
It's time, my lord.

53:14.774 --> 53:15.851
What is that?

53:17.351 --> 53:18.441
You gotta see this.

53:27.412 --> 53:28.412
Oh, my God!

53:29.133 --> 53:30.613
It looks like Veronica!

53:30.986 --> 53:32.398
What the...?

53:33.549 --> 53:36.667
It is dated 1476 A.D.
- But all we saw it, right?

53:36.868 --> 53:39.995
I mean she's going to be more irrelevant
afternoon some way, but...

53:39.996 --> 53:41.996
This place is weird
must get out of here now!

53:42.196 --> 53:43.400
Someone seen Sean?

53:43.710 --> 53:46.238
He was sleeping with me last night,
but I woke up this morning and...

53:46.239 --> 53:49.000
I do not know, he just was not, perhaps
I have to guess that was!

53:49.455 --> 53:50.622
You have the phone with you, right?

53:50.623 --> 53:51.690
Yes, but I have to look.

53:51.691 --> 53:53.311
How about you?
- Do not! I looked everywhere!

53:54.502 --> 53:55.544
What about Greg?

53:58.583 --> 54:00.004
Damn... Greg !

54:01.749 --> 54:03.013
He's not in here!

54:04.121 --> 54:07.105
Okay, I'll finally listen to that creepy
book...

54:07.679 --> 54:08.679
We go.

54:09.224 --> 54:10.294
Oh, guys!

54:11.928 --> 54:13.288
It is the same that is in the book!

54:13.748 --> 54:15.188
It's exactly like her!

54:15.704 --> 54:17.873
We have to find her and ask her.

54:18.118 --> 54:19.438
Maybe she saw Sean and Greg.

54:19.591 --> 54:20.773
How will you find it?

54:21.553 --> 54:23.193
I know where your room is.
- Than?

54:23.368 --> 54:25.707
Hey, look, I was in his quarters
looking guys, okay?

54:25.708 --> 54:28.948
I had not said anything because I knew you were going to discuss
no reason at me!

54:29.496 --> 54:32.137
We have much bigger than solve problems, are you okay ?!

54:36.545 --> 54:39.772
No! This can not be right!
This is exactly the door!

54:40.242 --> 54:42.118
"D" What's going on?
Why did you lie to us?

54:42.119 --> 54:44.514
I'm not lying! I swear to God!
I was here!

54:45.207 --> 54:46.207
Why you hide it?

54:46.833 --> 54:49.362
I'm not hiding anything, I promise.

55:04.737 --> 55:05.835
No!

55:06.926 --> 55:07.994
No!

55:08.720 --> 55:10.132
Off me, dammit!

55:13.574 --> 55:15.219
Oh, God!
- Quiet.

55:16.085 --> 55:19.097
I'm sorry!
I am so sorry!

55:19.768 --> 55:22.141
Oh, my God!
He died!

55:23.095 --> 55:25.053
Guys, let's go now.

55:25.054 --> 55:27.174
We have to call the police and seek
phone!

55:27.332 --> 55:30.015
The phone has no signal!
Let's go from here!

55:33.866 --> 55:35.392
Whoever did this has to be by

55:35.404 --> 55:37.205
Surroundings.
So let's go from here.

55:37.206 --> 55:39.739
Maybe he shut up!
Veronica told us ..!

55:39.740 --> 55:41.849
You can not believe it!

55:42.514 --> 55:43.682
Sean is dead!

55:45.471 --> 55:49.106
Sean was right, there is something wrong
in this castle! I've seen things!

55:51.104 --> 55:52.104
I saw them in the bathroom!

55:52.454 --> 55:54.214
I... You have to make a decision
okay?

55:54.284 --> 55:57.106
We seek to Greg and we go from here.

55:57.328 --> 55:59.123
But we have to leave the body
here, right?

55:59.124 --> 56:01.285
Okay guys, we go now!
Let's go!

56:02.003 --> 56:03.057
What about Greg?

56:03.268 --> 56:05.348
I do not know, I searched the kitchen
and he was not there!

56:05.569 --> 56:07.129
Is that the only place that you sought?

56:07.455 --> 56:08.855
What you believe what buscastes at all?

56:08.992 --> 56:10.878
What do you say?
What I care a shit?

56:10.879 --> 56:14.562
Not the damn time to fight!
We have to get out of here!

56:16.684 --> 56:20.459
Come here! I'm sorry!
We leave it, okay ?!

56:26.383 --> 56:27.910
Greg!
- Greg!

56:28.226 --> 56:29.226
Greg!

56:29.960 --> 56:30.960
Greg!

56:32.528 --> 56:33.827
Where is he?

56:35.089 --> 56:36.089
Greg!

56:36.362 --> 56:37.476
Guys, wait!

57:13.530 --> 57:14.530
"D"?

57:16.021 --> 57:17.021
"D"!

57:18.633 --> 57:19.633
What's up, man?

57:21.129 --> 57:23.384
He's...

57:25.967 --> 57:28.600
Just close your eyes when
go through the tunnel!

57:30.701 --> 57:31.846
What is happening?

57:33.294 --> 57:34.900
What is happening?

57:46.705 --> 57:48.579
We must get out of this bloody trail.

57:49.026 --> 57:50.171
I know.

57:51.085 --> 57:52.404
Just a second.

57:53.448 --> 57:55.067
I'm sorry, guys.
This is all my fault.

57:55.068 --> 57:56.502
Adam... - Do not say that.

57:56.503 --> 57:58.597
No, no, it's not.
It's not your fault.

57:59.064 --> 58:02.542
Your traiste us here, but not your fault
. Only vamonos.

58:04.316 --> 58:05.316
I...

58:05.719 --> 58:06.719
I remember this hill.

58:07.758 --> 58:11.193
From where you are until this tree
three similar trees.

58:12.223 --> 58:15.862
So we will continue down the road, descend
and try to get help.

58:16.341 --> 58:17.343
Is it okay?
- It's okay.

58:17.670 --> 58:18.696
How important is it?

58:18.697 --> 58:20.551
Guys, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

58:21.097 --> 58:23.204
You'll see how
back to the United States. Come on.

58:23.844 --> 58:24.925
We can achieve this.

58:25.762 --> 58:28.007
Guys, this is!
This is the clear!

58:28.912 --> 58:30.767
No, no, no, no no!
But what...?

58:31.363 --> 58:33.529
What the...?
We went down the hill, right ?!

58:33.982 --> 58:35.152
We walked down the hill!

58:35.695 --> 58:38.255
We follow the path and down the damn hill
, right ?!

58:38.256 --> 58:39.729
Look guys, try something!
I mean...!

58:40.135 --> 58:41.698
Look! Look! Look!

58:41.699 --> 58:43.947
We will mark the trees with this!

58:44.835 --> 58:46.159
Do our own path!

58:46.375 --> 58:48.035
That you show us the way out,
okay?

58:48.036 --> 58:50.490
So let's go.
Come on, follow me.

59:10.270 --> 59:11.357
This is the hill, right?

59:13.205 --> 59:14.540
This is!
So...

59:15.169 --> 59:16.649
We went in that direction.

59:17.050 --> 59:18.833
We not want to go over there.

59:19.314 --> 59:20.794
We have to go this way here.

59:25.740 --> 59:28.357
Take this step and take this damn road.

59:39.456 --> 59:41.266
Come on, almost there.

59:43.852 --> 59:46.224
No, no, wait...
What the...?

59:57.674 --> 59:59.248
What we will achieve.
We are going to achieve.

59:59.467 --> 01:00:00.854
All of this was my fault!

01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:04.165
If only I'd been more patient!
I do not know!

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.821
Levy, Levy.
It's not your fault.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640
Do not touch me...

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.341
Do not touch me!

01:00:11.593 --> 01:00:13.119
Do not touch me!

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.148
You're right!
Was not our fault...

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.704
It was because of you!

01:00:18.626 --> 01:00:19.800
Your traiste us here!

01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:22.404
You killed Greg!
You killed my boyfriend!

01:00:23.682 --> 01:00:25.904
I wanted something new!
I wanted something different...

01:00:25.905 --> 01:00:29.053
And I thought you were going to give me!
But you want to kill us all!

01:00:29.563 --> 01:00:31.392
Levy, Levy, listen...

01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:37.166
I really feel about what happened to him
Greg and Sean, but do not blame Adam...

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.365
He just does what he can.

01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:43.065
Oh! You do not know everything about him!
What do you know?

01:00:43.483 --> 01:00:44.536
Taking gifts from him?

01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:49.052
To you do not give a shit about Ashley
Because you're a damn "bulldozer"

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:52.403
You know what, Levy?
Fuck!

01:00:52.811 --> 01:00:55.473
Guys, if she wants to stay here
Leave her alone!

01:00:55.866 --> 01:00:57.750
I cared about Sean!

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.777
I loved him!

01:00:59.778 --> 01:01:02.245
You do not deserve to Adam!
You do not deserve someone like him!

01:01:02.716 --> 01:01:03.716
Is why...

01:01:04.403 --> 01:01:07.544
When he was not with you...
He came towards me.

01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:11.472
What is she talking about?

01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:12.739
True.

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.589
When we had a good  "fucking"...
He came towards me.

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:20.410
What is she talking about?

01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:25.512
I'm talking about your boyfriend is me
"fucking" to me several weeks ago!

01:01:25.795 --> 01:01:27.515
Why will not you interesas him shit!

01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:30.818
What was that?

01:01:33.044 --> 01:01:33.511
Oh my God!

01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:34.797
Fuck.

01:01:35.898 --> 01:01:36.898
Fuck.

01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:55.835
What the...?
What happened?

01:02:01.596 --> 01:02:03.597
Guys, we need to return to the castle!

01:02:04.126 --> 01:02:06.352
I will not return to the bloody castle!

01:02:06.586 --> 01:02:07.986
Are you going to stay here with the wolves?

01:02:08.245 --> 01:02:09.970
They smell blood!
We have no choice!

01:02:10.834 --> 01:02:12.354
We gotta get the hell out!

01:02:12.408 --> 01:02:13.408
We have to go!

01:02:22.461 --> 01:02:23.726
I'm so tired.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.561
I have to keep my eyes open.

01:02:29.924 --> 01:02:31.324
I have hunger.

01:02:34.826 --> 01:02:37.443
I just want to sleep,
but can not.

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:44.152
Keep them open, but I will try to manternerlos yourself

01:02:45.923 --> 01:02:49.117
We joking
on this piece of trash.

01:02:54.114 --> 01:02:55.592
I just want to leave here.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.072
Rose, shut up!

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:02.140
You have no right to talk like that.
- Just calm down.

01:03:02.141 --> 01:03:07.518
You were "fucking"
that bitch while your two best friends were killed!

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.805
Now you feel fear?

01:03:10.304 --> 01:03:12.301
Do not I'll say it again!
Stop talking!

01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:13.774
I will not stop talking!

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.339
Is that what you wanted?
What were not Greg and Sean?

01:03:17.013 --> 01:03:18.573
I will not believe anything you say.

01:03:19.414 --> 01:03:22.862
You are a "bloodsucking whore"
Did you know?

01:03:23.753 --> 01:03:26.000
You just you spent my money!
That's all you did!

01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:27.934
In this scenario!
In the whole planet earth!

01:03:28.658 --> 01:03:31.923
Would you suck the life to anyone!
And why? Huh?

01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:33.514
Did you expect a special life?

01:03:33.983 --> 01:03:37.178
You're just a
"problematic and wealthy whore"!

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:38.179
Muerete...

01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:41.860
I hope you die a damn time,
pathetic piece of shit!

01:03:42.158 --> 01:03:43.386
Ashley!
- Than?

01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:45.771
We have to stay together!
- I do not care!

01:03:45.804 --> 01:03:51.063
Rather risk that one has outside

01:03:52.064 --> 01:03:54.144
My chances!
Current take me! - Jesus!

01:03:55.811 --> 01:03:57.500
Stay here!
I'll bring it back!

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.101
Sometimes become idiots!
- Dom!

01:04:02.659 --> 01:04:05.082
Do not worry, I'll protect you.

01:04:06.018 --> 01:04:08.157
Ashley, wait!
Ashley!

01:04:30.611 --> 01:04:31.691
Why did you traistes here?

01:04:32.679 --> 01:04:35.156
Just I had the great idea to do something different
.

01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:37.634
It was probably damn different.

01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:41.993
Why?

01:04:43.437 --> 01:04:45.496
Why here?
Did he tell you he wanted to go?

01:04:45.497 --> 01:04:47.676
Will you give me a fucking night?

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:52.398
Good. Like you say.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.422
Are you still a virgin?
It is not like this?

01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:06.003
What do you care?

01:05:06.314 --> 01:05:07.485
I do not care.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:09.020
Okay...

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:16.977
Are you sure you want to stay well?

01:05:17.677 --> 01:05:18.677
Excuse me?

01:05:20.212 --> 01:05:22.594
No... I just said, you know?

01:05:23.198 --> 01:05:24.598
If you want to do so with "D"...

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:26.582
Why not do it with me?

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.336
We will all die
damn anyway!

01:05:39.563 --> 01:05:40.563
How important is it?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.568
What fucking matter?
You have the fucking pleasure.

01:05:47.521 --> 01:05:48.521
Stop.

01:05:49.388 --> 01:05:50.388
Oh, come on.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:52.648
Stop.
- Look...

01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:55.099
Things do not matter
Ashley said, you know?

01:05:55.409 --> 01:05:56.409
Stop.

01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:58.812
Stop.
- Come on.

01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:02.589
Stop!

01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:03.681
Damn!

01:06:05.053 --> 01:06:06.613
Chelsea, come on!
I was just kidding!

01:06:17.595 --> 01:06:19.112
It's time, my love.

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:24.853
It's time.

01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:34.049
Another sacrifice...

01:06:35.966 --> 01:06:38.132
The invadilez not last long.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.241
You will shine stronger than all.

01:06:43.552 --> 01:06:45.369
I waited for long.

01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:48.336
Now I can touch you again, my lord.

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:50.416
I love you.

01:06:51.067 --> 01:06:52.678
I love you.

01:07:08.454 --> 01:07:09.989
Last sacrifices.

01:07:10.948 --> 01:07:12.533
Are you ready?

01:07:13.913 --> 01:07:15.395
For four devils?

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.808
Your hunches be short.

01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:20.289
I feel good, my lord.

01:07:20.888 --> 01:07:22.218

Probably we will not do that.

01:08:37.368 --> 01:08:39.131
You will never leave!

01:08:40.393 --> 01:08:41.393

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.281

The prince hates people
wreak havoc.

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:48.196
Do you know what he says?

01:08:49.372 --> 01:08:51.240
"When you find it do not let go"

01:08:51.723 --> 01:08:54.439
"They can take everything you want your body
"

01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:55.828
I'm thirsty.

01:09:46.861 --> 01:09:48.160
You'd better stay away.

01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:49.584
Look, we have to be united.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.439
Lie!
Get away!

01:09:51.965 --> 01:09:56.476
Sorry, I do not know what I was thinking, is it
well? I did not know what he was doing.

01:09:56.707 --> 01:09:59.582
No! Only you wanted to rape me!

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.449
Chelsea, you're not safe!

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:06.619
Damn!

01:10:19.134 --> 01:10:20.324
Dom... What the...?

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:24.082
Yourself "broke" a son...

01:10:24.363 --> 01:10:27.237
And now you're on your way to hell
enough.

01:10:28.654 --> 01:10:31.200
Put your bones when you go!

01:10:59.499 --> 01:11:00.508
Chelsea?

01:11:04.132 --> 01:11:05.132
Is Dominic.

01:11:06.676 --> 01:11:08.138
Dom, oh yes, Dom.

01:11:13.851 --> 01:11:14.895
Why are you wet?

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:18.214
I know, I know.

01:11:23.818 --> 01:11:25.194
Ashley was killed...

01:11:27.905 --> 01:11:29.410
Why are you calm?

01:11:31.712 --> 01:11:33.396
Please people...

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.473
We're all friends.

01:11:36.515 --> 01:11:37.942
I defected from the faith.

01:11:40.168 --> 01:11:41.417
I know I'm different.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.074
We are pure.

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:46.568
Dom?

01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:48.705
Stop, you're scaring me.

01:11:50.891 --> 01:11:51.891
Dom?

01:13:39.388 --> 01:13:40.388
Dom?

01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:45.799
Why?

01:13:46.513 --> 01:13:47.568
Why are you doing this?

01:13:50.694 --> 01:13:51.694
Poor girl...

01:13:51.906 --> 01:13:56.023
Will die without understanding that life is seditious
boring.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:00.003
Dom... She is not real.

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:05.768
This is exactly...
What she wants to do.

01:14:06.605 --> 01:14:10.023
... This castle is controlling you, okay?

01:14:10.525 --> 01:14:12.678
This is not real.
It's okay?

01:14:13.551 --> 01:14:16.501
Do not make this harder than
what it will be.

01:14:18.462 --> 01:14:20.025
You need to take the road.

01:14:20.896 --> 01:14:21.896
Dom...

01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:23.421
Dom...

01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:26.232
Dom!

01:14:27.561 --> 01:14:30.310
Why do you do it?
Why are you doing this to me?

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.142
That's not you, Dom.

01:14:39.746 --> 01:14:43.536
... Dom Dom, she is controlling you.

01:14:44.492 --> 01:14:46.031
Do not let her do it.

01:14:48.035 --> 01:14:51.467
! Sun! Dom! Dom!

01:14:53.844 --> 01:14:55.738
Okay, Dom...

01:14:56.647 --> 01:14:58.784
You love me.

01:14:58.785 --> 01:14:59.785
Is it okay?

01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:01.735
Eligeme.

01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:03.079
No, my love!

01:15:03.574 --> 01:15:04.701
She does not love you.

01:15:06.173 --> 01:15:09.771
Our love is strong,
how the dark.

01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:14.038
I'm innocent!
I do not deserve to die!

01:15:14.381 --> 01:15:15.553
Innocent?

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:20.001
Innocent? Being next to you
I could see things clearly.

01:15:20.002 --> 01:15:21.541
No! What are you doing?

01:15:22.444 --> 01:15:23.444
Now!

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:29.657
Called  hell and the seven demons...

01:15:30.842 --> 01:15:32.861
To come and be released.

01:15:34.579 --> 01:15:36.065
"Beelzebub" will be the first!

01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:39.528
The carnivorous demon!
Hungry and insatiable!

01:15:40.197 --> 01:15:43.333
The second will be "Belphagor"!
The demon of laziness!

01:15:43.634 --> 01:15:46.690
Who uses people to abide by

01:15:46.702 --> 01:15:49.639
Him with the desires and responsibilities

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:55.635
The third is "Leviathan"
- "Leviathan"!

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:59.344
"The bastard" Bandi "whose heart was corrupt

01:15:59.356 --> 01:16:02.406
for the wishes he had made his brother...

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.890
..and became his brother's wife.

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:11.408
" Mammon "
who emerges from the cries of a heart that never stops...

01:16:11.409 --> 01:16:14.190
Y is hoping to become someone better

01:16:14.876 --> 01:16:19.079

And he was blinded by "Lucifer"

01:16:34.575 --> 01:16:35.465
"Lucifer"

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:38.205
Dom, she is controlling you.

01:17:00.597 --> 01:17:03.012
Seven sacrifices by one.

Seven Sinners by one pure.

01:17:09.285 --> 01:17:10.562
Look at me, Dominic.

01:17:11.222 --> 01:17:12.314

01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:14.578
I'm Chelsea.

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:18.727
Do you remember the nice things we did together
?

01:17:18.728 --> 01:17:20.314
And when you gave me the ring?

01:17:22.462 --> 01:17:23.462
Look at me...

01:17:24.582 --> 01:17:26.524
In this "day of the wolf"...

01:17:27.346 --> 01:17:30.676
All demons arise all over the earth...

01:17:31.016 --> 01:17:33.646
To reduce it to ashes again.

01:17:34.661 --> 01:17:36.993
I invoke, "Lucifer"!

01:17:37.706 --> 01:17:41.590

I waited here in this castle.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:56.342
I was so alone with this punishment...
- Shut up!

01:17:56.552 --> 01:18:00.810
You came to me!
With me!

01:18:05.808 --> 01:18:08.907
Back to me!

01:18:58.568 --> 01:18:59.659
We are dead!

01:18:59.934 --> 01:19:01.362
We have a chance!

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.270
You forgot the true God...

01:19:08.846 --> 01:19:10.518
To be together again.

01:19:11.527 --> 01:19:13.499
You need to come back with me!

01:19:15.271 --> 01:19:16.956

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.045
For hundreds of years...

01:19:35.218 --> 01:19:37.236
For you to return with me.

Please come back to me.

With this blood, I break ties.

With this blood, I return to my worldly form
.

01:20:52.275 --> 01:20:55.750
The last demon.
It's time, my lord!

01:20:57.967 --> 01:20:59.346
Deten  "Satan".

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:03.287
Please liberate his grip.

It's time, my lord.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:11.136
Thou art with me.
