10:29.410 --> 10:31.515
What about pounding the

You've been texting that
college boy all week.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.295

11:12.296 --> 11:14.767
He has playoffs this week. He's anxious.

I don't care if he's
starting point guard

11:16.037 --> 11:17.372

11:17.373 --> 11:19.109
I told you to cut it.

11:19.110 --> 11:22.148
But since I have a daughter who
doesn't respect my wishes,

11:22.149 --> 11:24.554
she gets a father who
doesn't respect hers.

have no place to live,

in an appealing way.

- Yeah.

ahead and use purified water.

our beloved domicile is under
attack from the locals.

reason to take issue with us.

how much these cost?

cock for a living.

52:54.495 --> 52:58.402
Holy shit. Patsy's made,
like, 1,500 tonight.

52:58.403 --> 52:59.505
How'd you do in tips?

52:59.506 --> 53:02.010
- I got two bills.
- Damn!

53:02.011 --> 53:04.282
Hump her on the table, why don't you?

53:06.152 --> 53:08.289
- That doesn't bother you?
- (LAUGHS) Why would it?

53:08.290 --> 53:10.160
We're not dating. We just
hit it every now and then.

53:11.831 --> 53:13.500
Hey, Debs, you're late!

53:13.501 --> 53:15.336
You missed a kick-ass party.

53:15.337 --> 53:17.440
I had a date. Just ended.

53:17.441 --> 53:18.710
A little sexy time?

53:18.711 --> 53:20.514
Not at all.

53:20.515 --> 53:23.452
Did you know that "Jenga" is
the Swahili word for "build"?

53:23.453 --> 53:24.989
Oh, and that Candy Land

53:24.990 --> 53:27.862
was invented by a school
teacher recovering from polio?

53:27.863 --> 53:28.964
I did not.

53:28.965 --> 53:31.035
Exactly. And do you know why?

53:31.036 --> 53:32.972
Because nobody gives a shit.

53:32.973 --> 53:35.811
Is this one of your life-partner folks?

53:35.812 --> 53:38.884
- (SIGHS) I'm starving.
- That food costs money, Debs.

53:38.885 --> 53:40.486
Why am I the only one in the family

53:40.487 --> 53:42.424
you haven't offered a job to?

53:42.425 --> 53:44.529
You'd listen to me? Do what I ask?

53:44.530 --> 53:46.599
Come in when I tell you to?
I'd be your boss.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.436
You'd take orders from me?

53:48.437 --> 53:50.406
No.

53:50.407 --> 53:52.712
Just add it to my tab.
