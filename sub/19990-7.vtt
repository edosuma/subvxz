20:49.865 --> 20:50.664
[groans]

20:50.666 --> 20:52.833
[truck horn blaring]

20:52.835 --> 20:55.302
No-ho-ho!
[tires screeching]

20:55.304 --> 20:56.870
- Reckless drivers.

20:56.872 --> 20:59.840
I loathe reckless drivers.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.609
[indistinct
police radio transmission]

21:02.611 --> 21:06.947
[engine turning, revs]

21:06.949 --> 21:08.849
Pull over, you menace.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.984
- [screams]

21:10.986 --> 21:12.185
[police siren wailing]

21:12.187 --> 21:14.521
Uh, mrs. Puff,
can I have my arms back?

21:14.523 --> 21:16.723
- I said stop your vessel!
- Ooh!

21:16.725 --> 21:18.191
- Sorry, mr. Officer, sir!

21:18.193 --> 21:19.927
I'm applying the brakes!

21:19.929 --> 21:20.794
[engine revs]
oh!

21:20.796 --> 21:24.431
- Ah, we've got us a runner.
[engine revs]

21:24.433 --> 21:26.033
- Pull over, spongebob!

21:26.035 --> 21:27.701
And make it quick.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.637
Look!

21:30.639 --> 21:32.406
- [screams]

21:32.408 --> 21:34.875
[tires screech]
- no!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.276
[crash]

21:36.278 --> 21:37.945
Oh!

21:37.947 --> 21:40.614
[tires screeching]
whoa!

21:40.616 --> 21:43.417
[tires screeching]

21:43.419 --> 21:46.920
[shrieks]

21:46.922 --> 21:48.355
[tires screeching]
spongebob!

21:48.357 --> 21:50.157
Hit the brakes!

21:50.159 --> 21:51.959
- Huh? Oh! Okay.

21:51.961 --> 21:55.696
[tires screeching]

21:59.233 --> 22:01.134
- Goodness gracious.

22:01.136 --> 22:04.304
There isn't a scratch
on this vessel.

22:04.306 --> 22:08.141
Spongebob, the test is history.

22:08.143 --> 22:10.744
You--you've passed!

22:10.746 --> 22:15.082
Here's your license!

22:15.084 --> 22:18.185
And I'm free!
[engine humming]

22:18.187 --> 22:19.086
Ha ha!

22:19.088 --> 22:20.087
[tires screech]

22:20.089 --> 22:22.089
[indistinct
police radio transmission]

22:22.091 --> 22:23.423
- I don't think so.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.093
- Is there a problem,
officer?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.328
[beeping]

22:28.330 --> 22:31.064
- Well, you crossed
the county line

22:31.066 --> 22:31.965
Three miles back.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.267
You, ma'am,
are a parole violator,

22:34.269 --> 22:38.972
Which makes this test
null and void.

22:38.974 --> 22:43.276
I'll take that.

22:44.545 --> 22:48.648
- Spongebob,
I'll get you for this!

22:48.650 --> 22:50.984
I'll get you!
