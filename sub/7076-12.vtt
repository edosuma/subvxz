00:03.953 --> 00:06.316
Hi, Percival!

00:06.317 --> 00:08.292
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:08.293 --> 00:11.879
Happy New Year, you guys.
Do anything fun over break?

00:11.880 --> 00:13.297
Oh, baby Ben got to be
baby Jesus

00:13.298 --> 00:14.798
in our church's nativity play.

00:14.799 --> 00:17.167
Andre was Joseph, and Jordan
was one of the wise men,

00:17.168 --> 00:18.752
and I was in charge of casting.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.671
I digitized
my entire movie collection.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.122
Goodbye, VHS.

00:22.123 --> 00:25.458
Hello, SelectaVision
CED Videodisc.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.261
I'm very psyched
for the new semester.

00:27.262 --> 00:31.112
Or should I say...
Intro to Human Psyched.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.432
The worst.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.818
For our midterm,
we actually get to diagnose

00:34.819 --> 00:36.570
a fellow student
with something.

00:36.571 --> 00:38.305
Don't you do way too much
of that already?

00:38.306 --> 00:40.641
Accusational opposition
disorder.

00:40.642 --> 00:41.992
Hello.

00:41.993 --> 00:43.310
Whoa.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.112
It appears you've all noticed
that my swagger

00:45.113 --> 00:46.113
has a new swagger.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.331
I'll explain.

00:47.332 --> 00:49.032
Over break, I took the plunge

00:49.033 --> 00:50.450
and started seeing
a new shrink.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.752
What? Hello!

00:51.753 --> 00:54.354
Hello. Anyway,
I talked about my dad,

00:54.355 --> 00:55.622
punched a few pillows.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.425
And she put me on this
amazing anti-anxiety pill.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.994
It's really enhanced
my self-confidence.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.346
I explained that really well.

01:02.347 --> 01:05.265
Jeff, you can't be
on anti-anxiety meds.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.718
What little self-doubt you have
is the only thing

01:07.719 --> 01:09.502
keeping your ego penned in.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.039
You are a textbook narcissist.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.174
I'm an exceptional
narcissist, Britta.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.693
Oh, excuse me.

01:16.694 --> 01:18.395
I didn't kill my wife!

01:18.396 --> 01:21.732
I don't care.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.023
Stop that fugitive!

01:30.024 --> 01:31.375
I was wondering
how long it would take

01:31.376 --> 01:32.860
for things to get back
to normal.

01:32.861 --> 01:34.027
Over break, Abed realized
he could hire

01:34.028 --> 01:35.662
celebrity impersonators
from a service

01:35.663 --> 01:37.314
for his own personal use.

01:37.315 --> 01:39.383
He's been doing it...
a lot.

01:39.384 --> 01:40.601
He's not hurting anybody.

01:40.602 --> 01:41.919
He just likes
reenacting scenes from movies.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.670
It's unquestionably awesome.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.088
I question it.
He spent New Year's

01:45.089 --> 01:47.707
locked in our bathroom with
a bad Tom Hanks from cast away.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.009
Abed was the volleyball?

01:49.010 --> 01:50.644
- Well, that makes sense.
- You guys, focus!

01:50.645 --> 01:52.145
Where's he getting the money
for all this?

01:52.146 --> 01:54.231
Intervention.
Intervention. Intervention.

01:54.232 --> 01:56.233
No! You guys need
to stop intervening.

01:56.234 --> 01:58.051
You seriously have a problem.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.487
- I said I didn't kill my wife!
- I still don't care.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.989
Freeze!

02:03.557 --> 02:05.742
Chang, they're just acting!

02:05.743 --> 02:08.288
- Oh. Sorry.
- What was that?

02:08.288 --> 02:11.582
- Somebody call the cops!
- I've got a friend at the zoo.

02:11.583 --> 02:15.235
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

02:15.236 --> 02:18.571
♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

02:18.572 --> 02:21.925
♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪

02:21.926 --> 02:26.046
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:26.047 --> 02:31.018
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

02:31.019 --> 02:35.559

3.12 - Contemporary Impressionists
Sync and correction by Elderfel
www.addic7ed.com

02:40.194 --> 02:42.762
What is this I hear
about a tranquilizer gun?

02:42.763 --> 02:44.615
If you had hit a small student,

02:44.616 --> 02:46.033
they could have died!

02:46.034 --> 02:47.217
I wouldn't do that.

02:47.218 --> 02:48.735
I have a heavy flashlight
for them.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.037
Oh, Ben!

02:50.038 --> 02:53.040
Look, I have to resort
to extreme measures.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.108
I'm a one-man army.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.609
You won't let me have
any guards.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.978
We're broke, Ben!

02:57.979 --> 02:59.680
We now get 80%
of our electricity

02:59.681 --> 03:02.549
from the apartment building
across the street.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.302
Okay...

03:05.303 --> 03:08.005
I don't know who told you
pouting was an option for you,

03:08.006 --> 03:09.806
but all you're making
me feel right now

03:09.807 --> 03:13.844
is hatred of Renee Zellweger.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.730
Look, maybe you can
bring on some students

03:16.731 --> 03:18.148
as security interns.

03:18.149 --> 03:19.433
I'll let you offer them
a credit

03:19.434 --> 03:21.801
in safety or math
or something.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.186
Thank you, sir.

03:23.187 --> 03:25.906
You won't regret this
unless I rise up against you.

03:25.907 --> 03:28.775
I don't know why
I said that. Bye.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.811
Huh! Tah!

03:31.812 --> 03:36.700
Zhou! Zeet! Dah! Toi!

03:37.702 --> 03:40.454
Jeff. Jeff!

03:40.455 --> 03:41.821
I looked it up.
I was right.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.206
Oh, that thing
about Danny Thomas?

03:43.207 --> 03:44.491
I looked it up too.
Weird.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.326
No, those meds you're taking.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.995
Without anxiety to keep
your vanity in check,

03:48.996 --> 03:52.599
you are vulnerable to a syndrome
called hyper-narcissosis.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.135
Okay, look.
This apple is your ego.

03:55.136 --> 03:58.171
Imagine it expanding
to the point of critical mass,

03:58.172 --> 04:00.273
taking over
your whole personality,

04:00.274 --> 04:03.226
making you
an uncontrollable monster.

04:03.227 --> 04:05.312
Britta, how did an apple
make that clear?

04:05.313 --> 04:06.613
Imagine it expanding?

04:06.614 --> 04:08.115
- Use a balloon.
- I was on my way to lunch.

04:08.116 --> 04:09.849
Why are you trying
to take this away from me?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.485
I like having no anxiety.

04:11.486 --> 04:12.619
I'm in harmony with the world.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.154
Looking good, Winger.

04:14.155 --> 04:15.906
Thank you, Leonard,
for that compliment,

04:15.907 --> 04:18.358
and for your service
to this country.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.192
I'm so confident now,
I can pull things off

04:20.194 --> 04:21.661
I never dreamed possible.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.697
Look. Aviators.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.466
Final boarding call,
beefcake airways.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.336
I'm warning you as your friend
to get off of those meds.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.504
And until they're out
of your system,

04:30.505 --> 04:32.372
stay away from
flattering situations...

04:32.373 --> 04:35.542
weddings, soft lighting,
formal wear, gay bars.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.043
And take those off!

04:37.044 --> 04:38.128
Because they make me look good?

04:38.129 --> 04:39.679
That's not relevant.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.681
Ah, welcome back, Jeffrey.
How was your...

04:41.682 --> 04:43.216
Uhh... uhh... unh!

04:44.569 --> 04:46.886
Oh, my God!
Even his shadow!

04:46.887 --> 04:49.022
Look at his shadow!

04:55.062 --> 04:57.030
Security internship available.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.499
Come on, see the world.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.668
Well, you won't see the world,
but come on!

05:02.920 --> 05:05.789
- Hey, Nadir.
- Oh, hey, Vinnie.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.591
Vinnie's the owner
of the doppelgang,

05:07.592 --> 05:08.959
the celebrity impersonator
service I use.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.043
You look familiar.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.129
That's how we all get started
in this racket.

05:12.130 --> 05:13.764
But at a certain point,
if you're smart,

05:13.765 --> 05:16.099
you move up to management
before the gold mine

05:16.100 --> 05:18.418
of resembling French Stewart
runs dry.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.253
- Ah...
- French Stewart...

05:20.254 --> 05:21.638
And speaking of gold mines,

05:21.639 --> 05:23.256
you owe me three grand, pal.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.357
Cool.
Put it on my account.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.143
What do I look like, a sucker?

05:26.144 --> 05:27.427
French Stewart.
But I don't have three grand.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.062
Well, you know what,
you better get it.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.097
Because I'm gonna
tell you something right now...

05:31.098 --> 05:33.433
Holy crap, you'd make
an amazing Seacrest.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.734
Very kind.
Thank you.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.621
You're actually
a lot taller than Seacrest.

05:37.622 --> 05:39.706
You've actually got
a sharper jaw too.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.541
You're actually more handsome
than the guy

05:41.542 --> 05:42.576
that's famous
for being handsome.

05:42.577 --> 05:45.245
Jeff?

05:49.283 --> 05:53.587
You'll be okay.
Just stay humble.

05:53.588 --> 05:55.422
You know what, maybe
there's another option for you.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.424
I've got a big event saturday.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.292
Needs a lot of bodies, huh?

05:59.293 --> 06:01.761
And I see some
high-value faces here.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.762
Got an Oprah.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.264
- Oh!
- And sitting next to her

06:04.265 --> 06:06.483
is a Judy Garland
or an Anne Hathaway.

06:06.484 --> 06:08.101
Add a few extra teeth.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.603
Wow, this is rare.

06:09.604 --> 06:12.772
Both versions
of Michael Jackson.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.940
And you...

06:13.941 --> 06:15.058
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.

06:15.059 --> 06:16.243
- What?
- What?

06:16.244 --> 06:17.244
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.

06:17.245 --> 06:18.245
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

06:18.246 --> 06:20.247
Look, if you guys work
this gig for me

06:20.248 --> 06:22.282
for six hours,
we'll call it even.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.700
Sounds fun.

06:23.701 --> 06:26.152
Abed, Vinnie, can we have
a minute to talk about this?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.754
Sure. Come on, Vinnie. The guy
who makes the fish sticks

06:27.755 --> 06:29.005
looks just like Quincy Jones.

06:29.006 --> 06:30.123
- Get out.
- Seriously.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.374
Guys, I'm sorry,

06:31.375 --> 06:32.959
but this is where
we have to put our foot down.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.261
Well, she has a point.

06:34.262 --> 06:36.463
Next time it'll be $10,000,
and then $20,000,

06:36.464 --> 06:37.797
and then he'll hit rock bottom

06:37.798 --> 06:39.299
and have no one to turn to
but Jesus.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.350
I say we let this play out.

06:40.351 --> 06:41.935
I'd love to help,

06:41.936 --> 06:43.687
but playing Ryan Seacrest
at a big party

06:43.688 --> 06:45.555
may not be a safe
situation for me.

06:45.556 --> 06:47.840
We could actually hurt Abed

06:47.841 --> 06:49.392
if every time he faces reality,

06:49.393 --> 06:51.611
we dress up and play
make-believe to bail him out.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.613
Shame on you people.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.099
It's not our job
to help Abed grow up.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.701
Abed doesn't need reality.

06:57.702 --> 07:00.120
Abed is a magical,
elf-like man

07:00.121 --> 07:01.905
who makes us all more magical

07:01.906 --> 07:03.256
by being near us.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.075
Pierce, who came over
in the middle of the night

07:05.076 --> 07:06.326
that time you forgot how to
fart?

07:06.327 --> 07:07.694
- Abed.
- Shirley...

07:07.695 --> 07:09.045
Who got you a DVD
of Precious,

07:09.046 --> 07:10.747
based on the novel Push,
by Sapphire,

07:10.748 --> 07:13.466
and a copy of the novel Push
autographed by Sapphire?

07:13.467 --> 07:14.834
Abed.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.203
All we had was dumb reality
before we met that man.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.389
And he's made all of our lives
better than reality.

07:19.390 --> 07:20.840
Now it becomes
a little inconvenient,

07:20.841 --> 07:23.176
and it's time to get real?

07:23.177 --> 07:25.312
For shame!

07:25.313 --> 07:28.014
He's right.
Sorry, Troy.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.382
Hey, guys.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.835
Abed, we would be happy
to help you out.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.353
It'll be a good time.

07:33.354 --> 07:35.054
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
- Cool.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.157
- Oprah.
- Oh, thank you.

07:37.158 --> 07:38.408
- See ya, Vin.
- Fat Brando.

07:38.409 --> 07:41.661
- Burt Reynolds.
- Yeah.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.363
Thanks for being flexible.
This'll be fun.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.749
Fun. Yeah, sure.
But here's the deal.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.751
Um, if you guys mess this up,

07:47.752 --> 07:49.953
then his debt is overdue.

07:49.954 --> 07:52.071
And I don't send another bill.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.507
No, I send two guys
that look a lot

07:54.508 --> 07:56.793
like Ving Rhames
and Michael Chiklis.

07:56.794 --> 07:59.245
And they do
a very convincing impression

07:59.246 --> 08:02.515
of breaking your friend's legs.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.602
Their secret is...
They actually break them.

08:13.482 --> 08:14.678
All right, impersonators,

08:14.679 --> 08:17.484
our guest of honor
is one Howie Schwartz,

08:17.485 --> 08:18.446
who,
according to the Talmud,

08:18.447 --> 08:21.116
just became a man.
But I have to say,

08:21.117 --> 08:22.801
I wouldn't want him
next to me in a foxhole.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.570
- Ha!
- Ground rules...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.805
Do stay in your
assigned quadrants

08:26.806 --> 08:28.974
quoting lines from movies
you are positive

08:28.975 --> 08:30.959
that your impersonatee was in.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.227
Do not leave your quadrant,

08:33.229 --> 08:35.462
burp, fart, cough,
hiccup, or cuss.

08:35.464 --> 08:37.631
The obvious exception
being James,

08:37.633 --> 08:38.799
our resident Walter Matthau.

08:38.801 --> 08:40.102
How you doing, Jimmy?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.437
Aw, you give 'em hell.
All right, let's go.

08:42.438 --> 08:46.474
- All my life I has to fight.
- Ready to tangle.

08:46.475 --> 08:48.610
Handsome Seacrest,
I need you in this tux.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.245
Jeff, do not wear that.

08:50.246 --> 08:52.480
Aw, zip it, white Jacko.

08:52.481 --> 08:55.250
Don't worry, that thing
in the cafeteria freaked me out,

08:55.251 --> 08:57.369
so I talked to my shrink,
and she doubled my dosage.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.288
What?
Jeff, that's insane!

08:59.289 --> 09:01.456
I thought so too, but after
I took that extra pill,

09:01.457 --> 09:03.258
it seemed like a great idea.

09:03.259 --> 09:05.844
- Jeff, put it on. Go.
- No, Jeff!

09:05.845 --> 09:07.129
Britta, stop arguing.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.430
If you have anything else
to say,

09:08.431 --> 09:10.382
say it in a high-pitched voice
while walking backwards.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.833
Jeff is in grave danger.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.101
Hee-hee!

09:15.605 --> 09:17.439
Uh, may I help you?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.941
I'm one of the impersonators.

09:19.942 --> 09:24.363
- Which one?
- Do I have to say it?

09:24.364 --> 09:25.981
Burt Reynolds.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.233
Uh, yeah, I don't believe
anybody hired you

09:28.234 --> 09:29.517
to impersonate Burt Reynolds.

09:29.518 --> 09:31.653
- Why not?
- Do I have to say it?

Hmm...

09:48.588 --> 09:50.538
Could be under "fat."

09:50.539 --> 09:53.225
Ah. Oh.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.726
Totally.

09:54.727 --> 09:58.180
Go on in.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.848
Bam.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.983
Abed, get back to your station.

10:01.984 --> 10:03.235
I can't right now,
I'm talking to Geena Davis.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.053
Abed, we have to do this right

10:05.054 --> 10:06.104
or Vinnie won't clear
your debt.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.222
Troy, who cares about money?

10:07.223 --> 10:08.857
Look around.
This is why we're alive.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.360
Ooh, fake Lorenzo Lamas.
Let's go.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.647
I was so sad to hear
of your passing.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.582
Me too.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.286
Sergeant Chang,
what are you doing here?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.372
Hey, Annie.
Just one of the perks

10:23.373 --> 10:24.539
when your brother's a rabbi.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.458
He throws me some
private security gigs

10:26.459 --> 10:28.043
at the events he officiates.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.462
They can get really intense
sometimes.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.915
Can you believe some jerk
brought a scalpel to a bris?

10:33.916 --> 10:35.917
Now smile.

10:35.918 --> 10:38.804
Why is he out of his quadrant?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.924
I'm Lorenzo Lamas.

10:42.925 --> 10:45.127
- He's reenacting a movie.
- Please.

10:45.128 --> 10:46.445
What movie were
Jamie Lee Curtis

10:46.446 --> 10:48.146
and Lorenzo Lamas in together?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.065
See, now I'm just
embarrassed for you

10:50.066 --> 10:52.367
because you've never seen
Lorenzo's Oil.

10:52.368 --> 10:54.986
Lorenzo is an oil tycoon that
gets his address book switched

10:54.987 --> 10:57.605
with Jamie Lee Curtis',

10:57.606 --> 11:00.125
and they give each other
piggyback rides.

did you go to college?

11:02.945 --> 11:05.247

Not all the time.

- that I know better about stuff.
- I don't know if I can do that.

18:07.142 --> 18:08.642

you're gonna have to trust

18:08.643 --> 18:10.845
that you're gonna have
to trust me.

18:13.148 --> 18:17.385
Well, I don't want to stop

19:22.233 --> 19:23.400
I'm a bad person.

19:23.401 --> 19:25.336
What you're feeling
is called shame.

19:25.337 --> 19:26.737
It means you're getting better.

19:26.738 --> 19:30.741
You're gonna be safe again
once those pills wear off.

19:30.742 --> 19:33.928
Um, I was thinking...

19:33.929 --> 19:37.465
You know that person that you
study for your psych class?

19:37.466 --> 19:39.750
Maybe that should be me.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.268
Uh-uh. No way.

19:41.269 --> 19:43.888
You are way out of my league,
diagnostically speaking.

19:43.889 --> 19:46.140
I'm gonna go with someone
a little less complicated.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.258
Like Abed.

There are many advantages

20:18.190 --> 20:20.224
You can drive faster,
change direction.

20:20.225 --> 20:21.926
And the only pee breaks
are yours.

20:21.927 --> 20:26.096
- Are you real?
- Are you?

20:26.097 --> 20:27.231
This is really crazy.

20:27.232 --> 20:28.599
And inaccessible,
and maybe too dark.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.735
Maybe to them,
but not to us.

20:31.736 --> 20:34.822
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
