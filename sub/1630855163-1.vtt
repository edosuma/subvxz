00:58.083 --> 01:01.958
Okay. Tape ID number 703.

01:01.958 --> 01:04.750
Time of day, 6:14 a.m.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.583
Interview with informant resumes.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.125
Please restate the names of these two men.

01:10.833 --> 01:14.375
Hector Álvarez. Adrian Lovell.

01:14.916 --> 01:17.583
- You introduced them?
Yes.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.625
You brokered an arms deal between them?

01:20.250 --> 01:21.416
Yes.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.750
And you were in a relationship
with both of them?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.125
Yes.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.166
All right. Okay.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.375
Help me get the food chain right.

01:33.375 --> 01:36.333
Hector Álvarez was supplying Adrian Lovell
with weapons.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.708
What kind of weapons?

01:39.875 --> 01:41.500
This place isn't secure.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.500
Lady, stop telling us our jobs.
We can take you in if you want.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.916
- You don't know how bad this gets.
Then tell us.

01:59.583 --> 02:01.000
Here.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.250
Look, I get that this is dark,

02:06.375 --> 02:09.291
so why don't we start
with the weapons Álvarez is supplying?

02:12.916 --> 02:14.791
Soviet PKM machine guns,

02:16.083 --> 02:17.791
LAWS rocket launchers,

02:17.791 --> 02:19.541
M18 claymore mines.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.583
It's not the point.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.916
Actually, it is.

02:22.916 --> 02:25.125
They want you dead
for what you know, right?

02:25.875 --> 02:27.208
We need to talk about my deal.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.916
I'm sick of the bridge tournament
this bitch is playing.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.208
If you need our protection--

02:31.208 --> 02:33.750
You wouldn't know
the first thing about protecting me.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.875
Hey. You're safe here.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.708
No, I'm not.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.333
Álvarez is in Cuba,
Lovell's under surveillance.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.208
We've had a tail on him
since the second he landed at O'Hare.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.041
- Then he knows where we are.
Let me tell you--

02:48.041 --> 02:51.625
You think you're following him?
He's following you.

02:51.625 --> 02:54.291
If you think you're gonna dictate
how we conduct an interrogation,

02:54.291 --> 02:56.416
- I don't know who you--

03:05.375 --> 03:06.625
Agents down, shooter outside.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.583
<i>Hawthorne? Carter? Do you copy?</i>

03:10.250 --> 03:12.500
<i>Are we breached? Do you copy?</i>

03:17.833 --> 03:18.708
Come.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.250
- Not the window, don't--

03:41.291 --> 03:42.625
- No, let me get--
- Shh!

04:02.833 --> 04:04.291
Am I gonna die?

04:05.333 --> 04:06.458
I don't know.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
I know you're in there.

04:54.791 --> 04:57.000
Did you think you could hide from me?

04:58.916 --> 05:01.000
You must have known I'd find you.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.375
Adrian.

05:43.791 --> 05:44.916
No.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.583
It's a girl.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.000
Is she okay?

07:04.583 --> 07:06.166
She's perfect.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.500
Gimme the room.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.791
Special Agent Williams.

07:23.875 --> 07:24.833
How are you?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.916
- Where's my baby?
- She's in the nursery.

07:26.916 --> 07:28.458
She was very fortunate.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.916
I wanna see her.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.666
Well, what you want is no longer
the deciding factor in what happens next.

07:34.416 --> 07:37.416
You wasted 12 hours of FBI time
trying to cut a deal for yourself

07:37.416 --> 07:39.125
and seven agents were killed.

07:39.916 --> 07:42.250
This conversation now takes place
on our terms.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.291
You can't keep her from me.
I'm her mother.

07:47.291 --> 07:50.791
What you are to that child right now
is a death sentence.

07:50.791 --> 07:55.041
Adrian Lovell and Hector Álvarez
represent ruthless business interests.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.625
If you leave here with that child,
they will kill her.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.958
Lovell already stabbed a pregnant belly.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.625
What would he do to a live child?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.166
Adrian Lovell is dead.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.291
Lovell was extracted from the house fire
before backup arrived.

08:08.291 --> 08:11.333
His body was never accounted for.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.083
Your daughter will be placed
in witness security...

08:19.083 --> 08:21.125
My daughter is <i>not</i>
going into the foster system.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.041
...so no one knows who her mother is.

08:23.041 --> 08:25.208
You underestimate my ability
to protect my child.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.458
Yeah, well, I'm aware.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.083
Back-to-back tours
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

08:29.083 --> 08:33.916
46 confirmed kills,
accurate to 1,300 meters with an M24.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.291
Tell me how that helps her.

08:39.166 --> 08:43.166
You and I both know the only way
you protect that child is to disappear.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.416
And if I don't?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.833
They'll find you. Both of you.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.500
And just so you know,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.958
the FBI has a terrible record
of protecting the whereabouts of people

09:10.958 --> 09:12.958
who caused the death of federal agents.

09:19.708 --> 09:23.083
Termination of parental rights.
Sign when you're ready.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.291
- Let her in.
You sure?

09:45.291 --> 09:46.333
She's good.

09:48.666 --> 09:49.500
Hey.

09:51.708 --> 09:52.750
They just told me.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.166
You all right?

10:00.458 --> 10:01.708
Three things.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.958
One, you put her with good people.

10:07.166 --> 10:10.416
I want her to have the most boring,
stable life there is.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.541
It's a girl?

10:13.541 --> 10:15.791
Two, you let me know she's safe,

10:17.625 --> 10:18.916
every birthday.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.125
Three,

10:23.625 --> 10:25.000
if there's trouble...

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
you let me know.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.166
I owe you that.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.416
Is she yours?

10:54.250 --> 10:55.166
No.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.500
Don't sneak up on somebody with PTS--

11:50.791 --> 11:54.166
Well, now I'm really fucking triggered.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.333
You'll need a job.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.875
Some of the ranchers would pay good money
for shooters like you.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.041
Get rid of the wolves.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.958
I don't wanna shoot wolves.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.583
You found God or something?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.541
No.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.375
It's good. Thanks.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.125
- If you want--
- I don't want anything, Jons.

13:23.875 --> 13:27.250
Hey. We're all lost when we get out.

13:30.416 --> 13:31.666
I got more than lost.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.541
Whatever you've done, you're still here.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.833
Still time to make it right.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.958
Anybody sees us in town,
you don't know me.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.333
It's that bad?

15:54.708 --> 15:55.625
Another birthday.

15:56.791 --> 15:58.333
Let's see how big she got.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.541
It's not her birthday.

17:18.708 --> 17:19.791
<i>She's in trouble?</i>

17:21.708 --> 17:23.458
We gonna say hello first?

17:23.458 --> 17:24.375
Hello.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.166
Civilization is built
on the little things.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.625
Tell me what's going on, Cruise.

17:28.625 --> 17:33.708
ATF busted some of Hector Álvarez's men
at a stash house in Nuevo Laredo.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.750
Typical stuff. MK12s,
you know, bump stocks, silencers.

17:37.916 --> 17:39.208
But they also had this.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.666
The six men are in custody in Mexico.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.458
- We wanted you to ID them.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.208
You didn't bring me here for a lineup.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.583
I keep my promises.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.791
- I will protect her.
- Can't advise you on that.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.750
What's her name?

18:07.208 --> 18:08.541
You can tell me her name now.

18:09.791 --> 18:10.666
Her name is Zoe.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.166
It's Greek for "life."

18:33.750 --> 18:36.375
Okay, that was close. Almost.
- Almost!

19:49.375 --> 19:50.208
Hey, there.

20:34.541 --> 20:35.458
I know you.

21:14.416 --> 21:15.958
Hey!
Come on!

21:24.666 --> 21:27.833
Please, stop! Mom!

21:36.958 --> 21:38.041
Zoe!

21:40.250 --> 21:41.458
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>

21:41.458 --> 21:43.291
No!

23:35.291 --> 23:36.416
- You okay?
- Go! Drive!

23:45.750 --> 23:47.708
You knew this was coming.
You should've had people.

23:47.708 --> 23:50.958
I couldn't know how or when.
I couldn't know what Hector was--

23:50.958 --> 23:53.208
And you couldn't set up
a standard perimeter?

23:53.208 --> 23:56.791
Obviously that was beyond what I expected.
That was Hector's top lieutenants.

23:56.791 --> 23:58.916
Yes, Yanil Gonzalez,
the one who grabbed her.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.000
Tarantula.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.458
There's a change of clothes next to you.

24:16.583 --> 24:19.208
- I made you three promises.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.041
I kept them all and did what I could
to keep her a secret.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.583
Well, the secret's out.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.458
Whose clothes are these, some desk cop?

24:27.458 --> 24:28.416
They're my sister's.

24:28.416 --> 24:32.125
We have a team setting up at the house.
We'll wait for a ransom call.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.125
- There won't be any call.
- What do they want?

24:35.916 --> 24:36.916
Me.

24:37.875 --> 24:43.666
They can have a nice, long look at me
while I kill every last one of them.

24:44.583 --> 24:45.625
And then what?

24:48.333 --> 24:50.333
Then I get the kid back to her parents.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.208
They did a good job.

25:18.916 --> 25:19.833
Bathroom?

25:21.750 --> 25:23.166
She's using the facilities.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.125
Secure the backyard.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.041
Any guesses where we're going?

26:34.625 --> 26:35.791
Straight back to Cuba.

26:39.125 --> 26:39.958
We're married?

26:40.958 --> 26:42.416
Great place for a honeymoon.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.166
Hey...

27:44.375 --> 27:46.750
Throw away the gun.
- Calm down.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.416
Where's the girl?

27:49.416 --> 27:51.041
What's he done with her?

28:50.166 --> 28:51.916
Count those tiles. He's a cheater.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.208
- Shut up, old woman!
- I won't shut up!

29:00.125 --> 29:01.666
Stop that bitch!

29:05.291 --> 29:07.208
Get the hell out of my house!

29:41.833 --> 29:43.375
Cruise!

30:08.708 --> 30:10.583
Son of a bitch!

30:11.541 --> 30:13.583
Move!

30:16.708 --> 30:18.875
You fucked up my car.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.583
Put him in the trunk.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.375
<i>Hector está en la plantación.</i>

31:51.375 --> 31:53.250
What about the girl?

31:53.250 --> 31:54.583
Where's the girl?

31:56.375 --> 31:58.041
What girl?

32:00.458 --> 32:02.666
I'm asking the fucking questions!

32:03.583 --> 32:06.291
Where's the girl?
I don't think he knows.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.791
What'd he say?
Want me to tell?

32:09.791 --> 32:10.875
Let me translate.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.000
So this is how you interrogate.

32:15.916 --> 32:17.125
What happened?

32:19.375 --> 32:20.625
You get tired?

32:20.625 --> 32:21.791
Hector's whore.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.708
Okay. Okay. Okay.

32:26.708 --> 32:27.750
- Hey.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.625
Hector wants me there, right?

32:33.625 --> 32:36.750
But I'm not going in blind.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.083
Hold him back.

32:42.541 --> 32:43.916
Where you going?

32:46.791 --> 32:49.083
You gonna kiss me? Huh?

32:56.666 --> 32:58.708
You learn things in the service.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.375
The bubbles sting like hell, right? Now...

33:04.375 --> 33:05.875
Tell me, asshole.

33:06.833 --> 33:08.833
Where's the girl?

33:09.958 --> 33:11.083
La Plantación.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.166
Efila.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.666
- What's waiting for me?

33:18.666 --> 33:20.000
How many guards?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.083
All of them.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.375
It's a trap.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.125
I don't care.

33:27.666 --> 33:30.875
As long as we get Zoe, they can have me.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.500
He doesn't want you.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.333
And the things he's gonna do to her,

33:37.416 --> 33:39.458
she's never gonna forget.

33:44.708 --> 33:46.500
We gotta go.

34:12.208 --> 34:13.458
Here, let me help.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.875
So, you're not just barbed wire
around a fist.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.500
I'm whatever I need to be
to keep her safe.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.250
Including turning yourself into a ghost.

34:48.166 --> 34:49.166
Feel that?

34:52.333 --> 34:54.500
You could've let me die, but you didn't.

34:57.541 --> 34:58.458
You saved me.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.416
Why?

35:13.583 --> 35:14.916
You gave me water.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.125
At the safe house.

35:21.916 --> 35:24.166
It's like you knew
I was thirsty all the time.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.083
You were taking care of me and my baby.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.958
Felt like a man worth saving.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.583
How'd you get involved in all this shit?

35:42.125 --> 35:44.416
You and Lovell and Álvarez.

35:45.708 --> 35:46.583
I don't get it.

35:56.791 --> 35:57.625
Afghanistan.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.458
I want those targets on fire!

36:01.125 --> 36:05.458
<i>Lovell was ex-SAS,
training my sniper unit.</i>

36:05.458 --> 36:07.625
The trick is to perform when suffering.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.541
<i>I guess I stood out.</i>

36:10.208 --> 36:13.458
500 meters, even your heartbeat
will throw you off target.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.000
Of course he picked me.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.000
No family, no future.

36:21.541 --> 36:22.541
Nothing to lose.

36:22.541 --> 36:25.291
- So, you're a headhunter.
Not exactly.

36:25.291 --> 36:26.583
This war's an addiction.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.833
All it creates is chaos,
suffering, and people who need things.

36:29.833 --> 36:32.708
I'm just a man who can get those things.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.166
For whose side?

36:36.166 --> 36:38.166
A three-star general, an Uzbek warlord...

36:39.375 --> 36:43.583
Powerful people want things...
that aren't on the menu.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.458
I should've run the other direction.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.708
So why didn't you?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.000
What else was I gonna do
after the service?

36:53.416 --> 36:54.458
I was the best,

36:54.458 --> 36:59.083
and the best that I could hope for
was being a cashier at a retail chain.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.375
<i>Adrian was offering
more than that.</i>

37:12.333 --> 37:13.500
But you didn't take it.

37:14.291 --> 37:15.708
Did a tour in Guantanamo instead.

37:17.916 --> 37:20.166
<i>I wasn't gonna be his employee.</i>

37:20.750 --> 37:24.000
I waited until I had something
to bring to the table.

37:25.125 --> 37:25.958
Álvarez.

37:29.333 --> 37:32.916
Eighteen months in a guard tower
tends to sharpen the focus.

37:32.916 --> 37:33.916
Hector.

37:33.916 --> 37:37.541
<i>Hector was siphoning guns
off the base under everyone's noses.</i>

37:38.125 --> 37:39.125
Not mine.

37:40.541 --> 37:42.666
- I saw him for what he was.
- And what was that?

37:44.791 --> 37:46.000
My retirement plan.

37:49.041 --> 37:52.541
Hector's guns. Adrian's network.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.541
The potential was obvious.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.791
My problem is I've got an entire armory

37:57.791 --> 38:00.083
of Hector's stolen munitions
in that harbor,

38:01.125 --> 38:04.166
and I gotta make sure
those weapons find a good home.

38:06.458 --> 38:09.375
I've got the perfect home,
but your <i>repartero</i> boyfriend

38:09.375 --> 38:12.291
is trying to raise the price
you and I agreed on.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.875
Somebody's been studying
their Cuban slang.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.250
I've been taking orders my whole life.

38:20.875 --> 38:22.625
And it felt good to be in control.

38:22.625 --> 38:24.875
I bet you he's a better dancer
than you are.

38:40.416 --> 38:41.583
It was almost too easy.

38:44.166 --> 38:45.250
Until I was pregnant.

38:48.291 --> 38:49.916
And things turned...

38:53.333 --> 38:54.500
without me seeing it.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.041
There's more money than we thought.
I did good.

38:57.833 --> 38:58.833
Why is there more money?

38:58.833 --> 39:01.625
This dude
has very powerful friends, like you said,

39:01.625 --> 39:04.083
so sometimes they want things
that are not on the menu.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.625
<i>They were hiding something.</i>

39:12.458 --> 39:14.208
<i>I had to find out for myself.</i>

40:20.375 --> 40:21.708
And then you called us.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
Whose is she?

40:31.500 --> 40:32.916
If you don't mind me asking.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.750
She's not Hector's.

40:41.625 --> 40:42.916
And she's not Adrian's.

40:45.958 --> 40:47.208
She's mine.

40:54.333 --> 40:55.250
Let's go.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.375
- In position.
<i>Copy.</i>

41:46.500 --> 41:47.708
<i>Four on the west side.</i>

41:47.708 --> 41:51.416
I see them. Another two out front.
Hector's moving up in the world.

41:51.416 --> 41:54.833
No. Adrian handed him this place
and he let it rot on the vine.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.333
She's in there somewhere.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.666

44:44.333 --> 44:46.083
I've got eyes on her. Get in position.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.833
Come with me now.

44:49.750 --> 44:51.791
Give me your hand. Come on.

44:51.791 --> 44:54.208
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.666
Help!

44:55.666 --> 44:57.125
I am helping.

44:57.125 --> 44:58.458
You're hurting me.

44:59.458 --> 45:01.208
I got her. We're on our way.

45:01.208 --> 45:02.500
Jesus, my arm!

45:02.500 --> 45:05.666
Shh, you stay right here.
You stay right by my side.

45:08.833 --> 45:10.375
Heading to you in ten seconds.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.208
William!

45:24.250 --> 45:25.416
It's okay now.

45:25.416 --> 45:28.083
It's okay. It's all right. Hey.

45:32.208 --> 45:34.583
Let me look at you. Okay?

45:38.250 --> 45:39.208
Let's go.

45:40.375 --> 45:41.500
I'm not finished.

46:06.750 --> 46:10.208
Lower the gun...

46:13.458 --> 46:15.250
Throw it out of the window.

46:17.625 --> 46:18.750
Throw it!

46:22.208 --> 46:23.625
Hands up.

46:25.791 --> 46:26.916
Turn around.

46:28.083 --> 46:29.125
Turn.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.708
Yes. Slow like that.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.333
So hot...

46:40.166 --> 46:42.208
You sold your soul to the devil.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.708
How come you still look so good?

46:45.708 --> 46:47.208
Why get that little girl involved?

46:48.500 --> 46:49.625
She's not that little.

46:52.833 --> 46:54.541
You're not getting away this time.

46:56.375 --> 46:57.708
You're in my universe.

46:59.166 --> 47:00.791
This is my castle.

47:03.041 --> 47:04.333
Must be a nice life.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.416
You need a dozen people
to guard you while you sleep.

47:10.375 --> 47:12.208
They're all gone, by the way.

47:12.208 --> 47:14.583
Well, then they died for a good cause...

47:16.416 --> 47:18.000
because I dream about this.

47:19.750 --> 47:22.500
Actually, my dick gets hard
thinking about this.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.083
You should've thought about that
more back in the day.

47:26.958 --> 47:29.458
<i>Coño.</i> You're gonna go that low?

47:32.166 --> 47:33.708
Let me ask you, then...

47:35.625 --> 47:36.791
Is the little girl...

47:40.500 --> 47:42.333
- Is she mine?
- Does it matter?

47:43.916 --> 47:46.791
No. No, what matters
is that you sold me out.

47:48.958 --> 47:50.875
That you shit on everything we built.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.833
Are you going to pay me back now?

47:57.375 --> 47:58.708
I have this dream...

48:01.041 --> 48:02.375
where I make you beg...

48:06.125 --> 48:07.208
and scream.

48:08.250 --> 48:10.375
Do you remember the games we used to play?

48:12.375 --> 48:13.791
There's no safe word now.

48:15.875 --> 48:17.250
We can do it for real.

48:18.583 --> 48:19.625
Hmm?

48:20.125 --> 48:22.125
I'm gonna watch you die like an animal.

48:23.958 --> 48:25.291
You don't have the balls.

48:26.541 --> 48:27.541
No?

48:29.458 --> 48:30.875
- Try me.

48:33.750 --> 48:37.833
I'm gonna get you real turned on.
Then I'm going to split you in half.

48:40.541 --> 48:41.916
Do you remember the safe word?

48:51.875 --> 48:52.958
We never had a safe word.

49:19.125 --> 49:21.750
<i>Please do not leave baggage unattended.</i>

51:18.875 --> 51:22.000
So, I think she's bouncing back.
Talked to her mother.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.750
Pancakes will be on the table
when we arrive.

51:24.750 --> 51:27.375
This is for Zoe. Thanks.

51:41.083 --> 51:41.916
Thanks.

51:43.333 --> 51:45.250
Thank the FBI. Cruise got it for you.

52:01.583 --> 52:03.083
You'll be okay from here.

52:05.416 --> 52:06.500
You know, they have...

52:08.791 --> 52:11.666
services and counseling
and people to talk to.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.125
Where are you going?

52:22.291 --> 52:24.916
Cruise will be out soon.
You should wait in the car.

52:32.250 --> 52:33.166
Are you my mother?

52:44.708 --> 52:45.666
No.

52:51.791 --> 52:54.875
So that's it?
You're just gonna vanish again, huh?

53:05.041 --> 53:08.625
She's 12. Just let her go be a kid.

53:11.250 --> 53:13.208
Let this all just be a bad memory.

53:14.541 --> 53:15.541
Hey.

53:24.041 --> 53:25.000
Stay in touch.

53:42.833 --> 53:46.250
We got about six more hours,
so if you wanna take a nap, be my guest.

53:47.958 --> 53:49.458
Why won't she just admit it?

53:50.375 --> 53:51.208
What's that?

53:52.625 --> 53:53.791
That she's my mother.

53:57.208 --> 54:00.250
Zoe, let's just get you back
to your real family, okay?

54:46.875 --> 54:48.666
Look, here is the head.

54:49.666 --> 54:50.500
And this

54:51.833 --> 54:52.708
is the heart.

54:53.416 --> 54:54.333
Do you see it?

55:14.666 --> 55:16.083
Not too far now.

55:16.875 --> 55:19.000
Tonight, you get to sleep in your own bed.

55:21.291 --> 55:22.541
How about that?

55:23.541 --> 55:25.000
That sounds really nice.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.791
Yeah.
You and your BFF still getting along?

55:28.791 --> 55:30.875
BFF?
Ain't that what you call it?

56:20.166 --> 56:25.708
William... William... William...

57:15.083 --> 57:16.041
Goodness me.

57:22.750 --> 57:25.708
Now, where is your mother?

57:52.041 --> 57:53.375
Lower the gun.

57:59.708 --> 58:00.583
Get behind me.

58:05.083 --> 58:06.583
Look at the mess you made.

58:10.291 --> 58:11.541
Do you know this man?

58:13.750 --> 58:14.708
Hmm?

58:16.750 --> 58:17.750
Who is he?

58:19.916 --> 58:23.875
Someone from child welfare?
Social Services?

58:27.125 --> 58:28.000
Oh, no.

58:28.750 --> 58:32.583
Not with that standard FBI holster.

58:48.208 --> 58:49.375
- No!
- Run!

59:00.750 --> 59:01.666
Zoe!

59:03.208 --> 59:04.083
Zoe!

59:46.250 --> 59:47.166
Here you go.

59:55.208 --> 59:56.666
When am I going home?

59:59.291 --> 01:00:01.083
Look, you saw what was out there.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.291
That's gonna keep coming.

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:07.333
The feds can protect your parents,

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.375
but they can't protect us. Nobody can.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:11.750
So we just keep moving
and cover our tracks.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:19.875
Who were they?

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:23.375
You don't need to know.

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:25.833
Bad people, that's all.

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.250
Well, what do they want from me?

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.375
You're a chip,

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:36.916
something to bargain with.

01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:43.000
I can't explain it to you at your age.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:49.541
You're a kid. It'll scare you.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.708
Better not do that.

01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:58.333
I forgot, I... This is for you.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.083
Where are we going?

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:06.750
Far.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:10.916
Go use the restroom.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:33.750
- Ma'am?
- For the truck.

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:42.708
- Hello?
- I called to tell you that she's safe.

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:47.125
- Let me talk to her, please.
- She can't.

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:50.541
- What did you say?
- She can't come back to her life yet.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:51.875
Not yet.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.125
What does that mean?

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.333
No, I... I don't understand.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.416
I don't understand any of this,

01:01:58.416 --> 01:02:00.500
so explain to me what that means.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.375
- You'll have to trust me.
- Are you serious?

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:05.083
I promise that she's just--

01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:08.041
No, he promised me
you would never come back.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.875
<i>I'm talking about Agent Cruise.
They told me what happened.</i>

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Did you see it happen?

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:18.583
Yes.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.958
Did she see it too?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.083
Yes.

01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:31.125
Hey, I need a minute.
Need a minute. I can't--

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:32.166
Hey.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.291
I will get her back to her home.
Okay? Back to you.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:40.791
As soon as it's safe.

01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:43.750
Guess that's not a date
I can put in my calendar.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.916
Her birthday's in October.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.250
- I know that.
- Of course you do.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.416
Look, Cruise kept his promises,

01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:00.708
I keep mine.

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.583
You'll see her blow out another candle.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:06.750
You have my word.

01:03:10.208 --> 01:03:12.416
- Get in.
- No, where's my phone?

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.375
Get in the truck.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.166
I need my phone.

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:21.958
You need to get in the truck.

01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:47.833
<i>♪ Silly love, oh ♪</i>

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:52.416

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.000
A nice-looking young lady you got.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:20.375
Thanks, we're just passing through.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.208
Oh, that's a pity.

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:26.750
If you were here a while,
you could take a look at the salmon run.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.875
It's just fish swimming upstream,
laying their eggs to die.

01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:33.083
Not very romantic, looking at it that way.

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:36.291
You must be doing some hunting.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.916
Dall sheep?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.083
Caribou?

01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:46.583
Grizzlies.

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:50.125
You might wanna stock up too.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.833
What is it, Halloween? Put those back.

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:06.250
Sir, she'll pay for that.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:07.250
It's on the house.

01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:12.625
Enjoy the great outdoors.

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.208
You knew that guy, right?

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:19.583
What?

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.458
Why are you pretending
you don't know each other?

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:24.625
Because we don't.

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.000
Strangers don't talk like that.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.041
It was like...

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.250
spies or something, talking in code.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:07.958
Put these on.

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:19.541
We're going to eat.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.875
- It's beautiful.
- Shh.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.708
No! No! [gasping] No.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.083
Let's go.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.458
- Eat.
- I can't.

01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:20.500
Yes, you can.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.166
Not eating Bambi's mom.

01:07:28.583 --> 01:07:30.208
That's not venison.

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:32.583
The deer has to hang
for the meat to tenderize.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.583
Besides, that was a stag,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.500
so it would be Bambi's dad.

01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:43.125
- What is this, then?
- Rabbit.

01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:47.375
Thumper.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:50.166
Not eating a rabbit either.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:52.708
Listen to me,

01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:56.041
that rabbit had a better life
than any cheeseburger you ever ate.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.000
He had a beautiful life
until you shot him.

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:04.625
- I trapped him.
- Much better.

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.333
Let me tell you something, kid.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.666
There's nothing you ever ate
that didn't come from violence.

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:15.458
Tofu.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.291
Half of Paraguay was burned and deforested
for soy plantations.

01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:22.083
Cheese.

01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:25.083
Those cows are impregnated
just so they can be pulled on all day.

01:08:25.833 --> 01:08:27.250
- Gross.
- Hmm.

01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:30.291
Cashew cheese.

01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:34.333
I know a mercenary in the Ivory Coast,
said they fought a civil war

01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:37.125
over cashews.

01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:43.458
I wanna go home.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.083
I know you do.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.208
Eat.

01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:14.416
Meet me outside in five minutes.

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:30.958
You're driving.

01:09:31.916 --> 01:09:32.833
I'm 12.

01:09:33.541 --> 01:09:34.791
So I'll teach you.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:37.625
Why?

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:39.166
You wanna go home?

01:09:40.333 --> 01:09:41.333
I want that too.

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.916
But not till you know how to survive,
everything it takes.

01:09:44.916 --> 01:09:46.375
And this is where we start.

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:52.625
What, you hate me?

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.541
Good. Use it.

01:09:57.416 --> 01:10:00.458
'Cause you're gonna work harder
than you ever thought you could.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:04.000
Then you'll run out your reserve tank
and find you had more,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.708
and you'll run that out too.

01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:07.541
But when it's done,

01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:10.000
you're gonna drive outta here yourself.

01:10:14.416 --> 01:10:15.708
What's the matter, scared?

01:10:17.416 --> 01:10:18.416
Yes, very.

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:21.375
Then do this.

01:10:28.166 --> 01:10:29.583
Put the key in the ignition.

01:10:31.916 --> 01:10:35.166
Yeah. Turn it over. Turn it.

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:40.458
Here, pull this down.

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.791
Forward and down. Ready? Go.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.541
Get your rifle up.
You don't get to catch your breath.

01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:05.291
We do this so you can think
when you're exhausted.

01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:07.041
Head up, eyes ahead.

01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:10.083
Chamber.

01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:15.791
- Focus.

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:17.000
Breathe out.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:22.166
- Shoot.

01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:26.708
Again.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.541
- Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

01:11:37.541 --> 01:11:40.250
Do you wanna come play? Of course you do.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.541
Hi! Hi! Oh, my gosh.

01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:45.291
They're not pets. Nothing out here is.

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:56.625
How close is she?

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:58.791
Right behind you.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:12.583
- Run!

01:12:19.916 --> 01:12:21.458
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

01:12:21.458 --> 01:12:23.291
You shot the mom!

01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:27.416
No. No, look.
The green ones are just salt shells.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:31.166
Just good for scaring something off.

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:35.541
See?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.916
Come on.

01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:00.500
Don't ever put that in your mouth again.
It's not for you. You don't do that.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.208
- You do it.

01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:05.041
You're not me. You hear me?

01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:08.583
- You're not me.
- I don't wanna be you.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:11.125
I wanna go home.

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:16.500
I hate it here.

01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:21.583
- Put it down.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:25.375
No. I'm leaving. You're not stopping me.

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:29.708
Look at you shake.

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.250
- You're not ready.
- I am ready.

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:39.500
Prove it.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:41.416
Don't make me--

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:44.541
Why are you such a bitch?

01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:47.750
Don't you call me a bitch!
Don't you ever call me a bitch!

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.750
Keeping you safe doesn't make me a bitch.

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.791
- Lying to me does.
- How am I lying?

01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.541
I know who you are.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:59.000
That's not lying. That's just not talking
about things that don't matter.

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:03.250
Besides, you already have a good mom.

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:05.625
I miss her so much.

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:10.208
I miss her and my dad, and I'm not allowed
to talk to you about anything

01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:14.666
if it's not how to gut a fish
or how to field dress a duck!

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:18.125
I'm serious.

01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:20.583
Field dress a duck?

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:22.125
I can't talk to you.

01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:26.333
I can't ask any questions.

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:28.541
Zoe.

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:32.041
The answers are tough.

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:33.958
So?

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:38.791
There's things in this world
you don't need to know yet.

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:40.916
What things?

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:45.791
Please.

01:14:57.041 --> 01:14:57.875
I'm here.

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:07.583
Whatever the question, that's your answer.

01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:13.833
And it's the only one I got.

01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:39.125
Open it.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.958
You have to practice,
get the timing right.

01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:53.041
If you grip too soon, you cut yourself.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:56.791
Give me your arm.

01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:04.333
A knife fight means your enemy's close.

01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:07.083
You can't hit him just once.

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:10.875
You can never stop hitting him
until he can't hit back.

01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:14.583
That's how you protect yourself.

01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:18.333
You just keep hitting him again
and again and again, just...

01:16:20.833 --> 01:16:22.125
You're scaring me.

01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:24.708
Every time I look at you, I'm scared.

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:29.000
You? You don't feel anything.

01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:33.625
Well, it's the only way to survive.

01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:40.125
Nine o'clock.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.833
Ten o'clock.

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:46.583
Eleven o'clock.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:50.333
Twelve o'clock.

Do you ever miss William?

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.791
Agent Cruise?

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:17.666
I do.

01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:22.500
Did you love him, then?

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:29.291
- I never got a chance to find out.
- But maybe?

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:33.458
Maybe.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:34.708
Maybe's something.

01:17:37.541 --> 01:17:38.833
For me, maybe's a lot.

01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:47.708
You gotta be careful now.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:53.208
You hear me? Remember where they are.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:08.833
What happened to her?

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:10.750
She's hurt.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.166
We have to help her.

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:16.041
It's nature. You can't change it.

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:21.041
But her cubs aren't old enough
to hunt on their own.

01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:24.500
Well, if she dies, they'll have to learn.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.666
Or they won't.

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:30.458
You can't change it either way.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:01.916
Zoe?

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:10.125
Zoe!

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:13.791
Zoe!

01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:20.958
Zoe!

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:31.291
Zoe!

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:40.875
Do it again. Good boy!
That's a good boy.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.250
- Hey.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.625
Here. You guys want some food?

01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:48.750
You guys want some food? I have some food.

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:51.375
Here. Come here. Come here.

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:55.041
- Watch out!

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:04.625
- Let me see.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:07.291
Okay. Okay.

01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:17.833
Let me see.

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:20.666
Oh, yeah. Let's get you stitched up.

01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:22.583
We'll get started on her.
You're her mother?

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:25.916
There's some paperwork on the counter.
Come on. This way, sweetie.

01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:49.250
It's not too bad.
Only took eight stitches.

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:53.625
I'm gonna send the nurse in
with some aftercare instructions.

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:55.125
Zoe here is a brave girl.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.625
Get your coat on.

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:08.041
I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to tell him my real name.

01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:09.666
No, I should have told you.

01:22:23.708 --> 01:22:25.791
She gave her name.
They put it in the computer.

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:33.875
I can't risk it. You have to take her.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:50.250
Just give her this when it's all over.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:06.500
I hate you!

01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:33.666
<i>How many?</i>
It's a full platoon.

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:40.875
<i>She won't be safe till they're all gone.
Do you see him?</i>

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:44.416
Not sure. I'll take Zoe and go.

01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:48.833
Well, tell her that I said I'm sorry
that I lied about you and me.

01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:49.750
<i>About what?</i>

01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:52.666
<i>- She'll know.</i>

01:23:53.416 --> 01:23:54.583
Where am I going now?

01:23:57.041 --> 01:23:59.708
We're taking a trip back to the lower 48.

01:23:59.708 --> 01:24:01.666
Don't talk in code to me too.

01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.208
Fair enough.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:09.500
I don't know. And that's the truth.

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:12.083
We run until we get the word.

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:15.083
How do you know her?

01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:20.791
We served together, a long time ago.

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:24.708
I'm not much good
in a fight anymore, though.

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:29.166
And even if I was,
I suspect she'd still want me right here,

01:24:29.166 --> 01:24:31.208
making sure that you're safe.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.500
She won't even admit she's my mother.

01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:38.833
A woman like that,

01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:42.000
you gotta pay attention to what she does,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.916
not what she says.

01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:46.625
And all she lives for is you.

01:25:53.208 --> 01:25:54.208
<i>Dear Zoe.</i>

01:25:55.541 --> 01:26:00.958
<i>When I left you in the hospital,
it was not the end of me caring about you.</i>

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:07.208
<i>Every decision I've made has been for you.</i>

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:14.208
<i>The only thing that gave me any peace
was knowing you were safe.</i>

01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:20.666
<i>I'm a killer. You know that now.</i>

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:28.166
<i>But I'm also a mother,
and I will die protecting you.</i>

01:26:29.416 --> 01:26:30.833
<i>For all my mistakes,</i>

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:36.625
<i>you are the one good and beautiful thing
that I have done with my life.</i>

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:40.125
<i>You are a marvel.</i>

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:44.125
<i>Someone tried to kill you
before you were born,</i>

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:48.083
<i>and you didn't just live, you flourished.</i>

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:50.916
<i>When you look in the mirror,</i>

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:54.333
<i>remember it's a sign that you survived.</i>

01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:58.750
<i>That you would not let anyone
or anything erase you.</i>

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.708
<i>I have shown you my love
in the only way I know how.</i>

01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:11.125
<i>When the time comes for you
to use what I've taught you,</i>

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:14.625
<i>don't hesitate
to take your place in this world.</i>

01:27:17.083 --> 01:27:20.291
<i>Love always, your mother.</i>

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:41.541
Zoe. We gotta go.

01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:54.166
- This is the kill zone.

01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:57.625
Treat this as you would Basra, Brega,

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:00.166
or Damascus.

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:04.416
Treat her as you would a hundred snipers.

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:08.000
I'm the one who kills her.

01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:11.958
And I kill her close.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.000
She's got the woods mined.

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:51.750
<i>Proceed with caution.
I repeat, proceed with caution.</i>

01:30:12.041 --> 01:30:16.083
Time to send her a message.

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:47.041
- Check for the girl's remains.

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:06.000
<i>I see a little girl
driving a truck, south road.</i>

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.125
Converge on the south road.
Get me the girl.

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:23.041
Zoe!

01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:25.791
Jump!

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:42.000
- Here. Put this on.

01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:20.458
They're coming.

01:33:21.708 --> 01:33:22.791
- No.
- I can do it.

01:33:22.791 --> 01:33:25.041
You can track. I pull the trigger.

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:44.083
I see one. He's on foot.

01:33:45.416 --> 01:33:48.333
Range 658.

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:53.250
Hold left side of his head.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.208
- Now.

01:33:58.416 --> 01:34:00.375
<i>Our girl's got potential.</i>

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:04.958
<i>She's so like you.</i>

01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:10.583
<i>Meet me two clicks
to the left of your position</i>

01:34:12.166 --> 01:34:14.375
<i>or I destroy that potential right now.</i>

01:34:16.166 --> 01:34:18.166
No! Wait!

01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:20.041
It'll take me two minutes
to get down there.

01:34:20.833 --> 01:34:22.375
I distract him, you run.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:25.333
No matter what. You hear me?

01:34:25.333 --> 01:34:27.250
- I can cover, I really can.
- No.

01:34:31.083 --> 01:34:33.333
These have been the best months
of my life with you.

01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:42.041
No matter what, you run.

01:34:56.708 --> 01:34:58.625
Drop your weapons over the side.

01:35:07.375 --> 01:35:08.916
And the other one.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.833
The camouflage, too. All of it.

01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:38.708
You have the shot, take it!

01:35:46.458 --> 01:35:47.750
All in good time.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.750
You burned down our entire world...

01:35:59.791 --> 01:36:01.041
...for her.

01:36:02.958 --> 01:36:03.791
Yes.

01:36:15.166 --> 01:36:16.375
Come on.

01:37:06.916 --> 01:37:08.208
See where you're looking?

01:37:09.166 --> 01:37:10.791
She's just up there, isn't she?

01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:13.166
She's watching.

01:37:14.166 --> 01:37:16.000
She's got a shot, eh?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.500
Bullet in your head will take us both out.

01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:24.333
Did you teach her to be ruthless? Hmm?

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:26.958
Can she stop her heart like you?

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:31.750
We die and she survives.

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:34.250
If that's what you want,

01:37:35.625 --> 01:37:38.958
take a breath and tell her.

01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:41.958
Tell her.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.208
Take the shot!

01:38:15.083 --> 01:38:17.375
Come on, please. Please come on.

01:38:19.541 --> 01:38:21.958
Please, please, please...

01:38:21.958 --> 01:38:24.250
- It's okay.

01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:26.083
Please! Please! Please!

01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:31.583
Please! Please! Please!

01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:39.500
Salt.

01:40:18.041 --> 01:40:19.375
Fuck.

01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:30.958
Fuck.

01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:16.625
No!

01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:12.208
Go to your mother.

01:43:22.458 --> 01:43:23.375
I love you.

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.583
I love you too.

01:43:33.208 --> 01:43:34.083
Go.

01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:46.208
Zoe!

01:43:52.541 --> 01:43:53.916
Oh, look at you!

01:43:54.583 --> 01:43:56.083
I love you so much.

01:44:08.166 --> 01:44:09.958
