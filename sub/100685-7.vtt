WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.760
So when does Kennedy
lower the boom?

00:09.802 --> 00:11.595
We're meeting with Chandler
this morning.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.222
She'll be looking
to renegotiate.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.682
Won't she be surprised.

00:16.392 --> 00:19.603
This Three Oh Eight video
that dropped last night...

00:19.645 --> 00:21.564
Nothing to worry about
in my view.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.483
They're still persons of
interest in the Craver murder.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.110
Got to follow every lead.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.452
Tread lightly with these people.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.786
Yes, sir.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.417
ALICIA:
He'll never do it. I know him.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.462
-MAXWELL: You said
he was practical.
-Pig-headed.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.465
MAXWELL:
It can't trace back to me.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.508
ALICIA:
You can use Stan's.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.345
Chandler will try
to get this suppressed.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.972
Her chances?

00:55.014 --> 00:57.099
-(phone beeps)
-Slim to none.

00:57.141 --> 01:00.853
-SECRETARY: It's
Honey Chandler.
-Speak of the devil.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.230
Send her in, please.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.400
We went by the book.
The tape will hold up.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.278
"Conspiracy supersedes consent."

01:09.320 --> 01:10.738
(knocking on door)

01:16.827 --> 01:19.580
Please don't stand
on my account.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.582
(sighs)

01:21.624 --> 01:24.835
-May I? For the record?
-Go ahead.

01:28.506 --> 01:31.675
Three days ago, Clifford Maxwell
was killed by the FBI

01:31.717 --> 01:33.677
as they attempted
to take him into custody

01:33.719 --> 01:35.679
for the murder of Stanley Kent.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.182
-We won't revisit the plea deal.
-Not asking you to.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.975
Mrs. Kent is ready
to accept the plea

01:40.017 --> 01:41.185
and proceed immediately
to sentencing.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.312
In fact, we're pulling it.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.607
-I'm sorry?
-The plea agreement.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.025
We're pulling it.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.485
We have new evidence
that your client

01:49.527 --> 01:51.487
has been less than truthful
in her proffer.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.322
We're filing additional charges
against her

01:53.364 --> 01:55.741
for the murder of her husband.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.786
What new evidence?

01:58.828 --> 02:01.914
Come on, don't be coy.
I'll get it in discovery.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.755
We have Alicia Kent on tape
planning her husband's murder

02:09.797 --> 02:13.133
with her lover,
FBI Agent Clifford Maxwell.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.830
Guys? Ladies?
Let's raise our glass.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.500
A toast to Ryan Rodgers.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.879
-BARREL: Ho!
-Ho! That's right,
a Native Son of the Golden West.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.881
As Ryan-o liked to say,

03:33.923 --> 03:35.799
you know, besides
his drop-dead good looks,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.469
he had something else in common
with Robert Redford,

03:38.510 --> 03:41.305
he was born and raised
in the San Fernando Valley.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.515
You know, back when it was still
orange groves and lemon trees,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.976
and woolly mammoths roamed
the Earth-- that kind of thing.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.979
-(laughter)
-As a cop, he bled blue,

03:49.021 --> 03:53.025
as his many awards and citations
for valor will attest.

03:53.067 --> 03:56.445
As a homicide detective,
he distinguished himself

03:56.487 --> 03:59.448
with his dogged dedication
to the victims

03:59.490 --> 04:03.118
and his tenacity
in pursuing the perpetrators.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.122
But above all,
as a comrade and a friend,

04:07.164 --> 04:11.251
Ryan Rodgers always had
another tall tale to tell,

04:11.293 --> 04:15.422
was always good
for another round and always,

04:15.464 --> 04:17.758
always...

04:17.800 --> 04:20.636
always had your back.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.638
To Ryan Rodgers,
big man, big heart.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.807
-Ryan-o!
-ALL: Ryan-o!

04:24.848 --> 04:27.017
(cheering)

04:29.853 --> 04:31.647
-Thank you.
-(whispers): You're welcome.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.774
LAPD's finest.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.609
There's a reason
all these old-school guys

04:35.651 --> 04:37.611
are here to celebrate your dad.

04:37.653 --> 04:38.988
Besides free drinks?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.823
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

04:40.864 --> 04:42.950
Ryan Rodgers was a cop's cop.

04:42.992 --> 04:45.786
-Everybody mattered.
-Except us.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.621
That's not true, Melissa.

04:47.663 --> 04:50.624
You and your mother
are what mattered most of all.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.127
Your dad just went
through a rough patch.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.129
BARREL:
Oldest story in the book.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.089
The family takes the hit,
always.

Chief.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.679
Melissa.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.889
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:05.931 --> 05:09.268
Thank you for coming.
Dad would have been pleased.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.687
He was a real credit
to the department.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.689
-I considered him a friend.
-But when the job

05:13.731 --> 05:15.566
was getting to be
too much for him,

05:15.607 --> 05:17.776
you exiled him
to Pacific Division.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.987
That's not how it happened.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.364
Final straw, graveyard shift.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.782
Broke up their marriage.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.618
He was more distant,
more isolated than ever.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.620
You should know,

05:28.662 --> 05:31.457
your father volunteered
for the late show.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.000
Why would he do that?

05:33.042 --> 05:35.169
To shield his family
from what troubled him.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.673
By cutting himself off from us?

05:39.715 --> 05:41.842
It didn't work.

Just happy I could be here, give

No idea. No idea why he kept it.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.701
Have you listened to it?

How? Who's got

You need anything,
don't you hesitate to holler.

-Thank you.
-All right.

-Johns who answered online ads.

Founder's in jail,
Feds seized the site.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.327
So you also know that records
from '09 will be long gone.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.330
All right.
Put her over there, pal.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.332
It's a cold case, low priority.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.417
Understood. Whenever.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.419
Yeah, could be months.

Oh, I like Susanna.

As the ranking board member

08:44.316 --> 08:46.276
of the L.A. Trial
Lawyers Association...

08:46.318 --> 08:49.154
Trial lawyers skew left.
We're not prosecutors.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.450
But if the woman who's battled
his department for years

08:53.492 --> 08:56.245
endorses his candidacy...

08:57.579 --> 09:00.666
He must be one
hell of a candidate.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.502
Must be.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
Is this coming from you or him?

09:07.339 --> 09:11.343
He'd like to, uh,
meet to discuss it.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.599
Why not?

09:25.607 --> 09:27.734
GPS location points?

09:27.776 --> 09:30.279
For the burner phone
Maxwell sent that photo to.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.323
The one that outed Craver
as a snitch.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.702
These are from the past month.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.997
-Phone was on and off.
-And this big cluster?

09:40.038 --> 09:41.999
Charlie Dax's house.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.333
This one's the nursery?

09:43.375 --> 09:46.211
Correct. Where Dax's wife works.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.048
Kids' school, Travis Strout's
house, Waylon Strout's shop.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.426
Got to be Dax's burner.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.261
What about the night
Craver was murdered?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.179
EDGAR:
Nothing on the night,

09:56.221 --> 09:57.389
but the phone was
in Craver's neighborhood

09:57.431 --> 09:58.640
several times the week before.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.686
We need Dax's DNA.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.111
What?

10:14.239 --> 10:16.491
Well, the tape's fake.
It has to be.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.536
I never said anything
about killing Stan.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.621
Did you ever say anything
to anyone

10:21.663 --> 10:23.498
that could be construed
as a death threat?

10:23.540 --> 10:24.833
Never.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.544
Cliff and I talked about
different scenarios,

10:27.586 --> 10:29.212
how things would go.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.631
He could have doctored the tape.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.260
We'll have a forensics expert
go over it.

10:35.302 --> 10:39.556
-But I thought that
in the state of California...

10:39.598 --> 10:40.599
Come in.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.312
-Sorry to interrupt.
-That's okay.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.024
Okay, thanks, Maddie.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.155
(door opens, closes)

10:55.197 --> 10:58.075
-You were saying?
-I thought that in
the state of California,

10:58.116 --> 11:01.953
both parties have to consent
to being recorded.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.705
(sighs)

11:03.747 --> 11:06.291
He recorded me in secret
without my consent.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.378
We'll make that clear
in pretrial.

11:09.419 --> 11:13.632
Don't worry, there are weak
links in every prosecution.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.469
(whispering): Listen, Dax, we've
spent way too many resources...

11:17.511 --> 11:18.637
I don't give a fuck.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
I'm staying clear of it.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.182
If you're smart, you will, too.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.788
(indistinct chatter)

12:02.514 --> 12:03.765
It's all right.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.643
Pizza police.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.037
I got 'em both, just in case.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.386
Hey.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.015
Do you know where Mank keeps
his private stock?

12:45.056 --> 12:47.017
No.

12:47.058 --> 12:51.104
That stuff on the pod rack
could drive a man to milk.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.691
Uh, Captain, probably
something I should mention.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.944
What's that?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.779
It's probably nothing,

12:59.821 --> 13:03.408
but with HR protocol
and whatnot...

13:03.450 --> 13:04.784
Sure.

13:04.826 --> 13:08.997
My partner's been talking
to me about Lieutenant Billets.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.708
What about Billets?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.752
You know L.T.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.214
She's a warm person,
which is fine with me.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.967
But I guess it makes my partner
a little uncomfortable.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.427
The handsy stuff.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.806
Right. Boundaries.
Personal space.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.270
It's probably nothing, right?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.730
But Vega mentioned it
more than once,

13:33.772 --> 13:36.858
so I felt I had to
say something.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.736
Because if I don't,
and it was something, well...

13:39.778 --> 13:41.738
Appropriate you brought it
to me, Pierce.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.740
See something, say something.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.743
-I didn't really see anything.
-Of course.

13:46.785 --> 13:50.372
Between us.
Not to worry.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.463
Hey.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.842
Brenner gonna bitch about you

14:02.884 --> 14:04.678
expediting that
through your lab?

14:04.719 --> 14:08.431
He's just praying Craver's
killer's anybody but Maxwell.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.517
I have Heather Strout's DNA
on that waiver she signed

14:10.559 --> 14:12.185
with a bloody thumbprint;
I'll have it checked, too.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.812
Thanks.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.858
I heard the D.A. pulled
Alicia Kent's plea.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.528
Maxwell's tape
blew up her story.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.076
You okay?

14:30.662 --> 14:32.414
Looks like a desk is my future.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.422
Nah, you'll be back in action.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.215
Even the Bureau isn't that dumb.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.676
(chuckles) They are, but thanks
for keeping the faith.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.844
I appreciate it.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.267
-Harry?
-Yeah?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.062
Never mind.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.459
RODGERS:
Detective Ryan Rodgers, LAPD,

15:17.500 --> 15:21.087
interviewing...
state your name.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.339
BETO:
Beto Frank.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.841
RODGERS:
August 28, 1996.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.636
Mr. Frank, you are
a Police Academy cadet.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.720
Is that correct?

15:28.762 --> 15:30.639
BETO:
Yes, sir.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.391
RODGERS:
And you were arrested tonight
on Virgil Avenue,

15:33.433 --> 15:36.311
11:30 p.m., passenger
in a Pontiac Trans Am.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.563
BETO:
That's correct, sir.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.029
Gary's murder's getting lost.
It's all about Marcos and Arias.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.822
This thing with Hovan
will pay off.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.157
Just need to give it time.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.576
Yeah, you keep saying that.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.869
You gonna get Avril
on some bullshit

15:52.911 --> 15:53.912
money laundering charge.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.623
That's what you're
worried about?

15:56.665 --> 15:58.458
I'll never get justice
for my son.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.920
Eyewitness said Jamaicans
shot Gary.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.922
You got a Jamaican C.I.
Why don't you use him?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.842
That's Hovan's C.I.,
so Hovan calls the shots.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.678
I call bullshit.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.890
Hovan's frustrated, too.

16:13.932 --> 16:17.227
I'm beyond frustrated.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.895
Done with the waiting game,
Jerry.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.980
So you know.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.447
BETO:
We-we were just riding.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.701
RODGERS:
You were just riding
with three known gangbangers,

16:32.742 --> 16:34.369
Cadet Beto Frank?

16:34.411 --> 16:38.790
Or should I say ex-cadet,
as of a few hours ago?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.709
BETO:
I made a mistake in judgment.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.253
RODGERS:
You think? A drive-by shooting?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.046
BETO:
I didn't know that was
gonna happen.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.090
RODGERS:
You were in the car, son.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.134
-(door opens on tape)
-IRVING: Detective Rodgers.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.136
RODGERS:
Lieutenant.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.637
IRVING:
Turn off the tape.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
(clicks)

17:12.907 --> 17:15.493
BOSCH:
Whew, those don't make you cry?

17:15.535 --> 17:16.828
My superpower.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.872
(both chuckle)

17:24.252 --> 17:26.129
You saw Alex Sands again.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.465
I did.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.219
They were running a scam.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.473
Blackmail.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.142
Johns compromised.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.852
Underage girls, so on.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.854
Jesus.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.192
I didn't know.

17:49.736 --> 17:54.491
You think one of the johns
killed Daisy?

17:54.532 --> 17:56.868
A place to start.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.870
I swear to God, Harry,
I didn't know.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.290
Well, now that you do,

18:02.332 --> 18:05.585
I mean, is there anything
she said or-or did

18:05.627 --> 18:07.337
that makes sense in retrospect?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.423
No.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.261
I don't think so.
Not that I remember.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.977
I can't believe
that they would...

18:23.019 --> 18:26.648
Stupid fucking kids, man.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.253
-BARREL: I looked up
your record.
-BETO: Oh, yeah?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.630
Solid.
A few dings along the way.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.507
You know any cop worth a damn
that doesn't?

18:52.549 --> 18:55.927
Congrats, by the way,
on that truce in Boyle Heights.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.554
Right place, right time.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.389
Both sides were ready
to quit banging.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.184
How'd you get your hands
on that interview?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.770
Right place, right time.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.942
That was the worst night
of my life.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.486
I thought I was done
before I even got started.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.072
That would have killed my dad.
You know my dad?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.575
Assistant Chief Bill Frank?

19:18.616 --> 19:20.702
No, I never had the pleasure.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.829
Anglo, obviously.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.957
My mom, Dolores Marquez,
Chicana.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.460
I came up with a foot
in both worlds.

19:32.338 --> 19:36.759
So that night, you left behind
the Academy,

19:36.801 --> 19:39.178
your mom, your pop.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.223
You went cruising
with three gangbangers

19:42.265 --> 19:44.225
on a drive-by.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.644
Guys I grew up with.
To a party, not a drive-by.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.938
I had no idea it was gonna
go down like that.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.607
But you should have.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.234
I should have.
I was a knucklehead.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.737
Rodgers was ready to
ring me up on the spot.

19:55.778 --> 20:00.617
Yeah. Your career was finished
then and there.

20:00.658 --> 20:04.871
But then, Lieutenant Irving
comes in, stops the interview,

20:04.913 --> 20:06.289
pulls you out...

20:10.335 --> 20:12.503
How'd he know to come get you?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.342
I don't know.
That was a long time ago.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.385
I think you do.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.765
I think you know
your dad called Irving

20:23.806 --> 20:25.934
and told him to shut it down.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.271
Chief Irving
made a judgment call.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.607
Saved my life.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.276
And I made very fucking sure
I've never done anything since

20:35.318 --> 20:37.153
to make him regret
that decision.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.910
How do you spell that?

20:43.952 --> 20:47.121
Okay. Thanks.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.501
Got the bullet back
that killed Craver finally.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.835
The chemical residue?

20:52.877 --> 20:55.254
Imidacloprid.
It's a neonicotinoid.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.298
(chuckles) You're having
way too much fun with this.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.801
Insecticide. Used in nurseries.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.054
We should call Angel City,
see if they use it.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.889
Feds already did.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.265
And they do.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.309
One more piece of the puzzle.

21:08.351 --> 21:11.813
Starting to look like something.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.607
Hey there.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.820
Hey. Is that the,
uh, notorious knee brace

21:18.861 --> 21:20.363
from when he T-boned
Crate and Barrel?

21:20.405 --> 21:21.864
(chuckles) Fucking Powers.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.534
-Kamikaze behind the wheel.
-(chuckles)

21:24.575 --> 21:26.703
I'm not saying
he milked it, but, uh...

21:26.744 --> 21:29.122
-But?
-Well, I mean,
he's limping around here

21:29.163 --> 21:31.916
for months like he's
Walter Brennan, you know?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.501
Wagon Train?

21:33.543 --> 21:37.714
Red River.
Wagon Train was Ward Bond.

21:37.755 --> 21:38.881
Oh, right.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.050
Don't blame Powers
for pulling the plug.

21:41.092 --> 21:42.677
He got lucky this time.
Nearly nicked

21:42.719 --> 21:45.138
-his femoral artery.
-Cop life turns on a dime.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.433
Sergeant Edgewood.
Hey, Mank, how's it going?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.643
Well, you ever walk barefoot
on Bubble Wrap?

21:50.685 --> 21:53.980
-Yeah. That kind of crazy fun.
-(chuckles)

21:54.022 --> 21:55.106
You got a minute?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.691
Yeah.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.571
Operation Safe Sidewalks?

22:01.612 --> 22:03.906
-The homeless thing.
-The chief's homeless thing.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.533
I'm running it here at Division.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.076
Nice. Congrats, L.T.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.287
Yeah. I'm looking for
a number two.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.039
Um, somebody with experience
on the street,

22:11.080 --> 22:12.248
especially narcotics.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.208
Like a sergeant level.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.377
Fluent in Hollywood.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.338
Know anybody like that?

22:20.673 --> 22:23.676
(exhales)
I might.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.803
You think he might
be interested?

22:25.845 --> 22:29.015
It's a big change.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.309
Well, make sure he understands
it's a chance to build something

22:31.350 --> 22:32.727
from the ground up.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.856
I will. Lieutenant.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.079
(quietly):
Hey.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.580
Yeah?
(clears throat)

22:52.622 --> 22:55.041
Irving goes into that
Beto Frank interview,

22:55.083 --> 22:57.001
an L.T. marking time
in narcotics.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.879
Six months later, he's in RHD

22:59.921 --> 23:02.340
on a fast track to command.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.343
Guess who was Special Operations
assistant chief at the time?

23:05.384 --> 23:08.262
I don't need to guess,
I remember: Bill Frank.

23:08.304 --> 23:12.391
You think that opportunity
jump passes the smell test?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.519
(sighs)

23:14.560 --> 23:16.979
Irving would've
got there anyway.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.981
One way or another.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.568
Look, it's not like cronyism

23:22.610 --> 23:25.279
isn't baked into
the department's DNA.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.031
He made the right call
at the time.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.533
Look at Beto Frank's record.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.993
If he'd been nipped in the bud,

23:31.035 --> 23:33.204
department would've lost
a good cop.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.539
I know.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.291
Still, the optics suck.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.127
(sighs)

23:39.168 --> 23:41.712
The chief can't take
a political hit like this,

23:41.754 --> 23:44.882
-not now.
-No.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.385
Tell her...

23:47.426 --> 23:50.221
your cassette player
ate the tape?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.395
I can't do that.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.398
-(quietly): Fuck.
-Yeah. Fuck.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.151
We looked into the Clayton case
'cause most of the details

24:03.192 --> 24:04.777
matched the Backseat Butcher.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.654
How many holdbacks did you have?

24:06.696 --> 24:09.866
Two. One was a splash
of pig's blood

24:09.907 --> 24:11.617
-outside the car...
-And the other?

24:11.659 --> 24:14.287
Symbol, drawn on a nearby wall.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.414
-In the victim's blood.
-Yours, too?

24:25.882 --> 24:28.801
-Like a diamond, with legs.
-Mm-hmm.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.346
It's a rune-- signifies
inheritance and heritage.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.015
The Nazis used it.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.558
What'd it mean for the Butcher?

24:35.600 --> 24:36.767
Who knows?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.769
Maybe he just liked
signing his kills with it.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.771
Daisy Clayton
was working a badger game

24:40.813 --> 24:42.064
with her boyfriend.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.025
Could one of her johns
have known about the holdbacks?

24:45.443 --> 24:47.778
Not unless he was part
of my task force.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.530
-You vet your team?
-Yeah.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.699
All my guys volunteered
for a polygraph.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.492
They all passed.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.996
You lifted a print off her skin.
A-a partial.

24:57.038 --> 24:59.081
Yeah. Off her cheek.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.875
It was still a new process,
experimental.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.501
Wouldn't hold up in court.

25:02.543 --> 25:06.172
Everything indicates
he wore gloves, used a condom.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.925
This shrink from
behavioral science,

25:08.966 --> 25:11.510
her take was
he took off a glove,

25:11.552 --> 25:14.472
held the vic's mouth
when he slashed her throat.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.891
Like he wanted to feel
her last breath.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.688
Sick fucks, both of 'em.

25:24.482 --> 25:28.402
However I can help you to catch
this copycat, let me know.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.330
So how are things with Avril?

25:39.372 --> 25:41.082
You tell me.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.333
He's a sly one.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.918
So are you.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.629
I'm doing the best I can.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.965
You ain't doing shit.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.635
That him talking?

25:52.677 --> 25:55.638
I need the Jakes who killed
Marcos and Arias.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.724
-Man, I been digging!
-Dig deeper.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.602
And do it quick.
Or I pull the plug on you.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.274
You need me.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.317
You got that backwards, bro.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.321
We done here? I got a date.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.406
Winston?

26:15.449 --> 26:16.492
Done.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.288
Clock is ticking.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.582
Yeah, I hear that.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.588
(engine starts)

26:30.840 --> 26:32.800
(tires screeching)

26:34.885 --> 26:38.139
MADDIE:
Last year, when I interned
at the D.A.'s office,

26:38.180 --> 26:41.726
there was a cold case
that got reopened.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.147
CIU claimed that my dad
had planted evidence.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.732
I don't see your father
doing that.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.693
That's a line he wouldn't cross.
Ever.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.990
But I did.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.120
You planted evidence?

27:01.162 --> 27:03.998
I crossed a line.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.584
I snooped through a file
on somebody's desk.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.128
Saw a letter about my dad.
I took a picture of it.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.923
-I sent it to his lawyer.
-(chuckles)

27:12.965 --> 27:14.383
Honey Chandler.

27:16.177 --> 27:19.722
Whoa. That's complicated.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.557
Please don't say karma.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.809
Never crossed my mind.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.813
Crossed mine.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.818
I wouldn't call it karma.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.820
What would you call it?

27:34.862 --> 27:37.490
Just plain old
conflict of interest.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.618
(chuckles) Hey.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.330
Look, it's nothing
to beat yourself up about.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.803
This is the latest ATF inventory
of Charlie Dax's guns.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.262
Done five years ago.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.680
The one in yellow:

28:01.722 --> 28:03.474
Smith & Wesson M&P Shield.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.267
Same caliber as the gun
that killed Craver.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.229
This is a recent FBI inventory
of his weapons.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.107
Done after the shoot-out
at the Strout house.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.441
So, no Smith & Wesson Shield.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.236
No. Could've sold it
in the interim.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.363
No sales receipt?

28:17.405 --> 28:19.365
What about the DNA
on Craver's shirt?

28:19.407 --> 28:23.119
-Still waiting.
-Well, lost, stolen or sold,

28:23.160 --> 28:24.537
he's required to report it.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.122
I'm sure he has
a good explanation.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.581
Let's hear it.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.377
(knocking)

28:33.337 --> 28:34.797
Mrs. Dax? Detective Bosch.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.842
Detective Edgar, LAPD.
Is your husband home?

28:37.883 --> 28:41.512
Charlie, cops.
What do you want to do?

28:41.554 --> 28:43.389
DAX:
Tell you what
I don't want to do.

28:43.431 --> 28:45.599
Give them any excuses.
Let them in.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.814
Thank you.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.528
You gonna show me a warrant,
like you did Waylon?

28:57.570 --> 29:00.281
Just want to ask you a few
questions about your inventory.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.493
Guns are in the garage.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.537
Feds did a whole new inventory
the other day,

29:06.579 --> 29:08.539
after they killed
my brother-in-law.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.332
They didn't send you a copy?

29:13.043 --> 29:14.170
(beeping)

29:17.298 --> 29:18.757
You ever use a burner phone?

29:20.426 --> 29:23.846
Have I ever purchased a legal,
prepaid phone? Yes.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.186
Look familiar?

29:30.227 --> 29:32.062
I got sent that picture
out of the blue.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.773
Thought it was a prank.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.776
Had no idea who the guy
with Craver was.

29:37.818 --> 29:41.322
Then at the nursery,
there he is.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.616
Fucking Fed in my face.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.242
Special Agent Cliff Maxwell.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.328
Craver really his snitch?

29:47.369 --> 29:48.829
He was.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.499
Show this picture to anyone?

29:51.540 --> 29:54.210
No. And when I found out
Craver was dead,

29:54.251 --> 29:56.879
I deleted it.
What'd you want to see?

29:56.921 --> 29:58.964
Smith & Wesson M&P Shield.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.966
(laughs softly)

30:01.008 --> 30:03.844
You know I don't have it.

30:03.886 --> 30:06.180
Came up missing after the Feds
did their "inventory."

30:06.222 --> 30:07.848
What a surprise.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.351
-You didn't report it.
-Didn't see the fucking point.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.936
The point is, it's the law.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.688
Your law. Not mine.

30:14.730 --> 30:18.150
-Maxwell lead the search party?
-What do you think?

30:20.194 --> 30:22.780
You gonna say that Craver
was killed

30:22.821 --> 30:26.742
with the Smith & fucking Wesson
that you people took from me?

30:26.784 --> 30:27.952
That I did it?

30:27.993 --> 30:30.496
No. We're done.

30:30.538 --> 30:34.959
This... this has been bullshit
from start to finish.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.086
None of this has anything
to do with me.

30:37.127 --> 30:41.257
Or the Strouts or the
Three Oh Eight sovereigns.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.885
You want to know why
we're so pissed

30:44.927 --> 30:46.554
at the state of the government?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.557
Look in the fucking mirror.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.356
Maxwell set him up.

30:57.398 --> 30:59.358
Why steal the Smith & Wesson
during the search?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.985
Last piece of the puzzle.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.446
Disappear the gun,
puts Dax looking guiltier.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.740
(knocking on window)

31:13.163 --> 31:16.041
I am somewhat surprised
you agreed to meet with me.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.877
How could I pass up
the opportunity?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.297
For what?

31:22.339 --> 31:24.174
To find out why you'd trade

31:24.216 --> 31:26.427
one of the most powerful jobs
in Los Angeles

31:26.468 --> 31:29.930
to be mostly miserable
in City Hall.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.225
(sighs)

31:33.267 --> 31:36.228
So much of what I do now
involves cleaning up the mess

31:36.270 --> 31:37.855
politicians create
with their policies.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.398
Save me the stump speech.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.900
All right.

31:41.942 --> 31:43.736
But it's the truth.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.904
Chief, I hope you win.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.990
I look forward to your successor

31:48.032 --> 31:50.326
taking LAPD back
to the old ways,

31:50.367 --> 31:52.703
when my business thrived.

31:55.331 --> 31:58.167
I think my reforms will stand.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.837
If you honestly believe

32:01.879 --> 32:04.923
you can accomplish more as mayor
than you can as chief...

32:04.965 --> 32:06.884
-I do.
-...I'll endorse that.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.886
And you.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.722
Hell, I'll even write
a check to your campaign.

32:11.764 --> 32:12.848
You will?

32:13.891 --> 32:15.726
Absolutely.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.228
What's the catch?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.441
No catch.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.171
Detective Vega. Come in.

32:44.213 --> 32:46.215
Close the door.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.809
I heard there might be
a problem.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.019
Lieutenant Billets?

32:59.061 --> 33:00.646
No, sir. Not with me.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.356
L.T.'s great. Ask anybody.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.734
Asking you. Heard she
made you uncomfortable.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.363
That would be
an overstatement, sir.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.157
Afraid of blowback, Detective?

33:12.199 --> 33:13.701
Department has your back.

33:13.742 --> 33:14.910
No, sir, really, I...

33:14.952 --> 33:16.412
Will go no further
than this room.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.580
Anything you say.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.624
You have my word.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.088
I may have vented,
to my partner.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.924
I've been having
some personal issues and, uh,

33:28.966 --> 33:30.968
I may have overreacted.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.804
Home front. Always a pickle.

33:35.556 --> 33:38.809
Well. Long as you've got
a handle on it.

33:38.851 --> 33:42.563
I do, sir. I'm sorry
if anyone misunderstood.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.357
Glad we could talk.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.610
Now go solve a case or two.

33:49.987 --> 33:52.322
Or three.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.171
(knocking on door)

34:07.212 --> 34:08.589
Yeah?

34:10.966 --> 34:13.552
-You got a sec?
-Oh, of course.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.393
Alicia Kent?

34:21.435 --> 34:23.854
Yes.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.856
Look, Maddie,
different cases are sequestered

34:25.898 --> 34:29.026
-in law offices all the time.
-I know.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.196
But given what I did for you
last year

34:32.237 --> 34:35.032
while on my dad's case,
I think it's gonna be awkward

34:35.073 --> 34:38.452
having me around
while he's on the other side.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.122
You're sure?

34:42.164 --> 34:44.374
Yeah.

34:46.543 --> 34:50.130
I'm disappointed,
but I understand.

34:55.052 --> 34:58.222
Thanks. For everything.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.057
Absolutely.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.977
Hey, you change your mind,
you're welcome back any time.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.655
(door closes)

35:14.696 --> 35:18.075
Plans for the night?
Or monk-like solitude?

35:18.116 --> 35:21.078
(chuckles)
More like Thelonious Monk. You?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.329
(computer chimes)

35:24.873 --> 35:26.500
Jerry.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.171
DNA from Craver's shirt.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.425
Saliva.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.018
Travis Strout.

35:45.060 --> 35:48.647
Strout killed Craver.
Then spit on him.

35:48.689 --> 35:50.858
What you do to a snitch.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.693
Dax lied about not showing
the other sovereigns

35:52.734 --> 35:55.529
the picture
that Maxwell sent him.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.781
And Travis Strout took the bait.

36:01.535 --> 36:04.872
I can't decide. Bob Mitchum?

36:04.913 --> 36:07.082
-Or Bogart and Bacall?
-(growls)

36:08.125 --> 36:09.918
Mitchum. Excellent choice.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.796
-(phone ringing)
-That's a very underrated actor.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.967
You know, Mitchum put
the "L" in "laconic."

36:17.009 --> 36:19.177
-Hello.
-MELISSA: Hi, Barrel.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.762
Melissa Rodgers.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.348
-How you holding up?
-Okay. You know.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.975
I do.

36:25.017 --> 36:28.270
I was curious
what's on that tape.

36:28.312 --> 36:30.272
It was nothing.

36:30.314 --> 36:34.026
It was in his safe deposit.
It must be something.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.111
Well, maybe at the time
he put it in there,

36:36.153 --> 36:40.991
but trust me, Melissa,
now he'd want you to let it go.

36:41.033 --> 36:45.037
Okay, well,
should I come pick it up,

36:45.078 --> 36:47.164
or can you drop it in the mail?

36:47.205 --> 36:50.584
You know, I checked on
your dad's transfer to Pacific.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.712
He did put in
for that midnight shift.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.756
Chief had nothing
to do with that.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.800
If you say so.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.136
Tape's got my father's voice
on it, Barrel.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.930
I'd like it back.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.973
Sure.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.352
(muffled dance music pulsing)

37:11.605 --> 37:13.607
WINSTON:
Bad news.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.569
How's that?

37:17.611 --> 37:20.113
(sighs)
Felix Mariama?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.573
DEA.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.039
Real name is Charlie Hovan.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.711
And you brought him to us.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.296
I just learned it.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.979
"Just"?

37:52.020 --> 37:54.606
You're walking into a trap.

37:54.648 --> 37:57.526
That you helped devise.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.239
Why I'm telling you now.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.719
WAYLON:
Fucking federal bug.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.558
What do you want me
to do with it?

38:29.599 --> 38:31.309
Uh, put it on the truck.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.443
(sighs)

38:39.484 --> 38:41.486
So, what are you gonna do?

38:43.321 --> 38:46.908
I'm gonna lay low for a while.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.370
Gonna mourn my man.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.581
And then I'll decide.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.332
You sure I can't help?

38:55.542 --> 38:57.919
I got somebody else.

38:57.961 --> 39:00.672
It was my brother they murdered.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.717
And why they'll look
at you first.

39:11.558 --> 39:12.976
KLEIN:
E-mails, calendars, text files.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.187
-I sent you a packet.
-Any names?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.355
Screen names, aliases.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.775
You know, e-mail addresses that
are probably no good anymore.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.985
Sands said there was
photos and videos.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.403
Still working on that.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.864
-Roots are all fucked up.
-ETA?

39:25.906 --> 39:27.282
Soon as I can.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.910
-How long?
-Weeks, not months.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.411
Just as long
as they're not corrupted.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.704
Making my day.

39:32.746 --> 39:35.207
That's me. Mr. Sunshine.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.501
Thanks, amigo.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.510
Hey.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.764
You're gonna be
seeing more of me.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.975
I'm not complaining, but why?

39:56.269 --> 39:57.687
I quit today.

39:59.481 --> 40:02.067
Too awkward.

40:02.109 --> 40:04.111
I don't blame you.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.906
She said I'm welcome back
any time.

40:07.948 --> 40:10.033
She's a good judge of character.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.369
With everyone she deals with,
she has to be.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.330
I was wondering how long
you'd be okay with that part.

40:15.372 --> 40:17.332
Which part?

40:17.374 --> 40:19.167
You mean defending people
like Dante Crow?

40:19.209 --> 40:20.377
Okay, Mads, look.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.671
Everyone deserves a defense,

40:22.712 --> 40:24.881
but she helps guys like Crow
game the system.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.843
If the system is rigged,
someone has to.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.970
Come on, Mads.
You sound so cynical.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.930
