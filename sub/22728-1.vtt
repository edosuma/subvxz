00:37.720 --> 00:40.554
<i>Remember when we used</i>
<i>to play in the woods together?</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:50.237
<i>I got lost that one summer.</i>

00:53.440 --> 00:56.558
<i>When I turned around, you were gone.</i>

01:07.720 --> 01:12.875
<i>When they found me,
I almost didn't want to come back.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:49.952
Are you sure you want to do this?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.959
I don't think...

03:07.560 --> 03:09.950
I could go through with this...

03:14.920 --> 03:16.115
without you.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.799
Keith said it won't hurt.

09:37.000 --> 09:37.990
Thanks.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.115
Can't say we didn't try.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.359
- <i># Guiding light, guiding light #</i>
- Yeah.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.437
Somebody's gotta get
outta here before midnight.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.036
Yeah, you better.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.276
Walt?

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
Walt!

10:20.040 --> 10:21.520
It ate my money again.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.430
Shit.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.472
Shit, shit.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.074
Another round?

10:31.160 --> 10:35.040
<i># The roaring shells #</i>

10:38.160 --> 10:42.313
<i># The drifting of the leaves #</i>

10:45.480 --> 10:47.915
- <i># But all intent #</i>
- Looks like you're celebrating.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.039
I got promoted.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.156
Theresa mentioned you guys
needed some extra cash.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.398
She even begged me to pick up
some work after hours.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.071
Great.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.510
Okay.

11:12.240 --> 11:17.918
<i># Never again to face this night #</i>

11:18.440 --> 11:19.556
Don't mind if I do.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.553
<i># Guiding light #</i>

11:21.840 --> 11:23.911
Hey, Keith. Not tonight, man.

11:25.080 --> 11:29.518
<i># Guide me through these nights #</i>

12:01.440 --> 12:02.396
You read my mind.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.152
I didn't get a chance
to leave the house today.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.159
You unpacked everything.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.070
Almost.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.871
I'll probably take a
few more days to clean...

12:13.560 --> 12:14.914
Move things around.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.912
They're picking up my mom's things tomorrow.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.631
Hey, we could get our own place.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.274
She wanted us here.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.596
She told me.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.357
I found the money you have hiding.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.191
It's...

13:28.320 --> 13:30.118
You don't need to worry about that.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.114
I spoke with Rick.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.674
I'll be getting paid more.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.999
I'm not worried about you taking care of us.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.680
I got permission to take down that old
growth that's been holding up everything.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.511
We haven't cut something that big...

13:54.360 --> 13:56.158
At least not since I been working there.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.349
Longer hours, though.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.714
Do you ever regret it?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.478
Cutting everything down?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.396
Sometimes.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.359
<i>Theresa, it's Keith.</i>

15:25.520 --> 15:27.352
<i>I ran into Nick last night.</i>

15:28.280 --> 15:29.350
<i>It was, uh...</i>

15:31.280 --> 15:32.839
<i>Hey, when are you gonna come back to work?</i>

15:35.160 --> 15:36.435
<i>It's not the same without you.</i>

16:02.240 --> 16:04.435
I was...

16:04.520 --> 16:06.512
...I was really fucked up.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.877
Some fucking idiot put a ton of money into
the machine just before me...

16:12.560 --> 16:13.835
I tried calling you.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.556
Did you hear me?

16:17.680 --> 16:19.399
Hey. Theresa?

16:32.720 --> 16:35.440
<i># We're in the building
where they make us grow #</i>

16:35.520 --> 16:36.874
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey, man.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.191
<i># Like you #</i>

16:40.280 --> 16:41.760
Let me know if I can help you, all right?

16:43.480 --> 16:44.755
What is this, can I have these?

16:45.880 --> 16:49.157
This is the home brew. It's magical.

16:49.880 --> 16:50.791
Nice.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.240
You okay?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.232
<i># Like you #</i>

16:57.560 --> 16:59.597
- Want to smell that?
- Yeah, sure.

17:02.840 --> 17:03.876
Please don't touch it.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.751
Yeah.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.394
All right. I gotta see your card.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.233
<i># Plug me in and turn me on #</i>

17:22.680 --> 17:24.512
<i># Oh, everything is moving #</i>

18:07.280 --> 18:08.270
It's kind of weird, but...

18:10.880 --> 18:12.712
Sometimes you look like your mom.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.478
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Ed.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.750
How are things?

20:20.440 --> 20:21.760
Ah, getting lots done.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.431
Pretty.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.831
Thanks.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.997
You know, this used to be a flower shop.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.400
Yeah?

20:38.480 --> 20:41.996
My wife bought the flowers
for our wedding here.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.873
Oh.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.954
It's gonna be fine, man.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.470
Ed...

20:55.680 --> 20:56.716
it won't hurt.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.950
It won't hurt.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.630
Can't hurt any more than it already does.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.874
So, whether I'm ready or not,
it's gotta happen now.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.710
Okay.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.753
How's Theresa?

21:24.840 --> 21:27.480
I haven't seen her since her mom passed.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.149
Oh, she's fine.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.710
She's just, you know, Theresa.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.714
She's gonna come by later.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.038
- Take it easy, man.
- All right.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.155
No free joint?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.075
- Not tonight, man.
- All right, all right.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.839
You know what, Ed?

21:51.760 --> 21:52.830
Don't smoke it.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.596
You're a smart-ass, but I love you.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.870
Hello?

22:50.040 --> 22:52.032
It's a little late in the day
to show up for work.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.236
Yeah.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.077
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.193
Yeah, it's cool.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.752
Hey, you want to come by Mike's tonight?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.114
Lighten the mood a little?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.553
Mike's?

23:07.640 --> 23:09.313
I didn't know he was back.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.719
Come on. Please.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.754
Come on.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.320
I don't know, I...

23:20.480 --> 23:21.960
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.718
You're not seriously gonna let
me have all the fun, are you?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.516
So you can go back to your mom's house alone?

23:29.560 --> 23:30.630
Come on.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.513
Everyone would be so excited to see you.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.830
Baby steps?

24:04.920 --> 24:06.240
It's gonna be fun.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.230
What's up, ladies?

24:19.320 --> 24:20.879
Hey.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.189
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey, man.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.317
- Good. Where's the kids?
- Inside.

24:27.000 --> 24:27.956
Kids?

24:29.640 --> 24:30.835
It's Uncle Keith!

24:32.840 --> 24:33.830
Boys?

24:34.760 --> 24:35.910
You gotta make me rich!

24:36.800 --> 24:38.632
Rar! Come outside!

24:38.720 --> 24:42.760
- Rar!
- Yes! Yes!

24:42.840 --> 24:45.719
- Are you gonna make us rich today?
- Yes!

24:45.800 --> 24:47.678
- You know the game, right?
- Yes!

24:47.840 --> 24:49.160
You got 30 seconds?

24:50.160 --> 24:51.355
One, two...

24:52.160 --> 24:54.152
Oh, where'd it go?

24:54.880 --> 24:56.360
Where's the money?

24:56.680 --> 24:57.830
It's here!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.719
I'm gonna have some kids one day.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.797
But first I need to find a lady.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.270
Good luck with that.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.309
- Hi.
- Johnny?

25:23.400 --> 25:24.720
Keith.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.272
Oh, what's up, baby?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.718
- You good?
- Yeah.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.154
You want a drink or something?

25:34.240 --> 25:37.312
Yeah. What have you got here?

25:37.400 --> 25:40.154
- Got some glasses?
- Yeah, just, uh...

25:40.240 --> 25:43.153
- Theresa, you want some?
- No.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.197
What do you want? Whiskey?

25:45.280 --> 25:46.191
You want some whiskey?

25:47.080 --> 25:49.072
- I want to have some. Do you?
- Yeah.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.077
- Dude.
- Awesome.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.116
So what happened?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.672
Um, wait.

25:59.840 --> 26:00.751
Just...

26:01.200 --> 26:04.318
What? Huh?

26:05.840 --> 26:07.638
- You're fucked up.
- Yeah.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.915
You're fucked up.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.756
Whoa, look at that view.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.960
Ladies.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.314
You know, I'm...

27:00.280 --> 27:03.079
I'm really sorry about your mom.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.354
Keith told me what happened.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.839
Have you been with any of them?

27:28.840 --> 27:31.309
Yeah, some of them.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.477
But, uh, not... not really.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.314
Do you like any of them?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.150
No.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.876
Johnny?

27:54.320 --> 27:55.436
Yeah?

27:55.560 --> 27:57.392
You wanna come down and light some candles?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.880
Uh, no, I'm all right, man.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.560
They're birthday candles. Theresa?

28:04.560 --> 28:06.040
Have your own birthday.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.910
All right. Okay.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.392
My birthday. That's cool.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.113
Thanks, Keith.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.270
You're welcome.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.634
Make a wish.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.480
We can do it together.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.474
Oh.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.112
I got two girls who want
to suck our cocks, man.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.476
- Come on. Seriously.
- Oh...

28:54.520 --> 28:57.240
- Look. Maybe two and a half.
- Yeah.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.913
- Maybe you want to take two.
- Go for it.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.150
Sounds good, man.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.275
Come on!

29:02.360 --> 29:04.238
You need a little cock-sucking.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.356
All right. All right.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.159
I missed you.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.631
I'm sure you survived just fine.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.155
Listen, um,

29:49.760 --> 29:51.479
I know this is not great timing.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.320
But, uh, Ed came in today.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.310
How is he?

29:59.440 --> 30:00.430
He's sick.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.670
He needs us.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.435
He asked about you, and I was just...

30:10.200 --> 30:11.350
I, um...

30:13.680 --> 30:15.672
Do you think you can
go through with it again?

36:28.600 --> 36:29.511
Hey.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.992
Hey, Johnny.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.911
Uh, that was fun the other night.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.550
Here you go.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.750
Thanks.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.437
When did, uh, Keith get the roses?

36:49.960 --> 36:50.950
I don't know.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.079
Are you coming out again this weekend?

36:55.640 --> 36:59.077
I don't know. Nick doesn't like
to go out too much, so...

36:59.440 --> 37:00.430
All right.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.753
There'll be, uh...
probably be another one, I'm sure.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.430
All right. Thanks.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.591
I sent you some artwork last week.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.071
Did you get it?

37:23.720 --> 37:24.915
Yes.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.075
I will...

37:49.480 --> 37:53.110
see you... around.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.955
<i>Hey, man, I'm not home. See you in the shop.</i>

38:59.200 --> 39:00.111
Hmm.

39:01.880 --> 39:02.836
Hmm?

39:03.880 --> 39:04.870
Hmm?

39:05.560 --> 39:06.471
Mm-mm.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.074
Goddamn it.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.950
How was your day?

41:26.000 --> 41:26.990
Fine.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.114
There's nothing in the fridge.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.029
Johnny?

41:46.640 --> 41:47.630
Yeah.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.870
Okay.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.632
Fifteens...

42:01.240 --> 42:02.754
Wow.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.071
Twenty-two, man. You lost again.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.711
Just a royal... fucking...

42:13.120 --> 42:15.237
- Blackjack.
- Blackjack.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.912
Twenty-one!

42:18.000 --> 42:19.036
Oh!

42:20.960 --> 42:22.838
No, but like, you can't beat all of these.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.274
I just did! I just did!

42:24.400 --> 42:25.356
I'm the bank!

42:25.480 --> 42:26.834
- Yeah, but...
- Twenty-one.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.718
Okay, but how many times did I...

42:28.800 --> 42:30.757
- Doesn't mean... It doesn't mean shit, man.
- Before you...

42:30.840 --> 42:33.753
Because I got 21. I got 21.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.958
You got 21, but it wasn't my 21.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.835
That's cool, but it's not enough.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.913
Okay, no. We need to shuffle this deck.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.280
How did things roll with Ed?

43:39.160 --> 43:40.071
Fine.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.390
I was...

43:43.120 --> 43:46.272
Listen, I understand.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.400
I... I get you don't want to talk about it.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.270
I don't want to talk about it.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.798
How long have we known each other, Keith?

43:56.440 --> 43:57.794
Depends.

43:59.240 --> 44:00.435
You know what I mean.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.314
Fair enough. I'll leave that alone.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.510
Yeah?

44:25.880 --> 44:27.473
Something's wrong with this.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.510
Theresa?

44:38.040 --> 44:39.520
There's something wrong with this.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.390
I don't know what happened.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.629
Johnny's dead.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.276
Johnny died, and...

46:11.320 --> 46:15.155
I just don't know how...

46:15.240 --> 46:16.993
Keith, I...

46:19.120 --> 46:20.236
I...

46:21.400 --> 46:22.629
I'm sorry. I...

46:23.240 --> 46:25.311
None of that means shit now, so...

46:26.160 --> 46:27.560
Just tell me what you did.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.038
What do you mean, what did I do?

46:32.120 --> 46:33.315
What do I mean?

46:33.400 --> 46:36.074
First Ed, now Johnny. They...

46:37.080 --> 46:38.992
They both came in that day.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.080
Both of them came into the shop the same day.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.879
It's not a fucking coincidence.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.630
I...

46:50.200 --> 46:51.520
Your alarm went off.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.040
You went to work. Then what?

46:56.200 --> 46:57.600
What happened?

46:57.680 --> 46:59.114
I didn't do anything.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.350
Just think!

47:01.040 --> 47:04.512
Could you just think for one fucking second
and tell me what the fuck you did?

47:07.120 --> 47:09.589
Jesus, Theresa,
just tell me the fucking truth!

47:09.720 --> 47:11.279
Fuck you! I didn't do anything!

47:11.360 --> 47:13.158
But something happened!

47:13.240 --> 47:15.197
What do you want me to say?

47:20.360 --> 47:22.397
You understand that we...

47:22.480 --> 47:27.555
we can't tell anyone anything, ever, right?

47:29.760 --> 47:31.274
Right?

47:31.640 --> 47:34.235
Everyone knows that Johnny
was into all sorts of shit.

47:36.080 --> 47:36.957
You know that.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.120
Promise me.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.151
Yeah.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.399
Where were you?

50:06.720 --> 50:07.756
Nowhere.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.394
I couldn't sleep.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.394
Were you with someone?

50:33.440 --> 50:35.159
It's not about that.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.350
What's it about?

55:43.920 --> 55:45.036
Ugh!

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.879
Here you go.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.960
Theresa?

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.440
Theresa, wake up.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.917
I can't sleep in this house.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.993
<i>I used to love this flower.</i>

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.470
You're gonna have to take
better care of yourself.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.836
Ugh!

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.871
What did you do?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.753
You think I did this?

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.634
Look at you.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.032
Look at what you did out there.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.712
I'm not cleaning it up for you.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.071
Nick?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.437
<i>I wish. You two have a fight?</i>

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.993
What do you want?

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.999
<i>Go to Perry's, all right?</i>

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.078
<i>I could use some company.</i>

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.997
I can't leave right now.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.838
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.480
What did you do, Theresa?

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.994
What did you do?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.034
Theresa?

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.112
I need to tell you something.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.560
I killed Johnny...

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.436
instead of you.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:34.116
What do you mean... instead of me?

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.714
Did he ask you?

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.076
No.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.393
You killed him?

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.396
Ed?

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.790
Ed?

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.195
Ed? Ed?

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.752
You need to tell me where you've been.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.756
- Theresa, you...
- Don't touch me!

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.437
- You make me sick!
- What?

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.830
- Theresa, come here. Theresa, come here.
- Get out! Get out!

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.912
- Come on.
- Get out of here!

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.629
I don't want to hurt you.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.873
Shit, Theresa. Come in.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.550
Do you want some water?

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.675
Feel better?

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.115
Come on. Come on.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.351
Come on.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.598
Now sit.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.873
Has Nick seen you like this?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.070
Don't call him.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.435
What happened?

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.756
Nothing.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:34.951
Hey...

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.035
it looks like more than nothing.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.470
You told him.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.796
You fucking told him.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.633
Why can't you say it?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.713
Why can't you say it?

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.911
We helped kill her! We killed her!

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.832
Why? Why?

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.876
And what? And what, huh?

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.717
What do you want me to say?
That it's my fault?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.516
Is that it?

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.110
That it's my fault?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.474
Okay.

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.070
Don't.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.070
Don't! Don't!

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.600
Stay! Stay!

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.995
We'll figure it out, all right?

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.156
Don't call him.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.475
- Don't call him.
- Stop it.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.111
Put it down. Please?

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.311
Theresa?
