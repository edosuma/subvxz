<font color="#fffc00">"This Is Us"...</font>

00:01.942 --> 00:03.350
First day of summer.
We don't want to be

00:03.434 --> 00:04.927
the last ones in the pool.

00:05.726 --> 00:07.977
All right, gang, it's time
to get the hell out of here.

00:08.271 --> 00:09.272
How?

00:09.812 --> 00:10.890
We climb.

00:11.338 --> 00:13.335
You need to end it, Malik.

00:13.938 --> 00:15.140
You need to do it for her.

00:15.225 --> 00:16.648
What? I'm not gonna...

00:17.257 --> 00:19.250
- I love her.
- If you really love her, man,

00:19.335 --> 00:21.687
then you will do
what is best for her.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.967
He's acting so weird.

00:24.202 --> 00:26.071
He hasn't texted all morning.

00:27.534 --> 00:29.886
Senator Gamble's office
keeps calling.

00:29.971 --> 00:32.515
He saw the article
in The Philadelphia Local

00:32.600 --> 00:34.085
and sends his regards.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.172
Tell the senator I have to call
the old fart back

00:36.257 --> 00:37.397
after the holiday.

00:37.482 --> 00:40.185
REBECCA: In the event
that Miguel, God forbid,

00:40.270 --> 00:42.689
is not here to make
those decisions for me,

00:42.773 --> 00:44.734
I'm gonna need one of you
to stand in for him.

00:44.984 --> 00:46.304
Kate,

00:47.095 --> 00:48.279
I want it to be you.

00:48.511 --> 00:50.080
[♪]

00:55.819 --> 00:57.169
Come on, guys. Come on.

00:57.253 --> 00:58.570
First day of summer.

00:58.654 --> 01:00.206
We don't want to be
the last ones in the pool.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.619
And you know what Mom
and Dad have for you guys.

01:01.703 --> 01:02.265
Oh!

01:02.350 --> 01:03.766
- Swim goggles!
- Swim goggles!

01:03.851 --> 01:06.012
- I want one!
- Chairs, chairs, chairs, chairs.

01:06.096 --> 01:07.880
REBECCA:
Hey, Bug, you want some goggles?

01:07.964 --> 01:09.682
KEVIN: I want to go off
the diving board.

01:09.766 --> 01:11.050
JACK: Don't you think you ought
to learn how to,

01:11.134 --> 01:12.885
- you know, swim first?
- REBECCA: Yeah, bud.

01:12.969 --> 01:14.821
I know you didn't like
taking your swim lessons,

01:14.905 --> 01:16.322
but they sure helped
your brother

01:16.406 --> 01:18.490
learn how to swim at the Y.

01:18.574 --> 01:20.592
KATE: That girl is swimming
upside down.

01:20.676 --> 01:21.593
REBECCA:
No. (Chuckles)

01:21.677 --> 01:23.429
She's doing the backstroke.

01:23.513 --> 01:25.898
And you would have learned how
to do that, too, if you stayed

01:25.982 --> 01:27.266
in class at the Y.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.515
There's Mr. Mike!
Can I go see him?

01:29.600 --> 01:32.156
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Good luck.

01:32.274 --> 01:34.192
Actually, Randall, come here.

01:34.277 --> 01:35.750
Hey, hey, hey.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.944
So, um, I know
that your brother and sister

01:39.029 --> 01:41.280
didn't take to swimming
as fast as you did.

01:41.364 --> 01:44.688
And... I don't know,
I just had this whole idea of us

01:44.773 --> 01:45.992
swimming here together.

01:46.077 --> 01:48.414
But... maybe next summer.

01:48.529 --> 01:49.890
Yeah?

01:51.650 --> 01:53.568
Okay. Go get 'em, champ!

01:53.653 --> 01:55.038
- Go, go.
- JACK: Hey, you, uh...

01:55.145 --> 01:56.929
- you got Kate?
- REBECCA: Yeah. I got Kate.

01:57.014 --> 01:58.257
RANDALL:
I'm here, I'm here!

01:58.342 --> 02:00.530
- Don't start without me!
- (chuckles) I wouldn't dream

02:00.615 --> 02:01.968
of starting
without my star student.

02:02.052 --> 02:02.914
Up top!

02:03.098 --> 02:04.098
(both imitating bubbling)

02:04.287 --> 02:05.321
(chuckles)

02:05.704 --> 02:07.867
All right, troops. Now,

02:08.078 --> 02:11.160
you five have rocked it
all summer at the Y.

02:11.245 --> 02:12.162
Today's the day.

02:12.247 --> 02:13.499
So, how it's gonna go...

02:13.605 --> 02:14.822
First, we're gonna start

02:14.907 --> 02:17.484
with a timed
underwater breathing exercise.

02:17.578 --> 02:20.141
Then you're gonna swim
the whole length of the pool.

02:20.226 --> 02:23.437
Then, after that, you're gonna
tread water for about a minute.

02:23.545 --> 02:27.149
And then we'll finish
floating on our backs and done.

02:27.911 --> 02:29.618
- KATE: Uh-uh. No.
- KEVIN: Okay, hey, look, relax.

02:29.702 --> 02:31.462
- We're gonna try it again.
- No! I can't.

02:31.547 --> 02:33.383
I can't. No.

02:34.442 --> 02:36.460
- (siren whoops)
- (vehicle approaching)

02:36.819 --> 02:38.819
- (brakes squeak)
- (indistinct radio transmission)

02:39.771 --> 02:41.649
(quietly)
Damn it.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.869
We're getting arrested.

02:44.895 --> 02:46.203
Great.

02:47.315 --> 02:49.375
Oh, thank you so much, sir.

02:51.433 --> 02:52.550
Is that beer?

02:53.039 --> 02:54.266
No.

02:54.437 --> 02:55.822
(clanging)

02:56.405 --> 02:57.517
Pick that up.

02:57.602 --> 02:59.138
Yes, sir.

03:03.063 --> 03:04.981
Give me that.

03:05.541 --> 03:07.010
It-it is beer.

03:09.342 --> 03:12.562
All right. So that's illegal
trespassing, underage drinking.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.907
I'd say that you guys are in
for a very unpleasant night.

03:16.634 --> 03:18.179
Wait right here.

03:21.631 --> 03:23.242
This can't be happening.

03:25.608 --> 03:27.774
- Just wait right here. I'll-I'll be right back.
- Randall.

03:27.858 --> 03:28.929
- KEVIN: Hey, hey, hey.
- Randall.

03:29.013 --> 03:30.937
- Don't make it worse.
- I can handle this.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.880
Excuse me, sir?

03:33.965 --> 03:34.882
Whoa.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.134
Just 30 seconds.

03:37.431 --> 03:38.548
REBECCA:
I need you all

03:38.633 --> 03:39.918
to hear my voice right now.

03:40.032 --> 03:41.249
Your mother's voice,

03:41.334 --> 03:43.252
with all of her faculties.

03:43.337 --> 03:44.604
(inhales)

03:45.184 --> 03:48.304
You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

03:49.453 --> 03:51.898
This thing
that's happening to me

03:51.983 --> 03:55.304
will not be the thing
that holds you back.

03:55.498 --> 03:58.039
So, take the risks.

03:58.301 --> 03:59.960
Make the big moves,

04:00.045 --> 04:02.296
even if they're small moves.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.062
Forge ahead with your lives

04:05.147 --> 04:08.333
in any and every direction
that moves you.

04:08.757 --> 04:10.375
I am your mother,

04:11.277 --> 04:12.843
and I'm sick.

04:14.006 --> 04:16.702
And I'm asking you
to be fearless.

04:29.419 --> 04:30.888
(grunts)

04:31.860 --> 04:33.978
(inhales deeply, exhales)

04:34.063 --> 04:36.148
I'm sure
she has her reasons, hon.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.343
No, I know.

04:39.042 --> 04:40.257
And it's Thanksgiving.

04:40.342 --> 04:41.393
Mm?

04:41.490 --> 04:43.007
We knew
there was gonna be drama.

04:43.092 --> 04:45.128
(clicks tongue)
Yeah...

04:46.019 --> 04:47.460
No, it's okay. I get it.

04:47.703 --> 04:49.382
It's just, uh...

04:49.664 --> 04:51.048
It's a lot to process.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.834
- Mm.
- (rapid footsteps approaching)

04:54.098 --> 04:57.578
Wow, I just figured out
why Malik has been being so weird.

04:57.663 --> 04:58.672
Hm.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.883
You told him
to stay away from me?

05:01.312 --> 05:03.429
- Dej...
- He broke up with me.

05:06.210 --> 05:08.085
I literally hate you.

05:08.945 --> 05:10.171
Hey. Deja.

05:10.256 --> 05:11.974
- You don't mean that.
- No, no, I do.

05:12.059 --> 05:13.844
I do. He lied to me.
You lied to me.

05:13.929 --> 05:15.015
How did I lie to you?

05:15.100 --> 05:16.734
You walked around for weeks,

05:16.819 --> 05:18.378
staring in my face,

05:18.463 --> 05:19.713
acting like nothing happened,

05:19.798 --> 05:21.382
when you know what you did.

05:22.167 --> 05:24.820
I didn't think
he would listen to me. Okay?

05:24.905 --> 05:27.072
You kids are notorious
for not listening.

05:27.157 --> 05:29.408
Hey, hey. Why don't we all
just calm down, all right?

05:29.492 --> 05:31.718
It is late.
Emotions are at a ten right now,

05:31.812 --> 05:33.889
and this is a very old house
with very thin walls.

05:33.974 --> 05:35.591
Is everything okay?

05:35.676 --> 05:36.915
We heard yelling.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.849
Case in point.

05:37.933 --> 05:38.929
Um...

05:39.014 --> 05:40.685
just a little family issue.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.921
RANDALL:
Deja, dropping out

05:43.005 --> 05:45.424
of high school to get your GED
and move to Boston

05:45.508 --> 05:47.826
to live with your 18-year-old
single father boyfriend,

05:47.910 --> 05:50.062
that is not good enough for you.

05:50.147 --> 05:52.574
- You deserve better.
- You don't get to decide that.

05:52.659 --> 05:54.432
Well, yeah, I do.
You're my daughter!

05:54.517 --> 05:55.685
No, I'm not!

05:56.738 --> 05:59.023
Tess and Annie
are your daughters.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.921
I'm just some girl
you took from her mom.

06:11.101 --> 06:13.136
[♪]

06:25.981 --> 06:28.618
(birds chirping)

06:29.958 --> 06:32.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.639
Heard you had
a rough night in there.

06:33.723 --> 06:34.648
You all right?

06:34.733 --> 06:37.552
Uh, all part of being the parent
of a teenager.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.281
- Mm.
- As you'll see all too soon.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.284
Yo. Safe travels, siblings!

06:42.499 --> 06:44.454
'Kay. We'll see you guys in L.A.

06:44.539 --> 06:45.995
for Mom and Mig's
anniversary party.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.115
- KEVIN: All right.
- Love you.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.593
RANDALL:
Love you.

06:49.130 --> 06:52.883
Well, I am off to start
my fearless best life for Mom.

06:52.968 --> 06:54.419
- Mm.
- Whatever that means.

06:54.504 --> 06:56.522
- Do you, brother.
- (chuckles)

06:56.607 --> 06:57.958
- Be good.
- You, too.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.677
- All right.
- All right.

07:04.719 --> 07:05.726
REBECCA:
Hmm.

07:05.956 --> 07:06.953
Hey.

07:07.038 --> 07:08.694
You guys sticking around
for breakfast?

07:08.779 --> 07:09.804
We're having leftovers.

07:09.889 --> 07:10.889
And pie.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.799
Um... no.

07:12.884 --> 07:14.702
But thanks.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.234
BETH:
God.

07:16.414 --> 07:17.732
I can't find her anywhere.

07:17.817 --> 07:20.219
- Who?
- Deja. She's not in the house.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.228
(exhales)

07:30.647 --> 07:32.430
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

07:32.515 --> 07:33.876
I woke up
and she was already gone.

07:33.983 --> 07:34.992
Tess?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.828
Tess?

07:36.913 --> 07:37.932
I don't want you to get mad.

07:38.016 --> 07:39.266
I'm already there.

07:39.351 --> 07:40.786
Where's your sister?

07:41.931 --> 07:43.182
She left last night.

07:43.655 --> 07:44.838
She what?

07:44.923 --> 07:47.012
She was really upset. And
I tried to talk her out of it,

07:47.096 --> 07:49.289
but she wouldn't listen to me.
So she took off.

07:50.281 --> 07:52.304
She went to talk Malik
into getting back together.

07:52.415 --> 07:54.051
- Oh, good Lord.
- I can't believe

07:54.136 --> 07:55.226
she would do this.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.445
- Where you going?
- To get my daughter.

08:00.123 --> 08:01.207
(door opens)

08:01.663 --> 08:03.210
Should I go with you?

08:03.295 --> 08:04.879
I mean,
we'd have to take the girls.

08:04.964 --> 08:07.328
Hey, guys. I know this is a lot,

08:07.413 --> 08:09.102
but let's take a deep breath

08:09.187 --> 08:10.875
and it will feel
less overwhelming.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.571
Or maybe we should just let Kate
handle it,

08:12.655 --> 08:14.523
since she handles
all the big stuff now.

08:18.638 --> 08:20.618
Hey, Miguel,
I hate to put you out, man,

08:20.703 --> 08:22.848
but could you give Beth and
the girls a ride back to Philly?

08:22.932 --> 08:24.476
Uh, sure. Yeah, I can do that.

08:24.561 --> 08:26.412
Thank you.
I'll call you from the road.

08:26.497 --> 08:27.748
All right.
I'll keep trying Deja.

08:27.832 --> 08:29.068
Yeah.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.936
- Mom, what are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.922
Hey, Miguel. Could you grab
my bags for me, please?

08:39.783 --> 08:40.856
That's really not necessary.

08:40.940 --> 08:42.541
I am coming with you.

08:43.639 --> 08:45.474
Get in the car.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.054
(footsteps)

08:52.306 --> 08:53.804

08:59.475 --> 09:00.960
Come on.

09:01.547 --> 09:02.765
(Randall clicks tongue)

09:02.850 --> 09:04.040
- Hmm...
- Your call has been forwarded

09:04.124 --> 09:06.209
to an automatic voice...

09:06.294 --> 09:08.242
Malik's not picking up, either.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.632
I swear, when I get to Boston,
I'm gonna...

09:11.725 --> 09:13.208
- (exhales)
- What?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.602
Do you even know what you're gonna do
when you get there?

09:15.686 --> 09:17.437
I haven't got it
all mapped out, Mom,

09:17.522 --> 09:19.106
but throwing Deja
over my shoulder

09:19.191 --> 09:21.627

the backseat has come to mind.

You know the car
has Bluetooth, right?

09:27.246 --> 09:29.498
If Malik were to have picked up
the phone,

09:29.583 --> 09:30.701
do you think
what you would say to him

09:30.785 --> 09:32.455
would help or hurt
the situation?

09:32.540 --> 09:34.342

10:06.446 --> 10:08.644
She told me and Beth
she was going to a sleepover,

10:08.729 --> 10:10.496
and she hopped on a bus
to Boston.

10:11.283 --> 10:12.718
Mm.

10:15.556 --> 10:18.207
I was not like this with Beth.

10:18.604 --> 10:20.015
No, you were not.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.367
But...

first love story is the same.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.461
(chuckles softly)

10:37.546 --> 10:39.993
(sighs)
I was head over heels for him.

10:40.078 --> 10:42.367
He looked like James Dean.

10:42.452 --> 10:44.104

Kate handling the big things...

11:03.858 --> 11:05.742
That was a stupid joke.
That's all.

- Wow. That is a throwback.

each night on the couch,

19:28.405 --> 19:29.389
(camera snaps)

19:29.473 --> 19:30.773
Wow, that's a good one.

19:30.858 --> 19:32.543
RANDALL:
That's a good one.

19:32.628 --> 19:33.778
REBECCA:
Mm.

19:33.977 --> 19:36.000
- Hmm?
- They have a dartboard.

19:36.085 --> 19:38.930
Your father and I used to play
darts all the time at Froggy's.

19:39.015 --> 19:40.400
RANDALL:
Hmm.

19:41.062 --> 19:43.164
You want to play?

19:44.128 --> 19:46.046
Yeah, sure. Well, why not?

19:46.257 --> 19:47.257
(exhales)

19:47.749 --> 19:49.015
Know what?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.962
We don't need pictures of it.

19:51.828 --> 19:53.890
I'll remember this part.

19:54.054 --> 19:55.682
And you will, too.

19:55.922 --> 19:57.424
I promise.

19:59.654 --> 20:00.704
Come on.

20:00.789 --> 20:02.415
Let me go kick your butt.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.164
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, let me show you

20:04.249 --> 20:06.017
- how it's done.
- It's like that.

20:09.007 --> 20:12.110
[♪]

20:14.117 --> 20:15.701
(phone dialing)

20:16.384 --> 20:17.368
Uh...

20:17.453 --> 20:19.005
(line ringing)

20:19.090 --> 20:20.107
REBECCA:
Hello?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.433
Hey.

20:21.517 --> 20:24.170
Randall. It's almost 11:00.

20:24.254 --> 20:26.605
And I have a pulse,
and I found a phone.

20:26.689 --> 20:29.078
We're just at Kate's diner,
goofing off.

20:29.163 --> 20:31.565
It's actually nice. Been a while
since we all hung out.

20:33.049 --> 20:34.217
Yeah.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.248
You doing okay?

20:38.336 --> 20:39.454
(inhales)

20:39.539 --> 20:41.737
I will be.
(exhales)

20:44.515 --> 20:47.531
Uh, Kate told me about Miguel.

20:49.251 --> 20:52.237
I don't know why
I'm taking this so hard.

20:52.890 --> 20:54.450
He was a big part of your life.

20:55.561 --> 20:58.364
You know, it's natural
to feel, uh...

20:59.745 --> 21:01.757
...yeah, no, just to feel.

21:02.024 --> 21:03.375
Yeah, well, I am...

21:03.576 --> 21:05.094
I'm feeling.

21:05.179 --> 21:06.512
(inhales)

21:06.596 --> 21:09.315
Anyway, you know what?
Don't let me keep you.

21:09.399 --> 21:10.849
You go enjoy your evening

21:10.933 --> 21:12.781
with your brother and sister,
all right?

21:12.961 --> 21:14.220
Hey, uh...

21:14.609 --> 21:16.735
could you check
the right pocket of my backpack?

21:16.820 --> 21:18.221
I think it's on the couch.

21:20.983 --> 21:22.586
Yeah, it's right here.

21:22.671 --> 21:23.685
Open it.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.417
(sniffles)

21:25.581 --> 21:26.982
(sighs)

21:29.189 --> 21:31.158
[♪]

21:35.131 --> 21:36.673
Our cookies.

21:36.781 --> 21:38.703
(chuckles) Yeah.
I stopped by Eat'n Park

21:38.788 --> 21:39.745
on my way home.

21:39.829 --> 21:41.047
I wanted to give it to you
before dinner,

21:41.131 --> 21:43.682
but a lot was going on.

21:43.766 --> 21:45.184
Randall, thank you.

21:45.268 --> 21:46.185
This is...

21:46.269 --> 21:47.719
I-I needed this.

21:47.803 --> 21:48.887
(exhales)

21:48.971 --> 21:50.499
You're welcome.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.925
Mom, now, don't eat it all.
Come on.

21:54.009 --> 21:55.108
What are you talking about?

21:55.193 --> 21:57.145
- You got these cookies for me.
- No, Mom.

21:57.230 --> 21:59.298
Sharing is caring.
You taught me that. (Chuckles)

22:06.386 --> 22:07.803
Well...

22:07.988 --> 22:10.907
at least their only room left
is also their finest.

22:10.992 --> 22:12.410
(Rebecca chuckles)

22:13.345 --> 22:15.447
You sure you're okay with this?

22:15.532 --> 22:16.633
It's lovely.

22:18.768 --> 22:20.303
Okey do key.

22:28.775 --> 22:29.977
(spits)

22:46.624 --> 22:49.570
You have more gray
in your beard.

22:49.655 --> 22:51.983
I know. Can't seem to stop it.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.969
(Rebecca chuckles)

22:55.971 --> 22:57.072
(sniffs)

23:00.910 --> 23:03.179
(faucet running)

23:04.347 --> 23:06.382
(phone ringing)

23:13.313 --> 23:15.448
Jae-won, it's late, buddy.

23:17.121 --> 23:18.789
Push the meeting.

23:20.095 --> 23:22.314
I don't know, man. There's a lot
going on right now.

23:22.398 --> 23:23.849
Just, um...

23:23.933 --> 23:27.503
need to find some more runway
to kick this can, okay?

23:29.088 --> 23:31.324
(sucks teeth)
All right, later.

23:34.548 --> 23:36.883
What can is being kicked?

23:37.967 --> 23:39.301
Um...

23:40.550 --> 23:43.659
Senior Senator from Pennsylvania
keeps calling,

23:43.744 --> 23:45.145
wanting to meet.

23:46.768 --> 23:48.120
Why don't you want
to meet with him?

23:48.204 --> 23:49.288
It sounds important.

23:49.373 --> 23:50.823
Uh, it's complicated.

23:51.093 --> 23:53.304
Well, okay.

23:53.429 --> 23:57.066
Well, if you don't want
to talk about it, I won't pry.

23:58.799 --> 24:00.635
(exhales noisily)

24:12.393 --> 24:15.445
You know that article,
the five fun facts?

24:15.943 --> 24:17.745
Mm-hmm.

24:18.919 --> 24:20.929
It's not just a fluff piece.

24:21.176 --> 24:23.479
It's part of a bigger strategy.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.745
I've been getting these calls
from the DNC,

24:27.830 --> 24:30.733
this, um, Senator Gamble,
in particular.

24:31.550 --> 24:33.318
He's retiring next year,

24:33.403 --> 24:35.187
and he's put my name
on a short list

24:35.271 --> 24:36.988
of potential people
to replace him.

24:37.725 --> 24:39.825
- Now, it's a long shot, Mom.
- What?

24:39.909 --> 24:41.660
I don't have a national profile,

24:41.744 --> 24:45.497
but, uh, the first election
got a lot of attention, and, uh,

24:45.581 --> 24:47.766
this rehab initiative
is getting some more, so...

24:47.850 --> 24:50.593
Oh, my God, Randall.

24:50.753 --> 24:52.819
- Ma.
- You are gonna be a senator?

24:52.904 --> 24:55.657
- No, I'm not, Ma. (Laughs)
- (chuckles)

24:55.855 --> 24:59.608
I haven't even decided if it's
something I'm interested yet.

24:59.762 --> 25:01.947
All right? Beth just got settled
into her dance academy.

25:02.031 --> 25:04.934
I can't put her through
another campaign.

25:07.843 --> 25:09.927
I just don't want to make
any major life decisions

25:10.012 --> 25:14.007
with so much uncertainty
in the family.

25:14.311 --> 25:15.694
You know?

25:16.105 --> 25:17.506
Mm.

25:19.334 --> 25:21.385
Yeah, I understand.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.660
(inhales)

25:22.885 --> 25:24.954
[♪]

25:33.062 --> 25:35.064
[♪]

25:40.026 --> 25:42.366
(children giggling)

25:45.038 --> 25:46.819
And that is how you get it done.

25:46.904 --> 25:48.517
Killer job, Randall.

25:48.602 --> 25:50.820
It is my great honor
to now certify

25:50.904 --> 25:53.390
that you are allowed
in the deep end, kiddo,

25:53.474 --> 25:54.554
with the big kids.

25:54.669 --> 25:55.827
No more limits.

25:55.912 --> 25:57.436
Let me let the lifeguards know.

25:57.521 --> 25:58.822
Congratulations.

26:00.021 --> 26:01.960
- REBECCA: How'd she do?
- (Jack scoffs)

26:02.210 --> 26:03.712
Today is not the day.

26:06.987 --> 26:09.055
[♪]

26:23.270 --> 26:25.772
(breathes deeply)

26:26.973 --> 26:29.410
(footsteps approaching)

26:29.879 --> 26:31.029
Settled the bill.

26:31.653 --> 26:33.021
Ready to go?

26:34.008 --> 26:35.244
Yeah.

26:36.130 --> 26:38.115
Will you sit with me
for a minute?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.365
(clicks tongue)
Okay, but just for minute.

26:40.496 --> 26:42.194
If we hit the road by 11:00,

26:42.279 --> 26:43.773
we'll be in Boston in time
to get back to Philly... Okay.

26:43.857 --> 26:46.077
Just sit. Please.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.910
(Randall groans)

26:48.158 --> 26:49.794
(Rebecca sighs)

26:56.119 --> 26:57.453
(chuckles)

26:58.180 --> 27:00.686
I remember watching you swim
as a little boy.

27:01.342 --> 27:04.478
You took to it so fast.

27:05.182 --> 27:07.749
That first summer,
you were just all...

27:07.948 --> 27:10.593
(chuckles)
...skinny limbs and...

27:10.894 --> 27:14.046
flailing arms,
but you were still so good.

27:14.287 --> 27:16.406
- (clicks tongue)
- Yeah.

27:17.068 --> 27:20.071
And then the next summer,
you were a little bigger.

27:20.590 --> 27:22.208
And then the summer after that.

27:22.410 --> 27:24.312
You kids just kept changing.

27:25.431 --> 27:27.920
Getting better and better,
and stronger and stronger.

27:28.005 --> 27:29.106
Every...

27:30.737 --> 27:32.988
...second, every day,

27:33.073 --> 27:35.075
every year, you just...

27:36.543 --> 27:38.265
...you became.

27:41.332 --> 27:43.334
It was quite a thing for me...

27:44.156 --> 27:48.393
...having a front-row seat
to the best show in town.

27:55.498 --> 27:57.663
I know you're worried about me,
sweetheart.

27:57.748 --> 27:59.475
- Oh, Mom, I'm not even...
- No, no.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.827
It's okay.

28:01.192 --> 28:03.110
This...

28:03.322 --> 28:06.574
this disease has taken
its toll on everybody...

28:06.659 --> 28:07.911
(inhales)

28:08.118 --> 28:10.153
...but on you, especially.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.273
(inhales)

28:16.437 --> 28:19.689
When your dad died,
you just, uh...

28:19.773 --> 28:21.758
you really rose
to the occasion, Randall.

28:21.842 --> 28:24.545
Any time I needed you,
you were there.

28:25.139 --> 28:29.032
I used to think you kind of
became my rock after Dad,

28:29.117 --> 28:31.035
but in reality,

28:31.936 --> 28:34.225
no, this thing you and I have,

28:34.520 --> 28:36.756
that was there long before then.

28:38.271 --> 28:41.157
I mean,
Dad didn't love to read,

28:41.242 --> 28:43.861
- so you read with me.
- (chuckles)

28:44.132 --> 28:46.884
And then, when your dad died,

28:46.968 --> 28:48.886
you didn't end up going to
the college that you wanted to

28:48.970 --> 28:51.055
- so you could be near me.
- That's not true.

28:51.139 --> 28:53.190
It is true. It's very true.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.875
You-you took care of me.

28:55.582 --> 28:57.635
Which, yes,

28:57.720 --> 29:01.968
it is the natural course
for parents and children.

29:02.179 --> 29:05.608
Eventually, but not that soon.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.888
Not that early.

29:08.638 --> 29:10.055
It was...

29:11.186 --> 29:12.675
it was a lot to ask of you.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.728
It was, it was too much.

29:20.434 --> 29:23.137
And that is why I couldn't
make you the executor.

29:24.588 --> 29:27.991
Because you and I both know
you would move heaven and earth

29:28.076 --> 29:29.359
to see me get better,

29:29.443 --> 29:32.749
and you would stop
your entire life for me.

29:33.014 --> 29:35.507
- And I can't let you do that.
- (sniffles)

29:35.698 --> 29:37.033
Not anymore.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.303
You are my hero, Randall.

29:48.963 --> 29:51.248
You're the most
incredible person,

29:51.515 --> 29:53.183
and I...

29:53.702 --> 29:56.586
I will not be the person
that holds you back anymore.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.222
- You've never been that.
- No, I know.

29:58.306 --> 30:00.090
- I know.
- (exhales)

30:00.174 --> 30:01.542
I know.

30:04.310 --> 30:06.379
[♪]

30:09.350 --> 30:10.600
(sniffles)

30:10.684 --> 30:12.036
(exhales)

30:12.120 --> 30:13.370
(sniffles)

30:13.454 --> 30:14.788
(clears throat)

30:17.625 --> 30:20.444
Hey, can I say something
that sounds obnoxious

30:20.528 --> 30:22.443
that I can only say to you?

30:23.532 --> 30:26.602
- Well, yes, that's what I'm here for.
- (chuckles)

30:30.971 --> 30:34.451
If I do this thing,
I'll win, Mom.

30:38.312 --> 30:40.381
If I run, I'll win.

30:41.553 --> 30:43.000
And if I win,

30:43.474 --> 30:45.986
I can't even imagine
where this thing will end.

30:46.818 --> 30:48.405
I can.

30:49.075 --> 30:51.678
I can see it very clearly.

30:54.579 --> 30:56.330
- (phone ringing)
- (sniffles)

30:56.524 --> 30:58.092
(sighs)

30:59.438 --> 31:00.872
It's Deja.

31:02.603 --> 31:03.937
Hello.

31:05.566 --> 31:06.902
Hey, Dej.

31:09.577 --> 31:11.240
I'm on my way right now.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.553
(engine shuts off)

31:21.021 --> 31:22.548
- (seat belt unbuckling)
- REBECCA: Hey.

31:22.632 --> 31:23.982
Gentle.

31:24.067 --> 31:27.070
(breathes deeply)

31:39.298 --> 31:41.100
(sniffling)

32:02.204 --> 32:04.529
You know, I didn't do this
because of you.

32:09.216 --> 32:11.468
No, um... (exhales)

32:11.693 --> 32:13.622
...it just wasn't fair to her.

32:14.905 --> 32:16.646
For either of us, really.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.710
I just love her so much.

32:30.775 --> 32:33.578
That's the thing
about first loves, man.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.081
They form you

32:37.281 --> 32:40.201
and can stay with you
for the rest of your life.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.404
Yeah.

32:48.409 --> 32:50.595
You know, these things have
a way of coming back around,

32:50.679 --> 32:52.562
Malik, if they're meant to be.

32:53.218 --> 32:56.400
A person can walk out the door
and that's the end,

32:56.484 --> 33:00.488
but sometimes, the door reopens.

are in trouble...
