00:26.235 --> 00:27.151

00:27.194 --> 00:29.028
Happy holidays, everyone.

00:29.071 --> 00:33.532
I'm backstage before
the most massive masked
event in history,

00:33.534 --> 00:37.244
our first ever
head-to-head finale.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.621
Who will join monster,

00:39.623 --> 00:42.958
fox, the night angel,

00:43.002 --> 00:46.170
and who could forget
about the sun,

00:46.213 --> 00:48.630
and of course, the piglet,

00:48.632 --> 00:51.050
as "masked singer" champion?

00:51.093 --> 00:54.303
It's the holiday event
of the year.

00:54.346 --> 00:58.849
So buckle up
for a wild, wild ride,

00:58.893 --> 01:02.352
and let's get
this jingle brawl started.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.479
Here we go!

01:05.024 --> 01:07.191
Welcome, everyone,

01:07.234 --> 01:11.195
to "the masked singer" finale!

01:11.238 --> 01:15.199
We've never had a prize fight
showdown like this before

01:15.242 --> 01:19.244
with just two singers facing off
for the golden mask trophy.

01:19.288 --> 01:24.291
And this is the first time
our finalists have ever
shared the stage.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.586
Give it up for queen of hearts.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.879
<i> ♪ who is that?</i>
<i> Who is that? ♪</i>

01:28.923 --> 01:32.382

for the bull!

01:32.426 --> 01:35.260
<i> ♪ who is that?</i>
<i> Who is that? ♪</i>

01:35.304 --> 01:38.138
ho, ho, who is hiding
under these masks,

01:38.140 --> 01:41.100
and who will win it all?

01:41.143 --> 01:44.436
We are about to find out.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.149
Bull, just what does
it mean to you

01:49.193 --> 01:50.984
to be here in the finale?

01:51.028 --> 01:52.653
It means the world to me.

01:52.696 --> 01:57.157
I did not honestly think I was
going to make it this far, nick.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.992
I just was along for the ride.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.245
But I'm so glad I got a ticket

02:01.288 --> 02:04.998
to get on
"the masked singer" express

02:05.000 --> 02:09.044
because I don't plan
on stopping this train

02:09.088 --> 02:10.879
any time soon!

02:10.923 --> 02:12.673
- I heard that.
- Whoo!

02:12.675 --> 02:16.844
And the amazing queen of hearts,
what about you?

02:16.887 --> 02:21.056
I just think this show
has been so fun,

02:21.100 --> 02:23.308
and it's just the privilege
of a lifetime

02:23.394 --> 02:26.854
to get to express yourself
this way

02:26.897 --> 02:28.647
with such talented people.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.483
So it's just been a blast.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.693
Nick: Love to hear that.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.405
Now, bull, you're up first
with a brand new holiday song

02:36.448 --> 02:39.449
before your two finale
performances later tonight.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.120
Happy holidays, america.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.873
It's my favorite time
of the year,

02:45.875 --> 02:48.167
and tonight
will be extra special

02:48.169 --> 02:51.003
because I'm gonna
finally reveal who I am.

02:51.046 --> 02:54.173
The panel has been
all over the place trying
to figure me out.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.966
They've guessed r&b artists.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.010
- Sisqó.
- Lil nas x.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.219
Broadway stars.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.014
- Leslie odom jr.
- Taye diggs.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.265
Pro singers.

03:03.601 --> 03:07.978
The killers' brandon flowers.
I think of rufus wainwright.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.605
Usher. He can do it all.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.607
Oh, and ken thought I was...

03:11.609 --> 03:13.233
Dwayne johnson, the rock.

03:13.277 --> 03:17.196
- What?
- Spoiler alert,
I am not the rock.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.157
But now it's time to rock out

03:20.201 --> 03:24.119
with a song I hope gets you
in the holiday spirit.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.615
Though it will be bittersweet

04:43.617 --> 04:46.285
because I loved hearing
all the panel's guesses.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.829
They thought I could be
an oscar-winning actress.

04:48.872 --> 04:53.583
- Jennifer lawrence.
- Could be renée zellweger,
who has an amazing voice.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.544
Or a grammy-winning singer.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.879
- Christina aguilera.
- I think that's right.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.881
- That is jewel.
- Off the top of my head,

04:59.925 --> 05:02.175
- just thinking
of kelly clarkson.
- I was thinking gaga.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.761
And jenny, well, she focused
on the country stars.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.765
Kellie pickler. Faith hill.
There's carrie underwood.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.853
- I don't know!
- Before you find out
if any of them are right,

05:12.896 --> 05:16.898
enjoy this song
that always brings me joy
around the holidays.

masked event of them all,

07:42.129 --> 07:45.672
"the masked singer" finale!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.883

Natasha:
This is my character.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.674
I think she's a chance
to kind of let out

08:29.676 --> 08:34.221
some of my more spicy energies
that I have, but flirty.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.210
So I was getting
ready in my room,
putting the outfit on,

10:29.254 --> 10:32.297
and I could hear this amazing
voice in the room next to me,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.382
and it was the bull's voice.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.301
I'm like, "okay, this is
some fierce competition."

10:36.345 --> 10:38.219
I can't wait to find out

10:40.223 --> 10:43.058

my nemesis from day one.

since I was a baby bull,

11:07.501 --> 11:10.451
and I was blown when she sang
"it's a man's world."

11:10.462 --> 11:12.796
I mean,
it was a skunk's world,

11:12.798 --> 11:16.132

Bull was such
a standout talent.

12:44.431 --> 12:49.058
I think the bull
could win on just energy
and presence alone,

12:49.102 --> 12:50.685
but bull happens to have
a beautiful,

12:50.729 --> 12:51.603
beautiful voice as well,

12:51.897 --> 12:53.855
so I totally wish bull
the best of luck.

I'm going down, but, um--

21:09.978 --> 21:11.811
no clue. Except I heard

21:28.037 --> 21:30.746

21:30.790 --> 21:32.290
I was so nervous beforehand,

21:32.333 --> 21:35.209
<i> but I'd say it's the song</i>
<i> that had the biggest impact</i>

21:35.253 --> 21:38.170
<i> on me making it here,</i>
<i> "la vie en rose."</i>

21:43.303 --> 21:44.885
<i> see, I don't speak french,</i>

21:44.929 --> 21:47.263
<i> so I had to write out</i>

<i> so I could learn</i>
<i> to pronounce them correctly.</i>

21:49.017 --> 21:51.600

24:16.456 --> 24:17.705
I'm gonna be honest.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.417
What people don't know about me
is that I'm extremely insecure,

<i> and I'm oftentimes so afraid</i>
<i> of the challenges before me,</i>

24:25.465 --> 24:27.798

to be let out of its cage.

24:27.842 --> 24:32.595
So the bull, for me,
could not be a better metaphor
for what I'm going through.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.013
When I looked at the mask

24:34.015 --> 24:36.974

38:35.731 --> 38:37.981
Thank you so much for just
being so visceral and raw.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.190
Like, there's a reason
that you're the heart.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.277
You're like the blood in our
veins to our heart right now

38:42.279 --> 38:44.946
through that performance.
Thank you so much.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.781
Ken: Absolutely.

38:46.825 --> 38:47.991
God bless you.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.453
- We're just honored
to be in your presence.
- Yes.

38:51.496 --> 38:55.999
And it's such an honor
to make it to tonight's
head-to-head showdown.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.126
I can't wait
to show y'all my face.

38:58.128 --> 39:01.338
<i> This giant heart head</i>
<i> is coming off very soon,</i>

39:01.381 --> 39:03.631

<i> I think he's the most</i>

39:13.101 --> 39:15.685
<i> he really can do everything,</i>

39:15.729 --> 39:18.855
<i> but I'm gonna do everything</i>
<i> I can to win tonight.</i>

39:18.899 --> 39:20.023

39:36.208 --> 39:40.168
My heart is set

39:42.672 --> 39:44.255
Now as they say,

39:44.299 --> 39:47.050
it's better to give
than to receive,

39:47.052 --> 39:49.636
so our two finalists
will give you a present

39:49.679 --> 39:51.679
and reveal a holiday clue

39:51.723 --> 39:54.474
that may finally crack
their secret identity.

39:54.518 --> 39:58.302
Men in black,
your presence is requested.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.648
Let's unbox
this merry old hint.

40:01.691 --> 40:02.941
Olé!

40:02.984 --> 40:05.151
Let's see what's inside.

40:05.195 --> 40:10.323
Ooh, a record that could finally
help you solve who I am.

40:10.367 --> 40:13.993
You'll know later tonight
when I'm no longer bull-headed.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.996
I can't wait for you
to see my face.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.166
Hey, america, guess what?

40:20.168 --> 40:24.003
I have a holiday clue too
from my heart crew.

40:24.047 --> 40:28.091
Take a look at my magical
frosty friend.

40:28.135 --> 40:31.302
What do you think
this baseball snowman means?

40:31.346 --> 40:35.181
I'll see you soon
at the grand finale. Mwah!

40:36.226 --> 40:37.851
Nick:
<i> Coming right up,</i>

40:37.894 --> 40:41.020

40:46.027 --> 40:47.235
How are we supposed
to vote, ken?

40:47.279 --> 40:48.611
They're both amazing!

40:56.872 --> 40:58.788
Welcome back, america.
I'm backstage.

40:58.832 --> 41:02.750
Less than two minutes until
the head-to-head finale begins.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.421
Let's check in
with our finalists before
the big showdown starts.

41:06.423 --> 41:09.174
Let's go in here
to see queen of hearts.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.176
Wow, I wanna wish you luck.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.886
You look amazing,
you know I'm a fan,

41:12.888 --> 41:15.263
and it's all about to go down.
Are you ready?

41:15.265 --> 41:18.892
I'm ready. I'm so excited.
I'm built for this.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.977
I'm gonna go
sing my heart out.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.896
There it is.
She's gonna sing
her heart out.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.981
Keep it going
for the queen of hearts.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.357
Now, I wish you
the best tonight.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.277
Come on, y'all, let's go
over here to the bullpen.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.988
Bull, I see you
in here chilling.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.157
You are less
than a minute away

41:34.201 --> 41:36.034
from the moment
you've been fighting for.

41:36.077 --> 41:39.621
- Talk to me.
- I feel so ready
for this, nick.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.289
I was born for this.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.459
This is not
my first rodeo, okay?

41:44.461 --> 41:46.419
I heard that.
The bull back here chilling.

41:46.421 --> 41:50.089
He looks like he ready.
Getting his hooves shined
and everything.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.133
Good luck tonight, bull.

41:52.177 --> 41:55.053
Never has the race
been this close.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.346
All will be revealed.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.097
The most insane,
unpredictable,

41:58.141 --> 41:59.933
mind blowing
