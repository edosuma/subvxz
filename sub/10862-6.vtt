Very funny, guys.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Surprise!

00:56.000 --> 00:59.040
I can't believe
you remembered!

00:59.040 --> 01:01.240
Look, how could
we forget?

01:01.240 --> 01:03.960
You only reminded us
a zillion times.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.440
He did not!

01:05.440 --> 01:06.640
We'd never forget
your birthday.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.280
Dave even has
a special story for you.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.320
Really?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.480
Let's go.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.280
Yeah.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.480
I know how much
you like magic,

01:14.480 --> 01:18.040
so I kind of borrowed one
of your magical characters.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.200
Which one?

01:19.200 --> 01:22.040
Sit down, my friend,
and you'll find out.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.960
My story is indeed
about magic--

01:29.960 --> 01:31.680
the kind Gary likes,

01:31.680 --> 01:34.800
the kind that
dazzles and amazes

01:34.800 --> 01:37.360
but is still strangely real.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.960
But the magic in my story
is more intense

01:40.960 --> 01:44.000
than the kind that comes from
incantations or elixirs.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
It's the kind of magic
that comes from inside of us,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
a magic that
can be used for good...

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Or incredible evil.

for you.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.120
Where did
you get these?

02:29.120 --> 02:30.440
My dad got them.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.040
I knew you liked them,
so I pinched a couple.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.440
You're the best.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.080
So you going to
the dance Friday?

02:39.080 --> 02:42.960
Uh, no. I'm not
much of a dance guy.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.960

a sit-and-watch guy.

I take her for granted.

No, no. It's OK.
I can do it.

such a klutz.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.080
Yeah. Me, too.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.160
So, uh, are you going
to the dance on Friday?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.920
Maybe. I don't know.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.280
Gary's being a pain.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.680

to fill in or anything...

You need help,
Keith.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.680
Let me help you.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.440
No one
can help me now.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.880
Let me try.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.720
Just go away! Just go!

17:06.880 --> 17:08.400
Aah!

17:31.840 --> 17:33.320
[Groaning]

17:34.800 --> 17:36.320
[Groaning]

18:10.360 --> 18:11.840
[Music playing]

18:20.360 --> 18:21.120
Hi.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.280
Whoa! You're beautiful.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.040
Hi.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.400
I think this could be the
best moment of my life.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.480
All right, kids.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.320
This is the time during
the annual homecoming dance

19:18.320 --> 19:22.520
when we award the trophy
for the best athlete in school.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.040
The envelope, please.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.760
And the winner is...

19:30.760 --> 19:31.760
Who else?

19:31.760 --> 19:34.480
Gary March! Yeah!

19:35.840 --> 19:37.600
Congratulations, Gary!

19:45.360 --> 19:49.400
I'd like to dedicate this award
to Shelly Bergman.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.840
I'd just like her to know she's
got first place in my heart.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.280
And, uh, I'd give anything

19:58.280 --> 20:01.360
if she'd dance
the next dance with me.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.840
[Music playing]

20:13.840 --> 20:15.360
I'm sorry, K.C.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.320
Ask me to dance...
please.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.240
Isn't it gross to be
stared at like this?

20:49.240 --> 20:51.760
Mariah...

20:51.760 --> 20:53.760
The potion...

20:53.760 --> 20:54.840
Isn't it wonderful?

20:54.840 --> 20:57.760
<i>Now you can fall
in love with me.</i>

20:57.760 --> 21:00.240
What are you
talking about?

21:00.240 --> 21:03.240
I could never
tell you this before,

21:03.240 --> 21:04.760
but I love you.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.760
So if you want a
pretty girl like Shelly,

21:07.760 --> 21:09.760
I'll be a pretty girl.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.320
Isn't it wonderful?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.320
[Groaning]

21:15.840 --> 21:17.240
What's going on?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.240
Nothing, sir.
It's OK.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.520
I'm fine.
I think I need air.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.280
This feels awful.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.720
How much did you take?

21:36.720 --> 21:38.200
[Panting]

21:38.200 --> 21:41.080
I-- I drank
the whole bottle.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.200
No! Why did
you do it?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.760
I did it for you.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.520
You wanted
a beautiful girl.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.120
Mariah!

21:56.120 --> 22:00.480
Keith, what's happening?

22:05.280 --> 22:07.240
It's my fault.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.240
I'm the one who's supposed
to change, not you.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
Why?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.800
I didn't want
to be me anymore.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.720
My leg, the brace...

22:19.720 --> 22:21.480
I'm sick of it.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.160
I can't be normal.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.720
People stare at me.
I hate myself.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.160
I don't hate you.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.240
I didn't want this
to happen to you.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.680
Mariah...

22:37.680 --> 22:41.240
Please don't go.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.680
Keith?

22:52.680 --> 22:54.200
It's you.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.240
It's really you.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.680
What happened?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.240
I think I beat
the Dark Dragon.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.440
I don't understand.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.200
It's been inside me
since the accident,

23:09.200 --> 23:11.760
but it's gone now.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.520
The potion did exactly
what it said it would.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.280
Keith? Mariah?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.120
What are you doing here?

23:24.120 --> 23:28.680
I was, uh, just taking
my girl to the dance.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.640
The end.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.400
Happy birthday, Gary.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.800
[All]
Happy birthday, Gary!
