00:05.974 --> 00:09.141
As Poseidon is our witness,

00:15.974 --> 00:17.941
may our word be our bond.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.841
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

00:32.541 --> 00:34.407
All of Atlantis
is pleased for us.

00:36.241 --> 00:37.541
So it seems.

00:37.574 --> 00:41.707
And I feel sure the gods
will bless our union, too.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.307
Such certainty, Heptarian.

00:46.974 --> 00:48.774
You'll see.

00:48.807 --> 00:52.907
They'll give us a sign
and then you
will believe, too.

00:54.974 --> 00:58.741
Friends, citizens of Atlantis,

00:58.774 --> 01:02.647
nothing could please us more
than the announcement today

01:02.681 --> 01:06.647
of the betrothal
of our daughter to
Poseidon's servant, Heptarian.

01:06.681 --> 01:07.680
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

01:11.014 --> 01:15.147
And as is the custom
of our great city,
a pankration will be held,

01:15.181 --> 01:18.314
the like of which
we have never seen.

01:18.347 --> 01:20.081
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

01:30.381 --> 01:32.447
You did well today.

01:32.481 --> 01:36.681
The gods smile on you,
as they will when
you win the pankration.

01:37.914 --> 01:39.414
Yes.

01:41.247 --> 01:43.781
-She will come round.
-You think so?

01:43.814 --> 01:45.147
(SCOFFS)

01:45.181 --> 01:48.881
It doesn't matter
if she doesn't.
Ariadne's alone.

01:48.914 --> 01:50.647
No friends, no allies.

01:52.081 --> 01:55.181
Where will she
find the strength to defy
the will of her father?

02:31.087 --> 02:32.821
What are they celebrating?

02:32.854 --> 02:36.121
Minos has
announced a pankration.

02:36.154 --> 02:37.821
-A what?
-It's not important.

02:37.854 --> 02:42.721
Not important?
The one occasion where
food and wine flow free.

02:42.754 --> 02:44.921
That's free, Pythagoras!

02:44.954 --> 02:46.554
What could be more important?

02:46.587 --> 02:49.154
-Your friend?
-Hmm?

02:50.287 --> 02:52.821
Ah, yes, well.
No, you wouldn't
be interested.

02:52.854 --> 02:54.154
It's just a silly contest.

02:54.187 --> 02:58.054
Two unarmed opponents,
a knife in the sand,

02:58.087 --> 03:00.594
the first to draw blood wins.

03:00.627 --> 03:04.027
No rules.
Oh, it's something to see,
believe me.

03:04.061 --> 03:07.127
-It's barbaric.
-And free pies.

03:07.161 --> 03:08.994
Why wouldn't I be interested?

03:11.494 --> 03:14.394
Pythagoras?

03:14.427 --> 03:19.061
This pankration
is to celebrate Ariadne
and Heptarian's betrothal.

03:20.527 --> 03:24.227
I see. Of course.

03:27.627 --> 03:29.727
It was never really
going to happen,
was it, Jason?

03:29.761 --> 03:33.394
I mean, Ariadne's a goddess
on Earth, whereas you...

03:35.094 --> 03:36.494
You're just you.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.061
Well done.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.427
What?

03:49.494 --> 03:50.494
What?

03:56.961 --> 04:00.201
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

-Who gave you this?
-Medusa.

05:15.474 --> 05:16.941
And no one else knows?

05:21.907 --> 05:23.241
Jason wants to meet me.

05:23.274 --> 05:26.474
Ariadne,
is everything all right?

05:26.507 --> 05:28.507
Yes. Yes, thank you.

05:31.207 --> 05:34.507
The pankration begins
tomorrow. You are expected
at your father's side.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.974
Of course.

05:37.674 --> 05:39.674
Good.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.074
Oh, and if I could have
what you have so carefully
hid in your hand?

05:45.807 --> 05:47.407
Your Highness?

05:56.807 --> 05:59.247
Guard! Where did you get this?

05:59.281 --> 06:01.014
(SOBS)

06:01.047 --> 06:04.847
Not to matter, we can have
that discussion later.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.214
-Take her away.
-Please!

06:06.247 --> 06:08.347
What, you really think
this can go unpunished?

06:10.381 --> 06:11.881
What will you do to her?

06:11.914 --> 06:15.147
A servant who betrays
our trust must suffer
the consequences,

06:16.147 --> 06:18.981
no matter who her mistress is.

06:19.014 --> 06:21.981
(SIGHS) Ariadne, why must
we always fight over this?

06:22.014 --> 06:26.947
You are betrothed to
Heptarian. Do you really
think this is appropriate?

06:26.981 --> 06:28.047
What if the people knew of it?

06:28.081 --> 06:29.581
Where would your
reputation be then?

06:31.114 --> 06:33.881
This must end.
Do you understand?

06:35.247 --> 06:36.381
And Korinna?

06:39.014 --> 06:41.514
I have no desire
to punish the innocent.

06:41.547 --> 06:44.147
Remove this boy from your life
once and for all

06:44.914 --> 06:46.581
and Korinna may return.

06:47.514 --> 06:49.014
That's fair, isn't it?

06:51.981 --> 06:56.014
You see, we don't
have to be enemies.

07:17.387 --> 07:19.387
-Were you followed?
-No.

07:22.821 --> 07:24.487
You must be quick.

07:24.521 --> 07:27.421
If you should be
found here it would
be death for both of us.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.721
Thank you.
I won't forget this.

07:39.054 --> 07:41.354
Why did you ask
to see me, Jason?

07:42.621 --> 07:43.821
I...

07:44.987 --> 07:46.987
I heard about your betrothal
to Heptarian.

07:48.454 --> 07:50.854
The whole city knows now.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.987
I couldn't quite believe
it at first.

07:55.921 --> 07:58.054
We've not known each other
that long.

07:58.621 --> 08:00.027
Hardly any time at all.

08:01.394 --> 08:02.894
And yet,

08:03.627 --> 08:05.794
the thing is I, erm...

08:07.827 --> 08:10.194
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like you before.

08:11.894 --> 08:13.461
No other princesses
of Atlantis?

08:14.927 --> 08:16.161
No one as wonderful.

08:18.061 --> 08:19.861
No one as beautiful as you...

08:19.894 --> 08:21.194
-No one...
-Please, don't.

08:24.027 --> 08:27.661
And I think, maybe,
just maybe...

08:29.594 --> 08:31.061
You have feelings for me, too.

08:33.061 --> 08:37.594
Don't go ahead with
this marriage, Ariadne.
Please, I'm begging you.

08:37.627 --> 08:39.061
It cannot be.

08:40.161 --> 08:41.661
It cannot.

08:43.794 --> 08:46.827
-Why not?
-(SNIFFLING) Because...

08:46.861 --> 08:51.027
Because you are you
and I am me,

08:51.061 --> 08:54.994
a princess of Atlantis,
betrothed to another.

08:55.027 --> 08:57.161
-Yes, but...
-I have a duty

08:57.194 --> 09:01.834
to my people,
a duty to Poseidon himself.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.701
To marry someone
that you don't love?

09:04.734 --> 09:06.201
What sort of duty is that?

09:09.534 --> 09:13.267
Why come here?
Why agree to meet me?

09:13.301 --> 09:16.901
So that you could understand
that we must bow to our fates,

09:18.701 --> 09:20.201
whatever the cost.

09:20.234 --> 09:22.601
I don't believe that.
There must be something...

09:22.634 --> 09:23.934
Be content with this.

09:26.167 --> 09:28.834
If the choice had
been mine alone,

09:28.867 --> 09:31.034
I would not leave you
for one moment.

09:35.401 --> 09:37.667
Now you must go.

09:37.701 --> 09:42.167
-Ariadne...
-If you truly love me, please
don't make this harder.

09:55.534 --> 09:59.574
Here. Don't forget me.

09:59.607 --> 10:01.707
I need no token
to remember you.

10:02.274 --> 10:03.607
Still...

10:24.407 --> 10:26.574
(SOBBING)

10:32.107 --> 10:38.574
Ariadne, I see you've done
the right thing.

10:38.607 --> 10:41.607
I know how hard this must have
been for you, Ariadne.

10:44.274 --> 10:45.741
And Korinna?

10:45.774 --> 10:47.674
I shall see she is released.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.641
Oh, no. Come. Come here.

10:56.507 --> 10:58.174
It will get better.

10:59.981 --> 11:01.547
It will.

11:04.955 --> 11:09.588

11:11.155 --> 11:14.022
(BANGING CONTINUES)

11:25.655 --> 11:28.455
-I saw Ariadne.
-Jason.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.122
You were right.
She is promised to Heptarian.

11:32.088 --> 11:34.055
Well, perhaps
it's for the best.

11:34.088 --> 11:38.288
At least now you know,
you can accept it, move on,

11:39.355 --> 11:41.088
and get on with
the rest of your life.

11:41.888 --> 11:44.322
It's not over. Not yet.

11:50.655 --> 11:55.122
I swear solemnly
before Poseidon,
the guardian of the oaths,

11:55.855 --> 11:58.155
to fight fairly
and to the end.

12:01.188 --> 12:05.262
Poseidon hears your promise
and wishes you good fortune.

12:21.328 --> 12:25.928
I swear solemnly
before Poseidon,
the guardian of the oaths,

12:25.962 --> 12:28.495
I will fight fairly
and to the end.

12:30.295 --> 12:33.962
Poseidon hears your promise
and wishes you good fortune.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.828
Of course,
we would've stopped you!

12:43.862 --> 12:46.962
-People die in the
pankration, Jason.
-They don't just die.

12:46.995 --> 12:49.228
They get bits sliced off them
and then they die.

12:49.262 --> 12:52.628
This won't win Ariadne back.
She's told you, it's over.

12:52.662 --> 12:53.962
Was it ever really on?

12:53.995 --> 12:55.695
I'm not doing
this for Ariadne.

12:55.728 --> 12:57.795
No, you're always
saying that we need
to earn more money,

12:57.828 --> 12:59.262
and this is a way to win some.

12:59.728 --> 13:01.028
That is true.

13:01.062 --> 13:03.235
Jason, Heptarian's been
fighting in the pankration

13:03.268 --> 13:06.102
since he was a boy
and he's never lost. Ever.

13:06.135 --> 13:08.902
I'm doing it and it doesn't
matter what you think.

13:08.935 --> 13:10.768
You don't stand a chance.

13:10.802 --> 13:13.668
The pankration
isn't like other contests.

13:13.702 --> 13:16.202
It takes months of practice.

13:17.602 --> 13:19.035
Then we'd better get started.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.768
So I just need to get
to the knife first?

No taste, no odour,

14:42.142 --> 14:43.675

are not sudden?

14:43.708 --> 14:47.042
So gradual they
may not at first
even be noticed.

some pain, no more.

remember this service to her.

I can to forget we ever met.

You'll have to talk
to each other some time.

-No.

going up to her.

-Medusa.
-Hercules.

19:55.336 --> 19:58.469
-May I come in?
-Yes, yes, of course.

19:58.503 --> 20:00.903
I have the ingredients
you asked for. Hercules!

20:00.936 --> 20:02.369
Sorry, sorry...

20:04.076 --> 20:05.409
Thank you.

20:06.276 --> 20:08.243
The herbs will ease the pain

20:08.276 --> 20:11.909
and the poultice should
bring down the swelling.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.543
That won't work.

20:13.576 --> 20:16.043
And suddenly you're
an expert on the healing arts?

20:16.076 --> 20:17.976
I've seen this before,
in the wrestling ring.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.943
The shoulder is separated.

20:19.976 --> 20:22.143
It just needs putting back.

You pick these things up.

20:45.576 --> 20:47.943
He'll still need the tonic.
You have the ginger?

20:47.976 --> 20:49.209
And the mint.

20:49.243 --> 20:51.976
They need chopping
and the coriander grinding.

20:52.009 --> 20:53.376
HERCULES: I'll get the pestle.

20:58.609 --> 21:01.143
Medusa,
does this mean you're
speaking to me again now?

21:01.176 --> 21:03.249
-No.
-Right, fine. Just checking.

21:06.949 --> 21:08.783
The boy's a fool for entering.

21:08.816 --> 21:11.149
But for all that,
I am grateful.

21:11.183 --> 21:14.016
I shall take great pleasure
in destroying him
in front of all of Atlantis.

21:14.049 --> 21:17.383
Well, just make sure
you do so cleanly, the crowd
must not turn against you.

21:17.416 --> 21:19.349
-Today was unnecessary.
-It's the pankration.

21:19.383 --> 21:21.516
If you are to
become king, Heptarian,

21:21.549 --> 21:22.816
you must be seen
to behave like...

21:22.849 --> 21:24.549
(GASPS)

21:24.583 --> 21:27.216
-Ariadne!
-Congratulations, My Lord.

21:27.249 --> 21:29.349
It seems the gods
really do smile upon you.

21:29.383 --> 21:32.816
I hope so.
You'll be attending tomorrow?

21:34.016 --> 21:35.383
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

21:36.483 --> 21:38.649
I shall be thinking of you
as I compete.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.549
If you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling rather tired.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.316
Of course.
Good night, Ariadne.

21:44.349 --> 21:45.783
-My Lord.
-Good night.

21:50.949 --> 21:52.549
Did I not tell you
she would come round?

21:52.583 --> 21:54.383
I'll feel a lot happier
with Jason gone.

21:54.416 --> 21:58.749
Oh, forget Jason. When you
are king, you can do with him
as you feel fit.

21:58.783 --> 22:02.216
Until then, concentrate on
the task in hand.

22:02.249 --> 22:06.589
Of course. And how is Minos?

22:07.223 --> 22:08.956
Mmm.

22:08.989 --> 22:12.356
-The King's health is
already not what it was.
-Hmm.

22:13.289 --> 22:15.356
But I shall nurse
him to the end.

22:17.956 --> 22:19.489
You can be sure of that.

22:22.723 --> 22:23.723
(FIZZING)

22:35.323 --> 22:37.023
You work too hard, My Lord.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.723
There are some
affairs of state that
only the King can determine.

22:40.756 --> 22:43.956
Too many, it sometimes feels.

22:43.989 --> 22:47.889
But as long as you
are by my side, the burden
seems a lighter one.

22:47.923 --> 22:50.123
I've brought you
some refreshment.

22:50.156 --> 22:52.656
-You are very kind.
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

22:55.523 --> 22:59.623
The people are enjoying
the pankration,
do you not think?

23:00.256 --> 23:01.823
Oh, undoubtedly.

23:01.856 --> 23:06.096
Even Ariadne seems interested.

23:06.129 --> 23:07.763
If you'd rather I got you
something else, My Lord...

23:07.796 --> 23:11.629
Oh, no, no, this is
most welcome. Thank you.

23:37.729 --> 23:39.363
How is he?

23:40.763 --> 23:43.629
Still feverish,
but at least he's sleeping.

23:43.663 --> 23:45.363
Maybe he shouldn't
fight tomorrow.

23:46.629 --> 23:48.063
He'd never agree to that.

23:48.096 --> 23:50.296
But if he's injured...

23:50.329 --> 23:53.763
Jason would
rather lose the fight
than lose face by pulling out.

23:54.263 --> 23:56.529
Why?

23:56.563 --> 23:59.996
He thinks he's fighting
for Ariadne's hand.

24:00.029 --> 24:02.896
But he must know
that's hopeless.

24:02.929 --> 24:06.269
When you're in love
there's no such
thing as hopeless.

24:10.969 --> 24:13.036
You should get some sleep.
I can take over.

24:13.069 --> 24:15.803
-Oh, I shouldn't leave him.
-Don't you trust me?

24:15.836 --> 24:18.336
-I didn't mean that.
-I know.

24:23.569 --> 24:27.236
Then I shall keep you company
if that's all right with you.

24:35.203 --> 24:37.503
Why are you
doing this, Hercules?

24:37.536 --> 24:39.403
-He mustn't get cold.
-I didn't mean that.

24:42.769 --> 24:48.336
When I was Jason's age,
I thought I was
the fastest, strongest,

24:48.369 --> 24:51.836
most agile man
in all of Atlantis.

24:51.869 --> 24:55.003
No one on the field
or in the arena
could challenge me.

24:56.336 --> 24:59.569
I know what you're thinking.
"What happened?"

25:00.169 --> 25:02.436
No! No.

25:03.509 --> 25:05.343
You know the truth?

25:06.976 --> 25:09.143
I never was that man.

25:11.976 --> 25:16.043
It was all made up,
just a story I told myself

25:16.076 --> 25:17.909
and anyone else who'd listen.

25:22.209 --> 25:23.943
But Jason's the real thing.

25:25.143 --> 25:26.976
He's special, Medusa.

25:27.009 --> 25:29.376
And it's my job to make sure
he stays that way.

25:29.409 --> 25:30.509
Whatever it takes.

25:33.476 --> 25:37.343
But if you ever
tell him that, obviously
I'll have to kill you.

No, I think I can.
It's just a case of exploiting

You cannot win
because Heptarian cannot lose.

think the King would give
you Ariadne's hand?

39:06.842 --> 39:08.882
-Ariadne!
-Let her speak.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.249
You must have
felt it, too, Heptarian.

39:12.282 --> 39:15.849
You were the man with
years of experience,
the superior fighter.

39:15.882 --> 39:18.782
And yet, here comes some
unknown boy.

39:20.482 --> 39:22.949
Only the gods
could be responsible
for the outcome.

39:24.749 --> 39:26.749
We had an understanding.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.182
And now the gods
have put us right.

39:34.982 --> 39:38.149
This is what you
sincerely believe?

39:40.649 --> 39:43.215
It is.

39:43.249 --> 39:46.749
Then we must bow to a wisdom
greater than ours.

39:46.782 --> 39:49.415
-The engysis must
be dissolved.
-But, My Lord, can I...

39:49.449 --> 39:52.015
Only a fool would fail to
listen to the gods.

39:53.415 --> 39:57.149
Come, come,
let us find the priest
and put this right.

39:58.115 --> 40:01.015
My Lord, if we could
discuss this further...

40:05.649 --> 40:07.989
You foolish, foolish girl!

40:10.789 --> 40:12.489
Do you really think
you can defy me?

40:12.522 --> 40:14.055
I'm not afraid
of you any more.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.255
I'm not afraid of anyone.

40:18.489 --> 40:19.989
Today has taught me that.

40:21.955 --> 40:23.655
(SNIGGERS)

40:25.189 --> 40:29.589
Then you are more stupid
than you can possibly imagine.

40:39.422 --> 40:42.322
HERCULES: The next year,
the other competitors
were so scared,

40:42.355 --> 40:43.689
they refused to fight me.

40:43.722 --> 40:45.189
They couldn't find
a single challenger.

40:45.222 --> 40:47.689
PYTHAGORAS: Hercules,
that is simply not true.

40:47.722 --> 40:49.355
I swear on my mother's life.

40:49.389 --> 40:51.122
JASON: Hold on. I thought
you said you didn't
know your mother?

40:51.155 --> 40:52.355
I knew of her.

40:52.389 --> 40:55.389
Have you ever actually taken
part in a pankration?

40:55.422 --> 40:57.489
-Absolutely.
-Not just watched it?

40:57.522 --> 41:00.255
-And eaten the free pies?
-Or drunk the free wine?

41:00.289 --> 41:03.522
-Slept it off under
the benches?
-Of course he has.

41:03.555 --> 41:06.955
I have heard it many times.
Hercules was the fastest,

41:06.989 --> 41:09.562
strongest, most agile man
in the whole city.

41:09.595 --> 41:12.695
He was the envy
of all the contestants.
Everyone knows that.

41:12.729 --> 41:15.762
-Really?
-Yes, really.

41:15.795 --> 41:18.029
You're lucky to
have him as a friend.

41:19.162 --> 41:20.529
So am I.

41:21.595 --> 41:23.395
I don't deserve you, Medusa.

41:23.429 --> 41:24.729
Life's not fair, is it?

41:30.529 --> 41:32.262
(CROWD MURMURING)

41:57.462 --> 41:59.162
There's nothing you
can do, Ariadne.

42:00.995 --> 42:02.829
Nothing anyone can do.

42:05.095 --> 42:06.329
I don't understand.

42:08.169 --> 42:11.135
They say the poor girl
took her own life.

42:12.769 --> 42:17.569
(SOBBING)
When? Why?

42:17.602 --> 42:19.569
It seems that even though
the King pardoned her,

42:19.602 --> 42:23.035
she felt the shame too deeply.

42:29.602 --> 42:31.002
She wouldn't have done that.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.235
-She wouldn't!
-I'm sorry.

42:36.769 --> 42:39.702
I know you two were...
Close.

42:43.169 --> 42:46.269
The main thing now is
to do everything we
can for her family.

42:49.135 --> 42:50.535
Don't you think?

43:27.509 --> 43:28.742
(NEIGHING IN FEAR)

43:30.142 --> 43:31.542
These are the Furies.

43:31.975 --> 43:33.042
(SHOUTING)

43:33.509 --> 43:35.509
(BOTH GRUNTING)

43:35.542 --> 43:37.042
Stop! Stop!

43:37.075 --> 43:38.409
He's my brother.
