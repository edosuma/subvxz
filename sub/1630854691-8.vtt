WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:07.529
Arjuna!

00:07.529 --> 00:10.575
Can you hear me?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.972
Anyone!

00:26.374 --> 00:28.593
Arjuna!

00:28.593 --> 00:30.595
Get me out of here!

01:21.907 --> 01:23.300
<i>You've reached
Ciprien Grieve.</i>

01:23.300 --> 01:25.259
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:25.259 --> 01:27.478
Hey, Sip,
I haven't heard from you.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.436
Can you call me back
when you get this?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.654
It's important.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.278
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:47.716 --> 01:50.327
<i>Did you make this happen?</i>

01:52.590 --> 01:54.070
Get off me!

01:54.070 --> 01:56.464
<i>Ah! What are you doing?</i>

01:56.464 --> 01:58.466
<i>Stop, please!
- Shut up!</i>

01:58.466 --> 02:00.903
<i>- No!
- Shut up, witch!</i>

02:00.903 --> 02:03.123
So what did they use?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.255
Duct tape?
<i>- No! No!</i>

02:05.255 --> 02:06.343
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

02:09.999 --> 02:12.175
And zip ties.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.962
When your coven gets together,

03:43.962 --> 03:46.791
do you, like...

03:46.791 --> 03:47.879
call the corners?

03:55.931 --> 03:57.019
Come here.

03:59.064 --> 03:59.978
Your face.

04:21.348 --> 04:25.134
W-what do you mean...
c-call the corners?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.745
I saw it in a movie.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.793
Do you like movies?

04:34.752 --> 04:36.624
I'm always looking

04:36.624 --> 04:40.105
for someone to go with me, but...

04:42.934 --> 04:44.980
I can't go to the movies now.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.552
I could if you would help me.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.771
I wonder if you would help me.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.995
Help me open the cage.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.959
I'm not gonna do that.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.763
Is there a problem?

05:30.286 --> 05:32.593
I just--I'm just looking
for Tessa.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.290
I need to talk to her.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.292
Aren't you supposed to be
on a plane

05:36.292 --> 05:38.599
to San Francisco by now?

05:39.469 --> 05:42.820
I-I need her to ask Lasher
a question for me.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.084
Please? It's important.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.435
Fine. Wait here.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.073
You want a plate for that?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
No, thank you. I'm fine.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.559
Tessa's not in her room.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.170
Didn't even sleep in her bed.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.650
Are you worried?

07:13.650 --> 07:16.261
Probably went to a friend's.
I texted her.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.612
She'll answer
when she gets around to it.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.352
Maybe we should check in
with her friends.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.442
What is this "we"?
There is no we.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.105
Sorry.
May I please use the bathroom?

07:38.545 --> 07:39.937
<i>You have no idea.</i>

07:39.937 --> 07:42.810
My boss, she's all over me
all the time.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.290
But I've been in the business
a lot longer than her.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.858
But guess who makes
twice as much money.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.818
And guess
who's always leaving early

07:50.818 --> 07:51.949
for a date.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.387
Don't you go on dates?

07:55.387 --> 07:57.694
Nobody...

07:57.694 --> 08:00.218
wants to swipe right
on this face.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.876
What's wrong with your face?

08:10.881 --> 08:13.449
Show me.

08:33.295 --> 08:36.428
Let me see you.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.098
You're handsome.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.581
<i>Anyone can see that.</i>

09:01.758 --> 09:03.064
I can see it.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.286
I can see
you holding the key...

09:09.940 --> 09:15.206
Reaching out, using the key
to unlock the cage...

09:17.382 --> 09:19.167
So we can be closer together.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.189
Keith! Arlo wants you.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.590
It's a big day.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.244
Today we have a chance to get

10:36.244 --> 10:40.857
real, solid proof
of witchcraft.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.119
An actual witch on video.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.512
Nobody's ever caught that.

10:43.512 --> 10:47.472
And if we get it,
no more hiding in the shadows.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.171
We will take this movement
to the next level.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.956
And that's not
just any tarot-card-reading

10:52.956 --> 10:54.915
little Wiccan down there either.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.394
That is a Mayfair.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.787
That is a legacy witch

10:57.787 --> 11:00.703
that our friend Keith here
introduced us to.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.750
She's the real deal.

11:05.577 --> 11:09.494
So, uh, how are we gonna...

11:10.974 --> 11:12.454
<i>The old-fashioned way, Keith.</i>

11:12.454 --> 11:15.457
Threat of death.

11:15.457 --> 11:19.374
The only thing that ever drew
the truth out of a witch.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.115
Fire.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.726
- We don't have the right fuel.
- Excuse me?

11:23.726 --> 11:27.034
Lighter fluid and gasoline
is gonna leave bone behind.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.688
Now, what we need
is some thermite.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.169
I know where to get some.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.431
Go get it.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.044
I can do that.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.568
<i>Some kind of
industrial building.</i>

11:39.568 --> 11:41.657
<i>She saw Tessa being tied up.</i>

11:41.657 --> 11:44.399
<i>They had buckets of gasoline.</i>

11:44.399 --> 11:45.661
<i>She didn't come home
last night.</i>

11:45.661 --> 11:46.967
<i>I tried to track her.</i>

11:46.967 --> 11:49.273
<i>It didn't work.</i>

11:49.273 --> 11:51.275
<i>Now she's not answering
her phone.</i>

11:51.275 --> 11:53.713
Something's definitely wrong.
- We'll get help.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.497
I promise. Take a breath.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.326
- Hey, what's going on?
- We'll figure it out.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.676
Jojo had a premonition
about Tessa.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.460
Cortland's coming.
He's picking up Alonso.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.288
Good.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.464
<i>Don't worry.
Alonso will find her.</i>

12:06.464 --> 12:08.684
How could Tessa be
in trouble?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.251
Lasher's with her.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.771
Lasher...

12:56.036 --> 12:58.212
Lasher.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.953
Lasher, please...

13:03.521 --> 13:05.785
Why won't you come to me?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.615
You chose me.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.934
Wake up.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.808
Wake up.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.855
<i>If you...</i>

13:32.855 --> 13:35.597
<i>sound...</i>

13:35.597 --> 13:40.210
<i>we can help guide you out.</i>

13:44.693 --> 13:48.044
<i>If you can hear
the sound of my voice...</i>

13:55.008 --> 13:56.183
I hear you, Arjuna.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.793
<i>- Please listen.</i>
- I hear you.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.709
<i>We can guide you out.</i>

14:00.709 --> 14:04.017
<i>Ciprien,
we can try and help you.</i>

14:05.932 --> 14:08.630
It's Arjuna.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.894
You are trapped in a memory.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.375
<i>The object that you used
to enter the memory</i>

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
<i>is no longer here
with your body.</i>

14:16.768 --> 14:18.074
- The necklace.
<i>- The only way out</i>

14:18.074 --> 14:20.120
is the way you came in.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
You have to find that necklace.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.778
It is your portal.
There is no other way.

14:26.778 --> 14:30.652
No other way apart from death.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.872
The witch hunter.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.138
She came to me yesterday.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.401
She was very upset about
some guys on the Internet.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.359
She said that they had stolen
Deirdre's heart

14:42.359 --> 14:44.622
and she wanted
to confront them.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.798
So maybe that's what she did.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.757
Why'd she come to you?

14:48.757 --> 14:50.628
Because
she was the designee then.

14:50.628 --> 14:53.327
Because she had Lasher.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.894
Oh, Tessa.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.114
This is your fault.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.942
You should have gone to get
your own mother's heart.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.422
I didn't ask her
to do anything.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.903
You wouldn't help her,
so she went alone,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.774
thinking he had her back.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.645
But he's not with her.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.083
He's still with you.
- He's not.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.215
I haven't seen him
since the ceremony.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.740
Call him. Let's make sure.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.353
When I try to speak to him,
I-I get nothing.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.920
No response.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.356
Call him.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.881
Use the words.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.973
I think that would be
like inviting him back into me.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.410
And what if he's with her
and she needs him

15:33.410 --> 15:35.456
and-and I call him away?

15:36.979 --> 15:38.285
Okay, forgive me.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.721
Why are you even here?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.505
Didn't we all just go
to great lengths

15:41.505 --> 15:44.682
so you can bail on this family?

15:44.682 --> 15:47.120
You wanted to ask him
a question, right?

15:47.120 --> 15:50.079
What was so pressing?
What did you need to ask?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.169
That's not important now.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.432
Uh-uh.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.304
She's a goddamn liar.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.916
<i>Alonso, let's set you up
in the library.</i>

16:00.916 --> 16:03.179
Alonso's here.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.623
You can see me?

17:18.124 --> 17:20.778
<i>He's an--a scry.</i>

17:23.303 --> 17:27.176
He's found people
for the police, the FBI,

17:27.176 --> 17:28.569
even the Talamasca.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.224
<i>He'll find her.</i>

17:36.272 --> 17:37.969
I hope I'm wrong.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.623
But as visions go,
it was very clear.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.152
This may sting.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.285
Could you see
what time of day it was

17:49.285 --> 17:51.113
in your vision?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.854
You mean how much time
do we have to get to her?

17:54.508 --> 17:55.770
<i>I couldn't tell.</i>

18:05.562 --> 18:09.349
Um, tell me truly, cher,

18:09.349 --> 18:15.311
between us, um, is he with you?

18:16.704 --> 18:18.445
No.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.447
Ah.

18:20.447 --> 18:24.364
If he's not with her
and he's not with you,

18:24.364 --> 18:28.281
then, um, where is he?

18:29.847 --> 18:31.414
I really don't know.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.114
<i>Was he angry with you?</i>

18:35.114 --> 18:36.724
<i>Can you call him?</i>

18:49.084 --> 18:50.564
I'm not getting anything.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.175
It's muddy.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.874
This happens when there are
too many blood ties.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.398
The signal is confused.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.922
I always said you had
too many kids, Leesh.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.493
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

19:06.493 --> 19:07.798
Use my blood.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.193
The way it works
is close blood ties.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.152
Use me to find
my mother's heart.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.892
I'm her only child.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.894
And wherever that heart is,
that's where Tessa is, right?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.377
Could that work?

19:21.377 --> 19:22.683
Let's find out.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.208
Help! Help!

19:26.208 --> 19:28.167
Help! Anybody!
- Why isn't she gagged?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.430
Must have gotten it off somehow.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.737
Anyone who can hear me,
please--ow, no!

19:33.737 --> 19:37.176
<i>No! [screaming]</i>

19:37.176 --> 19:39.308
No!

19:39.308 --> 19:41.049
No, no, no. Leave it off.
Leave it off.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.399
We can get every word on video.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.009
What kind of magic
can you do, girl?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.098
I can't do magic.
Magic isn't real.

19:47.098 --> 19:50.058
That's funny.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.365
She'll show us soon enough.
Come on.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.541
No. Help!

19:54.541 --> 19:55.933
Help! Please!

19:55.933 --> 19:58.240
No! No!

19:58.240 --> 19:59.894
Stop! Help! Please!

19:59.894 --> 20:01.765
Help me, Keith.
Keith, this isn't you.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.942
Please don't do this.
You don't have to do this!

20:04.942 --> 20:07.554
Ow! Ow, ow.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.208
No!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.731
Can anyone hear me?

20:11.688 --> 20:13.124
Got her?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.517
Can anyone hear me?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
Help!

20:36.713 --> 20:38.367
How far along are you?

21:02.173 --> 21:03.566
It's so clear.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.873
The connection was strong.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.527
<i>She's just across the bridge</i>

21:07.527 --> 21:08.963
in that wild bit
of Jean Lafitte.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.360
She's pregnant.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.627
Let's split into groups
and we'll each search an area.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.324
Since when are you in charge?

21:22.324 --> 21:24.370
I'm not.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.893
But it's my fault
she's out there,

21:25.893 --> 21:27.808
and I wanna make it right.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.409
Suzanne.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.370
You have the necklace?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.406
Keep your phones on, everybody.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.016
And please speed.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.801
They're looking for proof.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.585
If they find it,
they will be coming for us all.

22:49.585 --> 22:50.934
<i>Tessa knows that.</i>

22:50.934 --> 22:52.414
<i>She would never give up
the family.</i>

22:52.414 --> 22:54.024
<i>If you get to her first,</i>

22:54.024 --> 22:55.896
text the thread.
Do not go in alone.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.202
We need to go in all at once,
a united front,

22:58.202 --> 23:00.074
so this can be quick
and bloodless.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.557
Rowan. A word?

23:05.862 --> 23:09.388
Now, cher,
I know you wanna help.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.085
But the best help
you can give right now

23:11.085 --> 23:13.653
is to call on him right here,
right now,

23:13.653 --> 23:15.437
and let him guide you.
- I'm not gonna do that.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.265
I've already explained--
- No, no, no.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.136
Think of your cousin.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.486
I'm thinking of her.
That's why--

23:20.486 --> 23:23.140
No, no, no, listen to me.
You must call him.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.580
Take your hands off me.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.598
I--

23:45.598 --> 23:48.122
<i>What was that?</i>

23:48.122 --> 23:50.994
Stay with him. He needs you.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.755
<i>There's no way out.</i>

24:12.755 --> 24:14.627
You're not in a human memory.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.371
Is this what happened to you?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.722
<i>Ah, you're the only person here.</i>

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
This is your memory?

24:28.510 --> 24:31.165
You lured me here,
and you trapped me.

24:31.165 --> 24:34.864
No. You did this to yourself.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.039
Let's play a game.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.525
Let's see what happens...

24:44.961 --> 24:48.530
If you die here,
will you die there?

24:48.530 --> 24:49.966
If you wanted me dead,

24:49.966 --> 24:53.187
you'd have done it weeks ago,
in the house.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.232
But you didn't.

24:55.232 --> 24:58.714
You let me go.
- No. She let you go.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.411
You'd served your purpose.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.987
She's pregnant.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.865
Then let me go to her,

25:18.865 --> 25:21.084
take care of her.

25:21.084 --> 25:24.348
If I've served my purpose,
why keep me here?

25:24.348 --> 25:25.785
I am no threat to you, right?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.264
She doesn't want you.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.224
She doesn't
wanna be domesticated.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.400
Why would a lion want
to be a house cat?

25:32.400 --> 25:33.662
I would never do that
to her.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.882
Of course you would.

25:35.882 --> 25:36.883
You already have.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.364
<i>You wanna control that power.</i>

25:40.364 --> 25:44.368
You want to suppress
her true desires,

25:44.368 --> 25:47.241
to conform
to your basic human morality.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.896
While you force your way
into her head,

25:49.896 --> 25:51.724
force her to commit
to your will.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.944
No, I enact her wishes,
and she wishes for power.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.772
If you're willing
to give her power,

25:56.772 --> 25:59.122
it is only because
her power will strengthen you.

25:59.122 --> 26:02.082
Of course it will.

26:02.082 --> 26:05.172
I am a part of her
just as she's a part of me.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.608
We're bound together.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.657
She doesn't see it yet,
but she will.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.833
And in her hour
of greatest need,

26:13.833 --> 26:15.748
it's me that she will call for.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.619
What have you done?

26:27.934 --> 26:28.978
What do you think
will happen to you

26:28.978 --> 26:30.632
when I leave?

26:35.855 --> 26:37.683
Will you still exist?

26:39.946 --> 26:42.252
Will any of this?

26:42.252 --> 26:44.690
Don't let her die.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.997
You should have stayed away.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.346
But even as a little boy,

26:49.346 --> 26:50.783
you couldn't help yourself,
could you?

26:52.872 --> 26:55.396
<i>You had to walk by the house.</i>

26:55.396 --> 26:57.833
You had to know
what was happening inside.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.143
Goodbye, Ciprien.

27:11.325 --> 27:14.545
Lasher...

27:33.216 --> 27:35.479
Something's changed.

27:42.878 --> 27:48.405
Hey. Hey.

27:48.405 --> 27:51.060
M-my family, we're not--

27:51.060 --> 27:54.455
We're not witches,
but we do have money.

27:56.718 --> 28:00.243
And if you help me,
I can help you.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.072
Woman to woman.

28:12.299 --> 28:15.171
You, uh--
you know what this place is?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.348
<i>Mayfair Auto Parts.</i>

28:20.046 --> 28:23.876
Glen and me spent 17 years here

28:23.876 --> 28:26.617
putting car parts
into cardboard.

28:29.359 --> 28:32.841
Then you shut us down...

28:32.841 --> 28:34.451
outsourced our jobs.

28:34.451 --> 28:37.498
Woke up one morning,
didn't have a paycheck,

28:37.498 --> 28:39.630
didn't have health insurance.

28:43.722 --> 28:48.596
Our daughter Jenny
was at your hospital...

28:48.596 --> 28:50.946
halfway through
her chemotherapy.

28:57.474 --> 29:02.044
I'm-I'm so sorry,
but that wasn't me.

29:02.044 --> 29:04.873
It was your family.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.833
You profited off it, right?

29:09.835 --> 29:11.271
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:11.271 --> 29:13.708
So woman to woman...

29:16.102 --> 29:17.799
You are on your own.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.561
Henbane.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.962
Nice and easy.
Come back nice and slow.

30:33.962 --> 30:37.009
You found the necklace.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.319
Henbane.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.495
Henbane!

30:45.495 --> 30:47.323
You died in the memory?

30:52.589 --> 30:55.636
Aw.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.900
I have to get to--

30:58.900 --> 31:01.207
I have to get to her now.

31:01.207 --> 31:04.079
Ciprien...

31:06.081 --> 31:07.953
Stay here.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.258
Thank you.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.746
What the hell came over you?

31:21.531 --> 31:24.099
Jojo, dear, would you get me
a glass of water?

31:43.118 --> 31:44.946
She's pregnant.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.034
As soon as I heard,
I tried to get her

31:46.034 --> 31:47.209
to call out to him,

31:47.209 --> 31:49.298
but she insisted on going
to the woods

31:49.298 --> 31:51.692
to rescue her foolish cousin.

31:51.692 --> 31:53.389
I need you to handle this.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.218
<i>Now.</i>
- I'll take care of it.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.263
<i>She's gone out to look
for her</i>

31:57.263 --> 31:58.829
<i>somewhere in the Jean Lafitte.</i>

31:58.829 --> 32:01.615
Hmm. I know the area.

32:01.615 --> 32:04.226
We had eyes on an event
that may have precipitated

32:04.226 --> 32:06.663
this unfortunate situation.

32:08.187 --> 32:10.102
<i>Oh, good.</i>

32:10.102 --> 32:11.799
But once you find her,

32:11.799 --> 32:13.670
you do
what you Talamasca do best.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.977
I'll take it from here.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.895
Sir...

32:20.895 --> 32:23.637
Rowan Mayfair is in trouble.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.161
Lasher was trying
to keep me away from her.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.858
Um, something is happening
right now,

32:27.858 --> 32:29.164
but I don't know where.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.862
Good thing I do. I'll drive.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.874
<i>Turn left at the stop sign.</i>

32:43.874 --> 32:46.007
<i>Turn left.</i>

32:53.754 --> 32:55.582
Is this you?

33:05.548 --> 33:07.768
<i>Turn left.</i>

33:07.768 --> 33:09.465
<i>Sir, can you go any faster?</i>

33:09.465 --> 33:12.555
You know,
I'm impressed with you, son.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.689
You put yourself on the line
for this case again and again.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.038
<i>I didn't know you possessed</i>

33:17.038 --> 33:19.171
<i>this kind of commitment
to the work.</i>

33:19.823 --> 33:21.042
I think you're ready.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.915
- Ready for what?
- Did you know

33:24.915 --> 33:27.048
that when the Talamasca
was a young organization,

33:27.048 --> 33:31.226
several European chapters had
their own agents killed

33:31.226 --> 33:33.663
if they failed to keep confidentiality

33:33.663 --> 33:35.622
<i>or demonstrated
supernatural giftedness</i>

33:35.622 --> 33:37.058
in any public way?

33:37.058 --> 33:39.060
Killed.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.757
<i>Can you imagine?
Of such priority</i>

33:40.757 --> 33:43.064
<i>was the mission to hide
the supernatural</i>

33:43.064 --> 33:44.848
<i>from those
who would condemn it--</i>

33:44.848 --> 33:48.504
the Church, of course,
at that time,

33:48.504 --> 33:50.028
the Templars, certainly--
- Sir...

33:50.028 --> 33:51.638
could you please drive
a little faster?

33:51.638 --> 33:53.292
Well, there's no need.

33:53.292 --> 33:54.684
We're here.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.518
We're not gonna save
your girlfriend this evening.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.825
She's gonna save herself.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.835
What is this?

34:14.835 --> 34:17.316
If we don't get to her now,
she's gonna call down Lasher.

34:17.316 --> 34:19.318
That's right.

34:19.970 --> 34:22.408
- What the--
- The deep truth,

34:22.408 --> 34:23.931
the one I want you
to really hear,

34:23.931 --> 34:26.977
is that our highest purpose
is to watch--

34:26.977 --> 34:28.588
to make record
of the supernatural forces

34:28.588 --> 34:29.980
that shape our world,

34:29.980 --> 34:31.547
for such time
as action may be necessary.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.028
Action is necessary
right the fuck now.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.204
Change can be difficult.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.249
You've gotten caught up
in this.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.467
You need to step back.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.426
To watch, Ciprien,
that's our job.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.865
You're in this with Lasher.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.261
You're a part of this.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.610
If she makes the choice

34:50.610 --> 34:53.134
that we believe
she's gonna make,

34:53.134 --> 34:56.268
she's about to fulfill
a very old prophecy.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.139
And a new era will begin.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.749
What prophecy?

34:59.749 --> 35:00.968
What are you talking about?

35:00.968 --> 35:02.796
What's going to happen to her?

35:11.848 --> 35:13.154
Damn it!

35:13.154 --> 35:15.025
Wait! No, stop.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.810
Please don't do this.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.421
Don't do this. I'm not a witch.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.162
Keith...

35:21.162 --> 35:23.338
Keith, look at me.
I-I-I'm not a witch.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.992
<i>Please, I'm just a girl.</i>

35:24.992 --> 35:27.125
All set?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.909
Don't you see
there's no way--

35:28.909 --> 35:30.606
there is no way for me to prove

35:30.606 --> 35:32.086
<i>I'm not what you think I am.</i>
- Shh, shh.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.264
We're gonna give you
one chance

35:36.264 --> 35:37.657
to do the right thing.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.488
Show us your magic.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.888
I'm not a witch.

35:52.846 --> 35:54.152
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>

35:55.370 --> 35:56.545
You're lying.

35:56.545 --> 35:59.200
We all heard you call out
to someone

35:59.200 --> 36:00.941
out in those woods.
- That was a prayer

36:00.941 --> 36:03.552
my mother taught me.
- Oh, a prayer? Good.

36:03.552 --> 36:06.033
Well, if you worship God,
then come clean.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.584
<i>No!</i>

36:35.584 --> 36:38.196
It doesn't prove anything!
I'm begging you.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.981
Please.

36:40.981 --> 36:44.071
All right, that's it.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.725
You're giving us
no other choice.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.033
All right, do it.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.252
<i>No!</i>

36:57.476 --> 36:59.391
- Rodney?
- What the hell?

37:16.625 --> 37:18.192
Ahh, it's her!

37:18.192 --> 37:20.629
She's doing it. She's doing it!

37:21.326 --> 37:22.283
Arlo...

37:25.982 --> 37:27.288
Help me...

37:27.288 --> 37:29.159
I never wanted any of this.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.864
<i>Ahh! No, please!</i>

37:37.864 --> 37:41.302
No!

37:46.002 --> 37:47.656
No!

37:52.139 --> 37:55.185
<i>Rowan, get up!</i>

37:55.185 --> 37:57.623
<i>I can't breathe! Hurry!</i>

38:02.149 --> 38:05.195
No! Get up!

38:05.195 --> 38:07.546
<i>Rowan, please hurry!</i>

38:07.546 --> 38:10.375
<i>Hurry! I can't breathe!</i>

38:10.375 --> 38:14.857
Tessa...

38:17.686 --> 38:19.558
I got you.

38:19.558 --> 38:20.602
Come on.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.174
Thank you. Thank you.

38:28.523 --> 38:32.397
This is--
This is yours.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.269
Take it, please.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.226
<i>Fucking witch!</i>

38:43.364 --> 38:45.235
Tessa.

38:49.675 --> 38:52.242
Tessa.
<i>- Don't let him get away.</i>

38:55.289 --> 38:57.030
Tessa. Tessa!

38:58.640 --> 39:01.382
No. Tessa.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.750
<i>Mi Daemon, ad me veni!</i>

39:21.750 --> 39:24.449
<i>Mi Daemon, mihi labora!</i>

39:24.449 --> 39:27.321
<i>Mi Daemon, me libera!</i>

39:28.757 --> 39:35.068
<i>♪ The sky lights up
once again ♪</i>

39:35.068 --> 39:39.638
<i>♪ Like sunrise rode
at his fall ♪</i>

39:39.638 --> 39:43.729
<i>♪ You know this</i>
