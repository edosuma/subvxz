<i>You're gonna go right up
to the gate and get her?</i>

04:39.167 --> 04:43.071
<i>Yeah. Jane, listen, I'm gonna
be as close as security allows.</i>

04:43.171 --> 04:47.174
<i>You know, she's pretty grown now.
Or at least she thinks she is.</i>

04:47.274 --> 04:50.710
<i>Jane, listen, I'm gonna be there
and I'm not gonna miss her.</i>

04:50.810 --> 04:52.533
<i>I'm gonna take her to get her bag,</i>

04:52.633 --> 04:55.203
<i>back to my place and I'm gonna
feed her and entertain her.</i>

04:55.303 --> 04:57.449
<i>And we're gonna do
the same thing all summer, okay?</i>

04:57.549 --> 05:01.875
<i>Okay. Thanks, really.</i>

05:07.190 --> 05:09.492
<i>Got a good tailwind up south.</i>

05:09.592 --> 05:11.727
<i>We should be able to make up
for that lost time</i>

05:11.827 --> 05:15.497
<i>on our slightly late departure
out of Seattle.</i>

05:15.597 --> 05:19.267
<i>Hope to have us all down
in Juneau on schedule,</i>

05:19.367 --> 05:23.336
<i>about 11:35.
Meantime, we have clear skies.</i>

05:23.436 --> 05:25.960
<i>The good news...</i>

05:46.956 --> 05:48.792
Kenz!

05:49.392 --> 05:52.561
Kenzie! Kenz!

05:52.661 --> 05:54.531
Hey!

06:00.332 --> 06:01.891
How are you?

06:07.205 --> 06:11.610
- Is this your bags here?
- Yeah, I got it, thanks.

06:12.610 --> 06:15.746
Yeah, so how was your flight?

06:15.846 --> 06:18.081
- It was fine.
- Fine?

06:18.181 --> 06:21.218
I'm sorry you had to move around so much.

06:22.618 --> 06:25.243
Glad you're here with me though.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.615
Just hop in there.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.885
Welcome to Alaska.

06:51.776 --> 06:54.000
Here we are.

07:09.258 --> 07:12.917
Jesus. What'd you pack in here?

07:21.300 --> 07:24.905
So this is... your home now.

07:25.205 --> 07:28.741
Go ahead and just help yourself
to whatever you want, okay?

07:28.941 --> 07:33.668
There's the kitchen over there
and "mi casa es su casa."

07:38.548 --> 07:41.274
It's like your own wing down here.

07:43.719 --> 07:46.144
This is your room.

07:49.656 --> 07:53.760
Over here is a closet for you. Put some
extra blankets in there and hangers.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.985
It gets cold at night, okay?

08:00.231 --> 08:06.160
Okay. Well... just take your time
and make yourself at home, all right?

08:31.428 --> 08:34.090
I can't believe how much you've grown up.

08:34.697 --> 08:37.134
Just look at you.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.426
The last time I saw you...

08:50.310 --> 08:53.080
Your dad really liked this place.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.139
I'm not sure why.

09:04.022 --> 09:06.381
I miss him.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.785
I miss him too.

09:14.363 --> 09:17.066
But maybe you want dessert?

09:17.166 --> 09:20.458
Yeah? Well, let's see what they have.

09:21.601 --> 09:25.305
- Well, how long am I up here for?
- <i>I don't know. I need some time.</i>

09:25.405 --> 09:28.807
<i>I just wanna be strong. You know,
there's just the two of us, okay?</i>

09:28.907 --> 09:31.276
- Yeah, whatever.
- <i>Don't do that.</i>

09:31.376 --> 09:34.678
<i>I'm gonna get set up in an apartment
nearby so I can just be an outpatient.</i>

09:34.778 --> 09:38.180
- Really? Where?
- <i>Seattle. Like around our old neighborhood.</i>

09:38.280 --> 09:40.282
I wanna come back then.

09:40.382 --> 09:43.318
<i>Oh, well, it's not that easy.
It doesn't really work that way.</i>

09:43.418 --> 09:47.888
<i>This is still part of my treatment, so...
How are you guys getting along?</i>

09:47.988 --> 09:50.624
- Fine.
- <i>He said you were havin' a blast.</i>

09:50.724 --> 09:53.093
<i>Said you're like an adult
compared to when he came</i>

09:53.193 --> 09:56.596
<i>and he stayed with you for, like,
three nights. Remember that?</i>

09:57.596 --> 10:00.020
<i>After Dad's funeral.</i>

10:43.256 --> 10:47.566
I have to go to work tomorrow.
I was thinking you should come with me.

10:50.344 --> 10:53.379
- I think I'm just gonna stay here.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

10:53.479 --> 10:56.103
We have computers and stuff.

10:58.515 --> 10:59.740
Okay.

11:07.923 --> 11:09.793
Right.

11:10.193 --> 11:14.392
Okay, I'll take a look at it and I'll
call you back. All right, thanks.

11:52.797 --> 11:55.433
I don't even know how long I'm here, Mom
says like a month, but who the hell knows?

11:55.533 --> 11:59.203
Hey, Kenz, this is my buddy Blain.
This is my niece, Mackenzie.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.004
Hi.

12:01.204 --> 12:02.876
Hey.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.664
She's on the phone.

12:07.408 --> 12:09.633
It's all right, it's my uncle.

12:19.419 --> 12:21.988
Kenzie, want more pizza?

12:22.488 --> 12:24.557
No, I'm gonna throw up.

12:24.657 --> 12:27.159
- Don't do that.
- Come on, hang out.

12:27.259 --> 12:30.851
- Have a seat.
- Watch some TV.

12:34.398 --> 12:36.933
Oh, man, I forgot something.

12:37.033 --> 12:39.291
I'll be right back.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.478
- Is that your phone?
- No.

12:52.878 --> 12:56.382
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

12:57.382 --> 13:00.284
- Answer it. Pick it up, answer it.
- What?

13:00.384 --> 13:02.552
- Pick it up, answer it.
- No, no, you answer it.

13:02.652 --> 13:05.811
- Answer it, pick it up.
- No. Fine. Fine.

13:07.122 --> 13:10.258
Stupid. Hello?

13:10.358 --> 13:12.463
Surprise!

13:13.660 --> 13:16.629
- What?
- It's... it's for you.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.073
It's from me.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.303
- You like it?
- For real?

13:21.403 --> 13:24.469
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

13:24.569 --> 13:27.471
This is mine? Shit!

13:27.571 --> 13:29.774
Blain went and picked it up for me.

13:31.074 --> 13:34.477
- You really like it?
- Yes! Fuck, thank you.

13:34.577 --> 13:36.868
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:52.892 --> 13:54.718
Come on!

14:08.939 --> 14:11.117
You havin' fun?

14:12.677 --> 14:14.501
Yeah.

14:18.347 --> 14:20.150
So...

14:20.950 --> 14:23.085
You like livin' here?

14:23.185 --> 14:25.020
Yeah.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.455
What's not to like?

14:27.555 --> 14:29.590
I don't know.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.764
It's cold.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.818
Well, yeah, in the winter it's cold.

14:41.565 --> 14:44.102
How long you been here?

14:44.502 --> 14:46.771
Well, about 15 years.

14:46.871 --> 14:49.565
Have you lived here
by yourself the whole time?

15:01.450 --> 15:04.120
What about a... a girlfriend?

15:04.220 --> 15:06.678
Well, we broke up.

15:08.123 --> 15:11.126
What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

15:11.226 --> 15:12.192
No.

15:12.292 --> 15:15.686
Well, I imagine all the guys
would be chasing you.

15:17.898 --> 15:19.722
Yeah.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.210
What about, like, a dog or something?
You ever get a dog?

15:33.310 --> 15:36.879
- No. You ever have a dog?
- No, but I want one.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.381
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:39.681 --> 15:42.116
Well, why don't we get a dog?

15:42.216 --> 15:45.465
- For real?
- Yeah. We got the space.

15:45.565 --> 15:48.376
Yeah, let's do it.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.884
Wanna try these on and see how they feel?

20:14.075 --> 20:16.544
It's always cooler out here
by the glacier, you know?

20:16.644 --> 20:19.847
Like, ten degrees cooler
in the wintertime.

20:19.947 --> 20:23.383
Check that out, Kenz. Mendenhall Glacier.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.319
Won't see anything like this
anywhere else, Kenz.

20:26.419 --> 20:29.243
It's pretty awesome?

21:09.225 --> 21:11.516
Got you some water.

21:15.162 --> 21:18.765
I'm gonna go back to my truck
and get my camera.

21:18.865 --> 21:21.434
It's turning out to be
a pretty nice day, man.

21:21.534 --> 21:26.539
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna take Kenzie
over to the waterfall, okay?

21:27.039 --> 21:31.099
I'm feeling fish tacos, by the way.
Fish tacos?

21:36.513 --> 21:40.039
- Are you cold?
- I'm fine.

21:44.452 --> 21:47.000
How's that sound, fish tacos?

22:14.914 --> 22:17.140
She's gentle.

22:23.355 --> 22:25.681
Come on, Skadi.

22:44.742 --> 22:47.996
I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

22:50.981 --> 22:53.340
You need your bag?

23:41.060 --> 23:42.951
Mackenzie!

25:28.461 --> 25:31.096
<i>Hey, West Seattle Health Center.</i>

25:31.196 --> 25:35.666
Hey, is Jane there?
It's Mackenzie, I'm calling for my mom.

25:35.766 --> 25:38.136
- <i>I'm sorry, who's this?</i>
- Hey, is Jane there?

25:38.236 --> 25:40.708
<i>Jane. We haven't seen her all week.
She checked herself out.</i>

25:40.808 --> 25:43.272
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Bill, head RN.</i>

25:43.372 --> 25:47.400
<i>Look, if you see her then please tell her
we're really concerned, all right? I think...</i>

28:33.694 --> 28:36.631
Oh, God.

28:36.731 --> 28:41.434
Carolyn, I was an idiot thinking
I could do this all alone.

28:41.534 --> 28:45.605
I wish you were here. I just miss you.

28:46.505 --> 28:48.430
I miss you.

29:36.385 --> 29:38.143
Oh, God!

29:41.958 --> 29:43.781
Hey!

33:00.813 --> 33:02.549
Sit down.

33:02.849 --> 33:04.673
Sit down.

33:07.285 --> 33:10.678
- We're gonna have a little talk.
- Come on, I didn't...

33:20.814 --> 33:23.183
- You got something to return?
- Come on, it's not like...

33:23.283 --> 33:25.034
- I didn't take anything!
- Come on?

33:25.134 --> 33:28.404
Look, I just... I got the rooms confused.

33:28.504 --> 33:31.273
- It happens, okay?
- Yeah, I'm not buying it.

33:31.373 --> 33:35.343
I'm sorry, you scared me.
You scared me shitless.

33:35.443 --> 33:38.159
Look, I just... it was a misunderstanding.

33:45.218 --> 33:46.887
Okay.

33:46.987 --> 33:49.878
Okay. Forget it.

33:51.122 --> 33:52.980
Okay.

34:10.139 --> 34:13.277
But, you know,
it was pretty freaky last night.

34:13.377 --> 34:17.313
- I wish I had a camera, you jumped so high.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

34:17.414 --> 34:21.784
- Just about to call the manager...
- You don't... you don't have to do that.

34:21.884 --> 34:25.000
It's fine. I'm just... just kidding.

34:26.221 --> 34:28.556
So, are you from around here or...

34:28.656 --> 34:32.143
- No.
- Just a vacation?

34:34.494 --> 34:36.661
- Yeah.
- Out by yourself?

34:36.762 --> 34:40.154
Not with like a group
or a wife or something?

34:41.998 --> 34:45.859
I see you're getting the ferry.

34:48.138 --> 34:51.206
- 11:00 a.m. to Seattle?
- 11:00 a.m. goes to Whittier.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.841
Yeah, no, yeah, Whittier.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.610
But it goes to Seattle after that, right?

34:56.710 --> 34:59.846
- Yeah, it goes to Seattle eventually.
- How we doin' over here?

34:59.946 --> 35:02.115
Anything else I can get you? More coffee?

35:02.215 --> 35:04.517
- Gonna have the check, please.
- Okay.

35:04.617 --> 35:06.519
Is that where you're from?

35:07.519 --> 35:09.887
That's where I live, yeah.

35:13.524 --> 35:17.321
Have you got a ferry schedule I can look at?

35:17.795 --> 35:20.957
Yeah, it's in my room,
maybe you can break in.

35:23.466 --> 35:25.340
- Here you go, have a great day.
- Thank you.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.620
The ferry leaves today...

35:28.537 --> 35:31.906
- and then again in two weeks.
- Two weeks?

35:32.006 --> 35:34.431
Yeah, two weeks.

35:50.755 --> 35:53.391
- Hi, folks, welcome aboard.
- <i>Bound for Whittier.</i>

35:53.491 --> 35:59.586
<i>Car ramp closes in 15 minutes

36:28.421 --> 36:31.058
<i>Kenz, it's me. Where are you?</i>

36:31.158 --> 36:35.595
<i>Look, if you did this on purpose,
that's okay. Just... just call me.</i>

36:36.195 --> 36:39.632
<i>Look, I saw the money missing
from the kitchen, okay?</i>

36:39.732 --> 36:41.316
<i>I'm sure you needed it, but...</i>

36:41.766 --> 36:44.435
<i>I'm not gonna go to the police,
I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

36:44.535 --> 36:47.538

36:47.638 --> 36:52.364

Let's go.

40:04.015 --> 40:05.885
Hey.

40:06.885 --> 40:08.586
What's up?

40:08.686 --> 40:11.855
Yeah, hey.

40:11.955 --> 40:15.291
- Nothing.
- Listen, I need a favor.

40:15.391 --> 40:17.559
Can I use your shower?

40:17.659 --> 40:21.929
I'm waiting for my room.
Like, it's just... it's just not ready.

40:22.929 --> 40:24.464
Bummer.

40:24.564 --> 40:26.826
My name's Jennifer.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.457
Hey, Jennifer.

40:30.835 --> 40:32.726
Tommy.

40:36.273 --> 40:38.098
Sorry.

40:41.678 --> 40:44.305
Shower's in the bathroom.

40:45.749 --> 40:47.551
Yeah.

40:48.251 --> 40:49.742
Makes sense.

41:19.546 --> 41:23.048
I washed my clothes,
so they're hanging in your bathroom.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.881
- Sorry.
- Hey, no worries.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.986
My turn.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.110
You can hang out.

41:32.255 --> 41:34.657
Don't steal my stuff?

41:34.757 --> 41:36.981
It's a deal.

42:01.013 --> 42:03.423
Guess you were tired.

42:04.117 --> 42:06.442
I'll just go check if my clothes are dry.

42:12.890 --> 42:16.183
So I'm... I'm headed out
early tomorrow morning.

42:20.963 --> 42:24.467
What are your plans? Where are you headed?

42:25.767 --> 42:28.103
I'm going to Seattle.

42:28.203 --> 42:30.171
You from there?

42:30.271 --> 42:33.541
Yeah. How about you?

42:34.341 --> 42:38.378
Backpacking to Denali.
I mean, I'm from Michigan.

42:38.478 --> 42:40.280
Yeah.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.971
Goin' through the park.

42:44.315 --> 42:46.218
That's cool.

42:46.318 --> 42:48.420
Can I see?

42:48.820 --> 42:51.344
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

42:53.255 --> 42:55.058
So...

42:56.358 --> 43:01.029
Okay, so we're gonna get
dropped off here at Kantishna,

43:01.129 --> 43:04.615
and then make our way down
to Mount McKinley,

43:04.715 --> 43:07.683
try and get a good view.
Anchorage is down here,

43:07.783 --> 43:13.143
and over here off the map is Seattle.

43:16.772 --> 43:19.107
So when do you fly out?

43:19.207 --> 43:21.344
I don't know.

43:21.744 --> 43:23.946
I might take a ferry out.

43:24.046 --> 43:27.082
Really? Ferry takes a while, no?

43:27.278 --> 43:29.451
Yeah, but...

43:29.551 --> 43:34.512
Hey, do you want me to just, like,
hold this room for you until you get back?

43:36.890 --> 43:38.758
- You're funny.
- Come on, why not?

43:38.858 --> 43:42.264
- It's expensive.
- Oh, well. I'm worth it.

43:43.094 --> 43:46.286
Well, just don't go on your trip. Stay here.

43:46.697 --> 43:49.031
But I want to go.
I've been planning this trip for...

43:49.131 --> 43:51.155
Just kidding.

43:54.968 --> 43:58.094
Hey, are you, like, in some kind
of trouble or something?

44:34.604 --> 44:35.828
You...

44:37.106 --> 44:40.631
- Hey. I'm sorry, I...
- Yo, Tommy, open up.

44:42.710 --> 44:45.579
- Whoa.
- Hey, Jennifer. Hey.

44:45.679 --> 44:48.181
Tommy, who is this?

44:48.281 --> 44:49.615
- All right.
- Jennifer.

44:49.715 --> 44:52.006
Tommy, who's that?

45:15.172 --> 45:16.974
<i>Kenzie.</i>

45:17.974 --> 45:20.532
<i>I wish I knew where you were.</i>

45:21.577 --> 45:25.202
<i>Listen, I... I don't know what else to do.</i>

45:26.947 --> 45:29.171
<i>I miss you.</i>

45:31.351 --> 45:33.175
<i>Fuck.</i>

46:18.262 --> 46:20.672
Fire is almost out.

46:21.098 --> 46:23.800
- It's gas.
- Drink, miss?

46:23.900 --> 46:26.869
- Yeah, an orange juice.
- No, she's fine.

46:26.969 --> 46:29.604
Just... yeah, sure. Bring her juice.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.028
Orange juice, got it.

46:33.574 --> 46:35.464
Thank you.

46:41.580 --> 46:43.662
So, what's your name?

46:45.316 --> 46:47.165
Jennifer.

46:49.253 --> 46:51.235
My name's Rene Bartlett.

46:52.055 --> 46:54.656
- Rene?
- Yes, it's French.

46:54.756 --> 46:57.606
Bart would be easier.

47:01.161 --> 47:02.610
<i>Oui.</i>

47:04.664 --> 47:08.535
So, Bart, what is your itinerary?

47:09.235 --> 47:11.584
My plans?

47:13.038 --> 47:16.288
I'm gonna hike through
the park for a few days.

47:18.342 --> 47:20.310
I'm...

47:20.410 --> 47:23.774
- I'm hiking around, too.
- Are you here by yourself?

47:27.015 --> 47:28.764
Yeah.

47:34.054 --> 47:36.456
Have you been here before?

47:36.856 --> 47:39.725
How long are you staying at this lodge?

47:39.825 --> 47:42.294
Tomorrow I start hiking, thank goodness.

47:42.394 --> 47:46.411
Get on the Denali bus,
and then I get off and hike.

47:47.798 --> 47:50.167
Hike and hike.

47:50.767 --> 47:54.337
Tents and backpacks and shit.

47:54.537 --> 47:58.807
- You know, I'm sorry, I'm not...
- You're taking the same bus as today?

47:58.907 --> 48:01.142
No, that's the bus that goes
to the visitors' center.

48:01.242 --> 48:03.845
I'm taking the bus that goes to Denali.

48:04.245 --> 48:06.127
What is Denali?

48:08.047 --> 48:10.616
It's the park...

48:10.716 --> 48:13.485
that's named for the mountain.

48:27.530 --> 48:30.765
<i>Good morning and welcome
to Denali National Park and Preserve.</i>

48:30.865 --> 48:36.103
<i>We're scheduled to drive into the Toklat
River, Mile 53, before we turn around.</i>

48:36.203 --> 48:41.173
<i>We'll be making stops along the way
for backpackers and day hikers.</i>

48:41.273 --> 48:43.275
<i>You're always welcome
to put the windows down.</i>

48:43.375 --> 48:46.178
<i>Sometimes you can even get a photograph.</i>

48:46.278 --> 48:49.014
<i>Use your binoculars, your cameras.</i>

48:49.114 --> 48:54.786
<i>If you guys have any questions at all
throughout the day, don't hesitate to ask.</i>

50:03.483 --> 50:05.419
Okay, folks, we're gonna load up.

50:05.519 --> 50:09.036
Next stop is Eielson,
about an hour from here.

50:32.410 --> 50:34.226
Bart?

50:36.879 --> 50:39.415
The bus just left. Hey!

50:39.515 --> 50:42.251
Hey! Hey!

50:42.351 --> 50:44.200
Hey!

51:10.609 --> 51:14.946
You're just gonna have
to walk the road back to...

51:15.646 --> 51:20.917
just to the park entrance. I mean,
you'll... you'll get a ride. There'll be...

51:21.217 --> 51:24.153
There'll be a bus here or somethin'.

51:24.253 --> 51:28.051
You should just stay on the road and...

51:32.892 --> 51:36.051
Not a problem. You'll be okay.

51:36.463 --> 51:38.300
You know...

51:40.200 --> 51:42.935
make a lot of noise
just for the bears, you know,

51:43.035 --> 51:46.304
and, well... I mean, you won't see
any bears. You'll be fine.

51:46.404 --> 51:48.706
You'll just...

51:48.806 --> 51:50.854
you'll be fine.

51:53.708 --> 51:56.659
Just... stick to the road.

52:22.536 --> 52:25.352
I'm not going back on the road.

52:27.072 --> 52:31.009
- You don't have a choice.
- I'm hiking, too.

52:31.109 --> 52:33.824
Seriously, there's the road.

52:36.812 --> 52:38.881
What... what are you doing?

52:38.981 --> 52:42.817
Listen, you know what? It's rude.

52:42.917 --> 52:45.686
It's rude to intentionally
follow other hikers.

52:45.786 --> 52:48.055
There's a code...

52:48.655 --> 52:50.904
of privacy.

52:58.796 --> 53:00.679
Okay...

53:03.032 --> 53:06.102
I'll wait with you. We'll, just...

53:06.202 --> 53:08.371
I'll wait with you.

53:08.771 --> 53:12.674
We'll just go back up to the road,
and if it takes an hour, it takes an hour,

53:12.774 --> 53:14.710
it takes two hours,

53:16.010 --> 53:18.262
fine, okay?

53:18.362 --> 53:19.546
Come on.

53:19.846 --> 53:22.730
Get off of me. Get the fuck off me.

53:39.498 --> 53:41.880
I'm gonna wait by the road.

56:50.478 --> 56:53.881
You also just happen to be
stopping here for the night.

56:53.981 --> 56:55.983
Is that it?

56:56.483 --> 56:58.143
Yeah.

57:13.263 --> 57:16.380
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- To eat dinner.

58:03.644 --> 58:06.046
We eat a hundred yards from the tent.
We don't make fires.

58:06.146 --> 58:09.337
I cook on a stove
and there are no marshmallows.

58:10.716 --> 58:14.152
Don't spill food on yourself,
don't break any branches,

58:14.252 --> 58:19.570
don't step on any flowers, and just leave
everything the way you found it.

58:23.392 --> 58:25.595
This is bear spray.

58:25.695 --> 58:31.327
Hold onto it. Never approach
a bear or a moose or whatever.

58:31.427 --> 58:34.636
Don't approach them.
If a bear charges you, then...

58:34.736 --> 58:38.019
- I know what I'm doing.
- You have no idea.

58:39.906 --> 58:43.911
But whatever you do, don't run.

58:44.611 --> 58:46.726
Do not run.

58:48.412 --> 58:52.863
- Don't run.
- Don't run. Got it.

58:58.686 --> 59:01.068
All right, here. Eat.

01:00:11.387 --> 01:00:13.824
Morning, Jennifer.

01:00:14.324 --> 01:00:18.867
Just beginning to wonder if your
disappearance was a problem or a solution.

01:00:20.427 --> 01:00:23.744
Bart? My name's Mackenzie.

01:00:25.464 --> 01:00:29.335
- What?
- My name's not Jennifer, it's Mackenzie.

01:00:37.908 --> 01:00:39.791
Whatever.

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:45.996
Want some breakfast?

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:59.499
Get under the tarp.

01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:12.364
This is fuckin' cool, this setup.

01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:16.880
- So now we...
- We wait. Stop swearing.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.139
Find the smallest one. See that
smallest one? Right by your right foot.

01:02:43.489 --> 01:02:46.425
Roll it up, stick it in here.
That's right, yeah.

01:02:46.525 --> 01:02:48.974
Just take the end of that little hole.

01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:59.435
<i>You know, I do actually like the outdoors.</i>

01:02:59.535 --> 01:03:02.051
Something in common.

01:03:16.448 --> 01:03:18.731
Everything's wet.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:22.521
It's not wet. It's just...

01:03:24.021 --> 01:03:28.671
damp. Just leave it on.
It'll dry faster that way.

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.274
Okay.

01:03:38.298 --> 01:03:40.647
Even the cards are old.

01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:47.652
I've had them a long time.

01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:51.428
- Jesus, Bart.
- Don't... don't move. Don't move.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.017
It's okay.

01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:15.149
Slowly, it's okay.

01:05:15.249 --> 01:05:17.065
Slowly.

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:30.511
Look at it.

01:05:41.374 --> 01:05:43.423
Come on.

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:19.322
Who's Carolyn?

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.901
She was my wife.

01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:37.171
She died last year.

01:06:39.657 --> 01:06:41.540
I'm sorry.

01:06:43.793 --> 01:06:45.714
We honeymooned up here.

01:06:46.797 --> 01:06:53.102
Flipped a coin.
Heads, we'd go to Alaska, tails, Mexico.

01:06:53.202 --> 01:06:58.140
It was just kind
of a dumb idea, really, but...

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.190
then we just kept coming back here.

01:07:08.848 --> 01:07:11.451
Guess you're by yourself now she's...

01:07:11.551 --> 01:07:14.134
We didn't have kids, so...

01:07:21.592 --> 01:07:24.076
My dad died last year.

01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:33.050
I'm sorry, too, then.

01:07:34.169 --> 01:07:38.320
It's fine. It's okay. I'm fine.

01:07:41.774 --> 01:07:44.010
Your wife...

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.292
how'd she die?

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:54.919
Cancer.

01:07:55.719 --> 01:07:58.201
She had it a while.

01:07:59.421 --> 01:08:04.407
I knew it, I felt it... something.

01:08:09.463 --> 01:08:14.334
And she wanted to go south to see
her family and come up here.

01:08:14.434 --> 01:08:18.305
I... I said no.

01:08:18.904 --> 01:08:22.809
'Cause of the... the treatments...

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:26.444
which was stupid because...
all the treatments pretty much failed.

01:08:26.545 --> 01:08:29.861
They all... everything failed.

01:08:31.913 --> 01:08:35.299
And she didn't get a chance
to come back up here...

01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:41.237
didn't see her family.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:51.249
I told myself that it was
because I was afraid to scare her...

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:54.018
but really...

01:08:55.568 --> 01:08:59.071
it was because I was afraid
to watch her say her goodbyes

01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:02.087
because I just didn't want it to be real.

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:10.260
But it was real.

01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:24.406
Do you think she's still here?

01:09:28.194 --> 01:09:30.510
That would be nice.

01:10:22.746 --> 01:10:24.696
You're awake.

01:10:57.613 --> 01:10:59.215
Get off.

01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:02.732
God, what are you... what are you doing?

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:10.257
Jesus Christ.

01:11:10.357 --> 01:11:14.740
Now what the hell gave you that idea?
I... How old are you, really?

01:11:16.226 --> 01:11:18.743
God, Jesus.

01:11:28.871 --> 01:11:31.508
I don't... I don't need this...

01:11:31.608 --> 01:11:34.725
whatever this is.

01:11:37.646 --> 01:11:39.696
I don't need it.

01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:28.331
I rented a car, do you want
to go get a bite to eat?

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:31.700
Yeah.

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:52.772
How about some more
hot water for that tea?

01:13:52.872 --> 01:13:56.022
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:04.582
Will you get me just an oatmeal and...

01:14:04.682 --> 01:14:06.564
and...

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:10.921
I have to go to the bathroom,
I'll be back in just a...

01:15:55.047 --> 01:15:56.916
<i>Kenz?</i>

01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:58.917
Let me talk to Mom.

01:15:59.017 --> 01:16:02.620
- <i>Oh, thank God, are you okay?</i>
- I want to talk to her!

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.889
<i>Just let me come and get you,
and we'll go see her.</i>

01:16:04.989 --> 01:16:07.724
You fucking lied to me!
What did you tell her?

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:12.743
<i>I didn't tell her what happened.
I didn't want her to think bad of you.</i>

01:16:14.563 --> 01:16:17.126
<i>I think we screwed up.</i>

01:16:18.266 --> 01:16:21.217
<i>You must be feeling the same way.</i>

01:16:24.238 --> 01:16:28.824
<i>You know, you're the only one
I can talk to about this, just you.</i>

01:16:29.909 --> 01:16:33.380
<i>I know you feel like I broke
your trust, and...</i>

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.249
<i>I'm sorry for that,
but this is for both of us, Kenz.</i>

01:16:36.349 --> 01:16:40.186
<i>For you and me, so,
please just think about it.</i>

01:16:40.286 --> 01:16:42.788
<i>We're in this together.</i>

01:16:42.888 --> 01:16:47.039
<i>Just you and me, so we have
to trust each other, okay?</i>

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:51.294
<i>So come back
and I'll do whatever you need.</i>

01:16:51.394 --> 01:16:53.963
- <i>I'll take care of you...</i>
- I don't need your help.

01:16:54.063 --> 01:16:57.683
- I've got someone who's helping me.
- <i>Who? Who did you meet?</i>

01:16:57.783 --> 01:17:01.503
<i>Kenzie, listen to me,
right now, you need to be very...</i>

01:17:01.603 --> 01:17:04.532
<i>You need to get away from this person,
and you need to stay by yourself</i>

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:07.875
- <i>and let me come and get you.</i>
- I think you're scared!

01:17:07.975 --> 01:17:11.244
<i>Yeah, I'm scared for you.
I'm scared something will happen to you.</i>

01:17:11.344 --> 01:17:13.879
<i>I'm scared you're gonna get in trouble.</i>

01:17:13.979 --> 01:17:19.535
<i>You're by yourself right now. Listen,
you need to be very careful right now.</i>

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.065
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:17:27.274 --> 01:17:29.677
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

01:17:30.327 --> 01:17:34.197
<i>Just tell me where you are and I'll send
some money so you can get around, okay?</i>

01:17:34.297 --> 01:17:36.365
Look, I have money.

01:17:36.465 --> 01:17:38.967
I can just get anywhere,
I could get a ferry...

01:17:39.067 --> 01:17:41.219
<i>Okay, let's meet on the ferry.</i>

01:17:41.319 --> 01:17:44.822
- <i>The next one to Juneau.</i>
- What? No, I didn't say that.

01:17:44.922 --> 01:17:47.574
<i>Kenzie, I know where you are.</i>

01:17:47.674 --> 01:17:50.009
<i>The police, they called me.</i>

01:17:50.109 --> 01:17:52.844
<i>So just stay there, okay?
And I'll be there in a few hours.</i>

01:17:52.944 --> 01:17:54.993
<i>No police...</i>

01:18:40.688 --> 01:18:43.238
Bart! Bart!

01:18:44.526 --> 01:18:46.815
Open the door!

01:18:48.162 --> 01:18:51.064
- I don't... Mackenzie...
- Drive, just drive.

01:18:51.164 --> 01:18:54.247
Just fucking drive, you don't understand!

01:18:54.832 --> 01:18:57.502
You think you do, but you don't!

01:18:58.002 --> 01:19:01.505
Why won't you listen to me? I'm trying.

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:05.454
Please, just drive.

01:21:00.848 --> 01:21:02.984
Why are we stopping?

01:21:03.084 --> 01:21:04.967
Rest stop.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.044
Oh, hey, sorry about that!

01:22:06.144 --> 01:22:09.180
Probably shouldn't have been
flying so close to the road,

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.178
but usually it's pretty desolate.
Sorry about that.

01:22:12.278 --> 01:22:15.084
- Yeah, apologies.
- How you guys doing?

01:22:15.184 --> 01:22:16.852
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:22:16.952 --> 01:22:18.770
- Hey.
- Fly kites out here?

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.956
Nice kite?
Doesn't look like there's any damage.

01:22:22.056 --> 01:22:26.654
- You got car trouble? Is it all right?
- No, we're fine. Well...

01:22:26.754 --> 01:22:30.528
we're low on gas, actually, you know if
there's a gas station in either direction?

01:22:30.628 --> 01:22:34.598
No, to tell you the truth,
I have no idea. We flew in.

01:22:34.698 --> 01:22:38.635
We have some gas though, back at the camp.
You got a can, you want to follow?

01:22:38.735 --> 01:22:42.071
- A can, no, actually.
- That's all right, we got one.

01:22:42.171 --> 01:22:44.472
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hi.

01:22:44.572 --> 01:22:47.574
- Masafumi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

01:22:47.674 --> 01:22:50.057
- Mackenzie.
- Jennifer.

01:23:03.388 --> 01:23:06.172
- Hi, Rene.
- Ide.

01:23:08.726 --> 01:23:11.042
Peel that for me.

01:23:14.563 --> 01:23:19.001
- So, are you from Alaska?
- No, I'm from Minnesota.

01:23:19.101 --> 01:23:21.014
Josh is from Alaska, though.

01:23:21.114 --> 01:23:25.038
Masafumi is Seattle, and Ide is Japan.

01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:28.155
We're testing kites.

01:23:30.508 --> 01:23:32.945
So where are you and your... daughter?

01:23:33.045 --> 01:23:37.214
- Niece. Niece.
- Where are you guys headed?

01:23:37.314 --> 01:23:40.683
Well, we're taking a little vacation,
we've been all over,

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:43.052
went to Denali and...

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:46.636
Spend the night,
take you up flying tomorrow.

01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:50.792
No, no, we don't...
we don't want to intrude.

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:54.176
You're not intruding,
spend the night. I mean it.

01:24:01.067 --> 01:24:02.907
Hey.

01:24:05.969 --> 01:24:08.005
Come on in.

01:24:09.407 --> 01:24:11.238
Come on.

01:24:13.609 --> 01:24:15.650
Here you go.

01:24:21.449 --> 01:24:25.053
- You know Josh, the pilot guy?
- Yeah?

01:24:25.153 --> 01:24:27.822
Built this fucking thing
right in his garage.

01:24:27.922 --> 01:24:31.926
Believe that? I wish he'd build me one.

01:24:32.726 --> 01:24:35.662
- You ever been up in one of these?
- No.

01:24:35.762 --> 01:24:37.330
No? Never had a chance?

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:40.666
Oh, you were scared? That's cool,
I was scared in the beginning.

01:24:40.766 --> 01:24:44.944
- Gotta get over that shit though...
- No, no, I'm not scared.

01:24:45.636 --> 01:24:48.653
Oh, okay. That's cool.

01:24:52.374 --> 01:24:54.677
Hey, how far can these things fly?

01:24:54.777 --> 01:24:58.447
Could this go, like...
all the way to Seattle?

01:24:58.547 --> 01:25:00.649
Why, you ready to go home?

01:25:00.749 --> 01:25:03.058
Oh, it's no reason.

01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:07.514
Well...

01:25:07.614 --> 01:25:10.525
my place in question is Minnesota.

01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:15.175
My mother's there,
and she is a piece of work.

01:25:16.261 --> 01:25:20.179
I couldn't fly this thing there,
and let me tell you, I wouldn't want to.

01:25:23.967 --> 01:25:26.803
- How old are you?
- I'm 14.

01:25:26.903 --> 01:25:29.619
You're 14, oh, my God.

01:25:31.139 --> 01:25:34.343
That's funny. 14 years old.

01:25:34.743 --> 01:25:37.746
What was I doing, 14 years old?

01:25:38.046 --> 01:25:41.663
Oh, I was... I was learning to shoot.

01:25:42.448 --> 01:25:44.084
Yeah.

01:25:44.184 --> 01:25:47.500
We had lots of wolves
running around and black bear.

01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:50.555
Yeah.

01:25:51.155 --> 01:25:53.838
That's what I was doing in that summer.

01:25:57.710 --> 01:25:59.779
So you're probably...

01:25:59.879 --> 01:26:03.429
ready to get back to the city?

01:26:03.964 --> 01:26:07.015
This'll all be over before you know it.

01:26:12.505 --> 01:26:16.723
- Okay, it's gusty here.
- Okay, you ready?

01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:27.018
<i>So...</i>

01:26:27.118 --> 01:26:29.853
<i>what's with all the kites and stuff?</i>

01:26:29.953 --> 01:26:32.839
I grew up in a family
with three boys, and...

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:36.910
<i>my father used to bring kites
from Japan for us to fly, and...</i>

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:41.691
my older brother, Gus,
he and I would go outside and...

01:26:41.791 --> 01:26:45.180
fly all day, almost every day.

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:48.304
One moment I was holding his hand, and...

01:26:50.303 --> 01:26:52.986
he got hit by a car and killed.

01:26:55.808 --> 01:26:59.692
<i>Then I stopped talking
and never went back to school.</i>

01:27:00.545 --> 01:27:04.286
<i>One day, my dad, he yells
out to me to come outside, and...</i>

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.484
<i>he was out there flying a kite.</i>

01:27:06.584 --> 01:27:09.753
<i>Takes my hand and tries
to put it on the string, and...</i>

01:27:09.853 --> 01:27:12.722
<i>I told him I was scared.</i>

01:27:12.822 --> 01:27:17.092
<i>And he told me, the wind's like life,
it's always changing.</i>

01:27:17.192 --> 01:27:19.260
<i>And the strings there,</i>

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.679
<i>they're like the feelings
that connect us to our family,</i>

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:25.195
<i>you know, to the people we love.</i>

01:27:26.632 --> 01:27:29.626
<i>To the flyers.</i>

01:27:31.636 --> 01:27:34.653
I've been flying kites ever since.

01:29:11.194 --> 01:29:13.871
A ferry to Seattle...

01:29:15.232 --> 01:29:19.069
goes through Juneau, leaves from Whittier,
leaves tomorrow afternoon.

01:29:19.169 --> 01:29:23.286
If you leave in the morning, you can
make it. Is that what you want to do?

01:29:26.573 --> 01:29:28.356
Yeah.

01:29:28.774 --> 01:29:30.591
Yeah.

01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:34.997
- Are you gonna tell me what...
- I can't tell you.

01:29:35.097 --> 01:29:39.036
- What about the police?
- What about them?

01:30:22.724 --> 01:30:24.910
Hot chocolate.

01:30:58.022 --> 01:31:00.444
Thank you very much.

01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:12.301
<i>Passengers for Akutan, Juneau, Sitka,</i>

01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:16.685
<i>Bellingham, Seattle,
keep your tickets on you.</i>

01:32:20.467 --> 01:32:22.337
Sorry.

01:32:44.087 --> 01:32:46.956
- Where'd my partner get to?
- Jennifer just took the binoculars

01:32:47.056 --> 01:32:48.905
and went out on the deck.

01:33:05.603 --> 01:33:07.924
Excuse me for a sec.

01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:06.499
Bart!

01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:11.081
- Can we go to the room?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:34:24.178 --> 01:34:26.074
You left this.

01:34:42.928 --> 01:34:46.180
Well, I guess we should
get you back to Seattle.

01:34:51.435 --> 01:34:54.538
- You know, I can go to the police for you...
- And what for?

01:34:54.638 --> 01:34:58.489
- Mackenzie.
- What? It doesn't matter, okay?

01:34:59.775 --> 01:35:02.245
Nothing happened.

01:35:02.345 --> 01:35:04.514
Okay? Nothing happened.

01:35:05.214 --> 01:35:07.063
Okay?

01:36:24.556 --> 01:36:30.151
<i>Juneau. This is Juneau.

<i>All passengers waiting

01:36:44.803 --> 01:36:47.539

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:26.112
Bart! Bart.

01:37:26.572 --> 01:37:29.241
Why didn't you stay in the cabin?

01:37:29.341 --> 01:37:30.990
Don't look.

01:37:54.094 --> 01:37:56.265
What are you doing,
you wrote a text on my phone?

01:37:56.365 --> 01:37:59.401
- Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
- What are you talking about?

01:37:59.501 --> 01:38:01.717
You got the map?

01:38:02.902 --> 01:38:04.815
- It's in my bag.
- Okay,

01:38:04.915 --> 01:38:08.473
- I'm getting off here, you're staying.
- What? No, Bart, he's gone...

01:38:08.573 --> 01:38:10.689
No, you're staying.

01:38:12.809 --> 01:38:15.678
- I'm gonna come with you then.
- No, you're not.

01:38:15.778 --> 01:38:16.846
- I am...
- This is it.

01:38:16.946 --> 01:38:20.215
You're gonna stay on the ferry
until it gets to Seattle.

01:38:20.315 --> 01:38:24.185
- I'm gonna follow you anyway.
- Follow me, I'll turn you in.

01:38:24.585 --> 01:38:26.353
You're not listening to me,
I'm not gonna...

01:38:26.453 --> 01:38:28.306
No.

01:38:29.055 --> 01:38:31.365
No, you're staying on the ferry.

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.319
