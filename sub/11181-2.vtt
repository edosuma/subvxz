WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:04.073
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.211 --> 00:06.937
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.076 --> 00:11.597
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.735 --> 00:14.531
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.669 --> 00:17.431
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.569 --> 00:21.538
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.264 --> 00:25.646
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.784 --> 00:28.304
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.442 --> 00:30.892
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.031 --> 00:33.619
Just to get up that hill

00:33.757 --> 00:36.139
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.277 --> 00:38.728
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:38.866 --> 00:41.248
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.386 --> 00:42.973
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.112 --> 00:45.735
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:45.873 --> 00:48.772
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:48.910 --> 00:53.294
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.432 --> 00:56.159
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.297 --> 00:59.162
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.300 --> 01:04.685
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:19.562 --> 01:22.047
You know, Pop, I still
think we should call the cops.
No!

01:22.185 --> 01:24.118
But, Pop...
Do you wanna see
your mother alive?

01:24.256 --> 01:26.189
Well, sure I do...
Then no cops!

01:26.327 --> 01:29.227
Look, the kidnappers told me,
"Get $100,000, go home,
wait by the phone.

01:29.365 --> 01:31.884
And don't call the cops."
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

01:32.022 --> 01:34.853
George, the police are
professionals. They know
how to handle these things.

01:34.991 --> 01:36.958
They wouldn't do anything
to jeopardize Louise.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.615
Then how come they let
her get kidnapped?

01:38.753 --> 01:40.410
Well, they...
Oh, be reasonable.

01:40.548 --> 01:42.930
Look, no cops
and that's final!

01:43.068 --> 01:45.312
I wonder where my banker
is with the money?

01:45.450 --> 01:47.348
Well, I wish there was
something we could do.

01:47.486 --> 01:49.661
All this waiting is
driving me crazy.

01:49.799 --> 01:52.802
Maybe I ought to call
the jeweler and see if
Louise was there.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.459
What good is that gonna do?

01:54.597 --> 01:57.634
Well, he might have noticed
something, a clue perhaps.
A clue? Like what?

01:57.772 --> 02:00.810
Well, like a man grabbing
your wife and kidnapping her.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.055
I'm gonna call.

02:05.194 --> 02:06.988
Don't touch that phone!
The kidnappers might be
trying to call!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.749
Oh, we can call
from my apartment.

02:08.887 --> 02:10.716
Good idea.
We'll be right back.

02:13.063 --> 02:15.135
Oh, man, this is like
a bad dream.

02:15.273 --> 02:17.689
I just wish I could
get my hands on that
honky that grabbed Weezy.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.242
Honky?

02:21.520 --> 02:22.935
How do you know he's white?

02:23.073 --> 02:24.730
'Cause he had a white accent!

02:27.802 --> 02:31.358
I'm just glad I got the money.
If we was poor, Weezy would
really be in trouble.

02:31.496 --> 02:33.567
If we were poor,
Mom wouldn't
have been kidnapped.

02:33.705 --> 02:36.052
But why me? There are
a lot of rich guys
in this city.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.365
Oh, yeah, Pop, but they don't
go around advertising it.

02:38.503 --> 02:41.299
Look, when you run your own
business, you gotta advertise
to make money!

02:41.437 --> 02:43.370
And to make Mom
a target for kidnappers!

02:43.508 --> 02:44.716
Don't push me!

02:47.097 --> 02:48.098
Dang.

02:51.723 --> 02:52.896
Pop, I'm sorry.

02:54.104 --> 02:56.003
Uh, I'll make coffee.

02:56.141 --> 02:57.625
I'll help you.

02:57.763 --> 03:01.595
That's a good idea.
I need something to
calm my nerves.

03:03.769 --> 03:06.289
Mother Jefferson, coffee
doesn't calm the nerves.

03:06.427 --> 03:09.741
No. Well then,
maybe you better make me
a Bloody Mary.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.576
Your mother's one
in a million, Lionel.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.545
I remember right after
you were born,

03:20.683 --> 03:24.721
I didn't have no job,
couldn't find none,
no matter how hard I tied.

03:24.859 --> 03:27.068
Then Weezy went out
and got a job,

03:27.207 --> 03:29.485
came home and worked all day

03:29.623 --> 03:31.901
took care of you and me,
mostly me,

03:32.039 --> 03:34.628
'cause I was climbing
the walls by then.

03:34.766 --> 03:38.183
But she never complained.
Any other woman
would've split out on me.

03:39.564 --> 03:42.463
Hey, I never realized how
much I loved her till now.

03:42.601 --> 03:45.673
Like they say,
"You never miss the water
till the well runs dry."

03:45.811 --> 03:48.228
Huh! I know what
that means now.

03:48.366 --> 03:51.196
I mean, she means
everything to me,
Lionel. Everything.

03:52.128 --> 03:53.957
I don't know,

03:54.095 --> 03:56.408
all this money wouldn't mean
nothing if I ain't got Weezy
to share it with.

03:56.546 --> 03:58.824
If anything happens
to her, Lionel,
I don't know, I...

03:58.962 --> 04:01.724
Hey, Pop, look we just
gotta think positive,
okay?

04:01.862 --> 04:03.208
Because Mom's gonna be fine.

04:03.346 --> 04:05.417
Why didn't they kidnap me?
Why'd they have to grab Weezy?

04:05.555 --> 04:07.661
George you've got
to have faith.

04:07.799 --> 04:09.835
Louise is in God's hands.

04:09.973 --> 04:12.355
No, she's not, Mom.
She's in the kidnappers'
hands!

04:12.493 --> 04:15.358
There's no telling
what they might do.

04:15.496 --> 04:17.740
Anybody that's crazy enough
to kidnap somebody
in broad...

04:17.878 --> 04:19.155
What's that?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.985
Pop. Now, just take it easy,
it's just the doorbell.

04:22.123 --> 04:23.746
Maybe it's the banker!

04:23.884 --> 04:25.368
Oh, did you talk
to the jeweler?

04:25.506 --> 04:28.129
Yes. He said Louise
picked up the watch and
left about an hour ago.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.615
Oh, this is awful!
Take is easy, Mama.

04:30.753 --> 04:33.100
Well, they've got
your watch, too!

04:37.207 --> 04:39.002
Ah, Mr. Jefferson,

04:39.140 --> 04:41.488
if your wife left
the jewelry store an hour ago,

04:41.626 --> 04:44.145
and the kidnappers
phoned your office
a half an hour ago,

04:44.284 --> 04:47.597
then they can't have had
Mrs. Jefferson for more than
30 minutes when they phoned.

04:47.735 --> 04:49.634
So what?
Well, let's say it took
them two minutes

04:49.772 --> 04:51.601
to get Mrs. Jefferson
into their car

04:51.739 --> 04:55.018
and perhaps four minutes
to get her from the car to
where they're keeping her.

04:55.156 --> 04:57.676
That leaves 24 minutes
traveling time.

04:57.814 --> 05:01.784
The kidnappers are holding
Mrs. Jefferson within one
mile of the jewelry store.

05:01.922 --> 05:03.406
Mm.
How do you know that?

05:03.544 --> 05:05.512
Oh, it's elementary.
In rush hour traffic,
in this city,

05:05.650 --> 05:08.515
you can't get further
than a mile in 24 minutes.

05:08.653 --> 05:11.034
It's Saturday, Bentley.
Ain't no rush hour today.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.071
They could be in
Jersey by now!

05:13.209 --> 05:16.281
Drat! If it were a weekday,
we would have had them!

05:16.419 --> 05:19.042
I'm afraid we're dealing
with professionals, Mr. J.

05:19.871 --> 05:21.113
Where's that coffee?

05:21.251 --> 05:22.322
It's coming up!

05:25.048 --> 05:26.429
Well, that ought to do it.

05:33.298 --> 05:36.715
Boy, this is gonna be
a long day.

05:36.853 --> 05:38.338
Will you get me a diet soda?

05:39.615 --> 05:41.133
A diet soda?

05:41.271 --> 05:42.997
I have to watch my weight.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.243
Daddy, how can you eat
at a time like this?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.969
I always eat when I'm nervous.

05:49.107 --> 05:50.522
You can say that again.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.731
I remember when
I was in labor with you.

05:52.869 --> 05:56.873
Your daddy brought me
some candy. Well, all I
got were the wrappers.

05:57.011 --> 05:58.806
That's right.
When you were born,

05:58.944 --> 06:01.775
your mother lost eight pounds
and I gained 10.

06:02.879 --> 06:05.641
Was there any luck with
the jeweler, Mama?
No.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.643
Oh, I feel terrible.

06:07.781 --> 06:10.715
If only I had picked up
George's watch.

06:10.853 --> 06:13.407
Mama, there was nothing
you could do. The watch
wasn't ready.

06:13.545 --> 06:16.479
But I should have gone back
to the store with Louise.

06:17.584 --> 06:20.449
This is all my fault.
Oh, Mama don't.

06:20.587 --> 06:22.727
Oh, take it easy, Helen.

06:22.865 --> 06:25.177
Daddy's right. The only thing
we can do is wait.

06:25.315 --> 06:29.458
That's right. And the most
important thing is that
we all stay calm.

06:29.596 --> 06:31.529
The phone! The phone!

06:36.257 --> 06:37.431
It's the kidnappers.

06:37.569 --> 06:40.330
It's 4:22. Repeat everything
they say, Mr. J,

06:40.469 --> 06:43.955
and I'll write it down so that
we can tell the police later.

06:44.265 --> 06:45.543
Hello?

06:45.681 --> 06:47.303
Yeah, this is
George Jefferson.

06:48.304 --> 06:49.512
What?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.550
Three dance lessons
for $14.95?

06:52.688 --> 06:55.587
"Three dance lessons
for $14.95."

06:56.346 --> 06:58.038
No, I am not interested!

06:58.176 --> 07:01.075
And don't be calling on
my phone again or I'll
dance on your head!

07:04.493 --> 07:05.597
Why don't they call?

07:05.735 --> 07:07.047
Yeah, what's takin' them
so long?

07:11.569 --> 07:13.260
Good afternoon.
I'm Mr. Billings.

07:13.398 --> 07:15.987
Oh, yeah, please, come in.
We've been waiting for you.
You got the money?

07:16.125 --> 07:17.229
It's all here.
Good, gimme.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.508
Ahh ah! Ugh! Please!

07:19.646 --> 07:21.302
Mr. Jefferson, be patient!

07:23.581 --> 07:26.031
It's all right, Billings.
They're all friends.

07:27.516 --> 07:29.518
Or relatives.

07:29.656 --> 07:33.418
Before I give you the money,
Mr. Jefferson, I'll need
your John Hancock.

07:33.556 --> 07:36.283
What do you want with
my life insurance?
Huh?

07:38.837 --> 07:40.701
Uh... No, no, no.

07:40.839 --> 07:43.739
Just put your signature
on these loan forms.

07:43.877 --> 07:46.189
Why didn't you say signature?
Huh!

07:47.087 --> 07:49.089
There you are.

07:49.227 --> 07:53.231
Now this gives the bank
the right to impound all your
personal and business property

07:53.369 --> 07:55.371
in case something happens.
Like what?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.373
Like the police don't get
the money back.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.479
See, George, I told you...
Shut up, Willis!

07:59.617 --> 08:01.135
And this form is
for our files.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.206
It certifies that...
Billings, just show me
where to sign!

08:03.344 --> 08:06.002
Please. I'm just trying
to be helpful. There's no
need to get excited.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.418
Oh, no? Has your wife
ever been kidnapped?

08:09.696 --> 08:10.662
No.

08:14.114 --> 08:15.736
Leslie, the keys.

08:21.915 --> 08:25.056
There you are,
Mr. Jefferson. $100,000.

08:25.194 --> 08:27.610
Now, I must call security
and let them know
I arrived safely.

08:27.748 --> 08:30.406
May I use your phone?
Not that one.
I'm expecting a call.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.166
You can use the pay phone
down in the lobby.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.824
Oh, of course. Do you
have a dime?

08:37.620 --> 08:39.346
I never carry cash.

08:40.658 --> 08:41.659
Here.

08:41.797 --> 08:42.763
Thanks.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.319
Oh, I'll credit this
to your account.

08:49.701 --> 08:52.773
Well, here it is.
$100,000.

08:52.911 --> 08:54.154
ALL: Ooh...

08:54.292 --> 08:56.708
I've never seen
so much money before.

08:56.846 --> 08:59.918
George, it's a good thing
they kidnapped Louise.

09:02.093 --> 09:04.095
What are you
talking about, Mama?

09:04.233 --> 09:06.580
Just think how much
they would be asking

09:06.718 --> 09:08.375
if they'd kidnapped me.

09:11.930 --> 09:14.105
I'm going to call the cops.
Don't touch the phone!

09:14.243 --> 09:16.176
Oh, damn it, Pop,
this is my mother
we're talking about!

09:16.314 --> 09:18.419
You know I care just as much
about her safety as you do.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.283
Well, if you care,
don't call the cops!

09:20.421 --> 09:22.078
Well, look, Pop,
there's $100,000.

09:29.258 --> 09:31.018
What are you all doing here?

09:35.713 --> 09:37.680
Well, I went back to
the office and...

09:37.818 --> 09:39.302
Weezy!

09:44.376 --> 09:46.102
What's all this kissing for?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.070
You here, in our
living room, Weezy!

09:49.554 --> 09:52.143
You never act like this
in our bedroom!

09:53.351 --> 09:54.352
Oh, Mom!

09:55.560 --> 09:57.424
What in the world...

09:58.287 --> 09:59.978
Oh, Louise.

10:00.876 --> 10:03.085
Baby, baby.
Baby. Baby.

10:05.466 --> 10:07.848
Now I know something's wrong.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.644
Hey, Mom, tell us,
how'd you get away?

10:10.782 --> 10:12.612
Did they let you go?
Can you identify them?

10:12.750 --> 10:14.821
Was one of them a honky,
I mean white?

10:17.962 --> 10:20.067
What are you all
talking about?

10:20.205 --> 10:21.897
The kidnappers!

10:22.035 --> 10:23.657
Kidnappers? What kidnappers?

10:23.795 --> 10:25.141
The ones that grabbed you.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.282
You thought I was kidnapped?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.181
Well, wasn't you?

10:30.319 --> 10:32.873
Why would anybody want me?

10:33.011 --> 10:35.980
That's what I've been
asking myself for years.

10:39.742 --> 10:43.194
Hey, Mom, now look,
somebody called Pop's office

10:43.332 --> 10:46.024
and they demanded $100,000
ransom for you.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.786
A hundred thousand dollars?

10:48.924 --> 10:51.443
George, where would you get
that kind of money?

10:51.581 --> 10:52.824
Right here.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.278
My stars!

10:58.416 --> 11:00.487
Oh, I feel faint.
Weezy, what's wrong?

11:01.246 --> 11:03.317
Me, kidnapped!

11:03.455 --> 11:05.078
Well, you ain't kidnapped!

11:05.216 --> 11:07.114
But just the thought...

11:07.252 --> 11:09.979
Those gangsters grabbing me
and hurting me...

11:10.117 --> 11:13.224
Oh, George, I'm so glad
you're here to protect me!

11:14.501 --> 11:17.607
But who's gonna protect me
from you?

11:17.746 --> 11:20.300
It looks like you were
the victim of a hoax,
George.

11:20.438 --> 11:23.683
What kind of person would
make a crank call like that?

11:23.821 --> 11:25.029
A crank!

11:26.444 --> 11:28.170
A sick crank!

11:28.308 --> 11:31.483
Well, now that I know
George's watch is safe,

11:31.621 --> 11:33.589
I'm going to take a nap.

11:37.179 --> 11:41.217
Helen! The watch was supposed
to be a surprise.

11:41.355 --> 11:43.564
But I had to tell them
where you went, Louise.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.603
Don't worry about it, Weezy.
Having you back safe and sound
is the best surprise ever.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.432
Mr. Jefferson,

11:50.399 --> 11:52.401
do you have any enemies?

11:52.539 --> 11:55.024
Enemies?
I mean, is there anyone
who doesn't like you?

11:55.162 --> 11:57.371
Are you kidding?
Who wouldn't like me?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.477
Well, let's go alphabetically.

12:02.618 --> 12:05.034
Oh, George, here's your watch.

12:05.172 --> 12:06.277
Surprise!

12:06.415 --> 12:10.177
Oh, thank you.
Hey, that's great!

12:10.315 --> 12:12.248
Uh, read what's
on the back.

12:12.386 --> 12:14.492
Oh, shockproof, waterproof...

12:14.630 --> 12:15.735
George!

12:16.839 --> 12:18.116
The inscription!

12:20.360 --> 12:24.157
"To George. The man I love
to make time with. Louise."

12:28.126 --> 12:32.441
Mrs. Jefferson, could
the person who phoned be
someone who had it in for you?

12:32.579 --> 12:34.167
Oh, no, I...

12:35.478 --> 12:37.411
Wait a minute!

12:38.067 --> 12:39.241
George?

12:39.379 --> 12:42.209
Where was your mother
when you got that call?

12:42.347 --> 12:44.453
Uh. Oh, come on, Weezy.

12:44.591 --> 12:46.006
Look, why don't we
just forget about this,

12:46.144 --> 12:48.595
everybody have drink to
celebrate Weezy being safe.
Okay?

12:48.733 --> 12:49.803
What'll it be, Willis?

12:49.941 --> 12:52.323
Oh, I don't know.

12:52.461 --> 12:53.911
How about a White Mule?

12:54.843 --> 12:56.258
What's a White Mule?

12:56.396 --> 12:57.915
A honky donkey!

13:02.954 --> 13:04.853
Uh, no, thank you, George.

13:04.991 --> 13:07.925
I think the champagne
we had at your office
is affecting me.

13:08.063 --> 13:10.755
Look, Willis, you have to
learn to drink without
getting sick.

13:10.893 --> 13:13.585
Oh, I'm not sick. I said
it was affecting me.

13:13.723 --> 13:15.795
C'mon, Helen,
let's go upstairs.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.419
That's a good idea.

13:19.557 --> 13:21.524
The champagne's
affecting me, too.

13:21.662 --> 13:24.286
Good!
It's giving me a headache.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.951
Mr. Jefferson, perhaps it was
a disgruntled customer.

13:34.089 --> 13:36.505
Who?
The crank who's playing
this nasty joke on you.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.058
Oh, Bentley,
it's all over now.

13:38.196 --> 13:40.681
Weezy's home safe,
the case is closed.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.581
Uh.

13:45.997 --> 13:48.620
Hello? Yeah,
this is George Jefferson.

13:48.931 --> 13:49.898
What?

13:50.450 --> 13:52.176
You jive turkey.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.316
Yeah, I got the money.
It's the crank.

13:56.283 --> 13:57.802
Oh, so you got my wife, huh?

14:01.530 --> 14:04.015
Okay, let me talk to my wife.

14:04.153 --> 14:05.948
Your husband wants
to talk to you.

14:06.086 --> 14:08.226
Watch what you say
and make it quick.

14:19.962 --> 14:22.102
The kidnapers grabbed
Florence. They think
she's you.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.897
Florence? Are you sure?

14:24.035 --> 14:26.831
Look, Weezy. I'd know
that old cracked voice
any place.

14:26.969 --> 14:28.591
Florence, how'd you
get into this?

14:28.729 --> 14:30.248
Well, uh, darling,

14:30.386 --> 14:33.044
these two men
came to our apartment

14:33.182 --> 14:35.081
and told me not to
make a sound, and...

14:35.219 --> 14:38.153
Well, tell 'em they screwed
up and you ain't my wife.
Maybe they'll let you go.

14:38.291 --> 14:42.502
Wait a minute! Uh, George,
dear, you don't understand.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.091
These men know there ain't
nobody in this world

14:45.229 --> 14:48.818
more important to you
and worth more than your wife.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.130
Me!

14:51.028 --> 14:52.892
So, now, George, dear,

14:53.030 --> 14:55.791
you better do exactly
what these men tell you.

14:55.929 --> 14:59.381
After all, you do want to
see me again, don't you,
George darling?

15:04.075 --> 15:07.216
Now, look, Shorty, I don't
want no stuff outta you!

15:10.495 --> 15:13.153
Uh-uh, I mean, eh,
George, sweetie.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.086
What?

15:16.225 --> 15:17.192
Yea.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.884
Yes.

15:20.022 --> 15:23.612
Yes, dear, I know
$100,000 is a lot of money.

15:25.027 --> 15:27.685
But I heard on my car radio
that some man paid

15:27.823 --> 15:34.554
$5,552,197 for his wife.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.902
Hey, Pop what is she saying?

15:38.040 --> 15:41.147
I don't know, she's rambling
about some guy that paid
a bunch of dough for his wife.

15:41.457 --> 15:42.458
What?

15:42.596 --> 15:46.324
Yeah, I heard you.
$5,552,197.

15:46.462 --> 15:49.362
But what's that
got to do with...
Okay, time's up.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.778
Now, listen, chump,
and listen good.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.436
There's a tire store
on the corner of 95th
and Lexington.

15:54.574 --> 15:56.300
If you ever wanna see
your wife again,

15:56.438 --> 15:59.199
go to the alley behind
the store and put the money
in the garbage pail.

15:59.337 --> 16:02.858
Got it? I don't want any lip!
Just have the dough there
in half an hour.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.274
And remember, no cops!

16:05.412 --> 16:08.519
Yeah, okay, no cops. But...
The jive turkey hung up.

16:09.347 --> 16:10.900
How did Florence sound?
Terrible.

16:11.039 --> 16:13.455
Oh, that's awful.
No, that's normal.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.872
What'd they say, Pop?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.944
Well, they told me to drop
the money off behind the
tire store in half an hour.

16:20.082 --> 16:21.497
Well, you better get going.

16:21.635 --> 16:24.431
Not me, I'm calling the cops.
But they said not to.

16:24.569 --> 16:26.882
Yes, you didn't want to
call the police before.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.815
That's when I thought
they had Weezy.

16:28.953 --> 16:31.335
Oh, now, Pop,
what's the difference
between Mom and Florence?

16:31.473 --> 16:34.407
Look, if you don't know
the difference by now,
you gotta be pretty dumb.

16:35.235 --> 16:37.375
No! No, Mr. Jefferson,

16:37.513 --> 16:39.446
Florence's life is in danger!

16:39.584 --> 16:41.379
No, it ain't.

16:41.517 --> 16:43.519
In about two hours,
them kidnappers are
gonna be begging her

16:43.657 --> 16:45.590
to get out and
take her mouth with her.

16:45.728 --> 16:49.870
Hello, Mr. Jefferson, sir.
Ralph! Maybe you can help us.
You been here all day, right?

16:50.009 --> 16:51.907
Well, no. sir. I was
gone about an hour.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.220
What? You deserted
your post, huh?

16:54.358 --> 16:56.360
You could be shot
for that in the service!

16:56.498 --> 16:58.120
For going to Woolworth's?

16:58.258 --> 16:59.466
Woolworth's?

16:59.604 --> 17:02.331
Yes, sir. To get you
this office warming present.

17:02.469 --> 17:05.990
Oh... Yeah, well, you were
only gone an hour.

17:06.128 --> 17:08.096
Hey, Ralph that's pretty nice.

17:08.234 --> 17:13.204
Yes, sir. I figured a man
as busy as you would need
a good pocket calendar.

17:13.342 --> 17:15.172
Yeah, but Ralph,
this books been used.

17:15.310 --> 17:19.521
Oh, no, sir. I just noted
a few important dates you
wouldn't want to forget.

17:19.659 --> 17:21.661
Christmas, my birthday,

17:22.351 --> 17:23.732
Thanksgiving,

17:23.870 --> 17:25.044
April 16th...

17:25.182 --> 17:26.424
April 16th?

17:26.562 --> 17:28.909
The day after taxes, sir.
I'm a little short then.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
Uh. Hey, wait a minute,
Ralph. Look...

17:31.188 --> 17:33.293
Uh, did you see any
suspicious-looking strangers

17:33.431 --> 17:34.881
hanging around
the building today?

17:35.019 --> 17:36.193
No, sir.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.402
Think hard, Ralph.
Now, this is important.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.542
Did you see anybody
take that elevator
up to this floor?

17:42.199 --> 17:44.753
Well, only those two
telephone repairmen.

17:44.891 --> 17:47.618
They must be doin' very
well, sir. They gave me
a $20 tip.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.413
You idiot! That's them?

17:49.551 --> 17:52.726
What them?
Them them!
What'd they look like?

17:52.864 --> 17:55.660
I didn't notice.
I was too busy
looking at the $20 bill.

17:55.798 --> 17:57.421
But next time, sir,
I'll make sure...

17:57.559 --> 18:02.564
Damn Ralph! He's always
got his hands open and
his eyes closed!

18:02.702 --> 18:06.050
Five million dollars. I don't
recall anyone ever paying
that much ransom.

18:06.188 --> 18:08.156
Oh, Florence said she heard
it on her car radio.

18:08.294 --> 18:10.606
Oh, wait a minute,
that can't be.

18:10.744 --> 18:12.781
Florence doesn't
have a car radio.

18:12.919 --> 18:14.403
She doesn't even have a car!

18:14.541 --> 18:17.337
I'll bet she was
trying to give us a clue!
That's it!

18:17.475 --> 18:18.821
They've got her in a car!

18:18.959 --> 18:20.961
C'mon, let's go!
Come on, Bentley.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.246
Where am I going?
There's a million cars
in this city.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.524
George, you are wasting time.

18:31.662 --> 18:34.665
Now, pick up that money
and drop it where they
told you to.

18:34.803 --> 18:37.530
Yeah, you're right, Weezy.
We gotta get her back.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.601
But I'm taking this
out of her salary.

18:41.982 --> 18:44.295
Mr. Jefferson,
I think I've got it!

18:44.433 --> 18:46.608
I think I know
where Florence is!

18:46.746 --> 18:48.161
How could you know that?

18:48.299 --> 18:51.233
I figured it out thanks to
SenoraHidalgo.
Who?

18:51.371 --> 18:54.167
SenoraHidalgo was
a character in a mystery
story I once read.

18:54.305 --> 18:55.927
The Case of the
Kidnapped Contessa.

18:56.065 --> 18:58.378
It was written by...
What are your mumbling
about Bentley.

18:58.516 --> 19:00.449
Come to think of it,
I lent that book to Florence.

19:00.587 --> 19:03.694
That's the trouble with
Florence. She's always
reading instead of working!

19:03.832 --> 19:06.524
SenoraHidalgo and her husband
were living in exile
in England,

19:06.662 --> 19:08.526
when she was kidnapped
by hostile forces.

19:08.664 --> 19:10.632
But unbeknownst
to her kidnappers,

19:10.770 --> 19:14.429
both SenoraHidalgo and
her husband were amateur
radio operators,

19:14.567 --> 19:16.741
well versed in Morse Code.
So?

19:16.879 --> 19:18.502
So, in the presence
of her captors,

19:18.640 --> 19:21.574
SenoraHidalgo tapped out
her location in Morse Code

19:21.712 --> 19:23.955
while talking on
the telephone to her husband.

19:24.093 --> 19:26.061
As I recall, she used
her wedding ring.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.753
Dot, dot, dot,
dit, dit, dit...
Uh, Mr. Bentley,

19:28.891 --> 19:31.825
what's this got
to do with Florence?
She's not even married.

19:31.963 --> 19:36.278
Or was it dit, dit, dot,
dot, dot...

19:36.416 --> 19:39.454
I'm gonna dot your head if
you don't cut it out, Bentley.

19:39.592 --> 19:41.628
Yeah, Mr. Bentley,
just tell us where
is Florence.

19:41.766 --> 19:44.252
Well, I don't know exactly.
But you said...

19:44.390 --> 19:47.116
However, I think I know
how we can find her.
Look at this.

19:48.325 --> 19:50.879
You're
a genius, Mr. Bentley.

19:51.707 --> 19:55.332
Hey, you sure are, Bentley!
Haha!

19:59.336 --> 20:01.200
Operator, give me the police.

20:03.063 --> 20:06.481
I'll give it a couple a more
minutes and then I'll drive
down to make the pickup.

20:06.619 --> 20:10.139
Yeah, I can't wait to see
all that beautiful green.

20:10.278 --> 20:12.141
Excuse me,
is it all right if I...

20:12.280 --> 20:14.247
You just went
five minutes ago!

20:14.385 --> 20:17.216
I was just gonna ask
if it's all right if I pray.

20:17.354 --> 20:19.010
Sure. Go ahead.

20:19.148 --> 20:22.462
Just a closer walk with thee
Hold it down, lady.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.775
Grant it Jesus
if you please
Knock it down, lady.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.742
Knock off the noise!

20:32.921 --> 20:34.233
Noise?

20:34.371 --> 20:36.580
I was singing to the Lord,
like I do in church.

20:36.718 --> 20:39.203
Yeah? Well, this ain't
no church, so shut up!

20:39.341 --> 20:41.654
The Lord just ain't in
church, he's everywhere.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.483
Oh He is, is He?

20:43.621 --> 20:45.244
Well...

20:45.382 --> 20:47.384
Well, He ain't under there!

20:48.695 --> 20:50.559
Maybe He's hiding
in the closet!

20:51.353 --> 20:53.252
Nope.
No.

20:53.390 --> 20:56.703
I guess He took the
day off to play golf!
Golf.

20:56.841 --> 20:58.429
Stop that blaspheming!

20:58.567 --> 21:00.431
You keep talking
with the devil's tongue

21:00.569 --> 21:02.537
and the Lord's gonna
punish you!

21:02.675 --> 21:05.747
Now, if you was smart,
you'd get down on your
knees and repent!

21:05.885 --> 21:08.094
If you're smart,
you'll sit down
and shut up.

21:08.232 --> 21:10.717
You're gonna be talkin' to
the Lord face-to-face!

21:18.242 --> 21:19.830
Shouldn't you get started now?

21:19.968 --> 21:23.109
Yeah. But first, I better
call the airport to see
if our flight's on time.

21:23.247 --> 21:25.249
You think were askin'
enough money for her?

21:25.387 --> 21:27.113
A hundred grand
ain't pocket change.

21:27.251 --> 21:30.806
Yeah, but some guy paid over
five million for his wife.
Ain't that right?

21:31.151 --> 21:32.152
Huh?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.257
Oh, oh, yeah.

21:33.395 --> 21:34.741
Gimme Global Airlines.

21:34.879 --> 21:36.087
Who paid all that money?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.504
I... I don't remember.

21:38.642 --> 21:40.471
How much did you
say he paid?
Uh, uh, uh... A lot.

21:40.609 --> 21:43.923
You said it was five million,
five hundred thousand
something.

21:44.061 --> 21:46.374
Something like that.

21:49.756 --> 21:55.624
It was $5,552,197, wasn't it?

21:55.762 --> 21:57.177
I can't remember figures.

21:58.455 --> 21:59.973
Damn!
What's the matter?
The lines busy?

22:00.111 --> 22:02.079
No! She told him where we are!

22:02.217 --> 22:05.116
What?
See? 555-2197!

22:05.254 --> 22:08.706
That's our phone number!
They could be tracing us
right now!

22:08.844 --> 22:10.501
You're gonna pay
for this, lady!
Wait a minute!

22:10.639 --> 22:11.675
You ain't got
nothing to worry about!

22:11.813 --> 22:13.504
My boss is too dumb
to pick up that clue!

22:15.955 --> 22:17.577
What'd you say?

22:17.715 --> 22:20.304
I said my boss... Uh, I
mean, Mr. Jeff... I mean,
my husband is too dumb!

22:22.237 --> 22:23.894
Something ain't right here.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.933
No.
Yeah. Didn't you hear her?

22:29.071 --> 22:31.004
First, she said her boss.
Then she said Mr. Jeff...

22:31.142 --> 22:33.006
Ah, shut up, you nit.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.734
Okay, lady, just who are you?

22:36.872 --> 22:39.012
I'm George Jefferson's wife!
What's your first name?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.497
Florence! Uh...uh...
I mean Louise!

22:40.635 --> 22:41.808
Check her wallet!

22:41.946 --> 22:44.086
If you're lying to us, lady...

22:44.224 --> 22:47.055
It says here
she's Florence Johnston.
Florence Johnston?

22:47.193 --> 22:49.126
That's my stage name!
Your stage name?

22:50.092 --> 22:51.853
Yeah, I'm a dancer. See?

22:57.548 --> 22:59.964
I bet you don't make
too much money dancing,

23:00.102 --> 23:03.554
'cause your insurance card
says you're a housekeeper.
A housekeeper!

23:03.692 --> 23:05.245
Damn, we got the maid!

23:06.350 --> 23:08.421
The maid? We ain't gonna
get a dime for her!

23:08.559 --> 23:10.630
Oh, yes you will!
Mr. Jefferson just loves me!

23:10.768 --> 23:13.046
He's always saying,
"Florence, ain't nobody
in the world like you!"

23:13.184 --> 23:15.324
We gotta get outta here!
Wait! What are we gonna do
with her?

23:15.463 --> 23:16.636
We'll have to get rid of her.
Why?

23:16.774 --> 23:18.569
Yeah, why?
'Cause you can identify us.

23:18.707 --> 23:20.985
No, I can't! All you people
look alike to me!

23:28.441 --> 23:31.410
What are you worried about?
They'll never find us
down in Florida.

23:31.548 --> 23:34.171
You jerk! Now we gotta
take care of her.

23:34.309 --> 23:35.793
You just told her
where we're going!

23:35.931 --> 23:37.554
I didn't hear him.
I wasn't listening!

23:39.935 --> 23:41.523
But we don't wanna
risk a murder rap.

23:41.661 --> 23:44.353
Did you say murder?
I thought you
weren't listening?

23:44.492 --> 23:46.321
I wasn't! That was just
a lucky guess.

23:47.598 --> 23:49.255
We'll dump her along the way.

23:49.393 --> 23:51.844
Dump her? Oh, Lord...

23:51.982 --> 23:53.984
Tie her up and gag her!

23:54.122 --> 23:57.401
Save me, Jesus!
Deliver me from this evil!

23:57.539 --> 23:59.472
I'm thanking You
in advance, Lord.

23:59.610 --> 24:01.405
This is
your daughter. Florence.

24:02.233 --> 24:05.305
Hurry up!
It's all twisted.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.555
Gag her first!
Then the ropes!

24:13.693 --> 24:16.558
Oh, Lord, um,
save these poor sinners!

24:16.696 --> 24:18.767
Will you just shut up?
I'm praying for you!

24:18.905 --> 24:20.459
You're asking for it!

24:20.597 --> 24:23.220
Oh, St. Peter, open up
your pearly gates

24:23.841 --> 24:25.325
'cause here I come.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.810
Police. Freeze!

24:27.983 --> 24:29.019
Drop it.

24:29.157 --> 24:30.883
Oh, Lord, take me into
your house...

24:35.922 --> 24:38.477
It's okay now, Miss.

24:40.133 --> 24:43.102
It's okay, Miss!
As you know,
I've been good, Lord.

24:46.105 --> 24:48.763
I said it's okay,
you're safe.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.212
Oh...

24:50.350 --> 24:52.560
Oh. Thank you, Jesus.

24:53.802 --> 24:55.563
I knew You'd save me.

24:56.218 --> 24:58.186
But what took you so long?

25:05.331 --> 25:08.714
So then I threw on
my coat and went out
the door.

25:08.852 --> 25:13.270
And child, there they was,
waiting for me.

25:13.408 --> 25:16.998
Something told me right away
that they meant business.
What was that, Florence?

25:17.136 --> 25:19.172
That gun sticking in my face!

25:22.451 --> 25:25.109
Here you are, Florence.
This will help calm you down.

25:25.247 --> 25:29.320
Hooo, I tell ya, I ain't never
been treated so bad before
in my life.

25:29.458 --> 25:32.047
They animals!
Nothing but animals.

25:32.185 --> 25:34.118
But you said
they didn't hurt you.

25:34.256 --> 25:35.810
Look what they did to my hat!

25:37.397 --> 25:41.574
It's just your hat.
Just think of what they
coulda done to your head.

25:41.712 --> 25:43.300
You're right about that,
Mrs. Jefferson.

25:43.438 --> 25:45.371
Child, I can't tell ya all
how worried I was.

25:45.509 --> 25:49.064
What you worried about?
You shoulda known I'd pick up
that clue just like that.

25:49.202 --> 25:53.103
George, you didn't...
But it's been a good
day after all.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.348
I got my wife,
I got my money...
And you got me.

25:57.486 --> 25:59.799
Don't spoil it.

26:01.698 --> 26:03.872
I got my son going into
business with me. Right?

26:04.010 --> 26:05.494
Wrong.
But, Lionel you said...

26:05.633 --> 26:07.496
We, Pop, said
we'd think about it.

26:07.635 --> 26:10.776
And we did. But Lionel's
not gonna take the job.

26:10.914 --> 26:13.330
But, think of all that
money, and what you
can do with it, Lionel.

26:13.468 --> 26:15.884
Oh, I did, Pop.
But you know something?

26:16.022 --> 26:20.026
I saw what all that money
almost did to Mom and
Florence.

26:20.164 --> 26:24.237
I think Lionel is right,
George. One tycoon in
the family is enough.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.861
Yeah, I guess you're right.
For now.

26:27.965 --> 26:29.277
Hey...

26:31.003 --> 26:32.418
Where's the money?

26:32.556 --> 26:34.351
What money?
The ransom money!

26:34.489 --> 26:37.285
Oh, the last time I saw it,
it was right there.
Well, it ain't there now!

26:37.423 --> 26:38.424
Get up.

26:39.736 --> 26:41.185
Don't nobody leave!

26:43.015 --> 26:45.051
All right, come on,
come on, come on,
help me find that money!

26:45.189 --> 26:46.190
C'mon, Weez.

27:01.689 --> 27:03.345
Mama, what are you doing
with the money?

27:03.483 --> 27:06.314
I'm counting it.
You made me lose my place.

27:07.418 --> 27:08.419
Guys!

27:09.973 --> 27:12.665
That ain't necessary, Mama.
The man said it was all there.

27:14.115 --> 27:17.843
George, were you really going
to pay all that money for me?

27:17.981 --> 27:20.259
Sure, Weezy. You know you're
worth your weight in gold.

27:20.397 --> 27:21.467
Aww...

27:23.607 --> 27:27.646
I don't think there's
that much gold in Fort Knox.

27:52.981 --> 27:56.916
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
