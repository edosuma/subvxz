<i>Hello.</i>

<i>Was I snoring like a truck driver?</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:55.305

01:04.105 --> 01:05.774
<i>Cold? No, why?</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:07.067
<i>Odd,</i>

<i>-Hmm.</i>

<i>Right, 'cause I said that I wouldn't</i>

<i>Yes, yes, you think you're very funny.</i>

01:16.951 --> 01:19.621
<i>Oh, I know I'm very funny. [chuckles]</i>

01:19.704 --> 01:22.749
<i>I also know that you are ticklish.</i>

<i>Eggs or pancakes?</i>

<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-An old fashioned?</i>

<i>[chuckles] Oh, come on.</i>

01:45.021 --> 01:46.689

<i>Yes!</i>

<i>-Oh.</i>

<i>My boobs.</i>

02:44.956 --> 02:47.292
<i>I'm pumping. Wearable breast pumps.</i>

02:47.375 --> 02:49.294
<i>Best invention since the epidural.</i>

02:50.420 --> 02:51.296
<i>Hmm.</i>

02:52.380 --> 02:53.798
<i>The detective has mojo.</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:55.967
<i>She-- What?</i>

02:56.050 --> 02:57.927
<i>We had sex, and then this morning--</i>

02:58.011 --> 02:58.887
<i>Wow. Wait...</i>

02:59.429 --> 03:00.763
<i>You guys had sex?</i>

03:01.264 --> 03:02.515
<i>Finally!</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
<i>This is wonderful!</i>

03:04.350 --> 03:07.645
<i>Well, it was wonderful, yes.</i>
<i>Of course it was, but like I was saying,</i>

03:07.729 --> 03:10.273
<i>tiny hiccup, she can now do what I do.</i>

03:10.648 --> 03:11.858
<i>Expose people's desires.</i>

03:11.941 --> 03:12.984
<i>Well, how did that happen?</i>

03:13.067 --> 03:16.029
<i>I don't know, Doctor. </i>
<i>Why do you think I've come to see you?</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:17.697
<i>All I know is,</i>

03:17.780 --> 03:20.158
<i>she didn't have mojo, then we had sex,</i>
<i>and now she does.</i>

03:20.241 --> 03:22.118
<i>How did you even find out</i>
<i>that she could do that?</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:23.745
<i>Well, only by accident.</i>

03:23.828 --> 03:27.332
<i>She's seen me do it quite a bit, so</i>
<i>she did it as a joke, and it happened to--</i>

03:29.334 --> 03:30.501
<i>Hold on.</i>

03:30.752 --> 03:32.003
<i>Do you think it's possible</i>

03:32.086 --> 03:36.007
<i>I've given my power to everyone I've ever</i>
<i>had sex with and just never knew it?</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:39.469
<i>Uh... Who, me?</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:40.803
<i>No.</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:44.432
<i>Well, we did the deed, several times,</i>
<i>and in, you know, all sorts of positions.</i>

03:44.515 --> 03:45.934
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

03:46.517 --> 03:47.518
<i>How could I forget?</i>

03:47.810 --> 03:48.978
<i>Anyway... But, Lucifer,</i>

03:49.354 --> 03:51.231
<i>your mojo is like a superpower.</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:52.273
<i>I don't have it.</i>

03:52.357 --> 03:53.566
<i>[mechanical pumping]</i>

03:53.691 --> 03:54.525
<i>Or do I?</i>

03:55.818 --> 03:58.029
<i>-I guess I've never tried.</i>
<i>-Well, let's try now. Come on.</i>

03:58.112 --> 03:59.739
<i>Lean in. Look into my eyes.</i>

03:59.822 --> 04:00.907
<i>Ask me what I desire.</i>

04:01.366 --> 04:03.326
<i>[squeals] This is good. I mean...</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:05.036
<i>Lucifer...</i>

04:05.536 --> 04:08.915
<i>what do you desire?</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:13.044
<i>No.</i> <i>Nada. Totally limp.</i>

04:13.127 --> 04:14.212
<i>Oof. Ouch.</i>

04:14.295 --> 04:16.506
<i>Well, that's several million</i>
<i>bullets dodged.</i>

04:17.298 --> 04:19.300
<i>So it's just the detective</i>
<i>who's the problem.</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:21.844
<i>-Why does it have to be a problem?</i>
<i>-Because...</i>

04:22.136 --> 04:23.972
<i>desire is my thing.</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:26.849
<i>My mojo is the reason</i>
<i>I'm useful to her in the first place.</i>

04:26.933 --> 04:29.686
<i>If she can do it, too,</i>
<i>what's my role in the partnership?</i>

04:29.769 --> 04:31.271
<i>Who even am I?</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:34.399
<i>Okay, so you don't think that you can</i>
<i>share this with her and still be you?</i>

04:34.816 --> 04:37.443
<i>Lucifer, that's what</i>
<i>being in a relationship is,</i>

04:37.527 --> 04:40.071
<i>sharing without losing yourself</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

04:40.613 --> 04:41.948
<i>-Uh...?</i>
<i>-Besides,</i>

04:42.031 --> 04:47.328
<i>the fact that Chloe can now mojo people,</i>
<i>too, doesn't mean that you have to stop.</i>

04:48.621 --> 04:49.455
<i>You're right.</i>

04:49.956 --> 04:51.249
<i>[chuckles] You're right.</i>

04:51.332 --> 04:54.502
<i>I am, and always will be,</i>
<i>master of the mojo.</i>

04:54.585 --> 04:55.753
<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-King of desire.</i>

04:55.837 --> 04:56.671
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:56.754 --> 04:58.381
<i>Sultan of humans' innermost wishes.</i>

04:58.464 --> 04:59.882
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Yeah...</i>

04:59.966 --> 05:01.509
<i>"What is it you desire?"</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:03.344
<i>"Excuse me, what is it you desire?"</i>

05:03.428 --> 05:04.345
<i>[mechanical pumping]</i>

<i>-Decker!</i>
<i>-Hey.</i>

05:11.519 --> 05:15.398
<i>So, did you and Lucifer finally get over</i>
<i>your issues and under the covers</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:17.233
<i>for the old no-pants dance?</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:18.651
<i>We sure did.</i>

05:18.735 --> 05:21.321
<i>Well, I'm so sorry, Decker.</i>
<i>You know, sometimes...</i>

05:22.447 --> 05:23.990
<i>Wait, I'm sorry.</i>

05:24.073 --> 05:24.949
<i>Rewind.</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:26.659
<i>Did you just say yes?</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:28.036
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

05:29.203 --> 05:30.079
<i>OMG!</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.164
<i>Oh! [spluttering]</i>

05:31.247 --> 05:33.791
<i>I was so ready to have</i>
<i>my Deckerstar dreams crushed again.</i>

05:33.875 --> 05:36.210
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-'Cause it's been one bummer after another</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.338
<i>with you two.</i>
<i>I didn't want to get my hopes up.</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:39.756
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

05:39.839 --> 05:43.760
<i>I mean, it has been a long road,</i>
<i>but, well, here we are.</i>

05:43.843 --> 05:45.053
<i>Cool beans.</i>

05:45.261 --> 05:48.389
<i>Wait, why do I get the feeling that</i>
<i>you're not just asking to ask? What's up?</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:50.141
<i>Busted. Okay.</i>

05:50.224 --> 05:52.518
<i>I couldn't wait to tell you</i>
<i>about </i>my <i>thing.</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:54.437
<i>-Oh, you have a thing?</i>
<i>-I might have a thing.</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:58.441
<i>So, remember that reporter</i>
<i>who seemed way too nice to be my type?</i>

05:58.524 --> 05:59.776
<i>Yeah, so, um, you know,</i>

05:59.859 --> 06:02.111
<i>I-I decided to give it a shot,</i>

06:02.195 --> 06:04.364
<i>-and we met up last night...</i>
<i>-Ooh!</i>

06:04.447 --> 06:05.573
<i>...and let me tell you,</i>

06:05.656 --> 06:08.618
<i>-he is not always too nice.</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

06:08.701 --> 06:11.120
<i>Morning, Miss Lopez. Morning, Detective.</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:12.705
<i>Good morning again, Lucifer.</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:13.748
<i>[Lucifer chuckles]</i>

06:15.750 --> 06:18.795
<i>Uh, sorry for the delay.</i>
<i>I had to make a pit stop at Linda's.</i>

06:19.295 --> 06:20.505
<i>So, what have we got?</i>

06:20.588 --> 06:24.467
<i>Any witnesses or suspects on whom</i>
<i>my uncanny interview skills are required,</i>

06:24.550 --> 06:25.885
<i>if you know what I mean?</i>

06:25.968 --> 06:29.097
<i>Uh, I actually have no information</i>
<i>on the victim yet.</i>

06:29.180 --> 06:30.807
<i>Ella, is, um... Is...</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:34.227
<i>-Ella, is Dan here yet?</i>
<i>-Ah!</i>

06:34.310 --> 06:36.896
<i>Oh, El Espinoza called in sick, </i>
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

06:36.979 --> 06:39.524
<i>Ugh, did he look in the mirror again?</i>
<i>I told him not to do that.</i>

06:39.941 --> 06:41.317
<i>[Lucifer chuckles]</i>

06:43.861 --> 06:44.862
<i>We should...</i>

06:44.946 --> 06:45.780
<i>Right.</i>

06:48.866 --> 06:50.076
<i>[camera clicks]</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:54.831
<i>[Ella] Diane Luna, famous soprano.</i>

06:54.914 --> 06:56.499
<i>Time of death, 10:00 p.m. last night.</i>

06:57.125 --> 06:58.668
<i>Check out this puncture mark.</i>

06:58.751 --> 07:02.088
<i>My guess, toxicology reports will confirm</i>
<i>that she was injected</i>

07:02.171 --> 07:03.714
<i>with some sort of paralytic agent.</i>

07:03.798 --> 07:05.383
<i>-Is that how she died?</i>
<i>-Worse.</i>

07:05.466 --> 07:06.634
<i>Much worse.</i>

07:06.717 --> 07:08.928
<i>You see this blood stain pattern</i>
<i>on these lilies?</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:12.723
<i>That's from Diane coughing</i>
<i>as she was choking on her own blood.</i>

07:12.807 --> 07:15.309
<i>The killer inserted a knife</i>
<i>into her throat,</i>

07:15.393 --> 07:18.354
<i>made two very precise cuts,</i>
<i>slashing her vocal cords.</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:20.940
<i>Sounds like someone went</i>
<i>to a lot of trouble to make a point.</i>

07:21.023 --> 07:24.110
<i>Yes, I smell an annoyed neighbor</i>
<i>who's tired of her singing.</i>

07:24.193 --> 07:26.070
<i>Shall I go mojo them all?</i>
<i>I should, shouldn't I?</i>

07:26.154 --> 07:30.158
<i>Well, there's no sign of forced entry,</i>
<i>so most likely Diane knew her assailant.</i>

07:30.241 --> 07:33.411
<i>[sighs] Well, a jilted lover, then,</i>
<i>based on the flowers.</i>

07:33.494 --> 07:36.038
<i>Except she was a famous opera star.</i>
<i>I mean, look.</i>

07:36.122 --> 07:37.748
<i>They have flowers all the time.</i>

07:38.249 --> 07:39.750
<i>Ella, who found the body?</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:41.752
<i>Oh, uh, Norman, Diane's neighbor.</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:42.962
<i>-Over there.</i>
<i>-[Lucifer] Ah!</i>

07:43.045 --> 07:45.715
<i>Right the first time.</i>
<i>Annoyed neighbor, it is.</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:49.594
<i>Yeah, apparently he found the door ajar,</i>
<i>came across the body, and phoned it in.</i>

07:49.677 --> 07:50.678
<i>That's what he says.</i>

07:50.761 --> 07:51.721
<i>This way, Detective.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:54.515
<i>I suspect we're about to hear </i>
<i>this suspect's confession.</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:00.271
<i>-Excuse me.</i>
<i>-I wasn't.</i>

08:00.354 --> 08:02.690
<i>Hi. Detective Decker.</i>
<i>Can we ask you a few questions?</i>

08:02.773 --> 08:03.774
<i>Sure.</i>

08:03.858 --> 08:07.612
<i>It must have been pretty irritating</i>
<i>living right next door to a soprano, hmm?</i>

08:07.695 --> 08:09.947
<i>You wanted to silence her</i>
<i>once and for all, didn't you?</i>

08:10.573 --> 08:12.992
<i>Learn from the master. Tell me, Norman...</i>

08:13.701 --> 08:14.619
<i>Normsky...</i>

08:14.702 --> 08:17.038
<i>-[mystical ringing]</i>
<i>-...what is it you desire?</i>

08:18.581 --> 08:19.957
<i>[mystical ringing fades]</i>

08:20.416 --> 08:21.250
<i>What?</i>

08:22.084 --> 08:24.212
<i>That's a weird thing to ask, man.</i>

08:24.879 --> 08:25.838
<i>Not working.</i>

08:26.380 --> 08:27.256
<i>But...</i>

08:28.090 --> 08:29.050
<i>that means...</i>

08:30.927 --> 08:33.179
<i>Detective, I think you stole my mojo.</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:43.356
<i>Never mind.</i>

08:43.564 --> 08:46.859
<i>Hello, Wyrzbeski.</i>

08:46.984 --> 08:48.945
<i>Tell me, apart from</i>
<i>a more pronounceable name,</i>

08:49.028 --> 08:50.154
<i>what do you desire?</i>

08:51.072 --> 08:52.323
<i>Is this about Secret Santa?</i>

08:52.406 --> 08:54.617
<i>'Cause you're not supposed to ask people</i>
<i>what they want.</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:55.743
<i>That, uh...</i>

08:55.868 --> 08:56.869
<i>That gives it away.</i>

08:57.495 --> 08:58.454
<i>Jeez.</i>

08:58.538 --> 08:59.580
<i>"Santa"?</i>

09:01.374 --> 09:02.708
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

09:03.626 --> 09:04.961
<i>I couldn't have done this.</i>

09:05.044 --> 09:07.338
<i>-I spent the whole night in Northrend.</i>
<i>-Where?</i>

09:07.421 --> 09:09.799
<i>-Excuse me, Officer, what do you desire?</i>
<i>-Northrend.</i>

09:09.882 --> 09:10.925
<i>In Azeroth?</i>

09:11.008 --> 09:13.427
<i>Ah, yes, we're... </i>
<i>We're talking video games?</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:14.804
<i>I led my guild on</i>

09:14.887 --> 09:17.431
<i>-a 17-hour campaign last night.</i>
<i>-[Lucifer] Excuse me, Officer.</i>

09:17.515 --> 09:19.392
<i>So you were home and awake all night?</i>

09:19.767 --> 09:21.143
<i>-Did you hear anything?</i>
<i>-Did I?</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:25.064
<i>First, the awful vocal exercises,</i>
<i>like every damn night,</i>

09:25.147 --> 09:27.984
<i>but then, as an annoying bonus,</i>
<i>two hours of arguing.</i>

09:28.067 --> 09:29.735
<i>-What were they arguing about?</i>
<i>-Excuse me!</i>

09:29.819 --> 09:32.572
<i>And did you get any details at all,</i>
<i>names, anything?</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:33.489
<i>No.</i>

09:33.573 --> 09:35.616
<i>Once I realized the noise wasn't stopping,</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:38.744
<i>I cranked up my headset</i>
<i>so I could hear my raiding party.</i>

09:38.828 --> 09:43.082
<i>It's getting so a guy can't plunder</i>
<i>a Lich King's barrow in peace anymore.</i>

09:43.165 --> 09:45.001
<i>Mm. Tough times.</i>

09:45.334 --> 09:48.796
<i>Yes, so we're going to need</i>
<i>your game log to confirm your alibi.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:50.047
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

09:50.131 --> 09:51.257
<i>[police radio chatter]</i>

09:51.340 --> 09:52.883
<i>Excuse me. [clears throat]</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:55.261
<i>Lucifer, what are you doing?</i>

09:55.344 --> 09:57.013
<i>Literally nothing. I'm powerless.</i>

09:57.096 --> 09:59.974
<i>Did you really lose your mojo?</i>
<i>How is that possible?</i>

10:00.057 --> 10:01.934
<i>When we had sex, it passed from me to you.</i>

10:02.018 --> 10:03.561
<i>That's ridiculous. I...</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:06.355
<i>We were only playing around this morning.</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:08.399
<i>I don't have your mojo.</i>

10:08.482 --> 10:09.942
<i>There's only one way to be sure.</i>

10:10.943 --> 10:12.612
<i>Right now? No!</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:14.655
<i>I'm not gonna mojo you here.</i>

10:14.739 --> 10:16.449
<i>-It's not gonna work anyhow.</i>
<i>-Please try.</i>

10:16.532 --> 10:17.491
<i>Try.</i>

10:17.908 --> 10:18.743
<i>Fine.</i>

10:24.749 --> 10:25.833
<i>What do you desire?</i>

10:27.960 --> 10:31.255
<i>I... want my mojo back.</i>

10:31.339 --> 10:32.381
<i>[Chloe gasps]</i>

10:34.467 --> 10:35.885
<i>Ha! [clears throat]</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:37.970
<i>Oh, my God. </i>

<i>[spluttering]</i>

<i>I...</i>

<i>It's real. It's...</i>

10:42.016 --> 10:42.933
<i>[chuckles]</i>

10:43.017 --> 10:45.311
<i>-...cool.</i>
<i>-No, not cool.</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:48.147
<i>Lucifer, we just got together.</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:50.733
<i>You're already finding things</i>
<i>to freak out about.</i>

10:50.816 --> 10:53.486
<i>I'm not finding anything, Detective.</i>
<i>All I've done is lose stuff.</i>

10:53.569 --> 10:56.989
<i>Do you realize how long</i>
<i>it took for us to get here?</i>

10:57.615 --> 10:59.575
<i>We finally have something good going on.</i>

10:59.659 --> 11:03.162
<i>I mean, can we please</i>
<i>just enjoy it for a minute?</i>

11:05.081 --> 11:06.832
<i>[chuckles lightly]</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:08.209
<i>Of course.</i>

11:09.335 --> 11:10.419
<i>Of course.</i>

11:16.258 --> 11:18.260
<i>[monotonous humming]</i>

11:23.724 --> 11:24.975
<i>That cannot be right.</i>

<i>[Amenadiel groans]</i>

11:30.314 --> 11:31.232
<i>[toy squeaks]</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:34.860
<i>Linda said that you were out with Dan,</i>

11:35.069 --> 11:36.237
<i>dodging baseball bats.</i>

11:36.320 --> 11:39.240
<i>Mm, we were supposed to go</i>
<i>to the Dodger baseball game.</i>

11:39.323 --> 11:41.033
<i>Oh. That's much more lame.</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:43.369
<i>No, what's lame is</i>
<i>Dan ditched me last minute. </i>

11:44.537 --> 11:45.413
<i>So I just...</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.207
<i>I just came back here</i>
<i>to get some work done.</i>

11:48.290 --> 11:51.377
<i>"Work"? Building more stuff for Charlie?</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:52.837
<i>How much does that kid need?</i>

11:53.796 --> 11:55.756
<i>I had two rocks when I was growing up.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:57.216
<i>One sharp, one not.</i>

11:57.717 --> 12:00.970
<i>Take the sharp one and try to stab things.</i>
<i>Take the dull one, try to make it sharp.</i>

12:01.053 --> 12:02.263
<i>That, um...</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:03.848
<i>That explains a lot.</i>

12:03.931 --> 12:06.517
<i>It explains why I'm not a spoiled brat,</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:08.811
<i>which is exactly what Charlie's</i>
<i>going to become</i>

12:08.894 --> 12:10.938
<i>if you keep buying him more toys.</i>

12:11.021 --> 12:13.566
<i>This is not a toy, Maze.</i>

12:13.649 --> 12:17.653
<i>This is a stimulating,</i>
<i>educational recreation-scape</i>

12:17.737 --> 12:18.696
<i>that if you...</i>

12:19.739 --> 12:21.741
<i>[groans, chuckles]</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:24.034
<i>You know, the truth is</i>
<i>when Dan didn't show up,</i>

12:24.118 --> 12:26.746
<i>coming back here was</i>
<i>the only thing that occurred to me.</i>

12:28.581 --> 12:30.666
<i>[sighs] How pathetic is that?</i>

12:30.750 --> 12:31.667
<i>Mm.</i>

12:32.585 --> 12:37.006
<i>I can't even remember how I spent my time</i>
<i>before I had Charlie.</i>

12:49.727 --> 12:53.606
<i>Okay, well, according to Diane's calendar,</i>
<i>at the time her neighbor heard the fight,</i>

12:53.689 --> 12:56.942
<i>our victim was meeting with someone</i>
<i>named Mario Canales.</i>

12:57.443 --> 12:59.570
<i>Well, if it was a standing</i>
<i>weekly appointment,</i>

12:59.653 --> 13:01.906
<i>I'm sure Diane knew Mario Canales well.</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:03.365
<i>Let me see what's online.</i>

13:06.410 --> 13:08.412
<i>Okay, so he's got a website,</i>

13:08.496 --> 13:10.998
<i>and it looks like he's a vocal coach.</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:14.794
<i>Oh! Well, if the appointment was</i>
<i>a weekly coaching session,</i>

13:14.877 --> 13:17.463
<i>that would explain the noises</i>
<i>that Norman was complaining about.</i>

13:17.546 --> 13:19.340
<i>Yeah. What about the argument?</i>

13:19.673 --> 13:21.383
<i>Oh, okay. I...</i>

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
<i>Ay-ay-ay!</i>

13:22.635 --> 13:25.471
<i>Check out Diane and Mario's text chain.</i>

13:25.554 --> 13:26.472
<i>Correction,</i>

13:26.555 --> 13:28.474
<i>-</i>sext <i>chain.</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

13:28.557 --> 13:32.353
<i>Nothing wrong with inserting</i>
<i>a little creativity into throat exercises.</i>

13:32.436 --> 13:34.563
<i>[Ella] </i>
<i>That is some strong emoji game there.</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:37.566
<i>Although, it's really making me crave</i>
<i>my mom's eggplant tacos.</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:39.944
<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-Wait, so they were having an affair?</i>

13:40.361 --> 13:42.696
<i>It says here that he's married with kids.</i>

13:42.780 --> 13:45.783
<i>Well, maybe the vocal coach was worried</i>
<i>that Diane would sing to his wife,</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:47.493
<i>so he cut her off before she could.</i>

13:47.743 --> 13:49.578
<i>Right. Right, let's go talk to Mario.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:50.663
<i>-Ow!</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

13:50.746 --> 13:51.747
<i>[Ella] Oh!</i>

13:51.831 --> 13:52.706
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

13:52.790 --> 13:55.543
<i>-Pete, are you okay?</i>
<i>-Ow! What's wrong with that door?</i>

13:55.626 --> 13:58.170
<i>-Oh, uh, sorry.</i>
<i>-Hey, um... Hi.</i>

13:58.712 --> 14:01.298
<i>Sorry. I didn't mean</i>
<i>to interrupt you at work.</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:06.345
<i>But I scored these two VIP tickets</i>
<i>to the</i> Star Trek<i> convention downtown.</i>

14:06.428 --> 14:09.723
<i>I-I have no idea if you're into it,</i>
<i>but it's totally my thing,</i>

14:09.807 --> 14:12.142
<i>and I was wondering</i>
<i>if you wanted to come with me.</i>

14:12.226 --> 14:13.227
<i>Star Trek?</i>

14:13.310 --> 14:16.647
<i>Please, Miss Lopez knows more</i>
<i>about that stuff than you ever could.</i>

14:17.940 --> 14:20.317
<i>[speaking Klingon]</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:22.111
<i>See? She even speaks Chewbacca.</i>

<i>[speaking Klingon]</i>

<i>[both speaking Klingon]</i>

<i>But-- But </i>Star Trek<i> is your thing.</i>

<i>Well, I mean,</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:39.962
<i>Lucifer, the 24th century</i>
<i>is big enough for the both of us.</i>

14:40.796 --> 14:41.630
<i>[Chloe] See?</i>

14:42.256 --> 14:43.465
<i>Sharing's not that hard.</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:46.010
<i>[Ella and Pete speak indistinctly]</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:48.721
<i>Excuse me.</i>

14:48.804 --> 14:51.265
<i>I'm Detective Decker.</i>
<i>We're looking for a Mario Canales.</i>

14:51.348 --> 14:52.808
<i>Uh, he's kind of busy right now.</i>

14:53.851 --> 14:55.185
<i>[Chloe] Not so busy anymore.</i>

14:59.648 --> 15:01.525
<i>Bravo, Mr. Canales.</i>

15:01.775 --> 15:04.570
<i>A-list vocal coach by day,</i>
<i>Z-list jingle singer by night.</i>

15:04.653 --> 15:05.613
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

15:05.696 --> 15:08.407
<i>Look, it's happening already.</i>
<i>Our mojo's working on him.</i>

15:08.490 --> 15:10.284
<i>Aw, you called it "our" mojo.</i>

15:10.409 --> 15:11.702
<i>[chuckles] Now, go on.</i>

15:11.785 --> 15:13.287
<i>Go in for the coup de grâce.</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:15.664
<i>You've got this.</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:18.959
<i>Mr. Canales, I'm Detective Decker,</i>

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
<i>and I need to ask you a few questions.</i>

15:23.547 --> 15:25.132
<i>What do you desire?</i>

15:27.718 --> 15:29.803
<i>To tell you anything you want to know.</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:31.138
<i>Very good.</i>

15:31.221 --> 15:34.141
<i>What </i>we <i>want to know is,</i>
<i>why did you kill Diane Luna?</i>

15:34.934 --> 15:36.977
<i>W-Wait, Diane is dead?</i>

15:37.061 --> 15:39.939
<i>The performance is over, Mario.</i>
<i>We've seen your eggplant.</i>

15:40.022 --> 15:41.815
<i>We know you were having an affair</i>
<i>with Diane.</i>

15:41.899 --> 15:43.275
<i>Did she threaten to tell your wife?</i>

15:43.359 --> 15:45.027
<i>What? No.</i>

15:45.110 --> 15:47.529
<i>My-- My marriage has been over</i>
<i>for almost a year.</i>

15:47.613 --> 15:50.491
<i>Well, the happy family photos</i>
<i>on your website suggest otherwise.</i>

15:50.574 --> 15:53.619
<i>[sighs] Look, I only keep those up</i>
<i>for appearances' sake.</i>

15:53.702 --> 15:55.329
<i>Then why'd you fight</i>
<i>the night of her murder?</i>

15:55.412 --> 15:56.789
<i>Well, isn't it obvious?</i>

15:56.872 --> 15:59.833
<i>Mr. Canales taught Diane all his tricks,</i>
<i>and then she rose above him.</i>

15:59.917 --> 16:02.544
<i>The pupil leaving the master.</i>
<i>I mean, who'd enjoy that?</i>

16:02.628 --> 16:03.712
<i>I did.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:05.381
<i>I was so proud of Diane.</i>

16:05.881 --> 16:08.133
<i>And besides, she was my best calling card.</i>

16:08.217 --> 16:11.136
<i>That's why we fought.</i>
<i>I didn't want her to throw it all away.</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.513
<i>Why would she throw it all away?</i>

16:13.347 --> 16:16.892
<i>She-- She was about to go public with some</i>
<i>major accusations against an opera star.</i>

16:17.351 --> 16:18.644
<i>I tried to talk her out of it.</i>

16:18.727 --> 16:20.479
<i>An opera star? Who?</i>

16:22.648 --> 16:24.066
<i>You didn't hear this from me...</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:29.905
<i>but Niels Schuman is a tyrant and a bully.</i>

16:29.989 --> 16:31.782
<i>Niels Schuman, the world-class baritone?</i>

16:31.865 --> 16:34.326
<i>Yeah, he's a world-class jerk.</i>

16:34.410 --> 16:36.370
<i>He throws things at people. </i>

16:36.453 --> 16:38.205
<i>He flies into fits of rage for no reason.</i>

16:38.288 --> 16:40.541
<i>-Oh?</i>
<i>-Diane wanted to bring him down.</i>

16:40.624 --> 16:42.084
<i>I told her it would end her.</i>

16:42.167 --> 16:43.127
<i>Sounds like it did.</i>

16:44.044 --> 16:46.714
<i>So you think Niels is behind this?</i>

16:56.974 --> 16:58.642
<i>[crows cawing]</i>

17:01.020 --> 17:02.521
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

<i>So damn much, Charlotte.</i>

17:07.985 --> 17:10.070
<i>You fought so hard to be a better person.</i>

17:12.239 --> 17:14.366
<i>And you made me believe</i>
<i>I could be better, too.</i>

17:16.118 --> 17:17.077
<i>[sighs]</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:18.579
<i>And I'm trying.</i>

17:20.622 --> 17:22.124

17:23.000 --> 17:24.418
<i>And now I've seen something.</i>

<i>Something that proves just how important</i>
<i>it is to get it right.</i>

17:33.844 --> 17:34.845
<i>To be good.</i>

17:35.929 --> 17:37.264
<i>[whimpers softly]</i>

<i>And the good news is I'm--</i>

17:39.558 --> 17:41.560
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>this means that you're in Heaven,</i>

17:41.643 --> 17:42.978
<i>just like Amenadiel said.</i>

17:47.107 --> 17:49.485
<i>But the bad news is</i>
<i>I don't think I'm gonna be joining you.</i>

17:49.568 --> 17:50.444
<i>[sobs]</i>

17:54.490 --> 17:56.492

19:43.307 --> 19:44.975
<i>and we can't question Niels</i>

19:45.058 --> 19:46.226
<i>'cause he's in the air,</i>

19:46.310 --> 19:48.478
<i>flying back from a performance </i>
<i>in New York.</i>

19:49.229 --> 19:53.567
<i>So, really, there's nothing we can do</i>
<i>until he lands.</i>

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
<i>I disagree.</i>

19:56.361 --> 19:58.113
<i>[gasps] Lucifer.</i>

19:58.197 --> 20:00.365
<i>As fun as it is to watch you use my...</i>

<i>I mean, </i>our, <i>but really </i>my<i> mojo,</i>

20:03.118 --> 20:04.578
<i>I'd like it back. So...</i>

20:05.120 --> 20:07.122

20:07.206 --> 20:08.040
<i>[Chloe chuckles]</i>

20:08.749 --> 20:10.542
<i>Do you really think that's going to work?</i>

20:11.418 --> 20:14.213
<i>As if your mojo is some sort of STD?</i>

20:14.755 --> 20:18.091
<i>[scoffs] Well, we have to try something.</i>

20:20.093 --> 20:22.137
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>This is really getting to you, huh?</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:23.263
<i>[sighs]</i>

20:24.139 --> 20:25.098
<i>Trust me,</i>

20:25.182 --> 20:30.229
<i>it's not like I don't want to have sex</i>
<i>with you, because I really, really do,</i>

20:30.312 --> 20:33.649
<i>but... putting this kind of agenda on it,</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:36.068
<i>it just sucks all the fun out of it.</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:39.738
<i>Yeah, and please do not make a pun</i>
<i>right now because I...</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
<i>I am a little worried</i>

20:42.324 --> 20:45.494
<i>that you're having such a hard time</i>
<i>sharing this with me, because...</i>

20:46.245 --> 20:48.372
<i>relationships are about give-and-take.</i>

20:48.455 --> 20:52.459
<i>Well, that's easy for you to say.</i>
<i>So far, it's all, "I give and you take."</i>

20:52.542 --> 20:54.795
<i>I mean emotionally, Lucifer.</i>

20:57.297 --> 20:58.382
<i>Oh...</i>

20:59.049 --> 21:01.760
<i>I know exactly what you mean. [chuckles]</i>

21:02.552 --> 21:03.929
<i>So, couples therapy?</i>

21:04.554 --> 21:07.933
<i>When we've been a couple for, what,</i>
<i>five seconds?</i>

21:08.016 --> 21:10.227
<i>It's definitely not what I meant.</i>

21:10.310 --> 21:11.144
<i>I see.</i>

21:11.228 --> 21:15.357
<i>But I'm afraid, in order for this to work,</i>
<i>you both have to be willing to be here.</i>

21:15.440 --> 21:17.901
<i>-Well, she said she was happy to do this.</i>
<i>-No, no, I'm happy.</i>

21:18.318 --> 21:19.403
<i>I'm happy to be here.</i>

21:19.486 --> 21:22.030
<i>I'm thrilled, actually,</i>
<i>to have someone rational</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:24.491
<i>weigh in on all of this</i>
<i>and agree with this.</i>

21:24.574 --> 21:26.702
<i>I mean, Lucifer's being ridiculous, okay?</i>

21:27.244 --> 21:28.704
<i>Can you please tell him</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:32.624
<i>that it makes zero sense</i>
<i>that I stole his mojo during sex?</i>

21:32.708 --> 21:34.209
<i>-[mock chuckle]</i>
<i>-Okay, well,</i>

21:34.293 --> 21:37.296
<i>actually, I don't think </i>
<i>Lucifer is being...</i>

21:38.422 --> 21:39.589
<i>that ridiculous.</i>

21:40.632 --> 21:41.508
<i>-You don't?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

21:41.591 --> 21:44.386
<i>It's not like we covered celestial powers</i>
<i>in med school.</i>

21:44.469 --> 21:46.513
<i>-[Lucifer chuckles] </i>
<i>-But having sex with someone</i>

21:46.596 --> 21:48.098
<i>you truly care about</i>

21:48.181 --> 21:51.685
<i>requires surrendering control,</i>
<i>giving up power.</i>

21:52.352 --> 21:53.729
<i>And on an emotional level,</i>

21:53.812 --> 21:57.482
<i>Lucifer's reasoning does make</i>
<i>some amount of sense.</i>

21:57.566 --> 21:58.984
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

21:59.067 --> 22:03.613
<i>And the fact that he came to this</i>
<i>emotionally mature insight on his own...</i>

22:04.448 --> 22:05.365
<i>Impressive.</i>

22:05.449 --> 22:07.367
<i>Shows a sign that he's grown.</i>

22:07.659 --> 22:08.535
<i>Bully for me.</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:11.246
<i>Now can we jump to the part</i>
<i>where you teach the detective how to,</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:13.165
<i>you know, return my mojo?</i>

22:13.248 --> 22:15.584
<i>Yeah... Scratch emotional maturity.</i>

22:16.251 --> 22:19.338
<i>Okay, so, look.</i>
<i>Try to put yourself in Lucifer's shoes.</i>

22:19.421 --> 22:20.547
<i>For instance,</i>

22:20.630 --> 22:22.674
<i>what if your gun and badge</i>
<i>were taken away,</i>

22:22.758 --> 22:24.634
<i>only to be given to Lucifer?</i>

22:24.718 --> 22:26.470
<i>Liking the sound of that. Go on.</i>

22:26.553 --> 22:28.680
<i>I'm sorry, I'm-- I'm not following.</i>

22:28.764 --> 22:31.475
<i>Being a detective is a big part</i>
<i>of your identity.</i>

22:31.558 --> 22:32.559
<i>It empowers you.</i>

22:33.060 --> 22:34.770
<i>Now imagine losing it.</i>

22:35.270 --> 22:37.731
<i>Okay, Lucifer's issues</i>
<i>can sometimes seem...</i>

22:38.148 --> 22:40.400
<i>"Outlandish" would be putting it mildly.</i>

22:41.068 --> 22:43.111
<i>-[scoffs]</i>
<i>-But the one thing that I've learned</i>

<i>sometimes deep, deep, </i>deep<i> down,</i>

22:50.660 --> 22:52.329

31:31.931 --> 31:34.976
<i>The flowers that we thought were Diane's,</i>
<i>I mean, this is his signature.</i>

31:35.059 --> 31:37.478
<i>I should have known. I should have known.</i>

31:37.562 --> 31:40.398
<i>The first crime scene was so clean.</i>
<i>It was too clean.</i>

31:40.481 --> 31:42.692
<i>[splutters] It was so meticulously staged.</i>

31:42.775 --> 31:45.361
<i>Don't beat yourself up, Ella.</i>
<i>It's not gonna do any good.</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:47.405
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe he made a mistake this time.</i>

31:47.488 --> 31:48.698
<i>Yeah, I thought he had, too,</i>

31:48.781 --> 31:52.160
<i>when I found this on her clothes,</i>
<i>but dead end.</i>

31:52.660 --> 31:54.871
<i>Glitter's just an occupational hazard</i>
<i>for Madison.</i>

31:54.954 --> 31:57.081
<i>Oh, no, she was a stripper.</i>

31:57.165 --> 31:58.583
<i>No, elementary school teacher.</i>

31:58.666 --> 32:02.337
<i>All the killer left behind</i>
<i>was stuff he wanted us to find.</i>

32:02.420 --> 32:05.798
<i>Right. Well, white Stargazer lilies</i>
<i>are pretty rare,</i>

32:05.882 --> 32:07.800
<i>so we can call local retailers,</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:10.845
<i>have them let us know</i>
<i>of any sales in the last 24 hours.</i>

32:10.929 --> 32:13.056
<i>We're looking for opportunity,</i>
<i>victim connections.</i>

32:13.139 --> 32:14.182
<i>We'll build a profile.</i>

32:14.265 --> 32:18.227
<i>This killer's MO is extremely unique.</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:19.896
<i>Slashing vocal cords.</i>

32:20.647 --> 32:21.773
<i>Why would anybody do that?</i>

32:21.856 --> 32:25.360
<i>I don't know. Maybe, uh, he wanted</i>
<i>to take away their voice?</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:26.527
<i>No.</i>

32:31.240 --> 32:33.284
<i>He wants to take away their power.</i>

32:35.161 --> 32:37.664
<i>♪ I'm bad as bad can be ♪</i>

32:37.747 --> 32:40.667
<i>♪ So bad </i>
<i>That it's hard to believe ♪</i>

32:41.125 --> 32:44.087
<i>♪ Oh what they say about me</i>
<i>I'm bad ♪</i>

32:44.170 --> 32:47.799
<i>Okay, so my friend at the FBI</i>
<i>got a couple hits off of ViCAP.</i>

32:48.466 --> 32:51.386
<i>Olivia Sacks, murdered in Phoenix,</i>

32:51.469 --> 32:53.429
<i>last year 27, same MO.</i>

32:53.513 --> 32:54.681
<i>Same signature.</i>

32:54.764 --> 32:55.598
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:56.015 --> 32:58.184
<i>This is Joy Goodman, 32.</i>

32:58.267 --> 32:59.936
<i>She was reported missing three years ago,</i>

33:00.019 --> 33:02.939
<i>but her body surfaced</i>
<i>in San Antonio last summer.</i>

33:03.022 --> 33:04.148
<i>He dumped it?</i>

33:04.607 --> 33:08.277
<i>So slashed vocal cords,</i>
<i>but no lilies found with the body.</i>

33:08.361 --> 33:09.988
<i>That's why it was hard</i>
<i>to connect the dots,</i>

33:10.071 --> 33:11.906
<i>too many differences</i>
<i>between the two scenes,</i>

33:11.990 --> 33:13.491
<i>too much distance, too much time.</i>

33:13.574 --> 33:15.994
<i>Now he has struck twice in the same city.</i>

33:16.077 --> 33:18.871
<i>Yep, and he's picking up the pace.</i>
<i>His cooling-off period is shrinking.</i>

33:18.955 --> 33:20.331
<i>We're gonna catch him, Decker.</i>

33:23.126 --> 33:26.170
<i>Ella, why are you so optimistic</i>
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

33:27.338 --> 33:28.673
<i>Well, I... I talked to Pete.</i>

33:29.716 --> 33:32.885
<i>Yeah, and he said to stop focusing</i>
<i>on what I got wrong</i>

33:32.969 --> 33:35.388
<i>and instead focus</i>
<i>on what I can still get right.</i>

33:35.471 --> 33:36.681
<i>I can still help, Chloe.</i>

33:36.764 --> 33:39.225
<i>I can still help catch this killer</i>
<i>before he hurts anybody else.</i>

33:39.308 --> 33:41.352
<i>I'm just so glad</i>
<i>you found a good guy, Ella.</i>

33:41.436 --> 33:42.520
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

33:43.062 --> 33:45.857
<i>It's just really nice to have somebody</i>
<i>in your corner, you know?</i>

33:46.482 --> 33:49.193
<i>I don't know, he just makes me feel</i>
<i>less powerless.</i>

33:50.820 --> 33:52.572
<i>Cocozza told me to give you this.</i>

33:53.448 --> 33:55.908
<i>Oh, great, </i>
<i>the leads from the flower shops.</i>

33:55.992 --> 33:57.660
<i>Let's go follow up, shall we?</i>

33:58.202 --> 34:00.038
<i>I could really use your help out there.</i>

34:01.330 --> 34:02.248
<i>[chuckles]</i>

34:02.540 --> 34:04.542
<i>-How can I refuse?</i>
<i>-[Chloe chuckles]</i>

34:13.760 --> 34:15.344
<i>How many more of these to go, Detective?</i>

34:15.428 --> 34:17.930
<i>I'm starting to think</i>
<i>our killer grows the flowers himself.</i>

34:18.014 --> 34:20.475
<i>Well, this is the second-to-last shop</i>
<i>on the list,</i>

34:20.558 --> 34:22.143
<i>-so fingers crossed.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

34:22.268 --> 34:23.436
<i>Uh, excuse me, Danilo?</i>

34:23.519 --> 34:24.979
<i>I'm Detective Decker.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.398
<i>You called about a bouquet of lilies</i>
<i>you sold yesterday.</i>

34:27.482 --> 34:30.610
<i>Yeah, I placed the call,</i>
<i>but it's my grandma who sold them.</i>

34:30.693 --> 34:33.321
<i>-Great, can we speak with her?</i>
<i>-She doesn't really speak English.</i>

34:33.404 --> 34:35.156
<i>Oh! Well, that's not a problem.</i>

34:35.239 --> 34:37.658
<i>My wonderful partner here</i>
<i>speaks every language.</i>

34:38.367 --> 34:39.827
<i>-I'm so lucky you're here.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

34:42.830 --> 34:44.874
<i>[speaking Tagalog]</i>

34:44.999 --> 34:47.418
<i>But fair warning, she doesn't like cops.</i>

34:48.169 --> 34:49.545
<i>-[blade slices loudly]</i>
<i>-Oh...</i>

34:50.463 --> 34:52.548
<i>She's pretty mad that I called you guys.</i>

34:52.632 --> 34:53.883
<i>Well, also not a problem.</i>

34:53.966 --> 34:55.635
<i>-My partner is not a cop.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

34:55.927 --> 34:57.261
<i>He has many connections,</i>

34:57.345 --> 35:00.473
<i>he can grant favors,</i>
<i>and obviously is very charming.</i>

35:00.556 --> 35:03.684
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-He's like my very own Swiss Army knife.</i>

35:03.768 --> 35:05.228
<i>Would you please speak to the lady?</i>

35:05.311 --> 35:07.772
<i>Well, after a buildup like that,</i>
<i>how could I refuse?</i>

35:07.855 --> 35:08.815
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:08.898 --> 35:10.650

35:12.318 --> 35:15.029
<i>[woman speaking Tagalog]</i>

35:16.280 --> 35:18.533
<i>Excuse me, do you use that ribbon</i>
<i>on every bouquet?</i>

35:18.616 --> 35:20.243
<i>Yep. Grandma insists on it.</i>

35:22.995 --> 35:23.996
<i>It's the glitter.</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:24.914
<i>Lucifer.</i>

35:28.543 --> 35:31.838
<i>Uh... do you remember the golden glitter</i>
<i>that Ella found at the crime scene?</i>

35:31.921 --> 35:32.964
<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-Look at the ribbon.</i>

35:33.840 --> 35:34.882
<i>Has to be our guy.</i>

35:35.466 --> 35:38.761
<i>Right. Well, the lilies were bought</i>
<i>by a middle-aged man.</i>

35:38.845 --> 35:40.346
<i>Unfortunately he paid in cash,</i>

35:40.429 --> 35:41.556
<i>but my new friend, Jovita,</i>

35:42.390 --> 35:45.810

<i>and that she saw him leave in an Uber.</i>

35:45.893 --> 35:47.520
<i>Uber? Great.</i>

35:47.603 --> 35:49.063

<i>Well, I guess it is about her,</i>

<i>You did.</i>

<i>And you've come such a long way, Maze.</i>

<i>Grown so much.</i>

37:57.942 --> 37:59.235
<i>Apparently not enough.</i>

<i>I don't know if a soul is what you need</i>
<i>to feel whole, but...</i>

38:29.307 --> 38:30.433
<i>I do know this.</i>

<i>If anyone is going to find</i>

<i>We got the warrant.</i>

<i>Go ahead. Let's get this bastard.</i>

<i>Right.</i>

<i>[Chloe] We have to ID her ASAP,</i>

<i>Is there anything useful over there?</i>

<i>Nothing.</i>

<i>This monster's robbing people of</i>

<i>Lucifer, you don't have to do this</i>

<i>We're a team, you know?</i>

40:47.945 --> 40:49.738
<i>When will Miss Lopez arrive, exactly?</i>

40:51.073 --> 40:53.075
<i>She said they were close,</i>
<i>so any minute now.</i>

<i>"They"?</i>

<i>If there's anything I can do </i>
<i>to help, um...</i>

<i>Great, yes. We're on the clock,</i>
<i>so I'll take any help I can get.</i>

<i>Our killer is attacking women</i>
<i>in their homes.</i>

<i>And we think this might be</i>
<i>his next victim.</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:12.636
<i>[Chloe] So if we're gonna get to her</i>
<i>before he does,</i>

41:12.720 --> 41:14.763
<i>we have to figure out where she lives.</i>

41:14.847 --> 41:17.933
<i>So just scour this place for any clues</i>
<i>you can find, okay? Let's go.</i>

41:18.017 --> 41:19.935
<i>[Ella] Okay. Here.</i>

41:20.019 --> 41:21.312

<i>Is that...</i>

42:29.547 --> 42:30.923
<i>Holy cow, Ells.</i>

42:31.006 --> 42:32.758
<i>[both] I think we found something.</i>

42:32.841 --> 42:34.009
<i>[Chloe] Coming.</i>

42:34.093 --> 42:35.844
<i>-What'd you find?</i>
<i>-Check it out.</i>

42:47.273 --> 42:50.901
<i>Chloe, I think that is his next victim.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:52.695
<i>Look at the wallpaper.</i>

42:52.778 --> 42:55.030
<i>-And the carpet. Does it ring a bell?</i>
<i>-Ring a bell?</i>

42:55.114 --> 42:56.657
<i>She lives in this apartment building.</i>

42:56.740 --> 42:58.325
<i>[Chloe] On the ninth floor.</i>

42:58.409 --> 42:59.577
