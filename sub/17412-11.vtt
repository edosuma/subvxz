My friend andy and I crushed the

   I gotta say, the highlight

07:56.610 --> 08:00.245
   Will: I appreciate you not
  raging against my euro sham,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.914
 But there's some ground rules
       while you're here

08:02.916 --> 08:04.616
   For this very brief stay.

08:04.618 --> 08:08.920
I need you to basically not talk
  so I can write a silky hook

08:08.922 --> 08:09.955
    That is eluding the crap
           out of me.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.556
          Here we go.

08:11.558 --> 08:12.958
  Marcus: You won't even know
       I'm here, roomie.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.795
Marcus: I'm going to go upstairs
 because if I don't get a good

08:16.797 --> 08:20.031
Soak in at night, I am basically
    useless in the morning.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.835
 Will: Okay, I got some lyrics,
       I got some music.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.237
      Let's bring it home.

08:25.239 --> 08:28.173
    Marcus: Uh, hey, roomie,
 sorry to interrupt your hook,

08:28.175 --> 08:29.841
     But I don't know where
        the bathtub is.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.843
 Will: I don't have a bathtub.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.246
     You can take a shower.
      Marcus: Oh, shower.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.214
         Will: Mm-hmm.
    Marcus: Yeah, I can rock

08:36.216 --> 08:38.183
           A shower.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.893
      Will: Okay, come on,
          come on now.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.095
         ¶ come to me ¶

08:50.097 --> 08:52.797
       ¶ my sweet hook ¶

08:52.799 --> 08:56.835
      ¶ could I find you ¶

08:56.837 --> 08:59.938
         ¶ in a book ¶

08:59.940 --> 09:01.006
            [sighs]

09:01.008 --> 09:05.810
      ¶ could I find you ¶

09:05.812 --> 09:07.879
         ¶ in a truck ¶

09:07.881 --> 09:09.548
   Oh, I'm gonna kill myself.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.016
            [splat]

09:13.286 --> 09:14.719
             What?

09:14.721 --> 09:15.887
            [splat]
              ugh!

09:15.889 --> 09:18.290
            Marcus!

09:18.292 --> 09:19.891
     Marcus, what the hell
         are you doing?

09:19.893 --> 09:23.028
   Marcus: Showering, roomie.
   Ooh, do you have a loofah?

09:23.030 --> 09:25.931
Will: What the hell is a loofah?
  Marcus: Ha ha! Look at that!

09:29.769 --> 09:32.304
       [gargling loudly]

09:32.306 --> 09:34.606
         Will: Marcus.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.341
            Marcus!

09:36.343 --> 09:39.344
         [upbeat music]

09:39.346 --> 09:40.979
              ¶ ¶

09:40.981 --> 09:42.747
 Man: ¶ I don't wanna go home ¶

09:42.749 --> 09:45.750
      ¶ I wanna stay until
      the sun is bright ¶

09:45.752 --> 09:46.952
          Marcus: Ooh!

09:46.954 --> 09:49.354
              ¶ ¶

09:49.356 --> 09:51.890
     Man: ¶ well, I'm never
         acting grown ¶

09:51.892 --> 09:55.126
 ¶ I'd rather do what makes me
        feel all right ¶

09:55.128 --> 09:58.229
              ¶ ¶

09:58.231 --> 09:59.598
           Will: Aah!

09:59.600 --> 10:02.133
  Man: ¶ through the outsides
           of rome ¶

10:02.135 --> 10:03.868
   ¶ crash on dirty couches ¶

10:03.870 --> 10:06.805
       ¶ eating breakfast
        off the floor ¶

10:06.807 --> 10:08.173
  ¶ slowly serving strangers ¶

10:08.175 --> 10:10.875
  ¶ in a place I hardly know ¶

10:10.877 --> 10:12.811
   ¶ I can't find the hotel ¶

10:12.813 --> 10:14.713
      ¶ they're all gone ¶

10:14.715 --> 10:16.181
     ¶ I'm here all alone ¶

10:16.183 --> 10:18.249
              ¶ ¶

10:18.251 --> 10:20.318
    ¶ don't wanna go home ¶

        ¶ the sun is up
   and it's way too bright ¶

10:23.991 --> 10:26.157
              ¶ ¶

10:26.159 --> 10:29.127
 Will: Fiona, okay, look, it's
    been more than one night

10:29.129 --> 10:34.165
  And marcus is still up there
 just gurgling and creaming up,

10:34.167 --> 10:36.868
      And mouth-breathing
      all over the place.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.271
     It's just killing me,
 and I can't focus on the song,

10:40.273 --> 10:42.040
 And I need you to do something
       about it, please.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.943
 Fiona: Will, it's killing me.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.746
     It is not easy for me.
     All I want is for him

10:47.748 --> 10:50.915
 To open his heart to chris so
 that the two wonderful, sweet

10:50.917 --> 10:53.351
 Men in my life can just enjoy
          each other.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.054
    Will: It's not like I'm
 unsympathetic to your plight,

10:56.056 --> 10:58.723
             Okay?
  I mean--well, actually I am.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.326
    Fiona: He saw him first.
 At school, even before I did.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.862
So why can't he see it at home?
  I mean, it's the same chris.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.065
   Will: Okay, you know what?
 I'm gonna lay it down for you.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.769
  I think you made a tactical
   error bringing chris home

11:10.771 --> 11:12.270
      To bond with marcus.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.772
    Fiona: What do you mean?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.974
  Will: You brought chris into
         marcus' space

11:15.976 --> 11:17.442
And that can be hard to handle,
           you know,

11:17.444 --> 11:19.778
 Males are kind of funky about
       that kinda thing.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.847
  You know, when I was a kid,
   we had a golden retriever

11:22.849 --> 11:24.215
        Named woof woof.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.151
 Fiona: That is a lovely breed.
        Will: Thank you.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.820
   Fiona: And a stupid name.
  Will: I am going to pretend

11:28.822 --> 11:30.755
 That you didn't just say that.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.758
   A few years later, we got
    a bernese mountain dog.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.694
       Fiona: Bark bark?
  Will: Really, really funny.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.896
          Keep it up.
    My mom said that before

11:37.898 --> 11:39.330
   We brought cassius home--
   fiona: That's a good name,

11:39.332 --> 11:40.398
           Isn't it?
      That's a good name.

11:40.400 --> 11:46.471
  Cassius and woof woof had to
  meet in a neutral location.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.973
     So they could get used
    to each other, you know?

11:48.975 --> 11:51.342
   Sniff each other's butts.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.847
        Fiona: Woof woof
  is the stupidest name ever.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.248
           Will: Hm.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.185
Marcus: My instincts are way out
      of whack here, will.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.287
  At first I thought you were
     tiring of my presence,

12:02.289 --> 12:04.889
But now we're two roomies going
        out on the town.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.324
   Will: Yeah, I mean there's
 nothing I'd rather being doing

12:06.326 --> 12:09.894
  Right now than slamming some
         vegan hibachi.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.497
 Marcus: Man, I cannot tell you
   how great it feels to not

12:12.499 --> 12:15.867
         Have something
    or someone forced on me.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.502
 I love living under your roof,
             will.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.873
And some rooves are underrated.
      Roofs? Roo--rooves?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.976
Woman: We only do shared tables,
         so here we go.

12:24.978 --> 12:28.313
     Will: Sit down here...
          Oh, my god!

12:28.315 --> 12:29.948
    Look at--what are the--

12:29.950 --> 12:32.784
      Surprise, surprise!
What are the odds, right there?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.919
         Fiona: Hello!
       Chris: Hey, guys.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.323
     Marcus: <i> Et tu, brute?</i>

12:38.325 --> 12:42.260
  That's william shakespeare--
  marcus: It's always a lesson

12:42.262 --> 12:43.962
         With this guy.
       Fiona: Oh, golly.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.431
         Shall we eat?
Marcus: A moment alone with you,

12:46.433 --> 12:47.532
            Roomie?
       Will: Oh, sidebar.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.001
        That sounds fun.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.804
     Chris: <i> "et tu, brute."</i>

12:55.341 --> 12:55.774
               .

12:55.776 --> 12:59.477
  Will: I know, I know, it was
       a little bit weak,

12:59.479 --> 13:01.246
  But you gotta understand my
           situation.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.181
 I got a golden opportunity to
      make a ton of money

13:03.183 --> 13:07.185
Marcus: I don't want to be here
  with mr. Chris or my mother.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.521
     So if you're leaving,
          I'm leaving.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.423
    Will: Marcus, I need to
      concentrate at home.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.125
      I gotta come up with
        this sweet hook,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.961
 And I just need some peace and
    quiet to really get it.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.464
  And I can't do it if you're
  flopping around the shower.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.300
   Marcus: If you're leaving,
          I'm leaving.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.935
     Look, we can get some
     quinoa mushroom balls

13:23.937 --> 13:26.304
     And pear sauce to go.
 They're famous for them here,

13:26.306 --> 13:29.974
     And it would be a sin
          to miss out.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.577
  Fiona: Well, I know we came
  together a bit inelegantly,

13:32.579 --> 13:35.380
  But I really feel that if we
        open our hearts,

13:35.382 --> 13:39.584
   We could have a meaningful
  and maybe a wonderful time.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.487
Will: Honestly, this menu reads
   like a stephen king novel.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.023
It's more unsettling the deeper
        you get into it.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.026
 Fiona: Um, marcus, chris said
    that you said something

13:48.028 --> 13:50.595
Rather brilliant in class today.
      Chris: That's right.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.231
  Um, we were going over latin
          root words,

13:53.233 --> 13:56.467
   And I brought up "gress,"
   meaning to step or to go.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.136
   Such as progress, to step
      forward or digress,

13:58.138 --> 13:59.337
       To step backward.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.839
  Will: This is a long story,
           isn't it?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.040
  Chris: And then I brought up
           congress,

14:02.042 --> 14:06.110
 And marcus said, "but the u.S.
   Congress is more likely to

14:06.112 --> 14:07.612
"step outside and beat the crap
       out of each other

14:07.614 --> 14:10.048
Because they can't come together
           on squat."

14:10.050 --> 14:13.484
Fiona: Oh, that is so brilliant!
  [forced laugh] so relevant.

14:13.486 --> 14:17.121
Chris: Oh, yeah, no, I gave him
      a standing ovation,

14:17.123 --> 14:21.059
    Which is from the latin
"ovatio", which means "I exult."

14:21.061 --> 14:24.562
 Will: What's latin for boring?
       Marcus: [snickers]

14:24.564 --> 14:26.331
   Fiona: Are we opening our
hearts, or are we shutting them

14:26.333 --> 14:29.334
 Will: Hey, guys, I don't see a
     lick of meat on here.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.402
    I'm gonna go next door,
     get a half-pound patty

14:31.404 --> 14:33.438
     From the burger joint,
    throw it on the hibachi.

14:33.440 --> 14:38.276
 There's a veritable cornucopia
of delectable items on this menu

14:38.278 --> 14:40.211
 That aren't meat that are far
  more amicable to your heart

14:40.213 --> 14:42.380
      And digestive tract.
       For example, the--

14:42.382 --> 14:45.450
  The vegan pho is quite nice,
        and the luc lac

14:45.452 --> 14:47.986
 Is a vietnamese lentil steak,
          where they--

14:47.988 --> 14:49.354
   Will: What do you think's
            grosser?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.957
    Eating lentil luc lacs,
  or pooping lentil luc lacs.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.225
        Marcus: [laughs]

14:54.227 --> 14:56.327
  Fiona: Um, a word with you,
       please, neighbor.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.229
       Will: What, what?
       Fiona: Over here.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.565
  Will: I was just over there.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.436
    Fiona: Are you aware how
         disrespectful

15:05.438 --> 15:07.372
 You're being to chris, or are
      you merely clueless

15:07.374 --> 15:09.073
As well as being a giant moron?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.942
 Will: Excuse me, I did my job.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.078
  I got everyone all together,
   now I just want to go home

15:14.080 --> 15:17.015
  So I can work on my hook in
        peace and quiet.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.183
 Fiona: Marcus is not going to
       come home with me

15:19.185 --> 15:21.352
    Unless you stop mocking
           mr. Chris.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.921
        Will: [mocking]
       luc lac, luc lac?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.422
    You gotta be kidding me.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.124
          Fiona: Will,
      marcus idolizes you.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.359
  If you're nice to mr. Chris,
        he will be too.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.396
   Will: I can't believe I'm
    embroiled in this plan.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.464
 And now you want me to be nice
           to that...

15:33.466 --> 15:35.967
     What's the latin word
          for "tool?"

15:35.969 --> 15:37.402
      Fiona: <i> Instrumentum.</i>
        Will: Thank you.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.138
 Will: Alright, you know what?
     I will try to be nice

15:40.140 --> 15:43.408
 To that blowhard <i> instrumentum,</i>

15:43.410 --> 15:46.978
Just so marcus can get out of my
    house and I can finally

15:46.980 --> 15:49.280
    Work on this hook, okay?
       Fiona: Thank you.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.084
   Will: What does that mean?
    Fiona: It's a body part.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.721
      Will: Mm, so chris,
  it sounds like you're quite

15:56.723 --> 15:59.524
      The world traveler?
 Chris: That is correct, yeah.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.193
       I have--I've been
     to all six continents.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.295
  I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking there are seven.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.331
     But most geographers,
     myself included, agree

16:06.333 --> 16:07.665
     That europe and asia,
         it's really--

16:07.667 --> 16:10.435
 It's just the same land mass.
         Fiona: It is.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.437
Will: Yeah, I definitely wasn't
         thinking that.

16:14.406 --> 16:17.408
              No.
   So...I been to barcelona.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.010
   Do we have that in common?
    Chris: You are correct,

16:19.012 --> 16:21.179
           Good sir.
    Yes, I love barthelona.

16:21.181 --> 16:25.450
Tell me that you were not blown
   away by the dragon-curved

16:25.452 --> 16:28.353
Rooftop of gaudi's casa batllo.
           Will: No,

16:28.355 --> 16:31.589
      But I was blown away
       by the curved body

16:31.591 --> 16:34.258
  Of a cocktail waitress named
          "ithavella".

16:34.260 --> 16:35.526
    Chris: Hm, I'm not sure
           "isabella"

16:35.528 --> 16:37.462
    Was on the walking tour.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.464
     I did happen to catch
     an fc barcelona match

16:39.466 --> 16:42.066
And while the fans were as wild
         as advertised,

16:42.068 --> 16:44.502
    That's nothing compared
       to a niners game.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.272
  Will: Oh, so you're a niners
              fan?

16:48.274 --> 16:51.576
 Will: What, like a real freak,
    or like bandwagon freak?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.411
Chris: Well, one of the greatest
      days of my life was

16:53.413 --> 16:56.214
 The '94 nfc championship game
    where the niners beat--

16:56.216 --> 16:57.348
         Will: Cowboys.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.552
 Will: Dude, I was at that game
        with my father.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.054
        Chris: Come on.
      Will: Yeah, I was on

17:03.056 --> 17:04.622
       The 40-yard line.
 I was there, I was right there

17:04.624 --> 17:05.790
   When eric davis picked off
         aikman's pass,

17:05.791 --> 17:07.392
     Took it to the house!

17:07.394 --> 17:09.394
   Chris: And then young hits
  ricky watters who showboats

17:09.396 --> 17:10.428
       Into the end zone.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.195
  Will: You know, he's like...

17:12.198 --> 17:15.333
     Chris: Oh, and then we
  steamrolled 'em from there.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.402
  Will: Yeah, we took down the
  chargers in the super bowl.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.238
 Chris: But it was beating the
 cowboys that made it so sweet.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.205
    Will: The sweetest, man.
       It's still sweet!

17:22.208 --> 17:23.508
          Chris: Yes!
   Marcus: Are you kidding me

17:23.510 --> 17:25.510
           Right now?
 First you steal my mom and now

17:25.512 --> 17:27.111
     You're trying to steal
        my best friend?

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
        I'm out of here.
         Chris: Marcus.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.648
        Fiona: Darling!

17:32.184 --> 17:34.485
 Marcus: Quinoa mushroom balls
      are coming with me,

17:34.487 --> 17:37.789
 For they have not betrayed me.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.129
               .

17:45.131 --> 17:51.669
As a peace treaty, but I'm fresh
 out of quinoa mushroom balls.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.472
     Marcus: You know what
     hurts the most, will?

17:54.474 --> 17:57.141
         Will: Tell me.

17:59.144 --> 18:03.114
  Marcus: It's that the entire
    23 hours and 18 minutes

18:03.116 --> 18:06.350
 I've been gone, my mom hasn't
           missed me.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.820
       Not even a little.
  Will: Marcus, you know that

18:08.822 --> 18:10.521
          Isn't true.
Marcus: Thanks for coming here,

18:10.523 --> 18:15.126
Will, but your words won't make
   me feel better this time.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.795
          Will: Okay.

18:17.797 --> 18:22.800
   Maybe your mother's will.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.602
 Fiona: Hey, will, it's fiona.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.271
Marcus just left my house about
         20 seconds ago

18:27.273 --> 18:29.474
   And I wanted to make sure
       he arrived safely.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.109
     Hey, will, it's fiona.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.812
  It's been almost 4 minutes,
         and I haven't

18:34.814 --> 18:39.150
       Heard from marcus.
       Is my lovey okay?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.853
          It's fiona.
         Has he bathed?

18:41.855 --> 18:44.155
          Is he warm?
          Does he need

18:44.157 --> 18:46.424
   A good night kiss from me?

18:46.426 --> 18:47.592
            [crying]
     please don't give him

18:47.594 --> 18:48.726
       A good night kiss.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.862
         That's my job.
            [kisses]

18:50.864 --> 18:53.598
    I do miss you, darling.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.169
 It's fiona. I'm just thinking
 about my sweet little chicken.

18:58.171 --> 19:02.874
  I've got my arms out because
   I wish I were holding him.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.877
  Every time I've ever held my
           arms out,

19:05.879 --> 19:07.812
   He's always come running.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.616
   Mommy's got her arms out,
            darling.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.652
   Mommy's got her arms out.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.289
         [door closes]

19:28.367 --> 19:29.667
     Marcus: You missed me.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.236
  Fiona: Every single second.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.539
  You know, I've been thinking
  a lot about our love bubble.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.174
     Marcus: What about it?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.877
Fiona: Well, we let will into it
   and it didn't pop, did it?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.184
     Marcus: It didn't pop.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.720
Fiona: Darling, no matter who is
          in my life,

19:49.722 --> 19:52.890
 I'll always make room for you
       in my love bubble.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.971
       [soft rock music]

20:06.973 --> 20:12.210
              ¶ ¶

20:12.212 --> 20:14.412
    Will: ¶ I've got room ¶

20:14.414 --> 20:17.381
    ¶ there's always room ¶

20:17.383 --> 20:23.454
 ¶ in my love bubble for you ¶

20:23.456 --> 20:25.223
      Johnny: Love bubble?

20:27.859 --> 20:29.427
           I like it.
           Will: Yes!

20:29.429 --> 20:30.962
             Yeah!
             Whoo!

20:30.964 --> 20:32.964
       Johnny: But this?
     Two guys in a minivan,

20:32.966 --> 20:34.432
         That's creepy,
      you gotta stop that.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.234
    You ever heard of email?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.935
Will: He's right, I told you it
          was creepy.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.972
    We should've brought one
   of your kids, I told you.

20:40.974 --> 20:41.906
         Andy: My kids!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.908
  I forgot the kids at school!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.977
    Laurie's gonna kill me!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.714
Marcus: Hey, mom, whatcha doing?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.983
 Fiona: I'm making mushroom and
         quinoa balls,

20:51.985 --> 20:54.352
But they're not really boiling,
           are they?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.753
   Suppose I could loaf them.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.322
Marcus: Nobody loafs it better.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.459
         Loafs, loaves?
Fiona: I think it can be either.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.594
 Marcus: Oh, hey, I set up our
   paint our feelings night.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.796
        Go check it out!
           Fiona: Oh.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.969
  Why are there three easels?

21:11.971 --> 21:15.773
 Will: ¶ in my love bubble for
             you ¶

21:15.775 --> 21:21.345
  Chris: So thanks to marcus,
I'm no longer <i> persona non grata.</i>

21:21.347 --> 21:23.781
  Marcus: Okay, let's keep the
     latin in school, huh?
