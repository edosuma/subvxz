11:25.989 --> 11:28.165
- Not cheat, pick.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.865
It's my ladies' garden club
perennial orchid competition,

11:31.908 --> 11:34.389
and, well, I wanna win.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.739
- But none of them
are Magicians, right?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.088
- Yeah, but that
doesn't mean they're not

11:38.132 --> 11:39.524
a bunch of mean old twats.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.744
- Mom, this is not
an emergency.

11:41.788 --> 11:45.182
- Yes it is.
There's too much magic, Alice.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.271
Everything that I touch
just...

11:47.315 --> 11:48.533
[knock at door]
It grows like crazy.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.840
- I'll get it.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.023
- Hey, uh, can I come in?

12:08.292 --> 12:11.426
- Uh, welcome to Introductory
Psychic Translocation.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.689
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.867
I see you have your
Umar, Kaminsky, Aurora...

12:18.999 --> 12:22.829
See, I always thought
books would help, but...

12:24.482 --> 12:26.528
The only problem is,
books make you think

12:26.571 --> 12:28.617
you can do something
that you shouldn't.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.750
Anyone hearing other
people's thoughts yet?

12:31.881 --> 12:34.710
Cool, you're gonna wanna
get some psychic wards

12:34.754 --> 12:36.712
to block that
shit out right now.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.801
The truth?
Being a traveler is a curse.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.324
Best case scenario?

12:40.368 --> 12:41.804
You end up a taxi service
for your friends.

12:41.848 --> 12:42.979
Worst case?

12:43.023 --> 12:44.285
You dream about volcanoes,

12:44.328 --> 12:45.765
and then you wake up in one.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.551
What?

12:49.594 --> 12:50.813
- Yeah,

12:50.857 --> 12:52.684
are you actually
gonna teach us something

12:52.728 --> 12:55.557
or are you just gonna
keep trying to scare us?

12:57.689 --> 12:58.778
- Look, man,

12:58.821 --> 13:00.649
I'm trying to be real
with you.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.346
You should be scared.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.653
I mean, have you even
actually traveled?

13:04.696 --> 13:06.307
Anyone?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.613
Okay...seriously,

13:08.657 --> 13:10.267
get an anti-traveling tattoo

13:10.311 --> 13:12.748
and then just go.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.402
Enjoy your life.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.838
'Cause it'd be
a hell of a lot longer

13:15.882 --> 13:17.884
than if you stick around
with this shit.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.407
End of class.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.582
Peace.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.370
- I miss him too,
but

13:26.414 --> 13:27.850
a séance?

13:27.894 --> 13:29.634
- Well, I wanted
to talk to him,

13:29.678 --> 13:30.940
and then I realized

13:30.984 --> 13:32.681
what if I could?

13:32.724 --> 13:33.638
You know, what if we could?

13:34.988 --> 13:38.774
- Actually talking
to the dead is wild magic.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.776
It's way too dangerous.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.647
- Well, then what should I do?

13:42.691 --> 13:45.041
Because I don't know, and
the person I wanna ask...

13:45.085 --> 13:47.348
is Q.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.832
- I miss him every day too.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.749
I honestly don't know
how to move on without him.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.969
I just--but we have to, right?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.472
- I found it.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.039
It was his.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.999
- [sniffles]

14:30.043 --> 14:32.349
- His notes are
written in the margin.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.967
- What a nerd.

14:45.841 --> 14:49.497
- Can't talk to him,
but...can read it.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.849
Picture what he was thinking.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.549
Next best thing.

15:01.988 --> 15:02.945
[knock at door]

15:05.078 --> 15:06.688
- Um...

15:06.731 --> 15:07.907
is Kady here?

15:10.126 --> 15:11.823
- Let me get this straight.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.087
Your friend tried
to remove your Reed's Mark

15:14.130 --> 15:15.827
with magic, and...

15:15.871 --> 15:17.829
- Blew my arm off, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.873 --> 15:18.961
- I still can't cast, either.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.876
- Why not go to a hospital?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.138
- I don't have
health insurance.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.012
- I know a spell.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.143
Might make you vomit, though.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.710
- Like a lot?

15:28.753 --> 15:29.711
- One-armed beggars

15:29.754 --> 15:31.408
can't be one-arm choosers.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.029
- Hold his arm in place.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.857
- Wait, wait, wait--
how much throw-up, really?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.948
- [speaks Hebrew]

15:50.775 --> 15:53.126
- [laughs]
Wow, thank--

15:53.169 --> 15:54.431
[retches]

15:59.045 --> 16:01.221
- Uh-oh.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.787
You got that look, boss.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.006
- That guy...

16:04.050 --> 16:06.574
he was so afraid
of not having magic,

16:06.617 --> 16:07.879
he was willing to risk

16:07.923 --> 16:09.185
blowing his own arm off
to get it back.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.231
- That guy was an idiot.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.755
- Or maybe just desperate.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.887
- So what?
It's hard to be a Hedge?

16:15.931 --> 16:17.063
It's always been hard.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.934
- We could at least
defend ourselves.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.502
I thought with magic back,
things would get better.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.069
The Library promised they'd
remove all of Reed's Marks,

16:23.112 --> 16:24.592
and they haven't.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.854
- Are you surprised?

16:25.897 --> 16:28.596
I hear the Library's
falling apart.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.599
So I doubt that
fixing hedge witches

16:31.642 --> 16:33.601
ranks high on their to-do list.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.820
- Well, I'm done waiting.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.648
There's tons of magic now,

16:37.692 --> 16:40.608
so let's figure out a way
to remove them ourselves.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.784
- If you're serious,

16:42.827 --> 16:45.569
I heard about a guy
who might be able to help.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.225
- An Order of the Library
of the Neitherlands

16:49.269 --> 16:51.793
medical manual should have
the ritual you're looking for.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.577
- And why should we trust you?

16:53.621 --> 16:55.623
- 'Cause I don't give
a rat's tit about the Library.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.233
Never have.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.018
I don't even read books.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.499
- But you worked for them.
- Not anymore.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.893
Contracts aren't valid
once the place collapses.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.636
Besides, I'm chaotic neutral,

17:08.679 --> 17:10.203
so I do a lot
of crazy shit...

17:10.246 --> 17:12.814
for cash.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.120
And since we're not
here to ---- spiders,

17:14.163 --> 17:15.643
you can pay, can't you?

17:15.686 --> 17:16.992
- We can pay.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.646
- How soon can you
get us the manual?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.648
- [laughs]
I'm not getting it for you.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.258
I'll just tell you
where you can find it.

17:22.302 --> 17:25.000
A former Library book
depository no one's hit yet.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.828
They'll have one...

17:26.871 --> 17:28.699
and a lot
more goodies, besides.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.659
- And you're not grabbing these
goodies for yourself, why?

17:31.702 --> 17:33.835
- Mate, if I knew
how to rob that place

17:33.878 --> 17:36.533
without getting decapitated,
I'd be robbing it right now.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.277
- You have all come to hear

17:41.321 --> 17:43.149
the story of
the Great Unshackling.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.848
First, there was I,
Ember, God of Fillory.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.155
Then came my boring
brother, Umber.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.288
Together we created this world.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.771
[crowd exclaims]

17:58.207 --> 18:00.688
But I thought it would
be funny if Fillory

18:00.731 --> 18:02.646
were ruled by
Children of Earth.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.648
- I am High King Eliot,

18:04.692 --> 18:07.173
and I am drunk all the time.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.739
[laughter]
- That's original.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.741
- I am High King Margo,

18:10.785 --> 18:13.004
and I'm angry all the time.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.919
[laughter]
- I am King Quentin,

18:14.963 --> 18:17.618
and I am dissatisfied
all the time.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.359
- I am Queen Alice,

18:19.402 --> 18:21.317
and I died,

18:21.361 --> 18:22.884
sort of.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.712
It's complicated.
[laughter]

18:24.755 --> 18:26.714
- The Children of Earth
came and went doing

18:26.757 --> 18:28.194
their Children of Earth things,

18:28.237 --> 18:31.153
like chewing loudly
and texting.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.199
One of them even killed me,

18:33.242 --> 18:35.157
which was not funny,

18:35.201 --> 18:37.855
but at least it was unexpected.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.857
[crowd boos]

18:39.901 --> 18:42.077
- He neglected to mention he
was gonna destroy the world.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.165
- True that.
- Shh!

18:43.209 --> 18:45.124
- No matter who was in charge,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.387
Fillory remained
shackled to them,

18:47.430 --> 18:49.171
which brings us to...

18:49.215 --> 18:50.259
these two.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.178
- I am High King Fen
the Toeless,

18:56.222 --> 18:57.919
and I like knives.

18:57.962 --> 19:01.096
- I am Josh the Fresh Prince,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.664
and I love to eat.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.753
Also I have a mustache.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.276
- Huh.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.843
I guess Josh must've
gone through a mustache phase.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.932
- So they weren't paying
attention

19:10.975 --> 19:12.194
when it happened.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.675
The Takers came into Fillory.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.155
the borderlands
became overrun.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.940
The people fled
for their lives.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.420
Boo!
[crowd boos]

19:20.463 --> 19:22.117
- Boo.
[booing continues]

19:22.161 --> 19:24.075
What's a Taker?
- I don't know.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.773
- No one knows where
the Takers came from,

19:25.816 --> 19:26.904
but they were everywhere.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.732
The people asked for help.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.212
both:
But we didn't do anything.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.648
- The people prayed.

19:31.692 --> 19:32.997
There were no more
gods in Fillory,

19:33.041 --> 19:34.347
yet their prayers
were answered anyway.

19:34.390 --> 19:38.089
- I will save
the people of Fillory!

19:40.831 --> 19:43.007
- Who was this mysterious hero?

19:43.051 --> 19:44.270
- Oh, just a humble wizard

19:44.313 --> 19:46.446
coming to you
out of the darkness.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.188
- Eventually,
the people would decide

19:49.231 --> 19:53.148
to make this dark wizard
their king: the Dark King.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.979
- I promise to protect you
as long as I live,

19:58.022 --> 19:59.720
and I shall live forever.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.678
- But before this could happen,

20:01.722 --> 20:04.768
the people handed out
just desserts!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.423
- To the gallows!

20:07.467 --> 20:10.687
[crowd cheering]

20:12.994 --> 20:14.865
- Did somebody say "dessert"?

20:15.866 --> 20:18.869
[cheering]

20:24.179 --> 20:27.226
- As we cast off
the shackles of our past,

20:27.269 --> 20:31.273
I declare today will be known
hence as the Great Unshackling.

20:31.317 --> 20:35.495
- And the people of Fillory
lived happily ever after.

20:35.538 --> 20:38.846
[cheers and applause]

20:47.289 --> 20:48.290
- Margo, for God's sake,

20:48.334 --> 20:49.378
would you just come back?

20:49.422 --> 20:50.945
- They murdered them!

20:50.988 --> 20:52.120
They murdered
the shit out of them.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.339
- Okay, yeah, like

20:53.382 --> 20:55.515
300 years ago, all right?

20:55.558 --> 20:58.909
Look, maybe you didn't
have time to prepare yourself

20:58.953 --> 21:02.086
for this, but you have to know
it didn't end well for them.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.741
- Yeah, well,
it's not over yet.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.440
We're gonna
"Endgame" this shit.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.051
- When did you have time
to go see "Endgame"?

21:10.094 --> 21:11.313
- Does it matter?

21:11.357 --> 21:12.488
All I'm saying is

21:12.532 --> 21:13.881
we're gonna
time-fix this bitch.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.274
In the center of Fillory

21:15.317 --> 21:17.276
is a clockwork heart
built by dwarves.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.191
They're the ones
who taught Jane Chatwin

21:20.235 --> 21:21.889
how to do Time Magic.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.369
Jesus Helena Bonham Christ.

21:23.412 --> 21:24.892
Read the books already, El.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.373
We're gonna dial back the clock

21:27.416 --> 21:29.984
300 years to before
all this bullshit.

21:31.507 --> 21:34.467
- Right, so I guess we just
have to somehow find our way

21:34.510 --> 21:36.817
to the center
of the world, then?

21:37.861 --> 21:39.167
- When I was High King,

21:39.210 --> 21:41.343
I started
excavations to reach it.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.998
I wanted to meet
the Clock Dwarf.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.131
Who takes care
of the clockwork heart?

21:47.175 --> 21:49.917
Come on.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.208

going to slide

it's been 300 years.

24:44.657 --> 24:49.096
- Big ol' surge of magic
skipped the gears forward.

24:49.139 --> 24:52.273
I had to crank down on it
before it went too far.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.319
- Okay, how about you just
wind it back 300 years, then?

24:55.363 --> 24:56.756

- Well why would you wanna
go 300 years in the past?

dead and the world is ------.

some way to skip back.

about the snacks.

it would just be bad.

a lot to upset me.

closest friends died.

anything from in there.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.005

changes a goddamn thing.

thought you would be grateful.

out there, but with me?

least try to be real.

alone to calm down.

the location of every volume

28:43.504 --> 28:45.419

28:46.463 --> 28:48.901
- So what's the problem, then?

I need you to unlock it.

29:00.390 --> 29:03.829

I'll need a drink.

if I didn't talk to them,

29:20.106 --> 29:22.456

how not to get killed.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.067
- Well, how very
thoughtful of you.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.156

I was doing you a solid,

I'm your guy.

anecdote to win you back.

I've stopped drinking,

Yes.
