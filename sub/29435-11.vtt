WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:11.359
I heard Interpol arrested
the last of Sahar's

00:11.402 --> 00:13.622
splinter group. Her
organization destroyed.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.189
Phineas's mom?What did he do now?

00:15.232 --> 00:17.887
Phineas introduced himself
to me this morning.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.194
Phineas doesn't know about my
custody battle with his father.

00:20.237 --> 00:23.240
[grunts]Who is Sahar? Where is she?

00:23.284 --> 00:24.720
She goes by Sarah.
She's got a kid.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.200
What's the kid's name?[grunts]

00:26.243 --> 00:27.418
Phineas.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.550
McGEE: We think she moved in next door

00:28.593 --> 00:31.857
to lie in wait
for Ziva to come back.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.642
Phineas was used
to get close to you.

00:33.685 --> 00:37.211
If something happens to her,
I'll be alone.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.955
PHINEAS:
Jethro Gibbs?

00:42.999 --> 00:45.001
Are you there?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.667
[crying]: Promise me
you won't let her get hurt.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.974
[gunshot]

01:02.018 --> 01:04.325
[phone ringing]

01:13.334 --> 01:15.292
Ziver.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.555
Did I wake you?

01:17.599 --> 01:19.296
No.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.081
Did you tell him?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.865
[sighs]
Yeah.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.562
Is he all right?

01:24.606 --> 01:25.955
No.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.218
[exhales]
Let me come over.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.785
Perhaps I could be

01:29.828 --> 01:31.221
of some help with...No.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.267
No, we're good.Are you sure?

01:33.310 --> 01:37.053
I could bring...Ziva, go to Paris.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.316
See your family.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.492
You've waited long enough.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.626
Gibbs.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.585
I don't know what to say.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.326
Nothing to say.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.024
It's okay, really.

01:54.331 --> 01:57.291
[phone beeping]

01:57.334 --> 02:00.381
Hey, uh,
got another call coming in.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.425
No, wait. Gibbs, uh,

02:01.469 --> 02:03.297
listen to me. I-I...I got to go.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.561
Take care of yourself.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.476
Gibbs. No, no, no, wait.
Wait, I just...

02:11.131 --> 02:13.350
Gibbs.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.875
Jack.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.312
Hey. I wake you?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.096
No.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.445
I haven't been able
to go back to sleep

02:21.489 --> 02:23.360
since you called last night.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.275
Let me come over.

02:25.319 --> 02:28.017
Uh, no. No.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.150
I'm good.No, you're not.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.108
And Phin's not.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.632
He'll need psychological care,
Gibbs.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.766
[sighs]
All right, fine.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.290
Come on over.
Gonna check on him anyway.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.336
[knock on door]

02:44.164 --> 02:46.166
[door opens, closes]

02:48.820 --> 02:50.474
Did you get caught
in traffic?I told you

02:50.518 --> 02:52.302
I couldn't sleep.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.304
You want me to go up with you?

02:54.348 --> 02:56.393
No. No, I do not.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.526
Make yourself some coffee.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.485
I got this.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.533
[knock on door]

03:05.576 --> 03:06.882
Hey, Phin?

03:15.064 --> 03:17.414
Phineas?He's got to be here
somewhere. Phineas!

03:17.458 --> 03:19.721
Hey, Phineas!

03:21.766 --> 03:24.421
I don't see his backpack.
He dumped his books.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.685
He took clothes.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.296
SLOANE:
And however much was in here.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.779
Hey.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.435
Okay. Let's not panic.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.828
He can't have got far on foot.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.133
I'll call...I'll call 911.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.135
I'm calling McGee.Local PD can start searching

03:43.179 --> 03:45.268
a lot faster than we could.So what, Jack?

03:45.312 --> 03:47.270
So call 911. Call everybody.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.925
We need everybody.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.970
â™ª

04:22.479 --> 04:23.654
SLOANE:
You watch.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.003
He's gonna turn up any second.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.570
He can't get far on foot.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.356
That's the tenth time
you've said that.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.401
Well, it bears repeating.
Just like this park.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.621
This is the third time
we've driven past it.We used to play

04:33.664 --> 04:34.970
catch here all the time.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.580
Did Phin say anything last night

04:36.624 --> 04:39.104
that might have suggested
where he would go?

04:39.148 --> 04:40.584
Nothing.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.326
Nothing obvious, maybe,
but think. Gibbs.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.285
How did he react
when you told him about his mom?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.808
How do you think he reacted,
Jack?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.810
I don't know.
You tell me. Did he cry?

04:48.853 --> 04:50.986
Well, hell yes, he cried.Okay, and then what?

04:51.029 --> 04:53.641
He... Like, denial? Anger?

04:54.685 --> 04:56.208
After he cried,

04:56.252 --> 04:58.036
what happened then, Gibbs?

04:59.081 --> 05:02.258
He got scared, okay?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.480
Why do bad things
always happen?

05:06.523 --> 05:08.482
They don't, Phin.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.353
Yeah, they do.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.703
My aunt not
wanting me anymore.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.357
Your aunt?I used to live

05:14.401 --> 05:17.012
with her and my uncle
when I was little.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.494
What about your dad?

05:20.537 --> 05:22.496
Did he kill my mom?

05:22.539 --> 05:24.193
No.To get to me?

05:24.236 --> 05:25.542
No, he did not.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.196
Mom says he's crazy.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.938
Do I have to go live
with my dad now?

05:29.981 --> 05:32.767
Not gonna happen.How do you know?

05:32.810 --> 05:35.204
How did my mom die?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.644
Oh, Gibbs, I'm so sorry.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.344
What happened then?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.911
He kicked me out.

05:46.955 --> 05:50.175
He said he needed some space,
some time alone,

05:50.219 --> 05:52.569
so I gave it to him.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.267
And now he's gone.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.966
[phone rings]

05:58.009 --> 06:00.011
Yeah, go, McGee.
You got both of us.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.926
We're still at the house.
We got a BOLO out

06:01.970 --> 06:04.015
to every local agency,
complete with photo.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.191
Yeah. What we need
are more details.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.671
Like, what was he wearing?

06:07.715 --> 06:08.933
Mm-hmm.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.935
Gibbs, his clothes?

06:10.979 --> 06:12.937
Jack, how the hell do I know?

06:12.981 --> 06:15.505
Last night, it was pajamas.Hey.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.290
They're just trying to get
more information, okay?

06:18.334 --> 06:20.684
Boss, his backpack. Do you
remember what color it is?

06:20.728 --> 06:22.817
Uh... blue.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.514
No.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.647
Purple, maybe.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.258
I-I don't know. I-I don't...

06:29.301 --> 06:30.390
I'm sorry. I don't know.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.043
Hey, hey,
is-is Torres over there?

06:32.087 --> 06:33.262
McGEE:
No. He, uh,

06:33.305 --> 06:34.350
he couldn't bear to stay.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.699
He went out searching
on his own.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.657
He's got a thing
about lost kids.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.659
Yeah, don't we all.

06:38.702 --> 06:41.052
BISHOP: So, obviously,
no sign of him, huh?

06:41.096 --> 06:43.315
No, not yet. We're driving past

06:43.359 --> 06:45.622
all the places that Phin went
with Gibbs.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.842
The-the playground,
the softball field,

06:47.885 --> 06:48.973
the ice cream shop.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.845
Uh, school's opening soon,
so we're gonna

06:50.888 --> 06:53.543
head over...I-I-Ice cream shop.
I dropped him off

06:53.587 --> 06:54.849
at a friend's house nearby.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.678
Friend's name was
Harry. Harry or, uh...

06:57.721 --> 06:59.810
Herbie.[tires squealing]

07:05.120 --> 07:06.600
Can we help you?

07:06.643 --> 07:08.689
Hey, you're Harry, right?

07:08.732 --> 07:11.605
Hurley. You're Phin's friend?

07:11.648 --> 07:13.824
NCIS. Special Agent Sloane.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.609
Jethro Gibbs. Phin's friend.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.610
You know where he is?

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
Who? Phineas?

07:18.525 --> 07:20.309
Why? What happened?

07:20.352 --> 07:21.832
At the moment,
he's missing, ma'am.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.834
That's terrible. Is Sarah okay?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.663
Oh, no.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.056
What is it?

07:28.099 --> 07:30.058
She didn't hit him, did she?

07:30.101 --> 07:31.668
What would make you say that?

07:31.712 --> 07:33.322
I don't know.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.672
I-I hate to gossip.

07:35.716 --> 07:36.630
But?But...

07:36.673 --> 07:38.501
something's just
off with her.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.808
She's moody, distracted,
barely nice enough.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.767
Never comes to PTA. Always
somewhere more important to be.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.814
Hey, Hurley, honey?

07:46.857 --> 07:48.337
You sure you don't know
where he is?

07:48.380 --> 07:52.210
Uh, i-is Phin's mom really dead?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.822
What? What?Where'd you hear that?

07:54.865 --> 07:56.650
I promised I wouldn't tell.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.652
Yeah, but, um, Hurley,

07:58.695 --> 08:00.610
we need to find him
so we can help him.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.655
You understand that?

08:01.698 --> 08:03.657
[exhales]

08:03.700 --> 08:06.616
Phin woke me up this morning
wanting to buy my bike.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.358
He's on a bike?I offered to lend it to him,

08:09.401 --> 08:12.361
but he was afraid he wouldn't
be able to bring it back,

08:12.404 --> 08:15.016
so he wanted to
give me the $14

08:15.059 --> 08:16.539
he'd saved up.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.759
Wait, is Sarah r-really...?

08:18.802 --> 08:21.805
I'm afraid so, ma'am.So I gave Phin my bike.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.111
And don't get mad at me, Mom.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.591
I felt sorry for him.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.722
GIBBS:
When was this?

08:25.766 --> 08:27.332
Where was he going?He didn't say.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.726
I'm sorry. It was real early.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.336
Still dark out.He's on a bike.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.729
Which can take him a long way.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.775
Thank you.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.350
Talk to me.BOLO's been updated

08:45.394 --> 08:47.570
to include an orange
and yellow mountain bike.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.572
Try pinging
his cell phone again.I did.

08:49.616 --> 08:50.834
Been trying every ten minutes.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.619
It's likely
that Phin took out the SIM card.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.578
Guess he learned a few things
during his visit here.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.668
Okay, Amber Alert's
updated, too.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.974
The police have
checkpoints all over.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.366
There's no way we
won't find him.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.586
Unless he's in hiding
or he's being held someplace.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.633
Okay, but let's not jump to
worst-case scenarios just yet.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.244
Why not? It doesn't get
much worse than this.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.551
He's nine years old.
He's out there on his own.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.465
Even without some
crazy-ass father

09:13.509 --> 09:14.902
we know nothing about!McGEE:
Boss,

09:14.945 --> 09:16.904
given what we now know
about Sahar,

09:16.947 --> 09:18.732
Phin's dad may not
be crazy at all.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.604
Find his dad!

09:22.866 --> 09:24.912
Now!

09:25.956 --> 09:27.654
[exhales]

09:27.697 --> 09:29.569
I have never

09:29.612 --> 09:31.701
seen him this bad.I'm sure few have.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.746
He's pushing us away.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.096
Hurting in such
a big way right now.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.315
But he had no choice
in killing Sahar.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.187
He knows that, right?Yes,

09:39.230 --> 09:40.536
but he also knows that he left

09:40.580 --> 09:43.495
a boy he cares a lot about
without a mom.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.193
It's not his fault.
She used her own son as cover.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.716
None of which
matters to him.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.761
He's beating himself up,

09:47.804 --> 09:49.327
and if anything happens
to this kid,

09:49.371 --> 09:50.807
it's just gonna get worse.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.910
[indistinct chatter]

10:09.434 --> 10:11.175
JIMMY:
Agent Gibbs.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.178
I, uh...

10:14.222 --> 10:16.180
You're back.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.661
We heard about...

10:18.705 --> 10:21.533
Uh, are you okay?

10:21.577 --> 10:24.711
JIMMY:
As you can see,
I haven't started yet.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.235
Virginia State Police only
just gave us jurisdiction

10:27.278 --> 10:30.151
a couple hours ago, so...You can skip cause of death.
I know what killed her.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.108
JIMMY:
Right.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.633
Copy that.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.330
I'm sure there's plenty more
her body can tell us.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.810
[quietly]:
There's got to be.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.944
We need something to tell us
where Phineas went.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.946
Anything?

10:42.990 --> 10:46.341
Gibbs, if it's there,
we'll find it.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.647
We promise.

10:47.690 --> 10:48.735
Where to, Gibbs?Where's Victor?

10:48.778 --> 10:50.040
We cut him loose yet?

10:50.084 --> 10:51.607
The club owner? Yeah, we had to.
He lawyered up.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.261
He's the only one who knows
anything at all about Sahar.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.611
Let's go pay him a visit.I'll go. You stay here.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.353
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?Hey, the team needs you.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.182
I'm better off alone.No, no, no, you're not.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.793
Hey, Torres!Gibbs, don't give me
this lone wolf stuff.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.012
All right?
Nobody's better off alone.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.622
If there's a kid out there,

11:06.666 --> 11:08.755
you either take me along,
or you fire my ass right now.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.063
Come on.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.633
Damn!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.548
Double damn!

11:20.810 --> 11:22.159
Ah, what the hell?
You again? Joe!

11:22.203 --> 11:23.900
[grunting]Oh, all right. Slow down.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.120
Slow down! Not the nose!
[choking]

11:26.163 --> 11:28.339
Sahar. What else do you know?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.733
[choking, wheezing]

11:30.777 --> 11:32.126
Nick.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.475
[gasps, pants]

11:33.518 --> 11:35.477
Look, I already
told you all I know.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.306
Where is the kid?Ah. It's not my turn to watch
him. Go ask his mother.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.700
She's dead. You
want to join her?

11:40.743 --> 11:42.527
What? S-Sahar is dead?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.486
That's big news.
I-I didn't know.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.793
And I sure don't know
where the kid is.What about the dad?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.055
What about him?
I don't know him.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.709
[straining]:
All right, look.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.232
I know that I lied
to you guys before, but...

11:51.275 --> 11:52.755
Yeah, you've lied
quite a few times.[phone rings]

11:52.799 --> 11:54.888
But I'm being honest.Yeah, Bishop.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.890
[Victor choking]Uh... hey.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.066
I don't know anything else
about Sahar!

11:59.109 --> 12:01.285
[choking continues]Is that Victor?

12:01.329 --> 12:02.722
Apple Pie says "hi."

12:02.765 --> 12:04.767
[sighs]What do you know?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.290
Pedestrian reported seeing a kid

12:06.334 --> 12:08.728
on an orange and yellow
mountain bike,

12:08.771 --> 12:10.817
corner of Maple Street
and Tenth.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.602
We'll alert Maryland
State Police and, uh...

12:13.645 --> 12:14.690
Maple and Tenth. Let's go.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.039
Uh... hello?

12:16.083 --> 12:17.867
Saved by the bell, Victor.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.827
[gasps]

12:20.870 --> 12:22.089
[coughing]Oh, yeah.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.655
A lot of good you are.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.875
That sounded perfectly legal.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.095
What sounded perfectly legal?Nothing. Uh, anything
new on Sahar?

12:28.138 --> 12:29.792
Just background stuff.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.098
Born in Palestine
to British parents,

12:31.141 --> 12:34.884
educated in London,
radicalized post-9/11.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.538
What about Phin's dad?Mm-mm.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.497
Still nothing. No record of any
custody battle involving Sahar.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.848
She lied about everything else,
so why not that?

12:41.891 --> 12:44.676
I'm thinking more and more,
Phin might not even be her kid.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.809
Nothing from the P.O.W. camp?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.898
All I've confirmed is that
Sahar spent 11 years there.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.770
And just one month
after she escaped,

12:50.813 --> 12:52.641
Eli David's farmhouse
was blown up.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.730
But Sahar clearly knew
Ziva survived the blast,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.863
or none of this would be
happening now.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.212
Excuse me.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.691
Uh, where are
you going, Jack?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.345
We need more.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.130
Someone to fill in the blanks
on Sahar's prison time.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.131
You know someone?

13:04.174 --> 13:06.263
Uh, Vance might know.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.837
I managed to scare off
a few delivery guys,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.447
but no orange and yellow bike.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.972
All right.
Let's keep circling.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.365
Man, I still can't believe
how this woman got us.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.846
How she fooled us, man.
I should have seen it.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.979
Ishould have.Oh, come on, man.
Not just you.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.242
She used her
own kid as cover.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.592
That's not even fair.There.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.028
No. "Fair." Not even fair.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.378
No. There. There!
On the bike.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.958
[grunts]

13:51.961 --> 13:54.964
[guttural gasping]

13:55.008 --> 13:56.966
Mind if I join you?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.283
This is Hurley's bike.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.589
But not Phin's backpack.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.852
Let me guess.
You're a doctor?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.288
Those ain't mine, man.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.551
I found that backpack
in a dumpster.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.466
Come on.[groans]

14:18.509 --> 14:20.511
[grunts]A few things I miss
about police work.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.470
Dealing with idiots
like you is not one of them.

14:22.513 --> 14:25.255
Where'd you get the bike?Don't say you found it, either.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.648
No. That I actually bought.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.692
Just a little while ago,
some kid.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.651
What kid? Where's the kid?!

14:29.694 --> 14:31.392
Bus station
on Willow!

14:31.435 --> 14:32.610
He was maybe nine, ten.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.177
Said he needed money
for a bus ticket,

14:34.221 --> 14:35.657
so I gave him 20 bucks
for the bike.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.311
Give this clown to the cops.
Meet you at the bus station.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.443
And I'll beat you there.I'm riding with you.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.706
No, you're not. I got
all the help I need.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.143
I'm not asking.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.971
Do you really want to spend
time arguing about this?

14:45.014 --> 14:47.321
Hey, don't! Just take her!

14:50.106 --> 14:51.934
So much for Paris.I called McGee

14:51.978 --> 14:55.155
to say goodbye and, uh, he
told me where to find you.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.723
I know how much this
boy means to you, Gibbs.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.336
Paris can wait.

15:04.816 --> 15:08.168
Okay. Thanks, Nick.
Keep us posted. So,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.953
they found the bike,
but no Phineas.Why? What happened?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.173
Well, he didn't say, but they're
chasing another lead now,

15:13.216 --> 15:15.697
along with Ziva.I told her
Gibbs didn't want company.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.787
Yeah, like she'd listen?In that case, maybe we should
all be out there searching.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.181
We've already got every possible
agency with the exception

15:21.224 --> 15:24.184
of the-the Boy Scouts of America
out looking for this kid.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.360
Was Vance not helpful, Jack?No, no, he was.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.362
His contact in Damascus
confirmed

15:28.405 --> 15:30.842
that Sahar did give birth
in prison,

15:30.886 --> 15:33.062
but the baby was sent
to an orphanage in Aleppo.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.021
And no mention of paternity?Not a word.

15:35.064 --> 15:38.198
And none of which
helps us find Phineas.Maybe not, but this might.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.895
What do you got, Kase?A pendant Sahar was wearing.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.898
I thought it was just jewelry.
Looks innocent enough.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.379
Not so innocent?Not when I cracked it open.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.947
It's a GPS receiver.
Nothing fancy.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.036
Like the kind that finds my
keys when I lose them every day.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.820
I can't imagine
Sahar knew about it.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.865
She, of all people,
would never want to be tracked.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.737
And-and it wasn't just her.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.740
This design. This is two pieces
of a friendship pendant, right?

15:58.783 --> 16:00.437
Exactly. There's another half
to that heart,

16:00.481 --> 16:02.265
and someone else is
out there wearing it.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.093
Like the father?Or Phineas?

16:04.137 --> 16:06.095
Any chance we can
reverse engineer it,

16:06.139 --> 16:08.097
find out who's
doing the tracking?

16:08.141 --> 16:09.490
Mm, that's a long shot.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.361
Maybe, but I'm working on it.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.019
WOMAN:
Sure, I saw him.
Cute kid.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.542
Wanted a ticket to Philly.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.196
Of course,
I couldn't sell it to him.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.938
Why not?No unaccompanied minors.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.201
I think he said something
about his aunt meeting him here,

16:25.245 --> 16:27.073
so I told him
to come back when she does.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.163
Is he still here?MAN: No!

16:30.206 --> 16:32.861
You got it all wrong, Maureen.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.210
Lenny, stay out of this, please.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.256
Yeah, but that's not
what the kid said.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.606
You're talking about that kid
that sold his bike, right?

16:38.649 --> 16:41.348
Keep talking.Yeah, him. He said

16:41.391 --> 16:45.091
he was going to visit
his aunt inPhiladelphia.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.789
When Maureen said no,

16:47.832 --> 16:51.619
he gave money to some hippie
girl to buy his ticket for him.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.187
I'm pretty sure
they got on the same bus.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.972
Where's the bus to Philly now?Left about 20 minutes
ago, and it's a local.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.757
Should be pulling into
Silver Spring pretty soon.20 minutes.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.282
15 on my bike.Call Silver Spring,
tell 'em to hold the bus.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.761
Got a runaway on board.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.937
Oh. Oh, my.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.116
NowI'll stay out of this.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.556
[sighs]

17:15.599 --> 17:17.253
It's gonna be all right, Gibbs.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.300
The boy and the bus will be
waiting when we get there.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.041
You'll see.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.567
Come on. Talk to me.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.090
I hope

17:28.134 --> 17:29.918
you're not blaming yourself
for any of this.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.311
Yeah? Who else you got?

17:31.354 --> 17:33.530
Me. I brought this upon you.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.271
And for that, I'm sorry.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.186
That's me.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.709
Me. I'm sorry.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.410
Sorry I didn't see
what was right in front of me.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.240
Sorry I brought this kid
even into my...

17:47.283 --> 17:48.676
That you ever let him
into your heart?

17:48.719 --> 17:49.981
Is that what you're gonna say?

17:51.374 --> 17:52.767
We have suffered

17:52.810 --> 17:55.161
more broken hearts
than most, Gibbs.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.988
Enough to make us afraid

17:57.032 --> 17:58.816
to ever open them again.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.863
[sighs]

18:07.216 --> 18:08.348
[tires screech]

18:14.919 --> 18:16.921
Phineas?!NCIS.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.184
Yeah, yeah,
I just got your text.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.576
It's not like I take calls
while I drive.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.100
Whose kid are you looking for?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.014
Phineas?! Have you
seen this kid before?

18:23.058 --> 18:25.191
Have you seen this kid?
Hey, have you seen this kid?

18:25.234 --> 18:27.367
Oh, hey, you mean Phin?You've seen him?

18:27.410 --> 18:29.630
Yeah. I bought him a ticket
to see his aunt.

18:29.673 --> 18:32.154
Cool kid.
Doesn't say much.Which way did he go?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.852
He went to get a soda.
He'll be back.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.509
What is it?Block the back exits.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.339
Phineas!

18:43.383 --> 18:45.428
Who is it you're looking for?

18:45.472 --> 18:47.648
The kid who just
got off that bus.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.823
We didn't see him, Gibbs.

18:48.866 --> 18:49.954
Well, yeah, he was here.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.478
I saw him leaving
a minute ago.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.697
He left?With his ride.

18:53.741 --> 18:57.310
They drove off in a van.
I assumed it was his father.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.450
KASIE:
As you can see, the bus station
surveillance system was

19:07.494 --> 19:09.322
state of the art
when disco was king.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.063
No, I need a clearer picture
of his face,

19:12.107 --> 19:14.501
or the van's license plate,
or both.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.981
Given the resolution,
I can try...Kasie, get it done.

19:17.025 --> 19:20.507
Uh, hey, Gibbs.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.683
Did Kasie show you the pendant?

19:22.726 --> 19:23.640
It's a GPS tracker
Sahar was wearing.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.686
Does it look familiar?
No.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.644
Should it? Who-who
was tracking her?

19:27.688 --> 19:29.777
Still working on that.There'd likely be

19:29.820 --> 19:32.736
another half of this heart
out there somewhere.
Maybe on Phineas?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.651
Well, if so, it may explain
how this creep got to him

19:34.695 --> 19:37.654
before you did-- we.
Before wedid.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.742
No, you had it right
the first time.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.570
I want to know
if that creep

19:40.614 --> 19:42.659
is Phineas's father or not.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.749
Hey, let's check with the team,
let Kasie get back to work.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.579
SLOANE:
Thanks, Kasie.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.712
It'll all work out, Gibbs.
I promise.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.591
Huh.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.984
So, how are you?

20:03.027 --> 20:05.247
You okay?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.031
Stop asking me that.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.207
No.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.686
No?
No!

20:09.730 --> 20:14.256
No. I've got you and Kasie
and Ziva and everybody else

20:14.300 --> 20:16.606
worrying about me,
asking how I am.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.086
Forget me.

20:18.129 --> 20:21.002
Nobody ask me about me
until we find that kid.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.090
You got that?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.048
Hey, I get

20:24.092 --> 20:25.615
that you're upset...Turn that back on.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.269
...but you need to stop
snapping at people.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.923
You-you turn that back on.No.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.316
We're all just trying
to help you,

20:30.359 --> 20:32.709
and you're not letting us.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.538
Hey, look at me.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.105
Take a deep breath. Okay?

20:37.148 --> 20:39.281
In through your nose.
[inhales deeply]

20:39.325 --> 20:40.282
Out through your mouth.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.936
I'll breath later.Right.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.154
After we find the kid. Got it.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.634
Come on.
[inhales]

20:47.594 --> 20:49.683
[exhales]

20:49.726 --> 20:51.424
"We'll see."

20:51.467 --> 20:53.164
What's that?Nothin'.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.688
Not nothing.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.298
You said, "We'll see."

20:56.342 --> 20:59.127
It's the last thing
I said to Phineas, Jack.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.303
Do you know
what happened?

21:02.783 --> 21:06.134
Your mom got too
close to bad people.

21:06.177 --> 21:09.224
Someday you'll understand that
better than you do now.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.573
So what, then?

21:10.617 --> 21:12.575
What's gonna happen to me?

21:12.619 --> 21:14.229
Where will Igo?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.839
You don't have to worry
about that now.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.145
But I have to.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.321
Phineas?With my aunt?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.888
Phineas...My dad? Where?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.806
Can I stay with you?

21:27.808 --> 21:29.810
We'll see.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.465
"We'll see"?

21:32.508 --> 21:36.120
When my mom says that,
it always means no.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.385
All I had to do was say yes,

21:39.428 --> 21:40.734
he'd still be here.Of course

21:40.777 --> 21:42.605
you couldn't say that.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.868
I just killed his mom!And the last thing
that he needed

21:44.912 --> 21:47.610
was you to make a promise
that you couldn't keep.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.309
Yeah, maybe.No. I know.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.615
I also know you need
to let yourself off the hook.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.619
[softly]:
Hey. Come here.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.665
Come here.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.324
After we find Phineas.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.195
[takes deep breath]And we will.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.544
Miracles happen.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.590
Ha. Not lately.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.344
Wish she could have
given us more.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.650
This woman could
only take.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.741
I haven't seen Gibbs
this shaken up since...

22:31.785 --> 22:33.743
well, since youdied,
frankly.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.354
Or pretended to.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.746
He put on a brave front,

22:36.790 --> 22:39.488
but... it crushed him.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.577
Crushed us all.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.971
I feel like
I'm apologizing a lot today.

22:44.014 --> 22:45.407
That's not why
I'm telling you that.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.930
If anything,
I'm just happy to have you

22:46.974 --> 22:50.325
back among the living,
finally get a fresh start.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.155
I cannot help to wonder if
the living will have me back.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.678
Or if...

22:55.722 --> 22:58.028
Tali will even recognize me.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.422
What? Of course she will.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.164
Ziva, Tony would never
let her forget you.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.646
I texted Tony
after Sahar was killed.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.605
To let him know
that they were safe.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.694
And, uh...

23:11.738 --> 23:13.783
still no response.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.611
I hate that.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.266
If Breena doesn't return
my text right away,

23:18.309 --> 23:21.617
I immediately picture her
trapped under a pile of rubble,

23:21.661 --> 23:24.707
her cell phone
just barely out of reach...

23:24.751 --> 23:27.928
Wh-Which is not at all
like your situation,

23:27.971 --> 23:29.538
but we...[phone ringing]

23:29.582 --> 23:31.497
Oop. Speak of the devil.

23:34.587 --> 23:37.024
Oh, it's not Breena.
It's Torres.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.852
He wants
another update.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.463
Still out there,
looking for that van.He does seem

23:41.507 --> 23:43.073
rather obsessed.Yeah.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.901
I am not surprised.

23:51.691 --> 23:54.476
Nick broke up
a child trafficking ring.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.697
This is years ago,
he was still undercover.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.744
But it really
messed with his head.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.137
That would explain it.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.661
Yeah, he doesn't like
to talk about it.

24:09.012 --> 24:09.926
What?

24:09.970 --> 24:12.929
[chuckles]

24:12.973 --> 24:15.976
You are still everyone's
favorite confidant.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.805
Oh... [laughs]
I don't know about that.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.676
I mean, if I am,
I'm not a very good one.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.983
I mean, I just told you.And I will say nothing.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.072
Because you, Jimmy,
are a great

24:25.115 --> 24:27.161
and loyal secret keeper.

24:27.204 --> 24:28.858
And a true friend.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.514
Not the right time. Please.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.649
[both laughing]

24:40.000 --> 24:42.306
Look, we are just
as frustrated, Gibbs.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.656
I mean, whoever
Phin's father is,

24:43.699 --> 24:44.787
he must be off
the grid completely.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.573
So, all of those
custody battles...

24:47.616 --> 24:49.488
Were likely an excuse
to search for Ziva

24:49.531 --> 24:51.011
and do other bad things.

24:51.054 --> 24:55.015
This aunt Phin told
everybody about, from Philly.

24:55.058 --> 24:55.842
He also mentioned an uncle.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.191
We found no living aunt.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.801
But we can search for an uncle.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.020
There has to be a connection.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.935
Welcome back, Gibbs.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.502
How are you?
You doing okay?

25:04.938 --> 25:07.506
Hey, Leon, any more word
from Damascus?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.029
That's why I'm here.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.422
My contact found a worker
at the American embassy there

25:11.466 --> 25:12.989
who just might have
a story to tell.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.383
Jack, Gibbs, MTAC.
Let's go.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.906
Before we speak,
I must be assured

25:16.950 --> 25:18.995
that Sahar is absolutely dead.

25:19.039 --> 25:19.996
Well, we can't
drag her body up here,

25:20.040 --> 25:21.520
but we can
send you pictures.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.130
She's no one to joke about, sir.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.828
Yeah, we know.
How'd you know her?

25:25.872 --> 25:27.700
I once worked at a P.O.W. camp,

25:27.743 --> 25:30.006
where I observed her
from a safe distance.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.442
Then you know
she had a child.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.140
Any idea who the father is?

25:33.183 --> 25:34.968
That would be Ahmet,
the lead guard.

25:35.011 --> 25:38.711
They had an arrangement
until Sahar became pregnant.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.451
She thought bearing his child,
little Fahim,

25:40.495 --> 25:42.062
would gain her privileges.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.890
But instead, little Fahim was
sent to an orphanage, correct?

25:43.933 --> 25:46.980
Yes. This part you know.Yes. That had to hurt.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.459
So severely that when she
escaped years later,

25:48.503 --> 25:49.939
she stabbed Ahmet
through the heart.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.593
Many times.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.855
And the baby?

25:52.899 --> 25:54.248
I only know rumors.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.032
Missionaries took many children
from the orphanage

25:56.076 --> 25:57.773
as the war intensified.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.079
They say Fahim ended up

25:59.122 --> 26:00.384
in the American
foster care system,

26:00.428 --> 26:01.777
and that is where Sahar went
to find him.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.866
So, Fahim became Phineas,

26:03.910 --> 26:05.868
and this aunt must be
a foster parent.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.305
I still have some contacts
at the adoption agency.

26:08.349 --> 26:11.047
Maybe they can help us
locate the foster family.Yeah. Go, go.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.571
So, where'd you pick up
these rumors?

26:12.614 --> 26:13.920
Perhaps I've said too much.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.444
Why? Who are you
afraid of now?

26:16.487 --> 26:17.706
[door closes]

26:17.750 --> 26:19.665
Ahmet has a brother.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.884
A Libyan gangster
named Hassan Sayegh.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.930
He put up a bounty years ago.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.932
$1 million American
on the head of Sahar

26:25.975 --> 26:27.455
and the return of his nephew.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.892
If he's behind Sahar's death,

26:29.936 --> 26:32.373
then perhaps he already
has the boy?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.550
GIBBS:
Hey, McGee.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.639
I got a new name for you.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.945
All right, fire away.
What do you got?

26:38.988 --> 26:41.077
First name is Hassan.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.949
Last name is Sayegh.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.777
Hassan Sayegh.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.082
Libyan gangster?

26:46.126 --> 26:47.606
Ziva, hey, you know him?I know ofhim.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.130
Many people do,
and not for good reason.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.914
BISHOP:
Uh, Gibbs,
what about him?

26:51.958 --> 26:52.959
GIBBS:
He may be the one
who's after Phineas.

26:53.002 --> 26:56.005
I got it!
The bus station video.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.311
I couldn't get
the license plate,

26:57.354 --> 26:59.922
but I got a clear shot
of the guy,

26:59.966 --> 27:02.272
and facial recognition
gave us a name.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.709
BISHOP:
Victor, the club owner?

27:05.101 --> 27:06.668
Ziva, let's go.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.670
Uh, yeah, Gibbs,
I'm coming, too.No, you're not.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.193
You're staying here.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.979
You get Victor's photo to TSA.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.938
McGee, you tell Torres to
meet us at Victor's club.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.200
On it.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.854
And why couldn't you go?

27:18.898 --> 27:21.944
Because Gibbs knows
that I'd kill him.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.513
Try again, Joe.

27:25.556 --> 27:28.255
Where's Victor?!GIBBS:
Let him up.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.304
What's up with you
and my neck, man?

27:34.348 --> 27:35.654
What's with Victor?
Where is he?

27:35.697 --> 27:38.308
I swear, I don't know.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.049
No one knows anything
around here.

27:40.093 --> 27:43.705
I know Victor don't pay me
enough for this amount of abuse.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.012
It could get a lot worse.

27:46.055 --> 27:50.799
Victor lies. Okay?
He lies a lot.

27:50.843 --> 27:54.673
He lie about knowing the kid?Yeah, yeah, he knew the kid.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.501
He was always sucking up to
Sahar, giving her little gifts.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.721
Trying to get closer
to both of them.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.462
Gift, like a pendant?What pendant?

28:01.505 --> 28:03.159
GPS. Did he give her one?

28:03.203 --> 28:04.552
Damned if I know.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.120
He was checking some app
on his phone a whole lot.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.078
You know, between all the calls.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.732
What calls?Again, I don't know.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.821
But he made a bunch of 'em
after you left.

28:12.865 --> 28:13.909
When did he leave?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.128
A couple hours ago.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.304
Still checking his phone
and talking smack.

28:17.347 --> 28:18.435
What kind of smack?

28:18.479 --> 28:19.959
About how rich he was gonna get.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.917
Told us to hold down the club
while he went out

28:21.961 --> 28:23.136
and scored a cool mil.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.094
The Libyan gangster,
how much did he say?

28:25.138 --> 28:27.575
A million.Libyan gangster?

28:27.618 --> 28:30.578
The one who might have
Phineas by now.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.808
BISHOP:
I can't believe this guy
lied to our faces

28:42.851 --> 28:44.244
again and again.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.767
And the moment he heard
Sahar was dead,

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
he got on the phone
with Hassan to make a deal.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.989
Boss, hey, just letting you know
we have found

28:50.032 --> 28:51.555
no outgoing flights to any

28:51.599 --> 28:53.557
Middle Eastern countries
tonight.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.038
But we've alerted TSA at every
airport just the same.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.518
GIBBS:
Okay, McGee. Thanks.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.567
You hear that?

29:03.611 --> 29:05.482
What?

29:05.526 --> 29:08.572
Yes. Sorry, I was just,
uh, thinking.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.009
Yeah? Thinking about what?

29:10.052 --> 29:14.840
Well, a lot of things,
but, uh, mainly how...

29:14.883 --> 29:16.842
things come full circle.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.585
I killed Ari to save you.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.892
You killed Sahar to save me.

29:26.329 --> 29:29.158
It's hard to believe that...

29:29.202 --> 29:32.074
it's all coming to an end.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.512
That when we find this boy,

29:35.556 --> 29:39.386
I will be... free.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.738
Huh. That true?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.348
You don't seem so free to me.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.525
Well, I've been preoccupied
with things I have to...

29:48.569 --> 29:49.875
I think it's something else.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.833
All these years,
you've had one goal:

29:51.877 --> 29:54.967
to reunite with your family.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.752
You put that off for me?Well...

29:57.796 --> 30:00.799
You know damn well
I don't need the help.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.153
All right, you got me, Gibbs.

30:07.196 --> 30:11.157
There is another reason that
I'm still trying to figure out.

30:13.115 --> 30:17.990
I have spent years
looking over my shoulder.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.383
You know, like a combat vet.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.646
Trying to return to
some sense of normal.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.519
As a mother,

30:25.562 --> 30:28.739
as a partner.

30:28.783 --> 30:29.740
But can I?

30:29.784 --> 30:31.786
Sure, you can.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.657
No, I'm not so sure.

30:33.701 --> 30:37.661
My anxiety did not die
with Sahar.

30:39.881 --> 30:44.755
What if I'm...

30:44.799 --> 30:48.934
too damaged...

30:48.977 --> 30:51.806
to go back to who I was?

30:55.810 --> 30:57.203
DiNozzo knows you're coming,
right?

30:57.246 --> 30:58.639
Well, that's another issue.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.163
Yes, I called him,
and I left him a message.

31:01.207 --> 31:04.036
But, um, as of now,

31:04.079 --> 31:07.735
I have yet to hear from...[phone chimes]

31:14.568 --> 31:16.135
What is it?

31:16.178 --> 31:17.876
Oh, my God.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.923
Oh, my God. It's...

31:21.967 --> 31:23.882
it's Tali.
[chuckling]

31:25.492 --> 31:27.320
It's Tali. It's...

31:28.364 --> 31:31.890
[chuckles]
Look at her.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.935
Wow.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.937
Oh, she's so...

31:35.981 --> 31:39.898
she's so big
and she's so beautiful.

31:39.941 --> 31:44.076
I guess Tony didn't feel safe
enough to send it up until now.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.907
I love you, Ima.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.909
We miss you.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.218
I love you, too.
[chuckling]

31:57.306 --> 31:59.178
Ziva,

31:59.221 --> 32:00.919
look at me.

32:00.962 --> 32:01.920
Yeah.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.965
You're ready.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.359
[chuckling]

32:06.402 --> 32:07.708
[phone rings]

32:07.751 --> 32:09.971
Yeah, McGee.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.147
Boss, someone just booked
two tickets to Montreal,

32:12.191 --> 32:13.844
with a connection
to Cairo from there.

32:13.888 --> 32:16.717
Someone?Passports show a father and son,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.501
but the seats were paid for
with a company credit card

32:18.545 --> 32:19.938
from Victor's club.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.940
Flight leaves Oakton
Regional Airport in 30 minutes.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.942
GIBBS: Alert TSA.[phone rings]

32:23.985 --> 32:25.204
We're close to Oakton.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.683
BISHOP:
We'll meet you there.

32:26.727 --> 32:29.469
Yes? Uh, oh, thanks for getting
back to me so quickly.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.949
Hey, Jack, let's go.You coming?

32:30.992 --> 32:33.386
Um, I can't.
I got to take this.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.866
Just go.
Go get him.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.782
Thanks for holding.
The reason I called...

32:40.567 --> 32:42.656
PHINEAS:
Where are you taking me?

32:42.699 --> 32:44.919
Just going
on a great adventure, kid.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.486
Be grateful.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.618
Your uncle might even pull you
into the family business.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.011
My uncle lives in Philly.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.708
Not your real uncle Hassan.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.710
He's gonna meet you in Cairo
and then take you

32:53.754 --> 32:55.060
to a cool place called Libya.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.887
I'm not going to Libya!

32:56.931 --> 32:58.411
Hey.
[chuckles]

32:58.454 --> 33:00.021
Hey, buddy.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.544
[quietly]:
Now, what did I say before?

33:01.588 --> 33:04.025
You make a scene,
you do something stupid,

33:04.069 --> 33:06.375
I will kill you right here,
little man.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.681
You feel me?

33:09.204 --> 33:10.162
Okay.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.163
[chuckles loudly]

33:11.206 --> 33:13.034
Sorry.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.036
[chuckles]

33:15.080 --> 33:16.516
You got here fast.

33:16.559 --> 33:17.691
Where to?
Where are they?

33:17.734 --> 33:19.649
Where's international TSA?Through there.

33:22.087 --> 33:26.047
Will you and your son
be visiting Cairo for long...

33:26.091 --> 33:28.223
Mr. Halabi?

33:28.267 --> 33:31.139
Uh, Halabi, yes.
A couple weeks, maybe.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.013
Have you been
to Cairo before?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.365
He's a little shy.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.758
All that "stranger danger"
I teach him.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.847
Mm-hmm.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.110
Okay then.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.068
Why don't we have you
go on through the X-ray.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.983
Off you go, buddy.Sir, hold right here.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.507
Sorry.Take off your bag.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.861
Go ahead.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.428
[beeping]

33:59.472 --> 34:00.647
Come on back.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.866
Anything
in your pockets?

34:02.910 --> 34:05.086
Any change?
You wearing a belt?

34:06.131 --> 34:07.045
Scan, please.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.096
[scanner whining]Mm.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.456
Where the hell
did that come from?

34:27.500 --> 34:28.979
What do you mean, Dad?

34:29.023 --> 34:31.025
You told me to hold it for you.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.114
[snapping fingers]

34:33.158 --> 34:34.463
NCIS.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.986
Where's the flight to Montreal?She's okay.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.379
We're looking for a father
and son traveling together.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.380
Phineas!

34:38.424 --> 34:39.729
Jethro Gibbs!

34:39.773 --> 34:41.383
[chuckling]:
Hey.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.168
Oh, got you. We got you.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.518
Ow, you're crushing my ribs.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.520
You okay?

34:47.563 --> 34:49.087
You're okay.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.784
Did he hurt you?He tried to.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.003
But I stopped him.Wait, what do you mean? How?

34:53.047 --> 34:55.571
Rule nine: always carry a knife.

34:56.964 --> 34:59.793
Just like you told me.[chuckles]

35:09.324 --> 35:11.935
Oh, you really messed up,
Victor.Hey, hey, hey. Just keep

35:11.979 --> 35:13.676
your hands to yourself.
My lawyer's already on his way.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.808
Is that true?No.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.026
We haven't
called anyone.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.724
Another lie, huh?Go to hell.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.815
What's this?

35:21.858 --> 35:22.903
That's for your boss.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.165
So your boss can find me.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.079
Find you for what?

35:25.123 --> 35:25.949
For this.Whoa, whoa!

35:25.993 --> 35:27.081
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.213
He's not worth it.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.128
VICTOR:
Yeah, Apple Pie

35:30.171 --> 35:31.825
to the rescue, huh?
[chuckles mockingly]

35:31.868 --> 35:33.740
Not to you, anyway.

35:33.783 --> 35:37.265
[grunts, groans]

35:39.224 --> 35:41.182
I was just so mad,
Jethro Gibbs,

35:41.226 --> 35:43.053
and scared.

35:43.097 --> 35:46.622
I didn't know what to do
or where else to go.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.058
I know.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.104
We all feel
like that sometimes.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.673
You had a good reason.

35:53.716 --> 35:57.111
[sighs]
I shouldn't have asked.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.896
You know, to move in with you.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.072
You and me, Phin,
we've been through a lot.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.597
And I don't want to make you
any promise I can't keep.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.166
You made it a long way
on your own.

36:08.209 --> 36:11.081
I mean, the-the bike and the bus

36:11.125 --> 36:12.257
and Philly.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.215
[both chuckle]

36:14.259 --> 36:16.826
Still think
your, uh...

36:16.870 --> 36:18.524
your aunt lives in Philly?

36:18.567 --> 36:21.048
I was hoping.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.137
I was with Aunt Micki
and Uncle George

36:23.181 --> 36:25.531
since before I can remember.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.273
Until they didn't want me
anymore.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.578
Wait, wait, wait.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.276
Who told you that?

36:31.319 --> 36:33.278
Mom did.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.235
Hey, Phin.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.455
Maybe she only
told you that

36:36.498 --> 36:37.760
so you wouldn't
miss them so much.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.762
It didn't work.

36:39.806 --> 36:43.853
I think about them every time
Mom got mad or had to go away.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.160
I was hoping,
once they heard what happened

36:46.204 --> 36:48.075
and if I promised to be good,

36:48.118 --> 36:50.033
they might take me back.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.385
Oh, I have a feeling they would.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.826
Aunt Micki?

36:59.869 --> 37:01.610
Phineas. Honey.[chuckles]:
There he is.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.395
[chuckles]
Oh!

37:03.438 --> 37:05.310
Are you okay?

37:05.353 --> 37:06.441
Are you all right?

37:06.485 --> 37:08.530
You know
there hasn't been

37:08.574 --> 37:10.793
a moment
that we haven't missed you.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.013
But Mom said...

37:13.056 --> 37:15.581
No. She was mistaken,
sweetheart.

37:15.624 --> 37:19.149
We've prayed every day
for this day.[chuckles]

37:19.193 --> 37:20.890
You got so big, Phin.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.196
You, too, Uncle George.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.589
[laughs]
Come on. Bring it in.

37:23.632 --> 37:24.633
[chuckles]Oh. [grunts]

37:26.505 --> 37:29.551
[quietly]:
How did you find them?

37:29.595 --> 37:32.598
[whispers]:
Miracles happen.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.170
Daddy says come visit,
Uncle Tim,

37:40.214 --> 37:42.738
so I can meet my cousins
and play.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.958
[chuckles]Cute kid.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.699
Cute? She's adorable.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.309
Delilah's never
been to Paris.I have,

37:48.353 --> 37:49.789
if you need any help
with the twins.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.791
I am just saying.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.359
Daddy says come visit,
Uncle Tim...

37:54.402 --> 37:56.622
Gibbs says great things
about you, Jack Sloane.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.711
And from what you accomplished
today...

37:58.754 --> 37:59.929
Hey, it's days like these

37:59.973 --> 38:02.018
that make the bad days
worthwhile, right?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.237
You can say that again.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.196
Thank you for taking care
of his heart.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.372
Ah.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.156
We take care of each other's.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.158
You take good care of yours.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.248
Mm-hmm. And thank you for
arranging my flight so quickly,

38:14.292 --> 38:15.467
Director.
Tell Ducky

38:15.510 --> 38:17.947
that I will call him
when I am settled.

38:17.991 --> 38:18.948
Will do.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.646
Godspeed, Agent David.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.474
Old habits. Ziva.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.475
Take care.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.476
You, too.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.304
JIMMY:
Let's go.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.827
Your chariot awaits.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.656
A ride to the airport?
Now, that is a real friend.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.048
Oh, I'm charging her.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.312
[both chuckle]

38:36.401 --> 38:38.359
Bonne chance, lÃ©gende.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.143
Ah, trÃ¨s gentil,
mon amie Kasie.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.449
Oh.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.061
Merci,I think.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.541
[both chuckle]

38:46.585 --> 38:48.804
Agent Torres,
come over here, please.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.461
If my child ever went missing,

38:53.505 --> 38:55.898
God forbid, you'd be the person
I'd want searching.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.900
Well, thanks.

38:57.944 --> 39:01.295
My only regret is that
we never had that rematch.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.862
Ah. I was hoping for that, too.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.081
Since you let me win.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.169
Aha!

39:06.213 --> 39:07.432
Hello?

39:07.475 --> 39:09.259
Didn't I tell everyone?

39:09.303 --> 39:11.044
I let her win.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.394
Had to get him started, huh?

39:13.438 --> 39:15.614
[quietly]:
Tell her how you feel, you wuss.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.267
[chuckles]

39:17.311 --> 39:20.270
Hey, tell Tony
I'm waiting for my video.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.534
Oh, I'm sure
he'll send it to you.

39:22.577 --> 39:26.059
And, Agent Bishop,
if I may,

39:26.102 --> 39:27.452
you have not filled my shoes--

39:27.495 --> 39:29.105
you have overgrown them.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.846
Hmm.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.979
Odette...

39:33.022 --> 39:34.807
will be ready when you are.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.465
A handshake.Mm-hmm.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.426
Ah.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.255
I will miss you most of all,
Scarecrow.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.691
Wizard of Oz.

39:49.735 --> 39:52.564
Tony would be so proud.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.913
See you soon.

39:53.956 --> 39:56.002
I'll see you very soon, Dorothy.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.439
Mm-hmm.[chuckles softly]

39:58.483 --> 40:00.528
Can't be late. Let's go.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.799
Oh, good.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.062
I thought I
missed you.[chuckles]

40:13.106 --> 40:15.848
Well, I know you hate goodbyes.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.372
I trust Phineas is okay?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.417
Yeah.

40:19.460 --> 40:20.722
He'll be fine.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.292
I don't know what to say.

40:25.335 --> 40:27.512
Nothing to say.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.515
You're ready.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.692
I am ready.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.437
[whispers]:
We're always here for you.

40:52.711 --> 40:55.409
Don't make us come looking.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.854
