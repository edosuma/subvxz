WEBVTT

00:00.138 --> 00:01.336
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:01.338 --> 00:03.032
I took the blame for the explosion

00:03.034 --> 00:05.214
at my headquarters. I
forfeited my fortune.

00:05.217 --> 00:06.968
You were being funded by Rittenhouse.

00:06.971 --> 00:09.218
I allowed myself to become a global joke.

00:09.221 --> 00:11.207
These seizures are more than seizures.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.960
They're premonitions of the future.

00:12.962 --> 00:14.962
And lately, they've been of your future.

00:14.964 --> 00:16.903
I had a vision about a
man dying, and he died.

00:16.906 --> 00:19.166
Maybe you shouldn't tell
me what's in your visions.

00:19.168 --> 00:20.568
I know everything about you.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.421
You want to know how I know?

00:22.424 --> 00:24.090
- I didn't write that.
- But you will.

00:24.093 --> 00:26.468
She and I are gonna be
quite the team one day.

00:26.471 --> 00:27.790
You never told me where you got it from.

00:27.792 --> 00:29.876
- You gave it to me.
- Uh, no, I didn't.

00:29.879 --> 00:32.647
- Not yet.
- We have each other.

00:32.649 --> 00:35.650
- Don't we?
- Yes.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.485
Jessica's alive.

00:37.487 --> 00:39.587
Lucy, I'm so sorry.

00:39.589 --> 00:42.356
I love you, but I can't be
married to a state secret.

00:42.358 --> 00:43.824
No, I'm gonna tell you everything.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.226
Try not to freak out.

00:50.956 --> 00:52.640
You were always on Wyatt's mind,

00:52.643 --> 00:54.068
because he never stopped loving you.

00:54.070 --> 00:55.603
Jessica's giving me a second chance,

00:55.605 --> 00:56.938
and she said it was 'cause of you.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.174
You deserve to finally be happy, Wyatt.

01:00.870 --> 01:03.689
_

01:03.736 --> 01:08.721
_

01:10.660 --> 01:12.719
Some people say he made
a deal with the devil.

01:12.722 --> 01:13.903
That true, Donny?

01:13.906 --> 01:15.489
Betty, these Delta blues singers

01:15.491 --> 01:16.691
are full of stories.

01:16.693 --> 01:18.693
But how you know that for sure?

01:18.695 --> 01:22.563
It's all just superstitions
and hocus-pocus, that's how.

01:22.565 --> 01:24.265
I wouldn't bet money on that.

01:25.976 --> 01:28.301
I might be the best guitar
player around, Mr. Law,

01:28.304 --> 01:31.105
but five years ago, I
couldn't play a lick.

01:31.107 --> 01:33.874
Now how else but the devil you
think that could've happened?

01:33.876 --> 01:36.177
Well, I guess we'll just have to see

01:36.179 --> 01:38.079
if you're the best around, Robert.

01:38.081 --> 01:39.915
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

01:44.387 --> 01:47.754
Betty... get Mr. Johnson and me

01:47.757 --> 01:49.657
two Orange-Crush sodas from the corner?

01:49.659 --> 01:51.859
But I thought you said
I could watch him play.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.761
I promise, I'll play
everything you missed

01:53.763 --> 01:54.762
later on tonight.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.743 --> 02:08.542
I have you set up just
the way you asked...

02:09.679 --> 02:10.745
Facing the wall.

02:10.747 --> 02:11.812
Is that right?

02:15.251 --> 02:17.418
What's the matter, Robert?

02:17.420 --> 02:19.421
Too shy to be famous?

02:21.991 --> 02:24.559
I'm gonna make us both famous.

02:33.936 --> 02:37.238
♪ I went to the crossroad ♪

02:37.240 --> 02:40.174

03:18.047 --> 03:19.559
Hey.

03:19.562 --> 03:22.029
Hey, I'm glad you and
Jessica are enjoying the room.

03:22.032 --> 03:23.384
I know, I feel bad about...

03:23.386 --> 03:24.911
Because that 1950s

03:24.914 --> 03:26.420
Kem Weber sofa sleeps like a dream.

03:26.422 --> 03:27.822
It's like staying at the Four Seasons.

03:27.824 --> 03:28.918
- Really?
- Yeah, except there's only

03:28.920 --> 03:30.957
ever one season, and
that season is winter.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.560
Look, I owe you, okay?

03:32.562 --> 03:34.006
Yeah, well, you might
want to use that towel

03:34.008 --> 03:36.496
to stuff under the door
to stop the, uh, noise.

03:36.499 --> 03:39.667
This is still, believe it
or not, a work environment.

03:42.648 --> 03:45.206
Rufus, why don't you and Jiya
take our room for a few nights?

03:45.208 --> 03:46.989
I'll be fine on the couch, really.

03:46.992 --> 03:49.310
- Morning, Wyatt.
- Hi.

03:51.647 --> 03:55.182
But I really have to pee.

04:17.373 --> 04:20.673
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just, um...

04:20.676 --> 04:22.276
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

04:22.278 --> 04:24.670
Because of weird vision-related reasons?

04:24.673 --> 04:26.247
If so, I told you I'd rather not know.

04:26.249 --> 04:28.282
No, I just, because of...

04:28.284 --> 04:30.732
Too much red wine last
night, okay? Take it easy.

04:30.735 --> 04:32.568
Um...

04:32.571 --> 04:34.388
Any luck adding a fourth
seat to the "Lifeboat"?

04:34.390 --> 04:35.609
Well, unlike the Mothership,

04:35.612 --> 04:38.224
this baby was put together
with tinfoil and Juicy Fruit.

04:38.227 --> 04:41.228
But the math is good as long
as the coding checks out.

04:43.432 --> 04:45.087
Muah, muah!

04:45.090 --> 04:47.635
And that, my love, is how
you upgrade a time machine.

04:47.637 --> 04:50.504
Bravo, bravo, bravo.

04:50.506 --> 04:53.140
Outstanding work... See, you and Jiya

04:53.142 --> 04:54.475
didn't need me mucking it up.

04:54.477 --> 04:56.577
Are you drunk?

04:56.579 --> 04:58.979
"Life is but a walking shadow,

04:58.981 --> 05:02.950
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage,

05:02.952 --> 05:05.119
and then is heard no more."

05:05.121 --> 05:06.387
So, yes, then?

05:06.389 --> 05:08.389
But I have something to add

05:08.391 --> 05:10.324
to the merriment.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.526
"Icarus Descending:

05:12.528 --> 05:16.463
The Fall & Catastrophe of Connor Mason."

05:16.465 --> 05:17.736
Yikes.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.155
Why are you even reading this stuff?

05:19.157 --> 05:23.003
Because, Rufus, today is the day

05:23.005 --> 05:26.307
I finally lose control...

05:26.309 --> 05:29.720
Of Mason Industries
and all of my holdings.

05:32.081 --> 05:36.984
Today, Connor Mason is officially, um...

05:36.986 --> 05:39.854
nobody.

05:39.856 --> 05:41.822
A toast.

05:41.824 --> 05:44.692
To oblivion.

05:44.694 --> 05:46.660
Oblivion!

05:50.032 --> 05:52.766
- Wyatt.
- Where've you been?

05:52.768 --> 05:54.668
- I need to speak with you.
- What's up?

05:56.305 --> 05:58.197
Damn it, the Mothership jumped.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.874
We got to deal with that first.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.242
First?

06:01.244 --> 06:03.143
What are we dealing with second?

06:03.145 --> 06:06.814
San Antonio, Texas. November 23, 1936.

06:06.816 --> 06:07.923
Lucy?

06:07.926 --> 06:10.681
The Texas Centennial Exposition?

06:10.684 --> 06:13.151
6 million people attended,
including President Roosevelt.

06:13.154 --> 06:15.121
FDR sounds like a
Rittenhouse target to me.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.124
Agreed, but the Exposition
took place in Dallas,

06:17.126 --> 06:19.026
- a few hundred miles away.
- What about you?

06:19.028 --> 06:20.694
Ever pick up any
Rittenhouse intel about this?

06:20.696 --> 06:22.173
- Zilch.
- Well, if you're not here

06:22.176 --> 06:24.198
to provide intelligence,
what are you good for?

06:24.200 --> 06:28.502
It's got to be the Gunter
Hotel, it's obvious.

06:28.504 --> 06:31.705
The Gunter Hotel is in San Antonio.

06:31.707 --> 06:32.767
Connor, can you just...

06:32.770 --> 06:34.674
Why would Rittenhouse
care about a hotel?

06:34.677 --> 06:37.177
Because in that hotel

06:37.179 --> 06:39.747
on November the 23rd, 1936,

06:39.749 --> 06:44.585
Robert Johnson and Don
Law changed the world.

06:44.587 --> 06:46.720
How?

06:46.722 --> 06:49.001
By recording a series of albums.

06:49.004 --> 06:50.691
Okay, keep drinking.

06:50.693 --> 06:53.294
Robert Johnson.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.897
King of the Delta blues?

06:56.899 --> 06:59.033
Father of rock 'n' roll?

06:59.035 --> 07:00.743
You people are philistines!

07:00.746 --> 07:01.954
Are you saying Rittenhouse

07:01.957 --> 07:04.170
is going after some blues singer?

07:04.173 --> 07:06.173
The blues singer.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.741
Look, if it wasn't for Robert Johnson,

07:07.743 --> 07:09.304
there'd be no modern blues.

07:09.307 --> 07:11.644
No modern blues, no rock
'n' roll, none of your Elvis,

07:11.647 --> 07:13.981
Beatles, Stones,
Zeppelin... None of them.

07:13.983 --> 07:16.283
Which is bad... no doubt,
no one wants to listen to

07:16.285 --> 07:18.285
Pat Boone on a radio 24/7,
but I think I'm missing

07:18.287 --> 07:19.720
the larger geopolitical point.

07:19.722 --> 07:21.522
Actually, Mason makes sense.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.624
It wouldn't just be Rittenhouse
killing rock 'n' roll

07:23.626 --> 07:25.426
at its source, it would be them killing

07:25.428 --> 07:27.328
the cultural revolution of the 1960s,

07:27.330 --> 07:28.963
the civil rights movement, the...

07:28.965 --> 07:31.131
The fall of Nixon, the
end of the Vietnam War,

07:31.133 --> 07:33.133
the counterculture as we know it.

07:33.135 --> 07:35.669
Wait, wait, wait, you're
saying all of this happens

07:35.671 --> 07:37.356
because two guys don't record an album?

07:37.359 --> 07:39.540
Precisely.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.875
Get the "Lifeboat"
prepped. Gear up. Get going.

07:41.877 --> 07:43.444
Fourth seat's ready.
I say Connor takes it.

07:43.446 --> 07:45.879
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Absolutely not.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.250
Connor, you obviously know more

07:48.253 --> 07:50.616
about Robert Johnson and
his albums than any of us.

07:50.619 --> 07:52.152
Yeah...

07:52.154 --> 07:54.355
So I'll debrief Lucy as
you prepare to launch.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.458
Are you...

07:57.460 --> 08:00.361
you are afraid of riding
in your own invention.

08:00.363 --> 08:01.829
Wait a minute.

08:01.831 --> 08:04.431
All those test trips before we met you?

08:04.433 --> 08:06.667
You never once time traveled yourself?

08:06.669 --> 08:08.422
It's bloody dangerous.

08:08.425 --> 08:09.769
Yeah, I know.

08:09.772 --> 08:11.338
And perhaps Rufus and Jiya

08:11.340 --> 08:13.774
have made the correct
calculations to safely

08:13.776 --> 08:15.476
- transport a fourth person.
- We did.

08:15.479 --> 08:17.378
Yes, but perhaps you didn't, so no.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.946
You're going. Get Connor some coffee.

08:18.948 --> 08:20.714
Hey, you... hey, wait one damn minute.

08:20.716 --> 08:22.262
Flynn, you're on board this mission.

08:22.265 --> 08:23.715
Wyatt, you're staying here with me.

08:23.718 --> 08:24.838
- What?
- But why?

08:24.841 --> 08:26.542
- You can't be serious.
- Look, Flynn's already been

08:26.544 --> 08:28.489
on a couple of missions. We
either start trusting him,

08:28.491 --> 08:29.531
- or we don't.
- We don't.

08:29.534 --> 08:32.302
- We definitely don't.
- Too bad.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.128
Oh.

08:42.405 --> 08:43.570
Keep them safe.

08:44.646 --> 08:47.446
I wouldn't have it any other way.

09:03.159 --> 09:06.827
Please, you don't trust Flynn
any more than Rufus or me.

09:06.829 --> 09:10.964
What the hell is going on here?
Why am I not with the team?

09:10.966 --> 09:13.901
How would you like to take
out Rittenhouse for good?

09:16.768 --> 09:21.187
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

09:21.896 --> 09:24.794
- Carol Preston held me here.
- How'd you find it?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.877
From the GPS chip implanted in my neck.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.296
It was pinging from that
location for eight hours.

09:29.298 --> 09:30.998
- Sure, super normal.
- But we need you

09:31.000 --> 09:33.083
to raid that facility.
We'll give you a helmet-cam,

09:33.086 --> 09:34.777
and Jiya and I will have
eyes on you from here.

09:34.779 --> 09:37.404
- How big's my team?
- You're going solo.

09:37.406 --> 09:39.006
Against all of Rittenhouse?

09:39.008 --> 09:40.541
You're sending in the cavalry?

09:40.543 --> 09:43.410
I don't trust the
cavalry. I trust Wyatt.

09:43.412 --> 09:46.080
Now, this is only an
intelligence gathering mission,

09:46.082 --> 09:48.924
not an assault... get in,
get what's there, get out.

09:48.927 --> 09:52.453
Modern day, modern weapons. I'm in.

09:52.455 --> 09:53.821
Let me grab my gear and tell Jess

09:53.823 --> 09:55.268
not to expect me for dinner.

09:55.271 --> 09:56.557
Jiya?

09:56.559 --> 09:59.360
Jiya? Are you all right?

09:59.362 --> 10:00.627
Can I ask you a question?

10:00.630 --> 10:02.863
Yeah. What?

10:02.865 --> 10:05.260
Is it okay to keep secrets
from someone you love?

10:05.263 --> 10:08.636
What kind of secrets?
What are you talking about?

10:08.638 --> 10:11.272
Nothing. Uh, Rufus and me...
Just relationship issues.

10:11.274 --> 10:13.724
Never mind.

10:13.727 --> 10:16.238
All right, set up the link.
He's leaving in ten minutes.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.307
Yup.

10:22.184 --> 10:24.051
Our earliest pilots would report

10:24.053 --> 10:27.688
how like the present
the past initially seems.

10:27.690 --> 10:30.024
The sound, the air...

10:30.026 --> 10:34.705
Like nothing's changed
except space-time compression.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.897
And look, I can see the hairs...

10:36.899 --> 10:41.402
stand from the
quantum-gravitational bursts.

10:41.404 --> 10:44.138
And I can hear the faintest sparks

10:44.140 --> 10:46.140
crackle in the air.

10:46.142 --> 10:48.475
Ah, this is quite ex...

10:50.513 --> 10:53.013
And boom goes the dynamite!

10:54.622 --> 10:56.884
So how long until
Johnson records his album?

10:56.886 --> 10:58.719
Um, um,

10:58.721 --> 11:00.577
one hour and 17 minutes.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.523
- Better hurry.
- Yes, let's get going.

11:02.525 --> 11:04.625
Um, h-how do we begin?

11:04.627 --> 11:07.561
Get some clothes, steal a car.

11:07.563 --> 11:08.762
Okay.

11:20.876 --> 11:24.278
♪ You can run, you can run ♪

11:24.280 --> 11:27.614
♪ Tell my friend Willie Brown ♪

11:30.386 --> 11:33.186
♪ You can run, you can run ♪

11:33.189 --> 11:35.556
♪ Tell my friend Willie Brown ♪

11:36.859 --> 11:38.125
Oh!

11:43.065 --> 11:46.133
What the holy hell?

11:46.135 --> 11:48.210
I'm Taylor Swift, this
is Agent Timberlake.

11:48.213 --> 11:49.908
We're part of the new FBI.

11:49.911 --> 11:51.303
H-Hoover's hiring women?

11:51.306 --> 11:52.873
We're reorganizing.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.742
With Negroes?

11:54.744 --> 11:56.577
Well, we're...

11:56.580 --> 12:00.914
I'm Lando Calrissian,
British Intelligence.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.317
Kenya station.

12:03.319 --> 12:06.520
His Majesty sends his regards.

12:06.522 --> 12:08.922
So we'll just remove the deceased,

12:08.924 --> 12:10.366
and you gentlemen can continue doing

12:10.369 --> 12:11.461
whatever it is you were doing.

12:11.463 --> 12:13.343
Remove the deceased? Are you mad?

12:13.346 --> 12:14.828
That ofay just tried to kill us,

12:14.830 --> 12:16.307
and you want us to pretend
like it didn't happen?

12:16.309 --> 12:18.497
No, no, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.639
He was a bootlegger, a common hood.

12:20.642 --> 12:21.835
He must've come in here by accident.

12:21.837 --> 12:23.570
No, he didn't come in by
accident... he was aiming

12:23.572 --> 12:25.172
- his gun at you, wasn't he?
- Now hold on, Mr. Law,

12:25.174 --> 12:26.409
I don't know who in the hell that is...

12:26.411 --> 12:28.775
- Or was, come on, now.
- They-they warned me.

12:28.778 --> 12:30.811
They said, "Donald,
don't record with Johnson,

12:30.813 --> 12:33.047
he's cursed," and the proof of
that pudding's in the eating.

12:33.049 --> 12:34.248
Man, I got your pudding right here!

12:34.250 --> 12:35.546
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

12:35.549 --> 12:36.937
You know, I don't need
this crap, I'm out of here.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.684
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us... get out!

12:38.687 --> 12:40.287
Listen, Law, perhaps you can reconsider.

12:40.289 --> 12:42.056
Take your damn hand off me, sir.

12:42.058 --> 12:44.144
Look, you gentlemen have
to resolve this disagreement

12:44.147 --> 12:47.461
and record this record. It's important.

12:47.463 --> 12:48.962
Now, why would British
intelligence care about

12:48.964 --> 12:51.022
a music recording session, hmm?

12:51.025 --> 12:53.058
Well, uh,

12:53.061 --> 12:54.701
well, I suppose it's...

12:54.703 --> 12:56.537
- We're fans.
- Huge fans.

12:56.539 --> 12:57.738
Huge, big fans.

12:57.740 --> 13:00.407
Incredible fans.

13:00.409 --> 13:03.378
Yeah, well, whatever you
are, you're wasting your time.

13:03.381 --> 13:04.242
Why is that?

13:04.245 --> 13:06.459
The other half of the
equation's gone, isn't he?

13:06.462 --> 13:07.848
Good luck finding him.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.433
His disappearing acts are legendary.

13:09.436 --> 13:11.120
Lucy, we... we obviously

13:11.123 --> 13:12.623
have to find Robert
before he leaves town.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.926
You and Rufus... You go after Johnson.

13:13.928 --> 13:16.233
We'll stay here with Law. Go.

13:18.236 --> 13:19.635
Now, would you kindly remove

13:19.638 --> 13:21.328
your dead fugitive from my equipment?

13:26.001 --> 13:28.038
You have to help Robert
Johnson make this album.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.571
No, madam, I do not.

13:30.573 --> 13:34.374
My father was right.
I'm a three-time loser.

13:34.376 --> 13:35.843
I don't think you're a loser.

13:35.845 --> 13:37.211
I think what you're doing is amazing.

13:37.213 --> 13:40.180
And how would you know?

13:40.182 --> 13:43.162
Because Robert Johnson's amazing.

13:43.165 --> 13:45.031
And you could make him a legend.

13:45.034 --> 13:47.588
He could be the next Fats
Waller or Billie Holiday.

13:47.590 --> 13:49.189
I tried.

13:49.191 --> 13:52.401
I nearly ended up dead for my trouble.

13:52.404 --> 13:54.069
Do you want to be a bookkeeper

13:54.072 --> 13:56.329
- the rest of your life?
- How would you know that?

13:56.332 --> 13:58.899
I told you, we're the
FBI. We know things.

13:58.901 --> 14:01.001
Look, I get that it's a
lot safer at your desk,

14:01.003 --> 14:02.851
but your instincts
about Johnson are right.

14:02.854 --> 14:04.938
He's...

14:04.940 --> 14:07.207
He's a special talent.

14:07.209 --> 14:08.389
He is, isn't he?

14:08.392 --> 14:10.081
And this could be your
chance to change the world

14:10.083 --> 14:13.384
and prove to your father
just how wrong he is.

14:13.387 --> 14:16.343
Or you can just keep being a bookkeeper.

14:18.287 --> 14:19.620
I get what you're doing.

14:19.622 --> 14:21.155
It's a shameless manipulation.

14:21.157 --> 14:22.589
I didn't mean any disrespect, Mr. Law...

14:22.591 --> 14:24.425
I didn't say it didn't work.

14:28.713 --> 14:30.364
I might have some spare vacuum tubes

14:30.367 --> 14:31.401
and repair parts in my truck.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.503
If your lads can find Robert...

14:32.505 --> 14:33.570
They'll find him.

14:35.104 --> 14:36.179
All right.

14:44.613 --> 14:47.100
Robert! Mr. Johnson, hold up!

14:47.103 --> 14:49.062
Look, now, I don't want
no trouble from y'all.

14:49.065 --> 14:50.851
- We don't want any either.
- Where you going?

14:50.853 --> 14:52.653
Not that it's any of your
damn business, mister,

14:52.655 --> 14:54.188
but I'm fixing to see my sister.

14:54.190 --> 14:55.989
Well, how about before
that you give us a chance

14:55.991 --> 14:57.391
to make things right with Mr. Law?

14:57.393 --> 14:59.459
Ain't no going back. I'm cursed.

14:59.461 --> 15:00.928
I made a deal with the devil

15:00.930 --> 15:02.649
and now his note's finally coming due.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.071
That old recording washout

15:04.074 --> 15:05.731
was just the devil
having himself a laugh.

15:05.734 --> 15:08.101
Mr. Johnson, the record you make today

15:08.103 --> 15:09.670
could change the world.

15:09.672 --> 15:12.084
Friend-boy, I'm just a
Delta blues singer that play

15:12.087 --> 15:13.840
for get-backs, Saturday night balls,

15:13.842 --> 15:15.142
and street corner pennies...

15:15.144 --> 15:17.144
Ol' Bob ain't changing a damn thing.

15:17.146 --> 15:19.613
Your sister's name is Carrie Thompson,

15:19.615 --> 15:21.982
She says she's the only
person you still love,

15:21.985 --> 15:24.685
and the only one you've never hurt.

15:24.687 --> 15:27.454
She owns a juke joint,
doesn't she? Not too far away.

15:27.456 --> 15:29.223
- You know Carrie?
- Oh, yeah.

15:29.225 --> 15:31.024
She's very lively.

15:31.026 --> 15:33.006
Tied a few on at her
bar from time to time.

15:33.009 --> 15:34.308
Connor, what are you doing?

15:34.311 --> 15:37.188
So why don't we take you
there, drive you to her place?

15:37.191 --> 15:39.678
I thought you said we had to
get him to record at the hotel?

15:39.681 --> 15:42.169
If Johnson won't go to Law,
we'll get Lucy and Flynn

15:42.171 --> 15:44.338
to bring Law to him.
What choice do we have?

15:44.340 --> 15:45.672
Come on.

15:51.113 --> 15:52.634
All right, friend-boys.

15:52.637 --> 15:54.214
But I don't want to
hear nothing else about

15:54.216 --> 15:55.649
making no doggone record.

15:55.651 --> 15:58.218
Oh, your lips to God's ears.

16:15.404 --> 16:17.471
You guys getting this?

16:17.473 --> 16:19.740
Coming in clear.

16:19.742 --> 16:21.412
Agent Christopher, this look familiar?

16:21.415 --> 16:22.744
Believe me, this is it.

16:27.883 --> 16:29.381
Wait, go back. Your eight!

16:31.153 --> 16:32.419
Oh, my God, Wyatt!

16:36.225 --> 16:37.225
Wyatt?

16:49.371 --> 16:50.871
Wyatt?

16:52.374 --> 16:54.175
Wyatt?

16:55.511 --> 16:57.611
Yeah, I'm here.

16:57.613 --> 16:59.846
Are you okay?

16:59.848 --> 17:02.916
A lot better than this dick.

17:02.918 --> 17:05.585
Looks like I just risked
my neck for an empty room.

17:05.587 --> 17:07.221
Does he have anything on him?

17:12.221 --> 17:13.920
Some kind of key fob.

17:13.923 --> 17:15.896
Wyatt, is there a serial number on it?

17:15.897 --> 17:20.067
Yeah, TS PROX D02 531279.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.935
Can you hack it?

17:21.936 --> 17:24.404
Issued by AICS Securities.

17:24.406 --> 17:27.703
It's a high-frequency access
fob to a priority client.

17:27.705 --> 17:29.506
Do we have a name? A
company? An individual?

17:29.509 --> 17:31.144
- No.
- What about an address?

17:31.146 --> 17:33.647
What we need is Rittenhouse's
base of operations.

17:33.649 --> 17:36.416
There's a pretty advanced firewall here.

17:36.418 --> 17:38.785
Give me a couple hours to crack it.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.966
Your friend better make that call quick,

17:52.968 --> 17:54.592
or we can't get out of here fast enough.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.970
- Yeah.
- Operator?

17:56.972 --> 17:58.805
I need you to connect
me to the Gunter Hotel.

17:58.807 --> 18:00.340
It's important.

18:00.342 --> 18:03.810
So, um, are we gonna
get to hear you play

18:03.812 --> 18:05.368
at your sister's juke joint?

18:05.371 --> 18:06.637
Won't be there long enough.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.373
Just dropping in to say good-bye.

18:08.376 --> 18:09.704
- Good-bye?
- Yeah.

18:09.707 --> 18:11.518
I'm gonna ramble on and get myself gone,

18:11.520 --> 18:13.053
where no one'll ever find me.

18:13.055 --> 18:15.096
Rollin' stones gather no moss.

18:15.099 --> 18:16.732
Are you sure that's a good idea?

18:16.735 --> 18:18.592
- What do you give a damn?
- Mr. Johnson,

18:18.594 --> 18:21.595
you can make a guitar sound like two.

18:21.597 --> 18:23.697
You're a poet.

18:23.699 --> 18:28.668
You could be great... Truly great.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.376
You some kind of expert on me?

18:30.379 --> 18:32.038
Look, Mr. Law...

18:32.040 --> 18:35.271
Believes in your talent, and so do I.

18:35.274 --> 18:38.145
No, Mr. Law believes
I'm cursed, and I agree.

18:38.147 --> 18:40.668
I left a message for Lucy.
I just hope she gets it.

18:40.671 --> 18:42.670
Yeah, I know the story, Robert.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.885
How you tried to play at
the Saturday night balls

18:44.887 --> 18:46.853
and the other bluesmen
would just laugh at you

18:46.855 --> 18:49.189
because... well, you weren't any good.

18:49.191 --> 18:54.828
So you went down to the
crossroads one midnight...

18:54.830 --> 18:57.664
and let the devil tune your guitar

18:57.666 --> 19:01.220
in exchange for your soul,

19:01.223 --> 19:02.735
and the next time you played,

19:02.738 --> 19:05.228
those bluesmen were shining your shoes.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.909
Yeah, well, the devil tricked me.

19:08.911 --> 19:10.410
I'm sorry, are we talking about this

19:10.412 --> 19:11.845
like it really happened?

19:11.847 --> 19:13.580
The devil made me a widower at 18

19:13.582 --> 19:15.715
and did it to me again when I was 21.

19:15.717 --> 19:17.751
And I'll tell you
something else, mister.

19:17.753 --> 19:20.654
People around me don't
make out so good neither.

19:20.656 --> 19:23.657
They've been shot, stabbed, poisoned.

19:23.659 --> 19:26.260
Death and heartbreak
follow me everywhere I turn.

19:28.897 --> 19:31.264
I can't do it no more.

19:31.266 --> 19:32.799
I can't keep hurting and disappointing

19:32.801 --> 19:35.235
the people I love.

19:35.237 --> 19:36.903
If you ever struck a
deal with the devil,

19:36.905 --> 19:38.939
then you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

19:38.941 --> 19:41.541
Maybe not quite as literally.

19:41.543 --> 19:45.479
But I've made my own
deal with the devil.

19:45.481 --> 19:47.081
It cost me everything I had.

19:53.689 --> 19:57.090
Then you understand
the tune I'm playing.

19:57.092 --> 19:59.427
When I say good-bye to my sister...

20:02.364 --> 20:05.265
I'm walking away from
that guitar for good.

20:07.436 --> 20:10.036
Come on.

20:22.044 --> 20:23.443
What did you with the body?

20:23.445 --> 20:26.047
You really want to know?

20:29.117 --> 20:30.437
Where's the bookkeeper?

20:30.440 --> 20:33.203
Law went to go get the
equipment to fix the recorder.

20:33.206 --> 20:35.940
Lucy...

20:35.943 --> 20:40.113
I think it's time we, uh,
leveled with each other.

20:42.564 --> 20:46.833
I'm way more fun on these
missions than Wyatt, right?

20:46.835 --> 20:49.603
You're delusional.

20:53.108 --> 20:55.241
Must be, uh,

20:55.243 --> 20:57.577
awkward between you two.

20:57.579 --> 20:59.062
It's not awkward between us.

20:59.065 --> 21:01.312
Wyatt and Rufus giggling like schoolboys

21:01.315 --> 21:03.982
about Wyatt's late-night
activities with Jessica?

21:03.985 --> 21:05.852
That wasn't awkward?

21:05.854 --> 21:08.188
- Nope.
- So that's not why

21:08.190 --> 21:12.425
you secretly keep a bottle
of vodka under your bed?

21:12.427 --> 21:14.414
- Are you spying on me?
- No.

21:14.417 --> 21:18.214
I do remember reading
about it in your journal.

21:18.217 --> 21:20.067
Lucy, when you gave me that book...

21:20.070 --> 21:21.768
Which may or may not be true.

21:21.770 --> 21:23.169
No, you gave it to me,

21:23.171 --> 21:25.538
you wanted me to read it, and I did.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.578
Look, at first, all I cared
about was that it was a tool

21:28.581 --> 21:31.281
to take down Rittenhouse,
but the more I read it,

21:31.284 --> 21:33.479
the longer I stayed with
it, the more I felt like

21:33.482 --> 21:35.849
I knew you, understood you.

21:35.851 --> 21:37.665
Lucy, damn it, sometimes,

21:37.668 --> 21:39.828
I feel like I know you
better than you know yourself.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.897
What do you want from me, Flynn?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.101
You don't know me.

21:45.175 --> 21:46.508
Well, I guess we're having

21:46.511 --> 21:48.328
our own awkward moment right now.

21:54.035 --> 21:56.202
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

21:56.204 --> 21:59.774
I've got a message here
from a Rufus Carlin?

22:02.477 --> 22:03.910
Girl, you full of fire tonight.

22:03.912 --> 22:05.111
Come on!

22:14.523 --> 22:16.389
Now this the one place
I don't have to worry

22:16.391 --> 22:18.691
about the devil playing tricks on me.

22:32.374 --> 22:34.274
Man,

22:34.276 --> 22:36.843
you lucky you ain't step on my shoes.

22:36.845 --> 22:38.378
Yes, sir, I am.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.347
He meant no harm.

22:43.051 --> 22:44.484
I've got this.

22:44.486 --> 22:46.586
I've studied this world of sharecroppers

22:46.588 --> 22:49.255
and juke joints my entire life.

22:49.257 --> 22:51.391
Bob? Is that you?

22:51.393 --> 22:54.294
You ol' dog, get over here.

22:54.296 --> 22:56.963
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

22:56.965 --> 22:58.841
Listen, you all seen Carrie?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.967
She stepped out not too long ago.

23:00.969 --> 23:02.168
She'll be back.

23:02.170 --> 23:03.403
So who these two rag tags

23:03.405 --> 23:04.838
you got with you here now?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.539
Thought they might
just be giving me a ride

23:06.541 --> 23:08.975
from San Antonio, but I guess
they be staying for a drink.

23:08.977 --> 23:10.376
Muddy Waters!

23:10.378 --> 23:15.048
And you're Eddie "Son" House, Jr.

23:15.050 --> 23:16.850
But this...

23:16.852 --> 23:19.452
This is the nonpareil

23:19.454 --> 23:22.121
Ms. Bessie Smith.

23:24.726 --> 23:25.993
Say that again.

23:28.063 --> 23:29.863
I thought you said you had this.

23:29.865 --> 23:31.631
What did I do wrong?

23:31.633 --> 23:34.934
Uh, the nonpareil,

23:34.936 --> 23:37.270
Ms. Bessie Smith?

23:37.272 --> 23:39.105
Mm-mm.

23:41.343 --> 23:43.576
You damn right I am.

23:45.313 --> 23:46.794
Hey, hey,

23:46.797 --> 23:48.882
get a load of the King
of England over here.

23:50.285 --> 23:52.485
Honey, I love the way you talk.

23:52.487 --> 23:54.454
Well then, the drinks are on me!

23:56.691 --> 23:58.044
May I sit with you?

23:58.047 --> 23:59.825
Please, have a seat.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.476
Oh, Don? Don't bother coming up,

24:07.479 --> 24:08.935
we're gonna go over to
Johnson's sister's place

24:08.937 --> 24:10.470
and record him there.
We'll get the stuff.

24:10.472 --> 24:12.005
Carrie's juke joint,
yeah, we was looking

24:12.007 --> 24:14.240
- for him there last week.
- We?

24:20.382 --> 24:22.515
Don? Stay here.

24:26.454 --> 24:28.454
Don?

24:28.456 --> 24:30.156
It was another sleeper agent.

24:30.158 --> 24:32.393
And we just sent her
straight to Rufus and Mason.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.063
The sleeper should only be
a few minutes ahead of us.

24:50.065 --> 24:52.500
Yeah, but she knows these
roads much better than we do.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.886
My wife used to sing this song.

25:15.691 --> 25:17.824
You were right, Lucy.

25:17.826 --> 25:19.659
I don't know you.

25:19.661 --> 25:22.083
I guess what I was trying
to say back there is

25:22.086 --> 25:24.330
that I'd like to get to know you.

25:24.332 --> 25:26.633
But I understand if you don't want that.

25:31.673 --> 25:33.740
My mother used to sing this song too.

25:36.678 --> 25:39.512
Lorena would lie on
the couch humming it.

25:39.514 --> 25:42.400
Actually used to bother me.

25:42.403 --> 25:44.270
Now it's the little details like that

25:44.273 --> 25:46.186
which I miss the most...

25:46.188 --> 25:50.557
The pranks she pulled,
her icy feet at night,

25:50.559 --> 25:53.059
the smell of her hair.

25:54.696 --> 25:57.597
My sister, she had this...

25:57.599 --> 25:59.733
strawberry-scented shampoo.

25:59.735 --> 26:01.825
When we were little, she
would get scared at night,

26:01.828 --> 26:06.272
so she'd crawl into my
bed and snuggle into me,

26:06.274 --> 26:08.609
her hair right up against my nose.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.748
I'd dream all night about milkshakes.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.217
I never intended that to happen...

26:17.219 --> 26:18.752
Your sister disappearing,

26:18.754 --> 26:21.122
I... I never wanted to hurt you, Lucy.

26:22.958 --> 26:25.291
We'll never get the people
back that we love, will we?

26:25.293 --> 26:28.895
Only if we give up hope.

26:28.897 --> 26:31.564
I know somehow, someway,

26:31.566 --> 26:35.635
we'll save the people we love.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.837
You knew from my journal
that my mother sang that song,

26:37.839 --> 26:39.173
didn't you?

26:43.044 --> 26:45.445
You should know the
Lucy in that journal.

26:45.447 --> 26:47.781
She's very,

26:47.783 --> 26:50.481
very impressive.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.797
- Thanks.
- He's up there playing,

27:03.799 --> 27:05.465
with his back turned to the dancers,

27:05.467 --> 27:07.433
facing the wall like he do.

27:07.435 --> 27:10.003
Oh, that's only 'cause he
got a case of stage fright.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.437
- Stage fright?
- No, no, no,

27:11.439 --> 27:14.239
Bob don't want nobody
to learn how he frets.

27:16.211 --> 27:18.978
Two things, no one seems to
know when Robert Johnson's

27:18.980 --> 27:21.347
sister is arriving, and
I'm also a little bit

27:21.349 --> 27:23.559
worried that Lucy and Flynn
didn't got our message.

27:23.562 --> 27:25.151
Bob's corner loading,

27:25.153 --> 27:27.854
bouncing the sound off the
walls for the acoustics.

27:27.856 --> 27:30.690
Son, you can't even spell acoustics.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.458
Connor?

27:32.460 --> 27:34.027
Hey, Earth to Connor.

27:34.029 --> 27:35.547
Oh, good news, Rufus.

27:35.550 --> 27:36.739
I've figured out what I'm gonna do

27:36.741 --> 27:38.130
when we get back to the present.

27:38.133 --> 27:39.778
Really? You want to do this now?

27:39.781 --> 27:42.168
Yeah, I'm leaving.

27:42.170 --> 27:44.437
Yeah, I'm taking a
cue from Robert and...

27:46.208 --> 27:48.141
As soon as we get back,
I'll pack up my things

27:48.143 --> 27:49.853
from the bunker and just ramble on.

27:49.856 --> 27:51.356
Okay, I know you're new to this,

27:51.359 --> 27:53.146
but that's not how these missions work.

27:53.148 --> 27:55.099
They're not your life
counseling sessions.

27:55.102 --> 27:57.517
What exactly have I contributed?

27:57.519 --> 27:59.886
We only figured out Robert
was Rittenhouse's target

27:59.888 --> 28:03.122
because I was a pimply-faced
blues geek as a teen.

28:03.124 --> 28:06.025
And it worked. We're here.

28:06.027 --> 28:08.059
Look, we don't have time
for your midlife crisis.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.075
We need to find a phone, try again,

28:10.078 --> 28:12.802
or somehow get Robert
Johnson to change his mind.

28:12.805 --> 28:15.702
Now, who said my baby brother's in here?

28:15.704 --> 28:18.805
- Bob, where you at?
- Carrie?

28:18.807 --> 28:20.561
Oh!

28:20.564 --> 28:22.032
Come here!

28:24.512 --> 28:27.180
Listen, I... I got something
I've got to tell you.

28:27.182 --> 28:28.615
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:41.730 --> 28:44.631
I'm in the new location.

28:44.633 --> 28:46.232
Yeah, you're right... This looks like

28:46.234 --> 28:47.767
a Rittenhouse headquarters.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.302
Should I proceed?

28:49.304 --> 28:51.037
Rittenhouse headquarters?

28:51.039 --> 28:52.639
Maybe this is the right time for backup?

28:52.641 --> 28:54.638
I mean, Wyatt's tough,
but he's not Chuck Norris.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.509
- He'll be fine.
- How do you know that?

28:56.511 --> 28:58.583
He could get hurt, he's
by himself, he could...

28:58.586 --> 29:00.398
Jiya, if I bring in more agents

29:00.401 --> 29:02.949
and one of them's a Rittenhouse
mole, it could ruin everything.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.988
You know what else ruins
everything? Wyatt dying.

29:04.991 --> 29:06.724
He can handle it. Open the comms.

29:07.923 --> 29:10.114
Hello? What are we doing?

29:10.117 --> 29:11.758
Wyatt, you're a go.

29:57.973 --> 29:59.573
What the...

30:08.256 --> 30:11.492
They're burning the place
down, destroying the evidence.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.355
Hey!

30:18.126 --> 30:19.250
Take the shot.

30:21.495 --> 30:24.129
- You can't do it, can you?
- Take the shot.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.335
Take the shot!

30:36.141 --> 30:38.174
Emma, fire up the Mothership!

30:38.177 --> 30:39.239
Wyatt, are you all right?

30:43.350 --> 30:46.151
Wyatt? Are you okay, Wyatt?

30:48.913 --> 30:51.117
They're gone.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.197
What's the plan now?

31:03.200 --> 31:05.166
Knock him over the head,
lock him in a closet?

31:05.169 --> 31:07.130
Tell him no pudding till
he records those songs?

31:07.132 --> 31:08.865
I'm not sure we're gonna
get groundbreaking music

31:08.867 --> 31:10.867
from blunt force trauma.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.095
Well, what, then?

31:12.098 --> 31:13.764
We can't just stand here and watch.

31:13.767 --> 31:16.638
If he leaves now, he's gonna
give up the guitar for good.

31:23.481 --> 31:25.815
Hey, don't I know you?

31:29.838 --> 31:32.289
Rufus!

31:34.759 --> 31:37.493
Thank you. Thank you.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.896
It wasn't us.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.874
Johnson's still holed
up in the storage room.

31:51.876 --> 31:53.369
The sleeper killed Law.

31:53.372 --> 31:55.501
But we got your message
and brought the equipment.

31:55.504 --> 31:56.839
Yeah, well, who's supposed to work it?

31:56.841 --> 31:58.507
We were thinking maybe Mason could.

31:58.510 --> 32:00.482
Did he convince Johnson
to do the recording?

32:00.485 --> 32:02.251
No, and after what
he's just been through,

32:02.253 --> 32:03.422
I'm not sure he's gonna be able to.

32:03.424 --> 32:04.854
Rufus, you have to talk to him.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.322
He has to.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.457
We're gonna go get the equipment.

32:16.466 --> 32:18.233
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.069
So, Lucy and Flynn got the equipment.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.759
- Okay.
- We just need you to get

32:21.762 --> 32:23.495
Robert Johnson to play.

32:23.498 --> 32:25.231
All right, um,

32:25.234 --> 32:26.734
where's Don Law?

32:30.415 --> 32:32.369
He's dead.

32:32.372 --> 32:34.304
- Then it's over.
- No, you said you could

32:34.307 --> 32:36.374
- record it here.
- No, no, that was a Hail Mary.

32:36.377 --> 32:38.053
That was before Don Law was killed,

32:38.056 --> 32:40.089
before I killed someone,

32:40.091 --> 32:42.358
before I saw this place...
It's... it's all wrong.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.181
- Not if you record it.
- Yeah, me?

32:44.184 --> 32:47.095
Inferior space, inferior
acoustics, inferior producer.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.627
It won't be the same, which means

32:48.630 --> 32:50.497
it won't have the same impact.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.500
Okay, well, it's going to have to.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.269
No, you do it.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.706
I don't...

32:56.709 --> 32:58.409
you were obsessed with his music.

32:58.412 --> 32:59.976
You know how it's all supposed to sound.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.210
I don't.

33:01.212 --> 33:04.113
Fan boys don't save the world, Rufus.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.053
I was your fan boy.

33:11.055 --> 33:14.056
Oh, what are you talking about?

33:14.058 --> 33:17.426
Do you remember my senior year at MIT?

33:17.428 --> 33:19.595
I was the prodigy.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.565
Then two weeks before finals, I cracked.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.867
Days, I cried, I didn't eat,
I locked myself in a room

33:24.869 --> 33:27.103
in the dark, I was gone.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.538
You flew 16 hours from Seoul,

33:29.540 --> 33:31.540
knocked on my door with
a double cheeseburger

33:31.542 --> 33:34.244
and a milkshake to tell
me you believed in me.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.142
Hey, hey.

33:41.285 --> 33:43.752
This is me returning the favor.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.573
Guess I was wrong.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.176
Devil fell on me here too.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.945
Why did you pick up the
guitar in the first place,

34:09.947 --> 34:11.648
Robert?

34:16.721 --> 34:19.655
I wanted to be the greatest
bluesman in the world.

34:19.657 --> 34:21.857
And you are,

34:21.859 --> 34:26.395
except no one knows it
yet, and no one ever will,

34:26.397 --> 34:28.900
unless you show a little backbone.

34:28.902 --> 34:31.221
- You calling me a coward?
- No, I'm not calling you

34:31.224 --> 34:34.592
anything worse than I've called myself.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.304
I... I've done things that
most people wouldn't even

34:37.308 --> 34:40.509
consider possible. I
was rich, I was famous,

34:40.511 --> 34:44.380
I was powerful, and I lost it all.

34:44.382 --> 34:47.350
So I'm at the same
crossroads as you, Robert.

34:47.351 --> 34:52.088
But what do I do? Do I
walk away or fight back?

34:52.090 --> 34:54.223
And yes, maybe you made
a deal with the devil,

34:54.225 --> 34:56.625
and maybe you didn't,
but this bad luck...

34:56.627 --> 34:58.283
That's gonna keep chasing you

34:58.286 --> 35:02.378
until you decide to stop,

35:02.381 --> 35:05.249
stand your ground,

35:05.252 --> 35:06.619
and fight.

35:09.439 --> 35:11.306
To hell with oblivion.

35:24.888 --> 35:26.988
Right, um, just sing,

35:26.991 --> 35:29.353
clearly, into the microphone.

It's gonna take a while
to comb through the place,

36:34.862 --> 36:36.699
but if we can salvage
some of these computers,

36:36.702 --> 36:40.057
there's got to be intel here...

36:40.060 --> 36:42.327
You could've taken out Carol Preston.

36:44.998 --> 36:46.464
My gun jammed.

36:46.466 --> 36:50.201
You hesitated because
it was Lucy's mother.

36:50.203 --> 36:52.843
- Ma'am...
- Carol Preston is the enemy.

36:52.846 --> 36:54.772
Look, whatever's going
on between you and Lucy,

36:54.774 --> 36:57.643
you need to figure it out,
Wyatt, and deal with it.

36:59.479 --> 37:01.546
Yes, ma'am.

37:01.548 --> 37:04.315
I'll take it from here. Go home.

37:20.869 --> 37:22.163
Oh, my gosh, Jiya,

37:22.166 --> 37:24.101
you should've seen it. It was amazing.

37:24.104 --> 37:27.438
Mason was something truly to behold.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.674
Sounds like you guys had fun, huh?

37:29.676 --> 37:31.676
Oh, well, yeah, that
all depends, though.

37:31.678 --> 37:34.245
Were there hippies in the '60s?

37:34.247 --> 37:37.348
And a band called Led Zeppelin?

37:37.350 --> 37:38.783
Duh.

37:38.785 --> 37:40.251
- You did it.
- Nice.

37:40.253 --> 37:42.120
- You did.
- Thank you.

37:42.122 --> 37:43.355
Good job.

37:48.061 --> 37:50.396
- Thank you.
- For what?

37:53.566 --> 37:55.000
For everything.

37:57.529 --> 37:59.396
- Hey, Connor?
- Yeah?

37:59.406 --> 38:01.339
Before we left, did Robert
Johnson ever tell you

38:01.341 --> 38:03.075
what really happened at the crossroad?

38:17.290 --> 38:19.191
Lucy.

38:20.527 --> 38:22.227
Could I talk to you a minute?

38:29.569 --> 38:32.069
What did Agent Christopher have you do?

38:32.071 --> 38:34.505
We found Rittenhouse's headquarters.

38:34.507 --> 38:35.840
We hit them hard,

38:35.842 --> 38:38.075
They're on the run. I just got back.

38:38.077 --> 38:40.711
And my mother?

38:40.713 --> 38:42.847
She got away.

38:42.849 --> 38:44.248
Oh.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.883
What about Flynn?

38:45.885 --> 38:47.886
You keep him on a short leash?

38:49.656 --> 38:51.856
He was actually great.

38:51.858 --> 38:55.126
He really came through.

38:55.128 --> 38:57.241
Oh. What happened?

38:57.244 --> 38:58.577
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

38:58.580 --> 38:59.997
I'm... I'm sure Jessica's worried sick.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.299
Lucy, come on, I want to know.

39:01.301 --> 39:03.568
Tomorrow.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.536
Go, be with Jessica.

39:15.548 --> 39:17.115
Hmm.

39:52.053 --> 39:54.151
Yeah!

39:54.154 --> 39:55.679
That was my "yeah."

41:03.389 --> 41:04.789
What?

41:04.791 --> 41:07.335
Nothing, nothing.

41:07.338 --> 41:09.093
You're gonna tell me
you had one of those

41:09.095 --> 41:11.362
creepy visions again, aren't you?

41:11.364 --> 41:14.098
Premonitions. You said
you didn't want to know.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.767
Yeah well, now you have to say it.

41:16.769 --> 41:19.236
You built it up too much.

41:23.076 --> 41:25.209
It's okay.

41:25.211 --> 41:27.278
Say it.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.886
I saw you near the ocean,

41:35.888 --> 41:38.689
surrounded by cowboys, I think...

41:38.691 --> 41:41.692
Yellow teeth, spurs on their boots.

41:41.694 --> 41:44.261
They have you trapped.

41:47.734 --> 41:49.567
You died.
