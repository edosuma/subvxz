that she was gonna enjoy

No.

Safer.

15:01.016 --> 15:03.017
You know, show jumping
is dangerous enough,

15:03.051 --> 15:05.486

the back of a galloping horse

15:05.520 --> 15:07.186
with her head
two inches from the ground.

15:07.221 --> 15:10.289
Well, it is risky,
there's no doubt about that,

what she likes about it.

all the worrying.

34:05.472 --> 34:06.805
Wasn't even mad,
not even a little bit.

34:06.873 --> 34:12.277
In fact, she pretty much called
me the world's greatest dad.

34:12.312 --> 34:14.947
Well, you should put that
on a t-shirt then.

34:15.014 --> 34:18.851
You know, between Lou and Katie's
Dollhouse, I'm on a fatherhood roll, Jack.

34:18.918 --> 34:23.755
You know, actually, I've been doing
some thinking about that Dollhouse.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.690
You're Katie's grandfather,

34:25.757 --> 34:28.893
so I think you should be the one
to finish it for her.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.862
<i>It won't be as good</i>
<i>if I'm not involved,</i>

34:30.896 --> 34:32.496
<i>but it'll go a lot faster.</i>

34:32.532 --> 34:35.299
Yeah, no. No, no, no.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.067
We started together,
we finish together.

34:37.135 --> 34:41.138
Jack: Why? Whenever we do anything
together we just fight about it.

34:41.172 --> 34:43.281
Tim: Well, then, we're just gonna have
to get over ourselves, aren't we, Jack?

34:44.976 --> 34:46.577
Come on, for Katie's sake.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.148
For Katie's sake.

34:57.555 --> 34:59.955
Amy: Lou, I know you already
said no to trick riding lessons,

35:00.023 --> 35:01.724
but I think maybe
you should reconsider.

35:01.792 --> 35:03.193
I didn't say no forever.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.460
I just said to wait
until she's older.

35:04.528 --> 35:05.861
Well, how old?

35:05.929 --> 35:08.330
I don't know... Thirty-five.

35:08.398 --> 35:12.834
Lou, you can't bubble wrap Georgie and
protect her from every scrape and fall.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.937
I know, Amy, but it's trick riding and
I can't help but think of everything

35:16.005 --> 35:17.439
that could go wrong.

35:17.507 --> 35:18.840
Okay, I understand that,

35:20.643 --> 35:25.045
but Sandra is a professional and she is
gonna teach Georgie to be disciplined

35:25.113 --> 35:27.348
and not take dangerous risks.

35:27.382 --> 35:30.050
Lou, would you please
just have an open mind?

35:30.085 --> 35:32.220
I'd like to try something.

35:32.287 --> 35:33.921
[Sighs]

35:38.694 --> 35:40.827
Sandra: Nice. Good. Okay,
straighten your knees.

35:40.894 --> 35:41.561
Yeah.

35:42.763 --> 35:43.896
So how are you doing?

35:43.931 --> 35:45.632
Sandra: Great job, Georgie.

35:45.666 --> 35:49.502
I guess it's not as scary
as I thought.

35:49.537 --> 35:51.871
So much for ballet lessons.

35:51.939 --> 35:53.072
Sandra: Nice!

35:53.140 --> 35:53.806
Good.

35:56.075 --> 35:57.610
<i>Okay, are you ready?</i>

35:57.644 --> 36:00.788
Ready.

36:06.353 --> 36:08.737
Very nice! Ha!

36:11.157 --> 36:15.325
One thing's for sure, Georgie sure
didn't smile like that in dance class.

36:27.075 --> 36:29.143

36:32.946 --> 36:35.581
Jeff:
Yeah, doc said I was fine.

36:35.616 --> 36:37.350
Ty: Well, you're lucky.

36:37.385 --> 36:39.719
That stunt you pulled
was pretty stupid.

36:39.753 --> 36:41.713
Jeff: Hey, you're the one
that pulled ahead of me.

36:43.891 --> 36:45.525
Ty: Okay, then I guess
we're both pretty stupid.

36:45.559 --> 36:46.692
[Jeff and Ty chuckle playfully]

36:46.727 --> 36:48.480
Jeff: Stop!

36:49.729 --> 36:51.263
[Grunted exhale]

36:53.500 --> 36:56.201
You know, this um...

36:56.236 --> 36:59.505
This visit didn't really
turn out the way I expected.

36:59.539 --> 37:02.974
I bet you'll be real happy
to see me leave.

37:03.009 --> 37:05.309
Actually, no.

37:05.344 --> 37:07.845
I was hoping
you'd stick around.

37:07.879 --> 37:10.681
I mean, at least until you've
worked things out with Georgie.

37:10.749 --> 37:13.151
Nah, man, I've been
messing up big time.

37:15.287 --> 37:17.522
She's better off without me.

37:19.224 --> 37:21.658
I get it.

37:21.692 --> 37:24.694
I used to run away a lot too.

37:24.728 --> 37:27.564
Things would get complicated
and I'd just take off.

37:27.598 --> 37:30.099
I'd disappear.

37:30.167 --> 37:33.502
Sticking around
and working things out,

37:34.130 --> 37:35.096
it's hard.

37:37.608 --> 37:38.374
See you later.

37:50.219 --> 37:53.321
Sandra is
the coolest teacher ever!

37:53.389 --> 37:55.457
I can't believe she gave me
a private lesson.

37:55.524 --> 38:00.194
I was so scared, and I was sure I was
gonna fall off, but then I did it!

38:00.261 --> 38:01.395
Amy and Georgie: [Laugh]

38:01.463 --> 38:04.164
Jeff:
Hey, I just came to say goodbye.

38:06.101 --> 38:07.902
I thought you already left.

38:07.970 --> 38:10.037
No, I'm heading out
tomorrow morning.

38:11.439 --> 38:12.573
Okay. Bye.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.978
Amy: Georgie...
Jeff: No, no, no, it's okay.

38:18.045 --> 38:22.548
She's mad at me 'cause I screwed
up our plans yesterday.

38:22.617 --> 38:25.184
You know, I meant what I said,
Georgie.

38:25.252 --> 38:27.887
I'm gonna make it up to you,
okay?

38:27.955 --> 38:31.491
Maybe if I get some vacation time,
<i>I'll come back at Christmas.</i>

38:34.527 --> 38:36.662
I'll call you when I get home,
okay?

38:38.431 --> 38:39.798
See you around, squirt.

38:44.203 --> 38:47.372
Lou: Georgie, that
wasn't very nice,

38:47.440 --> 38:50.341
especially considering
he came all this way to see you.

38:50.408 --> 38:53.577
I know, but...
I guess I just thought

38:53.646 --> 38:56.313
I'd get to spend
more time with him.

38:56.348 --> 38:58.616
But he's too busy.

38:58.651 --> 39:00.885
Yeah, but you're busy too.

39:00.919 --> 39:03.754
The important thing
is your brother is here,

39:03.788 --> 39:06.857
and he may not be perfect,
but he's trying.

39:11.614 --> 39:12.180
Amy: Hey,

39:14.799 --> 39:17.500
you know who this girl is
in the picture with Sandra?

39:17.535 --> 39:18.669
<i>Georgie: No.</i>

39:18.703 --> 39:20.870
<i>Amy: Well, her name's Diana.</i>

39:20.937 --> 39:23.472
She's Sandra's sister.

39:23.506 --> 39:28.310
They used to perform together and
they were absolutely amazing.

39:28.344 --> 39:31.416
But Diana passed away
a few years ago.

39:32.758 --> 39:33.924
That's awful.

39:34.785 --> 39:39.788
You know, Georgie, sometimes we think
we have all the time in the world

39:39.822 --> 39:44.159
with the people we care about,
but the truth is, we don't.

39:45.728 --> 39:47.162
[Exhales, thoughtful]

<i>Jeff: Hey, what are you
doing with my bike?</i>

40:00.380 --> 40:03.248
Ty: Fixing it, and
you're gonna help.

40:03.283 --> 40:06.585
You wanna learn how to ride a
motorcycle, you gotta respect it,

40:06.619 --> 40:09.921
and that starts
with knowing how it works.

40:09.989 --> 40:12.324
Are you in or are you out?

40:12.358 --> 40:13.824
Yeah, sure.

40:13.858 --> 40:15.493
All right.

40:15.527 --> 40:17.562
I know you gotta get to fort
Mac, so we'll work fast.

40:17.629 --> 40:19.363
Uh, actually, um...

40:19.398 --> 40:21.965
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.305
I'm gonna stick around for a bit, see if
I can patch things up with my sister.

40:27.339 --> 40:28.739
Good. That's good.

40:30.908 --> 40:32.942
Okay, we're gonna start
with the brake lever.

40:32.976 --> 40:34.744
Jeff: Okay...

40:34.778 --> 40:36.818
Jeff: Yeah, screw's up here.
Ty: Yeah, that's right.

40:39.049 --> 40:40.717

make it look like the house.
