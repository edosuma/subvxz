00:04.086 --> 00:05.853
Here you go.

00:05.921 --> 00:08.856
Thanks. Say,                    
aren't you Sam Malone?

00:08.924 --> 00:10.358
Guilty as charged.

00:10.426 --> 00:12.927
Small world.                    
Marge Thornhill here.

00:12.995 --> 00:14.996
Don't you remember me?

00:15.063 --> 00:17.715
Ah, boy, you know,          
 I can't quite place the face.

00:17.783 --> 00:19.483
Where'd we meet?

00:19.551 --> 00:22.270
Well, we didn't actually meet, 
 but I know you'll remember me.

00:22.338 --> 00:25.407
I went to every home game       
        you ever played.

00:25.474 --> 00:27.509
Uh... Marge,

00:27.576 --> 00:30.311
there are a lot of people       
    up in the stands there.

00:30.379 --> 00:32.162
Sure, but you got           
        to remember me.

00:32.229 --> 00:34.198
I always sat          
    right behind first base,

00:34.266 --> 00:36.167
five rows up, remember?

00:36.234 --> 00:37.719
I used to get there,

00:37.786 --> 00:40.255
early so I could watch you      
    warm up in the bullpen.

00:40.322 --> 00:42.990
I'm sorry.

00:43.058 --> 00:45.793
I know,             
you couldn't forget this.

00:45.861 --> 00:49.480
Hey, Malone!          
You pitch like my sister!

00:49.548 --> 00:52.934
Why don't you go home      
    and make a dress!

00:55.804 --> 00:57.038
Was that you?

00:57.106 --> 00:57.973
Yeah.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.358
Well, how have you been?

01:00.426 --> 01:01.509
Guys, I want you to...

01:01.576 --> 01:03.611
Do the one where you say    
    I couldn't get the ball

01:03.678 --> 01:05.746
across the plate        
 if I drove it there in my car.

01:05.814 --> 01:08.616
No, no, that was then,     
        and this is now.

01:08.683 --> 01:10.385
By the way, I'm really sorry

01:10.452 --> 01:12.787
for all those shots       
I gave you over the years.

01:12.854 --> 01:14.122
No hard feelings?

01:14.189 --> 01:16.724
No, of course not.          
It's all part of the game.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.760
You're a real sport, Malone.

01:18.827 --> 01:20.462

01:21.464 --> 01:23.665
You call this a martini?!

01:24.750 --> 01:28.319
What'd you use for vermouth,  
          turpentine?!

01:29.154 --> 01:32.173
The great ones never lose it.

All right, I got it,    
                 I got it.

02:18.103 --> 02:19.737
The worst possible      
              way to die?       
                         Mm-hmm.

02:19.805 --> 02:21.439
Being eaten alive   
                by rats.

02:21.507 --> 02:23.908
No. I think I can do
             better than that.

02:23.975 --> 02:25.660
I'd say the worst way to die

02:25.728 --> 02:28.530
is to be sliding down      
    a razor banister, okay?

A <i>greased</i> razor banister.

FRASIER:            
    Wait, I've got it.

02:31.466 --> 02:34.002
To die alone,

02:34.069 --> 02:37.688
knowing that you        
     have never been loved.

02:37.756 --> 02:40.475
Come on, Frasier, if you're not 
even gonna try... Come on.

02:41.977 --> 02:44.979
Ooh, Carla, what are you
             all decked out for?

02:45.047 --> 02:46.614
It's my second                  
wedding anniversary.

02:46.681 --> 02:48.983
Oh. Things are 
                 going okay with
                 you and Eddie?

02:49.051 --> 02:50.251
I mean,

02:50.319 --> 02:51.953
just last week,         
      you were calling him

02:52.020 --> 02:53.588
a "dent-nosed, toothless    
         little frog."

02:53.656 --> 02:55.623
Pillow talk.

02:55.691 --> 02:57.058
Ah.

02:57.126 --> 02:59.026
Well, actually,         
I was a little upset there

02:59.095 --> 03:02.029
about the fact that he's been  
 on the road with the ice show

03:02.098 --> 03:04.165
for a month now,        
      and I haven't gotten

03:04.233 --> 03:05.700
so much as a phone call.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.136
But this morning, I suddenly  
  realized what he was doing.

03:08.204 --> 03:09.471
Treating you like crap?

03:09.538 --> 03:13.641
No. No, that's what       
     he wants me to think.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.610
It's way of setting up     
          a surprise.

03:15.677 --> 03:17.878
So you figure he's              
been neglecting you             
just to set you up.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.864
It's got to be that--      
        I know this man.

03:19.931 --> 03:21.298
Woody, what time is it?

03:21.367 --> 03:23.568
Oh, don't go by <i>my</i> watch--
                 I always set it

03:23.635 --> 03:25.803
ten minutes ahead so I
    won't be late for things.

03:25.871 --> 03:27.705
You were late this morning.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.941
Yeah, I know.          
I couldn't find my watch.

03:31.093 --> 03:32.927
It's, uh, 6:30, Carla.

03:32.995 --> 03:36.280
Well, he's still got
            five and a half more
            hours till midnight.

03:36.348 --> 03:38.382
Yeah, he's really   
            cutting it close.

03:38.450 --> 03:41.085
But it'll make it   
                all the sweeter 
            when it happens.

03:41.153 --> 03:44.321
Yeah, anniversaries
             can be just great.

03:44.389 --> 03:46.607
I'll never forget           
my first anniversary with Vera.

03:46.675 --> 03:49.110
Yeah, we, uh...

03:49.178 --> 03:51.579
Oh, my God, I did forget it.

03:51.647 --> 03:55.350
Anybody know where I can get  
  a 17-year-old box of candy?

03:55.418 --> 03:58.386
Frasier, my fawn,           
    I deserve a treat.

03:58.454 --> 04:02.023
Today my belly button turned    
from an innie to an outie.

Uh, Norm? We have

04:05.494 --> 04:08.196
a few things we'd like          
to ask you about.               
              Oh, great. Must be

04:08.263 --> 04:10.882
pretty important if you're      
willing to buy me a free drink.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.233
Oh, of course we will.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.468
A drink for Norm? 
              What do you drink?

04:14.537 --> 04:17.005

04:18.673 --> 04:20.141
What's so funny?

04:20.208 --> 04:21.442
It's just that everyone knows

04:21.510 --> 04:23.177
Norm always drinks beer,        
dearest.

04:23.245 --> 04:25.212
Ah. That <i>is</i> hysterical.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.315
Anyway, Lilith and I

04:28.383 --> 04:30.384
have been talking,          
    and we have decided that

04:30.452 --> 04:32.520
we would like you to decorate  
    our unborn child's room.

04:32.588 --> 04:34.388
All right!              
      Sure, I can do that.

04:34.456 --> 04:36.257
I just did a nursery       
     for my sister-in-law.

04:36.325 --> 04:37.625
I went with

04:37.692 --> 04:39.243
Gummy Bears rampant       
     in a field of Smurfs.

04:39.311 --> 04:40.745
Oh, no, no, no.

04:40.813 --> 04:44.281
We'd like to stay away from that
cutesie-ootsie drivel that

04:44.349 --> 04:47.668
retards the child's creative   
 and intellectual development.

04:47.736 --> 04:51.072
All right, uh, do we know if  
 it's gonna be a boy or a girl?

04:51.139 --> 04:54.008
We are not going to cram sexual 
identity down our baby's throat.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.677
So, naturally,

04:55.745 --> 04:58.212
the room should be,       
     oh, sexually neutral.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.848
Good. Fine, I can do that.

04:59.915 --> 05:01.649
When I'm finished,        
      your kid won't have

05:01.717 --> 05:03.251
a clue what sex it is.

05:05.621 --> 05:06.888
Hey, everybody, listen up.

05:06.955 --> 05:09.491
We only got a few minutes       
    to the game here.

05:09.558 --> 05:11.325

    on the basketball pool?

I'm in! Put me down! Yeah!

05:13.729 --> 05:15.196
There you go, gentlemen.

05:15.264 --> 05:17.164
Woody, how about you?

05:17.232 --> 05:19.751
Oh, I don't know, Sam, I don't 
 like playing games for money.

05:19.818 --> 05:23.354
You end up either losing money  
or taking it from your friends.

05:23.421 --> 05:25.406
No, no, Woody,         
this is just a game, man.

05:25.474 --> 05:26.907
You know, five bucks a square.

05:26.975 --> 05:29.910
You got four quarters,     
      four chances to win.

05:29.978 --> 05:32.913
I don't know, I don't like      
 taking money from my friends.

05:32.981 --> 05:37.218
Aw, go ahead, Woody-- 
        nobody here gives a     
          hoot about you anyway.

05:38.019 --> 05:40.371
Okay, great.

05:42.174 --> 05:43.474
It's just money.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.910
This isn't
                gambling, is it?
        Gambling?

05:45.978 --> 05:47.979
Sam, we have had    
            this talk before.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.747
I can get   
                  closed down.

05:49.815 --> 05:51.983
This? Oh, no, no.           
            Thanks.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.685
This is not gambling,      
         this is, uh...

05:54.753 --> 05:55.887
well, this is a game.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.822
Uh, haven't you ever heard      
            of, uh,

05:57.890 --> 05:59.456
Championship Tic-tac-toe?

05:59.524 --> 06:01.309
It's a game.

06:01.376 --> 06:02.643
Uh, who's next here?       
                         Me. Me.

06:02.711 --> 06:04.012
All righty.           
                It's my turn.

06:04.079 --> 06:07.665
And I will take 
            this square here.

06:07.733 --> 06:10.467
And, uh... Oh, 
                by the way, Sam,

06:10.536 --> 06:12.870
here's that five
                bucks I owe you.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.393
Ah, well, Normie, you, uh,

06:18.460 --> 06:21.195
you fell right into       
     my trap there, buddy.

06:21.263 --> 06:23.097
CLIFF:
                    Here you go.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.648
Oh, Sammy, by the way,          
this, uh,

06:24.716 --> 06:27.151
slipped out of your wallet      
a couple of weeks ago.          
                            Oh!

06:27.219 --> 06:29.787
REBECCA:            
 How stupid do you think I am?

06:29.854 --> 06:31.255
I know exactly

06:31.323 --> 06:32.590
what's going on here.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.559
Come on, what's
                  the big deal?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.761
It's just a friendly        
    little game of wagering.

06:36.828 --> 06:38.929
It's a simple $500 pot.

06:38.997 --> 06:41.599
I can't believe         
          you people.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.767
Do you really think
                you're gonna get
          something for nothing?

06:43.835 --> 06:48.789
Do you know how long
    it takes me to earn $500?

06:48.857 --> 06:51.292
Give me three squares.

06:53.362 --> 06:56.514
Hey, guys, get a load 
          of that guy over there

06:56.582 --> 06:59.199
with the fake beard 
        and the dark glasses.

06:59.267 --> 07:01.485
Does that look like
         somebody I'm married to

07:01.553 --> 07:04.021
in a special
        anniversary disguise?

07:04.089 --> 07:07.992
Well, two can play
        at the surprise game.

07:12.330 --> 07:13.998
Your beard might be phony,

07:14.066 --> 07:18.035
but I know something            
about you that's real.

07:18.103 --> 07:20.638
Wait a minute.                  
You're not Eddie.

07:23.475 --> 07:26.444
But you're not bad.

07:31.049 --> 07:32.533
( <i>sighs</i> ):
                 Where is Eddie?

07:32.601 --> 07:35.903
Why haven't I 
                 heard from him?

07:35.971 --> 07:39.323
It's dear to see Carla so   
    concerned about her mate.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.442
Do you remember   
             when you gave that 
            lecture in New York,

07:41.510 --> 07:43.944
and in a fit of whimsy, I   
    flew in to surprise you?

07:44.012 --> 07:47.398
It was hardly a surprise;       
we booked those reservations    
three weeks in advance.

07:47.466 --> 07:51.536
So you were in on 
             it-- still it was a
             wacky thing to do.

07:51.603 --> 07:54.572
( <i>TV sports announcer talking</i> )
             Hey, Sam,          
      end of the first quarter.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.407

Uh-oh. Woody.

What a shame--                  
I know how he feels

08:04.967 --> 08:07.101

of his friends' money here.

from parental embraces,

that people hate worse

is a guy who                    
stands there smug

when they know that             
he's gloating on the inside.

I really hope there isn't       
  any gambling going on here.

Gambling?

17:00.935 --> 17:02.836
No, sir.

17:02.904 --> 17:04.637
I earned this money.

I'm a prostitute.

That isn't better, is it?

Um, no, this

and I give the money back       
        like this.

No brakes in the car.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.893
How does he stop?

Well, he either swerves         
into hedges

or he coasts                    
around the block

until he can stop the car       
with his foot.

Yeah, once a month, but...

this has got to be              
some kind of joke.

I mean, he wouldn't send it     
on our anniversary.

my typical creep husband.

They changed the whole script

    out of the big bad wolf,

they're God's gift to ice.

    to talk about it.

 when am I gonna see you again?

Well, turns out the only reason 
     he didn't surprise me

21:30.704 --> 21:31.905
was he had to rehearse.
