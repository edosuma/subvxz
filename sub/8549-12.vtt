00:09.577 --> 00:12.646
YEAH. I LIKE

00:12.713 --> 00:14.282
GOOD IDEA.

00:14.348 --> 00:18.252
MOM, HOW COME SOME PEOPLE
ARE BLACK AND WHITE OR BROWN.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.256
WELL, HONEY,

00:22.323 --> 00:25.793

00:33.033 --> 00:36.237

00:37.071 --> 00:38.072
JANET LAYTHROW?

00:38.139 --> 00:40.040
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.242
MILDRED PEABODY?

00:41.309 --> 00:45.646
SHE'S NO WAY NEAR

00:45.713 --> 00:48.182
HELLO, ESTELLE. READY TO HIT

00:48.249 --> 00:49.683

00:56.557 --> 00:59.127
HONEY, HE'S A TERRIBLE PLAYER.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.662
BUT, UH, HE'S GOOD ENOUGH.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.766
GET OUTTA HERE.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.613

IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:19.680 --> 01:23.317
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS

01:23.384 --> 01:26.620

* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:50.110 --> 01:54.215
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE

02:36.957 --> 02:37.925
HEY, SWEETIE.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.760
HI, CARL.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.861
MMM...

02:40.928 --> 02:42.095
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.632
GREAT. I HAD A STAKEOUT
AT DOUGHNUT WORLD.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.036
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

02:49.102 --> 02:50.504
OH, FINE...

02:50.571 --> 02:53.241
UNTIL JUDY'S TEACHER
CALLED ME AT WORK.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.244
WHO, MRS. FUZZLIP?

02:56.310 --> 02:58.412
CARL, IT'S MRS. FEZLIK.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.682
BAD ENOUGH THE KIDS
CALL HER FUZZLIP.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.751
BUT, HARRIETTE,
YOU'VE SEEN HER.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.587
IF EVER THERE WAS A LIP
BEGGING FOR ELECTROLYSIS...

03:09.690 --> 03:10.524
I'M SORRY.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.427
SO WHAT DID
FUZZLIP WANT?

03:13.494 --> 03:16.163
SEEMS JUDY HASN'T BEEN
DOING HER BOOK REPORTS.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.699
SHE'S HEADING
FOR A "D" IN ENGLISH.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.801
A "D"? WHERE IS SHE?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.169
UPSTAIRS.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.472
HEY, CARL,
CARL, CARL.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.574
I WANT YOU
TO BRING UP
THE SUBJECT...

03:26.640 --> 03:27.908
DELICATELY.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.410
YOU'RE RIGHT,
SWEETHEART.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.511
[SHOUTING]
JUDY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL US

03:30.578 --> 03:32.380
YOU'RE GETTING
FLUNKED BY FUZZLIP?

03:35.148 --> 03:37.050
GET YOU BACK.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.753
WATCH THE RIGHT.
WATCH IT.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.522
HEY, HEY, HEY.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.168
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BEAT ME
19 GAMES OF POOL.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.738
ACTUALLY, IT WAS 20.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.775
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.044
LET'S SEE...

04:04.111 --> 04:06.714
20 GAMES
AT A BUCK EACH.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.448
YOU OWE ME--

04:07.515 --> 04:09.016
$20.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.753
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.489
YOU LUCKED OUT
THIS TIME.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.525
NEXT TIME, I'M GOING
TO WHIP YOU.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.594
RODNEY, TRY TO GET
YOUR OARS NEAR THE WATER.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.829
WHEN IT COMES TO POOL,

04:21.895 --> 04:25.899
YOU COULDN'T SINK
THE TITANIC.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.404
CAN I HURT HIM?
NOT IN
THE HOUSE.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.275
COME ON OUTSIDE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.345
UH-UH.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.284
HI!

04:44.352 --> 04:45.285
SNOOKUMS!

04:45.353 --> 04:47.721
OH, BYE.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.091
LAURA, I NEED YOUR
ADVICE ON SOMETHING.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.994
I'M THINKING
ABOUT SWITCHING
TO BIKINI BRIEFS.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.534
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.904
I'LL JUST STICK WITH
MY TRUSTY OLD BOXERS.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.708
HEY, WHAT'S UP,
DUDES?

05:07.775 --> 05:12.513
DON'T YOU LOVE IT
WHEN THE BIG GUY
TRIES TO ACT HIP?

05:12.580 --> 05:16.016
DAD, I JUST
FINISHED PLAYING
POOL WITH RODNEY.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.685
I WIPED THE FLOOR
WITH HIM.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.919
ALRIGHT!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.288
LIKE FATHER,
LIKE SON.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.823
YOU PLAYED POOL?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.324
DID I PLAY POOL?

05:24.392 --> 05:26.594
SON, DOWN AT
THE CORNER POCKET,

05:26.660 --> 05:30.831
THEY USED TO CALL ME
"RACK 'N' ROLL" WINSLOW.

05:30.898 --> 05:34.635
WELL, THEY CALL ME
"FAST EDDIE."

05:34.702 --> 05:36.970
AND I
JUST TOOK RODNEY
FOR 20 BIG ONES.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.174
SON, I DON'T WANT
YOU GAMBLING.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.476
TRUST ME, CARL.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.245
WITH RODNEY,
IT'S NOT GAMBLING.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.780
RIGHT, EDDO?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.582
RIGHT.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.078
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE
TOO YOUNG TO BE IN HERE!

06:20.981 --> 06:23.917
THAT IS,
WITHOUT OUR WIVES.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.122
URKEL, JUST KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.691
OH, THESE LIPS ARE ZIPPED.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.567
WHOO-EE!

06:39.633 --> 06:42.402
THESE FELLAS KNOW HOW
TO USE THAT WOODEN STICK.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.471
YEAH.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.738
YOU PLAY?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.207
I PLAYED
A SPELL BACK HOME.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.509
WHERE'S THAT?

06:48.576 --> 06:51.111
BULL WATER, TEXAS.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.145
BULL WATER?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.647
YEP. TINY PLACE.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.950
IF YOU LAY DOWN,
YOUR FEET ARE
IN ANOTHER TOWN.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.223
STOP! ANOTHER
ONE LIKE THAT,

07:03.290 --> 07:05.593
AND I'LL
PROBABLY WET
MY BOXERS.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.899
YOU WANT TO
PLAY A GAME?

07:11.965 --> 07:15.202
SURE. THAT'S RIGHT
NEIGHBORLY OF YOU.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.170
EVER PLAY FOR MONEY?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.539
OH, GOSH, NO.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.441
WELL, THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.312
SHUCKS, WHY NOT?

07:25.378 --> 07:26.547

07:32.219 --> 07:33.186
EDDIE.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.388
I'M RODNEY.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.491
MY FRIENDS
CALL ME RODMEISTER.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.092
AND I'M STEVE URKEL.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.028
I DON'T GET MANY CALLS.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.232
RACK 'EM, STEVE.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.600
RACKING.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.539
LET'S MAKE IT
EIGHTBALL,

07:51.605 --> 07:53.173
5 BUCKS A GAME.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.708
OKLE-DOKLE.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.882
BUST 'EM UP.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.159
IT'S FINE!
IT'S FINE!

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
EIGHTBALL,
SIDE POCKET.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.144
YEAH!

08:31.211 --> 08:32.613
FIVE GAMES IN A ROW.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.981
LET'S FLASH SOME CASH.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.918
HOW ABOUT WE
RAISE THE STAKES--
$25 A GAME?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.286
UH-OH.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.958
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.996
EDDIE,
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S KIND OF ODD

08:49.062 --> 08:51.364
THAT HE WANTS TO
RAISE THE STAKES

08:51.431 --> 08:53.533
AFTER LOSING
FIVE GAMES?

08:53.601 --> 08:54.702
STEVE...

08:54.768 --> 08:56.536
HE JUST WANTS
TO GET HIS MONEY BACK.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.871
COULD BE.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.408
OR THE HOODWINKEE
HAS BECOME
THE HOODWINKOR.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.612
THAT TEXAS BOY
IS HANDING YOU A
LINE OF BULL WATER.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.380
GO HOME.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.115
BUT--

09:08.181 --> 09:10.651
GO HOME, STEVE.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.453
I WON'T STAND HERE
AND TAKE THAT
FROM YOU.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.755
I'M GOING HOME.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.728
LET'S DO IT.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.767
THIS LITTLE BITTY
POCKET HERE.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.638
YEAH!

09:31.839 --> 09:34.875
WELL, COUSIN,
I'M UP 10 GAMES.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.145
LOOKS LIKE
YOU OWE ME $250.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.180
TIME
TO SETTLE UP.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.581
NOW?

09:41.649 --> 09:43.884
NO. LET'S WAIT
TILL MY BIRTHDAY.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.422
EDDIE, I DON'T THINK
THIS GUY'S FROM TEXAS.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.660
YOU'RE A QUICK STUDY,
RODMEISTER.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.728
AND I WANT
THE BREAD NOW.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.863
YOU SEE, WHEN I PLAY,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.666
IT'S CASH OR CARRY.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.369
GIVE ME THE CASH...

10:02.435 --> 10:05.372
OR GET CARRIED OUT.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.074
I'M TEMPORARILY
TAPPED OUT,

10:07.140 --> 10:10.343
SO HOW'S ABOUT
I BRING YOU
THE MONEY TOMORROW?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.014
OKAY

10:14.815 --> 10:17.184
JUST ONE THING--
CHUCKIE!

10:18.151 --> 10:19.653
EDDIE WINSLOW...

10:20.788 --> 10:23.123
263 PINEHURST,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.659
555-6278,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.928
FATHER--CARL.
MOTHER--HARRIETTE.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.164
YOUNGER SISTER JUDY
ON HER WAY TO A "D"
IN ENGLISH.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.436
SO, WINSLOW,
YOU GOT A CHOICE--

10:36.503 --> 10:38.171
SHOW UP WITH
THE MONEY TOMORROW,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.941
OR STAY HOME AND
WATCH YOUR BODY HEAL.

10:53.620 --> 10:57.891
RODNEY, WHERE
AM I GOING
TO FIND $239?

10:57.958 --> 11:02.863
240, 260,
280, 300.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.604
SO, STEVE, BABY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.141
I'M GOING TO
BUY A TELESCOPE.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.709
A TELESCOPE?

11:15.776 --> 11:19.479
SOMETIMES I FORGET
WHO I'M TALKING TO.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.915
A TELESCOPE
IS A LONG TUBE

11:21.982 --> 11:24.985
THAT LETS ME
LOOK AT THINGS
REAL FAR AWAY.

11:28.989 --> 11:32.025
AND A FIST IS
A BUNCH OF FINGERS

11:32.092 --> 11:35.128
THAT LETS ME
KNOCK AN URKEL
REAL FAR AWAY.

11:37.364 --> 11:41.869
UH, SO, STEVE,
COULD YOU LEND ME $239?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.270
NOW, WHY IN
SAM HILL SHOULD I?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.141
EDDIE LOST IT
PLAYING POOL
WITH THAT GUY.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.044
IF HE DOESN'T
SHOW UP WITH A
FISTFUL OF CASH,

11:51.111 --> 11:53.280
HIS FACE
GETS POUNDED.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.448
AHA.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.485
SO YOU GOT HUSTLED...

11:58.551 --> 12:01.454
TAKEN, FLEECED, CONNED--

12:01.521 --> 12:04.324
OKAY, STEVE,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.725
I SEEM TO REMEMBER

12:05.793 --> 12:09.329
A HIGH-PITCHED,
NASAL VOICE OF REASON

12:09.396 --> 12:12.665
TRYING TO WARN YOU
OF YOUR IMPENDING FOLLY,

12:12.732 --> 12:15.368
BUT DID YOU
HEED MY ADVICE?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.537
NO, SIR!

12:17.604 --> 12:18.571
FORGET IT, STEVE!

12:18.638 --> 12:21.541
I'LL LOAN YOU
THE MONEY.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.844
HEY! THANKS.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.779
ON TWO CONDITIONS.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.549
ONE--I GO TO THE POOL HALL
WITH YOU.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.517
NO SWEAT.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.985
AND TWO--

12:32.052 --> 12:34.454
YOU HAVE TO BE MY VERY
BEST BUDDY FOR A WEEK.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.325
A DAY?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.928
DEAD MEN DON'T BARGAIN.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.397
A WEEK IT IS...

12:44.464 --> 12:45.799
PAL.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.872
UH, STEVE?

12:51.939 --> 12:52.873
WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.207
THE CORNER POCKET.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.409
YOUR SHIFT STARTS
IN FIVE MINUTES.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.544
IF I DON'T GO,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.313
SOME GUY'S GOING
TO TAP-DANCE
ON EDDIE'S FACE.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.049
EXCUSE ME?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.116
UH...

13:03.183 --> 13:05.718
YOU PROBABLY WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT,

13:05.785 --> 13:08.188
SO AMNESIA'S
THE WORD, OKAY?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.322
WHAT?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.092
GOOD!

13:26.773 --> 13:27.841
HOW'S THE BOOK?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.844
BORING. LOOK HOW BIG
AND THICK IT IS.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.083
"SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON."

13:36.149 --> 13:39.119
WHO WANTS TO READ
ABOUT CHEESE?

13:39.186 --> 13:41.855
I CAN SEE WHERE THAT
COULD BE A PROBLEM.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.956
SOME READING IS BORING.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.491
I READ A BOOK

13:44.557 --> 13:48.528
WHERE THIS FAMILY
WAS STRANDED
ON A DESERTED ISLAND.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.397
THAT'S NOT BORING.
THAT'S NEAT.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.433
THEN THEY BUILT
THIS BIG TREE HOUSE--

13:53.500 --> 13:56.236
WOW! WHAT BOOK IS THAT?

13:56.303 --> 13:57.470
THIS ONE.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.107
BUT YOU'RE
NOT INTERESTED.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.308
MOM!

14:06.313 --> 14:09.816
HEY, HOW'S
THE READING GOING?

14:09.883 --> 14:12.252
I GOT A FEELING
IT'S COMING ALONG.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.566
WINSLOW,
YOU SHOWED UP.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.700
WHERE'S THE BREAD?

14:27.767 --> 14:31.138
RIGHT HERE.
250 BUCKS, BUCK.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.307
OR YOU CAN PLAY ME,
DOUBLE OR NOTHING.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.077
STEVE,
GIVE HIM THE MONEY.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.379
SURE...
IF HE'S CHICKEN.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.250
WHAT?

14:43.316 --> 14:46.386
I SAID,
IF YOU'RE CHICKEN.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.460
EIGHTBALL.
OKAY

14:53.526 --> 14:55.195
ONE GAME.
YOU'RE ON.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.396
$500.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.098
BAD BREATH.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.435
STEVE.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.570
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.072
FEAR NOT, BIG E.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.840
I PLAY A PLETHORA
OF POOL WHEN I HAVE
TIME TO MYSELF,

15:07.907 --> 15:10.277
WHICH IS QUITE OFTEN.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.248
I'LL BREAK.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.985
MAY WE BOTH RISE
TO THE CHALLENGE
THAT AWAITS US.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.020
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.194
MISSED
BY A CAT'S HAIR.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.129
HEARTY GOOD TRY, THOUGH.

15:29.196 --> 15:33.233
YOU SEE, POOL
IS A GAME OF ANGLES.

15:34.467 --> 15:38.338
ONE MUST CUE
AT AN ANGLE
TO THE OBJECT BALL

15:38.405 --> 15:43.276
SO THAT IT TRAVELS
IN THE SAME ANGLE
TO THE IMPACT POINT.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.113
LET'S SEE...

15:46.179 --> 15:48.281
AN 82-DEGREE ANGLE

15:48.348 --> 15:51.684
INTERSECTED BY
A 42-DEGREE VECTOR...

15:51.751 --> 15:54.054
LET'S SEE...
CUE BALL VELOCITY,

15:54.121 --> 15:57.057
JUPITER'S IN RETROGRADE...

15:57.124 --> 15:58.291
HARVEST MOON...

15:58.358 --> 15:58.858
SHOOT!

15:58.925 --> 16:00.193
SHOOTING.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.666
ALRIGHT!

16:06.733 --> 16:08.601
BRING IT HOME, MAMA.

16:14.074 --> 16:18.145
THE ROGUE'S ON THE RUN,
AND I'VE GOT THE GUN.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.760
NICE SHOT, MY MAN.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.733
SORRY.

16:44.104 --> 16:48.275
AH, YES. I'M PERFECTLY
SET UP TO RUN THE TABLE.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.143
THOSE ARE
MAJOR GLASSES.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.045
MIND IF
I CHECK THEM OUT?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.147
OH, WHY,
HELP YOURSELF.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.083
I WAS CONSIDERING
CONTACTS,

16:56.149 --> 16:59.086
BUT MY EYEBALLS WON'T
SUPPORT THE WEIGHT.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.522
SORRY.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.359
OOPS.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.861
HEY, THAT WAS
NO ACCIDENT.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.763
LEAVE THE KID ALONE.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.499
SURE.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.201
YOUR SHOT.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.340
I CAN'T
SEE A THING.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.842
TOUGH BREAK.
YOU FORFEIT.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.043
PAY UP.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.580
NO CAN DO. YOU DIDN'T
PLAY FAIRSIES.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.485
YOU WANT I SHOULD
GIVE HIM A TOUR
OF THE ALLEY?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.221
PLEASE.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.890
I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I FORGOT MY CAMERA.

17:37.957 --> 17:38.925
HEY!

17:38.991 --> 17:40.293
LET HIM GO.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.895
HEY, YOU GUYS,
BE GENTLE.
COME ON, GUYS.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.498
HEY, CAN'T WE
TALK THIS OVER?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.347
WHAT A LOUSY TOUR!
I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

18:01.681 --> 18:03.416
PUT HIM DOWN.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.317
CARL?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.852
YES,
IT'S ME, STEVE.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.254
BIG GUY!

18:09.021 --> 18:11.358
WAIT. I SMELL POLIDENT.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.227
HI, ESTELLE.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.130
HELLO, STEVE.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.632
DAD, HOW DID YOU
KNOW WE WERE HERE?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.634
STEVE TOLD
YOUR AUNT RACHEL.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.571
SO, UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:24.637 --> 18:25.438
BOYD WHIPPED EDDIE,

18:25.505 --> 18:26.939
EDDIE BORROWED
MONEY FROM ME,

18:27.006 --> 18:28.441
I'M PLAYING BOYD,

18:28.508 --> 18:30.543
BOYD
BROKE MY GLASSES,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.480
500 ON THE LINE,
CAN'T SEE A DARN THING.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.287
NICE SUMMARY.

18:41.688 --> 18:45.625
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO FILL IN.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.161
NO WAY. IT'S NOT FAIR.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.362
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME

18:49.429 --> 18:51.464
IF I LOOK
AROUND HARD ENOUGH,

18:51.531 --> 18:55.034
I COULD FIND
A FEW LAWS BEING
BROKEN AROUND HERE.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.803
YOU HAVE A CHOICE--

18:56.869 --> 18:58.505
YOU CAN LET ME FILL IN,

18:58.571 --> 19:02.875
OR YOU CAN GO
TO COOK COUNTY JAIL.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.411
YOU GOT STRIPES.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
THANKS.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.279
OH, YES...

19:06.346 --> 19:07.814
AND IF I WIN,

19:07.880 --> 19:11.251
NOBODY OWES NOBODY.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.635
HURT 'EM, BIG GUY.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.909
YEAH!

19:39.379 --> 19:42.114
THAT NEXT SHOT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.651
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN MAKE THAT.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.985
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:46.052 --> 19:49.222
BUT, UH...SHE WILL.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.524
DO YOUR STUFF, MAMA.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.441
EXCUSE ME.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.609
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.911
I CAN STAND
WHERE I WANT.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.513
SUIT YOURSELF.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.655
I THINK
I'LL MOVE NOW.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.594
CORNER POCKET.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.817
OH, MAN.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.586
DAD, IF YOU AND GRANDMA
HADN'T SHOWN UP,

20:53.653 --> 20:57.590
I'D PROBABLY BE FLOSSING
FELT OUT OF MY TEETH.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.327
WELL, YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
IN THAT PREDICAMENT.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.295
DIDN'T I WARN YOU
ABOUT GAMBLING?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.264
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
I COULD BEAT HIM.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.999
SEE, THERE YOU GO.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.402
WHEN IT COMES
TO GAMBLING,

21:09.469 --> 21:11.604
THERE'S
NO SUCH THING
AS A SURE THING.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.240
THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT GAMBLING.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.175
MY POOL-PLAYING DAYS
ARE OVER.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.277
I'M TAKING
AN EARLY RETIREMENT.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.013
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT, EDWARD.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.215
YOU'RE
GOOD AT THE GAME.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.117
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T
PLAY FOR MONEY.

21:25.184 --> 21:29.656
REMEMBER--YOU MAY
BE GOOD, BUT THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMEBODY BETTER.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.224
EXCEPT WHEN
IT COMES TO DADS.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.092
YOU'RE THE CHAMP.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.761
AW, THANKS.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.535
LOOK OUT, NOW.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.543
DAD, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART OF THIS IS?

21:50.610 --> 21:52.011
TO GET THE MONEY
FROM STEVE,

21:52.078 --> 21:57.149
I HAD TO PROMISE
I'D BE HIS BEST BUDDY
FOR A WEEK.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.719
OUCH.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.589
MAYBE I'LL LUCK OUT
AND HE'LL FORGET
ABOUT IT.

22:03.756 --> 22:07.594
THERE'S MY BEST BUDDY
FOR A WEEK.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.330
I HAVE OUR PLANS
ALL MAPPED OUT.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.265
NOW...

22:13.332 --> 22:16.335
"MONDAY, 5 A.M.--
PLANETARIUM.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.738
"6 A.M.--BUG MUSEUM.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.807
[CRYING]
7 A.M.--
CHEESE FACTORY."
