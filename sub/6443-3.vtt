Freshman year 2001

00:12.021 --> 00:13.876
Are we going to state this year?

00:13.899 --> 00:14.901
Yeah!

00:15.387 --> 00:18.454
I can't hear ya! Who's going
to be the state champions?

00:18.471 --> 00:20.203
The crows!

00:20.239 --> 00:23.174
I need a brave freshman to step up.

00:23.603 --> 00:27.605
Alright, which one of you studs
thinks you're a better quarterback than me?

00:28.813 --> 00:30.231
Kent, how about it?

00:31.446 --> 00:32.244
Huh?

00:33.244 --> 00:34.352
That's okay.

00:34.554 --> 00:39.466
You too busy milking cows to come and try out for the team.
The least you can do is show some school spirit.

00:40.503 --> 00:41.985
Am I right?

00:42.032 --> 00:46.713
Come on, kent,do you wanna take a shot
at the hottest freshman at smallville high?

00:48.428 --> 00:49.862
Come on, Clark!

01:01.524 --> 01:03.808
Come on Clark, you can do it.

01:04.555 --> 01:09.667
Caw! Caw!
Go, crows! Whoo!

01:11.047 --> 01:13.572
Go, clark, you can do it!

01:13.618 --> 01:17.866
- Crows! Whoo-hoo!
- Yay, crows! Who's the lucky freshman this year?

01:17.939 --> 01:20.248
Probably the biggest loser like every year.

01:20.292 --> 01:22.280
Come on, take it off.

01:22.321 --> 01:24.818
- Hey, leave her alone.
- Stop, you guys!

01:24.995 --> 01:29.323
Or what? We always torture
the mascot, kent. It's a tradition.

01:29.367 --> 01:30.945
Leave me alone.

01:31.033 --> 01:32.640
Stop, you...

01:35.412 --> 01:36.945
Scabby abby

01:36.989 --> 01:38.802
Scabby abby!

01:40.424 --> 01:44.021
Scabby abby!

01:54.949 --> 01:57.670
Put your mask back on, scabster!

01:59.100 --> 02:02.668
All right, who's next? Who's
gonna step up and dunk her?

02:17.969 --> 02:19.635
Poor baby.

02:20.107 --> 02:24.352
It's taken three years,
but you finally let mommy help you.

02:26.682 --> 02:28.453
Don't worry, sweetheart.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.950
I won't let you waste your senior year
like you did all the others.

02:33.137 --> 02:35.334
You promise people will like me?

02:35.393 --> 02:37.587
They will. I promise.

02:37.676 --> 02:39.639
Just like they did me.

02:46.290 --> 02:49.026
Everyone will love you when they see the real you...

02:49.070 --> 02:51.645
the one that's been inside all along.

03:01.621 --> 03:05.602
You're going to have a senior year
no one will ever forget.

04:09.137 --> 04:14.445
What a ball game! It's all tied up.
Five seconds left here at metro stadium.

04:14.482 --> 04:19.480
Clark kent, the young phenom from smallville,
has led M.U.'S incredible comeback.

04:19.702 --> 04:23.092
Kent takes the snap from his own
10-yard line. It's hail mary time.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.623
He fades back... here's the pass

04:25.844 --> 04:29.971
a bullet deep downfield
way past his own receiver.

04:30.025 --> 04:35.458
Wait! Kent's now flying down the field.
He's going to catch his own pass! Touchdown!

04:35.523 --> 04:40.034
The meteors win! Kent is unbelievable!

04:44.348 --> 04:46.220
Nice arm, farm boy.

04:47.104 --> 04:48.962
When's the first game?

04:50.451 --> 04:52.666
- I'm not on the team.
- Why not?

04:52.813 --> 04:55.761
An arm like that is a
"get out of geek free" pass.

04:56.145 --> 04:58.778
- Well, even if I wanted to play
- Which obviously you do.

04:58.807 --> 05:00.709
That wouldn't be the reason.

05:01.741 --> 05:04.336
Thanks. I don't really consider myself a geek.

05:05.421 --> 05:06.526
So...

05:06.821 --> 05:09.224
what do you see yourself as?

05:10.215 --> 05:11.258
I don't know.

05:11.297 --> 05:13.457
An outsider, I guess.

05:14.039 --> 05:16.840
That's a recipe for wedgies
if I've ever heard one.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.904
Have I told you how much
I'm going to miss you?

05:23.008 --> 05:24.025
Daddy...

05:26.089 --> 05:28.514
don't you have 3,000 guys to baby sit?

05:28.551 --> 05:30.792
Do you really need
to keep checking up on me?

05:30.836 --> 05:32.989
It would appear that way.

05:33.136 --> 05:36.541
I know that I'm late, but I can still
make it to campus for orientation.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.512
Save yourself a trip. Met. U.
Just yanked your acceptance.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.437
What? They can't do that.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.017
They can if you don't have
enough credits to finish high school.

05:45.076 --> 05:47.862
Look, I know I missed a few classes, but...

05:47.966 --> 05:50.378
lo, you failed the last semester.

05:56.053 --> 06:01.170
Not to worry, though. I'm sure that clark
will be happy to show you around.

06:01.951 --> 06:03.720
- Around where?
- Around where?

06:04.546 --> 06:07.008
Bright and early, tomorrow morning.

06:07.317 --> 06:09.685
You start smallville high.

06:14.756 --> 06:15.664
Great.

06:22.696 --> 06:27.789
You know, socially divisive cliques and hall
passes aside, this place really is not all that bad.

06:29.661 --> 06:33.046
It's the varsity version of dante's seventh ring.

06:33.135 --> 06:36.894
Come on, do you know how many people
would kill to relive their senior year in high school?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.830
Make that semester. Five more credits,
and I amoutta this cowpile.

06:40.874 --> 06:43.244
Wait a minute. Five credit sin one semester?

06:43.288 --> 06:47.003
Lois, the only way you're going to do that is
if you add an extracurricular to your class load.

06:47.047 --> 06:49.951
Like, say, maybe... writing for the "torch. "

06:50.069 --> 06:51.316
Uh,

06:51.729 --> 06:55.621
no hard feelings here, cuz, but, unlike you,
the last thing I want to be is a reporter.

06:55.665 --> 07:00.487
What could be worse than, you know,
uncovering the truth and protecting the public?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.521
And sticking your nose in other people's business.

07:02.566 --> 07:04.600
Like I said, you'd be perfect.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.380
Come on. Let's go.

07:09.931 --> 07:12.378
It's gonna be great having you here.

07:16.860 --> 07:19.513
- Check it out.
- A new girl...

07:31.820 --> 07:33.264
Hi, clark.

07:37.483 --> 07:38.824
Abby?

07:39.016 --> 07:41.375
It's actually Abigail now.

07:44.161 --> 07:46.546
You know, I almost didn't recognize you.

07:47.077 --> 07:50.571
After an entire summer of recovery,

07:50.600 --> 07:51.809
good.

07:52.266 --> 07:57.440
With any luck, this old locker will be the only thing
that stays the same this year.

07:58.899 --> 08:01.022
Yeah, um,that shouldn't be a problem.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.785
So, uh,

08:03.197 --> 08:04.863
why the, uh..

08:05.718 --> 08:07.089
change?

08:09.914 --> 08:12.066
I guess just one day you realize you can

08:12.125 --> 08:15.633
can spend another year being
resentful of what everybody else has

08:15.677 --> 08:18.213
or you can do something about it.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.557
You know, it's our senior year, clark.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.709
This is my last chance.

08:27.328 --> 08:30.129
Good morning, clark. Hey... abby.

08:30.763 --> 08:37.479
Whoa. Either she spent an entire summer at a collagen
farm, or I am shopping at the wrong makeup counter.

08:37.553 --> 08:42.308
How old is she 17? That's like messing with the
batter before the cookies are even baked.

08:42.381 --> 08:45.449
Don't tell me the world
isn't nicer to prettier people.

08:45.493 --> 08:50.779
Besides, you know,I mean, it's her body. And if it
makes her feel better, then it's none of our business.

08:52.843 --> 08:53.964
What?

08:55.063 --> 08:59.950
I'm just stunned that miss "letter to the editor"
doesn't find it one bit distressing that a girl would get

08:59.978 --> 09:02.765
nipped and tucked to fit into some plastic pod person...

09:02.793 --> 09:04.473
I think she looks great.

09:05.271 --> 09:06.741
What a shocker.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.274
Look, that's the problem
with high school. It's all a facade.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.074
Everyone's hiding who they really are
and trying to be something they're not.

09:13.102 --> 09:15.762
Well, it sounds like you've got your first article.

09:15.935 --> 09:17.447
See you in the "torch. "

09:19.043 --> 09:21.946
Okay, I'll write for your paper,
but you better get me extra credit.

09:36.854 --> 09:38.899
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:43.772 --> 09:46.208
A note through the vent of my locker.

09:46.516 --> 09:47.860
Very creative.

09:47.916 --> 09:51.674
Well, I pride myself on being able
to revert back to the fourth grade.

09:51.870 --> 09:55.609
What are you doing here? If we get
caught, I could get detention.

09:55.847 --> 09:57.499
I could get fired.

10:00.748 --> 10:02.054
Coach teague.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.397
I'm Clark Kent.

10:08.439 --> 10:09.437
Hi.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.658
Lana.

10:14.730 --> 10:16.116
What are you doing here?

10:16.144 --> 10:18.893
- Um, I, uh...
- The principal asked this

10:18.935 --> 10:21.987
young lady to give me the grand tour.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.382
It's good to meet you, Clark.

10:25.754 --> 10:28.139
You know, they didn't tell me
you were Jason Teague.

10:29.064 --> 10:33.810
This guy threwa passing record his freshman year
at metropolis university. He could've gone pro.

10:33.866 --> 10:37.063
Yeah, well, now I'm just a transfer
to central kansas a&M.

10:37.105 --> 10:40.745
It's amazing how quickly you fall of
recruiters' lists when you tear your rotator cuff.

10:41.796 --> 10:45.412
Well, then, I, uh, I guess we're
lucky to have you here, coach.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.107
Assistant coach,

10:47.163 --> 10:48.493
miss lang.

10:50.425 --> 10:53.394
Um, quigley's still going to be
calling the plays for you guys.

10:53.632 --> 10:55.639
Well, actually, I'm not on the team.

10:58.229 --> 11:00.119
I was hoping I could try out.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.248
You look big enough. Sure.

11:05.476 --> 11:06.569
The talon.

11:06.597 --> 11:07.591
Lex,

11:07.927 --> 11:10.503
uh, agreed to let me manage it.

11:11.543 --> 11:12.372
Why?

11:12.478 --> 11:16.820
I was lucky to find a job at all, jonathan.
It's not like I have a full rÃ©sumÃ© these days.

11:16.862 --> 11:17.997
Sweetheart,

11:18.095 --> 11:20.755
if we're so worried about money,
then why don't we just go

11:20.783 --> 11:22.841
through the books again?
We'll find some other place to cut.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.200
Like where? We've been over
it every week for two months.

11:26.242 --> 11:31.283
There's no way we can get out from under
these hospital bills. I'm not blaming you. I just...

11:32.813 --> 11:36.458
I just don't want to keep waiting and risk
losing the farm. ou've worked too hard.

11:36.486 --> 11:38.810
Yeah, so that you wouldn't have to.

11:39.944 --> 11:42.605
It's not so bad right now.

11:43.218 --> 11:48.329
You have the farm, and clark is going to go off
to college next year. I need something of my own.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.919
But why does it have to be with the luthors?

11:50.961 --> 11:55.877
I'll be selling espressos, jonathan,
not masterminding hostile takeovers.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.314
Well...

11:59.574 --> 12:01.310
I've always known that

12:01.688 --> 12:04.209
you wanted to have more than just this old farm.

12:05.569 --> 12:08.104
I'm not going to be the one to stand in your way.

12:08.734 --> 12:11.632
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome.

12:12.654 --> 12:13.817
Hey, kent,

12:13.904 --> 12:16.397
I need your permission slip, bud.

12:23.354 --> 12:25.146
What positions have you played?

12:26.645 --> 12:29.935
None, actually. I've never been on a team before.

12:30.257 --> 12:32.398
My father wasn't too keen on the whole idea.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.533
Your dad doesn't know you're here, does he?

12:36.563 --> 12:39.447
When it comes to defying fathers,
I'm kind of a pro.

12:41.870 --> 12:43.348
I'm not doing this for him.

12:45.491 --> 12:47.171
You know, I've seen a lot of guys

12:47.213 --> 12:50.489
join the team just so they can walk
around in a letterman's jacket.

12:50.615 --> 12:53.556
Because they want people to look at them differently.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.097
But football's just a game.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.905
If you want to change, you gotta do that yourself.

13:01.927 --> 13:03.261
That's why I'm here.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.019
All right. Let's see what you got.

13:21.311 --> 13:22.599
All right, kent.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.092
Do something to us.

13:29.251 --> 13:33.036
All right, guys, let's go!

13:40.490 --> 13:42.493
Alright guys, On two...

13:45.339 --> 13:47.174
hut! Hut!

13:55.732 --> 13:57.328
All right, that'll work.

13:57.356 --> 13:59.499
Line up again, guys.
Oh, man!

13:59.905 --> 14:01.935
Checkout Scabby abby.

14:03.097 --> 14:04.778
It's fake, you know.

14:04.806 --> 14:06.206
Who cares...

14:08.822 --> 14:10.054
Are you kidding me?

14:10.740 --> 14:12.560
Men, is she hot...

14:13.680 --> 14:15.473
Whoo!Yeah!

14:33.115 --> 14:34.907
I didn't mean to scare you.

14:35.859 --> 14:37.974
Just... I can't stop thinking about you.

14:39.028 --> 14:42.333
You mean the girl you nicknamed "scabby abby"?

14:42.767 --> 14:45.105
Yeah, I totally deserved that.

14:45.945 --> 14:49.996
Maybe if I'd been more patient,
I would've seen who you really are.

14:50.710 --> 14:52.012
The most...

14:52.446 --> 14:54.561
beautiful girl in school.

15:07.827 --> 15:10.096
I have a lot to apologize for.

15:11.104 --> 15:12.588
What do you say

15:13.624 --> 15:16.019
we go some place a little more quiet?

15:28.209 --> 15:30.261
Where are we going?

16:27.749 --> 16:28.911
What are you doing?

16:28.967 --> 16:30.521
You didn't feel that?

16:31.436 --> 16:32.808
Of course I did.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.259
No. I..

16:35.441 --> 16:36.785
I should go.

16:38.325 --> 16:39.684
What's going on?

16:39.768 --> 16:41.364
Abigail, wait.

16:41.795 --> 16:46.752
Oh, I get it. New face... same old, boring scabby.

16:49.650 --> 16:50.603
Hey!

16:57.552 --> 16:58.784
Oh, my god.

16:58.802 --> 16:59.769
Bret?

17:00.903 --> 17:02.513
What's happening?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.431
What's wrong?

17:04.473 --> 17:05.832
Oh, my god.

17:07.106 --> 17:08.566
My face.

17:08.846 --> 17:10.135
My God...

17:10.401 --> 17:12.011
what did you do to me?

17:14.839 --> 17:16.958
No! My face!

17:17.223 --> 17:21.451
Admissions office? Look, I'm in the
nation'scream corn capital, retaking calculus.

17:21.498 --> 17:25.083
No, don't put me on hold.
Could this day be any worse?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.943
- No, that's everything.
- Thank you.

17:42.550 --> 17:43.814
Lois,

17:44.178 --> 17:45.411
what's going on?

17:45.453 --> 17:47.609
He just ran right out in front of me.

17:48.575 --> 17:51.786
I don't know. They said he's going
to be okay. Psychically, anyway.

17:52.094 --> 17:54.082
The cops think he kind a lost it.

17:54.264 --> 17:55.384
Who... bret?

17:56.687 --> 17:59.346
I just saw him at practice
an hour ago. He was fine.

17:59.388 --> 18:00.606
Are you sure about that?

18:00.648 --> 18:01.349
Yeah.

18:01.391 --> 18:05.185
Think about it, clark.
It's the start of a new season,

18:05.339 --> 18:09.178
scholar ships... the entire town
counting on you to be their hero?

18:09.220 --> 18:12.525
Who knows what kind of neuroses are
hiding behind that big man on campus mask?

18:12.581 --> 18:15.031
No way. If anything, bret was too overconfident.

18:15.185 --> 18:16.865
He probably just didn'tsee you.

18:17.285 --> 18:20.339
Yeah, that might explain
the broken windshield, but...

18:20.451 --> 18:23.994
do you want to tell me why he was
running around half naked, soaking wet?

18:24.050 --> 18:25.394
Why would he do that?

18:31.595 --> 18:35.782
Hey, hey, last time I checked, you were
missing a few prerequisites for being in here.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.008
So you have been checking me out.

18:38.316 --> 18:40.463
Lois, just wait outside.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.423
Are you kidding?

18:42.465 --> 18:46.148
Tortured senior can't keep up
the hometown hero act in buckles?

18:46.386 --> 18:50.208
This is as juicy as my teen cosmetic surgery article.

18:50.810 --> 18:52.309
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

18:52.351 --> 18:54.353
How well did you know bret anderson?

18:54.899 --> 18:56.887
Not as well as I'd like to know you.

18:57.256 --> 18:58.418
Charming.

18:58.558 --> 19:02.577
Look, bret ranin front of my car. Do any
of you guys know what that was all about?

19:43.001 --> 19:45.731
Are you used to throughout other people's mail?

19:47.327 --> 19:50.632
Sorry. The box was addressed to the talon.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.771
Something tells me this isn't a
book-of-the-month selection.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.123
What's with

19:57.263 --> 20:00.078
this fascination with ancient writings?

20:01.062 --> 20:02.799
School project.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.559
That must be the same project
clark's always working on.

20:08.077 --> 20:11.890
For two people so different,
you have remarkably similar interests.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.225
It still amazes mew hat you did with this place.

20:17.301 --> 20:21.068
You saw promise in something everyone
else thought was beyond redemption.

20:21.695 --> 20:22.577
Huh.

20:23.039 --> 20:26.400
This is a side of lex luthor I've never seen before.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.851
You're coming dangerously close to being nostalgic.

20:45.388 --> 20:47.727
Congratulations are in order.

20:49.141 --> 20:52.146
Coach quigley called. You made the football team.

20:52.916 --> 20:55.464
You don't have to worry, dad.
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

20:55.758 --> 20:57.326
I know how to control my abilities.

20:57.358 --> 21:00.316
The person I'm worried about
you hurting, clark... is yourself.

21:02.929 --> 21:07.774
You're gonna be tempted to run just
a little bit faster, to throw the ball...

21:08.432 --> 21:10.911
just far enough to win every game.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.282
You think I'm gonna cheat?

21:14.786 --> 21:19.211
I won't cross that line. You won't
even know where that line is, clark.

21:20.541 --> 21:25.964
Come on, think about it. You're out there, your friends are
giving it their all. You're gonna do what ever it takes to win.

21:26.006 --> 21:28.008
That's football, son.

21:28.695 --> 21:32.286
And with you, it's never gonna be a fair competition.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.863
Well, let's talk about what's fair.

21:35.633 --> 21:38.097
What's the first thing you remember
about high school when you think back?

21:38.139 --> 21:40.762
- No, no, no...
- don't tell me it's not football.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.710
I want that, too, dad.

21:44.976 --> 21:48.369
And I'm sick of begging for
the same chances that you just had.

21:50.707 --> 21:52.149
I want my own life.

22:08.899 --> 22:12.456
You're not the first person to walk
through that door with tattoo remorse.

22:13.282 --> 22:15.830
But you're the first one to do it without ink.

22:16.223 --> 22:17.469
What?

22:17.623 --> 22:19.798
Whatever this pigment is,

22:19.840 --> 22:23.242
it's almost as though the symbol
were branded underneath your skin.

22:24.502 --> 22:27.377
Someone wanted to leave a mark
you wouldn't easily forget.

22:28.133 --> 22:30.583
But you can still remove it, right?

22:30.877 --> 22:37.691
Well, I'll have to send this tissue sample off to the lab, but I am
guessing removal won't be possible without a complete skin graft.

22:38.475 --> 22:40.029
But we'll see.

22:43.418 --> 22:45.686
You go to school with my daughter, don't you?

22:47.325 --> 22:49.314
I never forget a face...

22:51.113 --> 22:54.135
especially a perfect one like yours.

22:56.977 --> 22:59.203
It must get you anything you want, hmm?

23:03.149 --> 23:04.297
Abby...

23:05.334 --> 23:08.148
how's bret? I saw you two in the hall.

23:08.176 --> 23:10.108
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:12.475 --> 23:13.969
I'll talk to you later.

23:14.837 --> 23:15.902
Thank you.

23:15.972 --> 23:18.660
Um, bye. Dr. Fine.

23:19.864 --> 23:21.797
What did you do to me?

23:22.613 --> 23:26.758
I kissed this guy,and he freaked out. It was like...
it was like he went insane or something.

23:26.786 --> 23:29.936
You were my first trial at this, abigail.

23:29.978 --> 23:31.564
I mean, there's always potential for complication.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.953
- Complication? Bret's atthe hospital because of me.
- Bret?

23:35.065 --> 23:37.964
Isn't this the boy that named you "scabby abby"?

23:38.202 --> 23:40.414
Maybe he got exactly what he deserved.

23:40.484 --> 23:42.071
And lana should, too.

23:42.253 --> 23:43.276
Lana?

23:43.332 --> 23:45.866
But lana never did anything to me.

23:48.975 --> 23:53.096
Lana saw the two of you together.
She's already asking questions.

23:53.138 --> 23:54.468
You think she knows?

23:54.524 --> 23:57.395
This is a very serious problem, abigail.

23:58.893 --> 24:00.633
If lana says anything

24:00.689 --> 24:03.826
to anyone about what's happened
between you and this boy,

24:04.050 --> 24:05.898
they'll take all of this away from me.

24:06.388 --> 24:08.363
And without your treatments,

24:08.797 --> 24:11.661
you're going to revert back exactly
the way you used to be.

24:12.291 --> 24:14.329
Is that really what you want?

24:14.830 --> 24:15.956
No.

24:16.184 --> 24:18.663
I have done everything for you.

24:21.762 --> 24:25.207
And now I need you to do something for me.

24:29.539 --> 24:30.807
Yeah.

24:30.998 --> 24:32.035
Okay.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.280
It's the old drama room.

24:38.336 --> 24:40.020
Wow..

24:41.379 --> 24:45.467
Oh, this is an interesting detour
from the coach's office.

24:45.495 --> 24:47.330
I didn't even know this room existed.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.835
Yep. Neither does anyone else, hopefully.

24:51.059 --> 24:55.582
I still can't believe that you have a job at my school.

24:55.638 --> 24:56.734
I know.

24:57.140 --> 25:00.249
I guess I'm gonna have to get used
to my guys drooling over you.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.517
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

25:02.699 --> 25:03.795
Yeah?

25:04.467 --> 25:06.484
What about clark kent?

25:10.082 --> 25:15.634
I thought that you said you had a surprise
for me. How did this become about clark?

25:16.236 --> 25:18.098
It was strange. He...

25:18.420 --> 25:20.338
He kind a opened up to me today.

25:21.445 --> 25:24.460
You have no idea how strange that really is.

25:24.530 --> 25:25.818
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:25.944 --> 25:30.159
The thing is, you know, running the
drills and putting together a...

25:30.583 --> 25:33.314
a good team is one thing, but...

25:33.888 --> 25:36.576
having guys like clark coming in for advice

25:36.968 --> 25:41.565
it's not gonna be so easy when these guys are looking
at me like I'm an adult. I still feel like I'm part of the team.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.249
But this moment isn't about me.

25:48.613 --> 25:49.817
No.

25:51.035 --> 25:51.987
Hold on.

25:52.001 --> 25:53.051
Okay.

25:53.121 --> 25:55.478
It's about this.

25:55.772 --> 25:57.369
- Oh, dear. That would be a blindfold.
- Yes, it would.

25:57.397 --> 25:58.671
Okay.

25:58.783 --> 26:00.855
So, what do you think you're gonna get out of this?

26:00.911 --> 26:02.787
Nothing. It's just that

26:02.983 --> 26:06.092
we never really got to celebrate
somebody's birthday.

26:06.134 --> 26:07.366
Right...

26:07.646 --> 26:09.873
so you stay right here.

26:09.915 --> 26:11.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:12.953 --> 26:14.116
Don't peek.

26:27.049 --> 26:28.533
Jason?

26:31.964 --> 26:33.396
Hello?

26:39.417 --> 26:42.008
Jason, what are you do...

26:55.494 --> 26:56.866
abby?

26:57.469 --> 26:59.429
I'm sorry, lana.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.699
I don't know if you can even hear me, lana...

28:01.191 --> 28:03.460
but if you knew how much you meant to me...

28:05.742 --> 28:07.814
well, I guess the polite thing to do is

28:08.052 --> 28:10.941
cough and let you know I'm standing here, but...

28:11.333 --> 28:14.273
that always seems so forced, doesn't it?

28:17.886 --> 28:19.271
How is she?

28:19.761 --> 28:22.226
Well, they don't know what's wrong with her, so it's

28:22.296 --> 28:23.906
it's kind a hard to say.

28:25.908 --> 28:27.267
Lex luthor.

28:28.121 --> 28:29.597
Jason teague.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.586
I, uh, work at the school.
I'm the new assistant football coach.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.846
Teague.

28:35.896 --> 28:38.965
As in marion, teague & weisman?

28:41.906 --> 28:43.614
That's my father's firm.

28:45.098 --> 28:49.187
And you decided to get as far away
from the family business as possible.

28:49.408 --> 28:50.696
Smart move.

28:52.097 --> 28:55.681
It didn't exactly go down like that.
He, uh, he cut me off.

28:56.703 --> 29:01.362
Well, what better place to kick-start
a new career than smallville high.

29:01.402 --> 29:02.497
Yeah.

29:02.973 --> 29:07.453
Certainly responsible of the school to send
over a representative to check in on her.

29:08.293 --> 29:09.904
Oh, um,

29:10.280 --> 29:13.403
yeah, I just I thought I'd stop byon the way home.

29:13.431 --> 29:14.663
It was nothing.

29:16.679 --> 29:18.275
I doubt that.

29:30.699 --> 29:32.603
Lana deserves the best.

29:35.657 --> 29:37.225
I hope you're it.

30:09.533 --> 30:10.555
Hey.

30:10.765 --> 30:11.969
How's she doing?

30:12.225 --> 30:13.597
She's pretty cut up.

30:14.340 --> 30:18.554
They gave her a sedative, but she keeps saying,
"don't let him see me" over and over again.

30:18.596 --> 30:20.123
It's like some kind of breakdown.

30:20.168 --> 30:22.647
When they brought bret in,
he was acting the same way,

30:22.773 --> 30:26.063
but the only thing they can find in common
is a spike in their serotonin levels.

30:26.105 --> 30:27.537
Serotonin?

30:27.691 --> 30:31.178
- It's a brain chemical.
- That Isdand hallucinogens mimic.

30:32.032 --> 30:38.353
It's also the word that lois misspelled three times
in her slander piece on extreme makeovers...

30:39.079 --> 30:41.674
yeah, well, lana and bret are hardly
candidates for plastic surgery.

30:41.702 --> 30:43.662
Yeah, but abby was.

30:43.704 --> 30:48.353
Didn't lana say she saw bret with abby
right before he went crazy?

30:48.969 --> 30:52.251
Maybe this procedure made
her more beast than beauty.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.672
My parents don't understand.

30:59.714 --> 31:02.346
They say I'm too young for plastic surgery.

31:02.767 --> 31:05.959
Well, some parents don't
remember what it was like.

31:06.309 --> 31:09.404
When I was your age, I wasn't
exactly home coming queen.

31:09.908 --> 31:14.829
I worked harder than all the pretty girls,
only to watch every thing get handed to them.

31:15.795 --> 31:19.281
Seven surgeries in two years changed all that.

31:24.867 --> 31:30.173
You know,I was actually interested
in that new procedure you used on abby.

31:30.272 --> 31:33.077
Is it really true that you only have to come in once?

31:33.133 --> 31:35.093
That's why I developed the process.

31:35.247 --> 31:38.874
I didn't want to watch my daughter go
through the pain that I endured only to have

31:38.930 --> 31:41.945
what other girls were lucky enough to be born with.

31:42.631 --> 31:45.417
So let's get you scheduled here.

31:45.473 --> 31:46.621
Yes please.

31:49.704 --> 31:51.861
You know, I'm actually running a little late.

31:51.889 --> 31:53.653
Are you recording this?

31:57.125 --> 31:58.792
I'm going to expose you.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.581
Who are you to stop people from being their best?

32:02.309 --> 32:03.668
Call me crazy,

32:03.710 --> 32:06.468
but I've always been
a firm believer that beauty...

32:06.678 --> 32:08.372
it's on the inside.

32:13.247 --> 32:17.671
The people that say that are the ones
who already have it on the outside.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.364
- Okay.
- Wow.

32:23.420 --> 32:26.599
- You kind a let the inner slob out, huh?
- Yeah, and her name is lois.

32:26.627 --> 32:31.276
She's been pulling these articles that abby's
mom published on this new breakthrough...

32:31.332 --> 32:35.562
instant makeover technique.
But, uh, dr. Finer an into one snag.

32:35.604 --> 32:39.272
It's sending the patients'serotonin levels into overdrive.

32:39.748 --> 32:45.701
It says here dr. Fine was working on a suppression medication
called cerethro to keep the serotonin level sin check.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.073
Maybe it worked.

32:47.115 --> 32:49.733
Maybe abby was the trial run.

32:50.727 --> 32:55.043
Only abby'sseismic surgery
didn't come without aftershocks.

32:55.155 --> 33:00.168
She's passing something to people
that's super-boosting their serotonin.

33:00.224 --> 33:03.851
That makes sense if she kisses bret,
but what about lana?

33:04.415 --> 33:07.062
I don't know. All I do know is
that abby's not hallucinating,

33:07.118 --> 33:11.948
so maybe all lana and bret need
is a dose of that cerethro medication.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.954
Looks like lois is one step ahead of us.

33:27.067 --> 33:28.846
What are you doing?

33:28.888 --> 33:31.478
Giving you the inside scoop.

33:33.438 --> 33:36.983
You really want to know what it was like
for Abigail all of those years?

33:38.579 --> 33:40.862
Well, you're gonna find out.

33:51.739 --> 33:55.687
And without the suppressant
to balance out your serotonin levels,

33:55.729 --> 33:58.418
you'll be filing your story from the psych ward.

34:34.831 --> 34:35.994
Clark!

34:55.126 --> 34:56.330
Clark!

34:57.773 --> 34:59.713
- Are you okay?
- Get me out of here.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.761
Okay.

35:06.774 --> 35:07.936
Bitch.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.251
I don't know how to

35:19.293 --> 35:23.059
tell you this without sounding really stuck-up...

35:23.591 --> 35:26.480
I already know you're stuck-up.
In fact, I wanted to talk to you about that.

35:26.522 --> 35:27.698
You're funny.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.966
Yeah. And cute, huh?

35:32.585 --> 35:34.768
Okay, jason, look, I'm being serious.

35:34.992 --> 35:35.986
All right.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.865
Back in freshman year, I, uh,

35:39.893 --> 35:42.218
made the cheerleading squad.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.864
And that was my whole identity.

35:46.239 --> 35:47.766
Putting on the face

35:47.850 --> 35:50.202
that I thought everyone wanted to see.

35:59.165 --> 36:03.001
I keep thinking of all the times
that you've told me that I'm beautiful.

36:03.057 --> 36:05.064
And, um...

36:05.610 --> 36:07.500
I can't help but wonder

36:07.920 --> 36:10.454
how much of me you really see.

36:16.538 --> 36:19.030
Lana, I tell you you're beautiful because of

36:19.072 --> 36:22.083
who you are, not because of what I see.

36:25.041 --> 36:28.920
I mean, you're the girl I flew half
way across the world to be with.

36:31.258 --> 36:32.462
The girl who

36:33.149 --> 36:37.368
kicks the crap out of me at xbox
and thinks it's hysterical.

36:38.488 --> 36:43.827
I mean, I have seen you with the stomach flu where your eyes
were puffy and your nose was running, you're yakking...

36:43.869 --> 36:46.376
okay, okay, I get the picture.

36:50.898 --> 36:52.551
All I'm saying is,

36:53.657 --> 36:55.393
the reasons I love you

36:58.502 --> 37:00.931
it's not something you can see in a mirror.

37:05.286 --> 37:08.553
That's good. I'm gonna write
that down and use that later.

37:25.075 --> 37:27.362
I guess practice ran late, huh?

37:34.265 --> 37:36.487
Dad, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

37:37.509 --> 37:39.204
But I'm staying on the team.

37:42.704 --> 37:44.875
I'm tired of living my life on the sidelines.

37:45.239 --> 37:47.239
I realize that, clark.

37:48.261 --> 37:51.412
I also realize that you're a senior in high school, and...

37:51.762 --> 37:54.450
from now on, you're gonna be
making a lot of your own decisions.

37:58.405 --> 38:00.268
But if you want to be

38:00.380 --> 38:04.146
seen as an adult in this family, then you're
gonna have to start acting like one.

38:08.931 --> 38:11.942
Adults in this family don't run off and

38:12.026 --> 38:14.616
do things without discussing them first.

38:19.383 --> 38:20.517
I know.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.306
That's why I have just one question for you.

38:28.163 --> 38:32.072
Are you gonna let some assistant coach from
metropolis teach your boy how to play football?

38:41.599 --> 38:42.916
Go deep.

38:54.924 --> 38:56.282
Yeah!

39:03.945 --> 39:06.774
SKIN DEEP

39:10.400 --> 39:13.107
Admiring the genius within, huh?

39:13.163 --> 39:14.451
It had a typo.

39:14.479 --> 39:16.509
Oh, nice try.

39:16.523 --> 39:17.405
So,

39:17.447 --> 39:19.926
I followed upon the abby story line, and

39:19.958 --> 39:24.636
it looks like mother makeover is gonna be playing
"mirror, mirror" on the psych ward wall from now on.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.444
- Is abby gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be back next week.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.605
So, are you excited for your first pep rally?

39:29.633 --> 39:31.943
Not exactly the friday night
I've been dreaming of.

39:31.971 --> 39:35.289
Oh, come on, it's your debut
as smallville's newest celeb.

39:35.331 --> 39:39.522
Yeah, right. One plastics 'r' us piece, and they're
gonna be holding tables all over town for me.

39:39.564 --> 39:44.535
You'd be surprised. I mean,not that I'm ceding my
stance on a woman's right to choose rhinoplasty, but...

39:44.647 --> 39:46.550
you've got fan mail.

39:46.606 --> 39:49.351
Looks like your little exposÃ© struck a couple chords.

39:49.407 --> 39:52.515
I didn't even expect anybody
to read this, let alone have A..

39:52.655 --> 39:55.054
"life-changing experience"?

39:55.082 --> 39:55.922
Please.

39:55.964 --> 40:00.011
Whatever. Say what you want,
but I know inside it's getting to you.

40:00.039 --> 40:02.559
Welcome to the bull pen, miss lane.

40:02.773 --> 40:07.198
I'm off to see clark kent
in a wet t-shirt. Care to join me?

40:08.010 --> 40:10.194
It's something I've never seen before.

40:20.304 --> 40:22.601
Keep your eye on the target.

40:23.119 --> 40:25.989
Come on, lois, didn't those guys
on the base teach you anything?

40:26.311 --> 40:27.851
Wouldn't you like to know?

40:28.458 --> 40:30.517
It doesn't matter, 'cause you are going down.

40:30.545 --> 40:31.777
That'll be the day

40:31.875 --> 40:34.843
Kent!Kent! Kent! Kent!

40:41.219 --> 40:43.394
Whoooo! Yeah!

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
