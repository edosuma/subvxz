00:46.750 --> 00:48.708
I think of nothing.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.458
My head is completely empty.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.542
I love the ball.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.583
I'm in love with the ball.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.583
It is round,
like my girlfriend's ass.

01:05.125 --> 01:08.625
There's nothing but
the ball and the goal.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.750
I take the ball,

01:12.667 --> 01:14.458
I run to the goal

01:15.708 --> 01:17.625
and I kick the ball into it.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.208
I feel the sun.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.458
I feel the green grass.

01:24.625 --> 01:29.625
I feel the Jersey on my body
and the shoes on my feet.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.167
I feel the air and the wind.

01:34.583 --> 01:38.292
I concentrate with all my
senses.

01:40.708 --> 01:43.250
Football is my life.

01:44.917 --> 01:46.458
I breathe football.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.250
Playing football is what I want.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.917
I know who I am.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.625
I think of nothing but football

01:58.333 --> 02:01.625
because nothing else
exists for me.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.708
Who am I talking to?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Who am I talking to?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.375
Who? Hello!

02:06.667 --> 02:08.208
Hey! Who am I talking to?

02:08.792 --> 02:10.458
Look me in the eye then,
look at me.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.250
Get the ball, show me.

02:13.542 --> 02:14.583
Come on.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.333
Wake up, come here,
look here, come on now,

02:18.625 --> 02:19.667
show me what you got.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.542
Come on, come on, come on,

02:21.958 --> 02:22.958
do it.

02:23.042 --> 02:26.167
Shit, what are you doing?
You play like my little daughter.

02:26.750 --> 02:27.875
Losen

02:28.667 --> 02:31.583
you can do better, come on!

02:54.458 --> 02:55.875
One more time!

03:06.875 --> 03:09.583
You're worth more than
all the others put together.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.542
But you're going to
have to work harder,

03:11.833 --> 03:13.167
much harder.

03:13.458 --> 03:17.292
All I'm saying is,
you'll thank me for this later.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.542
I bet I'm going to score
three goals tomorrow.

04:41.833 --> 04:42.833
How'd you do that?

04:43.042 --> 04:44.042
Easily.

04:48.542 --> 04:51.750
If you manage to score us three,
the entire team will kiss you.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.625
Fuck off, man!

06:14.542 --> 06:17.958
Come on, are you shitting
yourselves? Get out there!

06:18.250 --> 06:19.750
Come on, move it!

06:35.417 --> 06:39.750
Can you only put gel in
your hair, or can you play too?

06:48.958 --> 06:49.958
To me!

06:50.417 --> 06:54.417
Use your bodies,
put your shoulder into it!

06:55.667 --> 06:58.792
Are you blind? That was nothing,
he must have slipped!

07:39.750 --> 07:41.500
Szabi, do you speak German?

07:44.792 --> 07:47.375
How were you leading?
How were you leading the team?

07:47.708 --> 07:50.375
Out on the field,
you made a huge mess of it.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.458
You told me to knock him over.

07:52.750 --> 07:53.833
Shut your trap!

08:00.250 --> 08:02.625
You are a zero,
a nothing, a nobody.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.958
I can find someone
like you on every corner.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.708
The scout from dortmund left,
do you know why?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.750
Not because of
the fucking red card.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.792
But because you're
a mediocre player.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.292
What are you looking at?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.333
Do I look that good?

08:57.833 --> 09:00.583
You should have passed to me,
I was right there.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.417
You can't shoot anyway.

09:08.792 --> 09:09.917
What did you say?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.167
Are you deaf?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.375
Take your hands off me.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.042
You want this, right?

09:20.250 --> 09:21.750
You want this?!

10:14.458 --> 10:21.167
Airberlin flight 9032 to
Budapest is ready for boarding.

10:21.708 --> 10:26.625
Passengers are requested
to proceed to gate a17.

10:27.958 --> 10:31.667
Airberlin flight 9032

16:34.125 --> 16:35.208
Does it hurt?

16:53.833 --> 16:55.750
Are you gonna call the cops now?

16:57.708 --> 16:59.208
You think I should?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.625
You wanna live here?

17:24.833 --> 17:25.833
Yeah.

17:32.167 --> 17:35.750
I inherited the place, but
someone broke in and messed it up.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.667
You're going to have a leak.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.167
I already have.

17:57.083 --> 18:01.167
It shouldn't be much work,
the tiles need to be redone.

19:39.958 --> 19:41.500
You took your time.

19:43.625 --> 19:44.625
Your girlfriend?

19:45.458 --> 19:46.708
Yeah, kinda.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.083
Wait, it

20:03.792 --> 20:07.333
that was a good one. You should
only toss the broken ones.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.292
Put the good ones aside. That
one.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.167
No, that's just rubble.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.500
Yeah, that too.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.625
Pull it off.

20:34.292 --> 20:35.542
That one too.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.083
That can go.

20:51.833 --> 20:55.417
Put that aside,
that one, that's good.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.542
All right, that's it for today.

21:26.292 --> 21:27.292
Why?

21:27.708 --> 21:30.833
Cause we'll continue tomorrow.
Storm's coming.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.042
I thought you came here to work.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.875
Wasn't I working?

21:37.375 --> 21:39.292
Are you gonna pay me for today?

22:44.708 --> 22:47.292
They got wet.
You didn't cover them properly.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.833
Now we'll have to
wait for them to dry out.

22:50.583 --> 22:53.250
You told me to cover
them, and I did.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.333
You should have
taken them inside.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.875
I'll come back tomorrow,
once they're dry.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.583
You don't give a fuck
about this, do you?

23:07.708 --> 23:09.833
You've never done this before.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.458
Show me how to do it then.

24:26.542 --> 24:27.750
Are you all right?

24:28.250 --> 24:29.500
Can you hear me?

24:31.708 --> 24:33.875
This crap collapsed on me.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.000
Sit up.

24:41.292 --> 24:42.375
Better?

24:43.667 --> 24:44.667
Yeah.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.667
You want some water?

24:51.125 --> 24:53.792
Get me some booze,
for fuck's sake. Beer.

24:57.458 --> 24:58.875
Come on in!

24:59.708 --> 25:01.583
No way. It's cold.

25:02.250 --> 25:06.208
It's not fucking cold.
It's fine.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.667
Leave me alone.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.708
Throw me the booze.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.375
What the fuck are you doing?

25:37.667 --> 25:38.958
I can't swim.

25:39.250 --> 25:42.250
Wait, I'll hold you up.
Just lie still.

25:48.458 --> 25:52.083
Relax. Just lie on the water.

27:33.375 --> 27:34.792
Are you ok?

33:38.708 --> 33:40.500
Why are you afraid of me?

33:43.792 --> 33:45.750
You could have come home.

33:48.333 --> 33:50.792
You know you can
tell me anything.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.708
It would have been all right.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.042
Here you go, eat.

34:16.875 --> 34:20.583
I'll clean your room tomorrow.
You can sleep in mine till then, ok?

34:59.375 --> 35:00.375
Hey,

35:01.667 --> 35:02.708
pay attention.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.500
Once again, watch your rhythm.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.375
Come on.

35:15.542 --> 35:18.792
Good, good.

35:24.542 --> 35:27.792
Careful, come on, do it, do it.

35:42.417 --> 35:44.333
I'll buy you a ticket tonight.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.000
You'll be back
the day after tomorrow.

35:47.583 --> 35:49.250
I'm not going back.

35:51.708 --> 35:52.833
Because?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.625
I'm quitting football.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.292
What do you mean
you're quitting?

36:05.958 --> 36:07.542
You know when I quit?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.083
Yes, dad, I know.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.875
Oh, son.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.792
Do you know how many times
I wanted to quit?

36:17.417 --> 36:20.667
But you can't.
This is your life.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.083
Not mine.

36:25.667 --> 36:26.833
What, then?

36:30.375 --> 36:31.625
I don't know, dad.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.208
I'll keep bees.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.167
You'll keep bees.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.458
On grandad's farm.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.333
On grandad's farm?

36:43.833 --> 36:45.250
There.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.083
Do you know what
you're talking about?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.292
Hmm?

36:54.667 --> 36:55.708
Look at me.

36:57.833 --> 36:59.417
Can you hear me?

37:00.333 --> 37:02.417
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

37:03.417 --> 37:07.208
Can't you hear me? Look!
What? You wanna hit me, son?

37:07.792 --> 37:09.375
Idiot.

37:23.792 --> 37:28.292
I'll call your manager tomorrow.
I'll fix this fuckup for you.

37:44.167 --> 37:46.042
God forbid you thank me.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.792
You bet I won't.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.292
Dad!

38:09.458 --> 38:11.333
Dad, are you there?

39:16.500 --> 39:18.125
The lord be with you.

39:18.417 --> 39:20.083
And with your spirit.

39:20.375 --> 39:21.792
Lift up your hearts.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.292
We lift them up to the lord.

39:24.833 --> 39:27.708
Let us give thanks
to the lord our god.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.458
It is right and just.

39:31.833 --> 39:36.333
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,

39:36.667 --> 39:39.792
at all times to
acclaim you, o lord,

39:40.083 --> 39:43.333
but in this time above all
to laud you yet more gloriously,

39:43.667 --> 39:47.792
when Christ our passover
has been sacrificed.

39:48.083 --> 39:51.208
For he is the true lamb who has
taken away the sins of the world;

39:51.500 --> 39:54.458
by dying he has destroyed our
death, and by rising, restored our life.

39:54.750 --> 39:59.833
Therefore, overcome
with paschal joy,

40:01.000 --> 40:05.083
every land, every people exults
in your praise

40:05.375 --> 40:08.208
and even the heavenly powers,
with the angelic hosts,

40:09.000 --> 40:14.625
sing together the unending
hymn of your glory,

40:50.792 --> 40:52.208
Are you Hungarian?

40:54.750 --> 40:56.042
Hey, do you speak Hungarian?

40:56.542 --> 40:57.583
Yes, I do.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.875
Is Aron working for you?

41:02.625 --> 41:04.083
Are you paying him decently?

41:04.458 --> 41:05.917
Yes, why, what did he tell you?

41:06.458 --> 41:07.917
Drink up, then.

41:14.667 --> 41:16.500
Give it to Aron.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.875
In the forest I was walking,

42:26.458 --> 42:27.833
there a posy I saw blooming.

42:28.167 --> 42:30.042
Before it withers away,

42:30.333 --> 42:31.792
may I water it, I pray?

42:32.083 --> 42:33.375
You may.

42:40.833 --> 42:42.250
Thanks.

42:46.958 --> 42:49.625
No, no, noooooo!

42:51.125 --> 42:52.792
Happy easter!

42:57.792 --> 42:58.792
Stop!

42:59.125 --> 43:01.250
This woke you up,
didn't it, sister?

43:01.542 --> 43:02.583
Give me a kiss.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.375
Happy easter!

43:08.917 --> 43:10.375
Let's have some schnapps.

44:40.292 --> 44:41.292
Szabi!

49:37.958 --> 49:39.167
Mom.

49:41.333 --> 49:42.333
Hmm?

49:44.125 --> 49:45.208
Go on.

49:52.958 --> 49:55.250
I had a fight with szabi.

49:58.667 --> 50:00.042
How come?

50:06.833 --> 50:08.708
He felt me up.

50:21.417 --> 50:23.375
What do you mean he felt you up?

50:26.792 --> 50:29.625
I mean he felt me up.

50:32.708 --> 50:34.625
And I let him.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.208
I don't know why.

50:42.458 --> 50:44.208
I just let him.

50:47.458 --> 50:49.750
I couldn't do anything.

50:54.708 --> 50:56.792
Why didn't you leave?

51:00.125 --> 51:01.625
I don't know.

51:04.125 --> 51:06.042
I don't know why I didn't.

51:13.250 --> 51:14.370
Come oh, come oh, come oi'i!

51:22.583 --> 51:24.292
This way! Good!

51:26.375 --> 51:27.417
Quick, quick, pass!

51:27.708 --> 51:28.708
- Yes!
- Come on!

51:28.958 --> 51:29.958
Watch out!

51:30.167 --> 51:31.167
Shoot it!

51:32.958 --> 51:34.167
What the fuck are you doing?

51:34.458 --> 51:35.458
Stay down.

51:45.708 --> 51:48.125
Are you insane? Why the
fuck are you defending him?

51:48.417 --> 51:49.792
You want some too?

51:56.875 --> 51:58.167
Stay down.

52:13.583 --> 52:15.542
What are you waiting for,
come on!

53:05.125 --> 53:06.500
Hello, Bernard.

53:12.250 --> 53:15.292
I just wanted to talk to you.

53:24.833 --> 53:28.250
I'm in a house
in the middle of nowhere.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.333
I'm all alone.

53:36.125 --> 53:39.458
There's nothing here,
just darkness,

53:40.875 --> 53:42.417
and silence,

53:43.583 --> 53:45.167
fucking silence.

53:47.667 --> 53:51.750
And the dog howls
so I wake up every night.

54:01.708 --> 54:07.083
Maybe it was all stupid,
and I shouldn't have come here.

54:23.583 --> 54:25.083
Take care.

55:14.333 --> 55:15.625
Morning, ma'am.

55:16.708 --> 55:18.375
Aron isn't at home.

55:25.792 --> 55:27.167
Where is he?

55:28.500 --> 55:30.667
I don't know, he hasn't told me.

55:37.458 --> 55:39.542
Don't come here again.

55:40.708 --> 55:42.625
Leave him alone.

55:45.583 --> 55:47.875
We're not like you here.

55:49.667 --> 55:51.458
Aron's not like you.

56:33.250 --> 56:34.250
Hi.

56:37.292 --> 56:38.333
Hi.

56:42.875 --> 56:44.625
What did you come here for?

56:45.417 --> 56:47.458
I'm starting the work
with the bees.

56:52.083 --> 56:53.417
Good for you.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.708
I want to do it with you.

57:03.708 --> 57:07.250
Do it alone. I don't know how
to, and I don't have time anyway.

58:48.750 --> 58:51.083
Hey, aren't you gonna work?

1:01:29.417 --> 1:01:30.417
What is it?

1:01:33.458 --> 1:01:34.625
You are here?

1:01:37.875 --> 1:01:39.458
But where?

1:02:37.375 --> 1:02:42.625
It's a bit cold, but don't panic. I
can warm it up for you if you'd like.

1:02:42.917 --> 1:02:44.000
It doesn't matter.

1:03:02.542 --> 1:03:05.708
It's really beautiful here,
but a bathroom wouldn't be bad.

1:03:15.083 --> 1:03:17.125
And what do you do
here the whole day?

1:03:17.417 --> 1:03:19.042
I'm fixing up the house.

1:03:20.167 --> 1:03:22.292
Yeah, I can see that.

1:03:23.792 --> 1:03:26.542
- And I keep bees. — what?

1:03:26.833 --> 1:03:28.333
Come, I'll show you.

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:46.417
Bernard?

1:03:46.708 --> 1:03:47.708
Hmm?

1:03:58.542 --> 1:04:00.875
I'm sorry about the thing
in the showers.

1:04:04.542 --> 1:04:06.042
I was a dick.

1:04:08.792 --> 1:04:10.333
Yes, you were.

1:04:18.250 --> 1:04:20.250
But you don't have to apologize.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.542
I really was looking at you.

1:04:48.333 --> 1:04:49.875
From the beginning.

1:05:11.875 --> 1:05:14.458
Won't you say anything?

1:05:15.250 --> 1:05:17.625
You can send me away,
but say something.

1:05:31.458 --> 1:05:32.875
What's wrong?

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:17.625
I can't do this.

1:08:27.958 --> 1:08:30.583
I think we should stop
work for a few days.

1:08:37.833 --> 1:08:40.875
I want to show Bernard
the countryside.

1:08:59.167 --> 1:09:00.708
What's wrong?

1:09:02.375 --> 1:09:04.333
Nothing, I'm just
taking the timber away.

1:09:10.167 --> 1:09:12.292
What did that guy come here for?

1:09:12.583 --> 1:09:13.583
Just because.

1:09:15.375 --> 1:09:16.708
To visit me.

1:09:21.458 --> 1:09:23.167
And what is he good at?

1:09:24.917 --> 1:09:26.250
What do you mean?

1:09:26.542 --> 1:09:29.083
Are you gonna pay him too,
or does he do it for free?

1:10:41.833 --> 1:10:43.042
What do you want?

1:10:43.417 --> 1:10:44.917
Is brigi at home?

1:10:46.125 --> 1:10:47.500
Not for you.

1:11:05.625 --> 1:11:07.708
Come, let's talk a little.

1:11:13.125 --> 1:11:15.833
Whether or not you're dating,
that's your business.

1:11:16.958 --> 1:11:19.083
But she was crying
the whole night.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:23.375
I don't want to watch
my sister crying herself

1:11:23.667 --> 1:11:25.792
to sleep because
of you ever again.

1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:28.333
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:30.167
I do.

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:32.458
Good.

1:11:34.708 --> 1:11:36.792
Then you stick
to that, you hear?

1:11:37.125 --> 1:11:37.792
All right.

1:11:38.125 --> 1:11:39.625
Wait a minute.

1:11:43.708 --> 1:11:46.125
Why do you keep going out
there to that kid?

1:11:46.417 --> 1:11:47.500
I work for him.

1:11:49.917 --> 1:11:52.042
You need the money,
and he has some.

1:11:53.375 --> 1:11:55.833
That's why you keep doing it.

1:11:57.625 --> 1:12:00.000
He pays you for it, doesn't he?

1:12:06.583 --> 1:12:08.667
You are sick.

1:12:11.583 --> 1:12:13.583
I can't accept this.

1:12:16.833 --> 1:12:18.625
This isn't even welding.

1:12:23.250 --> 1:12:25.042
Let's pretend I didn't see that.

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:31.083
Do I even have to
say that you fail?

1:12:35.167 --> 1:12:37.792
This isn't fitted
properly. Fail.

1:12:40.792 --> 1:12:42.375
Fail too.

1:13:09.708 --> 1:13:11.000
Open your mouth.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.250
Open your mouth
or I'll burn you.

1:13:50.458 --> 1:13:53.833
Cool it, I won't burn you.

1:15:02.625 --> 1:15:05.292
Mom, you'll get sick.

1:15:13.667 --> 1:15:15.083
Stop crying already.

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.250
They can't do this,
not to my son.

1:15:28.958 --> 1:15:31.208
I brought this upon myself,
it's all my fault.

1:15:42.875 --> 1:15:44.333
You told them.

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:47.583
How can you say that?

1:15:48.250 --> 1:15:50.542
I'd never tell anyone.

1:15:51.958 --> 1:15:53.375
But you did.

1:15:56.250 --> 1:15:58.375
Stop lying,
you fucking told them!

1:16:01.292 --> 1:16:02.292
Mom,

1:16:04.125 --> 1:16:05.458
look at me.

1:16:07.292 --> 1:16:10.042
Look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't you.

1:16:10.333 --> 1:16:12.792
It's a sin.
What you're doing is disgusting.

1:16:13.125 --> 1:16:16.167
But I'm good when I feed you
and do everything for you?

1:16:16.708 --> 1:16:19.417
I can take care
of myself on my own.

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:23.500
So do it.

1:18:01.125 --> 1:18:02.208
Who is that?

1:18:03.417 --> 1:18:04.625
I don't know.

1:18:09.292 --> 1:18:10.667
I'll have a look.

1:18:25.083 --> 1:18:26.083
Who is it?

1:18:26.750 --> 1:18:27.875
What?

1:19:33.417 --> 1:19:35.375
Why haven't you
told me about him?

1:19:49.750 --> 1:19:52.042
Why did you tell
me to come here?

1:19:53.542 --> 1:19:55.458
I came here only for you.

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:58.250
They could kick me out.

1:19:58.542 --> 1:20:00.708
I didn't say you had to come.

1:20:33.458 --> 1:20:34.875
Do you love him?

1:20:46.542 --> 1:20:47.875
I don't know.

1:21:01.542 --> 1:21:03.458
Are you coming back with me?

1:21:12.708 --> 1:21:16.042
He was beaten up because of me.

1:21:21.625 --> 1:21:24.083
I can't just leave
him here alone.

1:22:27.167 --> 1:22:29.833
I should get back soon,
or they'll really kick me out.

1:22:34.542 --> 1:22:35.583
Are you coming?

1:22:35.917 --> 1:22:37.833
Do we have to discuss this now?

1:22:42.125 --> 1:22:44.708
It's all the same.
Are you coming or not?

1:22:51.292 --> 1:22:53.208
What's your problem?

1:23:02.542 --> 1:23:05.500
Do you want to rot here, szabi?

1:23:07.375 --> 1:23:10.292
I only played football
because of my father.

1:23:12.792 --> 1:23:16.875
He was right. You could
play for the best teams.

1:23:18.667 --> 1:23:21.292
I won't beg them
to take me back.

1:23:27.375 --> 1:23:28.833
Well, you should.

1:23:31.625 --> 1:23:33.875
You belong there, not here.

1:23:43.917 --> 1:23:45.833
Szabi, come on in.

1:23:46.708 --> 1:23:48.333
I'm still looking for something.

1:23:48.625 --> 1:23:49.917
Come in already!

1:23:54.792 --> 1:23:56.000
It's so cold!

1:24:02.125 --> 1:24:04.708
You've talked him into it,
he's going back with you, right?

1:24:07.292 --> 1:24:09.000
What, you don't understand?

1:24:12.875 --> 1:24:15.333
I don't get what
you're blathering about.

1:24:29.833 --> 1:24:31.625
You think you're strong?

1:24:39.083 --> 1:24:40.667
Let him go already!

1:27:03.625 --> 1:27:05.042
Szabi.

1:27:08.333 --> 1:27:10.042
Let's get out of here.

1:27:14.083 --> 1:27:15.708
What's wrong?

1:27:17.417 --> 1:27:22.250
Let's go. The two of us.
Let's leave him.

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:36.417
You're not being serious.

1:27:37.875 --> 1:27:38.875
I am.

1:27:41.792 --> 1:27:43.167
Come with me.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.458
Make up your mind. Now.

1:28:00.167 --> 1:28:01.917
I've had enough of this.

1:28:11.542 --> 1:28:14.042
I can't leave him here.

1:30:11.625 --> 1:30:14.042
Get up. Get up.

1:30:18.458 --> 1:30:19.458
Come on.

1:30:35.792 --> 1:30:36.875
This is over, son.

1:31:09.875 --> 1:31:11.500
Dad, I'm staying here.

1:31:14.583 --> 1:31:16.000
I want to live here.

1:31:19.083 --> 1:31:20.458
With him.

1:32:34.750 --> 1:32:36.042
Aron,

1:32:37.292 --> 1:32:38.500
is that you?

1:32:49.917 --> 1:32:52.042
Where have you been, Sonny?

1:32:58.333 --> 1:33:00.042
Can you hear me?

1:33:03.125 --> 1:33:04.333
Aron!

1:33:35.750 --> 1:33:36.833
Mom!

1:34:37.542 --> 1:34:40.833
Lamb of god,

1:34:41.167 --> 1:34:45.750
who takes away
the sins of the world,

1:34:46.250 --> 1:34:49.792
have mercy on us.

1:34:50.375 --> 1:34:53.333
Lamb of god,

1:34:53.833 --> 1:34:58.625
who takes away
the sins of the world,

1:34:59.167 --> 1:35:03.542
Grant us peace.

1:35:05.375 --> 1:35:07.042
Behold the lamb of god,

1:35:07.417 --> 1:35:09.917
behold him who takes away
the sins of the world.

1:35:11.375 --> 1:35:14.792
Lord, I am not worthy that
you should come under my roof.

1:35:15.375 --> 1:35:19.333
But only speak the word,
and my soul shall be healed.

1:35:22.917 --> 1:35:24.750
You're gonna get fucked.

1:36:12.750 --> 1:36:14.042
Are you coming?

1:36:25.125 --> 1:36:26.250
Aron!

1:38:01.542 --> 1:38:03.542
Why did you have to
show up there today?

1:38:11.708 --> 1:38:13.417
Why, are you ashamed of me?

1:38:16.250 --> 1:38:17.333
Yes.

1:38:22.500 --> 1:38:24.333
I'm like this because of you.

1:38:24.708 --> 1:38:26.750
I'm sick of this whole thing.

1:38:37.417 --> 1:38:41.792
I only stayed here because of you.
But I'll go away if you want me to.

1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:11.583
I don't want to
see you ever again.
