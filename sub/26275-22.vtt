WEBVTT

00:03.941 --> 00:06.179
Hey, Kyle.

00:06.179 --> 00:07.749
Damn it.

00:09.318 --> 00:10.522
Kyle. Kyle!

00:10.522 --> 00:12.959
Here I am!

00:12.959 --> 00:14.696
(laughing)

00:14.696 --> 00:17.536
You had no idea where I was.

00:19.071 --> 00:22.378
No. Had I known, I would've
taped that box up.

00:24.282 --> 00:26.754
You haven't packed
any of this stuff up.

00:26.754 --> 00:29.425
Well, I started to,
but I took a long stroll

00:29.425 --> 00:31.429
down memory lane...

00:31.429 --> 00:34.570
when I found this.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.905
A hanger.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.809
Well, <i>the</i> hanger.

00:37.809 --> 00:39.546
From when I first moved in.
Remember?

00:39.546 --> 00:42.117
‐No.
‐Well, I used to leave my coat

00:42.117 --> 00:43.754
laying on the sofa all the time.
Remember?

00:43.754 --> 00:45.257
No.

00:45.257 --> 00:46.860
And you said, "Hang up your coat

00:46.860 --> 00:48.163
or I'm gonna smack you
in the head." Remember?

00:48.163 --> 00:50.668
Yes.

00:50.668 --> 00:52.672
Yeah, and I said, "Where am I
supposed to hang it up?"

00:52.672 --> 00:54.141
And you said, "In the closet."
And I said, "With what?"

00:54.141 --> 00:55.545
And you said, "A hanger."
And I said,

00:55.545 --> 00:57.716
"What hanger?"
And you said, "This hanger."

00:57.716 --> 01:00.020
<i>This</i> hanger.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.124
First off,
the hanger stays here.

01:02.124 --> 01:05.832
Message received,
you old softie.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.736
You got to pack
all this stuff up.

01:07.736 --> 01:10.173
This is why we had to cancel
the moving truck last week.

01:10.173 --> 01:12.011
I know.
I know, it's just...

01:12.011 --> 01:14.215
everything I pick up tells me
a beautiful story

01:14.215 --> 01:15.818
about my time here.

01:15.818 --> 01:19.291
I understand.
How about this?

01:19.291 --> 01:22.064
You pack it up real quick,
it'll tell you the same stories,

01:22.064 --> 01:25.370
even better ones as you're
unpacking it at your new house.

01:25.370 --> 01:27.842
‐All right. I'll get on it.
I promise.
‐Okay.

01:27.842 --> 01:30.548
Oh, um, would you ask Mandy
to give me a hand?

01:30.548 --> 01:33.119
Geez. Mandy. Mandy!

01:33.119 --> 01:35.123
Here I am!

01:40.267 --> 01:42.304
♪ ♪

01:47.181 --> 01:49.953
You know, Air Force Academy
food is good,

01:49.953 --> 01:51.557
but there's something about
a meal at home

01:51.557 --> 01:53.561
‐that just tastes
so much better.
‐Yep.

01:53.561 --> 01:55.932
Well, you're old enough
I can tell you the secret:

01:55.932 --> 01:57.702
I use obscene amounts of butter.

01:59.205 --> 02:01.677
‐Oh, I love special occasions.
Morning.
‐Morning.

02:01.677 --> 02:05.450
Hey. Because there's waffles
and I don't have to cook them.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.854
‐That's right.
‐(chuckles)

02:06.854 --> 02:08.591
You can cook them anytime
you want,

02:08.591 --> 02:09.860
just not on the waffle maker

02:09.860 --> 02:11.997
that my dad passed on to me.

02:11.997 --> 02:13.701
You know, Mike, my grandmother
passed me down

02:13.701 --> 02:16.807
a loom.
Doesn't mean I have to use it.

02:16.807 --> 02:19.411
That's because a loom is stupid.

02:19.411 --> 02:21.215
(scoffs)

02:21.215 --> 02:24.723
This thing's got generations
of Baxter family flavor

02:24.723 --> 02:26.025
baked right into it.

02:26.025 --> 02:28.429
Ew. You said it was butter.

02:28.429 --> 02:31.435
Make all the jokes you want,
but this is a big day for me.

02:31.435 --> 02:33.574
This is when my nearly
30‐year‐old daughter

02:33.574 --> 02:37.381
‐and her husband
move out of the house.
‐Mm. (chuckles)

02:37.381 --> 02:40.053
Well, in that case,
I am opening champagne.

02:40.053 --> 02:42.257
Uh, I'm adding orange juice.

02:42.257 --> 02:44.161
I'm not a lush.

02:44.161 --> 02:45.330
As long as we're celebrating,

02:45.330 --> 02:46.800
I'm gonna add some more
chocolate chips,

02:46.800 --> 02:50.140
making this waffle
one step closer to cake.

02:51.175 --> 02:52.477
Honey, aren't you upset?

02:52.477 --> 02:53.848
You're finally home
for the summer

02:53.848 --> 02:55.551
and your sister's leaving?

02:55.551 --> 02:57.321
She's like the sun.

02:57.321 --> 02:58.924
I enjoy her from a distance,

02:58.924 --> 03:02.532
but if you spend too much with
her, you'll suffer a stroke.

03:02.532 --> 03:05.103
Ooh, champagne and orange juice.

03:05.103 --> 03:09.044
That's called an Omarosa.

03:09.044 --> 03:12.284
Actually, that would be
champagne and sour grapes.

03:12.284 --> 03:14.288
‐Ooh.
‐(chuckles)

03:14.288 --> 03:17.562
Ah, waffles. One of the most
memorable smells.

03:17.562 --> 03:19.164
‐MIKE: Mm‐hmm.
‐You know, it's like
fresh cut grass

03:19.164 --> 03:22.037
or gasoline covering the trailer
right before your mom

03:22.037 --> 03:24.408
files an insurance claim.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.613
You know, the key to making
a great waffle

03:26.613 --> 03:29.786
is hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

03:29.786 --> 03:32.157
It's almost the opposite
of how it is in your artery.

03:32.157 --> 03:34.295
‐It's just...
‐All right.

03:34.295 --> 03:36.299
Sit down, guys. Why don't I get
some breakfast in you

03:36.299 --> 03:37.802
‐before the
moving truck arrives?
‐Yep.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.873
Oh, actually, we canceled that.

03:39.873 --> 03:41.843
This will be the third time
you've canceled this thing.

03:41.843 --> 03:43.346
‐What's going on?
‐No, now, hey, hey, hey.

03:43.346 --> 03:44.616
Maybe they have a good reason.

03:44.616 --> 03:47.287
Which I would really
love to hear.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.224
Yeah. We‐we ordered
some curtains,

03:49.224 --> 03:50.728
and we thought we'd wait
till they got delivered.

03:50.728 --> 03:52.699
We don't want people peeking in.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.938
Trust me. Nobody
wants to watch you and Kyle

03:55.938 --> 03:58.544
try to program a stove clock.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.319
Heh.

04:06.994 --> 04:08.329
Hey, Ed?

04:08.329 --> 04:09.933
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

04:09.933 --> 04:11.636
No, no, no.
Did you see a customer

04:11.636 --> 04:14.308
who drove off
in a cherry red convertible?

04:14.308 --> 04:15.443
Oh. I don't know.
Did he hit something?

04:15.443 --> 04:16.479
No, no, no, no, no.

04:16.479 --> 04:17.815
How do you think I would look

04:17.815 --> 04:19.552
in a cherry red convertible?

04:19.552 --> 04:22.024
Okay, we‐we need to talk

04:22.024 --> 04:24.629
about the word "emergency".

04:24.629 --> 04:27.535
‐(indistinct chatter)
‐Yoo‐hoo. Anybody want a muffin?

04:27.535 --> 04:31.108
‐Ooh. Absolutely.
‐Someone was up
all night baking.

04:31.108 --> 04:34.181
And then I bought some
from the bakery.

04:34.181 --> 04:36.118
‐Mmm. Mmm.
‐What's that?

04:36.118 --> 04:38.991
‐The whole thing tastes
just like the top.
‐Mmm.

04:38.991 --> 04:42.030
And that granola bar in my desk
can go kiss my ass.

04:42.030 --> 04:45.704
(laughs)
I'm so glad you guys like them.

04:45.704 --> 04:48.042
Uh, hey. Are you guys
gonna be here tomorrow?

04:48.042 --> 04:49.612
‐Mm‐hmm. All day.
‐Great.

04:49.612 --> 04:52.017
Uh, Boyd's school
is doing their spring musical,

04:52.017 --> 04:54.021
so he's gonna come in with me
and do some fund‐raising.

04:54.021 --> 04:57.862
Seems like he was just here
for <i>Peter Pan.</i>
‐(chuckles)

04:57.862 --> 04:59.933
Yep. Uh, this year
they're doing <i>Music Man.</i>

04:59.933 --> 05:01.503
He's so excited to tell
you guys about it.

05:01.503 --> 05:04.041
Have a great day.
Thanks, bye.

05:04.041 --> 05:07.147
(chuckles) I knew
this muffin would cost me.

05:07.147 --> 05:08.851
(grunts)

05:08.851 --> 05:11.890
Last year he talked me into
that "Tiger Lily" package.

05:11.890 --> 05:15.898
‐Mmm.
‐200 bucks for
a signed cast photo

05:15.898 --> 05:19.304
and a room temperature soda
at intermission.

05:19.304 --> 05:22.912
This year...
I'm not gonna do it.

05:22.912 --> 05:24.081
What?

05:24.081 --> 05:27.254
Yeah. He asks me to donate?

05:27.254 --> 05:29.158
I'm gonna say no.

05:29.158 --> 05:31.997
Wow. But...
but that's Mike's grandson.

05:31.997 --> 05:35.938
‐Yeah.
‐He‐he doesn't realize
that the kid's a jackass.

05:35.938 --> 05:38.075
I don't give a damn.

05:38.075 --> 05:39.946
I'm done.

05:39.946 --> 05:42.150
All right.
Me too.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.854
I'm not gonna bankroll
that kid anymore.

05:43.854 --> 05:45.558
‐Yeah.
‐All right? Yeah, right.
(chuckles)

05:45.558 --> 05:48.229
And I'm talking all these
bribe muffins.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.805
We got to get rid
of these sponges.

05:52.805 --> 05:54.976
Really?
I just bought those.

05:54.976 --> 05:56.980
No.
I mean Kyle and Mandy.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.690
Yeah. Well, uh, you know,
they'll be gone soon enough.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.560
It's‐it's like Mandy
in high school:

06:03.560 --> 06:07.400
‐dicey for a while,
but she got out.
‐Right...

06:07.400 --> 06:08.804
She even said it herself.

06:08.804 --> 06:10.841
She's not feeling any pressure
to move out.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.511
I want to put some
pressure on her.

06:12.511 --> 06:14.716
Okay. What‐what do you
want me to say?

06:14.716 --> 06:16.485
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

06:16.485 --> 06:18.489
I‐I realize we attract more
flies with honey than vinegar,

06:18.489 --> 06:21.730
but we want to get rid
of the flies.

06:21.730 --> 06:23.634
‐I can be tough.
‐Honey.

06:25.938 --> 06:27.407
(chuckles)

06:30.146 --> 06:32.484
I don't like
watching old movies.

06:32.484 --> 06:34.656
Everybody who was in them
is dead.

06:34.656 --> 06:37.561
‐Like, see that adorable kid?
‐Mm‐hmm.

06:37.561 --> 06:39.331
Dead.

06:39.331 --> 06:41.402
Hey, uh, could you guys

06:41.402 --> 06:44.241
turn that off for just a second?

06:44.241 --> 06:46.245
All right, listen up.
I've been thinking about this,

06:46.245 --> 06:49.786
and if you guys don't want
to move into the apartment,

06:49.786 --> 06:51.823
I'm gonna have to find
another tenant.

06:51.823 --> 06:53.159
Wait, what are you
talking about?

06:53.159 --> 06:56.098
You know what
he's talking about.

07:04.515 --> 07:06.586
We spent a lot of money
fixing that place up,

07:06.586 --> 07:08.657
and I think we've done
a great job.

07:08.657 --> 07:10.126
And if you guys
aren't gonna move in,

07:10.126 --> 07:11.696
I'm gonna
put it back on the market,

07:11.696 --> 07:14.267
so I'm saying you're gonna have
to move in tomorrow.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.539
Well, Dad you're‐you're putting
us under a lot of pressure.

07:16.539 --> 07:19.211
‐I know.
‐We know!

07:24.956 --> 07:27.828
Well, I... I mean, I guess,
when you put it that way,

07:27.828 --> 07:29.064
we don't really have a choice.

07:29.064 --> 07:30.768
Exactly.

07:30.768 --> 07:31.903
Rent it to someone else.

07:36.546 --> 07:39.050
‐What?
‐No... You...

07:39.050 --> 07:41.021
You realize you're gonna
lose the apartment.

07:41.021 --> 07:43.527
‐I know.
‐We know!

07:48.269 --> 07:50.072
Hey, let's go unpack, babe.

07:50.072 --> 07:52.410
I still get to use the hanger.

07:55.784 --> 07:58.088
Wow.

07:58.088 --> 08:01.161
I know this is probably
too late, but, um...

08:01.161 --> 08:02.565
I don't want to have kids.

08:09.110 --> 08:10.848
<i>VANESSA:</i>
<i>Oh, I thought</i>

08:10.848 --> 08:14.120
this would be the last gallon
I'd have to buy.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.791
You know, that,
you know, I‐I could be

08:15.791 --> 08:18.229
one of those elegant women
who buys her milk

08:18.229 --> 08:21.603
one skinny quart at time.

08:21.603 --> 08:24.441
But Mandy and Kyle
are staying,

08:24.441 --> 08:28.315
so I guess I'm still
"Ugly Jugs" Vanessa.

08:31.723 --> 08:34.695
Honey... your jugs
are beautiful.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.300
Hey.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.004
‐Ooh, actually...
‐Uh‐uh‐uh...

08:39.004 --> 08:40.273
What? I'm thirsty.

08:40.273 --> 08:42.645
Drink water.
Milk is for movers.

08:44.615 --> 08:47.387
I think what your father
is trying to say is

08:47.387 --> 08:49.959
what the hell are you and Kyle
still doing here?

08:49.959 --> 08:52.831
Hey, hey. (chuckles)
I can't wait to get out of here.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.535
Right back at ya.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.938
The problem is this family is

08:55.938 --> 08:58.777
too loving and too supportive.

08:58.777 --> 09:00.581
Boy. That's gonna be
an interesting call

09:00.581 --> 09:02.116
to social services.

09:03.687 --> 09:06.391
Well, you guys know Kyle
grew up with an alcoholic mom

09:06.391 --> 09:07.828
in a condemned trailer.

09:07.828 --> 09:09.899
And then he comes here
to a... to a caring,

09:09.899 --> 09:11.301
supportive family.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.940
I‐I think maybe
he wants more of that.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.445
Well, does explain why Kyle's
been dragging his heels.

09:16.445 --> 09:18.248
‐I mean, it's kind of sweet.
‐Yeah.

09:18.248 --> 09:21.388
So I created a wonderful home
and family

09:21.388 --> 09:23.225
and, once again,

09:23.225 --> 09:25.931
being too good at something
bites me in the ass.

09:25.931 --> 09:29.037
Yeah, and those
three pregnancies

09:29.037 --> 09:32.544
hardly took any toll at all
on your figure.

09:36.351 --> 09:38.222
‐Retail area.
‐Uh‐huh?

09:38.222 --> 09:40.426
There's a guy in a black leather
jacket with lots of buckles.

09:40.426 --> 09:41.428
‐Uh.
‐Lots of buckles.

09:41.428 --> 09:42.564
‐Got him.
‐Uh‐huh.

09:42.564 --> 09:44.167
‐Did you see him lift something?
‐No, no, no.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.606
Do you think I could pull off
a coat like that?

09:46.606 --> 09:49.879
Only in
a cherry red convertible.

09:49.879 --> 09:52.183
(chuckles)

09:52.183 --> 09:54.622
Oh, uh, okay. Uh‐oh.
Boyd's here.

09:54.622 --> 09:56.859
‐It's happening.
‐Huh. Oh.

09:56.859 --> 09:58.763
What‐what, wait, wait, wait.

09:58.763 --> 10:01.168
That's the first place
he'll look for you. Come on.

10:05.376 --> 10:06.378
‐Okay.
‐Yeah.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.987
Shh, shh.

10:12.023 --> 10:15.196
Ed? Chuck?

10:15.196 --> 10:17.701
Hey, where are you guys?

10:17.701 --> 10:20.239
It's a perfect idea.

10:20.239 --> 10:23.078
This way he can't shake down
people he can't find.

10:23.078 --> 10:26.919
Yeah. You know,
I stared down the Iraqi army.

10:26.919 --> 10:29.357
Now I'm hiding
from a peewee music man.

10:31.328 --> 10:34.400
But the Iraqi army
wasn't singing show tunes.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.338
(phone ringing)

10:36.338 --> 10:37.741
Come on, stop that.

10:37.741 --> 10:39.712
‐Come on, cut it, cut it,
cut it, cut it.
‐I got it. Whoa.

10:39.712 --> 10:42.551
Ooh.

10:42.551 --> 10:43.553
I got it.

10:43.553 --> 10:45.891
Turn the damn thing...

10:45.891 --> 10:47.628
‐There it is. Okay.
‐Turn the damn thing off.

10:49.397 --> 10:50.734
What are you guys doing?

10:50.734 --> 10:53.773
‐Chuck just dropped his phone.
‐Uh...

10:53.773 --> 10:56.311
Why is it so dark in here?

10:56.311 --> 10:58.683
‐Uh, because the lights
aren't on.
‐Yeah.

10:58.683 --> 11:00.620
‐Ed, Ed, I told you,
turn the lights on.
‐Okay.

11:02.456 --> 11:05.496
‐Whoa. It's bright.
‐Let me ask you
a question, fellas.

11:05.496 --> 11:06.532
‐Yeah?
‐Yeah?

11:06.532 --> 11:09.204
Do you love love?

11:09.204 --> 11:12.009
BOTH:
Yes.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.915
Well, then, you're going
to love the story

11:14.915 --> 11:17.721
of a flimflam man
who travels town to town

11:17.721 --> 11:19.190
selling musical instruments

11:19.190 --> 11:22.430
till one thing gets in his way.

11:22.430 --> 11:24.434
What do you think that is?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.939
BOTH:
Love.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.220
What's with the picnic basket?

11:34.220 --> 11:37.193
We usually go to the woods
with guns.

11:37.193 --> 11:40.667
This is for Kyle.
He's having a hard time leaving.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.506
Then take him to the woods
with guns.

11:43.506 --> 11:47.748
Your father has agreed to let me
explain to Kyle

11:47.748 --> 11:50.654
‐that family is family
no matter where he lives.
‐MIKE: Right.

11:50.654 --> 11:51.989
You know, sometimes
I just prefer

11:51.989 --> 11:53.793
to rip the Band‐Aid off,
all right?

11:53.793 --> 11:56.899
Damn it, I don't even like
putting Band‐Aids on.

11:56.899 --> 11:59.270
You'll see, you'll see.
Once I talk to Kyle,

11:59.270 --> 12:01.776
he will realize on his own
that it's time to go.

12:01.776 --> 12:03.378
Right. Or he'll just
wait us out,

12:03.378 --> 12:05.583
take the master bedroom
after we die.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.057
Then I'll take him
to the woods with guns.

12:09.057 --> 12:10.961
What?

12:10.961 --> 12:14.167
Uh, Kyle... Hey.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.438
Uh, I packed this picnic basket

12:16.438 --> 12:18.475
full of all
your favorite snacks.

12:18.475 --> 12:20.714
‐My favorite snac...
‐Yeah.

12:20.714 --> 12:22.851
I thought they discontinued
making choco‐balls

12:22.851 --> 12:26.926
like ten years ago
because they caused "lesions."

12:26.926 --> 12:29.531
Heh. No, no, no, no.
No choco‐balls. Okay, so...

12:29.531 --> 12:33.171
Um, I just thought that
maybe you and Mandy

12:33.171 --> 12:35.175
could take the picnic
basket outside,

12:35.175 --> 12:39.017
and you could realize that
food tastes just as good

12:39.017 --> 12:40.653
no matter where you eat it.

12:40.653 --> 12:43.025
That's not true.
I mean, there's something

12:43.025 --> 12:45.029
that's just so magical
about your kitchen,

12:45.029 --> 12:47.801
and nobody beats
Mr. B's waffles.

12:49.237 --> 12:50.607
That's very nice, but, uh, but

12:50.607 --> 12:52.076
what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

12:52.076 --> 12:53.880
The only thing that my mom
cooked in the kitchen was

12:53.880 --> 12:55.750
this weird stuff
that made her friends

12:55.750 --> 12:59.290
really excited
to clean the trailer.

12:59.290 --> 13:01.361
Yeah, uh...

13:01.361 --> 13:03.833
look, I realize your childhood

13:03.833 --> 13:05.670
wasn't exactly ideal...

13:05.670 --> 13:09.010
Yeah, but it's okay now,
'cause living here with you guys

13:09.010 --> 13:12.383
has been the happiest time
of my life.

13:12.383 --> 13:15.289
Which is why I'm not sure
I'm ever gonna leave.

13:17.293 --> 13:18.261
Mike.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.710
Listen, Kyle, I'm gonna get
ahold of the moving van.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.048
It'll be here in an hour.
Your stuff's gonna be in it

13:28.048 --> 13:29.918
or in the front yard.

13:29.918 --> 13:31.922
Now, get out.

13:34.695 --> 13:37.366
That Band‐Aid had
a little hair on it.

13:47.419 --> 13:51.060
I can't believe I have my own
beautiful, perfect apartment.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.933
I want to kick you guys
out of here so badly.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.870
Okay, well, a few
last‐minute things.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.439
Uh, the curtains will
be in tomorrow.

13:57.439 --> 14:00.279
Oh, and there is a bus that
stops by every few days

14:00.279 --> 14:02.851
because we are on
the "Haunted Denver" tour.

14:02.851 --> 14:05.022
Prison murder.
Don't ask.

14:05.022 --> 14:07.259
Oh, where do you want
the bowling balls?

14:08.428 --> 14:09.998
That's the last one.

14:09.998 --> 14:12.203
Now all that's left
is back surgery

14:12.203 --> 14:14.908
and three months
of physical therapy.

14:14.908 --> 14:16.645
Hey, how about your new landlord
buys everybody lunch

14:16.645 --> 14:18.348
at the Grill?

14:18.348 --> 14:20.920
I can get us a good table.
I sleep with the manager.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.360
(chuckles)
Oh, don't tell her I said that.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.166
Maybe Dad could join us.
He likes to pay for things.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.036
Actually, I'm‐I'm not hungry.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.274
‐I think I'll just
get started unpacking.
‐Okay.

14:31.274 --> 14:33.211
What about you, Eve?

14:33.211 --> 14:35.148
Uh, I think I'll hang here, too.

14:35.148 --> 14:37.587
I lost my appetite
when I fused my spine.

14:40.660 --> 14:43.733
Kyle, um, I think
you and I need to talk.

14:43.733 --> 14:47.273
You know, Baxter son
to Baxter son.

14:47.273 --> 14:51.014
Apparently I'm not a Baxter son.

14:52.751 --> 14:55.556
Which... which I suppose
is a good thing,

14:55.556 --> 14:57.126
since I'm married
to a Baxter daughter,

14:57.126 --> 15:00.733
and that would be,
you know... disgusting.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.138
Well, Dad thinks of you
as a son.

15:03.138 --> 15:05.777
Oh, yeah?

15:05.777 --> 15:07.614
Sure has a funny way
of showing it.

15:07.614 --> 15:11.120
Well, he has a funny way
of showing most things.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.160
You kind of have to learn
how to read him.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.431
He kicked me out.
An‐And I don't know why.

15:16.431 --> 15:17.901
I don't know what I did wrong.

15:17.901 --> 15:19.671
You didn't do anything wrong.

15:19.671 --> 15:21.842
That's why he kicked you out.
Don't you get that?

15:21.842 --> 15:23.546
Okay, this might be
a little late in the game

15:23.546 --> 15:25.382
for me to ask this,
since, you know,

15:25.382 --> 15:27.921
‐I'm married into
the family and all.
‐Yeah. Mm‐hmm.

15:27.921 --> 15:30.626
But... are you people insane?

15:32.664 --> 15:35.068
Kyle, he knew it was time
for you to move out.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.672
He knew you were ready.

15:36.672 --> 15:38.341
That's why,
when he found out

15:38.341 --> 15:40.847
that you weren't going
to pull the trigger, he did.

15:40.847 --> 15:42.751
And if there's one thing
Dad knows,

15:42.751 --> 15:45.990
it's... it's when to pull
the trigger.

15:45.990 --> 15:47.861
I guess that's true.

15:47.861 --> 15:49.765
Of course it's true.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.802
And you want to know
another thing that's true?

15:51.802 --> 15:54.508
You think you moving out
is hard on you?

15:54.508 --> 15:57.146
Trust me,
it's way harder on Dad.

15:58.883 --> 16:00.653
You think so?

16:00.653 --> 16:02.222
I do.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.493
That's why I know how
to read him.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.067
You're a good brother, Eve.

16:10.305 --> 16:12.510
You think you could teach me
how to read?

16:12.510 --> 16:14.346
Sure.

16:16.919 --> 16:19.056
You mean my dad, right?

16:22.897 --> 16:26.237
Hey, guys, I'm back.

16:26.237 --> 16:30.078
Me, too, and I brought
more muffins.

16:30.078 --> 16:33.184
Now, Ed, you bought
the "Shipoopi" package.

16:33.184 --> 16:35.957
That gives you four tickets
to each performance,

16:35.957 --> 16:38.094
and a special lunch
with the cast.

16:38.094 --> 16:41.869
I know what I did.

16:41.869 --> 16:44.708
‐And, Mr. Larabee.
Now, now this is my favorite.
‐Mm.

16:44.708 --> 16:47.045
‐You get...
‐To build a gazebo.

16:47.045 --> 16:49.718
I know.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.755
Oh, you're gonna need
an insurance waiver.

16:51.755 --> 16:55.328
What?
An insurance waiver?

16:55.328 --> 16:57.232
(chuckles)
If it helps, uh,

16:57.232 --> 16:59.270
we have to host the cast party.

16:59.270 --> 17:01.942
46 drama nerds spilling soda
and spreading it

17:01.942 --> 17:05.215
all over my house
with their jazz hands.

17:05.215 --> 17:07.587
I just bought myself
another year

17:07.587 --> 17:10.626
to try to figure out
how to say no to that kid.

17:10.626 --> 17:12.931
Next year they're doing <i>Cats.</i>

17:12.931 --> 17:15.903
‐(sighs)
‐Oh, for the love of God.

17:15.903 --> 17:17.439
A‐Am I gonna have to build
some kind of

17:17.439 --> 17:19.109
giant litter box or something?

17:21.047 --> 17:22.584
‐Hey, guys.
‐Hey, hey, Jen, Jen, Jen.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.923
Don't take this the wrong way,
but get out.

17:25.923 --> 17:28.294
Boyd's gonna get here
any second.

17:28.294 --> 17:30.566
He's fundraising
for his new play, so get...

17:30.566 --> 17:32.135
Hey, that's my kid.
But he's right.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.672
You should totally
just leave right now. Just go.

17:33.672 --> 17:34.741
ED:
It's too late, too late,

17:34.741 --> 17:36.377
‐too late.
‐Oh, Jen, great.

17:36.377 --> 17:38.047
Let me ask you a question.

17:38.047 --> 17:41.087
‐Do you love love?
‐Why?

17:41.087 --> 17:43.692
Because if you do, you're going
to love <i>The Music Man.</i>

17:43.692 --> 17:45.930
‐It's the story of a guy...
‐Stop.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.600
‐What?
‐Not interested.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.908
‐But don't you want to know...
‐I do not.

17:54.814 --> 17:56.283
But it‐it's a musical.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.490
Yeah, people don't like those.

18:01.227 --> 18:02.530
Let's go, Boyd.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.768
Uh... think we're done here.

18:04.768 --> 18:06.738
(chuckles)

18:06.738 --> 18:09.343
That is the most amazing thing

18:09.343 --> 18:10.880
I've ever seen.

18:12.015 --> 18:14.086
You don't seem to feel
any guilt.

18:14.086 --> 18:15.656
How d‐how did you do that?

18:15.656 --> 18:18.394
Well, I'll tell you.
Right after I tell you

18:18.394 --> 18:21.702
about the geology club, which is
raising money for a field trip.

18:27.179 --> 18:30.151
You two strike me
as the type who would be...

18:30.151 --> 18:31.454
Limestone Members.

18:32.757 --> 18:34.426
Hey, you got a check...

18:39.203 --> 18:41.742
Hello?

18:41.742 --> 18:44.046
Hey, Kyle. Kyle.

18:44.046 --> 18:45.716
In the box?

18:46.785 --> 18:49.289
Oh, hey, Mr. B.

18:49.289 --> 18:50.860
Hey, buddy.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.632
You know, this place is starting
to look pretty good.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.203
Yeah, yeah, it's starting
to feel like home.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.874
That's because it is a home.

18:57.874 --> 18:59.511
Can I get you anything?

18:59.511 --> 19:02.683
No, but, uh,
I brought you something.

19:08.929 --> 19:10.064
This is yours.

19:10.064 --> 19:12.002
Yeah. Family heirloom.

19:12.002 --> 19:15.643
Oh. Cool. I'll‐I'll tell Mandy
you brought it by for her.

19:15.643 --> 19:19.082
Actually, uh,
I brought it for you, Kyle.

19:20.218 --> 19:21.855
‐Really?
‐You, uh...

19:21.855 --> 19:24.493
Vanessa's got a loom, but...
that's stupid.

19:26.063 --> 19:28.535
Heirloom good.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.541
A loom, stupid.

19:31.541 --> 19:34.379
‐Thank you, Mr. B.
‐Mm‐hmm.

19:34.379 --> 19:36.250
Any time you want a waffle,
you come by.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.889
Okay. Listen, I, uh...

19:38.889 --> 19:40.893
I should get back to work.

19:40.893 --> 19:43.264
A‐And do you remember
how I like the waffles?

19:43.264 --> 19:46.203
Hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

19:46.203 --> 19:48.575
You know how to read me.

20:03.639 --> 20:05.709
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

20:05.709 --> 20:09.483
reminding you that the outdoors
has much to teach us.

20:09.483 --> 20:12.455
For example, you know one thing
you'll never see in nature?

20:12.455 --> 20:15.495
A millennial
still living at home.

20:15.495 --> 20:18.635
And you know why?
It isn't good for them.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.173
Buy your own damn milk.

20:22.677 --> 20:24.313
You see,
it really doesn't matter

20:24.313 --> 20:26.651
if the teat is attached
to your mom,

20:26.651 --> 20:29.323
an almond or the government.

20:29.323 --> 20:31.193
If you suckle at it
for too long,

20:31.193 --> 20:33.598
you won't know how to be
a grown‐up in the real world.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.101
Of course, in nature,

20:35.101 --> 20:38.441
the parents don't mess around.

20:38.441 --> 20:41.748
Birds will just launch the kid
out of the nest.

20:41.748 --> 20:44.854
They don't even check to see if
the dude can fly. They're like,

20:44.854 --> 20:46.891
"Well, you got a couple seconds
to figure it out,

20:46.891 --> 20:49.296
otherwise you're gonna
get eaten down there."

20:50.666 --> 20:52.503
With people,
it's a little trickier.

20:52.503 --> 20:53.872
Especially the‐the people

20:53.872 --> 20:56.410
your very loving wife
gave birth to.

20:56.410 --> 20:58.815
If you're really lucky, your
grown‐up kid who lives at home

20:58.815 --> 21:01.387
will get married, and you get
to take in a stray.

21:02.690 --> 21:06.463
It's like
birth one, get one free.

21:06.463 --> 21:09.036
You ever see those videos
where the goat folds in

21:09.036 --> 21:12.308
with the family dogs
until he thinks he's a dog?

21:12.308 --> 21:14.379
Well... (imitates goat)

21:14.379 --> 21:16.851
...we had a goat.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.955
He thought he was one of us.

21:18.955 --> 21:21.528
Thought he was one of us.
(chuckles)

21:21.528 --> 21:24.534
<i>And I hope that he knows</i>
<i>that he is</i>

21:24.534 --> 21:26.336
<i>and always will be.</i>

21:26.336 --> 21:28.842
<i>Baxter out.</i>

21:38.895 --> 21:40.398
<i>(chicken clucks)</i>

21:40.398 --> 21:42.435
