00:01.690 --> 00:04.009
Kids, I'll never forget
the first time

00:04.011 --> 00:05.679
I told your mother I loved her.

00:05.681 --> 00:07.697
It was a rainy day in New York.

00:07.699 --> 00:09.049
<i>We just had a horrible lunch.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.017
<i>The movie we wanted to see</i>
<i>was sold out,</i>

00:11.019 --> 00:12.102
<i>and I just looked at her</i>

00:12.104 --> 00:15.004
<i>and said, "I love you."</i>

00:15.006 --> 00:16.423
<i>It was a big deal for me.</i>

00:16.425 --> 00:19.025
<i>I hadn't said that</i>
<i>to a girl since...</i>

00:19.027 --> 00:20.811
I love you, Robin.

00:20.813 --> 00:23.363
I'm serious.

00:24.515 --> 00:27.317
Do you remember why we
broke up in the first place?

00:27.319 --> 00:28.618
We asked each other,
"Where do you want

00:28.620 --> 00:29.770
<i>to be in five years?"</i>

00:29.772 --> 00:32.989
<i>And our answers</i>
<i>were just too different.</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.357
Well, it's
five years later,

00:34.359 --> 00:37.544
and where are we?

00:37.546 --> 00:39.379
Standing on the roof

00:39.381 --> 00:42.198
<i>where I kissed you</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

00:43.468 --> 00:46.303
I know this is
a lot to process,

00:46.305 --> 00:48.472
so no pressure here.

00:48.474 --> 00:52.058
Just... what do you think?

00:53.094 --> 00:54.544
You know what?
You're exhausted, it's late.

00:54.546 --> 00:55.545
Let's just go to sleep.

00:55.547 --> 00:56.713
Well, good night.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.985
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

01:01.987 --> 01:03.487
<i>Okay, I can fix this.</i>

01:03.489 --> 01:07.707
I-I was just temporarily insane
<i>because of my Lyme disease,</i>

01:07.709 --> 01:12.712
<i>which I got on a camping trip</i>
<i>that I didn't tell her about</i>

01:12.714 --> 01:17.751
<i>because... I go camping</i>
<i>in secret.</i>

01:17.753 --> 01:19.586
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:19.588 --> 01:21.671
<i>Or I could say, "I'm sorry,</i>
<i>we're great as friends.</i>

01:21.673 --> 01:23.290
<i>Let's just forget</i>
<i>I ever said anything."</i>

01:23.292 --> 01:24.291
<i>Yeah, that's probably better.</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:26.376
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

01:29.246 --> 01:32.248
I go camping in secret.

Wow, Ted, I...
wow, okay.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.290
You got to give
me a minute here.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.157
Yeah, of course.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.210
Okay, um, we need to
t-talk about this.

02:01.212 --> 02:04.580
This time yesterday,
I was in Vermont

02:04.582 --> 02:06.049
engaged to another man.

02:06.051 --> 02:10.053
I mean, it's been 24 hours
of emotional mayhem,

02:10.055 --> 02:12.088
and, and the day
is still not over.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.589
I mean, I swear
to God,

02:13.591 --> 02:15.308
if there's any more surprises,
I'm gonna hit someone!

02:16.311 --> 02:18.961
... comrade.

02:19.796 --> 02:21.097
That means,

02:21.099 --> 02:22.982
"Hello, coworker."

02:22.984 --> 02:24.967
You ready for our trip
to Mother Russia?

02:24.969 --> 02:27.870
<i>Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin</i>
<i>was thrilled World Wide News</i>

02:27.872 --> 02:29.822
<i>asked her to go to Moscow</i>
<i>to cover Maslenitsa.</i>

02:29.824 --> 02:31.357
<i>She was less thrilled</i>
<i>to discover</i>

02:31.359 --> 02:34.243
<i>Maslenitsa is the city's</i>
<i>annual butter festival.</i>

02:34.245 --> 02:36.746
<i>Even worse, she'd spend</i>
<i>an entire week with all those</i>

02:36.748 --> 02:40.400
<i>buttery Russians</i>
<i>and her archenemy Patrice.</i>

02:40.402 --> 02:44.854
Uh, our flight leaves
at 9:00 p.m., not a.m.

02:44.856 --> 02:47.540
God... Patrice!

02:47.542 --> 02:49.658
But, Robin,
the schedule says 9:00 a.m.

02:49.660 --> 02:51.377
and my ticket says 9:00 a.m.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.513
and all the e-mail reminders
said 9:00 a.m.

02:53.515 --> 02:55.381
and our boss in the car
downstairs said...

02:55.383 --> 02:56.682
Okay, Patrice, I get it!

02:56.684 --> 02:57.850
Oh, no!

02:57.852 --> 02:59.469
Pair of pants
coming in hot!

02:59.471 --> 03:00.686
Noise-canceling
headphones.

03:00.688 --> 03:02.138
Oh, I don't need 'em.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.223
It's a ten-hour flight and
your sitting next to Patrice.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.675
Oh, God,
where's my cough syrup?

03:06.677 --> 03:07.794
You're gonna make it.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.011
I'll bring
your bag down.

03:09.013 --> 03:10.696
Where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?!

03:10.698 --> 03:12.281
Don't worry. It's fine.

03:12.283 --> 03:13.483
And look, about all this...
Just go.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.850
Good-bye.
Bye.

03:17.671 --> 03:19.789
Why didn't I kiss her?

03:22.359 --> 03:24.660
We'll continue this
when I get back.

03:34.221 --> 03:35.388
Hello.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.672
I know it's early,

03:36.674 --> 03:38.591
but can you meet me
at the bar right now, alone?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.042
I'm on my way.

03:40.044 --> 03:41.561
I got to meet Ted
at the bar.

03:41.563 --> 03:43.095
It's 7:00 a.m.

03:43.097 --> 03:47.099
Man, Ted really needs to work
on his boundaries.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.218
Shh, guys, seriously.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.488
Why are you in our bed?

03:52.490 --> 03:55.741
I took the drunk train
and got stuck out here.

03:55.743 --> 03:58.227
Oh, God, I am so hungover.

03:58.229 --> 04:01.030
Oh, God,
Lily's not wearing a bra!

04:01.032 --> 04:02.448
Shh!

04:02.450 --> 04:04.534
Bye, baby.

04:06.236 --> 04:07.837
Do you think...?

04:07.839 --> 04:09.589
Okay, I already know
I don't want to hear this.

04:09.591 --> 04:11.424
Do you think
that if we did it...

04:11.426 --> 04:13.242
Yeah, I was right.
I don't want to hear this.

04:13.244 --> 04:15.261
...and I did
a really good job...

04:15.263 --> 04:16.512
Please leave.

04:16.514 --> 04:20.416
...that I could turn that
into my baby?

04:20.418 --> 04:22.751
I think I'm gonna throw up.

04:22.753 --> 04:25.471
Morning sickness?
No.

04:27.608 --> 04:29.075
It's crazy, right?

04:29.077 --> 04:30.226
Are you shocked?

04:30.228 --> 04:32.478
No, I'm not shocked.
You're in love with Robin.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.779
Do you remember back

04:33.781 --> 04:35.931
at Christmas when she was upset,
you didn't even know why,

04:35.933 --> 04:38.401
<i>and you spent eight hours</i>
<i>setting up Christmas lights</i>

04:38.403 --> 04:40.269
<i>in the apartment</i>
<i>just to cheer her up.</i>

04:40.271 --> 04:42.438
That was a platonic friend thing.
A platonic friend thing?

04:42.440 --> 04:45.157
Really? Ted,
let me ask you a question.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.909
Would you have done that for me?

04:46.911 --> 04:49.745
You probably would have.
You're such a good friend, Ted.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.747
You, too, buddy.

04:51.749 --> 04:52.965
I'm going into the city.

04:54.084 --> 04:55.801
Just, while I'm gone,

04:55.803 --> 04:57.253
don't go snooping around
in our stuff.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.223
I know you think we have
a sex tape hidden somewhere,

05:00.225 --> 05:03.693
so I'll save you the trouble.
We don't. Good-bye.

05:03.695 --> 05:07.463
<i>Here's that moment</i>
<i>from Barney's perspective.</i>

05:09.300 --> 05:11.567
We have a sex tape hidden
somewhere.

05:15.405 --> 05:18.891
Challenge accepted.

05:18.893 --> 05:21.110
Robin again?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.412
Why does everyone
keep going after Robin?

05:23.414 --> 05:25.948
How come no one
ever takes a run at me?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.316
Barney hits on you every day.

05:27.318 --> 05:29.252
Yeah, but he just wants
to bang me.

05:29.254 --> 05:30.486
I want something real.

05:30.488 --> 05:32.455
I know, babe.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.423
Double A Cleaning.

05:34.425 --> 05:35.491
Consuela, it's Barney.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.826
I need you and the girls
for the afternoon.

05:37.828 --> 05:39.428
Of course, right away,
Mr. Barney.

05:39.430 --> 05:40.546
Are you at home now?

05:40.548 --> 05:42.181
No, I'm at a house
on Long Island.

05:42.183 --> 05:43.382
I'll text you the details.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.935
It's a big job.
The place has been ransacked.

05:45.937 --> 05:47.803
We'll get right on it.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.305
Thanks, Consuela,
you're the best.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.394
Ted, I know
you're ready to go

05:55.396 --> 05:57.179
with this whole
you-and-Robin thing,

05:57.181 --> 05:58.614
but is she ready
to go?

05:58.616 --> 06:01.701
Is she ready to go? Um...

06:05.238 --> 06:08.157
Mmm, we'll continue this...

06:08.159 --> 06:10.209
when I get back.

06:12.195 --> 06:14.630
So...

06:14.632 --> 06:16.532
Are you sure
that it wasn't...?

06:19.869 --> 06:22.672
We'll continue this
when I get back.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.307
Okay.

06:27.361 --> 06:29.261
What?! No!

06:29.263 --> 06:32.014
Damn it, Lily,
why are you rooting against me?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.349
I'm not rooting
against you.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.100
Yes, you are.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.217
No, I'm not.

06:35.219 --> 06:36.502
<i>Yes, she was.</i>

06:36.504 --> 06:38.554
You see, at that very moment...

06:43.660 --> 06:46.612
"Long-term bets"?

06:56.039 --> 06:57.456
Hmm.

07:11.555 --> 07:15.808
My God! They're placing bets
on our lives.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.028
And I'm sorry,
Ted cannot pull off bald.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.813
You know Ted.
I'm right about this.

07:23.934 --> 07:27.319
Ted, I'm your best friend.
Why would I root against you?

07:27.321 --> 07:31.490
Lily bets Marshall that Ted
and Robin won't end up together.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.609
<i>That's why.</i>

07:36.651 --> 07:38.518
<i>So, Lily was betting against</i>
<i>me and Robin.</i>

07:38.795 --> 07:39.811
<i>I just didn't know it.</i>

07:39.813 --> 07:42.097
Okay, you want to make
it work with Robin?

07:42.099 --> 07:44.232
You need to stay
on her radar.

07:44.234 --> 07:46.184
Call her right now.

07:46.186 --> 07:47.652
She's on the plane.
Her phone's off.

07:47.654 --> 07:49.404
Oh, my God!

07:49.406 --> 07:52.324
How adorable would it be
if when the plane lands,

07:52.326 --> 07:53.441
she turns on her phone

07:53.443 --> 07:56.361
and her mailbox is full
of messages from you?!

07:57.781 --> 08:00.425
Ted, don't leave
her any voice mails.

08:00.450 --> 08:01.000
Why not?

08:01.001 --> 08:03.484
Because...
Because you need to go to Russia.

08:03.486 --> 08:04.869
With love!

08:04.871 --> 08:06.121
Surprise her.

08:06.123 --> 08:08.123
Make the--
in no way creepy--

08:08.125 --> 08:12.994
grand romantic gesture
that we all know Robin loves.

08:12.996 --> 08:14.963
Oh!

08:14.965 --> 08:17.432
So I just walk up to her
in Red Square

08:17.434 --> 08:18.667
with a dozen roses?

08:19.501 --> 08:21.302
Or float down to her

08:21.304 --> 08:23.054
in my hot air balloon

08:23.056 --> 08:25.357
with ten dozen roses!

08:25.359 --> 08:28.509
Yes, that's perfect!

08:28.511 --> 08:29.728
Not like this, Lily.

08:29.730 --> 08:31.345
Not like this.

08:31.347 --> 08:34.682
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some sonnets to write.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.184
Stay put, Ted.
You're gonna want to hear this.

08:38.988 --> 08:40.789
Guys, what's this?

08:40.791 --> 08:42.857
<i>And Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>explained.</i>

08:42.859 --> 08:44.843
<i>It all started ten years</i>
<i>earlier.</i>

08:44.845 --> 08:46.678
<i>They had been looking</i>
<i>for a new hobby</i>

08:46.680 --> 08:48.413
<i>they could do as a couple.</i>

08:48.415 --> 08:51.032
I already missed
the beginner's lesson.

08:51.034 --> 08:52.634
Maybe I shouldn't even go.

08:53.836 --> 08:55.053
Ah, screw it.

08:55.055 --> 08:57.472
I've seen the Olympics.
I know what I'm doing.

08:57.474 --> 08:59.674
I'm going skiing, bitches!

09:12.389 --> 09:13.855
He's gonna break
his leg.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.323
He's not gonna
break his leg.

09:15.325 --> 09:16.908
20 bucks says he does.

09:20.529 --> 09:22.547
"Lily bets Marshall

09:22.549 --> 09:26.451
that Ted
will break his leg skiing."

09:30.873 --> 09:33.024
You would be amazed.

09:33.026 --> 09:36.027
People fall off ski lifts
all the time.

09:36.029 --> 09:38.746
Well, I gotta hit the head.

09:43.969 --> 09:48.022
Well, he didn't
break his leg.

09:48.024 --> 09:50.258
Yeah, I gotta say that, um,

09:50.260 --> 09:53.645
making money off this bet
just makes me feel...

09:53.647 --> 09:55.246
More alive than
you've felt in years?

09:55.248 --> 09:57.265
Yes!
New hobby!

09:58.935 --> 10:01.786
We need a cash box,
some glitter and some glue!

10:01.788 --> 10:04.322
You've been
betting on us?

10:04.324 --> 10:06.241
Like we're a
couple of hobos

10:06.243 --> 10:07.792
fighting over
a sandwich

10:07.794 --> 10:10.278
in some psycho preppy
kid's backyard?

10:10.280 --> 10:12.664
No, this is just
what happens in marriage.

10:12.666 --> 10:13.631
You get bored.

10:13.633 --> 10:15.333
You run out
of things to do.

10:15.335 --> 10:16.784
We were making models.

10:16.786 --> 10:18.503
You single people
are out there

10:18.505 --> 10:20.922
with the drinking
and the sleeping around...

10:20.924 --> 10:22.257
Model airplanes.

10:22.259 --> 10:24.458
The grinding
and the bumping

10:24.460 --> 10:26.294
and the hot sweaty bodies.

10:26.296 --> 10:28.629
...with little propellers
that spin.

10:28.631 --> 10:30.565
Oh, this one looks
interesting.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.633
Lily, I thought you said
you wanted to.

10:32.635 --> 10:33.852
It was your idea.

10:33.854 --> 10:37.238
I starved myself for a week
to get camera-ready.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.040
You had a bear claw
for breakfast.

10:39.042 --> 10:41.242
Yeah, <i>a</i> bear claw.

10:41.244 --> 10:43.477
I-I changed my mind.

10:43.479 --> 10:47.481
I-I just don't want Barney
to see us doing it.

10:47.483 --> 10:49.284
Barney is never gonna see this.

10:49.286 --> 10:51.485
Oh, come on. It's Barney.

10:51.487 --> 10:54.339
Eventually,
somehow he's gonna see it.

10:54.341 --> 10:55.523
Want to bet?

10:55.525 --> 11:00.378
So there really is a sex tape.

11:06.969 --> 11:10.438
Anyhoozles,
just... long-term bets,

11:10.440 --> 11:12.273
just a silly thing we do.

11:12.275 --> 11:13.507
What about you, Ted?

11:13.509 --> 11:15.676
Your hair's looking good.

11:15.678 --> 11:18.229
"Lily bets Marshall
that Ted and Robin

11:18.231 --> 11:19.781
won't end up together."

11:21.016 --> 11:22.951
Wow.

11:22.953 --> 11:25.570
So now it's
becoming clear why...

11:25.572 --> 11:28.122
you've been trying to sabotage
my future happiness.

11:28.124 --> 11:29.541
To win a bet.

11:29.543 --> 11:30.708
Come on, Ted.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.827
We made that bet
so long ago.

11:32.829 --> 11:36.748
And boy, it's been
a real nail-biter.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.217
Ted and Stella
got engaged.

11:39.219 --> 11:40.385
Pay up.

11:40.387 --> 11:41.870
Not yet.

11:41.872 --> 11:43.871
We are driving
to the wedding.

11:43.873 --> 11:45.206
Pay up.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.208
Not yet.

11:48.377 --> 11:51.012
We are at the wedding.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.046
Pay up.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.714
Not yet.

11:56.435 --> 11:58.836
Damn it.

11:58.838 --> 12:00.688
I can't believe you guys!

12:00.690 --> 12:01.940
I got left at the alter,

12:01.942 --> 12:03.775
and all you cared about
was some stupid bet?

12:03.777 --> 12:06.527
I never stopped rooting
for you, but I...

12:06.529 --> 12:08.529
Ted, I'm not rooting
against you.

12:08.531 --> 12:10.865
I just don't think Robin's
the girl you marry.

12:10.867 --> 12:13.534
That's why I made
the stupid bet to begin with.

12:13.536 --> 12:15.670
I mean, yes,
it's five years later,

12:15.672 --> 12:17.538
and you haven't settled down
with anyone else,

12:17.540 --> 12:20.525
but you haven't settled down
with Robin, either.

12:21.260 --> 12:22.877
There must be
a reason for that.

12:22.879 --> 12:24.762
What's standing
in the way?

12:32.221 --> 12:33.438
God...

12:33.440 --> 12:36.524
if you help me find
this sex tape,

12:36.526 --> 12:38.860
I am going to make
some changes in my life.

12:38.862 --> 12:41.362
I am going to stop
sleeping around,

12:41.364 --> 12:44.148
quit drinking so much,
no more shenanigans.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.818
I am going to devote
my entire life

12:46.820 --> 12:50.538
to doing good deeds,
and praising your name.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.773
Is this what you're
looking for, Mr. Barney?

12:54.410 --> 12:56.127
Never mind, bro. Found it.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.881
I found it!

12:59.883 --> 13:03.084
Sweet glory hallelujah,
I found it, Ted.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.453
You're the only idiot I know
who still owns a VCR,

13:05.455 --> 13:07.121
so you are
the lucky winner of the

13:07.123 --> 13:09.623
"Who gets to sit next to me
and watch our best friends

13:09.625 --> 13:11.726
go bananas all over each other""
sweepstakes.

13:11.728 --> 13:14.812
To the outdated
viewing device!

13:14.814 --> 13:16.764
<i>And then I realized</i>
<i>why Robin and I</i>

13:16.766 --> 13:19.233
<i>hadn't gotten back together</i>
<i>in the last five years.</i>

13:19.235 --> 13:21.486
Oh, my God.

13:21.488 --> 13:23.338
Robin's in love with you.

13:29.321 --> 13:31.810
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.510
Robin is in love with you.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.946
No, she's not.
Trust me.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.414
Yes, she is.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.599
Something happened
between you guys.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.251
That's why
you broke up with Nora.

13:41.253 --> 13:44.104
That night,
I saw you in her room,

13:44.106 --> 13:46.723
there were rose petals,
candles...

13:46.725 --> 13:48.525
You saw that?

13:48.527 --> 13:50.644
Well, then, maybe you also saw

13:50.646 --> 13:53.647
those rose petals and candles
going into a garbage bag.

13:53.649 --> 13:55.866
<i>And then Barney</i>
<i>told me everything.</i>

13:55.868 --> 13:58.485
<i>How he and Robin hooked up.</i>

13:58.487 --> 14:01.571
<i>How he broke up with Nora</i>
<i>to be with her.</i>

14:01.573 --> 14:04.658
<i>How he thought she would do</i>
<i>the same for him.</i>

14:04.660 --> 14:07.411
<i>How she broke his heart.</i>

14:10.998 --> 14:12.966
She chose Kevin.

14:12.968 --> 14:15.469
It hurt, but...

14:15.471 --> 14:17.087
I guess they're in love.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.522
They broke up last night.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.674
Bummer.

14:20.676 --> 14:23.977
Anyway, let's make our own bets
about this sex tape.

14:23.979 --> 14:26.430
I've got Marshall
with a surprise piercing

14:26.432 --> 14:27.898
at five-to-one odds,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.567
Lily with a landing strip,
ten-to-one,

14:30.569 --> 14:32.436
Marshall with a landing strip,
even money.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.938
I don't believe this.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.440
You were in love with Robin,

14:36.442 --> 14:38.658
you find out she's single,
and your reaction is "Bummer"?

14:38.660 --> 14:39.776
What do you want me to say, Ted?

14:39.778 --> 14:42.446
Whatever I
thought was there,

14:42.448 --> 14:45.232
she thought differently.

14:45.234 --> 14:48.118
So... no, I don't care
that Robin is single again.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.005
So if Robin started dating
someone else, you wouldn't mind?

14:52.007 --> 14:53.090
Nope.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.759
Even if that somebody else
was me?

14:56.561 --> 14:59.846
Even if that somebody else
was you.

14:59.848 --> 15:01.698
Really?
Really.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.867
Hey, bros before hos, right?

15:04.769 --> 15:06.503
No matter how mad she made me,

15:06.505 --> 15:09.122
Robin's still my bro.

15:09.124 --> 15:11.041
And if, uh, you make her happy,

15:11.043 --> 15:13.676
then that makes me happy.

15:13.678 --> 15:17.230
Barney, you've really grown up,
you know that?

15:17.232 --> 15:18.698
Thanks.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.284
Now let's watch our two best
friends have sex on tape.

15:21.286 --> 15:22.869
I'll make the popcorn.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.205
Don't watch that tape!

15:25.207 --> 15:27.124
Watch that tape!

15:27.126 --> 15:28.691
Well, sorry, I just really
want to win the bet.

15:28.693 --> 15:30.360
And here we go.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.796
O-okay. Okay, fine, Barney.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.965
Watch our dirty little home
movie, but be forewarned,

15:34.967 --> 15:37.300
at about the one minute mark,

15:37.302 --> 15:39.169
you're going to see me
make this face.

15:41.222 --> 15:43.140
Oh, God,
that's the face you made

15:43.142 --> 15:44.474
the day we rode motorcycles.
Yeah.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.926
Yeah. You really
want to see that?

15:45.928 --> 15:48.645
A-and do you want
to hear me go, uh...

15:52.484 --> 15:55.218
It can't sound like that.
It can't.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.987
I know that noise, I've heard it
through the walls.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.572
I thought the neighbors
had a sick cat.

15:58.574 --> 15:59.739
Okay, but, Barney,
just remember,

15:59.741 --> 16:01.691
you'll also be seeing
a lot of this:

16:01.693 --> 16:04.027
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.745
It's this, but
I'm not pregnant.

16:05.747 --> 16:09.082
My skin is loose,
like an elephant.

16:09.084 --> 16:11.368
My boobs are
perky and plump.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.453
I slobber
like a confused old dog.

16:13.455 --> 16:15.789
I slap my own ass.
I slap my own ass!

16:20.344 --> 16:22.745
Barney...

16:22.747 --> 16:24.014
that was <i>my</i> VCR.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.132
Ted...

16:26.134 --> 16:28.351
it was a VCR.

16:32.023 --> 16:34.024
A week later, I picked Robin up
<i>at the airport.</i>

16:35.026 --> 16:37.277
♪

16:40.531 --> 16:43.316
♪

16:43.318 --> 16:46.236
<i>And took her out to dinner</i>
<i>at her favorite restaurant.</i>

16:48.105 --> 16:51.274
<i>And by the end of the night,</i>
<i>one thing had become clear:</i>

16:51.276 --> 16:53.627
It's not going to happen, is it?

16:55.163 --> 16:56.379
I'm sorry.

16:58.966 --> 17:00.467
It's because of Barney.

17:00.469 --> 17:01.935
What?

17:01.937 --> 17:03.470
No.

17:03.472 --> 17:04.921
Barney and I... we...

17:04.923 --> 17:08.058
No. No. It's just...

17:08.060 --> 17:11.411
You know, things have
just been so crazy lately.

17:12.296 --> 17:15.965
Everything in my life
is... unstable.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.152
I mean, you're one of the few
things that I can count on.

17:20.238 --> 17:23.806
And... I really don't
want to mess that up.

17:24.808 --> 17:28.028
We-we... we still have our deal,
right?

17:28.030 --> 17:31.648
If we're both still...
single when we're 40?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.816
Yeah. Yeah.

17:36.454 --> 17:38.622
No. Look... I'm sorry.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.624
I-I can't do that anymore.

17:41.626 --> 17:43.343
As long as the door
is even a little bit open,

17:43.345 --> 17:45.629
I have this feeling
that I'll just be...

17:45.631 --> 17:49.266
waiting around to see if I win
the lottery when you turn 40.

17:50.434 --> 17:53.053
I think you know
how you feel about me now,

17:53.055 --> 17:56.957
and... I don't think time's
going to change that.

17:58.008 --> 18:00.843
Just tell me.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.612
Do you love me?

18:08.452 --> 18:10.637
No.

18:18.246 --> 18:19.963
I'm sorry.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.831
We're great as friends.

18:21.833 --> 18:22.999
Let's just...

18:23.001 --> 18:24.701
Let's just forget
I ever said anything.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.643
Bar. Alone. Now.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.095
It's just a bump
in the road.

18:35.097 --> 18:36.730
You guys are meant
to be together.

18:36.732 --> 18:38.098
You can't give up.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.382
You... i-it can still happen.

18:39.384 --> 18:40.483
No. Marshall...

18:40.485 --> 18:42.102
What about
the hot air balloon thing,

18:42.104 --> 18:43.853
with the ten dozen roses?

18:43.855 --> 18:45.655
And how's the sonnet coming, buddy?
Dude.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.074
You bet on the wrong horse.
Let it go.

18:48.859 --> 18:50.560
Believe it or not,

18:50.562 --> 18:52.278
I'm happy about this. I'm...

18:52.280 --> 18:54.331
I can finally move on.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.833
This is a good thing.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.002
Really.

19:04.258 --> 19:05.408
Hey, Robin.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.876
Oh, hey.
Hey.

19:06.878 --> 19:09.078
Hey. Uh, look, before I forget,
here's Lily's hairdryer.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.598
I borrowed it, like,
a million years ago.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.099
Yeah, you can keep that.

19:13.101 --> 19:14.434
Um... Hey, listen,

19:14.436 --> 19:16.085
Ted told me what happened
with you guys,

19:16.087 --> 19:17.854
and he says that
he's at peace with it.

Oh, really?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.141
That's good.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.926
He's lying, Robin.

19:23.928 --> 19:27.313
He's trying to be strong,
but it's killing him,

19:27.315 --> 19:30.233
and so, as his best friend,

19:30.235 --> 19:32.202
I have to say something that...

19:32.204 --> 19:34.537
he loves you
just way too much to say.

19:35.773 --> 19:38.224
