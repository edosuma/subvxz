Season07 Episode12

00:14.990 --> 00:16.690
Jack.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.200
Put down your weapon. Now!

00:19.210 --> 00:20.650
What the hell's going on?

00:20.690 --> 00:22.080
–Where's Ryan Burnett?
–What?

00:22.120 --> 00:24.170
Senator Mayer's chief
of staff— where is he?

00:24.210 --> 00:28.070
Tony double-backed to one of his contacts
who gave him information of a second attack.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.700
It's gonna take place here
in Washington within the hour.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.210
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.020
Burnett's been
supporting them all along.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.630
He knows where the
attack's gonna take place,

00:35.670 --> 00:39.290
so you can either tell me where
he is, or I will find him myself.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.880
Mr Burnett, you are a
traitor and a terrorist.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.970
I am not. I love my country.

00:45.670 --> 00:50.320
–Mr Bauer, this is president Taylor.
–Where's the target?

00:50.330 --> 00:53.690
What you're doing is
against the law, Mr Bauer.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.360
I am ordering you to stand down.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.380
Where's…

00:58.390 --> 01:00.760
Take Mr Bauer away. He's under arrest.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.750
You should have come to me. You
should have presented your case.

01:03.790 --> 01:07.090
And would it really have
made a difference, ma'am?

01:08.150 --> 01:10.690
colonel Dubaku is dead.

01:10.730 --> 01:15.218
Laurent must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.

01:15.230 --> 01:16.860
There is no sign of my father.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.260
Let me take his place
on the assault team.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.220
Spoken like a true Dubaku.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.920
Laurent, it is time for us to go.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.570
This is it, Larry, no question.

01:26.610 --> 01:27.864
They're moving out.

01:27.890 --> 01:30.464
–Any idea what the next target is?
–No.

01:33.550 --> 01:38.490
From our location, it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

02:43.720 --> 02:45.730
Let's move.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.220
That's it. I need to see her right now.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.900
Ms Taylor, the president will
see you as soon as she's able.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.870
Well, you tell her her
daughter is done waiting.

02:54.910 --> 02:56.880
I'm going to the hospital
to be with my father.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.400
I think it would be a good idea to
talk to your mother before you do that.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.110
The president's orders are that
you remain in the white house.

03:06.120 --> 03:10.030
So if I try to leave, you will
actually physically restrain me?

03:10.070 --> 03:11.950
Oh, that would never happen, Ms Taylor,

03:11.990 --> 03:14.940
because I know you have too
much respect for your mother

03:14.980 --> 03:18.082
and her office to ever
let things get that far.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.270
Well done, agent.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.980
You've been at this a while.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.730
Five administrations, ma'am.

03:38.260 --> 03:43.000
Olivia, your mother asked me to
fill you in on what's happening.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.020
Well, with all due respect, Ethan, you're
the last person she should be sending.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.800
There's about to be another
terrorist attack on this city.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.860
That's why she wants you to remain here.

03:52.870 --> 03:55.080
Are we talking about
more planes going down?

03:55.120 --> 03:59.290
We don't know. But whatever's
going to happen will happen soon.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.950
I'm heading to the Pentagon.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.880
On top of all of this, there's
also the invasion to deal with.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.910
So, bear in mind, your mother's
under tremendous pressure right now.

04:14.050 --> 04:17.570
It's only a matter of time before the media
picks up on the heightened security measures.

04:17.610 --> 04:19.950
I want to issue a statement
before that happens.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.040
Play down the actual
likelihood of an attack,

04:22.079 --> 04:24.600
talk about the security measures as
being due diligence, rather than…

04:24.640 --> 04:26.940
No, Meredith. The public
deserves the truth.

04:26.980 --> 04:32.310
We stress caution and calm, but we acknowledge
we have intel about another terrorist action.

04:32.350 --> 04:37.168
Yes, ma'am. Angela and I will have
something for you as soon as possible.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.010
Madam president, Larry
Moss is calling in.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.860
He says he's got a lead on the attack.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.850
Put him through.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.520
Agent Moss, you're
on with the president.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.040
Madam president, we've discovered what we believe
was a staging area being used by terrorists

04:51.080 --> 04:54.480
on the south Shore of the Potomac,
near the ITP rail and shipyards.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.810
Madam president, we've identified
one of the men as general Juma.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.530
What? Juma's in DC?

05:01.540 --> 05:05.480
Yes, ma'am, and we know that there are at
least a dozen other men involved in the attack,

05:05.520 --> 05:07.320
and they are armed for a small war.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.410
Have you found evidence that
tells us where the target might be?

05:10.450 --> 05:13.160
No, ma'am, but we have search
teams out looking for the men,

05:13.200 --> 05:16.590
and we're hoping that agent
walker has more information.

05:16.630 --> 05:20.580
She's the one who ID'd Juma, but,
uh, we've lost contact with her.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.890
Lost contact?

05:21.930 --> 05:24.300
Yes, madam president, but
we have every reason to hope

05:24.340 --> 05:28.100
that she's still alive and
in pursuit of the terrorists.

05:28.610 --> 05:31.830
If she's out there,
ma'am, we'll find her.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.390
Hold it right there!

05:50.400 --> 05:53.030
I'm agent Renee walker, FBI.

05:53.090 --> 05:54.760
Agent walker, we just
got an alert on you.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.230
You need to call Larry
Moss at FBI right now.

05:56.270 --> 05:58.070
Tell him there's gonna be a
terrorist attack on the white house.

05:58.110 --> 06:00.160
Yes, ma'am. I'll call it in right away.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.560
This is Thompson…

06:13.610 --> 06:18.120
Ranger Thompson, please respond and
report your location. Ranger Thompson…

06:18.160 --> 06:23.044
Ranger Thompson, please respond and
report your location. Ranger Thompson…

06:27.430 --> 06:29.440
Bill.

06:29.470 --> 06:33.230
The attorney general wants you transferred to
his custody so he can file criminal charges.

06:33.270 --> 06:35.330
Have we learned anything
else about the attack?

06:35.370 --> 06:38.860
I reached Tony. He couldn't get
any more information from his guy.

06:38.900 --> 06:44.140
According to the FBI, Renee walker followed
a lead on her own to an abandoned
warehouse on the Potomac.

06:44.180 --> 06:47.930
Got a visual on a heavily-armed
commando unit led by Juma himself.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.570
But she went missing right
after she called it in.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.590
–What do you mean, missing?
–We're not sure.

06:51.630 --> 06:53.950
The FBI's searching the area,
but there's no sign of her,

06:53.990 --> 06:56.020
or any evidence telling us
what the target might be.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.770
Burnett knows.

06:57.820 --> 06:58.970
The president offered
him an immunity deal.

06:59.010 --> 07:00.420
He turned it down,
hasn't said a word since.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.770
Damn it, Bill, he was
talking when they stopped me.

07:02.810 --> 07:05.820
Put me in a room with him for five minutes,
and we can stop this thing from happening.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.770
Jack, even if I was willing to release you,
he's being transported to Kennedy memorial.

07:09.810 --> 07:10.830
You couldn't get access to him.

07:10.870 --> 07:13.460
Fine. Then you do it.
You can get access.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.610
I'm not trained in coercive techniques.

07:15.650 --> 07:19.370
This is not a maybe. Ryan Burnett is
an accessory to a terrorist attack.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.080
If you don't do this, people will die.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.430
Look, I'm not arguing about what
needs to be done. But I can't do it.

07:23.470 --> 07:24.560
I don't do that. It's not me.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.900
–That's not good enough.
–Jack!

07:25.940 --> 07:27.710
Damn it, Bill. That's not good enough.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.780
You were the one who told
me, people who stand by—

07:29.820 --> 07:32.790
they might as well help
them plant the bomb.

07:34.410 --> 07:38.530
You can do this. Bill,
you have to do this.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.280
I can't, Jack. I'm sorry.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.080
Bill?

07:54.690 --> 07:56.820
I can't.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.510
This is it, general.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.150
we're on the other side of the conduit.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.330
Are you in position?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.020
Yes, general. I'll be ready for you.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.289
What was that?

08:42.630 --> 08:44.450
I thought I heard you say something.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.740
–Just, uh, talking to myself.
–yeah.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.220
Hey, I tell you we're having
people over on Saturday?

08:50.260 --> 08:52.430
Nothing fancy. We're
bringing in chinese.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.176
You think you're gonna
make it this time?

08:56.400 --> 09:00.850
Chinese. But I was looking
forward to Sheila's cooking.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.560
all clear, general.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.860
Excellent.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.490
we'll have access in ten seconds.

09:45.520 --> 09:50.090
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes
until the proximity alarms come back up.

09:50.130 --> 09:56.060
Five, four, three, two, one…

09:57.260 --> 09:59.430
move!

10:38.130 --> 10:41.232
I've accessed the secret
service tracking grid.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.340
Where is she?

10:45.370 --> 10:48.160
Right here in the oval office.

10:49.490 --> 10:51.640
Let's go.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.540
clear.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.800
We will meet resistance,
which we must counter quickly.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.980
Silently.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.910
We have nine minutes until the
next secret service roll call.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.970
We must find the president by then.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.990
The president is preparing to issue
a statement that will clarify that.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.030
Yeah, I'll let you know, soon
as it's ready for release.

12:13.070 --> 12:16.600
Let go of the phone.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.420
five minutes until roll call, general.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.940
Juma had your father killed.

12:57.230 --> 12:58.020
What?

12:58.070 --> 13:00.560
Listen to me, I know that
Dubaku is your father.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.870
Juma's been lying to
you. Your father is dead.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.360
My father is alive!

13:04.390 --> 13:06.810
Juma had to make sure that
your father didn't talk.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.840
So he sent a man named
Udo to murder him.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.650
No. No, I… I don't believe you.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.630
Look, I was there when Udo
did it. That's how I found you.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.960
By following him back to the rail car.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.680
General Juma betrayed you.

13:20.690 --> 13:24.300
You are lying. You are lying!

13:54.690 --> 13:56.540
Renee!

13:56.950 --> 13:59.480
I know the target.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.480
Reissued warrants and
order for transport, sir.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.950
Sorry, Jack.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.230
this way, Mr Bauer.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.940
–Bill Buchanan.
–It's Larry Moss.

14:18.980 --> 14:21.710
Renee walker says the
target is the white house.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.420
–How good is her intel?
–Firsthand.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.090
She says they're getting
in via subterranean access.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.850
I'll initiate a
lockdown. You alert CIRG.

14:29.880 --> 14:30.950
This is Bill Buchanan.

14:30.990 --> 14:33.910
I have confirmation the white house
is a target of a terrorist attack.

14:33.950 --> 14:36.780
Condition red. Repeat: condition
red. Secure the president.

14:36.820 --> 14:39.320
Get to your posts.

14:39.330 --> 14:42.250
Jack, I could use your help.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.290
I need to know you'll
do exactly as I say.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.870
You have my word.

14:47.570 --> 14:50.550
–Where's the president now?
–Oval office.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.410
What's the meaning of this?

14:54.450 --> 14:56.580
–You need to come with us.
–The white house is under attack. What?

14:56.620 --> 14:59.120
Madam president, we need to go.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.050
Ma'am, we need to go
right now. Ms Taylor.

15:04.060 --> 15:08.180
I've got the president's daughter.
We're on our way to the lockdown.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.840
Men are down. There's no safe path out.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.240
We need to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.100
Bill, we're clear.

15:13.140 --> 15:14.570
What the hell is he doing here?

15:14.610 --> 15:15.290
He's with me.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.690
Madam president, right now, you
need all the help you can get.

15:17.730 --> 15:19.420
How is this happening?
Where's my daughter?

15:19.460 --> 15:22.930
Aaron pierce is taking her to lockdown
as we speak, but we need to move.

15:22.970 --> 15:26.330
Agents in zones five, seven
and nine, please respond.

15:26.370 --> 15:29.250
Five, seven and nine, respond.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.930
I can't reach anyone in the quadrant.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.200
Juma's men are headed straight for us.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.510
They know where she is.
They're tracking her, Bill.

15:36.550 --> 15:39.330
Madam president, let
me see your tracker.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.350
Bill, what's the most direct route
to the lockdown? From the east.

15:42.390 --> 15:46.944
I'll head west with the tracker and
draw them away. You go with Jack.

15:47.590 --> 15:49.150
Agent Bauer.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.850
This is your house. I'll follow.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.510
We're moving the president to lockdown.

15:56.550 --> 15:59.650
Agent Hovis, we've got agents
down in multiple quadrants.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.110
We need reinforcements, sir.

16:01.150 --> 16:04.318
Copy that. We're on our
way to the lockdown now.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.570
Let's go.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.370
General. The president
has left the oval office.

16:15.410 --> 16:18.220
She's heading down the west corridor.

16:18.230 --> 16:22.270
Udo, take your team that way.
We'll trap her in between us.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.100
We're getting close
to the president, sir.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.060
Up ahead, around this corner.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.720
The president's tracker, sir.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.790
they know we're here.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.849
They're moving the
president to the lockdown.

17:13.890 --> 17:15.670
Find her.

17:24.890 --> 17:30.730
Take him. We need hostages. Start
gathering 'em up. Let's move.

17:46.980 --> 17:49.370
We've engaged hostiles on
the way to the lockdown.

17:49.410 --> 17:54.096
We do not have a visual on the
president. We're still two minutes away.

17:55.370 --> 18:01.650
get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Move
it! Come on! Come on, move it! Come on!

18:03.090 --> 18:05.780
Aaron, it's Jack. I'm with the president,
approaching lockdown. Where are you?

18:05.820 --> 18:08.700
We're still upstairs, Jack.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.790
Move! Move!

18:11.800 --> 18:13.950
hostiles are in control of the area.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.920
Looking for a way past
them to the lockdown.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.100
Copy that. Juma's men are
closing on our position.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.130
You're going to have about 30 seconds to
get here before I have to seal this door.

18:21.170 --> 18:22.300
Understood.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.740
You will not close this door
until my daughter gets here.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.140
Madam president, right now, your life is
the priority, whether you like it or not.

18:27.180 --> 18:30.370
Please, step inside.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.650
madam president, are you all right?

18:47.940 --> 18:52.130
Aaron, it's Jack. We're
sealed off in the lockdown.
We came under attack. We didn't have a choice.

18:52.170 --> 18:55.510
We couldn't have made it anyway, Jack.
We'll try to find a way out of the building.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.860
–Copy that, Aaron…
–Jack.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.970
Jack, do you read me?

19:02.970 --> 19:05.910
Aaron, it's Jack. Do you copy? Damn it.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.100
Juma's cut off our communication.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.780
I need to know that my daughter's safe.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.710
Madam president, I
can't answer that yet.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.280
Abo.

19:46.050 --> 19:49.050
General Juma, they
brought in reinforcements.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.330
I don't know how much longer we can
hold them off from your position.

19:52.370 --> 19:54.640
Stand by.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.860
Ngozi?

19:59.020 --> 20:03.838
Agents are moving in from all directions;
we will be heavily outnumbered.

20:04.550 --> 20:07.860
Does secret service know the
president is secured in the lockdown?

20:07.900 --> 20:09.510
The only ones who saw are dead.

20:09.550 --> 20:12.960
Put me on to their
communications channel.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.320
Go ahead, sir.

20:15.350 --> 20:18.480
This is general Juma.
I have the president.

20:18.490 --> 20:22.040
Evacuate immediately, or she will die.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.130
I need proof you have the president
before I can give that order.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.190
–Let us speak to her.
–Who is this?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.790
Special agent Hovis.

20:31.820 --> 20:36.190
Agent Hovis, move your men out of the
building and beyond the fence line,

20:36.230 --> 20:38.540
or I will kill the president.

20:38.580 --> 20:41.530
And her death will be on your head.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.680
Agent Hovis?

20:45.710 --> 20:46.920
We're pulling back.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.620
All agents, fall back immediately!

20:50.220 --> 20:53.530
I repeat: All agents fall back.

21:04.140 --> 21:07.270
General, secret service is retreating.

21:11.190 --> 21:13.160
They are retreating, general.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.390
–All of them?
–Yes, sir.

21:17.170 --> 21:20.550
Gather all the hostages
and bring them here.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.780
–Lock down the exits. Move.
–Sir.

21:36.850 --> 21:40.240
Confirming secret service
retreat in western quadrant.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.660
Copy, general.

21:43.690 --> 21:47.810
The only reason secret service would retreat
is if they thought Juma had the president.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.790
But that man, Bauer, said he
got my mother into the lockdown.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.750
Juma's bluffing them.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.370
We need to get out of here and let our
people know that as soon as possible

21:55.410 --> 21:56.590
so they can retake the building.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.840
Get out of here? How?
They're everywhere.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.320
Move it!

22:03.330 --> 22:07.580
Keep your hands on your
head— move it! Go! Move it!

22:13.710 --> 22:16.540
Move it! Move!

22:20.010 --> 22:24.950
Move it! Come on, move! Move it! Move
your feet. Get out here. Move it. Move it.

22:24.990 --> 22:28.380
Right here. Keep
going. Come on. Move it!

22:34.320 --> 22:37.290
Turn around. Turn around.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.470
Can you open it?

22:50.480 --> 22:54.590
Yes. Assuming the specifications
hodges gave us are correct.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.180
–How long?
–15 minutes.

23:27.650 --> 23:30.950
We confronted them in one
of the first floor corridors.

23:30.990 --> 23:36.190
At that point, Juma ordered us to retreat,
threatening to kill the president
if we didn't comply.

23:36.230 --> 23:39.210
But he never gave a visual
confirmation he was holding the president?

23:39.250 --> 23:42.200
No, he didn't, but I felt, at that
point, I had no choice but to pull back.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.970
His men were killing
civilians and agents.

23:44.010 --> 23:45.830
Any idea how many people
are still trapped inside?

23:45.870 --> 23:48.390
Cross-checking the evacuees
with the white house manifest.

23:48.430 --> 23:51.130
So far, it looks like 53.

23:51.150 --> 23:52.170
Any secret service?

23:52.210 --> 23:56.302
As far as I know, we have no
agents left in there still alive.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.110
They'll be prepared to storm the
building as soon as the order is given.

24:01.150 --> 24:05.320
Yeah, well, at this point, that order
has to be given by the vice president.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.310
What's his status?

24:06.350 --> 24:09.120
Secret service has him en
route to a secure location.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.400
All right, let me know as
soon as he's locked down.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.770
And Hovis, I need an infrared
sat-an of the building.

24:14.810 --> 24:17.360
–Highest resolution possible.
–Got it.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.230
You didn't tell me that
Jack was in the white house.

24:26.270 --> 24:29.350
He was under arrest. Being he under
guard when the attack took place.

24:29.390 --> 24:31.920
Under arrest for what?

24:32.510 --> 24:37.724
He found out an aide to senator Mayer
named Burnett was part of the conspiracy.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.720
He was caught torturing
him… in the white house.

24:42.580 --> 24:45.540
Almost killed the man
before he was stopped.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.840
Renee, the president is our
priority, not Jack Bauer.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.880
–Are we clear on that?
–Clear.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.080
–Are you sure?
–Yes.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.860
They're bringing in more hostages.

25:08.010 --> 25:13.530
Get down! Now! Get in
here! Sit! No talking.

25:15.730 --> 25:17.780
I don't see Olivia.

25:17.830 --> 25:19.860
Madam president, that's good news.

25:19.900 --> 25:24.490
I know Aaron pierce. He will do everything in
his power to make sure that
your daughter is safe.

25:24.530 --> 25:26.610
This is the white house, for God's sake.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.360
How is it possible that they were able
to get around our security protocols?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.190
There's only one explanation.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.990
They had help on the inside.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.610
From whom?

25:40.290 --> 25:42.890
Oh, this is insane.

25:42.900 --> 25:46.220
Juma must realize that there's no
way for him to get out of this alive.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.650
I'm afraid he does. This is his endgame.

25:48.690 --> 25:51.450
He came here to make a statement,
and he's willing to die for it.

25:51.490 --> 25:54.390
As soon as the rescue teams realize
that you're secure, they'll move in.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.860
It's only a matter of time.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.720
What's he doing? Is that
some kind of explosive?

25:59.760 --> 26:02.310
–No.
–Mr Bauer?

26:02.320 --> 26:06.400
Oh, my God. They've
got the access codes.

26:06.410 --> 26:08.130
I need to get into that panel.

26:08.170 --> 26:09.420
Is there something I can do?

26:09.460 --> 26:13.354
Yeah, give me that toolbox
over there. Put it on the table.

26:30.970 --> 26:32.870
Damn it.

26:38.060 --> 26:42.010
Madam president, plug the cord
into the wall, please. Now.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.990
Okay.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.500
General.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.260
–What's wrong?
–It just went dead.

27:07.270 --> 27:10.500
Somehow, they must have disabled
the circuitry from inside.

27:10.540 --> 27:13.890
Then, we'll use C4
to blow open the door.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.960
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of
the 11 locking rods. It will take too long.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.158
Depending on how the steel is
hardened, C4 might not even work.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.140
Then we'll find another way.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.950
There can be no room for doubt.

27:42.990 --> 27:45.310
We have the president trapped.

27:45.360 --> 27:49.220
We open up that door, we
become a part of history.

27:49.990 --> 27:52.700
We will find another way.

28:14.170 --> 28:17.970
Yes. Just a moment.

28:21.060 --> 28:23.220
Call came in on the dedicated uplink.

28:23.260 --> 28:26.140
–I heard it.
–It's him, sir.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.930
Put him on speaker.

28:37.070 --> 28:39.750
General, didn't expect to
be hearing from you directly.

28:39.790 --> 28:41.150
What is it I can do for you?

28:41.190 --> 28:42.970
We have a problem.

28:43.010 --> 28:45.760
The president is
secured in the lockdown.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.540
Well, we prepared you
for that possibility.

28:47.580 --> 28:50.220
We gave you the specs
for the locking mechanism.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.170
They shorted the lock out from the inside.

28:53.220 --> 28:55.710
I need you to find me another way in.

28:55.750 --> 28:58.030
General, I've given you
everything I have to give.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.430
My part in this thing is over.

29:07.780 --> 29:11.060
Are you forgetting that you
don't have the shipment yet?

29:11.100 --> 29:15.130
Now, general, I expect you to be
an honorable man. We made a deal.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.990
We held up our end of the bargain.
We got you in the white house.

29:18.030 --> 29:19.800
I expect you to hold up yours.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.350
I don't care about your expectations.

29:22.400 --> 29:27.350
You help me, or I will destroy that
shipment before it ever arrives to you.

29:28.570 --> 29:30.620
Hang on.

29:31.140 --> 29:34.890
Well… Seaton, what do you think?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.450
Can he do what he says?

29:36.490 --> 29:39.080
The shipment's not due in the
port for another two hours.

29:39.120 --> 29:43.476
His men will have plenty of time
to destroy it, render it useless.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.980
General? Tell me— who else is in
the lockdown with the president?

29:55.990 --> 29:59.440
My men saw her enter with another man.

29:59.450 --> 30:04.004
Well, I'm looking at the white house
manifest, and according to this,

30:04.010 --> 30:08.300
Olivia Taylor is presently
in the building with you.

30:08.690 --> 30:12.190
The president's daughter? Are you sure?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.480
Their system logs everyone
in and out electronically.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.420
If it says that she's
in there, she's in there.

30:16.460 --> 30:21.476
Now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll
get the president to open that door.

30:21.650 --> 30:24.900
Your shipment will arrive as planned.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.350
Thank you.

30:30.650 --> 30:33.550
There, you see—
stress. Stress…

30:33.900 --> 30:37.050
is the fertilizer of creativity.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.920
Let's play some darts.

30:40.930 --> 30:43.820
The president's daughter is
somewhere in the white house.

30:43.860 --> 30:46.580
Let's find her.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.280
Raise your heads. Show me your faces.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.190
What do you think's going on?

31:15.980 --> 31:19.420
I asked you a question, Mr Buchanan.

31:21.790 --> 31:24.450
You think I made the
wrong call with Bauer.

31:24.490 --> 31:31.090
You think that if I'd signed off on him torturing
Ryan Burnett, all of this
could have been avoided?

31:33.060 --> 31:36.220
You don't know what
I'm thinking, senator.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.900
She's not here.

31:46.260 --> 31:49.240
Go ahead and find her
and bring her to me.

32:13.130 --> 32:15.260
–What happened? What did you see?
–The door's guarded.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.000
Well, there's got to be another way out.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.680
There are only three exits to
this wing, and they're all covered.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.110
The windows are sealed
and hardened. Unbreakable.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.810
We have to let them know the terrorists are
bluffing; that they don't have my mother.

32:24.850 --> 32:27.630
Our only option is to get a signal out.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.210
We can do it from the
windows of the residence.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.372
Okay, okay, good.

32:30.420 --> 32:33.210
You'll be safer if I
leave you in a secure area.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.010
I'll get the signal out
and come back for you.

32:35.050 --> 32:37.620
I'm not gonna sit and hide in
some damn vent, agent pierce.

32:37.660 --> 32:43.000
Ma'am, it is a long way, and we're probably gonna
encounter more of Juma's men. It's too dangerous.

32:43.040 --> 32:48.350
I don't care. I'm going with you, and
don't try to argue. I don't have the time.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.610
Okay. Stay behind me.

33:06.910 --> 33:09.840
Agent Moss, sat-scan's all set up here.

33:10.350 --> 33:14.470
We can see the cluster of hostages,
but not the individual bodies.

33:14.510 --> 33:16.280
That the best they can do? They
can't boost the resolution on this?

33:16.320 --> 33:21.020
No, sir. The white house is one of the most
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.320
Yeah, got it.

33:22.350 --> 33:24.680
The vice president's ready.
They're initiating communication.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.090
–Thanks.
–Yeah.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.910
Give us the room.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.430
You're on with the vice president.

33:42.470 --> 33:46.100
Mr Vice president, I'm special agent
Moss, head of the FBI's DC branch.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.210
This is agent walker.

33:48.230 --> 33:50.330
I've been briefed on
the general situation.

33:50.370 --> 33:51.950
What are the latest facts on the ground?

33:51.990 --> 33:53.490
There's nothing further
from general Juma,

33:53.530 --> 33:58.400
but an infrared scan of the
building shows he's holding
the hostages in a hallway
outside the Roosevelt room.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.920
Now this is very possibly
good news for the president.

34:01.960 --> 34:02.920
Explain.

34:02.970 --> 34:05.650
The area's not one of the more
defensible places in the building.

34:05.690 --> 34:08.900
Tactically, it makes no sense for
Juma to have chosen it as a base.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.940
However, the area is adjacent
to the ground floor lockdown,

34:11.980 --> 34:14.889
which we know the
president was en route to.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.630
So, you think the president
made it into the lockdown?

34:17.670 --> 34:19.780
That's our best explanation
for him being there.

34:19.820 --> 34:22.139
We're therefore are asking you
to authorize the rescue operation

34:22.179 --> 34:25.310
before Juma manages to
penetrate the lockdown.

34:29.300 --> 34:35.570
Do you have any other evidence that supports
your theory that the president
is in the lockdown?

34:36.400 --> 34:40.650
There's the fact that he couldn't produce the
president when we asked him
to prove that he had her.

34:40.690 --> 34:41.840
Couldn't or wouldn't?

34:41.880 --> 34:43.500
You can't be certain
which one it is, can you?

34:43.540 --> 34:45.260
Certainty's not possible
in this case, sir.

34:45.300 --> 34:50.250
We're giving you our best estimation
and we urge you to allow us to launch.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.350
What if you're wrong? What if
Juma does have the president?

34:53.389 --> 34:56.199
He will kill her as soon as
he realizes what you're doing.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.580
Inaction has its own risks, too, sir.

34:58.620 --> 35:01.000
The more time Juma has
to reinforce his position,

35:01.040 --> 35:04.560
the more difficult it'll be to
take the building and to save lives.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.090
I understand.

35:06.130 --> 35:08.310
But my priority must
be the president's life.

35:08.350 --> 35:12.000
Prudence dictates that I hold off
on authorizing the rescue operation

35:12.040 --> 35:14.390
until we can be more
certain of her status.

35:14.430 --> 35:18.090
Mr Vice president, terrorists
are in control of the white house.

35:18.130 --> 35:23.806
I would ask you to consider if prudence is
the appropriate response in this situation.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.830
I thank you for your
thoughts, agent walker.

35:26.860 --> 35:31.414
Until you can provide me with more
intel on what's going on in there,

35:31.460 --> 35:36.010
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

35:36.020 --> 35:39.200
Keep me apprised of any
further developments.

35:42.450 --> 35:43.990
All he's interested in
is covering his own ass.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.790
He's the vice president.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.740
Right now, he's calling the shots.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.490
It was the right call, sir.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.480
You can't order an operation that results in the
president's death and your
own elevation to the job.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.220
It would be politically untenable.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.620
Never let anyone hear you
talking like that, Derek.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.390
–Understood?
–Yes, sir.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.030
oh, my God, Aaron!

36:31.060 --> 36:32.710
They would've heard those shots,

36:32.750 --> 36:35.520
so you're going to need to get the
signal out before they get back.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.330
There's a security kit behind
that door in the bureau.

36:39.370 --> 36:41.840
It's got first aid and a flashlight.

36:41.870 --> 36:43.930
You'll flash Morse code out the window.

36:43.970 --> 36:47.010
Reach in my jacket. I got a pen. Here.

36:48.110 --> 36:51.840
Give it to me. Give me your hand.

36:54.810 --> 36:59.030
this is called “code green.” A dot is
a short blink; a dash is a long one.

36:59.070 --> 37:03.430
“Code green” will signal
them to move in. Go!

37:32.780 --> 37:36.920
general Juma, I have
the president's daughter.

37:41.390 --> 37:44.470
Bring him.

38:05.400 --> 38:10.360
Sources have confirmed that the siege inside the
white house began approximately 40 minutes ago.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.660
We do not yet have confirmation on
the number of hostages being held,

38:13.700 --> 38:15.760
or if the president is among them.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.990
Behind me, you can see dozen of
tactical assault units standing by.

38:20.030 --> 38:24.440
Government analysts tell us the order to
launch any operation in these circumstances

38:24.480 --> 38:26.950
would rest with the vice president.

38:27.610 --> 38:32.750
General, I discovered fiber-optic
cameras embedded in the chandelier.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.670
–Get me a chair.
–Yes, general.

39:12.550 --> 39:15.390
He spotted the cameras.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.890
Give me a secure channel.

39:19.900 --> 39:22.520
Go ahead, sir.

39:22.540 --> 39:27.520
President Taylor, I see now
that you've been watching us.

39:27.530 --> 39:31.910
Good. There is something
I think you should see.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.460
God, no.

39:44.970 --> 39:48.010
If you don't open the door,

39:48.020 --> 39:53.480
I'm going to cut out your
daughter's eyes one by one.

39:53.890 --> 39:58.530
And then I'm going to
cut out her tongue…

40:00.080 --> 40:02.930
–and then her head.
–Mom, don't listen!

40:02.940 --> 40:04.788
I know what you're thinking.

40:04.810 --> 40:08.350
How do you know if you open
the door that I won't kill her?

40:08.390 --> 40:13.370
All you need to know is that I most
certainly will kill her if you don't.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.080
–open the door.
–Madam president,

40:20.120 --> 40:24.040
–No. Open the door. Open the door!
–I can't! I can't!

40:24.510 --> 40:27.870
That is my daughter out
there. Do you understand?

40:27.880 --> 40:30.230
I've already lost my son.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.230
Have you any idea what
it's like to lose a child?

40:33.270 --> 40:36.760
Madam president, I am genuinely
sorry, but I cannot let them take you.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.620
There is nothing you can do for her now.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.220
Do you have children, Jack?

40:44.600 --> 40:47.220
I have a daughter.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.060
Could you do what
you're asking me to do?

40:49.100 --> 40:51.690
Just stand by and watch her butchered?

40:51.740 --> 40:56.550
No, ma'am. But I am not the
president of the United States.

40:56.810 --> 40:58.900
Well, I am the president.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.690
And I am ordering you to open that door.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.430
You're running out of time.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.880
mom…

41:29.920 --> 41:33.550
perhaps this will make your
mother decide more quickly.

41:57.660 --> 41:59.970
mom, you shouldn't have…

41:59.980 --> 42:03.340
I wouldn't let them hurt you, darling.

42:08.420 --> 42:11.090
Damn it, Bauer. What have you done?

42:18.430 --> 42:21.510
all right, general, you've got me now.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.940
There's no reason to hold anyone else.

42:24.950 --> 42:27.430
Let them go.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.910
You… don't give orders to me.

42:40.330 --> 42:43.470
Get the camera ready for her statement.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.120
What statement?

42:46.700 --> 42:49.840
The last one you'll ever give.
