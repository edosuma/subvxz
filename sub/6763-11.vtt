Completely self-taught.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.772
Yeah?
That's what they all say.

03:09.856 --> 03:10.940

03:11.024 --> 03:14.819

you doing here?

03:23.161 --> 03:24.454
No. You know, what I do want

{\an1}Uh... No.
Not really.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.801
{\an3}Andrea Zuckerman,
Sue Scanlon.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.802
Hi.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.845
Hi.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.305
Listen, Gil, I'm not kidding.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.515
My mom's going to kill me
if I fail freshman English.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.600
{\an3}Sue...

03:45.683 --> 03:47.143
{\an1}Look, I'll just
leave you two

03:47.226 --> 03:51.314
{\an1}to, uh...
take care of business.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.107
Sue, it's hard to
get decent grades

03:53.191 --> 03:54.359
{\an3}if you're cutting
class all the time.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.777
Well, couldn't I just

03:55.860 --> 03:57.779
do an independent
study project instead?

03:57.862 --> 04:00.657
I mean, I really
do work better one-on-one.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.325
Tell you what.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.327
Come by tomorrow,

04:04.410 --> 04:06.162
{\an1}and we'll talk
about it.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.748
And don't let your
mom get you down.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.249
{\an1}SUE:
See ya.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.889
You're late.

04:24.973 --> 04:25.348
Only by four minutes

04:25.431 --> 04:27.850
and 13 seconds.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.644
Are you making fun of me?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.354
No.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.815
You can forget about going out
for the rest of the week.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.400
{\an3}And next week, too,
for that matter.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.609
But, Mom, you said I could...

04:36.693 --> 04:38.027
Uncle Henry is coming tomorrow.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.611
He'll be sleeping here
in Scotty's room.

04:41.948 --> 04:42.490
Well, why can't he stay

04:42.573 --> 04:46.828
downstairs
in the den?

04:46.911 --> 04:48.579
Mom, you haven't let anybody
touch this room

04:48.663 --> 04:51.040
for a whole year.
I mean, not since Scotty died.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.041
Excuse me, Sue Scanlon.

04:52.125 --> 04:52.959
When you have a family
and a home

04:53.042 --> 04:54.544
{\an3}of your own, you can
decide who sleeps where.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.505
It's only fitting that
Henry should stay here.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.341
He was Scotty's favorite uncle.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.509
(door closes)

05:06.931 --> 05:08.975
I thought Office Service
was supposed to be fun.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.685
{\an1}You get to know
who's coming in late

05:10.768 --> 05:12.395
and who's flunking out.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
{\an3}Mostly I just deliver
notes for Mrs. Teasley.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.566
What's Sue in for?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.527
{\an3}She practically
lives here.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.071
Hi, Sue.
Hi.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.407
All right, I have
to go pick up the attendance.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.909
{\an6}Well, wait. Where do I
put the announcements
for the Art Fair?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.453
{\an1}Just put it with
all the other folders,

05:28.536 --> 05:29.454
and don't peek in the files.

05:36.335 --> 05:39.422
Listen, Sue,
we never got a chance to talk

05:39.505 --> 05:40.590
about what happened
between you and David

05:40.673 --> 05:41.716
at the dance last week.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.592
You don't have to worry, Donna.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.886
He doesn't mean anything to me.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.096
I know you don't mean that.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.767
I don't want you to have
to feel weird around David now.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.477
Look, I told you
I'd stay away from him.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.688
You don't have to do that.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.107
Look, Sue,
David does care about you.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.984
But there is
a difference

06:00.068 --> 06:01.944
between romantic love
and affection shown

06:02.028 --> 06:04.447
from a friend who's almost
like part of your family.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.948
I know that, Donna.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.367
I know all about it. Okay?

06:09.619 --> 06:10.995
{\an1}Now, hold it
just a moment.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.330
I'm in shock here.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.956
Brandon is coming
to a dance club?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.291
Like, to have fun?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.459
{\an3}Oh, he's
been practicing.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.502
And he's going to
show you guys up.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.630
Kingston 12,
here we come!

06:20.713 --> 06:22.131
I haven't been.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.591
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.301
{\an1}Kingston 12?
You're kidding, right?

06:25.384 --> 06:26.302
Good luck, Baryshnikov.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.555
Can't wait to compare moves
with you, big guy.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.518
Brandon, could it be

06:33.601 --> 06:37.522
{\an1}that you're becoming
open-minded in your old age?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.482
{\an3}More like
feebleminded, Bren.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.151
What am I thinking about?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.486
I hate dancing.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.821
Nikki likes it.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.947
Yeah.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.615
So, you and Dylan
want to come with?

06:47.698 --> 06:50.827
{\an1}It looks doubtful,
at the rate he's going.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.702
{\an1}You know, I'm really
worried about him.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.830
What did the doctor say?

06:53.913 --> 06:54.664
{\an3}You know how you
feel about dancing?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.791
{\an3}That's how he feels
about doctors.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.500
(coughing)

06:57.583 --> 06:59.502
{\an1}Hey, D,
how's that cough?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.587
It's all right.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.548
How you doing?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.591
{\an3}(coughing)

07:05.675 --> 07:09.387
{\an5}SUE:
I don't get why
Mrs. Teasley hates me.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.555
I mean, what did I do to her?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.391
I begged her
not to call my mother,

07:13.474 --> 07:15.184
{\an1}but she said
that she has to.

07:15.268 --> 07:15.726
{\an3}You're really going
through a tough patch

07:15.810 --> 07:18.354
right now, aren't you?

07:18.437 --> 07:20.648
I mean, so what
if I flunk out?

07:20.731 --> 07:22.942
My mom would
probably die of shame.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.236
{\an1}She thinks her
daughter's a deadbeat.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.195
{\an3}Do you think
you're a deadbeat?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.698
Sometimes I just think
I'd be better off dead.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.699
I mean, it should have been me,

07:29.782 --> 07:31.534
not my brother.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.370
I'm sorry.

07:34.453 --> 07:37.498
For what? For being honest?

07:37.582 --> 07:40.042
We all get down
on ourselves sometimes,

07:40.126 --> 07:40.710
but you get through it.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.712
You've just
got to focus

07:42.795 --> 07:43.713
{\an3}on the good things
in your life.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.382
{\an3}The things that are
worth sticking around for.

07:46.465 --> 07:49.719
Like what? There's nothing.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.554
Well...

07:51.637 --> 07:54.682
if you weren't around,
you wouldn't know me.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.600
See what you would

07:55.683 --> 07:58.436
be missing out on?

07:58.519 --> 07:59.896
Are you conceited or what?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.939
Of course I am.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.399
Did I detect a smile there?

08:03.482 --> 08:06.402
Hmm? Almost?

08:06.485 --> 08:09.739
I came here to talk
about grades and papers.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.782
Here you are,
trying to cheer me up.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.786
You really are different.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.998
So are you.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.210
Sue, you're a very special girl.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.253
You just need
to believe it.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.442
GIL:
<i>What do the works</i>

08:46.525 --> 08:49.111
of Poe, Hawthorne and Crane
have in common?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.489
Can anyone tell me?

08:51.572 --> 08:52.657
{\an3}Brandon?

08:52.740 --> 08:57.620
Uh... Well,
they're all very... dark,

08:57.703 --> 09:00.248
{\an1}for lack
of a better word.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.832
No, that's exactly
the right word.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.460
And they all rely heavily
on symbolism

09:04.543 --> 09:07.088
as they explore
the dark side of humanity.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.507
Mr. Meyers.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.592
Thank you, Ms. Walsh.
Uh... Mrs. Teasley

09:11.676 --> 09:13.469
{\an6}said you should
look at it as
soon as possible.

09:13.552 --> 09:16.264
Excuse me. We're trying
to learn something here.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.765
I doubt that, Brandon.

09:24.605 --> 09:28.526
Um... Where were we?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.486
On the dark side.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.823
I don't get it.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.824
First, he bails
in the middle of AP,

09:34.907 --> 09:38.119
and then he's a no-show
for the staff meeting.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.621
It's just very
out of character for Gil.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.831
{\an1}Is it?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.624
You don't think so?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.168
{\an6}Let's just say,
the more I get
to know Mr. Meyers,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.629
{\an3}the less about
him surprises me.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.007
So, Brandon, when do you want
to get together and do...?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.466
{\an1}The meeting. The meeting
that we're having.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.634
Right. The meeting.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.510
What meeting?

09:54.593 --> 09:56.178
{\an1}Uh... Well, it's
a very private meeting.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.346
It's a guy thing.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.681
Would you excuse us?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.308
How's Friday?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.143
That doesn't give you
much time to practice.

10:02.226 --> 10:02.893
Silver, you told me
you could teach me

10:02.977 --> 10:05.521
{\an1}how to dance
in one session.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.857
Did I say that?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.526
{\an3}Oh, my God! You're right.
He's burning up!

10:10.609 --> 10:11.569
Okay, so I'll go home.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.404
I'll watch some videos,
drink some chicken soup.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.531
{\an1}The only place you're
going is to the doctor's.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.490
{\an3}Brenda....
Dylan,

10:16.574 --> 10:18.409
stop being so macho.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.704
Now, even if you feel better
in a day or two,

10:21.787 --> 10:23.372
I want you to finish
the whole prescription.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.707
Thanks, Doc. I will.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.668
Good to see you, Dylan.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.378
And happy birthday.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.755
{\an1}Yeah, I bet you never thought
I'd make it to 18, huh?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.882
{\an3}I was afraid you wouldn't
make it to eight.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.510
{\an6}Have you been in
any more motorcycle
accidents recently?

10:36.594 --> 10:39.221
No, but I did bruise
some ribs surfing last year.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.308
Surfing? Where? Santa Monica?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.560
No, no. There are no waves
there anymore.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
(coughing)

10:46.604 --> 10:49.398
Mostly, I go up to Malibu
'cause the water's cleaner.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.901
Look, Dylan,
don't fool yourself.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.070
You have to read the signs.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.280
After a big rain,
you can find all sorts

10:56.364 --> 10:58.407
of nasty bacteria
in the channel.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.868
Oh, yeah. But, Doc, when you see
a four-foot set rolling in,

11:00.951 --> 11:02.953
it's kind of hard
to stay out of the water.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.914
{\an3}Look, Dylan,
do yourself a favor.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.751
{\an3}Try some indoor
sports for a change.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.463
(coughing)

11:12.546 --> 11:14.548
DAVID:
That's it for today, kiddies.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.425
And for those of you thinking
of cutting classes, remember,

11:16.509 --> 11:19.929
don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.306
All right. I'll tell
you what I find out.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.432
{\an3}Okay.
How you doing, man?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.266
{\an1}Doing good.
How you doing?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.935
{\an3}All right.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.229
AP English just isn't
interesting without Meyers here.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.271
I hope he's all right.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.773
He's been gone
since Tuesday.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.774
{\an3}Checked on him
at home?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.275
{\an1}Nah. His machine's on
all the time.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.236
{\an1}That reminds me.
I was going to ask you.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.904
Do you know where
4580 Malibu Coast Drive is?

11:36.987 --> 11:38.906
{\an1}Uh... yeah. It's
right by where I surf.

11:38.989 --> 11:39.907
Why? What's up there?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.951
That's where Gil lives.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.078
{\an3}I thought I might
stop in say hi, you know.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.955
Oh, yeah.
That's a great place to live.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.039
And I miss those waves.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.292
Strep throat's gnarly stuff.
You look better though.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.502
You know, I hate to admit it,

11:51.585 --> 11:52.837
but antibiotics,
they work sometimes.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.963
{\an3}Well, you know, four out of
five doctors surveyed....

11:54.046 --> 11:56.340
Hey, you guys,
I've got some bad news.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.466
Gil Meyers is in big trouble.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.801
What do you mean?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.136
Well, you know how he likes

12:00.219 --> 12:01.429
to flirt with all the girls?

12:01.512 --> 12:03.639
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:03.722 --> 12:04.849
Well, this time he may have
taken it too far.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.476
I don't know all the details,

12:07.560 --> 12:08.144
but he's been
"relieved of his duties

12:08.227 --> 12:09.812
pending an investigation",

12:09.895 --> 12:10.980
quote unquote.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.482
What kind of investigation?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.735
For "sexual misconduct
with a female student".

12:27.413 --> 12:28.664
When'd the doc say

12:28.747 --> 12:30.166
you could get back
in the water, man?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.459
I don't know.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.169
{\an1}Man, looks like
a killer set coming in.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.837
Yes, I know!

12:34.920 --> 12:36.005
Brandon, would you look
at that water?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.673
Have you ever seen anything
more beautiful?

12:37.756 --> 12:39.008
{\an1}I'm gonna go knock
on Meyers' door.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.009
You gonna be all right?

12:40.092 --> 12:41.469
Yeah, I'm just
gonna hang out.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.553
{\an1}Cool.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.641
MEYERS:
<i>So, the subs aren't cutting it?</i>

12:47.725 --> 12:48.976
Well, let's just say

12:49.059 --> 12:52.021
these people aren't
AP English teachers.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.647
Fourth-grade math maybe.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.150
{\an3}(chuckles):
I'm sorry about that.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.902
{\an1}I hope they find
someone,

12:57.985 --> 13:00.988
{\an1}but mid-year,
it'll be tough.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.364
Well, you'll be
back, won't you?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
{\an3}I mean, how long is
this hearing gonna take?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.535
Brandon, I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.037
That's all right, I'll just ask
you questions,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.038
you can nod your head yes or no,

13:09.121 --> 13:10.080
like in
<i>All The President's Men</i>

13:10.164 --> 13:11.957
You know, Woodward
and Bernstein?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.210
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.961
You sound like you're giving up,

13:16.045 --> 13:17.546
{\an3}like you're leaving,
but at the hearing....

13:17.630 --> 13:19.757
Brandon, there's not gonna be
a hearing, because I <i> am</i> leaving.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.050
If I go quietly

13:21.133 --> 13:22.927
and don't fight it,
then Mrs...

13:23.010 --> 13:24.094
the girl's mother

13:24.178 --> 13:27.097
{\an1}will drop the matter
and they'll close the books.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.891
But why would you want
to do that?

13:28.974 --> 13:31.268
Why do you think?

13:31.352 --> 13:32.603
Come on, Gil, you gotta fight
this thing.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.646
You gotta clear your name.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.105
Brandon, I told you,
I don't wanna discuss it.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.081
Hi.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.876
{\an1}Hi. Um, I was just writing
a note,

13:55.960 --> 13:58.712
but I decided not to.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.881
Do you remember me?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.926
Uh, yeah, from the other night
at the Peach Pit.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.930
Right, and I was also out there
in the hall

14:08.013 --> 14:09.265
the other day.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.936
{\an3}You looked pretty upset
when you ran out of here.

14:14.019 --> 14:14.270
You're from the newspaper,
right?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.230
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.774
But I'm not looking
for a story from you.

14:18.857 --> 14:19.984
Why not?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.151
I imagine you prefer

14:21.235 --> 14:22.778
to keep your personal
business private.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.281
Well, why do you care
what I prefer?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.658
Nobody else does.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.118
{\an3}Look, Sue,

14:29.201 --> 14:31.078
{\an3}I'm involved with something
called "peer counseling."

14:31.161 --> 14:32.079
I'm not interested.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.331
{\an3}Do you know
what it's about?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.125
{\an1}It's like having a kid
for a therapist!

14:36.208 --> 14:37.793
No, thanks!
It's not a therapist.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.587
{\an3}It's someone you
can talk to,

14:39.670 --> 14:41.589
{\an3}someone who can understand
how you're feeling.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.132
And how are you supposed
to understand how I feel?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.302
Because I once
had a teacher

14:46.385 --> 14:48.137
that I really cared for.

14:48.220 --> 14:53.142
{\an6}Someone I thought
I was falling
in love with.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.144
And what happened?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.438
Look, if I,
I tell you about this,

14:57.521 --> 14:58.522
I want us to have
an understanding.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.149
{\an3}I don't want to share
my feelings with everybody,

15:00.232 --> 15:02.151
just you.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.986
Well, I wouldn't tell anyone.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.155
And the same goes
for stuff you tell me,

15:06.238 --> 15:09.199
{\an3}okay?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.200
Okay.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.995
Good. Come on.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.080
(doorbell rings)

15:17.541 --> 15:18.167
{\an1}Andrea, hi.
Brandon's not here.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.209
Well, that's okay.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.045
Actually, I came by
to talk to you.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.172
I was hoping I could ask you
some questions.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.966
Step into my office.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.847
But why are you so interested
in Sue?

15:31.930 --> 15:33.599
Is it because
of Gil Meyers?

15:33.682 --> 15:34.725
How did you know

15:34.808 --> 15:35.893
Sue was involved?

15:35.976 --> 15:36.852
Well, it's all over
school by now.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.020
{\an3}I mean, you can't keep
that kind of thing

15:38.103 --> 15:39.063
a secret for very long.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.147
Well, you were her senior buddy.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.190
What's the story with her?

15:41.273 --> 15:43.942
Well, according to Donna,

15:44.026 --> 15:46.487
the Scanlon family never really
recovered from Scott's death.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.490
{\an6}Sue's dad just kind
of checked out of
it emotionally.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.992
And her mom
is a major control freak.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.161
So, she's just kind
of an innocent victim

15:54.244 --> 15:55.746
in all this.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.666
Well, with the way that she came
on to David at the Pigskin Prom,

15:58.749 --> 16:00.501
I don't think you can really
call her "innocent".

16:00.584 --> 16:02.336
Brenda, get ready for this one!

16:02.419 --> 16:03.712
You'll be interested
in this, too.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.092
I found out who accused
Mr. Meyers: Sue Scanlon.

16:09.343 --> 16:13.722
This is not news to you.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.933
I'm always the last to know.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.018
How come you're so chipper?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.144
Well, I couldn't figure out

16:19.228 --> 16:21.063
why a mother would just let
a sex offender walk away

16:21.146 --> 16:23.232
unless she knew the charges
were totally bogus.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.735
And now that we find out who
the so-called "victim" is,

16:26.819 --> 16:27.736
it all makes sense.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.738
Wait a minute!

16:29.822 --> 16:31.782
What makes you think

16:31.865 --> 16:32.908
{\an1}that Sue's not telling
the truth?

16:32.991 --> 16:34.702
Gil did not deny the
accusations, did he?

16:34.785 --> 16:35.911
That's because he can't.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.162
That's part
of their little deal.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.083
Brandon, are you aware there has
never been an unfounded claim

16:41.166 --> 16:42.918
of sexual abuse
at West Beverly High?

16:43.001 --> 16:45.546
Well, that doesn't mean
there can never be one.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.089
And this girl is a nut, right?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.340
Well, let's just say
she's troubled.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.135
You are doing

16:51.218 --> 16:54.096
exactly what society
has done to women

16:54.179 --> 16:55.097
for centuries;
you are blaming the victim.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.266
She should not be on trial!

16:57.349 --> 17:00.477
And what about being innocent
until proven guilty, huh?!

17:00.561 --> 17:02.771
He should have the right
to confront his accuser!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.189
Excuse me,
he does have that right

17:04.272 --> 17:06.900
and he's just chosen
not to exercise it.

17:06.983 --> 17:07.943
There's a difference.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.444
{\an3}That's because Mrs.
Scanlon's pressuring him!

17:09.528 --> 17:10.279
Or maybe it's because
he's not innocent.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.406
Have you thought of that?

17:14.074 --> 17:16.076
Look, the only reason
that you wanna believe Gil

17:16.160 --> 17:17.286
is because he's the guy,
and you can relate to that.

17:17.368 --> 17:21.290
Yeah, okay, I like to think
Gil and I have a lot in common.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.001
But what you and Sue have
in common, that is beyond me!

17:24.084 --> 17:26.502
Yeah, I guess it is.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.132
Good night, Brenda.

17:37.347 --> 17:41.977
Well, I think Andrea will accept
your apology... eventually.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.062
So, you think she's right
about Gil?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.814
Brandon, I don't know.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.901
I mean, I'm sure Sue is capable
of telling a few lies

17:48.984 --> 17:49.401
here and there,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.195
but I don't think

17:51.278 --> 17:52.279
{\an3}she would hurt Gil
for no reason.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.866
Oh, come on, Bren,
clearly, the girl is screwed up.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.326
(doorbell rings)

17:57.409 --> 17:59.745
{\an1}It's probably Andrea coming
back to apologize to me.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.958
What are you doing here?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.668
Uh, it's a guy thing.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.254
{\an3}(chuckles):
David, I completely forgot.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.799
Oh, well, I didn't,
so, uh, let's do it.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.176
I can't.

18:14.259 --> 18:14.718
I've been working

18:14.802 --> 18:16.470
really hard at school,

18:16.553 --> 18:18.138
and, and with Meyers gone,
the paper's crazy.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.264
It's just not a good night.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.392
Brandon, we're going
to Kingston 12 tomorrow.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.189
How am I supposed
to go to a club

18:27.272 --> 18:28.148
and have a good time

18:28.232 --> 18:30.067
when our school
is in total upheaval, huh?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.360
Oh, please.

18:31.443 --> 18:35.656
And here I wasted
a great alibi on Donna.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.534
Oh, well, can't say
I didn't try.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.536
See you guys around.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.204
Sorry, David.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.083
{\an1}Bren, you won't tell anyone
David Silver came over

18:46.166 --> 18:47.835
{\an1}to give me dancing lessons,
will you?

18:47.918 --> 18:48.919
Oh, on one condition.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.004
{\an3}You actually have
to go to that dance club.

18:51.088 --> 18:51.672
Bren, I'm not....

18:51.755 --> 18:52.381
Brandon, isn't it about time

18:52.464 --> 18:53.131
you dropped this "I am what I am

18:53.215 --> 18:54.383
and I can't change" lame
attitude,

18:54.466 --> 18:57.594
and realize that you have a very
nice, very sexy girlfriend

18:57.678 --> 18:58.428
who wants to dance with you?

18:58.512 --> 19:01.932
{\an3}In other words,
don't blow this one.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.585
Working weekends, Zuckerman?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.254
{\an1}I just don't like leaving
any loose ends.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.465
I just came to pick up
some of my things.

19:35.549 --> 19:39.386
I can't believe you took
advantage of a girl

19:39.469 --> 19:41.305
just because
she had a crush on you.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.431
Excuse me?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.100
I know what happened.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.894
I know who was involved.

19:46.977 --> 19:50.397
{\an1}I saw her running out
of your classroom on Monday.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.481
For what it's worth,
I want you to know

19:51.565 --> 19:55.444
that I did not abuse
or make a pass at that girl.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.447
I don't know how you define
the word "abuse".

19:58.530 --> 20:01.325
{\an4}All I know
is that she was hurt
and you were the cause.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.452
I was trying to help her.

20:03.535 --> 20:08.457
Do you really have
so little faith in me?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.543
Kids just don't make up
these things.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.798
{\an1}You're not even putting up
a defense!

20:16.882 --> 20:17.841
You're just running away.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.635
{\an1}Andrea, the reason
I'm taking that deal

20:19.718 --> 20:20.469
{\an1}is that I think
Sue is in trouble.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.013
I don't think she can handle

20:23.096 --> 20:23.722
a confrontational hearing
right now.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.683
Oh, so you're just being noble?

20:26.767 --> 20:30.145
You, you're protecting her
even though you know

20:30.228 --> 20:31.438
{\an3}your whole teaching
career is on the line?

20:31.521 --> 20:33.941
At least if I leave
on their terms,

20:34.024 --> 20:36.276
I might still have
a teaching career.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.486
I know I can do
a lot of other things,

20:37.569 --> 20:42.032
but I just happen to like
working with young people.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.492
Maybe you like it
a little too much.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.453
Maybe I do,
but I can live with that.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.331
What I cannot live with
is having two suicides

20:49.414 --> 20:50.374
on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.751
What do you mean?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.551
On my first teaching job,
there was a girl...

21:01.635 --> 21:04.846
a very troubled girl,

21:04.930 --> 21:11.687
but she was very bright,
beautiful, an amazing girl.

21:11.770 --> 21:17.484
She fell in love with me, but I
did what I was supposed to do.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.861
I held the line.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.614
I even pushed her away.

21:22.698 --> 21:26.618
I was very clear,
and she killed herself.

21:31.248 --> 21:31.790
Because of you?

21:31.873 --> 21:35.252
That's what the note said.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.797
So you see, Andrea,

21:38.880 --> 21:41.591
{\an1}I am not about to publicly
call Sue Scanlon a liar.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.554
{\an1}As long as I know the truth,
that's all that matters.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.514
{\an3}For you, but
what about for her?

21:47.597 --> 21:52.436
I think I'm just about
the last person

21:52.519 --> 21:53.520
that can help her right now.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.398
If you want
to take a stab at it,

21:56.481 --> 21:57.858
be my guest.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.201
{\an5}GIL:
Well, if it isn't
the birthday boy.

22:08.285 --> 22:08.952
DYLAN:
Hey, how are ya?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.829
{\an1}How come you're
landlocked today?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.581
Oh, it's my doctor.

22:12.664 --> 22:17.085
She said that the water quality
is detrimental to my health.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.879
It's a shame, isn't it?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.088
Oh, man, it's a travesty.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.631
I mean, here we have this
beautiful natural resource

22:21.715 --> 22:24.593
{\an3}and we're turning it
into a trash heap!

22:24.676 --> 22:25.844
You sound motivated.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.389
You know, Friends of the Bay
can always use more volunteers.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.599
That's a good
organization.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.976
{\an3}I'll probably
check them out.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.271
So, uh, how's it
going with you?

22:36.354 --> 22:40.108
Ah, up and down, you know.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.651
{\an3}Listen, I, I don't even
know what happened,

22:41.735 --> 22:44.905
{\an3}and I don't usually ask
these kinds of questions,

22:44.988 --> 22:47.783
{\an3}but I was talking
to Brandon, and he told me.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.951
I gotta tell you,
if it were me...

22:50.035 --> 22:51.745
{\an3}if I were accused
of something I didn't do,

22:51.828 --> 22:53.580
{\an3}I'd be out of here, man--
no explanations, no defense.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.624
Nothing, I'm gone.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.126
Thanks, Dylan.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.089
{\an1}But you know, some things
just aren't black and white.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.132
{\an3}Yeah, well, I wasn't
there, so....

23:04.216 --> 23:07.302
{\an1}I mean, if that girl
got the wrong message,

23:07.385 --> 23:08.929
maybe it was my fault.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.472
I don't know, man.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.891
{\an3}You can always
second-guess yourself.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.769
{\an3}You know,
hindsight's 20/20.

23:15.852 --> 23:16.603
Maybe so.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.688
So what are you gonna do?

23:18.772 --> 23:19.689
(laughing)

23:19.773 --> 23:21.566
You got any suggestions?

23:24.361 --> 23:25.987
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>Thanks for paying for me,</i>
<i>Steve, but that doesn't mean</i>

23:26.071 --> 23:27.781
this is a date, does it?
No, no.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.990
But it does mean you
have to dance with me.

23:29.074 --> 23:29.783
If you insist.
Thank you.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.285
{\an4}Let's go.
Hey, hey,
hey, easy now.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.995
We've got all night.
Anybody want a drink?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.038
Yeah, I'll have a soda.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.874
{\an1}Not until you work up
a sweat first.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.751
Okay, I love this song.

23:40.919 --> 23:41.503
Hey, how you doing?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.797
You want to dance?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.215
I'd love to, but
I'm with someone.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.299
No, no, it's all right.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.300
You go ahead.
I'll sit this one out.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.343
Are you sure?

23:48.426 --> 23:48.552
Yeah.

What's Brandon's problem?

25:07.714 --> 25:09.758
{\an1}Oh, he has a major
hang-up about dancing.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.844
Really?
Is he ever going to get over it?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.596
Well, maybe he needs

Enough?
We're just getting started.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.963
Come on, Nikki, you're making
a spectacle of yourself here.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.798
Oh, am I having too good a time?

25:49.881 --> 25:50.966
Is that it?
Is that the problem, Brandon?

25:51.049 --> 25:53.718
Excuse me if I don't enjoy
watching you bump and grind

25:53.802 --> 25:54.803
with every guy in here.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.637
Brandon, take it easy.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.764
I will.

25:57.847 --> 26:01.101
You take her home.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.110
Andrea, hi.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.361
Hi.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.821
{\an3}My mom was really sorry
that she didn't

26:12.904 --> 26:14.155
get to meet you
the other day.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.616
{\an3}So she wanted me to
invite you over tonight

26:16.700 --> 26:18.410
{\an3}for dinner.
Tonight?

26:18.493 --> 26:20.036
Please?

26:20.120 --> 26:20.829
Sure.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.290
Okay, I'll see you later.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.672
{\an3}Say, Brandon, did you
and Nikki ever make up?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.841
{\an1}I don't believe I've made up
with you yet, Steve.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.801
Aw, come on.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.219
{\an3}I was just trying to
get you off your rump.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.679
Uh-huh, and who asked you?

26:37.762 --> 26:39.681
I'll tell you what,

26:39.764 --> 26:42.183
{\an3}if you and Nikki
ever break up,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.185
you let me know, okay?

26:44.269 --> 26:44.728
God.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.408
Hey, Nikki, um...

26:58.491 --> 26:59.826
if you're willing to talk,

26:59.909 --> 27:02.704
{\an1}I just want to
tell you I'm sorry.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.913
For what?

27:03.997 --> 27:07.709
{\an3}Telling me off, or
not dancing with me?

27:07.792 --> 27:10.712
Both.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.048
{\an5}Look, Brandon,
I just think in
a relationship,

27:13.131 --> 27:14.924
{\an3}there's some differences
you can live with

27:15.008 --> 27:15.925
and some you can't.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.387
{\an1}And how do you know so much
about relationships?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.722
Because I'm a girl.

27:20.805 --> 27:21.890
And that's what girls do.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.518
Mm.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.105
{\an3}So do we get to kiss
and make up now?

27:29.189 --> 27:32.400
{\an1}It's not going to be
that easy.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.694
There's still the issue:

27:34.778 --> 27:37.280
one dances and the
other one doesn't.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.865
What do you want
me to do, Nikki?

27:38.948 --> 27:41.993
{\an3}I have no rhythm,
end of story.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.954
Okay.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.915
How 'bout this?

27:46.998 --> 27:49.167
One private dance lesson.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.710
Your home turf.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.087
Your favorite music.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.757
{\an1}Your favorite
dance instructor.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.717
{\an1}You give it your all
one time,

27:57.801 --> 27:59.302
just, just one time,

27:59.386 --> 27:59.969
and if you truly
have no rhythm,

28:00.053 --> 28:02.680
{\an1}I will never
complain again.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.559
All right, you got a deal.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.270
You want half my sandwich?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.231
Oh, no thanks.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.899
{\an1}I think you've lost about
five pounds in the last week.

28:12.982 --> 28:16.111
Yeah, well, it's called
learning the hard way.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.738
What's the Coastal
Waters Initiative?

28:18.822 --> 28:19.948
{\an3}It's a measure on
the ballot this year.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.951
{\an3}The people down at Friends
of the Bay turned me on to it,

28:23.034 --> 28:25.120
{\an3}seeing as how I've reached
the age of majority.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.789
{\an1}You get to vote for it.
How cool.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.290
{\an3}All I gotta do is register.
I'm pretty stoked.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.792
I'm bummed!

28:30.875 --> 28:32.794
How incredibly unfair.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.712
Who would've known
you had to register

28:34.796 --> 28:36.131
30 days before
the election?

28:36.214 --> 28:37.966
Anyone who'd read this
information pamphlet.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.467
I'm sorry.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.802
{\an1}So am I.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.846
{\an3}I'll just have to try
and cheer you up.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.347
Better not.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.599
{\an1}Doc Littman says I might
still be contagious.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.017
{\an1}Ooh, bummer.
Yeah.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.941
Hi.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.321
{\an1}I'm sorry.
You shouldn't come in.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.364
What's the matter?

29:01.448 --> 29:05.827
I know I invited you over,
but I made a mistake.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.164
Oh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.832
Sue, what are you...?

29:10.915 --> 29:13.001
Oh, hi, you must be Andrea.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.838
I'm so happy to meet you.
Come in.

29:19.966 --> 29:24.721
{\an1}Henry, I'd like you
to meet someone.

29:24.804 --> 29:25.096
This is Andrea Zookerman.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.848
Zuckerman.

29:26.931 --> 29:27.891
{\an1}Zuckerman.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.017
{\an4}Uh, uh, this is
my brother, Henry.
Hi.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.645
We knew a Zuckerman family
in Oklahoma City.

29:32.729 --> 29:33.980
I believe they were mortgage
brokers, any relation?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.899
I don't think so.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.358
{\an3}I've never been
to Oklahoma before.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.194
{\an1}Sue's spent the last five
summers in Oklahoma.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.362
{\an3}Uh, we're gonna
go upstairs.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.572
No, you're not.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.324
{\an1}We're gonna start
eating soon.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.200
{\an1}Did you know
that Sue's friend

29:45.283 --> 29:47.869
is the smartest girl
in West Beverly High,

29:47.952 --> 29:50.163
{\an1}and she is going
to Yale next year?

29:50.246 --> 29:52.207
{\an3}I'm not the smartest,
believe me,

29:52.290 --> 29:53.082
{\an3}and I've just applied
to Yale; I didn't get...

29:53.166 --> 29:55.835
And she is the editor
of the school paper.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.504
Editor-in-chief?

29:57.587 --> 29:58.505
Is that right?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.006
{\an3}Well, actually, this year
I'm the co-editor.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.049
Maybe Sue could do some
writing for the paper.

30:01.132 --> 30:02.926
{\an3}Well, sure,
if she'd like to.

30:03.009 --> 30:06.095
You know, I used to write
for my high school paper.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.847
Did you really?
Susan,

30:07.931 --> 30:08.890
{\an1}get your brothers
and sisters.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.392
We're gonna start dinner.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.061
Trouble was, if I didn't
have a good story,

30:13.144 --> 30:16.898
well, I'd just make one up.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.567
{\an3}(laughs)

30:19.651 --> 30:20.902
Ah, such a kidder.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.404
NIKKI:
<i>Brandon, no one will</i>

30:23.488 --> 30:24.656
see you.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.908
Nobody's home.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.244
The doors are locked.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.704
{\an1}I tell you what,
I'll even turn my back.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.081
(music playing)

30:33.164 --> 30:35.083
You did agree to this.
I did?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.417
Yes, you did.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.253
Now come on.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.087
{\an1}Come on, Brandon.
Just loosen up.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.548
Uh, start with
the feet first.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.924
Don't even worry
about the hands.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.553
You follow me, Brandon.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.097
Brandon!

30:49.180 --> 30:50.723
That's not what
I call giving it your all.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.267
{\an1}You're not giving it
your anything.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.270
Well, you see that music
just wasn't quite right.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.356
{\an3}Now this music
I like much better.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.107
(ballad plays)

30:59.190 --> 31:01.776
You want to slow dance?

31:01.859 --> 31:03.236
Yeah, any objections?

31:03.319 --> 31:04.946
No, not at all.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.489
{\an3}Good, 'cause I know
this one dance.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.907
You may have heard of it.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.618
{\an3}It's called the,
uh, Brandon Waltz.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.621
No, no, I haven't heard of it.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.874
I guess you're gonna
have to teach me.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.816
{\an4}ANDREA:
Thank you for dinner,
Mrs. Scanlon. It was great.

31:41.899 --> 31:42.984
{\an1}Oh, you'll have to come
again soon sometime

31:43.067 --> 31:45.778
when Conrad isn't
away on business.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.698
{\an1}But thank heavens we have
Henry here filling in,

31:48.781 --> 31:51.701
guarding the homestead.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.661
{\an1}Why don't we put on
a videotape of the ranch.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.121
{\an4}Then you can see...
You know, I don't think
she's at all interested

31:55.204 --> 31:56.331
in our home movies, Mother.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.708
But we have those
terrific horse shows,

31:58.791 --> 31:59.542
and we have Scotty jumping...

31:59.626 --> 32:01.169
I don't want to see
Scotty jumping.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.212
Scotty is dead.

32:06.924 --> 32:09.969
I have to apologize
for my daughter.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.430
She hasn't been herself
since that...

32:12.513 --> 32:15.850
nasty mess with
that disgusting teacher.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.311
{\an1}Do you have to keep
talking about it?

32:18.394 --> 32:21.022
{\an3}It seems to me
that you were the one

32:21.105 --> 32:22.899
{\an3}who talked about it first,
weren't you, Sue?

32:25.109 --> 32:26.194
Yes, I was.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.236
So if you started it,

32:27.320 --> 32:29.864
well, then you ought
to finish it,

32:29.947 --> 32:30.865
{\an3}don't you think?
Henry...

32:30.948 --> 32:32.742
I'm sorry, but I don't believe

32:32.825 --> 32:35.536
I ever got a clear explanation
of exactly what that whole

32:35.620 --> 32:36.746
{\an3}nasty mess
was all about.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.789
Henry, for heaven's sake.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.833
All I've heard's a lot of talk

32:40.917 --> 32:41.626
{\an3}about how he tried
to seduce her,

32:41.709 --> 32:43.628
{\an3}tried to have
his way with her.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.757
I want to know exactly
what's she's saying he did.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.551
And what she did
to make him think

32:50.635 --> 32:51.719
he could make
such advances.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.222
What are you talking about?
Sue didn't do anything.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.099
Is that right, Sue?

32:56.182 --> 32:59.894
You didn't do
anything, huh?

32:59.977 --> 33:02.230
No.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.314
No, that's not right at all.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.948
I was the one who tried
to seduce him.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.950
Susan!
It's true.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.708
I tried to kiss him,

33:21.791 --> 33:23.376
but he wouldn't let me.

33:25.002 --> 33:26.254
It was me!

33:31.718 --> 33:33.010
(door slams)

33:42.186 --> 33:45.398
So, on behalf of
the entire <i> Blaze</i> staff,

33:45.481 --> 33:47.275
AP English
and everybody else here,

33:47.358 --> 33:48.109
we know this has been
a big ordeal for you, man.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.318
It's good to have you back.

33:49.402 --> 33:53.072
(applause)

33:53.156 --> 33:54.407
{\an1}Thanks for the
support, you guys.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.783
No sweat, man.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.952
I don't think my brother
ever would've gotten over it

33:58.035 --> 33:59.454
if you'd really left.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.164
{\an1}Then it's a good thing
I didn't have to.

34:01.247 --> 34:04.208
I gotta go. I told Mrs. Teasley
I'd be right back.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.295
{\an1}Brandon, I just want
to say, for once,

34:07.378 --> 34:10.965
{\an1}I'm, uh, I'm glad
I was wrong.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.300
Yeah, me, too, Chief.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.013
So are you done
being sick now?

34:17.096 --> 34:17.304
I think so.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.264
Good.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.600
Why?

34:20.683 --> 34:22.143
{\an1}You worried
about me, Kelly?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.228
Hey, what are
friends for?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.322
Listen. I'm... I'm sorry

34:35.406 --> 34:36.324
I jumped to conclusions.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.784
Don't apologize.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.828
You gave me a lot
of food for thought.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.748
Well, at least
you cleared your name.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.667
Yeah, I guess.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.377
You're thinking about Sue,
aren't you?

34:48.460 --> 34:50.797
It's hard not to.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.340
How's she doing?

34:52.422 --> 34:53.841
I don't know.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.842
Her mother's keeping her
in seclusion.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.553
I was planning to drop
by her house later.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.348
If you can help her, whatever
you can do, it'd be great.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.976
(doorbell ringing)

35:04.060 --> 35:06.020
Hi, Mrs. Scanlon.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.230
Is, uh, Sue home?

35:07.313 --> 35:10.817
Sue isn't seeing anyone
but family right now.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.610
{\an1}Sorry.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.404
I just thought that
maybe you could just....

35:18.115 --> 35:19.534
Yeah, but you're
her senior buddy.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.869
{\an3}Look, that's not gonna get me
very far in that household.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.538
{\an1}She shouldn't
be so isolated.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.540
{\an1}I mean, who knows
what she's thinking?

35:25.623 --> 35:28.960
She's probably feeling very
guilty and depressed right now.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.087
{\an1}Well, being shut up
in that house

35:31.170 --> 35:32.380
{\an1}cannot improve
her mental health.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.549
{\an1}That has got to be one
of the spookiest families

35:34.632 --> 35:36.217
{\an1}I've ever been
in contact with.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.219
{\an3}Look, I know, but
what can we do?

35:38.302 --> 35:39.554
(sighs)

35:39.637 --> 35:41.472
Somebody's gotta get in there.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.894
{\an3}And I think I know someone
who has the best chance.

35:46.978 --> 35:47.562
Who?

35:47.645 --> 35:49.605
Don't look at me like that.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.858
Please, Donna. We think
this is a really critical time.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.527
{\an1}Look, Sue hasn't been
in school for days,

35:54.610 --> 35:56.529
and you know how self-
destructive she can be.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.864
Well, what can <i> I</i> do?

35:57.947 --> 35:59.073
You can be her
friend, Donna.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.075
{\an3}She probably thinks
she doesn't have any left.

36:01.158 --> 36:04.161
Well, you don't think
she'd do anything major, do you?

36:04.245 --> 36:05.413
Look, there's
no way to know

36:05.496 --> 36:07.790
if she's suicidal unless we
get in there to talk to her.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.083
But you said yourself

36:09.166 --> 36:10.918
Mrs. Scanlon would not
let anybody in.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.086
Only family.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.338
Well, I'm not exactly considered
a member of the family.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.424
No, but your
boyfriend <i> is.</i>

36:21.345 --> 36:24.265
How did I let myself
get talked into this?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.100
'Cause you care about Sue

36:26.183 --> 36:28.561
{\an6}and you know that Scott
would've wanted you
to look after her.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.771
{\an1}Well, don't you think this
calls for professional help?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.940
Well, maybe it's not
as bad as we think.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.775
{\an3}I mean, Mrs. Scanlon sounded
thrilled to hear from you.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.776
Yeah, well,

36:35.860 --> 36:37.236
any time
Mrs. Scanlon's thrilled,

36:37.320 --> 36:39.071
(doorbell ringing)
you know it's a bad sign.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.829
David! Hi. Um...

36:46.913 --> 36:48.289
Come on in, you guys.

36:48.372 --> 36:48.789
My mom is gonna be

36:48.873 --> 36:50.291
so happy you're here.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.919
David! Oh...

36:53.002 --> 36:55.546
You have gotten so tall now.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.091
Somehow I still expected you
to come up just to my chin.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.676
Yeah, I just kept on growing.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.095
Luckily Donna
sort of leveled off.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.348
Sue, you look good.
How are you feeling?

37:05.431 --> 37:07.808
Fine. How are you?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.477
Sue, go tell Uncle Henry to put
some more meat on the grill.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.604
No, that's okay.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.813
No, no, no, no, no.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.608
{\an1}We're having a barbecue
and you have to stay.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.443
Well, actually,
we were just worried

37:17.526 --> 37:18.819
because Sue wasn't in school.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.112
Yes, well, that school.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.030
That was the problem.

37:21.113 --> 37:23.616
You kids are almost
finished, thank God,

37:23.699 --> 37:25.993
but the thought
of four more years?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.662
Sue would not have survived it.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.038
(chopping)

37:29.121 --> 37:30.831
{\an1}You mean, you're pulling her
out of West Beverly?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.083
Absolutely.

37:32.166 --> 37:32.500
{\an3}Well, where's
she going to go?

37:32.583 --> 37:36.003
We're moving.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.171
We just decided.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.965
{\an1}Conrad is looking
at houses

37:39.048 --> 37:41.801
right now in Oklahoma
near my family.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.511
Oklahoma?

37:43.594 --> 37:45.221
The children need
a healthier environment.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.514
That's all there is to it.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.557
Imagine this:
fresh air, no traffic,

37:48.641 --> 37:52.812
{\an1}a community with
wholesome family values?

37:52.895 --> 37:54.522
And Conrad is
on the road so much

37:54.605 --> 37:56.315
it doesn't matter
where <i> he's</i> based.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.442
{\an1}Well, don't you think that's
kind of a sudden decision?

38:01.278 --> 38:04.073
Oh, it's not gonna be easy
to leave this house, believe me.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.867
All the happy times
that we've had here,

38:06.951 --> 38:09.870
{\an1}and you've been here to share
so many of them with us,

38:09.954 --> 38:13.874
all the big events...
and the milestones.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.378
Anyway, we are gonna have
a whole fresh start.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.755
So come on out
in the backyard

38:19.839 --> 38:22.675
{\an1}because we need
to celebrate.

{\an3}Well, the Scanlons

38:44.613 --> 38:47.074
Um, Sue, can, can I talk
to you for a minute?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.743
Sure.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.745
Listen, I just,
I just wanted to make sure

38:50.828 --> 38:51.746
everything's all right.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.748
Well, why wouldn't it be?

38:53.831 --> 38:55.750

38:55.833 --> 38:56.584
{\an1}with everything you've
been going through,

38:56.667 --> 39:00.254
{\an1}you might need
someone to talk to.

39:00.337 --> 39:01.422
{\an3}Well, what do
you care?

39:01.505 --> 39:03.424
I mean, really?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.553
{\an1}We were just worried.
That's all.

39:07.636 --> 39:08.804

Mr. Meyers.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.767
{\an3}Well, everything's
absolutely fine.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.102
I mean, I have my family.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.563
They're the ones who
really care about me.

when he was in Oklahoma

{\an1}She said that kids just

about...

41:23.689 --> 41:25.900
{\an1}well, that it
has to come

41:25.983 --> 41:26.692
from somewhere.

I'll tell you
what happened.

41:37.036 --> 41:37.745
He was kissing me

41:37.828 --> 41:40.247
and touching me.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.751
I don't know who started it.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.422
It could have been me.

41:49.798 --> 41:53.427
He said it was me.

41:53.510 --> 41:55.721
But then I didn't want
to anymore...

41:57.723 --> 41:59.433
and I pulled away,

41:59.516 --> 42:03.229
but he wouldn't let me.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.772
He wouldn't let me go.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.988
He hurt me.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.786
If Mr. Meyers did this to you,
why'd you take it back?

42:18.869 --> 42:22.206
Because it wasn't Mr. Meyers.

42:22.289 --> 42:24.583
It wasn't him at all.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.295
It was my...

42:29.922 --> 42:32.091
It was my uncle.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.137
It's always been my uncle.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.101

42:42.184 --> 42:44.436
It's just not the
same city it was

42:46.939 --> 42:48.816

42:57.032 --> 42:57.825
Mom, I need
to tell you something.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.956
What?

43:04.748 --> 43:06.667
You were right
after all, Andrea.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.794
Sue didn't make it up,

43:08.877 --> 43:10.838
{\an1}but I'm sure Mrs. Scanlon
never even suspected

43:10.921 --> 43:12.214
{\an1}that her brother
was a child abuser.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.215
Boy, he was smooth.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.842
And now I know why
Scott didn't like the guy.

43:14.925 --> 43:18.512
{\an1}So Sue was afraid he'd start
with the little sister?

43:18.596 --> 43:19.680
{\an1}I mean, how
unbelievably awful.

43:19.763 --> 43:22.725
{\an3}Well, at least Sue
doesn't have to carry

43:22.808 --> 43:25.185
the secret around
by herself anymore

43:25.269 --> 43:26.687
{\an3}and she can start
getting help.

{\an1}DYLAN:
Hey, Bren!

43:27.938 --> 43:29.982

43:31.317 --> 43:32.735

43:32.818 --> 43:34.528
{\an5}Ah, you're not
contagious anymore.
That's right.

43:34.611 --> 43:36.780
So did you, uh,
break the bad news to Donna?

43:36.864 --> 43:38.699
What bad news?

43:38.782 --> 43:40.659
Well, you know how
you were looking forward

43:40.743 --> 43:42.369
to voting in the election?
It's too late.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.871
It is not. It's two weeks away.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.373
No, he means it's too late
to register to vote.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.583
So, I guess you guys are gonna

43:47.666 --> 43:49.251
have to sit this one out
with the rest of us.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.337
But I registered months ago.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.379
You did?

43:52.463 --> 43:53.756
Donna, I never thought
you were so civic-minded.

43:53.839 --> 43:54.882
Are you kidding?
I've been waiting

43:54.965 --> 43:57.343
my whole life
to vote for president.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.469
Way to go, Donna.

43:58.552 --> 44:00.137
So then, you are familiar

44:00.220 --> 44:00.721
with the Coastal Waters
Initiative?

44:00.804 --> 44:03.849
The what?

44:03.932 --> 44:06.018

{\an5}Ha-ha.
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.

44:15.986 --> 44:20.157
{\an3}And don't spend it all
in one place, right?

44:20.240 --> 44:21.784
Nikki, let's go.

44:21.867 --> 44:22.826
Where are you guys off to?

44:22.910 --> 44:23.786
We're gonna check out

44:23.869 --> 44:24.912
{\an1}the new dance club

44:31.001 --> 44:32.878

in a relationship,

44:32.961 --> 44:36.131
you learn important things
about the other person.

44:36.215 --> 44:39.927
For example, I have learned
how dancing makes Nikki feel.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.638
{\an3}And how <i> is</i>
that, Brandon?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.807

44:44.890 --> 44:46.934
{\an3}Bacteria are being
poured into our oceans

44:47.017 --> 44:50.104

to even go close to the water.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.439
{\an3}Just go.
