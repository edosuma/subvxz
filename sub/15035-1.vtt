00:14.915 --> 00:18.829
<i>Once upon</i> a <i>time, there was</i> a <i>girl
named</i> Tessa <i>who had</i> a <i>dream.</i>

01:58.352 --> 02:00.764
<i>This is a story about her reality.</i>

02:01.555 --> 02:04.195
Better hurry, Tessa.
The wicked wltch just arrived.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.430
Tessa! Tessa!

02:08.461 --> 02:09.735
It's all right. I've got this.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.307
Thanks, Joe.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.309
Hey, maybe she gets nicer on vacation.

02:14.635 --> 02:19.709
Holy crappola, Tessa!
You've scuffed my favorite bag!

02:20.207 --> 02:23.120
I'm sorry, Divine.
Uh, this is a lot to carry.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.779
Well, we're all pitching in, Tessa.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.290
- I'll bring the cart. Sir, can I...
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

02:28.515 --> 02:33.191
No! No way am I tipping those vultures.
No! No!

02:34.588 --> 02:38.297
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Be extra careful of Sparkles.

02:38.558 --> 02:41.471
Who's a good dog? Who's a good dog?

02:41.628 --> 02:43.539
- Divine?
- What? Yes?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.301
He's dead.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.809
Not in my heart, Tessa.

02:48.402 --> 02:52.851
Mom! The VIP Princess Package
Includes a costume party,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.747
<i>and Reed West is performing.</i>

02:54.908 --> 02:56.319
Let me see!

02:57.878 --> 02:59.255
Olympia, must you...

02:59.413 --> 03:03.759
Even better, we get our own private
1-minute Reed West encounter.

03:03.917 --> 03:09.162
We're in it for a lot more than 7 minutes,
Athena. We're here to win.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.368
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.173
Oh, a pool! Athena, you need to put
on your bikini and sit by that pool.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.283
- Okay.
- Not you, Olympia.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.283
Oh, my God!

03:29.109 --> 03:30.679
<i>These girls look like pros.</i>

03:30.844 --> 03:34.053
They don't have superstar's blood
coursing through their veins.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.654
Remember, girls,
you're Madonna's third cousins.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.888
Twice removed.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.963
It's not a lot of blood.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.930
Blood is blood.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.866
If I were 10 years younger,
I'd snag that role myself.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.029
Uh-oh.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.539
Janet's here.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.734
Her parents sent her
to music camp In New York.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.573
See you ladies at the VIP lunch.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.276
Can't wait!

03:59.773 --> 04:01.047
Oh, Bianca's here, too.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.517
Lauren!

04:07.681 --> 04:09.319
Divine!

04:09.483 --> 04:12.862
I almost didn't recognize you
with your new face.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.590
Would like the number?
They do lipo as well.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.497
I've forgotten
how dreadfully witty you are.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.698
So we're really excited about this week,
right, Blanca?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.003
Bianca? Sweetheart? Darling?

04:26.166 --> 04:27.907
Bianca. Sweetheart.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.942
Yeah, I'm so excited.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.060
She's a bit of a slug, isn't she?

04:35.175 --> 04:36.848
No, she's been rehearsing.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.451
You've only brought one assistant.
So brave.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.122
Oh, I'm not her assistant.
I'm her stepdaughter.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.398
- Uh, Tessa?
- Yeah?

04:47.554 --> 04:49.966
Could you please go get Sparkles?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.963
- Get Sparkles!
- Yes, right away, Divine.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.365
Thank you.

04:53.527 --> 04:57.202
She's a bit sensitive
about her position In life.

04:58.632 --> 05:03.445
Well, it's been fascinating,
but now I'm bored.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.043
- Tessa, we're on the move!
- Right away!

05:17.384 --> 05:20.490
Oh, Reed! I would sell body parts for you.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.959
Good ones.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.533
Argh, gross! Stop drooling, Olympia.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.799
Argh.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.667
He's definitely worth a kidney.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.833
He looks taken. Who's the girl?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.476
Argh. Harper Halston.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.203
The heiress.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.404
She's so pretty.

05:37.571 --> 05:42.577
Her family owns Royal Lagoons Resorts.
They're holding the audition contest.

05:42.742 --> 05:46.280
You'd know all this if you weren't so busy
greasing up carburetors or whatever.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.926
- You mean my job.
- Not this week, Tessa.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.859
You're here to help Athena and Olympia
focus on one thing.

05:53.019 --> 05:57.024
Dazzling Reed and winning the lead role.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.932
One of you girls is going
to star in the musical,

06:00.093 --> 06:03.802
win that recording contract,
and do me proud.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.377
I named you after goddesses for a reason.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.638
What's the musical?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.975
<i>- Cinderella.
- Cinderella.</i>

06:11.137 --> 06:12.741
Okay, that's kind of ironic.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.947
You, follow me.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.855
Yes, ma'am.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.991
<i>You are going to love
your little room.</i>

06:27.153 --> 06:29.155
- It's right this way.
- Okay, all right.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.237
This is like having your own spa.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.463
Right through here.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.007
Here we go.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.010
Nice and cozy under the stairs.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.178
So I'm Harry Potter.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.516
Exactly.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.017
Now, um, be careful of the gate
because it locks from the outside,

06:54.180 --> 06:57.059
and don't tell anyone you're here, okay?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.629
Oh, I'm gonna get
Into so much trouble for this.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.563
Don't worry.
It's not exactly something I'll instagram.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.492
Yeah.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.161
Thanks.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.551
Olympia, stop that!
That's disgusting. Stop It!

07:29.716 --> 07:32.128
<i>Oh, my God! What are you doing?</i>

07:32.285 --> 07:35.528
<i>Stop it! Don't eat that.
Don't you dare put that In your mouth!</i>

07:35.689 --> 07:39.159
I cannot believe
you humiliate me this way.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.338
Oh, dear.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.698
Oh...

07:45.098 --> 07:46.543
Hello. Hello.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.178
- Not really ready, yeah.
- I think you have this In the bag.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.842
I've never seen
such a dull group of girls.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.075
You remember Janet?

07:53.239 --> 07:56.311
- Oh, yes. Jane. Hello.
- It's Janet.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.511
Oh, you dropped...

07:58.178 --> 07:59.179
Oh.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.617
Whoops.

08:05.685 --> 08:06.959
- Whoops.
- Whoops.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.105
- Tessa. Tessa. Ah!
- Ow!

08:14.427 --> 08:15.428
Tessa.

08:21.534 --> 08:22.672
Ah.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
Ladies...

08:24.137 --> 08:26.310
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Lovely.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.316
She's just a little slow,

08:28.475 --> 08:31.513
but, you know, she smells good,
so we keep her around.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.078
Well, she's learning.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.889
<i>You're so bad!</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:56.480
Hello! Hello! Welcome, VIPs!
You know, by the looks of this crowd,

08:56.636 --> 08:59.776
you'd think VIP stands
for very beautiful person.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.748
I guess then It'd be VBP, but...

09:02.976 --> 09:04.819
<i>Uh, thank you!</i>

09:04.978 --> 09:07.720
Welcome, everyone!
I'm Freddy Marks, the director,

09:07.881 --> 09:11.522
and you all know pop sensation Reed West.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.858
Hi. It's lovely to be here.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.426
I discovered Reed on YouTube,

09:16.589 --> 09:21.129
and now I'm hoping to find a brand new
star right here In this very room.

09:21.294 --> 09:25.765
Harper sang a romantic duet with Reed.
Will you be next?

09:25.932 --> 09:28.845
Now, auditions will be held
tomorrow morning,

09:29.002 --> 09:32.575
and the show will premiere on
the very last night of your VIP stay.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.652
So this is gonna be a fast-paced,
exciting adventure

09:35.809 --> 09:40.280
for all those who make the cast,
especially one very lucky young lady.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.958
And the best part,

09:42.115 --> 09:45.392
if our Cinderella impresses
the Slick Tracks record execs,

09:45.552 --> 09:47.429
she'll be signed on the spot.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.688
Yeah, how about that?

09:49.789 --> 09:53.134
<i>All right, so good luck, everybody,
and we?! see you all In the morning.</i>

09:53.293 --> 09:54.670
<i>- Thank you.
- Cheers.</i>

09:59.632 --> 10:01.202
Earth to Tessa.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.544
Oh. Mom, help. Help!

10:19.586 --> 10:21.293
Mom, I'm drowning.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.592
I'm drowning.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.591
<i>- Oh!
- Help.</i>

10:25.492 --> 10:26.532
Sorry. Give me one second.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.764
Grab this.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.712
<i>She's so funny when she's drowning.</i>

10:37.637 --> 10:38.945
<i>R's so great.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:49.983
Gently, Tessa.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.995
Can you do my face?

11:06.432 --> 11:08.070
Am I getting it all?

11:08.234 --> 11:10.578
Hmm, yeah, just...
I think you missed a spot just right...

11:10.737 --> 11:12.148
- There?
- Yeah, right there.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.777
- Is that it?
- Oh, yeah.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.460
We wouldn't want you to get sunburned.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.119
- Okay.
- Good, you can go now.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.415
Okay.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.551
Spritz.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.121
Spritz.

11:27.754 --> 11:28.824
Spritz.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.233
Great song, huh?

12:07.927 --> 12:09.736
Yes, it's beautiful.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.876
Oh, I'm Georgie, by the way.
I'm the makeup artist for the show.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.782
Uh, I'm Tessa,
currently an indentured servant.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.418
But you sing, too.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.522
I heard you humming.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.961
No...

12:33.486 --> 12:38.196
I mean, yeah, I love music and dance,
but maybe In another life.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.598
Too bad we only get one.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.636
Um...

12:50.103 --> 12:52.105
It was nice to meet you.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.966
<i>- All</i> right, here we go.
- All right.

13:10.990 --> 13:11.991
Hey.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.571
Is that a 500cc twin? 1950, right?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.168
Yeah, if you say so. Can you just...

13:17.297 --> 13:19.903
Yeah, we're stage hands,
not really bike people.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.739
Turn. Turn right. Turn.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.641
- Come on.
- Wait.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.723
<i>- Here we go.
- All right, we got this.</i>

13:28.441 --> 13:29.545
Wow.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.120
Wow, that's one of Lambini's very first
real sporting V-Twin engines.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.156
She's... She's beautiful.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.991
You have any idea why
one of these sporting things won't start?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.524
You know what? I'd love to figure it out.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.561
Hey, can I borrow those?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.071
My Pants?

13:49.228 --> 13:50.468
Yeah, your overalls.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.302
- Yeah. I mean, yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.672
- Okay.
- Yeah?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.182
Start her up.

14:03.743 --> 14:04.744
There we go.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.015
Nice work, Tessa.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.852
Oh, they got the bike started.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.188
<i>I wish I was there.
You could give me</i> a <i>ride.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:12.828
<i>Yeah, the alignment was just off.</i>

14:12.852 --> 14:15.297
The two cylinders kind of needed to run
as one, but It's all good now.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.062
All right, brilliant. Thanks, mate.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.525
"Mate."

14:19.692 --> 14:24.937
<i>Reedsiboo, can I finish my story?
I have lunch with Kim In Paris.</i>

14:25.164 --> 14:26.165
Yeah, sure, sure.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.052
Guys, thanks so much.
Freddy will cover you.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.504
Okay. Just...

14:32.372 --> 14:34.079
No. Um...

14:34.474 --> 14:36.545
I've got to go, guys,
but I'll see you later.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.087
- Yeah.
- Let me know how the bike goes, okay?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.988
- Than ks.
- Than ks. Yeah.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.486
"Some days, I've worked so hard,

14:44.984 --> 14:48.454
"my body aches like that of an old woman.

14:49.021 --> 14:53.800
"My face is covered in cinders.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.233
"My feet..."

14:56.396 --> 14:58.876
Hey, Picasso,
can you color inside the lines'?

14:59.031 --> 15:01.068
Could you hold still?

15:01.367 --> 15:02.402
Me next!

15:03.236 --> 15:07.912
All right, Sparkles, I need your opinion
on a very Important subject.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.047
What do you think?

15:10.510 --> 15:16.222
Candy Yum-Yum or Lady Danger?

15:19.419 --> 15:23.663
You rascal, you!
All right, Lady Danger It ls.

15:28.127 --> 15:32.507
Tessa, save Sparkles!
Sparkles is drowning!

15:32.665 --> 15:35.043
He's drowning! He's drowning!

15:36.936 --> 15:41.248
Don't use too much product, Tessa.
Fluffy but not pretentious.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.020
Hi. Can I...

15:50.917 --> 15:52.692
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.635
Hey, Tessa, come on over.

16:00.827 --> 16:01.828
Hey.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.355
- Eddie.
- Let me get this for you.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.933
Hey, guys... Thank you very much.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.241
Hi.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.212

Hey.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.430
Shh.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.510
My God, they're amazing!

16:43.135 --> 16:44.136
Hey.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.579
Biggest secret here, the best talent
makes beds and hauls trash.

16:50.776 --> 16:51.777
Wow.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.296
Come on, Tessa. Let's go dance. Come on.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.661
- What?
- Go. Go!

17:10.930 --> 17:12.068
Okay.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.583
That was sick!

17:30.750 --> 17:32.794
That's crazy, girl. Come on.
Show us some more moves.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.320
- What?
- Come on! Show us your moves!

17:34.487 --> 17:35.761
Now it's your turn, Georgie.

19:38.644 --> 19:42.148
Get back to work. Come on. Move. Move!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.085
Why are you not auditioning
for the musical?

19:46.485 --> 19:50.934
Thanks, Georgie, but my stepmother
would never, ever allow me to audition.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.903
That's it.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.832
- What?
- Audition In disguise.

19:56.762 --> 20:01.802
Okay, I'm sure you're great with makeup
and your brushes and stuff, but I doubt...

20:06.105 --> 20:07.209
Pout for me.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.681
I'm not so sure about this.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.752
Shush, shush, and shush.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.514
Yeah, let's begin.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.897
Bull's eye.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.946
Oh, hey, Georgie, who's your friend?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.691
- You know me. I'm...
- She's a guest, Eddie.

20:49.315 --> 20:53.024
She's a guest. You need anything,
you just... You let us know.

20:55.988 --> 21:00.960
I can sweep. Sweep your room.
We sweep... We sweep rooms. We...

21:01.427 --> 21:04.135
He didn't recognize me,
and I've worn his coveralls before.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.674
Okay, don't know what that means,
but I feel vindicated.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.368
Now you have to audition.

21:08.534 --> 21:12.710
Georgie, look, your makeup brushes
are like magic wands, but I can't do this.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.011
My family will
recognize my voice Immediately.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.711
Then disguise it. Here we are.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.983
It's not like, "I'm Olympia!"

21:22.982 --> 21:27.021
It's like,
"I'm Olympia. I'm here. I'm yours."

21:28.220 --> 21:29.358
Okay, I'm going-

21:30.823 --> 21:32.700
- I'm gonna do this.
- Okay, go.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.730
Okay, I'm gonna go.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.338
- Tess, go.
- Okay.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.201
<i>You're not listening to me.</i>

21:40.666 --> 21:43.738
Wow, Janet, you look great,
and don't worry.

21:43.969 --> 21:48.042
No one will even notice that huge vein
bulging out of your forehead.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.152
Young lady.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.989
Are you a VIP guest?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.399
I didn't see you at the brunch.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.460
Um...

22:09.562 --> 22:11.906
The trolley broke.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.770
The trolley?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.743
Yes, it's a bloody shame.
The trolley broke.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.350
I know you from somewhere.

22:23.108 --> 22:27.921
No, um, I don't think so.

22:29.515 --> 22:34.089
The Niedermeyer Bar Mitzvah?
Did we Hava Nagila?

22:34.620 --> 22:37.157
I don't think I had that pleasure, ma'am.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.769
- Oh, you didn't have that pleasure.
- No.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.867
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.040
The National Dog Show in Philly?

22:48.734 --> 22:51.647
Afraid not. I'm a cat person.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.222
- You even smell familiar.
- It's vanilla!

23:01.080 --> 23:04.186
It's my deodorant.
It's all the rage In London, England.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.192
Very interesting.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.462
- All right.
- Yes.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.466
I've got my eyes on you.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.628
Oh, that won't be necessary. It's okay.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.301
Cheers!

23:20.900 --> 23:23.244
God save the Queen

23:23.402 --> 23:24.676
in London,

23:25.537 --> 23:26.538
where I'm from.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.341
<i>Whatever. All right, Olympia...</i>

23:29.508 --> 23:30.987
Oh, that was close.

23:57.303 --> 23:58.907
She has a big finish.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.888
Okay, thank you, dear.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.051

25:51.250 --> 25:52.593

26:17.843 --> 26:18.947
Okay. Go ahead.

26:19.678 --> 26:20.679

Stuck <i>on</i> the Outside for me?

26:45.204 --> 26:46.512
Thank you.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.396
Well, it's pretty average.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.867
What's your name?

28:19.231 --> 28:20.232
Uh...

28:20.966 --> 28:22.741

28:22.901 --> 28:23.902

28:24.136 --> 28:26.412
- Ironic. Hmm.
- Just a bit.

28:27.673 --> 28:30.051
I like your top.
I've got a pair of boxers like those.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.246
Go London. Patriotic.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.926
Whereabouts are you from?
I can't quite find your accent.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.861
You can't? It's odd.

28:41.220 --> 28:46.169
I'm from... It's a small farming village.
It's just north of London. It's called...

28:47.593 --> 28:49.633
It's called Yorkshirer Puddingshire.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.966
- Yorkshire Puddingshire?
- Yorkshirer.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.837
- Yorkshirer Puddingshire.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.133
Yes.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.177
Okay. Oh, is that near...

28:57.736 --> 28:58.737
Uh-huh.

28:59.338 --> 29:04.048
It's right near Hogwartshire.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.650
Hogwartshire, Freddy. I knew it.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.553
Yeah. Okay.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.583
Well, Yorkshire Puddingshire,
let's see If you can move.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.723
- You want me to dance?
- Yeah, I'd love you to dance.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.897
- Are you ready?
- For what?

30:29.127 --> 30:30.128
Whoa!

30:31.863 --> 30:34.139
- Can you salsa?
- Oh, not at all.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.840
- Catch me.
- Catch you?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.452
Who the hell is she?

30:51.616 --> 30:53.960
- It's hard to say.
- Why does she get to dance?

30:54.119 --> 30:58.431
"Hard to say." She's an impostor.
She wasn't even at the kick-off brunch.

30:58.590 --> 30:59.660
She's here now.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.232
- I'm so sorry. I have to go.
- What?

31:02.994 --> 31:04.234
No, wait. You're amazing. Wait.

31:04.262 --> 31:08.870
Arrest that girl! She's impersonating
a VIP! Arrest that girl!

31:09.034 --> 31:12.174
Grab her! Don't let her get away!
Don't let her get away!

31:13.638 --> 31:15.276
Stop it! Stop it!

31:16.241 --> 31:17.242
Stop that!

31:22.848 --> 31:25.385
Well, I guess
the fairy tale gods have spoken.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.696
<i>The way you two danced together!</i>

31:29.287 --> 31:32.200
- It was like a fairy tale.
- I bet he's gonna pick you.

31:36.428 --> 31:40.069
It doesn't matter. You saw Divine.
She'd get me disqualified In a heartbeat.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.906
We'll come up with a fake name,
and It'll all work out.

31:43.068 --> 31:46.208
Georgie, I'm really sorry.

31:46.371 --> 31:49.682
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me...

31:53.845 --> 31:56.849
But I think it's time for me
to get back to my real life.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.961
But thank you.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.312
Sit up straight. Sit up straight.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.514
All right, I'd just like to start off
by saying

32:19.538 --> 32:23.076
thank you very much to everyone here
for auditioning today.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.882
<i>We'll be posting a cast list soon
of the secondary roles,</i>

32:28.847 --> 32:30.326
but I've found my Cinderella.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.191
Now I just need to actually find her.

32:35.654 --> 32:39.067
The mystery Cinderella, she lost
her dance shoe today at the audition.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.829
<i>It's a very special shoe.</i>

32:43.528 --> 32:45.838
Uh, if you're the owner
of that matching shoe,

32:45.997 --> 32:48.534
then please come forward
by midnight tomorrow.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.207
And the role is yours.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.997

33:11.156 --> 33:12.965
- This one?
- I'm not sure.

33:13.124 --> 33:17.402
Think, Olympia. Round up every last
little brain cell that's In there.

33:17.562 --> 33:18.563
Good morning.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.874

33:24.569 --> 33:26.947
Yes, that's the shoe flower.
That's the one.

33:27.172 --> 33:31.780
Oh, Tessa, you need to paint that flower
on this shoe.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.353
Um...

33:34.346 --> 33:36.306
There's no point
because If he has the matching...

33:36.448 --> 33:39.793
Nobody else knows
about the hand-painted flower.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.591
He has to pick somebody by midnight.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.995
- Go! Go! Go!
- Okay.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.397
- Go! Go! Go!

33:49.194 --> 33:52.641
Guess what? Get Loose

33:52.931 --> 33:53.932
Wow, that was fast.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.899
See? I told you that to work with Harper
would be gold for your career.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.074
It's Reed!

34:00.805 --> 34:02.079
If anybody is interested,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.777
the supporting cast list
has just been posted backstage.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.347
Come on, let's go.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.620
Okay, I tried, but I just really
don't think this is gonna work. It's...

34:13.184 --> 34:14.458
What happened? Did someone die?

34:14.619 --> 34:17.600
Worse. Bianca got cast as fairy godmother.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.458
Janet is the evil stepmother,
and all we get to play ls

34:20.625 --> 34:22.900
- the ugly stepsisters.
- Ugly stepsisters.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.699
How could they possibly think
that we should play

34:25.864 --> 34:29.175
those mean, horrible, self-absorbed girls!

34:30.034 --> 34:32.743
Gosh, it boggles the imagination,
doesn't It?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.178
Finally.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.452
What, did you paint it with your toes?

34:38.143 --> 34:42.284
As usual, I'll take care of things,
right, girls?

34:44.449 --> 34:47.190
Uh, hello? Doorbell.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.731
<i>Olympia, sit up straight.</i>

34:53.992 --> 34:55.596
Athena, stop looking so depressed.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.199
It's from Reed West.

35:08.740 --> 35:12.051
"Reed West requests the company of..."

35:13.678 --> 35:16.591
No!

35:16.748 --> 35:17.818
What is it? What's wrong?

35:18.583 --> 35:22.190
You! Why does he want to see you?

35:23.154 --> 35:24.155
What?

35:24.322 --> 35:29.362
I saw you at Reed's announcement,
making gooey eyes at him.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.834
No, that's...

35:32.697 --> 35:35.007
You plucked your eyebrows for him,
didn't you?

35:35.166 --> 35:39.114
No, I didn't. I didn't. It's just
a big misunderstanding. It's just...

35:39.270 --> 35:42.717
Well, we'll find out, shall we?

35:42.874 --> 35:43.875
Come with me.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.290
Girls! Girls, we're leaving.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.787
"I don't want to go!"

35:50.949 --> 35:53.294
We're gonna get to the bottom of this
right now, little missy,

35:53.318 --> 35:55.457
and if you screwed things up
for my girls, I...

35:55.620 --> 35:57.531
<i>- Girls, try to keep up!
- That's R.</i>

35:57.689 --> 36:02.104
Reed? Reed West?
I have Tessa here. You wanted to see her?

36:02.293 --> 36:03.294
Wait.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.964
Oh, yes, been trying to track you down.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.299
You have?

36:07.465 --> 36:11.174
Why would you want to see her?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.838
- Why, I just need your help.
- You do?

36:14.472 --> 36:16.679
- The show kind of depends on it.
- It does'?

36:16.841 --> 36:17.842
Yeah.

36:19.177 --> 36:23.592
What is... The mechanic said you were
the one who got Lt started yesterday.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.561
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.722
I'm sorry for mistaking you for a dude.
It's my bad.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.335
It's okay.
I'm just glad every/thing's all cleared up.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.660
Right. Well, there's...

36:34.826 --> 36:37.329
Yeah, there's a little clunking noise
coming from the...

36:37.529 --> 36:38.530
Uh...

36:38.963 --> 36:39.964
From the motorcycle.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.201
- From the bike?
- Yeah.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.326
- Um, could you describe the clunking?
- Like a...

36:45.637 --> 36:47.583
Okay, is it like a fast...

36:47.972 --> 36:49.052
Like a...

36:49.140 --> 36:51.916
Kind of. Well, it starts off...
It starts off like It's building,

36:52.077 --> 36:54.477
- so it's a bit more...
- Okay, like a...

36:55.113 --> 36:56.786
No, it's more like a...

37:00.819 --> 37:02.563
- Like a train.
- I don't know what trains you've heard.

37:02.587 --> 37:05.397
Yes, it cuts out,
and If I try and do It again, It goes...

37:08.293 --> 37:09.431
Yeah, I think I know it.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.503
Well, we just need
to get It fixed, If we can.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.703
Otherwise, Cinderella
won't have a pumpkin carriage.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.200
I can try.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.141
Wait, wait, wait.

37:17.569 --> 37:23.520
If I let my darling Tessa do this for you,
you have to do something for me.

37:23.708 --> 37:27.781
You have to let
my talented daughters audition again.

37:28.279 --> 37:30.520
They had an eensy problem the first time.

37:31.583 --> 37:37.033
By the way,
prepare to have your mind blown.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.593
Uh...

37:42.727 --> 37:43.762
Yeah, deal.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.107
Come on, girls, we have to practice.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.542
- Bye, Reed.
- Bye.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.705
Olympia!

37:53.872 --> 37:56.284
Freddy, can we set Tessa up
In the prop room, please?

38:01.079 --> 38:03.685
It's not bad as it looks. I swear.

38:04.349 --> 38:07.228
Well, this is nothing compared
to the hot mess I just saw.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.626
I'm sure.
I kind of overheard a little bit.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.788
Okay, so these are the parts
that I need you to get

38:11.823 --> 38:14.235
so that I can fix your pumpkin carriage.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.075
Where did you learn to do all this?

38:23.434 --> 38:25.107
Um, my dad was a race car driver.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.524
Yeah, he had his own repair shop,

38:27.572 --> 38:30.815
so I was basically working on cars
before I could walk.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.487
Is your dad still racing cars now?

38:36.881 --> 38:39.555
I hope so. In heaven.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.027
Could you pass me the 9/16 spanner?

38:47.525 --> 38:49.562
- No.
- Oh, the wrench.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.029
Oh...

38:52.163 --> 38:55.110
- No, I don't know what that one...
- The small silver thing...

38:55.266 --> 38:57.478
- This one? Small silver thingy.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right there.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.981
- Should've just said that.
- Thanks.

39:01.806 --> 39:05.447
So did your dad let
baby Tessa drive race cars, too?

39:05.743 --> 39:06.744
No.

39:07.312 --> 39:10.020
No, I had to wait
till I was about five for that.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.252
All right, wise to wait. Oh.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.358
<i>- Hi.
- You did it, babel</i>

39:18.723 --> 39:22.261
<i>The show's sold out. The resort, too.
Dad's thrilled.</i>

39:22.427 --> 39:23.531
Oh, that's great.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.406
<i>Freddy says
you haven't cast Cinderella yet?</i>

39:27.866 --> 39:31.404
No, not yet, but there's someone
we're hoping is gonna accept It.

39:31.936 --> 39:36.908
<i>Then make it happen, hot stuff.
Anyway, got to fly.</i>

39:39.377 --> 39:42.517
- Sorry. It's a lot going on.
- It's okay.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.126
I'm in trouble if this girl doesn't show.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.930
You really think
your mystery girl is that good?

39:48.052 --> 39:52.933
Oh, definitely, but Royal Resorts want us
to complete casting today.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.463
Yeah, and if mystery girl
doesn't come forward,

39:55.627 --> 39:56.987
then we have to pick someone else.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.380
I like spending time with you.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.331
I'd really like it
If you'd meet me tomorrow,

40:09.007 --> 40:13.285
and maybe, well,
you'd let me hold your spanner.

40:18.383 --> 40:23.128
Oh, my God! I thought he was gonna be,
like, all abs and attitude,

40:23.288 --> 40:27.327
but he's so sweet.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.332
Someone's crushing hard.

40:29.494 --> 40:32.441
Oh, please!
He's dating a gorgeous celebrity heiress.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.577
Who can't possibly hold a candle to you.

40:34.732 --> 40:37.008
She doesn't have to.
She has people for that.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.850
It's okay. It's just the way things are.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.382
Yeah, I wish...

40:43.875 --> 40:44.979
What?

40:49.314 --> 40:52.659
Your dad,
he made his dreams come true, right'?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.059
Yeah.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.358
Wouldn't he want you to do the same?

40:58.890 --> 41:02.497
<i>I just hate to see
perfectly good dreams go to waste.</i>

41:14.806 --> 41:19.016
<i>Okay, Dad, I'll be brave.</i>

41:33.858 --> 41:34.859
Come on.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.680
<i>How much longer is this going to take?</i>

41:39.397 --> 41:41.308
- We got to get moving.
- I don't know.

41:41.466 --> 41:44.174
- Where's the girl with the shoe?
- I don't know.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.984
Look, she's not coming.
Can we just pick someone?

41:59.884 --> 42:02.956
No, it's not midnight yet.
Just a few more minutes.

42:07.592 --> 42:10.471
Stop it. Stop it!

42:11.362 --> 42:12.670
Stop it.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.440
So annoying.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.370
Unbelievable.

42:20.772 --> 42:24.845
Reed, if we don't pick someone,
they'll cancel my show. Please?

42:27.712 --> 42:28.850
Fine.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.170
Am I too late?

42:37.789 --> 42:39.393
- That's her, right?
- Yeah.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.920
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:05.650 --> 43:08.688
Cherry blossoms
were me mum's favorite flowers.

43:11.489 --> 43:12.593
Why did you run?

43:13.458 --> 43:15.563
I wasn't sure
I should've auditioned at all.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.671
But you've changed your mind, right?
You'll be my Cinderella?

43:24.335 --> 43:25.336
Yes.

43:26.070 --> 43:30.382
Hold on a second!
Walt one minute!

43:30.541 --> 43:33.784
Hold on! Hold on! I have something to say!

43:33.945 --> 43:39.327
This girl, I bet she's not even
a legitimate guest.

43:39.484 --> 43:41.225
What? That's absurd.

43:41.719 --> 43:42.823
Ah! "Absurd!"

43:42.987 --> 43:45.160
Of course I'm probably a guest.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.495
Well, what's your name?

43:47.058 --> 43:49.004
- My name?
- Yes.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.897
Right, because everyone...
Everyone has a name, right'?

43:53.064 --> 43:54.543
Spit it out.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.178
Mmm-hmm. Um...

44:00.505 --> 44:06.478
The... See, the name
that my mother gave me was...

44:06.711 --> 44:08.122
Bella!

44:08.379 --> 44:09.824
Bella!

44:09.981 --> 44:11.824
- Bella Snow!
- Bella Buckingham.

44:12.550 --> 44:14.052
- Bella Buckingham?
- Bella Snow!

44:14.886 --> 44:17.127
It's Bella Buckingham Snow.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.232
Bella Snow for short.

44:21.192 --> 44:25.038
It's good to see you.
I was just at your mom's castle...

44:25.196 --> 44:27.904
In Yorkshire Puddingshire. How lovely.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.705
Yup, Bella Snow, VIP. She's legit.

44:36.474 --> 44:38.010
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay, aâ€œ fight.</i>

44:40.077 --> 44:41.784
I'm on to you.

44:42.213 --> 44:46.662
You and your silly sneakers
had better watch your step.

44:49.820 --> 44:52.198
Okay, then. Read this.
Check out the links.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.303
Learn the routines.
Start rehearsal In the morning.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.571
All right.

44:59.997 --> 45:03.206
No! No carbs for you.
You're getting too fat.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.744
Here's the tablet you requested.

45:04.902 --> 45:07.439
Finally. Sit down.
I want you to Google something.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.812
- Okay, what do you want me to Google?
- Google Bella Snow.

45:11.175 --> 45:12.950
- Snow.
- Bella Snow.

45:13.110 --> 45:15.215
Snow, like the stuff
that falls from the sky.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.859
B-E-L...
Just give that to me. Let me do it.

45:18.015 --> 45:20.135
<i>- You're so slow.
- You do it. She's too slow.</i>

45:21.385 --> 45:22.386
Okay.

45:23.354 --> 45:28.167
Okay, here's one.
"Bella Snow, uh, dentist In New Jersey."

45:28.726 --> 45:31.536
That's not her.
That girl is as brainless as they come.

45:31.696 --> 45:37.408
Okay, I found a British Bella Snow
who died 100 years ago.

45:37.768 --> 45:39.543
- Aw!
- This is pointless. She doesn't exist.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.048
I knew it! She's an impostor.

45:42.206 --> 45:46.746
I want you to follow her after rehearsal
and find out who she ls.

45:47.678 --> 45:48.782
Me?

45:48.946 --> 45:50.425
- Oh, I'll go, too.
- Can I go?

45:56.554 --> 45:59.433
I'm gonna go make sure the chef
has your suggestions for dinner, okay?

45:59.590 --> 46:02.628
All right, and, you know, I want
the spritzing station by the cabana today.

46:02.793 --> 46:05.000
- Got it.
- I love to be spritzed.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.690
Just go with what you're feeling
at the time.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.608
- Don't decide beforehand.
- All right.

46:09.767 --> 46:13.078
Just let it be whatever you're feeling
In the moment, okay?

46:13.237 --> 46:14.341
<i>- Yeah.
- Cool.</i>

46:14.505 --> 46:17.008
<i>- Oh, good, you're here. Okay.
- HI.</i>

46:17.174 --> 46:19.745
So we want to do
Cinderella's opening song.

46:19.910 --> 46:21.446
You're ready, right?

46:21.612 --> 46:25.025
Okay, great!
Let's give her some space, folks!

46:25.182 --> 46:28.686
Right, this song's about a girl who
lives a difficult life filled with loss,

46:28.853 --> 46:31.094
who struggles to find
the courage to go after her dreams.

46:31.255 --> 46:33.292
Try and imagine
what that might be like, okay?

46:33.958 --> 46:35.130
I can try.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.169
Okay, places everybody.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.608
We definitely found our girl.

48:26.837 --> 48:27.941
Okay.

48:28.839 --> 48:30.250
Seventeen.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.978
Arms up. up, up, up.

48:32.143 --> 48:33.884
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Mmm.

48:34.278 --> 48:37.088
Oh, you've got a waist
like a little hummingbird.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.852
- Okay.
- Cheers.

48:46.090 --> 48:47.091
Bella.

48:48.159 --> 48:49.229
Georgie.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.340
Look at you, all princessy.

48:56.534 --> 49:00.482
<i>For the first time,
I feel like maybe I can do this,</i>

49:01.138 --> 49:02.310
<i>like for real.</i>

49:02.606 --> 49:03.676
Hello.

49:06.043 --> 49:08.649
Argh! My God. My stepsisters
are waiting to follow me outside.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.417
Go out the back. They won't expect it.

49:10.581 --> 49:11.685
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

49:11.849 --> 49:13.453
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.960
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:23.661 --> 49:24.799
Where is she?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.474
Come on.

49:47.017 --> 49:49.657
Okay, you go that way.

50:18.415 --> 50:19.587
Got you!

50:20.518 --> 50:21.519
Oops.

50:23.087 --> 50:24.088
Who are you?

50:29.460 --> 50:30.837
- Got you!
- Olympia!

50:32.663 --> 50:36.839
- Oh, it's such a delight to see you here.
- It is'?

50:37.001 --> 50:41.609
Could you be so kind as to pass me
that suntan lotion over there, dear?

50:41.772 --> 50:43.718
We Brits, we just crisp so easily.

50:49.313 --> 50:50.986
Oh, do you mind? I can't reach.

50:52.449 --> 50:53.621
Thank you.

50:54.285 --> 50:57.391
So, tell me, Olympia, was it hard
to get all those scarves In your mouth?

50:57.555 --> 51:00.832
- Oh, I had to train my cheeks for weeks.
- Did you?

51:01.559 --> 51:03.766
- Do you want to see?
- Sure.

51:09.533 --> 51:11.604
That's a lot of grapes.

51:12.803 --> 51:16.012
Do you know what would be lovely?
Some lemonade.

51:16.173 --> 51:17.618
- Hmm and snacks.
- Yes, and snacks.

51:17.775 --> 51:19.482
- I can get them.
- Oh, you could?

51:19.877 --> 51:21.788
- That's absolutely perfect.
- Mmm-hmm. Okay.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.284
Thank you. I'll be just right here
waiting. Right here. Won't move.

51:27.384 --> 51:29.295
She's so nice and smart.

51:30.487 --> 51:33.331
But then she disappeared
before I could give her her snacks.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.938
You got played, Olympia.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.937
You're just jealous because
Bella's head is prettier than yours.

51:40.664 --> 51:41.938
Where have you been?

51:42.099 --> 51:43.899
I was just picking up
the dresses you ordered.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.212
Are these for the costume ball?

51:49.139 --> 51:51.085
We're going as Cinderellas.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.376
<i>'Lee-haw.</i>

51:53.210 --> 51:54.382
Creative.

51:55.846 --> 51:59.316
Abracadabra!
Just... That's what a magician says.

52:00.551 --> 52:02.827
So this is your wand.
It's very simple to use.

52:02.987 --> 52:04.989
I'll just demonstrate for you.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.859
Ah, Gino, could you step
Into Cinderella's position, please?

52:08.025 --> 52:09.026
Yeah.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.901
So all you do is... Twirl.

52:15.933 --> 52:18.470
See? It's so easy.
Just a flick of the wrist.

52:19.136 --> 52:23.846
Here. Go ahead, uh, get a feel for it,
and let me know If you have any questions.

52:24.008 --> 52:25.248
Sorry.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.146
This is ridiculous.

52:29.313 --> 52:32.074
What were you thinking getting
Blanca and the stepsisters In the show?

52:32.716 --> 52:34.992
Olympia, stop it! Gross!

52:35.486 --> 52:36.726
We have no choice, all right?

52:36.887 --> 52:38.127
The VIP Package guarantees them

52:38.255 --> 52:39.563
supporting roles.

52:41.025 --> 52:42.766
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.969
I can get a great performance
out of anybody.

52:45.129 --> 52:47.632
These wings are so heavy.

52:48.732 --> 52:50.609
She's gonna be great.

52:53.270 --> 52:54.874
<i>So it's four beats in the hips.</i>

52:57.007 --> 52:58.207
All right?

52:58.842 --> 53:00.913
- Hello.
- Oh, Bella is here,

53:01.078 --> 53:03.080
so let's rehearse
the shoe-fitting scene, please.

53:03.247 --> 53:04.248
No.

53:04.415 --> 53:06.691
Yes, that's what we're gonna do.

53:07.217 --> 53:09.629
Freddy, can you run the show
without me for a little bit?

53:09.787 --> 53:10.930
What? Why? Where are you going?

53:10.954 --> 53:14.265
To fix Cinderella's pumpkin carriage.
Can't do the show without It, right?

53:14.692 --> 53:15.693
Ah...

53:16.760 --> 53:18.262
Guess I'll stand in.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.874
If Tessa is not there,
he'll think she's a flake or doesn't care.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.946
You can't be in two places at once.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.813
Meet me in makeup
with coveralls and a cap, okay?

53:31.975 --> 53:33.181
Okay.

53:34.778 --> 53:36.289
Tess, how are you going to pull this off?

53:36.313 --> 53:39.692
Great question. I think I'm going to get
Reed started, then tell him I have to go,

53:39.850 --> 53:41.594
and then I'll just meet you
back here with the Bella wig.

53:41.618 --> 53:44.827
You work your magic again
with your magic makeup hands.

53:44.988 --> 53:45.989
- Okay.
- Other shoe.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.458
Thanks.

53:47.991 --> 53:49.334
Okay. Ah...

53:49.660 --> 53:51.105
wig. okay-

53:51.295 --> 53:53.576
- You need a brush?
- No, It's okay. I don't need a brush.

53:53.731 --> 53:54.732
Okay.

53:55.632 --> 53:56.633
Time to go.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.035
Okay.

53:58.435 --> 53:59.436
Ew, ew!

53:59.803 --> 54:00.804
Okay. Cap.

54:00.971 --> 54:02.143
- Here. Here you go.
- Okay.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.576
Good? Okay. Bye-bye.

54:06.643 --> 54:07.644
Go! Go!

54:07.811 --> 54:08.983
<i>â€œOkay
- Go!</i>

54:13.217 --> 54:14.787
Oh, thank God. I thought you forgot.

54:14.952 --> 54:18.195
No, it just takes a little time
to look this hot.

54:18.355 --> 54:19.390
Yeah?

54:20.524 --> 54:21.594
Sorry.

54:22.059 --> 54:24.139
I got those parts that you asked for.
I don't know...

54:24.194 --> 54:26.435
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

54:26.730 --> 54:28.767
- That or Legos.
- Um...

54:29.166 --> 54:31.703
Wow, I'm surprised
you got these parts so quickly.

54:31.869 --> 54:33.849
Yeah, well, the perks of being a pop star.

54:34.004 --> 54:35.347
Must be nice.

54:35.906 --> 54:36.907
Not really.

54:37.341 --> 54:39.452
But nobody should have to listen
to pop star problems.

54:39.476 --> 54:42.355
Like getting everything you could want,
Including awesome bike parts?

54:42.513 --> 54:44.254
Yeah. Not exactly.

54:45.516 --> 54:49.896
Or like not being able
to follow your heart, maybe?

54:53.090 --> 54:54.091
Ah...

54:54.825 --> 54:57.704
I heard those songs
that you wrote for the musical.

54:58.328 --> 55:00.774
They're really good. Beautiful.

55:03.433 --> 55:04.571
Really?

55:06.069 --> 55:08.071
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

55:10.641 --> 55:11.984
That's the real you, right?

55:13.177 --> 55:14.954
Freddy just thinks
I need to stick to my brand

55:14.978 --> 55:19.484
until my career reaches the next level.
Then I can do whatever I want.

55:20.684 --> 55:21.788
Freddy could be wrong.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.762
Yeah, it's just that he's been right
about everything else.

55:26.723 --> 55:29.260
Hmm, like I said, pop star problems.

55:29.793 --> 55:31.898
Well, they're safe with me.

55:33.130 --> 55:34.666
Yeah, I believe they are.

55:37.267 --> 55:38.905
- Yeah, you're gonna need that.
- Yeah.

55:47.477 --> 55:49.582
- Come on.
- Uh, Oh...

55:49.980 --> 55:52.221
Just... Will you just tighten
these bolts really quick,

55:52.382 --> 55:56.455
and finish putting on the belts,
and I will be...

55:56.954 --> 55:58.834
I'll be right back.
I've just got to check on...

55:58.889 --> 56:01.426
Are you gonna come back, though?
I can't do this without you.

56:01.592 --> 56:04.004
Yes, of course. I'll be back.

56:20.577 --> 56:23.786
Bella!
You're supposed to make a noise there.

56:28.352 --> 56:30.730
Am I too late to try on the slipper?

56:30.888 --> 56:34.631
Every maiden in the land
is granted the opportunity.

56:34.958 --> 56:36.596
Could that be her?

56:36.793 --> 56:37.794
Ow!

56:40.264 --> 56:41.800
Could that be her?

56:41.965 --> 56:45.503
The lass that I have waited
my whole life for?

56:45.669 --> 56:47.706
Come! Come!

56:47.871 --> 56:50.852
Please, present your foot.

56:54.912 --> 56:56.186
What?

56:56.580 --> 56:58.924
Your mole switched cheeks.

57:02.352 --> 57:04.491
It happens to all the Snow women.

57:04.655 --> 57:06.695
We just
don't like to talk about It.

57:07.391 --> 57:08.563
Okay.

57:08.825 --> 57:09.826
Uh...

57:10.093 --> 57:13.438
Okay, yeah.
Bring your foot up. Good. And...

57:14.031 --> 57:15.635
A perfect fit!

57:16.133 --> 57:21.446
Okay, and now we get up.
We come up and get ready for the spin.

57:22.339 --> 57:28.312
I have found you, my princess,
and you shall never wear rags again.

57:30.547 --> 57:32.823
Come. Come! Come on!

57:38.121 --> 57:43.002
Never fear. Your fairy godmother is here.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.731
Let others see you as I do.

57:48.298 --> 57:49.436
Twirl.

57:52.135 --> 57:53.341
- Twirl.
- Come on.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.263
- Flick the wrist like I showed you.
- Twirl!

58:01.545 --> 58:02.546
Ahhh.

58:05.549 --> 58:07.927
For crying out loud, people...

58:08.085 --> 58:11.794
Fix this, please!
Now, let's take It from the top.

58:12.689 --> 58:13.963
Bella?

58:16.193 --> 58:17.433
Now where is she?

58:17.928 --> 58:21.034
So, you put the mole...

58:21.565 --> 58:25.479
Georgie? Okay, here we go.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.477
Ow!

58:31.575 --> 58:34.715
Georgie, what are you doing here?

58:36.680 --> 58:38.284
Well, Tessa,

58:40.083 --> 58:43.030
Reed was looking for you,
so I offered to help.

58:43.220 --> 58:44.494
Oh, I can't believe I did that.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.431
Um, right. Right.

58:47.357 --> 58:50.736
I will, um... I, Tessa, will take it
from here. Thank you, Georgie.

58:50.894 --> 58:51.895
You're welcome.

58:53.764 --> 58:55.243
- Hi.
- HI.

58:56.800 --> 59:00.009
- Sorry.
- You okay? You look a little bit flushed.

59:02.672 --> 59:04.310
- Sorry.
- No, you're okay.

59:05.942 --> 59:06.943
Um...

59:07.444 --> 59:09.355
Have you seen Bella? She's AWOL!

59:11.014 --> 59:14.223
Uh, no, she'll be back.
She promised not to disappear again.

59:14.618 --> 59:16.529
Yeah, right. So much for promises.

59:19.456 --> 59:20.730
Where was I?

59:22.459 --> 59:26.134
You know what? I think I...
I just saw Bella,

59:26.296 --> 59:28.741
and I think I should probably
just go check on her for Freddy...

59:28.765 --> 59:32.076
No, don't go, please.
I've got to go and perform In a minute.

59:32.235 --> 59:34.875
Um, this will just take a second.
Be right back.

59:40.777 --> 59:42.313
Okay.

59:42.479 --> 59:44.117
There you are!

59:45.749 --> 59:47.626
Divine! Hi.

59:48.085 --> 59:51.726
Oh, I know what you are doing.

59:51.888 --> 59:53.629
- You do?
- Yes.

59:54.091 --> 59:58.039
- These eyes see everything.
- They do?

59:58.328 --> 59:59.329
Hmm.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.503
Oh, I know you have
your own little fantasies

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:07.615
about being up on stage,

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:13.886
but lurking around the VIP area,
Cinderella, is just sad

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:17.753
and, frankly, a little creepy.

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:23.755
Right, yeah, of course. I'm so sorry.
No more creepy. Understood.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.457
Oh, good. Now where are those gowns?

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:28.928
- The gowns!
- The gowns!

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.230
Where are the gowns?

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.772
Yes, I was just about to pick
the gowns up, actually. You can come with,

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:37.002
unless, of course, you don't want
to be seen In, you know, the service area.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.612
Have them in the suite in five minutes.
You need to help us get dressed.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.183
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.863
Sorry I'm late.
I had to find more contacts.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.048
That's okay.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.213
Is this almost over?

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.140
No, now I need to be
In three places at once.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:55.563
Now that's what I call star power.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.460
Twirl, girls. Twirl for Sparkles.

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:04.937
- Oh, Tessa, I have something for you.
- For me?

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.803
I didn't forget you, Tessa. There you go.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:13.044
You can't go to a costume ball
without a costume.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.012
Wow.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:20.281
- Thank you, Divine.
- You're so welcome.

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:52.310
All right, girls, let the dazzling begin!

01:01:55.278 --> 01:02:00.023
Stand up straight. Smile. Chest forward.
Out of my way, big baby!

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:10.002
There's a lot of Cinderellas here,

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:12.470
but you girls look the best.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:13.776
Stand up straight, Olympia.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.671
Hello.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.008
<i>On the behalf of the Halstons
and Royal Lagoons Resorts,</i>

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:23.581
<i>welcome to the VIP costume ball!</i>

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.153
<i>- First, one little question.
- What?</i>

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.322
<i>Is anyone in this room ready to get loose?</i>

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:32.893
<i>Okay, play the music!</i>

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.787
Interesting choice of costume.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.760
I'm a penguin.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.322
Yes, you are.

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:46.428
Can you sneak away?

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:51.367
Uh, so we can finish the bike.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.004
I'll waddle out somehow.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.416
- Tessa?
- Yeah...

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:06.347
My hair broke.
You have to help me put It back together.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:16.587
Five minutes.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:20.966
<i>How's Your mystery girl
working out for you?</i>

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:24.164
She's talented, but she's flaky.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.275
Oh, I'm sure
she has her reasons for that.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:28.875
Yeah.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:32.272
Maybe I just would prefer
someone I can trust.

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:38.014
Someone who's funny, likes to laugh,

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:44.155
smart, of course,
smarter than me, probably,

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:52.696
who's amazingly cute and waddles.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:55.592
Um...

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.963
I think that should do it.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:01.242
- You wanna try and start her up?
- No, do the honors.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.383
Ah! You did it.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.318
We did it. We totally did it.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:28.728
What about Harper?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.901
There you are. You're supposed to be
meeting with the Halstons right now!

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.435
Uh, oh, yeah.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.846
Um, I lost track of time.
Can you give me one minute?

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.812
Oh, you need a minute?
By all means, yeah, take all the...

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.110
No, you can't have a minute!

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.178
We don't keep the big money waiting, Reed.

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:54.451
I'll call you later.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.994
Let's go. Let's go.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.759
Freddy.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:09.343
The Halstons. Um, will Harper be there?

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:13.037
Yeah, she's flying out to surprise Reed.
I arranged It.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:15.682
So they're together.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.977
Oh, Tessa.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.989
I know it must be a rush
being around a guy like Reed.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:28.152
- He's about to become a huge star.
- I could care less about that.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:31.691
Which is exactly
why Harper is so right for him.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:36.000
Look, I don't know what Reed told you,

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:39.333
but I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose
by the end of the month.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.566
What?

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:46.238
I'm sorry, Tessa, really. Sorry.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.609
<i>How could I have been so stupid?</i>

01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:59.416
I'm done. Done with the show.
I'm done with Reed,

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.256
and definitely clone with Bella Snow.

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.093
The show can't go on without Bella.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.328
He's resourceful.
He'll figure something out.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.745
Speaking of.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:14.132
Look, this is about you.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.735
Did you become Bella Snow to win a boy?

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.572
No.

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:25.875
- No, I became Bella Snow because I was...
- You were following your dream.

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:30.255
Freddy was a real wakeup call, Georgie.

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:36.427
I'm a nobody with just enough talent
to delude myself.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:42.264
<i>Tessa it's your decision,
but If you give up now,</i>

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:47.465
<i>you'll always wonder to your dying day,
what if?</i>

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.375
God, I miss you.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.545
I wish you were here, Dad.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.415
Well, not exactly here.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.292
Now, what would you do if you were me?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.618
- Very good.
- Bravo.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.087
Well done.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.754
It's just... It's hard to be Cinderella

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:53.765
when I know my Prince Charming
is in love with someone else.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.870
Get a grip, and focus on what's important.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:58.999
Yeah, you're right.

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:02.143
Go back out there,
and show them who you are, okay?

01:10:02.465 --> 01:10:03.773
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.935
Let's go. Okay.

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:11.174
Do you get what's going on?

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.782
- No.
- Ugh!

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.947
That's right. We're mean.
We don't like you. You're horrible.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.698
Ah.

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.306
Georgie?

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.375
Georgie?

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.908
Divine.

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.110
Cheerio, Bella.

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:59.451
I knew you smelled like cookies.

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:04.629
Did you really think
you could get away with this'?

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:09.731
Athena has the blood of a star
running through her veins,

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:13.738
and she will take her rightful place.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.375
Divine, please don't do this.

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.374
"Please don't do this, Divine."

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.046
Toodle-oo.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.881
Divine, no. No, no, no! Divine, please!

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:32.215
Divine, please! Can someone hear me?

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.560
Come on, think, Tessa. Think.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:42.927
Georgie, is Tessa all right?
She's not answering my calls or texts.

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.100
If you really care,
why don't you ask Freddy?

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:01.481
- She's the one.
- But how do we find her, My Prince?

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:05.983
We must search the land
to find the lovely Malden

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:08.856
whose delicate foot
fits this glass slipper.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.930
Why isn't Bella in position?

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:25.500
I don't know. I've been waiting
to dress her In... Where's her costume?

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:28.597
Oh. Ah.

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.210
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so fat?

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.143
- Mom!
- Let me try.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.881
- Uh-uh. Olympia, keep watch!
- Momma...

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:41.119
Put your arms through the thing!
Put your arms through!

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.281
Why can't I be Cinderella?

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:45.585
Because, Olympia,
you're just not good enough.

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.653
- Mom, wait.
- Your arms. Come on!

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.423
- Wait. Mom!
- What?

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:52.895
Who's gonna play my part?

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.351
Welcome to our humble home.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:24.493
His Highness requests the presence
of all the ladles of the house.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.933
My two daughters and I are...

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:30.165
Where's your sister, dear?

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.735
Who cares? Maybe, she's dead!

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:42.207
No, I remember. She's in her room.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.314
Silly me! How could I forget?

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:56.992
I meant she's far, far away in Detroit.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:00.000
Hold on! Hold on!

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.732
Here I am, Mother!

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:10.177
- .Just keep going, and find Bella!
- How could <i>I</i> stay In Detroit

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:14.547
when it's Royal Try On a Glass Shoe day!

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:36.232
Why waste your princely time
on ground beef

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:39.862
when you could have filet mignon?

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:47.371
Don't be afraid. I don't bite.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:51.910
Well, maybe a little bit here and there.

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:56.982
Actually, I'm just all cuddles.

01:16:57.379 --> 01:17:00.622
Go ahead. Ask my sister.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:05.064
- That doesn't appear to be an option.
- Uh?

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.433
What is happening out there?

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.206
I'll show Mom I'm good enough!

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.748
Stop it! Stop!

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.112
Give me that!

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:31.483
Stop it! You're ruining everything!

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.225
You evil girl! Come back here!

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:55.273
- Alas, it does not fit.
- Are you sure, Prince?

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.641
Really, really sure.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.247
Cram it in!

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:02.014
I don't care! No! Just do it!

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.988
Excuse me. I must go feed the horses.

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:13.995
Hello, buddy.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.733
Okay, so I'm kind of
In a situation right now.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.700
You've got to tell me which way to go,
sugar. That way or this way?

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:24.767
Oh.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.810
Okay, here we go.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.040
<i>No, I don't care.
We're not gonna stop the show.</i>

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.515
- Freddy
- No... Just do It. Do It!

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.787
What are you doing? I need you out there.

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.691
- First tell me what you said to Tessa.
- Tessa?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.081
Reed, the show's a mess.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:40.458
I can't find Bella...

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.428
- Stop it!
- What're they doing?

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:44.826
- I don't know. I don't care.
- This is Important!

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.727
There you are, Prince dear.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:51.902
Get out here, or I will cut you!

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.268
- What did you say to her? Just tell me.
- Go! Out.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.605
No. No, no, no.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:05.248
Right, if there are
no other ladies in the house,

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.512
then we must take our leave.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:12.182
Unless... Hark! Do you hear something?

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.191
Um...

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:18.089
Maybe?

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:23.129
I'm sure I must have heard a noise!

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:30.776
Oh, you're stepping on me!

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.940
Ow. Ow.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.943
Really?

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.249
Am I too late to try on the slipper? Ow!

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:52.530
Oh. Hello.
Am I too late to try on the slipper?

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:55.760
No! Am I too late to try on the slipper?

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:03.471
Oh, my God! What has gotten into you?
Stop It! No, no, no!

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.152
I'm not going back out
until you tell me what you said to Tessa.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:12.350
No! It's my shoe! I'm a princess!

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:13.851
I'm a princess!

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.022
Girls, you're not acting like ladies!

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:19.125
Let me go!

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:25.725
Okay, I may have said something about you
and Harper getting engaged. That's all.

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:27.732
Oh. Why, Freddy?
Why would you say that to Tessa?

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:29.030
Guys! Guys! Cover your mic!

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:32.502
All right, everybody!
Get ready for the new Cinderella!

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.213
You're on the verge of stardom.
Reed, I did It for you.

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:43.771
Look, I know you mean well, Freddy,

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.550
but you do not get
to make those calls for me!

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.918
<i>Harper's just a friend.
I don't like her that way.</i>

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:49.945
No!

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:54.292
Tessa, I mean she's sweet,
but what's the big deal?

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:58.624
<i>The big deal is, for the first time
In my life, I think I'm In love.</i>

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.766
Oh.

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:39.536
Bella.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.615
Am I too late to try on the slipper?

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.624
Tessa.

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:00.722
You're Cinderella?

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.098
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
who I really was.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:10.761
I never thought that a prince like you
could ever love a girl like me.

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:15.503
Not as sorry as I am
to have caused you any pain.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:21.145
My adviser, Frederico, spoke not the truth
of my Impending nuptials.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:25.281
Freddy totally lied
about me getting married to Harper.

01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:26.742
I heard.

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:30.789
Sound travels quite well in this kingdom.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.891
Please, try on the glass slipper.

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.853
I'd love to.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.206
You know what, I don't need a shoe
to tell me what I really feel In my heart.

01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:57.546
You're the one.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:06.450
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop It! You're disgusting!

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:13.829
Never fear. Your fairy godmother is here.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.128
Let the world see you as I do.

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:32.478
Twirl.

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:41.125
Whoa!

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:47.363
Yes! Come on!

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.067
Your fairy godmother does great work.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:23:59.841
She really does.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:17.039
- Call me.
- Thank you.

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:21.084
- That was incredible.
- HI.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:24.197
- I'm so proud of you.
- Georgie, I don't know how to thank you.

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.518
You don't have to.
I thought you might need this.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.429
You're the best.
What would I do without you?

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.629
Sorry, buddy. I messed up.

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:42.069
If you don't want me to be
your manager anymore, I'll understand.

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:43.705
No, of course I do.

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:46.605
Plus, you may even get the chance
to work with a talented new star.

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:50.944
Hey, Charming, let's bounce.

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:08.630
Tessa! Sweetie, we did it!

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.862
I know I can't take all the credit,

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:15.031
but it certainly wouldn't have happened
without me, right'?

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:18.701
Divine, you've been the best evil
stepmother a girl could ever ask for but...

01:27:18.867 --> 01:27:19.868
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:21.955
I think it's definitely time for us
to part ways.

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:28.686
Call me!

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.055
So, where do you wanna go?

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:38.725
Everywhere.

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:46.369
<i>At some point, we all come across
an exciting opportunity,</i>

01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:49.099
<i>a new path that might scare us.</i>

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:50.799
<i>My advice.</i>

01:27:51.166 --> 01:27:53.646
<i>Pop the clutch, pick the road,</i>

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:57.044
and make your happily ever after
<i>come</i> true.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.333
Sorry.
