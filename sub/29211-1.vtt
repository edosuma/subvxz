      That depends on you.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.470
   Really? I don't think so.

        I didn't see it.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.654
         Are you sure?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.861
    What are you going to do

     of the trust's assets.

      we go to the beach,
we live our lives how we want to

   up here when I was little.

   down there as little ants.

39:43.515 --> 39:47.984
   Well, we were God and they
     were our little people

40:15.580 --> 40:17.113
       And what about it?

40:17.115 --> 40:19.749

      love changes people?

        I have to spend

54:35.539 --> 54:37.006
   nine more months with him.

54:37.008 --> 54:39.508
    I'll be here, I'm here.

        I have to go to
       that stupid arcade

54:55.326 --> 54:57.893
     and play those fucking
     games just to see you?

55:02.700 --> 55:04.300
