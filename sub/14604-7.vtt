<i>Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.280
Our relationship never stood
a chance

00:09.282 --> 00:11.249
since you never stopped
comparing it to your old one.

00:11.251 --> 00:13.211
Are you regretting breaking
up with Weaver?

00:13.331 --> 00:13.826
No.

00:13.946 --> 00:15.920
- I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- I'm pregnant.

00:15.922 --> 00:17.855
Well, is it mine?

00:17.857 --> 00:19.791
- Maggie, I'm engaged.
- So I'm just on my own?

00:19.793 --> 00:20.958
I don't know what else
to tell you.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.026
What am I gonna do?

00:22.028 --> 00:23.427
You're gonna stay here tonight.

00:23.429 --> 00:25.530
When you wake up, we'll figure
out what your choices are.

00:25.532 --> 00:27.965
I'll be here for you.
I'll help however I can.

00:27.967 --> 00:31.502
I'm happy I took the leap
towards Sebastian,

00:31.504 --> 00:33.571

is in a million pieces.

01:03.152 --> 01:04.818
♪ Now I would say something

01:04.819 --> 01:07.454
"When Adam Weaver,
the wunderkind playwright,

01:07.456 --> 01:09.923
was asked what his next opus
was based on,

01:09.925 --> 01:13.894
he succinctly said,
a play about my ex,

01:13.896 --> 01:18.632
a diminutive, suburbanoseur
who I broke up with."

01:18.634 --> 01:19.766
Ouch.

01:19.768 --> 01:22.035
It sounds even worse
when it's read out loud.

01:22.037 --> 01:24.705
Why would Weaver do this to me?

01:24.707 --> 01:26.273
He called me small.

01:26.275 --> 01:27.641
Tiny, really,

01:27.643 --> 01:30.343
and a phony. I'd be most
pissed off about "suburban."

01:30.345 --> 01:32.879
That's the kiss of death
in Manhattan literary circles.

01:32.881 --> 01:35.315
And P.S....
I broke up with him.

01:35.317 --> 01:38.552
I mean, don't these gossip rags
fact-check?

01:38.554 --> 01:40.754
You should call them
and tell them what's what.

01:40.756 --> 01:42.189
I should.

01:42.391 --> 01:44.624
Except then you'd have to
out yourself

01:44.626 --> 01:46.760
as a diminutive,
suburban poseur.

01:46.762 --> 01:48.728
Then I shouldn't.

01:50.665 --> 01:52.665
I always dreamed that one day

01:52.667 --> 01:54.434
the literary world
would be talking about me,

01:54.436 --> 01:56.436
but I figured it would be
because they loved

01:56.438 --> 02:00.740
my insightful, provocative,
and well-reviewed novella.

02:00.742 --> 02:03.009
Well, some of your dream
is coming true.

02:03.011 --> 02:06.579
Buck up. You're nobody until
somebody is talking about you.

02:06.581 --> 02:08.948
I come bearing gifts!

02:08.949 --> 02:10.282
Well, maybe this will
cheer me up.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.352
Doubtful. When Larissa
says "gifts,"

02:12.354 --> 02:14.620
she usually means
menial, horrible tasks

02:14.622 --> 02:17.423
that will be given to us.
Beep-y things for everyone!

02:17.425 --> 02:19.592
Oh! We're getting pagers.

02:19.594 --> 02:22.528
That is so cool.
I've always wanted a beeper.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.931
It's so "St. Elsewhere,"
being on call, being important.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.365
Don't kid yourself.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.601
Now we're going to be tied to
Andy like one of his lap dogs.

02:28.603 --> 02:30.937
Scratch that. His dogs
are treated better than this.

02:30.939 --> 02:33.339
Be lucky you're just an intern
and won't get one.

02:33.341 --> 02:38.544
Now Andy expects you all
to be on call 24-slash-7.

02:38.546 --> 02:41.714
- I'm not getting paid enough for this.
- Oh, don't be grumpy.

02:41.716 --> 02:43.482
Oh, and everybody who calls here
for you

02:43.484 --> 02:44.917
will be given
your beeper number

02:44.919 --> 02:47.053
so they can reach you
<i>immediamente.</i>

02:47.055 --> 02:50.156
Oh, God. What's next?
Cellular phones for everyone?

02:50.158 --> 02:52.992
Don't be ridiculous.
That will never happen.

02:54.961 --> 02:56.228
For me?

02:56.230 --> 02:58.531
You, my little lilliputian,
have arrived.

02:58.533 --> 03:01.367
Oh. So you heard about
the "Page Six" piece.

03:01.369 --> 03:02.802
You're getting a pager,
aren't you?

03:02.804 --> 03:04.804
What he said isn't even true.

03:04.806 --> 03:06.272
Not that that matters.

03:06.274 --> 03:07.540
Once a rumor is out there,

03:07.542 --> 03:09.909
that's the only thing
people will believe.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.320 --> 03:22.187
Well, well, well.

03:22.189 --> 03:24.823
Looks like the rumors are true.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.258
Don't believe everything
you hear.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.193
Oh, I don't,
but I also have eyes,

03:28.195 --> 03:30.262
and... you two
look awfully cozy.

03:30.264 --> 03:31.363
Butt out.

03:31.365 --> 03:33.432
Oh, you're still sour.

03:33.434 --> 03:34.866
I would assume snagging the Kydd

03:34.986 --> 03:36.483
would've put a spring
in your step.

03:36.603 --> 03:38.637
Yep, well, you know what
they say about assuming.

03:39.706 --> 03:42.207
I don't, and I don't...
really care.

03:42.209 --> 03:44.543
I wonder what Merry Carrie
would think.

03:44.545 --> 03:45.777
Although I'm guessing
she doesn't have much time

03:45.779 --> 03:47.012
for either of you these days,

03:47.014 --> 03:50.482
so busy
with her fancy Manhattan beau.

03:50.484 --> 03:52.150
Lay off, Donna, all right?

03:52.152 --> 03:54.386
Look at <i>you,</i>
being all protective.

03:54.388 --> 03:56.455
You always are when it comes
to your lady friends.

03:56.457 --> 03:58.190
It's sweet, really.

03:58.192 --> 04:00.993
Just wish it'd been
for an actual lady...

04:00.995 --> 04:01.927
Instead of her.

04:01.929 --> 04:05.130
I will take you...
and enjoy it.

04:05.132 --> 04:08.767
Don't be so touchy.
Got what you wanted, didn't you?

04:12.538 --> 04:15.273
Okay, we have to stop this.

04:15.275 --> 04:16.241
Stop what?

04:16.243 --> 04:17.476
This rumor that we're dating.

04:17.478 --> 04:18.976
I don't care what
those idiots think.

04:18.978 --> 04:20.612
I do.

04:20.613 --> 04:21.947
Not... not about Donna

04:21.949 --> 04:24.049
and all those beady
little eyes on us,

04:24.051 --> 04:25.917
but I-I care about Carrie.

04:25.919 --> 04:31.056
I got the feeling that
she was open to...

04:31.058 --> 04:34.292
I don't know...
maybe... talking,

04:34.294 --> 04:35.994
being friends again.

04:35.996 --> 04:39.097
Look... I didn't wanna
say anything to you

04:39.099 --> 04:41.299
because of everything
you're going through,

04:41.301 --> 04:44.402
but Carrie saw you the night
you slept at my house.

04:44.404 --> 04:47.472
What? How?

04:47.474 --> 04:50.208
I'm not sure.
I-I saw a car driving off,

04:50.210 --> 04:52.510
and when I opened the door,
my jacket was there...

04:52.512 --> 04:55.847
the one I gave her...
like she left it.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.282
Why would she do that?

04:57.284 --> 05:00.518
To... get rid
of the last reminder of me?

05:00.520 --> 05:02.687
I don't know. But in order
to explain to her

05:02.689 --> 05:03.988
why you were there...

05:03.990 --> 05:07.892
I would have to explain
what's going on with me.

05:07.894 --> 05:09.560
You ready to do that?

05:09.562 --> 05:11.596
No.

05:11.598 --> 05:16.601
I'm just gonna have to
figure out what I'm going to do.

05:16.603 --> 05:18.369
What am I gonna do?

05:18.371 --> 05:21.839
Whatever you decide,
I'm here, okay?

05:28.447 --> 05:31.315
You wanna get a grilled cheese
and chili fries?

05:31.317 --> 05:33.284
We always get that.

05:33.286 --> 05:34.285
Milkshake?

05:34.287 --> 05:36.020
We could mix it up
and add banana.

05:36.022 --> 05:38.055
Nah.

05:39.626 --> 05:42.426
I'm not even hungry.

05:42.428 --> 05:44.161
Me either.

05:44.163 --> 05:46.197
We're in a food rut.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.566
Wanna work on our
college applications instead?

05:48.568 --> 05:51.135
Oh, my God.

05:51.137 --> 05:53.003
We are so boring!

05:53.005 --> 05:57.708
No.  No.
We're...

05:57.710 --> 06:00.444
Totally and completely boring.

06:00.446 --> 06:03.214
- How did this happen?
- We're busy?

06:03.216 --> 06:06.750
Okay, mister, we have only been
dating eight months.

06:06.752 --> 06:08.352
This cannot be our lives...

06:08.354 --> 06:11.622
Eating
at the diner and homework.

06:11.624 --> 06:15.459
We need to add
some spice to our life.

06:15.461 --> 06:18.028
Let's do it in your car.
Stat!

06:18.030 --> 06:20.130
I have to get
to basketball practice.

06:21.733 --> 06:23.267
Right.

06:23.269 --> 06:25.002
Of course. I forgot.

06:25.004 --> 06:26.804
But after practice...

06:26.806 --> 06:28.472
I have S.A.T. prep.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.375
- We're doomed.
- Mouse...

06:31.377 --> 06:32.743
We'll be fine.

06:32.745 --> 06:35.913
No, we are going to better
than fine.

06:35.915 --> 06:39.283
We are going... to be hot!

06:39.285 --> 06:41.618
Hot, hot, hot.

06:42.654 --> 06:43.954
Just not tonight.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.060
- Not again.
- Larissa?

06:50.062 --> 06:51.662
Probably.

06:51.664 --> 06:54.097
Are you gonna call her back?
It could be an emergency.

06:54.099 --> 06:56.033
Oh, like the last call,
when I had to tell her

06:56.035 --> 06:57.734
where her tampons are?
Left drawer.

06:57.736 --> 06:59.302
Or the call before that

06:59.304 --> 07:02.172
for her condoms... right drawer.
Bennet said it.

07:02.174 --> 07:05.242
You know, these pagers...
they're like gilded handcuffs.

07:05.244 --> 07:07.577
Yeah. Bennet's pretty P.O.'d
about it.

07:07.579 --> 07:09.880
He just feels
really underappreciated

07:09.882 --> 07:11.114
at the magazine,

07:11.116 --> 07:12.549
and these beepers
are the last straw.

07:12.551 --> 07:14.885
Well, he's not gonna quit,
is he?

07:14.887 --> 07:16.720
He's threatening to.

07:16.722 --> 07:18.288
His other fantasy is to just
walk right up to Andy

07:18.290 --> 07:20.790
and give him an ultimatum...
promotion or bust.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.158
Well, from what I know
about Andy,

07:22.160 --> 07:23.526
that will not go well.

07:23.528 --> 07:25.061
That's what <i>I'm</i> worried about.

07:25.063 --> 07:26.129
When it comes to work,

07:26.131 --> 07:27.597
you shouldn't draw attention
to yourself

07:27.599 --> 07:29.099
except for the work, you know?

07:29.101 --> 07:31.501
Oh. With all this "Page Six"
drama I'm dealing with,

07:31.503 --> 07:32.669
I totally hear you.

07:34.713 --> 07:36.210
Larissa?

07:36.330 --> 07:38.441
I should probably call her.

07:38.443 --> 07:41.177
Maybe she can't find
her douche.

07:41.179 --> 07:42.712
Ew.

07:46.251 --> 07:47.884
Are you sure?

07:47.886 --> 07:49.486
Yeah. I am.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.957
I have decided to get...

07:53.959 --> 07:56.326
an abortion.

07:57.361 --> 07:59.896
Can you take me
to my appointment?

07:59.898 --> 08:01.331
I-it's totally cool
if you can't.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.633
Stop. I'm taking you.

08:05.869 --> 08:08.471
Always wanted a ride
in that car of yours.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.474
I've been trying
to reach you for ages.

08:11.476 --> 08:12.575
Where have you been?

08:12.577 --> 08:14.077
Uh, class.

08:14.079 --> 08:15.978
Oh, right.
I always forget that.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.481
When do you finish
at that place? This week?

08:18.483 --> 08:19.782
Um, I-it's November,

08:19.784 --> 08:22.018
so I'm... I'm pretty much here
until June.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.886
Is there something you needed?

08:23.888 --> 08:25.221
Uh, yes, yes.

08:25.223 --> 08:28.391
Tristan Cassidy called here
from "Page Six."

08:28.393 --> 08:30.159
He found out you dated Weaver

08:30.161 --> 08:31.827
and is fishing around,
trying to figure out if you are,

08:31.829 --> 08:34.196
and I quote...

08:34.198 --> 08:36.432
"The diminutive, suburban
poseur who got dumped."

08:36.433 --> 08:39.168
Oh, no.
"Oh, no" is right.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.937
I thought you said that all...
all press is good press,

08:41.938 --> 08:44.407
- even bad press.
- It <i>is...</i>

08:44.409 --> 08:46.008
Until Andy's involved.

08:46.010 --> 08:47.109
He can be very touchy

08:47.111 --> 08:48.744
about how he and the magazine
are perceived.

08:48.746 --> 08:51.347
There can be no poseurs
in Andy's world.

08:51.349 --> 08:53.048
- So now what?
- So now...

08:53.050 --> 08:56.352
you either convince "Page Six"
the subject isn't you,

08:56.354 --> 08:57.953
or you face Andy's wrath.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.508
I cannot believe I'm here on
a Saturday, stuffing envelopes.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.776
I don't even make overtime.

09:12.778 --> 09:15.545
I don't even make any money.
I just make cappuccinos.

09:15.547 --> 09:16.780
Which are incredible.

09:16.782 --> 09:17.881
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying them,

09:17.883 --> 09:20.450
because if I can't convince
Tristan Cassidy

09:20.452 --> 09:22.185
that I am not some poseur,

09:22.187 --> 09:23.987
then that's what I'll be making
for the rest of my life.

09:23.989 --> 09:25.355
Are you going to call him back?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.456
I don't know.

09:26.458 --> 09:27.991
I-I wish I could
talk to him directly, in person,

09:27.993 --> 09:29.092
so he could meet me

09:29.094 --> 09:31.194
and see that I am not the lies
Weaver made up.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.629
I think you should just ignore
the whole thing.

09:32.631 --> 09:34.231
Don't give the guy
more ammunition.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.932
I think you should
set the record straight.

09:35.934 --> 09:37.200
Tell him what's what.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.569
I think we should dump all these
envelopes into the river

09:39.571 --> 09:41.638
and tell Andy we're too good
to be stuffing envelopes

09:41.640 --> 09:43.406
on a weekend.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.375
What am I, the intern?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.576
No offense.

09:46.578 --> 09:48.511
Why do people always say
"No offense"

09:48.513 --> 09:50.146
right after
they've offended you?

09:50.148 --> 09:51.414
I work my butt off,

09:51.416 --> 09:53.683
and Andy won't even give me
a feature to write.

09:53.685 --> 09:56.353
Just blurbs and "Hot Boîtes."
I want more.

09:56.355 --> 09:59.089
Who'd want more than hot butts?

09:59.091 --> 10:00.690
"Hot Boîtes."
It means "Cool Restaurants."

10:00.692 --> 10:03.426
Which was really fun
for the first two years.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.894
But I wanna keep growing
in my job

10:04.896 --> 10:07.464
and not feel
so taken for granted.

10:07.466 --> 10:09.332
That's because Andy knows
he has you.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.800
A boss is like a man.

10:10.802 --> 10:12.535
Once he knows he's got you,

10:12.537 --> 10:15.104
it's like practically giving him
permission to ignore you.

10:15.106 --> 10:17.507
It's like my parents' marriage.
Sounds delightful.

10:17.509 --> 10:19.209
Not that a man has ever
ignored me.

10:19.211 --> 10:21.744
But if he did,
I would have ten guys lined up

10:21.746 --> 10:23.947
so he would know
he's got competition.

10:23.949 --> 10:25.682
Or at least make it seem
that way.

10:25.684 --> 10:27.016
I think that might work.

10:27.018 --> 10:29.552
I'm just not exactly sure how
to get to these media guys.

10:29.554 --> 10:32.889
I tried cold calling once.
I never heard back from anyone.

10:32.891 --> 10:34.424
You have to meet them
on their field.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.692
Seem like an equal,

10:35.694 --> 10:38.227
and preferably holding alcohol.

10:38.229 --> 10:39.829
Like at the Paris party tonight.

10:39.831 --> 10:40.830
The what?

10:40.832 --> 10:41.931
The Paris party.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.332
Everyone who's invited
puts in 50 bucks,

10:43.334 --> 10:44.634
and at the end of the night,

10:44.636 --> 10:46.002
someone's name is pulled
from the hat,

10:46.004 --> 10:48.437
and that person gets to go
on a trip to Paris

10:48.439 --> 10:50.540
with a friend, all paid for.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.308
Oh. Awesome.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.043
I've always wanted
to go to Paris.

10:54.045 --> 10:55.745
How did I not know about this?

10:55.747 --> 10:58.915
Every fancy artist
and media type will be there.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.216
Well, no wonder
no one appreciates me.

11:00.218 --> 11:02.518
I don't even have my finger
on the social pulse.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.787
Lucky for you, I do.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.155
You wanna go?

11:06.157 --> 11:07.757
Seriously?
You can get us in?

11:07.759 --> 11:09.625
Will Tristan Cassidy be there?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.428
- I'm guessing.
- Oh, well, then I am there.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.398
Well, then let's pack
our bags and get going.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.032
Do you think I should wear
a chapeau?

11:17.034 --> 11:19.235
I wanna look my best
when I get my reputation back.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.402
Mm.

11:20.404 --> 11:21.437
Mm.

11:21.439 --> 11:24.373
When you said
"Spice up our lives,"

11:24.375 --> 11:26.008
I did not think you meant food.

11:26.010 --> 11:27.643
Those tacos were intense.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.245
Oh, that was just phase one

11:29.247 --> 11:31.814
of project
<i>Mucho Caliente Relaciones.</i>

11:31.816 --> 11:34.483
What is this,
a secret military operation?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.486
Keeping our relationship hot
is serious business.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.623
Apparently, chili peppers
increase the libido.

11:40.625 --> 11:41.857
I researched it.

11:41.859 --> 11:43.058
But doesn't planning
all this stuff

11:43.060 --> 11:45.194
take the fun out of it,
makes it less spontaneous?

11:45.196 --> 11:46.862
Oh, I don't think
you'll feel that way

11:46.864 --> 11:50.532
when you see the surprise
I left you in your backpack.

11:51.768 --> 11:53.535
Not now.

11:53.537 --> 11:55.504
Later.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.841
Okay. Part of the fun of
this is the anticipation.

11:58.843 --> 12:03.712
I read that anticipation
is also an aphrodisiac.

12:03.714 --> 12:05.147
Well, I hope not too much
of one

12:05.149 --> 12:07.024
since I have to head
to basketball practice.

12:08.271 --> 12:10.485
- See you at the game?
- I'll be there.

12:10.487 --> 12:14.289
In fact... I can't wait.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.958
See?

12:15.960 --> 12:18.026
Anticipation!

12:18.028 --> 12:20.395
Already making me feel <i>sexy.</i>

12:20.397 --> 12:22.831
Great.
Well, I'll see you later.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.766
Mm-hmm.

12:28.237 --> 12:29.738
Are you ready?

12:32.341 --> 12:36.144
I think so. I just can't
seem to open the door.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.747
There's no rush.

12:40.650 --> 12:44.219
You know, I've always
wanted to be a mom.

12:46.455 --> 12:48.423
Have a family.

12:48.425 --> 12:50.492
You still can.

12:50.494 --> 12:53.461
This doesn't change that.

12:53.463 --> 12:56.664
It's all I've ever imagined,
being a mom.

12:59.368 --> 13:01.936
I'm not like Mouse and Carrie.

13:01.938 --> 13:04.339
I don't have
these... big dreams.

13:04.341 --> 13:06.975
This was my dream.

13:06.977 --> 13:10.812
Not like this, but one day.

13:13.069 --> 13:15.984
And here I am, destroying it.

13:15.986 --> 13:18.086
You don't have to do this.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.687
What are my options?
Raise a kid by myself?

13:19.689 --> 13:21.456
Nobody does that.

13:21.458 --> 13:22.523
Adoption?

13:22.525 --> 13:25.326
Or... your parents
can help you...

13:25.328 --> 13:27.228
No. They would kill me
if they found out.

13:27.230 --> 13:30.531
They can never know,
Sebastian... never.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.584
I'm so scared.

13:49.586 --> 13:51.018
I'm getting you out of here.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.454
- No, my appointment.
- Not today.

13:53.456 --> 13:55.056
You can't rush this decision.

13:55.058 --> 13:58.059
It's not like I have
a lot of time on this.

13:58.061 --> 13:59.293
I know.

13:59.295 --> 14:01.162
But it can wait a day or two.

14:01.164 --> 14:04.632
I just don't want you to make
a decision you're gonna regret.

14:08.484 --> 14:09.642
Me either.

14:12.941 --> 14:15.142
Do you want me
to take you home?

14:15.144 --> 14:17.645
Can we just drive for a little?

14:17.647 --> 14:19.914
Yeah, sure.

14:26.621 --> 14:29.189
Hey, West.
You got those pages

14:29.191 --> 14:30.557
coach gave us
for the flex offense?

14:30.559 --> 14:31.592
Yeah, sure do.

14:31.594 --> 14:32.760
Awesome.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.162
Can't believe he gave us
all these new plays

14:35.164 --> 14:36.964
right before
our first conference game.

14:36.966 --> 14:39.600
That's why we're doing
these additional practices.

14:39.602 --> 14:41.835
And don't worry. I think it'd be
a cool thing to add to our game.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.505
Mix things up a bit. Says the
guy with a photographic memory.

14:44.507 --> 14:48.008
Faith, Pendleton.
We'll make it work.

14:49.511 --> 14:51.211
All right, see you out there.

14:59.854 --> 15:01.421
Boobs.

15:01.423 --> 15:03.624
♪ When I'm with you, baby ♪

15:03.626 --> 15:05.192
♪ I go out of my head

15:05.194 --> 15:07.227
♪ I just can't get enough ♪

15:07.229 --> 15:08.962
♪ I just can't get enough ♪

15:11.634 --> 15:13.667
This is so exciting.

15:13.669 --> 15:15.168
♪ I just can't get enough ♪

15:15.170 --> 15:16.870
Oh, we're not going in
that way.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.171
Huh?

15:18.173 --> 15:19.506
We're going in this way.

15:21.210 --> 15:25.579
♪ and I just can't seem
to get enough ♪

15:31.119 --> 15:33.653
I thought you knew people.

15:33.655 --> 15:35.989
I do. Alvaro, the busboy.

15:35.991 --> 15:38.758
Hey!
<i>Gracias,</i> Alvaro!

15:39.894 --> 15:41.361
<i>¿Cómo está su niña?</i>

15:41.363 --> 15:44.497
<i>Bien, bien, señorita</i> Samantha.
You are such a sweet girl.

15:44.499 --> 15:46.666
We worked together
a few months back.

15:46.668 --> 15:49.302
He only busboys the best events.
Mm-hmm.

15:49.304 --> 15:51.304
This is terrible idea.
Carrie, you're just going to

15:51.306 --> 15:53.106
add fuel to the story
by addressing it.

15:53.108 --> 15:55.508
And, Bennet, just let your work
be the thing people notice.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.377
You don't need to be
running around a party

15:57.379 --> 15:58.978
like a peacock
asking for attention.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.447
Are you insane?

16:00.449 --> 16:02.615
In order to get ahead,
you need to not just work,

16:02.617 --> 16:04.651
but work it. And, Carrie,

16:04.653 --> 16:05.885
if you don't destroy the idea

16:05.887 --> 16:07.287
that you're some
unimportant poseur,

16:07.289 --> 16:08.721
that rumor will become
the truth

16:08.723 --> 16:10.223
before you even know
what hit you.

16:10.225 --> 16:11.991
Now there is a free trip

16:11.993 --> 16:13.660
to Paris out there
just waiting for us,

16:13.662 --> 16:17.078
not to mention free booze
and some canapé.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.480
So pick up a tray...

16:18.482 --> 16:20.882
And get out there.

16:20.884 --> 16:23.818
Come on. Let's go!

16:25.489 --> 16:29.390
<i>Samantha was right. I had</i>
<i>to face these rumors head-on,</i>

16:29.392 --> 16:31.693
<i>and the people</i>
<i>who had written them.</i>

16:33.296 --> 16:37.398
♪ And I just can't seem
to get enough ♪

16:38.768 --> 16:40.368
<i>I just didn't expect to be</i>
<i>face-to-face</i>

16:40.370 --> 16:44.105
<i>with the man</i>
<i>who had started them.</i>

16:49.875 --> 16:52.209
- You okay with that tray?
- Yeah.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.912
Sure. I, uh...
Couldn't find the bar,

16:54.914 --> 16:56.413
so I just grabbed this.

16:59.117 --> 17:00.884
Can never have
too much champagne, right?

17:00.886 --> 17:02.152
- Yeah.
- And I-I'm here

17:02.154 --> 17:04.555
with people, so...
They're thirsty, too.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.790
Sure. You mind if I...

17:06.791 --> 17:08.058
No, not at all.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.694
Yeah, you know, I think
I might have one, too, now.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.300
So how is everything?

17:16.301 --> 17:19.502
It's good.
Yeah, it's good.

17:19.505 --> 17:20.938
You?

17:20.940 --> 17:22.229
Working on my new play,

17:22.348 --> 17:24.012
and "Strange Angels" is...
Is in rehearsals.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.542
We open in about a month.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.511
Oh, and we got, uh,
Andrew McCarthy for the lead.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.980
That's amazing.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.015
You hadn't heard?

17:31.017 --> 17:34.952
Nope. I've been busy
with stuff.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.520
Oh, well, I'll let you go.

17:36.522 --> 17:37.621
I know you've got
a tray of drinks

17:37.623 --> 17:40.457
to hand out to your...
people.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.926
Yep. Sure do.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.496
It was great seeing you,
Carrie.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.765
Yeah, you, too.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.807
I am on record saying
this whole thing is a bad idea.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.842
Oh, my God.
There's Tristan Cassidy.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.077
Should I go talk to him?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.211
- No!
- Yes!

18:01.213 --> 18:02.312
What would I say?

18:02.314 --> 18:03.547
- Tristan!
- I'm going.

18:03.549 --> 18:04.548
You...

18:04.550 --> 18:06.183
Tristan! Yoo-hoo!

18:06.185 --> 18:08.252
Tristan, darling.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.168
So good to see you.

18:11.288 --> 18:12.756
You may not remember me,

18:12.758 --> 18:14.825
but we met a few weeks ago
at Odeon.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.993
It was a long night.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.429
Right, right, of course.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.297
Oh, and you remember

18:20.299 --> 18:21.832
my friend Bennet
from "Interview."

18:21.834 --> 18:23.000
Sure. Sure.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.035
Bennet Wilcox,
and this is Walt.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.703
Hey.

18:26.705 --> 18:31.575
Darlings! Oh, mwah! Mwah!
How exciting! You're all here!

18:32.610 --> 18:34.845
You're Tristan Cassidy.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.546
Yes, I am.

18:36.548 --> 18:37.481
Charmed.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.718
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.886
Mind if I join you?

18:42.888 --> 18:44.054
Not at all.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.089
- It's great seeing you again.
-  - You, too.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.527
You didn't tell me
you know Tristan Cassidy.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.229
You didn't tell us
about this party.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.830
Oh, this is the hottest ticket
in town.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.466
I certainly wasn't gonna
waste it on you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.768
Why?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.769
Because you're... you.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.738
And I always see you.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.708
But if you win the trip
to Paris, you must take me.

19:04.710 --> 19:05.976
I insist.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.711
I would take Walt.

19:07.713 --> 19:11.548
Of course. So predictable.
But what isn't predictable

19:11.550 --> 19:13.783
is that you finagled
a ticket to this.

19:13.785 --> 19:14.985
Very impressed.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.187
Andy always worries
you don't have what it takes

19:17.189 --> 19:19.556
to get all access.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.958
A-Andy thinks that?

19:23.195 --> 19:25.929
Well, I... guess
Andy thinks wrong.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.464
Andy is never wrong.

19:27.466 --> 19:28.531
About Bennet, he is.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.934
He didn't just get us
into the party.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.802
He got Carrie and Samantha
in, too.

19:32.804 --> 19:35.338
Bennet's a big deal.
Big.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.506
In fact...

19:36.508 --> 19:39.242
Tristan was just over here

19:39.244 --> 19:41.477
discussing
Bennet's future plans.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.216
You wouldn't leave "Interview"
for him, would you?

19:47.218 --> 19:50.253
- I...
- They're talking.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.957
So..

19:54.959 --> 19:56.359
Did you like my surprise?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.928
I did. It was amazing.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.930
Were you shocked?

20:00.932 --> 20:04.067
Not really.
You know what I like.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.370
Yeah. I do.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.772
Although I wish I hadn't
eaten it before the game.

20:09.774 --> 20:11.040
My stomach hurts a little bit.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.475
What do you mean, ate it?

20:12.477 --> 20:14.343
The chocolate bar
you left in my bag.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.279
I didn't leave
a chocolate bar in your bag.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.180
- You didn't?
- No.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.917
I left you a surprise
in your notebook.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.585
Then where was
the chocolate bar from?

20:22.587 --> 20:23.819
That really doesn't matter.

20:23.821 --> 20:27.523
Did you see a picture
in your notebook?

20:27.525 --> 20:29.025
Didn't even look.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.726
Well...

20:30.728 --> 20:32.928
Look now!

20:35.365 --> 20:36.899
Oh, I remember.

20:36.901 --> 20:39.301
I bought that chocolate bar
a few weeks ago.

20:39.303 --> 20:42.338
I do not care about
that stupid chocolate bar.

20:47.345 --> 20:48.811
Do you see it?

20:48.813 --> 20:51.814
No. It must have fallen out
or something.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.920
Maybe it's in here.

20:57.922 --> 20:59.688
Hold this.

21:02.759 --> 21:03.859
It's not in here.

21:03.861 --> 21:05.227
Maybe if you told me
what it was...

21:05.229 --> 21:07.796
It was a picture of me...

21:08.898 --> 21:10.833
Topless.

21:10.835 --> 21:13.802
Oh, no way.
That's awesome.

21:13.804 --> 21:16.472
You need to get focused, buddy.

21:16.474 --> 21:19.341
This is a serious problem
if the photo has gone missing.

21:19.343 --> 21:21.210
Right, right, of course.

21:21.212 --> 21:22.611
You need to find that picture

21:22.613 --> 21:24.213
and make sure no one
figures out it's me.

21:24.215 --> 21:25.747
Won't they be able to tell

21:25.749 --> 21:28.150
when they see it's a picture
of... you?

21:28.152 --> 21:31.720
It's just my boobs,
not my face.

21:31.722 --> 21:32.754
Why?

21:32.756 --> 21:34.222
For this very reason!

21:34.224 --> 21:36.191
You need to trace your steps

21:36.193 --> 21:38.093
so we can figure this out.

21:38.095 --> 21:39.661
Where were you last?

21:39.663 --> 21:41.263
The locker room.

21:41.265 --> 21:44.232
No.

21:44.234 --> 21:46.535
No! No!

21:46.537 --> 21:47.569
I'm on it, I'm on it.

21:51.408 --> 21:52.474
Boys, boys, <i>boys,</i>

21:52.476 --> 21:55.143
how could you ever think
these were mine?

21:55.145 --> 21:57.579
Way too small.
They're perky, though.

21:57.581 --> 21:59.347
What you looking at?

21:59.349 --> 22:00.615
Fun bags.

22:00.617 --> 22:02.884
Sweet. Whose?

22:02.886 --> 22:05.220
That's what we're trying
to figure out. Wanna see?

22:06.290 --> 22:08.223
Maybe one of the Jens?

22:08.225 --> 22:10.792
Eh, not them.
They're flat as pancakes.

22:10.794 --> 22:12.160
All right, boys.

22:12.162 --> 22:13.561
Game time.

22:13.563 --> 22:16.998
I wanna see some
heads-up ball out there.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.833
Let's go, boys.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.704
You comin'?
Be right there.

22:29.979 --> 22:32.981
<i>While West was relieved to know</i>
<i>his crisis was over...</i>

22:34.151 --> 22:36.217
<i>I was still trying</i>
<i>to manage mine,</i>

22:36.219 --> 22:39.587
<i>and that meant getting answers</i>
<i>from Weaver.</i>

22:44.960 --> 22:46.227
We meet again.

22:46.229 --> 22:47.729
Yeah, well, it's not such
a big party,

22:47.731 --> 22:51.299
so it's probably inevitable.
And I wanted to talk to you.

22:51.301 --> 22:52.734
Well, I'm always happy
to see you.

22:52.736 --> 22:53.835
Mm-hmm, me, too.

22:53.837 --> 22:55.436
And I'm really glad
that you don't seem

22:55.438 --> 22:58.106
to have any, um,
hard feelings for...

22:58.108 --> 22:59.941
You know, the way we ended.

22:59.943 --> 23:03.544
I don't... at all.
It just didn't work out.

23:03.546 --> 23:06.280
So why did you say those things
about me to "Page Six"?

23:07.649 --> 23:08.850
Were you misquoted?

23:08.852 --> 23:10.051
Not at all.

23:10.053 --> 23:13.855
In fact, I was very careful
about the words I chose.

23:13.857 --> 23:16.023
I'm a wordsmith, after all.

23:16.025 --> 23:18.960
Well, then if you're not mad,
why did you say those things?

23:18.962 --> 23:21.128
In this city, everything is
about perception.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.831
Who was the Victor
and who was the vanquished?

23:23.833 --> 23:26.233
And in order for me
to come out on top,

23:26.235 --> 23:28.969
you had to take the hit.

23:28.971 --> 23:30.004
It wasn't personal.

23:30.006 --> 23:31.305
You can't be serious.

23:31.307 --> 23:33.274
I mean, we were
in a relationship...

23:33.276 --> 23:36.510
an intimate one,
and I-I cared about you.

23:36.512 --> 23:38.479
You cared about me?

23:39.347 --> 23:40.781
Is that why you broke up
with me

23:40.783 --> 23:43.050
and ran right back to that guy,
because you cared about me?

23:43.052 --> 23:44.418
It wasn't like that, really.

23:47.557 --> 23:50.991
You're just lucky
I didn't name you.

23:52.060 --> 23:53.227
But I can if you want.

23:53.229 --> 23:54.962
I know
Tristan Cassidy's

23:54.964 --> 23:56.864
been sniffing around
for your name.

23:56.866 --> 24:01.335
And he is right over there.

24:05.573 --> 24:08.509
Well, unlucky for you,
he's talking to my friends.

24:17.319 --> 24:18.986
Sorry to interrupt. Um...

24:18.988 --> 24:21.421
Would you like a hot story
on the wunderkind Adam Weaver?

24:21.423 --> 24:23.023
The story he gave you?

24:23.025 --> 24:26.260
Total lie. He...
he's pathological, really.

24:26.262 --> 24:29.396
Every girl dumps him because
he's a needy, insecure bastard.

24:29.398 --> 24:32.799
And he's no wunderkind
in the bedroom, either.

24:32.801 --> 24:36.003
Teeny-tiny. At least...
that's what I've heard.

24:36.005 --> 24:37.437
It's true.

24:37.439 --> 24:38.805
Can I quote you on that?

24:38.807 --> 24:39.973
Definitely.

24:39.975 --> 24:42.142
And you are?

24:42.144 --> 24:45.245
Katja Morningstar.

24:46.114 --> 24:47.581
One of his exes.

24:51.419 --> 24:52.619
Excuse me.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.787
Thank you for the story.

24:53.789 --> 24:56.456
Oh. My pleasure.

25:08.103 --> 25:09.135
Hello?

25:09.137 --> 25:10.403
Sebastian?

25:10.405 --> 25:11.838
Yeah, it's me.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.707
What's going on?

25:13.709 --> 25:15.975
Look, I-I'm sorry
to bother you,

25:15.977 --> 25:18.011
and I wouldn't call
unless it was important.

25:18.013 --> 25:20.280
It's Maggie.
She collapsed.

25:28.616 --> 25:29.816
Sebastian.

25:29.818 --> 25:31.518
What happened?
What... what's wrong with her?

25:31.520 --> 25:34.387
They don't know.
I was taking her home from...

25:34.389 --> 25:37.424
And she just collapsed.
They're running tests now.

25:37.426 --> 25:40.460
Well, I'm sorry it took so long.
There was traffic.

25:40.462 --> 25:42.162
Oh, I'm just grateful
you're here.

25:42.164 --> 25:43.797
I didn't know who else to call.

25:45.300 --> 25:46.966
You must hate
that I always lean on you.

25:46.968 --> 25:50.603
I don't hate that.

25:53.808 --> 25:56.109
So where are her parents?
Did you call them?

25:56.111 --> 25:58.044
Maggie doesn't want them
to know she's here.

25:58.046 --> 25:59.579
What could possibly be going on

25:59.581 --> 26:01.481
that she doesn't want
her parents to know?

26:01.483 --> 26:04.984
I shouldn't say anything.
Maggie doesn't...

26:04.986 --> 26:06.352
I mean...

26:07.555 --> 26:09.188
She's pregnant?

26:12.060 --> 26:13.760
Is she pregnant?

26:15.729 --> 26:17.663
Look, Carrie,

26:17.665 --> 26:20.466
it's not mine. Carrie,
Carrie, it's Simon's.

26:20.468 --> 26:22.635
Wait. What?

26:22.637 --> 26:24.704
Maggie and I... we're not
anything but friends.

26:24.706 --> 26:26.339
She's just been going
through so much,

26:26.341 --> 26:28.307
and... and I wanted
to be there for her.

26:28.309 --> 26:32.578
So... you and Maggie
aren't... dating?

26:32.580 --> 26:33.746
No.

26:33.748 --> 26:35.548
Well, what about
when I came to your house

26:35.550 --> 26:38.050
with... with your jacket?
I...

26:38.052 --> 26:40.987
She was upset and needed
a place to crash. That's it.

26:43.091 --> 26:45.057
Why... why did you come
that night?

26:45.059 --> 26:47.393
I keep wondering.

26:50.465 --> 26:53.432
I just...
needed to see you...

26:56.536 --> 26:59.772
To tell you that I missed you.

26:59.774 --> 27:02.908
I miss you, too, so much...

27:04.044 --> 27:05.844
'Cause I love you.

27:12.352 --> 27:14.486
I love you, too.

27:16.690 --> 27:18.390
Bennet doesn't like to brag,
but I'm happy to.

27:18.392 --> 27:21.060
Tristan Cassidy of "Page Six"

27:21.062 --> 27:22.795
was just talking to him
about making a move,

27:22.797 --> 27:24.029
so if any of you
are interested...

27:24.031 --> 27:25.697
And you'd be crazy not to be...

27:25.699 --> 27:27.199
I would make one also.

27:29.103 --> 27:30.302
Very excited.

27:30.304 --> 27:32.004
Can't wait to sit down
with you guys.

27:32.006 --> 27:33.438
Thank you.

27:34.340 --> 27:37.009
Wow! Look at you, Bennet.

27:37.011 --> 27:38.377
Working it.

27:38.379 --> 27:40.979
It wasn't me. It was Walt.
He was amazing.

27:40.981 --> 27:43.415
What happened to peacocks
are beneath you?

27:43.417 --> 27:45.917
I guess I just got angry.

27:45.919 --> 27:47.653
When Larissa was so surprised
to see you here,

27:47.655 --> 27:49.521
it made me realize
they don't appreciate you.

27:49.523 --> 27:52.791
And I realized...
I don't either.

27:52.793 --> 27:53.959
Of course you do.

27:53.961 --> 27:57.129
No, I was thinking
about when I first met you

27:57.131 --> 27:59.164
and how I couldn't even
believe I was meeting the guy

27:59.166 --> 28:01.900
who wrote my favorite column,
"Hot Boîtes."

28:01.902 --> 28:05.871
It was so huge.
And I have to remember that.

28:05.873 --> 28:08.940
You're amazing, and I don't ever wanna take
you for granted.

28:08.942 --> 28:11.243
God, I love you.

28:11.245 --> 28:13.011
Aw.

28:13.013 --> 28:15.614
And I love that you were
a peacock for me.

28:15.616 --> 28:18.049
It was so sexy seeing you
strut your stuff.

28:21.421 --> 28:23.588
Okay, that's enough.
Now you're just making me sick,

28:23.590 --> 28:25.090
you're so happy.

28:29.996 --> 28:32.831
Carrie.
What is going on?

28:32.833 --> 28:34.299
Where is my baby?

28:34.301 --> 28:36.468
Mrs. Landers...
Mr. Landers?

28:36.470 --> 28:37.836
I'm Sebastian Kydd.

28:37.838 --> 28:39.904
Are you the bastard who took
advantage of my daughter?

28:39.906 --> 28:42.674
I've heard the stories about you
and your no-good father,

28:42.676 --> 28:44.309
using your money
to buy people off.

28:44.311 --> 28:45.810
Well, you're not
gonna buy me off.

28:45.812 --> 28:47.550
Mr. Landers, please, if you could
just listen...

28:47.670 --> 28:48.441
Carrie, don't.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.249
You are a lowlife,
getting my daughter pregnant?

28:51.251 --> 28:52.850
Putting her life at risk?

28:52.852 --> 28:54.252
I'm gonna put my fist
through your face.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.654
Eddie, now is not the time.
We need to find the doctor.

28:56.656 --> 28:59.190
And keeping us in the dark just
so you can cover your own hide?

28:59.192 --> 29:01.592
It's a good thing one
of the nurses who works here

29:01.594 --> 29:03.327
is married to one of my guys
and called us,

29:03.329 --> 29:06.264
did the right thing,
you coward, little punk!

29:06.266 --> 29:07.865
Look, Mr. Landers, I-I know
we're all upset, okay,

29:07.867 --> 29:11.068
but if you could please,
just take a breath.

29:11.070 --> 29:14.672
I have an update. Okay,
these are Maggie's parents.

29:14.674 --> 29:16.440
I'm Eddie Landers,
Chief of Police.

29:16.442 --> 29:17.708
This is my wife Brenda.

29:17.710 --> 29:20.478
It appears your daughter
has an ectopic pregnancy.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.879
What is that?

29:21.881 --> 29:23.447
It means the pregnancy took
in her fallopian tube

29:23.449 --> 29:24.749
instead of in the uterus.

29:24.751 --> 29:26.951
- You can fix it, right?
- She's hemorrhaging,

29:26.953 --> 29:28.419
so we need to operate
immediately,

29:28.421 --> 29:31.155
and it's a pretty long
and invasive surgery.

29:31.157 --> 29:34.158
Until we see how much damage
there is, she's at risk.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.359
How much risk?

29:35.361 --> 29:36.627
Life-threatening.

29:36.629 --> 29:40.531
Oh, my God. My baby.
Can we go see her?

29:40.533 --> 29:42.266
We're prepping her now
for the O.R.,

29:42.268 --> 29:45.770
but, uh, Sally
can take you back.

29:59.384 --> 30:01.551
Why didn't you tell
Maggie's parents the truth,

30:01.553 --> 30:03.686
that you're not the father?

30:03.688 --> 30:06.256
'Cause it's not my story
to tell. It's Maggie's.

30:06.258 --> 30:08.758
But she's in surgery,
fighting for her life.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.159
And she wouldn't want
her parents,

30:10.161 --> 30:12.295
especially her dad, to know
she was involved with Simon.

30:12.297 --> 30:13.529
I promised her.

30:13.531 --> 30:16.099
Do you not understand
what people will think of you?

30:16.101 --> 30:17.500
I know.

30:17.502 --> 30:19.335
But it's not the truth.

30:19.337 --> 30:21.037
I can't stop the rumors,
Carrie.

30:21.039 --> 30:26.275
But you can. I mean, all you
have to do is be honest.

30:26.277 --> 30:28.311
How are we supposed
to be together

30:28.313 --> 30:31.180
if everyone thinks
you knocked up my best friend?

30:31.182 --> 30:32.782
It's not about us right now.

30:32.784 --> 30:34.751
It's about Maggie,
and she needs us.

30:34.753 --> 30:36.452
But what will people think?

30:36.454 --> 30:38.020
I don't give a damn
what people think,

30:38.022 --> 30:40.189
and neither should you.

30:55.472 --> 30:57.239
What took you so long?

30:57.241 --> 30:58.641
I've been playing
a basketball game.

30:58.643 --> 30:59.842
We won, by the way.

30:59.844 --> 31:01.143
I know. I was watching.

31:01.145 --> 31:02.745
So you know I did great
with eight rebounds.

31:02.747 --> 31:05.247
Did you get the picture or not?

31:05.249 --> 31:08.084
I did, and thank you.

31:09.419 --> 31:12.254
So no one saw it.

31:12.256 --> 31:13.289
What a relief.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.758
Well... not exactly.

31:15.760 --> 31:16.926
What do you mean?

31:16.928 --> 31:19.128
Some people might have seen it.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.196
How many?

31:21.198 --> 31:22.932
The whole team.

31:24.635 --> 31:27.803
I can't breathe.

31:27.805 --> 31:30.172
I can't breathe. But no one
knew who it was. I promise.

31:30.174 --> 31:31.540
How do you <i>know?</i>

31:31.542 --> 31:33.008
Because everyone's
trying to guess who it was.

31:33.010 --> 31:34.143
Well, did they guess me?

31:34.145 --> 31:36.278
Nope.
Your name never came up.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.547
Are you sure?

31:38.549 --> 31:40.449
I need to hear exactly
what was said.

31:40.451 --> 31:42.151
I think Donna said something

31:42.153 --> 31:44.219
about how they were small
but very perky.

31:44.221 --> 31:47.723
Donna was there
in the locker room?

31:47.725 --> 31:49.291
She said my boobs were perky?

31:49.293 --> 31:52.027
And then they were like,
"maybe it was the Jens."

31:52.029 --> 31:54.029
So my name never came up?

31:54.031 --> 31:55.163
Never.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.832
Why?

31:56.834 --> 31:58.467
What do you mean?

31:58.469 --> 32:02.204
Well... do people not think
I could have perky boobs?

32:02.206 --> 32:03.739
Mouse, don't go there.

32:03.741 --> 32:05.507
Now I am just insulted.

32:09.812 --> 32:13.215
Hope everybody is ready.

32:13.217 --> 32:14.516
In a few minutes,
I will announce

32:14.518 --> 32:16.985
the winner of our trip
to Paris.

32:16.987 --> 32:19.321
Imagine if one of us
actually won.

32:19.323 --> 32:21.323
Ahh. I suddenly
realized if we did,

32:21.325 --> 32:23.658
I'd have no way of explaining
this to my parents.

32:23.660 --> 32:26.228
And I don't have a passport.

32:26.230 --> 32:27.696
Hey, guys.

32:27.698 --> 32:30.799
Carrie's not here.
She's gone.

32:30.801 --> 32:34.069
And your name's gonna be
all over the "Post" tomorrow.

32:34.071 --> 32:35.837
What did she say?

32:35.839 --> 32:38.673
Well, let's just say you might
see the word "diminutive" again,

32:38.675 --> 32:40.608
but this time in reference
to you

32:40.610 --> 32:42.410
and one of your body parts.

32:42.412 --> 32:44.279
But that's a lie.

32:44.281 --> 32:47.582
Like what <i>you</i> said
to "Page Six"?

32:47.584 --> 32:48.917
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

32:48.919 --> 32:51.886
They can't print stuff
about me that isn't true.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.188
Sure they can.

32:53.190 --> 32:54.856
They called you a "Wunderkind,"
didn't they?

32:56.726 --> 32:59.894
Andy heard you were being
sought after by several papers,

32:59.896 --> 33:01.262
and he wants it to stop.

33:01.264 --> 33:04.065
How did he know?

33:04.067 --> 33:06.701
He has eyes everywhere.
That's what makes him so...

33:06.703 --> 33:08.303
Scary?

33:08.305 --> 33:09.470
Is he angry?

33:09.472 --> 33:12.340
Andy's giving you a raise...

33:12.342 --> 33:15.476
and a promotion...
to features editor!

33:16.980 --> 33:18.513
Oh, my God.

33:18.515 --> 33:20.081
This is the best night of my life.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.051
Quiet down, everyone.

33:23.053 --> 33:24.719
Quiet down.

33:24.721 --> 33:26.554
We have a Paris winner.

33:26.556 --> 33:28.055
Please let it be me,
please let it be <i>moi.</i>

33:28.057 --> 33:30.591
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Carrie Bradshaw,

33:30.593 --> 33:34.729
grab your chapeau and head to
your waiting limo.

33:34.731 --> 33:36.797
You are leaving for Paris <i>anon.</i>

33:36.799 --> 33:40.501
She isn't here!
Why isn't she here?

33:40.503 --> 33:41.836
Carrie Bradshaw?

33:41.838 --> 33:44.805
Samantha, you should go.
We're all here because of you.

33:44.807 --> 33:46.140
Really?

33:46.142 --> 33:48.276
- Where are you, darling?
-  Carrie Bradshaw!

33:48.278 --> 33:50.044
She's right here!
Here she is!

33:50.046 --> 33:52.279
I'm Carrie!

33:52.281 --> 33:55.049
Carrie Bradshaw!

34:00.756 --> 34:02.289
Any word?

34:05.660 --> 34:08.062
<i>Dr. Kim,</i>
<i>you have a call on line 7.</i>

34:08.063 --> 34:12.166
<i>Dr. Kim, you have a call on line 7.</i>

34:12.168 --> 34:13.333
Look...

34:13.335 --> 34:16.603
I know people will hate me...

34:16.606 --> 34:21.141
and that...
I'm basically a pariah.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.745
But I don't care.

34:24.746 --> 34:27.447
The only thing I care about
is that you know the truth.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.315
The rumors,

34:29.318 --> 34:32.518
the gossip...
it's not real.

34:32.521 --> 34:34.355
That's just noise.

34:34.357 --> 34:36.690
<i>It was such a different</i>
<i>perspective from Weaver's,</i>

34:36.692 --> 34:38.826
<i>where perception</i>
<i>was everything.</i>

34:38.828 --> 34:41.795
But people will always
be looking at you...

34:41.797 --> 34:43.030
and judging.

34:43.032 --> 34:46.333
I know.
I can handle it.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.268
Question is... can you?

34:54.007 --> 34:56.543
Well?

35:00.652 --> 35:02.319
She made it through surgery.

35:02.439 --> 35:04.747
We couldn't save the fallopian
tube, but she's alive.

35:04.867 --> 35:05.556
Well, what does that mean?

35:05.558 --> 35:06.723
It means a future pregnancy

35:06.725 --> 35:08.412
will be a lot more difficult.

35:08.532 --> 35:12.197
- God. Does she know?
- Not yet.

35:12.317 --> 35:14.631
Well, can we see her?
She'll be groggy, but yes.

35:14.883 --> 35:17.050
- Okay, where are her parents?
- They're talking to the surgical team now,

35:17.052 --> 35:18.919
so you guys can head in.

35:25.960 --> 35:27.827
You comin'?

35:27.829 --> 35:30.897
Um... yeah. I just have
to do this one thing first.

35:30.899 --> 35:32.332
I'll meet you in there.

35:41.343 --> 35:43.176
- Hello?
- Larissa.

35:43.178 --> 35:44.110
It's me.

35:44.112 --> 35:46.146
Darling!
You should not have left.

35:46.148 --> 35:48.748
- You won the trip to Paris.
- I did?

35:48.750 --> 35:51.851
Samantha took it and went
with the busboy.

35:51.853 --> 35:54.988
Good for her...
and Alvaro.

35:56.224 --> 35:59.058
I've always wanted
to go to Paris.

35:59.060 --> 36:01.694
Oh, someday, <i>mon amie.</i>
Someday.

36:01.696 --> 36:04.564
Um, well, I-I know
you're busy,

36:04.566 --> 36:07.967
but I just wanted to know if
Tristan Cassidy is still there.

36:07.969 --> 36:09.402
I need to talk to him.

36:09.404 --> 36:11.604
Yeah, he's...
He's right here, my love.

36:16.211 --> 36:17.577
I'm sorry.
What is this all about?

36:17.579 --> 36:19.312
Oh, you're gonna wanna
chat with this one.

36:19.314 --> 36:20.947
She's got Los of dirt.

36:24.219 --> 36:25.251
Hello?

36:25.253 --> 36:28.521
Hi. Uh... this is the girl
who told you

36:28.523 --> 36:31.657
about Adam Weaver
and his penis size.

36:31.659 --> 36:33.192
Oh, right, Katja.

36:33.194 --> 36:35.227
Right. Katja.

36:35.229 --> 36:38.364
Um... well, the thing is,
that isn't really true...

36:38.366 --> 36:39.932
About his manhood.

36:39.934 --> 36:42.601
And I don't think it would be
fair to have a lie out there,

36:42.603 --> 36:43.703
even though
it wouldn't kill Weaver

36:43.705 --> 36:45.905
to have a dose
of his own medicine.

36:45.907 --> 36:47.006
Oh, it's too late, kiddo.

36:47.008 --> 36:48.240
I already called it in.

36:48.242 --> 36:50.509
And if I don't print that,
I've got nothing.

36:50.511 --> 36:52.178
But it's not true.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.779
Well, it's not <i>untrue.</i>

36:53.781 --> 36:56.715
Yes, it is. That's what
"not true" means.

36:58.218 --> 37:00.486
What if I were
to give you something else?

37:00.488 --> 37:01.554
Like what?

37:01.556 --> 37:02.655
Like the name

37:02.657 --> 37:05.824
of Weaver's
diminutive, suburban poseur.

37:05.826 --> 37:08.060
You know who it is?

37:08.062 --> 37:09.628
Yeah.

37:09.630 --> 37:12.431
It's me.
Carrie Bradshaw.

37:12.433 --> 37:14.400
I thought your name was Katja.

37:14.402 --> 37:15.567
Well, I lied.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.169
Well, how do I know

37:17.171 --> 37:18.504
you're telling the truth, then?

37:18.506 --> 37:20.939
Didn't you see how tiny I am?

37:20.941 --> 37:24.009
That's a good point.

37:24.011 --> 37:25.644
All right,
I'm gonna go with it.

37:25.646 --> 37:27.713
Okay. Good.

37:27.715 --> 37:28.747
But I gotta ask you,

37:28.749 --> 37:30.716
why the hell
are you giving yourself up?

37:30.718 --> 37:35.287
At the end of the day,
it's just words.

37:39.659 --> 37:41.326
<i>I had to give myself up,</i>

37:41.328 --> 37:44.863
<i>but it was worth it to know</i>
<i>I didn't sell someone else out</i>

37:44.865 --> 37:46.798
<i>to save my own skin.</i>

37:51.838 --> 37:53.405
Hi.

37:53.407 --> 37:55.040
Hi.

37:55.042 --> 37:57.709
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

37:57.711 --> 38:00.112
It's more than okay.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.553
I'm so sorry, Mags.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.490
I'm here for you, always.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.326
Whatever you need.

38:18.598 --> 38:20.365
Right now I would...
just love it

38:20.367 --> 38:24.202
if you guys would sit here
with me.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.687
Hello, boys.

38:44.024 --> 38:45.990
Whoa.
That's right.

38:45.992 --> 38:47.825
They're <i>mine.</i>

38:53.600 --> 38:54.666
That's my girl.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.401
Look at <i>you,</i> dude.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.515
There are so many soirees
now in the city.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.583
It's hard to keep up.

39:12.585 --> 39:15.520
I know. Every week
a different charity event.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.755
They wrote about one last night

39:17.757 --> 39:20.124
where someone won a trip
to Paris.

39:20.126 --> 39:22.527
Isn't that gauche?

39:22.529 --> 39:26.664
These events should be
to give back, not to take.

39:26.666 --> 39:29.567
