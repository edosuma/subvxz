- It's this weekend.
- Uh-huh. And how much does it cost?

02:08.026 --> 02:11.053
- Um, it's free.
- I see. And when is it?

- Come on, Dad. The team's arriving.
- It's free, right?

02:21.007 --> 02:26.001

- Who cares what it is?

The point is these are some decent, generous
people that I can take advantage of.

02:58.311 --> 03:02.441
- But what if they try to talk us into something?
- Marge, Marge, Marge.

Thank God the check bounced.
- So I beat the system.

- Beer is not allowed.

Homer no function beer well without.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.470
Would you rather have beer
or complete and utter contentment?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.474
What kind of beer?

04:03.576 --> 04:07.706
The Leader knows how miserable
you, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie are.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.748
Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.

04:09.849 --> 04:13.307

- All I had to give them...

07:39.358 --> 07:41.485
was our life savings,

of 10 trillion years of labor.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.660
I can't go along with this, Homer.

- Homer!
- What? What did I say?

07:58.945 --> 08:02.176
Church, cult. Cult, church. So we get bored
someplace else every Sunday.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.444
- Does this really change our day-to-day lives?
- Of course not-

08:05.551 --> 08:08.486
except that we're all moving to
the Movementarian agricultural compound...

08:08.588 --> 08:11.421

And it didn't cost us a dime.

08:20.666 --> 08:24.432

08:35.347 --> 08:40.149
Excuse my editorial laugh.
[Laughs] But-

08:40.253 --> 08:43.745
Ladies and gentlemen, I've just learned of

08:59.272 --> 09:02.708
- Then something might open up in a double.
- [Chuckles] Why even unpack?

09:02.808 --> 09:05.003
- [Groans]
- Dad and all these other people...

09:05.111 --> 09:07.705
are obviously the products
of mental conditioning.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.680
Yeah. Maybe it'll wear off,
like his interest in C.B. radio.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.683
That's a negatory, good buddy!

09:12.785 --> 09:15.754
I kind of think it's cool.
Just pretend you're in a zombie movie.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.789
Besides, this is just
another place...

09:17.890 --> 09:20.688

of hysterical havoc.

09:20.793 --> 09:24.456

09:31.637 --> 09:34.538
I love the Leader.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.040
Of course you do.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.703
<i>This so-called "new religion"...</i>

09:39.812 --> 09:43.407

weird rituals and chants...

09:43.516 --> 09:46.485
designed to take away
the money of fools.

09:46.586 --> 09:52.115
Let us say the Lord's Prayer 40 times,
but first let's pass the collection plate.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.489

09:55.595 --> 09:59.361
Oh, Lord. Uh, try

09:59.465 --> 10:02.593

- Um-

See, Marge?
Our lives are so much better now.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.098
You two, stop talking and resume
the lima bean harvest.

10:10.209 --> 10:13.201

Oh, boy.
We get to see the Leader pass by.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.994
We toil in the fields,
and he rides around in a Rolls-Royce?

10:34.100 --> 10:37.331
Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American,
but what are you gonna do?

10:39.672 --> 10:42.800
I'm covered in the dust
of the Leader. He favors me!

10:42.908 --> 10:46.105
I am even dustier.
Dustier than thou!

10:49.682 --> 10:52.446
Oh, look who the new pet is.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.712
I've never been so happy.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.586
<i>Smithers, why haven't I heard</i>
<i>of this "the Leader"?</i>

10:58.691 --> 11:02.559
He's as rich and wicked as I,
but he seems to enjoy tax-exempt status.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.222
[Chuckles]
Actually, sir, with our creative bookkeeping...

11:05.331 --> 11:07.663
and corporate loopholes,
we only pay three dollars a year.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.565
[Gasps]
You're right. We're getting screwed.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.571
There must be
something I can do about this.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.834
Wait. Yes.

11:15.941 --> 11:18.102
I think I know just the thing.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.509
[Cackling]

11:25.317 --> 11:29.879
Uh, sir? You have to tell me what your plan is,
or- or nothing will happen.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.923
Oh, yes. Of course.
The plan.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.084
- You see me as a god, right, Smithers?
- Absolutely, sir.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.890
- You'd kneel before me.
- Boy, would I!

11:37.997 --> 11:42.434
Yes. Uh, then I'll form my own religion
with its own symbol.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.765
We'll use this special "K."

11:44.870 --> 11:47.270
I believe that's already
a breakfast cereal, sir.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.341
- And people worship it?
- In a way.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.002
All right then.
Uh, how about this?

11:52.111 --> 11:54.477
Uh, why don't you leave
the symbol to me, sir?

12:10.663 --> 12:13.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
behold your new god...

12:13.999 --> 12:15.967
Mr. Burns.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.539
- [All Gasp]
- Ahoy-hoy, lowly mortals.

12:21.640 --> 12:26.475
In addition to working for me,
you may now praise me as your Almighty.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.047
Amen, sir. Mmm!

12:32.184 --> 12:34.152
[Groaning]

12:37.189 --> 12:38.315
[Screams]

12:38.424 --> 12:41.587
Uh, we'll try this again tomorrow.

12:41.694 --> 12:45.027
Ah, he's all right.
But he's no bowl of Special "K."

12:46.332 --> 12:48.323
This is ridiculous.
We're already married.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.925
But, Marge, we're not mass married.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.640
At least you
got to choose your mate.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.005
We got matched up on the printout.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.944
- Hey. Remember our agreement. I'm the man.
- You're the man!

13:02.047 --> 13:05.881
- I could have done a lot worse, Mother.
- Speak for yourself.

13:05.985 --> 13:10.081
So, do you enjoy comic books?

13:10.189 --> 13:13.625
And who can tell me where thunder
and lightning come from?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.250
Yes, Bart?

13:15.361 --> 13:16.760
The Leader, ma'am.

13:16.862 --> 13:20.559
Very good, Bart.
And who invented Morse code?

13:20.666 --> 13:23.134
Oh. I should know this one.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.169
The-The Leader?

13:25.271 --> 13:26.932
Ah. Correct again.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.836
He's wrong!
You're wrong!

13:28.941 --> 13:33.207
The whole damn system is wrong!
[Screams]

13:33.312 --> 13:35.872
What's the matter, Lisa?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.245
You used to be such a good student.

13:38.350 --> 13:42.184
Don't you want to please your teachers
and get good grades?

13:42.288 --> 13:44.950
[Sighs]
Grades?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.254
<i>##[Singing]</i>

13:48.360 --> 13:51.523
## [Ends]

13:51.630 --> 13:56.067
These lima beans are even better
than the ones we had for breakfast and lunch.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.569
Oh! A lima bean that looks
just like the Leader!

13:59.672 --> 14:02.732
- I'll put it with the others.
- <i>Homer...</i>

14:02.842 --> 14:05.606
you know I always try to put
the best face on everything...

14:05.711 --> 14:07.679
but there's no face
on that damn bean!

14:07.780 --> 14:10.442
We hate it here!
And your family wants to leave.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.517
<i>[Bart & Lisa]</i>
<i>No, we don't, Mother.</i>

14:12.618 --> 14:15.178
We love the Leader.

14:17.122 --> 14:20.114
No!

14:21.827 --> 14:24.387
All righty.
Time for bed.

14:24.496 --> 14:28.296
I'm leaving this place,
and you'd better step aside.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.062
Lady, people are free to go
whenever they wish.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.366
- [Growling]
- [Barking]

14:42.715 --> 14:45.115
Hi-yah!

14:45.217 --> 14:46.707
<i>[Barking]</i>

15:00.933 --> 15:02.992
[Screaming]

15:09.408 --> 15:13.139
Oh. I never thought
I'd have to do this again.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.611
[Panting]
Reverend Lovejoy!

15:15.714 --> 15:18.148
[Coughs]
You've gotta help me.

15:18.250 --> 15:22.050
My entire family has been taken in
by the evil Movementarians.

15:22.154 --> 15:26.648
Oh, I feel for you, my child,
and I'd like to help you.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.057
[Clears Throat]

15:29.161 --> 15:31.129
[Groans]

15:31.230 --> 15:33.721
- <i>[Clinks]</i>
- Now, how are we going to get my Homie back?

15:33.832 --> 15:36.926
- [Scraping]
- I'll kidnap him for 50...

15:37.036 --> 15:40.938
deprogram him for 100,
and I'll kill him for 500.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.974
No, no, no.
Just the first two.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.134
All right. I'll throw in
the killir for free.

15:45.244 --> 15:49.374
- <i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>
- [Together] Yea! Here comes the Leader!

15:54.386 --> 15:57.549
What an honor.
We've been called into the presence of-

15:59.758 --> 16:02.056
Marge? You're the Leader?

16:02.161 --> 16:04.129
You don't look anything
like the beans.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.460
- Knock him out, Reverend!
- Ow! Ooh!

16:07.566 --> 16:11.332
- Ow!
- Oh, the devil has given him superhuman strength.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.031
Give me that,
you noodle-armed choir boy!

16:14.139 --> 16:17.267
- Ow!
- Well, that didn't do it, Mr. Kilt.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.571
Look. Let's the three of us
try it together.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.908
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

16:22.014 --> 16:23.709
<i>Oh! Ooh! Why?</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:31.017
Oh, you're gonna break like matchsticks.
I promise you that!

16:31.123 --> 16:34.559
Hey. I made some Rice Krispie squares
for our hungry deprogrammerinos.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.960
Aw, man! You ruined
the atmosphere, ya daft pansy!

16:39.064 --> 16:41.123
Well, this is my rumpus room.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.633
Ach! Don't call it that!

16:46.438 --> 16:48.372
Outsiders have kidnapped
some of our property.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.442
We must respond with
our deadliest weapon.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.032
The lawyers.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.135
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- Go! Go! Go!

16:54.246 --> 16:55.440
[Chattering]

16:55.547 --> 16:58.914
[Siren Wailing]

16:59.018 --> 17:00.918
Attention, all citizens.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.818
- Even though the Leader himself
is completely nonviolent-
- <i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

17:03.922 --> 17:07.016
he urges you to be as violent as you like
in capturing the Simpsons.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.094
- <i>[Sirens Stop]</i>
- <i>[Tires Screech]</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:11.958
[Chattering]

17:12.064 --> 17:15.295
What are you doing?
They're not here, you idiots!

17:15.401 --> 17:18.029
Idiots? That's slander, sir,
and we have it on tape.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.401
All right. I'll get out my checkbook.
[Grumbles]

17:20.506 --> 17:22.497
- What was that?
- Ah, I said- [Grumbles]

17:22.608 --> 17:25.474
So, you kids really
love the Leader, huh?

17:25.577 --> 17:27.511
Even more than your parents?

17:27.613 --> 17:29.604
- Yeah. No contest.
- Of course. Absolutely.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.809
All right already.
But do you love the Leader...

17:32.918 --> 17:37.719
more than having your
very own brand-new hover bikes?

17:37.823 --> 17:40.792
- <i>[Humming]</i>
- [Both Gasp]

17:40.893 --> 17:43.418
What do you have to say
about the Leader now, huh? Huh?

17:43.529 --> 17:46.089
- What Leader?
- The hell with him. He can taking a flying leap.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.792
- And who do you love now?
- [Together] Hover bikes!

17:48.901 --> 17:50.391
[Groans]
Close enough.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.904
[Both]
Yea!

17:55.107 --> 17:57.302
- [All Groan]
- [Laughs]

17:57.409 --> 17:59.900
Sorry, kids.
There's no such thing as hover bikes.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.173
They're just a couple of
Huffys on a fishing line.

18:02.281 --> 18:06.513
- But we heard them hovering.
- Oh, I'm afraid I played a dirty
part in this little charade.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.245
[Humming]

18:08.353 --> 18:11.413
- Well, can we at least keep the bikes?
- Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no.

18:11.523 --> 18:14.959
They're due back at the store by 6:00.
Get off'em. Get off. Off. Get off.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.960
All right.

18:17.062 --> 18:21.522
Now, what's so all-fire great
about your fancy-pants Leader?

18:21.633 --> 18:25.091
The Leader knows all and sees all.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.672
Ooh. Well, that is impressive.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.901
And he's going to take us
to a wonderful new planet.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.775
Oh, this Leader-
He sounds like a grand fella.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.144
Willie, I'm not sure
we're making any headway here.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.615
Would you shut up, woman.
He's talking about my leader.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.278
<i>Uh, maybe we should take</i>
<i>a little break-a-rooney, huh?</i>

18:42.387 --> 18:44.514
Anyone like a draft beer?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.421
Beer?
[Salivating]

18:47.526 --> 18:51.121
Would you like
a tall, frosty one, Homer?

18:56.468 --> 19:00.097
[Thinking]
No. Must resist temptation.

19:00.205 --> 19:04.801
[Thinking]
Go ahead. Give in. Beer! Beer!

19:04.910 --> 19:08.209
[Thinking]
Ooh. These cotton-poly blends are so comfortable.

19:08.313 --> 19:12.477
Go on, Homer. Our commandments
clearly state that beer is all right.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.745
Try some.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.982
[Chattering]

19:21.627 --> 19:24.494
- This man is coming with us.
- <i>Homer, you don't have to go with them.</i>

19:24.596 --> 19:26.427
But I want to go.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.500
Well, I would say
the matter is settled.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.468
You know, I pride myself on being a good host,
so I'm obliged to offer you a beer...

19:32.571 --> 19:36.598
but I'm so darn mad
it's gonna be mostly head.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.414
Homer, come back!

19:43.515 --> 19:46.643
- That's my husband!
- He's our husband now.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.118
[All]
Yea!

19:49.221 --> 19:51.655
I'm glad I'm back...

19:51.757 --> 19:54.624
because the moment
that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue...

19:54.726 --> 19:56.557
I was born again!

19:56.662 --> 19:58.960
- [Both Gasp]
- Hallelujah!

19:59.064 --> 20:02.295
Now I can show all of you
what I've come to realize.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.767
The reason we're not allowed
in the forbidden barn...

20:04.870 --> 20:07.703
is because there is no
intergalactic spaceship.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.707
He's taken our money
just so he can...

20:11.743 --> 20:14.439
build one hell of a spaceship!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.811
- [All Gasping]
- [Leader On Speaker] Homer Simpson...

20:17.916 --> 20:23.786
because of your lack of faith,
you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.823
- Whoops.
- <i>Nice goir there, Homer.</i>

20:25.924 --> 20:28.950
Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was
telling the truth about everything.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.723
Oh, mercy.
He's the real deal!

20:40.105 --> 20:42.096
[Humming]

20:44.343 --> 20:46.368
[All Groan]

20:46.478 --> 20:48.378
Come back.
Come back!

20:48.480 --> 20:50.710
Willie still loves ya, O Great One!

20:58.223 --> 21:01.715
Stranger, you're a-trespassir
on my dirt farm.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.694
Uh, do you happen to need a messiah?

21:04.796 --> 21:07.788
No, but I'll take
them sacks of money from ya.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.799
[Groans]

21:09.901 --> 21:12.995
I should have stayed
with the Promise Keepers.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.802
Damn it! It fell apart
like everything else I've ever believed in.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.399
Oh, I guess it's back to
good old-fashioned voodoo.

21:20.512 --> 21:23.140
Wow! I need a drink!

21:23.248 --> 21:25.307
Come with me.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.408
Uh, is that your collar, Reverend?

21:27.519 --> 21:31.250
Uh, yes. [Chuckles]
How did that get down there?

21:31.356 --> 21:34.416
Come back to papa, baby.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.054
To think, I turned to a cult
for mindless happiness...

21:39.164 --> 21:42.156
- when I had beer all along.
- [Clears Throat]

21:42.267 --> 21:46.067
And you, Marge, the bringer of beer.

21:46.171 --> 21:50.107
- It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
- You said it, Sister.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.835
[Man Announcing]
You are watching Fox.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.912
[Together]
We are watching Fox.
