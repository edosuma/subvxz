Jesus. Y-You make
a report of her?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.450
Just... nutcase insurance?

21:15.650 --> 21:17.630
I thought about it, but...

21:17.830 --> 21:20.810
Ultimately, I didn't, I...
[sighs]

21:21.000 --> 21:22.760
You know what a gossip mill
this building is.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.770
A-And I was hoping that she
would just come to her senses.

21:24.970 --> 21:26.250
You know, I didn't want
to end her career.

21:26.450 --> 21:27.550
But now with this...

21:27.750 --> 21:29.340
Well, no good deed
unpunished, huh?

21:29.540 --> 21:30.510
Yeah. Right?

21:30.710 --> 21:31.510
What a fucking mess.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.600
Well, uh, the good news is,

21:33.800 --> 21:36.130
uh, her complaint
was pretty specific.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.600
You showed up at
her place last night,

21:37.800 --> 21:39.680
you came in, you assaulted her.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.040
But till last night,
where you really were was...

21:45.390 --> 21:46.790
At home, with my family.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.920
Yeah. [sniffs]

21:49.120 --> 21:51.050
This woman needs help, Earl.

21:51.250 --> 21:54.530
It's... It'd be sad
if it wasn't so terrifying

21:54.730 --> 21:55.750
how delusional she is.

21:55.950 --> 21:58.050
I don't even know
where she lives.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.630
This...

22:10.930 --> 22:12.980
...is some messy shit.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.770
Yeah, obviously.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.870
But she's lying.

22:21.060 --> 22:24.120
So, just let me know
what else you need from me.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.570
Yeah, I need to...

22:28.770 --> 22:30.310
figure out what to do
about how your prints

22:30.510 --> 22:33.790
are all over her place,
you don't even know where it is.

22:33.990 --> 22:36.100
All over a bathroom sink,

22:36.300 --> 22:39.620
kitchen, bedframe,
that you say you've never seen.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.620
It's a fucking conundrum.

22:42.790 --> 22:43.980
Or is it?

22:44.170 --> 22:46.800
She is a fucking psycho, Earl.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.760
You go brace her, I promise you
her story won't hold up.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.550
Just talk to her for ten minutes
and you will understand.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.720
I would if I could,
but she's dead.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.410
What?

23:05.550 --> 23:06.650
Where is the body?

23:06.850 --> 23:08.820
I was hoping you would tell me.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.310
Earl, you don't know
the kind of person

23:13.510 --> 23:14.700
that we're dealing with here.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.360
Okay? Sh--

23:16.560 --> 23:18.050
She broke into my home.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.190
I'm pretty sure that she
had something to do with

23:20.380 --> 23:21.320
my mother-in-law's death,

23:21.520 --> 23:22.710
and she took my fucking kid,

23:22.910 --> 23:24.830
she kidnapped her
right off the bus.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.450
[scoffs]

23:30.060 --> 23:31.490
The Rubidoh case.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.160
I told her about
Sylvia Rubidoh, I told--

23:35.360 --> 23:37.160
I told her that
I couldn't charge the case

23:37.360 --> 23:38.990
because I didn't have the body

23:39.190 --> 23:42.560
and I was worried that the
victim was gonna walking in...

23:42.760 --> 23:44.080
She is fucking with me.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.600
Do you see that?
This is what she does.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.770
She's fucking with me.
It's like a game for her.

23:49.810 --> 23:51.430
[sighs]

23:51.630 --> 23:53.390
You're saying this whole thing's
a frame-up?

23:53.590 --> 23:55.430
She's framing you,
t-that's what you're saying?

24:00.520 --> 24:01.660
So I guess you're
not gonna tell me

24:01.860 --> 24:04.050
where you put her at, huh?

24:05.920 --> 24:08.270
[sighs]

24:09.490 --> 24:11.370
Okay.

24:11.570 --> 24:13.360
So here's what's gonna happen.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.850
I'm gonna find her body.

24:18.050 --> 24:21.020
And then I'm gonna put you
under the prison. Okay?

24:24.980 --> 24:27.160
Y-You got nothing to say now?

24:28.330 --> 24:30.250
See, that's not like you.

24:31.550 --> 24:34.030
You always got something to say.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.830
<i>MARCELLA:</i>
<i>Okay, what is it?</i>

24:38.030 --> 24:40.740
I don't even know how to
say this to you, Marcella.

24:41.870 --> 24:43.140
A woman is missing.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.970
Alexandra Forrest is missing
and Earl Brooker

24:46.170 --> 24:47.490
presumes that she's dead.

24:47.690 --> 24:48.750
And he thinks that I had
something to do with it.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.840
Oh, Jesus, okay.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.020
I know, I know, but
I need you to-to...

24:52.220 --> 24:54.580
call RHD and...

24:56.010 --> 24:57.590
What's his boss's name?
I'm blanking on the name.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.150
- Hailey.
- Yes. Hailey.

24:59.350 --> 25:00.680
So, I need you to call Hailey.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.160
This is a flex.
Earl is fucking with me.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.770
And you, because you're my boss.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.420
He's so obsessed with
all the power moves

25:07.620 --> 25:08.860
that everybody else is making,

25:09.060 --> 25:09.990
he's trying to make
a power move on us.

25:10.190 --> 25:14.430
Okay, well, let me just, uh...

25:14.630 --> 25:18.030
catch up with you here, um...

25:19.300 --> 25:22.220
Okay. Alexandra Forrest.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.660
I'm only asking so I know.

25:23.860 --> 25:26.360
Is the Alex Forrest
who vouched for you

25:26.550 --> 25:28.040
when Jeanette Ruiz
was looking into...

25:29.260 --> 25:30.660
Okay.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.840
Is there any more context
to all that?

25:33.040 --> 25:34.230
Something I should know?

25:34.430 --> 25:35.890
No.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.020
Well, just in light of what
you're saying now,

25:38.220 --> 25:40.240
because this...

25:40.440 --> 25:42.850
[sighs] It's a very long limb
I'm about to go out on for you.

25:43.050 --> 25:44.840
I know. I know.

25:46.150 --> 25:47.680
You also know that
I am your friend,

25:47.880 --> 25:50.730
who's gonna do everything
I can for you.

25:50.930 --> 25:52.370
Which is a lot.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.340
Okay?

25:55.540 --> 25:58.780
All right, LAPD.
It's its own thing.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.690
So I'm gonna need as much
information as I can get, right?

26:01.890 --> 26:05.180
Because if they know
more than I do going in,

26:05.380 --> 26:06.700
I'll be fucked.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.830
So, I just want to ask
those questions that

26:09.030 --> 26:11.050
I already have the answers to.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.710
So, Dan, please...

26:12.910 --> 26:15.000
Okay?

26:16.960 --> 26:18.570
Did you?

26:20.230 --> 26:22.020
Were you...

26:22.220 --> 26:24.400
involved with her, at all?

26:25.800 --> 26:27.840
With Alex Forrest.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.630
Oh, my God.

26:38.110 --> 26:40.460
What's the matter?

26:41.730 --> 26:44.080
How could you do this to me?

26:45.690 --> 26:49.080
How could you think
that I'm involved in this?

26:53.430 --> 26:56.010
- [Dan sighs]
- [line beeps]

26:56.210 --> 26:57.790
[Dan scoffs]

26:57.990 --> 27:00.090
[door opens]

27:03.830 --> 27:05.540
MARCELLA: Don't forget
to keep your housekeys.

27:05.740 --> 27:08.140
They're gonna need your cell.

27:09.230 --> 27:12.060
You're not going
back into your office.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.640
You're going to need
to get somebody

27:14.840 --> 27:16.470
to pick up your stuff for you.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.810
But not today.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.430
<i>BETH: What does that even mean?</i>
<i>Missing from where?</i>

27:23.630 --> 27:25.740
<i>DAN: Can't talk about this</i>
<i>on the phone, okay?</i>

27:25.930 --> 27:27.480
Not even on my personal phone.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.090
- This is not a good idea.
<i>- BETH: Where are you now?</i>

27:29.290 --> 27:31.000
Downtown.
They took my fucking car.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.870
<i>Okay, tell me where you are.</i>
<i>I'll come get you.</i>

27:33.070 --> 27:34.790
Going to Beatrice Alba's.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.180
Her office is walking distance.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.220
<i>Who's that?</i>

27:37.420 --> 27:38.750
Criminal defense attorney.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.230
Should've called her right away.

27:40.430 --> 27:41.840
<i>- Dan?</i>
- Yeah?

27:42.040 --> 27:43.580
<i>Text me the address</i>
<i>and I'll meet you there.</i>

27:43.780 --> 27:44.830
Okay.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.540
I am so sorry you
had to wait, Dan.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.890
My God, can some people
not tell a story, right?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.070
[chuckling]

27:57.270 --> 27:59.730
Jesus. Are you okay?

27:59.930 --> 28:00.730
What's going on?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.470
I'm fucked, Bea.

28:02.670 --> 28:03.990
I don't even know
where to start,

28:04.190 --> 28:05.210
but I'm gonna need the best.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.640
R-Representation? You are?

28:08.810 --> 28:11.820
Uh, okay.

28:12.020 --> 28:14.600
Tell me. No bullshit. Go.

28:16.990 --> 28:19.960
A woman that I work with
has gone missing.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.530
Her name is Alexandra Forrest.

28:21.730 --> 28:22.920
We worked on a couple
of cases together,

28:23.120 --> 28:24.450
she was in Victim Services,

28:24.650 --> 28:26.400
she became fixated on me,

28:26.600 --> 28:29.320
I asked her to back off,
then I told her to back off,

28:29.520 --> 28:31.410
she couldn't do it,
there's some... some...

28:31.610 --> 28:32.930
mental health issues there.

28:33.130 --> 28:34.190
And now she's missing and
they think I'm the guy...

28:34.390 --> 28:35.890
- Oh, Dan, good Lord.
- I-I know.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.980
I told you, I'm fucked here.
But, look,

28:38.180 --> 28:39.420
she is way out there.

28:39.620 --> 28:40.420
All right?
S-She's completely delusional.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.900
You won't even have to try

28:42.100 --> 28:43.860
- to make her look unreliable.
- No, I know.

28:44.060 --> 28:45.470
- I know.
- But I'm gonna need the best
with me here, please.

28:45.670 --> 28:49.030
Don't say anything else. Okay?

28:50.420 --> 28:52.820
This is not for me.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.820
Beatrice,
this is perfect for you.

28:55.020 --> 28:55.910
- Please.
- No.

28:56.110 --> 28:56.960
We have a history together.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.050
No, I mean I don't want it.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.530
I know, I used to take
these kinds of cases

29:02.730 --> 29:05.530
and I did it so that someday
I wouldn't have to do it.

29:05.730 --> 29:07.750
And then someday came.

29:07.950 --> 29:11.410
I don't need to go after
the victims anymore, so I don't.

29:11.610 --> 29:13.020
This is...

29:13.220 --> 29:15.850
serious shit you're in, Dan.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.200
You need to put a killer
on the road right now.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.020
You need someone that
will trash the victims.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.290
And likes it.

29:22.490 --> 29:24.070
[phone buzzing]

29:24.270 --> 29:25.980
You want names?

29:35.810 --> 29:37.990
[indistinct chatter]

29:41.640 --> 29:43.920
Hey. Is chagaccino
the thing that you said

29:44.120 --> 29:45.440
was mushroom coffee?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.400
Yeah, that I hate but you
would probably like?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.830
[sniffs]

29:49.870 --> 29:51.490
Oh, shit, a-are you okay?

29:51.690 --> 29:53.530
He ended it.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.620
Out of nowhere.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.060
Said that...

29:59.260 --> 30:01.280
he had been worried for a while,

30:01.480 --> 30:04.200
that we were taking
too many risks,

30:04.400 --> 30:07.940
that the way he felt
was making him forget

30:08.140 --> 30:10.640
that what we were doing
was dangerous.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.020
Out of nowhere. Just... boom.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.990
I'm really sorry.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.550
Yeah, me too.

30:23.340 --> 30:24.740
<i>OLENA:</i>
<i>She was my advocate.</i>

30:24.940 --> 30:26.220
Years ago, I had drug case.

30:26.420 --> 30:27.870
Before my children.

30:28.070 --> 30:30.080
Okay, but just through
the courts then, right?

30:32.520 --> 30:34.050
Well, so how...?
Why would your fingerprints

30:34.250 --> 30:35.480
be in her apartment?

30:36.830 --> 30:38.440
[sighs]

30:40.010 --> 30:42.140
I had drug case,
but also there was Artem.

30:43.310 --> 30:45.060
My boyfriend was Artem.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.410
He had a delivery service.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.900
He would get calls for pills,
or I would drive over

30:50.100 --> 30:51.330
what the people wanted.

30:51.530 --> 30:55.990
He was jealous,
very angry always, Artem.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.210
Put me in hospital once.

30:57.410 --> 30:59.120
- I had to have operation.
- Ooh.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.990
She wanted me to get away. Alex.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.390
If I wanted,
she told me she would help.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.740
And did you?
I mean, did she?

31:05.940 --> 31:08.090
She had said she could get
emergency placement,

31:08.290 --> 31:10.130
but she called and all of them
are telling her

31:10.330 --> 31:11.960
to check back, check back.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.960
Busy weekend, hot weather.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.830
I'm waiting in a diner
while she's trying,

31:16.030 --> 31:19.840
but there's nothing, so she just
took me home, to her home.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.410
And did you end up staying
with her? For how long?

31:22.610 --> 31:25.190
She had to go to work
next morning,

31:25.390 --> 31:27.190
but she's still calling
the places for me.

31:27.390 --> 31:29.370
I said, "I'll go to
my cousin's to wait,"

31:29.570 --> 31:33.940
- but I went back to Artem.
- Mm.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.550
But it wasn't her fault.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.550
Was she angry?

31:37.750 --> 31:42.380
For not being able to help when
she promised me she would? Yes.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.690
Angry at me for going back?
No. Never.

31:44.890 --> 31:47.610
Or not that she showed.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.480
- She was always kind with me.
- [girl squeals]

31:50.680 --> 31:53.180
But so that's
how the fingerprint...

31:53.380 --> 31:54.610
- [kids shouting]
- Sorry.

31:54.810 --> 31:55.830
I've just got to see
what they're doing

31:56.030 --> 31:56.960
- to each other this time.
- Okay.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.780
Ugh!

32:03.260 --> 32:05.610
[phone chiming]

32:08.570 --> 32:11.240
Oh, you know, the people
that say you're slow

32:11.440 --> 32:12.630
and inefficient don't know you
like I do, Dawn.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.630
<i>DAWN:</i>
<i>Wait, who says that?</i>

32:14.830 --> 32:16.810
<i>Goddamn you, Mikey!</i>

32:17.010 --> 32:18.330
<i>You ready for what I found you</i>
<i>on Elijah Acosta,</i>

32:18.530 --> 32:19.590
<i>or are you ready?</i>

32:19.790 --> 32:22.730
Ready as a porcupine
for winter.

32:22.930 --> 32:25.030
<i>Also, before I forget,</i>
<i>you heard Judge Mills</i>

32:25.230 --> 32:26.300
<i>is retiring?</i>

32:26.500 --> 32:28.120
<i>Rackets tomorrow at 3:00.</i>

32:28.320 --> 32:29.870
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>there's gonna be people there</i>

32:30.060 --> 32:31.740
<i>- who would love to see you.</i>
- Of course there are.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.950
But the question is why?

32:36.170 --> 32:39.140
Meatball, Italian,
grilled cheese, patty melt,

32:39.330 --> 32:40.830
tortas, panini, anything,
classy PB&J.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.050
DAN: I know what
sandwiches are, Mike.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.660
Eat in, take out,
12 hours a day,

32:43.860 --> 32:45.320
seven days a week.

32:45.510 --> 32:46.800
One night somebody beats him
to death in there.

32:46.990 --> 32:48.450
Right?

32:48.650 --> 32:50.490
Elijah is the son.
They iris in on him

32:50.690 --> 32:52.890
pretty quick, they charge him,
case goes to grand jury.

32:53.090 --> 32:56.500
Grand jury returns no true bill.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.240
- Wow.
- Yeah.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.850
Fuckin' moonwalks out.

33:00.050 --> 33:02.290
Probably thinks,
from a technical standpoint,

33:02.490 --> 33:04.200
it's like the whole thing
never happened.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.680
[door lock buzzes]

33:09.550 --> 33:11.300
[dance music playing]

33:11.500 --> 33:15.610
Fuck, I've put a lot of people
in a lot of prison... for this?

33:15.810 --> 33:17.430
I'm having--
what do you call it?--

33:17.630 --> 33:19.040
like a cognitive dissonance.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.480
Yeah. It was the law,

33:21.680 --> 33:23.350
and then all of a sudden
it just wasn't.

33:23.550 --> 33:24.830
- Yeah.
- Right? That's fucked up.

33:25.030 --> 33:29.050
Hi, buddies.
Do we need recommendations?

33:29.250 --> 33:31.490
Actually, we were hoping
to talk to Elijah.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.480
HOSTESS:
Well, that's him over there.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.240
How you fellas doing?

33:39.440 --> 33:43.240
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about Alex Forrest.

33:43.440 --> 33:47.200
Oh, never heard of it.
Are you guys growers or...

33:47.400 --> 33:49.290
Your fingerprints were found
in Alex Forrest's apartment.

33:49.490 --> 33:52.080
Oh, it's a person.
Okay, who's that?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.170
Wait, what do you--

33:54.370 --> 33:55.650
what do you mean
my fingerprints?

33:55.850 --> 33:56.990
Why do you have my fingerprints?

33:58.550 --> 33:59.740
They said when the case
got thrown out,

33:59.940 --> 34:02.260
my prints would be erased
from the system.

34:02.460 --> 34:04.090
I don't know who "they" are,
but that doesn't just

34:04.290 --> 34:05.090
happen automatically.

34:05.290 --> 34:06.440
You have to file a petition

34:06.640 --> 34:07.310
to have your print card
destroyed.

34:07.510 --> 34:08.790
Are you shitting me?

34:08.990 --> 34:10.920
- No.
- The cops decided
I was their guy

34:11.120 --> 34:13.190
just based on me existing
and them being lazy fucks.

34:13.390 --> 34:14.710
Okay, and so having no case,
not even being able

34:14.910 --> 34:16.710
to get me indicted,
but here you guys are

34:16.910 --> 34:17.930
asking me do I know someone?

34:18.130 --> 34:19.370
And my fingerprints,

34:19.570 --> 34:21.060
you think that's fucking right,
dude?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.720
I-- that doesn't really have
anything to do with us.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.420
Oh, it's got something
to do with you.

34:25.610 --> 34:27.160
All we know is that your prints
were in her apartment,

34:27.360 --> 34:29.160
whether you remember her or not.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.460
Okay, it's a her?

34:30.660 --> 34:31.640
When the fuck are we
talking about?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.340
2008.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.210
[laughs]

34:35.410 --> 34:37.210
Fucking unbelievable.
Uh, where'd she live?

34:37.410 --> 34:38.990
- She live downtown?
- She did.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.690
Yeah, did she eat food,
you think?

34:41.890 --> 34:45.440
Okay, so maybe she ordered food
that I delivered.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.830
Like a chump on a beach cruiser
with a basket on the front,

34:48.030 --> 34:48.960
'cause my dad said he
didn't want to waste money

34:49.160 --> 34:50.010
on a bike with actual gears

34:50.200 --> 34:51.050
when we already had this one

34:51.250 --> 34:52.180
my fucking grandma wasn't using.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.700
Yeah, I never want to forget

34:53.900 --> 34:56.490
those good times.
Thanks, guys.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.100
What, you said I had to
file a petition?

34:58.300 --> 35:01.410
A petition, yeah,
of factual innocence.

35:01.610 --> 35:03.630
If it's granted, then they
destroy your arrest record

35:03.830 --> 35:04.890
and your print card.

35:05.090 --> 35:07.240
Great.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.190
Hmm.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.640
So these two names are
the flower strain

35:12.840 --> 35:15.070
- and the hash strain?
- Exactly.

35:15.270 --> 35:17.340
So in these, the flower
would be Lotus Diesel,

35:17.540 --> 35:19.560
and the hash strain is
Wet-Ass persimmon.

35:19.760 --> 35:20.770
Do I want that?

35:20.970 --> 35:22.990
What's a tincture?

35:23.190 --> 35:25.820
Ooh.

35:26.020 --> 35:27.690
What's this?

35:27.890 --> 35:30.260
It's pizza. What do you mean,
"What's this?"

35:30.460 --> 35:31.740
Is there ketchup?

35:31.940 --> 35:35.530
No, because life's an asshole.

35:35.730 --> 35:38.580
Oh, uh...

35:38.770 --> 35:40.830
Oh, hi.

35:42.790 --> 35:45.180
Plenty of alternate goos
in here.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.280
Okay, ketchup-adjacent goos.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.630
Well,

35:51.830 --> 35:55.200
one of these has to work.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.540
[sighs]

36:00.020 --> 36:01.600
He was great today.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.170
- Who, the Weed Baron?
- Yeah.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.860
In what sense?

36:05.060 --> 36:06.650
Well, in the for-purpose sense.

36:06.850 --> 36:10.090
He's emotional, quick to anger,

36:10.280 --> 36:11.870
a suspect in another
violent death.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.300
I like him.

36:15.780 --> 36:17.530
'Cause you can see it in him.

36:17.730 --> 36:21.920
The potential.
What he did to his dad.

36:22.120 --> 36:26.140
How angry he still is
this many years later.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.710
That's what I'm in this for.

36:27.910 --> 36:29.370
- [door closes]
- You know?

36:29.560 --> 36:32.540
Cause a new trial,
judge says you didn't do it.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.020
That still leaves
the person who did.

36:35.220 --> 36:39.110
The person I kind of burned
my life down believing in.

36:39.310 --> 36:43.630
And until I find him,
I'm not done.

36:45.980 --> 36:47.510
I can't even think about

36:47.710 --> 36:50.600
somebody else getting caught,
convicted...

36:50.800 --> 36:53.520
It feels so far away.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.040
Denormalizing. Denorm--

36:56.240 --> 36:58.700
- Demormalizing.
- [both laugh]

36:58.900 --> 37:00.790
Demormonizing.

37:00.990 --> 37:03.830
[laughing]:
Can't say demoralizing.

37:04.030 --> 37:06.920
Well, don't worry about it,

37:07.120 --> 37:12.060
but just know that for me...
[sighs]

37:12.260 --> 37:13.880
it is the endgame.

37:17.750 --> 37:21.900
Wait, what'd you do with
Mom's... pinochle snacks?

37:22.100 --> 37:26.200
[gasps]
Pinochle snacks...

37:27.980 --> 37:29.510
So he actually stopped
seeing her at all,

37:29.710 --> 37:31.120
even as an analyst,
because he didn't want to hurt

37:31.320 --> 37:32.650
his wife and daughters,

37:32.850 --> 37:35.170
until he realized that
his attraction to her

37:35.370 --> 37:36.740
was coming from his unconscious.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.130
And if he didn't act on it,

37:39.330 --> 37:42.870
if he didn't explore
his erotic potential,

37:43.070 --> 37:45.750
he would actually be
damaging his daughters

37:45.950 --> 37:47.400
by making them witness
to his unlived life,

37:47.600 --> 37:49.310
and therefore ruining
their Eros.

37:49.510 --> 37:53.490
Okay, so his daughters
needed him to fuck around

37:53.690 --> 37:57.450
on their mom with this
Toni Wolff woman,

37:57.650 --> 37:59.800
or they would never feel whole.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.240
He did it for them.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.630
- Or...
- I got it.

38:02.830 --> 38:04.550
Or, if he didn't,

38:04.750 --> 38:07.120
then they would grow up
watching him fight

38:07.310 --> 38:08.680
the drive of his spirit
to connect.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.290
And then they would learn
to fight that drive, too,

38:10.490 --> 38:12.380
and then they would never
truly be happy

38:12.580 --> 38:14.690
or live completely in the world.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.430
I mean, I don't think that,

38:16.630 --> 38:18.950
but I think that
that's what he meant.

38:19.150 --> 38:21.900
Do you think your father
killed Alex Forrest?

38:23.910 --> 38:25.260
- What?
- I'm-I'm sorry.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.270
I'm not trying
to make things weird,

38:27.470 --> 38:29.570
I just fell down a fucking
Google hole the other night.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.880
No, he didn't.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.390
You sound really sure.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.970
You probably know what
his alibi was then, I guess.

38:38.170 --> 38:41.580
Just the... the threads online

38:41.780 --> 38:44.060
and the excerpts of
the trial transcripts said

38:44.260 --> 38:45.150
that he didn't have any.

38:45.350 --> 38:46.890
He did. He was at home with us.

38:47.090 --> 38:50.680
All right, just seems like
if you're being

38:50.880 --> 38:54.370
tried for murder,
you'd want to bring that up.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.250
I gotta pee.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.910
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>What are they gonna find</i>
<i>on your phone, Dan?</i>

39:08.110 --> 39:09.610
Nothing. Nothing.

39:09.810 --> 39:11.610
I wiped it the second he walked
out of the office.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.400
I didn't think it was gonna be
Marcella who was coming for it,

39:13.600 --> 39:14.920
but I knew somebody would.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.450
Okay, just don't talk to anybody
about anything.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.140
That's the rule.

39:18.340 --> 39:19.710
But if you got to talk
to somebody about something,

39:19.910 --> 39:21.840
- why the fuck would it be Earl?
- I know, I know.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.630
And you didn't just talk to him,
you lied to him.

39:23.830 --> 39:26.280
He smells blood in
the water now, goddamn it.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.760
What does he think he has on me?

39:27.960 --> 39:28.940
I don't know. I went down
to Robbery-Homicide,

39:29.140 --> 39:30.240
and I talked to Hailey.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.900
Aw, Christ, Captain Headline
himself.

39:32.090 --> 39:34.330
And according to him,
what Earl's got is

39:34.530 --> 39:36.160
everybody's blessing
down there to go at you

39:36.360 --> 39:39.030
as hard as he fucking can.

39:39.230 --> 39:40.860
Even if they had enough
to arrest me,

39:41.060 --> 39:43.040
there's no way that Marcella's
authorizing a charge, right?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.560
It's an election year coming.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.650
Her slogan is
"equal justice under the law."

39:46.850 --> 39:49.300
It's hard to beat taking down
your own Chief of Major Crimes

39:49.500 --> 39:51.310
to prove you're serious
about that.

39:51.510 --> 39:54.000
- This is a joke.
- [sighs]

39:54.200 --> 39:56.220
Right? This is a joke.
Alex is playing a joke on me

39:56.420 --> 39:59.270
because she knows exactly
how to fuck with me.

39:59.470 --> 40:01.140
I don't believe
she's actually dead.

40:01.340 --> 40:02.930
- I can't.
- I know.

40:03.130 --> 40:05.100
Why don't you say it
ten more times?

40:05.300 --> 40:07.710
Maybe I'll go for it then.

40:07.910 --> 40:09.630
Fuck.

40:09.830 --> 40:11.940
He betrayed you
and humiliated you,

40:12.130 --> 40:15.810
and now-now... now he makes you
his goddamn bagman.

40:16.010 --> 40:18.680
Okay, enough with the moral
outrage, Dad, okay?

40:18.880 --> 40:21.680
These kinds of things can
cost upwards of $500,000,

40:21.880 --> 40:23.430
- retainer and fees.
- [muttering]

40:23.620 --> 40:25.300
And things are gonna start
to move quickly.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.860
We don't have time.

40:27.060 --> 40:28.260
Did you kill that woman?

40:28.460 --> 40:31.430
Oh, my God,
of course he didn't. Dad!

40:31.630 --> 40:33.480
Even if I had that kind
of liquidity,

40:33.680 --> 40:35.390
even if I could, I wouldn't.

40:35.590 --> 40:37.220
BETH: Do you think if I had any
other choice, I'd be asking...

40:37.420 --> 40:39.310
WARREN:
That money was for you
and Ellen. Not for...

40:39.510 --> 40:41.230
BETH:
...begging you-- What-what
do you think Mom would want?

40:41.420 --> 40:43.180
- If it was for me and Ellen...
- WARREN: Mom? Mom would want me

40:43.380 --> 40:45.100
- to protect you...
- BETH: ...then give it to me,
I need it.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.930
- We need it.
- WARREN: Because someone should!

40:48.130 --> 40:50.500
It's just too much for him
to react to

40:50.700 --> 40:52.150
on top of everything.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.540
He just, he needs to sit
with it.

40:54.740 --> 40:57.330
He'll come around.
He loves you.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.370
More than he hates Dan?

40:59.570 --> 41:00.900
More than anything.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.770
But you probably don't have
the time to wait.

41:03.970 --> 41:06.080
And if you push him right now,

41:06.280 --> 41:08.600
- he's just gonna dig in.
- Nope.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.910
- But that's okay.
- Yeah.

41:12.110 --> 41:13.740
Because we're gonna do it.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.350
- What?
- You're gonna do what?

41:16.550 --> 41:17.700
Pay for it.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.790
The lawyer, the retainer,
whatever else.

41:20.990 --> 41:22.610
Alan's gonna call you.
Our accountant.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.700
- What are you talking about?
- JULIA: We don't have kids.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.710
- ARTHUR: It's done.
- You can't take it with you.

41:27.910 --> 41:29.870
This is happening.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.500
He's sad he won't be able
to afford

41:33.690 --> 41:36.150
the solid gold house
and rocket car

41:36.350 --> 41:39.200
he was planning to get
after I'm gone,

41:39.400 --> 41:41.850
- but he'll get over it.
- Yeah.

41:42.050 --> 41:44.510
And everyone will have
a rocket car eventually.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.410
- [Julia chuckles]
- I just gotta be patient.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.250
Listen, I don't want you
to do this.

41:49.450 --> 41:52.820
We're gonna, though,
with pleasure.

41:53.020 --> 41:57.340
I mean, not with pleasure,
but... you know what I mean.

41:59.470 --> 42:02.650
I've just been so worried

42:02.850 --> 42:05.090
that you aren't gonna know

42:05.290 --> 42:07.300
how much I loved you.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.530
[indistinct chatter]

42:21.320 --> 42:23.020
Deputy District Attorney.

42:23.220 --> 42:25.720
Not too much trouble
finding us, I hope.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.510
You better tell me
you got a lawyer coming,

42:27.710 --> 42:28.990
'cause I'm not getting
this tossed over some

42:29.180 --> 42:30.120
"you technically
weren't represented

42:30.320 --> 42:31.730
at the time" bullshit.

42:31.930 --> 42:34.160
I'm Beth Gallagher.
I'm his wife.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.430
Pleasure, Mrs. Gallagher.

42:36.630 --> 42:37.780
Wish the circumstances
were different.

42:37.980 --> 42:40.870
Okay, let's go, Detective.

42:41.070 --> 42:44.740
Or were you offering
drink service first?

42:44.940 --> 42:46.960
That's cute.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.610
- No, we're actually ready.
- Excuse me.

42:49.810 --> 42:51.050
I want a Polaroid of all
the fillers in place

42:51.250 --> 42:52.970
before I decide my client's
position.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.490
I want rap sheets on
all the fillers who have them,

42:55.690 --> 42:57.320
and personnel records
of all the fillers

42:57.520 --> 42:59.010
who are off-duty cops.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.970
Do you have those things
to which I'm entitled

43:02.170 --> 43:04.670
prepared to give me?

43:04.870 --> 43:07.890
Then you're not actually ready.

43:08.090 --> 43:09.460
Wow, you really must be
shitting yourself

43:09.660 --> 43:12.770
to hire this mutt, huh?

43:12.970 --> 43:15.590
Don't ever directly address
the mutt's client again, please.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.640
I'm gonna go give him
some acid reflux.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.540
Clay Bishop, it turns out,
not Cliff Biffsmiths.

43:45.740 --> 43:46.890
Ruth wouldn't tell me
he existed,

43:47.090 --> 43:49.850
but she told him I was asking.

43:50.050 --> 43:52.330
Do you still work
in Legal Aid, or...?

43:52.530 --> 43:55.160
At the foundation now, but yeah.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.250
Huh. So we must have
crossed paths back in the day.

43:57.450 --> 43:59.510
We did.

43:59.710 --> 44:03.430
So, uh, we've heard from
a reliable source

44:03.630 --> 44:07.650
that you were in a relationship
with Alex Forrest

44:07.850 --> 44:10.430
at some point in the year
before her death.

44:10.630 --> 44:13.480
For a few months, yeah.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.210
What happened?

44:17.170 --> 44:18.920
I fucked it up.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.610
In what sense?

44:22.220 --> 44:23.710
There are...

44:23.910 --> 44:27.930
<i>were</i>mental health issues
in my family.

44:28.130 --> 44:32.670
Being around Alex,
I could see so many things

44:32.870 --> 44:35.240
in her that were familiar
from growing up.

44:35.440 --> 44:39.030
But you've got to be careful
when you try to

44:39.230 --> 44:41.120
go there with someone
who thinks no one knows

44:41.320 --> 44:43.820
they're not okay, and I wasn't.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.170
I went about it the wrong way.

44:46.370 --> 44:49.690
I never got another chance.

44:49.890 --> 44:52.740
Did you ever think about
coming forward?

44:52.940 --> 44:55.650
That was my defense--
her mental state.

44:55.850 --> 44:57.440
No, yeah, I know.
I was there.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.480
I went to court every day.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.310
I heard all about how you were
so appropriately polite to Alex

45:02.510 --> 45:03.920
that she lost her mind.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.060
Heard you describe
someone unstable

45:06.250 --> 45:09.060
and scared and lost as evil.

45:09.260 --> 45:13.980
Mr. I'm The Victim's Voice.
"I speak for the victims."

45:14.180 --> 45:16.110
Prosecutor's toolbox, right?

45:16.310 --> 45:19.420
Evil's elemental. It means
no one has to feel guilty.

45:19.620 --> 45:23.800
Not even you, after you
gave her death for needing help.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.110
But they still hated you more.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.730
At least there was that.

45:34.810 --> 45:37.860
Finally a jury saw the real you.

45:44.780 --> 45:46.130
[Mike scoffs]

45:47.610 --> 45:49.230
Okay, okay.

45:49.430 --> 45:51.490
He made some cutting remarks
that maybe now

45:51.690 --> 45:53.890
you're internalizing.

45:54.090 --> 45:55.970
But it doesn't mean
he didn't kill her.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.630
Hey, let's go to Andolini's
later, okay?

46:01.830 --> 46:04.590
- No, I...
- Judge Mills' retirement racket.

46:04.790 --> 46:06.990
Drink your feelings,
like an Irishman should.

46:07.190 --> 46:09.240
Come on.

46:11.980 --> 46:14.300
All right, I'll take you
back to work.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.430
You drive my car there,
you can drive it home.

46:16.630 --> 46:17.910
I'll take an Uber.

46:18.110 --> 46:20.300
Since I'm gonna engulf
so much free vodka

46:20.500 --> 46:21.960
at this fuckin' thing
they're gonna make me

46:22.160 --> 46:25.340
the president of Poland.
Come on.

46:27.870 --> 46:29.870
[busy chatter]

46:34.570 --> 46:36.060
No one said you were coming.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.020
Oh, fuck, I live to disappoint.

46:38.220 --> 46:39.670
[laughter]

46:39.870 --> 46:41.670
- Hey, Mikey.
- Oh, shit.

46:41.870 --> 46:43.500
Urbanek, you rockin'
a beard now?

46:43.700 --> 46:46.630
What a horrible day
to have eyes.

46:46.830 --> 46:48.940
Shit, Mikey, I don't
see you for years,

46:49.140 --> 46:51.510
now I can't get rid of you.

46:51.710 --> 46:55.080
- Following you like a bad smell.
- Mm-hmm.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.170
Hey, you see Gonzales is here?

46:57.370 --> 46:58.860
- Oh, no shit?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

46:59.060 --> 47:00.210
- "Vigil" Gonzales?
- Yeah.

47:00.410 --> 47:01.910
- That's what it was.
- No sh-- Yeah.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.480
Now, why did we call him
that again?

47:03.680 --> 47:05.440
- Was it the serial case
in Newton?
- Yeah.

47:05.630 --> 47:07.220
'Cause Gonzales goes, "Hey, we
can't call it 'Operation Vigil'

47:07.420 --> 47:08.610
"because 'Vigil' and 'Villain'
both start

47:08.810 --> 47:10.530
- with a V."
- [laughs]

47:10.730 --> 47:12.050
And fucking Evrard goes,

47:12.250 --> 47:13.660
"Hey, yeah,
but your first name is 'Hector,'

47:13.860 --> 47:15.710
"and Hector starts
with an H, and so does

47:15.910 --> 47:17.800
'Ho, my God, would you
shut the fuck up?'"

47:18.000 --> 47:20.490
- That's right, that's right,
that's right.
- Fuckin'...

47:20.690 --> 47:23.060
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

47:23.260 --> 47:26.370
- Hey, you remember a case
a while back?
- Hmm.

47:26.570 --> 47:29.590
Guy got murdered,
had a sandwich place downtown,

47:29.790 --> 47:31.810
case never make it out
of grand jury?

47:32.010 --> 47:33.420
Yeah.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.470
Ackroyd... No. Acosta.

47:35.660 --> 47:38.210
Yeah.

47:38.410 --> 47:40.950
Son pureed him
with a 60-inch pipe wrench

47:41.150 --> 47:43.160
and then walked off
into the sunset.

47:46.340 --> 47:48.260
Tell you what.
He better hope that the guys

47:48.460 --> 47:51.000
that worked that case don't get
some kind of terminal disease

47:51.200 --> 47:52.790
'cause he's gonna be their
last stop before they kick it.

47:52.990 --> 47:54.880
- [scoffs]
- That psycho shitstain.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.970
Unbelievable.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.970
- That is unbelievable.
- Mm.

47:59.170 --> 48:01.800
Also, psycho
shitstain's prints being

48:02.000 --> 48:03.700
in Alex Forrest's apartment
is unbelievable.

48:06.180 --> 48:08.270
Except for how they were.

48:11.450 --> 48:13.020
<i>BETH:</i>
<i>I mean,</i>

48:13.220 --> 48:14.500
<i>I'm sorry your friend has</i>
<i>the Internet,</i>

48:14.700 --> 48:16.030
<i>and-and that she blindsided you.</i>

48:16.230 --> 48:18.030
<i>Drunk people do</i>
<i>kind of like to do that.</i>

48:18.230 --> 48:20.630
I mean, she's right, though,
about the alibi.

48:21.850 --> 48:23.910
About his not having one
being weird.

48:24.100 --> 48:25.860
<i>He did have one.</i>

48:26.060 --> 48:27.600
Right,
but nobody testifying to it

48:27.800 --> 48:29.480
- was like saying that he didn't.
<i>- Right.</i>

48:29.680 --> 48:31.390
<i>And the person testifying</i>
<i>to it would have been me,</i>

48:31.590 --> 48:32.960
<i>and that would have opened me up</i>

48:33.160 --> 48:34.520
<i>to being asked</i>
<i>if he'd had an affair.</i>

48:34.720 --> 48:36.310
<i>Your father gave up his alibi</i>

48:36.510 --> 48:38.090
<i>so I wouldn't be charged</i>
<i>with perjury.</i>

48:38.290 --> 48:39.750
I know.

48:39.950 --> 48:41.790
<i>I know you know.</i>
<i>Did you tell her?</i>

48:41.990 --> 48:44.140
<i>Or are you saying</i>
<i>you agree with her a little?</i>

48:44.340 --> 48:45.620
[scoffs]

48:45.820 --> 48:47.410
How would I agree
with her a little?

48:47.610 --> 48:49.970
Think Dad killed Alex Forrest,
but just part of her?

48:50.170 --> 48:51.890
Just killed her partially?

48:52.090 --> 48:54.200
<i>Well, it's pretty shitty</i>
<i>that she did that, I think.</i>

48:54.400 --> 48:57.500
<i>That she said those things,</i>
<i>tried to pick a fight with you.</i>

48:57.700 --> 48:59.420
<i>Maybe a good question</i>
<i>to ask would be</i>

48:59.620 --> 49:01.760
<i>what's up with your friend?</i>

49:06.110 --> 49:08.040
I don't think so,
but I have played hearts.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.820
I was pretty good at hearts.

49:10.020 --> 49:13.870
Well, pinochle and hearts
are both trick-taking games.

49:14.070 --> 49:16.700
Well, maybe
I'll sit in next time.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.340
You're not invited.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.650
How's your thing going? Good?

49:23.690 --> 49:25.360
Yeah. We're making progress.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.230
Ah, that's nice.

49:27.430 --> 49:31.020
I won't ask
why you're bothering.

49:31.220 --> 49:33.980
What's that old saw--
Socrates, or someone?

49:34.170 --> 49:36.670
"The clouds change,
but people don't"?

49:36.870 --> 49:39.020
[laughs]

49:39.220 --> 49:41.500
I've always found that
to be true.

49:41.700 --> 49:44.420
Uh, about their minds, at least.

49:44.620 --> 49:47.370
People don't change their minds.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.430
Maybe that's Joni Mitchell.
[chuckles]

49:52.630 --> 49:56.210
Hey, next time,
don't forget the sesame sticks.

49:56.410 --> 50:00.220
Fannie Sykes gave me
a big ration of shit.

50:00.420 --> 50:03.350
I-I didn't.
I-I didn't forget them.

50:03.550 --> 50:05.650
- I bought them.
- Then where were they?

50:17.400 --> 50:19.630
- [grunts]
- How you like me
at your fucking house,

50:19.830 --> 50:21.330
- motherfucker?! Huh?
- [grunting]

50:21.530 --> 50:22.810
- You like it?
- [groans]

50:23.010 --> 50:24.160
I come to your house now.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.590
Maybe I'm gonna talk
to your wife now,

50:26.790 --> 50:28.160
dogshit motherfucker.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.600
MIKE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop

50:29.800 --> 50:31.250
whatever the fuck
you're doing right now.

50:31.450 --> 50:33.510
Stop it. Go faster than that,
you asshole.

50:33.710 --> 50:35.080
Get down on the ground.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.910
Get down on the fucking ground
away from him

50:38.110 --> 50:41.220
before I get mad. Or madder.

50:41.420 --> 50:42.910
Jesus Christ.

50:43.110 --> 50:44.650
Dan, go through his pockets.

50:44.850 --> 50:46.830
See if he's got any ID
or something, okay? You okay?

50:47.030 --> 50:48.920
- Oh, yeah, great.
- Good.

50:49.120 --> 50:51.570
- Never better. [groans]
- Whew. In retrospect,

50:51.770 --> 50:55.060
I got to say, that fifth round--
that was a bad idea.

50:55.260 --> 50:58.880
- [sighs]
- Hey, asshole, kiss the dirt.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.410
"Artem Fedorko."

51:01.610 --> 51:04.280
Fe-- Well, that's a silly name.
Artem? The...

51:04.480 --> 51:06.680
Wait. Artem, as in,

51:06.880 --> 51:09.720
Olena Kuzma has a piece of shit
boyfriend named Artem?

51:09.920 --> 51:11.510
You were talking
about Olena's house.

51:11.710 --> 51:14.290
I was just in there.

51:14.490 --> 51:16.770
- Oh, she married this asshole.
- [door opens]

51:16.970 --> 51:19.470
- How depressing is that?
- Mikey?

51:19.670 --> 51:21.950
- Hey, Ma.
- You want me to call 911?

51:22.150 --> 51:23.480
No, don't call 911.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.000
- It's okay.
- [groans]

51:25.200 --> 51:28.050
Ma, on second thought, call 911.

51:28.250 --> 51:31.220
