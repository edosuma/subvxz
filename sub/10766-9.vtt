00:04.449 --> 00:08.112
Will, I can't believe I took your advice
about my TV campaign spot.

00:08.186 --> 00:10.450
Uncle Phil, you really would have
buried Judge Robertson...

00:10.522 --> 00:13.047
if you would have let me put
the Uh-Huh Girls in there with you.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.390
It would have been like,
"Banks is the right one, baby, uh-huh!"

00:18.130 --> 00:20.496
- Here it comes.
- Come, sit down.

00:22.534 --> 00:25.560
Oh, and by the way, Uncle Phil...

00:25.771 --> 00:29.537
I don't remember if I told you or not, but
when I dropped the tape off at the editor...

00:29.608 --> 00:32.509
I just, you know,
authorized a few last minute changes.

00:32.578 --> 00:36.446
Y ou authorized a few... Nobody gave
you permission to authorize any changes.

00:36.515 --> 00:40.315
No, but it's cool, Uncle Phil,
you're going to love it. Here it comes.

00:40.419 --> 00:44.549
<i>Hi, /'m Phi/ip Banks,</i>
<i>and /'m running for Superior Court Judge.</i>

00:53.765 --> 00:55.392
What the hell is that?

00:56.435 --> 00:58.528
That was our New y ear's <i>E</i> ve party.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.330
Uncle Phil, you know,
I just put in a couple of home movies...

01:01.406 --> 01:02.930
you know, to show your human side.

01:03.008 --> 01:04.908
It gets better, check it out.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.605
<i>And if you put me on the bench,</i>
<i>/'// take a rea/ bite out of crime.</i>

01:08.680 --> 01:10.272

<i>Phi/ip Banks.</i>

01:28.133 --> 01:29.430
<i>E</i> mmy!

01:31.236 --> 01:33.534
Hey, so what do you think, Uncle Phil?

02:47.713 --> 02:48.907
Dad...

02:49.881 --> 02:52.679
Will would like to know
if he can please come in.

03:02.394 --> 03:05.295
Come on, Daddy,
at least let him sleep in the house.

03:05.764 --> 03:09.700
Come on, Philip, he was only trying
to help. Come on, baby, come on in.

03:18.844 --> 03:23.076
Look, Uncle Phil, I know we didn't exactly
see eye to eye on the commercial...

03:23.215 --> 03:26.582
- but I got a lot of positive feedback.
- Oh, please, from who?

03:26.718 --> 03:30.085
From Latisha.
She said you looked really handsome.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.389
But she also thought Delta Burke
looked better as a blonde.

03:37.429 --> 03:39.795
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, guys.

03:41.032 --> 03:44.024
Baby, you are positively glowing today.

03:44.402 --> 03:45.460
Thank you.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.572
New moisturizer.

03:48.874 --> 03:51.604
We can't all be
as blessed as you are, Mom.

03:52.511 --> 03:55.844
Trevor, that's so sweet.
But, honey, call me Mrs. Banks.

04:00.619 --> 04:02.917
Home of the Whopper, what's your beef?

04:06.258 --> 04:08.021
Y eah, right. Okay.

04:08.226 --> 04:09.659
Will, who is it?

04:09.861 --> 04:12.557
Some chicken here talking about
she from the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show.</i>

04:12.631 --> 04:15.099
That would be for me, homey.

04:17.202 --> 04:18.396
Alexis.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.728
Y es, so did you speak to Oprah yet?

04:21.206 --> 04:23.003
What, you mean this call's legit?

04:23.074 --> 04:25.872
Will, Trevor knows
lots of very important people.

04:25.944 --> 04:28.105
So, what about <i>Oprah?</i> Is it a deal?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.511
Super.

04:29.748 --> 04:31.477
I owe you big time, babe.

04:31.550 --> 04:34.610
This is Trevor Collins,
goodbye and Godspeed.

04:38.156 --> 04:40.556
What's all this excitement?
What's going on?

04:40.625 --> 04:42.024
I don't know. What's all this excitement?

04:42.093 --> 04:45.187
- We're all going to be on <i>Oprah.</i>
- We're all gonna be on <i>Oprah.</i>

04:45.964 --> 04:48.797
And it's all thanks to Trevor.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.334
Well...

04:53.338 --> 04:56.967
Wait a minute. Trevor,
why should Oprah care anything about us?

04:57.042 --> 04:59.670
Well, actually, Phil, she doesn't,
you're nobody.

04:59.744 --> 05:03.680
But Alexis, the woman who books
the show, is an old friend of Trevor's.

05:03.882 --> 05:06.180
I kind of got the feeling
she had a crush on you.

05:06.251 --> 05:08.344
Well...

05:08.420 --> 05:11.912
Actually, she had
the cutest little nickname for me.

05:12.157 --> 05:13.886
- What was it?
- God.

05:19.064 --> 05:22.261
Anyway, Alexis said
I couldn't have called at a better time.

05:22.334 --> 05:25.269
They're doing a show about
political candidates and their families...

05:25.337 --> 05:28.363
and she said that one of the families
just dropped out.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.534
So they're flying all of us
to Chicago tomorrow morning.

05:31.610 --> 05:35.046
I'm so excited.
I have always wanted to go to Chicago.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.375
Wait, am I going to need a passport?

05:40.151 --> 05:43.746
All right, I got things to do.
I got to get a new fade.

05:43.922 --> 05:46.914
I got to get some new shoestrings
for my Doc Martens. Oh, man.

05:46.992 --> 05:48.823
I'm going to be on <i>Oprah!</i>

05:50.195 --> 05:53.187
Phil, I hate to bust the boy's balloon...

05:53.398 --> 05:56.561
but Alexis said she could
only book the immediate family.

05:57.369 --> 05:58.996
Y ou mean Will can't go?

05:59.571 --> 06:01.368
That's darned unfair.

06:01.706 --> 06:04.800
And I think I speak for everyone
in this room when I say:

06:04.876 --> 06:06.605
"What am I going to wear?"

06:10.782 --> 06:12.147
Philip...

06:12.517 --> 06:15.350
honey, how can we disappoint Will?
He's a part of this family.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.980
No, Vivian, he's a part of your family.

06:18.189 --> 06:21.056
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but he's damaged my campaign enough.

06:21.126 --> 06:23.094
And the sooner we tell him
he's not coming with us...

06:23.161 --> 06:24.389
the easier it will be on him.

06:24.462 --> 06:27.158
Hey, Mom, guess what,
I'm going to be on <i>Oprah.</i>

06:29.000 --> 06:31.264
And as soon as you tell him, let me know.

06:38.576 --> 06:39.634
Morning.

06:39.711 --> 06:42.703
Philip, honey, how come you're not
dressed? We're leaving in an hour.

06:42.781 --> 06:45.147
Oh, sweetheart, relax.
We have plenty of time.

06:45.216 --> 06:48.743
So how did Will take it when you
finally broke the news to him?

06:49.154 --> 06:51.179
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell him.

06:51.256 --> 06:53.747
Fine, I'll tell him.

06:54.059 --> 06:56.220
How difficult could it possibly be?

07:02.701 --> 07:05.363
So, what do you think?

07:06.137 --> 07:07.502
Have we met?

07:08.974 --> 07:13.206
Come on, Uncle Phil, I just wanted to
fit in with you all when we go on <i>Oprah.</i>

07:14.479 --> 07:16.709
Hey, look, Uncle Phil...

07:17.916 --> 07:21.374
I got to tell you, man,
taking me to Chicago with you...

07:22.187 --> 07:23.984
that really means a lot to me.

07:24.055 --> 07:25.113
Y eah, you know, Will, there...

07:25.190 --> 07:26.919
And it ain't just because
I promised Latisha...

07:26.992 --> 07:29.460
I was going to scream her name out on TV.

07:30.095 --> 07:34.054
It's because, you know, you really
make me feel like part of your family.

07:46.711 --> 07:49.805
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
I guess I'll just go out in the car...

07:49.881 --> 07:52.008
and wait quietly in the back seat.

07:57.655 --> 08:01.022
- Well, that's telling him, Philip.
- All right, look...

08:01.092 --> 08:03.117
he can go to Chicago with us
and watch the show...

08:03.194 --> 08:05.560
- but we have to tell him on the plane.
- Okay.

08:06.598 --> 08:10.534
- <i>E</i> xcuse me, sir, are you Will Smith?
- Y es, stewardess.

08:10.769 --> 08:13.033
Y our family asked me to speak to you.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.402
Wow, I'm sorry for staring, but...

08:18.710 --> 08:20.541
man, girl, you real fine.

08:20.912 --> 08:24.040
Y ou know, I was a little nervous
about flying, but...

08:24.115 --> 08:27.175
as long as I can look at you,
I know I'll be all right.

08:27.652 --> 08:30.143
I'm sorry,
what was you going to say to me?

08:30.488 --> 08:32.456
Can I fluff your pillow?

08:40.465 --> 08:42.524
Wow. Look at this.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.594
Vivian, this is absurd.

08:45.670 --> 08:49.663
We're going to be on the air in 10 minutes.
We have got to tell Will now.

08:52.177 --> 08:53.974
Oprah Winfrey's studio.

08:54.045 --> 08:56.536
Hey, come on you all, let's get a picture.

08:58.850 --> 09:01.375
Uncle Phil, I'll get you in one later.

09:03.421 --> 09:05.184
Look, Oprah's chair.

09:08.293 --> 09:10.523
I'm gonna send this to my mom.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.955
Honey, couldn't we just put him to sleep?

09:15.967 --> 09:19.698
Y ou must be the Banks family.
Hi, I'm Alexis.

09:19.771 --> 09:23.002
Hi. I'm glad you could make it
on such short notice.

09:23.074 --> 09:25.542
- Well, thank you for having us.
- Sure.

09:25.610 --> 09:28.909
Listen, just make yourselves at home
and I'll be right back.

09:31.549 --> 09:34.712
- Y ou have beautiful hair.
- I know.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.492
So, that's Trevor's old girlfriend, huh?

09:44.562 --> 09:47.087
Y eah, wonder what he ever saw in her.

09:49.334 --> 09:52.633
Okay, everybody remember,
Dad's got an image to uphold here.

09:52.704 --> 09:55.172
So let's conduct ourselves with dignity.

10:01.913 --> 10:04.040
Look, Mommy, Daddy, look!

10:07.218 --> 10:08.310
Y ou...

10:09.220 --> 10:10.710
y ou're Oprah Winfrey.

10:10.788 --> 10:13.689
- I am and that means you must be...
- Ashley.

10:13.758 --> 10:15.248
It's nice to meet you.

10:15.326 --> 10:17.988
- We're the Banks.
- Hey, great, you made it.

10:18.062 --> 10:21.498
- Welcome to Chicago.
- Thank you, this is a real pleasure.

10:21.566 --> 10:25.332
I'm Philip Banks.
This is Hilary, Carlton, Ashley...

10:25.403 --> 10:26.631
and...

10:26.704 --> 10:28.069
- Vivian!
- Y es.

10:28.940 --> 10:31.101
Hi, I'm a very big fan.

10:31.176 --> 10:34.077
Y ou sure are. It's my pleasure.

10:34.579 --> 10:37.070
Oprah, I always love your clothes.

10:37.782 --> 10:40.080
And that's such a gorgeous suit.

10:40.185 --> 10:44.781
Well, I tell you what, if you really
like it, I will send you one in your size.

10:45.456 --> 10:49.085
Wow! I always heard
that you were generous, but...

10:49.494 --> 10:51.724
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.029
Me neither.

10:54.098 --> 10:56.896
Gee, Oprah,
I really like that diamond bracelet.

10:58.670 --> 10:59.762
Nice try.

10:59.837 --> 11:01.998
Hey, I tell you what, I'll see you
guys on the show.

11:02.073 --> 11:04.940
- Okay? See you on TV. Have a good show.
- Thank you.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.423
Hey, that's it.

11:22.627 --> 11:25.960
That's the theme music.
Come on, it's time to go, posse up.

11:28.933 --> 11:30.298
Come on.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.131
Come on, guys, it's time to go.

11:34.205 --> 11:35.399
- Philip.
- All right.

11:35.473 --> 11:37.407
It's time to stop beating around the bush.

11:37.475 --> 11:40.638
Okay, everybody who's going to be on
the <i>Oprah Show,</i> take one step forward.

11:40.712 --> 11:42.111
Not so fast, Will.

11:52.857 --> 11:55.655
Y ou know, all families
have their problems, but...

11:55.727 --> 11:59.356
how would you like to have
your family's dirty laundry...

11:59.430 --> 12:01.364
seen in tomorrow's newspaper?

12:01.432 --> 12:05.391
Well, that's an everyday experience
for most political families.

12:05.536 --> 12:09.028
Please help me welcome my guests today.
Sen. Howard Lloyd...

12:09.107 --> 12:11.701
his wife Pamela and their daughter, Lydia.

12:15.346 --> 12:17.974
And Superior Court hopeful, Philip Banks...

12:18.049 --> 12:22.418
his wife, Vivian, and their children,
Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley.

12:27.225 --> 12:30.194
So, Sen. Lloyd, my first question is to you.

12:30.261 --> 12:33.059
Now you've been a member of
the Senate for quite some time.

12:33.131 --> 12:35.292
Tell me I can't be on <i>Oprah.</i>

12:35.867 --> 12:37.391
Hey, brother, you mind sliding inside...

12:37.468 --> 12:39.868
my legs are kind of long,
I'd like to sit here.

12:40.571 --> 12:42.095
Oh, excuse me.

12:43.107 --> 12:47.203
Philip Banks, you were a successful
attorney with your own private practice...

12:47.278 --> 12:48.506
in Beverly Hills.

12:48.579 --> 12:51.980
And now, you're running for
Superior Court Judge.

12:52.283 --> 12:54.513
We all know that's quite a career change.

12:54.585 --> 12:56.712
What do you hope to get out of it?

12:56.821 --> 13:00.188
I hope to make some changes
in the judicial system and, well...

13:00.258 --> 13:02.283
I've always wanted my own gavel.

13:11.436 --> 13:13.165
Oprah, I have a question.

13:13.438 --> 13:16.669
We're not ready for that portion of
the show just yet, but, Mrs. Banks...

13:16.741 --> 13:20.074
- answer me this if you will.
- I'm Will, Oprah, I can answer it.

13:20.144 --> 13:22.135
- Come here.
- Come? Me come?

13:22.213 --> 13:24.238
Come here. Come on.

13:25.650 --> 13:29.017
Okay, see, this is it.
I'm the one with the microphone.

13:29.354 --> 13:32.585
And you can't answer a question
until I ask the question.

13:32.657 --> 13:33.783
Y ou understand how it works?

13:33.858 --> 13:36.759
Y ou ask then I answer. It works like...

13:36.828 --> 13:38.591
Good. Now sit down.

13:39.397 --> 13:40.659
Sit down.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.900
My God. Vivian, is that Will?

13:45.303 --> 13:48.238
No, Philip, it's Richard Nixon
wearing a Will mask.

13:50.274 --> 13:52.868
No, Mom, I think that really is Will.

13:54.278 --> 13:57.509
So, Lydia, you've spent most of your life
on Capitol Hill.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.115
- Did that have any...
- Oh, Oprah.

14:00.551 --> 14:01.916
Y oung brother...

14:03.221 --> 14:04.415
what do you want?

14:04.489 --> 14:07.583
I was just wondering,
is it the question portion yet?

14:07.825 --> 14:09.884
- Do you have a question?
- Y es.

14:09.961 --> 14:11.792
Okay, what is your question?

14:12.130 --> 14:14.462
I have a question for Sen. Lloyd.

14:15.400 --> 14:19.962
Senator, let's say that, you know, you had
a young urban handsome nephew.

14:20.037 --> 14:23.063
Would you let him come on
the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show</i> with you?

14:23.141 --> 14:27.510
Well, I sure would, son.
And let me say, I love your Leslie Uggams.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.414
Thanks.

14:33.518 --> 14:36.078
- My next question is for Mr. Banks.
- Two questions?

14:36.154 --> 14:37.712
Y eah. Mr. Banks...

14:37.789 --> 14:40.485
would you let your nephew come on
the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show...</i>

14:40.558 --> 14:43.652
or would you make him fly all the way
to Chicago for nothing...

14:43.728 --> 14:47.061
to sit out in the audience,
to be embarrassed in front of his girl.

14:47.131 --> 14:48.564
Hi, Latisha. Huh?

14:56.207 --> 14:59.438
And after I got out of Betty Ford...

15:00.211 --> 15:03.669
I started a new life
with the <i>Maharishi</i> Anaghanda.

15:09.687 --> 15:11.678
Y ou are so brave.

15:11.756 --> 15:14.350
I mean,
wearing red shoes with a pink dress.

15:17.161 --> 15:19.425
I have a question for Mr. Banks.

15:19.497 --> 15:22.364
Has being in politics ruined your sex life?

15:22.433 --> 15:24.697
No, mine's great, how's yours, honey?

15:27.772 --> 15:29.706
Oprah, I have a question.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.472
Will, I missed you. Okay.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.344
My question is for Mrs. Banks.

15:36.113 --> 15:40.049
Mrs. Banks, let's say that
your oldest sister, who sacrificed...

15:40.184 --> 15:43.051
her whole life to raise you,
sent her only son...

15:43.221 --> 15:46.713
out to live with you and you promised to
treat him like your own.

15:46.791 --> 15:50.227
And just for the sake of argument,
let's call him Will.

15:52.930 --> 15:55.694
Would you bring him
on the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show</i> with you...

15:55.766 --> 15:58.758
or would you make him sit in the audience
like you're ashamed of him?

15:58.836 --> 16:01.270
We're not ashamed of you. It's just...

16:02.139 --> 16:04.437
Sit down, shut up, and behave yourself.

16:05.042 --> 16:09.138
Okay, let me take
a wild stab in the dark here.

16:09.547 --> 16:11.105
Y ou all are related?

16:16.420 --> 16:17.580
Y es, Oprah.

16:18.589 --> 16:21.285
See, it's all coming out, it's all coming out.

16:22.994 --> 16:25.485
Anybody got a tissue, anybody?

16:27.431 --> 16:28.989
Thank you. Y es.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.260
Here, you poor sweetheart. Blow.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.537
Y ou poor baby.

16:36.641 --> 16:39.610
I mean, I think this is terrible. This is...

16:39.710 --> 16:42.941
y ou should go up there and be
with your family, where you belong.

16:43.014 --> 16:44.106
Don't you think so, audience?

16:44.181 --> 16:47.344
Go on up there and be with your family,
where you belong.

16:52.957 --> 16:54.788
Move, Ashley, move.

16:57.128 --> 16:58.527
Thank you, Oprah.

16:59.597 --> 17:03.590
Y ou know, Oprah, there's a perfectly
logical explanation for...

17:05.569 --> 17:07.127
y es, yes.

17:07.471 --> 17:11.066
Oprah, this guy
can't even run his own home.

17:11.142 --> 17:13.440
Why should he be elected to office?

17:16.247 --> 17:19.739
<i>E</i> xcuse me, miss, but my husband
would make an excellent judge.

17:19.817 --> 17:22.944
He is a wonderful husband
and a devoted father.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.319
Well, Vivian, I must say that,
yes, you're right.

17:26.390 --> 17:31.191
This looks like it's a very lovely family,
but I've been doing shows a long time.

17:31.395 --> 17:35.661
And one of the things I've learned
is things are not always as they seem.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.666
Oprah, believe me, my dad is a great guy.

17:39.737 --> 17:42.729
I mean, when I lost my job
and he kicked me out of the house...

17:42.807 --> 17:44.775
he let me live out back.

17:48.379 --> 17:50.142
He kicked you out of the house?

17:50.214 --> 17:52.546
Well, he didn't actually
kick her out of the house.

17:52.617 --> 17:56.576
He just changed all the locks
and told her she didn't live there anymore.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.185
Mr. Banks, is that true?

18:01.826 --> 18:04.818
Well, I didn't change all the locks, and...

18:04.895 --> 18:08.194
and she's not living out back,
she's living in the pool house.

18:08.265 --> 18:12.167
Well, with the big pay cut you'll have to
take, we'll all be living in the pool house.

18:12.236 --> 18:16.502
Look, you can forget it. There's hardly
enough room for Trevor and I, as it is.

18:17.541 --> 18:19.907
What is Trevor doing in the pool house?

18:20.044 --> 18:22.945
Y es, Hilary,
what is Trevor doing in the pool house?

18:23.514 --> 18:26.608
Y eah, this is good now, this is good.
I feel like we...

18:26.684 --> 18:28.675
I think we're getting somewhere.

18:28.753 --> 18:29.845
Listen to me.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.718
Hilary, you are not to have men
in the pool house.

18:32.790 --> 18:36.988
Look, I don't like to tell tales out of school,
but Trevor keeps a make-up case there.

18:37.061 --> 18:38.995
- That's a lie.
- Is not.

18:39.063 --> 18:41.531
Stand on a chair and say that to my face.

18:42.466 --> 18:46.835
Y ou have both lost your American <i>E</i> xpress
cards. Do you want to work on your Visa?

18:49.306 --> 18:52.969
These candidates before you say
they want to be elected to public office...

18:53.044 --> 18:54.739
but it seems like...

18:54.979 --> 18:57.948
they can't even keep the peace
in their own families.

18:59.050 --> 19:02.781
Mr. Banks, what do you have to say
on your family's behalf?

19:03.454 --> 19:05.046
Well, Oprah...

19:10.428 --> 19:11.793
What's the point?

19:12.730 --> 19:16.359
- Look, Oprah, I have something to say.
- What a surprise.

19:17.535 --> 19:20.732
Now, look, my uncle brought me out
from Philadelphia to live with him...

19:20.805 --> 19:22.705
so I could get a head start in life.

19:22.773 --> 19:25.298
And, now, we have some problems,
but what family doesn't?

19:25.376 --> 19:29.142
All I know is when I need these people,
they are right there for me.

19:34.719 --> 19:36.744
That's nice of you to say, Will.

19:36.821 --> 19:40.587
Well, if you ask me
your whole damn family is crazy.

19:45.362 --> 19:48.798
All right, see brother, if we was in Philly,
it might have to be something.

19:48.866 --> 19:51.733
But we on TV
and I believe Martin's philosophy...

19:51.802 --> 19:54.100
non-violence, so I'm going to chill.
I'm going to chill.

19:54.171 --> 19:56.901
And if your mama sent you
out here to live with them...

19:56.974 --> 19:58.566
then she's crazy, too.

20:02.046 --> 20:05.072
Hey, man, don't nobody talk about
my mother, man.

20:09.887 --> 20:11.411
We'll be right back.

20:21.265 --> 20:22.630
Hey, Ms. Winfrey.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.467
Will, I'll tell you what...

20:24.535 --> 20:28.027
you know, after all we've been through,
you can call me Oprah.

20:29.340 --> 20:30.807
Y ou got it, Ope...

20:32.243 --> 20:34.074
Oprah.

20:35.713 --> 20:37.578
Y ou know, your initials, O. W?

20:37.648 --> 20:40.116
Did anybody ever tell you
that spells "ow"?

20:41.318 --> 20:42.649
I knew that.

20:43.187 --> 20:44.677
Look, Oprah...

20:46.023 --> 20:48.514
I hope
I didn't mess your show up too much.

20:48.893 --> 20:51.361
And I'm really sorry for the way I acted.

20:51.562 --> 20:55.862
Listen, don't you apologize, because
I'm thinking it was a great experience.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.834
- Really?
- Absolutely.

20:59.136 --> 21:01.161
As a matter of fact, here...

21:02.873 --> 21:04.135
What's this?

21:04.208 --> 21:07.041
Two free tickets to the <i>Donahue Show.</i>

21:08.045 --> 21:10.445
Tell Phil Oprah said, "Hi."

21:13.150 --> 21:14.549
She likes me.

21:17.588 --> 21:19.715
<i>On the nationa/ po/itica/ scene...</i>

21:19.924 --> 21:23.553
Come on, we've heard enough,
turn the TV down. Come on, Will.

21:23.627 --> 21:25.561
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.

21:25.729 --> 21:28.391
Will, you're smiling like Dad does
when he finishes...

21:28.465 --> 21:30.990
the Happy Birthday bucket
at Baskin-Robbins.

21:35.773 --> 21:39.334
Man, you scream your girl's name out
on TV, you'd be smiling, too.

21:40.311 --> 21:43.280
- Look, Dad, the poll results are up next.
- Oh, goody.

21:43.914 --> 21:47.406
Come on, Daddy. I bet being on <i>Oprah</i>
really helped you in the polls.

21:47.484 --> 21:48.781
I'm not worried.

21:48.853 --> 21:51.686
Y ou know,
I was going about this all wrong.

21:51.922 --> 21:55.653
I was trying to come across as the perfect
candidate with the perfect family.

21:55.726 --> 21:58.661
Voters want a candidate
that's human, flawed.

21:58.996 --> 22:00.691
<i>And in /oca/ po/itics...</i>

22:00.798 --> 22:04.290
<i>Phi/ip Banks has p/ummeted</i>
<i>another 8 points in the po//s.</i>

22:06.770 --> 22:10.206
Oh, come on, honey, don't worry.
Y ou're going to win.

22:12.776 --> 22:15.108
Uncle Phil, you're going to win.

22:15.679 --> 22:18.273
And you know why?
'Cause you're a decent man.

22:18.616 --> 22:21.278
I mean, you brought a kid out
from West Philly...

22:21.352 --> 22:23.650
and you made him feel at home
in your house.

22:23.721 --> 22:27.020
I mean, there is no way that
Judge Robertson can compete with that.

22:27.091 --> 22:30.083
<i>And in a re/ated story,</i>
<i>Judge Car/ Robertson...</i>

22:30.160 --> 22:33.994
<i>announced today that he is adopting</i>
<i>12 ghetto youths.</i>

22:39.303 --> 22:40.668
Oh, well.

22:48.312 --> 22:50.576
Y ou have both lost your...

22:53.417 --> 22:55.578

23:03.861 --> 23:06.386
- Oh, God!
- Y ou have just made the blooper reel.
