WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.458
Chaozu had given his life.

00:06.548 --> 00:09.676
Kikoholl

00:12.930 --> 00:14.295
Confound it!

00:14.390 --> 00:17.848
Tenshinhan then followed him.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.175
Nappa!

00:19.269 --> 00:22.477
Three hours remained
until the battle reconvened.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.146
Hurry, Goku!

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your souI already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:53.280 --> 01:59.241
"Will Son Goku Be in Time?!
Three Hours Until the Battle Resumes. "

02:25.854 --> 02:28.470
Why do we have to wait for Kakarrot?

02:28.565 --> 02:32.808
Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans,

02:32.903 --> 02:36.771
and we have to inflict punishment on traitors.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.357
We're going to kill his son and his friends,

02:40.452 --> 02:42.192
right before his eyes.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.239
Afterward, we're going to serve
him up as well, nice and slow.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.575
We're going to show him how powerless he is,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.706
as he writhes in agony.

02:56.593 --> 03:00.211
And in another three or four hours...

03:01.849 --> 03:05.307
...we will be able to give him
a fantastic, hellish show!

03:05.394 --> 03:08.978
| get it! So that's it! That will be great!

03:09.064 --> 03:12.852
That is, if he gets here
in the next three hours.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.936
You can have Kakarrot, but let
me take those other three!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.612
Suit yourself. However...

03:19.700 --> 03:22.316
...do it after you get the
information about the Dragon Balls

03:22.411 --> 03:24.151
out of the Namekian.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.292
I sure hope Kakarrot does come.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.422
Say, at this point, why don't we run away?

03:40.512 --> 03:43.720
There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn.

03:43.807 --> 03:49.268
You fool! Either way, they're
planning to wipe out humanity.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.892
We'll end up the same way
even if we don't flee now.

03:52.983 --> 03:57.397
D-Damn! Please, Goku! Get here!

03:57.487 --> 04:02.607
Show them how much, much
stronger than them you've become!

04:04.202 --> 04:06.739
Hurry! H urry! H urry!

04:06.830 --> 04:07.819
Still not yet?

04:16.339 --> 04:20.253
Piccolo, Goku is sure to get here
in the next three hours, right?

04:20.344 --> 04:22.460
Who knows?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.671
Think about some way to inflict
even a little damage on them

04:25.766 --> 04:28.223
before Son Goku gets here.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.392
P-Piccolo-san!

04:30.479 --> 04:34.097
P-Please train me again
during these three hours!

04:34.191 --> 04:35.306
Don't act like a baby!

04:35.400 --> 04:39.643
I have no need for pantywaists.
Go on and get out of here.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.979
P-Piccolo-san...

04:48.997 --> 04:50.112
Piccolo!

04:50.207 --> 04:55.577
I've driIIed everything into you.
You're more than just this.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.287
Gohan! Come back!

04:58.382 --> 05:00.088
Gohan!

05:04.596 --> 05:06.973
Kid, are you trying to run away?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.764
Not that that isn't the smart thing to do!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.389
Who's running away?!

05:13.480 --> 05:16.142
Your momma's belly button sticks out!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.728
That little brat!

05:19.820 --> 05:25.941
H-How did he know that my
mom's belly button stuck out?

05:31.540 --> 05:35.704
W-We're going to try to get
as close to the scene as we can.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.755
What on earth could be going on?
I'm not certain of the details,

05:41.842 --> 05:45.255
but could it be that they are taking a time out?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.216
Maybe I'll go have a little fun.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.674
I can't just sit around here
waiting for three hours.

05:52.769 --> 05:57.388
Do as you wish. But Nappa,
don't let it get too out of hand.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.471
Why not?

05:58.567 --> 06:02.685
For the sake of the hell show
we'll be having in three hours.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.521
Oh, right, Vegeta.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.607
I'll keep it to just a
friendly greeting. Don't worry.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.951
One of the Saiyans has flown up into the air!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.079
Where in the world could he be headed?

06:21.923 --> 06:23.788
H-He seems to be headed in our direction,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.421
and is quickly drawing ever closer!

06:29.848 --> 06:32.009
H-He's coming after us!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.186
He's coming!

06:38.273 --> 06:40.013
Swing the camera around!

06:40.108 --> 06:42.394
R-Run!

06:42.486 --> 06:45.569
You're a blight! Get lost!

06:56.792 --> 07:00.501
By the way ["tsukanu koto"],
has Goku not arrived ["tsukanu"] yet?

07:02.589 --> 07:06.252
Regardless of how funny my gag was,
this is no time for laughs.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.005
The fate of Earth is at stake!

07:09.096 --> 07:11.087
Hurry, Son Goku!

07:15.268 --> 07:17.259
| see it!

07:17.354 --> 07:18.969
I'm almost there!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.523
Goku's presence?!

07:23.610 --> 07:27.774
Yeah. He's getting close!
He just might make it in time!

07:34.287 --> 07:37.404
One more hour, huh?

07:37.499 --> 07:41.788
Kakarrot isn't chickening out on us, is he?

07:43.630 --> 07:47.418
It's all or nothing. It looks
like that's all we can do.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.138
He's here! Son Goku is here!

07:55.225 --> 07:57.466
Kami-sama, quickly!

07:57.561 --> 07:59.847
It's the end of the Serpentine Road!

08:02.774 --> 08:05.811
T-That was fast! That was remarkably fast!

08:05.902 --> 08:10.441
Hmm? There's a powerful Ki,
divided into two! What's going on?!

08:10.532 --> 08:17.779
And so, three hours pass
without Goku showing up.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.285
It's time.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.912
Damn!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.830
It appears that waiting
for him didn't do any good.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.672
He's still not here?

08:32.761 --> 08:35.890
No, the coward Kakarrot has not come.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.681
My father is not a coward!

08:38.768 --> 08:41.726
Damn, why isn't he here?!

08:41.813 --> 08:44.475
Son Goku...

08:46.067 --> 08:49.651
Now then, to give them
a thorough working over...

08:49.738 --> 08:53.526
It's too bad we won't be able
to show this to Kakarrot.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.657
There's only once chance for
us to be able to beat this guy.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.116
Of course, that assumes that
everything goes smoothly.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.291
Listen up.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.289
First, Kuririn, you go after him

09:07.380 --> 09:10.463
and draw his attention as much as you can.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.793
Then, I'll find an opening and grab
his tail, the Saiyan's weak spot.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.719
O-Oh, right.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.263
Once he loses his strength,
and can't move anymore,

09:19.351 --> 09:22.718
Gohan, you wring out all the
power you've got and charge him.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.555
Right! I won't run away
this time, so it will be okay.

09:26.650 --> 09:31.895
Of course you won't. Remember that
the fate of Earth is in your hands.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.480
Gohan, have faith in yourself.
If you set your mind to it,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.816
your power is even greater than mine.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.458
All right...!

09:58.682 --> 10:00.343
--Goku!
--Kami-sama!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.264
Hurry! Grab on!

10:02.352 --> 10:03.717
If you please!

10:03.812 --> 10:10.274
T-That kid really did make it back
here from Kaio-sama's place.

10:12.279 --> 10:16.022
Okay, I'm off! My training went great!

10:16.116 --> 10:18.402
--We're counting on you!
--Good luck, Goku!

10:18.493 --> 10:19.949
Mm-hmm!

10:20.996 --> 10:25.239
Guys! Gohan! Please be alive!

10:26.626 --> 10:30.835
Here he comes! Son Goku is quite exhausted!

10:30.922 --> 10:33.413
Hey...!

10:33.508 --> 10:35.749
Karin-sama!

10:35.844 --> 10:39.302
My last two senzu beans! Here!

10:40.682 --> 10:41.842
Thank you!

10:41.933 --> 10:43.218
This really helps!

10:43.310 --> 10:45.096
We're counting on you!

10:45.186 --> 10:47.268
I'll use one right now!

10:52.777 --> 10:54.187
All right, full strength!

10:54.279 --> 10:56.440
Kinto Un!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.822
Long time no see!

10:59.909 --> 11:01.490
You're on!

11:01.578 --> 11:04.570
There's an incredible gathering of Ki!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.825
That way!

11:31.232 --> 11:32.312
All right,

11:32.400 --> 11:33.981
here goes!

11:36.905 --> 11:40.739
Ha! He's leading off by charging right at me!

11:43.578 --> 11:45.660
Draw his attention!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.624
Now!

11:54.339 --> 11:55.875
W-Why, you!

11:55.965 --> 11:57.626
Gohan!

12:02.013 --> 12:03.719
You fool!

12:11.481 --> 12:13.972
l-lmpossible...!

12:19.197 --> 12:21.313
P-Piccolo-san!

12:24.994 --> 12:28.532
Whoa, don't go dying, now!

12:28.623 --> 12:33.458
You still have to tell us
about the Dragon Balls.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.996
T-T-This can't be...!

12:39.592 --> 12:42.004
Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

12:42.095 --> 12:47.306
Did you think we would leave
our weakness untrained forever?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.724
That's a shame.

12:49.811 --> 12:53.099
The best fighter on this world,

12:53.189 --> 12:55.100
reduced to this with just one blow!

12:55.191 --> 12:56.806
P-Piccolo-san!

12:56.901 --> 12:58.892
Shake it off!

12:58.987 --> 13:03.572
Now then, while he's gone beddy-bye,

13:03.658 --> 13:06.741
I guess I'll play around with the little ones.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.747
I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

13:15.837 --> 13:20.581
Hey, you carry true Saiyan blood.

13:20.675 --> 13:24.463
You're bound to offer me a little fun, right?

13:39.402 --> 13:44.567
Hey, now, don't go croaking on me yet.
Play with me a little more!

13:56.836 --> 13:59.327
That's the spirit!

14:02.884 --> 14:04.840
You bastard!

14:14.979 --> 14:18.813
Ho... his movements,
at least, are something else.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.437
Let me show you something I've been saving!

15:00.358 --> 15:02.349
Kienzan!!

15:07.824 --> 15:09.780
What a sorry technique!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.443
Nappa! Dodge it!

15:27.510 --> 15:31.298
That idiot! Couldn't he tell
what kind of technique it was?!

15:31.389 --> 15:33.550
Damn...!

15:41.524 --> 15:44.561
W-Why, you...!

15:44.652 --> 15:49.942
How dare you... how dare you cut my face?!

15:55.371 --> 15:58.579
Get out of my sight!

16:07.467 --> 16:10.254
I'll finish you!

16:26.069 --> 16:29.186
You're awake already?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.942
Y-You punk!

16:34.202 --> 16:36.909
Looks like they're giving you trouble, Nappa!

16:36.996 --> 16:42.832
Don't you... don't you
look down on Earth, Saiyan!

16:44.295 --> 16:47.708
Why, you! Now I'm furious!

16:47.799 --> 16:51.087
l was going easy on you, since I can't kill you

16:51.177 --> 16:52.963
because of the Dragon Balls,

16:53.054 --> 16:55.136
and now you've gotten all full of yourself!

16:55.223 --> 16:58.181
You're the one who's full of himself!

16:59.727 --> 17:02.139
W-What is that Ki?!

17:02.230 --> 17:06.473
There's a tremendous Ki
heading here from far away!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.939
|-|t's true!

17:11.030 --> 17:15.319
An amazing, yet familiar Ki!

17:15.410 --> 17:20.996
N-No doubt about it... H can feel it...

17:21.082 --> 17:26.041
It can only be him! Son Goku!

17:28.464 --> 17:34.004
Just a little farther, Goku. Hurry. Hurry!

17:34.095 --> 17:37.587
It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!

17:37.682 --> 17:43.097
|-| just knew he would come!
Damn that punk for keeping us waiting!

17:43.187 --> 17:47.476
F-Father! Father is coming!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.523
Hurry! H urry!

17:50.945 --> 17:53.061
G-Goku...

17:53.156 --> 17:58.025
These guys have a strange power
by which they can sense presences.

17:58.119 --> 18:02.158
Is it Kakarrot? Let's see...

18:07.086 --> 18:08.747
They're close! I can feel it!

18:08.838 --> 18:13.548
Two huge Ki, and two even more
huge Ki! There's one small Ki!

18:13.634 --> 18:18.469
T-The numbers don't add up!
H-Has somebody died?!

18:18.556 --> 18:22.424
Kinto Un, hurry even faster!

18:27.023 --> 18:28.559
Vegeta,

18:28.649 --> 18:32.688
is what they're saying true?

18:32.779 --> 18:36.988
Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

18:37.074 --> 18:39.941
I don't know if it's Kakarrot or not,

18:40.036 --> 18:44.655
but somebody is going to be
here in about four minutes.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.037
Someone with a battle power of 5,000!

18:49.420 --> 18:53.880
5-5,000?! l-lmpossible!

18:53.966 --> 18:57.379
Nappa! Kill them!

18:57.470 --> 19:01.213
If the four of them team up together,
they could become a problem!

19:01.307 --> 19:03.719
They'll also serve as an example for Kakarrot!

19:03.810 --> 19:05.266
What?!

19:07.355 --> 19:10.188
B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

19:10.274 --> 19:13.562
No matter! I have an idea!

19:13.653 --> 19:16.816
If we go to that Namekian's
home world of Planet Namek,

19:16.906 --> 19:20.774
they're sure to have even more
powerful Dragon Balls there!

19:20.868 --> 19:23.109
I thought it was just a silly story,

19:23.204 --> 19:26.071
but if Kakarrot has really come back to life,

19:26.165 --> 19:29.828
then the legend is true after all!

19:29.919 --> 19:32.126
| get it. All right...

19:32.213 --> 19:34.704
I'll start with you!

19:34.799 --> 19:37.882
P-Piccolo-san! Run!

19:37.969 --> 19:41.553
I'll keep him busy somehow
until Father gets here!

19:41.639 --> 19:42.845
What?!

19:42.932 --> 19:47.346
After all, Piccolo-san, if you die,
then Kami-sama dies, too,

19:47.436 --> 19:49.392
and the Dragon Balls will be...

19:49.480 --> 19:52.096
What kind of nonsense is that?!

19:52.191 --> 19:55.604
There's no way you can
keep him busy all by yourself!

19:55.695 --> 20:00.780
Don't make me laugh! You little brat!

20:00.867 --> 20:02.357
No!

20:38.404 --> 20:43.615
You brat! You're through!

20:53.586 --> 20:55.417
O-Oh, no!

20:58.174 --> 21:01.291
Die!!

21:18.402 --> 21:22.441
This was an act that nobody had anticipated.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.989
What thoughts could have
crossed PiccoIo's mind?

21:26.077 --> 21:29.820
And will he live or die?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
FIy away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'II hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening que Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.478 --> 22:36.093
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.188 --> 22:38.474
One of the Ki is disappearing. It can't be...!

22:38.566 --> 22:40.773
T-This is all your fault, both father and son...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.226
Y-Your softness has worn off on me...

22:43.320 --> 22:47.154
PiccoIo-san, why?! Don't die, PiccoIo-san!

22:48.576 --> 22:51.067
You're gonna pay for this!

22:51.162 --> 22:52.902
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.997 --> 22:57.036
"Tears Shed by Piccolo...
Son Goku's Furious Counterattack!"

22:57.126 --> 22:59.913
Amazing! Father is so strong!
