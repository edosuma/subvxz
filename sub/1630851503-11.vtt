WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:05.539
Okay,
here's your food.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.309
Why is Becky
bringing you food?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.878
Darlene's ex-boyfriend's
new-agey vegan place

00:10.911 --> 00:12.213
is on my way home.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.481
Yeah, I love the food,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.649
but it would be way too awkward
to run into Nick.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.519
Well, I'm not
doing it anymore.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.021
It's full of people who think
natural deodorant works,

00:21.055 --> 00:22.856
but it doesn't.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.592
Their patchouli
disorients you

00:24.625 --> 00:26.727
so the B.O. can attach itself
to your clothes

00:26.760 --> 00:28.996
and follow you home.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.199
Oh, yeah.
It's on there.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.435
Why would it be awkward
for you to run into Nick?

00:34.468 --> 00:35.669
I'm gonna tell you

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
so that you don't make
the same dating mistakes

00:37.471 --> 00:39.373
that I did.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.409
Ben was a schmuck.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.278
And he baited me into a fight
that drove Nick away.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.613
Dad said
Nick broke up with you

00:45.646 --> 00:47.014
because you're
a black widow spider

00:47.047 --> 00:48.249
who sucks the souls
out of men

00:48.282 --> 00:50.418
and leaves their dreams
tangled in your web.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.054
Prove me wrong.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.389
You know what?

00:55.423 --> 00:58.292
I've had enough of you people
making a bad situation worse.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.294
Yes, I've had
terrible relationships.

01:00.328 --> 01:03.030
Thanks for reminding me
every minute of my waking life.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.765
I'm gonna go eat
in the living room.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.035
Wow.
She's really upset.

01:08.068 --> 01:12.072
She just needs to be alone
with her thoughts.

01:12.106 --> 01:15.143
I think we know
what we have to do.

01:15.176 --> 01:18.045
Oh, Darlene!

01:18.078 --> 01:20.148
Come here, big baby!

01:22.516 --> 01:25.486
<i>Captions by VITA</i> --

01:59.387 --> 02:02.156
Thank you so much for making
sandwiches for Aldo's boys.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.292
They're odd, but they're
actually pretty sweet.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.993
They like me now.
Be careful.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.796
They liked the hamster
before they decided to play

02:08.829 --> 02:11.465
"Hey, let's see how far
we can throw the hamster!"

02:13.367 --> 02:14.768
Sorry for barging in,
guys.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.036
Um, Harris,

02:16.069 --> 02:17.471
my dad just showed up
out of nowhere

02:17.505 --> 02:18.972
and wants to see the kids.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.208
Could you help me
get them packed up?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.775
Okay, well,
I'll come with you.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.976
I'd love to meet your dad.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.144
Not a good idea.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.347
See, the thing is,
he just wants to see the boys.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.216
He doesn't want to see you.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.485
I've been with those kids.
That's not the pick I'd make.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.053
Wait, what's his problem
with me?

02:33.086 --> 02:34.788
Have you told him
anything about me?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.123
Yeah, totally.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.791
I told him you're a hot
19-year-old

02:37.825 --> 02:39.327
who I met
at a tattoo parlor,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.496
and somehow, he spun that
into a bad thing.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.164
You gotta get this sorted out
before I move in,

02:44.198 --> 02:45.966
or it's gonna be weird
when he visits.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.803
Yeah, um, more bad news
on that front.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.305
Um...

02:51.339 --> 02:53.474
he's totally against
you moving in.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.842
What?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.143
That's insane.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.645
You're 38 years old.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.247
Why are you even
listening to him?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.748
He's my dad.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.916
I can't just shut him down
without hearing him out, babe.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.020
Look, let's see if we can
handle things differently

03:07.054 --> 03:08.856
with your dad
this time.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.724
Ask him to come over
and talk to me,

03:10.758 --> 03:12.025
geezer to geezer.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.427
Really?
You would do that?

03:13.461 --> 03:15.162
Yeah.
Thank you, Grandpa.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.897
Aww, that's super cool.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.069
I would have never
asked you to do that.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.238
I'd do anything to make
my granddaughter happy.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.040
And you remind me
of my younger self --

03:27.074 --> 03:29.877
an irresponsible dumbass.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.279
I was, uh --
I was talking to my friends

03:31.312 --> 03:33.914
down at the arcade,
and they said at 38,

03:33.947 --> 03:36.450
guys' brains aren't even
fully developed.

03:36.484 --> 03:39.152
Don't strain yourself, man.
Just take the compliment.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.392
I really needed
a chill movie night.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.026
Why do we have to sit
so close?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.228
Oh, Ben likes being
near the screen,

03:48.262 --> 03:50.331
and I guess
I got used to it.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.802
Well, that explains why
he's sitting with a date

03:54.835 --> 03:57.070
in the row
right in front of us.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.672
Oh, crap.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
Let's go.
No, no.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.810
I can handle this.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.946
Even though he busted up
my relationship with Nick,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.248
I'm gonna show him
that I am way healthier

04:08.282 --> 04:09.950
and I am fine
with him dating.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.084
Then how about this?

04:11.118 --> 04:14.254
We sit in the back
and lob Milk Duds at him.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.757
He'll never know
where they're coming from.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.092
No. But I-I-I have to
tell him I'm here.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.227
Otherwise, if he sees me,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.229
he's gonna think
I'm stalking him.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.165
Wait, is that why
we're here?

04:25.198 --> 04:26.667
Are you stalking him?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.136
No. If I were stalking him,
I wouldn't have brought you.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.671
You're super loud.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.476
Hey, there!

04:36.677 --> 04:38.812
Hey. Okay, well --

04:38.846 --> 04:40.180
I guess living
in a small town

04:40.213 --> 04:42.516
means this is gonna happen
once in a while.

04:42.550 --> 04:46.520
Especially at the
Lanford Monoplex.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.522
Darlene, this is Laura.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.459
Hi, I'm Darlene --
the ex.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.193
Oh, hello.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.595
Uh, sorry to bother you.
Yep.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.197
I just wanted Ben to know
this was a total accident...

04:57.230 --> 04:59.132
Oh.
...and I have no problem

04:59.166 --> 05:00.468
with him dating.
Oh.

05:00.501 --> 05:04.137
So, if you guys wanna
hold hands, go for it.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.374
I'm just gonna be
back here with Becky.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.377
Hey, Becky.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.644
Hi, Ben.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.281
So...

05:14.314 --> 05:15.649
enjoy the movie!

05:20.588 --> 05:22.790
What do you think?
Handled that well, right?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.057
Yeah.

05:24.091 --> 05:28.028
It was just the right amount
of excruciatingly awkward.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.463
Oh, man.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.264
What, you think I made
his date uncomfortable?

05:32.232 --> 05:34.001
Let me go fix that.
Darlene --

05:35.603 --> 05:37.538
Hi, Laura.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.907
My sister feels like
I made you uncomfortable.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.810
But don't be --
I am not stalking him.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.678
The only reason
we're at the same movie

05:44.712 --> 05:49.149
is because I love "Ghost World,"
so I turned him onto it.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.984
But you know what --
it's not like it's our movie.

05:51.018 --> 05:51.985
You know what?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.021
You can make it your movie.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.590
I gift you the movie.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.925
I mean, I'm still
gonna be back here,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.259
but you know what I mean.
Okay, thanks.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.762
Enjoy the movie.
You too.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.566
Okay.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.668
Done and done.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.169
You sure?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.571
You done?

06:11.905 --> 06:13.474
Good!

06:15.042 --> 06:17.110
I kinda like
his date's hair.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.548
I do, too.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.049
I should tell her.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.619
Hey, by the way...
Oh, my God.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.588
...I love your hair.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.722
I mean, just 'cause
I'm the ex

06:28.756 --> 06:31.124
doesn't mean I can't
enjoy your style, right?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.125
Y-You know what?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.761
We should get coffee sometime.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.464
Talk about this guy, huh?
Darlene.

06:36.497 --> 06:40.133
Darlene, just stop
talking to us.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.736
Stop talking to her.
Stop talking to me.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.738
Just -- On behalf
of people everywhere,

06:44.772 --> 06:46.607
stop talking.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.608
Sorry.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.043
I am very, very sorry.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.479
Let's just go
somewhere else

06:51.512 --> 06:53.747
where they don't
let crazy people in.

06:58.486 --> 07:01.154
I can't believe
you didn't stop me.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.791
I told you we should leave!

07:03.824 --> 07:05.593
I told you
you couldn't handle it!

07:05.626 --> 07:07.127
I told you
we should sit in the back

07:07.160 --> 07:08.929
and throw Milk Duds at him!

07:08.962 --> 07:11.732
Shh!
I told you you were loud.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.442
Remember, Harris really
wants this to work out.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.112
Aldo's dad is here,
so be nice.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.315
When the hell am I not nice?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.919
Hey.
Hey! You must be Jesse.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.120
I'm Dan. Come on in.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.254
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.256
And I'm Harris' aunt,
Jackie.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.325
Oh, it's so sweet of you
to bring beer.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.360
It's really refreshing
to see somebody

07:40.393 --> 07:43.130
who doesn't show up
to the door empty-handed.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.765
Oh, I just
brought these for me

07:44.798 --> 07:47.200
'cause I didn't know
what kind you guys have.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.604
You get used to something,
you want it all the time.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.641
It's kinda like
your favorite pickle.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.676
I get it.
I like gherkins.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.611
You can put one
between your cheek and gum

07:57.645 --> 08:00.648
and have your own
secret little treat.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.685
Well, I will leave you men
to talk about your pickles.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.954
I'd stay,
but, uh, I have an appointment

08:06.987 --> 08:08.488
with my psychic.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.724
Aldo's mom was a psychic!

08:10.758 --> 08:12.325
No wait, psy-- psy--

08:12.359 --> 08:13.360
psychotic.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.162
I get those confused.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.801
Why don't we take this
in the kitchen?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.537
I'd be a bad host
if I let you drink alone.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.573
Yeah, you would.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.309
Oh, I didn't know
you had that kind.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.844
I'll take one.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.647
I'll put these back
in my truck.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.515
My gas gauge doesn't work,

08:35.549 --> 08:38.351
so I like to have
emergency "walking beer"

08:38.385 --> 08:40.453
for when the truck
stops coasting.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.624
Good plan.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.927
So...

08:47.861 --> 08:49.597
I hear tell you don't think
it's a good idea

08:49.630 --> 08:51.765
for Harris to move in
with your son.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.102
No, I think
it's a terrible idea.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.104
She's not
the right woman for him.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.639
Hey, you got
anything crunchy?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.242
Just our milk. Listen.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.611
You and I
have been alive long enough

09:03.644 --> 09:05.445
to be a good judge
of people.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.949
Harris isn't just
some irresponsible dropout.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.283
She pays rent.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.453
She's got a steady job.
She's a solid person.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.089
Way I see it,
Aldo is damn lucky to have her.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.458
I didn't say she's bad.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.427
I said she's not right.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.129
I'm a roofer, Dan.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.363
And like a lot of roofers,

09:23.396 --> 09:26.600
a couple bees chased me
off a two-story

09:26.634 --> 09:29.637
into a wheelbarrow
full of bricks.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.080
Were the bees mad 'cause
your story didn't have a point?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.081
I'm getting there.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.316
I'm a storyteller, Dan.

09:43.350 --> 09:48.121
Anyway, a man needs
a woman he can count on.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.959
And Aldo's mom, Marlene --

09:51.992 --> 09:56.496
she was there for me
after the accident.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.465
She taught me
how to read and write

09:58.498 --> 10:01.268
and play harmonica again.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.770
You're a lucky man.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.005
That must have been
before she went psychotic.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.174
No, that happened

10:07.207 --> 10:09.609
right after I slept
with her sister.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.746
Oh.
I told her --

10:12.780 --> 10:14.614
I told her
it was dark, and --

10:14.648 --> 10:17.484
and they're pretty much
the same height.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.321
She came at me
with the rake anyway.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.392
You never know what's gonna
set a woman off.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.996
But bottom line is,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.131
what you and I think...

10:31.164 --> 10:32.532
don't mean squat.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.634
Harris and Aldo are adults.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.303
You can't tell 'em
what to do.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.106
Aldo's not an adult, Dan.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.274
It's painful for me
to say this,

10:41.308 --> 10:44.011
'cause they never set
my jaw right...

10:45.813 --> 10:47.948
...but he...

10:47.981 --> 10:51.685
is a 38-year-old
man-baby

10:51.719 --> 10:54.387
who still likes to
jump up and down on the bed

10:54.421 --> 10:56.123
in the morning.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.992
He still watches
"Blue's Clues."

11:00.360 --> 11:03.030
He never fell off a --
a roof or nothin'.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.598
That's just the way he is.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.369
Wait, I-I'm confused.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.637
Harris isn't the problem.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.306
You're saying Aldo isn't
mature enough for her.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.675
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.978
You heard about
the first wife, right?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.647
Only that she was
a drug addict.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.315
Not at the beginning.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.351
The woman had
a Master's degree.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.520
When Aldo and those creepy kids
were done with her...

11:28.688 --> 11:31.358
...she was smokin' rock
under a bridge

11:31.391 --> 11:33.426
and talking to her foot.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.732
If you give a crap
about your granddaughter...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.803
...you gotta get her
out of this.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.972
Wow.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.541
Thanks, Jesse.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.344
I know it must be hard
for a parent

11:51.378 --> 11:53.646
to see their kid
the way they really are.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.784
I'll talk to Harris.

11:56.817 --> 12:00.387
Good.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.090
Um, can I siphon some gas

12:03.123 --> 12:05.225
out of your lawnmower
to get home?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.196
I'm sorry, man.
I don't have a lawnmower.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.766
All right, uh, why don't you
just give me ten bucks

12:12.800 --> 12:14.701
and we'll call it even?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.103
How about this --
you give me 20

12:16.136 --> 12:17.604
and I'll owe you 10.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.906
Nice.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.941
I'm gonna remember that one.

12:31.518 --> 12:35.388
So, I just spent 45 minutes
on the phone with Laura

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
trying to convince her

12:36.656 --> 12:40.660
that it is safe
to go on another date with me.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.996
Why did you do that?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.832
I was just trying
to show you

12:44.865 --> 12:46.466
that I was cool
with you dating.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.902
I'll tell her.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
Hey, Siri?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.272
Call Laura.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.440
<i>Calling Laura.</i>

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
God, no!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.119
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

13:06.153 --> 13:09.322
I didn't expect
to see you with somebody.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.624
And it caught me
a little off-guard,

13:11.658 --> 13:15.195
and I went too far
in front of your new girlfriend.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.531
Is she your new girlfriend?

13:18.565 --> 13:23.103
Is that what that insanity
at the theater was all about?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.673
Trying to figure out
how serious I am about Laura?

13:26.706 --> 13:29.609
No, absolutely not.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.679
But obviously, you're dying
to tell me, so go ahead.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.050
We've only been
on three dates, okay?

13:37.084 --> 13:40.287
So I don't know
where it's going.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.689
Actually, two, 'cause she's not
letting me count last night

13:42.722 --> 13:45.592
'cause of, you know,
the "tiny lunatic."

13:47.494 --> 13:48.962
Sorry.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.830
It's hard.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.232
I know.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.341
So?

14:01.374 --> 14:03.476
Is she a nice person?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.179
Yeah, I like her.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.848
You know, she's easy
to be with.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.352
Well, that must be
a nice change of pace, huh?

14:14.587 --> 14:16.356
You know,
you go through stuff,

14:16.389 --> 14:19.626
and you figure out
what you want.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.097
I think I want easy.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.853
Hey.
Hey.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.922
Don't tell the kids
we went sledding.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.224
Everything's more fun
without them.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.425
Whew!

14:52.459 --> 14:54.094
Dad pulled me
behind his truck!

14:54.127 --> 14:56.296
Yeah, the exhaust
makes you giddy,

14:56.329 --> 14:58.999
and the intersections
are a real rush.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.734
Sounds like fun.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.603
Ah, she's gonna ruin
our buzz.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.972
I know it.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.773
Let's get out quick.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.108
It's too late.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.476
She's seen us.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.911
What's wrong?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.947
Ben was just over here.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.549
Ah, he come to read you
the riot act?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.417
He said
he doesn't want to be

15:17.450 --> 15:18.986
with someone like me
anymore.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.654
Well, he -- he did
leave you some clues --

15:21.688 --> 15:23.123
the breakup, uh,

15:23.156 --> 15:26.893
his devastating rejection
of your proposal,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.795
his moving on
with another woman.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.264
I mean, individually,
it doesn't seem like much,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.666
but when you put it
all together...

15:35.768 --> 15:38.238
No, I know that.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.574
I guess when I started
my spiritual journey,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.943
on some level,
I thought when I was, like,

15:43.977 --> 15:46.779
the new, improved Darlene,
I could get him back.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.116
There's no reason
that can't happen.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.018
Yeah, there is.
He wants easy.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.119
I'm never gonna be that.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.820
I'm always gonna be hard.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.159
I freakin' told you
she'd kill our buzz!

15:59.192 --> 16:01.228
Damn it!

16:02.895 --> 16:04.297
So? I'm dying to know.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.465
How'd it go
with Aldo's dad?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.167
I'll tell you.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.336
But watch the game with me.
Okay, but I'm starving.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.703
I'm gonna grab a yogurt.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.705
Uh, while you're in there,
could you grab some chips...

16:12.739 --> 16:14.941
Mm-hmm.
...and decide
not to stay with Aldo

16:14.974 --> 16:17.210
'cause you're too young for him
and he's too immature

16:17.244 --> 16:19.312
and I don't want to see you
throw your life away?

16:19.346 --> 16:21.114
Appreciate it.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.283
What are you talking about?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.385
I thought you were okay
with me and Aldo.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.154
What happened yesterday?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.790
Sorry -- I know we spent
a lot of time

16:30.823 --> 16:32.959
detailing the Maserati,
but unfortunately,

16:32.992 --> 16:35.162
we're not going
to race slot cars today.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.465
'Cause I just found out
my dad convinced your grandpa

16:38.498 --> 16:39.732
we shouldn't be together

16:39.766 --> 16:41.934
when he should've
worked it out with me, <i>Dad.</i>

16:43.170 --> 16:45.372
Hi, I'm Jesse.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.640
And I'm Harris,
and I really don't appreciate

16:47.674 --> 16:50.009
you butting into our lives!

16:50.043 --> 16:52.212
I was attacked by bees.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.780
You don't scare me.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.585
Okay, I-I-I-I think
we all need to sit down

16:58.618 --> 17:00.720
and have a respectful
conversation.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.823
So everybody shut
your dumb old pie-holes

17:03.856 --> 17:05.658
and listen to me!

17:05.692 --> 17:07.927
First of all,
watch your mouth.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.262
I'm not dumb.

17:09.296 --> 17:13.366
Second of all, my hole
also enjoys cakes and donuts.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.002
I-I'm sorry, sir.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.904
My father should not have
come over here

17:17.937 --> 17:20.107
and told you that
I'm some kinda loser

17:20.140 --> 17:22.209
who's gonna screw up
Harris' life.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.943
I'm looking at this
differently, son.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.345
I just don't think
Harris is ready

17:25.378 --> 17:27.614
to take on everything
you've got going on.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.216
Can everyone stop
talking about me

17:29.249 --> 17:31.851
like I'm not in the room and
making decisions about my life?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.220
I can speak for myself.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.088
Sure, but I just don't think
you ought to be playing mother

17:35.122 --> 17:36.623
to three kids.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.225
I only have two.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.794
Oh.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.062
Yeah.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.234
How hard do you
really want to fight

17:47.267 --> 17:49.702
when this is the prize?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.271
I'll show you how hard.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.206
I don't care
what any of you say.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.574
I'm moving in
with Aldo and the boys,

17:54.607 --> 17:56.109
and it's gonna be great.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.610
That's right.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.212
Harris is moving in
with me,

17:59.246 --> 18:00.780
and it starts now.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.250
And I don't need
anybody's approval!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.118
How'd I do, baby?
You did great.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.420
Yes!
Let's get the rest
of my stuff.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.126
Well, Dan,
it looks like you and me

18:13.160 --> 18:16.163
are probably gonna end up
being in-laws.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.664
Yeah.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.936
And now my boy's mad at me,
I don't have any place to stay.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.341
And, uh, since we're
practically in-laws...

18:28.375 --> 18:29.776
I hear you, Jesse.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.778
And if I didn't like you
so damn much,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.980
I wouldn't be offering you
this here beer

18:34.013 --> 18:36.449
for your walking journey.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.750
Gee, thanks.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.786
One will get me
out to the porch,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.455
two will get me
out of the yard.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.856
See ya.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.668
Oh, wow.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.036
I thought it was kids
playing a joke,

18:57.069 --> 18:58.137
'cause when I looked
through the peephole,

18:58.171 --> 19:00.607
there was nobody there.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.542
If you could jump up and down
next time,

19:02.575 --> 19:04.944
then I'd know
the place isn't haunted.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.546
I brought you something.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.315
Oh!

19:08.348 --> 19:10.149
That's nice.
Come on in.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.387
Wow!

19:14.421 --> 19:16.689
Very cute place.
Eh?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.124
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.792
I mean, it's still
a work in progress, you know?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.294
I'm still trying
to figure out

19:21.328 --> 19:23.963
which wall to hang
my Smash Mouth poster on.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.799
Oh, well, uh,
your closets have walls.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.835
I'd go with one of those.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.638
So, this whole visit's
for the plant?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.206
And to say thank you.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.974
Uh, you were honest
with me,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.009
and it helped me
be honest with myself.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.045
You've moved on,
you got your own place,

19:39.078 --> 19:40.847
and I gotta do
the same thing.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.382
Well, good for you.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.884
And thanks for
the housewarming gift.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.386
Oh. Yeah.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.120
It's really more
of a goodbye gift.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.324
Really?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.925
Y-You know I work
with your dad

19:52.959 --> 19:55.562
and spend a lot of time
with your kid.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.096
I will be coming over
to the house,

19:57.129 --> 19:58.731
so it's not really goodbye.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.334
I mean, unless you're here
to kill me.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.471
I don't think it's
the right move at this time.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.408
It's not a physical goodbye.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.310
It's an emotional one.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.449
Right.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.552
Well, I hope
everything works out.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.188
And when you find a place,
I'm gonna come over

20:22.221 --> 20:24.757
with a $4 plant I got
from the drugstore, too.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.894
Oh, that's $2 more
than I spent.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.297
I'm saving up
for a house here, so...

20:40.307 --> 20:41.941
♪ I'm going up

20:41.974 --> 20:43.910
♪ He's going up

20:43.943 --> 20:45.244
♪ Going down

20:45.278 --> 20:46.579
♪ He's going down

20:46.613 --> 20:50.082
