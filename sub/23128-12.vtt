WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.592
- Previously on
Being Human...

00:02.630 --> 00:06.066
- I don't care
if it's a bad idea.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.990
- I want you to turn me
into what you are.

00:11.770 --> 00:14.637
- Why did you do this to me?

00:14.680 --> 00:16.239
- Kenny...

00:16.280 --> 00:19.671
- What if we got married now
so Sally could be there?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.779
- I'm here long enough
to grab my brother

00:21.820 --> 00:23.948
and take him out
for a bachelor party.

00:23.990 --> 00:24.889
(Screams)

00:24.920 --> 00:27.014
Aidan called you a werewolf!

00:27.060 --> 00:27.913
- Emily!

00:27.960 --> 00:30.054
- Does Nora know?
- She's one too.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.294
- When you die,
your soul is mine.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.593
(Yells)

00:35.630 --> 00:38.019
Now what are we going
to do with you?

00:38.070 --> 00:39.663
- I have no
chance against her.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.634
- You are
incredibly powerful!

00:41.670 --> 00:43.263
- What do I do
when I see Donna?

00:43.310 --> 00:44.664
- How's your Latin?

00:44.710 --> 00:47.031
I banish you from--

00:47.080 --> 00:49.174
- I'm so screwed!

00:51.150 --> 00:53.141
(Liquid bubbling)

01:16.510 --> 01:18.604
Please, let me go!

01:18.640 --> 01:20.972
Please, let me live!

01:21.010 --> 01:24.878
- This body was never
yours, not really.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.810
(Whimpering)

01:27.850 --> 01:30.683
I came through on
my end of our bargain.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.686
It's your turn, Sally.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.154
- No!

01:35.190 --> 01:36.919
NO!

01:54.510 --> 01:59.676
"Veneficus absum,
levare velum."

02:03.820 --> 02:05.584
(Exhales sharply)

02:05.620 --> 02:08.715
(Woman):
* You were the coal

02:08.759 --> 02:10.649
* She was the fire

02:10.690 --> 02:14.729
* That warmed your skin

02:14.760 --> 02:17.661
* And all within

02:17.700 --> 02:19.998
* Memories to hold

02:20.040 --> 02:23.101
* Her trembling fingers

02:23.140 --> 02:26.269
* Held all they'd know...

02:26.310 --> 02:27.471
- Hey there.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.932
- Hello.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.620
- What do you say
we get married today?

02:32.650 --> 02:34.869
- What kind of couple
gets married

02:34.920 --> 02:36.740
on a random
Thursday afternoon?

02:36.790 --> 02:40.010
- The same kind that spends
the night before their wedding

02:40.060 --> 02:43.223
in a queen bed
with mismatched sheets

02:43.260 --> 02:46.230
instead of separate suites
at the Four Seasons.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.399
- You're sure
you're still OK with this?

02:48.430 --> 02:50.626
The complete lack of fanfare?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.695
- We've got the essentials:

02:52.740 --> 02:56.734
a case of champagne and
our best friends in the world.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.203
- Hmm...

03:04.280 --> 03:05.702
- Josh...

03:05.750 --> 03:07.149
(Sighs)

03:08.350 --> 03:11.342
- Without Emily here,
there--there's no one.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.954
There's no ties
to who I used to be.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.652
- You kept your distance
for years.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.885
<i>- I know.</i>

03:18.930 --> 03:21.297
- Emily found
her way back to you.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.367
It takes a minute.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.139
You know...

03:30.170 --> 03:31.831
(Sighs)

03:31.870 --> 03:34.271
...to accept the existence

03:34.310 --> 03:36.972
of literal monsters.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.945
Took me a minute.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.384
Now I'm marrying your ass.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.950
* Love burns

03:48.990 --> 03:51.049
She'll find her way back.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.593
* Through the night

03:53.630 --> 03:54.825
* Burns

03:54.860 --> 03:56.828
- We're getting married today.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.065
(Chuckles)

03:58.100 --> 03:59.590
What's wrong with you?
- Ha ha ha!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.835
- You're a crazy person!

04:00.870 --> 04:02.759
You're crazy!
- Ah!

04:02.810 --> 04:05.859
* Through the night

04:05.910 --> 04:10.848
* Burn, yeah

04:10.880 --> 04:13.076
(Vocalizing)

04:19.250 --> 04:20.786
(Exhales sharply)

04:30.630 --> 04:33.361
(Birds chirping, horn honking)

04:38.910 --> 04:40.378
Oh...

04:44.610 --> 04:45.975
(Sighs)

04:48.380 --> 04:49.939
- It wasn't me!

04:57.590 --> 04:58.785
- Thank you.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.889
- Why is it that
I'm less surprised

05:00.930 --> 05:02.864
about your mastery of
Jewish wedding tradition

05:02.900 --> 05:05.824
than I am about someone else
cooking food in my kitchen?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.338
- It's a tiny
wedding, Josh.

05:07.370 --> 05:10.067
You're looking at the officiate,
but also the caterer.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.600
Get the hell away from me!

05:11.640 --> 05:13.734
- How did the whole ordainment
situation come about?

05:13.780 --> 05:17.000
I mean, if you attended some
Restoration divinity school

05:17.050 --> 05:18.040
in the 19th century,

05:18.080 --> 05:19.514
I'm gonna feel super fancy.

05:19.550 --> 05:20.972
- The Universal Life Church.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.580
Over 20 million ordained
on ye olde interweb.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.587
(Laughs)

05:24.620 --> 05:26.281
(Doorbell rings)

05:27.960 --> 05:30.884
I like it good and crispy,
Reverend!

05:34.930 --> 05:38.093
- Is it too early to get drunk
and pretty? Or pretty drunk?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.894
- You're here, right now!

05:39.940 --> 05:42.932
- When my friend says she's
getting married in 24 hours,

05:42.970 --> 05:44.199
I tend to show up!

05:44.240 --> 05:46.470
- Of course, yes!
Come put your stuff down.

05:46.510 --> 05:49.400
Are you hungry?
Aidan made breakfast.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.248
- Did you tell him
you invited me?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.944
- Well, we're not exactly in
seating chart territory here.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.812
- OK, I was gonna wait
to tell you this

05:56.850 --> 06:00.013
when we were in the makeup
application part of the day.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.812
(Clears throat)

06:01.860 --> 06:06.229
Aidan and I were together the
other night for our first time.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.859
- That's so great!

06:08.900 --> 06:11.562
- It was great, until...

06:11.600 --> 06:14.467
I woke up and he was gone!

06:15.300 --> 06:17.610
Yeah, I thought those mornings
were behind me,

06:17.640 --> 06:21.133
when dates stopped consisting of
a six-pack and a few bong hits.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.706
- You should give him
a chance to explain.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.240
- Really?

06:25.280 --> 06:28.841
- Aidan's a good guy.
Or, you know, he tries to be.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.609
You could do a lot worse.

06:30.650 --> 06:32.857
(Indistinct talking)

06:32.890 --> 06:35.257
Kat's here, for the wedding!

06:35.290 --> 06:37.349
- Josh ruined the bacon,
not me. Hi!

06:38.160 --> 06:39.992
It's nice to see you again.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.795
- Why don't I take
your stuff upstairs

06:42.830 --> 06:47.893
and... you just come up
whenever you're ready?

06:48.740 --> 06:50.105
Caterer.

07:00.780 --> 07:02.009
Sally?

07:02.050 --> 07:04.747
Do you wanna come down--

07:04.790 --> 07:06.519
Sally?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.119
(Panting)

07:08.920 --> 07:10.979
(Exhales sharply)

07:12.060 --> 07:14.028
- I don't think
I have much longer.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.949
(Sobs)

07:16.000 --> 07:18.298
Nora, I don't think
I can do this!

07:18.330 --> 07:21.300
- Oh my God!
Sally, you're...

07:21.340 --> 07:25.129
- Rotting from the inside out?
Pretty much.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.105
- Oh my God!

07:27.140 --> 07:29.074
- Well, the good news is,

07:29.110 --> 07:32.671
I no longer have the urge
to eat your face.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.909
- Sally, you should have
told me how bad it had gotten,

07:37.950 --> 07:39.486
told someone!

07:43.030 --> 07:45.351
- Nora, it's
your wedding day,

07:45.390 --> 07:49.759
and it should be about roses and
peonies and dye-to-match shoes,

07:49.800 --> 07:53.566
not about rotting flesh
or blood-magic sacrifices.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.637
- Uh, have you met us?

07:55.670 --> 07:57.809
It wouldn't be
a union of werewolves

07:57.840 --> 07:59.535
without a little
blood-magic

07:59.580 --> 08:00.877
sacrifice drama.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.105
(Laughs)

08:02.140 --> 08:03.801
I'd never wear
dye-to-match shoes!

08:03.850 --> 08:05.602
- Oh, thank God!

08:05.650 --> 08:09.348
- The whole reason that we
wanted to get married today

08:09.380 --> 08:11.109
was so you could be here.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.517
(Swallows, chuckles)

08:17.260 --> 08:20.093
- OK, I'm sorry. I--

08:20.130 --> 08:21.894
- No, me first.

08:21.930 --> 08:25.969
I came here today to watch
my friends get married,

08:26.000 --> 08:27.695
not to play
some moronic game

08:27.740 --> 08:30.539
where I tart myself up
in some tight dress

08:30.570 --> 08:33.210
and give you the
silent treatment and--

08:33.240 --> 08:36.642
Just to prove my status
as a girl who can hang.

08:37.679 --> 08:38.841
(Exhales sharply)

08:38.880 --> 08:40.644
But I'm--I'm not
gonna pretend

08:40.679 --> 08:43.980
that what happened between us
didn't mean anything.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.283
(Sighs)

08:45.320 --> 08:48.517
So just... tell me why.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.652
Tell me how you feel,
right now.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.589
Just... get it over with.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.290
- OK.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.766
Things got really real
between us, really fast.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.269
And I completely freaked out.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.478
It's been a long time
since I have

09:08.510 --> 09:12.071
been with someone like you.

09:12.110 --> 09:15.546
- Yeah,
alarmingly direct...

09:16.550 --> 09:20.111
- And grounded, and smart...

09:21.720 --> 09:23.358
and special.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.621
Will you be my date to
my best friend's wedding?

09:26.660 --> 09:27.559
(Chuckles)

09:27.600 --> 09:29.295
- As long as
you acknowledge

09:29.330 --> 09:32.265
that this further accelerates
our relationship

09:32.300 --> 09:34.064
at an abnormally rapid pace.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.659
- It's a deal.
- OK.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.665
- (Nora): Aidan?

09:39.780 --> 09:42.704
Could you come with me
in the kitchen for a second?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.149
- Sure thing.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.918
- What are we gonna do?

09:48.950 --> 09:52.784
The wedding's in 4 hours,
we have a house full of...

09:52.820 --> 09:54.219
guest.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.080
(Sighs)

09:56.890 --> 09:58.654
- We be there for Sally.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.819
We say our goodbyes

10:01.860 --> 10:05.194
and hope that
they're not our last.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.834
(Sighs)

10:07.870 --> 10:09.338
- Kat, what about Kat?

10:09.370 --> 10:11.805
- Yeah! Nora, you're gonna
have to get rid of her.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.877
Look, an incubating
vampire is one thing.

10:13.910 --> 10:16.880
I know how much time Kenny
needs before he's gonna wake up.

10:16.910 --> 10:19.675
But, I mean, my very human
girlfriend sharing the house

10:19.720 --> 10:21.745
with a reanimated
corpse that's near death?

10:21.780 --> 10:23.885
I don't know, maybe
that's pushing our luck!

10:23.920 --> 10:26.412
- I'm sorry, did you
just say your girlfriend?

10:26.450 --> 10:27.781
- I caught that too.

10:27.820 --> 10:30.824
- I don't know.
Maybe she's my girlfriend!

10:31.730 --> 10:33.755
Oh, come on!
Why would you do this now?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.155
- I'm not doing anything.
I smiled at you.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.725
- OK, I'll take care of it.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.908
- Listen, you've already died
once and survived it, right?

10:46.940 --> 10:50.444
I can't believe that sentence
just came out of my mouth.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.245
- It's not even my body
I care about,

10:53.280 --> 10:56.716
especially now, in its
current, nasty condition.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.788
The deal that I made with
Donna was for my soul.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.380
- Right! That's why
you have to fight!

11:02.420 --> 11:05.253
- How? How am I gonna--

11:05.290 --> 11:07.759
Ilana gave me this...

11:07.800 --> 11:09.199
incantation.

11:09.230 --> 11:10.994
But the only Latin
I understand is

11:11.030 --> 11:12.668
from freaking
Dead Poets Society!

11:12.700 --> 11:15.135
And when Nick and Stevie
went through that door,

11:15.170 --> 11:16.934
who knows what
happened to them?

11:16.970 --> 11:19.530
It could all be over by
the time I say: "Veneficus."

11:19.570 --> 11:21.902
- You won't kill the witch
with that attitude!

11:21.940 --> 11:22.907
- Let me see that.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.202
- What I'm saying is,

11:24.250 --> 11:25.809
maybe I just don't
go through the door.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.069
- I don't think
that you have a choice.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.715
Sally, you made a deal with
a practitioner of black magic.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.811
People have fallen prey to
blood offerings for centuries

11:34.860 --> 11:38.421
because it's not something you
can just trick your way out of!

11:38.460 --> 11:40.098
Donna will have
made sure of it

11:40.130 --> 11:42.929
that you are going through
that door no matter what,

11:42.970 --> 11:44.165
whether you want to or not.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.567
So your only choice
is to end her.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.809
- I-- Josh,
you've seen Donna.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.231
You watched her bring
a dead body back to life!

11:53.280 --> 11:54.907
That's an unnatural power!

11:54.940 --> 11:57.841
- Then I'm going with you.
- You can't.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.974
- Oh, please don't
argue with me!

12:00.020 --> 12:02.842
- You can't because
that door is for spirits:

12:02.890 --> 12:04.745
Nick, Stevie,
me in a few hours.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.420
- No, it's not. I mean, Donna's
door isn't for ghosts moving on.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.121
It's just another spell.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.993
- It doesn't appear when you've
resolved your issues on Earth.

12:13.030 --> 12:15.658
It appears when the witch
wants an audience with you!

12:15.700 --> 12:18.067
So it's a portal
to wherever she is!

12:18.100 --> 12:19.659
- Like a delivery system.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.590
Like the T, only with
less staphylococcus.

12:25.070 --> 12:28.574
- Wherever that door leads,
I might not come back.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.472
And I can't ask you

12:30.510 --> 12:32.604
to make that kind
of sacrifice.

12:32.650 --> 12:35.972
- Hey, two against one
is always better odds.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.583
(Exhales sharply)

12:48.200 --> 12:49.793
(Sighs)

12:51.130 --> 12:53.599
- Aidan's going with her.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.693
When the time comes...

12:57.540 --> 12:59.099
He's so confident,

12:59.140 --> 13:01.905
but he has no idea what's on
the other side of that door.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.010
No one does.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.247
No matter how many
witches he's come across

13:06.280 --> 13:08.476
in the past 200-plus years,

13:08.520 --> 13:12.388
he didn't see Donna rub
pulsed heart onto bone

13:12.420 --> 13:14.013
and make a real girl.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.849
Only you and I had
that distinct pleasure.

13:17.890 --> 13:19.380
- What we did, Josh,

13:19.430 --> 13:20.795
it's what anyone,

13:20.830 --> 13:24.721
any friend in our situation
would've done.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.329
- If we'd known,

13:26.370 --> 13:29.032
then we'd be here.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.005
Should we have left
her in the ground?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.148
- You need to go with them...

13:37.180 --> 13:38.341
Don't you?

13:38.380 --> 13:41.816
- No. This is our wedding.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.209
This was supposed
to be our wedding day.

13:48.390 --> 13:52.850
When I told you I would always
choose you, I meant it.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.390
- I know that.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.689
But the reason that I chose you

13:58.730 --> 14:00.789
is because you're
the kind of guy

14:00.840 --> 14:04.401
who can only think of
helping his friend right now.

14:08.010 --> 14:12.049
And it's why I'm gonna marry you
when you come home.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.445
(Sighs)

14:16.520 --> 14:18.784
- If I come home.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.421
(Coughing)

14:28.000 --> 14:29.092
- Is it time?

14:29.130 --> 14:30.097
(Coughs)

14:30.130 --> 14:31.859
- No, it's not time!

14:31.900 --> 14:33.891
This isn't a
World War II romance

14:33.940 --> 14:35.760
and I do not
have consumption.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.770
If you ask me that again, I'm
gonna flash some tattered flesh.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.006
- Oh!
- Ah, come on!

14:41.040 --> 14:43.372
- You like that?
- No, I don't like it!

14:43.410 --> 14:44.502
- OK.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.541
So for the last
couple of weeks,

14:46.580 --> 14:48.719
since we all realized that...

14:49.520 --> 14:52.114
that your body was...

14:52.150 --> 14:54.118
on its way out...

14:54.160 --> 14:55.616
- That's very delicate.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.152
- ...I've been
doing some shopping.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.749
A lot of shopping.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.019
If Sally's gonna
be haunting us again,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.767
I want her to look
damn good doing it!

15:05.800 --> 15:06.722
- YES!

15:06.770 --> 15:08.295
- (Aidan): Seriously?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.762
- He means:
"Yay, dresses!”

15:09.800 --> 15:12.735
- All right, out,
both of you!

15:15.880 --> 15:19.976
(Man):
* Bury me with my guitar

15:21.750 --> 15:25.744
* Bury me with my records

15:26.750 --> 15:28.787
* Where I am going

15:28.820 --> 15:31.949
* I'm gonna need
* something to do

15:31.990 --> 15:35.620
* Bury me with my guitar

15:37.170 --> 15:40.993
* Bury me with
* my best T-shirt

15:42.300 --> 15:45.736
* Bury me with my Chucks

15:47.310 --> 15:48.835
* Where I am going

15:48.880 --> 15:51.872
* I'm gonna need
* something to wear

15:51.910 --> 15:56.746
* Bury me with
* my black T-shirt

15:57.790 --> 15:59.315
* Nothing ever changes

15:59.350 --> 16:02.456
* I'll be happier
* than hell in Hell

16:02.490 --> 16:03.958
(Both giggling)

16:03.990 --> 16:05.788
* Waiting for
* my friends and family

16:05.830 --> 16:07.423
- Oh!

16:07.460 --> 16:08.450
(Panting)

16:08.500 --> 16:10.059
Sit down.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.193
Are you OK?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.566
- It's time.

16:29.850 --> 16:32.512
I have something for you.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.051
For your wedding.

16:35.090 --> 16:38.583
- So you'll give it to me
when you come back.

16:39.390 --> 16:40.789
- Top drawer.

16:48.770 --> 16:52.308
It's a thaali,
my grandmother's.

16:52.340 --> 16:55.901
Indian women wear it to
symbolize the bond of marriage.

16:55.940 --> 16:59.274
He would've put it on me
at our wedding...

17:00.280 --> 17:01.816
Danny.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.143
Or Max.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.210
It's your
"something borrowed".

17:09.260 --> 17:11.126
- Thank you.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.619
- Somebody say
something, please!

17:16.660 --> 17:18.162
Come on, guys.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.864
I never got a deathbed vigil
my first time around.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.500
Make an impassioned speech!

17:28.540 --> 17:29.905
(Chuckles)

17:29.940 --> 17:34.070
Hold my skeletal
meat hook of a hand.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.244
- I'm so sorry.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.214
I never even
gave you a choice.

17:42.260 --> 17:46.128
- Josh, this is what
I would've chosen.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.167
I got to be me again!

17:51.170 --> 17:52.490
(Chuckles)

17:52.530 --> 17:56.398
I got an electric blue manicure
just because I could!

17:56.440 --> 17:58.238
(Chuckles)

17:58.270 --> 18:01.308
I tried black and
white cookies again.

18:02.680 --> 18:07.004
And Harpoon IPA. Pretty good!

18:07.050 --> 18:08.120
(Sniffles)

18:08.150 --> 18:12.417
And I got to feel
the sun on my face.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.487
I can touch things!

18:14.520 --> 18:16.614
Josh, I'm holding your hand.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.856
(Sniffles)

18:21.330 --> 18:23.367
So it was worth it.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.665
- But this is not
your deathbed.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.631
- Uh... I'm dying,

18:31.670 --> 18:34.378
and I'm in my bed, so...

18:34.410 --> 18:35.969
- You're not dying, not really.

18:36.010 --> 18:37.978
- Hmm...
- No, not really, no.

18:38.010 --> 18:39.444
- Like, I'm
definitely dying.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.869
- You're losing this body.
- Well, it's my body.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.479
- And you are becoming

18:43.520 --> 18:48.117
the same Sally that we fell
in love with all over again.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.753
(Chuckles)

18:51.360 --> 18:55.228
What does it feel like when
your heart stops beating?

18:57.030 --> 18:58.828
- It's scary at first.

19:00.170 --> 19:04.732
Because you're losing control
of something that once felt...

19:04.770 --> 19:06.408
so fundamental.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.138
But then it gets quiet...

19:11.380 --> 19:12.609
and peaceful.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.618
(Sally breathing shakily)

19:15.580 --> 19:19.881
And you just give into it.
It's like falling asleep.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.684
And you know...

19:25.590 --> 19:28.093
that everything's
gonna be OK.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.832
- I do feel sleepy.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.736
- Close your eyes.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.332
We'll see you
in a few minutes.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.771
- I really did have
a blast with you guys.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.847
You know that?

19:52.090 --> 19:54.912
(Sniffling, breathing heavily)

20:00.300 --> 20:01.893
(Sighing loudly)

20:34.600 --> 20:36.329
(Exhales sharply)

20:40.130 --> 20:42.132
(Sighs)

20:42.170 --> 20:45.060
- Did it work?
Is she here?

20:46.840 --> 20:50.037
- Yeah, Josh.
She's right here.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.311
- I really think we made the
right choice with the dress.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.772
- How do you feel?

20:57.420 --> 21:01.050
- Weirdly, like...
I'm me again.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.854
(Aidan and Nora laughing)

21:02.890 --> 21:05.154
- Seems like a fairly
important conversation

21:05.190 --> 21:07.181
that I'm completely
unable to follow.

21:07.230 --> 21:10.894
- We need to go through
Donna's door with something.

21:10.930 --> 21:12.659
We need to arm
ourselves.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.998
- Um, I'm feeling like
any semblance of a grip

21:15.040 --> 21:16.599
might have gone
the way of my corpse.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.837
- Traditional weapons ain't
gonna do it, sweetheart.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.679
We-- You might
wanna look away.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.405
- Uh, I'm just
gonna remind you:

21:23.450 --> 21:26.875
until very recently, I had a
part-time job as an undertaker.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.344
I don't think there's any...

21:28.380 --> 21:29.450
(All screaming)

21:29.480 --> 21:31.414
Did you just gouge
a hole in my corpse?

21:31.450 --> 21:32.747
- The only chance we have

21:32.790 --> 21:34.610
is if we can reverse
the bewitchment.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.014
- We're nurses, OK?

21:36.060 --> 21:38.085
We're not too well-versed
on, like, eye of newt!

21:38.130 --> 21:40.895
Can't we just bring a weapon,
like a normal weapon?

21:40.930 --> 21:42.625
- Look, the heart
of the bewitched!

21:42.660 --> 21:43.798
- (Nora): God!

21:43.830 --> 21:45.229
- Sally's heart
is our weapon!

21:45.270 --> 21:47.693
- Dorothy only needed
a bucket of water. What are--

21:47.740 --> 21:51.040
- Trust me. Now you know that
incantation cold, yeah?

21:51.070 --> 21:52.162
- Carpe diem!

21:52.210 --> 21:53.678
- Then we'll
lead with that.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.429
Ilana's no match for Donna,
but it'll have to weaken her.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.040
When you see it's working,
that's when you come in.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.048
- OK, but I
steadfastly refuse

22:01.080 --> 22:03.048
to dive my hand into
Sally's chest cavity.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.946
- I'm going to need
a distraction.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.879
- What, like:
"Hey, witch, over here"?

22:06.920 --> 22:08.388
- That works.
- Sounds good?

22:08.420 --> 22:11.185
- What'll you do with the heart?
- Blood, hair, nails.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.959
Witches use them
because it contains

22:12.990 --> 22:14.196
the essence of a person,

22:14.230 --> 22:15.652
but they can break
spells as well.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.590
Part of Sally is a thing
we have that Donna never will.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.961
- I'm hearing you, but...

22:20.000 --> 22:22.935
why then didn't you just
use blood, hair or nails?

22:22.970 --> 22:24.199
- A heart is more powerful!

22:24.240 --> 22:25.833
- You should've led with that!

22:25.870 --> 22:28.032
I mean, how much
time do we have?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.169
- It's here.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.184
- It's here.

22:43.190 --> 22:45.158
- Keep the champagne
on ice, OK?

22:46.990 --> 22:49.027
- If I go through this door,

22:49.060 --> 22:51.961
I'm dead, dead,
like soul dead, for good!

22:52.000 --> 22:55.493
- Hey, define "dead".

22:57.070 --> 22:58.504
(Wind blowing)

22:59.770 --> 23:01.602
Hey, we gotta go.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.176
- I love you.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.639
(Gasps)

23:11.920 --> 23:13.979
- Please come back to me!

23:14.020 --> 23:15.488
Please!

23:20.360 --> 23:21.953
(Birds chirping)

23:26.100 --> 23:27.363
(Leaves rustling)

23:36.610 --> 23:37.748
(Boy): Papa!

23:37.780 --> 23:39.179
- Isaac!

23:54.500 --> 23:56.025
Isaac?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.664
(Birds cawing)

24:05.040 --> 24:06.405
(Sighs)

24:08.640 --> 24:09.778
Isaac!

24:09.810 --> 24:11.505
(Chuckles)

24:17.080 --> 24:19.139
(Snarling and barking)

24:21.360 --> 24:23.783
(Panting and screaming)

24:23.830 --> 24:24.922
(Growling)

24:24.960 --> 24:26.553
(Screams)

24:27.560 --> 24:29.198
(Whimpers)

24:29.230 --> 24:31.824
- Did you see something...
when we came through?

24:31.870 --> 24:33.497
- No.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.100
- Guys, anyone else remember
this place had gone tumbleweeds

24:36.140 --> 24:38.461
last time we tried
to pay Donna a visit?

24:38.510 --> 24:39.568
- Eh, witches...

24:39.610 --> 24:40.930
- I can also see you!

24:40.980 --> 24:43.301
So I guess that
in this dimension,

24:43.340 --> 24:45.570
the soup kitchen
is less goodwill

24:45.610 --> 24:47.874
through instant
mashed potatoes,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.410
and more... Thunderdome.

24:49.450 --> 24:52.613
(Ray): You shouldn't
have come here, Josh.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.828
- Yeah, I'm beginning
to sense that.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.425
You guys go. Let me
take care of this.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.792
- Josh, no.
- No, I mean it!

25:03.830 --> 25:06.492
If this is what karma's
dishing out for me,

25:06.530 --> 25:09.363
then I owe it
to myself to take it.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.404
- He's right. I got no beef
with either of you.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.831
Josh is the one who
put me in the ground.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.336
- He belongs to
Donna now, Josh.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.906
You could have no idea
what you're up against.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.145
- Come on.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.717
- I came here to
help Sally, you guys.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.115
Go find Donna.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.388
Go!

25:39.570 --> 25:41.868
- I figured you'd
bring the other one,

25:41.900 --> 25:43.163
hence the dog at the door.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.931
But a vampire too?

25:45.970 --> 25:50.009
You might wanna take a closer
look at that unsavoury circle.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.042
- Well, clearly,
she'd be better off

25:52.080 --> 25:55.277
palling around
with a necromancer.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.810
- I wasn't talking to you.

25:56.850 --> 25:59.285
- I think I have the right
to know now,

25:59.320 --> 26:01.812
what you have planned
for me, for my soul.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.454
- No, actually, you don't!

26:04.490 --> 26:08.120
You know, I thought
I might have some use for you.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.026
But this: your entourage,

26:10.060 --> 26:13.769
the yapping, the demands,
it's exhausting!

26:13.800 --> 26:17.168
So we are through.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.634
- Now!

26:18.670 --> 26:20.468
- Veneficus absum,
levare velum.

26:20.510 --> 26:23.673
Revelare verum faciem
pro totus vidi visum.

26:23.710 --> 26:24.541
(Chuckles)

26:24.580 --> 26:27.675
- Somebody memorized something!

26:27.720 --> 26:29.518
(Laughs wickedly)

26:30.380 --> 26:32.712
- We don't have
to do this, Ray.

26:32.750 --> 26:36.550
The witch, I know she has
some hold over you.

26:36.590 --> 26:38.922
But there's been enough
violence between us already.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.793
- I remember...
The woods...

26:44.170 --> 26:46.491
the fight,

26:46.530 --> 26:47.838
shots.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.989
You beat me to death.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.701
- What happened
that night...

26:53.340 --> 26:54.876
that's not the man
I wanna be.

26:54.910 --> 26:58.904
And I--I know I have
no right saying this...

26:59.950 --> 27:03.170
but I killed you because
I had no other choice!

27:03.220 --> 27:04.779
(Chuckles)

27:04.820 --> 27:08.120
- That's quite a mouthful,
isn't it, saying it out loud?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.219
Admitting that
you are a killer?

27:10.260 --> 27:12.388
- It's with me every day.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.094
I sent Val money,

27:16.130 --> 27:19.725
whatever I could,
for your son!

27:21.240 --> 27:25.302
I didn't want you
to end up here, like this.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.872
I'm sorry.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.852
- You don't stand a chance.

27:40.890 --> 27:43.313
(Both yelling)

27:45.860 --> 27:48.158
- Veneficus absum,
levare velum!

27:48.200 --> 27:51.625
Revelare verum faciem
pro totus vidi visum!

27:53.400 --> 27:54.834
- Good, keep going!

27:54.870 --> 27:56.292
- Veneficus absum,
levare velum!

27:56.340 --> 28:00.265
Revelare verum faciem
pro totus vidi visum!

28:00.310 --> 28:02.369
(Both yelling)

28:20.760 --> 28:22.250
(Panting)

28:23.060 --> 28:24.721
(Yelling)

28:28.300 --> 28:32.407
- Revelare verum faciem
pro totus vidi visum!

28:34.780 --> 28:36.805
Yeah!

28:36.840 --> 28:37.944
(Screams)

28:37.980 --> 28:40.005
- Is that all she taught you?

28:40.050 --> 28:42.018
Because this is getting old.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.882
(Gasps)

28:43.920 --> 28:45.285
- You were right, brother.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.858
The witch does have
some kind of hold on me.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.624
- Oh!

28:52.660 --> 28:53.923
(Snarling)

29:04.370 --> 29:06.304
- Ilana showed some promise.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.708
She was different...
and a real jealous bitch!

29:09.740 --> 29:12.448
Why else would
she have sent you here

29:12.480 --> 29:14.448
with a true face incantation?

29:14.480 --> 29:16.244
- "True face"...

29:16.280 --> 29:19.443
- "WVerum faciem"? You didn't
even know what you were saying!

29:19.490 --> 29:20.685
I went to college.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.449
- I'm betting
that was a few years

29:22.490 --> 29:25.050
before the advent
of beer pong, huh?

29:25.090 --> 29:26.421
- 17th century.
- Oh...

29:26.460 --> 29:28.349
- I probably got a
couple of years on you.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.459
- Salem, hmm?
- Andover.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.229
But Salem got
all the press.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.419
- This is about me.

29:33.470 --> 29:34.938
My friends bargained
for my life,

29:34.970 --> 29:37.837
so why don't you just
let Stevie and Nick go?

29:37.870 --> 29:38.860
(Scoffs and laughs)

29:38.910 --> 29:40.207
- She won't do it.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.402
And she can't. She exists
on the energy of souls.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.603
Without them, she would've been
dead hundreds of years ago.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.472
What she wants from you,
she wants to eat you, Sally!

29:48.520 --> 29:49.612
But you know what?

29:49.650 --> 29:51.687
Ha! That ain't
gonna happen.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.882
(Grunts)

29:53.920 --> 29:55.012
Oh!

29:55.060 --> 29:56.312
- Aidan!

29:57.390 --> 29:58.858
(Snarling)

29:59.660 --> 30:01.594
- So this is how it ends?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.762
Do you have any idea
how it felt...

30:09.340 --> 30:11.468
to despise the man
who made you?

30:13.370 --> 30:15.976
Our bond filled me
with shame.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.706
I'm sure your son
would understand.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.715
Maybe I'll... put him
out of his misery

30:25.750 --> 30:27.855
after I end his father!

30:32.160 --> 30:33.753
(Yells)

30:36.860 --> 30:38.726
(Panting)

30:42.870 --> 30:45.840
- What is it exactly that
you have against my friends?

30:45.870 --> 30:47.804
Did you have a
hard time fitting in

30:47.840 --> 30:49.376
at Colonial
Times Junior High?

30:49.410 --> 30:52.801
- Nick and Stevie are on you.
You had to renegotiate!

30:52.850 --> 30:54.614
And your fates
were always connected.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.709
- Oh, here we go again
with the renegotiation

30:56.750 --> 30:57.820
of my binding contract!

30:57.850 --> 30:59.944
Your deals
are bogus, Donna.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.687
They're all on your terms,
your secret, magical terms.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.154
And there's always a catch.

31:04.190 --> 31:06.557
- There's always a balance!

31:06.590 --> 31:07.921
(Snaps fingers)

31:08.760 --> 31:11.229
The three of you
could've lived

31:11.270 --> 31:12.419
long, happy lives.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.199
But no one can
resist seeking out

31:14.240 --> 31:15.560
the people from their past.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.761
It's human nature.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.939
And when their souls are
delivered to me,

31:18.970 --> 31:20.062
everybody's happy.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.707
And the terms changed.

31:22.740 --> 31:25.277
You just had to save
your brother.

31:25.310 --> 31:28.712
How did it feel the first time
you looked in the mirror

31:28.750 --> 31:30.411
and saw rotting flesh?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.488
Never mind.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.817
(Sighs)

31:35.860 --> 31:39.319
It's been days since
I took your friends.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.022
And as you can see,
I am starving.

31:42.060 --> 31:45.519
- I have come too far
for you to just take me.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.026
We're stronger than that.

31:47.070 --> 31:49.391
- You know, you're the first one
who ever fought back.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.999
I hope that's
a comfort to you.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.977
- I'm guessing she's also
the first who brought friends.

32:00.510 --> 32:02.148
(Sighs)

32:06.120 --> 32:08.760
- The blood of
the bewitched burns.

32:10.090 --> 32:13.788
The pain of the flames seeks
the source of the magic.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.564
I came through on
my end of our bargain.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.297
It's your turn, Sally.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.899
- Ah!
- No!

32:24.740 --> 32:27.107
- Stop! Sally, no!

32:27.140 --> 32:28.505
(Whimpering)

32:32.680 --> 32:34.011
- I love you.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.889
I love you.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.922
(Both yelling)

33:10.650 --> 33:12.914
(Inhales sharply)

33:12.950 --> 33:15.260
- You should be proud of her.

33:15.290 --> 33:16.689
Most of the souls I take

33:16.720 --> 33:18.358
have already lost
their will to exist.

33:18.390 --> 33:22.020
No one is strong enough to walk
the Earth like that forever,

33:22.060 --> 33:23.550
isolated, alone.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.159
- She was never alone.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.270
- No, maybe not.

33:26.300 --> 33:30.134
But still, some things...
are inevitable.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.036
(Rumbling)

33:35.080 --> 33:36.536
(Moaning)

33:41.380 --> 33:42.677
Aaah!

33:45.490 --> 33:46.946
(Panting)

33:50.090 --> 33:53.185
- What the hell was that?
What just happened?

33:53.230 --> 33:54.857
(Panting)

33:58.570 --> 33:59.799
- We won!

34:02.540 --> 34:03.962
- Is she here?

34:06.010 --> 34:07.239
- Yeah.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.101
(Birds chirping)

34:11.110 --> 34:12.271
- Well, there is--

34:12.310 --> 34:14.540
There is one little piece
of shiny silver lining

34:14.580 --> 34:16.014
to all this
supernatural carnage.

34:16.050 --> 34:18.280
- Other than our
continued survival?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.482
- This ghost is
dressed for success!

34:20.520 --> 34:21.817
(Laughs)

34:21.860 --> 34:24.830
- Talking about clothes again?
- Hmm-hmm.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.658
You should've seen
how long it took us

34:26.690 --> 34:29.022
to pick out
the bridesmaid's dress.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.322
(Laughing)

34:30.360 --> 34:33.295
- I'm sorry. This was
supposed to be our day.

34:33.330 --> 34:36.094
- The mood's a little off
though now, don't you think?

34:36.139 --> 34:41.010
What with all the burning
and... beheading?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.178
- So we'll wait.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.507
All right?

34:43.540 --> 34:45.304
Full moon's coming up.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.547
That way, I'll be able to see
this one at the ceremony, so...

34:48.580 --> 34:50.878
This one at the ceremony.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.786
There will be a wedding.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.150
I'm gonna marry you.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.282
(Chuckles)

34:56.320 --> 34:58.652
I promise, OK? You're not
getting out of it.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.694
- Is that really what
you're all wearing?

35:03.660 --> 35:05.196
- Em...

35:06.170 --> 35:08.969
What are you--
What are you doing here?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.593
- I thought about it a lot.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.665
And I am hurt and
I am scared, Josh.

35:12.710 --> 35:15.031
I mean, so far,
this new world of yours,

35:15.080 --> 35:16.809
I--I dunno if
I'm OK with it.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.070
But I do know that
I owe you a chance

35:19.110 --> 35:22.216
to help me understand
who you are, the real you.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.719
And besides,
your friends and...

35:24.750 --> 35:26.946
girlfriend, fiance,

35:26.990 --> 35:29.209
I like you all
a hell of a lot better

35:29.260 --> 35:31.228
than most of
the humans in my life.

35:34.630 --> 35:37.349
Hmm... You're all I got.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.765
So...

35:40.570 --> 35:41.867
We'll figure it out.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.210
You're getting married!
- Yeah.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.332
Yeah, not today, though.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.839
No, we're--we're
postponing the wedding.

35:47.870 --> 35:50.703
This day just kind of got
away from us a little bit.

35:50.740 --> 35:52.242
- What?
- Yeah, well--

35:52.280 --> 35:56.046
- I spent 45 minutes on the T
preparing that speech.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.514
I am wearing
a dress.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.439
- Yes, I can
see that, it's--

35:59.490 --> 36:00.446
(Clears throat)

36:00.490 --> 36:01.980
- There will be a wedding!

36:02.020 --> 36:04.990
Everybody inside now!

36:10.630 --> 36:12.223
(Exhaling sharply)

36:17.600 --> 36:18.931
(Breathing deeply)

36:18.970 --> 36:20.529
- Are you nervous?

36:21.580 --> 36:25.141
<i>- 1--1 Killed a zombie werewolf
in a magical dimension</i>

36:25.180 --> 36:26.147
a few hours ago.

36:26.180 --> 36:28.342
- Oh?
- So, yeah...

36:28.380 --> 36:32.715
So, um, pledging fidelity
to the love of my life

36:32.750 --> 36:35.356
seems kind of tame
by comparison.

36:35.390 --> 36:36.516
- Proud of you.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.516
(Laughs)

36:37.560 --> 36:38.789
No, no, I am.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.786
When we first met,

36:39.830 --> 36:41.423
I wasn't sure we'd get here.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.691
- To be fair, the ladies weren't
exactly swarming me back then.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.289
- Yeah, well,
you wouldn't let them.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.766
- Yeah, I sometimes
wonder where --

36:49.800 --> 36:54.010
If I hadn't let Nora in --
where she'd be.

36:55.110 --> 36:57.829
Maybe she'd be
married to some doctor.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.178
They'd spend
full moons stargazing

37:00.210 --> 37:03.441
on the roof of their
brownstone in Beacon Hill.

37:03.480 --> 37:08.042
- And she might have never known
what it feels like to be loved

37:08.090 --> 37:12.755
by a man who would literally
give his life for her happiness.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.460
This is what it's all about...

37:25.470 --> 37:27.302
our experiment.

37:28.510 --> 37:31.502
I mean, what's more human

37:31.550 --> 37:35.180
than a guy standing up
for his best friend

37:35.220 --> 37:37.314
on the day of his wedding?

37:37.350 --> 37:41.583
* Oh goodbye
* my lady in blue

37:41.620 --> 37:45.352
(Kat): I think we did
all right on 24 hours notice.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.085
(Girls laughing)

37:47.130 --> 37:48.450
- OK, now I'm nervous.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.060
(Kat): He's gonna die!
Well, not actually.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.626
(Nora): Got it.
(Kat): When he sees you...

37:53.670 --> 37:57.061
* So I'll think of you
* lady in white

37:57.100 --> 38:00.001
- Here, take these.
OK, go get him!

38:00.040 --> 38:02.532
* For blue is
*the colour of tears

38:02.580 --> 38:04.070
(Girls giggling)

38:04.110 --> 38:07.375
* An ocean of you
* wrapped in years

38:08.550 --> 38:11.941
* I know you'll get
* through tonight

38:13.150 --> 38:15.118
* If I think of you
* lady in white

38:15.160 --> 38:17.879
- All right,
let's get 'er done!

38:21.600 --> 38:24.160
Shouldn't you have
like a book or something?

38:25.130 --> 38:27.565
- Well, since
this is going to be

38:27.600 --> 38:31.503
what I will call
a non-traditional wedding...

38:31.540 --> 38:32.507
(All chuckling)

38:32.540 --> 38:34.372
Um, I just wanna say...

38:35.780 --> 38:38.442
well done, both of you.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.675
You found each other.

38:39.710 --> 38:42.213
(Sally): Please tell me
you wrote your own vows!

38:42.250 --> 38:43.775
There's nothing more romantic!

38:43.820 --> 38:45.948
- So we wrote our own VOWS.
- Yes!

38:45.990 --> 38:48.516
- We did?
Were we supposed to?

38:49.360 --> 38:52.660
- I--I did write my own vows.

38:52.690 --> 38:55.352
* T know I love you tonight

38:55.400 --> 38:57.323
Uh, Nora...

38:58.870 --> 39:01.293
I was the kind of guy
who thought

39:01.330 --> 39:04.368
_ that life was
just a series of choices.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.630
And if you kept making
the right choice

39:07.670 --> 39:09.672
over and over and over again,

39:09.710 --> 39:12.873
that it will all add up
to something safe...

39:12.910 --> 39:14.378
and constant...

39:15.180 --> 39:16.909
a reasonable facsimile

39:16.950 --> 39:19.282
of what you thought
you wanted,

39:19.320 --> 39:22.483
for yourself, for your future.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.325
But things get derailed.

39:26.360 --> 39:31.469
Stuff happens and you
don't always get a choice.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.465
And, uh, for a long time,

39:34.500 --> 39:37.231
I thought that was
really unfair.

39:38.540 --> 39:42.374
Because I had big,
big important plans.

39:42.410 --> 39:43.502
(Chuckles)

39:46.450 --> 39:48.077
(Exhales sharply)

39:48.980 --> 39:51.688
But I never
would've met you.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.949
So I'm thankful

39:52.990 --> 39:55.812
that I was a
complete blockhead.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.954
Because, as it turns out,

39:57.990 --> 40:01.051
life is just a series
of accidents.

40:02.230 --> 40:06.394
And one of those
accidents led me here...

40:07.600 --> 40:08.999
to you.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.566
"Cause you are just
SO, SO awesome.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.601
(Laughs)

40:14.740 --> 40:16.037
So thank you...

40:16.080 --> 40:17.570
(Clears throat)

40:17.610 --> 40:19.169
...for choosing me.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.713
Thanks you for choosing me!

40:21.750 --> 40:22.717
(Laughs)

40:22.750 --> 40:24.047
- I kissed him too soon!

40:24.080 --> 40:26.048
(All laughing)

40:26.090 --> 40:29.116
I didn't write any vows!
- That's all right.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.719
- Oh God, I love you!

40:30.760 --> 40:32.285
- That'll do!

40:32.330 --> 40:36.722
* If we sing for
* our ladies in white

40:36.760 --> 40:42.062
* If we sing
* for our ladies in white

40:43.700 --> 40:48.240
* Could we sing
* for our ladies in white

40:53.510 --> 40:54.477
- Ah!

40:54.520 --> 40:55.476
(Chuckles)

40:55.520 --> 40:57.375
One for the road!

41:00.320 --> 41:03.483
Monsters! They never
consider fire safety!

41:08.360 --> 41:09.953
(Giggles)

41:19.810 --> 41:20.766
(Door opening)

41:20.810 --> 41:21.971
(Kat): I'm starving.

41:22.010 --> 41:23.830
(Aidan): T'll make
you something.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.302
- Since when do you cook?

41:25.350 --> 41:26.943
- Wha-- Of course I cook!

41:26.980 --> 41:28.175
(Giggles)

41:28.210 --> 41:31.840
Ramen and tuna, PB and J.
(Kat): Yum!

41:31.890 --> 41:33.517
- Whatever you want.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.530
(Insects and birds chirping)

41:47.570 --> 41:51.097
(Woman singing)

41:51.910 --> 41:53.469
(Josh moaning)

41:59.110 --> 42:01.044
- Fire's low.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.547
- I'll get the firewood.
- No, no.

42:06.590 --> 42:08.342
You stay. I'll go.

42:10.190 --> 42:12.955
I'm not settling into
traditional gender roles

42:12.990 --> 42:14.754
on day one of my marriage.

42:22.740 --> 42:27.268
* "What do you have
* to lose?" you say

42:27.310 --> 42:32.146
* Everything, everything

42:32.180 --> 42:34.399
(Liam): Hello, Nora.

42:34.450 --> 42:37.442
My best wishes to the bride.
