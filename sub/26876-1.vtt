01:34.976 --> 01:37.876
You'll be glad to be
rid of him, I expect.

01:37.878 --> 01:40.679
We'd be more than happy
to keep him here in custody.

01:40.681 --> 01:42.715
Six months are enough.

01:42.717 --> 01:45.985
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.420
President Picquery.

01:47.422 --> 01:48.953
Mr. Spielman, sir.

01:48.955 --> 01:52.593
Prisoner is secured
and ready to travel.

01:57.732 --> 01:59.899
You've thrown
everything at him, I see.

01:59.901 --> 02:03.969
It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

02:03.971 --> 02:06.138
We've had to change
his guard three times.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.008
He's very persuasive.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.877
So we removed his tongue.

02:16.250 --> 02:21.087
Grindelwald!
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

02:23.858 --> 02:27.496
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

02:37.104 --> 02:39.071
The wizarding
community worldwide

02:39.073 --> 02:41.239
owes you a great debt,
Madam President.

02:41.241 --> 02:43.244
Do not underestimate him.

02:46.246 --> 02:50.918
Mr. Spielman,
we found his wand hidden away.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.922
Abernathy.

02:56.323 --> 02:58.559
And we found this.

03:10.805 --> 03:12.307
Hiyah!

03:49.777 --> 03:52.614
No more silver tongue. Hmm?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.083
You have joined
a noble cause, my friend.

06:19.126 --> 06:23.396
I know. I know.
I know, Antonio.

06:29.337 --> 06:30.739
So needy.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.102
They're ready for you, Newt.

08:44.272 --> 08:45.406
Leta.

08:47.641 --> 08:49.174
What are you doing here?

08:49.176 --> 08:50.708
Theseus thought
it would be good

08:50.710 --> 08:53.344
if I became part of
the Ministry family.

08:53.346 --> 08:56.381
Did he actually say the words
"Ministry family"?

08:56.383 --> 08:58.782
That sounds like my brother.

09:15.735 --> 09:18.438
Theseus was disappointed
you couldn't come to dinner.

09:19.373 --> 09:21.940
Any of the nights
we've asked you.

09:21.942 --> 09:23.375
Well, I've been busy.

09:23.377 --> 09:24.977
He's your brother, Newt.

09:24.979 --> 09:27.014
He likes spending time
with you.

09:27.715 --> 09:29.350
And so do I.

09:34.321 --> 09:38.357
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

09:38.359 --> 09:40.559
Why do strange creatures
love you so much?

09:40.561 --> 09:42.694
Well, there are
no strange creatures.

09:42.696 --> 09:44.364
Only blinkered people.

09:47.968 --> 09:49.568
How long did you
get in detention

09:49.570 --> 09:51.603
for saying that
to Prendergast?

09:51.605 --> 09:53.905
I think it was
a month that time.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.473
And I set off a dungbomb
under his desk

09:55.475 --> 09:57.277
so I could join you.
Do you remember?

10:02.783 --> 10:04.016
Um...

10:04.018 --> 10:05.987
No, I actually
don't remember that.

10:06.586 --> 10:08.053
Hello.

10:08.055 --> 10:11.756
Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner.

10:11.758 --> 10:14.193
Really? Well...

10:14.195 --> 10:16.094
Look, before we go
in there, I...

10:16.096 --> 10:17.896
It's my fifth attempt,
Theseus. I know the form.

10:17.898 --> 10:20.732
This isn't gonna be like
the other times. This is...

10:20.734 --> 10:24.803
Just try and keep
an open mind. Will you?

10:24.805 --> 10:26.038
And maybe a little less...

10:26.040 --> 10:27.408
Like me.

10:28.808 --> 10:30.642
Well, it can't hurt.

10:30.644 --> 10:32.479
Come on, let's go.

10:39.086 --> 10:41.453
<i>Hearing commences.</i>

10:41.455 --> 10:45.790
You want an end to the ban on
you traveling internationally.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.226
Why?

10:47.228 --> 10:49.126
Because I'd like to
travel internationally.

10:49.128 --> 10:52.497
Subject uncooperative
and evasive

10:52.499 --> 10:54.732
on reasons for
last international trip.

10:54.734 --> 10:56.568
It was a field trip, sir.

10:56.570 --> 10:59.872
I was just collecting material
for my book on magical beasts.

10:59.874 --> 11:01.372
You destroyed
half of New York.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.275
No, that's actually factually
incorrect on two counts.

11:03.277 --> 11:04.479
Newt.

11:06.412 --> 11:09.615
Mr. Scamander, it's clear
you're frustrated,

11:09.617 --> 11:12.620
and, frankly, so are we.

11:14.489 --> 11:16.188
In the spirit of compromise,

11:16.190 --> 11:18.256
we'd like to
make a proposition.

11:18.258 --> 11:20.157
What kind of proposition?

11:20.159 --> 11:21.559
The committee
will agree to lift

11:21.561 --> 11:24.195
your travel ban
under one condition.

11:24.197 --> 11:26.631
You join the Ministry.

11:26.633 --> 11:29.637
Specifically,
your brother's department.

11:32.873 --> 11:34.075
No.

11:36.009 --> 11:37.442
I think that

11:37.444 --> 11:39.745
Theseus is the Auror.

11:39.747 --> 11:41.713
I think my talents
lie elsewhere.

11:41.715 --> 11:42.780
Mr. Scamander,

11:42.782 --> 11:44.516
the wizarding
and non-wizarding worlds

11:44.518 --> 11:47.352
have been at peace
for over a century.

11:47.354 --> 11:50.155
Grindelwald wants to see
that peace destroyed.

11:50.157 --> 11:53.058
And for certain members
of our community,

11:53.060 --> 11:56.795
his message is very seductive.

11:56.797 --> 12:00.931
Many purebloods believe it is
their birthright to rule

12:00.933 --> 12:06.137
not only our world but
the non-magic world as well.

12:06.139 --> 12:08.338
They see Grindelwald
as their hero,

12:08.340 --> 12:11.209
and Grindelwald sees this

12:11.211 --> 12:14.715
boy as a means to
make this all come true.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.382
I'm sorry.
You're talking about Credence

12:18.384 --> 12:19.821
as if he were still here.

12:20.988 --> 12:22.790
He survived, Newt.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.925
He's still alive.

12:26.927 --> 12:28.926
He left New York months ago.

12:28.928 --> 12:30.195
He's somewhere in Europe.

12:30.197 --> 12:31.663
Where exactly,
we don't know, but...

12:31.665 --> 12:34.102
You want me to
hunt Credence down?

12:35.635 --> 12:36.934
To kill him?

12:36.936 --> 12:39.340
Same old Scamander.

12:41.774 --> 12:43.041
What is he doing here?

12:43.043 --> 12:46.713
I'm taking on the job that
you're too soft to do.

12:50.084 --> 12:51.786
Is that it?

12:55.755 --> 12:58.658
Travel documentation denied.

13:00.827 --> 13:01.862
Newt!

13:03.364 --> 13:04.896
You think I like
the idea of Grimmson

13:04.898 --> 13:06.430
- any more than you do?
- Listen, I don't want to hear

13:06.432 --> 13:08.032
how the ends
justify the means, Theseus.

13:08.034 --> 13:09.868
I think you're gonna have to
pull your head out the sand!

13:09.870 --> 13:11.536
Okay, right, here we go. What
a selfish, irresponsible...

13:11.538 --> 13:14.539
You know, the time is coming

13:14.541 --> 13:17.575
when everyone, everyone is
gonna have to pick a side.

13:17.577 --> 13:18.812
Even you.

13:19.412 --> 13:21.382
I don't do sides.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.888
Newt. Newt.

13:33.225 --> 13:34.695
Come here.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.537
They're watching you.

13:54.916 --> 13:56.417
<i>Well, gentlemen,</i>

13:57.484 --> 14:00.620
I assume this means
I have the job.

15:21.768 --> 15:24.839
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

15:26.806 --> 15:29.473
I want you to
go to the circus now.

15:29.475 --> 15:31.910
Give my note to Credence.

15:31.912 --> 15:33.511
Begin his journey.

15:33.513 --> 15:37.248
When we've won, they'll
flee cities in the millions.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.650
They've had their time.

15:38.652 --> 15:41.319
We don't say
such things out loud.

15:41.321 --> 15:43.487
We want only freedom.

15:43.489 --> 15:45.689
Freedom to be ourselves.

15:45.691 --> 15:48.092
To annihilate non-wizards.

15:48.094 --> 15:50.628
Not all of them. Not all.

15:50.630 --> 15:53.598
We're not merciless.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.434
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

17:05.003 --> 17:06.069
<i>Ventus.</i>

17:48.982 --> 17:50.451
Dumbledore.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.985
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

17:54.987 --> 17:56.421
Hmm.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.893
I do enjoy a view.

18:00.359 --> 18:01.561
<i>Nebulus.</i>

18:07.100 --> 18:08.567
How was it?

18:08.569 --> 18:10.868
They're still convinced
that you sent me to New York.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.639
You told them I didn't?

18:13.039 --> 18:14.172
Yes.

18:14.174 --> 18:15.406
Evening.

18:15.408 --> 18:16.877
Even though you did.

18:18.844 --> 18:21.547
You told me where to find that
trafficked Thunderbird, Dumbledore.

18:21.549 --> 18:23.147
You knew that
I would take him home,

18:23.149 --> 18:24.982
and you knew I'd have to take
him through a Muggle port.

18:24.984 --> 18:27.752
I've always felt an affinity
with the great magical birds.

18:27.754 --> 18:29.588
There's a story in my family

18:29.590 --> 18:31.123
that a phoenix will come to

18:31.125 --> 18:33.491
any Dumbledore
in desperate need.

18:33.493 --> 18:37.028
They say
my great-grandfather had one.

18:37.030 --> 18:40.499
And that it took flight when
he died, never to return.

18:40.501 --> 18:41.666
With all due respect,
Professor,

18:41.668 --> 18:43.068
I don't believe for a minute

18:43.070 --> 18:45.138
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.346
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

18:55.348 --> 18:58.183
Trying to trace
his real family.

18:58.185 --> 19:02.820
I take it you've heard the
rumors about who he really is.

19:02.822 --> 19:03.823
No.

19:11.098 --> 19:12.696
The purebloods think

19:12.698 --> 19:15.568
he's the last of
an important French line.

19:17.603 --> 19:20.338
A baby whom
everyone thought lost.

19:20.340 --> 19:21.540
Not Leta's brother?

19:21.542 --> 19:23.508
That's what
they're whispering.

19:23.510 --> 19:27.044
And pureblood or not,
I know this.

19:27.046 --> 19:29.981
An Obscurus grows
in the absence of love

19:29.983 --> 19:32.517
as a dark twin,
an only friend.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.952
If Credence has
a real brother or sister

19:34.954 --> 19:36.921
out there
that can take its place,

19:36.923 --> 19:39.523
he might yet be saved.

19:39.525 --> 19:42.393
Wherever Credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger

19:42.395 --> 19:44.561
or a danger to others.

19:44.563 --> 19:49.166
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

19:49.168 --> 19:52.305
And I rather hope you might
be the one to find him.

19:57.543 --> 19:59.211
What's that?

19:59.213 --> 20:03.947
An address of a very old
acquaintance of mine.

20:03.949 --> 20:07.417
A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.

20:07.419 --> 20:09.820
Safe house? Why would
I need a safe house in Paris?

20:09.822 --> 20:11.589
One hopes you won't,
but should things

20:11.591 --> 20:13.625
at some point
go terribly wrong,

20:13.627 --> 20:15.527
it's good to
have a place to go.

20:15.529 --> 20:17.828
You know, for a cup of tea.

20:17.830 --> 20:19.096
No. No, no, no.

20:19.098 --> 20:21.165
Absolutely not.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.367
No, no, 'cause I'm banned from
international travel, Dumbledore.

20:23.369 --> 20:25.069
If I leave the country,
they will put me in Azkaban,

20:25.071 --> 20:26.637
and they will
throw away the key.

20:26.639 --> 20:28.106
Do you know why
I admire you, Newt?

20:28.108 --> 20:29.874
What?

20:29.876 --> 20:32.279
More, perhaps,
than any man I know.

20:34.313 --> 20:36.617
You do not seek power.

20:37.283 --> 20:39.017
Or popularity.

20:39.019 --> 20:43.958
You simply ask,
is a thing right in itself.

20:45.324 --> 20:48.192
If it is, you do it
no matter the cost.

20:48.194 --> 20:49.860
That's all very well,
Dumbledore,

20:49.862 --> 20:52.332
but forgive me for asking.
Why can't you go?

20:58.038 --> 21:00.240
I cannot move
against Grindelwald.

21:03.676 --> 21:05.212
It has to be you.

21:11.717 --> 21:13.283
Well, I can't blame you.

21:13.285 --> 21:16.087
In your shoes,
I'd probably refuse too.

21:16.089 --> 21:17.454
- What?
- It's late.

21:17.456 --> 21:18.589
Good evening, Newt.

21:18.591 --> 21:19.792
Wait, no.

21:20.828 --> 21:22.363
Oh, come on.

21:36.775 --> 21:38.177
Dumbledore.

22:43.444 --> 22:44.945
Bunty!

22:47.180 --> 22:48.181
Bunty!

22:51.150 --> 22:54.653
Bunty. Bunty, the baby
Nifflers are loose again.

23:06.532 --> 23:07.865
Well done.

23:07.867 --> 23:09.334
I'm so sorry, Newt.

23:09.336 --> 23:10.667
They must've picked the lock
while I was cleaning out

23:10.669 --> 23:11.504
- the Augureys.
- Not to worry.

23:18.477 --> 23:19.944
I fed nearly everyone.

23:19.946 --> 23:21.479
Pinky's had
his nose drops and...

23:21.481 --> 23:22.780
And Elsie?

23:22.782 --> 23:24.447
Elsie's droppings
are nearly normal again.

23:24.449 --> 23:26.184
Wonderful.

23:26.186 --> 23:29.322
You can, um...
You can clock off now.

23:31.957 --> 23:33.657
I told you to
leave the Kelpie to me.

23:33.659 --> 23:34.925
That wound
needs more ointment.

23:34.927 --> 23:36.796
I don't want you
losing fingers over it.

23:46.305 --> 23:49.275
Seriously,
you go home now, Bunty.

23:50.576 --> 23:51.876
You must be exhausted.

23:51.878 --> 23:54.346
You know the Kelpie's
easier with two.

23:58.885 --> 24:00.921
Perhaps you should
take off your shirt.

24:02.888 --> 24:04.856
Don't worry.

24:04.858 --> 24:06.691
I'll dry off quick enough.

24:47.966 --> 24:50.367
Someone needed to
let off some steam.

24:50.369 --> 24:51.905
Ointment, Bunty.

24:58.512 --> 25:01.745
You bite Bunty again, and
there'll be trouble, mister.

25:04.050 --> 25:05.849
What was that?

25:05.851 --> 25:07.253
I don't know.

25:09.355 --> 25:11.321
But I want you to
go home now, Bunty.

25:11.323 --> 25:12.889
- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No.

25:12.891 --> 25:14.961
I want you to go home. Please.

25:23.403 --> 25:24.935
Just give me
the pieces.

25:24.937 --> 25:26.337
- I got it.
- Honey, if you could

25:26.339 --> 25:28.772
- just give it to me...
- He doesn't care.

25:28.774 --> 25:31.110
If you could just give this
to me, sweetheart.

25:36.148 --> 25:38.950
Hey!

25:38.952 --> 25:42.186
Newt! Get over here,
you maniac.

25:42.188 --> 25:44.489
We hope you don't mind, Newt.

25:44.491 --> 25:45.589
We let ourselves in.

25:45.591 --> 25:48.693
It's rainin' out there,
cats and dogs.

25:48.695 --> 25:50.060
London's cold.

25:50.062 --> 25:51.663
You were supposed to
have been Obliviated.

25:51.665 --> 25:53.498
I know.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.165
It didn't work, pal.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.367
I mean, you said it.

25:56.369 --> 25:58.603
The potion
only erases bad memories.

25:58.605 --> 25:59.904
I didn't have any.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.938
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I had some weird ones,

26:01.940 --> 26:03.808
and I had some scary ones.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.675
But this angel...

26:05.677 --> 26:07.244
This angel over here,

26:07.246 --> 26:10.213
she filled me in on
all the bad parts,

26:10.215 --> 26:12.282
and here we are, I guess, huh?

26:12.284 --> 26:14.687
This is wonderful.

26:17.157 --> 26:18.658
Wait. Is...

26:20.025 --> 26:23.029
Tina? Tina?

26:25.130 --> 26:27.234
Oh, it's just us, honey.

26:28.201 --> 26:29.934
Me and Jacob.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.336
Oh.

26:31.338 --> 26:33.137
Why don't I
make us some dinner, huh?

26:33.139 --> 26:34.805
Yes!

26:39.413 --> 26:40.344
Hey, honey.

26:40.346 --> 26:43.079
Teen and I aren't talking.

26:43.081 --> 26:46.184
- Why?
- Oh, well, you know...

26:46.186 --> 26:47.719
She found out about
Jacob and I seeing each other,

26:47.721 --> 26:50.887
and she didn't like it,
'cause of the law.

26:50.889 --> 26:52.790
Not allowed to... Oop!

26:52.792 --> 26:54.492
Not allowed to date No-Majs,

26:54.494 --> 26:58.296
not allowed to marry them.
Blah, blah, blah.

26:58.298 --> 27:02.433
Well, she was all in
a tizzy anyway 'cause of you.

27:02.435 --> 27:03.534
Me?

27:03.536 --> 27:04.969
Yeah, you, Newt.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.071
It was in <i>Spellbound.</i>

27:07.073 --> 27:09.408
Here. I brought it for you.

27:13.245 --> 27:17.147
"Newt Scamander with fiancee
Leta Lestrange,

27:17.149 --> 27:18.749
"brother Theseus
and unknown woman."

27:18.751 --> 27:20.184
Relax.

27:20.186 --> 27:22.755
No. So Theseus is
marrying Leta, not me.

27:23.388 --> 27:24.523
Oh!

27:25.824 --> 27:28.094
Oh... Oh, dear.

27:29.428 --> 27:30.496
Well...

27:31.263 --> 27:34.132
See, Teen read that,

27:34.134 --> 27:37.135
and she started
dating someone else.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.303
He's an Auror.
His name's Achilles Tolliver.

27:39.305 --> 27:41.107
Tolliver.

27:47.147 --> 27:48.646
Anyway...

27:48.648 --> 27:51.715
We are real excited to
be here, Newt. This is a...

27:51.717 --> 27:53.519
Well,
it's a special trip for us.

27:54.285 --> 27:57.056
You see, Jacob and I,

27:57.923 --> 27:59.459
we're getting married.

28:02.628 --> 28:04.263
I'm marrying Jacob.

28:05.865 --> 28:07.467
Ah!

28:09.168 --> 28:11.534
Oh.

28:11.536 --> 28:14.173
<i>You've enchanted him,
haven't you?</i>

28:15.007 --> 28:17.242
What?

28:17.244 --> 28:19.143
I have not.

28:19.145 --> 28:20.778
Will you stop reading my mind?

28:20.780 --> 28:23.280
<i>Queenie, you've brought him
here against his will.</i>

28:23.282 --> 28:26.651
Oh, that is an outrageous
accusation. Look at him.

28:26.653 --> 28:29.988
He's just happy.
He's so happy.

28:29.990 --> 28:31.525
Then you won't mind
if I, um...

28:33.892 --> 28:35.225
Please don't.

28:35.227 --> 28:36.961
Queenie,
you've got nothing to fear

28:36.963 --> 28:38.930
if he wants to get married. We
can just lift the enchantment

28:38.932 --> 28:40.534
and he can tell us himself.

28:50.577 --> 28:52.342
What do you got there?

28:52.344 --> 28:53.711
Whatchu gonna do?

28:53.713 --> 28:55.549
Whatchu gonna do with that,
Mr. Scamander?

28:56.048 --> 28:57.181
<i>Surgito.</i>

29:08.261 --> 29:10.161
Congratulations
on your engagement, Jacob.

29:10.163 --> 29:12.165
Wait, what?

29:15.734 --> 29:17.670
Oh, no. You didn't.

29:20.505 --> 29:21.739
Queenie!

29:21.741 --> 29:23.143
One second.

29:23.842 --> 29:25.943
Queenie!

29:25.945 --> 29:27.578
It's very nice to see you.

29:27.580 --> 29:28.913
Where the hell am I right now?

29:28.915 --> 29:30.213
London.

29:30.215 --> 29:31.515
Oh!

29:31.517 --> 29:33.352
I always wanted to go here!

29:33.886 --> 29:35.122
Queenie!

29:38.890 --> 29:40.791
Oh, Queenie, honey.

29:40.793 --> 29:42.793
Well, I'm curious when
you were gonna wake me up.

29:42.795 --> 29:44.430
After we had five kids?

29:47.465 --> 29:49.599
Why is it wrong to
wanna marry you?

29:49.601 --> 29:52.904
- Okay.
- To wanna have a family?

29:52.906 --> 29:55.675
I just want what everyone else
has, that's all.

29:57.944 --> 29:59.610
Wait, wait.

29:59.612 --> 30:01.678
We've talked about this,
like, a million times.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.313
If we get married
and they find out,

30:03.315 --> 30:04.816
they're gonna throw you
in jail, sweetheart.

30:04.818 --> 30:07.217
I can't have that.

30:07.219 --> 30:10.253
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

30:10.255 --> 30:13.557
I ain't a wizard.
I'm just me.

30:13.559 --> 30:15.326
They're really
progressive here,

30:15.328 --> 30:17.462
and they'll let us
get married properly.

30:17.464 --> 30:20.200
Sweetheart,
you don't need to enchant me.

30:20.899 --> 30:22.569
I'm already enchanted.

30:23.468 --> 30:25.336
I love you so much.

30:25.338 --> 30:28.039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:28.041 --> 30:31.009
But I can't have you risking
everything like this, you know?

30:31.011 --> 30:33.480
You're not giving us
a choice, sweetheart.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.915
You're not giving me a choice.

30:37.917 --> 30:40.887
One of us had to be brave,
and you were being a coward.

30:43.321 --> 30:45.623
I was being a coward?

30:45.625 --> 30:46.960
If I'm a coward, you're...

30:49.728 --> 30:50.729
Crazy.

30:52.098 --> 30:53.463
I didn't say it.

30:53.465 --> 30:54.798
You didn't have to.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.469
No, I didn't mean it,
sweetheart.

30:57.704 --> 30:58.905
Yeah, you did.

30:59.972 --> 31:01.172
No.

31:01.174 --> 31:03.540
I'm gonna go see my sister.

31:03.542 --> 31:05.009
Fine. See your sister.

31:05.011 --> 31:07.078
- Fine.
- No, wait! Wait!

31:07.080 --> 31:09.215
No! Queenie!

31:11.050 --> 31:12.719
I didn't mean it.

31:14.954 --> 31:17.355
I didn't say nothin'.

31:30.203 --> 31:31.838
<i>Papyrus Reparo.</i>

31:42.048 --> 31:45.284
<i>My dear Queenie,
What a beautiful city.</i>

31:46.349 --> 31:47.887
<i>I'm thinking of you.
Tina.</i>

31:54.193 --> 31:55.759
Hey, Newt!

31:55.761 --> 31:59.262
Down here, Jacob. So I'll be
with you in a second.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.870
I got my own problems.

32:29.628 --> 32:31.561
Queenie left a postcard.

32:31.563 --> 32:33.697
Tina's in Paris
looking for Credence.

32:33.699 --> 32:34.765
Genius.

32:34.767 --> 32:36.767
Queenie's gonna go
straight for Tina.

32:36.769 --> 32:38.601
Okay, we're going
to France, pal.

32:38.603 --> 32:40.806
- Hold on. I'll get my jacket.
- I've got it.

32:42.942 --> 32:43.943
Oh.

32:49.482 --> 32:50.684
Beautiful.

34:09.895 --> 34:11.163
Nagini.

34:16.902 --> 34:18.103
Credence.

34:21.206 --> 34:23.643
I think I know where she is.

34:29.382 --> 34:31.114
We escape tonight.

34:31.116 --> 34:32.118
Hey.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.891
I've told you to
stay away from her, boy.

34:40.893 --> 34:42.896
Did I say
you could take a break?

34:44.096 --> 34:45.165
Clean out the Kappa.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.002
And you, get ready.

35:01.514 --> 35:06.183
Next, in our little show
of freaks and oddities,

35:06.185 --> 35:08.518
I present to you

35:08.520 --> 35:11.121
a Maledictus.

35:13.958 --> 35:17.661
Once trapped
in the jungles of Indonesia,

35:17.663 --> 35:20.630
she is the carrier
of a blood curse.

35:20.632 --> 35:21.864
Ohh!

35:21.866 --> 35:24.969
Such Underbeings
are destined

35:24.971 --> 35:26.936
through the course
of their lives

35:26.938 --> 35:29.605
to turn permanently
into beasts.

35:29.607 --> 35:31.543
Ohh!

35:32.643 --> 35:34.112
But look at her.

35:34.746 --> 35:37.649
So beautiful. Yes.

35:39.118 --> 35:41.684
So desirable.

35:41.686 --> 35:44.454
But soon,
she will be trapped forever

35:44.456 --> 35:46.025
in a very different body.

35:47.426 --> 35:51.598
Every night when she sleeps,
<i>mesdames et messieurs,</i>

35:52.764 --> 35:56.069
she is forced to become...

36:03.007 --> 36:05.210
She is forced to become...

36:10.549 --> 36:13.416
She is forced to become...

36:22.293 --> 36:26.199
Over time, she will not
be able to transform back.

36:28.433 --> 36:32.772
She will be forever trapped
in the body of a snake.

37:06.239 --> 37:07.240
Credence!

37:16.815 --> 37:18.248
Pack it up.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.052
Paris is done for us now.

37:50.148 --> 37:52.317
The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?

37:56.054 --> 37:57.920
He's looking for his mother.

37:57.922 --> 38:00.392
All my freaks
think they can go home.

38:03.594 --> 38:04.997
Okay, let's go.

38:21.748 --> 38:23.713
Look, I think you and I
were at the circus

38:23.715 --> 38:25.849
for the same reason,
<i>Monsieur...</i>

38:25.851 --> 38:27.920
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

38:28.953 --> 38:30.520
And you think right.

38:30.522 --> 38:31.922
What do you want
with Credence?

38:31.924 --> 38:33.657
- The same as you.
- Which is?

38:33.659 --> 38:35.695
To prove
who the boy really is.

38:39.232 --> 38:41.264
If the rumors of his identity
are correct,

38:41.266 --> 38:45.438
he and I are,
distantly, related.

38:46.739 --> 38:48.773
I am the last male
of my pure-blooded line,

38:48.775 --> 38:51.244
and so, if the rumors
are correct, is he.

38:53.145 --> 38:57.746
Have you read <i>The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?</i>

38:57.748 --> 39:01.351
Yeah. But that's poetry,
not proof.

39:01.353 --> 39:02.688
Hmm.

39:04.322 --> 39:06.458
If I could show you
something better,

39:07.960 --> 39:12.061
more concrete, something
that proves who he is,

39:12.063 --> 39:15.134
would the Ministries of Europe
and America let him live?

39:16.735 --> 39:18.270
They might.

39:20.205 --> 39:21.373
Then come.

39:46.299 --> 39:47.300
So...

39:50.902 --> 39:52.971
Credence Barebone.

39:54.906 --> 39:58.942
Nearly destroyed by
the woman who raised him.

39:58.944 --> 40:01.880
Yet now he seeks
the mother who bore him.

40:02.681 --> 40:04.751
He's desperate for family.

40:05.516 --> 40:07.319
He's desperate for love.

40:08.688 --> 40:12.155
He's the key to our victory.

40:12.157 --> 40:14.127
Well, we know where
the boy is, don't we?

40:15.360 --> 40:16.960
Why don't we grab him
and leave?

40:16.962 --> 40:19.031
He must come to me freely,

40:19.598 --> 40:22.199
and he will.

40:22.201 --> 40:26.072
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

40:28.172 --> 40:31.175
The trail that
will lead him to me

40:31.177 --> 40:35.078
and the strange and
glorious truth of who he is.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.049
Why is he so important?

40:44.056 --> 40:49.558
Who represents the greatest
threat to our cause?

40:49.560 --> 40:51.527
Albus Dumbledore.

40:51.529 --> 40:53.364
If I asked you now

40:53.366 --> 40:57.668
to go to the school where he
is hiding and kill him for me,

40:57.670 --> 40:59.505
would you do it for me, Krall?

41:05.543 --> 41:08.281
Credence is
the only entity alive

41:09.848 --> 41:11.551
who can kill him.

41:13.219 --> 41:15.188
You really think
he can kill the Great...

41:17.822 --> 41:20.025
Can kill Albus Dumbledore?

41:20.659 --> 41:23.226
I know he can.

41:23.228 --> 41:27.400
But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?

41:30.536 --> 41:31.904
Will you?

41:43.982 --> 41:46.016
Jacob, that man
Tina's been seeing...

41:46.018 --> 41:47.583
Don't worry.
She's gonna see you

41:47.585 --> 41:49.686
and she'll see
the four of us together,

41:49.688 --> 41:51.487
it'll be just like New York all over again.
Don't worry about it.

41:51.489 --> 41:52.956
Yes, but he's
an Auror, Queenie said.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.056
Yeah, he's
an Auror. So what?

41:54.058 --> 41:55.360
Don't worry about him.

41:58.330 --> 42:01.400
What do you think I should
say to her if I see her?

42:02.668 --> 42:07.070
Oh, well, it's best
not to plan these things.

42:07.072 --> 42:08.538
You know, you just say

42:08.540 --> 42:10.442
whatever comes to you
in the moment.

42:14.513 --> 42:17.482
She has eyes
just like a salamander.

42:18.516 --> 42:19.652
Don't say that.

42:23.288 --> 42:26.556
Look, you just
tell her that you missed her.

42:26.558 --> 42:27.791
- Right.
- Right, and then

42:27.793 --> 42:31.360
you came all the way
to Paris just to find her.

42:31.362 --> 42:34.431
She'll love that. And then

42:34.433 --> 42:36.065
tell her you're losing
sleep at night

42:36.067 --> 42:39.268
for thinking of her and...

42:39.270 --> 42:41.505
Just don't say nothing about
no salamanders, all right?

42:41.507 --> 42:43.038
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.509
Hey. Hey, hey.

42:46.110 --> 42:47.811
It's gonna be all right.

42:47.813 --> 42:49.478
We're in this together, pal.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.982
Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you find Tina,

42:51.984 --> 42:53.884
find Queenie,

42:53.886 --> 42:56.387
and we'll all be happy again,
just like old times.

42:56.389 --> 42:57.423
Who is this guy?

42:59.257 --> 43:00.690
Oh, he's the only way

43:00.692 --> 43:02.491
I can leave the country
without documentation.

43:02.493 --> 43:05.529
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

43:05.531 --> 43:07.532
I don't do well
on boats, Newt.

43:08.165 --> 43:09.733
You'll be fine.

43:09.735 --> 43:11.938
Stir your
stumps. Leaves in one minute.

43:13.005 --> 43:14.204
50 Galleons.

43:14.206 --> 43:15.973
No, we said 30.

43:15.975 --> 43:17.440
Uh-huh. 30 to go to France.

43:17.442 --> 43:21.011
20 not to tell anyone
I seen Newt Scamander

43:21.013 --> 43:22.681
leaving the country illegally.

43:24.148 --> 43:25.951
Price of fame, pal.

43:30.723 --> 43:32.188
Mmm. 10 seconds.

43:32.190 --> 43:34.458
- Eight.
- Jacob.

43:34.460 --> 43:35.594
Seven.

43:36.795 --> 43:38.197
Six.

43:38.663 --> 43:39.965
Mmm...

43:40.900 --> 43:42.866
Four.

43:42.868 --> 43:45.103
Three. Two.

43:45.871 --> 43:47.306
One.

43:56.449 --> 43:58.581
I didn't like
that Portkey, Newt.

43:58.583 --> 44:00.550
So you keep saying.

44:00.552 --> 44:01.851
Follow me.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.858
<i>Confundus.</i>

44:14.665 --> 44:16.368
Come on. It'll wear off
in a few minutes.

44:28.013 --> 44:30.449
<i>Appare vestigium.</i>

44:35.721 --> 44:36.789
<i>Accio</i> Niffler.

44:37.922 --> 44:39.590
Get looking.

44:39.592 --> 44:41.227
Oi! Get looking.

44:44.628 --> 44:46.429
That's a Kappa.

44:46.431 --> 44:48.366
It's a Japanese water demon.

44:53.105 --> 44:54.572
Tina?

44:55.040 --> 44:56.242
Tina!

45:02.813 --> 45:04.649
What have you found?

45:08.286 --> 45:10.156
And we're licking
the dirt now.

45:24.101 --> 45:25.571
<i>Revelio.</i>

45:28.005 --> 45:29.574
Newt, what made those?

45:30.775 --> 45:32.544
That is a Zouwu.

45:34.779 --> 45:36.445
It's a Chinese creature.

45:36.447 --> 45:39.215
They are incredibly fast
and incredibly powerful.

45:39.217 --> 45:41.851
They can travel
1,000 miles in a day,

45:41.853 --> 45:43.453
and this one could take you

45:43.455 --> 45:45.954
from one part of Paris
to the next in a single leap.

45:49.226 --> 45:50.495
Oh, good boy.

45:52.029 --> 45:54.197
Jacob, she was here.

45:54.199 --> 45:55.697
Tina stood here.

45:55.699 --> 45:58.136
She has incredibly narrow
feet. Have you noticed?

46:00.071 --> 46:01.739
Can't say that I have.

46:05.509 --> 46:07.345
Then someone came towards her.

46:19.156 --> 46:20.625
<i>Avensegium.</i>

46:25.163 --> 46:26.797
- Right. Follow that feather.
- What?

46:26.799 --> 46:28.701
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

46:29.301 --> 46:31.735
Where is he? Ah!

46:31.737 --> 46:33.239
<i>Accio</i> Niffler.

46:40.179 --> 46:41.714
Drop the bucket.

47:21.618 --> 47:24.987
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you just said at all.

47:24.989 --> 47:27.523
Welcome to
the French Ministry of Magic.

47:27.525 --> 47:30.360
What is your business, please?

47:30.362 --> 47:34.163
I need to
speak to Tina Goldstein.

47:34.165 --> 47:39.638
She's an American Auror
working on a case here.

47:44.176 --> 47:46.710
We have
no Tina Goldstein here.

47:46.712 --> 47:49.545
No, I'm sorry. There must
be some sort of mistake.

47:49.547 --> 47:52.581
See, I know she's in Paris.
She sent me a postcard.

47:52.583 --> 47:54.585
I brought it.
I can show it to you. Here.

47:54.587 --> 47:56.186
Maybe you can help me
find it here.

47:56.188 --> 47:58.355
It's just in here.

47:58.357 --> 48:00.956
Rabbits! If you can
just wait one moment!

48:00.958 --> 48:03.793
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it.

48:03.795 --> 48:05.128
Where is it?

48:05.130 --> 48:06.529
One second.

48:06.531 --> 48:08.467
What did I do with you?

48:43.034 --> 48:44.967
Could we at least
stop for coffee or...

48:44.969 --> 48:46.101
Not now, Jacob.

48:46.103 --> 48:48.741
<i>Chocolat chaud</i> or...
Just for a second.

48:52.877 --> 48:54.643
- I don't know.
- This way. Come on.

48:54.645 --> 48:58.246
Pain au chocolat?
Half a croissant and a bonbon?

48:58.248 --> 48:59.618
This way.

49:04.656 --> 49:06.324
Jacob!

49:19.837 --> 49:21.103
Jacob?

51:03.641 --> 51:05.076
She's home.

51:52.458 --> 51:53.926
Are you Irma?

51:55.427 --> 51:57.629
Are you Irma Dugard?

51:58.862 --> 52:03.569
I'm sorry. Your name is
on my adoption paper.

52:05.268 --> 52:06.804
Does this make sense?

52:08.806 --> 52:11.543
You gave me to
Mrs. Barebone in New York.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.695
I am not your mother.

52:32.697 --> 52:34.633
I was only a servant.

52:38.402 --> 52:40.805
You were so beautiful a baby.

52:43.241 --> 52:45.510
And you are a beautiful man.

52:55.853 --> 52:58.820
I did not want
to leave you there.

52:58.822 --> 53:00.893
Why didn't they want me?

53:05.230 --> 53:08.465
Why is your name
on my adoption paper?

53:08.467 --> 53:11.670
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

53:13.038 --> 53:15.806
because she was supposed
to look after you.

55:22.868 --> 55:24.402
She's dead.

55:26.904 --> 55:29.107
How did the boy take it?

55:30.540 --> 55:32.076
He's sensitive.

55:33.578 --> 55:36.848
The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I missed.

55:37.915 --> 55:39.482
I know my reputation.

55:39.484 --> 55:42.018
Listen to me.
The disapproval of cowards

55:42.020 --> 55:43.822
is praise to the brave.

55:44.723 --> 55:47.424
Your name will be
written in glory

55:47.426 --> 55:50.826
when wizards rule the world.

55:50.828 --> 55:54.029
And the clock
is ticking faster.

55:54.031 --> 55:57.835
You watch over Credence.
Keep him safe.

55:58.768 --> 56:00.705
For the greater good.

56:01.906 --> 56:04.674
For the greater good.

56:06.511 --> 56:08.447
You know
what I miss about Queenie?

56:10.949 --> 56:12.417
Everything.

56:14.819 --> 56:17.552
I even miss the stuff
that drove me nuts.

56:17.554 --> 56:19.156
Like the mind reading.

56:25.397 --> 56:27.130
I was lucky to have
someone like her

56:27.132 --> 56:30.235
even interested in
anything I thought.

56:32.435 --> 56:34.105
You know what I mean?

56:35.172 --> 56:36.174
Sorry?

56:41.145 --> 56:43.179
I was saying,
you're sure the guy is here

56:43.181 --> 56:44.514
that we're looking for?

56:44.516 --> 56:47.183
Yeah, definitely.
The feather says so.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.813
Is that the guy
we're looking for?

57:18.815 --> 57:20.118
Yes.

57:22.386 --> 57:23.487
Ooh...

57:25.589 --> 57:26.956
Sorry.

57:30.661 --> 57:32.927
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry. So we actually...

57:32.929 --> 57:34.230
We were just wondering

57:34.232 --> 57:36.632
if you'd come across
a friend of ours.

57:36.634 --> 57:38.099
Tina Goldstein.

57:38.101 --> 57:40.501
<i>Monsieur,</i>
Paris is a large city.

57:40.503 --> 57:41.505
She's an Auror.

57:42.706 --> 57:44.206
And when Aurors
go missing,

57:44.208 --> 57:47.045
well, the Ministry tend
to come looking, so...

57:48.411 --> 57:50.212
No, I suppose it would
probably be better

57:50.214 --> 57:51.980
if we just report her absence.

57:51.982 --> 57:53.484
Is she tall?

57:54.985 --> 57:56.284
Dark? Rather...

57:56.286 --> 57:58.387
- Intense.
- Beautiful. She's...

57:58.389 --> 58:00.288
Yeah,
what I meant to say was...

58:00.290 --> 58:03.425
- No, she's very, very pretty.
- She's intense too.

58:03.427 --> 58:07.065
I think I saw someone
like this last night.

58:09.032 --> 58:10.933
Perhaps if I showed
you where...

58:10.935 --> 58:12.270
If you wouldn't mind.
That would be...

58:13.337 --> 58:15.373
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

58:53.578 --> 58:54.880
Tina.

58:56.313 --> 58:57.313
Newt.

58:57.315 --> 58:59.614
- <i>Expelliarmus.</i>
- Oh!

59:01.085 --> 59:04.453
My apologies,
Mr. Scamander.

59:04.455 --> 59:08.123
I shall return and release you
once Credence is dead.

59:08.125 --> 59:09.257
Kama, wait.

59:09.259 --> 59:13.297
You see,
either he dies or I do.

59:13.897 --> 59:15.498
No, no, no.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.933
Oh, no. No, no, no.

59:28.344 --> 59:30.445
Well, that's not the best
start to a rescue attempt.

59:30.447 --> 59:32.447
Oh, this was a rescue attempt?

59:32.449 --> 59:35.016
You just lost me my only lead.

59:35.018 --> 59:36.784
Well, how was
the interrogation going

59:36.786 --> 59:38.654
before we turned up?

59:41.659 --> 59:42.661
Newt!

59:46.998 --> 59:48.465
Well done, Pick.

59:50.835 --> 59:52.637
So you need this man,
you said?

59:53.371 --> 59:54.670
Yeah.

59:54.672 --> 59:58.076
I think he knows where
Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

01:00:02.147 --> 01:00:03.982
Well, that'll be that Zouwu.

01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:25.603
Come on, Newt.
Get outta there.

01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:19.157
Come on!

01:01:51.156 --> 01:01:53.054
What were
the three biggest mistakes

01:01:53.056 --> 01:01:55.157
that you made last time?

01:01:56.427 --> 01:01:58.527
- Caught by surprise, sir.
- Mmm.

01:01:58.529 --> 01:01:59.628
What else?

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.163
Didn't parry
before counter-curse, sir.

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:04.233
Very good. The last one?

01:02:04.235 --> 01:02:07.172
The most important one?

01:02:13.643 --> 01:02:16.311
Not learning
from the first two.

01:02:19.217 --> 01:02:21.817
This is a school.
You've no right.

01:02:21.819 --> 01:02:24.186
I'm the Head
of Magical Law Enforcement.

01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:26.590
I have the right to
go wherever I please.

01:02:28.259 --> 01:02:29.793
Out of here.

01:02:34.331 --> 01:02:36.266
Go with Professor McGonagall,
please.

01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:44.474
He's the best teacher
we've got.

01:02:44.476 --> 01:02:47.074
- Thanks, McLaggan.
- Get out.

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:48.545
Come, McLaggan.

01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:55.719
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

01:02:57.054 --> 01:02:58.487
Really?

01:02:58.489 --> 01:03:00.655
Cut the pretense. I know
he's there on your orders.

01:03:00.657 --> 01:03:02.358
Oh, if you'd ever had
the pleasure to teach him,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.697
you'd know Newt is not
a great follower of orders.

01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:11.065
You've read <i>The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?</i>

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:13.101
Mmm. Many years ago.

01:03:13.103 --> 01:03:15.070
"A son cruelly banished

01:03:15.072 --> 01:03:17.005
"Despair of the daughter

01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:18.643
- "Return..."
- Yes, I know it.

01:03:20.744 --> 01:03:22.376
There's a rumor
this prediction

01:03:22.378 --> 01:03:24.813
refers to the Obscurial.

01:03:24.815 --> 01:03:26.848
They say that
Grindelwald wants...

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:28.884
As a highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

01:03:28.886 --> 01:03:31.922
And yet, Scamander appears
wherever the Obscurial goes,

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.324
to protect him.

01:03:35.326 --> 01:03:36.757
Meanwhile, you've built up

01:03:36.759 --> 01:03:40.128
quite the little network
of international contacts.

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:41.864
However long you keep me

01:03:41.866 --> 01:03:43.665
and my friends
under surveillance,

01:03:43.667 --> 01:03:46.802
you're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers,

01:03:46.804 --> 01:03:48.871
because we want
the same thing.

01:03:48.873 --> 01:03:50.909
The defeat of Grindelwald.

01:03:53.645 --> 01:03:58.413
But I warn you, your policies
of suppression and violence

01:03:58.415 --> 01:04:00.550
are pushing supporters
into his arms.

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:02.954
I'm not interested
in your warnings.

01:04:04.922 --> 01:04:05.924
Now,

01:04:07.424 --> 01:04:10.159
it pains me to say it because,

01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:11.661
well, I don't like you.

01:04:13.697 --> 01:04:14.699
But

01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:19.903
you are the only wizard
who is his equal.

01:04:24.107 --> 01:04:26.443
I need you to fight him.

01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:32.717
I can't.

01:04:36.888 --> 01:04:38.422
Because of this?

01:04:46.697 --> 01:04:49.533
You and Grindelwald were
as close as brothers.

01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:53.237
Oh, we were
closer than brothers.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.451
Will you fight him?

01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:09.587
I can't.

01:05:10.955 --> 01:05:13.458
Well, then you have
chosen your side.

01:05:16.127 --> 01:05:19.395
From now on, I shall know
every spell you cast.

01:05:19.397 --> 01:05:21.096
I'm doubling the watch on you,

01:05:21.098 --> 01:05:24.034
and you will no longer teach
Defence Against the Dark Arts.

01:05:26.002 --> 01:05:27.838
Where's Leta?
We need to go to Paris.

01:05:34.177 --> 01:05:35.844
Theseus.

01:05:35.846 --> 01:05:38.516
Theseus,
if Grindelwald calls a rally,

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.583
don't try and break it up.

01:05:41.585 --> 01:05:43.620
Don't let Travers
send you in there.

01:05:45.322 --> 01:05:46.855
If you ever trusted me...

01:05:46.857 --> 01:05:48.293
Theseus.

01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:50.027
Theseus!

01:06:31.268 --> 01:06:33.168
<i>Even the name
Lestrange makes me feel sick.</i>

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.003
You know she stays here
every vacation.

01:06:35.005 --> 01:06:36.871
Her family don't
actually want her home.

01:06:36.873 --> 01:06:38.672
I don't blame them.
She's so annoying.

01:06:38.674 --> 01:06:40.007
Did you see her last week?

01:06:40.009 --> 01:06:41.078
<i>Oscausi!</i>

01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:47.616
Professor McGonagall...

01:06:47.618 --> 01:06:48.851
Lestrange has done it again!

01:06:48.853 --> 01:06:51.320
Lestrange, stop running!

01:06:51.322 --> 01:06:53.221
Lestrange!
Disobedient children.

01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:54.523
Leta, come back!

01:06:54.525 --> 01:06:56.525
Stop! Shame on
the House of Slytherin.

01:06:56.527 --> 01:06:57.893
100 points!

01:06:57.895 --> 01:06:59.059
200!

01:06:59.061 --> 01:07:00.864
Get back here, right now!

01:07:02.031 --> 01:07:05.701
Children, stop it!
You, stop! Come back!

01:07:05.703 --> 01:07:07.936
- Out of my way!
- Where has she gone?

01:07:07.938 --> 01:07:09.974
I think
she went that way!

01:07:12.909 --> 01:07:14.911
Miss, it was Lestrange.
She's horrible.

01:07:24.587 --> 01:07:27.121
Scamander,
why aren't you packing?

01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:28.826
I'm not going home.

01:07:29.826 --> 01:07:31.460
Why not?

01:07:31.462 --> 01:07:33.563
He needs me.

01:07:38.969 --> 01:07:40.670
He was hurt.

01:07:47.444 --> 01:07:49.511
What is that?

01:07:49.513 --> 01:07:51.014
A raven chick.

01:07:52.616 --> 01:07:55.016
Isn't the raven
your family emblem?

01:07:55.018 --> 01:07:56.753
Yes, it is.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.166
<i>All right, Newt.</i>

01:08:11.168 --> 01:08:12.770
<i>Be brave.</i>

01:08:17.107 --> 01:08:18.741
That's an unusual one.

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:21.643
So Mr. Scamander fears what

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:23.612
more than anything else
in the world?

01:08:23.613 --> 01:08:26.381
Having to work
in an office, sir.

01:08:26.383 --> 01:08:28.652
Go ahead, Newt.

01:08:31.688 --> 01:08:33.386
<i>Riddikulus.</i>

01:08:33.389 --> 01:08:35.524
Well done.

01:08:35.526 --> 01:08:36.993
Good job. Leta.

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:41.229
It's only a Boggart.

01:08:41.231 --> 01:08:43.200
It can't hurt you.

01:08:45.035 --> 01:08:47.772
Everyone is
scared of something.

01:08:49.072 --> 01:08:51.075
I've been looking
forward to this.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:37.822
I don't want to talk about it.

01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:54.804
They know me,

01:09:55.771 --> 01:09:57.240
or they'd hide.

01:10:00.143 --> 01:10:02.946
They only nest in trees
with wand-quality wood.

01:10:04.647 --> 01:10:06.583
Did you know that?

01:10:08.017 --> 01:10:12.186
And they have
very complex social lives.

01:10:12.188 --> 01:10:15.560
If you watch them for
long enough, you realize...

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.246
Hello, Leta.
This is a surprise.

01:10:39.749 --> 01:10:41.685
Finding me in a classroom?

01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:44.987
Was I such a bad student?

01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:46.887
On the contrary,
you were one of my cleverest.

01:10:46.889 --> 01:10:48.926
I said bad, not stupid.

01:10:54.498 --> 01:10:56.100
Don't bother answering.

01:10:57.566 --> 01:10:58.699
I know you never liked me.

01:10:58.701 --> 01:11:00.236
Well, you're wrong.

01:11:00.937 --> 01:11:02.304
I never thought you bad.

01:11:02.306 --> 01:11:05.506
You were alone, then.
Everybody else did.

01:11:05.508 --> 01:11:07.043
And they were right.

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:10.546
I was wicked.

01:11:10.548 --> 01:11:12.680
Leta, I know how painful
the rumors about

01:11:12.682 --> 01:11:14.649
your brother Corvus
must be for you.

01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:16.220
No, you don't.

01:11:17.387 --> 01:11:20.087
Not unless you had
a brother who died, too.

01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:22.627
In my case, it was my sister.

01:11:25.395 --> 01:11:27.098
Did you love her?

01:11:35.606 --> 01:11:37.407
Not as well as
I should have done.

01:11:41.143 --> 01:11:43.213
Never too late
to free yourself.

01:11:45.315 --> 01:11:50.120
Confession is a relief, I'm
told. A great weight lifted.

01:11:53.923 --> 01:11:56.958
Regret is
my constant companion.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.362
Do not let it become yours.

01:12:09.807 --> 01:12:11.840
Oh! No, thank you.

01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:15.275
Well, you've been really kind,

01:12:15.277 --> 01:12:19.547
but my sister Tina's probably
worried sick about me.

01:12:19.549 --> 01:12:22.953
You know, banging on
all the doors and things,

01:12:24.187 --> 01:12:25.554
so I think
I'd better be going.

01:12:25.556 --> 01:12:28.355
But you haven't met your host.

01:12:28.357 --> 01:12:30.061
Oh, are you married?

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:32.129
Let's say,

01:12:33.297 --> 01:12:35.266
deeply committed.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.471
You see, I can't tell if you're
making a joke or if you're just...

01:12:42.239 --> 01:12:43.473
French.

01:12:49.478 --> 01:12:50.714
Oh.

01:12:53.049 --> 01:12:56.052
Hey, knock it off.

01:13:03.026 --> 01:13:04.926
You stay right there.

01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:06.964
I know what you are.

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.032
Queenie.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.899
We are not here to hurt you.

01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:14.871
We only want to help you.

01:13:16.339 --> 01:13:19.908
You're so very,
very far away from home.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.975
Far away from
everything you love.

01:13:21.977 --> 01:13:24.248
Everything
that is comfortable.

01:13:26.549 --> 01:13:29.052
I would never see you harmed.

01:13:29.719 --> 01:13:31.054
Ever.

01:13:32.422 --> 01:13:36.494
It is not your fault
that your sister is an Auror.

01:13:38.329 --> 01:13:41.162
I wish you were working
with me now,

01:13:41.164 --> 01:13:43.398
towards a world
where we wizards

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.237
were free to live openly.

01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:50.206
To love freely.

01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:03.854
You are an innocent.

01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:07.423
So go now.

01:14:09.392 --> 01:14:11.027
Leave this place.

01:15:33.944 --> 01:15:38.145
Hey, Newt, buddy.

01:15:38.147 --> 01:15:40.448
Tina's up here.
She's all by her lonesome,

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.851
and maybe you want to come up
and keep her company?

01:15:43.853 --> 01:15:47.055
I've been looking for food
and I ain't found any,

01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:50.457
so I guess I'm gonna
go upstairs and try my luck

01:15:50.459 --> 01:15:53.129
in the, oh, I don't know,
the attic.

01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:55.896
You're all right.

01:15:55.898 --> 01:15:57.301
<i>Relashio.</i>

01:16:03.374 --> 01:16:04.375
Okay.

01:16:17.053 --> 01:16:19.056
She's responded well
to the Dittany.

01:16:20.156 --> 01:16:22.323
She was born to run, you see.

01:16:22.325 --> 01:16:26.228
But I think she's just
lacking in confidence.

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.095
Mr. Scamander,
have you got anything

01:16:28.097 --> 01:16:29.532
in your case that might help
revive this man?

01:16:30.334 --> 01:16:31.600
I need to question him.

01:16:31.602 --> 01:16:33.167
I think he knows
who Credence really is.

01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:34.635
And the scars on his hand

01:16:34.637 --> 01:16:36.269
- suggest an Unbreakable Vow.
- An Unbreakable Vow.

01:16:36.271 --> 01:16:38.207
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

01:16:49.819 --> 01:16:51.021
<i>Lumos.</i>

01:16:58.027 --> 01:16:59.426
What was that?

01:16:59.428 --> 01:17:02.663
There must be
a Water Dragon in that sewer.

01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:06.100
They carry these parasites,
you see. They, um...

01:17:06.102 --> 01:17:09.371
- Jacob.
- Yeah?

01:17:09.373 --> 01:17:11.171
In my case,
in the pocket there,

01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:13.074
you'll find
a pair of tweezers.

01:17:13.076 --> 01:17:14.609
Tweezers?

01:17:14.611 --> 01:17:16.543
- They're thin, pointy...
- Little pointy things.

01:17:16.545 --> 01:17:18.214
Yes,
I know what tweezers are.

01:17:20.816 --> 01:17:22.986
All right. You might not
want to watch this.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.189
I can handle it.

01:17:29.825 --> 01:17:31.326
Come out.

01:17:31.328 --> 01:17:33.894
Come on. You're all right.

01:17:33.896 --> 01:17:37.530
- Ew.
- Come on. I got you.

01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:39.134
Jacob, will you
take that for me?

01:17:39.136 --> 01:17:41.304
Huh. Ugh!

01:17:43.406 --> 01:17:44.407
Calamari.

01:17:46.977 --> 01:17:48.975
Must kill him.

01:17:48.977 --> 01:17:50.144
Who?

01:17:50.146 --> 01:17:52.779
Credence?

01:17:52.781 --> 01:17:54.614
It may take him
a few hours to recover.

01:17:54.616 --> 01:17:58.420
That parasite's poison
is quite strong.

01:17:58.422 --> 01:18:00.723
I have to go back to the
Ministry with what I've got.

01:18:02.726 --> 01:18:04.458
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Scamander.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:06.827
Hey. Hey,
hold on a second, will ya?

01:18:06.829 --> 01:18:08.497
Well, hold on, hold on.

01:18:08.499 --> 01:18:10.067
Wait! Tina.

01:18:14.838 --> 01:18:16.636
You didn't mention
salamanders, did you?

01:18:16.638 --> 01:18:19.575
No, I didn't.
She just ran. I don't know...

01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:23.310
So you chase after her.

01:18:23.312 --> 01:18:26.514
Tina. Please,
just listen to me.

01:18:26.516 --> 01:18:29.783
Mr. Scamander, I need to
go talk to the Ministry.

01:18:29.785 --> 01:18:32.186
I know how you feel
about Aurors.

01:18:32.188 --> 01:18:33.520
I may have been
a little strong in the way

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:34.988
that I expressed myself
in that letter.

01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:36.224
What was the exact phrase?

01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:38.260
"A bunch of
careerist hypocrites"?

01:18:38.262 --> 01:18:39.594
I'm sorry, but I can't
admire people

01:18:39.596 --> 01:18:41.262
whose answer to everything
that they fear

01:18:41.264 --> 01:18:42.997
or misunderstand
is "kill it."

01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:44.466
I'm an Auror and I don't.

01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:46.437
Yes, I know. That's because
you've gone middle head.

01:18:48.637 --> 01:18:50.270
Excuse me?

01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:51.439
It's an expression
derived from

01:18:51.441 --> 01:18:52.573
the three heads
of the Runespoor.

01:18:52.575 --> 01:18:54.341
So the middle one
is the visionary.

01:18:54.343 --> 01:18:56.277
Now, every Auror in Europe
wants Credence dead, except you.

01:18:56.279 --> 01:18:57.781
You've gone middle head.

01:18:59.215 --> 01:19:02.352
Who else uses that expression,
Mr. Scamander?

01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:05.455
I think it might just be me.

01:19:23.505 --> 01:19:26.709
It's Grindelwald.
He's calling his followers.

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:58.208
It's too late. Grindelwald
has come for Credence.

01:19:59.743 --> 01:20:02.542
- He might already have him.
- It's not too late.

01:20:02.544 --> 01:20:04.413
We can still get to him first.

01:20:06.782 --> 01:20:08.216
Where are you going?

01:20:08.218 --> 01:20:09.750
The French Ministry of Magic.

01:20:09.752 --> 01:20:11.819
That's the last place
Credence would go.

01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:14.688
There's a box hidden
in the Ministry, Tina.

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.823
It's a box that can tell us
who Credence really is.

01:20:16.825 --> 01:20:19.627
A box?
What are you talking about?

01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:20.630
Trust me.

01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:26.734
You wanna come out,
just for a little while?

01:20:26.736 --> 01:20:28.271
You can be free.

01:20:36.713 --> 01:20:37.714
Credence.

01:20:46.255 --> 01:20:47.354
What do you want?

01:20:47.356 --> 01:20:48.692
From you?

01:20:49.792 --> 01:20:50.794
Nothing.

01:20:53.695 --> 01:20:54.764
For you?

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.669
Everything I never had.

01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:02.940
But what is it you want,
my boy?

01:21:03.839 --> 01:21:05.808
I want to know who I am.

01:21:14.784 --> 01:21:20.257
This is where you will find
proof of your true identity.

01:21:24.995 --> 01:21:27.194
Come to Pere Lachaise tonight,

01:21:27.196 --> 01:21:29.632
and you will discover
the truth.

01:21:46.715 --> 01:21:48.919
Father, why did you make me...

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.623
Wait...

01:21:54.324 --> 01:21:55.890
Wait.

01:22:17.045 --> 01:22:19.883
I'm afraid we keep
no food in the house.

01:22:21.752 --> 01:22:23.650
Are you a ghost?

01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:24.754
No.

01:22:25.355 --> 01:22:28.655
No. I'm alive.

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:31.861
But I'm an alchemist
and therefore immortal.

01:22:33.429 --> 01:22:36.130
You don't look a day over 375.

01:22:38.901 --> 01:22:40.935
I'm sorry that
we didn't knock.

01:22:40.937 --> 01:22:42.737
No. No matter.

01:22:42.739 --> 01:22:45.375
Albus told me some friends
might be dropping in.

01:22:46.174 --> 01:22:47.811
Nicolas Flamel.

01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:50.580
Oh.

01:22:51.446 --> 01:22:52.613
Jacob Kowalski.

01:22:52.615 --> 01:22:53.884
Oh!

01:22:55.317 --> 01:22:57.417
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

01:22:57.419 --> 01:22:58.954
- I didn't...
- Oh...

01:22:59.422 --> 01:23:00.790
Oh!

01:23:11.366 --> 01:23:13.533
At last, we see
some development.

01:23:13.535 --> 01:23:15.903
Yeah. I've seen
one of these before.

01:23:15.905 --> 01:23:18.105
It was at the fair.

01:23:18.107 --> 01:23:19.940
There was this dame there
and she had a veil,

01:23:19.942 --> 01:23:21.375
and I gave her a nickel,

01:23:21.377 --> 01:23:23.844
and she told me
about my future.

01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:27.017
And she missed out
on quite a bit, actually.

01:23:30.553 --> 01:23:32.122
Oh. Hey, hey.

01:23:33.188 --> 01:23:34.320
Wait a minute, I know him.

01:23:34.322 --> 01:23:35.892
That's the kid.
That's Credence.

01:23:38.495 --> 01:23:39.696
Jeez.

01:23:41.397 --> 01:23:43.898
Hey... Hey!

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.868
That's Queenie. There she is.
Hi, baby.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:49.369
Where is this? Is this here?

01:23:49.371 --> 01:23:51.773
Yes.
This is the Lestrange tomb.

01:23:51.775 --> 01:23:54.578
It lies in the cemetery
of Pere Lachaise.

01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:57.511
I'm coming, baby.
Stay right there.

01:23:57.513 --> 01:23:58.845
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.

01:23:58.847 --> 01:24:02.550
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

01:24:02.552 --> 01:24:05.685
Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles
for me. Oh, no.

01:24:05.687 --> 01:24:07.154
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

01:24:07.156 --> 01:24:08.691
Please, you mustn't
go to the cemetery.

01:24:30.679 --> 01:24:33.046
What's happening?

01:24:33.048 --> 01:24:35.983
Exactly what
he said would happen.

01:24:35.985 --> 01:24:38.385
Grindelwald rallies
at the cemetery tonight,

01:24:38.387 --> 01:24:40.054
and there will be death.

01:24:40.056 --> 01:24:41.221
Then you gotta go.

01:24:41.223 --> 01:24:43.957
What? I haven't seen action
in 200 years.

01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:47.430
Flamel, you can do this.
We believe in you.

01:24:56.039 --> 01:24:58.506
The box is in the Ancestral
Records room, Tina.

01:24:58.508 --> 01:25:00.140
So it's three floors down.

01:25:00.142 --> 01:25:01.309
Is that Polyjuice?

01:25:01.311 --> 01:25:03.045
It's just enough
to get me inside.

01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:14.288
- Who?
- It's my brother Theseus.

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:17.127
He's an Auror and a hugger.

01:25:19.294 --> 01:25:20.694
What's happening?

01:25:20.696 --> 01:25:21.828
Grindelwald's rallying.
We don't know where,

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:23.199
but we think it's tonight.

01:25:27.937 --> 01:25:29.769
- Be careful.
- Of course.

01:25:29.771 --> 01:25:30.971
Promise me you'll be careful.

01:25:30.973 --> 01:25:33.073
Of course.
I'm gonna be careful.

01:25:33.075 --> 01:25:35.109
Listen, I want you to
hear this from me.

01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:37.377
They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.

01:25:37.379 --> 01:25:39.146
- My brother is dead.
- I know.

01:25:39.148 --> 01:25:40.515
- He died.
- I know.

01:25:40.517 --> 01:25:43.783
- How many times, Theseus?
- And the records will prove that.

01:25:43.785 --> 01:25:46.252
Okay? They can't lie.

01:25:46.254 --> 01:25:47.490
Theseus.

01:25:52.895 --> 01:25:54.761
I want every person
at that rally arrested.

01:25:54.763 --> 01:25:55.996
If they resist...

01:25:55.998 --> 01:25:57.364
Sir, forgive me,
but if we go in too heavy

01:25:57.366 --> 01:25:58.299
don't we run the risk
of adding to the...

01:25:58.301 --> 01:25:59.602
Just do it.

01:26:16.753 --> 01:26:18.118
I don't suppose
you can Disapparate

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.087
on Ministry premises
in France, can you?

01:26:20.089 --> 01:26:21.555
Nope.

01:26:21.557 --> 01:26:24.190
Pity.

01:26:24.192 --> 01:26:26.663
- Newt!
- Yes, I know. I know it's...

01:26:31.567 --> 01:26:32.902
Newt!

01:26:33.904 --> 01:26:35.036
Newt!

01:26:35.038 --> 01:26:36.470
- Oh!
- That's your brother?

01:26:36.472 --> 01:26:38.104
So I think I may have
mentioned in my letters

01:26:38.106 --> 01:26:39.540
that we have quite
a complicated relationship.

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:40.741
Newt, stop!

01:26:40.743 --> 01:26:42.078
- Does he wanna kill you?
- Frequently.

01:26:43.312 --> 01:26:44.313
Enough!

01:26:50.652 --> 01:26:52.923
He needs to
control his temper.

01:26:57.927 --> 01:27:00.230
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

01:27:44.941 --> 01:27:46.009
Queenie.

01:27:50.846 --> 01:27:52.248
Queenie, honey.

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.920
Don't. Don't move.

01:28:07.963 --> 01:28:10.132
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

01:28:14.203 --> 01:28:16.436
And I'm her...

01:28:16.438 --> 01:28:17.604
Fiance.

01:28:23.245 --> 01:28:24.748
Thank you.

01:28:36.325 --> 01:28:38.292
Tina, about that
fiancee business...

01:28:38.294 --> 01:28:40.793
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I should have
congratulated you.

01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:42.731
- No, that's...
- <i>Lumos.</i>

01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:47.170
Lestrange.

01:28:53.609 --> 01:28:55.042
Tina, about Leta...

01:28:55.044 --> 01:28:57.211
Yes, I've just said
I am happy for you.

01:28:57.213 --> 01:29:00.050
No, well, I don't...
Please, don't be happy.

01:29:01.883 --> 01:29:03.752
No, no. Sorry. I don't...

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.519
Obviously, I...

01:29:06.521 --> 01:29:08.989
Obviously, I want you to be...

01:29:08.991 --> 01:29:13.795
And I hear that you are now.
Which is wonderful.

01:29:13.797 --> 01:29:16.997
Sorry, what I'm trying to say
is, I want you to be happy,

01:29:16.999 --> 01:29:18.198
but I don't want you
to be happy

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.203
that I'm happy,
because I'm not.

01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:25.439
Happy.

01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:26.810
Or engaged.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:29.743
What?

01:29:29.745 --> 01:29:31.112
It was a mistake
in a stupid magazine.

01:29:31.114 --> 01:29:32.380
My brother's marrying Leta,
June the 6th.

01:29:32.382 --> 01:29:34.284
I'm supposed to be
best man, which is

01:29:35.049 --> 01:29:38.085
sort of mildly hilarious.

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:40.824
Does he think you're here
to win her back?

01:29:43.092 --> 01:29:44.824
Are you here to win her back?

01:29:44.826 --> 01:29:46.295
No, I'm here...

01:29:50.298 --> 01:29:52.868
You know,
your eyes really are...

01:29:55.538 --> 01:29:57.005
Are what?

01:29:57.839 --> 01:29:59.743
I'm not supposed to say.

01:30:02.844 --> 01:30:04.778
- I cut a picture of you...
- Newt, I read your book and...

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:06.381
- Wait, did you read...
- Did you?

01:30:12.254 --> 01:30:14.153
I cut this, um...

01:30:14.155 --> 01:30:17.524
I mean, it's just a picture
of you from the paper,

01:30:17.526 --> 01:30:20.463
but it's interesting 'cause
your eyes in newsprint...

01:30:22.463 --> 01:30:26.399
See, in reality they have
this effect in them, Tina.

01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:29.371
It's like fire in water,
in dark water.

01:30:32.807 --> 01:30:35.011
And I've only ever
seen that...

01:30:37.312 --> 01:30:40.083
I've only ever seen that in...

01:30:44.254 --> 01:30:45.789
Salamanders.

01:30:50.192 --> 01:30:51.194
Come.

01:30:56.865 --> 01:30:58.066
Lestrange.

01:31:02.871 --> 01:31:04.206
Whoa!

01:31:42.579 --> 01:31:47.282
"Records moved to Lestrange
family tomb at Pere Lachaise."

01:32:01.563 --> 01:32:02.999
<i>Circumrota.</i>

01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:15.078
Hello, Newt.

01:32:19.581 --> 01:32:20.883
Hello, Leta.

01:32:24.919 --> 01:32:26.121
Hi.

01:32:29.157 --> 01:32:30.459
Oh, no.

01:32:35.463 --> 01:32:37.096
What kinda cats
are those?

01:32:37.098 --> 01:32:39.131
These aren't cats.
They're Matagots.

01:32:39.133 --> 01:32:40.766
They're spirit familiars.

01:32:40.768 --> 01:32:42.502
They guard the Ministry.

01:32:42.504 --> 01:32:44.337
But they won't hurt you
unless you...

01:32:44.339 --> 01:32:45.440
<i>Stupefy!</i>

01:32:46.842 --> 01:32:48.041
Unless you attack them.

01:32:48.043 --> 01:32:50.176
Oops.

01:32:50.178 --> 01:32:52.014
- Leta.
- <i>Reverte.</i>

01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:19.208
<i>Accio!</i>

01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:31.954
<i>Ascendio!</i>

01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:23.706
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:28.344
Okay. Wait. Hold it there.
Hold it there, please.

01:34:29.712 --> 01:34:32.112
Come on.

01:34:32.114 --> 01:34:33.646
Oh!

01:34:33.648 --> 01:34:34.750
All right.

01:34:38.186 --> 01:34:39.519
Okay, wait.

01:34:53.502 --> 01:34:56.339
You, go back. Move!
Out of the way!

01:34:57.705 --> 01:35:00.243
If I must kill you
as well as Corvus, I shall.

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:02.411
Stop!

01:35:06.782 --> 01:35:07.784
Yusuf.

01:35:09.183 --> 01:35:11.087
Is that really you?

01:35:16.926 --> 01:35:18.761
My little sister?

01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:23.266
So he's your brother.

01:35:24.866 --> 01:35:26.535
Who am I?

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:28.702
I don't know.

01:35:28.704 --> 01:35:32.241
I'm tired of living with
no name and no history.

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:36.877
Just tell me my story,
then you can end it.

01:35:36.879 --> 01:35:38.614
Your story is our story.

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:44.016
Our story.

01:35:44.018 --> 01:35:45.554
No, Yusuf.

01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:04.770
My father was Mustafa Kama,

01:36:04.772 --> 01:36:06.439
pureblood of
Senegalese descent

01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:08.611
and most accomplished.

01:36:09.844 --> 01:36:11.580
My mother, Laurena,

01:36:12.748 --> 01:36:15.884
was equally highbred,
a noted beauty.

01:36:17.186 --> 01:36:18.588
<i>They were deeply in love.</i>

01:36:20.455 --> 01:36:22.689
<i>They knew a man
of great influence</i>

01:36:22.691 --> 01:36:25.194
<i>from a famous French
pureblood family.</i>

01:36:26.928 --> 01:36:29.095
<i>He desired her.</i>

01:36:32.368 --> 01:36:35.336
<i>Lestrange used
the Imperius curse</i>

01:36:35.338 --> 01:36:38.639
<i>to seduce and abduct her.</i>

01:36:38.641 --> 01:36:41.511
I tried to prevent it,
but he attacked me.

01:36:43.111 --> 01:36:45.248
That was the last time
I ever saw her.

01:36:47.548 --> 01:36:51.219
<i>She died giving birth
to a little girl.</i>

01:36:52.221 --> 01:36:53.556
You.

01:36:56.924 --> 01:37:02.028
<i>The news of her death
drove my father insane.</i>

01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:04.398
With his dying breath

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.370
my father charged me
to seek revenge.

01:37:10.039 --> 01:37:13.739
Kill the person Lestrange
loves best in the world.

01:37:13.741 --> 01:37:16.743
I thought at first
it'd be easy.

01:37:16.745 --> 01:37:18.848
He had only one
close relative.

01:37:19.947 --> 01:37:21.180
You.

01:37:21.182 --> 01:37:22.882
But he...

01:37:22.884 --> 01:37:24.253
Say it.

01:37:24.986 --> 01:37:26.689
He never loved you.

01:37:30.659 --> 01:37:33.829
<i>He remarried not three months
after her death.</i>

01:37:37.499 --> 01:37:39.834
<i>He loved her no more
than he had loved you.</i>

01:37:43.672 --> 01:37:48.207
<i>But then his son, Corvus,
was born at last.</i>

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:53.579
<i>And that man who had never
known love was filled with it.</i>

01:37:53.581 --> 01:37:56.015
<i>All he cared about</i>

01:37:56.017 --> 01:37:57.752
was little Corvus.

01:38:01.155 --> 01:38:02.924
So this is the truth?

01:38:04.258 --> 01:38:06.126
I am Corvus Lestrange?

01:38:06.128 --> 01:38:07.226
- Yes.
- No.

01:38:07.228 --> 01:38:08.961
- Yes.
- No.

01:38:08.963 --> 01:38:11.730
Realizing that Mustafa
Kama's son had sworn revenge,

01:38:11.732 --> 01:38:15.335
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

01:38:15.337 --> 01:38:18.238
So he confided you
to his servant,

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.773
who boarded
a ship for America.

01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:21.440
He did send Corvus
to America, but...

01:38:21.442 --> 01:38:23.510
His servant,
Irma Dugard,

01:38:23.512 --> 01:38:25.144
was a half-elf.

01:38:25.146 --> 01:38:26.813
Her magic was weak,

01:38:26.815 --> 01:38:29.285
and therefore left no trace
I could follow.

01:38:30.852 --> 01:38:34.587
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped,

01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:37.357
when I received news
I never expected.

01:38:37.359 --> 01:38:40.594
The ship had gone down at sea.

01:38:40.596 --> 01:38:43.496
But you survived, didn't you?

01:38:43.498 --> 01:38:47.634
Somehow, someone had
pulled you from the water.

01:38:47.636 --> 01:38:50.168
"A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter

01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:53.506
"Return, great avenger,
With wings from the water."

01:38:53.508 --> 01:38:56.175
There stands
the despairing daughter.

01:38:56.177 --> 01:38:57.877
You are the winged raven,

01:38:57.879 --> 01:38:59.681
returned from the sea,
but I...

01:39:00.248 --> 01:39:01.515
I...

01:39:01.517 --> 01:39:03.786
I'm the avenger
of my family's ruin.

01:39:06.387 --> 01:39:08.290
I pity you, Corvus.

01:39:10.057 --> 01:39:11.524
But you must die.

01:39:11.526 --> 01:39:14.663
Corvus Lestrange is
already dead! I killed him!

01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:22.070
<i>Accio!</i>

01:39:39.821 --> 01:39:42.924
My father owned
a very strange family tree.

01:39:46.593 --> 01:39:48.630
It only recorded the men.

01:39:52.801 --> 01:39:55.404
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.775
Beautiful.

01:40:01.977 --> 01:40:03.112
Separate.

01:40:05.646 --> 01:40:07.882
<i>My father sent me to America
with Corvus.</i>

01:40:13.856 --> 01:40:15.154
<i>Irma was to pose
as a grandmother</i>

01:40:15.156 --> 01:40:16.825
<i>with two grandchildren.</i>

01:40:22.431 --> 01:40:24.799
<i>Corvus never stopped crying.</i>

01:40:29.170 --> 01:40:30.537
Do you have any news?

01:40:30.539 --> 01:40:32.872
All hands to station!

01:40:32.874 --> 01:40:34.810
Run to station!

01:40:43.118 --> 01:40:44.954
<i>I never wanted to hurt him.</i>

01:40:50.726 --> 01:40:53.460
<i>I only wanted
to be free of him.</i>

01:40:53.462 --> 01:40:54.996
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

01:41:00.235 --> 01:41:02.605
<i>Just a single moment.</i>

01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:09.412
Give him to me.

01:41:10.344 --> 01:41:11.711
Everyone,
to the lifeboats!

01:41:11.713 --> 01:41:14.082
They want us to
put on life jackets.

01:42:13.241 --> 01:42:15.578
You didn't mean
to do it, Leta.

01:42:17.678 --> 01:42:19.681
So it wasn't your fault.

01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:23.686
Oh, Newt.

01:42:27.856 --> 01:42:30.159
You never met a monster
you couldn't love.

01:42:35.164 --> 01:42:37.029
Leta,

01:42:37.031 --> 01:42:39.601
do you know
who Credence really is?

01:42:40.634 --> 01:42:43.269
Did you know
when you swapped them?

01:42:43.271 --> 01:42:44.540
No.

01:43:07.395 --> 01:43:08.763
Queenie?

01:43:35.824 --> 01:43:37.556
They're purebloods.

01:43:37.558 --> 01:43:39.194
They kill the likes of us
for sport.

01:43:41.797 --> 01:43:44.698
- Queenie?
- Jacob!

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.733
Honey, you're here! Hi!

01:43:46.735 --> 01:43:48.600
Hi, hon. Hi.

01:43:48.602 --> 01:43:50.470
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

01:43:50.472 --> 01:43:52.905
I never should have done it.
I love you so much.

01:43:52.907 --> 01:43:54.908
And you know
that I love you, right?

01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:56.076
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:43:56.078 --> 01:43:57.377
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:43:57.379 --> 01:43:59.214
Oh, no, wait. Wait a second.

01:44:01.182 --> 01:44:04.119
I just thought maybe we could
hear him first, you know.

01:44:04.852 --> 01:44:07.155
Just listen. That's all.

01:44:08.057 --> 01:44:09.825
What are you talking about?

01:44:14.730 --> 01:44:16.462
It's a trap.

01:44:16.464 --> 01:44:17.665
Yeah.

01:44:18.865 --> 01:44:20.966
Queenie, the family tree.

01:44:20.968 --> 01:44:22.203
It's all been bait.

01:44:23.704 --> 01:44:25.975
We have to find
a way out of here right now.

01:44:27.676 --> 01:44:29.308
You go find the others.

01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:30.976
What are you gonna do?

01:44:30.978 --> 01:44:32.780
I'll think of something.

01:45:20.895 --> 01:45:24.365
My brothers, my sisters,

01:45:25.834 --> 01:45:27.900
my friends,

01:45:27.902 --> 01:45:31.973
the great gift of your
applause is not for me. No.

01:45:32.773 --> 01:45:35.343
It is for yourselves.

01:45:37.379 --> 01:45:39.815
You came today
because of a craving

01:45:41.848 --> 01:45:43.384
and a knowledge

01:45:44.919 --> 01:45:48.123
that the old ways
serve us no longer.

01:45:51.026 --> 01:45:55.097
You came today because
you crave something new.

01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:58.200
Something different.

01:46:00.802 --> 01:46:02.635
It is said

01:46:02.637 --> 01:46:06.141
that I hate <i>les non-Magiques.</i>

01:46:07.241 --> 01:46:08.375
The Muggles.

01:46:08.377 --> 01:46:10.446
- Vermin!
- The No-Maj.

01:46:11.545 --> 01:46:13.214
The Can't-Spells.

01:46:14.915 --> 01:46:16.884
I do not hate them.

01:46:17.619 --> 01:46:19.088
I do not.

01:46:20.655 --> 01:46:22.957
For I do not fight
out of hatred.

01:46:25.226 --> 01:46:29.098
I say the Muggles
are not lesser,

01:46:29.897 --> 01:46:31.333
but other.

01:46:32.299 --> 01:46:33.802
Not worthless,

01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:37.938
but of other value.

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:42.277
Not disposable, but of
a different disposition.

01:46:43.477 --> 01:46:45.480
Magic blooms

01:46:47.548 --> 01:46:50.752
only in rare souls.

01:46:52.387 --> 01:46:57.456
It is granted to those
who live for higher things.

01:46:57.458 --> 01:47:01.060
Oh, and what a world we would
make for all of humanity,

01:47:01.062 --> 01:47:04.032
we who live for freedom,

01:47:05.499 --> 01:47:06.834
for truth,

01:47:09.337 --> 01:47:10.539
and for love.

01:47:20.816 --> 01:47:23.716
It isn't illegal
to listen to him.

01:47:23.718 --> 01:47:25.420
Use minimum force
on the crowd.

01:47:27.021 --> 01:47:28.924
We mustn't be
what he says we are.

01:47:34.661 --> 01:47:36.429
The moment has come

01:47:36.431 --> 01:47:39.433
to share my vision
of the future

01:47:41.069 --> 01:47:44.539
that awaits
if we do not rise up

01:47:46.107 --> 01:47:48.976
and take our rightful place

01:47:49.544 --> 01:47:51.346
in the world.

01:48:35.389 --> 01:48:37.325
Not another war.

01:48:42.163 --> 01:48:46.133
That is what we are fighting.

01:48:47.201 --> 01:48:48.904
That is the enemy.

01:48:50.672 --> 01:48:52.074
Their arrogance.

01:48:53.475 --> 01:48:55.244
Their power lust.

01:48:57.445 --> 01:48:58.980
Their barbarity.

01:49:00.548 --> 01:49:04.518
How long will it take before
they turn their weapons on us?

01:49:06.855 --> 01:49:09.290
Do nothing
when I speak of this.

01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:12.160
You must remain calm

01:49:14.195 --> 01:49:16.231
and contain your emotions.

01:49:20.468 --> 01:49:22.702
There are Aurors
here among us.

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.683
Come closer, brother wizards.
Join us.

01:49:37.486 --> 01:49:38.620
Do nothing.

01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.255
And no force.

01:49:56.637 --> 01:50:00.174
They have killed
many of my followers.

01:50:00.776 --> 01:50:02.110
It is true.

01:50:03.145 --> 01:50:05.077
They confined me

01:50:05.079 --> 01:50:08.648
and tortured me in New York.

01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:13.021
They had struck down their
fellow witches and wizards.

01:50:14.321 --> 01:50:19.060
For the simple crime
of seeking the truth.

01:50:20.661 --> 01:50:22.496
For wanting freedom.

01:50:26.868 --> 01:50:31.039
Your anger, your desire
for revenge is natural.

01:50:34.642 --> 01:50:35.643
No!

01:51:06.473 --> 01:51:10.344
Take this young warrior
back to her family.

01:51:18.486 --> 01:51:19.620
Disapparate.

01:51:20.121 --> 01:51:22.287
Leave.

01:51:22.289 --> 01:51:25.493
Go forth from this place
and spread the word.

01:51:26.794 --> 01:51:30.231
It is not we who are violent.

01:51:48.048 --> 01:51:49.450
Let's take him.

01:52:18.312 --> 01:52:22.350
Aurors, join me
in this circle.

01:52:24.018 --> 01:52:25.553
Pledge to me

01:52:26.754 --> 01:52:28.422
your eternal allegiance

01:52:29.123 --> 01:52:30.655
or die.

01:52:30.657 --> 01:52:33.292
Only here shall
you know freedom.

01:52:33.294 --> 01:52:36.331
Only here shall
you know yourself.

01:52:43.271 --> 01:52:44.970
Play by the rules!

01:52:44.972 --> 01:52:46.841
No cheating, children.

01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:54.413
He knows who I am.

01:52:54.415 --> 01:52:56.683
He knows what you were born,

01:52:56.685 --> 01:52:58.117
not who you are!

01:52:58.119 --> 01:52:59.353
Credence!

01:53:14.169 --> 01:53:16.805
Queenie, honey. Queenie.
You gotta wake up.

01:53:18.606 --> 01:53:19.673
Jacob.

01:53:20.342 --> 01:53:21.907
He's the answer.

01:53:21.909 --> 01:53:23.208
He wants what we want.

01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:24.812
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

01:53:34.489 --> 01:53:37.659
This has all been for you,
Credence.

01:53:40.428 --> 01:53:42.164
Walk with me.

01:53:43.998 --> 01:53:45.363
Hon. No!

01:53:45.365 --> 01:53:47.268
Walk with me!

01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:50.605
You're crazy.

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:53.942
Queenie.

01:53:54.575 --> 01:53:55.506
No!

01:53:55.508 --> 01:53:57.712
Queenie, don't do it!

01:54:05.285 --> 01:54:06.487
Queenie.

01:54:08.955 --> 01:54:09.958
Queenie!

01:54:27.609 --> 01:54:29.442
Mr. Scamander.

01:54:29.444 --> 01:54:33.882
Do you think Dumbledore
will mourn for you?

01:54:43.825 --> 01:54:45.994
Grindelwald! Stop!

01:54:53.401 --> 01:54:54.669
Leta...

01:55:05.012 --> 01:55:07.648
This one I believe I know.

01:55:08.414 --> 01:55:11.350
Leta Lestrange.

01:55:11.352 --> 01:55:13.985
Despised entirely
amongst wizards,

01:55:13.987 --> 01:55:16.924
unloved, mistreated,

01:55:18.392 --> 01:55:22.664
yet brave, so very brave.

01:55:27.569 --> 01:55:29.471
Time to come home.

01:55:47.387 --> 01:55:48.889
I love you.

01:55:57.999 --> 01:55:59.067
Go!

01:56:00.066 --> 01:56:01.302
Go!

01:56:24.926 --> 01:56:26.660
I hate Paris.

01:57:06.333 --> 01:57:07.565
Together, in a circle.

01:57:07.567 --> 01:57:10.034
Your wand into the earth.

01:57:10.036 --> 01:57:12.606
Or all Paris
will be destroyed.

01:57:19.379 --> 01:57:20.981
<i>Finite!</i>

01:57:22.816 --> 01:57:23.817
<i>Finite!</i>

01:57:24.252 --> 01:57:25.453
<i>Finite!</i>

01:57:26.754 --> 01:57:27.788
<i>Finite!</i>

01:59:37.418 --> 01:59:39.286
I've chosen my side.

01:59:57.605 --> 01:59:58.973
Oh.

02:00:00.473 --> 02:00:02.375
Come here.

02:00:02.377 --> 02:00:04.978
I've got you. I've got you.

02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:52.226
I think it's best
if he speaks to him alone.

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.262
Is he frightened of me still?

02:01:29.664 --> 02:01:32.198
You need to be careful.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.769
He's not sure
he made the right choice.

02:01:35.902 --> 02:01:39.106
<i>Be very gentle with him.</i>

02:01:44.512 --> 02:01:46.880
I have a gift for you, my boy.

02:01:58.859 --> 02:02:00.395
<i>Is it true?</i>

02:02:01.361 --> 02:02:02.730
About Leta?

02:02:04.164 --> 02:02:05.166
Yes.

02:02:07.767 --> 02:02:09.436
I'm so sorry.

02:02:15.977 --> 02:02:18.312
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

02:02:20.847 --> 02:02:24.349
You swore not to
fight each other.

02:02:30.458 --> 02:02:34.094
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get...

02:02:37.330 --> 02:02:39.331
Grindelwald doesn't seem
to understand

02:02:39.333 --> 02:02:42.070
the nature of the things
he considers simple.

02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:59.551
Can you destroy it?

02:02:59.553 --> 02:03:00.954
Maybe.

02:03:03.090 --> 02:03:04.292
Maybe.

02:03:10.197 --> 02:03:12.299
Would he like a cup of tea?

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.835
He'll have some milk.

02:03:16.969 --> 02:03:18.972
Hide the teaspoons.

02:03:24.511 --> 02:03:30.716
<i>You have suffered
the most heinous of betrayals,</i>

02:03:30.718 --> 02:03:33.318
most purposely
bestowed upon you

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:37.555
by your own blood.
Your own flesh and blood.

02:03:37.557 --> 02:03:40.962
And just as he has
celebrated your torment,

02:03:42.963 --> 02:03:47.201
your brother seeks
to destroy you.

02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.354
There is a legend
in your family

02:04:09.356 --> 02:04:11.689
that a phoenix
will come to any member

02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:13.460
who is in dire need.

02:04:20.935 --> 02:04:23.370
It is your birthright, my boy.

02:04:27.642 --> 02:04:28.943
As is

02:04:30.244 --> 02:04:32.980
the name I now restore to you.

02:04:35.583 --> 02:04:37.285
Aurelius.

02:04:38.485 --> 02:04:41.322
Aurelius Dumbledore.

02:04:42.889 --> 02:04:44.890
We will go down
in history together

02:04:44.892 --> 02:04:48.095
as we remake this world.
