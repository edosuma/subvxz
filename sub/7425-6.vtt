<i>Previously, on</i>
<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:02.351 --> 00:03.817
(gunfire)

00:06.955 --> 00:07.921
CATHERINE:
Vincent!

00:07.955 --> 00:09.490
Don't shoot!

00:09.524 --> 00:10.757
She's my daughter.

00:12.059 --> 00:13.093
CATHERINE:
Come on, damn it.

00:13.127 --> 00:14.227
I need you alive.

00:15.663 --> 00:17.130
(gasps)
(monitor beeping)

00:17.164 --> 00:19.032
All I know is that
this worked once.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.767
Yeah, but you had
to die first.

00:20.802 --> 00:22.135
The beast in me
had to die,

00:22.169 --> 00:23.804
which allowed you
to save my human side.

00:23.838 --> 00:25.606
<i>Muirfield weaponized people.</i>

00:25.640 --> 00:28.008
<i>That's what</i>
<i>that organization was about.</i>

00:28.042 --> 00:29.482
Vincent did say
they wiped his memory

00:29.510 --> 00:31.011
to make him a better soldier.

00:31.045 --> 00:32.778
Look, I know
they're just flashes,

00:32.813 --> 00:36.349
but... I do, Catherine,
I remember you.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.152
These memories, they just keep
coming and coming.

00:39.186 --> 00:40.953
REYNOLDS (distorted)
We're almost there.

00:40.988 --> 00:43.028
Just a couple more Muirfield
experiments to take out

00:43.056 --> 00:44.490
and then you're done.

00:44.525 --> 00:46.225
I've been trying to help
Detective Chandler

00:46.259 --> 00:47.292
find her birth father.

00:47.327 --> 00:50.262
Ms. Chandler...
I'm Bob Reynolds.

00:53.099 --> 00:55.300
Why is Agent Reynolds
at my graduation?

00:56.937 --> 00:58.704
I think I just found
my birth father.

01:01.274 --> 01:06.378
(heart beating)

01:17.089 --> 01:19.123
(fog horn blares)

01:20.426 --> 01:22.360
(fog horn blares,
Vincent gasps)

01:29.435 --> 01:31.402
(laughs)

01:31.437 --> 01:33.837
♪ You got it wrong,
but I love you ♪

01:33.872 --> 01:36.907
♪ You're kind of rough,
but I love you ♪

01:36.942 --> 01:39.077
♪ We get along
and I love you... ♪

01:39.111 --> 01:42.046
(grunting)

01:42.081 --> 01:43.047
Nice kick.

01:43.082 --> 01:45.349
I hope that's not me

01:45.384 --> 01:47.085
you're taking it out on.
No, lucky for you

01:47.119 --> 01:49.019
there is a new man in my life
who is driving me crazy.

01:49.054 --> 01:50.254
Can I have my leg
back, please?

01:50.288 --> 01:51.855
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.057
Your dad?

01:53.091 --> 01:56.193
Okay, Agent Reynolds
is not my dad.

01:56.227 --> 01:58.128
He is my biological father.

01:58.162 --> 01:59.229
There is a difference.

01:59.263 --> 02:01.131
(grunting)

02:01.165 --> 02:03.701
Okay, so does he know
that you know?

02:03.735 --> 02:06.236
No, and I'm not sure
I'm gonna tell him.

02:06.270 --> 02:08.871
I mean, I am a grown woman.

02:08.906 --> 02:10.740
Life goes on.

02:10.774 --> 02:12.242
Besides, there are other things

02:12.276 --> 02:14.444
that I need to worry about.

02:14.479 --> 02:16.580
Rotate your hip,
you'll have more force.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.814
(sighs)

02:17.848 --> 02:19.616
Come on, try it on me.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.950
It's okay. It's fine.

02:22.686 --> 02:24.754
Better.

02:24.788 --> 02:26.122
Come on.
I'm just saying,

02:26.156 --> 02:27.556
maybe I should leave

02:27.591 --> 02:29.125
well enough alone,
you know?

02:29.159 --> 02:31.427
I mean, if he really
wanted a relationship,

02:31.461 --> 02:33.496
he wouldn't be
lurking around.

02:33.530 --> 02:36.298
He would be honest,
tell me who he really is.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.134
He'd explain why

02:38.168 --> 02:39.968
he has never wanted
to be a part of my life.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.671
(exhales)
Oh.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.673
I'm sorry...
okay, are you okay?

02:44.707 --> 02:45.674
I'm fine.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.143
Nice... nice rotation.

02:47.177 --> 02:48.277
I'll get you ice.
No.

02:48.311 --> 02:49.278
I'm-I'm good.

02:49.312 --> 02:50.412
I'm good.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.848
In fact, uh...

02:52.882 --> 02:54.116
I couldn't be better.

02:54.151 --> 02:56.417
(laughs)
I am sweaty.

02:56.452 --> 02:58.987
I know, but did we...

02:59.022 --> 03:02.323
ever celebrate something
special on your rooftop?

03:02.358 --> 03:04.660
Our anniversary?

03:04.694 --> 03:06.194
Yeah, but...
Okay, did we kiss

03:06.228 --> 03:07.763
at a ball or something?

03:07.797 --> 03:09.164
I mean, did I ever
wear a tux?

03:09.198 --> 03:10.165
Yes.

03:10.199 --> 03:12.099
I, uh, pull you out

03:12.134 --> 03:13.334
of some wrecked car?

03:13.369 --> 03:15.370
Held hands
in the subway...?

03:15.404 --> 03:16.638
You're getting
your memories back.

03:16.672 --> 03:18.139
Our memories.

03:18.174 --> 03:19.207
Good, because at first

03:19.241 --> 03:20.542
I thought they were
just dreams,

03:20.576 --> 03:22.009
and then I knew it had
to be more than that.

03:22.044 --> 03:24.345
I wanted to make sure.

03:27.149 --> 03:29.449
Now I'm really sorry
that I kicked you.

03:29.484 --> 03:30.985
(laughing):
It's fine.

03:31.019 --> 03:32.219
You know what?

03:32.253 --> 03:35.489
I have some
even better news.

03:35.523 --> 03:37.792
I just spoke
to my contact,

03:37.826 --> 03:39.193
and he says that

03:39.227 --> 03:40.895
I only have two more
missions left,

03:40.929 --> 03:42.797
and then I am done;
I am free.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.864
Wait, really?
Yeah.

03:44.899 --> 03:46.833
And you know what we're
gonna do to celebrate?

03:46.867 --> 03:48.902
We are gonna go away,
just the two of us,

03:48.936 --> 03:50.837
to Cedar Woods,

03:50.871 --> 03:52.972
under the stars,

03:53.007 --> 03:54.474
a bottle of wine,
nobody around...

03:54.509 --> 03:56.810
What's wrong?

03:56.844 --> 03:59.546
But you still have to
kill two people, right?

03:59.581 --> 04:01.480
Two beasts.

04:01.515 --> 04:03.817
Who are still people.

04:03.851 --> 04:05.585
Vincent, I get it.

04:05.619 --> 04:07.220
I do.

04:07.254 --> 04:08.487
The beasts that you've
taken out already,

04:08.522 --> 04:09.723
they're bad,

04:09.757 --> 04:11.925
they were hurting
innocent people.

04:11.959 --> 04:13.426
But I'm also a cop.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.494
It's hard for me
to get excited

04:15.529 --> 04:17.697
about you being judge, jury

04:17.731 --> 04:20.766
and executioner
all the time.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.201
Doesn't it bother you?

04:22.236 --> 04:24.270
More than before, yeah.

04:24.304 --> 04:27.240
That's because you're
getting your humanity back,

04:27.274 --> 04:29.908
I hope,
and if that's true,

04:29.943 --> 04:31.844
then that really is
something to celebrate.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.679
And we will.

04:33.714 --> 04:35.614
Okay?
We will, I promise.

04:35.648 --> 04:37.116
As soon as
I finish these missions,

04:37.150 --> 04:38.884
and as soon as you
talk to your father.

04:38.918 --> 04:40.452
After all,

04:40.486 --> 04:42.246
you went looking for him
for a reason, right?

04:43.823 --> 04:45.090
(siren whoops)

04:51.430 --> 04:52.631
TESS:
Wow.

04:52.665 --> 04:54.232
Obsess much?

04:54.267 --> 04:55.700
Close the door.

04:55.735 --> 04:56.934
Catherine just called.

04:56.969 --> 04:59.771
Said Vincent only has
two missions left.

04:59.805 --> 05:00.872
That's not a good thing?

05:00.906 --> 05:02.140
No, it's a bad thing.

05:02.174 --> 05:03.775
JT just dropped off
all of his old

05:03.809 --> 05:06.043
Muirfield research before
he left for his retreat.

05:06.078 --> 05:07.478
I need you to
cross-reference them

05:07.512 --> 05:09.947
with all of the research
I did when I was a beast.

05:09.982 --> 05:11.048
See if any of
the names match.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.216
What are we
looking for?

05:12.251 --> 05:14.118
Vincent's handler.

05:14.153 --> 05:15.386
Whoever is sending him

05:15.420 --> 05:17.121
on these missions
is somehow able

05:17.156 --> 05:18.823
to identify which beasts
are out there.

05:18.857 --> 05:22.160
He must've had knowledge
of Muirfield experiments.

05:22.194 --> 05:24.795
I'm sorry, I'm still
not clear as to why

05:24.829 --> 05:26.463
it's bad that he only
has two missions.

05:26.498 --> 05:27.998
Because if I'm right,

05:28.032 --> 05:30.066
the last mission could
very well be Vincent.

05:30.101 --> 05:33.404
Look, he was clearly
tasked with cleaning up

05:33.438 --> 05:35.306
Muirfield's loose ends
so far, right?

05:35.340 --> 05:36.573
Eliminate every beast.

05:36.608 --> 05:38.008
Including Vincent.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.109
Exactly.

05:39.143 --> 05:41.311
Did you tell Cat?

05:41.345 --> 05:43.346
She's got enough to worry about
without thinking about this.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.081
I suppose that also means

05:45.116 --> 05:46.596
you haven't told her
you like her yet,

05:46.617 --> 05:48.919
either, right?

05:50.321 --> 05:52.255
What? I'm sorry,
it's the big fat

05:52.290 --> 05:54.090
elephant in the room.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.293
I mean, why don't
you just tell Cat?

05:56.327 --> 05:57.927
You know, especially if this
whole Vincent thing blows up,

05:57.961 --> 05:59.962
she might need to know
that you're there for her.

05:59.996 --> 06:02.164
If it blows up,

06:02.199 --> 06:03.466
I will deal with it then,

06:03.500 --> 06:04.667
all right?

06:04.702 --> 06:05.935
But right now,

06:05.969 --> 06:07.437
all that matters
is I do everything I can

06:07.471 --> 06:09.872
to save Vincent...
for her.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.441
That's very honorable.

06:11.475 --> 06:13.175
It sucks, but it's honorable.

06:16.479 --> 06:17.679
(phone ringing)
VINCENT: <i>Condor.</i>

06:17.714 --> 06:19.215
REYNOLDS (distorted):
You alone?

06:19.249 --> 06:20.850
Yes, sir, I am.

06:20.884 --> 06:22.651
I don't have as much intel
as I'd like,

06:22.685 --> 06:24.286
but you only have a small
window, so we have to move.

06:24.321 --> 06:25.487
Target's name is Curt Windsor.

06:25.521 --> 06:26.722
Windsor?

06:26.756 --> 06:28.290
That's the problem.

06:28.325 --> 06:29.691
It's like taking down
Trump or Bloomberg--

06:29.726 --> 06:31.059
people tend to notice.

06:31.093 --> 06:32.060
Are you sure he's a beast?

06:32.094 --> 06:33.562
First generation.

06:33.596 --> 06:35.530
Invested in Muirfield
28 years ago,

06:35.565 --> 06:37.666
volunteered for
the first experiments--

06:37.700 --> 06:39.835
we think because
he wanted to get even

06:39.869 --> 06:41.002
with a rival, take him out.

06:41.036 --> 06:42.203
Instead, the strain

06:42.238 --> 06:43.805
lay dormant in his system

06:43.840 --> 06:45.907
until three years ago.
That's when a lot of

06:45.941 --> 06:47.675
his rivals started dying,
viciously.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.810
Okay, so why three years ago?

06:49.845 --> 06:51.045
What triggered it?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.580
I don't know,

06:52.614 --> 06:54.048
but he's only been
getting more paranoid

06:54.083 --> 06:55.316
since his ex-wife died,

06:55.351 --> 06:57.018
especially about
his daughter, Tori.

06:57.052 --> 06:58.386
They're always
surrounded by bodyguards.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.221
But every night at 0100,

07:00.256 --> 07:02.556
Tori turns off the alarm,
sneaks out onto the balcony.

07:02.591 --> 07:03.824
That's your in.

07:03.859 --> 07:05.593
0100-- okay, I got it.

07:05.627 --> 07:07.361
No messing around, Keller.

07:07.396 --> 07:10.364
He's too high-profile,
there are too many unknowns,

07:10.399 --> 07:12.032
especially when it comes
to his powers.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.567
Get in, eliminate him,

07:13.602 --> 07:14.835
get out.

07:14.870 --> 07:16.704
Understood. And, sir...

07:18.440 --> 07:20.480
...after this, there's just
one more mission, right?

07:26.147 --> 07:27.514
Sir?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.049
Correct.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.954
Detective Chandler...

07:33.988 --> 07:35.755
to what do I owe
the pleasure?

07:37.458 --> 07:39.358
Detective Chandler?

07:39.393 --> 07:41.628
I'm sorry.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.896
(laughs)

07:42.930 --> 07:44.798
Sorry, I am late for work,

07:44.832 --> 07:47.233
uh, but I was hoping
that we could

07:47.267 --> 07:49.969
meet tomorrow for coffee,

07:50.003 --> 07:52.471
or-or something, so we can,

07:52.505 --> 07:54.106
you know, talk.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.975
About?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.929
About why you've been
hiding the truth from me...

07:59.679 --> 08:01.113
...Dad.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.220
Yeah.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.792
Thank you.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.104
(distant siren wails)

08:32.378 --> 08:34.879
(horns honking faintly)

08:56.201 --> 08:58.268
(heart beating)

09:01.706 --> 09:03.974
(heartbeat grows louder)

09:07.312 --> 09:08.379
(groans)

09:08.413 --> 09:09.380
Who are you?

09:09.414 --> 09:11.048
How'd you get in?

09:11.082 --> 09:13.484
(growling)

09:16.186 --> 09:17.453
(grunts)

09:19.189 --> 09:20.056
(groans)

09:20.090 --> 09:21.558
(Tori gasps)

09:21.592 --> 09:23.459
Tori!
Daddy?

09:23.494 --> 09:24.694
(growls)

09:24.729 --> 09:25.695
You let him in?!

09:38.442 --> 09:40.443
Help, somebody, please help...

10:10.924 --> 10:12.357
So, you come here often?

10:13.726 --> 10:14.927
Yeah, uh, I live
around the corner.

10:14.961 --> 10:16.261
Alone?

10:16.296 --> 10:18.030
I'm surprised
you don't know,

10:18.064 --> 10:19.764
considering you've obviously
been hiding in plain sight

10:19.799 --> 10:21.400
this entire time.

10:22.936 --> 10:24.201
Why didn't you just...

10:24.236 --> 10:26.270
come right out and
tell me who you were?

10:26.305 --> 10:29.908
I wanted to, but...

10:29.942 --> 10:31.776
especially last month,
at Thomas's tribute,

10:31.811 --> 10:33.177
but I also
didn't want to...

10:33.211 --> 10:34.579
complicate your life.

10:34.613 --> 10:36.781
I figured if you
wanted to find me,

10:36.816 --> 10:38.215
you would, and you did.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.617
And I'm glad you did.

10:40.652 --> 10:42.086
Still, it never
stopped me from...

10:42.120 --> 10:44.388
From what?

10:44.423 --> 10:45.957
From, you know,
keeping an eye on you

10:45.991 --> 10:47.091
every once in a while.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.625
Making sure
you were okay.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.094
By, uh, spying on me?

10:50.128 --> 10:51.462
I wasn't spying on you.

10:51.496 --> 10:53.965
I honored your privacy

10:53.999 --> 10:56.533
exactly the way your
mother asked me to.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.035
But high school
graduation, college...

10:59.070 --> 11:01.271
Nah, I couldn't
miss that.

11:01.305 --> 11:03.161
So what are you saying...

11:03.162 --> 11:05.119
my mom told you
to stay away from me?

11:05.120 --> 11:07.676
Look, I am not going
to disparage your mother.

11:07.857 --> 11:09.818
Good, then don't.

11:09.885 --> 11:11.318
Vanessa had her own reasons

11:11.352 --> 11:13.520
for not telling you about me,

11:13.555 --> 11:16.323
mostly to protect
your relationship with Thomas.

11:17.958 --> 11:20.527
Look, we were young when we met,
fell madly in love.

11:20.562 --> 11:24.931
She was at a biotech firm,
I was the FBI liaison.

11:24.965 --> 11:27.201
So you had a fling and had me.

11:27.235 --> 11:30.571
It was more than just a fling.

11:30.605 --> 11:32.573
But we didn't know
she was pregnant

11:32.607 --> 11:34.107
until after we broke up.

11:34.141 --> 11:37.077
By then, she'd met Thomas.

11:37.111 --> 11:38.377
He adopted you,

11:38.412 --> 11:39.579
and they asked me
to honor that.

11:39.613 --> 11:41.081
You didn't fight it?

11:41.115 --> 11:42.515
I felt like that there was

11:42.549 --> 11:44.217
enough fighting going on
between your mother

11:44.251 --> 11:47.286
and I at the time, and I told
Vanessa that when you turned 18,

11:47.321 --> 11:49.689
I was coming back
into your life, but...

11:49.723 --> 11:52.758
And then she died.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.860
And I didn't want
to make it look like

11:54.894 --> 11:57.530
I was trying to take
advantage of that, so...

11:57.564 --> 11:59.565
So here we are.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.801
But I want you to know
that I'm here for you now.

12:02.836 --> 12:04.704
And you can ask me
anything you want.

12:04.738 --> 12:07.572
What do you know
about Muirfield?

12:07.607 --> 12:11.376
I know that's who your mother
was working for when I met her.

12:13.512 --> 12:15.680
I also know they're the ones
who killed her.

12:18.651 --> 12:19.952
Anything else?

12:19.986 --> 12:21.920
No.

12:21.955 --> 12:23.722
I'm sorry.

12:25.124 --> 12:26.524
(phone buzzes)

12:34.300 --> 12:35.634
I have to go.
I gotta go.

12:35.668 --> 12:37.769
Duty calls.

12:37.803 --> 12:40.571
You know, I don't want
to push myself on you,

12:40.605 --> 12:43.241
so you tell me if you want
to meet again, okay?

12:43.275 --> 12:45.409
Okay. Thank you.

12:45.443 --> 12:47.611
Okay.

12:47.646 --> 12:49.814
You know,
I'm the only one

12:49.848 --> 12:51.115
who can fill in
the blanks,

12:51.150 --> 12:53.651
I mean, you know,
about your past.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.986
And if you let me,
maybe you won't make

12:56.020 --> 12:57.688
the same mistake
your mother did

12:57.722 --> 12:59.590
and fall in love
with a lost cause.

13:04.629 --> 13:06.430
(phone rings)

13:08.866 --> 13:10.401
What the hell happened?

13:12.403 --> 13:14.271
I'll tell you what happened.

13:14.305 --> 13:17.674
Windsor is far more powerful
than you made him out to be.

13:17.708 --> 13:21.044
And with all due respect, sir,
your intel kind of sucks.

13:21.078 --> 13:22.879
That's not possible;
he's first generation.

13:22.914 --> 13:25.648
He's more than that--
he-he sensed me coming,

13:25.683 --> 13:27.650
and I barely even got out
of there.

13:27.685 --> 13:30.052
But kidnapping his daughter was
a huge mistake.

13:30.086 --> 13:31.454
It's all over the news.

13:31.488 --> 13:33.456
I didn't kidnap her.

13:33.490 --> 13:34.791
I saved her, okay?

13:34.825 --> 13:36.859
She was gonna
get hurt.

13:36.893 --> 13:38.528
His daughter? Why?

13:38.562 --> 13:40.162
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause it's

13:40.197 --> 13:42.332
the first time that she saw
that he was a beast.

13:44.568 --> 13:46.068
Did she see you, too?

13:46.102 --> 13:47.837
Yeah.

13:47.871 --> 13:50.072
This is not like you, Keller,
this is messy.

13:50.106 --> 13:51.673
What am I supposed to do

13:51.708 --> 13:54.009
with her now?
You know what? I don't know.

13:54.044 --> 13:55.544
Why do you think
I'm calling you?

13:55.578 --> 13:56.879
Based on everything we know
about Windsor,

13:56.913 --> 13:58.080
he will stop at nothing

13:58.114 --> 13:59.681
until his daughter's back
under his control.

13:59.716 --> 14:01.217
Right, which makes her leverage.

14:01.251 --> 14:03.719
But it also makes you a target.
If he sensed you once,

14:03.753 --> 14:05.420
he can do it again.

14:05.455 --> 14:07.222
You gotta get her out
of there, fast.

14:07.256 --> 14:09.491
Hide.
Okay, understood.

14:09.525 --> 14:11.560
How will you contact me?

14:11.594 --> 14:14.295
Don't worry. I'll find a way.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.569
(muffled whimpering)

14:21.603 --> 14:24.739
I'm not 100% sure
Windsor's a beast,

14:24.773 --> 14:27.075
but his name came up
as a strong possibility.

14:27.109 --> 14:28.877
Okay, but why
do we care?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.257
Because if he is a beast,
he could be one

14:30.258 --> 14:31.691
of the last two on the list.

14:31.726 --> 14:33.193
Or the last one.

14:33.228 --> 14:34.694
Point is, we're trying

14:34.729 --> 14:37.197
to figure out who
Vincent's handler is,

14:37.232 --> 14:39.566
and thought maybe Windsor might
be Vincent's next mission.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.601
Okay.

14:41.636 --> 14:43.670
But according to this,

14:43.704 --> 14:46.038
Windsor was experimented on
almost 30 years ago.

14:46.073 --> 14:47.874
If he is a beast,

14:47.908 --> 14:49.242
what took him
so long to gestate?

14:49.277 --> 14:51.010
It's a good question,
especially since

14:51.044 --> 14:53.880
that's about the same time
I was experimented on and...

14:53.914 --> 14:55.448
I reacted immediately.
Maybe it's different

14:55.483 --> 14:57.717
'cause Windsor was an adult
at the time?

14:57.752 --> 15:00.853
It's gotta be something else,
and relatively recent, too.

15:00.888 --> 15:02.255
The fact that Windsor's

15:02.289 --> 15:04.723
name popped up,
and now the kidnapping,

15:04.758 --> 15:07.295
something is going on,
and we need to figure out what.

15:10.062 --> 15:13.165
Do you know if Vincent's
on a mission now?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.362
Yeah, I think he is.

15:15.363 --> 15:17.463
Any chance you could find out
if this is it?

15:17.498 --> 15:20.033
Wait-- do you think Vincent
kidnapped Tori Windsor?

15:20.067 --> 15:22.568
Yes.
No. Look,

15:22.603 --> 15:24.504
I'm just trying to connect
some dots here,

15:24.538 --> 15:26.907
and right now, I'm not just
concerned about Vincent,

15:26.941 --> 15:28.474
I'm also concerned about Tori.

15:37.584 --> 15:39.652
Vincent?

15:57.938 --> 16:00.406
This better be Tori's.

16:40.779 --> 16:43.481
There's no sign of them.
They were here. I know it.

16:43.515 --> 16:44.928
Take anything that
might help us

16:44.929 --> 16:49.098
figure out who this guy is,
where he's got Tori.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.435
Then after we get my daughter
back, I'm gonna tear

16:52.469 --> 16:54.270
this guy to shreds.

16:58.824 --> 17:00.385
Do you have any idea
where Vincent is?

17:00.467 --> 17:02.001
No, but fortunately,
neither does Windsor.

17:02.035 --> 17:05.037
Although he does seem to
have a way of tracking him.

17:05.070 --> 17:07.372
You mean, like beast on beast?
I don't know.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.907
But something
must've gone wrong,

17:08.942 --> 17:10.709
otherwise, Vincent never
would've taken Tori.

17:10.972 --> 17:13.907
Unless he's using her as
leverage to get to Windsor.

17:13.942 --> 17:16.577
I'm just saying,
it's sound strategy.

17:16.611 --> 17:18.979
I am the last to condone
Vincent's missions,

17:19.013 --> 17:21.516
but at least it's always
been saving innocent people,

17:21.550 --> 17:22.849
and that is Tori.

17:22.884 --> 17:25.819
So, you think
he was rescuing her...

17:25.854 --> 17:27.087
from her father.

17:27.121 --> 17:28.689
Who's a beast.

17:28.723 --> 17:30.257
But still her father.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.526
Tess, I know you've been on
an anti-Vincent kick lately...

17:32.561 --> 17:35.796
No, I haven't. I just want
what's best for you.

17:35.830 --> 17:37.031
And that's still Vincent.

17:38.487 --> 17:40.092
He's getting
better, too.

17:41.035 --> 17:42.936
It's not just that he's
getting his memory back,

17:42.970 --> 17:45.638
but he's more...
I don't know, himself again.

17:46.173 --> 17:48.808
He wants this to be
over with, he wants us back.

17:48.842 --> 17:50.142
He's not a lost cause.

17:50.177 --> 17:51.310
Who said he was?

17:52.231 --> 17:54.800
GABE:
Catherine? Tess?

17:56.953 --> 17:58.547
I heard about
the houseboat.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.116
Are you all right?

18:00.150 --> 18:00.970
Sure, other than

18:00.971 --> 18:02.372
whatever drug-resistant bug

18:02.406 --> 18:04.441
I probably picked up
in the Hudson.

18:04.475 --> 18:05.908
I think Vincent's in trouble,

18:05.943 --> 18:07.711
and I think that's why
he took Tori.

18:07.745 --> 18:09.379
How many guards
did Windsor have?

18:09.413 --> 18:11.414
I don't know;
half-dozen or so.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.549
It's one thing for Vincent
to take on another beast,

18:13.583 --> 18:15.451
it's another thing for
him to take on a small army.

18:15.485 --> 18:16.986
He isn't bulletproof.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.888
What does a beast even need
armed guards for?

18:18.922 --> 18:20.589
That's just one of the many
unknowns about Windsor.

18:20.623 --> 18:21.724
He's a wild card.

18:21.758 --> 18:22.959
But we may have an ace.

18:22.993 --> 18:24.927
One that, if we find Vincent
before Windsor

18:24.962 --> 18:26.495
could save both of them.

18:26.529 --> 18:28.097
Please don't tell me you're
gonna pitch

18:28.131 --> 18:29.598
the flatlining thing again.
Actually, I am.

18:29.632 --> 18:31.900
Look, I know it didn't
work with the arsonist beast,

18:31.934 --> 18:33.335
but it worked on me, right?

18:33.370 --> 18:35.637
And since Windsor was
experimented on with

18:35.672 --> 18:38.507
the same strain I was,
it stands to reason...

18:38.541 --> 18:40.576
If it worked on you,
it might actually work on him.

18:40.610 --> 18:41.477
Exactly.
Oh, yeah.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.845
"Hey, Curt, would you mind

18:42.879 --> 18:44.312
"beasting out
so we can kill you?

18:44.347 --> 18:45.780
"And then after
you flatline,

18:45.814 --> 18:47.782
"we may or may
not be able

18:47.816 --> 18:49.617
to, you know, shock
your human side back to life?"

18:49.651 --> 18:51.186
I'm sure he'll go for that.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.788
It's the only way
to get his daughter back.

18:53.822 --> 18:56.191
Oh, so now Tori <i>is</i> leverage.

18:56.225 --> 18:59.527
If it saves everybody,
yeah, she is.

18:59.561 --> 19:01.863
God forbid we actually help
Vincent complete

19:01.897 --> 19:04.932
one of his mission without him
having to kill somebody first.

19:04.966 --> 19:06.768
But I have to find him.

19:06.802 --> 19:09.003
How are you gonna do that?

19:09.037 --> 19:11.773
Figure out how
Windsor's trying to do it.

19:13.642 --> 19:15.142
TORI:
Help!

19:15.176 --> 19:17.478
Somebody hear me?!

19:17.513 --> 19:18.845
Anybody?

19:21.582 --> 19:23.117
You're wasting
your breath.

19:24.986 --> 19:26.686
There's no one
around for miles.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.125
I thought you left me.

19:31.159 --> 19:33.360
Why would I save you
just to leave you?

19:33.395 --> 19:37.297
You didn't save me, you
kidnapped me from my father.

19:37.331 --> 19:39.999
You know what?
Let me ask you a question.

19:41.602 --> 19:43.336
Is that the first time

19:43.370 --> 19:45.171
that you've seen your father
change like that?

19:47.942 --> 19:49.409
From the way that you reacted,

19:49.444 --> 19:51.744
I would say that was the first,
am I right?

19:51.778 --> 19:54.480
Please don't hurt me.

19:54.514 --> 19:57.183
Tori, why would I hurt you?

19:57.217 --> 19:59.385
Because I saw you, too.

20:00.955 --> 20:04.157
I don't, I don't understand.

20:04.191 --> 20:07.893
You won't...

20:07.928 --> 20:09.562
at least not at first.

20:09.596 --> 20:10.830
Look, trust me.

20:10.864 --> 20:12.598
I didn't find it easy
either, okay?

20:12.632 --> 20:14.266
I still don't.

20:14.300 --> 20:18.070
But understand this:
I am nothing like your father.

20:18.104 --> 20:21.406
He killed innocent people
for money and power.

20:21.441 --> 20:24.542
That is why he is targeted.

20:24.577 --> 20:25.844
You should be thanking me.

20:25.878 --> 20:27.112
Thanking you?

20:27.146 --> 20:28.680
For what?

20:28.714 --> 20:30.615
For getting you
away from him,

20:30.649 --> 20:32.250
from the way that he treats you.

20:32.285 --> 20:34.219
He treats me fine!

20:34.253 --> 20:36.554
He takes care of me,
protects me.

20:36.589 --> 20:37.689
No, he cages you.

20:37.723 --> 20:39.958
Let me guess:
He doesn't let you

20:39.993 --> 20:42.059
out of his sight, right?

20:42.094 --> 20:44.228
You know, he would've
choked you to death

20:44.262 --> 20:45.697
if I hadn't have stopped him.

20:45.731 --> 20:48.032
What are you doing?

20:48.066 --> 20:51.469
Making sure
I'm ready this time...

20:51.504 --> 20:52.904
if he comes looking for you.

20:52.938 --> 20:55.206
What are you?

21:00.278 --> 21:02.813
Look, Tori,
I didn't ask for this

21:02.847 --> 21:04.448
to happen to me, okay?

21:04.483 --> 21:07.485
But your father,
he did.

21:07.519 --> 21:08.719
He wanted this,

21:08.753 --> 21:10.587
but now he's out of control

21:10.622 --> 21:12.356
and he needs to be stopped.

21:18.029 --> 21:19.963
All right,
listen to me.

21:19.998 --> 21:22.799
He's not just hurting
other people, okay?

21:22.834 --> 21:24.100
He is hurting you, too,

21:24.135 --> 21:26.970
and I know that
you know it.

21:27.005 --> 21:29.640
He may have hidden his face,
but obviously

21:29.674 --> 21:31.274
not his heart, huh?

21:31.308 --> 21:34.277
I can prove it...
if you'll let me.

21:34.311 --> 21:36.279
Right now.

21:44.555 --> 21:47.456
You gotta trust me, okay?

22:01.872 --> 22:04.173
It might sting a little bit.

22:06.042 --> 22:07.676
(low groan)

22:10.846 --> 22:12.814
(groaning)

22:17.053 --> 22:18.954
(quietly):
What...?

22:18.988 --> 22:20.455
What is that?

22:20.489 --> 22:22.023
It's a tracking device.

22:22.058 --> 22:24.825
You had surgery lately?

22:24.859 --> 22:28.329
Your father would've
had it put in then.

22:28.363 --> 22:30.331
But why?

22:30.365 --> 22:31.732
I don't know.

22:31.766 --> 22:33.167
He's got a lot of enemies.

22:33.202 --> 22:35.069
From all accounts,

22:35.104 --> 22:38.772
your father's gotten a
little paranoid lately.

22:40.075 --> 22:43.343
Tori, people like... us,

22:43.377 --> 22:45.145
we either get better or worse.

22:46.414 --> 22:48.015
No status quo.

22:48.049 --> 22:51.051
But how did you know?

22:51.086 --> 22:52.219
'Cause I heard it transmitting.

22:52.253 --> 22:53.988
It's nice and quiet out here.

22:54.022 --> 22:55.555
But you didn't take it out
until just now.

22:55.590 --> 22:57.924
No.

22:57.958 --> 23:00.860
Because I want
your father to find you.

23:02.730 --> 23:04.397
So I can kill him.

23:08.302 --> 23:09.469
(car alarm chirps)

23:11.038 --> 23:13.205
REYNOLDS:
Catherine!

23:13.240 --> 23:15.074
Hi!

23:15.109 --> 23:16.575
Catherine...

23:16.610 --> 23:18.077
I-I'm sorry,
do you still want me

23:18.112 --> 23:19.278
to call you
Detective Chandler?

23:19.312 --> 23:20.312
No, uh, Catherine's fine.

23:20.313 --> 23:21.714
What are you doing here?

23:21.749 --> 23:23.616
I was about to ask you
the same question.

23:23.651 --> 23:25.551
Uh, Tori's still missing.
It's my jurisdiction.

23:25.585 --> 23:27.020
Thought I'd help out
if that's okay.

23:27.054 --> 23:29.388
Absolutely. I-I was just
waiting for, uh, Windsor

23:29.422 --> 23:31.089
to come down, maybe
catch him off guard.

23:31.124 --> 23:33.192
But why don't we go up there
and talk to him together?

23:33.226 --> 23:34.926
What do you mean
"catch him off guard"?

23:34.961 --> 23:36.629
I don't know, I've been
doing this a long time.

23:36.663 --> 23:37.963
There's something that
just doesn't feel right

23:37.997 --> 23:39.298
about the guy, I guess.

23:39.332 --> 23:40.599
I-I can't quite put
my finger on it.

23:40.634 --> 23:42.268
Because he's not asking
for FBI help?

23:42.302 --> 23:43.969
Partly, yeah.

23:44.003 --> 23:46.138
Partly 'cause every bone
in my body is telling me

23:46.172 --> 23:48.073
he's a bad guy,
and I don't trust him.

23:48.107 --> 23:49.975
The only thing that matters
right now is finding Tori,

23:50.009 --> 23:51.810
and catching whoever's
responsible, right?

23:51.844 --> 23:53.111
That's why I'm here.

23:53.146 --> 23:55.213
Great.
Well, let's team up.

23:55.247 --> 23:57.082
See if Windsor's
hiding something.

23:57.116 --> 23:58.449
Maybe we can appeal to
him as father/daughter.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.652
Maybe we should just stick

24:00.687 --> 24:01.787
to good cop/bad cop

24:01.821 --> 24:04.589
for now if that's okay.

24:06.192 --> 24:08.125
Mr. Windsor in?

24:12.298 --> 24:15.099
How much money is
too much money?

24:15.133 --> 24:16.601
Well, when you're
constantly paranoid

24:16.635 --> 24:18.836
that you're gonna lose
your daughter...

24:18.870 --> 24:20.104
Speaking of boyfriends.

24:20.138 --> 24:21.972
Who was speaking
about boyfriends?

24:22.007 --> 24:23.507
I was just about to.

24:23.541 --> 24:24.775
Am I allowed to ask
if you have one?

24:24.810 --> 24:26.577
I do.

24:26.611 --> 24:28.512
Is he good to you?

24:28.546 --> 24:30.581
Yes, he is. Very good.

24:30.615 --> 24:31.582
And do you trust him?

24:31.616 --> 24:32.516
I'm sorry...

24:32.550 --> 24:33.684
I'm not allowed to ask.

24:33.719 --> 24:35.819
I know.

24:35.853 --> 24:37.954
It's just, um,

24:37.988 --> 24:39.623
I hope he makes you happy.

24:39.657 --> 24:42.959
And that you can always count
on him to be there for you.

24:42.993 --> 24:45.161
WINDSOR:
Can I help you?

24:45.196 --> 24:46.463
Mr. Windsor.

24:46.497 --> 24:48.665
I'm Agent Reynolds of the FBI.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.100
This is Detective Chandler.

24:50.134 --> 24:51.602
I know who you are.

24:51.636 --> 24:52.635
And as I told the other agents,

24:52.669 --> 24:53.636
I don't need your help.

24:53.670 --> 24:55.205
I can find Tori on my own.

24:55.239 --> 24:56.339
How?
Let's just say

24:56.373 --> 24:57.673
I prefer private security

24:57.708 --> 24:58.708
over government.

24:58.743 --> 25:00.043
Mr. Windsor, you're aware

25:00.077 --> 25:01.044
that kidnapping's
a crime, right?

25:01.078 --> 25:02.378
Which is why we're here.

25:02.412 --> 25:03.813
So if you have
any information...

25:03.848 --> 25:05.014
You people.

25:05.049 --> 25:06.116
You've been after me for years.

25:06.150 --> 25:07.183
Trying to tear me down,

25:07.218 --> 25:08.684
prove I'm some sort of criminal.

25:08.719 --> 25:09.785
Look, Mr. Windsor.

25:09.819 --> 25:11.120
I don't give a crap

25:11.154 --> 25:12.187
how you made your millions.

25:12.222 --> 25:13.322
You can keep them.

25:13.357 --> 25:14.457
The only thing I care about

25:14.491 --> 25:15.558
is getting your daughter back

25:15.592 --> 25:16.559
because that's all that matters.

25:16.593 --> 25:18.327
Do you understand that?

25:18.362 --> 25:20.796
Now, I can run you downtown
for obstruction of justice

25:20.830 --> 25:22.498
if I want to,
so if I were you,

25:22.532 --> 25:24.567
I'd start cooperating.
WINDSOR: Or, I can make

25:24.601 --> 25:26.501
one phone call and have you
in the unemployment line.

25:26.535 --> 25:27.702
Cedar Woods.

25:27.737 --> 25:28.837
REYNOLDS:
We're your best chance

25:28.872 --> 25:29.993
of finding her, Mr. Windsor.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.173
The FBI couldn't find

25:31.207 --> 25:32.507
its nose in a mirror.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.248
I have to take this.

25:39.282 --> 25:41.616
(short laugh)

25:47.790 --> 25:49.991
Catherine, wait!

25:54.129 --> 25:56.164
I still can't believe
this is happening.

25:56.198 --> 25:59.400
My mom tried to warn me
about my dad before she died,

25:59.434 --> 26:01.769
but... I had no idea

26:01.804 --> 26:03.838
this is what she meant.

26:03.872 --> 26:05.840
How could I?

26:05.874 --> 26:07.574
You couldn't.

26:09.544 --> 26:11.679
Tori, most of us
live secret lives.

26:11.713 --> 26:13.881
We don't have a choice.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.249
Sometimes we can't
even be honest

26:16.284 --> 26:17.551
with the people closest to us.

26:21.423 --> 26:23.791
What kind of life is that?

26:23.825 --> 26:26.527
A lonely one.

26:26.561 --> 26:28.962
Unless you're lucky enough
to have someone special

26:28.996 --> 26:30.831
in your life to keep you sane.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.235
Do you have somebody like that?

26:38.505 --> 26:39.873
Yeah.

26:43.410 --> 26:45.745
Lucky you.

26:50.016 --> 26:52.452
(voice breaking):
What am I gonna do?

26:52.486 --> 26:55.287
(sighs)

26:55.322 --> 26:57.256
(crying)

26:59.626 --> 27:00.727
It'll be all right, okay?

27:16.943 --> 27:19.078
(quietly):
Go, go.

27:31.491 --> 27:32.657
(gasps)

27:40.866 --> 27:42.267
What are you doing here?

27:42.301 --> 27:44.135
Wondering what
you're doing here.

27:58.998 --> 28:01.748
They hiked back down
the trail to a car.

28:01.749 --> 28:04.718
But there were three
tracks, not just two.

28:04.752 --> 28:06.953
Somebody warned them
we were coming.

28:06.988 --> 28:08.554
He knew we were coming.

28:08.589 --> 28:11.557
And he knew how long
it would take us to find him.

28:11.592 --> 28:14.127
What do you
think he wants?

28:14.161 --> 28:16.496
He wants me.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.869
And I want my daughter back.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.474
Our friend's out of town.

28:28.509 --> 28:30.343
They won't look for you here.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.977
Maybe I should just
call my father.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.513
M-Maybe I can
just talk to him.

28:33.547 --> 28:34.913
Yeah, fine with me.

28:34.948 --> 28:36.349
Not fine with me.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.680
What's the matter with you?

28:37.681 --> 28:39.180
Do you want him
to trace that call?

28:39.205 --> 28:40.758
Yeah.
We can lure him.

28:40.759 --> 28:43.067
Catherine, why do you think
I set those traps?

28:43.068 --> 28:44.836
I had the advantage out there.

28:44.870 --> 28:47.170
Windsor wasn't coming alone,
Vincent, and you weren't

28:47.204 --> 28:49.673
trying to trap him,
you were trying to spear him.

28:49.707 --> 28:51.808
So much for getting
your humanity coming back, huh?

28:51.843 --> 28:54.711
TORI: I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

28:54.745 --> 28:55.979
CATHERINE:
No, it isn't.

28:56.013 --> 28:57.981
TORI:
Yes, it is.

28:58.015 --> 29:01.250
I should've said something,
done something a long time ago

29:01.285 --> 29:03.853
when I first... knew

29:03.887 --> 29:05.521
something wasn't right.

29:05.555 --> 29:07.890
He just, he started getting

29:07.924 --> 29:10.860
so angry... crazy angry.

29:10.894 --> 29:12.161
But then he'd apologize

29:12.196 --> 29:15.999
with gifts and clothes.

29:16.033 --> 29:17.433
Whatever I wanted,
he'd give to me.

29:17.468 --> 29:18.701
Listen to me, Tori.

29:18.735 --> 29:20.536
I know what you're
going through.

29:20.570 --> 29:22.605
I do.

29:22.639 --> 29:24.239
Maybe not about what
your dad has done.

29:24.273 --> 29:26.375
But about... beasts.

29:26.409 --> 29:27.676
I was younger than you

29:27.711 --> 29:29.712
when I first found out.

29:29.746 --> 29:32.347
When Vincent saved my life, and
I didn't believe it at first.

29:32.382 --> 29:33.716
I couldn't.

29:33.750 --> 29:34.950
And it's a lot to absorb.

29:34.985 --> 29:36.351
You feel alone.

29:36.386 --> 29:38.887
You can't talk
to anyone about it.

29:38.921 --> 29:41.589
But I'm telling you,
you can, you can talk to me.

29:41.624 --> 29:43.191
You aren't alone.

29:43.226 --> 29:44.259
Thank you.

29:44.293 --> 29:45.960
He told me
the only reason

29:45.995 --> 29:47.795
he's not as bad as my father

29:47.830 --> 29:50.165
is that he's got
someone special.

29:52.568 --> 29:53.935
That's you, right?

29:53.969 --> 29:56.037
Yeah.

29:56.071 --> 29:58.406
But it's not easy,
I'm not gonna lie.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.207
They go through a lot

30:00.242 --> 30:01.609
being the way they are.

30:01.644 --> 30:03.277
Even the good ones.

30:03.311 --> 30:04.612
But don't you worry
that he'll ever change?

30:04.647 --> 30:05.980
I mean, like my father?

30:06.015 --> 30:07.949
All the time.

30:07.983 --> 30:09.983
Okay.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.218
So, what are we gonna do?

30:11.253 --> 30:12.386
Can't just sit here all day.

30:12.421 --> 30:13.487
We need a plan.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.089
What do you have in mind?

30:15.123 --> 30:16.657
What do you think?

30:16.691 --> 30:18.171
I think we should
do everything we can

30:18.193 --> 30:19.726
to try and save her father.

30:19.761 --> 30:20.727
What?

30:20.762 --> 30:22.563
What's gotten into you?

30:22.597 --> 30:25.299
This isn't like you--
at least not lately;

30:25.333 --> 30:26.900
not before this happened.

30:26.935 --> 30:27.968
(sighs)

30:28.002 --> 30:30.737
Gabe has an idea.

30:30.772 --> 30:33.306
Oh, let me guess--
hmm... flatlining?

30:34.776 --> 30:36.877
Ah, give me a break.

30:38.145 --> 30:41.114
"Flatlining"?

30:41.148 --> 30:42.449
CATHERINE:
It's complicated.

30:42.483 --> 30:43.683
And it's not
without its risks,

30:43.684 --> 30:45.285
but for a variety of reasons,

30:45.319 --> 30:47.253
it might actually
kill the beast in your father.

30:47.288 --> 30:48.688
Catherine, he's
too far gone.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.423
Okay?
He likes being a beast.

30:50.458 --> 30:51.657
And everything
that it gives him.

30:51.692 --> 30:53.326
I don't believe that.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.161
I do.

30:55.196 --> 30:56.296
Vincent's right.

30:56.330 --> 30:59.198
He won't give up
what it gives to him.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.266
Even for you?

31:05.806 --> 31:07.439
When's the last time
you heard from her?

31:07.474 --> 31:09.041
Sorry, are you asking
as a special agent

31:09.076 --> 31:10.710
or as a concerned father?
Both.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.979
Did you know she was
going to see Windsor?

31:13.013 --> 31:14.947
How do you know
she was going there?

31:14.982 --> 31:16.215
Because I was there, too.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.882
We were interviewing
him together,

31:17.917 --> 31:19.651
all of a sudden,
she takes off,

31:19.685 --> 31:21.220
and nobody's heard
from her since.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.122
She didn't say
where she was going?

31:23.156 --> 31:26.024
Obviously not, or I
wouldn't be here, would I?

31:26.058 --> 31:27.792
Look...

31:27.827 --> 31:29.961
I'm sorry; I know you
care about Catherine.

31:29.996 --> 31:31.163
I do.

31:31.197 --> 31:33.732
I'm worried about her.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.300
And I don't trust Windsor,
and I don't like

31:36.335 --> 31:38.202
not being in control
of a situation.

31:38.237 --> 31:40.005
(phone buzzes)
Neither does your daughter.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.975
Look, I got to go.

31:44.010 --> 31:46.210
But I will call you
if I hear anything, I promise.

31:46.245 --> 31:47.879
Okay? And don't worry.
If I know Catherine,

31:47.913 --> 31:50.214
she's perfectly in control.

31:50.249 --> 31:51.682
(wry laugh)

32:01.360 --> 32:03.494
How bad do you want
your daughter back?

32:08.181 --> 32:11.484
You either very brave,
or very stupid.

32:11.518 --> 32:13.318
Well, I'm not stupid.

32:13.353 --> 32:17.490
Okay, I'll play along.

32:17.524 --> 32:19.291
What are you offering?

32:19.325 --> 32:20.526
I already told you.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.827
Tori.

32:21.862 --> 32:23.828
In exchange for what?
The beast in you.

32:23.863 --> 32:24.963
I'm sorry, the what?

32:24.998 --> 32:26.365
Don't waste my time.

32:26.399 --> 32:28.467
I'm in a hurry and so are you.

32:28.501 --> 32:31.470
I know who you really are.
Or, rather, <i>what</i> you are.

32:31.504 --> 32:32.704
And I'm giving you

32:32.738 --> 32:33.972
exactly two minutes to decide

32:34.007 --> 32:35.307
what's more important to you,

32:35.341 --> 32:38.410
your daughter...
or staying a beast.

32:41.013 --> 32:42.847
You're working with
the other one, aren't you?

32:42.882 --> 32:45.650
The one who
kidnapped Tori.

32:45.684 --> 32:47.519
Rescued her, actually.

32:47.553 --> 32:48.786
From you.

32:48.821 --> 32:50.021
Is that right?

32:50.055 --> 32:51.689
Yeah.
And even though she knows

32:51.724 --> 32:55.159
what you really are now,
she's willing to come back.

32:55.193 --> 32:57.161
Under one condition.

32:58.263 --> 33:00.864
I give it all up.

33:00.899 --> 33:02.299
Yup.

33:02.334 --> 33:03.501
Humor me.

33:03.535 --> 33:05.236
How would that work, exactly?

33:05.270 --> 33:06.404
You'd have to die.

33:06.438 --> 33:07.871
Your beast, anyway.

33:07.906 --> 33:10.741
And once you were dead,
we paddle your corpse,

33:10.775 --> 33:12.543
try and restart
your human heart.

33:12.577 --> 33:14.144
Probably won't work,

33:14.178 --> 33:16.379
but what other option
do you have, really?

33:16.414 --> 33:18.348
Hmm.

33:21.252 --> 33:24.054
I could kill you.

33:24.088 --> 33:27.824
You would never get
to see Tori again.

33:27.859 --> 33:30.560
Ever.

33:30.594 --> 33:34.497
And we both know
how much she means to you.

33:34.532 --> 33:36.032
One minute.

33:36.067 --> 33:38.068
I don't need a minute.

33:38.102 --> 33:39.669
The answer's no.

33:39.703 --> 33:41.171
I can find Tori myself.

33:41.205 --> 33:42.605
Fine. In that case,

33:42.639 --> 33:45.074
I have no choice
but to expose you,

33:45.108 --> 33:47.242
tell the world who you are

33:47.277 --> 33:49.278
and how you really
built this empire.

33:49.312 --> 33:50.379
You're bluffing.

33:54.217 --> 33:56.218
Am I?

33:57.754 --> 34:01.890
You'd be exposing
your friend, too.

34:01.924 --> 34:03.625
Or is it your boyfriend?

34:03.659 --> 34:05.794
30 seconds.

34:05.828 --> 34:09.130
You're the one who warned him
I was coming, aren't you?

34:09.165 --> 34:10.599
How'd you figure it out?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.201
I know my beasts.

34:13.570 --> 34:16.071
Time's up.
You really think

34:16.106 --> 34:17.938
I'm just gonna let you
walk out of here?

34:17.974 --> 34:21.309
Yes. Because if I don't
show up in 15 minutes,

34:21.342 --> 34:23.377
my friends
are going to ruin you.

34:23.411 --> 34:27.380
Plus, you will never
see your daughter again.

34:37.359 --> 34:38.958
Who's that?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.460
CATHERINE:
That is Gabe.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.063
He's gonna kill you.

34:44.933 --> 34:46.134
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

34:46.168 --> 34:47.801
A little.
But lucky for you,

34:47.835 --> 34:50.271
I'm in a "father-daughter
reunion" kind of a mood.

34:50.304 --> 34:51.471
Don't ask me why.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.742
GABE:
On the table, please.

34:54.775 --> 34:57.424
(sighs) How do you know
this is going to work?

34:57.449 --> 34:58.645
I don't.

34:58.646 --> 35:00.146
On the other hand,
it worked on me,

35:00.180 --> 35:02.181
and me and you
have the same

35:02.215 --> 35:04.483
Muirfield strain--
so hands in the cuffs.

35:05.986 --> 35:07.854
In case you're
wondering,

35:07.888 --> 35:09.989
these are alloy steel
and titanium.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.191
So if it does work...

35:12.225 --> 35:15.494
what, I go to prison,
pay for my crimes?

35:15.529 --> 35:16.995
Something
like that.

35:17.030 --> 35:18.464
At least your daughter
can visit you there.

35:18.498 --> 35:19.532
It's better than
the alternative.

35:19.566 --> 35:20.832
Unless I die.

35:20.867 --> 35:22.301
Still, better than

35:22.335 --> 35:23.669
the alternative.

35:23.703 --> 35:25.037
(heavy sigh)

35:25.071 --> 35:27.206
Then I want to see Tori first.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.374
In case.

35:28.408 --> 35:30.008
Okay.

35:30.043 --> 35:31.276
Vincent.

35:36.015 --> 35:37.182
Daddy.

35:37.216 --> 35:38.383
I'm so sorry,
sweetheart.

35:38.417 --> 35:39.851
I never meant to hurt you.

35:39.886 --> 35:41.720
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

35:41.754 --> 35:43.288
If not...

35:43.322 --> 35:45.523
know how much I love you.

35:47.059 --> 35:49.394
How much I need you.

35:49.428 --> 35:51.663
(heart monitor beeping slowly)

35:51.697 --> 35:52.963
Okay, let's do this.

35:55.367 --> 35:57.001
Yes.

35:57.035 --> 35:58.336
Let's.

36:07.012 --> 36:08.879
(beeping accelerates)

36:10.782 --> 36:12.216
CATHERINE:
Gabe?

36:13.919 --> 36:15.720
(Windsor grunts, growls)

36:16.688 --> 36:17.988
(grunts)

36:19.724 --> 36:20.624
(snarls)

36:21.426 --> 36:23.327
(grunting)

36:26.063 --> 36:28.532
(Windsor growls, roars)

36:28.566 --> 36:29.899
(snarls)

36:29.934 --> 36:32.068
(grunting)

36:32.103 --> 36:33.870
(roars)
(bones crunch)

36:37.608 --> 36:38.975
(raspy exhale)

36:41.645 --> 36:44.814
(Tori whimpers, cries)

36:46.550 --> 36:50.353
(heart continues beating)

36:53.757 --> 36:55.691
(Tori sobs)

37:04.305 --> 37:06.275
Morning, Frankie.
Uh, could I get a...

37:06.276 --> 37:08.465
Nonfat
café Americano?

37:08.969 --> 37:11.971
Double shot, right?

37:12.005 --> 37:13.472
Are you staking me out?

37:13.506 --> 37:15.240
Well, you said you
lived around here--

37:15.275 --> 37:17.509
I thought I'd
take a chance.

37:17.543 --> 37:19.011
Here you go.

37:19.045 --> 37:20.946
I was worried about you.

37:20.981 --> 37:23.014
Why?
Because one minute

37:23.048 --> 37:24.649
we're interviewing
Windsor together,

37:24.684 --> 37:25.951
the next you're
racing off,

37:25.985 --> 37:27.586
and since I hadn't
heard from you...

37:27.620 --> 37:29.454
I can take care of myself.
(chuckles)

37:29.489 --> 37:30.856
What?

37:30.890 --> 37:33.859
Aw, nothing.
It's just, uh...

37:33.893 --> 37:37.729
your mother used to say that
to me all the time.

37:38.998 --> 37:41.665
You remind me
a lot of Vanessa.

37:41.700 --> 37:42.833
Especially in the eyes.

37:42.868 --> 37:45.136
She had
a good heart, too.

37:45.170 --> 37:47.338
Strong sense
of right and wrong.

37:47.373 --> 37:49.340
How do you know I do?

37:49.375 --> 37:51.642
Well, you're a cop, aren't you?
(laughs)

37:52.744 --> 37:54.645
So, where did you race off to?

37:57.248 --> 37:59.182
I was hoping you'd trust me.

37:59.217 --> 38:01.585
It's gonna take more
than a cup of coffee for that.

38:03.187 --> 38:05.623
But it's a start.

38:07.058 --> 38:10.060
Well, at least
Tori's safe.

38:10.094 --> 38:13.030
Wonder if we'll ever
catch her kidnapper.

38:13.064 --> 38:15.499
Who knows?

38:15.533 --> 38:17.834
So, what do you think happened?

38:19.237 --> 38:21.638
I think... Windsor
made a big mistake

38:21.672 --> 38:23.340
thinking he could handle it

38:23.374 --> 38:24.807
on his own.

38:24.842 --> 38:25.975
He obviously didn't realize

38:26.010 --> 38:27.377
who he was up against.

38:27.412 --> 38:28.878
Obviously.

38:28.913 --> 38:30.980
Still, it's a pretty
gruesome way to die.

38:32.683 --> 38:35.184
I wonder what kind of animal
would do that to someone.

38:38.556 --> 38:40.111
What do you mean
he ripped his heart out?

38:40.112 --> 38:41.414
I mean exactly that.

38:42.793 --> 38:44.760
Wh-What did Cat do?

38:44.794 --> 38:47.163
What could she do?
She was as shocked as anyone.

38:47.197 --> 38:49.731
He didn't even give us a chance
to try and save Windsor.

38:49.766 --> 38:53.335
It sounds like Vincent
just took a huge step backwards.

38:53.370 --> 38:54.503
I know.

38:54.538 --> 38:55.671
That's what has me worried.

38:55.705 --> 38:56.838
It's gonna be hard to save him

38:56.873 --> 38:58.541
if he can't save himself.

38:58.575 --> 39:00.543
You still think he's
the last beast on the list?

39:00.577 --> 39:02.077
I'm not sure.

39:02.111 --> 39:04.947
If he is, he's running
out of time, too.

39:04.981 --> 39:07.482
(grunting)

39:08.985 --> 39:11.386
You sure you don't want
to try kickboxing?

39:11.420 --> 39:13.889
It's more cathartic.

39:13.923 --> 39:16.424
Maybe I will.

39:16.459 --> 39:17.758
You okay?

39:17.793 --> 39:20.261
Me? I'm more
worried about you.

39:20.296 --> 39:22.297
Do you want to talk about it?

39:22.331 --> 39:24.632
♪
(exhales)

39:24.666 --> 39:25.633
Vincent, what happened

39:25.667 --> 39:26.767
last night?

39:26.802 --> 39:29.837
What... what made you do that?

39:31.440 --> 39:32.607
I don't know.

39:32.641 --> 39:33.908
Windsor surprised me.

39:33.942 --> 39:35.442
Okay? I still don't...

39:35.477 --> 39:38.312
know how he even broke free.

39:38.346 --> 39:41.782
It just, it happened fast.

39:43.485 --> 39:45.720
I felt this sudden...

39:45.754 --> 39:48.589
surge of energy
and then rage, and...

39:49.791 --> 39:53.327
(sighs) I reacted, okay?

39:53.361 --> 39:55.996
You know, he was
trying to kill me.

39:56.030 --> 39:57.931
Absolutely.

39:57.965 --> 39:59.566
Still...

39:59.601 --> 40:02.136
You're worried it means
I'm getting worse.

40:02.170 --> 40:04.605
I didn't say that.
But you're thinking it.

40:04.639 --> 40:06.806
I saw the look on
your face afterward.

40:06.841 --> 40:09.643
You were scared... of me.

40:09.677 --> 40:12.245
I was shocked.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.313
And then confused, because...

40:14.348 --> 40:16.582
I-I don't know
where that came from.

40:16.617 --> 40:19.485
And it's pretty much
the opposite of...

40:19.520 --> 40:20.787
Getting my humanity back.

40:23.990 --> 40:25.991
Vincent, listen...

40:26.026 --> 40:30.029
whatever's going on with you,
it isn't an exact science,

40:30.063 --> 40:32.265
and we both know that.

40:32.299 --> 40:35.168
Two steps forward,
one step back.

40:35.202 --> 40:37.002
It's okay.

40:37.037 --> 40:39.938
As long as you're at least
trying to go forward.

40:41.541 --> 40:43.275
Just one more mission, right?

40:43.309 --> 40:45.310
