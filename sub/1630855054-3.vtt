I felt like I was fucking.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.269
[Clare moaning]

00:20.229 --> 00:21.688
Thanks.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.190
Thank you. That's--

00:24.691 --> 00:25.692
Thanks.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.444
MAN:
It's just so raw.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.988
I mean, our readers
are gonna be blown away.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.659
[laughing] I mean,
obviously, with a few edits.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.619
I mean, I think
we can probably change the title:

00:35.619 --> 00:36.995
<i>The Love of My Life.</i>

00:36.995 --> 00:39.289
I mean, it's not
exactly a romance, right? So.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.333
[Clare crying]

00:42.918 --> 00:45.379
It sort of is, right?

00:45.379 --> 00:48.549
Because of the love
that I have for my mom,

00:48.549 --> 00:49.800
who died when I was--

00:49.800 --> 00:51.260
Right. Totally.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.305
But... I mean, it's also
about some pretty mind-blowing sex.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.890
[Clare crying]

00:56.890 --> 01:00.060
But then,
this volcanic sadness about your mom,

01:00.561 --> 01:03.564
and just <i>so</i> much crying.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.858
Okay. So I...

01:07.359 --> 01:08.986
It's all one thing, right?

01:08.986 --> 01:12.948
I'm-- I'm making a connection
between two things that seem separate.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.660
There's sex... and grief.
MAN: <i>Right.</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:19.913
- And I'm--
- Totally. Totally. Yes. Okay?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.916
And... it is a...

01:23.917 --> 01:25.627
- It's a brilliant essay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.589
MAN: But our readers,
they want the fucking, right?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.340
They want that raw Denis Johnson shit.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.426
And if you fix this,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.386
you could be, like,
a female Denis Johnson.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.763
You could be, like, Denise Johnson.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.390
Okay. Sorry. I don't wanna--

01:41.602 --> 01:43.228
I don't think it needs to be fixed.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.274
Sorry, I just-- I believe in my work.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.108
Look.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.445
Unless you significantly revise it,

01:52.321 --> 01:54.364
I don't think that I can publish.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.325
Pablo, this is one
of the strongest pieces I've ever written.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.826
Agreed. Agreed.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.828
And I really want it published.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.079
I <i>need</i> it published.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.080
I know.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.832
Okay?

02:03.832 --> 02:05.250
So lose the sad.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.050
[crying]

02:25.812 --> 02:27.231
- [door slams]
- Ah, shit!

02:27.898 --> 02:29.358
Frank-- Uh, Rae?

02:34.530 --> 02:35.531
Rae!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.035
Booker, you seen Rae?

02:41.703 --> 02:42.704
[sighs]

02:46.917 --> 02:48.293
Oh, thank God.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.089
Oh, Rae.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.550
Rae, hi. If you--

02:54.550 --> 02:58.011
Yeah, I've been calling for you
to help me with the groceries.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.349
[sighs] How was the game?

03:02.850 --> 03:03.851
Stupid.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.853
Okay.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.605
So I know you--

03:10.399 --> 03:12.526
I know you probably
don't wanna talk about--
- Correct.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.654
But...

03:16.989 --> 03:19.366
I know that you probably have had
twosomes before...

03:19.366 --> 03:20.617
- Mom.
- ...but this--

03:20.617 --> 03:22.744
I think
a-- a threesome is a big leap.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.621
So I was wondering

03:24.621 --> 03:28.250
if maybe you were subconsciously worried
about our little threesome.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.251
- About...
- What?

03:29.251 --> 03:30.252
...me and you and Dad.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.755
- Eww! Ew! Ew! Ew!
- No, I don't mean it in that same way.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
I'm just-- I'm not saying it in a-- I'm--

03:36.466 --> 03:38.719
Not everything is about <i>you.</i>

03:41.555 --> 03:42.556
[Rae sighs]

03:42.556 --> 03:44.057
Is this-- Is this about Carmen?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.186
Montana. Her name is Montana now.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.187
I told you that.
[Clare sighs]

03:49.271 --> 03:50.272
Of course, it is.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.150
Why not name yourself
after a beloved red state?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.860
You know,
she won't even return my texts anymore?

03:55.611 --> 03:57.279
So, yeah. Thank you!

03:57.279 --> 03:58.780
Sorry, I didn't mean to make fun of her.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.781
Mmm...

04:02.075 --> 04:03.869
[softly] Mel is gonna gloat.

04:03.869 --> 04:07.372
She-- She just always gets gloaty
when we ask for an emergency session.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.541
Well, our 16-year-old
having a fucking threesome

04:09.541 --> 04:10.876
kinda warrants one.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.006
I think it was Montana's idea.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.508
Yeah. That girl is a bad seed.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.092
It's why I never drive her home.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.802
Shit! I can't find my wallet.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.308
Do you know--
Do you know that her mother sells salt?

04:26.308 --> 04:30.437
Yeah. She imports hand-gathered sea salt.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.898
That is her actual job.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.733
I think they live in Spain.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.569
Or maybe they have
a house there or something.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.403
Mm-hmm.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.238
I don't know.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.199
All I know
is that they're rich and cosmopolitan,

04:42.199 --> 04:43.367
and we're poor and boring.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.161
I bet that they're the kind of family
that does molly

04:46.161 --> 04:47.913
and then just, like, has dinner together.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.416
Okay, well,
Rae is never eating dinner there again.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.585
Or-- Or any other meal.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.337
Lunch or snack or anything else.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.757
Well, you know, the good news
is nobody had sex at our house.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.343
Intent to commit is still a crime.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.016
I-- I don't know.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.017
I-- I think that...

05:09.977 --> 05:12.312
almost doing something is different...

05:13.105 --> 05:14.940
from <i>actually</i> doing it.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.525
[car engine starts]
[Danny sighs]

05:17.693 --> 05:18.694
I don't know, she's just--

05:19.528 --> 05:21.697
- She's gotta be smarter, you know?
- Yeah.

05:22.948 --> 05:26.285
Last thing we need
is a-- a surprise pregnancy.

might sign us on, so.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.488
What?
DANNY: Yeah. Really.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.490
- Wow.
- Thank you.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.325
But how's the-- the writing?

06:51.995 --> 06:53.288
It's fine. It's, um...

06:56.500 --> 06:58.961
I wrote something about my mom that--

06:58.961 --> 07:01.421
It might-- It might be published.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.923
- What?
- Yeah.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.924
But, uh, I--

07:05.092 --> 07:07.052
It's just co-- It's complicated. Um...

07:07.052 --> 07:09.471
- That's... amazing.
- Yeah.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.014
Can I... read it?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.100
I'll let you know.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.143
Of course. Of course.

He's still living at your mom's place?

Um, yeah.

Well...

he just crashes at mine.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.366
So, uh, um, I came, uh,

08:11.366 --> 08:13.327
I came home early from work
the other day--

08:13.327 --> 08:14.536
Before she was put on leave.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.248
Okay. Um...

08:19.082 --> 08:22.127
And, uh, I heard some noises
coming from down the hall.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.921
And what kind of noises?

08:23.921 --> 08:27.716

Uh, sex-ish noises.

At first... I thought it was Danny.

08:37.893 --> 08:38.977
What?

08:38.977 --> 08:41.438
They were coming
from our bedroom. [scoffs]

08:41.438 --> 08:44.107
Who'd-- Who the fuck
would I be having sex with?

08:44.107 --> 08:47.486
I don't know.
You kicked me out of the house,

08:47.486 --> 08:50.030
- so I don't know what you're doing.
- Okay. God, Jesus.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.824
CLARE:
That's where we are! Sorry.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.746
Then I-- I open the door...

08:59.915 --> 09:02.793
Then I open the door, and it was... Rae.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.586
And she was with two of her friends.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.587
They were half-naked,

09:05.587 --> 09:06.797
and they were just kind of,

09:07.381 --> 09:08.757
uh, tangled up on the bed.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.343
- So.
- Were they having sex?

09:11.343 --> 09:13.846
No. No, they weren't. Luckily.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.138
Well, you weren't there.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.432
Um, it's-- it's debatable, I guess.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.270
I don't think I've ever seen you so...

09:22.104 --> 09:24.481
Are you uncomfortable talking about sex?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.651
Uh, yeah, when it--
when it refers to my 16-year-old daughter.

09:27.651 --> 09:31.029
Absolutely. Hell, yeah.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm uncomfortable.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.032
And with you and Clare?

09:34.867 --> 09:36.910
- What?
- Yeah. What about us?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.370
I mean,

09:38.370 --> 09:39.997
are you both

09:39.997 --> 09:41.456
having it?

09:41.456 --> 09:42.457
Together?

09:51.842 --> 09:52.926
I wrote a song about you.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.430
Really?

09:57.764 --> 10:01.018
It's not done yet, but... yeah.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.605
I wanna hear it.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.898
[chuckles] Of course, you do.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.651
- Maybe, I don't.
- Mmm.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.196
Nah, you do.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.323
And it's good.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.117
Will you send it to me
when it's finished?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.202
I'll think about it.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.372
Only if you send me
what you wrote about your mom.

10:23.040 --> 10:23.957
Then we have a deal.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.667
- No, that's different.
- How?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.211
- That's different than a song.
- No, it's not.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.005
It's your creation.

10:30.839 --> 10:31.882
We make things.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.469
And we share them.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.515
At least... we used to.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.064
[exhales] It's-- It's been--

10:47.064 --> 10:48.690
I think we're really here
to talk about Rae.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.691
[scoffs] Yeah.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.692
DANNY:
And what's going on.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.737
And-- And-- And how--
how she's being influenced.

10:53.737 --> 10:59.660
Well, I mean, the most embedded messages
usually come from <i>in</i> the home, so.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.537
So... what?

11:03.664 --> 11:04.665
I've read your work.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.376
I looked you up
right after we first started.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.962
You are a very powerful writer.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.882
- But--
- [exhales] Okay, there's a "but."

11:13.882 --> 11:16.593
Do you think there's a chance
she read your <i>Whore</i> essay?
