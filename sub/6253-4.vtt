Look in the file.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.048
Wasn’t there a Lawrence
that worked at Ship ’N’ Print?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.394
Yes. Oliver Lawrence.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.389
He worked there for five years.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.397
He was reported missing last May.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.769
[ Exhales ]

11:38.699 --> 11:40.189
[ Object Clatters ]

11:41.577 --> 11:43.067
[Grunts]

11:43.161 --> 11:44.776
[ Sighs ]
The striations don’t match.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.614
Hey, how much of this artificial bone
do we have?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.619
Why? We’re out of weapons.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.371
Modern ones.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.919
So it is time to get medieval.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.214
Huh? Borrowed these
from our friends...

11:57.301 --> 11:59.417
over at the Antiquities Department.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.137
Oh, God.
Now this one—
This one is Viking.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.215
Comes from the funeral boat
of Gunnar the Angry.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.471
Okay, this is ridiculous, Dr. Hodgins.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.099
Do you think our killer used
a thousand-year—old battle-ax?

12:11.189 --> 12:14.681
Hey. A good scientist
never assumes.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.231
Would you like to do the honors?

12:18.322 --> 12:19.812
All right.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.649
[Sighs]

12:31.001 --> 12:32.582
Nope.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.500
What else do you have?

12:36.548 --> 12:39.130

Oh, yeah, that’ll do.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.133
[ Booth ]
Ship ’N’ Print.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.085
Thank you.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.422
Good morning.
Welcome to the Ship ’N’ Print.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.098
How may I help you
with your copying
and shipping needs?

12:49.186 --> 12:50.926
- Well, it’s the afternoon.
- Afternoon.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.512
Okay, uh, F.B.I.
I’d like to talk
to your manager.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.565
Uh, yeah, he’s-he’s—
He’s in the back.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.938
- That’s an interesting Bhavacakra.
- What?

12:59.029 --> 13:01.395
- The pendant on his neck.
- Really? Now?

13:01.490 --> 13:03.230
Well, it’s the Buddhist
wheel of life.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.611
The symbol represents
the poison of anger.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.694
Like I said before, Booth, anger is—

13:08.789 --> 13:11.576
Enough with the baklava, okay?
I just wanna talk to the manager.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.125
It’s carved from the thigh bone
of a thousand—year-old holy man.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.461
Based on the rough edges
and the lack of discoloration—
[Cell Phone Rings]

13:18.548 --> 13:21.039
that bone is not more
than 20 years old.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.083
Brennan.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.925
We figured out
what dismembered the body.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.390
A guillotine.
The killer used a gal'I/oz‘me .7

13:30.477 --> 13:32.388
Ho, ho. Wait a sec.
Guillotine?

13:32.521 --> 13:34.933
I mean, where do you
even find one of those?
Room 774.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.772
French Revolution exhibit.
We tried everything.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.272
A guillotine is the only weapon
that has a smooth blade
and the correct force profile.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.773
Okay. Guillotine it is.
Thanks.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.982
Great. Okay, so,
did you ever ship and,
uh, pack a guillotine?

13:47.077 --> 13:49.739
No. That would take
a lot of bubble wrap.
[Laughs]

13:49.830 --> 13:52.663
I wanna talk to the manager.
I don’t wanna deal
with this guy.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.250
Wait. What’s that?

13:57.045 --> 13:58.910
[ Loud Clacking ]

14:18.817 --> 14:21.524
Oliver was one of the best
employees I ever had.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.943
He had a magic touch
with the VeloBinder.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.984
You really think he’s dead?
Yes, and dismembered.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.736
No blood.
Uh, well, you know what?

14:28.827 --> 14:31.318
Lots of solvent around here,
and the killer could have cleaned up.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.745
You think he was sliced up
on my paper cutter?

14:33.832 --> 14:36.539
The imperfections on the blade
appear to be consistent...

14:36.626 --> 14:38.241
with striations
on the victim’s bones.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.827
- I’m feeling a little sick.
- Oh, join the club, huh?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.833
So any of the employees
have problems with Oliver?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.380
No, everybody loved him.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.675

back when Oliver was here,
they were tight.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.047
Wait. What do you mean
back when?

14:48.138 --> 14:50.003
Did you have a recent, uh, turnover?

14:50.098 --> 14:53.010
Everybody’s new,
except for Tony up front.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.308
What happened?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.931
Thathappened.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.307
Oh, jackpot winners, huh?
You won the lottery.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.016
Yeah. Four of us
bought a ticket together.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.726
[ Brennan ]
Fifteen million each.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.029
Yeah, and then the other three
called it rich and quit.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.524
Why not you?
Where would I go?

15:10.619 --> 15:12.530
They thought I was nuts.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.703
But I love this place.
It gives me a purpose.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.781
- The copy shop?
- We ship too.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.367
What about Oliver and Tony?
Why didn’t you include them
in the lottery pool?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.953
We invited Oliver,
but he didn’t believe in gambling,

15:23.048 --> 15:25.835
and Tony was
at his herbalist’s.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.762
[ Shaw]
They’re all lying.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.965
Oliver Lawrence was part
of the lottery pool.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.675
How do you know
they were lying?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.260
I examined the numbers
that they played.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.062
I found Oliver’s birthday,
his childhood street address...

15:41.149 --> 15:43.140
and his high school
basketball number.

15:43.235 --> 15:46.727
Okay, but the odds of finding
four disparate personality types...

15:46.822 --> 15:50.861
willing to participate in a murder
this brutal are very remote.

15:50.951 --> 15:56.696
Mmm, the likeliest scenario
is one person killed Oliver
for the ticket,

15:56.790 --> 15:59.998
the others found out
and traded silence
for shares in the win.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.584
That works for me.
Whoa. Wait, wait.
Wait a second.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.627
We can’t confront these people.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.625
You understand?
All they’re gonna do is lawyer up.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.752
With all the money
theyjust made, it’s—

16:08.844 --> 16:10.709
The investigation is just
gonna stall out for years.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.674
So we don’t confront them.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.266
We ask for their help.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.187
Cam was able to do
a preliminary tox screen
on the victim.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.855
Nothing extraordinary,

16:23.942 --> 16:25.978
except he drank a lot of coffee.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.900
Ship ’N’ Print
is open 24 hours a day.

16:27.988 --> 16:31.025
Anybody’s gonna need
a little caffeine to get ’em
through the night shift.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.981
We still don’t know
what killed the victim?

16:33.076 --> 16:35.283
Dr. Edison found
some defensive wounds,

16:35.370 --> 16:38.032
and he’s determining
if one was cause of death.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.996
What are you doing?
Oh.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.200
Shaw had some of the FBI. techs
bring over this copy machine.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.785
I’m gonna see
what shipping info...

16:44.880 --> 16:46.996
is stored in the copier’s memory.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.048
Oh. You need
the whole machine
to do that?

16:50.135 --> 16:52.877
Shaw didn’t want Booth to think
that she overlooked anything.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.711

16:55.765 --> 16:57.596
How’s he doin’, by the way?

16:58.602 --> 17:00.217
I don’t know.
He won’t talk about it.

17:00.312 --> 17:04.601
Yeah. Well, can’t imagine
losing my dad.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.734
I should be able
to help Booth, shouldn’t I?

17:15.118 --> 17:16.949
it’s not your fault.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.040
But you would be able
to help Hodgins.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.160
Booth could help me.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.999
What would you do?

17:29.591 --> 17:33.709
Booth loves you, Brennan, not me.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.180
It doesn’t matter
what anybody else would do.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.391
You have to figure out
what you can give him...

17:41.478 --> 17:44.311
that nobody else can.

Uh, Sheila Burnside
has certainly grown...

17:59.496 --> 18:01.532

was taken.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.831
Well, with all that money,
I’m tellin’ you, she can afford to grow.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.375

Hmm? He doesn’t talk
to the others.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.252
That’s interesting.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.212
There is Ralph Berti.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.390
He started working
at Ship ’N’ Print after
a bitter divorce wiped him out.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.139
So you think showing them
old mug shots is gonna help?

18:25.230 --> 18:27.061
It’s the same principle
as a Rorschach test.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.560
It allows them to open up
and drop their defenses.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.141
Right.

18:35.657 --> 18:39.024
I’m Special Agent Booth.
This here is my associate,
Dr. Lance Sweets.

I can help with
the grief counseling
if necessary.

18:41.913 --> 18:46.498

what happened to Oliver,
and it’s just awful.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.298
Well, perhaps you
can help us find his killer.

Yeah. We have some customers
here from Ship ’N’ Print...

18:57.429 --> 18:59.420
who have criminal records
for assault.

18:59.556 --> 19:04.300
Maybe you can recognize someone
who had an altercation
with Oliver.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.134
For sure. Definitely.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.515
We get a lot
of creeps in there.

I remember him.
Don’t you?

19:12.819 --> 19:16.732
Yeah. Uh, you know what? I do.
He was a real troublemaker.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.441
- He, uh— He stole a box
of yellow highlighters once.

Are you kidding, Connor?
I do.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.572
Me too. Definitely.
He screamed at me once.
Right, Hugh?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.283
And then you reported it to Connor.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.790
- No, you didn’t.
- Yeah. I did.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.293
Maybe you have a reason
to protect him, Connor.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.419
You all have had it out
for me because I stayed.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.717
You have to admit,
it’s pretty wacked.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.428
Yeah, I mean, there was
a lot of money—
It was weird.

19:42.557 --> 19:45.094

and you just stayed.
Excuse us for a moment.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.348
Wejust need to, uh,
run that suspect back
through our system.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.929
Just keep looking.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.356
You know, Sheila knew
that fingering one
of those mug shots...

19:53.443 --> 19:54.899
would’ve taken the heat
right off her.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.647
Yeah, but her husband’s
clearly the submissive one.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.193
He’s the one who’ll crack.
She could’ve gotten him
to, uh, kill Oliver.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.784
Did you see the way—
[Cell Phone Rings]

20:01.868 --> 20:03.233
I mean, he’s a piece of work.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.693
Hold on. Booth.

20:04.788 --> 20:08.076
Every time an employee
uses the printer at Ship ’N’ Print,

20:08.166 --> 20:10.748
they have to punch in
an ID. code first.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.416
Wait, who printed the labels?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.332

20:18.093 --> 20:20.254
[No Audible Dialogue]

20:25.892 --> 20:28.975
I-I didn’t kill Oliver.
I liked him, kind of.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.095
[ Sweets ] Kind of?
He was a goody two-shoes,
you know?

20:31.189 --> 20:33.521
A reformed drinker.
Did everything by the book.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.064
Not really a fun guy.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.439
Oh, so you figured
he wouldn’t enjoy
all those millions?

20:38.571 --> 20:41.984
No. No. Not like that.
We know Oliver picked some
of the winning numbers, Ralph.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.316
He should’ve gotten
the money too, right?

20:48.415 --> 20:53.205
Okay. Uh, the five of us
bought the ticket together.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.912
We-We were saving his share
until he came back.
We didn’t kill him for it.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.339
Amazing how these four are
always changing their story
all the time.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.837
[ Ralph ]
That is the truth. I swear it.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.964
Right. I would believe you,
but we have these.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.717
These are logs
of the employee codes
used on the printer.

21:06.808 --> 21:10.801
Right? The labels for the boxes
that contain Oliver’s
body parts, all right—

21:10.895 --> 21:13.307
they were all posted
using your code.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.854
- You’re kidding.
- No, I’m not kidding.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.349
Does it look like
I’m kidding?
No.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.060
Everybody used my code
because it was 1—2-3-4.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.816
It doesn’t get easier
than that, right?

21:21.906 --> 21:23.737
But if you check
the printer memory,

21:23.825 --> 21:27.534
I’ll bet 90% of the time,
the code that was used was mine.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.704
I still haven’t been able
to determine cause of death.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.577
There are microfractures...

21:33.710 --> 21:36.543
on the third
and fourth left ribs.
And on his left radius.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.336
Defensive wounds consistent
with a fistfight.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.836
So there was a struggle
before he was killed.

21:41.926 --> 21:46.044
I did find kerf marks
on his right acromion.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.221
Oh, very small kerf marks.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.971
And they’re on
the right greater tubercle.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.803
And on his right olecranon.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.934
The victim struggles
with his assailant,

21:57.025 --> 22:00.188
and then is struck multiple times
on the right side...

22:00.278 --> 22:02.610
with something
that approximates a tiny saw.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.362
Good work, Dr. Edison.
But I have no answers.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.947
You will. I wouldn’t hire a fool.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.405
I suppose that’s true.
Thank you. Oh!

And I’m glad to see
that your breasts seem
to be feeling better.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.352
I don’t want Temperance
to come home to burnt garlic.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.355
I never burn the garlic.
I do it just the way
you taught me.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.902
I don’t think so.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.650
Come on, look.
It’s simmering, huh?

22:46.741 --> 22:50.074
Sorry. I guess I miss
bossing you around.

You sure you gotta
take off tomorrow?
Yes.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.366
I’ll deliver these to the VA,
and then I’m back.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.539
So what are all those papers for?

22:56.626 --> 22:59.959
Oh, probate forms,

I haven’t seen him in 20 years.

You’re next of kin.
Well, so are you.

23:10.515 --> 23:14.599
So is Jared.
No, your father made you
sole executor and beneficiary.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.517
Ha. Beneficiary.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.641
Having him for a father
wasn’t exactly a benefit, Pops.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.641
- Seeley—
- Look, you were my father.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.482
All right?
He was never there for me.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.938
You raised me, not him.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.240
He was never there.
Understand?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.988
You don’t have to defend him to me.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.070
I wasn’t.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.952
I was just trying to remind you
that he was my son.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.920
Good or bad, he was my son.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.998
And I gotta tell you,
I’m a little disappointed...

23:47.093 --> 23:50.836
that you don’t seem to see
the hurt I’m feeling.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.015
I’m sorry, Pops.

24:02.025 --> 24:04.858
You don’t think I know
what it was like for you?

24:04.944 --> 24:08.528
You don’t think
I don’t feel responsible?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.574
I raised him.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.863
Don’t you feel responsible
for your boy?

24:17.165 --> 24:18.780
Now, Seeley, we’re family.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.708
We gotta get through this together.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.375
You’re right.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.961
Okay. Anything for you, Pops.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.546
Anything.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.719
I’ll get the sauce.
I don’t wanna burn the garlic.

24:43.441 --> 24:46.023
Boiling point
for the polystyrene...

24:46.110 --> 24:49.694
is higher than the lipids
by 15 degrees Celsius.

24:49.781 --> 24:53.899
So you can separate the liquids
from the tissue sticking
to the packing peanuts.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.985
And skim off the solids
and particulates...

24:57.080 --> 24:58.570
as it simmers.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.326
Excuse me.

25:00.416 --> 25:05.035
Ooh! This looks like a piece
of sternocleidomastoid muscle.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.415
Well, be my guest.
All those chunks are yours.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.509
There’s something in here.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.466
Looks like a piece of tape.
Mmm.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.545
[ Hodgins ] Some of the packing
material probably stuck to it
while it was decomposing.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.929
No. It’s embedded in the muscle.
It was here when he died.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.930
But how did it get there?

25:23.898 --> 25:25.513
[Angela ]
Well, Ralph’s story checks out.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.099
Ninety-six percent
of the jobs
on the printer...

25:28.194 --> 25:30.025
were done
using Ralph’s code.

25:30.113 --> 25:33.321
Now, I found something else
in the printer’s memory.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.155
This was taken
two days before
Oliver was murdered.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.953
Why would someone
photocopy their buttocks?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.908
Well, I guess they were doin’
some kinky calisthenics on the job.

25:45.628 --> 25:46.788
Look at this.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.662
Look at the hand
next to the butt.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.624
Didn’t Clark say
there was a bone growth
on the victim’s left hand?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.255
Yes. A sesamoid.

25:54.345 --> 25:58.384
Which means that this tush
was making whoopee
with the victim.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.762
So now we just have to
figure out whose tush this is.

26:01.853 --> 26:05.562
The lighter area
indicates where the ischia
are pressing onto the copier.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.058
The darker areas are flesh.

26:07.150 --> 26:10.313
Can you measure
the ischia! tuberosities
on her pelvic girdle?

26:11.320 --> 26:12.821
Yeah.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.941
24.3 centimeters.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.696
Those are some narrow hips.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.745
Only about five percent
of women have hips that narrow.

26:22.832 --> 26:26.666
There was only one woman
among the lottery winners.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.541
Enlarge the woman,
focusing on her hips.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.925
Narrow hips.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.924
So Sheila lures him
to the copier, kills him...

26:39.015 --> 26:40.755
and then takes his share
of the money...

a new pair of boobs.

Not to rub it in,
but I did, actually.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.889
The tape had more
than just muscle tissue on it.

It also contained a piece
of an artery.

subclavian artery.

on the weapon was loose,

Maybe. You mind
if I take a look at that?

the number and size of bony

to a histological section
from our victim’s skeleton?

36:17.259 --> 36:19.591
No. ljust assumed
it was from our victim.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.589

we visited a few people
who received those packages.

because they didn’t
wanna go to jail.

and you were shipping them at night.

He said he was
gonna call the police.

37:25.369 --> 37:28.076
