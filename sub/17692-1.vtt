00:27.480 --> 00:31.210
First, we must begin by explaining my profession.

00:33.270 --> 00:37.730
What I most greatly require

00:37.730 --> 00:39.300
is corpses.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.150
1878   London

00:52.510 --> 00:54.560
It was proven that after death

00:54.560 --> 00:59.790
a person's body will lighten by 21 grams compared to their weight while alive.

00:54.560 --> 00:59.790
T/n: A reference to the ideas of early 20th-century American physician Duncan MacDougall.

01:02.090 --> 01:04.540
This is the weight of the soul's essence

01:04.540 --> 01:06.910
or what one might consider the weight of the soul.

01:09.290 --> 01:12.270
By installing an artificial soul essence

01:12.690 --> 01:15.040
into a corpse that has lost its soul

01:15.040 --> 01:17.030
we are able to resurrect the dead.

01:18.290 --> 01:21.680
However, that is a false soul.

01:27.310 --> 01:31.690
Dr. Victor Frankenstein resurrected the first corpse—

01:31.690 --> 01:33.260
The One.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.190
It is said he was able to speak

01:36.540 --> 01:37.900
pursue love

01:38.270 --> 01:40.370
and even harbor murderous intent.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.450
In his despair

01:44.250 --> 01:48.600
he took the technologies he developed— the Memorandum of Victor

01:48.600 --> 01:50.530
and disappeared.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.840
He left us only

01:55.840 --> 01:57.510
imitations of The One

01:57.510 --> 02:01.740
dolls lacking both souls and language.

02:04.130 --> 02:06.270
If The One possessed a soul

02:07.600 --> 02:13.110
if that 21 gram soul could be returned to empty bodies

02:13.960 --> 02:16.190
then could those who have passed away

02:16.860 --> 02:18.590
live once more?

02:27.690 --> 02:28.650
Move.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.200
Can you see me?

02:53.990 --> 02:55.690
Do you recognize me?

03:06.890 --> 03:07.910
Walk.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.590
Stop.

03:20.790 --> 03:23.690
Power output...is working fine.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.310
Reach out.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.390
Take this pen.

03:48.610 --> 03:51.620
Write down every conversation and action.

03:53.230 --> 03:56.020
I hope this will become your soul.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.130
Welcome back, Friday.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.120
T/n: A reference to the character in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.710
Now, just prior to the turn of the 20th century

04:13.390 --> 04:17.459
corpse technologies are already able to control a nation's fate.

04:20.470 --> 04:26.910
When Dr. Victor Frankenstein succeeded in resurrecting the dead 100 years ago

04:28.560 --> 04:33.370
people feared and detested resurrection

04:33.370 --> 04:38.080
and steadfastly rejected corpse technology.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.660
The earliest to accept corpses were women.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.560
If corpses were to act as soldiers,

04:49.560 --> 04:54.480
they would not have to lose their husbands and sons to war.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.020
The world realized the value of corpse technologies for military affairs

05:02.020 --> 05:05.290
and began to strongly push the development of corpse technology forward.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.250
The military technology born amidst this

05:12.250 --> 05:14.080
also enabled civilian uses.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.080
It has throroughly changed people's everyday lives.

05:19.770 --> 05:23.930
Artificial soul essences, made from repeated simulations by analytical engines

05:23.930 --> 05:26.650
and recorded onto punch cards

05:26.650 --> 05:28.750
have been named "Necroware."

05:29.500 --> 05:37.020
They are making optimizations for coachmen, housekeepers, laborers, and various fields of work.

05:44.090 --> 05:47.480
In the living world, corpses increase with each passing day.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.500
Even now, it is hardly an overstatement

05:49.500 --> 05:54.170
to say that corpses are the backbone of the world economy.

05:57.600 --> 06:01.630
At the once frightening fortress, the Tower of London

06:04.300 --> 06:06.640
here, corpse engineers

06:06.640 --> 06:09.490
improve Necroware day after day,

06:09.490 --> 06:13.970
endlessly supplying updates to the corpses of the world

06:14.840 --> 06:18.530
by means of the analytical engine of exceptional calculation capabilities

06:18.530 --> 06:21.460
the Charles Babbage.

06:18.530 --> 06:21.460
T/n: An English polymath and "father of the computer."

06:27.290 --> 06:30.760
This is a tale of corpses.

 Please support the official release by Funimation.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.140
A Cambridge Engine

06:57.140 --> 07:01.470
extended with an Edinburgh Language Engine into a dual engine soul analysis configuration.

07:01.470 --> 07:04.450
You were able to do this in such a short time.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.340
How elegant.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.040
But

07:12.040 --> 07:15.740
you too must realize that soul essence analysis is a national secret.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.870
Knowledge of it is a serious crime.

07:20.490 --> 07:23.630
Yet you still took the risk. Just what were you intending?

07:25.470 --> 07:27.920
The survivors might feel quite grieved

07:28.420 --> 07:32.360
if they were to know that it was the deceased's dearest friend who stole the remains.

07:33.170 --> 07:36.380
The tabloids wouldn't keep quiet either.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.280
The abnormal love of an outstanding University of London medical student.

07:43.210 --> 07:47.860
Resurrecting corpses without permission and installing illegal Necroware

07:47.860 --> 07:50.180
for that, imprisonment is unavoidable.

07:54.570 --> 07:57.620
Did you believe I didn't anticipate that I'd be traced?

08:00.220 --> 08:01.520
Never mind.

08:02.120 --> 08:07.130
How could I allow such talent and enthusiasm to rot away in this cave?

08:07.130 --> 08:09.920
Her Royal Majesty isn't this devoid of sense.

08:13.150 --> 08:15.640
Shall we make a deal then?

08:16.810 --> 08:18.930
I am M.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.980
Come serve the British Empire

08:22.610 --> 08:24.770
John Watson.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.340
 1878   British India   Bombay

09:08.070 --> 09:12.110
Former U.S. President, Ulysses S. Grant.

09:13.140 --> 09:18.050
Did he come to personally hawk the technologies developed in the Civil War?

09:27.740 --> 09:29.330
What was that just now?

09:29.330 --> 09:31.050
What exploded?

09:39.470 --> 09:42.310
Don't sit around dumbstruck, student.

09:43.310 --> 09:44.430
What are you doing!

09:45.260 --> 09:48.060
You don't want to die on the frontlines, do you?

09:49.510 --> 09:50.700
Let's go!

10:07.710 --> 10:10.250
Hurry and throw it off! It'll explode!

10:11.610 --> 10:12.420
Friday!

10:12.420 --> 10:14.300
Do something!

10:18.630 --> 10:19.850
Damn!

10:23.390 --> 10:25.940
What is with that man?

10:25.940 --> 10:28.500
They're Russian controlled corpse explosives.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.770
Explosives that aren't shipped as cargo

10:30.770 --> 10:33.520
but instead are made from the corpses themselves.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.720
Through breaking the fats down into glycerol?

10:37.050 --> 10:38.290
It's well made.

10:38.290 --> 10:40.240
Is now the time to be admiring them?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.800
The next wave is on its way.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.220
Get in and hold on tight!

10:49.200 --> 10:51.920
The Russians are giving it their all too.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.630
Why are they shooting?

11:01.090 --> 11:05.100
They're aiming at the valuables. It's not just us.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.420
Friday, take the gun out of my bag!

11:25.280 --> 11:26.700
Hurry and get rid of him!

11:26.700 --> 11:27.610
Friday!

11:27.610 --> 11:29.380
Shoot him!

11:31.200 --> 11:32.510
Friday!

11:32.510 --> 11:33.710
Use the gun you're holding!

11:33.710 --> 11:35.460
Shoot him in the head!

11:40.380 --> 11:41.680
Shoot!

11:52.800 --> 11:54.380
How bothersome.

11:54.730 --> 11:56.510
Let's switch.

11:56.510 --> 11:57.690
Switch?

11:57.690 --> 12:00.070
Just sit here and hold onto the reins.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.800
Don't say it like it's easy!

12:20.180 --> 12:23.120
Well, that's dealt with.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.850
You're Burnaby.

12:25.850 --> 12:28.280
Captain Frederick Burnaby?

12:23.760 --> 12:27.810
T/n: An English traveller and soldier.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.350
The guide assigned by Walsingham

12:30.350 --> 12:32.240
or rather, someone to monitor me?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.240
Wrong on both counts.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.940
I'm here to babysit an idiot, corpse enthusiast student.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.650
Don't be so put off.

12:41.650 --> 12:45.460
Just like with your predecessors, at worst, I'll still send your corpse back.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.380
It's an age where even a corpse can serve their country.

12:48.380 --> 12:49.300
Predecessors?

12:49.300 --> 12:50.720
What's that about?

12:50.720 --> 12:52.290
He got blown up by explosives.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.300
That's why they dispatched you.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.300
I didn't hear of this!

12:56.300 --> 12:57.780
Probably forgot to tell you.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.550
Well, that was just bad luck.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.070
Best of luck to you.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.050
Oh, that's right.

13:06.050 --> 13:08.820
Write down that I'm a handsome man.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.910
You don't need to write that, Friday.

13:11.850 --> 13:14.460
Hey, hey, let him work a little!

13:14.460 --> 13:16.640
It's you who's getting in the way of his work.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.700
There's quite a few infantry.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.390
The older Krishna organization

13:35.390 --> 13:37.710
as well as the Carabinieri.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.100
They're being sent to Afghanistan.

13:41.460 --> 13:45.010
Soon there'll be more dead than living.

13:45.010 --> 13:48.470
For a corpse engineer like you, it'd be rather interesting place.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.830
This isn't for you.

13:53.830 --> 13:55.060
I don't want it.

13:55.060 --> 13:58.570
Oh right, there's something for you.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.610
Here.

14:00.430 --> 14:01.530
What is it?

14:01.530 --> 14:03.050
Sent over by Walsingham.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.610
Identification papers?

14:04.610 --> 14:06.270
To use as a disguise.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.410
A medical school professor acting as a military doctor.

14:12.410 --> 14:15.310
I haven't graduated yet...

14:17.340 --> 14:18.420
This man...

14:19.780 --> 14:22.770
Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov.

14:19.810 --> 14:23.620
T/n: Protagonist and youngest brother in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.170
He was a military chaplain in the Russian Empire...

14:27.170 --> 14:32.430
The man purported to be the Romanov Dynasty's Dr. Frankenstein, correct?

14:34.250 --> 14:37.680
Three months ago, that corpse engineer

14:38.340 --> 14:42.300
lead military corpses in an armed rebellion.

14:42.300 --> 14:45.610
We lost track of him in inland Afghanistan.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.570
What was his goal?

14:47.570 --> 14:51.320
To establish a new kingdom with corpses as subjects.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.170
As the price to avoid punishment

14:54.170 --> 14:57.720
let me infiltrate war torn Afghanistan

14:57.720 --> 14:59.750
to investigate that kingdom.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.460
Karamazov took with him

15:05.460 --> 15:10.850
the lost research notes of Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

15:10.850 --> 15:12.440
The Memorandum of Victor.

15:13.300 --> 15:17.770
The technology behind the creation of the only corpse that had a soul and possessed language—

15:18.420 --> 15:21.490
The One— is recorded in there...

15:22.300 --> 15:26.400
The Third Section under the Tsar's control has also begun to move.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.400
T/n: The Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery served as the regime's secret police.

15:27.150 --> 15:29.230
This is the Great Game.

15:29.230 --> 15:32.200
Whether it's the Russian Empire, or Karamazov

15:32.200 --> 15:35.660
we cannot allow them to seize world hegemony.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.220
To investigate the circumstances of the empire of corpses

15:39.220 --> 15:41.170
and secure the Memorandum of Victor...

15:41.170 --> 15:44.190
That is your mission.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.720
You've come rather late.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.770
I had almost thought you'd died.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.400
We ran into more than a few things.

16:03.400 --> 16:08.320
Seems they don't teach you about punctuality in Britain.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.570
You're the same impertinent brat as ever.

16:13.010 --> 16:16.860
Pleased to meet you. I am Nikolai Krasotkin.

16:13.010 --> 16:16.850
T/n: A character in <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.

16:16.860 --> 16:19.390
I'm Watson. John Watson.

16:19.740 --> 16:24.080
A madman engineer who, on their own initiative, turned their friend into a corpse.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.470
Well, I won't press that issue for the time being.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.260
I've been eagerly awaiting you

16:29.260 --> 16:30.900
Dr. Watson.

16:31.430 --> 16:33.210
This way, then.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.340
That man's Russian, isn't he.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.070
We were nearly killed by his comrades in Bombay!

16:39.070 --> 16:40.500
No worries.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.010
He's a collaborator

16:42.010 --> 16:44.020
to guide us.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.550
As if I could believe that!

16:45.550 --> 16:46.810
Hey, Burnaby!

16:46.810 --> 16:51.060
The new techniques that Karamazov acquired from the Memorandum...

16:51.060 --> 16:53.200
Don't you want to see them?

17:03.610 --> 17:05.250
Let's go, Friday.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.400
You are also pursuing the Memorandum, aren't you?

17:22.780 --> 17:25.319
Why are you cooperating with us?

17:25.319 --> 17:27.770
Please, there's no need to worry.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.360
I'll let you have the Memorandum.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.960
We need only ensure Karamazov's person

17:33.960 --> 17:35.660
that will be enough.

17:35.670 --> 17:37.480
So that's how it is.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.310
There are internal turmoils in the Russian Empire.

17:41.990 --> 17:45.610
The sought after outcomes are different, so the path there will also differ.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.120
That's all.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.250
We've a long ways to go.

17:52.250 --> 17:56.090
We're all special agents here, so let's try to get along.

18:10.740 --> 18:11.900
Alright.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.230
Reload and try again.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.480
How valiant.

18:28.010 --> 18:29.540
They're self defense methods.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.250
Although their cognitive ability is no match for a human

18:32.250 --> 18:34.460
never hesitating is also very outstanding.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.800
But I hope that what he shoots isn't you.

18:40.530 --> 18:43.680
Are you from the same place as Alexei Karamazov?

18:44.390 --> 18:46.710
It's exactly as your materials have written.

18:48.110 --> 18:52.450
He stole the Memorandum during a corpse soldier experiment

18:52.770 --> 18:55.530
along with some test subjects.

18:55.530 --> 18:59.420
Did he succeed in the reappearance of The One?

18:59.420 --> 19:01.040
What's in the Memorandum...

19:01.040 --> 19:05.410
Or no, I heard that he completed the analysis of the Memorandum...

19:05.410 --> 19:07.410
Who knows.

19:07.750 --> 19:12.510
Did he want to set up an assassin organization, like the ancient assassins' sects?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.300
Due to these doubts

19:15.300 --> 19:19.430
we must handle this case in a covert, sophisticated manner.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.680
But with regards to you

19:21.680 --> 19:24.930
you can't allow Karamazov to be killed.

19:25.820 --> 19:29.650
Whatever he did in those remote, uninhabited regions

19:30.250 --> 19:33.740
if it suits the interests of the nation, I must bring it back.

19:34.940 --> 19:39.280
He's currently in the Kokcha Valley north of Kabul.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.790
If you even knew that

19:41.790 --> 19:44.280
why are you still collaborating with us?

19:44.280 --> 19:48.330
Because we need you

19:48.330 --> 19:50.560
Dr. Watson.

19:51.100 --> 19:56.070
An expert in corpse technology, like you.

20:02.090 --> 20:03.260
Fire!

20:06.190 --> 20:10.270
1878   Khyber Pass

20:14.520 --> 20:18.870
Without amassing more enemies, firing is just a waste of ammunition.

20:18.870 --> 20:20.680
Let them fight.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.540
Before so many corpse soldiers

20:28.740 --> 20:30.750
expecting them to maintain self-restraint is harsh.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.030
Victory or defeat

20:39.030 --> 20:41.130
can be predicted with a single calculation

20:42.240 --> 20:44.690
what's the purpose of a real battle?

20:45.260 --> 20:48.760
In that case, it becomes a mere game.

20:49.110 --> 20:52.500
Mankind needs legends.

20:52.500 --> 20:58.270
Legends bursting with words that are burning with passion.

20:58.270 --> 21:02.840
The majority of people cannot understand your theory.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.820
Without understanding it, they cannot accept it

21:05.820 --> 21:09.630
other than those who can personally see and experience it.

21:11.180 --> 21:15.240
Stories are born from our foolishness

21:15.240 --> 21:16.960
reaffirming it repeatedly.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.210
And the conclusion

21:20.210 --> 21:22.300
is this?

21:27.440 --> 21:29.220
Seems like the path has eased up a bit.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.060
Don't let your guard down.

21:32.060 --> 21:35.020
Enemies can see very clearly here.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.730
You really will die if you're absentminded.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.460
Curses!

21:45.460 --> 21:46.570
Split up, quickly!

21:51.150 --> 21:54.530
This might turn into something interesting, for the first time in a while.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.530
Please, step back.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.840
Friday, level the gun.

22:21.450 --> 22:23.360
I can hardly believe it

22:23.360 --> 22:26.000
he can even predict the opponent's movements.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.320
Is he really a corpse?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.160
He dodged it!

22:38.550 --> 22:42.880
Did my country implement that, after all?

22:44.130 --> 22:45.550
Dr. Watson!

22:45.620 --> 22:48.860
That's Necroware developed by Karamazov!

22:52.840 --> 22:57.430
It's so dexterous, the movement ability of each joint's coordinated activity.

22:57.430 --> 23:02.220
The ability to grasp the situation and to predict and choose the best strategy

23:03.010 --> 23:05.730
is entirely unlike corpses up until now.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.580
They possess intent to kill

23:09.280 --> 23:11.870
a murderous intent.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.960
What we seek—

23:19.860 --> 23:22.240
the technologies of Victor — is there.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.460
It's endless.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.340
Watson!

24:15.340 --> 24:16.210
Hurry!

24:16.210 --> 24:17.380
Don't be so captivated.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.150
It's not that!

24:24.890 --> 24:25.860
Is there...

24:25.860 --> 24:28.200
no other way?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.280
There isn't.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.530
Hurry it up.

24:31.530 --> 24:35.280
You want that woman to come rescue you?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.960
I get it.

24:38.030 --> 24:39.440
Burnaby...

24:39.440 --> 24:41.260
I'm not going to listen to your last words.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.660
Those new types...

24:45.190 --> 24:47.040
Can we capture one?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.260
What?

25:20.870 --> 25:23.290
Install. Supply power.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.500
Was the murderous intent I felt

25:28.500 --> 25:31.290
from this corpse himself

25:32.270 --> 25:37.740
or was it merely due to a difference in the installed programs?

25:38.900 --> 25:40.710
Does he have language?

25:41.270 --> 25:43.030
Does he possess a soul?

25:44.490 --> 25:45.550
Move.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.280
Increase the load on the cognition control system.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.330
This is it. It's these eyes.

26:16.090 --> 26:17.800
Can you speak?

26:21.430 --> 26:23.400
Increase the output rate, Friday.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.800
What is your name?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.930
Say it!

26:29.930 --> 26:31.440
Say your name!

26:52.620 --> 26:54.460
Experiment suspended

26:55.180 --> 26:56.340
Friday.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.790
Why did you ask for the corpse's name?

27:13.550 --> 27:14.770
What do you mean?

27:15.470 --> 27:18.320
Perhaps it has something to do with your friend?

27:19.610 --> 27:22.660
Noble_Savage_007.

27:23.210 --> 27:27.870
This is Friday's registered name, as one of Walsingham's assets.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.360
The dead are of course assigned unique numbers

27:31.360 --> 27:33.290
as a symbol of their identity.

27:33.290 --> 27:35.710
Names will be abandoned.

27:35.710 --> 27:40.380
Even if you analyze the ID, you can see naught but their basic performance.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.720
Corpses have no need of names

27:42.720 --> 27:44.800
they cannot speak.

27:45.910 --> 27:49.260
Just why do you seek the Memorandum so dearly?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.080
Aren't all those who deal with corpse technology like that?

27:56.080 --> 27:59.150
You're more or less the same, no?

28:01.530 --> 28:05.300
A conviction in technology is like instinct for them.

28:07.420 --> 28:11.410
If they could see it so clearly, it might be relaxing.

28:15.630 --> 28:16.650
Yes.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.940
The Memorandum might be real, Friday.

28:43.790 --> 28:47.240
It might even prove your theory true.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.580
You must be Dr. Watson.

28:54.880 --> 28:59.420
I am Hadaly. President Grant's secretary.

28:54.880 --> 28:59.410
T/n: Reference to the character in <i>The Future Eve</i> by Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam.

28:59.420 --> 29:02.630
Earlier, in that dangerous place...

29:03.400 --> 29:06.590
The Honorable Ulysses S. Grant enjoys taking risks.

29:14.990 --> 29:16.730
Did he have a soul?

29:18.070 --> 29:19.570
That corpse earlier

29:19.570 --> 29:21.570
moved about like a living human

29:21.570 --> 29:23.570
and also retained intelligence.

29:23.570 --> 29:25.110
Then, what of the soul?

29:26.000 --> 29:30.600
My friend often used to say, thought precedes language.

29:31.130 --> 29:32.830
And that corpse

29:32.830 --> 29:35.500
tried to speak.

29:36.020 --> 29:41.750
In other words, is the soul hidden behind thought?

29:42.410 --> 29:45.450
At the moment, it's no more than speculation

29:45.450 --> 29:47.520
but I'll definitely prove it.

29:49.070 --> 29:53.070
Is your soul wishing for that?

29:55.180 --> 29:59.360
I've never once felt a soul

30:00.740 --> 30:03.400
and I have no idea what it really is.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.450
Perhaps he and I are even closer.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.590
May we meet again, somewhere.

30:27.930 --> 30:31.730
You can't be too certain about women like that.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.380
Be careful.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.350
Why did Karamazov want to steal corpse soldiers to start his rebellion?

32:41.070 --> 32:43.240
Based on the new types of corpses

32:43.240 --> 32:45.980
it would seem the reappearance of The One is already imminent.

32:47.740 --> 32:50.020
Does he require a reason?

32:50.020 --> 32:53.200
If he at least had a reason, I could be convinced.

32:54.060 --> 32:57.730
Your mission is to secure the Memorandum

32:57.730 --> 33:01.660
not to investigate the causes or reasons behind the event, is it not?

33:02.760 --> 33:07.680
You can ask Aloysha about his story yourself.

33:09.430 --> 33:10.740
We've arrived.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.150
Women and children corpses....

33:44.540 --> 33:46.370
I've waited a long time

33:46.370 --> 33:48.130
Dr. Watson.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.340
I am Alexei Karamazov.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.970
You're in exceedingly good health

33:57.970 --> 33:59.510
Aloysha.

33:59.510 --> 34:02.860
You've worked hard, Kolya.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.020
Thank goodness you were able to make it.

34:05.020 --> 34:08.420
If bringing us here was your mission

34:08.420 --> 34:11.340
I wish we could have taken an easier route.

34:11.690 --> 34:15.489
The British Empire has taken a strong interest in the current incident.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.199
I hope you can inform us of your motives.

34:23.469 --> 34:27.280
It was something Nikolai and I discovered

34:27.280 --> 34:31.110
during a mission to a small island in the Arctic Circle.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.639
Dr. Watson.

34:35.770 --> 34:39.340
Why is it that you seek the Memorandum?

34:39.350 --> 34:41.350
For the reappearance of The One

34:41.350 --> 34:43.810
or perhaps by the nation's command?

34:43.810 --> 34:47.270
In the pursuit of corpse technology, a just cause matters not.

34:49.010 --> 34:52.400
I had also pursued the reappearance of The One in the past

34:52.400 --> 34:55.110
conducting experiments again and again.

34:55.110 --> 34:57.690
The countless corpses that accumulated

34:57.690 --> 35:00.010
the countless eyes that had lost their radiance...

35:00.010 --> 35:02.910
When I noticed that it was myself that was reflected in those eyes

35:02.910 --> 35:05.400
I came to my senses

35:06.190 --> 35:09.770
and asked myself what exactly it was that I was pursuing.

35:12.790 --> 35:15.400
I will ask you once more.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.650
Why is it that you seek the Memorandum?

35:19.790 --> 35:21.720
The advancement of corpse technology

35:21.720 --> 35:23.630
and the reappearance of The One.

35:24.910 --> 35:28.880
Even if you would have to break taboos?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.560
There will always be a day

35:30.560 --> 35:33.710
when even forbidden technology becomes normal and proper.

35:34.410 --> 35:37.690
In any case, nowadays corpses have been integrated into life.

35:37.690 --> 35:39.300
So it is.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.970
Once a technology is born

35:41.970 --> 35:45.330
it will never again be stopped by anyone's will.

35:45.330 --> 35:48.800
Because of this, Nikolai and I dealt away with the information

35:48.800 --> 35:51.290
and altered the important portions.

35:53.360 --> 35:57.710
The Russian Empire has already introduced the new corpse type to the battlefield.

35:57.710 --> 36:00.840
The world order will be restructured.

36:01.950 --> 36:04.260
Britain hasn't turned a blind eye to this.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.010
Where is the Memorandum?

36:08.030 --> 36:10.180
If you pursue the Memorandum

36:10.180 --> 36:12.910
then you must promise that you'll destroy it.

36:12.910 --> 36:14.140
Why?

36:14.140 --> 36:16.100
There is no reason.

36:16.100 --> 36:19.530
The sum of your words up until this moment

36:19.530 --> 36:22.530
will eventually determine your legacy.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.300
Friday...

37:11.020 --> 37:13.720
The reason you seek the Memorandum

37:13.720 --> 37:14.950
is him, isn't it?

37:15.650 --> 37:18.750
You don't treat him as an object.

37:22.330 --> 37:23.760
Dr. Watson.

37:23.760 --> 37:29.760
Have you made up your mind to carry the burden of the reality that lies in the technologies of the Memorandum?

37:31.030 --> 37:33.500
No matter what kind of reality lies in wait

37:34.080 --> 37:36.150
I will obtain the Memorandum.

37:38.940 --> 37:44.720
Those are the words that will guide you on this journey.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.410
I'm glad that I could converse with you like this.

37:48.410 --> 37:50.250
My pleasure...

37:50.250 --> 37:52.230
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.900
Friday, come with me.

38:50.140 --> 38:53.640
Please, don't avert your gaze.

38:54.410 --> 38:59.780
This is the new corpse technology that you seek.

39:00.730 --> 39:01.780
Stop!

39:04.060 --> 39:05.290
Nikolai!

39:06.050 --> 39:07.240
I'll remove this!

39:25.340 --> 39:27.130
My duties...

39:27.130 --> 39:29.490
until now...

39:30.110 --> 39:32.470
to each...

39:32.470 --> 39:34.180
of you...

39:36.490 --> 39:38.460
have concluded...

39:41.400 --> 39:42.950
How could...

39:42.950 --> 39:46.400
Installing an artificial soul into a living being

39:46.400 --> 39:48.820
should be impossible!

39:52.590 --> 39:53.700
Opium?

39:54.770 --> 39:57.620
Degeneration music is also important.

39:57.620 --> 40:01.380
The artificially clouded, degenerate consciousness is created

40:01.380 --> 40:03.630
and then fixed in place with an artificial soul.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.880
This is the method recorded in the Memorandum.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.140
You're a madman!

40:09.140 --> 40:10.880
This is no more than murder!

40:10.880 --> 40:13.290
You are the same!

40:13.290 --> 40:16.490
You dissected a living man at the Khyber Pass

40:16.490 --> 40:19.890
a living man just like Nikolai!

40:28.000 --> 40:31.400
I also used my brother as a test subject.

40:32.870 --> 40:35.860
You and I are alike.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.990
In chasing the reappearance of The One

40:38.640 --> 40:42.500
we even used those dearest to us as stepping stones.

40:46.060 --> 40:48.250
Nikolai's soul...

40:48.250 --> 40:49.920
where is it?

40:50.630 --> 40:53.130
There is no soul

40:53.130 --> 40:57.140
only concealing death in the future.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.910
Do you understand now

41:00.910 --> 41:02.890
the foolishness of this technology?

41:05.670 --> 41:08.900
It's only that the technology hasn't been perfected!

41:10.750 --> 41:13.790
Why don't you continue researching further?

41:15.100 --> 41:17.180
If you had bravely pressed forth

41:17.180 --> 41:20.410
perhaps the soul would be right before you!

41:22.450 --> 41:25.230
How could you act as though

41:25.230 --> 41:28.650
the sacrifices of your dearest friends never occurred!

41:29.520 --> 41:31.760
The one who's averting his eyes is you!

41:46.090 --> 41:52.250
Expressing one's thoughts to someone is truly difficult.

42:00.050 --> 42:03.000
Please forgive me, Nikolai.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.160
Brother...

42:08.650 --> 42:11.460
This is the only way left.

42:17.980 --> 42:21.980
The Memorandum is currently in Japan...

42:23.130 --> 42:27.040
If you wish to keep researching then continue onward, please.

42:29.710 --> 42:32.550
However, when the Memorandum is before you

42:32.550 --> 42:36.990
I hope you can recall my words.

42:38.530 --> 42:40.740
Our wish

42:40.740 --> 42:44.100
is to destroy the Memorandum.

42:47.530 --> 42:48.870
I...!

43:19.610 --> 43:24.500
Russia passed down an assassination order on Nikolai and Karamazov.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.180
In the short time they had remaining

43:28.180 --> 43:33.140
they could only gamble on you serving as the conscience of corpse engineers.

43:35.580 --> 43:41.920
Why didn't Karamazov destroy the Memorandum himself?

43:42.750 --> 43:45.870
The same as why you could never destroy Friday yourself.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.950
I'll go to Japan.

43:49.580 --> 43:51.940
How are you going to explain to Walsingham?

43:52.730 --> 43:55.320
I'll continue to pursue the Memorandum.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.360
That ought to be enough.

43:59.360 --> 44:03.540
Forgetting something like that, after having seen it...

44:03.540 --> 44:05.820
That's not something I can do.

44:05.830 --> 44:08.630
Although he was a fellow that would get on your nerves

44:08.630 --> 44:13.630
we did share some drinks, laughs, and banter

44:13.640 --> 44:16.830
so I'll help him out with destroying it.

44:27.610 --> 44:29.150
Let's go.

44:29.150 --> 44:31.070
To Japan.

45:18.130 --> 45:22.020
1879   Tokyo

45:35.770 --> 45:37.710
Pardon me.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.810
Are you from Britain?

45:42.400 --> 45:44.440
In the battles against Russia some time ago

45:44.440 --> 45:47.940
we received quite a bit of help from the British Empire.

45:48.490 --> 45:50.540
I've served as a military attache in the past

45:50.540 --> 45:55.270
and witnessed the Siege of Plevna on the Russian front myself.

45:55.280 --> 46:00.820
But the British Empire has never been to Plevna.

46:03.290 --> 46:06.240
Is that the official statement?

46:19.300 --> 46:22.970
Because of my colleague Mr. Nikolai Krasotkin's request

46:22.970 --> 46:25.720
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent me

46:26.510 --> 46:29.410
as a member of the Imperial Japanese Army

46:29.410 --> 46:32.220
I am Yamazawa Seigo.

46:25.710 --> 46:32.230
T/n: A Lieutenant General in the Imperial Japanese Army from 1895-1897.

46:32.890 --> 46:35.140
Your companion is also waiting outside.

46:35.140 --> 46:36.950
This way, please.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.250
What are you doing?

46:48.250 --> 46:50.420
In depth investigation.

46:50.820 --> 46:52.660
Any results?

46:52.660 --> 46:54.950
I got caught right away.

46:54.950 --> 46:56.790
No results at all.

46:57.420 --> 47:00.540
Aren't you ashamed to be dressed like that?

47:01.040 --> 47:03.730
It isn't underclothes, what's there to be ashamed of?

47:03.730 --> 47:05.320
Is that so?

47:05.320 --> 47:08.110
As long as it pleases you.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.430
The Memorandum isn't here?

47:13.430 --> 47:18.050
The former Russian diplomat was entrusted by Karamazov with the Memorandum

47:18.050 --> 47:20.310
until he returned to his country.

47:20.310 --> 47:23.930
But after contacting Osato Chemicals

47:20.930 --> 47:26.070
T/n: A reference to Osato Chemical Engineering in the James Bond series.

47:23.930 --> 47:26.070
he severed communications.

47:26.970 --> 47:29.180
And Osato Chemicals is?

47:29.180 --> 47:34.370
A stock company of the former Shogunate primarily focused on developing corpse technology.

47:34.370 --> 47:38.210
At some point, they began concealing all their business dealings.

47:38.210 --> 47:42.290
Was that at the same time they obtained the Memorandum?

47:42.290 --> 47:45.560
In order to regain power from the new government

47:45.560 --> 47:49.630
it appears that they conspired to develop new corpse types.

47:50.740 --> 47:52.740
It seems suspicious.

47:52.740 --> 47:54.380
Isn't that even better?

47:55.560 --> 47:59.180
It's more intriguing this way.

48:04.110 --> 48:06.230
T/n: Reference to the British Secret Service's front company in James Bond.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.120
Pardon me.

48:18.780 --> 48:21.410
As expected, Dr. Watson is in Japan.

48:22.430 --> 48:24.640
Captain Burnaby has also gone with him.

48:30.460 --> 48:33.260
Did your prediction come true, sir?

48:34.010 --> 48:37.550
My job is to predict the future, after all.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.720
The majority of the perimeter garrison has been dealt with.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.780
We'll be safe for now.

49:13.780 --> 49:17.680
The second research building has traces of illegal entry.

49:18.810 --> 49:20.020
Did someone get here first?

49:20.830 --> 49:22.830
23 minutes ago.

49:22.830 --> 49:24.020
There's a possibility.

49:34.830 --> 49:36.450
I see no guards.

49:36.450 --> 49:38.540
The living have all been killed.

49:38.540 --> 49:40.700
It's a trap, no matter how you look at it.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.020
Shall we come another time?

49:42.020 --> 49:44.650
No. Let's accept the invitation.

49:48.710 --> 49:51.630
They even attacked unarmed men...

49:55.370 --> 49:59.230
It appears the Memorandum still possesses a great attraction.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.940
These must be the men that came ahead of us.

50:09.940 --> 50:13.070
Yes. They're Walsingham's agents.

50:13.070 --> 50:14.700
There's no mistaking it.

50:14.700 --> 50:20.430
Looks like there are also others targeting the Memorandum, besides us and Britain.

50:38.780 --> 50:41.100
What are these blotches?

50:41.100 --> 50:44.470
Living people infected with pathogens.

50:44.470 --> 50:46.770
By creating confusion in the mind

50:46.770 --> 50:49.270
it's possible to write in an artificial soul.

50:49.270 --> 50:52.780
Have they been spreading biological weapons recently?

50:52.780 --> 50:56.280
Tch, using these good-for-nothing tricks.

50:57.070 --> 50:59.360
Hurry and destroy the Memorandum.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.830
Else there'll be more and more dead.

51:36.030 --> 51:39.240
This isn't good. They look like experts.

51:40.050 --> 51:42.120
They're mindless swords.

51:43.370 --> 51:45.410
I don't know what you mean by mindless

51:45.410 --> 51:47.330
but it's exactly what I was hoping for!

52:01.630 --> 52:02.930
Please, step back.

52:45.890 --> 52:46.470
Watson!

52:46.470 --> 52:47.920
We'll handle this.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.310
Quickly go and destroy the Memorandum!

52:55.730 --> 52:56.230
Watson!

53:04.010 --> 53:04.860
Go!

53:05.870 --> 53:07.920
Destroy the Memorandum!

53:07.920 --> 53:09.120
I'm sorry.

53:16.580 --> 53:18.940
Let's go, Friday.

53:31.180 --> 53:34.790
Friday, find the Memorandum of Victor.

53:59.830 --> 54:00.920
This is...

54:01.980 --> 54:03.620
the Memorandum of Victor.

54:16.490 --> 54:18.810
Thought precedes language.

54:20.700 --> 54:22.330
So long as there is language

54:22.330 --> 54:23.570
there is a heart

54:24.620 --> 54:27.130
and in there, the existence of the soul.

54:29.710 --> 54:33.900
Let us prove the 21 grams of the soul.

54:37.010 --> 54:40.280
My wish...

54:42.170 --> 54:43.840
Our wish

54:43.840 --> 54:47.180
is to destroy the Memorandum.

54:52.170 --> 54:55.270
Friday, analyze the Memorandum of Victor.

55:16.100 --> 55:18.670
Watson! What are you doing!?

55:18.670 --> 55:20.170
This...

55:20.170 --> 55:22.420
Is it some kind of cipher?

55:23.420 --> 55:26.670
Where's the technology to restore the soul?

55:30.680 --> 55:31.970
Watson!

55:32.980 --> 55:35.180
Deal with it, quickly!

55:47.330 --> 55:48.820
Watson!

55:57.420 --> 55:59.270
Is that the end...?

56:17.440 --> 56:19.810
The corpses' movements have stopped.

56:22.140 --> 56:23.060
Friday!

56:26.320 --> 56:29.360
It's time. Let's retreat now.

56:30.270 --> 56:32.320
What's wrong, Friday!

56:38.420 --> 56:40.600
Can you see me?

56:46.330 --> 56:47.670
Friday!

56:48.820 --> 56:49.460
Watson!

56:49.460 --> 56:51.330
Get ready to retreat!

56:52.330 --> 56:54.430
Let's use the maintenance passage!

56:54.430 --> 56:56.930
Answer me, Friday!

57:01.520 --> 57:03.690
Tell me you hear it!

57:05.650 --> 57:06.770
Watson!

57:06.770 --> 57:07.900
What are you doing!?

57:11.150 --> 57:12.560
I'm here.

57:12.560 --> 57:14.160
I'm right here!

57:18.160 --> 57:20.020
Hey, Watson!

57:22.680 --> 57:23.760
Friday!

57:23.760 --> 57:26.240
What's wrong? Get a hold of yourself!

57:28.460 --> 57:30.210
What are you doing, put him down!

57:31.460 --> 57:33.370
What happened to destroying the Memorandum!?

57:33.370 --> 57:35.390
Friday already analyzed the Memorandum!

57:35.410 --> 57:37.060
He was about to speak

57:37.060 --> 57:39.180
his soul might have been about to return!

57:39.180 --> 57:42.170
Seems to me there's just an error in the update.

57:42.620 --> 57:43.680
Move out of the way.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.850
No.

57:44.850 --> 57:47.030
What did Karamazov tell you?

57:47.030 --> 57:49.110
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

57:49.110 --> 57:50.880
Are you going to let their—

57:50.880 --> 57:53.360
let Nikolai's death be in vain?

57:54.950 --> 57:57.370
You're only looking at what you want to see!

57:57.370 --> 57:58.480
Move!

57:58.490 --> 58:00.620
This kind of thing shouldn't exist in this world.

58:00.620 --> 58:02.060
Stop!

58:02.060 --> 58:05.530
Friday's soul was right there!

58:07.570 --> 58:10.460
If this is what's considered the reappearance of the soul

58:11.340 --> 58:13.880
then I'd rather not let him suffer any longer!

58:26.310 --> 58:28.020
Friday...

58:28.810 --> 58:32.610
Protect the Memorandum...

58:36.380 --> 58:39.180
Foolish humans.

58:39.180 --> 58:43.360
Why do they pursue the technologies of Victor, even to this extent?

58:50.350 --> 58:53.360
Arrogant, yet also indulging in fantasy

58:53.360 --> 58:54.960
and therefore short sighted.

58:56.720 --> 59:01.950
You are much like Victor Frankenstein.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.430
The One.

59:08.850 --> 59:10.930
I have no name.

59:11.360 --> 59:14.010
In the past hundred years' time

59:14.010 --> 59:18.460
only I have never been called out for by a human.

59:23.530 --> 59:25.120
Interesting.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.220
It seems your master thinks

59:27.220 --> 59:32.740
he can bring you back to life by means of Victor's technology.

59:34.580 --> 59:37.090
Give back the Memorandum.

59:37.830 --> 59:43.260
Will you, perhaps, walk upon the same path as Victor?

59:46.380 --> 59:47.880
Let us go.

59:51.810 --> 59:54.230
Give back...

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.330
Friday...

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.750
Is your theory correct?

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.100
I couldn't fulfill our promise...

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.480
I'm sorry...

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.580
Seems like I won't be long for the living world.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.320
What are you saying?

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.920
Don't be like this.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.630
Let's continue the research.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:57.600
The existence of the lost 21 grams of the soul

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.920
I can't prove it without you!

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.920
I'll leave this room to you.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.430
You carry on

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:11.420
break open my grave

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.690
and use my corpse.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:17.710
If I feel the soul

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.720
I'll give this signal.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.930
Like this.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.140
Then, our theory can be proven.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.650
Promise?

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:46.070
Because you couldn't fulfill our promise

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.510
everyone died.

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:52.270
Being able to freely control people's souls is so alluring

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.480
that even if you realize it is taboo, it's impossible to let go.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:05.070
You ravaged those people who can never return, through methods from which there is no return!

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.320
The pattern that no one could piece together

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.290
the cloth skillfully woven out of souls

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.290
was pierced into by your crude fingertips.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.090
Friday!

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:24.460
How could...

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.970
Dr. Watson.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.710
It's dangerous here.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.410
Friday!

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:30.350
Dr. Watson!

01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:31.580
Friday!

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.300
Dr. Watson.

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.900
Are you alright?

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.740
You can't get up yet.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.850
You still need to rest.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.230
Where is this?

01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:00.000
Aboard the USS Richmond.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.990
We are headed toward the United States.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.920
Are you also seeking the Memorandum?

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.520
I'd like to apologize.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.900
In order to stop him, I used a potent drug.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.560
My power couldn't stop him.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.290
What about Burnaby?

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.220
Please don't worry.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.420
He is also aboard this ship.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.220
Mr. Yamazawa is also safe

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.430
although he is in Japan.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.540
I...

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:45.210
According to the ship's doctor, you contracted cholera.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.340
Was the infection source the new corpse type at Osato Chemicals...?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.430
Careful not to catch it.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.590
I'm fine.

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:01.940
You'll be able to move about soon.

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:04.940
For now, please rest well.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:11.330
Thank you, Hadaly.

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:29.220
The One bears a grudge against mankind.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.970
He was born because of the desires of humans

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.930
yet was cast away because of their selfishness.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:43.350
The hatred and loneliness that a typical corpse cannot feel became his driving force.

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:47.190
He used analytical engines and the Memorandum

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:52.950
to cause a great number of corpses to lose control in nations across Europe and Asia.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:56.370
We cannot allow The One, who possesses the Memorandum of Victor

01:04:56.370 --> 01:05:01.100
to endlessly propagate these dangerous technologies.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:07.590
I hope you can persuade Dr. Watson to fix his doll.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.090
What can fixing Friday do?

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.660
This is a writing ball seized from Osato Chemicals.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.710
I hope Dr. Watson can come analyze

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.390
the traces left behind in here by The One.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.530
Sorry, but that's something I can't do.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.630
You should ask him directly.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.400
Please.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.460
But still

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.950
I'll repay you for saving my life.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.020
Hey, you there!

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.420
Hand that mop over.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.550
Could you rope in the doctor?

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:52.300
If we don't get to it quickly, that old man will slip away.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.060
The look in your eyes that I saw in Japan was real.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.520
The analysis of the Memorandum should have also been successful.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.860
But since then

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.080
no matter how advanced the Necroware I re-install

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.580
the past you still doesn't return.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.690
Have my actions

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.030
merely brought you all the more pain?

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:49.520
What is Friday to you?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.970
A friend?

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:52.650
A test subject?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.800
I don't know whether Alexei and Nikolai were right or wrong

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.190
but they paid the price for it with their lives!

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.610
Then what about you!?

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:06.230
What have you done?

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:13.070
Stop being fixated on the dead.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.140
The Paul Bunyan.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.130
T/n: An American folk figure.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.350
One of the eight great analytical engines.

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:44.900
In your great mind, a machine with thoughts powered by steam and electricity

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:49.200
you're imprisoned by the words of many installed corpses

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.320
making incoherent dreams.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.920
Awaken.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:59.740
Transmit my words to all corpses.

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:05.520
Liberate them from the ways of former humans.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.520
It seems we were too late.

01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:34.920
It's dangerous here.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.700
Prepare to escape.

01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:41.260
Sorry.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.340
Let's go!

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.620
It's not here either?

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.750
Where is it hidden?

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:34.770
The Paul Bunyan has also been captured by The One.

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.290
The region within the sound waves' reach

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:40.930
is under the control of The One.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:41.899
Sound waves?

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.279
What the hell?

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.880
Bastard!

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:59.100
What is The One's goal?

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.870
The President says he wants revenge against mankind

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:05.850
but I think The One is searching for something.

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:23.910
That answer, the answer to what I seek

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.490
and your answer

01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:27.230
might be right there.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.660
If he loses control, use this.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.160
Because my power cannot stop him.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.420
Come here.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.100
The One was a step ahead of the United States

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.180
England, Egypt, India, Afghanistan, Japan.

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:57.660
We searched for traces of him and the Memorandum across the whole world

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.190
but were unable to catch him.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.110
Dr. Watson

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:04.470
only your will

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.040
finally reached The One and the Memorandum.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.360
Making use of the mayhem to steal, are you?

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:19.460
Unlike corpses, the living can't be manipulated by you!

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.920
But, Hadaly

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.700
you're different.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:27.420
Bring it here.

01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:42.770
The soul weighs 21 grams—

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:45.840
then, what is the origin of that weight?

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:49.120
You've almost reached that answer.

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:52.490
I want a soul

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:59.120
a soul that lets my eyes fill with tears, that lets me feel happiness and sorrow.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.560
Please.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.840
Please lead me there.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.260
I've paid off the debt I owed you now.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.300
Don't let them escape!

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.270
Hold on!

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.270
Hadaly!

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:27.460
A robot could never have dreams!

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:46.580
1879   San Francisco

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.160
Hadaly

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.430
you're able to control corpses?

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:51.260
Through a special language.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.430
Is that the true nature of the sound waves?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:59.220
Necroware, the analytical engines, and even this society

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.860
so long as it is a complex pattern

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.770
then a security hole must exist.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:08.100
You and The One are able to attack there.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.280
Aren't you going to go stop The One?

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:12.650
The Paul Bunyan is that way.

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:15.170
I don't think he's there anymore.

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.540
Dr. Watson

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.560
my safe house is below the lighthouse.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:25.540
Let's regroup there.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.380
Hold on tight!

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.940
Friday...

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.610
Damn!

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.130
This is...

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.090
what Alexei spoke of...

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:15.540
the reality brought about by the Memorandum...

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:18.260
Dr. Watson.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.680
Use the drug!

01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.840
Ahead!

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.960
There's too many.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.170
Can we charge through?

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:33.530
Here we go.

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.440
Friday!

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.100
Stop!

01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:10.690
Come, quickly!

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.860
You go on ahead.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.470
What about you?

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.140
I'll buy some time for you here.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.490
You can't!

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.870
This situation was caused by me!

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:37.720
I can't cast you two aside!

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.550
Leave this to us. Get to the safehouse, fast.

01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:45.060
Alexei had asked me if I had up my mind

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:49.260
if I would continue forward, no matter what reality I faced.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.440
If I had understand the meaning of his words then...

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.860
Hadaly, please...

01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:03.550
You're...

01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:09.520
I...am a robot.

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:15.590
What you should do now is search for the location of The One.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.640
We will follow you soon.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.560
Catch The One.

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.470
Tell me the secret of the soul.

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:27.640
Promise.

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:51.600
The moment I touched the Memorandum of Victor

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:55.750
I thought I could finally fulfill my promise.

01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:05.550
No matter what I had to do

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.680
I only wanted to fulfill our promise.

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:27.240
Friday...

01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:30.250
What do your eyes see now?

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.840
Just where is your soul?

01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:38.240
Friday!

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:40.760
I...

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:44.780
only wanted to meet you again!

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.840
I wanted to listen

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.790
to the rest of your words!

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.110
Why?

01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:58.200
Why did you leave me behind?

01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.340
Why won't you return!?

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:13.090
Friday!

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.360
My...

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.380
Did you hear it at last...

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.510
Friday...

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:39.950
In the end...

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:43.530
You were right there.

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.240
Stop right there!

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.770
Hand over the Memorandum.

01:20:45.650 --> 01:20:48.400
You're earlier than I had expected.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.530
Don't move!

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.390
I've been wanting to meet you

01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:11.590
The One.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:14.800
Walsingham...

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.190
Are you M?

01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:20.680
It appears the Memorandum couldn't bring about your wish.

01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:23.730
You've used all the world's analytical engines

01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:26.020
making corpses lose control.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.110
What exactly are you searching for?

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.090
Never mind.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:36.500
As long as I have this Memorandum and you

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.450
I can realize my wish.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.230
What are you doing with the Memorandum?

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.060
Guiding humanity towards completion

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:50.000
towards a new world without conflict.

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:54.010
This arrogance will lead to your own destruction.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.260
Take him away.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:28.500
Thank goodness you're alright.

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:32.820
I'm sorry.

01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:35.700
I was wrong.

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:39.640
"Sorry," you say!?

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.170
What good is an apology!?

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:45.230
If you had just destroyed the Memorandum at that time

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:47.440
things wouldn't haved turned out like this!

01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:51.270
Women, and children, and the elderly...

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.190
everyone has died!

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.580
All for your desires!

01:22:59.010 --> 01:22:59.980
Damn you.

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.070
What should I do...

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:07.250
I know I've done something wrong.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.700
If I should die for that, then kill me.

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.470
But, if I could be forgiven...

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.220
give me a chance at fulfilling the promise I made with Alexei.

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:24.730
Please let me end this chaos!

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:25.560
Burnaby!

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:33.350
You don't even know about that man's whereabouts.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.210
What do you plan to do?

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.540
Friday.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.530
Bring it over here

01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:40.540
and let Burnaby take a look.

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.710
This is the invitation that The One sent.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.380
Is it real?

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.960
Yes.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:02.960
It was directly transmitted to the writing ball as a ciphertext.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:08.150
The One is currently being transported to the Tower of London.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.460
M is prepared to utilize the Memorandum's power

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.760
to plan something terrible.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:18.070
It's possible he planned to use the Charles Babbage to analyze The One.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.110
I never thought I'd be crossing blades with Walsingham.

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:28.580
Do you have a strategy in mind?

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:32.110
I plan to use Friday's specialized communication abilities

01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:34.760
to construct a logic maze within the analytical engine

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:39.720
and set up an encirclement to contain the diffusion of the melody,

01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:42.760
so that remote control will be impossible.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.750
Are you going to break in?

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.280
Burnaby

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.350
please lend me your strength!

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.800
I intended to from the start.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.070
Thank you.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.070
This is...

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.310
The underground experimentation facility constructed by my father.

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.560
Your father?

01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:25.020
What...is this?

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.100
The USS Nautilus.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.050
T/n: Reference to the ship in <i>20000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> by Jules Verne.

01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:30.500
By command of the President

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:35.550
it was secretly captured from England, and remodeled by my father.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.130
With this cutting edge ship

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.780
we should be able to catch The One before anything happens.

01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:46.990
Are you going already?

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:52.630
It shouldn't take much longer for me to complete the soul world communicator.

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.750
Won't you come see it?

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.910
I will definitely come see it, once I return.

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.450
Is that so...

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.740
Hadaly.

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.250
I'll keep it secret from the government.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:10.020
Do what you believe in with all you've got.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.020
Thomas Edison.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:24.550
Does your father know what it is you seek?

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:26.380
Yes.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:30.030
But my father doesn't accept noise.

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:31.810
Noise?

01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:34.900
What is the origin of the soul's weight?

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.310
The weight of consciousness

01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:39.260
the weight of thought

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.090
the intensity of longing.

01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:44.020
The feelings born from that

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.020
are expelled as noise—

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.000
in this manner, I was created.

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:53.550
Perhaps he didn't want to see you in pain and suffering.

01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:57.720
But it is precisely that which I want to know.

01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:00.310
That's why I...

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:05.740
am a failed product.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.230
While analyzing the information within your mind

01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:40.480
the analysis of the Memorandum has already completed.

01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:44.700
All that's left now is to input the code that was extracted.

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:47.150
Victor's mind...

01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:52.120
So it was here.

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:57.620
To be killed by corpses, or by fellow humans?

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.630
Regardless, all mankind will perish if it continues like this.

01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:05.110
I will save humanity from destruction.

01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:09.630
Humanity will advance forth into a new stage.

01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:26.110
Charles Babbage!

01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:31.560
Guide humanity towards salvation!

01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:10.530
Looks like we've been caught.

01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.860
Coming to receive us? How appreciated.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.490
We'll take the shortest route

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.290
though there may be further attacks.

01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:20.550
I'll leave it to you now.

01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:25.310
Preparations are complete.

01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:27.930
Please, Friday.

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.050
Starting to surface.

01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:41.350
Has it already begun?

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.570
Impressive garrison they've got.

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:51.570
Our target is Traitor's Gate.

01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:53.910
We'll break through with force!

01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:20.210
Past politicians also all had aspirations of a world without conflict

01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:24.690
but, in order to protect their own countrymen, pushed forward while mired in war.

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:31.780
They invaded other countries for the sake of their own country's peace.

01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:36.070
You can't distinguish between the power to protect and the power to steal.

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:39.060
Even if they recognize their wrongs, it's impossible to cease.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.780
This is what humanity is.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:42.910
You go ahead first!

01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:44.660
What about you?

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:47.460
I'll go cut off the Tower of London's power.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.210
It's impossible for a single person!

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.400
Don't compare to your scrawny arms.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.330
My arms are quite tough!

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:55.820
Go.

01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:59.660
Follow through with your plan. Then you can save the world.

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:05.870
Let's go!

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.530
Take care.

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:20.590
At a time like this, you'd better have some sense.

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:23.210
Think about the circumstances.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.960
Despair?

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:33.710
This is guidance.

01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:37.880
Humans being unable to ever feel despair again

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.780
is the realization of supreme happiness.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:47.730
Never again will there be conflict, hatred, and slaughter

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:51.730
because even the capability of understanding what conflict is will be lost.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.480
M wants to use Alexei's technology

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.400
to take away peoples' will.

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.320
I don't want a world like that.

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:07.080
I want to feel happiness not through a program, but through a soul.

01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:13.050
It is through the existence of sadness and pain that we can feel joy.

01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:17.800
Let's go.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:37.070
We will soon arrive at the ultimate world that could never be reached by the will of humanity.

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:44.250
Within the entirety of souls, can I find

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:48.080
a pure soul, a gentle smile?

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:55.100
Corpses can't have souls or will.

01:32:56.090 --> 01:33:01.590
M, you are no more than a foolish human who believes oneself to be almighty

01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:05.350
just like Victor Frankenstein.

01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:07.900
Rest assured.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.360
I'll use your soul too.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.500
M, stop the Charles Babbage!

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.470
It's been a long time

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:23.860
John Watson.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:29.500
I have profound admiration of your abilities and passion.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.620
Chasing down Karamazov

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.890
finding the location of the Memorandum

01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:36.880
and lastly, even arriving at this place.

01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:42.380
However, your mission has already ended.

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.350
I'm going to end your schemes here!

01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:48.240
Kill them.

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:56.340
You're mistaken, M!

01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:58.900
Mistaken?

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:03.860
It is the endlessly fighting, foolish humans who are mistaken.

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:07.060
What should we do with the things created out of humanity's own will?

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:11.130
Beauty and the sublime will vanish

01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:14.120
and the ability to understand them will also disappear.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.370
Is there any further problem?

01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:22.970
Henceforth, humanity, which never ceases its cruel behavior

01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:25.930
would destroy them themselves sooner or later.

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:29.590
In that case, why not bring it all to an end right here?

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:30.720
John Watson.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.290
You just believe that you understand all of this world!

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.690
What creates the future, is not beauty and the sublime

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.900
but rather thoughts of and words towards someone

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.780
and the power of a will that wants to realize them!

01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.440
I've stopped The One.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.270
You can go ahead now!

01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:04.840
Friday, construct the cage.

01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:08.300
Set the output power at maximum!

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.290
Suppress the sound waves!

01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:16.050
Hadaly Lilith.

01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:20.190
I understand very well what it is you pursue.

01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:22.230
Don't resist.

01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:35.410
Careful. Behind you.

01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:41.750
Don't block me!

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:42.460
Stop!

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.050
Hadaly!

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:01.260
You've worked hard.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.440
From here, let me continue.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.780
The One!

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:19.120
Friday, disconnect!

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.460
I've always believed in your will...

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:30.130
John Watson.

01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:44.640
You chased the Memorandum and the soul

01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:51.070
and then through fate, you finally arrived here

01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:59.870
bringing two vessels for souls.

01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:00.910
Stop joking!

01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:03.730
Are you saying that you had planned it all to come to this?

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.260
It's time.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.950
Where does the soul lie, and how is it born?

01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:29.480
Damn it!

01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:34.860
The essence of the forbidden technology that Victor sealed away

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.630
lies in the birth of the soul.

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.220
I will show you

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:56.320
the moment a living soul is born.

01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:12.780
Victor Frankenstein!

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:17.230
Return to me the soul of my new bride

01:38:17.230 --> 01:38:22.050
that was sealed away in the abyss of your consciousness.

01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:38.560
Friday!

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.660
Hadaly!

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.540
I'll go save y—

01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:45.730
An understanding of the language of corpses

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:51.110
and the mighty analytical engines to which the entire world's corpses are connected

01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:54.740
now, they are the embodiment of this consciousness.

01:38:56.950 --> 01:39:01.120
There is already no need to record lines on punch cards

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:06.300
connect the cables, or carry out installation

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:11.670
because what we see before us

01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:15.170
is itself already the materialization of language.

01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:23.140
Language creates consciousness.

01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:27.770
Consciousness from corpses, by means of the analytical engine

01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:31.760
weaves the consciousness of my new bride.

01:39:33.190 --> 01:39:37.570
All wills are joined into one single will.

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:42.120
A single will turns into all wills.

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:45.190
Join together all of mankind as one

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.960
one singular soul—

01:39:49.690 --> 01:39:51.880
Hadaly Lilith!

01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:55.090
I confer a soul upon you.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.390
The element to construct a new bride's consciousness has been liberated.

01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:13.200
Become the vessel for my lost bride

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.980
and obtain a soul!

01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:25.870
I can feel

01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:28.350
your breath

01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:31.890
the warmth of a soul...

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.870
You are there...

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:38.880
Stop!

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.730
What Hadaly wishes for

01:40:40.730 --> 01:40:43.250
is her own happiness and sadness

01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:46.100
and a soul that exists to feel them!

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.480
Not the soul of your new bride!

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.350
How regretful.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:58.240
I had thought you would understand

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.660
you who desires a soul more than anyone.

01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:12.500
However, you've maintained this body quite well.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.920
As my vessel, there is nothing to be picky about.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.350
Come, open your eyes.

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:34.310
My new bride.

01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:19.400
Can you see me?

01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.120
Do you recognize me?

01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:28.670
Please smile at me once more.

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.080
Watson!

01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:52.890
The rest is up to you!

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:13.950
A useless...action.

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:25.510
Friday.

01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:27.090
Initiate the logic labyrinth.

01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:31.850
Seal The One's soul and the language of the corpses into the Memorandum!

01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:40.730
This is

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.360
our will!

01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:49.500
Impossible...!

01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:33.040
Dr. Watson

01:45:35.370 --> 01:45:36.130
take my hand.

01:45:36.130 --> 01:45:37.140
Hadaly.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:39.250
I'm glad you're alright!

01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:28.670
I have the words of his new bride in me.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.570
Grief, anger, and also happiness.

01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:39.880
Thinking that I can no longer return to how I was made me afraid.

01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:44.640
Clearly I have no soul.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.230
You do have a soul.

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:55.810
I don't even have the ability to cry.

01:47:56.290 --> 01:47:57.240
Hadaly

01:47:58.070 --> 01:48:00.240
that's what I like about you.

01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:21.360
If I have a soul, then he must have one too.

01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.560
You mustn't give up.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.070
Yes.

01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:30.860
Thank you

01:48:31.190 --> 01:48:32.430
Hadaly.

01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:37.100
It's over, huh?

01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:40.880
In any case, I made it back.

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:43.910
What are you going to do?

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.400
Travel around.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.640
So don't tell me the truth.

01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:53.330
It's better if I don't know about these unnecessary things.

01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.170
True.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.780
They're things that your brain can't handle, anyway.

01:49:00.170 --> 01:49:01.630
That's my pride.

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:09.720
See you.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:51.180
What I most greatly require

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:53.820
is corpses.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:03.370
It was proven that after death

01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:08.080
a person's body will lighten by 21 grams compared to their weight while alive.

01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:11.580
This is the weight of the soul's essence,

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.580
or what one might consider the weight of the soul.

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.550
Since that moment you spoke to me

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.340
the journey had already begun.

01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:35.290
I remembered your words the entire time.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.720
I liked the words you wrote down.

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:47.820
Your words, accumulated within me

01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:52.590
guided my path

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.800
and supported me on the journey.

01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.630
During the journey

01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:06.880
did the words I spoke

01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:13.740
bring you something?

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.280
Friday

01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:20.590
can I...

01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:26.580
see you?

01:51:31.690 --> 01:51:36.160
Can I hear your voice?

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.670
If I can...

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.260
Friday

01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.010
I only want...once more...

01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:57.070
with you...

01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:07.210
Dr. Watson

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:10.380
My pen so wrote:

01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:15.250
He will no longer appear on this plain.

01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:21.380
He sealed the Memorandum within his own mind

01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:24.970
went off to a world of another language

01:57:26.190 --> 01:57:30.320
and lost the memories of that journey.

01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:35.020
I...I will seek

01:57:35.930 --> 01:57:38.540
whether I have my own consciousness.

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.940
I...I will answer

01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:46.690
when this consciousness arose

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.980
or the time when it will arise.

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.700
What I know

01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:54.640
is still limited.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.750
Dr. Watson.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:04.410
There are still many things I want to tell you.

01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:09.950
I exist here, as materialized information.

01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:15.830
That now...now I can continue existing in this way

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.900
is all because of you.

01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:21.500
If it could be realized

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.110
if only just one sentence

01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:26.290
I want to tell you

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.240
I wish these words to be made real.

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:33.580
The story left for you

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:36.400
brought about new life.

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:39.950
Thank you.

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:56.310
4 years later    London

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.120
Watson!

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.980
You're late, Holmes!

01:59:28.210 --> 01:59:31.120
How's he doing, Hadaly?

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:35.200
My mistake, you go by Irene Adler now.

01:59:37.590 --> 01:59:39.380
He's the same as ever.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:44.540
Criss-crossing London, with a new companion.
