00:59.360 --> 01:00.528
Emily!

01:09.331 --> 01:10.332
Defense!

01:10.415 --> 01:11.041
Defense!

01:22.429 --> 01:24.306
Do you need a ride?

01:24.390 --> 01:25.474
No.

01:25.557 --> 01:26.725
I'm all right.

02:56.914 --> 03:01.752
Mom, I'm home!

03:18.398 --> 03:19.190
Mom?

03:24.279 --> 03:25.197
Hey, oh, one sec.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.991
Oh, no, no, no, come
in, come in, come in.

03:29.077 --> 03:30.286
Is everything okay?

03:30.370 --> 03:31.621
Yeah, everything's
fine, Emily just got back.

03:31.704 --> 03:33.206
Yeah, good.

03:33.289 --> 03:35.251
I need to stay for another hour.

03:35.334 --> 03:37.211
Yeah, that's fine,
I'll see you in a bit.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.171
Bye.

03:41.133 --> 03:44.385
Uh, oh...

03:47.932 --> 03:49.142
What? I didn't say it.

03:51.602 --> 03:54.814
Your, your mom had to work.

03:54.898 --> 03:56.108
She'll be home late,

03:56.190 --> 03:58.444
so she said that we
should eat without her.

03:58.527 --> 04:01.447
Tah-dah!

04:01.531 --> 04:03.492
Is my cooking that bad?

04:03.575 --> 04:05.911
No, not at all.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.581
Mm,
so how was school?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.509
That's lovely, Em, I'll
read it after dinner.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.263
It's, uh, it's almost ready.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.558
So shower up and then we'll eat.

04:47.668 --> 04:52.383
I saw a beautiful butterfly
today, you would've loved her.

04:57.472 --> 05:00.600
I wish you were here
to teach me the lay up.

05:00.682 --> 05:02.476
I'm doing everything
Coach told me to do,

05:02.559 --> 05:04.354
but it just doesn't work.

05:27.966 --> 05:29.925
- All done?
- Mm-hm.

05:30.009 --> 05:31.845
- Homework done?
- Yes.

05:31.927 --> 05:33.388
Okay then, off to bed.

05:35.974 --> 05:37.809
I'll be there to
tuck you in in a sec.

07:39.411 --> 07:40.161
Emily?

07:42.706 --> 07:46.169
You know your mom
doesn't want you in here.

07:56.805 --> 07:57.765
Sorry!

07:57.849 --> 07:58.849
Sorry I'm late!

08:03.021 --> 08:04.522
What're you doing?

08:05.982 --> 08:08.359
I'm sorry, I was
just calling Emily.

08:08.443 --> 08:10.529
Emily, you know you're
not allowed in here.

08:10.613 --> 08:12.156
I'm sorry.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.658
- No, just leave it, please.
- I, I just wanted...

08:13.742 --> 08:16.496
Just stop!

08:19.748 --> 08:22.211
Please, just leave,
I'll take care of it.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.557
Mom?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.558
Go to your room, Emily.

08:55.998 --> 08:57.751
Has everything been all right?

08:57.835 --> 08:58.794
Yeah.

08:58.878 --> 08:59.963
Emily's such a doll.

09:02.758 --> 09:04.259
She wrote a beautiful essay.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.433
I'm sorry about the library.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.352
Oh, think nothing of it.

09:14.438 --> 09:15.814
My husband made those drawings.

09:17.775 --> 09:21.697
And all of the stories I wrote
spawned from his drawings.

09:28.537 --> 09:30.205
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.040
Yeah.

09:32.459 --> 09:33.210
Goodnight.

11:03.857 --> 11:08.612
"F-A-U-N-U-T-Land.

11:08.697 --> 11:09.655
"Faunutland.

11:15.746 --> 11:16.747
"Nightinglar."

11:19.876 --> 11:22.003
So your name is Nightinglar.

11:41.485 --> 11:45.781
Wow.

16:00.661 --> 16:01.328
Hello?

16:01.411 --> 16:02.120
Small human.

16:16.138 --> 16:16.888
Hello?

16:17.932 --> 16:19.100
I surrender!

16:23.063 --> 16:23.813
Excuse me.

16:27.443 --> 16:28.443
I mean you no harm.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.320
Please.

16:31.488 --> 16:32.824
I mean you no harm.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.123
I shouldn't.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.422
Could it be?

16:51.679 --> 16:52.430
No.

17:04.486 --> 17:05.320
It's you.

17:08.325 --> 17:09.617
Greetedness, small one.

17:13.747 --> 17:14.915
My name is Nightinglar.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.375
Hi.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.169
I'm Emily.

17:20.547 --> 17:21.632
Oh, the cloud berries.

17:33.229 --> 17:35.022
Here you go.

17:35.105 --> 17:35.856
Thank you.

17:45.951 --> 17:47.202
You're a child.

17:49.412 --> 17:54.377
Yeah.

18:02.094 --> 18:03.721
Come, we have to go!

18:03.806 --> 18:06.475
It's getting dark and these
woods aren't safe at night.

18:11.439 --> 18:12.190
No, wait!

18:13.232 --> 18:15.403
That bridge is a death trap!

18:15.486 --> 18:17.613
This way, come come!

18:36.801 --> 18:37.552
Can you fly?

18:42.475 --> 18:44.520
Nightinglar, can you fly?

18:47.899 --> 18:48.649
No.

18:49.609 --> 18:51.152
Not anymore.

18:52.403 --> 18:53.237
We're here!

18:56.618 --> 18:57.368
Come come!

19:00.787 --> 19:01.455
Wait!

19:12.676 --> 19:13.636
Nightinglar?

19:18.768 --> 19:20.019
Nightinglar?

19:20.103 --> 19:22.064
In here!

19:34.453 --> 19:35.370
Nightinglar?

19:44.631 --> 19:46.883
Come come!

20:00.024 --> 20:00.775
But how?

20:01.985 --> 20:03.195
Just move the roots!

20:08.993 --> 20:10.619
Come come, this is where I live.

20:16.918 --> 20:18.253
Come come.

20:28.182 --> 20:30.852
Come come, let me
introduce you to...

20:32.437 --> 20:33.813
So?

20:33.898 --> 20:36.024
My very good friend.

20:41.072 --> 20:42.282
No, no, no, no!

20:44.576 --> 20:46.453
Wait, Emily, Emily, don't!

20:50.334 --> 20:51.043
Stop!

20:58.675 --> 21:01.553
Emily, this is Belorac.

21:01.638 --> 21:06.185
He's a Kapal, a very kind
and loving friend of mine.

21:06.268 --> 21:08.688
Belorac, this is...

21:10.606 --> 21:12.107
No, she's not a demon.

21:15.445 --> 21:17.447
No, she's not a shrunken human.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.954
She's a child!

21:22.037 --> 21:22.788
Huh?

21:23.621 --> 21:24.455
Hmm.

21:26.125 --> 21:26.876
Come come!

21:28.753 --> 21:29.503
I'm stuck.

21:32.174 --> 21:32.925
Oh.

21:34.592 --> 21:37.595
There you go, come come.

21:37.679 --> 21:39.473
Don't mind her looks,
she can't help it.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.987
He wants to say hi, he's
just a little scared.

21:53.282 --> 21:54.574
You don't have to be afraid.

21:57.662 --> 21:58.954
Belorac!

22:11.595 --> 22:12.470
My name's Emily.

22:35.706 --> 22:37.373
He said his name is Belorac.

22:39.835 --> 22:41.503
Belorac.

22:41.588 --> 22:43.340
What a beautiful name.

22:44.799 --> 22:46.551
Well, now that that's settled!

22:48.137 --> 22:49.679
Cloudberry soup!

22:49.764 --> 22:50.556
Let's eat!

23:43.368 --> 23:44.120
"Children.

23:46.788 --> 23:50.543
"Children are a small
form of human beings.

23:51.795 --> 23:55.548
"They have the ability
of great compassion,

23:55.632 --> 23:58.635
"vivid imagination
and curiosity.

24:01.681 --> 24:05.059
"They can see worlds
full of magic.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.479
"Worlds that humans can't see.

24:10.399 --> 24:14.821
"This is why humans
are afraid of children

24:14.905 --> 24:17.532
"and deem them very dangerous."

24:20.036 --> 24:20.661
Listen to this.

24:22.121 --> 24:25.750
"Humans train children to
become more like humans.

24:34.928 --> 24:39.225
"Nothing can stop
their imagination.

24:39.308 --> 24:40.684
"Not even fear."

24:44.230 --> 24:45.607
She can save us!

24:49.319 --> 24:50.363
Yes, it does!

24:57.413 --> 24:59.499
I know she doesn't
understand you,

25:01.084 --> 25:02.711
but she must be a child.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.342
I have an idea.

25:11.053 --> 25:12.179
She's waking up.

25:21.399 --> 25:23.025
What are you doing?

25:24.235 --> 25:25.653
We're watching you sleep!

25:28.741 --> 25:30.243
You wanna see something cool?

25:32.287 --> 25:33.288
Okay?

25:33.371 --> 25:38.169
Yeah!

25:38.253 --> 25:41.464
It's, up.

25:41.547 --> 25:42.298
Come come!

25:47.638 --> 25:48.764
My noble lady.

25:50.433 --> 25:53.478
What would you like
to endeavor upon?

25:53.562 --> 25:56.983
What does
"endeavor upon" mean?

25:57.066 --> 25:58.401
I don't know!

25:58.483 --> 26:00.278
What would you like to do?

26:00.361 --> 26:02.656
I don't know,
what are my choices?

26:02.740 --> 26:03.781
I'm so glad you asked.

26:05.033 --> 26:05.783
Okay.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.170
Bounce with the Block Monster.

26:26.559 --> 26:27.268
A monster?

26:29.145 --> 26:30.939
A kind kind of monster.

26:48.209 --> 26:52.965
Or would you like to...

26:53.047 --> 26:55.217
Run with a Glukar Warrior?

27:45.191 --> 27:49.322
Why do you carry
around all that stuff?

27:49.404 --> 27:52.116
You never know
when you'll need it.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.870
And by the way, the
most insignificant thing

27:54.952 --> 27:56.623
can make a great difference.

28:00.667 --> 28:01.794
Here.

28:07.259 --> 28:11.765
Would you like to fly in the
wind with my fellow Fellicans?

28:29.243 --> 28:31.079
Now choose wisely.

28:31.161 --> 28:33.623
These are the last
of their kind.

28:37.044 --> 28:37.962
I want to...

28:41.423 --> 28:42.341
Fly in the wind.

28:42.424 --> 28:43.970
Excellent choice!

29:01.030 --> 29:01.948
Oh!

29:02.031 --> 29:02.741
Thanks.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.006
Perfect conditions.

29:43.748 --> 29:44.498
Go ahead.

29:50.212 --> 29:51.213
Step onto them.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.343
What do you mean?

29:54.425 --> 29:55.927
I can't.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.556
I can't stand on butterflies.

29:58.639 --> 30:00.974
Oh, but you see, these
aren't butterflies.

30:01.059 --> 30:02.770
These are Fellicans.

30:02.852 --> 30:04.395
If you let them,
they'll carry you.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.483
Just use your imagination
to guide them.

30:22.124 --> 30:22.875
Go ahead.

30:27.256 --> 30:28.006
Try again.

30:38.478 --> 30:40.522
Just calm down and try again.

30:41.981 --> 30:42.691
Oh.

30:58.710 --> 30:59.836
I can't do it!

31:01.547 --> 31:02.756
Yes, you can.

31:03.965 --> 31:05.551
You're just trying too hard.

31:07.427 --> 31:09.221
So what do you want
me to do, try less?

31:10.931 --> 31:11.682
Yes!

31:14.102 --> 31:16.813
There is an old
legend that says,

31:16.897 --> 31:19.317
"with love in your heart,

31:19.399 --> 31:22.696
"a smile on your face,"

31:25.239 --> 31:27.075
you have to smile
with your eyes, too.

31:28.369 --> 31:31.414
"And the courage to dream,
anything is possible.

31:32.958 --> 31:35.085
"Love, laugh, imagine."

31:37.422 --> 31:39.507
Here, this will help you.

31:40.842 --> 31:42.177
This is a thing.

31:44.012 --> 31:45.555
And a thing is
from another world.

31:47.724 --> 31:50.186
Legend says it has
magical powers.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.319
Mm-hm.

32:02.242 --> 32:05.162
You might just be
a child after all.

32:13.338 --> 32:14.215
You'll see.

32:35.698 --> 32:38.368
I told you she was a child.

32:38.451 --> 32:40.412
She can save us.

32:43.248 --> 32:44.625
Emily!

32:49.296 --> 32:51.174
Stop it, stop!

32:51.258 --> 32:52.259
Please stop it!

33:09.571 --> 33:11.822
So, where is she?

33:17.329 --> 33:18.581
Oh.

33:23.503 --> 33:24.254
Oh, no.

34:13.562 --> 34:15.815
- Run, come on, run!
- Run, run, run!

34:15.897 --> 34:16.731
Run, run!

35:31.694 --> 35:33.905
The little one hardly
showed any sign of fear.

35:36.325 --> 35:38.453
Do you think she could be
a threat to my kingdom?

35:42.498 --> 35:43.751
Who said I was worried?

36:19.835 --> 36:20.793
Emergency!

36:24.798 --> 36:26.718
Thank the lord of flowers!

37:08.058 --> 37:10.435
Were you the one
who woke up the monsters?

37:11.518 --> 37:13.980
Actually, there was only one.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.483
And it was furious!

37:15.566 --> 37:16.734
Were you terrified?

37:18.151 --> 37:19.446
I was.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.573
Then it was
you who woke them up!

37:22.448 --> 37:24.366
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.578
It's too late for that!

37:33.544 --> 37:34.337
I'm sorry!

37:36.923 --> 37:39.510
The field, it's expanding!

37:39.594 --> 37:41.471
Action must be taken!

37:41.554 --> 37:43.014
Forward!

37:43.098 --> 37:44.642
Come on, let's go!

37:46.559 --> 37:47.310
Here!

38:05.748 --> 38:07.876
Even better than expected.

38:17.346 --> 38:18.639
Huh?

38:35.909 --> 38:36.910
Psst!

38:36.994 --> 38:37.746
Emily!

39:43.363 --> 39:44.115
Psst!

39:45.990 --> 39:47.200
Psst!

39:47.283 --> 39:48.035
Emily!

39:49.121 --> 39:50.831
What're you doing?

39:50.913 --> 39:52.206
Well, we're saving you!

39:52.290 --> 39:53.041
From what?

39:55.628 --> 39:56.629
Isn't that obvious?

39:57.671 --> 39:58.880
I have to help them.

39:58.965 --> 40:00.173
It's all my fault.

40:01.218 --> 40:03.219
I awoke the monsters.

40:12.938 --> 40:14.566
I'm sorry.

40:14.649 --> 40:15.401
For what?

40:25.078 --> 40:26.414
Let me go!

40:26.497 --> 40:27.749
Sorry!

40:27.832 --> 40:29.040
What're you doing?

40:29.124 --> 40:30.083
Thank you!

40:36.507 --> 40:38.177
What're you doing?

40:38.260 --> 40:41.305
I have to go back,
it's all my fault!

40:44.018 --> 40:45.561
It's not your fault!

40:45.643 --> 40:48.647
The Dying Field has been
growing for years now.

40:48.730 --> 40:50.691
It's the humans' fear
that makes it grow.

40:52.986 --> 40:54.362
What do you mean?

41:02.206 --> 41:02.831
Come on.

41:06.043 --> 41:09.047
It started many years
ago, after the earthquake.

41:09.129 --> 41:12.549
The castle was ruined and the
Dying Fields started to grow.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.937
So there used to
be a real castle?

41:22.020 --> 41:23.355
Oh, yes!

41:23.437 --> 41:24.731
So beautiful.

41:27.567 --> 41:28.318
Beautiful.

41:37.871 --> 41:40.833
The castle was magnificent.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.881
With towers in different colors.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.883
And all of our friends

41:50.261 --> 41:53.890
used to play in the courtyard.

42:03.861 --> 42:07.365
On the top of the main
tower was a crystal

42:09.074 --> 42:11.535
that lit up all of Faunutland.

42:12.955 --> 42:14.415
As far as you could see.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.753
The castle was the
center of Faunutland

42:19.838 --> 42:22.299
and everything was
thriving around it.

42:27.472 --> 42:31.058
And then,
after the earthquake,

42:31.143 --> 42:32.936
the crystal fell down.

42:36.273 --> 42:37.192
And disappeared.

42:40.236 --> 42:43.199
Brave Morninglar, the guardian

42:43.281 --> 42:45.158
of the castle and
of the crystal.

42:50.247 --> 42:51.666
She was looking all over.

42:54.962 --> 42:57.672
And then she was
the first to vanish.

43:09.854 --> 43:12.232
After that, the darkness
started to spread.

43:13.900 --> 43:15.610
Children turned into humans.

43:19.281 --> 43:20.866
And a witch moved
into the castle.

43:26.165 --> 43:29.710
So if we find the crystal,
we could save Faunutland?

43:34.675 --> 43:35.425
Yes.

43:38.263 --> 43:39.681
But we've looked all over.

43:41.306 --> 43:44.227
All of our friends were
searching and searching and then

43:45.521 --> 43:47.814
they started
to turn into this...

43:52.862 --> 43:54.907
But why don't
you ask the humans?

43:54.990 --> 43:57.451
Maybe they can help
you find the crystal.

43:57.534 --> 44:01.038
The humans, they,
they're too afraid.

44:02.498 --> 44:06.502
And besides, they, they
don't believe in magic.

44:06.587 --> 44:09.382
If they'd get a good,
hard look at us,

44:10.467 --> 44:12.510
we would cease to exist.

44:15.388 --> 44:18.057
So the crystal is probably
within the Dying Field.

44:19.351 --> 44:22.230
Humans can't reach it
because they're too afraid,

44:22.313 --> 44:24.065
and magic creatures
have to hide,

44:24.984 --> 44:26.110
and the field is growing.

44:29.655 --> 44:32.241
But you realize
that I'm a child.

44:32.326 --> 44:34.994
Does that mean I
can get it back?

44:38.416 --> 44:39.417
Yes.

44:41.084 --> 44:42.921
But how would I
know where to look?

44:44.297 --> 44:46.633
Well, that's the tricky part.

44:49.387 --> 44:54.100
But as far as we know, as
long as you're not afraid,

44:55.645 --> 44:57.688
you could have searched the
field, little by little,

44:57.772 --> 44:59.440
without waking the monsters up.

45:01.025 --> 45:04.403
It's just that there is
no time to search it all.

45:09.035 --> 45:10.620
Do you have a
map of Faunutland?

45:10.703 --> 45:12.247
Well, of course!

45:12.330 --> 45:13.874
Of course.

45:13.958 --> 45:16.126
There is a book for everything.

45:16.210 --> 45:19.421
A book for king, a book for
bling, a book that makes,

45:19.506 --> 45:23.593
oh, here it is!

45:23.676 --> 45:24.510
Faunutland.

45:25.637 --> 45:26.471
Faunutland.

45:28.683 --> 45:30.184
Got it.

45:30.268 --> 45:31.270
Oh, here it is!

45:33.564 --> 45:35.691
Can you show me where
the Dying Field is?

45:36.691 --> 45:37.734
Well, of course!

45:50.040 --> 45:50.792
Oh.

46:04.223 --> 46:07.811
Yes.

46:07.896 --> 46:10.315
You said that Faunutland
was thriving in a circle

46:10.398 --> 46:11.983
around the castle
and the crystal.

46:13.359 --> 46:14.111
Yes?

46:15.778 --> 46:16.988
What's that?

46:17.865 --> 46:19.201
That's the Well of Echoes.

46:23.038 --> 46:26.334
That's where it
is, the crystal.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.210
No.

46:28.376 --> 46:29.128
No, no.

46:30.588 --> 46:34.509
We've looked all over
and it's not there.

46:34.592 --> 46:36.302
It's not, it's a well.

46:37.722 --> 46:38.890
No place for a crystal.

46:40.224 --> 46:43.228
Very far to bounce,
very far to bounce, no.

46:45.105 --> 46:47.107
No, I don't think
so, not possible.

46:47.190 --> 46:47.942
Nope!

46:49.026 --> 46:50.278
You wanna see something cool?

46:51.445 --> 46:52.404
Ow!

47:07.631 --> 47:08.340
Did you see?

47:09.551 --> 47:12.095
She moved the, did you see that?

48:10.996 --> 48:11.748
All right.

48:13.292 --> 48:17.671
Now remember, the monsters only
awaken when they sense fear.

48:18.882 --> 48:21.259
But even if awoken,
they won't do anything.

48:22.511 --> 48:26.349
They'll only stare at you,
until fear takes control of you.

48:28.850 --> 48:30.895
And if that happens, then...

48:35.984 --> 48:39.363
The Well of Echoes
is beyond that hill.

48:45.495 --> 48:46.913
Good luck.

48:46.997 --> 48:48.624
Thank you.

49:11.484 --> 49:12.611
See you soon.

49:12.695 --> 49:13.737
Hm, good luck.

49:14.904 --> 49:16.531
Oh.

49:16.614 --> 49:18.701
You can talk?

49:18.785 --> 49:20.453
I've always talked.

49:58.039 --> 49:59.707
Oh, this is wonderful.

50:01.542 --> 50:03.961
I just love the smell of fear.

50:04.046 --> 50:07.217
It makes everything so
nice and smooth and...

50:09.719 --> 50:10.470
Huh?

50:42.340 --> 50:43.424
Hey,
what did you do that for?

50:57.441 --> 50:59.234
What are you looking at?

51:13.210 --> 51:14.920
Hiding in the forest, are we?

51:39.781 --> 51:42.577
If the girl gets help,
then so should we.

52:39.686 --> 52:40.769
Focus, Emily!

52:40.853 --> 52:42.647
Don't look at the monsters!

52:54.870 --> 52:55.662
Let go!

53:06.675 --> 53:08.427
She may not make it.

53:10.345 --> 53:11.597
You're right.

53:12.558 --> 53:13.434
Run, Emily!

53:15.853 --> 53:17.605
You can make it if you run!

53:17.688 --> 53:18.565
Emily!

53:18.648 --> 53:19.524
Run!

53:19.608 --> 53:21.026
- Run!
- Run, Emily!

54:46.457 --> 54:47.209
Look.

54:55.135 --> 54:57.554
I think she made it.

54:57.638 --> 55:00.098
Yeah.

56:38.423 --> 56:40.508
Get a grip, Emily.

56:40.592 --> 56:42.428
It's only the darkness.

56:46.140 --> 56:48.100
Nothing to be afraid of.

59:01.047 --> 59:03.257
Go back.

59:05.801 --> 59:07.095
Go back, go back.

59:09.474 --> 59:10.390
Go.

59:10.474 --> 59:11.099
Hello?

59:17.440 --> 59:21.070
You won't make it.

59:21.153 --> 59:22.488
You won't make it.

59:29.663 --> 59:34.628
She doesn't know.

59:40.176 --> 59:41.344
Your mother will not love you,

59:41.426 --> 59:44.264
as much as she
loved your father.

59:44.348 --> 59:46.349
She doesn't love you.

59:46.433 --> 59:48.602
She doesn't love you.

59:48.687 --> 59:49.437
You.

59:51.439 --> 59:52.357
You mother will never love you,

59:52.439 --> 59:55.194
as much as she
loved your father.

59:55.277 --> 59:56.404
It's your fault.

59:57.321 --> 59:59.447
It's all your fault.

59:59.531 --> 01:00:02.159
It's your fault,
it's your fault.

01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:07.125
Your mother will never
love you, as much as...

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:07.959
Dead.

01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:16.509
It's your fault that
your father is dead.

01:00:19.306 --> 01:00:22.434
It's your fault that
your father is dead.

01:00:22.517 --> 01:00:25.061
She wishes you were
dead, instead of him.

01:00:25.146 --> 01:00:27.898
Your mother will never
love you, as much as...

01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:29.566
Leave
me alone, Emily.

01:00:31.444 --> 01:00:32.486
Mom?

01:00:37.284 --> 01:00:40.203
Mom, are you there?

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:44.042
It's your fault,
she doesn't love you.

01:00:44.126 --> 01:00:46.419
She doesn't love you.

01:00:46.502 --> 01:00:48.464
Stop it!

01:00:48.547 --> 01:00:49.757
Stop it, stop it!

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:55.556
Stop it.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.142
With
love in your heart,

01:00:58.224 --> 01:00:59.977
a smile on your face,

01:01:01.563 --> 01:01:04.524
and the courage to dream,
anything is possible.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.351
I don't feel like
playing right now.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:14.565
I need to be alone
for a bit.

01:05:53.779 --> 01:05:54.864
She made it.

01:05:54.946 --> 01:05:56.489
She has the crystal!

01:05:57.741 --> 01:05:58.993
No.

01:05:59.076 --> 01:06:00.245
No!

01:06:00.329 --> 01:06:01.872
Work!

01:06:01.954 --> 01:06:03.622
Work, you have to work!

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.851
Look.

01:06:19.933 --> 01:06:22.394
She's running for the castle!

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.608
No, wait.

01:06:27.485 --> 01:06:29.821
It's too far and too strong.

01:06:29.905 --> 01:06:32.406
You'll never make
it, you'll die.

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:19.670
Hold on, Belorac!

01:07:19.753 --> 01:07:21.172
We're almost there!

01:07:53.919 --> 01:07:56.964
No, you have to get
up, I can't do it!

01:07:57.047 --> 01:07:59.717
My magical thing, I've lost it!

01:08:00.802 --> 01:08:01.553
Get up!

01:08:03.054 --> 01:08:03.804
Emily.

01:08:08.977 --> 01:08:09.729
Emily.

01:08:10.897 --> 01:08:12.483
The magic is here.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:18.154
It's inside of you.

01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:19.991
It's inside all of us.

01:08:22.577 --> 01:08:24.037
Go, you must hurry.

01:08:29.377 --> 01:08:30.127
Go.

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:56.783
A child is in Faunutland.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.419
What's that you've got there?

01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:06.252
Nothing.

01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:12.261
Really?

01:09:14.011 --> 01:09:16.932
I think it looks a
lot like a crystal.

01:09:21.103 --> 01:09:25.317
I'm here to put it back,
I'm gonna save Faunutland.

01:09:29.112 --> 01:09:31.782
Do you think
that's gonna work?

01:09:33.076 --> 01:09:35.118
You think you're doing
something good, don't you?

01:09:35.202 --> 01:09:38.166
Fooling around with
creatures of no purpose.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.627
But listen.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:45.841
Do you hear that?

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:50.846
Hm?

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.852
It's all so quiet and calm.

01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:57.855
All dark and smooth.

01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:03.862
And soon, all of this
wishy-washing will be dark,

01:10:05.363 --> 01:10:06.531
and oh so beautiful.

01:10:06.615 --> 01:10:08.158
No!

01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.994
This crystal's gonna save
Faunutland, you'll see!

01:10:13.206 --> 01:10:13.956
Hm.

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.880
It looks like it's too late.

01:10:22.216 --> 01:10:23.594
Friend of yours?

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:36.525
Do you really think you
can change anything?

01:10:37.819 --> 01:10:40.862
Such an insignificant
little person.

01:10:45.285 --> 01:10:49.916
The most insignificant thing
can make a great difference.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.917
Well, then.

01:10:53.462 --> 01:10:54.171
Go ahead.

01:10:57.882 --> 01:11:00.971
Be a good girl and
save your Faunutland.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:38.973
You see?

01:11:42.478 --> 01:11:44.438
Nobody needs Faunutland.

01:11:50.403 --> 01:11:51.988
I need Faunutland.

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:21.871
Thank you.

01:14:21.955 --> 01:14:23.081
For saving us.

01:16:51.378 --> 01:16:54.717
Oh, I had
the strangest dream.

01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:04.310
I know you miss Dad.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:08.899
I miss him, too.

01:17:22.414 --> 01:17:24.543
There is nothing
you can't accomplish

01:17:25.795 --> 01:17:29.549
with love in your heart,
a smile on your face,

01:17:29.632 --> 01:17:31.718
and the courage to dream.

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:38.892
That's what your
dad used to say to you

01:17:38.975 --> 01:17:40.603
when you were a baby.

01:18:21.776 --> 01:18:23.237
I wanna show you something.

01:18:32.329 --> 01:18:33.457
This is Belorac.

01:18:35.668 --> 01:18:37.587
Your father's best friend.

01:18:40.047 --> 01:18:41.340
He might look scary,

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.762
but he has a kind
heart and a brave soul.

01:18:46.804 --> 01:18:51.768
He's great.

01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:55.232
And this...

01:18:57.859 --> 01:18:59.361
Is Nightinglar.

01:19:05.328 --> 01:19:08.955
She can pull butterflies
from her hands.

01:19:48.293 --> 01:19:49.546
Wish me luck.

01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:54.135
Emily,
are you coming?

01:19:54.217 --> 01:19:54.968
Coming!

01:20:05.106 --> 01:20:09.861
Hey!

01:20:09.943 --> 01:20:10.902
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:15.242
Are you nervous?

01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:16.784
It's gonna be fine.

01:20:59.878 --> 01:21:01.545
That was amazing.

01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:03.715
I've never seen her do that.

01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:14.895
- It was great, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:14.977 --> 01:21:17.649
- Fantastic.
- I'm really impressed.

01:21:18.816 --> 01:21:20.776
- Hey, great game, Emily.
- Hi.

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.861
Thanks.

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:23.405
Hey!

01:21:23.488 --> 01:21:25.115
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

01:21:27.951 --> 01:21:29.495
It was really nice to meet you.

01:21:31.081 --> 01:21:32.873
Will I see you at the next game?

01:21:32.957 --> 01:21:34.416
Yeah, I'll definitely be here.

01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:41.593
By the way, we really
enjoy your books.

01:21:43.136 --> 01:21:44.012
Wait!

01:21:44.096 --> 01:21:45.597
Are you writing anything new?

01:21:48.183 --> 01:21:52.521
Yeah, working on something
with Nightinglar and Belorac.

01:21:52.605 --> 01:21:53.314
Great.

01:21:54.942 --> 01:21:59.864
- See you, bye.
- See you.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.128
You wanna kiss him?

01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:16.174
I'm gonna kiss you!

01:22:33.917 --> 01:22:38.917
