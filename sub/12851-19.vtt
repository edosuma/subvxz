Welcome to...

02:38.626 --> 02:40.425
-The living room.
-Yeah!

02:40.427 --> 02:43.929
-This is so exciting!
-Rowan: Follow us up this way.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.932
And we go
into our audience.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.333
This is where
you guys get to sit

02:48.335 --> 02:50.135
and watch the show.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.470
And guess what, guys?

02:51.472 --> 02:54.473
You can pick any seat
you want! Any seat.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.341
Girl: We definitely want
the front seat.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.377
-Front seat?
-Front and center.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.046
-Rowan: Take 'em, take 'em.
-These are your seats.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.447
Yours, yours,

03:02.449 --> 03:03.649
they're reserved for you, okay?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.551
-Girl: Thank you so much!
-Of course.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.253
So, now that
these are your seats,

03:07.254 --> 03:08.954
you can basically
just kind of do whatever
you want, like leave.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.389
Yeah, 'cause our show
doesn't start till 4:30.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.224
Sabrina:
We don't start for hours,

03:12.226 --> 03:14.293
-so if you guys
want to, like...
-Leave and come back...

03:14.295 --> 03:16.028
-Girl 1: No.
-Girl 2: We're not
going anywhere.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.396
We're not going anywhere.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.499
-Oh. Well, very spunky.
-Oh.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.134
-Sabrina: Okay, um--
-Rowan: In that case...

03:22.136 --> 03:24.703
Both:
You guys are gonna
need some food!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.872
Let's go get you food!
I hope you're hungry!

03:29.009 --> 03:30.542
It's exciting!

03:32.980 --> 03:35.514
Oh, hey, do you remember
that set Topanga's?

03:35.516 --> 03:36.748
-This is it.
-Here it is.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.551
Hey, Mike.
Mike gives us props.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.420
Mike rocks.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.755
-Sabrina: Good morning, guys!
-Rowan: Hi!

03:43.757 --> 03:45.591
It's the cast
and the writers!

03:45.593 --> 03:48.093
Yay! This is at craft service,

03:48.095 --> 03:49.494
where we eat food
every single day.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.130
So, they're eating breakfast.
Yeah, definitely are.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.566
-Micheal?
-Yeah?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.734
Why are we doing this episode?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.536
-Yeah, it's weird.
-No, it's really not.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.005
I want the audience to be
included in one of our episodes,

04:00.007 --> 04:02.274
-and this is the one.
-That's crazy.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.343
You just didn't want to write
a regular episode, right?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.677
-That's what I'm trying to say.
-Yup.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.179
Voice:
Hello?

04:07.181 --> 04:08.413
Shouldn't you guys
be in school?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.215
-Gotta go!
-Run!

04:10.217 --> 04:11.450
-(screaming)
-Run, kids!

04:13.387 --> 04:15.921
Hi! Welcome to
our school room.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.090
The delinquents have arrived.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.524
(laughter)

04:22.863 --> 04:24.296
This is our classroom.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.298
This is where I sit.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.634
-This is where Corey sits.
-Yes, I sit here.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.370
-Amir will mostly
work here though.
-Yeah.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.638
This is our room.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.539
There's-- there's
different rooms that we...

04:34.541 --> 04:38.076
We split up the two rooms
because of the fact that--

04:38.078 --> 04:39.444
Peyton:
We can't concentrate.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.313
We love each other
and we talk too much.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.715
-Too much.
-So this is where Sabrina sits,
that's where Peyton sits.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.450
I get the corner desk.
It used to be Peyton's.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.320
Wesley, our teacher,
is, um, very interesting.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.123
He's kind of a hoarder,
so he just collects everything

04:51.125 --> 04:52.491
and hangs it up
on the walls,

04:52.493 --> 04:54.192
so there's a lot of memories
in this school room.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.599
This is the huge Rowan face.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.334
That's from season one.
We put those up.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.103
And then we have
this whole fan wall

05:05.105 --> 05:07.339
of letters from fans
that we've gotten.

05:07.341 --> 05:11.743
<i>♪ Then I give it all to you ♪</i>

05:11.745 --> 05:14.079
Sabrina:
A lot of times the stuff
that we'll hang up on the walls

05:14.081 --> 05:17.182
are like, drawings that we get
from fans all over the world.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.517
It's really special.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.591
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

05:29.129 --> 05:30.429
This is a really
interesting wall.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.031
We have a bunch
of pictures up here

05:32.032 --> 05:33.632
from when Wesley was
a teacher on<i> Boy Meets World.</i>

05:33.634 --> 05:36.802
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

05:36.804 --> 05:39.538
<i>♪ Fly away with you ♪</i>

05:42.609 --> 05:46.111
In season one,
none of us, like,
we were all too...

05:46.113 --> 05:47.612
None of us wanted
to be in school.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.681
We just all wanted
to be on set with each other

05:49.683 --> 05:51.950
and I think
Wesley told us that

05:51.952 --> 05:53.885
as we kept going on
in the seasons

05:53.887 --> 05:56.455
that we would want to
come to school more

05:56.457 --> 05:58.890
because we were
gonna wanna learn

05:58.892 --> 06:00.459
and this would be
our sacred place

06:00.461 --> 06:02.361
and our like
break room,
if you will.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.497
So now we love being here
and-- and learning.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.733
We like spending time
with each other.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.634
-I don't feel like
doing this, Corey.
-(laughter)

06:15.409 --> 06:17.743
Topanga's take one,
only 'A' Camera 1.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.746
And... action!

06:22.383 --> 06:24.149
Oh, hi!

06:24.151 --> 06:26.385
Because this is
"World Meets Girl,"

06:26.387 --> 06:28.653
we went all over the world,
just not in America,

06:28.655 --> 06:30.922
because we wanted you guys
to be part of this.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.658
Why am I telling you this?

06:33.660 --> 06:35.894
Because I don't think
I was in the show enough.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.363
Both:
We're from Singapore!

06:38.365 --> 06:40.265
Hi, I'm Lauren,
and I'm 12 years old.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.734
Hey, I'm Allison. I'm 16,
and we're from California.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.336
I love<i> Girl Meets World.</i>

06:44.338 --> 06:45.670
It's one of my favorite shows.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.245
-This is wardrobe...
-Where the girls will be...

06:53.247 --> 06:55.414
-For four hours.
-We're ready right now.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.782
Well, it's not really
a competition.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.083
Yes, it is.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.590
No.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.625
No.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.460
-No.
-No.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.096
-No.
-No.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.266
This is hair and makeup,
where all the magic happens.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.700
Yeah, we were done
in like two seconds.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.036
Yeah, some people
take a little longer.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.704
I mean, well,
they have more hair.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.306
Yeah, that's it.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.779
This is Laurie,
my queen.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.848
This is Rowan, my queen.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.189
Hey!

07:40.561 --> 07:42.694
Make me beautiful!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.363
Every week.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.067
Okay, prop room, ours.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.136
-Basically our bay window.
-Guys bay window.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.737
-Let's go. Let's roll.
-Let's do it.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.440
Hey, Jeremy!

07:55.442 --> 07:57.242
Peyton:
What's up, Jeremy?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.747
-Mr. Googly.
-Famous teddy bear...

08:02.749 --> 08:04.316
with no face.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.917
(Peyton laughs)
"With no face."

08:05.919 --> 08:07.953
-We got the tot.
-Got the tot. Talking tot.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.521
Amir:
We also come in here

08:09.523 --> 08:11.756
because we get
the props from Topanga's.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.059
Get the sprinkles.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.362
-Amir: Hi, Mike Warga!
-Peyton: What's up, Mike Warga?

08:17.364 --> 08:20.165
Master artist of all
of Maya's beautiful paintings.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.300
All right, well this is
where we sit and talk.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.668
-Yeah.
-We gossip too.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.704
Yes. So, who are
we gonna talk about first?

08:25.706 --> 08:26.972
Wanna talk about Rowan?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.274
-I like Rowan.
-I like Rowan too. She's nice.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.276
-What about Sabrina?
-Sabrina's nice.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.677
-I like Sabrina.
-Mm-hmm.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.312

08:34.314 --> 08:35.547
-Ceci's great.
-Hilarious.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.282
-What about Corey?
-I don't like Corey.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.950
You don't like Corey?
I don't like Corey either.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.785
-Me neither.
-(laughter)

08:40.787 --> 08:43.188
I'm from Washington DC.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.124
I absolutely love
<i>Girl Meets World.</i>

08:46.126 --> 08:49.461
It's the only show
we can both watch together.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.796
My favorite character would
definitely have to be Farkle.

08:52.799 --> 08:53.865
Um!

08:55.702 --> 08:56.801
Yeah?

08:56.803 --> 08:58.703
(yelps)

08:58.705 --> 09:01.306
-He's smart, funny...
-Farkle isn't going anywhere!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.608
<i>...and he loves</i>
<i>his two best friends,</i>
<i>Maya and Riley.</i>

09:03.610 --> 09:05.010
Both:
Are you speed dating us?

09:05.012 --> 09:07.178
-Donnie Barnes.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.481
-Ladies.

-Ladies.
-Both: Farkle.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.617
-Heh.
-Heh!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.854
-Hm...
-No.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.422
-Oh, we look alike.
-Nope.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.724
Both:
Yay!

09:22.930 --> 09:24.095
Aren't you allergic to cats?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.497
I am allergic to cats.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.898
-But--
-(knock on door)

09:26.900 --> 09:29.501
You guys,
we need you on set!

09:31.939 --> 09:33.605
(knocking)

09:33.607 --> 09:36.408
Corey, Peyton, Amir,
I know you're in there!

09:53.460 --> 09:56.461
Stand by, everybody.
Here we go. Stand by.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.096
And... action!

09:58.098 --> 10:00.198
<i>♪ Take on the world ♪</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:04.135
Are you guys ready
to start our party?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.437
(applause)

10:06.940 --> 10:08.974
All right, get
into our positions
for our scream.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.475
Ben!

10:10.477 --> 10:12.877
-Hey, Ben!
-Beeeen!

10:14.081 --> 10:16.915
Are you ready to meet
our executive producer?

10:16.917 --> 10:17.949
(cheering)

10:17.951 --> 10:19.918
Ladies and gentlemen,
the executive producer

10:19.920 --> 10:23.989
and creator of our show,
Mr. Michael Jacobs!

10:29.963 --> 10:30.962
Auggie:
Beeeeen!

10:30.964 --> 10:32.664
-Come on.
-Beeeeen!

10:34.935 --> 10:37.002
Michael:
Thank you very much, everybody.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.304
You've come to
a real special show today

10:39.306 --> 10:41.172
because normally,
it's<i> Girl Meets World,</i>

10:41.174 --> 10:42.907
but this week,
it's "World Meets Girl."

10:42.909 --> 10:45.010
-because we're able--
-(screaming)

10:47.114 --> 10:49.748

10:49.750 --> 10:50.982
Now, I don't know
who that is.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.818
(laughter)

10:53.820 --> 10:55.620
Hi, my name is Gianna,

10:55.622 --> 10:57.522
and this is my sister Sadie.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.759
We love watching
<i>Girl Meets World</i> because

11:00.761 --> 11:03.962
<i>Riley loves</i>
<i>her little brother Auggie</i>

11:03.964 --> 11:05.830
and I love
my little sister Sadie.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.866
You're my real brother!

11:07.868 --> 11:10.268
I can't breathe!

11:10.270 --> 11:11.436
Auggie.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.805
-I have an older
woman coming over.
-Really?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.940
The characters are
just so funny.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.710
This many tells
this many what to do.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.944
What?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.379
I'm okay with it, Mom.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.948
Do you, Auggie Doggie Matthews,

11:23.950 --> 11:26.184
promise for the rest
of our lives

11:26.186 --> 11:28.520
to never make me
feel bad again?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.455
-I do.
-Hold on.

I want to go to Europe.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.804
Get off my back!

11:49.843 --> 11:51.910
Good game, Auggie.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.448
I believe you're insincere.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.150
This one's for you,

11:59.152 --> 12:01.086
and I hope you all
have a great time.

12:01.088 --> 12:05.056
-(applause)
-We're gonna do a show.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.058
-Maybe. Maybe.
-Actually--

12:07.060 --> 12:09.327
-We don't know, actually.
-Actually, we don't know
what this is.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.528
We'll see.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.030
Are you ready
to meet this cast?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.665
(cheering)

12:15.102 --> 12:18.103
This little girl came in
and originally, we thought,

12:18.105 --> 12:23.074
"It might be nice if
Auggie had a little girlfriend."

12:23.076 --> 12:27.245
And so Ava is now
his wife of three years.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.081
Meet Ava Kolker.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.125
Lucas originally
did not come from New York.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.044
He came from Texas.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.962
And we thought it would be
wonderful if we showed

12:43.964 --> 12:45.897
who his best friend
was back home.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.866
So, we added somebody
and we didn't know

12:47.868 --> 12:49.801
if it was gonna be
one time or forever,

12:49.803 --> 12:52.437
and as soon as
he said his first line,

12:52.439 --> 12:53.972
we knew it was forever.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.040
Say hi to
Amir Mitchell-Townes.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.050
The girl Farkle now cares for

13:06.052 --> 13:09.053
also came for what we thought
may be one episode.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.523
Come on out,
Ceci Balagot!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.097
This little boy started
when he was this big

13:19.099 --> 13:21.766
and he had a bowl haircut
and he talked a mile a minute.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.035
Our Farkle,
Corey Fogelmanis.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.744
And this next little boy
started out also about this big,

13:32.746 --> 13:34.679
and now he's about this big.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.881
Say hi to Auggie,
Auggie Maturo.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.653
Are are you, Auggie!?

13:46.860 --> 13:47.926
Oh, whoa!

13:49.029 --> 13:52.163
This guy is absolutely
a magnificent comedian.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.500
He plays deadpan as well
as anybody I know.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.069
Our Lucas Friar,
Peyton Meyer.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.477
I say two words,
you guys scream,

14:06.479 --> 14:08.613
and those two words
are "Sabrina Carpenter."

14:13.153 --> 14:15.153
And I remember when I used to
do this a long time ago

14:15.155 --> 14:18.156
in the original series,
and I used to bring out

14:18.158 --> 14:20.191
a little girl who was
about that size.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.727
Say hi to our Topanga,
Danielle Fishel.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.869
And the little boy
who started this all,

14:30.871 --> 14:32.837
he came into my office,
he sat on my desk,

14:32.839 --> 14:36.074
he told me exactly how
he would do the show.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.644
I don't think he knew he'd
do it for the next 25 years.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.547
Our Cory Matthews,
Ben Savage.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.822
And we looked
all over the country

14:50.824 --> 14:55.260
and the great news is
there was only one we found.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.195
Let's meet the girl
of<i> Girl Meets World,</i>

14:57.197 --> 14:59.264
Rowan Blanchard.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.669
<i>♪ Take on the world ♪</i>

15:04.671 --> 15:06.671
Audience member:
I love you, Ben Savage!

15:06.673 --> 15:08.139
Oh, thank you!

15:09.876 --> 15:11.910
-I love you!
-Man: I love you more!

15:11.912 --> 15:13.811
Ben:
Are you fighting over me?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.183
Robert:
So, we're gonna
kick off this party--

15:19.185 --> 15:21.052
You know, normally,
you guys get to ask

15:21.054 --> 15:22.253
questions of the cast,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.788
but we're gonna do it
totally differently.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.624
How about if the cast
asks the audience questions?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.192
-How about that?
-(cheering)

15:30.030 --> 15:33.264
Does anyone want to be asked
a question by Peyton Meyer?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.100
(cheering)

15:35.101 --> 15:36.935
Host:
Peyton, you're
creating a frenzy.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
Aah!

15:42.442 --> 15:44.208
-Hi.
-I'm Lucas.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.643
I love it.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.445
My favorite
boy character is Lucas.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.546
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.580
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.615
-Lucas!
-Hand.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.649
-Lucas!
-Grown up voice.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.884
Lucas, hello.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.319
(sniffing)

15:54.321 --> 15:55.954
Girl:
<i>My favorite boy character</i>
<i>is also Lucas</i>

15:55.956 --> 15:58.323
'cause I need
a cowboy in my life.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.925
-Ma'am.
-Ho-ho-ho-ho.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.062
<i>My moment will be...</i>

16:04.064 --> 16:06.331
my moment.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.267
-I kissed Lucas.
-Ya don't say.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.235
My favorite moment is when...

16:11.237 --> 16:13.972
the Lucas, Riley,
and Maya drama.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.773
I've got two tickets
to a concert,

16:15.775 --> 16:19.110
<i>but there's three of us,</i>
<i>so who do I take?</i>

16:19.112 --> 16:23.414
You see, that right there
is a very original situation.

16:23.416 --> 16:27.085
<i>There will be many</i>
<i>twists and turns that</i>
<i>no one will see coming.</i>

16:27.087 --> 16:28.637
Maya:
<i>Look, if I had</i>
<i>feelings for you,</i>

16:28.638 --> 16:30.188
<i>don't you think I'd just</i>
<i>come right out and say it?</i>

16:30.190 --> 16:32.223
Well, I don't,
so what I do say
is huh-hurr--

16:33.493 --> 16:34.993
I did not see that coming.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.995
Lucas:
<i>I have different feelings</i>
<i>for each of you</i>

16:36.997 --> 16:38.930
<i>and I don't entirely</i>
<i>understand them.</i>

16:38.932 --> 16:41.099
I don't want anything bad
to happen to us.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.434
But I especially
don't want to be responsible

16:43.436 --> 16:45.336
for something bad happening
between the two of you.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.270
This spot taken?

16:46.272 --> 16:47.872
-I was saving it.
-For who?

16:49.109 --> 16:50.675
I don't know anymore.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.210
-Riley still loves Lucas.
-(fireworks whistling)

16:52.212 --> 16:54.312
Maya:
<i>This triangle needs to</i>
<i>be put out of its misery,</i>

16:54.314 --> 16:55.346
<i>and there's only</i>
<i>one way to do it.</i>

16:55.348 --> 16:56.681
I need you to
turn me into Riley.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.383
You want to be
Riley Matthews,

16:58.385 --> 17:00.218
you gotta get
inside her soul.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.386
Hi.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.488
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.722
No!

17:04.724 --> 17:06.491
It's always been Riley.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.427
It's always been Riley
since day one.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.997
-So, you're decided.
-Yeah.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.232
Well, there's only
one of us that makes

17:14.234 --> 17:16.334
your little cowboy heart
go clippity-clop.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.935
<i>Go find Riley.</i>

17:18.972 --> 17:20.371
<i>Tell her you love her.</i>

17:20.373 --> 17:22.140
I promise to you

17:22.142 --> 17:24.308
that my moment
would be my moment.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.743
So, this is our moment?

17:25.745 --> 17:26.811
Mm-hmm.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.646
Maya!

17:29.649 --> 17:31.549
It's a jellybean.
I choose you.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.819
And I really want
you to choose me.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.722
I do.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.326
Yeah, uh... I feel
a little far away.

-Wow.
-I'm sorry.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.599
No, I'm just kidding.
Why would it be Riley?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.301
I just think
she's really optimistic

19:37.510 --> 19:38.943
Look at the bird!

19:38.945 --> 19:40.178
Bird.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.946
How am I a triangle with that?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.348
This life thing,
I think I got it down.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.683
Why?!

19:47.453 --> 19:49.020
-Hi!
-Hi!

19:49.022 --> 19:50.121
Come with me!

19:52.492 --> 19:54.492
Awesome!

19:54.494 --> 19:55.826
What is your name?

19:55.828 --> 19:57.528
-Lupe.
-Nice to meet you.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.829
What brings you here?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.565
I wanted to meet
all of you guys

20:00.567 --> 20:03.234
'cause I love your show
and I've been watching it
since it first came out.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.302
Aww.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.306
What is your favorite episode?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.574
"Home for the Holidays."

20:09.576 --> 20:10.741
Aww.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.543
Why is that
your favorite episode?

20:12.545 --> 20:16.380
'Cause it's all of you guys
and from<i> Boy Meets World.</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:17.515
Aww.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.150
And I like...

20:19.152 --> 20:20.251
Aww!

20:20.253 --> 20:21.552
(applause)

20:23.489 --> 20:24.555
Aww.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.090
It's okay.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.229
-So...
-Me!

20:31.231 --> 20:32.430
Oh-- (laughs)

20:34.267 --> 20:36.567
Oh... okay.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.436
-Hi!
-Hi.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.104
-What's your name?
-I'm Ryan.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.839
-You take the mic.
I've got one. You take it.
-Okay.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.774
I feel like a star. Hello.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.176
Oh, hi!

20:45.178 --> 20:46.410
It's so nice to meet you.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.512
Nice to meet you too.
You have nice eyes, by the way.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.547
Aww, you have nice eyes.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.349
-Your hair too. I like this.
-Thank you.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.920
Is there anything
you want to ask me?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.089
-Uh...
-It's hard on the spot,
I get it.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.957
-Yeah, um...
-There's lots of
people watching.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.459
Amir's looking right at you.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.861
I-- I don't know. Um...

21:03.863 --> 21:05.429
what was your feelings
about "Ski Lodge"?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.298
-What were my feelings
about "Ski Lodge"?
-Yes.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.866
Because I had
a lot of feelings.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.334
(laughter)

21:11.471 --> 21:13.604
To revisit the set
that<i> Boy Meets World,</i>

21:13.606 --> 21:16.040
you know, originally created
and to have all these

21:16.042 --> 21:18.209
new characters and all
these new feelings involved.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.245
And I think it showed
what our show is all about,

21:21.247 --> 21:22.280
which is friendship.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.581
Riley and Maya!

21:23.583 --> 21:24.448
(cheering)

21:26.286 --> 21:27.785
Ring power.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.453
-Wait, is that the real ring?
-Yeah, it's the real ring.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.289
-Oh! It's pretty.
-Thanks.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.724
-It's nice.
-There's no diamonds
on it or anything.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.259
I mean, friendship
is a-- is more--

21:35.261 --> 21:36.661
Friendship is a diamond.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.962
-Exactly.
-Aww.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.966
You're wonderful.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.668
You're so fun.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.568
Nice to meet you.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.507
I love<i> Girl Meets World!</i>

21:49.509 --> 21:51.442
My favorite character is Maya.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.943
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.679
I love when
she plays her guitar.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.013
Oh, no.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.628
-She loves art...
-I had no idea.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.630
-<i> and music...</i>
-That was great!

22:12.632 --> 22:14.432
<i>and hanging out</i>
<i>with her bestie,</i>

22:14.434 --> 22:16.600

22:16.602 --> 22:17.601
-Hey!
-Hey!

22:17.603 --> 22:18.869
Hey back.

-Oh!
-Hi, Peaches! You're back!

22:30.950 --> 22:32.550
What'd you bring me?

22:32.552 --> 22:33.718
Nothing. Where's my dinner?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.619
I think I am
more like Maya

22:35.621 --> 22:38.689
<i>because she is fierce.</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:40.391
Yes!

22:40.393 --> 22:44.562
Huh-hurrrrr!

22:45.965 --> 22:48.799
What is your name
with the little ears?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.002
Come here.
Will you come talk to me?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.671
I promise I won't bite.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.706
I'm so excited you're here!

22:55.708 --> 22:57.675
Hi!

22:57.677 --> 22:58.709
What's your name?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.711
-Eliana.
-Eliana.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.882
Who is your favorite character
on<i> Girl Meets World?</i>

23:05.985 --> 23:07.551
You've got a lot
to choose from.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.920
You have Maya, Riley,

23:09.922 --> 23:12.022
Lucas, Farkle,

23:12.024 --> 23:14.358
Smackle, Topanga...

23:14.360 --> 23:15.593
(laughter)

23:17.196 --> 23:19.897
So who would you say
is your favorite? Topanga.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.267
-Riley.
-Riley.

23:23.269 --> 23:26.670
That's great.
That's a very good answer.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.506
Thank you so much, Eliana.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.376
All:
We love<i> Girl Meets World!</i>

23:32.378 --> 23:34.245
I think I relate
most to Topanga

23:34.247 --> 23:36.414
because she's smart,
but she loves to have fun.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.282
Okay, where's this going?

23:38.284 --> 23:40.451
Whatever this is,
do not put me in the middle

23:40.453 --> 23:41.919
of the two people
that I love equally.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.187
Just kidding.
Come here, honey.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.356
(rolling tongue)

23:45.358 --> 23:46.757
I don't want to
see you right now.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.926
You heard your monster.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.762
Will you marry me again?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.064
Mm, mm.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.132
Blue raspberry!

23:55.134 --> 23:56.734
Cory:
<i>I wouldn't change one moment</i>

23:56.736 --> 23:58.636
<i>of anything we ever did.</i>

23:58.638 --> 24:01.272
Are you out...

24:01.274 --> 24:03.207
of your minds?!

24:03.209 --> 24:05.142
That's pretty good, huh?

24:05.144 --> 24:06.277
Yeah.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.645
That's real good.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.181
All:
Oh!

24:10.182 --> 24:11.548
All right, do we have
anymore questions?

24:11.551 --> 24:12.683
(cheering)

24:13.986 --> 24:16.754
I have to pick someone because
she's not raising her hand

24:16.756 --> 24:18.489
and I'm really
interested to know why.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.258
So, come here.
Come over here.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.060
-What's your name?
-My name is Alexis.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.062
What-- Now, why--
Everyone raised their hand.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.330
You didn't have
a question for us?

24:26.332 --> 24:27.498
No.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.833
-Oh.
-(laughter)

24:29.769 --> 24:31.101
Do you have
a favorite character
on the show?

24:31.103 --> 24:32.403
Mm...

24:33.339 --> 24:34.705
Maya.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.641
She's very good.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.143
Alexis, everybody.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.211
(applause)

24:41.981 --> 24:43.414
-It's your turn.
-Mm. Okay.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.482
-Yeah. Stand up.
-Awesome.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.484
Well, I've got
a question in mind.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.818
Does anyone want
to volunteer?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.086
(cheering)

24:49.088 --> 24:50.788
Awesome. Okay, cool.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.056
Hi.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.492
-What's your name?
-Wendy.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.926
I'm Corey. Nice to meet you.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.128
I wanted to ask you
if there have been any moments

24:58.130 --> 24:59.697
or any scenes that
we've done on the show

24:59.699 --> 25:02.199
that have meant a lot to you
and impacted your life.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.202
I like when Riley and Maya
are at the bay window

25:05.204 --> 25:07.338
and they have
their moments together.
It's really sweet.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.606
That's very sweet. Thank you.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.610
(applause)

25:12.612 --> 25:14.011
Yeah, that was
really sweet. My turn.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.212
Oh.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.680
Hey, guys!

25:16.682 --> 25:18.382
-(applause)
-All right!

25:18.384 --> 25:19.717
I'mma ask a question.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.820
Anybody wanna
be asked a question?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.321
(cheering)

25:24.323 --> 25:25.389
Oh, so many people.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.824
Hey, come here.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.893
Hi. You're so cute.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.127
I love the sparkles
on your shirt.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.729
Sit down with me right here.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.030
Perfect.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.965
-I'm Ceci. What's your name?
-Isabella.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.634
Nice to meet you, Isabella.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.536
Has there been
any part of the show
that's changed your life?

25:39.505 --> 25:41.705
I liked when
it was "Meets Jexica"

25:41.707 --> 25:43.707
because it taught me like,
I shouldn't hide myself

25:43.709 --> 25:46.143
and make up a character,
I should show myself
to the world.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.912
-Audience: Aww!
-I love that!

25:47.914 --> 25:49.613
Ooh!

25:50.850 --> 25:52.816
She knows what's up.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.819
Can I have a hug? Aww.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.857
Bye!

25:59.859 --> 26:01.926
I'm Jordan,
I'm 12 years old
from Illinois,

26:01.928 --> 26:03.761
and I love the show
<i>Girl Mets World.</i>

26:03.763 --> 26:05.162
I love how realistic
the characters are

26:05.164 --> 26:06.864
to actual teenagers
like me today.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.599
In "Girl Meets Rileytown,"

26:08.600 --> 26:10.333
<i>Riley was made fun of</i>
<i>because she was different.</i>

26:10.336 --> 26:12.536
Farkle:
<i>A bully makes you feel</i>
<i>like a nothing.</i>

26:12.538 --> 26:14.038
A bully took something
I liked about myself

26:14.040 --> 26:15.272
and made me feel bad about it.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.607
Around that same time,

26:16.609 --> 26:18.108
some kids at my school
were making fun of me.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.510
What do I do, Maya?

26:19.512 --> 26:21.078
We'll all be right behind you.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.881
<i>When I saw Riley reach out</i>
<i>and do what she needed to do,</i>

26:23.883 --> 26:25.282
<i>I felt like I could too.</i>

26:25.284 --> 26:28.052
I've talked to my parents,
my teacher, my friend,

26:28.054 --> 26:29.787
and pretty soon,
it got better.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.923
I guess you could say
I took on the world!

26:32.925 --> 26:33.857
<i>♪ Take on the world ♪</i>

26:37.697 --> 26:39.363
All right, do we have
anymore questions?

26:39.365 --> 26:41.498
-(cheering)
-This is why I'm terrible.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.970
Okay, I'm gonna
choose you, okay?

26:45.972 --> 26:47.304
You're all wonderful.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.540
Hi, hi, what's your name?

26:49.542 --> 26:50.941
-Emma.
-Hi, Emma. Come sit down.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.577
Hold this.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.279
Where are you from, Emma?

26:55.281 --> 26:57.781
-Georgia.
-You're a Georgia peach.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.116
That's nice.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.784
Do you have
a favorite character
on the show?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.586
-Yes.
-And it's me.

27:02.588 --> 27:03.954
Yeah.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.025
Piddily-poppily-pah-poo!

27:08.995 --> 27:10.060
What the--

27:10.062 --> 27:11.895
-Shovel.
-Mm.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.302
-No.
-(laughter)

27:20.640 --> 27:21.905
but it should be me.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.942
-Who's your favorite
character on the show?
-Maya.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.944
She's awesome.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.963
She is awesome.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.981
But I want you to think
about maybe making me
your favorite character.

27:30.983 --> 27:31.915
I'm mad with power.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.656
I would never wear that.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.360
No? Okay.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.962
Well, just think about it.
That's all I'm asking.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.830
Okay, well, thank you.
Thanks for being here.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.399
You did great.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.137
Sabrina:
Hi! Hi!

27:53.139 --> 27:55.005
-Rowan: Come sit with us.
-Come sit with us, yeah.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.106
Sit with us!

27:56.108 --> 27:57.474
How are you?

27:57.476 --> 27:58.842
-I feel like I'm intruding.
-Oh, hi.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.010
What are you doing here?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.211
-Should I move or--
-Yes.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.014
-No, I'm kidding,
you can stay.
-All right.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.482
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.051
We hear you're best friends.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.318
-Is that right?
-Both: Yes.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.853
-What are your names?
-I'm Dracy.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.021
And I'm Savannah.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.790
What's your favorite thing
about each other?

28:12.792 --> 28:14.725
Well, I love that
Savannah's caring

28:14.727 --> 28:21.065
and she's kind
and she's always
standing up for me

28:21.067 --> 28:23.133
and my other friend Nyla
and Samiah.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.368
Aww.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.071
She's kind,
she's generous,

28:27.073 --> 28:30.140
and she's my best friend
in the whole wide world

28:30.142 --> 28:32.009
beside my other friends.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.378
-Rowan: Gosh!
-You guys!

28:35.381 --> 28:36.980
Sabrina:
Well, my favorite thing
about Rowan is

28:36.982 --> 28:38.682
how kind and generous she is.

28:38.684 --> 28:41.919
I'd say she's really nice
to Nyla too, and I think that--

28:41.921 --> 28:43.220
(laughter)

28:43.222 --> 28:44.855
-I mean--
-I really feel
like I'm intruding here.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.023
(laughter)

28:46.025 --> 28:48.892
So, since you guys
are best friends,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.227
we wanted to
give you something

28:50.229 --> 28:52.362
that maybe you'll recognize
from the show.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.897
Sabrina:
And hopefully you can

28:53.899 --> 28:56.600
keep these with each other
for the rest of your lives.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.069
Riles, a friendship ring.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.838
-Yeah.
-Two of them.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.740
-Yeah.
-In case I lose one.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.275
-No.
-Oh, I get it.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.944
-Yeah.
-One for each hand.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.011
No.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.048
I'll never take this off
until I die.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.650
You'll probably die before me
since you're older.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.787
And Maya, the other ring...

29:16.789 --> 29:18.021
Is for you.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.423
Yeah.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.924
Oh, no.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.860
If you're not there,
who's going to tell the people

29:22.862 --> 29:25.496
not to take it off
my dead corpse body?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.599
Happy birthday, Maya.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.434
-Lightning!
-Thunder!

29:30.436 --> 29:32.302
-Darkness!
-Bunny rabbits!

29:32.304 --> 29:34.738
-Come here!
-I really don't want to.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.940
You come here right now.
Ring power.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.543
When we say "ring power,"
you have to. It's a rule.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.814
You open this
bay window right now!

29:43.816 --> 29:46.750
I wish to be alone.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.252
Ring power!

29:48.254 --> 29:49.620
Curses!

29:52.124 --> 29:53.323
Thunder.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.959
Lightning.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.795
Both:
Forever.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.563
Both:
Thank you.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.132
-Of course.
-You guys can do
"thunder lightning."

30:02.134 --> 30:04.234
Sabrina:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
ring power, that always works.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.138
I love<i> Girl Meets World.</i>

30:08.140 --> 30:09.973
I think boys like it too

30:09.975 --> 30:12.676
because it's really good
and I like it so much.

30:12.678 --> 30:17.381
I learn life lesson from Lucas.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.520
<i>Lucas is kind and generous</i>

30:23.522 --> 30:25.122
and he's always
protecting everyone.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.324
Aah! Lucas!

30:27.326 --> 30:28.759
I'm coming!

30:31.497 --> 30:32.996
(football player growls)

30:35.467 --> 30:36.967
I love you!

30:36.969 --> 30:39.603
Oh, I love you too, Peyton.

30:39.605 --> 30:40.871
Ah.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.773
Crew member:
Guys, together,
you do one more.

30:42.775 --> 30:44.675
Pick out somebody else, put...

30:44.677 --> 30:46.109
-Together?
-(cheering)

30:49.048 --> 30:50.514
-Peyton: Pick away.
-Amir: Huh?

30:50.516 --> 30:52.516
-You pick. You pick
the person. Yes, you pick.
-I pick?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.918
She screamed my name,
so I have to pick her!

30:55.988 --> 30:58.322
-How are you?
Come take a seat.
-Come sit.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.123
Here, take the mic.
There you go.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.658
-Take the mic.
-How are you?

31:01.660 --> 31:03.360
-I'm good.
-You're good?
What's your name?

31:03.362 --> 31:04.494
My name's Olivia.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.197
Do you have a best bud like...

31:07.199 --> 31:08.198
Riley and Maya

31:08.200 --> 31:09.399
-Or Zay and Lucas?
-Yeah.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.501
-Really? What's her name?
-Her name's Jessie.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.203
Oh, well, shoutout Jessie then.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.906
-Do it right now.
Shoutout to Jessie.
-She screamed. Right there.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.341
-Oh, she's here!
-Amir: Jessie's here!

31:17.343 --> 31:18.909
Amir:
Jessie!

31:21.046 --> 31:22.179
Much love to you!

31:22.181 --> 31:23.714
She kind of has
a crush on Ben.

31:23.716 --> 31:24.882
Jessie, who do you love?

31:24.884 --> 31:27.184
Ben Savage!

31:27.186 --> 31:28.685
You love Ben!

31:28.687 --> 31:30.420
(cheering)

31:38.097 --> 31:40.197
So a lot of people ask us

31:40.199 --> 31:42.032
if we have any bloopers
on the show,

31:42.034 --> 31:44.201
but I don't think we've ever
really made a mistake.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.003
No, we have never
made a mistake.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.070
We're professionals.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.207
But in case we ever
did make a mistake,

31:50.209 --> 31:53.110
here are some of
our favorite bloopers, and...

31:53.112 --> 31:55.445
one of our favorites
includes Mr. Peyton Meyer.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.849
-Hm...
-Good luck!

31:58.851 --> 32:04.121
(bad British accent)
Mount Farkleuvius has awoken
in all its bubbling glory.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.289
What is that?

32:05.291 --> 32:07.524
That's my fancy
British guy, Mortimer.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.226
(laughs)

32:09.228 --> 32:10.360
Sounds like
you're eating meatloaf.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.162
(inhales)
Meatloaf!

32:13.732 --> 32:15.165
Twiggle-Bottom-Smythe.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.235
Twiggle-Smythe.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.636
Twiggle-Bottom-Smythe.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.605
Okay.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.640
I'm not Lucas anymore.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.679
I'm Taylor Tristan Cool
Cool McPoopy Pants.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.215
-Crew member: No.
-What is it?

32:35.287 --> 32:36.787
Do you do accents?

32:38.958 --> 32:42.826
(bad accent)
I am Mortimer
Twiggle-Bottom-Smythe.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.361
Next!

32:47.466 --> 32:48.832
(cheering)

32:51.470 --> 32:53.670
These ones aren't
so much bloopers as...

32:53.672 --> 32:56.573
well, somebody
kept on falling down.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.975
Corey.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.311
It's happening again, sir.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.519
I'm going down, sir.
Oh, he's not even here.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.620
What'd I miss?

33:10.622 --> 33:11.855
(yelling)

33:13.659 --> 33:14.758
What'd I miss?

33:15.828 --> 33:17.160
The same!

33:19.298 --> 33:20.931
I'm comin', honey.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.939
Now these are bloopers.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.776
Ms. Hart...

33:32.778 --> 33:34.277
you have detention.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.613
The principal
wants you to...

33:36.615 --> 33:38.115
Hey!

33:39.351 --> 33:40.784
They're in the yearbook.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.387
Keep in touch
and have an awesome summer.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.197
♪ I kiss your gray face ♪

33:54.199 --> 33:59.202
All:
♪ But it feels like
you're lightyears away ♪

34:01.340 --> 34:02.372
Or not-- Or what?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.540
Stop. Stop!

34:03.542 --> 34:05.375
You messed up!

34:05.377 --> 34:06.843
Dang it!

34:06.845 --> 34:08.445
Crew member:
Fix the pillows!

34:10.315 --> 34:11.415
(screams)

34:12.851 --> 34:15.085
"Hi, Jexica.
My name is Lucas Friar--"

34:15.087 --> 34:17.220
Wait, why would Lucas
write to Jexica?

34:18.991 --> 34:21.358
(chuckles lowly)
Well...

34:21.360 --> 34:24.628
This is what happens
when you put the script
on the computer.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.297
(chortles)

34:29.334 --> 34:30.434
(laughs)

34:32.538 --> 34:33.603
Hey!

34:33.605 --> 34:36.039
Start finding
yourself, Maya. Oh!

34:36.041 --> 34:37.441
What--

34:40.245 --> 34:41.411
(thunk)

34:53.258 --> 34:54.491
<i>♪ Take on the world ♪</i>

34:56.462 --> 34:58.361
In our spare time,
we... we... (laughs)

34:58.363 --> 35:00.597
we often
have really deep,

35:00.599 --> 35:02.466
meaningful conversations
with each other.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.469
-Yes.
-And those
conversations take place...

35:05.471 --> 35:08.271
In the bay window
both on and off camera...

35:08.273 --> 35:10.707
for Riley and Maya
and Sabrina and Rowan.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.776
So, we decided that
we would do a thing

35:12.778 --> 35:14.311
called "Bay Window Confessions."

35:14.313 --> 35:16.279
(cheering)

35:16.281 --> 35:18.882
Where we're gonna help people
figure out their problems.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.750
(laughter)

35:20.752 --> 35:22.419
But it only works
for best friends.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.421
(cheering)

35:24.423 --> 35:27.090
-So, we're gonna
pick out some best friends.
-Best friends.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.059
bring 'em to
the bay window.

35:29.061 --> 35:30.994
(cheering)

35:34.399 --> 35:35.332
You two!

35:35.334 --> 35:36.566
(applause)

35:36.568 --> 35:39.236
-Hi.
-Hi, what's your name?

35:39.238 --> 35:40.904
-Sadie.
-You have such cute freckles.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.573
-Thank you.
-Come on, guys, we're gonna
take you to the bay window.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.475
-Sadie: I love you so much.
-I love you too! How are you?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.712
-I'm good! I love all of you!
-Aww, thank you so much.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.417
Welcome to<i> Girl Meets World.</i>

35:54.419 --> 35:55.986
Crew member:
Stepping into
the bay window now.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.522
-This is the bedroom.
-Oh, my god, oh, my gosh,

35:58.524 --> 36:01.424
I actually never thought
I would step in here!

36:01.426 --> 36:03.593
All right, okay,
so who's more of a Riley

36:03.595 --> 36:05.262
and who's more of a Maya?

36:05.264 --> 36:07.998
-Best Friend: I am
definitely more of a Maya.
-You're definitely more Maya?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.799
Okay, we're going
into the bay window.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.535
Bay window, take two.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.537
Robert:
That bay window brings out

36:13.539 --> 36:15.839
the truth serum
in everybody!

36:15.841 --> 36:17.340
Action!

36:17.342 --> 36:18.975
Hi, guys. Hi.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.277
Welcome to the bay window.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.978
Yes, welcome to
our bay window.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.348
This bay window has
a very special power,

36:25.350 --> 36:27.551
which you see
a lot in our show,

36:27.553 --> 36:30.053
'cause it-- it really gets
the truth out of you.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.521
Yeah, it gets
the truth out of you,

36:31.523 --> 36:33.123
it connects two
best friends, I think.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.525
This is a very special
place to us, Lucas.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.195
This is where
Riley and I figure out
our most important stuff.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.297
I apologized
like 50 times!

36:40.299 --> 36:41.565
You don't do that to me!

36:41.567 --> 36:43.233
Oh, this one's bad.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.568
It's Riley and Maya.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.069
They love each other.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.572
We have something
to talk about, you and me.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.440
Why wouldn't you come to me?

36:53.045 --> 36:55.879
How could you not come to me
if someone is bullying you?

36:58.217 --> 37:00.116
I'm humiliated, Maya.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.387
I didn't want to let you
see me humiliated.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.227
Life is changing,
isn't it?

37:10.229 --> 37:11.361
Yes.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.763
But this never will.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.366
Dream dreams, Maya.

37:16.368 --> 37:19.169
How is it possible that
you can still have hope for me?

37:19.171 --> 37:23.573
Hey, I have hope for something
four billion miles away.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.675
You...

37:25.677 --> 37:27.944
<i>have always been right here.</i>

37:27.946 --> 37:29.479
Have I let you down?

37:30.682 --> 37:33.016
How could you ever
let me down?

37:33.018 --> 37:35.619
Your safe place is us.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.087
Your safe place is me.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.858
And I'm yours.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.362
From the day we met.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.199
-Sup?
-I'm Riley.

37:49.201 --> 37:50.600
I'm Maya Penelope Hart.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.735
Are we friends forever?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.470
Whatever you want.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.239
Riley and Maya
talk about their

37:56.241 --> 37:58.642
deepest, darkets--
darkest secrets here,

37:58.644 --> 38:01.711
so we want to hear
from you guys a little bit.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.714
But it's only better, like,
when you guys are alone,
so we're gonna...

38:04.716 --> 38:06.082
We're gonna go.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.517
-Have fun.
-(applause)

38:10.956 --> 38:12.756
-Should I start?
-Yeah, you should.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.791
Okay. Um...

38:14.793 --> 38:17.494
I'll just talk about
how I felt when I first met you.

38:17.496 --> 38:20.096
When I first met you,

38:20.098 --> 38:21.865
I don't know what it was...

38:23.001 --> 38:24.668
Audience:
Aww.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.670
Can I have a hug?

38:27.572 --> 38:30.674
that there was
something about you.

38:30.676 --> 38:31.841
(applause)

38:35.113 --> 38:36.946
There was something about you
that just made me feel

38:36.948 --> 38:40.083
so different from what
everybody else made me feel.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.353
I feel like I can just be
my own, 100% complete self

38:43.355 --> 38:44.521
around you.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.357
And I can't thank you
enough for that.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.625
And...

38:48.627 --> 38:50.694
I seriously don't know
where I would be

38:50.696 --> 38:52.595
or what I would be doing
without you right now.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.797
And...

38:53.799 --> 38:56.666
I'm so glad
to have you in my life.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.502
-I love you.
-I love you too.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.837

39:02.541 --> 39:03.940
Director:

40:10.742 --> 40:14.277
Well, we've been best friends
since like first grade

40:14.279 --> 40:15.712
and now we're going
into high school.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.747
But back in elementary school,

40:17.749 --> 40:19.849
when we went through
that long period

40:19.851 --> 40:23.586
where we didn't talk
to each other, um...

40:25.690 --> 40:28.291
-It's okay.
-the real re...

40:28.293 --> 40:30.059
The reason I didn't talk to you

40:30.061 --> 40:32.929
was because you-- I was--

40:32.931 --> 40:35.265
I was just, like,
really jealous of you.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.734
I thought you were
a lot smarter than me.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.102
-In first grade?
-No!

40:39.104 --> 40:40.770
No, like, like...

40:42.741 --> 40:45.041
like in fifth grade,
I thought you were
smarter than me

40:45.043 --> 40:46.743
and you were faster than me.

40:46.745 --> 40:50.046
And so I-- I didn't like
to be around you.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.781
But I'm glad we got over that.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.649
Aww!

40:52.651 --> 40:54.551
Rowan:
Aww!

40:56.321 --> 40:59.122
(applause)

41:01.726 --> 41:02.625
That was beautiful.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.335
Uh, John, okay, so...

41:12.337 --> 41:14.237
I've known you
for about two years.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.072
I can be myself
around people

41:16.074 --> 41:18.308
'cause you've really
just helped me out

41:18.310 --> 41:20.477
in so many ways.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.778
That's the same thing
for me. Like,

41:21.780 --> 41:23.680
when we met, like,
I wasn't really comf--

41:23.682 --> 41:25.181
Audience: Aww...

41:25.183 --> 41:28.284
I wasn't really
confident with myself

41:28.286 --> 41:30.119
and being myself
around other people.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.621
And then meeting you,
I don't know,

41:31.623 --> 41:33.857
it just clicked
and I opened up.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.525
-You're my best friend.
-You're mine.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.827
My life is just
changed for the better.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.095
Thank you.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.732
(applause)

41:45.604 --> 41:47.136
That was so cute.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.705
That was amazing.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.842
<i>♪ You were there for me ♪</i>

41:52.844 --> 41:55.812
Well, we've been friends
since seventh grade.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.014
And we were, like,
okay friends,

41:58.016 --> 41:59.883
and I think you
didn't like me.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.651
-Oh...
-I was okay with that.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.253
'Cause I really liked you

42:03.254 --> 42:04.854
'cause you were really pretty,
and smart, and athletic.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.056
You're pretty too!

42:07.058 --> 42:09.192
And then we
started to get closer

42:09.194 --> 42:10.727
because of the show.

42:10.729 --> 42:11.895
<i>-Girl Meets World.</i>
-Yeah.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.396
I was really
thankful for that.

42:13.398 --> 42:15.899
And we actually started our
friendship because of this show.

42:15.901 --> 42:18.034
And I'm really thankful

42:18.036 --> 42:20.537
'cause you make me
the happiest person ever.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.071
'cause you make me
the happiest person ever

42:22.073 --> 42:23.840
with your random texts
that you send me

42:23.842 --> 42:24.974
like, in the middle
of the day

42:24.976 --> 42:26.809
when you know
that I'm so sad.

42:26.811 --> 42:28.211
You're always there for me.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.880
And I thank you so much.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.348
(applause)

42:35.887 --> 42:37.620
Okay, my life is ruined now.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.423
Hi, I'm Emory.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.325
I'm from Colorado,
and I'm ten years old.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.661
I absolutely love
<i>Girl Meets World.</i>

42:44.663 --> 42:47.063
There's no other, you know,
show like this out there.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.832
I really love how they
incorporate<i> Boy Meets World</i>
into<i> Girl Meets World.</i>

42:49.834 --> 42:51.501
Nature!

42:51.503 --> 42:53.269
Nature!

42:53.271 --> 42:54.370
Feeny!

42:54.372 --> 42:55.872
Wha-wha-wha-wha!

42:55.874 --> 42:57.407
Fuh-huh-huh-huh-huh...

42:57.409 --> 42:59.909
What, what, what?!

43:02.514 --> 43:05.214
One of the things
that has meant the most to me

43:05.216 --> 43:06.583
in this experience

43:06.585 --> 43:08.785
has been seeing
the real life friendships

43:08.787 --> 43:10.620
that form
amongst you guys.

43:10.622 --> 43:12.855
And the way you have been
a support to each other.

43:12.857 --> 43:15.258
And no matter what
has gone on,

43:15.260 --> 43:17.393
you guys have always
come back to each other

43:17.395 --> 43:19.095
and made each other
the priority.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.230
And that's been something

43:21.232 --> 43:24.067
that's been really special
for me to watch you guys do.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.769
And I feel really, truly
honored to know all of you

43:26.771 --> 43:28.304
and to call you all friends.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.707
And, um, I really
look forward to seeing

43:30.709 --> 43:32.375
what the future holds
for all of you.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.011
(applause)

43:38.950 --> 43:41.818
Well, I guess it's my turn.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.886
One of the things that
I continue to learn every day

43:43.888 --> 43:45.888
about being associated
with the show

43:45.890 --> 43:47.123
is just the name of the show.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.459
You never stop
meeting the world.

43:49.461 --> 43:52.962
And it doesn't matter
if you're five, or you're 15,

43:52.964 --> 43:55.064
or you're... 35?

43:55.066 --> 43:58.468
Every day is a journey,
it's an experience.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.603
And I think that's one of
the most important things

44:00.605 --> 44:01.971
that I'm gonna
take away from this show.

44:01.973 --> 44:05.975
And I'm privileged to have
worked with all of you guys.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.810
