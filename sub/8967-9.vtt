Luckily, he has some

titillating tidbits
I can pick up.

Okay, Bert,
I'll get a few more photos.

No peanut butter?

01:59.853 --> 02:01.888
How can you have a party
without peanut butter?!

02:01.888 --> 02:04.491
Boy! I never seen a
set up like this before.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.426
I don't care
what you say!

I think she's fine stock, Knox!

you're playing with fire!

Mr Knox: So, when do
you make the proposal?

Tomorrow!

The Pig: No problem boss.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.293
Where is Cedric?
I haven't seen him all morning.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.661
There's work to be done.

The Pig 3: Now look
what you've done!

04:46.653 --> 04:50.189
The Pig 1: Uh oh, we'd
better
deliver these right away.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.198
Cedric, what
do you think you're doing?

04:59.198 --> 05:01.868
Ohh, hi, Pop!
I'm baking a cake.

05:01.868 --> 05:05.171
It's for the Young Aardvark
Society bake sale.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.509
To all
mothers of young aardvarks,

once again we ask
you to contribute

05:12.278 --> 05:14.881
baked goods for our annual sale.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.150
Do you want me to help?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.686
No, Pop.
I'm doing all right.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.322
Maybe I,
I could hire someone

05:22.322 --> 05:23.756
to do this sort of thing.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.792
Nah, I like doing it.

05:25.792 --> 05:29.362
Why don't you go
out and buy a nice cake?

05:29.362 --> 05:31.864
Nah, it just
wouldn't be the same.

05:31.864 --> 05:36.202
Well, do you want me to
come along to the bake sale?

05:36.202 --> 05:38.137
Oh no,
that's all right, Pop.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.406
I know, you don't
like those things.

05:40.406 --> 05:44.377
Ah.. well, buy me
your cake at the bake sale.

05:45.445 --> 05:49.115
Oops! See if you can
get a good deal.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.183
Sure, Pop.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.252
Yes, well,

05:53.252 --> 05:55.488
as soon as you're finished, ehm,

05:55.488 --> 05:58.157
come on upstairs
and cook some books.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.660
Will do, Pop!

06:01.794 --> 06:05.932
I'm only a father.

Oh! You may go! Ta-ta.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.490
The Pig 2: Well, we'd better
get this other one to Mammoth.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.060
Lady B-B: Ugh-uh-uuh.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.965
And I think, it's about
time we tied the knot!

06:38.965 --> 06:40.967
Oh, my-my-my-my-my!

06:40.967 --> 06:42.301
Oh-oooh!

06:43.202 --> 06:44.771
Oh, I don't know, Melissa,

06:44.771 --> 06:47.940
my social column's a bit dull.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.943
I'll bet Sophia would
have done a better job.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.279
I'm sure
it's fine, Bert.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.181
It's all in
how you write it.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.317
You know for a while there
I thought I had some real news.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.122
I thought,
I heard Cyril Sneer

07:04.657 --> 07:07.026
talking about getting married!

07:08.861 --> 07:11.664
Now, that
would be some story!

07:11.664 --> 07:13.332
Lady B-B: Yuuuhuuu!

07:13.966 --> 07:16.335
Good morning!

07:16.335 --> 07:19.338
Oh, isn't it a
simply beautiful day?

07:19.338 --> 07:22.041
Uh, well, um.. yes!

07:22.041 --> 07:24.277
Lady B-B: I would like to
publish a very important

07:24.277 --> 07:28.114
announcement in your
wonderful little newspaper.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.116
Certainly,
Lady Baden-Baden.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.384
What's your announcement?

07:31.384 --> 07:34.887
Lady B-B: I would like the
whole Evergreen forest to know

07:34.887 --> 07:39.392
of the impending marriage
between myself

07:39.392 --> 07:44.330
and Mr. Cyril Sneer!!!

07:47.633 --> 07:48.334
I can't understand why Mammoth

07:48.334 --> 07:50.803
I can't understand why
Mammoth hasn't called yet.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.540
Are you sure you porkers
delivered the proposal to him?

07:54.540 --> 07:56.676
The Pig 1:
Oh, absolutely, Sir.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.744
The Pig 2:
Right to the door, Sir.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.613
The Pig 3: Oh, wait, Sir!

08:00.613 --> 08:02.582
Something's
coming across now.

08:04.917 --> 08:08.187
From Mammoth
to Sneer. Stop.

08:08.187 --> 08:13.025
Don't remember inviting
you to a party. Stop.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.229
You're welcome anyway. Stop.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.463
Party?!

08:17.463 --> 08:19.899
What's that tubby
tycoon talking about?

08:19.899 --> 08:23.870
Pop! Lady Baden-Baden
is here to see you.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.538
Can't you see, I'm busy!

08:25.538 --> 08:28.107
Tell her to come back
sometime when I'm not here!

08:28.107 --> 08:30.476
I don't think
she'll go for that, Pop.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.745
Lady B-B: Uuuuh, Cyril!

08:32.745 --> 08:34.547
Yes, yes, yes!

08:34.547 --> 08:37.049
I do accept! I do! I do!

08:37.049 --> 08:39.185
Uh-ehm.. That's nice.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.686
What is it you accept?

08:40.686 --> 08:44.357
Lady B-B: Uuh, you
silly, wonderful man!

08:44.357 --> 08:47.760
Why, your proposal
of marriage, of course!

08:47.760 --> 08:49.629
But I, but I...
Lady B-B: Oh, we have

08:49.629 --> 08:53.266
so much to plan for
and so little time!

08:53.266 --> 08:55.902
Oh, there's my dress,
and the finger towels.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.937
Oh, and the doilies...
Doilies?!

08:57.937 --> 09:00.907
You mixed up those
letters, didn't you?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.808
The Pig: Oh,
well, well, um...

09:02.808 --> 09:04.076
Gee...

09:04.076 --> 09:05.645
Pop married?

09:05.645 --> 09:08.781
Lady B-B: ..yes, and the
flowers and the limousine
Cedric!! Wait!!

09:08.781 --> 09:12.251
Lady B-B: Oh, and
the bows on the pews!

09:12.251 --> 09:15.788
Cedric!
Lady B-B: And now, you
must show me your house!

09:15.788 --> 09:18.824
Where are the rest
of your domestics?

09:22.995 --> 09:26.966
Wooow! What a story!

09:26.966 --> 09:28.668
I still can't believe it!

09:28.668 --> 09:30.636
I think, it's romantic.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.305
Cedric!!!

09:32.305 --> 09:34.840
Congratulations!
You must be so happy.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.976
This is such a good news
Congratulations!

09:37.610 --> 09:41.213
We kept the first
copy for you, Cedric.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.082
As a souvenir.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.184
Um, thanks, Bert!

09:45.184 --> 09:47.486
Bert, can I talk to you?

09:48.187 --> 09:49.789
Privately?
Huh?

09:49.789 --> 09:52.158
Oh, sure, Cedric, old buddy.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.597
Lady B-B: Oh, Cyril, this place

09:57.597 --> 10:00.499
certainly needs a woman's touch.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.869
I don't know how you've
lived like this for so long.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.838
Hammett!
Lady B-B: Oh!

10:05.838 --> 10:08.874
What a wonderful team
we're going to make, Cyril.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.544
You were so right
about the partnership.

10:11.544 --> 10:15.214
We'll make beautiful
music together. Ta-taa!

10:16.148 --> 10:18.084
Ohh, and Cyril,

10:18.084 --> 10:20.686
if you must keep
pigs in the house,

10:20.686 --> 10:23.289
couldn't you dress
them up a bit?

10:23.289 --> 10:27.393
I have my domestics
wearing neckties.

10:27.393 --> 10:28.628
Oh!!

10:29.495 --> 10:32.331
The kind of necktie
I've got in mind

10:32.331 --> 10:35.835
for you three walking sausages
is made of rope!

10:35.835 --> 10:39.372
Now get that proposal out
to the right Mammoth!

10:39.372 --> 10:41.173
The Pigs: Oh, yes, Sir!

10:42.975 --> 10:45.311
And now I've
got to find Cedric,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.413
and explain this to him.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.886
You mean,
your Pop didn't tell you

10:53.886 --> 10:56.589
he was gonna get married?
No.

10:56.589 --> 11:00.092
Well, um, maybe he forgot.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.994
I don't think so, Bert.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.364
Maybe, he was just
afraid of what I'd say.

11:05.364 --> 11:08.434
Maybe, he thought
I wouldn't like it.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.568
Well, um...

11:09.568 --> 11:11.604
Perhaps
I've been selfish.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.939
Pop's been alone so long.

11:13.939 --> 11:17.476
Maybe he needs someone...
to talk to.

11:17.476 --> 11:21.580
A companion! I never thought
about Pop being lonely.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.315
Cedric!!

11:23.315 --> 11:26.218
Cedric, my boy.
Pop?

11:26.218 --> 11:28.788
I've been looking
all over for you.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.024
You didn't have to
do that. I was right here.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.427
We've got to talk. Alone!

11:36.929 --> 11:39.198
Um, I'll see
you later, Cedric.

11:41.333 --> 11:45.337
Son, about this
Baden-Baden thing.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.139
Congratulations, Pop!

11:47.139 --> 11:49.742
I'm very... happy for you.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.813
You... you are?
Sure, I am!

11:53.813 --> 11:56.482
I think it will be great

and I'll... have a mother.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.021

(giggles) Boy,

13:00.146 --> 13:03.048
looks like Lady Baden-Baden's
been busy already.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.656
My! Aren't we spiffy?

13:10.656 --> 13:12.324
The Pig: Go ahead, laugh.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.894
Lady B-B: Whoo iiiis it?

13:14.894 --> 13:17.463
We've brought some
wedding gifts for you.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.532
Lacy B-B: Just
freshening the place up.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.000
So what do you think?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.003
Well, it's, um,
eh, um, it's very.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.806
um, (giggles).. pink?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.307
What's this!?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.042
Not more doilies?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.645
Congratulations, Mr Sneer.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.547
We've just
come to wish you luck.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.815
I'll need it!

13:36.182 --> 13:37.183
Ugh!

13:44.590 --> 13:46.492
Lady B-B: There!
Isn't that better?

13:46.492 --> 13:49.762
Yes... thanks!

13:49.762 --> 13:51.730
So? Uhm...

13:51.730 --> 13:53.232
When's the wedding?

13:53.232 --> 13:54.834
Mr Knox: Never!!

13:54.834 --> 13:57.903
As far as I'm concerned.

13:57.903 --> 14:02.041
Lady B-B: Oh! My dear, Mr Knox,

14:02.041 --> 14:03.709
whatever do you mean?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.911
Mr. Knox: Oh Lady Baden-Baden,

14:05.911 --> 14:09.315
I've concealed my true
feelings long enough.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.350
I love you.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.753
And I want you to be my bride.

14:14.753 --> 14:18.023
You do? That's great!
Huh?

14:18.023 --> 14:21.627
I mean it's great that
you want to, but... heh...

14:21.627 --> 14:24.263
she's marrying me, Knox!

14:24.263 --> 14:27.466
Mr. Knox:
In that case, Mr. Sneer,

14:27.466 --> 14:30.769
I challenge you to meet me

14:30.769 --> 14:32.471
in the field of honor...

14:33.472 --> 14:37.243
for the hand of
Lady Baden-Baden.

14:40.579 --> 14:44.049
You look wonderful,
no matter who you marry.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.252
Oh, I think it's romantic.

14:46.252 --> 14:51.123
Imagine, Mr. Knox sending
you roses all these years!

14:51.123 --> 14:54.727
Lady B-B: And I never
knew who they were from!

14:54.727 --> 14:56.562
I always thought it was my

14:56.562 --> 14:59.265
flower-of-the-month club
selection!

14:59.265 --> 15:02.234
If only he'd told me!

15:02.234 --> 15:04.270
Who do you hope wins?

15:04.270 --> 15:07.139
Lady B-B: Ooh!
It's so difficult!

15:07.139 --> 15:10.509
Mr. Knox is so, so... you know,

15:10.509 --> 15:13.479
and Mr. Sneer, well he's just...

15:14.013 --> 15:16.115
he's just... you know.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.583
We sure do!

15:18.651 --> 15:21.420
We can't let the boss
go through with this.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.956
It's a fate worse than death!

15:23.956 --> 15:26.859
Pig 2: Oohh! What will we do?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.295
Pig 1: Appeal to his
better judgement?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.564
Pig 1: Why, the ring alone boss!

15:32.564 --> 15:34.633
Pig 2: That's $40,000

15:34.633 --> 15:35.801
for a good one.

15:35.801 --> 15:39.271
Pig 2: Oh, here's a nice
honeymoon spot, boss!

15:39.271 --> 15:41.373
Pig 3: One week, all inclusive,

15:41.373 --> 15:43.108
fruit basket in your room...

15:43.108 --> 15:46.011
Pig 2:
Only #10,000 for one week!

15:46.011 --> 15:50.549
Pig 3: The honeymoon of a
lifetime in the Porkinos.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.952
Pig 2: Don't forget the
cost of the reception.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
Pig 1: And of course boss,
she'll only own

15:54.954 --> 15:56.989
half of all your assets!

15:56.989 --> 15:58.891
Half! Stop!

15:58.891 --> 16:00.459
I've had enough!

16:00.459 --> 16:03.329
Pig 3: Why don't you
just call her, boss?

16:03.329 --> 16:05.497
Tell her that there's
been a big mistake.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.736
WHAT?!?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.240
Mammoth Assistant: Mr. Mammoth,
speaking as a dear friend

16:15.240 --> 16:17.242
of Lady Baden-Baden,

16:17.242 --> 16:20.746
hopes you will win
her hand in marriage.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.048
Thanks, I'm touched!

16:23.048 --> 16:24.917
Mr. Mammoth says,

16:24.917 --> 16:28.654
that although you're a very
poor choice for a husband,

16:28.654 --> 16:33.592
you are a great deal more
acceptable than Mr. Knox.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.728
I'm touched. Twice!

16:38.230 --> 16:40.065
Mr. Mammoth says,

16:40.065 --> 16:44.603
the bottom line is,
no marriage, no merger.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.039
Is that clear, Sneer?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.376
He he!
W-where did you say...

16:50.376 --> 16:52.578
was a good spot
for the honeymoon?

16:55.447 --> 16:57.716
Why do they always
have to have these things

16:57.716 --> 16:59.451
at the crack of dawn?

16:59.451 --> 17:00.753
It's tradition.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.888
And since I've been
appointed judge,

17:02.888 --> 17:06.025
I'd like to make sure that
everything runs by the book.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.561
There are three trials
to choose from.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.898
Trial by fire, air and water.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.234
Lady Baden-Baden,

17:15.234 --> 17:16.769
will you draw one from the hat?

17:18.137 --> 17:20.439
Lady B-B: Trial by water!

17:20.439 --> 17:23.942
Oh, that sounds so exciting!

17:25.711 --> 17:28.080
Mr. Knox: My element ma'am!

17:28.080 --> 17:31.650
And I assure you
I shall return...

17:31.650 --> 17:33.652
triumphant!

17:36.755 --> 17:38.290
Lady B-B: Ooohhh!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.658
Ooh-oooh!

17:41.060 --> 17:42.628
According to the rules,

17:42.628 --> 17:46.498
the first challenger to find a
rare Evergreen Lake clam pearl

17:46.498 --> 17:49.234
and return, is the winner.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.670
Good luck, gentlemen.
Good luck, Pop!

17:52.471 --> 17:55.908
Lady B-B: Ooh, don't
they look dashing!

17:56.442 --> 18:00.112
Pop must really be in
love with Lady Baden-Baden.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.247
He doesn't even
know how to swim.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.138
They've been down
there an awfully long time!

18:26.138 --> 18:29.775
Pig 2: This is our last chance
to make sure the boss loses!

18:29.775 --> 18:31.643
Turn down his air pressure.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.312
That should slow him up!

18:33.312 --> 18:35.948
Pig 3: The boss will
thank us for this!

18:44.990 --> 18:46.325
Pig 3: Oh no!

18:46.325 --> 18:47.860
The boss is in trouble!

18:47.860 --> 18:51.063
Oohh! Quick!
Turn up the air pressure!

19:02.774 --> 19:04.209
Pig 1: It's a bird!

19:04.209 --> 19:05.644
Pig 2: It's a plane!

19:06.178 --> 19:07.479
Pig 3: Noooo!

19:07.479 --> 19:10.048
It's Super Clam!

19:10.048 --> 19:12.017
Aaaaaaahhhh!

19:16.655 --> 19:17.856
Oohh!

19:17.856 --> 19:20.159
A winner!

19:21.426 --> 19:23.562
Mr. Knox: Well, I reckon

19:23.562 --> 19:25.898
the better man won.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.668
Congratulations, Mr. Sneer.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.603
I hope you'll be...

19:31.603 --> 19:33.438
very happy.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.575
Lady B-B: I'll never,...

19:36.575 --> 19:38.877
never forget you, Cyril.

19:41.947 --> 19:45.083
Mr. Knox: Huh? M-M-My lady!

19:45.083 --> 19:47.085
I-I...

19:47.085 --> 19:48.554
don't understand.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.590
Lady B-B:
Dear Cyril, forgive me.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.258
You see, once I learned that

19:53.258 --> 19:55.861
Mr. Knox had loved me all these years,

19:55.861 --> 19:59.598
I realized that I too loved him.

19:59.598 --> 20:02.034
I do hope you understand.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.437
Sure. Sure, I understand.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.440
I only want what's best for you.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.776
Good luck!...To both of you.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.979
Hey Knox! Hope you like pink!

20:17.082 --> 20:19.218
Pop! Pop! Wait up!

20:20.719 --> 20:22.154
I tried son.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.623
I tried my best for you.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.059
I really wanted you
to have someone.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.728
Someone who could
be a mother to you.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.598
I'm sorry.
For me?

20:32.598 --> 20:34.833
But I'm sorry for you!

20:34.833 --> 20:36.835
I thought you wanted a wife!

20:36.835 --> 20:39.438
I was being happy... for you!

20:39.438 --> 20:42.140
You mean, you're not sad?

20:42.140 --> 20:43.642
Heck no, Pop!

20:43.642 --> 20:47.212
I mean, Lady Baden-Baden
was nice, but...

20:47.813 --> 20:49.615
not as a mother.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.516
Besides Pop,

20:51.516 --> 20:53.752
I couldn't have a better mother

20:53.752 --> 20:56.421
and father... than you!

20:56.421 --> 20:58.790
You... you mean that?

20:58.790 --> 20:59.958
Sure, Pop.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.961
We make a great team,
just the two of us!

21:02.961 --> 21:05.364
'Til the right lady comes along.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.965
Wo-would you...

21:06.965 --> 21:09.635
like to hear about...
your mother?

21:09.635 --> 21:11.637
I sure would, Pop.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.373
She was a,
a wonderful lady, son.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.475
Ooh!
I loved her!

21:16.475 --> 21:18.510
She really knew
how to make money!
