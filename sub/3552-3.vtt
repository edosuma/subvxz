WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.333
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.333 --> 00:04.405
TOM MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.037
TOM AND I ARE SEPARATING.

00:06.037 --> 00:07.078
NO.

00:07.078 --> 00:08.539
AFTER COVERING UP A MURDER,

00:08.539 --> 00:12.513
GABY WARNED BREE
IT WAS A BAD TIME

00:12.513 --> 00:14.045
TO BE DATING A COP.

00:14.045 --> 00:15.286
GET RID OF CHUCK.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO END THIS,

00:15.286 --> 00:17.218
AND YOU'VE GOT TO END IT NOW.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.420
BREE SHOWED
THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER TO PAUL,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.692
WHO'D SEEN ONE LIKE IT BEFORE.

00:21.692 --> 00:23.724
I MENTIONED THE LETTER
TO THE POLICE.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.356
The main detective was
a tall guy

00:25.356 --> 00:27.298
WITH A SHORT NAME LIKE, UH,
PENCE.

00:27.298 --> 00:30.331
WAS IT VANCE? CHUCK VANCE?
 THAT'S IT.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.632
CARLOS STRUGGLED
WITH REMORSE...

00:31.632 --> 00:33.564
I JUST WANT US TO GET BACK
TO NORMAL.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.336
WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK
TO NORMAL!

00:35.336 --> 00:38.239
AND DISCOVERED HE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE FEELING GUILTY.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.312
IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:41.312 --> 00:43.314
YOU WANNA GET SOME COFFEE?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.322
(Mary Alice)
SUSAN DELFINO AND CARLOS SOLIS

00:51.322 --> 00:54.555
HAD NEVER BEEN
THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.388
SUSAN THOUGHT CARLOS
PAID TOO MUCH ATTENTION

00:57.388 --> 00:59.760
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.392
(splash)

01:01.392 --> 01:06.097
AND CARLOS THOUGHT SUSAN
DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION AT ALL.

01:07.538 --> 01:12.143
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'D NEVER
HAD MUCH TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER.

01:12.143 --> 01:16.207
BUT ONE NIGHT, SUSAN FOUND
HERSELF TROUBLED BY THOUGHTS

01:16.207 --> 01:19.780
SHE COULDN'T SHARE
WITH HER SPOUSE.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.582
WHILE TWO DOORS DOWN,

01:21.582 --> 01:25.816
CARLOS
WAS IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT.

01:25.816 --> 01:29.690
AND THAT'S HOW IT CAME TO PASS

01:29.690 --> 01:34.165
THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO'D NEVER
HAD MUCH TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER

01:34.165 --> 01:37.368
SUDDENLY FOUND...

01:37.368 --> 01:40.701
THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL
TO TALK ABOUT.

01:40.701 --> 01:45.105
SO I LEAVE THE OFFICE,
WALK INTO THE PARKING GARAGE,

01:45.105 --> 01:48.379
AND... THERE HE IS.

01:48.379 --> 01:50.211
ALEJANDRO.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.442
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

01:51.442 --> 01:53.514
I PRACTICALLY JUMP
OUT OF MY SKIN.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.287
THEN I TURN AROUND AGAIN.

01:56.287 --> 01:58.519
IT'S JUST SOME GUY
GETTING INTO HIS CAR.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.121
THIS IS NOT ME.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.354
I CAN'T SLEEP.
I'M SEEING GHOSTS.

02:03.354 --> 02:05.356
(sighs) I FEEL LIKE...

02:05.356 --> 02:08.127
I'M WALKING AROUND WITH
A NEON SIGN ON MY FOREHEAD,

02:08.127 --> 02:10.300
FLASHING "GUILTY, GUILTY,"

02:10.300 --> 02:12.363
AND EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT.

02:12.363 --> 02:14.765
SOMETIMES I THINK
I'M LOSING IT.

02:14.765 --> 02:16.637
ME, TOO.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.769
I WAS GETTING READY
TO DECK THE GUY.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.411
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

02:20.411 --> 02:24.275
CAN I IMAGINE?
I ASSAULTED A COP, REMEMBER?

02:24.275 --> 02:27.718
OH, YEAH.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?

02:27.718 --> 02:30.181
15 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

02:30.181 --> 02:31.322
OUCH.

02:31.322 --> 02:32.623
AND I CAN'T TELL MIKE.

02:32.623 --> 02:35.356
IT'S ONE MORE THING
I'M LYING TO HIM ABOUT.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.459
WELL, ICANTALK TO GABY,
BUT SHE'S SICK OF LISTENING.

02:38.459 --> 02:43.294
THAT'S WHAT THIS MAKES THIS
FEEL SO...

02:45.896 --> 02:47.938
I KNOW.

02:50.341 --> 02:53.544
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

02:53.544 --> 02:57.348
WHEN I WENT OUT
WALKING TONIGHT,

02:57.348 --> 02:59.750
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
I'D RUN INTO YOU.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.212
(chuckles)

03:03.384 --> 03:05.386
I WAS KINDA HOPING THAT,
TOO.

03:10.561 --> 03:14.495
YOU'RE KIDDING. YOU'VE NEVER
READ "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD"?

03:14.495 --> 03:15.666
IN MY SCHOOL,
IF YOU READ A BOOK,

03:15.666 --> 03:17.528
IT WAS MORE LIKE
"TO KILL A SOPHOMORE."

03:17.528 --> 03:18.799
(laughs)

03:18.799 --> 03:22.803
WELL, YOU WOULD LOVE IT.
UM, IT'S ABOUT A GUY

03:22.803 --> 03:27.438
WHO TRIES TO HANG ON
TO HIS SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG

03:27.438 --> 03:29.740
WHEN THE SYSTEM FAILS HIM.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.442
GEE, I DON'T GET THAT
AT ALL.

03:31.442 --> 03:33.484
HMM. (chuckles)

03:33.484 --> 03:37.388
OH. YOUR JACKET. THANK YOU.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.320
MM-HMM.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.452
YES, SUSAN AND CARLOS

03:41.452 --> 03:43.794
WERE STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION
TO ONE ANOTHER.

03:43.794 --> 03:45.856
GOOD NIGHT.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.301
BUT WHAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE

03:50.301 --> 03:55.406
WAS THAT SOMEONE ELSE
WAS PAYING ATTENTION, TOO.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.581
WISTERIA LANE
MAYLOOKFLAWLESS,

04:10.581 --> 04:12.783
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
ITS RESIDENTS

04:12.783 --> 04:17.827
ARE SO GOOD
AT CONCEALING IMPERFECTIONS.

04:17.827 --> 04:22.863
THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE
SOMETHING OLD LOOK NEW AGAIN...

04:22.863 --> 04:28.268
HOW TO MAKE AN EMBARRASSING
MISTAKE DISAPPEAR...

04:28.268 --> 04:33.604
HOW TO MAKE A POOR SHOWING
LOOK LIKE A MODEST VICTORY...

04:33.604 --> 04:36.507
AND HOW TO MAKE A FRIEND
FEEL BETTER

04:36.507 --> 04:40.050
AFTER SHE'S GONE
THROUGH A MESSY BREAKUP.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.613
GABY, HOW THOUGHTFUL.

04:42.613 --> 04:43.714
IT'S FROM THAT NEW PLACE,
SKINNY BERRY.

04:43.714 --> 04:45.956
TASTES LIKE A MILKSHAKE
BUT ONLY 18 CALORIES.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.661
AND I FIGURED YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE PICK-ME-UP

04:50.661 --> 04:52.623
AFTER YOU DUMPED CHUCK.

04:52.623 --> 04:55.526
YEAH, WELL, ABOUT THAT...

04:55.526 --> 04:57.598
MORNING, WOMEN.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.602
MORNING.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.833
OH, IS THAT--
IS THAT FROM SKINNY BERRY?

05:02.833 --> 05:05.506
YOU KNOW, THE FRAUD UNIT'S
ALL OVER THAT PLACE, RIGHT?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.378
APPARENTLY THOSE THINGS
ARE LIKE PURE ICE CREAM.

05:07.378 --> 05:10.741
HUH! GUESS YOU CAN'T
TRUST ANYBODY.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.784
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.989
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY--

05:18.989 --> 05:20.821
THREE WORDS--
FIRST WORD, "YOU'RE,"

05:20.821 --> 05:22.092
THIRD WORD, "CRAZY,"

05:22.092 --> 05:24.625
MIDDLE WORD--WHAT YOU KEEP
DOING TO THAT GUY!

05:24.625 --> 05:25.496
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:25.496 --> 05:26.757
DAMN RIGHT I DON'T.

05:26.757 --> 05:28.629
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA DUMP HIM.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.401
I WAS.

05:30.401 --> 05:33.864
BUT... I THINK
CHUCK WROTE THE LETTER.

05:33.864 --> 05:37.037
THE "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"
LETTER?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.639
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

05:38.639 --> 05:39.870
I SPOKE TO PAUL YOUNG, AND--

05:39.870 --> 05:41.542
WHOA, WHOA.
WHY WOULD YOU TALK TO PAUL?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.445
TO FIND OUT WHO ELSE KNEW
ABOUT MARY ALICE'S LETTER,

05:44.445 --> 05:45.616
AND HE SAID THAT
WHEN HE CONFESSED

05:45.616 --> 05:49.349
TO KILLING MARTHA HUBER,
CHUCK WAS THERE.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.123
OKAY, BUT WHY WOULD
CHUCK BLACKMAIL YOU?

05:53.123 --> 05:55.486
HE'S ALREADY GOT
THE MILK AND THE COW.

05:55.486 --> 05:58.429
NO OFFENSE.
JUST WHAT ELSE COULD HE WANT?

05:58.429 --> 05:59.630
MAYBE HE WANTS TO CONTROL ME.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.032
MAYBE HE WANTS MONEY.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:02.032 --> 06:04.435
YOU'VE GOTTA START SNOOPING.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.136
WHAT?
 YEAH. GO THROUGH HIS STUFF,

06:06.136 --> 06:08.899
HACK INTO HIS E-MAILS,
LISTEN IN ON HIS PHONE CALLS.

06:08.899 --> 06:09.900
I CAN'T DO THAT.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.542
YOU HAVE TO, BREE.

06:11.542 --> 06:14.405
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT CHUCK KNOWS--
 EXACTLYWHAT HE KNOWS,

06:14.405 --> 06:15.806
IT'S NOT JUST YOU
WHO'S IN DANGER.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.678
IT'S ALL OF US.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.853
(sighs)

06:25.115 --> 06:26.156
HOW'S THAT PRESSURE?

06:26.156 --> 06:29.590
OHH, PERFECT,
AND REMEMBER, FRIEDRICH,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.822
I'VE HIDDEN YOUR TIP
SOMEWHERE ON MY BODY.

06:31.822 --> 06:34.695
(singsongy)
IT'S UP TO YOU TO FIND IT.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.726
AHH.

06:35.726 --> 06:36.797
(doorbell rings)

06:36.797 --> 06:38.098
GO AWAY!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.600
RENEE! I NEED YOU.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.802
(door closes)
 LEE?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.103
I AM IN CRISIS.
I AM AT MY WIT'S--

06:43.103 --> 06:45.175
WELL, HELLO. (chuckles)

06:45.175 --> 06:47.438
LEE McDERMOTT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:47.438 --> 06:48.539
I'M FRIEDRICH.

06:48.539 --> 06:50.641
OOH, LIKE IN
"THE SOUND OF MUSIC"?

06:52.012 --> 06:54.915
NOTHING? OKAY.
HE PLAYS FOR YOUR TEAM.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.747
ANYWAY,
I NEED A HUGE FAVOR.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.619
I DON'T DO FAVORS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.990
IT'S FOR JENNY.

06:59.990 --> 07:01.151
OH, YOUR DAUGHTER?

07:01.151 --> 07:02.693
YEAH.
 NO.

07:02.693 --> 07:05.195
OH,PLEASE.

07:05.195 --> 07:06.927
I AM DESPERATE.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.629
WHEN BOB AND I ADOPTED HER,

07:08.629 --> 07:11.001
WE AGREED THAT I WOULD TAKE CARE
OF THE "TIME OF THE MONTH" TALK,

07:11.001 --> 07:13.203
AND BOB WOULD HANDLE
ALL THINGS BRA.

07:13.203 --> 07:15.005
WELL,
THAT BASTARD IS IN TOKYO,

07:15.005 --> 07:17.107
AND THE BOOBIE FAIRY
HAS ARRIVED.

07:17.107 --> 07:19.470
THE BOOBIE FAIRY?

07:19.470 --> 07:21.742
SEE WHY I SHOULD NOT BE
THE ONE HANDLING THIS?

07:21.742 --> 07:25.546
I WAS HOPING... MAYBE YOU
COULD TAKE HER SHOPPING?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.718
OH, MAN UP. IT'S JUST A BRA.

07:27.718 --> 07:29.049
THEY TERRIFY ME.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.682
TOO MANY NUMBERS
AND LETTERS AND COLORS,

07:31.682 --> 07:33.153
AND IT'S MY LITTLE GIRL
GROWING UP,

07:33.153 --> 07:36.787
AND I CAN'T DEAL.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.859
OHH, YES.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.791
SO YOU'LL DO IT?

07:40.791 --> 07:43.233
NO, HE JUST FOUND HIS TIP.

07:43.233 --> 07:44.935
UGH!

07:44.935 --> 07:46.036
RENEE!

07:46.036 --> 07:48.699
FINE. I'LL TAKE HER,
BUT ONLY FOR AN HOUR,

07:48.699 --> 07:49.770
AND NO SMALL TALK.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.141
OH, BLESS YOU.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.974
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
FOR THIS. MWAH.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.577
LOOK! RICKY MARTIN!
EATING A BANANA!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.781
JUST CHECKING.

08:04.755 --> 08:08.559
OH, PLEASE COME WITH US.
YOU'VE BRA SHOPPED WITH PENNY.

08:08.559 --> 08:09.790
AND MAYBE ONE
OF YOUR OLDER BOYS,

08:09.790 --> 08:11.121
IF I'M GUESSING RIGHT.

08:11.121 --> 08:12.663
I CAN'T. I HAVE PLANS.

08:12.663 --> 08:14.795
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
TOM'S GOT THE KIDS,

08:14.795 --> 08:16.967
AND YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE PLACE
TO YOURSELF.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.829
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

08:18.829 --> 08:21.001
OH, SWEETIE.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.502
SOME MAN WHO'S NOT
MARRIED TO YOU

08:22.502 --> 08:24.905
IS GONNA HAVE TO SEE
THAT BODY SOON. DO NOT DO THIS.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.838
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
MY SISTER'S COMING.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.680
LYDIA? THE DISASTER?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.542
YEAH. OUT OF THE BLUE,
SHE CALLED

08:31.542 --> 08:34.144
AND SAYS SHE WANTS TO VISIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

08:34.144 --> 08:35.145
SHE GOT DUMPED.

08:35.145 --> 08:36.616
AFTER LOANING HIM
A LOT OF MONEY.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.847
AND FINDING OUT
HE'S MARRIED.

08:37.847 --> 08:41.652
IN TWO STATES. SO... I GOTTA
GET THE WHOLE TOOLKIT READY

08:41.652 --> 08:45.626
SO AFTER SHE CRASH-LANDS HERE,
I CAN PICK UP THE PIECES.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.728
(doorbell rings)
 UH, I'M GOING OUT
THE BACK DOOR.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.060
I HATE TO SEE PEOPLE CRYING.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.763
IT REMINDS ME HOW LITTLE
I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT OTHERS.

08:52.763 --> 08:54.004
(ring)

08:54.004 --> 08:56.807
(sighs) COMING!

08:58.138 --> 08:59.740
OH, HI.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.071
LYNNIE.
 OHH.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.213
YOU LOOK...

09:03.213 --> 09:04.845
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.077
YOU THOUGHT I'D BE
MY USUAL BLUBBERY MESS

09:07.077 --> 09:09.119
OF SNOT AND TEARS,
DIDN'T YOU?

09:09.119 --> 09:10.851
WHAT? NO.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.053
WELL, THAT'S NOT ME ANYMORE.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.786
THANKS TO RASHI,
I'M A CHANGED WOMAN.

09:15.786 --> 09:19.159
RASHI? OH, GOD.
DID YOU GET A DOG?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.832
NO, SILLY. I GOT ENGAGED

09:21.832 --> 09:25.095
TO THE GREATEST GUY
IN THE WORLD.

09:27.137 --> 09:33.273
OH, AND, LYNETTE, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOU AND TOM.

09:33.273 --> 09:37.047
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.914
(sighs)

09:43.914 --> 09:45.986
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.888
GROCERY STORE
WAS A MADHOUSE.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.991
I ACTUALLY HAD TO FIGHT
A WOMAN OVER THE LAST CHICKEN.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.723
SUSAN--
 UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE WAS SLAVIC--

09:52.723 --> 09:56.366
A VERY STURDY PEOPLE,
SO I HOPE YOU LIKE CEREAL.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.929
SUSAN, STOP.
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE

09:58.929 --> 10:00.370
WITH THE GUY FROM THE COUNTY.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.073
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR
COURT-ORDERED COMMUNITY SERVICE

10:03.073 --> 10:04.735
FOR ASSAULTING A POLICEMAN.

10:04.735 --> 10:08.008
OH. THAT.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.240
YEAH, THAT.

10:12.683 --> 10:14.885
W--IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

10:14.885 --> 10:18.088
I WAS... TRYING TO FIGHT
A... PARKING TICKET,

10:18.088 --> 10:20.020
AND I KNOCKED
OVER THE COP'S BIKE.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.193
UM, AND I MAYBE TOLD HIM
HIS BABY WAS UGLY.

10:23.193 --> 10:26.626
HE--HE BLEW THE WHOLE THING
OUT OF PROPORTION.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.228
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M BLOWING OUT OF PROPORTION?

10:28.228 --> 10:32.102
THE GUY ON THE PHONE
CALLED ME "MR. SOLIS."

10:32.102 --> 10:35.005
RIGHT.

10:35.005 --> 10:38.068
BECAUSE, UM...

10:38.068 --> 10:41.812
CARLOS PICKED ME UP
AT THE, UH, POLICE STATION,

10:41.812 --> 10:43.874
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS WEIRD--

10:43.874 --> 10:46.877
WHY HIM AND NOT YOU...

10:48.949 --> 10:51.922
I WAS JUST, UH,
SO EMBARRASSED,

10:51.922 --> 10:54.685
I-I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU.

10:56.927 --> 10:59.259
SO THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
WITH YOU AND CARLOS?

10:59.259 --> 11:02.132
(chuckles)

11:02.132 --> 11:03.864
I SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED

11:03.864 --> 11:07.337
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE
MOONLIGHT STROLL LAST NIGHT?

11:07.337 --> 11:10.200
WOW! (chuckles)

11:10.200 --> 11:12.272
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING
FIGHTING LESSONS

11:12.272 --> 11:15.005
FROM THAT SLAVIC LADY?
(chuckles)

11:15.005 --> 11:17.047
MIKE, COME ON.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.079
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
CARLOS COULDN'T SLEEP.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.712
WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER,
AND WE TALKED.

11:21.712 --> 11:23.784
ABOUT WHAT?
YOU BARELY KNOW HIM.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.085
THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS
WE LIVED HERE,

11:25.085 --> 11:26.857
YOU CALLED HIM
RICKY RICARDO.

11:26.857 --> 11:31.191
HE'S...
GOING THROUGH SOMETHING,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.223
AND I'M HELPING HIM.

11:33.223 --> 11:36.396
YEAH? TELL ME.
WHAT'S HE GOING THROUGH?

11:38.929 --> 11:40.931
IT'S PERSONAL.

11:42.933 --> 11:46.006
OKAY, MIKE,CARLOS AND I
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.038
I DON'T MIND YOU
BEING FRIENDS WITH A GUY.

11:48.038 --> 11:50.240
IT'S ALL THE SNEAKING AROUND
AND THE LYING

11:50.240 --> 11:53.914
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH.

12:02.793 --> 12:04.124
SO SHE WALTZES IN
TO MY ADVANCED YOGA CLASS

12:04.124 --> 12:06.156
EVEN THOUGH, CLEARLY,
SHE'S NEVER DONE YOGA BEFORE.

12:06.156 --> 12:07.998
WELL, THE TEACHER
OF THE BEGINNER'S CLASS

12:07.998 --> 12:09.760
WASN'T NEARLY AS CUTE
AS YOU.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.032
AND THEN I, UH, GO OVER

12:12.032 --> 12:14.905
AND CORRECT HER COBBLER POSE,
RIGHT?

12:14.905 --> 12:17.337
AND OUR EYES MEET.

12:17.337 --> 12:21.171
AND THREE WEEKS LATER,
HE GIVES ME THIS.

12:21.171 --> 12:22.973
WOW, THAT'S SOME ROCK.

12:22.973 --> 12:25.776
LITERALLY, IT'S A ROCK.

12:25.776 --> 12:27.477
I SAW IT ON THE BEACH
AFTER CLASS.

12:27.477 --> 12:32.152
IT CALLS OUT TO ME, AND I FEEL
LIKE I MIGHT NEED IT SOMEDAY.

12:32.152 --> 12:36.026
AND YOU DID.
ISN'T THE UNIVERSE AMAZING?

12:36.026 --> 12:37.988
AMAZINGLY THRIFTY.

12:37.988 --> 12:40.430
OKAY.

12:40.430 --> 12:42.062
SO THIS IS MY THIRD GLASS.
(clears throat)

12:42.062 --> 12:44.534
I'M SAYING MEAN THINGS,
BUT I'M NOT GETTING A BUZZ.

12:44.534 --> 12:47.167
THE WINE IS ALCOHOL-FREE.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.970
SO THIS NIGHT'S NOT GETTING
ANY BETTER.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.501
EVER SINCE RASHI DID
A LIVER CLEANSE ON ME,

12:51.501 --> 12:53.073
I HAVEN'T HAD A DROP
TO DRINK.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.405
WOW.

12:55.405 --> 12:57.277
YOU GOT LYDIA TO GIVE UP WINE?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.179
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR ACT
TO VEGAS.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.151
IT'S NOT AN ACT.

13:01.151 --> 13:04.284
I'M GONNA GO GRAB SOME SPICES
OUT OF THE VAN.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.385
MMM.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.556
MMM.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
(door opens and closes)

13:12.192 --> 13:15.025
OKAY, WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:15.025 --> 13:17.067
YOU CAN'T MARRY
THAT SUNFLOWER SEED.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.069
I'M NOT KIDDING ANYBODY.

13:19.069 --> 13:21.201
I LOVE HIM.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.403
IN FACT, HE'S LEADING
A MEDITATION SEMINAR...

13:23.403 --> 13:25.005
(bottle cap fizzes)

13:25.005 --> 13:26.276
AT KERRIGAN PARK.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.108
WHY DON'T YOU COME?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.540
IT MIGHT HELP YOU DEAL
WITH YOUR MARRIAGE CRASHING.

13:31.982 --> 13:34.544
MY MARRIAGE DID NOT CRASH.
TOM AND I ARE SEPARATED.

13:34.544 --> 13:37.087
EXACTLY WHY YOU SHOULD BE
DOING SOME "LYNETTE WORK."

13:37.087 --> 13:39.089
COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

13:39.089 --> 13:42.552
SIX HOURS OF SILENCE
IN A TRADITIONAL MOUNTAIN YURT.

13:42.552 --> 13:47.097
I PROMISE YOU, LYDIA,
IF YOU DRAG ME TO AYURT,

13:47.097 --> 13:49.129
TWO WILL GO IN,
ONE WILL COME OUT.

13:52.402 --> 13:56.236
(man shouts indistinctly
in distance)

13:56.236 --> 13:57.908
(man) HEY.

13:57.908 --> 13:59.940
CAREFUL. THAT'S OUR TAX DOLLARS
YOU'RE DRIPPING.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.112
SORRY.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.214
YOU NEED TO PACE YOURSELF.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED LOTS OF PAINT

14:04.214 --> 14:08.048
TO COVER THAT GIGANTIC BANANA
OVER THERE.

14:08.048 --> 14:11.551
UH... I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A BANANA.

14:17.327 --> 14:20.330
HEY, I WORKED HARD
ON THAT GRAFFITI.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.232
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:22.232 --> 14:25.635
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."

14:25.635 --> 14:27.267
I STARTED READING IT
LAST NIGHT.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.499
IT WAS SO GOOD. I COULDN'T
WAIT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

14:29.499 --> 14:31.401
YEAH, WELL, I'M KINDA
BEAUTIFYING THE CITY

14:31.401 --> 14:32.572
AT THE MOMENT.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.244
DON'T YOU GET A LUNCH?
(chuckles)

14:34.244 --> 14:36.907
(chuckles) UM...

14:36.907 --> 14:40.150
LOOK, CARLOS, MIKE FOUND OUT
WE WERE SPENDING TIME TOGETHER,

14:40.150 --> 14:42.512
AND HE'S A LITTLE WEIRD
ABOUT IT,

14:42.512 --> 14:46.156
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
HAVING ANY INTIMATE LUNCHES.

14:46.156 --> 14:49.419
WHY IS HE WEIRD?
I MEAN, NOTHING'S GOING ON.

14:49.419 --> 14:53.123
NO, OF COURSE NOT,
BUT SOMEHOW...

14:53.123 --> 14:54.294
US MEETING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

14:54.294 --> 14:59.499
AND ME LYING ABOUT IT
WAS KIND OF A RED FLAG FOR HIM.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.202
OKAY.(chuckles)

15:02.202 --> 15:05.175
WELL, IF LUNCH
IS TOO INTIMATE...

15:06.937 --> 15:09.679
HOW ABOUT...
I HELP WITH THE BEAUTIFYING?

15:09.679 --> 15:13.283
I GUESS THERE'S NO HARM
IN THAT. (chuckles)

15:13.283 --> 15:15.145
(man) EXCUSE ME.

15:15.145 --> 15:16.586
ARE YOU HERE
FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE?

15:16.586 --> 15:19.219
NOPE, JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.992
CAN'T. NOT UNLESS
YOU COMMITTED A CRIME.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.225
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.157
YEAH.

15:32.162 --> 15:34.134
THERE.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.565
I LITTERED.

15:43.113 --> 15:44.314
(chuckles)

15:44.314 --> 15:46.316
JENNY, TRUST ME.

15:46.316 --> 15:48.478
YOU WANT JACKSON
TO NOTICE YOU, ICE HIM OUT.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.650
DON'T TALK TO HIM.
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.223
MAYBE HAVE SEX
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.955
I MEAN, HAVE A SODA.
GOT IT?

15:55.955 --> 15:56.956
TOTES.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.188
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

15:58.188 --> 15:59.689
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK
TWO HOURS AGO.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.262
UH, WE WENT SHOPPING.
HERE'S YOUR CREDIT CARD.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.034
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
I UPPED YOUR LIMIT.

16:04.034 --> 16:06.336
3 GRAND?
WHAT ARE YOU, A NURSE?

16:06.336 --> 16:08.198
SO... TELL ME
ALL ABOUT YOUR DAY.

16:08.198 --> 16:11.341
O.M.G. I WANT TO SEE
EVERYTHING YOU BOUGHT.

16:11.341 --> 16:14.304
DAD, YOU'RE LIKE A MILLION YEARS
TOO OLD FOR "O.M.G."

16:16.346 --> 16:18.278
I'M GONNA TRY
THE MAKEUP YOU GOT ME.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.250
WAIT. YOU GOT HER MAKEUP?

16:20.250 --> 16:21.551
SHE'S 11.

16:21.551 --> 16:23.013
UH, SHE WEARS A BRA NOW.

16:23.013 --> 16:25.185
THINK SHE'S READY
FOR STRAWBERRY LIP GLOSS.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.687
(singsongy) TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENS WITH JACKSON.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.419
(normal voice)
I WANT ALL THE DEETS.

16:29.419 --> 16:32.122
"DEETS." I LOVE YOU.

16:33.723 --> 16:37.397
WELL, LOOK AT YOU TWO,
ALL B.F.F.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.300
SO WHO'S THIS JACKSON?
I WOULD LIKE THOSE DEETS.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.133
OH, SHE ASKED ME NOT
TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT HIM.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.505
I'M NOT ANYONE.
I'M HER CO-FATHER.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
WELL, DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.139
THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS
GIRLS WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT

16:49.139 --> 16:51.041
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.282
(high-pitched voice)
I COULD BE A GIRL.

16:52.282 --> 16:53.513
I COULD TOTALLY BE A GIRL!

16:53.513 --> 16:56.546
WELL, YOU GOT THE VOICE DOWN.

16:59.689 --> 17:02.192
(sizzling)

17:02.192 --> 17:04.094
(Chuck)
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?

17:04.094 --> 17:07.426
IN THE KITCHEN!
COME JOIN ME.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.329
(knob clicks)

17:09.329 --> 17:12.402
SMELLS AMAZING.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

17:12.402 --> 17:15.435
OH, SEARED TILAPIA,
BEARNAISE SABAYON,

17:15.435 --> 17:16.736
AND A LITTLE BOK CHOY.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.338
MIND GIVING ME A HAND?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.441
BREE, THE ONLY WORD I RECOGNIZED
IN THAT SENTENCE WAS "HAND."

17:21.441 --> 17:24.344
COME ON. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.
THIS IS BEARNAISE SAUCE.

17:24.344 --> 17:29.079
IT JUST NEEDS TEN MINUTES
OF CONSTANT WHISKING.

17:29.079 --> 17:30.480
CONSTANT.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.723
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

17:33.723 --> 17:37.387
I'M GONNA GO DRESS
FOR DINNER.

17:37.387 --> 17:39.829
NOW REMEMBER,
KEEP WHISKING FOR TEN MINUTES.

17:39.829 --> 17:44.134
IF YOUR HAND STARTS TO SPASM,
IT MEANS YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

17:47.537 --> 17:50.540
(breathing heavily)

17:59.579 --> 18:03.353
(exhales deeply)

18:07.187 --> 18:08.488
(latches click)

18:08.488 --> 18:10.460
(Chuck) BREE, I THINK
IT'S BEEN TEN MINUTES!

18:10.460 --> 18:12.292
NO! NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE!

18:12.292 --> 18:16.396
KEEP WHISKING
TILL IT'S LIGHT AND FROTHY!

18:34.184 --> 18:36.446
OKAY, I DON'T CARE
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN,

18:36.446 --> 18:38.748
THAT STUFF
AIN'T GETTING ANY FROTHIER.

18:41.791 --> 18:45.795
AND I GOT A CRAMP
IN MY SHOOTING HAND.

18:45.795 --> 18:49.499
SO IF A CRIMINAL GETS AWAY
TOMORROW, IT'LL BE YOUR FAULT.

18:49.499 --> 18:51.601
OH, WELL...
 (closes drawer)

18:51.601 --> 18:53.503
I'M SO SORRY.

18:53.503 --> 18:58.608
HERE. LET ME, UH,
MASSAGE IT FOR YOU.

18:58.608 --> 19:02.172
AH. (exhales deeply)

19:12.252 --> 19:13.683
HE TOOK A PICTURE OF YOUR HAND
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING?

19:13.683 --> 19:15.655
HOW CREEPY ISTHAT?
 I KNOW. WHY WOULD HE
DO SUCH A THING?

19:15.655 --> 19:19.229
OH, MY GOD.
 WHAT?

19:19.229 --> 19:21.561
HE MUST HAVE FOUND A HANDPRINT
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.892
HE PULLED YOUR PRINT
OFF THE PHOTO,

19:22.892 --> 19:24.464
AND THEY WERE A MATCH.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.566
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
 I DON'T KNOW.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.198
WELL, THEN WHAT'S
IN THE ENVELOPE?

19:28.198 --> 19:31.901
MAYBE THE CELL PHONE OR A PIECE
OF THE SHOVEL HANDLE.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.374
WHATEVER IT IS, THAT'S WHAT
HE'S GONNA USE TO NAIL US.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.675
WELL, WE HAVE TO GET
THAT ENVELOPE,

19:35.675 --> 19:38.778
AND I CAN'T KEEP DISTRACTING HIM
BY HAVING HIM STIR SAUCES.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.411
BY THE WAY, HIS BEARNAISE--
DISASTER.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.483
OKAY. TONIGHT WHEN
HE GETS HOME,

19:43.483 --> 19:45.355
YOU TAKE HIM
FOR A LONG WALK,

19:45.355 --> 19:46.786
LEAVE THE BACK DOOR OPEN,
AND I'LL DO THE REST.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.359
GOT IT. (sighs)

19:49.359 --> 19:51.861
(gasps) WHAT IF
THE BRIEFCASE IS LOCKED?

19:51.861 --> 19:54.494
I CAN PICK LOCKS. YEAH.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.467
I CAN ALSO DISGUISE MY VOICE,
FORGE PEOPLE'S SIGNATURES,

19:57.467 --> 19:58.968
AND I'M A DECENT PICKPOCKET.

19:58.968 --> 20:01.501
ADULTERY GAVE ME
SOME VALUABLE LIFE SKILLS.

20:04.574 --> 20:07.977
(sighs)
FRACTIONS ARE SO STUPID.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.440
I'M NEVER GONNA NEED
THIS STUFF ANYWAY.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.211
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

20:12.211 --> 20:16.416
LET'S SAY YOU MARRY A GUY
WHO'S WORTH $20 MILLION.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.788
YOU DIVORCE HIM,
AND HE GIVES YOU HALF,

20:18.788 --> 20:21.551
BUT YOUR PRENUP SAYS
YOU GET THREE-QUARTERS.

20:21.551 --> 20:24.454
THAT EXTRA $5 MILLION
GETS YOU A YACHT

20:24.454 --> 20:28.498
BECAUSE YOU LEARNED
YOUR FRACTIONS.

20:28.498 --> 20:29.759
TRUE STORY, BY THE WAY.

20:29.759 --> 20:32.262
(door opens)
 (Lee) HELLO? IT'S LEE!

20:32.262 --> 20:33.963
(door closes)
 HEY! COME ON UP.

20:33.963 --> 20:36.636
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE
A REALLY COOL MOM.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.509
YOU THINK SO?

20:39.509 --> 20:42.912
NO, I'D PROBABLY JUST LEAVE
THE KID IN A NIGHTCLUB

20:42.912 --> 20:45.244
OR... MOROCCO.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.846
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.548
WHAT AMIDOING HERE?
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER,

20:48.548 --> 20:50.950
WHO SAID SHE'D BE HOME BY 5:00.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.284
I GUESS WE GOT CARRIED AWAY.
 TOTES.

20:54.284 --> 20:57.457
USE THE WHOLE WORD!
HOW MUCH TIME ARE YOU SAVING?

20:57.457 --> 20:58.858
CALM DOWN.
 CAN YOU STAY OUT OF THIS?

20:58.858 --> 21:01.260
THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND MY DAUGHTER.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.363
STOP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.534
I DON'T CARE.

21:04.534 --> 21:07.266
YOU NEED TO COME HOME WITH ME...
NOW.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.399
WHAT IF I SAY
I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE?

21:09.399 --> 21:10.540
WHAT IF I SAY
YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR A WEEK?

21:10.540 --> 21:11.671
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING?

21:11.671 --> 21:14.604
WHAT?! (voice breaking)
YOU ARE SO UNFAIR!

21:19.409 --> 21:21.911
(sighs) AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON HER?

21:21.911 --> 21:24.954
BACK OFF, RENEE.
YOU'RE NOT HER MOTHER.

21:28.858 --> 21:33.623
MMM. MY SWEET, THAT WAS
YOUR MOST DELICIOUS MEAL YET.

21:33.623 --> 21:34.724
WHAT WAS IN THIS?

21:34.724 --> 21:36.696
UH, JUST WALNUTS, HEMP CURDS,

21:36.696 --> 21:39.599
AND ONE
VERY SPECIAL INGREDIENT.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.433
PLEASE DON'T SAY "LOVE,"
BECAUSE I'M ALREADY NAUSEOUS.

21:43.433 --> 21:45.635
I FIND THAT A WALK AFTER A MEAL

21:45.635 --> 21:48.638
HELPS ENCOURAGE
MY DIGESTIVE FLOW.

21:48.638 --> 21:49.779
ANYBODY CARE TO JOIN ME?

21:49.779 --> 21:51.981
YOU GO.
I'LL CLEAN UP.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.317
NO, LYNETTE!

21:58.317 --> 22:00.390
THAT'S FULL OF POISON.

22:00.390 --> 22:03.092
YES, DELICIOUS, CREAMY POISON,
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

22:03.092 --> 22:05.525
YOU USED TO SUCK DOWN
BY THE GALLON.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.097
YES, I KNOW,
BUT I'VE CHANGED.

22:08.097 --> 22:10.860
AND I WANNA HELP YOU CHANGE,
TOO. IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.862
WOW. THAT'S A BIGGER LOAD
OF CRAP

22:12.862 --> 22:14.634
THAN THE ONE WE JUST ATE.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.536
EXCUSE ME?

22:16.536 --> 22:19.769
YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR ME.
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE FOR ONCE,

22:19.769 --> 22:21.671
YOU'RETHE ONE
IN THE HAPPY RELATIONSHIP,

22:21.671 --> 22:25.375
AND YOU JUST COULDN'T WAIT
TO RUB MY FACE IN IT.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.916
HOW COULD--

22:26.916 --> 22:28.648
WHY DO YOU AL--NO.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.880
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.553
YOU WON'T DRAG ME DOWN
TO YOUR LEVEL.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.825
I AM SURROUNDED
BY A BEAUTIFUL BUBBLE

22:35.825 --> 22:37.627
OF LOVING ENERGY.

22:37.627 --> 22:39.529
YES, LYDIA,
YOU ARE IN A BUBBLE,

22:39.529 --> 22:43.663
BUT ONCE THE PEBBLE COLLECTOR
DUMPS YOU LIKE THEY ALL DO,

22:43.663 --> 22:45.965
YOU'LL GO RIGHT BACK TO BEING
THE ICE CREAM-BINGING,

22:45.965 --> 22:50.540
WINE-SWILLING, NEUROTIC MESS
YOU REALLY ARE. POP!

22:50.540 --> 22:54.404
YOU ARE SO MEAN.
GOD, IHATEYOU.

22:54.404 --> 22:56.676
THERE SHE IS. WELCOME BACK.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.377
MY WHOLE LIFE, YOU'VE TREATED ME
LIKE A SCREWUP.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.679
YOU ALWAYS HAD TO BE
THE HAPPY ONE,

22:59.679 --> 23:01.451
THE SMART ONE,
THE MARRIED ONE.

23:01.451 --> 23:04.884
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
NOWYOU'RETHE SCREWUP, BITCH.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.887
YOU'RE ALONE AND MISERABLE,
AND ILOVEIT.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.620
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!

23:10.620 --> 23:12.562
(Rashi) WOW.

23:12.562 --> 23:17.026
I JUST, UH, FORGOT MY iPod.

23:20.930 --> 23:23.673
WOW.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.107
(door closes)

23:51.731 --> 23:54.764
UH-OH. A CHARDONNAY FLOAT.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.067
DOES THAT MEAN...

23:58.067 --> 23:59.438
YES.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.842
RASHI'S GONE TO THE RETREAT
 ALONE,

24:02.842 --> 24:05.715
SO... CONGRATULATIONS.

24:05.715 --> 24:08.017
NOW I'M JUST AS MISERABLE
AS YOU ARE.

24:08.017 --> 24:11.220
DID HE... DUMP YOU?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.683
(sets down bottle)
 HE SAID NOW THAT
HE'S SEEN THE REAL ME,

24:13.683 --> 24:18.528
HE NEEDS TO MEDITATE ON WHETHER
OR NOT HE CAN STILL MARRY ME.

24:18.528 --> 24:21.891
(voice breaking)
I'M SO SCREWED, DUDE.

24:21.891 --> 24:23.663
OHH.

24:25.234 --> 24:28.798
YOU KNOW, IF HE WAS
THAT QUICK TO RUN OFF,

24:28.798 --> 24:30.600
MAYBE HE'S NOT THE GUY.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.502
HE'S THE GUY.

24:32.502 --> 24:34.804
I'M JUST NOT THE GIRL.

24:34.804 --> 24:38.247
I THOUGHT I COULD PUT
ALL THAT LOSER STUFF BEHIND ME

24:38.247 --> 24:42.952
AND ACTUALLY HAVE
A FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP.

24:42.952 --> 24:45.114
I GUESS THAT'S TOO MUCH
TO ASK FOR.

24:45.114 --> 24:47.587
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TALK TO HIM?

24:47.587 --> 24:48.788
I CAN'T.

24:48.788 --> 24:52.221
AFTER HOW I BEHAVED,

24:52.221 --> 24:56.796
I'VE BEEN TOLD MY ENERGY IS
NO LONGER WELCOME IN THE YURT.

25:08.538 --> 25:10.540
WHERE IS SHE?

25:10.540 --> 25:11.681
WHERE IS WHO?

25:11.681 --> 25:13.683
JENNY. SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE GROUNDED,

25:13.683 --> 25:16.045
BUT WHEN I WENT TO HER ROOM
TO CHECK ON HER, SHE WAS GONE.

25:16.045 --> 25:18.718
WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE.
I'VE BEEN OUT ALL AFTERNOON.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.249
I DON'T THINK I TRUST YOU.

25:21.851 --> 25:24.624
JENNY? ARE YOU IN HERE?

25:24.624 --> 25:26.225
(door closes)
 THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,
YOU KNOW.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.797
MY FAULT? HOW IS IT MY FAULT?

25:27.797 --> 25:30.600
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT SPEAKING
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.863
WE WERE A PERFECTLY HAPPY FAMILY
BEFORE YOU GOT INVOLVED.

25:33.863 --> 25:35.835
GOT INVOLVED?
YOU MADE ME TAKE HER SHOPPING

25:35.835 --> 25:37.737
'CAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
OF BOOBS!

25:37.737 --> 25:38.868
YEAH,
AND THEN YOU GLOMMED ON

25:38.868 --> 25:40.810
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
KIDS OF YOUR OWN.

25:40.810 --> 25:43.713
IT'S NOT HER FAULT!

25:43.713 --> 25:44.744
JENNY.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.877
I SNUCK IN A BACK WINDOW.

25:47.877 --> 25:48.948
SORRY.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.280
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

25:51.280 --> 25:53.853
I LIKE IT HERE.
WE DID OUR NAILS.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.855
MORE.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.087
I DON'T KNOW.

25:58.087 --> 26:01.691
SOMETIMES I THINK
IT'D BE COOL TO HAVE A...

26:01.691 --> 26:02.862
MOTHER.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.564
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.
THE "M" WORD."

26:05.564 --> 26:07.266
EASY.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.739
WHAT CAN A MOTHER DO
THAT I CAN'T?

26:09.739 --> 26:11.570
YOU WANNA DO YOUR NAILS?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.673
MANI-PEDI MONDAYS
START NEXT WEEK.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.744
YOU WANT TO TRY ON SHOES?

26:14.744 --> 26:16.105
I HAVE THE STILETTOS
THAT CHER WORE

26:16.105 --> 26:18.177
TO THE "MOONSTRUCK" PREMIERE.

26:18.177 --> 26:21.711
YOU CAN'T GO IN THE LADIES' ROOM
WITH ME.

26:21.711 --> 26:23.683
SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM?!

26:23.683 --> 26:25.314
WELL, YOU'VE GOT ME.

26:25.314 --> 26:28.658
I SEE WHY HAVING A DAD
AND A PAPA ISSOHORRIBLE.

26:28.658 --> 26:30.890
JENNY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
IN THE KITCHEN?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.693
THE LATEST "VOGUE"
IS IN THERE.

26:33.693 --> 26:37.326
WE HAVE MAGAZINES
AT OUR HOUSE, TOO!

26:37.326 --> 26:38.928
ARE YOU OKAY?

26:44.173 --> 26:46.876
THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE
COME TRUE.

26:46.876 --> 26:48.738
I'VE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS MOMENT

26:48.738 --> 26:50.740
EVER SINCE SHE CAME
INTO OUR LIVES.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.782
WHAT IF BOB AND I
AREN'T ENOUGH?

26:55.685 --> 26:57.847
WHAT IF SHEDOESNEED
A MOTHER?

26:57.847 --> 27:00.850
OH, SHUT UP.

27:00.850 --> 27:02.952
EXCUSE ME?

27:02.952 --> 27:05.825
YOUTOOK A GIRL
WHO WAS BOUNCING

27:05.825 --> 27:07.697
FROM ONE FOSTER HOME
TO ANOTHER

27:07.697 --> 27:10.800
AND GAVE HER
TWO GREAT PARENTS WHO LOVE HER.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.131
BUT YOU HEARD HER.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.233
OH, PLEASE, SHE'S A KID.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.006
TODAY SHE WANTS A MOM.
TOMORROW SHE'LL WANT A CAR.

27:17.006 --> 27:18.968
JENNY IS NOT LACKING
FOR ANYTHING,

27:18.968 --> 27:21.941
AND YOU GUYS ARE DOING
AN AMAZING JOB WITH HER.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.943
REALLY?

27:23.943 --> 27:25.274
YEAH, REALLY.

27:25.274 --> 27:27.246
SO AMAZING, THAT FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

27:27.246 --> 27:31.420
I... ACTUALLY ENJOYED
HANGING OUT WITH A KID.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.754
AW. THANK YOU.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.955
MM. (chuckles)

27:35.955 --> 27:37.787
AND I TAKE BACK
EVERYTHING I SAID

27:37.787 --> 27:40.189
ABOUT YOU BEING
AN INSENSITIVE BITCH.

27:40.189 --> 27:42.031
UH, YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

27:42.031 --> 27:45.364
DON'T OPEN YOUR E-MAIL.

27:47.436 --> 27:48.968
(melodic chimes playing)

27:48.968 --> 27:52.071
(Rashi exhales deeply)
WE ARE THE SUN,

27:52.071 --> 27:56.345
THE WARMTH RADIATING
FROM OUR HEARTS.

27:56.345 --> 28:02.051
WE ARE THE ENDLESS SEA ROLLING
BENEATH THE FOREVER SKY.

28:02.051 --> 28:07.857
WE ARE THE LEAVES.
THE WIND BLOWS US FROM TREES.

28:07.857 --> 28:10.890
(whispering) SORRY, SORRY.
STUPID WIND.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.962
WE ARE THE STARS,

28:12.962 --> 28:14.894
GLOWING, GROWING,

28:14.894 --> 28:19.198
LOSING OURSELVES
BUT GAINING THE UNIVERSE.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.000
(inhales deeply)

28:21.000 --> 28:22.101
MM--

28:22.101 --> 28:23.202
YOU GOT A SEC?

28:23.202 --> 28:24.774
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:24.774 --> 28:27.106
BESIDES TRYING NOT TO LAUGH
MY ASS OFF?

28:27.106 --> 28:28.477
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

28:28.477 --> 28:29.939
(lowered voice)
WELL, NOT NOW!

28:29.939 --> 28:31.881
MY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
MEDITATING FOR SIX HOURS.

28:31.881 --> 28:33.883
THEY ARE VERY CLOSE
TO FINDING THEIR BLISS.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.314
I'M SURE THEY CAN SPARE YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

28:35.314 --> 28:36.816
SO COME TALK TO ME,

28:36.816 --> 28:38.347
OR I WILL START SINGING
ETHEL MERMAN

28:38.347 --> 28:41.090
AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS.

28:41.090 --> 28:43.893
(loudly) ♪ THERE'S NO BUSINESS
LIKE SHOW BUSINESS ♪

28:43.893 --> 28:44.994
♪ THERE'S NO-- ♪

28:44.994 --> 28:46.756
SO SORRY.

28:46.756 --> 28:48.127
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.059
(whispers) COME ON.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.835
YOU CAN'T LEAVE LYDIA.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.737
I DON'T WANT TO,
BUT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE

28:58.737 --> 29:00.739
THAT PERSON I SAW
YELLING AT YOU.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.812
I DID. IT'S THE PERSON
I TURN HER INTO

29:02.812 --> 29:04.073
EVERY TIME WE GET TOGETHER.

29:04.073 --> 29:06.175
THE LYDIA I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
WAS THE ONE WHO BREEZED

29:06.175 --> 29:09.218
THROUGH MY HOUSE,
HAPPY AND IN LOVE.

29:09.218 --> 29:11.150
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S TOO HARD FOR ME

29:11.150 --> 29:13.482
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE
LIKE YOU AND LYDIA.

29:13.482 --> 29:16.926
THEN... EAT A ROOT
OR CHANT OR WHATEVER.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.057
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP,
OKAY?

29:18.057 --> 29:19.188
WHY NOT?

29:19.188 --> 29:21.030
BECAUSE YOU ARE EXACTLY
LIKE MY FAMILY.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.962
(sighs)

29:22.962 --> 29:25.835
MY NAME IS NOT RASHI.

29:25.835 --> 29:29.899
IT'S HERBERT BRICKMEYER,
FROM LEVITTOWN, LONG ISLAND,

29:29.899 --> 29:31.901
AND THAT ENERGY
IN YOUR KITCHEN--

29:31.901 --> 29:33.142
THAT WAS PURE BRICKMEYER,

29:33.142 --> 29:35.074
AND I CAN'T BE
AROUND THAT AGAIN.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.046
OKAY. OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

29:37.046 --> 29:41.010
LYDIA DOESN'T ACT LIKE THAT WHEN
I'M NOT PUSHING HER BUTTONS.

29:41.010 --> 29:42.381
AND EVEN IF SHE DID,
WORK IT OUT.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.814
THAT'S WHAT
A RELATIONSHIP IS.

29:44.814 --> 29:46.986
AND YOU'RE
A RELATIONSHIP EXPERT?

29:46.986 --> 29:50.319
I'M AN EXPERT
ON SCREWING THEM UP.

29:52.021 --> 29:54.463
I'M GUESSING
IT TOOK YOU A WHILE

29:54.463 --> 29:57.566
TO STOP BEING
A CRAZY LONG ISLAND BRICKMEYER,

29:57.566 --> 30:01.500
SO GIVE LYDIA A LITTLE TIME
TO FIND HER BLISS, TOO.

30:07.336 --> 30:09.038
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.842
ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT MY FAMILY'S

30:12.842 --> 30:14.583
GOT ME REALLY JONESING
FOR A CIGARETTE.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.585
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO...

30:16.585 --> 30:18.247
SORRY, HERB.

30:22.551 --> 30:25.194
(inhales deeply)

30:30.159 --> 30:31.530
(door closes)

30:32.561 --> 30:33.562
HI.

30:33.562 --> 30:35.434
HI.

30:37.506 --> 30:38.868
(keys jangle)

30:38.868 --> 30:40.509
WHAT?
 RASHI CALLED.

30:40.509 --> 30:43.272
HE HAD AN EPIPHANY
DURING THE RETREAT.

30:43.272 --> 30:46.946
HE KNOWS I'M CHANGING,
AND HE'S WILLING TO BE PATIENT.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.918
YAY!
 (laughs)

30:48.918 --> 30:50.849
AW.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.922
MWAH.

30:52.922 --> 30:54.553
HE'S RIGHT.
YOUARECHANGING.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.986
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

30:56.986 --> 30:58.427
REALLY?

30:58.427 --> 31:00.859
YEAH, REALLY, HONEY.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.292
I THINK...

31:03.292 --> 31:07.196
I THINK THAT IS WHY
I HAVE BEEN SO ROTTEN TO YOU.

31:07.196 --> 31:09.238
I'M JEALOUS.

31:13.002 --> 31:14.944
WHY?

31:16.445 --> 31:20.309
I DON'T GET IN RELATIONSHIPS,
LYDIA. I GETONTHEM.

31:20.309 --> 31:23.552
I MOUNT THEM
AND GRAB THEM BY THE HAIR

31:23.552 --> 31:25.254
AND KICK THEM IN THE SIDES

31:25.254 --> 31:27.616
UNTIL I MAKE THEM GO
WHERE I WANT.

31:27.616 --> 31:29.618
AND GOD HELP THE OTHER PERSON

31:29.618 --> 31:32.221
IF THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA
THAN ME.

31:32.221 --> 31:35.925
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND TOM?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.668
OH, YEAH.

31:39.668 --> 31:46.005
YOU CAN CHANGE, TOO,
LYNETTE.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.037
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

31:48.037 --> 31:50.439
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS
AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

31:50.439 --> 31:52.111
NO, LYNETTE.

31:52.111 --> 31:56.145
NO, BECAUSE YOU RECOGNIZE
YOUR PROBLEM NOW.

31:56.145 --> 31:59.018
AND A WISE MAN ONCE SAID

31:59.018 --> 32:00.649
THAT TO BEGIN
THE JOURNEY OF CHANGE,

32:00.649 --> 32:04.053
WE MUST PULL ON THE BOOTS
OF SELF-AWARENESS.

32:06.555 --> 32:09.098
AND WAS THAT WISE MAN RASHI?

32:09.098 --> 32:12.031
ISN'T HE ADORABLE?

32:17.666 --> 32:20.669
AND WHEN HE TALKS
TO SCOUT AND JIM,

32:20.669 --> 32:23.042
YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T WANNA
JUST DO THE RIGHT THING

32:23.042 --> 32:26.115
FOR THE COMMUNITY. HE WANTS TO
DO THE RIGHT THING AS A FATHER.

32:26.115 --> 32:27.676
I KNOW.
IT'S LIKE WHEN GREGORY PECK

32:27.676 --> 32:30.179
LOOKS AT THOSE KIDS,
YOU CAN TELL THAT HE'S--

32:30.179 --> 32:32.521
GREGORY PECK? (chuckles)

32:32.521 --> 32:34.723
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
READ THE BOOK, DID YOU?

32:34.723 --> 32:39.458
YEAH. I STARTED,
AND THEN IT WAS ON CABLE.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.631
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST TOO MANY PAGES.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.133
MIKE.

32:44.133 --> 32:45.564
WHAT?

32:47.336 --> 32:49.038
OH, GOD.
HE'S TURNING AROUND!

32:49.038 --> 32:50.499
OKAY.

32:52.601 --> 32:55.104
UH... OKAY, COME ON.

33:00.049 --> 33:02.111
(panting)

33:02.111 --> 33:03.482
DO YOU THINK HE SAW US?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.554
I DON'T KNOW.

33:05.554 --> 33:08.417
I DON'T SEE HIS TRUCK.
I THINK HE LEFT.

33:08.417 --> 33:10.459
OH, THANK GOD.

33:10.459 --> 33:13.162
WOW, THAT WAS CLOSE.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.024
YEAH, MY HEART'S POUNDING.

33:15.024 --> 33:16.725
I KNOW. I CAN FEEL IT.

33:16.725 --> 33:19.728
(breathing heavily)

33:22.171 --> 33:24.273
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

33:26.605 --> 33:27.776
NOTHING.

33:30.179 --> 33:32.141
ARE YOU SURE?

33:32.141 --> 33:35.044
YEAH. WE'RE JUST TWO FRIENDS

33:35.044 --> 33:37.746
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME AND ARE TRYING TO

33:37.746 --> 33:40.249
HELP EACH OTHER THROUGH IT,
RIGHT?

33:40.249 --> 33:43.052
THEN WHY ARE WE HIDING
IN THE BACK OF A VAN

33:43.052 --> 33:44.493
FROM MY HUSBAND?

33:49.128 --> 33:54.463
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
DO THIS ANYMORE.

33:54.463 --> 33:56.635
YEAH.

33:58.807 --> 34:00.309
(laughs)

34:00.309 --> 34:01.410
(grunts)

34:01.410 --> 34:03.112
MIKE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:03.112 --> 34:04.773
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HELPING YOUR BOYFRIEND,

34:04.773 --> 34:06.815
WE NEED TO TALK.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.317
OHH.

34:08.317 --> 34:09.348
YOU OKAY?

34:09.348 --> 34:11.780
YEAH. (groans)

34:17.286 --> 34:18.556
HELLO.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.429
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

34:21.429 --> 34:22.731
IT WAS A LITTLE STRESSFUL.

34:22.731 --> 34:25.793
AH. MINE, TOO.

34:25.793 --> 34:29.668
WE NEED TO UNWIND.
HOW ABOUT A NICE, LONG WALK?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.340
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.702
THERE'S SOMEPLACE SPECIAL
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU.

34:33.702 --> 34:36.205
OH? WHERE?

34:36.205 --> 34:37.676
(latches click)

34:40.248 --> 34:41.850
IT'S A SURPRISE.

34:41.850 --> 34:45.114
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
SURPRISES.

34:45.114 --> 34:48.257
I DO. SHALL WE?

34:48.257 --> 34:50.659
NOW?

34:50.659 --> 34:52.821
UH, CAN I FRESHEN UP FIRST?

34:52.821 --> 34:55.194
YOU LOOK PLENTY FRESH
TO ME.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.094
BUT I'VE BEEN
IN THESE CLOTHES ALL DAY.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.627
I'D REALLY LIKE TO CHANGE.

34:59.868 --> 35:02.871
OKAY.
DON'T KEEP ME WAITING.

35:07.476 --> 35:09.678
(cell phone rings)

35:09.678 --> 35:11.140
(ring, beep)

35:11.140 --> 35:13.182
(lowered voice)
BREE, HAVE YOU LEFT YET?

35:13.182 --> 35:14.483
(lowered voice)
NEW PLAN. HE'S TAKING ME OUT,

35:14.483 --> 35:16.215
AND HE'S GOT THE ENVELOPE.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.487
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
 He won't say,

35:18.487 --> 35:19.848
BUT IF HE WROTE THAT LETTER,

35:19.848 --> 35:21.390
AND HE'S BRINGING ME SOMEWHERE
WITH THE EVIDENCE...

35:21.390 --> 35:23.252
THIS IS WHEN HE GIVES YOU
THE SHAKEDOWN!

35:23.252 --> 35:25.454
I'LL FOLLOW YOU.
 (beep)

35:28.557 --> 35:30.499
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA CHANGE.

35:30.499 --> 35:32.501
I DID.

35:32.501 --> 35:34.433
MY ATTITUDE.
I DIDN'T WANNA GO,

35:34.433 --> 35:36.765
BUT NOW I DO.

35:53.882 --> 35:55.424
UH, WHAT ABOUT THAT--
THAT TABLE IN THE CORNER?

35:55.424 --> 35:56.625
WE'D LIKE SOME PRIVACY.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.487
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I HATE PRIVACY.

35:58.487 --> 36:01.490
I LIKE NOISE AND BUSTLE
AND LOTS OF PEOPLE.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.292
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE
IN THE MIDDLE?

36:03.292 --> 36:06.365
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.768
(piano playing jazz,
indistinct conversations)

36:11.940 --> 36:14.303
(sighs)

36:14.303 --> 36:16.905
OH, AREN'T YOU WARM
IN THAT JACKET?

36:16.905 --> 36:19.878
ACTUALLY, A LITTLE.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.811
(mouths words)

36:22.811 --> 36:24.883
(mouths words)

36:26.885 --> 36:31.320
SO, UM, LET'S ORDER FIRST,
AND THEN WE CAN TALK.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.921
MM.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.827
DON'T THESE APPETIZERS
SOUND DELICIOUS?

36:38.827 --> 36:41.630
(gasps) YUM!
ESCARGOT, AND I...

36:41.630 --> 36:43.402
I LOVE ONION SOUP.

36:43.402 --> 36:47.876
BUT IT'LL BE HARD TO PASS UP
ON THE BEEF TARTARE.

36:47.876 --> 36:50.879
RUSTIC COUNTRY PATE. LOOK.

36:50.879 --> 36:52.541
UH, WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

36:52.541 --> 36:54.843
IT JUST SAYS
"RUSTIC COUNTRY PATE."
 (mouths words)

36:54.843 --> 36:57.886
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK
ON THELEFTSIDE OF THE MENU.

36:57.886 --> 37:01.620
I DEFINITELY THINK WE'LL FIND
SOMETHING GOOD ON THE LEFT SIDE.

37:01.620 --> 37:05.254
WE DIDN'T GET A WINE LIST.
WHERE'S OUR WAITER?
 (silverware clinks)

37:05.254 --> 37:07.626
(moaning)

37:07.626 --> 37:08.927
MM!

37:08.927 --> 37:09.928
(chuckles)
 MM.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.460
MWAH!

37:11.460 --> 37:13.832
(gasps) WOW.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.465
WOW. (sighs)

37:16.465 --> 37:17.636
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.967
WAIT. WHERE--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

37:18.967 --> 37:19.938
TO FRESHEN UP.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.770
AGAIN?

37:23.612 --> 37:25.574
(door opens)

37:27.976 --> 37:29.918
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
IN THERE?

37:29.918 --> 37:32.281
WHAT IF IT'S A BONE?
YOU OPEN IT!

37:39.928 --> 37:40.989
OH, NO.

37:40.989 --> 37:43.261
MAYBE IT'S A TOOTH?

37:47.035 --> 37:48.797
OHH. THE PICTURE OF MY HAND--

37:48.797 --> 37:50.899
HE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
MY RING SIZE.

37:50.899 --> 37:53.672
WELL, THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MEAN HE DIDN'T SEND THE LETTER.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.004
I THINK IT DOES.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.446
OKAY, WELL,
THIS IS A RELIEF, RIGHT?

37:57.446 --> 37:59.378
I MEAN, AT LEAST
HE'S NOT BLACKMAILING YOU.

37:59.378 --> 38:02.581
NO, IT MEANS
HE WANTS TO MARRY ME.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.583
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

38:04.583 --> 38:06.915
I LIKE CHUCK,
BUT HE'S NOT THE MAN

38:06.915 --> 38:09.758
I WANNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

38:09.758 --> 38:12.891
YOU CAN GO. I'LL DO MY BEST
TO LET HIM DOWN EASY.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.995
SOME ROCK,
AND ON A COP'S SALARY?

38:18.527 --> 38:20.028
BUT YOU SHOULD
STILL DUMP HIM.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.532
(sighs)

38:27.876 --> 38:29.077
MIKE.

38:29.077 --> 38:31.410
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT,
SAY IT FAST.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.812
(door closes)
 THERE IS NO FAST WAY TO SAY IT,
BUDDY.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.416
WHAT THE HELL
AREYOUDOING HERE?

38:37.416 --> 38:40.989
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

38:50.058 --> 38:51.930
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
THE PROGRESSIVE DINNER--

38:51.930 --> 38:53.632
YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT?

38:53.632 --> 38:55.964
(sighs) JUST GET TO THE PART
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

38:59.508 --> 39:02.010
I KILLED GABY'S STEPFATHER.

39:03.972 --> 39:07.846
AND ME AND THE GIRLS
HELPED COVER IT UP.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.688
(sighs) I'M SORRY
THAT TOOK SO LONG.

39:19.688 --> 39:21.760
OH, THAT--
THAT--THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.434
(clears throat)
IT ACTUALLY GAVE ME A CHANCE

39:25.434 --> 39:27.996
TO HAVE A SCOTCH
 ANDA GLASS OF RED WINE.

39:27.996 --> 39:29.868
CALM MY NERVES A LITTLE.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.100
GOD, I WISH
I COULD HAVE A DRINK.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.773
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU
NERVOUS ABOUT?

39:34.773 --> 39:38.447
I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY.

39:38.447 --> 39:41.410
HUH. UM, I-I WONDER

39:41.410 --> 39:42.981
IF IT'S THE SAME THING
THAT I'M GONNA SAY.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.383
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.987
CHUCK,
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL MAN,

39:48.987 --> 39:52.120
AND I HAVE ENJOYED
OUR TIME TOGETHER, BUT--

39:52.120 --> 39:53.391
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.764
ARE YOU--ARE YOU...

39:55.764 --> 39:58.727
YOU'RE DUMPING ME?

40:01.169 --> 40:03.432
I WAS...

40:03.432 --> 40:05.403
I WAS ABOUT TO PROPOSE
TO YOU.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.576
I'M SORRY
IF I MISLED YOU--

40:07.576 --> 40:10.178
HEY, THERE'S A FAKE APOLOGY.
YOUDIDMISLEAD ME.

40:10.178 --> 40:13.081
CHUCK, PLEASE--
 YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE TWO PEOPLE.

40:13.081 --> 40:14.443
THERE'S THE WOMAN
I HAVE FUN WITH,

40:14.443 --> 40:17.145
WHO IREALLY...
 IREALLYCONNECT TO,

40:17.145 --> 40:18.687
AND THERE'S
THIS OTHER WOMAN WHO'S--

40:18.687 --> 40:21.750
WHO'S, UH, WHO'S MYSTERIOUS
AND--AND WEIRD

40:21.750 --> 40:26.625
AND KEEPS SNEAKING OUT
TO "RUN ERRANDS."

40:26.625 --> 40:28.597
THERE'S ANOTHER GUY,
ISN'T THERE?

40:28.597 --> 40:30.759
NO. I ASSURE YOU,
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE.

40:30.759 --> 40:32.160
DON'T LIE TO ME!

40:35.464 --> 40:38.036
WAS HE THE ONE
WHO SENT YOU THAT LETTER?

40:38.036 --> 40:40.038
WHAT LETTER?

40:40.038 --> 40:42.010
THE ONE THAT YOU, UH, YOU WERE
READING THE OTHER NIGHT,

40:42.010 --> 40:44.843
YOU GOT ALL SHOOK UP ABOUT--
WAS THAT FROM HIM?

40:44.843 --> 40:47.145
THERE IS NO "HIM."

40:47.145 --> 40:51.149
YOU KNOW, BREE, I WOULD'VE
DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU.

40:51.149 --> 40:56.024
I PROTECT THE PEOPLE
THAT I CARE ABOUT.

40:56.024 --> 40:57.726
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU NOW.

40:57.726 --> 41:01.590
SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN TROUBLE,

41:01.590 --> 41:06.965
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT SOMEDAY YOU WILL...

41:06.965 --> 41:08.466
THEN DON'T COME CALLING ME.

41:10.839 --> 41:14.803
YOU HAVE MADE
A VERY BIG MISTAKE.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.752
YES, THE RESIDENTS
OF WISTERIA LANE

41:23.752 --> 41:27.956
ARE SKILLED
AT THE ART OF CONCEALMENT.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.119
THEY KNOW HOW TO COVER

41:31.119 --> 41:34.062
THE EVIDENCE
OF A MESSY BREAKUP...

41:38.026 --> 41:39.097
TO COMPENSATE

41:39.097 --> 41:42.100
FOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN
MIGHT BE MISSING...

41:43.872 --> 41:47.836
AND TO SPARE THE FEELINGS
OF A LOVED ONE

41:47.836 --> 41:50.679
WHOSE TASTE THEY MAY NOT SHARE.

41:53.081 --> 41:54.212
BUT FOR SOME,

41:54.212 --> 41:59.287
THE ART OF CONCEALMENT
COMES AT TOO GREAT A COST.

41:59.287 --> 42:04.152
AND SO THEY FIND THEMSELVES
FORCED TO REVEAL THE TRUTH...

42:06.725 --> 42:13.201
EVEN AT THE RISK OF FACING
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.
