Yeah, that you were
gonna find me

00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:07.037
hard proof
of criminal endangerment.

00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:10.040
Instead, you've told me
what a nice kid my niece is

00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.042
and that my nephew sleeps a lot.

00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:13.419
He really does, though.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.630
Sleeping is not a crime.

00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:18.215
Is that guy okay?

00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:21.510
I just realized I shouldn't
be hearing any of this.

00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:24.388
As a matter of fact,
I shouldn't be here at all.

00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:25.890
Sit down, Doug.

00:29:27.017 --> 00:29:28.600
So, I guess we're finished here,

00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:31.228

has a brilliant idea,

00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:33.647
which I realize
is highly unlikely.

00:29:38.778 --> 00:29:41.280

00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:44.616

- Mike was saying that...

00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:48.954
he really needs this new job
to, like, look good on paper

00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:51.165
for the judge or something.

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.708
Well, that's all
very fascinating, honey,

00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:54.961
but I am not hearing a plan.

00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:57.505
We toss the place.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.050
Go on. -Well,
he's a security guard, right?

00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:03.927
His job is to make sure
nobody gets in.

00:30:03.928 --> 00:30:07.181
So, we get in,

00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:09.141
and we mess up the place good.

00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:11.602
We help ourselves to whatever
we find along the way.

00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.479
Your nephew gets canned.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.774

and you give us...

00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:19.361
$2,000.

00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:22.113

00:30:22.906 --> 00:30:26.033

and don't mess it up.

00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.534

If you're too whacked out

'Cause the moment
I file that report,

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.034
it's out of my hands.

00:49:57.038 --> 00:49:59.374
You want to take a walk?

00:50:03.044 --> 00:50:05.755
So I used to have a brother.

00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.051
His name was Garrett.

00:50:11.386 --> 00:50:13.846
(sighs) And when I was...

00:50:13.847 --> 00:50:16.348
about 12,

00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.768
he was, uh, he was taken.

00:50:20.145 --> 00:50:22.480
And I was there
when it happened.

00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:26.025
They never found
the guy who did it,

00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:27.652
and they never found my brother.

00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:36.994
So there's this theory that,
uh, we can't forget things.

00:50:36.995 --> 00:50:39.997
Basically, it says that
every single thing that you see

00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:42.791
in your entire life,
down to the tiniest of details,

00:50:42.792 --> 00:50:44.710
gets stored inside of you.

00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:48.047
You just have to know
how to look.

00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:50.215
Your brother...

00:50:50.216 --> 00:50:52.343
You think you saw who took him?

00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:54.345
I know I did.

00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:56.847
And I know that he's in here,
but he's just... he's...

00:50:56.848 --> 00:50:58.057
It's buried.

00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.059
So every night, I dream,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.477
and I go back
to that same memory,

00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:03.729
and I-I search for details.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:06.649
For any little thing
that got overlooked.

00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:14.031
Yeah.

00:51:14.032 --> 00:51:16.576
And that's usually the part
where people tell me I'm crazy.

00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:20.788
I know what crazy
looks like, Mike.

00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:22.748
This isn't it.

00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:24.793
Not even close.

00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:28.337
And these?

00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:30.714

to the same dream,

00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:32.424
the same place
night after night,

00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:35.094
it's not easy,
so the-the pills help.

00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:36.345
Some other things,

00:51:36.346 --> 00:51:38.263
like familiar sights,
familiar sounds.

00:51:38.264 --> 00:51:39.932

00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:41.475

00:51:49.025 --> 00:51:50.901
Yeah.

00:51:50.902 --> 00:51:53.445
Yeah, it's just us.

00:51:53.446 --> 00:51:56.616

a little while back.

00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:01.329
And Dad,
he couldn't handle it, so...

00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:04.581
You know what's crazy is, uh,

00:52:04.582 --> 00:52:06.625
when... when Garrett and I
were kids,

00:52:06.626 --> 00:52:09.294
they were like
those perfect parents

00:52:09.295 --> 00:52:11.339
you'd see on old TV shows.

00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:16.301
Yeah, ev-every night,
we would sit down together,

00:52:16.302 --> 00:52:17.845
we'd have family dinner,

00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:20.640
and we'd hold hands
and say grace, and...

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.392
That actually sounds
really nice.

00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:28.356
Yeah, at the time,
I thought it was really cheesy.

00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:32.944
But then it's gone.

00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:40.952
You and Abby,
you still have each other.

00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:45.623
From where I sit,
I'd say you're lucky.

00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:50.502
